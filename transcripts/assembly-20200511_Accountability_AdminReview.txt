AT A TIME LIKE THIS. AND ASK VITAL QUESTIONS OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE STILL ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY EVEN AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS LIKE THIS WHAT HAVE WE DONE AND- US PRICES. YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE. OR NAY. URGENCY WE'VE HAD IN THE STATE OF WE PRO. GUIDELINES DO WE STILL FOLLOW HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC DOLLAR WAS STILL BEING WELL SPENT AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY'S HEARING SHE THE OPPORTUNITY- TO BE A PART OF THIS HEARING ON OR TO.

AND SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO BRING SUNSHINE TO THIS AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. BE A PART OF THIS AND ALSO TO- HAVE A COUPLE OF OPENING REMARKS. THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IS TO. I THINK SEND OUT KUDOS WERE KUDOS OR DO PARTICULARLY. TO THE ESTATE TREASURE FEEL TOMORROW I THINK SHE HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB PARTICULARLY IN ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT THAN WHAT SOME HAVE TERM SORT OF A FISHY- THE CONTRACT. OF AND AS A RESULT THIS BLUE FLAME DEAL PROBABLY HEAR MORE ABOUT IT. A HUNDRED MILLION AND NINETY FIVE MASKS THEY WERE BANKERS INVOLVED THAT'S AWESOME REAL FISHY. THINGS GOING ON. THE CALIFORNIA NOW TREASURER. DID SOME REALLY GOOD WORK A LOOK INTO THIS AS WELL. AND REALLY DID HER JOB WELL- AND THEN SHE CALLED THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND SAID THERE IS SOMETHING FIFTY. GOING ON HERE SO I WANT TO COMMEND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING A WATCHDOG IN AND TAKING ON RESPONSIBILITY OF DOING THEIR- THEIR DUE DILIGENCE- THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. BUT WE DO HAVE A COLLECTION. OF CONTRACTS THAT ARE EITHER HAVE BORDERLINE FAILED OR OR HAVE FAILED. BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WITH BLUE FLAME A BILLION WITH B. Y. DE. EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION WITH- BEAR MOUNTAIN THAT'S NEARLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRACTS WITH SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES. AND SO I HAVE A TWO OR THREE QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ASK LATER ON THE FLESH OUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT SOME OF US HAVE ABOUT THIS. INCREASE APR UNITY OF BEING A PART OF THIS AS- MY FRIEND I'M A CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. POINTED OUT THE THIS DIFFICULT DUTY. AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED TO HAVE. CLARITY BUT WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY- AND SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THANKFULLY TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE. OBVIOUSLY LOOK AT IT AND SAY WELL THAT WAS A KIND OF A GOOF. BUT ALSO FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT WE DON'T MAKE THOSE GROUPS AGAIN GOING FORWARD. AND THE FUNDAMENTAL THING I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE OUT OF ALL OF THIS. IS TO GET THE REAP VERSUS THE QUALITY COMPANIES THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THAT CAN PERFORM THEIR CONTRACTS. YEAH PP EASE INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT NEED THEM THE MOST WELL WE CAN'T HAVE IS ANOTHER. THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF IF THE CONTRACT. AND I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. DO SOME OF THE DUE DILIGENCE AND SOME OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE WILL DO. Q. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY REMARKS. REX SCENE NINE- WILL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PANEL I DIRECTOR KILLER DG THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE. HI WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. ABOUT THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN GLOBAL PANDEMIC. PARTICULARLY THE STATE'S FIRST EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF LIFESAVING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ARE AS WE HAVE COME TO KNOW IT PP. THIS IS REALLY BEEN THE LARGEST DISASTER LOGISTICS AND COMMODITY DISTRIBUTION OPERATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR STATE. TO WORKING ALL PREVIOUS DISASTER OPERATIONS AS YOUR WHERE ARE AND AS HAS BEEN REPORTED ALMOST NONSTOP BY THE MEDIA THE WORLD MEDIA THIS PANDEMIC ALMOST IMMEDIATELY CAUSED AND CONTINUES TO CALL US A WITH WIDE SHORTAGE OF PP. WITH HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS HERMANCE AND PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESSES SIMULTANEOUSLY COMPETING FOR SCARCE RESOURCES PARTICULARLY AND NINETY FIVE MASKS. GOVERNMENT INCLUDING OUR OWN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SPARED FROM THIS. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE PANDEMIC WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH MALL THIS AND PROJECTIONS THAT INDICATED OUR MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS A GREAT RISK OF BEING OVER ON. B. E. WAS IN SHORT SUPPLY AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE RAISING. OF THE ALARM THAT THEY HAD INSUFFICIENT STOCKPILES. WITHOUT A P. B. MEDICAL PROVIDERS WOULD LIKELY BECOME INFECTED THEMSELVES REDUCING THE CAPACITY OF. THE SYSTEM WHEN WE NEEDED IT MOST. STATE YOUR PLACE IN THE POSITION OF COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER AGAINST OUR OWN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WITH GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. WITH THE SAME PRECIOUS RESOURCE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PRODUCTION OF PP OCCURS IN CHINA. WITH SOME SPECIFIC ITEMS ITALY. BOTH EPICENTERS OF MAJOR VIRUS OUTBREAKS AND IMPACTS. IN FACT IN CHINA THE SCALE AND SPREAD OF THE VIRUS RESULTED IN EITHER THE SHUT DOWN OF THE MAJORITY OF PP MANUFACTURING. DIRECTLY THIS INCLUDED COMPANIES MF THAT MANUFACTURED THE AND NINETY FIVE MASKS SURGICAL MASKS GOGGLES GALLONS FACE SHIELDS AND GLOVES. IN IN THE PROVINCE WHERE THE OUTBREAK WAS MOST SEVERE WAS WHERE THE WORLD'S PRODUCTION OF CRITICALLY NECESSARY SWABS FOR TESTING WERE MANIFEST. AND WHILE WE WERE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE MYSTIC SUPPLIERS. THEM THE MAJORITY DEPENDED ON THOSE FOREIGN SOURCES OF MANUFACTURING THAT I JUST MENTIONED AND MATERIALS. AND THEY WERE EITHER UNABLE TO FILL ORDERS WERE NOT ABLE TO START SUPPLYING THE QUANTITY NEEDED UNTIL FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY. AS WITH ALL OUR NORMAL STATE SUPPLIERS OF PP THAT WE HAVE ON CONTRACT HAD NO ACCESS TO AND NINETY FIVE OR MOST OF THE OTHER COMMODITIES. BY MARCH. MOVING REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF WORST CASE SCENARIO MODELING AND ASSOCIATE ASSISTING THE PP NEED. WE WERE ABLE TO SET A TARGET GOAL OF PURCHASING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND NINETY FIVE MASKS. FOUR HUNDRED BILLION SURGICAL MASKS TWO HUNDRED MILLION FACE SHE BILLS ONE BILLION NITRILE GLOVES SETS. AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION GAPS. THIS WOULD BE THE SUPPLY OUR HOSPITAL CARE SYSTEMS ARE RESPOND EARNERS ARE- SENIOR CARE FACILITIES ETCETERA. AT THE SAME TIME THE NUMBER OF AND NINETY FIVE MASS. WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SOURCE WAS LESS THAN ONE MILLION. WE WERE ALREADY SEEN AT THAT TIME PRICES ON AVERAGE OF SIX TO SEVEN DOLLARS PER MASK. WITH THIS HIGHEST TWELVE DOLLARS PER MASK. I WANT TO REPEAT THAT SIX TO SEVEN DOLLARS PER MASK AS HIGH AS TWELVE DOLLARS BASS. THIS WAS NOT UNIQUE THE CALIFORNIA THIS WAS ALL THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. HUNDREDS OF VENDORS WE'RE CALLING WHOMEVER THEY COULD IN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AS WELL AS MANY OF OUR ELECTED LEADERS INCLUDING BABIES MY VIEW AT THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS ALL SAY THEY HAD A LINE ON SLICE. AND COULD DELIVER IMMEDIATELY. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THIS WAS THE WILD WILD WEST. IT WAS ACTUALLY THE WILD WILD WORLD. THE MARKET IS BEYOND VOLATILE. THE STATE HAD VERY LITTLE LEVERAGE TO BARGAIN WITH JUST AS WE WERE NOTIFIED OF A POTENTIAL SOURCE AND THE SOURCE APPEAR LEGITIMATE IT WAS LOST TO ANOTHER BUYER. GIVEN THE OVERWHELMING GLOBAL NEED IT WAS A SELLER'S MARKET AND THE SELLERS RIDDICK TV NEGOTIABLE TERMS. INCLUDING ADVANCE PAYMENT OTHER TERMS TO WHICH THE STATE WOULD NOT NORMALLY AGREE. I THINK IT WOULD HELP TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT AS WE GOT UP TO THIS POINT. SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTOOD NORMALLY OF THE SITUATION. IN JANUARY AS COVERT NINETEEN BECAUSE THE ENTIRE CITY OF WUHAN IN THE WHO BY PROVINCE OF CHINA TO QUARANTINE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CREATION PLAN CALIFORNIA ROSE TO MEET THE NEED WHEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT BEGAN REPATRIATION FLIGHTS TO BRING AMERICAN CITIZENS HOME. CALLAWAY YES AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND WORK WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

FOR LANDED MARCH YOUR BASS TRAP FOR SPACE MARIE CORPS STATION MIRAMAR IN LATE JANUARY AND EARLY FEBRUARY. CALIFORNIA'S SERVED AS THE FOR THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS TO RETURN HOME SAFELY THIS REQUIRE CLOSE COORDINATION ON THE STATE'S PART. WITH NOT ONLY MULTIPLE FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO LOCAL FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY LOGISTIC NEEDS IS APPROPRIATE SHOULD BRING MATHIS OF FOR THE RE CREATED CITIZENS. WHO WERE THE FOURTEEN A POTTERY. THE US TO TRIPLE. TRY WHICH WE COULD INTENSIFY OF IMMEDIATELY RETURNING TO THE U. S. WITH ALMOST ALL PASSING THROUGH OR ENDING UP IN CALIFORNIA. ON FEBRUARY FIRST WERE SIX CONFIRMED. COVERT NINETEEN CASE CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. YOU TO MY IS AND LOCAL DEPARTMENTS ON CONTACT BEING. STATE IN LATE FEBRUARY THE STATE ENHANCES CAPABILITIES DEDICATED TO COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE AFTER THE FIRST CASE A COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION. IN THE STATE OF KURT. AND I DO HAVE AN FROM TIMELINE TO GIVE YOU SOME KIND OF THAT AS WELL AS A- I'M MORE FOR THE GOVERNOR THE DECLARED A STATE EMERGENCY STATEWIDE TO BUILD ON THE WORK ALREADY UNDER WAY BY THIS. AND ENGAGE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. IN A- OF A HIGHER OPEN NINETEEN INFECTION THAT WE EXPECTED. AT THE SAME TIME SOURCE REQUEST FOR PP ALREADY ACCELERATING PROMPTING THE STATE OPERATION CENTERS CENTER TO BEGIN DISTRIBUTING THE TWENTY ONE MILLION. FIVE MATH WE HAD IN OUR RESERVE. THEN ON MARCH SIX CALLOW YES RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THAT THE GRAND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP WAS HEADED BACK. TO THE STATE OF. WHAT THIS NORMALLY PORTED IN SANFORD IN IT WE WENT TO BEFORE COMING BACK TO CALIFORNIA TO OFF LOAD IN PICK UP PASS. OR AGAIN SETTING SAIL AWAY. THEN WHY IS THAT THERE AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF SICK PEOPLE ON THE SHIP. CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED THE CDC AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WITH SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE SORTIES TRANSPORTING MEDICAL STAFF AND NECESSARY PP OUT AND PRINCESS WHILE STILL IT'S- THIS INCLUDED TESTING STAFF AND PASSENGERS ON BOARD AND SO EVACUATIONS. OF SICK IT. BRING IN EX INVOLVING MULTIPLE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE A PLAN FOR THE SHIP TO BIRTH AT A SEAT LOCATION AT THE PORT. SURE THE PASSENGERS TWENTY ONE OF THAT. SEVEN TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVERT EIGHTEEN COULD DISEMBARK SAFELY AND RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT. THE FIRST PASSENGERS DISEMBARKED ON MARCH NINTH AND THE LAST PASSAGE OF THE SUPPORT ON MARCH SIXTEENTH. ALL PASSENGERS INCLUDING ALL OTHER U. S. IT IS AND FOREIGN NATIONALS QUARANTINE TRAVIS FOR SPACE MORE AIR STATION AND OTHER IF. ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE. THERE WAS NO CALL NINE SPREAD INTO THE COMMUTER. BEFORE RETURNING HOME. THIS WAS A MAJOR OPERATION IN THE RIGHT. ANY DEMANDED AN EXTENSIVE REQUIREMENT UP FOR CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE LARGE QUANTITIES OF THE EMBEDDED PERSONNEL AND THE JUST FOR THE US HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES YOU SEE. THIS CALL NINETEEN CONTINUE ANNOUNCED THAT OTHER MEANS OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR MORE SHOULD BE RESCHEDULED TO CANCEL AND GATHERINGS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR SEVERE ILLNESS FROM CARPET NINETEEN. TO NUMBER. FOR ALL FOLLOWING SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINE. OUR MARCH SIXTEENTH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE GUIDANCE RECOMMENDED THAT ADULTS OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND THOSE WHO COMPROMISED INSIST OR SERIOUS CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH QUARANTINE AT HOME. I'M NOT. THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE BORDER URGING ALL CALIFORNIA A CENTRAL CALIFORNIA IS TO REMAIN A NONESSENTIAL CALIFORNIA TO REMAIN HOME A FIRST. STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO. TWENTY THE GUY THE REQUESTED AND THE PRESIDENT APPROVED A MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION FOR CAL YEAH FOR DIRECT BUT WAS. EMERGENCY PROTECT. AT THIS AGAIN CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE A MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATION. THE SAME WEEK FOLLOW REQUEST BY THE STATE U. S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY CALIFORNIA'S RECEIVED. ITS INITIAL ALLOTMENT OF PP FROM THE STREET THE NATIONAL STOCKPILE. THIS A LOT MEANT. HOWEVER WAS 25% OF WHAT WAS EXPECTED AND OF THAT BATTLE ALLOTMENT WAS SHORT IN QUANTITY. THIS A LOT MAY CONSIST OF ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND 580-003-0080 ONE AND NINETY FIVE MASKED EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND SEVEN EARNED THIRTY SURGICAL MESH. WHAT HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTY FIVE SHE 1-003-000-0540 FOUR SURGICAL GOWNS SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT FOR ALL. SEVEN HUNDRED AT THE ONE THOUSAND AND FORTY ONE GLOVE SETS. THROUGHOUT THE ENSUING. THE STATE CONTINUE TO REQUEST REQUEST FOR OUR FULL ALLOTMENT OF THE NATIONAL STOCKPILE. AND IN A MORE TO FASHION THAN WHAT THE FIRST ALLOTMENT AND THAT. AS WE WERE ALREADY FALLING BEHIND ON AVAILABILITY OF PP. IN ALL THE STATE ONLY RISK. ALL TIME ONLY 75% OF OUR TOTAL ALLOTMENT. AS REFERENCE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF S. AND S. SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND NINETY FIVE TEN MILLION SURGICAL MASS SIX THOUSAND GALLONS THREE THOUSAND FEET SHE'LL SIX AND GLOCK THOUSAND GOGGLES. ONE HUNDRED COVER IN AND WE ONLY RECEIVED 25% ALSO ON TOP OF THAT THE ESSENCE ALSO BEING SHORT ON EXPECT THE PPV QUANTITIES SPOKE TO THE PP SHORTAGE CHALLENGE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF WAS ALSO FACING AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF SOURCES. COMMODITY THE TIME HE FOUND. WELL HELLO WAS WORKING TO SECURE PP OUR OWN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNBEKNOWNST TO US. AT EMBARK ON THEIR A STRATEGIC APPROACH. THEY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH WITH SEVERAL OF THE NATION'S LARGEST MEDICAL SUPPLY COMPANIES. THE LAUNCH IT IS BEING COME TO WHAT IS COME TO BE KNOWN AS OPERATION YOUR BRIDGE. THE OPERATION WHICH IS ON GOING TODAY CONSISTED OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UTILIZING DOD CONTRACT AIRCRAFT AND BUYERS. SCOUR PP MANUFACTURERS IN CHINA TO OBTAIN AS MUCH PP AS POSSIBLE. THE US GOVERNMENT WOULD THEN BRING THE COMMODITIES BACK TO THE U. S. TO DISTRIBUTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER 50% ACOSTA TWENTY TO SELL TO THEIR CUSTOMERS NORMALLY HOSPITALS 20% TO THE MEDICAL SUPPLY COMPANY TO SELL TO OTHERS. INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR PP WITH PRIORITY TO HOT SPOT PORTIONS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH AT THE TIME WAS NEW YORK NEW JERSEY MICHIGAN AREA. AND THIRTY TO FIFTY MA FOR PATIENTS THE STRATEGIC NOW UPON THIS PROGRAM WALL JUST NOW STARTING TO EASE SOME OF THE BACKLOG OF PP REQUIRED. IN HOSPITAL CPAS PLEA. LITTLE COMPOUND THE FALSE STAGE WERE FOR ENOUGH PP THROUGH SOURCING. WHAT WAS LEFT COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED- IN THE ASIAN MARKET WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WAS LEFT COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED IN THE ASIAN MARKET WAS ALMOST 1% IN ADDITION TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACED WITH ONGOING LIMITED COMMODITIES THAT REQUIRED EXTENSIVE NAVIGATION. ARMONK VENDORS FRAUD. PROMISES NOT CAPPED OVERSTATED CAPABILITIES AND AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES WORKING HARD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION. FURTHER WE WERE ALSO SEEN CASES WHERE STATE'S WORST WERE SUCCESSFULLY GETTING PP FORCE FIELD ONLY TO HAVE THOSE SHIPMENTS DIVERTED ORDER SUPERSEDED THE US GOVERNMENT. WE IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA LAW SHIPMENTS OF SWAMPS AND SHIELDS TO THIS SITUATION AND WE HAVE SEEN THE VERSIONS OF THREE M. AND NINETY FIVE MASS BORDER. TO THE U. S. GOVERNMENT. LASTLY GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF VOLATILITY IN THE PP MARKET AND THE AMOUNT OF CRITICISM THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WAS GETTING. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT STARTED TO SHUT DOWN PP MANTA ACTORS AND STOP SHIP AND COME UP HE'S OUT OF CHINA. AGAIN THIS SIR YES WE LOST SEVERAL CRITICAL AND NINETY FIVE ORDERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS. EVEN WITH THE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE OF ALL THIS GOING ON. WITH THE NEED TO RAPIDLY MOVE TO GET PP FOR LIFESAVING OPERATIONS. IN REAL TIME IN CONTRAST TO WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED. IN THE MEDIA THE PROCUREMENT TEAM I USE THE EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE- IT IS INSURED BY NO MONEY HAS LOST AND WE ONLY PAY FOR WHAT OF. SEE COMPARE TO OTHER STATE THAT FORTY FIVE AND A POTENTIALLY LOS THEM. LET ME BE CLEAR. AS THE PRESSURE TO PROCURE LIFESAVING EQUIPMENT THE THOUSANDS OF OFFERS COMING IN TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THE PROMISES OF DELIVERIES NOT MAD. WITH OUR EXTENSIVE READY THAT WAS IN PLACE AT THE TIME- OUR SAFETY NET THAT WE USE THROUGH NORMAL DISASTER OPERATIONS AND PROCUREMENT. BUT THEN NOW HAVING TO DO IT IS LITERALLY ON STEROIDS I GUESS YOU COULD SAY WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME FRAMES AND RECALL AS WE HAD- IT WAS. I'M REALLY AMERICA ALL IN MANY WAYS THAT THERE WASN'T MORE- CHALLENGES THAT WE- WE HAD. SOME WATER- MY BACK MY MASS. OVER THE DUE TO MANY OF THESE HEARINGS WITH A MASK ON SO. NOW WE KNOW HOW DOCTORS AND NURSES MUST FEEL BEING IN THESE MASS ALL THEIR- UP. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE CHALLENGES. WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH THAT RESULTED IN AS ENHANCING OUR VETTING ENHANCING OUR EXISTING VETTING PROCESS. IN REAL TIME GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. OF THE NEW NORM- THAT WE WERE FACING WITH REGARDS TO- IN THAT WITH REQUIREMENTS AT HAND. THIS IS ONE THAT. WAS REFERENCED EARLIER IN THE OPENING COMMENTS BY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MARCH TWENTY THIRD ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF LEADS COMING IN THAT DAY. OUR HELLO YES WE RECEIVED A REFERRED A REFERRAL ABOUT A COMPANY CALLED BLUE FLAME. AND FOR THE COMPANY TO GIGI YES SERVING IN ITS ROLE AS OUR JUDICATA- WE CALL EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTION SEVEN- TO DO THAT AS IT IS DONE COUNTLESS TIMES. THE VENDOR INDICATE VENDOR INDICATED THAT. THEY HAD ONE HUNDRED MILLION AND NINETY FIVE MASKS IN THE PORT OF LOS LONG BEACH. THE DDS TEAM ASK THE CALIFORNIA BASED OWNER QUESTIONS. TO ASSESS WHETHER THE COMPANY ACTUALLY HAVE THE PRODUCT AND COULD DELIVER IT. THE CALLER CONFIRMED THAT HE HAD MASS AND OFFERED AGAIN THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION AND NINETY FIVE MASS. THE CALLER PROVIDED A QUOTE AT FOUR DOLLARS AND SEVENTY SIX CENTS PER MASK WHICH AT THE TIME WAS ONE OF THE LOWEST WE HAD SEEN. OUR TO DATE COMPARED TO PURCHASES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AT EIGHT FIFTY AND FIVE FIFTY AND FIVE DOLLARS. THE CALLER PROVIDED PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS THAT MET STATE pPROVIDED A SHIPPING SCHEDULE CALL PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE MANUFACTURER. THE INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS A COMPANY OWNER. WHO INDICATED THAT HE WAS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WHO HAD A BUSINESS IN GOOD STANDING REGISTER WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THE COMPANY WAS A US COMPANY USING AN AMERICAN BANK. THE CALL ALSO INDICATED THAT THEY BE THAT THEY WOULD REQUIRE ADVANCE PAYMENT WHICH WAS THE STANDARD AT THE TIME THERE WAS BE REQUIRED ON ANYONE SUPPLYING DIRECT. SUPPLIES FROM CHINA GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE. AGAIN IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THAT WAS GOING ON AND THE NEED TO MOVE SWIFTLY AS WELL AS THE CONCERN TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY PP THAT THE VENDOR APPEAR TO HAVE THE SUPPLY AT A GOOD PRICE AND GIVEN THE INFORMATION OBTAINED REAR YOU'D THAT DID NOT DEPICT. ANY DEROGATORY INFORMATION OF ME THE TEAM MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ORDER. OF THE AS WELL THE TEAM AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER WAS BALANCING THAT ORDER WITH AN ORDER WITH DOMESTIC THREE AM CORPORATION AT THE SAME TIME- TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY SOURCE A SIMILAR A NUMBER OF MASKS. INCLINATION OF THE TEAM. PASS THROUGH THREE AM. HOWEVER THREE M. CAME BACK AND INDICATED THAT THE TIME THEY COULD NOT DELIVER THE PRODUCT AND TO DAY THEY'RE STILL HAVING TROUBLE DELIVERING PRODUCTS. OF THE MULTIPLE CHECKS AND BALANCE THIS WAS ONE THAT WAS IDENTIFIED. ULTIMATELY UP BY THE BANK- AS WE MOVE WE DID WIRE MONEY ON THIS ONE APPEARED TO BE LEGITIMATE UP. AND THE- THANKS NORM. WATER ORDER TO THE STATE AND REPORTED TO THE STATE TO THE TREASURER AND TO DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES- LITERALLY SIMULTANEOUSLY. TO DATE. WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CANCEL THIS ORDER AS A REMAINS OPEN PENDING AN INVESTIGATION. THIS ONE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE COUNTLESS NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THAT WERE GOING ON THAT REPRESENTED SOME FORM OF- MISS REPRESENTATION- OR POSSIBLY FRAUD IN A TIME. WHEN THE BILL THE OUR PUBLIC SAFETY ALL OF US WERE RESPONDING TO BE ABLE TO SOURCE MATERIAL IN PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT. IN ALL GIVEN THE THOUSANDS OF COMMODITIES VETTED THE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO SOURCE AND THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AND THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH. THERE WERE EMILY THE FEW THAT REQUIRED US TO EITHER CANCEL THE CONTRACT OR SEEK REIMBURSEMENT. HE ROBIN ENTIRE ENDEAVOR AND WE'RE TALKING% ABOUT TEN THOUSANDS OF ORDERS. TO DATE NOT ONE DIME. NOT ONE DIME OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS HAS BEEN LOST. IT IS BECOME VERY CLEAR TO US THAT GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE VOLATILE COMPETITIVE MARKET FUEL BY SCARCE RESOURCES. THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF D. B. M. THE UNPREDICTABLE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ALONG WITH. ALL OF THIS ACTIVITY THAT WAS GOING ON- BY PEOPLE WHO WERE JUST NEFARIOUS- THAT WE NEEDED TO- YOU KNOW. CONTINUE DOWN A PATH BACK YES ULTIMATELY. OUR ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE WAS GET. AND I'LL CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH WHERE WE WERE GOING ONE OFFS AND BEING ABLE TO PULL FROM ONE VENDOR ANOTHER WAS ON SYSTEM WILL. WE NEEDED A MORE JIJIGA PRO WHICH- WE LEVERAGE THE SYSTEMS IN CONCEPTS WE HAVE UTILIZED IN MANY PREVIOUS DISASTERS TO DEVELOP A MULTI PRONGED STRATEGY. TO BUILD A MORE LEVEL I AM ALL IT'S A STATE OF A PIPELINE. TO MEET THE NEEDS NOW. AND FOR THE DURATION OF THE EVENT. AS WELL UP HERE FOR THE NEEDS NECESSARY TO RE OPEN THE ECONOMY. AS IN FEES WILL NEED TO UTILIZE PP IN ORDER TO MOCK MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL COVERT NINETEEN INFECTION. WE SET A PATH TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE RELIABLE CAPABILITY THAT WOULD MOVE US FROM A DEFENSIVE POSITION TO AN OFFENSE OF ONE. THIS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING. ONE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH TRUSTED NGOS PARTNERS VENDORS AND SEEK DONATIONS TO SOURCE COMMODITIES. TRUE WE WOULD IDENTIFY AND ESTABLISH A SUSTAINABLE AND ROUTE OR LIABLE PIPELINE OF PP BUT ONLY FOR AND NINETY FIVE IN SEARCH OF MASS IN ESSENCE THIS WILL BE INVESTMENT IN A MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY THAT WE WOULD. THAT WOULD BE DEDICATED TO SEE. FORMULA TO WORK WITH FEMA AND DOD TO SOURCE AND BRING INTO THE STATE THE CAPABILITY TO DISINFECT AND REPURPOSE AND NINETY FIVE MASKS. WE WILL WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE STRATEGY WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SOURCE THROUGH VENDORS AND NGOS CONTINUE TO TAKE DONATIONS FOR A NUMBER OF NECESSARY COMMODITIES. AS WELL WE BEEN DOING TO BE WHY THE MOTORS A CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY WAS SIGNIFICANT MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY CHINA. BEING OFTEN IN Y. DE ABILITIES TO SOURCE ME. IN FACT BE WHY HE HAS BEEN PROVIDING SURGICAL MASK TO US NOW. WHAT WITH MORE THAN THIRTY TWO MILLION DELIVERED. THESE MASS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL TO HELPING US OPEN OUR STATE AGAIN. THE OTHER PART OF THIS CONTRACT WAS A SUSTAINABLE PIPELINE OF SCARCE AND NINETY FIVE MASS. THIS PORTION OF CONTRACT. IS CONTINGENT UPON B. Y. DE OBTAINING DIOS CERTIFICATION THIS IS A NATIONAL CERTIFICATION SAFETY CERTIFICATION. WHILE WE EXPECTED THIS UP- THIS CERTIFICATION IN EARLY MAY WHICH WHICH IS THE UP THE WORK OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH FEMA THE FDA ON THIS EFFORT WE LEARNED THAT THAT- THE CERTIFICATION WITH WOULD NOT BE. OF PROVIDE A MAY YOU'RE NOW. AT THE END OF MAY OR THE FIRST WEEK IN JUNE. IF THE CERTIFICATION IS NOT IN CALIFORNIA GETS A 100% OF ITS FUN BACK. THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA AS OUTLINED IN THE CONTRACT. AND THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN RELEASED. THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACTOR CLEAR. SPECIFICALLY OUTLINES ALL THE SAFETY PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA. TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS AS IF HE DIDN'T KEEP. A TIGHT LINE FOR FIVE THREE. THAT WILL BE RE. TO THE STATE AND IT. AS WELL IN WORKING TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE PIPE. WE SAW THE ENGAGEMENT INNOVATION MANUFACTURING POWER WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE COMPANIES RETOOL PRODUCTION LINES TO MAKE AT SCALE NEEDED COMMODITIES OR SERVICES.

THE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT UNIT. THE VALIDATION GROUP THEN PRIORITIZES THEIR REVIEW OF THE RESOURCES BASED ON WHAT THE VENDOR SAYS. THE QUALITY PRODUCT AND THE LEAD TIME FOR SHIPMENT MEETING THE PROCUREMENT GOALS EACH VALIDATION GROUP UTILIZES APPROPRIATE SPECIFICATIONS CRITERIA ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR PRODUCT LINE FOR REVIEWING SUPPLIES AND ALL REACH OUT TO THE VENDOR TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMMODITY AS REQUIRED. BASED ON THE REVIEW THEY WILL EITHER DISQUALIFY THE RESOURCE OR SEND IT TO THE PROCUREMENT GROUP. THEY WILL SEND AN EMAIL AT THE TIME STATING THE OUTCOME OF THE REVIEW THE PROCUREMENT GROUP.

FACTOR AS WELL AS A COMPONENT TO THE STATE'S ENHANCE VETTING PROCESS WE INCORPORATED PROCEDURES. AND ONGOING CHECKS AND BALANCES IN REAL TIME FOR THE PROCUREMENT GROUP TO ACCESS AND COORDINATE WITH IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. TO TRY TO GET AS MUCH OF THESE- GROUPS AS POSSIBLE. THIS STRATEGY IS ALIGNED WITH THE GOVERNOR SIX INDICATORS AND FOUR STAGES FOR RE OPENING THE STATE. IT FOR MY DEGREE IF WE- THE FIVE MEDICAL HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES. AND TROUT. I GO TRANSPORTATION AND A SEC CAP. HIGHER EFFORTS TO SHOULD PP BURN RATES OF EXISTING PP AN IMMEDIATE NEEDS TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS THIS STRATEGY WILL BE FURTHER REFINED AS PP REQUIREMENTS FROM ADDITIONAL SET INCLUDE MANUFACTURING CONSTRUCTION FOOD SERVICE EXCEPT FOR A INCLUDING GOVERNMENT BY THE WAY. IT WILL BE ABLE TO AT THE RECALL OF THIS BODY- MOVE OVER FORTY THOUSAND- SURGICAL MASKS SO THAT THIS BODY. COULD MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR FUTURE- GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS THESE PROJECTIONS ARE ALSO BASED ON WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TO BE FEDERAL EFFORTS TO DIRECTLY PROVIDE P. PETER HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. STING HEALTHCARE DISTRIBUTORS AS WELL AS TO DIRECTION RENTS THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. DISTRIBUTION OF STRATEGY FOR STATE PARK CONTACT A CONTRACT AND NINETY FIVES PROCEDURE MASSING CLOTH MASS INCLUDES A PROCESS FOR PRIORITIZING AND DISTRIBUTING PP TO HEALTH AND NON HEALTH SECTORS DURING THE EMERGENCY PHASE. THE SECOND PHASE INCLUDE. AGREEMENT FOR THOSE SECTORS TO PURCHASE THEIR OWN OUR DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES IS WORKING ON BUILDING UP OF THE CAPABILITY FOR A GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER ENTITIES TO IDENTIFY PROCURE PEE PEE ON THEIR OWN. LAST WE WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES UP LOWERS LAWYERS ON THE TYPE AND USE OF PP AND THE AND UP AND HOW THAT PP ALIGN WITH RE OPENING ROADMAP. STRATEGIES AN EXISTING RESEARCH PROJECTS AND NEEDS. IN CLOSING LET ME JUST REITERATE A FEW POINTS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN RESPONDING TO COVERT NINETEEN SINCE MID TO LATE JANUARY. WHEN THE REPATRIATION EFFORTS OF US CITIZENS TOOK PLACE TO OUR STATE. THIS ALLOWED US TO ENGAGE IN ADVANCE PLANNING EFFORTS WITH LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS TO OPT TO APPROPRIATELY MANAGE THE RATE OF INFECTION. IN RELATE. THE OTHER SIX GIVEN THE POPULATION AREA AND SIZE OF CALIFORNIA. GIVEN THE ONGOING GLOBAL SHORTAGE OF PP CALIFORNIA HAS STILL BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE AND DISTRIBUTE NOW FORTY SIX MILLION AND NINETY FIVE MASS OVER THIRTY TWO MILLION SURGICAL MASKS OR PROCEDURE MASS OVER ONE MILLION GALLONS OVER FOUR MILLION FACE SHIELDS AND NEARLY SIXTEEN MILLION GLOVE SETS. ALSO INCLUSIVE CALIPHATE BOBBING ITS OWN DIRECT SUPPLY CHAIN OF PROTECTIVE MASS. FOR THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLOW FOR THE RE OPENING OF OUR STATE. WHO MAY NOT RECEIVE UTILIZE PROTECTIVE MASK ON A CONTINUAL BASIS BUT MAY REQUIRED. POST OVER NINETEEN VARMINT. GIVEN THE TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN THE STATUS OF PP ALLOCATION AND TO ENSURE FOR TRANSPARENCY WE ESTABLISHED TWO SECTIONS ON THE COVERT NINETEEN WEBSITE. DEDICATED TO PP THE FIRST SECTION CALLED COUNTY MAPS ALLOWS THE READER TO SCROLL OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTY AND SEE DATA ANALYTICS ASSOCIATE WITH COVERT NINETEEN CASES HOSPITALS AND THE QUAL CALL ONE QUANTITY OF PP BE DISTRIBUTED IN THAT COUNTY. THIS CALL PP REQUEST AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS AND IS DESIGNED TO DESCRIBE HOW TO SECURE PP FROM THE STATE'S STOCKPILE. FOR THE VARIOUS SECTORS THAT MAY. EXAMPLES OF THOSE SECTORS INCLUDE OFTEN% MEDICAL CHILD CARE SENIOR CARE AND ASSISTED LIVING AGRICULTURE FARMWORKERS SCHOOLS TRANSIT AND TRANSPORTATION GROCERS IN FOOD SERVICE AND MANUFACTURING. THIS DESCRIBES HOW TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM THE PROCESS TO ALLOW REQUEST TO OBTAIN COMMODITIES. BOB THERE'S BEEN NO MONEY THAT THE STATE HAS LOST IN ANY OF THESE EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT FOR TRANSACTIONS TODAY. THE STATE HAS NO MONEY IN ANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS OR PERFORMANCE TO DATE AND THAT HAS BEEN REQUIRED AS AN UNDERTAKING DURING THE COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE STOCK AND A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCE INCLUDE. WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FBI AND US ATTORNEY OFFICE. WITHOUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THESE COMMENTS SUCH A COMPLEX. OF VERY COMPLEX VERY ELABORATE- FAST MOVING AND DYNAMIC ASYMMETRICAL EVENT- THAT IS REALLY REQUIRED ALL HANDS ON DECK. IN A AND I CAN'T BE PROBLEM. OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE THEY HAVE DEDICATED THEMSELVES IN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER UNDER TREMENDOUS CONDITIONS WORKING LITERALLY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO BE ABLE TO SOURCE A CORNERSTONE OF OUR ABILITY TO ON AND THAT PP- OF. WITHOUT ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. DAY THANK YOU DIRECTOR FOR THE UPDATE- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION GOING TO POP. RIGHT GET MISTER PATTERSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE- OPPORTUNITY ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS- YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED THIS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. WHERE ARE WE GETTING OUR IN NINETY FIVE MASKS NOW. THE HOW MANY DO WE HAVE AND DO WE KNOW ESSENTIALLY WHERE THEY ARE. SO ON THE CAKE THE FIRST PART OF THAT WE GET OUR AND NINETY FIVE MASS CURRENTLY FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES- SOME ARE BEING SOURCED FROM- OVERSEAS ASIA MARKET- WHERE WE CAN SQUEEZE OUT. OF SMALL ORDERS OF AND NINETY FIVE OPPOSED TO THE BORDERS NOW ARE COMING OUT ARE SMALL AND WHEN I SAY SMALL I'M TALKING IN THE- LESS THAN MILLION NUMBER MORE IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME OFFER. THE MARKET IS CHANGING A LITTLE BIT WHERE WE CAN. GET ALL OF. TO BE R. THERE'S A THERE'S COMPANY IS NOW. A WORKING ON OFTEN PURPOSING AND NINETY FIVE BASS- BUT BUT EVEN. WITH BOTH IT IS A PRINCE CAN ONLY USE. AND THE ONLY PROVIDE AS WITH ARIEL. YOU WE HAVE POOREST AS PART OF OUR AGREEMENT WITH WHY THE TO SOME A HUNDRED MILLION AND NINETY FIVE SOME. OF AND THE CONTRACTORS UPON THE ABILITY TO GET THOSE MATT. IN A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF TIME FRAMES ARE AND CAN BE CANCELED AT ANY TIME WE LONGER NEED THE MATH MASKS. THE MASS WE ALSO GET. FROM FEMA FEMA HAS BEEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY COMMENTS. 30% OF THE OPERATION- BRIDGE GOES TO FEMA FOR- PURPOSING IN THE NATIONAL STOCKPILE. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET A LITTLE BIT SAID I'M TALKING LIKE IN THE ONE TO TWO MILLION. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME AS SOON AS WE GET THE P. THESE KIND OF PP. MASKS OF ALL SORTS AND TYPES. WE TURN THEM AROUND AND PUSH THEM BACK OUT BECAUSE WE ARE SO LET THE DEFICIT. IN UNFILLED NEED FOR MASKS. RIGHT NOW I THINK IN THE STOCKPILE WE HAVE- BECAUSE WE JUST GOT A BIG SHIPMENT. OF THE WHY THE SURGICAL MASKS- BY THE WAY THAT THE THAT THE TWO PARTS OF THE B. Y. DE CONTRACT. ONE WAS AND NINETY FIVE MASS. SUSTAINABLE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION UP ALIVE AND THE OTHER. WAS SURGICAL MASKS. JUST LIKE THE ONE I'M WEARING. ARE WHICH WAS A FIFTY MILLION A MONTH. THEY WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY- ACCELERATE GOES IN AND MOVE THEM TO US ALMOST TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE OF. THE EXPECTED- OF CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS WHICH ALLOWED US TO PUSH THOSE HARD INTO THE COMMUNITY. THE SUSE WE GET THE MAN WE TURN THEM AROUND. THIS WEEKEND WE PUSH POST ELEVEN MILLION MASS OUT ALL DIFFERENT SORTS OF SECTOR FROM TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOLS TO. HEALTH CARE. TO NAME IT- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT A MILLION AND NINETY FIVES SITTING IN OUR WAREHOUSE- WE'RE EXPECTING US TO SHIP ME TODAY. THE ABSENT I JUST. WITH WITH THIS PP. HOW HOW ARE YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT GOES THE- WAY THIS WORKS IS THAT. THE REQUEST FOR MADE UP THROUGH A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS. MOST OF THE REQUEST TO COME THROUGH THE MEDICAL HEALTH SYSTEM. FOR ANY NINETY FIVES IN CIRCLES WHICH ARE PREDOMINATELY USED FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. THEY GO TO THEIR MEDICAL HEALTH COORDINATOR AT THE- OPERATIONAL AREA OR COUNTY LEVEL. THEY THEN- TYPICALLY THEY HAVE ALL THE WAREHOUSE THERE'D BE TRYING TO FILL THOSE BUT IN THIS CASE IT COMES RIGHT UP TO THE STATE BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THE WAREHOUSE. AND WHAT IS YOUR HE DID EIGHT FILL OUT THE WAREHOUSE IS. DOWN TO THE- PUBLIC HEALTH. OF THE COUNTY. WITH THE PUSH THEM OUT TO THE VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT MAKE THE REQUEST. YOU CAN SEE WE'RE ALL THOSE GO BY GOING TO- THE- COUNTY MAP THAT I MENTIONED- ON THE COVERT. DOT NINETY WITH A COVER NINETEEN DOT CA DOT GOV WEBSITE. AND ALL ON THERE YOU CAN GO WITH THE COUNTY AND YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY SPECIFICALLY HOW MANY PEOPLE USE HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED OUT. OUR ONLY LEVEL. THE COUNTIES KEEP THE TRACK OF WHO'S IN NEED OF THOSE IN WHERE THESE THOSE GO- AND YOU KNOW LIKE I SAY RIGHT NOW WELL THE BIG THING IS WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE STILL IN A VERY. AND COME ON THE US. DOING MUCH BETTER ON THE SURGICAL MASK- BECAUSE THE SUSTAINABLE RELIABLE PIPELINE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE IS DELIVERED AND NOW WE'RE BEING ABLE TO PUSH THOSE OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AS WE SPEAK. THANK YOU UP RESPECTED IN NINETY FIVE. MASKS AND THE B. Y. THE CONTRACT ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THEY MAY NOT BE. A CERTIFIED AND IF THEY ARE NOT CERTIFIED IN A TIMELY FASHION TO HAVE A BACK UP PLAN FOR PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL MASKS THAT THE B. Y. DE CONTRACT FOR THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU- SO. WE WITHIN THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACT- SPECIFICALLY STATED AS A CONDITION. ALL IS THAT THE- THE VENDOR NEEDS TO PROVIDE A NYLON FDA CERTIFIED. AND NINETY FIVE MASS THAT MEANS THAT THEY- IT'S A COME UPON THEM TO OBTAIN THAT AND I'LL CERTIFICATION. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED IN MAY WE- EXPECTED THEM TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT AND NINETY FIVE- NOW CERTIFICATION IN MAY- THEY HAVE- PROVISIONAL CERTIFICATION BY MY ALSO- BUT- IN A SECONDARY PALM REVIEW BY UNDER. LABORATORY ON BEHALF OF THE FDA AND I ALSO- THE WE HAVE THEY HAVE THEY FOUND SOME PROBLEMS IN THE DOCUMENTATION. WITH REGARDS TO- THE NEED TO IN A MOVE THAT THE APPLICATION FOR ON THE SPEC SHEETS. MCCURRY BUT ACTUALLY I AM. THERE ARE THE WORKING ON THAT ACTION PLAN AND WEEKS BACK FULLY EXPECTED BE ABLE TO GET THE CERTIFICATION OF THE PRODUCT MATERIALS IN CELLS HAD ALREADY BEEN. DETERMINED BY THE OPTION OF BEING OF QUALITY AND WE'RE ASKING FOR THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND NINETY FIVE MASS THE ROAD BY THE WAY STE YOU KNOW. A VARIETY OF IT THE FILES FROM AND NINETY IS THAT RUN FROM SIXTY FIVE CENTS. TO AND NINETY FIVE THE RUN FOR THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY. IN THE MARKET. SO THERE ARE. TIMES IT AND FIVE. AND THESE ARE ONES THAT WE WERE. HI SCHOOL. CASE OF MAY NOT MEETING THE MAY REQUIRE. THAT'S WHY. THEY HAD TO IMMEDIATELY THAT TO OUR TOO I FIFTY FOUR MILLION. BACK BECAUSE THEY DID NOT MEET THAT- IF. WE DO NOT HAVE- THE SECOND. ONE FAILED- WE ARE WHERE WE ARE AT WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES. AND PERMITS WE ARE COULD TO ACTIVELY SOURCE THROUGH OUR FIRST STRATEGY PRONG STRATEGY AND THIS IS WHY WE DID A THREE PRONGED STRATEGY. JUST AS A REMINDER THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WORKING WITH NGOS AND OUR NORMAL VENDOR COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO- PROVIDED- AND NINETY FIVE THE SECOND ONE WAS THROUGH A PIPELINE SECURE PIPELINE AND THE THIRD WAS. THE PATEL UNIT WHERE WE WERE DISINFECTING- AT AND RECERTIFIED THOSE MASKS FOR USE WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH SEVERAL. HUNDRED HOSPITALS NOW I'VE- GOT. NUMBER TODAY. ARE THAT ARE% WORKING WITH BEING ABLE TO COLLECT THEIR THEIR AND NINETY FIVE RISE USE THAN NINETY FIVE MASS. AND MOVE THEM FORWARD THROUGH THE DISINFECTION PROCESS THAT WILL. THIS AFFECT UP TO EIGHTY THOUSAND A DAY BUT- ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. WE HAVE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A SLOWING STILL NOT STILL NOT COMPLETELY MET. BUT A LITTLE BIT OF A SLOWING IN THE AND NINETY FIVE REQUIREMENTS BY THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE- THE MAJOR PROVIDERS. THAT HAVE BEEN SOURCE THROUGH THE AIR BRIDGE OPERATION AIRBRIDGE ARE STARTING TO PROVIDE THAT THOSE COMMODITIES DIRECTLY THE HOSPITALS. AND DESERVE COMPANIES LIKE MCKESSON AND CARDINAL THE NORMAL COMPANIES THAT. THESE HOSPITALS ALREADY WORK WITH SO A NUMBER OF FACTORS AGAIN IN THIS IN THE MARKET SPACE. OUR OUR CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND SHIFT- WE ALSO ARE STARTING TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A DOMESTIC PRODUCTION COME AROUND- SO OUR OUR PLAN IS THAT WE WILL THEN. EVENT AND USE SOME OF THE OTHER PRONG APPROACHES WILL CONTINUE TO USE THOSE PRODUCT PURCHASE IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT- CONSECUTIVE ITS CONCURRENTLY- BUT WE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AS WE WENT FORWARD IN THE EVENT THAT WE WOULDN'T DOUBT OF THE OLD MAN- UP A- FORCED TO GET. THOSE BRAND HI YEAH AND I FIVE SEVEN ATTIC WE'RE- WE'RE COFFIN. THAT WILL BE ABLE BILLS. ONE MORE. QUESTION AT IT SAID TO PUT ARE THERE ALL. SIMILAR NO BILL TO LOOK THE NO BID IN LARGE STE. URGENCY CONTRACTS THE STATE HAS ENTERED INTO THAT WE DO NOT KNOW ABOUT OR HAVE NOT BEEN PUBLICLY DISCLOSED I BELIEVE ALL OF THE CONTRACTS THAT- THAT THAT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER HAS. ENTERED INTO HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE AND YOU KNOW- THERE COULD BE OUT THERE COULD BE A OF. THE WORK. I NOW WE ARE HAPPY CONSTANTLY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THEIR ARE BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW OF ANY LARGE- PROCUREMENTS AT THIS POINT BECAUSE- I FOR ALL THE THING IS MENTIONED. WE'VE BUILT A MUCH. EVEN LIVE. EFFORT AND AN THAT AND THE AND MARKETS OFFICE CHANGE A LITTLE BIT ONE. ATTACK AND I'M THE CHAIRS INDULGENCE. OUR THERE ARE ANY OTHER CONTRACTS WHERE THERE IS TAXPAYER MONEY- FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE- IN JEOPARDY OF NON PERFORMING CONTRACTS. I'M A LITTLE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION LITTLE. CAN YOU CLARIFY FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE WELL AGAIN YOU HAVE WE HAVE MARKED THE THESE CONTRACTS- AND YOUR MONEY IS SENT IT'S OUT THERE AND YET YOU ARE YOU HAVE CONTRACTS THAT ARE IN THE MIDST NON PERFORMED. IN THE WORDS IT COULD. NOW FEAR THAT MIGHT HAVE FAILED IS LIKE B. Y. DE. WELL CONTRACT OF COURSE HAS EIGHT EVERY VENDOR IF THE CONTRACTOR OF COURSE- IN SOME FORM OR FASHION- COULD POTENTIALLY. DELIVERY OF THEIR SERVICES- WE ARE BUILT IN THE ALL OF THE CONTRACTS OF REQUIREMENTS- FOR IMMEDIATE TERMINATION. AND OUTSIDE OF ONLY A COUPLE OF CONTRACTS. AND REALLY IT'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF CONTRACTS THAT WE ACTUALLY MOVE MONEY FORWARD ALL THE MONEY THAT HAS ALL THE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN AND WE'VE ENTERED INTO HAVE ALL BEEN A PAY WHEN SEVE MILITARY SO WE INSPECT. MADE THE LIST- THEY MEET EVERY REQUIREMENTS AND IT'S THE NEXT FORTY FIVE DAYS OR US LIKE THAT THAT THAT THAT WE HAVEN'T PLAYED THAT THROUGH THE NORMAL PERFORMER PROFITS THAT WE WERE. IT WAS ONLY A- VERY. HE'S VERY LARGE COUPLE THESE LARGE- CONTRACTS THAT WERE NECESSARY TO MOVE FORWARD EARLY ON- THAT WE ACTUALLY MOVED- MONEY FOR WORK AND- AND AS A SAID- THE- THE ACTUAL MONEY- ONLY MONEY THAT ACTUALLY EXCHANGED INTO- THE- WHERE WE'RE GETTING A PRODUCT BACK- THAT WE HAVE NOT CANCEL OR- DIDN'T YOU MONEY IS THE BE WAITING. I'M FINISHED I PUSH IT A MARK WANT TO SAY PERSONAL YOU KNOW SOME OF US REMEMBERS. A WHO SERVE ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALSO ON THE- AUDIT COMMITTEE AND ALL WE HAVE HAD SOME. LOCAL CONCERNS ABOUT- DIVISIONS DEPARTMENTS IT'S AFTER WITH WITH IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I PERSONALLY APPRECIATE VERY VERY MUCH WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. AND YOU HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE VERY HELPFUL WITH RESPECT TO DISTRICT IN THE PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS WE PASS ALONG YOUR YOUR STAFF VERY QUICK TO RESPOND. AND WE DO A VERY VERY GOOD JOB I NEXT THE WIND. AND I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH MARK THANK YOU FOR. MY OUT. MEDINA YEAH. THANK YOU. THIS HERE TODAY I REPRESENT OF THE SIXTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES MARINO VALLEY WE'RE MARCH AIR FORCE BASE IS LOCATED. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND I AM VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE SITUATION REGARDING- THE PROTECTIVE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HAS GOTTEN BETTER. IN THE IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS. OF THE STATE AT HOME ORDERS THE INLAND EMPIRE. SPECIFICALLY RIVERSIDE COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY ON. ON MARCH TWENTY FOURTH HAD ASKED FOR MASS AND THE ADMINISTRATION POINTED OUT THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND MASS WHEN IN REALITY RIVERSIDE COUNTY ONLY RECEIVED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MASS OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE. THOUSAND THE MINISTRY SAID RECEIVE- THE MEMBER OF THE INLAND EMPIRE CAUCUS I KNOW THAT. WITH THE SITUATION THAT RIVERSIDE COUNTY FACE WAS NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AS WELL. SO I I'D I'D LIKE TO HEAR IF YOU WOULD. WHAT WERE THE CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO GET. THE EQUIPMENT BUT WHAT WERE THE CHALLENGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE- RECEIVE SOMEONE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE INLAND EMPIRE WE'RE NOT. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT. CONCEIVABLY ALL IT COULD BE TRUE AND I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS IN FRONT OF ME FOR THAT CASE BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT. WE. WE COLLECTIVELY ALL OF US HERE. DEAL WITH PRETTY EXTENSIVE DISASTER OPERATIONS EVERY YEAR IT'S ALWAYS A ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT EFFORT THE LEGISLATURE WAS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALL WORKING TOGETHER. TYPICALLY WE'VE GOT TRIED AND TRUE. SYSTEMS THAT WE USE PARTICULAR IN THE AREA OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION AND DISTRIBUTION RESOURCE ALLOCATION. TYPICALLY WE DO UP WHERE WE'VE GOT EVEN YOU KNOW A REGIONAL DISASTER MAYBE IT'S SEVERAL COUNTIES. IN THIS ONE HOWEVER. WE HAD ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES EVERY CITY IN THOSE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES EVERY SECTOR WITHIN THOSE CITIES IN THOSE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES DEMANDING. AP UP IN A IN A IN A IN A FORMAT WHERE WE HAD VERY LIMITED AMOUNTS TO GO AROUND CONCEIVABLY IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT THEY MADE THE ORDER OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE WE DELIVERED IT MAYBE WE DID WE COURSE CORRECTED I DO KNOW THAT IN THE CASE OF RIVERSIDE AT THE SAME TIME WE WERE ACTIVELY TRYING TO MOVE TO FIELD HOSPITALS INTO THE REGION INTO INTO RIVERSIDE COUNTY SPECIFICALLY- THERE WAS A LOT OF COMMODITY MOVEMENT GOING IN THE RIVER SIDE. AND I WILL JUST BE THE CA THE BAND YOU KNOW OF THESE BIG AS ON AND IT WASN'T FROM OF THEM PURPOSE THAT. COULD BE BACK IN TELL YOU WE PUSHED A LOT IN A RIVER CAL. OBVIOUSLY UPON WHAT THE NEED ARE HOWEVER. ON BALANCE LET ME JUST SAY. UNDER AND AGAIN I NEED TO LOOK AT THIS CASE SPECIFICALLY BUT UNDER THESE KIND OF CONDITIONS. THERE ARE MANY JURISDICTIONS THAT REQUESTED QUITE A BIT. BUT BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY REASONS WE HAD THE TRIAGE AND PRIORITIZE. WHO WAS GOING TO GET STUFF AND WHO WAS IT. SO I I'VE I'VE I'VE I GUESS I WAS THEM APOLOGIZE IF THERE IS IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE THAT. DIDN'T WORK QUITE RIGHT BUT I WILL LOOK INTO AND I ASSURE YOU. THAT IT WASN'T DONE IN A IN A IN A FORM OF. PURPOSELY NOT PROVIDING IT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND- YEAH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ARE PART OF THE STATE. WAS AND- RECEIVING- THE EQUIPMENT WHEN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE'S WORK SO THANK YOU. WELCOME. YOU'RE GONNA AFTER QUESTIONS OF THEM ALL RIGHT OKAY. THEN I'VE GOT A I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO- CAN GOING FROM THE MOST IS SPECIFIC TO. MORE BRIDES AND SO I THINK I LIKE EVERYONE HERE I'M VERY RELIEVED TO HEAR YOUR AFFIRMATION THAT NO TAXPAYER DOLLARS HAVE BEEN LOST AND- THE X. AT THE CONTROLS THAT EXIST HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE. AS YOU SAID BLUE FLAME THAT WITH A CAUTIONARY. IT SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- FOR A CONTRACT OF THAT SIZE NOW WHO IS THE SITE SIGNATORY WHO WOULD BE THE SIGNING AUTHORITY ON A CONTRACTOR THAT SIZE SO TYPICALLY- YOU KNOW WE DELEGATE UNDER WHAT WE WHAT WE USE IN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY PLAN IS UP- COLUBER SUPPORT FUNCTION EIGHTEEN OF THEM DIFFERENT AGENCIES ARE MEN'S HAVE THE PROPER. SPELLING FOR MEETING THE RECALL. IN THIS IT'S ESF SEVEN WHICH IS RESOURCE IN COMMODITY MANAGEMENT. THE FORTY REST WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE THAT- YOU KNOW THE DIRECTOR OR HIS DESIGNATE OR DOES IT ME- CLEARLY VALVE THAT SAID- AND IN A WAY THAT GOES IT. DEPENDS ON ON WHERE THE RAT IF INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM IT'S IN THE FIELD THEY MAY BE DELEGATED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF A FORTY STEP TO PROCURE. OF THESE BIG BIG CONTRACTS THOUGH- AND IT WAS ONLY A FEW OF THEM IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE EVEN IS AS COMPLEX THIS WAS. ALL- DISCUSSED- WITH ME AND- WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE GS- AND WITH A PARTNER WITH THE SECOND OF OUR GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS WITH THE WITH THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. DIRECTORS THE PAGE BECAUSE THESE WERE ALL THREE MEDICALLY NECESSARY DEVICES AND SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL SET. AT LEAST IN THE OF B. E. R. THE AGREEMENT IT WAS. A ONE OF YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT THAT WAS ALL COME THAT WAS ME THE ONES WERE DONE WITHIN THE PRO AND IN THE CASE OF THE CASE REBEL FLAME. I'VE WAS TO THE DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT L. SERVICES. PACKAGE AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME RELUCTANCE WHICH THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS EXPLAINED ABOUT THAT THE WILLINGNESS IN THERE THE REASONS. FOR THE RESIDENTS TO RELEASE SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS AROUND PP. I THINK I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY RESPONDING TO MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION YOU SAID NOW ALL OF THE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC AND HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH THE LEGISLATURE. CORRECT I. AS THE MY KNOWLEDGE. CAN I WANT PARKING FOR ONE THING THEM. THERE WAS ONLY ONE CONTRACT BILL THAT WE SPECIFICALLY WANT TO HOLD ON RELEASED. FOR THE REASON. THAT I SORT OF MY BEFORE BUT THIS WAS BE ID CONTRA AND IT HAD TO DO PREDOMINATELY WITH. IT WAS SUCH A CRITICAL. CRITICAL LOOK PIPELINE OF ASSETS TO US. WE HAD- A CASE WHERE WE SPECIFICALLY WENT TO A CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WE APPROACH THEM WE COULD REACH OUT AND- AND LITERALLY TOUCH THEM WHICH WAS AN IMPORTANT. PIECE IN OUR VETTING- BE HAVE A MASSIVE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY IN CHINA AND THAT THEY WERE ALREADY RE PURPOSING. TO BUILD OUT AND THEY WERE WAY AHEAD OF THE GAME. ALL THE BILL ABOUT PP AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIALS LET ME BE CLEAR. THESE SURGICAL MASKS. ANYBODY CAN MAKE FOR THE MOST PART- TO THE DEGREE AND NINETY FIVE REQUIRE A CERTAIN TYPE OF MATERIAL A CERTAIN KIND OF THING THAT FILTERS SURGICALLY REQUIRED MASKS ONLY OF A COUPLE PLACES IN THE WORLD YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET THE MATERIALS AND SO EIGHT HI ONE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAD A PIPE ONE OF THOSE COURSES. SO YES THIS AGREEMENT WE STARTED WORKING ALL OF THE BILL THIS WHAT WE FELT WAS JUST REALLY A GREAT CONTRACT AND TO BE ABLE TO. SUSTAIN THIS MATERIAL. TO BACK THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT- LAW N. B. Y. B. OF WAS BEING BESIEGED BY NOT ONLY A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES. EMBASSIES BY A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND WE DIDN'T KNOW QUITE FRANKLY EXACTLY HOW MUCH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAD PROMISED TO LIKE BRAZIL AND FRANCE ITALY AND ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES ABOUT GIVING PP WE KNEW THAT CHINA WAS BREAKING DOWN AND STOPPING. MANUFACTURING IN THEIR COUNTRY WE KNEW THAT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK IN ONE HAD ONLY DECIMATED THE THEIR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE COULD GO TO WORK. THERE'S ALL THESE COUNTRIES ALL THE STUFF THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PROMISED AND THEN HERE COMES CALIFORNIA. COMES AROUND THE SIDE CORNER HERE ON A SIDE TACKLE AND SETS UP THIS. CONTRACT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION MASKED A MONTH. AND THAT WAS- ARE CONCERNED THAT IT WOULD BE INTERRED WIEN OR SHUT DOWN- IF WE PROVIDED TOO MUCH OF A INFORMATION. OUR INTENTION WAS ALWAYS TO RELEASE THE CONTRACT WITH A VERY OFTEN IN THE CONTRACT. BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS FROM SECURITY SPECTER WE JUST WANTED TO WAIT. AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT BECAME YOU KNOW I'M A BIG DEAL- AND- AND- AT IN IN THE END ONCE THE MASK STARTED ROLLING IN- AND WE KNEW THAT THE PIPELINE WAS. SUFFICIENT WE KNEW THAT- WE CANGET IT THROUGH CUSTOMS WE KNEW THAT THE PLANES WOULD WORK WE KNEW ALL THAT STUFF WOULD HAPPEN. WE FEEL COMFORTABLE AND REALLY SEE THAT THE CONTRACT ALL THE REST OF THEM HOWEVER. WERE WELL I THINK WE'RE JUST READ IT THERE WAS NO PROVISION OF US HOLDINGANY OF THOSE BACK. UNDER SAID THAT HELPS IT YES. ALSO IN THIS CHALLENGE IS GO TO BE WITH US FOR SOME TIME TO CALM. AND THE BILL LIKE KNOWLEDGE THAT A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF PP IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO BEING ABLE TO RE OPEN THE STATE AND IS A KIND OF ME. YOU SPOKE. A BUNCH ABOUT THE WORK BEEN DONE TO SOURCE SUPPLIERS. ON WHAT IF ANYTHING HAVE WE DONE TO TRY TO ENROLL SOME OF OUR GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. TO TRY TO PAY THAT DOT TO MANUFACTURING PARTICULARLY THAT THE AND NINETY FIVE MASKS THAT ARE SO CRITICAL IN IN SUCH SUPPLY. YEAH HOUSE THERE'S A COMPANY THAT. THIS IS AGAIN EVEN EVEN THE COMPANIES AND NINETY- THREE AM WHICH IS THE- WHICH WHICH WE ALL KNOW HEARD ABOUT THERE ARE STILL HAVING TROUBLE SOURCING MATERIALS AND BEING ABLE TO DELIVER IN LARGE QUANTITIES. PLUS IN THEIR CASE- THEY HAVE- MAKE COMMITMENTS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FIRST AND FOREMOST. OF WHICH IS BEEN CHALLENGING FOR US BUT EVEN HONEYWELL AND THEN THE COMPANY IN ARIZONA. VERY SMALL QUANTITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA- I WANT TO GET MY LIST HERE BECAUSE- THERE IS ONE COMPANY- CALLED THE- AND VOIGTS. AD BOOK. IT'S A- RETAIL DISPLAY COMPANY SINCE SANTA CLARA LAW AND IT IS BEING RETOOLED- TO PRODUCE ANY NINE AND NINETY FIVE MASKS SB DO HAVE- YOU HAVE A STANDING PO WITH US IF THEY CAN GET AND I ARE. IN WHICH THEY'VE APPLIED YOU AND THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS THEY'VE GOT A STEAMY PO WITH US AS SOON AS THEY GET THAT NOT ARE STRICTLY XIN WILL BE FIRST IN LINE TO BE TO GET. I'M SO. WE'RE OUT. JUST LIKE YOU KNOW. THE FOLKS AT OAKLEY WHO LITERALLY OR MAKING SUNGLASSES AND NOW THEY'RE MAKING FACE SHIELDS AND WE MERELY THE P. OVER THAT WITH THEM AND WE'RE GETTING- YOU KNOW MILLIONS OFFICIALS FROM THEMSELVES WHERE WE CAN HOW CALIFORNIA SO INNOVATIVE OF COURSE WE HAVE SUCH GREAT CAPABILITY- USING OUR BY ATTACK- KELLY I JUST RECENTLY CAME UP WITH RESERVE AARON AND- POTENTIAL MEDICATION. FOR KOBE BABY KNOW DONE HEARING. WE'VE BEEN WORK VERY CLOSE WITH THEM- AND THIS IS UP AND DOWN THE STATE THE GOVERNOR DID BRING TOGETHER. A CONSORTIUM OF. BUSINESS LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS WE'VE GOT WEB PORTALS ARE OFFICE OF NON GOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR COURTNEY HAS BEEN BEING OUT ALL THESE FOLKS. AND WE'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF ALL IDEAS AND- I COULD BE HAPPY SHOULD SHARE WITH YOU THE LIST OF ALL THE COMPANIES HAVE COME TOGETHER. AND TRY TO LEVER THEM IS. WONDER I WOULD BE USED ALL OF. AN ONE LAST QUESTION SO GIVEN JUSTICE AND SCALE OF THE TOWN THAT WE'VE ALL. EXPERIENCED AND THAT WE ANTICIPATE GOING FORWARD. DO YOU THINK CALIFORNIA NEEDS A DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT. SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND RIGHT NOW UNDER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT THE GOVERNOR CERTAINLY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO. IMPLEMENT AND EQUIVALENT TO DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT AS THE CALL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE DID TALK ABOUT DOING A TO BRING SUCH IN THE GOVERNOR. WHEN WE BOB WE WERE CLOSE TO HAVING THAT DONE BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WHEN THE GOVERNOR REACHED OUT. AND WE FRAWLEY'S BUSINESS LEADERS TOGETHER AND WE WHEN HE WHEN HE WENT ON PRESS CONFERENCE AND TALKED ABOUT. COMPANIES BRING OUT. WE WERE JUST ON WITH THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST AND SO WE JUST DIDN'T THINK WE NEEDED TO ACTUALLY FORMALIZE. STOPPING THAT WE WERE ALREADY GETTING- THROUGH THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS. OF TO BE CLEAR THOSE WE DO HAVE UNDER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT- UNDER THAT THAT A FORTY YOU HAVE GRANTED US WEEK YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR CAN. IMPLEMENT THAT. YOU KNOW AS NECESSARY OKAY UNDERSTOOD AND AS WE LOOK FORWARD WHO IS GOING WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR KIND OF LEADING THIS PP CHARGES THAT STILL CAN RESIDE IN IN YOUR DEPARTMENT IN YOUR AUTHORITY OR IS THERE A TASK FORCE THAT BY THE GOING TO BE SET UP FOR HAS BEEN SET UP TO TRY TO REALLY FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE. WELL WE DO THANKS FOR THE QUESTION WE ARE. WHEN WE DEAL WITH THESE BIG EMERGENCIES WE KIND OF BREAK- THE VARIOUS ASPECTS THAT HAVE RESPONSIBILITY INTO- TASK FORCES LIKE SCHOOLS TASK FORCE OR- RECOVERY TASK FORCE. FOR TRANSPORTATION. IN THIS THE WE DID HAVE A- PP- INTERNAL PP TASK FORCE IT WAS REALLY. IT IS WHAT THAT YES HAVE SEVEN AS I MENTIONED AND SHE SUPPORTS FUNCTIONS SEVEN. REALLY DOES. BUT WE ADDED A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL ENTITY SO WE BROUGHT IN. WITH THE GAS IT WE ASK IT WAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES. IT WILL. CAL. FEE BY THE F. B. IS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES THERE GOV OPS. WE CAME IN AND BUILT AROUND TO MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ICE I'VE LISTED IN MY TESTIMONY. THAT ENTITY WILL REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL. THIS IS PASSED AND TO YOUR POINT THIS IS SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE ONGOING FOR. YOU KNOW AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR- TO THE LEVEL AND THE GREED OF ENGAGEMENT WILL DEPEND ON MUCH WE CAN GET. PP OUT WE HAVE A WE ASK THE GENERAL WAY WE DO THINGS IN STATE STATE OPERATIONS DURING EMERGENCIES IS WE FILL THE GAPS SO REALLY. WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON BUILDING AND FILLING THE GAP ON THE FRONT END WHERE- YOU CAN'T GET THE COMMODITIES THROUGH THE NORMAL. PROCESS EVENTUALLY THE NORMAL PROCESS WILL STABILIZE AND WE WOULD EXPECT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS TO START PROCURING THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS INSTEAD OF HAVING THE STATE'S. TO THEMSELVES WHEN THAT HAPPENS- NOT REALLY WE'RE NOT REALLY THERE YET I COULD TELL YOU PROBABLY BE ANOTHER FEW WEEKS BEFORE WE CAN GET TO THAT POINT. OKAY UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM OTHER MEMBERS SO AB WE'RE GONNA LET THE DIRECTOR GO SO IF THERE'S QUESTIONS YOU HAVE FOR THE DOCTOR WE SHOULD ASK HIM DOWN BECAUSE THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR OTHER PANELISTS. MISTER KAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AS I SAID I WAS GOING TO GO AHEAD LISTEN ALL THE PANELISTS BEFORE- PUT THE QUESTION BUT IF THE DIRECTOR IS GOING TO GET BACK TO WORK CERTAINLY- ONE ALLOW HIM TO DO THAT. JUDGE KURDISH DOES SEE A THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED EFFORTS AND ALL THE HARD WORK. THE FOLKS OVER CALLOW YES- OR DOING. I WANT TO. DIVE INTO FOR A SECOND TO KINDA LASSES WORDS I HEARD YOU SAY YOU KNOW THEIR LESSONS LEARNED SOME IS REALLY CONTRACTS AS I SAID MY OPENING STATEMENT. I THINK- IT'S EASY TO BE A MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK. IN THE SENSE OF- LAYING BLAME AT FOLKS DOORSTEPS- THE REALITIES PEOPLE'S LIVES ON THE LINE- THE GOVERNOR-FOLKS. IN YOUR DEPARTMENT HEAD THAT QUICKLY- TO MAKE SURE WE CAN SECURE THE SUPPLIES AND CERTAINLY. CERTAIN MODERATE APPROPRIATE. ENACTED PLEA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY- BUT CERTAINLY THE- BLUE FLAME IS THE KIND OF STICKS OUT AS- SOME REAL ODD STUFF THERE COULD YOU WALK ME THROUGH CONVALESCENCE LEARNED- HOW WERE. YOUR WHAT WHAT PRECAUTIONS ARE IN PLACE NOW AND ONE THAT COMES TO MIND IS LIKE YOU KNOW WHO IS AUTHORIZED I KNOW YOU SAID THE AGENCY HAD SCREWED. THE CONTRACTS WE- HAVE WE LIMITED THAT POOL A GREAT DEAL GOING FORWARD. I DON'T I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZES LIMITING THE POOL I THINK THAT WE WHEN WE GET IN THESE LARGE- CONTRACTS- THERE'S A LOT OF COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO FORWARD WITH THESE ARE NOT- IN REAL TIME OF- THERE'S SO MUCH HAPPENING- NOW UP IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT- WE'RE WAS LITERALLY- YOU KNOW WE WERE HAVING A CASE WHERE. YOU KNOW WE WOULD GET OPPORTUNITY ARE AND THEN MINUTES THAT OPPORTUNITY WAS LOST. HI IT WAS CHALLENGING FOR ALL OF US EVEN SEASONED- AND LOGISTICS SPECIALISTS AND EMERGING MEASURE PERSONNEL. TO BE ABLE TO- ADEQUATELY MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE LARGER DOT IN THE TEACHER CROSSES MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY COULD B DOING THAT IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WE WERE HAVING STREAM ONLY. EXTREMELY STRESSFUL ON THE PART OF EVERYBODY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING. IT'S NOT USUAL. FOR YOU KNOW EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACTS TO BE PUSHED THROUGH MAY IN THESE BIG EVENTS EXCEPT WE HAVE A BIG EARTHQUAKE. OR THE IN THE IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES AND DURING THE CAMPFIRE WE WERE WE ARE MOVING TO SOME PRETTY BIG STUFF THROUGH THE DEBRIS OPERATIONS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WERE SIGNIFICANTLY. A SIGNIFICANT- SO WE TAKE A LOT OF THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION INCLUDING. THE ABILITY TO. GET REIMBURSED AND BY THE WAY I DID MENTION MY TESTIMONY BUT- ONE THING WE MAKE SURE OF AS WE MOVE FORWARD WELL WE DON'T MAKE SURE OF IT IS ONE OF THOSE FACTORS BECAUSE IF THE IF THE NEED IS THERE. TO GET AN EMERGENCY COMMODITY THEN WE NEED TO DO IT YOUR REGARDLESS OF THE THREE A PERSON OR NOT. BUT IN ALMOST ALL THESE CASES IN REALLY 100% OF THESE CASES. THE ROLE REIMBURSABLE BY FEMA UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. SO EVERY CONTRACT THAT WE PUT FORWARD WILL BE REIMBURSED- FEW ELIGIBILITY BY FEMA AT 75% WE A HUNDRED PERCENT. FOR THAT WE CALL EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE MEASURES THAT'S ALL THE FRONT AND STUFF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT WE HEAR SOMETHING BACK SOON- ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN GET THAT I'M WE'RE HEARING MAYBE COULD BE 90% BUT UNTIL THEN WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT TO PROCLAIM THE STATE AND A NATIONAL DISASTER MAJOR DISASTER. IT WAS 475% REIMBURSEMENT. SO WE COLLECTIVELY LOOK AT ALL OF THESE THINGS WERE MOVING FORWARD AND IN THE CASE OF BLUE FLAME. ARM THE VERY THAT WAS DONE WAS DONE- AND- AND TO THE BEST OF THE DEGREE POSSIBLE IN THE TIME FRAMES THAT THEY- HAD WORKING AND- ONE OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES OF COURSE LIKE ANY CONTRACT THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH. IS IN OUR COLLABORATION WITH THE BANK WE TYPICALLY IN STATE SERVICE DON'T WIRE MONEY. AT THE TI BEFORE WE DON'T WIRE MONEY OR THE PERIOD BUT THE WIRE MONTY TO HAVE TO THE PRIOR TO GETTING A COMMODITY. IS REALLY NOT IN THE NORMAL PROCESS AND SO. THE CONDITIONS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DICTATING. ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT QUE AND WE DID NOT HAVE TO DO THAT ALL OF THESE CASES. IN MANY CASES WE FELT LIKE YOU KNOW WE'VE ADDED THEM THROUGH AND- THE PERSON WAS EITHER TO SHADY OR- IT JUST DID NOT SEEM LIKE THEY COULD DELIVER. IN THE CASE OF BLUE FLAME ON AS I MENTIONED ALL THE THINGS I SPECIFICALLY RIGHT READ THROUGH. ALL WE FELT LIKE THERE WAS NO DEROGATORY WE'VE GONE THROUGH THAT PROCESS. EVEN TO THE POINT EVEN TALKING TO THREE AM TO TRY TO GO A DIFFERENT ROUTE THE LAST MONTH MINUTE. BUT KNOWING FULL WELL THAT WE WERE IN DESPERATE NEED OF AND NINETY FIVE. WE OPTED TO MOVE FOR WITH IT. AND ONE OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCE THE CAUGHT IT WAS- THE BANK- WHO RECOGNIZE THAT- THAT THAT- THERE WAS A PROBLEM. THE BANK THEN NOTIFY BOTH. THE TREASURER AND ARE OFF I AND THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES. ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WHICH POINT. YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT WAS STOPPED AND WE PULL BACK AND- YOU KNOW THE REST IS HISTORY BEING GO THAT ROUTE SO. RIGHT WE TRY TO PUT MORE YOU KNOW WE TO IN REAL TIME. EXPANDED WE- ADDED- FROM THAT POINT- WE ADDED UP UP AND ELEMENT THAT WE TYPICALLY DON'T DO DURING DISASTER CONTRACTING OR REALLY ANY CONTRACTED FOR THAT MATTER. AND THAT IS WE BROUGHT IN THIS THIS TEAM IS LAW ENFORCEMENT TEAM OR ONE OF THE ROLES OF YES OF COURSE WE ARE ALSO THE- HOMELAND SECURITY AGENCY FOR THE STATE AND SO WE LEVERAGED ALL OF THE- ABILITY TO DO- TO USE THOSE. THOSE METHODS AND SERVICES RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US ATTORNEY U. S. ATTORNEY AT THE SAME TIME SINCE THERE WAS WIDESPREAD FRAUD GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY- THE US ATTORNEY OFFICES AROUND THE UNITED STATES OPEN UP TASK FORCES ON ON FRAUD. AND ONE HERE IN SACRAMENTO I TALK TO THE US ATTORNEY COUPLE OF TIMES- IMMEDIATELY OFFERED- TO PARTICIPATE WITH US AS WELL AS THE FBI OFFICES SACRAMENTO AND THAT WAS ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE PUT IN. OUGHT TO VET EIGHT EACH ONE OF THESE THAN BEING FORWARD. IN THIS THIS OUT. THANK YOU AND- JUST PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR THE MEMBERS HERE IN THE PUBLIC- HOW MANY NO BID CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN ENTERED TO ENTER INTO- IN RESPONSE. TO THE CRISIS. AND OKAY ON WHAT WHAT WHAT THOSE CONTRACTS WORTH COLLECTIVELY AND WE CAN GET A GENERAL NUMBER THAT I DON'T NEED YOU TO PUT IT DOWN EXACTLY. THE SERMON I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT I DO HAVE I THINK ON LINE- I HAVE- EDGES SHELL FROM OUR DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. ANGELA DO YOU POSSIBLY KNOW THAT ANSWER. ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME I CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU OKAY- SO WE HAVE ENTERED INTO- APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY- PURCHASE ORDERS- ON BEHALF OF THE- GP EFFORT- AT APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. ZACH NCLUDE THE B. Y. B. CONTRACT. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FULL VALUE OF THE B. Y. DE CONTRACT NO. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. MY FINAL QUESTION- AT THIS TIME-DIRECTOR AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO COVER SOME OF THIS. THE WARRANT PAYMENT PROCESS THANK YOU TO TREASURES GONNA WALK US THROUGH AT LEAST IN A PACKAGE HERE FOR THE MEMBERS TO TAKE A LOOK AT- CERTAINLY WORKS TO THE AGENCY HAD TO THE CONTROLLER TO THE TREASURE SO IT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT'S A FAIRLY ROBUST- WITH SAFETY- VALVE SO TO SPEAK. ARE THERE LESSONS LEARNED WHERE YOU THINK THE STRUCTURE OF THAT PROCESS. NEEDS ADDITIONAL STEPS OR ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THESE KIND OF OUT LIARS- THAT WE EXPERIENCED. SUCH AS BLUE FRAME OR FOR OTHERS. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS AND I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW. I WOULD SAY THAT. THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR OUR REVIEW AND- AFTER ACTION- ON EVERYONE OF THESE DISASTERS THEY GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT. ON HEALTH THINGS COULD HAVE OPERATED DIFFERENTLY OR BETTER. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE'S NO. LINEAR PATHWAY AND IN THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT IS REALLY THE CASE I MEAN THIS WAS ABOUT AS A SYMMETRICAL IN MANY WAYS AS THEY GET IN THE IMPACT. THAT SAID I THINK THAT- THESE WERE ALL LIARS- THAT THE SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN TRIED AND TRUE AND WE'VE USED IN MANY MANY MANY MANY DISASTERS- WORKS WELL- AND- I THINK THAT- EVERY HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS AND YOU HAVE A PANDEMIC HEY WE OUGHT TO DO A LITTLE EXTRACTION BUT- I THINK THAT- THERE WILL BE NO CERTAINLY I READ LIKE THE VETTING- THE ENHANCED VETTING EVERY PUT IN PLACE WHERE MAYBE WE'VE GOT A- WE'VE THAT- CONTRACTS OVER STRAIGHTENED OUT WITH THAT THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP- OF WHEAT WE EXPAND OUR USE UTILIZED BETTER SCHOOLS MORE TOOLS. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT UP BUT ALL THAT SAID I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE. ARE I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN THOUSAND. OR SO CONTRACTS. AND VENDORS AND THINGS THAT WE DEALT WITH AND- REALLY THERE'S BEEN- A COUPLE ABOUT LIARS THAT- YOU KNOW WE CAUGHT. THEY WERE CAUGHT AND- NOBODY WAS LOST IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT- THERE'S NOT ALWAYS ROOM FOR REFLECTION. WELL YEAH I THINK THAT'S FAIR ANSWER- DIRECTOR NOW I WOULD SAY. HOT BY THE BANK AFTER WE'VE GONE THROUGH SEVERAL GOVERNMENT STEPS I THINK LEAVES US ALL WITH THE QUESTION MAYBE THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE ON OUR PART IN OUR PROCESS- ARE YOU. AWARE OF- ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF WHAT WE'VE ALL READ THE NEWS AS IT RELATES TO MICHAEL AND JOHN THOMAS OR WHO THEY ARE OR WHAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP- IS A RELATION TO THE- SECRETARY. THIRTY EXPLANATION OF HOW WE GOT THAT FAR ALONG WITH THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS HI I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS ARE WHAT'S THE NAME. WHAT I HAVE IS MIKE COOL- IN JOHN THOMAS LIVE ALSO MORE AWARE OF WHO THEY ARE NEVER HEARD OF THEM BUT WANTED TO ASK THE QUESTION. NO NO CAN I JUST SAY BACK STEP BACK A SECOND AND SAY THAT PART OF THE PROCESS. YEAH YOU KNOW AND IT'S NOT ALL ON THE BANK BUT PART OF OUR OVERALL PROCESS INCLUDES THE BANK. SO WHAT IS NOT LINEAR WE ALL ARE YOU KNOW IF WE'RE WON T. ONE FIGHT ON THIS THEIR- ROLE LOOKING AT THIS AND- AGAIN I THINK CONTEXT. PLEASE INTO A LOT OF THE SITUATIONS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IN THE IN THE CASE IN CASE OF BLUE FLAME. HEY IT WAS CONTACTS AND IT WAS IN BASED UPON EVERYTHING THAT SEEM TO BE- LEGITIMATE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE TIME FRAMES THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH. I THINK THAT'S FAIR POINT AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE LATER TODAY MEMBERS FROM- THE TREASURER- AND PERHAPS THE CONTROLLER ARE WE HERE FOR THE CONTROLLER MENTION. WE'RE NOT WELL MAYBE FOR FOLLOW UP HERE AND THERE. ARE WILL TAKE IF YOU TRIED WRETCH APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR WORK AND PLEASE PASS ON OUR GRATITUDE TO THOSE UNIFORM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Q. THANK YOU AGAIN DOCTOR FOR JOINING US AND- WE APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU WERE DOING TO HELP US NAVIGATE THIS THIS CRISIS THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO- OUR SECOND PANELIST WHO IS. GOING TO BE TREASURER MAMA ON THAT THE VIDEO ON THE VIDEO BEHIND US. I CAN USE YES YOU SEE ME. YES WE CAN SEE YOU THANK YOU TREASURER Mà FOR JOINING US RATES. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING EVERYONE FOR SHELTERING AT HOME AND THOSE WHO ARE WORKING IN A SENSUAL SERVICES. DURING THESE TRYING TIMES ARE YOU ARE KEEPING US ALL SAFE IN MAKING IT ALL WORK. PERSONALLY I HAVE FELT THE IMPACT OF THE CRISIS BOTH AT WORK AT THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. AS WELL AS HOME SINCE MY HUSBAND IS A FIREFIGHTER. AND FIRST RESPONDER. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING THIS HAS BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED. LEARNING MOMENTS FOR HAS USE THAT METAL CHAIR A CAUTIONARY TALE. BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS IS A SUCCESS STORY IN THAT WE HAVE NOT LOST ANY TAXPAYER MONEY AS DIRECTOR GILDER DG MENTIONED A NUMBER OF TIMES. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO INTRODUCE MY OFFICE AND WHAT WE DO. I AM YOUR STATE TREASURER YOUR BANKER AS PRESCRIBED IN OUR CONSTITUTION IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE. I OVERSEE THREE DIVISIONS CHAIR SIXTEEN BOARDS COMMISSIONS AND AUTHORITIES IN MINISTER ALL OUTSTANDING BOND COMMITTEES. IN M. A VOTING MEMBER OF ABOUT A DOZEN OTHER FINANCIAL BOARDS. OVER TWO TRILLION DOLLARS COMES THROUGH OUR OFFICE EVERY YEAR. PRESENTLY WE ARE MANAGING A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS FOR THE STATE ITSELF AND MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. MY OFFICE ALSO OVERSEES THE SALE OF STATE BONDS AND ACTIVELY MANAGES ABOUT NINETY BILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSTANDING BONDS. WE ARE A SMALL BUT MIGHTY TEAM OF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY PROFESSIONALS AT THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. OVERALL I AM INCREDIBLY PROUD OF HOW OUR STATE GOVERNMENT IS HANDLING THIS CRISIS AND IN PARTICULAR MY TEAM AT THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS MUST KNOW THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TOWARD KEEPING US SAFE. PROTECTING THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. AND FUNCTIONING AS NORMALLY AS POSSIBLE UNDER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. TODAY'S FOCUS IS ON MY CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION. THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE DOZEN PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN THIS DIVISION. SINCE I STARTED AS TREASURER ON JANUARY SEVENTH TWENTY NINETEEN. I HAVE FOUND THIS DIVISION TO BE HARDWORKING. ETHICAL HIGH FUNCTIONING PROFESSIONALS DEDICATED TO SAFEGUARDING THE STATE'S ASSETS FIRST AND FOREMOST. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE DIRECTOR AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WHO ARE BOTH WITH ME TODAY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. FIRST I HAVE MORE CAREER RE. DIVISION DIRECTOR HE IS A VETERAN OF THE STATE CHARGES OFFICE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY TWO YEARS OF STATE SERVICE. ANDRES RIVERA DEPUTY DIRECTOR IS ALSO A VETERAN FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL WITH MORE THAN TWENTY TWO YEARS OF STATE SERVICE. AS ACCOUNTANTS MYSELF INCLUDED OUR JOB IS TO TAKE ANTI. EVERY DAY WE BALANCE ALL OF THE STATE'S MAJORS ACCOUNTS. ALSO IN SHORT THAT THERE ARE ADEQUATE ADEQUATE CONTROLS ON PAYMENTS FROM THE STATE TREASURY. FOR EXAMPLE FOR DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS NEED TO APPROVE A WIRE TRANSFER BEFORE IT IS RELEASED. IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE OUR FOREFATHERS ESTABLISHED IN OUR CONSTITUTION A SEPARATION OF DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THE GOVERNOR THE TREASURE IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER ARE ALL INDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE THE FUNCTIONS ARE DIFFERENT FOR EACH OF OUR AGENCIES AND THE SEPARATION IS WHAT ENABLES BETTER CHECKS AND BALANCES. IN OUR DAILY COURSE OF BUSINESS WE WORK HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. COVERT NINETEEN HAS DISRUPTED THE WAY IN WHICH WE LIVE AND DO BUSINESS. THE FIRST SCHOOL CLOSED ON MARCH SECOND HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE GOVERNOR ISSUED HIS STAY AT HOME ORDER BEGINNING MARCH NINETEENTH. AND AFTER THAT DAY EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED INCLUDING HOW OUR GOVERNMENT RUNS. AS A CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT CERTIFIED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO. MY BACKGROUND IN ACCOUNTING AUDITING PROPER RECORD KEEPING IN OVERSIGHT HAS BEEN PUT TO GOOD USE AND HAS PUSHED ME AND MY TEAM TO HIGHER LEVELS OF SCRUTINY SINCE STANDARD PAYMENT PROCESSES HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED. AFTER MARCH TWENTY SIX I DIRECTED ANDRE RIVERA TO ALERT ME WHENEVER THERE IS A LARGE COBIT NINETEEN RELATED WIRE TRANSFER. AND HAVE TAKEN IT UPON OUR OFFICE THAT THESE VENDORS THE BEST THAT WE CAN. FROM HAND OUT YOU RECEIVED CALL THE WARRANT PAYMENT PROCESS. ILLUSTRATED. YOU WILL SEE THAT MIGHT MORE MY OFFICE NORMALLY GET INVOLVED IN STEP SIX AND SEVEN. WHEN I PAY EACH PRESENTS A WARRANT THINK OF THIS AS A NORMAL CHECK FROM A CHECKING ACCOUNT. FOR PAYMENT AND WE VERIFY THAT THE WARRANT PRESENTED IS ON THE LIST OF ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING WARRANTS PREPARED BY THE STATE COMPTROLLER. THE OTHER WAY WE GET INVOLVED IS WHEN A WIRE TRANSFER IS REQUESTED. IN THIS INSTANCE WE HAVE PRESCRIBED WIRE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS ALSO BASED ON THE STATE WARRANT PROCESS THAT WE FOLLOWED BEFORE WE RELEASE ANYBODY. AS OF. TODAY MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED FOURTEEN PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST ACT. PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST REGARDING FOR SPECIFIC VENDORS SO I WILL ADDRESS THEM NOW AS THEY RELATE TO MY OFFICE. NUMBER ONE THE BLUE FLAME MEDICAL LLC PAYMENT OCCURRED ON MARCH TWENTY SIXTH. THIS OF URGENCY AND PANIC TRYING TO GET SUPPLIES RUSHING TO COMPETE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STATES CREATED THE NEED FOR EXPEDIENCY WHICH COLOR THE NORMAL PROCESSES IN SELECTING AND VETTING APPROVED VENDORS. AFTER BEING ASSURED FROM THE FOLKS IN STEP ONE IS TO ONE TO THREE IN THE WHITE PAYMENT PROCESS. MY OFFICE INITIATED THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR WIRE TRANSFER THROUGH ONE OF OUR DEPOSITORY BANKS WHO FLAG THE TRANSACTION ITH CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLE FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. SIMULTANEOUSLY THE VIRGINIA BANK THAT RECEIVED THE WIRE CALLED DIRECTOR OF MARK. AND INFORMED HIM THE ACCOUNT WAS OPENED A DAY BEFORE BY WASHINGTON DC BASED LOBBYIST. AND THE BANK WAS NOT COMFORTABLE ACCEPTING THIS LARGE WIRE TRANSFER WHICH IS WHY WE CLAWED THE MONEY BACK. PENDING FURTHER CONFIRMATION OF THE LIFT BUDGET MISSY UP THE PAYMENTS. THE SECOND VENDOR WAS HIT JIM HARRISON AND COMPANY FOR VENTILATORS. ON APRIL THIRD WE WIRED EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THEIR BANK. THAT DEAL FELL THROUGH SINCE THEY COULDN'T SECURE THE EQUIPMENT SO THEY AGREED TO REFUND US BACK THE MONEY. ON APRIL NINTH WE RECEIVED SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ON APRIL FOURTEENTH WE RECEIVED THE REMAINING TWO POINT TWO SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THE THIRD CASES B. Y. DE. AND THE REQUEST TO WIRE FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON APRIL TENTH. AS A DOWN PAYMENT FOR THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR TOTAL CONTRACT FOR SURGICAL MASKS AND IN NINETY FIVE MASS. IN THIS INSTANCE WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED. WHETHER THE PROPER VETTING WAS DONE BY THE FOLKS IN STEP ONE TO THREE. AFTER BEING ASSURED IT WAS WE WIRED THE MONEY TO THE NAME TO MAKE IT COUNT. AS OF TODAY. SOME OF THE SURGICAL MASKS HAVE ARRIVED. HOWEVER THE AND NINETY FIVE MASS HAVE BEEN DELAYED. B. Y. DEEP REFUNDED US TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WAS DEPOSITED BACK IN OUR BANK WITH US LAST FRIDAY MAY EIGHTH. AND FOR THE LAST BENDER IS BEAR MOUNTAIN DEVELOPMENT COMPANY L. L. C. ACCORDING TO THE LOS ANGELES TIMES ARTICLE ON MAY NINTH. THIS ARTICLE SAID THAT TGS CANCELED THE BEAR MOUNTAIN CONTRACT ON MAY SECOND. MY OFFICE DID NOT WHY ARE ANY MONEY IN THE BANK ACCOUNT AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY PAPERWORK ON THIS TRANSACTION. IN CLOSING LET BE AT A RATE THAT THE NEED TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION. YET TO PRODUCE IMMEDIATE RESULTS. IMPACTED THE NORMAL CAREFUL AND DELIBERATE CHECKS AND BALANCES PROCESSES THAT WERE IN PLACE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS CONTROL AGENCIES WE MUST CONTINUE TO BE DISCIPLINED SHE WOULD HERE TO THE PROTOCOLS. OR DEVELOP NEW EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS THAT WE ALL AGREE UPON. AND LASTLY DURING THESE TIMES OF CRISIS WE NEED TO INCREASE COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION AMONG VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AGENCIES AND WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SO WE CAN BE COMPLETELY ACCOUNTABLE TO YOU AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND STEADY HANDS IN PROTECTING OUR ESSENTIAL FIRST LINE DEFENDERS WORKERS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE SHELTERING AT HOME DURING THESE PAST TWO MONTHS. I AM ESPECIALLY PROUD HOWEVER OF MY TEAM WHO STEPPED UP DURING THE PAST EIGHT WEEKS. WE AND I STAND READY TO BE ACCOUNTABLE AND TRANSPARENT IN MY DUTY AS STATE TREASURER. THANK YOU WALL WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS STRONGER TOGETHER. THANK YOU TREASURER MARK OF FOR YOUR DETAILED EXPLICATION OF A SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN AND ALSO FOR THE AT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT. ISSUE AS YOU SAID WERE NEEDED MORE THAN EVER IN IN THE SITUATIONS THAT WE CONFRONTED- ODDNESS RESTAURANTS BONTA COVER NINETEEN ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. MR GRAY. IT'S JUST IT'S JUST A PART. THAT ADDRESS NICE TO SEE YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. OPPOSE THE SAME QUESTION I POSED TO DIRECT YOUR DO SHE IN THE SENSE OF KIND OF GOING FORWARD WHAT DO YOU SEE. AS AN IMPROVED PROCESS OR DO YOU THINK WE HAVE ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS OBVIOUSLY- YOU KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE SAID THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCCESS IN A AND IN SOME SENSE IT IS AS- YOU KNOW YOUR CAPACITY. AS TREASURER IN TERMS OFFICE AS PART OF THAT A MULTI STEP PROCESS- CAUGHT THIS AND- AND OF COURSE- TAX DOLLARS WERE NOT LOST. BUT ARE THERE ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS BE IT IN PROCESS OR EVEN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT ENTITIES WITHIN GOVERNMENT THAT COULD AVOID THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS. IN THE FUTURE. I THINK A DURING TIMES OF CRISIS LIKE THIS- LIKE I SAID MORE COMMUNICATION BETTER COORDINATION- IS ALWAYS OF THE BEST WAY TO GO SINCE MARCH NINETEENTH MY OFFICE HAS A STANDING EIGHT AM CALL EVERY SINGLE MORNING BETWEEN OUR THREE DIVISIONS JUST TO TALK ABOUT. FOR TEN CONTRACTS THAT ARE COMING DOWN THAT WE NEED TO PAY I ALSO HAVE AN INVESTMENTS DIVISION THAT INVEST THE MONEY SO IF A LARGE CONTRACT OUTCOMES- DO THEN MY INVESTMENT OFFICE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE CASH BECAUSE WE INVEST ALL IDLE CASH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAKING ADDITIONAL MONEY. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I WOULD SAY JUST HAVING THREE CONTROL AGENCY ARE COLLABORATE OR COMMUNICATE ON A DAILY BASIS I THINK WOULD DEFINITELY HELP SO THAT WE DO HAVE A FEW. I'M ISSUES THE BEST FALL THE CRAP. THE KEY ORGANIZATIONS BE CONTROLLER OFFICE SOMEBODY IN THE GOV OFF AS WELL AS THE TREASURER'S OFFICE IS THAT MY UNDERSTANDING CORRECT UP YES USUALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES IS THE AGENCY THAT MANAGES ALL CONTRACTS- AS WELL AS REQUEST. THE PAYMENT OF THAT THE CONTRACTS AND THEN IT GOES TO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE OUT FOR ALSO- VETTING AND THE WARRANTS PROCESS AND THEN IT USUALLY COMES TO US. AS LIKE YOUR BANKER WHERE SOMEONE PRESENTS THE WARRANT TO BE PAID OR IN A WIRE TRANSFER SITUATION THAN WE GET DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN MAKING THE WIRE TRANSFER. THANK YOU AND I ALSO ASK THE SAME QUESTION ASKED DIRECTOR DO SHE- MIKE GOULET IN JOHN THOMAS HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF. I HAVE NOT HEARD OF THEM. OKAY AND LET ME ASK THIS- TREASURE SINCE YOU HAD SOME EXPERIENCE PREVIOUSLY SERVING STATE LEGISLATURE. RIGHT I THINK SOMEONE MAYBE TALK ABOUT GOING FORWARD MAINLY MAY NOT BE IN FACT THE PROCESS WHICH ULTIMATELY WAS SUCCESSFUL AND ALSO WHY DID NOT RESULT IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS BEING LOST. BUT WHAT ARE THE OTHER ISSUES SURROUNDING SOME RESISTANCE I THINK WHAT MAY COME UNDER SCRUTINY OR HAVE SOME- APPROPRIATE POLICY DISCUSSION IS KIND OF THE TRANSPARENCY. AROUND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS WHETHER IT BE I KNOW THIS ARTICLE THEY TALK ABOUT POLITICAL FUNDRAISERS AND POLITICAL CONSULTANTS BUT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS- CONSULTED CETERA. BEING INVOLVED IN STATE CONTRACTING A LOT OF THAT PART OF STATE GOVERNMENT ISN'T SUBJECT TO THE SAME- DISCLOSURE RULES THAT MANY OF US ARE SUBJECT TO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE SOMEBODY TAKES MISTER DEAN TO LUNCHEON SPENDS TWELVE DOLLARS- THAT REQUIRE SOMEONE REPORTING. RIGHT CAN YOU GERMAN OPINION ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S AN AREA THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO DIVE INTO TO RACKSTRAW STRENGTH IN THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT OR TAKE SOME ACTIONS TO MAKE SURE- THAT THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES OR OR THE APPROPRIATE. PARENTS EXISTS AROUND CONTRACT. WELL ABSOLUTELY- WE ALL HAVE TO FILE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FOR EXAMPLE EVERY YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DISCLOSING ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST SO ARE ANY- MEASURES THAT SEEKS TO- TO CREATE MORE TRANSPARENCY A SPECIALLY IN PUBLIC CONTRACTING I THINK- IS ALWAYS UP THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION. AT THIS POINT ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE UNKNOWN- YOU'VE MENTIONED SOME SOME INCREASED KIND OF PROTOCOLS ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE ENHANCEMENTS AS FAR AS THE VETTING PROCESS CONCERNED GOING FORWARD FROM THIS DAY. FORWARD DURING THIS CRISIS. I'M LIKE I SAID WE ONLY A ARE BETTING THE WIRE TRANSFER REQUESTS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY. INFORMATION OR REQUEST THAT COME DIRECTLY TO US. IF THE CONTROLLER AT ISSUES A WARRANT MEANING. SEND THE CHECK TO A PAY HE WE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT CHECKS OR PAYMENTS ARE GOING TO AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T SEE ANY OF THE CONTRACTS SO- I'M KIND OF AT THE BACK END OF THE TRANSACTIONS- WOULD LOVE TO BE MORE INVOLVED IF THE PARTIES WOULD LIKE U. CURRENTLY THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS IS- WE ARE REALLY- AT THE BACK END OF THE COLD WAR- PROCESS SO PERHAPS MY QUESTIONS BETTER. DIRECTED TO THE CONTROLLER- AT AT THE TIME THAT WE HAVE THE CONTROL OF THE FOREST TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND I BROUGHT THAT UP WITH THE CHAIR ON THE PERHAPS- WE NEED TO INVITE THE CONTROLLER TO BE PART OF AN ADDITIONAL HEARING OR OR HAVE SOME COMMUNICATION IS NOT TO BE HERE COULD BE MORE INFORMAL OR- A LETTER FROM THE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR- MAYBE FROM. A COUPLE OF THE COMMITTEE'S BUT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD GET SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS AS WELL AS- THE OTHER AGENCIES INVOLVED IN CONTRACT. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT SUGGESTION MR GRAY LET'S WORK ON THAT TOGETHER. THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE AT THIS TIME SO ALL YOU'LL TO MY COLLEAGUES. NUMBER HI I JUST I WILL FIRST I WANT TO SAY I UNDERSTAND THIS IS BEEN A COMPLICATED TIME AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PART- IN THE CHECKS AND BALANCES SYSTEM IN JUST BACK TO- MR GRAY'S QUESTION ABOUT COMMUNICATION I WHAT IS COMMUNICATION RIGHT NOW LOOK LIKE WITH YOU TRADITIONALLY BEING REQUIRED TO JUST TRANSFER THE MONEY WHAT WHAT IS YOUR TRADITIONAL ROLE IN THAT COMMUNICATION AND WHAT DO YOU SEE FOR SEE IN THE FUTURE AS THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU D. G. S. AT OUR GENERAL SERVICES SORRY. AND OTHER CONTROLLER. SO I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO AN EXPERT SO I DON'T MISS SPEAK- SO I'M GONNA HAVE ANDRE COME UP AND MAYBE. JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE- PROCESSES- AND HOW OUR OFFICE. IS INVOLVED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS THANKS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON. SO TYPICALLY- WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS FAR AS PAYMENTS ARE CONCERNED IS HE IS A DEPARTMENT OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE EITHER CONTRACT WORK- AMY CAN THESE BE MADE AND TYPICALLY THAT WILL HAPPEN THROUGH- THEN WORKING WITH THE CONTROLLER AND CREATING A CLAIMS GET DON'T THAT CLEAN SCHEDULE GOING OVER TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE OF THE CUT THAT WAR EITHER ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN. EITHER THE WAR OR EMAIL DIRECTLY OUT TO THE VENDOR- AND IN WHICH THE TREASURER SAID WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY DIRECT CORRESPONDENCE- IT WILL WORK- ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS IF THAT IF THE VENDOR IS REQUESTING WIRED TO BE. SUBMITTED THEY WILL THEN- FOR THAT WAR TO OUR OFFICE AND THEN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE SINCE THAT DIRECTLY TO US AND THEN WE GET WIRE TRANSFER INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND WE WILL IN FACT WIRED THE MONEY ON THE CHURCHES THE PARK. TYPICALLY HOW WE ARE. SO THE STAFF FROM THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE A CONTACT WITH OUR OFFICE SERIOUS WIRING INSTRUCTIONS- AND WE'RE COMMUNICATING BACK AND FORTH THIS IS FAR AS THE AMOUNT. THE DATE THAT THE- THE WAR IS TO GO OUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE WARRANT BEFORE WE SEND OUT ANYTHING. ANYTHING OUT OF THE STATE TREASURY SO THE TREASURER IS NOT ALLOWED TO SAY ANYTHING OUTSIDE IT THE TREASURY WITHOUT A TO THE DRAWING BOARD. AND ONCE WE HAVE THAT IN HERE THAT'S WHAT. IT'S THAT'S CHEAPER HOW WE HANDLE COMMUNICATE BUT IN THIS CASE BEING THAT. YOU KNOW THE PROCESS IS TYPICALLY THAT THE VENDORS THAT IT UP FRONT- BY THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE AND THEN SUBMITTED TO THE CONTROLLERS HERE WHO DOES THE PACKAGE COUNTY. MAKE SURE THERE'S A CORPORATION THE MONEY'S IN THE IN THE FINAL CORRECTLY BEFORE THEY RELEASE A WAR. SO ALL THE CHECKS AND BALANCES OF TYPICALLY THERE. IN IN THIS CASE- WE WERE RELYING UPON THE DEPARTMENT DOING THE VETTING WHICH THEY TYPICALLY DO- WHICH THREE AND AGAIN. WITHOUT THAT'S PROCESS WHICH WOULD NORMALLY TAKE- BUT COME TO FIND OUT LATER THAT IN THIS CASE OBVIOUSLY TO HURRY YES. AVE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT THAT PIECE TO BE JUST A BIT A CHECKED. AND THAT'S PART THAT. HE THAT PART OF THE COMMUNITY NINE IN STRENGTH THAT TO BE SURE THE BETTING IS DONE OF ANYTHING. IT SOUNDS AS IF YES INDEED YES IS NOW. A DONE. A DIFFERENT TAKE ON THAT MEETING IF. HAVE NOW INCLUDED THE THEY HAVE INCLUDED OTHER RESORT IS TO HELP THAT UP FRONT. I THINK THAT GOES A LONG WAYS TO- SATISFYING SOME OF THAT NEED- DEBBIE FROM EARLIER. NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHO THE PLAYERS WERE BEHIND SCENES OF YOU TRANSACTION NOW SOME OF THAT VETTING. TO BE A BEING DONE AND I THINK THAT'S- A VERY GOOD THING. YOUR SIGN UP. THROUGH THE CHAIR. SO WHEN YOU'RE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION YOU ARE NOT REQUESTING THAT YOU BECOME PART OF THE- I DID THE VETTING% PROCESS CORRECT ANYMORE THAN YOU TRADITIONALLY ARE. THAT IS CORRECT I THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE PROCESS DIDN'T WORK IN ESSENCE. THAT IS CORRECT. THANK YOU. WHAT THANK YOU MADAM TREASURE I DO HAVE ONE I ONE MORE QUESTION TO I THINK YOU FOR THAT RECOMMENDATION- WHICH I THINK IS VERY SOUND IN TERMS OF JUST THE NEED FOR ENHANCED COMMUNICATION PARTICULARLY IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS WHEN WE ARE UNDERSTANDABLY WORKING IN AN ENVIRONMENT- PANICKED AND OF DESPERATION BUT SAID THAT SOMETHING THAT- I HOPE WE TAKE FOR IT AND I'M HOPEFUL AND THE FOUR DETECTIVES WORKING WITH YOU TO TAKE THAT FORWARD- AGAIN THAT TO MR GRAY'S IS MYSTERY POINTED OUT YOU PREVIOUSLY SERVED HERE IN THIS BODY. WITH YOUR LEGISLATURE WITH WITH YOUR HAT ON AS A LEGISLATOR ARE THERE OTHER PLACES WHERE YOU THINK YOU KNOW CASH NOW THAT I'VE GOT THIS VANTAGE POINT THAT IS THE STATE TREASURER IN THIS MOMEN OF CRISIS HERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE PERHAPS OUR LAWS NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED TO FURTHER PROTECT CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. WHAT I THINK THE NECESSARY CHECKS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN IN PLACE- BETWEEN THE CONTROL AGENCIES- BUT LIKE. EVERYBODY ALLUDED TO- THINGS WERE HAPPENING VERY QUICKLY- JUST COMPETING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STATES. UP FOR THE PP OUT REALLY- SHORTENED TO WORK- CURTAILED THE NORMAL VETTING PROCESSES AND CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT USUALLY HAPPENS SO. NOW THAT I THINK THINGS HAVE CALMED DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND- DEPARTMENT- YES. ERECTOR COLLEGIATE G. HAS UP FORMED A LARGER COMMITTEE ACT OF THAT THE VENDORS- I THINK THAT IS A VERY GOOD THING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN. AND ON OUR END FOR EVERY WIRE TRANSFER REQUEST THAT COMES TO US WE ARE ALSO DOING THE- BETTING BECAUSE THESE VENDORS ARE NEW TO US- THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IN THE SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME. AND SO WE ARE ALSO TAKING THAT EXTRA- STEP AND DUE DILIGENCE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US- FOR SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR AND AT THE RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR LAST PANEL- HE- HAD TO LEAVE IT ON THE PHONE OR IS IT GOING TO BE ON ANOTHER.

OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE TODAY AND ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. I HAVE MADE YOU COMMENT THAT WE WANTED TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE TODAY I PREFERRED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL COVER NINETEEN EARLY. AND HAD MERGED AS THE COUPLE WORKING. OF BACK YELL AND REALLY UNPRECEDENTED IN A LOT OF WAYS. I THINK CREATED REALLY AN UNPRECEDENTED NEED FOR GOODS AND SERVICES BUDGET PP. AND THEN MINISTRATION. QUICKLY TO THE COUNTRY. GET SERVICES WE THINK THAT MAKES SENSE BUT THE TWO. REALLY CREATED SOME OVER SHALL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE FOR THE LARGEST IN SO I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. I'M IN MY REMARKS TODAY. THERE FROM OUR OR TWO OVER THE KIND OF JOHN THERE OF IN HERE. IN THAT SPECIAL. THERE AND BY DURING THE DOCTORS IN A. HE PRACTICES THAT WHEN I ABOUT VERY QUICKLY THE FIRST IS AND WITH A BIT ABOUT THIS ALREADY TODAY BUT I DO YOU PREFER COUNTRY. CONTRACTORS THAT CONTRACTING WORLD DURING EMERGING COULD YOU THAT. THERE WAS REQUIRED COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND YOU THREE MOBILE BED PUBLIC I. BEFORE THE STATE INTEREST THE COUNTRY. I MEAN THIS IS REALLY TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET THE LOWEST PRICE AND IT'S A FAIR. EVERY TO GET THE STATE BUSINESS HOWEVER THESE WILL. ADRIAN EMERGENCY. IT'S AN IMPORTANT RATIONALE FOR THIS WE'VE HEARD THIS IS REALLY A LIKE OR DEATH SITUATION BE PROCUREMENT YOU HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY AND GO THROUGH THE NET OFF BETWEEN WERE BUT THE VETTING IS AND HOW QUICKLY THE STATE MOVES THAT WOULD SORT OF GO GO ON THAT YOU HAVE TOWARD QUICKER AND HELLO BUT LACKS REAL BAD WHAT THE TYPICAL PROCUREMENT- AND THERE'S CERTAINLY A REASON FOR THAT BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THE TYPE OF PART OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO GIVE. YOU THE LEGISLATURE CONFIDENT CONTRACTOR GONNA BE FAIR AND EVERYTHING'S GOING TO GO AT THAT JEFF ISSUE BUT- A WEEK BECAUSE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS THE FACT THAT THE- A LITTLE BIT OF THAT AND COURSE I'M WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT THAT AND TODAY AND INCLUDE BY A BIT ABOUT THE WAY THE GO MAKING THE PROBLEM. WELL. KIND OF PIECES THE FUNDING UP FOR. TO THE FUNDS APPROACH IS ALSO DIFFERENT THE NUMBER. COULD YOU. THE CURRENT HAVE SECRET FOR THE LARGEST TO THE CUTS AND IT GIVES A LOT REALLY GET OFF TO. SEEK INFORMATION ON HOW BY WILL BE ON THE PROCUREMENT CRACKED THAT WILL BE USED AND ANY OTHER THAT THE LEGISLATURE BILL BUT NEW TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PROVIDE THE FUN. HOWEVER AT THREE MERGING CZ MINISTRY. LEADERS TO OTHER CRAP THAT THE- PARTICULAR USE CONNECTED TO THE BACK THOUGHT EMERGENCY OPERATION ACCOUNT. AND IT DOESN'T TO HAVE EVEN IF YOU TO KEEP A I JUST APPROPRIATION PROCESS FOR THAT SO IF YOU COULD CAN ACT THE DISCOUNT WOULD YOU. SEVEN OF THE FUNDS ECONOMIC AND- THAT A PART OF THE THREE ACCOUNT. WHAT PRIOR NOTICE. OR OFFERING THE FROM THE WHAT. SO THERE'S A REQUIRE. AFTER FACT BASED THAT THE MINISTRATION NOTIFY THE LIKE. WHAT BUDGET COMMITTEE BUT AFTER AT THEIR NO. REQUIRE FOR THE REQUIREMENTS TODAY. OUT BUT. I'M DIDN'T GET MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE COUNTY COULD LEAD TO. I KNOW I GET YEAH BUT I THINK. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT THAT MOST REGENCIES MOST KIND OF DISASTERS HAPPEN QUICKLY EITHER THINGS LIKE WHAT WILD HAIRED HAPPEN OVER A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO GET WELL IT'S THE RESPONSE A DEFINED GEOGRAPHIC AREA WITHIN THE STATE. OCTOBER NINETEEN. THE WERE THOUGHT TO BE PRO LONG GET COULD BE OLD HERE PERHAPS AND IT CERTAINLY AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE STATE. OF WORLDWIDE. AND IT IS REALLY INCREASES THE SCALE AND THE LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH NUMBER TO BE PROCUREMENT TAKE FIVE I'M NOT REALLY RIVAS THEY- ARE RELATED TO AFFECTED OVERSIGHT AND NEEDS ARE AND WE FOR. YOU DID FOR ENTRY IN. EXTREME ALLERGIC. YOU KNOW HUNDRED DIDN'T OF THE OVER BILLION IN SOME CASES. I'M ENTITIES EMERGENCY PROCESSES THAT AREN'T QUITE AS REQUESTED AGAIN THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. AND IT MAKES HOUSING WHEN YOUR SECURING THE VERY LARGE CONTACT A LOT OF MONEY BUT- I'M TO REALLY IF THAT MAKES IT KIND OF A TOUGH SITUATION. AND FINALLY I WANTED TO HIDE IF YOU'RE TRANSFERRING BE. AND WE DIDN'T HAVE. HI LATE BET PARTICULAR PRETTY COVERED HIGH TRANSPARENCY IS A CHALLENGE AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS BEEN THE REASONS THAT I MENTIONED A MINUTE AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE JUST GOT.
