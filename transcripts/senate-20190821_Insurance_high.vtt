CATASTROPHE WERE DOING AN

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:27.967
ASSESSMENT COMPANIES CARE ABOUT

THIS SO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.371
TO GIVE THEM INCENTIVE TO WRITE

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.039
IN THESE AREAS WHICH WILL THEN

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:33.973
REDUCE THE AMOUNT THAT THEY

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.775
WOULD THEN HAVE TO PAY US. IS A

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:37.477
WIN WIN IT HELPS THE CONSUMER

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.512
BECAUSE THEN THESE COMPANIES

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:40.146
WILL WRITE IN THESE AREAS THEY

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.214
WON'T HAVE TO COME TO THE FAIR

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.749
PLAN. CERTAINLY HELPS THE

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.283
COMPANY THAT HAVE TO GIVE LESS

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.953
MONEY TO THE FAIR PLAN AND

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.587
CANDIDLY HELPS THE FAIR PLAN WE

PREMIUMS TO WRITE OUR. KNOW

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.306
WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET'S SAY A

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.875
COMPANY HAS 10% OF THE MARKET

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.611
SHARE IN STATEWIDE BEFORE WE DO

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:12.311
THE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE YEAH

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.080
RIGHT CREDITS LET'S SAY THEY

PREMIUM IN THESE AREAS. WITHIN

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.120
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF AN

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.221
ASSESSMENT THAT THEY WOULD BE

AREAS SO AGAIN IT COSTS THEM

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.262
NOTHING IF ANYTHING COMPANIES

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:31.464

TO ISSUE POLICIES IN. PRONE

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:31.717
AREAS HIGH RISK PRONE AREAS. IN

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:32.852
ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ELIGIBLE

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.453
FOR THAT TAX CREDIT THEY HAVE

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.656
TO IDENTIFY THAT IT IS FOR

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:39.358
THOSE PRONE AREAS THOSE

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:41.127
ISOLATED AREAS YOU CAN'T BE

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:42.728
DISTRIBUTED ELSEWHERE IN THE

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.297
STATE IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.865
CORRECT SO THE CAL FIRE MAPS

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.500
OUR GEO CODED AND WE WOULD

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:50.036
REQUIRE THAT COMPANIES THEY

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:51.270
HAVE TO SUBMIT TO THE FAIR PLAN

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:53.940
ON ANNUAL BASIS. OF WHAT ARE

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:55.041
CALLED RIGHT CREDITS WE

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.275
ACTUALLY GET POLICY LEVEL

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:58.144
INFORMATION AND WE WOULD THEN

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.745
CONFIRM THAT EACH POLICY THAT

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:02.815
THEY SENT US DATA FOR IS IN

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:03.416
FACT. WITHIN THOSE AREAS BASED

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:07.053
ON YOUR COAT. GREAT SO HOW IS

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:07.587
THE EVALUATION OF THE TAX

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:12.725
CREDIT. BORN INTO IN CALCULATED

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.161
BY THE INSURANCE PROVIDERS IS

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:17.196
THERE ANY DEGREE OF OVERSIGHT

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:19.832
THAT WERE EXPECTING TO BE DONE

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:20.399
BY FAIR THAT WOULD IDENTIFY

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:24.503
THAT. THIS IS COMMENSURATE WITH

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.404
THE TAX INSTEAD OF THE

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.907
RECEIVING I'D I DON'T BELIEVE

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:29.075
THERE'S ANY TAX INCENTIVE THAT

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:30.676
THEY'D BE RECEIVING WATCHING ME

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:31.510
THE CREDIT EXCUSE ME YET WE

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.512
WOULD WE WOULD VALIDATE THAT.

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:35.882
SO EVERYBODY HAS TO SUBMIT DATA

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:37.884
TO US ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IF

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.652
THEY SO CHOOSE NOW RIGHT

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:40.519
CREDITS OF COURSE ARE. A

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:42.788
BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY BUT I'M

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:43.990
NOT ALL COMPANIES CHOOSE TO

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.458
PARTICIPATE WERE HOPING

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:47.560
CANDIDLY THAT THE EXPANSION OF

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:48.928
THESE AREAS WILL INCENTIVIZE

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.630
MORE COMPANIES TO NOT ONLY

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.198
WRITE IN THESE AREAS BUT THEN

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.666
CENTERS THAT DATA BUT THEN WE

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.735
WOULD VALIDATE THAT DATE. NOW

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:59.005
IN LLOYDS OF LONDON. DID THEY

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:00.973
