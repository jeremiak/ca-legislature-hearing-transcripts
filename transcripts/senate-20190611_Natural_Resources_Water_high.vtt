00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.890
ALLOW TRAPPERS TO COME OUT AND

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:31.991
PREVENTATIVE WE WORK.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.459
SO THEY DON'T NEED IT LATER.

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:35.328
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:35.928
THAT.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.230
THERE'S A BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.198
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL COSTS THAT

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:40.066
THIS BILL.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.300
THAT THE TRAPPING PROGRAM

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:42.735
CREATES FOR THE STATE TO THERE

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:44.337
WAS AN ANALYSIS A COUPLE YEARS

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:44.937
AGO BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.005
AND WILDLIFE.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.340
THAT ESTIMATES THAT THE TOTAL

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:49.275
COST OF OPERATING THE TRAPPING

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:51.878
PROGRAM IS A LITTLE OVER SEVENTY

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:52.378
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:55.081
WHICH MEANS TO COVER THAT COST.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.616
WITH THE LOW LEVEL OF TRAPPING

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:57.884
THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.585
LICENSE COSTS NEED TO BE A

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:00.920
HUNDRED AND SEVEN DOLLARS.

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:02.488
CURRENTLY THERE A HUNDRED AND

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:04.490
TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS SO THE FEES

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.125
ARE COVERING THE COST OF

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:07.593
OPERATING THAT PROGRAM.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.895
I THINK WHERE THE DISAGREEMENT

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.531
OCCURS IS THE PROPONENTS OF THE

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.032
BILL BELIEVE THAT.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.700
THOSE COSTS SHOULD ALSO COVER

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.602
THE COST OF ENFORCEMENT.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.571
HOWEVER.

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:19.872
IF TRAPPING IS BEYOND.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.874
THAT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE NEED

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.010
TO HAVE WARDENS OUT. TO ENFORCE

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.378
AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:26.245
TRAPPING.

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.281
SO THAT ENFORCEMENT COST REMAINS

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:29.549
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.250
HAVE A TRAPPING PROGRAM.

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:33.319
I'VE HEARD WARDEN SAY HAVING

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:34.887
LICENSE TRAPPERS OUT THERE IS

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.422
HELPFUL.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.191
BECAUSE IT CAN BE EYES AND EARS

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:39.892
TO THE WARDENS. TO MAKE SURE

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.127
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T ACTING

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:42.962
ILLEGALLY THEY CAN I'M PROVIDE

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:44.397

RECREATIONAL TRAPPING.

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.186
ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK IF --

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:56.589
FOLKS ARE INVITING PEOPLE ONTO

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:58.090
LAND FOR RECREATIONAL TRAPPING --

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:00.092
AND THEN THERE ARESUBSEQUENTLY

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.427
SELLING THAT FOR THAT THERE

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:01.761
PROBABLY STE.

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.062
ACTUALLY.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.897
OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THE LAW NOW

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:07.033
ANYWAY THE IDEA I SUPPOSE I I

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.268
CAN'T SHED LIGHT ON WHY SOMEBODY

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:10.703
WOULD RECREATIONALLY.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.874
TRAP AN ANIMAL -- OBVIOUSLY

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.510
THAT'S A VALUE PROPOSITION THAT

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:20.513
DOESN'T -- MAKE A LOT OF SENSE

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:23.215
TO ME -- BUT I'M A LITTLE

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:24.383
CONFUSED BY THAT THAT'S A LITTLE.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.685
CHANGE OF OF COURSE THAT THE

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:29.188
OPPOSITION IS USING -- HOWEVER

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:31.824
IF SOMEBODY REALLY LIKES TO TRAP

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:34.393
ANIMALS AND YOU HAVE A PEST

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.429
PROBLEM ON YOUR PROPERTY -- I

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:37.730
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING AND

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:39.265
CURRENT LAW THAT WULD REQUIRE

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.400
YOU YOURSELF TO SET THE TRAP YOU

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:42.635
COULD HAVE A FRIEND COME OUT AND

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:44.170
SET THE TRAP.

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:47.706
TO DEFEND YOUR PROPERTY AND

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:49.642
WILDLIFE AGAINST -- JURORS ARE

00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:51.143
INVASIVE SPECIES AND SO AS I I

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.446
THINK THERE WOULD BE AN AVENUE.

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:55.915
FOR SOMEBODY WHO GETS A THRILL

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:58.751
OUT OF TRAPPING SMALL ANIMALS.

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:01.954
AND I DO NOTICE THAT.

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:03.889
TRAPPING FOR DEPREDATION

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:08.961
PURPOSES TO A RADIC HE PASSED.

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:10.296

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.934
IN THE STATE AND THERE'S NOTHING

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.102

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.811
I RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:26.745
MAYBE FROM OUR WEST LINN

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:29.515
RESTORATION FOLKS BUT THERE MAY

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.484
BE NEW BUSINESSES NOW THAT

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.351
EMERGED.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.186
AMONG OUR YOU KNOW WETLANDS

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.088

HAS BEEN AND APPROPRIATIONS

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.466
DISCUSSION WHICH ISN'T REALLY

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.068
THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.636
BUT FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE I

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:53.906
THINK IT'S HIGH TIME WE OF ALL.

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:57.943
STATE LAW HERE AND THERE IS ROOM.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.944
PEOPLE ARE STILL GONNA

00:12:59.011 --> 00:12:59.979
RECREATIONALLY HUNT IN THIS

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:03.716
STATE BUT THIS FORM OF PRACTICES --

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:06.785
BARBARIC IN MANY CASES AND IT'S

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:08.454
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE LOOK AT

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:09.989
THE DEFINITION OF USING A STEEL

THOUSANDS OF ACRES -- OPENED UP

00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:22.400
THAT -- THEY ARE INCREDIBLY

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:25.070
VULNERABLE -- THERE MAY BE

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:26.772
OPPOSITION.

00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:27.706

REPAIR TO MAINTAIN SAFETY.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.468
BUT IN SO DOING THERE'S A FAIR

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:57.803
AMOUNT OF EXTRACTION THAT OCCURS

00:23:57.869 --> 00:23:58.837
AT THE SAME TIME [inaudible]

00:23:58.904 --> 00:24:03.441

WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL AS

IT IS TO TRY TO DENY THE

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:02.460
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD BE

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:03.228
NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THAT.

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:04.296
MOVING ONWARD RIGHT -- MOVING

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:07.699

TO PROTECT THAT EXISTING OIL

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.974
DRILLING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I I

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.042
WOULD THINK.

00:26:17.108 --> 00:26:18.276
EXTENT THERE'S BEEN INVESTMENT --

00:26:18.343 --> 00:26:20.278
PERMITTING.

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:21.546
IT WOULD RAISE AN ISSUE INCREASE

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:23.515
SO PLAIN.

00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:28.153
IS ALSO THE SITE OF TWO MASSIVE.

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:29.087

[inaudible]

00:26:49.374 --> 00:26:52.811
AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION I THINK

00:26:52.877 --> 00:26:55.080

TWENTY NINETEEN EQUAL ACCESS

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:55.767

THAT.

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:02.860
AND THE QUESTION IS I'M TRYING

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.296
FACTORS THAT WOULD HAPPEN THAT

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:08.298
MAY BE BUT EVEN STATUTES VERSES

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:09.633

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:24.815

AND LEAVE THE STATE RESPONSIBLE.

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:29.887
AND IN THAT CASE EVEN IF THERE

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:31.688
IS A BOND IT WOULD FALL SHORT OF

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:33.056
WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR THE FULL DE

00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:34.758

THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.413
TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.047
THAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:57.714
THE STATE.

00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:00.784
THERE IS THE OPTION FOR THE

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:02.286
POTENTIAL LESSEE.

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:03.554
TO PUT UP FRONT A 100% OF THE

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.588
SECURITY FOR THE FULL COST OF

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.123
DECOMMISSIONING TO REMOVE THE

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:07.424
INFRASTRUCTURE IN ABANDON ALL

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:09.426
THE WELLS SO WE HAVE THAT MONEY

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:09.993
IN.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.962
IN IN OUR HANDS RATHER THAN THE

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:14.364
POTENTIAL SCENARIO OF BANKRUPTCY.

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:16.967
IT IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:17.534
JUST JUST THE BOND MECHANISM

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:18.869
WITH.

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:20.470
BUT AS A SUPER AT CHALLENGING

00:47:20.537 --> 00:47:21.838
ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF OFFSHORE

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:23.407
OIL AND GAS LEASES BUT IT'S

00:47:23.473 --> 00:47:25.442
REALLY BROADER AND PROVIDES THE

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:32.182
STATE WITH MORE TOOLS.

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:34.484
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE

00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:36.086
IMPORTANCE OF ENUMERATION HERE

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:39.056
OF POWERS POSTED JUST RELYING ON

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:41.225
PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE -- THAT

00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.993
CODIFICATION SEEMS SIGNIFICANT

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.528
ESPECIALLY BASED ON THE DALLAS

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:45.796
PROCEEDING I BELIEVE THERE'S

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:47.331
JUST A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING IN

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:51.001
TEXAS I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.169
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:54.238
SOME OF THESE BILLS.

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:55.706
OR SUSPENDERS WHATEVER MAY BE

00:47:55.772 --> 00:47:59.343
CENTER CABALLERO.

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:00.377
STILL BACK INTO THAT THE BELTS

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:01.411
AND SUSPENDERS THE MAY FIRST

00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:02.679
QUESTION WAS WHY IS THE BILL

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:04.181
NEEDED IN THE SECOND ONE IS.

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:05.549
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:06.116
TRYING TO SOLVE BECAUSE IF

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:07.184
YOU'VE ALREADY.

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:08.518
BEEN DOING THIS.

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:10.387
THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:12.689
DO WE GAIN BY CODIFYING IT THAT

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:14.625
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ALREADY AND IT

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.526
SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU SET UP A

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:18.228
PROCESS.

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:20.097
THAT YOU GOT THE AUTHORITY. TO

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:20.797
MAKE THAT PROCESS SIX FIVE AS

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:22.833
FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE AND ONCE WE

00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:24.868
CODIFY IT THAT'S IT THERE'S NO

00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:26.236
OTHER OPTIONS IN TERMS OF THE

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:28.572
FLEXIBILITY THAT THAT YOU WERE

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:29.172
TALKING ABOUT TOM.

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:30.140
TURNED TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:32.809
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT YOU

00:48:32.876 --> 00:48:34.745
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE IT.

00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:36.480
YEAH A COUPLE THINGS -- WE ARE

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:37.114
WE ARE.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.483
ESSENTIALLY CODIFYING AND THE

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:40.584
FIRST PART OF THE BILL WHAT OUR

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:42.052
CURRENT PRACTICES WHEN WE

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:43.220
CONSIDER WHETHER TO APPROVE A

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:46.490
LEASE TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT --

00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:47.658
BUT THE BILL IS IS.

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:49.760
IT JUST TRIES TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:52.229
THOSE FACTORS WOULD BE AN BILL

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:54.264
IS IS ALSO IN RESPONSE TO WHAT

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:56.133
WE'VE SEEN IN IN RECENT YEARS

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:58.035
AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN VENN ECHO A

00:48:58.101 --> 00:48:58.702
MAJOR.

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.537
LET'S SEE OFF SHORE FILED FOR

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.339
BANKRUPTCY AND LEFT THE STATE

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:03.707
RESPONSIBLE.

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:06.209
FOR ALL OF THAT I REMEDIATION

00:49:06.276 --> 00:49:07.444
AND FINANCIAL COST FOR THE

00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:09.212
PLATFORM AND ALL THE WELLS AND

00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:10.981
IT'S A REALLY IMMENSE COST AND

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:12.316
AN UNDERTAKING.

00:49:12.382 --> 00:49:14.551
AND SO WHEN WE'VE REFLECTED BACK

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:16.787
ON ON THAT SCENARIO AND ALSO

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:19.122
RINCON ISLAND ANOTHER MAJOR.

00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:20.424
OFF SHORE LET'S SEE WHO FILED

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.992
FOR BANKRUPTCY WE REALIZE THAT

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:24.294
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY WE

00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:25.862
SHOULD GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE

00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:26.830
STATUTE AND LOOK AT WAYS.

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:28.398
AND IT CAN BE UPDATED SO IN THE

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:30.667
FUTURE IF WE ARE IN A IN A

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.235
POSITION WHERE THERE'S A MAJOR

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:33.470
LESSEE WHO'S POTENTIALLY

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:35.205
TERMINATING OR QUICK CLAIMING

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:37.074
ARE FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY WE

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.275
HAVE MORE TOOLS.

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:39.810
WE REALLY WANT TO PREVENT THIS

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:41.211
FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE SO

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:43.213
THE STATE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.581
THE FINANCIAL LIABILITY.

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:45.716
OR FOR PROTECTING THE PUBLIC

00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:47.551
HEALTH AND SAFETY IN AN

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:49.319
ENVIRONMENT IF A MAJOR.

FOR BANKRUPTCY.

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:53.657
SO I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:55.859

YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT.

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:09.706
I GET WORRIED ABOUT GIVING

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:12.309
AUTHORITY AWAY IN IN CERTAIN

00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:14.111
INSTANCES WITHOUT THEN TAKING A

00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:15.412
LOOK AT WHAT.

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:17.981
WHAT ARE WE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:18.515

00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:19.383
GRANTING?

00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:20.617
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO COME BACK TO

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:22.018
THE LEGISLATURE OR THAT JUST PUT

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.587
IT ON AUTOMATIC PILOT SO I JUST

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:24.921
NEED TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:25.255
THAT.

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:27.557
YEAH THANK YOU -- IT IS IN PART

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:29.593
CLARIFYING OUR EXISTING PRACTICE

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:31.695
SO AND IN THAT SENSE JUST

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:34.164
RELATED TO A CONSIDERING WHETHER

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:35.432
TO APPROVE A TRANSFER.

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.067
IT'S IT'S NOT PROVIDING ANY

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:38.502
ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY IT'S JUST

00:50:38.568 --> 00:50:40.737
CODIFYING THOSE THOSE FACTORS

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:42.506
WHICH IS IMPORTANT IT'S ALSO

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.274
PROVIDING MORE TRANSPARENCY BY

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:46.143
REQUIRING THAT AT LEAST THAT'S

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:47.177
ASSIGNED OR TRANSFERRED AS

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:48.712
RECORDED IN THE COUNTY WHERE THE

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:50.213
LANDS ARE.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.348
IT ALSO PROVIDES MORE

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:53.116
SPECIFICITY ABOUT WHEN THE

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:55.218

00:50:55.285 --> 00:50:56.253
DECOMMISSIONING.

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:58.789
SO IT'S VERY SPECIFIC WITH IF

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.724
THERE IS A LEASE ASSIGNMENTS BUT

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:02.259
THE COMMISSION APPROVES.

00:51:02.325 --> 00:51:04.461
THIS BILL CLARIFIES IN LAW WHEN

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.963
THE LIABILITY -- STARTS AND AT

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.965
THE PRIOR OPERATOR IS NOT.

00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:11.301
ABSOLVED FROM THEIR LIABILITY

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:16.506
OBLIGATIONS IT ALSO I CLARIFIES

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:17.140
THAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS LIKE

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:18.542
WITH AN ECHO AND THE STATE HAS

00:51:18.608 --> 00:51:19.609
TO STEP IN.

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:21.111
BECAUSE THERE'S A PUBLIC HEALTH

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:22.379

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:24.681
HAZARD BECAUSE THE OPERATOR --

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.016
LET'S SEE ABANDONED THE

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:27.784
FACILITIES BUT THE STATE'S DOING

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:28.985

THE LACK OF ACCESS IS LARGELY

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:32.242
DUE TO EXCESSIVE TRANSPORTATION

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:33.443

THAT THERE'S A REAL NEED TO LOOK

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.022
AT THIS AS WELL AS THAT.

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:34.957
YOU KNOW BACK WHEN THERE WAS A

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.726
FISCAL CRISIS AND THE STATE WAS

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:37.860
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:38.928
WERE GOING TO DO WITH OUR STATE

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:41.864

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.833

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.008
AS BUSY IN OTHER WORDS COLLECT

MUCH MONEY WORD SLATED FOR

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:54.844
CLOSURE AND THAT ULTIMATELY WAS

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.679
STOPPED BECAUSE FRANKLY MOST OF

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.848
THOSE WERE IN WERE IN RURAL

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:01.551
COMMUNITIES WHERE -- THERE IT'S

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:03.519
NOT THAT NATURAL IT'S A

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:04.821
DIFFERENT NATURAL BEAUTY THAN

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.355
THAN THAT THE STATE PARK ON THE

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:07.557

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:08.991
ATTENTION AND SO.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.993
I'M I THINK THERE'S A REAL NEED

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.629
TO LOOK AT HOW WE FIND OUT HOW.

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:15.832
HOW ARE STATE PARKS ARE?

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.266
DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:19.535
AND I A I A REPRESENT AN AREA

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.137
WHERE THERE VERY FEW STATE PARKS

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:23.473
AND WHERE IF THERE'S A STATE

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:26.142
PARK THE IVESTMENT IN THAT PARK

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:26.809
IS VERY.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:30.546
LOW I'M BY THE STATE BECAUSE

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:31.214

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:35.051
WANNA APPLIED YOU FOR THE IDEA

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:37.353
OF TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE IT'S

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.588
ONE THING TO HAVE A STATE PARK

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:38.788
OPEN.

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:41.157

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:48.598
PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET TO SOME

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.032
OF THESE PARKS -- BUT BUT

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:50.666
THERE'S ALSO I THINK WE NEED TO

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:52.034

ABOUT THE PARK AND THEY FEEL

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.213
COMFORTABLE GOING AS WELL SO AND

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:04.881
