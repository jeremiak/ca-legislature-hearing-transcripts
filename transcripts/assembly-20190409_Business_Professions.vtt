TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:16.293
THREE EIGHTY SEVEN A BILL THAT

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:16.893
WOULD MAKE.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.028
MINOR CHANGES TO PRESCRIPTION

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:19.462
DRUG LABELING TO HELP AVOID

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:22.532
CONFUSION REDUCE ERRORS AND

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:23.400
IMPROVE PATIENT SAFETY.

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:24.034
THE GENESIS OF THIS BILL IS A

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.068
CONVERSATION I HAD WITH SOME

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.303
SENIORS IN MY DISTRICT TO

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:27.203
BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THE

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.139
ENORMOUS COSTS OF ADVERSE DRUG

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:29.773
EVENTS.

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.441
CAUSED BY CONFUSION AROUND

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:33.109
PRESCRIPTION DRUG LABELING.

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:34.377
THE ISSUE RESONATED WITH ME

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.412
BECAUSE IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:36.846
MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:38.548
SEVERAL YEARS AGO MY GRANDFATHER

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.417
SUFFERED A SCARY EPISODE WHEN HE

00:53:40.483 --> 00:53:41.818
WAS TRAVELING IN CONFUSED TWO OF

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:43.186
HIS MEDICATIONS.

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:44.588
AS I LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE I WAS

00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:46.623
STRUCK BY THE DATA WHICH

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:47.223
DEMONSTRATES THE SCOPE OF THE

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:48.358
PROBLEM.

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:49.559
DUE TO MEDICATIONS WITH SIMILAR

00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:50.660
NAMES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:51.995
RESPONSIBLE FOR THOUSANDS OF

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.563
DEATHS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:54.931
IN COSTS EVERY YEAR.

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:56.566
IN FACT EACH YEAR ADVERSE DRUG

00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:58.501
OFFENSE ACCOUNT FOR SEVEN

00:53:58.568 --> 00:53:59.135
HUNDRED THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOM

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.770
VISITS A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:02.138
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND COST THE U.

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:03.473
S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FIFTY

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.975
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:06.576
THIS BILL PROVIDES AN EASY WAY

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:07.344
TO PREVENT THOSE ADVERSE

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.745
CONSEQUENCES BY ENCOURAGING

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:10.513
PHYSICIANS TO WHAT'S THE PURPOSE

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.314
OF A DRUG ON ITS PRESCRIPTION

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:12.916
LABEL WHICH HELPS REMIND

00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:14.551
PATIENTS WHICH MEDICATION IS FOR

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:15.552
WHICH ELEMENT.

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:17.053
THE FIX IS A SIMPLE AS ADDING

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.688
TWO OR THREE WORDS FOR EXAMPLE

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:20.890
WRITING FOR ASTHMA OR FOR BLOOD

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:22.692
PRESSURE OR FOR BACK PAIN AT THE

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:23.893
END OF A LABEL.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.195
THE OPTION IS ALREADY AVAILABLE

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:26.763
FOR PATIENTS THIS BILL MERELY

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.732
CHANGES THE CURRENT SYSTEM FROM

00:54:28.798 --> 00:54:30.266
AN OPT IN TO AN OPT OUT.

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:31.801
THE BILL ALSO PRESERVES PATIENT

00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:33.136
PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:34.738
SINCE WHAT IF ANYTHING IS

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.773
PRINTED ON THE LABEL IS ENTIRELY

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.208
THE PATIENT'S DISCRETION.

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:39.876
THE PATIENT CAN DECIDE NOT TO

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:40.644
HAVE ANYTHING PRINTED ON THE

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.278
LABEL OR THE PHYSICIAN CAN

00:54:42.345 --> 00:54:43.279
DESCRIBE THE PURPOSE OF THE

00:54:43.346 --> 00:54:44.648
MEDICATION AT A HIGH LEVEL OF

00:54:44.714 --> 00:54:47.183
GENERALITY SUCH AS FOR INFECTION

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.985
THAT WILL NOT DISCLOSE ANY

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:50.186
SENSITIVE INFORMATION.

00:54:50.253 --> 00:54:51.187
I'M ALSO PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE

00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:52.288
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS

00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:53.657
CONCERNS FROM THE PHARMACIST AND

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:55.225
RETAILERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:57.627
WORK WITH PHYSICIANS TO ADDRESS

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.575
ISSUES TO THIS PROVISION.

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:26.876
SUCH AS HOW MANY TIMES A PATIENT

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:27.911

00:57:27.977 --> 00:57:29.312

THESE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES ALSO

00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:46.930

AS A DRIVER OF THESE COSTS THE

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:55.138
BILL WOULD REQUIRE PHYSICIAN TO

00:57:55.205 --> 00:57:56.539
ASK EVERY PATIENT FOR EVERY

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:57.640
PRESCRIPTION.

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:58.608

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.811
THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHETHER OR

THREE WORDS PRINTED ON THE LABEL

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:07.817

OPPOSITION I THINK THAT THOSE

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:12.388
PROVISIONS WOULD MAKE THE BILL

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.723
BETTER AND I THINK AS THE BILL

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:14.790

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:34.810
CAN OPT THAT OPT OUT CAN BE --

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.179
APPLY PERMANENTLY RATHER THAN

HAVING TO OPT OUT OVER AND OVER

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:38.648

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:31.434
COMMONSENSE RATHER THAN.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.003
AN AUTOMATIC OPT IN WHY NOT JUST

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:34.537

THAT'S TO ME THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:43.012
MORE COMMONSENSE OR IF IT'S IF

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.213

THIS BILL.

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:01.497
I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.098
ISSUE BUT I THINK JUST ASKING

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:02.732
PEOPLE IF THEY WOULD LIKE THAT

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:04.533
INFORMATION ON THEIR LABEL MIGHT

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.203
BE AN EASIER WAY THAN JUST

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.903
MANDATING IT BE ON THERE FOR

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:08.971
EVERYBODY.

YEAH I AND I I JUST TO TO BE

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.440
CLEAR IF I MIGHT RESPOND ESTHER

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.576
CHAIR THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW OUR

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:14.543
ART THE ATTENTION OF THE BILLS

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:15.478
TO TRIGGER A CONVERSATION

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:16.545
BETWEEN AND I I THINK THAT'S

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:17.747
PART OF WHAT'S REQUIRED AS A

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:18.748
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.950
PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT -- AND

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.151
WE'VE PURPOSELY CRAFTER THE

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:23.252
LANGUAGE DOESN'T REQUIRE THE

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:25.154
DIAGNOSIS RIGHT IT REQUIRES THE

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:26.789
PURPOSE AND LEAVES UP TO THE

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:28.357
DISCRETION OF BOTH ULTIMATELY

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:29.358
THE PATIENT BUT ALSO THE FISH

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:30.326
PHYSICIAN.

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:31.894
THE LEVEL OF GENERALITY WHICH TO

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:33.629
DESCRIBE IT SO YOU CAN IMAGINE A

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:34.664
SITUATION WHERE THERE'S

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:37.366
SOMETHING THAT SENSITIVE OR THE

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.734
KIND OF DIAGNOSIS THAT SOMEONE

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.136
MIGHT WANT TO KEEP CONFIDENTIAL

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:42.538
IT'S A 100% IN THE PATIENT'S.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.106
DISCRETION AT THAT POINT TO ASK

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:45.675
THE PHYSICIAN OR TO HAVE A

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:46.942
CONVERSATION POSITIONS A NOW.

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:47.843
I PREFER THAT THAT NOT BE ON THE

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.645
LABEL AND THERE'S NOTHING HERE

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:50.513
THAT WOULD PREVENT THE PHYSICIAN

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.315
FROM SAYING TO THE PATIENT MIGHT

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:53.783
I SUGGEST THAT WE NOT PUT THIS

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:55.017
ON THE LABEL RIGHT SO IT'S I I

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:56.018
THINK IT'S IT JUST LEAVE THE

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.820
FLEXIBILITY FOR VERY COMMONSENSE

01:05:57.887 --> 01:05:58.454
APPROACH.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:00.222
IT ALSO IT THE THE LEVEL OF

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:01.590
GENERALITY WHICH SOMETHING IS

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:05.294
DESCRIBED IS IS UP TO THE IS UP

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:06.128
TO THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:07.363
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT RIGHT

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.797
SO.

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:09.732
RATHER THAN SAYING YOU KNOW FOR

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:10.866
VENEREAL DISEASE YOU COULD CHECK

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.101
FOR INFECTION OR SOMETHING AT A

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:13.235
AT A AT A HIGH LEVEL OF

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:14.637
GENERALITY THAT WON'T DISCLOSE

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.305
ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.640
STILL PROVIDE A TRIGGER OR

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:20.009
REMINDER IF THE PATIENT WANTS.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.344
ONE WITHOUT RECALL WITHOUT

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:22.445
DISCLOSING ANY CONFIDENTIAL

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:23.813
INFORMATION AND YOUR FINAL POINT

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.614
ABOUT AGE YES WE HAVE HEARD A

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:26.415
LOT OF CONCERNS FROM SENIORS

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:27.283
ABOUT THIS.

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.317
BUT WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM FOLKS

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:29.785
ABOUT THE CARE GIVERS OF SENIORS

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:31.020
WHO MAY WANT TO BE REMINDED IF

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:32.355
THERE'S A LOT OF MEDICATIONS.

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:33.856
AND ALSO FOR PARENTS RIGHT TO

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:35.891
HAVE CHILDREN WHO MAY HAVE -- A

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.526
VARIETY OF AILMENTS MAYBE ON A

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:37.993
LOT OF DRUGS IN THEIR

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.261
MINISTERING ALONE A NUMBER OF

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:39.829
DIFFERENT TRUCKS TO THEIR

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.464
CHILDREN TO HAVE A REMINDER ON

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.799
THE BOTTLE -- OF WHICH DRUGS FOR

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:44.867
WHICH EMMET CAN HELP THEM TO

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:45.968
AVOID CONFUSION BECAUSE THE

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.236
NAMES OF THESE MEDICATIONS ARE

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:49.472
SO LONG SO COMPLICATED ARE OFTEN

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:51.107
COMMON NAMES THAT ARE EASY TO

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.942
CONFUSE AND SO THIS IS JUST

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:54.677
ABOUT ADDING TWO OR THREE WORDS.

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.612
AT THE PATIENT SELECTION TO HELP

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.047
AVOID THAT CONFUSION WHICH ARE

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:02.718
WE SEEN AS A WRIT IS A REAL

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.353
ISSUE IT'S IT'S ASSAULTING IN

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:04.987
DEATH IT'S COSTING OUR HEALTH

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:05.521
CARE SYSTEM FIFTY BILLION

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:06.689
DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:07.256
WE THINK THERE'S AN EASY FIX

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:10.459
HERE.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.027
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WHAT.

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:12.895
YES I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:13.596
GABER FOR BRING THIS BILL

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:15.097
FORWARD -- IT KIND OF MAKES ME

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.565
REFLECT ON WHEN I WAS

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:18.334
PRESCRIBING ON A REGULAR BASIS I

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:19.702
WOULD ROUTINELY.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:20.736
THIS IS BEING PRESCRIBED FOR

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:23.239
PAIN THIS IS BEING PRESCRIBED --

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:25.274
FOR INFECTION I DID THAT --

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:26.776
MAKES ME NOW WONDER IF I'M IN

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:28.878
VIOLATION OF SOMETHING -- BUT

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:31.080
BUT BECAUSE I KNEW THAT MY

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:32.848
PATIENTS DIDN'T ALWAYS KNOW.

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.216
WHAT THE THIS PARTICULAR

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:35.518
MEDICATIONS WERE?

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:37.253
FOR NOW AS I CARE FOR MY MY

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.088
MOTHER WHO HAS -- SOME COGNITIVE

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:41.290
ISSUES -- AND IN SHARING THAT

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:43.225
CARE WITH TWO BROTHERS WHO HAVE

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:45.294
NO EXPERIENCE IN HEALTH CARE --

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:46.762
AND SHE'S TAKING A MYRIAD OF

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.097
MEDIC MEDICATIONS AND BEING

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:49.865
ASSISTED BY AN ASSISTED LIVING

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:51.934
FACILITY THERE -- TRYING TO KEEP

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.302
TRACK OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:54.804
MEDICATIONS ARE FOR IS A

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.105
CHALLENGE WHEN YOU DEAL WITH

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.306
MULTIPLE PARTIES SO I I

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.175
COMPLETELY APPRECIATE THE

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:00.342
PRIVACY CONCERNS.

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:02.011
BUT I ALSO AND GET CONCERNED

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:03.345
THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:05.848
CONFUSION AND THAT A PATIENT A

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.383
PERSON MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.018
TAKING THE WRONG MEDICATIONS ARE

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:09.485
TOO MUCH OF THE WRONG

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:12.221
MEDICATIONS -- AND SO -- YOU

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.756
KNOW I CAN'T CONTROL SOMEONE

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:16.692
GOING INTO SOMEBODY'S -- HOUSE

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.160
AND AND DO THAT AND I CERTAINLY

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:19.094
DON'T EXPECT THE PEOPLE ARE

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:20.229
WALKING AROUND WITH ALL THESE

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:21.497
MEDICATIONS AROUND THEIR NECKS

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:22.531
AND I CAN NECKLACE.

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.433
SO -- SO I APPRECIATE WHAT

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.101
YOU'RE DOING -- WASN'T EVEN

01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:28.971
AWARE THAT -- THERE WAS -- AN

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:31.273
OPT IN POTENTIAL OUT THERE

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.576
BECAUSE I JUST ROUTINELY WE CAN

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:34.643
PRESCRIBE A LOT OF THAT IS

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:35.277
REALLY DIDN'T PRESCRIBE THINGS

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:36.412
IN DENTISTRY.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.112
THAT WOULD RAISE A LOT OF

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.414
EYEBROWS SO THEY'RE A COUPLE

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:39.849
MEDICATIONS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:41.050
WONDER ABOUT.

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:42.852
BUT BUT SO I APPRECIATE WHERE

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:43.786
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SUPPORT

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.354
YOUR BILL TODAY AND I HOPE THAT

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:46.922

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:48.224
CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.458
AND PRIVACY CONCERNS ARE AN

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:51.060
ISSUE BUT I ALSO THINK -- SAFETY

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:53.395
IS AN ISSUE -- FOR PEOPLE AND

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.930
AND AND SOME SENIORS ARE HAVING

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:57.099
SCHOOL HAVING HAVING CHALLENGES

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:58.734
SO I APPRECIATE PRETTY WEIRD

01:08:58.801 --> 01:08:59.235
WHICH WERE YOU TRYING TO

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:04.440

I REALLY APPRECIATED COMING

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:11.947
FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND THE

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:14.049
SITE ABOUT WANTING TO MAKE SURE

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:15.985
THAT WE HAVE -- SOME KIND OF

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.187
IDENTIFIER ON THE LABEL TO MAKE

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:19.488
SURE THAT PEOPLE TAKING THE

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:21.290
RIGHT PRESCRIPTIONS -- AT THE

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:22.958
SAME TIME I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:24.560
PRIVACY CONCERNS -- SPECIALLY

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:25.694
THAT MY COLLEAGUE DR EGGMAN

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.830
BROUGHT UP AS WELL I SURE THOSE

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:30.032
CONCERNS A SHE ARTICULATED A LOT

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.867
MORE A LOT BETTER THAN I COULD --

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:33.769
SO I FIND MYSELF IN A A PLACE

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.671
TODAY WHERE I'D PROBABLY NOT

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:36.906
GOING TO VOTE ON THIS BUT I DO

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:38.340
LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING IT.

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:40.809
AS IT MOVES FORWARD WITH THE

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:42.011
CONTINUED WORK THAT YOU HAVE

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:44.580
COMMITTED TO DOING TO MAKE SURE

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:45.714
THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES.

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:50.152
THE ONE THING THAT -- DID CATCH

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:50.953
ME REAL QUICK WAS THAT YOU WERE

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.355
TALKING ABOUT JUST INITIATING A

01:09:53.422 --> 01:09:54.423
FIFTEEN SECOND CONVERSATION WITH

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.525
THE WITH THE DOCTOR AND THAT

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:57.092
WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR MORE

01:09:57.159 --> 01:09:58.027
ADMINISTRATIVE.

01:09:58.093 --> 01:09:59.929
COULD NOT ALREADY BE DONE NOW

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.864
WITH THE FIFTEEN SECONDS --

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.499
CONVERSATION WHERE THE DOCTOR

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:05.134
ADDRESSES THE PATIENT SAYS WOULD

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.202
YOU LIKE ME -- TO PUT THIS ON

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:10.973
THE PRESCRIPTION LABEL -- OR IS

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.841
IT IN YOUR ESTIMATION ABSOLUTE

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:15.244
NECESSARY THAT WE SWITCH OF FROM

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:17.713
AN OPT IN TO AN OPT OUT.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.849
I I'M NOT SURE -- BY THE WAY THE

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:21.383
CONVERSATION TO TAKE PLACE

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:21.684
[inaudible]

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.352
SO.

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:24.787
YEAH I THINK I THINK THANK YOU

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:26.522
FOR THE QUESTION I APPRECIATED --

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:27.756
AND AND ALSO THE VERY CIRCUIT

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:29.758
SINCE YOUR PRIVACY CONCERNS AND

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:32.428
UNDERSTAND THOSE -- THE THE THE

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.163
THINKING ABOUT GOING FROM -- IN

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:36.599
OPT INTO AN OPT OUT IS WHEN IT'S

01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:38.233
AN OPTION IT REQUIRES THE

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.868
PATIENT TO KNOW THAT SO YOU

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.003
THERE BEEN SOME SUGGESTION THAT

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.570
RATHER DURING THIS BILL WE

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.105
SHOULD DO AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:44.206
BUT AT THAT POINT WE'RE GONNA

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:45.541
TRY TO EDUCATE FORTY MILLION

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:46.208
PEOPLE.

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.610
ABOUT THE SPECIFIC RIGHT THAT

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.078
THEY HAVE WHO HAVE LESS

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:50.145
INTERACTION WITH THE HEALTH CARE

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:51.747
SYSTEM MAY ONLY GET A COUPLE OF

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.682
PRESCRIPTIONS A YEAR -- VERSUS

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:55.017
GOING TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.452
PRESCRIBING MEDICATION

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:58.287
PRESUMABLY EVERY DAY -- HAVE A

01:10:58.354 --> 01:10:59.388
LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THEM AND

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:02.157
JUST PUTTING ON THEM -- THE ONUS

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.359
TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:05.160
THEIR PATIENTS AND YOU KNOW I'VE

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:06.695
EXPRESSED TO TO SEE A MAN TO

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:08.097
OTHERS -- WILLINGNESS -- TO

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:09.498
STRUCTURE THE IMPLEMENTATION IN

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:11.033
A WAY THAT WOULD BE FEASIBLE TO

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:11.867
PERHAPS HAVE DELAYED

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.303
IMPLEMENTATION GIVE THEM TIME TO

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.638
TO TRAIN AND WORK WITH PHYSICIAN

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:16.639
SO THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF THIS

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:17.272
REQUIREMENT.

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:18.540
AND PHASE IT IN IT IN A WAY THAT

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.776
WOULD BE -- THE MOST AMENABLE

01:11:20.843 --> 01:11:22.811
FOR THAT SO I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:23.979
BUT IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF YOU

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:25.280
KNOW WHAT DO WE DO WE NEED TO WE

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:26.248
EDUCATE FORTY MILLION

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:27.650
CALIFORNIANS ABOUT THE RIGHT TO

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:29.985
OPT IN OR DO WE ASK FORTY FOUR

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:30.753
THOUSAND PHYSICIANS HAVE A

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.896
YEARS.

01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:55.964
ALLOWING.

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.332
THERE'S PRACTITIONERS FULL SCOPE

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:58.834
AUTHORITY WAS ONE THAT REPORTS

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.069
TOP RECOMMENDATIONS THE BILL FOR

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:02.337
BEFORE YOU HAS THREE KEY

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:04.072
COMPONENTS FIRST ARE THE

01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:05.307
PATHWAYS TO PRACTICING

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:06.475
UNSUPERVISED.

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:07.509
THE NURSE PRACTITIONER CAN

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:08.610
EITHER WORK AS A PART OF AN

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:10.612
INTEGRATED TEAM WHAT THEY WANT

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:11.546
TO PRACTICE OUTSIDE THOSE

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.048
SETTINGS THERE IS A REQUIREMENT

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:14.883
FOR A THREE YEAR TRANSITION TO

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:15.917
PRACTICE.

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:16.952
WHICH ONE BALL COMPENSATE MONEY

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.386
WILLS AND AN EXAM.

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:20.288
SECOND IS A REGULATORY STRUCTURE

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:21.756
INCLUDING A NEWLY CREATED BOARD

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:23.191
OF ADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:24.326
NURSING IT TAKES INTO

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:25.694
CONSIDERATION THE NEED FOR

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.095
PHYSICIAN INPUT AND INVOLVEMENT

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:28.563
WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.165
MAINTAINING A SINGLE STANDARD OF

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:30.932
CARE.

01:19:30.999 --> 01:19:32.300
THIRD IS AN APPROACH THAT

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:33.702
PRESERVES THE CORPORATE BAN ON

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:34.836
THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE.

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.371
SO THE PRACTICE IN PEACE WILL BE

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:37.839
TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.274
PHYSICIANS WHILE ALSO PRESERVING

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:40.542
THE ABILITY OF NURSE

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:41.643
PRACTITIONERS TO REMAIN

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:42.144
EMPLOYEES.

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:44.045
THEY CHOOSE BUT WITH DIFFERENT

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.313
RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES THAN THOSE

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.848
REPORTED AUTONOMOUS.

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:49.951
AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS ON ON A

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:50.852
HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF.

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:51.620
I BELIEVE THIS RISK FRAMEWORK

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:52.821
RIGHT REPRESENTS A BALANCE

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.723
BETWEEN GREATER AUTONOMY AND A

01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:55.790
CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO SERVE AS

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:57.058
JURORS ADDITIONAL CLINICAL

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.060
EXPERIENCE AND MENTORSHIP PRIOR

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:01.263
TO ALLOWING AND THEN P.. TO WORK

01:20:01.329 --> 01:20:02.597
OUTSIDE AN INTEGRATED SETTING WE

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:03.698
STILL HAVE ISSUES TO ADDRESS

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:05.700
INCLUDING HOW TO TRANSITION INTO

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:07.202
THE NEW PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT WAS

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:08.970
EXISTING MPS WHO HAVE BEEN MANY

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:10.572
YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE.

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:11.806
AS WELL SOME PRACTICAL ISSUES

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.175
INVOLVING THE TRANSITION TO A

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.576
NEW REGULATORY BOARD.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:15.977

WE CONDUCTED RESEARCH AND SIX

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:36.384
STATES WITH DIFFERENT SCOPES OF

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:37.552
PRACTICE.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.521
IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE LOOKED AT

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:40.722

FINDING A SUPERVISOR.

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:59.007
CHANGING A SUPERVISOR ONE ONE OR

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:01.242
THE OTHER LEFT THE PRACTICE.

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.544
SCHEDULING MEETINGS COULD

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:05.513
COMPETE WITH PATIENT CARE TIME.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.315
IT'S ALSO COSTLY SUPERVISION IS

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:08.817
COSTLY TO THE ORGANIZATION

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:10.719
WHETHER IT'S A COST IN PAIN THE

SUPERVISION -- IN EXTRA SALARY

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:15.757
YOU'RE TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.159
PATIENT CARE TAKING MONEY AWAY

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.461
FROM PATIENT CARE BASICALLY.

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:21.663
IT'S CAN BE COSTLY TO INDIVIDUAL

POCKET COSTS.

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:26.801
IN SOME STATES WE FOUND THAT

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:27.769
THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:29.137
PAYING UP TO THREE THOUSAND

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:30.972
DOLLARS OUT OF THEIR POCKET FOR

WE FOUND THE PRACTITIONERS

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:04.606
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:05.774

IF WE CAN FIND A PSYCHIATRIST TO

DEVELOP FRAMEWORK THAT IS

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.479
CONSISTENT WITH THE FRAMEWORK WE

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:53.981
HOWEVER MAJOR AND SUBSTANTIAL

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:55.683
SUBSTANTIVE DETAILS ARE YET TO

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.218
COME IN DISCUSSION.

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.052
THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY

01:30:58.119 --> 01:30:59.053
COMMITTEE AND THE FIRST HOUSE

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.154
AND WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:02.089
THERE WAS A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:02.623
TO ALLOW FOR DISCUSSION TO

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:04.025

COMMITTEE AMENDS ACHIEVE THAT

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:07.061

FINISHED PRODUCT THERE STILL ARE

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.064
SIGNIFICANT AREAS IN WHICH WE

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:11.299
DIFFER FROM THE AUTHOR AND

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:12.567
SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL THAT

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:13.968
IMPACT PATIENT SAFETY.

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:15.169
SUCH AS THE GRANDFATHERING IN OF

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:16.804
KERR NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE

01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:18.339
COMPETENCY TEST REQUIREMENT.

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:19.473
AND LANGUAGE THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.208
INCLUDED TO ENSURE LAY

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:21.843
INDIVIDUALS AREN'T INTERFERING

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:23.177
WITH THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE.

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:25.012
OFTENTIMES PEOPLE THINK THAT THE

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:26.347
CORPORATE BAR SIMPLY IN THE CUT.

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:28.816
THINK OF THE COVER BAR SIMPLY IN

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:30.117
THE CONTEXT OF EMPLOYMENT.

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:30.885
IF THERE'S A WHOLE SET OF RULES

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:31.752

THEIR CLINICAL JUDGMENT.

01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:36.090
AS A NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:37.959
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:38.459
ENSURES THIS REMOVAL OF

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:39.227
SUPERVISION.

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:41.028
WILL ADDRESS ACCESS TO CARE WE

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.231
SHOWCASES THE FACT THE NURSE

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:44.699
PRACTITIONERS DON'T MOVE TO

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:45.900
RURAL AREAS WHEN GRANTED

01:31:45.967 --> 01:31:47.201
INDEPENDENT PRACTICE AND NOTHING

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:49.237
IN THE BILL ENSURES THAT THEY

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:50.404
WILL DO THAT IN CALIFORNIA.

01:31:50.471 --> 01:31:51.439
WE'RE COMFORTABLE CONTINUING

01:31:51.505 --> 01:31:53.007
THIS CONVERSATION BUT ASK THE

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:54.075
MEMBERS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO

01:31:54.141 --> 01:31:54.842
CHANGE THEIR VOTE ON THE FLOOR

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:56.811
OF THIS IS YET TO BE AS THIS IS

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:57.678
YET TO BE FULLY COOKED

01:31:57.745 --> 01:31:59.013
LEGISLATION WITHOUT WE REMAIN

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.215
OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED BUT LOOK

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:04.385
FOR ITS ON GOING DISCUSSIONS.

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:05.853
THANK YOU TERM LOW AN ASSEMBLY

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:06.821
COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.322

BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN IN

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:11.225
PRIVATE PRACTICE AND IN THE

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:12.593
UNIVERSITY SETTING.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.128
AFTER HEARING ABOUT THIS BILL I

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.130
CANCELED MY CLINIC TODAY AND

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:18.299
FLEW IN LAST NIGHT TO BE HERE.

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.034
I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF PHYSICIANS

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.102
FOR PATIENT PROTECTION A

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:23.070
GRASSROOTS GROUP OF TEN THOUSAND

01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:24.472
PHYSICIANS ADVOCATING FOR

01:32:24.538 --> 01:32:25.973
PHYSICIAN LIKE CARE.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.141
AND TRANSPARENCY AND HEALTH CARE

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:28.476
PROVIDERS.

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:30.578
I WANT TO EXPRESS MY OPPOSITION

01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:33.014
AB EIGHT NINETY AS IT STANDS.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.815
I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:36.617
THAT I HAVE A DEEP RESPECT FOR

01:32:36.684 --> 01:32:37.752
NURSE PRACTITIONERS AS THEY ARE

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:38.986
INTEGRAL MEMBERS OF THE

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.788
HEALTHCARETEAM.

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:42.456
THIS IS NOT A TURF WAR.

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:44.025
MY MOTHER WAS A GRADUATE OF THE

01:32:44.091 --> 01:32:45.526
FIRST NURSE PRACTITIONER CLASS

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:47.728
AT UC DAVIS AT A I UNDERSTAND

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:48.863
THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR ROLE IN

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:50.498
HEALTH CARE.

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:52.266
HOWEVER I ALONG WITH MOST

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:53.935
PHYSICIANS IN THIS STATE ARE

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.469
OPPOSED INDEPENDENT PRACTICE OF

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:57.171
MEDICINE BY ADVANCED PRACTICE

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:59.273
NURSES WHO HAVE 3% OF THE TOTAL

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.908
TRAINING OF A BOARD CERTIFIED

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:03.144
PHYSICIAN. TO BE CLEAR NURSE

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:04.712
PRACTITIONER TRAINING IS NOT

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:06.180
EQUIVALENT TO PHYSICIAN TRAINING

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:07.949
IT IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:09.650
TRAINING BASE IN NURSING CARE

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:11.519
INSTEAD OF MEDICAL CARE. TO

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:12.853
BELIEVE THAT ADVANCED PRACTICE

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.855
PROVIDERS ARE OR CAN BECOME

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.557
EQUIVALENT TO BOARD CERTIFIED

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:18.292
PHYSICIANS IS NOT ONLY INCORRECT

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:19.627
IT'S DANGEROUS.

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:20.962
IT'S ANALOGOUS TO A DENTAL

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:22.263
HYGIENISTS PRACTICING

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.998
INDEPENDENT DENTISTRY OR

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:25.800
PARALEGALS PRACTICING LAW.

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:27.601
I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THIS

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:29.537
BILL IS TO ATTEMPT TO FILL THE

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:31.539
VOID OF A PERCEIVED PHYSICIAN

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:34.141
SHORTAGES SPECIAL IN RURAL AREAS.

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:35.543
MY MOM IS A FAMILY NURSE

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:37.345
PRACTITIONER IN A REAL HEALTH

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:38.913
CARE CLINIC IN THE CENTRAL

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:40.881
VALLEY FOR FORTY YEARS.

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:42.483
AND CARED FOR THE POPULATIONS

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:44.118
THAT ARE AT GREATEST RISK.

01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:45.619
HOWEVER RECENT STUDIES HAVE

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:46.754
SHOWN THAT IN STATES WHERE AND

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:47.989
P. INDEPENDENCE THAT

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:49.623
INDEPENDENCE IS LEGAL.

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:52.093
A SMALL PERCENTAGE ARE IN RULES

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:53.961
SETTINGS AND THE RATS PRACTICE

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:55.596
IN URBAN AND SUBURBAN SETTINGS

01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:57.031
AND MOST PRACTICE SPECIALTY CARE

01:33:57.098 --> 01:33:59.967
INSTEAD OF PRIMARY CARE OR

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:00.968
PSYCHIATRIC PSYCHIATRY.

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:01.736
THIS CLOSELY MIRRORS THE

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:02.870
PRACTICE DISTRIBUTION OF

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:04.605
PHYSICIANS AND DOESN'T REALLY

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:06.207
ALLEVIATE.

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:08.075
ANY SHORTAGES IN CARE.

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:09.510
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:11.078
BILL FAILS TO MANDATE THAT ANY

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.346
NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO CHOOSE

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:14.015
TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY SHOULD

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:15.983
ONLY DO SO WITHIN RURAL AREAS.

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:17.985
I WENT IN THE FIELD THE PRIMARY

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.520
CARE ONLY.

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:20.888
WITHOUT THIS STIPULATION THE

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:22.189
CORE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:23.958
LEFT UNADDRESSED.

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:25.159
UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:26.727
TRAINING AND OVERSIGHT OF NURSE

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:28.629
PRACTITIONERS IS NOT ADEQUATE

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:29.964
FOR INDEPENDENT PRACTICE IN THE

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:31.365
FIRST PLACE.

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:33.434
THE REALITY IS THAT YOU CANNOT

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:35.036
LEGISLATE EDUCATION.

01:34:35.102 --> 01:34:36.370
NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE NOT

01:34:36.437 --> 01:34:38.839
EDUCATED IN THE ART OF MEDICINE.

01:34:38.906 --> 01:34:40.341
NOR DO THEY UNDERGO RIGOROUS

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:41.675
TESTING TO VALIDATE THEIR

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:43.010
COMPETENCY.

01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:44.378
THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT WE DO

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:46.981
NOT HAVE A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE.

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:49.817
WE HAVE A LEGISLATIVE BOTTLENECK.

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:51.685
EVERY YEAR EIGHT THOUSAND

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:53.187
MEDICAL STILL SCHOOL GRADUATE

01:34:53.254 --> 01:34:55.056
PHYSICIANS DON'T MATCH AND A

01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:56.891
RESIDENCY POSITIONS BECAUSE THE

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:57.925
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:34:57.992 --> 01:34:59.860
MAINTAINED ITS FUNDING CAP OF

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:01.495
MEDICARE FUNDED RESIDENCY

01:35:01.562 --> 01:35:03.898
POSITION SINCE.

01:35:03.964 --> 01:35:04.732
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN DESPITE

SCHOOL FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED MORE

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:10.471
HOURS OF HANDS ON CLINICAL

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:11.405
PRACTICE.

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:13.441
THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS FIVE

01:35:13.507 --> 01:35:14.675
HUNDRED HOURS OF SHADOWING THESE

01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:16.811
ON MATCH POSITIONS ARE NOT

01:35:16.877 --> 01:35:17.244
ALLOWED TO PRACTICE

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:18.245
INDEPENDENTLY.

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:19.680
INSTEAD OF SPENDING LARGE

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.082
AMOUNTS OF MONEY INCREASING

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:22.383
NURSE PRACTITIONER TRAINING AND

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:24.585
CREATING A NEW REGULATORY BOARD

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:25.653
FOR THEM.

01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:26.620
PERHAPS WE SHOULD FIND MORE

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.355
RESIDENCY POSITIONS AND

01:35:28.422 --> 01:35:30.124
INCENTIVIZE PHYSICIANS TO STAY

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.892
WITHIN UNDERSERVED AREAS TEN

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:33.027
SECONDS LEFT THERE ARE OTHER

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:34.195
OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:35.296
QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND RULE

01:35:35.362 --> 01:35:36.864
SETTING BUT THIS BILL AS IT

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:38.332
STANDS IS NOT THE ANSWER.

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:39.500
I BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER WILL

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.335
INVOLVE SOME PERMUTATION OF AN

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:43.137
INCREASE IN PHYSICIAN RESIDENCY

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:44.905
POSITIONS AND INCENTIVES FOR

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:46.407
BOTH PHYSICIANS AND NURSE

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:49.076
PRACTITIONERS. TO PRACTICE

AN OPPOSE LESS AMENDED ON THIS

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:11.365
BILL.

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:13.167
PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENTS WERE

01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:14.668
STUDYING THEM -- I THINK WE

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:15.769

NEWSPAPERS -- CREATES -- FROM A

02:06:26.779 --> 02:06:28.047
PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT.

02:06:28.113 --> 02:06:31.917
ARE A MUCH WORSE HARM -- THIS IS

02:06:31.984 --> 02:06:33.686
A PROBLEM THAT SEEKS LAW

02:06:33.752 --> 02:06:34.954
ENFORCEMENT BETTER LAW

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:39.792
ENFORCEMENT -- FOR IN -- FOR FOR

02:06:39.858 --> 02:06:41.026
ENSURING THAT THE LAW IS

02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:43.395
FOLLOWED BUT IN DEPUTISING

02:06:43.462 --> 02:06:44.763
NEWSPAPERS THAT IS NOT THE

02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:47.633
ANSWER AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:50.669
FOR A NO VOTE.

02:06:50.736 --> 02:06:51.236
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

02:06:51.303 --> 02:06:52.504
COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME'S

02:06:52.571 --> 02:06:54.473
MARK POWERS AND I REPRESENT THE

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:56.075
RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:57.242
THAT SERVE YOUR DISTRICTS.

02:06:57.309 --> 02:06:58.844
A WE POSE THIS BILL BECAUSE WE

02:06:58.911 --> 02:06:59.912
ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE MEDIA

02:06:59.979 --> 02:07:01.780
SHOULD NOT BE A REGULATORY ARM

02:07:01.847 --> 02:07:02.614
OF GOVERNMENT.

02:07:02.681 --> 02:07:04.383
THAT WOULD BE A HUGE CHANGE IN

02:07:04.450 --> 02:07:06.051
CURRENT ADVERTISING ALONG THE

02:07:06.118 --> 02:07:07.920
RADIO AND TV STATIONS IN YOUR

02:07:07.987 --> 02:07:09.355
DISTRICT ARE CONVEYORS OF

02:07:09.421 --> 02:07:10.489
INFORMATION.

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:12.291
NOT ENFORCERS OF THE LAW THE

02:07:12.358 --> 02:07:13.959
REGULATORY BURDENS YOU IMPOSE

02:07:14.026 --> 02:07:15.627
SHOULD ALWAYS FALL ON THE

02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:17.730
CREATORS OF THE INFORMATION.

02:07:17.796 --> 02:07:19.231
THAT YOU MIGHT THINK THAT

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:21.266
ENSURING AN ADVERTISEMENT HAS A

02:07:21.333 --> 02:07:22.835
LICENSE NUMBERS A MINIMAL EFFORT.

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:24.169
BUT IT HAS TO BE AN ACCURATE

02:07:24.236 --> 02:07:25.871
LICENSE NUMBER WHICH MEANS

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:28.140
STATIONS COULD NEVER RELY ON THE

02:07:28.207 --> 02:07:30.009
ADVERTISER TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

02:07:30.075 --> 02:07:30.943
INFORMATION.

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:32.644
ALWAYS HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK WITH

02:07:32.711 --> 02:07:34.780
WHATEVER REGULAR RATE REGULATORY

02:07:34.847 --> 02:07:36.582
AUTHORITY THERE WAS.

02:07:36.648 --> 02:07:38.083
NOW AFTER YOU PASS THIS BILL

02:07:38.150 --> 02:07:39.651
IMAGINE THE SAME LOGIC THAT

02:07:39.718 --> 02:07:41.420
YOU'RE GONNA APPLY TO REAL

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.888
ESTATE AND CONTRACTORS LICENSES

02:07:42.955 --> 02:07:45.491
NUMBERS DISCLOSURES AN AUTO ADDS

02:07:45.557 --> 02:07:47.259
DISCLOSURES AND POLITICAL ADS.

02:07:47.326 --> 02:07:48.660
FOOD BRED **** AND PRODUCT

02:07:48.727 --> 02:07:51.597
CLAIMS AND SO ON THE REASON WHY

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:52.965
MEDIA IS NOT PLACED IN THIS

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:54.033
POSITION.

02:07:54.099 --> 02:07:55.034
THEY WOULD HAVE TO KNOW THE

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.302
SPECIFIC LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL

02:07:57.369 --> 02:07:58.470
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR

02:07:58.537 --> 02:08:00.539
ADVERTISING EVERY POSSIBLE

02:08:00.606 --> 02:08:02.941
INDUSTRY AND ITEM FOR SALE.

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:05.177
YOUR STATIONS INFORM ADVERTISERS

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:06.445
WHEN THEY SEE AN ERROR.

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:08.347
AND THEY REFUSE ADS WHEN THOSE

02:08:08.414 --> 02:08:09.448
ERRORS ARE NOT CORRECTED.

02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:11.116
BUT KNOWING WHAT THOSE COUNTLESS

02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:13.819
POSSIBLE REGULATORY ISSUES MIGHT

02:08:13.886 --> 02:08:15.687
BE IS NOT THEIR JOB AND

02:08:15.754 --> 02:08:17.056
CERTAINLY NOT THE RIVER LEGAL

02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:18.624

ALREADY ACCOMPLISH THIS WOULD BE

02:09:42.174 --> 02:09:43.308
POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO

02:09:43.375 --> 02:09:46.545
ADDRESS THE EXPANSION -- TO BE

INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US TO TRY

AND ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH

02:10:44.136 --> 02:10:46.572
EXISTING LAWS AND AND REDUCE.

02:10:46.638 --> 02:10:48.941
THE ADVERTISING OF NON LICENSE

02:10:49.007 --> 02:10:50.375
SERVICES.

02:10:50.442 --> 02:10:51.743
I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL

02:10:51.810 --> 02:10:53.545
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:55.948

SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF AND

02:10:59.017 --> 02:11:00.152
REYES BY THE OPPOSITION.

02:11:00.219 --> 02:11:01.053
SO.

02:11:01.119 --> 02:11:02.120
I I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH

02:11:02.187 --> 02:11:04.423
REQUIRING A SOPHISTICATED

02:11:04.489 --> 02:11:05.958
PLATFORM LIKE WE'D MAPS TO

02:11:06.024 --> 02:11:07.826
COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA LAW

02:11:07.893 --> 02:11:09.027
REGARDING CANNABIS I THINK IT'S

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:10.495
REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THEY

02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:11.930
WOULD BE EXPERTS ON WHAT THAT

02:11:11.997 --> 02:11:14.233
LAW SAYS BUT OTHER ADVERTISING

02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:16.401
PLATFORMS I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S

02:11:16.468 --> 02:11:16.969
REASONABLE AND I'LL GIVE AN

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:17.236
EXAMPLE.

02:11:17.302 --> 02:11:18.904
I THAT IS YOU KNOW I COME FROM A

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:19.838
VERY SMALL TOWN.

02:11:19.905 --> 02:11:20.672
I ONE OF THE SMALLEST IN MY

02:11:20.739 --> 02:11:22.207
DISTRICTS AND AND WE HAVE ONE

02:11:22.274 --> 02:11:23.709
PAPER IN TOWN THE BIG BEAR

02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:25.043
GRIZZLY -- IT'S GOT A

02:11:25.110 --> 02:11:27.446
CIRCULATION OF JUST A COUPLE OF

02:11:27.512 --> 02:11:28.380
THOUSAND COPIES IT ONLY COMES

02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:31.450
OUT ONCE A WEEK.

02:11:31.516 --> 02:11:32.751
SO -- FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT

02:11:32.818 --> 02:11:34.386
LET'S SAY THE SOMEONE ADVERTISES

02:11:34.453 --> 02:11:35.754
CANNABIS FOR SALE IN THE GRIZZLY

02:11:35.821 --> 02:11:37.022
I DON'T THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO

02:11:37.089 --> 02:11:38.257
EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD BE.

02:11:38.323 --> 02:11:40.225
EXPERTS ON CALIFORNIA CANNABIS

02:11:40.292 --> 02:11:42.728
LAW AND MY READING OF THE BILL

02:11:42.794 --> 02:11:43.996
LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT IF THEY

02:11:44.062 --> 02:11:45.264
WERE TO ALL MET.

02:11:45.330 --> 02:11:47.299
THE LICENSE NUMBER ALTHOUGH THE

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:48.900
ADVERTISER WOULD IF THEY WERE TO

02:11:48.967 --> 02:11:49.434
MAKE A LIGHT THEIR LICENSE

02:11:49.501 --> 02:11:51.236
NUMBER.

02:11:51.303 --> 02:11:51.803
AND THE GRIZZLY WERE NOT TO

02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:53.338
CATCH IT -- AND THEY WERE TO

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:54.506
CORRECT THAT IF THAT AIR WAS

02:11:54.573 --> 02:11:55.607
BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION THEY

02:11:55.674 --> 02:11:56.475
WERE CORRECT AT THE VERY NEXT

02:11:56.541 --> 02:11:58.677
ISSUE THAT SEVEN DAYS A TWENTY

02:11:58.744 --> 02:11:59.311
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY THEY

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:00.212
BE LIABLE.

02:12:00.279 --> 02:12:01.446
FOR ALMOST TWENTY THOUSAND

02:12:01.513 --> 02:12:03.115
DOLLARS IN -- AND CIVIL

02:12:03.181 --> 02:12:05.284
PENALTIES AND I DON'T THINK THAT

02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:07.185
THAT'S THAT'S REASONABLE.

02:12:07.252 --> 02:12:08.553
YEAH I ALSO.

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.088
TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:12:10.155 --> 02:12:10.722
RIGHT A PRIVATE ACTION IN THE

02:12:10.789 --> 02:12:11.690
BILL.

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:13.425
BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED THAT --

02:12:13.492 --> 02:12:15.260
RATHER THAN GOING AFTER THE

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:16.795
SOPHISTICATED ACTORS LIKE WE

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:19.464
PERHAPS THAT WILL HAVE OPEN THE

02:12:19.531 --> 02:12:21.099
DOOR TO LAW FIRMS GOING AFTER

02:12:21.166 --> 02:12:22.401
THE UNSOPHISTICATED ACTORS LIKE

THE BILL HAD BEEN NARROWED A

02:12:32.377 --> 02:12:34.079
LITTLE BIT TO RECOGNIZE SOME OF

02:12:34.146 --> 02:12:35.180

02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:40.585

02:12:44.256 --> 02:12:45.991
WORKING WITH THE THE COMMITTEE

02:12:46.058 --> 02:12:47.292

02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:49.127
THIS BILL IS STILL GOING TO DO

02:12:49.194 --> 02:12:50.696
JUDICIARY AND I'M.

02:12:50.762 --> 02:12:52.764
THE COMMITTEE CHAIR HAS --

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:55.367
AGREED TO WORK WITH ME ON TRYING

02:12:55.434 --> 02:12:57.002

02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:58.970
THINK THE BIGGER PICTURE I AGREE

02:12:59.037 --> 02:12:59.871
WITH YOU BUT THE BIGGER PICTURE

02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:07.279
IS THAT -- WE ARE ADVERTISING ON

02:13:07.346 --> 02:13:11.183
REGULATED -- DISTRIBUTORS AND

02:13:11.249 --> 02:13:13.185
THIS IS DANGEROUS NOT JUST. FOR

02:13:13.251 --> 02:13:13.985
SELF BUT SOME OF THESE THESE --

02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:14.619
PRODUCTS ARE NOT TESTED SO IT'S

02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:15.253
DANGEROUS TO THE HEALTH OF THE

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:16.755
COMMUNITY AND SO I WILL CONTINUE

02:13:16.822 --> 02:13:18.357

COMPLIED WITH BECAUSE THEY HAVE --

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:38.543
I THINK THE THE VENDOR WITH

02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:40.245
SAYING THAT IT'S WE DON'T HAVE A

02:13:40.312 --> 02:13:41.580

DEAL WITH RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA.

02:18:44.282 --> 02:18:46.117
AND I ACTUALLY DID A OVERVIEW

02:18:46.184 --> 02:18:47.552
THAT BALLOT MEASURES IT WORKED

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:49.587
ITS WAY ON TO CALIFORNIA CHOICES

LOCAL ORDINANCE RETRO A TAX ON

02:19:01.766 --> 02:19:03.234
MARIJUANA CULTIVATION.

02:19:03.301 --> 02:19:06.271
WHICH PASSED IT BY MORE THAN 55%

02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:06.571
[inaudible]

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:09.641
SO.

02:19:09.708 --> 02:19:11.209
AS I APPROACH THIS ISSUE AND

02:19:11.276 --> 02:19:13.645
THIS BILL.

02:19:13.712 --> 02:19:16.915
THE CENTERPIECE OF AB TWO SIX

02:19:16.981 --> 02:19:18.249

COMMITTEES VOTE IN THE SPRING OF

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:23.254
TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS A CENTERPIECE

02:19:23.321 --> 02:19:24.923
OF WHAT WENT TO THE GOVERNOR I

02:19:24.989 --> 02:19:25.557
ACTUALLY WROTE THE GOVERNOR THAT

02:19:25.623 --> 02:19:28.059

02:19:33.364 --> 02:19:33.932
MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS TO

02:19:33.998 --> 02:19:34.566
OPERATE.

02:19:34.632 --> 02:19:35.800
THAT'S CREDIBLE STATEWIDE

02:19:35.867 --> 02:19:40.939
STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:19:41.005 --> 02:19:42.640
THIS WAS AN ALMOST TWENTY YEAR

02:19:42.707 --> 02:19:44.943
IMPASSE ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA

02:19:45.009 --> 02:19:46.044
YEAR TO YEAR THE LECTURES AND

02:19:46.111 --> 02:19:47.412
FAILED TO ADOPT RULES.

02:19:47.479 --> 02:19:48.546
BOARD THAT LOCAL CONTROL

02:19:48.613 --> 02:19:50.849

TWENTY FIFTEEN DEAL THAT WENT TO

02:19:51.616 --> 02:19:53.651
THE GOVERNOR HE SIGNED INTO LAW.

02:19:53.718 --> 02:19:55.653
THIS TO ME IS WHY THE PROPONENTS

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:58.256
OF PROP [inaudible]

02:19:58.323 --> 02:19:59.824
SIXTY FOUR IN.

02:19:59.891 --> 02:20:02.594
SIXTEEN SAID AS THEY DID SAY.

02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:03.728
THAT IT WOULD PROTECT THE LOCAL

02:20:03.795 --> 02:20:06.030
AUTHORITY.

02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:07.098
THAT IS WHAT THE BALLOT

02:20:07.165 --> 02:20:09.200
ARGUMENTS SAID.

02:20:09.267 --> 02:20:10.502
THAT IS WHAT THE SO THE

02:20:10.568 --> 02:20:11.970
ARGUMENTS MADE ON BEHALF OF BY

02:20:12.036 --> 02:20:13.171
THE PROPONENTS SAID OF PROTECT

02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:14.439
ALL CONTROL.

02:20:14.506 --> 02:20:17.175
THE LA OWES IMPARTIAL BALLOT.

02:20:17.242 --> 02:20:19.778
STATEMENTS SAID THE SAME THING

02:20:19.844 --> 02:20:20.078
[inaudible]

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:24.215
AND I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED

02:20:24.282 --> 02:20:24.516
[inaudible]

02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:27.685
THAT.

02:20:27.752 --> 02:20:29.254
THIS LEGISLATURE.

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:31.322
BY SAFEGUARDED LOCAL CONTROL SO

02:20:31.389 --> 02:20:32.924
THE LOCALS DO NOT ACTUALLY FEEL

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:34.159
THREATENED.

02:20:34.225 --> 02:20:36.461
BY STATE LICENSURE.

02:20:36.528 --> 02:20:38.229
BY LOCAL NOT HAVING A GRIPE

02:20:38.296 --> 02:20:40.398
ABOUT STATE REGULATION AS I

02:20:40.465 --> 02:20:42.267
COULD MOST ARE YOU SURE THEY

02:20:42.333 --> 02:20:43.668
GRIPE ABOUT THE A. B. C.'S.

02:20:43.735 --> 02:20:45.069
APPROVAL OF NEW LIQUOR STORES

02:20:45.136 --> 02:20:47.038
AND BARS IN CITIES AND COUNTIES

02:20:47.105 --> 02:20:48.173
WITH VERY LITTLE.

02:20:48.239 --> 02:20:49.340
SAY.

02:20:49.407 --> 02:20:51.743
THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY DIDN'T GO

02:20:51.810 --> 02:20:54.112
DOWN THAT TRAIL OF TAKEN AWAY

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:55.580
LOW CONTROLLERS SAFEGUARDED.

02:20:55.647 --> 02:20:57.248
AND EVEN IN THE COURSE OF THE

02:20:57.315 --> 02:20:58.883
MEDICAL MARIJUANA CONVERSATION.

02:20:58.950 --> 02:21:01.019
MY ASSIST WAS ALWAYS.

02:21:01.085 --> 02:21:02.487
I HAD TWO GUIDING PRINCIPLES A

02:21:02.554 --> 02:21:04.856
GUIDED THAT WHOLE CONVERSATION

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:06.958
AND THIS BILL TIES INTO IT.

02:21:07.025 --> 02:21:09.494
SAFEGUARD LOCAL CONTROL.

02:21:09.561 --> 02:21:10.995
AND IF YOU SAFEGUARD LOCAL

02:21:11.062 --> 02:21:13.431
CONTROL WHAT YOU'LL GET IS SOME

02:21:13.498 --> 02:21:14.799
JURISDICTIONS MAY BE MORE

02:21:14.866 --> 02:21:17.035
COMFORTABLE EARLIER.

02:21:17.101 --> 02:21:19.437
BUT THEY WILL SHOW HOW THESE

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:21.973
BUSINESSES ACTUALLY DO WORK.

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:23.541
SO THE PARADE OF HORRIBLE'S THAT

02:21:23.608 --> 02:21:25.343
LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR MINDS

02:21:25.410 --> 02:21:28.780
ABOUT HOW BAD THESE BUSINESS ARE.

02:21:28.847 --> 02:21:29.614
CAN GET SORTED OUT THEY JUST

02:21:29.681 --> 02:21:32.283
REALIZE OKAY MY APPREHENSIONS

02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:33.751
ARE NOT WELL FOUNDED IN FACT.

02:21:33.818 --> 02:21:35.019
AND THIS WILL ALLOW OTHER

02:21:35.086 --> 02:21:38.056
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE RESISTANT

02:21:38.122 --> 02:21:38.656
AT FIRST TO KIND OF FALL INTO

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:39.858
LINE [inaudible]

02:21:39.924 --> 02:21:43.695
AND THIS BILL.

02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:45.063
WHICH WILL SAFEGUARD THAT

02:21:45.129 --> 02:21:46.130
ABILITY MAINTAIN A BAND IF

02:21:46.197 --> 02:21:48.333
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT.

02:21:48.399 --> 02:21:50.301
ALSO INCORPORATES A BUDGET ASK

02:21:50.368 --> 02:21:53.872
FOR GRANTS. TO SUPPORT LOCALS AS

02:21:53.938 --> 02:21:56.407
A START OPEN UP THIS MARKET TO

02:21:56.474 --> 02:21:58.409
GET SOME HELP ON ENFORCEMENT.

02:21:58.476 --> 02:22:00.245
SO THIS BILL CARRIES OUT THE

02:22:00.311 --> 02:22:02.881
VISION THAT I WAS AT THE HEART

02:22:02.947 --> 02:22:07.719
OF BY ADVOCACY AND AND PROP.

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:08.253
TWO SIX SIX RESPECT LOCAL

02:22:08.319 --> 02:22:09.320
CONTROL.

02:22:09.387 --> 02:22:10.588
BUT AT THE SAME TIME TRY TO WOO

02:22:10.655 --> 02:22:12.724
THE LOCALS TO GET PASTOR PRAYED

02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:14.525
FOR BULLS DEAL WITH THE REALITY.

02:22:14.592 --> 02:22:15.960
AND THIS TO ME IS A MUCH MORE

02:22:16.027 --> 02:22:18.596
SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM STRATEGY

02:22:18.663 --> 02:22:20.365
FOR HOW WE AS LAWMAKERS.

02:22:20.431 --> 02:22:23.234
CAN FIND A WAY TO ADVANCE PUBLIC

02:22:23.301 --> 02:22:24.903
POLICY WITHOUT.

02:22:24.969 --> 02:22:27.105
CREATING CONFLICTS BELOW THE

02:22:27.171 --> 02:22:29.040
COMPLEX WORK THEMSELVES OUT BY

02:22:29.107 --> 02:22:31.843
ADROIT LEADERSHIP -- I WANT TO

02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:33.311
SAY THAT THE DECISION OF THIS

02:22:33.378 --> 02:22:35.113
COMMITTEE AT THAT.

02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:36.648
AT THAT FIRST TERRY TO PASS.

02:22:36.714 --> 02:22:39.183
THE BILL OVERWHELMINGLY THE HEAD

02:22:39.250 --> 02:22:40.852
LOCAL CROLLES HEART.

02:22:40.919 --> 02:22:41.853
PLAYED OUT IN OUR HOUSE

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:45.056
DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE COME JUNE.

02:22:45.123 --> 02:22:46.124
WHEN THE SENATE WAS MOVING A

02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:47.025
BILL DEALING WITH MEDICAL

02:22:47.091 --> 02:22:48.660
MARIJUANA?

02:22:48.726 --> 02:22:50.461
THE AUTHOR IN THE END THAT HOUSE

02:22:50.528 --> 02:22:51.462
MUSTARD A PRETTY GOOD VOTE OF

02:22:51.529 --> 02:22:53.364
THE SENATE FOR ON THE SAME DAY

02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:54.299
ARE VOTE WAS TAKEN.

02:22:54.365 --> 02:22:56.668
THEY GOT A TWO TO ONE VOTE

02:22:56.734 --> 02:22:57.268
TWENTY SIX TO THIRTEEN AND FOR

02:22:57.335 --> 02:22:58.903
THE SENATE.

02:22:58.970 --> 02:23:00.204
GOOD JOB BY SENATOR MCGUIRE.

02:23:00.271 --> 02:23:03.107
BUT ON THAT DAY IN OUR HOUSE.

02:23:03.174 --> 02:23:05.710
THE ASSEMBLY PASSED.

02:23:05.777 --> 02:23:07.245
THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILL OF

02:23:07.312 --> 02:23:10.548
LOCAL CONTROLS HEART.

02:23:10.615 --> 02:23:11.082
SIXTY TWO TO EIGHT SO WE

02:23:11.149 --> 02:23:13.685
ACTUALLY SIDE WITH LOCAL CONTROL.

02:23:13.751 --> 02:23:16.154
BROUGHT PEOPLE THE MIDDLE.

02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:16.654
AND ACTUALLY CREATED THE

02:23:16.721 --> 02:23:18.890
MOMENTUM THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE

02:23:18.957 --> 02:23:21.025
PROPONENTS OF PROP SIXTY FOUR

02:23:21.092 --> 02:23:21.960
SUPPORTED IT.

02:23:22.026 --> 02:23:24.228
RODE INTO SIXTY FOR USE IN THEIR

02:23:24.295 --> 02:23:25.897
ARGUMENTS WHY THE LA -- SOUGHT

02:23:25.964 --> 02:23:29.167
THEIR AND AND IT'S WHY I NOW

02:23:29.233 --> 02:23:30.668
BRING THIS BILL ST I'M STILL A

02:23:30.735 --> 02:23:32.103
PROPONENT OF PRESERVING LOCAL

02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:33.237
CONTROL.

02:23:33.304 --> 02:23:34.906
BUT I STILL HAVE IN MIND THIS

02:23:34.973 --> 02:23:36.374
LONG TERM STRATEGY AS YOU

02:23:36.441 --> 02:23:37.408
RESPECT LOCAL CONTROL.

02:23:37.475 --> 02:23:39.377
YOU CAN.

02:23:39.444 --> 02:23:41.212
ENCOURAGE JURISDICTIONS YOU KNOW

02:23:41.279 --> 02:23:42.213
THEY WERE SORT OF JAMMED UP WITH

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:43.514
THE WAY PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS

02:23:43.581 --> 02:23:44.916
PASSED.

02:23:44.983 --> 02:23:46.217
THEY HAD TO HAVE A POLICY IN

02:23:46.284 --> 02:23:49.687
PLACE BY JANUARY FIRST.

02:23:49.754 --> 02:23:50.288
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WHEN YOU

02:23:50.355 --> 02:23:51.389
HAVE A SHORT TIME FRAME LOCAL

02:23:51.456 --> 02:23:53.291
GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT SOMETHING.

02:23:53.358 --> 02:23:54.492
YOU CAN TRY TO GET A NEW US

02:23:54.559 --> 02:23:56.060
POLICY WHICH INVARIABLY TAKES A

02:23:56.127 --> 02:23:59.364
LONG TIME A LOT OF CONVERSATION.

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:01.065
WE JUST GO THE BAN.

02:24:01.132 --> 02:24:02.467
SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THE

02:24:02.533 --> 02:24:03.901
NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT

02:24:03.968 --> 02:24:05.570
HAVE BANDS I DON'T ACTUALLY

02:24:05.636 --> 02:24:07.405
BELIEVE THAT REPRESENTS LONG

02:24:07.472 --> 02:24:09.007
TERM ANIMUS.

02:24:09.073 --> 02:24:10.408
TOWARDS THIS POLICY CHANGE THAT

02:24:10.475 --> 02:24:12.176
THE VOTERS OF BRACED.

02:24:12.243 --> 02:24:15.913
I SEE THAT AS EXPEDIENT REACTION.

02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:18.850
TO FILL IN THE CLOCK LOOMING.

02:24:18.916 --> 02:24:19.884
AND JUST TAKE IT A STEP TO KIND

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:21.886
OF INSURE THAT LOCAL CONTROL WAS

02:24:21.953 --> 02:24:23.287
RESPECTED.

02:24:23.354 --> 02:24:25.590
AND SO TO ME THIS BILL

02:24:25.656 --> 02:24:28.092
REPRESENTS A LONG ONGOING EFFORT

02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:29.460
ON MY OWN PART TO KIND OF WORK

02:24:29.527 --> 02:24:31.729
IN THIS BASED RESPECT LOCAL

02:24:31.796 --> 02:24:32.697
CONTROL.

02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:33.431
BUT THE SAME TIME TO ADVANCE

02:24:33.498 --> 02:24:36.434
POLICY AND TO AVOID TRAIN WRECKS.

02:24:36.501 --> 02:24:37.468
AND JUST SUPPORT DISABILITY FOR

02:24:37.535 --> 02:24:39.303
ALL.

02:24:39.370 --> 02:24:41.039
EVERY ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

02:24:41.105 --> 02:24:42.206
OF ALL FIVE HUNDRED CITIES TO

02:24:42.273 --> 02:24:44.409
KIND OF TAKE A MORE [inaudible]

02:24:44.475 --> 02:24:47.178
STOP HYPERVENTILATING.

02:24:47.245 --> 02:24:47.779
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE PRINTER

02:24:47.845 --> 02:24:49.180
HORRIBLE.

02:24:49.247 --> 02:24:51.482
FOCUS ON THE FACTS AND MAKE SOME

02:24:51.549 --> 02:24:53.051
SPECIFIC DECISIONS.

02:24:53.117 --> 02:24:54.352
AND ON THE ISSUE OF OF THEM

02:24:54.419 --> 02:24:58.990
ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA I DO

02:24:59.057 --> 02:24:59.490
WANT TO SAY [inaudible]

02:24:59.557 --> 02:25:01.025
THAT.

02:25:01.092 --> 02:25:03.094
I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT EVEN

02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:04.162
MAJOR SEARCH WHICH BANDS

02:25:04.228 --> 02:25:06.297

IS THE RIGHT TO FIFTEEN AFFORDED.

02:25:11.402 --> 02:25:13.137
AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S ACTUALLY

02:25:13.204 --> 02:25:14.872
NO MEMBER IN THE ORIGINAL GANG

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:16.507
OF FIVE WORK ON THIS.

02:25:16.574 --> 02:25:18.609
THAT WAS MORE PERSISTENT INSANE

02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:21.112
DO NOT LOSE TRACK OF ACCESS TO

02:25:21.179 --> 02:25:22.914
MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:25.616
INDEED IN THE BILL THAT WE SENT

02:25:25.683 --> 02:25:28.920

PROVISION I INSISTED BE THERE.

02:25:39.597 --> 02:25:42.366
AND EVEN PROP SIXTY FOUR DOES

02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:43.668
NOT STATE OVER RULED THAT.

02:25:43.734 --> 02:25:45.203
IT DOES SAY THEY TRIED TO

02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:46.671
STREAMLINE THINGS THAT SORT OF

02:25:46.737 --> 02:25:47.738
THING BUT SOUL.

02:25:47.805 --> 02:25:49.707
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT.

02:25:49.774 --> 02:25:51.142
ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA IS

02:25:51.209 --> 02:25:53.344
IMPORTANT.

02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:56.681
UC SAN DIEGO HAS THE MEDICAL.

02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:07.258
AND CANNABIS. TO DEAL WITH

02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:08.759
EPILEPSY AND MANY OTHER

02:26:08.826 --> 02:26:10.862
AFFLICTIONS.

02:26:10.928 --> 02:26:11.395
IN A WAY THAT'S ACTUALLY

02:26:11.462 --> 02:26:12.663
SUPERIOR TO MORE OPIOID BASED

02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:13.865
THING SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:26:13.931 --> 02:26:14.999
ENCOURAGED THAT.

02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:17.635

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:23.841

DIVERSE POPULATION AND WIDE

02:28:35.273 --> 02:28:36.073

PROMISE TO THOSE WHO PASSED PROP

02:28:47.852 --> 02:28:49.053
SIXTY FORMED UNDER THE BELIEF

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:51.188
THAT LOCAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE

02:28:51.255 --> 02:28:53.391

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF A DUAL

02:28:57.762 --> 02:28:59.196
LICENSING STRUCTURE WOULD BE

02:28:59.263 --> 02:29:00.331
ABLE TO ALLOW.

02:29:05.903 --> 02:29:06.871
COMMUNITIES.

02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:07.872
AND WAS REALLY ONE OF THE MAIN

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:09.874
REASONS THE MEASURE RECEIVED THE

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:10.508
SUPPORT THAT IT DID FROM CITIES

02:29:10.574 --> 02:29:12.443

AWAY -- FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

02:29:22.553 --> 02:29:23.621
AND REALLY SERVES THE CLEAR

02:29:23.688 --> 02:29:24.689
OVERREACH THE BCC AND ULTIMATELY

02:29:24.755 --> 02:29:26.757
MADE FOR AN UNJUSTIFIED

SURE ONE MINUTE LEFT.

02:29:30.761 --> 02:29:31.829
SO I MEAN REALLY IN OUR

02:29:31.896 --> 02:29:32.363
ESTIMATION CURRENT RULE IS

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:33.631
CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT -- WHERE

02:29:33.698 --> 02:29:34.265
THE ILLICIT MARKET CAN GROW AND

02:29:34.332 --> 02:29:35.032
THRIVE WITHOUT FEAR OF CRIMINAL

02:29:35.099 --> 02:29:36.600
CONSEQUENCE -- WHICH IS THE

02:29:36.667 --> 02:29:39.003
OPPOSITE OF WHAT PROP SIXTY FOUR

02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:41.872

02:29:41.939 --> 02:29:42.239
ACHIEVE.

02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:44.742
AND SO YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY AB

02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:46.477
FIFTEEN THIRTY WOULD RECTIFY THE

02:29:46.544 --> 02:29:47.712
IMPACT OF OF ANY UNINTENDED

WITH BANDS BUT THOSE WITH MANY

02:29:50.448 --> 02:29:52.116
ORDINANCES AND EVEN THOSE WHO

02:29:52.183 --> 02:29:54.018
AUTHORIZED DELIVERY WERE TRYING

02:29:54.085 --> 02:29:54.852

FROM.

02:29:55.486 --> 02:29:56.420

02:30:05.863 --> 02:30:07.765
RESTORING THE ABILITY OF LOCAL

02:30:07.832 --> 02:30:09.000

REGULATE AS THEY SEE FIT FOR

02:30:12.703 --> 02:30:14.605

ABLE TO SUPPORT TODAY -- THIS

02:52:38.147 --> 02:52:40.383
BILL. FOR THE FOR THE SIMPLE

02:52:40.450 --> 02:52:44.654
REASON THAT -- DELIVERY IS A WAY

02:52:44.721 --> 02:52:47.256
OF ACCESS NGUYEN -- THE BANNING

02:52:47.323 --> 02:52:48.891
OF OF THE PRODUCT AS FAR AS

02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:51.127
GROWTH I I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A

02:52:51.194 --> 02:52:53.262
A PROVISION FOR MEDICAL GROWTH

02:52:53.329 --> 02:52:55.298
TO BE ABLE -- TO FOR FOR FOLKS

02:52:55.364 --> 02:52:55.898
TO BE ABLE TO GROW FOR MEDICAL

02:52:55.965 --> 02:52:58.434
PURPOSES HOWEVER AS WAS STATED

02:52:58.501 --> 02:53:00.670
IN PRIOR TESTIMONY -- RENTERS

02:53:00.737 --> 02:53:02.572
MAY NOT BE IN THAT POSITION TO

02:53:02.638 --> 02:53:05.508
BE ABLE -- I AND TO TO

02:53:05.575 --> 02:53:06.576
PERSONALIZE THIS A LITTLE BIT

02:53:06.642 --> 02:53:08.778
THERE'S NO DOUBT -- THAT MY

02:53:08.845 --> 02:53:10.646
MOTHER WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY HAD

02:53:10.713 --> 02:53:12.381
SHE JUST HAD ACCESS.

02:53:12.448 --> 02:53:14.851
AND BECAUSE OF THAT -- OPIATES

PRETTY MUCH HARDEN HER BODY UP

02:53:16.085 --> 02:53:16.786
FROM HEAD TO TOE.

02:53:16.853 --> 02:53:18.688
SO WITH THAT ACCESS FOR ME IS

02:53:18.755 --> 02:53:20.890
THE THE BIGGEST BIGGEST ISSUE

02:53:20.957 --> 02:53:22.358
EVEN THOUGH I DO SUPPORT LOCAL

02:53:22.425 --> 02:53:24.761
CONTROL I FELT LIKE THE DELIVERY

02:53:24.827 --> 02:53:29.932
WAS A WAS THE MEDIUM THAT THAT

02:53:29.999 --> 02:53:31.067
ACCESS.

02:53:31.134 --> 02:53:33.736
NGUYEN A LOCAL JURISDICTION

02:53:33.803 --> 02:53:36.339
WOULD PAN -- OTHER PARTS OF IT

02:53:36.405 --> 02:53:38.741
WHETHER IT BE STOREFRONTS

02:53:38.808 --> 02:53:40.076
MANUFACTURES OR WHATEVER SO -- I

02:53:40.143 --> 02:53:42.011
APPRECIATE THE INTENT AND WANT

02:53:42.078 --> 02:53:43.780
TO HELP TRY TO PRESERVE LOCAL

02:53:43.846 --> 02:53:45.948
CONTROL IN EVERY WAY I CAN --

02:53:46.015 --> 02:53:49.218
BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT HINDER --

02:53:49.285 --> 02:53:52.188
ACCESS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IF

02:53:52.255 --> 02:53:53.956
YOU WILL I DO UNDERSTAND THAT IT

02:53:54.023 --> 02:53:55.625
IS THE HOPE OF THE AUTHOR

02:53:55.691 --> 02:53:56.559
RELEASED I DO MAYBE YOU CAN HELP

02:53:56.626 --> 02:53:59.996
ME -- THAT LOCAL AGENCIES WOULD

02:54:00.062 --> 02:54:03.099
THEN WITH LOCAL CONTROL BE ABLE

02:54:03.166 --> 02:54:04.867
TO OPEN UP THEIR THEIR ABILITY

02:54:04.934 --> 02:54:06.302
TO ACCOMMODATE ACCESS.

02:54:06.369 --> 02:54:07.670
BUT I DON'T FORESEE THAT

02:54:07.737 --> 02:54:09.305
HAPPENING IN THE IMMEDIATE

02:54:09.372 --> 02:54:11.908
FUTURE AS YOU TESTIFIED IT'S A

02:54:11.974 --> 02:54:17.246
NEW WANTS THAT TAKES TIME.

02:54:17.313 --> 02:54:19.949
SO I WANT TO KEEP ACCESS OPEN.

02:54:20.016 --> 02:54:21.617
IT WAS IT WAS AT A FORM OF OF A

02:54:21.684 --> 02:54:22.585
QUESTION MISTER GRAYSON OR DO

02:54:22.652 --> 02:54:23.686
YOU KNOW IT WAS.

02:54:23.753 --> 02:54:24.620
OKAY WAS ALONG JUST FINE AND

02:54:24.687 --> 02:54:25.488
AGAIN IT I JUST WANT TO GET

02:54:25.555 --> 02:54:27.423
CLARIFICATION AND THE AUTHOR CAN

02:54:27.490 --> 02:54:28.758
ADDRESS WHICHEVER COMES THAT YOU

02:54:28.825 --> 02:54:29.659
WISH LIGHTNING IS CLOSE YOU KNOW

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:30.526
WHAT I THINK -- I THINK -- THE

02:54:30.593 --> 02:54:31.460
POINT THAT I BROUGHT UP ABOUT --

02:54:31.527 --> 02:54:32.461
THE INTENT OF LOCAL

02:54:32.528 --> 02:54:34.397
JURISDICTIONS IS IT IS IT YOUR

02:54:34.463 --> 02:54:35.932
INTENT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

02:54:35.998 --> 02:54:38.401
WOULD TAKE YOUR BILL AND USE IT

02:54:38.467 --> 02:54:40.203
FOR LOCAL CONTROL TO ALLOW.

02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:45.474
ACCESS -- TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

02:54:45.541 --> 02:54:46.108
I WANT TO JUMP ON THAT ACTUALLY

02:54:46.175 --> 02:54:46.909
ABSOLUTELY THAT WOULD BE MY

02:54:46.976 --> 02:54:48.377
INTENT.

02:54:48.444 --> 02:54:49.612
I THINK THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE IS

02:54:49.679 --> 02:54:51.013
THE AS WE PASSED A BALLOT

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:52.748
PROPOSITION.

02:54:52.815 --> 02:54:54.250
THIS SAYS THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT

02:54:54.317 --> 02:54:55.585
CHANGE EXCEPT TO FURTHER ITS

02:54:55.651 --> 02:54:57.053
INTENT.

02:54:57.119 --> 02:54:58.321
THE INTENT EXPRESSED IN THE

02:54:58.387 --> 02:54:59.755
BALLOT ARGUMENTS.

02:54:59.822 --> 02:55:01.724
IS LOCAL CONTROL.

02:55:01.791 --> 02:55:04.594
INDEED THE LA -- ANALYSIS SAYS.

02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:06.395
A PERSON CAN GET DELIVERY FROM

02:55:06.462 --> 02:55:08.097
THEIR LOCAL BUSINESS FROM THEIR

02:55:08.164 --> 02:55:09.866
BUSINESS.

02:55:09.932 --> 02:55:11.133
SO IT ACTUALLY THE BALLOT

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:12.535
ARGUMENT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR JULY

02:55:12.602 --> 02:55:14.170
DELIVERY IT CUT THE PLACE I HAVE

02:55:14.237 --> 02:55:15.171
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BRICKS

02:55:15.238 --> 02:55:17.006
AND MORTAR STORE.

02:55:17.073 --> 02:55:18.741
AND GET DELIVERY.

02:55:18.808 --> 02:55:20.710
SO BILLS THE PROPOSED A

02:55:20.776 --> 02:55:22.378
DIFFERENT DELIVERY MODEL.

02:55:22.445 --> 02:55:24.380
DON'T ALIGN WITH THE LANGUAGE OF

02:55:24.447 --> 02:55:25.114
THE PROPOSITION.

02:55:25.181 --> 02:55:25.748
DON'T LINE WITH THE

02:55:25.815 --> 02:55:27.083
REPRESENTATION THE PUBLIC IN THE

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:28.784
BALLOT ARGUMENTS.

02:55:28.851 --> 02:55:30.219
DON'T ALIGN WITH A JASON KENNEY

02:55:30.286 --> 02:55:31.654
WAS TELLING PEOPLE MONTHS BEFORE

02:55:31.721 --> 02:55:33.656
THE VOTE.

02:55:33.723 --> 02:55:36.125
SO THIS FACT WHICH I HAD NO

02:55:36.192 --> 02:55:38.461
PRIOR NOTICE OF THAT THE SERIES

02:55:38.527 --> 02:55:40.897
OF NOW SUIT ON THIS ISSUE.

02:55:40.963 --> 02:55:43.299
WHATEVER YOU THINK THE THE VIEWS

02:55:43.366 --> 02:55:44.367
THE MERITS OF DELIVERY.

02:55:44.433 --> 02:55:47.603
THERE NEEDS YOU NEED SOMEBODY.

02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:48.371
TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO

02:55:48.437 --> 02:55:50.006
RECONCILE THESE VIEWS WITHIN THE

02:55:50.072 --> 02:55:52.275
FRAMEWORK OF PROP SIXTY FOUR AND

02:55:52.341 --> 02:55:54.010
THE POLICY IN THIS AREA.

02:55:54.076 --> 02:55:55.344
AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SUBMITTED

02:55:55.411 --> 02:55:57.947
AB [inaudible]

02:55:58.014 --> 02:56:01.284
FIFTEEN THIRTY BECAUSE IT IS

02:56:01.350 --> 02:56:04.020
CLEARLY SUPPORTED LOCAL CONTROL.

02:56:04.086 --> 02:56:05.888
BUT JUST AS CLEARLY SUPPORTING

02:56:05.955 --> 02:56:08.357
MOVEMENT BY LOCALITIES TO GET

02:56:08.424 --> 02:56:09.292
INTO THIS BUSINESS OF ALLOWING

02:56:09.358 --> 02:56:10.459
IT.

02:56:10.526 --> 02:56:13.029
AND THEN POLICING A PROGRAM.

02:56:13.095 --> 02:56:14.330
IS THE PATH.

02:56:14.397 --> 02:56:15.665
THAT I THINK YOU START WORKING

02:56:15.731 --> 02:56:17.600
ON THINGS I WILL SAY.

02:56:17.667 --> 02:56:18.901
I COME OUT OF CITIES

02:56:18.968 --> 02:56:19.201
[inaudible]

02:56:19.268 --> 02:56:22.171
BUT YEAH.

02:56:22.238 --> 02:56:23.272
I ACTUALLY HAVE A STRONG

02:56:23.339 --> 02:56:25.541
CONNECTION.

02:56:25.608 --> 02:56:26.842
THE LEAGUE OF CITIES BECAUSE I

02:56:26.909 --> 02:56:28.844
BECAME A COUNCIL MEMBER NO.

02:56:28.911 --> 02:56:30.846
THREE ALL.

02:56:30.913 --> 02:56:31.981
FOR I'VE GOT ACT WITH THE LEAGUE

02:56:32.048 --> 02:56:34.083
OF CITIES AND BIO NINE I WAS

02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:36.085
FIRST VICE PRESIDENT STATEWIDE.

02:56:36.152 --> 02:56:37.453
I JUST MOVED TO THE RANKS OF THE

02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:38.287
LEAGUE.

02:56:38.354 --> 02:56:39.522
TOP LEADER I DIDN'T END UP

02:56:39.588 --> 02:56:40.923
TAKING THAT JOB BECAUSE I

02:56:40.990 --> 02:56:42.158
STEPPED AWAY FOR THAT BECAUSE OF

02:56:42.224 --> 02:56:44.260
THE NEW JOB FROM MY PERSONAL

02:56:44.327 --> 02:56:45.127
POINT.

02:56:45.194 --> 02:56:46.629
THAT DIDN'T FEELS COMPATIBLE.

02:56:46.696 --> 02:56:47.663
BUT SO I ACTUALLY FEEL I HAVE

02:56:47.730 --> 02:56:49.031
STRONG RELATIONS LEAGUE OF

02:56:49.098 --> 02:56:50.299
CITIES.

02:56:50.366 --> 02:56:51.467
I ALSO APPRECIATED PAUL SMITH

02:56:51.534 --> 02:56:53.402
BEING HERE.

02:56:53.469 --> 02:56:54.904
BECAUSE I REMEMBER SITTING IN

02:56:54.971 --> 02:56:57.440
JIM WOODS OFFICE IN TWENTY

02:56:57.506 --> 02:56:58.607
FIFTEEN HAVING A CONVERSATION

02:56:58.674 --> 02:57:00.142
ABOUT HOW THIS WILL ALL IN FULL.

02:57:00.209 --> 02:57:01.944
AND WAS IN THAT MEETING THAT I

02:57:02.011 --> 02:57:03.479
EXPRESSED THE VIEW WHICH I I

02:57:03.546 --> 02:57:04.647
BELIEVE IS THE PATH OUT OF THIS

02:57:04.714 --> 02:57:06.248
DILEMMA.

02:57:06.315 --> 02:57:08.351
WHICH IT CAN IT'S KIND OF A

02:57:08.417 --> 02:57:09.885
FUNNY ANALOGY.

02:57:09.952 --> 02:57:12.321
DECISIONAL MISTER SMITH IS GONNA

02:57:12.388 --> 02:57:12.888
BE LIKE WORLD WAR TWO IN THE

02:57:12.955 --> 02:57:15.257
PACIFIC.

02:57:15.324 --> 02:57:17.626
WE'RE GONNA MAKE HEADWAY.

02:57:17.693 --> 02:57:19.028
ON CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.

02:57:19.095 --> 02:57:20.629
AND OF OTHERS AREN'T THERE ON A

02:57:20.696 --> 02:57:22.164
ONE THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE AS WE

02:57:22.231 --> 02:57:23.899
MAKE HEADWAY THE PRADO HORRIBLE

02:57:23.966 --> 02:57:24.133
SCHOOL.

02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:25.868
DIMINISH IN PEOPLE'S MINDS WILL

02:57:25.935 --> 02:57:27.103
PICK UP ON THE JURISDICTION.

02:57:27.169 --> 02:57:29.605
I FEEL THAT IS THE WAY TO

02:57:29.672 --> 02:57:31.574
RECONCILE.

02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:32.842
THE LONG RUNNING POLICY THE

02:57:32.908 --> 02:57:34.810
STATE'S SUPPORTING LOCAL CONTROL

02:57:34.877 --> 02:57:37.747
THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROP.

02:57:37.813 --> 02:57:39.148
SIXTY FOUR WHAT THE BALLOT

02:57:39.215 --> 02:57:40.916
ARGUMENTS AFFIRMED WHAT THE LA

02:57:40.983 --> 02:57:44.020
OR FIRM. TO AVOID LITIGATION ALI

02:57:44.086 --> 02:57:45.988
WORK ON THAT THIS YEAR.

02:57:46.055 --> 02:57:47.656
BUT I I THAT THE PROBLEM I THINK

02:57:47.723 --> 02:57:49.692
YOU HAVE IS THAT YOU CANNOT PASS

02:57:49.759 --> 02:57:51.093
A BILL THAT GOES CONTRARY TO THE

02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:53.396
INTENT.

02:57:53.462 --> 02:57:53.963
AND THE RECORDS PRETTY DARN

02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:56.032
CLEAR.

02:57:56.098 --> 02:57:57.767
AND TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I'VE

02:57:57.833 --> 02:57:59.502
AYE AYE PROBLEM INCLINED TO KIND

02:57:59.568 --> 02:58:01.170
OF RIGHT OR NOT BAD AND PLACE IT

02:58:01.237 --> 02:58:01.470
SOMEWHERE.

02:58:01.537 --> 02:58:02.671
ESPECIALLY MY VIEW OF ALL OF

02:58:02.738 --> 02:58:03.739
THIS IF.

02:58:03.806 --> 02:58:04.740
IF I'M NOT AFFORDED THE

02:58:04.807 --> 02:58:05.841
OPPORTUNITY TO THE CONVERSATION

02:58:05.908 --> 02:58:08.444
THE CONTEXT OF AB [inaudible]

02:58:08.511 --> 02:58:11.147
FIFTEEN THIRTY BUT I SORT OF

02:58:11.213 --> 02:58:12.348
FEEL WERE AT A MOMENT LIKE WE

02:58:12.415 --> 02:58:13.816
WERE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHERE

02:58:13.883 --> 02:58:15.618
THIS COMMITTEE.

02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:18.521
BY A FIRM IN A GENERALIZED PATH.

02:58:18.587 --> 02:58:20.122
AT THE FIRST POLICY HEARING IN A

02:58:20.189 --> 02:58:21.257
TO HOUSE PROCESS AT LEAST THE

GOVERNOR'S DESK.

02:58:23.225 --> 02:58:24.760

CRISIS -- THE SAFE AND LEGAL AT

02:58:53.589 --> 02:58:54.623
A CANNABIS PROVIDES PEOPLE A

02:58:54.690 --> 02:58:57.326
DIFFERENT OPTION -- AS AS A

02:58:57.393 --> 02:58:59.028
VETERAN AND I WAS ALSO SOMEBODY

02:58:59.095 --> 02:59:00.096

AND THE AND THE FOUR OTHERS IN

02:59:33.329 --> 02:59:33.829
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND I I

02:59:33.896 --> 02:59:35.131
WORKED WITH YOU LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:59:35.197 --> 02:59:36.832
HERE AT SAKS CITY WE WERE WE

02:59:36.899 --> 02:59:37.867
WERE THE ROBUST CITY.

02:59:37.933 --> 02:59:39.735
THAT STEPPED UP AND LICENSE SO

02:59:39.802 --> 02:59:42.471
MANY THESE FACILITIES AND THAT'S

02:59:42.538 --> 02:59:43.906
ONE ONE OF MY CONCERNS I HAVE

02:59:43.973 --> 02:59:45.174
FOUR ISSUES I CAN'T VOTE FOR

02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:46.375
THIS BILL I WAS GONNA LET ME OUT

02:59:46.442 --> 02:59:47.743
FOR ISSUES.

02:59:47.810 --> 02:59:49.111
ONE IS THAT IS ACCESS.

02:59:49.178 --> 02:59:52.014
SACRAMENTO HAS STEPPED UP.

02:59:52.081 --> 02:59:53.449
IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS.

02:59:53.516 --> 02:59:56.051
AND BUT ALL AROUND US ARE THESE

02:59:56.118 --> 02:59:57.186
DESERT'S.

02:59:57.253 --> 02:59:59.355
A PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET ACCESS

02:59:59.421 --> 03:00:00.990
AND SO FRANKLY IT'S GREAT FOR

03:00:01.056 --> 03:00:05.261
SACRAMENTO BECAUSE OUR READ OUR

03:00:05.327 --> 03:00:06.228
TAX REVENUE FROM OUR SALES.

03:00:06.295 --> 03:00:07.796
OUR THROUGH THE CHARTS.

03:00:07.863 --> 03:00:08.330
THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO IS

03:00:08.397 --> 03:00:09.098
LITERALLY KILLING IT AS FAR AS

03:00:09.165 --> 03:00:09.965
BRINGING IN REVENUE.

03:00:10.032 --> 03:00:11.901
FROM MARIJUANA FROM THE

03:00:11.967 --> 03:00:13.502
MEDICINAL AND NOW FOR FROM FROM

03:00:13.569 --> 03:00:15.271
LEGAL USE.

03:00:15.337 --> 03:00:19.808
BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING.

03:00:19.875 --> 03:00:20.409
TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY

03:00:20.476 --> 03:00:21.177
SIXTY HUNDRED MILES TO GO FROM

03:00:21.243 --> 03:00:24.413
THEIR RESIDENCES TO SACRAMENTO.

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:26.315
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

03:00:26.382 --> 03:00:26.982
AND SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE

03:00:27.049 --> 03:00:28.817
ACCESS FOR TRANSPORTATION SO I

03:00:28.884 --> 03:00:30.219
JUST DON'T THINK.

03:00:30.286 --> 03:00:33.222
THAT MAKES SENSE -- THE TWO

03:00:33.289 --> 03:00:34.590
ISSUES I THINK ARE MOST

03:00:34.657 --> 03:00:35.524
IMPORTANT TO ME ARE FRANKLY ARE

03:00:35.591 --> 03:00:38.894
THE THAT THE HOW DO YOU BALANCE

03:00:38.961 --> 03:00:40.563
LOCAL CONTROL VERSES WILL THE

03:00:40.629 --> 03:00:41.664
VOTERS.

03:00:41.730 --> 03:00:42.998
SO I GET WE HAVE LOCAL CONTROL

03:00:43.065 --> 03:00:44.667
BUT WE ALSO HAVE.

03:00:44.733 --> 03:00:46.435
A BALLOT MEASURE ON A MAJOR

03:00:46.502 --> 03:00:47.570
CONVERSATION WITH ELECTION OF

03:00:47.636 --> 03:00:48.904
CALIFORNIA.

03:00:48.971 --> 03:00:49.972
AND THEY HAD SOME UNDERSTANDING

03:00:50.039 --> 03:00:51.006
AS FAR AS WHAT THEY WOULD BE

03:00:51.073 --> 03:00:52.341
ABLE TO ACCESS IN THEIR

03:00:52.408 --> 03:00:54.176
COMMUNITIES AND SO.

03:00:54.243 --> 03:00:55.110
YOU CAN HAVE A COMMUNITY WHERE

03:00:55.177 --> 03:00:57.346
IT A CITY WHERE THE VOTERS SAID

03:00:57.413 --> 03:00:58.147
70%.

03:00:58.214 --> 03:01:00.349
YES WE WE WANT TO HAVE THIS

03:01:00.416 --> 03:01:01.483
LEGALIZING ONE HAVE ACCESS AND

03:01:01.550 --> 03:01:03.319
LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD GO.

03:01:03.385 --> 03:01:04.853
THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:06.722
AND THEN THE THE LAST THING IS

03:01:06.789 --> 03:01:08.023
IS BY HAVING MORE JURISDICTIONS

03:01:08.090 --> 03:01:09.658
SHUT IT DOWN.

03:01:09.725 --> 03:01:13.295
THAT JUST MEANS FEWER DOLLARS --

03:01:13.362 --> 03:01:14.797
FOR THANK YOU TAXES COMING INTO

03:01:14.863 --> 03:01:15.264
CALIFORNIA.

03:01:15.331 --> 03:01:16.665
FEW OPPORTUNE A REGULATE THIS

03:01:16.732 --> 03:01:18.867
MARKET AND FURTHER PERPETUATES

03:01:18.934 --> 03:01:20.302
THE LEGAL MARKET SO I'M NOT SURE

03:01:20.369 --> 03:01:21.570
HOW THIS REALLY HELPS THESE

03:01:21.637 --> 03:01:22.972
ISSUES WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS

03:01:23.038 --> 03:01:24.273
AND CAL THE PROBLEM IS KEVIN

03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:24.473
THAT.

03:01:24.540 --> 03:01:27.276
PURSUANT TO THE BALLOT

03:01:27.343 --> 03:01:28.944
PROPOSITION.

03:01:29.011 --> 03:01:30.045
LOCAL IT ALLOWS LOW COVERS TO

03:01:30.112 --> 03:01:30.546
BAN ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA

03:01:30.613 --> 03:01:32.881
BUSINESSES.

03:01:32.948 --> 03:01:34.350
SO SO THE ISSUE IS.

03:01:34.416 --> 03:01:36.485
THIS POWER TO BAN IS WITHIN THE

03:01:36.552 --> 03:01:38.420
EXPRESS.

03:01:38.487 --> 03:01:40.389
UNDERSTAND THE VOTERS.

03:01:40.456 --> 03:01:41.757
SO WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS A

03:01:41.824 --> 03:01:43.592
STRATEGY TO INDUCE COMPANIES GET

03:01:43.659 --> 03:01:45.527
OFF A BIT.

03:01:45.594 --> 03:01:47.429
WHICH IS THIS BILL BY A FIRM AND

03:01:47.496 --> 03:01:49.331
THEY HAVE LOCAL CONTROL BUT GIVE

03:01:49.398 --> 03:01:51.400
THEM AN INCENTIVE. TO MOVE OUT

03:01:51.467 --> 03:01:53.135
OF THAT POSITION.

03:01:53.202 --> 03:01:56.338
THE PROBLEM IS THE VOTERS.

03:01:56.405 --> 03:01:58.641
AUTHORIZED THESE BANDS IT'S NOT

03:01:58.707 --> 03:02:00.242
CONTRARY.

03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:02.578
IT'S A LINE WITH.

03:02:02.645 --> 03:02:05.914
AND SO YOU HAVE SORT OF A YOUR

03:02:05.981 --> 03:02:07.883
YOUR YOU HAVE A LITTLE CONUNDRUM.

03:02:07.950 --> 03:02:10.486
HOW DO YOU BACK UP?

03:02:10.552 --> 03:02:15.424
WHEN THE VOTERS AUTHORIZED BANDS?

03:02:15.491 --> 03:02:17.192
AND THEN THE BAND BECAME THE

03:02:17.259 --> 03:02:18.994
EXPEDIENT WAY TO GET A LOCAL

03:02:19.061 --> 03:02:20.529
POLICY OF PLACE TO RESERVE LOCAL

03:02:20.596 --> 03:02:22.298
CONTROL.

03:02:22.364 --> 03:02:24.433
YOU NEED A PATH TO ENGAGE IN A

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:27.503
CONVERSATION. TO JUST HAVE

03:02:27.569 --> 03:02:28.570
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT BANDS ARE

03:02:28.637 --> 03:02:30.306
NOT.

03:02:30.372 --> 03:02:32.107
THE PRODUCTIVE LONG TERM ROUTE.

03:02:32.174 --> 03:02:33.776
WE'VE INVESTED A RESEARCH AT UC

03:02:33.842 --> 03:02:35.711
SAN DIEGO.

03:02:35.778 --> 03:02:37.413
THE MEDICAL CANNABIS RESEARCH

03:02:37.479 --> 03:02:39.081
INSTITUTE WHICH DOCUMENTS ITS

03:02:39.148 --> 03:02:41.050
UTILITY FOR EPILEPSY.

03:02:41.116 --> 03:02:43.285
AND OTHER PURPOSES WE HAVE A LOT

03:02:43.352 --> 03:02:44.386
OF KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE.

03:02:44.453 --> 03:02:46.755
AND WE HAVE [inaudible]

03:02:46.822 --> 03:02:51.293
THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHICH OUR

03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:53.128
DOCUMENT THAT YOU CAN THESE ARE

03:02:53.195 --> 03:02:55.130
COMPATIBLE THEY DO NOT DESTROY

03:02:55.197 --> 03:02:56.465
COMMITTEE QUALITY OF LIFE.

03:02:56.532 --> 03:02:58.267
THERE'S REASONABLE PROCEDURES IN

03:02:58.334 --> 03:03:00.035
PLACE THE LOCAL.

03:03:00.102 --> 03:03:01.837
JOHN D'ARMES THE POLICE CAN

03:03:01.904 --> 03:03:03.706
OPERATE COMPATIBLE IN CHECK ON

03:03:03.772 --> 03:03:06.575
ENFORCEMENT ALL OF THIS IS.

03:03:06.642 --> 03:03:08.143
IT'S KINDA WORKING HIS WAY OUT

03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:10.212
ITS THIS EXAMPLE OF YOU GET YOUR

03:03:10.279 --> 03:03:12.414
BE CHAD JURISDICTIONS.

03:03:12.481 --> 03:03:13.882
AND THEN YOU.

03:03:13.949 --> 03:03:16.785
EDUCATE OTHER JURISDICTIONS ON

03:03:16.852 --> 03:03:17.820
EASE UP.

03:03:17.886 --> 03:03:20.556
AND THIS MY APPROACH REFLEXIS

03:03:20.622 --> 03:03:21.990
LONG TERM STRATEGY SUPPORT LOCAL

03:03:22.057 --> 03:03:24.460
CONTROL.

03:03:24.526 --> 03:03:26.929
BUT INDUCE LONG TERM MOVED.

DISPENSARIES WHERE IS THIS BILL

03:03:59.128 --> 03:04:00.829

TO A BILL PROPOSAL TO LOWER THE

03:04:06.602 --> 03:04:08.070
TAX.

03:04:08.137 --> 03:04:09.471
TAXATION OF CANNABIS THE

03:04:09.538 --> 03:04:11.140
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH

A YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS OR SO

03:04:16.311 --> 03:04:17.946
INTO LEGALIZATION.

03:04:18.013 --> 03:04:20.716
IS THIS WEIRD MARRIED OF VARIOUS

03:04:20.783 --> 03:04:22.184
REGULATORY BODIES WHETHER IT BE

03:04:22.251 --> 03:04:23.419

03:04:27.423 --> 03:04:28.457
HOW DO WE HAVE A HOLISTIC

03:04:28.524 --> 03:04:29.958
APPROACH TO WHAT WE WANT TO DO

THE REGULATED MARKET?

03:04:33.695 --> 03:04:36.532
AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE TO

03:04:36.598 --> 03:04:37.099
STAMP OUT THAT OF THE BLACK

03:04:37.166 --> 03:04:37.666
MARKET.

03:04:37.733 --> 03:04:40.402
WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE
