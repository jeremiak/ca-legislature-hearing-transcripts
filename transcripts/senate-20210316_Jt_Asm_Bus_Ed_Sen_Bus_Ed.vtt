00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:27.697
THE PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS TO

00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:28.698
MAKE SURE THAT. YOU HAVE THE

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:30.266
RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED AND

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:31.101
THAT THE SYSTEM IS SET UP

00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:32.969
PROPERLY- BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:35.338
THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY- IS. IT

00:54:35.405 --> 00:54:36.806
AND THE FOCUS IS WHERE IT

00:54:36.873 --> 00:54:37.807
SHOULD BE. WHICH IS ON

00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:39.743
PROTECTING STUDENTS. WHO IN

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:40.877
CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.779
COUNTRY FAR TOO OFTEN. FIND

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:43.647
THEMSELVES BEING TAKEN

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:46.082
ADVANTAGE OF- BYE BYE PREDATORY

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:47.784
AND UNSCRUPULOUS- PRIVATE

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:49.452
PERFECT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES.

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:51.121
SOME ARE GREAT. AND SOME ARE

00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:52.789
NOT- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:54:52.856 --> 00:54:54.090
HAVE THE DATA NECESSARY TO BE

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.492
ABLE TO EVALUATE WHICH ONES ARE

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:56.926
WHICH- AND THEN WITH THAT WE

00:54:56.993 --> 00:54:59.596
HAVE THE REGULATIONS AND LAWS.

00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:01.631
NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO

00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:03.033
PROPERLY REGULATE THOSE THAT

00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:05.068
ARE MISBEHAVING. SO I WAS

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:07.137
ENCOURAGED TO SEE. ONE OF THE

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:08.171
BIGGER ISSUES THAT CAME UP A

00:55:08.238 --> 00:55:09.539
LOT WAS THE NUMBER OF THE

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:11.441
BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS- AND I

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:13.043
WAS ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT THE

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:14.878
NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. HAS

00:55:14.944 --> 00:55:15.912
DECREASED BY ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:18.048
PERCENT- BUT I WAS DISCOURAGED

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:20.216
TO SEE. THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE

00:55:20.283 --> 00:55:22.652
COMPLAINTS. WERE CLOSE BECAUSE

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:23.420
THE COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.288
SUBSTANTIATED. OR THE BUREAU

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:26.723
DETERMINED IT DID NOT HAVE

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.958
JURISDICTION- SO I GUESS ONE

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.160
QUESTION IS. WHAT'S THE

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:31.695
BREAKDOWN HOW MANY WORDS WERE

00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:33.096
CLOSED BECAUSE THE COMPLAINT

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:34.631
COULD NOT BE SUBSTANTIATED. HOW

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:36.366
MANY WERE CLOSE BECAUSE- THE

00:55:36.433 --> 00:55:37.567
BUREAU ARE DETERMINED THAT IT

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:39.269
DID NOT HAVE JURISDICTION- WHAT

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.705
WAS THE PROCESS. FOR COMING UP

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:43.373
WITH THOSE DETERMINATIONS. AND

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.008
DOES THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:50.814
PROVIDE- EXPAND THE SCOPE. OF

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.614
THE BUREAU'S RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:54.484
TO ALLOW IT TO- INVESTIGATE

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:55.652
MORE THESE COMPLAINTSTHAT IT

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.487
DETERMINED THEY DON'T HAVE

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:58.054
JURISDICTION YOU DON'T HAVE

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:02.959

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:37.026
INDISPOSED CASES THAT CAME

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:39.729
FORWARD ABOUT 90% OF THEM WERE

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:42.132
ACTUALLY NONTRADITIONAL WHERE

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:44.467
THEY WERE CLOSED COOL OR- AND

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:45.635
WHEN THAT HAPPENED WE WOULD

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:47.237
REFER THE MATTER ON. CORRECT

00:56:47.303 --> 00:56:48.438
THAT'S ONE THING WE WERE GOING

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.540
THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND JUST

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:51.674
TO GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.443
BACKGROUND ON THE ACTUALLY HAD

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:54.878
IT YEP I CRACKED I DIDN'T KNOW

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:55.945
THAT THAT'S THE CASE IN FRONT

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:57.046
OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER

00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:59.582

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:01.885
THE GOOD THAT WERE AT AT. LEVEL

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:03.887
OF INVESTIGATOR WHERE THEY BOTH

00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:06.456
WENT IN AND EVALUATED THE- AND

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:07.957
WHAT THEY REALLY DID IT ALSO

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:09.359
WHILE THEY WERE DOING THEIR

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:10.794
EVALUATIONS THEY WERE ACTING

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.195
TRAINING BUT BASS. AND

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:14.364
ASSISTING THEM AND BEING ABLE

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.765
TO REVIEW PAPERS AND MAKE

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.901
CHANGES THAT THEY WENT FORWARD.

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.269
AND SO WHEN THEY WENT THROUGH

00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:20.303
AND LOOKED AT THE CASE WITH THE

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.639
ULTIMATE LIKE THAT- INFORMATION

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:24.674
THAT THEY HAVE SO 90% OF THOSE

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:27.177
WORKLOADS. HOLD WORLD AND SO

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:29.145
THEY REFERRED A PATIENT OVER TO

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:30.380
STRICTER THEY COULD REACH OUT

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:32.448
TO STUDENTS AND ASSESS THEM ON

00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:32.982
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:34.317
COULDN'T TAKE ACTION AGAINST

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:35.819
THE SCHOOL THERE WERE STILL

00:57:35.885 --> 00:57:37.053
STUDENTS THAT WERE HARMED AND

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.088
POTENTIALLY IN NEED OF FILING A

00:57:39.155 --> 00:57:40.590
CLAIM SO THAT'S WHAT THEY GET.

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:41.891
THERE WERE ALSO THOSE THAT

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.827
WE'RE NOT PERFECT ABOUT 12% OF

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.195
THOSE THAT WERE REFERRED TO

00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:48.431
ANOTHER AGENCY I'M AT BECAUSE

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:49.666
THEY'VE WORKED ON THIRD BEAT

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:52.869
THAT- OR THEY WERE EXACT- YOU

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:55.405
HE SAID FOR EXAMPLE- BOTH OF

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:57.240
WERE. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:59.709
BOTH WERE 13% BOTH BOTH WORK

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:16.392
WELL BECAUSE. I'M WHILE THEY

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:23.900
MADE. THE ISSUE IS WORRIED THAT

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.168
WHEN THY WERE LOOKING AT THE

00:58:25.235 --> 00:58:27.470
INFORMATION FROM UNIT THAT HAD

00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:29.105
BEEN PROMOTED FROM ABOUT WHAT

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:30.473
OLD THOSE WHO ARE REQUIRED TO

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.442
KEEP INFORMATION FOR OVER FIVE

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:34.077
YEARS AND THEY HAD WAITED FOR

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:35.044
EITHER FILED A COMPLAINT

00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:37.080
WORKING ON MY- OR IT'S BEEN

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:39.549
PENDING WITH. ZERO IF IT DIDN'T

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:41.351
MEET THAT CRITERIA WHAT. THE

00:58:41.417 --> 00:58:43.419
TEAM DID IF THEY LOOKED AT OKAY

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:44.854
IF THEY'RE FROM OTHER AVENUES

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:46.122
THAT WE CAN'T TAKE ACTION RIGHT

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.757
NOW BE ON FACE ON THIS

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:49.592
COMPLAINT. WE FOR THE OVER FOR

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.494
A COMPLIANCE INSPECTION WE

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:53.129
ADDED TO THE INFORMATION THAT'S

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.131
GOING TO BE GIVEN- UP FOR

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:57.567
FUTURE REVIEW OF THAT WELL AS

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:59.369
BOTH INDIVIDUAL GO OUT. THE

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:00.470
OTHER THING THAT THEY DID SOME

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:01.504
OF THEM ARE CRIMINAL MATTERS

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:03.072
AND SO THEY REPORT THEM ON FOR

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:05.208
CRIMINAL ON ACTION AND THEN IF

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.843
THAT ENTITY TOOK ACTION TO GET

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:07.510
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:08.378
INSURANCE THAT THEY COULD

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:09.579
HAPPEN THEN IT WOULD BE

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:10.914
SOMETHING THAT THE FEAR WOULD

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.548
BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ON. AND

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:13.950
THE OTHER THING THAT THEY DID

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.418
SOME OF THAT STUDENT PAPERS

00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:17.353
THAT WORK THEY WERE LOOKING OUT

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.655
BECAUSE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:20.290
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT THAT

00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:22.225
LARGE NUMBER SOME OF THEM ONCE

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.359
THEY STARTED CRAWLING BUT

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:24.560
STUDENTS. THEY HAD ACTUALLY

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:27.230
ALREADY BEEN- BROUGHT MADE

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.799
WHOLE BASICALLY SO- THAT THEY

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:31.134
NEED WITH MATHEMATICS IN EITHER

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.069
THEIR PRACTICAL BEEN PROVIDED

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:34.837
OR THEY WERE WERE WE INVOLVED

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:36.105
KIND OF THINGS HAPPEN SO THAT

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:37.440
PRICING PLANT SO THEY WERE ABLE

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:39.742
TO BE CLOSE COMPLAINTS OF PAIN.

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:41.210
AND THEN THE LAST THING THAT

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:43.579
THEY GET IT IN A LOT OF THE

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:45.381
PAPERS THAT COMPLAINTS THAT

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:46.249
WERE PROVIDED THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.184
ENOUGH INFORMATION TO BE LOOKED

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:50.753
AT- AND SO THEY THEY TRIED TO

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:51.955
CONTACT THE STUDENTS A LOT OF

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:53.423
THE STUDENTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE

00:59:53.489 --> 00:59:54.590
THEY DID WHAT THEY COULD IN

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:56.159
LOOKING AT WILL RECORD BUT IF

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:57.427
THEY HAD IDENTIFIED A TEACHER

00:59:57.493 --> 00:59:58.461
THAT WAS A PROBLEM OR THINGS

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.029
LIKE THAT. THEY LOOK AT THE

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.998
POLL RECORDS TO TRY TO IDENTIFY

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:04.033
THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND IF THEY

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.034
WEREN'T ABLE TO THEY DID HAVE

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:06.235
TO CLOSE THE CASE BECAUSE THERE

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:07.503
WAS NO OTHER ACTIVITY THAT

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:10.039
COULD BE TAKEN. SO I LOOKED AT

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:11.474
THAT I'VE I'VE MET WITH THE

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.476
GRANDMOTHER THEIR STAFF POPULAR

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:14.978
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE GONE

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:17.246
THROUGH THAT PROCESS- I AND I

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:19.449
DO BELIEVE THAT THEY- ARE.

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:36.899
APPROPRIATELY ANALYZE. AND

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:41.871
REVIEW THOSE PAPERS. AND THEN

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:42.638
THE INFORMATION THAT WE

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.307
PROVIDED THAT WE BELIEVE THAT

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:45.375
THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:47.043
STRENGTHENED I'M BACK ONE OF

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.678
THEM WE BELIEVE THAT IT NEEDS

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:49.846
TO BE ALLOWED TO EVEN IF

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.347
THEY'RE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:53.349
HAVE. YOU KNOW I'M PRUDENT IT

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:55.184
HAD TO BE A POTENTIAL PERSON ON

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.619
LIKE OUR OTHER PORTLAND BUREAUS

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:57.587
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.489
CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND THEN WE

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:00.890
ALSO HAVE A CASE IN THE BACK ON

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.959
PAPER OTHER AREAS WHERE WE NEED

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.227
PEOPLE THEY'RE GETTING APPROVED

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:06.129
OTHER PLACES WHERE WE NEED TO

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:07.764
HAVE- STRONGER LAWS AND

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:12.668
REGULATIONS AND SO THAT'S. WHY

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:13.302
WE REALLY WANT TO PARTNER WITH.

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:14.570
AND LOOKING AT WAYS THAT. THAT

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:17.206
THERE ARE- ENFORCEMENT AND I DO

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.742
WANNA- IT'S A GREAT IF HE-

THE- OF THE BPP- IN MY

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.555
UNDERSTANDING AND CERTAINLY AND

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:54.257
THE CENTRAL VALLEY- THESE

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:55.791
INSTITUTES ON A NUMBER OF THESE

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.860

INCREASES ARE SO SUBSTANTIAL-

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:33.062
WHY THEY'RE NECESSARY-

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:34.697

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:45.101
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX- THEY HAVE

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.236
INDIVIDUAL APPLICATION FEES AND

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.671

ANNUAL FEE THAT IS BASICALLY-

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:01.117
MADE FUN A PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.184
ANNUAL REVENUE RECEIVED FROM

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.387

THAT WE THOUGHT GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:38.087
AND BASED ON SCHOOL. BECAUSE IT

ON WE WORK ABLE TO THAT.

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.566
REVENUES WE THOUGHT IN ONE OF

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:51.934

YEAR. AND THEN THE LAST THING

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:45.975
IMPACT WITH THEM REALLY IT'S

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.242
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW I

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:48.677
KEEP. THAT WAS ANOTHER THING

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:52.214
THAT IN THAT. ALL OF THAT WE IN

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.082

AMOUNT OF THEIR X. AND LOT OF

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:57.820
IT IS OF THEIR- WHAT HAVE THEY

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.722
DONE BABY WILL AT. THAT ARE IN

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:05.060
WHAT WE THEIR. AND SOME OF

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:06.528
THOSE THINGS IN. THAT THEY'D

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:08.530
LOOK AT IT THEY SAY AND ACT HAD

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:09.865
TO LOOK AT BECAUSE THE COLD IN

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:14.670
MY- WHAT ARE. COSTS WHERE CAN

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:18.440
FIND THE- WITH. WITH ME IN A-

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:21.410
AND WITH THE POPE SOUTH HAVE

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:22.778
THE WORD GOING MORE ONLINE

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:25.814
THEREFORE WE CAN FIND. AND ALL

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:32.988
LOOKING OTHER. THE OTHER THING

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.890
AND IT IT WON'T HAPPEN QUICKLY

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.325
BECAUSE THEY JUST RECENTLY BUT

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:38.827
IN THE FUTURE LET'S LOOK AT

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:41.130
BOTH WE- WORK BUT- NOBODY

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:41.797
CLAPPED BECAUSE NOW WITH

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.232
HOMEWORK I THINK WE CAN CUT

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:45.601
DOWN ON OUR OUR PHYSICAL. TO

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.202
WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:11:47.269 --> 01:11:48.971
LOWER RENT ALL OF THESE THINGS

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:51.774
ARE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.008
THINGS THAT ARE UNDER THEIR

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.276
CONTROL THE SALARIES AND OTHER

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:55.878
ENTITIES INCREASING FAT IT'S

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:57.646
NOT AND SO THAT'S WHY IT FITS

01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:59.481
POINT THERE IS THAT NEEDED BE

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:01.650
INCREASE TO BASIC CONTINUE TO

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:08.657
FALL BEFORE THAT. SO I COULD

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:11.126
APPLY UP I GUESS I HEARING.

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.394
THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT ARE.

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:14.129
ADAM AN OUT OF THE CAN. OF

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:16.665
THESE AND SEE- AND I'M OF THE

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.067

REVENUES OF THE RAISING FEES

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:23.439
BUT THEN. WHAT THE INSTITUTIONS

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:25.841
CAN CONTROL IS VERY LIMITED.

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:28.010
AND SO I GUESS YOU KNOW. UP I

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:29.211
CAN SEE LIKE A FOR EXAMPLE I

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.413

I THINK THAT- I'M SEEING A

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:33.328
RECIPE FOR DISASTER WE HAVE.

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.396
THE LEGISLATURE WHO IS. BLARING

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:36.798
ON MORE. ON THIS ON THIS. WE

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:37.799
HAVE AN ANTIQUATED COMPUTER

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:39.268
SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE.

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.036

SEE A MASSIVE FEE INCREASE-

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:46.808

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:49.811
MODEL. AND I JUST ENCOURAGE

AT THAT VERY. VERY CLOSELY-

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:57.085
BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:58.487
SUSTAINABILITY ONLY TALK ABOUT.

THE SUNSET REVIEW PAPER LIST

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:15.837
THE CATEGORIES OF THE CURRENT

pINCREASE. IN FACT I HAD TO GO

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.977
TO ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE STAFF

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:22.577
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE MATH WAS

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:26.114
INCORRECT- BUT FOR EXAMPLE- ON

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:28.317
THAT'S FROMTHE TOP. FIVE DOWN

01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:29.885

ACCREDITATION. THE CURRENT FEE

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:35.290
IS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.726
THE NEW FEE IS TEN THOUSAND

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.861
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. A ONE

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:40.462
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND 9%

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:43.198
INCREASE. AGAIN I THOUGHT THAT

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:45.300
THAT NUMBER WAS WAS INCORRECT

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:47.402
BUT I WAS TOLD THAT THAT'S-

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:49.471
THAT IT WAS FACTUAL OR IT TO

01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:52.174
SEE BELOW THAT A SEVEN HUNDRED

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.344
AND 17% INCREASE. OR EVEN LOWER

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.345
THE FIVE HUNDRED AND 11%

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:57.946
INCREASE AS I THINK YOU YOU'D

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:59.548

NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES THAT

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:08.323
ARE. THE REAL CONCERN ABOUT

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:09.324
THESE FEE INCREASES ESPECIALLY

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:11.159
TIMES OF THE COVERT PANDEMIC

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:12.361
THAT WE FEEL LIKE THAT MIGHT BE

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:14.496
SOME- THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:15.630
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THAT

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.432
MIGHT BE A LITTLE TONE DEAF- SO

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:18.900
WE WELCOME IN AND SOME OF THE

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.702
OTHER REMARKS AS WELL TOO BUT

ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE COULD

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:20.495
HELP THE BUREAU- IN ITS MINIMUM

01:28:20.561 --> 01:28:21.863
OPERATING STANDARDS AND SOME

DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:32.040
THE ROOM WHERE AT PLACE WHERE

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.307
THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:35.209
AND ROOM FOR ACCEPTANCE FROM

THE LEGISLATURE AND I CAN HAVE

01:28:36.811 --> 01:28:38.212

OPERATING STANDARDS AROUND AND

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:58.399
EAT THE CHARGES THAT THE

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.268
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:01.569
CHARGING THE STUDENTS IN THE

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:03.037
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IS IT IN

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:05.339
LINE WITH THE CURRENT CHARGES

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:08.876
AND OTHER- OTHER INSTITUTIONS I

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.678
JUST DIDN'T PAINT TO MATCH HER.

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:16.284
IN IN ONE AREA. ADDITIONALLY-

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:19.353
WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.355
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ENROLL

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:23.591
INTO A PROGRAM IS APPROPRIATE

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:26.461
IS THERE ENOUGH EQUIPMENT IS

THERE ARE ENOUGH TEACHERS AND

01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:30.765
SO FORTH TO ENSURE THAT THOSE

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:31.733
STUDENTS ARE GONNA GET THE

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:32.734
OUTCOME THAT THEY'RE PAYING

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.904
FOR. AND THE OTHER SECTION IS

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:39.340
THAT THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:42.577
ARE BEING EVALUATED FOR THEIR

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:46.013
EFFECTIVENESS. WE I WANT TO

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.949
MAKE SURE THAT THE READER AND

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:51.652
THE PROGRAM IS SUFFICIENT- YOU

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:54.021
KNOW WE HAVE THE SCHOOL

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:55.823
DEPARTMENT FACT SHEET THAT THE

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:58.893
SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.562
YET THERE'S NO STANDARDS FOR

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:03.097
THOSE DIFFERENT TACK SHEET-

01:30:03.164 --> 01:30:07.101
COMPLETION RATE GRADUATION RATE-

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:09.270
PLACEMENT RATE OR- EXAMINATION

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:10.805
RIGHT. SO THOSE ARE DIFFERENT

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:12.340
THINGS THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:13.574
LOOKING AT THAT WOULD HELP THAT

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:16.444
STRENGTHENS THE EDUCATIONAL

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:18.513
PROGRAM. ANY BUT I THOUGHT

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:20.515
REGULATIONS THAT MAY BE NEEDED

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.250

WERE MENTIONED I THINK-

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:30.491
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MAKING

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.293
SURE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS WHEN

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.261

01:30:33.327 --> 01:30:35.363
THE- UNNECESSARY ITEMS TO BE

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:37.498

01:30:44.806 --> 01:30:46.541
COLLEGES COULD FILL SOME OF THE

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:49.243
GAPS THAT WE SEE WITH OUR POST

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:51.679

01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:54.782
LOT OF WORK ON OUR COMMUNITY

01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:56.284

QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WITH ANY

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:43.724
OPETH MY HEAD THAT HAVE

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:44.892
ACTUALLY LOST THEIR CREDIT

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:47.461
ASIAN- I BELIEVE WE'VE HAD A

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:50.197
COUPLE. AND INSTITUTIONS THAT

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:51.532
WERE NOT DISCLOSED EDUCATION

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.100
O'CLOCK THEIR CREDIT ASIAN

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:55.069

CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT

01:32:57.538 --> 01:32:59.173
I BELIEVE WE HAD PEOPLE THAT

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.509
HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SO- DURING

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:03.077
THE PANDEMIC LIKE PERMANENTLY

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:05.680
CLOSED OTHERS HUNDRED RECALLS

01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:07.281
THAT EVERYONE CAN'T FIFTY

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:08.349
SCHOOL BOARD NINE PEOPLE THE

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:10.084
HAD TO CLOSE. I THINK IN PART

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:11.218
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:12.954
BUT THEN ALSO SOME OF THE WILL

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.055
BUT MENTIONS THAT THEY

01:33:14.121 --> 01:33:16.490
ACTUALLY- WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:18.025
AT CLOSING ANYWAY THEY HAD

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:19.427
OTHER ISSUES COME UP AND THAT'S

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:20.761
THE KIND OF WHAT THAT THE

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:22.697
LAUGH- HE SAID THAT THE PUZZLE

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:24.432
THAT PUTS THEM OVER THE EDGE.

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:26.133
WHEN SOME OF THOSE SCHOOLS A

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.636
DECIDED TO CLOSE FOR OTHER

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:31.072
REASONS OTHER THAN A PANDEMIC-

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:32.340
HOW HAVE THOSE HAVE THOSE

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:34.342
STUDENTS BEEN. HOW THOSE

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.043
STUDENTS HOW'S THAT BEING

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:37.378
HANDLED WITH THE WHAT IT COMES

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:39.046
DOWN TO THOSE SCHOOLS CLOSING

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.982
AND THOSE STUDENTS. THAT MAY

01:33:41.048 --> 01:33:45.219
HAVE LOANS THERE AND OR-

01:52:39.252 --> 01:52:41.121
THE CREATION OF THIS ENTITY WAS

01:52:41.187 --> 01:52:42.222
THE FACT THAT STUDENTS ARE

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:43.523

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:45.525
PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS FOR

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:47.260
WHATEVER AND NOT NECESSARILY

01:52:47.327 --> 01:52:49.229
RECEIVING THE BENEFIT THAT THEY

01:52:49.295 --> 01:52:50.964
THOUGHT THEY WERE PROMISED.

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:52.632
WHICH I ASSUME IN THE CASE OF

JUST ABOUT EVERY STUDENT WHO'S

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.201
PAYMENT WHO PAYS MONEY FOR

01:52:55.268 --> 01:52:57.437
EDUCATION IS A GOOD PAYING JOB

01:52:57.504 --> 01:52:58.838
IN THE FIELD THAT THEY SEEK THE

01:52:58.905 --> 01:53:04.043

TRAINED BY THAT SCHOOL. THAT IS

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:22.929
PART OF THE PART BACKSHEET

01:53:22.996 --> 01:53:24.797

THE PROPOSED FEE INCREASES ARE

01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:20.606
ACTUALLY NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP THE

THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS SUCH ARE

02:01:00.353 --> 02:01:01.887
ATTRACTIVE SURVIVE AND THAT

02:01:01.954 --> 02:01:02.989
THEY CANNOT AND THEY KEEP ON

AND EVENTUALLY SB ALL MAY NOT

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:16.936
BE- YOU KNOW SARPANCH STAYS ARE

02:01:17.003 --> 02:01:18.971
WANT AND IN THE FUTURE SO THEY

02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:21.007
WERE I THINK A HAS TO BE WISE

02:01:21.073 --> 02:01:23.643
TO HAVE. SOME BASIC EVALUATION

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:25.344
