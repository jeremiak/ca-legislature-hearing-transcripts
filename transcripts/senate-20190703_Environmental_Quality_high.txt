YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- FIRSTLY TO START BY THANKING ALL OF REPEAT MYSELF OVER THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WE GOT BUT JUST A FEW IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH US ALL ARE. ALL OUR BILLS -- THIS IS A BILL THAT IS WE BELIEVE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. AT USE ARE ONE OF THE FASTEST MOST AFFORDABLE WAY TO BUILD HOUSING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. DOESN'T CREATE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DENSITY IN A CONFORMS TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THE SAME TIME THEY'RE BUILT BY. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SO WE THINK IT'S ONE OF THE FASTEST WAYS THAT WE CAN SEE DEVELOPMENT. THIS BILL REALLY STREAMLINES A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS IN STATE LAW TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIES CANNOT -- ALLEY HAVE ARBITRARY SQUARE FOOTAGE OR LOT SIZES IN ORDERTO RESTRICT A TO USE IT ALSO STREAMLINES EIGHTY USE THAT ARE ON A TWO EIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET AS WELL AS JUNIOR EIGHTY USE UP. TO FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET -- WITH THAT WE HAVE -- ONE WITNESS ASK HIM TO PRESENT IF THAT'S OKAY. LOUIS BRONTE WITH THE ACT CALIFORNIA ME THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS. WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT AB SIXTY EIGHT BECAUSE EIGHTY USE COST LESS TO BUILD AND TO RENT THEN COMMENCE HERBAL -- MARKET RATE UNITS ACCORDING TO RESTRICT RESEARCH AT UC BERKELEY THEY CAN BE A NATURALLY OCCURRING SOURCE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THEY CAN STABILIZE HOMEOWNERS NOW WHO ARE FEELING THE PINCH OF CALIFORNIA'S IMMENSE HOUSING CRISIS. I AB SIXTY IS IMPORTANT IT BUILDS UP SUCCESSFUL STATE LEGISLATION. ENACTED IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA IS SPECIALLY LA HAVE SEEN REAL LARGE INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF THEIR EIGHTY YOU PERMITS WHICH ARE SMALL INFILL HOUSING AND TYPICALLY VERY ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY -- THIS -- THIS BILL BILLS OFF THE SUCCESS -- IN THOSE COMMUNITIES -- CARRYING SOME OF THOSE LESSONS FORWARD I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. YOUR VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL S.. TODAY THE BAY AREA HOUSING ADVOCACY COALITION STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

GOOD MORNING SYLVIA FOR HIM TO HAVE A FACEBOOK IN SUPPORT. FOR SO I CAN JUST HEAR ON BEHALF LESS INTERESTED AMERICA. IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT I DO WANT TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL RAISE CONCERNS. GOOD MORNING CARE AWESOME BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF BURBANK SAN MARCOS MARIN COUNTY COUNCIL BEERS ACCOUNTS MEMBERS WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE BILL BUT WE STILL REMAIN CONCERNED. ABOUT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE'S A LOOPHOLE IN THE BILL AROUND HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS THAT WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT -- WE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROHIBITION ON OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN FINALLY WE REALLY DO REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROHIBITION ON THE PARKING RESTRICTIONS THIS IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING IN OUR AREA SAID HELLFIRE ISSUES. WE GET VERY NERVOUS ABOUT -- ROADS THAT WHERE THEY ARE VERY NARROW IN SOME OF OUR MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE IF YOU CANNOT GET A FIRE TRUCK DOWN IF YOU HAVE. A CARS PARKED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD SO THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT SORT THANKFUL FOR THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BUT STILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL. OTHER FOLKS HONOREES CONCERNS. OKAY THE MATTERS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS THOUGHTS. QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR COULD YOU SPEAK TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. YEAH THE END OF THE DAY MY MY STAFF JUST MATCHING THAT WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS WE HAVE [inaudible] ON THE FIRE STORIES HAVE THE ULTIMATE FRIDAY ON WHETHER TO PERMIT NEEDY YOU I'M SO IF -- AND EIGHTY YOU ISN'T BEING TO BE AND STAY FOR ANY REASON THEN ULTIMATELY WILL BE PERMITTED OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY QUESTIONS OF ZERO CASKEY. WITH THE PLOT FOR A FIVE EIGHTY BILLS THAT WE HAVE. AN AGREEMENT WITH AUTHORS BOB-HARMONIZATION WE HAVE FRIENDS SINCE THE EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET VERSUS SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT FIFTY THEY'LL THEY'LL BE SOMETHING THAT THAT -- I WILL NOTE THAT THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT FROM THE NATIONAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL TALKS ABOUT THIS BILL REMOVING THE REMAINING BARRIERS. ROOM SOME OF THE RAINY BARRIERS FOR SOME TO GO OUT BUT EXISTING LAW IS THE STAFF AND THE AUTHOR HAVE. INDICATED THAT DOESN'T ALLOW US THE FIRE DISTRICTS TO MAKE A FINDING THAT IT SAID IT THAT THE AREA IS A FIRE DANGER IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM AN AUTOMATIC YOU. YOU HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON PARKING BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CURRENT STATE LAW ALLOWS NO ADDITIONAL PARKING IF YOU LIVE WITHIN A HALF MILE OF TRANSIT SO THERE'S THERE'S AN OVERLAY THAT GOES IN BUT IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE THAT. THAT AREA THEN THEN YOU'D -- THIS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE A OPPORTUNITY -- TO BLOCK IT SO WITHOUT MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. THE QUESTION I BY SIR YES I JUST LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE ISSUE REGARDING ENOUGH SAFETY PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES. ARE OUT LOT COVERAGE HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE SAFETY OF IT GOING ON ON BOUGHT FOR ACCESS. FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY REASONS FIRST RESPONDERS AND IN PARTICULAR THE PROXIMITY TO THAT -- WELLINGS NEXT DOOR SO I DON'T THINK OF I THINK IT'S AWFULLY SIMPLISTIC TO SAY THAT THE FIRE. FOLKS WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON OUT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY PART OF THE ZONING. SO THAT REALLY NEEDS A DEEPER DIVE A STRONGER LOOK AT WHETHER THAT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT FUNDING MEDICALLY MINISTERIAL LEE -- EXEMPTED BECAUSE THE IT HAS AFFECTED OUR PROPERTIES IN LAGUNA BEACH WITH THE FIRES THERE. MIGHT REMEMBER THE THE DEBATE THAT WENT ON REGARDING GRANNY FLAT SO WHEN THAT WAS BEING INCORPORATED YOU MAY NOT BECAUSE THAT WAS BACK IN. THE LATE EIGHTIES BUT I'M REALLY REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ALSO. WE HAVE MANY -- DWELLINGS AND SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY THAT ARE BUILT ON CALL THE FAX. IN THOSE HAVE VERY FEW -- CURB pREASON SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T PARK ON THE STREET. OUR BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GET OUT OF THOSE TRUCKS DOWN AND OUT THE FIRE THIRTY ACTUALLY DID WEIGH IN ON SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT FROM NOW I'LL EARLY AND MIDDLE NINETIES. NOT APPROVING BECAUSE INDUSTRIES WERE TOO NARROW. THAT THOSE COME AFTER THE FACT IN WHEN YOU'RE JUST DOING AND EIGHTY YOU. KNOW THAT CAN EASILY BE MALE SO THAT SOMETHING I THINK NEEDS A REALLY CLOSER LOOK AT SO WITHOUT I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY BECAUSE I THINK AB USE ARE REALLY. A GOOD PATH TO OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY ISSUE. THAT WE CANNOT I THINK DENY WITH ALWAYS BEEN PART OF GOOD PLANNING AND IT WAS THEIR SPECIFICALLY -- TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD PUBLIC THE SAFETY AND HEALTH ISSUES OF COMMUNITIES ARE ADDRESS THROUGH GOOD URBAN PLANNING. AND I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE POINTERS THAT ARE VERY VERY WELL TAKEN -- I WOULD JUST GIVE ONE EXAMPLE SOME OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGHT AGAINST HIS WE HAVE THE CITY OF PEOPLE ON WHICH IS AND AND YOU KNOW VERY CLOSE TO MY CITY -- THEY HAVE A REQUIREMENT OF A MINIMUM EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT TO BUILD AN EIGHTY YEAR AND THAT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT -- BEYOND TO FIRE SAFETY ISSUES I THINK I THINK YOUR ISSUES AROUND FIRE SAFETY ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT BUT I THINK. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGHT AGAINST. OKAY THIS IS ABOUT QUESTIONS YES SENATE ON THE SCHOOL REAL QUICK SO ON THE EIGHT THOUSAND AS QUITE A FEW IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IS ALREADY THE EXISTING THERE. SO IF YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW THE SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOME YOU'RE IT SO THAT THOSE ARE NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THE I MEAN IT. WAS. THAT CHAT WAS STOP FOR SECOND I MEAN THERE HAS TO BE SOME ABILITIES DO AS WE COMMONSENSE ME HAS TO HAS TO WORK. FOR THE DIVISIONAL SQUARE FOOT EASIER PUTTING IN THERE SO I'M ASSUMING THAT -- THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO SAY HEY FOR THE FIRE IF THERE'S NOT ACCESS EGRESS. THOSE ISSUES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT. WHAT WILL COMPLEMENT A COMMUNITY AND NOT HINDER IT? AND COMING OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNDERSTANDING AND APPROVING MANY DIFFERENT DOES SUBDIVISIONS -- AND WE WE GOT WITH THE THE GRANNY FLATS AS WELL IN THERE GOOD TOOL THEY'RE ACTUALLY HELPFUL FOR THE COMMUNITY -- WHERE THEY MAKE SENSE BUT SOME PLACES THE LOT SIZES DON'T MAKE THAT THEY JUST DON'T MAKE SENSE AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE THE ABILITY? FOR THE LOCALS TO BE ON THE WAY IN. WHERE THEY WERE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND WHERE DOES MAKE SENSE ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE -- TO YOU KNOW IF. PUT IN THOSE SAID ADDITIONAL UNITS. AT LUIS PARTE AYE AYE I JUST ECHO THE THE THE COMMENT THAT WHILE WE TAKE THOSE CONCERNS SERIOUSLY -- THE BILL WOULD NOT AFFECT CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING STANDARDS CODE WHICH CONTAINS THE FIRE CODE WHICH DESCRIBES -- BOTH BUILDING MATERIALS THAT SHOULD BE USED PREVENT FIRE BUT ALSO SET STANDARDS FOR INGRESS AND EGRESS. THOSE ISSUES WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY AB -- SIXTY EIGHT SIMILARLY -- STATE EIGHTY YOU LAW HAS A PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE AS A PART OF THE SAID THAT THE SETBACK THAT THEY WOULD. BE BE ALLOWED TO IMPOSE THEY IT ALLOWS THEM TO CONSIDER FIRE SAFETY AS A PART OF THAT -- SO I WOULD DEFINITELY ECHO THAT WE TAKE THOSE CONCERNS OR SAY OKAY. YEAH I CAN FOR MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE PROBLEMS NOT SO MUCH THAT THE HAVE SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE ON AN EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT EACH OF AN EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT YOU HAVE AN EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOUSE. THAT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN AND THE CITY WANTS TO SAY YOU'RE RESTRICTED 240% OF YOUR EXISTING HOME THAT'S WHAT YOU. GO TO BERKELEY WONDERFUL NANCY CENTER SO I CAN SAY THAT. YOU HAVE THEY HAVE IT'S IT'S THE FLIP FLOP OF WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE A CHALLENGE. BY THE WAY THIS THIS BILL WILL BE GOING TO GOVERN TO FINANCE IT PASSES OUT COMMITTEE TODAY SO THEY'LL BE LOOKING ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. LAKE IT'S EXPECTED SINISTER. SMILE I WILL I WAS SITTING IN MY OFFICE WORKING ON SOMETHING ON RELATED TO THIS BILL IS WATCHING ON TV SO I APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING THE PRESENTATION IS ACTUALLY COMPELLED BY -- WHAT I HEARD FROM SOME MY COLLEAGUES IN SOME OF THE CONCERNS IN THE LEAGUE I JUST? I WASN'T PLANNING TO HOLD OFF ON THE BILL TODAY I I JUST NEED TO DO WAY IN BECAUSE WHAT I HEARD LET'S GET SPECIFIC HERE ON FIRE CODE ISSUE COMING DRILL DOWN ON THAT IT JUST. GETS SO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BUILDING INSPECTION ARE YOU ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE PLANNING [inaudible] THERE IS. THERE'S TWO PIECES AND LUIS FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN BUT I THINK THERE'S THE BUILDING CODES THAT GET INTO HOW YOU BUILD. THE EIGHTY YOU -- TO INSURE THAT IT'S SAFE AND AS YOU KNOW SAFE IN CASE OF FIRE AND THEN THERE'S THE INDIVIDUAL PERMITS WHERE AND THE BUILDING PERMIT. IS DEPENDENT ON IN THIS CASE IF YOU MEET THE REQUIREMENTS BUT THE PENDING THE APPROVAL OF THE FIRE AUTHORITIES. THAT IS KIND OF TO ENSURE THE THE BILL COVERS BOTH. SO THE BILL DOESN'T HATCH EITHER OF THOSE THAT'S JUST EXISTING ON AND SO -- WHOM WHO DECIDES IN THE TRANSPORTATION LAND USE ELEMENT YOU'RE SAYING THIS THAT THAT WOULD BE PREEMPTED LIKE THAT. YOU COULD ORROW EIGHTY USE IN CERTAIN AREAS THROUGH THE THAT THIS SPECIFIC PLAN OR THE GENERAL PLAN IN THE AREA. THAT YOU CONSULT YOU COULD ZONE THAT OR NO GOT TO SELL THE BILL -- REQUIRES THAT WHERE HOUSING RESIDENTIAL ZONING IS REQUIRED THAT YOU CAN'T BAR EIGHTIES FROM BEING BUILT IN THAT SPACE. BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE EIGHTIES BE BUILT IN IS DOWN IN AN AREA THAT'S NOT ON FOR RESIDENTIAL USE. SO IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED THAT THERE'S A HIGH FIRE RISK FOR AN AREA AND SAYS THAT RESIDENTIAL USES ARE NOT PERMITTED IN THAT AREA. AB SIXTY EIGHT WOULD NOT COMPEL THEM TO GO ALLOW THE HOUSING RIGHT PUTTING NEIGHBORHOODS YES YOU YOU IN OTHER WORDS YOU COULD IN AT THE LAND USE LEVEL YOU CAN THAT THE FIRE -- DEPARTMENT -- MARSHALL I GUESS IN THIS CASE MARSHALL COULDN'T COME IN IT'S MORE ABOUT THE LIKE IF THE SPACE ITSELF LIKE DEFENSIBLE SPACE ISSUE SORT OF THAT SET BACK ISSUES MORE ABOUT. THAT THEY LIKE TRAFFIC BOTTLENECK EVACUATION ISSUES THAT ARE TO SAY YES THAT'S TRUE ALTHOUGH WE WOULD ASSUME THAT LOCALS ARE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION HOW DOES OWN. RESIDENTIAL AREAS TO INCORPORATE FIRE SAFETY I GUESS THAT. WE LAID OFF TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION SOME AS WHEN YOU GET BERKELEY AND YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW THESE HILLS AND THEN IT JUST THINGS JUST SORT OF HAPPENED YOU FIND THESE MEANDERING NEIGHBORHOODS THAT JUST SORT OF BECOME. AND IT'S AND IT'S JUST A IT'S A TRICKY NEEDLE THREATEN THOSE. WE DON'T TOUCH EXISTING LAW THIS IS ALL EXISTING LAW. SO OUR BILL DOES NOT. TOUCH ANY OF THAT. IT'S A GOOD THING ON A GO FORWARD BASIS YES. EVEN ON MY PRIOR SAFETY YEAH WE DON'T TOUCH FAR SO YEAH. WE WE UNDERSTAND YOUR ISSUE WITH -- YES IS IT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE ARTICULATING IS JUST WHAT IS EXISTING LAW IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH. OKAY OUR OUR CABLE DOES NOT TOUCH YOU CAN JUDGE I GOT YOU. ALL RIGHT SORRY FOR JUMPING IN I JUST -- YEAH THIS IS A BIG DEAL BACK HOME OF COURSE -- YEAH I'M SENSITIVE ABOUT IT SO I'M I'M GONNA HOLD OFF TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO DRILL DOWN FURTHER AND JUST GET SOME CLARITY AND WALK THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT THE MECHANICS WILL BE BECAUSE I THINK. WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THE INTENT ISN'T TO OVERRIDE FIRE SAFETY? THAT THAT THAT'S NOT IN THAT ONE FACT WE DON'T TOUCH FAR SO YOU DON'T EVEN TOUCH IT SO IT'S ALL RIGHT SO IT'S ALL THE ALL THE CONCERNS YOU ARE. ADDRESSING WE'RE JUST ARTICULATING WHAT CURRENT LAW IS OUR BILL DOES NOT OKAY DO ANYTHING UNDERSTOOD ON THIS ISSUE. IN REGARDS CARP HELPS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. YEAH SENATE OLLIE. SO THIS MAKE SURE MAKE CLEAR SO IT AT EXISTING SET BACKS IN THE SUBDIVISION. HAVE TO BE MET [inaudible] EXISTING. THE FARMERS ARE TO COME OUT AND SAY YES YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE SECOND UNIT IN. BECAUSE IT WILL MEET THE STANDARDS THAT IS STILL SAFE. IF THEY DON'T MEET THOSE STANDARDS THEY CAN'T THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO THEN MOVE FORWARD. AS A REALLY TO FIRE SAFETY AND AND THEN THE SET BACKS FOR LOT SIZES BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA ADD ANOTHER UNIT IN THERE. IF YOU HAVE A SET BACK OF TWENTY FEET FROM THE FROM THE PROPERTY LINE YOU HAVE TO STILL MEET THAT SET BACK CORRECT. THE BILL WOULD CURTAIL -- SOME ABILITY TO IMPOSE OR DO YOU EXISTING LAWS ALREADY HAS -- SOME IMPOSITIONS ON ABILITY TO DETERMINE THINGS LIKE LOTS OF OUR OR SETBACKS -- BUT AS A REALLY TO FIRE SAFETY IF THERE'S A FIRE SAFETY ISSUE IMPOSED BY -- THE THE STEP BACK AND THEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD IMPOSE YES. THEY CAN DâN SO THIS SET BACKS UP TO STAY THE SAME OR NO. AS A REALLY TO FIRE SAFETY THEY WOULD HAVE TO STAY THE SAME BUT OTHER SETBACKS COULD BE WAIVED BY THE MINISTER PROVISIONS OF THE AB [inaudible] SIXTY THE SERVER. I'M JUST READING WHAT THE DIGESTIVE SAYING ABOUT THE THE BILL ITSELF AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY CONFUSING AND OUT PROBABLY IS WHERE YOU NEED. TO KIND OF FOCUS IN GOING FORWARD IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS THIS DIGEST THIS IS ON OUR ITEM NUMBER C. PROVIDES AT A LOCAL EIGHTY YOU OR DANCE CANNOT IMPOSE Là COVERAGE STANDARDS. REQUIRE MINIMUM LOT SIZE OR CERTAIN SET BACKS AND I THINK -- GOES ON ABOUT THE PARKING WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I THINK THE FACT BACK ISSUES IS. SIGNIFICANTLY HUGE IN TERMS OF WHO'S GONNA SAY -- THAT YOU CAN OR CANNOT BUILD THIS PARTICULAR EDIE YOU BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GOING TO BE IN A VERY CONFUSING POSITION SAYING YOU KNOW THIS OF THE LAW SAYS ACT. AND IS NOW WE HAVE TO CALL THE FIRE FOLKS IN. AND THEY MAY HAVE ALREADY APPROVED IT MINISTERIAL COULD ABOUT ALREADY GONE THROUGH SO I THINK THAT JUST NEEDS TO BE. REFINED A LITTLE -- YOU KNOW MORE SPECIFICALLY ARE THAT THAT HAS TO BE SUBJECT TO MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THE LANGUAGE I READ A SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE LOCAL FIRE FORTY YEAR. FIRE SAFETY COUNCIL WHATEVER EXIST IN A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT THE SET BACK THERE'S ALSO NOISE STANDARDS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT IN CERTAIN CITIES WHERE YOU FEEL THE THAT BACK AREA WITH EQUIPMENT. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW AIR CONDITIONERS OR WHATEVER AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE PART OF HEALTH AND SAFETY TO SO. I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A LITTLE MORE. SPECIFICITY ON WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO OVERRIDE THE MINISTERIAL REVIEW IF THERE'S AN ISSUE SOMETHING THAT WOULD. YOU KNOW DEFINE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CONFUSION AND THEN YOU GOT LITIGATION. YEAH I THINK I'M FOR HALF TAKE A LOOK THAT WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. WHY? EIGHT I'M GONNA HAVE OUR STAFF TALK -- TO THE GOVERNMENT FLOATED IF IF THE BILL PASSES OUT TODAY I MEAN DOES. HAVE STAFF GALLAGHER WITH THE GUN FINANCE. COMMITTEE STAFF. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED HERE TODAY ARE -- RELATED TO THAT COMMITTEE. SO THAT THEY CAN KIND OF TAKE A PASS AT A NUMBER OF THESE CONCERNS GLAM AFFECT. NUMBER ISSUES OF AN RAISE THAT I THINK OF MERIT A LITTLE MORE DEEP DIVE. SO I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY -- TO YOU CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THIS BILL TODAY BUT I DO THINK TO SOME MORE WORK TO BE DONE THE NEXT COMMITTEE. FOR OKAY HARM TO ANY FOR THE QUESTION SAID CENTER.

METHANE IS A CLIMATE CHANGING GAS MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN CARBON DIOXIDE WHILE OTHER CO ADMITTED HERE POLLUTANTS LIKE BENZENE CAN CAUSE CANCER.

TO REMOVE THE DIGITAL RECEIPT MANDATE. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS STARTING ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO WOULD REQUIRE RECEIPTS BE AVAILABLE ONLY UPON REQUEST IN FOR THOSE RECEIPTS TO BE BPA PPS FREE AND NO LONGER? THAN NECESSARY -- WE'VE SEEN A DOCUMENT REPORTS ABOUT HOW MUCH RENEWABLE RESOURCES ARE USED FOR PAPER RECEIPTS. BUT THERE'S THE THREE MILLION TREES WITH THE NINE BILLION GALLONS OF WATER NATION WIDE IN THE THREE HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION POUNDS OF WASTE -- AS YOU KNOW PROCEEDS ARE NOT COMPOSTABLE AND THEY'RE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO RESPOND CALL ESPECIALLY WITH THE TOXIC PAPER. OUT WITHOUT RESPECT YOURS FOR AYE VOTE AB ONE SIXTY ONE WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING OFFICE OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THIS BILL REALLY TACKLES ONE OF THE LOW HANGING FRUITS IN TERMS OF WASTE REDUCTION. AND THAT'S THE CATEGORY OF PRODUCTS THAT WE GET HANDED THAT WE DON'T WANT -- WHEN WE BUY A MORNING CUP OF COFFEE OR DOWN AT WE DON'T NEED A RECEIPT FOR THAT? WHEN WE GO TO CVS AND END UP WITH A FOUR FOOT LONG WORSE THE? AGAIN I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT A FOUR FOOT LONGER SEE THE ALL THE BILL SAYS IS THAT IF YOU DON'T WANT A RECEIPT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET -- ONE SAID IT'S IT'S A SOURCE REDUCTION STRATEGY BUT ALSO MAKES FOLKS AWARE OF THE WAYS THAT THEY CONSUME ON DAILY BASIS. THEY MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF AND THEN SECONDLY IT ELIMINATES A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION AND COMPOSTING AND RECYCLING. THAT BPA AND BE PS -- END UP AND COMPOST AND IN THE RECYCLING STREAM THE THERMAL COATINGS MAKE THE PAPER HARD TO RECYCLE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS THIS IS A REALLY COMMONSENSE BILL THANK YOU. NO ALLEY -- FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP -- ALL FOCUS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AFFECTS OF THIS IS BILLS WITH TOXICS AND THIS. BILL AB ONE SIXTY ONE DEALS WITH A TOXIC MATTER AND THAT IS THE BEST BEING ALTERED BPA BE PS AND THE RECEIPTS -- IN TWENTY ELEVEN THIS LEGISLATURE AND WAS CHAIRED BY SENATOR WITH HOUSEKEEPING AND CHAIR OF THE S. AND COMMITTEE PASSED. A BILL BANNING BISPING ALL A AND BABY BALLS AND SIPPY CUPS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND IS NOW LAW AND WHAT THAT DID WAS LEAD THE WAY LEADING TO THE INDUSTRY SITTING DOWN WITH THE U. S. FDA SAYING WE'LL JUST TAKE IT OUT OF THESE THINGS SO CALIFORNIA WAS A LEADER. AND THAT ENDED UP IN A CASCADING OF OF MARKET CHANGES THAT GOT THIS TOXIC CHEMICAL OUT OF CONSUMERS PRODUCTS WE THINK THE SAME SHOULD BE DONE FOR PAPER RECEIPTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY AFFECTS ONE OUT ON A SUPPORT. TEN OF ELEVEN ON ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION AND SUPPORT HIM [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] EITHER. CATHERINE GARCIA ON BEHALF OF YOUR CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. OKAY OUR OPPOSITION TRUCKS HONOREES CONCERNS BUT THE BILL GO. FOR I'M IN BETWEEN -- SIGNED NOT OPPOSE A SIMILAR POSITION IS A PUZZLE CEMENT ON AIR RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ATION -- WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO MR TING IN IS -- STAFF BOB GREAT TO WORK WITH OUR CONCERN IS THAT -- AS YOU ALL KNOW GROWS JUST HAVE TO CAST BE TWO SEVENTY WHICH MEANS WE DON'T HAVE THE SINGLE USE PLASTIC BAGS. AS A RESULT A LOT OF CUSTOMERS NOW AND YOU'LL GO TO THE STORE AND SEE YOURSELF SURGERY THE WALK OUT THE STORE WITH THEIR FOR THE PRODUCTS IN THE CART. IN THEIR HAND IN THEIR OWN BAG -- BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE ASKED OR WE WOULD. ASK THAT THE CHAIRED OR MISTER TING TO ACCOMMODATE US THE BILL CAME OUT OF ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS WITH. A SORT OF OFFRAMP FOR PEOPLE LIKE US WHERE -- WE CAN PROVIDE THE BBB PSP RECEIPTS WE JUST NEED TO GIVE THE RECEIPT TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S BOTCHED UP WHEN THE STORE -- WE WOULD ASK THE SAME THING HERE BECAUSE THE FAULT IS STILL NO RECEIPT AND WE NEED TO GET THE RECEIPT TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S BOUGHT STUFF TO DO AS MUCH STUFF SO. OUR REQUEST ASSEMBLY THAT -- FOR FOLKS WHO ARE SUBJECT SB TWO SEVENTY AS GROCERS ARE AND AND SPEAKING TO WASTE REDUCTION WE'VE GIVEN AT THE OFFICE TO TO USE THAT TERM -- WE'RE OKAY WITH GONE BPA PPS FREE ADDRESSING THE TOXICS ISSUE AND WE'VE LET -- MISTER TING STAFF KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT THERE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO ELIMINATE. AB PSP RECEIPTS WE JUST AS A WE CAN STILL GET THE RECEIPT BECAUSE SHOPLIFTING IS A BIG PROBLEM RECEIPTS ARE WAY TO FIGURE OUT WHO HAS AND HAS ABOUT STUFF AND AND THAT'S OUR POSITION TO SUPPOSE WAS AMENDED WE ASK FOR THAT. AMENDMENT -- TO BE TAKEN AT SOME POINT. BEFORE YOU GO LET'S WHAT DISTURBS ME PEOPLE HERE WHEN WE ASK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I I HEARD RAISED EARLIER -- WE'LL TRY AND COURAGE PEOPLE YOU KNOW -- TO TO NOT USE THE BAGS -- THAT'S A WASTE REDUCTION ISSUES BECAUSE WELL SO PEOPLE ARE COMING WITH THEIR OWN BAG THEIR OWN SHOPPING CARDS. ARE THAT'S ALL GOOD BUT IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT I WOULD THINK TO VERIFY THAT SOMEONE ACTUALLY PURCHASED THE ITEMS THAT THEY'RE WALKING OUT OF THE STORE WITH -- OBVIOUSLY THIRD THERE WITH THAT STORE PROVIDING BAGS IT PROVIDES A LITTLE MORE OF AN INDICATION SO. HOW DOES HOW DOES A STORE -- DEAL WITH THIS QUESTION -- IF THEY'RE USING THEIR OWN BAGS AND AND THERE'S NO RECIBE PROVIDED I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION MISS MARINO HAS ASSOCIATIONS BEEN BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH WE HAVE A DIALOGUE -- IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT -- IT'S GREAT ARGUMENT HOWEVER MOST STORES DON'T CHECK RECEIPTS UPON LEAVING THE STORE. SO FROM MOSCOW DEFINITELY DOES COSCO DOES BUT MOST GROCERS DON'T IF YOU'RE IN A SAFE WAY YOUR LUCKY. YOUR IN A ALBERTSON'S -- SAVE MART I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME THEY CHECKED OR THERE ARE CERTAIN RETAILERS COSCO BEST BUY. I BELIEVE SAM'S CLUB WALMART THEY THEY DEFINITELY DO THAT. MOST RETAILERS DO NOT RITE AID WALGREENS WE CAN GO DOWN THE LIST TO ME WHEN YOU GET A RECEIPT. YOU WALK OUT HI I'M NOW I DON'T EVEN TAKE BACK ALL ALL WALK OUT WITH THE STUFF IN MY ARMS -- HOW TO REMEMBER THE LAST TIME OUTSIDE OF THOSE THOSE FEW INSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE CHECKED AGAIN? I THINK WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE A DIALOGUE TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND A SWEET SPOT AND WE HOPE WE CAN -- I THINK IN 80% OF THE SITUATIONS YOU ARE NOT EVER ASK FOR A RECEIPT UPON EXITING THAT STORE RIGHT TO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WELL THE POINT IS I THINK WORK WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE THE DIALOGUE TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT [inaudible] HELLO. TO UP WITH PERSON OBVIOUSLY -- TO AS A MEMBER KINGS POINT -- YET OBVIOUSLY SAFE WITH THERE'S NO PEOPLE CHECKING RECEIPTS ON THE WAY OUT BUT THERE IS SECURITY EITHER -- HIGHER SECURITY OR UNDER HAVE SECURITY THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT THE DOOR SOMETIMES SOMETIMES I DO CHECK IT'S NOT AS COSTS GO WITH A FORMALLY DO IT AS AN OPERATIONAL -- THING THAT THEY DO BUT FOR A LOT OF STORES WHERE PARTICULAR THERE'S HIGHER INSTEAD OF SHOPLIFTING AFTER THING THEIR SECURITY WHO WILL WHO WILL ASK TO SEE RECEIVE IT'S NOT A FORMAL PROCEDURE BUT CERTAIN TIMES A DAY OR OR CERTAIN PLACES. AGAIN WHEN PEOPLE LEAVING THE STORE THOUGH SOMETIMES HAS TAKEN AS THE RECEIPT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETIMES WILL DISMISS WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY LEAVING THE STORE THE CART FULL OF YOU KNOW CASE OF BEER AND DID YOU BUY IT OR NOT. YEAH I MEAN ALMOST IT'S USUALLY A MAKES YOU WONDER ONE OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY A ONE OF THE PROPONENTS WAS THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T. ASK FOR FOUR FOOT -- RECEIPT AND THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S HELLO MY AGE BUT MAYBE THERE'S A WAY. TO ALLOW STORES TO PROVIDE SOMETHING MUCH MORE -- DISTINCTION SMALL. THAT WOULD HAVE THE KIND OF WASTE -- ISSUES ASSOCIATE WITH A FOUR FOOT RECEIPT WHILE ALSO AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING FOR SOME FORM OF VERIFICATION IN THOSE STORES WHAT WHERE THERE IS A HIGH SHOPLIFTING RIGHT. I THINK ALSO IF YOU -- THAT THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS -- IF YOU'RE OUT LIKE THE TARGET THE TRACK IT BASED ON YOUR CREDIT CARD -- YOU KNOW APPLE HAS BEEN HIGHLY PUBLICIZED IN TERMS OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY GOING IN THERE AND AND SHOPLIFTING. THEY'RE ONE OF THE STORES WERE YOU CAN'T GET A PAPER SEE AND AND AGAIN. THE BILL APSLEY ALLOWS OUT FOR PAPER RECEIPTS UPON REQUEST SO IF YOU WANT A PAPER RECEIPT YOU CAN ALWAYS REQUEST. FOR THEM TO JUST ON THIS ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE OUT ON THE GROCERY YEAH. YES CENTER -- BECAUSE WHERE I LIVE THERE'S BEEN A EITHER LIMITS ON BAGS OR JUST A KIND OF PUBLIC. NOT WANTING TO USE BAGS AND SINCE MOST OF US. FORGET. THE BAGS YEAH YEAH YEAH SO BASICALLY MOST PEOPLE ARE CARRYING AROUND RIGHT THE THINGS THEY PURCHASED. AND SO OF COURSE VERY MANY STORES ARE THAN NERVOUS WILL THAT MIGHT MEAN -- YOU STONE OR WHATEVER BUT WHAT THE WHAT'S COMMON IN MY AREA AROUND SOURCES THE PORTAL STICKER. THEY'LL EITHER STAMP LIKE YOU DO WHEN YOU GO TO A CONCERT AND THAT MEANS YOU BOUGHT IT. FOR A LITTLE STICKER IN THAT WAY THERE OR THEIR OR SECURITY OR EVER DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WALKING AROUND WITH A BUNCH OF GOODS IN YOUR ARMS THAT YOU BOUGHT. SO THEY DON'T YOU DON'T NEED THE RECEIPT TO SHOW THAT YOU BY. YEAH I LOOK I GUESS MY POINT IS IF WE'RE IF WE'RE JUST. YOU KNOW AT WHAT AT WHAT POINT DOES THE HERE WE ARE. STEPPING IN AND TELLING STORIES WHAT TO DO AND WHAT POINT IS THE WASTE REDUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. I OUTWEIGH THE WASTE YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S ME NEW WASTE PRODUCED BY THE STICKERS PERHAPS AND MAYBE THERE CAN BE LESS RECYCLABLE THAN THAT RECEIPTS. YOU KNOW WHAT RIGHT AND UP ON THE FLOOR YOUR RAISE ONE OTHER POINT THAT AS MY UNDERSTAND HAS MEMORIES SO WE ARE. THE DOMAIN WE HAVE IN THIS COMMITTEE IS THE ISSUE OF WASTE BUT MOST RECEIPTS. ESPECIALLY AFTER CREDIT CARD. ARE THE HEAT SENSITIVE. THE HEAT SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES EPA THIS FINALE. THERE IS RECENT DATA THAT SHOWS IF YOU USE HAND SANITIZER. YOU CONCENTRATE THE BPA. ON YOUR HANDS AND DUST YOU YOU HAVE A HIGHER YOU ABSORB MORE AND SO. IN LOOKING AT PEOPLE WHO WORK AT STORES AND HANDLE RECEIPTS. ALREADY AMERICANS HAVE THE HIGHER LEVEL OF BPA. IN THEIR BLOOD IN THEIR BODY BODY COUNT OF AND STORE CLERKS. HAVE THE HIGHEST. OF AMERICANS BECAUSE OF THAT SO WHILE THAT'S NOT THE DOMAIN OF OUR I COMMITTEE. IS A FACTOR THAT SHOULD END THERE. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU -- OTHER FOLKS TO ONE OF HIS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. HELLO MY NAME IS STUART HOMAN CHIEF SCIENTIST AMERICAN FORCING PAPER ASSOCIATION. I'M SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION AB. ONE SIXTY ONE I'M HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT PAPER RECEIPTS THAT ARE BEING USED TO SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ON APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER SOME FACTS ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS. PLEASE LET ME START WITH INFORMATION ON BISCAYNE ALL A IS A DATE ARE REAL FAST. AND THEN COMPARE BY ANALOGY TO BISPING ALL S.. THAT IS ACTUALLY USED IN RECEIPTS. NUMBER ONE PAPER RECEIPTS OR SAFE FOR CONSUMERS AND POINT OF SAFE SALE PERSONNEL TO HANDLE. MAJORITY BPA EXPOSURES FROM FOOD FDA'S CURRENT PERSPECTIVE BASED ON ITS MOST RECENT SAFETY ASSESSMENT. IS THE BPA IS SAFE AT THE CURRENT LEVELS OF CURRENT FOODS. TO DATE NO STUDIES HAVE BEEN LINKED VOTER TO BE PA WITH CANCER IN HUMANS. AND ANIMAL STUDIES SUPPORT THIS VERY SCIENTIFIC GROUPS INCLUDING THE US TOXICOLOGY PROGRAM. AND THE E. U. THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT BP IS BPA IS NOT A CARCINOGEN. THE NDP ALSO CONDUCTED THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO LINK CONSUMER OR COCKING BIGGEST OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES TO BPA. WITH REPRODUCTIVE AFFECTS OUR DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS IN HUMANS. ALTHOUGH BPA HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POSSIBLE AND THE PRINTER DISRUPTOR SUBSEQUENT STUDIES EXAMINING DEVELOPMENTAL REPRODUCTIVE ARM UNIFICATION ANIMALS AND HUMANS. DO NOT SUPPORT THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH ADVERSE EFFECTS. BOTH THE FDA AND AFTER CONCLUDE THAT ANTICIPATED CONSUMER EXPOSURES TO BPA POSES NO HEALTH RISK. ANTICIPATED OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO BE P. A. SUCH AS BY CASHIERS ARE ALSO JUDGED TO BE SAFE. WE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH CITATIONS IN THE LITERATURE SHOWING THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE AND LET SUPPORTS THAT OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE IS SAFE. SIMILAR OR EVEN LESS B. P. S. GETS INTO THE BODY FROM THERMAL RECEIPTS THE BPA. BASED ON STUDIES IN CELLS IN SIMPLE ORGANISMS PPS HAS SIMILAR OR LOWER RESPONSE AND BPA. THIS IMPLIES THAT BE PS CONCENTRATIONS CONSUMERS IN CASH YEARS MIGHT BE EXPOSED WILL BE SAFE. CONTRARY TO CLAIMS BY BILL SUPPORTERS THE E. U. IS NOT BANNED BE PS AND THERMAL RECEIPT PAPERS. THAT YOU BàN APPLIES TO BE PA ONLY ALSO THAT NO MAN US MANUFACTURERS AND NONE OF THE MAJOR IMPORTERS. WHO WE REPRESENT USE PAPERS WITH BPA COATINGS? THIS LEGISLATION SHOULD NOT BE A VEHICLE THE MAN BE PS AND RECEIVE PAPERS. PROP SIXTY FIVE REQUIRES BUSINESSES PROVIDE WARNINGS ABOUT SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS. THE LIST INCLUDES OVER NINE HUNDRED CHEMICALS AND ALSO INCLUDES THE SAFE HARBOR LEVEL FOR EACH CHEMICAL IF ONE HAS BEEN ADOPTED. IT ALSO IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE PROP SIXTY FIVE LIST DOES NOT INCLUDE THE P. S.. IF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO APPROPRIATELY REGULATE BE PS IN RECEIPT PAPER IT SHOULD DO SO BY THE VEHICLE. BUY THIS VEHICLE OR THROUGH THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCT PROGRAM TO AVOID CHEMICAL USE BANDS THAT LACKS SIGN TO SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION. FURTHERMORE SOME THERMAL RECEIPT PAPER INCLUDING CALIFORNIA STATE LOTTERY TICKETS PARKING TICKETS BOARDING PASSES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS USE BE PS. IF THESE PRODUCTS POSE A HAZARD AS AB ONE FOR SIXTY ONE CLAIMS THE STATE SHOULDN'T NOT EXEMPT ITSELF WHAT PENALIZING CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. SO IN SUMMARY -- I. R. G. OPPOSE AB ONE SIXTY ONE WHICH IS AND AND RUN AROUND CALIFORNIA'S RIGOROUS AND PROTECTIVE PROCESS. FOR REGULATION OF CHEMICALS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS THANK YOU. WHAT CHAIR MEMBERS ADAMANTLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE? I'LL KEEP MY A OPPOSITION RELATIVELY BRIEF -- FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED THE BILL SPECIFICALLY. THE SKIP THE SLIP CONCEPT WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE FOR ALL RETAILERS. SPECIFICALLY ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO RECEIVE A RECEIPT. MAY MAKE SENSE IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS SUCH AS COFFEE OR OTHER PERISHABLE GOODS WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO RETURN IT. BUT FOR MANY RETAILERS IT'S NOT -- PRACTICAL -- TO HANDLE RETURNS OR LOSS PREVENTION OR CHECKING RECEIPTS AT DOORS WHEN THE CUSTOMER IS THE ONE WITH THE OPTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO RECEIVE THE RECEIPT -- THIS BILL DOES NOT ALLOW -- FOR THE RETAILERS WHICH IN MANY INSTANCES ALREADY OFFER. THE NO RECEIPT BUT THEY DON'T DO SO FOR EVERY PRODUCT WHEN YOU GO BY YOUR TELEVISION OR MAJOR ELECTRONIC GOODS. IT MAKES NO SENSE THAT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE CONSUMER TO SAY I'M NOT TAKING A RECEIPT. AND THEN PUT THE BURDEN ON THE RETAILER TO HAVE TO DECIDE LATER WHETHER TO TAKE THAT -- PRODUCT BACK THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR MANY BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING IN AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE. THAT'S ONE MAJOR ISSUE FUNDAMENTALLY WITH THE BILL AS THE SIP THE SLIP IS THE CONSUMER DRIVEN OPTION THAT THEY CAN DECIDE WHETHER TO ON ANY PRODUCT WHETHER TO TAKE THE RECEIPT THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR MANY RETAILERS -- WITH REGARD TO THE BBS BPA. MOST RETAILERS MOST BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY DO NOT USE BPA IN THE RECEIPT PAPER -- THE ISSUE REALLY IS B. PS PAPER IN THE PRESIDENT. BàN HERE IN CALIFORNIA ON THE PS RECEIPT PAPER WHEN WE HAVE A SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WERE MOVING WITH -- SB THREE NINE TWO WITH NO INDUSTRY OPPOSITION WHICH IS TO EXPEDITE THIS EVER CONSUMER PRODUCT PROGRAM THIS BILL CIRCUMVENTS THAT PROGRAM AND BASICALLY PUT THE BE PS BàN WE WE KNOW THAT IT'S A CANDIDATE CHEMICAL THAT. PTSD IS STUDYING SO WHY ARE WE CIRCUMVENTING THE PROGRAM THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS TRYING -- TO SUPPORT WITH SB THREE NINETY WHICH WHICH IS YOUR BILL MISTER CHAIR AND LASTLY -- IF. IF BIBI A AND B. PS PAPER IS REALLY A HEALTH CONCERN FOR RETAILERS -- FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS -- FOR THE CASHIERS WIRE WEEKS AND IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL AGENCIES IF THERE'S A HUGE ISSUE WE ARE PUTTING THE ENTIRE BURDEN ON PRIVATE BUSINESSES AND THAT FUNDAMENTALLY. WE FEAR FEEL IS ON JUSTIN ON WARRANTED AND IF IT REALLY IS CONCERNED IT SHOULD BE PLACED O ALL. BASICALLY STATE AGENCIES LOCAL AGENCIES AND BUSINESSES OF REALLY THAT BIG OF A CONCERN AND THEY'RE ALL EXEMPTED FROM THE BILL. THANK YOU YEAH LET ME JUST WHILE YOU'RE HERE WE FOLLOW UP ON THIS ONE QUESTION OF OF EXPENSIVE APPLIANCES ALIKE. I WHAT WHAT. WITH THE BILL ALLOW. A COMPANY TO REQUIRE A RECEIPT FOR RETURN TO THAT IF THE YOU HAVE A CONSUMER KNOWS LIKE THERE'S BUYING SOME SUNDRIES AND THERE'S JUST NO WAY THEY'RE GOING TO RETURN AND THEY CAN -- THEY YOU KNOW THEY THEY COULD FEEL REAL COMFORTABLE OPTING OUT OF GETTING A RECEIPT BUT IT BUT FOR SOMETHING SUBSTANTIVE THAT MAY INVOLVE A WARRANTY -- WHAT WE'RE THAT WHAT WERE THE RULES FOR THAT AND I GUESS THERE WILL STILL BE WARRANTY TYPE MATERIALS FOR TELEVISION YOU? YOU KNOW THE SERIAL NUMBER IT'S AGAIN YOU LOOK AT APPLE APPLE ACTUALLY HAS NO PAPER RECEIPTS EVERY RECEIPT IS -- PAPERLESS. IF YOU LOOK AT TARGET WHAT EGGMAN DOESN'T HAVE FEMALE. DID YOU HAVE TO TALK TO A COUPLE I DON'T KNOW. HOW I UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WORKS NO? BUYING EMAILS TO BANG BANG APPLE SO BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PLANS THAT -- OF REFRIGERATOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHAT THE FRIDGE RIGHT AGAIN YOU COULDN'T. WE WE DON'T BAND PAPER SEATS YOU CAN GET A PAPER RECEIPT UPON REQUEST OF YOU BY REFRIGERATOR YOU WOULD LIKE A PAPER RECEIPT -- YOU CAN OPT OUT FOR NOW WITH THE CUSTOMER DOESN'T ASK. FOR ONE AND THEN ONCE A RETURN IT WELL THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PROOF OF PURCHASE. RIGHT YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT THAT'S UP TO THE RETAILER HOW THEY WANNA. HOW WITH A DEMONSTRATED THEY DON'T THEY THEY COULD DO THAT THROUGH A CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION? GEN GENERALLY SPEAKING. WHAT WAS DIFFERENT I CASH? WELL THEN USUALLY YOU WOULD ASK FOR A RECEIPT. OKAY AGAIN WHICH WHICH AGAIN YOU CAN ASK. FOR SO -- YEAH AGAIN THIS THIS IS VERY LOW HANGING FRUIT IN TERMS OF A WASTEFUL PRODUCT THAT MOST PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY THROW THE TRASH EVERY TIME I NEED TO RETURN SOMETHING IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO FIND A PAPER SEAT ACTUALLY. MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO FIND IN THE MAIL I GOT A STACK OF PAPER RECEIPTS AT HOME IN INVARIABLY WHEN I NEED TO RETURN THE PRODUCT THAT I PURCHASED I CAN'T FIND. HELLO SO FADED IT IS RIGHT AND YOU KNOW SO THE OTHER THING IS IN TERMS OF THE CAL CHAMBER IF THE IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN REMOVING OPPOSITION IF WE ALSO INCLUDE STATE A CALIFORNIA WE'RE HAPPY TO CONSIDER THAT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY SENT. AGAIN THE THIS THIS PAPER THESE RECEIPTS ARE NECESSARY THE CONSUMER MAKE THE MAKE THE DECISION WHEN IT IS NECESSARY SO AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A PRODUCT YOU MIGHT WANNA RETURN. ABSOLUTELY I WOULD I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK FOR PAPER RECEIPT MAKE SURE YOU IT'S ON YOUR CREDIT CARD. EXCEPT I THINK ALL OF THOSE -- ARE ARE CAN BE TAKEN TO ACCOUNT TERMS OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY AND DTS SEE -- WE'VE HAD CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY EVALUATING MUCH OF THESE TOXICS I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A CIRCUMVENTION OF THAT PROCESS. BUT AGAIN THIS IS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT MOST PEOPLE PUT IN THE TRASH AND REALLY ASKING PEOPLE BEFORE YOU ASK FOR THAT PRODUCT. DO YOU REALLY NEED IT IF YOU DON'T NEED IT FOR US. FOR IF YOU WANNA MAKE ONE FATHER WILL GADD LIKE TO RESPOND. THE THE ISSUE IS REALLY THAT THIS BILL. ALLOWS THE CONSUMER WITH THE ENTIRE CONTROL OVER WHETHER TO RECEIVE A RECEIPT OR NOT AND FOR FRAUD PREVENTION THE RETAILER THEIR AT THEIR BY HAS NO ABILITY TO REQUIRE THAT FOR LARGE PURCHASES. PURCHASES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE RETURNED THE CONSUMER CAN OPT TO NOT TAKE A RECEIPT AND THEN COME BACK AND DEMAND BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS PRODUCT THE THE THE THE THE THE STORE COULD SAY -- YOU KNOW. RICK RETURNS WILL ONLY BE GRANTED IF YOU HAVE WHETHER IT WITH ABOUT OR SEE. WE CAN CHANGE IT WILL GET AB ALL RETAILERS CHANGE THEIR RETURN POLICY IS TO BASICALLY MAKE IT OVER SEAT ONLY AND THEN PUT THE BURDEN ON RETAILERS TO DO THAT ---WE THINK WE CAN THAT WE THINK OF THIS BILL PASSES THAT WOULD BE A WISE THING BUT WOULD MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE ALLOW RETAILERS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT CATEGORIES TO ALLOW THE CONSIDER RETAILER TO BE THE ONE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO OFFER RECEIPT OR NOT AS OPPOSED TO LINE. CONSUMERS DICTATE THAT AND THAT MEANS OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE ACROSS THE ENTIRE RETAIL CHAIN YEAH I MEAN IT'S THE LEAST OF OUR WORRIES HERE OKAY BUT I I HEAR YOU LET'S HEAR FROM -- FROM OTHER OPPOSITION. MARGARET PLEDGING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION UP MY POSITIVE JUST LIKE TO ADD ONE SENTENCE THERE US CURRENT STATUTORY. AT LIMITATION FOR RETAILERS TO OFFER THE RECEIPTS IN A CLEAN AND TREAT FOR FASHION OBVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO DO IT IT'S A SONG BEVERLY CREDIT CARD ACT. I'M NOT REALLY THE SUBJECT OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT RETAILERS HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN THE WAY THEY OFFER YOU WERE SIEGE WHICH IS WHY SOME RETAILERS HAVE CHOSEN TO DO IT AND OTHERS ARE VERY CAUTIOUS IN IMPLEMENTING THAT POLICY. SO -- THAT'S OBVIOUSLY FOR ANOTHER COMPUTER CYBERSECURITY REASONS WHAT WE KNOW AT THAT. THIS SONG WE'RE REALLY CREDIT CARD ACT AS A STORK ACTED VERY BUT PROHIBITS THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION -- ALONG WITH. A CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION AND THERE'S A CLASS ACTION PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THAT -- AND SO THERE AND WE TOWARDS VERY CAUTIOUS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRANSACTION IS FINISHED AND THEN THEY ASK IF YOU WANTED THE RECEIPT -- WE'D LOVE TO TALK TO THE FOLKS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR ABOUT FIXING ON BEVERLY PARTICULARLY BY THE PASSIONS OF CCPA THE MAN. OKAY BILLS NEXT. GOOD MORNING DANIEL KESSLER KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION WE WE REMAIN OPPOSED AND IT'S IMPORTANT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE COMMENT ABOUT THE APPLE STORE -- AS WE ALL KNOW THEY OFTEN JUST GIVE US THE RECEIPTS BUT JUST LAST WEEK I PURCHASED A PHONE FROM MY DAUGHTER. AT THE APPLE STORE AND THEY GAVE US A PAPER RECEIPT. FOR MY DAUGHTER'S PHONE SHE HAD TO RETURN THE OLD PHONE FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR CREDIT. WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS HER MOTHER I WANTED THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS BACK -- SO I HAD TO HAVE A PAPER RECEIPT. TO GET THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU DON CAP KEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. CARE MEMBER SUGGESTED WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL -- FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK THE HERE. STRUCTURE MEMBERS MET CERTAIN THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED. AND FOR THE ADDITIONAL REASON OF THE LIMITATIONS ON COMMUNICATION ON RECEIPTS WITH REGARDS TO OUR COMMUNICATION WITH GAS. THERE'S SOME LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF THE SPEECH AND IT CAN ONLY BE LIMITED TO ITEMS ESSENTIAL TO THE TRANSACTION SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A LOT OF THE CHARITYPROGRAMS. AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO AND RECEIPTS THAT AREN'T BIG LONG ADVERTISEMENTS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE MULLIGAN O BEHALF OF THE FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY NATIONAL LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MR TERRA CAPULETS REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN FOREST AND PAPER ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. AND I THINK AND SALAS ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN CAR WASH ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA PUBLICIS YUSHIN THE FAMILY WHEN MAKERS. OF CALIFORNIA AND BE P. IN OPPOSITION. JOHN LINGER ON THE OTHER CALIFORNIA FEELS A CONVENE ITS ALLIES WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ON THE COST IMPACT ON BANNING PPS READ POST. CRAP THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO AND IN. ALRIGHT. SIR CASKEY. ON PAGE FOUR OF OUR GUESTS START TO THE END OF THREE AND FOUR LET'S JUST ZERO IN ON WASTE REDUCTION BECAUSE THE AMERICAN. FOREST AND PAPER ASSOCIATION ESTIMATES THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND TONS OF PAPER RECEIPTS. IN IN GRAND VIEW RESEARCH ESTIMATES HERE'S AN ADDITIONAL RECEIPTS EACH YEAR. PUTTING ASIDE BPA AND WHETHER CHOICES THE RETAILER SAID THAT THE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE POTENTIAL REDUCTION OF WASTE IS INCREDIBLE GIVEN THE TONNAGE THAT YOU HAVE. ON CURRENTLY BEING CAUGHT. INTENT. DO YOU HAVE ANY MODELING OR ANY ESTIMATES FROM YOUR A SPONSORS ABOUT WHAT. IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE REDUCTION OF OF THIS THIS WASTE. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING INITIALLY POSSIBLE WILL BE SEEN AS AGAIN WHEN WE MOVED AWAY FROM FROM PLASTIC BAGS WHEN WE MOVED AWAY FROM STRAWS JUST BY TAKING THAT INITIAL ACTION. IN ASKING CONSUMERS TO REALLY THINK TWICE BEFORE THEY ASK FOR IT I THINK COULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. SO WE WE THINK THAT BY CALIFORNIA AGAIN TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS ISSUE WE COULD. GUYS TAKE A SIGNIFICANT CUT OUT OF THAT -- WASTE [inaudible] THEM. AT THE PROPER TIME OPERATING MOVED TO SPELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THIS IS A FORMALLY MAKE A STATEMENT START WITH FIRST OFF. I LOVE THIS COMMITTEE I ASKED FOR TOXIC TWENTY FIRST CAME TO THIS EMILY AND FOR LOTS F REASONS THERE ARE OF THEM I BELIEVE A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOOD WORK WE CAN DO AND I THINK THERE'S ALSO. AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT HOLISTICALLY HERE SO I WANT TO SAY. THIS IS NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS YOUR BILL IS DIRECTED TOWARDS WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT TALKS ABOUT PROP SIXTY FIVE WE HAVE A LOT OF REASONS THAT WE DON'T. GO INTO LONG DELIBERATE -- DEBATES AND BRING SCIENTISTS AND TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE AND AND ALL OF US ARE EXPERTS IN SOME FIELD BUT NOT EXPERTS IN ALL FIELDS? SO I THINK THAT WE AND WE SEEN ONE OFFS AND AND THIS IS TO ME MORE OF ANOTHER ONE OFF AND WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE GOOD DATA -- BACKED UP BY DTS OR PROP SIXTY FIVE OF WHAT I JUST LEARNED FROM MY COLLEAGUE HERE ABOUT. HAND SANITIZER WHAT IT DOES TO THIS PRODUCT ACT -- I DO I DON'T THAT'S FACTUAL OR NOT. I BELIEVE HER BUT I DON'T KNOW IT SHE SHE'S A SCIENTIST THAT REALLY. HASN'T STUDY THAT. SO WE HEAR LOTS OF INFORMATION THAT'S BROUGHT TO OUR COMMITTEES ABOUT YOU KNOW IT'S TIME IS DRIVEN BY MOTION. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. I'M SOMEBODY WHO'S IN BUSINESS AND THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET AND IT'S MAKING US NOT COMPETITIVE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME ALSO WILL DO THE RIGHT THING. TO CONSUMERS AND CLARKSON PEOPLE ARE HANDING HAILING THIS PRODUCT BUT I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT. I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING DRIVEN BY MOTION AND AND I'M BACK FACTS THAT ARE STATED IT DIDN'T DURING THESE COMMITTEE SO. I THINK WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND AND AS A COMMITTEE AND AS YOU KNOW POLICYMAKERS AND SAY. WE NEED EXPERTS TO TELL US WHAT'S THIS IS REALLY DOES OR DOES NOT DO NOT JUST LEGISLATORS OR OR SOME. YOU KNOW WHATEVER LOBBY GROUP FOR THE DATE IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING SO I IT'S NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS THE THE MEMBER THAT'S BRINGING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION FOR A WE'VE SEEN THIS. OVER AND OVER AGAIN OVER THE LAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE [inaudible] SO. FOR THAT REASON AND MANY OTHER REASONS THAT THIS IS GOING TO DRIVE UP THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND I ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WALKING OUT THE DOOR WITH LESS THAN NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE. TO A BUSINESS THERE'S A WE HAVE LAWS THAT ALLOW YOU JUST. BASICALLY STEAL UP TO NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A MISDEMEANOR -- THAT IMPACTS BUSINESS AS WELL SO I THINK WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN. MAYBE GET SOME MORE. SCIENTIFIC DATA ON A LOT OF ISSUES THAT COME TO THESE COMMITTEES AND AND GIVE IT BACK THAT'S WHY WE TO BE. PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF DTS C. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. NOT HAVE TO SIT THROUGH FOUR HOURS OF COMMITTEE HEARINGS WHERE WE HAVE SCIENTISTS DEBATING BACK AND FORTH WHAT'S. ON A PIECE OF PAPER WHAT THE CHEMICAL ACTUAL DOES AND I ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S HARMFUL NUMBER. ONE AND NOT JUST DRIVEN BY WHATEVER CLUB OF THE DAY IS TRYING TO POSE ITSELF. SO I'M JUST MAKING A STATEMENT I THINK WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF ONE OFFS TYPES PIECE OF LEGISLATION COME THROUGH ARE WE GOING. TO TAKE THAT ROLE THAT'S THE ROLE WE WANT TO TAKE AND I I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SCIENTISTS COMING YEAR TELLS. FACTUALLY WHAT THEY'VE STUDIED IN WHAT THE PRODUCTS ACTUALLY DUE TO PEOPLE SO. FOR THAT REASON I'M GONNA BE OPPOSE IN THE BILL. AND I THINK WE NEED TO YOU KNOW. MORE COMMONSENSE APPROACH AND NOT DO THESE ONE OFFS AND AND I THINK IT WILL BE BETTER SO WE CAN ACTUALLY GO OUT TARGETS THAT YOU SAY THIS IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING TO YOU IF YOU HANDLE THIS PRODUCT. NOW I KNOW THAT MY BUSINESS THAT I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS THAT CAUSE CANCER. THE STATE CALPERS AS A COST CANCERS PROP SIXTY FIVE WHICH IS BEEN STUDY HAS BEEN POSTED THERE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND JUST FOR THAT STATEMENT I'D LIKE. TO WAY AND I'VE I HOPE THEY NEVER KICK ME OFF THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I ACTUALLY LOVE THIS KIND OF STUFF AND IT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO GOOD WORK IF SOMEBODY IS IF WE DON'T KNOW THE INFORMATION WE SHOULD GET THAT INFORMATION SO. FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE OPPOSE IN THIS PIECE LEDGES AND MANY OTHERS THAT COME TROUGH HERE. THAT ARE DRIVEN NOT OFF OF GOOD SCIENCE DATA. THANK YOU FOR THE FOLLOW UP ON YOUR ON YOUR COMMENT -- I THERE IS AN INTERESTING DISTINCTION WE WE KEEP MISSING BE PLEASANT BPA IN THE SAME BREATH. BPA IS A PROP SIXTY FIVE LISTED CHEMICAL BBSS NOT -- CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO YEAH WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP THEY CAN SPEAK TO OKAY YES. AND WHILE HE'S COMES UP AND IN JUST OF MY COLLEAGUE WE START ON U. S. CAME TOGETHER IN THE ASSEMBLY -- IF YOU JUST FOCUS ON THE WASTE PIECE OF IT. THIS IS JUST THE SAME TO CONSUMER IF. I DON'T WANT THAT PIECE OF PAPER YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GIVE IT TO ME I'VE BEEN IN SO MANY RETAILERS SITUATIONS WHERE. I DON'T WANT THAT RECEIPT THE PRINTED OUT IN THE THROAT IN THE IN THE TRASH SO I GUESS THEY'RE MORE EFFICIENT ABOUT FOR WORKING IN THE TRASH. BUT THEY JUST DID SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T NEED WE DON'T NEED AND THEN IT GOES INTO OUR WASTE REMAINS IS UNNECESSARY SO I THINK IF YOU JUST LOOK AT JUST THAT PIECE OF IT. EMPOWERING THE CONSUMERS TO NOT BE FORCED TO TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER THAT'S TOXIC BUT THEY DON'T WANT. THAT THAT'S THE CRUX OF THIS. TO ALLOW YOUR ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP ON THE DPA VERSES BE PS DISTINCTION YES BPA IS THE ONLY ONE ON THE PROP SIXTY FIVE LISTED SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANT IT'S AN AND CAN DISRUPTOR. IT IS HAS ESTROGENIC EFFECTS THAT MIMIC THAT CHEMICAL IN YOUR ABOUT HORMONE IN YOUR BODY WHETHER YOU'RE MALE OR FEMALE. BAD NEWS BE PS IS TURNING INTO WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE CLASSIC REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION. I JUST PULLED UP HERE IN THE AUDIENCE -- TWENTY FOURTEEN REPORT FROM A IN SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SAYING IS BE PSA FOR AND THEY'RE SAYING ALL THE EARLY DAD IS IT'S NOT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT HAS MORE MOAN LIKE ESTROGENIC EFFECTS IN THE BODY AND THEY THINK ONE DAY IT'LL BE PHÃN JUST THE SAME I CAMERA WHICH WAY IT GOES NOW. ONE IS EXTRA EXCRETED MORE RAPIDLY FROM THE BODY PPA VERSES BE PS THE OTHER RESTAURANT ARRESTOR JENNINGS TAX BUT THEY'RE KIND OF APPLES AND ORANGES BUT THE SAME THING IN YOUR BODY. AM I ALSO PUT POINT OUT THAT -- BPA CONTRARY THE SCREWS ME THE WITNESS EARLIER HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE BAD FOR YOUR BODY PPS IS ON ITS WAY THE PROBLEM WITH THE GREEN CHEMISTRY. AT THE TNC IS IT TAKES YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND SO THE STUDIES ARE UNDERWAY ABOUT THE THE S. AND P. P. F. THIS BEING ALL FLUORIDE. THEY ALL APPEAR TO ACT THE SAME IN THE BODY WE THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD JUMP AHEAD OF THE SLOW SCIENCE AND EVEN SLOWER IF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SAY LET'S GET THESE OUT OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THANK YOU. OKAY HI MAN OF A CERTAIN. A YEAR FROM JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS. THAT CAME UP -- REGARDING ALL THE IMPACT ON STATE NO. AND WHETHER. WE ARE GOING TO BE EXEMPTED AS THE STATE SENS FIVE LOTTERY TICKETS WHICH AMEND ARE PRINTED. ON HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM YOU KNOW AGAIN WE WERE SILENT TO IT YEAH AGAIN IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OPPOSITION IS REALLY INTERESTED IN -- WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH HIM ON THAT ISSUE. WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE A FOR ABOUT WASTE AND IT'S ABOUT TIME PUBLIC HEALTH IN TERMS OF THE EMPOWER. ALL ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR CHEMICAL HOUSE ON YOU KNOW OUR BODIES IN THE STATE OUGHT TO BE INVOLVED SO MAYBE TAKE OUT FOR IT. SECONDLY I THINK THAT FOR MYSELF -- MOST RECENTLY I HAD TO RETURN A NUMBER OF THINGS AND I'VE BEEN ASKED FOR A RECEIPT. IF I DIDN'T ASK FOR THE RECEIPT WHEN I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN TROUBLE. I THINK THAT THAT'S CLEARLY ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES HERE AND THE IMPACT TO THE BRICK AND MORTAR STORES. AND I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO BE GIVEN SOME TIME WHERE THEY COULD ADDRESS HOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TO ENSURE PROOF OF PURCHASE WHEN ITEMS ARE RETURNED I MEAN WHEN YOU HEAR. THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT IS MAKING ON THE STORES WE WE'RE DRIVING BRICK AND MORTA YOU KNOW OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THE OLD GUARD THAT LIKES TO GO TO THE STORE AND SHOP -- I ACTUALLY SEE A LONGER LINES AT THE RETURNED OUSTER PEOPLE WHO'VE ORDER THINGS ONLINE -- AND STORES ARE ACCOMMODATING ABOUT THAT WE ARE PUTTING AWFUL HUGE BURDEN ON THEM IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS SO. I THINK ON ACCOMMODATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED AND I WOULD HOPE GOING FORWARD YOU'LL CONSIDER THAT BECAUSE OF THAT IS. THE SALES TAXES GENERATED ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY. TWO JOBS YOU NAY MEANT -- FOR GOVERNMENTS AND WHERE THEY GET THEIR REVENUES THIS IS A HUGE HERE -- ON OUR OUR OWN ECONOMY AND CERTAINLY OUR RETAIL ECONOMY. PLEASE TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE WHEN I READ THIS I THOUGHT WOW THAT'S A LOT OF TRASH WITHOUT THOSE ARE BY DEGRADABLE WE SHRED I'M IN THAT. YOU KNOW IF THE IF IT'S HUGE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT BUT I THINK. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE THE COMMON DENOMINATOR HERE IS THAT WE ARE HURTING BUSINESS WE ARE HURTING JOBS. AND WE'RE SENDING A HUGE I I GUESS IT'S ALMOST FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ECONOMY OF OUR NATION. OUT OF BUSINESS -- IN PERHAPS A SHORTER TIME THAN YOU WOULD IMAGINE SO THAT'S WHILE BE OPPOSING IT TODAY BUT I APPRECIATETHE FACT THAT YOU LOOK AT THESE THINGS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM AND WE WE NEED TO DO THAT FLOW -- GOOD FOR YOU ON THAT OUT BUT BETTER FOR YOU IF YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND AND CONSIDER SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP. BY OUR FINE FINE RETAIL INDUSTRIES FAIR MANUFACTURES. I'VE ACTUALLY JUST A QUICK COUPLE POINTS OUT AGAIN THE BILL DOESN'T GO INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO WAS SO WEAK THAT PLEA FACTOR THAT IN. WE EXEMPTED OUT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT GROSS UNDER TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WHICH WE THINK BALK EXAM THE HUGE MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ACTUALLY TOOK INTO -- INTO OUR THINKING. IN TERMS OF RESTAURANTS WE WERE VERY SENSE ABOUT RESTAURANTS EVEN THOUGH THEY REMAIN OPPOSED. THAT DAY AGAIN IT'S VERY COMMON FOR THEM 2% A BILL TO YOU SO THAT BILL IS NOT. TOUCHED IN TERMS OF THE BILL WHEN THEY PRESENTED TO YOU OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A PAPER BILL -- AND SO AGAIN -- WE DID NOT. DISALLOW THAT OBVIOUSLY IS JUST BASICALLY IF YOU PAY FOR A CREDIT CARD WHETHER OR NOT THAT CREDIT CARD BILL COMES BACK THE SECOND TIME IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT THAT'S WHERE WE WILL BE A PART. WELL IT'S INTERESTING SOME OF THE RECEIPTS THAT WE GET A LATE FEE FROM OFF. THOSE WHO ARE ON GIVING COUPON SAVING COUPONS. ARE I GET A RECEIPT THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH MONEY I'VE SAVED BY BUYING CERTAIN PRODUCTS ON THE OTHERS THAT'S THE THING IT'S GREAT CONSUMER INFORMATION. THAT WILL BE ELIMINATED. I AM NOT SURE THAT THAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS EITHER IN THE MARKETING THAT OUR RETAILERS DO THAT HELP US MAKE BETTER CHOICES. TO STRETCH THAT DOLLAR THAT WE HAVE FULL OF THE THINGS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED ISSUE GO FORWARD. THAT INFORMATION TERMS OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU SAVE SAY FROM THE GROCERY STORE IS NOT UNLIMITED. IT'S IT'S JUST BASICALLY ALL THE FIVE FEET AFTER THAT IF IF THEIR COUPONS OR PROMOTIONAL SO. THOSE WOULD BE ELIMINATED. IF YOU PUT HIM ON THE BACK OF THE RECEIPT THAT'S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE AGAIN WE'RE ASKING FOR RECEIPT THAT'S NO LONGER THAN THAT THE TRANSACTION INFORMATION. I CAN JUST GET A JUST TO KIND OF ZERO ELEVEN YOU'RE DOING TWO VER DIFFERENT THINGS HERE RIGHT YOU'VE GOT THE ISSUE OF WASTE REDUCTION. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE B. P. A. B. PS -- BAN EFFECTIVELY. AND I GUESS I JUST WANNA HAVE SCRATCH SERVICE LITTLE MORE MAY I HEAR YOU IN TERMS OF EARLY INDICATORS -- BUT THE QUESTION IS DO WE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THIS CONCERN ABOUT ABOUT ONE AWESOME PART OF WHY I WAS PURSUING THE GREEN CHEMISTRY BILL YOU KNOW VERY WELL IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE. A MORE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH -- THE GREEK CAM SHE PROGRAM WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND WHAT DIDN'T HAVE THE KIND OF TOOLS THAT I NEED TO DO THE WORK IT IT NEEDS TO DO. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE THEM THOSE TOOLS AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT INDUSTRIES YEAH Và WANT TO WORK WITH US ON THAT -- YOU KNOW IT THERE ARE CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT ARE. CLEAR IT'S OBVIOUS -- BUT BUT EARLY INDICATORS IS THAT ENOUGH. TO TO DO A ONE OFF BAND. YEAH I THINK -- AS I TESTIFIED EARLIER THE LEGISLATURE CAN AND SHOULD DO ONE OFFS ON OCCASION AND DTS YES HE SUPPORTED AB THIRTEEN NINETEEN THE BPA BAND AND TWENTY ELEVEN SAYING. THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WILL BE MOVING KIND OF SLOWLY FOR THAT WAS FORESHADOWING. AND SAID WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WE SUPPORT THAT AFTER THAT THE STM ANY Q. PASSED AND WAS SIGNED. I THINK IT'S THE SAME THING HERE THERE'S STRONG EVIDENCE NOW ABOUT THE P. S. 81%. OF AMERICANS HAVE BE PS IN THEIR YEAR AND THIRST THAT SAYS NOT JUST BE PSP PS SO I THINK IT WILL BE -- FORMALIZES REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION ONE DAY BY PROP SIXTY FIVE BECAUSE OF THE REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS OF THIS HORMONAL LIKE CHEMICAL IN YOUR BODY. IN THE LEGISLATURE I THINK SOMETIMES HAS TO STEP OUT A LITTLE BIT AHEAD SAY THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE NOW WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR LESS LEAD THE NATION LIKE WE DID WITH BPA. IN BABY BOTTLES AND BY THE WAY BPA THE REASON I CAME UP AND BE PS IS IT IT MAY NOT LEECHES READILY OUT OF PLASTIC BOTTLES. SO YOU SEE BPA FREE DRINKING BOTTLE IS PROBABLY GOT PPS BUT IT'S JUST AS LITTLE MORE RESILIENT TO SIGN IN HOT WATER THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT IN THERMAL PAPER IT'S READILY LEACHED SO THAT'S A DIFFERENT APPLICATION AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT APPLICATION FOR PPS. YEAH I MEAN ALL I ALSO ONE OF THE THING YOU KNOW THAT THAT BOTH BECAME THE PS ARE CONSIDERED CONTAMINANTS BY THE WASTE INDUSTRY WITH THE REST OF THE PAPER RECYCLING STREAM. OF COURSE THERE A LOT OF CONTAMINANTS -- INCLUDING PETE AGREES -- THAT IMPACT THE ABILITY OF US -- YOUR ABILITY -- TO TO YOU KNOW -- TO TO RECYCLE PAPER BUT YEAH THIS IS. THIS IS THE THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE BECAUSE I YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS HERE AND AND I WONDER WHETHER WHERE. WHAT I I I I JUST WANT I I'M I'M I GUESS I'M STRUGGLING WITH LIKE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE? RESPECT THE EXISTING SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE WHICH ARE. AND MAN MADE WHAT MAYBE TODAY WE DON'T FEEL AS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEMS ARE. ARE. ACTIVATED ENOUGH FOR FAST ENOUGH RESPONSIVE ENOUGH AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING THE OTHER BILL AND AND EVEN IF THE BILL PASSES IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FAST ENOUGH FOR ME MANY RESPECTS AND THAT'S WHAT KIND OF LEADS ME IN FAVOR THIS BUT I AM -- I CONTINUE TO BE ABLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ABOUT. THE THE THE THE RIGOR WITH WHICH WE ADDRESS THESE KINDS OF ISSUES SO THE RICHER OFFRAMP FOR THE BILL WAS TO GO THE THE RECEIPT DIRECTION -- BASED ON PRIVACY CONCERNS IN BASED ON CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T NECESSARILY READILY EMBRACE THE HE RECEIVED OFFRAMP THIS WAS A COMPROMISE THAT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE SIMPLY PREPARATIONS TO TO GO FOR THE GPS TO BPA FREE. PAPER I THINK OUR ORIGINAL FOCUS AND OUR OUR FOCUS REMAINS IS THE GOING BACK TO CENTER MY COUNTIES POINT THE PRODUCTION OF THE WASTE. AT THE ACTUAL RECEIPT THAT YOU DON'T NEED THAT YOU DON'T REALLY WANT HOW DO YOU REDUCE THAT AND SO IT'S REALLY THE FOCUS ON THE RECEIPT UPON REQUEST. MAKING SURE THAT THAT CAN BE ACCOMMODATED -- THE COMPROMISE WAS ALSO ALLOWING PEOPLE OF CONSECUTIVE. THESE ARE STORES THAT WANTED TO CONTINUE. TO GIVE RECEIPTS OR ADAM ABOUT RECEIPTS LIKE LIKE THE GROCERS YOU HEARD FROM MISTER MARINO. ON MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT OPTION TO HAVE BPA PPS FREE PAPERS SO AGAIN THAT WAS THAT WAS SORT OF LIKE THE COMPROMISE BUT THE FOCUS WAS REALLY. MAKING SURE THAT EVERY RETAILER WE COULD ACCOMMODATE THE PAPER SEE TOMORROW. RIGHT GET THAT BUT BUT NOW THAT THE BILL DOES. IT DOES IT JUST PRY THE OPTION IT SAYS THAT THE PAPER PROOF OF PURCHASE IF PROVIDED -- SHALL NOT CONTAIN BPA OR BBS CORRECT SO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT AN OPTION. RIGHT SO THAT THAT WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK OFFICE IN THE PREPARATION THAT'S RIGHT. SO SO WE PROVISIONS ADDED THAT IN CORRECT [inaudible] GET MORE [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY -- OKAY WHAT'S YEAH THAT'S THE BUT LET'S IT AS A THAT'S INTERESTING RIGHT THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT MOVE ON THE BILL THE BILL IS A BILL ABOUT WASTE REDUCTION NOW IT'S TURNED INTO A GPS. WE ALL TAKE A MOMENT OF APPROPRIATIONS THAT -- WE HAVE TO ACCEPT AS YOU KNOW. OKAY I'LL JUST LET ALL THE I WOULD JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. ALL RIGHT WELL YOU KNOW LOOK I AND WE ALL OF OUR PROPRIOCEPTIVE YEAH. NO WE DO WE DO -- WELL LOOK I I CERTAINLY YOU KNOW -- APPRECIATE IN SUPPORT. THE BROAD GOALS THAT YOU HAVE HERE I I DO CONTINUE TO RAISE -- CONCERNS ABOUT. THE RIGOR OF OF OF THE THE THAT THAT PARTICULAR [inaudible] A BAND. HI AN INFINITY OF THE INTERPLAY WITH OUR EXISTING RESEARCH AND THE STATE'S REGULATORY APPROACH TO THIS STUFF -- I ALSO HEAR YOU KNOW HERE BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING -- ABOUT. ALL THE DATA WE HAVE SO FAR AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THE YOU KNOW THE PROCESS IS NOT MOVE QUICKLY ENOUGH -- ON THE REGULATORY SIDE AND ON THE SCIENCE SIDE HI THE STATE AGENCIES SO -- COULD I MADE MY COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I I THINK THAT -- TODAY'S DISCUSSION CONTINUES TO RAISE SOME. CONCERNS AND AND MORE THAN HAPPY TO AGAIN YEAR AFTER THE COMMITTEE -- DISCUSS THE PPA PPS FREE ISSUE. AGAIN WE WE WANT WE WANT TO STAY JUST VERY FOCUSED ON THE ON THE WASTE REDUCTION PART WHICH IS. MAKING SURE THAT THAT CONSUMERS HAVE THAT ABILITY TO NOT HAVE A RECEIPT WHEN THEY WALK OUT THE DOOR. OKAY ALL RIGHT I TO MOVE BY CENTER CASKEY -- OTHER QUESTIONS THAT CENSORSHIP IS COLOR.

THANK YOU MISTER YOU'RE YOU'RE VERY WELL AWARE ON FUN. THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE WITH RECYCLING -- EVER SINCE CHINA STOP TAKING OUR RECYCLING WE'VE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME -- KNOWING WHERE EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN OUR BLUE BINS IS GOING. WE USED TO THINK THEY BEGIN RECYCLED NOW CHANCES ARE THEY'RE EITHER GETTING INCINERATED OR GOING TO THE LANDFILL -- A. B. SEVEN NINETY TO ESTABLISH THE TIME FRAME FOR PLASTIC BOTTLE BEVERAGE MANY FACTORS TO USE MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT. IN THEIR PLASTIC BOTTLES WITH THE GOAL OF GETTING 275% RECYCLED CONTENT BY. TWENTY THIRTY WITH THAT I WAS GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY JOINT AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR ONE AND SHE COULD GO TO THE DETAILS. OF THANK YOU MISTER TANG MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- AB SEVEN NINE TWO IS AN IMPORTANT BILLS BOTH TO INCREASE THE CONTENT OF RECYCLED MATERIALS AND BOTTLES BUT ALSO. TO CHANGE THE MARKET WITHIN THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY. TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL WILL BE WORKABLE -- FOR BOTH RECLAIMER SANTA MANUFACTURERS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH TO A CAUGHT IN THIS FROM BROWN UNIVERSITY AND FROM UC SANTA BARBARA. TO ANALYZE THE CURRENT MARKET THEIR INITIAL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE TARGETS IN THE BILL ARE WORKABLE AND THAT THE MARKET WILL ADJUST TO ENSURE THERE IS ADEQUATE SUPPLY. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR ANALYSIS INCLUDES RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO AVOID POTENTIAL MARKET FAILURES ONE OF WHICH IS TO INCREASE RECYCLING DATA TRANSPARENCY MOVING FORWARD -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL ALONG SIDE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING AND THE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. YES WITNESSES. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIA'S AGAINST WASTE AND I THINK THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MADE A REALLY GOOD POINT ABOUT SEXUALLY AND ECONOMIC BILL -- THIS IS A BILL THAT IS DESIGNED TO UPDATE THE ECONOMICS OF RECYCLING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT WE PERCEIVE THAT WERE RECYCLING IS THE THING THAT WE DO AT THE CURBSIDE RECYCLING BIN. AND THE WHOLE SITUATION IN CHINA HAS COMMUNICATED TO US THAT THAT IS NOT RECYCLING. WHAT -- CENTER SKINNER HAS TOLD US SINCE DAY ONE IS THAT RECYCLING IS WHEN SOMEBODY BUYS THE MATERIAL WHEN THERE'S A MARKET FOR THE MATERIAL. AND WE'VE DONE A LOT IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO COMPEL CONSUMERS TO DO MORE ON COLLECTION WE'VE COMPELLED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES TO COLLECT AND PROCESS AND SORT THIS MATERIAL. THE ECONOMY HAS MOTIVATED. INDIVIDUAL ENTREPRENEURS TO SET UP -- PROCESSING TO SHRED AND TO CLEAN THAT MATERIAL BUT ALL OF THAT IS A WASTE OF TIME UNLESS SOMEBODY IS WILLING TO BUY THE MATERIAL. AND THIS BILL IS KIND OF IS THE IS THE CAP ON OUR RECYCLING OBJECTIVES IN TERMS OF COMPELLING THE MANUFACTURES. TO TO BE THE THE FINAL PARTNER IN THIS RECOUP CYCLING EQUATION BY BUYING THE MATERIAL THAT THE CONSUMER HAS DUTIFULLY SET ASIDE FOR RECYCLING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CURBSIDE PROVIDERS HAVE PROVIDED IN SEGREGATED AND SORTED. ALL OF THOSE STEPS IN THE PROCESS REQUIRE AN INCREASED COST THE ONLY WAY TO OFFSET THOSE COSTS IS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS IN THE ECONOMIC COSTS. IS WHEN SOMEBODY IS WILLING TO BUY THAT MATERIAL AT THE END AND USE IT IN INCORPORATING THIS THIS NEW PACKAGE. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT BEVERAGE MANUFACTURES THROUGH IMMENSE A NEW SHOULD'VE AND CREATIVITY AND FORESIGHT HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO PUT? A 100% RECYCLED CONTENT IN A JUICE. PACKAGE 50% 2100% RECYCLED CONTENT IN A WATER PACKAGE -- WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS NOW THE IDEA IS TO COMPEL MANUFACTURES TO DO THIS ACROSS THE BOARD AND EVEN PLAYING FIELD POLICY THAT REQUIRES EVERYONE TO PLAY BY THE SAME RULES. TO DO WHAT THESE MANUFACTURERS OF ARE ALREADY DOING AND TO HELP TO OFFSET THE COST RECYCLING SO THIS IS THE NATURAL NEXT STEP. IN TERMS OF CONTROLLING OUR OWN DESTINY IN OUR RECYCLING FUTURE. AND WE WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. HI MY NAME IS ALEX DEL LINCOLN OUR COMPANY VERTICAL RECYCLING WHICH IS BASED IN SOUTH GATE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRODUCERS. OF FOOD GRADE RECYCLE PT PLASTICS. TOGETHER WAS OTHER CALIFORNIA COMPANY MEMBERS OF OUR CALIFORNIA RECYCLING COALITION WE HAVE INVESTED TENS OF MILLIONS. INTO CALIFORNIA RECYCLING ECONOMY CREATED OVER ONE THOUSAND GREEN JOBS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO MEET. EVER MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS OF BEVERAGE COMPANIES AND TODAY YOU CAN FIND BEVERAGE CONTAINERS MADE FROM 100% ARE PASSED ON THE SHELVES. OF OF OUR STORES. THESE PLASTIC BOTTLE CONTAINING RECYCLED BG CAN BE -- PROCESS BACK INTO BEVERAGE CONTAINERS MANY TIMES OVER AND THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES CARBON FOOTPRINT OF PLASTIC PACKAGING IN EL ELIMINATES LARGE AMOUNTS OF NON RECYCLABLE PLASTIC WASTE. HOWEVER OUR INDUSTRY IS IN CRISIS AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST. SEVEN EIGHT YEARS JESS IS AS IN STATE CAPACITY TO PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY FOOD GRADE RECYCLE BG HAS INCREASED. TO THIS DATE OUR PRODUCT WHICH IS RECYCLE P. T. IS CONSIDERED BY THE BRAND OWNERS AND BEVERAGE CONTAINER MANUFACTURERS TO BE A COMMODITY. AND WE HAVE TO COMPETE ON PRICE WITH THE HYDROCARBON BASED VERSION PT INDUSTRY. INCREASING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION AND SUBSIDIZED IMPORTS OF VIRGIN RESIN HAVE LED TO LOWER COMMODITY PRICES. VIRGIN BT PRICES ARE LOWER TWO DAYS AND THEY WERE A TEN YEARS AGO. NO SUSTAINABLE PLASTICS RECYCLING INDUSTRY CAN BE BUILT WITHOUT SUSTAINABLE DEMAND. THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TWENTY AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS INTO RENEWABLE ENERGY HAD THE FIRST LARGE SCALE SOLAR POWER PLANTS HAD TO COMPETE ON PRICE WAS COAL POWER GENERATION. WE NEED ROBUST PLASTICS RECYCLING INDUSTRIES IT THAT WOULD UTILIZE SUPPLY GENERATED IN THE STATE AND WOULD MANUFACTURE PRODUCT USED IN THE STATE. PLASTICS RECYCLING COMPANIES ARE ALWYS OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY IN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO WHAT'S BEST STANDARDS OF CIRCLE OUR ECONOMY. TO THAT EXTENT WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE WILLINGNESS OF THE LARGEST BOTTLED WATER COMPANIES TO WORKS WITH US. TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE YET MEANINGFUL MATTER TO RECYCLE CONTENT TARGETS FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS MANY OF WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THAT YOU'LL HAVE WE KNOW THIS IS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA CLIMATE GREEN JOBS AND OF WOULD. ADD YIELD LESS LANDFILL IN WATER WEIGHT PLASTIC POLLUTION FOR THOSE REASONS WILL CONTINUE TO WORKS WITH AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND WE AT ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OF AB SEVENTY SEVEN NINE TWO TODAY [inaudible] THANK YOU -- FOLKS ONE ADAM IN SUPPORT [inaudible] MISTER CHAIRMAN MY ON A MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE POLITICS READ I ON BEHALF OF THE PLASTIC RECYCLER RECLAIMER -- PROCESSOR COALITION INCLUDES FOR DECO CARBON LIKE GREEN FIBER PENINSULA. RE PAT MARYLAND H. P. -- HPC AND PENTAX WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORTED THANK YOU [inaudible] THE KIDS. THIS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PRAYER WITH A PRIME A KELLY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC. SERVICES WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD AND HELPING CREATE A MARKET FOR RECYCLED PLASTIC WE DRIVE UP.

TELL TRYING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LEAGUE CONSERVATION BORDERS IN SUPPORT. OR BRONTE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL NORTHERN DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. JIM WHEN BURKE ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION TO CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY -- ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT AND MOVIES HERE FROM OPPOSITION. WITH ONE OF HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. L. TO THE IT WAS MORE. WE HAVE THE PLASTIC RECYCLING CORPORATION CALIFORNIA THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION MANAGED IN A CELL BE ANI UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST OPPOSE THIS. BILL UNLESS IT IS AMENDED WE PROVIDED US SOME. RECOMMENDATIONS ON ON HOW TO AMEND THAT. THE BILL IS THAT PROVIDES BASICALLY UNREALISTIC GOALS AND TIMELINES FOR THE RECYCLED CONTENT MANDATE. I DO WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE STAFF ON THE TIME THEY PUT INTO THIS AND LOOK AT THE ECONOMICS AND AND THAT AND FRANKLY. A TRYING TO MINIMIZE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE MARKETS AS THE THE AUTHORS AND THE PROPONENTS BUT THE DISCUSSED. THIS IS A BILL ABOUT. MARKETS ABOUT TRYING TO CHANGE MARKETS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CHINESE SOARED P. E. T. WAS NOT IMPACTED. SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE CHINESE STORE THERE WAS NO P. E. T. THAT WENT INTO LANDFILLS. ON MARKET MORE TALK ABOUT US THE CHINESE SORT THAT'S THREE THREE SEVEN SO WHEN WE LOOK AT PT THAT IS A A GLOBAL MARKET. AND SO THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT WILL CALIFORNIA'S NUMBERS IN THIS MANDATE WHICH AGAIN WE SUPPORT A MANDATE -- WITH RECYCLED CONTENT BUT AGAIN WELL MEASURED APPROACH AND OF WAR SHORTER TERM TIMELINE. THE WHAT'S THAT GOING TO DO A ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO WE WOULD SAY. LET'S START THE OF THE THE MANDATE AND LET'S GET IT ROLLING AND GO THROUGH. TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THEN AFTER THAT THERE'S OTHER BILLS ARE GOING TO HEAR TODAY -- TEN EIGHTY AND THAT'S ANOTHER SIDE BILLS THAT WILL TAKE OVER THE OUT YEARS AND MINIMIZE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. SO. MOM WE SUPPORT. ME PT IS A RECYCLING SUCCESS. THIS. TALK ABOUT BOX WATERS BETTER ABOUT THIS UPSTAIRS IN OUR DEAL IN THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT THIS IS BETTER. THIS IS SEVENTY SIX RECITE PERCENT RECYCLE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN WEBSITE. THIS BOTTLE IS 1100% RECYCLED. THIS BOTTLE IS NOT REALLY RISKS ARE BOXES NOT REALLY RECYCLED IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THIS BOXES RECYCLE OUT A 75% RATE. THIS BOX IS ALSO NOT COMPOSED DOUBLE ZERO COURT IN THE WEBSITE IS ZERO POSSIBLE IF YOU LOOK INTO IT NO PASSED AROUND. IT HAS METAL ON THE INSIDE FOOTBALL BOX WATER BUT IS BETTER IS A GREAT TRADE MARK. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT REALITY SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE REALITIES OF THE ROWS OF PT VERSES THREE THROUGH. SEVEN THE REALITIES OF THE MARKETS AND WHAT THIS IS GOING TO GOING FORWARD WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE SHOULD PROP UP THE MARKET. TO GET TO GO ON HEALTH RECLAIM RESULT THE P. R. C. C. HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS IN TRYING TO BUILD DOMESTIC MARKETS A CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE TWO PRODUCTS AND THE VAST MAJORITY NINETIES PERCENT PLUS. E. T. RECYCLE CALIFORNIAN AND PRODUCED CALIFORNIA. STAYS A CALIFORNIA GOES. TO TO MARKETS BOTTLES AND FOOD PACKAGING. THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT WE MAKE IN CALIFORNIA HERE. AND SO WE DO HAVE A CLOSED LOOP AND WISH THEN ABSOLUTELY. WELL FOOD PACKAGING AGAIN WILL BE MORE IMPACT BY TEN EIGHTY THE BOTTLES. OF WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSE THAT LOOP EVEN MORE MORE AND AGAIN WE SUPPORT. MOVING FORWARD WITH A MORE MEASURED APPROACH. SIMILAR TO THE E. U. THE E. YOU STUDIED THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY WENT THROUGH -- AND DID YOU KNOW ECONOMIC MODELS AND CREATED A MODEL THAT SAID BASICALLY 25% BY TWENTY A TWENTY FIVE AND 30% BY. TWENTY THIRTY THOSE TYPES OF NUMBERS ARE ARE REALISTIC AND WE LOOK AT THE MEMBERS THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION MANY OF THEM HAVE SIGNIFICANT PLEDGES. AND AND WE STAND BY THAT THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT A MOVING. SOMETHING FORWARD THAT HAS A MORE MEASURED APPROACH. BUT THERE'S OTHER. INDEPENDENT BALL SKEWS ME STORE BRANDS AT THAT HAVE. ZERO AT THIS POINT SO TO GET TO THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IN THIS BILL OR SUGGESTED BY THE CONSULTANT IN ONE YEAR ONE YEAR. OF FROM ENACTMENT IT WILL CREATE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR ALL PLAYERS IN THE INDUSTRY BOTH THE BOTTLER. BUT THE RECYCLER THE THE RECLAIMER AND THEN FINALLY BEFORE WE GET DONE WE'VE ALSO SEEN. SOME OF THE ENTITIES ARE ON THE FRONT AND REAR REDUCED IN AND COLLECTED MATERIAL SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND HOW MUCH MATERIAL WE COULD GET COLLECTED THE E. U.. HAS A GOAL OF 90% A COLLECTION WORDS SEVENTY FIVE BUT WE'RE STILL A SUCCESS STORY THAT'S PROP THAT'S THE BEST COLLECTION RATE. IN THE UNITED STATES AND A BETTER THAN EVEN A EUROPE ON PT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE CONTENT AS A WHOLE SO WE'RE DOING WELL WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO BETTER? WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CLOSE THE LOOP BUT WE NEED TO AVOID UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH MARKETS IF AGO TOO QUICK TOO FAST TOO EARLY WE WILL SKEW THE MARKETS. AND MAKE ENCOURAGEMENT TO ACTUALLY FOR BOTTLE MANUFACTURED ACTUALLY O OUTSIDE. AND SOURCE MATERIAL FROM FROM OTHER PLACES RATHER THAN IN CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN WE SUPPORT SPECIALLY THE PLASTIC CYCLE CORPORATION CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS THE CALIFORNIA MARKET AND HAS FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY CANOE TIME TO HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL BOTTLED WATER ASSOCIATION -- A JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS -- WE SUPPORT THE MINOTAUR RECYCLE APPROACH IN THIS BILL -- THAT'S RELATIVELY NEW FOR US THIS IS A VERY CHALLENGING ISSUE -- AND OUR PRIMARY OBJECTION TO THE BILL AS IT IS JUST TOO MUCH TOO FAST -- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DEEP IN IT -- I I DIDN'T BRING ANY -- OF VISUAL AIDS I WILL MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN ALL OF BRING SOME NEXT TIME APOLOGIZE AND WE WANT YOU TO REDUCE WASTE OIL THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT BUT NOW APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE STORY. BUT BUT A YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE GOOD WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN INCREASING USE RECYCLING. IS BY OUR MEMBERS AND IT'S KIND OF IT'S IT'S BREAKING ITS PATH BREAKING ITS ITS ITS QUALITY WORK. ON WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A STATUTORY MANDATE THAT EVERYBODY ACHIEVE. KIND OF OUT LIAR RESULTS AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE PIECE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO NAVIGATE AND TO TRY TO HELP WITH THIS. WE SAT DOWN TO SOME OF THE LARGEST PURCHASERS OF THEM RECYCLE MATERIAL WITH THE PROVIDERS AND CAME UP WITH A FRAMEWORK AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THING THAT WE THINK BEST INFORMS THIS AND WE ALSO THINK THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE E. U. AND I I HAVE. TO I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THAT THE E. YOU LOOK AT THIS FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME. AND ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE NEAR OUR MINDS AS FOLKS THAT DO THIS KIND OF EVERY DAY WE CAN'T WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY OUR OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS WE THINK THAT THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE PUT TOGETHER -- ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS PART OF THAT FRAMEWORK -- WE CAME UP WITH -- 25% -- BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE THINK THAT THAT IS DOABLE WE ALSO THINK THAT THE MARKET WOULD HAVE TO OPERATE INKIND OF UNPRECEDENTED LEE. EFFICIENT AND OTHER WAYS TO EVEN HIT THAT NUMBER AND SO -- THAT'S WHAT WE CAME UP YOU IS OBVIOUSLY I THINK SUPPORTS OUR FRAMEWORK. THIS IS AN ECONOMIC APPROACH AND AND IT SEEMS TO US TO BE HEAVILY HEAVILY HEAVILY A YOU KNOW KIND OF PUSHED ON THE DEMAND SIDE WE'RE WE'RE NOT SEEING THE SAME LEVEL OF ATTENTION. AND AFFECT ON THE SUPPLY SIDE NOT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IN THE THE LAST LITTLE WHILE WE'VE HAD SOME SOME -- HOPEFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH THE AUTHORS -- AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO KIND OF ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND REALLY REALLY DIGGING INTO THE DETAILS THE NUMBERS THE TIME LINES THE PENALTIES -- AND SOME OF THE OTHER FACTORS OF THIS KIND OF VERY COMPLEX AND VERY INVOLVED BILL -- AND WITH THAT WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME SOME. GOOD WORK TO BE DONE AT THAT STILL LEFT TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU TO MY THANK YOU. OTHER BOOKS ONE ACT I DON'T OPPOSITION A RAISE CONCERNS. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS THERE THOMAS WITH NIAGARA BOTTLING WE'RE OPPOSED TO AB SEVEN NINE TWO IN ITS CURRENT FORM BUT SUPPORT THE ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORK BY THE BOTTLE WATER INDUSTRY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE TERM MEMBERS JOE ACT ON BEHALF THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION -- WERE OPPOSE BECAUSE OF THE ANA CAN'T UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ON THE MARKET THAT BEEN OUTLINED AND THE ALSO BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE ANY IN A MORE MEASURED APPROACH THANK YOU. IF CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM REGULAR BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BUT LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THINKS AUTHORS. THROUGH THE USE OF THE CALIFORNIA THE PRODUCERS IN OPPOSITION. MR MEMBERS JOHN HERE ON BEHALF GROCERY MANUFACTURERS OPPOSE FOR THE REASON STATE. SOME OF YOU GUYS GET YOUR LETTERS AND HAVE ABOUT ALL THOSE. GROUPS WERE LISTEN OPPOSITION -- THANK YOU OKAY -- OTHER FOLKS WHEN ADAM AND OPPOSITION A RAISE CONCERNS NOW SEEN IN ITS -- AT THE WE BRING TO THE BACK TO COMMITTEE. CENTER WILL CASKEY. FIRST I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE THE AUTHORS AND BRINGING THE MATTER FORWARD I THINK IT BILLS ON SB ONE SIX EIGHT YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT THAT WAS A SMALL IT WAS UNFORTUNATE COULDN'T GET APPROVED OVER IN THE OTHER HOUSE I'M WONDERING IF THE THE MIND. SENATOR ASKING ON PAGES EIGHT AND NINE OF OUR ANALYSIS THE TALK ABOUT -- SOME. AN AMENDMENT LETTUCE LANGUAGE ABOUT TWEAKING THE TIMELINE -- CLEAR FIND THE MINIMUM CONTENT STANDARDS I WAS WONDERING THE AUTHORS THOUGHTS ON ON THAT -- INPUT. WE WE WE ACCEPTED I THINK THAT COMMITTEES IN MINNESOTA WE'RE STILL. ARE THESE THE ONE THAT WE ACCEPT YES. OKAY AS I DID I MISS THAT THEN THE NEXUS ON THE TIME. TO JUST CLEAR FOR TIMELINE WAS CHANGED. YEAH MEDIUM AND IT WAS ON TIMELY OKAY SO WE GOT ANOTHER YEAR ON TWENTY FIVE I'M. ON THE PENALTIES. ON IT TALKS ABOUT COULD FIND A MINIMUM CONTENT STANDARDS ARE NOT MEASURED IN THE AGGREGATE THE UNPAID SEVEN IN THE HOUSE AS WE TALK ABOUT PENALTIES ARE. PER BOTTLE VERSUS THE WEIGHT -- IN. THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS SORT OF PUTS IT ON THE AUTHORS ABOUT REVISING REVIVING THE WEIGHT AND THE PER BOTTLE PENALTY. IS THAT ALSO INCLUDED OR SAT. STATUS QUO YEAH SENATE THIS RECOMMENDATION. BECAUSE IT SEEMS IT TALKS ABOUT THE AMBITIOUS NATURE OF THE BILL -- AT LEAST THROUGH THE END OF THE DECADE MIGHT REQUIRE SOME. OF THE TO GET PEOPLE GOING THE BILL ALSO GET GIVEN YOUR WORK FROM LAST YEAR AS WELL AS WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE I THINK WE ARE STILL HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN FIND A COMPROMISE WITH ALL THE OPPOSITION [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THAT'S AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'LL BE WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU THE QUESTION FAST FROM THE MEMBERS YES SIR SKINNER. I'M THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE A BILL THAT FINALLY NOT FINALLY BECAUSE WE'VE HAD OTHERS BUT STILL THAT THIS IS FOCUSED ON MARKETS AND OF WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM -- REPRESENTED FROM CALIFORNIA WASTE ABOUT THE FACT THAT -- RECYCLING IS NOT PUTTING SOMETHING IN A BEEN JUST ISN'T AN UNLESS WE HAVE MARKETS SO IT'S NOT JUST THE PURCHASE OF THE STUFF WE SHOULD READ HER BAIL. IT IS THE REMANUFACTURE OF IT INTO A PRODUCT THAT IS RECYCLING IT'S A LOOP. AND UNLESS THE LOOP IS CLOSED WE DON'T HAVE ANY RECYCLING. SO WE KNOW NOW. RIGHT NOW WE'RE SORT OF FIXATED BECAUSE A CHINA BUT ACTUALLY WE'VE NOT HAD A CLOSED LOOP FOR EVEN PRIOR TO THAT. AND WE'VE HAD AND I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE SO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE SO DEDICATED TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN OUR OUR PUBLIC TAKE UP RATE. OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE RECYCLING WHICH IS PUTTING IN A BIN IS PHENOMENAL IT'S GREAT. BUT WE HAVEN'T THEN DELIVERED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SENDING THE RIGHT. ECONOMIC SIGNALS ARE MARKET SIGNALS TO INSURE THAT THAT MATERIAL THAT EVERYBODY PUTS IN THE BIN GETS RE MANUFACTURED. NOW YEARS AGO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN CALIFORNIA ADOPTED AB NINE THIRTY NINE WHICH WAS EIGHTY NINE I BELIEVE -- WE WERE VERY FIXATED THAT WE NEEDED MARKETS AND THERE WAS DIFFERENT EFFORTS INCLUDING EFFORTS TO REQUIRE WHICH PASSED REQUIRE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PAPER WE PURCHASED HAD TO HAVE AN MINIMUM POST CONSUMER RECYCLED CONTENT BECAUSE WE KNEW WE HAD TO SEND THAT SIGNAL IF WE LOOK AT OUR JURISDICTIONS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE MANY OF THEM HAVE RULES AROUND THEIR OWN PREACHER PROCUREMENT. THAT THEY BY MINIMUM A RECYCLED CONTENT AND FOR IN THE DURING THAT TIME THERE WAS. NOT ENOUGH MANUFACTURING IN U. S. OF THAT USED THE SECONDARY MATERIALS BUT THERE WAS ROBUST MANUFACTURING. BUT LIKE SO MUCH ELSE OF THEIR MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN U. S.. WE'VE WITH THE IT'S DIMINISH SO IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS FAR LESS MANUFACTURING. IN THE U. S. THAT WILL TAKE A SECONDARY MATERIAL AND RE MANUFACTURE IT. PARTLY WHY BECAUSE WE'VE NOT SENT THE RIGHT MARKET SIGNALS NOW WE HAPPEN TO HAVE COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT DO YOU. PURCHASE THESE PLASTICS AND WILL RE MANUFACTURED THERE'S FEWER THAN THERE USED TO BE BUT WE HAVE THEM HERE. AND WHY SHOULDN'T WE HELP SUPPORT THEM. AND RATHER AND SO THAT THEY CAN COMPETE FAIRLY WITH THIS VIRGIN RESIN -- BECAUSE WE HAVE THE GOALS MEANING WE HAVE THE 75% GOAL FOR QUOTE UNQUOTE RECYCLING SO WORK COLLECTING THAT MUCH OF THE MATERIAL SO TO CLOSE THE LOOP WE HAVE TO MAKE THE MARKET SIGNAL. NOW WE HAVE SEEN AS CALIFORNIA INCREDIBLE SUCCESS WITH GOOD MARKET SIGNALS. THE RENEWABLE ENERGY WAS ONE OF THE NOTIONS THAT WAS CITED WEEK THE PRICE FOR A KILOWATT HOUR EVERY NEW BILLY GENERATED ELECTRICITY COMPETES FIND WITH EVERY OTHER GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY. PARTLY DUE TO THE APPROPRIATE MARKET SIGNALS THAT CALIFORNIA ENACTED -- EVEY IS HAVE COME DOWN IN PRICE AGAIN PARTLY DUE TO THE MARKET SIGNALS THAT CALIFORNIAN ACTED. THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE GOT TO ADOPT POLICIES TO SEND THOSE APPROPRIATE MARKET SIGNALS. NOW WHILE I CAN'T NECESSARILY GUARANTEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE. IN COUNTRY YOU'RE IN STATE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES -- COME ABOARD BUT IF IT DOES ALL THE BETTER BECAUSE THEN WE ARE CLOSING THE LOOP RIGHT HERE AND WE'RE EVEN REDUCING. THE ALL THE EMISSIONS RELATED TO SHIPPING IT OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL IT IS A GREAT MOVE IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO THAT CALIFORNIA'S. GOALS AROUND RECYCLING ARE REAL BECAUSE WE ARE ACTUALLY CLOSING THE LOOP AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT [inaudible] THIRTY DOLLARS. THANK YOU CHAIR. SO WE HAVE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT I AGREE I WANT I WANT TO CLOSE THE TWO I THINK THIS GREAT I THINK CALIFORNIA. IS A LEADER [inaudible] BUT IT WAS CITED IN SOME OF THE TESTIMONY ABOUT YOU KNOW BASICALLY WE FORCED. RENEWABLES AND ENERGY. BUT TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING IS TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING. WE ARE PRODUCING IT IS THE KNOWLEDGE I WANT TO BRING SO I CAN COME BACK TO THIS BILL. WE'RE OVER PRODUCING SOLAR ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE STILL INCENTIVIZE IT WERE STILL PUSHING THAT FORWARD. AND SO THE OUR LEADER BUT OUR COST OF ENERGY IS HIGHER THAN MOST ANY PLACE IN THE NATION. SO I THINK WE SHOULD INCENTIVIZE BUT ALSO HEARD THE OPPOSITION WHO JUST SAID HATE LIST THUS THUS DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY THE RIGHT WAY IS NOT FORED INTO A GOAL THAT IS VERY HARD FOR THEM TO MEET. SO THAT WE PUSH IT OUT OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IF WE WANT TO BE A LEADER IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO BRING INDUSTRY ALONG WITH THIS. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO I HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY WOULD DON'T WANT THAT THAT IT'S ABOUT A PERCENTAGE SO LET'S TRY TO GET TO THAT PERCENTAGE WHERE THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH IT. AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS SO THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN'T DO THE RIGHT THING AND LEAD -- AND SHOW BY EXAMPLE TO THE REST OF YOU KNOW. PEOPLE WHO ARE HER NOT DOING THIS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. SO IF WE CAN PUT THAT LOU AND CLOSE THAT LOOP -- AND ACTUALLY DO IT IN A WAY WHERE WE DON'T PUSH BUSINESS OUT OF CALIFORNIA ANY WE I HAVE BOTTLERS IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE OPPOSE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF THE PERCENTAGE IN THIS BILL. SO ARE YOU WILLING -- TO LOOK AT THAT NUMBER AND GET IT TERM SOMEPLACE WHERE THEY CAN CAN'T COME ON AND SAY HEY LOOK WITH US DO THIS AND ARE SPREAD OUT OVER TIME SO THAT WE DON'T. PUSH THAT INDUSTRY OUT OF CALIFORNIA OR DRIVE THE COST UP TO WHERE IT IS COULD NOT CAN ACTUALLY BE A PRODUCTIVE. AND AND MEET THE GOAL. NO I I JUST WANNA MAKE UP FIRST I APPRECIATE -- THE SKINNER AND ARE KIND OF HER A HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT EVERYBODY THAT WAS SITTING UP HERE WAS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND WE HAVE BEEN. HAVING VERY GOOD NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF THE MANDATE WE ARE JUST WORKING WITH THE NUMBERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. COME TO SOME SORT OF NUMBER THAT PUSHES THEM A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT THEY CAN AGREE WITH ALAN -- TO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK SO FAR AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS -- THAT WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS AND CLOSE THE LOOP. THIRD I ACTUALLY I THINK WE WANT TO HELP SO -- HAPPY TO WORK WITH AND WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE THE INITIAL OFFER FROM THE OPPOSITION WAS 25% BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YOU HEARD OPPOSITION FROM NIAGARA NIAGARA TODAY TODAY NOT TOMORROW TODAY'S ALREADY AT 40%. NESTLE IS AT 37% AND THOSE ARE THE TWO LARGEST BOTTLED WATER COMPANIES IN THE STATE. ALSO IN ADDITION 50% OF OUR PET IS GOING OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE WE ABSOLUTELY. AGAIN THE RICHES OF ONE OF THE OF THE PLASTICS IS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN WE WOULD LIKE TO BE THE SINGLE WE WANT TO KEEP IN CALIFORNIA. WE WANT A REALISTIC PERCENTAGE BUT IT'S ODD WHEN. YOU AGAIN YOU HAVE THE TWO LARGEST. BOTTLE WATER MANUFACTURES ALREADY WELL ABOVE THE 25% SAYING. HEY THE INDUSTRY CAN GET THERE TILL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE NOW ONE OF THE REASONS IS THERE'S A LIMITED SUPPLY THAT'S RIGHT SO YOU GARY GO AHEAD. I PLEASE ALSO PART PART OF IT IS WE HAVE TO COLLECT MORE SO WITH TO DO BETTER COLLECTION WEEK IF WE CAN GO HIGHER THE 75% ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AS SOME OF THE RECYCLE PLASTIC IS GOING TO OTHER USES SO IF WE CAN LIMITED TO BEVERAGE BOTTLES I THINK WE'RE ALL VERY VERY OPEN TO THAT -- BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE BY PUSHING THIS CONTENT THERE WILL BE MORE DEMANDING PART PART OF WHAT WHAT ALEX DIDN'T SAY IS. THERE'S THIS COMMON OF WATER SUPPLY HE'LL HE'LL TELL HIS BUSINESS OF THE STRUGGLE. SO WE HAVE MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE STRUGGLING BUSINESSES WHO WANT TO DO MORE RECYCLED PLASTIC THERE HASN'T BEEN AS MUCH A MARKET BECAUSE OF THE PRICING. BETWEEN. VIRGIN PLASTIC AND RECYCLE PLASTIC SO AGAIN WE WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO FIND A PERCENTAGE BUT AGAIN WHEN THE OPENING OFFER. IS A PERCENT THAT'S SIX YEARS EIGHT YEARS SEVEN YEARS OUT AND THAT YOU HAVE MANY OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURES READY MAKING IT. COCA COLA JUST BY CONTRAST SAYS IN EUROPE THE GOOD 250% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CALL NOW THEY HAVE A SAID THAT IN NORTH AMERICA CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY'RE SAYING THAT IN EUROPE SO SO AGAIN WE WE WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERCENTAGE MAKES SENSE BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO BE TAKEN. FOR YOU ALSO CREATE A WHEN YOU MANDATE IT SO THESE THE DO ANY MANDATE THAT AMOUNT. IT INCREASE IT CREATES. THEY HAVE TO GO GET IT AND IF THE VET SUPPLIES OUT THERE AND IT'S DRIVES THE PRICE THAT WE SAW THAT WHEN THE BIOMASS INDUSTRY JUST LAST TWO YEARS AND WE FORCED THEM TO TAKE A CERTAIN. PERCENTAGE AND THEN THEY'RE ALL COMPETING FOR THAT CERTAIN PERCENTAGE WHEN THERE'S OTHERS OF OTHER VEHICLE SO IT HAS TO BE BALANCED AND I KNOW YOU'RE MADE SO I I WANT THIS TO WORK. AYE AYE AYE BUT WE'VE GOT A IT'S GOT TO WORK SO THAT WE DON'T DRIVE THEM OUT OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE KEEP THOSE HERE WE ACTUALLY OUR MODEL FOR THE ORLD. TOTALLY GREEN I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE OFFRAMP THAT WE DESIGNED THE LOWER PERCENTAGES. IS REALLY HAVE SORT OF CAL RECYCLE BE ABLE TO FLIP THAT SWITCH ON AND OFF SINCE IF YOU REALLY DO HAVE. A SUPPLY ISSUE THAT WE'RE MONITORING YOU KNOW SIX YEARS OUT THANK YOU CAN HAVE CAL RECYCLE SAY OKAY. YOU KNOW WORKABLE GONNA FLIP IT OFF SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE WE ARE OPEN. TO NEGOTIATING SO THAT THE SOMEONE IS MONITORING I THINK IT IS. DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING BASS MAKE SIX OR YOU KNOW EIGHT YEARS OUT. TO TO KNOW EXACTLY THE RIGHT PERCENTAGE WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO HAVE AN OFFER. WHICH WHICH THAT OFFRAMP GOING TO BE. REGULATED BY. THE WAY SUPPORT. WHO'S GONNA DO WHAT I THINK AT THIS POINT. THE WAY WE HAD ENVISIONED THE AND THAT'S WHO WE ARE PROBABLY -- OF LOOK AT AS WELL. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF WAY SPORTS ARE. OFF THE FIELD YES AND AND AND AND MY JOINT AUTHORS SAY AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE ALSO CONSULTING WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT THE OFFRAMP SHOULD BE AS WELL. SO WE WE HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS IS YOUR TRYING. TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AS WELL. I WANTED -- TO WE WANT WE WOULD LOVE TO PARTICIPATE NOT OFFRAMP CONVERSATION AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN YOUR A CO AUTHOR JOIN AUTHOR ON THE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIZED VERSION OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. ON PLASTICS WRIT LARGE WILL BE PRESENTING LATER TODAY -- BUT I I THINK IT'S I I WOULD SAY THE MOST COMPELLING ARGUMENTS AND BROUGHT UP TO ME WITH THE REST THIS PARTICULAR BILL FROM THE OPPOSITION HAS JUST BEEN. AND IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU TALK TO COVER CYCLE AND EVERYBODY AGREES OF THESE. THE STANDARDS ARE AGGRESSIVE BUT I THINK THE THOUGHT IS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE HOW WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND STILL GROWING. TO A FACTUAL -- EIGHT MY TIRE RECYCLING RATES AND AND RECYCLE CONTENT RATES -- BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY. AND I THINK THE COUNCIL BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT PLACE. TO KNOW THOSE OF THOSE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AS THE ONES ARE GONNA BE IMPLEMENTING SB FIFTY FOUR A. B.. TEN EIGHTY IF THOSE PASS AND AND THAT MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NOT CONFLICT IN THAT WE DON'T ALSO CREATE. I SERIES A BY PRODUCT IN THE MARKETS IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO THE THE PROPER RECYCLING WASTE REDUCTION AGENDA AND SO. I'D LOVE. TO THE BILL PASSES OUT TODAY LOVE TO WORK CLOSELY BETWEEN OUR COMMITTEE AND IN THE TO VIEW ON ON ON THAT ON THAT OUR FRONT LANGUAGE. HAPPY TO ABSOLUTE OKAY. OKAY -- BUT THE QUESTIONS CONCERNS. FIVE OKAY SO IT'S REMOVED BY A CINEMA CASKEY -- IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE BY THEIR AUTHORS. JUST ASK FOR DRIVER THING. THANK YOU ARE ABLE TO DOES A CLOSE -- DETECTIVE IS KALRA. ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN A. B. SEVEN NINETY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN HI ALAN HI BATES DALY [inaudible] HILL. SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE STERN. I CASKEY CASKEY I OKAY GREAT -- SO WILL HOLD OUT OPEN -- THREE ZERO WELL THAT OPEN FOR OTHER FOLKS THAT I THINK YOU SOME MEMBERS. WE SHOULD THE COMMITTEE WILL BE RELIEVED TO HEAR THIS IS MY VERY LAST BILL. I LOVE THE I LOVE THE COMMITTEE AS WELL BUT I'M SURE YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO SEE ME. GO AND HAVE SOME OTHER AUTHORS AS WELL. THANK YOU. AB ARE TEN FORTY SIX REVIVES AN ISSUE THAT I WORKED ON A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WHICH IS LOKING AT HOW WE WAS REDESIGNED THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM. THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE% PROGRAMS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS WE'VE HAD TO INCENTIVIZE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO GET INTO CLEAN CARS IT'S BEEN. A WHILE THE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED OR OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CLEAN CARS ON THE ROAD TODAY -- YET WE ARE STILL VERY FAR AWAY FROM OUR ONE POINT FIVE MILLION GOAL IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN OUR FIVE MILLION CAR GOAL IN. TWENTY THIRTY SO WE THINK BY HAVING A REDESIGN OF THE PROGRAM MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT TAKES OUT SOME OF THE YEAR TO YEAR VOLATILITY WITH THIS PROGRAM WE ARE VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE EVEN WITH THE KERN APPROPRIATION WE JUST DID IN THE BUDGET. THE PROGRAM POTENTIALLY COULD EVEN RUN OUT SOMETIME IN THE FALL THIS YEAR -- WHICH WOULD LEAVE CONSUMERS OUT IN A LURCH AND WOULD REALLY -- TAKE -- BE TAKE A HIT FOR OUR CLEAN CAR INDUSTRY AS AS EVERYBODY AND THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS 40% OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS. ARE CREATION IS COMING FROM TRANSPORTATION 80% OF THAT TRANSPORTATION NUMBER COMES FROM LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES WHICH INCLUDES PASSENGER VEHICLE SOME MOST OF THAT. POLLUTION IS REALLY COMING FROM THE CARS THAT YOU AND I DRIVE EVERY SINGLE DOWN THE ROAD. SO WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK BY VOTE ON A. B. TEN FORTY SIX WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ASK THE A. R. B. IN COORDINATION WITH PERMANENT FINANCING THE STATE TREASURER. TO LOOK AT DESIGNING THE A PROGRAM WHERE THEY COULD SECURITIZED FUNDS IN THE SHORT TERM. TO GIVE OUT OVER -- SAY A TEN YEAR PERIOD POTENTIALLY RAISE THE REBATE LEVEL UP TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT HAVE THAT REBATE GO TO ZERO OVER TIME SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID WITH -- GO SOLAR AND SEVERAL WE THINK BY REDESIGN THE PROGRAM IN THIS FASHION WE CAN GET TO OUR FIVE MILLION VEHICLE GOAL BY. TWENTY THIRTY WITHOUT RESPECT FAST RIGHT [inaudible] YES SIR. SURE MEMBERS -- DAN CHAU WITH TESLA. AS THE ONLY -- OUT OF AUTO MANUFACTURER IN THE STATE AND THE STATE'S LARGEST MANUFACTURING EMPLOYER I'M PLEASED -- HERE TO REPRESENT THE TUSSLE IN SUPPORT OF AB. TEN FORTY SIX IN SHORT WE BELIEVE -- THE BILL IS NEEDED TO FORCE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO REFORM THE CVR P.. TO HELP MEET THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION AND GHG AND THEIR POLLUTION GOALS. AT A TIME WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO ROLL BACK FUEL ECONOMY AND GHG EMISSIONS STANDARDS. THE STATE NEEDS TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO BUY EDIE'S. AND MAINTAIN THE EEVEE SALES MOMENTUM THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THUS FAR -- AS OF MAY WITH -- BUT A 6% MARKET SHARE -- LAST YEAR -- ALMOST 10% -- WITH A COUPLE MONTHS. AS THE THE SOME MEMBER A MENTIONED -- WE BOTH BRING TO THIS CONVERSATION TO THE BEST PRACTICES OF THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE WHICH REPRESENTS THE GOLD STANDARD IN REBATE DESIGN. STABLING CONTINUOUS -- REVENUE SOURCE TRANSPARENT REBATE LEVELS THAT STEP DOWN OVER TIME AS PENETRATION INCREASED. CONSUMER EDUCATION AND AWARENESS WHILE ALSO GIVING TAXPAYERS AND DECISION MAKERS CERTAINTY THAT REBATES WOULD COME TO AN END. AB TEN FORTY SIX IS INFORMED BY THIS EXPERIENCE AND IS BEFORE YOU AT A TIME WHEN UNFORTUNATELY THE PROGRAM -- THIS IS RUN OUT OF FUNDING -- AND CONSUMERS HAVE AGAIN BEEN PLACED ON WAIT LISTS -- SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU -- SOMEONE ROOTING FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP RESPECT THAT FIRST PRIVATE.

MORNING MR SHARON MEMBERS LEE IS OVER THERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. CAL CHAMBER AND A COALITION OF BUSINESSES AND CLEAN TECH ORGANIZATIONS ARE UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DOES THE DUPLICATE EXISTING STUDIES ONGOING A CARBON INTERFERES WITH TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. CAL CHAMBER ONLY OPPOSE CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE BILL WHICH SOUGHT TO STUDY WAYS TO INCREASE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPORTANT ISSUE TO EVALUATE. CUSTOMERS NOT OPPOSED TO HOLISTIC STUDY TO EVALUATE WAYS TO INCREASE PENETRATION OF LOW OR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR DID JUST TO PROVE A ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR EXPENDITURE FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS MONEY. FOR CARD TO STUDY THIS VERY ISSUE INCLUDING WAYS TO TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION ECONOMY INCLUDING INCREASING THE USE OF LOW AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN THE STATE. THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY CIRCUMVENT THAT PROCESS AND HAMSTRINGS A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH BY MANDATING THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE BE SCALED WITH THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATION TO MEET A FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. THE REALITY IS IS POINTED OUT BY THIS COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THAT DESPITE THE USE OF REBATES MARKET PENETRATION OF YOUR MICHELIN VEHICLES REMAINS AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET EDUCATION AND OTHER FACTORS MUST BE ADDRESSED FIRST. IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RECENTLY POINTED OUT THAT THESE EXPRESSIONS EXPENDITURES HAVE NOT TO DATE BEEN EFFECTIVE OR COST COMPETITIVE WHICH DOES NOT HELP US MEET OUR STATE'S EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. ANOTHER TRANSPORTATION SECTORS MUST ALSO BE ADDRESSED WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE IN THE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON OUR CONCERNS. ABOUT FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS CAL CHAMBER MEANS A POSTED AB. TEN FORTY SIX GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOURNALS.

ON THE OTHER ISSUE WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE AUTHOR YESTERDAY AND RAISE THE ISSUE OF FEE BATES AND ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT THAT SORT OF PROGRAM AND STRUCTURE AND HOW WE'VE SEEN THOSE THOSE SYSTEMS FAIL IN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHEN THEY'VE TRIED THEM -- THE THE AUTHOR AND I CERTAINLY DON'T SPEAK FOR HIM BUT MADE CLEAR TO US IN THE MEETING THAT THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT HE EXPLAINED TO US. MUCH OF WHAT HE SAID IN COMMITTEE HERE TODAY ABOUT SORT OF FRONT LOADING -- USING A SECURITIZATION TOOL TO FRONT LOAD MONEY FOR C. B. R. P. AND I THINK OUR RESPONSE WAS WELL THAT'S SOMETHING WE'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. AND SO -- AS A SAID WE WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IT IS IN PRINT -- BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH A A LONGER TERM MORE STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR C. B. R. P. WE THINK -- THE CONCEPT IS SOMETHING WE CAN WORK WITH BUT LOT MORE MEAT NEEDS TO BE PUT ON THE PHONE A LOT MORE DETAIL. IN THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT DISCUSSION OKAY PURSUE THAT IN MANY OTHERS YOU WHAT WHAT IS IS THERE IT WAS THE RECYCLE CONTENT. OF THE CARPET IN THE ZAPS. YOU KNOW I I MEAN I'LL BE HONEST -- I YOU YOU KNOW UNDER THE HOOD OF A CAR IS RECYCLED CARPET A LOT OF THOSE PLASTICS ARE MADE FROM RECYCLED CARPET. ITSELF.

WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT -- NOT HAVING A CAP ON THE ON THE FEES AND RUN AWAY -- OPPORTUNITY COSTS THAT THE THE MONEY MIGHT GO -- TO TOWARDS CLEAN AIR AND IMMEDIATE REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND KNOCKS RATHER THAN ASPIRATIONAL GOALS IN TWENTY THIRTY SO FOR THOSE REASONS LOOK FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN TRYING TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU.

I WE WANT TO THANK MR TING AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO PROMOTE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WHERE THE RETAILERS. TRYING TO GET PEOPLE IN THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY. THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS RELATED TO FEE BATES AND IT'S VERY BROAD AUTHORITY THAT IS GIVEN TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO POTENTIALLY CREATE A PROGRAM. A FEW BATES MEAN GET INTO IT IF YOU'D LIKE OF WHY IT JUST DOESN'T WORK NOW -- DOES NOT WORK IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WE THINK IT WILL NOT HAPPEN WE BELIEVE WE'VE REACHED A COMMITMENT TO TAKE LANGUAGE TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS -- AND WITH THAT THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY BUT A TWEENER WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT LANGUAGE IN PRINT AND WE TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN WORK ON GETTING THE SUPPORT POSITION FOR THE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ERIN RODRIGUEZ WITH UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS ALSO TWEENER IS ON THE BILL AND WE APPRECIATE. THE WORK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING AND HIS STAFF IS DONE TO SUPPORT AND BOLSTER THE STATE WIDE DEPLOYMENT OF STE -- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES -- WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF IMPORTANT DETAILS TO BE WORKED OUT INCLUDING AND LANGUAGE ON EQUITY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THANKS. GOOD MORNING CATHERINE GARCIA ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA ALSO A TWEETER AB TWO TEN FORTY SIX HAS POTENTIAL TO IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE. SOME OF THE KEY STICKING POINTS THAT PREVENT THE EEVEE INCENTIVES ARE BEING AS EFFECTIVE AS NEEDED I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THANK YOU. CRIME. ARE THE MATTERS NOW BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS. ALL BY CENTER SKINNER. SO I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE SECURITIZATION OF REVENUES WE GOT TO TREASURER AIRPORT AND FINANCE. FIND THESE INSTRUMENTS SECURITIZED THEM AND CREATE. A BUNCH OF MONEY A BUNCH OF MONEY THEN THE AIRPORT'S GONNA SET. NO HIGHER THAN SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SORT OF A REBATE SCHEDULE AND THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER AXIS AND THIS IS GOING TO SAY IN ORDER TO GET TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE OR WE THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED THIS REBATE. AT THAT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED LET ALL THE CONSUMERS SO AS THE STAFF REPORT PART PARTS THAT DO A BETTER JOB A DAD. INTO WILL SOME OTHER TRIGGER. OCCURS THAT WE READ WE PASS MILLION TO WHATEVER IT IS AND THEN THAT REBATE WOULD BE ADJUSTED. UNTIL LATE SOME POINT IN TWENTY THIRTY WERE IT. ONE ZERO THE JUSTICE ZERO IS THAT IS THAT THAT THAT THE ONLY IDEA ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. GOOD AND THEY AN IDEA THAT YOU NEED TO SECURITIZED AS WE SAY -- WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE ALSO JUST SAY HEY WE WANT TO TAKE ALL THIS MONEY OUT OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FROM BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY. WOULD REDUCE ALL THE OTHER PRIVATE SO WE THINK THIS IS A MORE RESPONSIBLE WAY TO GO -- IN THE IN AROUND SO THAT WE COULD GET THE MONEY UP FRONT BUT THEN PAY IT BACK OVER TIME SO. ANOTHER WAY TO LOOKING AND IS THERE IS A POP. AN AMOUNT THAT ALLOCATED FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUND THIS COULD BE AN AUGMENTATION. TWO TO ONE ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT OF REBATES AT SOMETIME IN APRIL OR SEPTEMBER WHEREVER WHEREVER HIS AND AND ALSO POSSIBLY. RESTORE BECAUSE AS THE FEDERAL LEVEL GOES DOWN THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT BACK FILLING IS AT THE THE THRILLS AND THAT'S WHAT THE MAJOR CONCERNS IN MY WE WANTED TO DO THIS. YES WITH TESLA AND GENERAL MOTORS THE TWO MOST POPULAR SELLERS OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA. THE BECAUSE OF THE THE VOLUME THAT THEY SOLD WHICH IS A GOOD. TO THE GOOD NEWS ON THAT THEY HAVE NOW GONE THE CUT IN THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT SO NOW IF YOU WANT TO GO BY TESLA OR CHEVY BOLT. YOU DON'T GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF TAX CREDIT IF YOU WANT TO GO BUY SOME OF THE CAR. AND THERE WAS SOME CRITICISM ABOUT THIS. BEING DUPLICATIVE OF THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WAS HAND MONDAYS BUDGET -- THAT IS TO CUT ITS STYLE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAT STUDY IS ABOUT A MUCH MORE HOLISTIC STUDY ON HOW YOU COULD TO CLEAN CARS BY. TWENTY FORTY WHICH INCLUDES CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE A WHOLE VARIETY OF FACTORS THIS IS VERY VERY NARAL. ONLY LOOKING AT THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM THANK YOU. AND I FORGOT TO LEAD OFF BY SAYING WE'RE REALLY HAPPY WITH THE COMMITMENTS AND HAPPY TO TAKE. OKAY -- I MEAN THE COURSE THE BIG QUESTION IS WHERE IS THE MONEY. IT'S GONNA WATER BOWL. THAT WATER UNDER THE WATER YEAH THAT IS ALWAYS THE BIG QUESTION IS WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM SO THAT THAT' WHY WE DIFFERENT P. GINNY THAT'S A THAT'S A POSSIBILITY OKAY NOT A BAD IDEA SENATE SKINNER -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WANT TO THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR FOCUSING ON MARKETS AND ECONOMIC SIGNALS BECAUSE I'M IN OUR CALIFORNIA SOME OF OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL. PROGRAMS THAT HAVE EITHER HELP DESK CLEAN NEAR. OR REDUCE WASTE OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THIS BAND BECAUSE WE GOT OUR MARKET SIGNALS RIGHT AND WE GOTTA GET OUR MARKET SIGNALS RIGHT ON THIS ONE BECAUSE TRANSPORTATION IS STILL TAILPIPE EMISSIONS. ARE THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF OUR EMISSIONS THAT CREATE THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHAOS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK IN I SEE MORE IMPORTANTLY NOT BECAUSE THE CLIMATE CRISIS ISN'T JUST VERY VERY REAL. BUT PEOPLE CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE DIRECTLY AFFECTED. MAYBE NOT. A DIFFERENT WAY BECAUSE FIRES ARE PRETTY BAD BUT YOU'VE GOT MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. GETTING CHRONIC ASTHMA. THAT IS FROM AIR POLLUTION WE STILL HAVE OUT OF THE TEN MOST POLLUTED CITIES IN THE US. CALIFORNIA'S GOT SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THEM. AND IT'S PRIMARILY TAIL PIPE POLLUTION SO UNTIL WE GET TO THE TYPE OF GOALS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY SET HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE AROUND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE CLEAN. VEHICLES WE'RE NOT GOING TO CLEAN OUR AIR AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND WHILE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FAR GREATER AMOUNT OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION FINDER GIGI ERA FIND TO BE. DIRECTED TOWARDS THIS HUGE SECTOR OF GHG EMISSIONS AND CONTINUALLY APPROPRIATED. I THINK YOUR APPROACH IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TYING IT TO A PARTICULAR FUND SOURCE SO THAT WE STILL HAVE THE ABILITY. TO ARGUE HERE IN THERE EVEN THOUGH I WILL STILL MAKE THE CASE FOR A HIGHER PERCENT OF G. G. R. F. CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO GET CLEAN VEHICLES BUT ANYWAY. BUT THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE GOT THE PRICE OF ROOFTOP SOLAR DOWN IN NOT JUST ROOFTOP SOLAR. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT LIKE ROOFTOP SOLAR BUT THE BRINGING OF THAT PRICE DOWN BROUGHT DOWN THE PRICE OF ALL SOLAR PEAVEY WHICH BROUGHT DOWN. THE KILOWATT HOUR RENEWABLE GENERATION PRICE WHICH IS MADE UP WHY WE CAN HAVE -- BUT THE AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE GENERATION NOW IN THE STATE WITHOUT THE HUGE PRICES. SO WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING. NOW. YOUR BILL DOES THAT IT'S ON THE RIGHT MODEL -- IT'S NOT BEFORE US TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE -- MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES IN THIS ALSO BECAUSE FROM AN AIR POLLUTION POINT OF VIEW THERE EVEN A MORE SIGNIFICANT. SO IF WE'RE THAT WE SHOULD INLUDE THAT BUT THAT'S OKAY RIGHT NOW THIS IS AROUND THE PASSENGER VEHICLES -- SOME POINT WILL EXPAND IT. I BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I ALSO. DO HOPE THAT -- AND I KNOW YOU ARE WORKING WITH THEM THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH ART DEALERS CAR DEALERS AND OUR MAN YOU ARE AUTO MANUFACTURERS. THAT JUST LIKE THE PREVIOUS BILL THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT SWEET SPOTS SO THIS REALLY DOES. ACHIEVE WHAT WE HAVE IN MIND THE MARKET SIGNAL THAT YOU'RE DESIGNING HERE REALLY DOES HE KEEP IT AND WE DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THE SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO PRACTICE IT BEFORE WE'RE GOING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT BUT I APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE FOLKS WHO ARE EITHER IN OPPOSITION OR TWO WINNERS -- AND WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. RIGHT THIS QUESTIONS BUT THE MOVE -- TO FEW LIKE CLOSE TO JUST THREE QUICK POINT ON ON THE FEE BASED ISSUE ABSOLUTE THIS THIS BILL WAS NOT INTENDED TO USE FEE BAIT AS A FUNDING STREAM SO I ACTUALLY HAVE COMMITTED. TO DOWN -- TO SOME OF THE OPPONENTS IN TERMS OF EQUITY WE DEFINITELY WANT TO ADDRESS THE EQUITY PIECE SO WE ARE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS ACT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED MEETING HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES I THINK WE'RE VERY OPEN. TO INCLUSION IN THIS BILL IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT WITHOUT WITHOUT UPSETTING THE APPLE CART AND BITING OFF TOO MUCH. BY THE HAVE TO MUCH A WINDOW. BUT IF WE CAN'T THEN WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT -- WITHOUT RESPECT FASTER ABOUT. WHICH SO MUCH OKAY -- OBJECTIVE IS COR. ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN A. B. TEN SIXTY FOUR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. ALLEN. ALLEN HI BATES NO BATES NO DALI. DALI NO HILL. SKINNER [inaudible] I STERN. BY CASKEY MAKOWSKI I ARE YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THE ERA OF TING IS OVER -- WE WE WILL NOW MOVE. THE U. S. SENATE RAG OCCUR HE'S HERE TO PRESENT. ITEM FOR IN YOUR AGENDA. PACKETS MEMBERS IS AB. ONE SIXTY EIGHT YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB ONE SIX EIGHT AIMS TO ENSURE THAT THE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES AND SACRED SITES WILL BE PROTECTED UNDER NEW STREAMLINED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT LAW. WE ARE SEEKING TO PROVIDE A TEMPLATE THAT CAN BE USED IN FUTURE STREAMLINING LAWS AS WELL. WE HAVE LOST MUCH OF OUR STATES NATIVE HISTORY AND ONCE A RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL ARTIFACT SITE OR BURIAL GROUND IS LOST IT CANNOT BE REPLACED. AS A SHOW OF GOOD FAITH I ACCEPTED SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS YESTERDAY HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO THAT THESE AMENDMENTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA TRIBES. WE HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM THE SENATE HOUSING SURE THAT WE WILL WORK WITH TRIBAL ATTORNEYS LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND COMMITTEE STAFF UNTIL CALIFORNIA'S TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AGREED THAT WE HAVE A PRODUCT. THAT TRULY PROTECTS TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES. IF THAT EFFORT FAILS OVER THE INTERIM WE WILL STAND DOWN AND COME BACK NEXT YEAR WE'LL RETURN UNTIL WE HAVE A TRULY PROTECTED. CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS PLACES AND ARTIFACTS OF CALIFORNIA'S SOVEREIGN TRIBE IN TRIBAL NATIONS. TRIBES MUST HAVE ASSURANCES THAT ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS LANGUAGE AND THEY NEED A GUARANTEE THAT TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES WILL GET THE SAME PROTECTIONS. THAT THEY CURRENTLY RECEIVE UNDER AB. FIFTY TWO WITH CONSULTATION TRIBAL CULTURE RESOURCES CAN BE PROTECTED OR AVOIDED AND IMPACTS CAN BE MITIGATED. DEVELOPMENT CAN ACTUALLY MOVE FASTER WITH CONSULTATION BECAUSE LITIGATION IS LESS NECESSARY OF THE MEANS OF PROTECTION OF FOUR TRIBES. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOURSELVES PARTICIPATION IN THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I HOPE THEY'LL CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD. AS WE HAVE ENGAGE THE LARGER COMMUNITY OF TRIBAL STAKEHOLDERS I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT TOGETHER AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TRIBES WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. MEMBERS I S. REAR AYE AYE VOTE AND TODAY I HAVE WITH ME MICHELLE OPINION. OF FRONT REVERSING VARIOUS CALIFORNIA TRIBES. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE HI MY NAME'S MICHELLE APPENA I'M A MEMBER OF THE RIVER TRIBE FROM NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA. I'M AN ATTORNEY I REPRESENT MANY TRIBES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE BEEN PRACTICING FEDERAL INDIAN LAW FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA TRIBES -- A BIG PART OF MY PRACTICE. IN CULTURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION AND AND WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S OVER THE YEARS TO A MAN STATE LAW TO ENSURE THAT TRIBAL CULTURAL SITES ARE ARE ARE WELL PROTECTED. AND MANY OF OUR CULTURAL SITES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED -- OVER THE YEARS THROUGH -- CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE LAWS WERE NOT IN PLACE TO ALLOW FOR A CONSULTATION WITH TRIBES TO ENSURE THAT THE TRIBES COULD. IDENTIFY THOSE SITES -- AS I'M SURE SOME OF YOU KNOW. MOST OF OUR CULTURAL SITES ARE NOT WITHIN IN THE ARMENIAN RESERVATIONS BECAUSE WE WERE REMOVED FROM OUR HOMELANDS TO AND PLACED IN SMALL AREAS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY INCLUDE ALL OF OUR CULTURAL SITES ARE BURIALS -- AND TRADITIONAL CULTURAL PLACES. A SO STATE LAW IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PROTECT THESE PLACES -- FROM DEVELOPMENT AND FROM DESTRUCTION A LOT HAS BEEN LOST -- BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE STARTED OF MENDING A STATE LAW IN IN THE JOURNAL PLANNING CODE SO THAT WE COULD -- PROVIDED EARLY CONSULTATION FOR TRIBES TO BE AT THE TABLE WHEN COUNTIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR DETERMINING WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT CREATED THE FIRST DEFINITION OF CONSULTATION IN THE STATE. SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN ADDING IN IN AN IMPROVING TO THOSE TO THAT LAW THAT BODY OF LAW THAT'S THERE -- THERE'S A NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION HERE WITHIN THE STATE AND WE'VE BEEN IMPROVING THE STATUTES THAT GIVE IT AT THE READY TO ENSURE THAT THESE SITES ARE PROTECTED -- RECENTLY. IN THE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AB FIFTY TWO WAS PASSED. AND AB FIFTY TWO DOES PROVIDE A SEQUEL THE ON RAMP ESSENTIALLY WERE TRIBAL CULTURAL SITES OF THEIRS CONSULTATION IT IS REQUIRED WHEN THEY TRIED KNOWS THAT OTHER SITE THAT IT WOULD BE IN THE DEVELOPMENTS PASSED. AND WE ARE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CONSULTATION AND TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE MITIGATION MEASURE SO SB THIRTY FIVE WAS PASSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND ON THE HOUSING STREAMLINING ACT. UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE PRIOR LAWS AND THE PROCESS THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED OVER ALL OF THOSE YEARS. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THAT IT BRINGS IT INTO A HARMONY WITH. THE EXISTING CULTURE PRESERVATION LAWS AND WE HOPE THAT YOU CAN -- CONSIDERATE AND HELP US IMPROVE THAT PROCESS. OKAY -- FOLKS WANT TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. HELLO CHUCK APOLOGY ON BEHALF OF THE CHIANG AND COLUSA TRIBES -- ALONG WITH MICHELLE BY THEN WORKING ON SACRED SITES FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WITH THE TRIBES A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE. A LOT OF COMPROMISES WERE MADE AND OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO TAKE AWAY FROM A FROM AB -- FIFTY TWO I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH CALL GOING FORWARD TO GET THE RIGHT LANGUAGE AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. EFFORT WORKERS FOR THE DRY CREEK -- RICH REBOUND POMO INDIANS ALSO TO RIVER TRIBE EXPRESS THE THE SAME SENTIMENTS OF THE AUTHOR -- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS OF COURSE SO -- WE ALSO HAVE. SOME CONCERNS BUT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THIS VEHICLE MOVES FORWARD THANKS VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR YES NOTHING GONZALEZ ON BEHALF BEHALF OF BOYD GAMING AND SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY OF FOLKS WANNA RAISE OPPOSITION CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. CNN OKAY DRIVES BACK. BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. QUESTION STATUS IN A CASKET. FOR SOMEONE THANK THE AUTHOR ON THAT I YES I VOTED YES THEY AND HOUSING. I FEEL ANXIOUS. THIS TODAY ABOUT THE CONCEPT THE MINIMUM CONSULTATION AND AYE AYE -- I BELIEVE I HEARD IN THE AUTHOR'S PRESENTATION YOU SHARE THAT CONCERN BECAUSE THERE'S AN ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS MINISTERIAL APPROVAL OF INFILL HOUSING. AND A WE MADE A MISTAKE AND AND SB THIRTY FOUR BY NOT INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY CULTURAL. INDIAN -- FAXED OVER AREAS AND ALSO THERE'S DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THE SERVER DIFFICULT AREAS OR NOT WELL KNOWN AREAS THAT ARE THAT THE PUBLIC AND THE PUBLIC BECAUSE WE KNOW A WETLAND WE KNOW WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW WETLAND WE KNOW WHAT -- IN BAR MAINLY SENSITIVE AREA SO. WHEN? THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IS NOW PASSED THE CONSOLE WITH THE THE CALIFORNIA -- TRIBE AND THEN IT SAYS IT IN AN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE ACTIONS TO AVOID OR MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS AND THAT MAY BE. BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT PROCESS BECAUSE MINISTERIALIS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BRUCE IS THE SEQUEL PROCESS WHICH WILL SAY LET'S HAVE A HEARING ABOUT THIS AND LET'S TALK ABOUT CLARIFYING WITH WITH WHAT THAT IMPACT IS AND WHAT IT MAY BE. A TO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PROCESS AND I'M JUST CAUTION THE OUR ENTHUSIASM TO TO JUMP IN EVERY POSSIBLE INFILL SITE NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED AND I DIDN'T SUPPORT. SB THIRTY FIVE IN THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE SO I'M. I VOTED FOR AND I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR IT TODAY IN ON A MOVIE BUT I'M EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS -- CONCERNED ABOUT THESE INTO CS STICK. CITY ADMINISTRATOR. THANK ALL CONSULT WHAT YOU TRIBE HAD THE MEETING WE'RE MOVING FORWARD OR WILL GET THEIR THEIR IDEA OF MINIMIZING IS DIFFERENT THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A SEQUEL. OPEN. AND I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE AUTHORS. COMMENTS THEY MIGHT. JUST A SCAREDY CAT IN READING TOO MUCH INTO THEIR OR DO YOU SHARE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS -- I DO SHOW SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT I'M GOING TO HAVE MY WITNESS BECAUSE SHE WAS HERE WHEN THEY DID AB FIFTY TWO IN OTHERS AND THEY HAD COVER THAT DURING THE HOUSE OR DO YOU PREFER. TO TO YET THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN YOUR TOUCH ON ON MOVE THE BILL I HAVE TO STEP OUT FOR IN IT SO I JUST WANT TO MOVE THE BILL. ARE YOU TOUCHED UPON YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY THE THE NOT THEY WERE TRYING TO CRACK HERE BECAUSE THE THE SB THIRTY FIVE PROCESS DID DELINEATE CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FROM STREAMLINING. AND THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS BILL INCLUDED TRAVEL CUTS CULTURAL RESOURCES AS DEFINED IN -- THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE IN THE LIST OF EXCLUSIONS SO THAT IT WOULD NOT BE UNDER THE MINISTERIAL PROCESS -- THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT THAT BY THE SB THIRTY FIVES AUTHOR -- AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SORT THROUGH -- THE HOW THE MECHANICS OF THIS WILL WORK -- BECAUSE AB FIFTY TWO IS IN A SECRET PROCESS AND THAT IS NOT MINISTERIAL SO IT IS A DISCRETIONARY PROCESS THAT DOES TRIGGER YOU KNOW A LOT OF REMEDIES AND SO. WITH THE CULTURAL RESOURCE COMPONENT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS THE MECHANICAL PIECE THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH AND OF COURSE WE DO. WE MEANING THE TRIBES THAT THEN THE TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES THAT I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD CALL AN AB FIFTY TWO LIGHT. PROCESS THAT DOESN'T ADEQUATELY CONSIDER THE RESOURCE AT HAND -- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE AB FIFTY TWO PROTECTIONS ARE BUILT INTO THIS LEGISLATION. AND HOW THE WORDING OF THAT LOOKS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE WHEN AN MISTER CHAIR I THINK THE STAFF ANALYSIS IS SPOT ON ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE LACK OF LANGUAGE. IN THE IN THE SB THIRTY FIVE THE MINISTERIAL -- CONTEXT WHICH IS IT'S IT'S YOU GO INTO THIS CONSULTATION WITH THE JUST A BIG HOPE THAT -- THAT THE THE THE CITY MANAGER THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH IS IS GOING TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE THE THE CONCERNS THAT THE TRIBES SPRING WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE C. FOR PROCESS WHICH IS. FUNDAMENTALLY -- SPELLED OUT RIGHT AND WE YOU KNOW WE'VE SPENT MANY YEARS DEVELOPING V. SICKLE GUIDELINES AS THE HANDBOOK. THE P. R. OVER THE YEARS AB SO THERE'S A VERY WELL THE BOTTOM OF DEVELOPED BODY OF RULES REGULATIONS AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TRAINING -- DONE TO FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROVISIONS AND SO HAVING A ED MINISTERIAL PROCESS THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL OF THAT BUNDLE OF PROCESS. WOULD BE VERY CONFUSING AND I AM ONE OF MY MY CONCERNS IS THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE STREAMLINING BILLS THAT. THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY REPLICATED ANOTHER STREAMLINING BILLS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT DONE IN THIS SESSION BECAUSE WE WILL MISS TIME IN SITES COULD BE. IMPACTED IN THE INTERIM SO WE WOULD MEAN A WE DO FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET THIS DONE RIGHT. THIS SESSION. BEFORE THE END OF THE SESSION MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST ONCE AGAIN I I MENTIONED ALREADY BUT POINT OUT THAT MANY THE SACRED SITES. DON'T WANNA WELL PUBLICIZED THAT THEY EXIST THERE'S THERE'S JUST SAID A SENSITIVE I'M NOT SEEING THEIR TUCKED INTO THE COMMUNITY BUT THEY ARE TUCKED IN THE COMMUNITY AND THIS WHOLE -- MINISTERIAL PROCESSES ANTITHESIS THAT THAT THAT AT LEAST WHAT IT WHAT IS LEFT OF THAT HAS BEEN PRESERVED AND I I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION. AND THE AND THE AND THE AUTHOR TODAY. THANK YOU IF I COULD JUST ADD THIS ROUTE ONE WHAT REAL QUICK POINT THAT --YOU KNOW THIS IS A BILL THAT IS FOCUSED AND TARGETED I THINK TOWARDS URBAN SETTINGS -- BUT URBAN SETTINGS DO INCLUDE TRIBAL CULTURAL SITES -- I DRIVE BY THEM AND I TAKE MY DAUGHTER TO SCHOOL AT RIO AMERICANO HIGH SCHOOL OF THEIR LANDS THAT ARE SET ASIDE. THEIR SHELL MOUNDS IN THE BAY AREA THERE YOU HAVE BEEN BUILT AROUND AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'VE BEEN PROTECTED THEY'VE BEEN CAP THEY MAY BE A PARKING LOT. ABOUT THEIR THEIR IN THEIR UNDERNEATH THAT AND SO THIS BILL -- SB THIRTY FIVE COULD POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW RESULT IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THOSE REMAINING SITES THAT HAVE BEEN SORT OF HELD AND PROTECTED ALL THIS TIME. BUT IT ALSO IS A BILL OBVIOUSLY THE PLACE ACROSS THE STATE SO IT WILL APPLY IN RURAL AREAS AS WELL AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I'M CONCERNED WITH IS THAT THE THE CAR AREA. FOR THE CAMPFIRE -- YOU KNOW THE CITY A PARADISE BURNED DOWN AND ALL THESE OTHER AREAS -- YOU KNOW WE'RE OBLITERATED AND TRAVEL CULTURAL SITES HAVE BEEN EXPOSED IN SO TRIBES HAVE BEEN IN THERE IDENTIFYING THOSE SITES AND WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE THEY WERE COVERED WITH DEVELOPMENT. BUT NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THEIR THEIR YOU KNOW HOW THEY COULD BE AFFECTED BY -- YOU KNOW STREAMLINED PROJECTS TICKET HOUSING UP AND IT'S NOT THAT WE OPPOSE LOW INCOME HOUSING BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES ALSO A LIVE THERE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THEY NEED LOW INCOME HOUSING. BUT WE JUST WANT TO BALANCE THE INTERESTS HERE AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SITES THAT WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE BUILT -- THAT WE AVOID THEM. AND IF WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT WE CAN AVOID HIM AND PUT HIM SOME PLACE BETTER YEAH. YEAH MY GRAMMY BECAUSE THE VERY THOUGHTFUL CORRECTIVE -- WITH REGISTRY THIRTY FIVE TIMES HAPPENED SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU -- OTHER THOUGHTS ARE QUESTIONS LIKE IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER SKINNER -- MY WILL TO CLOSE US OF THE S. THREE I WROTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE KEEP THE SERVICE CORPS. ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASSED THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE. ALLEN HI ALLEN HI BATES. BATES HI DOLLY. DOLLY AYE HILL [inaudible] SKINNER [inaudible] STERN. BY CASKEY CASKEY I'VE OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY I WILL ANSWER FROM SOBRE COOLEY WHO'S HERE TO PRESENT AB THREE NINETY SIX THIS IS ITEM FIVE IN YOUR PACKETS GOOD MORNING -- MR MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY PERCENT AB. TWO NINETY SIX AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS WHICH I AM TAKING. AN OBJECT WE WANT TO SAY. I THINK THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT NOTABLE BILL. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR CONSULTANT HAS DONE ON HY TAKE A GOOD IDEA AND KIND OF IMPROVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE YOU THE RIVER BEACH ROAD YOU HAVE TO HAVE IDEAS THAT WORK SO I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. AND ONE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WORK BY YOUR STAFF -- AB TWO NINE SIX ESTABLISHES THE CLAIM INNOVATION GRANT PROGRAM WITHIN THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. TO ACCELERATE AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT NEW INNOVATIONS. IMPROVE ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCE TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- RECORDED RECENT YOU AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE THE I. P. P. C. STUDIES SURF REPORT. AS WELL AS A NATIONAL CLAMOR ASSISTANT ASSESSMENT. IMPACTS OF GLOBALWARMING OF COURSE ARE ALREADY BEING RESERVE ACROSS THE NATION THE WORLD. IN THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW. IN OUR MOST RECENT SESSION OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLICIES THE LA -- SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED AT THIS STATE SUPPORT INNOVATION. AND ADDRESS OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. THAT. THE BILL INTENDS TO ROCKET UP TO BOOST THE BEST IDEAS THAT CAN HELP ADDRESSED CARBON. DOES ALREADY BEEN RELEASED. AND ADDRESSED ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION IN THE AIR WATER AND SOIL. THIS BILL WOULD UTILIZE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS TO AWARD MATCHING GRANT FUNDS. FOR INNOVATIONS IMPROVE ADAPTABILITY RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE PROGRAM WE FUNDED TO A DIFFERENT ECONOMIC TOOL THAN MOST THE STATE'S OTHER CLIMATE POLICIES. AND THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT BECOMES A FUNDING SOURCE [inaudible] OF THAT IS A NEW ONE IN THE MIX AND DOESN'T PULL FOR EXISTING DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE. THE ELECTRIC PROGRAM INVESTMENT CHARGE OR EPIC FUND OR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. AND I HAVE WITH PRIMEROS SELECT THE RIBS IN THE LARK TO INSTITUTE HERE IN SUPPORT SO MERRY. HELLO THERE. MY NAME'S MERRY SO LUCKY I JOIN YOU TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR TO INSTITUTE IN SUPPORT OF AB T.. NINETY SIX LARA IS A LOS ANGELES BASED NGO THAT TRANSFORMS IDEAS AND RESEARCH INTO MARKET READY PRODUCTS. ARTIST SUPPORTIVE OF AB TWO NINETY SIX BECAUSE ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE SEE THE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC DOLLARS INVESTED IN RESEARCH YIELDS POSITIVE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. WE RECOGNIZE THE BILL AUTHORS INTENTIONS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BY ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR CLIMATE RELATED RESEARCH. WE ARE PARTICULARLY EXCITED TO BE WORKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICES ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRIDGE THE GAP. FROM RESEARCH TO MARKET READY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CLIMATE INNOVATION GRANT PROGRAM WOULD NOT ONLY ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS BUT WILL BRING POSITIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO THE STATE. TO FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS THE PARALLEL LARGE HIS CORE MISSION. THIS GRANT PROGRAM UTILIZES THE SUCCESSFUL MODEL THAT WE SEE ELSEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS LEVERAGING MATCHING FUNDS AND THUS COMBINING MANY FUNDING SOURCES FOR APPLIED RESEARCH. WITH THE HELP OF FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS AN ACCELERATOR SUCH AS LARGER COMPANIES LIKE MANGO MATERIALS CAN TURN THE RESEARCH INTO pMARKET READY PRODUCTS.

THAT MAY LEAD TO SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH SORT OF THIS EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I THINK TO FIND A WAY HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. IN OUR DEMOCRACY. TO START A BE LOOKING FOR A GROWING AGE FOR GOOD IDEAS THAT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR ON THIS PROBLEM. IS TREMENDOUS. AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT LETS US DEVELOP. ADDITIONAL GROWING AGES FOR RESEARCH THE COMPLETE KEY ROLE AND TRY. I'M DELIGHTED TO HAVE MR STERN IS MICHAEL WATER HE'S BEEN A GREAT CHAMPION WITH ME. HI HE HE IS PRESENT AND IN SPIRIT HERE RIGHT NOW. QUESTION I BILL. OKAY I CENTER PLEASE CALL.

STERN MIKE OWSKI CASKEY I OKAY. THAT'S FOUR ZERO WILL LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR OTHER FOLKS DOWN THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALRIGHT WE'LL NEXT CALL OF US IN THE QUIRK. WHO'S YOUR PRESENT AB. FOUR OH TWO THIS ITEM SIX IN YOUR AGENDAS. HAVING BEEN HERE SINCE EIGHT THIRTY I NOW HAVE RENEWED RESPECT. FOR THE LOBBYISTS WHO HAVE TO BE HERE NEVER KNOWING WHEN THEIR BILL WILL COME UP. FOR HOURS ON END. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU CHAIR ALAN AND SENATORS. IT'S GREAT TO HEAR SEE MY FORMER SAMPLING COLLEAGUE NOW MY SENATE COLLEAGUE MISTER DALI HERE. HE WAS -- COURSE VICE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE WHEN I STARTED TO CHERISH AND ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU. SO AB FORO TWO WOULD SAVE MONEY FOR WATER AGENCIES BY REDUCING THE COST OF OVERSIGHT. AND WOULD KEEP REGULATORY OVERSIGHT LOCAL SO THAT'S THE MAIN POINT I'M GONNA REPEAT IT. AB FOUR OH TWO WOULD SAVE MONEY FOR ALL WATER AGENCIES BY REDUCING THE COST OF OVERSIGHT. AND WOULD KEEP REGULATORY OVERSIGHT LOCAL. AB FORO TO AUTHORIZES THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ESTABLISH A FUNDING PROGRAM TO SUPPORT. LOCAL LONGER OVERSIGHT OF SMALL DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS LOCAL HEALTH OF FISH OFFICERS. REGULATE SMALL DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND THIRTY CALLIN. COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. REGULATION OF DRINKING WATER IS FUNDED ENTIRELY BY FEES CHARGED TO PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. BECAUSE FEES VARY BASED ON SYSTEM SMALLER SIZE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS DO NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT FEE REVENUE. TO COVER THE COST OF OVERSIGHT. AS A RESULT SIX COUNTY SHOULD RETURN DRINKING WATER OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY BACK TO THE STATE WATER BOARD. THE FEES FOR THIS OVERSIGHT ARE THEN ASSESSED ON WATER SYSTEM STATE WHY. SO THE OVERSIGHT. THAT THE WATER BOARD DOES IS ALREADY PAID FOR BY ALL THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. SMALL WATER SYSTEMS NEED THE MOST OVERSIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY. TO VIOLATE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO FEW RESOURCES. 90% OF ALL NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS ARE SMALL SYSTEMS. AB FOR OH TWO MAINTAINS LOCAL OVERSIGHT OF THESE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. AND USES THE ALREADY EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND NETWORK OF LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS. WITHOUT AB -- FOR TO SEVERAL COUNTIES WILL RETURN OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY BACK TO THE STATE WATER BOARD WHICH RESULT IN LESS LOCAL CONTROL AND HIGHER COSTS FOR THE STATE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE ARE -- JUST IN MILAN WHO IS SPONSORED -- WHO IS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION? OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS AND DANIELLE HOLMAN FROM PLASTER COUNTY PROCEED [inaudible] MADAM CHAIR. JUST ALONG WITH THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HEALTH DIRECTORS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU'LL START FROM THIS BILL -- AS THE OLDEST SAID WE REPRESENT THIRTY OF THE JURISDICTIONS THAT PROVIDE THIS CRITICAL OF THE SITE. AND I JUST WANT TO STRESS THIS IS AN OPT IN PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT A NEW FEE AUTHORITY. THE FUNDING IS ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE THAT COMES FROM AS YOU'VE HAD PLENTY DISCUSSION ABOUT SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER WHERE WE GET THE FUNDING OF THE STATE BOARD GETS THE FUNDING IS AN ISSUE FOR ANOTHER DAY. WE WANT TO ESTABLISH THIS POLICY IN THE POLICY IS THAT. THE STATE AND ITS FUNDING MECHANISMS WHATEVER THAT IS SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO RETAIN THIS AUTHORITY. BECAUSE THIS AUTHORITY HELPS THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS STAY CONNECTED PARTICULARLY IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY OF THESE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS UNDER STRESS. SO WE ARE LOSING WE'VE LOST FIVE WE OFF PLACE TO LOSE ANOTHER HALF A DOZEN OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THEY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP THIS PROGRAM GOING. AND WE BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH BEFORE THE STATE WATER BOARD WE WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THERE WAS A SIMILAR BILL INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND NOW IT'S BECOMING A PRESSING MATTERS SO. WONDER THANK AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS IT'S A KIND OF A GEEKY ISSUE IT'S A DIFFICULT ISUE. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING IT OUT IN THE TABLE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE WATER AGENCIES TO FIGURE OUT THE FUNDING SOURCE BUT WITH URGELL COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT US TO RETAIN WHERE THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHICH THIS IS AN OPT IN. WHERE THEY WISH TO RETAIN THE PROGRAM WE BELIEVE THIS IS GOOD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH? GOOD GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY AND IT'S GOING TO HELP BALANCE THE INEQUITY WITH THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND DANIEL CAN EXPLAIN BETTER WHY THIS IS CRITICAL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO KEEP THE PROGRAM. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU JUSTIN ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS DANIELLE PULLMAN AND I'M A REGISTERED ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST WITH PLASTER COUNTY. AND FORCING THE STATE REGULATIONS FOR SMALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS -- I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF DIRECTORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IN SUPPORT OF AB -- FOUR OH TO A I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THIS PROGRAM REMAINS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OVER THE LAST DECADE DRINKING WATER REGULATIONS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY STRINGENT FOR EXAMPLE ADDITIONAL LEADING COPPER TESTING AND ALL OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOLLOWING THE DEVASTATING EVENTS IN FLINT MICHIGAN. SMALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN OPERATED BY A SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IT COULD BE A SMALL COMMUNITY THAT'S MUTUALLY OWNED WHERE IT'S JUST A GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE. ARE MAINTAINING THE WATER SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANY CASES THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY DON'T HAVE ENGINEERING BACKGROUNDS -- PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH UTILITIES THEY SIMPLY JUST DO NOT HAVE THE TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL CAPACITY OF LARGER WATER SUPPLIERS AND THEREFORE. THE REALLY RELY ON THE LOCAL COUNTY REGULATORS FOR THAT FACE TO FACE TIME IN GETTING OUR BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND GOING TO THESE WATER SYSTEMS AND PROVIDING THEM. ASSISTANCE IN ENSURING THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER. IF THIS PROGRAM REVERTS BACK TO THE STATE THE STATE REGULATORS OFFICE COULD BE FOUR TO FIVE HOURS AWAY AND THEY JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SAME TYPE OF ASSISTANCE THAT THE COUNTIES CAN. COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE WE TRULY KNOW THE INS AND OUTS OF OUR COUNTIES WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE BUILDING OF PLANNING DEPARTMENTS AND UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT IN OUR COUNTIES. WE ALSO MAINTAIN GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LARGE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIERS AND THEREFORE WE ARE THAT PERFECT MIDDLE MAN. IN DODD COORDINATING ASSISTANCE BETWEEN THE LARGE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIER AND THAT SMALL WORLD WATER SYSTEMS WE CAN ALSO COORDINATE AND WE DO COORDINATE A CONSOLIDATION OF THESE SMALL UTILITIES WHEN IT'S POSSIBLE. ON ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IS THAT COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE DURING EMERGENCIES AND EVENTS LIKE WILD FIRES AND FLOODS WHERE. OUR ON A SMALL WORLD WATER SYSTEMS CAN BECOME COMPROMISED I'M JUST QUESTIONING WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE NEXT DEVASTATING WILDFIRE STRIKES CALIFORNIA. AND THE INSPECTOR FOR THE RURAL COMMUNITY IS FOUR TO FIVE HOURS AWAY AND THEIR FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON CITY OF SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES AND THESE LARGE WATER SUPPLIERS. THEREFORE I AM IN SUPPORT AND I FEEL THAT THIS PROGRAM. CAN AND SHOULD REMAIN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW FOLKS ONE ADAM SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS MY NAME IS MERION WARMER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTIES WITH THE CHAIRS INDULGENCE I'D LIKE TO MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS. ONE OF MOST OF OUR COUNTIES ARE NOT WE ARE RELUCTANT TO INVITE THE STATE IN. TO HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR SYSTEMS BUT THIS IS A FRAMEWORK THAT'S EXISTING AND ALLOWS FOR OPTING IN AS JUSTIN MENTIONED AND WE THINK IT'S AN IT'S AN OPTION THAT THE COUNTIES. SHOULD BE ABLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF SECONDLY MOST OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE IN OUR COUNTIES AND ARE DISADVANTAGED AND THIS AGAIN WILL GIVE US AN OPTION THAT WILL HELP US PROVIDE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. CARE MARTIN ST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT. CAN'T DO BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ANDREW EVAN TURNER WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT. MEGAN FLOYD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF DIRECTORS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ALSO THE LOCAL REGULATOR IN SUPPORT OF AB FOR A TWO THANK YOU. OKAY FOLKS WINERIES OPPOSITION CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. PLEASE STAY HERE. CAN YOU SPELL [inaudible] YEAH. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN COMMITTEE STAFF FOR TAKING THE TIME AND ATTENTION. FOR THE TIME AND ATTENTION THAT THEY'VE GIVEN TO THIS BILL ADDITIONALLY I LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR HIS STAFF AND THE SPONSOR FOR CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US TO TRY TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT WOULD SATISFY EVERYBODY INVOLVED. LP'S DO IMPORTANT WORK. AN AQUA KNOWS AT SOME COUNTIES CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE THE FEE BASED TO COVER THE REGULATORY COSTS THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND DON'T OPPOSE THE CREATION A NEW REGULATORY PROGRAM. RATHER AQUA IN THE MORE THAN SIXTY ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED TO THIS BILL ARE POSED TO THE POSSIBLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS PROGRAM. THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK FUNDING FROM THE BUDGET IN FACT THE BILL IS SILENT ON A FUNDING SOURCE HOWEVER SINCE THE PROGRAM TO BE PLACED IN A SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT. THE STATE WATER BOARD CAN FIND THIS PROGRAM USING FUNDS FROM THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACCOUNT WHICH IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF DRINKING WATER FEES. PAID BY ALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. AQUA OBJECTS TO THIS FUNDING SOURCE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST MANY OF THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PUBLICWATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE REPRESENTS ALREADY PAY DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE IN DRINKING WATER FEES THAN SMALLER WATER SYSTEMS. SO IF THE STATE WATER BOARD INCREASING INCREASES RATES WITHOUT BRIEF PROVIDING RECIPROCAL BENEFIT IT BECOMES HARDER FOR OUR MEMBERS TO MEET THEIR MISSION OF PROVIDING SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. SECOND THIS PROGRAM WOULD COST THE STATE WATER BOARD ROUGHLY FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IF EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE DECIDED TO PARTICIPATE. LAST FISCAL YEAR THE WATER BOARD COLLECTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND DRINKING WATER FEES. THIS MEANS THE WATER BOARD COULD BE REQUIRED TO COLLECTS 5260% AND ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO ADEQUATELY FUND THIS PROGRAM. AKA QUESTIONS HOW THE WATER BOARD COULD ACTUALLY FROM THIS PROGRAM AND REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX AN ARTICLE THIRTEEN A THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THESE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATES THE MAN THAT REGULATORY FEES IMPOSED ON A LOCAL AGENCY DO NOT EXCEED THE RESULT IN PROPORTIONAL COST OF THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE STATE. OUR MEMBERS ARE NOT REGULATED BY L. P. A.'S THAT MEANS THE WATER BOARD COULD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE RATES ON PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS WITHOUT RE PROVIDING ANY ADDITIONAL SERVICE. ESSENTIALLY REQUIRING ONE PUBLIC ENTITY TO SUBSIDIZE ANOTHER. WE'VE REQUESTED THAT THE AUTHOR MAKE THIS A TO YOUR BILL AND GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS TO IDENTIFY A FUNDING SOURCE UNFORTUNATELY PROPONENTS HAVE REJECTED THIS REQUEST THEREFORE UNTIL THE PROPONENTS IDENTIFYING ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- GOOD MORNING PRECIADO YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF TIME I'M RYAN THAT JACKIE WITH THE REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY. RW A IS A JOINT POWERS ASSOCIATION COMPRISED OF TWENTY pTHAT PROVIDE DRINKING WATER TO TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA. I PREFERRED TO BE HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE GOOD WORK THAT WE DO WHICH IS OUR MISSION IS TO RELIABLY PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE WATER -- TO ACHIEVE THAT MISSION OUR PER TOP PRIORITIES ARE TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. BOB. ADDRESS WATER EFFICIENCY AND TO MEET THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATER IN OUR SERVICE AREA. OFTEN TIMES THIS MEANS THAT WE'RE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH THE HELP HE IS. ONE OF OUR MEMBER AGENCIES PLASTER COUNTY WATER AGENCY JUST HEARD FROM DANIELLE ODD PLASTER COUNTY WATER AGENCY AND DANIELLE HAVE A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP. DANIELLE MENTIONED THAT -- THEY'VE COLLABORATED ON SEVERAL CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES -- AND I DON'T MEAN TO STEAL DANIELLE'S FUNDER BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AN AWARD WINNING PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION TO ALL THE SMALL DRINKING WATER SUPPLIERS AROUND THE STATE. TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT SHE MENTIONED THAT'S AN ANNUAL PROGRAM HOSTED IN THE SUMMER AND SQUAW VALLEY SO FOR ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS ALL OF YOUR SMALL WATER SUPPLIERS YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD LOOK THEM UP BECAUSE IT'S A VERY VALUABLE SERVICE. REALLY APPRECIATE THAT COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP OUR CHALLENGE WITH THE BILL IS THE SHIFT IN IN FUNDING -- THAT THE FUNDING COMES OUT OF ESSENTIALLY EYES WHICH IMPEDES OUR ABILITY TO DO ARE GOOD WORK. WHAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS A SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS FOR L. P. A.'S TO DO THEIR GOOD WORK AND FOR US TO DO OUR COULD WORK WE THINK THAT THAT SOLUTION IS? IS AVAILABLE OUT THERE IF WE LOOK AT OTHER SOURCES OF OF FUNDING AS CHRIS MENTIONED THE BIG CHALLENGE IS. THIS IS GONNA COME OUT OF DRINKING WATER FEE IS. THE IT'S AS JUSTIN MENTIONED IT'S A BIT WONKY. AND THAT IS A BIT WONKY BUT IT CREATES AN EXTREME COST PRESSURE OUT OF THE EXISTING -- REVENUES THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND DRINKING WATER FEES AND SO WITH THAT. I FAILED TO MENTION THAT IS WITH -- REGRET THAT I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE WE DO SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE WORK THIS ONLY AMERICORPS DOES AND AGAIN THE WORK THAT LP IS TO THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH. ABOUT THE FUNDING. BUT NO BUDGET HAD WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS WE ARE CONCERNED THAT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. THIS WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FEE INCREASES ON OUR SYSTEMS. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENT TO THE SPONSOR AND AUTHOR HAVE COMMITTED TO REALLY MAKE PROGRESS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TRYING TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. WE WILL BE TAKING THIS BILL BACK TO OUR LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE NEXT WEEK FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON WAYS THAT WE CAN FIND RESURCES. APART FROM THE INCREASED FEES TO SUPPORT THE IMPORTANT WORK OF LOCAL PRIVACY AGENCIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BOB READ WITH READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF DESERT WATER AGENCY IN ELDORADO IRRIGATION DISTRICT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. FIRST DIVERSE FOR THE LOS VIRGINIS MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT THE MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT OF ORANGE COUNTY ELSINORE VALLEY MISSILE WATER DISTRICT. FOR THE REASONS STATED WE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND IN ADDITION TO THAT IT'S THE CONCEPT THAT IF YOU LEGITIMIZE THIS USE OF THE SAFE DRINKING WATER THANK YOU CAN USE THAT ELSEWHERE TO AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT. IT SAYS ARE NERVOUS THANK YOU. SURE MEMBERS IN THREE MILLION ON BEHALF OF MESA WATER DISTRICT AND US INCLUDED VALLEY WATER AGENCY WE ECHO THE SAME COMMENTS AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM AQUA THANK YOU. CHRIS CON REPRESENT THE COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. OKAY -- OTHER FOLKS WORRIES CONCERNS RAIMESBEFORE THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS THAN A DOLLY. WELL. I HAVE WINNERS AND LOSERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND SO. PERSONALIZED APPRECIATE AUTHOR TRYING TO AT LEAST HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT I LAID OFF THIS BILL AND OTHER HOUSE. AND YOU KNOW I I REPRESENT MILLIE HUNDREDS OF LITTLE. SMALL WATER DISTRICTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET ALL THE STANDARDS THAT ARE PLACED ON THEM. AND HAVE NO ABILITY BILL EVEN RAISE RATES BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AND PEOPLE ARE GONNA RAISE RATES ARE HAVING A HARD TIME STAYING IN THEIR HOME. THEY'RE IN SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES. THE RATE WOULD BE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER HALL PER HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH VOLUME IN THESE SMALL TOWNS IN. THE TOWN THAT. WHEN MY KIDS GO TO SCHOOL IS FACED WITH THIS EXACT PROBLEM? IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN REGULATED IN WHERE WE WE HAVE HIGHER STANDARDS. THAT WERE PUT ON THEM IN THE WHEN THEY FIRST DEVELOP THEIR WATER SYSTEMS [inaudible] SO [inaudible] IS. AT IT AT THE SAME POINT. THEY HAVE TO PERFORM. THE REGULATIONS AND THEY END UP. GOING BANKRUPT IT OR NOT THEY CAN'T GET WHERE THEY WILL WE WHEN THEY'RE FORCED TO GO SO -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY I MEAN AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S THIS BILL IS BASICALLY SAYING YOU CAN OFTEN BUT I ON THE OTHER HAND I HAVE ALL OF MY LARGE PURVEYORS THAT ARE. WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE THAT THIS FIGHT IS GOING TO GET USED. TO OFFSET THE COST AND YOU KNOW AS I'VE OFTEN SAID IN CALIFORNIA IS A VERY DIVERSE STATE AND ONE SIZE FITS ALL REGULATIONS. DON'T ALWAYS WORK IN CALIFORNIA THESE COMMUNITIES CAN'T. COMPLY THERE'S JUST NO WAY THEY CAN COMPLY AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING THEM. OPT OUT. SO AS A STATEMENT MORE THAN IT IS OF IT I WOULD [inaudible] YOU KNOW. WE JUST BAILED OUT IN MY OPINION. YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WITH. CAP AND TRADE MONIES. TO DO WATER WHICH IS. AND IT'S LIKE THE TRAIN IT DOESN'T REALLY REDUCE CARBON IS THE WRONG AND I'M I'M A THROW IT OUT THERE BECAUSE IT JUST TICKS ME OFF THAT WE ARE. TAXIS ALMOND DIVERTING IT TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS THAT JUST AREN'T RIGHT. SO WE DO THAT KIND OF STUFF ALL THEIR IS WRONG. SO BUT TO FORCE REGULATIONS ON A COMMUNITY THAT CAN'T AFFORD IT AND THESE IT WE TALK ABOUT HELPING POOR PEOPLE ALL DAY LONG HERE. AND WE REALLY DON'T WE HURT THEM BY FORCING THEM AND SO WE NEED TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT'S IN THE WATER AND THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE RISK OF WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW THE AT PARTS PER BILLION. GREAT THAT WATER NOT SO. I'M A LOSS FOR HOW WE ACTUALLY GO FOR BECAUSE I HAVE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT A EVEN MORE NOW THAT I'M IN THE SENATE. THAT ARE FACED WITH THESE REGULATIONS AND CAN'T MAKE IT WORK [inaudible] SO -- I'M. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BILLS AND GET OUT HERE NOT I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M INCLINED TO WANT. pAND NOT ON THE BACKS OF SOMEBODY ELSE WE NEED TO HAVE EXEMPTIONS FOR THESE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO EXEMPT OUT OF SOME OF THESE CRAZY. REGULATIONS THAT THEY'RE IN. OKAY WELL OF COURSE THE BILL THIS BILL DOESN'T GO DID CRAZY REGULATIONS AND BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT SAYS IF YOU WELL FIRST OF ALL. YOU CAN OPT OUT AND GO TO STATE WATER BOARD RIGHT NOW. AND MY EXPERT HERE WILL TALK ABOUT WEIGHT SO IF YOU'RE COUNTY. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO LOCAL OVERSIGHT COULD YOU CAN AFFORD IT BECAUSE OF FEES DON'T PAY FOR IT GOES TO THE STATE WATER BOARD. AND OUR LAST MY EXPERT HERE WHERE DID THOSE FEES COMES FROM WHEN PEOPLE OPT OUT. THANK YOU AUTHORED -- THROUGH THE CHAIR. THIS IS THE ISSUE THIS IS THE ISSUE WE FACING IN THE AND THE ISSUE WE FACE IS. LET ME ADDRESS PARTY PROP TWENTY SIX BECAUSE HIS AN ALLEYWAY SECOND OKAY WHERE ALL RIGHT WHO IS WHO HAS TO PAY THE FEES RIGHT NOW PLEASE ANSWER BACK RIGHT AND NOW THE LOCAL PRIMACY AGENCY. GETS FEES FROM THOSE JURISDICTION THOSE WATER SYSTEMS THAT THEY REGULATE. IF THEY GIVE THE FEEDBACK TO THE STATE. THE STATE WILL GET IT FROM THE BROUGHT A POT. SO THAT IS WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE EFFICIENCY OF THIS BILL. RIGHT NOW THE STATE USES. I'M THAT MUCH BROADER FUND THAT HAS MULTIPLE FUNDING SOURCES THE LOCALS ERNIE HAVE. THAT ONE SOURCE WHICH IS THEIR SMALL DRINKING WATER SYSTEM AND SINCE WE WHEN WE SUPPORTED THE POLICY FOR THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. JOURNEY PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS SINCE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE WATER BOARD WE PUT AN EVEN BIGGER SQUEEZE WE SUPPORT THAT THE DISADVANTAGED. SHOULD GET SUPPORT BUT NOW WE HAVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT CAN ONLY CHARGE A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A FOR A SERVICE THAT COSTS YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THAT COMMUNITY. SO WE DO SEE THIS AS A WAY OF BASICALLY USING THE SAME FUNDING MECHANISM THE STATE. IT'S CURRENTLY USING AND WOULD BE USING ON THE SELF SAME SYSTEMS IF WE HAD TO GIVE THEM BACK. SO THERE'S NO CHANGE IN THE FIELD. THIRTY THIS ISN'T A NEW TAX THIS ISN'T A NEW PROGRAM IT'S SIMPLY ALLOWING THE LOCALS TO KEEP THE PROGRAM RATHER THAN THE STATE TAKING THE PROGRAM BACK. AND I CAN TELL YOU WE HAVE DONE SOME PRELIMINARY NUMBERS AND I HAVEN'T COMPLETELY DRUNK LOCAL KOOL-AID NOT SAYING EVERY LOCAL JURISDICTION IS BETTER OR MORE EFFICIENT. BUT WE CAN SEE WE CAN SHOW A FIFTEEN OR 20% REDUCTION IN COST OVERRULED IF THE LOCALS KEEP THE PROGRAM FOR ALL THOSE REASONS AT YOUR LOCAL LBJ'S EXPLAINED. SO LET ME SAY THAT IF THE LOCALS. FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T DO THIS PROGRAM. THEY WILL THEY CAN ALL OPT OUT ALL GO TO THE STATE AND THE FEES YOU WILL PAY. WITH THE SAME WE'RE TALKING ON TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW THERE WILL BE NO CHANGE IN FEES IF EVERY AGENCY GAVE UP. COMPARED TO THIS PROGRAM HERE. THE ONLY CHANGE THIS MAKES IS TO SAY THAT THE LOCALS CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK THE FEES WILL NOT CHANGE [inaudible] ASSUMING. THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE OPTED OUT ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. SO IF THE COURT THE PRESS CAN HEAR IS. DO THEY OPT OUT WE NO LONGER HAVE LOCAL CONTROL AND OF COURSE THEN THE FEES ARE PAID BY THESE OTHER WATER PRODUCERS OR DO WE ALLOW WORD. LOCALS TO DO THE INSPECTION AND THE FEES ARE PAID POINT IS FEES WON'T CHANGE WHETHER THEY OPT OUT OR THEY GO INTO THIS PROGRAM END. SINCE THE FEES WON'T CHANGE. YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE OBJECTING. I REALLY DOUBT. ALL THIS DOES IS ENSURE LOCAL CONTROL THANK YOU. YES YES OKAY. SO THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO GUARDRAILS ON THIS PROGRAM SO WHAT ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE A% SITUATION WHERE EVEN COUNTIES THAT ARE OTHERWISE SELF SUSTAINABLE WILL OPT INTO THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE WHITE WHY WOULD THEY NOT YOU EITHER THEY HAVE. TO RE ASSESS THE RATES AND COLLECT THE REVENUE WILL. OR THEY CAN HAVE THE STATE WATER BOARD DO THAT WITH A GIANT SUBSIDY FROM OUR MEMBERS. ONE OF OUR WORK CONCERNED THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO NEXUS BETWEEN THE FUNDING SOURCE AND WHO BENEFITS FROM THIS PROGRAM ONE OF THE REASONS AS JUSTIN EXPLAINED THAT THIS PAIN DELEGATES THIS PROGRAM. IS BECAUSE IT SAVES THE STATE MONEY BUT THE STATE HAS NO SKIN IN THE GAME UNDERNEATH THIS PROGRAM AGAIN THEY'VE GONE TO DRINKING WATER FEES. WITHOUT. EXAMINING ANY ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES AS ONE OF THE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION SAID NOT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS BILL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERY. COUNTY IS GOING TO BE RETURNING THERE AT THE READY TO THE STATE WITH WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM BUT EVERY COUNTY WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS INCENTIVE TO OPT INTO THIS PROGRAM AND THE LATEST AMENDMENTS. ALLOW THE STATE WATER BOARD TO REACH OUT TO ALL TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT IN -- PA OFFER THEM THE ABILITY TO BECOME ONE AND PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM THAT IT IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING TO US -- MISTER CHAIR. BOB I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT. IF IF THEY ARE SELF SUSTAINING. ALL THAT MONEY UNDER THIS BILL WOULD GO IN AND THE STATE. IT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO THEM THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO IF THERE ARE SELF SUSTAINING NOW. THAN THE STATE WATER BOARD ISN'T GOING TO HAVE TO ADD NEW FEES. SO THE ONLY WAY THIS IS AFFECTED HIS IF YOU HAVE A COUNTY WITH MANY SMALL SYSTEMS. AND THEY CAN'T MAKE IT ON THEIR OWN. THEN THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO THE STATE. AND THE AND THE CHOICE IS EITHER IT'S DONE BY THE LOCALS. AND PAID FOR BY THROUGH THE THIS SYSTEM OR IT'S PAID THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND THE STATE DOES IT. SO THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IS IT LOCAL CONTROL OR STATE CONTROL THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THE MONEY IS ALLOCATED PERIOD. BUT I'M A NUMBERS GUY -- I KNOW DAVID WOLF -- WANTED. TO QUICKLY -- VOICES OPPOSITION YEAH MISTER CHAIRMAN THANKS FOR SQUEEZING ME AND DAVID WILL FOR THE HARRY JACK HARRY JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE WE DO HAVE PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX CONCERNS. MEMBERS NOT BECAUSE OF THE TAX PROP TWENTY SIX MAKES VERY CLEAR THAT THE REGULATORY FEE EXEMPTIONS NEEDS TO GO TO THE COST OF PROVIDING THE SERVICE AND I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE. THAT THE COST OF PROVIDING THE SERVICE. QUALITY IS MET IF LARGER LOCAL PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES ARE SUBSIDIZING SMALLER ONES I DO BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THIS BILL AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE OPPOSED THANK YOU. CANCEL ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY. ALL I CAN RESPOND PLEDGE COUNCIL HAS AND FOUND THE PROBLEM WITH WITH. WITH THAT TWENTY SIX NOR DID THEY THINK THIS IS THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING THAT BECAUSE THERE'S THIS BILL IS SILENT ON A FUNDING SOURCE THAT HASN'T BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET IT'S GOING TO BE IF THIS BILL BECAME LAW IT WOULD BE UP TO THE STATE. WATER BOARD TO DETERMINE HOW. TO AT SS THE FEES TO FUND THIS PROGRAM SO IT'S AN IMP IT'S A QUESTION OF IMPLEMENTATION HOW ARE THEY GOING TO IMPLEMENT IT. MISTER CHAIR SORRY MATT MATT JUST TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS. AS YOU CLEARLY UNDERSTAND. WE CANNOT SLICE AND DICE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS DOWN TO THE MINUTIA WE PUT AND KEEP DRINKING WATER FUNDS. AND DRINKING WATER COSTS IN THE SAME PART WE DON'T TAKE MONEY FOR MY FOOD PROGRAM. AND PUT IT INTO THE WATER PROGRAM THAT IS A PROBABLY A PROP TWENTY SIX VIOLATION. BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. ALL THAT MONEY GOES INTO ONE PRODUCT WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD. AND IT'S DISTRIBUTED ACCORDINGLY SAME WITH AYE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. OUR DRINKING WATER PROGRAM FUNDS FIND ALL THE ACTIVITIES WE REQUIRED AND DRINKING WATER SO. THERE MAY BE SOME DISPROPORTIONATE ALLERGY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A LITTLE LEGITIMATE EXPENSE BECAUSE WHETHER YOU ARE A FIFTEEN CONNECTION A THIRTY CONNECTION -- HUNDRED NINETY NINE CONNECTION THE MONEY'S ALL COMING IN FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AND THAT'S TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR DRINKING WATER SO WE DISPEL AND SO IT IS LEAD COUNSEL THIS BILL THE TWENTY SIX ARGUMENT THANK YOU OKAY -- LARA. DIFFERENCES OF INTERPRETATION HERE. OKAY JANSSON CASKEY. I KNOW THAT WE PRIORITIZE CONSOLIDATION. AND WORDS FEASIBLE WORDS FEASIBLE. THIS HAVE -- CURTAILING AFFECT ON THAT. GOAL THAT WE SET UP TO OTHERS IS THERE ARE THERE MANY SEPARATE BILLS DEALING WITH CONSOLIDATION SEPARATE PROGRAMS THIS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT WE JUST PASSED OUT OF ASSEMBLY -- ENVIRONMENTAL -- QUALITY -- A BILL BY SENATOR CAMPBELL GYRO CALLING FOR MORE CONSOLIDATION THIS BILL HAS. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. SENATOR WORKERS WHO THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY RESPOND WE DID OFFERED TO THE WATER AGENCIES A PROPOSED AMENDMENT WHICH THE AUTHORS COMFORTABLE WITH. AND THAT IS FOR THE L. P. A.'S TO REPORT TO THE STATE WATER BOARD IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS ON WHICH SMALL WATER SYSTEMS ARE ELIGIBLE OR WOULD BE ADVISABLE TO EIGHT TO LOOK AT CONSOLIDATION FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION AND WE UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THAT. AND I THINK SENATE TO A BATES IS OFFICE RAISE THAT ISSUE WITH US AND WE CAN COPE WITH THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BRING THE COST DOWN. FOR THOSE UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND I THINK THE LPA PROGRAM HAS NOT HAD THAT MANDATE ALTHOUGH THEY DO DO IT CLASSIC COUNTY DOES DO IT ROUTINELY. AND OTHERS DO BUT WE WOULD ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT WILLINGLY. TO ENSURE THAT L. P. A.'S REPORT ON THE VIABILITY OF THESE SYSTEMS TO REDUCE THE COST TO EVERYBODY. NOT JUST OF THIS MOST WATER SYSTEM FUND. FONG SIR ALL OPTING IN. MY NIGHT [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] OKAY. I MEAN I AM [inaudible] THE BILL [inaudible] OKAY. YEAH I REALLY THINK CAN. THE FRONT IS THE BOARD ALREADY HAS. YOU KNOW THE ABILITY. TO REYES FEES UNDER EXISTING AUTHORITY CAN'T RAISE RATES WITHOUT GOING TO THE BUDGET PROCESS -- RIGHT. SO I I MEAN I I THINK THIS IS I I I HEAR THE ARGUMENTS THE OPPOSITION AYE AYE IS ONE OF THOSE. COST BENEFIT WAIT I JUST THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW WITH OR WITHOUT THE BILL RATES YOU KNOW. VERY WILL GO UP YEAH IF AND WHEN THE LOCALS GIVE BACK A THIRD OF THE STATE BECAUSE LOCALS CAN AFFORD. TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT OF I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL -- BUT TO DO CLEARLY. THE VALUE TO THIS -- YEAH I SO. TERM CASKEY S. AS MOVE. IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- SO I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION I WOULD LOVE IT IF THERE WERE SOME OTHER WAY TO FUND THIS AND AGAIN IT IS SILENT BUT WE DO EXPECT THE WATER BOARD TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING. IT'S BEEN LEGAL FOR A LONG TIME. THERE WILL BE NO NET INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT SENT HIM TO THE SYSTEM. OTHER THAN FOR A FEW STE FOR A FEW COUNTIES WHICH CANNOT AFFORD TO DO THIS WHERE THE FEES ARE NOT ADEQUATE THEN THAT WILL BE SPREAD ACROSS. HE WOULD ALSO BE SPREAD ACROSS IF THEY SIMPLY. DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND SIMPLY GAVE THE OVERSIGHT TO FOR FINANCIAL REASONS TO THE STATE. THE ONLY THING THIS REALLY DOES IS ALLOW LOCAL OVERSIGHT. WHEN THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN? TO OKAY CURRENT MOOD BY SEVERAL CASKEY CENTERPIECE KALRA. ITEM NUMBER SIX AB FOR OH TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS. TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLEN HI ALLEN HI BATES DOLLY [inaudible] HILL [inaudible] SKINNER [inaudible] STERN. I CASKEY.

IMPACTED COMMUNITIES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY BUT THE CURRENT BOARD HAS BEEN UNRESPONSIVE. AIR MONITORS IN SOME AREAS INDICATE A HUMAN CANCER RISK OF OVER THREE HUNDRED CANCER FROM MILLION ASTHMA HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE THREE TIMES HIGHER IN IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THAN THEY ARE IN OTHER COMMUNITIES. THESE CONDITIONS ARE ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR NEW LEADERSHIP SAN DIEGO NEEDS A PRO ACTIVE BOARD THAT WILL ADOPT POLICIES TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH ESPECIALLY IF. HE'S ME IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED. THE NEED FOR CHANGE AND REPRESENTATION IS CLEAR THE SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD IS AN ANOMALY AMONG THE LARGE AIR DISTRICTS IN THE STATE IN THE PRODUCT OF A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD PROVISIONS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED. TO EXAM SAN DIEGO COUNTY FROM HAVING A DIVERSE AND REPRESENTATIVE BOARD. THE NEED FOR DIRECTED ACTION IS ALSO QUITE CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE TRANSPARENCY IS COMPLETELY MISSING -- ON THE WEBSITE FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE NO PENDING PERMITS ARE CURRENT PERMITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE WHEN DATA IS REQUESTED WHERE THERE IS A PROVISION FOR THAT THERE IS A RESPONSE OF NO DATA AVAILABLE. MONITORING DATA FROM EXISTING MONITORS TAKES YEARS TO BE PROCESSED TWENTY SIXTEEN DATA WAS JUST RECENTLY -- RELEASE OTHER LARGE DISTRICTS HAVE ROBUST PUBLIC INFORMATION AUTHENTIC COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND AMBITIOUS K. -- REDUCTION PROGRAMS OBSCENE DIEGO DESERVES AN AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT THAT ENCOURAGES AND SUPPORTS ITS CAPABLE AND COMMITTED STAFF TO TAKE BOLD AND EFFECTIVE ACTION. TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WE WE VERY MUCH ALIVE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW [inaudible] NUMBER. OKAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS AND WE ALSO SUPPORT THE CHANGES THAT THE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE -- HAS MADE -- AND ALSO THE AMENDMENT TO PUSH THE CAR BROUGHT IT TO THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS A HAVE REQUESTED SO WE WOULD REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. JONATHAN CLAY HERE REPRESENTED COUNTY SAN DIEGO WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD CONCERNS AT THIS MEASURE BUT THROUGH THE HARD WORK OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA HIS STAFF AND THE SPONSORS WE'VE ADDRESSED ALL OF OUR CONCERNS -- WITH THE MEASURE.

FIVE IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER CASKEY OF THE SEMESTER VERY QUICKLY -- I REPRESENT THE NORTH COUNTY ARE CITIES IN SAN DIEGO AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THE WAITING ON THE BILL BASICALLY PUTS THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE WITHOUT ANY -- REGULATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO COME THROUGH SO I MEAN OPPOSE IT TODAY I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA YEAH HE IS REALLY. A ONE OF THE VERY SPECIAL MEMBERS THAT REALLY WORKS FINE ADDRESSING THINGS THAT ARE HAVE TO DO WITHOUT. YOU KNOW THE BALANCE HE THERE AND FAN DIEGO WE HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS IN NORTH COUNTY TO FEAR CONSTANTLY AND NO WORK I THINK THE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES A HUGE. ONE AND SO IN THESE ARE THINGS THAT CONCERN ME ON JUST WANT TO GET THAT ON THE RECORD BUT YOU KNOW IF I CAN BE OF SERVICE AND HELP IN TERMS OF GOING FORWARD. CERTAINLY WOULD WOULD DO THAT. BECAUSE THERE ARE I WOULD HAVE NOT COULD DISAGREE WITH THAT THE SENATOR I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THE CURRENT BOARD HAS NO SEATS FOR ANY NORTH COUNTY CITY -- THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR NORTH COUNTY CITIES TO HAVE A VOTING SEAT ON THIS BOARD. ALL RIGHT BY I AGREE WITH YOU ONE SPECIAL MEMBERS I WILL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES THAT'S THE MOVE BY CINEMA CASKEY -- THIRTY PLEASE CALL. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB FOR TWENTY THREE THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE BATES. BATES NO DOLLY [inaudible] HILL [inaudible] SKINNER. STERN I CASKEY LIVE LIKE OWSKI I OKAY WILL -- LEAVE IT OPEN AT THE TWO TO ONE VOTE -- LET OTHER PEOPLE THANK YOU OKAY WHEN I CALLED CUSTOMER GALLAGHER -- 2% ITEM EIGHT THIS IS EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY CHRISSY READY. DO YOU WANT [inaudible] ONE WAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS AND AND I I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIRMAN -- AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD ON THIS BILL AND AND THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS. AND I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- DE THROUGH F. THERE ON PAGE. SEVENTEEN AND THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- I WANTED TO DISCUSS ON THE OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO HAVE I THINK. SOME PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS -- THERE BUT I CAN'T COMMIT TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS TIME -- THE MOST NOTABLY BECAUSE THEY WOULD LARGELY PRECLUDE THE BUILDING OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WHICH REPRESENTS THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF OF THE HOUSING AND THAT WAS BURNED -- YOU KNOW IN THE CAMPFIRE -- SO MY DISTRICT IS A MANY OF YOU KNOW STILL IN THE MIDST OF RECOVERING. FROM THE DEADLY ESTAMOS DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE. IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY NOW WHICH DEVASTATED NOT. IN YANKEE HILL. A SECOND DISASTER IS CURRENTLY -- UNFOLDING AS THE AREA STRUGGLES TO ABSORB. THOUSANDS OF FIRE VICTIMS. THE PROBLEM IS IS QUITE SIMPLY THAT THERE ISN'T HOUSING AVAILABLE THE CAMP FIRE DESTROYED 14%. A BEAT COUNTIES HOUSING STOCK ALMOST FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOMES -- THE COUNTY FELL SEVENTEEN PLACES MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE STATE. ON THE AFFORDABILITY INDEX IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRE -- THE RENTAL MARKET VACANCY RATE ALSO FELL TO NEARLY 0%. AFTER THE FIRE IN ALL OF THIS IS MAKING IT VERY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. FOR CAN'T FIRE VICTIMS AND OTHERS AS THEY STRUGGLE TO FIND HOUSING EVEN HAD PEOPLE THAT WERE -- YOU VIC DID OUT OF THEIR RENTALS -- TO MAKE ROOM. FOR REMOVING AND FIRE VICTIMS SO -- AND EVEN THOUGH MANY WANT TO STAY IN THIS AREA WHERE THEY HAVE JOBS AND FAMILY AND AND COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS. THIS IS ALL MAKING IT VERY HARD I WAS JUST RECENTLY AT THE THE GRADUATION THAT WE HAVE PREPARED ICE HIGH SCHOOL WHO ARE ABLE TO HAVE THAT GRADUATION BACK UP ON THE CAMPUSES OF WONDERFUL DAY. AND THE PRINCIPLE OF THAT HIGH SCHOOL IS A GUY NAMED LORELEI HALL AND THE THE THE KIDS THERE WERE CHANT LILY CHANTING HIS NAME. HE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE KIDS. JULY HALL IS MOVIE BECAUSE HE CANNOT FIND. ADEQUATE HOUSING AREA MOVE INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- AND THIS IS JUST ONE HIGH PROFILE STORY OF OF WHAT IS GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE REGION. THEY WILL TAKE YEARS FOR THE COMMUNITY DESTROYED BY THE FIRE TO REBUILD IN THE MEAN TIME. EVACUEES NEED TO FIND STABLE HOUSING. MOREOVER NOT EVERYONE WILL WANT TO REBUILD. MANY WILL WANT TO FIND PERMANENT HOUSING AND IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS. THEY MAY NOT WANT TO GO BACK UP ON THE RIDGE. WE ALSO HAVE FEMA SITES. IN SEVERAL OF THE CITIES. IN YUBA CITY AND TWO OF THEM IN OR A BILL -- IN ORLAND. WE HAVE A FOUR HUNDRED UNIT FEMA SITE THAT'S GOING INTO GRIDLEY -- THIS WEEK BUT ALL THAT IS TEMPORARY HOUSING EIGHTEEN MONTHS. MAX IN THOSE FEMA CAMPS. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO GET HOUSING ONLINE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL PRECARIOUSLY HOUSE AT BEST LIVING WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY. OR MAYBE IN AN RV OR TRAILER -- AT WORST LIVING IN A TENT -- NHà LIVING ON THE STREETS. OTHERS HAVE AND WILL BE FORCED TO LEAVE THE AREA OR EVEN THE STATE WE RISK LOSING TEACHERS POLICE OFFICERS AND VITAL WORK FORCE THAT WE NEED -- IN OUR REGION LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE EVEN TALKED ABOUT LEAVING IF THEY CANNOT FIND HOUSING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. SO ALL THIS IS IS IT IS AN UNPRECEDENTED ISSUE FOR US AB FOR THIRTY THE CAMPFIRE HOUSING ASSISTANCE ACT WILL HELP CREATE HOUSING IN THE REGION. BUT CREATE A NARROWLY APPLIED STREAMLINED MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR BUILDING HOMES IN THAT REGION IMPACTED BY THIS FIRE. THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO SELECCIONAR ACTED REGION. AND I WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS QUICKLY SO THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS. THERE ARE MANY LIMITS ON THE STREAMLINED APPROVAL IT HAS TO BE WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS. OF THE SELECT CITIES -- SO NO SPRAWL INTO THE UNINCORPORATED PARTS OF THE COUNTY -- IT INCLUDES PROTECTIONS IN HERE. THAT IT CANNOT BE BUILT IN A FLOOD PLAIN CAN BE BUILT IN A WILD FIRE HAZARD ZONE. BUT I COULD NOT BE ON ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS INC INCLUDING AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN PROTECTED. BY CONSERVATION OR THAT ARE THEN INCLUDE ENDANGERED HABITAT -- THAT OUR WETLANDS. ALL WOULD BE PROHIBITED ADDITIONALLY ANY BENNY DEVELOPMENT UNDER THIS BILL WOULD HAVE TO BE BUILT ACCORDING TO LEED GOLD. STANDARDS. AT THE DEVELOPMENT AGAIN HAS TO BE CONSISTENT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN AN AREA THAT IS ZONED IN THAT CITY. FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT -- IN A COULD NOT IN A FOR INSTANCE BEES ON ON COULD NOT BE BUILT ON SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ZONED. CURRENTLY IN THE GENERAL PLAN. EVERY EVERY JURISDICTION INCLUDING THIS BILL IS SUPPORTIVE AND I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD -- SIERRA CLUB IS NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL -- AND AS I SAID I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK -- AS YOU MOVE THIS BEFORE BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS TOOL IN PLACE. I IN AN AREA THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS IT AND SO I WOULD I WOULD JUST ASK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY -- WITH ME TO TESTIFY HAVE ANGELA COUNSELOR. VICTIM OF THE CAMPFIRE AND ALSO OWNER OF SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT CONSULTING. AND ORVILLE CITY MANAGER TOM LANDAU -- SO THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE THOUGH. THANK YOU MY NAME'S ANGELA KESSLER I ACTUALLY HAVE THREE JOB SAVE TWO HOME BASED BUSINESSES THAT I LOST. I AM THE CEO PRESIDENT OF SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION WERE A GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED AROUND THE WORLD THAT -- MANAGE STING ABILITY AND THEN I DO AS A PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY IS MY CAREER AND I'M ALSO A FULL TIME LECTURER CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHICO. I LIVED IN PARADISE FOR TEN YEARS AND I WAS VERY LUCKY TO LIVE IN THIS WONDERFUL PLACE. AND ON THAT DAY DID LOSE MY HOME LOSS TO VEHICLES AND ANOTHER PROPERTY THAT I OWN TO TWENTY THREE ACRES OF FORESTED LAND. THE FIREFIGHTERS TO SAVE OUR BARN IN OUR RV. SO I ACTUALLY HAVE SEVEN INSURANCE CLAIMS AND RECOVERING FROM THE CAMPFIRE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A FULL TIME JOB AND I DO TURN JOHN JOBS RIGHT NOW FROM MY REGULAR WORK. IN ORDER JUST TO WORK ON OUR OWN INSURANCE CLAIMS FOR OUR FAMILY TRYING TO PUT OUR LIVES BACK TOGETHER. BUT IF I MAY SHARE WITH YOU -- THESE ARE SOME ARTIFACTS ABOUT WHAT'S LEFT OF OUR LIVES THESE ARE SOME GIFTS THAT I DUG THROUGH FROM FOUR DAYS OF SLUDGE AFTER THE RAINS HIT AFTER FIVE WEEKS WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO RETURN HOME. I DON'T KNOW IF I MAY PASS THEM AROUND IF THAT'S THE CASE BUT I LIVED IN EUROPE FOR TEN YEARS AND THESE ARE THE MILITARY COINS COMMANDERS GAVE TO ME FOR PHILANTHROPIC WORKS AS AN INTERNATIONAL BAKER. HELPING OUR EX PATS AND OUR MILITARY OVERSEAS. THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT OF OUR LIFE IF YOU'D LIKE FREE. AFTER FOUR DAYS OF TAKING TWENTY HOURS OF CLEANING THOSE THOSE ARE AND HOW THEY LOOK TODAY -- MY CAMPFIRE STORIES START AT SEVEN FORTY ONE ON THE NEWS I HEARD IT THAT THERE IS A FIRE AND PULL GO TWELVE MILES AWAY. I CALLED MY FATHER IN LAW IS NINETY ONE YEARS OLD TOLD AND START PACKING CALL HIS NINETY YEAR OLD GIRLFRIEND. TELL HER START PACKING IN COME ON OVER AT TEN AM HE ARRIVED AND THEY WERE SMOKING THE CANYON AND WE'RE THE FIRST THE STREET WHERE THE LAST STREET LEAVING PARADISE. ON A MAJOR CORDER CALLED SKY WAY AND WE HAD SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE CANYON SO I WAS THE FURTHEST AREA FROM THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE TO SO SURPRISED. THE WE DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY CODE RED ALERTS THERE WERE NO SIRENS BLARING THERE WERE NO TELEPHONE CALLSFROM CODE RED. AND THERE WAS SILENCE AND SO -- WHEN HE DID COME OVER I STAND ON THE CASH SAID HE DâN WHEN YOU SEE FIRE CHRIS THAT HILL YOU HOLLER AT ME BECAUSE THEN I KNEW WAS GAME ON I WAS GRABBING ALL MY LOOK? MIGHT BUSINESS DOCUMENTS AS MANY AS I COULD GRAB. SO TEN TWENTY RUN BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM AND THEY'RE MY HOUSE AT THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET IS ON FIRE WE GO OUTSIDE TO TRY TO EVACUATE PUT HIM IN HIS CAR IT GET IN MY TRUCK. AND THE WIND IS FULL ON BLOWING STRAIGHT OUT ME. FROM MY NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ON FIRE ACROSS THE STREET BUT ALL THE EMBERS JUST BLOWING INTO MY OTHER NEIGHBORS HOUSE STRANGEST THING YOU COULD IMAGINE. SO IF YOU VISITED PARADISE YOU WONDERED WHY USER ONE HOUSE STANDING THE WHOLE REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS GONE IT JUST CREATE ITS OWN WHEN IT WAS SO BIZARRE AND VERY SURREAL. AND FROM THERE WE EVACUATED TO CORNING ENDED UP IN A HOTEL WITH EIGHTY SIX OTHER FAMILIES FROM PARADISE. AND FRIDAY WE STARTED REALIZING THAT THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ACTUALLY GONE IN JUST THE SORROW AND NOT REALLY HEARTBREAK OF IT ALL. AND AFTER I STARTED FEELING REALLY BAD FOR MYSELF I AM HELPED GOT A LOT OF HELP FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO JUST STARTED SENDING MONEY IN CLOSE AND I SPENT THE ENTIRE WEEKEND JUST CLOTHING AND FEEDING PEOPLE. FROM THEIR RETURN TO HOUSING WHERE WHAT WE GOING TO DO AND SO I WAS ABLE TO SECURE A HOUSE FOR A FAMILY THAT'S VERY TEMPORARY THIS NICE GENTLEMAN JUST LIKE STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT. BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALIZED IT WAS TWO THREE YEARS AND I CAROL IN POSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE REALLY DO NEED HOUSING WE ARE OF ALL SOCIOECONOMIC CLASSES -- FOR ALL PROFESSIONALS WE DON'T WE REALLY DO WANT TO STAY IN OUR AREA WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICES EVERY DAY I SPENT HOURS AND HOURS ON ZILLOW LOOKING. FOR OPPORTUNITIES AND WHETHER IT'S RENTALS WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE MULTI FAMILY SINGLE FAMILY MANY CURVATURE OF SPACE OUR EMPLOYERS ALL HAD EMPLOYEES AFFECTED FROM PARADISE THAT HOW TO EITHER LEAVE THE AREA. SO NOW WE NEED TO RECRUIT OUR WORK FORCE BACK TO THE AREA AND WE CAN ONLY DO THAT IF WE HAVE HOUSING SO I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY AND HAVING ME BE ABLE TO JOIN YOU YES SIR. HELLO NONTON LANDAU I AM THE INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE CITY FOR A BILL I AM HERE REPRESENTING THE CITY COUNCIL -- STRONGLY SUPPORTS ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR THIRTY IN HOPE JEWEL PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

DESPORTIVA AN INFLUX OF SURVIVORS THIS IS A THOUSAND PIECE PUZZLE OF WHICH THIS BILL IS A PART.

I CAN'T SPEAK FOR WHAT PROCESS THEY KNOW WE HAD A MISTER LANDAU I THINK IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME CITY ADMINISTRATOR COULD SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE TO IF IF IF IT'S APPROPRIATE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT YEAH. I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE IF I'M BUILDING APARTMENT COMPLEX A JONES I BY RIGHT GET TO BUILD.

FOLKS WANT TO RAISE OPPOSITION CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I WITH THEM HI MATTHEW BAKER WITH PLANNING CONSERVATION THEY AT FIRST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO THE AUTHOR HAD TO THE COMMITTEE FOR STEPPING IN SO LATE ON THIS BILL. WE KNEW THERE WERE PEOPLE WORKING ON IT WE HAD CONFIDENCE THAT WAS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT WE FIND -- THAT IS NOT NEARLY AS FAR AS IT. WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE TO BE PASSING THIS COMMITTEE AND AFTER MULTIPLE PLEASE FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS FOR PC ON A STEP IN AND DO SOMETHING I FIND MYSELF IN THE UNFORTUNATE POSITION OF BEING HERE? TO TO VOICE OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PCL IS EXTREMELY CONCERNED. AND HAS THE UTMOST SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THIS CAMPFIRE AS WE DO FOR ALL THE COULDN'T COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THAT HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THESE INCREASINGLY DEVASTATING FIRES IN RECENT YEARS. DETAILS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING AYE IDENTIFYING THE APPROPRIATE STREAMLINING MECHANISM FOR THE RECOVERY OF THESE COMMUNITIES. WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THIS APPROACH PRESENTED BY FOUR THIRTY IS THAT APPROPRIATE MECHANISM. AS RECENTLY AS LAST YEAR WE WORKED DILIGENTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE SANTA ROSA RECOVERY BILL -- TWO TWO SIX SEVEN THAT BILL BY COMPARISON OFFERED EXPLODED JUDICIAL REVIEW IS NOT A FULL SEQUENCE EMPTION. IT HAD STRICT INFILL REQUIREMENTS IT HAD STRICT TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR V. M. T. NGH G.. A HAD -- STRICT AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS AND STRONGER ANTI DISPLACEMENT CRITERIA THEN FOUR THIRTY DOES. EITHER THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR SUCH A BROAD TO QUICKLY ACTION OR FOR ANY KIND OF RECOVERY PLAN AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE SHOULD BE A RECOVERY PLAN. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- THE CENTER IS A BILL THE COUNTY AND THE CITY WERE WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATOR TO TO HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN PRESENTED AS PART OF THE BILL. AND AND IT WAS. ALMOST ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH AN ALREADY ADOPTED COMMUNITY THAT IT MASTER PLAN FOR FOR THE DOWNTOWN AREA. AND IT WAS. THE AREAS THAT WERE NOT PART OF THAT ADOPTED PLAN THAT THAT BECAME MOST DIVISIVE INSTALLED THE BILL [inaudible] THIS. YOU KNOW THAT THIS AND SAID THIS IS OUR OUR PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION TO THE AUTHOR TO HOLD THIS BILL AND TO DEVELOP SUCH A PLAN OFFERING SUCH A BROAD. THE QUICK REACTION JUST BASED ON GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED AND AND A BAD PRECEDENT FEDERAL PLANS JUST SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE THE KIND OF SPECIFIC SPECIFICITY. TO IDENTIFY PARCEL PACIFIC IMPACTS OR OR REGIONALLY CUMULATIVE IMPACTS -- YOU KNOW AND WE'RE TALKING A ABOUT NEW DEVELOPMENT THERE IS ALREADY A FULL SEQUEL EXEMPTION IN PLACE FOR REBUILDING. A PROPERTY THAT IS LOST IN A FIRE THIS IS ABOUT NEW CONSTRUCTION AND REGIONAL REGION WIDE RECOVERY THAT THERE SHOULD AND THAT KIND OF THAT THAT TO REQUIRE. A PLAN -- CROSS JURISDICTIONAL COOPERATIVE. PLAN WITH ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ON BUT THAT REBUILDING AND RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE -- AND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THAT PLAN THERE IS SIGNIFICANT LOCAL OPPOSITION AND THERE HAVE. BEEN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE OPTED TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL THAT HAVE BEEN MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED FROM THIS FIRE -- YOU KNOW WE WE URGE. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO GO BACK TO THIS COMMUNITY HOLD THE BILL TODAY GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPED. ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL PLAN. WITH ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT YOU KNOW IS TARGETED AT ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR THE REGION ADDRESSES OTHER STATE. ENVIRONMENTAL INEQUITY MANDATE. AND AND ALSO REALLY INSURERS THAT THESE COMMUNITIES INTO THAT WE DON'T REBUILD AND REPLICATE THE MISTAKES AND RISKS OF THE PACK -- WITH WITHOUT A PLAN IN PLACE. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE THREE MONEY MECHANISM. YEAH BUT WITHOUT SUCH A PLAN B. PURCHASE A NO VOTE RESPECTFULLY. THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS SUSAN JUDY THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. THE ANALYSIS PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE. I LIVE IN YANKEE HILL CALIFORNIA BOTH MY SONS LOST THEIR HOMES. MY YOUNGEST SON LOST IN ADDITION HIS FARM. ON THAT HE'S SPENT HIS WHOLE ADULT LIFE BUILDING. I'M. BUT NONETHELESS I OPPOSE -- AB. FOUR THIRTY I THINK THAT IF. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO REACH OUT AND PROVIDE AS MUCH HELP AS THEY CAN FOR PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES BUT IT'S NOT THE BILL THAT WILL DO THAT. I'M I THINK THAT IT IS AN END RUN AROUND SYKORA. AM I THINK THAT EXEMPTING BUILDERS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL. OF REGULATIONS THAT SUCH. A VERY BAD PRECEDENT -- AND AS HE JUST SAID I DON'T KNOW HIM -- IT IT IT IT SETS A PRECEDENT AND IT'S SO BROAD THAT IT TAKES AN WAY -- WAY TOO MUCH SO IT SETS ONCE ESTABLISHED THIS PRESIDENT CAN ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO MAKE CLAIMS ABOUT NEED AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE INCREASING. DISASTERS INCREASING WILDFIRES WE CAN SAY WE NEED THIS AND THEN JUST FOR A SEQUEL OUT AND SAY LET'S LET'S GET AROUND THIS. AB POOR THIRTY WAS EXPANDED IN THE VERY BEGINNING FROM ITS ORIGINAL STATE AND GOAL WHEN REP REPRESENTATIVE GALLAGHER INTRODUCED IT HE FOCUSED ON PRIMARILY ON CHICO AND OR AVAIL. BUT HE HAS SINCE ADDED IN IN THE AMENDMENTS THERE ARE THREE COUNTIES NOW SO NOW WE HAVE -- HOUSING SPREAD OUT IN THREE COUNTIES IN EIGHT CITIES OR AVAIL BAGS GREATLY WILLOWS ORLAND YUBA CITY CORNING IN LINE VOTE. THIS EXPANDING ASSAULT ON SEA QUEST. ANNA IS -- UNNECESSARY I THINK AND WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INFILL TODAY THERE ARE MANY POSSIBILITIES AND CHECKOUT FOR THAT. WE WE DON'T NEED TO IMMEDIATELY ABANDON SEQUOIA AND ALLOW THIS ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER TO GO ON THANK YOU. IF IT AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN. HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS RICHARD HERMAN I'M AN ATTORNEY ON GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA VERMELHA DEFENSE CENTER. BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION I PREVIOUSLY WORKED AS A CONSULTANT. FOR THE SENATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUBCOMMITTEE. ON LONG RANGE LAND USE PLAN A THE BACK IN THE SEVENTIES I'VE STUDIED GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE VALLEY FOR THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AND I'VE LITIGATED UNDER SYKORA GENERAL PLAN SUBDIVISION AND ALL THE LAND USE PLANNING AREAS. IT'S MY PERCEPTION THAT YOUR STAFF ANALYSIS ADDRESSES ALL OF THE ISSUES WHICH SERVE SHOULD SUPPORT A NO PASS AT THIS POINT. WE HEAR SUPPORT THE PCL RECOMMENDATION I BELIEVE YOU'VE HAD OTHER LOVE LETTERS COME IN FROM THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. WHAT THIS REALLY IS IS IT SAY? FREE PASS FOR LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENT AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL'S OWN TESTIMONY AND STATEMENTS SAID HOWEVER. MOST LARGE HOUSING PROJECTS SUCH AS WHAT IS NEEDED IN BUTTE COUNTY. SO WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS LARGE SCALE SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT. IT'S NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON INFILL DEVELOPMENT IN FACT THE STAFF. ANALYSIS FOR BOTH THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE OF THE ASSEMBLY AND ALSO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE LISTED ALL OF THE EMISSIONS THAT YOUR CONSULTANT ALSO RAISED SO. TO KEEP IT SHORT SINCE IT'S NEW áP NEW OUR OF OUR POSITION WOULD BE. THAT AT THIS POINT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH THIS BILL OTHER THAN COMPLETE NO AT THIS POINT. IT NEEDS TO PROBABLY BE A TO YOUR BILL IT NEEDS TO GO TO STUDY IT NEEDS TO TAKE SOME OF THE IT A DEN OF FIGHT INFORMATION. THAT YOU'RE CONSULTANT PRESENTED IN HER AND ALICE'S AND THAT NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT SO WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE REALLY THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDING THIS NEW HOUSING. WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO NEED TO BE OR THEY'RE GOING TO SACRAMENTO OR THEY COME TO CHECK ON THE OTHER REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AREA? IN THE ARE FOR COUNTY AREA. OR HAVE THEY ALREADY LEFT. THE ECONOMIC DISASTER THE DEL DISASTER ECONOMIC EXPERTS OF PRESENTED AT CHICO ON MAY NINTH SAID THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR 50% OF THEM ARE ALREADY GONE. IF I WORK FOR A LOOP THE PLAINTIFFS AGAINST P. JEANNIE I INTERVIEW THE DISASTER VICTIMS FROM PARADISE REGULATE. MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY GONE THERE REALLY GOING TO BE GONE THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE HERE THE NUMBER THAT IS NEEDED. TO PROVIDE HOUSING. FOR AS YOUR ANALYSTS SAID IS VERY VERY MUCH SMALLER THAN THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE BOARD BY THE OF THE AUTHOR. FINALLY I JUST LIKE TO SAY. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I WORKED CLOSELY WITH MR GALLAGHER ON THE ORVILLE CASE TONIGHT. HIGHLY RESPECT HIS ABILITY AND HIS REPRESENTATION OF OUR DISTRICT OUR OF IN THIS POINT WE DISAGREE. THIS IS NOT NEEDED AND AS YOUR STAFF WARRANT REPORT SHOWS THERE'S VERY VERY LITTLE SEQUEL A LITIGATION THAT'S COME OUT OF THIS IN OUR PARTICULAR AREA. THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE ON A LARGE SCALE. OF HOUSING THE ONLY HOUSING THAT'S BEEN CHALLENGING CHICO RECENTLY WAS CHALLENGED ON ISSUES OTHER THAN SEEK WHAT. AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE POINT THAT WAS MADE THAT THE GENERAL PLAN PROCESS DOES NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT. THE KIND OF ANALYSIS NEEDS TO BE DONE PARTICULARLY ON CUMULATIVE. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS SPECIFICALLY AS WELL FROM CARBON EMISSIONS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED REALLY REALLY HARD TO AVOID IN ORDER TO SAVE. AN ECO CATASTROPHE. THANK YOU THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT IS MADE BY THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL IS THAT -- EVEN IF SEE WHAT HASN'T BEEN USED TO CHALLENGE PROJECTS. IT. SLOWS DOWN [inaudible] THE CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT PERMITTING AND AND AND LIABILITY IN THEM AND PREDICTABILITY AND ALL THE REST. ACTUALLY WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY -- ON THE SANTA ROSA AND THE OTHER DISASTER RECOVERY IS IT'S NOT THE SEQUEL LIMITATION. IN FACT THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE FOR BUTTE COUNTY SAID IT THE PRIMARY PROBLEM IS LACK OF CONSTRUCTION LABOR. AND THE HIGH COST OF MATERIALS THAT'S WHAT'S SLOWING THINGS DOWN. IF THIS BILL HAD SOME OF IT ADDITIONS TO IT THAT SAID WE WANT TO SUPPORT MORE CONSTRUCTION TRAINING IT BUTTE COLLEGE OR AT YUBA COLLEGE OR SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THAT THEN IT MIGHT BRING SOMETHING. WORTHWHILE TO THE TABLE BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S OVER BROAD. IT'S EXTREME AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPROVED THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT OKAY LET'S HEAR FROM OTHER FOLKS WHO WANT TO RAISE OPPOSITION -- CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. YES PLEASE I'M GRACE MARVIN I'M REPRESENT FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THIS YEAR CLUB YA HE GROUP IN VIEW GLAND COLUSA TAME AND PART OF LASSEN COUNTY. AND WE FEEL AS WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS SIERRA CLUB NATIONAL POSITION. THAT WE WILL NOT WE DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THIS BILL UNLESS IT IS SERIOUSLY AMENDED. WE FEEL THAT FOR THIRTY DOESN'T GIVE ATTENTION TO THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF HOUSING PROJECTS INCLUDING EMERGENCY EVACUATION ROUTES.

AN INFILL DEVELOPMENT BRING PEOPLE CLOSER TOGETHER REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS VEHICLE EMISSIONS. AND WOOD CONSIDERATE PROTEST ADDUCTION AND WASTED RESOURCES IS REALLY KEY AND THIS BILL.

HI MY NAME IS SAM PONZIO AND ON BEHALF OF BUTTE COUNTY THREE FIFTY WE STRONGLY OPPOSE A MINUTE JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT PER MINUTE BUT ISSUE REGARDING THE PRECEDENT THAT COULD BE.

MORE OF A NEUTRAL TRAINER BUT MORE COMMON SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA'S HERE CLUB WORKED WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE STAFF PROTECTIONS ADDED TO THE BILL AND LIKE SOME A MEMBER GALLAGHER SAID WE ARE CURRENTLY NEW TROT THIS TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LOTS HERE THERE'S A LOT HERE LET ME LET ME -- FIRST ASK THE AUTHOR -- I HEARD YOU ACCEPT. THE A MAN'S D. E. N. F. NOW IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- YOUR STAFF FOR WAS IN TOUCH WITH OUR OFFICE -- AND THE THE CHEAP EXPRESS YOUR AGREEMENT. TO SIX UNITS IN ACRE AND THEN FURTHER DISCUSSION ON V. M. T.. IS THAT NOT THE CASE -- WE'VE BEEN HAVING DISCUSSIONS THIS MORNING RIGHT KIND OF GOING BACK AND FORTH A LOT OF THAT WAS ABOUT TRYING TO REACH KIND OF A GLOBAL. ON THESE THREE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE NOT AGREEING -- TO WE'RE NOT THERE YET I'M CERTAINLY COMMITTEE KEEP TALKING IF WE CAN MOVE THIS BILL FOR TODAY -- BUT YOU KNOW THAT. WHAT WAS BEING REQUESTED WAS? OF THE ANTI REQUIREMENT AND THE AND THE SIX BILLION PER ACRE DENSITY. A REQUIREMENT AND AS I CAN GET INTO V. AN T. IN MY AREA RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO DATA. AVAILABLE FOR SOMEONE TO COMPARE TO WHAT THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED FRIG FRANCES AND I HAVE EMAILS. YOU KNOW FROM ALL THE COUNTIES THAT I CHECKED IN WITH -- FROM BUTTE AND TAME AND SUTTER -- STARTERS COVER BY SAY BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE SOME DATA -- BUT BUTTE AND TO HIM -- WOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO COMPLY WITH. THE V. AN T. REQUIREMENT AS AS AND I WOULD FURTHER NOTE THAT UNDER THE NEW SEQUEL RULES FOR ANY SECRET DOCUMENTS GOING FOR THAT THAT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT TILL TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS IS JUST A VERY NEW. REQUIREMENT THAT YOU KNOW THESE RURAL AREAS WOULD HAVE A VERY HARD TIME. THE OMMITTEE SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE DATA FOR AND THAT WE WOULD KNOW HOW TO REPLY WITH RIGHT YEAH -- BUT ARE YOU ALSO I THINK -- MEETING WITH YOU YOU AGREE -- TO LIKE A PERCENTAGE CAP I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAX OF 10% [inaudible] PER CITY. IN GROWTH THAT WOULD THEY WOULD. IN UNITS RIGHT -- I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSION ABOUT A CAP YOU KNOW WE'D WE YOU AND I BOTH TALKED ABOUT THAT -- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE COME TO AN EXACT NUMBER. YET -- AND THAT'S WHY I'M SAYINGI I HAVE A THING I WANT TO CONTINUE TO TO TALK ABOUT THAT -- INTEREST BECAUSE THAT THAT DISCUSSION WAS PART OF CAN A A GLOBAL AGREEMENT ON THESE THREE AMENDMENTS THAT THAT I'M NOT AGREEING TO THEIR IN THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW RIGHT -- OKAY AND I DON'T KNOW WITHOUT HAVING LIKE ALL THOSE DETAILS IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY YOU KNOW. I GUESS WHAT I AM AT WHAT ASK YOU ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE PART OF THIS. LET ME LET ME INCLUDES A LET ME JUST SERVICE ARE JUST THE I MEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE ROOM -- WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN IN PRETTY INTENSE DISCUSSIONS ON THIS I MEAN I THINK. I THINK THE COMMITTEE'S PERSPECTIVE IS ALWAYS BAND -- OBVIOUSLY VERY SYMPATHETIC FOR THE BROADER A CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH. DISPLACEMENT FROM THE PARADISE FIRE -- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF COURSE IS. I WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT CITIES IN THE MIXERS ALSO QUESTION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY INDIVIDUAL CITY HAS A DIRECT NEXUS. I OR OR OR MORE DIRECT NEXUS TO THE FIRE THE MOST. DIRECTOR OF ALL THE CITIES IS TO GO THAT'S WHERE THIS GRAND THE GREATEST DISPLACEMENT FROM THE FIRING OF COURSE IS THE ONE CITY THAT'S ASKED TO BE. KEPT OUT OF THE BILL BECAUSE THEY ASKED TO RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I AND YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM VOICES FROM FOLKS FROM CHICO HERE TODAY ON BOTH SIDES YOU KNOW -- I I UNDERSTAND THAT [inaudible] I THAT'S ONE ISSUE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF THE BROADER CHALLENGE OF THIS COMMITTEE ANYTHING SEEN AS A GUARDINO SYKORA -- WE DID HAVE A JOINT HEARING -- WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IT SEVERAL OF YOU ATTENDED -- YEAH AND AND THE CARD THE GIST OF THAT HEARING. AND THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF ARGUMENT ON BOTH SIDES IS THAT -- YEAH THAT SECRET BEING USED AS A YOU KNOW AS A JUSTIFICATION -- FOR BASICALLY THE ARE THE ARGUMENT THE CORE ARGUMENT ABOUT HEARING AS YOU ALL RECALL WAS THAT -- WAS THAT. IT'S IT'S IT'S MISPLACED TO PUT THE BLAME FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS ON SEAQUEST [inaudible] I'M. NOW YEAH THEY'RE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THAT -- THERE ALSO YOU KNOW LOTS OF HOUSING CHALLENGES UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND WE GOT ALMOST AS CRISIS AND ARE ALL OVER THE STATE CERTAINLY IN OUR CITIES WE HAD A BIG FIRE IN SANTA ROSA. CAME UP BY UNDERSTAND AS A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE BUT BUT CERTAINLY -- EQUALLY SYMPATHETIC AND DIFFICULT -- AND SO I THINK PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH IS -- AND AND AND AND AND YOU KNOW I'M VERY COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THE BILL FLEW OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY -- DID NOT HAVE THE OPPOSITION IS SIERRA CLUB AND OTHER GROUPS TO HAVE TYPICALLY OPPOSE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ANY CHANGES EQUAL I MEAN THERE IS A BILL. THAT -- YOU KNOW WHAT IF. BASICALLY PUT A A BAD FAITH. STAND ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES -- ON THE SENATE SIDE AND YOU KNOW AND THERE'S A BILL THE BASICALLY. I'M CAUGHT A FILE EXISTING LANGUAGE -- TO TO DISSUADE BAD FAITH FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AND AND SIERRA CLUB POSE THAT. ASSOCIATED WITH THE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> YET HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A BLANKET EXEMPTION FOR ALL OF THE CITY'S -- THAT SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; THAT&lt;/c&gt;</u> THAT SIERRA CLUB STILL CV AND A LOT OF THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OF TYPICALLY OPPOSE ANY CHANGES THE SEA QUEST -- ARE HAVE NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON SO THAT CAN YOU KNOW I I GET THAT AND I THINK IT'S I THINK IT IS I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO THE UNIQUE. SYMPATHETIC CASE OF THE THE AND PRACTICE ON THE GROUND ASSOCIATE WITH THE FIRE I I UNDERSTAND THAT -- SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH HERE IS. HOW DO WE? YOU KNOW I'M HOW DO WE YOU TAKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE FIRE WHICH WAS WHICH WAS A HORRIFIC AND AND AND WE'RE ALL PRAYING AT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BECOME THE NEW NORMAL BUT I I I KNOW BUT BUT WE CERTAINLY NOT TERRIBLE FIRES IN THE PAST THOUGH. NEVER WE HAD AN ENTIRE CITY JUST BURN TO THE GROUND IN THE WAY WE SAW WITH PARADISE. AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED AND SYMPATHETIC TO TO THE WORK YOU'RE DOING WITH ALL OF YOUR LOCAL FOLKS ON TRYING. TO ADDRESS THE DISPLACEMENT ISSUES THERE [inaudible] I WE'VE ENGAGE AS YOU KNOW AND I'M IN AND LOST HIM TRIED OUT DISCUSSION ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE SO THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO GRANT AN EXEMPTION SO CITY SECRET HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT -- YOU KNOW HOW. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT -- HELPING TO PROMULGATE OR ENCOURAGE. PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE NOT IN LINE WITH A LOT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE BEING EMPLOYED UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND THAT'S I THINK AT THE HEART OF A LOT OF THE THE ASKS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE HERE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT SIMPLY. CONTRIBUTING TO SPRAWL. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TYPICALLY DONE IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILLS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. THAT HAVE BEEN OPPOSED AS I SAY BY ALL THESE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THAT WE STILL PASSED OUT OF THE COMMITTEE THAT'S BECAUSE WE DEMANDED A WHOLE SLEW OF OF OF MITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. ON THINGS LIKE LEGAL WHICH IS NOW IN THIS BILL THAT'S AND THAT'S AN EXCELLENT THING I'LL BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE. YOU KNOW -- ZERO NET ENERGY -- VMT REQUIREMENTS -- YOU KNOW OTHER SORTS OF REQUIREMENTS THAT DIRECTLY RELATE TO A KIND OF REALLY ENVIRONMENTAL BEST PRACTICES IN ALL OF THOSE BILLS RELATED DIRECTLY -- TO TO ASPECTS OF THE HOUSING CRISIS AND AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES THAT. AND BY THE WAY THOSE BY THE WAY WERE OWN WE'RE WE'RE ONLY JUDICIAL EXPEDITED REVIEW AS OPPOSED TO A STRAIGHT UP EXEMPTION ALTOGETHER -- SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE HERE I THINK I THINK THAT'S WHAT WORK WERE KIND OF GRAPPLING WITH I GUESS -- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW YOU MAY VERY WELL HAVE -- THE VOTES TO GET THIS OUT JUST AS IT IS -- I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW ON I AM. YOU KNOW I I I I IE IF YOU WELL. I SUPPOSE. WHAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT ME? IN ADDITION TO D. E. AND F. WHICH YOU AGREE TO FOR NOT GOING TO GO WITH A B. AND C. I AM. I WOULD WANT TO KIND OF GO BACK TO WHAT I AT LEAST THOUGHT WAS SOME OF THE CORE PRINCIPLES THAT WE AGREED ON IN ARE CLOSED OR CONVERSATIONS. SIXTEEN IT'S AN ACRE. I'M AND THEN [inaudible] A CAP. RIGHT TO THE THAT WE WE MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T JUST BECOME AN ABSOLUTE RAMPANT -- GROWTH. BEYOND BEYOND THE SCOPE THAT I THINK ANY OF US THINK IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN. AND I REAL ROBUST FOR THE DISCUSSION AND YET BE ANTI AND WITH WITH US FOR A WHOLE WITH HOLDING A RITE. OF BRINGING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IF WE'RE NOT ABLE. TO ADDRESS THE V. M. T. ISSUES -- THAT THE THERE WE HAVE. AND YOU KNOW WITH OUR COMMITTEE COMMITTING TO A GOOD FAITH DISCUSSION -- WITH TRYING TO GET TO YES ON ON SOMETHING IT'S MEANINGFUL I THINK. THEREFORE GONNA GRANT A SECRET ACTION ON THIS THE ANTI ISSUE I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT US BECAUSE IT REALLY SPEAKS TO YOU --% MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOUBLING DOWN ON BAD PLANNING PRACTICES. NOW AS I SAY IF IF THE VOTES ARE THERE FOR YOU TO GET THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE. ARE WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF COMMITMENTS. YOU KNOW YOU'RE VERY WELCOME. TO ODD TO TO TO GO THAT DIRECTION AND I'M I CERTAINLY WON'T BE OFFENDED I MEAN I I I THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND AND I THINK YOU GET WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND IT'S A TOUGH BALANCE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE HERE -- BUT IF NOT ARE YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY CAN COMMITTEE YOU. TO A REALLY GOOD FAITH DISCUSSION ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE JUST THAT I JUST OUTLINED. AND TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE REALLY CAN ALL FEEL COMFORTABLE -- AND AND I THINK WE DON'T HAVE TO OF COURSE BRING ALL THE OTHER NUMBERS INTO THAT DISCUSSION BASED ON WHERE EVERYONE IS TODAY. SO AS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WOULD. WHATEVERWE WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE FOR IT WOULD REALLY BE IN ACCORD WITH AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE'S WISHES. SO THAT'S WHERE I AM. BUT I CERTAINLY WANT TO HEAR FROM MY OTHER COLLEAGUES -- THIS IS A TOUGH TOUGH BILL A TOUGH ISSUE TOUGH YEAH CHALLENGE YOU'RE FACING IN YOUR REGION -- I THINK IT I WILL SAY TO ALL THE ADVOCATES HERE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE THE YOU REALLY DO HAVE A DOG -- AND COMMITTED ADVOCATE IN IN IN THE IN THE CELL NUMBER I MEAN REALLY DOES CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT. ABOUT HIS DISTRICT ABOUT THESE COMMUNITIES IN ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE AND YOU KNOW I ADMIRE YOUR TENACITY IN SPIRIT. AND A COMMITMENT TO TO TO DOING RIGHT BY YOUR BY YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHICH WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU REALLY ARE DOING RIGHT. BY THESE TOWNS -- AND AND THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING. pTHERE REALLY ARE THERE THERE REALLY IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION IT REALLY IS AN OFFSET. AT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING RIGHT BY -- THESE COMMUNITIES ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE SO I WITHOUT A LOVE TO OPEN THE FLOOR TO DISCUSSION AND CENTER HEALTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND THANKS FOR THE DISCUSSION I APOLOGIZE IT DID NOT HEAR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OPENING COMMENTS BUT I DID HEAR A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY I A OF AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND DIRECTIONS AYE AYE WILLING FRANKLY TO MOVE THE BILL. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS. THE AMENDMENTS THAT HE'S TAKEN BUT I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN AND THE ISSUE AND I DID HEAR FROM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT HE'S WILLING. TO CONTINUE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU WHAT IT WHAT IS IT WILL GO FROM HERE. ELEMENTS FINANCE OF INCH WELL OKAY SO I MEAN THERE IS TIME TO DO THAT THERE IS TO IT HEARD AND THAT I FREE AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT. ASPECT OF IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IS I'VE READ THROUGH THIS IN AS I VISITED PARADISE AND I WENT THROUGH THOSE TOWNS THE IN THE AREA AND SAW THEM I I I GUESS I'M KIND OF STRUCK WITH THE DEVASTATION THAT I SAW THE CHALLENGES THAT THE RESIDENTS ARE FACING NOW. LIVING IN CHICO AND THE OTHER CITIES. IN IN CONDITIONS THAT ARE -- ARE CHALLENGING HAVE NOTHING ELSE I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY DESPERATE. AND AS I HEARD THE OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THIS WELL AS THE AMPLIFIERS WERE UNPRECEDENTED. AND THEY LEFT COMMUNITIES YEAH I'M IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE COMPLETELY DESTROYED. AND HOW CAN WE NOT LOOK AT TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION WHEN. IT. THE ISSUE OF TAKING. SAY GOING TO GRIDLEY OR BIGGER SUMMIT OR ORVILLE. AND ALLOWING THIS I'VE UNDERSTAND IN THE FEMA. TRAILERS ARE GOING TO BE BUILT IN WHICH CITY OF MASTIC. GRIDLEY AND HOW MANY OF THEM DO WE HAVE. FOR FOUR HUNDRED UNIT HUNDRED UNITS ARE BEING BUILDING GREATLY RIGHT NOW OF TRAILERS THAT WILL BE THERE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND WHEN THOSE EXPIRE AND AND WHEN THEY'RE GONE THEY'RE GONE THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE WITHOUT HOME. AND I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT HOMELESS AGAIN -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO IS THE FEAR OF SPRAWL TO ME I THINK IS. IS -- I MEAN THIS SIX DISC SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX HOW MANY HOMES ARE WE GOING TO BUILD IN THAT LENGTH OF TIME. YOUR QUESTION IS NOT ENOUGH THAT WILL MAKE YOU KNOW CREATE THIS FOR ALL THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS I SEE IT -- THE A LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENTS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WITH A LOT OF A CREATURE AROUND THEM YEAH THE IDEA OF THEM MOVING INTO TRACK HOMES IS THIS NOT SOMETHING THAT I CAN SEE. AS A POSSIBILITY AND I LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE ON HERE AND AND TO ME. THE MOST VALUED ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION. IN CALIFORNIA IS A SIERRA CLUB. AND THEY'VE TAKEN A NEUTRAL POSITION BECAUSE THEY RESPECT THE WORK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE IN IN IDENTIFYING IN LAYING OUT THOSE CONDITIONS OF WHERE THIS BILL COULD WORK YEAH. SO I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AND SUPPORTED TO THAT THAT CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE NOW CAN GET TO A COMFORT SPOT FOR YOU IN THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU SHARE -- BUT I DO THINK THAT BY NOT MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD WE'RE LEAVING AND DESERT IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN. BEEN. DEVASTATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR IF IF. YOU KNOW WITHOUT INITIAL EVEN YOU KNOW IF IF IF IF IT TURNS OUT A MAJORITY THE COMMITTEE IS COMFORTABLE WITH. THE BILL AS IT IS AND AND YOU KNOW A WITH WITH YOU KNOW WITH IMMENSELY HE'S AGREED. TO AND I'M NOT GONNA BUT IF I COULD JUST ADD O THAT I AGREE WITH YOU MISTER MISTER CHAIR BUT I THINK. KNOWING THE AUTHORS I DO HE'D WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AFTER THE FACT ANYHOW IT BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL GO TO THE FLOOR. AND AND HE WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING ABSOLUTELY THE THE CHALLENGES BàN [inaudible] OUR I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY AS AS ANY TO DO WITH THE WITH THE THE GOOD FAITH OF THE AUTHOR I THINK THE CHALLENGES SPEND JUST -- SOME DISAGREE JUST KIND OF CORE DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT -- ABOUT. THE ROLE OF SEA QUEST I AM NINE NINE AND AND AND I THINK WE SHARE THOSE VALUES YEAH YEAH. OKAY -- YES I REQUEST YOU KNOW I GOT THAT. OKAY -- TO LET ME LET ME ASK YOU ONE OTHER QUESTION BY THE WAY YEAH. YOU MENTIONED THE DOLLARS HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN CITY LIMITS IMMEDIATE. I'VE I'VE GOTTEN REALLY INTO THE GENERAL PLANS OF ALL THE CITY'S INVOLVED A WONDERFUL. I ALSO ENVY THE COLOR PRINTING WHICH WE DON'T GET IN OUR OFFICES -- I PROVIDED TO THE AYE FOR YOU THAT I'M A GREAT FAN YEAH PROBABLY REPORTABLE GIFT -- NOW LET ME ASK YOU YOU YOU WERE SAYING THAT EVERY HAS TO BE WITHIN THIS THAT THE CITY LIMITS. THERE AT LEAST IN PLACES LIKE YUBA CITY BUT ALSO ELSEWHERE THERE'S AN INTERESTING IDEA OF A SPHERE OF INFLUENCE I LOVE TO HAVE IN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE. OVER ON THE COMMITTEE YOU KNOW BUT BUT WHAT WHAT IS THAT WE'RE DECIDED TO PLAY WITH THE BILL AND CITY LIMITS VERSUS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE. SO BUSTER OF INFLUENCES COMMON YOU KNOW CITIES WILL HAVE A SPHERE OF INFLUENCE IS KIND OF LIKE WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE. TO POSSIBLY GO IN THE FUTURE BUT IT HASN'T BEEN ANNEXED. INTO THE CITY LIMITS OKAY SO UNDER THIS BILL IT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO BUILD. CARTE BLANCHE IN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE IT EITHER HAS TO BE IN THE CITY LIMITS. OR IT HAS TO BE A SPECIALLY PLANNED RESIDENTIAL AREA THAT CONTAINED IN THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN. NOW CAN YOU BE IN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE AND IN THE GENERAL PLAN. YES YOU CAN BE HOW DOES THAT WORK IN IN INTERACTION WITH THE THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT. WELL YOU HAVE TO GO TO A LAUGH CO PROCESS TO ANNEX THAT PROPERTY INTO THE CITY LIMITS. OKAY SO AT THAT POINT. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDED TO THE CITY LIMITS TO BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY ENJOY THE RIGHT WELL I MEAN IF THEY'VE HAD IF THEY'VE PLANTED IN THEIR GENERAL PLAN AS A SPECIALIZED RESIDENTIAL ZONE. THAT'S WHAT THE LANGUAGE SAYS THEN THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE RIGHT -- BUT I MEAN YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH ALL THOSE DIFFERENT GENERAL PLANS FOR EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE BIGGS. HAS. WE OWE IT SPHERE OF INFLUENCE RIGHT BUT MUCH OF THAT LAND IS ZONED AGRICULTURAL. IN THE GENERAL PLAN AND THEN IT HAS. AN AREA WHERE THAT IS SORT OF HAS AN AG BUFFER IF YOU WILL AND A LOT OF CITIES HAVE THIS -- IN MY AREA ANYWAY. WHICH UP WHEN I WAS BUT WE WERE WHAT ARE YOUR LIKE THE POSTER CHILD FOR NOT SPRAWLING AND IN MY AREA BUT IN BUT -- NO IN THESE GENERAL PLANS LIKE THEY OFTEN WILL HAVE THAT AG BUFFER SO THEY DON'T TAKE UP THEY DON'T GO ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE POTENTIAL SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THEY JUST PLAN CERTAIN AREAS THAT MAKES SENSE. YEAH -- NEXT TO IT EXISTING DEVELOPMENT OF THIS IS THIS IS WHY I LOVE THIS JOB BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. AG BUFFERS IN TORRANCE IN SANTA MONICA SO -- YEAH I'M LEARNING A LOT HERE SO -- THE SENATE DOLLY. MR CARED. THANK YOU. FOR DOING THE GOOD WORK YOU'RE DOING AYE. I'M A CO AUTHOR ON THE BILL. I'D LIKE TO COMMITTEE TO KNOW THAT I LOST. ELEVEN THOUSAND MY CONSTITUENTS IN MIGUEL YEAH. WERE AFFECTED BY THIS FIRE AND SO. THIS IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AND I ALSO SERVE MANY YEARS JUST LIKE A SIMILAR GALLAGHER YOU'RE DEAD ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND DID DEALT WITH -- LAUGHTER CQ A LAUGH GO OPEN SPACE. ALL THE THINGS THAT ALMOST ONE AM DROP HECKSCHER FOR YOU FOR THOSE MEMBERS WHO DON'T HAVE VAST AMOUNTS OF OPEN SPACE IN YOUR COUNTIES OR CITIES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS IN BUTTE COUNTY BUT I CAN TELL YOU IN MY COUNTY WHERE I COME FROM. 65% OF THE COUNTY IS OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WILL NEVER BE DEVELOPED AND I WILL GUARANTEE THAT THERE'S A GOOD PART OF BUTTE. AND THESE OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE ZONED ACT WHICH ARE. LOTS HAVE CONSERVATION IS ON WILL NEVER BE DEVELOPED AND SO WE TALK ABOUT SPRAWL YOU TALK ABOUT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. IN THESE ARE RULE COMMUNITIES WERE. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT. MOST PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN WE GO TO DO DEVELOPMENT IN. URBAN AREAS AND SO I ALSO WANT. TO CURRENTLY THAT OUT HERE. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A CARP LAUNCH SEQUEL EXEMPTION HE'S TAKEN ALL KINDS OF AMENDMENTS TO NARROW THIS THING DOWN. TO TAKE CARE OF THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOMES. THAT. WERE DESTROYED IN ONE DAY. SO. AND I HAVE I'VE MET WITH THESE PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW YEAH THEY MIGHT NOT BE THERE YOUR NUMBERS MIGHT NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO COME BACK THERE DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ROOTS IN THAT COMMUNITY I BEG TO DIFFER I'VE I HAVE A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO. ARE IN REDDING I I REPRESENT READING AND HAD A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO WERE MIGUEL YOU ARE IN READING RIGHT NOW. SO WE'VE TOGETHER THE TWO OF US HAVE TRIED TO DIVIDE UP THE PIECES LEGISLATION. I WORKED ON A SOLAR EXEMPTION. FOR AND WHICH WAS IN FRONT OF THIS -- ENERGY COMMITTEE SORRY. AND WE'VE NARROWED THESE THINGS DOWN I HAVE OPPOSITION FROM ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ON MOST. OF MY LEGISLATION I WORK ON WHEN IT COMES TO NATURAL RESOURCES. WE WERE MY POINT IS IS THAT I THINK THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF BEING REALISTIC HERE AND COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO THIS. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AND ALSO LIKE. TO POINT OUT THAT [inaudible] SOME. THE NEED TO VISIT THE COMMUNITY IF YOU HAVE AND I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN THERE AND SO WE DO WE DO TO SEE WHAT EXEMPTIONS. WE DON'T FOR THE KINGS ARENA WE DO IT. FOR DAYS ARENA WHEN THERE'S A LOTTA. WEALTH IN LOT OF POLITICAL JUICE THAT COMES IN AND TESTIFIES IT. AND THE SEEMS TO GET DONE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COMMUNITY OF REALLY POOR PEOPLE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY ORVILLE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DAMAGE IN OUR AREA AND SO I THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH. TO GETTING TO WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO GO. THE SPHERES OF INFLUENCE ARE GOING TO BE BUILT IN UNLESS THERE IS A PLAN DEVELOPMENT AT ARI'S BEEN. RATIFIED BY THE LOCAL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR THE CITY. HAS BEEN THROUGH A GENERAL PLAN. IT'S YOUR PARTY OR GENERAL PLAN SO -- I'M GLAD THAT WE I THINK THIS BILL WILL GET OUT HERE TODAY WITHOUT TAKING MEMBERS I AND I'VE BEEN HERE WHERE YOU'RE AT ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHERE YEAR. IF YOU TAKE ALL THE MINUTES YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET WHERE YOU WANT TO GO SO WHAT'S THAT WHAT THE HECK YOU YOU LOSE EITHER WAY AND I AND I THINK THERE IS MAYBE SOME ROOM VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IS. IT'S NOT THE SAME AS WHERE YOU HAVE MASS TRANSIT WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THESE KIND OF THINGS. THIS IS NOT THERE SENATE LIVING PLEASE CAR FIVE TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL ON THE ARENA'S DID NOT GET AN EXEMPTION RIGHT THEY GOT EXPEDITED REVIEW SO THEY STILL HAD TO PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND IT WAS REJECTED BY THE AUTHOR. ON THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED ME CLARIFY THAT AS WELL. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT -- VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED -- ET IN IT IN COMPARISON WITH URBAN AREAS OR SUBURBAN AREAS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SO THE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW IT HOW THE VEHICLE MUST TRAVEL IN A RELEASE WITH THIS AREA. SO THAT COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE -- SO CITY WE DID DID THE THE PROJECTS WOULD ONLY BE COMPARED TO THE TO TO TO THE TO THE EXISTING. VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED PATTERNS. OF THAT COUNTY OF THAT REGION. SO THAT. GOES TO MAKE IT TO TOAST TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS ROUGHLY RIGHT RURAL AREAS HAVE HIGHER VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THERE LONGER COMMUTES NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. SO I JUST A I I HEAR YOU AND I I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THOSE TWO THINGS ARE CLARIFIED WELL THE MINUTE WAS TO REQUIRED TO BE 15% BELOW THE REGIONAL AVERAGE WHICH IF YOU'RE REGIONAL AVERAGE NOT CITY RIGHT BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REGION ADDRESS. AVERAGES AND WHEN WE DO WE DO. I ONLY TRANSPORTATION AGENCY THAT HAS DONE -- IS SAY COX'S SAY CAUGHT DOES ENCOMPASS SUTTER COUNTY WHICH WOULD INCLUDE BE THE CITY IN LIVE OAK -- BE CAG WHICH IS A PLAN AGES THE COVERS BUTTE COUNTY WHERE MOST OF THE CITIES ARE AND TO HIM A COUNTY WERE CORNING IS. DOES NOT. HAVE THAT DATA YET SO THERE'D. EACH COULD DO AN ANALYSIS PERHAPS ON WHAT YOUR VEHICLE MILES ARE GOING TO BE BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO CAUSE A REGIONAL THE ANTI HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED YET. IN. YEAH I KNOW THAT'S NOT CAR BELONG SEEK WAS. YOURS DURING THE SEASON THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF THIS BUILDING NOW DOWN A LOT OF THE TIME TO GET. TO THE PLACE WHERE HE'S OUT WHERE WE HAVE. MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS GOING NEUTRAL AND I THINK I CAN I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL. AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S ALL SEQUEL. THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY WE HAVE. PROBLEMS WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA AND I THINK SEEK WORK IN IS A PIECE OF IT BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH WE WE KNOW. WE ADDRESS THAT BUT WE HAVE HOUSING PRICES WE HAVE DISPLACED PEOPLE. THAT ARE WANTING TO COME BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITY AND IT IS WAS A DEVASTATING. THE FIRE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THIS BILL PASSED AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR ND WE CAN BUILD SOME HOMES FOR THOSE FOLKS. AND LITTLE IN LEGAL THIS YOU SAY IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AS ONE ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS WE MADE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH THE BILLS THAT WE LET -- THIS COMMITTEE -- SO I AM NOT A MASTER. A VERY QUICKLY -- AS TIME GOES I THINK WE'VE AID MOST EXCEPT I JUST WANNA MAKE UP. A COMPARISON MY CONCERN IS CERTAINLY SPRAWL BUT IT'S CERTAINLY DENSIFICATION AND THEY AMENDMENT THAT WAS SUGGESTING HERE IS A HUGE DENSIFICATION OF AREAS THAT ARE VERY RURAL IN NATURE. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE SEEKING BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER DID WHEN HE PUT. FORTH TAUGHT WHAT HE WOULDLIKE TO SEE IN TERMS OF THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ACRE SAND THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS PER ACRE. WHAT'S IN HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- TWO HUNDRED UNITS ON A TEN ACRE PLOT I MEAN THAT GIVES YOU OUT ONE TAMPA NACRE THESE ARE THESE OF THE STAFF IS STACKED FLAT SMALL TOLD FAMILY. AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF A VERY OFTEN I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S LOOKING. FOR A IN THE MANNER IN WHICH HE'S APPROACH THERE SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PASS ADELPHIA'S AND HAVE HIM CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THAT FILL. YOUR RELATING YOU'RE RELIEVING THE CONCERNS ABOUT SPRAWL BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE PROVIDING THE KIND A HABITAT. THAT REALLY FOSTERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AS COMPARED TO OUR WORK FORCE AND THAT'S REALLY GOOD PLANNING AND I THINK HE'S BUILT FROM. WHICH SEEK WHICH TRIES TO DO AND I THINK IN A RATHER ARCHAIC WAY FRANKLY A WE SHOULD LET THE PLANNER SANDY AND THE CITY. AND THERE'S OWNING AND THEIR SUB THERE -- SUBDIVISION MAP TRACKS ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE FOR EONS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW GREAT COMMUNITIES DOES NEED TO BE AMENDED I AS TIMES CHANGE BUT NOT TO THE DRAMATIC THE THAT'S BEING PRESENTED HERE IN THE MEMO SO I THINK YOU GUYS ARE WORKING. ON IT HI I'M TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE. OF WHAT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER IS DOING AND CERTAINLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS CHAIRMAN TO TRY. TO YOU KNOW KIND OF TIGHT END UP FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE SO. I'LL LET. CALL THE QUESTION OKAY. OKAY. SEE THAT MAN OF AYE SIR -- DOES IT FROM MARKHAM JUST FOR FOLKS TO KNOW FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS LOW PR. I'M ON THIS UNITY ISSUE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THEY JUST NEED TO HAVE A A MODEL RUN THE CAR CAN DO IT A TRANSPORTATION CONSULTING CAN DO IS GUIDE AS MAP SHOWING EXISTING. LOCATIONS A QUALIFY NOT BASED ON THE PROJECT AND THEY DON'T HAVE A MAP AND THEY CAN RUN A MODEL SO THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT AND WE CAN WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION. ON THE OTHER THING BY THE WAY -- THIS PROFESSOR THAT I WAS REFERRING -- TO YOU COULD YOU CAN IF ANY OF I KNOW A LOT OF CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS HERE -- YOU CAN WALK YOU THROUGH YOUR OPTIONS IN TERMS OF ZONING AND BY RIGHT IN. THE CENTER PLAY WAS HE WAS A GENTLEMAN NAMED KENNETH STALL AS T. . H. L. HE'S PROFESSOR CHAPMAN LAW SCHOOL AND YOU CAN LOOK THEM UP ONLINE. AND HIS NUMBERS THERE YET SHE PICKS UP THE CLIP THE CALLS AND BUT IS IT IS AN INTERESTING PERSON TO TALK TO YOU IF YOU'RE RUNNING INTO -- IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE THE INTERESTING INTERPLAY BETWEEN ZONING IN AND BY RIGHT IN SECRET EXEMPTIONS -- OR OR JUST AVOIDING SEAQUEST THROUGH -- FOR FOR FOR FOR PROJECTS AND IN DOING IT WITHIN THE THE CURRENT LEGAL STRUCTURE -- CENTER CASKET. I COULDN'T CONTROL MYSELF MISTER CHAIRMAN. THIS IS REALLY HARD IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE SUGGEST. THE MAN REQUIRE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT [inaudible] ANYTHING [inaudible] OF NO. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE DENSER DEVELOPMENT IN ANY OF THE SIX CITIES ARE EIGHT CITIES THAT YOU HAVE. IT WOULD REQUIRED. DENSER DEVELOPMENT ALTHOUGH IT DOES HAVE A MINIMUM DENSITY AFFORDABLE AND UNITS PER ACRE. AND IT HAS A MAXIMUM ACREAGE OF FIFTY ACRES [inaudible] NOTWITHSTANDING THE LEAVES CERTIFICATION WHICH WOULD PRECLUDE THE CITY FROM APPROVING BY MINISTERIAL APPROVAL. MORE DENSER DEVELOPMENTS IN THAT AT ALL. AND THAT WOULD HAPPEN THAT WOULD HAPPEN AT THE ONE PUBLIC HEARING THAT IS NOW REQUIRED THE IMAGE THAT AMENDMENT DE THAT YOU'RE TAKING -- WELL THAT'S ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT I'M TAKING TODAY YES -- BUT THAT THAT CONSIDERATION WOULD BE AT THAT ONE HEARING NO THAT WOULD I MEAN IT'S IN THE BILL. THERE HAS TO BE A AT LEAST FOR DWELLING UNITS PER ACRE OKAY [inaudible] I'M. OTHER THAN THE LEAN CERTIFICATION IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE BILL THAT REQUIRES BETTER HOUSING. WHAT'S NEW BUT IS THERE ANYTHING REQUIRES BETTER HOUSING BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF CRITERIA -- WELL EVERYTHING THAT WOULD BE BUILT UNDER THIS BILL IS BEING BUILT TO THE MODERN -- CODE WHICH INCLUDES A GREEN BUILDING CODES -- EVERYTHING IN THAT WOULD BE APPROVED UNDER THIS -- COULD NOT BE BILL TOM ON WETLANDS -- IT COULD NOT BE BUILT ON ANYTHING THAT AFFECTED HABITAT -- COULD NOT BE BUILT A IN IN AREAS THAT WOULD BE. CONSIDERED. THERE ARE DANGERS POSED BY FLOODING OR WILD FIRE HAZARD -- SO. I WOULD SAY IN ALL AS RESPECTS IT IT. IT INCENTIVIZE IS. GOOD AND RESPONSIBLE HOUSING GROWTH NOW IT HAS TO BE IN THE CITY LIMITS LIKE SO IT CAN'T GO UNDER THE UNINCORPORATED PARTS. OF THE COUNTY. YEAH I THINK WE HAD TALKED ABOUT -- YOU KNOW I THINK THEIR TESTS FIND AT THE CITY'S HADN'T DONE ANYTHING TO START WORKING ON AMENDMENTS SITTERS SPECIFIC PLAN TO GENERAL PLANS OR ANY OF THESE OTHER TOOLS WELL THEY ALL HAVE GENERAL PLANS BY AND THEY HAD AND SOME OF THEM HAVE SPECIFIC PLANS. FOR HOUSING PROJECTS WE WE HAD WE HAD LAST YEAR WE HAD MISTER AT SOME NUMBER WOULD HAD A BILL FROM SANTA ROSA THAT. TALKED ABOUT -- X. EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW BUT THEY HAD A YOU KNOW THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AMENDMENTS TO THEIR DOWNTOWN STATION AREA PLAN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AMENDMENTS TO THE RED ZONE AREA THAT THEY HAD THEY HAD SPECIFIC PLANS. IN THIS WITHIN THE CITY ALREADY THAT THEY WANTED. TO EXPEDITE DE ARE PLANNING PROCESS IN THE END IN ORDER TO CREATE MORE DENSITY TO CREATE MORE HOUSING IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT HAS ANYTHING SIMILAR TO THAT. SO WE'VE DONE THE SAME THING IN A DIFFERENT WAY OKAY. SENATOR DOLLY CENTER NIELSEN AND I SINCE DAY ONE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS COMMUNITY GROUPS NON PROFITS -- AND WE HAVE A PACKAGE THE LEGISLATION OF WHICH THIS IS ONE BILL. I HAVE WORKED WITH THAT'S WHY EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S AFFECTED BY THIS BILL SUPPORTS THIS BILL THAT. AND WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT THEIR GENERAL PLANS AS WELL I PROVIDED -- THE CHAIRMAN WITH. EVERY SINGLE GENERAL PLANETS AFFECTED BY THESE -- BECAUSE WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS AND SAID HEY HERE'S WHERE WE'VE PLAN FOR GROWTH. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF WHERE WE HAVE ALREADY PLAN FOR GROWTH IN TRYING TO EXPEDITE HOUSING. IN AREAS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY APPROVED -- IN ALL THESE LOW AND THAT'S WHY ALL THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOLKS GOT UP HERE I HAVE I HAVE WORK SO CLOSELY. WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS THAT I'VE TAKEN A CITY OUT THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE. THAT'S HOW COOPERATIVE I'VE BEEN FROM DAY -- ONE SO TO ANYBODY'S POINT THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH THE LOCALS AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THIS IS COORDINATED AND PLANNED OUT. IT'S JUST NOT TRUE I MEAN THEY HAVEN'T BEEN. MORE OF ALL OF US HAVE BEEN THESE LAST EIGHT MONTHS. AND I WOULDN'T BE HERE THIS IF I HADN'T IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT RAY AND I DON'T THINK I'D THIS BILL PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE AT THIS STAGE -- IN IN THIS HOUSE IF I HADN'T DONE THAT RAY AND SO. I THINK ALL THAT SPEAKS TO THIS IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE COLLABORATIVE COOPERATIVE EFFORT CAN YOU CLARIFY FOR ME UNDER AMENDMENT HE IT REQUIRES YOU TO TALK -- TO GROUPS THAT IN THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY THAT MAY BE. ADVERSELY AFFECTED OR THAT THEY'RE NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED. YEAH THAT WAS A COMMITTEE AMENDMENT -- THAT PROPOSE THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TRAVEL GROUPS IN OUR REGION THAT. MEAL. MAY HAVE SOME ISSUE WITH THE PACIFIC BUT SPECIFIC SITE THAT IS BEING USED SO I MEAN WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT. HOW WOULD YOU AFFECT YOUR EFFECTUATE THAT WHAT WOULD BE? I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THERE IS A CULTURAL SIDE OR THERE'S SOME ISSUE BEYOND THAT'S COMMON THAT YOU IT IT WELL AS A COMMON THING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO IN A SEQUEL PROCESS RED. RIGHT YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY IT WE HAVE A BILL EARLIER THAT TODAY THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE ON THE MINISTERIAL. MOM. I AM TO WERE AGREEING TO DO THAT BECAUSE I AM BAD THINK GETS A THOUGHTFUL AMENDMENT AND LET'S SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT TODAY I JUST ONE I'M LOOKING FOR CLARIFICATION BECAUSE THE WHAT WHAT'S IN OUR PACKAGES THAT YOU JUST KIND OF WORK. TALK WITH THEM AND WORK WITH THEM TO THAT THEY'RE NOT ADVERSE EFFECT BUT I WANT. TO GET SOME SPECIFICS OF HOW YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE THAT. NOT MY BALL I THINK IT WOULD JUST BE A CONSOLE LIKE YOU WOULD NORMALLY DO A TRAVEL GOVERNMENT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. YEAH BECAUSE UNDER SEEK BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A HEARING AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO WEIGH IN ON WHAT THE AT AFFECT IS UNDER MEREST MINISTERIAL. APPROVAL YOU DON'T HAVE THAT I READ SOME CONCERNS AND THE LAST BILL OF THAT THE DEFICIENCIES ON THESE CALLS ARE CULTURAL SITES SOME. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING AS FOR THAT'S ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT WE'VE AGREED TO THERE WILL ALSO BE OTHER PUBLIC HEARINGS AS THE CITY MANAGER FOR MORE BILL TALKED ABOUT ANY TEN THE U. DO A SUBDIVISION -- BEEN A A DEVELOPMENT THERE'S GOING TO BE. PLANNING COMMISSION OTHER HEARINGS IT IS A MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS WHICH I WOULD POINT OUT THIS COMMITTEE HAS PASSED IT SB. THIRTY FIVE MEN AND SB -- THIRTY FIVE YELLOW. WAS LARGELY MORE FOCUSED ON AN URBAN AREA AND PROVIDE A MINISTERIAL APPROVAL -- AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S FINE THIS IS MODELED AFTER SB. THIRTY FIVE THE AUTHOR OF THAT BILL SUPPORTS THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL -- AND IS MODELED OFF A THIRTY FIVE AND IS FOCUSED ON A RURAL AREA THAT'S BEEN AFFECTED BY DISASTERS VERY LIMITED. TO THIS REGION AND HAS A LOT OF THE SAME PROTECTIONS. YEAH I DON'T REMEMBER THAT SB THIRTY FIVE COMING THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE BUT BUT SO I WEBSITE INSIDE INCOME BUT I WAS IN NO ONE SB THIRTY FIVE ANYWAY. AND I'LL BE A NO ON THIS -- BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE WITH THE OPPOSITION THIS IS THIS IS A WHOLESALE -- DISREGARD FOR THE PUBLIC PROCESS THAT'S REQUIRED BY SEEK. AND I KNOW I KNOW PEOPLE MISS TAXI CLUB OF WHAT YOU DO IS YOU BRING IN THE PUBLIC SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND NOBODY IN ALL THESE COMMUNITIES IS GONNA KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON STUFF JUST IS GOING TO GET BUILT. AND IF THERE'S A SLOWDOWN THERE'S WAYS THAT THAT CITIES CAN -- ASSIST IF THEY ARE REALLY. INTERESTED IN BUILDING THESE NEW CITIES AND IT'S REALLY A PART OF THEIR GENERAL PLAN SO. MISTER CHAIR I AM A NO ONE THIS I WAS IN NO YESTERDAY AND HOUSING -- I THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE PRECEDENT TO BE TO BE SETTING AND I AM DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER AMENDMENTS ARE SUGGESTED IN OUR ANALYSIS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WOULD GET TO YES WITH THEM BUT I CERTAINLY CAN'T GET THE S. WITHOUT ALL THE ALL THE MEMBERS. THIRDLY IS FOUR POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A SON SENATE BILL AND IN ESSENCE NOT FOREVER. AND THAT EVERYONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAS DONE A GENERAL PLAN. AND IF YOU'VE EVER DONE A GENERAL PLAN IS NOT GOING TO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE YOUR ZONING AND SIXTY WELL HOWEVER LONG IT IS TELL THAT. IT TAKES IN MOST CASES TEN TO TWELVE YEARS TO GET A GENERAL PLAN. THROUGH THE PROCESS EVEN TO GENERAL PLANTS SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE WHOLESALE BLOW OUTS OF THESE COMMUNITIES AS HE IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOU'RE GONNA SEE WORK DEVELOPMENTS ARE EVEN PLAN TO GO. GO IN THESE COMMUNITIES OKAY [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] SO. WHAT DO YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO I MEAN I GUESS WHAT I -- WHAT WHAT WHAT I WHAT I WOULD SAY? BY THE WAY WE JUST GOT THE VMT NUMBERS FROM YOU COUNTY SO THEY ARE AVAILABLE. BUT OKAY SO SO IT'S SO YOU HAVE A CHOICE IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE I MEAN WE I APPRECIATE THE FACT YOU'VE ACCEPTED A MEN'S D. E. ENOUGH. I UNDERSTAND WE'RE STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH A B. AND C.. AND EVEN WITH THOSE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SURE THAT SOME OF OUR MEMBERS WOULD VOTE FOR IT -- SO YOU HAVE A CHOICE AND IT KIND OF DEPENDS ON YOUR READ OF THE COMMITTEE AND WHERE YOU WANT TO GO WITH THIS -- I WOULD BE WILLING TO VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY. I WITH -- WITH WITH A COUPLE KEY AREAS OF CLARITY ONE WOULD BE AT A 10% PER YOU UNIT CAP PER CITY SO AS TO MAKE SURE THAT JUST TO ENSURE THERE'S NOT A BLOW OUT. OF A REAL ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT V. AN T. WITH THAT. YOU KNOW AND AND IF AND IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO TO GET IT RESOLVED I WOULD RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE IF. A MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE WASN'T YOU KNOW WHAT WASN'T WILLING TO KEEP GOING FOR WITH THE WITH YOUR FOR YOUR VERSION. I AND SIX UNITS PER ACRE -- SO WITH THAT WITH THAT. WITH WITH THOSE -- PROVIDES AS I WOULD BE ONE OF THE FOR TODAY NOW AS I SAY IF YOU'RE NOT. IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU YOU KNOW YOU GOT THE VOTES -- WITHOUT ME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THOSE -- BUT THAT'S A DECISION IN A MINUTE LEAVE TO YOU. AND A AND I'M I'M I'M I'M CERTAINLY NOT OFFENDED WHETHER WAY WE YOU KNOW WE BOTH WORKED HARD ON THIS AND AND I I THINK NO MATTER WHAT I FEEL LIKE. THE BILL AT LEAST IN A BETTER PLACE FOR MY PERSPECTIVE THAN IT WAS BEFORE CAME TO US SO. I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR LIKE I BY EXCEPT THE THREE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE ALREADY AGREED ON D. TWO F. -- SO THAT'S VERY CLEAR ON THE RECORD PROJECT I'M TAKING THOSE. AB AND C. AT THINKER WHERE WE'VE BEEN HAVING DISCUSSION RIGHT -- I THINK THE L. ONE I CAN WHAT I WANT TO COMMIT TO US THE CAP ISSUE IS WHAT I WANT TO COMMIT TO YOU YET IS A IS A CONTINUE GOOD FAITH. DISCUSSION AS WE'VE ALREADY BEEN HAVING [inaudible] GOING FORWARD -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE ACTUALLY IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GETTING CLOSE ON A ON A POTENTIAL DWELLING UNIT -- MAYES SAID SIX YEAH I THINK AND I THINK. THAT IF AND I'M AND I'M NOT OPPOSED TO A CAP I JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE TOLD WHAT THAT CAN BE WE LOST FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS RIGHT SO I'M REALLY TRYING TO REPLACE? WHAT'S BEEN LOST RIGHT FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND I THINK WE'LL MEET A LOT OF OUR DISCUSSION IS CENTERING AROUND. NOBODY HERE. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH HAVING INFILL MULTI FAMILY AND ALL THAT LIKE. THIS BILL WILL DO THAT. THIS BILL WILL DO THAT RIGHT -- BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE THE STATS AND WE HAD NINE THOUSAND SINGLE FAMILY HOMES LOST IN THIS FIRE SO. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD. IN KIND WHAT HAS BEEN LOST AND SO. IF YOU HAVE TO DANCE REQUIREMENTS OR IF. WERE OF THE V. M. T. IS SUCH THAT IS GOING TO PRECLUDE YOU FROM. YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO BUILD SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT IS WHAT'S NOT WORKABLE AND I NEED TO UNDERSTAND. HOW IT'S GONNA HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK GOING FORWARD SORRY? HI WILL IN GOOD FAITH CONTINUE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BOTH THAT. THE THE DWELLING UNIT PER ACRE -- AND THE AND THE CAP. BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN GET THERE ON SOME ON BOTH OF THOSE ITEMS. WHICH REFERRED ME AND PETE VMT I JUST I MEAN. EVERYTHING THAT I'M HERE A MAN IS LIKE THAT. THIS COMPLEX AND NONE OF MY JURISDICTIONS WOULD KNOW HOW TO COMPLY WITH THAT AND THAT IS THAT THAT'S SO BECAUSE HE'S REALLY IF WE'RE IF WE'RE GONNA FOUR IN A ROW FOR THE LOW DENSITY THE BEAUTIES REALLY IMPORTANT MEDIUM AND I SAY THIS IS NOT. IS NOT COMPARING THE ANTI BETWEEN YOUR COMMUNITY AND A CITY IT'S NOT IT'S ABOUT IT'S IT'S CONTEXTUALIZING WITHIN THE REGION. TELL YOU WHAT WHEN WE DO THIS ONE WE ACCEPT THE MOTION.

THIS IS. A VERY REAL. RESEARCHERS AND THEIR SENATORS AGAIN SECTION A YOUR EFFORT AND YOUR STAFF. FOR A PHONE THE WORKING ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE A SEVENTEEN D. COMING HE AMENDMENT. DOES THE SCHOOL THIS BILL IS REALLY SIMPLE WE WANT TO GIFT CAL RECYCLED THE TOOLS. TO OVERSEE THIS PROGRAM WHICH WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY TEN BY TENS OF ASSEMBLY SPEAKER OF PROGRESS. TO MEET THE STATE RECYCLING GOAL. AB TWO TWENTIES. SEVEN IT IS A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE STATE THE TOOL TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIENCY IN THIS CARPET THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. AND THIS BILL WILL ALSO A PROVIDE INCENTIVE FOR CONSUMERS TO BUY EASIER TO RECYCLE CARPET. AND GIVEN THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THE TOOLS NEEDED TO OVERSEE THE PROGRAM. PERSONS WILL ALLOW FOR A BRIDGE PROGRAM IN THE CASE OFFICE TO WORSHIP ORGANIZATION CEASE OPERATIONS. OR A PLAN IS DISAPPROVED. TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FEET AND CONTINUE RECYCLING TO SPILL REQUIRE THE TRANSFER OF TO AN EXPANDED CONSUMER FEES. TO BE DEPOSITED INTO TRUST OR ASK TOOL TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM. DUE TO THE HISTORY OF NON COMPLIANCE WAS A STATUE MARIE REQUIREMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCE RE RESOURCE RECYCLE AND RECOVERY OR CAL RECYCLED. NEED TO LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES AND APPROPRIATE. THE OVERS OVERSIGHT TO MEET CALL CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING GOAL. TO DO THIS A. B. SEVEN TWENTY NINE INCREASED TO CEILING FOR A CIVIL PENALTY FROM ONE THOUSAND PER DAY TWO FIVE THOUSAND PER DAY. TO ALLOW CAL RECYCLE -- DETERRED FUTURE VIOLATIONS. IN A IN ADDITION DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT CAL RECYCLE STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES UTILIZED. TO HELP BRING DOES PROGRAMMING INTO COMPLIANCE. DURING THE LAST THREE ALTHOUGH FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THINGS TO CREATION OF THIS PROGRAM. THE CALLS HOWEVER EXCEED THE STATUTORY 5% CAP ON ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. SO THIS RESULT TO CAL RECYCLE SHIFTING SOME RESOURCES TO SUBSIDIZE THE CARPET RECYCLING PROGRAM. AND DOES WHAT DOES BILL REMOVED A CAB. ALLOW KILL RECYCLE TO LEVY A QUARTERLY FEET THAT MEANS TO OF FULL MS ADMINISTRATIVE AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM. FINALLY THIS BILL DIRECT THIS TO OR SHOULD ORGANIZATION TO IMPLEMENT A DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT THAT WERE INCENTIVE SITES CUSTOMERS TO BUY EASIER TO RECYCLE COPPERED AND MADE OF RECYCLED. MATERIALS IN THE MARKETPLACE. AGAIN -- WAS MEETING HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OUR JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL. AND GREAT CAMPBELL ON BEHALF OF THE INTERFACE WHICH IS THE CARPET THE MANUFACTURE MISTER SCHMEISER. BASED ON MISTER WHAT COUNTIES. I WILL BE ABLE TO THAT -- I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. AT A FEW POINTS VERY QUICKLY -- FIRST I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY BACKS AND ACTION COUNCIL I ALSO ALAMEDA STOP WASTE AND WESTERN PLASTER WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY. I DO WANT TO SPEAK TO ONE POINT IN THE OPPOSITION LETTER THE COALITION LETTER FROM C. B. I IN THE CHAMBER AROUND HOUSING PRICES -- WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LAST NIGHT. JUST REALLY QUICKLY THE AVERAGE -- SQUARE FOOTAGE OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY ONE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET THAT'S TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE SQUARE YARDS EVEN IF CARE DECIDED ON THEIR OWN TO DOUBLE THE FEE FOR THIS LESS EXPENSIVE CARPET -- THIS. CARPET THAT ISN'T AS RECYCLABLE -- THAT WOULD ADD EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS TO THE PROCESS THE PRICE OF HOUSING -- THE AVERAGE HOUSE AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA LITERALLY EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS SO I THINK HOPEFULLY -- THE COMMITTEE CAN SET ASIDE THIS pTHIS BILL ON HOUSING PRICES I THINK IT'S A NON ISSUE -- AT EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS -- AND WITH THAT I'LL JUST BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BASED ON THE MOTION THANK YOU. SHERMAN MEMBERS GREG CAMPBELL MAP INTERFACE INTERFACE IS A LARGE CARPET MANUFACTURER AND RECYCLER BASED IN GEORGIA WE ARE MEMBERS OF CAREHAD BEEN SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TO BE VERY HAPPY WITH YOU YES THE WHERE WHERE THE FATE WHERE THE FAVORITE CHILD -- AND HONESTLY WE DON'T WANT TO BE HERE CONSIDERED HAVE LEGISLATION -- TO TRY TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK BETTER BUT THE CONTINUAL NON COMPLIANCE OF CARE HAS KIND OF LEFT US NO CHOICE BUT TO SUPPORT A LEGISLATION LIKE A. B.. SEVEN TO NINE EVERYBODY'S HEAD ON MOST THE POINTS. THE IMPORTANCE OF A BRIDGE PLAN GIVEN THE FACT THAT FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY CAN EVEN GET A PLAN APPROVED. AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHILE GETTING SOMETHING APPROVED THE DIRECTOR HAS SAID VERY SPECIFICALLY IF THEY DON'T DO A NUMBER OF THINGS. THERE WE RELOCATION AND RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE BIG REASONS WHY THAT PROBABLY WILL NOT HAPPEN IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE SIXTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT HAPPENS THE INFRASTRUCTURE. OF THE RECYCLING -- INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA IF -- THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION GOES AWAY WE DON'T WANT THEM TO GO AWAY EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T LIKE US ON THE BOARD HOW WE LIKE FOR CARE TO CONTINUE BUT WE JUST THINK THEY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD THE GOALS. THE SECOND THING. THE FEE SHOULD BE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO GET CARPET OUT OF LANDFILLS. AND IN TO RECYCLE OR REUSE -- TO HAVE A FEW STRUCTURE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL ASSUMES AN ARC OF CARPET IS THE SAME ALL CORPORATE IS NOT. SOME CARPET IS MORE RECYCLABLE THAN OTHERS THIS BILL SIMPLY MOVES THE BALL TOWARDS HAVING A HIGHER FEE FOR CARPET THAT IS HARDER TO RECYCLE AND A LOWER FEE FOR CARPET THAT IS EASIER RECYCLE. WE DON'T THINK THAT'S CONSISTENT AND WILL ALLOW FOR A BETTER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE PROGRAM AND FOR THAT WE ASK FOR MY BILL. OKAY OUR FOLKS WANT TO ADD THEIR SUPPORT VOICE SUPPORT EVERY SINGLE. HELLO I AM ANDREW MENTOR WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS BILL IN THIS MODEL ALSO THE DIFFERENTIATION OF FEES. BECAUSE THERE ARE TOXIC MATERIALS IN SOME CARPETS THAT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING BACK INTO THE RECYCLING MODE. AND WE THINK THAT WILL HELP DRIVE THE REDUCTION OF THOSE TOXIC MATERIALS SO JUST WANT TO BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS JULIE LIEBERMAN HERE WITH CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. HERE TOO SO ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN SUPPORT. NATALIE MAX ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE IN SUPPORT. SELECT US HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS -- CHIEF COUNCIL AND US ALWAYS ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA IN SUPPORT. OR FRONT TABLE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL NORTHERN DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. OKAY -- OTHER FOLKS VOICE IN SUPPORT [inaudible] WELL ENOUGH. YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A LONG MORNING. OKAY -- LE FOLKS MY POSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN ALLOW PHYSICIANS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RAINY POLLOCK ON BEHALF OF THE CARPET AND RUG INSTITUTE OUR MEMBERS ARE MANUFACTURES OF CARPET THEY'RE ALSO MEMBERS OF CARE THAT'S A STEWARDSHIP. ORGANIZATION -- WE'RE HERE TODAY -- YOU KNOW AGAIN ANOTHER YEAR ANOTHER CARPET DALE -- AND YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF US ARE SAYING JUST WHAT THE PROGRAM WORK I YEAH I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT OVER THE YEARS THAT WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PROVING THE RECYCLING RATE WHEN WE SEE THE OVERALL STATE RECYCLING RIGHT CONTINUE TO DROP THERE HAS BEEN IMPROVEMENT A SERVER YOU HAVE BEEN OUT TO SOME OF THESE FACILITIES AND SEEN THE RECYCLING OF CARPET HAPPENING. WHERE WE HAVE CONCERNS IS DEALING WITH THE DIFFERENTIAL? BACK IN FEBRUARY CAL RECYCLE APPROVED THE PLAN. THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY THICK CARPET ADVISORY COUNCIL. THAT CARE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE WITHIN A ONE YEAR TIME FRAME TO LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL DIFFERENTIAL. DURING THAT TIME THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS THERE'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS A DIFFERENTIAL COULD BE SET UP SHOULD BE BASED UPON COSTS SHOULD BE BASED UPON FIBER TYPE SHOULD BE BASED UPON. A RECYCLING SO WHAT WE'RE HERE IS WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT THE CARDS BEFORE THE HORSE HERE. MANY TIMES THE COMMITTEE ALWAYS WANT TO SEE INFORMATION I THINK CENTER STERN SAID EARLIER NOW LET'S HAVE INFORMATION BE GIVEN TWICE BEFORE BEFORE WE MAKE A DECISION. SO ARE REQUEST TODAY IS WHY ARE WE RUSHING AND MANDATING SOMETHING THAT MAYBE MAY NOT WORK AFTER INVESTIGATIONAFTER ANALYSIS IS BEING DONE WITH CAL RECYCLE AND ALSO WITH -- THE ADVISORY BOARD WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IF WE MADE SIX AWAIT SIX MONTHS INTO NEXT YEAR UNTIL THIS COMMITTEE GETS ALL THE INFORMATION. LOOKS AT IT AND THEN MAKES A DETERMINATION. SO WE BELIEVE THAT IS A PROCESS THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAIN HERE THIS IS THE PROCESS THAT WE WE WOULD BE FAIR TO ALL THE PARTIES BECAUSE THAT AT THAT TIME YOU HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION NECESSARY. TO MAKE WE BELIEVE A CREDIBLE A DETERMINATION I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IN THE DRAFTING OF THIS AMENDMENT. THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE WERE ANY MEETINGS HELD WAS STAKEHOLDERS LIKE THE RETAILERS WHO WILL BE VERY AFFECTED BY THIS I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY CONSIDERATION OF OTHER. WAY SIX SET UP THE DIFFERENTIAL I DON'T THINK THERE IS A DISCUSSION WITH CAL RECYCLE OR THE CORPORATE VICE REPORT ABOUT WHAT DIFFERENTIAL SHOULD BE IN PLACE. THEREFORE WE WOULD LIKE TO DEFER THIS THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT IS CONCERNED A BRIDGE PLAN WE UNDERSTAND A BRIDGE PLAN SHOULD BE -- SHOULD BE SET UP HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WHERE YOU HAVE A PROGRAM AFTER ONE YEAR IF CAL RECYCLE CANNOT IDENTIFY ANOTHER ENTITY THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE PROGRAM AND RUN IT. THAT GIVES US CONCERNED AND FOR THE REMAINING CONCERNS OUT TURN IT OVER THE MICROBES THANK YOU. HI HAT MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF OF MOHAWK INDUSTRIES -- IT AND AND WE WE'VE TALKED A LOT OF YOU OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO ABOUT THIS IS ALL TRY TO BE QUICK. AND NOW I HAVE THE BENEFIT OF AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS TO TALK ABOUT SO JUST RATHER THAN WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE JUST. SOME SOME SOME POINTS TO IT JUST KIND OF FURTHER WERE WET WITH MISTER POLLOCK JUST SAID ABOUT YOU MEET MAYBE YOU KNOW HOLDING THE BILL. HAPPENS MORE OVERSIGHT JUST YOU KNOW THE SONG POINTS OUT SOME SOME ITEMS ON IN HER COMIC NUMBER TWO ON PAGE. THIRTY EIGHT PAGE EIGHT I'M. SHE ASKED THE QUESTION -- YOU KNOW WHO WOULD BE COULD BE THE STORED IN THE EVENT THAT CARE IS NOT THE STORED IN MAYBE CARE ISN'T THE RIGHT STORE GIVEN THE CONTENTIOUS HISTORY WITH -- CALORIE CYCLE OVER THE YEARS EXCELLENT QUESTION -- IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I MEAN WHAT IF YOU KNOW WHERE WE WERE PLANNING THE DEMISE OF CARE WITH THIS BILL THAT WE'RE WE'RE JUST ASSUMING CARE IS NOT GONNA EXIST IN THAT CAR SECONDS GOING TO GET RID OF CARE. WE WOULD YOU KNOW CARES ON ON ON A TRAJECTORY TO MEET THE RECYCLING GOALS IF IF THEY MEET THE RECYCLING LOST OR IF THEY'RE JUST LIKE A PERCENT OR TWO OFF IS IS IS THAT WERE THE OF GETTING RID OF CARE. AND MAYBE THE COMMITTEE OUGHT TO JUST. HOLD THE BILL AND HAVE A HAVE A FULL INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON WHO SHOULD BE THE STEWARD IT SHOULD BE CARE SHOULD BE CARRY CYCLE IS ANOTHER ENTITY. GOOD GOOD GOOD QUESTION ACTUALLY QUESTION BROUGHT UP ANNOUNCES -- THERE AND SHE'S DEAD THE THERE'S THE COMMENT NUMBER THREE TALKING ABOUT -- THE THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE CAP THE THAT THAT WAS ADDED TO THE BILL IN JUNE ON JUNE TWENTIETH SO THAT THAT THE THIS REMOVAL OF THE CAP WAS NEVER DISCUSSED IN THE ASSEMBLY IT'S A NEW PART OF THE BILL. IT'S REALLY THAT THAT ALONE. REMOVING CARRY CYCLES ABILITY TO IT YOU KNOW COVER CYCLES ADMINISTRATIVE FEE CAP 5% THAT'S WORTHY OF A BILL ON ITS OWN AND NOT NOT JUST THROWN INTO THIS BILL. THE EVENING OF THE THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IN THIS COMMITTEE MAYBE YOU KNOW. SHE CHASSIS EXCELLENT QUESTION YOU KNOW WITH THE THREE OUT OF SEVEN YEARS -- THEY'RE CAUGHT THE COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM HAVE HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR WHY IS THAT YOU JUST WE JUST ACCEPT THE FACT THAT? WELL THE MEET THE MOST NEED MORE MONEY WE SHOULD REMOVE THE CAP WELL MAYBE MAYBE THEY SHOULD ASK WHY WHY WHY DID THE X. EITHER FEE CAPPING THE THE THREE OF THOSE YEARS AS TO CONFORM POINT OUT. THEY WERE SUING CARE WHEN THE MISSION THE BEEN SOON CARE THEY THEY WOULD YOU KNOW THE THE RUNNING UP THEIR COSTS TO SUE CARE THEY WERE SEEKING ONE POINT EIGHT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT A CARE. IN THE MINISTRY OF LODGES WHACKED HIM DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SOMETHING THAT I MEAN I THINK THEY WERE BANKING ON THAT MONEY AND THEY RAN UP LEGAL BILL. AND NOW USE AND FEEDING GET IT AND FINANCING WILL REMOVE A FEW CAPEN GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD POLICY QUESTION COULD BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE OVERSIGHT QUESTION. MAYBE HOLD THE BILL FOR THAT -- AND FINALLY A TOTALLY HEAR YOU BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF WHATTHE BILL PASSES. IN CAL RECYCLE COULD DOES DISAPPROVE CARES PLANTS ITEM -- AND THEN YOU KNOW THEN WHAT RATE WELL AND THEN DIDN'T THIS BILL SITTING IN THIS COMMITTEE I MEAN IF THE IF THEY DISAPPROVE COUNT CALORIES I THINK WOULD DISAPPROVE CARE IN DECEMBER NOVEMBER WHENEVER THEY COULD DO THAT ANY TIME AND AND AND YOU KNOW THE MONEY'S GONNA CONTINUE TO PHONE. THE FUND THE THEY'LL THEY'LL MINISTER THE PROGRAMMING ME CAN'T YOU CAN'T SELL CARPET INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT CONTINUE TO PUSH MONEY INTO THE PROGRAM THE INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS. I MEAN YOU WHEN YOU WENT OUT AND SAW THE RECYCLER IN IN IN IN LINCOLN YOU KNOW WE'D BE FURTHER ALONG THIS PROCESS OF CARE AND IF CARRY CYCLES A LITTLE QUICKER IN IN IN IN IN APPROVING THE PLAN THAT THEY DID FINALLY APPROVED -- IT YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD QUESTION. RIGHT NOW -- MR MAGISTER RESPOND THAT AND CURRENT STATUTE ALLOWS MANUFACTURERS TO CONTINUE SELL CARPET IN THE CALIFORNIA FOR ONE YEAR AFTER IF THE PLAN IS SORT OF TERMINATOR RESULT SONGS IT'S COMPLYING WITH THE CURRENT PLAN. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL STILL BE ON GOING MY LAST ONE JUST SINCE I COULDN'T FIND IT'S JUST YOU KNOW ON THE RECYCLABILITY OF CARPET YES JUST YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S EASY YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S THE HIGHEST RECYCLABLE MOST RECYCLABLE TODAY MAY NOT BE THE HIGHEST RECYCLE. MOST RECYCLED TOMORROW I MEAN TECHNOLOGY IS EVOLVING I MEAN YOU YOU I JUST HEARD AB SEVEN NINETY TWO BY TEAM EARLIER YOU KNOW THE THE THE PLASTIC RESIN MARKET IS IS. QUICKLY MOVING TECH TIP TO TO TO DO TINGS AND YOU KNOW PT CARPET WHICH YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IS WERE ALL PLASTIC BOTTLES ARE GOING AS PT CARPET ANY AND AND PT CARPET IS 1100%. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A LOT OF P. T. AND AND A LOT OF RECYCLED PTM PT CARPET. THE THE ALLEGATION HERE IS THAT IT'S HARD TO RECYCLE IT WELL YOU YOU THOUGHT BEING RECYCLED IS BEING CART THAT CARPET IS BEING RECYCLED AND IN THE AND IT'S AND IT'S PROGRESSING ANNEKE AND IT COULD BE THE EASIEST RECYCLED CARPET IN A YEAR OR TWO SO. YOU KNOW WE DON'T WALKING INTO A WAY TO DO AN ASSESSMENT WE HAS THE ABILITY AS THE ADMINISTRATOR. TO DO THINGS. OKAY ALL RIGHT I'M I'M IN A PATH. TO DETERMINE A SIGN AND I'LL BE RIGHT. BUT WE WANT TO HEAR FROM OTHER FOLKS ONE OUT ABOUT. IS THERE ARE OTHER OPPOSITION TO AB. SEVEN TWENTY NINE I RECOMMEND AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE WANNA LINER COMES WITH THE OPPOSITION AND THEN JUST TO RESPOND -- WE DO THINK ANY AGGREGATE COSTS TO HOUSING.

OUR STATE IS A DESTINATION FOR NEW SUPPLIES OF THIS NON FLOATING OIL. AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR CURRENT STATE LAW WE DO NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNT FOR SPILLS OF NON FOR AN OIL. AND THIS GREAT SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR OUR STATE AND IN PARTICULAR IT CREATES A RISK FOR OUR COASTAL AREAS. I SAFETY PREPAREDNESS IS IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE. I AND AS PREVIOUSLY AS A PREVIOUS -- A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTED WE CAN LEARN FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN WHEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN A RUPTURED PIPELINE. RESULTED IN A SPILL INTO THE KALAMAZOO RIVER A SPILL OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND THE GALLONS OF NON VOTING CANADIAN TAR SANDS OIL. IT WAS CITED AS THE LARGEST OIL SPILL YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THE REMEDIATION OF THIS BILL TOOK FIVE YEARS COST OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. AND ACCORDING TO US AGENCIES TOTAL CLEANUP PROVED IMPOSSIBLE AND CONTAMINATION REMAINS TO THIS DAY. THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL NINE THREE SIX IS ABOUT SAFETY AND PREPAREDNESS. AGAIN THIS LEGISLATION MANDATES AN UPDATE OF CALIFORNIA'S -- THE CONTINGENCY PLANNING TO SURE THAT THE OFFICE OF SPILL PREVENTION AND RUDE AND AND RESPONSE OSCAR IS ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO DEAL WITH SPILLS OF THESE NON FORTY OILS. OUR OILS MOST LIKELY TO CAUSE LASTING -- THE DAMAGE TO OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT WATER REYES AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND WITH THAT -- LET'S HEAR FROM. HER WE HAVE THE SPONSORS AND WE HAVE -- SO FOLKS DOES WELL ALL OF THEM TO DO SOMETHING. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JOHN ROSENFIELD SENIOR SCIENTIST FOR SAN FRANCISCO BAY KEEPER HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. NINE THIRTY SIX SAN FRANCISCO BAY IS AT RISK FROM PLANS TO PRODUCE MORE NON FLOATING OIL. NOT ALL OIL IS THE SAME AND WE NEED TO PREPARE DIFFERENTLY FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPILLS. THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOUND THAT CURRENT OIL SPILL RESPONSES BASED ON EXPERIENCE WITH FLOATING OILS FOR NOT ADEQUATE FIRST BILL OF NON POLLUTING WHILE. CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL ECONOMY. LOCAL AN OFTEN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND OUR FRAGILE SAN FRANCISCO BAY ECOSYSTEM WOULD BE SEVERELY DAMAGED BY A SPELL OF NON FLOODING OIL. WHAT DOES THAT DO NOT FLOAT ARE PARTICULARLY DAMAGING TO BOTTOM DWELLING ORGANISMS AND THEIR HABITATS? IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY SUCH AS BILL WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHERIES FOR HALIBUT. TENSION IS CRAB STURGEON JUST TO NAME A FEW. SPILLS NON FLOATING OIL ARE NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO DETECT TRACKING REMEDIATE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT VISIBLE FROM THE SURFACE. SOME WOMEN RIVAS MENTIONED -- KALAMAZOO RIVER SPILL. THAT CLEAN UP EFFORT HAS BECOME THE MOST COSTLY SPELL IN. STILL NOT COMPLETED. CLEANING THIS BILL ON THE BAY WOULD BE FAR MORE CHALLENGING THAN ONE CONFINED TO A RIVER BED BECAUSE IN THE DAY THIS MATERIAL CAN SPREAD IN ALL DIRECTIONS. AND A GREATER DEPTHS. NON FLOATING OIL SPILLS IN PORT WOULD IMPACT THE HEALTH OF RESIDENTS IN SOME OF THE BAY AREA'S MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. COMMUNITIES NEAR THE BASE PORTS AND REFINERIES ALREADY EXPERIENCED DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS TO THE SHORELINE AIR QUALITY AND HEALTH. THIS BILL OF NON FLOODING ALSO WOULD BE YET ANOTHER IMPACT FOR THESE COMMUNITIES TO BEAR. AB NINE THIRTY SIX WOULD BEGIN TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS BY REQUIRING GREATER PREPARATION FOR SPILLS OF NON FLOODING LYLE'S. TRANSPORTED THROUGH THE BAY AREA. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THE KIND OF REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS THAT WASHINGTON AND STATE HAS ALREADY TAKEN I RESPECTFULLY ASK. YOUR NEXT WITNESS I WOULD ALSO ADD TO YOUR TESTIMONY THAT. HE SOUTH BAY WHICH GETS STUCK WITH THE SLOW CURRENTS WOULD ACTUALLY EVENTUALLY GET ALL THE NON FLOATING OIL SETTLING THERE AS ALL THE OTHER. TOXINS SETTLE IN THE SOUTH BAY THE NEXT IN ARE YOU SEE WITH YOUR FROM YOUR YES -- GOOD AFTERNOON I'M AN ALEXANDER A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. NINE THIRTY SIX THIS LEGISLATION TAKES SOME STRAIGHT FORWARD VERY COMMON SENSE STEPS TOWARD ADDRESSING THE THREAT OF NON POLLUTING OIL THAT ARE CO SPONSORS ARTICULATED. OF FIRST OF ALL IT DEFINES NON FLOATING WHILE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SOLVE A PROBLEM UNTIL YOU'VE NAMED AT THE U. S. COAST GUARD HAS RECOGNIZED SPECIFICALLY IN ITS GUIDANCE. THAT NON FLOATING OIL IS A DISTINCT CATEGORY OF THREAT AND NOW CALIFORNIA CAN DO THE SAME. AND SECOND OF ALL IT STUDIES NON FLOATING OIL AB NINE THIRTY SIX CALLS ON OSCAR TO HOLD THE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP. EXCLUSIVELY DEVOTED TO NON FLOATING OIL AND ALSO TO COMPLETE A COME A LITERATURE REVIEW. OF LITERATURE CONCERNING A NON POLLUTING OIL CLEANUP TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S DEPLOYING THE BEST METHODS THERE ARE OUT THERE. FOR CLEANING UP THIS TYPE OF OIL BEFORE IT SINKS TO THE BOTTOM AND WEEKS THAT KIND OF HAVOC. THATHAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN OUR WATERS. AND FINALLY AB NINE THIRTY SIX PREPARES FOR THE WORST PREPARES FOR A SPELL OF NON FLOATING OIL -- IT REQUIRES THAT CALIFORNIA'S STILL CONTINGENCY PLANNING BE UPDATED TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY NON POLLUTING OIL. IT REQUIRES THAT OSCAR CREATE A SPECIAL RATING CATEGORY FOR THE OIL SPEED AT THE OIL SPILL CLEANUP ORGANIZATIONS OR OFFICE ROSE -- TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE QUALIFIED TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY NON FLOATING OIL. I AND IT REQUIRES THAT ANY TANKER THAT'S COMING INTO THE STATE WITH NON FLOATING OIL IDENTIFY AN AUSTRO THAT IS SPECIFICALLY QUALIFIED TO ADDRESS THAT TYPE OF OIL. SO CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL THE WORST BANDS BEFORE IT TAKES PRECAUTIONS AB NINE THIRTY SIX TAKES THOSE PRECAUTIONS NOW I THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. IF ANYONE WANT TO ADD ON SUPPORT. WE WANT ACTION. YES. SURPRISE SURPRISE -- BUT ONE OF THE REASONS I WANT TO ADD TO THIS IS THAT. PART OF MY SPECIFIC WORK -- IS TO WORK WITH THE ISSUE OF SUBSISTENCE FISHING IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND YOU KNOW THE EFFECTS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT. THE FISSION AND THE LOW DWELLING.

AN ADAPTATION LEADERSHIP COORDINATION ACT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE ACT THIS ACT REQUIRES THE SECRETARY NOW TO RESOURCES AGENCY TO COLLABORATE WITH OUTSIDE NATIONS ON HOW TO SUPPORT AND PROMOTE THE GOALS POLICIES. AND BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES RELATED TO A GLOBALLY SHARED OCEAN. RESPECTFULLY THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES CURRENTLY OVERSEES PROTECTION OF THE OCEAN AND COAST BUT THE HEALTH OF THE STATE AGENCIES AND OUTSIDE PARTNERS THESE COLLABORATION EFFORTS ARE STRICTLY WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S COAST AND OCEAN. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT STATURE FOR THE SECRETARY TO COLLABORATE OR COMMUNICATE WITH OUTSIDE NATIONS TO ADDRESS THE MOST. PERTINENT ISSUES THREATENING OUR SHARED OCEAN. IT'S REALLY SIMPLE BILL REALLY EASY JUST ASKING THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO WORK WITH OTHER STATES AND OTHER. NATIONAL SUBNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. THAT KIND OF A HIVE OF INFORMATION WHEN IT COMES TO HOW WE CAN. PASS IN AND DEVELOP LAWLESS IS TO PROTECT THE OCEAN IF SOMETHING IS IMPORTANT -- EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US -- AND WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO GET. TOO FAR ALONG DOWN THE LINE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR OCEAN IF WE HAVE A BUNCH OF A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT POLICIES IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF A CONVERSATION HAPPENING BACK AND FORTH AND WE THINK THAT THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES. IS THE ONE BEST SUITED TO CARRY OUT THIS PLAN AND THIS GOAL CONSIDERING THAT THEY ARE HE IS ALREADY DOING THIS AND IS AGENCIES ALREADY OVERSEEING THIS ISSUES AND SO WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THE SUPPORT MEASURE. CRAFT THANK YOU YES WE HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON NATALIE MAX ON BEHALF OF OCEAN CONSERVANCY. CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE IN FULL FORCE BOTH ON LAND AND IN THE OCEAN YOU MUST EXPAND OUR EFFORTS TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGES THAT ARE ALREADY UPON US AND ARE CERTAIN TO WORSEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

I DON'T YOU CONSERVANCY WE HAVE LONG SUPPORTED EFFORTS TO ENHANCE KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT AND EXCHANGE AMONG OTHERWISE INDEPENDENT BODIES ESPECIALLY AROUND OCEAN CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LIGHTS TO COMBAT OCEAN ACIDIFICATION WE HAVE ACTIVELY SUPPORTED THIS INTERNATIONAL EFFORT EVER SENSE. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS EFFORT AND AS A RESULT THE ALLIANCE'S EXCEPT IS ACCELERATING ACTION AMONG GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER ENTITIES. AS CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE CALIFORNIA'S CONTENT MUST CONTINUE TO BE A CRITICAL VOICE AN ADAPTATION POLICY RESEARCH BRING NOBLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT. THE WORLD HAS A LOT TO LEARN FROM OUR EFFORTS AND SIMILARLY BE CAN BENEFIT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS THIS IS BY WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT TODAY ON EIGHTY NINE SEVEN FIVE IT WILL HELP INSURE CALIFORNIA IS PREPARED. FOR WHAT IS TO COME. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SIR. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ OUT THAT EXCUSE ME READ ADDISON BEHALF TO SEE THE REDWOODS LEAGUE HERE IN SUPPORT TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE LAND SIDE OF THIS EQUATION AS WELL THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITIES TO OUR RATHER IN UP NORTH AND SOUTH WE ARE THERE'S COORDINATION AND ACTIONS. AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE THAT DON'T JUST STOP AT THE BORDER IT'S FOR THAT REASON WE'RE IN SUPPORT TODAY. HISTORICALLY THE RESOURCES SECRETARY AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAVE ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS NEVER REALLY PUT ANYTHING IN THE CODE HASN'T COULD A STAT IT HASN'T CREATED A STATUE TO PUT. PARAMETERS CRITERIA AROUND THAT WE THINK THIS BILL. GOES ALONG WITH SETTING THE STAGE FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES IN THERE FOR SUPPORT. I WOULD ALSO BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION IT SENATOR Y. CASKET HAS A NUMBER POLICY IDEAS. AROUND HOW THE STATE SHOULD BE DOING ACTIVITIES AS WELL AND WHILE WE KNOW WE'VE WORKED THROUGH BOTH. A COMMITTEE TO DIFFERENT POLICY COMMITTEES HERE IN THE SENATE. I'M ASSUMING IF THE SENATOR WILL RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT -- PR. AT SOME POINT WE PRIDE BE VERY OPEN TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND WHETHER THEY THINK ANOTHER. ENTITY OTHER THAN THE RESOURCES SECTOR SHOULD BE THE PERSON SO THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. I'M OTHER FOLKS ONE OUT ON IN SUPPORT. ONE REYES OPPOSITION CONCERNS. OKAY BANDS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS BUT THEN WILL COST. MY SCHOOL CHAMPION. I THINK THE STAFF REPORT DOES A GOOD JOB OF DISCUSSING DE I GUESS THE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WE HAVE I THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING AN INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON. IS IS APPROPRIATE -- S. O. P. R. HAS -- CHOIR CERTAIN JURISDICTION OVER STATE POLICY FOR ROUTE ALL THE AGENT THROUGHOUT ALL THE AGENCIES NOT JUST WITH RESOURCES BUT WITH PUBLIC CAL WITH AGRICULTURE WHICH TRANSPORTATION. SO I'M. YOU TO YOUR BILL YOUR BILL I AM I I BELIEVE THAT I'M MOVING FORWARD WITH BED RESILIENCY OFFICER THAT WOULD CODIFY WITHIN. R. AS IN STATUTE. THE EXISTENCE OF WERE I KNOW IF PEOPLE HISTORICALLY BEEN CONCERT OKAY ARE GIVEN WHAT GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER DID THING JUST SORT OF CHANGE CHANGE OF BODY ELSE WITH THE CONVOCATION. I WANT LIKE YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT HOW THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE APPARATUS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT. WITH WITH THE RESILIENT OFFICER WITHIN THE OAK BAR. OPPOSITION AND THEN HAVING THAT. THIS FUNCTION IN OPR MEMBER I'M ARGUING FOR OKAY ARE AND NOT NECESSARILY A CANCER RESOURCE AGENCY BUT FOR OKAY ARE FOR THESE. ADAPTATION AND LONG TERM PLANNING. I MEAN I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT TO SAY THAT YOUR IDEA IS. NOT AS GOOD AS OUR IDEA AND I MEAN I MEAN I THINK. YOU KNOW THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS IS. YOU KNOW WE'VE NEVER GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO CLOSE TO CARRY THIS OUT THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES ALREADY WORKS WITH -- P. R. TO TRY TO WORK ON THESE THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES SECRETARY NATURAL RESOURCES ALREADY WORKING ON A GLOBAL LEVEL WHEN IT COMES TO DIFFERENT ISSUES JUST NOT THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. AND SO I MEAN MY ARGUMENT WOULD BE WHY NOT GIVE THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES THE OPPORTUNITY TO CARRY OUT THESE THESE DUTIES BEFORE WE'VE WE DECIDE TO CREATE AOTHER POSITION I DON'T HAVE AN OPINION. THAT OPR WE SHOULD WE SHOULD IN CREATING A POSITION WITHIN. UNDER OPR OR OR ANYTHING ELSE I JUST THINK THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE WE HAVE AN ENTITYWE HAVE AN AGENCY IS ALREADY WORKING WITH THE P. R. -- SECRETARY MATCH RESOURCES I SECRETARY LAIRD WELL CABLE EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THESE TYPES OF ISSUES ALREADY DEALING WITH THESE TYPES OF ISSUES WE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE. A VERY GOOD OPTION FOR THAT TO HAPPEN -- YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T HEARD. IN NECESSARILY ANYTHING EITHER WAY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS WHAT THEY WOULD. LIKE TO SEE. BUT I DON'T SEE WHY ARE AT LEAST AT THIS POINT BOTH BILL SHOULDN'T BE MOVING FORWARD. UNLESS THAT ADMINISTRATION DECIDES TO PUT THE FINGER ON A SCALE IN SOME WAY THAT OR ANOTHERI JUST WOULDN'T. YOU KNOW THE THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT THE SECRETARY AND WHILE. FORMER SECRETARY LARRY WAS. ACTIVE IN THE IN THE ADAPTATION IS ALSO ACTIVE IN THE CAT YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH IT GIVES THE JURISDICTION. TO THE EPA DIRECTOR HE SORT OF HIS PERSONALITY AND THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WAS SUCH THE THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE ARTISTIC. THE CAUTION THAT I HAVE IS THAT THE P. R. HAS THAT CROSS AGENCY. WHAT IF THEY GET IN A THE POLLING FROM PUBLIC COUNTY PULLING FROM TRANSPORTATION THE POLAND FROM AGRICULTURE TO BE PULLING FROM? AND APPARATUS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE THOUGH I KNOW THE REPORT IS WRITTEN BY THE RESOURCES AGENCY IN THAT AND THAT'S WHERE HOW WE GOT IT SET UP. THAT'S THE NO I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSIONS I'M. N. PARTICULARLY GIVEN YOU KNOW THE OTHER WORK I CARP IN THE D. V. ADAPTATION. ACTIVITY THAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT OKAY ARE. I'M GOING TO STAY OFF THE BILL TODAY [inaudible] YES. THE THEME FOR THE DAY OKAY. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. CATCHES SO I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO I'M ILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION LATER NO PROBLEM -- AND IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL THOUGHTS ON I APPRECIATE THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE SENATOR TO TRY TO RESOLVE. THE ISSUE. WHEN IT HAD TO DO SO BUT AT THIS TIME I THINK? YOU KNOW THE SECRETARY NATURI SOURCES MORE THAN A CABLE EQUIPPED -- SECRETARY RESOURCES IS PROHIBITED WORKING WITH ANY OTHER AGENCY -- IF THEY IF THEY CHOOSE TO WORK WITH THAT AGENCY SUBJECT. DOUBLE TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION -- P. R. HAS ALREADY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH A P. ARE WE THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE -- SELF FOR WHEN IT COMES TO OCEAN RESILIENCY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ON TIMES APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU MUCH I APPRECIATE I WOULD HEAR FROM CYBER CHU. IS HERE TO PRESENT AB. SEVENTEEN FIFTY ONE GOOD AFTERNOON. SENATORS MISTER CHAIR LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. AND THANK THE CONSULTANT FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR OFFICE.

AND THAT THERE ARE WATER DISTRICTS WITH SO MUCH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT THEY'RE ON THE VERGE OF CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER. MANY OF THE SYSTEMS CAN AFFORD TO MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS I NEED. SECOND A COMEDY CONSOLIDATION. CONSOLIDATION CAN ENSURE. THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS RECEIVE CLEAN WATER BUT THE APPROVAL PROCESS CAN OFTEN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING. IT'S A PC'S OBLIGATION TO REVIEW PROPOSED CONSOLIDATIONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY. THEY HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME AND THE LONGER REVIEW TAKES WE NO LONGER ARE CONSTITUENTS ARE LEFT WITH WATER THAT'S NOT DRINKABLE. WE NEED TO BOTH PROTECT EXISTING REPAIRS AND DELIVER CLEAN WATER OUR BILL WOULD IMPOSE FLEXIBLE DEADLINES ON THE CPUC FOR CONSOLIDATION APPROVAL. AND ENSURE THAT THE CPC HELP IMPLEMENT OUR STATE'S POLICY TO PROVIDE CLEAN DRINKING WATER WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. JENNIFER COMPUTER ON BEHALF OF THE WATER ASSOCIATION WHERE THEY SI PC REGULATED WATER UTILITY IS.

FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND ACTUALLY HOUSES SENTENCES YOU ME. A PERSON DOESN'T. EVEN READING. THEM TWENTY TWO IN YOUR PACKETS MEMBERS. YES PLEASE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE PERCENT A. B.. FIFTEEN HUNDRED WHICH WOULD STRAIGHTEN LOCAL AUTHORITY TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST LOCAL THREATS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY INCLUDING THE ABILITY. FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DIRECT THE FACILITY OR A PORTION OF THE FACILITY TO TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUE THE OPERATIONS THAT COST AND EXPOSURE. IN CALIFORNIA MULTIPLE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE JURISDICTION OVER BUSINESSES THAT HANDLE OR GENERATE HAZARDOUS WASTE. AND MATERIALS THAT POSE A RISK TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY LOCALLY A CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE LAWS AND THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER HAS GENERALLY GENERAL AT THE READY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH. AN EXPANDED AUTHORITY ONLY AFTER A COUNTY WIDE EMERGENCY IS DECLARED. CURRENTLY SOME FACILITIES THAT EMIT HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES CONTINUE TO OPERATE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEET. REGULATORY REGULATORY MINIMUM STANDARDS TO CEASE OPERATIONS IMMEDIATELY. A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF ATROCITY IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES IS THE EXIDE BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITY IN VERNON CALIFORNIA WHICH CONTINUOUSLY EXPOSED FAMILIES AND RESIDENTS OF MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE ANOTHER SURROUNDING DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY STUDENT DANGEROUS LEVELS OF TOXIC LEAD. THE DELAY TO SHUT THIS FACILITY DOWN LED TO THE EMISSIONS FROM THE PLANT. CONTAMINATING MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND OF A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ACROSS A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES INCLUDING BOYLE HEIGHTS. AND HE'S LOS ANGELES. ABOUT FIFTY AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED IS A RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS AND FRUSTRATIONS EXPRESSED BY OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THIS BILL IS IMPERATIVE TO ASSURE THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES CLOSEST TO THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY TOXIC POLLUTION. CAN EXPEDITIOUSLY. PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY.

AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED IS ABOUT BUILDING ON EXISTING LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER AUTHORITIES TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST LOCAL THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE THE CURRENT LONGSTANDING AUTHORITY TO IMMEDIATELY ORDER THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF A CONTAMINATED BEACH. TO ORDER THE CLOSURE OF A RESTAURANT FOR UNSANITARY CONDITIONS OR TO TAKE ANY NECESSARY ACTION IN RESPONSE TO FOOD OR WATER BORNE ILLNESS OR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER AUTHORITY OVER THESE ENTITIES IS BASED ON THE ESTABLISHED UNDERSTANDING THAT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MUST PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. HOWEVER WHEN A CHEMICAL THREAT ENDANGERS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS LACK STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO TAKE SIMILAR IMMEDIATE ACTION. AGAINST THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. A LOS SANDERS COUNTY HAS TO FACE NUMEROUS CRISES WHEN WHICH RESPONSIBLE PARTIES RELEASE CHEMICALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT PRESENTING SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I THIS BILL SEEKS TO ALIGN THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER AT THE ALREADY OVER CHEMICAL THREATS WITH ITS ESTABLISHED AUTHORITY TO STOP BIOLOGICAL THREATS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

ARE NOT PAYING THEIR PLEASE I'M. WHEN IF AND WHEN THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT'S HAPPENING CONTRA COSTA COUNTY? OF COURSE IF THEY HAD WE HAD A FACILITY THAT READ THE RESULT IN A SOFT DRINK AS A CLOUD WITH THIS BILL FROM ESPECIALLY. WE'RE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SOUGHT MEDICAL ATTENTION THIS RELEASED. AFTER HIS RELEASE OCCURRED THERE WERE A SERIES OF SMALLER RELEASES FROM THE SAME FACILITY THE IMPACT OF THE COMMUNITY. WE LACK THE ABILITY REQUIRED THAT SALINAS SHOP STOP THEIR OPERATIONS THE SAFETY EVALUATION COULD BE PERFORMED. AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WOULD GRANT US AT THE READY TO DIRECT SUCH FACILITIES CEASE OPERATIONS. AND DISSECT THE CITY OF AB VALUATION IS PERFORMED. I THESE BUSINESS. WE HAVE THE NUMBER SIZE BUSINESS FROM A SMALL. MOM AND POP SHOPS LIKE ON A REPAIR SHOPS ARE HAVE TO REFINERIES WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION.

AND THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND IT -- BUT WE TO HAVE THE CONCERNWITH THAT ONE REMAINING ISSUE -- WERE BOTH WILL BE ABLE. TO RECONCILE IT TO MUTUAL SATISFACTION. ALL RIGHT LET'S CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING BRING IT BACK. TO MEMBERS QUESTIONS. WHERE IS THE FINE MONEY GO? WE TYPICALLY S. SPLIT THE FIND MANY IN IN NOT COOPER PROGRAM I DON'T ANTICIPATE THERE WILL BE ACTUALLY FINDS IT LEVY BY THE HEALTH OFFICES. THEY CAN ON SO THAT WITH THE COOPER PROGRAM LONG STANDING SPLIT FOR THE FIND LIVE IS HERE THIS ISN'T A BOUNTY PROGRAM BY ANY MEANS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ISSUING FINESAND PENALTIES. WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE CLOSURE IF THESE AN IMMINENT PUBLIC HEALTH RATE. AND JUST REMEMBER THE THAT AUTHORITIES ALREADY THERE FOR THE HEALTH OFFICES WE JUST ENSURING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS. OF REQUIRING THIS. TO THE HEALTH CLUBS TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE ENTIRE COUNTY JUST IT IS THIS ONE ISSUE. I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE FOLLOW UP IS IS IS THEIR DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHEN. THE EMERGENCY IS IMMINENT AND WHEN IT'S NOT EMANATE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT LAW HAS BEEN MORE OR LESS [inaudible] ESTABLISH. RIGHT THAT IS ESTABLISHED AT THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS AND SO CURRENTLY OUT OF AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE IF WE HAD HUNDREDS OF CASES. OF LOU WE DON'T NECESSARILY DECLARE A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ON THAT BUT IF WE AD A SINGLE CASE. OF SMALL POX WE WOULD DECLARE A NATIONAL YOU KNOW WORLD WIDE EMERGENCY SO CRITERIA ESTABLISHED DEPENDING ON OF THE A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN SO -- CURRENTLY YOU KNOW OUR BIOLOGICAL AND I KNOW THE CLOSES THE GAPS THAT THE COUPONS HAVE WITH EXISTING LAW WITH THE TSC THAT IS JUST. HELPFUL I GUESS. NO SAID EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE. INCIDENCES [inaudible] OKAY. THE ACTING CHAIR WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] NO. CAN I CAN. ALL RIGHT WE WILL WAIT FOR THE RETURN OF OTHER MEMBERS TO MOVE YOU HAVE ANYTHING THIS SAYING CLOSE. YES OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WAS JUST SAY AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED AS A RESULT OF A HEARING. HELD IN THE EAST SIDE OF LOS ANGELES. WITH SPEAKER RENDON ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER MIGUEL SANTIAGO AND MYSELF INCLUDED. WITH HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE EXITE CONTAMINATION ON THE EAST SIDE. THE FACT THAT EXCITED WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE WHILE EMITTING SUCH. TOXINS TO THE COMMUNITIES AND THE FACT THAT IN CORRELATION TO THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT HEALTH RECORDS OF OF KIDS WITH DISABILITIES MOTHERS WHO ARE PREGNANT AND WHO ARE EXPOSED THE FACT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXINS IN SUCH AS CONTROL HAS TAKEN YEARS TO ACTUALLY. IMPLEMENT ANY CHANGE THE FACT THAT OVER TEN THOUSAND HOMES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. OVER AND ONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP WHILE THE STATE HAS ALLOCATED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS STORE. FOR CLEAN UP IS JUST. INCREDIBLY ATROCIOUS AND YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO THIS BILL AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED IS AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS FIRST. WE CAN DO A LOT OF WORK HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WE'RE NOT ON THE GROUND AND WE HAVE TO ALLOW FOLKS TO DO THE WORK ON THE GROUND AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST UNABLE TO MOVE THIS BOAT. OKAY AT APPROPRIATE TIME WE'LL DO THAT THANK YOU WE'RE NOT GONNA TURN TO ITEM NUMBER ONE ON OUR CALENDAR THE BASIL CONVENTION THIS IS SENATE RESOLUTION. FORTY SEVEN ACTING SURE DOLLY I WILL. GOOD EVENING MEMBERS. THE GLOBAL TRANS BOUNDARY WASTE TRADE IS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY INCLUDES TOXIC WASTE. MANUFACTURING WASTE ELECTRONIC WASTE AND WELL AS RECOVERABLE MATERIALS FROM FINAL THE SPOILS. OR RECYCLING. AS THE INDUSTRY GREW IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND THE EIGHTIES THERE WERE SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE INCIDENTS OF WASTE DUMPING AND INCIDENCE OF AT C. AS WELL AS STORIES OF WEALTHY NATIONS DUMPING THEIR WASTE. I'M POOR NATIONS THE BASAL CONVENTION CONVENE IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AMIR THIRTY YEARS AGO TO PLACE PROTOCOLS ON INTERNATIONAL WAY STRAIGHT REQUIRING PRIVATE CONCERT. PRIOR CONSENT FROM THE RECEIVING CAMP. COUNTRY TO ACCEPT WASTE AND RECYCLED MATERIALS. WELL THE UNITED STATES SIGNED THE CONVENTION AND THESENATE APPROVED IT NINETEEN NINETY TWO CONGRESS THAT THE STATE HAS FAILED TO AMEND THE FEDERAL LAW TO CONFORM WITH THE CONVENTION. WHICH IS PREVENTING RATIFICATION AND PARTICIPATION IN THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES OR WAS NGUYEN. OFTEN HEAR COP IDENTIFICA SPEND AT THE CONVENTIONS PROTOCOL. BECAUSE WE HAVE FAILED TO RATIFY THE CONVENTION THE UNITED STATES IS HAD TO NEGOTIATE COSTLY AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO SEND AND RECEIVE OUR WASTE. MOST RECENT CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES HELD JUST. TWO MONTHS AGO IN MAY OF TWENTY NINETEEN ADDED CONTAMINATED IN MIXED PLASTIC WASTE TO THE CONVENTION PROTOCOLS. THIS RESOLUTION SR FORTY SEVEN STATES. PORT FOR THE BILL BASEL CONVENTION AND CALLS ON CONGRESS TO AMEND THE FEDERAL LAW TO ALLOW THE UNITED STATES TO FULLY RATIFY THE CONVENTION AND TAKE PART. IN THE CONFERENCE OF PARTIES. SENATE RESOLUTION FORTY SEVEN POINTS OUT THAT THE FAILURE TO RATIFY THE BASEL CONVENTION AFFECTS MANY CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AS THEY OFTEN DO BUSINESS IN AND WITH COUNTRIES THAT ARE BOUND BY THE CONVENTIONS WASTE PROTOCOLS. MANY CANNOT RE IMPORT PRECIOUS METALS MATERIALS FOR RECYCLING INTO NEW PRODUCTS. THEIR VOICE GOES ON HEARD IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES AT THE TABLE. CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS IN WASTE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING HAS BEEN HINDERED BY CHINA AS A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BàN WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY ON THE ON SOME PLASTICS AND OTHER RECYCLABLES. AND OUR PROGRESS WILL CONTINUE TO HIT NEW BARRIERS AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES STAYS OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL TREATY. SENATE RESOLUTION FORTY SEVEN ADS CALIFORNIA'S VOICE TO THIS IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL TREATY. THERE ARE SUPPORTERS. WE WANT ONE MORE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MARIE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION. JUST REALLY TWO POINTS REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE CENTER BRINGING THIS FORWARD. NUMBER. ONE THE THE THE POINT THAT THIS WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS. ACTIVELY AGREED TO WITH THIS IN. PLASTIC MIXED PLASTIC PLASTIC WASTE TO THIS IS THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE EXPORTING. ON PROCESS MIXED PLASTIC WASTE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE. THE CAPABILITY OF ACTUALLY AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. REMANUFACTURING THIS MATERIAL. THEY'RE USING LOW WAVE OF LOW WAGE LABOR. TO SORT THROUGH IT AND THEY'RE TAKING THE RESIDUAL PLASTIC AND THAT STUFF BUT THERE IS NO MARKET. FOR THEIR SIMPLY THROWING AWAY WHERE THEY'RE BURNING IT IN THEIR COUNTRIES AND WE ARE COUNTING IT AS RECYCLING CELL I APPRECIATE CAN BRING FORWARD THIS RESOLUTION IN ORDER TO KIND OF AGAIN. UNDERSCORE THAT POINT AND IDEALLY WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. CALIFORNIA COULD. SET ITS OWN COURSE WITH REGARD TO TRADE AGREEMENTS AS A CALM AS RICH AS RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENT WE CAN'T DO THAT. WE'RE DEPENDENT ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD. HAVE CALIFORNIA AT LEAST CALL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THIS ACTION VIRGIN AYE. MISTER ACTING CHAIR IS THE STAFF REPORT ABLY POINTS OUT. ALL THE THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS EVERYBODY HAS SIGNED ON TO THIS CONVENTION EXCEPT FOR THE UNITED STATES AND HAITI. AND I THINK THAT IT'S TIME FOR US TO STOP BEING OUT LIARS. AND TWENTY THE WORLD. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT STAFF. THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. AND I WILL BRING IT BACK YEAH. IF THERE WERE MOTION I WOULD URGE AND I'VE. SO I CAN ADD LIVE MISTER CHAIR IF YOU WANT ME TO ALONG CLOSE. I CAN RE READ THAT STATEMENT -- WITH THAT GO AHEAD IF YOU LIKE NOW NOW I'M DONE I'M DONE.

SENATOR -- ALLEN PLEASE YOU SEE WELL THANK YOU I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE OUT OF ORDER I AND I I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S -- I PATIENTS I WAS JUST PRESENTING OVER -- ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE I'M I AS YOU ME AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I AM A AUTHOR OF AN IDENTICAL -- BILL ON THE SENATE SIDE SEVERAL WE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD THIS BILL. IN THE PAST THAT IS SB FIFTY FOUR ON THE PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR OF ASSEMBLY SIZED VERSION AB TEN EIGHTY AND I AS A FAVOR TO THE THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR -- DECEMBER GONZALEZ I PRESENT THE BILL TO YOU TODAY. AS SHE'S ALREADY DONE SEATED US SO I JUST WANNA. FIRST EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBER AND SEND AND TAKE THIS EXTRAORDINARY COMMITTEE AND A HUMBLE CHAIR. FOR FOR ALL OF ITS WORK ON THIS ON THIS -- ON THIS ISSUE HI THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE IS AN ISSUE WE SPENT SOMETIME LOOKING AT MEMBERS WE HAD ALL HEARING ON THIS -- LOOKING AT THE CHALLENGES OF WASTE OF LITTER OF THE FACT THAT -- THAT OUR CITIES ARE NOW SPENDING CLOSE TO A BILLION CLOSE TO HALF LITTER CLEAN UP ALONE. THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS OF THE GUARDS TO WASTE REDUCTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE FOLKS IN CHINA WITH NATIONAL SORT POLICY DECIDED NOT TO TAKE ARE. RECYCLED MATERIALS ANYMORE AND SO SO MUCH OF WHAT WE WHAT WHAT WE WHAT WHAT WHAT I TO BE RECYCLED IS NOT GETTING RECYCLED IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURAL CHALLENGE IT'S A MARKET CHALLENGE. AND I WHAT WE'RE TRULY DO ACTUALLY UNLIKE SOME OF FOR OUR COLLEAGUES ATTEMPTS WERE REALLY IT YOU WHICH ARE WHAT YOUR ONE OFFICER VERY PRESCRIPTIVE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE WE'RE ACTUALLY. WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO TELL. OUR AGENCY CAL RESPECT. TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY WITH A CITIES WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT FOLKS. AND HOLLERS TO FIGURE OUT A STRATEGY. TO TO REFER TO REDUCE SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTE THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GETTING RID OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC. WE'RE JUST HELPING TO PROVIDE OLD OF A NUDGE SO THAT. THE THE PACKAGING THAT WE DO HAVE WILL BECOME MORE SUSTAINABLE -- TRULY RECYCLABLE AND WHEN I SAY RECYCLE BUT ONLY TECHNICALLY RECYCLING ALLOWED BUT RECYCLABLE AND RECYCLED IN REAL LIFE. YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF ASPECTS OF INDUSTRY THAT WILL WILL BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MEET THESE GOALS PRETTY EASILY -- BASICALLY WITH THE GUARDS THE FOLKS WHO WORK IN A PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THE ONES INTO USING THE PLASTICS. AREA ARE ACTUALLY HIGHLY RECYCLABLE -- BUT WE NEED TO KEEP PUSHING IN THIS AREA I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU HAVE SO MUCH PASSION SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. FROM OUR CITIES AND FROM OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE REALLY DROWNING RIGHT NOW -- IN WASTE WE USED TO BE ABLE TO WE WERE USED TO GET PAID FOR THE WASTE THAT WE WOULD GIVE AWAY AND NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING TO PAY. TO GO TO TO TO TO SEND OFFER CYCLE MATERIALS SO YOU WANT LET'S HEAR SOME FROM SOME OF THE ATTENTION IS OUR SUPPORTERS. WHO ARE HERE? PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ALAN MY NAME IS AMY WILL FROM I'M CALIFORNIA OCEAN POLICY MANAGER FOR THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS THE AQUARIUM STRONG SUPPORT BABY. TEN EIGHTY THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A MEANINGFUL GOAL AND COMPREHENSIVE BRING MY DRESSING THE GROWING PROBLEM OF PLASTIC POLLUTION ARE OCEAN AND WATERWAYS. AN INCREASING BODY OF RESEARCH IS SHOWING THAT MORE AND MORE PLASTIC IS MAKING ITS WAY FROM LAND TO SEE. IMPACTING THE HEALTH OF OUR OCEAN WILDLIFE. THAT'S BECAUSE IN ALMOST EVERY MARINE HABITAT ON EARTH EVEN ARE PROTECTED CALIFORNIA WATERS ARE NOT IMMUNE. RECENT GALLUP RECENT AQUARIAN RESEARCH FOUND PLASTIC PARTICLES. THE WATER COLUMN MONTEREY BAY. IN THE OCEAN SURFACE TO THE SEA FLOOR. I RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE PARTICLES ARE MADE OF THE SAME TYPES OF PLASTIC IN SINGLE USE CONSUMER. CONSUMER PRODUCTS. IN FACT THE MOST ABUNDANT TYPE OF PLASTIC WAS B. E. T. NUMBER ONE WHICH IS COMMONLY USED IN WATER BOTTLES. TAKE OUT CONTAINERS AND PRODUCT PACKAGING. IT IS CLEAR THAT ARE DISPOSABLE SINGLE USE PLASTIC SOCIETY IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE PROBLEM OF OCEAN PLASTICS SOLUTION. POLLUTION SOLUTIONS HERE WE ADOPT SOLUTIONS WE HAD UP HERE TO COME MODELS FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD AND NO OTHER STATE IS BETTER POSITIONED TO LEAD IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE PRIOR STATE AND FOR A PLANET. IT WILL HELP ACCELERATE INNOVATION AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WASTE GENERATED IN SINGLE USE PLASTIC. PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS AND NOTABLY THIS IS THE FIRST LEGISLATION ON THE ISSUE THAT ADDRESSES THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM. AT THE AQUARIUM WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT ALL HAVE IMPORTANT ROLES TO PLAY. THROUGHOUT OUR LONG HISTORY OF WORKING WITH INDUSTRY ON OCEAN CONSERVATION ISSUES WE'VE LEARNED THAT COLLECTIVE ACTION. TAKEN BY PLAYERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN IS CRUCIAL TO LASTING SUCCESS. THIS BILL WOULD HELP SET THE CONDITIONS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE. IF THERE'S ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT CAN DO THIS THAT CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND THE HEALTH OF OUR OCEAN COAST IS A MAJOR PART OF OUR SUCCESS. WE MUST MAKE SURE EACH ASSISTANT I DON'T BALLOT. THANK YOU NEXT. THE BRIEF HERE SO I WILL BE BRIEF -- WITH MARKETS TRYING UP COMMODITY PRICES IN THE TANK AN INCREASE IN PROCESSING COSTS. A RECYCLING PARADIGMS IN SHAMBLES AB TEN EIGHTY IS A VERY STRONG STARTING POINT HELPING CHANGE RECYCLING PARADIGM. BY REDUCING PRODUCTION. AND THE USE OF NON RECYCLABLE SINGLE USE PACKAGING CONTAINERS. WE BELIEVE THAT BY DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR IDENTIFYING SINGLE USE PAT PLASTIC PACKAGING. WAS UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND BY REQUIRING A FACE DOWN IN THE USE OF NON RECYCLABLE NON. YOU RE USABLE AND NON COMPOSTABLE SINGLE USE PACKAGING BY THE TEN TWENTY THIRTY THAT AB TEN EIGHTY WILL REDUCE RECYCLING CONTAMINATION. HELP IMPROVE THE VALUE OF THE MARK OF MARKET. AND OF TRULY RECYCLABLE COMMODITIES AND SPREAD SOME RESPONSIBILITY TO PACKAGING MANUFACTURES AND THUS HELP REDUCE RECYCLING COSTS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND RATEPAYERS. WE'RE JUST SUPPORT.

YES HELLO AND SALAS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT. RIGHT I'M LET'S BRING UP THE OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND IT'S A SPECIAL. TRIFECTA OF OPPOSITION THE SLEEVE [inaudible] AGREED [inaudible] LET'S HEAR. I GET AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TIM JUST A WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL -- LET ME FIRST OFF BY SAYING. WE HAVE MADE SOME PUBLIC STATEMENTS. THE INDUSTRY'S COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVING. VERY AGGRESSIVE -- STANDARDS FOR RECYCLABILITY COULD POSSIBILITY OF OF PLASTIC PACKAGING SO WE ARE IN ALIGNMENT -- WITH CENTER ALLEN SOMETHING AMERICANS OFFICES. LONG TERM VISION I THINK WHERE WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS. IS HOW THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND SOME OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE THERE IN THE BILL. IN A COUPLE OF AREAS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE IS. THE BILL'S. IN OUR READ A COMPLETE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TAKE OUR CYCLE TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS -- TO REACH THESE GOALS AND THAT MAKES US FRANKLY A LITTLE NERVOUS AS TO THE POWER THEY CAL RECYCLE HAVE. OVER THE PACKAGING INDUSTRY WHETHER OR NOT THE BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ARBITRARILY PICK AND CHOOSE WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE MARKET PLACE SAID -- RECYCLE CONTENT STANDARDS IN ALL THIS AUTHORITIES DELEGATED. OVER THE COUNTER CYCLE SO THAT. IS CERTAINLY. AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO RAISE IS THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BEFORE THE BILL OR SET ESTABLISHES SOME INTERIM BENCHMARKS. FOR PACKAGING RECYCLING RATES IN COMPOSTING RATES THAT MUCH MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED FROM CAL RECYCLE IN TERMS OF A VERY DETAILED SCOPING PLAN OF THE STATE'S EXISTING WASTE COLLECTION INFRASTRUCTURE. PROCESSING CAPABILITIES WHAT MAY BE NECESSARY. TO BUT MAYBE NEEDED IN TERMS OF UPGRADES TO THOSE TO THOSE TO THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET TO THESE TO THESE. TO THESE. BENCHMARKS THAT THE BILL ESTABLISHES SO WE THINK MUCH MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO HELP INFORM WHAT THOSE. INTERIM GOALS MAY BE TO GET TO TO GET TO THE 75% THRESHOLD. AND WE ALSO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THOSE STANDARDS. BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAME MAY COME ON THE MARKET PLACE IN TERMS OF PROCESSING THIS MATERIAL. SO. FOR INSTANCE ESTABLISHING A TWENTY FOUR AND A A PACKAGING MATERIAL MAY GET 219% BUT AS THE WAY THE BILL'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED THERE'S A CONDITION OF SALE IF YOU DON'T REACH 20% OF YOUR ME THE OFF THE MARKET PLACE. WHY I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SOME FLEXIBILITY? IN THAT WE ALSO THINK THAT. THE BILL NEEDS TO LOOK AT HOW TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE REGULATORY DUPLICATION THAT WE SEE COMING DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S CURRENTLY THE BOTTLE BILLS COMMITTEE KNOWS THERE'S CAL RECYCLING COMMENCE THE RIGID PLASTIC PACKAGING CONTAINER LAW. SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SINCE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE AVOID UNNECESSARY. REGULATORY DUPLICATION. WE'VE PUT TOGETHER SOME. COMPREHENSIVE AMENDMENTS OF SHARED WAS SENT ROUNDS FOLKS AND AND AND MACHINES ALSO SPOKE TO TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES. AND WE THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET. TO THE OBJECTIVE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND AT THE END OF REASONABLE AND REALISTIC FASHION. I WILL TOUCH ON ONE ONE ASPECT OF THE PROVISIONS THAT WE'VE SUGGESTED THAT I I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ANY OF THE OTHER FOLKS AND THE COALITION SUPPOSING THE BILL BUT WE HAVE SUGGESTED. A AN ADVANCE RECYCLING FEE. FOR SOME OF OUR PACKAGING PRODUCERS THOSE THAT ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE TAKE OUT FOOD SERVICE PACKAGING ARENA. THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY. HELD UP AS EXAMPLES OF MARINE DEBRIS AND LITTER WHICH WE THINK WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TOWARD HELPING. FINANCE SOME OF THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. IMPROVEMENTS TO LITTER ABATEMENT. PUBLIC EDUCATED ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THAT'S A THAT'S A A PROPOSAL TO BE PUT ON THE TABLE. I KNOW SENATOR ALLEN AND SOME AMERICANS ALSO PUTTING TOGETHER A PROCESS TO TALK THROUGH JUST SOME OF THESE ISSUES OVER THE SUMMER RECESS [inaudible] I THANK. IT'S A TAD CONCERNING THAT WE ARE AT THE LAST. POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING. SURROUNDS BILL WILL BE HEARD MONDAY IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. AND WE STILL THINK THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN NOW AND THE IN THE SESSION WHAT'S THE WEATHER NOT WE CAN DO THAT I DON'T KNOW BUT WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING IT. WE'VE LIKE I SAID SET SAT DOWN AND AND PROPOSED SOME SOME DETAIL AMENDMENTS. HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET THERE WERE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE BUT AS THE BILL'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED. WE STILL HAVE SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH WITH THE PROVISIONS OF AND MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU NEXT. MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS IN THREE MILLION ON BEHALF OF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION CONSUMER PACKAGED GOOD PRODUCERS ALWAYS SUPPORT THE INTENT OF AB TEN EIGHTY AS LONG AS IT ALIGNS WTH THE CONSUMER PACKAGING. GOODS -- UNIFIED GOALS OF ENHANCING. TAXI TO STAY ABILITY WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AS OF TODAY -- EVERYONE OF THE LARGEST TWENTY FIVE C. P. G.COMPANIES AS COMMITTED TO PRODUCING MORE RECYCLABLE COMPOSTABLE PACKAGING AND 80% HAVE ALREADY SET. A TWENTY THIRTY DEADLINE FOR THE PACKING TO BE FULLY RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE. HOWEVER THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE BILL CREATES A SYSTEM BY CONDITION OF SALE AS MENTIONED BY TIM. FOR THE MANUFACTURE WILL BEAR ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRODUCT WITHOUT ANY ABILITY TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM WHAT PROMOTE COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. ARE MANUFACTURERS CAN DESIGN FOR RECYCLABILITY IN COMPOSED ABILITY. CAN NOT DESIGNED FOR THE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY WASTE JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEIR INDIVIDUAL REQUIREMENTS. TO MAKE THIS WORK WE BELIEVE A LONG TERM WE NEED TO WORK ON THE DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL EXPLORE OFF RAMPS INVESTIGATE THE NEEDS OF THE WAY SYSTEM AND RECYCLING SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE. AND EXPLORE POSSIBLE TOOLS SUCH AS WASTE GENERATOR FEES WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN CONVERSATIONS ON THE PROCESS OF THIS BILL -- BUT AS OF TODAY WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. X.. AFTER THE CALVIN GROCERS ASSOCIATION -- ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS TO SEE. ALSO EMPHASIZE AND AND THANK THE SENATOR AND AS A MEMBER GONZALEZ BOTH AS WELL AS OUR STAFF -- FOR FOR ENGAGING IN REALLY GOOD DISCUSSIONS -- SPECIFICALLY -- ARE ISSUE THAT WANT TO KIND OF POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE AND AND TO FOLKS IS AS GROCERS -- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF LOCAL ORDINANCES ON THIS ISSUE AND AND IN OUR INDUSTRY IS IS ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF A LOT OF SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE FOR A BOTTOM LINE TO OUR CUSTOMERS APPRECIATE IT. THAT BEING SAID IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A STATEWIDE A REGIME FOR FOR THIS SORT OF OF OF OF THE PACKAGING AND RECYCLING IN AND WASTE. REDUCTION I'M IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE LEGIT YOU KEEP IN MIND THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR SOME SORT OF PRE EMPTION FOR LOCALS BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR COMMITMENT TO TO THIS PROJECT IS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT. MUCH LIKE WE DID WITH PLASTIC BAGS OF YEARS AGO TO PROVIDE A STATEWIDE BILL -- TO TO PREVENT -- THE SORT OF PATCHWORK QUILT OF OF ORDINANCES THAT WE FACE WHICH IS WHY THE GROWTH SUPPORTED THE THE SINGER'S PLASTIC BAG WE WOULD SIMPLY ASK FOR THE SAME SORT OF POLICY CONSIDERATION TO SAY THAT -- IF WE COMMIT TO THIS AND AND BUY INTO THIS. YOU KNOW WE DON'T COME BACK AFTER WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND AND IS A MEMBER TO HAVE LOCALS COME IN AND AND YOU KNOW AN ACTOR BUT TOWARDS IS THAT THAT. OUR UNACHIEVABLE -- INST SOME INSTANCES SO THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THAT'S ABOUT IT MARIN. ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN. IN OPPOSITION OF AB. TEN EIGHTY THANK YOU -- TIME JACOB ON BEHALF OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL CALIFORNIA -- CHAIR THE PERSPECTIVES -- JUST VOICED THANK YOU. AND YOU HAVE BEEN ON BEHALF OF AMERICA AND WE REPRESENT THE TAXI MANUFACTURES CONSUMER GOOD COMPANIES AND SOME OF THE HOLLERS. OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED WANT TO STRESS THAT WE HOPE THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS PROCESS DOES RESULT IN SOME SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS IN THE SHORT TIME THAT WE HAVE LEFT. I WANT TO STRESS THAT WE ALSO HAVE OFFERED A PROPOSAL AND AND SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF GETTING TO SOME GOALS WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM SEE SOME ALIGNMENT WITH SOME OF THE EUROPEAN. ACTING DIRECTOR OF GOALS AND AND USING THAT AS A BEGINNING STEP I JUST APPRECIATE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE PROCESS. WHEN ENCOURAGED -- TO THAT THAT THE COMMITTEE AND AT THAT THE SPONSORS CONSIDER TECHNOLOGICAL COMMERCIAL VISIBILITY BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL. IF WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD IN THIS AREA THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN RESTRICT HIS OF THE CALIFORNIA FOOD PRODUCERS AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF A MOVING FORWARD I'M CONCERNED ABOUT FOOD SAFETY ISSUES CONCERNED ABOUT I'M REPORTING AND CRADLE TO GRAVE -- IN JUST AGAIN LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING ON NARROWING THE DEFINITIONS IN THERE IN THE SCOPE THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CANNOT HAVE SOME SIX AT THE END OF THE PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON COOKING HOURS ON BEHALF HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WITH IMPOSE LAST MINUTE POSITION THANK YOU. CENTER JOE ACTOR MEMBERS ON BEHALF THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION -- WE AGREE WITH THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS OF YOUR BILL -- WE BELIEVE WE CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. BUT WE THINK WE NEED A DEFINITELY MORE STRUCTURE AND DIRECTION BEFORE WE PUT THIS OVER TO CAL RECYCLE. HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AFTER SHE GERINGER WITH AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA ALSO RESPECTFULLY AND OPPOSITION FOR SOME OF THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED AND HOPE TO WORK DURING THE SUMMER RECESS AND NOT AROUND IN THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE FOOD SAFETY SCOPE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THANK YOU. AT WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OPPOSES BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS -- DURING THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THANKS. I AM KEVIN MESSNER WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF HOME APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS WANT TO BRING A LITTLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON APPLIANCES THAT ARE DELIVERED TO THE HOME. A REFRIGERATOR. WAY THOSE ARE SOLD FOR THE US AND CANADA THERE ARE SOLD FROM THE FACTORY TO A DISTRIBUTOR REGIONAL DISTRIBUTOR A LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR THEN TO A U. S. NATIONAL US CANADA. RETAILER. AND THEN THEY ARE DELIVERED TO THE HOME. SO THEIR REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL THAT REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURE TO PROVIDE HOW MUCH IS SOUL WHAT QUANTITY IS SOLD IN THE STATE. AND THEN WITH THE RECYCLING RATES ARE THEY HAVE THEY ARE COULD PROTECT THEIR MANY STEPS BEHIND. ON THE ON THE STREAM OF COMMERCE ON WAY TO DO THAT SO THEY CAN'T PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION I PROBABLY DON'T KNOW IT SO THE BILL IS CREATING REQUIREMENTS FOR MANUFACTURERS THAT. REALLY CANNOT BE MATT AS ONE OF THERE ARE SOME TECHNICAL THINGS THAT COULD BE RESOLVED TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT WHAT'S REQUIRED. CAN BE GIVEN BY THE MANUFACTURERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU DON KHAKI MCCUE CAP CAN ASSOCIATES ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION C. M. T. A. AS WELL AS THE DISTILLED SPIRITS COUNCIL ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE REASONS STATED BUT LOOK FORWARD TO THE PARTICIPATING AND MYSTICAL. THANK YOU. MAYBE WE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. OKAY LET'S CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING BRING IT BACKTO ME MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. MISSED BUT SEVEN CENTER BATES HAVE QUIT ANY QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR ON TEN AB. ALL RIGHT YOU MAY CLOSE. WELL I REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL THE THE INPUT FROM FROM EVERYBODY WEEK I  ACTUALLY WOULD PARTICIPATE IN A STAKEHOLDER MEETING MYSELF -- LAST WEEK AND AND THERE WILL BE ROBUST DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING WITH ALL THE VARIOUS FOLKS FROM THE ADVOCACY SIDE FROM THE HOLLERS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FROM THEIR SECOND COMMUNITY AND THEN FROM INDUSTRY -- AND WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING REALLY HARD OVER THE NEXT -- MOTHER. TO TO TO TRY TO PULL TOGETHER FEASIBLE PLAN I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE YOU KNOW THAT THEIR FOLKS HERE WHO ARE STRETCHING AND THEY'VE COME UP AND THEY SAID YOU KNOW OF WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION WE ACTUALLY NEED TO TAKE DRAMATIC STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION. THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HAD A CRAFT THOSE DETAILS AND THAT'S WHAT THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT YOU'VE. HEARD ALLUDED TO I REPEATEDLY IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT. GETTING A HANDLE ON OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT CRISIS -- PROVIDING RELIEF FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND IN THE END OF THE DAY AND THIS IS ONE THING I SAID TO THE STAKEHOLDERS ONLY MATT. HELPING TO CRAFT A A REALLY VIABLE. SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM THAT CAN BE SOLD AND SCALED. TO THE REST THE WORLD. AND WHAT I SAID EVERYBODY LAST WEEK WAS THAT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE I WOULD CONSIDER THIS WHOLE EFFORT TO HAVE BEEN A FAILURE. IF WE DON'T CROSS SOMETHING THAT -- THAT THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS OTHER STATES OTHER NATIONS WANT TO REPLICATE -- AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS IF WE DO SOMETHING THAT IS BOTH MEANINGFUL IN TERMS OF REAL WASTE REDUCTION. AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. I BECAUSE OF THE JURISDICTIONS ARE GOING TO DO IT IF THEY SEE THISIS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HARM THEIR ECONOMIES BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY WE CAN BE WE HAVE THE MOST GREEN POLICIES IN THE WORLD BUT IF WE'RE NOT ABLE. TO GET OTHER FOLKS TO ADOPT THESE PLICIES ARE WE WON'T HAVE REALLY MADE IT THE KIND OF DIFFERENCE WE NEED TO MAKE FOR OUR CHILDREN -- AND AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS ARE WE HAVE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- BECAUSE THE THE CURRENT PACE THE CURRENT. THE CURRENT. APPROACH IS IS IS FINALLY AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK REBEL. HELD. PROCEDURALLY I'M. VERY QUICKLY I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT WHETHER US. SENATOR ALLEN YOU RESPONDED IN TERMS OF CAL RECYCLE HAVING SO MUCH OF FORTY IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. I BELIEVE WHICH IS STARTING WHEN I LEFT I THINK ONE OF THE THOSE OPPOSING IT ON BASICALLY A LOT OF THE CONCERN IF THERE. WHICH YOU ARE WORKING ON ABOUT ALSO THAT ARE YEAH NO THAT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW. I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US THAT THERE BE. THIS NOT JUST BE. I'M SENT A GREAT STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES THE DON KNAPP YEAH WE HAVE TEETH -- BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF BEEN RAISING THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS GONNA BE. A GRAPPLED WITH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. I JUST THINK THAT HAS THE LEGISLATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES AROUND PEOPLE WE KEEP THE PEOPLE INVOLVED HERE WHEN YOU INCENTIVIZE THEM WHICH WE CAN DO WITH VERSUS THE BUREAUCRACY BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. IT WILL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL SO I WANT US TO HAVE CONTINUE TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN NOW. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO RESISTANT TO GOVERNMENT TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO -- I DON'T KNOW I GUESS THEY DON'T LIKE US TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO EITHER BUT MAYBE WE DEAL WITH A SOFTER. YOU KNOW FIVE TO LIE TO OURSELVES BUT ANYWAY I JUST WANT TO HAVE THAT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. TOO SAM CENTER BATES I APOLOGIZE YOUR THE VICE JUST I CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE LET ME HAVE THE GAVEL TO YOU AND DOES IT MAKE YOU IS THE PRESIDING OFFICER ON SB. TEN EIGHTY I MOVED THE BILL AS GREAT.
