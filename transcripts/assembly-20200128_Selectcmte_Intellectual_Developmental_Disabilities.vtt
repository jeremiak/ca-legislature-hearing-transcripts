00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.142
REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. IT IS

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:53.345
A VALID REPRESENTATION OF THE

00:26:53.411 --> 00:26:55.547
OPINIONS AND THOUGHTS OF THOSE

00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:57.215
WHO DID COMPLETE THE SURVEY.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.583
CONVENIENCE SAMPLING RESULTS

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.418
MAKE US AWARE OF WHAT IS

00:27:00.485 --> 00:27:02.620
IMPORTANT TO SURVEY RESPONDENTS

00:27:02.687 --> 00:27:04.122
AND CAN OFFER GUIDANCE AS TO

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:05.824
WHAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO THE

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.993
LARGER POPULATION. THERE WERE A

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.761
TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:11.563
TWO RESPONSES TO THE SURVEY.

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:13.398
AND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:16.801
OR ABOUT 35% COMPLETED ALL OF

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:19.004
THE QUANTIFIABLE QUESTIONS. WE

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.406
ANALYZED ONLY THOSE TWO HUNDRED

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:22.640
AND THIRTY FIVE RESPONSES FOR

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:24.609
THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES FOR

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:26.711
THREE REASONS. ONE BECAUSE

00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:28.279
DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WAS NOT

00:27:28.346 --> 00:27:30.015
COLLECTED WE COULD NOT USE

00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:32.283
ADDITIONAL METHODS TO PREDICT

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:35.186
THE MISSING DATA. TO RESULTS

00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:36.287
ARE OFTEN IN RELATION TO ONE

00:27:36.354 --> 00:27:37.956
ANOTHER. OFTEN WHEN VIEWING

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.791
STATISTICAL RESULTS COMPARISONS

00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:41.826
ARE MADE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:43.395
PEOPLE'S ANSWERS TO SIMILAR

00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:45.897
QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE ASKING

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:46.998
ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE TO RANK

00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:48.600
EXPERIENCE WITH CASE WORKERS

00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:49.934
BUT ASKING ANOTHER GROUP OF

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:51.302
PEOPLE TO SAY HOW LONG IT

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:53.872
TAKES. A CARE GIVER TO RETURN A

00:27:53.938 --> 00:27:56.207
CALL IS NOT COMPARABLE. A

00:27:56.274 --> 00:27:57.876
READER MIGHT MISS THAT IT IS

00:27:57.942 --> 00:27:58.743
TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.512
BEING COMPARED AND MAKING A RUN

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:02.914
ITS CONCLUSION. THREE IN

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:04.382
ADDITION COMPARING SATISFACTION

WANT TO SEE MORE OF. THERE WERE

00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:11.643
FOUR POSITIVE THEMES THAT

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:13.811
EMERGED FROM THE ANALYSIS.

GETTING A DIAGNOSIS FOR THEIR

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:32.764

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:43.708
OVERWHELMING FOR ME STRUGGLING

DISORDERS SINCE THE AGE OF

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:57.121
NINE. SO THE DIAGNOSIS REALLY

00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:58.756
HELPS TO UNDERSTAND HER

00:30:58.823 --> 00:31:00.725
INABILITY TO FUNCTION IN LIFE.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:13.731
RESPONDENTS BELIEVE REGIONAL

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:15.266

GIVEN INCORRECT INFORMATION OR

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:25.209
LEADS TO THAT SOME STAFF HAVE

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:26.678
PURPOSELY NOT GIVEN THEM THE

00:32:26.744 --> 00:32:28.713

SPECIFIC AND WROTE THINGS SUCH

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:42.527

VENDORS SHOULD BE PAID MORE

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.885
THIS PERSON WROTE. IT IS

00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:42.053
IMPERATIVE THAT FUNDING IS

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.355
INCREASED FOR ALL VENDORS

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:45.390
INVOLVED WITH THE DISABILITY

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.125
COMMUNITY WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

WE COULD BE DOING FOR SPECIAL

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:52.497
LEFT ONCE. THEN THERE ARE

00:33:52.563 --> 00:33:54.098
FAMILIES TO GET NOTHING BECAUSE

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:55.066
THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THE

REGIONAL CENTERS AND THEIR

00:33:58.069 --> 00:34:01.072
SERVICES. THE THIRD THEME IS

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:01.973
THAT PAYMENTS AND FUNDING

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:04.842

MONEY OR FUNDING COULD HELP AND

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:24.195
WROTE IT IS NOT MY IMPRESSION

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:25.863
THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER IS THE

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:28.199
PROBLEM WHERE THERE ARE ISSUES

00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:29.434
BUT THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.402
MONEY IN THE SYSTEM. PROGRAMS

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.070
THAT CLOSED AFTER ALL THE

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:33.971
BUDGET CUTS HAVE NOT BEEN

00:34:34.038 --> 00:34:36.407
REPLACED AND THERE ARE JUST NOT

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:38.075
ENOUGH OPENINGS FOR EVERYONE

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:41.579
WHO HAS NEEDS. THE FOUR THEME.

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.947
IS THAT RESPONDENTS WROTE THAT

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:44.315
REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE

PROVIDERS SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:06.571
AT LENGTH I KEEP IT SHOR. THE

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:07.905
REGIONAL CENTER DEMONSTRATES A

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:09.707
DISREGARD FOR CLIENTS RIGHTS

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.509

IS TIME FOR REFORM. AND THE

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:26.057
FIFTEEN IS THAT RESPONDENTS

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:28.559
BELIEVE A ACCESS TO SERVICES

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:30.361

ALTHOUGH OVER THE LAST TEN

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:25.836

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:28.772
IMPROVEMENT. IN MY EXPERIENCE

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:31.175
HOWEVER FOR THE HUNDRED PLUS

00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:33.844

COUSINS BROTHERS CHILD I GO

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:44.655
JUST TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:46.724
UNIVERSE THAT THE ORIGINAL

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.193
DIAGNOSIS WAS NOT CORRECT. THEY

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:51.061
DON'T HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE.

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:52.730
THEY DON'T KNOW WHO TO CALL MR

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:55.366
BUT NAY- IT USED TO BE THAT WE

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:56.834
HAD ADVOCATES AT THE AREA

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.636
BOARDS. WHO WOULD COME IN AND

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:01.271
STEP IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:04.675
THAT NO LONGER IS AVAILABLE- IF

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:06.310
I WERE YOU KNOW IF I WERE TO

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:09.513
SAY. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE-

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.682
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS THE

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:13.484
COMMUNICATION IS ABSOLUTELY

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:15.719
KEY. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.421
WATCHDOG THESE ARE STILL NON

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:18.722
PROFITS PROVIDING STATE

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:20.958
SERVICES. AND THAT PIECE IS

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:23.494
MISSING. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.929
BETTER LINKAGE BETWEEN. SCHOOL

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:29.466
BOARDS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. POLICY

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:33.804
IN EDUCATION AND POLICY IN THE

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:37.041
ID DE AREA BECAUSE BECAUSE-

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:38.575
WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS I SEEM THAN

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:39.877
ANY. IS SCHOOL SAYING THE

00:44:39.943 --> 00:44:40.844
REGIONAL CENTERS AND OF THAT

00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:41.712
AND THEN THE REGIONAL SO IS NO

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:43.614
THIS. IN CHARGE OF THAT. AND

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.649
DURING THAT TIME THAT CHILD IS

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:47.918
LOSING SERVICES AND LOSING A

00:44:47.985 --> 00:44:50.154
CHANCE. TO BE A PRODUCTIVE

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.722
MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY IN THE

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:53.390
ONLY STATE WITH AN ENTITLEMENT

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:54.091
FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:57.428
DISABILITIES. SO I WOULD- AGAIN

00:44:57.494 --> 00:44:58.929
REITERATE EVERYTHING WE'VE

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:00.998
HEARD FROM FROM THE SURVEY BUT

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:03.734
ALSO LOOK TO A WAY TO RESOLVE

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:05.769
THIS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY'S

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:07.571
GETTING. A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:08.972
SERVICES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:10.874
COMMUNICATION I'M SORRY I'M

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:12.576
QUITE SAVVY THE LOT THE WEBSITE

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:15.913
IS UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S UNUSABLE

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:16.613
IT DOESN'T HELP YOU AND YOU

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.650

A REGIONAL CENTER PERSON

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:23.454
AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.355
IN GENERAL WOULD BE HUGE TO

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:27.691
CHECK THEM ON WHEN THEY CLAIM

00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:29.626
THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S THAT

00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:31.929
BELONGS. OUT WITH THE DISTRICT

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:34.364

DEALING WITH AND IT IS THE MOST

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.877
THING THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH.

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:49.079
AND IT IS THE EASIEST PLACE FOR

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:51.081
KIDS TO GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:52.316
BECAUSE EVERYTHING SEEMS

00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:54.818
ACADEMIC OR EVERYTHING SEEMS.

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:56.286

HERE TODAY. AT TWENTY SEVEN IS

NOW FINDING ITS WAY INTO THE

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.862
WORLD. ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT FOR

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:15.565
LACK OF TRYING. I'VE SAID FOR

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:16.566
THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS THE

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:17.634
WORST THING I EVER DID AS A

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.736
MOTHER WAS TO MOVE MY FAMILY

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:20.336
FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY TO SOLANO

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:23.640
COUNTY. WHY BECAUSE AS SOON AS

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:25.074
YOU CROSS THE BRIDGE SERVICES

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.743
ARE DIMINISHED YOUR SUPPORT

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:28.711
GOES DOWN 50% RESOURCES ARE

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:30.947
DOWN 50% AND ALTHOUGH SOME

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:31.915
WOULD SAY THAT IT'S A GOOD

00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:33.249
THING THAT ALL REGIONAL CENTERS

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:35.051
DO NOT RUN THE SAME WAY I

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.986
DISAGREE THE FOUNDATION OF ALL

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:38.388
REGIONAL CENTERS SHOULD BE

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:40.290
EXACTLY THE SAME AND IF ONE

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:41.558
CENTER HAS AN APPROVED VENDOR

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:43.359
THAT COMPRISED SERVICES THAT

00:57:43.426 --> 00:57:44.460
WOULD BENEFIT OUR SONS AND

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:46.329
DAUGHTERS AND ALL CENTER SHOULD

00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:48.698
ALLOW THAT WITH THAT VENDOR TO

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:49.599
BE APPROVED WITH LITTLE TO NO

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.734
ADDITIONAL STOPS. I HAVE NOT

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.970
SEEN THAT FROM MY PERSONAL

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.705
EXPERIENCE. ONCE WE MOVED FROM

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:57.674
ALAMEDA COUNTY TO SOLANO IT

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.209
TOOK A YEAR TO GET A

00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:03.012
COORDINATOR ASSIGNED TO US.

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:04.447
ONCE A SIGN TO US OUR

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:05.348
COORDINATOR STAYED WITH US

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:08.184
THROUGH DORIAN'S JUNIOR YEAR AT

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.653
LEAST I THINK THAT WAS AT. I

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.622
CAN'T REMEMBER BECAUSE DORIAN'S

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:14.290
COORDINATOR WENT AND MY A AT

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:16.492
THAT TIME IN OUR LIVES. AND I

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:17.493
DID NOT KNOW THAT HE HAD

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.161
RETIRED FROM THE REGIONAL

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:19.896
CENTER UNTIL I SAW MATTER LOCAL

00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:22.265
SAFEWAY. ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:23.633
MONTHS AFTER THAT WE MET HIS

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.535
NEW COORDINATOR. WE MET WITH

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:26.903
HER ONE TIME ATTEMPTED TO DO A

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:29.172
FOLLOW UP. SHE WAS NO LONGER

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:31.941
RETURNING MY CALLS WHY BECAUSE

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:32.575
SHE WAS NO LONGER EMPLOYED WITH

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:34.978
THE REGIONAL CENTER. NEW

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:37.280
COORDINATOR NEW MEETING FOLLOW

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.148
UP WITHIN OUR AGREED UPON AND A

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:40.416
GREAT AMOUNT OF TIME OF THREE

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:42.585
MONTHS AND AGAIN NO COORDINATOR

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:45.521
TO BE FOUND I LEFT MESSAGES AND

00:58:45.588 --> 00:58:47.557
AFTER AWHILE OF TRYING I CALLED

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:49.559
THE SUPERVISOR AND AT THAT TIME

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:51.194
I WAS TOLD BY THE SUPERVISOR IT

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:52.662
WAS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:54.464
NOTIFY THE CLIENTS WHEN A

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.299
COORDINATOR HAS LEFT AND IT WAS

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.800
THE CLIENT THAT NEEDED TO CALL

00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:59.569
THE REGIONAL CENTER. WHICH IS

00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:01.237
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:04.407
TRYING TO DO. I CAN'T SAY. THIS

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:06.042
HAS CHANGED WITH THE MOST

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:07.777
RECENT COORDINATOR CHANGE FOR

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:09.913
DORIAN WE WERE GIVEN NOTICE BY

00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:11.614
BOTH THE OUTGOING COORDINATOR

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.182
AND HIS NEW COORDINATOR.

00:59:13.249 --> 00:59:15.084
UNFORTUNATELY THROUGH ALL OF

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:17.220
THE CHANGES THEY STILL CAN'T

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:21.157
SEE HIS NAME PROPERLY.

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:25.395
THROUGHOUT DORIAN'S. YEARS

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:26.529
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:28.064
BEHAVIOR THERAPY FOR AND WHEN

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:29.799
IT WAS NEEDED HOWEVER THE OLDER

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:31.935
HE BECAME HIS NEEDS ALSO

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:34.103
CHANGED HE NEEDED MORE

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:34.871
SOCIALIZATION BECAUSE HE WASN'T

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:37.373
GETTING AT WE ASK FOR RESOURCES

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.841
AND WAS GIVEN AN OUTDATED

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:41.210
RESOURCE SHEET. WE FOUND OUT

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:41.778
THAT MOST OF THOSE

00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:43.346
ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE WERE

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:44.948
OUT THERE THAT WERE GIVEN TO US

00:59:45.014 --> 00:59:46.649
FOR EITHER OUT OF BUSINESS OR

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:48.985
DIDN'T FIT. MY SON'S NEEDS

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:50.553
COORDINATOR AT THAT TIME THIS

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.221
WAS MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:54.324
HAD SUGGESTED ACCOUNT. I TRIED

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.892
TO ASK FOR MORE PRO AND MORE

00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:57.760
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

00:59:57.827 --> 00:59:58.861
ACCORDING TO REALLY DIDN'T KNOW

00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.563
TOO MUCH ABOUT IT BUT INSISTED

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.532
THAT IT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:04.233
THING FOR DURING TO ATTEND. IT

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.003
WASN'T. IN THREE SHORT DAYS

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.138
DINES BEHAVIOR REGRESSED. I

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.506
STARTED RECEIVING CALLS THAT

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:11.874
DURING AN WAS NOT LOOKING THE

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.943
BATHROOM DOORS AND THE FORCE

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.445
AND CRAWLING ON THE GROUND AND

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:15.979
TAKING HIS CLOTHES OFF AT

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:19.015
SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH THIS HAPPENED

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.383
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I BRING IT UP

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.417
BECAUSE SOME THINGS HAVE NOT

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:23.453
CHANGED. I FEEL THE COORDINATOR

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:24.754
SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.289
WITH THE PROGRAMS THEY'RE

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:27.957
REFERRING CLIENTS TO. HANDING

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:29.659
SOMEONE A PIECE OF PAPER

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.361
DOESN'T ALWAYS HELP I GET IT I

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:32.495
UNDERSTAND IT'S ALSO THE

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:34.630
PARENTS RESPONSIBILITY TO DO

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:36.532
SOME OF THE RESEARCH AS WELL.

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:37.867
HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT IF

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.135
SOMEONE AT THE CENTER HAD DONE

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:41.304
A SITE VISIT. AND MAKE NOTES IN

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:43.139
THE SYSTEM I BELIEVE THAT THEY

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:45.008
MAY HAVE KNOWN THAT MY SON WAS

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:47.110
NOT A FIT. FOR THIS PROGRAM.

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:48.378
THIS WILL ALSO GO ALONG WITH

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.380
WORK SITES AS WELL. DURING THIS

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:51.581
FINALLY MADE THE DECISION THAT

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.316
HE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO WORK SO

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:54.817
WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIM TO

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:58.955
GET STARTED. A PROGRAM CALLED-GONE FOR GOOD. IT TOOK ABOUT

01:00:59.022 --> 01:00:59.789
TWO MONTHS FOR US TO GET

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.391
STARTED. ALTHOUGH ANOTHER

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:02.625
CLIENT OF THE REGIONAL START

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.127
CENTER STARTED THEIR PROGRESS

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.895
AFTER US IT ONLY TOOK THEM

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.397
THREE WEEKS TO BEGAN WHEN IT

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:09.999
TOOK US MORE THAN TWO. WE WERE

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:11.100
TOLD THAT DORIAN WHICH SHOT OF

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.969
SOMEONE BEFORE HE STARTED. AND

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:14.303
WOULD HAVE TO AND I WOULD HAVE

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.105
TO STAY ON SITE AND STARRING

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.074
WAS NOT AN EMPLOYEE. THE

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:19.675
DOWNSIDE DURING TO NOT SHADOW

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.544
ANY WHEN YOU WATCH TELEVISION

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.212
FOR THREE HOURS. WELL HE WAS

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:24.280
WATCHING TV I WAS IN THE

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.416
LIBRARY. AND I WAS WATCHING

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:29.252
INDIVIDUAL SLEEP AT THE TABLE-

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:30.319
AND INDIVIDUALS WALKING THE

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:32.388
HALLWAY FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS.

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:33.790
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WAS ON THEIR

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:36.526
PHONE- WITH NO WHEN ENGAGING

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.494
ARE CHECKING ON THEM AND THIS

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:40.430
WENT ON FOR A FEW HOURS. DORIAN

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:41.864
CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME HE WAS

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.833
BORED WITH WATCHING TV. AND

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.535
THAT HE WANTED TO SHOT OF

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:48.004
SOMEONE. I ASKED THE WORKER AND

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:49.372
SHE SAID THERE WAS NO SUCH

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:51.174
THING AS SHADOWING. AND THAT

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.341
DURING COULD GOING TO THE ART

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.444
ROOM OR PLAY GAMES THAT'S NOT

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.345
WHAT HE WAS THERE FOR. ALTHOUGH

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:58.681
WE WERE HESITANT WHEN WE DID

01:01:58.748 --> 01:01:59.649
MOVE FORWARD WITH GONE FOR

01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:02.351
GOOD. DIANE WAS THERE TO WORK

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:04.520
AND IN THE- FIRST ONE AND A

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:06.722
HALF MONTHS THAT HE WAS THERE

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:09.058
HE ONLY WORKS FOR DAYS. MOST

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.460
DAYS HE WAS PICKED UP LATE AT

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:11.427
TIMES HE WASN'T PICKED UP AT

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:13.496
ALL I TOLD THIS TO HIS REGIONAL

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.198
CENTER COORDINATOR AND I TOLD

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:15.998
HER THAT I WANTED TO PLACE A

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.301
COMPLAINT. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:19.902
THREE MONTHS LATER WHEN WE HAD

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.305
TO SEE HER. DID SHE ACTUALLY

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.774
GIVE ME A FORM TO COMPLETE. IF

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.709
I NEEDED TO FILL OUT A FORM.

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:27.910
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:30.012
ME. THE DAY THAT I CALLED. AND

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:32.915
SAID THERE WERE ISSUES. WE TRY

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.150
TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE FOR

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:35.885
DURING AND IS VERY VOCAL AND

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.520
VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT HE

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.022
DOES NOT WANT TO DO. HE TOLD US

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.425
TO IS COORDINATOR NO JANITORIAL

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.093
NO LANDSCAPING NO SUB MINIMUM

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.163
WAGE. SHE SUGGESTED PRIDE I

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.031
REMINDED HER THAT HE DID NOT

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:50.333
WANT TO DO THE TYPES OF JOBS

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:53.336
THAT PRIDE OFFERED. SHE SAID

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:53.936
THEY HAD OTHER OPTIONS IN THE

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:56.038
COMMUNITY. SO AGAINST HER

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.039
BETTER JUDGMENT WE WENT AHEAD

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:58.708
AND WENT TO PRIDE. AND THE

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.476
FIRST THING THAT WE WERE TOLD

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.478
THAT DARIEN COULD DO. WITH

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.046
LANDSCAPING OR CONCERTS

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:07.517
CUSTODIAL WORK. DORIAN SAID

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:08.951
THAT HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:11.387
EITHER OF THOSE. THEY THEN

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.156
OFFERED TO WORK IN THE PRIDE

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.557
WHERE HOUSE MAKING THREE

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:15.191
DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWO CENTS AN

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:17.593
HOUR. HIS COORDINATOR DID NOT

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:21.264
LISTEN TO US. IN BOTH INSTANCES

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.031
WE COULD HAVE SAVE TIME AND

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:24.066
ENERGY IF SHE HAD LISTENED TO

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:26.536
SOMEONE FROM FROM US AND IF THE

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:27.703
REGIONAL CENTER HAD MADE

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.640
PERIODIC SITE VISITS TO THESE

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:33.543
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. WE JUMP

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.144
OVER FOR DORIAN'S CONTINUE NEED

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:37.713
FOR SOCIALIZATION. I DRIVE MY

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.882
SON BETWEEN FREMONT ARANDA SAN

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:42.618
FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO DAVIS TO

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:43.319
FIND YOUR SUPPORT AND SOCIAL

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:46.222
GROUPS BECAUSE HIS COORDINATOR

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:48.357
HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S AVAILABLE.

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:49.792
THE LAST STRAW WAS WITH HIS A

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.227
RENDER GROUP WHICH COSTS NINETY

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:52.562
DOLLARS FOR AN HOUR AND TEN

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:56.098
MINUTES OF PEER SUPPORT. THEY

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:56.866
WENT ON BREAK THE ORGANIZER

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:58.601
CALLED AND SAID THAT THE GROUP

01:03:58.668 --> 01:03:59.202
WAS GOING TO HANG OUT AT THE

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.670
FOOD TRUCKS HAD DINNER AND BE

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.705
WITH THEIR FRIENDS. WE THOUGHT

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:04.307
THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA AND TELL

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.375
THE ORGANIZER SAID THAT DORIAN

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.743
COULD PAY THE AID NINETY

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.912
DOLLARS. I THOUGHT THAT WAS

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:11.647
CREEK KIND OF CRAZY. THAT MY

01:04:11.714 --> 01:04:13.182
SON WOULD PAY NINETY DOLLARS TO

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:14.951
HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS AT A FOOD

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:19.021
TRUCK. THIS ORGANIZATION IS NOT

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.390
VENDOR AS WITH REGIONAL CENTER.

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:22.758
SO THAT MONEY THAT DORIAN

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:25.127
SPENDS IS HIS OWN PERSONAL

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.996
MONEY AND IT'S HALF OF HIS

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:31.167
SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME. PRESS

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:32.535
THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW AND IT

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.103
WAS THAT MOMENT THAT DURING AND

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.471
I DECIDED TO START OUR OWN

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.139
GROUP CALLED FOUND IT WHERE WE

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.541
CAN PROVIDE PEER SUPPORT AND

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:39.976
SOCIALIZATION IN OUR OWN

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.545
COMMUNITY. OTHERS IS NOT A

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.080
PLAGUE BUT IT IS A VIABLE SORT

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.715
RESOURCE FOR GUYS AND GALS AND

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.283
IT DOESN'T COST ANY MONEY FOR

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.485
ANYONE TO ATTEND. WE'VE INVITED

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.287
DURING ITS COORDINATOR TO OUR

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:51.921
MEETINGS AND SHE'S NEVER

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:54.290
ATTENDED. YET ANOTHER CLIENTS

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:55.458
COORDINATOR HAS ATTENDED A

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.460
COMMUNITY MEETING. I DON'T

01:04:57.526 --> 01:04:59.028
UNDERSTAND WHILE ONE WOULD DO

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:01.897
WITH THAT FOR THEIR CLIENT. OUR

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:04.166
COORDINATOR WOULDN'T DO IT FOR

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.235
HER CLIENT. BEING THAT HE'S THE

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:06.902
ONE THAT STARTED THIS

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:09.105
ORGANIZATION AND SOMETHING HE'S

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:11.941
VERY PROUD AT. THIS IS NOT TO

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:12.942
BE A DICK HONEST COORDINATOR

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:14.543
BUT MORE SO FOR THE LACK OF

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.746
COMMUNICATION RESOURCES BENDER

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:19.248
PROCESS AND A LACK OF OVERSIGHT

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:21.250
AND A LACK OF FUNDING. I DON'T

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:23.185
HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS HOWEVER I

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:24.754
SAW THERE WAS A PROBLEM FOR MY

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.655
SON AND I WANTED TO DO

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.523
SOMETHING SO WE STARTED A

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.791
NONPROFIT AND I APPLIED TO

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:30.860
BECOME A BOARD MEMBER AND NORTH

BAY REGIONAL CENTER. DURING THE

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:33.829
REGIONAL CENTER MEETINGS I CAN

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:35.765
SEE THE VISION I CAN SEE THE

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:38.901
DIRECTION. I CAN SEE MOVED. THE

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:41.003
MOVEMENT ON A LARGE SCALE. BUT

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.104
IT DOES NOT TRANSLATE TO MY SON

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:45.975
AS A CLIENT. I KNOW THIS IS

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:49.111
BEING WORKED ON. AND WE HAVE AN

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.613
EXCEPTIONAL LEADER AT NORTE

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.882
REGIONAL CENTER. BUT IT'S BEEN

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:54.350
A REALLY LONG ROAD FOR STARRING

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.485
IN AND I AND I KNOW THAT THE

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:57.987

IEP MEETING OR IPP MEANING IT

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:18.360

LONGER HERE HE PASSED AWAY IN

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:54.163
TWENTY EIGHTEEN. HE WAS THE P.

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:58.734
TO ME OF JOY. HE WAS A BLESSING

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.436
TO ME AND TO EVERYONE HE

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:03.706
INTERACTED WITH. DAVID HAD MANY

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:06.375
DESIRES THINGS THAT HE WANTED

DIFFERENT ABILITIES. THAT COULD

01:09:19.722 --> 01:09:20.990
BE A CHALLENGE SOMETIMES

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:22.825
DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:24.193
SPECTRUM THAT THEY'RE ON WITH

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.096
AUTISM. ALTHOUGH MY SON WAS

DIFFICULTY IS LOOKING AT YOU.

EXPRESS SEEN WHAT HE NEEDED TO

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.373
SHARE BECAUSE HIS SPOTS WERE

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:40.342
RECAPTURED IN HIS IN HIS MIND

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:43.812
IN IT HE ARTICULATED THAT TO ME

MEMBER OF A REGIONAL CENTER-

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.638
PART AVERAGE JUST BECAUSE I

TO JUST GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:25.867
BACKGROUND. SO WHEN I WAS FIRST

01:23:25.934 --> 01:23:27.635

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:33.875
REACHES EARNERS CONCLUSION THAT

I HAD A SEVERE INTELLECTUAL

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.179
DISABILITY AND THEY THOUGHT I

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:40.315
WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.216

MISDIAGNOSIS LIKE THAT THEY'RE

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:59.067
JUST GOING TO CAUSE STRESS. SO

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:03.271
ANYWAY. I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:04.139
ABOUT WHAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:06.007
DO BUT ALSO WHERE THEY NEED TO

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:08.543
BE IMPROVED. AND WHEN I WAS

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:10.445
DOING COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND MY

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:12.313
UNDERGRADUATE WORK AT SAN

TRANSFERRED I DID WORK WITH THE

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:15.717
DEPARTMENT OF VOCATIONAL REHAB.

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:18.653
WHICH PROVIDED SOME SIMILAR

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.422
SERVICES LIKE JOB COACHING AND

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:22.223
PAYING FOR COLLEGE. THE FIRST

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.926
TIME AFTER I GRADUATED I HAD A

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:27.429
COUNSELOR THAT FOCUSED. ON ME

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:28.997
TRYING TO GET A JOB. BUT I WAS

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:31.399
ADAMANT ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:33.835
SO THAT ENDED UP. NOT WORKING

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.371

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.529
IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE. A YOUNG

01:41:08.595 --> 01:41:10.297
FAMILY WHO'S JUST BEEN-

01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:11.632
INFORMED THAT THEY HAVE A CHILD

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:13.667
WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:14.501
AND THE CHALLENGE OF NAVIGATING

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:16.370
WHETHER SCHOOL SYSTEM ACCESS

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:18.038
SEEN COORDINATED CARE THROUGH

01:41:18.105 --> 01:41:19.306
OTHER SYSTEMS AND THEN ALSO

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:20.874
NAVIGATING THE REGIONAL CENTER.

01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:22.276
THAT HAVING THAT LOWER CASE

01:41:22.342 --> 01:41:23.977
LOAD RATIO IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:25.179
SO WE HAVE THAT PROPOSED THIS

YEAR IN MOVING THAT FORWARD.

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:28.582
ALSO WITH THE SAFETY NET IS

01:41:28.649 --> 01:41:29.950
RECOGNIZING THAT FAMILIES HAVE

01:41:30.017 --> 01:41:31.952

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:48.715
RELATIVELY HIGH IMPLEMENTATION

01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:51.384
RATE THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED

OTHER RECOMMENDATION BUT I DID

01:55:12.138 --> 01:55:14.407
WANT TO TOUCH ON FIRST OF ALL

01:55:14.474 --> 01:55:15.241

RECOMMENDATIONS. REALLY A LOT

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:19.379
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE

01:55:19.445 --> 01:55:21.781
MADE FOCUS ON INCREASING

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:26.919
OVERSIGHT BY DD UPS AND ALSO

01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:27.453
ENSURING THAT THE REGIONAL

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.856
CENTER. CONSISTENT PROCESS IS

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:33.893
SURE THE THEY'RE FIGHTING CAN

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:36.863
ALREADY SIR THIS I IN ADDITION

01:55:36.929 --> 01:55:40.166
OUR RECORD. AS IT IS TO ANY TO

01:55:40.233 --> 01:55:40.867
IS REALLY TO IMPROVE ACTIVE

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:44.971
NISSEN EFFICIENT AND GOVERNOR

01:55:45.038 --> 01:55:47.874
IN THOSE STATION LAMP TED ALL

01:55:47.940 --> 01:56:00.586
OF. OFFER. ON THE STATUS OF THE

01:56:00.653 --> 01:56:02.355
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN WE

01:56:02.422 --> 01:56:03.856
FOLLOW UP AGAIN EVERY YEAR

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:06.059
THEREAFTER FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE

01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:08.227
YEARS- THE ENTITIES PROVIDE US

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:09.862
WITH SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:11.664
AND THEN WE ASSESS. THE STATUS

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:14.467
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS- IT'S

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:15.802
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:17.103
THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:18.805
REPORTS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:56:18.871 --> 01:56:20.206
HERE TODAY HAVE ALREADY RUN

01:56:20.273 --> 01:56:22.241
THROUGH THAT CYCLE. WE ONLY

01:56:22.308 --> 01:56:24.577
HAVE THE ONE REMAINING FROM TWO

01:56:24.644 --> 01:56:25.278
THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT WERE

01:56:25.345 --> 01:56:27.580
STILL FOLLOWING UP ON. NOW AS

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:29.782
IT RELATES TO THAT REPORT- WE

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:32.018
CONDUCTED A REPORT A REGARDING

01:56:32.085 --> 01:56:33.453
IN HOME RESPITE SERVICES AS I

01:56:33.519 --> 01:56:35.455
INDICATED IT WAS RELEASED IN

01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:37.457
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WE FOUND

01:56:37.523 --> 01:56:38.224
A COUPLE OF SIGNIFICANT

01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:41.494
CONCERNS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:42.628
ONE IT WAS NOT KENTUCKY

01:56:42.695 --> 01:56:44.797
CONDUCTING FISCAL AUDITS OF

01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:46.199
REGIONAL CENTERS THAT IT'S

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:48.201
REQUIRED TO DO EVERY TWO YEARS

01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:50.370
WITH IN A TIMELY MANNER WE

01:56:50.436 --> 01:56:53.106
RECOMMENDED THAT EFFECTS THAT.

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:54.941
I IN ADDITION. READ CENTERS

01:56:55.007 --> 01:56:57.143
MUST REVIEW VENDORS OR

01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:59.712
PROVIDERS FILES EVERY TWO YEARS

01:56:59.779 --> 01:57:01.681
THAT'S A FORM OF OVERSIGHT THAT

01:57:01.748 --> 01:57:02.682
THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE OVER

01:57:02.749 --> 01:57:04.617
VENDORS. AND WE FOUND THAT

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:05.952
THOSE REVIEWS BASED ON OUR

01:57:06.018 --> 01:57:07.487
REVIEW OF FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:09.922
WERE NOT OCCURRING- OR IF THEY

01:57:09.989 --> 01:57:10.957
WERE OCCURRING THEY COULDN'T

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:12.492
DEMONSTRATE TO US THAT THEY HAD

01:57:12.558 --> 01:57:14.394
ACTUALLY HAPPENED. SO WE

01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:15.862
RECOMMENDED TO DDS AT THE

01:57:15.928 --> 01:57:17.764
INSURER THAT DIGITAL CENTERS

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:19.932
HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO

01:57:19.999 --> 01:57:21.634
ENSURE THOSE REVIEWS OF HER.

01:57:21.701 --> 01:57:23.269
AYE DDS AGREED TO IMPLEMENT

01:57:23.336 --> 01:57:26.105
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONSBACK IN

01:57:26.172 --> 01:57:26.672
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THEY'RE

01:57:26.739 --> 01:57:28.474
STILL WORKING ON THAT AND THEY

01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:30.176
SAID. THAT THEY WILL IMPLEMENT

01:57:30.243 --> 01:57:32.311
THEM FULLY BY THE END OF THIS

01:57:32.378 --> 01:57:33.946
YEAR IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY.

01:57:34.013 --> 01:57:36.149
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU JUST A

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:37.950
COUPLE OF EXAMPLES TO OF

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:39.352
RECOMMENDATIONS THE DDS THAT

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:40.853
THEY WOULDN'T EMPLOYMENT. I

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.755
THINK THAT CAN BE INSIGHTFUL.

01:57:42.822 --> 01:57:44.791
IT'S IMPORTANT POINT OUT THOUGH

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:45.558
THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE

01:57:45.625 --> 01:57:47.894
MADE NEARLY TEN YEARS AGO- BUT

01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:48.995
WE STILL STAND BY THESE

01:57:49.061 --> 01:57:53.900
RECOMMENDATIONS. WHEN DR AUDIT

01:57:53.966 --> 01:57:57.770
TO TEN WHICH WAS A- RAW. BUT IT.

01:57:57.837 --> 01:58:01.407
UP WE DIE YES IS OVER I OF READ

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:04.844
SKINNER. ACTION I VENDORS OF

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:05.945
FOUND SOMETHING KINDS. OF FOR.

01:58:06.012 --> 01:58:06.512
WE FOR SOME INDICATION THERE

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:08.314
WAS FOR. BY REGIONAL CENTERS

01:58:08.381 --> 01:58:10.950
WHEN SELECTING VENDORS AND OF

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:11.918
COURSE THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS A

01:58:11.984 --> 01:58:13.653
SURE THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING HIGH

01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:16.222
SCHOOL THE SERVICES. ARE ANSWER.

01:58:16.289 --> 01:58:17.990
WELL FOUND THAT HE'D DIDN'T A

01:58:18.057 --> 01:58:19.759
PROPER TO OVER. HOW CENTERS

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:21.594
WERE SELECTING VENDORS SO WE

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:22.995
MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:26.899
THOSE TWO AREAS OF CONCERN BUT

01:58:26.966 --> 01:58:27.800
EDS STATED THAT IT DIDN'T

01:58:27.867 --> 01:58:29.702
BELIEVE IT HAD THE AUTHORITY TO

01:58:29.769 --> 01:58:30.069
IMPLEMENT THOSE

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:32.138
RECOMMENDATIONS. WHICH IS A

01:58:32.205 --> 01:58:33.539
POSITION THAT OUR OFFICE

01:58:33.606 --> 01:58:35.641
STRONGLY. DISAGREED WITH AND

01:58:35.708 --> 01:58:39.679
STILL DOES- TODAY UP AND I ALSO

01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:41.147
WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN

01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:42.915
THOSE TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS

01:58:42.982 --> 01:58:45.418
ARE MADE WE MISS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:47.587
TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. AND

01:58:47.653 --> 01:58:51.090
ACCOUNTABILITY. FINALLY WHEN I

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:51.657
WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE FACT

01:58:51.724 --> 01:58:55.161
THAT WE ALSO MAKE LEGISLATIVE

01:58:55.228 --> 01:58:56.863
RECOMMENDATIONS. I IN THE

01:58:56.929 --> 01:58:57.930
REPORTS OF DISCUSS HERE TO. WE

01:58:57.997 --> 01:58:58.865
MADE A TOTAL SEVEN. A ONE OF

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:00.099
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN

01:59:00.166 --> 01:59:02.468
ACTED ON BY THE LEGISLATURE- IN

01:59:02.535 --> 01:59:03.436
TYPICALLY WE MAKE THOSE

01:59:03.503 --> 01:59:04.537
RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN WE

01:59:04.604 --> 01:59:06.072
IDENTIFY A NEED FOR A POLICY

01:59:06.138 --> 01:59:08.641
CHANGE OR WE NEED TO COMPEL THE

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:10.877
DEPARTMENT. TO AT LEAST FOLLOW

01:59:10.943 --> 01:59:12.278
THROUGH WITH A RECOMMENDATION

01:59:12.345 --> 01:59:13.346
THAT WE BELIEVE WARRANTS

01:59:13.412 --> 01:59:15.281
LEGISLATIVE CHANGE SO AS AN

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:17.149
EXAMPLE IN THAT IN THAT TWO

01:59:17.216 --> 01:59:17.717
THOUSAND TEN REPORT I JUST

01:59:17.783 --> 01:59:19.552
DESCRIBED TO YOU WE CONDUCTED A

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:21.254
FOLLOW UP IN TWO THOUSAND

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.389
FIFTEEN. AND IN THAT REPORT WE

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:24.790
IDENTIFY THE SAME ISSUES THAT

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:27.159
WE HAD PREVIOUSLY NO OVERSIGHT

01:59:27.226 --> 01:59:28.027
OF REGIONAL CENTERS VENDOR

01:59:28.094 --> 01:59:30.162
SELECTION. AND BECAUSE WE KNEW

01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:31.731
THAT DDS WAS GOING TO MAINTAIN

01:59:31.797 --> 01:59:33.032
THE POSITION THAT THEY DIDN'T

01:59:33.099 --> 01:59:34.000
BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:35.201
TO DO THAT WE MADE OUR

01:59:35.268 --> 01:59:36.402
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

01:59:36.469 --> 01:59:38.237
LEGISLATURE. TO TRY TO COMPEL

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:40.139
THE DEPARTMENT TO ACTUALLY

01:59:40.206 --> 01:59:41.307
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:43.075
OVERSIGHT ULTIMATELY THOSE

01:59:43.142 --> 01:59:44.210
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STILL

01:59:44.277 --> 01:59:45.878
OUTSTANDING BUT AGAIN WE STAND

01:59:45.945 --> 01:59:47.847
BY THEM. THEY WOULD INCREASE

01:59:47.914 --> 01:59:48.214
TRANSPARENCY AND

01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:51.217
ACCOUNTABILITY. IN CLOSING I

01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:53.986
WANTED I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:59:54.053 --> 01:59:55.221
THE REPORTS I COVER TODAY.

01:59:55.288 --> 01:59:57.056
WE'RE SOMEWHAT NARROW IN SCOPE

01:59:57.123 --> 01:59:58.291
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TWO

01:59:58.357 --> 02:00:00.092
THOUSAND TEN AUDIT. THE TWO

02:00:00.159 --> 02:00:00.693
THOUSAND SIXTEEN AUDIT FOCUSED

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:02.895
ON A VERY SMALL PROGRAM- IN

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:04.730
TERMS OF DDS A SPENDING ONLY

02:00:04.797 --> 02:00:06.332
FIVE PERCENT. OF ITS DIRECT

02:00:06.399 --> 02:00:08.000
SERVICES BUDGET GOES TO IN HOME

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:09.602
RESPITE SERVICES AS A VERY

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:11.370
NARROW SCOPE. OF THE OTHER

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:13.005
REPORT THAT WE DID THAT I'VE

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:14.907
TOUCHED ON TODAY TEN YEARS AGO.

02:00:14.974 --> 02:00:16.909
OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY DECIDE

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:17.910
THAT NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:19.946
CONDUCT ANOTHER STATE AUDIT. WE

02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:21.981
HAVE NEW LEADERSHIP A DDS AS

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:23.382
EVIDENCED BY THE DIRECTOR WHO

02:00:23.449 --> 02:00:25.818
JUST SPOKE HERE BEFORE ME-

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:26.652
THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT TONE

02:00:26.719 --> 02:00:28.688
FROM THE TOP. A IT WOULD BE

02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:31.958
VALUE ADDED TO POSSIBLY TRY TO

02:00:32.024 --> 02:00:33.993
IDENTIFY. HOW DIFFICULT IT

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:35.561
COULD BE FOR A CONSUMER TO

02:00:35.628 --> 02:00:38.030
NAVIGATE- THE REGIONAL CENTERS

02:00:38.097 --> 02:00:39.699
AND TRIED TO OBTAIN SERVICES

02:00:39.765 --> 02:00:42.268
FROM THEM. IT ALSO MIGHT BE.

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:44.003
BENEFICIAL TO DETERMINE WHAT

02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:45.204
TYPE OF OVERSIGHT REGIONAL

02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:46.005
CENTERS ARE PROVIDING OF

02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:48.007
VENDORS. AND THE SAME WITH EDS

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:49.275
AS OVERSIGHT OF REGIONAL

02:00:49.342 --> 02:00:50.910
CENTERS ALL WITH THE GOAL OF

02:00:50.977 --> 02:00:51.777
COURSE OF INCREASING THE

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:53.546
QUALITY OF SERVICES. THE

02:00:53.613 --> 02:00:56.048
CONSUMERS ARE RECEIVING. OF THE

02:00:56.115 --> 02:00:57.383
STATE AUDITOR OF COURSE TO BE

02:00:57.450 --> 02:00:59.418
HAPPY TO CONDUCT ANY AUDIT THAT

02:00:59.485 --> 02:01:01.287
THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTS. AND

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:03.289
ANOTHER OF A VERY POSITIVE

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:04.790
ASPECT OF AN AUDIT OF COURSE IS

02:01:04.857 --> 02:01:06.492
THAT WE ARE INDEPENDENT WE ARE

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:08.561
NONPARTISAN. AND WE CONDUCT OUR

02:01:08.628 --> 02:01:09.929
REVIEWS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

02:01:09.996 --> 02:01:12.031
RIGOROUS STANDARDS. SO I JUST

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:14.100
WANTED TO POINT OUT THOSE FACTS

02:01:14.166 --> 02:01:16.035
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

CONCLUDE MY TESTIMONY. ANY

02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:23.142

REGIONAL CENTERS. CAN YOU

02:04:15.881 --> 02:04:18.317
DEFINE OR DESCRIBE WHAT A

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:20.686
REVIEW IS YES THE KEY IS AS

02:04:20.753 --> 02:04:23.222
SIMPLE AS- LOOKING THROUGH THE

02:04:23.289 --> 02:04:26.492
FILE OR IS THIS AN EXTENSIVE-

02:04:26.559 --> 02:04:29.128
LEVEL KIND OF A REVIEW THAT IT

02:04:29.195 --> 02:04:30.729
INVOLVES THAT. YOU KNOW

02:04:30.796 --> 02:04:32.064
INTERACTION WITH WITH THE

02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:34.667
PRIMARY AND OTHER ADVOCATES CAN

02:04:34.733 --> 02:04:37.069
YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS YES

02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:40.039
THIS REVIEW IS JUST AS YOU HAD

02:04:40.105 --> 02:04:41.874
DESCRIBED IT IS VERY LIMITED.

02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:44.777
IT IS SIMPLY TO REVIEWING THE

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:46.512
VENDOR FILE THAT THE REGIONAL

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:48.214
CENTER MAINTAINS TO MAKE SURE

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:50.382
THAT THEIR LICENSING THE

02:04:50.449 --> 02:04:53.519
CERTIFICATIONS ARE UP TO DATE

02:04:53.586 --> 02:04:54.920
THAT THEY HAVE A CURRENT

02:04:54.987 --> 02:04:57.122
SERVICE DELIVERY DESIGN. OF

02:04:57.189 --> 02:05:00.226
IT'S REALLY LIMITED TO US THAT

02:05:00.292 --> 02:05:02.595
AND IT'S NOT TIME CONSUMING

02:05:02.661 --> 02:05:04.496
WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE WENT OUT

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:06.031
TO THE FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS IS

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:08.500
THAT'S A COUPLE WEREN'T EVEN

02:05:08.567 --> 02:05:09.301
AWARE THAT IT OF THE

02:05:09.368 --> 02:05:10.803
REQUIREMENT. AND THAT THEY NEED

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:12.304
TO BE DOING IT SO THAT COULD

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:13.839
HAVE BEEN PART OF THE REASON

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:15.975
THAT IT WASN'T BEING PERFORMED.

02:05:16.041 --> 02:05:17.009
OF THE OTHER THREE SIMPLY JUST

02:05:17.076 --> 02:05:18.544
DIDN'T HAVE A PROCESS FOR

02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:20.312
DOCUMENTING THE REVIEWS BUT

02:05:20.379 --> 02:05:22.181
THEY ARE CRITICAL BECAUSE WHEN

02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:23.949
WE WENT THROUGH THOSE FILES WE

02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:24.717
FOUND THAT SOME DIDN'T HAVE

02:05:24.783 --> 02:05:26.752
UPDATED INFORMATION. AND THE

02:05:26.819 --> 02:05:28.220
RISK OF COURSE IS THAT YOU HAVE

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:29.989
VENDORS PROVIDING SERVICES TO

02:05:30.055 --> 02:05:31.891
CONSUMERS. WHO ARE NOT

02:05:31.957 --> 02:05:34.193
QUALIFIED AND MEET FEDERAL

02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:37.496
REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU AND

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:38.564
I'LL GO BACK TO WHAT I'VE SAID

02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:39.765
IN OTHER HEARINGS WHEN IS WHEN

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:41.800
WE HAD TO THE STATE AUDITOR.

02:05:41.867 --> 02:05:43.135
THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA REALLY

02:05:43.202 --> 02:05:44.169
NEED TO THINK THE STATE AUDITOR

02:05:44.236 --> 02:05:46.472
FOR BEING THAT ADVOCATE FOR

02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:48.707
THEM IN A YOU KNOW A NON BIASED

02:05:48.774 --> 02:05:51.243
A- ARENA. ONE OF THE THINGS

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:53.312
THAT- I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:54.880
TODAY'S WHEN YOU SEE THIS IS

02:05:54.947 --> 02:05:56.916
GLARINGLY ABSENT IS WE HAVE NO

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:59.051
PROVIDERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY. ON

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:02.688
A PANEL. AND THEY DIDN'T WANT

02:06:02.755 --> 02:06:03.255
TO SHOW UP TODAY FOR FEAR OF

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:06.025
REPRISAL. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:08.027
AFRAID OF VOICING OF HOW THEY

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:10.296
FEEL THEY'VE BEEN TREATED OR OR

02:06:10.362 --> 02:06:12.531
ANY OF THAT KIND OF MANNER AND

02:06:12.598 --> 02:06:13.165
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS SHOULD

02:06:13.232 --> 02:06:14.900
SHARE THAT. THEY'RE NOT HERE

02:06:14.967 --> 02:06:17.036
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE

02:06:17.102 --> 02:06:19.872
AFRAID OF BEING A PUNISHED IN

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:24.009
DIFFERENT LOCALES AND- AND THAT

02:06:24.076 --> 02:06:26.445
THAT'S BEEN. KIND OF A COP

02:06:26.512 --> 02:06:27.947
GLARING THING THAT'S WE'VE

02:06:28.013 --> 02:06:28.614
NOTICES THE HEARINGS THROUGHOUT

SAY IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE I'M

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:34.219
JUST SAYING THAT THIS IS WHAT

02:06:34.286 --> 02:06:35.154
HAS BEEN KIND OF THE NORM FOR

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:36.922
US. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

02:06:36.989 --> 02:06:38.290
THINK THAT I'D LIKE TO

02:06:38.357 --> 02:06:39.625
ACKNOWLEDGE IS THOUGH AND I.

02:06:39.692 --> 02:06:40.759
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:06:40.826 --> 02:06:42.294
PERSPECTIVE OF GOING INTO THE

FISCAL ANNA AND THE OVERSIGHT

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:45.130
OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS. BUT

02:06:45.197 --> 02:06:46.498
I'VE HAD THE THOUGHT OF MAYBE

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:48.500
THE STATE AUDITOR WOULD B ABLE

02:06:48.567 --> 02:06:49.735

02:06:56.408 --> 02:06:57.977
DEFICIENCIES FROM THAT GOING

02:06:58.043 --> 02:07:00.012
FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT WOULD

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:04.350
BE. KIND OF VALIDATION OR- AN

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:07.019

02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:07.671
ENTERED FLUCTUATING LEVELS OF

02:44:07.737 --> 02:44:09.973
SUPPORT FROM THE STATE OVER THE

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:11.975
PAST DECADE. PAST SEVERAL

02:44:12.042 --> 02:44:15.111
DECADES. YET THE NUMBER OF

02:44:15.178 --> 02:44:17.414
INDIVIDUALS WHITE EIGHTY D.

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:19.583
CONTINUES TO RISE. OVER THE

02:44:19.649 --> 02:44:21.952
LAST DECADE WE HAVE SEEN OVER A

02:44:22.018 --> 02:44:23.787
HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW CONSUMERS.

02:44:23.853 --> 02:44:27.757
ENTER THE SYSTEM. MORE THAN

02:44:27.824 --> 02:44:28.325
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

02:44:28.391 --> 02:44:29.726
CALIFORNIANS ARE NOW THESE ARE

02:44:29.793 --> 02:44:33.863
CALIFORNIANS. NOW BEING

02:44:33.930 --> 02:44:34.464
SERVICED AND WE SHOULD EXPECT

02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:37.467
TO SEE MORE. WE HAVE WE HAVE

02:44:37.534 --> 02:44:38.935
SEEN A FEW GAINS IN OUR STATE

02:44:39.002 --> 02:44:41.004
BUDGETS TO MEET THESE NEEDS AND

02:44:41.071 --> 02:44:41.571
THEY'VE BEEN INCREMENTAL THE

02:44:41.638 --> 02:44:44.774
BEST. PARTICULAR THE BUDGET WE

02:44:44.841 --> 02:44:45.809
PASSED LAST YEAR DOES INCLUDE A

02:44:45.875 --> 02:44:47.444
RATE INCREASE FOR SUS SERVICE

02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:49.679
PROVIDERS. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

02:44:49.746 --> 02:44:51.014
OF DOLLARS ARE GOING INTO THE

02:44:51.081 --> 02:44:54.117
SYSTEM. THERE ARE CURRENT

02:44:54.184 --> 02:44:55.385
PROPOSALS O EXTEND SOME OF

02:44:55.452 --> 02:44:57.087
THESE INCREASES AND INTRODUCE

02:44:57.153 --> 02:45:00.290
FISCAL ROOF REFORMS. BUT THE

02:45:00.357 --> 02:45:02.025
STATE STILL HAS NOT DONE NEARLY

02:45:02.092 --> 02:45:05.528
ENOUGH. THE ADD COMMUNITIES

02:45:05.595 --> 02:45:07.764
BEING LEFT BEHIND WHILE OTHER

02:45:07.831 --> 02:45:09.766
AREAS OF SOCIAL SAFETY NETS ARE

02:45:09.833 --> 02:45:11.434
BEING FULLY FUNDED. IT'S NOT

02:45:11.501 --> 02:45:15.105
FAIR. THE INCREASE FUNDING FOR

02:45:15.171 --> 02:45:17.274
IT PROGRAMS THE BUDGET PROVIDED

02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:19.142
HAS ONLY BEEN IN EFFECT FOR

02:45:19.209 --> 02:45:21.444
TWENTY EIGHT DAYS. AND THE FACT

02:45:21.511 --> 02:45:23.079
THAT IS SOME PROGRAMS WERE NOT

02:45:23.146 --> 02:45:25.949
ABLE TO WAIT. FOR THAT- THE

02:45:26.016 --> 02:45:27.784
TIME THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. I'VE

02:45:27.851 --> 02:45:30.153
HEARD OF CLOSURES IN MY AREA

02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:30.720
AND I'M SURE OTHERS ARE ALSO

02:45:30.787 --> 02:45:35.225
AFFECTED. THAT'S JUST WRONG. I

02:45:35.292 --> 02:45:36.159
HAVE TO GO BACK TO A MOTHER

02:45:36.226 --> 02:45:41.097
THAT I- WORKED ON HER CASE. AND

02:45:41.164 --> 02:45:42.532
SHE SAID IT WAS EASIER FOR HER

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:43.800
TO GO ON WELFARE THAN TRYING TO

02:45:43.867 --> 02:45:47.037
FIND ADVOCATE SO THAT SHE COULD

02:45:47.103 --> 02:45:50.040
FIGHT FULL TIME FOR HER SON.

02:45:50.106 --> 02:45:50.640
SHE WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP HER

02:45:50.707 --> 02:45:54.644
CAREER. TO PROVIDE A OF FUTURE

02:45:54.711 --> 02:45:58.848
LIFE FOR HER SON. THAT'S WRONG.

02:45:58.915 --> 02:46:00.216
WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

02:46:00.283 --> 02:46:01.851
THAT THE MORTALITY RATE ON

02:46:01.918 --> 02:46:06.056
MARRIAGE IS ABOUT 85% WHEN YOU

02:46:06.122 --> 02:46:08.625
HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS FAMILY. WE

02:46:08.692 --> 02:46:10.393
NEED TO DO BETTER TO SUPPORT

02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:13.363
THAT FAMILY UNIT. WHERE

02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:15.231
PROGRAMS ARE STILL STRUGGLING

02:46:15.298 --> 02:46:17.734
BECAUSE OUR STATE. LEGISLATURE

02:46:17.801 --> 02:46:19.803
AND GOVERNOR'S AND NOW OUR

02:46:19.869 --> 02:46:21.137
CURRENT LEGISLATURE AND

02:46:21.204 --> 02:46:22.572
GOVERNOR HAVE ONLY GIVEN THE

02:46:22.639 --> 02:46:24.541
SYSTEM TO INCREASES. IN THE

02:46:24.607 --> 02:46:28.244
PAST TWENTY YEARS. DESPITE THE

02:46:28.311 --> 02:46:30.447
COMPLETION OF THE RATE STUDY.

02:46:30.513 --> 02:46:32.482
WHICH CONFIRMS A CURRENT BUDGET

02:46:32.549 --> 02:46:34.684
FOR OF SHORTFALL OF AT LEAST

02:46:34.751 --> 02:46:36.786
ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS.

02:46:36.853 --> 02:46:39.356
WISHES THAT'S DEBATABLE COULD

02:46:39.422 --> 02:46:40.557
BE AND SHOULD BE PROBABLY MORE

02:46:40.623 --> 02:46:43.059
THERE'S STILL NO STRATEGIC PLAN

02:46:43.126 --> 02:46:46.663
TO PHASE IN ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS.

02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:48.698
FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS THE IDT

02:46:48.765 --> 02:46:49.265
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ASKED TO

02:46:49.332 --> 02:46:55.205
WAIT. FOR AN AUDIT TO FINISH

02:46:55.271 --> 02:46:55.672
I'M FOR RACE DAY TO BE

02:46:55.739 --> 02:46:58.641
COMPLETED. AND FOR SOME FUNDING

02:46:58.708 --> 02:47:01.311
TO TAKE IN FACT. I'M HERE TO

02:47:01.378 --> 02:47:03.079
SAY. THERE'S NO MORE REASON TO

02:47:03.146 --> 02:47:06.716
WAIT. IT'S TIME TO. MAKE

02:47:06.783 --> 02:47:10.320
PROGRESS WE NEED TO MAKE A PLAN

02:47:10.387 --> 02:47:12.589
AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT NOW.

02:47:12.655 --> 02:47:14.391
UNTIL WE HAVE A PLAN WE CAN

02:47:14.457 --> 02:47:15.892
SIMPLY WE CAN'T SIMPLY ABANDON

02:47:15.959 --> 02:47:17.527
THESE PROGRAMS A WRIST SOME

02:47:17.594 --> 02:47:19.195
FALLING APART BECAUSE WE THINK.

02:47:19.262 --> 02:47:20.463
THERE MIGHT BE CHANGES IN THE

02:47:20.530 --> 02:47:24.868
SYSTEM THREE YEARS FROM NOW.

02:47:24.934 --> 02:47:25.869
THE DEPARTMENT OF ALMOST

02:47:25.935 --> 02:47:27.137

02:47:27.203 --> 02:47:29.038

02:47:29.105 --> 02:47:32.041
FLAWS. AND WE ALL SEE THE

02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:34.177
POTENTIAL OF A PATH FOR A VERY

02:47:34.244 --> 02:47:38.014
