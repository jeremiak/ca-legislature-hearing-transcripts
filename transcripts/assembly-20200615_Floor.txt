FIFTY TWO IS AB. NINETEEN FIFTY. THE CLERK WILL READ ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEENTH BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KAMLAGER AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE A PROBATION. MS KAMLAGER YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU COULD HAVE MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN FIFTY THIS BILL IS ONE OF THE BLACK CAUCUSES PRIORITY BILLS IT WOULD SET A MAXIMUM PROBATION PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FOR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES IN TWO YEARS FOR SOME FELONY OFFENSES. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT MANY OF THE LETTERS OF OPPOSITION STATING THAT THIS BILL. HAS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH WERE. DATED PRE AMENDMENT CROSSING AND THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED THE BILL EXAMS CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST MONETARY PROPERTY VALUED AT OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND ANY SPECIFIC CRIMES WITH PROBATION TERM LINKS IDENTIFIED BY STATUTE WHICH INCLUDE DO YOU EYES. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SUCH AND STRIKE FELONY OFFENSES MANY SEX CRIMES ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR PROBATION BY STATUTE UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION ONE TWO OH THREE POINT SIX FIVE AND ARE THEREFORE ALSO EXEMPT FROM AB NINETEEN FIFTY. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. IS A STATE'S ALL. GEN A JUDGE CAN REVOKE EXTEND TERMS OR RESTART THE CLOCK ALL AMOUNTING TO LENGTHY AND COSTLY PROBATIONARY TERMS. AB NINETEEN FIFTY CREATES REASONABLE AN EVIDENCE BASED LIMITS ON PROBATION TERMS AND IT OFFERS A SLIDING SCALE APPROACH SUPPORTING SUCCESS OVER PUNISHMENT AND LOWERING COSTS TO TAXPAYERS. IT RETAINS JUDICIAL X. DISCRETION AND RECOGNIZES THAT PROBATION CAN STILL BE REVOKED FOR SUBSTANTIVE VIOLATIONS. WHY IS AB NINETY BE NEEDED BECAUSE THE STATUS QUO HAS TO CHANGE PROBATION IS RACIAL CULTURAL REGIONAL CLASS BASED AN ARBITRARY. IT CRIPPLES SUB CULTURES AND ECONOMIC THE KANA MEANS ACROSS COUNTIES IT DEBILITATE FAMILIES. A CHILD HAS TO WATCH HIS OR HER MOTHER INDOOR THE FRUSTRATION OF FIGURING OUT WHERE TO LIVE AND WHERE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT ALL WITH ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS THAT MAKE THESE TASKS MORE DIFFICULT THAN THEY ARE. PROBATION IS AN INTER GENERATIONAL CURSE AND IT IS AS ARBITRARY AS THE CULTURE OF THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT AND THE OFFICERS WHO WORK WITH ANY. IT IS AS FAR FROM THE VISION OF JOHN AUGUSTA'S AS YOU COULD GET WHO WAS JOHN AUGUSTA'S HE WAS THE FATHER OF PROBATION. HE WAS A COP COBBLER FROM BOSTON WHO WOULD SIT IN THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM. AND HE WOULD ASK THE COURTS TO LEAVE THE DEFENDANTS IN HIS CARE WHERE HE WOULD RECLAIM THEM HE WOULD GUIDE THEM WITH STRUCTURE WITH TREATMENT AND COMPASSION WORKING THEM TOWARD SUCCESS NOT EXTENDED TERMS. WHY IS AB FIFTY NEEDED NINETEEN FIFTY NEEDED BECAUSE PROBATION IS THE MOST WIDELY USED FORM OF CORRECTIONAL CONTROL IN THIS STATE. OUR ADULT SUPERVISED PROBATION POPULATION IS ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE NATION MORE THAN TWICE THE SIZE OF THE TATE'S PRISON POPULATION ALMOST FOUR TIMES LARGER THAN ITS JAIL POPULATION. AND ABOUT SIX TIMES LARGER THAN OUR PAROLE POPULATION AND A CLOG THE COURTS MORE THAN ANY OTHER FORM OF SUPERVISION. A PROBATION TERM MAY REQUIRE THAT YOU CONTINUOUSLY SEEKING MAINTAIN GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT YOUR ABILITY TO TRAVEL ACROSS COUNTY LINES MAY BE RESTRICTED YOU MAY BE SUBMITTED TO A SEARCH OF YOUR PERSON OR YOUR HOME WITHOUT WARNING. YOU MAY BE IN VIOLATION OF YOUR TERMS IF YOU ARE LATE OR MISSED AN APPOINTMENT INTERACT WITH FRIENDS FAMILY MEMBERS RIDE IN THE FRONT SEAT OF A CAR OR EVEN GET PREGNANT. I HAVE SOME REAL STORIES FOR YOU. CHRISTOPHER LAW LOS. WAS IN VIOLATION OF HIS TERM BECAUSE HE WENT TO VISIT HIS MOTHER AT HER HOUSE WHERE HIS ON PROBATION COUSIN LIVED. ULYSSES RODRIGUEZ WAS IN VIOLATION OF HIS PROBATION BECAUSE HE COULD NOT COMPLETE HIS FINAL TWELVE HOURS OF BEACH CLEAN UP FOR HIS COMMUNITY SERVICE DURING THE COLD A PANDEMIC WHEN THE BEACHES WERE CLOSED. CRUZ MEMBRANE AN ARMY VETERAN WAS IN VIOLATION OF HIS PROBATION BECAUSE HE COULD NOT KEEP HIS PROBATION OFFICER APPRISED OF HIS PERMANENT ADDRESS WHEN HE WAS CAST FROM TEMPORARY HOUSING AND ENDED UP HOMELESS LIVING ON THE STREETS THIRTY SECONDS RODRICK SCUDDER WAS VIA. FOR MOVING FOUR MILES FROM CONTENT TO LANGUAGE BECAUSE HE SIGNED THE LEASE WITH OUT ASKING HIS PROBATION OFFICER'S PERMISSION WITHOUT HER GOING TO SEE THE APARTMENT AND APPROVED THE APARTMENT CRYSTAL RIOS WAS ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO BECOME AN LV IN AND HAD TO MAKE A DECISION BETWEEN GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND GOING TO HER PROBATION OFFICER APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE WOULD NOT. CHANGE THE APPOINTMENT TIMES. BEING ON PROBATION WITH THESE EXTENDED TERMS IS LIKE LIVING IN QUICKSAND. AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS MICROMANAGE PEOPLE IN APPLY HAPHAZARD RULES DESIGNED TO CATCH FOLKS THIS BILL. THE ONE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON WITH OUR PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE KEEP THEIR FUNDING SUPPORTED THROUGH THE SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT PERFORMANCE BASED FORMULA. BECAUSE IF YOU CAN LESSEN CASELOADS AND FOCUS ON INTENSIVE TREATMENT AND GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT YOU CAN CYCLE FOLKS OFF OF PROBATION SUCCESSFULLY PEOPLE SAY TWO YEARS IS NOT A LONG TIME YOU CAN BECOME AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER IN TWO YEARS. IF YOU HAVE MEASURABLE. PROGRAMMING ROBUST RESPONSIVE. AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE RESOURCE AND INVESTED IN WORKING TOWARD SUCCESS YOU CAN LOWER COSTS TO TAXPAYERS HAVE A SUCCESSFUL DEPARTMENT OF PROBATION. AND GIVE PACKED FOLKS WHAT THEY WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD SUCCESSFUL LIVES WITHOUT BEING TETHERED TO THE SYSTEM FOR EVER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. NINETEEN FIFTY MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. RESPECT WITH THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL. BUT I MUST SAY THAT HAVING BEEN A CRIMINAL TRIAL LAWYER BOTH AS A PROSECUTOR AS WELL AS AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER. THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE AUTHOR GAVE ON THE REALITIES A PROBATION ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH MY EXPERIENCE IN THE CRIMINAL COURTS. ME NUMBER ONE OPERATION IS OFTEN USED AS PART OF THE DISK THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION. IT OFTEN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO JAIL TIME. YEAH A LOT OF THAT IS NEGOTIATED EMPLOYEE BARGAINING I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY CASES WHERE BOTH THE PROSECUTION THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY WOULD AGREE THAT OKAY AND LIEU OF JAIL TIME OR IN LIEU OF ANY ADDITIONAL JAIL TIME WILL EXTEND THE PROBATION PERIOD SO I THINK THIS BILL WILL TAKE AWAY THAT TIME OF TWO TO SUPPRESSION. I PRE THE AUTHOR MAKING THEIR MEMBERS SO MY FOR QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR WAS THE IMPACT ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND ON DO YOU AYE CASES- AS THE AUTHOR INDICATED THOSE HAVE MINIMUM PROBATION PERIOD SPECIFIED. AND I BELIEVE HER AMENDMENTS- ADDRESS MY CONCERN IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT DEFENDANTS HAVE. ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF PROBATION. BUT THERE RE MANY OTHER CASES MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THIS. CAP ON PROBATION PERIOD WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE GOALS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN TERMS OF REHABILITATION. THERE ARE CASES THAT INVOLVE. DRUG REHAB PROGRAMS ALCOHOL ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS PROGRAMS STAY AWAY ORDERS FOR- VICTIMS OF CRIMES THAT ARE TIED TO THE PERIODS OF PROBATION THIS BILL WOULD INTERFERE WITH THOSE ATTEMPTS FOR COURTS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ORDER YOU KNOW DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. AND IT WOULD ALSO TAKE AWAY V. THE INCENTIVE OR OR THE ABILITY OF THE COURTS TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE DRUGS OR ANGER MANAGEMENT OR STAY AWAY ORDERS. FINALLY THERE THERE IS. RESTITUTION IS OFTEN TIED TO PROBATION WHERE FOR VICTIMS TO BE COMPENSATED FOR BEING VICTIMS OF CRIMES THAT OFTEN PROBATION IS USED TO ENSURE THAT THE CRIMINAL DEFENDANT PACE THE RESTITUTION THAT THEY OWE TO THE UP TO THE CRIME VICTIMS LAST BUT NOT LEAST. FROM MY EXPERIENCE. ALMOST ALL PROBATION VIOLATION- CASES. ARE BECAUSE SOMEONE PICKS UP A NEW CRIME. AND SO THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW THIS THIS- TAKES AWAY FROM THE ABILITY OF. PROSECUTORS TO YOU KNOW IN LIEU OF A FILING AND PURSUING NEW CHARGES THEY PURSUE A PROBATION VIOLATION SO THEY DO SO THAT THEY WOULD GET. SOME KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE NEW CRIME THAT WAS A THAT OCCURRED DURING- APPEARED WHEN SOMEONE IS ON PROBATION. SO YOU KNOW AGAIN I RESPECT- WHAT THE AUTHOR IS IT IS TRYING TO DO HERE BUT I THINK. IT IT DOESN'T PAYING A REALITY- PICTURE OF REALITY IN TERMS OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN OUR CRIMINAL COURT SYSTEMS AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE OPPOSE IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU MURATSUCHI MISTER KALRA YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. MISTER KALRA. PAUSE MISTER KALRA FEET MAY HAVE A TECHNICAL ISSUE. YEAH. A ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER JUST FOR OUR UNIVERSITY IS VERY BRIEFLY I KNOW WE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OF PRIOR- BUT TO OUR POLITICAL WORLD I WORKED AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR ELEVEN YEARS AND I CAN TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT PROBATION VIOLATIONS ARE NOT- PUT IN PLACE IN LIEU OF NEW CHARGES NEW CHARGES ARE BROUGHT AND THEY ADD PROBATION VIOLATIONS AS ADDITIONAL PENALTIES AND I CAN ALSO STATE THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S ARE MORE LIKE FOR PROBATION VIOLATIONS NOT A. B. NOT EVEN BE IN RELATION. TO A NEW CRIME BUT TO THE AUTHOR'S POINT THEY COULD BE SOME. IT'S AN APPOINTMENT THEY CAN BE NOT COMPLETING. IT COULD BE A LOT OF WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS. THAT IN MANY CASES WERE NOT IN THE CONTROL OF- OF THE PROBATIONER AND YET IT'S ONE STRIKE AND YOU'RE OUT. AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR FOR THE RICH FOR THE RECORD FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THAT FAR MORE PROBATION VIOLATIONS ARE DUE TO TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CONDITIONS OF PAROLE NOT NEW CHARGES AND AT THE NEW CRIME IS COMMITTED PROBATIONERS ARE CHARGED WITH THAT NEW CRIME. AND A PROBATION VIOLATION IS THAT IN ADDITION ADDED TO THAT AND SO I JUST WANTED. TO STATE THAT THOSE FACTS AND THAT I. UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORT AB NINETEEN FIFTY I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT PATH FOR OUR STATE. IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT PROBATION NEEDS THE MISSION OF. OF WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO WHICH IS TO TRULY REHABILITATE AND GET- PROBATIONERS BACK IN TO THE NORMAL MAINSTREAM OF LIFE- AND- TO BE AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL. NOT RESET OF EIGHT AND NOT MANY MORE CRIMES THANK YOU SPEAKER. THANK YOU MUCH KALRA DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YES MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN FIFTY THE COULDN'T A CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES IN OUR COMMUNITY IS THE OVER THE- A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ON PROBATION. AND THE FACT THAT IS IT IN ADDITION TO THAT IT BECOMES A ALMOST EIGHT AND pEXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE GREATEST FEAR IS THAT THE GUNNERS COMMITS A MINOR OFFENSE AND GO SOME PLACES SHOULD'VE GONE OR HAVE A- PERSON IN THEIR PRESENCE WHO THEY DIDN'T KNOW WAS GOING TO BE THERE AND AS A RESULT. THEY PICKED UP FOR VIOLATION OF THE PAROLE- IF THEY COMMIT NEW CRIMES ARE GOING TO BE SERVE THOSE ISSUES WITH THOSE AND CRIMES AND BE CONVICTED FOR IT. BUT BUT THE PROBATION PERIOD IS OFTEN SEEN THIS AS A- I GOT TO KIND OF X. A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE LONGER YOU ON PROBATION. THE MORE LIKELY YOU WANT VIOLATE SOMETHING THAT PROBATION THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO AT ALL WITH THE OFFENSE COPE BUT IT SO THE- LET'S GET A BLACK CAR. THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIORITY BE WE READ. THE AS IN TO TALK SOCIAL JUSTICE THE OPEN SURVEY. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE CAN. OF INDIVIDUALS. ALL BEING HARASSED MINGLE BUT IN ON A REGULAR BOXES OF AN OFFENSE AS HAVE THEIR PRINT TO REBEL THE AND THE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MS KAMLAGER YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR SPEAKING ON THIS BILL AND ALSO TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR TORRANCE- FOR RAISING SOME ISSUES THAT I CAN ADDRESS AND MY CLOTHES YOU KNOW PROBATION TO PLAY DO WE DO NOT DEBTORS PRISON- AND SO TO XIN CANNOT BE LINKED WITH PUNISHMENT. ONCE YOU ARE OFFER PROBATION YOU CAN STILL HAVE YOUR- RESTITUTION TRANSFER TO A CIVIL JUDGMENT WHERE IT STAYS WITH YOU FOR TEN YEARS AND YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY THAT BACK. THIS DOES NOT IMPACT NEW CRIMES IF YOU COMMIT A NEW CRIME AND YOU ARE CHARGED WITH THE NEW CRIME THE CLOCK STOPS AND YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE NEW CRIME. MY COLLEAGUE FROM TORRANCE IS CORRECT PROBATION AND PROSECUTORS OFTEN DO USE PROBATION AND THE TERMS OF BLACK PROBATION AS AN END RUN AROUND NEW CHARGES WHERE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE THE FAX AND CANNOT ACTUALLY CHARGED. A DEFENDANT WITH THE NEW CRIME BUT THAT IS ALSO NOT JUST. AND WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY WE ARE USING THAT SYSTEM TO CONTINUE TO TETHER FOLKS TO PROBATION WITH THE FEAR OF PUTTING THEM IN PRISON OR JAIL. I WANT TO ALSO ADD THAT WE SPEND AS A STATE TWO BILLION DOLLARS INCARCERATING FOLKS FOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS AS WE STRUGGLE WITH OUR BUDGET. ITEM I MUST. ASK THAT WE AGREED THAT WE CAN SPEND THOSE TWO BILLION DOLLARS SOME PLACE ELSE WHERE WE WILL SEE A GREATER TURN ON INVESTMENT. THIS DOES NOT IMPACT JUDICIAL DISCRETION IF YOU ARE GROSSLY OUT OF COMPLIANCE EVEN WITH THE CURRENT LAW THE JUDGE CAN REVOKE YOUR PROBATION. ULTIMATELY I WANT TO SAY WHY THIS IS A BLACK CAUCUS PRIORITY. BECAUSE THE DATA JUST LIKE THE DATA SHOWS THAT YOU CAN HAVE AFFECTED TERMS OF PROBATION THE SHORTER THE TERMS ARE THE MORE FOCUSED THEY ARE ON TREATMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THE DATA ALSO SHOWS THAT BLACK AMERICANS ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AT EVERY STAGE OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WE ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE PULLED OVER BY POLICE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE KILLED BY POLICE ARRESTED TWO AND A HALF TIMES MORE OFTEN. BAIL AND GIVEN 35% HIGHER BAIL AMOUNTS WHEN IT IS GRANTED WE ARE GIVEN 25% LONGER SENTENCE FOR THE SAME CRIME. WE ARE THE MAJORITY OF THOSE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES WE ARE SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE INCARCERATED MAKE UP 40% OF THOSE BEHIND BARS AND ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE ON PROBATION AND PAROLE AND WE REMAIN ON PROBATION PAROLE. LONGER AND YOUR LESS LIGHT TO FIND JOBS UPON ENTRY. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE NO MORE PREDISPOSED TO CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THAN ANY OTHER RACE. WE HAVE A REAL BLIND SPOTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON FEAR AND CLASS AND RACE. AND WE NEED TO OWN THE FACT THAT WE LIKE TO PUNISH BUT PUNISHMENT IS NOT WHAT JOHN AUGUSTA'S HAD IN MIND. WHEN HE THOUGHT A PROBATION. WE OFTEN PUNISHED WHAT WE FEAR BUT TODAY I THINK THE STREETS ARE TELLING US THAT FEAR IS NO LONGER A VIABLE PLAYBOOK. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB NINETEEN FIFTY. THANK YOU MS KAMLAGER.

THEY SUFFER FROM THE SIMILAR EMERGENCY THIS BILL WOULD PRECLUDE A SIMILAR EXECUTIVE ORDER BECAUSE IT IS GIVING IT IS APPROPRIATELY THE LEGISLATURE NOW TAKING THAT STEP AND GIVING THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE AUTHORITY WHETHER IT'S ON A REGIONAL BASIS OR A STATEWIDE BIT THIS. BASED ON AN EMERGENCY IN ORDER TO CHANGE THEIR PROCEDURES TO ENSURE JUSTICE HAPPENS THIS BILL IS NOT CONTROVERSIAL HAS NO OPPOSITION IN. THE DEFENSE BAR AND THE PROSECUTING BAR BUT THE DEFENSE BAR AND THE PLAINTIFFS BAR BOTH AGREE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT STEP FOR CALIFORNIA AT THIS POINT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER GALLAGHER YOUR RECOGNIZE. YES MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS- WE HAD THIS BILL AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND I DID SUPPORT IT THERE- THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY REGISTERED OPPOSITION AT THIS POINT- I DID RAISE A CONCERN THOUGH I. BUT WE CERTAINLY SEE WHERE IT COULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY AND NEEDED AND IN THIS PARTICULAR PANDEMIC. BUT I AM CONCERNED WITH GIVING. TOO MUCH POWER TO THE GIST JUDICIAL COUNCIL VIS A VIS PRESIDING SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES IN IN RESPECTIVE COUNTIES I AND HOW THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE ABUSING AND MAYBE BE. OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF. LOCAL COURT SYSTEMS AND I GUESS YOU KNOW WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION WHERE THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN. AS MUCH TIME FOR DELIBERATION TO HEAR FROM ALL OF OUR COURTS. I DO AT LEAST HAVE A CONCERN THAT THIS. YOU KNOW THIS COULD LEAD TO A BIGGER PROBLEM DOWN THE ROAD AND I GUESS WHENEVER WHENEVER WE ARE MOVING THINGS THROUGH VERY FAST. IF WE AT LEAST NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND SEE THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR. ALBUMS HERE I HAVE AYE AYES CERTAINLY HAVEN'T HEARD SPECIFICALLY FROM PRESIDING COURT JUDGES AND COUNTIES AT THIS POINT BUT I DON'T KNOW THIS IS REALLY ON THEIR RADAR EITHER- SO I JUST RAISE THAT AS A- POTENTIAL CONCERN AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I BE WITH HOLDING MY VOTE. TODAY. THANK YOU MISS GALLAGHER SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MR STONE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I HAVE IN FACT TALK TO SEVERAL PRESIDING JUDGES AND THEY ARE GRATEFUL. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO HAVE THIS AUTHORITY WITHIN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THIS BILL IS APPROPRIATELY WRITTEN TO DEAL WITH EMERGENCIES AND ALLOWS JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO WORK WITH THEIR LOCAL COURTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE IN THE WAY THAT THEY NEED TO. RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO GET AN EXECUTIVE ORDER OR GO THROUGH OTHER. DIFFICULT PROCESSES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE JUDGES THAT I'VE TALKED TO A IN A NUMBER OF PLACES ACROSS THE STATE FEEL IS VERY APPROPRIATE THE RIGHT STEP AND AGAIN THE DEFENSE BAR AND THE PLAINTIFFS BAR BOTH AGREE. THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO FOR ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY THAT I ASKED FOR I HAVE A- THANK YOU MISS STONE AND WITH THAT CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE.

UNDER CURRENT LAW CEDARS MUST GO THROUGH UCLA TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND OBTAIN THE PROPER PERMITS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO TRY TO EXPEDITE. THIS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS BY ALLOWING CEDARS TO DO THE EXACT SAME WORK BUT WITHOUT UCLA. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OTHER REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO OBTAIN A SPECIAL FACULTY PERMIT OR TO ESTABLISH ANY NEW ENTITIES THAT MUST BE REGULATED. THE SPECIALIZED FACULTY POSITIONS WHO HOLD THESE PERMITS TEACH PERFORM RESEARCH AND POSITIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTH CARE OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS BY IMPARTING THEIR EXPERTISE TO THE NEXT GENERATION.

WE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S CONTINUED EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WE CAN ONLY ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN RELEASED BY A SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS TO THE CAP SYSTEM. LET US BE CLEAR THAT UNDER THIS BILL THE PALM BROKERS WOULD LOCALLY COLLECT AND RETAIN ALL OF THE CUSTOMER INFORMATION WE CURRENTLY DO AND BE PART OF CURRENTLY TO CAPS. HOWEVER IF A MATRICULA CONSULAR WAS USED AS ID PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL BE RETAINED LOCALLY BY THE PROM BROKER.

THIS IS FILE ITEM SIXTY TWO AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN BY MS REYES QUICK READ. SOME PEOPLE TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN BY SOME MEMORY AS AN ACCOLADE TO CONVICTIONS. MISS RAY S. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENTED AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN WHICH ALLOWS FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATED ONE OF CDC OURS CONSERVATION FIRE CAMPS. TO APPLY FOR EXPUNGEMENT. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE VETTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION UNDER CDC ARE STRICT CRITERIA. AND THE ASSIST WITH PROTECTING COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE DURING OUR FIRE SEASONS WHICH HAVE BECOME MORE FREQUENT. AND DEADLIER. THIS BILL WAS RECENTLY AMENDED TO ADD JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND MIRRORED THE EXCLUSIONS CURRENTLY IN PLACE BY CDC OUR WHICH EXCLUDE. CERTAIN VIOLENT CRIMES SEX CRIMES AND ARSON. MEMBERS THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THE CONSERVATION CAMP PROGRAM HAVE LOW LEVEL CUSTODY STATUS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND- ON THE PATH OF REHABILITATION. CANNOT REACH TRUE REHABILITATION WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT. IF WE REALLY WANT TO BRING ABOUT CHANGEIN LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES. WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE SYSTEMIC POLICIES GOVERNING OUR COMMUNITIES. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN DOES JUST THAT IT WOULD ADD MUCH NEEDED BALANCED FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE VETTED BY CDC ARE AND SELECTED BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW LEVEL CUSTODY STATUS. THE GOOD BEHAVIOR AND OTHER FACTORS. IF WE ARE WILLING TO ALLOW INCARCERATED PERSONS TO VOLUNTEER AND HELP FIGHT FIRES PROTECTING LIVES AND PROPERTY WILL PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK. BUT WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO ALLOW THEM. AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE AN EXPUNGEMENT WHICH CAN BE GRANTED AFTER JUDICIAL REVIEW. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU MS RESPONSIBLE YOUR RECORD ASKED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I STAND IN AND TO THE AFRICAN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN AND I'D LIKE TO THANK MY FRIEND FROM SAN BERNADINO FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS HAVE A PATH TO OBTAINING MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT. THE INDIVIDUALS ARE PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CAMP PROGRAM PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE ALONGSIDE OUR STATE AND LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE LIVES AND PROPERTY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. OUR STATE CONTINUES TO FACE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES EVERY YEAR AND FIRE CAMP CREWS HELP SUPPORT AND AUGMENT THE EFFORT OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS. ADDING THOUSANDS OF WORK HOURS AND SAVING TAXPAYERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE PROCESS. BUT INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE IN THE PROGRAM FREQUENTLY FIND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO ACCESS OR OBTAIN MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES UPON THEIR RETURN RELEASE. FINDING MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT AND EARNING A LIVING WAGE IS ONEOF THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS POST RELEASE. AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO REMOVE BARRIERS THAT HINDER THEIR SUCCESS. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS REMOVING THE OBSTACLES THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRE CAMP PROGRAM AND FAITHFULLY SERVE THE STATE. FACED BY MAKING THEM ELIGIBLE TO HAVE THEIR RECORD EXPUNGED UPON THEIR RELEASE AND MEMBERS. WITH GOOD REASON WE GIVE ACCOLADES TO OUR FIRST RESPONDERS- WHEN THE WHEN FIRES HAPPEN EVERY TIME WE SEE A WILDFIRE OR A FIRE EVEN IN OUR URBAN AREAS. AND WE FORGET ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEHIND THE SCENES LIKE THESE FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS OR THE SIM CARD FOR IT INDIVIDUALS OR IN THE FIRE CAMP PROGRAM. AND WE OWE THEM A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO WE SHOULD BE ENTHUSIASTIC AND OUR RESPONSE ON THEIR BEHALF AND THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT SO I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN. NAMES BELOW MISTER VOEPEL YOUR RECOGNIZE I ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND- WAS A CO AUTHOR WITH MY NEIGHBOR. AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY. I ENDED UP IN THE MILITARY. ON A. HOW CAN I PUT THIS DIPLOMATICALLY UNDER- LESS THAN. FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES I'LL GO WITH THAT ONE. AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS DURING THE VIETNAM WAR. SO WHEN I ENDED UP IN A MILITARY ONLY THOUGHT OF MYSELF. BUT AFTER JOINING THE MILITARY TEAM. I ENDED UP THINKING OF ALL THE TEAM MATES AND THEN WENT TO WAR WE FOUGHT. WITH EACH OTHER TRYING TO WIN AND SAVE EACH OTHER NOW THAT'S THE WAY THIS WORKS TO YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT FIRES YOU HAVE TO JOIN THE TEAM. YOU GOT TO THINK IS SOMEBODY ELSE BESIDES YOURSELF WHICH IS WHAT GOT TO NET TROUBLE ANYWAY. SO THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL. IT WILL HELP MOTIVATE YOUNG PEOPLE AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE RUN AFOUL OF THE LAW LIKE IT DID ME. STOP AND THINK.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU IMAGE MCCARTY AND WITHOUT. CLIP OF NARAL. THE START OF ALL. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS OF THE DESIRE TO VOTE. THE CLARK WELL CLOSE ROLL TIDE THAT I FIFTY SEVEN NO ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO TAKE UP THE MAIN BUDGET BILL. THIS IS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE. SB. SEVENTY FOUR. CALGARY. SENATE BILL SEVENTY FOUR BY SENATOR MITCHELL WHEN OUR TO THE STATE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET BILL MISTER TECH EMAIL BUT- THANK YOU FOR SPEAKERS MY HONOR TO PRESENT OUR BUDGET BILL SB SEVENTY FOUR. THIS IS A TIME OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT BUDGET THAN WE THOUGHT WE'D PRESENT. WE SAW THE GOVERNOR RELEASED HIS PROPOSAL FIRST IN JANUARY. IN FACT WHEN WE RECESSED IN MARCH IT WAS. EVEN UNCERTAIN HOW WE WOULD BE VOTING ON THIS BUDGET BILL TODAY. WHETHER WE BE IN CHAMBERS WHETHER BE SOMEWHERE ELSE OFF SITE MAYBE VIEW TO EVEN BE IN. CAPITOL PARK. IN THIS BUDGET THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE ARE ASSUMING BUT I CAN'T REALLY SAY WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN. WHAT WILL HAPPEN. FIRST WE'RE ASSUMING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY YEARS OF. ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE GOOD BUFFETS. I THINK SO. THIS IS A BUDGET THAT WE ARE ASSUMING WE'RE GOING TO GET. FEDERAL AID. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A TRIGGER IN CASE THAT FEDERAL AID. DOESN'T COME. BUT HERE'S WHAT WE DO KNOW. I KNOW THAT FAMILIES LIKE MINE ARE ON EDGE ABOUT HOW WE WILL RESUME SCHOOL. IN THE SUMMER AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE UP FOR THE LEARNING LOSS THAT WE HAD EARLIER THIS YEAR. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE FAMILIES. WHO ARE. WORRIED ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE. AND WHETHER OR NOT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET. IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. BECAUSE NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO BE SENDING SOMEONE. TO A NURSING HOME. OR NOT HAVING SOMEBODY BE ABLE TO STAY. AT HOME. THE LAST WEEK. WE KNOW THE- MOST FAMILIES MY CAR'S CAN'T GO TO WORK WITH A CHILD CARE. BECAUSE MANY OF US ARE TO WORKING. TWO INCOME FAMILIES. BOTH PARENTS ARE WORKING. WE NEED A PLACE TO DROP OFF OUR CHILDREN IN ORDER TO. GO TO WORK. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. CHARTER DIDN'T TAKE RATE CUTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PRESERVE. THOSE SLOTS. BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TAKING CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. WE'RE GOING TO WORK. THIS IS I IMAGINE THE FIRST BUDGET OF MANY TOUGH BUDGETS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. SO THERE ARE CHOICES WE MADE THAT WORD PREFERABLE. WAS A LIKE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE WERE SAVING HOW MUCH MONEY WILL PUT% THE RAINY DAY FUND HOW MANY RESERVISTS WE HAD. WELL I THINK IT SEEMS THAT TODAY THE RAINY DAY HAS ARRIVED. SO THAT MONEY THAT. WE HAVE WORKED COLLECTIVELY AS THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT AWAY IN RESERVE. TO SAVE THAT MONEY. THIS FOLLY BEING USE BECAUSE NOW IS THAT TIME. THEY WERE DOING IT BECAUSE CALIFORNIANS TODAY NEED HELP MORE THAN EVER. WE ARE AT A TIME WHERE PEOPLE NEED TO THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THEIR SERVICES MORE THAN EVER. SO WE SHOULDN'T AS AN INSTITUTION AS A STATE RETREAT. IN FACT I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THE OPPOSITE WE HAVE TO GO HELP. THE WEATHER THAT IS HELPING. WITH VENTILATORS WITH MATH. WITH CLEANING SUPPLIES FOR OUR SCHOOLS. WITH US HELPING WITH HEALTH CARE WITH US HELPING WITH. ENSURING THAT WE ARE EXPEDITING THOSE UNEMPLOYMENT PLACEMENTS THAT PEOPLE NEED. THIS HELP THAT IS SORELY NEEDED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. WHEN WE WERE ALL HOME IN HERE IF MORE CONSTITUENTS WE HEARD ABOUT ALL THE PAIN THAT WAS GOING ON WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE WORK SMALL% BUSINESSES THAT WERE CLOSED. BUT PEOPLE WERE IN NEED. IN THIS BUDGET. THIS BUDGET TRIES TO CONTINUE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE IN NEED WHAT THE SAME TIME BEING FISCALLY SOUND FISCALLY UNBALANCED YES WE DO BORROW FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE BUDGET. YES WE DO TO FOR SOME PAYMENTS TO SCHOOLS. I WOULD RATHER DO THAT. THE START THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH CUTS. I WOULD RATHER DO THAT THAN TO CUTS IN HEALTHCARE. I WOULD RATHER DO THAT THE MAKE SURE THAT THERE WEREN'T CHILDCARE SLOTS AVAILABLE FOR WORKING FAMILIES. SO THIS BUDGET ON UP TO SAY IS A PERFECT BUDGET. IT'S NOT. I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T PRESIDED OVER ONE OF MY- FIVE YEARS THOSE BUDGET CHAIR I DON'T THINK I WILL IN ALL MY TIME THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THIS IS THE RIGHT BUDGET. FOR THIS TIME. THE BUDGET. THAT HELPS WORKING FAMILIES. IT'S A BUDGET THAT HELPS KIDS KEEP THEM IN SCHOOL IT'S A BUDGET THAT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DELIVER THOSE CRITICAL SERVICES THAT CALIFORNIA'S. ME SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB SEVENTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHANG MISTER OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES THERE IS ACTUALLY A LOT TO LIKE IN THE BUDGET THAT WE ARE VOTING ON TODAY THIS BUDGET REJECTS MOST OF THE EGREGIOUS PROBLEMS THAT WERE- IT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE. IT REJECTS THE TRANSFER OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AWAY FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT INTO THE GENERAL FUND THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE. IT CONVERTS. SIXTEEN A JUDICIAL OFFICER POSITIONS INTO SUPERIOR COURT JUDGESHIPS THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HELP WITH THE JUDICIAL SHORTFALL IT ESPECIALLY IN THE FASTEST GROWING PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. IT RESTORES FUNDING THE K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION OUR C. ISSUES IN OUR UC'S THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATELY DIVERTED. I IT KEEPS OPEN THE BARSTOW VETERANS HOME FOR WHICH I AM VERY GRATEFUL. I AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. THIS BUDGET REJECTS THE GOVERNOR'S ATTEMPT TO USURP THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY. TO OVERSEE STATE SPENDING HE HAD REQUESTED THE ABILITY TO APPROPRIATE OVER NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS REIMBURSEMENT WE'VE REJECTED THAT HE REQUESTED THE ABILITY TO APPROPRIATE ALONE. ALMOST THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN CORONA VIRUS SPENDING THAT WE ALSO REJECTED. COLLEAGUES THE LEGISLATURE HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE TO PLAY HERE IN PARTNERING WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO OVERSEE THAT SPEED SPENDING I'D LIKE TO COMMEND. OUR CHAIRMAN THE GENTLEMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE FOR HOLDING THE LINE ON THIS. AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPRESS MY HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THE LINE AS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR PROCEED. HOWEVER I ALSO HAVE SOME GREAT CONCERNS WITH THIS BUDGET. FIRST OF ALL THIS BUDGET APPROPRIATES MONEY TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE CAP INJURY PROGRAM. THESE CHANGES WOULD RAISE THE PRICE OF ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE TAXES ON CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. AND WHEN WE HEARD. THIS ITEM IN BUDGET COMMITTEE IT WAS VERY DISTURBING TO ME TO LEARN THAT MANY PEOPLE THE END OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF VIEW THE PURPOSE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO RAISE REVENUE WHICH WE ALL KNOW IT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF CAP AND TRADE. IS TO REGULATE THE EMISSION OF GREENHOUSE GASES IN CALIFORNIA REVENUE IS AN ANCILLARY BENEFIT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I BELIEVE THAT THIS BUDGET. IS STRUCTURALLY IRRESPONSIBLE WE HAVE A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT TO CLOSE THIS YEAR. THIS BUDGET CLOSES THAT THROUGH WHAT CAN ONLY BE CHARITABLY DESCRIBED AS BUDGETARY GIMMICKS. IT USES OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF DEFERRALS WHICH IS MERELY SAYING THAT THIS YEAR'S BUDGETS ALL ITEMS ARE GOING TO BE PAID ONE YEAR INTO NEXT YEAR SO THAT WE CAN SAY THAT THEIR NEXT YEAR'S ITEMS INSTEAD OF THIS YEAR'S SPENDING. THAT'S A RESPONSIBLE. THIS BILL THIS ABOUT BUDGET BILL HAS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF BORROWING. WHICH WE ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROHIBITED FROM DOING BUT WHAT THIS BUDGET DOES IS IT BORROWS FROM RESTRICTED FUND BALANCES TRANSFERS THAT MONEY INTO THE GENERAL FUND WITH THE PROMISED REPAIRED. LATER WITH INTEREST. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THINKING. IS THAT EVERYBODY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL OF OUR BUDGET CONSULTANTS EVERYONE AGREES THAT THIS IS A MULTI YEAR BUDGET EVENT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER STRUCTURAL DEFICIT TO DEAL WITH NEXT YEAR. AND ANY SPENDING THAT WE MAKE THISYEAR WE PUT OFF REPAYMENT OF THAT TO FUTURE YEARS IT'S JUST GONNA MAKE THE PROBLEM BIGGER FUTURE YEARS FROM NOW. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE NOT CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING BY HARDLY AT ALL. OF THAT FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFICIT. EVEN IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD WE GET NO MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE CUTTING STATE SPENDING IN THIS BUDGET BY LESS THAN EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. YOU DO THE MATH THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE BALANCED THE BUDGET 85% WITH GIMMICK. 15% WITH ACTUAL REDUCTIONS TO STATE GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND COLLEAGUES I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO HAVE OCCURRED CONVERSATION ABOUT CUTTING FUNDING. IT'S DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT FUNDS WE SHOULD REDUCE SPENDING ON. BUT WE ARE THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE THEM THIS YEAR. WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE EVEN MORE PAINFUL CUTS IN THE FUTURE. FOR THAT REASON I ORIGINAL VOTE. THINK OF A SHOWING OF CA MR LEVINE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVENTY FOUR WE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY CLEAR EYED. IN OUR APPROACH TO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THAT THIS AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID FROM BIG BIG BEAR SAID COULD BE A MULTI YEAR. BUDGET EVENT THIS IN FACT COULD BE A MULTI BUDGET EVENT YEAR. TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE THE STEWARDS THAT OUR SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS DEPEND UPON. AND WHILE IT WOULD BE EASY TO SAY. THAT THIS ISN'T THE BUDGET THAT WE WANT TO PASS OR I DIDN'T RUN FOR OFFICE TO PASS BUDGETS LIKE THIS. AS SOMEONE WHO FIRST SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. HOW TO CUT MID YEAR. THE STAFF THAT I KNEW AND THE SERVICES THAT THEY WERE PROVIDING THAT PEOPLE DEPENDED UPON. AND I SAW THAT FIRST HAND. THIS IS PRECISELY WHY I RAN FOR THE ASSEMBLY. THIS IS A TEST FOR US. IN EIGHT YEARS LATER. AFTER SOCKING AWAY SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE RAINY DAY OR RIVER RESERVES. WE ARE PASSING THIS TEST WHEN WE PASS THIS BUDGET. THE OUTLOOK IS MURKY WHETHER YOU'RE A FAMILY BUSINESS OR ANY GOVERNMENT AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. AND SO WHEN WE PASS THIS BUDGET TODAY WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE. EXERCISE THE DISCIPLINE AND THE STORE CHIP THAT WAS ASKED OF US WHEN THOSE OF US THAT WERE FIRST ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE PROMISE THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS RIGHT THAT WE WILL BE STORED OF THE MONEY AND THE PROGRAMS FOR OUR STATE. AND THAT SO MANY OF YOU HAVE JOINED US TO DO EACH AND EVERY BUDGET YOUR SENSE THANK YOU. DOCTOR ARAMBULA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IN THIS CHAMBER TODAY. MY FATHER WHO SERVED IN THIS SAME SEAT HAS GIVEN ME A LOT OF ADVICE. AMONG THAT ADVICE IS ALWAYS TO REMEMBER THE PEOPLE IN YOUR DISTRICT. E. HALL. REMEMBER WHERE YOU LAY YOUR HEAD AT NIGHT IS WHAT HE SAYS TO ME. THAT IS WHY I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BUDGET OUTLINED HERE TODAY. IT IS NOT PERFECT AND THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE BUT I KNOW THAT PUTTING FORWARD A PROPOSAL THAT ENSURES THAT OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS ARE PROTECTED. AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED THE MOST. WE HAVE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY DURING A TIME OF FISCAL STRESS. AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR ADMINISTRATION TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL PROVIDE THE SHORT IMMEDIATE RELIEF THAT OUR FAMILIES NEED WE WILL ALSO HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THE LONG TERM RESILIENCY THAT OUR STATE NEEDS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A HEALTHY RECOVERY. AS IN MEDICINE THE HEALTH OF THE WHOLE BODY. DEPENDS ON THE STRENGTH OF EACH ORGAN. I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO SIT ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND I'VE HEARD FROM THE MOTHERS WHO ARE CALLING ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN. FROM THE CARE GIVERS WHO ARE CALLING ON BEHALF OF THEIR PARENTS AND DEPENDENCE. FROM THE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND HEALTH POLICY ADVOCATES CALLING ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO HAVE NO VOICE AND I HEAR THEM LOUD AND CLEAR. ADVOCATES HAVE SAID NOTHING ABOUT US WITHOUT US AND TODAY'S VOTE MOVES THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD. AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS MEETING OUR STATE'S OBLIGATIONS AND I WOULD URGE YOUR AYE VOTE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS YOU KNOW THIS IS GONNA BE THE- FASTEST BUDGET PROCESS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY TENURE HERE. AND I THINK WE ALL NEED TO ASK OURSELVES IS A FRAMEWORK. REALLY WHAT OUR PEOPLE DESERVE. ARE WE RUSHING THIS THING SIMPLY SO WE DON'T HIT A DEADLINE SO WE CAN GET PAID. NOW THERE ARE PARTS OF THIS. THAT I LIKE PARTS THAT I'VE FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL ON ON BUDGET SO ONE FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING MASSIVE CUTS TO OUR HEALTH CARE TO OUR FOLKS WITH DISABILITIES. I AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE WE'RE DOING TO KEEP EDUCATION A PRIORITY. WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN INTO THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT. YOU CAN CALLING GIMMICKS YOU CAN CALL IT. THE AGE OLD CONVERSATION OF. STEALING FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL BUT IN REALITY WERE STEALING FROM OUR GRAND KIDS IN OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CONCERNS ME DEEPLY. BECAUSE WHY THIS PATCHWORK BLUEPRINT MIGHT WORK FOR THIS YEAR. IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE. WE HAVE THINGS IN THIS. THAT ARE GOING TO COST ARE BUSINESSES THAT ARE TRYING TO RECOVER FROM COVERT NINETEEN. TRYING TO RECOVER FROM RIOTS AND LOOTING. IT'S GOING TO HARM THEM. WE HAVE THINGS IN HERE TO READ DRAW. OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHICH FRANKLY PISSES ME OFF. BECAUSE I'VE FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL. GT PERSECUTED ELECTION OVER IT. BECAUSE WE HAD A PROGRAM SET UP THAT WAS DESIGNED TO DWINDLE OUT NO WE WANT TO READ DRAW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. BUT WE'LL FIND OUT IN ANOTHER TRAILER BILL. IN THE FUTURE WE'LL SEE. MEMBERS. FAMILIES DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN US HAVING A SYSTEMATIC WAY THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE THEIR COST OF LIVING. WHETHER TRYING TO RECOVER FROM RECESSION. WE OWE IT TO THEM WE OWE IT TO OUR KIDS YOU KNOW WHAT I TELL MY KIDS ALL THE TIME KEY THING GUYS IF YOU KNOW BETTER. DO BETTER. MEMBERS I ASK THE SAME OF YOU THANK YOU. MR FRAZIER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. WELL WE'VE ALL. NOTICE THAT A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN HOW WE DO BUSINESS HERE RECALL THAT NINETEEN. AND HOW FRAGILE THE ECONOMY CAN BE. DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC I WANT TO APPLAUD OUR CHAIR. HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND ALSO OUR CHAIR OF THE SENATE FOR MAKING A STAND FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IN LEADING THE WAY WITH THEIR STAFF TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE NOT CUTTING. WHEN WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING. BUT I'LL REMIND MY COLLEAGUES AS YOU KNOW AND I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. THE I. D. D. POPULATION. IS PART OF A PROCESS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE. TO SUPPORT. THE CENSUS GROWS EVERY YEAR THE POPULATION GROWS EVERY YEAR COST NOT GO DOWN ON SUPPORTING THIS POPULATION. ADULT DAYCARE CENTERS ADULT HOUSING. ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH SUPPORT OF THIS POPULATION NEEDS TO BE SOME KIND OF LINE ITEM LIKE WE DO FOR EDUCATION I CAN PROP NINETY EIGHT KIND OF SOURCE OF FUNDING. THE COST IS AND GO DOWN. WE DO MAIS THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AS A COST SAVINGS AND MADE THE PROMISE THAT WE WOULD TAKE CARE OF THIS POPULATION IN THESE ADULT. HOMES. BUT CUTS DRAMATICALLY AFFECT THE PROVIDERS. WHERE THEY CANNOT PROVIDE SERVICES IN AGAIN YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT COST SHIFTING. IN THE IN THE BUDGET WILL SHIFT THIS CROSSOVER THAT SOMETIMES IS STEPPING OVER NOT A DIME TO PICK UP A ARE SENT OVER DOLLAR TO PICK UP A DIME. EXCUSE ME FOR THAT. UNDERSTANDING THAT SOMETIMES IF YOU CUT A SERVICE HERE AKASHI DRAMATICALLY MORE DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE OF INSTITUTIONAL CARE THAT'S. OF DAY CARE PROGRAM NOW YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA ALSO HIS ONLY FUNDED THROUGH THE ADA. WHOSE KIDS THESE KIDS NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING ALSO. OKAY WE DO NEED TO FIND A BETTER WAY OF SUPPORTING THIS POPULATION THEY DEPEND ON US. THEIR PARENTS THEIR FAMILIES DEPEND ON US THE MORTALITY RATE ON MARRIAGE WITH A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD IS 85% COLLEAGUES. YOU HAVE A LOT OF SINGLE MOMS OUT THERE. FIGHTING CHILD AND SOMETIMES A I CAN'T MAKE IT WITHOUT HELP. THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE DOING ALL THEY CAN BUT WE HAVE PROVIDE SERVICE PROVIDERS THE I MEAN BECAUSE WE THE CAN THE CONSTITUENT CASE MANAGERS. UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED CASES PER YEAR. OF NOT BEING ABLE TO GIVE THAT FULL ATTENTION. THAT FAMILY NEEDS WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR SYSTEM OF CARE FOR THIS POPULATION. BUT I NEED SUPPORT FROM EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU IN BOTH HOUSES. TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS POPULATION DEPENDS ON US. THEY DON'T HAVE ANYBODY ELSE THEY DON'T HAVE. AT ABSOLUTE WONDERFUL LOBBYIST TO BE ABLE TO PROPOSE TO VIEW THEIR PROPONENTS. THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN WAY TO GENERATE REVENUE. WE CAN'T LOOK AT THEM AS A LIABILITY. THEIR VALUE IN LIFE. THEIR GLORY THEIR HAPPINESS IS ALL. UNIQUE AND WONDERFUL AND WE NEED TO HAVE GENEROSITY IN OUR HEARTS. TO SUPPORT THIS POPULATION I ASK IN FUTURE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS THAT WE MAKE A STAND. AND WE MAKE IT BIG WE SHOW THEM THAT WE CARE. THIS BUDGET I'M URGING AYE VOTE BUT IN FUTURE BUDGETS YOU'RE GONNA SEE ME. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER MR KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS THE GOVERNOR HAS REPEATEDLY ASKED US TO MEET THIS MOMENT. AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY HAVE. MAKING UNTHINKABLE SACRIFICES IN DURING IMMEASURABLE HARDSHIPS. BUT THIS BUDGET I FEAR IS MISSING THE MOMENT ENTIRELY. THE ORDER OF THE DAY IS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY YET SOMEHOW WERE ALLUDING BOTH. AS TO THE ECONOMY YOU'D THINK THAT AFTER SHUTTING IT DOWN FOR MONTHS AFTER SHUTTING SMALL BUSINESSES DOWN FOR MONTHS WE DO EVERYTHING WE CONCEIVABLY COULD TO HELP THEM AND INDEED THE GOVERNOR DID SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP SMALL BUSINESSES THE FLOW. YEAH THIS BUDGET DOES THE OPPOSITE. REGULATIONS ARE RATCHETED UP NOT REALLY ROCK NOT RELIEVED TAXES ARE RAISED NOT CAUGHT LIABILITIES EXPANDED NOT LIMITED AB FIVE IS REINFORCED NOT REPEALED. WE HAVE FIVE POINT THREE MILLION UNEMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS THAT'S MORE THAN THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF TWENTY EIGHT STATES MORE THAN EVER WE NEED A BUDGET THAT PROMOTES WORK AND SUPPORTS WORKERS. YET EVERY PROPOSAL THAT I AND SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES OFFER TO DO THIS EVAPORATED INTO THIN AIR NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY BACKS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR PP LOANS FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS HISTORIC REGULATORY RELIEF LIABILITY PROTECTIONS TAMING THE MET THE MENACE OF PAGA. THESE COMMON SENSE IDEAS WHICH COULD DO SO MUCH GOOD FOR SO MANY PEOPLE AT A TIME OF SUCH PERIL WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET. AND DIDN'T EVEN RECEIVE A FORUM FOR PUBLIC INPUT OR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION. THE SECOND IMPERATIVE WE FACE CONCERNS THE STATE'S FINANCES. GRAPPLING WITH WHAT COULD BE A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT A GOOD PLACE TO START WOULD HAVE BEEN THE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WE'VE ADDED TO THE BUDGET. OVER THE LAST DECADE. STRIKINGLY ALL OF THIS ADDED MONEY HAS PRODUCED LITTLE DISCERNIBLE SOCIAL BENEFIT. DESPITE SIXTY FOUR BILLION AN ADDITIONAL MEDI CAL SPENDING RESEARCHERS AT THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH DID NOT DETECT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENT HEALTH. AFTER THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN EDUCATION SPENDING THE NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS FOUND THE CALIFORNIA'S EIGHTH GRADE MATH AND READING SCORES CONTINUE TO DECLINE. WITH SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS MORE SPENDING ON SOCIAL SERVICES THE CENSUS BUREAU REPORTS CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF POVERTY IN THE NATION. THREE BILLION DOLLAR RISING CORRECTIONAL SPENDING HAS ACCOMPANIED A POPULATION. AND IT JUST THE CLASS TWO YEARS WE SPENT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS MORE ON HOMELESSNESS ONLY TO SEE THIS WORST IN THE NATION TRAGEDY GET MUCH WORSE WE TALKED A LOT. ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE SPENDING WE TALKED VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE VALUE OF THAT SPENDING. WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY REACHING THE CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED IT RATHER THAN JUST PROPPING UP POWERFUL INTERESTS IN DIFFERENT SECTORS SECTORS AND THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN SPENDING MONEY. AND SPENDING MONEY WISELY REALLY MATTERS IT'S NOT A ONE CHRISTIAN MATTER FOR BUDGET HAWKS IT REALLY MATTERS ON A HUMAN LEVEL. IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SMALL BUSINESS REMAINING THE HEART OF A COMMUNITY OR CLOSING ITS DOORS PERMANENTLY. BETWEEN A YOUNG PERSON GOING OFF TO COLLEGE OR DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL. BETWEEN A PERSON EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TURNING THEIR LIFE LIFE AROUND OR DYING ON OUR STREETS. THAT IS THE GRAVITY OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND THIS YEAR MORE THAN EVER REPORT SHOULD HAVE PULLED US STRONGLY TOWARDS SMART AND COMPASSIONATE CHOICES. BUT I WILL CLOSE WITH A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR I WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE- THE LEGISLATURE TAKING THE GOVERNOR TO TASK IN IMPORTANT WAYS- ON HIS ATTEMPTS TO AMASS A GREATER AUTHORITY IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AT OUR EXPENSE. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE A LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP IN THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT LIE AHEAD TO HOLD FAST TO THAT POSITION AND DIE IN THE I TO HEED THE ADVICE OF OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S TO YOU DOES THAT LESLIE GUARD THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY. THERE WAS KELLY MISTER COOPER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS SPEAKERS MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS EXCUSE ME WELL I THINK MR TING IN BUT STAFFER FOR DOING THAT A HARD JOB IT'S A TOUGH BUDGET IS A SUB TO YOU SEE THEIR WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND- THERE'S THINGS YOU LIKE ABOUT THIS BUDGET THINGS WE DO MUST INCLUDE BUT ONE THING. WE NEED ON MY COLLEAGUES THE HEALTH RELIGIOUS BLACK CAUCUS SPOKE ABOUT- EARLIER THE VINCE SEE NINETY NASH IS GOING ON AT ALL WORSE. IT IS LAW TRAINING WE WANTED TO THINGS IN MAY IT BETTER BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT GETTING BY ON THE CHEAP AND THAT'S WHAT PART IS DOES WITH PIECE OFF TRAINING IN THE BUDGET IT IS THE DISTANCE. SO WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE CHANGE THINGS THE IMPORTANT THINGS IN THIS BUDGET WE TALK ABOUT DE ESCALATION FOR THAT NATION WHY TALK ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS IN RACIAL PROFILING FOR THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN COMMUNITY POLICING CULTURAL DIVERSITY WE TALK ABOUT THOSE VIGNETTE. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE OUR OFFICERS TRAINED ON DISTANCE. ON IT WERE YOU GO THROUGH AND CLICK. BUT LET'S FACE. THAT'S WE WILL IT WILL IT WILL SEE BUT SINCE THE PAYING ATTENTION GET MUCH MORE OUT OF IT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE ON THE ON THE BY IN THE MAIL YOU CAN YOU LIVE WITH THE TECH TALK ON THE- SO IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD TO FOR ALL. TO DO HE WON BETTER OFF YOU GOT IN ON IT YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE AND BY DOING LEARNING WE DO THE PUBLIC THE SERVICE. WE ALSO DO. ARE STILL THE CAN. THOSE OFFICERS SERVICE. SO IT WILL DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THIS. THIS SO. TO CHIU. IN THEIR- IT STARTS WITH. THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE TRAINING. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE MOST PEERS IN CALL THE- OF DIFFERENT RACE. DIFFERENT SEXES. YOU CAN HEAR THERE'S- AND MUCH MORE. THAN SITTING AT HOME. IN YOUR OFFICE. CLICKING THAT BY. OVER IN AGAIN WITH THE SUPPORT. IT MAKES NO SO. BUSH WITH WHAT'S ON TODAY. AND IN TO CHANGE OTHER. IF YOU'RE THIS BUDGET AS IT IS IN WE DO THIS TRAINING. IT DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THE SITUATION FIND OURSELVES IN NOW IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT GONNA BE CHANGE OVERALL. THIS IS A BIG PART OF IT. TRAININGS FOR TO FOREMOST TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE. THERE WAS COOPER MISS GARCIA IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I WANT I'M ALWAYS SO HARD WORK BETTER. I CHAIR HAS DONE WITH THE LIMIT I'M IN. AND A LACK OF REAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVENUE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GENERATING THIS YEAR- AND BECAUSE WE HAVE. LIMITED INFORMATION WE KNOW THAT THE LEGALIZATION THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING ON- THROUGH THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THAT WE'RE HERE IN SESSION. WITH THAT I WANT TO BRING UP A COUPLE POINTS ARE IMPORTANT TO MY DISTRICT BUT JUST TO COMMUNITIES COLOR IN GENERAL AS WE CONTINUE WITHIN. I THINK THE BUDGET CAR ONLY REPRESENTS OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW POINTS WHERE WILL BEGIN TO HAVE THAT COMMITMENT HERE AND THEN. AND GOVERNOR OFFICE. FIRST OF ALL AS WE DISCUSSED EDUCATE. FUND THE AVERAGE. TO LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT. LANCE I EQUITY. AND I QUALITY. WE KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE BLACK OR STEVEN. YOU DON'T START IN THE SAME THAT AS YOU MIGHT CAO. AND BECAUSE IN NINETEEN THAT'S ONLY ME LIKE A BROWN KIDS FOR THEIR BE. STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME. HAVE A STORE CONFERENCE AT A TO. AND EDUCATION GAPS. BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND WHITE COUNTY. ACCORDING TO MY CAN SEIZE. PRE COVERT THE AVERAGE BLACK HISPANIC MAY ROUGHLY YEARS WE- THE AVERAGE WHITE ONE AND LOW INCOME CITIZENS TO BE ON THE RIVER A TOP. AND BECAUSE THE COLD AND CAN TAKE BRIDGE THAT BLACK STUDENTS WILL FURTHER WILL FALL FOR THE BAHAI THE PHONE TEMP. BLACK AND BROWN KIDS SO THEY REALLY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REACH HER TRUE POTENTIAL LIKE THE RIGHT KIND. AND WHILE WE MAKE SOME CUTS. I WOULD WITH OUR BY CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE. THAT ALLOW HOMES WILL CHARGE THE PAPER TO DISNEY. LEGAL FOR RIDING. UNDER THE PRIEST OF EDUCATION ENRICHMENT. IT'S A WHOLE TEAM WE INSURE COMMUNITY. WE CAN ANSWER SCHOOL THINK REYES MINE CAN CLOSE THE DID DIVIDE. WE CAN INSURE COMMITTEES OF MY LIKE MY CONTINUE BE THERE. FOUR HUNDRED A REGULAR BASIS. AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT EQUITY I WILL BE THINK ABOUT CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE FIRST. SECOND AS WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS CARE. I BE CONTINUE TILL AT IT WOULD AN EQUITY LANCE. MAKING HAS BEEN READ MICHAEL BUT NINETY. FOR THE NINETEEN HAS FOR THE MAGNIFY THE VISUAL RECEBER AND I'LL HARKIS STUFF WE CAN'T TO IGNORE THEM FOR TO THE- OF. HEALTH THE NORTH MORE QUE THAN I OTHER BE GROUPS MY ABOUT AFRICAN IN. MAKE UP ON SIX FOR. OF THE POPULATION BUT THEY NEARLY TECH TEN OF THE THAT. WE LOOK AT THE NUMBERS RALLY COUNTY THE CITY OF A LOT OF MY IN AFTER ONE OF THE. THESE COMMUNITIES FIRST AND IS THAT THE MOST IMPACTED WE DON'T JUST SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING EQUAL CUTS ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE IT'S VERY AN EQUITABLE AND I'M FREE TO COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT OCCURRED ARE. BEING BURDEN DISPROPORTIONATELY MICHAEL THAT. AND IF YOU THINK OF HEALTH CARE WILL HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT THEIR THAT WE BREATHE. AND THE REALITY IS THAT A LOT OF FOLKS ARE DATING MY COMMUNITY. NOT JUST COULD BECAUSE WE LACK ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. BUT BECAUSE WE'RE CONSTANTLY THE- REALLY BAD HARMFUL AIR OUT THERE. AND SO WE KNOW THAT BROWN AND BLACK PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN LIVE IN HIGHLY POLITICAL- COMMUNITIES. REFLECT RECENT HARVARD STUDY. THE PEOPLE THAT CALL IN NINETEEN WHO LIVE IN THE U. S. REGIONS WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OR POLLUTION. I'M MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM THE DISEASE THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND LESS POLLUTED AREAS. WITH THE CITY OF THE LORD AT NEW THAT'S IN THE 5% MOST POLLUTED. AIR OF THE STATE IT'S REALLY SCARY. COMPOUNDING IT ALREADY- ON. OVER BURDEN AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. AND SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS LIKE AV SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH IDENTIFY HOT HOT THE POLLUTION AND CREATE COMMUNITY DRIVEN ACTION PLANS. THIS YEAR WE ARE MAKING A MODEST INVESTMENT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PROGRAM BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN YOU START LOOKING FOR TO STAY NOBLE STORES OF FUNDING I THOUGHT A CAP AND TRADE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR INTO THEM EQUITABLY. OF IN NINETEEN HAS SIMPLY MAGNIFIED THE URGENCY TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN ALL MY LIFE. THIRTY SECONDS. AND I ALSO WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT WE MUST REFORM THE DEPARTMENT OF TOPICS. AND WE'RE DOING THAT SLOWLY BUT I HOPE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WE- HURRY UP AND WE DID A LITTLE BIT QUICKER WE HAVE AB NINE NINE FIVE IN THE SENATE. THAT IS THE NEGOTIATED FOR FOUR YEARS. SUPPORT FROM BOTH INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. WITHOUT THEIR AND HAS BEEN PRIVATIZED BY THE ADMINISTRATION YET. THIS IS THE TIME THAT WE'RE GONNA STAY. THAT WE MATTER THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MATTER. THEN I PLEDGE ANY TO REFLECT THAT IS AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO LOOK AT EQUITY- HOLD AND HOW WE RAISE REVENUE AND WE SPEND THAT AND HOW WE MAKE UP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. MS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. IN EXPLAINING WHY WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BUDGET SOME MEMBERS OF OUR CAUCUS HAVE VERY SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE VARIOUS LINE ITEMS IN THIS NEARLY THOUSAND PAGE DOCUMENT. MY COLLEAGUES ARE RIGHT THAT THIS BUDGET CONTAINS SOME VERY PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS INCLUDING CONTINUING TO FUND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. TENS OF MILLIONS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE HARMFUL AB FIVE LEGISLATION. FAILING TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT CAME TO LIGHT IN COLVIN REGARDING SAFETY IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. END OF COURSE SPENDING CUTS THAT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKEN OUR HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ACCESS TO CARE. THE BUDGET ALSO CONTAINS LAUDABLE COMPONENTS INCLUDING SOME PROTECTIONS FOR SENIORS AND THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED RESTORING OPTIONAL MEDI CAL SERVICES PROTECTING THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT AND INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON IS THE BROKEN PROCESS THAT HAS LED US TO THIS BUDGET. UNTIL TODAY NOT A SINGLE VOTE WAS TAKEN ON THIS BUDGET THERE WERE NO SUBCOMMITTEE VOTE NO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. ONLY TOKEN PRO FORMA PUBLIC INPUT WITH US WAS ALLOWED AND WHEN IT WAS SPEAKERS WILL RUST AND ENDED UP FRUSTRATED. MEMBERS OF THIS BODY AND THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S WE REPRESENT OR OUT OF THE PROCESS BEFORE THIS MOMENT FOR EXAMPLE. OUR LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS HAD FOUR MINUTES THAT WE COULD PRESENT ISSUES OF CONCERN ESPECIALLY FROM. OUR CONSTITUENTS. A SO WHAT WE SAW WAS. THAT ON BEHALF OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE REPRESENT WE CLEARLY DIDN'T HAVE A VOICE. THIS IS NOT HOW DEMOCRACY SHOULD OPERATE FOR THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE BEING SHOT OUT OF THE PROCESS ARE YOUR JOURNAL FULL. AMOS WATER MISTER COOLEY YOUR RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. COLLEAGUES I. AM PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I FIND IT INTERESTING YOU KNOW I STARTED MY CAREER IN THIS BILL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. I'VE SEEN MANY A DOWNTURN COME AND GO LAWMAKERS GOVERNOR'S FIGHTING A CALAMITOUS TIME THIS. JERRY BROWN DEUKMEJIAN A HUNDRED DAY DELAY IN PASSING A BUDGET. IT WILL SERVE. YOU KNOW THESE ARE NOT THE VOTES ACTION WHERE WE WANT TO BE HERE. AND WHEN I REFLECT UPON THIS BUDGET THIS CALAMITOUS FALL IN REVENUES THIS NEED TO RESPOND. I ACTUALLY RECALL. YEAH WE'VE HAD OTHER BUDGETS. IN TIMES OF RISING REVENUE. AND WE STAND AROUND AND TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES. AND IT'S EASY TO STAND UP FOR THAT AND PASSED THAT ONE REVENUES ARE SURE G. I JUST SEE A BUDGET LIKE THIS IS A TIME WHEN. IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT. YOU END UP ASKING CELLS IN MY PREPARED TO BE ALL IN ON MY DEMOCRATIC VALUES. DO WE BELIEVE. THAT EVEN IN HARSH FINANCIAL TIMES. DOING WHAT WE CAN WERE INVEST IN THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS THE DISADVANTAGED THE AT RISK. THE FOSTER YOUTH I WEAR MY AFTER YOUTH RIBBON TODAY BECAUSE JUNE. DO WE BELIEVE THAT INVEST IN THESE LIVES IS THE BEST STEP WE CAN TAKE. TO ENSURE THE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS TIME OF TROUBLE. THE CALIFORNIA BE STRENGTHENED COMING OUT OF THE. THE PRAYER TODAY TALKED ABOUT PLANET GREENER SEAT IN HAVING A- OUTSTANDING YIELD. AND I DO THINK THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. WHEN THINGS SEEM IN SUCH DIRE CONDITION. TO PLOD AWAY AND INVEST IN THE LIVES OF THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MOST AT RISK. AND DEPEND UPON WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO BRING FORWARD COPPING TOGETHER AS BUDGET. FOR THE LONGEST TIME IN PUBLIC LIFE I'VE ALWAYS LIKED WHAT THE PROFFER AS A HAD TO SAY ABOUT WHERE THERE'S A GOOD KING. I J. THIRTY TWO IT CAME WILL ROTH RIGHTEOUS AND EVERY PERSON. SHALL BE LIKE STREAMS OF WATER IN THE DESERT LIKE TO SHADOW OF A GREAT ROCK IN A WEARY LAND. IT IS A VERY ODD PICKED. UP TO THINK THAT. LEADERSHIP CAN BE REFLECTED IN A ROCK ON THE LANDSCAPE. IT JUST GETS THE SUN BEATING THE HECK OUT OF IT. BUT BECAUSE IT'S TAKING THAT HE TO CREATE SAFE SPACE. THIS TO ME IS A SIMILE. OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY THE ECONOMY IS THAT HARSH SUN. BEATING ON PEOPLE INTO IN OUR REVENUES. AND HOW WE INTERPOSE THE BULK OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPENDING TO MAKE SAFE PLACE FOR PEOPLE I THINK THAT IS THE MOMENT ANDI ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE WE NEED TO FOCUS. ON BEING ALL IN ON DEMOCRATIC VALUES STAND UP FOR PEOPLE OF MOST AT RISK OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MORE ACCESS TO CAPITAL HAVE MORE ABILITY TO ABSORB SHOCK AND WORK THINGS THROUGH. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY MUCH ON THE MARGIN AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE NEED TO BE AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS TO MORE WHICH IS UNLIKE ANYTHING ANY OF US HAVE SEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER COLLEY MISTER BRO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MEMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO BE RECOGNIZED PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW MISTER BRO YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I FIRST WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIR FROM SAN FRANCISCO OR VICE CHAIR FROM BIG BEAR AND ALL THE STAFF THAT WORKED ON THIS FRAMEWORK. I SAT THROUGH ALL THE SUB COMMITTEE HEARINGS IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS GOING BACK TO APRIL TWENTIETH. HEARING FROM THE LA- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND REALLY NO ONE HAD A LOT OF ANSWERS IT WAS A LOT OF SPECULATION SO. I UNDERSTAND THIS FRAMEWORK TODAY IS A SNAPSHOT IN TIME- AND THAT'S NOT DUE TO ANYBODY'S FAULT. AND I BELIEVE THAT WERE REALLY HERE- TO MEET THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL KNOW MORE AFTER THE JULY FIFTEEN TAX DEADLINE TO SEE WHAT REVENUES. COME INTO THE STATE AND THIS MAY BE A YEAR US ARE. CALLING FROM CENTER FELL SAID MULTI BUDGET YEAR- WE MAY HAVE AN AUGUST THROUGH THE IN THIS YEAR- I'M GONNA BE A NO TODAY JUST BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN TAXES ON ALL BUSINESSES. BUT I I'M FIRMLY BELIEVE WILL BE BACK CHARTER OUR PENCILS A- THANK PRO MISS. YOUR RECORD ASSN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THE COLLEAGUES TODAY I RISE SOMEWHAT NERVOUSLY BECAUSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES THAT I MIGHT FACE OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM AFTER TAKING THIS VOTE TODAY. BUT AS WE ALL DID WE GET INTO PUBLIC SERVICE FOR A REASON. AND FOR MY BEFORE MY TIME HERE I SPENT NINE YEARS ON THE RECEIVING END OF SOME PRETTY BAD BUDGET YEARS AND DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE IN THIS ROOM. AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. WE'RE LITERALLY WE PENCILLED OUR SOLUTIONS DOWN TO THE NICKEL. TO KEEP STAFF ON PAYROLL TO KEEP CUTS ON CLASSROOMS. AND TO CONTINUE OUR OBLIGATION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. AS I PUZZLED THROUGH THIS DECISION ABOUT TODAY AND HOW IT AYE REPROACH THIS REALLY IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE'RE ALL INVESTED IN HERE TOGETHER. IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO VALUES. SO I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING I AM GRATEFUL TO THOSE OF YOU WHO PLACED A VALUE ON SAVINGS. IN PRIOR LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS. THAT ARE PROVIDED A RAINY DAY FUND FOR US TO DRAW FROM. TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE THE NEEDS OF OUR PUBLIC. IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS AND TO KEEP CUTS FROM BEING AS EXTREME AS THEY MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT. WE VALUE A BALANCED BUDGET IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONLY REQUIRED OF US BUT WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT IN DOWN DEBT. TO THE GENERATIONS WHO COME AFTER THE US AND THAT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AND AS THE OPPOSITION HAS RISEN AND SAID I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AS A MEMBER. ABOUT PROCESS IN THIS BODY. AND I REGRET THAT I WON'T BE HERE IN FUTURE SESSIONS TO SPEAK TO THAT. BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE IS MORE WORK WE COULD DO TO BE DELIVERED OF. ABOUT CUTS WE CAN MAKE AN ABOUT GROWTH TO GOVERNMENT THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND WORTHWHILE AND WORTH THE INVESTMENT. BUT FINALLY IN TAKING THIS VOTE. THE REASON THAT I GOT INTO GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN WITH. WAS TO DO THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GOOD. FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AT HAND. I THINK THIS BUDGET REFLECTS THAT. I KNOW IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR MANY OF US. BUT TODAY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BUDGET FOR THAT REASON THANK YOU. DAVIS WITH MISS RACE IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THIS IS DEMOCRACY. THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY. IS THAT WE HAVE NUMBERS THAT ARE THE NUMBERS THAT WE WERE EXPECTING BEFORE. THANK GOODNESS WE HAD A RAINY DAY FUND THAT WAS SET ASIDE. FOR SUCH A DAY IS THIS. AND I THINK OUR CHAIRMAN OF FINANCE ARE CHAIRED BUDGET. FOR ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS. WE JUST EXPERIENCE THE EFFECTS OF A PANDEMIC SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER HAD TO SEE BEFORE. WE ALSO ASKED CALIFORNIA ASTOR BUSINESSES TO CLOSE DOWN TO FLATTEN THE CURVE. SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. AND WE'VE SEEN DEATH. LIKE WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THERE BEEN COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROCESS ITSELF. I APPRECIATE THAT EVEN WITH THIS SHORTENED PROCESS. OUR OUR CHAIR WAS AVAILABLE TO US. QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY I THINK OUR VICE CHAIR FIRST COMMENTS AS WELL I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THAT THEIR VOICE SURE TALKS ABOUT TO THE POSITIVES OF THIS BUDGET. EVEN IF THE END RESULT IS NOT GOING TO BE WHAT THE REST OF US WHAT. WHAT I WOULD WANT TO. IT'S NOT AN EASY BUDGET THE CUTS THE DEFERRALS REJECTIONS SUMMER POSITIVE AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED SOMEONE NEGATIVE AS SOME OF YOU HAVE HAVE HAVE NOTED. I'M THANKFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS BODY AND IN THE SENATE AS WELL. GLAD THAT AS I MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE THE LARGEST RAINY DAY RESERVE SIXTEEN BILLION IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. LARGER THAN THE ENTIRE BUDGET OF MANY STATES IN OUR NATION. LAST YEAR I INTRODUCED AB FIFTEEN NINETY THREE TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT TO IMMIGRANTS. THE FILE WHAT THE ITUNES NUMBER INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. THE EITC IS ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT TOOLS IT IS HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP LIFT THEM OUT OF POVERTY. DESPITE ITS SIX NOTED SUCCESS HOWEVER THERE CRITICAL POPULATIONS CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND. ONE OF WHICH ARE IMMIGRANTS TO FILE THEIR TAXES USING AND INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. THERE TAXPAYERS THERE ARE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THE SPIKE IN CONTRIBUTING TO OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES THEY CANNOT ACCESS A CRITICAL TOOL TO HELP WORK THEIR WAY OUT OF POVERTY. BUT I'M GRATEFUL THAT THE BUDGET THAT WE WILL VOTE ON TODAY INCLUDES. AN EXPANSION OF THE EYE TO SEE THE FAMILIES OF FILE WITH I TUNES WITH CHILDREN UNDER SIX YEARS OF AGE. IT'S A MAJOR STEP MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT AS I NOTED AT THE BEGINNING. IN THE END THIS IS DEMOCRACY DEMOCRACY OFTENTIMES IS DIFFICULT. TIMES LIKE THESE MAKE OUR DECISIONS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT. BUT IN THE END WE MUST DO WHAT IS BEST FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO DEPEND ON US TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AS DIFFICULT AS IT MAY BE. I DO NOT VOTE TODAY. TAKE HIS RESPONSIBLE PARTY YOUR RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET BUT IN REALITY IT'S ON PRESIDENT RESPONSE TO WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY- WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CHOICES AND I'LL GET TO THAT IN A IN A SECOND BUT THE BASIS OF THIS IS WE ARE FORTUNATE TURN OFF OUR ECONOMY. IN ORDER TO TURN IT BACK ON WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THINGS LIKE PROPERLY FUND OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM EARLY EDUCATION THROUGH OUR CHILD CARE CENTERS ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION A TODAY IS OF COURSE JUNE FIFTEENTH IS THE DEADLINE IN THE CONSTITUTION. TO VOTE ON THE STATE BUDGET BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND MAY NOT BE THE FINAL BUDGET- WE ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING WITH OUR GOVERNOR STILL I KNOW OUR BUDGET SHARES DOING A GREAT JOB ALONG WITH OUR LEADER IN THE SENATE OUR SPEAKER PRO TEM IN OUR BUDGET CHAIR IN THE SENATE. TO COME UP LEAVE IT. MORE PER. FOR MY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STOP THE BLEEDING AND CALIFORNIA- BACK TO WORK- AGAIN THIS BUDGET IS FOCUSEDON MAKING SURE THAT ARE KEY ELEMENTS OF GOVERNMENT ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. SUCH AS OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE DID HAVE TO MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES IN THIS BUDGET WE HAD TO MAKE SOME CUTS FROM. PRIOR INVESTMENTS AND EXPANSIONS OF THINGS LIKE PRESCHOOL FOR ALL. AND TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE EXPANDED LAST YEAR EVEN THE JANUARY BUDGET WE HAD TO PULL BACK TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PROP UP. THE EXISTING PRIORITIES IN THE STATE BUDGET. BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT. IN THIS CALL THE NINETEEN WORLD. OUR SCHOOLS PROBABLY NEED MORE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING. NOT LESS. AND UNFORTUNATELY IN THE MAY REVISE WE SAW HERE SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE BEEN HAVING A 10% COTTON. BASE FUNDING. AND THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT NOT. RELIABLE FOR. SCHOOL FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN WHEN MADE SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE. DECISIONS LAYING OVER THE DAHLE TEACHER IT THE TOPIC THE FIGHT THERE IS. A BIG. I THINK LIKE THE LOWER LOSS OF THE BUDGET BE US TODAY. RIGHT THIS IS THE WE NEED TO. UPPER SCHOOL. MAKE SURE PRESS. SINCE SOME IT. IT'S RIGHT BEHIND THE EVEN MORE BE NOW I WILL KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME CAN ABOUT THE FOR ME I RELATE TO HOW THOSE MONIES GO OUT IN THE LEARNING LOS BLOCK GRANT- WE THINK WE HAVE AN APPROACH THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO IMPACT ALL SCHOOLS AND FOR THEM I KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS IT BRING OPINION WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THAT I MEAN FINANCE. WITH A SOLUTION THERE. THE LADY TO OUR AFTER SCHOOL OR ASUS PROGRAMS AND CHILDCARE PROGRAMS. LET'S FACE IT IN THE BEST OF TIMES THESE PROGRAMS ARE HANGING ON. BY A DEAR THREAD. AND SO HAVING A 10% CUT IN FUNDING FOR OUR CHILD CARE AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE ACES. WOULD BE- THE DEATH OF THESE PROGRAMS NOT ONLY IMPACTS BROWNLEE WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES. AND A LIVELIHOOD OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY THROW A MONKEY WRENCH IN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE TRYING TO GO BACK TO WORK. AND SEE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WHEN THEIR KIDS WHEN THEY GO BACK TO WORK SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE SAY NO TO THESE CATS WITH HIS BUDGET. DOES WE HAVE BEEN TOLD TODAY THAT HIRED CATION MATTERS AS WELL WE KNOW THAT OUR ECONOMY IS BUILT UPON A EDUCATE WORK FOR. OUR OUR BUDGET TRIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP AFLOAT AT LEAST FOR ONE MORE YEAR FUND THE UC AND CSU. AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DO KNOW THAT ALL OF OUR COLLEGES DOING ON EDUCATION BY WILL I. TO WHAT DOWN. L. THANKS IT OUT. ON IS THAT IT THAT'S IT IN THIS. AND LASTLY I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE NOSE THAT WE ARE. STEALING THE FUTURE AND THIS PULLED GIMMICKS CENTRIC. LOOK WE CAN GO. AND GET IN A- FROM THE LOCAL TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. FOR ADOPTING THE AUSTERITY BUDGET GET A TROPHY BUT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS GOING TO THE CHILD CARE CENTERS AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU'RE SHOT DOWN. GO NEAR LOCAL SCHOOL FIFTY THOUSAND PINK SLIPS TO TEACHERS GOING LOCAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. CAN'T STAY AFLOAT SO THESE ARE TOUGH CHOICES IS NOT GONNA MORTGAGE ARE. PART IN OUR GRANDKIDS FOR GENERATIONS WERE REALLY DOING THIS ONE YEAR AT A TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN KEEP THIS STATE UPLOAD. TO TURN BACK ON OUR ECONOMY AGAIN THESE THIS IS ABOUT MAKING TOUGH CHOICES AND I THINK THE RIGHT CHOICES WE HAVE HERE TODAY WITH THAT ASK THE RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY.

THE GOAL FOR MEDI CAL SO PUTS TO SUPPORT THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN EACH OF OUR COMMUNITY. GOES INTO CAL FRESH OR CAL WORKS ALL THE CRITICAL SERVICES. THAT ARE NEEDED.

B. EIGHTY FIVE IS OUR REVENUES TRAILER BILL THE TRAILER BILL INCLUDES TWO MAIN ACTIONS WHICH WOULD GENERATE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE FIRST IS A SUSPENSE NOT OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTIONS FOR CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE NET INCOME. OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO USE THOSE NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTIONS TO REDUCE OUR TAXES AND TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWENTY TWO HOWEVER THEY CAN USE THOSE. DEDUCTIONS FROM THOSE THREE YEARS IN FUTURE YEARS. AND IN GENERAL. A TYPICAL CORPORATION IN ORDER TO GENERATE. A MILLION DOLLARS OF NET. OPERATING LOSSES. WOULD HAVE TO BE MAKING GENERALLY ABOUT FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF GROSS INCOME. IT ALSO LIMITS TAX CREDITS FOR BUSINESSES CAN'T CLAIM MORE THAN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS PER YEAR OF TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND SO THESE TAX CREDITS WHICH REDUCE THE BUSINESSES TAX. BILL DIRECTLY ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS THE LARGEST BUSINESS TAX CREDIT IN THIS CATEGORY IS RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT TAX GROW. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY AYE VOTE ON A. B. EIGHTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHANG MISTER OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION AB FIVE COLLEAGUES THIS TRAILER BILL WILL INCREASE. TAXES ON CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS BY OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND IT DOES SO IN A PARTICULARLY PERNICIOUS AN UNFAIR WAY. ONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT CAPS- TAX CREDITS TO A MAXIMUM OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IN CALIFORNIA. SO LET ME EXPLAIN. WHAT THAT WOULD BE AN A METAPHOR. THAT RELATES TO A TRANSACTION THAT YOU ARE I MIGHT UNDERTAKE IF YOU'RE BUYING A PHONE IN YOUR CONSIDERING. ARE A LESS EXPENSIVE PHONE IN A MORE EXPENSIVE PHONE AND YOU SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA BUY THE MORE EXPENSIVE PHONE BECAUSE THERE'S A REBATE THAT THE MANUFACTURER IS OFFERING YOU COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY. AND THEN LATER THE MANUFACTURE TELLS YOU YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'VE RESCINDED THAT REBATE WE'RE SORRY WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEND YOU THAT MONEY BUT YOU CAN APPLY FOR IN A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. TO CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS CONSIDER THE CASE OF A MOVIE STUDIO WHO'S MADE THE DECISION TO FILM IN CALIFORNIA. EVEN THOUGH COSTS ARE HIGHER HERE AND SAY THAT THEY FILLED A MOVIE OR A TELEVISION COMMERCIAL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN. WE ARE RETROACTIVELY TELLING THEM THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR THE MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT. COLLEAGUES THAT IS UNFAIR THEY RELATE RELIED ON THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA TAX ALL IN GOOD FAITH AND THEY DESERVE OUR GOOD FAITH. ANOTHER REALLY TROUBLING ASPECT OF THIS TRAILER BILL IS THE SUSPENSION OF THE NET OPERATING LOSS TAX DEDUCTION. THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE TAX DEDUCTION THAT IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. TO EVEN OUT THERE REVENUES IF THEY HAVE A BAD YEAR IN A GOOD YEAR. COMMON SENSE IS THAT YOU'D EVER THOSE TOGETHER FOR THE PURPOSES OF TAXATION. BUT WE ARE RETROACTIVELY TELLING CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES THAT THEY CAN'T DO THAT AND WE'RE DOING IT IN A YEAR. WHEN THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS SHUT DOWN A LARGER SWATH OF OUR CALIFORNIA STATE ECONOMY. SO THESE BUSINESSES ARE HAVING TO PUT AN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THIS YEAR JUST TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A NET OPERATING LOSS THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE ACTIONS OF THE STATE. AND WE'RE TELLING THEM THROUGH THIS ACTION. THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO CLAIM THAT LOSS ON THEIR TAXES NEXT YEAR. THAT IS NOT ONLY UNFAIR IT IS ON JUST I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER O'NEILL TO MISTER MELLING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS WE ENTER THIS BUDGET CYCLE WITH MANY UNKNOWNS THE ACTUAL DEATH AND LENGTH OF THE RECESSION. YET TO BE DETERMINED. THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR CALIFORNIA YET TO BE DETERMINED. AND THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF A MAJOR REVISION OF THE CORPORATE SIDE OF PROP THIRTEEN ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. WHICH IS MAJOR BUDGET IMPLICATIONS ALSO YET TO BE DETERMINED. SO I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND. WHY WE ARE BEING ASKED TO MAKE A THREE YEAR FISCAL DECISION AND POLICY RD TAX CREDIT THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. MY DISTRICT IS THE BIRTHPLACE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. HERE'S WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THESE COMPANIES MANY ARE WORKING ON TREATMENTS FOR TOBIN. AND OTHER LIFE THREATENING DISEASES AND THESE COMPANIES WILL BE CRUCIAL TO DRIVING ANY ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN OUR STATE. SO WHAT A TIME WHEN TOBIN CONTINUES TO THREATEN US AND CLEARLY WILL HAVE A NEED FOR THE LIFE SCIENCES SECTOR TO BE AN ECONOMIC ENGINE AND JOB- GOING FORWARD GENERATING REVENUES TO BOLSTER OUR STATE BUDGET IN FUTURE BUDGET YEARS. WHERE WE CONTEMPLATING A THREE YEAR PAUSE I WILL SUPPORT THIS TRAILER TODAY BECAUSE WE NEED TO SHOW THE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR. TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET AND FIND CRUCIAL PROGRAMS HOWEVER I STRONGLY URGE OUR LEADERSHIP AND THE GOVERNOR. VERY QUICKLY REVISIT THIS ISSUE ONCE WE KNOW THE ACTUAL REVENUE PICTURE FOR TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY AFTER THE JULY FIFTEEN TAX DEADLINE AND AFTER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOPEFULLY TAKES ACTION ON ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. AND OR STIMULUS SO WE HAVE A TRUE FEEL FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE BEFORE US. IN ANY STATE LEVEL ECONOMIC RECOVERY OR STIMULUS CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN THIS SUMMER. MUST INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THESE TAX POLICIES. TO ENSURE WE ARE NOT SACRIFICING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS AS WE TRY TO STIMULATE JOB CREATION AND RECOVERY. WILL ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TO ADDRESS THE MEDIA FISCAL CONCERN I MOST CERTAINLY URGE MORE CAPRI CONVERSATION. ONE THAT INCLUDES THE RAPID RESTORATION OF THE UTILIZATION OF THIS CREDIT SHOULD THE CONDITIONS WARRANT. ASPEN I'VE- THANK YOU MISTER MILLER MISTER FLORA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL AND LARGELY. COUPLE MEMBERS OF BROUGHT UP IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE ALREADY HAD TAXATION. ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS WOULD COME THROUGH THE CODE AND THEN RECESSION AND IS FOLLOWED THAT. WE ASK OUR LIFE SCIENCE INDUSTRY TO CREATE A CURE TO HELP US WORK THROUGH THAT. BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY TAX THE VERY PEOPLE WE'VE TASK. WITH HELPING US FIX THIS ISSUE. AND IT'S FASCINATING TO ME THAT WE ARE HERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE. LIFE SCIENCE INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION OF OUR CONSTITUENTS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DIRECTLY- AT WITH LIFE SCIENCES AND IN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS. WORK IN THE ARE IN THE SECTION OF THE LIFE SIZE COMMUNITY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIFE SCIENCE IN OUR INDIE. THIS IS NOT A BIG MANUFACTURING WAREHOUSE. THESE ARE TYPICALLY SMALLER INSTITUTIONS. IF YOU GO TO MASSACHUSETTS THEY ARE SALIVATING. FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES TO LEAVE OUR STATE THEY'RE OPENING THE DOORS FOR COMPANIES TO MOVE TO THEIR STATE AND WE'RE GOING TO DOUBLE DOWN ON TAXING THEM THE VERY PEOPLE. OUR ASKING THE WERE POURING THEM TO HELP US FIX KOBE NINETEEN TO DEVELOP A VACCINE IN A CURE WELL GUESS WHAT THANK YOU HERE'S INITIAL TAX BURDEN I REQUEST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN OVER. THEY GIVE US FLORA. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE BILL. MR TANG YOU MAY CLOSE. SPEAKER I UNDERSTAND WITH MY COLLEAGUES VOTING FOR REVENUES IS NEVER VERY EASY. BUT THESE ARE THE CHOICES THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE IN THESE VERY TOUGH TIMES. WE DON'T GENERATE THE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. THEN IT'S A TWO BILLION DOLLAR HIT FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. AND IF WE DON'T EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN. THERE WON'T BE ANY FORTY TWO. FLOYD AT THESE LIFE SCIENCES COMPANIES TO BE EMPLOYED THE TECHNOLOGY. THE OTHER TWO BILLION DOLLARS WOULD COME AT THE EXPENSE OF MANY OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS SYSTEMS THAT WERE THE BIRTH. OF THE FLY FOR THE COMPANY WHAT THE UNIVERSITY I REPRESENT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS WHERE GENENTECH FOR START. SO AGAIN THESE BUDGETS THIS BUDGET IS A VERY. TOUGH CHOICES WE HAD TO MAKE. UNPOPULAR DECISIONS. WE HAD TO MAKE VERY TOUGH CHOICES. AND WE TRIED TO DO WAS TO ENSURE. THAT OUR INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION. OR INVESTMENTS IN HEALTHCARE. OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE SERVICES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES NEED FOR EVERYDAY LIFE. WILL CONTINUE TO BE MET.

THAT MEASURE PASSES WE'VE DISPENSED WITH FILE ITEM SIXTY FOUR THIS IS FILE ITEM. SIXTY FIVE. AB THIRTY FIFTY SIX. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY FIFTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ AND OTHERS AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT MISS HIS HOUSE YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AB THIRTY FIFTY SIX WOULD CREATE WORKPLACE SAFETY AND FAIR PAY STANDARD FOR WORKERS WHO OPERATE UNDER A QUOTA WHILE WORKING IN A WAREHOUSE. IN MODERN WAREHOUSES COMPANY SET SPECIFIC QUOTAS FOR WORKERS TO MEET MONITOR PRODUCTIVITY INCLUDING HOW MUCH TIME OFF TASK OCCURS IF THEY CAN'T MEET THAT QUOTA THREE TIMES THEY'RE OFTEN FIRED. IN EVEN WHEN THEY NEED TO WASH THEIR HANDS DURING THIS PANDEMIC OR TAKE A BREAK TO WALK TO THE RESTROOM. THOSE MINUTES ARE COUNTED AGAINST THEM AND IF YOU LOOK AT ONE FACILITY IN PARTICULAR AND RIVERSIDE IT TAKES A WORKER SEVEN MINUTES TO WALK TO THE BATHROOM. USE THE BATHROOM OF COURSE AND WALK BACK SO ALL OF THOSE MEN SIR ACTUALLY COUNTED AGAINST HER QUOTA. OUR BILL DOESN'T TOUCH THE QUOTA IT ALLOWS THE EMPLOYER TO CONTINUE TO DECIDE WHAT THE QUOTA SHOULD BE BUT TO TELL THEM HAT YOU CAN'T COUNT AGAINST A WORKER IF THEY HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM OR WASH YOUR HANDS. OR TAKE A PICTURE OF A LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS. THOSE THREE THINGS IT ALSO TELLS WAREHOUSES THAT IF YOU UP THAT QUOTA AND THAT'S WHAT AT OPTIONALLY HAPPENS. WHEN THEY GET BUSIER AND BUSIER THEY DON'T OFFER THEIR EMPLOYEES OVER TIME. THEY JUST SAY YOU TO GET THE WORK DONE FASTER SO WE SAY IF YOU UP YOUR REGULAR QUOTA YOU HAVE TO PAY PREMIUM TAP TIME THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD. IF YOU WERE DOING OVERTIME. THIS IS A- COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO A WORK PRODUCT THAT WE'RE NOT USED TO. IT'S MORE IT'S- MORE FAMILIAR ARE IT SEEMS MORE LIKE PIECE WORK IN OUR FIELD THAN IT DOES. A NORMAL HOURLY JOB. FOR THAT REASON WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A STANDARD THAT'S HUMANE. THAT LOOKS OUT FOR WORKERS IN ALLOWS THEM TO AT LEAST FUNCTION LIKE NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS. THEY WANT TO WASH THEIR HANDS IN A PANDEMIC. WHERE THAT MIGHT BE ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR HEALTH AND WE KNOW THESE OUTBREAKS SIR THROUGHOUT THESE WAREHOUSES. WE NEED TO USE THE RESTROOM. I THINK THAT THAT'S A COMMON DECENCY WHICH ALLOW ALL WORKERS WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISS. MISS GONZALES MISTER MEDINA AND- THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THEY YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY FIFTY SIX. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. IN MY DISTRICT. WHERE WE HAVE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF WAREHOUSES. WAREHOUSE WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL IN OUR CURRENT SOCIETY BUT FACED BACKBREAKING WORKPLACE CONDITIONS. AND EXPECTATIONS. WAREHOUSE WORKERS CURRENTLY SUFFERED INJURIES AND NEARLY TWICE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE DUE TO STRENUOUS AND TAXING WORKING CONDITIONS. WE ALSO WORK LONGER SHIFTS DURING PEAK SEASONS SUCH AS HOLIDAYS FOR THE CURRENT PANDEMIC WHICH SHIPS MAY BE EXTENDED TO LAST BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE HOURS PER DAY. AND FEAR BEING FIRED WAS STILL KEEPING DISTRICT QUOTAS. MESSAGES SENT TO AMAZON WORKERS DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HAVE ASKED THEM TO QUOTE UNQUOTE MANDATORY WORK MANDATORY EXTRA TIME. OR FACE SEPARATION OF EMPLOYMENT. IT'S CLEAR THAT WAREHOUSE WORKERS NEED ADDITIONAL WORKPLACE SAFETY AT PACE STANDARDS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIRTY FIFTY SIX. THANK THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA MR FONG IN THE REAR CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THERE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH THIS BILL AB THIRTY FIFTY SIX IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHY MANY BELIEVE SACRAMENTO IS HAVING- IS HARMING OUR STATE'S BUSINESS CLIMATE. AN AMAZON FACILITY WILL BE COMING TO MY DISTRICT THIS SUMMER AND THAT IS SOMETHING TO BE CELEBRATED OUR COMMUNITY I JUST OPENS THAT MUCH NEEDED WORK OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS AND PROVIDES REVENUE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES IS EMPLOYERS ABILITY TO HIRE MORE WORKERS BY ALLOWING THE OFTEN ABUSING FOR LET'S TALK A LAWSUIT TO BLEED DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. WE HAVE HEARD STORY AFTER STORY HOW FRIVOLOUS PAGA LAWSUITS BY ATTORNEYS ARE PREVENTING- OR ARE WELL THEY'RE WELL DOCUMENTED AND WE KNOW THAT THESE OF THESE LAWSUITS DO NOT PROVIDE EMPLOYEES REAL PROTECTIONS OR BENEFITS. AB THIRTY FIFTY SIX IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT BURDENS THAT PUNISHES COMPANIES THEY'RE SEEING SELECT REASONS YOU BUSINESS IN OUR STATE FOR THESE REASONS I ASKED. FOR KNOW ABOUT. DEAN NO OTHER MAY SEEKING. RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM MS GONZALEZ YOU MAKE LAW. I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR AND THING THERE ARE NO MOM AND POP MASSIVE WAREHOUSES. I'M AS PRIMARILY IS ONE COMPANY I'LL BE HONEST. BUT ALSO PART DOES NOT US I KNOW IT'S OFTEN BROUGHT UP BUT I WISH PEOPLE WOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND IT THIS IS A SECTION OF HARDER THAT'S NOT AUTOMATIC IT ALLOWS A THIRTY DAY PERIOD TO CURE OF VIOLATION THAT MEANS EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO STILL AND WANTED TO LITIGATE ON IT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TELL- THE EMPLOYER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO IN THE PLAYER HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING WRONG. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS ISN'T AN AUTOMATIC LAWSUIT IT ALLOWS THE EMPLOYER THE ABILITY TO GET IT RIGHT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT AMAZON HAS THE ABILITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE THE REST AND. EVERY LAST VOTE. WITH THAT CLARK OF THE ROLE. DESERVE ON MEMBERS OF ARE VOTE. ALL MEMBERS. IT IS ERA. BUT. WE CLARK WELL. CLOSE ROLL TIDE ABOUT AYE AYES FORTY EIGHT NO SEVENTEEN THAT MEASURE PASSES. THIS IS FILE ITEM SIXTY SIX AB. THIRTY SEVENTY FIVE. KERKORIAN ASSEMBLY RULE THIRTY SEVENTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ AND OTHERS AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT THIS IS ALSO MAKE AN OPEN. THIS BILL IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY IF WELL. FORTUNATELY THE LAWS ARE THE LIES IF YOUR WORKER IN YOU STEAL FROM YOUR EMPLOYER YOU'RE GONNA GO TO JAIL. YOU'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO LOSE YOUR JOB BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO JAIL UNFORTUNATELY UNDER THE LAW IF YOUR EMPLOYER AND YOU STEAL THE WAGES OF YOUR WORKER YOU DON'T GO TO JAIL. AND IN FACT EVEN IF THERE IS A FINAL WAGE CLAIM AGAINST YOU A FINAL ADJUDICATED CLAIM THAT SAYS YOU STOLE FROM YOUR WORKERS YOU CAN SIMPLY SHUT DOWN YOUR BUSINESS. AND START AGAIN AND START A NEW BUSINESS AND NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IN IT HAPPENS WELL OVER A MAJORITY OF THE TIME CASES FILED. THROUGH THIS DAMAGE WHAT WE FOUND ALREADY IS COMPANIES WHO SHUT DOWN DURING PANDEMIC DID NOT HATE FINAL PAYCHECK TO THE WORKERS THAT'S TWO WEEKS AT LEAST OF LOST TIME WATCH. STOLEN FROM EACH ONE THE WORKERS AND THERE ARE RED STARTING TO STAR A NEW. DURING THE GAME. I WANTED TO DO A BILL TO BE THESE AND- ENJOY. HONESTLY BUT GIVEN HOW WE DON'T DO NEW CRIMES. INSTEAD WE SIMPLY WANT PEOPLE TO SAY IT YOU CAN NOT YOU HAVE TO A TEST THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A FINAL WAIT ORDER CLAIM AGAINST YOU WHEN YOU TRY TO START A NEW BUSINESS. THE CHAMBER WAS OPPOSE BECAUSE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE ABOUT THE FINAL ADJUDICATION AND ABOUT ALLOWING LOCAL CITIES TO OUR AS ARTY LOUD UNDER LAW TO PURSUE STATE WAGE CLAIMS. WE'VE TAKEN THEIR AMENDMENTS. THEY WANT A FEW MORE COMMAS IN AN INWARD CHANGES WE'VE AGREED TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE. BUT IN ORDER TO STRIKE SOME BALANCE IN ENSURE THAT. THE FEEL BAD EMPLOYERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HURTING BLACK AND BROWN WORKERS THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF STEALING THEIR LABOR THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO JUST.

CITIES AND COUNTIES WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR HOMELESS SERVICES AND RENT ASSISTANCE ARE IN DIRE NEED OF HELP. COVERT NINETEEN IS PRESENTED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE ON DAUNTING TASK.

KIRK WELL CLOSE REAL TIDE BUT I SIXTY NINE NO ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS FROM WAY BACK IN THE FILE THE FILE ITEM SEVENTY TWO. AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE FIVE MINUTES LONG. CORPORATION ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE A ONE BY SOME MEMORABLY MONNING ACKLEY NICOLE BUT NOT LEAVE VISIBLE. THANK YOU SPEAKER TODAY I BRING BEFORE YOU TWENTY FIVE OH ONE TO ADDRESS THE VERY DIFFICULT FINANCIAL SITUATIONS THAT MANY CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING. THESE FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING NOT DUE TO ANY FAULT OF THEIR OWN BUT DUE TO THE SPREAD OF A DANGEROUS VIRUS AND DUE TO THE NEEDED RESPONSE THAT WE HAVE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. COLLECTIVELY WE HAVE MADE DECISIONS DECISIONS THAT WE UNDERSTAND ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS BY IMPLEMENTING STAY AT HOME ORDERS AND RESTRICTING A BROAD RANGE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THESE RISKS SINCE HAVE SUCCEEDED REDUCING THE TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS BUT THEY ALSO CREATE VERY DIFFICULT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THE LAST RECESSION. LIVING EXPENSES INCREASE MUCH FASTER AND WAGES AND CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS ENTERED THIS PANDEMIC WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF DEBT THAN WE HAVE EVER SEEN. FOR FAMILIES WHO BARELY WHO ARE BARELY GETTING BY AND WERE BARELY GETTING BY THE FOR THE CRISIS. THEY'RE HAVING TO COPE pWITH THIS TEMPORARY REALITY UNTIL WE CONTAIN THE VIRUS AND WE CAN SAFELY RETURN TO NORMAL ACTIVITIES. AS THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW TO PREPARE FOR THE MONTHS AHEAD. EPIDEMIOLOGIST IN PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS WARN IS THAT THE SECOND WAVE MAY COME LATER THIS YEAR AND MAY REQUIRE ANOTHER ROUND OF STAY AT HOME ORDERS AND ECONOMIC RESTRICTIONS. THE WRITING IS ON THE WALL CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING NOW AND EVEN MORE MAYBE STRUGGLING SIX MONTHS FROM NOW. AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE SIX TO PROVIDE THESE FAMILIES WITH TIME TO WEATHER THE STORM. THE BILL DOES NOT FOR GAVE OR CANCEL ANY DAY. INSTEAD IT REQUIES LENDERS TO OFFER FORBEARANCE OR A TEMPORARY DELAY IN MAKING PAYMENTS ON MORTGAGES CAR LOANS AND SMALL DOLLAR LOANS. AS WE EVENTUALLY LEARN HOW TO CONTAIN THE VIRUS THE BILL PROVIDES A PATHWAY BACK FOR CONSUMERS TO RESUME MAKING THEIR LOAN PAYMENTS. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE. DO WE TRUST EVERY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ALWAYS DO WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHEN WE DID THAT LAST HOW DID IT WORK OUT FOR US WHEN THEY AWARDED THE PPP FUNDING. OR DO WE ESTABLISH THE SAFETY NET THAT PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO FOR CLOSURES AND REPOSSESSIONS I COULD BE PREVENTABLE. THE FIRST APPROACH IS BASED ON TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS THE IDEA THAT IF WE MAKE SURE BUSINESSES ARE HEALTHY THEN THE BENEFITS WILL TRICKLE DOWN TO WORKERS AND CONSUMERS. THE OTHER APPROACH IS BASED FROM A BOTTOMS UP PERSPECTIVE HOW CAN WE PRO ACTIVELY HELP EVERY DAY PEOPLE SO THAT THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND WELL BEING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BROADER ECONOMY. I BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD PRIMARILY TO HELP FAMILIES. BUT THIS BILL IS ALSO ABOUT SETTING CALIFORNIA UP FOR AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. CONSUMER SPENDING MAKES IT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF OUR ECONOMIES GDP. WITHOUT A HEALTHY CONSUMER THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ECONOMIC RECOVERY. USING FINANCIAL TOOLS LIKE FOR PARENTS CAN OF AVOID UNNECESSARY FOR CLOSURES EVOKE SHINS DISPLACEMENT AND REPOSSESSIONS THAT WILL HARM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS TO DATE AND SLOW DOWN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR THE FUTURE. BEFORE I WRAP UP MY OPENING REMARKS I WANT TO ADDRESS THE MYTH THAT HAVE BEEN FLOATING OUT THERE. THE MYTH BE SPREAD AROUND IS THAT THE IDEA THAT FORBEARANCE IS OFFERED. THAT A FLOOD OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT NEED IT WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT ANYWAY. WE HAVE EVIDENCE FROM THIS EMERGENCY THAT THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. IN LATE MARCH CONGRESS PASSED THE CARES ACT WHICH PROVIDES MORTGAGE FOR PERRANCE UP TO ONE YEAR FOR FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES. THE CARES ACT PROHIBITS A MORTGAGE SERVICER FROM REQUIRING ANY DOCUMENTATION FROM A BORROWED TO PROVIDE THEIR FINANCIAL HARDSHIP SO WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT MANY PEOPLE. WOULD HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS RIGHT. ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE THE MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION PUBLISHES DATA WEEKLY ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF MORTGAGES MORTGAGES AND FORBEARANCE THIS WEEK'S REPORT SHOWS THAT ONLY EIGHT POINT 5% OF MORTGAGES ARE IN FORBEARANCE. SO WE HAVE THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 16% WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE OPERATING AT REDUCED CAPACITY IF AT ALL. BUT THE FORBEARANCE RATE REMAINS IN THE SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGES THIRTY TELL US. IT TELLS ME THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOMEOWNERS ARE STILL PAYING FOR THEIR MORTGAGE WHO CAN AFFORD IT EVEN THOSE HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INCOME GO DOWN ARE TIGHTENING THEIR BUDGETS. WE MUST ACT TODAY FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND. FOR EIGHTEEN BACK AND WAITING FOR CLOSURES REPOSSESSIONS AND PERMANENT DAMAGE TO CREDIT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR AN ECONOMY TO RECOVER. THANK YOU. THANK HIM AS A MOM IS BOERNER HORVATH THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO VOTE I WON AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE AND I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN THIS BILL I DON'T LIKE AND I'VE TALKED TO THE AUTHOR AT LENGTH ABOUT THE THINGS I LIKE AND WHAT I DON'T LIKE AND THE AUTHOR HAS PROMISED TO WORK WITH US TO GET TO A PLACE THAT PROTECTS. CONSUMERS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY DEFAULT YOUR BECAUSE THEY CANNOT WORK. IN A PROTECT THEIR CREDIT SO THAT WHEN WE ARE FACING A CONSUMER GOODS RECESSION IN A YEAR OR SO THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN BUY. AND THAT IS THE POWER OF THIS BILL IS WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS FROM DEFAULTS BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN. AND I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR ROLE OF GOVERNMENT AND WE LOOK AT HOW DO WE LEAVE THIS IS THE BILL THAT LEAVES. NOW I DON'T LIKE EVERYTHING THE BILL BUT I TRUSTS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SANTA BARBARA. WHO KNOWS THIS IS OUR BAKING SURE TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE REACH THE RIGHT BALANCE AND JUST LIKE ALL OF US HAVE THE RIGHT WHEN IT BACKING FOR PRINCE OF WE'RE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT WE SEE. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE NO WHEN IT COMES BACK. ALL I THINK HE'S DOING IMPORTANT BILL AND THE RIGHT SPACE. CHECKED OUR CONSUMERS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE I TODAY. MR FRAZIER YOUR RESIDENTS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER WELL I APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THIS BILL CONTINUES TO HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AB TWENTY FIVE OH ONE IS AIMED AT ASSISTING PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FINANCIALLY IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN. THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE HELP TO THOSE WHO NEED IT TO SURVIVE AND MUST RELY ON FOR PARENTS. HOWEVER THERE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HIGHER WE PATROL CREDIT UNION WHO ARE NOT FINANCIALLY IMPACT BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSE CHARTER AND GETTING UNFAIRLY AFFECTED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. I ASKED THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE AND WILL NOT OF THE HEAD I WILL GIVE A COURTESY VOTE TODAY. LOOKING FORWARD TO UGH. A GOOD OUTCOME WITH THE CREDIT. THEY DO GOOD WORK FOR THEIR MEMBERS AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A RESOLUTION THAT WILL MAKE HER HAPPY AND THE ASSOCIATION HAPPY FOR THAT. I THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE TODAY BUT RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE MY VOTE IF. IT'S NOT A HAPPY ENDING. DOCTOR WOULD THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO ASK THAT YOU VOTE I ON THIS BILL. THIS IS THE ONLY BILL OF ITS KIND IN EITHER HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW. THIS ISN'T A BILL THAT THE AUTHOR DECIDED SHE WANTED TO CARRY IN JANUARY. IS A BILL IN RESPONSE TO A CRISIS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS AT THE END OF THE YEAR. WE ADJOURN ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST AND WE DON'T COME BACK SOME OF US DON'T ARE COMING BACK AT ALL BUT WE DON'T RECONVENE UNTIL JANUARY. FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD CHANGE DRAMATICALLY WE HAVE FIVE MILLION PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA. MANY SO MANY IN CALIFORNIA RELY ON CARS TO GET AROUND. ARE THE ENHANCE- UNEMPLOYMENT WILL END AT THE END OF JULY. MANY PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY HANGING ON IT WOULD BE REALLY. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND SAY I DIDN'T LIFT A FINGER TO TRY TO PROTECT YOU. BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE SOME GUIDELINES HERE. NOT EVERY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IS CREATED EQUAL THERE'S A REALLY FINE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN MY DISTRICT THAT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR THEY WORK REALLY WELL WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS BUT THEY- IF THAT WAS THE CASE OF ALL OF THEM THEN WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. IF PEOPLE IF THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND HANDLE PP LOANS EQUITABLY FOR EVERYBODY WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS. DURING THE LAST FINANCIAL MELTDOWN. THESE BIG INSTITUTIONS THESE HUGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WENT TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR A HAND OUT FOR A BAIL OUT. AND THEY GOT IT. WELL GUESS WHAT WE AS CONSUMERS MIGHT NEED THAT BAIL OUT THIS TIME. THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE HEALTHY. THEY'RE HEALTHY AND WE MIGHT NEED THEIR HELP AND WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. SO VOTE TODAY IS KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING. AND A VOTE TODAY IT'S A TRICK POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR SOME GUIDELINES IN THE FUTURE SO WE CAN PROTECT CONSUMERS WHO CAN HELP PEOPLE KEEP THEIR CART CARS TO HELP PEOPLE KEEP THEIR HOMES. AND THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE ARE GOING TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT A LITTLE BIT LATER. I THINK THAT'S AN OKAY COMPROMISE HERE. I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME TODAY IN VOTING FOR THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR OF. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. MS LOW MOAN YOU MAY CLOSE WE WISH. THANK YOU MEMBERS I ASKED US ALL TO FAST FORWARD ONE YEAR RIGHT CONNIE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE BECAUSE EVERY TIME THE DISEASE FLARES UP WE ARE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STRONG PHYSICAL DISTANCE IN ORDERS. UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS STUBBORNLY HIGH FAR HIGHER THAN DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. WE MAY PERHAPS HIT PROJECTIONS LIKE THE LA TIMES SAID OF INCREASING OUR HOMELESS POPULATION UP 2405% IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HUNDREDS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE CALLING TO TELL YOU THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF DEFAULT. AND THAT THEIR SERVICE PLANS TO FOR CLOSURE ON THEIR HOME. TO TELL YOU THAT THEIR CAR WAS REPOSSESSED OR TO TELL YOU THAT THEY HAVE FALLING BEHIND ON OTHER DEBT. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY TO THEM. WILL WE BE WILLING TO ADMIT THAT WE PUT OUR FAITH THAT THINGS WERE JUST GOING TO WORK OUT FOR THEM. WILL WE BE WILLING TO ADMIT. THAT WE WERE NOT WILLING TO CONSIDER PROPOSALS TO HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS STAY IN THEIR HOME AND STABILIZER FINANCIAL SITUATIONS. THIS BILL ENVISIONS THE DIFFICULT TIMES THAT CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE FACING NOT ONLY THE CHALLENGES OF TODAY BUT ALSO LOOKING MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD. UNEMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS ARE SET TO EXPIRE THIS JULY WHAT HAPPENS IN AUGUST. IT IS THE HOPE THAT THE ECONOMY REBOUNDS WE ALL WISH THAT WE ALL HOPE. AND THAT VERY FEW FAMILIES WILL FACE THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS THAT REQUIRE THEM TO RELY ON THESE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED BY THE BILL. BUT WE NEED TO FACE THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT THE WORLD MAY NOT WORK OUT THAT WAY. I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORKING ON THIS BILL WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. THESE ARE NOT EASY CONVERSATIONS THEY ARE NOT EASY PROBLEMS THERE ARE NO EASY PROBLEMS UNDER COVERT AND A COLLAPSING ECONOMY. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL SO THAT THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION CAN CONTINUE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WITH THAT PURPLE OF RURAL. FOLK. DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS ARE RESERVE VOTE.
