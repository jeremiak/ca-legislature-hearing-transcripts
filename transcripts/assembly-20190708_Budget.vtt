HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE WORDING

00:23:59.037 --> 00:24:00.739
OF THE BILL BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND

00:24:00.806 --> 00:24:02.741
THAT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH WE

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:03.608
ARE PASSING OUT.

00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:05.677
BUT THE BILL AS IT'S ACTUALLY

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:07.279
WRITTEN IS VERY VAGUE MERELY

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:09.815

THAT'S ALL BUT IF YOU LOOK AT AB

00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:19.224
TEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH YOU

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.259
OBVIOUSLY IS THE COMPARE THE

00:24:21.326 --> 00:24:23.495
COMPANION LEGISLATION. EIGHT TEN

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:24.095
FIFTY FOUR IS VERY SPECIFIC

00:24:24.162 --> 00:24:25.297
ABOUT HOW THAT MONEY IS SUPPOSED

00:24:25.363 --> 00:24:26.464
TO BE SPENT BY THE DEAL OF SO

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:28.433
WHY WAS IT NECESSARY TO BE SO

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.634
VAGUE AND SB ONE TIME.

00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:30.735

REALIZES THERE ARE NUMBER OF

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.172

THE ADMINISTRATION IS NIMBLE AND

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:41.446

RESPONSIBILITIES SPECIFIC TO THE

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:50.522
DIRECTOR OF FINANCE THE

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:51.790

WILDFIRE FIND.

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.193
IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THE

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.095
WILDFIRE ALLOCATION METRICS ARE

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.363

CASH CUSHION.

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:08.173
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THIS IS

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.040
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE IS

00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:11.209

OF THE SCALE OF WHAT.

00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:14.646
THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:16.481
ACCOMPLISH SO WE WANTED TO MAKE

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:18.483
SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.118
THAT FLEXIBILITY TO SPEND IT IN

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.419
DIFFERENT WAYS AND OF COURSE.

MONEY THAT IS SPENT UPON

00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:26.892

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:29.694
NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:34.900

THANK YOU THANK YOU.

00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:38.637
THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:39.471
SAYING THAT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT

00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:43.875
ON THE ON THE BILL.

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:45.443
OKAY SINGLE PUBLIC ON A WE'RE

AS MENTIONED THIS IS A TRAILER

00:25:52.784 --> 00:25:54.586
BILL FOR THE BUDGET -- AND AS

00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.221
THE VICE CHAIR WAS MENTIONING A

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:57.722
LOT OF THE KEY POLICY CHANGES

00:25:57.789 --> 00:26:01.426
ARE ACTUALLY AND AB OR SB TEN

00:26:01.493 --> 00:26:02.427
THE ENERGY COMMITTEE.

00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:03.762
SO WITH THE REASON THAT WE

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:05.230
REQUIRED THIS BILL IN ADDITION

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:06.798
TO THAT IS FOR TWO REASONS

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:08.433
NUMBER -- ONE SOME OF THE

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.901
CHANGES AS PART OF THIS OVERALL

00:26:09.968 --> 00:26:12.003
STRATEGY REQUIRE REORGANIZATION

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.838
AND A BUDGET TRAILER BILL AS A

00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:15.440
MORE APPROPRIATE MEASURE A

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:16.574
VEHICLE FOR THOSE TYPES OF

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.310

00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:20.578
CHANGES.

00:26:20.645 --> 00:26:22.480
IN THIS BILL AND THEN THE SECOND

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:24.816
REASON IS THAT THE RESOURCES FOR

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:26.318
THAT PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:28.219

00:26:29.321 --> 00:26:30.722
BUDGET PROCESS AND DID GO

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:31.923
THROUGH THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.757
I IN THE IN THE CONFERENCE

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:34.459

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:43.668
TRAILER BILL AND WITH THAT I'LL

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:44.402
