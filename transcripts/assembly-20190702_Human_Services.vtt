CREATING A LONG TERM SERVICES

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:08.620
AND SUPPORTS OUR L. TSS BENEFIT

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:09.554
FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:10.722
THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:12.357
THIS THE BENEFIT IS URGENT

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:14.225
ALMOST EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE WHO

00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:15.260
ARE EITHER OLDER ADULTS ARE

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:16.494
INDIVIDUALS WITH PHYSICAL MENTAL

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:18.063
DISABILITIES CURRENTLY LIVE IN

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:19.097
CALIFORNIA.

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:21.166
AND THIS POPULATION WILL GROW

00:28:21.232 --> 00:28:21.766
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:23.601
DECADE BUT UNFORTUNATELY MANY

00:28:23.668 --> 00:28:25.403
CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.972
AFFORDABLE L. TSS SERVICES.

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:29.040
WHAT TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:30.475
ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.177
MEDICARE AND MOST CALIFORNIANS

00:28:32.243 --> 00:28:33.211
CANNOT AFFORD TO PURCHASE

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:35.246
PRIVATE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:36.381
AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT THAT

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:38.450
MARKET ALSO?

00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:39.384
IS QUITE TROUBLED.

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:41.486
PAYING FOR OUT OUT OF POCKET FOR

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.588
L. TSS IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND

00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:44.823
CREATES A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL

00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:46.891
SOCIAL BURDEN.

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:48.426
SO WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE WHILE

00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:50.395
CALIFORNIANS MUST SPEND DOWN

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:51.996
THROUGH LIFE SAVINGS TO BECOME

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.498
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW.

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.300
AND TOO OFTEN THIS IS THE

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:56.367
PRIMARY MEANS BY WHICH OLDER

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:57.702
ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:58.803
DISABILITIES CURRENTLY RECEIVE

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.572
ACCESS TO PAY LONG TERM SUPPORT

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:01.906
SERVICES.

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:03.408
MEDI CAL IS A CRITICAL SAFETY

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:04.709
NET BUT THE SYSTEM IS

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:06.611
OVERBURDENED AS WE KNOW AS WE GO

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:08.146
THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS.

00:29:08.213 --> 00:29:09.481
INDIVIDUALS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:11.282

OUR CHILDREN'S INHERITANCE OR TO

00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:15.186
FOREGO WORKING WHICH IS THE

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.821
OTHER THING THAT HAPPENS IS THAT --

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:18.723
YOU NEED THE SERVICES AND IF YOU

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.691

00:29:19.757 --> 00:29:21.092
MUCH MONEY AND THAT YOU CAN'T

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:22.494
AFFORD YOUR CERTAIN SERVICES SO

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.394

UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE

00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:16.821
REALITY FOR MANY.

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:23.361
THE COST OF CARE IS A LITTLE

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:23.928
OVER NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:25.029

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.637
NOT EVEN COVER HALF THE CARE.

00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:34.238
AS AN ONLY CHILD DAVID FEELS

FUNDING FOR THE BILL ITSELF IS

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:10.921
ACTUALLY A PART OF THE THE

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:12.957
BUDGET THAT IS NOW BEEN ENACTED

00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:13.324

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:18.762
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ACTUALLY.

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:20.230
DOES VERY QUESTIONS THAT YOU

WITH DISABILITIES AND THAT -- WE

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:42.820
THE ONLY INFRASTRUCTURE READ WE

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.288
HAVE RIGHT NOW IS ESSENTIALLY

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:49.693
MEDI CAL SO WE ARE PAYING.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.394

MONEY -- IF YOU'RE A PERSON WITH

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.233
DISABILITIES YOU CAN'T WORK

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.302
ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE YOU

BASICALLY.

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:00.637
MAKE IF YOU MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:02.606
YOU FALL OUT RIGHT SO WE'RE

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:04.074
WE'VE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:06.744
TRAPPING PEOPLE INTO -- INTO

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.246
POVERTY ESSENTIALLY IN ORDER TO

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.248
GET TO THE SIDE TO SERVICES AND

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:13.283
AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW FROM A FROM

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.918
A STATE BUDGETARY STANDPOINT --

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:16.520
THAT'S ALSO AN ISSUE TOO BECAUSE

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.689
WE BAY IS THAT THE WISEST USE OF

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:19.923
OUR MONEY IS BASICALLY SAY YOU

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.824
KNOW WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS WE

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:22.393
WANT EVERYONE TO SPEND DOWN INTO

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:24.161
POVERTY AND THEN TRAP THEM THERE

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.062
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN THEY CAN

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:27.498
ACCESS THE SERVICES BECAUSE WE

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:28.799

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:30.334
SUPPORT SERVICES.

00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:32.136
SO WHAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:33.137
IS THAT OKAY WE WILL CREATE A

00:44:33.203 --> 00:44:34.905
FRAMEWORK TO SAY ALL RIGHT WELL

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:38.509
WHAT CAN WE TRY TO DO -- IN. TO

00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:40.444
SET UP A PROGRAM YOU YOU MADE

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:41.545
THE AND WE MENTIONED CAL SAVERS

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:42.379
YOU MENTIONED SOCIAL SECURITY

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:43.414
BUT LET ME WE HAVE TO THINK

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.448
ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE A

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.649
STRUCTURE KNOWING THAT WE HAVE

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:48.352
AN AGING POPULATION WE HAVE.

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.186
FOUR PEOPLE THIS THE ONLY PEOPLE

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:51.121
DISABILITIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:54.324
TO BE ABLE TO LEAD ACTIVE LIVES

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:55.459
AND ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE.

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:56.627
IN MANY WAYS INCLUDING

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:58.262
ECONOMICALLY TO OUR COMMUNITY

00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.329
AND SHOULD WE TRY TO CREATE

00:44:59.396 --> 00:45:01.298
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND AND THAT

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:02.299
I THINK THAT WHAT WE NEED TO

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:03.567
THINK ABOUT AND SO HIGH AND HOW

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:04.601
WHAT WOULD THAT TAKE.

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:06.103
RIGHT WHAT WITH THAT TAKES YOU

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:07.104
POSE THAT QUESTION AND THAT'S

00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:08.372
WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:09.306
THAT'S WAY AM.

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:10.808
PLEASED TO HAVE THE TREASURER'S

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:11.708
OFFICE.

00:45:11.775 --> 00:45:12.576
US IN SUPPORT BECAUSE WE WHILE

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:13.877
WORKING AND AND AND DO THAT

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:15.612
ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS AND SAY WHAT

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:16.713
WOULD IT TAKE BECAUSE YOU

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.116
MENTIONED WE HAVE A PRIVATE LONG

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:21.018
TERM CARE INSURANCE -- THAT IS

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:23.954
NOT WORKING RIGHT IT'S WE HAVE A

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:26.190
THE THE THE THE THAT COVERAGE IS

00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:28.092
NOT REALLY THAT AVAILABLE IT'S

00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:30.294
EXPENSIVE -- THERE'S A LOT OF

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.862
ADVERSE SELECTION ISSUES THAT

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:32.429
ARE INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:37.601
EXPENSE SO WE NEED TO THINK.

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:38.569
ABOUT WHAT HOW CAN WE GO ABOUT

00:45:38.635 --> 00:45:39.203
CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:42.005
THAT MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS.

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:43.540
HAVE ANOTHER OPTION OTHER THAN

00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:44.908
SPENDING DOWN THE POVERTY THE

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:46.043
OTHER THING IS IS THAT

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:46.810
OFTENTIMES THE RULES THAT WE

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:47.878
CREATE NELLY TO TRAP PEOPLE

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:49.446
POVERTY SOMETIMES EVEN PUSH THEM

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:51.014
TOWARD INSTITUTIONALIZATION

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:53.283
WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY EXPENSIVE

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.118
AND BY THE WAY WE'RE BEARING THE

00:45:54.184 --> 00:45:54.651
BILL OF THAT.

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.253
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS --

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.721
BECAUSE THEY GO IN MEDI CAL AND

00:45:57.788 --> 00:45:58.288
THEN THAT'S THE ONLY CHOICE

00:45:58.355 --> 00:46:01.492
PEOPLE HALF AND SO -- YEAH WE

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:02.626
WANT TO THINK ABOUT.

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:04.528
CAN WE THINK IT THINK ABOUT HOW

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:08.232
WE WE THEN BE ABLE TO USE

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:12.102
WHATEVER FUNDING WE WE ESTABLISH.

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.137
TO DE BE ABLE TO USE IT MORE

00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:14.671
WISELY IN A WAY THAT LETS PEOPLE

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:15.806
BETTER.

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:18.275
LIVE IN PLACE AN AGING PLACE AND

00:46:18.342 --> 00:46:19.943
AND SO FORTH AS WELL SO BUT

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:20.978
THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE FIGURED

00:46:21.044 --> 00:46:21.979
OUT AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.046

THE FOSTER PARENTS I'VE HAD THAT

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:08.350

WHERE I WOULD BE IF THEY DIDN'T

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.157
DECIDE TO STEP UP AND GO THE

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:18.126
EXTRA MILE -- AND HERE'S WHERE I

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:20.462
BECOME INEVITABLE INEVITABLY

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.097
PESSIMISTIC -- BECAUSE MY

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:23.231
BROTHER AND MY YOUNGER BROTHER

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:25.133
HE WASN'T AFFORDED THE SAME

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.501
QUALITY CARE IS ME.

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:27.769
A SOME OF THE FOSTER PARENTS HE

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:29.037
WAS UNDER THE CARE OF DID THE

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:32.240
BARE MINIMUM -- HE LOVES SPORTS

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:34.076
BUT HEARD NO SO MANY TIMES WHEN

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:35.277
IT CAME TO ASK.

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:37.746
ASKING FOR MONEY US SUPPORT INTO

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:39.181
GETTING INTO CAMPS AND GETTING

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:41.716
FOOTBALL GEAR BECAUSE THE COST.

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:43.018
AND FOREVER WHATEVER REASON THE

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:44.186
FOSTER PARENTS DID NOT PROVIDE

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:45.887
HELP IN GETTING HIM INTO

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:46.855
ANYTHING HE REALLY WANTS TO GET

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:47.456
INTO.

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:49.224
AND THAT INCLUDES WRESTLING AND

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.659
BOXING.

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:51.259
SO.

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:52.894
UNFORTUNATELY HE FOUND HIS

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:53.462
BELONGING ELSEWHERE IN THE

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:55.897
STREETS WHERE HE COULD PUT THAT

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:58.300
ENERGY AND CURIOSITY TO USE --

01:18:58.366 --> 01:19:00.435
AN IDOL I BELIEVE THAT HE'S.

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.971
SMARTER OR YOU KNOW JUST AS

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.106
SMART AS ME AND YET HIS STORY

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:05.740
HAS A DIFFERENT OUTCOME DUE. TO

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.542
THE DIFFERENCE IN CARE THAT HE

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:09.478
RECEIVED -- LIKE I MENTIONED

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:10.679
BEFORE I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:12.414
EXTRA MILES TAKEN ON BEHALF OF

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.349
SOME OF MY CARE TAKERS BUT IT

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:16.251
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A TO LOOK

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:16.818
THAT A YOUTH IS PLACE WITH

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:19.955
SOMEONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:22.190
A CHILD PURSUE THEIR INCHES -- I

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:22.791
FEEL LIKE ALL FOSTER PARENTS

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:23.859
SHOULD HAVE THE SUPPORT IN THIS

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:25.427
AREA SO THAT THE QUALITY OF THAT

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:27.629
CHILD'S UPBRINGING IS IT LEFT UP

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:29.231
TO CHANCE.

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:29.798
AS I THINK BACK OUT ALL THE

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:30.465
OUTLETS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.134
MY GREATEST QUALITIES ALSO

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.435
REMEMBER THE LASTING FRIENDSHIPS

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:35.570
AND SKILLS OF COMMUNICATION AND

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:38.039
DRIVE FOR ADVOCACY THAT I'VE

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:38.507
TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:39.407
EXPERIENCES.

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:41.376
NAY REALLY GROUNDS ME AND

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:42.010
STABILIZES AND YOU STILL TO THIS

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:42.511
DAY.

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:45.313
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.149
FAR AWAY I MOVE AWAY.

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.550
THOSE THINGS WILL ALWAYS MOVE

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.519
WITH ME ITS STABILITY I CAN TAKE

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:52.087
WITH ME ANYWHERE I GO.

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:53.121
AND HONESTLY IS REALLY A SMALL

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:54.589
PRICE TO PAY FOR SUCH A LONG

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.124
TERM EFFECTS THAT TRULY SHAPE

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:57.659
THE CHILD AND INSTILL WITH THEM

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:59.027
THE DRIVE TO DEVELOP THEIR

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:01.062
IDENTITY THEIR PASSION AND THEIR

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.097
FRIENDSHIPS.

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:03.798
IT SURE HELPED ME.

01:20:03.865 --> 01:20:05.500
AND IF WE STOP LEAVING IT UP TO

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:06.801
CHANCE THAT A CHILD RECEIVES

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:08.036
HELPING GETTING TO PARTICIPATE

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:10.238
IN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES OR

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:12.340
THINGS THAT THEY LOVE TO DO.

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:13.508
JUST IMAGINE HOW MANY CHILDREN

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:15.410
WILL GET A FIGHTING CHANCE.

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:15.977
TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:16.945
DESTINY.

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.146
I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT I'M NOT

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:19.948
RARE.

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:21.616
JUST A PRODUCT OF RARE QUALITY

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:21.917
OF BRINGING.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:25.654
ANDACCOUNTABILITY IS IS

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.290
SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:28.857
ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN YOU HAVE

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.859
CONTROL AND SO FOR THESE REASONS

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:32.861
ACTUALLY TO SUPPORT AS BE. TWO

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:37.098
ONE NINE TODAY THANK YOU.

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:38.800
THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.202
YES MY NAME IS LUCY SELFIE THE

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:41.469
CARTER IN THE POLICY ADVOCATE

01:20:41.536 --> 01:20:42.304
WITH THE YOUTH LAWCENTER AS YOU

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:44.139
HEARD FROM MS JOHNSON

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:44.773
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ARE

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:45.473
VITAL.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.341
THEY CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:48.510
BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD OUTCOMES

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:49.644
FOR FOSTER YOUTH THEY CAN MAKE

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:50.845
ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN GIVING

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:52.948
FOSTER YOUTH THE SKILLS

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:54.482
CONNECTIONS AND STABILITY.

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.584
THAT WILL TAKE THEM BEYOND

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.953
FOSTER CARE TWO HEALTHY AND

01:20:58.019 --> 01:20:59.087
PRODUCTIVE ADULTHOOD.

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:01.256
THE RESEARCH FULLY SUPPORTS MISS

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.658
JOHNSON STORY STUDIES SHOW THAT

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:04.826
PARTICIPATION IN EXTRACURRICULAR

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.094
IS HELP YOUNG PEOPLE DEVELOP

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.329
RESILIENCE.

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:08.330
ACCOMPLISH IMPORTANT

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:10.265
DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS AND

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:11.633
COUNTERACT THE HARMFUL EFFECTS

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.401
OF TRAUMA.

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:14.469
IT RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS A

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.671
PARTICIPATION IN EXTRACURRICULAR

01:21:16.738 --> 01:21:18.873
IS IMPROVED ACADEMIC OUTCOMES IT

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.976
ALSO REDUCES YOUTH PARTICIPATION

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:23.144
IN RISKY BEHAVIORS.

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.746
EXTRACURRICULAR SO IMPORTANT FOR

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:25.747
ALL YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.749
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:29.718
FOSTER YOUTH WHO FACE TRAUMA

01:21:29.784 --> 01:21:31.419
INSTABILITY IN LOSS OF SUPPORT

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:33.321
OF CONNECTIONS.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.990
BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS MISS

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:36.524
JOHNSON POINTED OUT THEY'RE NOT

01:21:36.591 --> 01:21:39.194
AVAILABLE FROM MOST FOSTER YOUTH.

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:40.962
IT'S THE LUCK OF THE DRAW

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:41.596
WHETHER THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN A

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:43.131
COUNTY THAT IS FIGURED OUT SOME

01:21:43.198 --> 01:21:44.633
EXTRA FUNDING FOR THIS.

01:21:44.699 --> 01:21:46.167
OR HAPPEN TO BE IN A FAMILY THAT

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:47.669
CAN AFFORD IT.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:48.737
AND WE KNOW THAT EXTRA

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:50.005
CURRICULAR AREN'T CHEAP.

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:51.506
ALL OF US WHO ARE PARENTS OR

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:52.974
CAREGIVERS IN THE ROOM.

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:55.744
BALLET LESSONS SAT PREP MUSICAL

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.379
INSTRUMENTS THAT COST REAL MONEY

01:21:57.445 --> 01:21:59.347
AND FOSTER PARENTS DON'T HAVE

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:00.982
THIS MONEY.

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:02.917
SO SENATE BILL TWO ONE NINE WILL

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.953
ALLOW FOR COUNTIES TO PILOT

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.821
PROVIDING GRANTS TO FOSTER YOUTH

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:07.956
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:09.324
SO THAT IT'S NOT LEFT UP TO

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:11.393
CHANCE WHETHER THESE YOUTH CAN

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:12.994
PARTICIPATE IN THESE ACTIVITIES.

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:15.297
IT'S OUR HOPE THAT SB TWO ONE

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:16.097
NINE WILL LEAD TO STATEWIDE
