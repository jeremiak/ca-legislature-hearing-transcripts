TEACHING A LESSON. WHERE SHE

HI ALL CONDEMN THE TEACHER'S

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:43.200
BEHAVIOR WHICH WAS HIGHLY

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:45.369
INAPPROPRIATE AND OFFENSIVE. I

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:46.770
WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS MORNING

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:48.772
HOWEVER THAT THIS ISN'T THIS IS

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.774
AND WAS NOT AN ISOLATED

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.810
INCIDENT. THIS WAS NOT THE

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.478
FIRST TIME THAT THIS PARTICULAR

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.900
INACCURATE AND HARMFUL WAY.

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:17.835
THIS IS BENNETT ONGOING FAILURE

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.336
ACROSS THE AMERICAN SCHOOL

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:21.472
SYSTEM FOR GENERATIONS AND

EUROCENTRIC ACCOUNT OF HISTORY

00:42:39.823 --> 00:42:41.592
THAT'S GOOD. NOT ONLY HAS THIS

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:43.394
PREVENTED STUDENTS FROM HAVING

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.929
A RICHER MORE ACCURATE

00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:46.597

DIFFERENT RACIAL AND ETHNIC

01:22:25.307 --> 01:22:27.175
SUBGROUPS BUT EVENTUALLY CAME

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:28.677
TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:30.845
ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY GAP

01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:33.081
WHERE AS THE CHAIRMAN INDICATED

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:34.949
WE HAVE OVER A LACK OF

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:37.252
RESOURCES THAT ARE ACTUALLY

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.954
DEDICATED TO NARROWING AND

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:41.790
EVENTUALLY ELIMINATING THE

SLIDESHOW. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:02.110
THE SUBJECT OF YOUR INTEREST AS

STATEMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:23.732
FINDS THAT THE LACK OF ACCURATE

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:25.433
AND COMPLETE CURRICULUM MAY

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.502

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:29.304
ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN INDIAN

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:35.310
PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS BILL.

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:37.645
HOWEVER AND I THINK THAT THERE

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:39.581
IS A HANDOUT FOR YOU OF THE

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:43.885

NATIVE AMERICAN TEACHERS IN THE

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:02.970
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:04.304
KNOW THAT A LOT OF THIS WOULD

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:06.974
BE ON TOP BY NON NATIVE

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.076

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:16.450
DID THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:18.785
DEAL WITH THAT COMPONENT-

01:44:18.852 --> 01:44:19.786
CONTINUE TO MOVE PIECES OF

01:44:19.853 --> 01:44:22.522

01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:26.827
AWARENESS OF THE NATIVE.

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:27.394

IF I AM- BEING MAKING LIGHT OF

01:44:35.902 --> 01:44:37.971
THE QUESTION BUT OF COURSE

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:40.307
EVERY STATE KNOWS. THERE'S

01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:40.974
NEVER GONNA BE ENOUGH MONEY. TO

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:45.379
DO. THE BEST THAT WE PLANT THEM

01:44:45.445 --> 01:44:48.181

01:44:51.284 --> 01:44:52.686
THAT ARE AT OUR DISPOSAL AND

01:44:52.753 --> 01:44:55.856
THAT'S WHY I THINK SO. IT WAS

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:59.960

GRANDPARENTS AS THEY TALKED AND

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:15.080

IT WAS I GUESS EIGHT OF DIALECT

02:14:18.283 --> 02:14:20.118

CHILDREN. AT THREE POINTS TODAY

02:31:43.561 --> 02:31:45.496
FIRST POINT IS IT CERTAINLY IS

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:47.531
NOT THE LOCAL LEVEL. MIGHTN'T

02:31:47.598 --> 02:31:49.433
DURING A OF MY CHILDREN'S

02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:51.469
UPBRINGING I WAS IN SCHOOLS ALL

02:31:51.535 --> 02:31:53.170
THE TIME SAYING THIS CURRICULUM

02:31:53.237 --> 02:31:54.805
IS THAT RIGHT IT'S NOT FAIR TO

THAT WASN'T THE ANSWER MY

02:32:01.612 --> 02:32:03.581
CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER MY

02:32:03.647 --> 02:32:05.382

OF OUR TRIBE HOOPA TRIBE.

02:32:08.953 --> 02:32:11.121
SECOND POINT AT GOVERNMENT TO

02:32:11.188 --> 02:32:12.756
GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS MATTER

02:32:12.823 --> 02:32:14.492
LOCALLY I THINK WE HAD SOME

02:32:14.558 --> 02:32:15.593
GREAT EXAMPLES TODAY FROM

02:32:15.659 --> 02:32:18.229
SHASTA COUNTY. AS WELL AS FROM

02:32:18.295 --> 02:32:20.364
THE HOOPA YUROK IT'S A NON WAY

02:32:20.431 --> 02:32:22.399
AND KRUG AREA THAT AT MARGO

02:32:22.466 --> 02:32:24.101
ROBBINS SHARED TODAY SO I THINK

02:32:24.168 --> 02:32:25.436
THERE'S SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OUT

02:32:25.503 --> 02:32:29.573
THERE. AS WELL AS OUR- OTHER

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:30.474
STATE FROM WASHINGTON. GREAT

02:32:30.541 --> 02:32:31.775
RELATIONSHIPS UP THERE AND I

02:32:31.842 --> 02:32:33.010
THINK THEY HAVE A PROVEN TRACK

02:32:33.077 --> 02:32:34.879
RECORD OF WE CAN'T USE WORDS

02:32:34.945 --> 02:32:36.780
LIKE ENCOURAGE. IT MUST BE

02:32:36.847 --> 02:32:38.482
SHALL I THINK STATEWIDE

02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:39.750
CURRICULUMS ARE IMPORTANT AS

02:32:39.817 --> 02:32:41.585
FRAMEWORKS BUT LIKE ASSEMBLYMAN

02:32:41.652 --> 02:32:43.420
RAMOS POINTED OUT. WE ARE NOT

02:32:43.487 --> 02:32:44.889
MONOLITHIC IT NEEDS TO BE

02:32:44.955 --> 02:32:46.724
APPLICABLE TO EACH REGIONAL

02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:48.826
AREA BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY.

02:32:48.893 --> 02:32:50.661
AND THEN MY THIRD POINT IS THAT

02:32:50.728 --> 02:32:52.229
NOT ONLY IS KNOWLEDGE BUILDING

02:32:52.296 --> 02:32:54.164
IMPORTANT IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

02:32:54.231 --> 02:32:55.966
I THINK THAT'S ONE APPROACH BUT

02:32:56.033 --> 02:32:57.001
IT DEFINITELY THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:32:57.067 --> 02:32:58.602
KNOWLEDGE BUILDING. FOR FOLKS

02:32:58.669 --> 02:33:00.538
