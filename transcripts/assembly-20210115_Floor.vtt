00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:31.995
DR KING STATED AS BROTHERS IN

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:34.831
THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. I STILL

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:36.533
HAD A FELLOWSHIP AND GOOD WILL

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.568

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:40.370
TO YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS. OUR

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:43.473
SEPARATE STRUGGLES ARE REALLY

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.909
ONE. A STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM FOR

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:48.178
DIGNITY FOR HUMANITY. THE

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:53.049

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:00.924
JUSTICE UNLESS WE ALL HAVE

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:03.927
JUSTICE. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:06.663
HAVE SEEN A PANDEMIC THAT HAS

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:07.197
DEVASTATED OUR VULNERABLE

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:09.933
COMMUNITIES. MANY OF THEM BROWN

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.770

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:16.373
MOVEMENT FOR RACIAL JUSTICE.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:16.973

REJECT OUR DEMOCRATIC

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:30.520
TRADITIONS. TRADITIONS OF

NONVIOLENT PROTEST. A PEACEFUL

DEBATE. THE DEBATE BASED ON

00:51:39.362 --> 00:51:43.066
FACTS AND FREE OF VIOLENCE.

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:44.334
THESE ARE THE TRADITIONS THAT

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:45.802
ALLOW US TO EXIST TOGETHER AS A

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:49.573
NATION. THAT ALLOW US TO MOVE

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:52.609

AN INESCAPABLE NETWORK TIED TO

00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:13.063

CAUCUS I WRITE IN SUPPORT OF A

00:52:56.406 --> 00:52:59.509
C. R. E. DR KING'S LEGACY IS

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:00.877
ROOTED IN THE FIGHT OF THE

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.312
QUALITY AND THE FIGHT AGAINST

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:04.347
INJUSTICE FOR NONVIOLENCE.

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:05.482
HONORING HIS MEMORY WITH THIS

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:06.917
RESOLUTION DURING A TIME OF

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:09.786
SUCH CIVIL UNREST IT'S RAINING.

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:11.121
IF DR KING WERE HERE TODAY TO

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:12.389
WITNESS THE STATE OF AMERICA

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:14.357
TODAY I IMAGINE HE WOULD NOTE

00:53:14.424 --> 00:53:15.458
THAT WHILE THE FLAMES OF

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:16.626
DIVISION ARE BURNING HOT RIGHT

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:19.496
NOW. THEY BURN FROM THE FUEL OF

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:21.197
PROGRESS. THE VIOLENCE WE

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:22.198
WITNESS AGAINST OUR BROTHERS

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:24.734
AND SISTERS AGAINST DEMOCRACY

00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:27.170
ARE THE CRY OF A DYING INEQUITY.

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:28.004
ALL OF THE VIOLENCE IN REGIONS

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:28.905
LIKE THE SHOOTING OF A

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.640
CONDITION THAT OUR SOCIETY CAN

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:34.010
NO LONGER BEAR. DR KING WOULD

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:34.578
ENCOURAGE US TO SEEK JUSTICE

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:37.080
AND PEACE. THROUGH NONVIOLENCE

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.182
EDUCATION AND THROUGH THE POWER

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:39.749
OF OUR FEARS AS WEAPONS THE

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:42.319
BALANCE. THESE LAST YEARS HAVE

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:43.853
BEEN SOME OF THE MOST DIVISIVE

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.289
TIMES IN HISTORY. WE HAVE SEEN

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:47.057
SOME OF THE WORST IN OUR

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:48.625
SOCIETY BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.493
OF HATE AND FEAR AND ANGER AND

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.228
IGNORANCE TO FLOW FULLY THAT

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:54.564
FREELY AMONG US. AS WITH

00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:57.200
DIVISION WIND. DR KING KNEW.

00:53:57.267 --> 00:53:59.869
THAT WE NEEDED LOVE AND WISDOM

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:00.837
AND COMPASSION TOWARD ONE

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:02.539
ANOTHER. AND A FEELING OF

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:04.541
JUSTICE TOWARD THOSE WHO STILL

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:06.810
SUFFER WITHIN OUR COUNTRY. AND

00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:09.179
IF PAINFUL AS IT MAY BE FOR

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:10.080
SOME OF US DID NOT THAT THAT

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:12.749
TENANT. WHEN IT IS SO EASY TO

00:54:12.816 --> 00:54:13.950
SPEAK ILL OF SOMEONE WHO ANGERS

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:16.319
US OR IGNORE THE OPINIONS OF

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:17.120
THOSE WE DISAGREE WITH BECAUSE

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:19.623
IT'S EASY. WE ALL KNOW IN OUR

00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:23.226
HEART IT'S RIGHT. LOVE WISDOM

00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:27.230
COMPASSION JUSTICE SIMPLE WORDS

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:29.065
TO UNDERSTAND BUT DIFFICULT TO

00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:31.401
PUT INTO PRACTICE. I LEARNED

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:32.636
MANY OF THESE LESSONS IN CHURCH

00:54:32.702 --> 00:54:34.371
AND SCHOOL DEALING WITH FRIENDS

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:35.905
AND BEING WITH FAMILY MY

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:36.973
PARENTS WORK TO INSTILL THESE

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.609
VALUES IN ME AND I STRIVE TO DO

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:40.243
THE SAME FOR MY DAUGHTER. EVERY

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.646
DAY. MY MOM SHOWED ME HOW TO

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:43.913
LEAD AND WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.682
AND DOING SO. SHE WORKED TO

00:54:45.749 --> 00:54:47.217
BRING ABOUT EQUALITY AND A

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:49.152
POSITIVE CHANGE. AND I LEARNED

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:51.821
THAT'S HOW WE SHOW OUR LOVE AND

00:54:51.888 --> 00:54:52.455
OUR COMPASSION FOR OUR BROTHERS

00:54:52.522 --> 00:54:54.691
AND SISTERS. I BELIEVE IN THAT

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:56.059
MISSION SO MUCH THAT I FOLLOWED

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.394
IN HER FOOTSTEPS AND I STAND

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.695

AN I. BEAM WITH PRIDE AND HONOR

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:04.801
AT THIS DISTINCTION. THAT WE

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:07.237
SHARE IN THIS CHAMBER. BUT AT

00:55:07.303 --> 00:55:09.706
THE SAME TIME. I LOOK AT YOU

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:11.408
ALL AND I DON'T SEE A LOT OF

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:13.977
PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME. WE

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:15.945
KNOW THE PHRASE REPRESENTATION

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:16.513
MATTERS AND I BELIEVE IN IT

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:19.082
WHOLEHEARTEDLY. I THINK CARLA

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.450

00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:35.699
DAUGHTER GOES TO SEE SOMETHING

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:37.167
LIKE THIS. AND IT'S NOT AN

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:40.904
EXCEPTION. I AM HUMBLED BY DR

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.839
KING'S LEGACY AND HIS VISION

00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:44.607
FOR OUR NATION. BUT I MUST

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:45.909
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING IN THIS

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:46.443
CHAMBER WHERE WE DO THE

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:49.579
PEOPLE'S WORK. IS A STARK

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:50.180
REMINDER THAT WE STILL HAVE A

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:52.315
WAYS TO GO. WE TALK ABOUT

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:54.017
INCLUSION AND EQUITY. AND

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.652
EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AND ONE

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.253
WAY TO FULFILL THOSE GOALS IS

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.555
TO UPLIFT WOMEN. PEOPLE OF

00:55:58.621 --> 00:55:59.689
COLOR. AND THOSE IN

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:00.690
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:02.992
OTHERS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:04.627
THAT REPRESENTATION HERE.

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:06.196
