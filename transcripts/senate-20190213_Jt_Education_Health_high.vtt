00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.710
AND MAYBE A GRANT PROGRAM LATEST

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:18.511
THAT.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:19.679
IT ALSO GO TO THE BOARD OF STATE

SERVICES AND FINALLY --

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:33.226
FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION 60% OF

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:34.127
THAT --

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:35.928
ALLOCATION THREE WOULD GO TO THE

ACCOUNT --

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:40.566
WHICH WOULD --

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:42.135
GO TO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.703
SERVICES TO WORK IN CONJUNCTION

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.538
WITH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

PLEASE.

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:02.622
GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN

CHAIR AND SENATORS I'M SEND YOU

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:04.490
PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:05.792
ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I'M ALSO

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:06.926
JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE MARK

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:07.593
NEWTON WHO IS THE DEPUTY

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.062
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OF HEALTH

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.031
AND HUMAN SERVICES AT THE LA --

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.166
MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL OFFER

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.066
SOME OVER ARCHING THOUGHTS ON

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:14.901
THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.102
IMPLEMENTING --

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.336
THE USE ACCOUNT.

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:18.371
AND TO THAT END ALL FIRST

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:20.173
DISCUSS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:21.941
ARE UNRESOLVED IN THE LANGUAGE

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.643
OF GOVERNING THE USE ACCOUNT AND

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.578
THEN I'LL MOVE ON AND DISCUSS

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:26.379
FIVE KEY.

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:27.980
ISSUES WE RAISE FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:29.248
CONSIDERATION.

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:30.316
YOU SHOULD HAVE A HANDOUT

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:33.452
ASSOCIATED WITH MY COMMENTS OKAY

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.755
GREAT.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:36.422
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE WE

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:39.125
PROVIDE A LIST OF THE UNRESOLVED

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:40.126
ISSUES IN THE YOUTH ACCOUNT

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.561
LANGUAGE THESE INCLUDE FOR

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:44.197
EXAMPLE --

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:46.532
THE LANGUAGE IS SILENT ON A

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.534
SPENDING PRIORITIES FROM AMONG A

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.803
LOT A LONG LIST OF PERMISSIVE

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.538
ACTIVITIES IT'S ALSO SILENT ON

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:54.207
HOW THE THREE DEPARTMENTS SHOULD

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:56.375
WORK TOGETHER. ONE IMPORTANT

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:57.610
AREA THAT IT'S SILENT ON IS THE

00:07:57.677 --> 00:07:59.579
ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:01.147
MENTION THE LEGISLATURE AT ALL.

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:03.015
AND IMPORTANTLY IT CONTINUOUSLY

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:05.418
APPROPRIATES THE FUNDS TO THE

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:05.952
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.019
SERVICES.

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:08.754
DESPITE THIS WE ASSUME THAT THE

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:10.489
LEGISLATURE CAN USE ITS GENERAL

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:12.458
OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY WHEN IT

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.360
COMES TO IMPLEMENTING THE USE

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.628
ACCOUNT FUNDS.

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:17.230
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF SOME OF

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:18.965
THESE UNRESOLVED ISSUES.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:21.767
AND WE THINK THAT IN DOING THIS --

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.069
WHAT IT CAN REALLY DO IS HELP

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:25.371
GUIDE THE DECISION MAKING BY THE

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:27.106
THREE DEPARTMENTS AND PROVIDE A

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.908
FRAMEWORK FOR DECISION MAKING?

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:29.508
AND WE THINK THAT THE

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:30.943
LEGISLATURE CAN BE GUIDED BY

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.211
SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.513
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.715
SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:36.916
SERVICES ACT.

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:37.850
AND YOU'LL KNOW IN THE HAND OUT

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:41.854
THERE'S A NUMBER OF SOMETHING

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:42.755
THAT WAS BASED ON A LESSON.

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:45.458
LESSON LEARNED FROM PROPOSITION.

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:46.092
SIXTY THREE SO IF YOU TURN TO

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:48.828
PAGE THREE WILL RAISE OUR ISSUES

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:50.596
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION.

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.164
THE FIRST IS THIS NOTION OF

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.367
IDENTIFYING OUTCOMES TO ACHIEVE

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.369
THE LANGUAGE IN PROPOSITION

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.670
SIXTY FOUR IS SILENT ON WHAT OUT

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.405
SPECIFIC OUTCOMES IT HOPES TO

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:00.873
ACHIEVE WITH THE SPENDING OF THE

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.141
YOUTH ACCOUNTED DEFINITELY

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.242
IDENTIFIES SOME.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.044
A PERMISSIVE ACTIVITIES BUT NOT

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:06.312
THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.280
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:11.350
LEGISLATURE STATE IN STATUTE THE

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:11.951
THREE TO FIVE YOU KNOW SMALL

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.419
HANDFUL OF OUTCOMES THAT IT

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.654
HOPES TO ACHIEVE WITH THE

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.688
SPENDING.

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.290
AND IDENTIFY MEASURABLE TARGETS

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.624
ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.493
OUTCOMES WE THINK THAT THIS CAN

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:22.395
REALLY SET UP A FRAMEWORK FOR

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:23.329
DECISION MAKING BY THE

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.165
DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'LL FLOW

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.133
FROM THESE GOALS.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:29.068
SECOND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.570
LEGISLATURE STATE ITS INTENT ON

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:34.440
OVERALL PREFERENCES AS WELL AS

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:36.309
PREFERENCES FOR HOW IT WANTS TO

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:37.877
CONDUCT OVERSIGHT AND WHAT

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.578
REPORTING IT WANTS TO REQUIRE OF

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:41.681
THE THREE DEPARTMENTS --

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:42.682
FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:44.183
COULD STATE ITS INTENT TO THAT

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.818
THE INITIAL FUNDING BE USED FOR

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.453
EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES ONLY

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.622
AND THAT EASE PILOT PROGRAMS TO

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:50.489
TEST --

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.525
PROMISING PRACTICES AND INCLUDE

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:55.661
A FORMAL EVALUATION REQUIREMENT.

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:57.563
TURNING TO PAGE FOR OUR THIRD

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.598
ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO RAISE IS

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:01.200
HELLO THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.601
FACILITATE ITS OVERSIGHT WITH

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.103
THE CREATION OF A TECHNICAL

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.538
ADVISORY COMMITTEE.

00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:07.039
WHAT WE SUGGEST HERE IS THAT IT

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.875
COULD CREATE A SMALL GROUP OF?

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.911
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXPERTISE

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:13.746
IN TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND AND

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:15.114
DATA --

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.482
USING DATA.

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:17.149
AND WE THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:19.852
CAN HELP LATER IN THE

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:21.287
DEPARTMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:23.622
IMPORTANT DECISIONS SUCH AS HOW

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:24.890
TO SET UP EVALUATIONS FROM THE

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:26.525
OUTSET WHAT DO YOU DO NEED TO

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.027
COLLECT IN ORDER TO DO THOSE

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.862
EVALUATIONS.

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:31.063
IT COULD ALSO HELP ASSESS --

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.800
SERVICE NEEDS AND SERVICE GAPS.

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:36.335
I'M TURNING TO PAGE FIVE OUR

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:37.136
FOURTH --

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:39.905
ISSUE WE WANTED TO RAISE IS.

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.307
HOW TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:43.075
ISSUES THAT WERE LEFT UNRESOLVED

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.710
IN THE LANGUAGE --

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.145
THERE'S SOME DECISIONS THAT MAY

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:47.646
NEED TO BE.

00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:49.882
CONSIDERED AT THE OUTSET SO FOR

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:51.283
EXAMPLE AND THIS IS A LESSON

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.886
LEARNED FROM PROPOSITION.

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.221
SIXTY THREE HOW DO YOU WANT TO

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:57.356
HANDLE UNSPENT FUNDS BY FOR

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:58.758
EXAMPLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD

00:10:58.824 --> 00:10:59.658
THEY BE ALLOWED TO KEEP A

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:01.060
RESERVE WHEN SHOULD THE FUNDS

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:04.330
RESERVE REVERT BACK TO THE STATE --

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:05.698
THERE ALSO DECISIONS THAT SHOULD

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:07.700
BE MADE ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:09.168
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:10.636
AND THIS IS ANOTHER LESSON

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:12.371
LEARNED FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:13.539
THREE WE THINK THAT DETERMINING

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:15.107
THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.776
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES VERSUS

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.078
TREATMENT ACTIVITIES IS GOING TO

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.679
BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE.

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:22.848
AND RATHER THAN LOCKING IN THOSE

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:24.583
PROPORTIONAL ALLOCATIONS WE

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.651
THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE A

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:27.253
FLEXIBLE DECISION IT SHOULD BE

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:28.788
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:29.789
COULD.

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:31.357
REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENTS TO

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:34.026
RECONSIDER ON AND MAYBE AN ON A

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:35.127
REGULAR BASIS AND PERHAPS

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.296
ANNUALLY WITH GUIDANCE FROM THE

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.697
TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.933
AM BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.435
THE PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES.

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.369
ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING THAT

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:44.970
WILL NEED TO BE CONSIDERED ON AN

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.939
ANNUAL BASIS IS WHETHER THE

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:49.075
FUNDING SHOULD BE --

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:51.110
ALLOCATED VIA COMPETITIVE GRANTS

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:53.079
OR FUNDING FORMULAS AND ON THIS

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.413
WE THINK THERE MAY BE ROOM FOR

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.248
BOTH SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:57.683
EVIDENCE ON A PARTICULAR.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.584
ISSUE IS SPARSE IT MIGHT MAKE

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:02.254
SENSE IF TRANSPORTATION OUT --

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.190
PROMISING PRACTICES AND THEN

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:05.958
CONDUCTED EVALUATION WHEN THERE

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:07.460
IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE IN A GIVEN

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:09.161
AREA YOU COULD POTENTIALLY USE A

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.796
FUNDING FORMULA AND PROVIDE SORT

00:12:10.863 --> 00:12:12.832
OF A MENU OF OPTIONS OF EVIDENCE

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:13.933
BASED PRACTICES THAT LOCAL

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:16.035
GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER ENTITIES

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:17.036
COULD USE.

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:18.537
FINALLY OUR LAST POINT THAT WE

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.372
WANTED TO RAISE IS THAT THERE

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:21.941
WILL BE WORK FORCE NEEDS

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.375
ASSOCIATED WITH --

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:24.743
IMPLEMENTING THE USE ACCOUNT

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.712
FUNDS WE THINK THAT --

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:28.013
ASSESSING IN PLANNING FOR

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.348
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS AN

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.016
ACTIVITY THAT SHOULD HAPPEN AT

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.518
THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.153
STATEWIDE NEEDS COULD BE --

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.888
BETTER ASSESS THAT WAY WE ALSO

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:37.323
THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENTS IT

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:38.257
WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THE

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:40.092
DEPARTMENTS TO WORK WITH THE

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.561
LEGISLATURE ON ANY STATUTE THAT

00:12:42.628 --> 00:12:44.597
MIGHT BE NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT SAY

00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:47.099
AN INCENTIVE PROGRAMMER OR LOAN

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.634
FORGIVENESS THAT TYPE OF THING.

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:51.036
SO WTHOUT I'M ALSO HAPPY TO

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:54.173
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.740
THANK YOU.

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:58.277
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:00.579
YES CENTER STONE.

00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:02.781
ALL THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR YOUR

00:13:02.848 --> 00:13:05.251
PRESENTATIONS AND YOU CERTAINLY

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:09.788
OUTLINED SOME OF THE EMISSIONS

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:11.157
IF YOU WILL.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:12.791
OF INITIATIVES SO.

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:14.460
THE FIRST THING THAT I THINK WE

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:15.528
WE CERTAINLY NEED --

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:18.063
TO IDENTIFYING TACKLE IS --

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.899
THE DEFINITION OF YOUTH.

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:21.600
AND I'M ONLY SPEAKING FROM SOME

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:22.868
OF OUR EXPERIENCES ON THE

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:24.236
COMMITTEE WE ARE WE CAN LOOK A

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:25.971
CHRONOLOGICAL AGE OR WE CAN LOOK

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:27.506
AT BRAIN MATURATION AND BRING

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:29.475
NATURAIS XIN SEEMS TO BE --

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:32.578
A PREDOMINANT FACTOR --

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.512
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:34.079
BRAIN DOESN'T FULLY DEVELOP

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.248
UNTIL TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.416
AND SO -- I

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.651
WOULD COME TO THE CONCLUSION

00:13:38.717 --> 00:13:39.952
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:43.622
DEFINITION OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS --

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:47.393
FOR YOUNGER --

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:48.561
IDENTIFYING OUTCOMES I THINK IS

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:50.529
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT --

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:53.365
EDUCATING OUR YOUTH ABOUT THE

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:57.169
THE INTOXICATION HAZARDS OF OF

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:58.337
CANNABIS ESPECIALLY WHEN.

00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.205
GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:00.839
CAR FORCING A LOT.

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:02.374
MORE KIDS AND ADULTS FOR THAT

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:03.742
MATTER --

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:06.979
BEING ARRESTED FOR D. WHY IS

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:10.516
DRIVING UNDER THE THE DOCKS

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:11.617
CATION OF OF CANNABIS.

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:12.918
AND AND CERTAINLY --

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:13.919
EDUCATING OUR KIDS ABOUT THE

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:15.354
SYNERGY.

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:18.357
OF OTHER DRUGS INCLUDING ALCOHOL

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:20.359
WHEN MIXED WITH --

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:21.460
WITH CANNABIS.

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:24.463
AND AND ALSO THE HAZARDS OF

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.065
CONSUMING EDIBLES NOT

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:28.000
UNDERSTANDING THE CONCENTRATION

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.535
OF CANNABIS THAT IS IN THOSE

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:30.102
ARTICLES BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:31.403
THAT.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.104
I DON'T THERE'S ONE REPORTED

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:33.672
CASE OF ANYBODY --

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:34.940
DYING FROM AN OVERDOSE OF

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:36.642
INHALED CANNABIS BUT THERE HAVE

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.277
BEEN INSTANCES ESPECIALLY AND

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:39.745
AND CHILDREN OF PEOPLE EATING

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:42.615
APPLES AND SING ON UNFORTUNATE

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:45.150
DEATH SO.

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.586
MR SURE HOW THIS WILL WORK TO

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:49.622
ARE WE ARE WE LOOKING FOR A BILL

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:52.291
TO CLARIFY LANGUAGE OR HOW HOW

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:54.860
DOES THE LEGISLATURE --

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:56.829
PLACE THEIR INPUT BASED ON A

00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:59.131
CONSENSUS OF THE COMMITTEES

00:14:59.198 --> 00:14:59.431
[inaudible]

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:04.737
OF CAN I CAN I WEBER TORTURED

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:06.839
ASKING EVERYONE BECAUSE I'M

00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:08.907
LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER BUT WILL.

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.209
EXPLAIN.

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.610
AS I CAN LOOK AT THE ROLE THE

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:14.480
ROLE OF US AS IT HAD A COMMITTEE

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:15.080
TO TRYING --

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:15.614
TO FILLING THESE GAPS OF

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:18.350
INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT --

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.385
THINGS ARE DEFINED OUR GOALS ARE --

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:20.653
OUR FOR OUR FULLY OUTLINED WHAT

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:21.754
ARE THE STEPS FOR THE

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.589
LEGISLATURE TO ENACT THESE --

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:26.992
THESE VOIGTS IN THE AN

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:28.927
INITIATIVE.

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:30.396
IT'S WE WE DID CONSIDER THE

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:31.930
ISSUE IN DEPTH IN ONE AND

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:34.900
BELIEVE THAT THE HANDLING THIS

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:35.834
PROCESS THROUGH POLICY BILLS

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:38.704
PROBABLY MAKES THE MOST SENSE.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:39.305
AND NOW IT'S A PART OF THE

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.506
REASON WE'RE DOING THIS --

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:42.308
INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS TO

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.376
START TO GET THE OUTLINES WILL

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:45.477
BE HEARING FROM --

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:46.712
ADVOCATES AND AGENCIES AS WELL

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.715
AND THEY MAY HAVE SOME IDEAS TO

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.216
BUT VERY SECURITY SEE THIS IS A

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:55.454
A BILL OF THE COMMITTEE ALL COME

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.690
VERY IDEAS AND TESTIMONY THAT

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:58.257
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:01.627
COMMITTEE WOULD UNDERTAKE AS

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.495
MOBILE THE EIGHTH --

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:05.931
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:08.000
HAVE A THE SAID AFTER AFTER THIS

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:09.435
HEARING SEE WHAT DIRECTION SO.

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.936
THAT'S IN THE COMPARATIVE BUT

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:14.206
PEOPLE SUGGESTIONS ALWAYS OPEN

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.741
TO THOSE CELL THANK YOU I MEAN

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.243
AND OF YES I'M SORRY I WAS JUST

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.477
GOING.

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:19.111
TO MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT ABOUT

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:19.712
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:16:19.778 --> 00:16:20.813
MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO DO TO IS

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:21.380
WHEN YOU HAVE VERY SPECIFIC

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:25.884
IDEAS ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF

00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:27.653
POLICIES YOU WANNAPUT FORTH AND

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.320
CUT CONSULTING WITH LEGISLATIVE

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:29.722
COUNSEL AT THAT POINT TO

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:31.390
DETERMINE WILL WHAT'S ALLOWED

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:32.124
WHAT CAN WE DO.

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:34.193
WHAT A THREE DO WE HAVE MIGHT

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:35.494
MAKE SENSE?

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:37.363
THANK YOU SO MUCH CAN I MAKE

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:38.330
WHAT SIR CAN I MAKE ONE MORE

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:38.964
COMMENT TO ABOUT --

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:41.133
THE ISSUE YOU RAISED ON THE

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.034
DEFINITION OF USE.

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.235
WE AGREE THAT THAT DEFINITION

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:45.037
SHOULD PROBABLY BE KEPT BROAD

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:47.206
BECAUSE THIS SUBSTANCE USE

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:48.006
DISORDER CONF AFFECT A WIDE

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:48.841
RANGE.

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:50.909
OF AGES AND WE IN FACT RECOMMEND

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.344
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE STATING ITS

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:54.213
INTENT THAT.

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.347
THAT YOUTH BE KEPT THE

00:16:55.414 --> 00:16:58.283
DEFINITION BE KEPT VERY FINDING

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.651
THAT IT'S TWENTY FIVE OR UNDER

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:00.819
BUT IF YOU'VE ESTABLISHED THAT

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.488
FRAMEWORK OF OUTCOMES THAT YOU

00:17:02.554 --> 00:17:03.822
HOPE TO ACHIEVE.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.824
THEN THE THE SPENDING DECISIONS

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.192
THAT ARE MADE SHOULD TARGET

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:08.994
THOSE GOALS SO WHATEVER THE AGE

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.429
MIGHT BE I MEAN PERHAPS SOMEONE

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:11.897
COMES IN JUST OVER TWENTY FIVE

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:14.867

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:27.659
PUBLIC EDUCATION --

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:29.861
HOW CAN WE PARTNER WITH THOSE

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:31.330
THAT ARE TRYING TO DO?

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:35.500

SOMETIME WITHIN THE COMING DAYS --

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.856
IF THE ERROR OF THAT BUT SO FAR

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:59.358
ARE AT THIS MOMENT ALL THAT

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:01.059
WE'RE AWARE OF IS --

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:02.794
REVENUE THAT WAS COLLECTED FROM

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.429
THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FISCAL

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:06.632

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:07.666
PRIVATE LAST HALF OF THE PRIOR

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:08.900
FISCAL YEAR END.

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:11.637
AND COUNTING ONLY THAT REVENUE

00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:12.838
TO DATE --

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:14.106
YOU JUST FROM THAT FIRST QUARTER

00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:17.075
THE FISCAL YEAR IT STILL REMAINS

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:18.877
SORT OF ON CERTAIN CERTAINLY NOT

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:19.711
GUARANTEED WHETHER THERE WOULD

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:20.646
BE.

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:23.582
REVENUE AVAILABLE FOR THE YOUTH

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:25.717
ACCOUNT --

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.753
IS THERE THERE WOULD BE AS AS

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:28.720
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTED

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:29.688
BY THING THAT'LL DEPEND

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.790
CRUCIALLY ON SHOULD THE NEXT

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:33.825
COUPLE OF OF REVENUE UPDATES --

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:35.360
WHETHER THERE WILL BE REVENUE

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:36.762
AVAILABLE FOR THE ACCOUNT AND IF

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:38.430
SO HOW MUCH.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:39.931
I THINK TO HELP ILLUSTRATE THIS

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:41.533
A LITTLE BIT BETTER --

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.634
TO IF YOU LOOK.

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:44.336
WE HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION

00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:45.470
DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND LOANS

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:47.072
THAT NEED TO BE REPAID WE HAVE

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.306
ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT MILLION

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:49.074
DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.542
ALLOCATIONS FROM ALLOCATION ONE

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.744
INTO THAT NEED TO BE PAID.

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:53.679
NINETEEN NINETEEN WE'VE RCEIVED

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:54.813
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.481
DOLLARS TO DATE WHICH DOESN'T

00:21:56.548 --> 00:21:57.983
INCLUDE THIS TAX PAYMENT THAT

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.184
WE'RE ABOUT TO RECEIVE.

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:00.752
SO IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THIS

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.421
NEXT TAX PAYMENT WILL LIKELY

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:04.156
COVER THE ALLOCATION ONE INTO

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:06.491
COSTS AND WILL START TO BEGIN TO

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:06.925
SEE.

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.293
RAINY REALLOCATION AND MISTER

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.662
CHAIRMAN JUST REACT TO THAT

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:11.563
QUICKLY --

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.165
THIS CONSTRUCTION IS INTERESTING

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:17.202
BECAUSE THIS CATEGORY.

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:19.337
THREE REQUIRES FILLING THE FIRST

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:20.906
TWO BUCKETS FIRST AND SO IN

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:22.741
TERMS OF PREDICTING WHAT YOU

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:25.944
HAVE. TO DO ADVANCE PLANNING ON

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:29.014
PREVENTION OR TREATMENT PROGRAMS --

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:31.416
IT'S REALLY KIND OF AN IMPERFECT

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:32.350
STRUCTURE.

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:34.019
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW FOR BEING

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.620
ABLE TO DO.

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:37.856
SOUND INVESTMENT PLANNING WHEN

00:22:37.923 --> 00:22:40.559
YOU'RE WAITING EACH YEAR TO SEEN.

00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:42.294
QUITE WHAT MIGHT SPILL OVER INTO

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.962
THAT CATEGORY THREE I KNOW THIS

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:46.431
ISN'T YOUR CREATION.

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:48.934
YOU ARE BOUND TO TRY TO FIGURE

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.569
OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT WITH US

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:54.940
BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IDEAS.

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:56.508
MAYBE AT SOME OF THE RESEARCH

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:58.243
THAT GOES ON WITH SOME OF THIS

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.411
MONEY BUT HOW DO WE GET BETTER

00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:00.645
PROJECTING.

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:03.482
ANTICIPATED TAX REVENUES SO THAT

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:04.850
THERE COULD POTENTIALLY BE

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:06.351
COMMITMENTS ARE ADVANCE LOANS

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:08.420
MADE FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO TO

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:11.456
MAKE SURE WE WE ARE FULLY.

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:13.692
PROMOTING THE EDUCATION

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:15.060
PREVENTION AND REATMENT

00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:16.661
PROGRAMS AND NOT.

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:18.063
HOLDING IMPLEMENTATION IN

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.232
ABEYANCE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SURE

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:21.233
WHAT WE'RE GONNA GET SO I KNOW

00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:22.768
IF THERE'S A PRESIDENT FOR THAT

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:26.838
KIND OF LOAN AND ON SOME AMOUNT

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:27.806
KNOWING THAT.

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:29.007
YOU'LL GET SOMETHING THERE BUT

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:30.475
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT IT

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:31.777
IS -- THAT

00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:33.411
WOULD ALLOW.

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:34.646
FOR PLANNERS AND IMPLEMENTERS TO

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:36.982
MOVE FORWARD SO.

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:39.985
JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT.

00:23:40.051 --> 00:23:42.487
YEAH I POINTS WELL TAKEN --

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:43.688
ANYTHING COURSE STILL SORT OF

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.123
WORKING THROUGH THOSE DETAILS I

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.125
DO THINK THAT AT LEAST THREE

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:48.860
QUARTERS OF THE PRIOR YEAR'S TAX

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:50.562
PAYMENTS WILLBE IN BEFORE THE

00:23:50.629 --> 00:23:52.430
END OF THE FISCAL YEAR.

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:54.132
SO WE'LL HAVE ONE TAX PAYMENT

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:55.901
THAT TAKES PLACE AFTER --

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:57.402
AND I THINK AS THE MARKET

00:23:57.469 --> 00:23:59.805
MATURES I'M ASSUMING THE BE MORE

00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:03.275
STABILITY IN THOSE PROJECTIONS --

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:04.876
BUT IT UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT'S A

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:06.411
CHALLENGE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:09.381
WILL HAVE --

00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:12.617
TO UNDERTAKE.

00:24:12.684 --> 00:24:14.252
YES ASSN RUBIO THANK YOU.

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:15.020
FORGIVE ME FIGHT AND SEE IT AND

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:16.121
SOME OF THE PAPERWORK THAT YOU

00:24:16.188 --> 00:24:17.322
PROVIDE IT BUT I'M JUST A LITTLE

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:18.256
CURIOUS I KNOW IT'S AND YOU

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:19.524
INDUSTRY AND THERE'S A LOT OF

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:20.625
UNKNOWNS.

00:24:20.692 --> 00:24:22.360
I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW WE ARE

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:24.396
GOING TO RECRUIT MORE PEOPLE TO

00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:25.463
GO INTO THESE PROFESSIONS IN

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.201
TERMS OF THE THE MENTAL HEALTH --

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:29.801
WELLNESS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:32.637
I'M JUST ONE SIR CAN WE USE

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:33.705
FUNDING FOR LIKE LOAN

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:34.940
FORGIVENESS.

00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:36.408
PROGRAMS TO GOING TO THESE

00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:38.577
FIELDS I CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

00:24:38.643 --> 00:24:40.579
THE PROBLEM I GONNA GET BIGGER

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:42.480
AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE THE USE

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:44.082
OF CANNABIS AT A MORE AND MORE

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.150
IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND I

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:47.018
HAVE TO TELL YOU PERSON I COME

00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:48.386
FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE WE

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.255
WE DID GET ABOUT FIFTEEN PERMITS

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:52.390
AND WE ARE STARTING TO SEE --

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:54.192
SOME OF THE UNANTICIPATED

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:55.994
CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE PERMITS

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:57.028
AND SO.

00:24:57.095 --> 00:24:58.230
WE'RE TRYING TO SEE A LOT MORE

00:24:58.296 --> 00:25:00.432
USE OF CANNABIS OUT IN THE OPEN

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:05.003
AND KIDS FALLING PREY. TO TO THE

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.872
USE OF CANNABIS A PERHAPS IS NOT

00:25:06.938 --> 00:25:08.206
TO A QUALITY I DON'T KNOW VERY

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:09.441
MUCH ABOUT CANNABIS BED.

00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:10.575
SO MY POINT IS I THINK WE'RE

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:11.476
GONNA NEED A LOT MORE

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:12.878
PROFESSIONALS IN THIS INDUSTRY

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:14.112
HOW TO WEEK.

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.381
PROMOTED HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:18.183
THEM AND DOT CAN WE USE SOME OF

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.417
THAT FUNDING FOR LOAN

00:25:19.484 --> 00:25:21.186
FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS FOR THEM TO

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:22.821
GO INTO THE FIELD.

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:26.424
AND BECOME EXPERTS IN THIS ARENA.

00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:28.460
YES WE AGREE THAT THERE IS --

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:31.096
SOME UNMET NEEDS IN THIS AREA WE

00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:33.198
DON'T HAVE NUMBERS ON HOW MANY

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:34.699
NEW PROFESSIONALS WE WOULD NEED

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:36.434
TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS BUT

00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:38.270
THE TYPES OF PROFESSIONALS THAT

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:39.938
WILL BE NEEDED CAN RANGE FROM.

00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:41.039
YOU KNOW PRIVATE TRAINING FOR

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:43.375
PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO

SCHOOL COUNSELORS TO NURSES TO

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:49.080
EVEN SUPPORT SPECIALIST.

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:50.382
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE

00:25:50.448 --> 00:25:52.217
RECOMMEND THAT THE THE

00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:53.551
LEGISLATURE --

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:55.320
WORK WITH THE THREE DEPARTMENTS

TO DEVELOP SERVICE STATEWIDE

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.857
STRATEGY TO INCREASE --

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:00.825
TRAINING AND WORK FORCE IN THIS

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:01.993
AREA.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.729
AND THAT COULD CERTAINLY INCLUDE --

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:07.699
LOAN FORGIVENESS OR SOME.

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:09.000
AND THAT MIGHT BE WERE THE

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:10.602
LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY HELP THE

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:12.537
THREE DEPARTMENTS IN IN ACTING

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.739
STATUTETHAT FACILITATES THAT

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:15.040
[inaudible]

00:26:15.106 --> 00:26:19.277
THANK.

00:26:19.344 --> 00:26:22.080
QUESTIONS OKAY SIDE AND IF

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:23.114
COUPLE QUESTIONS IN A FOLLOW UP

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:24.316
AND SO DID TECHNICAL ADVISORY

00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:26.685
COMMITTEE YOU MAY NOTE THAT --

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:28.787
YOU KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT

00:26:28.853 --> 00:26:29.688
OF DIFFERENT.

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:30.655
THAT DESERVE PERMISSION WE COULD

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:32.190
USE SOME HELP WITH WHAT WOULD

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.625
YOU SEE THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY

00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:36.261
COMMITTEE RESIDING YOU TALK

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:36.928
ABOUT.

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:38.797
ITS RESULTING LEGISLATORS

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:40.165
OVERSIZE AT THE PART OF THE

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:42.734
LEGISLATURE PART ADMINISTRATION

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:43.835
WERE WORRIES.

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:45.570
BUT FENNELL AS PERSPECTIVE --

00:26:45.637 --> 00:26:47.639
WHERE WOULD YOU SEE THE --

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:48.974
THE BETTER THE AT THIS TECHNICAL

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.243
VISOR COMMITTEE BEST BEING

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.612
SITUATED.

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:55.213
YEAH I KNOW THAT SIR THAT'S A

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.581
REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I

00:26:56.648 --> 00:26:57.415
THINK THAT --

00:26:57.482 --> 00:26:57.983
FOR SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.417
DETAILS IF IT'S AN ISSUE THAT

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:01.252
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:02.787
PURSUE WE WOULD BE HAPPY.

00:27:02.854 --> 00:27:04.222
TO WORK WITH YOU TO EXPLORE THE

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:05.623
THE VARIOUS OPTIONS BUT WE

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.359
REALLY SAW THIS AS A COMMITTEE

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:09.094
THAT COULD.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.395
REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:12.664
LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO HELP --

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:13.832
DEPARTMENTS WITH TECHNICAL

00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:15.967
ASSISTANCE SO.

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:17.802
HAVEN'T QUITE WORKED OUT HOW

00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:19.537
THOSE DETAILS AND WOULDN'T DO

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:21.373
YOU EVER OF TECHNICAL ADVISORY

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:23.675
COMMITTEES ARE PART OF THE LA L..

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:25.577
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A HIS YOU

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:28.513
ARE OUR ADVISORS AND MANY OF

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.749
THESE ALL WILL.

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:32.650
BUT ONE MASSIVE ADVISORY

00:27:32.717 --> 00:27:35.987
COMMITTEE YES.

00:27:36.054 --> 00:27:37.722
THINK ABOUT IT IS I I JUST FEEL

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:38.456
WORK -- AND

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:39.090
THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.258
FOR FINANCES IS THAT --

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:42.861
SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE DON'T

00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:45.030
ALWAYS KNOW IT SO THAT'S OF

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:48.533
BASICALLY YOU AND SILENCE A WELL

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.702
WE HAVE X. NUMBER DOLLARS.

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:51.903
IN THIS ACCOUNT WE DO THIS

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.071
ANNUALLY ANY.

00:27:53.138 --> 00:27:54.873
AND AND SAY THAT NOW WE HAVE

00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:56.408
THIS MUCH MONEY FOR PART THREE

00:27:56.474 --> 00:27:58.009
FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR WHEN WE

00:27:58.076 --> 00:27:59.844
FIND OUT DID MAKE THAT

00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:01.179
DETERMINATION WE HAVE.

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:02.447
EX NUMBER OF DOLLARS FOR FOR

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:05.216
THIS FUND.

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:06.451
THAT IS SO THAT'S A GOOD

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:07.852
QUESTION I DON'T THINK A KNOW

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.154
WITH PRECISION THE ANSWER TO

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.355
THAT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:11.790
ALLOCATED MONEY TO THIS THIRD

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.625
ALLOCATION YET BUT WE DO.

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:14.325
SO --

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:15.960
PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR REQUIRES

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.662
THAT WE SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:19.197
CONTROLLER BY JUNE FIFTEENTH.

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:21.766
IN IN THERE WE SORT OF DELINEATE --

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:23.435
ALLOCATION ONE WHAT DEPARTMENTS

00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:24.936
GET WHAT AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE

00:28:25.003 --> 00:28:26.237
THAT'S NOT SPECIFIED THEN WE

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:27.939
PROVIDE THE ALLOCATION TO

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:29.607
CONSISTENT WITH THE INITIATIVE.

00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:30.975
AND THEN I ENVISION THAT WE

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:32.677
WOULD JUST SAY ALLOCATION THREE

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:33.945
WOULD SAY WHATEVER'S REMAINING

00:28:34.012 --> 00:28:35.613
GOES IN THIS PERCENTAGE FORM TO

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.948
THESE DEPARTMENTS.

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:38.216
AND IT WOULDN'T BE UNTIL WE GOT

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:39.584
THAT FINAL TAX PAYMENT AT THE

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:40.819
END OF THE JOE I THAT THEY WOULD

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:42.587
ACTUALLY KNOW IN TOTAL WHAT THEY

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:44.489
HAVE IN A GIVEN YEAR TO SPEND

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:45.757
OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY THINKING

00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:47.125
ABOUT OUR BUDGETING PROCESS WE

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:49.327
DO OUR GENERAL FUND BUDGET YOU.

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.296
KNOW HOPEFULLY SIGNED BY THE

00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:52.464
GOVERNOR'S FISCAL YEAR STARTS

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.300
JULY FIRST BUT IN TERMS OF THIS

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:56.334
FUND.

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:56.868
THERE'S A LETTER ON JUNE

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:58.136
FIFTEENTH FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL

00:28:58.203 --> 00:29:00.905
YEAR RIGHT. FOR THE NEXT FOR THE

00:29:00.972 --> 00:29:02.974
COMING FISCAL YEAR THE COMING

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:03.541
FOR NINETEEN TWENTY BUT IT'S

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.476
BASED ON THE IDEA OF WHAT WAS

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:06.811
SPENT IN EIGHTY NINE OKAY AND

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.980
WHAT WAS RECEIVED AN H. OKAY.

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:11.082
SO THE IDEA OF GOD SORRY BUT IN

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.983
TERMS OF DETERMINING HOW MUCH

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.552
MONEY WILL FINALLY LAND IN THE

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:15.453
SPOT.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.822
THAT THE PROP THREE I GUESS --

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:19.090
DIRECTLY --

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:21.359
YOU WE WOULD KNOW THE FINAL

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:22.794
TAXIS IS AND OF JULY SO WE WOULD

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:24.362
NOT ACTUALLY KNOW FOR THIS FINE

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:27.065
HOW MUCH MONEY EITHER IS MOVING

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:29.000
FORWARD UNTIL.

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:30.502
TARGET SOMETHING --

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:32.670
RIGHT YES AND AND SO THIS ISN'T

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:35.673
A BUDGET ACT SO THEY WOULD GO IN

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.342
THERE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:38.710
SO THAT AND LETTER IN THE FACT.

00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:40.645
IS SORT OF OUR BUDGET MECHANISM

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.180
TO PROVIDE THE DOLLARS TO THE

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:43.648
DEPARTMENT'S SO IT DOESN'T IT

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:44.782
DOESN'T LINE UP PERFECTLY I

00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:45.850
GUESS WITH OUR BUDGET ACT

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:47.919
PROCESS OF IN THEY WOULDN'T KNOW

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:49.587
UNTIL ABOUT AUGUST OKAY.

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:50.655
BECAUSE PART OF WHAT I'M ALSO

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:52.157
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TIMELINE

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:53.091
WISE --

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.726
MAYBE QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:55.827
IS -- HOW

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:57.428
THE LEGISLATURE EXERCISES

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.297
OVERSIGHT OVER?

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:01.733
THE SPENDING OF THE SON OF THESE

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:02.867
FUNDS RIGHT BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:05.036
KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THERE IS SO

00:30:05.103 --> 00:30:07.305
NOW THE MONEY SHOWS UP WE NOW

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:08.206
HAVE A SOME SOME.

00:30:08.273 --> 00:30:09.674
IN AUGUST.

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:12.076
AND DANDER NEEDS TO BE A PROCESS

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:14.145
TO I GUESS.

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:15.480
SPEND IT AND HOW DOES IT ACT

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:17.215
LEGISLATURE EXERCISE OVERSIGHT

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:19.617
ABOUT HOW IT'S SPENT.

00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:21.052
SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:22.554
THROUGH AN FIGURE OUT THOSE

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.355
DETAILS I'M AT THE NAY REVISION

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:25.823
ON THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.659
SHARE THEIR ALLOCATION THREE

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:28.893
PLAN AT THAT TIME.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.995
THAT'S NOT DISSIMILAR HOW WE DID

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:32.730
IT LAST YEAR TO JUST ALLOCATION

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:34.732
THREE PROGRAMS WERE AVAILABLE

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.334
FOR EXPENDITURE IN --

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:37.702
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND SO WE'RE

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.003
WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH ON

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.904
SORT OF HOW THAT INDEED WILL

00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:41.573
HAPPEN I THINK IT'S HAPPENED IN

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:43.074
THE NORMAL SUBCOMMITTEE ROCESS.

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:44.642
BUT IN EFFECT YES WHAT IT

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:45.977
WHATEVER GOES INTO THAT LETTER

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:47.111
ON JUNE FIFTEENTH SORT OF

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.846
SOLIDIFIES WHAT THE PLAN IS

00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:49.547
MOVING FORWARD.

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:51.649
AND AT THAT TIME I THINK WE'VE

00:30:51.716 --> 00:30:54.552
HAD A GOOD IN YOUR MAYBE THE

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:56.788
PRECISE DOLLAR AMOUNTS.

00:30:56.854 --> 00:30:58.089
AND I THINK A CERTAIN THE LA --

00:30:58.156 --> 00:30:59.123
OPINIONS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.592
EXERCISE OVERSIGHT GIVEN THE

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.293
NATURE OF THE TIMING OF THE

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.798
FUNDS AN YEAH THE CENTER PAN

00:31:06.864 --> 00:31:08.733
MARTIN LA OKAY.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.667
I THINK A KEY THE KEY POINT TO

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:10.768
RECOGNIZE IS THE THE CONTINUOUS

00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:11.936
APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY OF

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.204
THESE FUNDS SO.

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:14.372
SO WELL THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:17.809
HAVE ITS TYPICAL BUDGET --

00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:20.011
APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY THAT

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:21.412
OVER SO I CAN BE EXERCISED IN

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:22.914
MANY DIFFERENT CONTACTS SO

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:24.649
REALLY THIS PROPS WHILE THE

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:25.250
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE COULD BE

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:26.718
INVOLVED --

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:28.453
THIS IS --

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:31.155
PROPS MORE IN IN LINE WITH THE

00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:32.757
THE POLICY COMMITTEE FUNCTION

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:34.592
AND OVERSEEN THROUGH THAT AND

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:38.529
AND AND AGAIN OVERSIGHT CAN COME.

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:40.798
FIRST AND FOREMOST FROM SETTINGS

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.000
SORT OF IN STATUTES SORT OF

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:43.468
PARAMETERS FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:45.169
FOR PREFERENCES AND DIRECTION

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.939
AND THEN HAVING ONGOING SERVE

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:48.973
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS INFORMATIONAL

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.009
HEARINGS IN TERMS OF HOW WELL

00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:55.647
THE DEMONSTRATION IS LIVING UP

00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:57.548
TO THOSE SET THOSE GOALS ACTED

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:59.550
WITH THE THE BUDGET.

00:31:59.617 --> 00:32:01.452
TIMELINE AND THEN ONE OTHER

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.787
QUESTION FOR FINANCE SAID SAYS --

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:04.522
WE'RE ANTICIPATING WE DON'T KNOW

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:05.990

FOR WHAT THE MECHANISMS --

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:41.225

JUST HAD.

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:44.362
INITIAL DISCUSSIONS I MEAN THAT

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:45.563
THE MOST THESE DEPARTMENTS HAVE

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:46.898
BEEN AWARE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.533
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:50.501

SURPRISED BY THAT BUT SO WE HAVE

00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:55.039
BEGAN SOME INITIAL DISCUSSIONS

00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:56.741
WITH THE AFFECTED DEPARTMENTS

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:57.608

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:58.976
THAT INTO OUR SPRING BUDGET

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:00.678
DELIBERATION PROCESS.

00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:01.779
ENVISIONING THAT WE WOULD HAVE A

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:03.147
MAJOR REVISION PROPOSAL FOR THE

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:04.649

FROM THE AGENCIES --

00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:10.355
LATER ON SO I I ANTICIPATE BASED

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:12.023
ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID THAT THEY

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.191

00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:14.025
OF RABIES SHARING WITH US THE

00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:16.961
WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING TO

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:19.063
FIGURE OUT THIS OUT.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.465
AND I THINK THEIR THERE REALLY

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:22.400
IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT AS I

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:23.601
STATED I THINK THE MAY REVISION

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:24.669
PROPOSAL WILL ACTUALLY SOLIDIFY

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:26.204
THOSE DETAILS AND WE OULD WANT

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.201
MY REMARKS TODAY ARE ABOUT WHY

00:39:30.267 --> 00:39:32.069
IT'S CRITICAL TO FUND PREVENTION

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:33.537
VIA THE YOUTH ACCOUNT WITH THE

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:36.207
SPECIFIC GOALS OF ADVANCING

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.742
HEALTH AND RACIAL EQUITY.

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:39.477
THERE'S AN OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:40.878
THAT WHERE WE LIVE ARE

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:42.546
SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENTS ARE THE

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:44.181
MOST SIGNIFICANT SHAPERS OF

00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:45.349
HEALTH AND WELL BEING BECAUSE

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:47.852
THEY DETERMINE OUR OPPORTUNITIES.

00:39:47.918 --> 00:39:49.854
WHAT WE ARE EXPOSED TO AND WHAT

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.323
WE CONSIDER NORMAL OR EXPECTED

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:53.958
PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR?

00:39:54.024 --> 00:39:55.526
INVESTING IN PREVENTION AT THE

00:39:55.593 --> 00:39:57.328
COMMUNITY LEVEL IS HOW WE CAN

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:58.829
SHIFT THOSE FORCES IN THE

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.198
ENVIRONMENT TO MAKE HEALTHY AND

00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:02.800
SAFE BEHAVIOR IS THE NORM.

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.535
WILL ALSO PROMOTING HEALING AND

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:06.570
RESILIENCE AMONG YOUTH WHO HAVE

00:40:06.637 --> 00:40:09.173
BEEN EXPERIENCING TRAUMA AND MAY

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.641
BE AT RISK OF SUBSTANCE USE.

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:12.643
PREVENTION SPECIFICALLY PRIMARY

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.812
PREVENTION IS DEFINED AS

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:15.946
COMMUNITY LEVEL EFFORTS THAT

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:17.481
PROMOTE HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS AND

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:19.917
BEHAVIOR TO PREVENT INJURY BILL.

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:21.352
ILLNESS AND INJURY FROM

00:40:21.418 --> 00:40:22.987
OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:23.988
AND WHEN WE APPLY THIS TO

00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:26.223
SUBSTANCE USE FUNDING PREVENTION

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.826
MEANS PREVENTING EXPOSURE TO AND

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:30.494
USE OF SUBSTANCES AND IT'S

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:31.996
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SAME

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:33.731
STRATEGIES THAT PREVENT INITIAL

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:34.532
USE.

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:36.634
ARE ALSO CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.302
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN TREATMENT AND

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:40.137
RECOVERY IN SHORT EVERYONE

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:42.306
BENEFITS WHEN ENVIRONMENT

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:44.141
SUPPORT HEALTH AND SAFETY.

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:45.242
WHEN FUNDING PREVENTION THERE'S

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:47.611
SOME CORE ELEMENTS OF A

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:49.246
SUCCESSFUL INITIATIVES AND

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.815
PROGRAMS TO KEEP IN MIND?

00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:52.216
FIRST WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:54.018
COMMUNITY LEVEL DETERMINANTS OF

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:55.686
HEALTH SO THOSE ARE FACTORS IN

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:57.054
THE ENVIRONMENT THAT STRONGLY

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.189
INFLUENCE HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND

00:40:58.255 --> 00:40:59.323
OUTCOMES.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.391
AND THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF

00:41:00.457 --> 00:41:03.027
YOU FLED AFTER COMMUNITY

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.195
ENVIRONMENTS.

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:05.930
A DESIRE FOR SAFE ACCESS TO

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:07.798
PARKS AND OPEN SPACE FOR EXAMPLE

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:09.767
HAS LED SOME COMMUNITIES TO

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:12.102
FOCUS ON REVITALIZATION OF PARKS.

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:13.404
INCLUDING YOUTH DEVELOPED

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.372
PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE ACCESSED AT

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:17.374
PARKS AFTER SCHOOL AND AFTER

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:18.075
DARK.

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:20.344
PROMOTING SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.012
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.547
OTHER COMMUNITIES YOU'D HAVE

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.015
ORGANIZED TO AFFECT CHANGE

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:27.218
AROUND WHAT IS SOLD AND PROMOTED

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:28.552
WEIGHING IN ON ZONING

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:30.754
REGULATIONS AND OTHER POLICIES

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:32.056
TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTHY

00:41:32.122 --> 00:41:32.990
FOOD.

00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:34.525
AND LIMIT THE REACH OF TOBACCO

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:36.927
AND ALCOHOL MARKETING ALONG WITH

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.495
OTHER PREDATORY BUSINESSES.

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:39.797
THESE APPROACHES CAN FOSTER A

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:43.033
SENSE OF PURPOSE AND BELONGING

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.235
FOR YOUTH IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.769
THE SECOND ELEMENT IS THAT WE

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.271
MUST ELEVATE YOUTH LEADERSHIP

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:48.806
SET WITHIN THE YOUTH FIND WE CAN

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:51.108
SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE GATHERING

SERVING AS LEADERS AND DEFINING

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.080

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:56.981
EFFORTS.

00:41:57.047 --> 00:41:58.282
DEVELOPING THESE LEADERSHIP

00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.783
SKILLS AND CAPACITIES HAS BEEN

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.418
SHOWN TO PROTECT AGAINST HIGH

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:02.820
RISK BEHAVIORS.

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:04.788
AND THIRD EQUITY AND JUSTICE

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:06.223
NEED TO BE EMBEDDED INTO THE

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.558
PROGRAM.

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:08.792

00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:14.131
BE DESIGNED EQUITABLY WITH DEEP

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:15.900
INVESTMENTS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:17.468
THAT HAVE BEEN MOST TARGETED BY

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:18.769
THE WAR ON DRUGS.

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:20.237
A SET OF POLICY DECISIONS

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:21.772
DESIGNED TO SYSTEMATICALLY

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.974
CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE AND

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.209
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:26.510
OUR INVESTMENTS TODAY CAN BE AN

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:28.245
IMPORTANT STEP IN KNOWLEDGE IN

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:33.370
THAT CONTRIBUTE TO YOUNG PEOPLE

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:35.105
GROWING UP TO EITHER STRUGGLE.

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:37.174
OR TO THRIVE.

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:38.642
AND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS WILL

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:40.010
RELY ON EVIDENCE BASED

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:41.845
STRATEGIES RATHER THAN JUST

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:42.846
CURRICULUMS.

00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:44.181
AND HAVE NOT YET MET A YOUNG

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:46.216
PERSON WHOSE LIFE HAS BEEN

00:44:46.283 --> 00:44:47.718
CHANGED BY CURRICULA.

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:49.853
IS BEEN CHANGED BY THE PEOPLE

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.155
THAT THEY CAN ACT WITHIN THOSE

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:53.791
PROGRAMS AND THE ENVIRONMENT

00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:56.026
THAT WE CREATE AROUND THEM.

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:57.461
THE FRIEND I LIE PROGRAM FOLLOWS

00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:00.264
A SET OF STANDARDS OF PRACTICE.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.433
THINGS THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED

00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:04.668
AND TO THOSE STANDARDS ARE SAFE

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:06.303
ENVIRONMENT BOTH PHYSICALLY AND

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:07.671
EMOTIONALLY.

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.740
AND CARING RELATIONSHIPS.

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:10.941
AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:12.443
HAVE WHEN WE HAVE NEW RESOURCES

00:45:12.509 --> 00:45:13.844
IS THE URGE TO CREATE LOTS OF

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:15.512
NEW PROGRAMS.

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:16.814
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WE

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.048
BUILD UPON THE EXISTING

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:20.317
INFRASTRUCTURE OF PROGRAMS.

00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:22.052
THAT ARE CONTINUOUSLY LOOKING TO

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:23.120
IMPROVE.

00:45:23.187 --> 00:45:24.955
AND INVEST IN THEM TO EXPAND

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:27.057
THEIR CAPACITY.

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:28.425
WE WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON WAYS

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:31.261
TO ENGAGE YOUTH IN POSITIVE WAYS.

00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:33.530
WHERE THEY BECOME PARTNERS IN

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:35.332
THE DESIGN OF THOSE PROGRAMS?

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.500
AND THAT THEY'RE HELPING CREATE

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:37.468
THE SOLUTIONS IN THEIR

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:39.236
COMMUNITIES.

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:41.705
WE FAIL MOST WHEN WE ATTEMPTED

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:43.440
TO APPLY ADULT MODELS TO YOUTH

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:46.710
ISSUES.

00:45:46.777 --> 00:45:48.979
OUR BEST PROGRAMS ARE THOSE

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:49.980
PROGRAMS WHERE WE HAVE USED

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:51.248
VOICE IN THE DESIGN AND

00:45:51.315 --> 00:45:52.382
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:54.118
AND IN THOSE PROGRAMS WE FIND

00:45:54.184 --> 00:45:55.519
YOUTH THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:56.587
ENGAGED.

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:57.888
AND HAVE SKILLS TO IMPROVE THE

00:45:57.955 --> 00:45:59.223
HEALTH AND WELLNESS IN THEIR

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:00.757

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:09.633
WHEN PERFORMANCE SUFFERS.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.568

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:21.845
AND THE CONTINUE ON THAT WE LOOK

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.814

I PARTICIPATED IN THE PROP SIXTY

FOUR STAKEHOLDER GROUP WHICH IS

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:36.493
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF COLLABORATION.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.395
AND COLLABORATION OFTTIMES IS AN

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:39.997
UNNATURAL ACT BETWEEN UNWILLING

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:41.431

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:43.967
BUT YOU HAVE THE CONSENSUS

AGREEMENT IN YOUR PACKET.

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:47.905

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:50.541
WHERE WE'RE EMBARKING ON A

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:52.176
JOURNEY TO PROVIDE INPUT.

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:54.378
ON A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES THAT

APPROPRIATELY MEET YOUTH NEEDS

00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:58.315
AND AGAIN MAKING SURE WE DON'T

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.217
PUT YOUTH INTO ADULT MODELS OF

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:00.984
CARE.

00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:02.486
AND THAT WERE ASSURING THAT WE

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:04.021
HAVE YOUTH VOICE IN THOSE

00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:05.355

TWENTY ONE IS OKAY.

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:13.030
BUT WE'VE ALSO WISELY DECIDED

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:15.265
THAT THERE IS A RESOURCE

00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:17.000
AVAILABLE TO REDUCE THAT HARM

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:19.603
BECAUSE INCREASED AVAILABILITY.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.738
AND NORMALIZATION WILL CREATE

00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:23.807
HARPER.

00:47:23.874 --> 00:47:25.375
AN EXAMPLE THAT NORMALIZATION IS

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:26.710
ALREADY HOW WE USE THE TERM

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:27.678
CANNABIS.

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:29.880
INSTEAD OF MARIJUANA.

ANYONE RECEIVING PUBLIC FUNDS TO

MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:40.591
SOMETIMES WHAT WE MEASURE

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.426
DOESN'T MATTER.

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:43.360
AND SOMETIMES WHAT MATTERS CAN'T

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:15.238
MARJORIE --

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:16.573
AND THEN THE SECOND.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.042
ONE IS THE FUNDING MECHANISM AND

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:22.212
THIS IS GOING BACK AWAY ISMS ON

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:23.046
BEAR WITH ME THE FUNDING

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:25.515
MECHANISM THAT WE CREATED A PROP

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:26.149
THIRTY SIX BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:29.986
AND ONE THAT ALLOCATED FUNDING --

00:51:30.053 --> 00:51:31.455
TO TO THE COUNTIES --

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:33.657
WAS IN AGREEMENT WITH EVERYBODY

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:35.325
TOOK QUITE AWHILE TO COME UP

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:37.160
WITH THAT SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL --

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:38.995
BUT THAT IS A POSITIVE FUNDING

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:40.130
MECHANISM TO DRIVE THE FUNDS

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:43.033
DOWN TO THE COMMUNE TOWN THE

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:46.436
COUNTIES AS WELL --

00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:47.170
THE THIRD.

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:50.106
THIRD RECOMMENDATION I HAVE IS --

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:50.841
WHEN YOU LOOK TO CREATE NEW

00:51:50.907 --> 00:51:54.978
FACILITIES BECAUSE WE HAVE NO

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:55.679
NOW?

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:56.713
LOOK AT THE MODEL THAT WAS

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.315
DEVELOPED BY DEPARTMENT HOUSING

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.584
AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.152
PROPOSITION.

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:02.953
FORTY SIX WHICH CREATED

00:52:03.019 --> 00:52:04.721
INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.556
STATE FOR HOMELESSNESS.

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:08.391
THIS FUNDING MODEL COULD BE

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:10.126
EASILY MODEL TO BUILD ALL THE

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:12.195
MODALITIES OF FACILITIES NEEDED

00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:13.430
FOR ADOLESCENT CARE IN

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.332
CALIFORNIA.

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:18.101
AND LASTLY --

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:20.604
INSURE YOU KNOW AS A PROVIDER

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.339
AND AND AS AN EMPLOYER.

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.774
ENSURE THAT A LARGE EMPHASIS IS

00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:26.076
PLACED ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:29.713
AN ISSUE DO YOU PROFESSIONALS.

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:31.381
I I THINK I HEARD IT MENTIONED

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:32.616
ONCE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:33.817
FINANCE FOLKS.

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:34.951
ESPECIALLY THOSE SPECIALIZING IN

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:37.153
ADOLESCENT FAMILY COUNSELING.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.489
MARCH PET DETERMINED IN TWO

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:40.090
THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT THE ISSUE

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:41.858
DO YOU WORK FORCE WAS DISTRESSED

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:43.193
AND NEEDED TO INCREASE

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.896
DRAMATICALLY TO MEET THE ADULT

00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:48.598
NEED. SEVEN YEARS AGO.

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:50.233
OUR WORK FORCE REMAINS SERIOUSLY

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.801
DISTRESSED AND COULD NOT MEET

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.169
THE NEEDS CITIES ADDITIONAL

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:53.703
SERVICES WILL CREATE

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:54.004
[inaudible]

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.873
THANK YOU.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.041
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR

00:52:58.108 --> 00:52:59.442
PRESENTATIONS --

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:05.715
QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS.

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:10.220
COUPLE QUESTIONS MISS SIMMS I'D

LIKE TO START WITH YOU IF THAT'S

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.222
OKAY.

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:13.990
YOU TALKED ABOUT EQUITY --

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:15.091
WHICH I THINK IS INCREDIBLY

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:16.226
IMPORTANT.

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:18.428
MY MY QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:20.497
YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS BE FOR HOW

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.465
THE YOUTH EDUCATION ACCOUNT I'M

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:24.067
TO SHORTEN THAT A LITTLE BIT

00:53:24.134 --> 00:53:25.435
SINCE IT'S KIND OF LONG --

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:27.404
CAN ACTUALLY STRIVE FOR RACIAL

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.606
AND ETHNIC AND SOCIAL ECONOMIC

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:31.841
EQUITY HOW COULD WE ACTUALLY

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:35.178
ACCOMPLISH THAT.

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:35.879
THANK YOU I'M.

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.080
SO.

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.114
INITIALLY I MEAN I THINK IT'S

00:53:38.181 --> 00:53:39.215
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:40.483
THAT WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE GOING

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.619
CELL THINKING ABOUT WHICH

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:43.987
COMMUNITIES HAVE BANNED.

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:46.089
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY

00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:49.359
THE WAR ON DRUGS ON WILL BE AN

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:50.760
IMPORTANT PIECE --

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:51.394
AND DEVELOPING A METHODOLOGY FOR

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:55.665
DOING IT WILL BE IMPORTANT --

00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:57.968
AND THEN ANOTHER ELEMENT OF IT

00:53:58.034 --> 00:53:59.703
REALLY NEEDS TO BE ABOUT

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:00.904
THINKING ABOUT WHO THE MONEY

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:02.405
GOES TO AND WHAT IT'S USED FOR

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:03.173
SO.

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:05.241
I THINK IT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:07.344
REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.979
INCENTIVIZE --

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:11.815
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LED BY

00:54:11.881 --> 00:54:13.717
PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW OUR LEVINE

00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:15.118
AND A PART OF THE COMMUNITIES IN

00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:16.386
WHICH THEY WORK.

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:18.154
ALSO LED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF

00:54:18.221 --> 00:54:20.423
COLOR I THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.391
AS WELL.

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:24.260
AND ADDITIONALLY REALLY LOOKING

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:26.262
AT KIND OF A ASSETS BASED

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:28.398
APPROACH TO THE KINDS OF

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:29.265
INVESTMENTS.

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:31.901
I THINK YOU KNOW SERVICES ARE AN

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:33.970
IMPORTANT PIECE OF TREATMENT --

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:37.407
AND LOOKING AT INVESTMENTS THAT

00:54:37.474 --> 00:54:40.343
CAN REALLY INVEST IN COMMUNITY

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:41.811
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.413
AND THE VERY PLACES AND

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.149
OPPORTUNITIES THAT KIDS NEED.

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:48.318
TO HAVE ACTIVITIES AND TO BUILD

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:49.552
SKILLS --

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.488
THOSE WILL BE IMPORTANT

00:54:51.554 --> 00:54:53.323
COMPONENTS OF DESIGNING AN

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.358
EQUITY FOCUS PROGRAM RATHER THAN

00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:57.060
ONE THAT'S MORE DOWNSTREAM AND

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:58.862
LOOKING AT TREATMENT AFTER THE

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:01.164
FACT.

00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:03.466
THANK YOU THOSE VERY HELPFUL --

00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:04.234
DOCTOR COOLER.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.301
CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOUR FIVE HARD

00:55:05.368 --> 00:55:10.073
EVIDENCE BASED DRUG PREVENTION.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.141
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:13.376
FOCUS ON A SET OF STANDARDS OF

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:14.711
PRACTICE WHICH ARE.

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.379
STEEPED IN YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:17.781
PRINCIPLES THE FIRST OF THOSE IS

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:20.050
MAKING SURE THAT ANY CONTACT

00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:21.317
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:23.853
PROVIDES A SAFE ENVIRONMENT BOTH

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.321
PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY.

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.623
THAT WE ALSO THAT AND TAKE A

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.091
LOOK AT DOING SKILL BUILDING

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:29.526
WITH THEM SO THAT THEY ARE

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:30.193
REALLY.

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.995
NOT JUST PARTICIPATING BUT

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.329
THEY'RE GAINING SOMETHING BY

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.098
THEIR PARTICIPATION.

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:36.800
WE ALSO THEN TAKE A LOOK AT

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:37.333
THEIR CONNECTED TO THEIR

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.702
COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:40.236
WORKING IN ISOLATION BUT THEY'RE

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:41.771
CONNECTING WITH ALL THOSE AROUND

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.640
THEM.

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:44.941
WE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.576
BUILDING POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:48.144
BOTH WITH THEIR PEERS.

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:50.447
AND WITH ADULTS AND THAT THEY'RE

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:52.415
INVOLVED IN ADVOCACY SO SOME OF

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:54.250
THOSE TYPES OF ADVOCACY WOULD

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:55.585
INCLUDE WORKING WITH MERCHANTS

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:57.787
LOCALLY SO WORKING WITH ALCOHOL

00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:58.655
AND TOBACCO MERCHANTS ARE NOW

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:00.623
WORKING WITH CANNABIS MERCHANTS

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.925
AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:02.859
MERCHANTS

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:04.427
ARE RESPONSIBLE AND THEIR

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.995
BEHAVIORS AND THE COMMUNITY SO

00:56:06.062 --> 00:56:08.231
LOOKING AT INVESTING WHERE WE'RE

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:09.199
GOING TO SEE AN INCREASED

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:10.967
AVAILABILITY BECAUSE WHERE

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.736
THERE'S INCREASED AVAILABILITY.

00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:14.637
YOU'LL SEE INCREASE PROBLEMS SO

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:15.805
THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:16.973
STRATEGIES TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.308
WHERE TO INVEST.

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:19.275
TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE YOU'RE

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:21.177
HAVING MORE SALES AND MORE

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:22.112
AVAILABLE PRODUCT.

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:25.248
VERY GOOD ONE OTHER QUESTION --

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:27.450
YOU TALK ABOUT AVOID SUBSCRIBING

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:30.386
TO THE DRUG OF THE MONTH CLUB --

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:32.088
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT IS

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:33.923
EFFECTIVE --

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:37.494
PREVENTION STRATEGY.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.661
BACK A REALLY GREAT QUESTION DOT.

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:39.629
WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT WHATEVER

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:42.198
SEEMS TO BE THE DRUG ABUSE TODAY

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:43.666
BECOMES THE FOCUS OF OUR

00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:45.101
PREVENTION EFFORTS.

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:46.903
AND WHAT WE THEN MISS BY DOING

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.271
SO IS THINKING ABOUT WHY ARE

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:50.340
YOUNG PEOPLE NEEDING TO FEEL

00:56:50.406 --> 00:56:52.108
DIFFERENT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE AND

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:53.243
WHERE THEY ARE.

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:54.811
SO LOOKING AT MORE YOUTH

00:56:54.878 --> 00:56:56.346
DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES AND

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:58.381
OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE SUPPORTS

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:00.250
AND OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:01.451
GETTING TO THE ROOT CAUSES.

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:05.622
BECAUSE ALCOHOL IS ALWAYS THERE.

00:57:05.688 --> 00:57:07.857
IT IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE

00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:08.725
DRUG OF CHOICE.

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:10.593
YET WE'LL SEE WHAT WE MAY TERM

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.729
AS EPIDEMICS ON OTHER DRUGS AS

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:14.931
THEY BECOME AVAILABLE SO VAPING

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:16.800
IS A HUGE ISSUE RIGHT NOW.

00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:17.734
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BECOME A BIG

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:19.235
ISSUE.

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:20.770
BUT WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:22.772
DRUGS INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:24.641
UNDERLYING ISSUES AS TO WHY

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:26.476
THEY'RE CHOOSING TO DO THAT.

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:27.577
SO OUR HOPE IS THAT IN OUR

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:29.179
PREVENTION EFFORTS CERTAINLY WE

00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:31.548
WILL EDUCATE THEM ABOUT WHAT

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:33.983
HAPPENS TO THEIR BRAINS.

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:34.784
THEY KNOW SOME OF THAT WE DON'T

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:36.319
KNOW ALL OF THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:38.087
KNOW THAT BEST OF THE RENTAL CAR

00:57:38.154 --> 00:57:39.789
COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY WON'T

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:41.324
RENT A CAR TO SOMEBODY UNDER.

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:42.725
TWENTY FIVE THERE YOU GO.

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:44.194
BUT FOR THE REST OF US TRYING TO

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:42.605
THE QUESTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:43.973
IN THE PROP SIXTY FOUR

STAKEHOLDERS GROUP WAS ONE OF

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:46.843
THE PLACES IN WHICH YOU HAD A

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.511
WIDE ARRAY OF PEOPLE COMING

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:49.512
TOGETHER.

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.514
AND WE DID HAVE REPRESENTATION

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.182
FROM THE DEPARTMENTS AT THOSE

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:54.617
MEETINGS AT TIMES --

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:55.918
THEY CERTAINLY WERE NOT IN A

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:58.121
POSITION TO MAKE ANY STATEMENTS

01:00:58.187 --> 01:00:59.722
OR TAKE ANY POSITIONS.

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.190
BUT THEIR PRESENCE CERTAINLY

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.725
DEMONSTRATED THEIR WILLINGNESS

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.127
TO BE AWARE WHAT WAS GOING ON

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:06.195
AND TO HEAR WHAT WAS HAPPENING

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.797

PROJECTS ITH EACH OF THE THREE

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:14.804
DEPARTMENTS TRY TO DEMONSTRATE

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:16.372
THAT THERE IS CAPACITY THAT

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:17.907
COULD BE EXPANDED.

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.575
AND WHEN RESOURCES BECOME

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:21.277
AVAILABLE HAPPY TO DO SO BUT

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.413
AGAIN TRYING NOT TO BE CUED UP

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:24.747
TO BE AGAIN THE DRUG OF THE

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:25.615
MONTH CLUB.

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:27.283
BY CUED UP TO WORK ON A WHOLE

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.052
RANGE OF SERVICES THAT WILL

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:29.852
ADDRESS.

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:31.421
THE UNDER AGE MARIJUANA USE AS

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:36.426
WELL SUBSTANCES AS WELL.

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:39.962
AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT --

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.564
THAT CAME UP IN THE LAST PANEL

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:43.566
AGAIN IS THAT --

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:45.868
WE DON'T KNOW HOW WALL TILE THE

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.370
THE MONEY WILL BE RIGHT ONE

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:49.372
HOPES THAT OVER TIME WE HAVE AN

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:50.406
EXPECTED AMOUNT BUT IT'S

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:51.908
POSSIBLE.

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.276
THAT YOU COULD SEE VERY A SWINGS

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.912
BECAUSE THE WAY THE MONEY FLOWS

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:57.213
RIGHT PART ONE PART TWO FINALLY

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.448
DOWN TO THIS ONE SO YOU CATCH

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.982
WHATEVER'S LEFT RIGHT SO COULD

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.452
BE A LOT ONE YEAR IT'S POSSIBLE

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:04.420
MIGHT DECLINE ANOTHER.

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:05.455
MAYBE AND WE DON'T KNOW THIS CAN

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:06.456
BE CORRELATED ECONOMY OR NOT HOW

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:07.824
MUCH EXACTLY.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.625
YOU KNOW HOW LARGE THE BLACK

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.494
MARKET GETS OR SHRINKS OR SO

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:12.595
FORTH.

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.062
SO.

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:13.963
FROM.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.231
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE I KNOW YOU

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:18.234
SPOKE MORE PRESSURE PROGRAMMATIC

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.636
LEE BUT HOW DO YOU THINK WE

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:22.805
SHOULD HANDLE THIS OUR ADDRESS

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:23.739
THIS --

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:25.541
POSSIBILITY OF VERY ABILITY

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:26.542
BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:29.045
RIGHT WELL YOU IT'S NOT LIKE --

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:30.947
WHAT'S ONE YEAR WE CAN SELL THE

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:31.981
RAMP UP THE PROGRAM AND TRAIN A

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:33.449
WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND THEN.

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:35.585
DOWNSIZE IT --

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:38.187
BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE NO MONEY OR

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:38.955
WELL.

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:41.457
SO HOW IT HOW HOW THIS HOW HOW

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:42.525
WOULD YOU SEE --

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.127
THAT THAT WE HANDLE THIS

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:45.361
VOLATILITY AND SOME PEOPLE SAY

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:46.662
WELL TO MOVE ALL THE MONEY ON

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.064
THE STREET RIGHT AWAY RIGHT --

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:49.632
BUT THEN YOU COULD HAVE THESE

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:51.934
REALLY BIG SWINGS OR SOME PEOPLE

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:53.436
SAY WELL LET'S BUILD UP AT A

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:55.271
RESERVE AND SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:56.439
SO THAT WE CAN KEEP TO SETTLE

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:58.207
LOOKS MORE STEADY LEVEL MAYBE

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.476
LOWER LEVEL BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:01.644
SORT OF GUESS A LITTLE BIT.

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:02.545
SO WITH EVERY SOME THOUGHTS

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.046
ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD HANDLE THE

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.715
THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS

01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:07.416
IN RELATION TO THE VOLATILITY OF

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:09.819
POTENTIAL VOLATILITY I DON'T

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:12.955
KNOW THE SOURCE.

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:14.390
ALL THIS THROUGHOUT A COUPLE

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:15.391
COMMENTS OUT THERE I THINK THIS

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.460
NEEDS A HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:19.829
PLAN OKAY --

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:23.733
AND AND EACH ONE OF THOSE --

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:25.368
COMPARTMENTS ENTERED IN A FIRE

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.969
WITHIN AT STRATEGIC PLAN

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.504
TIMELINE AND ROLLED OUT.

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:29.205
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IF WE

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:30.573
TRAIN OF THE WORK FORCE TODAY WE

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.375
WOULDN'T HAVE THE FACILITIES. TO

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:33.843
GET THE FACILITIES WE HAVE A A

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.511
REGULATORY QUAGMIRE ESPECIALLY

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:36.779
WAS RESIDENTIAL --

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:40.183
AND DETOXIFICATION SERVICES --

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:41.684
THAT CURRENTLY IN VERY DIFFICULT

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:42.785
FOR PROVIDERS TO NAVIGATE SO WE

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.320
NEED.

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:45.054
TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.722
SO MY MY RECOMMENDATION IS A

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:49.025
HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC PLAN THAT

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:49.959
TIME LINE.

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:53.829
AND THEN WE JUST ROLLED OUT

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:57.400
BASED ON THOSE DECISIONS --

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:58.301
WELL I RECOGNIZE YOUR ASKING

01:03:58.367 --> 01:03:59.101
PARTIALLY KINDA HOW TO YOU KNOW

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.269
HOW DOES THE PROGRAM OPERATE

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.571
QUESTION --

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.539
AND I THINK OUR HOW YOU THINK

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:04.173
YOU SHOULD ARE HOW I THINK IT'S

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.809
OVER DISCUSS SOMETHING THAT I

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:09.045
THINK IT'S RELATED TO THAT WHICH

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:11.480
IS -- ONE I

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:13.382
MEAN WE STRUGGLE WITH THIS WITH

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:15.918
YOU KNOW BEING FOUNDATION FUNDED.

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.553
OFTEN ALL OF THE TIME AND I KNOW

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.222
AND THAT KIND OF TOBACCO CONTROL

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:20.756
WORLD ALSO REVENUES HAVE BEEN

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.159
YOU KNOW SLOWLY DECLINING OVER

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:24.727
THE YEARS --

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:26.028
ONE THING I'D SAY IS THAT WE

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:27.563
REALLY DO A LOT TO FOCUS THE

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.565
PROGRAMMATIC EFFORTS ON BUILDING

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:30.967
SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.969
COMMUNITIES SO.

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.203
YOU KNOW I'M NOT JUST.

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.371
PEOPLE KEEP COMING THROUGH THE

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:36.806
DOOR AND WE KEEP NEEDING TO

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.207
PROVIDE THE SERVICES OVER AND

01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:39.909
OVER AGAIN BUT HOW DO WE DESIGN

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:40.876
THE PROGRAM.

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:43.012
SO THAT WERE BUILDING LEADERSHIP

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.647
OVER THE LONG TERM TO ADDRESS

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.549
THIS AND A HOST OF ISSUES.

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:48.017
THAT AFFECT COMMUNITY HEALTH AND

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:49.919
WELL BEING AND THEN HOW DO WE

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:51.420
BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:54.657
COMMUNITIES THAT HAS A LONGER

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.525
YOU KNOW SHELF LIFE.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.660
AND THEN YOU KNOW THAT THE FUNDS

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:58.561
FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO I THINK

01:04:58.628 --> 01:04:59.395
THAT'LL BE AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:02.198
ATTIC ELEMENT.

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:03.132
AND I WOULD TAKE --

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:06.369
MAYBE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:08.237
AND ONE THAT WILL BE HEARD

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:09.138
ANYONE ELSE'S I HOPE THERE IS NO

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:10.139
MONEY AVAILABLE I HOPE THAT OUR

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:12.975
PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE SO GOOD.

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.644
THAT THE REVENUES ARE NOT HIGH

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:16.545
ENOUGH THAT WE INVEST IN THIS

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:18.414
CATEGORY.

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:19.682
BEING THAT THAT PROBABLY WILL

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.550
NOT BE THE CASE.

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:23.319
I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:25.087
LOOKING AT PROBABLY A TWO TO

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:26.355
THREE YEAR LAG TIME.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:29.191
BEFORE YOU SEE ENOUGH REVENUE TO

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:30.760
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM.

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:32.662
AND I WOULD SUGGEST NOT PUTTING

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:35.097
OUT DRIBBLING SMALL AMOUNTS BUT

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.165
WAITING UNTIL YOU CAN DO

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:37.867
SOMETHING CORRECTLY.

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:38.934
AND MAKING SURE THAT YOUR

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:41.337
INVESTMENT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:42.905
WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE IS A

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:45.908
MOVEMENT RATHER THAN MOMENTS WE

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:47.943
CAN PUT A LITTLE BIT SOME MONEY

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.345
OUT AND CREATE OF BATS?

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:50.946
BUT EVENTS WON'T CREATE A

01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:53.449
MOVEMENT NOR CHANGE SOCIAL NORMS.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.217
SO MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:56.786
BE ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:58.187
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:05:58.254 --> 01:05:59.722
IF YOU HAVE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:02.358
DO SMALL PILOT PROJECTS.

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:03.759
BUT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:06.929
THAT CHOOSE AND AGAIN I HOPE

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.698
THAT OUR PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:09.832
SO GOOD.

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.967
THAT WE'LL SEE AN INITIAL BUBBLE

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:12.601
AND THEN THAT WAS FINDINGS WILL

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:14.570
BE REDUCED.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:16.238
AND I KNOW WE HAVE THE THREE OF

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.707
YOU HERE WILL PREPARE FOR SOME

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.075
MORE PEOPLE IN PUBLIC COMMENT

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:21.110
BUT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:23.312
THERE.

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:24.447
WELL IN ANY COALITION --

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:25.214
MAY HAVE THE DESERVE GENERAL

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:26.349
AGREEMENT IN TERMS OF DIRECTION

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:28.651
ON HOW WE SHOULD BE AS THE WE

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:30.119
HAVE THE AGENCIES COMING UP

01:06:30.186 --> 01:06:33.189
RIGHT AFTER YOU BUT IN TERMS OF

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:35.858
VERY STAKEHOLDERS AND STIR SOME

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:36.258
IS.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:37.526
THERE HOW MUCH DIVISION --

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:39.295
AGREEMENT IS THERE ABOUT HOW WE

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:40.162
SHOULD --

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:43.599
HOW HOW WE SHOULD ADDRESS NOW

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:43.833
THIS --

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.968
SPENDS MONEY.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:46.535
I THINK YOU'RE STAKEHOLDERS

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:47.670
GROUP IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:49.238
CONSENSUS DOCUMENTS OKAY THERE

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:50.940
ARE MANY AREAS WHERE THERE IS

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:53.476
NOT CONSENSUS THE PRIMARY ONE

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:55.344
WILL BE HOW MUCH MONEY DO INVEST

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:56.312
IN TREATMENT.

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:58.280
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU INVEST IN IN

01:06:58.347 --> 01:06:58.714
PREVENTION?

01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:01.083
THAT IS A DYNAMIC TENSION THAT

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.785
SEEMS TO NEVER GO AWAY.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.320
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:07.923
TO TREAT EVERYONE WHO IS IN NEED-OF TREATMENT AND IF YOU DON'T

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:09.225
INVEST ENOUGH IN PREVENTION.

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.760
YOU'LL KEEP GETTING MORE PEOPLE

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:13.763
IN NEED OF TREATMENT FOREVER

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.831
DEBATING THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT AND

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:17.400
WHERE YOU PUT IT BUT PERHAPS WE

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:18.768
SHOULD THINK ABOUT MECHANISM TO

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:20.903
HAVE THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION YES

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:21.670
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:24.340
YES YOU THERE HAS ALSO BEEN --

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:26.142
BUT ED CONSENSUS DOCUMENT PUT

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.677
TOGETHER BY A GROUP OF

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.479
ORGANIZATIONS LOOKING AT TRAUMA

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:34.517
INFORMED APPROACHES AND I'M

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:35.785
BLANKING ON THE NAME OF THAT

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:38.053
IT'S A LONG ACRONYM BUT I'M SURE

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.422
THOSE SOME OF THOSE WHO WILL BE --

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:40.689
PROVIDING COMMENT MAY KNOW THE

01:07:40.756 --> 01:07:42.191
NAME OF IT --

01:07:42.258 --> 01:07:43.292
AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:44.593
IMPORTANT PIECE TO LOOK AT AS

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.228
WELL BECAUSE IT KIND OF TALK

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:47.696
THROUGH THE DIFFERENT --

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:49.732
APPROACHES THAT COULD BE TAKEN

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:52.301
AND THE WAY THEY CAN BE REALLY --

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:55.004
A TAILORED IN A WAY TO BE TRAUMA

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:56.238
INFORMED.

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:57.706
AND THEN FINALLY --

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.141
BECAUSE WE ARE HAVING THE

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.443
AGENCY'S COME UP AFTER YOU AND

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:01.377
WE DID THAT.

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:02.478
INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:03.379
BE SURE THAT --

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:05.047
THEY HEARD WHAT YOU SAID AND

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:07.483
ALSO PERHAPS RESPONDED --

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.585
WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS DO YOU

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:11.420
THINK THAT I SHOULD?

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:12.955
WE SHOULD BE ASKING THEM OR

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:14.056
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THAT WE

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.458
WOULD THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:21.931
HEAR FROM THE AGENCIES --

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.866
CENTER PAN OWN.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:24.900
YOU KNOW.

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:25.668
FROM A PROVIDER'S PERSPECTIVE

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.436
THE REGULATORY PROCESS OF

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:29.205
LICENSING --

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:31.307
IS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING AND I

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:32.475
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.210
CHALLENGING FOR THE DEPARTMENT

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.478
TO WORK THROUGH AS WELL.

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:37.480
THE CAMPUS THAT I TALK TO YOU

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.882
ABOUT --

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:43.085
JUST IN OUR OUTPATIENT PROGRAM

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:44.587
SERVICES TO THE THE FULL BREADTH

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:46.121
OF THE COMMUNITY --

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:47.790
OR LICENSED AND CERTIFIED FOR

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:49.458
MENTAL HEALTH OR LICENSED AND

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:50.659
CERTIFIED FOR ISSUE DE WERE

01:08:50.726 --> 01:08:53.629
LICENSED AND CERTIFIED IN FOUR

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:55.164
OR FIVE DIFFERENT AREAS.

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:56.999
ALL TO DRIVE SERVICES AT A ONE

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:58.868
AREAS SO COLLECTIVELY HOW DO WE

01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:00.903
MAKE TO REGULATORY PROCESS

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:04.106
EASIER FOR PROVIDERS TO APPLY

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:06.809
AND IT HERE [inaudible]

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.677
TO I'M.

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:10.946
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IN

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:12.748
PUBLIC HEALTH AND PREVENTION --

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.917
WE NOTICES THAT --

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.719
FUNDING STREAMS OFTEN GET SILO

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:17.219
TO YOU KNOW TO DEALWITH

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:20.256
PARTICULAR DISEASE STATE SEN YOU

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:21.757
KNOW THIS --

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:22.658
ONE I THINK WE REALLY HAVE AN

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.794
OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF VERSUS TO

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.363
THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND I

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:28.631
KNOW THERE IS.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:29.698
YOU BASED ON THE PROPOSITION

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.500
LANGUAGE OF FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.435
USE AND AND YOUTH I THINK THAT

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.471
LEAVES A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY --

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.072
TO REALLY TAKE LESSONS FROM

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:39.208
OTHER SILENT PROGRAMS AND DESIGN

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.676
IT IN A WAY THAT --

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:43.112
ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY AT THE

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:45.581
COMMUNITY LEVEL AND I'D LIKE

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:46.782
TECH KIND OF HERE YOU KNOW HERE

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.484
FROM THE DEPARTMENTS ABOUT HOW

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.020
THAT WILL BE APPROACHED I THINK

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:53.556
THAT'LL BE A CRITICAL PIECE.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:54.456
I THINK ITS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.258
MOVE FROM SILOS TO SYNERGY --

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.928
WE SEE GREAT PROGRAMS IN EACH OF

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.996
THE THREE DEPARTMENTS AND IT'S

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:02.364
THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:04.066
THAT ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT.

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:05.868
YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:07.636
DIFFERENCES AND WHERE THE MONEY

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:08.437
COMES FROM.

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:10.372
ALL THEY SEE IS WHAT KIND OF

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:12.241
SERVICES AVAILABLE WHAT KIND OF

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:14.276
SUPPORTS CAN I BE A PART OUT.

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:17.313
SO IT'S GETTING THOSE.

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:18.614
GUERRILLAS IN THE LIVING ROOM TO

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.549
FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:21.951
WORK TOGETHER IT'S NOT EASY.

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:24.386
THEIR HUGE SYSTEMS AND EACH HAS

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.155
CREATED WONDERFUL WAYS TO

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:28.090
DISSEMINATE RESOURCES THROUGH

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:29.625
THEIR INDIVIDUAL SILO AND THE

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:31.794
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.228
ARE ALWAYS CHALLENGING.

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:34.396
THIS CREATES AT OPPORTUNITY TO

BACK AND STEP IN A LITTLE BIT

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:15.870

I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.864
HIGHLIGHT SPECIFICALLY AROUND

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:44.833
THE U. STUFF --

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:46.201
WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THOSE MONIES?

RANGING FROM NALOXONE

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.777
DISTRIBUTION SO OBVIOUSLY A HUGE

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:57.345
AMOUNT OF THAT IS JUST GETTING --

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.547
NALOXONE INTO THE HANDS OF

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:01.349

HOSPITALS MORE BROADLY --

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:17.565
FOR SERVICES IN THE ER SUCH THAT

WHEN PEOPLE COME AND THERE'S AN

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.368
ABILITY TO KIND OF WORK WITH

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:29.704
IT HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.272
IN WHICH THE INITIATIVE SAYS YOU

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:33.441
COULD FIND THIS BUT IT ALSO IS

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:34.776
PROGRESSIVE RIGHT YOU MADE DO

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:35.944
THESE FUNDING.

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.212
OPPORTUNITIES BUT YOU COULD ALSO

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:38.947
DO OTHER THINGS AND I THINK WE

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:40.815
ARE LOOKING AT THIS MORE BROADLY

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:43.084
IS HOW DO WE BOTH WORK TOGETHER

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:47.188
BUT WAY THAT WE ARE TARGETING

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:50.692
USE AND FOCUSING MOST

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:52.327
EFFECTIVELY ON PREVENTION

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:54.629
THERE'S NOT AS MUCH FUNDING.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:55.797
AND PREVENTION EVER RIGHT I'M A

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.766

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:59.334
LOT OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:01.035
SYSTEM TYPES OF EXPENDITURES BUT

01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:02.871
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PREVENTION

01:24:02.937 --> 01:24:03.905
DOLLARS IN MEDICAID AND SO I

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:05.640
THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS FROM

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.642
A MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.411
BUT ALSO VERY MUCH DRAWING.

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:13.648
EARLY INTERVENTION SIDE OF THE

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.150

CAN'T -- THE

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:53.080
ADULT USE MARIJUANA ACT PASSED

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:54.448
IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AS WE

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:55.516
ALL KNOW.

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:57.718
RUMOR HAS IT THAT OF THE

01:30:57.785 --> 01:30:59.887
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:00.154
SERVICES.

WITH THE P. AGENCY D. E. TO

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:08.095
DEVELOP AN INTER AGENCY

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:09.530
AGREEMENT --

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:12.366
AS IS REQUIRED SO IS THAT TRUE

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:14.402
AND IF SO WHY.

01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:16.170
SURE SO I THINK --

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:18.039
WHEN THE ACT WAS PASSED --

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:20.575
AND WE WERE AWARE THAT THERE

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:22.510
WERE NOT FUNDS BEING MADE IT

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:24.178
IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE I THINK

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:27.448
THAT WE WE'RE DOING YOU KNOW

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:28.349
OTHER.

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:29.550
ACTIVITIES RIGHT WE'VE BEEN

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:31.285
DOING A TON OF STUFF ON OPIOIDS

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:32.186
AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE AND

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:33.888
WE DID AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.456
FOR THE FIRST FIVE MILLION.

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:37.525
SO THERE WAS SOME CONTACT BOTH

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:39.060
WITH DPH NOT NECESSARILY SEE

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:40.228
EITHER BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:41.829
FUNDS AVAILABLE I THINK THAT.

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:43.531
WE DO INTER AGENCY AGREEMENTS

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:45.399
WITH EACH OTHER AND A VARIETY OF

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:47.535
WAYS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:48.803
MAY PROPOSAL --

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:50.171

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:53.140
BUDGET KIND OF OUTLINES.

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:54.642
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW THE

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:56.277
GOVERNOR WOULD I SEE THOSE FUNDS

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:58.779
BEING SPENT WE WOULD BE WORKING

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:00.348
ON INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS A KIND

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:01.883
OF CONFORM WITH THAT.

01:32:01.949 --> 01:32:03.351
OVERALL.

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:05.219
DESIGN SO I THINK IT WAS ONE OF

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:06.787
THOSE THINGS THAT WE WERE NOT

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.222
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:09.156
EITHER THE PREVIOUS

01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:10.391
ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:11.559
DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:12.593
HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.561
SPENT BECAUSE THEY SENT.

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:15.196
SIMPLY WEREN'T AVAILABLE AND NOW

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:17.231
THAT WE'RE STILL AITING FOR THE

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:18.532
CONFIRMATION OF WHAT THOSE FUNDS

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:19.567
WILL LOOK LIKE THEN WE WOULD

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:22.603
WORK ON INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:23.170
TO KIND OF CONFORM WITH THAT

01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:24.972
PROPOSAL.

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:25.506
YES GOOD --

01:32:25.573 --> 01:32:26.407
I WANT TO ADD TO THAT WE HAVE

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:27.742
BEEN WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:29.343
TOGETHER AND COORDINATING VERY

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:31.345
CLOSELY OUR ACTIVITIES IN TERMS

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:33.080
OF BUILDING --

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:34.916
BOTH PREVENTION AND TREATMENT

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:37.184
USE IT UNDER USING LEVERAGING

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:38.719
QUITE FRANKLY THE OPIATE MANY

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:40.588
SIT BUT BUT ALSO.

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:41.722
ACTUALLY ACTIVELY SITTING DOWN

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:43.357
AT A TABLE AND SAYING SORT OF

01:32:43.424 --> 01:32:44.625
WHERE IS YOUR EXPERTISE WHERE IS

01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:45.826
OUR EXPERTISE.

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.428
TO DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ARE

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:49.130
GETTING SILOS MANY WERE ACTUALLY

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:51.866
CROSSING OVER AND AND SORT OF

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:53.067
COURSE TRADING WHILE YOU'RE

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:54.468
REALLY MUCH BETTER IF YOU KNOW

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:56.470
DETAILING WITH PHYSICIANS WERE

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:57.905
MUCH BETTER IT BUILDING.

01:32:57.972 --> 01:32:59.540
DATA SYSTEMS AN EVALUATION OR

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:01.475
EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS AND SO

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:03.144
LITERALLY --

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:07.515
ON AS THESE FINE AND WE'RE JUST

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:09.116
FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH DIFFERENT

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:11.319
SPECIFICS WERE ACTUALLY CREATING

01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:12.920
A VERY INTEGRATED.

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.422
SYSTEM THAT.

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:16.390
IS FOCUSED ON EXACTLY THE SAME

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:18.192
THING IT'S NOT THE DRUG OF

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:19.427
CHOICE WE'RE NOT BUILDING

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:21.495
EXCLUSIVELY CERTAIN ASPECTS ARE

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:22.797
NALOXONE FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:24.098
REALLY HAVE A ROLE.

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:26.500
EXCEPT THAT IT'S BUILDINGFOR US

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:28.769
A NETWORK OF PARTNERS WITHIN

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:31.172
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WHO WILL

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:32.506
BE WORKING WITH US AROUND

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:34.275
REPORTING CANNABIS YOU KNOW

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:35.276
NEGATIVE OUTCOMES FROM CANNABIS

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:36.644
IT CETERA AND SO.

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:38.112
I THINK THAT WHILE WE DIDN'T

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:41.716
HAVEN'T BEEN DEVELOPING SPECIFIC --

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:43.351
I. A.'S WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:44.485
LEARNING HOW TO WORK TOGETHER

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:46.520
AND HAVE REALLY GOOD MODELS NOW

01:33:46.587 --> 01:33:48.089
ON HOW WE FIGURE OUT.

01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:50.491
YOU GUYS DO SCHOOLS REALLY WELL

01:33:50.558 --> 01:33:52.093
YOU DO HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WE

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:54.195
DO WE SUPPORT COALITIONS AND

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:55.763
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:56.597
WHICH ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:58.866
OPIATES BUT WON'T ALWAYS BE.

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:00.735
AND GETTING THOSE COSS SECTOR

01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:01.936
PARTNERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS

01:34:02.003 --> 01:34:03.537
CAN BE CRITICAL TO US GETTING

01:34:03.604 --> 01:34:05.172
ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD TRACTION.

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:08.876
IN PREVENTING CANNABIS OVER USE

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:11.345
IN YOUTH FRANKLY.

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:12.279
THANK YOU FOR THAT SO WHAT.

01:34:12.346 --> 01:34:13.280
ARE YOU READY TO HIT THE GROUND

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:14.615
RUNNING I MEAN I I GUESS MY

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:16.884
WORRY IS THAT THAT PASSED IN TWO

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:17.485
THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE'S BEEN

01:34:17.551 --> 01:34:18.853
TWO YEARS --

01:34:18.919 --> 01:34:20.054
YOU'RE RIGHT EVERYBODY HAS THEIR

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:22.423
EXPERTISE BUT ARE YOU GUYS READY

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:24.759
ONCE NOW THE FUNDING IS COMING

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:26.727
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN HEAVY SET

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:27.661
PRIORITIES.

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:30.731
HAVE YOU IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES --

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:32.967
TO HAVE NEAR AND LONG TERM GOALS

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:35.336
MY MY CONCERN IS THAT THE THESE

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:36.904
THINGS HAPPEN AND THERE'S AN

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.205
EXPECTATION.

01:34:38.272 --> 01:34:40.007
THAT WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR JOB

01:34:40.074 --> 01:34:43.044
YOU GUYS ARE KIND SOMETIMES WE

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:45.246
FIND OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:46.947
RIGHT AND I THINK --

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:48.482
AGAIN JUST YOU KNOW TO BACK TO

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:51.485
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES

01:34:51.552 --> 01:34:53.320
OVERALL STATEMENT IN TERMS OF TO

01:34:53.387 --> 01:34:54.722
THE EXTENT THAT FUNDS ARE BEING

01:34:54.789 --> 01:34:58.759
APPROPRIATED IN THIS BUCKET --

01:34:58.826 --> 01:35:01.695
THREE SOME OF THE PART OF THE

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:03.631
NAY REVISION WILL KIND OF SHOW

01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:05.566

01:35:05.633 --> 01:35:07.601
THINKING AND GOALS AND

01:35:07.668 --> 01:35:09.303
OBJECTIVES THAT WE OURSELVES

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:10.805
HAVE THOUGHT OF AS AND THAT WILL

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.073
BE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:15.376
PROPOSAL IN MAY AND SO I CAN YOU

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:16.310

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:17.445
COULD NOT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.380
IS THE IT IS THE PART OF THE

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:20.281
GOVERNOR AND TERMINATE HISMAY

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:22.349
PROPOSAL BUT I THINK THAT IS

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:22.950
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:23.684
WOULD.

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.386
PROPOSE AND SAY HERE'S THE TIME

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:27.455
FRAME FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF

01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:28.722
THOSE FUNDS HERE'S WHAT THOSE

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:31.092
FUNDS WOULD BE IN A PROPOSED TO

01:35:31.158 --> 01:35:32.526
BE.

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:33.194
PORTION OUT OF YOU KNOW IN

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.695
CERTAIN WAYS AND THESE ARE THE

01:35:34.762 --> 01:35:36.230
WAYS THAT WE WOULD BE WORKING

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:37.364
WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP

01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:39.467

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:41.202
THE EXPENDITURE OR THAT PROCESS

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:42.536
AND SO I THINK ALL OF THAT IS

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:43.637
STILL --

01:35:43.704 --> 01:35:45.272

FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION BUT

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:49.477
IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE AS PART OF

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:51.212
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL

01:35:57.351 --> 01:35:58.519
I THINK THAT WE HAVE --

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.554
OUR BEST THINKING AND THOUGHTS

01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:02.256
AND THAT THOSE ARE BEING PUT

01:36:02.323 --> 01:36:03.290
THROUGH THE INTERNAL IT

01:36:03.357 --> 01:36:05.426
MINISTRATION BUDGET DEVELOPMENT

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:08.662

01:36:08.729 --> 01:36:10.831
SURE YES.

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:12.833
I JUST WERE JUST YOU KNOW THIS

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.402
IS A BIG DEAL I I I WAS OF

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:17.538
LEGALIZING MARIJUANA --

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:19.673
BECAUSE I WORRY THAT WE ARE

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.308
GOING TO BE READY AND WE'RE NOT

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:22.443
GOING TO HAVE THE RIGHT

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:23.744
PREVENTION--

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:25.846
IN PLACE SO IT'S IT'S YOU GUYS

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:27.414
HAVE A REALLY BIG JOB AND I JUST

01:36:27.481 --> 01:36:28.849
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:30.484
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:31.519
PROTECT OUR YOUTH THAT'S ALL

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:32.586
WELL AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:34.321
THE INITIATIVE IN ADDITION TO

01:36:34.388 --> 01:36:35.489
REQUIRING THE I. A.'S ALSO

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:36.590
REQUIRES A STAKEHOLDER.

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:40.427
PROCESS SO SOMETIMES --

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:42.363
EVEN IF WE HAD AS THREE

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:43.731
DEPARTMENT SAID THIS IS HOW THE

01:36:43.797 --> 01:36:45.866
I. A.'S SHOULD WORK BETWEEN US.

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:47.835
IT'S COMPLETELY CONCEIVABLE THAT

01:36:47.902 --> 01:36:49.136
THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WOULD

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:50.905
COME AND SAY NO WE DON'T AGREE

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:52.239
RIGHT AND YOU WOULD COR YOU

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:53.574
WOULD GET FEEDBACK OR YOU WOULD

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.276
GET EXPERTISE FROM A DIFFERENT

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:56.744
ORGANIZATION OUR PARTNER WHERE

01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:57.711
THEY SAY YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT

01:36:57.778 --> 01:37:00.080
IT THIS WAY AND SO I WOULD SAY.

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:01.649
THAT THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AN

01:37:01.715 --> 01:37:03.918
INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS MAY FLOW

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:06.720
TOGETHER BASED ON BOTH YOU KNOW

01:37:06.787 --> 01:37:08.622
I THINK WE TRY VERY MUCH AS AS

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:10.324
WE CAN TO ACHIEVE A CONSENSUS

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:11.225
BASED.

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:13.394
PROPOSAL BUT CERTAINLY NEED THE

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.030
EXTERNAL PROCESS TO CONFIRM THAT

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:18.199
DECISION AS WELL AND SO I. A.'S

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:20.100
BETWEEN US ARE ALSO GOING TO BE

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:21.135
KIND OF INCOME AND ON THERE

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:22.336
BEING AN EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:24.004
PROCESS FOR WHICH THAT FLOWS

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:25.573
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S MADE ME

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:26.740
PROPOSAL.

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:27.741
AND THAT COULDN'T START UNTIL

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:28.576
NOW.

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:31.579
THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP WHEN WE

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:32.479
COULD HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:33.647
THEM OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.

01:37:33.714 --> 01:37:37.585
WELL I THINK IN SOME CASES THE

01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:41.388
AT WE HAVE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:43.190
PROCESS SEES THAT WE CURRENTLY

01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:44.692
HAVE AT THE DEPARTMENT --

01:37:44.758 --> 01:37:46.660
WE HAVE BROAD STAKEHOLDER GROUPS

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:48.896
WE HAVE USE ADVISORY GROUPS WE

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:50.898
HAVE INTERAGENCY PREVENTION.

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:53.467
COUNCILS WE HAVE --

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:54.235
A LOT OF DIFFERENT BEHAVIORAL

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:55.202
HEALTH STAKEHOLDER GROUPS I

01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:56.370
THINK YOU KNOW WITHIN MY

01:37:56.437 --> 01:37:58.305
DEPARTMENT ALONE NOT TO SPEAK TO

01:37:58.372 --> 01:37:59.673
YOUR DEPARTMENT --

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:01.642
I PROBABLY HAVE THIRTY OR FORTY

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:03.210
DIFFERENT KINDS OF STAKEHOLDER

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:04.478
PROCESS THESE WORKGROUPS

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:05.813
ADVISORY COMMITTEES AT ANY GIVEN

01:38:05.879 --> 01:38:09.149
TIME AND SO I THINK THAT --

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:10.884
WE HAVE SOME THINKING WE

01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:11.986
CERTAINLY HAVE EXISTING

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:13.320
PREVENTION PROGRAMS WE HAVE

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:16.156
EXISTING PREVENTION CONTRACTS --

01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:18.025
AND ADVISORY GROUPS AND SO ALL

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:20.160
OF THAT IS GOING INTO DEVELOPING

01:38:20.227 --> 01:38:21.729
THE THINKING FOR THIS NEW FUND

01:38:21.795 --> 01:38:23.831
SOURCE AS WELL AS HOW DO WE KIND

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:25.432
OF BOTH STRENGTH IN OUR EXISTING

01:38:25.499 --> 01:38:28.202
INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK AGAIN --

01:38:28.269 --> 01:38:29.937
DOCTOR COOLEY REFERENCES AS WELL

01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:31.238
AS WE HAVE CAPACITY IN

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:32.973
CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVE BUILT WE

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.675
HAVE KNOWN PROGRAMS WE HAVE

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:35.843
KNOWN --

01:38:35.909 --> 01:38:37.645
PARTNERS AND SO YOU KNOW YOUR

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:39.146
FIRST STEP AS A DEPARTMENT IS TO

01:38:39.213 --> 01:38:40.481
LOOK AND SAY DO I NEED TO RE

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:42.416
CREATE SOMETHING AND I THINK

01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:43.250
THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY PART OF

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:45.286
THE THINKING THAT IS UNDER WAY

01:38:45.352 --> 01:38:45.986
WITHIN.

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:47.488
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION THE OTHER

01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:49.390
THING FOR US IS TO IS BEING

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:51.125
CAREFUL THAT WE'RE ONE OF THE

01:38:51.191 --> 01:38:52.026
REASONS WHY THAT STAKEHOLDER

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:53.427
PROCESS SYSTEM PART IS WE HAVE

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:54.795
TO UNDERSTAND NOT JUST WHAT THEY

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:55.763
WANT TO DO BUT WHAT IS THEIR

01:38:55.829 --> 01:38:56.930
CAPACITY.

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.666
BECAUSE WE WON'T BE DOING MOST

01:38:58.732 --> 01:38:59.967
OF THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND

01:39:00.034 --> 01:39:01.568
OBVIOUSLY IT WILL BE LOCAL

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:03.037
COMMUNITIES AND SO.

01:39:03.103 --> 01:39:05.306
BUT HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:09.076
WITH ABSOLUTELY HOW MUCH

01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:11.211
AVAILABLE BECOMES VERY SORT OF

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:12.780
HIGH LEVEL AND FUZZY AND NOT

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:14.114
SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT TO

01:39:14.181 --> 01:39:16.250
MAKE PEOPLE DO INTENSIVELY AND

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:17.651
CREATE A PLAN THAT MAY OR MAY

01:39:17.718 --> 01:39:18.686
NOT ACTUALLY WORK.

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:20.220
I'M JUST SORT OF HEARING ALL THE

01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:21.488
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE THINGS

01:39:21.555 --> 01:39:23.290
THAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT ON

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:25.259
WEIGHING IN ON HOW THE PROCESS

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:26.694
SHOULD WORK THREE THROUGH THE

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:27.928
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:29.496
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GET TOO FAR

01:39:29.563 --> 01:39:30.531
DOWN THE ROAD CREATING

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:32.733
UNINTENTIONAL EXPECTATIONS THAT

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.268
WE THEN CAN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON

01:39:34.335 --> 01:39:35.736
WHICH ISN'T SAY WE'RE NOT HAVING

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:37.404
THOSE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE WE

01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:39.606
ARE BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE HIGHER

01:39:39.673 --> 01:39:41.208
LEVEL CONVERSATIONS RATHER THAN

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.643
BEING THE DETAILED.

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:45.212
CONVERSATION.

01:42:12.025 --> 01:42:12.793
SEPARATE FROM EVERYTHING ELSE

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:14.127
WHO I CONNECTED SO I APPRECIATE

01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:15.028
THAT PRESENTATION.

01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:17.464
BUT I'M ALSO FOR THIS HEARING.

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:19.733
WHERE WOULD YOU SEE THIS FUND

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.702
FIT AND WHAT'S THE CT AND MORE

01:42:21.768 --> 01:42:22.769
SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS THE

01:42:22.836 --> 01:42:23.904
CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.539
STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW?

01:42:25.606 --> 01:42:27.641
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS YOU

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:30.244
KNOW GREAT OPERA TIONS SO

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:32.279
THERE'S FLEXIBILITY IT'S OF SOME

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:33.847
UNCERTAIN AMOUNTS IT'S PROBABLY

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.816
NOT AT THE SCALE NECESSARILY O

01:42:35.883 --> 01:42:37.284
SOME OF THE OTHER FUNDS THAT YOU

01:42:37.351 --> 01:42:38.886
MAY HAVE POSSIBLY I DON'T KNOW

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:40.120
WE DON'T KNOW BUT PROBABLY TO

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:42.289
ASSUME IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUITE.

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:44.057
THAT LARGE BUT IF THEY CAN BE

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:45.292
VERY NIMBLE POTENTIALLY

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:47.594
POTENTIALLY RIGHT BECAUSE THE

01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:49.830
LACK OF RESTRICTIONS SO DOLLARS

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:50.597
WE DON'T --

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:51.265
SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:53.300
CONVERSATIONS ARE BEING HAD WITH

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:55.736
STAKEHOLDERS A NOW ABOUT WHAT A

01:42:55.802 --> 01:42:59.106
WHOLE WHERE'S THIS FATTY OF THIS

01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:02.509
KIND OF MONEY BEST FIT. TO SPEAK

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:03.710
FOR OUR DEPARTMENT --

01:43:03.777 --> 01:43:05.178
WE HAVE HAD FROM THE THERE EVEN

01:43:05.245 --> 01:43:06.146
BEFORE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:07.014
PASSED AN ONGOING CONVERSATION

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.015
WITH OUR PARTNERS PARTICULARLY

01:43:08.081 --> 01:43:08.815
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BUT

01:43:08.882 --> 01:43:09.516
ALSO.

01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:11.785
YOU KNOW THE THE NONPROFIT AND

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:13.687
FOUNDATIONS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF

01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:15.589
CANNABIS AND WHAT IS WHAT IS

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:17.558
PREVENTION THAT IS SEPARATE FROM

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:18.692
TREATMENT.

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:21.895
AND FOR US SPECIFICALLY WE DON'T

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:23.697
WANT.

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:24.798
TO SOMETHING THAT VETS

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:27.134
DUPLICATIVE BECAUSE IT IMPACTS

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.368
OF THIS USED TO SERVICES IN IN

01:43:28.435 --> 01:43:29.336
PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUT

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:30.203
PUBLIC HEALTH DOES.

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:32.072
HAVE SORT OF STANDARD ROLES IN

01:43:32.139 --> 01:43:33.073
ISSUES LIKE THIS INCLUDES THINGS

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.541
LIKE THE ACQUISITION ANALYSIS OF

01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:37.978
DATA MONITORING EVALUATION --

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:39.179
PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:41.748
ETCETERA AND SO WE'VE HAD VERY --

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:43.250
GENERAL CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:44.718
IS IT IN TERMS OF THAT THOSE OF

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:46.853
US IN THE IN THE BROADER PUBLIC

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.288
HEALTH ARENA.

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:50.424
THINK IS OUR LIKELY TO BE OUR

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:51.725
ROLE SHOULD FINDING BECOME

01:43:51.792 --> 01:43:53.594
AVAILABLE AND WHAT DO PEOPLE

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.462
REALLY WANT TO SEE AND SO THOSE

01:43:55.529 --> 01:43:56.830
ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:58.065
CURRENTLY HAVING.

01:43:58.131 --> 01:43:59.766
AND THEY ARE INFORMING OUR

01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:02.769
CONVERSATIONS IT REALLY DOES

01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:03.904
COME OUT WHAT IS IT THAT.

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:06.440
AFTER THAT WE WANT TO DO WITHOUT

01:44:06.506 --> 01:44:07.941
FUNDING AND WHO ARE WHO WE WANT

01:44:08.008 --> 01:44:09.109
TO ENGAGE IN THE STAKEHOLDER

01:44:09.176 --> 01:44:10.243
PROCESS WHERE.

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:11.445
THE GENERAL CONVERSATIONS LEAD

01:44:11.511 --> 01:44:12.813
TO THE MUCH MORE SPECIFIC ONCE

01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:14.781
ONCE WE HAVE THE I. A.'S AND WE

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:18.051
KNOW WHO'S DOING WHAT.

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:19.486
SURE AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:21.288
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:22.856
BOTH -- WITH

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:25.759
ME PERSONALLY AND AS WELL AS MY

01:44:25.826 --> 01:44:28.528
STAFF IN VARIOUS FORUMS AND

01:44:28.595 --> 01:44:30.397
MEETINGS AND CONFERENCES --

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:31.698
WE HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:33.367
FOLKS THEY'RE THINKING IN TERMS

01:44:33.433 --> 01:44:35.869
OF YOU KNOW CERTAINLY A LOT OF

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.537
GROUPS HAVE REALLY --

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:39.106
BEEN PREDOMINATELY PUSHING A

01:44:39.172 --> 01:44:40.974
PREVENTION FOCUS --

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:42.643
YOU KNOW PHILOSOPHY SLASH YOU

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:44.778
KNOW AND IMPERATIVE AND I THINK

01:44:44.845 --> 01:44:46.847
THAT WE WOULD AGREE BROADLY WITH

01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:48.248
THAT BEING.

01:44:48.315 --> 01:44:50.584
PART OF KIND OF A DELIBERATE OF

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:52.085
PROCESS FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT

01:44:52.152 --> 01:44:52.653
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO

01:44:52.719 --> 01:44:53.487
COMMIT.

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:54.621
TO I THINK THAT WE HAVE HEARD

01:44:54.688 --> 01:44:59.960
AND BASED ON THE PREVIOUS PANELS --

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:01.862
POINT IS THAT THERE IS A STRONG

01:45:01.928 --> 01:45:04.197
TENSION BETWEEN TREATMENT AND

01:45:04.264 --> 01:45:05.432
PREVENTION AND SO THERE ARE

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:06.900
DYNAMICS --

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:08.568
FROM THE EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:09.870
THAT -- ARE

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:11.304
LEANING AND THEN CERTAINLY THE

01:45:11.371 --> 01:45:12.906
SCHOOLS --

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:14.074
WOULD BE A THIRD DYNAMIC IN

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:15.409
TERMS OF YOU KNOW IS IS IT A

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:16.677
PREVENTION OUTSIDE OF THE

01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:18.245
SCHOOLS AS A PREVENTION WITHIN

01:45:18.311 --> 01:45:19.613
THE SCHOOLS AND THEN YOU

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.914
CERTAINLY HAVE A TREATMENT.

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:22.616
PROVIDER CAPACITY SO I THINK WE

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:24.051
HAVE IN THE MEETINGS AND

01:45:24.117 --> 01:45:25.085
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD

01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:28.455
HAVE BEEN MORE IN A RECEPTIVE

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:30.257
TELL US YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:31.491
THOUGHTS --

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:33.593
I CERTAINLY WOULD AGREE WITH

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.228
BOTH THE ELLIE OWES RIGHT UP AS

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:37.998
WELL AS THE SOME OF THE

01:45:38.065 --> 01:45:39.166
STAKEHOLDERS.

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:40.701
PERSPECTIVES ON LEARNING LESSONS

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:42.402
AROUND OTHER TYPES OF VOLATILE

01:45:42.469 --> 01:45:43.770
FUNDS SOURCES SO WE ALSO

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:44.805
ADMINISTER THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:46.640
SERVICES ACT WE ALSO ADMINISTER

01:45:46.707 --> 01:45:48.875
PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WE ALSO.

01:45:48.942 --> 01:45:50.343
HAVE A DEAF A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:51.712
VOLATILE FUND SOURCES THAT ARE

01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:53.413
NOT NECESSARILY TIED TO THE

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.449
MEDICAID PROGRAM AND I WOULD

01:45:55.515 --> 01:45:57.184
AGREE THAT A LOT OF THOSE

01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:58.385
LESSONS THAT WERE NOTED IN THE

01:45:58.452 --> 01:45:59.486
MATERIALS.

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:00.954
ARE CERTAINLY THINGS THAT WE

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:03.256
OURSELVES HAVE BOTH AS SEEN IN

01:46:03.323 --> 01:46:04.591
AGREED WITH AND I THINK THAT ALL

01:46:04.658 --> 01:46:06.059
KIND OF INFORMS.

01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:07.394
THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:08.862
DEVELOPING FOR YOU KNOW FOR

01:46:08.929 --> 01:46:10.397

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:17.003
I I LET MY COLLEAGUE STEPHANIE

01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:18.538

01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:20.407
WE WOULD WE WOULD AGREE THAT THE

01:46:20.474 --> 01:46:22.209
DEPARTMENTS LOOKING AT THIS FROM

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:23.176
THE PERSPECTIVE WHAT WHERE ARE

01:46:23.243 --> 01:46:24.578

01:46:24.644 --> 01:46:26.580
HOW WE'RE GONNA GET THERE WHAT
