IT'S CRITICAL TO MEETING OUR EXISTING CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY GOALS. HOWEVER THE STATE LACKS A COORDINATED STRATEGY AND FUNDING PLAN TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFICIAL RE USE OF THESE ORGANIC MATERIALS. BENEFICIAL RE USE OF SUCH AS COMPOST BIO ENERGY OR SOIL AMENDMENTS CAN SUPPORT NET CARBON EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMICAL BENEFITS. A STRATEGIC PLAN ON ORGANIC WASTE MANAGEMENT WILL PROVIDE LONG TERM TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL END DATE INFORM RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO SUPPORT INCENTIVIZE THE BENEFICIAL RE USE OF ORGANIC WASTE. IT WILL CONSIDER AND BALANCE THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPOSED TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION INCLUDING WILDFIRE SMOKE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OUR NICK LAPIS FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND JULIA LEVIN FROM CALIFORNIA BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE LET THAT SUPPORT WITNESSES ON. MORNING THIS CYNICAL OFFICE OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE- THIS BILL HAS BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE NEXT PASSED WITH A UNANIMOUS VOTE SO I WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT IT BASICALLY ALL IT DOES IS TELL THE STATE TO DEVELOP. A CROSS SECTOR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR AGAMIC VOICE YES WE HAVE A PRETTY DECENT PLAN FOR FORGIVENESS FOR WAYS TO WASTE UNDER- SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT THERE'S NO COORDINATION BETWEEN THAT MATERIAL AND AGRICULTURAL MATERIAL PROPERTY TO USE YOUR BIO SOLIDS FOR SHE WASTE. AND EACH OF THOSE HAS FOUND REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT OWN- TARGET THE TERMS LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS- AND ALL THIS BILL SIZES LET'S COORDINATE THOSE LET'S SEE IF WE CAN MANAGE AND TOGETHER LET'S SEE IF WE CAN. BUILD HEALTHY SOILS AND USE THOSE PRODUCTS AND OFFICIALLY- INSTEAD OF. DEALING WITH ALL OF THEM ASILO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THIS IS SURELY A LETTER WITH A BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WILL BE KEPT CALIFORNIA GENERATES MILLIONS OF TONS OF ORGANIC WASTE A YEAR AND MOST OF THAT WASTE CURRENTLY IS BURNED EITHER IN WILDFIRES OR CONTROLLED BURNS OR ITS LANDFILLS FOURTH LEFT TO DECOMPOSE AND ALL OF THESE ARE SOURCES A SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS THE MOST DAMAGING THE FOR THE CLIMATE. THEY'RE ALSO LARGE SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION AND WATER POLLUTION AB TEN EIGHTY SIX WITH XCELERATED TRANSITIONED TO BENEFICIAL RE USE OF THIS ORGANIC WASTE AND WILL HELP US ACHIEVE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY WHERE INSTEAD OF THINKING OF THIS MATERIAL AS WASTE IT BECOMES THE SOURCE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ORGANIC SOIL AMENDMENTS AND OTHER BENEFICIAL PRODUCTS IT WILL ALSO HELP TO CREATE JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR CURRY FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND URGE THE COMMITTEE.

PUBLIC PARKS IN AND AROUND URBAN AREAS ARE CRUCIAL FOR BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE CLEAR BOTH THE NEED FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SPACES. AS WELL AS THE SEVERE LACK OF ACCESS MANY OF OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE. RESIDENTS AND UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS FRESNO AND MADERA COUNTIES FACED SUCH A PREDICAMENT. THANKFULLY THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER VALLEY CONSERVANCY'S MISSION TO ACQUIRE LANDS ALONG THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER TO CONSERVE VALUABLE HABITAT AND DEVELOP THESE LANDS FOR THE PUBLIC'S BENEFIT IS A CURATOR THIS LACK OF ACCESS. HOWEVER TO PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT TO ALL IT IS IMPORTANT THAT DIVERSE AND MARGINALIZED VOICES AND PERSPECTIVES HELP GUIDE THE DECISIONS OF THE CONSERVANCY IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER.

MISTER MATHIS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK ON THE SAN JOAQUIN- CONSERVANCY EIGHT AS A COLLEGE STUDENT AT FRESNO STATE GO DAWGS- SPENT SOME TIME DOING RIVER CLEANUP IN THOSE THINGS- BUT MR AMIN I. BRUGADA ASK YOU- ONE ON THE APPOINTMENTS WHAT WHAT IS THE PROCESS YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE- I KNOW A LOT OF US DID- KIND OF CONCERNED WHEN WE'RE ALLOWING THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE APPOINTMENTS IN LOCAL AREAS- VERSUS THE LOCALS- DOING THAT'S WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR THIS WERE YOU LOOKING AT IS THEIR CRITERIA- TO THESE APPOINTMENTS- WOULD YOU INDULGE OF SOME AND I HAVE A FEW OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. SURE WE ARE TRYING TO WITH THESE TWO NEW SEATS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE BRINGING A BROAD AND DIVERSE AND CULTURALLY- MORE APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION ON TO THE BOARD CURRENTLY WE DO NOT HAVE A DESIGNATED SEATS FOR OUR NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES AND- SINCE THEY WERE THE ORIGINAL STEWARDS FOR THESE LANDS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO HAVE A SEAT TEND TO SAY AND HOW WE PRESERVE AND CONTINUE THESE LANDS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED HOW WE CAN HAVE A SOCIAL JUSTICE SEATS SOMEONE WHO CAN MAKE SURE THAT WERE TAKING CARE OF THE LANDS AS WELL WE TRY TO IDENTIFY THOSE TWO SEATS AS WELL AS TO BRING CONSISTENCIES ACROSS CONSERVANCIES SO THAT WE HAVE SIMILAR STATUTES IN THE BANKING ACT HI COMMITMENTS THAT WE MADE TO THE I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE FOR THE SEATS AND I EXPRESSIONIST BACK THE ADDING THE- THE TRAVEL PORTION TO IT- BUT THAT MY BIGGER QUESTION IS WHY HAVE THE GOVERNOR. APPOINT THE SEAT VERSUS HAVING THE- CURRENT COMMITTEE- LOOK AT THAT APPOINTMENT PROCESS VERSUS THE GOVERNOR WHY TAKE THAT ROUTE- JUST AS WE HAVE TALKED WITH THE COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I WILL SAY THAT THIS ORIGINAL CONSERVANCY WAS STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO. AND SINCE WERE NOW COMING UP ON NEARLY THIRTY YEARS THAT THIS CONSERVANCY HAS BEEN- IN STATUTE I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME RESULTS ALSO THAT THE BROADER PUBLIC CONCERN. TO REALIZE THE POTENTIAL AND ACCESS THAT YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY. NOW MY CONCERN IS THAT THE- LAW IS PICKING VERSES THE GOVERNOR PICKING. ON IS OBVIOUSLY A CONCERN- FOR THAT PROCESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU. IN AN OBVIOUSLY IS LEGISLATORS WE UNDERSTAND THIS BUT FOR THE FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD AND SO THE PUBLIC LISTENING AND OBSERVING- CAN YOU EXPLAIN- WHY THE SWITCH. FOR THE- BAGLEY KEENE OPEN MEETING ACT RATHER THAN THE BROWN ACT- AND WHY THAT SWITCH IS NEEDED. JUST JUST FOR THE RECORD FOR THOSE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS SO THEY CAN HEAR PUBLICLY CONSERVANCIES ARE STATE AGENCIES. AND CURRENTLY ALL CONSERVANCY'S EXCEPT FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY CONDUCT BUSINESS UNDER THE BAGLEY KEENE OPEN MEETING ACT WHETHER OR NOT EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE ESTABLISHING ACT. AS BAGLEY KEENE PROCEDURES GOVERN STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS IT IS SENSIBLE TO RECLASSIFY THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY UNDER THESE PROVISIONS. SOMEWHAT BOTH THE PUBLIC SEE WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE THEY WOULD SEE IN THAT. FROM FROM A PUBLIC PERSPECTIVE FOR SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THIS WE'RE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAILS TO YOUR OFFICE ON AYE I KNOW I'M JUST SAYING FOR THE PUBLIC. I GET IT BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAILS. FANTASTIC THANK YOU.

NEXT UP WE HAVE AB TWENTY ONE I'M BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER REBEKAH BAUR CAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE HARD WORK ON THIS BILL IN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OFFICE- WOULD MAKE CLEAR OF ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TODAY WHICH I HAD A RIGHT TO CURE. AND CLARIFY AND THE INTENT OF THE PENALTIES COLLECTED AND WHERE THEY WILL GO AT THESE AMENDMENTS MAKE THE BILL STRONGER AND GET US TO WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO WHICH IS PREVENTION. OF WILDFIRES. TODAY I AM PRESENTING AB TWENTY ONE A BILL THAT AIMS TO PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS BY ENTERING PROACTIVE INSPECTION OF ELECTRICAL LINES FOR DANGEROUS OVERGROWN VEGETATION OR OVERHANGING TREE BRANCHES. OUR STATE FACES DIRE FIRE RISKS FIVE OF THE SIX LARGEST WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY HAPPENED IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE LAST YEAR WE ENTERED NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED WILDFIRES BURNING OVER FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES IN KILLING THIRTY THREE PEOPLE. THIS HEIGHTENED RISK OF FIRE IS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ONLY EXACERBATED. BY THE DECADES THE VEGETATION OF MISMANAGEMENT BY THE I. O. U.'S. WE NEED TO PUT SAFETY BEFORE PROFITS AND IN THE FACE OF THIS CRISIS WE HAVE TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT OF THE REGULATIONS ALREADY ON THE BOX. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CAMPFIRE DECIMATED THE TOWN OF PARADISE TRAGICALLY KILLING EIGHTY SIX PEOPLE THE FIRE WAS CALLS CAUSED BY FAULTY TRANSMISSION LINES IGNITED BY OVERGROWN VEGETATION NEARBY. THE DESTRUCTION AND LOSS OF LIFE IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE AND MANY OTHERS FORCED CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST I. O. U. P. JEANNIE TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY A SECOND TIME. DURING THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN A COURT APPOINTED MONITOR- THE JUDGE ALSO PUT APPOINTED IN THE- CASE RELATING TO THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION NOTICED HUNDREDS OF INSTANCES WHERE PG&amp;E CONTRACTORS HAD FAILED TO TREAT TREES THAT POSE POTENTIAL WILDFIRE RISKS. HE REPORTED THAT THE INSPECTIONS AND COVERED SUBSTANTIAL RECORD KEEPING ISSUES AS WELL TO THE ID'S CREDIT SOME OF THIS APPEARED TO BE A FAILURE. OF RECORD KEEPING AND THE INDIVIDUALS TASKED WITH MAINTAINING THE LINES HAD FAILED TO DO SO DESPITE REPORTING THEY HAD. AND THIS JUST HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND THAT ARE LOOKING AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES ENSURING THE VEGETATION IS MANAGEMENT IS HAPPENING AND THAT WE ARE SAFE FROM THIS RISK AS IT RELATES TO WILD FIRES. I KNOW MANY OF YOU PROBABLY SAW THE REPORT I SAW JUST WEEKS AGO ON THE TOXIC NATURE OF THE AIR THAT IS COMING OUT OF THESE WILDFIRES IT IS BOTH A RESTORE HEALTH RESTORE LIVES AND RESTORE COMMUNITIES AND ONE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE. NEED TO TAKE SERIOUSLY AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO. JOINING ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ON THE PHONE IS NOT BELT TRAUMA FROM THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND PATRICK COLLINS FROM THE NAPA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. MANAGER CAN RETURN TO THE- YES FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS MATTHEW BELTRAME WELL I'M AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY WITH- WHO SPONSORS THIS BELT WILDFIRES HAVE HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON CALIFORNIANS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. SEVEN OF THE STATE'S DEADLIEST FIRES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN KILLING OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE AND BURNING MILLIONS OF ACRES MANY OF THESE FIRE SHARE A COMMON TRAIT THEY WERE CAUSED BY ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT MOST TRAGIC EXAMPLE TO DATE OCCURRED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN A FIRE CAUSED BY POORLY MAINTAINED EQUIPMENT SWEPT THROUGH THE TOWN OF PARADISE KILLING OVER EIGHTY OF ITS RESIDENTS. FIRES OF THIS KIND COULD HAPPEN IN MANY COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING MY OWN ALAMEDA COUNTY WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OR THE LACK THEREOF IS A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM FOR EXAMPLE IS REALLY KEEN FOCUS OF THE FEDERAL JUDGE OVERSEEING P. GENIES CRIMINAL PROBATION HE FOUND IT P. GENIES PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WAS QUOTE DISMAL AND RECOMMENDED THAT MEASURES BE TAKEN BY STATE AUTHORITIES TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL PENALTIES FOR SUCH FAILURES. THIS BILL IS A SMALL STEP TOWARD MEETING THESE CONCERNS HE MAKES ANY PERSON WHO OWNS OR OPERATES ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION OR DISTRIBUTION LINES SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES FOR EITHER FAILING TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE VEGETATION CLEARANCE OR FOR CAUSING ANY WILDFIRE AS A RESULT OF THAT FILURE THE PENALTIES WOULD BE SET BY A JUDGE AFTER TRIAL TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A LIST OF FACTORS. THE POSSIBILITY OF CIVIL FINES OF THIS SORT ACCOMPLISHES TWO GOALS FIRST IT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL REAL WORLD RETURNS FOR OWNERS OF UTILITY LINES FOR FAILING TO ENGAGE. IN REQUIRED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. SECOND IT UP FOR LAW ENFORCED AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE TO ADDRESS IN ON PROBLEM ONE THAT NOT. FELONY CRIMINAL PROSECUTION WHICH IS THE ONLY REAL TOOL CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATE THE WORK DONE BY REGULATORS INCLUDING THE CPUC. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THESE EFFORTS MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF CIVIL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN ORDER TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT CALIFORNIANS IN THE YEARS TO COME. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- MY NAME IS PATRICK COLLINS SIMON DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE NAPA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY ALLISON HALEY. I AM TWENTY SEVENTEEN UP EXPERIENCED TWO MAJOR WILDFIRES ALISON PARTRICK WHICH STARTED BECAUSE THE KING TREES BLUE AND PG&amp;E POWER LINES WHICH IGNITED THE DRY FUELS BELOW. THE PARTRICK FIRE COMBINED WITH SEVERAL OTHER FIRES IN SONOMA COUNTY MANY OF WHICH WERE ALSO STARTED BY DYING TREES BLOWING IN A PDF POWER. THE FIRES BURNED SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF STRUCTURES. THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS MYSELF INCLUDED WERE EVACUATED DURING THE FIRES. IN SIX PEOPLE DIED IN THE ATLAS FIRE. AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION CAL FIRE FOR THE CASE OUR OFFICE FOR PROSECUTION. HOWEVER THE EXISTING REVENUE HAD A HAND BOTH CRIMINAL AND CIVIL WERE INSUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR THE USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTIONS REQUIRE PROOF BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT WHICH IS OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT STANDARD IN WILDFIRE CASES. LIKE THESE HELPFULLY CONVICTION ON THE MISDEMEANOR CHARGES AGAINST THE CORPORATE ENTITY IN THIS CASE P. JEANNIE. A LITTLE PUNISHMENT AN EXISTING CIVIL REMEDIES ARE LIMITED TO AN UNFAIR COMPETITION ACTION WHICH SET THE MAXIMUM CIVIL PENALTIES TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER VIOLATION. THE CURRENT BILL PROVIDES A TOOL THAT WE WISH WE HAD HAD WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER AND HOW TO PROSECUTE THESE VIOLATIONS DURING FIRES. I PROVIDE THE MIDDLE PASSED THE STYLISH IS DETERRENCE IMPLEMENTS ADEQUATE PENALTIES AND IN PARTICULAR. THE PENALTY OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS UP TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ACRE OF LAND BURN AS A RESULT OF THE VIOLATION OF TITLE. IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PATROL AND MONITOR POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS PRIOR TO A FIRE MAN AFTER FIRE CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH HOW LONG THE VIOLATIONS GOING ON PRIOR TO THE FIRE. IN FAIRNESS DEFENDANTS THE BILL GIVES THE COURT THE DISCRETION TO TAKE IN ALL RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN DECIDING ON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF PENALTIES PROVIDE ALEUTIAN- AS MR BALL SHARMA SAID WE KNOWLEDGE APPRECIATE OR CAL FIRE IN CPUS. TPC DEERE THIS AREA TO MINISTRY TO OPPOSE VIOLATIONS BUT SOMETIMES. AS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CERTAIN VIOLATIONS NECESSITATE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT AND POTENTIALLY PROSECUTION. WE FILL THIS BILL WILL GIVE OUR OFFICE A TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO AFFECTED ACROSS THE STATE. SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IPHONE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU- NEXT STOP- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SCOTT WHAT'S YOUR BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF THE OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES AND THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. I WOULD SUBMIT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS BILL WOULD BE A VERY REASONABLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. HAD A PRETTY REDUCE FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT GIVEN WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DONE. ALREADY THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY ANY DANGERS MAILLET MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY. RESPOND TO LEGISLATION BY SENATOR DODD IN TWENTY NINETEEN S. B. TWO FORTY SEVEN WHICH COMPLETELY CHANGED THE COMPLIANCE PROCESS FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THIS IS CRITICAL FOR THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND IN THE OLD DAYS CONTRACTORS WORKING FOR PGD WOULD GO UP. VERY GRETED OF WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THEY WOULD PERFORM THE WORK THEY WOULD THEN INSPECT THEIR OWN WORK IN THE U. TOLD HE WOULD COME IN AND SPOT ON IT TO WORK. INTO FORTY SEVEN WE PROPOSED WITH CAL FIRE TAKE OVER THOSE COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS INSTEAD OF THE COMPANIES. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DO YOU TO DO INSTEAD BECAUSE QUALIFIER DIDN'T WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY. WAS TO HAVE THE P. YOU SEE SELECT INDEPENDENT EVALUATORS. EXPERTS SO NOW THE PROCESS IS THE COMPANY SUBMITS ITS WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN THE CLOSER IS EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW PROCESS OF THE COMMISSION BIG GO OUT AND EXECUTE THE PLAN AND THEN THEY HAVE TO SELECT EVALUATORS CHOSEN BY THE P. YOU SEE TO GO TO CERTIFY THAT THEY HAVE COMPLIED THAT'S WHY THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED IN ADDITION THE AUTHOR FAILED TO MENTION THE P. JEANNIE WAS FALLING. OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS BY THE P. YOU SEE IN BY THE FEDERAL COURT. FOR VIOLATIONS. SO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS KNOWING THIS IS UNNECESSARY IT'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE DEFINITION OF CONTROL OF THE PROPERTY. WOULD EXTEND TO MY MEMBERS PERFORMING THE WORK IN OVERSEEING THE WORK. SO I'M A CONTRACTOR GOES UP TO DO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT MY MEMBERS OVERSEE THE WORK IS FOREMAN AND SUPERINTENDENTS. SOME DA THE DOESN'T KNOW. SOMETHING FROM SHINE ALL COMES IN AND SAYS YOU DIDN'T DO A GOOD ENOUGH JOB AND IN MY MEMBERS GETTING FINED A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT AND WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO SUBMIT THE DATA POST HEARING. THEY'RE ONE OF THE COUNTIES THAT IS THE WORST. INDEED IN ISSUING WHAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PERMITS. IS A COUNTY OF ALAMEDA WE HAVE STACKS OF PERMITS RIGHT NOW WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION HAVE NOT APPROVED SO OUR CREWS CAN'T BE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW MAKING. ALAMEDA COUNTY SAFE FOR ALL OF THE ABOVE REASONS. THIS BILL IS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM THAT YOU WILL ADDRESSED TWO YEARS AGO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR WELCH- WE HAVE ONE MORE. WITNESS IN OPPOSITION BY PHONE OPERATOR CAN YOU PUT HIM ON THE LINE. YEAH YEAH IT IS ADAM SMITH SEVEN CALIFORNIA EDISON URGING HER NO VOTE ON AB TWENTY ONE AB TWENTY ONE WOULD UNDO THE CLARITY OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ENFORCEMENT CREATED BY S. B. NINE A ONE AB TEN FIFTY FOUR SB TWO FORTY SEVEN AND ONGOING REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. IT WOULD DO THAT BY GIVING A DUPLICATIVE AND UNNECESSARY ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND RATHER THAN ACCELERATING OR INCENTIVIZING UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THIS BILL WOULD INTERFERE WITH THAT EXISTING ENFORCEMENT STRUCTURE ESTABLISHED AND REINFORCED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AB TWENTY ONE DUPLICATIVE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM WOULD BE UNCOORDINATED WITH THE EXISTING EFFORTS OF OUR CORE REGULATIONS AND I THINK THAT YOU JUST HEARD OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS LEFT IN ME EVEN MORE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE BUILT A STRENGTHENED REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HOLD I'LL USE ACCOUNTABLE AB TWENTY ONE IS AN UNNECESSARY DEPARTURE FROM THE FRAMEWORK YOU WORKED SO HARD TO CREATE. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE ADDED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE PC BUDGET IN TWENTY TWENTY TO REVIEW AND ENFORCE UTILITY WILDFIRE WORK WHILE PART SIXTY DIVISION WHICH IS NOW PART OF THE PC IS ON TRACK MOVED OUT OF THE PC WHICH WE THINK WILL INCREASE IT INDEPENDENT AS AN AUDITOR ARE YOU VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THEY ARE THE ONES WALKING THE LINE. AND OFTEN SPOTTING ANY PROBLEMS SB NINE OH ONE YOU KNOW A COUPLE YEARS BACK ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF FINE IF I USE DON'T MEET EXPECTATIONS AND YOU KNOW I'LL USE HAVE ALREADY THE STRONGEST OF INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE TREES AND BRANCHES ARE APPROPRIATELY TRAINED. IF A NON CONFORMANCE DISCOUNT OF BECAUSE THE FIRE IS LIKELY UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY DAMAGES DIO YOU. RIDLEY IS ONLY ONE NOTCH ABOVE JUNK BOND STATUS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE URGENCY WITH WHICH WE ADDRESS THE MILLIONS OF TREES WE OVERSEE AND ON THAT FINAL YEAH THAT KIND OF FINAL POINT OF FINANCIAL STABILITY AB TWENTY ONE WITH UNDERMINE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS MADE BY CALIFORNIA POLICY NUMBER THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDED TO MAINTAIN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. IN THE UTILITIES FINANCIAL HELP AND OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IF THE STAFF BACK BUT IT IS A FACT WHEN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE TO ROADS. CUSTOMER COSTS INCREASE AND FOR THOSE REASONS. EDIT THEN URGES YOUR NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU- NEXT I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT TO ANY WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM. C. NINE DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES AT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY LOCATION. OKAY THERE ARE NONE OF THE OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR. A SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO. COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. TO BE JUST ONE MOMENT WHILE WE GATHER THE NUMBERS. NINE EIGHTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHRIS PATTERSON ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC IN OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED. THANK YOU. YOUR. NINE FIFTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING THIS IS NIKOLINA MANDATES GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU I DO ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. OKAY MISS FRIEDMAN. OKAY. THANK YOU I GUESS I WAS GOING TO ASK FOR MAYBE YOUR YOUR SPONSOR TO RESPOND TO THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS BUT I THINK RATHER THAN DOING THAT GIVEN THE KIND OF BREATH OF THE- CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES HERE THAT I'LL JUST SAY THAT I DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WORKABILITY OF THE SOLUTION THE NECESSITY OF IT AS WELL BUT I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY REALLY. IN RESERVE MY RIGHT TO NOT SUPPORT IT ON THE FLOOR- REALLY TO GIVE ALAMEDA A CHANCE TO MAYBE TALK TO THE OPPOSITION TO SEE IF SOMEHOW THEIR CONCERNS YOUR ALAMEDA'S CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED- IF THEIR SHORTCOMINGS WITH THE INSPECTION PROGRAM IS THEY SEE IT MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE I'LL USE OPPOSITION THEIR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY. KIND OF DO THIS PROGRAM IN THIS WAY. THANK YOU. MR FLOOR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS AND I GUESS MAYBE HOPEFULLY YOU CAN ANSWER THIS FOR IT BUT WHERE. AS YOU SEE WHERE THE HOLES WITH SI PC ON THEIR OVERSIGHT OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. YES I THINK THAT I AM THE PLACE IT IS BEEN MOST ILLUSTRATED BEYOND OBVIOUSLY THE FIRES DEATH AND DESTRUCTION THAT I TALK ABOUT OPENING WHAT IS THROUGH JUDGE ALSUP'S OWN OVERSIGHT OF AND P. JEANNIE SPECIFICALLY AND THE COURT ORDERED MONITORING THAT CASE IS GONE OUT AND SPOT CHECKED. THIS WORKED OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LINES SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SO IT IS HARD FOR ANY ONE ENTITY TO UNLESS WITHOUT MASSIVE RESOURCES DO THE PROPER OVERSIGHT AND SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS ENSURING THAT THEIR LOCAL INSPECTORS THIRTIES OFFICE WHO CAN DO THAT AND I WANT TO POINT OUT. AND HOPEFULLY THIS ALSO DRESSES MRS FRIEDMAN'S COMMENTS BUT ALSO SOME OF WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THE ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKING TODAY- DOES PROVIDE A RIGHT TO CURE AND INSTRUCTS THE DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A REASONABLE PATHWAY TO RATE TO CURIOUS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT COULD BE A DIFFERENT TIMELINE. POTENTIALLY NEED TO GET PERMITS. AND THAT TAKES TIME- BUT AT THE RIGHT TO CURE WAS DONE BECAUSE THE GOAL HERE IS PREVENTION. AND SO WHAT WE WANT IS LOCAL INSPECTORS TO COME IN AND SAY YOU HAVE A RISK HERE GO FIX IT I HAD. I WANT TO THANK THE I USE FOR ALL EXTENSIVELY MEETING WITH ME ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SAID TO ME IN OUR MEETING WAS THE MINUTE WE KNOW THERE'S A VIOLATION WE GO AND FIX IT. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT HERE. AND SO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOCAL INSPECTOR TO SEE A PROBLEM. NOTIFY THE I'LL USE AND THEN HAVE IT FIXED WHICH IF THEY DO IT THER ARE NO FINES AND THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT ACTION. IS THE GOAL. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD BE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR STREETS AND THE MORE INSPECTORS. THE MORE THIRTIES WE HAVE OUT THERE DOING THE WORK TO FIGURE OUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED THE SAFER COMMUNITIES WILL BE. I'M KIND OF ON THE- VEIN. LIKE THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT UTILITIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO ON. ON PRIVATE PROPERTY CERTAIN RIGHT AWAY JUST BUT THEY'RE GONNA BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND RELIABLE IF SOMETHING GOES DOWN ON ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. SO WHATARE WE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT. SOTHERE IS- LANGUAGE AND I CAN TURN IT TO MR BELTRAME WHO CAN SPEAK MORE AS TECHNICAL EXPERT AND I CAN BUT THERE IS LANGUAGE THAT DOES ADDRESS. THE RIGHT TO GO AND FIX ESPECIALLY HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS MISTER ABOUT COMEDY WANT OUT IN. THE FACE ON THE LINE FOR. I AM STARTING THANK YOU. THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY WITH RESPECT TO THAT ISSUE IS- THIS IS A QUESTION OF- IT IN MANY RESPECTS PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION IT BACK DISCRETIONARY EXERCISE IN THE RIDING OF DIFFERENT- CONTACTS IF IT IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR. THE MINISTRY TO REGISTER REASONS FOR A UTILITY TO CLEAR VEGETATION FROM A DISTRIBUTION OR POWER LINES THEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE THAT WE'RE GONNA BRING IT UP LIKE IF IT HAS ANY TEETH THAT ARE AS ANY MERIT- BUT WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE AND WE'RE NOT DONE. THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE WOULD- CONCEIVABLY TAKE ACTION PARTICULAR WORK RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL- WILDFIRE THE STATUE HAS BUILT INTO IT A NUMBER OF FACTORS FOR A JUDGE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AND I'M SURE THAT THE AN ABILITY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM IF THAT. DOES EXIST IS ONE OF THEM. YES I HAD JUST OF SUCH THE YES NO SO I TO BE ON WHAT HE JUST SAID WHICH ALSO IS. FOR THOSE THAT HAVE CONCERNS THE DA'S WILL NOT USE THE PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION AS DESCRIBED THERE IS ACTUALLY LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. IT SAYS THAT THE COURT IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DETERMINING A PENALTY- WHETHER. THE AFFECTED VIOLATION MAY BE MITIGATED SO. AND I WOULD LOVE IT IF MR WHICH COULD COME BACK UP AND- MAYBE ADDRESS THAT AS WELL MAKE. ON HIS CONCERNS. THANK YOU SCOTT WHICH ABOUT CALIFORNIA COALITION UNTIL EMPLOYEES. WHAT'S BEING MISSED HERE IN RELATIVE TO THAT QUESTION IS. THE BILL THAT WE SPONSORED THE DODD BILL WHICH CHAPTER IN TWENTY NINETEEN. SO THE ENTIRE REGIME OF FILING WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS IN HAVING THEM REVIEWED BY THE CAN THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WAS APPOINTED BY THE P. YOU SEE THAT WHOLE PROCESS JUST BEGAN IN TWENTY TWENTY. OKAY SO REALLY THIS YEAR'S THE FIRST YEAR WHERE THIS WHOLE REGIME THERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE CONFERENCE COMMITTEES ABOUT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND IN THE MIDST OF THAT BECAUSE SOME DA HAS A REALLY NEAT IDEA THEY'RE GOING TO THROW A BRAND NEW PROCESS INTO THAT WHOLE MIX. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER WHITE. MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR- MY THE SURE A LOT OF MISTER WOULD USE CONCERNS ON THIS- WE ALL WORKED VERY VERY HARD ON SETTING UP THE PROCESS THAT WE NOW HAVE- FRANKLY YEARS TO IRON THAT OUT AND EACH. WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT THINGS AND I UNDERSTAND AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WE UNDERSTAND NO. ALL POLITICS ARE LOCAL. BOY FOR THESE COMPANIES FOR THESE WORKERS TO GET INTO SOME OF THESE AREAS THEY HAVE TO GET THOSE COUNTY PERMITS. AND MY CONCERN WITH HOW THIS BILL HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE D. A.'S IN NOT TO SAY THERE'S VALENTYN HERE BUT THE COUNTY CAN LITERALLY HOLD BACK A PERMIT AND HAVE THE DIEGO WHEN INSTRUCTOR PROSECUTE PROCESS. HE IN IT TURNS INTO A MONEY SCHEME. FOR THE COUNT. BECAUSE THEY CAN BLOCK THE PERMIT AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE GOING TO DO THIS AND THAT IS MY CONCERN WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A PROCESS THAT THAT IS NOW STARTING TO BE IMPLEMENTED PLUS THE SIGHTING OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT GOING IN AND LOOKING AT IT AND IN ALL THE BAD BLOOD THAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS. WITH NOT GOING IN AND NOT CLEANING UP AND ALL OF THAT THAT IS. PART OF THE OLD SYSTEM THAT WE WORK SO HARD. THROUGH THE SENATE BILLS TO GET RID OF IT NOW WE HAVE A NEW SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD. I THINK WOULD BE WRONG OF US AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT WE WORKED REALLY HARD ON A PROCESS. WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO GIVE IT A CHANCE. TO WORK. AND FOR THAT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I WE'VE GOT TO SEE THIS PROCESS WE WORKED ON. ACTUALLY TAKE ROOT AND WORK. SO THE TIMING OF THIS I DON'T THINK IS NECESSARY- NO I RESPECT YOUR YOUR HEART TOGETHER SOLVE TO THIS THE WILDFIRES ARE ARE AN ISSUE THE AIR QUALITY IS AN ISSUE AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED BUT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THE PROCESS THAT WE ALREADY WORKED SO HARD ON IN NATURE THAT THAT WORKS IN IN IS MOVING. IN AN EXPEDITIOUS WAY. TO ENSURE WE'RE KNOCKING WILDFIRES IN DOING THAT DOING SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE REPETITIVE FEES. TO ME WHEN I LOOK AT IT AT THE AT THE END OF THE DAY. COME FROM ONE OF THE POOREST DISTRICTS IN OUR STATE I HAVE TO LOOK IS THIS GOING TO POSSIBLY DRIVE UP THE COST OF PEOPLE'S ENERGY BILLS OR IS IT GOING TO LOWER IT. IN THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN THE STATE IS THE COST OF LIVING. IN IF WE'RE INCREASING THE COST IN ANY WAY EVEN IF THAT'S NOT THE INTENT. THEN THERE'S- WE SHOULD BE DOING. IN AND FOR THAT I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS A- CHIEF SORTING. THANK YOU SO FIRST I WANT TO THANK THANK YOU FOR HAVING A PASSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I HAVE THAT PASSION TO THERE'S NOBODY IN IN IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT HAS HAD MORE EXPERIENCE OR CARES MORE ABOUT SOLVING THIS ISSUE- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME- MY CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. ARE YOU KNOW THERE IS A QUOTE UNQUOTE OUR COMMENT. ABOUT RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES. N. AND WHEN. A UTILITY GETS FINED THEY HAVE TO THERE IS THERE'S A JUDGE'S SAYS WELL ONE OF THESE RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES. SOME OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IN MY EXPERIENCE BOTH AS A CITY LEADER AND ALSO IN THE FIRE SERVICE. ARE THINGS THAT ARE WAY BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. AND THAT'S THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE CREATED IN THE STATE IN REGARDS TO OUR ENVIRONMENT. OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THAT CREATE HURDLES IN IN IMPEDIMENTS TO ACTUALLY GETTING- TO ADDRESSING THE VEGETATION ISSUE AND THE VEGETATION ISSUE IS. THE ONE THING THAT WE HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER. AS A CITY WE ARE UNABLE TO GET PERMITS TO BE ABLE TO CLEAR AWAY BRUSH AND IT ALMOST COST AS A NEIGHBORHOOD LAST YEAR. THAT PROCESS IS SO LONG. THAT OUR IS SO ONEROUS. THAT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T GO IN AND START FINING PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH A PROCESS THAT WE CREATED. I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY- MENTIONED THE INCENTIVE TO FIND. WHEN YOU CREATE A PROGRAM THAT DEPENDS ON FINDS PEOPLE GONNA WANNA GO OUT AND FINE. SO THEY CAN THEY CAN THEY CAN HAVE THEIR PROGRAM- THE COSTS. ARE GOING TO BE PASSED ON TO CUSTOMERS I REALIZED THAT. THAT THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THERE THAT SAYS HERE NOT THEY CAN'T PASS ALONG TO CUSTOMERS. BUT IF YOUR CHOICE IS GOING BROKE OR GOING PASSING ALONG I MEAN THAT'S BUSINESS THEY HAVE TO PASS ALONG TO CUSTOMERS THIS YEAR WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT A 20% INCREASE IN OUR ELECTRICAL RATES AND A LOT OF IT IS RELATED TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE STATE WITH THAT. THE REGULATIONS AND HOW THEY'RE BEING- FIND IN IN IN THE COST TO THOSE THOSE THOSE ENTITIES WE NEED TO PAVE THE WAY FOR THEM TO DO THEIR JOB SO THAT THEY WILL DO THEIR JOB THERE'S NOBODY IN THE UTILITY SPACE. THAT ONCE WILD FIRES TO CONTINUE. THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB. THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO DO THEIR JOB WE'VE CREATED REGULATIONS IN LAST FEW YEARS THAT MAY HELP THEM BUT LIKE MY COLLEAGUE WAS SAYING WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO DO THAT SO FOR NOW. AT THE END I'M NOT GOING TO BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF THIS- JUST FOR THOSE REASONS BUT I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU. TO CREATE THE SOLUTIONS THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE HELPFUL IN THE FUTURE TO DOING THIS SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT AND- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PASSION ON THE ISSUE. YEAH MR STONE. THANK YOU ONE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE WITH THIS BILL THOUGH I'M A CO AUTHOR BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WE NEED TO SOMETHING DRAMATIC HERE IS THIS OVER RELIANCE ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A DODGE BY SOME OF THE I. O. USE FOR YEARS TO NOT UPGRADE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT SAFE BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. IN THE FORESTS AND THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN ALONG THE LINES THAT THAT WILL LEAD TO FIRES AND IF THEY'RE NO USING AND UPGRADING THEIR SYSTEMS TO THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL CONTINUE REGARDLESS OF THE THIS OVER RELIANCE ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SO THAT'S THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HERE. BUT AS TO THE REST OF IT I WILL HAVE TO SAY. THAT HAVING BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS WITH OUR LOCAL I. O. U. TWO GREAT FRUSTRATION LOCALLY. AND WITH WITH REALLY ALL OF THE AGENCIES. I'M NOT SURE THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS GOING TO ADDRESS UP TO THIS POINT WE'VE DONE UP THIS POINT IS ACTUALLY GONNA DRESS ANY THESE ISSUES. BECAUSE AT LEAST THE I. O. U. IN MY AREA. IS NOT PAYING ATTENTION. THEY HAVE LONG HAD EASY ACCESS TO PROPERTIES BECAUSE OF RIGHTS OF WAY THEY GET UNDER THOSE PROPERTIES. AND THEY HAVE LONG. CUT MAJOR SWATHS EVEN OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF LANDED REASONABLE OBJECTIONS OF LANDOWNERS. LOCAL FIRE CALIFORNIA AND OTHERS. SERVE WITHOUT REGARD TO WHAT THE SITUATION IS. THERE THE IN THE CZ YOU FIRE IT THE RESPONSE HAS REALLY BAD VISIBLE THEY CLAIM THEIR CHALLENGES ARE RIGHTS OF ACCESS. WELL CALIFORNIA- YES FEMA THE COUNTY HAD NO PROBLEM GETTING RIGHTS OF ACCESS AND BUILT THOSE AGREEMENTS WHERE WAS THE LOCAL I. O. U. NOT TO BE SEEN. THEY'RE STILL HAVING NO PROBLEM GOING ON TO PEOPLE'S PROPERTY. LEAVING MATERIALS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE LEAVING. AND IN FACT CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION IN THE COUNTY HAVE HAVE ISSUED NOTICES OF VIOLATION AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE BAD ACTIVITY AND A BAD ACTOR. THAT THE AYE YOU YOU IS BEING. THEY'RE BRINGING IN THEIR THEIR UNDER THE NEW RULES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING IN FORSTER'S WELL THEY BRING FORESTERS FROM TEXAS IN NEW JERSEY AND ALL INTO A REDWOOD FOREST. NOW NO OFFENSE CITIES FORSTER'S BUT THEY DON'T OPERATE IN REDWOOD FORESTS SO ARE THEY MAKING. APPROPRIATE DECISIONS YES IT'S AN ARBORIST. YES IT'S SOME POTENTIALLY FORRESTER BUT SOMEBODY DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT AND HOW THOSE SYSTEMS FUNCTION. AND BY THE WAY THE FIRES TO BURN THROUGH BIG BASS AND OTHER PLACES BURNED IN WAYS THAT THE FORCE OF REALLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE DAY DEHYDRATION THE FOREST AND OTHER IMPACTS SO THOSE FORCED TO CHANGING. EVEN WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS HOW THOSE FOR CEMENT. SO PGNIG IS KIND OF CHECKING BOXES. BUT NOT BEING EFFECTIVE IN HOW THEY'RE MANAGING. THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND HOW THEY'RE ADDRESSING THEIR RESPONSE TO THE FORCE IN INTO THE FOUR STARS IT'S REALLY BEEN A VISIBLE THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER OF NOTICES OF VIOLATION OUT TO THEM THAT THEY'RE REFUSING TO DEAL. SO IF WE'RE GIVING SOME AUTHORITY TO LOCAL PROSECUTORS TO GO AFTER BAD ACTORS I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH THAT SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAVE TO WAKE UP. THE UTILITIES. TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR SYSTEMS A LOT BETTER ENDS IF WE'RE GOING TO. BEMOAN THE FACT IT RATES ARE GOING UP BECAUSE THE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE YEAH WE SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. BUT SHAREHOLDER CONFIDENCE AND UTILITY BOTTOM LINE. IS SOMETHING THAT IS DRIVING UP. SOME OF THE COSTS TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IS. THE SHOULD BE IN THIS AWFUL. ORGANIZATIONS AND NOT PRIVATELY OWNED BECAUSE THEN THOSE COSTS IN THOSE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE FOR SHAREHOLDER CONFIDENCE. APART MINDS WOULD BE OFF THE TABLE THAT BY DEFINITION WOULD BE CHEAPER FOR RATEPAYERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND GIVE US MORE DIRECT ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SO THE VALUES THEMSELVES ARE SAYING WHEN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. THEY'RE MAKING THE CASE TO NOT HAVE UTILITIES BEING RUN BY INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SAID THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS ON THE TABLE AS WE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE- ISSUES WITH WILDFIRES AND UNFORTUNATELY WAS TAKEN OFF BUT THAT IS A REAL SOLUTION THAT CALIFORNIA FOR BEING ABLE TO MANAGE ITS GREAT LONG TERM. AND KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO TAKE STEPS LIKE THAT TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT. ORGANIZATIONS THE RIGHT LEVELS OF RESPONSIBILITY ARE MANAGING THE GREAT SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND I THINK THERE NEEDS TO STILL BE A LOT MORE DONE TO RAINY AND SO VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. IN AGAIN ON THE GROUND IN SPITE OF ALL THE RHETORIC IN THIS ROOM IF YOU LOOK AT ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW. HOW THESE I'LL USER ACTING IN THE COMMUNITY I WILL TELL YOU NOTHING HAS CHANGED. CONTENTS ALL MOVED TO THE- PROTECT ACT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'VE GOT A MOTION. NOTICE AND CLOSING- IN IN RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER STONE LIKE I THINK THAT THERE IS. THERE'S THREE THINGS A SUSTAINED FIRE. IT OXYGEN. THE TECHNICIAN IN ITS FUEL. WHAT WE'RE TALKING TODAY ABOUT HIS IGNITION AND WHO IS MAY OR MAY NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT BUT ONCE THAT ONCE THAT IGNITION IS ON THE GROUND. I THINK IT CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED HOW IMPORTANT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THIS AT THAT POINT. BECAUSE AND THAT'S THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY THAT LOCAL PROPERTY OWNERS RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE ONCE THAT SPARK HITS THE- GROUND. IT'S OFF TO THE RACES AND I THINK THAT'S- WHERE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE AS A STATE WE AS A- AS A BODY HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL IS TO MAKE SURE. THAT ONCE THAT IGNITION NO MATTER WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. WHETHER IT'S LIGHTNING OR MAN MADE. ONES THAT SPARK HITS THE GROUND. WE GOT TO GET THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FIRE SERVICE THE OPPORTUNITY. AND THE ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB AND CATCH UP TO THEM SO I DO THINK VEGETATION MANAGEMENT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WELL. BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONTEXT. BECAUSE THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HOW WE MANAGE THE FORESTS WHAT WE ARE IN FACT TALKING ABOUT HERE WITH THIS MESS THIS VERY. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT QUESTION. IS THAT IGNITION CORRECT AND SO IF THERE WHICH IS WHY THEY THEY CUT LARGE SWATHS UNDERNEATH THEIR- THEIR LINES. A. N. BUT REFUSED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR LINES ARE USING APPROPRIATE MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S PARKING DOESN'T HAPPEN. AND SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF CLEARING BACK APPROPRIATELY NOT INAPPROPRIATELY WHICH IS WHAT THEY TENDED. BUT CLING BACK APPROPRIATELY BUT BUT REALLY WHAT IT IS MAKING INVESTMENTS. AND GROUND FAULT INTERRUPTERS IN FAST SWITCHES AND THINGS THAT THAT. WILL DE ENERGIZE THE LINE. BEFORE IT'S GOING TO. THAT SPARKED IT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT WITH THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF FIRES IS REALLY BEYOND THE QUESTION HERE. BECAUSE THAT'S A BIGGER QUESTION THAT THAT THE I'LL USE ARE NOT GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING. THE ENTIRE FOREST AND HOW THAT FIRE THAT MOVES THROUGH THE FOREST. WE ARE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE POINT OF IGNITION AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. FOR MANAGING THAT INTERACTION BETWEEN AND ENERGIZED LINE WHICH SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DE ENERGIZE MORE QUICKLY WORKS. NOT HAVE THAT SPARK BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE OF INSULATION BECAUSE OF OTHER THINGS. SO NOT HAVING THAT IGNITION IN IT BEYOND THAT. THAT'S REALLY THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS PARTICULAR QUESTIONS ON WHICH STATION AFTER. OF COURSE FIRST ON. THE WILL GO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THE ROBOTS DEBATE. HAS BROUGHT A RUN QUESTION IN MY MIND FOR THE AUTHOR GARCIA LANGUAGE. IS THERE A MECHANISM WITHIN THE LANGUAGE OF YOUR BILL. THAT SPECIFICALLY PER TAX UTILITIES IN THE CASE THAT THE COUNTY HAS NOT APPROVED THE PERMIT. SO IF THE I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN HELP IF THERE'S NOT A PERMIT THE LET HIM GO IN BECAUSE THE- YUP TELEVISION COUNTY- EVERYTHING'S BACKLOG. YOU KNOW SO I WANT TO ENSURE THAT. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET BEAT UP BECAUSE SOMEBODY DIDN'T SIGN OFF ON A PERMIT TO LET ME. SO I DON'T WANNA I WANNA MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T TURN INTO A PREDATORY PROCESS YEAH COUNTY LEVEL. YES IS THAT SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN IN THERE. TO PROTECT THEM FROM LIKE A LAZY CAL YES. PLEASE CALL THE COUNTIES IS THAT YES THINGS STAND IN THEIR WAY MISTER MATHIS ARE TRUSTED HERE- AND I MAY NOT BE THE ONLY THING RIGHT PERMITS IS ONLY ONE THING YOU MISTER FLOOR MENTIONED OTHER BARRIERS- MISTER SARATOGA AS WELL- AND YES SO IT IS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE COURTS ANALYSIS OF FINES AND FEES SO IF THE DA WERE TO BRING ACTION. THAT- WAS FOR LACK OF EDUCATION MANAGEMENT SUMMIT COULD MITIGATE THE COURT IS INSTRUCTED TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO FIND. ENEMY HELPER THAT'S THE BASIC DEFENSE TO ISSUE BEING BROUGHT UNDER SOMETHING LIKE THIS BY A DA IS IF THERE'S A MINISTERIAL OR IF THERE'S A GOVERNMENTAL ACTION. THAT THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE WOULD HAVE NEEDED. IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD THEN. THERE'S NO CASE YET MATHIS SALAS THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE IT'S JUST INSURING EVEN THE PROCESS OF THAT IS GOING TO COST THE UTILITY MORE MONEY. SO IT IT'S MAKING SURE IT'S VERY STAUNCH AND CLEAR THAT WE HAD D. A. CAN'T JUST BE LIKE WELL LET'S JUST DO THIS ANYWAY. WELL I WANT TO MAKE SURE THESE THINGS ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR MOVING FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO JUDICIARY. AND A LOT OF THE CONCERNS ARE ON THE JUDICIARY SIDE AND I BELIEVE MR SONG YOU'RE STILL ON JUDICIARY CORRECT SO. YEAH AND I DO I MEAN WHAT I AS I READ THE LANGUAGE I BELIEVE IT'S CLEAR BUT IF IT'S NOT WE'RE HAPPY CLEAR THAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WAS IS NOT A GOTCHA IT'S NOT EXCESSIVE FINES IT IS VERY MUCH GIVING THE UTILITIES. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CURE LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THERE IS A VIOLATION. ASKING THEM TO FIX IT GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX IT FOR ANY ACTION BE CAN BE TAKEN WHICH AGAIN. IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH EDISON THEY SAID THEY DO SO WE SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS- BUT- ENSURING THAT IF THEY DON'T. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT AND CORRECT- WHAT IS HAPPENING AND ENSURE THE LIVES ARE NOT LOST AND I WANT TO THINK AND MR SERETIDE AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THANK HIM FOR HIS COMMENTS AND I KNOW BOTH. YOU KNOW WE'VE SEVERAL PEOPLE HERE WHO SPENT THEIR CAREERS FIGHTING FIRES AND I'M PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS AND- OBVIOUSLY IS CRITICAL FOR ALL OF US THAT WE GET THIS WORK DONE- AND THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT THE DEVASTATION THAT OCCURS WHEN A FIRE HAPPENS- AS TO YOUR COMMENT MISTER MATHIS- ABOUT REPAIR COSTS I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT AND- MISTER WHICH MENTIONS THE- ENORMOUS FINES THAT COME OUT OF THESE FIRES THAT IN FACT. THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CURE AND HAVE PEOPLE PROVIDING THAT OPPORTUNITY. COULD SAVE THE I USE MONEY IF THEY DO THE WORK SO IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME. THAT GIVEN THE WAY THIS BILL AS AMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT- AMENDMENT IN THEIR WORK ON THAT. THIS COULD ACTUALLY REDUCE THE COST ON THE I USE RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL THESE FIRES WHAT HAPPENED. AND WE ARE FINDING THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR. THAT COUNTLESS PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED IN THE COMMUNITIES OF. THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED- SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. BUT OBVIOUSLY AS MR STONE POINTED OUT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS AND IT IS NOT. THIS IS NOT THE WHOLE SOLUTION AND I DON'T. CLAIM IT IS BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF IT- YOU KNOW. WE HAVE DONE WORK ON THIS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. BUT I'LL POINT OUT THAT JUST THIS WEEK. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DOG FIRE WAS CAUSED BY. A LACK OF EDUCATION MANAGEMENT FOUR PEOPLE KILLED FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS ACRES BURNED SO WE- WE HAVEN'T SOLVED THIS PROBLEM I THINK WE NEED TO. OWN THAT AND BE CLEAR ABOUT AND WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. AND THAT IS THE WORK THAT I'M TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY. SO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT FOR CARING SO MUCH ABOUT THIS ISSUE. OKAY DID WE HAVE MORE QUESTIONS. YES THE STARS. MANY A COMMON I KNOW THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND I'LL- THANK AND- THE BILL- WE ARE. I UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S HERE AND IT'S GOING TO DO JUST VERY WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT UTILITIES AND THE WORK THAT OUR CHURCH THERE HAS DONE- IN THIS SPACE AND WHEN WE THE WORK IS DONE AT A WAS NOT AT THE END OF THE WORKING DAY TO DO SO I DO AGREE THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I. UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPAND OUR TOOL KIT WITH WITH THIS BILL I TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL AND MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE ACCOUNTABLE OTHERS I APPRECIATE THAT THAT YOU'RE JUMPING INTO THE SPACE HERE LEADERSHIP IS NOT A QUESTION AS A MATTER OF ITS FOR YOU OR FOR SOMEBODY ELSE OF. WHY IT'S NOT GOING TO TELL THESE- WE'RE NOT HEARING IT IN UTILITY. SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE GERMANE TO THAT TOPIC. I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR RULES BUT I CAN SAY THAT IT IS IN PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE WHICH IS WHY IT'S BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE- AND- I KNOW THAT MR HOLDEN I HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS THINGS ON THE SAME PAGE IN THIS CONVERSATION AND- I WILL CONTINUE. TO ENGAGE HIM IN CARE DEEPLY ABOUT HIS WORK ON THIS AND- AS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN. PART OF MANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND GETTING YOU TO BE AND I KNOW HE SHARES. ALL OF OUR INTEREST IN ENSURING OR PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS FROM. ANY UTILITY PASSED WELFARE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR THERE ARE LOTS OF THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING- AB NINETY SIX THAT IS A BILL THAT WILL IMPOSE A LIEN ON WELL OPERATORS- TO RECOVER STATE COST THIS LEAN ON WELL OPERATORS CAN BE REMEDIATED BY THE- WELL OPERATORS IF THEY- TAKE ANY OF THE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS REMEDIATED PAID A FINE- INDEMNIFY THE BOND BUT IT CAN BE REMOVED- THERE ARE OVER FOUR THOUSAND IDLE WELLS- IN CALIFORNIA. WHO BUT THERE ARE OVER FOUR THOUSAND IDLE WELLS IN CALIFORNIA THAT OVER SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN UNPAID FEES THAT ARE OUT THERE OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY OF THOSE IDLE WELLS ARE IN MY DISTRICT ALONE- ONE THIRD OF THOSE IDLE WELLS- CAL GEMS IS NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHO THE OPERATOR IS OR OR CONTACT THE OPERATOR. THEY'RE POTENTIALLY ORPHANED WELLS AN ORPHAN WELLS HAVE POSED A REAL LIABILITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO LEAK GAS- AND- FUGITIVE- ADMISSIONS IN ADDITION TO THAT AS THE WORLD TRANSITIONS AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS. THE POTENTIAL RISK FOR MORE ABANDONED AND ORPHANED WELLS INCREASES WE NEED STRONGER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SO THAT THE RESPONSIBLE ACTORS ARE NOT TARNISHED BY THE AIR RESPONSIBLE ACTORS. IN HOW THEY HANDLE- THERE IDLE WELLS I'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS- AND TRYING TO AND I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S COOPERATION AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BILL AND I. AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO ADDRESS THE FEW REMAININGISSUES THAT ARE OUT THERE I'M VERY HAPPY THAT THERE ARE TWO KNOWLEDGEABLE WITNESSES- THAT HAVE DECIDED TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY ALSO.

THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DAMOND LIKE I MEAN I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL OR NRDC WE SUPPORT AB EIGHT NINETY SIX WHICH WOULD GIVE THE STATE OIL AND GAS REGULATOR CAL GEM ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO HOLD FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE IMPACTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS. THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE CAL GEMS PUT A LIEN ON PROPERTY AND OPERATORS WELL DURING AN UNSAFE CONDITION OR IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING THEIR TO IMPOSE FEES OUR COMPANY DECLARES BANKRUPTCY AND TRIES TO LEAVE THE STATE HOLDING THE BAG SALINAS ALREADY INEFFECTIVE COMMONSENSE TOOL THAT FRANKLY CONTENT ALREADY SHOULD HAVE HAD IN THIS TOOLBOX. THE BILL WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH A COLLECTIONS UNIT TO COLLECT UNPAID I DON'T WELL FEES AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED WHEN A WELL HAS BEEN DESERTED ORDER TO BE PLUGGED AND ABANDONED AGAIN THIS IS A COMMONSENSE TOOL THAT CAN INCREASE COMPLIANCE AND SHOULD BE INTELLIGENCE ARSENAL. THESE MEASURES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY SHORE UP CALCIUM TO FLORIDA WITH REGARD TO NON COMPLIANT WELL OPERATORS AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF WHERE THIS COULD BE HELPFUL IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR HELLO JIM ISSUED AN ORDER TO ALLEN CO ENERGY TO PLUGGING ABANDONED WELLS AT ITS ST JAMES STILL SITE IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES. THIS SITE IS ADJACENT TO HOMES CHURCHES BUSINESSES AND A SCHOOL FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN AND CAL GEMS ORDER DETAIL THAT THE THEORY RATING CONDITION OF THE WILD AND EVIDENCE OF MULTIPLE GAS LEAKS. CAL JIM ALSO HAD PREVIOUSLY ASKED FOR INFORMATION FROM THE OPERATOR TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROJECT COULD WOULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO LIFE HEALTH PROPERTY FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND YET SEVERAL MONTHS LATER THE OPERATOR STILL HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE THIS DATA AND INFORMATION TO THE AGENCY AND ALSO. HAS FAILED TO PAY ITS IDLE WEALTHY. BUT NEXT TO ALLEN CO SITE AND OTHER WELL. AND THE- ALL COULD BENEFIT FROM THE- IN THIS BILL. THIRTY SECONDS NRDC SUPPORTS AB EIGHT NINETY SIX AND RESPECT RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH NEXT UP WE HAVE. TERRA MESSING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER BY THE PHONE. GOOD MORNING HEARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS I NEED THIS TERM MESSING AND I AM A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER. EDC IS A PUBLIC INTEREST LAW FIRM THAT PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT IN SANTA BARBARA VENTURA AND FAMILIES OBISPO COUNTY. EDT SUPPORT AB EIGHT NINE SIX. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT OIL AND GAS PRODUCER'S WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. ENTERED INTO BANKRUPTCY. THIRTY SIX PRODUCERS WITH AROUND FIFTY ONE BILLION AND THAT FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF LAST YEAR. INCLUDING ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST OIL AND GAS OPERATORS. CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RISK THAT A SINGLE BANKRUPTCY COULD POSE TO THE STATE. THE COMPANY HAD MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT. ALONG WITH AN INVENTORY OF THOUSANDS OF IDYLLWILD. WELL DESERTED BY INSOLVENT OPERATORS BECOME PORTION WILD PORCH THE STATE MAY BECOME RESPONSIBLE. A TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL COST TO PLUG ALL ACTION ON A WILL BE CALIFORNIA. WOULD BE ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. THIS WILL PROVIDE CALCIUM WITH THE TOOL TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND TAXPAYERS BY MANAGING THE DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS. SHOULD AN OPERATOR FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY THE BUILDING AUTHORITY WOULD YOU GIVE CALDERON HEIGHTENED PRIORITY FOR REPAYMENT. THE BILL WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH UNIT TO COLLECT UNPAID IDYLLWILD FEES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN OPERATORS FAILED TO PAY FEES FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WELL. THIS UNIT PROVIDES ANOTHER MECHANISM TO ADDRESS THE GROWING NUMBER OF UNPAID FEES. I'M THREE TWELVE ALL THREATENED CLEAN AIR WATER AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS LIVE WITHIN SIX HUNDRED FEET OF UNPLUG WHILE. WITHOUT YOU KNOW BLACK AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE LIVING NEARBY AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION AS A WHOLE FIFTEEN SECONDS OIL WELLS ARE NONE OF IT. WELL WALDRON UNTIL.

AND CAL JIM CURRENTLY HAS A 20% STAFF VACANCY RATE SO THEY HAVE LOTS OF POSITIONS AVAILABLE TO AUGMENT THEIR COLLECTION FUNCTION. FOR MISTER BENNETT'S BILL. BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME TECHNICAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEAD AUTHORITY IN THE BILL CALCIUM ALREADY DOES HAVE LEAD AUTHORITY AND PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION THIRTY FOUR TWENTY THREE SO WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW THIS BILL WOULD MODIFY CURRENTLY AUTHORITY.

GOOD MORNING- MADAM CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I'D LIKE TO THINK YOU'RE COMMITTEE AND STUFF FOR WORK ON THE BELT AB SIXTY SIX WILL PROVIDE SCRIPT INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY WITH A TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN STATE FUNDING. FOR RESEARCH TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BLUFF COLLAPSED EARLY WARNING NOTIFICATION SYSTEM TO IMPROVE BEACH SAFETY AND PREVENT FURTHER FUTURE FATALITIES EPISODIC LOVE FAILURES HAVE CAUSED HUMAN INJURY IN SEVERAL DEATHS IN RECENT YEARS ON JULY THIRD TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A WOMAN DIED AFTER SHE FELL THE HUNDRED FIFTY FEET FROM THE SEASIDE BLUFF IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WHEN THE GROUND BENEATH HER CRUMBLED THE CLIFF HAVE BEEN BATTERED BY WINTER STORMS AND COLLAPSED. ON FEBRUARY TWO TWENTY NINETEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO WOMAN OUR DOG WERE RESCUED ANOTHER WOMAN REMAIN TRAPPED AFTER THE EDGE OF A CLIFF AT FORT FUNSTON COLLAPSED ON TOP OF THEM HEARING ONE VICTIM UNDER TONS OF DIRT THE TRAP WOMAN'S BODY WAS NEVER RECOVERED. ON AUGUST TWENTY NINETEEN THREE PEOPLE WERE FATALLY CRASHED WHEN A BLUFF CLASS IN EDIT INFINITIVES BEACH IN MY HOMETOWN THE VICTIMS ARE PART OF A LARGE FAMILY GATHERING THAT ANY AND HAVE IT BOTH COST OF JUST A FEW MINUTES EARLIER THE DEATH. TOLL WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER INCLUDED CHILDREN. IN A TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY- CLUB. THREAD EXPENSE CLIFTON OF. THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING HIGHWAYS RAILWAYS WASTE WATER OIL NATURAL GAS AND NUCLEAR FACILITIES. UNIVERSITIES AND SEVERAL CRITICAL MILITARY BASES AND NUMEROUS STATE BEACHES AND PARKS. RESEMBLE OF FAILURES OF THE CITY OF DEL MAR JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THREATEN A BLUFF TOP REAL RIGHT YOU HAVE RESULTED IN MULTIPLE CLOSURES OF THE SECOND BUSIEST REAL QUARTER IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. IMPACTING COMMUTERS FREIGHT TRANSPORT AND THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO. AS CONCERT AT AS CONCERNING BLOOD FIGURES ARE PROJECTED TO HAPPEN MORE OFTEN. U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY SCIENTISTS HAVE FORECASTED THAT BECAUSE OF SEA LEVEL RISE OUR COASTLINE COULD RECEIVE BY MORE THAN A HUNDRED FEET THIRTY FEET. BY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED IF THE LEVELS KEEP RISING TO THE LOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. WHAT IS MISSING RIGHT NOW IS UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENCE AROUND WHITE BLUFFS REAL. UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS THE DRIVE BUS FOR YEARS TRIGGERING MECHANISMS. MAGNITUDE OF ROSHEN AND TIMING OF CLOUGH'S IS ESSENTIAL FOR COASTAL MANAGEMENT AND BUILDING RESILIENT AND SAFE COMMUNITIES. AB SIXTY SIX OF THE FOR IS THE FIRST STEP IN CREATING EARLY MORNING NOTIFICATION SYSTEM MUCH LIKE WE HAVE FOR EARTHQUAKES. THE RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON THE DEL MAR BLUFFS WHERE I MENTIONED THE REAL I COSTS JUST RECENTLY HAPPENED. AS WELL AS BEACONS BEACH AN ACTIVE LANDSLIDE AREA IN ENCINITAS. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE SCIENCE STATEWIDE TO DEVELOP IN FACE TO THE EARLY WARNING NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE EVENTUALLY WILL HAVE WARNINGS FOR BLOOD FAILURES ON OUR WEATHER APPS MUCH LIKE WE DO FOR HIGH WIND ADVISORY. FLOODING OR HIGH SURF ADVISORIES. THIS INFORMATION IS CRITICAL TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER IN THE FACE OF SEA LEVEL RISE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY ARE MARK SOME BURKE. RESEARCH GEOPHYSICIST FROM THE INSTITUTE OF GEOPHYSICS AND PLANETARY PHYSICS SCRIPTS. AND COUNCIL MEMBER DWIGHT WORDEN FROM THE CITY OF DEL MAR. THANK YOU. IF WE CAN OPEN UP LINES FOR WITNESSES. HI THIS IS MARK SAMBERG SCRIPTS OCEANOGRAPHY- THANK YOU CHAIR RIVAS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANKS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH FERNER DO SING THIS BILL THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE RESEARCH ON THE DYNAMICS OF CLIFF COLLAPSE ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST LINES. WITH FUNDING FROM THE STATE PARKS OCEANOGRAPHY PROGRAM MY COLLEAGUE AT SCRIPTS DR ADAM YOUNG HAS BEEN SERVING THE CLIPS BETWEEN SAN DIEGO IN OCEANSIDE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. USING LIDAR A SYSTEM THAT SCANS THE CLIFFS WITH A LASER CREATING HIGHLY DETAILED SPATIAL MAPS WITH RESOLUTION MEASURED IN INCHES. TO LEARN WHERE AND HOW OFTEN CLIP FAILURES OCCUR- THIS TO TEXT THE SMALL HARDLY NOTICEABLE ROCKFALLS AND ALSO OF COURSE THE MAJOR COLLAPSES WHICH THREATEN LIVES AND PROPERTY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S COASTLINE. WITH FUNDING FROM THIS BILL WE WOULD AIM TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES LEADING UP THE CLIFF FAILURES BY DOING TWO THINGS FIRST WE WILL ACCELERATE THE COLLECTION OF THE SLIDER DATA ALLOWING MORE FREQUENT AND HIGHER RESOLUTION SCANS OF THE CLIFFS. AND ASSIMILATE THESE MEASUREMENTS INTO A GROWING HISTORICAL DATA BASE TO LEARN WHERE AND WHEN FAILURES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND WHERE THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. A KEY GOAL IS TO FIND OUT OF ANY SIGNATURE EXISTS THAT COULD FORETELL OF HEIGHTENED RISK IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS. SECONDLY WE WOULDN'T INSTRUMENT KEY SITES WITH GEOTECHNICAL MONITORING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED HERE AT SCRIPTS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. THAT CAN DETECT INFINITESIMAL DEFORMATIONS OF THE ROCKS. AGAIN OUR GOAL IS TO LEARN HOW THE FORMATIONS ARE IMPACTED BY TIDES LARGE SURFACE GROUNDWATER AND RAINFALL. TO SEE IF WE CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SIGNALS EXIST THAT CAN FORECAST WHERE AND WHEN. AN INCREASE RISK FOR COLLAPSE IS DEVELOPING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING THIS IS DWIGHT WORDEN I'M THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF THE CITY OF DELMARVA SMALL BEACH TOWN OF FOUR THOUSAND RESIDENTS BUT WITH ABOUT THREE MILLION VISITORS A YEAR COMING TO OUR BEACH DELMAR HAS ONE OF THE MOST STUDIED BEACHES AND SEACLIFF SYSTEMS IN THE US WE'VE BEEN MONITORING ST MOVEMENTS CLIFF RETREAT STORM SURGE AND MORE FOR DECADES AND AS MENTIONED WE'VE BEEN A PRIMARY STUDY SITE FOR SCRIPTS WHICH WERE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM RIGHT NEXT DOOR. WE HAVE A STATE OF THE ART C. LEVEL RISE UP PLAN THAT WE'VE ADOPTED IN DEL MAR ADDRESSING RESILIENCY AND ADAPTATION WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT LONG TERM TRENDS INCLUDING CLIFFORD TREAT AND WHAT CAN MAKE THEM COLLAPSE WELL WE DON'T KNOW IS HOW TO IDENTIFY AREAS LIKELY TO COME DOWN NOW WE CAN'T TELL YOU IS IT SAFE TO LAY MY TOWEL ON THE BEACH IN THIS LOCATION. THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR LOCAL CITIES WE'VE HAD DEATHS AS MENTIONED IN THE CADIA DELMAR TORREY PINES AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE UNEXPECTED FROM CLIFFS FAILURES THAT WERE ARE NOT ABLE TO BE PROTECTED WE HAVE A RAILROAD AT RISK IN DEL MAR- IN IS- THE AUTHORS MENTIONED WITH SERVICE WAS STOPPED JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WHEN A MAJOR UNEXPECTED COLLAPSE OCCURRED. HAND SOLVED COASTAL ACT AND CHIEF EXISTING GENERAL PLANT LAW REQUIRES THAT CITIES LIKE DEL MAR THAT WE ALL STUDY AND PREPARE AND THAT- HAZARD ANALYSIS BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LAW AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE RESEARCH REPERTOIRE TO HELP THE CITY IDENTIFY WHAT'S AT RISK AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT AB SIXTY SIX COMPLIMENTS EXISTING LAW LOOKING AT LONG TERM SEA LEVEL RISE AND CLIMATE CHANGE BY ADDING CLIFF FAILURE HAZARDS AND WARNINGS. IN THE NEAR TERM LITERATURE RESEARCH SHOWS THERE ARE AT LEAST TWENTY NINE SYSTEM WORLDWIDE DOING THIS ALREADY UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NONE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE WOULDN'T BE STARTING AT GROUND ZERO BOTTOM LINE WE CAN TELL YOU THE LONG TERM DYNAMICS OF CLIFF RETREAT WITH PRETTY GOOD ACCURACY BUT NOT IF IT'S GOING TO FALL ON. YOU IF YOU VISIT THE BEACH OR OF THE TRAIN IS GOING OVER THE CLIFF IN THE NEAR. THIS WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL FUN TO TAKE US TO THE STEP TOWARDS. LIVES THERE'S NO ONE BETTER TO DO THAT SCRIPTS INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY. PLEASE SUPPORT AB SIXTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU- NEXT DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO.

TO DO A PILOT PROGRAM FOR JUST ONE PARTICULAR AREA- YOU KNOW THIS ALSO EXCLUDES OTHER AREAS LIKE BIG SIR- THAT WE KNOW HAS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS EVERY YEAR- I REALLY THINK IT WOULD BE WHO OF THE OF SAN DIEGO AND IN OF OTHERS TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN PARTNER WITH THOSE FEDERAL. PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING IS ACTUALLY GOING TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS- SO. I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY COMPARED TO THE- TWO POINT FIVE MILLION YOU'RE ASKING FOR FROM THE STATE- AN EXPRESSION WITH CALVIN AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO STATE RECOVERY ON IT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF IF. IF THEIR FANS ARE ALREADY DROPPING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY INTO THIS. WHAT CAN WE DO AT THE STATE LEVEL TO PARTNER WITH THEM TO USE THE RESEARCH THAT THEY THEY ARE ALREADY ON GOING AND DOING- TO FIND THOSE. STATE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIPS- CALIFORNIANS INVESTING THAT THE FUNDING SO. FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL NOT SUPPORT BUT I DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AT THANK YOU TO THE OTHERFOR- BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I KNOW OFTENTIMES- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE PLASTIC THAT COMES IN IN MY BAG WHEN I FORGET TIME AHEAD OF TIME THE PLASTIC. CYPRESSES THAT AND I APPRECIATE- YOUR EXPANSION OF THE ORIGINAL OF STRAW BILL I KNOW YOU BUILDING ON THAT TO INCLUDE DELIVERY PLATFORMS AND SO FORTH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE PREVIOUS BILL THAT YOU'RE BUILDING ON DIDN'T INCLUDE FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING AT ANY POINT TO LOOK AT AS WELL. THE INTENT IS FOR FOOD DELIVERY. SO IF- YOU'RE ORDERING THROUGH. AN APP LIKE YOU HEARD GRUBHUB- TESTIFY JUST NOW. IT'S THE IDEA THAT- YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE AN OPTION. WHETHER YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO- RECEIVE THAT PLASTIC- THE TITLE IN YOUR DELIVERY WILL CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THE DETAILS OF IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY AT THE RESTAURANT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING AS WELL. SO IF I ORDER MCDONALD'S TO GRAB THEM I WOULD BE TAKING CARE OF. THAT IS THE GOAL AND INTENT YES IT'S GREAT. TO BE ABLE TO OFFER YOU THE OPTION THANK YOU FOR THAT WORK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU- A OF. WHEN I FIRST READ YOUR BILL LIKE I THOUGHT. I LOVE THIS BILL ONLINE YOU KNOW WHAT I. WOULD LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR- BUT THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW I. OF HEARING THE SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT I HAPPEN TO HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW- AS THE CONCERNS FROM THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. MORE MAYBE MY OFFICE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. IF I DID DIE I'D LIKE TO. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT- YEAH I THINK YOUR BILL IS VERY TIMELY AND ONE OF THOSE. I'M SURE. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO. YOU KNOW GET MY FOOD TO TAKE OUT AND THINKING DANG I FORGOT TO TELL THEM DUE TO LEAVE THE TONSILS OUT- SO- ON THE BUDGET YOU KNOW WE JUST FALLING OVER MS GARCIA'S QUESTIONS SO. IF I GO TO A LOCAL A LOCAL RESTAURANT. AND I CAN I GET TAKE OUT- AND THEY HAVE THE UTENSILS AND THEIR- THIS BILL APPLIES TO. THE PLASTIC UTENSILS IF YOU ACTUALLY GO TO THE RESTAURANT AND PICK IT UP YOURSELF THAT'S RIGHT SO THOSE ARE THE DETAILS THAT WERE IRONING OUT WITH A CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION TO MAKE IT ONE IT'S AN OPTION FOR THE CONSUMER RIGHT TO AND IF YOU NEED THEM YOU SHOULD GET THEM BUT YOU SHOULDN'T JUST GET THEM AND THEN ENDS UP IN THE TRASH- IN YOUR- YOU KNOW SECRET SAUCE AND UTENSIL DRAWER IN YOUR KITCHEN- AND WORKING OUT THOSE DETAILS AND I RECOGNIZE THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF- RESTAURANTS SO THERE'S THAT TABLE SETTING RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S FAST FOOD AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LIKE WHERE WE ACTUALLY LAND TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL BURDENS BUT THE BUT THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN FRUITFUL AND I KNOW AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL GET TO A GOOD PLACE OKAY- WELL LIKE I WILL BE IN SUPPORT OF. THIS BILL TODAY THANK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN WELL AS MUCH AS ALL THIS STUFFING MORE OF THOSE TAKE OUT FORKS AND KNIVES INTO THAT DOOR ALONG WITH A LITTLE TOUCH OF CONTAINERS I'M LOOKING FOR THIS BILL I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I HOPE YOU MAKE IT AS EXPENSIVE AS PROCESS AS POSSIBLE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE DOING PICK UP YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPTION BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE IF THEY WOULD ASK FOR UTENSILS OR- TICKET BE TAKING HOME THIS DAY IN AGE OR- HAVE THEIR OWN UTENSILS IN THE CAR. THE REVIEWS THEM OUT BUT I DO WANT TO JUST ALSO SAY THAT YOU KNOW RESTAURANTS CERTAINLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS NOW AND EVEN GRUB HUB AND THOSE KINDS OF- DELIVERIES COULD PROGRAM THIS INTO THEIR OWN ORDERING SYSTEM THEIR AUTOMATED ORDERING SYSTEMS OF OPTING IN OUR OPTING OUT. AND SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE YOUR BILL I THINK YOU SHOULD BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN VERY LOOK VERY. A LACKADAISICAL ABOUT THIS AND- I JUST HOPE THAT ALL BUSINESSES LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE PLASTIC RIBBON AND MAKE THEIR OWN BUSINESSES MORE SUSTAINABLE- YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ACTION IF THEY WERE ACTING MORE RESPONSIBLY AND THE TRUTH IS THEY'RE NOT ACTING RESPONSIBLY AND MANY RESTAURANTS DO ASK YOU AT THIS POINT AND I COMMEND THEM FOR THAT. AND SO I YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY WITH YOU KNOW- INDUSTRY IN GENERAL WHEN THEY SORT OF DON'T TAKE ON A PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE CREATING AND SORT OF WAY FOR US TO COME IN AND THEN GET MAD THAT WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SO I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR I LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL. AND CERTAINLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU. MISTER MATHIS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- REALLY LIKE WHERE WE'RE HEADS THAT WITH THIS ONE I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM I THINK WE SEE IT EVERY DAY READ REGARDLESS OF WHERE OUR DISTRICT IS THE INCREASED AMOUNT OF TRASH THAT WERE SEEN. MY CONCERN IS WITH GOING TO BROUGHT IT IN IT WAS A CONCERN I REMEMBER WHEN- MISTER CALDERON WAS DOING THE PLASTIC STRAW BAN AND I KEPT THINKING WE- DON'T WE'RE GOING AFTER THE STRAWS WEREN'T GOING AFTER THE PACKAGE. YOU KNOW IT'S THESE THINGS ARE- PACKAGED IN PLASTIC BECAUSE A LOT OF ROOM YOU KNOW YOU GET A LITTLE CONTINENT THINGS OR- WHAT WHY ARE WE ADDRESSING THAT. IN TAKING YOU KNOW TARGETING THAT FIRST. ONTO TO JUST SIMPLY GO OKAY LET'S MAKE SURE THESE ARE GOING TO PAPER NINE AND CUT DOWN THE WASTE THAT WAY- I DO LIKE THE OCT INVERSES THE OPT OUT BUT AND TELL THE- DETAILS ARE FULLY IRONED OUT UNLESS THEY OFFER YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO THE CLOSE YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND APPRECIATE ALL OF THE MEMBERS FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL. I WOULD SAY THAT. AB TOLL SEVENTY SIX IS A WASTE REDUCTION MEASURE THAT REDUCES WEIGHT OF STRING BEFORE IT ACTUALLY- IS CREATED. AND IN FACT IT IT'LL SAVE URBAN AND RURAL COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OFCALIFORNIA MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FACT US THE RESTAURANTS IN THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY SPEND ABOUT NINETEEN BILLION. PURCHASING DISPOSABLE FOOD WHERE AND CALIFORNIA ALONE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SPEND. ALMOST UP TO FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION ANNUALLY AND ONGOING EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT LITTERING THE STREETS STORMS. STORM DRAINS DRAINS BOB PARKS AND WATERWAYS SO FOR LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE REDUCE COSTS THIS IS A SIMPLE. WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT IT'S EFFECTIVE IT'S ABOUT HOW WE CONSUME HOW WE ACT TOWARDS OUR ENVIRONMENT AND MAKE IT EASIER- I DO WANT TO SAY- I CONVENED A- A SMALL GROUP OF RESTAURANTS SMALL RESTAURANT OWNERS. IN MY DISTRICT. BECAUSE I AM VERY AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE FACED AMID COVERT NINETEEN. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP WAS THE 1% SAVINGS SO IF A RESTAURANT A SMALL RESTAURANT CAN SAVE ONE PERCENT. IN THE BOTTOM LINE WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING IN PLASTIC WHERE THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A NEW JOB. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO REINVEST IN THE RESTAURANT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO. NOT WASTE THEIR MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO GO IN TE TRASH VERSUS THE VERY REAL. ECONOMIC RECOVERY EFFORTS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS OUR STATE AND SPECIFICALLY SMALL RESTAURANTS NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW IN AN EFFORT TO. YOU KNOW BRING US BACK TO THE NORMAL THING IN A WAY THAT SAFE. AMID COVERT NINETEEN SO WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO. ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE NEED TO ACHIEVE. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I WILL. THANK U. S. MEMBER CARILLO FROM PRESENTING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE- TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY WASTE I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN SECONDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. SECRETARY WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I DON'T SEVEN AB TWELVE SEVENTY SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS RIVAS HI RIVERSIDE FLORA. LARA NOT VOTING CHAU CHAU HI FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I GARCIA GARCIA I MATHIS. MATHIS NOT VOTING MCCARTY MURATSUCHI MURATSUCHI I SAY ARE CHAU. STONE STONE I WOULD. SIX ZERO KIDNAPPED BILLS OUT BUT WILL REMAIN ON CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU. I NEXT UP WE HAVE AB EIGHT EIGHT ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WITH. THANK YOU. FOR I'LL BE QUICK THEN THIS IS A COMMON SENSE BILL IT ADDS TO THE TRANSPARENCY OF WHAT WHAT WE CALL RECYCLABLE IS REALLY BEING RECYCLED AND NOT TO SHIP TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND DISPOSED OF IN WAYS THAT WE WOULDN'T CONSIDER AS RECYCLING THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES A RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. HE THANK YOU- WE ARE READY FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HI GOOD MORNING AGAIN THIS OF THE NIQAB OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND- WANTED TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO ON AMERICAN POLICY FOR TAKING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. CONVERSATION AROUND MAKING THIS WORK- FOR TO LONG CALIFORNIA COUNTY MATERIAL BEING RECYCLED AS SOON AS THEY GO INTO SHIPPING CONTAINER HAD OVERSEE. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE BECOME ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT MUCH OF THE MATERIAL HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN MISMANAGED- IF YOU ARE IF YOU HAPPEN TO WATCH JOHN OLIVER SHOWED HAPPY CAN BE THOUGHT AND FOOTAGE OF THAT. AND I KIND OF PUT IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE REGULAR. AND A LOT WHILE SOME MATERIAL WITH DEFINITELY HIM STARTED- ONCE WE GOT OVERSEAS IT WAS DONE SO UNDER UNACCEPTABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR CONDITIONS. WHERE PEOPLE BASICALLY LOOKING FOR THE FEW LEFTOVER RECYCLABLES THAT WERE STILL IN THE MIX OF- ON RECYCLABLE GARBAGE THAT WE SENT OVER. AND THEN MOST OF THE MATERIAL END UP GETTING LANDFILLS DUMPED OR BURNED. AND POLLUTING COMMUNITIES ALL OVER SOUTHEAST ASIA- THE SLIDE TO COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ASKING FOR NEXT FIVE WAYS TO BE RECLASSIFIED AS HAZARDOUS WASTE UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL PEOPLE CONVENTION. BEGINNING JANUARY OF THIS YEAR SO RIGHT NOW IT IS ACTUALLY LEGAL FOR THE MOST ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO IMPORT. ON THE U. S. SEVEN IN RESPONSE TO THAT MANY OF THE STATE- BIGGEST WASTE HAULERS INCLUDING WASTE MANAGEMENT FOR PUBLIC RECALL G. HAVE MADE PUBLI COMMITMENTS TO STOP EXPORTING NEXT POCKET OVERSEAS. BUT IF THEY CONTINUE TO BE A LEADING EXPORTER OF THE MATERIAL AND VIOLATION OF THE PEOPLE CONNECTION. THIS BILL WILL DO A FEW SIMPLE THINGS YEAH I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT WILL RESTORE THE PUBLIC FAITH IN THE RECYCLING SYSTEM. THANK THE PUBLIC WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR RECYCLABLES CONTRIBUTING. TO THE INTERNATIONAL POLLUTION THAT THEY REGULARLY SEE ON THE EVENING NEWS- I THINK THAT'S AN EXISTENTIAL ISSUE FOR RECYCLING. AT EIGHT IT WILL ALSO KEEP MANY FACTORS TO BE ABLE TO GREEN WASH THEIR PRODUCT THOSE RECYCLABLE DESPITE NOT ACTUALLY HAVING ANY RECYCLING MARKET. BECAUSE THEY GO IN A SHIPPING CONTAINER THEY CAN ACT LIKE IT IS BEING RECYCLED. IT ALSO DRIVE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA RECYCLING MARKET.

NEXT UP WE HAVE AB TWO EIGHTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROBERT RIVAS. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES TO SEE EVERYBODY ELECTED THEY COMMITTEE STAFF FOR- ALL OF YOUR CONSIDERATION ENGAGEMENT ON THIS LEGISLATION. AND IT SEEMS THAT RECENTLY- A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN PLACED ON IT NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS ARE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. IN A LAND CONSERVATION RESTORATION AND STRATEGIC LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND INCORPORATING THESE NATURAL- SOME SOLUTIONS INTO EFFORTS TO MITIGATE INCREASING AMOUNTS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY LEVERAGING OUR FARMS RANCHES FORESTS. GRASSLANDS AND WETLANDS TO HELP REMOVE CARBON FROM OUR ATMOSPHERE AND CLEARLY THERE IS AN OBVIOUS NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH WHEN IT COMES TO FULLY UNDERSTANDING AND VALIDATING CARBON SEQUESTRATION RATES TO OUR STATE'S NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS- BUT THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR NOW ACCORDING TO A GROUNDBREAKING STUDY THAT WAS RELEASED IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. CALLED IT WAS GETTING TO NEUTRAL OPTIONS FOR NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO STORE VAST AMOUNTS OF CARBON. NOT TO MENTION OFTEN IMPORTANT- SOME CALL BENEFITS TO AIR AND WATER QUALITY. ECOSYSTEM AND SOIL HEALTH RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND PROTECTION OF LIFE AND PROPERTY TWO FIRE REDUCTION. A NATURAL WORKING LANDS IS ALSO- THAT'S CONSIDERED THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AMONG CLIMATE SOLUTIONS- BUT MOST OF US CAN AGREE THAT WE HAVE REACHED THE POINT OUR CLIMATE CRISIS WHERE WE MUST URGENTLY AND CREATIVELY. DEVELOP NEW PATHWAYS TO REDUCE AND REMOVE CARBON FROM OUR ATMOSPHERE- IT'S OF THIS LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY BILL TWO EIGHT FOUR IS INTENDED TO HELP OUR STATE IDENTIFY STRATEGIES. TO INTEGRATE OUR NATURAL WORKING LANCE'S ASSETS IN THAT FIGHT. AND SO THIS BILL WOULD SET IN STATUTE AND REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. TO IDENTIFY CLIMATE GOAL FOR THE STATE'S NATURAL WORKING LANDS WHILE IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES AND POLICY INCENTIVES. IN ACHIEVING THIS GOAL- AND SO WITH ME TODAY IS- LUCAS- FREE REX WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND JEANNIE MERYL WITH THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE. NETWORK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU. UP IF. MODERATE CAN OPEN UP THE LINES FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

TO SPEAK TODAY RIGHT NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED NATURE FOR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH OF OUR CLIMATE AND EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY FOUR WOULD HELP ADVANCE BOTH OUTCOMES AS WELL AS IN OTHER IMPORTANT BENEFITS. OVER THE PAST DECADE THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT WORK IN CALIFORNIA ON THIS TOPIC ESTIMATING GHG REDUCTION POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING METHOD NOT DEFINED A RANGE OF BENEFITS THAT WILL RESULT FROM CRIME ACTION AFTER WORKING LAND SECTOR. IN SPITE OF ALL THIS WORK THOUGH A CLEAR CLIMATE GOAL AND COORDINATED SUSTAINED ACTION LIKE WE HAVE IN OTHER SECTORS IS STILL MISSING. EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT CATALYST TO HELP ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AT PROVIDE BUT USUALLY LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE RECOGNIZING THE STATE'S NATIONAL WORKING LANDS ARE ESSENTIAL PART OF MEETING THE STATE KIND OF BOLD. ADVANTAGE AGENCY COORDINATION WITH A CLEAR LEAD THIS IS CRITICAL FOR INDUCING CONFUSION MAKING PROGRESS AT PROVIDE A CLEAR TIMELINE FOR A KIND OF PLANNING GOAL AND ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT CLIMATE STRATEGY FOR NATURAL WORKING LANDS NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OTHER IMPORTANT BENEFITS. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB. TWENTY FOUR INNER DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME'S JEANNIE MERYL I'M A POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE NETWORK WHERE COALITION OF FORMER LEADERS IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE GROUPS WORKING TO ADVANCE AGRICULTURAL SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB THREE FOUR WHICH RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO VANCE A CLINICAL AND RELATED STRATEGIES FOR ADAPTING IMPORTANT NATURAL WORKING LANDS. I WANTED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES IN AGRICULTURE WE AGREE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES THAT INCONSISTENT FUNDING FOR THE CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS LIKE THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM MAKE IT CHALLENGING TO SCALE UP AGRICULTURAL SOLUTIONS TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS. HOWEVER AS WE WORK ON BUDGET AND BOND PROPOSALS TO SUPPORT STABLE AND IMPROVE FUNDING FOR CLIMATE SMART ACT PROGRAMS WE CAN'T THE LANE CREATING A STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK FOR ADVANCING NATURAL WORKING LANDS CLIMATE SOLUTIONS AS PROPOSED BY EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY FOUR. OF MY COLLEAGUES IN AGRICULTURE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE IMPACT IS GREATER WEATHER EXTREMES INCLUDING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES I MEAN WE MUST PAUSE EFFORTS LIKE EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY FOUR WE DO NOT ACT NOW HOWEVER TO EMBRACE MORE RESILIENCE AND CLIMATE FRIENDLY AND NATURAL WORKING LANDS ONE WILL BE TO IT- WE CAN'T WAIT TO OTHER STATES LITERALLY BURNS OUR AGRICULTURAL LANDS CAN AND SHOULD BE PART OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE SOLUTIONS. AND WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN AGRICULTURE THAT WE MUST FIND CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND RESILIENCE OF OUR AGRICULTURAL LANDS IN AB. TWO EIGHTY FOUR AND BRACES THESE MULTIPLE BENEFITS. WE SAW DURING THE- LAST YEAR WE HAD MORE FARMERS THAN EVER. IT UP CLIMATE PRO FOR FIELD ONE OR FROM. AND A HEALTHY SO PRO. EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY FOUR WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO UNDERSTAND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO SCALE UP THIS WORK IN MEANINGFUL WAYS.

THANKS WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY. THANK YOU- ANY QUESTIONS WHAT NEXT WE HAVE QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS I'M GONNA START WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORIDA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- THEY ALSO MAKE ME APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOUNG SAID RELATED ISSUES AND THAT'S AWESOME THAT YOU CARE AS MUCH ABOUT THIS IS YOU DO. BUT AS WE CONTINUE TO- THAT PUSHES MANDATE ON ACT WHICH I KNOW THAT YOU'RE VERY WELL AWARE OF THAT THAT'S KIND OF. A THING THAT WE DO. IS THERE ANY. MOVEMENT OR ANY ABILITY TO GIVE PERMANENT CROPS WELL THIS WEEK AMMONS WALNUTS CHERRIES PISTACHIOS WHATEVER THOSE FOLKS ARE GROWING. THE CREDIT THE PARTY CONSTRUCTION CUTS ONLY PLAN ROUGHLY HUNDRED THIRTY TREES THE WEAKER. AND I THINK AS WE TALK ABOUT CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND THE NEED FOR THAT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL FOR THAT COMMUNITY TO A- HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO LEAST GET CREDIT FOR THE TREES OF THE PUTTING ON THE GROUND. ANY ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT SURE YEAH I KNOW- APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS ON THE MEMBER FLORA AND- YOU KNOW I THINK FIRST- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM OPPOSITION YOU KNOW AS ONE OF THE COMMENTS WAS MADE IS EXERCISING CAUTION- WE LOOK AT THIS BILL. IT'S A VERY CAUTIOUS APPROACH IN ESTABLISHING A GOAL IT'S DOESN'T MANDATE ANYTHING THE ONLY THING THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY MANDATES IS THE REQUIRES CARP TO. WORK WITH STATE AID RATHER STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO ESTABLISH THIS GOAL AND SO I THINK YOUR POINT IS A IS WELL TAKEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST SECTION OF THIS BILL- IT CALLS ON A R. B. TO DEVELOP STANDARD METHODS FOR STATE AGENCIES TO TRACK. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND SO CERTAINLY- I THINK- WE TALK ABOUT- EXISTING- LAND MANAGEMENT- NOW IN THE STATE YEAH IT'S AS IT RELATES TO SPECIFIC- CROPS YOU KNOW THAT NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED IN PART OF THIS EFFORT AS WELL BECAUSE WHAT. WORKS WELL IN ONE AREA THE STATE IS GOING TO WORK WELL IN ANOTHER AREA AND THAT'S WHY IT'S ABOUT BRINGING TOGETHER THESE EXPERTS- TO ESTABLISH A GOAL- TO ASSESS OUR ENTIRE LANDSCAPING CALIFORNIA- WHICH IS AS WE ALL KNOW VERY- IS DIVERSE- AND- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. UP IT'S VERY DIFFERENT CROSS DAY. WE YOU HAVE THOSE COME. WITH CARBON DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE IS A- THE DESIRE TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE CHANGES BECAUSE THERE'S GONNA BE SOME BIG CHANGES WITHIN THE STATUTE OF THE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE TO MAKE THAT. DOABLE DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE IS A DESIRE FOR THAT YEAH WELL I- YOU KNOW I CAN'T I CAN'T COMMENT ON BEHALF OF KERR BUT I THINK THAT CERTAINLY THERE'S WE READ THE- THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY AT THE ACT THAT. YOU KNOW. WITH IN CAR OVER THE YEARS AROUND DOING SOMETHING AROUND THAT'S WORKING LANDS ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT THIS PIECEMEAL- APPROACHES PROGRAM BY PROGRAM APPROACH WHEN IT COMES OUR NETWORKING LANDS BUT I THINK. THAT'S OUR GOAL HERE IS TO PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE POTENTIAL MATCH WORKING LANDS. TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE BEST PRACTICES- AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE AS AS WE KNOW AS RESEARCH INDICATES. AS THE SCIENCE INDICATES IS IT IS CERTAINLY. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY- FOR OUR STATE TO UTILIZE OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS- TO BE PART OF- THE LARGER CLIMATE CRISIS WERE ENCOUNTERING. AND OBVIOUSLY AS I MENTIONED- WITH THE- NEW ADMINISTRATION WASHINGTON THERE'S A PLACE IN A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON THIS IN CASE AS WE KNOW WE HAD. A THROUGH OUR- COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE ENVIRONMENTAL AGRICULTURE HEARING- WHERE KAREN ROSS. SECRETARY OF CDFA. HIGHLIGHTED THE UNIQUE PROGRAMS WE OFFER AN ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING. WHICH ARE UNIQUE TO THE COUNTRY NOT VERY MANY STATES ARE WHERE WE ARE- AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE PROGRAMS LIKE HEALTHY SOILS AND AMP PROGRAM. MET THE REDUCTIONS THEY'RE OVERPRESCRIBED- THEY ARE. IN THE BACK TO OUR I'VE BEEN ON VERY POPULAR PROGRAMS. YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT UTILIZE THEM- TALK ABOUT- THE BENEFITS THEY SEE AND THEY HOW THEY APPRECIATED PROGRAMS. BUT CERTAINLY THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE MADE AS A STATE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. NOT CREATE THAT AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO TO WORK WITH YOU- WITH KERR ON THIS ISSUE I WOULD LOVE TO BE A PART OF THAT. BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT- THE COMMUNITY- WE'VE HAD THIS KIND. IS A AND WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD IN A LOT OF THESE AREAS. IF THERE IS THAT CARE VERSUS STICK APPROACH. AND I THINK IF WE CAN GIVE THEM. SOME SORT OF. ADDITIONAL OPTIONS TO GET THE SEQUESTRATION CREDITS- THIS BILL BECOMES INCREDIBLY SUPPORTABLE. BUT I WOULD I WOULD JUST HOLD OFF ON IT RIGHT NOW BUT WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE IS A- SOME OPPORTUNITIES HERE TO GIVE ACT- ADDITIONAL OPTIONS ON SEQUESTRATION. SURE THE ANSWER YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MAN I'M SURE I'M GONNA START OFF BY THANKING THE- HI MY CO PARTNER ON AS AG HERE IS ON THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF AGRICULTURE AND BEEN WORKING ON THESE ISSUES FOR YEARS GOING ON GOT REALLY SIX SEVEN YEARS NOW- THE AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO ALIGN WITH THE- THE CALLING MISTER FLORES COMMENTS YOU KNOW.

WITH THE CAVIAR OF I WANT TO SEE SOME ACTUAL. OCT CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS IN HERE GOING TO THIS TO PROVIDE THAT KERRY- SOME OF US WHO SPENT. FIVE AND WEEKENDS WORKING WITH- FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. IN IRONING OUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM- I REMEMBER SOME VERY LATE NIGHT CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM. TO ENSURE THE FUNDING FOR THE SPECIFIC ISSUES FOR AGRICULTURE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE BACKING UP THE SIZE THAT WE ARE USING THIS. AS A KERRY VERSUS THE STATE TO MOVE OUR STATE FORWARD- WE NEED TO SEE IT ACTUALLY HAPPEN- YOU KNOW I RECENTLY GOT INTERVIEWED BY- NBC NEW YORK IN REGARDS TO HIGH SPEED RAIL IN TALKING ABOUT BUDGET PRIORITIES IN OUR STATE IN THE STILL BLOWS MY MIND THAT WE'RE SPENDING SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS A- DAY. TO GO AFTER A HIGH SPEED RAIL. NGUYEN IF WE WERE FORTY SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS A DAY INTO OUR AGRICULTURAL CROPS WITH ACTUALLY BEGINNING A BIGGER BANG FOR OUR BALK WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. SO I ASKED MY OTHER COLLEAGUE SOON IN MEMBERS OUT THERE. YOU KNOW THINK THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS THINK ABOUT WERE ACTUALLY SPENDING OUR MONEY. TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT. ALL FROM THE CITY CALIFORNIA IS THE NUMBER ONE AXFORD DO YOU SEEN STATE. NET NOT ONLY IN THE COUNTRY BUT IN THE WORLD. WE WILL PRODUCE MORE AND MORE FINANCIALLY FOR FIVE TIMES MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. IN OUR AD PROCESSES OR ONE OF THE TOP. CLIMIE REDUCTIONS THAT WE CAN DO FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION MR FLOORS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR TREE CROPS ARE GETTING THOSE CARBON CREDITS. IN INDUSTRIES I WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON THAT WE WE'VE HAD THE TALKS WITH BEEN ON THE TOUR'S. WE WE'VE TALKED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS BY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THESE CLIMATE GOALS AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE ACTUALLY- PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD ON THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THAT WE IT'S NOT JUST TALK IT'S ACTUALLY ACTION.

AB TWELVE A ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANG AND I'M GONNA ASK PRESENTERS TO PLEASE SET UP THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TABLE SO WE MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING FOR MARK COMMITTEE SECRETARY. MOVED A BILL. GREAT THANK YOU FOR FIRST LET ME JUST SAY I'M ACCEPTING ALL THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE LIMITS IN THE BILL ANALYSIS. AND ALSO PLAN TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. BPI ON THEIR SUGGESTION TO DELAY THE BILL'S TIMELINE FOR COMPLYING WITH THE NATIONAL ORGANICS PROGRAM. AGAIN AB TWELVE A ONE PART PRODUCT ME HIGHER QUALITY STANDARDS IN ORDER TO THE LABEL AS COMPOSTABLE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FEDERAL. THANK YOU. I'M SO WE'RE READY FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MODERATOR IF YOU CAN OPEN THE LINES. THE LINES ARE OPEN. SHE SAID SHE. OKAY WE'RE READY I BELIEVE WE HAVE CHRISTINE WILL PHARMACOLOGY. YEAH I THINK SO MUCH OF THIS IS CHRISTINE WOKE WITH RECOLOGY. WE'VE BEEN OPERATING MUNICIPAL COMPOSTING PROGRAMS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE EIGHTY TWELVE A ONE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WE CAN GET CARE PREPARING IMPLEMENT CONVERSE TACKLE THAT FEATURES NINETY THREE REGULATIONS NEXT YEAR. SB THIRTY THREE WILL REQUIRE JURISDICTIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO IMPLEMENT TO TRACK WITH COVERING OUR GAME X. PROCESSING PROGRAMS. WE'RE SEEING THAT MANY JURISDICTIONS WANT TO INCLUDE COMPOSTABLE PACKAGING OF PRODUCTS IN OUR PROGRAMS IN THE INTEREST OF MAXIMIZING CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE. MANY DID COMMUNITIES ALONG WITH INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS WANT USE COMPOSTABLE TO MINIMIZE THEIR DEPENDENCE SOMETHING. GO USE DISPOSABLE PLASTIC. HOWEVER JUST LIKE PRODUCTS CLAIM TO PRECISE. PRODUCTS THAT ARE LABELED COMPOSED SHOULD ACTUALLY BE CAPABLE BEING COMPOSTED. BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STANDARDS TO VISUALLY DIFFERENTIATE NON COMBUSTIBLE COMPOSTABLE PRODUCTS NEITHER CONSUMERS NOR COMPOSTERS CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM. BECAUSE WE CAN'T RISK CONTAMINATING ARE COMPOSTED PLASTIC MOST OF THIS MATERIAL MUST BE EXCLUDED AT THE BEGINNING OF A COMPLEX PROCESS SENT TO LANDFILL. COMPOSED PRODUCTS AND- ENTERED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE COMPLEX WE MAKE IN OUR ABILITY TO MARKET TO AGRICULTURAL CUSTOMERS OUR LARGEST MARKET. ACOSTA EXTENSIVE DECONTAMINATION EQUIPMENT AT THE FACILITY TO OPERATE PLUS THE COST OF DISPOSAL INCREASE THE COSTS OF THESE PROGRAMS AT THE TIME WE CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. ACCORDING TO CAL CYCLE CALIFORNIA WILL NEED TO BUILD BETWEEN EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED NEW COMPOST FACILITIES. TO PROCESS ORGANIC DIVERTED FROM LANDFILL TO MEET OUR SHORT WITH QUITE A POINT REDUCTION GOAL. EACH DAY SO WHAT IT WILL NEED TO BE DESIGNED AND PERMITTED TO SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY COMPOSTED WASTE WHILE MEETING STRINGENT ERIN WATER QUALITY STANDARDS. WE'LL TRY TO CONFRONT THIS CHALLENGE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE WASTING TIME AND MONEY CLEANING UP THE PROBLEM THAT CAN BE FIXED AT THE SOURCE. AB TWELVE A ONE ONE HALF THESE ISSUES BY SETTING STANDARDS FOR COMPOSTABLE PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMPOST MYSTERY IN JURISDICTIONS. USING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU. THANK NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING JERRY ABOUT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I PROJECT OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF FOR THE IMPORTANT TIME THE GIRL I'M DELIGHTED YOU'RE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPOST COLLISION OUR MEMBERS ARE PREDOMINATELYSERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE NATIONALITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA PROCESS YARD TRIMMINGS. AND INCREASINGLY FOOD WASTE. OUR MEMBERS NAMES INCREASE REFLECT ORGANIC. AND FOR THE USE OF CLEAN COMPOST OF THE WAY TO COMPLETE THE ORGANIC RECYCLING WAS. AB TWO ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE NECESSARY STEPANEK INCOMPATIBLE PRODUCTS APART OF THE CAPITAL ORGANICS RECYCLING SYSTEM YOU KEEP THEM OUT OF LANDFILLS. THE VAST MAJORITY WELL OVER 95% OF PROPOSAL PACKAGING IS CURRENTLY BEING LANDFILLED. IT'S DOUBLING LABELING AND IDENTIFICATION STANDARDS INCLUDING SPECIFIC COLORING IDENTIFICATION MARKING FOR COMPATIBLE PACKAGING WILL HELP PREVENT CONSUMER CONFUSION WHAT SORTS OF READING FOOD WASTE AND ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF PROCESSING FACILITY OPERATORS TO REMOVE NON COMPOSTABLE PACKAGING. HELPING REDUCE CONTAMINATION IN FOOD CAPITAL ACTION PROGRAMS. REDUCING PROGRAM COSTS. MOST COMPOSTERS BELIEVE THE COMPOSABLE FOODSERVICE CAN HAVE VALUE IN HELPING COLLECTION PROGRAMS DELIVER MARKETS CRAFTED THEIR FACILITIES BLOATING LOOK MORE EFFECTIVELY. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT ATTRIBUTES OF COMPOSABLE FOOD PACKAGING MEAN THAT THEY ARE PART OF A SYSTEM WHICH IS DESIGNED TO FAIL. SIMILAR TO THE WASTE RECYCLING PHENOMENON WHICH COMPOSTING DOES NOT MEAN THAT COMPOSTERS ARE ABLE TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO THEIR FACILITIES LIKE IMPOSSIBLE PACKAGING. WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED PROCESSING COSTS REMOVED AND ULTIMATELY DISPOSE OF THEM. ADDITIONALLY COMPOSABLE PLASTICS ARE NOT ALLOWED FOR USE IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE MEETING COMPOST WHICH IS PRODUCED INCLUDING THEM IS NOT ALLOWED AS AN ORGANIC INPUT. WHICH IS REGULATED UNDER CDFA AUTHORITY. AND WHAT'S REQUIRED THEY WROTE THAT REMOVAL PROCESS BE EMPLOYED DURING COMPOST PRODUCTION. NEW FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT REQUIREMENTS ALONG WITH MARKETING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER DIRECTIVES FROM CONVENTIONAL PRODUCE PURCHASERS LIKE WALMART MCDONALD'S AND OTHERS ARE PUSHING MOST CONVENTIONAL GROWERS USE ONLY CDFA CERTIFIED ORGANIC INPUT. ANY COMPATIBLE PLASTIC NOT BE ELIMINATED FROM THE FEEDSTOCKS. AGRICULTURE IS THE SINGLE LARGEST MARKET FOR COMPOST WITH OVER 60% SHARE NOW THAT REMAINS LARGELY UNTAPPED. AT ORGANIC DIVERSION PROGRAM GROWTH MEDICALLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS TO MEET THE LOFTY GOALS THAT THE THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETS FOR COMP INCREASE IMMENSELY. LATTERLY COMPOSABLE PRODUKTIVNOSTI MEET THE PRODUCTION CYCLE OF THE TYPICAL COMPOST MANUFACTURER. WELL ASTM STANDARDS FOR COMPOSTABLE PLASTICS ALLOW FOR UP TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS TO ACHIEVE 95% BIO DEGRADATION OF THE MATERIAL. MOKABA PRODUCERS WORK ON FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY DAY CYCLE OR SOMETIMES SHORTER. WE'LL BE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS THIS CURRENT BILL LANGUAGE TO ADD A FIELD TESTING PROTOCOL AND ENSURE THE COMPLETE TOTAL PRODUCT ME COPPER MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS. AB TWO ALTHOUGH ONE COMES AT A CRITICAL TIME IN HELPING TO ENSURE THAT THE COMPOSED LOOKING PACKAGING MEETS IT VALUE PROMISE AS AN ASSET TO FOODS CRAP RECYCLING PROGRAMS. HELPING COMPOSTERS CLOSE THE LOOP ON ORGANIC MATERIAL AND HELP THE STATE MEET ITS CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS INSTEAD OF BURDENING ARE ALREADY SCARED INFRASTRUCTURE WITH CONTAMINATION CHALLENGES. WE THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE ALIGNED AND ASPIRIN I LOVE. THANK YOU- NEXT I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM. KATE SNOW ONE ANYONE AT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY LOCATION.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. JUST A QUESTION AND IF IT WAS BROUGHT UP AND I MISSED IT I APOLOGIZE- GO TO SOME LITTLE OFF THE WALL SO- IT'S BUT MAYBE AS LOW BLOOD SUGAR- HAS HAS THE INDUSTRY THAT PRODUCES- COMPOSTABLE PLASTICS CONSIDERED. A SPECIFIC COLOR. FOR THESE AS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT- THAT THOSE SPECIFIC COLORED ITEMS END UP IN THE RIGHT WAY STRENGTH THE- REASON I. YES THAT'S NOT A COMPARISON OF THE TWO BUT I THINK OF. ADDITIONAL PIPE FOR WATER AND RECYCLE WATER BEING A PURPLE PIPE. SO I JUST WONDER IS THE INDUSTRY CONSIDER THAT AS A WAY TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT THE WAY STREAMS DO NOT GET- DO NOT GET CONTAMINATED. YEAH LET ME SEE IF NEIL- CHRISTINE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I DON'T. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO- YEAH THE INDUSTRY IS PROPOSED THAT. DIRECTLY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF. COLOR SCHEMES TO BROWN OR GREEN. IN NATURE. AND I THINK WILL ALSO BE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS STILL. FADEOUT OR ELIMINATE OTHER LOOKALIKE PRODUCTS I KNOW MANY OF YOU PROBABLY GOT YOUR LOCAL SAFEWAY AND GOTTEN A GREEN PLASTIC BAG THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A COMPOSABLE BAG- SO THOSE KINDS OF CONFUSING PRODUCT ON THE MARKET ONLY EXACERBATE CONTAMINATION ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS.

TO HELP MITIGATE THE DESTRUCTION AND THE LOSS OF LIFE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE WE MUST COMMIT TO MEANINGFUL REFORM THAT WILL RETURN OUR LANDS AND FORESTS TO HEALTHY CONDITIONS THAT REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES ONE IMPORTANT WAY WE CAN FURTHER THIS COMMITMENT IS BY SUPPORTING PROVEN METHODS THAT WORK TO TREAT OUR FORESTS AND REDUCE WILDFIRE RISKS. THIS BILL IS ONE SUCH MEASURE THAT WILL EXTEND BY THREE YEARS A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR WILDFIRE REDUCTION PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LANDS THAT HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE STANDARDS AND THE REVIEW UNDER THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT NEPA. PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL HELP REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO SIGNIFICANT WILDFIRE PREVENTION IT WILL SAVE LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES OF VALUABLE TIME AND RESOURCES. WHILE STILL MAINTAINING MEANINGFUL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW STANDARDS. UNDER NEPA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I DO HAVE TO- WITNESSES HERE FOR TESTIMONY. L.

THE REGION HAS THE FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE CORRECT NEED A POLICY TO MEET STATE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING ANALYSIS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. NO CRIED TO COMPLETE COMPLETE A SEQUEL ANALYSIS IN ADDITION TO A NEEDS ANALYSIS IS OFTEN RESULT OF STATE PLANS BEING USED ON FEDERAL LANDS. OKAY TO THE PROJECTS ARE FUNDED. AND ADMINISTERED TO CALIFORNICA NEXT YEAR AND THAT'LL NEVADA CONSERVANCY AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES. A COLLABORATION THIS COLLABORATION REFLECTS THE NATURE SHARED STEWARDSHIP IN CALIFORNIA WERE BREAKING DOWN BOUNDARIES LOOKING FOR RESTORATION FROM A HOST POLITICAL LANDSCAPE APPROACH THAT INCLUDES ALL LANDS USING BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING.

THE SIMPSONS PHABLET IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SENATE BILL NINE A ONE WHICH IS COMPOSED FOR EXTENSION IN AB TWO SIXTY SEVEN WAS INTENDED TO HELP INCREASE THE PAPERS CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT IF YOU'LL TREATMENT PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LANDS. THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE TO THE NEED FOR PRIMARY MENTAL REVIEW PROCESS. NEED VISION HAS ALREADY MADE POSSIBLE SUCH MODERN PROJECTS AS THE FRENCH MEADOWS PARTNERSHIP IN OUR MEMBER COUNTY PLASTER WHICH IS AN INNOVATIVE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE RESTORATION PROJECT UNDERWAY BY PLASTER COUNTY. AFTER COUNTY WATER AGENCY U. S. FOREST SERVICE THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND IF YOU'RE NEVADA CONSERVANCY. WITHOUT THE SB NINE ONE EXEMPTION FRENCH MEADOWS WOULD LIKELY HAVE BEEN DELAYED SEVERAL MONTHS FOR NICK WHAT THE FIRST PEOPLE TO THINK FOR RADIO. MUCH OF WHICH WOULD BE DUPLICATIVE OF WHAT WAS ALREADY DONE UNDERNEATH THAT. THE STATE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THIS ON FEDERAL LANDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO HELP RESTORE FEDERAL FOREST LANDS AND PREVENT FUTURE WILDFIRES WHICH IS WHY RC RC STRONGLY SUPPORT EXTENDING THE SUNSET ON THE SEQUENCE ACTION AS PROPOSED IN AB TWO SIXTY SEVEN.

THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND EQUIPPED PENSION FOR FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LANDS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE THE PROJECT COVERED IN DEL INVOLVING TENS OF PROPERTIES SUCH AS REMOVING TRADES WITH HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND APPLYING HERBICIDES. APPERLEY PLANNED THE PROJECT CAN HAVE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL. FOR NEGATIVE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS SUCH. AS OPPOSED TO SEE WHAT YOU WANTED ME BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE MEDICATION ANY BEDS CUMULATIVE AFFECT THEM OUT THAT IS WEAKER THIS BILL WOULD CONTINUE SUBJECTING LARGE SWATHS OF CALIFORNIA'S POOREST TO INTENSIVE OPERATIONS. WITHOUT MEDICATION AND WEAKER ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. THIS SHOULD AND SUPPORT GARAGE BENEFITS ECOLOGICALLY BENEFICIAL ACTIONS SUCH AS PRESCRIBED DID MANAGE FIRE HI THE MEANS TO RETURN FIRE TO CALIFORNIA'S. DR SOURCED HOWEVER DURING OPERATIONS AND EVEN PRESCRIBED FIRE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES CAN HAVE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES IF NOT DONE PROPERLY. LAND MANAGERS SHOULD TAKE EVEN MORE CARE TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT. AN OPERATION AND MITIGATE THEM WHEN DEALING WITH COMPLEX FORCED AND CHAPARRAL ECOSYSTEMS. THIS EXEMPTION ALLOWED SIR LAST CAREFUL FOREST OPERATIONS AND COULD THEREFORE TO GRADE CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE AND FRAGILE LANDSCAPES AND EVEN HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AGAIN SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA.

AT THE END OF THE PROCESS DANIEL MENTIONED- NEPA DOES NOT REQUIRE MEDICATION AND- PROVIDE THE SAME CONTEXT THAT SEQUENCE WHERE WE END UP HAVING MEASURES BUILT RIGHT INTO THE PROJECTS TO HELP TO MITIGATE AGAINST SOME OF THE IMPACTS THAT HAPPEN WITHIN THOSE PROJECTS SECONDLY THE CUMULATIVE AND THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS HAPPEN TO COMPLETE THAT HAPPENS AT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SCALE IN AS MUCH MORE THOROUGH OFTEN WITH. THE SEQUEL ANALYSIS SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE THESE MULTI STAKEHOLDER MULTI LANDOWNER PROJECTS WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MUCH MORE ACCOUNT TO THOSE AND REDUCE THOSE IMPACTS UNDER THE SYKORA REVIEW IN THE PROJECT CHANGES THAT COME FROM THAT SEEK REVIEW AND LASTLY ON THIS NEPA REVIEW HAPPENS AT A MUCH LARGER SCALE IT IS TRUE THAT LOOKS AT ALL OF THE MANY OF THE SAME IMPACTS BUT IT'S LOOKING AT THEM AT THE PROGRAMMATIC SCALE AND THE SEQUEL REVIEW ALLOWS US TO POUR DOWN INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PROJECT. NOT TEARING OFF OF A PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FOR THESE REASONS THERE'S TONS OF BENEFITS GIVEN TO US FROM THE SECRET YOU WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY THESE PROJECTS. SHOULD BOTH BE PROTECTING OUR CAN UNITY'S. IN PROTECTING THEM BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AGAIN WE'RE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU ALL START WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED ON SB NINE OH ONE- I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE EXTENSION- I A- I DO. WANT TO POINT OUT I THINK THAT. A LOT OF THESE- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJECTS TAKE A LONG TIME WITH OR WITHOUT- A SEQUENCE. ANALYSIS AND I THINK THAT- IT IS IT IS. IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE THIS WORK I WANT TO I WILL POINT OUT THIS IS YOU'RE ASKING FOR A THREE YEAR EXISTS- EXTENSION THAT'S NOT SO IT'S NOT A FOREVER THING. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IF YOU HAVE ME ON. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CITY. THANK YOU VENTURA NAY MAY OF THE SENATE PORTIONS WHO'S ONE OF THE OPPOSITION FOR SURE GO AHEAD. OKAY SO DO YOU TO OR TO SEVERAL MY LAST PERSONS HI I'M HERE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES THE HE GREW UP AS IT RELATES TO MITIGATION AND HEWLETT AND PACKARD BUT IT SEEMS LIKE- YOU KNOW. WE JUST CONSIDERING ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE ALL YOU SEE MINIMAL ONE ARE IS THAT THAT THAT STREAMLINING INVESTIGATING- ORDER BY HALFORD'S- TAKE A- PRIORITY- pUP ADDRESS A MICROPHONE IN THAT AT THIS POINT IS MORE BECAUSE- ONE OF OUR MANY THAT YOU WORRY ABOUT. WE NEED PEOPLE. YEAH MADAM CHAIR I FOLLOWED I ALL RIGHT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'VE MAY NOW FOR AS- SO. YOU COULD BE BRIEF THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY. RECENT IF YOU COULD BRIEF JUST OKAY OF TIME BUT SHE HAS REQUESTED- THIS- MIKE IS TO WHAT OF THE TWO OPPOSING- WITNESSES- MY- MY CAN MIKE MY PERCEPTION IS THAT WHILE I RECOGNIZE THE COMPROMISES BETWEEN THE NEPA AND SYKORA. THAT THE HIGHER PRIORITY IS TO STREAMLINE AND- PRIORITIZE THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION IS THE WHAT FAR MITIGATION. YOU KNOW IT SHOULD THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION BE A HIGHER PRIORITY IN TERMS OF THE- OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE WILDFIRES- RELATIVE TO BID NEPA SYKORA- COMPROMISES. HELLO THE QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE WE STILL HAVE THEM ON THE LINE. YES I'M HERE I WAS. HAVING TROUBLE GETTING OUT YEAH- SO I THINK. BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S FIRST OF ALL. WE DON'T IF YOU WERE NOT ANALYZING THE- THE PRACTICE PROJECTS TO THAT THE FULL EXTENT THAT WE NEED TO BE TAKEN ACTUALLY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD INCREASE- WILDFIRE RISK FOR COULD INCREASE- THE DAMAGE TO THE ECOSYSTEM SHOULD DAY- ENCOUNTER WILD FIRES THAT THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY. THE- SECOND OF ALL THERE'S A RELATIVELY. NOW WE DO HAVE- INCREASED WILDFIRES IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S STILL. A RELATIVELY LOW CHANCE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL. RAJAT THAT OCCURS IN THE FOREST WILL ENCOUNTER WILD FIRES IN A TIME INTERVAL- NECESSARY- BEFORE I WOULD HAVE TO BE- THAT THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE TO BE PRE DINER- MAINTAINED- AND SO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IF WE DIDN'T DO THEIR CORPORATE WILD FIRE FOR I MEAN THE APPROPRIATE RUBIO UP FRONT. AND THEN WE COULD HAVE HAD AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS- AND THEN ACTUALLY NOT NOT ADDRESS THE WILDFIRE PLUCKY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- LIKE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- POINT AT WHAT CAME OUT- AUGUST THIRTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY- OUR STATE ACTUALLY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT FOR SHARED STEWARDSHIP- CALIFORNIA'S FORESTS AND RANGELANDS- WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO PURSUE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF OUR CALIFORNIA FOREST IN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF FEDERAL FORCED. TO GET CLEANED UP TO MITIGATE OUR FIRE RISK- WHAT WE'VE SEEN HOWEVER IS THE PROBLEM WITH CHIC WAS SLOWING DOWN THESE PROJECTS AND WE'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP UP AND THEN ON THE BUDGETARY SIDE BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING TO PULL THE FUNDING FROM CLEANING UP. AND PUT IT TO THAT PUTTING OUT THE FIRE IN THE HAVOC OF THESE MASSIVE FOREST FIRES WHICH WERE NOT ACTUALLY SEEN THE FUNDING GOING TO CLEANING UP I JOIN AUTHORED THIS BILL- WITH ASSEMBLYWOMAN VALLADARES BECAUSE WE SEE THIS THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE ONLY WAY TO ACTUALLY GET OUT THERE. IS TO EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS IS DOCTOR WHICH STATED THIS IS THE ONLY A THREE YEAR EXTENSION- TO MOVE FORWARD. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING THE THINGS NECESSARY- I UNDERSTAND THE- OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS BUT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OR LET IT ALL BURN TO THE GROUND.

HEY ONE OF THEM WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT AMONG CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE FURTHER IN Q. IT THIS TIME CREATE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. MR SAY OCTOBER TENTH I NOTICE IN THIS THERE'S A LOT OF- LIKE WE JUST FOR ONE INSTANCE THIS TRAINING FACILITY FOR PRESCRIBED BURNS. WHAT DOES THAT ENTAIL AND HOW MUCH COST IS RELATED TO THAT AND- HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THAT'S EFFECTIVE BECAUSE- IN THE FIRE SERVICE WE ARE EXTENSIVELY TRAINED FOR THAT PURPOSE AND WE DON'T REALLY NEED A TRAINING FACILITY FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I DON'T HAVE. AN ESTIMATE FOR YOU AT THIS MOMENT ABOUT COST BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE ON THIS BILL AND THE IDEA WITH THIS IS TO HELP. TRAIN THE INDIGENOUS- THE PEOPLE WILL BE WORKING ON THE INDIGENOUS BURNS UP TO HAVE TO HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE DOING THIS OF THAT AS THEY WORK ALONGSIDE ALONGSIDE THEIR PARTNERS A CALL FIRE. WILL BE MORE EXPERIENCED- PEOPLE OUT THERE TO HELP FACILITATE ALL OF THIS AS WELL AS TO- WORK ON- A PRESCRIBED FIRE BURN BOSS CURRICULUM THAT CAN ALSO BE RUN THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS SO THAT. THE PEOPLE WHO. WE CAN EXPAND THE NUMBER OF EXPERIENCED AND QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHO RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING THIS WORK BUT ONE OF THE BARRIERS AND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED RIGHT. SO WE DO HAVE QUALIFIED BOSS AND BURN FOR BURN BOSSES AND WE HAVE PROGRAMS FOR THAT EXTENSIVELY IN THE STATE THE C. STC. SO. I GUESS I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE- AMOUNT OF COSTS FOR. SOMETHING THAT WE KIND OF DON'T HAVE A GRASP ON ON WHAT IT IS EXACTLY THAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING- AS FAR AS ITS EFFECTIVENESS. AND WILDFIRES. JUST TO CLARIFY- ONE WE WERE TRYING TO EXPLORE WHY. THERE WERE NOT MORE BURNS IN AREAS THAT WOULD THAT COULD USE THE BURNS THIS HAD CONSTANTLY COME UP AS A ONE OF THE REASONS AND ONE OF THE BARRIERS WAS NOT HAVING ENOUGH EXPERIENCE PERSONNEL- BOTH WITH THE BERM BOSSES AND OTHERWISE. SO THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO. CREATE JOBS FOR ONE THING AS WELL AS TRAINING PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND WE WILL WORK CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE. AND THE REST OF THE FIRE COMMUNITY- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS RIGHT THERE'S ONLY A FEW AGENCIES ARE ACTUALLY QUALIFIED HAVE QUALIFYING GRANDPA'S FOLKS. AND IN THOSE AGENCIES THEMSELVES ARE ARE. NOT- I MEAN. IF YOU'RE ABOUT DOING EXCESSIVE BURNING IS A Q. AND D. PERMITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORIDA. YEAH IT IS VERY SHORT WILL JUST GO.

I WAS HERE THAT HE MAY WHEN WE TALK YOU TO JUST PEOPLE ABOUT DOING YOUR OWN THE FIRE ON THE GROUND IN CONTROL OVER WITHIN THEIR BEFORE SYSTEM THING HAPPENED TOLD I THINK. WE NEED TO ON OBVIOUSLY- ARTISTS WITH THE BUT I. BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL AND- I AM EXCITED ABOUT THE LEAST THE CONVERSATIONS.
