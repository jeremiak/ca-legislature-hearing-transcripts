TO WALK WELCOME YOU ALL TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE ELEVEN BILLS ON OUR AGENDA TODAY SO QUITE A LOT TO COVER. OUT ONE OF THOSE BILLS -- ITEM EIGHT SB FIVE NINETY TWO IS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR -- SO WITH THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A QUORUM WILL BEGIN AS A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE AND INVITE UP OUR FIRST AUTHOR. A SENATOR WIENER FOR SB ONE FIFTY NINE I JUST TWO OF REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR GENERAL RULES ON WITNESSES IN FAVOR WITNESSES AGAINST FOR PROVIDING SIX MINUTES ON EACH SIDE SO. THOSE WHO ARE IN EACH SIDE SHOULD WORK IT OUT SO THEY CAN STAY WITHIN THE LIMITS AND THEN. WE'LL ASK ASK PEOPLE TO COME TO THE MIKE WITH ME TO THIS JUST TO GIVE THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION -- SO WE CAN TRY. TO GET THROUGH ALL OF OUR BUSINESS TODAY SO VERY GOOD SENATOR WIENER WELCOME YOU'RE WELCOME TO TO BEGIN. I THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN -- FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY ON SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY NINE AT A BILL THAT WILL. HELP US IN OUR EFFORT TO REDUCE AND ULTIMATELY AND HIV INFECTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WANNA START BY -- ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I WANNA ACROSS MY PERSONAL THANKS TO YOU -- AS CHAIR AND ALSO TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF UP WORKING HARD AND DILIGENTLY WITH US OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS -- ON THESE AMENDMENTS AND WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE BILL SO SERIOUSLY AND HELPING US -- MOVING ON A POSITIVE HOUSE OF THANK YOU -- COLLEAGUES ARE SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY NINE WILL EXPAND ACCESS -- TO TO CRITICAL -- AND POWERFUL AND LIFESAVING -- HIV PREVENTIVE MEDICINE MEDICATIONS. SPECIFICALLY BY PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS OR PROP. AND POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS OR PAP. BY ALLOWING PHARMACISTS TO FURNISH THEM UP FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT A PHYSICIAN'S PRESCRIPTION. SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY NINE ALSO A PROHIBITS INSURANCE COMPANIES. FROM SUBJECTING PROP AND TAPPED -- TO USELESS AND IRRATIONAL PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS OR STEP THERAPY -- PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS THAT DO NOTHING EXCEPT TO PUT UP BARRIERS AND DENY ACCESS. WELL WE HAVE SEEN INCREASED USE OF PROP AND PAP. OUR PROGRESS UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN SLOW AND UNEVEN -- TOO FEW PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE. ON PROP IN PARTICULAR ARE NOT. AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES -- BLACK AND LATINO MEN IN PARTICULAR -- HAVE MUCH LOWER PREVALENCE OF PREP USE. THAN -- WHITE MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN. WE ALSO HAVE CHALLENGES IN OUR TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY OF INCREASING UP TAKE A PROP. MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE AT RISK OF HIV TO ACCESS THESE MEDICATIONS AND REMOVING BARRIERS TO THAT ACCESS. WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA HOPE YOUR PLACE. PREP IS A ONCE A DAY COBB HILL FOR HIV NEGATIVE PEOPLE THAT ALMOST ENTIRELY ELIMINATES THE RISK OF BECOMING INFECTED WITH HIV. PAP IS A ONE TIME TWENTY EIGHT TO A COURSE FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. TO HIV. I HAVE CAN STOP THE HIV FROM TAKING HOLD IN A PERSON'S BODY. AS LONG AS A PERSON STARTS THE MEDICATION WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND HOPEFULLY LESS. OF EXPOSURE. ALLOWING PHARMACISTS TO FURNISH THESE MEDICATIONS AND PUTTING AN END TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS OR BOTH CRITICAL TOOLS TO HELP EXPAND ACCESS. CURRENTLY BOTH PRATHAM TAP A REQUIRE A PHYSICIAN'S PRESCRIPTION -- WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY OR EVEN PREVENT SOME PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING THESE MEDICATIONS. SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE GOING TO SEE A PHYSICIAN. OTHERS STRUGGLED TO ACCESS A POSITION GIVEN THE PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE I IN MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA -- AS WELL AS SOMETIMES HAVING TO WAIT A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE GETTING AN APPOINTMENT THAT DELAYCAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REMAINING HIV NEGATIVE. OR BECOMING POSITIVE. MOREOVER WALT MANY PHYSICIANS GET IT WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL HEALTH. AND THERE ARE SOME POSITIONS MANY PHYSICIANS WHO ARE INCREDIBLE ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH. OTHERS DO NOT. ARE WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE REPORTS ARE FROM PEOPLE WHO GO TO THEIR POSITION -- ASKING FOR PROP. ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THEY SHOULD BE -- JUST QUOTE UNQUOTE MORE RESPONSIBLE. THEY SHOULD JUST USE CONDOMS A AND THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T TAKE A NEW MEDICATION WHEN IT THEY WERE JUST MORE RESPONSIBLE THEY WANT YOU TO PUT UP HELL AND THEIR BODY. PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY ARE STILL GETTING THIS RESPONSE FROM SOME POSITIONS. THREE CLEAR I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT OPPOSITION I WHEN I WENT TO MY OWN POSITION FIVE TO PROP. UP MY PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT LGBT -- GOT IT IMMEDIATELY AND CLEARLY DEEPLY UNDERSTOOD SEXUAL HEALTH. I WAS LUCKY NOT EVERYONE IS SO LUCKY AND FOR MANY PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF REACTION -- THEY'RE GONNA SHUT DOWN AND THEY'RE JUST NOT GOING TO USE -- THIS PROPHYLAXIS. ASKING PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON HOLD WHILE THEY GO THROUGH THE CURRENT LOG OF TRYING TO GET ON TO PROP. WITH RESPECT TO SING A POSITION AND HAVING YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY POTENTIALLY DELAY APPROVAL. ON IT'S JUST NOT THE BEST APPROACH TO PREVENTING HIV. BY ALLOWING PHARMACISTS TO FURNISH AN INITIAL THIRTY DAY SUPPLY OF PREP. AND THE ENTIRE TWENTY EIGHT DAY COURSE OF PAP -- AND THEN FOR PROPERTY WIRING A PHYSICIAN'S PRESCRIPTION TO GO BEYOND THE THIRTY DAYS WILL PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ACCENTS. ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT -- WALL ALTERNATELY CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH ALL OF THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. THIS IS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT LAST YEAR OUR COUNTERPARTS IN NEW YORK STATE. PASSED A LAW ALLOWING PHARMACISTS TO FURNISH THE FIRST SEVEN DAYS A PATH. THAT HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE SEVEN DAYS IS NOT ENOUGH TO CONNECT WITH THE POSITION AND GET THE BLOOD WORK ETCETERA AND SO THERE IS A BILL NOW IN NEW YORK STATE TO EXTEND THE TO TWENTY EIGHT DAYS -- OF COURSE LIKE ALL MEDICATIONS WE'RE ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT PATIENT HEALTH AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF ALL RISKS AND MONITOR THEIR HEALTH. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE PUT WITH THE HELP OF THE COMMITTEE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE STEERED -- TOWARDS OUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE. DO YOU SING NEW HIV INFECTIONS ARE WOMAN TUNING POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IS THE GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION I BELIEVE IT WILL BE THE RESULT -- EXPANDING ACCESS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO BE PART OF COALITION WORKING THE PASSES BE. ONE FIFTY NINE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE CAROLINE CHU. WHO IS A POSITION WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH NETWORK FAMILY HEALTH CENTER?

I STRONGLY BELIEVE PHARMACIST PLAY UNIQUE AND NECESSARY ROLE IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO HIV PREVENTION SERVICES AND ADVANCING PATIENT CENTERED HIGH QUALITY CARE. IN MY EXPERIENCE PHARMACISTS ARE WELL TRAINED AND QUITE EXPERIENCED WITH ENSURING APPROPRIATE SAFETY AND CLINICAL MONITORING REGARDING MEDICATIONS AND PROVIDING MEDICATION ADHERENCE COUNSELING. THUS PHARMACISTS ARE READY WELL EQUIPPED WITH THE CORE SKILLS NEEDED TO SAFELY FURNISH PREP AND PAT. SEVERAL OF MY OWN PATIENTS HAVE EXPRESSED HOW MUCH THEY APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION AND LEVEL OF DETAIL GUIDANCE THEY RECEIVE FROM THEIR PHARMACISTS. ADDITIONALLY AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE THE PHARMACIST I WORK WITH ASSISTED PROVIDERS INCLUDING PHYSICIANS ON ALMOST FOURTEEN HUNDRED CASES INVOLVING PEP AND PROP. ALLOWING FOR THE PHARMACIST TO FURNISH PEPIN PREP HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP US ACCELERATE OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO TURN THE TIDE ON NOT ONLY HIV BUT ALSO OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS.

MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR AMENDMENTS AND STAFF AND THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER. ALEXIS DAILY FROM SACRAMENTO ON GT COMMUNITY CENTER. AND WITH HIS CASTRO. I'M WE ARE STANDING VILIFIED WITH -- THEATER WINNERS. EFFORTS FOR UPRIGHT NAVIGATION AND ACCESS TO PRIVATE RESOURCES ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH OUR MULTI LEVEL MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. OKAY -- ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HE CLEAR A COUPLE SPACES ON THE TABLE HERE FOR THEM TO COME UP WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- FIRST I JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT WENT INTO -- THIS THESE AMENDMENTS AND WENT INTO KIND OF THIS ANALYSIS ON THIS ON THIS BILL AND UNFORTUNATELY IT THOSE HE MADE WILL REMAIN OPPOSED ON AS AN AS PROPOSED AMENDED OR AS THE COMMITTEE MINUTES -- ARE TAKEN WELL WE UNDERSTAND WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE AUTHOR'S GOAL TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF HIV PROBLEM PEPPER STRONG MEDICATIONS THAT DEMAND A HIGH DEGREE OF SAFETY IN CONSIDERATION THAT WE BELIEVE CAN'T BE ACHIEVED AT THE RETAIL PHARMACY -- LEVEL SPECIFICALLY ON CRAFT THE MEDICATION CURRENTLY PRESCRIBED BY PHYSICIANS -- AS A COMPONENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT TO PREVENT A PLAN IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT DETERMINING A PROP REGIMEN FOR PATIENTS IS NOT STRICTLY OBJECTIVE. AND IS BASED ON ONGOING CONSIDERATIONS -- AND DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THEIR AND THEIR PHYSICIANS. CURRENTLY PHYSICIANS THAT HERE TO THE CDC GUIDELINES -- AS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WHEN THEY PRESCRIBE PREP. THEY INCLUDE IT INCLUDES ASSESSING THE PATIENT FOR ANY SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS AND THE QUEUE HIV INFECTION ENSURING THAT THE PATIENT HAS RECENTLY GIVEN A TESTED NEGATIVE FOR HIV. AND CONFIRMING THAT THE PATIENT HAS A NORMAL KIDNEY AND LIVER FUNCTION PHYSICIANS OFTEN WILL TAILOR THESE MEDICATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE PATIENT'S REGIMENT IS MOST EFFECTIVE. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PATIENT'S RISK AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY PRESENT CHALLENGES AND IN PETE AT HERE ADDS TO THE MEDICATION. HAVING PROP AND TO A PATIENT IS MORE COMPLEX THAN JUST FOLLOWING A STANDARD SET OF CDC GUIDELINES. IT'S UNCLEAR AFFIRMS AS THE RETAIL LOCATIONS LIKE FOR CVS AND TARGET WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PAID THE RENT THE PRIVATE SPACE NECESSARY FOR PATIENTS TO HAVE IMPORTANT PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH OF WITH THE PHARMACIST ABOUT THE HIV STATUS AND THE RISK FOR INFECTION. SEE MAY FEELS COMFORTABLE MOVING THE BILL FORWARD IF IT DID NOT AND CAN INCLUDE THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO PROP -- FEELS COMFORTABLE THAN WORKING TOWARD A BETTER ACCESS ISSUE TO UNDERSTAND THE ACCESS OF THE PEP MEDICATION WE UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY BEHIND TAKING PET MEDICATION AS FAR AS NEEDING TO TAKE IT WITHIN THREE DAYS AND HOW THE PHARMACY CAN HELP. ADDRESS THAT BARRIER -- BUT ON THE ON THE PROPER MEDICATION AND WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT IT SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL -- WE DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS BILL AND I WOULD URGE RIGHT WORD ORDER NO VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TREES A STARK WITH KAISER PERMANENTE HEY WE DID HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AS WELL AND WE REALLY WANT I THINK YOU AND AND YOUR STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE SENATOR'S OFFICE IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT. THE BILL IS IS -- DEFINITELY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BUT WE DO STILL HAVE SOME SOME QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS -- ABOUT WHAT REMAINS IN THE BILL AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT KAISER PERMANENTE A STRONGLY SUPPORTS. REMOVING BARRIERS AND EXPANDING ACCESS TO PEP AND PERHAPS WE WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS WORK IN. THE SUPPORTERS ON WHO ARE WORKING ON THAT DEFINITELY -- A SUPPORT THAT AND WE'VE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THESE PROGRAMS IN OUR OWN PHARMACY SO -- BUT WE JUST THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW HOW WE DESIGN THESE PROGRAMS AND I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND WHERE WE STILL HAVE SOME. REMAINING CONCERNS I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT -- AN ISSUE AROUND COVERAGE AND NO THAT'S NOT THE THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE NECESSARILY BUT THE BILL ISN'T VERY CLEAR. ABOUT HOW -- THE MEDICINE AND THE PROGRAM HERE WOULD ACTUALLY BE COVERED -- I THINK THAT'S EASY TO CLARIFY -- AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT IN OUR REMAINING QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS IN THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION -- FIRST OFF WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE PEP AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROVISIONS OF THE BILL I'M LIKE THOSE VERY MUCH -- WE ALSO RECOGNIZE AND COMPLETELY AGREE THAT WE HAVE A UTILIZATION PROBLEM -- WE DO NOT BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THIS BILL IS A SOLUTION TO THAT UTILIZATION PROBLEM. ON BY TAKING AWAY WHAT THE FDA THE CDC OUR OWN STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BEEN SAYING SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN TRUE FATHER WAS FIRST APPROVED FOR PREP -- IGNORE IGNORING THE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OBLIGATION OF THE POSITION TO BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION PRIOR TO THE PRESCRIPTION -- THE CMA REPRESENTATIVE AS INDICATED -- SOME EIGHT SOME GOOD ARGUMENTS RELATIVE TO THIS ISSUE BUT I WANT. TO BRING IT INTO A VERY FINE POINT RELATIVE TO THE HIV TEST. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IS THAT STILL EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. AN HIV TEST TAKEN SOON AFTER SOMEBODY HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO HIV CAN STILL COME BACK IS NEGATIVE. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING WITHOUT A POSITION BEING PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IN THE GUIDANCE OF THE TO THE PATIENT. IS POTENTIALLY PUTTING THEM ON PREP BEFORE THEY HAVE BUT WHILE THEY HAVE TURNED POSITIVE BUT BEFORE A TEST. INDICATES THAT THERE THAT -- THAT THEY'RE POSITIVE AND THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO BE CONSIDERED -- RELATIVE -- TO TO THIS BILL -- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS RELATIVE TO THE THE AMENDMENTS ONE IS -- I THINK IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THE THE PHARMACIES 'MSELVES NOT EQUIPPED TO DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THIS BILL NOW REQUIRES THEM TO DO. INCLUDING AS MORGAN IS INDICATED HAVING A PRIVATE PLACE WHERE A PATIENT A A CONSUMER CAN TALK WITH THE PHARMACIST ON WHAT THE HIV TEST RESULTS WERE WHAT IF IT COMES BACK POSITIVE AND YOU'RE STANDING THERE A WALL GREENS ARE THEY GOING TO TAKE YOU INTO A BACK ROOM SOMEWHERE. AND HAVE PROVIDE YOU THE COUNSELLING THAT WE REQUIRE OF ALL HIV -- TESTING OR OR EXPECT TO ALL HIV TESTING -- IN THIS STATE -- ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE DONE BY THE PHARMACIST -- UNDER THIS BILL ALL BEING DONE WHILE TWENTY PEOPLE ARE STANDING IN LINE WAITING TO PICK UP THERE -- THEIR FOR FLU MEDICATION OR OR WHATEVER ELSE THEY MAY BE THERE I'M THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT -- RELATIVE TO THE THIRTY DAY -- WINDOW IS THAT THERE IS A HOPE OBVIOUSLY IN THAT AMENDMENT THAT THE THIRTY DAYS WOULD GIVE THE PATIENT TIME TO GO TRACK DOWN A POSITION AND GET APPROVED PHYSICIAN'S PRESCRIPTION. I FEAR WHAT'S MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WITHIN THAT THIRTY DAYS WHEN THAT THIRTY DAYS IS UP RATHER THAN GOING TO A POSITION AS SENATOR WINNERS INDICATE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE AND ARE GONNA END UP GOING TO ANOTHER PHARMACY. AND THEY'RE GONNA HOP FROM PHARMACY TO PHARMACY AND GET A THIRTY DAY PRESCRIPTION -- AT EVERY PHARMACY THEY POSSIBLY CAN -- AND NEVER -- IT IT ENGAGE THE SERVICES OF SESSION FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED TO JUST INCLUDE HAPPENED PRIOR AUTHORIZATION THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO REGISTER THEIR OPPOSITION PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS APOLOGIZE FOR NOT GETTING OUR LETTER IN ON TIME IT THE BILL IS CURRENTLY ON OUR OUR MANDATE LIST BUT WE JST WANT TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR -- CLARIFYING THAT DOES NOT MANDATE OUT OF NETWORK SERVICES SO. BOB WEIR POST IN OUR THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS DEMAND REPRESENTED CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. BRENT SPENCER WITH AMERICAN COLLEGE OBGYN IS JUST AT NIGHT IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY WE'RE GONNA BRING THE ISSUE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND NOT COMMENTS AND BEFORE WE BEGIN LET ME JUST MENTION THAT -- BECAUSE THIS IS HAPPENED ON A COUPLE OCCASIONS IN OUR BE A SHORT START OF THE YEAR. FOR ALL YOU FOLKS IF YOU HAVE OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT LETTERS ARE ABOUT POSITIONS YOU HAVE TO GET IT IN EARLY. YOU HAVE TO GET INTO OUR COMMITTEE STAFFER EARLY AT TO GET INTO THE AUTHORS OUR OFFICE EARLY. THAT'S A THAT'S PART OF HOW WE WORK WELL TOGETHER CIVIL A IS -- DON'T SURPRISE PEOPLE. AT YOUR POINT OF YOU OUT THERE SO WE CAN ALL BE CONSIDERED. BOB WILL NOT ON THIS BILL AND OTHER BILLS THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY. I I GET LETTERS THAT I THOUGHT WELL WE COULD TRY TO WORK THESE THINGS OUT BUT IF I DON'T GET THEM UNTIL THE FRIDAY BEFORE HEARING. YOU DON'T GIVE ME REALLY THAT THE ABILITY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT AND FIND A PATHWAY I'M SURE THE AUTHORS -- WOULD FEEL THE SAME SO THAT'S MY LITTLE GRATUITOUS. WILL OBSERVATION I HOPE EVERYBODY WILL WORK HARD -- TO LET AUTHORS NOW AND LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW ABOUT POSITIONS ON ON BILLS AS EARLY AS YOU CAN. OKAY I SEE CENTER LAID HIS HAND UP PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CARE. CENTER WINNER I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I THINK THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE -- MIGHT LOOK AT THIS BILL AND THINK IT IS IS -- JUST AS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BENEFIT THE GAY COMMUNITY BUT WE I'VE HAD AT LEAST ONE IN PARTICULAR A WOMAN IN MY DISTRICT WHO WAS RAPED. AND SHE WAS TOLD THAT THE PERSON THAT RAPED HER HAD HIV THAT THEY LET HER KNOW THAT AND SHE HAD A TERRIBLY HARD TIME. BEING ABLE TO GET THAT THE PRESS. THEY GET THAT RIGHT PRESS YES SORRY. SORRY THANK YOU -- SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE IN ALL COMMUNITIES IT AFFECTS MEN IT AFFECTS WOMEN AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT ACCESS THE WAY I SEE IT WE ALWAYS WANT PEOPLE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING GOOD MEDICAL ADVICE. BUT IF THIS CAN HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD OF AIDS I'M ALL FOR IT THANK YOU FOR REFORMERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND SIR WIENER I APPRECIATE -- OPTING INSTEAD TO CHAT AS WELL -- FOR SO JUST AS CLEAR FIGHT AT THE FOR IT IS ANY PHARMACIST CAN WRITE THIS EARLY PHARMACIST THE WENT THROUGH A CERTAIN TRAINING. THIS WILL BE FOR ALL PHARMACISTS -- THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED ADVANCED PRACTICE FAR RIGHT AS WHICH CONSTITUTES 1% OF PHARMACISTS INSTEAD CALIFORNIA -- SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY -- MAKE THE BILL BORDERLINE NOT WORTH DOING IF 99% OF PHARMACISTS ARE UNABLE TO ACTUALLY PROCESS OKAY SO BASICALLY ANY PHARMACIST ABOUT TO GO TO TRAINING. OKAY SO. HOW MUCH TRAINING THE ON THE THE END OF THE THE ADMINISTRATIVELY THAT WILL BE WORKED OUT? OKAY WE'RE GOING TO MICROMANAGE WHAT THE TRAINING AS BUT IT IT DIRECTS AGENCIES. TO OKAY WELL I GUESS I GUESS WE'LL BUT CERTAINLY -- I THINK ONE OF THE GOALS OF YOUR BILL WHICH I SHARED WE WATCH I IMPROVE ACCESS PARTICULARLY TO THE TOP PART I THINK WHEN I TALK LOW TO BOTH THE GUYS BUT YEAH YEAH I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT WORDS RIGHT OUT YEAH SO -- BUT I AS YOU POINTED OUT THE AND GET AND THE DOES SPEAK TO EXACTLY HOW MUCH TRAINING WOULD BE INVOLVED. AND I'VE NOT LOOKING TO MICROMANAGE BEGINNING A SENSE OF WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PHARMACISTS. WILL. DECIDED TO USE TO DO THAT TRAINING RIGHT SO IS THAT THEN BECOMES THE UNIVERSE'S PHARMACISTS WHO'D BE WHO. TO WHO TO BE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE THESE MEDICATIONS CORRECT. YES YES OKAY YEAH WE'LL HAVE TO IMPORTANT AND AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT STATE CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE. TO IMPLEMENT IT WE WE MIGHT BEEN ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. INCLUDING AROUND HIV AND I'M I'M CONFIDENT WE'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS. OKAY WELL RIGHT SO SO ONE PART IS IS THIS IN TERMS OF OUR THE THE ACCESS PART THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE -- IS -- SO THAT IT DIDN'T IN THE BILL AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT. AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE NEED TO LINK WITH THE PHYSICIAN. RIGHT FOR THE PHYSICIAN SO RIGHT NOW IF YOU YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN YOU SEND THE INFORMATION THERE BUT THE PERSON DOESN'T. AND IF THEY DON'T IF THEY DON'T HAVE ONE THE PHARMACISTS JUST PROVIDES THEM A LIST. AND AND I GUESS. IT TO ME FOR FOR SOME OF YOU DO A LOT IF YOU ORDER SAID ATTESTS OKAY YOU'RE GONNA GET SOME RESULTS BACK. BUT IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO THEY ALSO MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE PROPER TO PAT BUT YOU'RE DOING YES AT A CAN YOU TELL US IN MAY SHOW SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT AND AND AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE SOEONE WHO CAN INTERPRET. THOSE TASKS AND BABY DECIDE WELL MAYBE THAT PATIENT NEEDS MORE FOLLOW UP AND MAYBE IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT. PROPER BABBITT'S ABOUT. SOMETHING CAME UP RATE -- SO -- SO IN MY MIND. ANY WOULD BE GOOD IF THE PHARMACIST ACTUALLY HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A PHYSICIAN OR A GROUP OF PHYSICIANS. TO WHO THEY'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH BEYOND JUST LIKE I'M ON A LIST ALL RIGHT -- BUT WHO WOULD ACTUALLY. PERHAPS MEET WITH THE PHARMACIST GO THROUGH THE LAB RESULTS THEY'VE ORDERS -- TRADE IF THERE IF THERE'S PATIENTS WHO NEED PARTICULAR ATTENTION. SO BECAUSE IT'S MORE I MEAN I REALIZED DON'T WANT CERTAINLY THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS TO TRY TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO THESE MEDICATIONS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF HIV. BUT WE ALSO TO REALIZE PEOPLE AND ONE OF THINGS THAT -- AND PART OF CDC GUIDELINES WHICH I DID REVIEW -- HAS TO DO WITH THE WE HAVE RISING RATES OF STDS -- BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE AREN'T USING CONDOMS BECAUSE THEY FIGURE JUST GOT PROTECT THAT RIGHT THERE'S OTHER BEHAVIORAL THINGS THAT AND THEN YOU COULD PICK UP YOU MEAN PICK UP CERTAIN THINGS -- FROM THE TESTS THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT ESPECIALLY IF THEY DON'T HAVE A REGULAR SOURCE OF PRIMARY OF REGULAR CARE SO. I A ONE BE SURE RETURN WE'RE NOT JUST SAYING WELL ALL ALL WE CARE ABOUT IS THE AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR ATTENTION IS THE HIV PORTION BUT THESE OTHER LARGER ISSUES. THAT GET TIGHT END AS WELL AS ENSURING WE HAVE THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF THE SCREENING TESTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT IS PART OF THE CDC PROTOCOL I MEAN IT'S AND IT'S IT'S SO. THE IDEA OF COURSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THINGS OTHER THAN HIV AND RENO FUNCTIONS AND POOR AND THEN -- TESTING FOR THE MEDIA AND GONORRHEA AND SYPHILIS IS IMPORTANT AS ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE -- PUTTING EVERYTHING IN CONTEXT I AM -- MUCH MUCH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT SOMEONE BECOMING HIV POSITIVE AND BEING POSITIVE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THEN I I MEAN OF COURSE I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO GET GONORRHEA. CHLAMYDIA -- THERE IN DIFFERENT UNIVERSES IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH IMPACT ON SOMEONE'S LIFE. THE RISK OF RENAL PROBLEMS WITH CRAP IS EXTREMELY LOW IT EXISTS AND THAT'S WHY WE EVERY SIX MONTHS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THE THE BLOOD WORK. ON BUT IT IS IN TERMS OF BALANCING -- I THINK -- AND WE PUT CONSTRAINTS IN HERE THAT YOU THAT'S WHY YOU CAN ONLY GET THE THIRTY DAYS -- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO STAY HIV NEGATIVE AND AND THE REALITY IS THAT IN THE SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW. REPORT OF REQUIRING PEOPLE TO GO TO POSITIONS OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS OF ALL OF THE STEPS OF PEOPLE TAKE. WE ARE LOW ON OUR UP TAKE A CERTAIN AGE ON THE ASIAN SO LET ME JUST SAID SO. SO THE E. IF YOU YEAH I'M NOT SAYING THAT -- WE SHOULDN'T GIVE A PRIOR OFF AND SO FORTH I'M SAYING IS THAT. THE THE PHARMACIST. WHO ARE DOING THIS? AT LEAST IN MY MIND SHOULD HAVE AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH A PHYSICIAN ARE A GROUP OF PHYSICIANS THAT THEY WERE NOT JUST A LIST THAT THEY'RE HANDING OUT THAT THEY HAVE THIS. ON GOING RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF SAYING THAT YOU KNOW IN THAT POSITION ACCEPT SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR SO KNOWS I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT. OKAY FINE YELLED WE'RE TRYING TO PROVE ACCESS. THE PATIENT SHOWS UP AT A PHARMACY SAYS THAT. I AM LOOKING THAT THAT BUT THE AN EXISTING RELATIONS VILLAGE THERE'S A TEAM GOING ON HERE RIGHT AND DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT WE NOT TALK ABOUT DOCTOR IN THE PHARMACY WOULD TALK ABOUT RELATIONS FOR THE BUT THAT THAT THAT CAN ACT TO CAN BE. SERVE THERE I'M NOT REALLY BACK UP BUT EING THE OTHER THE THE THE MEDICAL PARTNER TO HELP THEM AND ALSO THAT COULD BE SOMEONE WHO. IN TERMS OF TRAINED DENTIST BY IS THIS SOMEONE WE NEED TO FOLLOW MORE CLOSELY FOR OTHER REASONS -- COULD ALSO BE THE PERSON THEY SAY YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR I'M WORKING WITH THIS POSITION WHO YOU KNOW SEIZEPATIENT. SO SO. TRYING TO FIGURE HOW WE CREATE A MORE INTEGRATED TEAM BASED APPROACH APPROCH THAT AS SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO BE SURE WE HAVE THE FOLLOW THROUGH I THINK THAT'S ONE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE IS THE FOLLOW THROUGH. YEAH AND I HEAR YOU AND I'M GONNA START TO TO TO RESPOND ALSO BUT I ONE THING I DO WANT TO POINT OUT. IS ON AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE -- WHAT I WOULD NOT WANT TO DO IS CREATE A -- APARTMENTS A REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY MAKE THE BILL NOT HAVE VERY MUCH APPLICABILITY RIGHT NOW WE HAD THE THERE IS A MODEL THAT EXISTS YOU HEARD FROM THE IN THE ME TOO PART OF FROM THE OWNER AND PHARMACISTS WHO OWNS MISSION WELLNESS IN SAN FRANCISCO -- WHICH IS A A PHARMACY WHERE THEY HAVE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH PHYSICIANS AND SO IT'S ONE STOP SHOP YOU CAN GO IN AND AND GET YOUR FULL BOTTOM ASTROLOGER BLOOD AND HE GOT ON THE PHONE WITH THE POSITION AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. IT TOOK THEM AMAZING MODEL I LOVE IT THERE'S ONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO COME TO A DAY WHERE THAT IS THE MODEL THAT EVERY PHARMACY IN CALIFORNIA. EMPLOYEES -- I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE -- IF WE EVER GET THERE'S GONNA BE QUITE SOMETIME SO ON I THINK AND AND CONCEPT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- BUT THE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ON HOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT SETTING UP OUR PHARMACIES FOR FAILURE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS LAW BUT ALL. THE REST AUTHORED TO TO TO RESPOND AS WELL. THANK YOU -- I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY I THINK THAT THIS IDEA OF THERE BEING COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PHARMACIES AND PROVIDERS IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY WELL ESTABLISHED AND AS A PHYSICIAN WHO YOU KNOW HAS LIKE TEN FIFTEEN MINUTE VISITS I I REALLY VALUE. THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT CAN YOU KNOW STAY IN TOUCH WITH MY PATIENTS THAT CAN STAY IN COMMUNICATION WITH ME. AND IN FACT I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE VERY EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THIS THAT REALLY IS PROMOTING EFFICIENCY AND A TRULY TEAM BASED MODEL LIKE YOU'RE SAYING -- AND I DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH THE TRAINING THAT WILL BE PROPOSED THAT IT WILL BE STANDARDIZED IT WILL TRAIN THE PHARMACIST TO RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW WHAT IS A NORMAL AND IN THEIR APPROPRIATE STEPS TO FOLLOW UP -- AND THEN ALSO I WANTED TO ALSO MENTION TO SENATOR MADE HIS POINT I THINK THAT WOMEN. HAVE BEEN VASTLY YOU KNOW REALLY -- SORT OF IN THE SHADOWS AND I AND I THINK THAT -- FOR FOR PEPIN PREP ACCESS IT'S EVEN YOU KNOW THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT AND I IF YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO REDUCE YOU KNOW PERINATAL HIV TRANSMISSIONS FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE JUST STILL NOT WHERE WE WANT TO BE -- CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IS ALSO AN ISSUE IN CALIFORNIANS I THINK WITH PREP IF ANYTHING IT HAS REALLY ENCOURAGED ALL OF US TO DO A BETTER JOB OF SCREENING AND I REALLY THINK THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A THAT SOUNDS LIKE US THERE ARE GOOD THINGS. WORK FOR ONE TALKING ABOUT OKAY WELL I UNDERSTAND AND CAN WE WANT TO SEE THE EXACT. PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT YOU CAN IMAGINE IT BEING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF SONG. THUNDERING ON WELL I'M NOT I I DON'T HAVE AN AMENDMENT SAYING INSIGHT ON THIS OR ELSE I MEAN I I THINK WE'RE CONCEPTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE I HOPE FOR COULD BE IN THE SAME PLACE AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE I THINK THE COMMITTEE MINUTES CERTAINLY IF IMPROVE THE BILL. A LOT. TOO THANK YOU SENATOR PAT. ALL RIGHT. THE SENATE ABOUT WINTER BEFORE I LET YOU CLOSE AT MUSIC COUPLE THINGS FIRST THANK YOU TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND AND MANY WONDERFUL SUPPORTERS FOR WORKING WITH ME AND AND MY STAFF. ON THE BILL I WANT TO THANK THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS. WHO RAISED CONCERNS THAT -- THERE ARE THERE ARE -- WISDOM AND INSIGHT I THINK IS -- BROUGHT US TO A PLACE WHERE I THINK THE BILL IS IN. MUCH BETTER SHAPE FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW AND IT'S WHY IT IT JOYS MY SUPPORT -- BUT I WANT TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS IS THAT NONE OF US WANT TO GET. IN THE WAY OF THE PATIENT PHYSICIAN INTERACTION -- THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO AND IF WE COULD -- SNAP OUR FINGERS AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN YOU KNOW WE WOULD WE WOULD SNAP OUR FINGERS AND INSTEAD -- THERE ARE SOME WHO LOOK AT BILLS LIKE THIS AND SAY THIS IS A SCOPE ISSUE WORST GO FIGHT. I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS ANYTHING NEAR THAT AS IT RELATES TO ME. THAT IF THE FOCUS REALLY SHOULD BE ABOUT -- THE PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY FUNDAMENTALLY. AND IS NOBODY DISAGREES WITH THE GOALS REALLY ABOUT HOW YOU GET THERE. AND FOR ME WHAT WAS MOST PERSUASIVE IN TERMS OF THIS LEGISLATION WITH AS AMENDED IS THAT. WE WE WE STILL STAY VERY FOCUSED ON THE CDC GUIDELINES AND ALL THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES. I THAT IN REGARD TO PAP WE'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE IN CRISIS IN A IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS -- AND IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE TO TRY TO CREATE BARRIERS IN FACT WE SHOULD BE DOING THE OPPOSITE WHICH IS THIS BILL PROVIDES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE DO PUT SOME PARAMETERS ON THAT MOMENT OF CRISIS -- A A A A FULL THIRTY DAY OR TWENTY EIGHT DAY -- SUPPLIED TO HELP. TAKE CARE OF THAT CRISIS WITH THE STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT. THAT THEY SEE A PHYSICIAN AND THAT THEY CREATE THE RELATIONSHIP THAT SENATOR PAN YOU AND OTHERS OF HAVE MADE A POINT ABOUT.

THAT DONE MEDICATION -- AND REGARD TO PREP. AGAIN WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THAT FULL EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION TAKE INCORPORATE MANY MORE THINGS THAN JUST HIV -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO BE PRAGMATIC AND AND GIVEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CDC GUIDELINES AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN IMMEDIATE COURSE OF PROP.

A ONE THING I DO JUST WANT TO POINT OUT -- SO SO THERE'S NO CONFUSION -- UNFORTUNATELY I WAS SURPRISED THAT I SHOULD NOT SURPRISE THAT ONE OF THE ORGANIZATION SITTING AT THIS TABLE OPPOSED THE BILL. WAS AN ORGANIZATION CALLED AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IT'S VERY CONFUSING TO MEMBERS I KNOW IN THIS BUILDING BECAUSE PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT IT WHY IS AN HIV ORGANIZATION OPPOSING A BILL -- DESIGNED TO REDUCE HIV INFECTIONS YOU'LL SEE FROM THE SUPPORT LESS BUT OUGHT TO THE CREDIBLE HIV ORGANIZATIONS CITY CALIFORNIA ARE SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING. OF THIS BILL IT'S HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION HAS BEEN A OVER TIME A STAUNCH OPPONENT OF PROP HAS RUN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS TO DISPARAGE PROP. IN CONTRADICTION OF THE ENTIRE REST OF HIV ADVOCACY COMMUNITY -- SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THE CONTACTS SO THAT NO. ONE CONFUSED ABOUT WHY WOULD YOU HAVE IT AN ORGANIZATION THAT SAYS ITS FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE. LIVING WITH HIV IN TRYING TO PREVENT HIV COMMENTED OPPOSE A BILL LIKE THIS -- BUT OUR COLLEAGUES I DO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIBEL. VERY GOOD LOOKING FOR A MOTION FROM THE COMMITTEE SENATOR HILL. THIS HAS MOVED THE BILL AS AMENDED THE SECRETARY WOULD CALL THE ROLL.

WILK HI OKAY CENTER THAT BILL CURRENTLY HAS ENOUGH SUPPORT TO GET OUT OVER A HOLDEN ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH REGULATIONS. RIGHT. NEXT ON OUR AGENDA IS THAT SB ONE NINETY THREE SENATOR NIELSEN WELCOME TO UP THE ANTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS PATIENTS TODAY. THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THIS. ISSUE WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS OF MISTER PATRICK BRIAN [inaudible] HIS SON. IN THE SMOKE SHOP. OUR TOBACCO SHOP. BEGAN TO USE NITROUS OXIDE THESE. THIS NITROUS OXIDE IS CONSUMED. IN A CANISTER. LOOKS LIKE A SMOKING CANISTER BUT IT IS MODIFIED OR BY THEN. THE NITROUS OXIDE CANISTER CAN BE ATTACHED. THE INDIVIDUAL THEN IN JEST THAT. LARA NITROUS OXIDE. THEN IT'S DANGEROUS. MISTER BRYANT SON SHANE. WAS HOSPITALIZED HOSPITALIZED AND HE DID RECOVER [inaudible] ANOTHER HALF. WOMAN NAMED BARBARA. SON HAD THE SAME. DIFFICULTY SHE FOUND TWO HUNDRED OF THE CANISTERS [inaudible] ANDERSON'S POSSESSION. HE WAS USING UP TO THAT MANY. IN A DAY ALL. IT'S A IN THE MEDIA AS I UNDERSTAND IT HI. AND IT DOES HAVE LONG LASTING EFFECTS [inaudible] THE BRAIN. ENTER YOUR LIVES. THE CONCERN IS THAT THESE ARE. AVAILABLE IN. TOBACCO. OR SMOKE SHOPS. AND IT WAS. DISTURBING TO ME. ONE OF MY STAFF WANTED TO GET A BOX OF THESE CANISTERS SO. WE COULD DISPLAY IT TO THE LAST COMMITTEE. WHAT THE CANISTER LOOKS LIKE IN [inaudible] ENQUIRING. WHOEVER WAS WAITING ON HER SHE SAID ARE YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR ME. LIKE MY HEALTH FOR MY AGE -- AND ANY QUESTIONS. AND THE PERSON SAID NO. BUT DON'T YOU WANT TO BUY A LARGER SUPPLY [inaudible] WELL. NOW THAT'S ONLY ONE INSTANCE. ANECDOTAL. BUT I'D CONSIDERED SERIOUS. WITH THIS LEGISLATION WE'RE MAKING IT ILLEGAL FOR AN ONLY. TOBACCO AND SMOKE SHOPS. THIS BOOK WILL ONLY TO THOSE LOCATIONS. THIS WILL BE A MISDEMEANOR. AND THE INDIVIDUAL COULD LOSE THEIR BUSINESS LICENSE. FOR THIS OFFENSE. PEOPLE HAVE DIED [inaudible] OVER THIS. THE CONCERN IS THE SMOKE SHOPS ARE SO INNOCENT. DO YOU GO IN THERE. EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THESE SMOKE SHOPS [inaudible] AND YOU CAN SEE HOW ONE WOULD JUST SWEET WORDS. COULD PROBABLY PROMOTE THE SALE. THESE FIGHTERS OXIDE CANISTERS AND THE ATTACHMENTS THAT COME THE DEVICE [inaudible] IT'S A INDUSTRIAL CREAM DISPENSER WHICH IS A VERY COMMONLY USED DEVICE. WHICH MAKES IT ALSO SEEM MORE INNOCENT. BUT TO ATTACH THEIR TO ARSON TUBES IN BALLOONS. AND THAT'S WHERE THEY THEN INGEST. THIS NITROUS OXIDE. SO I WOULD ASK THE INDULGENCE OF THE COMMITTEE AND I DID NOT BRING THOSE WITNESSES AGAIN TODAY I'VE JUST DECIDED WHAT THEY PRESENTED IN THE LAST HEARING. BUT I DO BELIEVE IT IS A SERIOUS. CONCERN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE OUGHT TO MAKE IT IS UNAVAILABLE. AND AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU CENTERNIELSEN ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN A AND SUPPORT THAT WOULD LIKE TO COME UP. ARE ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. I SEE NOW WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS I SEE. I SEE CENTER RADFORD'S ARRIVE CENTER WELCOME THANK YOU LIKE TO CALL YET TO PRESENT SB FIVE NINETY FIVE GREAT TIMING MY FRIEND. THANK YOU. AND FIRST LET ME THANK YOUR STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN ANALYSIS AND I WANTED STATE THEN I'M ACCEPTING THEY'LL AMENDMENTS. SB FIVE NINETY FIVE WHICH WILL ENABLE INDIVIDUALS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES PARTICIPATING CALIFORNIA'S LEGALIZE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. SPECIFICALLY SB FIVE NINE FIVE WILL HELP ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF CREATING THAT KNOCKED THE BALL INDUSTRY. MARK CORN STATE LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE A FEEDER FOR ALL OR WAIVE THE FEE TO OBTAIN OR RENEW A STATE LICENSE FOR LOCAL EQUITY. APPLE APPLICANTS IN LICENSEES. CITIES SUCH AS OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO LOS EARNED IN SACRAMENTO HAVE CREATED THEIR OWN EQUITY PROGRAMS WAS FOCUS ON INCLUSION IN SUPPORT APPLICANTS THAT HAVE. BEEN MOST HARMED BY THE DECADES DECADES LONG A LONG WAR ON DRUGS LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED MY BILL SB NINE THREE TWELVE NINETY FOUR THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS EQUITY ACT WHICH PROVIDED FUNDING THROUGH THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO A STOP TO EQUITY PROGRAM. SB FIVE NINE FIVE BILLS UPON OUR WORK LAST YEAR TO PROVIDE TO DIRECT SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE FACING THE TOUGH AS BARRIERS TO ENTRY. THE COST OF AN APPLICANT TO SECURE A STATE CANNABIS LICENSE CAN REACH TENS EVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OFFER THOSE. THAT MAY BE OUT I'M SORRY FOR THOSE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OPERATING PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF PROPS SIXTY FOUR A BEEN A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTED BY THE CANNABIS PROHIBITION THESE COSTS ARE INSURMOUNTABLE SO. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS BEEN THE NATIONAL LEADER ON A MANY ISSUES AND WHILE WE'RE NOT THE FIRST STATE TO LEGALIZE ADULT USE CANNABIS WE ARE ON THE CASA BEING THE FIRST STATE TO DO IT RIGHT. BY INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY PREVIOUS POLICIES THAT HAVE FAILED ENTIRE SEGMENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY SB FIVE NINETY FIVE WILL HELP GROW OLD TO ME I SHOULD SAY WILL HELP GROW AND AND DIVERSIFY CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT A SMALL BUSINESSES. BENEFIT COMMUNITIES DEVASTATED BY PROHIBITION INCREASE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY BY ENCOURAGING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN OPERATING ILLEGALLY TO ENTER THE LEGAL AND REGULATED MARKET WITH ME TODAY AS PROCEED A COULD YOU. ATTORNEY FOR THE MINORITY CANDIDATES BUSINESS ASSOCIATION I WANT THANK IN ADVANCE AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD YOUR FIRST WITNESS. HONORABLE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME -- TO Là HERE FROM THE MINORITY CAMPUS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. WE ARE THE FIRST NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR REGULATED CAMPUS BUSINESS OPERATORS FROM MINORITY COMMUNITIES -- NCBA STRONGLY SUPPORTS SB FIVE NINETY FIVE AND ASKS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. OUR INDUSTRIES MINORITY ENTREPRENEURS CONTINUE TO COMPETE ON A VERY UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD. THIS IS THE RESULT OF DECADES OF RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THE ARREST AND PROSECUTION OF CANNABIS OFFENSES. THESE DISPARITIES OF NOT ONLY HARM THOSE WHO ARRESTED PROSECUTED INCARCERATED BUT IT ALSO GREATLY CHILL PARTICIPATION IN THE INDUSTRY BY PEOPLE OF COLOR GENERALLY. SUCH THAT THEY RARELY EVER ENJOY A FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE IN THE NEARLY REGULATED CANVAS STATE CAMPUS MARKETS. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE IN INDUSTRY CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY WELL ESTABLISHED PLAYERS WHO WERE NOT AFFECTED BY SUCH DISPARITIES. AND ENTERED THE INDUSTRY EARLY -- BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF LEGALIZATION AND REGULATION. AS A DRUG POLICY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE HAVE SHOWN THESE DISPARITIES ARE NOT MERELY PERCEIVED BUT ACTUAL EVIDENCE BY HARD DATA. ALSO WHEN COMBINED WITH THE CONTINUED FEDERALLY LEGALITY OF CANNABIS THESE DISPARITIES MAKE AN ALREADY TOUGH BUSINESS THAT MUCH TOUGHER FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BREAK INTO. FOR EXAMPLE BANKS OTHER SOURCES OF BUSINESS CAPITAL ARE GENERALLY UNAVAILABLE TO MOST INDUSTRY ACTORS. THIS LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS EXACERBATED FOR ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR BY THE STIGMA IN FEAR CREATED BY DECADES OF UNEQUAL ENFORCEMENT SUCH THAT EVEN SOURCES OF CAPITAL NORMALLY AVAILABLE TO MINORITY BUSINESSES SUCH AS FRIENDS AND FAMILY. ARE NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO JUSTIFIABLY HEIGHTEN FEARS OF INCARCERATION ASSET FORFEITURE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. FINALLY BEGIN THE HIGH COST OF STATE LICENSING AND RENEWAL FEES CREATE AN ADDITIONAL IMPEDIMENT THAT THREATENS TO PREVENT MOST MINORITY CAMPUS BUSINESSES FROM GETTING BEYOND A BUSINESS PLAN. AND LODGING LAWFUL OPERATIONS THAT CAN COMPETE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH OTHER CANNABIS BUSINESSES. WHY THESE FEAR WHILE WHILE THESE FEES ARE TIERED THEY ARE COLLECTED FROM PRE REVENUE BUSINESSES BASED ON EXPECTED REVENUES AND CAN QUICKLY CLIMB INTO THE TENS AND EVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS? AS A SENATOR -- MENTIONED. ALL THIS CREATES MARKET AND REGULATORY CONDITIONS WHICH CONTINUE TO FACILITATE THE ILLICIT MARKET BY STACKING THE DECK AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO WISH TO APPLY FOR CANNABIS BUSINESS LICENSES. FOR THESE REASONS NCBA FEELS THAT MANDATING STATE LICENSING AGENCIES TO CREATE AN EMPLOYMENT APPLICATION AND LICENSING FEE WAIVERS AND DEFERRALS FOR QUALIFIED APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES UNDER SO LOCAL SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS IS NECESSARY IN WARRANTED. THE COUNTER INTUITIVE WE BELIEVE THESE WAIVERS AND DEFERRALS WILL ULTIMATELY INCREASE STATE CAMPUS TAX REVENUES BY ALLOWING NEW REVENUE GENERATING JOB PRODUCING BUSINESSES TO GET OFF THE GROUND. AND COMMUNITIES THAT WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY CANNABIS PROHIBITION AND OTHERWISE OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY NEW CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT DON'T REFLECT AN HONOR THE POPULATIONS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. ANY DEFERRED LICENSING FEES WOULD STILL BE PAID THE STATE LICENSING AGENCIES EXTENDING THOSE DEFERRALS AND ANY WAIVED FEES WOULD BE RECOUP TO THE RESULTING OVERALL INCREASE IN TAXABLE SALES BY THE SOCIAL EQUITY BUSINESSES. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS THE BILL AN EUITABLE CAMPUS INDUSTRY OF REFLECTING THE BROAD DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND ADDRESSING THE HARMS IMPOSE DISPROPORTIONATELY UPON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BY ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO ENTRY SPECIFICALLY UNEVEN ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF BECOMING SUCCESSFUL IN OUR INDUSTRY. ON BEHALF OF MC BE A WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB FIVE NINETY FIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESSES SUPPORT.

HI GLAZER AYE CHIANG ARCHULETA. DOT HI DODD AYE GALGIANI. JOHNNY I STILL FEEL AYE LEYVA. LIVE AYE PAN. CAN I WILK I WILL GUIDE. CENTER THAT HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS GRADUATIONS. NEXT UP BUT THE CENTER JONES HERE SB. THREE EIGHTY FIVE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE COMEDIAN SYSTEM THINKING TO COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. SENATE BILL THREE FIVE MAKE SEVERAL UPDATES TO THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR ACT TO IMPROVE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. MAINLY THIS BILL UPDATES THE PHYSICAL LICENSE A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR RECEIVES FROM THE BUREAU. CURRENT LICENSED INVESTIGATORS MUST HAVE A TRADITIONAL PAPER LICENSE IT LOOKS MUCH LIKE OTHER DC LICENSES. THAT MUST BE POSTED IN PUBLIC VIEW. HOWEVER MUCH OF A PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS JOB TAKES PLACE OUTSIDE OF THEIR OFFICE. THE BUREAU OF SECURITY ON INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES ALSO OFFERS A POCKET CARD. TO PRESENT TO PEOPLE IN THE FIELD. THIS BILL COMBINES THOSE TWO LICENSES INTO ONE PORTABLE LICENSE THE CONTAINS IT INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR CONSUMER. TO VERIFY A LICENSE SUCH AS A PICTURE OF THE LICENSEE AND THE LICENSES EXTRA EXPIRATION DATE. SB THREE EIGHTY FIVE ALSO REQUIRES THE ONLINE DATABASE TO BE SEARCHABLE BY AN INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS NAME. NOT JUST THE NAME OF THEIR COMPANY ENSURES THAT THE PENALTIES FOR ACTING AS A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR WITHOUT A LICENSE ARE CONSISTENT. THROUGHOUT THE BNP CODE. THOSE CHANGES WILL HELP BRING MORE PROTECTIONS TO THE INDUSTRY. AND I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THIS BILL ALIGNS WITH THE UPDATES. BEING MADE THROUGHOUT THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS. WITH ME TODAY REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CALIFORNIA SECEDED LICENSE INVESTIGATORS FRANCIE KOHLER AND JERRY DOESN'T. THANK YOU SENATOR FIRST WITNESS WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M THE PAST PRESIDENT -- A PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION LICENSE INVESTIGATORS I'M ALSO THE CURRENT LET'S TEAR -- WE CURRENTLY HAVE WE TO CURRENTLY GET TWO CARDS WE GET A PAPER LICENSE THAT HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE WE GET A HARD LICENSE THAT HAS A PHOTO WITH NO EXPIRATION DATE. AND PAPER LICENSE OF COURSE DOESN'T HAVE AN OF PHOTO. SO FOR US THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TO PRODUCE OUR IDENTIFICATION CARD WHEN WE DO OUR WORK WE HAVE TO CARRY TWO CARDS WITH US. WE WOULD LIKE ONE CONTEMPORARY CARD THAT HAD BOTH AN EXPIRATION DATE AND A PHOTOGRAPH. SECONDLY THE LICENSE LOOKUP THAT SENATOR JONES IS TALKING ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENED WITH BREEZES THAT WAS ELIMINATED WE USED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK UP A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR BY THEIR PERSONAL NAME? NOW IT CAN ONLY BE LOOKED AT BY BUSINESS NAME. THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR US BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW OUR BUSINESS NAMES IN OUR PERSONAL NAMES THAT'S HOW THEY REFER US REFERS TO OTHERS. AND SO WHEN THAT PERSON SAY FOR ME ATTORNEY GOES TO LOOK TO LOOK UP MY NAME TO SEE IF I'M LICENSED. THEY'RE GONNA ASSUME THAT I'M NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW MY BUSINESS NAME. THEN THE THIRD THING IS -- THERE'S A OUT A LITTLE BIT OF A A CONFLICT IN THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR ACT REGARDING OF ITALY'S FOR UNLICENSED ACTIVITY UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IS A PROBLEM. IT'S A CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUE IT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE WE DEAL WITH VERY VERY PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND SO ARE WE WANT THAT CONFORM TO SO THAT EVERYTHING GREASE OF THE P. I. ACTING THERE'S NO. NO CONFLICT THERE AND CHANGING THE ONE PART OF THAT ACT TO A MISDEMEANOR INSTEAD OF AN INFRACTION TO CONFORM WITH THE REST OF THE ACT. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT ONE IS A CHAIR MEMBERS JERRY DOES MAN UP HALF OF THE SPONSOR THE BILL JUST ADD THAT EACH OF THE POINTS THAT THE THE AUTHOR AND MRS CILLER MENTION ARE THOROUGHLY REVIEWED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WE APPRECIATE.

FOR HEARING SB SIX SEVENTY NINE IT SEEKS TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HELD A MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST. CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER OR PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL COUNSELOR LICENSE FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS IN ANOTHER STATE TO BECOME LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER CURRENT LAW THESE LICENSES -- S. MEET ALL EDUCATION AND SUPERVISED EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS THE BRAND NEW APPLICANT MUST MEET WHEN THEY COME TO CALIFORNIA. EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN LICENSE FOR MANY YEARS OR DECADES IN THEIR HOME STATE. THIS NEW PROPOSAL WOULD HONOR THE EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE AS THE LICENSEE IN THEIR HOME STATE WHILE STILL MAKING SURE THAT THE OBTAIN ADDITIONAL COURSE WORK.

ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE WORKING ON FOR PROPOSALS TO LIFE INCREASE LICENSE PORTABILITY FOR LICENSEES ACROSS STATE LINES. THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW A STREAMLINED PATHWAY FOR AN ACTIVE LICENSE FEE IN GOOD STANDING FROM ANOTHER STATE TO BECOME LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA. THEY WOULD NEED TO TAKE APPROXIMATELY FORTY HOURS OF CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC COURSE WORK AND THINGS LIKE CALIFORNIA LAW AND ETHICS -- CALIFORNIA CULTURES CALIFORNIA CHILD ABUSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- THE BOARD BELIEVES THIS PROPOSAL STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE OF INSURING ABILITY PRACTICE THEIR BILLY RESPONSIBLY AND EFFECTIVELY IN CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE ENVIRONMENT WITH IT WHILE STILL HONORING THE EXPERIENCE LICENSES HAVE AS LONG TIME PRACTITIONERS ANOTHER STATE.

THOSE STANDARDIZED DEFINITION OF A FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS HAVING A STANDARD DEFINITION ACROSS STATE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WILL OUT POLICYMAKERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFERENCE ONE DEFINE WHAT DEFINITION ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND CODES POLICIES ARE CONSIDERED. THE ABSENCE OF A UNIFORM DEFINITION CREATES DIFFICULTY AND DETERMINE EXACT MEASURE OF THE CONTRIBUTION LEASE POLICYMAKERS WITHOUT ACCURATE DATA WHEN IMPLEMENTING SPECIFIC POLICY ISSUES SUCH AS TAX AND ESTATE SUCCESSION. SB FORTY THRILLED TO FIND CALIFORNIA FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES AS BUSINESSES DOMICILED IN CALIFORNIA IN OPERATION FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE.

WE SHARE IS CENTER THINK WE HAVE TIME. TO COMPLETE THIS BILL BEFORE WE BREAK FOR SESSION. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. AND I GUESS IT'LL DEPEND ON US AND WHETHER WE ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS ARE NOT CENTER WILK SO. KEEP THAT IN MIND. ALL RIGHT LET'S SO WELCOME UP SENATOR HILL. SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE ITEM FIVE CENTER HILL WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT MEMBERS OF VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY -- SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE REQUIRES HOSPITALS CLINICS AND OTHER HEALTH FACILITIES TO REPORT ALLEGATIONS OF PATIENT. SEXUAL ABUSE AND OTHER SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO THE APPROPRIATE STATE LICENSING AUTHORITIES WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE CLOSES LEGAL LOOPHOLES THAT CAN ALLOW A SUBJECT OF REPEATED TO SEXUAL ABUSE AND MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS. TO WORK AT A HEALTH FACILITY FOR YEARS BECAUSE THE RELEVANT REGULATORY BOARD IS NOT NOTIFIED BY THE FACILITY OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST A LICENSEE. ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT BY DOCTORS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS MUST BE REPORTED SWIFTLY TO THE APPROPRIATE LICENSING BOARD FOR REVIEW SO THAT REGULATORS CAN DETERMINE WHETHER TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT. CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION JUST BECAUSE AN ALLEGATION IS REPORTED IN NO WAY MEANS THE MEDICAL BOARD WILL AUTOMATICALLY BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION. ALL COMPLAINTS SENT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OUR FIRST REVIEWED BY A DOCTOR ON STAFF TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER ACTION IS EVEN MORE. TO STATE REGULATORY BOARDS CANNOT FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND OTHER CONSUMERS. IF THEY ARE NOT NOTIFIED OF THE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING THEIR LICENSEES. THE FAILURE TO DO SO SHIELDS BAD ACTORS WHILE EXPOSING PATIENTS TO GREATER RISK. AS YOU ALL ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE U. S. C. AND DOCTOR TYNDALL SCANDAL. WHERE THERE WERE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT FOR DECADES? NONE OF THE PRIOR COMPLAINTS WERE REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. THIS IS WHY THE MANDATORY REPORTING WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE MEDICAL BOARD IS ESSENTIAL. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE CMA. STATED IN THEIR LETTER OF OPPOSITION THAT THIS RECALL REPORTING REQUIREMENT FOR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS. ONLY WOULD CREATE YOU SEXUAL ALLEGATIONS ONLY. WOULD CREATE AN ENORMOUS I'M QUOTING AN ENORMOUS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON ALL HEALING ARTS LICENSEES AS WELL AS THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSING BOARDS. EXACTLY HOW MANY OF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE BEING BROUGHT AGAINST THEIR MEMBERS EVERY YEAR IF IT'S AN ENORMOUS [inaudible] BURDEN. IF THERE IS THAT MANY PERHAPS WE NEED TO SHORTEN THE TIME TO FIFTH THE FIVE OR SEVEN DAYS TO REPORT THIS PERHAPS WE SHOULD LOOK MORE CLOSELY. AT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IF MR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IS SUCH AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM AS THEY SAY IT IS. NONE OF THE OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT THIS PROVISION COVERS NONE OF THE OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AT THIS PROVISION COVERS. ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. JUST THE MEDICAL DOCTORS I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY OPPOSITION FROM THE NURSES DENTISTS VETERINARIANS PSYCHOLOGISTS ETCETERA. THAT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO COME THAT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS FIFTEEN DAY REPORTING. TO THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSING BOARD. THOSE PROVISIONS ARE THE SAME. YOU WILL ALSO HEAR FROM OPPOSITION THAT SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE COMPLETELY BYPASSES THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS. PUT IN PLACE FOR HOSPITALS. THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BILL. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE EXISTING PROCESS OF HAVING A PEER REVIEW SYSTEM TO DETERMINE. WHETHER THEY SHOULD REPORT IT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD DOESN'T WORK. AND IS NOT WORKABLE FOR HEALTH CLINICS. ALSO IT DIDN'T WORK FOR THE LEGISLATURE. WE FINALLY CHANGE THAT IT'S NOW TIME TO EXPECT THE SAME OF OUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WE HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE EXAMPLES OF HOSPITALS FAILING TO INVESTIGATE CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. THUS PLACING THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL PATIENTS IN HARM'S WAY. SEXUAL VIOLATION OF A PATIENT BY THEIR PHYSICIAN SHOULD NEVER. SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN. SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE WILL HELP ENSURE PATIENT COMPLAINTS ARE TREATED SERIOUSLY AND INVESTIGATED WITH THE SWIFTNESS THEY DESERVE. MEMBERS WITH RESPECT TO SECTION FOUR IN THIS BILL SECTION. FOUR WHICH AUTHORIZES THE MEDICAL BOARD TO SUSPEND A LICENSE ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS PENDING FORMAL PROCEEDINGS. AS YOU KNOW I CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT ENSURING THAT ANYTHING WE DO TO HELP THE MEDICAL BOARD GET ITS ENFORCEMENT WORKED AND QUICKLY. IS STILL DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DUE PROCESS. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT MY INTENTION TO GIVE THE MEDICAL BOARD NEW UNPRECEDENTED AUTHORITY TO TAKE ACTION SIMPLY BASED ON INFORMATION. I AM WILLING TO STRIKE THIS PROVISION FROM THE BILL IT'S NOT MY GOAL TO SKIP ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT REQUIREMENTS. NOR DO I INTEND TO ALLOW THE MEDICAL BOARD TO HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND THE LICENSE WITHOUT PROPER DUE PROCESS. I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MISTER HAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE INDULGENCE THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER HEALTH. THE FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT PLEASE. MY NAME IS SUSIE CHANGE I AM A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL GRADUATE STUDENT OF USC'S MASTERS OF HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATION. A COST OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND I AM A SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR [inaudible] SO. AS A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL LIVE WORK TO IN SOME OF THE BEST HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS. AND THEY'RE ALREADY COMPLIANT WITH THE MEASURES SUCH AS PROPOSED IN THIS AMENDMENT -- I WANT TO NOTE THAT. MANY TIMES WHEN SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS ARE MADE ACTUALLY MOST THE TIME ANSWERS ALLEGATIONS ARE MADE ABOUT PHYSICIANS -- INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED AND A DECISION MADE WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE REPORTED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS THESE ARE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. AND ALL SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE DOES IS BRING ALL THE YOUR HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN LINE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICES -- WE WE ALL KNOW THAT USC -- THEY WERE NOT IN LINE WITH INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES. AND BECAUSE OF THIS -- I WAS ASSAULTED BY GEORGE TYNDALL IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND I SAW HIM AS A PATIENT -- AND ACTUALLY WHEN I WENT TO THE CLINIC -- IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT -- HIS BEHAVIOR WAS AN OPEN SECRET ALL THE FRONTLINE MEDICAL STAFF AT THE RECEPTIONIST'S THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE THE NURSES THEY ALL TRY TO HELP ME. THEY ALL TRIED TO PREVENT ME FROM SEEING HIM. BUT I SIMPLY DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT THE MONTH IT WOULD TAKE TO SEE -- A FEMALE GYNECOLOGIST AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND ACTUALLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ASSAULT -- THAT'S THAT'S WHEN I SAW EVIDENCE THAT THEY ALL KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING THEY MANY OF THEM CALLED AFTER ME AS I RAN OUT OF THE CLINIC -- THEY THEY SIMPLY GAVE EACH OTHER A LOOK. AND ALL OF THESE. ALL THESE FRONTLINE WORKERS -- KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I'M WITHOUT ANYONE SAYING ANYTHING OTHER AND THEY'LL TRY TO HELP ME. AND I BELIEVE IT IS. BECAUSE OF THESE -- AMBIGUOUS REGULATIONS THAT USC LEADERSHIP CHOSE TO IGNORE ALL THE WARNING SIGNS ON ALL OF THE VARIOUS REPORTING -- THAT CAME FROM THE FRONTLINE MEDICAL STAFF. WE ALL KNOW THAT -- TORSIONAL INTO PRACTICING -- FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS SING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS -- BECAUSE NO ONE LEGAL IN THE LEADERSHIP AT USC TOOK -- ANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY. USC HAS ADMITTED BY THEIR OWN COUNT THAT THEY RECEIVED EIGHTEEN COMPLAINTS -- I'VE SEEN MANY ESTIMATES THAT PUT THE COMPLAINT AT A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER BUT EVEN EIGHTEEN COMPLAINTS -- USC'S. SHORTEN NUMBER IS SEVENTEEN TOO MANY -- SO I'M IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE AN **** -- THAT YOU VOTE YES FOR IT AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MYSTERY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY TO SHARE YOUR STORIES DIFFICULT THAT IT DOES THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU -- THANK YOU. MY NAME'S AUDRY NOW SIGUR I WORK AS A SENIOR DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE VENTURA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WERE BEEN FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I GRADUATED FROM USC LAW SCHOOL IN. NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND I SAW DOCTOR TYNDALL IN. NINETEEN NINETY ONE ONE OF THE EARLIER TELL YOU MY STORY ON A THANK A SURGERY HOLE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN PASSING THE PATIENT'S RIGHT TO KNOW ACT HELP THE HELPING THAT I THROUGH LAST YEAR AND NOW THIS BILL AS BEFORE TWENTY FIVE I BELIEVE IS VERY VITAL. IMPORTANT TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND TO BRING ACCOUNTABILITY OF WHICH WE'VE SEEN NOTHING AT USC NOT ONE PERSON HAS BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THERE'S OVER THERE SEVERAL HUNDRED WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD NOW. IT'S VERY DISTRESSING. OF PATIENT SAFETY AND HEALTH MUST COME FIRST. AND THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES WHICH ALLOW DOCTOR TYNDALL TO ABUSE WOMAN FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS NEED TO BE CLOSED IN THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO DO IT. IF WE LOOK AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES LIKE MICHIGAN STATE. WE KNOW WHY WE CANNOT ALLOW INSTITUTION TO INVESTIGATE ITSELF. IT'S VERY RARE THAT IF YOU INVESTIGATE YOURSELF YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF GUILTY OF ANYTHING. WE KNOW HERE THAT YOU WOULD SEIZE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION IS LEAD TO NOTHING. IT'S YIELDED NO RESULTS WHATSOEVER IN FACT THEY TOLD A FEDERAL JUDGE LAST WEEK THAT THEY DON'T EVEN PLAN TO MAKE IT PUBLIC. AN INVESTIGATION IS NEVER MADE PUBLIC IS PRACTICALLY USELESS. BOTH OF THESE INSTITUTIONS WERE CHARGED WITH CARING FOR THEIR WOMAN STUDENTS FEMALE STUDENTS. AND THEY'VE DONE THE OPPOSITE THEY IGNORED REPEATED COMPLAINTS OVER DECADES. THEY TOLD NO. ONE ON THE U. S. C. THEY ACTUALLY HARBOR DR TYNDALL AND THEY PROTECTED HIM. THE EMPOWER HIM THEY COVER FOR HIM. AND THEY CONTINUE TO COVER UP FOR HIM. AT THIS TIME RIGHT NOW WE CANNOT TRUST THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OR THESE INSTITUTIONS TO POLICE THEMSELVES EVEN WHEN THEY'RE CAUGHT THEY JUST WON'T DO IT. SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WILL REQUIRE INVESTIGATIONS TO COMMENCE IMMEDIATELY IF  DOCTOR SUSPECTED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT NAP WILL PROTECT PATIENTS FROM FURTHER HARM. AND THAT'S WHEN THE FAVOR OF IT. I WILL SAY THIS -- THE FIRST COMPLAINT I'M AWARE OF IT WAS WRITTEN AGAINST USC HAPPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND THAT'S THE YEAR BEFORE I SAW HIM. IN OF A LAW LIKE THIS WAS IN PLACE I MIGHT NEVER HAVE SEEN HIM. AND THEN THE WOMAN WHO CAME AFTER ME FOR THE NEXT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY HIM. THIS IS IT THIS MAKES SENSE THIS BILL MAKES SENSE TO ME. IN MICHIGAN STATE THEY WERE SO BAD AT INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES THAT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR HAD TO BE APPOINTED. TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND IT WASN'T UNTIL A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR WAS APPOINTED THAT THERE WAS ANY ACCOUNTABILITY THERE. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE CONSIDERING. FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR USC WEATHER HAS BEEN NO ACCOUNTABILITY. THESE EXAMPLES PROVE WHY CALIFORNIA NEEDS SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE WITHOUT THIS LAW. SEXUAL ABUSE BUT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WILL CONTINUE IN SECRET NO ONE WILL BE HELD TO ACCOUNT. AND VULNERABLE PATIENTS WILL BE HARMED. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY THAT THANK YOU MISS NAV SINGER THANK YOU FOR COMING FORWARD TO TELL YOUR STORY IT DOES LACK COURAGE TO DO THAT WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. AT CENTER HILL YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED FOR ALL YUR WITNESSES ALL LIKE TO HAVE YOUR NEXT WITNESS AND DO SOME CELLS AND THEY CAN JUST SUM UP THEIR THEIR TESTIMONY THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC HAVING TO AT A CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MIKE MATIC CONSUMER WATCHDOG -- ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AS THE SHOULD NOT BE COLLECTING DUST IN SOME FILING CABINETS SOMEWHERE. LIKE TO COMMAND -- SENATOR HILL AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR PROTECTING AND SEEKING JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OVER OVER THE YEARS -- AND TO BRIEF IT UP AS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORTING COME TO THE MICROPHONE AND DO A NEED. TO BE APPRECIATED I'M JENNIFER SO MOST OF THE MEDICAL FOR CALIFORNIA THE BOARD ACTUALLY A SUPPORTIVE OF THREE OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY'RE APPROVED IS LET'S PROPOSALS. SO WE SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF STRIKES OR COMPREHENSIVE IN FRONT OF SUMMARY. AND THE PROVISION THAT REQUIRES PROBATIONARY LICENSE INFORMATION TO STAY ON THE BOARD'S WEBSITE AFTER APPROPRIATIONS COMPLETED FOR TEN YEARS. AND THE BOARD SUPPORTS A PER VISIT PROVISION REGARDING PHYSICIAN INTERVIEWS TO INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT THE FAILURE OF A LICENSEE AND ABSENCE OF GOOD CAUSE TO ATTEND AND PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERVIEW BY THE BOARD. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THE FAILURE TO BE REPEATED THE WORLD BE TAKING REVIEWING THIS BILL IN TAKING A POSITION ON THE OTHER PROVISIONS AS NEXT BOARD MEETING ON MAY THANK YOU MA'AM BEFORE YOU GO CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR NAME AGAIN. JENNIFER SOMOS OKAY BECAUSE I HAD SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS JENNIFER IF YOU COULD HANG AROUND RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MAP BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS THE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU MATT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. OKAY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION CAN START [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. WELCOME AND WHO WILL BEGIN. OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MEGAN ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. I REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AS THE BILL PUTS IN PLACE THE REPORTING PROCESS THAT WILL CAUSE EXTREME BACKLOG TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. NEGATIVELY IMPACT ACCESS TO CARE AND REYES IS EXTREME CHALLENGES IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION ALL WHILE IGNORING THE CURRENT EFFECTIVE AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PEER REVIEW PROCESS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT AT USC WHERE THEIR CLINIC MANAGED TO FALL OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF PEER REVIEW. INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM DIRECTLY HOWEVER THE BILL CAST AN OVERLY BROAD NET FOR REPORTING WHICH WILL LEVY HEFTY FINES ON PHYSICIANS MEDICAL STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS FOR FAILING TO REPORT EVERY MENTION. RUMOR OR UNSUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WHICH REMAINS UNDEFINED UNDER THE BILL. THE MAY BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO NARROW THE BILL TO ENSURE THE CLINICS LIKE THAT U. S. C. R. WRAPPED IN THE CURRENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BUT IN ITS CURRENT WRITTEN FORM WE MUST REGRETFULLY OPPOSE [inaudible] THANK YOU. RESEARCHER MEMBERS ALEX OFTEN WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION -- WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. ON THOSE AMENDMENTS TO DISTINCT -- AREAS OF CONCERN ONE IS THE WAY IN WHICH THE BILL INTERACTS WITH CURRENT LAW -- FOR EMPLOYMENT SITUATIONS FOR LARGE EMPLOYERS THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LAW ALREADY ON EMPLOYMENT SO WE WANNA KINDA WORK THROUGHOUT HOW THIS INTERACTS WITH THOSE LAWS. THE SECOND PART WHICH IS MORE TRICKY IN IN WHICH WE AGREE THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED. IS -- HOW EMPLOYMENT LAW INTERACTS WITH THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS WE DON'T EMPLOYEE PHYSICIANS THAT CREATES SOME SOME COMPLICATIONS HERE -- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT DISCUSSION AND THIS COMMITTEE THE MEMBER -- HAVE THE COMMITMENT OF THE HOSPITALS TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS A MAN ARMED POLICE THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. GREAT I ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TO MADDEN REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY IN THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS IN OPPOSITION THANK THANK THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARTS THING I WANT TO BRING THE ISSUE BACK -- TO THE COMMITTEE -- I HAD SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS TO THE MEDICAL BOARD IF I COULD. SO WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY THAT SAID THAT -- RUMORS INNUENDO BUT SOMEHOW TRIGGER -- THIS OBLIGATION CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. ANDTHE MEDICAL BOARD DOESN'T HAVE A POSITION THE BOARD GETS OVER TEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS A YEAR AND SO ANYONE CAN CALL MAKE A COMPLAINT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY THAT WE WOULD GET BASICALLY WE WOULD CONSIDER THE INFORMATION A COMPLAINT SO. RIGHT NOW ANYONE CAN CALL IN WITH ANY INFORMATION THEY DON'T HAVE NOPE THEY GIVE US WHAT THEY HAD TO BACK IT UP BUT IT COULD ANYONE CAN CALL IN RIGHT NOW SO THIS WOULD BE THE SAME WAY. IF A PATIENT FELT LIKE THEY HAD SOME SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OR SEXUAL ABUSE THEY WOULD TELL THAT PERSON IT WOULD JUST. BASICALLY BE A WHITE A COMMUNICATION FROM THAT PERSON TO THE MEDICAL BOARD SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE PROCESS YOU GO THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT RUMOR AND INNUENDO WOULD NOT BE THE BASIS IN WHICH USED. HE DOES TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE POSITION SURE SO GO THROUGH OUR NORMAL FOR SOME PROCESS THIS IS JUST ANOTHER TOOL FOR US TO GET INFORMATION. THE ONCE THE INFORMATION CAME AND IT WILL GO THROUGH OUR CENTRAL COMPLAINT UNIT WOULD BE REVIEWED WE WOULD. GET ALL THE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR AN EXPERT TO REVIEW THAT INFORMATION. IF THE EXPERT A PART IN THAT YEAH THIS LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW SOME SERIOUS -- SEXUAL ABUSE OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT TOP AND THEN IT WILL BE FORWARDED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO THEIR INVESTIGATIVE THE HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATION UNIT THOSE INVESTIGATORS WOULD. YOU KNOW INTERVIEW THE PHYSICIAN INTERVIEW ANY WITNESSES -- TO UP TO ALL THE THINGS THEY NEED TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MEET OUR BURDEN OF PROOF WHICH IS VERY HIGH IT'S RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE CRIMINAL AND CRIMINAL LAW. AND SO WENT SO THEY THEY'VE GOT THAT INVESTIGATION TOGETHER THEN IT GOES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. DIDN'T COLLECT ALL THE INFORMATION AND DECIDE THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO FILE AN ACCUSATION THAT'S CALLED THE CHARGING DOCUMENT BASICALLY -- WHERE IT SAYS THAT WE'REGOING TO GO FOR WITH DISCIPLINE SO THERE IS A IT'S THE SAME PROCESS THAT ALL OF OUR COMPLAINTS IT'S BASICALLY JUST ANOTHER WAY FOR US TO GET INFORMATION? THERE'S A AN ASSERTION THAT -- THIS LEGISLATION IF IT WERE TO BE ENACTED WOULD IGNORE THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS. SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE A PEER REVIEW PROCESS AND IN MANY CASES MAYBE IN MOST CASES. AND THIS BILL TRIES TO GET AT THE EXCEPTIONS TO THAT WORKS NOT OCCURRING BUT CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF OF HOW YOU'RE A INVESTIGATION CURRENTLY DOES IT IGNORE THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS. NO SO THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS IS AGAIN AS ANOTHER WAY FOR US THE MEDICAL BOARD TO GET INFORMATION. THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS ACTUALLY REQUIRES IT TO GO THROUGH THE PEER REVIEW BODY TO DO THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION MAKE EM THEIR OWN FINANCE IF THEY TAKE ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT SPECIFIED AHMAD DID THERE IS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THE MEDICAL BOARD. REVIEW PROCESS WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AS THOSE -- WITH ALL THESE OTHER PROCESSES BUT REALLY ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE JUST ANOTHER WAY FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO GET INFORMATION TO START THAT ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION -- IN THE ANALYSIS IT RAISES A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU COULD ADDRESS. A ONE OF THEM IS THE ABILITY OF FIVE FIVE EMPLOYERS. LICENSEES TO KNOW ABOUT THESE OBLIGATIONS. YOU SPEAK TO WHAT YOU DO TO BE ENSURE THAT -- FOLKS -- THAT HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE. TO TO ENFORCE IT CORRECTLY RIGHT SO UNLIKELY DOING ANY OTHER BILLS PASSED WE TRY TO GET INFORMATION OUT TO OUR LICENSEES WHICH I KNOW IS NOT THE TARGET AUDIENCE BUT SOMETIMES WE WORK WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT LIKE WE WOULD WORK WITH THEM. YOU KNOW POSSIBLY THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION OR A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THOSE FACILITIES TO GET INFORMATION OUT WE'VE WORKED IN THE PAST WITH CD PH ON ALL FACILITY LETTERS TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT TO FACILITIES SO WE WOULD USE THOSE RESOURCES TO GET INFORMATION ON THE BEST WAY. WE COULD POSSIBLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. THERE'S THAT SO THE BILL DOES ASSESS -- PROPOSES TO ASSESS SOME FINES. OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU AS IT IS YOUR BOARD HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF FINES THAT ARE PROPOSED I BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL FINES ARE -- EXACTLY TAKEN FROM THE LAW AND EIGHT OH FIVE SECTION THEM. IT'S THE SAME AS THE FINES IMPOSED FOR EIGHT OH FIVE FAILURE TO REPORT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THOSE FINES WERE CHOSEN FROM MY UNDERSTANDING. SO YOU DON'T FIND THOSE FINES TO BE EXCESSIVE UNDER HOW IT HANDLED THESE MATTERS AND THEY ARE IN LINE WITH OTHER FINDS AN EXISTING LAW. SO THERE IS ANOTHER PROVISION -- IN THE BILL THAT'S RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE EXTENDING THE TIME IT TAKES -- FOR THE THE I SO HEARINGS TAKE PLACE FROM THIRTY DAYS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT FOR THAT FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW. I THINK CENTER HAS A SECULAR JUST REMOVE I REMOVE SECTION FOR WHICH INCLUDED THE TIME. FOR THE I SO TWO TWO AND FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME FOR THAT NO LONGER PART OF THE BILL IF IF THAT'S EXACTLY YEAH. THAT'S FINE OKAY VERY GOOD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO ANSWER SOME OF MY QUESTIONS MY COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. I MEAN LOOK AROUND SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND I WANT THANK THE WITNESSES WHO CAME TO TESTIFY -- ACTUALLY -- REPRESSION FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD IT IS REQUIRED BY LAW I UNDERSTAND AS A LICENSED PHYSICIAN THAT WE HAVE TO POST THE MEDICAL BOARD AND THE COMPLAINT NUMBER IN OUR PRACTICES ARE SOME VERSION THEIR OF PRACTICE NOTICE TO CONSUMERS A COMPOSER GIVE IT TO THAT PATIENT OKAY SO PATIENTS THAT. ACCESS TO INFORMATION -- SIR HELLO I YEAH I APPRECIATE WHAT -- SO CAN BECAUSE THERE'S A PENALTY SIGNIFICANT PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO REPORT -- WHAT? CONSTITUTES AN ALLEGATION THAT'S REPORTABLE EDWARDS. IS IT THAT DOES IT IT DOESN'T HAVE. TO DESERT I MEAN CERTAINLY IF YOU RECEIVE THE FORM I A A LETTER SAYING THERE'S OR A IT'S IT'S IT'S OF I'VE BEEN JUST TRYING TO GET AT THE THAT'S WHAT TRIGGERS THE PENALTY -- SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING OFFHAND REMARK AND SAYS WELL I DID MAKE A REMARK THAT CAN TRIGGER PENALTY AND I JUST FUNDS AND GET IDEA ABOUT. THE DEFINITION OF WHAT AN ALLEGATION IS THAT WOULD THEN TRIGGER THE PENALTY IF IT IF YOU FEEL THE REPORT AND AND AND AND FOR AND UNDER THE SPELL. YEAH AND IN TO ME THE THE CONCERN OR THE THE DEFINITION OF AN ALLEGATION OR COMPLAINT IS. IS ONE THAT CERTAINLY NOT IN TERMS OF MEDICAL MALPRACTICE OR UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT THIS IS JUST PACIFIC WE HAVE SOMEONE. MAKES A COMPLAINT FILED THE COMPLAINT OKAY SO SO SOMEONE THAT IT IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN. A VICTIM OF SOME SEXUAL MISCONDUCT SO SO THERE IS SOME I I MEAN I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR ABOUT THERE'S SOME FORMALITY TO THE COMPLAINT AND THOUGH IT'S IT'S NOT JUST A REMARK YOU'D ACTUALLY SEND THE LETTER OR REGISTER SOMETHING WITH THE ORGANIZATION MIND THAT IN OKAY AND THAT'S THE INTENDED. YOU HAVE TO MAKE FILE A COMPLAINT OR MAKE A FORMAL OKAY TO THE EMPLOYER OR THE OKAY NICK OR THE HOSPITAL OKAY AND I ASSUME YOU'D BE WILLING TO WORK ON LANGUAGE ACTUALLY REVISE THAT. THEN THAT WAY THE ORGANIZATION DOES THIS IS OKAY I GOT WE DON'T WANT NOW I NEED TO SEND THIS YOU KNOW. FOR CONTACT THE MEDICAL BOARD AND NOTIFY THEM OKAY SO BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE'S A THE CHALLENGE ABOUT THAT DEFINITION SO. HAPPY TO DO THAT THANK YOU AND IN ALSO WHEN WORKING WITH THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- THERE'S A EASE IN REPORTING AND AND THAT THOSE -- THIS CLARIFICATION THERE AND ALSO HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS SEE IN MAY AND THE ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED. AND I GUESS QUICK QUESTION FOR SAM A I MEAN CENTER HILLS REMOVED -- SECTION THE BILL THAT I THINK WAS PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF BASICALLY SENDING -- PHYSICIAN'S LICENSE BEFORE THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO TO ANSWERED THE CHALLENGES IS -- TO WHAT DEGREE DOES THAT RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU HAVE. SO THAT PROVISION WAS OF A MAJOR AB PROBLEMATIC PROVISION FOR US AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OTHER BEING WILLING TO REMOVE THAT PROVISION. AS IT -- WAS EVEN MORE BROUGHT I THINK THAN EVEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY. PUT INTO THE BILL. SO THAT DOES TAKE AWAY A MAJOR PIECE OF CONCERN AND I THINK. TO YOUR POINT AT SOMETHING ABOUT FILING A FORMAL COMPLAINT TO THE ORGANIZATION REALLY DOES -- IT HELPS GET TO NARROWING I THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH IS ANY. KIND OF IF YOU'RE IN THE BREAK ROOM IN A POSITION OVER HEAR SOMEONE SAY I HEARD SO AND SO GOT A COMPLAINT AGAINST THEM. THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN AYE WE READ IT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD BE PUT SOMEBODY ON THE ON NOTICE THAT THEY HAD TO THEN FILED A REPORT WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. OR THEY'D BE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES. SO I THINK -- THAT TAKES A BIG STEP IN IN. NARROWING THIS IS SO THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT A STANDARD BY WHICH THE PHYSICIANS AND THE OTHER MEDICAL STAFF KNOW WHEN THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT SO I THINK THAT THOSE DO TAKE EXCEPTION OUR DIRECTION. THEY'RE SUFFICIENT STEPS. I HAD TO GET BACK TO THE LIMIT ON THAT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL LET ME SAY THANK YOU CENTER HELL FOR FOR TAKING THOSE STEPS I THINK THOSE IMPORTANT STEPS BUT I CERTAINLY SHARE YOUR GOAL THAT.
