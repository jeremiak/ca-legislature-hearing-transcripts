BUDGET WE'RE CONSIDERING TODAY

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:52.774
IS SLIGHTLY. MORE FISCALLY

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:54.376
CONSERVATIVE THAN THE ONE WE

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:56.611
PASSED LAST WEEK. THE BAD NEWS

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.580
IS THAT THIS BUDGET IS STILL

01:16:58.647 --> 01:16:59.014
STRUCTURALLY YOU'RE

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:00.549

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:06.621

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:08.590
VOTING ON TODAY BALANCES

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:10.325

THROUGH REDUCTIONS IN STATE

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.762
SPENDING BUT INSTEAD. THROUGH A

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.030
COMBINATION OF BUDGETARY

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:18.066
GIMMICKS. SUCH AS DEFERRALS.

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.046
THOSE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THIS

CONSEQUENCES FOR US. IN FUTURE

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:37.319
YEARS. AND I FEAR THAT THE

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:39.121
BUDGET THAT WERE PASSING TODAY

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.288

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.990
DIFFICULT. TO BALANCE BUDGETS

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:44.092

GIMMICKS AND HOPES AND WISHES

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:12.821

GOING TO BE MUCH MORE POSITIVE

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:22.097
THAN WHAT WAS PRESENTED TO US

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.633
THERE IS NO WAY TO RESPONSIBLY

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:27.002
MANAGE OUR STATE THAT THIS IS

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:28.270
NO WAY TO RESPOND TO MANAGE OUR

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:29.971
STATE BUDGET. THIS BUDGET IS

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.740
NOT MAKING THE TOUGH CHOICES WE

ALL KNOW WE NEED NEED TO NEED

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:35.377
TO BE MADE THE FACT THAT HIGH

SPEED RAIL FUNDING IS STILL

01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:39.014
HAPPENING IN THIS BUDGET SHOULD

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:40.248
BE DISCONCERTING TO EVERY

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:41.817
TAXPAYER IN THE STATE.

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:43.652
ESPECIALLY WITH THE CUTS THAT

01:18:43.718 --> 01:18:45.020
ARE BEING PROPOSED TO OTHER

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:46.855
NECESSARY PROGRAMS THE PUBLIC

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:49.458
RIGHTFULLY EXPECTS AND DEMANDS

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:50.792
FOR US TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:53.061
TAXPAYER DOLLARS IT'S MAKE

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:55.297
DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT ARE

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:56.498
NECESSARY GIVEN OUR CURRENT

01:18:56.565 --> 01:19:01.736
BUDGET. YEAH THIS BUDGET. DOES

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:02.804
THE OPPOSITE. IT CONTINUES TO

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:04.706
FIND WAY FOR PRO. THERE ARE

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:05.907
OVER FOR TO MAKE GOVERNMENT

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:07.008
MORE EFFICIENT AND IT INCLUDES.

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:09.478
A BILLION TAX. WHY ARE WE

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:10.879
RAISING TAXES DURING A TIME

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:13.381
WHEN BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES

01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:13.982
ARE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY TO

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:16.785
SURVIVE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:19.221
THAT THIS BUDGET DOES NOT MEET

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:20.822
THE MOMENT THAT IS REQUIRED.

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:22.357
THIS BUDGET ONLY DELAYS THE

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.025
INEVITABLE YOU WILL HAVE TO

COME BACK AGAIN TO PLUG ANOTHER

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.195
BUDGET DEFICIT BECAUSE WE

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:31.133
TO DO. FOR THESE REASONS I

01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:32.667
OPPOSE THIS BUDGET BECAUSE IT

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:34.369
IS NOT BALLOTS IT IS NOT

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:35.670
FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:38.006

01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:07.248
DISTRICTS. THIS PAST WEEK THEIR

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:09.317
RESPONSE IS ALMOST UNIFORM IT

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:19.427
CHAIR IN APPRECIATE THE

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:20.895
GOVERNOR AND THE SENATE FOR

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:26.400
REACHING THIS DEAL THAT. STAYS

01:33:26.467 --> 01:33:29.136
OFF MANY OF THE PAINFUL THE

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:33.107
MOST PAINFUL CUTS. THAT THE- WE

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:35.242
COULD HAVE BEEN FACING A GIVEN

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:36.344
THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:51.926

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:04.905
ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER ALL OF OUR

TO DEAL WITH THIS COVER

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:17.418
NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I UNDERSTAND

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:19.487
WHY THE GOVERNOR FOUGHT ROLE

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:23.524
HARD TO DEVOTE THE OVERWHELMING.

01:34:23.591 --> 01:34:25.593

DEMONSTRATING THE BIGGEST

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:32.633

PROCESS I RAISE IT BECAUSE I

03:11:38.086 --> 03:11:42.457
HAVE RECEIVED. DOZENS OF PLEASE

03:11:42.524 --> 03:11:46.094
FROM PRINCIPLES PERRANCE SCHOOL

03:11:46.161 --> 03:11:47.696
BOARD MEMBERS OF CHARTER

03:11:47.762 --> 03:11:49.965
SCHOOLS IN MY AREA. THERE IS NO

03:11:50.031 --> 03:11:51.499
NEED TO PENALIZE CHARTER

03:11:51.566 --> 03:11:53.368
SCHOOLS HERE. AND THIS IS A

03:11:53.435 --> 03:11:56.504
VERY RECKLESS WAY OF DOING IT.

03:11:56.571 --> 03:11:58.673
I POINT TO UNIVERSITY HIGH

03:11:58.740 --> 03:12:00.909
SCHOOL IT IS ON THE CAMPUS OF

03:12:00.976 --> 03:12:03.311
FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY IT IS

03:12:03.378 --> 03:12:05.380
ONE OF THE TOP CHARTER SCHOOLS

03:12:05.447 --> 03:12:07.916
IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES

03:12:07.983 --> 03:12:10.018
WINNING ACCOLADES OVER AND OVER

03:12:10.085 --> 03:12:11.887
AGAIN. FOR WHAT THEY ARE ABLE

03:12:11.953 --> 03:12:13.588
TO DO WITH THE STUDENTS THAT

03:12:13.655 --> 03:12:16.758
ATTEND. AND THIS TRAILER BILL

03:12:16.825 --> 03:12:18.426
ESSENTIALLY SAYS THEY DON'T

03:12:18.493 --> 03:12:23.231
COUNT. CARVE OUT. PENALIZED

03:12:23.298 --> 03:12:26.368
THIS IS NOT FAIR LEGISLATION I

03:12:26.434 --> 03:12:28.169
ASK THAT YOU EITHER LAY OFF OR

03:12:28.236 --> 03:12:30.872
OPPOSE- FOR THE REASONS THAT

03:12:30.939 --> 03:12:32.574
I'VE JUST SUGGESTED THANK YOU

03:12:32.641 --> 03:12:34.075
THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON

03:12:34.142 --> 03:12:34.576
MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE

03:12:34.643 --> 03:12:38.613
RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM

03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:39.981
SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN

03:12:40.048 --> 03:12:43.818
OPPOSITION- TO THIS BILL

03:12:43.885 --> 03:12:46.121
CERTAINLY. WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR

03:12:46.187 --> 03:12:47.422
AND I THINK IT IS LAUDABLE THAT

03:12:47.489 --> 03:12:49.357
WE'VE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF

03:12:49.424 --> 03:12:52.294
MONEY GOING INTO EDUCATION K.

03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:52.861
THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION IN

03:12:52.928 --> 03:12:54.863
THIS BUDGET. CERTAINLY BETTER

03:12:54.930 --> 03:12:57.098
THAN THE MAY REVISE. THAT WE

03:12:57.165 --> 03:12:59.134
ALL SAW THAT WE WERE ALL

03:12:59.200 --> 03:13:00.268
TALKING ABOUT ON THIS FLOOR WE

03:13:00.335 --> 03:13:01.836
HAD THE COMMITTEE ON THE WHOLE.

03:13:01.903 --> 03:13:04.806
THAT IS A BENEFIT BUT THE

03:13:04.873 --> 03:13:06.141
FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT IS WRONG

03:13:06.207 --> 03:13:07.642
WITH THIS TRAILER BILL IS THAT

03:13:07.709 --> 03:13:08.410
IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE

03:13:08.476 --> 03:13:10.178
PRINCIPLE THAT THE MONEY SHOULD

03:13:10.245 --> 03:13:13.715
FOLLOW THE STUDENT. AND THE

03:13:13.782 --> 03:13:15.250
REASON WHY WE DO THAT IS

03:13:15.317 --> 03:13:15.917
BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

03:13:15.984 --> 03:13:17.852
ABOUT THE KIDS. IT IS SUPPOSED

03:13:17.919 --> 03:13:19.721
TO BE ABOUT THE STUDENTS AND

03:13:19.788 --> 03:13:21.256
ENSURING THAT THEY ARE GETTING.

03:13:21.323 --> 03:13:25.427
WHAT THEY NEED. TO SUCCEED. AND

03:13:25.493 --> 03:13:29.130
INSTEAD IT IT FREEZES THE

03:13:29.197 --> 03:13:31.066
MONEY BASED ON EIGHTY A OF LAST

03:13:31.132 --> 03:13:34.469
YEAR. SO REGARDLESS OF WHERE

03:13:34.536 --> 03:13:38.373
THOSE WHERE THAT KID GOES. THE-MONEY'S FROZEN IT DOES NOT

03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:42.210
FOLLOW HIM OR HER. AND WHAT IS

03:13:42.277 --> 03:13:42.777
THAT WHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT

03:13:42.844 --> 03:13:46.548
SEND. TO THE STUDENTS AND THE

03:13:46.614 --> 03:13:49.551
PARENTS OF THE STATE. IT SAYS

03:13:49.617 --> 03:13:51.386
THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR

03:13:51.453 --> 03:13:53.088
US TO SHORE UP AND PROTECT THE

03:13:53.154 --> 03:13:56.391
INSTITUTION. THE K. THROUGH

03:13:56.458 --> 03:13:58.360
TWELVE INSTITUTION IN THE STATE

03:13:58.426 --> 03:14:01.062
THEN IT IS TO LOOK OUT FOR THE

03:14:01.129 --> 03:14:02.130
KIDS AND WHAT'S IN THE BEST

03:14:02.197 --> 03:14:05.233
INTEREST OF THOSE KIDS. AND

03:14:05.300 --> 03:14:05.900
THAT HAS REALLY BEEN THE

03:14:05.967 --> 03:14:08.069
CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH

03:14:08.136 --> 03:14:12.407
EDUCATION IN THE STATE IS IN IT.

03:14:12.474 --> 03:14:13.675
BECAUSE THAT'S AN INSTITUTION

03:14:13.742 --> 03:14:15.543
THAT AS WE ALL KNOWN AS WE SAID

03:14:15.610 --> 03:14:17.679
SEVERAL TIMES ON THIS FLOOR. IS

03:14:17.746 --> 03:14:20.148
FAILING BLACK AND BROWN

03:14:20.215 --> 03:14:22.183
STUDENTS IN THE STATE. THE

03:14:22.250 --> 03:14:24.352
ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS STILL SO

03:14:24.419 --> 03:14:26.688
WIDE AND WE ARE NOT MAKING

03:14:26.755 --> 03:14:30.025
PROGRESS. AND WE'RE GOING TO

03:14:30.091 --> 03:14:32.560
SHORE UP THAT INSTITUTION TODAY

03:14:32.627 --> 03:14:34.562
LAST LAST WEEK. WE MOVED

03:14:34.629 --> 03:14:39.968
QUICKLY. TO ADDRESS PROP TWO OH

03:14:40.035 --> 03:14:42.537
NINE HAD TO DO IT URGENT HAD TO

03:14:42.604 --> 03:14:43.471
DO THIS TO ADDRESS THIS VITAL

03:14:43.538 --> 03:14:46.074
ISSUE BUT TODAY ON THIS FLOOR

03:14:46.141 --> 03:14:47.542
NOT URGENT TO ADDRESS THAT K.

03:14:47.609 --> 03:14:48.777
THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION

03:14:48.843 --> 03:14:51.146
PROBLEM THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP

03:14:51.212 --> 03:14:53.982
LET'S JUST KEEP SHORING UP.

03:14:54.049 --> 03:14:55.683
THIS INSTITUTION BECAUSE THAT'S

03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:56.317
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IT'S MORE

03:14:56.384 --> 03:14:58.520
IMPORTANT. THEN WHAT'S GOING ON

03:14:58.586 --> 03:15:00.588
WITH THOSE KIDS. MANY OF THOSE

03:15:00.655 --> 03:15:02.624
KIDS ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF

03:15:02.690 --> 03:15:03.291
SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT GETTING

03:15:03.358 --> 03:15:06.428
THE JOB DONE. MANY OF THOSE.

03:15:06.494 --> 03:15:09.664
pIN FRONT OF TEACHERS THAT WILL

03:15:09.731 --> 03:15:13.768
ADDRESS. THOSE CONCERNS. BUT

03:15:13.835 --> 03:15:14.369
THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL TODAY

03:15:14.436 --> 03:15:16.771
SAYS NOW. WE DON'T CARE IF YOU

03:15:16.838 --> 03:15:17.572
WANT TO TAKE YOUR KIDS

03:15:17.639 --> 03:15:18.840
SOMEWHERE ELSE WE DON'T CARE IF

03:15:18.907 --> 03:15:20.075
YOU WANT TO GET A BETTER

03:15:20.141 --> 03:15:21.543
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR KID THE

03:15:21.609 --> 03:15:24.045
MONEY'S NOT GOING TO FALL ON.

03:15:24.112 --> 03:15:24.579
IT'S GOING TO STAY IN THE

03:15:24.646 --> 03:15:29.684
INSTITUTION. I THINK WE REALLY

03:15:29.751 --> 03:15:31.052
NEED TO SERIOUSLY CHECK

03:15:31.119 --> 03:15:33.088
OURSELVES WITH THIS WHY WOULD

03:15:33.154 --> 03:15:34.856
YOU PUT THAT IN THERE WHY WOULD

03:15:34.923 --> 03:15:37.625
YOU CHANGE THE ROLE. THIS SAYS

03:15:37.692 --> 03:15:38.827
THE MONEY SHOULD FALL THE

03:15:38.893 --> 03:15:39.961
STUDNTS THERE IS NO OTHER

03:15:40.028 --> 03:15:43.832
REASON FOLKS. YOU VOTE FOR THIS

03:20:45.666 --> 03:20:48.202
SPEAKER. I RISE IN OPPOSITION

03:20:48.269 --> 03:20:50.938
THIS BILL CONTAINS PROFOUND

03:20:51.005 --> 03:20:53.441
CHANGES TO EDUCATION FINANCE

03:20:53.508 --> 03:20:55.109
THAT WERE DROPPED AT THE

03:20:55.176 --> 03:20:57.845
ELEVENTH HOUR OUT OF THE BLUE-

03:20:57.912 --> 03:20:59.380
WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC

03:20:59.447 --> 03:21:02.417
PARTICIPATION- OR ANY PROCESS

03:21:02.483 --> 03:21:04.786
AS ONE OF THE ADVOCATES FOR THE

03:21:04.852 --> 03:21:05.686
TYPES OF SCHOOLS THAT'LL BE

03:21:05.753 --> 03:21:07.422
MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PUT IT

03:21:07.488 --> 03:21:08.990
IN MY THIRTY YEARS OF CLOSE

03:21:09.056 --> 03:21:10.291
INVOLVEMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA

03:21:10.358 --> 03:21:12.126
STATE BUDGET PROCESS. I'VE

03:21:12.193 --> 03:21:15.630
NEVER WITNESSED SUCH AN

03:21:15.696 --> 03:21:18.533
EGREGIOUS ABUSE. SO WHY IS IT

03:21:18.599 --> 03:21:21.102
THAT SCHOOLS GROW WHAT COULD BE

03:21:21.169 --> 03:21:21.836
BECAUSE THE COMMUNITES ARE

03:21:21.903 --> 03:21:23.771
GROWING. AND IT'S ALSO BECAUSE

03:21:23.838 --> 03:21:25.773
THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. AND

03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:27.909
THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE. OF

03:21:27.975 --> 03:21:29.677
THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT

03:21:29.744 --> 03:21:31.245
ASSIGNED TO STUDENTS BY THE

03:21:31.312 --> 03:21:33.848
DEFAULT OF THE ZIP CODE. BUT

03:21:33.915 --> 03:21:36.217
HAVE TO ATTRACT THEM TO OFTEN

03:21:36.284 --> 03:21:38.319
THROUGH A DESIRABLE PRODUCT AND

03:21:38.386 --> 03:21:40.922
THAT THE SAP OF OUR PUBLIC AT.

03:21:40.988 --> 03:21:42.223
SYSTEM THAT WE CALL CHARTER

03:21:42.290 --> 03:21:44.125
SCHOOLS. THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE

03:21:44.192 --> 03:21:46.360
SECTOR THAT HAS PIONEERED THE

03:21:46.427 --> 03:21:48.095
MODELS OF DISTANCE LEARNING.

03:21:48.162 --> 03:21:49.831
THAT HAVE PROVEN TO BE OF SUCH

03:21:49.897 --> 03:21:52.500
ABOUT. SO WHAT'S THE PRACTICAL

03:21:52.567 --> 03:21:53.768
IMPACT OF THIS WILL GIVE YOU AN

03:21:53.835 --> 03:21:56.070
EXAMPLE OF JOHN ADAMS WHICH IS

03:21:56.137 --> 03:21:59.173
A- FEW SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT.

03:21:59.240 --> 03:22:00.808

03:22:00.875 --> 03:22:01.943
DORADO HILLS LINCOLN IN

03:22:02.009 --> 03:22:04.946

SUPPORT THIS GROWTH IN

03:22:19.193 --> 03:22:20.862
ENROLLMENT IF THIS BILL BECOMES

03:22:20.928 --> 03:22:23.097
LAW JOHN ADAMS WILL ROUTE LOSE

ABLE TO SUPPORT THE ENROLLMENT

03:22:27.335 --> 03:22:28.636
OF THESE NEW STUDENTS. WILL

03:22:28.703 --> 03:22:31.239
ALSO BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE

03:22:31.305 --> 03:22:32.874
FIFTY ONE NEWLY HIRED TEACHERS

WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT AT A TIME

03:22:36.077 --> 03:22:37.512
WHEN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS

03:22:37.578 --> 03:22:39.647
ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT

03:22:39.714 --> 03:22:41.415

03:22:54.762 --> 03:22:56.864

NINETY EIGHT. I KNOW IT'S THE

03:29:13.674 --> 03:29:14.608
TO CREATE A BUT- AND IT'S AN

03:29:14.675 --> 03:29:17.044
AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS WHEN

03:29:17.111 --> 03:29:17.778
YOU'VE GOT SO MANY FACTORS.

03:29:17.845 --> 03:29:19.313
FACTIONS FIGHTING FOR THE

03:29:19.380 --> 03:29:21.782
NICKELS AND DIMES AT A BEER- I

03:29:21.849 --> 03:29:23.817
THINK THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN

03:29:23.884 --> 03:29:24.451
WHAT WE HAD WHEN WE STARTED IN

03:29:24.518 --> 03:29:27.221
MAY. BUT LIKE MOST OF US

03:29:27.288 --> 03:29:28.756
REALIZE IT'S NOT ENOUGH. AND

03:29:28.822 --> 03:29:30.090
WE'VE LEFT OUT SOME IMPORTANT

03:29:30.157 --> 03:29:32.593
PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS- I'M

03:29:32.660 --> 03:29:33.794
HOPEFUL THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO

03:29:33.861 --> 03:29:35.362
HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE. ABOUT

03:29:35.429 --> 03:29:37.264
UNDERPERFORMING SCHOOLS AN

03:29:37.331 --> 03:29:38.933
UNDERPERFORMING CHILDREN AND

03:29:38.999 --> 03:29:40.868
WHAT NEEDS TO DO THAT YOU WILL

03:29:40.935 --> 03:29:42.102
KEEP THAT PASSION. THE

03:29:42.169 --> 03:29:43.871
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND AS AS

03:29:43.938 --> 03:29:45.639
YOU LOOK AT YOUR LEGISLATION

03:29:45.706 --> 03:29:47.007
AND AS YOU FIGHT FOR THE THINGS

03:29:47.074 --> 03:29:48.676
THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT- IT IS

03:29:48.742 --> 03:29:51.045
PAINFUL TO ME TO HAVE ANY CHILD

03:29:51.111 --> 03:29:52.346
NOT. ACTUALLY FUNDED. BECAUSE I

03:29:52.413 --> 03:29:53.747
KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME REALLY

03:29:53.814 --> 03:29:54.882
WONDERFUL SCHOOLS THAT ARE

03:29:54.949 --> 03:29:56.050
WORKING VERY HARD. AND HAVE

03:29:56.116 --> 03:29:57.351
ATTRACTED STUDENTS TO THOSE

03:29:57.418 --> 03:29:58.619
SCHOOLS AND WILL NOT GET THE

03:29:58.686 --> 03:30:00.220
FUNDING NECESSARY TO MOVE

03:30:00.287 --> 03:30:02.690
FORWARD. WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE

03:30:02.756 --> 03:30:04.491
THEM WHEN IT COMES TO AUGUST.

03:30:04.558 --> 03:30:05.359
IN SEPTEMBER IF WE HAVE

03:30:05.426 --> 03:30:07.194
RESOURCES LEFT OVER. WE MUST

03:30:07.261 --> 03:30:09.196
MAINTAIN THAT FOCUS THAT'S

03:30:09.263 --> 03:30:10.831
THERE. YOU'RE ONE OF THE THINGS

03:30:10.898 --> 03:30:12.299
THAT I I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED

03:30:12.366 --> 03:30:13.934
ABOUT THAT WE ARE. WHEN I THERE

03:30:14.001 --> 03:30:16.503
IS A IT. LIKE THE FIRST THING

03:30:16.570 --> 03:30:17.905
WE DO IS WE TALK ABOUT IT SHE

03:30:17.972 --> 03:30:22.142
BEGAN. WE TALKED ALL THOSE KIDS

03:30:22.209 --> 03:30:25.512
ARE BEHIND. AND YET I. COMPASS

03:30:25.579 --> 03:30:27.614
MAYBE NOW WITH EVERY BUT WITH.

03:30:27.681 --> 03:30:28.749
MAJORITY YOU RE. CONCERNING THE

03:30:28.816 --> 03:30:31.218
MY THAT WOULD FOR. BAY LEARNING.

03:30:31.285 --> 03:30:32.119
AND EVERYBODY. THAT THEY DID

03:30:32.186 --> 03:30:33.988
NOT SAY THAT'S GO TO THE KID

03:30:34.054 --> 03:30:35.622
WHO REALLY HAVE THE LEARNING

03:30:35.689 --> 03:30:37.091
LOS. THE ONES WHO ARE BEHIND

03:30:37.157 --> 03:30:39.193
THE ONES WHO WE KNOW HAVE NOT.

03:30:39.259 --> 03:30:40.227
TURNED ON THEIR THEIR THEIR

03:30:40.294 --> 03:30:41.895
REPORT THEIR COMPUTERS TO

03:30:41.962 --> 03:30:43.697
LEARN- AND NOT NECESSARILY

03:30:43.764 --> 03:30:45.099
GIVEN TO THE KIDS. THAT HAVE

03:30:45.165 --> 03:30:47.067
DOING QUITE WELL BUT EVERYBODY

03:30:47.134 --> 03:30:49.603
WANTED THAT MONEY. EVERYBODY

03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:51.338
WAS THAT MONEY. AND SO AS A

03:30:51.405 --> 03:30:52.973
RESULT NO ONE WAS WILLING TO

03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:55.309
SACRIFICE. TO BASICALLY TAKE

03:30:55.376 --> 03:30:56.977
THAT MONEY THAT CAME IN FROM

03:30:57.044 --> 03:30:58.178
OVER. TO TALK ABOUT LEARNING

03:30:58.245 --> 03:31:00.381
LOSS. AND PUT IT IN THOSE

03:31:00.447 --> 03:31:01.782
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVE THE

03:31:01.849 --> 03:31:03.050
GREATEST AMOUNT OF LOS. BECAUSE

03:31:03.117 --> 03:31:04.985
EVERYBODY WANTED AT THAT TIME.

03:31:05.052 --> 03:31:06.120
SO WHAT I HEAR YOU TELL ME

03:31:06.186 --> 03:31:07.521
ABOUT CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT

03:31:07.588 --> 03:31:09.123
GAP. MAKING SURE THAT EVERY KID

03:31:09.189 --> 03:31:10.557
HAS WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF

03:31:10.624 --> 03:31:12.459
WHERE THEY ARE. I KNOW THAT IS

03:31:12.526 --> 03:31:13.961
SOMETIMES JUST EMPTY RHETORIC.

03:31:14.028 --> 03:31:15.629
BECAUSE THEN WHEN IT COMES DOWN

03:31:15.696 --> 03:31:16.864
TO THE CUTTING UP. AND THE

03:31:16.930 --> 03:31:17.831
THINGS THAT ARE DIVVIED UP.

03:31:17.898 --> 03:31:19.299
THOSE KIDS STILL DON'T HAVE A

03:31:19.366 --> 03:31:20.934
VOICE IN ON THIS HOUSE THE

03:31:21.001 --> 03:31:23.270
THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. SO

03:31:23.337 --> 03:31:23.904
I JUST WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU TO

03:31:23.971 --> 03:31:26.607
BASICALLY. KEEP THAT. GOING

03:31:26.673 --> 03:31:29.143
KEEP YOUR COMMITMENT. REALIZING

03:31:29.209 --> 03:31:30.077
THAT WHEN YOU MAKE THOSE

03:31:30.144 --> 03:31:31.945
COMMITMENTS YOU ALSO HAVE TO

03:31:32.012 --> 03:31:33.213
MAKE THE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT

03:31:33.280 --> 03:31:35.549
AS WELL. AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE

03:31:35.616 --> 03:31:37.384
TO LOSE SOMETHING. IN ORDER TO

03:31:37.451 --> 03:31:39.219
GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO. WE

03:31:39.286 --> 03:31:40.988
HAVE NEVER PRIORITIZE KIDS WILL

03:31:41.055 --> 03:31:42.623
BE FINE IN THIS HOUSE. THAT I

03:31:42.689 --> 03:31:45.526
HAVE SEEN. WE TALK ABOUT IT.

03:31:45.592 --> 03:31:47.928
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TALK ABOUT

03:31:47.995 --> 03:31:51.598
ACCOUNTABILITY. CHANGING OUR

03:31:51.665 --> 03:31:52.599
SCHOOL SYSTEM NOTHING NEEDED

03:31:52.666 --> 03:31:53.967
TO. WE GET WE GET WE GET ALL OF

03:31:54.034 --> 03:31:55.836
THE PLACE WITH WHERE WE TO BE.

03:31:55.903 --> 03:31:58.105
WE CAN FIVE EVERY. IN FELL.

03:31:58.172 --> 03:32:00.374
THEN THE EDUCATE. AFTER WE

03:32:00.441 --> 03:32:03.310
BASICALLY GIVE OF DO THINGS. A

03:32:03.377 --> 03:32:09.683
UNIQUE AND REVOLUTIONARY. WILL

03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:10.784
NOT BE WITH THE MOST CRITICAL

03:32:10.851 --> 03:32:11.885
IN. FACING CALIFORNIA AND IS

03:32:11.952 --> 03:32:14.555
NOT COLD IT IT IS. EVERY IN QUE.

03:32:14.621 --> 03:32:16.123
TO THE MAXIMUM. AND WE HAVE

03:32:16.190 --> 03:32:17.191
HAVE GIVEN UP ON THAT SO MANY

03:32:17.257 --> 03:32:19.126
WAYS. SO I'M I'M- IT'S POINT AT

03:32:19.193 --> 03:32:20.761
THE HOUSE WHEN A PLAN. TO

03:32:20.828 --> 03:32:22.696
REALLY BROUGH CAL. EDGE FORWARD.

03:32:22.763 --> 03:32:24.431
I'VE TALKED MANY OF YOU EDUCATE

03:32:24.498 --> 03:32:26.967

THOSE MONSTERS. THOSE LITTLE.

03:32:32.172 --> 03:32:33.440
THOSE GROUPS THAT HOLD YOU

03:32:33.507 --> 03:32:35.209
TIGHT. AND SO AS A RESULT WE'VE

03:32:35.275 --> 03:32:36.944
BEEN. BASICALLY DO WE HAVE TO

03:32:37.010 --> 03:32:38.545
DO. SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL

03:32:38.612 --> 03:32:40.614
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE BEST

03:32:40.681 --> 03:32:41.448
WE CAN GET AT THIS POINT. IN

03:32:41.515 --> 03:32:43.383
TERMS OF US MOVING FORWARD BUT

03:32:43.450 --> 03:32:45.719

THIS WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED I

03:44:16.342 --> 03:44:18.311
REMEMBER THAT DEBATE IN

03:44:18.378 --> 03:44:20.079
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX. ARM

03:44:20.146 --> 03:44:21.614

MEN OTHER PROPERTY AFTER

03:44:22.749 --> 03:44:24.250
MILLION DOLLARS SORT ALWAYS HAD

03:44:24.317 --> 03:44:26.119

AND I WOULD SAY THIS

03:44:36.429 --> 03:44:38.264
FLEXIBILITY ESTABLISHED BY THIS

03:44:38.331 --> 03:44:40.733
LONG CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE

CAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN

03:44:51.744 --> 03:44:53.646

03:44:53.713 --> 03:44:56.616
BY IMPOSING THIS RESIDENCE

03:44:56.683 --> 03:44:57.183
REQUIREMENT DON'T THINK THAT

03:44:57.250 --> 03:45:00.620
MAKES SENSE. I ALSO NOTE THAT.

03:45:00.687 --> 03:45:02.055
