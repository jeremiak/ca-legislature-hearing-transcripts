HAVE SOME CONCERNS. ON

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:44.175
LIMITATIONS OF THAT THE BILL HAS

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:47.879
AND PROTECTING TENANTS AB TWENTY

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:48.379
ONE SEVENTY NINE IS VERY

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.847
SALUTARY IN THAT IT PROTECTS

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:51.983
THOSE WHO HAVE SUBMITTED THEIR

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:53.951
RENTAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION OR

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:56.487
WHO WILL DO SO BY THE END OF THE

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:58.856
MONTH. AND ANYBODY WHO HASN'T

00:35:58.923 --> 00:36:01.459
HEARD THIS FROM ME AT. OR FROM

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:03.194
UC UP MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:05.062
HERE TODAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:07.498
IF YOU WANT RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:09.166
GET THAT APPLICATION AND BY THE

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:10.902
END OF THE MONTH THERE'S ONLY A

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:12.637
FEW DAYS LEFT SO I WANT TO

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:15.439
ENCOURAGE. PEOPLE TO DO THAT-

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:18.009
THERE ARE MORE THAN THREE

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:18.676
HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS THAT

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:22.380
ARE STILL WAITING ON PAYMENT-

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:26.083
AND TO- I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.818
THE KIND OF SLOWNESS WITH WHICH

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:30.121
THE SAP PROGRAM AS HAS HAS

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:33.758
ROLLED OUT BUT THE- MEASURE

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.459
DOESN'T PROTECT THE MILLIONS OF

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:36.527
TENANTS WHO ARE ON THE BRINK OF

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:38.629
RECEIVING AFFECTION NOTICES.

00:36:38.696 --> 00:36:40.765
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE RENT-

00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:43.234
AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:45.036
TO A WEEK HAD TO MISS CONNELLY

00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:47.038
FROM THE COUNTY OF LA BUT ALSO

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:49.540
SAN FRANCISCO SAN DIEGO RICHMOND

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:51.909
AND FRESNO HAVE ADOPTED EVICTION

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:53.678
PROTECTIONS FOR NON PAYMENT OF

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:55.279
RENT. THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:58.215
EFFECT ON APRIL FIRST AND THIS

00:36:58.282 --> 00:36:59.717
BILL WOULDREVERSE THOSE VOTES

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:01.586
AND TAKE AWAY THE PROTECTIONS-

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:03.154
THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING FOR

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:06.123
THOUSANDS OF TENANTS- OUTSIDE OF

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.558
THE ONES WHO WERE HELPING HERE

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.760
TODAY. ALSO THE BILL DOES NOT

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:10.861
INCLUDE AN EXTENSION OF THE

00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:12.396
APPLICATION FOR RENTAL

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:15.166
ASSISTANCE AND I FEAR THAT THERE

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:18.536
ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE-

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:19.804
BECAUSE OFFOUGHT LANGUAGE

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.173
DIFFICULTIES OR OTHER- ISSUES

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:23.908
WILL NOT HAVE SUBMITTED AN

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:27.278
APPLICATION- TENANT ADVOCACY

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:28.813
GROUPS IN FACT HAVE NOTED THAT

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.648
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. OF

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:33.284
NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS WHO HAVE

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:34.619
NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THE

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:39.023
APPLICATION AND THEREFORE WILL

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:39.690
NOT BE GETTING. RELIEF SINCE THE

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.258
START OF THE PANDEMIC SHERIFF'S

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:42.727
DEPARTMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:46.197
CARRIED OUT. OF ALREADY AT LEAST

00:37:46.263 --> 00:37:47.865
TEN THOUSAND LOCKOUTS AND WHILE

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.600
THE MEASURE IN FRONT OF US WILL

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:52.236
HELP. OF MANY TENANTS MY CONCERN

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.205
IS THAT WE WILL SEE THOUSANDS

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:56.207
MORE LOCKOUTS AND EVICTION CASES

00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:58.509
IF NOTHING MORE IS DONE THEN

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:00.411
THEN THIS BILL SO AGAIN I WANT

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.579
TO THANK THE AUTHORS. FOR THEIR

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:03.514
HARD WORK ON THIS I KNOW THIS IS

00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:05.516

CERTAINLY SHARE MR BLOOM'S.

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:28.939
FRUSTRATION BUT I THINK. A BILL

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:30.207
THAT WOULD PASS THROUGH THIS

00:38:30.274 --> 00:38:32.343
COMMITTEE MAY NOT. THE SOMETHING

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.744

00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:36.447
OTHER HOUSE AND THROUGH THE REST

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:38.582
OF THE PROCESS I THINK WE DO

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:39.750
NEED. TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT.

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:42.019
