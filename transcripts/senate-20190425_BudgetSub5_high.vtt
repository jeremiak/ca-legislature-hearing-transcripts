BOTH LEGISLATION AND LITIGATION

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:13.733
THAT HAS RESULTED IN A

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.334
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN.

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:17.403

SUITABILITY HEARING.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:19.939
I'LL START WITH TIME USE

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.675
OFFENDERS YOUTH OFFENDERS --

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:25.511
SENATE BILL A TWO SIXTY ONE AND

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:26.846
ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN AWAIT

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.047
WHICH EXPANDED THE YOUTH

OFFENDER LAWS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.118
OLDER WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:32.885
CRIMES.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.587
NOW DETERMINEDLY SINCE YOUTH

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:35.788
OFFENDERS WHO COMMITTED THEY'RE

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:37.757
THEY'RE CONTROLLING OFFENSE

THOSE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES HAD --

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.570
TO DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION.

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:52.138
WE FOUND SECIFICALLY WITH THE

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:54.273
IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWO SIXTY

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.042
THE FIRST YOUTH OFFENDER LAW.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.543
THAT DETERMINEDLY SENTENCED

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.412
YOUTH OFFENDERS IN PARTICULAR

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:02.615
WERE IN OR NOT -- VERY WELL

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.784
SUITED FOR PAROLE -- WE KIND OF

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.118
COIN THE PHRASE THAT IT'S REALLY

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.887
NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SURPRISE

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:08.521
SOMEBODY WITH THE PROFITABILITY

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:09.121
HEARING.

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:10.890
SO THEY WERE NEVER EXPECTING TO

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:13.326
COME BEFORE THE BOARD THE I'M

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:14.794
NOT BEEN PROGRAMMING AND THEY

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:15.928
DIDN'T REALLY THINK THAT THEY

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.198
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO AFFECT

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.566
THEIR FUTURE.

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:23.636
AND SO WE WORKED WITH -- THE

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.805
LEGISLATURE BACK THEN TO PROVIDE

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.039
SOME ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THOSE

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:28.407
FOLKS TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:29.475
PROGRAMMING.

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:30.476
I'M PREPARE FOR THEIR

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:31.811
PROFITABILITY HEARINGS AND

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:32.945
ULTIMATELY WHAT HAPPENED WITH

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.413
BOTH OF THOSE BILLS IS THAT THEY

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.815
GAVE THE BOARD.

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:38.150
AND THE INMATES AND TELL THE END

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:40.119
OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO GET

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.287
EVERYBODY ON CALENDAR WHO IS

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.855
ELIGIBLE FOR HEARING WHEN THOSE

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.056
BILLS TOOK A FACT.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:45.992
SO WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:46.592
HUNDRED DETERMINEDLY SINCE YOU

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:47.793
THE VENDORS THAT WE NEED TO GET

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.463
ON CALENDAR BY THE END OF TWENTY

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:51.330
TWENTY ONE WE COULD HAVE HANDLED

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:52.965
DIED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.867
RESOURCES -- THE WAY THE BOARD

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:56.269
WORK WE HAVE TO HAVE THREE

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.371
PERSONS ON A PANEL UNLESS WE

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:00.806
HAVE A BACKLOG IN WHICH CASE WE

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.108
CAN USE 2% ANNALS.

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:04.343
THE WAY OUR HEARINGS FLUCTUATE.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.712
WE CAN WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:07.914
LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM AS TO

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.849
WHEN WE SCHEDULE SOMEBODY FOR

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:11.550
HEARING AS WE TRY TO MANAGE THAT

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:12.852
AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE WE

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.388
PROBABLY COULD HAVE WITH FIFTEEN

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.055
OUR CURRENT FIFTEEN

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:17.356
COMMISSIONERS.

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:18.391
HANDLE THAT WORKLOAD.

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:20.359
HOWEVER WHEN THE IN RAY EDWARDS

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:21.928
DECISION WAS DECIDED AND WE

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.195
ENDED UP IMPLEMENTING

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.898
REGULATIONS FOR NONVIOLENT

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.233
INDETERMINATE LICENSE IN MAINE.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.901
PRIMARILY NONVIOLENT THIRD

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:30.036
STRIKERS.

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:32.538
THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRO

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:33.739
SUITABILITY HEARING AFTER

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.574
THEY'VE SERVE THE FULL TERM OF

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.076
THEIR PRIMARY OFFENSE.

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.512
AND THAT WAS A CHANGE IN THE LAW

00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:42.181
WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED PROPOSITION

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.649
FIFTY SEVEN WE THE STATE ONLY

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.451
EXTENDED IT TO DETERMINEDLY

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.286
SENTENCED OFFENDERS.

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:50.756
THE COURTS CAME BACK AND SAID NO

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:51.357
THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:51.958
UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:54.226
REQUIRES US TO ALSO PROVIDE A

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:58.097
PAROLE -- PROCESS FOR NONVIOLENT

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:59.498
INDETERMINATE LICENSE OFFENDERS.

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:04.036
WE DID OUR PROJECTIONS OF ABOUT --

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.738
FOUR THOUSAND NONVIOLENT -- INTO

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.940
TERMINALLY SENTENCED OFFENDERS

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:08.507
WHO WERE INCARCERATED AT THE

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:09.442
TIME.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:11.644
AND WE THOUGHT THAT OUR

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:14.213
PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT ABOUT TWO

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.814
THOUSAND WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.282
ELIGIBLE FOR NEW HEARING FOR

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:17.116
HEARING.

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:18.884
SO WE HAD ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:19.852
AGAIN THAT WE NEEDED TO GET ON

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.922
CALENDAR AND THE REGULATIONS THE

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:25.691
COURTS WERE NOT VERY -- THEY

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.560
WERE NOT VERY PATIENT -- WITH

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:28.661
THE IDEA OF HOW QUICKLY WE

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:29.862
SHOULD GET THESE FOLKS ON

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.098
CALENDAR AND SO WE'VE BUILT THE

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:35.134
REGULATIONS SO THAT IF THOSE

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:35.735
FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN DOWN THE

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:36.802
LONGEST.

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:38.204
I'VE BEEN INCARCERATED LONGEST

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.672
WOULD GET HEARINGS FIRST THEY

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:41.407
GET A PRIORITY HEARING -- BY THE

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.876
END OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.578
THE REMAINDER WOULD HAVE A

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:46.912
HEARING BY THE END OF TWENTY

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.347
TWENTY ONE THAT KIND OF PUTTHE

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:49.248
BOARD OVER THE EDGE.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.217
I'M AN ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:52.685
HEARINGS ON TOP OF ALL OF OUR

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.287
OTHER HEARINGS -- WAS MORE THAN

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:56.589
WE COULD HANDLE WITH OUR CURRENT

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:58.391
PANELS.

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:01.093
IN ADDITION -- ANYTIME THAT WE

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.661
CONDUCT MORE HEARINGS IT

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:04.196
GENERATES MORE FEATURES.

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:05.531
AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IF

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:08.300
SOMEBODY HAS A RECEIVED A THREE

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:09.702
YEAR DENIAL ONE YEAR.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.303
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.172
TO ADVANCE OUR NEXT HEARING DATE

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:14.940
TO A TIME THAT'S EIGHTEEN MONTHS

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:16.308
FROM THEIR LAST HEARING.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.577
SO ANY TIME THAT WE PUT ON MORE

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:19.812
HEARINGS.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.480
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE RESULT IN A

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:22.681
THREE YEAR DENIAL.

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:24.250
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THOSE

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:26.218
ARE THEN PUT BACK ON CALENDAR

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:27.186
EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER.

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:28.154
SO THIS IS CAMILLE WOULD HAVE A

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.321
FACT THE MORE HEARINGS WE

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:31.857
SCHEDULE THE MORE HEARINGS IT

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:34.360
ENDS UP KIND OF SNOW BY

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:35.161
SNOWBALLING BLACK BETTER.

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:37.530
ON FUTURE YEARS AND SO WE ARE

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:39.031
ESTIMATING THAT THE NUMBER OF

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:40.433
HEARINGS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:41.500
ADD BACK INTO OUR HEARING

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:42.968
CALENDARS RESULT OF ADVANCED

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:45.071
HEARING DATES. TO OUR OWN TO

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:47.273
RESPOND PAY PROCESS AND AS A

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:49.108
RESULT OF PETITIONS THAT INMATES

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:50.342
IN FILE TO ADVANCE OUR NEXT

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.211
HEARING DATES -- IS ROUGHLY

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:54.914
ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND SO IT'S

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.615
KIND OF THREE EQUAL INCREMENTS.

00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:59.485
AND SO FOR US -- THAT'S A LOT

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:03.956
MORE SO WHEN FACED WITH THE THE

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:05.524
IDEA OF DO WE WANT TO EXPAND THE

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.093
BOARD BY 40%.

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:08.561
WE ALREADY HAVE FIFTEEN BOARD

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:13.799
MEMBERS AND IT SEEMS IS IT'S THE

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:16.502
BOARD OPERATES WE FIRST LOOKED

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.136
TO SEE IF WE CAN DO THINGS MORE

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:18.804
EFFICIENTLY -- WITHIN OUR

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:21.574
EXISTING RESOURCES AND SO WE SAT

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.908
DOWN AND WE STARTED REALLY

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:24.143
THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE DO

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.712
THINGS DIFFERENTLY IT WAS NOT TO

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:28.314
COME IN FOR WITH A RESOURCE

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.816
REQUEST THAT WOULD BE -- PRETTY

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:33.419
SIGNIFICANT -- AN UNPRECEDENTED

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:34.653
THE BOARD TO BE EXPANDED THAT

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.122
MUCH IN ONE YEAR.

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:38.791
SO WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING -- WITH

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:41.827
OTHER JURISDICTIONS FOR A HOW

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:45.264
THEY HANDLE THEIR HEARINGS AND

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.766
WE FOUND THAT -- STRUCTURE

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.502
DECISION MAKING SOUNDED LIKE IT

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:51.370
WAS GOING TO BE A VERY GOOD

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.905
OPTION FOR THE STATE.

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:54.573
AND WITH THE USE OF STRUCTURED

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.408
DECISION MAKING WE BELIEVE THAT

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:58.911
WE CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE THE SAME

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:01.113
QUALITY DECISIONS.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.782
AND THE HAVE INCREASE THE

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:05.451
TRANSPARENCY IN THE CONSISTENCY

00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:06.919
IN OUR DECISION MAKING.

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:09.021
AND ALLOCATE LESS TIME PER

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.056
HEARING -- FOR ALL OF OUR

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:12.625
SCHEDULED HEARINGS.

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.193
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO ADDRESS I

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.728
APOLOGIZE I'M GONNA BOUNCE

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:16.829
AROUND A LITTLE BIT.

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:17.997
OF WITH.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:20.199
IN THE INCREASE IN ATTORNEY'S

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.334
FEES THAT WE CAN PAY BOARD

00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:23.869
APPOINTED COUNSEL.

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:26.872
ALONG WITH EXPECTATIONS THAT WE

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:28.174
PLAN TO BE PUTTING IN PLACE. TO

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.676
GO WITH THAT INCREASE IN FEES WE

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.211
THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.546
THE QUALITY OF ATTORNEY

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:35.548
REPRESENTATION WHICH CAN ALSO

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:37.116
HAVE A PRETTY DRAMATIC IMPACT ON

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:38.450
OUR HEARING CALENDARS GOING

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:39.618
FORWARD.

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:41.387
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:44.857
SOMEBODY IS FACING A AT THREE A

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:46.358
MINIMUM THREE YEAR THE NILE.

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:48.227
AND YET THEY CAN THEY CAN

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.563
VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR HEARING

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:52.031
FOR A YEAR.

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:53.365
WITH NO FOR ANY REASON.

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.700
IF THEY THINK THAT THEY MAY BE

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.835
MORE LIKELY TO BE SUITABLE IN

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:58.837
THE VERY SHORT TERM THAN A YEAR

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:00.940
THEY CAN WAIVE THEIR HEARING

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:01.907
FORTY FIVE DAYS IN ADVANCE OF

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:02.975
THAT HEARING.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.377
AND NOT GO FORWARD WITH THEIR

00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:08.147
HEARING AND NOT RISK HAVING A A

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:10.616
LINK TO YOUR DELYLAH MARCY'S LAW.

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.084
RIGHT NOW OUR FEE SCHEDULE IS

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.619
SUCH THAT WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.354
TO GO TO HEARING.

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:17.022
ATTORNEYS GET MORE MONEY IF THEY

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:18.490
ACTUALLY GO TO HEARING.

00:14:18.557 --> 00:14:20.459
AND IN TALKING TO IN MAKE

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:23.028
COUNSEL AND INMATES AND ADVOCACY

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:24.463
GROUPS WE KNOW THAT.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.499
BOTH THE MERIT OF AN ATTORNEY --

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:28.667
REPRESENTING THESE INMATES IN

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:30.836
THESE IN THESE HEARINGS IS A

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:32.438
PREPARATION WORK THAT THEY DO

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:34.039
WITH THOSE THAT WITH THE INMATES.

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:35.808
AND SO THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE THE

00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:37.810
FEE SCHEDULE IS A LITTLE BIT --

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:39.745
IT INCENTIVIZE IS WE THINK OF

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.780
BEHAVIOR THAT WE PROBABLY DON'T

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:44.383
WANT TO INCENTIVIZE -- WE WANT

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.718
TO LOOK AT INCREASING THEIR FEES

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:48.187
BUT ALSO RESTRUCTURING HOW WE

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:49.255
PAY.

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:52.758
WE LOOKED AT SEVEN COUNTIES AND

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:55.127
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SEE

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:57.096
HOW MUCH THEY PAY DEFENSE

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:59.431
COUNSEL -- PER AND OUR AND THEIR

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:02.434
MAXIMUM CAP FOR CASE -- WHEN

00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:04.837
DETERRENT WITH LOOKING AT -- HOW

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:06.272
MUCH DO THEY?

AND THE COURT TO COME UP WITH A

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:22.047

NOT ONLY INCREASING THE FEES BUT

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:26.085
WHAT THE FEE SCHEDULE LOOK BY.

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.720
AND ALSO PUTTING IN -- NEW

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:30.022
EXPECTATIONS THAT HOPEFULLY WE

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.623
CAN MONITOR AS WELL AS A

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.559
TRAINING PROGRAM WE'VE TALKED A

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:34.827
LOT ABOUT.

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.829
HOW UNCOMFORTABLE AND

00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:38.764
POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE IT IS

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.199
FOR THE BOARD TO BE TRAINING TO

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.568
NOT ONLY HIRE COUNSEL TO

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.002
REPRESENT PEOPLE THAT COME

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.671
BEFORE THE BOARD?

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.973
BUT THEN ALSO TRAIN THEM.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.842
AND VERY THAT SAID IT'S NOT A

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.877
VERY GOOD POSITION FOR US TO BE

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:54.113
AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:56.081
POTENTIALLY CONTRACTING WITH AN

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:59.017

A LAW SCHOOL ONE WHO HAS A LOT

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.622
OF EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY TRAINING

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.391
ATTORNEYS TO REPRESENT LAW

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:07.659
STUDENTS TO REPRESENT PEOPLE

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:08.727
BEFORE THE BOARD.

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:11.163
AND HAVE THEM PROVIDE THAT KIND

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.099
OF ADVOCACY TRAINING THAT WOULD

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:14.733
BE KIND OF INAPPROPRIATE FOR US

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.367
TO DO.

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.035
SO HOW COME WE HOPE WE THINK

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:18.437
THAT'S GOING TO COME TOGETHER

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.105
AND REALLY HELP -- ARE HEARING

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:22.441
CALENDAR BUT ALSO IMPROVE THE

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:24.309
PREPARATION INMATES WILL RECEIVE

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.711
FOR THEIR THEIR PROFITABILITY

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:27.780
HEARINGS THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:29.081
COMPONENTS.

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.417
A IN ADDITION TO EVEN IF WE

00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:33.118
INCREASE OUR CALENDARS USING

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.653
STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING MORE

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.356
HEARINGS PER PANEL PER DAY.

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.958
I'M WE STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:42.528
RESOURCES TO HANDLE THE INFLUX

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:44.263
OF HEARING SO WE'RE ASKING OF

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.597
THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND OUR

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:47.132
BOARD BY TWO PERSONS THAT GIVES

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:48.467
US THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE ALL

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.202
THOSE SCHEDULED HEARINGS.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:52.838
WITH THE INCREASED CALENDAR

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:55.407
USING STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING.

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:56.742
THE OTHER RESOURCES THAT WERE

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:57.876
ASKING.

00:17:57.943 --> 00:18:00.012
FOR IN ADDITION.

00:18:00.078 --> 00:18:03.015
GIVE AN EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WE WE

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:05.217
RECEIVED OVER FORTY THOUSAND

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:06.819
PIECES OF CORRESPONDENCE -- IN

00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:08.053
CONJUNCTION WITH ALL OF OUR

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.888
PAROLE HEARING PROCESS SEES.

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:12.491
AND WE RESPOND TO THOSE TO ALL%

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:14.059
ABOUT CORRESPONDENCE WE ALSO

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:15.828
HAVE TO SEND OUT HEARING NOTICES

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:17.162
UNDER THE LAW.

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:18.464
WE DO THAT ALL ELECTRONICALLY

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.998
NOW BUT I STILL HAVE STAFF THAT

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:21.300
HAVE TO ACTUALLY PUT ALL THAT

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:23.669
TOGETHER -- MAIL THEM OUT TO THE

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:24.870
PEOPLE THAT WANT THAT MAILED OUT

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:26.872
EMAIL AMOUNT TO THE FOLKS WHO

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.373
WANT TO RECEIVE THEM VIA EMAIL.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.976
AND SO ANYTIME WE INCREASE OUR

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:32.978
HEARING THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:34.646
THAT ARE GOING TO BE SCHEDULED.

00:18:34.713 --> 00:18:38.917
IT RESULTS IN SOME -- ADDITIONAL

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:41.153
DUTIES FOR OUR ADMINISTRATIVE A

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.255
SAID OUR OFFICE ASSISTANCE OUR

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:45.524
OFFICE TECHNICIANS AND OUR

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:46.925
ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:49.661
ANALYSTS SO WE WENT THROUGH AND

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:51.697
WE FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:53.499
CATEGORIES WE TRY TO MAKE THEIR

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:54.733
PROCESSES AS EFFICIENT AS

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.834
POSSIBLE.

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:58.036
SO THAT WERE NOT REQUESTING A

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:00.339
38% INCREASE WE WERE ABLE TO

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:01.106
COME UP WITH SOME ECONOMIES OF

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:04.910
SCALE AND ACTUALLY -- NOT

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:07.479
REQUEST -- THAT SIGNIFICANT IN

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.714
GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS IT'S NOT

FOR US. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:14.953

PERIOD OF TIME.

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:33.431
THE OTHERS TO SAFETY VALVES THAT

00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:36.935
IS THE INMATE'S ABILITY TO

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:39.537

MOTIONS RESPONSE THEY CAN

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:49.381
ADVANCE SOMEBODY'S HEARING DATE.

00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:51.516
AND WE HAD NOT PRIOR TO IN RE

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:53.518
VIC'S WE HAD NOT DONE THAT WE

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:55.220
DID NOT HAVE A PROCESS FOR

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:56.554
ADVANCING HEARING BATES ON OUR

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:57.689
OWN MOTION.

00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:59.858
AND SO WE LOOKED AT ALL THE US

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:02.093
SUPREME COURT CASE LAW BEHIND IN

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.095
RADIX OR THAT WAS CITED CONVICTS.

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:06.431
AND THEY TALK A LOT ABOUT PAROLE

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:11.670
HEARING A PROBOARDS -- KIND OF-THEY WERE ASKING OR SUGGESTING

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:12.504
THAT WOULD BE IN THE BEST

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.905
INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC IF

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:15.307
PROBOARDS WOULD FOCUS OUR

00:26:15.373 --> 00:26:17.108
RESOURCES ON THOSE WHO ARE MOST

00:26:17.175 --> 00:26:18.310
LIKELY TO BE FOUND SUITABLE.

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:20.045
SO WHEN WE SAT DOWN AND FIGURED

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:22.447
OUT HOW WOULD WE PUT TOGETHER --

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:23.815
WHAT WE WERE HOPING TO BE AN

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.216

IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:28.320
LIKELY BE FOUND SUITABLE?

00:26:28.386 --> 00:26:30.055
AND THEN REVIEW THOSE FILES ON

00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:32.090
OUR OWN MOTION WHAT WE DECIDED

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:33.658
WAS WE WOULD LOOK AT EL ALL

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:35.126

00:26:43.034 --> 00:26:43.935
VIOLATIONS SINCE HER LAST

00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:44.703
HEARING.

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:46.071
RIGHT NOW WE LOOK AT THEM AT

00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:47.339
ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE LAST

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:49.240

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:52.344

ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER TO SEE AND

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:01.786
THEN THEY GET ON CALENDAR

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:04.155
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER WHICH IS.

00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:04.756
IT'S SLIGHTLY UNDER THE THREE

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:05.557
YEARS.

00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:07.592
NO ACTUALLY IT'S EIGHTEEN MONTHS

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:08.426

STATES ARE FROM THE LAST HEARING

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:12.063
SO IT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. ONE

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.064
OF THE THINGS IS KIND OF

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.666
IMPORTANT WE HAVE HEARD --

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:17.068
CRITICISM -- THAT OUR

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.570
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS

WON'T GET THEM BACK ON CALENDAR

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:21.673
YEAR AFTER THE LAST HEARING

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.742
IMPAIRED MARCY'S LAW THE MINIMUM

WITHIN A YEAR GRANTED IT'S RARE

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:32.817
IN AS A SUPREME COURT SAID.

00:27:32.884 --> 00:27:34.152
I'M THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:35.787
ARE AMENABLE TO THAT KIND OF

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:37.689
CHANGE -- IN A SHORT PERIOD OF

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.591
TIME THEY THE EXAMPLE THEY GAVE

00:27:39.657 --> 00:27:41.526
WAS PEARL PLANS OR SOMETHING TO

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:42.627
THAT EFFECT.

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:44.229
WE CAN NO LONGER DIE SOMEBODY

00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:45.630
BASED SOLELY ON THE LACK OF

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:47.165
PAROLE PLAN SO THAT IS KIND OF

00:27:47.232 --> 00:27:48.299

SUITABLE FOR PAROLE WILL GIVE

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:55.807
THEM A GRANT AND THEY WILL GO TO

00:27:55.874 --> 00:27:57.142
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SO.

00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:59.044
THOSE KIND OF SHORT TERM FIXES

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.944
HAVE KIND OF GONE TO THE WAY

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:02.614
SIDE RIGHT NOW EIGHTEEN MONTHS

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.748

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.517

IT'S BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:11.689
EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:12.891
IN THEIR LAST HEARING DATE IT'S

00:28:12.957 --> 00:28:14.192

COME BEFORE US.

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:20.165
SO WE'VE KEPT THAT PROCESS IN

00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:22.867
PLACE AND IT'S IT'S A REALLY

00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:25.904

2023% IF YOU WANT AROUND OFF.

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:10.548
BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAY

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:13.718
THAT THEY WOULD WHEN I SAY THAT

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:15.720
THEY THINK THAT AUTOMATICALLY.

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:18.189
MY GOSH MATH 7078% OR DENIED

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:19.991

HEARINGS THAT RESULT IN A GRANT --

00:29:33.972 --> 00:29:35.974
SCHEDULED HEARING CAN RESULT IN

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.175
A POSTPONEMENT A DENIAL

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:39.577
STIPULATION A CANCELLATION A

TAKE OUT ALL THE ONE IF YOU TAKE

00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:46.384
OUT EVERYONE IF YOU ONLY LOOK AT

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.520
CASES WHERE A DECISION WAS MADE

00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:49.687
SOMEBODY WENT TO A HEARING AND

00:29:49.754 --> 00:29:51.356
THEY WERE EITHER GRANTED OR

00:29:51.422 --> 00:29:51.823
DENIED.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:56.494
PAROLE THE GRANT RATES 39%.

00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:58.229
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT I'D LIKE

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.932
ABSOLUTELY LIKE BACK.

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:01.866
BECAUSE WHEN I BASS THE

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:04.068
DEPARTMENT.

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.137
AND IN GIVEN NUMBERS.

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:08.206
MY NUMBERS WERE ALWAYS BY BASED

00:30:08.273 --> 00:30:10.742
ON YOUR MATERIALS YES MEAN

00:30:10.808 --> 00:30:12.143
EIGHTEEN AND 22% NOW THE REASON

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.212
I'M GONNA RAISE THIS AND CLEARLY

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:14.812
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING NOW IS

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:15.880
THAT.

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:18.183
SOME NUMBER OF THOSE PEOPLE IN

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:20.151
THE SEVENTY ODD THAT AREN'T.

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:20.985
COULD.

00:30:21.052 --> 00:30:23.555
COULD END UP BEING RELEASED

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:24.989
WITHIN A YEAR.

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:26.991
MIND WHATEVER BUT IF WE LOOK.

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:30.128
THIS WE JUST LOOK AT MARCY'S LAW.

00:30:30.195 --> 00:30:30.895
AND WE SAY ALL RIGHT.

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:32.397
YOU.

00:30:32.463 --> 00:30:36.201
IF WE SCHEDULE. FIVE THOUSAND

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:38.369
AND WHAT.

00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:42.340
DOES THAT WE WILL BETWEEN -- FOR

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:45.176
TO UPWARDS -- SEVEN THOUSAND

00:30:45.243 --> 00:30:46.744
HEARINGS IN THE YEAR.

00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:51.249
LET'S SAY WE HELD.

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:52.450
FIVE THOUSAND IN OUR RATE 18%.

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.152
RECALCULATE THAT ARE RELATED

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:57.689
REALLY THE LEAST ON THAT IS 18%

00:30:57.755 --> 00:31:00.091
AND THAT MEANS FIVE THOUSAND

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:02.594
HEARING. 18% THAT MEANS THERE'S

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.029
NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT A MAN.

00:31:05.096 --> 00:31:06.564
FORTY ONE HUNDRED DON'T.

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:08.466
THOSE FORTY ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE.

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.835
STILL GO BACK IN OUR SITUATION

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:12.136
AND THEN STILL WOULD HAVE.

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:14.472
OR ANOTHER PRO BOARD I'M GETTING

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.673
INTO THIS.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:20.311
RIGHT NOT AS THE AS A REFLECTION

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:22.780
OF WHETHER.

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:25.016
MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE.

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.718
DIDN'T HAVE RATHER.

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:27.652
SO.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.020
IF THOSE FORTY ONE HALF HUNDRED

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:30.555
PEOPLE.

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:32.657
AFTER WAIT THREE YEARS.

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.325
THE COST TO THE STATE IS ONE

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:36.294
POINT TWO BILLION.

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:40.331
AS WELL THAT'S THREE HUNDRED

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:41.532
THOUSAND AND OF COURSE THERE ARE

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:44.202
SERRATION COST IS A LITTLE LESS

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:45.536
BUT IF WE AND THAT.

00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:48.172
WILL COST YOU BROKE PROCESS

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:48.473
[inaudible]

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:49.707
OUT.

00:31:49.774 --> 00:31:50.441
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:50.742
[inaudible]

00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:52.777
NOW.

00:31:52.844 --> 00:31:55.580
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME NUMBER OF

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:58.016
THOSE. FORTY ONE HUNDRED REALLY

00:31:58.082 --> 00:31:59.817
SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED PAROLE SO

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:02.587
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET.

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:03.154
YOU KNOW WE'RE NEVER GONNA.

00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:05.323
HAVE.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.158
ROLE FOR EVERY PERSON WHO GOES

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:07.392
BEFORE.

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:10.395
BUT IF WE YOUR THAT THERE SOME

00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:16.167
HIGHER PERCENT -- ACTUALLY.

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:18.002
UNDER UNDER AGREED UPON

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:19.570
OBJECTIVE CRITERIA.

00:32:19.637 --> 00:32:20.905
COULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:22.807
EITHER WARN ADEQUATELY PREPARED

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:23.608
OR DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:26.678
REPRESENTATION OR WHO KNOWS WHAT.

00:32:26.744 --> 00:32:28.413
THEN THE COST TO US IS WHITE THE

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:30.014
COST TO THE STATE IS QUITE

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:31.883
SIGNIFICANT.

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:33.217
I'M AND I JUST RAISE THIS

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:37.221
BECAUSE I THINK AS WE DELIBERATE.

00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.924
IN ADDITION TO CLEARLY THE LANDS

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:42.126
OF PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE LANDS OF

00:32:42.193 --> 00:32:43.528
MAKE -- WERE DOING THINGS.

00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:44.896
APPROPRIATELY AND EFFECTIVELY

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:46.064
WERE ALSO MAKING SURE WE'RE

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.699
DOING THINGS.

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:49.067
SMARTLY FROM A COST.

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.501
WHEN YOU VIEW [inaudible]

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:53.338
I'M.

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:54.706
ANYWAY I JUST WANTED TO RAISE

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:56.407
THAT AND IF WE INCREASE THE

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:57.942
NUMBER OF ROLE HEARING.

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.811
AND WE STILL HAVE A LOW RATE SO

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:01.979
WE GET UP TO SEVEN THOUSAND YEAR

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.581
AND LET'S SAY WE EVEN GET 230%

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.183
UNDER.

00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:06.050
SEVEN THOUSAND WE'RE STILL GOING

00:33:06.117 --> 00:33:07.785
TO BE ASKING US.

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:09.354
IN THE ORDER OF ONE POINT FIVE

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.891
TWO BILLION -- IT'S REAL.

00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:15.360
IT'S VERY RELEVANT TO US IT'S

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:16.761
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WE DO

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.096
BELIEVE THAT INCREASING THE

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:19.063
QUALITY OF ATTORNEY

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.998
REPRESENTATION IS OF REALLY

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.166
SIGNIFICANT.

00:33:22.233 --> 00:33:25.269
A MOVE FORWARD IN IN HELPING

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:26.771
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:29.440

PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK SOME

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:38.716
PEOPLE -- I THINK THAT EVERYONE

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:39.350

EVERY WEEK FOR TWENTY SIX WEEKS

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.070
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:00.972
COMMISSIONER AVAILABLE.

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.173
AND IT WAS THROUGH NO FOUR OF

GOVERNOR I MEAN THEY WERE ALL

BOARD BY TWO PERSONS.

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:33.037
WE THINK THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:33.905
HANDLE THE HEARING LOW

00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:34.205

I CAN USE THAT COMMISSIONER TO

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.863

WELL AND EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:40.238
THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO

00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:41.305
WHAT THEY DO.

00:35:41.372 --> 00:35:44.275
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:45.042
HEARINGS BEFORE IT.

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:47.378
I'M HEARINGS ARE VERY.

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:48.179
I GO TO IT.

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:50.581
ON FRANCIS WITH OTHER PAROLE

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:53.317
RULING AUTHORITIES FROM. THIRTY

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:54.752
THIRTY STATES ARE MORE AND

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.020
SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:57.288
I'VE YET TO FIND A SINGLE

00:35:57.355 --> 00:36:00.057
JURISDICTION HAS THE HEARINGS

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:01.025
THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS THAT WE

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:01.559
DO.

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:03.895
AND THAT -- SPEND AS MUCH TIME

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.763
AS WE DO TERMINATING --

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.065
PROFITABILITY SO WE'RE HOPING

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:11.035
THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING-RULES WILL SHORTEN THE HEARINGS.

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:12.970
AND HAVE THEM FOCUS ON WHAT IS

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.171
MOST IMPORTANT.

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:16.307
THE ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION IF

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:18.009
IT IMPROVES WILL HELP WITH BRING

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.610
FOR HEARINGS YOU MAY SEE MORE

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:21.279
PEOPLE FOUND SUITABLE IF THEY'RE

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:25.850
PREPPED -- WELL BEFORE -- THERE

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:26.784
IS THERE HEARINGS.

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:30.187
I'M WE JUST DON'T KNOW -- AND OF

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:30.721
COURSE.

00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:31.088
I BROUGHT UP.

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:31.989
THE DOLLARS BUT THE OTHER ISSUE

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.758
ISIF THERE ARE PEOPLE

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:34.058

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:35.860
THAT.

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:40.331
WHERE SUITABLE WHO ARE NOT?

00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:42.433
WONDER OUR CURRENT PROCESS EVEN

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.267
A SMALL PERCENT WERE ACTUALLY

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:47.672
FOUND -- THEN WE WHOLE.

00:36:47.738 --> 00:36:49.240
NOT ONLY IS IT US WEST.

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:53.177
IT ALSO WERE UNDER ORDER TO OUR

POPULATION AND A CERTAIN NUMBER.

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:59.016
IT THEN END PROCESS AFTER YOU.

00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:00.718
MAKE OTHER DECISIONS OR MAKE

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:03.821
OTHER COMBINATIONS THAT.

00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:05.089
YOU KNOW IF IT COULD.

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:06.924
AND SHOULD LEAVE BE [inaudible]

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.326
BETTER FIX [inaudible]

00:37:08.392 --> 00:37:10.294
IN THIS [inaudible]

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:11.896
THIS WENT [inaudible]

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:13.965
PURSES BROUGH.

00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:15.566
OTHER WAYS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:16.701
GET OUR POPULATION [inaudible]

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:19.503
I'M.

THERE.

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:26.711

WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.064
LOGIC FOR THE SHORT TERM

I'M.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.368
STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:25.403
FRAMEWORK.

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.571
I WANT TO SEE IT I WANT TO SEE

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:29.940
AND I WANT TO SEE EVALUATIONS OF

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:32.009
IT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT OTHER

[inaudible]

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.545
I'M.

THAT I HAVE ANY PREJUDICE

AGAINST IT BUT I CERTAINLY IS.

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:41.385
ALL.

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:43.888
THE WOMEN ON GIVEN THAT ALL I

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:44.088
HAVE.

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:47.958
IS THE FOUR FIVE THAT IS IN A

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:50.895
DARK.

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:53.064
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW THE SEVEN

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.099
STATES WITH SEVEN STATE.

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:56.067
I CAN'T THIS OHIO CONNECTICUT

00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:57.468
SOUTH DAKOTA WASHINGTON KENTUCKY

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:58.703
IN UTAH.

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:01.305
I'M IN IT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:03.441
FRAMEWORK OR THE NATIONAL

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:04.742
INSTITUTE OF CORRECTIONS HAS

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:06.777
ADOPTED IT AS A BEST PRACTICE

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:08.746
AND SO IT'S BEEN TAILORED FOR

00:39:08.813 --> 00:39:10.081
EACH OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:12.717
ADMITTEDLY THOSE JURISDICTIONS --

00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:14.151
DO NOT HAVE A LIBERTY INTEREST

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.686
IN PAROLE.

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:18.389
AND SO IN CALIFORNIA I'M OUR DUE

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:20.224
PROCESS RIGHTS ARE MUCH

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:22.493
DIFFERENT -- PAROLEES THAN THEY

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.828
ARE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:25.796
THE BEST ANALOGY IS THE NATIONAL

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.698
PAROLE BOARD OF CANADA THEY ALSO

00:39:27.765 --> 00:39:28.599
HAVE A LIBERTY INTEREST IN

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.668
PAROLE THEY DO NINETEEN THOUSAND

00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:31.702
HEARINGS A YEAR.

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:32.636
AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:35.773
ORIGINALLY SPENT A DECADE --

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.807
DEVELOPING THS IN IMPLEMENTING

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:37.641
IT.

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:40.511
AND SO -- IT WE ARE WE'VE BEEN

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:42.146
WORKING A LOT WITH CARLETON

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:44.248
UNIVERSITY WHICH IS THE

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:46.150
UNIVERSITY IN OTTAWA CANADA THAT --

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.685
DEVELOPED IT FOR THE PROBATIVE

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:50.254
CANADA AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:51.422
REALLY BEEN PUTTING OUR EFFORT

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:53.290
IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS IN

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:56.026
CANADA BECAUSE IT'S MORE NOW

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:58.262
AGAINST ANY OTHER STATES TO US.

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:02.366
YOU MENTION A STATE AND I HAD-CANCERS OHIO AN ETIQUETTE.

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:06.003
SOUTH DAKOTA WASHINGTON KENTUCKY

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.037
IN UTAH.

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:08.773
AND THEY USE THEM FOR BOTH SHORT

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:10.841
TERM AND LONG TERM OFFENDERS

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:12.309
SOME OF THEM JUST SHORT TERM

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:13.244
OFFENDERS SO.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.278
VERY VERY DIFFERENT

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:15.346
JURISDICTIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS

00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:17.848
OF APPLYING IT.

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:22.253
GREAT -- LA -- WANTED -- TO BY

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:25.289
NOW AND WHAT WE WANT.

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:25.790
TO HEALING O'NEILL WITH

00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:27.958
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S.

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:28.526
I'LL GIVE ARE COMMON ON THE

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.394
STRUCTURE.

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:33.397
I'M MORE AND THEN [inaudible]

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:34.765
YOU.

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:36.033
DID YOU NOT HAVE ANY COMMENT ON

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.636
THE DECISIONS AND THERE ARE.

00:40:38.702 --> 00:40:40.371
BERMAN INNER LIMITED TERM.

00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:43.340
WHEN WE REVIEWED THAT BUDGET

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:44.809
REQUEST WE THINK THAT EVER?

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:48.512
YOUR REASONABLE -- HOWEVER HAS

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:49.880
ALSO INDICATED IN MY YOU MAKING

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.782
FRAMEWORK.

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:54.051
THE REQUESTED RECORD U. S. M. AT

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:56.320
THE REMARK IS IMPLEMENTED ON

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:57.788
TIME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:58.856
BUDGET YEAR AND IT HAS THE

00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:01.292
ANTICIPATED UP BACK ON THE

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:03.360
LENGTH HEARINGS -- IF IT DOESN'T

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:04.762
HAVE THAT EFFECT.

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:06.197
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ARE MEANT

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:07.698
WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.567
IN OTHER WORDS AT EASE REQUESTED

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:12.369
RESOURCES AS SOON.

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:12.903
AS WELL IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.505
FRAMEWORK [inaudible]

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:16.574
AND SO.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.075
M..

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:19.643
WE DO THINK THAT THE FRAMEWORK

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.812
AS IN KERR'S PROMISING GIVEN IT

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:22.313
IS THE BEST.

00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:22.813
YES.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.082
I'M NOT ABLE TO REVIEW THE FRAME

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:26.951
WE HAVE NO WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:27.585
IN THE FRAMEWORK.

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:30.287
OF THE RIVER REVIEW LITERATURE

00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:32.389
ON THE FRAME WORK ON IT I

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:33.657
FRAMEWORK.

00:41:33.724 --> 00:41:36.260
I'M AND TO WE THINK IN GENERAL

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:36.927
MEANS LIKE A PROMISING APPROACH.

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:42.066
I'M BUT IT THE PROPOSAL LACK --

00:41:42.132 --> 00:41:43.100
AND WE HAVE BE OUTLINED.

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:45.836
INFORMATION THAT WE THINK -- IT

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:46.637
LACKED IN YOUR IN THE REPORT

00:41:46.704 --> 00:41:47.171
WHICH IS REFLECTED IN YOUR

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:49.273
AGENDA BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.708
AND THE KEY INFORMATION.

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.543
I IS THAT IS IT WOULD BE

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.379
REQUIRED -- EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:58.249
PROPOSAL IS A PROCESS FOR

00:41:58.315 --> 00:41:59.683
DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:01.919
THE TIMELINE HOW WILL BE USED

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:03.721
HOW OLD WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:05.122
HOW WILL BE EVALUATED.

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.523
WE THINK THAT THAT INFORMATION

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.858
IS IMPORTANT THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:09.627
HAVE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:12.529
EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT OF MENTALLY

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:15.199
THING IF THEY CAN'T CHANGE IN

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:15.599
HOW WE MAKE ROTH.

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:18.669
AND AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:20.738
THE FUNDING REQUEST [inaudible]

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:21.205
EMPLOYMENT [inaudible]

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:22.873
MARK.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.575
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY IT'S

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:25.209
IMPORTANT TO LET.

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:27.044
HAVE THAT INFORMATION.

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:27.811
WE WILL HOLD RECOMMENDATION ON

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.213

I'M TO THE EXTENT THE DEPARTMENT

IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT AND

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:39.023
THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO MOVE

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:40.157
FORWARD REGARDLESS.

WE THINK THAT THE NEW PAGE

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:00.711
BERKSHIRE A NEW KEEP A STRUCTURE

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:03.914

I'M.

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:22.366
THE STRUCTURE OF THE NEW AB

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.734
EIGHT ABLE A SCHEDULE WAS NOT

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.402
PROVIDED WITH THE IMPORTANT

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:27.004
GIVEN THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:29.106
CURRENT ONE HAS SOME --

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:31.208
POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE.

00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:33.143
THAT WE WANT TO AVOID RECREATING.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:37.014
I'M AND THERE WAS ALSO NOT M. HE

TOLD INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:39.183
CHANGES.

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:42.653
BORDERS AT ANTICIPATING MAKING

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.287
TO ATTORNEY RECRUITMENT TRAINING

00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:45.756

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:48.659

I'M IF IT IS UNABLE -- I'M IN

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:53.597
THE NEAR TERM AND ALSO IN LIGHT

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:56.734
OF ENDING IT -- ASIAN LET.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:02.973
BUT BY.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.608
ONE AND IN OUR DEPARTMENT REPORT

BACK ON THE BEAT.

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:09.480
OUT THERE.

00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:12.249
IN TIME FOR NEXT.

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:14.785
STONE THAT YOU MADE THE POINT --

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:18.389
ON THE ATTORNEY A BUT IN I AGREE

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:19.957
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE WITH THE

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:23.360
STRUCTURE WOULD BE.

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:24.395
WORSE YOU HAVE THAT PAYMENT.

00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:25.062
OR THAT.

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:26.964
CURRENT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:28.165
YOU.

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:29.400
WHAT'S THE NUMBER OF HOURS

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.735
ATTORNEYS ON AVERAGE WOULD SPEND.

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:34.538
WOULD WE EXPECT.

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:36.607
I MEAN THIS IS BUT YOUR FOUR

00:44:36.673 --> 00:44:37.207
HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST HAS THIS

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:40.744
LIKE. TWENTY FIVE BUCKS.

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:43.213
FOR IS THE GREEN TO DO IT AND

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.015
SEVENTY FIVE CORRECT.

00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:46.617
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT ECONOMY

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:49.453
SCALE THAT GOES ON WE WHEN WE

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.488
ASSIGN SOMEBODY WHEN WE APPOINT

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:52.556
COUNSEL.

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.358
WE ACCOUNT APPOINT THEM TO

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:56.193
REPRESENT EVERY INMATE WHO'S ON

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.996
CALENDAR AT THAT OFFENSE AT THAT

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:00.431
INSTITUTION FOR THE WEEK.

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:03.033
AND SO WHEN YOU GET FOUR HUNDRED

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.968
DOLLARS -- AN INMATE THAT YOU'RE

00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:07.237
REPRESENTING SOME MAY WAIVE

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:09.940
THEIR HEARINGS EARLY ON SAME MAY

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:12.943
END UP -- YES BUT THEY DON'T GET

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.777
FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT ON

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:16.113
YOUR NO NO NO YOU ONLY GET.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.915
A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE OF IT

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:20.584
IF YOU AROUND YOUR ROLE HEARING

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:21.218
YOU ONLY GET A HUNDRED OF IT IF

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:22.519
YOU [inaudible]

00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:23.087
SO.

00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:26.190
WE IWILL SAY THAT EVEN GIVEN

00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:27.124
OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE.

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:30.527
I'M WE HAVE NOT HAD -- WE HAVE

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:31.795
WAITING LISTS FOR PEOPLE WANT TO

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.097
DO THIS WORK.

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:34.465
HOWEVER WERE MORE CONCERNED

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:36.500
ABOUT THE QUALITY.

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:39.036
AND THE EXPECTATIONS AVERAGE

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:39.937
HOURLY RATE.

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:43.540
ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA IS.

00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:44.741
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR.

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:46.877
CURRENT RATE WE'RE IN FOUR

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.112
HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH I CAN'T

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:53.617
IMAGINE WE ONLY IN OUR OUR WORK.

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:55.919
BUT THEY DO -- WE HAVE IT SET UP

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.121
SO THAT WHEN THEY GO OUT TO THE

00:45:57.187 --> 00:45:59.156
INSTITUTION THEYCAN INTERVIEW

00:45:59.223 --> 00:45:59.957
ALL OF THEIR INMATES AT THE SAME

00:46:00.023 --> 00:46:02.159
TIME YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.627
OR YOU KNOW OVER A SERIES OF OF

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:05.262
OURS.

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.762
SO THERE THERE ARE SOME

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.064
ECONOMIES IS.

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.632
I I HESITATE BECAUSE AGAIN I'M

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.467
NOT.

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:11.835
IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR HOW MUCH I

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:12.870
CAN TALK ABOUT WITH THE

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:14.371
SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS IN THE

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:15.906
CURRENT LITIGATION.

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:17.841
BUT I CAN TELL YOU SOME OF THE

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:18.909
THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:20.310
BEFORE WE ENTERED SETTLEMENT

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:21.678
NEGOTIATIONS ARE.

00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:23.747
GOING TERMS OF SKIN PRODUCT THAT

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:25.516
LAWSUIT WOULD WE BE IN A

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:27.618
SITUATION WHERE THE ULTIMATE

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:30.320
SETTLEMENT REQUIRES A CERTAIN

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:32.022
PAYMENT THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:33.123
THAN WERE ANTICIPATING

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.423
[inaudible]

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.192
YES.

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:39.329
WHICH IS THAT.

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:40.597
NO THEY'RE NOT ONLY. ONE OF THE

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:41.465
OTHER THINGS WELL AND I'M NOT

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:43.100
SURE THAT IT WILL BE RECTIFIED

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:44.168
BEFORE THE END OF THE BUDGET

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:46.236
YEAR OR SO WE'RE WORKING AS FAST

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:48.405
AS WE CAN BUT I'M WILL%

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:49.940
DEFINITELY BE IN A MUCH WORSE

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:50.941
PLACE.

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:53.410
LITIGATION WEISS IF WE IF WE

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:54.978
DON'T INCREASE IT TO AT LEAST

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:56.346
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW OR WHAT

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:58.182
WE'RE REQUESTING.

00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:59.583
SO IT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.718
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS NOT

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:01.985
APPROVED.

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:03.820
IN THE LITIGATION ONE OF THE

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:04.721
THINGS THAT WE CONTEMPLATED

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:06.623
WHICH OF PERHAPS WILL BE SOUND A

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.825
LITTLE BIT MORE -- VISIBLE IF

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:11.862
YOU WILL FOR HIRING ATTORNEYS.

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:14.665
IS THAT -- ONE OF THE CONCEPTS

00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:16.633
HAS BEEN PUT OUT THERE IS THAT.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.302
YOU ASSIGN SOMEBODY THERE A

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:20.204
LEVIN CASES FOR THE WEEK OR TEN

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.505
CASES FOR THE WEEK.

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:22.873
AND YOU BASICALLY TREAT IT LIKE

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.675
A SALARY.

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:25.909
YOU GET SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:27.177
FOR EACH OF THESE UNDER STATE

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:28.512
BAR RULES YOU HAVE A LOT OF

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:30.581
OBLIGATIONS IT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:47:30.647 --> 00:47:31.415
DOLLAR NO OVERSEEING GOING

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:33.283
FORWARD IF WE DID THE SEVEN

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:34.384
HUNDRED DOLLARS WE COULD

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:36.053
STRUCTURE IT IN A WAY.

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:38.555
WHERE YOU GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:39.790
THIS IS JUST HOW WE CURRENTLY DO

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:41.325
IT WE'RE LOOKING AT REVAMPING

00:47:41.391 --> 00:47:42.492
THE WHOLE THING?

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:44.595
SO THE IDEA WOULD BE INCREASED

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:47.297
TRAINING INCREASE FEES BUT ALSO

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.031
A DIFFERENT KIND OF FEE

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:49.766
STRUCTURE SO I WAS JUST

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:50.434
EXPLAINING WHERE THE THINGS IT'S

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.437
BEEN -- EXPLORED AS A POTENTIAL

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:57.040
OPTION IS ACTUALLY GIVE THE THE

00:47:57.107 --> 00:47:59.343
FULL AMOUNT FOR ACCEPTING THAT

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:00.777
REPRESENTATION.

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:02.012
AND THEN SOME OF THEIR CLIENTS

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:03.113
AREN'T GOING TO NEED THAT MONEY

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.548
THAT MANY HOURS AND THEN THEY

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:06.717
COULD USE THAT TIME FOR THE

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:08.085
OTHER CLIENTS TO DO RESEARCH.

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:10.120
YOU NEED MORE HOURS SO THERE

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:11.421
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:13.257
IT THAT WAY WE DON'T INCENTIVIZE

00:48:13.323 --> 00:48:14.625
BEHAVIOR.

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.627
I'M OTHER THAN PERHAPS WAVING

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:18.362
MAYBE EARLY ON TO AVOID WORK BUT

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:20.097
THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S A BAR

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:22.532
ISSUE AND WE WOULD BE WORKING

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.735
WITH AN OUTSIDE ENTITY

00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:25.035
[inaudible]

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:26.803
FORCED OUT.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.171
WE HAVE A PROPOSAL THATWE HAVE

00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:30.741
SUBMITTED AS PART OF THE

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:32.342
SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS.

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:33.744
AND SO WE'RE STILL DISCUSSING IT

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.646
WITH THEM AS WHAT IT WOULD LOOK

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:37.748
LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:39.750
ADOPT THEM.

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.318
OR THE TOTAL MEANT THAT'LL AND

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:42.286
WHATEVER WE ADOPT WE STILL DON'T

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:43.787
HAVE.

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:45.155
WE HAVE A DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR YOU

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:48.091
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A KEY.

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:49.159
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:50.494
NAVIGATE ALL OF THAT TO BE

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.297
HONEST I'M NOT SURE WHY I DON'T.

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:55.365
I'M NOT SURE WHAT ALL I COULD IN

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:56.533
GOOD FAITH.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.934
DISCUSS WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:00.904
INCOME ARRIVE IT WANT TO ACT.

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:01.738
BY JUNE FIFTEENTH WHAT WE

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:03.407

ROLE PROCESS YOU KNOW WE HONOR

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:08.131
WE TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER A BUT

THEY'RE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:11.902
THOUSAND LIVES.

00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:14.070
MY FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER.

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:16.973
AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS MORE WHO

ARE NOT SERVING LIFE SENTENCES

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:20.110
BUT AS OF SOME OF THE THE RECENT

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:20.944
CHANGES.

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:23.013
SHAPER MENTIONED ARE NOW SUBJECT

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:24.748

BUT OUR IN OUR WORK WE'VE WE'VE

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:44.734
HAD [inaudible] TWO HUNDRED TWO

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:46.303
HUNDRED FIFTEEN WE WE DO ENJOY A

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:47.571
VERY LOW RECIDIVISM RATE FOR

00:51:47.637 --> 00:51:51.741
UNDER.

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:52.676
ONE BUT WHAT WE REALLY FOUND

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:54.544
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT.

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:56.880
IT'S BECOME CLEAR IN IN THE LAST

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:57.481
COUPLE OF YEARS OF DOING THIS

00:51:57.547 --> 00:51:59.249
WORK.

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:00.684
IS THAT WHERE WE HAVE THE

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.686
GREATEST SUCCESS.

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.721
WITH OUR CLIENTS.

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:05.322
THE WORK WE'RE DOING IS REALLY

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:07.958
UP.

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:09.326
OFTEN IS HELPING THEM DEAL WITH.

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:11.394
THEIR OWN RESPONSES TO CHILDHOOD

00:52:11.461 --> 00:52:13.196
TRAUMA.

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:15.131
AND HOW THAT TRANSLATED AND

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:17.567
THEIR ACTIONS ASSOCIATION --

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:18.568
THAT HARM TO OTHERS AND LANDED

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:19.336
THEM IN PRISON [inaudible]

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:22.906
AND THAT'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:25.108
A LONG TIME REALLY EVEN TO

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:26.076
ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WE NEED

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:28.512
TO WITH OUR CLIENTS. TO DO THAT

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:30.180
WORK FOR THEM.

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:33.283
TO DISCLOSE THIS THIS BELIEVE.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.385
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WE HAVE

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:36.786
THE GREATEST SUCCESS?

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:38.555
IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND IN

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:39.189
THOSE INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS IN

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:42.192
WHICH IN ADDITION TO OUR MEETING

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:43.426
WITH THEM.

00:52:43.493 --> 00:52:45.028
THEY ALSO HAVE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:46.229
THE INSTITUTION THEY CAN GO THE

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:47.464
MAN.

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:49.232
THAT MEANS THEY'RE INVOLVED IN.

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.267
OTHER PROGRAMS IN THE

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:51.735
INSTITUTION THAT ARE BUILT ON

00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:53.503
SOME TYPE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:56.573
OR SHARED SAFETY CHAIRED HEALING

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.042
MODEL -- WHERE THEY CAN PROCESS

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:01.311
THE STUFF IN ADDITION TO THE TWO

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:02.746
HOURS WE SPENT TOGETHER?

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:04.347
COUPLE WEEKS MONTHS.

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:06.349
AND WHERE THOSE THINGS COME

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:08.485
TOGETHER PEOPLE HAVE GREAT --

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.287
THOSE TEND TO BE LOWER SECURITY

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:11.454
LEVEL PRISONS FOR A LOT OF

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:14.190
REASONS WE COULD TALK ABOUT --

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:14.958
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY BUT

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.626
IT WILL WORK OUT THAT WAY.

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:18.194
BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT AS THE

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:19.963
MAJOR THING AND AND AND ALSO

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.164
SEEMS THAT.

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:24.000
OVER THE YEARS THE WAY THE ROLE

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:26.469
MISSIONERS APPROACH HEARINGS.

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:27.871
THAT WORK MATTERS MORE THAN IT

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:30.307
USED.

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:31.608
TO IT USED TO BE.

00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:33.043
WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT

00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:35.245
ABOUT LITIGATION USED TO BE THAT

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:36.646
ROLE FOR FOCUS ON THE PERSON

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:37.914
PRIME.

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.015
LANDED IN PRISON.

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:40.951
AND IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER HOW

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:42.218
MUCH THEY CHANGE THEIR LIVES

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:44.020
WHILE THEY'RE THE BOARD WOULD.

00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:46.957
BE.

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:48.992
INCLINED TO DENY PAROLE BASEBALL.

00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:51.127
AND THAT PROCESS HAS IMPROVED SO

00:53:51.194 --> 00:53:52.862
THAT THE BOARD IS MORE

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:53.496
INTERESTED IN HOW MUCH THE FIRST

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:54.931
CHANGE.

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:58.969
WHO THEY ARE TODAY?

00:53:59.035 --> 00:53:59.603
THE SHAPERS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:00.971
HELPING. TO ENCOURAGE THE

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:01.605
COMMISSIONERS TO MOVE IN THAT

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:03.006
DIRECTION AD AND CONTINUE TO

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:04.007
PROVIDE TRAINING TO HELP THEM

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:07.377
MOVE THERE AND AND AND THAT HAS

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:09.980
HAS DEALT BUT A BIT -- THAT IS

00:54:10.046 --> 00:54:11.047
HELP BRING THE ROLE GRANT RIGHT

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:12.515
WHERE IT IS.

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:15.852
YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT.

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:19.155
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE SCHEDULED

00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:21.491
HEARINGS THE YOUR RESULT ROLL?

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:24.427
AND IT WAS A VERY.

00:54:24.494 --> 00:54:26.262
YOUR WAY ASPECT.

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:30.867
THE ANSWER BETWEEN 1822%.

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.102
OF THE SCHEDULED HEARINGS ADULT

00:54:32.168 --> 00:54:33.670
IN THE ROOM.

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:36.673
THAT MEANS THAT 78% OF THE ROLE

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.642
ELIGIBLE PEOPLE ARE NOT.

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:41.378
RELEASED EACH YEAR.

00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:42.646
THERE A LOT OF WAYS TO LOOK AT

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:44.748
WHY THAT IS.

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:45.382
BUT WE REALLY NEED A BREAK DOWN

00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:46.449
THE WHY THAT.

00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:48.218
BUT IT KNOWLEDGE YES THAT MEANS

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:50.120
WEIRD IF IF.

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:52.656
IF THE EXPECTATION.

00:54:52.722 --> 00:54:54.691
IN THE LAWS.

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:56.860
IS THAT PEOPLE WILL NORMALLY BE

00:54:56.926 --> 00:54:57.560
BRANDED ROLE WHEN THEY WERE

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:59.162
BROUGHT.

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:02.599
UNLESS PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:04.134
IN THE NATION THEY CANNOT BE

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:04.801
REALLY.

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:07.837
THEY SHOULD NOT BE WITH.

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.272
PUBLIC SAFETY EXCEPT IT HAS COME.

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:10.440
TO A SMALL THE RULE I THINK IN

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:14.177
PRACTICE -- BUT WE DO SEE.

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:17.047
ABOUT 20% OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE.

00:55:17.113 --> 00:55:18.515
ELIGIBLE ARE BEING GRANT.

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:24.988
WE'VE SEEN OF A FEW OF THE THE

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:26.690
CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO THE

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:29.059
OVERCROWDING.

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:31.594
INTENDED TO IDENTIFY.

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:32.395
GROUPS WITHIN THE POPULATION

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:37.167
THAT COULD SAFELY BE RELEASED --

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:39.402
REVIEWING CASES OF PEOPLE WHO

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:41.404
ARE CONVICTED OF FOUR SERVINGS

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:45.241
CONTRACTS AT FOR NONVIOLENT.

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:45.809
THAT WAS ONE OF THE MEASURES

00:55:45.875 --> 00:55:49.145
THAT.

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:51.047
SO THE IDEA WAS THE HERE'S SOME

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:52.315
PEOPLE HO ARE NOT THERE FOR

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:53.783
VIOLENT CRIMES.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.285
WE REVIEW THEM ON THE ROLE

00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:57.687
CONSIDERATION PROCESS.

00:55:57.754 --> 00:55:58.988
THIS HELPS US ROUTE REDUCE

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:01.224
OVERALL POPULATION.

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:05.395
WELL THERE PROGRAM RATES AROUND.

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.530
WE ALSO WE ADDED.

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:08.898
THE ELDERLY PAROLE CONSIDERATION

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:10.633
RECOGNIZING PEOPLE WHO ARE SIXTY

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.202
YEARS OLD OR OLDER.

00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:13.403
SERVE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.772
IN PRISON.

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:17.674
ALL THE THE SIGNS ALL THE

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:19.542
LITERATURE INDICATES THERE MUCH

00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:21.644
LOWER RISK RESERVE A ESPECIALLY

00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:24.981
VIOLENTLY THAN THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:27.016
THERE PROGRAM RATES ARE STILL

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:28.485
TWENTY SOME PERCENT [inaudible]

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:30.720
YEAH NUMBER.

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:32.589
THE OTHER PIECE THAT COMES UP I

00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:33.523
WAS IN THIS BUDGET TEAM ALSO

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.596
WHERE WE NEED TO FIND OTHER WAYS.

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:16.366

I'M AT WORK.

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:49.058

OF WHAT WE DO. TO THE WHEN WE

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:52.729
GET TO THE PAROLE HEARING

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:53.763
THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THE WORK

THEMSELVES OUT.

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:56.866
IT'S NOT ABOUT.

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:58.434
WHEN I SAY IN THE HEARING VISION

00:58:58.501 --> 00:58:59.369
AS A NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:01.004
WHAT I HAVE?

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:01.604

BUT IF.

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:09.112
IF THE ATTORNEY IS NOT IN A

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:13.683
POSITION. TO PROVIDE THAT KIND

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:14.684

ENOUGH IN THE PROCESS.

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:17.553
THEN I DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE A

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.055
MAJOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.790
WILL PROCESS A LOT MORE CASE.

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.258
BUT I DON'T SEE I DON'T EXPECT A

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:24.527
MAJOR INCREASE IN THE PROGRAM

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:25.295

GET THROUGH THE PROCESS SO.

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:39.943
THAT'S THAT'S MY INTEREST BUT I

DO.

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:12.175

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.364
AND THE BRANCH WITH MAYBE A

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.333
HUNDRED MORE PAGES.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.769
AND SO I THINK IT'S IF THERE

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:01.370
WERE SOME.

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.339

[inaudible] TO ITALY TRANSLATE

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.978
THOSE WITH SORT OF AN EASY FIX

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.214
TO HELP PEOPLE BETTER.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.281
THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING ANOTHER

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.717
RELATED THING IS ABOUT.

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:17.620
BETTER ASSISTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:18.621
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.456
AND MENTAL ILLNESS.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.626
I THINK IF THAT COULD BE HAVING.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.595
SPECIALLY TRAINED ERNIE'S SIGN

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:28.064
OF THOSE DAYS.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:31.400
IMPROPER ORDER.

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:34.237
I DIDN'T COMPLICATED. TO MAKE

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.905

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:36.439
BOTH IN PREPARING FOR THE

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:36.973

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:47.083
[inaudible]

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:47.750
ROUTE.

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.518
AND THEN THE THE LAST THING

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:52.521
ACTUAL RELATES TO THE WE TALKED

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:53.055
ABOUT WITH THE ROLE OF THE

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:54.457
ATTORNEYS IN THE BECAUSE I'LL

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:57.360
I'LL I ALWAYS SAY THAT I'M I'M

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.262
MORE BUT I'M STILL.

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:01.931
LAWYER. TO WORK IT OUT.

01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:03.933

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:09.538
OF COUNSELING THEIR BACKGROUND

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:12.541

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.444
THE SPORT.

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:18.814
AND WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT.

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.650
RATHER THAN EXPECTING LAWYERS

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.485
COMPARE.

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:25.021
OR EXPECTING THEM TO SPEND WEEKS

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:27.390

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.660
THAT THERE BE SOME EFFORT ON THE

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:33.429
PART OF THE STATE.

FOR RELEASE ON PAROLE.

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:49.378
AND AND I'M REALLY FOCUSING ON

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.247
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT.

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:53.215
EARLY DIAGNOSE WITH THE AXIS ONE

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:56.018
DIAGNOSIS THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:58.521
BE UNKNOWN A SLOW.

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:00.156
FROM PROCESS SYSTEM.

ROLE.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:13.936
SO THOSE ARE COUPLE

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:16.539
RECOMMENDATIONS I HAVE.

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:18.541
BEEN WORK IN THIS AREA FOR QUITE

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:23.312
AWHILE IN A HUNDRED TO HEARING.

WHEN I CAN PLANE WHAT IS A

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:39.955
LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:42.558
CATEGORY OF INMATE THAT WE

REENTRY FACILITIES MY MY

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.331
FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF

IF IT NEEDS IF THERE'S SOMETHING

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:46.822
AN ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:48.691
ONCE IT BECOMES FINAL THEN THE

01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:50.926
GOVERNOR HAS THIRTY DAYS TO ACT

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.495

THEM BACK TO STATE PRISON

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.515
BECAUSE THE DECISION IS NOT

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:14.450
GOING TO BE FINAL.

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.418
OUR IS NOT GOING TO BE UPHELD SO

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:19.054
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:20.556
POPULATION IF YOU WILL SO WHEN

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:22.258
WE LOOK AT FOLKS FOR PURPOSES OF

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:23.492
PAROLE.

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:26.262
I'M AND THEIR PRO PLANS WE'RE

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.430
NOT CONTEMPLATING A TRADITIONAL

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.432
RE ENTRY FACILITY LIKE THAT

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:32.701
INSTEAD THE DIVISION OF ADULT --

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:35.404
PRO OPERATIONS AND DIVISION OF

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.739
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THEY

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.040
HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:39.208
TRANSITIONAL BEDS IN THE

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.209
COMMUNITY.

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:41.810
AND SO THESE FOLKS WE'VE NEVER

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.445
HAD ANYBODY TURN DOWN FOR

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:44.980
TRANSITIONAL BAD SO WHAT WE WILL

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:46.549
DO IS ORDER AS A SPECIAL

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:47.883
CONDITION OF PAROLE THAT THEY GO

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:49.718

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:50.386
MONTHS.

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:51.921
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:53.455
INSTITUTION FOR SO LONG AND THAT

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:55.591
TRANSITION FROM THAT VERY

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:57.993
STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.062
TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE CAN BE

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:01.797
VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM AND

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.699
SO MOST OF THEM THAT I GO OUT

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:05.134
AND TALK TO ARE VERY THANKFUL

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.802
AFTER A WHILE THAT THEY'VE GONE

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.903
TO IT.

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.038
INITIALLY THERE NOT SO HAPPY

01:10:09.104 --> 01:10:10.339

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.381
TWO MONTHS THAT THEY WERE

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:20.749
THEY'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:22.718
HAD THE STEPPING STONE BECAUSE

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:24.887
THEY DID NOT ANTICIPATE.

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:26.455
HOW OVERWHELMING IT WOULD BE?

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:28.290
THAT'S STARTING TO GET BETTER

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.558
CONVEYED TO THE INMATES --

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:30.559

THAT WE DEAL WITH IT'S VERY

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.502
DIFFERENT FROM THESE KIND OF

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:43.572

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:17.792
HOME.

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:20.729
THEN THEY PREP EVERY NIGHT AND

01:23:20.795 --> 01:23:22.364
EVERY WEEKEND.

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.733
IT IS A FULL TIME JOB.

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:39.214
MORE THAN OF SO WHAT HAPPENS IS --

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.348
FOR MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF A

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:41.750
PAROLE HEARING WE ASSIGNED

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:43.785

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:44.953
THEIR COUNSEL.

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.254
SO THERE'S A SERIES OF

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:48.089
INTERACTIONS.

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:49.791
NOW THEY CAN IF THEY HAVE

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.259
PRIVATE FUNDS THEY CAN HAVE A

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:52.727
PRIVATE ATTORNEY BUT THE MOST

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:53.728
PART.

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:54.729
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY.

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:59.834
OF YES THREE WE END UP HIRING

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.503
FOLKS IS SIMILAR.

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:02.170
SO.

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:04.038
BACK MAY DROP OUT AT SOME POINT

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:06.608
DURING THAT FOUR MONTHS THEY MAY

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:09.644
REQUEST A POSTPONEMENT THEY MAY --

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:12.447
REQUEST A WAIVER.

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:13.815
OR THEY MAY SAY WE WANT TO

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.618
STIPULATE. TO BEING UNSUITABLE.

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:19.387
AND SO THEY MAY NOT GET ALL THE

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:21.322
WAY TO THE END IN EACH OF THOSE

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:22.891
CASES SO THAT'S HOW THE FEE

01:24:22.957 --> 01:24:24.325
STRUCTURE WAS ORIGINALLY.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:32.300
BUT TOGETHER MANY YEARS AGO.

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:32.767
EIGHT NINE YOUR LOOK.

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:36.638
THAT.

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:38.473
SO ALL THESE [inaudible]

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:42.677
BROUGHT.

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:45.346
IRAQ I'M THERE AT WILL --

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:46.648
THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY NINE OF

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:47.248
THEM STATEWIDE I BELIEVE RIGHT

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:49.784
NOW THEY SERVE ON PANELS WHICH

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:52.287
MEANS -- A THEY HAVE DESIGNATED

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:54.389
INSTITUTIONS ARE WHERE THEY SAY

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:57.091
I WANT TO REPRESENT PEOPLE IN ON

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:58.159
ONE OF THESE PANELS.

01:24:58.226 --> 01:24:59.494
IN THOSE LOCATIONS [inaudible]

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:01.029
IN [inaudible]

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:12.540
WE ARE [inaudible] EIGHT LAST.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:14.008
IT'S BEEN ABOUT TEN YEARS.

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:15.910
AT TEN YEARS [inaudible]

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:18.446
WHY IT?

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:21.749
A LOT OF REASONS -- ONE IS THAT

01:25:21.816 --> 01:25:23.384
AGAIN WE HAVE NOT HAD A

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:24.819
RECRUITMENT PROBLEM AND WE HAVE

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:26.321
FOUND THAT BOOKS HAVE BEEN A

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:27.322
LITTLE.

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:30.525
RELUCTANT TO INCREASE THAT IS IF

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:32.794
WE HAVE WAITING LISTS OF PEOPLE

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:33.361
THAT WANT TO SERVE ON THESE

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:33.962
PANELS.

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:36.030
AND THEN WHAT WE'VE DECIDED IS

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:39.400
THAT -- IF WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW.

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:41.135
IS THAT WE WANT TO INCREASE THE

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:42.937
EXPECTATIONS SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:44.539
INCREASE THE EXPECTATIONS YOU

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:45.740
WILL MEET WITH YOUR CLIENT X.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.408
NUMBER OF TIMES FOR X. AMOUNT OF

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:48.276
TIME.

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:51.846
YOU WILL -- REVIEW THE RISK

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:54.115
ASSESSMENT WITH THEM IN DETAIL

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:56.584
YOU WILL I'M HELP DEVELOP ROLE

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.219
PLANS THINGS LIKE THAT IF WE

01:25:58.286 --> 01:25:59.087
WANT TO BUILD IN THOSE

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:00.255
EXPECTATIONS.

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:03.324
IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO ASK THEM

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:06.694
TO DO THAT BASED ON THE SAME DAY --

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:07.662
ALMOST DOUBLE [inaudible]

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.564
SEVEN YES.

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:11.599
WE DID THAT SO WE DID THE STUDY

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.134
OF WHAT OF WHAT THE OTHER

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:14.736
COUNTIES AND THE FEDERAL

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:15.770
GOVERNMENT ARE DOING.

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:17.639
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:19.741
WOULD MAKE SENSE AND SO WE

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:20.942
ACTUALLY DID A LITTLE BIT OF

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:22.810
ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE BREAKDOWN

01:26:22.877 --> 01:26:24.512
IS ALSO FOR APPELLATE.

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:26.781
COUNSEL OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:27.348
PROJECT.

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:29.384
AND THE BREAKDOWN OF DOLLARS FOR

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:30.885
EACH LINES OF THINGS AND HOW

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:33.421
MANY HOURS THEY CAN MAX OUT AT

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:35.590
FOR EACH OF THOSE THINGS AND IT.

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:37.091
IT WAS THE ONE THAT MADE MOST

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:39.327
SENSE IT SEEMED TO KIND OF

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:41.162
ACTUALLY DID IT IN TWO DIFFERENT

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:43.064
WAYS WHERE WE THE CALIFORNIA

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.566
APPELLATE PROJECT.

01:26:44.632 --> 01:26:46.401
THE SCHEDULE AND SAT DOWN AND

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:47.035
SAID OKAY IF YOU'RE DOING A PRO

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:48.670
HEARING.

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:50.271
WHAT'S ANALOGOUS IN HIM UP WITH

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:52.140
A NUMBER THE MEANTIME OTHER

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:54.008
STAFF ACTUALLY IT THE WHOLE

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:56.110
SURVEY WITH THE OTHER COUNTIES

01:26:56.177 --> 01:26:58.046
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:26:58.112 --> 01:26:59.080
WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE SAME

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:03.451
NUMBER HE SAID I MUST BE HAD?

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:04.419
SO WE'RE OPEN FOR YOU KNOW

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:05.053
ADDITIONAL IF SOMEBODY HAS OTHER

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:06.921
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WE THOUGHT

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:08.423
THAT THAT WAS THE MOST ANALOGOUS

01:27:08.489 --> 01:27:09.223
TO US.

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:10.892
AND IT'S SOME FRAMEWORK THIS IS

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:13.328
A VERY UNIQUE AREA OF THE LAW WE

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:14.762
DON'T WE COULDN'T FIND TOO MANY

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:17.065

IN WHAT THEY DO AND UP BY US SO.

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:26.608
THAT WAS THE BEST WE COULD COME

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:27.809
UP WITH IF SOMEBODY HAS OTHER

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:31.512

THESE WERE INCREASED A BIT AND

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:24.399
IT WAS MORE FINANCIALLY --

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:25.366

IF NOT REPLACE THESE DOESN'T

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:15.668

REALLY AND LOOK AT OUR

02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:12.091
UTILIZATION DATA.

02:02:12.158 --> 02:02:13.292
THEY WOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:14.727
THE DATA MANAGEMENT WITH IN THE

02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:15.861
INSTITUTIONS TALK ABOUT

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:17.363
REDIRECTION SOMETHING THAT WE

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:18.464
DID LAST YEAR WITH THE HELP --

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:21.834
ASSET -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT?

02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:23.803
HE AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT AN

02:02:23.869 --> 02:02:26.272
OUNCE MEANT TO OUR SYSTEM OF

02:02:26.338 --> 02:02:27.640
RECORD AND A SAFETY.

02:02:27.707 --> 02:02:28.808
I'M PUTTING AN ADDITIONAL BILLS

02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:33.345
TO IDENTIFY.

02:02:33.412 --> 02:02:35.848
THE WORK AS FAR AS REMOVAL OF

02:02:35.915 --> 02:02:38.017
THE ASSET FROM OUR SYSTEM THE

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:39.485
REGISTRATION OF THE SYSTEM.

02:02:39.552 --> 02:02:42.588
SURVEYING OUT THE OLD ASSETS AND

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:45.491
WE AND THAT IN PART.

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:46.058

THANK YOU MA'AM.

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:57.336
WE THINK THAT A MORE FREQUENT

02:02:57.403 --> 02:02:58.337
REPLACEMENT OF VEHICLES AT THE

02:02:58.404 --> 02:03:00.740
ART OF BEST AN OVERALL STRATEGY

02:03:00.806 --> 02:03:03.175
MINIMIZE THE COST OF OWNERSHIP.

02:03:03.242 --> 02:03:05.044
DOES SEEM REASONABLE AND BY THAT

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:07.012
I MEAN A STRATEGY WHERE VEHICLES

02:03:07.079 --> 02:03:09.014
ARE SOLD AT THE POINT WHEN THE

02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:11.150
WHEN THEY'RE INCREASE THEIR

02:03:11.217 --> 02:03:14.386
ANNUAL CARE AND FUEL COSTS ARE.

02:03:14.453 --> 02:03:16.455
TO EAT AT THEIR ANNUAL.

02:03:16.522 --> 02:03:18.023
ASIAN.

02:03:18.090 --> 02:03:18.758
AND THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH BEST

02:03:18.824 --> 02:03:19.525
PRACTICES IN FLEET MANAGEMENT AS

02:03:19.592 --> 02:03:21.360
WELL AS THE DIRECTION THAT DEGAS

02:03:21.427 --> 02:03:22.027
HAD DIRECTED.

02:03:22.094 --> 02:03:23.562
DEPARTMENT.

02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:24.663
EIGHT I'M AND I UNDERSTAND TO BE

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:27.066
THE OVER ARCHING PROMISED BEHIND

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:27.366
THIS.

02:03:27.433 --> 02:03:30.836
PROPOSAL -- BUT WE DO HAVE TWO

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:31.504
CONCERNS WITH.

02:03:31.570 --> 02:03:32.505
THE SPECIFIC TO THE PROPOSAL THE

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:34.774
FIRST IS THAT AS I MENTIONED

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.542
IT'S ABSURD PREMISE ON THE

02:03:36.609 --> 02:03:38.611
NOTION OF A NUMBER.

02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:39.779
OF BATON.

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:41.380
ACHIEVING SAVINGS IN VEHICLE

02:03:41.447 --> 02:03:42.948
YOU'LL MAINTENANCE REPAIR AND

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:45.251
RESELL -- BUT THE PROPOSAL DOES

02:03:45.317 --> 02:03:46.786
NOT FOR THOSE SAVINGS IT IN

02:03:46.852 --> 02:03:48.788
OTHER WORDS IT ONLY ACCOUNT FOR

02:03:48.854 --> 02:03:50.289
THE INCREASED COST OF PURCHASING

02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:52.625
VEHICLES MORE REGULARLY BUT

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:53.692
DOESN'T ACCOUNT.

02:03:53.759 --> 02:03:54.260
FOR WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE

02:03:54.326 --> 02:03:56.796
LIKELY REDUCTION IN REPAIR

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:58.531
MAINTENANCE BETTER FROM HAVING A

02:03:58.597 --> 02:04:01.367
YOUNGER WE ALL ALL ALL TOGETHER.

02:04:01.433 --> 02:04:02.902
I CAN'T I'M GIVEN THE WAY THAT

02:04:02.968 --> 02:04:03.469
IS.

02:04:03.536 --> 02:04:05.404
THAT THESE PLANS ARE SCHEDULED

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:06.806
OUT IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET BELT

02:04:06.872 --> 02:04:07.873
IT APARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO RE

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:10.409
DIRECT MONEY TO OTHER PURPOSES --

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:12.344
IF IT DID THIS IT WOULD -- AND

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:14.814
INCREASED FUEL MAINTENANCE AND

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:17.583
REPAIR [inaudible]

02:04:17.650 --> 02:04:18.517
WE WAIT.

02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:21.253
OLDER ON AVERAGE.

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:24.356
AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:25.925
REQUIRING CDC ARE TO ASK ME

02:04:25.991 --> 02:04:27.927

02:04:28.961 --> 02:04:31.764
OF FUEL AND RETAIL VALUES.

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:34.166
WOULD LIKELY BE ACHIEVED UNDER

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:35.534
THE PROPOSAL.

02:04:35.601 --> 02:04:36.635
THEN WE RECOMMEND THE

02:04:36.702 --> 02:04:37.369
LEGISLATURE REDUCE THE

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:38.771
DEPARTMENT BUDGET BY THAT AMOUNT.

02:04:38.838 --> 02:04:39.972
AND IMPROVE THE THIRTY TWO

02:04:40.039 --> 02:04:41.240
MILLION IN A SEPARATE

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:44.276
APPROPRIATION OF THAT THE ARMY

02:04:44.343 --> 02:04:44.643

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.745
ARE SAID.

02:04:46.812 --> 02:04:48.414

WE EXPECT ANY READ EFFICIENCIES

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:10.102
IN THAT AREA WOULD BE REDIRECTED

02:05:10.169 --> 02:05:11.337
INTO A BETTER AND MORE FREQUENT

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:13.339

BUT TO BASE OUR WORK -- IN A

02:09:27.259 --> 02:09:30.496
RESEARCH RIBBON AND DATA DRIVEN.

02:09:30.562 --> 02:09:32.598
WHAT THE PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW US

I'M ON TRACK.

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:39.538
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DEVELOP A

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:41.840
STATEWIDE MONITORING BRAIN WORK.

02:09:41.907 --> 02:09:43.375
AND THAT FRAMEWORK BASICALLY

02:09:43.442 --> 02:09:45.544
WOULD IDENTIFY BOTH PUBLICLY

02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:48.447
FACING AS WELL AS NON PUBLICLY

02:09:48.514 --> 02:09:49.148
PASTING DATABASES.

02:09:49.214 --> 02:09:51.283
THAT CAN GIVE US AND PROVIDE AS

02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:53.252
INDICATORS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:54.419
ARE MAKING APPROPRIATE

02:09:54.486 --> 02:09:55.521
INVESTMENT THAT ARE CONSISTENT

02:09:55.587 --> 02:09:58.991
WITH BEST PRACTICES PREVENTION.

02:09:59.057 --> 02:10:01.126
SO IN SHORT IT WILL GIVE US A

02:10:01.193 --> 02:10:03.095
LITMUS TEST OF THE STATE'S

02:10:03.162 --> 02:10:04.863
INVESTMENT IS SEE IF WE'RE ON

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:05.864

I'M STILL TRYING TO DIVERT

02:10:07.699 --> 02:10:08.967
PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND

02:10:09.034 --> 02:10:10.169
MENTAL HEALTH IT IS.

02:10:10.235 --> 02:10:11.904
INCARCERATION.

02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:13.872
THE STAFF THAT ARE REQUESTED.

02:10:13.939 --> 02:10:16.175
NOT ONLY WILL DEVELOP THE R. E.

02:10:16.241 --> 02:10:17.609
AND AND MANAGE THAT PROCESS BUT

02:10:17.676 --> 02:10:19.478
MORE IMPORTANTLY.

02:10:19.545 --> 02:10:20.846
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE

02:10:20.913 --> 02:10:23.282
FRAMEWORK POPULATE THE FRAMEWORK.

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:25.984
IN HOPES OF CREATING A ON A

02:10:26.051 --> 02:10:27.753
STATE LEVEL LIKE DASHBOARD -- IT

02:10:27.819 --> 02:10:29.321
WOULD HELP US IDENTIFY FOR

02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:33.392
EXAMPLE -- IF WE SEE A SPIKE.

02:10:33.458 --> 02:10:34.393
IN LOOKING AT VITAL STATISTICS

02:10:34.459 --> 02:10:37.095
THAT PEOPLE ARE AND TIME BY --

02:10:37.162 --> 02:10:38.764
OVERDOSE OR THEY'RE ENTERING

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:39.932
INTO JAHRES.

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:42.568
M. THIRTY DAYS AFTER RELEASE WE

02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:44.670
MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THAT IT

02:10:44.736 --> 02:10:46.905
PROVIDES AS INDICATION OF WHERE

02:10:46.972 --> 02:10:50.008
WE AS A COUNCIL. TO DIVE DEEPER

02:10:50.075 --> 02:10:51.076
INTO CRITICAL.

02:10:51.143 --> 02:10:53.812
RIGHT NOW -- WE HAVE AN ARRAY OF

02:10:53.879 --> 02:10:55.347
STAKEHOLDERS.

02:10:55.414 --> 02:10:55.981
I'M THAT.

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:58.217
ASK AT LOOK AT CERTAIN USED.

02:10:58.283 --> 02:11:00.786
THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO ALSO USE

02:11:00.852 --> 02:11:04.256
DATA. TO HELP US DETERMINE WHAT

02:11:04.323 --> 02:11:05.624
ISSUES WE WANT TO LOOK AT I'M

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:07.526
FINALLY I THINK ONE OF THE

02:11:07.593 --> 02:11:08.961
THINGS THAT IS THE AN ADDITIONAL

02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:10.295
BENEFIT FROM THIS PARTICULAR

02:11:10.362 --> 02:11:12.564
PROJECT.

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:14.266
I HAVE BEEN A RESEARCH SIGN.

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:15.200
THE SUPPORTING RESEARCH

02:11:15.267 --> 02:11:16.902
SCIENTIST.

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:19.204
ONE WE CAN ACTUALLY -- STAFFING

02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:20.973
CONTINUE WORK GUARDED.

02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:22.874
WHICH IS WITH COUNTY RESEARCHERS

02:11:22.941 --> 02:11:25.644
AND UP AND THESE ARE RESEARCHERS

02:11:25.711 --> 02:11:27.479
WERE BOTH.

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:30.649
EXCITED WELL AS THE HEALTH SIDE.

02:11:30.716 --> 02:11:31.650
REALLY IDENTIFY BARRIERS.

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:34.519
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT HAS TO

02:11:34.586 --> 02:11:35.120
BENEFITS ONE OF COURSE IS JUST

02:11:35.187 --> 02:11:35.420
[inaudible]

02:11:35.487 --> 02:11:37.122
AIR.

02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:38.423
THESE PEOPLE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:11:38.490 --> 02:11:40.158
TRANSITION FOR A LOT OF SYSTEMS

02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:42.294
AND AND THE RECORDS THAT THEY

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:43.295
HAVE.

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:43.962
EARLY FOLLOW THEM WHEREVER THEY

02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:47.899
GO -- BUT ALSO -- IMPORTANTLY

02:11:47.966 --> 02:11:49.668
FOR RESEARCH IN A VALUATION.

02:11:49.735 --> 02:11:52.070
HAVE A BETTER SENSE I'M.

02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:54.106
OF WHICH PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:55.807
WORKING.

02:11:55.874 --> 02:11:57.242
PEOPLE PERMITS THAT IS THAT.

02:11:57.309 --> 02:11:58.243
WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET SOME

02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:59.544
RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET A COUPLE

02:11:59.611 --> 02:12:00.345
YEARS AGO.

02:12:00.412 --> 02:12:02.581
AND HE LAUNCHED A MEDICAL

02:12:02.648 --> 02:12:03.382
UTILITY RIGHT THAT.

02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:05.183
AND RIGHTLY THAT PROJECT ALLOWS

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:08.720
US TO MATCH -- INFORMATION FROM

02:12:08.787 --> 02:12:12.057
THE ART MEDICAL DATABASE. TO

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:12.591
WHETHER OR NOT INDIVIDUALS

02:12:12.658 --> 02:12:13.225
EXITING.

02:12:13.292 --> 02:12:15.827
WE ARE ARE UTILIZING THEIR

02:12:15.894 --> 02:12:17.896
MEDICAL BENEFIT AT WHAT EXTENT

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:19.464
ARE THEY DOING IT OUTPATIENT

02:12:19.531 --> 02:12:20.899
SETTING ARE THEY DOING TO MANAGE

02:12:20.966 --> 02:12:22.434
ON A MISSION.

02:12:22.501 --> 02:12:24.269
AND I THINK THAT THAT WHOLE

02:12:24.336 --> 02:12:25.170
PROJECT.

02:12:25.237 --> 02:12:27.005
A LOT ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO

02:12:27.072 --> 02:12:27.939
DEDICATE.

02:12:28.006 --> 02:12:30.642
MY MAIN REASON IS THE BETTER-UNDERSTANDING THE BARRIERS TO

02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:32.611
DATA SHARING.

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:36.014
AND SO IT'LL BE REALLY HELPFUL

02:12:36.081 --> 02:12:38.550
TO HAVE A PERSON AND TO LEAVE

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:40.285
THAT WORK GROUP AND HAVE.

02:12:40.352 --> 02:12:42.054

UTILIZING GENERAL FUND RESOURCES.

02:12:55.434 --> 02:12:56.735
WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE COUNCIL

02:12:56.802 --> 02:12:58.470
THE MORE APPROPRIATELY FOCUS ON

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:00.072
PAROLEES ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:02.474
INDIVIDUALS AS OPPOSED A MENTAL

HEALTH SERVICE ACT FUNDS WHICH

02:13:05.110 --> 02:13:05.677
IS HOW THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN

AND WE HAD A PARTICULAR.

02:15:01.226 --> 02:15:02.861
AREA OF RESEARCH THAT WE FELT

02:15:02.928 --> 02:15:04.129
WAS NECESSARY.

02:15:04.196 --> 02:15:05.897
THEN IT MIGHT BE MORE

02:15:05.964 --> 02:15:07.666
APPROPRIATE TO THE MISSION IT.

02:15:07.732 --> 02:15:09.201
BACK.

02:15:09.267 --> 02:15:11.770
VERSUS ADDING FOR PEOPLE WHEN

02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:29.180
BEING RAISED.

02:31:29.246 --> 02:31:30.614
OUR STATUTE REPRESENTS A

02:31:30.681 --> 02:31:32.550
IDENTIFIES I WILL BE ABOUT AND

02:31:32.616 --> 02:31:34.685
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE ARE YOU

02:31:34.752 --> 02:31:38.422
AT UNTIL -- MOST OF IT IS IS

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:40.791
FOCUSED ON PROMOTING WHAT WE ALL

02:31:40.858 --> 02:31:42.760
BEST PRACTICES SO I THINK. ONE

02:31:42.827 --> 02:31:44.929
OF THE REASONS THAT I HAVE

02:31:44.995 --> 02:31:46.163
CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON GROWING THE

02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:48.265
AT THE AT THE COUNCIL WITH

02:31:48.332 --> 02:31:51.035
RESEARCH THAT IS AS OUR STATUTE

02:31:51.101 --> 02:31:52.736
SAYS THAT.

02:31:52.803 --> 02:31:53.304
WE SHOULD BASE OUR

02:31:53.370 --> 02:31:56.340
RECOMMENDATION FORM ALL THE

02:31:56.407 --> 02:31:57.374
STATE ON PAYDAY [inaudible]

02:31:57.441 --> 02:31:59.276
SO.

02:31:59.343 --> 02:32:01.912
THOSE ARE LIMITED -- TO OPPOSING

02:32:01.979 --> 02:32:03.881
GAINES.

02:32:03.948 --> 02:32:05.816
I I AND I THINK TOO I JUST TO BE

02:32:05.883 --> 02:32:06.884
FAIR -- THE COUNCIL'S BEEN

02:32:06.951 --> 02:32:08.819
FUNDED WITH MENTAL HEALTH

02:32:08.886 --> 02:32:11.355
SERVICE AT FUNDING SO THE PLAN.

02:32:11.422 --> 02:32:13.023
YES OF THE BAND HAS BEEN THE

02:32:13.090 --> 02:32:16.827
SORT OF THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON ON

02:32:16.894 --> 02:32:18.796
PROJECTS THAT RELATE THAT CAN BE

02:32:18.863 --> 02:32:20.664
USED WITH THAT SORT OF FUNDING.

02:32:20.731 --> 02:32:22.099
THIS FOR THIS PROPOSAL ITSELF IS

02:32:22.166 --> 02:32:24.268
ASKING GENERAL FUND WHICH WOULD

02:32:24.335 --> 02:32:25.469
ALLOW THE COUNCIL TO GET INTO.

02:32:25.536 --> 02:32:26.971
AREAS THAT THEY HADN'T

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:31.609
PREVIOUSLY GOTTEN AND AND WHY

02:32:31.675 --> 02:32:35.179
DON'T WE JUST ASK FOR MORE MONEY

02:32:35.246 --> 02:32:35.479
[inaudible]

02:32:35.546 --> 02:32:39.650
BOTTOM LINE [inaudible] TO AN WE

02:32:39.717 --> 02:32:41.185
SPECIFICALLY WANTED OF STATE

02:32:41.252 --> 02:32:42.953
GENERAL FUND BECAUSE WE WANTED

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:45.723
TO DO MORE WORK LOOKING AT THE

02:32:45.789 --> 02:32:49.326
USE OF ROWLEY'S RPN TRAIN AND

02:32:49.393 --> 02:32:51.629
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A PRIORITY.

02:32:51.695 --> 02:32:54.331
LEGISLATURE.

02:32:54.398 --> 02:32:56.133
REST AND MOVE THAT SYSTEM AS A

02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:57.067
PRIORITY.

02:32:57.134 --> 02:32:59.303
ARE MEANT TO MOVE REHABILITATING

02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:00.771
THREE AND THREE SO I THINK WE

02:33:00.838 --> 02:33:03.507
FELT A LITTLE BIT LIMITED

02:33:03.574 --> 02:33:04.742
BECAUSE WE WERE ONLY FUNDED WITH

02:33:04.808 --> 02:33:05.409
MENTAL HEALTH.

02:33:05.476 --> 02:33:07.211
THAT FELLERS.

02:33:07.278 --> 02:33:09.313
WE HAVE A THERE'S THE WHOLE

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:11.849
REALM OF THE WORK THAT WE DO

02:33:11.916 --> 02:33:13.417
WITH EDGES.

02:33:13.484 --> 02:33:14.818
ATTORNEYS AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS

02:33:14.885 --> 02:33:15.519
TO HAVE COME TO US SAYING THAT

02:33:15.586 --> 02:33:15.786
THEY ARE.

02:33:15.853 --> 02:33:16.720
INTERESTED IN PARTNERING MORE

02:33:16.787 --> 02:33:18.622
AND SO THIS GIVES US A LITTLE

02:33:18.689 --> 02:33:24.828
BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR US TO

02:33:24.895 --> 02:33:27.698
IDENTIFY PROJECT.

02:33:27.765 --> 02:33:27.898
THAT.

02:33:27.965 --> 02:33:29.233
ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO PREVENTION

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:31.101
EARLY INTERVENTION.

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:31.368
AND ONLY.

02:33:31.435 --> 02:33:35.539
A RIGHT I THINK THEY WERE VERY

02:33:35.606 --> 02:33:36.840
FOR QUESTIONS IN.

02:33:36.907 --> 02:33:37.808
YOU'VE BEEN PUT IN THE HOT SEAT

02:33:37.875 --> 02:33:39.276
WE'RE NEITHER.

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:40.844
UNDER MORE LAUGHTER I WORK.

02:33:40.911 --> 02:33:42.913
IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN YOU'RE

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:44.081
COUNSEL WAS DOUBTLESS.

02:33:44.148 --> 02:33:46.450
AND WELL I'M SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR

02:33:46.517 --> 02:33:46.951
WITH THE STATUTE I THINK

02:33:47.017 --> 02:33:47.251
[inaudible]

02:33:47.318 --> 02:33:50.487
I'M.

02:33:50.554 --> 02:33:53.123
BE CLEAR THE THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:55.826
WHEN AN ESTABLISHING IT FELT TOO

02:33:55.893 --> 02:33:57.928
GREAT NEED AN I'M NOT DESCRIBING

02:33:57.995 --> 02:34:00.598
THAT THERE ISN'T A NEED. FOR OUR

02:34:00.664 --> 02:34:03.067
UNDERSTANDING MANY OF THE ISSUES

02:34:03.133 --> 02:34:06.570
THAT THE COUNSELOR THAT -- MORE

02:34:06.637 --> 02:34:07.571
CLEARLY BETTER PROVING BEST

02:34:07.638 --> 02:34:08.305
PRACTICE.

02:34:08.372 --> 02:34:11.842
I THINK THE THE ISSUE MAY BE

02:34:11.909 --> 02:34:13.077
THAT IS THE SCOPE.

02:34:13.143 --> 02:34:17.014
OF WORK.

02:34:17.081 --> 02:34:18.916
IN A WAY WHEN CONSIDERED AN

02:34:18.983 --> 02:34:19.950
UNLIMITED SCOPE OF WORK

02:34:20.017 --> 02:34:20.250
[inaudible]

02:34:20.317 --> 02:34:24.788
AND DOES. FOR ME ANYWAY DOES.

02:34:24.855 --> 02:34:26.056
YOU ADDITIONAL F. B. E. REALLY

02:34:26.123 --> 02:34:28.058
ACCOMPLISH IT OR NOT OR WHETHER

02:34:28.125 --> 02:34:30.160
WE SHOULD BE APPROACHING THIS.

02:34:30.227 --> 02:34:32.863
WAY AND PERHAPS IT'S SOMETHING

02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:34.398
WHERE WE INLAND.

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:37.201
THE REAL LOOK AT AS ACTED IN THE

02:34:37.267 --> 02:34:38.402
REACHED NUMBER IN WHETHER.

02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:43.707
IT FITS YOUR NEEDS NOW.

02:34:43.774 --> 02:34:45.275
AND THEN A N. WHETHER THE TYPE

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:46.644
OF FUNCTION.

02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:47.411
THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS

02:34:47.478 --> 02:34:49.446
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HOUSE.

02:34:49.513 --> 02:34:50.080
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE LOOKING

02:34:50.147 --> 02:34:52.316
AT YOU'RE DOING RESEARCH IN

02:34:52.383 --> 02:34:54.818
REVIEWING.

02:34:54.885 --> 02:34:56.854
AREAS OF PRACTICE WITHIN CTR

02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:59.056
CLEARLY BUT SHOULD IT BE HOUSE

02:34:59.123 --> 02:35:01.058
DIRECTLY.

02:35:01.125 --> 02:35:02.693
UNDER IN REPORTING.

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:06.196
OUR I THINK THAT MAY BE ANOTHER

02:35:06.263 --> 02:35:09.700
LEGITIMATE QUESTION.

02:35:09.767 --> 02:35:11.235
A SIMILAR.

02:35:11.301 --> 02:35:14.605
TO NOT THAT REFERENCE BUT THERE

02:35:14.672 --> 02:35:16.373
WAS A REFERENCE BY MR WIDELY AS

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:17.641
WHETHER.

02:35:17.708 --> 02:35:20.878
RULE BOARD SHOULD BE HIRING THE

02:35:20.944 --> 02:35:22.146
LAWYERS.

02:35:22.212 --> 02:35:23.747
THAT ARE GONNA THEN BE.

02:35:23.814 --> 02:35:25.349
I MEAN BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD

02:35:25.416 --> 02:35:26.950
RIGHT THERE WAS THAT SO THERE'S

02:35:27.017 --> 02:35:29.853
ALWAYS THAT -- WHAT'S WHAT IS

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:32.322
OUR PURPOSE FOR AN END TO BE AND

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:34.725
WHAT SITS ATOP THE MALL

02:35:34.792 --> 02:35:36.660
REPORTING STRUCTURE. TO ACHIEVE

02:35:36.727 --> 02:35:40.864
THAT WHICH YOU KNOW WE MAY YEAH --

02:35:40.931 --> 02:35:45.135
I THINK. FOR US WELL THIS WASN'T.

02:35:45.202 --> 02:35:47.604

02:35:51.408 --> 02:35:54.311
I THINK FOR THOSE BLESSED WERE.

02:35:54.378 --> 02:35:55.946
I'M NOT NUDE YET I HAVEN'T SEEN

02:35:56.013 --> 02:35:57.481
REPORTS EITHER JUST TRYING TO

02:35:57.548 --> 02:35:58.415
UNDERSTAND BETTER.

02:35:58.482 --> 02:35:59.683
THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF THE

02:35:59.750 --> 02:36:00.751
COUNCIL AND WHAT AND HOW IT FITS

02:36:00.818 --> 02:36:01.719

THERE'S BEEN MUCH.

02:36:10.728 --> 02:36:12.796
ANYWAY SO I THINK IT'S WORTH THE

02:36:12.863 --> 02:36:14.832
REST.

02:36:14.898 --> 02:36:16.667

OF OUR QUESTIONS. ONE IN A WAY

02:36:31.715 --> 02:36:34.318
IT WAS MORE IN EDUCATION FOR US

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:36.320
RATHER THAN SO MUCH HEAT NOT FOR

02:36:36.386 --> 02:36:38.722

WHILE.

02:37:32.342 --> 02:37:35.012
REALIGNMENT WAS CLEARLY ENHANCED

02:37:35.078 --> 02:37:36.613
AT LEAST WHEN I WAS IN THE

02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:38.382
LEGISLATURE IT WASN'T STARTED IT

02:37:38.448 --> 02:37:39.583
WAS START IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS

02:37:39.650 --> 02:37:41.351
STARTED PRIOR.

02:37:41.418 --> 02:37:44.354
AND EVEN YES HE SEES EXISTENCE

02:37:44.421 --> 02:37:45.856
HAS BEEN SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE

02:37:45.923 --> 02:37:48.025
LEGISLATURE BUT THIS WHOLE.

02:37:48.091 --> 02:37:50.928
ROLLER YES CC.

BEEN -- NOT JUST GROWING OR

02:37:59.803 --> 02:38:05.876
MAYBE NOT GROWING IS IT.

02:38:05.943 --> 02:38:07.411
IN THE TRANSITION THAT THE STATE

02:38:07.477 --> 02:38:09.179
WAS UNDERTAKING BACK IN

02:38:09.246 --> 02:38:09.479
[inaudible]

02:38:09.546 --> 02:38:11.615
TWENTY ELEVEN THERE WAS.

02:38:11.682 --> 02:38:13.784
CLEAR NEED TO ALL RIGHT WE'RE

02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:15.319
MAKING A BIG TRANSITION WE

02:38:15.385 --> 02:38:15.819
BETTER HAVE SOMEBODY BE

02:38:15.886 --> 02:38:18.222
MONITORING -- BUT I THINK SOME

02:38:18.288 --> 02:38:19.223
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD

02:38:19.289 --> 02:38:21.825
SO FAR.

02:38:21.892 --> 02:38:23.260
I'M MOSTLY IN PUBLIC COMMENT BUT

02:38:23.327 --> 02:38:26.096
IS FULL ISSUE OF YOU KNOW WHAT.

02:38:26.163 --> 02:38:27.631

WHAT IS THE MONEY THAT STATE IS

02:38:47.618 --> 02:38:48.719
PROVIDING THE COUNTIES UNDER

02:38:48.785 --> 02:38:50.821
REALIGNMENT AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE

02:38:50.888 --> 02:38:52.356
AND WHAT'S THE RELATION EITHER

02:38:52.422 --> 02:38:54.424
BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

02:38:54.491 --> 02:38:56.126

CHANGES BEING NECESSARY.

02:43:10.514 --> 02:43:11.481
HOWEVER TO THE EXTENT THE

02:43:11.548 --> 02:43:13.150
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO ENSURE THAT

02:43:13.216 --> 02:43:14.651

MORE TO MORE TRAINING IN. TWENTY

02:43:20.924 --> 02:43:21.424
NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT COULD

02:43:21.491 --> 02:43:22.292
CREATE A SEPARATE PROGRAM AND

02:43:22.359 --> 02:43:24.661

SIX POINT TWO MILLION TO DO WHAT

02:43:52.455 --> 02:43:54.224
YOU'RE ALREADY DOING -- AND SO

02:43:54.291 --> 02:43:55.992
THAT [inaudible]

02:43:56.059 --> 02:43:57.494
MY NATURAL.

02:43:57.561 --> 02:44:02.832
WANT TO COMMENT.

02:44:02.899 --> 02:44:03.633
THE COUNTY IS A REALLY

02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:05.602
STRUGGLING I THINK RIGHT NOW

02:44:05.669 --> 02:44:07.437
WITH ALL OF BEING COMMAND SO I

02:44:07.504 --> 02:44:08.972
THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT'S

02:44:09.039 --> 02:44:10.507
PAST PERFORMANCE AND IT'S BEEN

02:44:10.574 --> 02:44:12.209
GREAT AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE

02:44:12.275 --> 02:44:14.177
WORKING VERY VERY HARD TO ENSURE

02:44:14.244 --> 02:44:15.879
ALL THEIR STAFF ARE TRAINED.

02:44:15.946 --> 02:44:17.380
BUT THOSE DEMANDS STRESSED KEEP

02:44:17.447 --> 02:44:19.849
COMING IN THERE ARE BIGGER AND

02:44:19.916 --> 02:44:20.584
THE I AM.

02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:22.686
FOCUS RIGHT NOW ON PROVIDING OF

02:44:22.752 --> 02:44:24.254
REALLY GOOD BEHAVIOR HEALTH

02:44:24.321 --> 02:44:26.156
TRAINING IN THIS REALLY BROAD

02:44:26.223 --> 02:44:29.025
UMBRELLA IS GREAT AND THAT'S

02:44:29.092 --> 02:44:30.527
LONG AND EXPENSIVE TRAINING.

02:44:30.594 --> 02:44:32.329
SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FACED

02:44:32.395 --> 02:44:34.197
WITH NOW IN THAT CONTINUING TO

02:44:34.264 --> 02:44:36.032
CHALLENGE THEM AND AT THE

02:44:36.099 --> 02:44:36.700
REQUEST FOR THIS FUNDING IS TO

02:44:36.766 --> 02:44:37.767
HELP.

02:44:37.834 --> 02:44:39.269
OFFSET SOME OF THOSE ADDITIONAL

02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:42.072
COSTS FOR SOME OF THAT MORE AT

02:44:42.138 --> 02:44:43.273
AN EXPENSIVE AND LENGTHY --

02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:45.175
TRAINING THAT REALLY IS CRITICAL

02:44:45.242 --> 02:44:46.343
TO AND THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL JOB

02:44:46.409 --> 02:44:50.347
PERFORMANCE AND THE SAFETY OF

02:44:50.413 --> 02:44:50.947
THE FACILITIES THAT THEY WORK

02:44:51.014 --> 02:44:53.717
AND THE ISSUE IS WHY YOU GAVE US

02:44:53.783 --> 02:44:54.651
THAT VERBAL WHEN I READ THE B.

02:44:54.718 --> 02:44:55.452
C. P. THERE'S NO.

02:44:55.518 --> 02:44:58.521
IT DOESN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT LIKE

02:44:58.588 --> 02:45:00.190
THAT THERE'S THIS NEED.

02:45:00.257 --> 02:45:02.292
IN A THERE'S YOU KNOW THIS GAP

02:45:02.359 --> 02:45:04.027
IN THE TRAINING WE PROVIDE.

02:45:04.094 --> 02:45:07.864
AND THUS WE NEED THIS FUNDING.

02:45:07.931 --> 02:45:09.899
TO PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL

02:45:09.966 --> 02:45:12.102
TRAINING THAT IS.

02:45:12.168 --> 02:45:14.504
REALLY NOT IN THERE.

02:45:14.571 --> 02:45:16.606
YEAH THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT CARDS

02:45:16.673 --> 02:45:18.475
OF TRAINING AND ONE IS THE

02:45:18.541 --> 02:45:20.543
TRAINING THAT ONE RECEIVES WHEN

02:45:20.610 --> 02:45:22.445
THEY ARE FIRST EMPLOYED IN A JOB

02:45:22.512 --> 02:45:23.246
AND THAT SORT OF RIGHT TO ME

02:45:23.313 --> 02:45:24.247
SOUTH TRAINING IN THESE ARE THE

02:45:24.314 --> 02:45:25.215
VERY LENGTHY.

02:45:25.282 --> 02:45:27.450
TRAININGS AND WE ARE ACTUALLY

02:45:27.517 --> 02:45:28.818
BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE A COUPLE

02:45:28.885 --> 02:45:30.186
OF YEARS AGO TO REQUEST SOME

02:45:30.253 --> 02:45:31.121
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DO A

02:45:31.187 --> 02:45:33.657
COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THESE

02:45:33.723 --> 02:45:35.692
JOBS TO DETERMINE HOW THEIR JOBS

02:45:35.759 --> 02:45:36.960
HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME.

02:45:37.027 --> 02:45:38.328
AND WHAT SORT OF NEW ADDITIONAL

02:45:38.395 --> 02:45:40.030
TRAINING THEY MIGHT NEED TO

02:45:40.096 --> 02:45:41.498
SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM THOSE JOBS.

02:45:41.564 --> 02:45:42.932

ON THE ANNUAL SIDE THAT'S A

02:46:20.937 --> 02:46:22.305
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

ALL OF THAT ON AT THE ANNUAL

02:46:35.185 --> 02:46:37.654
SIDE WE SIMPLY REQUIRING THIS IS

02:46:37.721 --> 02:46:38.421
WHERE THE LA WAS TALKING ABOUT

02:46:38.488 --> 02:46:40.690
THE CONTENT ISN'T TRACKED WHAT

02:46:40.757 --> 02:46:42.759
WE DO REQUIRES A NUMBER OF HOURS

OF THOSE HOURS AND THAT IS

02:46:49.199 --> 02:46:52.102
BECAUSE THE NEEDS OF THAT

02:46:52.168 --> 02:46:55.905
TRAINING VERY IS IT VARIES BY.

02:46:55.972 --> 02:46:56.706
BY COUNTY IT VARIES BY THE

02:46:56.773 --> 02:46:58.408
INDIVIDUAL WHO'S GOING TO BE

02:46:58.475 --> 02:47:00.310
TRAINED SO WE'VE REALLY LEAVE

EMPLOYING AGENCIES.

02:47:03.813 --> 02:47:04.981
AND THAT IS THE PIECE THAT IS IN

02:47:05.048 --> 02:47:06.616
THIS PERSPECTIVE AND THAT IS THE

02:47:06.683 --> 02:47:07.917
PIECE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

02:47:07.984 --> 02:47:12.222
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT TIME.

02:47:12.288 --> 02:47:14.190
TO PROVIDE A LOT MORE OF THIS

02:47:14.257 --> 02:47:16.192
I'M AB ON BEHAVIOR HEALTH

02:47:16.259 --> 02:47:17.093
TRAINING THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:18.928
NECESSARILY COURTS GOING TO

02:47:18.995 --> 02:47:21.364
PROVIDE A FOUNDATION.

02:47:21.431 --> 02:47:23.967
MAYBE YOU ALL JUST NEED -- YEAH

02:47:24.033 --> 02:47:25.268
NOT TRYING TO PREDICT THE

02:47:25.335 --> 02:47:27.237
OUTCOME OF OUR DELIBERATIONS BUT

02:47:27.303 --> 02:47:30.273
IF YOU READ THIS BCP.

02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:33.109
I'M SORRY BUT IT SAYS.

02:47:33.176 --> 02:47:37.747
B. I'M THERE IS A TRAINING THE

02:47:37.814 --> 02:47:39.549
THERE WAS FOUNDED TRAINING GAP

02:47:39.616 --> 02:47:41.818
ANALYSIS OR BETTER BEHAVIORAL.

02:47:41.885 --> 02:47:43.119
HEALTH TRAINING BUT THEN IT SAYS

02:47:43.186 --> 02:47:45.121
THE CORE TRAINING NOW INCLUDES

02:47:45.188 --> 02:47:46.356
IN IT LISTS MANY ASPECTS OF

02:47:46.423 --> 02:47:47.557
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THAT ARE IN

02:47:47.624 --> 02:47:48.725
THE CORE TRAINING.

02:47:48.792 --> 02:47:51.428
AND IT DOESN'T INDICATE WHICH

02:47:51.494 --> 02:47:53.296
ASPECT OF THIS BEHAVIOR ALL THE

02:47:53.363 --> 02:47:54.164
WOULD NEED TO BE ENHANCED IT

02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:55.732
SAYS A GREAT AMOUNT OF IT

02:47:55.799 --> 02:47:57.534
SUBSTANCE ABUSE INTERVENTIONS

02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:59.068
RESOURCES SUICIDE PREVENTION

02:47:59.135 --> 02:48:00.069
IT'S ARTS CENTER.

02:48:00.136 --> 02:48:01.271
AND THEN WE HAVE THE DATA THAT

02:48:01.337 --> 02:48:03.106
SHOWS ONLY FORTY SEVEN OF THE

02:48:03.173 --> 02:48:04.641
PEOPLE DIDN'T GET IT YET.

02:48:04.707 --> 02:48:06.376
SO.

02:48:06.443 --> 02:48:08.478
A AND THEN THE VERY BOTTOM MRS

AGENCIES CAN MEET THE STATE

02:48:13.216 --> 02:48:15.285
TRAINING STANDARDS FOR THE

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:16.219
CORRECTION WHICH IS THE CORE

02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:16.486
TRAINING.

02:48:16.553 --> 02:48:18.721
MAJORITY MEETING THEM SO ANYWAY

02:48:18.788 --> 02:48:20.190
THAT'S I THINK JUST ONE CLEAR

02:48:20.256 --> 02:48:21.991
FINE POINT IS THAT WE DID DO

02:48:22.058 --> 02:48:23.760
THIS COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE

02:48:23.827 --> 02:48:25.895

02:48:33.870 --> 02:48:35.271
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHY THIS

RIGHT NOW.

02:48:37.774 --> 02:48:39.275

02:52:18.961 --> 02:52:20.630
CLARITY ABOUT HOW THIS FUNDING

02:52:20.697 --> 02:52:22.732
