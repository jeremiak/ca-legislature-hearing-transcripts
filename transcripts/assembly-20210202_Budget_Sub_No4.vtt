MORE. COMPLEXITY THAN WE

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:47.037
ANTICIPATE RIGHT NOW. AND BY

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:48.038

ALAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:55.351
ANALYST OFFICE. ADAM CHAIR-

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:56.552
CHAD ALLEN- WITH THE

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:57.887
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

01:00:57.954 --> 01:00:59.655
JUST A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS AND-

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.991
AND- PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE WITH

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.693
REGARD TO THAT THE GOLDEN STATE

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.427
STIMULUS PROPOSAL IN THE

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:07.196
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ON FIRST. WE

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.699
THINK NOW IS THE TIME TO USE

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:12.035
ONE TIME MONEY FOR UP AND

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:13.102
DEMOCRATS LEAF WE THINK THAT

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:14.937
MAKES SENSE- GIVEN THE NATURE

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:16.806
OF THE STATE'S REVENUE WINDFALL

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.241
IN THE BUDGET YEAR. I'M USING

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:19.709
THESE ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ONE

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.644
TIME RELIEF EFFORTS APPEARS TO

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:23.613
BE THE RIGHT APPROACH. I'M

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:27.483
CERTAINLY. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:29.185
BEING PROPOSED- AS PART OF THE

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:30.787
STIMULUS PAYMENTS REPRESENT A

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.188
RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE OF THE

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:33.689
STATE'S OVERALL ECONOMY SO THE

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:35.158
FOCUS ISN'T NECESSARILY ON

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:37.627
ECONOMIC STIMULUS. ON RATHER

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:39.729
REVIEW THE FOCUS AS FILLING IN

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.264
THE GAPS IN UNPRECEDENTED

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.966
FEDERAL RELIEF PROGRAMS- THAT

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.501
HAVE BEEN ENACTED DURING THE

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.870
PANDEMIC MOST NOTABLY THE- I'M

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.272
FISCAL STIMULUS CHECKS THAT

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:51.207
TAXPAYERS RECEIVED AS WELL AS-

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:54.110
ENHANCED YOU I BENEFITS. THAT

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.912
I'M UNEMPLOYED WORKERS RECEIVED

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:58.981
THROUGHOUT. TWENTY TWENTY. ONE

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:01.184
IN A IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.119
TARGETING THE STIMULUS CHECKS

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:06.422
FOR- TO TWENTY NINETEEN EIT

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.758
RECIPIENTS IS THE BEST APPROACH

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.426
AT THIS TIME AND THE MAIN

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:13.229
REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE-

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:14.097
TWENTY NINETEEN EITC

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:17.300
RECIPIENTS. ARM WERE ELIGIBLE

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.468
THIS LAST YEAR DURING THE

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:19.802
PANDEMIC FOR THOSE FEDERAL

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.571
STIMULUS CHECKS AS WELL AS

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:23.573
ENHANCED YOU I PENNED OF IT

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:26.909
PAYMENTS. ON WE THINK INSTEAD

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.177
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD TAKE

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.245
SOME TIME NOW TO CONSIDER

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:31.414
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES- AND

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:32.648
THAT THE OVER ARCHING QUESTION

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:34.617
WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:36.119
GRAPPLE WITH AS IT CONSIDERS

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.054
ITS OWN APPROACH IS WHICH

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:39.922
GROUPS OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:42.024
HAVE BENEFITED LEAST. FROM

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.759
FEDERALLY MEASURES AT THIS

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:47.497
POINT- AND SERVE USING THAT

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:50.766
QUESTION AS OUR GUIDING. MARK

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.336
WE DO PROPOSE A AN ALTERNATIVE

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.470
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.105
CONSIDER AT THIS TIME AND IN

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.473
ESSENCE IT'S A MORE TARGETED

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.841
PROPOSAL THAN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:00.643
GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS I'M

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.112
INSTEAD OF PROVIDING SIX

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:03.746
HUNDRED DOLLAR BENEFIT PAYMENTS

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:06.549
TO- EITC RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.451
I TEND FILERS WHO RECEIVE THE

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.353
EITC THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:11.687
CONSIDER MORE NARROWLY

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:14.223
TARGETING SUPPORT. FOR THE I.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:17.293
TEN PILAR SPECIFICALLY- UNDER A

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.762
SIMILAR INCOME THRESHOLD- SAY

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:20.429
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:22.064
YEAR AND THIS MORE TARGETED

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:25.968
APPROACH WOULD DIRECT STATE

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.403
RESOURCES TO MORE. EFFECTIVELY

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:28.938
FILL IN THE GAPS IN FEDERAL

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:31.007
RELIEF PROGRAMS BECAUSE I TEN

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:33.176
FILERS WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:35.478
THE FEDERAL STIMULUS CHECKS. OR

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:37.046
ENHANCED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:38.514
BENEFITS IN THE LAST YEAR

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:40.917
WHEREAS EITC FILERS WERE

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:42.685
ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS.

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:45.454
I'M WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:47.456
TARGETED APPROACH YOU COULD.

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:49.091
YOU COULD LOOK AT PROVIDING

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:52.228
BENEFITS TO. ITIN FILERS BASED

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:55.464
ON THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN OR

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:56.766
TWENTY TWENTY INCOME LEVELS AND

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.234
THIS WOULD ALLOW SOME OF THE

01:03:58.301 --> 01:03:59.335
CHECKS TO BE DISTRIBUTED RATHER

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:01.971
QUICKLY- AS JUST AN EXAMPLE AS

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.073
SORT OF AN ILLUSTRATION- WE

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.374
BELIEVE THE STATE TO PROVIDE A

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:07.376
LARGER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:10.179
BENEFIT PER ADULT FILER WHO

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:12.315
FILED WITHIN HIGH TEN. WITH

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.650
EARNINGS ARE UNDER THIRTY

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:16.919
THOUSAND DOLLARS- AND THAT THIS

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.087
APPROACH WOULD LIKELY COST

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.122
BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.358
DOLLARS AND A BILLION DOLLARS-

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:24.293
BECAUSE THIS MORE TARGETED

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.296
APPROACH- WE BELIEVE WOULD-

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:28.698
COST LESS THAN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:31.033
OVERALL PROPOSED- GOLDEN STATE

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.568
STIMULUS PACKAGE. THE

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:34.070
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:35.504
USING THE REMAINING FUND TO

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:36.839
PROVIDE ONE TIME ASSISTANCE TO

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:39.008
OTHER GROUPS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.443
EITHER DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:42.044
AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMICS OR

CONSISTENT WITH OUR OUR

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.103
SUGGESTED APPROACH OF TARGETING

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.904
WHERE FEDERALLY DOLLARS HAVE

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:13.075

PRIOR TO THE FEDERAL STIMULUS

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:31.753
BILL AND THERE'S REAL CONCERN.

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.888

TO SOME EXTENT. HELLO SO THAT

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.871
BEING SAID I THINK WE STILL

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.106

PROPRIETORSHIPS A DIFFERENT

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.285

PILING UP THE TOP TO TURN

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:47.689
THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:50.058
RECESSION SO WE WE'RE WORKING

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.861
CLOSELY WITH TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE

TURN THEY WERE NOT FULLY PAID

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.366

SITUATION TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:48.817
THAT LEVEL IS BECAUSE WE KNOW

FOCUSED AGAIN ON THE LANGUAGE

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:32.420
OF THAT. GRAPHIC REGION SO WE

01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:33.755

STOP THEIR PRODUCT TO DO SO.

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:13.828
AND THE SOFTWARE ITSELF. IS

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:14.729
GOING TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:16.531
CALIFORNIA AGENCY WHETHER THEY

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:25.940
IF THEY WANTED TO THAT PRODUCT

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:27.342
WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:38.019
THE GREAT THING ON SO THAT'S.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:38.753
GOING TO TAKE SOME- PRESS OFF

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:41.055
OF THE OUT BUT OUTRAGE REMAINS

THROUGH THESE QUESTIONS WE

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:51.819
SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE

FILTERING THROUGH THOSE

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:09.970

THAT WE IDENTIFIED SIMPLY FOR

01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:14.208
THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERATION.

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:17.178

01:35:18.946 --> 01:35:21.682
OF FOCUSING ON HIGH TEN FILERS

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:24.118

ORGANIZATIONS TO REACH.

01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:35.896

A SMALLER PROGRAM OF COURSE.

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:48.576
BUT THERE WERE REPORTS OF

01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:49.443

BROADER GROUP AS YOU MENTIONED-

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:57.284
WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE AND THE

02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:22.214
IMPACTED AS WELL AND FROM MANY

02:00:22.281 --> 02:00:23.749
SERVICES BUSINESSES REQUIRE IN

02:00:23.816 --> 02:00:25.751
PERSON CONTACT- TOURISM

02:00:25.818 --> 02:00:30.690
ESPECIALLY WAS IMPACTED RIGHT-

02:00:30.756 --> 02:00:32.725
DETROIT AND MISS FIRST PERSON

02:00:32.792 --> 02:00:34.360
NOTED. THE SPEED AT WHICH THE

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:35.661
CURRENT THE CURRENT PROGRAM WAS

02:00:35.728 --> 02:00:37.797
ESTABLISHED. BOB WAS

02:00:37.863 --> 02:00:38.931
UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN THE

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:41.167
SEVERITY OF THE ECONOMIC

02:00:41.233 --> 02:00:42.234
SITUATION THE TIME AND THE

02:00:42.301 --> 02:00:43.235
UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARDS TO

02:00:43.302 --> 02:00:44.670
WHAT ASSISTANCE MIGHT COME FROM

02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:46.606
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOWEVER-

02:00:46.672 --> 02:00:48.407
AS WE NOTED IN OUR- IN OUR HAND

02:00:48.474 --> 02:00:49.809
OUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF-

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:52.678
PROBLEMS THAT- THAT. THE

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:56.148
BUSINESS APPLICANTS SEND AND

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:57.617
NONPROFITS AND- AND THEIR

02:00:57.683 --> 02:01:00.152
PARTNERS- INDICATED TO US AND

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:03.623
WE LISTED ON PAGE- I THINK PAID

02:01:03.689 --> 02:01:06.125
SIX PER HAND OUT. AND YOU KNOW-

02:01:06.192 --> 02:01:07.893
THE HURRIED EXECUTION LIKELY

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.762
CONTRIBUTED IN PART TO MANY OF

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:12.732
THOSE PROBLEMS- HOWEVER TO BE

02:01:12.798 --> 02:01:14.400
FAIR WE ALSO OBSERVE THAT. MANY

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:16.068
NEW PROGRAMS OFTEN HAVE SOME

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:17.236
UNFORESEEN IMPLEMENTATION

02:01:17.303 --> 02:01:18.237
CHALLENGES AND SO TO SOME

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:20.840
EXTENT THESE PROBLEMS MIGHT

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:21.374
HAVE OCCURRED UNDER OTHER

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:23.442
CIRCUMSTANCES. SO ON PAGE SEVEN

02:01:23.509 --> 02:01:24.944
OF OUR HAND OUT WE DISCUSSED

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:26.812
THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO PARK

02:01:26.879 --> 02:01:29.315
IT THE MOST IMPACTED

02:01:29.382 --> 02:01:31.083
STATE HAS A FAR MORE LIMITED

02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:32.752
CAPACITY TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL

02:01:32.818 --> 02:01:34.687
ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESSES THAN

02:01:34.754 --> 02:01:35.721
DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:37.490
GIVEN THOSE LIMITED STATE

02:01:37.556 --> 02:01:38.924
RESOURCES WE BELIEVE THAT.

02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:40.126
SHOULD GO OUT PROVIDE

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:41.594
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:42.862
TO BUSINESSES THAT SPECIFIC

02:01:42.928 --> 02:01:44.797
TARGETED TO THE BUSINESSES THAT

02:01:44.864 --> 02:01:45.364
WERE MOST AFFECTED BY THE

02:01:45.431 --> 02:01:48.167
PANDEMIC- OBVIOUSLY THE

02:01:48.234 --> 02:01:52.138
EXISTING PROGRAM IS IT'S QUITE

02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:53.773
TARGETED. BUT ON. UNDER THE

02:01:53.839 --> 02:01:54.373
PROGRAM THERE'S ONLY ENOUGH

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.542
FUNDS TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO

02:01:56.609 --> 02:01:57.043
THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND

02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:59.345
BUSINESSES AND- EVEN IF THE

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:00.846
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:03.082
IT. WOULD ROUGHLY DOUBLE THAT

02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:05.184
AMOUNT SIR. EVEN THEN WE

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:06.052
ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE LIKELY

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:07.753
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:08.854
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:10.056
THE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE MOST

02:02:10.122 --> 02:02:10.990
AFFECTED AND IT IS THE NUMBER

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:12.758
TO BE A LOT HIGHER THAN THAT.

02:02:12.825 --> 02:02:15.561
SO- THERE'S JUST STUNT THAT A

02:02:15.628 --> 02:02:16.829
LOT OF BUSINESSES WITH A NEED

02:02:16.896 --> 02:02:18.764
AND- LIMITED RESOURCES SO

02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:21.200
TARGETING SOME PARDON. HELLO WE

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:22.368
NOTE THAT THE CURRENT GRANT

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:24.503
PROGRAM- THOSE TARGET

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:29.075
&lt;c.green&gt;USINESSES IMPORTANT WAYS- BUT&lt;/c&gt;

02:02:29.141 --> 02:02:31.110
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE- THE

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:31.911
GRANTS WERE GOING THEY WERE

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:32.878
DISTRIBUTED PRETTY EVENLY

02:02:32.945 --> 02:02:34.146
ACROSS THE STATE EVEN THOUGH

02:02:34.213 --> 02:02:35.715
DIFFERENT AREAS OF STATE WERE

02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:37.817
UNDER STRICTER- STATE HOME

02:02:37.883 --> 02:02:38.951
ORDERS FOR A LONGER PERIODOF

02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:41.921
TIME FOR EXAMPLE- AND SO THAT

02:02:41.987 --> 02:02:43.589
WASN'T. TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- AS

02:02:43.656 --> 02:02:45.558
AN EXAMPLE OF WAYS THAT TURKEY

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:49.895
MIGHT BE IMPROVED FROM. ON PAGE

02:02:49.962 --> 02:02:50.896
EIGHT NINE WE PROVIDE SOME

02:02:50.963 --> 02:02:52.698
SUGGESTIONS REGARDING-

02:02:52.765 --> 02:02:55.000
CONSIDERATIONS FOR ON THE GRANT

02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:56.602
PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE. IN LIGHT

02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:57.937

ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

02:03:02.208 --> 02:03:03.142
WE THINK IT MIGHT BE PRUDENT

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:04.543
FOR THE LEGISLATURE DEFER

02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:05.644

IMPORTANT POINTS WE WANTED TO

02:45:40.730 --> 02:45:41.531
NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL'S

02:45:41.598 --> 02:45:43.199
RELATIVELY WELL TARGETED TO THE

02:45:43.266 --> 02:45:45.001
BUSINESSES THAT WERE AFFECTED

02:45:45.068 --> 02:45:46.102
BY THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC

02:45:46.169 --> 02:45:47.537
FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST IT WAS

02:45:47.604 --> 02:45:48.905
LIMITED TO THOSE BUSINESSES

02:45:48.972 --> 02:45:49.973
THAT CAN ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATED

02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:51.374
DECLINE OF THE REVENUES AND ITS

02:45:51.441 --> 02:45:53.443
ELIGIBILITY IS LIMITED TO THE

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.943
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE MOST

02:45:54.010 --> 02:45:56.112
AFFECTED. NOW THIS DESIGN DOES

02:45:56.179 --> 02:45:56.846
LEAVE OUT SOME TYPES OF

02:45:56.913 --> 02:45:58.815
BUSINESSES. FOR EXAMPLE NEWLY

02:45:58.882 --> 02:46:00.950
FORMED BUSINESSES THAT MAYBE-

02:46:01.017 --> 02:46:01.785
UNABLE TO DEMONSTRATE A DECLINE

02:46:01.851 --> 02:46:03.887
IN THE REVENUE- OR THOSE WHO

02:46:03.953 --> 02:46:07.424
WERE IMPACTED OR NOT AND- AND

02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:07.891
ONE OF THE IMPACT AND

02:46:07.957 --> 02:46:11.428
DISTRICTS- THE INITIAL CREDIT

02:46:11.494 --> 02:46:12.729
LAST YEAR THAT WITH THE DOCTOR

02:46:12.796 --> 02:46:15.298
MASTERS BUT IT WAS NOT FULLY-

02:46:15.365 --> 02:46:17.133
BUT NOT FULLY USED AND IS. A

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:18.635
MISTER CHAMBERLAIN NOTED

02:46:18.702 --> 02:46:20.637
THEY'RE RECOMMENDING- THE THIRD

02:46:20.704 --> 02:46:22.238
THIRD THERE- THEY'RE IN FAVOR

02:46:22.305 --> 02:46:23.840
OF MOVING. ROLLING OVER THAT

02:46:23.907 --> 02:46:25.975
UNUSED PORTION TO INCREASE THE

02:46:26.042 --> 02:46:27.310
AMOUNT- FROM ONE HUNDRED

02:46:27.377 --> 02:46:29.012
MILLION DOLLARS AND- WE THOUGHT

02:46:29.079 --> 02:46:30.113
THAT COULD HELP ADDRESS SOME OF

02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:33.049
THE ON THE FUNDING NEEDS FOR

02:46:33.116 --> 02:46:35.819
SMALL BUSINESSES. WE ARMS

02:46:35.885 --> 02:46:38.088
SUGGEST TWO WAYS- WE THINK THIS

02:46:38.154 --> 02:46:40.156
PROGRAM AT HAS MERIT AND WE

02:46:40.223 --> 02:46:43.493
SUGGEST- PERHAPS- REDIRECTING

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:45.161
FUNDS FROM OTHER- PROGRAMS THAT

02:46:45.228 --> 02:46:47.497
ARE LESS WELL TARGETED TOWARDS-

02:46:47.564 --> 02:46:49.399
TOWARDS THIS PROGRAM- IN

02:46:49.466 --> 02:46:50.600
ADDITION- WE THINK THERE'S

02:46:50.667 --> 02:46:51.668
OTHER WAYS THE PROGRAM COULD BE

02:46:51.735 --> 02:46:53.403
EXPANDED. YOU COULD BROADEN THE

02:46:53.470 --> 02:46:55.105
ELIGIBILITY TO OTHER PERIODS

02:46:55.171 --> 02:46:55.872
DURING WHICH BUSINESSES HAD A

02:46:55.939 --> 02:46:57.107
DECLINE IN REVENUE WERE TO

02:46:57.173 --> 02:46:58.675
OTHER INDUSTRIES WERE AFFECTED.

02:46:58.742 --> 02:47:00.377
AND YOU COULD ALSO CONSIDER

02:47:00.443 --> 02:47:01.344
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF THE

02:47:01.411 --> 02:47:03.646
CREDIT TO MORE THAN ONE

02:47:03.713 --> 02:47:05.181
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER EMPLOYEE.

02:47:05.248 --> 02:47:06.483
NOW ALL OF THEM ADDRESS THE

02:47:06.549 --> 02:47:08.818
CALIFORNIA KEEPS EXPANSION- AND

02:47:08.885 --> 02:47:10.887
THE- THE NEW CALIFORNIA

02:47:14.224 --> 02:47:15.291

OBJECTIVEOF COMPORT CALIFORNIA

COMPETES TO ATTRACT RETAIN AND

02:47:18.828 --> 02:47:20.430
GROWING BUSINESSES HERE IT IS A

02:47:20.497 --> 02:47:22.599
TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM. IT IS

02:47:22.665 --> 02:47:24.434
NOT SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO

02:47:24.501 --> 02:47:25.101
PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO

02:47:25.168 --> 02:47:27.771
COMPANIES- THAT WERE AFFECTED

02:47:27.837 --> 02:47:29.873
BY THE PANDEMIC AND- WHEN YOU

02:47:29.939 --> 02:47:30.740
LOOK AT THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES

02:47:30.807 --> 02:47:32.675
THAT HAVE. RECEIVED CALIFORNIA

02:47:32.742 --> 02:47:34.577
COMPETES AWARDS THERE PRIMARILY

02:47:34.644 --> 02:47:35.879
IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS

02:47:35.945 --> 02:47:37.614
MANUFACTURING. PROFESSIONAL

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:39.682
SCIENTIFIC SERVICES AND

02:47:39.749 --> 02:47:40.950
FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES

02:47:41.017 --> 02:47:42.719
AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE

02:47:42.786 --> 02:47:44.254
PANDEMIC HAPPENED BROAD

02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:45.555
FINANCIAL EFFECTS ON MANY

02:47:45.622 --> 02:47:46.756
DIFFERENT BUSINESSES BUT WHEN

02:47:46.823 --> 02:47:50.627
YOU LOOK AT THOSE. INDUSTRIES

02:47:50.693 --> 02:47:51.561
THAT HAD THE LARGEST- THE

02:47:51.628 --> 02:47:52.695
LARGEST DECLINES IN REVENUE THE

02:47:52.762 --> 02:47:54.097
LARGEST- DECLINES IN THE

02:47:54.164 --> 02:47:56.266
EMPLOYMENT THOSE WERE NOT IN

02:47:56.332 --> 02:47:57.667
THESE INDUSTRIES IN THESE

02:47:57.734 --> 02:47:58.835
INDUSTRIES IN PARTICULAR THE

02:47:58.902 --> 02:47:59.903
FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY

02:47:59.969 --> 02:48:01.938
PERFORMED VERY WELL DURING THE

02:48:02.005 --> 02:48:03.573
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. SO WE

02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:04.774
RECOMMEND REJECTING THE

02:48:04.841 --> 02:48:06.242
CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROPOSALS

02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:07.677
FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST THIS

02:48:07.744 --> 02:48:08.945
PROGRAM IS NOT A SUITABLE

02:48:09.012 --> 02:48:10.046
VEHICLE FOR ADDRESSING THE

02:48:10.113 --> 02:48:10.847
ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE

02:48:10.914 --> 02:48:12.348
PANDEMIC BECAUSE IT DOESN'T.

02:48:12.415 --> 02:48:14.350
ADDRESS THOSE ARE TARGET THOSE

02:48:14.417 --> 02:48:15.652
HARDEST HIT INDUSTRY. SECOND

02:48:15.718 --> 02:48:16.453
THE TIMING OF ANY OF THE

02:48:16.519 --> 02:48:17.787
POTENTIAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS

02:48:17.854 --> 02:48:18.655
REALLY DOESN'T ADDRESS THE

02:48:18.721 --> 02:48:20.990
URGENCY- THE CURRENT ECONOMIC

02:48:21.057 --> 02:48:22.659
SITUATION REQUIRES BECAUSE IT'S

02:48:22.725 --> 02:48:23.960
PROGRAM INSTRUCTION OVER A FIVE

02:48:24.027 --> 02:48:25.228

GRANT PROPOSAL DOES RESPOND TO

02:48:27.397 --> 02:48:28.264
THIS TIMING ISSUE TO SOME

02:48:28.331 --> 02:48:29.833
EXTENT IT DOES READ OTHER

02:48:29.899 --> 02:48:32.469
IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR THE

02:48:32.535 --> 02:48:33.002
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IN

02:48:33.069 --> 02:48:34.871

02:48:34.938 --> 02:48:36.406
MAKE A SIGNIFICANT SHIPMENTS

AT THIS TIME. AND ALSO SINCE

02:48:39.709 --> 02:48:41.044
THE ARM THE ADMINISTRATION

HOW WILL THE STATE MANAGED

02:48:51.154 --> 02:48:53.690

02:50:57.046 --> 02:51:01.951
INCREASE. THANK YOU MISTER LIKE.

02:51:02.018 --> 02:51:05.521
AT MISTER CHIP. THANK YOU MADAM

02:51:05.588 --> 02:51:08.024
CHAIR- I THINK I WILL PROBABLY

02:51:08.091 --> 02:51:09.726
PROVIDED A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:51:09.792 --> 02:51:11.527
PERSPECTIVE THAN WHAT WAS JUST-

02:51:11.594 --> 02:51:12.962
ARTICULATED BY BUYER GOOD

02:51:13.029 --> 02:51:14.731
COLLEAGUE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

02:51:14.797 --> 02:51:17.500
THE AISLE. SO- I WAS VERY

02:51:17.567 --> 02:51:19.535
EXCITED TO READ ABOUT THE SMALL

02:51:19.602 --> 02:51:21.070
BUSINESS TAX CREDIT SO I SAY

02:51:21.137 --> 02:51:22.472
THAT AS A SOMEONE WHO USED TO

02:51:22.538 --> 02:51:24.107
RUN A SMALL BUSINESS WHO.

02:51:24.173 --> 02:51:25.575
SERVED AS A SMALL BUSINESS

02:51:25.642 --> 02:51:27.977
COMMISSIONER IN MY CITY- I

02:51:28.044 --> 02:51:29.145
THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING ALL

02:51:29.212 --> 02:51:31.147
THAT WE CAN WHEN IT COMES TO

02:51:31.214 --> 02:51:32.982
EXPANDING TAX CREDITS FOR SMALL

02:51:33.049 --> 02:51:35.118
BUSINESSES. THAT BEING SAID I

02:51:35.184 --> 02:51:37.520
HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT AN

02:51:37.587 --> 02:51:38.488
EXPANSION OF THE CAL COMPETES

02:51:38.554 --> 02:51:40.790
PROGRAM. AS IT'S CURRENTLY

02:51:40.857 --> 02:51:42.692
BEING SUGGESTED AND THAT WAS

02:51:42.759 --> 02:51:43.593
EVEN BEFORE I HEARD FROM THE L.

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:45.895
A. L. SO IF I THINK FRANKLY ONE

02:51:45.962 --> 02:51:47.697
OF THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR

02:51:47.764 --> 02:51:49.499
CAL COMPETES. IS THAT A COMPANY

02:51:49.565 --> 02:51:51.367
PROPOSES TO CREATE AT LEAST

02:51:51.434 --> 02:51:53.002
FIVE HUNDRED NEW JOBS. AND WE

02:51:53.069 --> 02:51:55.104
NEED LARGE COMPANIES ABSOLUTELY

02:51:55.171 --> 02:51:57.573
BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- WE

02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:58.841
HAVE SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES

02:51:58.908 --> 02:52:01.210
THAT ARE- ARE ON THE VERGE OF

02:52:01.277 --> 02:52:03.079
EXTENSION AT THIS POINT AND I

02:52:03.146 --> 02:52:04.514
AND I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO

02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:06.883
FOCUS ARE. VERY SCARCE

02:52:06.949 --> 02:52:08.985
RESOURCES ON HELPING THOSE

02:52:09.052 --> 02:52:11.754
PARTICULAR BUSINESSES AND- AS I

02:52:11.821 --> 02:52:12.555
UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSAL

02:52:12.622 --> 02:52:13.856
CORRECTLY DOESN'T SEEM AS IF

02:52:13.923 --> 02:52:15.124
THERE'S A REQUIREMENT TO

02:52:15.191 --> 02:52:17.527
DEMONSTRATE PANDEMIC IMPACT TO

02:52:17.593 --> 02:52:19.328
RECEIVED A CAL COMPETES GRANT.

02:52:19.395 --> 02:52:23.032
AND YOU KNOW I KNOW. MANY OF

02:52:23.099 --> 02:52:24.767
THE LARGE COMPANIES THAT HAVE

02:52:24.834 --> 02:52:27.036
RECEIVED CAL COMPETES- CREDITS

02:52:27.103 --> 02:52:31.007
IN THE PAST- ARE ARE DESERVING-

02:52:31.074 --> 02:52:33.810
BUT- BUT- MANY OF THEM ARE

02:52:33.876 --> 02:52:35.344
ACTUALLY DOING. FINE AT THIS

02:52:35.411 --> 02:52:36.913
MOMENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

02:52:36.979 --> 02:52:38.214
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LITERALLY

02:52:38.281 --> 02:52:39.415
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER

02:52:39.482 --> 02:52:41.350
BUSINESSES THAT ARE. THAT ARE

02:52:41.417 --> 02:52:44.053
IN TROUBLE SO- I HAVE TO SAY

02:52:44.120 --> 02:52:45.421
WHEN I HEARD THE L. A. O.

02:52:45.488 --> 02:52:47.690
PERSPECTIVE I REALLY. FROM Y

02:52:47.757 --> 02:52:49.258
PERSPECTIVE I FEEL LIKE IF

02:52:49.325 --> 02:52:50.426
WE'RE GOING TO SPEND SCARCE

02:52:50.493 --> 02:52:51.894
RESOURCES WE REALLY NEED TO

02:52:51.961 --> 02:52:53.563
FOCUS ON THOSE SMALLER

02:52:53.629 --> 02:52:55.698
BUSINESSES. THAT ARE ARE AT

02:52:55.765 --> 02:52:57.900
RISK. WHICH LEADS ME TO A

02:52:57.967 --> 02:52:59.569
SECOND POINT. YOU KNOW I'M

02:52:59.635 --> 02:53:01.270
CONCERNED THAT WE'RE CREATING

02:53:01.337 --> 02:53:03.005
DIFFERENT GRANT FUNDING POTS

02:53:03.072 --> 02:53:05.274
WE'VE GOT- MAINSTREET TAX

02:53:05.341 --> 02:53:06.709
CREDIT WE'VE GOT CAL COMPETES

02:53:06.776 --> 02:53:08.311
WITH GOT THE CALIFORNIA RELIEF

02:53:08.377 --> 02:53:11.214
GRANTS- IT'S COMPLICATED. IT'S

02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:13.282
NOT SIMPLE- IT'S CREATING AN

02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:15.885
AWFUL LOT OF BUREAUCRACY FOR

02:53:15.952 --> 02:53:17.520
SMALL BUSINESSES TO NAVIGATE.

02:53:17.587 --> 02:53:19.188
SOME BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE THE

02:53:19.255 --> 02:53:21.257
RESOURCES TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

02:53:21.324 --> 02:53:23.326
AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND

02:53:23.392 --> 02:53:25.128
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHY

02:53:25.194 --> 02:53:25.628
THEY FEEL THAT THERE'S A

02:53:25.695 --> 02:53:27.563
NECESSITY TO CREATE ALL OF

02:53:27.630 --> 02:53:28.664
THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:53:28.731 --> 02:53:30.500
PROGRAMS. RATHER THAN TRYING TO

02:53:30.566 --> 02:53:33.136
SIMPLIFY IT INTO A PROGRAM THAT

02:53:33.202 --> 02:53:36.672
IS FOCUSED ON- ON SMALL BIZ

02:53:36.739 --> 02:53:37.774
ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON SMALL

02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:39.609
BUSINESSES. AND BEEN REALLY

02:53:39.675 --> 02:53:41.010
TRYING TO TRY TO KEEP THOSE

BUSINESSES FROM FROM GOING

02:53:41.778 --> 02:53:43.913
UNDER I. WONDERED IF I COULD-

02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:45.715
GET SOME THOUGHTS ON ON WHY WE

02:53:45.782 --> 02:53:47.784
HAVE TO- I THINK AT THIS POINT

02:53:47.850 --> 02:53:48.985
TALK ABOUT AT LEAST THREE

02:53:49.051 --> 02:53:49.786
DIFFERENT TYPES OF THE

02:53:49.852 --> 02:53:51.554
PROGRAM'S. ALLEGEDLY TO HELP

02:53:51.621 --> 02:53:53.256
SMALL BUSINESSES ALTHOUGH AS I

02:53:53.322 --> 02:53:54.123

02:53:55.658 --> 02:53:59.796
THAT- IF THE REQUIREMENT.

02:53:59.862 --> 02:54:01.330
REQUIRES FIVE HUNDRED NEW JOBS.

02:54:01.397 --> 02:54:04.066

SAME PAGE IS HOW THIS WORKS FOR

02:54:11.741 --> 02:54:13.743
THE FIVE JUST TO BE CLEAR THE

02:54:13.810 --> 02:54:16.112
FIVE HUNDRED. EMPLOYEE TEST FOR

02:54:16.179 --> 02:54:18.681
CAL COMPETES. IN ONE OF SEVERAL

02:54:18.748 --> 02:54:20.650

THE CAL COMPLETES PROGRAM BUT-

02:54:46.742 --> 02:54:47.977
THE L. A. U. ANALYSIS OF THE

02:54:48.044 --> 02:54:50.046
PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO CHIEF

02:54:50.112 --> 02:54:51.948
JUSTICE WELL THERE THEY

02:54:52.014 --> 02:54:55.117
SUGGESTED THAT A LOT OF THE A

02:54:55.184 --> 02:54:57.854
LOT OF THE- CREDIT SUISSE GROUP

02:54:57.920 --> 02:54:59.722
GIVEN UNDER CAL COMPETES. WE'RE

GOING TO BUSINESSES THERE WERE

02:55:01.324 --> 02:55:03.092
CENTURY JUST COMPETING AGAINST

02:55:03.159 --> 02:55:04.794
OTHER CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES.

02:55:04.861 --> 02:55:07.129
AND WOULD YOU GIVE ME THE CAL

02:55:07.196 --> 02:55:09.298
COMPETES OF FOCUS IS MONEY ON

02:55:09.365 --> 02:55:12.568
SMALL BUSINESSES THE TEND TO BE

02:55:12.635 --> 02:55:14.036
THOSE BUSINESSES. THAT ARE NOT-

02:55:14.103 --> 02:55:15.638
YOU KNOW. CONSIDERING MOVING

02:55:15.705 --> 02:55:17.940
OUT OF STATE BUT THEY ARE

02:55:18.007 --> 02:55:20.810
THEY'RE JUST. MOVING AND IT

02:55:20.877 --> 02:55:22.845
JUST JUST DECIDING HOW BIG TO

02:55:22.912 --> 02:55:23.412
GROW THEIR FIRM AND THEY'RE

02:55:23.479 --> 02:55:25.114
COMPETING AGAINST OTHER OTHER

02:55:25.181 --> 02:55:27.550
CALIFORNIA'S RESOURCES. SO THE

02:55:27.617 --> 02:55:29.518
DECISION WAS MADE. BY THE

02:55:29.585 --> 02:55:31.153
LEGISLATURE A COUPLE YEARS AGO

02:55:31.220 --> 02:55:33.723
TO. TO REMOVE THAT SMALL

02:55:33.789 --> 02:55:37.159
BUSINESS CARVE OUT SO THAT- SO

02:55:37.226 --> 02:55:42.164
THAT THE E. D. R. HOW COMPETES

02:55:42.231 --> 02:55:45.735
COMMITTEE COULD FOCUS ON THOSE

02:55:45.801 --> 02:55:48.004
JOBS THAT WERE MOST AT RISK OF

02:55:48.070 --> 02:55:50.039
NOT BEING CREATED IN CALIFORNIA

02:55:50.106 --> 02:55:51.407
SO IT'S REALLY AYE AYE I THINK

02:55:51.474 --> 02:55:52.975
YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT

02:55:53.042 --> 02:55:54.877
THAT THIS IS NOT GEARED

02:55:54.944 --> 02:55:55.344
SPECIFICALLY FOR SMALL

02:55:55.411 --> 02:55:56.946
BUSINESSES. BUT IT'S REALLY

02:55:57.013 --> 02:55:59.015
GEARED TOWARDS KEEPING THE

02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:01.517
ECONOMY GOING AND SPEND AND

02:56:01.584 --> 02:56:03.419
STIMULATING ADDITIONAL GROWTH

02:56:03.486 --> 02:56:08.824
IN THE ECONOMY SO- BUT THAT'S

02:56:08.891 --> 02:56:11.928
MY RESPONSE- AND MAYBE MISTER

02:56:11.994 --> 02:56:13.396
DARCY BECAUSE WHO DISAPPOINTED

02:56:13.462 --> 02:56:15.898
BUT I- I WONDER SECOND QUESTION

02:56:15.965 --> 02:56:16.866
ON ON THE DIFFERENT FUNDING

02:56:16.933 --> 02:56:20.536
PARKSIDE. I THINK I WOULD I

02:56:20.603 --> 02:56:23.339
WOULD GO BACK TO- THE D. THE

02:56:23.406 --> 02:56:24.807
PREVIOUS PANEL TALKED ABOUT THE

02:56:24.874 --> 02:56:26.909
SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS THAT IS

02:56:26.976 --> 02:56:28.644
CLEARLY INTENDED TO HELP SMALL

02:56:28.711 --> 02:56:30.913
BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:32.815
THAT THAT ARE AFFECTED.

02:56:32.882 --> 02:56:34.116
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE

02:56:34.183 --> 02:56:36.953
PANDEMIC AND SO BUT THAT IS A

02:56:37.019 --> 02:56:37.653
PART OF THEIR THAT THE FOR CAL

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:41.991
COMPETE. I'M REALLY LOOKING T-

02:56:42.058 --> 02:56:45.461
AT THAT. URGING FIRMS TO CREATE

02:56:45.528 --> 02:56:47.863
JOBS WITH IN CALIFORNIA THAT

02:56:47.930 --> 02:56:48.397
MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN

02:56:48.464 --> 02:56:51.000
CREATED ELSEWHERE. AND I WILL

02:56:51.067 --> 02:56:54.503
HELP YOU. IT IF I CAN SO I

02:56:54.570 --> 02:56:55.838
APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I DO

02:56:55.905 --> 02:56:57.540
THINK YOU HAVE HONESTLY LAID

02:56:57.606 --> 02:56:59.175
OUT WHAT CAL COMPETES IS ABOUT

02:56:59.241 --> 02:57:00.710
WHAT I'M REACTING TO IS THE

02:57:00.776 --> 02:57:02.111
FACT THAT THE JANUARY BUDGET

02:57:02.178 --> 02:57:04.647
SUGGESTED THAT SMALL BUSINESSES

02:57:04.714 --> 02:57:05.381
AND STARTUPS WOULD PARTICULARLY

02:57:05.448 --> 02:57:07.083
BENEFIT. THROUGH THE GRANT

02:57:07.149 --> 02:57:09.118
PROGRAM FOR CAP KEEPS WE'RE

02:57:09.185 --> 02:57:10.886
TALKING ABOUT CAL COMPETES IN

02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:13.189
THE CONTEXT OF SMALL BUSINESS

02:57:13.255 --> 02:57:14.924
TAX RATE OF PROPOSALS LET'S NOT

02:57:14.991 --> 02:57:16.592
HAVE ANY ILLUSION THAT CAL

02:57:16.659 --> 02:57:18.828
COMPETES. IS ABOUT SMALL

02:57:18.894 --> 02:57:20.663
BUSINESSES IT'S NOT IT'S ABOUT

02:57:20.730 --> 02:57:22.531
TRYING TO KEEP. TRYING TO HELP

02:57:22.598 --> 02:57:25.768
LARGE COMPANIES FROM- TO HELP

02:57:25.835 --> 02:57:27.003
THEM BE COMPETITIVE BUT YOU

02:57:27.069 --> 02:57:28.871
KNOW THESE ARE THE CAL COMPETES

02:57:28.938 --> 02:57:30.806
PROGRAM AS YOU WELL KNOW- HAS

02:57:30.873 --> 02:57:33.676
PROVIDED TAX RATES TO TESLA. TO

02:57:33.743 --> 02:57:35.978
NBCUNIVERSAL THIS TO TWO OTHER

02:57:36.045 --> 02:57:38.014
LARGER COMPANIES AND THESE MAY

02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:40.716
BE VALID USES OF SCARCE DOLLARS

02:57:40.783 --> 02:57:42.918
BUT OPTED TO PUT IT IN THE

02:57:42.985 --> 02:57:44.820
CONTEXT OF A DISCUSSION AROUND

02:57:44.887 --> 02:57:45.855
SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDITS I

02:57:45.921 --> 02:57:48.591
THINK IT'S JUST- IT'S JUST NOT

02:57:48.657 --> 02:57:51.827
CORRECT AND SO. IF I WERE

02:57:51.894 --> 02:57:53.429
DRAFTING THIS BUDGET I WOULD

02:57:53.496 --> 02:57:54.997
SUGGEST THAT WE FOCUS ON ACTUAL

02:57:55.064 --> 02:57:56.766
SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT ARE

02:57:56.832 --> 02:57:58.768
EMPLOYING- FOLKS IN OUR

02:57:58.834 --> 02:58:00.236
COMMUNITIES AND I WOULD REALLY

02:58:00.302 --> 02:58:01.737
WHAT WHAT I WOULD LIKE FOR US

02:58:01.804 --> 02:58:04.073
TO THINK ABOUT IS CAN WE FOCUS

02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:05.975
MORE RESOURCES ON OF THOSE

02:58:06.042 --> 02:58:07.676
SECTORS AND CAN WE CONSOLIDATE

02:58:07.743 --> 02:58:10.312
AND SIMPLIFY. THE TAX PROGRAMS

02:58:10.379 --> 02:58:11.547
AND THE GRANT PROGRAM SO IT'S

02:58:11.614 --> 02:58:13.349
JUST EASIER FOR EVERYDAY

03:25:10.831 --> 03:25:12.199
DIFFERENT MECHANISM TO ENSURE

ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROGRAM

03:25:34.822 --> 03:25:37.324
THAT WAS- ENACTED A FEW YEARS

03:25:37.391 --> 03:25:39.794
AGO I THINK IT WAS TWO THOUSAND

03:25:39.860 --> 03:25:40.461
EIGHTEEN FOR APPROXIMATELY

03:25:40.528 --> 03:25:41.762
TWENTY NINE. MILLION DOLLARS

FUNDING WOULD. COME FROM I HOPE.

03:26:04.919 --> 03:26:05.453

FUNDING- IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN

03:26:58.339 --> 03:26:59.707
THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING

VERY QUICKLY. AND FOR EXAMPLE

03:30:24.979 --> 03:30:27.514
LAST APRIL. WHEN THERE WAS A

03:30:27.581 --> 03:30:28.682
IMMEDIATE NEED FOR SMALL

03:30:28.749 --> 03:30:30.751

03:30:30.818 --> 03:30:32.419
ELIGIBLE OR NOT AVAIL

03:30:32.486 --> 03:30:34.355

03:30:36.023 --> 03:30:37.524
QUICKLY GO OUT THE DOOR. THAT

03:30:37.591 --> 03:30:39.760
WOULD ENABLE US TO GET FUNDS TO

03:30:39.827 --> 03:30:41.729
THOSE MICRO SMALL BUSINESSES.

03:30:41.795 --> 03:30:43.597

OF DAYS OR DIMANCHE. COBIT

03:30:46.333 --> 03:30:47.968
NINETEEN INITIATIVE. WITHIN OUR

03:30:48.035 --> 03:30:49.370
DISASTER PROGRAM WE HAVE LET

03:30:49.436 --> 03:30:50.938
YOU WITH AND THAT'S CORRECT. TO

03:30:51.005 --> 03:30:53.774
DO SO. AND SO THIS TIME AROUND.

03:30:53.841 --> 03:30:56.710
WAITER WHEN WE- ENTER THE

03:30:56.777 --> 03:30:58.412
CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUNDS.

03:30:58.479 --> 03:31:00.214
THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND

03:31:00.280 --> 03:31:01.615
LAUNCHING THE MEMBER TWENTIETH.

03:31:01.682 --> 03:31:03.917
AND IT'S STILL EARLY IN ITS

03:31:03.984 --> 03:31:11.425
INCEPTION. IT'S NOT ABOUT. TEN

03:31:11.492 --> 03:31:11.992
MILLION DOLLARS OF LOANS TO

03:31:12.059 --> 03:31:12.860
DATE. IT'S GONNA CONTINUE TO. A

03:31:12.926 --> 03:31:14.128
SUCH MY OF CAPITAL. THE FIRST

03:31:14.194 --> 03:31:16.063
REASON IT FALTERED IN THAT PATH-

03:31:16.130 --> 03:31:17.865
WE WOULD WATCH BE ABLE TO. THE

03:31:17.931 --> 03:31:19.900
ABILITY TO DIRECT THOSE FUNDS

03:31:19.967 --> 03:31:21.402
PERHAPS YOU'RE ALONE OKAY I

03:31:21.468 --> 03:31:23.470
THINK INITIATIVE PERHAPS TO

03:31:23.537 --> 03:31:25.239
OTHER INITIATIVES ALSO THE

03:31:25.305 --> 03:31:29.643
CALIFORNIA BUILDING ON. IS AT A

03:31:29.710 --> 03:31:31.612
CUT BY MARKET CONDITIONS AND

03:31:31.678 --> 03:31:33.547
CAN. OTHER VEHICLES WERE THEIR

03:31:33.614 --> 03:31:34.515
UMBRELLA RIGHT NOW THEY

03:31:34.581 --> 03:31:36.083
ACTUALLY HAVE TWO VEHICLES BOTH

03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:37.684
OF WHICH WOULD PARTICIPATE IN.

03:31:37.751 --> 03:31:38.719
ONE LEVERAGES OUR LOAN

03:31:38.786 --> 03:31:40.754
GUARANTEES THE OTHER LEVERAGES

03:31:40.821 --> 03:31:41.588
THE FIRST LOSS INVESTMENT FROM

03:31:41.655 --> 03:31:44.124
THE IPAD. AND SO IF THERE WERE

03:31:44.191 --> 03:31:46.093
TO BE A NEED FOR A DIFFERENT

03:31:46.160 --> 03:31:48.829
TYPE. OF INSTRUMENT TO ADDRESS

03:31:48.896 --> 03:31:50.764
THE MARKETPLACE NEEDS WE WANT

03:31:50.831 --> 03:31:53.067
TO BE ABLE TO DO SO ALL WITH A

03:31:53.133 --> 03:31:54.968
GREAT GRAND MISSION OF SERVING

03:31:55.035 --> 03:31:56.036
THE BUS UNDERSERVED THE SMALL

03:31:56.103 --> 03:31:58.205
THE SMALL BUSINESSES. AND SO

03:31:58.272 --> 03:31:59.940
WE'VE DONE THAT IN OCTOBER

03:32:00.007 --> 03:32:02.543
NINETEEN PROGRAM WHERE 85% OF

03:32:02.609 --> 03:32:04.845
THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN

03:32:04.912 --> 03:32:06.713
BUILT THEMSELVES A BAR CODED. A

03:32:06.780 --> 03:32:09.716
MICRO LOAN GUARANTEES- ARE

03:32:09.783 --> 03:32:11.485
EITHER A FEMALE OR- MINORITY

03:32:11.552 --> 03:32:14.455
OWNED OR ARE LOCATED IN BLOW TO

03:32:14.521 --> 03:32:17.257
MODERATE. OF SEVERAL OF THE

03:32:17.324 --> 03:32:18.992
CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND IS

03:32:19.059 --> 03:32:21.028
TARGETING THE SAME CONSTITUENCY

03:32:21.095 --> 03:32:22.362
USING MANY OF THE SAME PARTNERS

03:32:22.429 --> 03:32:23.797
THAT THAT WE USE FOR OUR

03:32:23.864 --> 03:32:25.699
GUARANTEE PROGRAM. AND THEIR

03:32:25.766 --> 03:32:31.405
STAFFS ARE VERY SIMILAR. I

03:32:31.472 --> 03:32:32.339
BELIEVE THEY ARE ASKED- 84% SO

03:32:32.406 --> 03:32:34.608
WE'RE- SPOT ON TERMS OF UNDER A-

03:32:34.675 --> 03:32:36.076
POPULATION. THAT WERE TRYING TO

03:32:36.143 --> 03:32:38.712
TARGET. AND SO THAT WILL REMAIN

03:32:38.779 --> 03:32:41.248
THE SAME THE FINANCIAL TOOL AN

03:32:41.315 --> 03:32:43.650
INSTRUMENT TO APPLY TO REACH

03:32:43.717 --> 03:32:46.286

MORE SENIOR CAPITAL. AND

03:33:48.448 --> 03:33:50.384
