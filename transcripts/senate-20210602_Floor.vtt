GROUNDS IT'S ACTUALLY THE CASE.

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:56.996
THAT THE REAL PROBLEMS IN THIS

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:57.830

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:09.775
IMPORTANT TO US THAT THAT THERE

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:11.243
NOT BE ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS AS

HAVE THAT ACCESS- AND YET WE

00:26:56.381 --> 00:26:59.851
SEE CONCERTED EFFORTS TO TRY TO

DISSUADE PEOPLE FROM TAKING THE

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:02.721

AMERICA- AND WE WILL HAVE

VACCINATION. THANK YOU CENTER

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:40.291
GORGEOUS- I THINK. WHEN YOU

HAVE PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTION AND

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:44.195
INTIMIDATION THAT CANNOT BE

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:48.033
TOLERATED- FOR A VARIETY OF

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:50.201
REASONS OBVIOUSLY MOST OBVIOUS

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:53.104
IS YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE FOLKS-

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:55.006
TO GET VACCINATED BY MYSELF

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:56.975

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:50.762
THE AUTHOR THAT. PHYSICAL

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:53.064
OBSTRUCTION INTIMIDATION CAN

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:56.134
NEVER BE TOLERATED AND

00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:56.734
ESPECIALLY IN A SITUATION LIKE

00:28:56.801 --> 00:29:01.372
THIS. MY CONCERN IS ON-

00:29:01.439 --> 00:29:07.245

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:08.813

APPROPRIATE. BUT PICKETING IS

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:27.665
NOT INTIMIDATION. IN PICKETING

00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:31.569
IS NOT- PHYSICALLY OBSTRUCTIVE

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:33.671

THEY PURCHASED THIS PROPERTY IN

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:31.975
NINETEEN TWELVE. FOR TWELVE

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:34.244
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS.

CONSTANTLY AND IN NINETEEN

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:40.183

SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:53.630

TULSA THEY USE EMINENT DOMAIN

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:03.106
AFTER BURNING DOWN THAT TOWN.

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:05.008
TO PREVENT THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:07.010
FROM REBUILDING. THEY TOOK THIS

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.645
PROPERTY IN TWO THOUSAND I MEAN

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:11.448
NINETEEN. TWENTY FOUR. AND

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:27.464
FIVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.299
DEEDED THE LAND TO THE COUNTY

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.368
OF LOS ANGELES.AND FROM THERE

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:34.204
THEY BUILT. A LIFEGUARD

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:39.075
TRAINING SESSION THE US STATION.

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:41.077
THIS BILL SIMPLY BEGINS THE

00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:44.280
TRANSFER OF RETURNING THIS

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:46.549

RIGHT THING AND HELP CORRECT

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:02.632
THIS HORRIBLE WRONG THAT

00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:04.768
HAPPENED HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:06.269
WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS BILL THE

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:08.471
PEOPLE OUT WAS IT UNIQUE AND AS

00:55:08.538 --> 00:55:10.140
WE'VE SEEN THIS IS NOT UNIQUE

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:11.808
THERE'S HUNDREDS IF NOT

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:13.877
THOUSANDS OF STORIES LIKE THIS

00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:15.512
THIS IS JUST ONE WORD IT'S

00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:18.548
STILL. THIS LAND OTHER THAN THE

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.950
LIFEGUARD STATION STILL SITS AS

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:23.920
IT WAS IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:26.022
WHEN THEY RAISE THE FACILITIES

00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:28.558
FROM THEIR PROPERTY. THIS BILL

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:32.095
WILL NOT PROVIDE JUSTICE. BUT

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:36.633
IT IS A SMALL MEASURE TO RETURN

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.600
AND RECOGNIZE THE WRONG THAT

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.736
THIS FAMILY WE ELIMINATED

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:42.672
GENERATIONAL WEALTH. FROM THIS

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:45.208
FAMILY AND THE SURROUNDING

FOLKS WHO LIVED ON THIS LAND.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.245
THIS BILL IS A MODEL WHAT

00:55:49.312 --> 00:55:51.514
ECONOMIC JUSTICE SHOULD LOOK

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:54.184
LIKE IN THIS COUNTRY THIS BILL

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.286
WILL NOT A RACE AS I STATED

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:57.854
BOTH HORRIBLE ACTS BUT IT

00:55:57.921 --> 00:55:58.755
REPRESENTS A RESTORATIVE

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:00.924
JUSTICE AND A CLEAR STEP IN THE

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.925
RIGHT DIRECTION AND I

FORWARD. AND IT'S A VERY VERY

00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:24.514
IMPORTANT ACT AND I WONDER HOW

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:27.350
MANY MORE WE KNOW. THAT THERE

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:29.119
WERE MANY MORE INCIDENCES

00:56:29.185 --> 00:56:33.723
PERHAPS NOT AS- AS OBVIOUS AS

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:36.059
BRUCE'S BEACH BUT WE KNOW THERE

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:37.327
WERE MANY OTHER INCIDENCES

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:44.968
WHERE. AFRICAN AMERICANS. MRS

00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:46.302
WERE TAKEN OR THEY WERE DRIVEN

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:49.172
OUT. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:51.975
INSTANCE WE WILL NEVER KNOW THE

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:54.944
EXTENT OF GENERATIONAL WEALTH

00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:56.913
THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM THE

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.349
LONG TERM OPERATION OF BRIDGET

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:01.484
BRUCE'S SPEECH NOT ONLY FOR THE

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:03.453
BRUCE FAMILY BUT FOR ALL THEIR

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.089
EMPLOYEES ALL OF WHOM OF COURSE

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:08.091
NO LONGER HAD JOBS ONCE

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:10.393
MANHATTAN BEACH. TOOK THE

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.995
PROPERTY. AND WHEN WE THINK

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:16.166
ABOUT. D. THE DIFFERENCE

00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:18.067
BETWEEN THE WEALTH OF AN

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:19.435
AVERAGE AFRICAN AMERICANS IN

00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:21.771
OUR COUNTRY AND THE WEALTH OF

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:23.273
AN AVERAGE WHITE PERSON. YOU

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.108
KNOW WHY DO MANY OF US HAVE

00:57:25.175 --> 00:57:26.576
THAT WEALTH AND I'M TALKING NOW

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:27.911
ABOUT MYSELF AS A WHITE PERSON

00:57:27.977 --> 00:57:29.646
WE HAPPENED BECAUSE OUR

00:57:29.712 --> 00:57:31.748
FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO RETAIN

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:33.817
THEIR BUSINESSES RETAIN THEIR

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:35.618
PROPERTIES OWNED THEIR HOMES.

00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:37.086
AND THOSE THINGS INCREASED IN

00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:39.889
VALUE AND FOR ME FOR EXAMPLE I

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:41.591
WAS ABLE TO PUT MY DAUGHTER

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:42.659
THROUGH COLLEGE PART REFINE MY

00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:46.029
HOUSE. IF I HAD BEEN UNABLE TO

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:48.932
OWN A HOUSE AND WE KNOW THAT

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:49.732
KEEPS YOU KNOW NOT THATMANY

00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:52.569
YEARS AGO WITH COVENANTS AND

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:55.638
REDLINING AND OTHER PRACTICES.

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:56.472
A BLACK FAMILY COULDN'T OWN THE

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:58.575
HOUSE THEN OF COURSE THAT

00:57:58.641 --> 00:57:59.909
COMPLETELY IMPACTED THEIR

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:01.845
GENERATIONAL WEALTH I WAS

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:04.414
STRUCK WELL I HAD KNOWN ABOUT

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.283
THE TULSA MASSACRE. I WAS

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.052
STRUCK IN THE REAR WITH

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:10.820
RECENTLY WITH THE AMOUNT OF

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.555
MEDIA ATTENTION THE SIXTY

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:15.825
MINUTES- SPECIAL ON IT AND THEN

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:17.393
MY OWN CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA

AND HOW IT WAS COMPLETELY

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:27.403
BURIED FROM THE PUBLIC AND THAT

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:30.707
EVEN BLACK RESIDENTS OF TULSA

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.508
DID NOT KNOW THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

00:58:32.575 --> 00:58:34.444

ANTHONY BRUCE- THROUGH THE

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.442
ACTIONS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN BY

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:14.210
THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES'S

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.679
MANAGER- HERE TODAY REMOVES

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.314
THOSE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:19.215
PLACE ON THE PROPERTY BACK IN

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.250
NINETEEN. NINETY FIVE WHEN WE

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.752
NEEDED IT TO THE COUNTER. AND

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.687
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR FOR MY OWN

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.122
EDIFICATION THAT MEANS THAT THE

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:29.192
COUNTY'S ULTIMATELY MAKING

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:29.659
DECISION NOT THE STATE

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:30.393
LEGISLATURE. WE'RE THOSE

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.527
RESTRICTIONS SO THE COUNTY CAN

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.563

FAMILY. I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.066
THAT AND THEN I HAVE ONE OTHER

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.268
QUESTION WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WE

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:41.237
ARE ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.905
PUBLIC ACCESS TO OUR BEACHES

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.007
AND COASTLINES AND I ASSUME

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:45.008
THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.342
MEASURES TAKEN BY THE LA.

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:48.411
COUNTY TO ENSURE THAT- THE

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.646
TRANSFER OF THIS WHOLE- NOT

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:52.215
DIMINISH PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:54.350
ACCESS THE BEACH. I WOULD HOPE

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.952
NO MORE THAN THEY DIMINISH THE

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:57.520
BRUCE'S FAMILY FROM ACCESSING

THEY OWN FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:03.626

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:05.595

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:06.763

MY FAMILY MANY OF YOU KNOW

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.726
HOMESTEADED HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.628
AND EMINENT DOMAIN IS SOMETHING

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:42.065
THAT IS- USED AS A TOOL FOR THE

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:43.599
GOOD OF THE PUBLIC THAT'S WHAT

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.034
WE'RE RESPONSIBLE BUILD ROADS

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:49.505
GOOD FOR ALL THE PUBLIC. IN

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:51.074
THIS CASE IT WASN'T GOOD FOR

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.176
ALL THE PUBLIC IT WAS GOOD FOR

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:57.313
AN OPPORTUNITY TO. MUNA GENDER.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.781

VERY DIFFICULT TO. FIX THOSE

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:14.297
WRONGS BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:16.065
HAVE HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.801

TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.095

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:20.634

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:25.606
LEAKS FOR MANY MONTHS- MY OWN

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:26.974
PERSONAL VIEW IS IF THAT WAS

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:28.876
NECESSARY TO GAS THAT CAUSE

01:37:28.943 --> 01:37:30.611
PEOPLE BEING ILL. BUT IT WOULD

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.346

AND WHEN IT WAS FIRST. BUILT

01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:49.897
THERE'S NOTHING AROUND IT NOW

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:51.565
IT'S SURROUNDED BY HOMES IS

01:37:51.632 --> 01:37:53.500
SURROUNDED BY A CHARTER SCHOOL.

01:37:53.567 --> 01:37:56.537

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:01.575
PRUDENT MEASURE TO INFORM THEM

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:03.510

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:04.645

CAUTIOUS SUPPORTED THIS BILL- I

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:16.924
BELIEVE THAT TRANSPARENCY IS

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:18.459
VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WITH

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:19.827
COMES FROM THE OIL AND GAS

01:38:19.893 --> 01:38:21.295
INDUSTRY IN TRANSPARENCY

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:23.464
SPECIFICALLY IN KERN COUNTY

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:25.032
WHERE WE HAVE 70% OF THE

01:38:25.099 --> 01:38:27.234
STATE'S OIL- THAT IS CONSUMED

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:29.103
BY ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:31.005
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:32.506
THINK THAT TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD

01:38:32.573 --> 01:38:34.141
AND WE REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:36.043
HIDE I APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:38.178
FROM FREMONT A FEW YEARS AGO

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:39.613
THE TRANSPARENCY BILL ON

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.182
FRACKING AND- DATA DATA THAT

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:43.617
HAS BEEN COLLECTED SHOWS THAT

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:46.086
IT IS DONE VERY SAFELY AND IT

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:48.255
IS- PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:49.356
AND IT IS ONE OF THE SAFEST

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:50.924
PROCEDURES ESPECIALLY THE WAY

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:52.026
THAT WE OPERATE IN THE

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:53.560
REGULATORY CLIMATE IN THE STATE

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:55.562
OF CALIFORNIA SO I THINK DATA

01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:57.598
IS GOOD AND TRANSPARENCY IS

01:38:57.665 --> 01:39:00.834
GOOD- I THINK THE BEAST THAT

01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:01.602
PEOPLE HAVE WITH THIS

01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:03.203
PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.405
IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE FUNDED

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:05.906
AGAIN BY INDUSTRY. WHERE THE

01:39:05.973 --> 01:39:07.841

TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD I JUST

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:21.889
THINK THAT AS WE- REQUEST WE

01:39:21.955 --> 01:39:24.425
REQUEST STUFF TO BE DONE TO

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:25.459

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:27.227
REQUEST AS LEGISLATORS FOR

01:39:27.294 --> 01:39:28.629
OTHER ITEMS SO THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:39:28.696 --> 01:39:30.831

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:32.766
THINK OF A SCRIPTURE JOSE FOR

SIX IS MY PEOPLE PERISH FOR

01:39:33.734 --> 01:39:34.935

MAKING SURE THESE FACILITIES

03:08:42.377 --> 03:08:45.347
HAVE LAND TO OPERATE IN. AND MY

03:08:45.414 --> 03:08:47.482
CONCERN IS THE INTENT OF THE

03:08:47.549 --> 03:08:48.650

THE TAX REVENUE SHOULD GO TO.

03:09:02.130 --> 03:09:02.831
LOS ANGELES COUNTY OR SOME

03:09:02.898 --> 03:09:04.966
OTHER COUNTY. THE CONCERN I

03:09:06.234 --> 03:09:07.536
KERN COUNTY BEING SUCH A LARGE

03:09:07.602 --> 03:09:09.304
LAND MASS AREA WHERE WE HAVE

03:09:09.371 --> 03:09:12.007

03:09:22.651 --> 03:09:23.785
CLIMATE GOALS THE STATUS PUT

03:09:23.852 --> 03:09:25.387
FORTH IN KERN COUNTY BUT WE GET

03:09:25.454 --> 03:09:27.689
NO TAX BENEFIT FROM IT. SO WE

03:09:27.756 --> 03:09:29.124
CAN'T HIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:09:29.191 --> 03:09:30.525
FIXER LIBRARY STICKS ARE

03:09:30.592 --> 03:09:32.127
SWIMMING POOLS. DO THE WATER

BECAUSE WE DON'T COLLECT TAX

03:09:34.896 --> 03:09:36.465

WHERE THESE FACILITIES ARE AT.

03:09:45.674 --> 03:09:47.109
AND I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL

BILL- IS THE INTENT TO LEAD TO

03:10:03.258 --> 03:10:04.292

GOING TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD BUT

03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:20.609
I'M GLAD WE ARE SO MOST OF

03:10:20.675 --> 03:10:21.810
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TODAY

03:10:21.877 --> 03:10:23.812

CENTER AND I UNDERSTAND THE

03:10:29.417 --> 03:10:30.352
IMPACTS COMING ON A LOCAL

03:10:30.418 --> 03:10:32.354
GOVERNMENT WHEN WE FOUGHT OVER

03:10:32.420 --> 03:10:35.290
SALES TAX. ON EVERY TURN WITH

03:10:35.357 --> 03:10:35.791
BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE

03:10:35.857 --> 03:10:38.393
COUNTY'S. WHEN WE COME FROM A

03:10:38.460 --> 03:10:40.462
DISTRICT WHERE YOU HAVE VERY

03:10:40.529 --> 03:10:42.264
WIDE OPEN SPACES AND VERY FEW

03:10:42.330 --> 03:10:43.131
PEOPLE IN MOST PARTS OF MY

03:10:43.198 --> 03:10:45.667
DISTRICT- ONE OF THE THINGS

03:10:45.734 --> 03:10:47.669
THAT MY COMMUNITIES SURVIVE ON

03:10:47.736 --> 03:10:49.204
A SALES TAX AND THEN. WE'VE

03:10:49.271 --> 03:10:51.540
SEEN A TREND NOW WE HAVE THE

03:10:51.606 --> 03:10:53.008
AMAZONS OF THE WORLD AND WE

03:10:53.074 --> 03:10:55.143
HAVE THE COSCO'S AND WE HAVE

03:10:55.210 --> 03:10:58.446
THESE. THE ABILITY TO.

03:10:58.513 --> 03:11:00.015
DISTRIBUTE OW WHERE WE DIDN'T

03:11:00.081 --> 03:11:02.250
HAVE BEFORE WE USED TO GO TO

03:11:02.317 --> 03:11:04.219
THAT STORE BY THE ITEMS THAT

03:11:04.286 --> 03:11:06.588
WERE THERE THE SALES TAX WAS

03:11:06.655 --> 03:11:08.223
COLLECTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

03:11:08.290 --> 03:11:10.325
AND THAT HELP PROVIDE SERVICES

03:11:10.392 --> 03:11:12.327
FOR THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES

03:11:12.394 --> 03:11:14.129
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR STREETS

03:11:14.196 --> 03:11:16.264
FOR. ALL THE THINGS THAT THAT

03:11:16.331 --> 03:11:19.568
THEY PROVIDE. AND NOW WE SEE

03:11:19.634 --> 03:11:21.303
THESE BIG DISTRIBUTION CENTERS

03:11:21.369 --> 03:11:24.139
LIKE AMAZON AND THE OTHERS THAT

03:11:24.206 --> 03:11:25.407
ARE LOCATED IN ONE AREA THAT

03:11:25.473 --> 03:11:27.709
SELLS TAX GOES TO THAT ONE AREA

03:11:27.776 --> 03:11:28.677
SO MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR

03:11:28.743 --> 03:11:32.714
IS- WILL THIS STUDY. TAKING A

03:11:32.781 --> 03:11:35.617
COW SOME OF THOSE LOST REVENUES

03:11:35.684 --> 03:11:39.054
FROM THE TRENDS OF CHANGING TO.

03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:40.255
THE DISTRIBUTION WAY THAT WE'RE

03:11:40.322 --> 03:11:47.062
DOING BUSINESS. CENTERED

03:11:47.128 --> 03:11:49.364
LARGELY STREET. ADDRESS OF

03:11:49.431 --> 03:11:50.532
COURSE ANYONE YET IN YOUR

03:11:50.599 --> 03:11:52.567
CLOTHES WELL I JUST LIKE TO

03:11:52.634 --> 03:11:53.602
HEAR IT A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY

03:11:53.668 --> 03:11:55.470
AGAIN IF I COULD FROM THE GOOD

03:11:55.537 --> 03:11:59.641
SENATOR MY QUESTION IS THAT

03:11:59.708 --> 03:12:00.342
YOU'RE- YOU'RE TRYING TO.

03:12:00.408 --> 03:12:02.677
RETAIN DATA AND MOST OF HOWEVER

03:12:02.744 --> 03:12:06.014
TODAY'S PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT.

03:12:06.081 --> 03:12:07.249
WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE FOR

03:12:07.315 --> 03:12:09.918
THEIR COMMUNITY FOR THEIR BIG

03:12:09.985 --> 03:12:12.053
FOR THEIR DISTRIBUTION CENTER.

03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:14.322
BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:15.757
SALES TAX HAS BEEN LOST TO

03:12:15.824 --> 03:12:17.058
THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY

03:12:17.125 --> 03:12:19.060
HAD A STORY FOR THE MERCHANDISE

03:12:19.127 --> 03:12:20.829
WAS WAS GOING TO THE STORE YOU

03:12:20.896 --> 03:12:22.364
COLLECT THE TAX AT THE STORE

03:12:22.430 --> 03:12:24.633
AND THAT HELP SUPPORT. THE SALT

03:12:24.699 --> 03:12:26.735
SMALL GREASE IS THAT INCLUDED

03:12:26.801 --> 03:12:28.503
IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

03:12:28.570 --> 03:12:30.438
THE FOCUS THANK YOU GET A GOOD

03:12:30.505 --> 03:12:32.140
SENATOR THE FOCUS ON THIS BILL

03:12:32.207 --> 03:12:34.876
IS- AT THE YOU KNOW WE COLLECT

03:12:34.943 --> 03:12:36.811
THE SALES TAX DATA. BUT IT'S

03:12:36.878 --> 03:12:38.980
NOT COLLATED IT'S NOT SEGMENTED

03:12:39.047 --> 03:12:39.948
IN A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN

03:12:40.015 --> 03:12:41.683
UNDERSTAND. HOW THE BRADLEY

03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:44.886
BURNS TAX. AFFECTS WHERE WHERE

03:12:44.953 --> 03:12:47.355
THE MONEY IS END UP GOING. ON

03:12:47.422 --> 03:12:49.024
VERSES WHERE THE PEOPLE HAVE

03:12:49.090 --> 03:12:50.725
MADE THE ORDERS FROM SELF I

03:12:50.792 --> 03:12:51.726
THINK IT WILL AND WHAT I THINK

03:12:51.793 --> 03:12:53.028
IT WILL TO SOME DEGREE WILL

03:12:53.094 --> 03:12:53.862
ENLIGHTEN THE QUESTION THAT

03:12:53.929 --> 03:12:56.064
YOU'RE ASKING- I CAN'T BE

03:12:56.131 --> 03:12:58.199
EXACTLY SURE THAT IT WILL BUT-

03:12:58.266 --> 03:12:59.567
IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO TAKE THAT

03:12:59.634 --> 03:13:00.969
EXISTING TAX DATA THAT WE

03:13:01.036 --> 03:13:03.505
COLLECT. AND MAKING SURE WE

03:13:03.571 --> 03:13:04.572
CANNOT IDENTIFY THE CITY IN

03:13:04.639 --> 03:13:08.243
WHICH- THE FOLKS- ORDERED IT.

03:13:08.310 --> 03:13:09.878
FOR COLLECTED IT. AND SO THAT'S

03:13:09.945 --> 03:13:10.946
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DISCERN

03:13:11.012 --> 03:13:12.180
THE BILL AGAIN IT DOESN'T

03:13:12.247 --> 03:13:13.815
AFFECT ANY OF THE ANY EXISTING.

03:13:13.882 --> 03:13:15.750
AGREEMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE.

03:13:15.817 --> 03:13:16.685
BUT IT IS TRYING TO CREATE

03:13:16.751 --> 03:13:19.754
GREATER TRANSPARENCY ON THAT-

03:13:19.821 --> 03:13:21.957
TAX. CONSEQUENCES TO THE

03:13:22.023 --> 03:13:25.794
BENEFIT. OR DISADVANTAGE OF

03:13:25.860 --> 03:13:28.663
THAT OF ALL OF US. THANK YOU

03:13:28.730 --> 03:13:30.966
ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR

03:13:31.032 --> 03:13:33.601
DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. IN

03:13:33.668 --> 03:13:35.136
ADDITION THE SCRIPTURAL GREAT

03:13:35.203 --> 03:13:37.739
SCENE NINE- GLACIER WHICH A LOT

CLOSER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT

YOU KNOW I LOVE THE SPIRITED

03:13:41.543 --> 03:13:43.111
DEBATE IN THIS SUBJECT AREA AND

03:13:43.178 --> 03:13:45.280
THIS IS MY- THIRD TIME WITH

03:13:45.347 --> 03:13:46.614
ENGAGING IN IT AS AN AUTHOR OF

03:13:46.681 --> 03:13:48.149
A BILL THAT TOUCH A TOUCH THIS

03:13:48.216 --> 03:13:50.618
AREA AND IT'S A IT TOUCHES IT

03:13:50.685 --> 03:13:52.520
IT'S A SENSITIVE POINT BECAUSE-

03:13:52.587 --> 03:13:54.689
WHAT'S BECOME CLEAR WITHOUT

03:13:54.756 --> 03:13:56.858
REAL DATA TO RELY UPON IT CLEAR

03:13:56.925 --> 03:13:57.959
TO ME AT LEAST IS THAT THERE

03:13:58.026 --> 03:13:59.761
HAVE BEEN WINNERS AND LOSERS.

03:13:59.828 --> 03:14:01.730
IN THE TAX GAMES CALLED BRADLEY

03:14:01.796 --> 03:14:03.064
BURNS AND WHERE IT'S DESIGNATED

03:14:03.131 --> 03:14:06.668
AS COLLECTED AND- AND IT'S

03:14:06.735 --> 03:14:07.969
ALLOWED SOME OF THE BIGGEST

03:14:08.036 --> 03:14:09.804
CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD TO

03:14:09.871 --> 03:14:12.841
MANIPULATE OUR TAX CODE NOW WE

03:14:12.907 --> 03:14:14.743
MAY DISAGREE OR AGREE ABOUT THE

03:14:14.809 --> 03:14:16.745
EFFECT OF THAT. AND WE'VE HAD

03:14:16.811 --> 03:14:18.079
SOME SPIRITED DEBATES FROM MY

03:14:18.146 --> 03:14:19.848
COLLEAGUES ABOUT THOSE WHO FEEL

03:14:19.914 --> 03:14:21.016
THAT THAT THOSE THOSE

03:14:21.082 --> 03:14:21.883
ARRANGEMENTS WORK TO THEIR

03:14:21.950 --> 03:14:23.585
ADVANTAGE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN

03:14:23.651 --> 03:14:25.720
WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND SO I'M

03:14:25.787 --> 03:14:26.921
ASKING IN THIS BILL BY THE WAY

03:14:26.988 --> 03:14:28.990
IS POLICE HAVE THE DATA SO WE

03:14:29.057 --> 03:14:29.858
CAN HAVE A MORE THOROUGH

03:14:29.924 --> 03:14:31.459
CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD IF

03:14:31.526 --> 03:14:34.796
THERE'S ANY PROPOSAL. TO CHANGE

03:14:34.863 --> 03:14:35.663
IT. I WANT TO KNOW ONE LAST

03:14:35.730 --> 03:14:38.767
THING WHICH IS THAT. WHEN

03:14:38.833 --> 03:14:39.300
COMMUNITIES NEGOTIATE WITH

03:14:39.367 --> 03:14:41.803
THESE COMPANIES. THEY'RE NOT

03:14:41.870 --> 03:14:44.472
NEGOTIATING WITH THEIR MONEY.

03:14:44.539 --> 03:14:46.141
THEY'RE ENGAGING WITH OUR MONEY

03:14:46.207 --> 03:14:47.876
THE PUBLIC'S MONEY AND WHEN

03:14:47.942 --> 03:14:49.511
THEY AGREED TO GIVE MONEY BACK

03:14:49.577 --> 03:14:51.079
TO THESE CORPORATIONS THAT

03:14:51.146 --> 03:14:53.081
THEY'RE GIVING BACK OUR MONEY.

03:14:53.148 --> 03:14:54.315

OUR NEEDS- IS SO STRONG. IN A

03:26:42.923 --> 03:26:45.292
PERFECT WORLD I BELIEVE THAT

03:26:45.359 --> 03:26:46.761
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE INVESTED

03:26:46.827 --> 03:26:49.163
IS USING ITS ONETIME UNEXPECTED

03:26:49.230 --> 03:26:52.399

BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE- I

03:26:55.536 --> 03:26:57.104
DON'T THINK IT'S VERY OFTEN

03:26:57.171 --> 03:26:59.974
THEN WE HAVE A SURPLUS WE CALL

03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:02.676
IT THAT OF THIS NATURE. AND

03:27:02.743 --> 03:27:03.644
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE

03:27:03.711 --> 03:27:07.014
PANDEMIC IS THE INEQUITY AND

03:27:07.081 --> 03:27:08.682
THE TECH DIVIDE ACROSS THE

TO SCHOOL GO TO CLASS- IN THE

03:27:18.959 --> 03:27:20.961
DISTANCE- FORMAT BECAUSE OF THE

US HAVE SOME EXAMPLE OF THIS.

03:27:25.366 --> 03:27:27.368
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE

03:27:27.434 --> 03:27:29.303
SHOULD BE USING THE FUNDING

03:27:29.370 --> 03:27:31.906

THESE FUNDS AS WELL SO THIS

03:29:47.474 --> 03:29:49.243
CREATES A MORE EQUITABLE

03:29:49.310 --> 03:29:51.111
PROCESS I THINK IN AND- YOUR%

03:29:51.178 --> 03:29:52.379
POINT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

THEY EXIST IN CENTRAL VALLEY

03:30:01.088 --> 03:30:03.290
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE SIX ONE

03:30:03.357 --> 03:30:04.758
SPEEDS WE NEED TO BE AT LEAST

03:30:04.825 --> 03:30:05.859
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT THIS

03:30:05.926 --> 03:30:07.995
IS ASKING. FOR EVEN MORE AND

03:30:08.062 --> 03:30:09.763
IT'S A BIPARTISAN DISCUSSION IN

03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:11.065
THE FEDERAL AT THE FEDERAL

03:30:11.131 --> 03:30:14.234

03:30:57.311 --> 03:30:59.046
CREATE A PROBLEM BUT IT SURE

03:30:59.113 --> 03:31:01.782
DID EXPOSE. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

03:31:01.849 --> 03:31:03.484

BECAUSE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

03:31:12.159 --> 03:31:14.828

SCENARIO WITH YOU. EIGHTEEN T.

HAS A LINE THAT GOES ALL THE

03:31:44.925 --> 03:31:47.594
WAY. TO WASHINGTON UP TO FIVE

03:31:47.661 --> 03:31:49.263
AND ALONG THE RAILROAD TRACKS

03:31:49.329 --> 03:31:50.197
GOES RIGHT TO THE COMMUNITY OF

03:31:50.264 --> 03:31:53.467
DUNSMUIR. AND AM NOT SHASTA.

03:31:53.534 --> 03:31:55.335
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE I

03:31:55.402 --> 03:31:56.904
CAN THROW A ROCK FROM THE TOWN

03:31:56.970 --> 03:31:58.405
TO THE RAILROAD TRACK BUT I

03:31:58.472 --> 03:32:00.174
DON'T GET TO ACCESS IT BECAUSE

03:32:00.240 --> 03:32:03.243
THEY CHOOSE NOT TO. WE TALK

03:32:03.310 --> 03:32:06.613
ABOUT. BUILT OUT AREAS. WE WANT

03:32:06.680 --> 03:32:08.082
TO EXTEND ON OF THOSE BUILT OR

03:32:08.148 --> 03:32:09.616
IS ALREADY BUT THEY'RE OWNED BY

03:32:09.683 --> 03:32:11.351
PRIVATE COMPANIES. AND THOSE

03:32:11.418 --> 03:32:13.253
PRIVATE COMPANIES CHOOSE NOT TO

03:32:13.320 --> 03:32:16.123
USE THESE FUNDS. TO HELP OUR

03:32:16.190 --> 03:32:17.991
COMMUNITIES AND YOU TALK ABOUT.

03:32:18.058 --> 03:32:20.661
THE CO THE PANDEMIC AND A

03:32:20.727 --> 03:32:22.429
PERSONALLY HAPPENED TO ME IN MY

03:32:22.496 --> 03:32:25.199
IN MY OWN FAMILY RIGHT I HAD TO

03:32:25.265 --> 03:32:25.933
GET I I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE I

03:32:25.999 --> 03:32:27.968
HAVE A DISH. ON THE TOP OF

03:32:28.035 --> 03:32:30.704
MINE. SHOP AT MY PROPERTY WHERE

03:32:30.771 --> 03:32:33.073
I. PERFORMED THE COMES OFF OF

03:32:33.140 --> 03:32:35.175
THE WATER TOWER IN TOWN WHICH

03:32:35.242 --> 03:32:37.244
IS SEVEN MILES AWAY TO GET

03:32:37.311 --> 03:32:39.446
INTERNET SO MY KIDS CAN BARELY

03:32:39.513 --> 03:32:40.981
GET ON AND WORK. THE

03:32:41.048 --> 03:32:42.449
INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE'S A LOT

03:32:42.516 --> 03:32:43.517
OF INFRASTRUCTURE OUT ALREADY

03:32:43.584 --> 03:32:45.185
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY

03:32:45.252 --> 03:32:46.553
TO TAP INTO IT SO WHAT WE DO IS

03:32:46.620 --> 03:32:48.822
WE TAKE THESE FUNDS. AND WE

03:32:48.889 --> 03:32:50.757
HAVE TO BUILD AROUND THEM. WE

03:32:50.824 --> 03:32:52.226
DON'T GET THE TOP OFF OF WHAT'S

03:32:52.292 --> 03:32:54.094
ALREADY THERE AND EXTEND OUT

03:32:54.161 --> 03:32:56.296
THAT LAST MILE. OR THAT. DIDN'T

03:32:56.363 --> 03:32:58.265
MAKE THE MIDDLE MILE. THAT'S

03:32:58.332 --> 03:33:00.033
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PIECE OF

03:33:00.100 --> 03:33:02.536
LEGISLATION IS THAT IT DOESN'T.

03:33:02.603 --> 03:33:04.438
USE EXISTING STRUCTURE WE HAVE

03:33:04.505 --> 03:33:05.939
TO BUILD ALL NEW ND YOU CAN'T

03:33:06.006 --> 03:33:07.741
AFFORD TO DO IT. ONE LAST

03:33:07.808 --> 03:33:09.610
POINT. DIGITAL THREE NINETY

03:33:09.676 --> 03:33:12.112
FIVE WAS A FEDERAL. AMOUNT OF

03:33:12.179 --> 03:33:15.415
MONEY THAT CAME IN. AND IT DID

03:33:15.482 --> 03:33:16.016
THREE NINETY FIVE ALL THE WAY

03:33:16.083 --> 03:33:17.951
UP THE BACKSIDE OF THIS YEAR'S

03:33:18.018 --> 03:33:19.520
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

03:33:19.586 --> 03:33:20.120
TIME THERE'S ONE PERSON LOOKED

03:33:20.187 --> 03:33:22.956
UP TO IT. THAT IS THE PROBLEM

03:33:23.023 --> 03:33:24.925
WITH THESE TYPES OF LEGISLATION

03:33:24.992 --> 03:33:26.293
THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS

03:33:26.360 --> 03:33:28.095
DOING THE SAME THING EXPECTING

03:33:28.162 --> 03:33:28.729
A DIFFERENT OUTCOME WE'RE GONNA

03:33:28.795 --> 03:33:30.797
HAVE THE SAME OUTCOME. UNTIL WE

03:33:30.864 --> 03:33:31.965
FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE SAY

03:33:32.032 --> 03:33:33.600
HEY. WE WANT TO GET TO THAT

03:33:33.667 --> 03:33:34.801
PERSON THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE

03:33:34.868 --> 03:33:36.570
MILE AND LAST MILE. AND

03:33:36.637 --> 03:33:39.339
UTILITIES WE'RE GONNA PAY FOR

03:33:39.406 --> 03:33:39.973
BUT YOU GOTTA LOVE TOOK IN YOUR

03:33:40.040 --> 03:33:42.476
SYSTEM. AS IF WE HAD IF WE GO

03:33:42.543 --> 03:33:43.143
THE OTHER ROUTE WE'RE NEVER

03:33:43.210 --> 03:33:44.478
GOING TO GET THERE. THAT'S

03:33:44.545 --> 03:33:46.013
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS WE'RE

03:33:46.079 --> 03:33:47.014
GONNA CONTINUE TO DO WHAT

03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:49.516
GOVERNMENT ALWAYS DOES WE HAVE

03:33:49.583 --> 03:33:50.150
A PROBLEM WE JUST KEEP THROWING

03:33:50.217 --> 03:33:51.952
MORE MONEY AT IT. BUT WE NEED

03:33:52.019 --> 03:33:54.021
TO ACTUALLY. SO YOU SEE WHAT

03:33:54.087 --> 03:33:55.022
THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT A IT'S

03:33:55.088 --> 03:33:56.390
NOT A PROBLEM MONEY IT'S A

03:33:56.456 --> 03:33:59.126
PROBLEM OF THE POLICY. SO FOR

03:33:59.193 --> 03:34:00.294
THOSE REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT

03:34:00.360 --> 03:34:01.728
THIS I WANT TO I WANT TO GIVE

03:34:01.795 --> 03:34:03.497
THE MONEY TO GO DO IT. BUT I

03:34:03.564 --> 03:34:04.464
KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET

03:34:04.531 --> 03:34:06.133
THERE. AND WE NEED TO FIX IT WE

03:34:06.200 --> 03:34:07.401
NEED TO GO SIT DOWN THE TELCOS

03:34:07.467 --> 03:34:10.003
ESSAY. AND THE CPUC AND SAY.

TELL US WHAT WE NEED TO GET

03:34:11.138 --> 03:34:13.006
THERE AND WE'LL FIND IT. BUT

03:34:13.073 --> 03:34:14.241
WE'RE DOING AT THE BACK WAY

03:34:14.308 --> 03:34:15.209
WE'RE GOING WE'RE GIVEN THE

03:34:15.275 --> 03:34:17.144
MONEY. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING

03:34:17.211 --> 03:34:18.445
WHAT WE DESERVE. THANK YOU.

EXCEEDINGLY HIGH. THEY ARE

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:55.529

U. S. FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS.

03:38:22.222 --> 03:38:24.124
UNDER CURRENT LAW LOW INCOME

03:38:24.191 --> 03:38:25.525

DIABETES OR HEART CONDITION.

03:38:36.703 --> 03:38:37.904
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

03:38:37.971 --> 03:38:41.241
THAT- CAN BE TREATED. AND

03:38:41.308 --> 03:38:42.609
CANNIBAL IT HIGHER COSTS IN THE

03:38:42.676 --> 03:38:45.545

03:38:45.612 --> 03:38:46.446
THAT MEANS THEY RELY ON

03:38:46.513 --> 03:38:48.348
EMERGENCY ROOMS AND LAST RESORT

03:38:48.415 --> 03:38:49.916

ESCALATES TO A POINT OF CRISIS

03:38:51.985 --> 03:38:54.087
THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT. ONE

03:38:54.154 --> 03:38:55.789

03:38:55.856 --> 03:38:57.424

HE BROKE HIS ARM AT WORK

03:39:36.363 --> 03:39:38.198
FEARING THE UNEXPECTED HOSPITAL

03:39:38.265 --> 03:39:39.533

MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I'VE BEEN

04:26:49.960 --> 04:26:52.696
READING A LOT LATELY ABOUT THE

04:26:52.763 --> 04:26:54.798
SO CALLED ACCIDENTS OUT OF

CALIFORNIA WHICH SUPPOSEDLY

04:26:56.934 --> 04:26:58.635
HAPPENED DURING THE PANDEMIC

04:26:58.702 --> 04:27:00.437
FROM THERE WASN'T THAT LARGE OF

04:27:00.504 --> 04:27:03.707
AN ACCIDENT IN FACT. HOWEVER

04:27:03.774 --> 04:27:06.977
THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT WAS

04:27:07.044 --> 04:27:08.712
CITED BY THOSE WHO LEFT

04:27:08.779 --> 04:27:11.315
INCLUDING THE BUSINESSES THAT

04:27:11.382 --> 04:27:13.951
LACK. WHAT'S NOT OUR TAXES. NO

04:27:14.017 --> 04:27:17.287
IT WAS THE COST OF HOUSING. THE

04:27:17.354 --> 04:27:20.624
END WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

04:27:20.691 --> 04:27:23.160
INTEREST STATE MOVING THOSE

04:27:23.227 --> 04:27:24.995
FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE LEFT. ARE

04:27:25.062 --> 04:27:27.364
EXTREMELY HIGH COST HOUSING

04:27:27.431 --> 04:27:31.034
AREAS. THOSE FOLKS HAVE ALSO

04:27:31.101 --> 04:27:33.504
MOVED. DUE TO THE COST OF

04:27:33.570 --> 04:27:39.610
HOUSING. THEY MOVED TO AREAS.

04:27:39.676 --> 04:27:40.778
TWO THREE HOURS AWAY FROM WHERE

04:27:40.844 --> 04:27:42.579
THEY WORKED BECAUSE THE COST OF

04:27:42.646 --> 04:27:46.583
HOUSING NOW WHY DO WE HAVE SUCH

04:27:46.650 --> 04:27:49.420
HIGH COST OF HOUSING. BECAUSE

04:27:49.486 --> 04:27:51.021
WE HAVE NOT BUILT ENOUGH. BUT I

04:27:51.088 --> 04:27:53.590
WOULD MOST SUIT MYSELF JUST AS

04:27:53.657 --> 04:27:57.094
SOON NOT HAVE. TO BE- THAT

04:27:57.161 --> 04:27:58.729
HAPPENED UNDER THE STRICTURES

04:27:58.796 --> 04:28:00.431
OF SUPPLY SIDE ECONOMICS BUT

04:28:00.497 --> 04:28:02.232
IT'S A FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT

04:28:02.299 --> 04:28:04.768
PRODUCED THE DISPOSSESSED. THAT

04:28:04.835 --> 04:28:07.638
WE NEED AND UNTIL WE DO WE ARE

04:28:07.704 --> 04:28:10.507
NOT GOING TO LOWER THE COST OF

04:28:10.574 --> 04:28:13.377
HOUSING. THIS ONE IS AN EASY

04:28:13.444 --> 04:28:15.612
MEASURE IT DOESN'T FORCE ANY OF

04:28:15.679 --> 04:28:16.880
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO IT

04:28:16.947 --> 04:28:19.216
BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE WILLING.

04:28:19.283 --> 04:28:20.818
TO ADD A LITTLE MORE DENSITY

04:28:20.884 --> 04:28:23.053
WHERE THERE ALREADY IS HIGH

04:28:23.120 --> 04:28:25.189
NUMBERS OF JOBS AND

04:28:25.255 --> 04:28:26.557

MAKE IT EASIER FASTER AND LESS

04:31:00.677 --> 04:31:03.513
EXPENSIVE. FOR YOU TO DO THAT.

04:31:03.580 --> 04:31:05.148
THIS IS A BENEFIT FOR CITIES

04:31:05.215 --> 04:31:07.618
AND IT DOESN'T TAKE ANY POWER

04:31:07.684 --> 04:31:09.453
AWAY FROM THEM. I DIDN'T THE

04:31:09.519 --> 04:31:12.456
BILL I DID NOTICE THAT. THE

04:31:12.522 --> 04:31:14.257
OBVIOUS DOES NOT ALLOW

04:31:14.324 --> 04:31:16.226
COMMUNITY INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS

04:31:16.293 --> 04:31:19.830

04:31:22.232 --> 04:31:23.867
DEVELOPMENT IN A PARTICULAR.

04:31:23.934 --> 04:31:25.936
OUR H. AWAY OR COMMUNITY

04:31:26.003 --> 04:31:27.638
INTEREST DEVELOPMENT IS THAT

04:31:27.704 --> 04:31:31.475
CORRECT THAT'S COMPARED TO THE

04:31:31.541 --> 04:31:32.843
S. B. NINE. THE PRESIDENT IS

04:31:32.909 --> 04:31:34.645

NOT- EXAMS IT'S ALWAYS- CITIES

04:31:41.718 --> 04:31:43.954
ALREADY HAVE LATITUDE THESE ARE

04:31:44.021 --> 04:31:46.356
THE H. O. A.'S- AND THIS

04:31:46.423 --> 04:31:48.759
DOESN'T CHANGE OUT. THERE THE

04:31:48.825 --> 04:31:51.561

TALKING TO THEM NOW ABOUT

04:31:54.631 --> 04:31:57.401
TECHNICAL LANGUAGE BECAUSE THEY

04:31:57.467 --> 04:31:58.969
RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN

04:31:59.036 --> 04:32:01.371
UNINTENDED. SIDE EFFECTS THAT

04:32:01.438 --> 04:32:03.840
WE DON'T INTEND- AND SO WERE

04:32:03.907 --> 04:32:05.609

04:32:08.679 --> 04:32:10.947
ISSUES BECAUSE WE WANT TO WORK

04:32:11.014 --> 04:32:12.249
WITH THEM TO RESOLVE IT

04:32:12.315 --> 04:32:12.883
OBVIOUSLY THAT WON'T HAPPEN IN

04:32:12.949 --> 04:32:15.285
THE SENATE- BUT COMMITTED TO.

04:32:15.352 --> 04:32:21.224

THROUGH ALL OF THE OTHER HOUSES

04:32:28.065 --> 04:32:29.266
SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE

04:32:29.332 --> 04:32:31.368
STILL VERY. CONCERNING TO OUR

04:32:31.435 --> 04:32:32.636

THE IMPACTS AND I WILL GIVE AN

04:32:37.774 --> 04:32:40.010
EXAMPLE. OF THE STREET THAT I

EXACT RIGHT AWAY TO ACCOMMODATE

04:32:46.483 --> 04:32:48.251
THE KIND OF DEVELOPMENT THAT

04:32:48.318 --> 04:32:49.119
WAS ON THAT BLOCK SO PUBLIC

04:32:49.186 --> 04:32:50.987
SAFETY VIA VEHICLES. LAW

04:32:51.054 --> 04:32:53.056
ENFORCEMENT FIRE ENGINES HAVE

04:32:53.123 --> 04:32:54.691
DIFFICULTY GETTING DOWN THE

STREET TURNING AROUND IN A CUL

04:32:56.259 --> 04:32:58.428
THE SAP DEVELOPMENT. WHEN

04:32:58.495 --> 04:33:00.097
THERE'S NO PARKING REQUIREMENTS

04:33:00.163 --> 04:33:01.732
WHICH WE HAVE. IN OUR

04:33:01.798 --> 04:33:03.333
DEVELOPMENT AS A MATTER OF FACT

04:33:03.400 --> 04:33:05.235
SO THE USERS SIGNIFICANT

ADDRESSED FRANKLY WITH MANY OF

04:33:08.772 --> 04:33:10.874

OF THOSE CONCERNS BY MAKING

04:33:23.053 --> 04:33:24.755
THIS PERMISSIVE. ALLOWING LOCAL

04:33:24.821 --> 04:33:26.857
GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE MORE SAY

04:33:26.923 --> 04:33:28.492

STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS OUR

04:33:47.711 --> 04:33:50.747
CONCERNS- I HAD SOME CONCERNS

04:33:50.814 --> 04:33:52.182
INITIALLY BUT THE ONE SIZE FITS

04:33:52.249 --> 04:33:53.784
ALL APPROACH AND HOW IT APPLIES

04:33:53.850 --> 04:33:55.318
CERTAIN CITIES IN MY DISTRICT.

04:33:55.385 --> 04:33:57.387
I THINK OF LAGUNA BEACH A PLACE

04:33:57.454 --> 04:33:58.955
THAT HAS A ROBUST ECONOMY BUT

04:33:59.022 --> 04:34:01.291
NOT ENOUGH INFRASTRUCTURE OR-

04:34:01.358 --> 04:34:02.559
THROUGH WAYS TO REALLY SUPPORT

04:34:02.626 --> 04:34:03.627
A LOT OF INCREASED DENSITY AT

THIS TIME. I APPRECIATE THE

04:34:05.595 --> 04:34:07.364
SENATOR FOR TAKING THE

04:34:07.430 --> 04:34:09.332
PERMISSIVE APPROACH AND

04:34:09.399 --> 04:34:10.567
ALLOWING SOME MEASURE OF LOCAL

04:34:10.634 --> 04:34:12.169
CONTROL. ON AND ALSO FOR

04:34:12.235 --> 04:34:13.804
PARTICULAR REMOVING THE JOB

04:34:13.870 --> 04:34:15.472
SERVICE PROVISION OF THIS BILL-

04:34:15.539 --> 04:34:17.240
WHICH ALLOWS FOR DISTRICTS LIKE

04:34:17.307 --> 04:34:19.042
MINE TO INCREASE DENSITY IN

04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:20.977
WAYS THAT ARE NOT. HARMFUL TO

04:34:21.044 --> 04:34:23.647
OUR CONCERNS. AS I SAID BEFORE

04:34:23.713 --> 04:34:26.550
THE HOUSING CRISIS IS JUST

04:34:26.616 --> 04:34:28.051
INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC RIGHT

04:34:28.118 --> 04:34:30.053
NOW. IT'S A MORAL CRISIS AND WE

04:34:30.120 --> 04:34:31.721
KNOW THAT THE TOP CAUSE OF

04:34:31.788 --> 04:34:33.190
HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE RIGHT

04:34:33.256 --> 04:34:34.758
NOW IS A LACK OF AFFORDABLE

04:34:34.825 --> 04:34:37.494
HOUSING. IS AN ECONOMIC CRISIS

04:34:37.561 --> 04:34:39.329
THAT IS BREWING I WANT TO SEE

04:34:39.396 --> 04:34:41.064
MYSELF WITH MY COMMENTS FROM MY

04:34:41.131 --> 04:34:43.133
COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY- WE

04:34:43.200 --> 04:34:44.467
KNOW THAT THE TOP REASON THAT

04:34:44.534 --> 04:34:45.468
PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE STATE

04:34:45.535 --> 04:34:46.970
AND OR MOVING. IS BECAUSE OF

04:34:47.037 --> 04:34:48.471
THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING WE

04:34:48.538 --> 04:34:49.906
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

04:34:49.973 --> 04:34:51.041
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD

04:34:51.107 --> 04:34:52.642
TO LIVE HERE OUR SENIORS CAN'T

04:34:52.709 --> 04:34:54.244
RETIRE WITH DIGNITY WORKING

04:34:54.311 --> 04:34:55.779
CLASS CALIFORNIANS. CAN'T

04:34:55.846 --> 04:34:57.581
AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE STATE. WE

04:34:57.647 --> 04:34:59.382
NEED SOME MEASURE BEYOND JUST

04:34:59.449 --> 04:35:00.483
DELEGATING THIS TO OUR

04:35:00.550 --> 04:35:02.485
LOCALITIES- THIS IS THE TYPE OF

04:35:02.552 --> 04:35:03.653
MEASURE THE STICKS AND CARROTS

04:35:03.720 --> 04:35:04.888
THAT WE NEED TO START.

04:35:04.955 --> 04:35:06.389
IMPLEMENTING TO TRY TO REALLY

04:35:06.456 --> 04:35:07.657
RESOLVE THIS HOUSING CRISIS SO

04:35:07.724 --> 04:35:09.960
I COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND I URGE

04:35:10.026 --> 04:35:11.494

SOONER OR LATER. THANK YOU VERY

04:35:13.597 --> 04:35:16.533
MUCH MR PRESIDENT- I FELT LIKE

04:35:16.600 --> 04:35:18.435
I WANTED TO COMMENT BECAUSE I

04:35:18.501 --> 04:35:20.971
WAS WATCHING BILLS LIKE THIS.

04:35:21.037 --> 04:35:22.906
WHILE I WAS RUNNING AND THIS IS

04:35:22.973 --> 04:35:25.242
THE FIRST REAL ONE THAT HAS

04:35:25.308 --> 04:35:27.210
COME UP. SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE

04:35:27.277 --> 04:35:29.646
AND- I WAS ELECTED TO REPRESENT

04:35:29.713 --> 04:35:31.514
A DISTRICT THAT HAS TWENTY ONE

04:35:31.581 --> 04:35:36.920
CITIES. AND IN THE LAST EIGHT

04:35:36.987 --> 04:35:39.289
OR RATIONS OVER STRONG BILL.

04:35:39.356 --> 04:35:40.891
FROM THE AUTHOR- TWENTY CITIES

04:35:40.957 --> 04:35:43.927
OPPOSE IT THE ONE BIGGEST SANTA.

04:35:43.994 --> 04:35:45.729
FOR IT WAS A GOOD I. IN THIS

04:35:45.795 --> 04:35:48.265
THE CONCERN. OBVIOUSLY

04:35:48.331 --> 04:35:51.334
OVERRIDING LOCAL LAND USE. BUT

04:35:51.401 --> 04:35:52.936
THE ISSUED IT TO GO WITH THE

04:35:53.003 --> 04:35:55.906
SENATOR FROM BERKLEY SAID. HE

04:35:55.972 --> 04:35:58.675
HE IF OUR IDEA OF CREATING

04:35:58.742 --> 04:36:01.244
AFFORDABILITY IS CLOSING THE

04:36:01.311 --> 04:36:04.381
THREE MILLION. UNITS GAP OF

04:36:04.447 --> 04:36:06.416
HOUSING. WHAT IS NOT GOING TO

04:36:06.483 --> 04:36:09.119
GET THERE. IN A DECADE OR TWO

04:36:09.185 --> 04:36:11.688
DECADES. AND SO TO DO BILLS

04:36:11.755 --> 04:36:14.124
LIKE THIS AND NOT HAVE SOME

04:36:14.190 --> 04:36:16.526
MEASURE OF AFFORDABILITY AND

04:36:16.593 --> 04:36:19.162
THEM. IS CHALLENGING A. N. D.

04:36:19.229 --> 04:36:20.931
THERE ARE DESERT LEAST ONE

04:36:20.997 --> 04:36:22.499
BUILDER TO DISPUTE GOING ON IN

04:36:22.565 --> 04:36:24.868
MY DISTRICT. WHERE IT EXPEDITED

04:36:24.935 --> 04:36:26.036
THE PROCESS WITH THE

04:36:26.102 --> 04:36:27.170
REQUIREMENT OF A CERTAIN

04:36:27.237 --> 04:36:29.239
PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE. AND

04:36:29.306 --> 04:36:32.342
YET THE LOCAL CITIES ALREADY

04:36:32.409 --> 04:36:34.644
HAVE THAT AFFORDABLE. ENDED

04:36:34.711 --> 04:36:37.380
OVER ROAD THAT SO WAS EXPLORING

04:36:37.447 --> 04:36:39.983
THE PROCESS WITH NO INCREASE IN

04:36:40.050 --> 04:36:41.851
AFFORDABLE UNITS AND SO I THINK

04:36:41.918 --> 04:36:44.321
THE CHALLENGES. IS HOW TO

04:36:44.387 --> 04:36:46.890
PRESENT THESE BILLS WITH SOME

04:36:46.957 --> 04:36:48.892
PERCENTAGE FOR MEASURE OF

04:36:48.959 --> 04:36:51.194
AFFORDABILITY AND- BECAUSE OF

04:36:51.261 --> 04:36:53.463
ITS GONNA TAKE US TWENTY OR

04:36:53.530 --> 04:36:55.065
THIRTY YEARS. TO GET ENOUGH

04:36:55.131 --> 04:36:57.400
UNITS TO AFFECT THE MARKET. THE

04:36:57.467 --> 04:36:59.202
CRISIS THAT EVERYBODY DESCRIBED

04:36:59.269 --> 04:37:00.637
IS NOT GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY

04:37:00.704 --> 04:37:02.706
THESE BILLS AND SO I THINK IT'S

04:37:02.772 --> 04:37:04.908
OUR CHALLENGE. TO FIGURE OUT

04:37:04.975 --> 04:37:06.743
HOWTHERE IS A PERCENTAGE OF

04:37:06.810 --> 04:37:09.813
AFFORDABILITY IN EACH OF THESE

04:37:09.879 --> 04:37:12.515
AS THEY COME BY US. AND IN THIS

04:37:12.582 --> 04:37:14.517
ONE I GIVE CREDIT TO THE OFFER.

04:37:14.584 --> 04:37:16.186
BECAUSE HE MOVED HE MADE IT

04:37:16.252 --> 04:37:18.755
VOLUNTARY. BECAUSE IT'S

04:37:18.822 --> 04:37:26.730
VOLUNTARY. R. WILL LIKELY VOTE

04:37:26.796 --> 04:37:27.330

THE STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERRIDE

04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:40.877
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO I JUST

04:37:40.944 --> 04:37:41.878
THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

04:37:41.945 --> 04:37:43.480

A FUTURE ONCE COMMA I THINK

04:37:49.152 --> 04:37:50.487
I'LL BE LOOKING TO SEE IF

04:37:50.553 --> 04:37:52.288
THERE'S AFFORDABLE BUILDING IN

04:37:52.355 --> 04:37:54.624
THEM THAT'S SORT OF HOW I WILL

04:37:54.691 --> 04:37:57.027
JUDGE WHETHER TO LOOK AT THE-

04:37:57.093 --> 04:37:58.928

ALL HEARD THIS IS A GREAT

04:38:09.606 --> 04:38:13.209
ATTEMPT TO- TRY TO GET THE

04:38:13.276 --> 04:38:15.645
DENSITIES WERE COMMUNITIES WANT

04:38:15.712 --> 04:38:16.279
TO DO IT AND THEY HAVE THE

04:38:16.346 --> 04:38:18.982
POWERTO DO IT. AS WE SHOULD

04:38:19.049 --> 04:38:19.616
BUT I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

04:38:19.682 --> 04:38:21.951

04:38:23.253 --> 04:38:24.754
GREAT POINT ABOUT PEOPLE

04:38:24.821 --> 04:38:26.289
EXITING CALIFORNIA. AND

04:38:26.356 --> 04:38:27.991
BASICALLY THE COST OF LIVING IN

04:38:28.058 --> 04:38:29.526
CALIFORNIA IS A SOMETHING THAT.

04:38:29.592 --> 04:38:31.494
BUT I THINK IT IS AND SHE NOTED

04:38:31.561 --> 04:38:34.831
THAT. TAXES AREN'T THE REASON

04:38:34.898 --> 04:38:35.331
THAT PEOPLE ARE LEAVING

04:38:35.398 --> 04:38:37.500
CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULD SHARE

04:38:37.567 --> 04:38:38.968
WITH YOU REGULATIONS ARE THE

04:38:39.035 --> 04:38:40.170
REASON PEOPLE ARE LEAVING

04:38:40.236 --> 04:38:41.604
CALIFORNIA WHAT DRIVES UP THE

04:38:41.671 --> 04:38:45.742
COST OF HOUSING. IS SICK WHAT

04:38:45.809 --> 04:38:49.446
AND LOCAL TAXES FOR SCHOOLS AND

04:38:49.512 --> 04:38:51.614
ROADS AND YOU NAME IT IT'S ALL

04:38:51.681 --> 04:38:55.485
PILED ONTO. THE DEVELOPER AND

04:38:55.552 --> 04:38:56.453
THAT DRIVES THE COST OF

04:38:56.519 --> 04:38:58.288
HOUSING- IF WE REALLY TRULY

04:38:58.354 --> 04:39:00.523
WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT

04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:02.492
FACE CALIFORNIA AND THE COST OF

04:39:02.559 --> 04:39:05.962
HOUSING. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE

04:39:06.029 --> 04:39:07.397
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT

04:39:07.464 --> 04:39:09.065
WE'RE IN AND FIGURE OUT A WAY

04:39:09.132 --> 04:39:10.300
TO DRIVE THE COST OF BUILDING

04:39:10.366 --> 04:39:12.836
THOSE HOUSES DOWN. TO GET TO

04:39:12.902 --> 04:39:14.771
THE NUMBERS THAT WE NEED TO GET

04:39:14.838 --> 04:39:16.773
TO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT. TO DO.

04:39:16.840 --> 04:39:18.508
AND FILL PROJECTS WHERE WE

04:39:18.575 --> 04:39:19.809
SHOULD WE'RE WE HAVE TRANCE

04:39:19.876 --> 04:39:20.877
TRANSPORTATION WE HAVE

04:39:20.944 --> 04:39:22.345
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALL GOING

04:39:22.412 --> 04:39:24.180
TO BE POSITIVE. TO DRIVE THAT

04:39:24.247 --> 04:39:25.748
COSTS DOWN BUT IF WE REALLY

04:39:25.815 --> 04:39:28.218
WANT TO TACKLE- THE ABILITY TO

04:39:28.284 --> 04:39:31.020
BE ABLE TO. GROW MORE HOUSES IN

04:39:31.087 --> 04:39:32.622
CALIFORNIA AT A RATE WHERE

04:39:32.689 --> 04:39:33.990
PEOPLE CAN AFFECT THEM WE HAVE

04:39:34.057 --> 04:39:35.125
TO TALK ABOUT THE COST OF

04:39:35.191 --> 04:39:36.960
LIVING. AND THE COST OF LIVING

04:39:37.026 --> 04:39:40.630
IS NOT JUST THE HOUSE. IT'S THE

04:39:40.697 --> 04:39:42.031
COST OF LIVING FOR FUEL THE

04:39:42.098 --> 04:39:43.266
COST OF LIVING FOR THE LECTURE

04:39:43.333 --> 04:39:44.868
CITY THE COST OF LIVING FOR ALL

04:39:44.934 --> 04:39:46.769
THOSE THINGS ARE ADDED INTO.

04:39:46.836 --> 04:39:48.404
WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA ONE OF

04:39:48.471 --> 04:39:50.273
THE MOST DIFFICULT STATES TO BE

04:39:50.340 --> 04:39:51.641
ABLE TO LIVE IN BECAUSE THE

04:39:51.708 --> 04:39:52.642
COST OF LIVING ACROSS THE

04:39:52.709 --> 04:39:54.244
BOARD. IS HIGHER THAN OTHER

04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:57.180
PLACES AND WE NEED TO BE

04:39:57.247 --> 04:39:58.081
COMPETITIVE. AT SOME POINT. YOU

04:39:58.148 --> 04:39:59.949
CAN'T JUST CONTINUE TO. ADD

04:40:00.016 --> 04:40:01.584
THOSE COST ON AND EXPECT PEOPLE

04:40:01.651 --> 04:40:02.619
NOT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO

04:40:02.685 --> 04:40:05.221
LIVE HERE AND MOVE OUT. AT THE

04:40:05.288 --> 04:40:05.855
SAME TIME WE TALK ABOUT DRIVING

04:40:05.922 --> 04:40:08.057
UP. THINGS LIKE THE MINIMUM

04:40:08.124 --> 04:40:10.660
WAGE AND TRY TO GET UP THEIR-WAGES. BUT WE STILL HAVE TO BE

04:40:10.727 --> 04:40:12.629
IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET. THE

04:40:12.695 --> 04:40:13.763
COMMODITIES IN THE THINGS THAT

04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:15.832
WE- HAVE TO OFFER HERE IN

04:40:15.899 --> 04:40:18.701
CALIFORNIA- HAVE TO COMPETE

04:40:18.768 --> 04:40:20.170
WITH OTHER STATES AND OTHER

04:40:20.236 --> 04:40:21.838
NATIONS SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE

04:40:21.905 --> 04:40:23.706
FACED WITH. THIS BILL IS A

04:40:23.773 --> 04:40:25.542
STREAMLINING PROCESS AND ALLOWS

04:40:25.608 --> 04:40:26.809
THE LOCALS TO DO THE RIGHT

04:40:26.876 --> 04:40:27.577
THING I THINK THIS IS STEP IN

04:40:27.644 --> 04:40:28.511
RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IF WE

04:40:28.578 --> 04:40:29.946
REALLY WANT TO DO THE RIGHT.

04:40:30.013 --> 04:40:31.714
THE OVERALL CHALLENGE THAT

04:40:31.781 --> 04:40:32.749
WE'RE FACED WITH WE HAVE TO

04:40:32.815 --> 04:40:34.217
DRIVE THE COST OF BUILDING

04:40:34.284 --> 04:40:36.186
THESE HOUSES DOWN. SO I URGE

04:40:36.252 --> 04:40:38.254
AND I VOTE. THANK YOU HE FOR

04:40:38.321 --> 04:40:39.589

CRISIS IN OUR STATE. BUT I

THINK THE AUTHOR FROM FROM SAN

04:41:14.157 --> 04:41:15.792
FRANCISCO IS DONE A TERRIFIC

04:41:15.858 --> 04:41:16.993

PROVIDE LOCAL CONTROL. AND IT'S

04:41:27.403 --> 04:41:28.204

THE SENATOR FROM BEAVER- I

04:41:50.760 --> 04:41:51.361
AGREE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

04:41:51.427 --> 04:41:53.663
THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS IS ONE

04:41:53.730 --> 04:41:56.065
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE ZONING IS

04:41:56.132 --> 04:41:57.800
FUNDAMENTALLY- THE IT'S ABOUT

04:41:57.867 --> 04:41:59.302
MATH IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH.

04:41:59.369 --> 04:42:01.537
NUMERICALLY HOW MANY HOMES ARE

04:42:01.604 --> 04:42:03.506
LEGAL TO BUILD IN A PARTICULAR

04:42:03.573 --> 04:42:06.175
AREA AND THIS WILL ALLOW CITIES

04:42:06.242 --> 04:42:07.243
TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO

04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:10.313

CRUZ AND AS SOMEONE ALL ON ALL

04:42:18.521 --> 04:42:20.456
OF THE MANDATORY HOUSING BILLS

04:42:20.523 --> 04:42:23.926

TO A CITY COURT ALL THIS ZONING

04:42:38.675 --> 04:42:40.677
COULD BE FOR A 100% AFFORDABLE

04:42:40.743 --> 04:42:42.545
BUT ANY LOCAL INCLUSIONARY THAT

04:42:42.612 --> 04:42:44.747
THE CITY HAS- WILL APPLY TO

04:42:44.814 --> 04:42:46.449
THIS BILL OTHER CITIES

BENEFITS FOR AFFORDABLE

04:42:52.322 --> 04:42:54.057

THE BEST TIME TO PLANT A TREE
