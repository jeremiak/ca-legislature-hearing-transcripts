00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:31.217
ABOUT STREAMLINING WE TALK ABOUT --

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.252
SEQUEL -- TECHNICAL TERMS WHICH

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.387
ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT -- BUT I

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:37.390
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.625
PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE THE

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:40.893
ONES WHO ARE AFFECTED.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.297
BY CALIFORNIA'S ABYSMAL FAILURE.

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.765
TO PRODUCE ENOUGH HOUSING OVER

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:48.634
THE PAST NUMBER OF DECADES.

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:51.070
WE USED TO PRODUCE IN THE EARLY

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.806
NINETEEN SIXTIES 200-500-0023

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:54.340
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS OF

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:56.042
HOUSING PER YEAR IN CALIFORNIA

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.109
AT A TIME WHEN WE HAD A

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:58.444
POPULATION OF FIFTEEN MILLION

00:07:58.511 --> 00:07:59.345
PEOPLE.

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:01.514
WE NOW HAVE ALMOST THREE TIMES A

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.449
POPULATION FORTY MILLION PEOPLE

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:04.350
AND GROWING.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:08.654
AND INSTEAD OF PRODUCING TWO

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:09.255
HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:09.856
THOUSAND UNITS PER YEAR RIGHT

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:10.656
NOW PRODUCING. EIGHTY TO A

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:11.290
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS WITH GONE

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:14.427
DOWN BY ABOUT TWO THIRDS AS OUR

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:14.727
POPULATION.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:15.561
TRIPLED.

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:17.330
AND REAL PEOPLE ARE HURTING

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.765
RIGHT NOW -- IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.534
SEE THE HOMELESSNESS IN OUR

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:22.802
STATE WHICH IS GROWING AT

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.203
ALTHOUGH MENTAL HEALTH AND

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.105
ADDICTION ARE PARTS OF THE

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:26.806
HOMELESS SUBATOMIC.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.741
MANY MANY HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.576
NOT MENTALLY ILL ARE NOT

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:32.712
ADDICTED THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:33.713
HOUSING AS OF THEIR SLEEPING IN

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:36.249
SHELTERS OR IN THEIR CARS OR CAL

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:37.250
SURFING.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:39.518
CULTURE BRING ONE IN -- TWENTY

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.220
SCHOOL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:48.294
ONE IN TWENTY IS HOMELESS.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.096
EVERYONE KNOWS A FAMILY OR MANY

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:52.365
FAMILIES WHO HAVE MOVED AWAY.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:52.932
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:53.799
LIVE HERE THEY HAD THAT SECOND

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.134
KID AND THEY NEEDED MORE SPACE

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.669
AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.504
COMMUNITY. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.739
TO AFFORD AND SO THEY ARE NOW

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.374
COMMUTING TO OURS OR MAYBE

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.708
THEY'RE LIVING IN DENVER OR

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:03.809
AUSTIN.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.679
ARE WE ARE METHODICALLY PUSHING

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:08.347
THE MIDDLE CLASS OUT OF MANY

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:10.082
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:12.585
MAKING A PROGRESSIVELY HARDER.

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:15.488
FOR WORKING FAMILIES TO BE ABLE

00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:17.223
TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.858
AND WE ARE MAKING IT DIFFICULT

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:21.627
OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:23.996
TO BE ABLE TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.665
MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:28.668
ABOUT BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.036
HAVING STABLE HOUSING.

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:32.071
YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T SEE

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.773
WHAT THEIR FUTURE IS AND OUR

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.675
COMMUNITY AND HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:37.610
HAVE COMMENTED I REALLY WISH

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:39.312
THAT MY KID COULD MOVE BACK HOME

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:41.080
AFTER COLLEGE BUT UNLESS YOU'RE

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.648
GOING TO LIVE IN MY BASEMENT --

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.116
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE EVER

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.084
GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IN

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:48.020
THE TOWN IN WHICH I GREW UP. TO

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.355
THIS IT IS THESE OF HUMAN

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.923
CONSEQUENCES.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.426
OF OUR FRANKLY DELIBERATE

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:54.961
FAILURE TO BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:56.529
WITH ADOPTED WHAT I CALL HOUSING

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:59.699
LAST POLICY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:00.967
WE'VE EFFECTIVELY SIDE -- THAT

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.202
IT IS NOT A PRIORITY TO HAVE

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.503
ENOUGH HOUSING FOR EVERYONE.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.439
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS -- THAT WE

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:08.741
KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO TURN

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:09.976
THIS AROUND AND THERE'S A LOT OF

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:10.876
WORK HAPPENING IN THE

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:13.512
LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR -- TO

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.247
INCREASE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING.

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.582
AT ALL INCOME LEVELS HI

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:20.219
INCLUDING SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FOR

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.587
LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND TO FIND IT.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:24.023
HOW TO PROTECT OU TENANTS TO

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:24.557
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:26.993
ACTUALLY STAY -- IN THE HOMES --

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:28.394
THAT THEY HAVE.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.062
WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:31.364
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.132
DO AND THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:35.067
NO ONE BILL OR OR NO ONE ISSUE

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:36.936
IS GOING TO FIX OUR HOUSING

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.672
CRISIS BUT ONE BUILDING BLOCK A

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:41.907
FOUNDATIONAL BUILDING BLOCK.

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:48.848
OR ON HOUSING ZONING -- BECAUSE

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:49.682
CAN HAVE ALL THE FUNDING FOR

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:50.883
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE WORLD

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.450
ALL THE STREAMLINING IN THE

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:52.018
WORLD BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:54.320
ILLEGAL TO BUILD THE HOUSING

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:55.388
BECAUSE OF ZONING.

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:56.322
THAT IT'S ALL FOR NAUGHT.

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.257
AND THE REALITY IS THAT IN 80%

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.359
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.595
IT IS ILLEGAL. TO BUILD ANYTHING

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:04.864
OTHER THAN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME --

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.399
IT'S TRUE IN 70% OF SAN

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:07.566
pFRANCISCO TO LEGAL BUILD

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:09.335
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SINGLE

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:10.903
FAMILY HOME OR TO UNIT SAME WITH

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.505
LOS ANGELES.

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:13.606
AND IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE IF

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:15.074
WE'RE GOING TO FILL THAT THREE

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:17.743
AND A HALF MILLION HOME --

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.911
DEFICIT.

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:20.379
THE QUESTION IS WHERE ARE WE

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:21.013
GOING TO BUILD THAT HOUSING --

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.314
AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BILL

THAT HOUSING WHERE THE JOBS ARE.

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.685
WHERE THERE'S TRANSIT AND TRY TO

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.921
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING A

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.523
AND A VERY SUSTAINABLE WAY AND

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:31.924
THAT'S WHAT SB FIFTY WILL ALLOW

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:34.927

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:39.932
TRANSPORTATION.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.868
AND THEN LATER DENSITY INCREASES

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:44.837
ELSEWHERE. TO FILL THAT THREE

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:46.972
AND A HALF MILLION HOME --

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.608

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:10.769
SERIES OF COMPLEX CHALLENGES

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.037
ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILD OUT OF

THAT'S FACING US.

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.337
AND WE MUST HAVE A LASER FOCUS

00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:47.039
ON THE BUILD OUT OF WORK FORCE

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:49.341
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN BIG CITIES

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:50.409

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:52.010
HERE'S WHY.

00:16:52.077 --> 00:16:53.512
AS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN

POINT FIVE MILLION AFFORDABLE

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:07.326
UNITS ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE.

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:08.627
THE STATE NEEDS TO DEVELOP A

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.129
PERMANENT REVENUE SOURCE TO HELP

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:12.164
SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF AFFORDABLE

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:14.800
HOUSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.135

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:22.508
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I WANT TO

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:41.860
THIS STRATEGY OF NO -- NO LONGER

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:43.862
WORKS.

00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:45.330
AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT WE

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:46.665
NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:47.933
UNIQUE DIFFERENCES OF

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.102
JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE AS THE

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:51.770
GOVERNOR SAID JUST LAST WEEK.

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:53.872
A BLANKET ONE SIZE FITS ALL

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:56.108
APPROACH SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:57.342
FOR EVERY COMMUNITY HERE IN

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.378

AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:09.354
NEEDS OF THE MANY SIZE

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:10.656

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:37.447
WE BELIEVE THAT THE SOLUTIONS TO

EXERCISING THEIR VOICES FULLY IN

OUR DEMOCRACY.

SIX MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:54.331
MARGINALIZED FOR DECADES IN OUR

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:56.166
HISTORY DEVELOP A PLAN FOR

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:58.302
EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT.

00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.870
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PASS THAT

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:01.538
PLAN THROUGH LOCAL NEGOTIATIONS

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:02.873
WITH MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS THIS

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:04.541
IS WHAT WE DO THIS IS OUR

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:06.143
ORGANIZATION'S EXPERIENCE.

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:09.046
TAKES FAR LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS.

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:11.348
AND REQUIRES LOCAL EMPOWERMENT

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:13.684
LOCAL SUPPORT AND RESOURCES AS

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:14.918
WELL AS SUPPORT WE AT THE STATE

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:15.919
LEVEL.

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:16.753
IT ALSO REQUIRES THOUGHTFUL

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.221
PLANNING FOR DEEPLY AFFORDABLE

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.757
HOUSING FOR COMMUNITIES THAT WE

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.826
SERVE BEING DISPLACED DOWN MASS

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.661
RIGHT NOW.

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:25.796
WE ALSO RETAIN DEEP CONCERNS

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:26.663
THAT THE OWNERS OF ENFORCING

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.265
ANTI DEMOLITION PROVISIONS WILL

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:30.334
FALL ON THESE ALREADY STRUGGLING

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.768
COMMUNITIES WERE BEARING THE

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:33.036
BRUNT OF EVICTION AND

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:35.672
DISPLACEMENT.

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:37.441
WE UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY

00:49:37.507 --> 00:49:39.409
BILL.

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:40.010
TWELVE SEVENTY NINE WHICH DOES

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:41.378
SOMETHING SIMILAR IT IDENTIFIES

00:49:41.445 --> 00:49:43.447
AND TARGETS JOBS RICH AREAS TO

00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:45.048
BUILD HOUSING COMMENSURATE TO

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:46.216
THE JOBS THEY CREATE.

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:47.451
IT'S SPECIFICALLY TACKLES THE

00:49:47.517 --> 00:49:50.887
LEGACIES OF EXCLUSIONARY ZONING --

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:52.556
BY TARGETING THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:49:52.622 --> 00:49:53.890
I HAVE TO SAY THAT IF THIS BILL

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:55.325
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:57.461
EXCLUSIONARY COMMUNITIES WHO

00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:58.061

SOLVE THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:00.797

POLICY AND ADVOCACY FOR THE

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.531
MISSION ECONOMIC.

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:36.099
DEVELOPMENT AGENCY HEADQUARTERED

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:37.601
IN SAN FRANCISCO'S MISSION

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:39.069
DISTRICT WHICH IS GROUND ZERO

00:50:39.136 --> 00:50:40.737
FOR GENTRIFICATION AND

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:42.506
DISPLACEMENT. ONE OF THE GROUND

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.241
ZEROES IN THIS COUNTRY AND

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:46.143
CERTAINLY A BIG GROUND ZERO FOR

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:47.144
CALIFORNIA.

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.578
I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S

00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:50.647
HAPPENING HERE WITH RESPECT TO

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.115
THE PUBLIC PROCESS I WHILE I

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:53.583
RESPECT THE WORK THAT THE

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.786
SENATORS HAVE DONE TO COME UP

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:58.321
WITH A COMPROMISE THAT SEEMS TO

00:50:58.388 --> 00:51:01.057
WORK FOR MOST -- NONE OF US

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:01.525
ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN THE

00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:02.325
AMENDMENTS.

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:04.428
IN FORM AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.696
CHANCE TO FULLY ANALYZE THEM AND

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:07.831
TO SEE WHERE THEY FIT INTO THE

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:09.766
EXISTING TAX OF THE MOST RECENT

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:11.401
VERSION OF SB FIFTY SO.

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:13.136
AS A WORD OF PROCESS I WOULD SAY

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:15.639
THAT WE NEED MORE CLARITY WE MAY

00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:17.007
NOT TRANSPARENCY MORE TIME TO BE

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:20.076
ABLE TO EVALUATE THE AMENDMENTS

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:21.511
AS BEING PROPOSED TODAY.

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:23.046
AND THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE THAT

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:25.081
LOOMS LARGE OVER THIS BILL AND

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.550
AND THAT IS IT EVERYONE EXPECTED

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:28.318
SB FIFTY IS GOING TO DELIVER

00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:30.987
HOUSING FOR A CALIFORNIANS AT

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:32.322
ALL INCOME LEVELS.

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:34.291
BUT WHEN WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:37.561
THE AFFORDABILITY ASPECTS OF SB

00:51:37.627 --> 00:51:39.696
FIFTY THE VAST MAJORITY OF SB

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:41.164
FIFTY HOUSING WILL BE MARKET

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:42.132
RATE HOUSING.

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:44.968
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT SB FIFTY

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.903
THE MOST CURRENT DRAFT BASICALLY

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.205
HAS NO AFFORDABILITY

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:50.207
REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDINGS THAT

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:51.708
ARE UNDER TEN YOU TEN UNITS ARE

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:52.642
UNDER.

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:54.211
I'M SO IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:51:54.277 --> 00:51:56.079
BUILDING A UNIVERSE OF FOUR

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:58.482
UNITS SMALL APARTMENT BUILDINGS

00:51:58.548 --> 00:51:59.983
HOW ARE WE GOING TO BUILD IN

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.887
AFFORDABILITY THERE BECAUSE AS

00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:04.621
CURRENTLY DRAFTED THOSE

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:05.288
BUILDINGS ARE COMPLETELY EXEMPT.

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:06.756
FROM ANY AFFORDABILITY MANDATE

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:10.093
UNDER SB -- FIFTY THIS IS A THIS

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.828
IS A VERY SWEEPING BILL AND

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:13.430
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT HOUSING

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:14.798
IS AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS US ALL.

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:16.466
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REZONING

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:18.668
THE ENTIRE STATE WITHOUT A STUDY.

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:20.871
AND I I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THAT

00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:23.173
THAT THAT THAT IS PRUDENT I

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.474
THINK THAT AS A STATE WE NEED TO

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:26.610
BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:27.944
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:29.279
GET TO A GOOD SOLUTION.

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:31.081
IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:32.716
WE'VE DONE IT THOUGHTFULLY AND

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:33.717
THAT WE HAVE AN HARM SENSITIVE

00:52:33.783 --> 00:52:34.718
COMMUNITIES LIKE THE MISSION

00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:36.186
DISTRICT WHICH IS ACTUALLY

TODAY.

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:03.960
WE OPPOSE SB FIFTY BECAUSE WE

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:06.196
BELIEVE IT WILL NOT DELIVER ON

00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:07.130
THE PROMISES OF ITS SPONSORS

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:07.530

IMPACTED COMMUNITIES IN

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:11.167
CALIFORNIA.

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:12.769
PUT DIFFERENTLY WE BELIEVE THAT

00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:14.270
SB FIFTY WILL FURTHER FUEL THE

00:56:14.337 --> 00:56:15.605
ENGINE OF GENTRIFICATION THAT IS

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:17.574
DISPLACING WORKING CLASS

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.074

CONTRIBUTING TO THE CRISES OF IT

00:56:21.644 --> 00:56:22.512
SHOULDN'T AFFECT AFFORDABILITY

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:23.646
AND TO THE SPECULATIVE FORCES

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:25.615
THAT DRIVE BOTH WE DO NOT

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.217
BELIEVE THE SB FIFTY AS A TOOL

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:28.585
FOR THE EMPOWERMENT WORKING IN

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:29.285

DISEMPOWERMENT.

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:34.424
OUR OPPOSITION TO THE SPECIFICS

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:36.726
OF THE BILL AS WE HAVE SO FAR

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:37.360
FALL INTO THREE DIFFERENT

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:38.194
CATEGORIES.

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:39.329
FIRST WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE

00:56:39.395 --> 00:56:40.430
AFFORDABILITY MANDATES IN THE

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:41.364
BILL ARE ANYWHERE NEAR

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:42.966
SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE SCALE OF

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:44.634
THE CHALLENGES FACING THE STATE

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:45.869
ALTHOUGH ALL OF KNOWLEDGE

00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:46.736

00:56:46.803 --> 00:56:48.772
MAINTENANCE ME TO THE BILL -- IN

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:50.473
FUTURE ABOUT THAT.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.441
WORD TO MEANINGFULLY IMPACT

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:52.242
DISAPPEAR SHORTFALL IN THE

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:53.610

HOUSING UNITS IN THE STATE OF

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.278
CALIFORNIA.

00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:57.213
SB FIFTY AS DRAFTED WILL ALMOST

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.381
CERTAINLY INDUCE THE NEED FOR

00:56:58.448 --> 00:56:59.582
EVEN FURTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:00.583
CONSTRUCTION.

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.851
OR FOR TRULY AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:03.419
WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY NEED IN

00:57:03.486 --> 00:57:04.320
OUR MAJOR CITIES.

00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:06.823
SECOND WE HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS AS

SB FIFTY IN EFFECT STREETS

00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:14.731

FIFTIES REQUIREMENTS AND IT

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:20.637
WOULD LOCK COMMUNITIES IN TO SB

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:21.204
FIFTY DEFAULTS.

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:22.472
IF THEY CANNOT PROPOSE

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:24.440
ALTERNATIVE PLANS TO AN ACT

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:25.742
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME A FRAMEWORK

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:27.510
THE SB FIFTY REQUIRES THIS IS

00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:33.850
UNACCEPTABLE WE ALSO HAVE

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:35.819
SERIOUS CONCERNS BY HOW

00:57:35.885 --> 00:57:36.419
SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES WILL BE

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:36.820
DETERMINED.

00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:37.720
RAISING CONCERNS OF THE FOR THE

ARE PRACTICALLY ENFORCEABLE AND

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:47.230
THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO SEE AS

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:48.798
MEANINGFUL PROTECTIONS AT ALL.

AND HONEST EFFORT BY A EXCELLENT

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.492
SENATOR.

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:25.227
WAS A MAN OF INTEGRITY DO NOT

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:26.495
THE STREETS HIS NAME BECAUSE

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:28.263
HE'S AS IDEAS THAT MAY NOT AGREE

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:30.465
WITH YOU BUT HE HAS THE GUTS TO

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.167
TRY HIS IDEAS.

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:34.202
I OPPOSE THOSE IDEAS BUT THAT'S

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:36.438
WHAT THIS DELIBERATION IS ABOUT

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.173
MR BOWERS IS HERE IS A MAN OF

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.374
GREAT INTEGRITY.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.442
AND GREAT STRENGTH IN THESE

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:42.310
PEOPLE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.246
TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM.

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:45.747
SO I JUST I WANT TO SAY THAT YOU

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:49.017
DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH HER.

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.519
AND THAT'S THE GENIUS OF THIS

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:52.854
PROCESS ON IT ALSO I HAVE NOT

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.689
BEEN SOMEONE I REPRESENT THE

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.892
CITY OF LOS ANGELES.

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.627
AND SINCE MR.

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:00.095
SINCE THE AUTHOR MISTER WEINER

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:01.630
IT INTRODUCES MEASURE LAST YEAR

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:02.864
I FELT.

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:06.067
A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY.

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:07.769
NOT TO BE SOMEBODY.

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:09.137
WHO JUST SAYS I DISAGREE WITH

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:10.772
HIS IDEA?

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:13.375
WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:15.877
THAT HE CORRECTLY NOTES HE'S

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.012
RIGHT.

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:18.547
I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE AS TO

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:20.515
THE REASONS FOR THE PROBLEMS BUT

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:22.484
WE CLEARLY HAVE A HOUSING ISSUE

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:23.885
THAT AFFECTS A MULTITUDE OF

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:24.853
FOLKS IN COMMUNITIES AND

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.655
AFFORDABILITY OBJECTIFICATION

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:28.657
AND PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:29.758
HOMELESS AND ALL OF THOSE ISSUES.

01:20:29.824 --> 01:20:30.959
THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:32.761
PROPER APPROACH.

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:34.162
AND SO I STARTED LAST YEAR IN

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:35.964
LOS ANGELES THAT I REPRESENTED A

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:37.299
HOMEWORK I DID MY OWN HOMEWORK I

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.533
SO I DON'T HAVE AN ABILITY TO

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.801
JUST SAY NO.

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:42.003
AND I ALSO PROMISED THE SENATOR

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.138
IT WHICH I THINK THE HONORABLE

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:44.372
THING TO DO BECAUSE WE WORK

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:45.607
TOGETHER ON SO MANY MATTERS I

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.142
WOULD DEMAGOGUE AGAINST HIS

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.410
MEASURE WHICH I HAVE NOT DONE.

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:49.978
MY PUBLIC POSITION IS I DID NOT

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:52.214
SUPPORT ITS CURRENT FORM AND I

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:52.781
DON'T SUPPORT NOW FOR MORE

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:54.049
REASONS.

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:55.083
SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO IT BEFORE

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:55.784
I ASKED HIM A COUPLE OF

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:56.985
QUESTIONS WHICH IS TO SHARE SOME

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.153
THINKING PUBLICLY WHICH I

01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.387
HAVEN'T DONE.

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:00.989
A BECAUSE I THINK THAT.

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:03.225
IT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THIS

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:04.492
THIS LARGER DEBATE.

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:06.261
MY ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL FROM THE

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:07.862
EAST SIDE OF LOS ANGELES FROM

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:10.932
HIGHLAND PARK TO BOYLE HEIGHTS

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:12.033
TO SOUTH LA SAID NO.

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.536
WHY WHY WHAT'S GOING ON THE

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:16.071
QUESTION IS A DEAR FRIEND OF

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:17.205
MINE OF MENTIONS TO SOME OF THE

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:18.039
AT THE COULD YOU COME TO MY

01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:18.873
OFFICE IS IN THE HIGH TECH

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.075
BUSINESS SAID?

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:21.309
DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.078
SOLUTION FALL IN LOVE WITH THE

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:24.246
PROBLEM.

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:25.513
THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO WE GET

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:26.481
MORE HOUSING.

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:27.849
BECAUSE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ONE

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:28.817
OF THE BIG REASONS WHEN ARNOLD

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:30.018
SCHWARZENEGGER WAS GOVERNOR I

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.353
WORKED ON THIS.

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:32.254
WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED BRADLEY

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.355
BURNS WITH AS AN INCENTIVE TO

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.257
BUILD BIG BOX RETAIL IN THE BILL

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:37.259
AUTO MALLS AND WE WANTED TO

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:38.793
REVERSE THAT WE DIDN'T WIN WE

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:39.628
CREATE INCENTIVE TO BUILD

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:40.328
HOUSING.

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:42.998
THERE'S A SERIES OF REASONS WHY

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:44.899
THAT'S THE CASE.

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:46.101
THERE'S AS TO WHY HOUSING AS MEN

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.402
BUILT IT'S NOT ECONOMICALLY

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:49.638
ADVANTAGES IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF

01:21:49.704 --> 01:21:51.506
OTHER REASONS IT'S IMPORTANT

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:53.275
WHEN WE DIAGNOSE THIS. TO

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:55.110
UNDERSTAND IN MY VIEW THAT IT'S

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:57.345
A LARGER S. THE LARGER ISSUE IN

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.748
THAT REGARD.

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:01.549
IN SO.

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.051
I LOOKED AT AND THINK THAT WHAT

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:04.052
GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS DOING IS

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:06.388
QUITE BRILLIANT.

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.089
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT SOME.

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:09.824
REAL ELBOW GREASE INTO IT WITH A

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:11.793
NUMBER OF INTERNS AND STAFF IN

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.395
MY OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES.

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:14.963
WHICH BASICALLY SAYS THE

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.865
GOVERNOR DID EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.633
THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THAT SAYS

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.168
LET'S LOOK AT STATE PROPERTY.

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:23.571
LET'S SEE.

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:25.674
HE'S IDENTIFIED FORTY FOUR

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:26.041
THOUSAND PIECES.

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:28.777
OF PROPERTY.

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:30.612
OF THAT HE'S IDENTIFIED THIRTEEN

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:31.680
HUNDRED AND THIRTY I THINK THAT

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:33.682
ACTUALLY COULD POTENTIALLY BE

01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:36.017
THE CASE BE AVAILABLE.

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:36.818
THE TEAM WOULD WHO WITH WHOM I

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:38.019
HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH IN THE

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:38.953
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.155
DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:41.256
DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB AND

01:22:41.323 --> 01:22:42.757
SCRUBBING THIS.

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:43.858
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS AN R.

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:45.360
BETTER THAN I ACTUALLY

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:46.895
ANTICIPATED IS THEY'RE LOOKING

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:49.097
AT THOSE PARCELS AND SAYING OKAY

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:49.631
WHICH ONES REALLY AREN'T

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:50.398
AVAILABLE?

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:52.033
WHICH ONES DO WORK FOR A NUMBER

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.068
OF OTHER REASONS THAT ARE

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:54.703
ENCUMBERED FOR OTHER RASONS

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:58.139
THEY'RE ALSO ENGAGE IN

01:22:58.206 --> 01:22:59.908
CONVERSATIONS THROUGH THE LOCAL

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:01.109
GOVERNMENT ENTITY CALIFORNIA

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:01.476
LEGAL CITIES.

01:23:01.543 --> 01:23:03.278
ASKING CITIES AND COUNTIES TO

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:04.546
SAY CAN WE HARSH TRADE OTHER

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:05.647
PROPERTIES THAT COULD BE GOOD

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.949
FOR HOUSING THAT WOULD WORK FOR

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:08.650
FOLKS.

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:10.318
BOMB THAT WE COULD TRADE WITH

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:11.619
YOU AND I'M TOLD THAT IN LAKE

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:13.121
COUNTY THERE'S A MILITARY

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:14.522
SURPLUS PROPERTY IT'S BEING

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:15.957
DISCUSSED I'M TOLD THAT THERE'S

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:17.559
A SIMILAR PROPERTY IN SANTA CRUZ.

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:20.161
I'VE MADE SIMILAR REQUESTS FOR

01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:20.695
PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF LOS

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:22.364
ANGELES IT'S NOT YOU KNOW AND

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:23.832
THE IDEA BEHIND WITH THE

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:25.333
GOVERNOR WANTS TO DO.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.601
IS THAT IF WE CAN IDENTIFY THIS

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:31.005
PROPERTY WHATEVER IT IS WE CAN A

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:32.507
SINCE WE OWN IT WE CAN LEASE IT

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:33.341
FOR A DOLLAR A YEAR SO LITTLE

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:34.275
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:35.677
WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDER THIS

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:37.245
PROPOSAL IS WE'RE GONNA INCREASE

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:39.114
LAND COSTS MY SIGNIFICANT OTHERS

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.315
PARENTS LIVE IN A HOUSE IN

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.383
HOLLYWOOD.

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:42.951
AND THEY PAID.

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:44.786
TAX DOLLARS AND NOW THEY WANT

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.087
TWENTY X. BECAUSE IT'S GOT

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.155
APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND MOS

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:47.822
LIKELY WANT TO TEAR IT DOWN WITH

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:48.857
AN APARTMENT BUILDINGS.

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.792
AND SO THEY'LL MAKE A WINDFALL

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.394
THAT'S GREAT BUT DOESN'T REALLY

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:53.862
SOLVE THE UNDERLYING

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:54.863
ARCHITECTURE THE PROBLEM IN

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.564
TERMS OF MONEY IF YOU CAN REDUCE

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:58.099
LAND COSTS HOW TO SOLVE THE

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.468
PROBLEM THREE THINGS ONE REDUCE

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:01.636
LAND COSTS.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:02.937
IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO THIS

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.973
ACROSS THE STATE FOR VERY FEW

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:06.474
DOLLARS ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:13.782
DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE ISSUE.

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:14.616
TOO IF YOU COULD EXPEDITE AS

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:15.650
UPSET AS BEFORE DOES TO SOME

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:16.484
EXTENT THE APPROVAL PROCESS ON

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:10.505
POLITICS.

01:25:10.572 --> 01:25:16.277
SO BOTTOM LINE IS.

01:25:16.344 --> 01:25:16.911

WITH WHICH THE WORKING SO IF IT

01:25:18.913 --> 01:25:20.548
IN TERMS OF THE DELIVERABLE OF

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:22.116
HOW DO WE BUILD FOUR MILLION

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:23.017
UNITS.

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:24.552
HOW DO WE MAKE THIS STUFF HAPPEN

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:25.820
ASQUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HOW DO WE

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:27.355
ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING COSTS THE

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:28.490
ISSUE OBJECTIFICATION

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:30.391
AFFORDABILITY IS DIRECTLY

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:32.060
RELATED TO COST BY CAN BUILD THE

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:33.595
PLACE TO COST ME FOUR HUNDRED

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:33.995
THOUSAND DOLLARS?

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:34.762
I CAN'T RENTED FOR A HUNDRED

01:25:34.829 --> 01:25:36.030
DOLLARS A MONTH IF I CAN BUILD A

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:37.332
PLACE TO COST FIFTY THOUSAND

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:38.933
DOLLARS I CAN RENT IT FOR LESS

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:39.634
MONEY.

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.035
SO YOU HAVE TO TREAD TRY TO DO

01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:42.770
THAT AND WHILE THIS IS AN

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:45.173
INTERESTING APPROACH AND I LOOK

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:45.907
AT THESE GUYS HAVE WORKED THEIR

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:47.509
HEARTS OUT -- THE ONLY OTHER

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:49.277
THINGS I WANT TO SHARE IS WHAT

01:25:49.344 --> 01:25:50.845
WE'VE DONE AND I'VE SEEN THIS IN

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:53.548
POLITICS I WAS ON THE PAYROLL IN

01:25:53.615 --> 01:25:54.148
THIS PLACE ONE MILE REAGAN WAS

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:54.649
GOVERNOR.

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:55.483
BROWN A LONG TIME AND SEEN A LOT

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:56.584
OF STUFF I DON'T KNOW IF I'M

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.486
RIGHT I JUST HAVE GOTTEN THE

01:25:58.553 --> 01:26:00.221
GUTS TO ASK QUESTIONS.

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:01.923
AND WHAT I LOOK AT HERE IS.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.024
THIS IS ONE OF THESE THINGS

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:03.992
WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET A

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:05.960
MEASURE THROUGH BUT WHAT WE'RE

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:06.694
WE HAVE WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.396
COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WE NOW

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:09.864
HAVE THIS AND MERGE APPROACHES

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:11.766
AS WELL FORTY THREE COUNTIES

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:14.302
HAVE. ONE FORTY FIVE COUNTIES

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:15.103
HAVE ONE RULE.

01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:16.404
THE FORTY FORTY THREE COUNTY

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:17.739
SOMEONE RULES AND FIFTEEN

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:19.474
COUNTIES OF ANOTHER RULE BECAUSE

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:20.675
THEY'RE SMALLER THAN.

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:21.309
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AT LEAST I

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:22.644
MAY BE WRONG ON THIS BUT MY

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:23.945
READING OF EXEMPTION OF COASTAL

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.114
ZONES MEANING THAT THIS THIS

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.649
RULE DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CITY

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:28.816
OF DEL MAR WHICH IS APPLIED TO

01:26:28.883 --> 01:26:30.385
THE CITY OF MALIBU.

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:31.753
IS THAT JUSTICE IS THAT RIGHT

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:33.388
CERTAINLY IT BEARS A QUESTION IN

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:35.356
TERMS OF THE EXEMPTION OF

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:36.991
COASTAL ZONES.

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.192
YOU KNOW CERTAIN THE BUS ROUTES

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:39.894
ARE ISSUES THE CHALLENGE ME

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:40.395
BECAUSE WE'RE BASICALLY

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:41.396
TRANSFERRING LAND USE POLICIES

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:43.431
TO THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES.

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:44.866
OF WHAT THEY DO I KNOW SOME OF

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:45.867
THE CORRECTIONS BUT I ONLY GOT

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:47.936
THIS EIGHT FORTY FIVE THIS MORE

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:48.503
EIGHT FIFTEEN THIS MORNING.

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:50.738
AND I HAD A CONVERSATION GOOD

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:51.306
CONVERSATION WITH THE GREAT

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:52.040
CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:53.841
TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON IT.

01:26:53.908 --> 01:26:56.678
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS.

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:57.278
YOU KNOW.

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:59.581
I AM I AM NOT SUPPORTING THIS BY

01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:00.982
ANY STRETCH IMAGINATION I HAVE

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:01.950
HELD QUIET BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT

01:27:02.016 --> 01:27:14.162
WAS RESPECTFUL TO MY COLLEAGUES.

01:27:14.228 --> 01:27:15.396
IT IN WORKING AN INSTITUTION

01:27:15.463 --> 01:27:15.997
LIKE THIS THIS IS HOW I WORK.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:16.798
I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:17.865
DEMAGOGUE AGAINST YOUR

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:18.466
COLLEAGUES IT'S IT'S STAND UP

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:19.534
FOR ISSUES BUT I JUST LOOK AT

01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:20.401
HOW THIS APPROACHES AND I SE

01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:21.569
THAT IS FROM MY POINT OF VIEW A

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:22.770
COBBLING TOGETHER OF A NUMBER OF

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:24.072
INTERESTS -- THAT DON'T REALLY

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:25.273
GET TO THE POINT THAT I TALK

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.909
ABOUT IN THAT THAT THE THIS.

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:28.643
A HIGH TECH PERSON SAYS FALL IN

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:29.243
LOVE WITH THE PROBLEM NOT THE

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:29.944
SOLUTION.

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:30.945
AND WE HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:32.947
THE SOLUTION AND TRY TO RE

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:35.750
JIGGER IT SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND

01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:38.119
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T WHAT WE

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:38.753
HAVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE ON THE

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.288
TABLE IS THERE SOME MEMBERS THAT

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:41.889
HAVE ABILITY. TO MOVE THE

01:27:41.956 --> 01:27:44.258
PROCESS QUICKLY WITH THE

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:45.793
GOVERNOR IS DOING IS ELEGANT.

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:48.062
ELEGANT AND SO TO ME BY ORDERS

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:49.864
OF MAGNITUDE HOW TO GET THINGS

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:51.799
DONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:54.802
WOULD BE -- TO UTILIZE THAT AND

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:55.803
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS OF

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:57.939
COURSE THAT'S NOT A BIG ENOUGH

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:58.406
SOLUTION.

01:27:58.473 --> 01:28:00.908
MR WE I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT BUT

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:02.710
THE IDEA OF AND I'M NOT A BIG

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:03.478
FAN IWAS CHAIRMAN THIS

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:05.980
COMMITTEE WAS SAID I AND AND THE

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:06.614
PEOPLE HAVE LEGAL CITIES KNOW

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:07.248
THAT I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF LOCAL

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:08.116
GOVERNMENT.

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:09.617
AND I THINK THEY DO A LOT OF

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:10.418
STUFF THAT'S WRONG A LOT OF

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:14.489
TIMES.

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:17.592
BUT BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:18.459
THE QUESTION IS THROWING OUT THE

01:28:18.526 --> 01:28:20.261
ZONING IN MY CITY AS YOU KNOW

01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:21.062
FROM CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD A

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.830
MISTER WINNER IT IS THIS IS A

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:24.565
VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION -- IN

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:26.034
LOS ANGELES HAS AGREED BAY CITY --

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:26.634
AND CERTAINLY THE COMMUNITIES

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:27.201
THAT I REPRESENT BUT BROUGHT

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:28.903
MORE BROADLY SPEAKING I'M I

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:29.937
THINK NOT JUST ABOUT THE SAN

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:31.039
FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH IS I

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:32.206
REPRESENT WITH EVERY BONE IN MY

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:33.074
BODY.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:34.609
BUT ALSO THE REST OF THE CITY

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:35.877
THAT I HAVE HAD GREAT EPERIENCE

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:37.412
WITH ALL AROUND THE PLACE AND

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.479
THE COUNTY.

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:40.748
AND SO YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT WHY

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:41.983
WHY THESE FOLKS HAVE DONE WHAT

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.217
THEY'VE DONE AND WHAT THEY SAID.

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:44.952
YEAH IT'S A TORTILLA OVER LOCAL

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:45.787
JURISDICTION YOUR NO QUESTION

01:28:45.853 --> 01:28:47.855
SIR THE QUESTION BUT I I DO

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:48.856
THINK THAT THERE'S A LARGER

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:51.125
DYNAMIC HERE THAT I DON'T THINK.

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:52.727
YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE SOLUTION

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:54.162
AND I THINK THAT WE'VE CREATED

01:28:54.228 --> 01:28:55.096
SO MANY MORE UNINTENDED

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.731
CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:57.665
THIS APPROACH.

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.434
ON THAT WE NEED TO TAKE IT BACK

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.868
TO THE DRAWING BOARD BUT

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:02.570
CONTINUE TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:04.605
AND I WILL CONTINUE SERVER

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:06.808
EASIER JUST ABOUT CLOSEST TO THE

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:07.942
HARDEST WORKING PERSON.

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:09.577
I THINK HE IS THE HARDEST

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:11.112
WORKING PERSON YOUR NUMBER --

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.280
TWO IN THIS BUILDING AND TO

01:29:12.346 --> 01:29:13.181
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU IN

01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:14.949
THAT REGARD BUT I WANT TO SHARE

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.284
MY THINKING AFTER I GOT AN

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.085
OPPORTUNITY TO READ ALL THIS

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:18.186
STUFF.

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:19.787
AND HAPPY TO HEAR ANY OTHER

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:21.322
RESPONSES BUT IT HAS BEEN A A

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:22.690
LOT OF HOMEWORK FOR ME AND IT'S

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:23.991
BEEN A LOT A LOT OF TIME.

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.159
AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:26.494
WORKING ON THIS IN MY COMMUNITY

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:28.629
WE HAVE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND SIX

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:29.664
HUNDRED UNITS ON THE ORANGE LINE

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:30.631
THAT WE PUT IN THE SAN FERNANDO

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:32.700
VALLEY SO WE HAVE RESPONDED IN A

01:29:32.767 --> 01:29:34.268
VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY TO TRANCE

BECAUSE YOUR CITY AND MY CITY

NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:00.368
OVER A PERIOD OF DECADES WHERE

WE WERE BUILDING VERY LITTLE NEW

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:03.738
HOUSING.

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:05.439
DISPLACEMENT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:07.708
GET PUSHED OUT BECAUSE HOUSING

01:34:07.775 --> 01:34:09.276
COSTS GO THROUGH THE ROOF.

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:10.444
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE EOUGH

AT ANY POINT IN THE LAST SEVEN

01:34:28.396 --> 01:34:29.263
YEARS.

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.998
THE NOT BUILDING COULD NOT BE

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:33.067
TORN DOWN TO BUILD IN SB FIFTY

01:34:33.134 --> 01:34:35.136
PROJECT EVEN IF THE LOCAL CITY

01:34:35.202 --> 01:34:36.637
GOVERNMENT WOULD ALLOW IT.

01:34:36.704 --> 01:34:37.538
IF THERE'S BEEN AN ALLIS

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:40.074

AND I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO MAKING

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:51.085
SURE NOT TO PLACING PEOPLE THIS

01:34:51.152 --> 01:34:53.154
IS ABOUT ADDING NEW HOUSING NOT

01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.056
REPLACING RESIDENTS WHO ARE

01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:59.326

TWO SEVEN AROUND BUS STOPS

01:35:51.512 --> 01:35:52.880
TRIGGERED A HEIGHT INCREASE

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:54.315
ABOVE LOCAL HEIGHT LIMITS.

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:55.716
WE THEN IN THE NEW VERSION OF

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:56.550
THE BILL.

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:57.785
BOTH ARE IN THE JOBS RICH

01:35:57.852 --> 01:35:59.553
CLASSIFICATION AT AROUND BUS

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.187
STOPS.

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:01.822
THE LOCAL HEIGHT LIMIT IS

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:03.724
RESPECTED SO IN THE JOB RICH

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.459
AREAS THE LOCAL HEIGHT LIMIT

01:36:05.526 --> 01:36:07.461
APPLIES LOCAL SETBACK RULES

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:07.995
APPLY.

01:36:08.062 --> 01:36:10.798
LOCAL DESIGN STANDARDS APPLY

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:12.233
LOCAL DEMOLITION RULES.

01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:15.402
APPLY LOCAL INCLUSIONARY APPLIES

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:16.871
LOCAL IMPACT FEES.

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:20.107
APPLY AND SO FOR THE MOST PART

01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:21.642
THE LOCAL CRUCIAL PROCESS

01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:22.776
APPLIES.

01:36:22.843 --> 01:36:25.212
SO FOR THE MOST PART LOCAL RULES

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:26.814
WILL STILL APPLY.

01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:28.215
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:29.950
THIS BILL DOES NOT TRIGGER A

01:36:30.017 --> 01:36:32.720
HIGH INCREASE -- IT DIFFERS TO

01:36:32.786 --> 01:36:34.421
LOCAL HEARTS SO YES IT WILL

01:36:34.488 --> 01:36:36.657
ALLOW THESE SMALL MULTI UNIT

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.592
BUILDINGS BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT

01:36:38.659 --> 01:36:40.828
PUTTING YOU KNOW SKYSCRAPERS AND

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:42.062
MEMBERS THE OTHER THING I WILL

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:42.997
SAY IS.

01:36:43.063 --> 01:36:44.165
AND THIS DIFFERENT PEOPLE TAKE

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:46.600
THIS DIFFERENTLY -- I THINK

01:36:46.667 --> 01:36:47.668
SOMETIMES.

01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:49.103
PEOPLE I WHEN I LISTEN TO TO

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:50.137
SOME PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:51.939
BILL IT'S AS IF THE GOVERNOR

01:36:52.006 --> 01:36:53.974
SIGNS THE BILL IF YOU KNOW IF

01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:55.042
THAT HAPPENS IF WE GET THERE.

01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:57.111
HE SIGNS IT AND THE NEXT DAY

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:58.245
APARTMENT BUILDING START

01:36:58.312 --> 01:36:59.780
DSCENDING FROM THE SKY IN THE

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:01.048
PEOPLE'S NEIGHBORHOODS WELL

01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:02.116
THAT'S NOT HELD A BILL IN THE

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:04.385
WORKS DEVELOPMENT IS SLOW EVEN

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:06.453
WHEN YOU'RE IN A IN A PROCESS OR

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.922
IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:09.190
FAVORABLE.

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:10.191
AND SO THIS IS GOING TO GIVE

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:11.592
THEMAN AVAILABLE PARCEL

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:22.303
DEVELOPER WHO IS FUNDING GO

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:22.870
THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS

01:37:22.937 --> 01:37:23.771
IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS AND

01:37:23.837 --> 01:37:25.639
FRANKLY DECADES -- TO SEE REALLY

01:37:25.706 --> 01:37:26.373
REALLY SIGNIFICANT.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.141
ANY KIND OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:28.742
A VERY GRADUAL THING OVER TIME.

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:31.178
THE THIRD QUESTION IS A STUDY.

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:31.946
I MENTIONED A FEW TIMES YOU'RE

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:32.713
DOING THIS WITHOUT A STUDY WOULD

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:33.347
YOU COMMENT ON THAT THERE HAVE

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:33.547
BEEN.

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:34.315
MORE STUDIES ABOUT HOUSING IN

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:35.349
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEN WE

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:36.717
COULD PROBABLY FIT IN THIS ROOM

01:37:36.784 --> 01:37:38.385
IF WE STOCKTON FROM FLOOR TO

01:37:38.452 --> 01:37:39.420
CEILING.

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:41.455
STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN AS I

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:42.556
MENTIONED THE THREE AND A HALF

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:44.124
MILLION HOME DEFICIT STUDIES

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:45.893
HAVE SHOWN THAT RESTRICTIVE

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.895
ZONING IN CALIFORNIA PLACES A

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:50.631
VERY HARSH COP ON OUR ABILITY.

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:53.200
TO CLOSE THAT -- BACK OUT OF

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:54.602
STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:56.337
RESTRICTIVE ZONING LEADS TO

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:58.539
SPRAWL SO THAT MORE MORE HOUSING

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.975
GETS PUSHED INTO FARMLANDS --

01:38:01.041 --> 01:38:02.743
AND FAR FAR AWAY CLOGGING UPPER

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:05.312
FREEWAYS -- STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:06.914
THAT RESTRICTIVE ZONING MAKES

01:38:06.981 --> 01:38:09.350
COMMUNITIES LESS DIVERSE BECAUSE

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:10.784
IT BANS AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:14.154
ABOUNDS APARTMENT BUILDINGS WE

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:15.322
HAVE.

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:16.624
MORE STUDIES NO WE COULD EVER

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:18.459
NEED -- WE HAVE ALL THE DATA WE

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:19.927
NEED AND NOW WHICH IS IN THE

01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:21.495
POLITICAL WILL TO EXECUTE ON THE

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:22.930
SOLUTION.

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:24.231
LAST QUESTION IS -- THE CITY OF

01:38:24.298 --> 01:38:27.067
PASADENA SAID WE HAVE BEEN DOING.

01:38:27.134 --> 01:38:31.972
X. Y. Z. AND THEREFORE WE YOU

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:32.840
KNOW WHAT.

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:33.440
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE REBELLING

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:34.975
ABOUT.

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:35.576
WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING WE MAY

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:36.944
SUE?

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:38.479
I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE'S A A

01:38:38.545 --> 01:38:40.347
PROVISION THAT SAYS.

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:44.618
THANK YOU FOR PRIOR EFFORTS.

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:48.455
YOU'VE MET THE CRITERIA WE HAVE

01:38:48.522 --> 01:38:49.757
YOU JUST RESPONSE IT FOR ANYONE

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:51.158
TO FILE A LAWSUIT WE KNOW THE

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.459
HUNTINGTON BEACH IS ALREADY

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:53.961
SUING THE STATE REPEATEDLY

01:38:54.028 --> 01:38:56.630
TRYING TO OVERTURN THE SB THIRTY

01:38:56.697 --> 01:38:57.698
FIVE THAT I AUTHORED TWO YEARS

01:38:57.765 --> 01:38:58.299
AGO.

01:38:58.365 --> 01:38:59.733
THERE HOUSING IS AN ISSUE

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.735
STATEWIDE CONCERN AND SO I I

01:39:01.802 --> 01:39:03.704
DON'T BELIEVE THE LAWSUIT HAMMER

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:04.972
BUT ANYONE COMPILERS SUIT.

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:06.106
YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:08.242
PASADENA SAID AND I APPLAUD ANY

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:09.310
CITY IN THERE ARE PLENTY OF

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:10.644
CITIES THAT ARE AT THEIR CITIES

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.446
THAT ARE REALLY MAKING GOOD

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:14.081
FAITH EFFORTS TO BUILD HOUSING.

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:15.716
I THINK THAT SOMETIMES IN THESE

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:18.385
HOUSING THE BATES -- WE ARE

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:20.521
QUICKLY PEOPLE START DEMONIZING

01:39:20.587 --> 01:39:22.122
LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE CITY

01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:24.358
COUNCIL MEMBERS -- AND I KNOW

01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:26.060
MANY MANY CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.528
ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND

01:39:27.594 --> 01:39:29.029
OVERWHELMINGLY THESE ARE.

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:30.364
GOOD HARD WORKING COMMITTED

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:32.966
PEOPLE RUN FOR OFFICE FOR ALL

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:35.836
THE RIGHT REASONS AND THEY WANT

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:36.603
TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY AND

01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:38.605
THEY GET PAID VERY LITTLE AND

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:39.907
THEY GET YELLED OUT AT THE

01:39:39.973 --> 01:39:41.709
SUPERMARKET AND IT'S YOU KNOW.

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:43.143
IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE MOST FUN JOB

01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:44.511
IN THE WORLD BUT THEY'RE DOING

01:39:44.578 --> 01:39:45.846
IT BECAUSE THEY'RE COMMITTED --

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:48.015
BUT WE HAVE CREATED A SYSTEM

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:49.450
THAT HAS SET CITIES OUGHT TO

01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:51.552
FAIL BOTH FIRST TAXES STRUCTURE

01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:52.486
REASONS.

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:54.822
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE SET ME

01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:56.590
VERY FEW STATE RULES IN THE ONCE

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:58.025
WE SET OUR UNENFORCEABLE AND WE

01:39:58.092 --> 01:39:59.860
EXPECT CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS TO

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.595
WALK THE PLANK EVERY WEEK VOTE

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:02.329
FOR PROJECTS.%

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:03.897
AND RISK THEIR OWN POLITICAL

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:04.798
FUTURE.

01:40:04.865 --> 01:40:06.367
ON THIS IS NOT WHAT WE NEED TO

01:40:06.433 --> 01:40:07.901
GET AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF THE

01:40:07.968 --> 01:40:09.636
BAD ACTORS CITIES AND THE GOOD

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:10.738
ACTORS CITIES.

01:40:10.804 --> 01:40:12.206
AND YOU PUT THE HOUSING IN THE

01:40:12.272 --> 01:40:14.575
IN THE NAUGHTY BAD ACTORS CITIES

01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:16.443
AND FOR THE GOOD ACTORS CITIES

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:17.745
THEY GOT A BENEFIT OF NO HOUSING --

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:19.113
WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:20.681
NOTION THAT HOUSING IS SOME SOME

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.282
HELP PUNISHMENT.

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:23.417
RIGHT WE'RE GONNA IF YOU'RE BAD

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:25.052
AND AUDIENCES CITY WERE GOING TO

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:26.553
PUNISH YOU WITH MORE HOUSING AND

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.422
IF YOU'RE GOOD WE'RE GOING TO

01:40:28.489 --> 01:40:35.496
REWARD YOU BY NOT HAVING.

01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:36.897
MORE HOUSING THERE.

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:38.532
I HOUSING IS A BENEFIT.

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:39.500
AND WHAT BIG PICTURE WE HAVE

01:40:39.566 --> 01:40:40.501
THIS MASSIVE HOUSING DEFICIT AND

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:42.236
THE QUESTION IS NOT WHO'S BEEN

01:40:42.302 --> 01:40:42.703
GOOD WHO'S BEEN BAD.

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:43.570
BUT TO ADD THESE HOMES THAT WE

01:40:43.637 --> 01:40:45.406
NEED WHERE DO WE NEED TO PUT

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:47.608
THEM TO BE SUSTAINABLE NEAR JOBS

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.676
YOU'RE TRANSIT -- SO THAT'S HOW

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:52.379
I LOOK AT IT -- A AND AYE AYE

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:54.982
THAT'S TO BE THE BEST APPROACH

01:40:55.048 --> 01:40:56.216
THANK YOU MISTER CENTER WINNER

01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:57.851

TO THE SENATOR.

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:13.467
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ABOUT

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:14.301
THE STUDIES SO.

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:15.402
REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:18.238
HERE IS THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US

01:41:18.305 --> 01:41:19.473
AND DO WE KNOW WHETHER THE

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.009
PROPOSAL BEFORE US IS REALLY THE

01:41:22.075 --> 01:41:22.476
RIGHT.

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:25.045
ROUTE TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE NEED

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:25.846
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:41:25.913 --> 01:41:27.281
THERE MAY BE NUMEROUS STUDIES

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:29.249
BUT HAS ANYONE LOOKED AT THIS

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:30.684
PARTICULAR BILL AT THE

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:31.852

TABLE. TO SAY THIS IS THE RIGHT

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:37.758
APPROACH THAT SAID HE HAS NOT

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:38.292
BEEN DONE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE

01:41:38.358 --> 01:41:38.592

LOOK AT THAT THE PROBLEM OF

01:41:46.033 --> 01:41:47.701
DEMOLITIONS IN CALIFORNIA BUT I

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.736
HAVE TO SAY IS A TENANT ADVOCATE --

01:41:49.803 --> 01:41:51.271
THAT WE SEE DEMOLITION AS A

01:41:51.338 --> 01:41:53.440
BRAMPTON ISSUE EVEN IN PLACES

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:02.316
RELATIVELY STRONG DEMOLITION

01:42:02.382 --> 01:42:03.784
PROTECTIONS I IN MY PRIVATE

01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:05.552
CAPACITY WAS JUST ORGANIZING

01:42:05.619 --> 01:42:06.987
WITH A BUNCH OF TENANTS HIS

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:08.188
ENTIRE BUILDING WAS DE

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:10.023
CONTROLLED -- BECAUSE OF

01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:11.492
RENOVATIONS WE SEE RENT

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:13.093
EVICTIONS BASICALLY LIKE

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.229
EVICTION SLASH RENOVATION AS A

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:16.897
PRETEXT TO GET LOW INCOME

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:19.700
TENANTS IS IN OUT OUT OF HOUSING --

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:21.235
AND SO WHILE THE ELLIS ACT

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:23.170
INTENDANT EXEMPTION PROVISIONS

01:42:23.237 --> 01:42:25.339
LOOK EXCELLENT ON PAPER THEY ARE

01:42:25.405 --> 01:42:29.076
VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE -- AND

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:31.111
THE OWNERS WOULD STILL LARGELY

01:42:31.178 --> 01:42:33.380
BE ON TEN ORGANIZATIONS OUT

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:34.581
WHICH IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:36.583
LIKE TEN ORGANIZATIONS WERE

01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:38.051
UNDERFUNDED UNDER RESOURCE THE

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:39.520
COMMUNITIES THAT THE SATURDAYS

01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:40.854
EASTER BASIN ARE THE ONES

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:41.989
FIGHTING THE DISPLACEMENT OF

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.123
ACTION THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY'RE

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:44.625
FIGHTING THESE DEMOLITIONS.

01:42:44.691 --> 01:42:46.560
AND WHAT THIS PROVISION DOESN'T

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.562
REALLY CHANGES THE FACT THAT BY

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:50.564
THAT TIME THE THE BOTH THE SHIP

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:52.065
IS ALREADY SAILED.

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:52.900
THE TRAINS ROLLED OUT OF THE

01:42:52.966 --> 01:42:55.235

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:56.370
DEMOLITION OR AND ALICE

ACTIVATION OR SOMETHING THAT HAS

01:42:57.971 --> 01:42:58.839
HAPPENED.

01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:00.574
I STILL HAVE SERIOUS QUESTIONS

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:02.509
ABOUT HOW THIS PROVISION IS

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:03.911

DEMOLISH EXISTING RENTAL HOUSING

01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:17.524
AND REDEVELOPMENT.

YOUR POINT THAT YOU MADE EXACTLY

01:43:21.828 --> 01:43:23.263
WHAT -- CENTER MORLOCK SAID WAS

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:28.368
CENTER WIENER THAT WE'VE SEEN IS

PROBABLY READ QUARTER OF SOME --

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:34.675
BUT THAT IS THE QUESTION A STUDY

01:43:34.741 --> 01:43:36.677
GIVEN HOW BIG THIS IS HOW BIG

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:38.278
THIS ENDEAVOR IS.

01:43:38.345 --> 01:43:39.846
IF YOU LITERALLY THIS GETS

01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:41.515
ENACTED IT WON'T BE THE LAW TO

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:43.450
JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND AND

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:44.751
TWENTY OKAY.

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:46.253
IF WE COULD CREATE A SITUATION

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:46.920
SAYS LET'S LOOK AT THIS

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:49.289
PARTICULAR OF WHAT THESE DO

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:50.524

01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:13.820
AND PEOPLE OF ALL INCOME MALES

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:15.222
IN A DIVERSE COMMUNITY THAT LIVE

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:17.557
AROUND THAT TRANSIT THAT'S WHAT

01:48:17.624 --> 01:48:20.126
WE HAVE TO INSIST ON SB FIVE

01:48:20.193 --> 01:48:21.194
WOULD PROVIDE THE FINANCING AND

01:48:21.261 --> 01:48:23.830
OTHER BILLS -- WE'LL SEE WHAT

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:25.565
THE GOVERNOR DOES IN HIS BUDGET

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:27.200
AND I'M GONNA TELL GOVERNOR.

01:48:27.267 --> 01:48:29.569
THAT WE CANNOT HAVE A PACKAGE ON

01:48:29.636 --> 01:48:31.671
HOUSING LEGISLATION UNLESS THE

01:48:31.738 --> 01:48:33.240
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:33.306 --> 01:48:34.341
APPROVED.

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:37.277
AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:39.012
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:40.747
IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IF THE

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.716
GOVERNOR DOES NOT GOAL IF YOU

01:48:42.782 --> 01:48:44.451
JUST CONTINUES WITH THE ONE TIME

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:47.120
ONLY SOURCE OF FUNDS.

01:48:47.187 --> 01:48:49.155
THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE IF WE DO

01:48:49.222 --> 01:48:50.824
THESE KINDS OF BILLS.

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:53.526
NOT APPROPRIATE.

01:48:53.593 --> 01:48:55.195
IT'S NOT THE CORRECT THING TO DO --

01:48:55.262 --> 01:48:57.364
I SUPPORT SB SIX AND THAT'S

01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:58.999
INCLUDING AND I THINK WE'RE

01:48:59.065 --> 01:48:59.900
SEEING GOOD SCIENCE FROM THE

01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:01.668
GOVERNOR THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:49:01.735 --> 01:49:03.370
IDENTIFIED LAN.

01:49:03.436 --> 01:49:05.105
AND PERHAPS RATHER THAN

01:49:05.171 --> 01:49:06.506
DISPLACING.

01:49:06.573 --> 01:49:08.842
HOUSING WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT

01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:10.844
THINGS LIKE GOD WITH THE HELP OF

01:49:10.911 --> 01:49:11.711
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:14.114
VACANT -- PARKING LOTS A LONG

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:16.082
STRIP COMMERCIAL AREAS THAT ARE

01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.549
VACANT.

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:18.151
UNDER UTILIZED PROPERTY AS

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:19.786
OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT WHERE

01:49:19.853 --> 01:49:23.123
THERE'S A APARTMENT COMPLEX.

01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:25.325
THAT WE WOULD HAVE A LOT OF

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:26.860
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE DON'T WANT

01:49:26.927 --> 01:49:28.028
TO RIP DOWN THE APARTMENT

01:49:28.094 --> 01:49:29.996
COMPLEX.

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:31.698
AS OPPOSED TO BUILDING ON DOWN

01:49:31.765 --> 01:49:32.999
THE BLOCK A VACANT PIECE OF

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:34.467
PROPERTY.

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:36.670
AND THAT WOULD TAKE HELP.

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:39.306
AND ASSISTANCE FROM THE

01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:40.206
COMMUNITY.

01:49:40.273 --> 01:49:42.275
AND THE PLANNING DEPARTMENTS OF

01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:44.110
THE CITIES ARE SO IMPORTANT TO

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:45.345
MAKE IN THAT WORK THE PLANE

01:49:45.412 --> 01:49:47.480
DEPARTMENTS DAVID REYES TALKED

01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:49.716
ABOUT IT FROM PASADENA.

01:49:49.783 --> 01:49:51.952
THE THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER.

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:53.520
WE HAVE TO HAVE GOOD PLANNING.

01:49:53.586 --> 01:49:54.854
GOOD PLANNING HOUSE TO BE PART

01:49:54.921 --> 01:49:56.356
OF THE PROCESS.

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:57.757
WE DON'T HVE GOOD PLANNING.

01:49:57.824 --> 01:50:00.694
OF LONG TERM -- NONE OF WHAT

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.561
WE'RE DOING TODAY IS GOING TO

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:03.797
MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO WE HAVE TO

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:04.731
SUPPORT GOOD PLANNING

01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:05.031
[inaudible]

01:50:05.098 --> 01:50:10.203
AND THIS IS A LONG TERM ISSUE --

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:12.072
WE ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE THE

01:50:12.138 --> 01:50:14.674
DYNAMIC OF FISCAL ZONING.

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:16.543
YOU KNOW THE PLAN DEPARTMENT

01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:18.545
WORKS FOR THE CITY MANAGER.

01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:20.714
CITY MANAGERS AND THE CITY -- IT

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:22.449
MINISTRATIONS.

01:50:22.515 --> 01:50:23.917
ARE LOOKING AT YOUR BUDGET EVERY

01:50:23.984 --> 01:50:25.652
YEAR AND THEY WANT LAND USES

01:50:25.719 --> 01:50:26.319
THAT.

01:50:26.386 --> 01:50:28.788
THE GENERATE TAX INCOME.

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:30.824
TAX INCOME OR OR REVENUE

01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:32.826
GENERATED OF LAND USE POLICIES

01:50:32.892 --> 01:50:34.227
THAT.

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.729
THAT ARE NOT IN WRITING BUT

01:50:35.795 --> 01:50:36.763
ACTUALLY ARE WHAT ACTUALLY

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:37.931
HAPPENS.

01:50:37.998 --> 01:50:40.166
STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR

01:50:40.233 --> 01:50:42.335
THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE.

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:44.804
GENERATING A LOT OF JOBS IN TAX

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:47.140
REVENUE AS OPPOSED TO JAY IT'S A

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:49.509
HOUSING PROJECT AS AFFORDABLE.

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:50.910
THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE.

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:52.612
INAPPROPRIATE FROM A MORAL

01:50:52.679 --> 01:50:53.346
STANDPOINT.

01:50:53.413 --> 01:50:55.281
AND AND I THINK FROM THE LONG

01:50:55.348 --> 01:50:57.117
TERM STATE FISCAL STANDPOINT FOR

01:50:57.183 --> 01:50:59.319
OUR COMMUNITY WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:00.620
PRIORITIES SET STRAIGHT.

01:51:00.687 --> 01:51:02.522
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS TO

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:05.125
PRIORITY NOT THOSE LAND USES A

01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:07.160
CREATE A LOT OF JOBS WITHOUT

01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:11.131
HOUSING IS THEY JUST MAKE THE

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:12.332
PROBLEM WORSE.

01:51:12.399 --> 01:51:13.333
ME AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO STATE

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:15.568
TENET PROTECTIONS AND DISPLACED

01:51:15.635 --> 01:51:17.570
ANTI DISPLACEMENT LAWS.

01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:19.172
IN THE SENATE PACKAGE I DON'T

01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:21.241
SEE THOSE KINDS OF PROPOSALS AS

01:51:21.307 --> 01:51:23.476
MUCH WE HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR

01:51:23.543 --> 01:51:24.577
ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES ON THEIR

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:25.712
BILLS.

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:27.313
AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BILLS

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:29.916
ARE SUPPORTED BY THE LEGISLATURE.

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:32.352
AND NAM SUPPORT THOSE TENANTS --

01:51:32.419 --> 01:51:34.621
DISPLACEMENTS TENSE RIGHTS BILLS

01:51:34.687 --> 01:51:36.589
RENT CONTROL BILLS WE HAVE TO

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:37.624
LOOK AT ALL THAT.

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:38.958
AS A SOLUTION TO AFFORDABLE

01:51:39.025 --> 01:51:42.095
HOUSING SO I SEE THIS IS A

01:51:42.162 --> 01:51:44.330
PACKAGE MISTER GERMAN -- I WANT

01:51:44.397 --> 01:51:45.532
TO INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY IN THE

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:47.767
IN THE CONCEPT OF A PACKAGE.

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:49.436
AND IF WE DON'T HAVE A PACKAGE

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:51.805
OF THIS BILL IN THE OTHER BILLS.

01:51:51.871 --> 01:51:53.339
OF I DON'T THINK IT'S A

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:56.509
SUCCESSFUL EFFORT THIS YEAR'S SO.

01:51:56.576 --> 01:51:57.744

01:51:59.446 --> 01:52:02.415
IF THERE'S NOT A PACKAGE OF WILL

01:52:02.482 --> 01:52:04.017
CONTINUE HAVE CONFLICTS.

01:52:04.084 --> 01:52:05.485
AND WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:06.853
TRY TO CREATE A PACKAGE AND I

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.455
I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ALL

01:52:08.521 --> 01:52:09.722
SIDES ON THE QUESTION.

01:52:09.789 --> 01:52:11.424
ON THIS ISSUE AND PULL EVERYBODY

01:52:11.491 --> 01:52:12.625

01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:18.465
WITH THAT I'M I'M -- COMMITTED.

01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:21.768
AND WE CAN WE CAN DO THIS WE

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:23.937
CAN'T CREATE A A GOOD -- PACKAGE

01:52:24.003 --> 01:52:25.505
INVOLVING ALL THESE ELEMENTS

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:26.506
THAT I MENTIONED.

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:27.974
AND I I ACTUALLY I I FEEL I

01:52:28.041 --> 01:52:29.876
PROBABLY MISS ON TOM AND THE

01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:31.511
REASON I PROBABLY MISSED SOME IS

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:33.646
BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE

01:52:33.713 --> 01:52:35.482
IDEAS FROM EVERYBODY ABOUT HOW

01:52:35.548 --> 01:52:37.517
WE CAN PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE

01:52:37.584 --> 01:52:39.152
HOUSING.

01:52:39.219 --> 01:52:40.553
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT THING -- WE

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:42.222
SHOULD NOT USE CONFLICTING

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:45.158
STATEMENTS ON ON EACH OTHER.

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:47.794
I HOPE THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T --

01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:49.929
CREATE ANTAGONISTIC STATEMENTS

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:51.931
ON THE SUBJECT I THINK WE OUGHT

01:52:51.998 --> 01:52:53.700
TO WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:55.435
WORK TOGETHER WE HAVE.

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:57.704

01:52:59.672 --> 01:53:02.075
EFFORT -- TO TO DO THAT AND YOU

01:53:11.518 --> 01:53:14.487

BE SUCCESSFUL SO.

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:18.691
IF WE'RE NOT DOING THINGS TO

01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:20.727
RESPECT ONE ANOTHER THAT WILL

01:53:20.793 --> 01:53:22.162
INHIBIT.

01:53:22.228 --> 01:53:23.596
THE KIND OF COALITION PACKAGE

FOR MANY YEARS BUT IT APPEARS TO

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.889

MASSES OF PEOPLE MOVING OUT.

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.682
OF THE AREAS WHERE THEY CANNOT

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:18.184
AFFORD TO LIVE.

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:19.352

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:19.586
TRANSIT.

01:54:19.652 --> 01:54:22.021

AND VERY PARTICULARLY.

01:54:40.707 --> 01:54:41.374
OUR HOUSING PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN

01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:44.110
EXACERBATED OVER DECADES BY THE

01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:46.112
STATE LEGISLATURE IMPOSING

01:54:46.179 --> 01:54:47.213
ITSELF.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.016
AND ITS WILL ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:51.584

DID NOT SUPPORT.

02:22:03.081 --> 02:22:03.581
EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN AS I WAS

02:22:03.648 --> 02:22:05.416
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT A ONE

02:22:05.483 --> 02:22:08.486
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH.

02:22:08.553 --> 02:22:10.288
IN CANDIDLY WHAT WORKS FOR

02:22:10.355 --> 02:22:12.257
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.

02:22:12.323 --> 02:22:15.593
DOESN'T WORK FOR A COUNTY OF SIX

02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:17.896
HUNDRED THOUSAND OR LESS.

02:22:17.962 --> 02:22:19.364
CAN I ASK THE SERGEANTS IF WE

02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:35.880
COULD PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR

02:22:43.488 --> 02:22:43.554

02:22:43.554 --> 02:22:46.991
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:22:47.058 --> 02:22:48.793
AS I WAS SAYING WHAT WORKS FOR

02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:51.562
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES OR A CITY

02:22:51.629 --> 02:22:53.564
OF FOUR MILLION DOESN'T WORK

02:22:53.631 --> 02:22:56.034
NECESSARILY FOR A COUNTY OF A

02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:58.836
POPULATION. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:22:58.903 --> 02:22:59.537
FOLKS OR LEX.

02:22:59.604 --> 02:23:02.707
AND I'M ALSO A BELIEVER THAT NO

02:23:02.774 --> 02:23:04.542
COMMUNITY SHOULD SEE DRAMATIC

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:07.178
CHANGE BUT EVERY COMMUNITY

02:23:07.245 --> 02:23:08.646
SHOULD SEE SOME CHANGE.

02:23:08.713 --> 02:23:10.815
I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS

02:23:10.882 --> 02:23:13.418
TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE.

02:23:13.484 --> 02:23:14.585
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS NOT A

02:23:14.652 --> 02:23:17.789
SILVER BULLET. TO BE ABLE TO

02:23:17.855 --> 02:23:19.090
SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS.

02:23:19.157 --> 02:23:20.291
WE HAVE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS

02:23:20.358 --> 02:23:22.026
MOVING RIGHT NOW OVER THE NEXT

02:23:22.093 --> 02:23:23.761
FIVE YEARS IN ONE TIME

02:23:23.828 --> 02:23:25.530
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS.

02:23:25.596 --> 02:23:27.532
AND WE NEED A PERMANENT ONGOING

02:23:27.598 --> 02:23:28.967
SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:23:29.033 --> 02:23:31.502
WHICH IS WHY IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

02:23:31.569 --> 02:23:31.736
TO PASS.

02:23:31.803 --> 02:23:34.305
SB.

02:23:34.372 --> 02:23:35.540
FIVE OUR REAL CRISIS IN THIS

02:23:35.606 --> 02:23:37.141
STATE EXISTS.

02:23:37.208 --> 02:23:39.377
WHEN IT COMES TO THE CATEGORIES

02:23:39.444 --> 02:23:41.412
OF LOW INCOME AND VERY LITTLE

02:23:41.479 --> 02:23:43.348
LOW INCOME OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING?

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:44.615
AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO

02:23:44.682 --> 02:23:46.317
CONTINUE TO INVEST TO ENSURE

02:23:46.384 --> 02:23:47.485
THAT WE HAVE HOUSING FOR THE

02:23:47.552 --> 02:23:49.320
NEXT GENERATION THE WORK FORCE

02:23:49.387 --> 02:23:50.955
IN FAMILIES AND SENIORS.

02:23:51.022 --> 02:23:52.991
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:23:53.057 --> 02:23:54.826
I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS BILL

02:23:54.892 --> 02:23:56.728
GOES A LONG WAY WITH THE

02:23:56.794 --> 02:23:58.629
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN

02:23:58.696 --> 02:24:00.898
RELATED TO BUS STOPS.

02:24:00.965 --> 02:24:02.400
IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

02:24:02.467 --> 02:24:03.668
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE BUS

02:24:03.735 --> 02:24:05.470
STOPS BECAUSE AS I'VE SAID

02:24:05.536 --> 02:24:08.606
BEFORE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

02:24:08.673 --> 02:24:09.941
THAT ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL.

02:24:10.008 --> 02:24:11.709
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:24:11.776 --> 02:24:13.211
THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN PLACE

02:24:13.277 --> 02:24:15.980

PEAK PERIODS IN TEN MINUTES.

02:24:19.684 --> 02:24:23.554
WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

02:24:23.621 --> 02:24:24.922
FROM WHERE WE WERE.

02:24:24.989 --> 02:24:26.290
COMING INTO THIS HEARING.

02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:27.725

02:24:27.792 --> 02:24:30.795
WERE ADVANCED BY COMMUNITIES UP

HOWEVER MORE FUNDS ARE ADDED TO

02:36:39.323 --> 02:36:40.591

02:36:40.657 --> 02:36:42.760
IF WE DO NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER

BUT TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM

02:36:59.943 --> 02:37:03.447
SUCCESSFUL WE NEED MORE

02:37:03.514 --> 02:37:04.648

02:37:09.853 --> 02:37:11.155
ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE.

02:37:11.221 --> 02:37:13.423

02:37:14.558 --> 02:37:16.093

THEY CAN UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA

02:37:20.564 --> 02:37:22.900
CAMPAIGNS MAILERS AND PROMOTE

02:37:22.966 --> 02:37:24.134
THEIR CAUSE AT MEETINGS.

02:37:24.201 --> 02:37:25.502
THE ENTIRE PROGRAM SHOULD BE

02:37:25.569 --> 02:37:27.204
MARKETED IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY

02:37:27.271 --> 02:37:29.373
AND BY INCREASING ELIGIBILITY I

02:37:29.439 --> 02:37:30.741
BELIEVE WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT

02:37:30.808 --> 02:37:31.842
SUCCESS.

MAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA

03:06:29.278 --> 03:06:30.946
TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION.

03:06:31.013 --> 03:06:34.182
AND WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THE

03:06:34.249 --> 03:06:35.617
WELL AS PROVIDING A POLICY A

03:06:35.684 --> 03:06:37.252
QUALITY EDUCATION WE HAVE

03:06:37.319 --> 03:06:38.854
SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE BILL.

03:06:38.921 --> 03:06:40.289
THE FIRST IS BY FACILITATING

03:06:40.355 --> 03:06:42.391
PARCEL TAX INCREASES THIS BILL

03:06:42.457 --> 03:06:43.792
WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR

03:06:43.859 --> 03:06:45.294
CALIFORNIANS TO AFFORD EITHER

03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:47.829
THE RENTAL OR HOME OWNERSHIP.

03:06:47.896 --> 03:06:49.264
THIS MORNING THE COMMITTEE SPENT

03:06:49.331 --> 03:06:50.632
OVER TWO HOURS TALKING ABOUT

03:06:50.699 --> 03:06:52.134
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE'RE

03:06:52.200 --> 03:06:53.235
VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS

03:06:53.302 --> 03:06:54.670
PARTICULAR BILL WOULD MAKE IT

03:06:54.736 --> 03:06:57.573
MORE DIFFICULT LESS AFFORDABLE

03:06:57.639 --> 03:06:58.840
FOR CALIFORNIANS.

03:06:58.907 --> 03:07:00.142
OUR SECOND ISSUE IS THAT.

03:07:00.208 --> 03:07:02.344
SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE A SPECIAL

03:07:02.411 --> 03:07:03.979
55% CARVE OUT UNDER THE

03:07:04.046 --> 03:07:05.714
CONSTITUTION ALL OTHER LOCAL

03:07:05.781 --> 03:07:07.549
GOVERNMENTS REQUIRED TWO THIRDS

03:07:07.616 --> 03:07:10.185
VOTE FOR TAX WILL TAX INCREASES.

03:07:10.252 --> 03:07:11.653
HOWEVER FOR SCHOOL BONTA

03:07:11.720 --> 03:07:13.288
CONSTITUTION ALREADY GRANTS A

03:07:13.355 --> 03:07:14.856
LOWER VOTE THRESHOLD FOR SCHOOL

03:07:14.923 --> 03:07:17.459
BONDS AT THIS TIME.

03:07:17.526 --> 03:07:20.362
THE EDUCATION FUNDING UNDER PROP

03:07:20.429 --> 03:07:20.996
NINETY EIGHT IS AT AN ALL TIME

03:07:21.063 --> 03:07:23.432
HIGH PROPERTY TAXES HAVE BEEN

03:07:23.498 --> 03:07:24.833
CONSISTENTLY GOING.

03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:26.802
AND HAVE THAT HAS PROVIDE A LOT

03:07:26.868 --> 03:07:28.804
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND BRACED

03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:30.472
REVENUES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:07:30.539 --> 03:07:31.573
FUNDING PRIMARILY WHICH GOOD

03:07:31.640 --> 03:07:33.742
EDUCATION SO WE QUESTION THE

03:07:33.809 --> 03:07:35.110
NEED FOR THE BILL AT THIS TIME.

03:07:35.177 --> 03:07:37.145
LAST AND NOT LEAST THE PUBLIC

03:07:37.212 --> 03:07:38.246
POLICY INSTITUTE OF ON YOUR

03:07:38.313 --> 03:07:40.882
RELEASED A POLL ON MARCH TO

03:07:40.949 --> 03:07:41.483
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THAT POLL

03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:45.220
INDICATED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY.

03:07:45.287 --> 03:07:46.955
A VOTERS SUPPORTED.

03:07:47.022 --> 03:07:48.357
THE TWO THIRDS AND MAINTAINING

03:07:48.423 --> 03:07:50.425
THE CURRENT VOTE THRESHOLD AND

03:07:50.492 --> 03:07:51.727
THAT WAS A CROSS DEMOGRAPHICS

03:07:51.793 --> 03:07:53.929
BOTH REPUBLICAN VOTERS AS WELL

03:07:53.996 --> 03:07:55.397
AS DEMOCRATIC VOTERS.

03:07:55.464 --> 03:07:56.498
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THAT

03:07:56.565 --> 03:07:58.433
ENCOMPASSES LARGE COUNTIES AND

03:07:58.500 --> 03:08:00.335
CITIES INCLUDING A LATE SUMMER

03:08:00.402 --> 03:08:02.604
CISCO Là AND LOS ANGELES SAN

03:08:02.671 --> 03:08:04.339
DIEGO RIVERSIDE EXEDRA AND THOSE

03:08:04.406 --> 03:08:05.540
IN SMALLER COUNTIES.

03:08:05.607 --> 03:08:06.608
SO WE QUESTION THE NEEDTO

03:08:06.675 --> 03:08:08.043
CHANGE

03:08:08.110 --> 03:08:09.778
THE VOTE THE SHOW AT THIS TIME

03:08:09.845 --> 03:08:10.879
AND ALSO THE MAJORITY OF DOLE'S

03:08:10.946 --> 03:08:14.116
I THINK IT'S OVER 60% CURRENTLY

03:08:14.182 --> 03:08:16.284
APPROVED BY VOTERS AT THE TWO

03:08:16.351 --> 03:08:16.952
THIRDS DASCHLE.

03:08:17.019 --> 03:08:19.655
SO IN OUR OPINION AND OUR HUMBLE

03:08:19.721 --> 03:08:20.555
OPINION THERE'S REALLY NO NEED

03:08:20.622 --> 03:08:22.290
TO CHANGE THE VOTE SPECIAL WHEN

03:08:22.357 --> 03:08:23.692
THERE HAD BEEN BILLS THAT HAVE

03:08:23.759 --> 03:08:25.060
NOT BEEN PASS OF THE TWO THIRDS.

03:08:25.127 --> 03:08:27.663
VOTE THRESHOLD THAT HAS RESULTED

03:08:27.729 --> 03:08:29.031
IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS GOING BACK.

03:08:29.097 --> 03:08:30.465
LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE AND

03:08:30.532 --> 03:08:32.968
REFORMATTING THAT PROPOSAL SO

03:08:33.035 --> 03:08:35.070
THAT IT IS BETTER HAS GREATER

03:08:35.137 --> 03:08:37.005
ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR VOTERS IN

03:08:37.072 --> 03:08:38.040
ORDER TO RECEIVE THE TWO THIRDS

03:08:38.106 --> 03:08:39.841
VOTE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE

03:08:39.908 --> 03:08:41.343
BILL HAS ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES.

03:08:41.410 --> 03:08:43.345
BUT BASED ON TRACK RECORD THAT

03:08:43.412 --> 03:08:45.313
WE HAVE AND FROM A DATABASE.

03:08:45.380 --> 03:08:46.815

03:08:46.882 --> 03:08:50.786

JUST WANT TO BEGIN BY PICKING UP

03:08:57.759 --> 03:08:58.960
ON THE THEME THAT MISSED HIM AND

03:08:59.027 --> 03:09:00.896
TALKED ABOUT ABOUT WEARING A TWO

03:09:00.962 --> 03:09:02.464
THIRDS VOTE BING UNNECESSARY.

03:09:02.531 --> 03:09:04.399
THERE'S MANY COUNTIES MEMBERS

BE REACHED AND WE KNOW IT CAN

03:09:13.041 --> 03:09:14.976

CALIFORNIA CITY FINANCE.

03:09:16.445 --> 03:09:17.412
A REVIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT

03:09:17.479 --> 03:09:19.681
PERSONAL TAXES SINCE TWENTY

03:09:19.748 --> 03:09:20.315
TWELVE SHOWED THAT IN NOVEMBER

03:09:20.382 --> 03:09:23.618
ELKS IN NOVEMBER ELECTION SINCE

03:09:23.685 --> 03:09:25.454
201275% OF THOSE MEASURES HAVE

03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:26.455
BEEN APPROVED.

03:09:26.521 --> 03:09:28.023
THE MAIN ISSUE MEMBERS THAT WE

03:09:28.090 --> 03:09:30.392
HAVE WITH PERSONAL TAXES IS THAT

03:09:30.459 --> 03:09:32.394
THEY ARE VERY REGRESSIVE IN THAT

03:09:32.461 --> 03:09:33.729
NO MATTER IF YOU OWN A ONE

03:09:33.795 --> 03:09:34.896
BEDROOM HOUSE OR A MILLION

03:09:34.963 --> 03:09:36.598
DOLLAR MANSION.

IN TEN THROUGH THIRDS VOTE IS

03:09:42.170 --> 03:09:43.605
FOR HOMEOWNERS IS INCREDIBLY

03:09:43.672 --> 03:09:45.273
IMPORTANT ALSO BECAUSE WELL

03:09:45.340 --> 03:09:46.875
EVERYBODY GETS TO VOTE ON THESE

03:09:46.942 --> 03:09:48.477
LOCAL PERSONAL TAXES ONLY

03:09:48.543 --> 03:09:50.045
PROPERTY OWNERS PAY THEM.

03:09:50.112 --> 03:09:51.113
YOU KNOW I LOVE BRING UP THIS

03:09:51.179 --> 03:09:52.481

03:09:56.752 --> 03:09:58.386
DEMOCRACY IS TWO WOLVES AND A

03:09:58.453 --> 03:10:03.625
SHEEP DECIDING WHAT'S FOR DINNER.

03:10:03.692 --> 03:10:04.493
AND I LOVE THAT QUOTE BECAUSE I

03:10:04.559 --> 03:10:05.727
THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE BILL YOU

03:10:05.794 --> 03:10:06.795
KNOW YOU DON'T WANNA CARRY THE

03:10:06.862 --> 03:10:07.829
METAPHOR ON TOO FAR BUT

03:10:07.896 --> 03:10:08.830
TAXPAYERS ARE THE SHEEP AND THE

03:10:08.897 --> 03:10:10.499
NEED TO BE PROTECTED IN THIS

03:10:10.565 --> 03:10:11.366
INSTANCE.

03:10:11.433 --> 03:10:12.968
AND HAVING A TWO THIRDS VOTE

03:10:13.034 --> 03:10:14.669
INSURERS THAT THAT'S THE CASE

03:10:14.736 --> 03:10:16.271
AND I'LL JUST CLOSE MISTER

03:10:16.338 --> 03:10:17.906
CHAIRMAN BY SAYING FINALLY THIS

03:10:17.973 --> 03:10:20.008
MEASURE DOES NOTHING EVEN AS MR

THOUSAND DOLLARS ADDING PERSONAL

03:10:29.851 --> 03:10:30.952

03:10:31.019 --> 03:10:32.320
IN THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER

YEAR THERE'S NOTHING TO AID THAT

03:10:34.156 --> 03:10:35.590

THIS LEGISLATION -- SENATOR BELL

03:23:23.591 --> 03:23:24.992
WHEN YOU AND I WERE IN THE

03:23:25.059 --> 03:23:26.961
ASSEMBLY TOGETHER WE WENT

03:23:27.028 --> 03:23:29.630
THROUGH THE HOUSING CRISIS AND

03:23:29.697 --> 03:23:31.165
THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN

03:23:31.232 --> 03:23:36.871
CALIFORNIA. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

03:23:36.938 --> 03:23:38.272
EIGHT THEY HIT A RECORD LOW A

03:23:38.339 --> 03:23:39.874
COUPLE OF YEARS LATER WHERE

03:23:39.941 --> 03:23:41.509
THOSE HOMES WERE WORTH.

03:23:41.576 --> 03:23:42.810
HALF OF WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY

03:23:42.877 --> 03:23:44.845
WERE WORTH IN SOME AREAS OF THE

03:23:44.912 --> 03:23:47.381
STATE HOME PRICES HAVE RECOVERED

03:23:47.448 --> 03:23:49.050
BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE

03:23:49.116 --> 03:23:50.785
HOME PRICES ARE STILL.

03:23:50.851 --> 03:23:52.753
ARTIFICIALLY LOW AND MANY

03:23:52.820 --> 03:23:54.722
HOMEOWNERS WHO PURCHASED HOMES

03:23:54.789 --> 03:23:57.391
DURING THAT TIME WHEN PRICES

03:23:57.458 --> 03:23:59.126
WERE AT RECORD HIGHS.

03:23:59.193 --> 03:24:01.195
THEY STILL HAVE LESS THAN 20%

03:24:01.262 --> 03:24:03.097
EQUITY IN THEIR HOME SO IF YOU

03:24:03.164 --> 03:24:06.767
HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WAS FIFTY FIVE

03:24:06.834 --> 03:24:08.069
SIXTY FIVE I TEN FIFTEEN YEARS

03:24:08.135 --> 03:24:08.836
AGO.

03:24:08.903 --> 03:24:10.871
AND THERE THE VALUE OF THEIR

03:24:10.938 --> 03:24:12.673
HOME CRASHED AND THEY'RE NEEDING

03:24:12.740 --> 03:24:14.108
THIS ASSISTANCE.

03:24:14.175 --> 03:24:15.576
IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THEY

03:24:15.643 --> 03:24:19.080
WOULDN'T HAVE -- EVEN 20% EQUITY

03:24:19.146 --> 03:24:20.081
IN THEIR HOME.

03:24:20.147 --> 03:24:22.049
BEFORE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS WE

03:24:22.116 --> 03:24:24.685
DID OFFER THIS PROGRAM AS LONG

03:24:24.752 --> 03:24:27.288
AS INDIVIDUALS HAD AT LEAST 20%

03:24:27.355 --> 03:24:30.191
EQUITY IN THEIR HOME AND NOW.

03:24:30.257 --> 03:24:31.525
THAN THAT PROGRAM WENT AWAY

03:24:31.592 --> 03:24:33.661
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS

03:24:33.728 --> 03:24:36.230
AND THEN WHEN IT WAS RESTORED.

03:24:36.297 --> 03:24:38.532
THE LEGISLATURE CAUTIOUSLY

03:24:38.599 --> 03:24:40.968
REIMPLEMENTED THE PROGRAM WITH A

03:24:41.035 --> 03:24:43.571
40% REQUIREMENT FOR EQUITY WHICH

03:24:43.638 --> 03:24:46.741
MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO AGAIN BOUGHT.

03:24:46.807 --> 03:24:49.377
WHEN HOMES WERE RECORD HIGHS?

03:24:49.443 --> 03:24:50.678
IT WOULD BE YEARS BEFORE THEY

03:24:50.745 --> 03:24:52.380
COULD REACH THAT 40% EQUITY

03:24:52.446 --> 03:24:54.281
LEVEL SO WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IN

03:24:54.348 --> 03:24:55.850
THIS BILL IS FOR US TO SIMPLY

03:24:55.916 --> 03:24:57.218

DOWNTURN BUT WE ACTUALLY MAKE.

03:25:04.425 --> 03:25:04.925
WHERE HOMEOWNERS CAN INDEED

03:25:04.992 --> 03:25:07.328
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM IF

03:25:07.395 --> 03:25:08.963
THE NEED ARISES FOR THEM TO DO

03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:10.731

ABOUT THESE ISSUES GOING ALL THE

03:39:58.418 --> 03:40:00.120
WAY BACK TO TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE

03:40:00.186 --> 03:40:00.720
WAS A SENSE THAT THINGS WERE

03:40:00.787 --> 03:40:02.088
CHANGING AND TRYING TO FIGURE

03:40:02.155 --> 03:40:03.390

AS YOU ALL KNOWS A SALES TAX

GET AHEAD OF THE ISSUE.

03:40:18.672 --> 03:40:21.274
SO -- ANYWAY THIS BILL -- IN ITS

03:40:21.341 --> 03:40:22.842
CURRENT FORM -- AS SENATOR SAYS

03:40:43.330 --> 03:40:44.931
THE TRICKY PART ABOUT THE IS

03:40:44.998 --> 03:40:46.600
WHEN THERE IS AN AGREEMENT THAT

03:40:46.666 --> 03:40:47.867

FOCUS ON THE CHANGE.

03:52:01.974 --> 03:52:04.043
FROM LAST YEAR SO I'M GOING TO

03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:06.145
PARAPHRASE.

03:52:06.212 --> 03:52:06.779
YOU ARE KEEPING COMMUNITIES THAT

03:52:06.846 --> 03:52:07.747
HAVE.

03:52:07.813 --> 03:52:09.282
RECENTLY AGREED UPON CONTRACTS

03:52:09.348 --> 03:52:10.783
IN PLACE.

03:52:10.850 --> 03:52:12.118
THAT'S CORRECT IN THAT DOES NOT

03:52:12.184 --> 03:52:14.320
PRECLUDE THAT LAST YEAR.

03:52:14.387 --> 03:52:15.955
THE PROPOSAL WAS TO ELIMINATE

03:52:16.022 --> 03:52:17.256
ALL THESE AGREEMENTS.

03:52:17.323 --> 03:52:19.058
I AND AND THIS IS THAT A MEMBER

03:52:19.125 --> 03:52:20.426
I TOOK IN THE ASSEMBLY WAS

03:52:20.493 --> 03:52:22.528
FACING THOSE CONTRACTS AS

03:52:22.595 --> 03:52:24.463
EXISTING CONTRACTS OUT OVER TEN

03:52:24.530 --> 03:52:25.598
YEARS.

03:52:25.665 --> 03:52:26.599
SO WOULD HAVE PLACED ON THE

03:52:26.666 --> 03:52:28.100
BALLOT PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE

03:52:28.167 --> 03:52:29.602
VOTERS HAVE TO DECIDE THAT TYPE

03:52:29.669 --> 03:52:30.403
OF A CHANGE.

03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:32.071
AND THEN THE TEN YEAR PHASE AND

03:52:32.138 --> 03:52:33.906
THAT'S HOW THE AS IT WAS SITTING

03:52:33.973 --> 03:52:35.741
ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE THAT'S

03:52:35.808 --> 03:52:37.710
WHERE IT ENDED UP.

03:52:37.777 --> 03:52:39.512
AND SO DOES HIS ME WAS IT MAYBE

03:52:39.578 --> 03:52:40.913
WE DID THAT HERE.

03:52:40.980 --> 03:52:42.181
I'M NT SURE BUT I THINK THAT IT

03:52:42.248 --> 03:52:43.616
DOESN'T PRECLUDE SOMEONE ANOTHER

03:52:43.683 --> 03:52:44.950
IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE AN ENTITY

03:52:45.017 --> 03:52:47.053
FROM MAKING TO EXTENDING THEIR

03:52:47.119 --> 03:52:47.953
CONTRACT NOW.

03:52:48.020 --> 03:52:49.622
AS WELL I DON'T BELIEVE THE

03:52:49.689 --> 03:52:51.490
LEGISLATION THREE DOZEN TO

03:52:51.557 --> 03:52:53.092
AFFECT THAT YEAH THAT SIR THE

03:52:53.159 --> 03:52:53.726
ONLY REASON I BRING THAT UP IS

03:52:53.793 --> 03:52:54.593
THAT.

03:52:54.660 --> 03:52:57.229
AGAIN WANTING TO BE A STRIKE A

03:52:57.296 --> 03:52:58.798
COMPROMISE RIGHT OF LIGHT.

03:52:58.864 --> 03:53:00.466
IF SOMEONE IS NEGOTIATED

03:53:00.533 --> 03:53:02.234
CONTRACTS ON MAKING THIS UP IT'S

03:53:02.301 --> 03:53:05.638
GIVEN 50% TO MACY'S OR 60% OLD.

03:53:05.705 --> 03:53:07.373
RIGHT OUR OF WHATEVER THAT

03:53:07.440 --> 03:53:09.041
REVENUES BACK AND THEY'RE ABLE

03:53:09.108 --> 03:53:11.811
TO KEEP THE OTHER FORTY OR 50%.

03:53:11.877 --> 03:53:12.912
THIS BILL WILL NOT INTERRUPTING

03:53:12.978 --> 03:53:13.979
THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT WITH IT

03:53:14.046 --> 03:53:15.581
WOULD NOT AND THAT'S WHY THE

03:53:15.648 --> 03:53:16.549
LANGUAGE THAT WE HEARD FROM

03:53:16.615 --> 03:53:17.683
WITNESSES THAT SAID WE WERE

03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:19.385
GOING TO DEVASTATE OVER GOING TO

03:53:19.452 --> 03:53:20.119
HARM.

03:53:20.186 --> 03:53:21.087
IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO KIND OF

03:53:21.153 --> 03:53:22.188
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COULD SAY

03:53:22.254 --> 03:53:23.289
WE'RE GONNA DEVASTATE WE'RE

03:53:23.356 --> 03:53:24.523
GONNA HARM AND WE'RE NOT.

03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:25.891
AFFECTING ANY OF THEIR EXISTING

03:53:25.958 --> 03:53:27.660
AGREEMENTS YEAH I THINK THAT'S

03:53:27.727 --> 03:53:28.961
IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS.

03:53:29.028 --> 03:53:34.700
REVISED LEGISLATION IS.

03:53:34.767 --> 03:53:35.334
I'LL CALL THAT HOLD HARMLESS AT

03:53:35.401 --> 03:53:35.968
IF YOU HAVE A CONTRACT IN PLACE

03:53:36.035 --> 03:53:36.802
IT STAYS IN PLACE AND DOES NOT

03:53:36.869 --> 03:53:37.670
PRECLUDE FOR EXAMPLE THIS YEAR.

03:53:37.737 --> 03:53:38.904
IF THE MINISTER I WANT TO BE

03:53:38.971 --> 03:53:40.806
ABLE TO EXTEND IT ALWAYS EXTEND

03:53:40.873 --> 03:53:42.308
NOW AS WELL I MEAN THAT'S WITHIN

03:53:42.375 --> 03:53:43.476
THE BILL THAT THAT'S CORRECT AND

03:53:43.542 --> 03:53:45.077
I I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT ALL

03:53:45.144 --> 03:53:46.579
THOSE AGREEMENTS THAT TAKE INTO

03:53:46.645 --> 03:53:47.913
ACCOUNT A POTENTIAL CHANGE IN

03:53:47.980 --> 03:53:48.314
LAW.

03:53:48.381 --> 03:53:49.582
SO THAT IF WE WERE TO CHANGE THE

03:53:49.648 --> 03:53:50.950
LAW THOSE CONTRACTS COULD BE

03:53:51.016 --> 03:53:53.085
VOID I I I BELIEVE THAT MANY THE

03:53:53.152 --> 03:53:54.453
MERIT THAT WAY SO THAT.

03:53:54.520 --> 03:53:55.755
THE CITY'S WOULD NOT BE HARMED

03:53:55.821 --> 03:53:57.456
BY THAT THAT MORNING OF THE

03:53:57.523 --> 03:53:58.557
CONTRACT BUT THAT WAS UNDER THE

03:53:58.624 --> 03:54:00.259
OLD BILL LAST YEAR.

03:54:00.326 --> 03:54:03.095
THIS YEAR IT'S NOT AS YOU'VE

03:54:03.162 --> 03:54:04.930
EXPLAINED.

03:54:04.997 --> 03:54:05.231
ALL RIGHT.

I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY

03:54:06.031 --> 03:54:06.699

FURTHER THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS

04:02:08.680 --> 04:02:11.750
SET BY THE STATE AS I MENTIONED --

04:02:11.817 --> 04:02:13.585
YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW THAT.

04:02:13.652 --> 04:02:14.586
DID WITH CIGARETTES FOR EXAMPLE

04:02:14.653 --> 04:02:15.520
THEY'VE THEIR TAX IN NEARLY

04:02:15.587 --> 04:02:16.421
THREE DOLLARS THAT'S REDUCE

04:02:16.488 --> 04:02:18.123
SMOKING RATES SIGNIFICANTLY BUT

04:02:18.190 --> 04:02:19.758
THOSE PEOPLE WHO BUT IMPORTANT

04:02:19.825 --> 04:02:20.459
HERE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

04:02:20.525 --> 04:02:21.627
REVENUE NEUTRAL.

04:02:21.693 --> 04:02:22.828
ITEM THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

PURCHASING.

04:02:24.396 --> 04:02:28.934
LOW INTENSITY -- ITEMS OUT OF BE

04:02:29.001 --> 04:02:30.135
ABLE TO PAY LESS.

04:02:30.202 --> 04:02:30.736
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

04:02:30.802 --> 04:02:33.338
TRYING TO DO HERE SO.

04:02:33.405 --> 04:02:35.040
NOW THEY SAY IT'S A STUDY BILL.

04:02:35.107 --> 04:02:37.376
AND I SERIOUSLY MEAN IT WHEN I

04:02:37.442 --> 04:02:39.578

LOOK LOVE THE IDEA.

04:02:42.414 --> 04:02:43.982
BUT IT'S JUST TOO ON FEASIBLE

04:02:44.049 --> 04:02:45.884
HERE HERE THE REASONS WHY -- YOU

04:02:45.951 --> 04:02:47.319
KNOW EVEN THOUGH IT'S A GREAT

04:02:47.386 --> 04:02:49.454
IDEA CONCEPTUALLY IT'S JUST TOO

04:02:49.521 --> 04:02:50.589
COMPLICATED OR TOO DIFFICULT TO

04:02:50.656 --> 04:02:51.423
IMPLEMENT.

04:02:51.490 --> 04:02:52.891
LET'S NOT PURSUE IT AT THE LAST

04:02:52.958 --> 04:02:55.894
THING I WANT IS A A BEAR OF A

04:02:55.961 --> 04:02:57.029

WE WANT THEM TO COME BACK WITH

04:03:05.504 --> 04:03:06.505
US.

04:03:06.571 --> 04:03:07.139
IT WAS SOME IDEAS AND THOUGHTS

04:03:07.205 --> 04:03:08.206
AND AS THEY SAY IF THEY COME

04:03:08.273 --> 04:03:09.574
BACK AND SAY IT'S ON FEASIBLE

04:03:09.641 --> 04:03:10.776
WE'RE NOT GOING TO PURSUE IT --

04:03:10.842 --> 04:03:13.245
AND SO WITH ME TODAY I HAVE

THAT TAKE PLACE.

04:11:56.334 --> 04:11:58.937
I KNOW WE HAVE TO RESERVE YOUR

04:11:59.003 --> 04:12:00.772
YACHT -- SO.

04:12:00.839 --> 04:12:02.607
THE SALES TAXES REALTORS

04:12:02.674 --> 04:12:04.576
REPRESSIVE COMPARED TO OTHER.

04:12:04.642 --> 04:12:06.611
SO [inaudible]

04:12:06.678 --> 04:12:08.980
RAISES -- YEAH.

04:12:09.047 --> 04:12:11.115
YEAH IS A VERY IS OUT YOU KNOW

WHEN YOU LOOK AT TAXES YOU HAVE

04:12:12.851 --> 04:12:13.518
TO REVIEW.

04:12:13.585 --> 04:12:16.721
YES SAID OF THINGS TO LOOK OUT.

04:12:16.788 --> 04:12:18.957
AND INCLUDING THAT REGRESSIVITY

04:12:19.023 --> 04:12:20.191
AND YOU KNOW THE IMPACT ON YEAH

04:12:20.258 --> 04:12:22.694
MAYBE THE IMPACT ON CERTAIN

04:12:22.760 --> 04:12:23.962
AREAS OF THE ECONOMY.

04:12:24.028 --> 04:12:25.763
GREAT QUESTION CENTER WE

04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:27.165
ABSOLUTELY THOSE WOULD BE THINGS

04:12:27.232 --> 04:12:28.733
HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT I YOU KNOW I

04:12:28.800 --> 04:12:30.301
I KNOW THAT OF COURSE REMEMBER

04:12:30.368 --> 04:12:32.504
WE'RE GETTING RID OF THE CELLS

04:12:32.570 --> 04:12:33.137
WE WILL BE RIGHT IN THE CITY THE

04:12:33.204 --> 04:12:34.005
STATE PORTIONS.

04:12:34.072 --> 04:12:36.808
AND AND ON PAGE THREE OF THE

04:12:36.875 --> 04:12:38.243
BILL RIGHT ITEM SEVENTY TALKS

04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:40.345
ABOUT AND THE FACT THAT THEY

04:12:40.411 --> 04:12:43.615
THEY WILL NEED.

04:12:43.681 --> 04:12:45.350
TO EXPLORE.

04:12:45.416 --> 04:12:46.050
AND IDENTIFY THE IMPACTS OF

04:12:46.117 --> 04:12:46.651
REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON TAX ON

04:12:46.718 --> 04:12:47.619
VARIOUS INCOME LEVELS AND WAYS

04:12:47.685 --> 04:12:48.119
TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT

04:12:48.186 --> 04:12:49.153
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT.

04:12:49.220 --> 04:12:51.322
LOW INCOME CONSUMERS THAT'S AYE

04:12:51.389 --> 04:12:52.891
LINES.

04:12:52.957 --> 04:12:53.558
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY SO THAT'S AN

04:12:53.625 --> 04:12:54.659
IMPORTANT AND REQUIRED PORTION

04:12:54.726 --> 04:12:57.395
OF THIS.

04:12:57.462 --> 04:13:02.700
AND THEN THE SALES TAX HAS AREAS --

04:13:02.767 --> 04:13:05.370
EXEMPTIONS OTHER KINDS OF PAYING

04:13:05.436 --> 04:13:06.838
TO NO LOOPHOLES.

04:13:06.905 --> 04:13:08.773
IT'S KIND OF A SWISS CHEESE TAX

04:13:08.840 --> 04:13:11.676
LIKE A LOT OF OUR TAX OR THE

04:13:11.743 --> 04:13:13.545
HOLES IN IT NO.

04:13:13.611 --> 04:13:18.249
ARE YOU LOOKING AT A LOT.

04:13:18.316 --> 04:13:20.618
KIND OF TAX FOR DEPARTMENT OR

04:13:20.685 --> 04:13:24.556
SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED WERE

04:13:24.622 --> 04:13:24.856
[inaudible]

04:13:24.923 --> 04:13:25.990
ECONOMIC.

04:13:26.057 --> 04:13:27.559
ECONOMIC ISSUES I THINK THE IDEA

04:13:27.625 --> 04:13:29.827
WAS WOULD LIKELY BE THAT IT

04:13:29.894 --> 04:13:31.963
WOULD BE YEAH THE IF IF IT WERE

04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:34.399
EVER TO BE IMPLEMENTED IT WOULD

04:13:34.465 --> 04:13:36.568
IT WOULD BE DONE.

04:13:36.634 --> 04:13:38.736
LACE AND WE DETERMINE BY

04:13:38.803 --> 04:13:40.538
INTENSITY BY BY CARBON INTENSITY

04:13:40.605 --> 04:13:41.539
TO THEIR BE.

04:13:41.606 --> 04:13:44.642
I VARYING LEVELS.

04:13:44.709 --> 04:13:47.312
YOU KNOW ASSOCIATED WITH WITH

04:13:47.378 --> 04:13:47.946
COMPETENCY BUT NO ALL THAT BEING

04:13:48.012 --> 04:13:48.646
SAID [inaudible]

04:13:48.713 --> 04:13:50.281
TAX AND IN VIEW MINISTRATION

04:13:50.348 --> 04:13:51.215
WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF

04:13:51.282 --> 04:13:51.849
TIME LOOKING AT ALL THE

04:13:51.916 --> 04:13:52.784
IMPLICATIONS IN ISSUES INCLUDING

04:13:52.850 --> 04:13:53.484
SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS.

04:13:53.551 --> 04:13:55.853
IMPACTS AND COME UP WITH A

04:13:55.920 --> 04:13:57.655
FORMULA THAT WE DID THE BOTH IS

04:13:57.722 --> 04:13:59.824
REFLECTIVE OF THE GOALS OF THE

04:13:59.891 --> 04:14:01.759
THE BILL.

04:14:01.826 --> 04:14:03.361
WHILE ALSO REFLECTING A NUMBER

04:14:03.428 --> 04:14:05.530
OF THE OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING

04:14:05.597 --> 04:14:08.299
FAIRNESS AND EQUITY AND MAKE

04:14:08.366 --> 04:14:08.933
SURE THIS IS A DISPROPORTIONATE

04:14:09.000 --> 04:14:10.368
BURDEN MORE.

04:14:10.435 --> 04:14:12.437
AND THE LAST ONE MISTER CHAIRMAN

04:14:12.503 --> 04:14:14.372
I THINK IN TERMS WHAT I'M.

04:14:14.439 --> 04:14:15.239
MASSIVE SOME QUESTIONS ARE

04:14:15.306 --> 04:14:19.077
PROBABLY WOULD APPLY TO ANY KIND

04:14:19.143 --> 04:14:23.114
OF STUDY OF ANY -- ANOTHER GREAT

04:14:23.181 --> 04:14:24.315
DAY AT THE STATE.

04:14:24.382 --> 04:14:26.718
WHEN YOU DO A -- WHEN YOU LOOK

04:14:26.784 --> 04:14:27.819
AT A TAX I THINK?

04:14:27.885 --> 04:14:28.886
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT HOW

04:14:28.953 --> 04:14:30.555
MUCH IT COSTS TO MINISTER.

04:14:30.622 --> 04:14:34.626
COMPARED SO IF YOU WANTED.

04:14:34.692 --> 04:14:35.593
TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE

04:14:35.660 --> 04:14:37.829
GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT.

04:14:37.895 --> 04:14:38.997
AND THEN YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT

04:14:39.063 --> 04:14:41.366
FROM THE BUSINESS STANDPOINT.

04:14:41.432 --> 04:14:45.436
COM YEAH LIKE THE SALES TAX.

04:14:45.503 --> 04:14:46.070
THE FACT BUSINESS AND THEY HAVE

04:14:46.137 --> 04:14:47.171
TO DO.

04:14:47.238 --> 04:14:49.474
THAT KIND OF COLLECTION IN THE

04:14:49.540 --> 04:14:51.309
COLLECTION PROCESS AND

04:14:51.376 --> 04:14:53.044
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TAX.

04:14:53.111 --> 04:14:57.415
I THINK I THINK THE THERE'S AN

04:14:57.482 --> 04:14:59.150
ADVANTAGE TO TAXES THAT DON'T

04:14:59.217 --> 04:15:01.252
HAVE HIGH ADMINISTRATIVE OVER

04:15:01.319 --> 04:15:04.489
CAPSULES.

04:15:04.555 --> 04:15:05.123
ON THE OTHER HAND WE WANT TO BE

04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.990
FAIR.

04:15:06.057 --> 04:15:07.025
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

04:15:07.091 --> 04:15:09.627
UNDERSTAND.

04:15:09.694 --> 04:15:12.163
THE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF

04:15:12.230 --> 04:15:13.831
THE TAXES THAT ARE THIS.

04:15:13.898 --> 04:15:15.233
YES.

04:15:15.299 --> 04:15:18.002
SO BOTH TURNED. TO BOOK BOTH THE

04:15:18.069 --> 04:15:19.103
SECTION JUST AFTER THE ONE THAT

04:15:19.170 --> 04:15:20.638
I READY ABOUT LOW INCOME

04:15:20.705 --> 04:15:22.607
CONSUMERS SECTION EIGHT TALKS

04:15:22.674 --> 04:15:25.710
ABOUT -- YOU KNOW.

04:15:25.777 --> 04:15:27.645
THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IN THE

04:15:27.712 --> 04:15:28.713
PRIVATE SECTOR TO COMPLY WITH

04:15:28.780 --> 04:15:30.448
THE NEW TAX SYSTEM IDENTIFY THE

04:15:30.515 --> 04:15:31.215
NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS FOR

04:15:31.282 --> 04:15:32.216
COMPLIANCE.

04:15:32.283 --> 04:15:33.151
THE OTHER THING I'LL MENTION IS

04:15:33.217 --> 04:15:34.118
IT PAGE FOR THE HOUSE OF

04:15:34.185 --> 04:15:36.054
GOVERNMENT TO RIGHT TO THE

04:15:36.120 --> 04:15:36.788
GOVERNMENT.

04:15:36.854 --> 04:15:37.955
TO I'M SO THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

04:15:38.022 --> 04:15:39.457
A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO ADD INTO

04:15:39.524 --> 04:15:41.559
THE BILL I WOULD I THINK THAT

04:15:41.626 --> 04:15:42.193
WOULD BE A GOOD ADDITION TO THAT

04:15:42.260 --> 04:15:43.528
I DON'T ANYMORE.

04:15:43.594 --> 04:15:45.296
I WILL SAY I THERE'S THE THE

04:15:45.363 --> 04:15:46.564
BOTTOM PAGE FOUR OF YOUR

04:15:46.631 --> 04:15:49.067
COMMITTEES ANALYSIS DOES TALK A

04:15:49.133 --> 04:15:50.535
LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

04:15:50.601 --> 04:15:52.170
THIS ISSUE IT SAYS CARBON TAXES

04:15:52.236 --> 04:15:53.004
REGIONAL CONSIDERED A MINISTRY

04:15:53.071 --> 04:15:54.238
USABLE AND REASONABLY SIMPLE.

04:15:54.305 --> 04:15:55.673
FOR AGENCIES TO ENFORCE

04:15:55.740 --> 04:15:58.109
COMPLIANCE BECAUSE SOMEBODY LIKE

04:15:58.176 --> 04:16:00.344
90% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

04:16:00.411 --> 04:16:02.046
ARE CURRENTLY REPORTED. TO THE

04:16:02.113 --> 04:16:04.782
USEPA SO THERE'S THERE'S ALREADY

04:16:04.849 --> 04:16:05.383
A WELL DEVELOPED STRUCTURE FOR

04:16:05.450 --> 04:16:06.718
COLLECTING.

04:16:06.784 --> 04:16:10.121
A DATE ON THIS AND AND IT TALKS

04:16:10.188 --> 04:16:12.056

ACTING TO BUT THERE THERE'S NO

04:46:34.243 --> 04:46:35.545
QUESTION THAT THIS IS A DELICATE

04:46:35.611 --> 04:46:36.546
BALANCE.

IS REALLY DOES BECOME A A GOOD

04:46:54.997 --> 04:46:56.432
VALUE PROPOSITION THE STATE.

04:46:56.499 --> 04:46:57.700
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS NOT

04:46:57.767 --> 04:46:58.200
ABOUT JUST GOING OFF AND

04:46:58.267 --> 04:46:59.669

THAT IS APPOINTED BASED ON THEIR

05:06:07.515 --> 05:06:09.417
PARTY PREFERENCE -- AND SO

05:06:09.484 --> 05:06:11.553
THAT'S NOT AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING

I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

05:06:14.856 --> 05:06:15.657
WORTH.

05:06:15.724 --> 05:06:17.192
CONSIDERING AND THE THE BILL

05:06:17.258 --> 05:06:18.626
ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE

05:06:18.693 --> 05:06:21.329
COMMISSION MEMBERS TO BE ARE

05:06:21.396 --> 05:06:22.864
FORTUNATE TO THE AS THAT.

05:06:22.931 --> 05:06:27.569
AS MS WEBER POINTED OUT TO THE

PARTY REGISTRATION OF THE COUNTY --

05:06:29.070 --> 05:06:31.439
BUT IT ALSO DISALLOWS THE A

05:06:31.506 --> 05:06:33.341
MAJORITY OF THE COMMISSION TO BE

05:06:33.408 --> 05:06:34.909
MADE UP OF ANYONE PARTY AND

05:06:34.976 --> 05:06:36.444
THERE ARE SEVERAL COUNTIES WHERE

05:06:36.511 --> 05:06:37.946
YOU CAN'T DO BOTH OF THOSE

05:06:38.012 --> 05:06:40.014
THINGS AND SO IN THOSE CASES

05:06:40.081 --> 05:06:41.950
WHAT WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT

05:06:42.016 --> 05:06:43.151
EXTRA MEMBER.

05:06:43.218 --> 05:06:45.019
WHO WHO DO WE GIVE IT -- TO IF

A MAJORITY TO A SINGLE PART.

05:06:52.694 --> 05:06:54.295
SO I I JUST THAT SOMETHING WORTH

05:06:54.362 --> 05:06:55.830
CONSIDERING GETTING NOT NOT OF A

05:06:55.897 --> 05:06:57.398
REASON TO BE OPPOSED TO

SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONCERNED

05:06:58.233 --> 05:06:59.801
ABOUT.

05:06:59.868 --> 05:07:01.202
I WE WOULD ALSO BRING UP THE

05:07:01.269 --> 05:07:02.837
POINT THAT WAS RAISED ABOUT THE

05:07:02.904 --> 05:07:04.906

COMMISSION MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED --

05:07:20.455 --> 05:07:22.290
AND IT WAS UNCLEAR TO US IN THE

05:07:22.357 --> 05:07:23.725

IF WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT PLEDGE

05:07:40.775 --> 05:07:42.811

BUT NO INDIVIDUAL PARTY.

05:09:28.349 --> 05:09:30.952
COULD HAVE A MAJORITY.

05:09:31.019 --> 05:09:31.486

WHERE THERE'S A STRONG

05:09:33.621 --> 05:09:35.290
DEMOCRATIC?

05:09:36.557 --> 05:09:38.493
HI THERE COULD NOT BE A

05:09:38.559 --> 05:09:40.128
DEMOCRATIC.

05:09:40.194 --> 05:09:43.798

05:16:07.815 --> 05:16:08.983
IT THIS WAY.

05:16:09.050 --> 05:16:10.451
IT'S NOT PERMISSIVE.

05:16:10.518 --> 05:16:12.253
SO IT'S IT'S AGAIN PART OF THIS

05:16:12.320 --> 05:16:14.322
TEAM THAT KIND OF COPS UP THIS

05:16:14.388 --> 05:16:15.089
CROPS OF THIS YEAR.

05:16:15.156 --> 05:16:16.957
ALLEN THIS IS LOCAL CONTROL WERE

05:16:17.024 --> 05:16:18.292
TELLING SO MANY.

05:16:18.359 --> 05:16:19.994
MUNICIPALITIES THIS YEAR WE'RE

05:16:20.061 --> 05:16:23.464
GONNA FORCE LAND PLANNING OR YOU

05:16:23.531 --> 05:16:24.332
KNOW HOUSING ARE ALL KIND OF

05:16:24.398 --> 05:16:25.833
HEALTH NEEDS OF IDEAS ON THE

05:16:25.900 --> 05:16:26.867
LOCALS ARE.

05:16:26.934 --> 05:16:28.202
SO I JUST BRING THAT UP.

05:16:28.269 --> 05:16:29.603
ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS IS A

05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:30.738
PHILOSOPHY OF NO BETTER NO WORSE

05:16:30.805 --> 05:16:31.672
AND THEY WERE SAYING THIS IS

05:16:31.739 --> 05:16:35.042
APPLICABLE TO ONLY COUNTIES WITH.

05:16:35.109 --> 05:16:35.643
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OR

05:16:35.710 --> 05:16:37.578
MORE SO IT DOESN'T GO TO ALL

05:16:37.645 --> 05:16:38.813
COUNTY SAMPLE NERVOUS ABOUT A

05:16:38.879 --> 05:16:43.384
TWO TIERED.

05:16:43.451 --> 05:16:45.786
SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- I

05:16:45.853 --> 05:16:47.088
WILL SUGGEST SURE THIS THAT

05:16:47.154 --> 05:16:47.755
THEIR POINT THAT WAS MADE TO THE

05:16:47.822 --> 05:16:49.824
SUPERVISORS ARE NONPARTISAN.

05:16:49.890 --> 05:16:52.193

NON PARTISAN OFFICE I'M NOW IN

05:16:53.694 --> 05:16:54.528
PARTISAN OFFICE AND IT IS.

05:16:54.595 --> 05:16:55.596
I'D SAY IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

05:16:55.663 --> 05:16:57.765
BEING OF A REPUBLICAN SENATOR

05:16:57.832 --> 05:16:58.966

DIFFERENT ANIMAL SO WE ARE DOING

05:17:09.276 --> 05:17:10.344

TO NONPARTISAN INDIVIDUALS

05:17:13.647 --> 05:17:14.982
THAT'S THAT'S IT'S A NEW TWIST.

05:17:15.049 --> 05:17:16.884
AND THEN I WILL ALSO SAVE OR ON

05:17:16.951 --> 05:17:18.753

05:29:08.895 --> 05:29:10.030
OF MOVE LA.

YOU HAD BEFORE YOU A LETTER OF

05:29:11.865 --> 05:29:12.966

ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS I

05:29:14.367 --> 05:29:15.402
LIKE TO ADD.

05:29:15.469 --> 05:29:16.670
PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAD TO

05:29:16.736 --> 05:29:19.072
THAT AS WELL -- BUT I PREFER TO

05:29:19.139 --> 05:29:20.974
SPEAK TODAY AS THE FATHER OF A

05:29:21.041 --> 05:29:21.675
TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD WHO'S

05:29:21.741 --> 05:29:25.011
QUITE WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE.

05:29:25.078 --> 05:29:26.146
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE

05:29:26.213 --> 05:29:28.381
THREE REASONS REALLY WHY THIS --

05:29:28.448 --> 05:29:29.816
SHOULD BE APPROVED BY THE

05:29:29.883 --> 05:29:31.084
COMMITTEE THE FIRST.

05:29:31.151 --> 05:29:34.020
AS MR NASH TREE HAS STATED IS

05:29:34.087 --> 05:29:36.022
REALLY DIESEL AIR POLLUTION IN

05:29:36.089 --> 05:29:37.491
THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY

05:29:37.557 --> 05:29:39.025
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WHICH IS A

05:29:39.092 --> 05:29:40.460
NON TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT THE

05:29:40.527 --> 05:29:42.462
DOMINANT SOURCE.

05:29:42.529 --> 05:29:44.064
OF AIR POLLUTION IN THE DISTRICT

05:29:44.131 --> 05:29:45.899
WHICH RESIST REGULATION BECAUSE

05:29:45.966 --> 05:29:46.766
ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN

05:29:46.833 --> 05:29:48.502
REGULATE IT WE NEED IN THE

05:29:48.568 --> 05:29:50.203
CENTER PROGRAM ON SCALE THEY'VE

05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:52.072
ESTIMATED BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

05:29:52.139 --> 05:29:53.140
FOR THAT PROGRAM.

05:29:53.206 --> 05:29:55.809
THE SECOND PURPOSE REALLY IS TO

05:29:55.876 --> 05:29:57.978
JOIN YOU IN THE FIGHT AGAINST

05:29:58.044 --> 05:29:59.813
CLIMATE CHANGE. TO REDUCE

05:29:59.880 --> 05:30:02.115
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE KNOW

05:30:02.182 --> 05:30:04.718
NOW THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO ROLL

05:30:04.784 --> 05:30:06.119
BACK GLOBAL WARMING.

05:30:06.186 --> 05:30:07.521
HOWEVER IT WILL TAKE A

05:30:07.587 --> 05:30:09.022
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THERE'S

05:30:09.089 --> 05:30:10.090
ONLY TWO PLACES WITHOUT

05:30:10.157 --> 05:30:11.858
INVESTMENT CAN REALLY COME FROM

05:30:11.925 --> 05:30:13.660
ON SCALE THAT'S EITHER FROM YOU

05:30:13.727 --> 05:30:16.997
FOLKS THE SENATE CALIFORNIA OR

05:30:17.063 --> 05:30:18.698
FROM THE VOTERS.

05:30:18.765 --> 05:30:20.400
PROBABLY IN THE SOUTH COAST AIR

05:30:20.467 --> 05:30:21.401
DISTRICT WHERE CAN WHERE IT CAN

05:30:21.468 --> 05:30:22.936
REALLY VOTE ON SIGNIFICANT SCALE.

05:30:23.003 --> 05:30:23.703
THE THIRD REASON THOUGH I THINK

05:30:23.770 --> 05:30:25.872
IS THE OPPORTUNITY OF REGIONAL

05:30:25.939 --> 05:30:27.541
MEASURE CAN PRESENT. FOR

05:30:27.607 --> 05:30:29.843
CREATING A TRULY CLEAN AIR RAIL

05:30:29.910 --> 05:30:32.546
SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE REGION THE

05:30:32.612 --> 05:30:34.814
METAL EXISTENCE IS A NORMAS

05:30:34.881 --> 05:30:36.683
OPPORTUNITY IS NOT YET IN THE

05:30:36.750 --> 05:30:38.552
BILL WE BELIEVE IT BECOMES AN

05:30:38.618 --> 05:30:39.986
OPPORTUNITY GOING FORWARD WE

05:30:40.053 --> 05:30:40.987
URGENT.

05:30:41.054 --> 05:30:42.489
I THINK THE DISTRICT IS BECOMING

05:30:42.556 --> 05:30:44.457
RECEPTIVE TO THAT BUT THOSE

05:30:44.524 --> 05:30:48.128
THREE REASONS REALLY CLEAN AIR.

REGIONAL -- TRANSIT SYSTEM.

05:30:53.833 --> 05:30:55.735
ONLY SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS CAN

05:30:55.802 --> 05:30:56.803
ACHIEVE THAT LET'S SEE THEY'RE

05:30:56.870 --> 05:30:58.738
GONNA BE SACRAMENTO -- IS GOING

05:30:58.805 --> 05:31:00.473

05:33:33.026 --> 05:33:33.693
OUR SECONDARY WITNESSES WELCOME

05:33:33.760 --> 05:33:34.728
BACK HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK

05:33:34.794 --> 05:33:36.563
YOU -- MEMBERS -- GOOD AFTERNOON

05:33:36.629 --> 05:33:38.631
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY BUT AND

05:33:38.698 --> 05:33:40.800
UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN SUPPORT OF

05:33:40.867 --> 05:33:42.602
THIS BILL IS TO HAVE THAT GOING

05:33:42.669 --> 05:33:44.137
FOR ME AND JUST AND STRAIGHT.

05:33:44.204 --> 05:33:46.139
SO -- WE ARE DEFINITELY OPPOSED

05:33:46.206 --> 05:33:47.374
SB SEVEN THIRTY TWO TODAY AND I

05:33:47.440 --> 05:33:48.541
WANT TO MENTION TWO THINGS THAT

05:33:48.608 --> 05:33:50.076
I MISTER NOW ACTUALLY MENTIONED

05:33:50.143 --> 05:33:51.878
IN HIS VERY ABLE COMMITTEE

05:33:51.945 --> 05:33:54.781
ANALYSIS -- TWO POINTS THAT HE

05:33:54.848 --> 05:33:56.249
RAISED THE FIRST ONE BEING

05:33:56.316 --> 05:33:57.984
PRECEDENCE OKAY THIS IS THE

05:33:58.051 --> 05:33:59.753
FIRST TIME AN AIR QUALITY

05:33:59.819 --> 05:34:01.087
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT.

05:34:01.154 --> 05:34:03.623
HAS AUTHORIZED A TAX OF THIS

05:34:03.690 --> 05:34:05.625
NATURE THIS IS A SENATOR ALLEN

05:34:05.692 --> 05:34:07.927
MENTION ATTACKS THAT ENCOMPASSES

05:34:07.994 --> 05:34:09.963
TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS

05:34:10.029 --> 05:34:10.997
FOUR OF THE BIGGEST COUNTIES IN

05:34:11.064 --> 05:34:12.532
THE STATE THIS IS NEVER BEEN

05:34:12.599 --> 05:34:14.567
DONE BEFORE -- SO THERE'S

05:34:14.634 --> 05:34:16.069
PRECEDENT SETTING NUMBER ONE

05:34:16.136 --> 05:34:17.137
NUMBER TWO WERE TARGETING

05:34:17.203 --> 05:34:19.339
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES

05:34:19.406 --> 05:34:20.874
THERE ARE DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES

05:34:20.940 --> 05:34:23.143
MEMBERS WITH SALES TAXES.

05:34:23.209 --> 05:34:24.577
PARTICULARLY NOW I COUNTY OF ACT

05:34:24.644 --> 05:34:26.279
OR OVER 10%.

05:34:26.346 --> 05:34:28.281
AND YOU KNOW THIS WOULD ADD AT

05:34:28.348 --> 05:34:31.251
LEAST 1% TO THAT AMOUNT -- AND

05:34:31.317 --> 05:34:32.118
THAT RAISES CONCERNS BECAUSE

05:34:32.185 --> 05:34:33.820
SALES TAXES ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY

05:34:33.887 --> 05:34:35.054
REGRESSIVE.

05:34:35.121 --> 05:34:36.423
AND ARE GONNA MAKE THE COST OF

05:34:36.489 --> 05:34:37.891
GOODS MORE EXPENSIVE --

05:34:37.957 --> 05:34:39.759
ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME

05:34:39.826 --> 05:34:40.693
CONSUMERS.

05:34:40.760 --> 05:34:42.462
AND FINALLY MEMBERS WERE

05:34:42.529 --> 05:34:43.830
CONCERNED ABOUT AND EVEN

05:34:43.897 --> 05:34:44.731
BOUNDARIES.

05:34:44.798 --> 05:34:46.199
KIND OF FOR THE REASON THAT I

05:34:46.266 --> 05:34:47.467
MENTIONED AT THE TOP THIS IS A

05:34:47.534 --> 05:34:49.702
ESSENTIALLY FOR COUNTY TAX

05:34:49.769 --> 05:34:53.206
SPENDING TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE --

05:34:53.273 --> 05:34:56.276
TAXES OF SALES TAXES OF THIS OF

05:34:56.342 --> 05:34:57.377
THIS KIND TEND TO BE CONSTRUCTED

05:34:57.444 --> 05:34:58.745
AMONG CITIES AND COUNTIES

05:34:58.812 --> 05:35:00.280
PRIMARILY AND NOT ACROSS

05:35:00.346 --> 05:35:01.781
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND I

05:35:01.848 --> 05:35:10.924
THINK THAT CREATES -- THE

05:35:10.990 --> 05:35:12.459
PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND

05:35:12.525 --> 05:35:13.293
MAKES TAX COMPLIANCE MUCH MORE

05:35:13.359 --> 05:35:15.161
DIFFICULT SO FOR ALL THOSE

05:35:15.228 --> 05:35:15.662
REASONS ASPIRIN ABOUT.

05:35:15.728 --> 05:35:16.563
THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER WOLF WE

05:35:16.629 --> 05:35:17.497
WELCOME OUR SECOND WITNESS IN

05:35:17.564 --> 05:35:18.631
OPPOSITION YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES

05:35:18.698 --> 05:35:20.366
SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS ALL RIGHT

05:35:20.433 --> 05:35:21.000
GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF

05:35:21.067 --> 05:35:21.634
PETER BLOCKER WITH CALIFORNIA

05:35:21.701 --> 05:35:23.536
TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO

05:35:23.603 --> 05:35:24.037
IN OPPOSITION.

05:35:24.103 --> 05:35:25.271
ECHO MANY THE COMMENTS THAT I

05:35:25.338 --> 05:35:26.739
MISS ROTH MADE I'D ALSO ADD THAT --

05:35:26.806 --> 05:35:28.274
IN ADDITION TO AUTHORIZE IN THE

05:35:28.341 --> 05:35:30.777
DISTRICT TO IMPOSE A SALES AND

05:35:30.844 --> 05:35:32.612
USE TAX OR TREES TRANSACTION CAN

05:35:32.679 --> 05:35:34.714
USE TAX -- IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW

05:35:34.781 --> 05:35:37.383
THEM TO GO ABOVE -- 1% ABOVE THE

05:35:37.450 --> 05:35:38.985
2% CAP ON LOCAL TAXES.

05:35:39.052 --> 05:35:40.286
AND THIS 2% CAPS IMPORTANT

05:35:40.353 --> 05:35:42.789
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS A ONE OF

05:35:42.856 --> 05:35:44.824
THE REASONS WE HAVE THAT CAP IS

05:35:44.891 --> 05:35:45.925
NOT ONLY TO EASE COMPLIANCE BUT

05:35:45.992 --> 05:35:47.327
THE PROTECT ACT FAIRS REGRESSIVE

05:35:47.393 --> 05:35:49.829
TAX BECAUSE CALIFORNIA AT SOME

05:35:49.896 --> 05:35:50.930
POINT 25%.

05:35:50.997 --> 05:35:52.465
STATE IMPOSE RATE IS THE HIGHEST

05:35:52.532 --> 05:35:55.268
IN THE COUNTRY -- AND ALSO JUST

05:35:55.335 --> 05:35:57.437
ADD THAT -- WE URGE CAUTION IN --

05:35:57.504 --> 05:35:59.072

05:36:02.509 --> 05:36:05.879
INFLOWS ATTACKS LIKE THIS -- AS

05:36:05.945 --> 05:36:07.347
THE ANALYSIS POINTED OUT.

05:36:07.413 --> 05:36:08.648

WHICH IS VERY HIGH AND THIS

05:36:20.059 --> 05:36:21.461

MIRACULOUS THINGS OVER THE YEARS.

05:37:27.594 --> 05:37:28.127
THERE WELL REGARDED THE VERY

05:37:28.194 --> 05:37:29.629
CAPABLE AS A LOCAL

05:37:29.696 --> 05:37:31.064
TRANSPORTATION AGENCY.

05:37:31.130 --> 05:37:32.265
THERE ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF

05:37:32.332 --> 05:37:33.800
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOBILITY

05:37:33.866 --> 05:37:35.401
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

05:37:35.468 --> 05:37:36.970
AND THEY'RE VERY ADEPT AT

05:37:37.036 --> 05:37:37.570
WORKING WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS

05:37:37.637 --> 05:37:39.472

05:37:45.144 --> 05:37:46.479
BILL.

05:37:46.546 --> 05:37:48.681
WAS AT A FAR REACH FROM THE

05:37:48.748 --> 05:37:51.150
FOLKS WITHIN OUR CTC THAT

05:37:51.217 --> 05:37:53.486
INCLUDES SEVERAL SUPERVISORS AND

05:37:53.553 --> 05:37:54.721
TWENTY NINE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.

05:37:54.787 --> 05:37:56.356
SO THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH

05:37:56.422 --> 05:37:58.124
MORE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE

05:37:58.191 --> 05:37:59.993
SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND

05:38:00.059 --> 05:38:02.829
FOLKS WHO HAVE AN AFFILIATION

05:38:02.895 --> 05:38:04.297
WITH OUR CTC.

05:38:04.364 --> 05:38:06.799
ARE WE BINS SINCE THE BILL WAS --

05:38:06.866 --> 05:38:08.368
VIA HEARD ABOUT AND LAUNCHED IN

05:38:08.434 --> 05:38:10.136
THE FALL WE'VE BEEN REPEATEDLY

05:38:10.203 --> 05:38:11.537
ASKING FOR INFORMATION.

05:38:11.604 --> 05:38:13.873
ARE SUCH THINGS AS WHAT PROGRAMS

05:38:13.940 --> 05:38:17.644
WILL BE FUNDED SUCH THINGS AS

05:38:17.710 --> 05:38:19.345
WELL HOW WOULD BE ENSURE THAT.

05:38:19.412 --> 05:38:21.247
THE INLAND EMPIRE RESIDENTS WILL

05:38:21.314 --> 05:38:22.448
SEE A FAIR SHARE RETURNED

05:38:22.515 --> 05:38:24.250
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE DEALT WITH

05:38:24.317 --> 05:38:25.284
IN THE BILL.

05:38:25.351 --> 05:38:27.487
AND ONCE THE LANGUAGE IS FINALLY

05:38:27.553 --> 05:38:29.389
AVAILABLE WITH UNDERSTAND FOUND

05:38:29.455 --> 05:38:31.090
THAT THERE'S A 6% EXPENSE

05:38:31.157 --> 05:38:34.260
ALLOWANCE WHICH IS VERY UNUSUAL

05:38:34.327 --> 05:38:35.328
FOR THE SELF HELP COUNTY.

05:38:35.395 --> 05:38:37.397
LEGISLATION I WILL POINT OUT AND

05:38:37.463 --> 05:38:38.965
NUMBER SHOULD SHOW MY AGE HI

05:38:39.032 --> 05:38:40.633
HELP RIGHT THE FIRST TO SELF

05:38:40.700 --> 05:38:41.668
HELP COUNTY.

05:38:41.734 --> 05:38:44.270
BILLS IN MID EIGHTIES EIGHTY

05:38:44.337 --> 05:38:44.837
FIVE EIGHTY SIX AND IN BOTH

05:38:44.904 --> 05:38:46.873
CASES THEY HAVE 1%.

05:38:46.939 --> 05:38:48.708
CAPS ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SO

05:38:48.775 --> 05:38:50.743
I JUST PUT PASSED ON AS A

05:38:50.810 --> 05:38:57.083
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER.

05:38:57.150 --> 05:38:59.318
ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS OKAY A THE

05:38:59.385 --> 05:39:01.087
LAST TWO KEY CONCERNS ARE FIRST

05:39:01.154 --> 05:39:03.690
THAT ON BEHALF OF OUR CTC ANYONE

05:39:03.756 --> 05:39:04.924
EMPIRE AT LARGE.

05:39:04.991 --> 05:39:06.659
THERE IS A GREAT POTENTIAL THAT --

05:39:06.726 --> 05:39:08.494
WE COULD BE LEFT OUT BECAUSE OF

05:39:08.561 --> 05:39:09.929
THE MAKE UP OF THE BOARD IN

05:39:09.996 --> 05:39:10.863
TERMS OF MAKING PROJECT

05:39:10.930 --> 05:39:12.699
DECISIONS AND PROGRAM DECISIONS

05:39:12.765 --> 05:39:15.334
SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE THINK

05:39:15.401 --> 05:39:15.902
NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT OUT AND

05:39:15.968 --> 05:39:17.570
TAKEN. TO AND HAVE SOMEONE TAKE

05:39:17.637 --> 05:39:19.405
A LOOK AT AND FINALLY WE HEARD

05:39:19.472 --> 05:39:23.109
RUMORS ABOUT THE METROLINK.

05:39:23.176 --> 05:39:23.643
A LANGUAGE.

05:39:23.710 --> 05:39:25.011
WE DON'T HAVE ANY.

05:39:25.078 --> 05:39:26.412
PERSPECTIVE ONE WAY THE OTHER

05:39:26.479 --> 05:39:28.281
FACT I REPRESENT METROLINX IT'S

05:39:28.347 --> 05:39:30.016
KIND OF AN ODD POSITION VIçT.

05:39:30.083 --> 05:39:31.651
BUT THE POINT HERE IS.

05:39:31.718 --> 05:39:33.152
THAT SEE HEARING ABOUT

05:39:33.219 --> 05:39:34.387
AMENDMENTS THAT AFFECT.

05:39:34.454 --> 05:39:35.955
METROLINK AND YOU HAVE A

05:39:36.022 --> 05:39:37.490
SITUATION WHERE OUR CTC IS ONE

05:39:37.557 --> 05:39:39.525
OF THE FIVE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF

05:39:39.592 --> 05:39:41.828
THE GPA BOARD AND HAS NOT BEEN

05:39:41.894 --> 05:39:43.730
TALKED TO AT ALL IN ADVANCE OF

05:39:43.796 --> 05:39:45.465
THE LANGUAGE BEING PUT ON THE

05:39:45.531 --> 05:39:45.865
TABLE.

05:39:45.932 --> 05:39:48.334
IS HIGHLY IRREGULAR SO WITHOUT I

05:39:48.401 --> 05:39:49.469

05:44:23.709 --> 05:44:24.810
PICTURE.

05:44:24.877 --> 05:44:25.845
THE VOLATILITY PIECE OF

05:44:25.911 --> 05:44:28.180
CALIFORNIA THE UPS AND DOWNS

05:44:28.247 --> 05:44:30.549
IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE WE'VE GOT

05:44:30.616 --> 05:44:31.851
GREAT CHALLENGES IN THE STATE OF

05:44:31.917 --> 05:44:32.918
CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE DOING

05:44:32.985 --> 05:44:34.453
BRILLIANTLY WE JUST SAW THE

05:44:34.520 --> 05:44:36.122
REVENUE NUMBERS ARE GREAT.

05:44:36.188 --> 05:44:37.156
AND I'VE SEEN THESE PATTERNS

05:44:37.223 --> 05:44:38.958
WHERE THINGS ARE FANTASTIC EVERY

05:44:39.025 --> 05:44:40.393
WOULD BE GOING INTO THE BLOWS UP

05:44:40.459 --> 05:44:42.795
AND THEN ITS SHUTDOWN FOR TEN

05:44:42.862 --> 05:44:43.662
YEARS.

05:44:43.729 --> 05:44:44.997
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED

05:44:45.064 --> 05:44:46.599
MONEY FOR AIR QUALITY IS NO

05:44:46.665 --> 05:44:47.233
QUESTION THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE

05:44:47.299 --> 05:44:48.834
DONE.

05:44:48.901 --> 05:44:50.169
EN EN ALL OF YOU YOU KNOW I'M

CONTINUE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION

05:44:53.472 --> 05:44:54.140
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

05:44:54.206 --> 05:44:55.274
APPROPRIATE IN GIVEN THE

05:44:55.341 --> 05:44:56.642
SITUATION.

05:44:56.709 --> 05:44:57.810
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT HERE'S

05:44:57.877 --> 05:45:00.112
ANOTHER GROUP COMING IN SAYING

05:45:00.179 --> 05:45:01.781
HERE'S THE DEAL YOU KNOW AND I I

05:45:01.847 --> 05:45:02.848
BY THE WAY WAS IT WAS A

05:45:02.915 --> 05:45:03.949
CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS.

05:45:04.016 --> 05:45:05.418

SCHOOLS TAKING MONEY.

05:45:09.188 --> 05:45:11.023
OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND THAT

05:45:11.090 --> 05:45:12.024
ABOUT A PROP.

05:45:12.091 --> 05:45:14.493
NINETY EIGHT PAPER SCHOOLS

05:45:14.560 --> 05:45:16.262
BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS SO.

05:45:16.328 --> 05:45:17.596
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT THE

05:45:17.663 --> 05:45:18.431
PEOPLE ARE RIGHT BUT I JUST

05:45:18.497 --> 05:45:19.965
THINK AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO

SAY THAT THE PORT OF OAKLAND

06:23:44.334 --> 06:23:45.502
SUPPORT GIVES THEM THAT

06:23:45.569 --> 06:23:46.636
ASSURANCE.

FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

06:23:55.779 --> 06:23:57.914
DOES NOT IMPACT PORT OPERATIONS

06:23:57.981 --> 06:24:02.152
IN A WAY THAT WOULD.

06:24:02.219 --> 06:24:02.652

06:24:41.825 --> 06:24:43.360
REQUIREMENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

06:24:43.427 --> 06:24:47.631

06:24:57.941 --> 06:24:59.910
THIS BILL.

06:24:59.976 --> 06:25:03.713
WOULD -- SO IF IF THE BILL THAT

06:25:03.780 --> 06:25:05.282

STANDALONE IS SUCCESSFUL -- THEN

06:25:10.720 --> 06:25:12.722
OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BENEFIT THIS

06:25:12.789 --> 06:25:15.926
PROJECT BUT NOT KNOWING -- YOU

06:25:15.992 --> 06:25:17.761
KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE

06:25:17.828 --> 06:25:20.230

06:25:35.879 --> 06:25:36.613
WITH THIS PARTICULAR

06:25:36.680 --> 06:25:38.381
ESTABLISHMENT BUT ADDITIONALLY

06:25:38.448 --> 06:25:41.117
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR A

06:25:41.184 --> 06:25:43.286
FORTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD FOR THE

THE AMENDMENT IN THE BEGINNING

06:25:58.535 --> 06:26:00.937
IT IS IDENTICAL TO THE TO WHAT

06:26:01.004 --> 06:26:04.241
WAS IN SENATOR BELLS BILL --

06:26:04.307 --> 06:26:04.908
WHEN IT CAME THROUGH THIS

06:26:04.975 --> 06:26:06.376

THE HOWARD TERMINAL IS ON THE

06:26:28.832 --> 06:26:30.000
WATERFRONT.

06:26:30.066 --> 06:26:32.269
BUT IT IS NOT DIRECTLY A PORTION

06:26:32.335 --> 06:26:33.937
OF THE PORTS OPERATIONS NOW

06:26:34.004 --> 06:26:35.605

DEVELOPMENT THAT DATE IT WOULD

06:26:44.581 --> 06:26:45.849
IMPACT PORT OPERATIONS.

06:26:45.916 --> 06:26:48.118
NOW CLEARLY AS I STATED BEFORE

06:26:48.184 --> 06:26:49.319
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

06:26:49.386 --> 06:26:50.587

06:26:50.654 --> 06:26:52.055
IT'S ESTABLISHMENT OF FINANCING

06:26:52.122 --> 06:26:53.823
DISTRICT DID NOT GIVE A GREEN

06:26:53.890 --> 06:26:56.026
LIGHT TO THE PROJECT AND THERE

06:26:56.092 --> 06:26:58.128
WILL BE -- THERE WILL BE

06:26:58.194 --> 06:26:59.796
MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES IN

HAVING TO VOTE.

06:27:02.499 --> 06:27:04.367
THAT CAN ADD ADDITIONAL

PROTECTIONS -- TO TO THE PORT

06:27:08.505 --> 06:27:10.106

CERTAINLY EXPECT THEM I WOULD I

06:27:12.475 --> 06:27:14.344
I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE THAT THEY

06:27:14.411 --> 06:27:17.814
WILL BE INCLUDED IN IT IF THIS

06:27:17.881 --> 06:27:19.449
THING MOVES FORWARD.

MONEY INTO THE PORT ACCESS.

06:27:33.330 --> 06:27:35.832

PROJECT -- AND THAT IS PRIMARILY

06:30:38.615 --> 06:30:40.316
THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE

06:30:40.383 --> 06:30:40.784
STATE LANDS COMMISSION

06:30:40.850 --> 06:30:43.119

THE JACQUELINE SQUARE AREA THERE

06:30:59.869 --> 06:31:06.042
ARE A NUMBER OF RESIDENCES.

06:31:06.109 --> 06:31:08.344
BUT WE HAVE AN EXPLICIT.

06:31:08.411 --> 06:31:10.213
A BUFFER ZONE IN THIS TERMINAL

06:31:10.280 --> 06:31:12.582
IS PART OF THE BUFFER ZONE -- IN

06:31:12.649 --> 06:31:14.517
IN AND PASS IT'S BEEN OPERATING

06:31:14.584 --> 06:31:15.185
MARINE TERMINAL FOR SIP TO

06:31:15.251 --> 06:31:16.085
SHORE BUT NOW IT'S STILL AN

06:31:16.152 --> 06:31:17.120
OPERATING MARINE TERMINAL

06:31:17.187 --> 06:31:18.521
ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT HAVE SHIP

06:31:18.588 --> 06:31:19.989
TO SHORE -- WE HAVE A THREE

06:31:20.056 --> 06:31:21.024
HUNDRED THOUSAND DIFFERENT TRUCK

06:31:21.090 --> 06:31:22.392
TRANSACTIONS A YEAR ON THE

06:31:22.458 --> 06:31:23.026
TERMINAL.

06:31:23.092 --> 06:31:23.593
SO IT'S USED FOR DIFFERENT

06:31:23.660 --> 06:31:25.595
THINGS THERE'S A MIX OF USES

06:31:25.662 --> 06:31:27.964
HOUSING IS NEARBY ON THE OTHER

06:31:28.031 --> 06:31:30.233
SIDE OF IT AS A SANDERS SAID ON

06:31:30.300 --> 06:31:32.268
THE TRACKS AND JACQUELINE SQUARE --

06:31:32.335 --> 06:31:34.037
BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

06:31:34.103 --> 06:31:36.940
THE THE EXPANSION OF HOUSING

06:31:37.006 --> 06:31:38.575
USES INTO OUR INDUSTRIAL AREA.

06:31:38.641 --> 06:31:40.310

REASON I ASK IS.

06:31:48.384 --> 06:31:49.485
THE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES TWO

06:31:49.552 --> 06:31:50.854
THIRDS OF VOTERS WITHIN THE

06:31:50.920 --> 06:31:52.188
DISTRICT APPROVED BY INSURANCE

06:31:52.255 --> 06:31:54.757
BUT IF YOU HAVE NO VOTERS.

06:31:54.824 --> 06:31:58.328
SO THE AVERAGE JUST.

06:31:58.394 --> 06:32:00.063
RIGHT YEAH AND THAT THAT'S A

06:32:00.129 --> 06:32:03.299
