COMMITTEE- ALSO THINK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE FOR JOINING US- AS AS SOME OF YOU KNOW- MY BACKGROUND IS AND I'M ELECTRICAL ENGINEER BY TRAINING- I'M ALSO AN EDUCATOR AND FOUNDER OF A NON PROFIT- THAT WORKS TO GET YOUNG GIRLS INTERESTED IN STEM- SO I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN THIS FIELD VERY EXCITED. TO CONTINUE THIS WORK- AS A STATE LEGISLATOR TO- YOU KNOW AFTER BEING ELECTED- I THOUGH THIS FIELD IS ONE OF MY PRIORITIES TO CONTINUE WORKING ON AND WHAT I QUICKLY LEARNED IS THAT WE NEED TO GATHER EVERYONE- THAT'S WORKING. IN THIS FIELD ESPECIALLY COMPUTER SCIENCE- TO LEARN FROM THEM TO SEEWHAT WE CAN DO IN IN CALIFORNIA TO- RECLAIM OUR ROLE AS A NATIONAL LEADER IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- AND SO THAT'S WHY TODAY WHAT ARE THEME IS DEBUGGING COMPUTER SCIENCE IN CALIFORNIA. RECLAIMING OUR ROLE AS A NATIONAL LEADER- IN STAFF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SILICON VALLEY WHICH IS WHAT MADE- CALIFORNIA ON THE GLOBAL LEADER IN STEM BUT STEM IS EVERYWHERE IN OUR STATE IT'S NOT JUST ONLY IN SILICON VALLEY IT'S IN SO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES- AND I THINK A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THEY CAN DO COMPUTER SCIENCE. ANY IN ANY PART OF THE STATE- AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK THAT- WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A QUALIFIED WORKFORCE AND GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE INTERESTED- IN Â•S FIELD- 67% OF ALL NEW JOBS AND STEM- ARE IN COMPUTING. I AND ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE- WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL FOR US IN OUR STATE- TO READ CLAIM A REGGAE JANE OUR LEADERSHIP. IN THIS ROLE UNFORTUNATELY WERE NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARING CALIFORNIANS FOR OPPORTUNITIES ON TO ENTER COMPUTER SCIENCE I'M IN A RECENT STUDY BY THE CAPER CENTER ONLY 3% OUT OF THE ONE POINT NINE MILLION HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ENROLLED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THEN WHAT IN ADDITION WE KNOW THAT THAT 3% IS NOT ETHNICALLY AND GENDER DIVERSE- SO THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENTATIVE OF EVERYONE IN OUR STATE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME- YOU KNOW OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ARE FALLING FURTHER BEHIND AND MISSING OUT ON THESE OPPORTUNITIES- IN STEM AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE VERY DIVERSE- OF GROUP OF PANELISTS SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FROM LABOR- EDUCATION TEACHER THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION RESEARCHERS PRESIDENTS OF UNIVERSITIES- INDUSTRY- WERE ALL HERE TODAY TO SEE WHAT WHAT HOW CALIFORNIA CAN REGAIN ITS ROLE IN THIS FIELD. SO BEFORE MOVING ON TO OUR FIRST PANEL- I WON ACKNOWLEDGE COURSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE AND GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY GIVE A BRIEF OPENING REMARK THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME. THIS IS AN AWESOME SO THIS IS DIAGRAM BUDGET IS IN OUR- FIRST OF DISCOVERED IS THERE IS A ONE LET THEM IN MY CENTER ACTUALLY ON ONCE IT'S ON THE WHAT IS THE AND I DISCOVERY SLATED. STILL. BUT THE IS SOMETHING THAT I REALLY DEEPLY PARTICULARLY IN THE CARE SAID BASICALLY. A VIDEO GAME ON THE ARE FIRED HUNDREDS OF SOFT HERE'S A LOT FOR SO I KNOW ABOUT WHAT JOB SKILLS ARE ANY KIND OF THE CARD WITH THIS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE STORES. THE PROGRAM AND THE SKILLS THAT YOU USE EFFORT A SUCCESSFUL A JOB SO I'M INTERESTED DISABILITY LAST AND ALL TO HAVE A THE CHAIRS AND I REFER THE WORKPLACE ESPECIALLY IF YOU MINISTRY WE'VE GOT. DESPERATELY MORE FEMALE SO. FOR HALF OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO. IS OUR- AND SO WE NEED PEOPLE CREATING THOSE GAMES THAT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN HELP US PUT THE FEATURES IN THE GAMES THAT ARE USEFUL TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE BUYING THEM SO- I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN- PARTICIPATING. THE PANEL AND SING WHICH ALL HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY OBERNOLTE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN AND GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BRIEF WELCOMING REMARK. NO I DON'T THINK- MY COLLEAGUES US NUMBER RIVAS FOR. CONVENING ALL OF US- AND REALLY BEING A LEADER ON THIS CONVERSATION- EVER SINCE YOU GOT ELECTED LEGISLATURE I'VE BEEN HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH YOU. AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH YOU- ON TRYING TO- INCREASE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION AND ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS- THROUGH CALIFORNIA AND- I KNOW THAT. THE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING YOUR OPENING REMARKS SO I HOPE I DON'T REPEAT ANYTHING THAT WAS COVERED BUT- I BET THEY WERE AND- I'M GET WON'T DO THEM JUSTICE BUT WANTED TO- JUST KIND OF HIGHLIGHT. A COUPLE THINGS AND ONE IS THAT WE NEED DATA. AND THE STATE NEEDS GOOD DATA. ON WHO HAS ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE- EDUCATION CURRENTLY IN OUR MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS- AND DATA BROKEN DOWN NOT JUST KIND OF HIGH LEVEL DATA BUT KNOWING. YOUR GENDER ETHNICITY- YOU KNOW IT ARE THE STUDENTS WHO ARE. ARE STEVEN FREE REDUCED LUNCH ME ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT. REAL GOOD QUANTIFIABLE DATA SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE THERE ARE GAPS AND WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT ISN'T. A AND WHAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DO BETTER TO TRY TO INCREASE ACCESS- AND THEN ANOTHER THING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON IS THE TEACHER PIPELINE- AND MAKING SURE THAT. TEACHERS ARE GETTING TRAINED- THAT EARLY ON TO IT SO THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE TEACHING COMPUTER SCIENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS WHETHER IT'S INTEGRATING. C. S. CONCEPTS IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OR ACTUALLY TEACHING COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES- IN HIGH SCHOOL- THAT'S SOMETHING THATWE NEED A BILL THAT PIPELINE AND HAVE IT BE A VERY DIVERSE PIPELINE- SO THAT WE SET THIS FOUNDATION UP PROPERLY- SO THAT EVERY STUDENT GETS ACCESS TO. THE HIGH QUALITY COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION SO LOOKING FOR WORKING ON THOSE ISSUES AND A LOT OF OTHERS- IN THE COMING YEARS. THANKS THANK YOU. SO BEFORE WE OFFICIALLY START I JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS. ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE ENTRANCE TO THIS ROOM. HAS THE AGENDA- AND BACKGROUND MATERIALS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PICK THOSE UP- AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS ONLINE- THE AGENDAS POSTED ON OUR WEB PAGE AND ALL SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS- WILL BE POSTED. WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS- AND AS A REMINDER- TWO SPEAKERS- YOU ALL HAVE FIVE MINUTES- FOLLOWED BY. Q. AND A FROM THE COMMITTEE- SO WE'LL START- WITH THE FIRST PANEL- WE HAVE- ALISON SCOTT. FROM THE CAPER CENTER AND KARAN ROLLER- FROM GIRLS WHO CODE. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS DOCTOR ALISON SCOTT. WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS IMPORTANT MEETING MY NAME IS ALISON COTTON AND THE CHIEF RESEARCH OFFICER THE KEEPER CENTER WERE LOCATED IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA THE HEART OF SILICON VALLEY- AND HAS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN JUST MENTIONED- WE KNOW THAT THE TECH SECTORS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN OUR STATE- HOWEVER THE MOST MARGINALIZED GROUPS SPECIFICALLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE FALLING FURTHER BEHIND I'M AND WE SEE IT ECONOMIC INEQUALITY INCREASING. SO OUR MISSION AT THE KEEPER CENTERS TO FOCUS ON- INCREASING DIVERSITY INCLUSION ACROSS THE TECH ECO SYSTEM SO I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MY TEAM AND I DO OUR CONDUCT CONDUCT RESEARCH ON- ACCESS AND EQUITY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION SO TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE SOME OF THE DATA POINTS THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER- WHY IT MATTERS FOR STATE AND THE OPPORTUNITY THAT I THINK WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US TODAY. SEC WELL. I HAVE JUST A FEW SLIDES OF DATA HERE- SO WE PUBLISHED A REPORT IN JUNE OF TWENTY NINETEEN LOOKING UP FIVE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL COMPUTER SCIENCE. ACCESS ENROLLMENT IN EQUITY DATA- AND THE FINDINGS WERE CONCERNING TO US FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS- FIRST WE FOUND THAT- JUST 39% OF ALL HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA OFFERED. ANY COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE AND THAT NUMBER IS MUCH LOWER FOR THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES. ONLY ABOUT 14% OF ALL HIGH SCHOOLS- AND WE SEE BY THIS THE DARKER SHADES OF- COUNTIES THAT COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES ARE. MOST LIKELY TO BE CONCENTRATED IN THE BAY AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WE FOUND THAT RURAL SCHOOLS ARE SEVEN TIMES LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES. IN TERMS OF ACCESS BY SCHOOL DEMOGRAPHICS- WE FOUND THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS- OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE OR PARTICIPATING COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES JUST BECAUSE THE COURSES ARE NOT OFFERED AFTER SCHOOL THAT THE SAME RATES. SO SCHOOL THAT ARE PREDOMINATELY STUDENTS OF COLOR- ART TWO TIMES LESS LIKELY TO OFFER- ANY COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE AND LOW INCOME SCHOOLS ARE FOUR TIMES LESS LIKELY TO OFFER ADVANCED PLACEMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE A. THIS THAT WAS JUST MENTIONED EARLIER WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WE HAVE- OVER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ONLY 3% OF THEM ARE TAKING ANY CS COURSE- AND EVEN FEWER OF THEM ONLY ONE PERCENT. ARE ENROLLED IN AP COMPUTER SCIENCE AND I REALIZE THAT THE GRAPH ON THE RIGHT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SMALL SO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT A FEW OF THE DATA POINTS THERE- WHEN WE LOOK AT CS ENROLLMENT BY RACE AND GENDER. I'M JUST SIX THOUSAND OF OUR ONE MILLION LET NEXT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE TAKING- AP COMPUTER SCIENCE. THE NUMBER THE LOWER FOR BLACK STUDENTS WHERE JUST FIVE HUNDRED OF OUR- HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND BLACK STUDENTS ARE TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE AP COMPUTER SCIENCE. AND FEMALE STUDENTS 27% ARE TAKING A PCS A- JUST THIRTY NINE BLACK GIRLS AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE LIVE NEXT GIRLS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND- SO WHY ARE THESE FINDINGS SO CONCERNING TO US- A COUPLE REASONS ONE THAT COMPUTATIONAL THINKING AND KNOWLEDGE ARE BASICALLY TO RECEIVE THAT WE KNOW STUDETS WILL NEED ACROSS ALL FIELDS OF STUDY. I'M TO STUDENTS THAT ARE TAKING AP COMPUTER SCIENCE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GO ON A MAJOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- AND BE PREPARED FOR- MAJORING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AT BUT A POST SECONDARY LEVEL. I'M AND THEN ALSO JUST AS A STATE CALIFORNIA NEEDS A DIVERSE AND ROBUST COMPUTING WORK FORCE OUR CURRENT TECH WORKFORCE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT REFLECTIVE OF OUR CURRENT STATE DEMOGRAPHICS- AND- AS A- AGAIN OF THE STATE WHAT WE WILL BE REDUCE THING- INNOVATION AND EXACERBATING INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY OF FOR NOT ADDRESSING THIS KEY ISSUE. SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE HAVE IS AN OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US DESPITE THIS DATA I THINK. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPROACH THESE DISPARITIES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- BY PRIORITIZING POLICIES AND STRATEGIES THAT REALLY ADDRESSED THE- RACIAL GENDER ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC GAPS THAT WE JUST ON THE DATA- I ALSO THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND STRATEGIC ABOUT ADDRESSING. THAT ENTRANCED I COULD NOT- THE EDGE ENTRANCED EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY ACROSS ALL SUBJECT AREAS AT THE SAME TIME- SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING I THINK WE CAN DEMONSTRATE BOLD LEADERSHIP- BY ANSWERING ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE PREPARED FOR. A PARTICIPATION IN OUR FUTURE TACT OF AN ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. K. THANK YOU DOCTOR SCOTT- OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS OUR CURRENT ROLLER- DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY FOR GIRLS WHO CO. I THINK I AM FIRST THANKS A SIMILAR REQUEST FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M VERY EXCITED- TO TALK ABOUT DAVID DAVIS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEART ACROSS THE CODE- SO GROSS A CODE OR ANY YEAR OLD ORGANIZATION- WE WERE FOUNDED WITH THE MISSION TO CLOSE THE GENDER GA. IN ENTRY LEVEL TECHNOLOGY JOBS- WE DO THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST THROUGH OUR PROGRAMS WHERE WE NOTONLY TEACH GIRLS TO CODE- BUT WE GIVE THEM THE SKILLS TO CONFRONT A LOT OF THE CULTURAL STEREOTYPES BUT WHO AND WHAT. OCCURRED LOOKS LIKE- A FEW YEARS AGO YOU KNOW WE STARTED TO SEE THAT THERE IS THIS PROLIFERATION OF POLICIES DESIGNED TO EXPAND. COMPUTER SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS- WE REALIZE THAT TO REALLY FULFILL OUR MISSION OF REACHING GENDER PARITY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- WE NEEDED TO START ADDRESSING THE GENDER GAP IN IN. COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN SCHOOLS. FIRST THING WE DID WAS A WELL LET'S LET'S LOOK AT THE DATA SURELY IT EXISTS- BUT THE TO OUR DISMAY WE REALIZE THAT THE ONLY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA THAT EXISTED WAS THROUGH THE COLLEGE BOARD'S AP PROGRAM- THROUGH PARTICIPATION. COMPUTER SCIENCE EXAMS- YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. ALISON CHIP MENTIONED SORT OF A WHAT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE- BUT ALL OF ALL OF YOU TWENTY. THOUSAND BPD PERCENT EXAMS TAKE LASHER ONLY 30% OF THE WERE GIRL. AND ONLY 8% OF THE WERE ACROSS COLOR AGAIN I'M JUST GONNA AFTER THIS- ONLY FORTY NINE BLACK GIRLS AT THE AP COMPUTER SCIENCE EXAM ACROSS CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL OF THE OTHER- COMPUTER SCIENCE IN COMPUTATIONAL THINKING COURSES THAT ARE BEING OFFERED ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS THE ONLY PUBLIC DATA THAT EXISTS. ABOUT WHAT THE GAPS ARE NOT JUST FOR GENDER BUT FOR RACE FOR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. HOW WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF. WHO'S TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE TO THOSE CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE THE SCHOOLS THAT THERE AND- AND IN POLICY BUT ESPECIALLY IN EDUCATION POLICY WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS MANAGED- IF THERE'S NO DATA ON GIRLS. OTHER UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSROOMS- HOW ARE WE EVER TO KNOW IF THOSE COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE THE SCHOOL BRAND OR- THE COMMUNITIES THURMOND- HOW. WE TO TRULY EVALUATE THE POLICIES- THAT WE ENACTED TO PUT COMPUTER SCIENCE IN EVERY SCHOOL- AND HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW IF ARE WE NOT GETTING GIRLS IN THE FIRST PLACE ARE WE LOSING THEM SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY HOW DO WE REALLY MEASURE HOW WE'RE DOING IT NOT JUST SORT OF THE DIVERSITY ANGLE. BUT ALSO THE INCLUSION ANGLE- BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY- WE ARE SO OFTEN TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY INCLUSION AND THEY OFTEN. YOU KNOW COME ACROSS IN THE SAME BREATH DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION- BUT WE FORGET THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT CONCEPTS- AND FOR DIVERT DIVERSITY IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GETTING MUCH BETTER AND COMPUTER SCIENCE- SO THAT'S- YOU KNOW GETTING GIRLS AND OTHER UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES- EXPOSED TO COMPUTER SCIENCE SPARK THEIR INTEREST I'M GET THEM INTO THE CLASSROOMS AND CLUBS IN THE FIRST PLACE- BUT INCLUSION IS THE MUCH HARDER WORK- AND THAT'S THE WORK OF CREATING PERSISTENCE IN GIRLS TO PURSUE COMPUTER SCIENCE. IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AND AS A CAREER. I'M BUT ALL OF THIS REALLY START WITH DATA EIGHT. I'M IF WE CAN IDENTIFY WHERE THE GAPS ARE WITH A BIG. YOU KNOW WE'RE THEY PURPOSE STAYING. FOR WE DON'T KNOW OF GIRLS SPEAKING. AT AT ALL WE CAN TIME SEEING. TO CLOSE THOSE GUYS. AN IT YOU KNOW YOU BE ASKING YOURSELF WHY. WHY EQUITY YOU KNOW WHY WE EVEN NEED TO BE TRACKING PARTICIPATE WORDS GOING PUT A COULD. SCIENCE AND EVERY SCHOOL IN THE GIRLS WILL COME- BUT IT YOU KNOW FOR US ACROSS THE CODE WE REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS SORT OF BEYOND JUST A YOU KNOW THIS EQUITY LINES WE THINK ABOUT THIS IN ECONOMIC TERMS. AND WE THINK ABOUT THIS AND INNOVATION TERMS- IT FOR STARTERS WOMEN ARE THE PRIMARY BREAD WINNERS AND 40% OF AMERICAN FAMILIES- EVERYONE TALKS A LOT ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW COMPUTER SCIENCE JOBS CODING JOBS PAID YOU KNOW THREE TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THERE SO MANY MORE OF THESE JOBS- AND FOR SO MANY FAMILIES AND FOR GIRLS- THESE ARE JOBS THAT ARE PATHWAYS INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR THEIR FAMILIES IN THE NEXT GENERATION- SO THAT'S YOU KNOW A REALLY PRIMARY CONCERN BEHIND WHY WE NEED TO START TRACKING THIS DATA AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE OUR COMMUNITIES- BUT I ALSO WANT US TO. THINK MORE DEEPLY ABOUT THE INNOVATIONS THAT RELIEVING ON THE TABLE- BY NOT FOCUSING ON THE GAPS- YOU KNOW FOR GENDER FOR RACE FOR SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS ALL OF THOSE- WERE REALLY LEAVING BEHIND. A GENERATION OF CHANGED COURSE WE'RE NOT GIVING THE NEXT GENERATION OF INNOVATORS THE SKILLS THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE THE CHANGE IN THE WORLD. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE LEAVING OUT AT A TIME WHEN YOU KNOW WE NEED INNOVATIONS AND TWIRLED MORE THAN EVER. WE DON'T WANT TO EXCLUDE ANY SEGMENT OF OUR TO MAKE THOSE INNOVATIONS MAKE THEM A REALITY. AND HELP YOU KNOW CHANGE OUR WORLD FOR THE FOR THE- SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CALIFORNIA QUESTIONS. THANK KARAN I KNOW YOU YOU TRAVEL FROM THE I THINK YOU'RE ON THE SPEAKER THAT COME FROM THE FOR THIS I THINK I'M PRETTY SURE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT FOR JOINING US HERE IN OUR STATE CAPITOL ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- SO NOW I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. I HAD A QUESTION FOR- MISS ROLLER- SO I DO WE ARE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT ON THE NEED TO GET MORE WOMEN INTO COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT- I FEAR THAT WE ARE SHORT CHANGING THE EFFORT IF WE FOCUS. IF OUR FOCUS IN THAT EFFORT IS TO. CREATE MORE COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAMS AT HIGH SCHOOLS. WHICH WAS WHAT- DOCTOR SCOTT WAS TALKING ABOUT AND- THAN MOTIVATE WOMEN TO GET INTO THOSE PROGRAMS IT SEEMS OF TO BE WHAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND- IN MY EXPERIENCE CULTIVATING. A PASSION FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE AND FOR PROGRAMMING IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS BEST DONE AN ACADEMIC SETTING. THE VERY BEST SOFTWARE ENGINEERS THAT I HAVE KNOWN IN MY CAREER OR THE ONES THAT. GOT OUT OF BED WANTING TO CODE WENT TO BED WANTING TO CODE YOU KNOW HAD THAT THAT- PASSION DURING PASSION FOR IT AND MOST OF THEM STARTED OUT IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IT WASN'T COMPULSORY AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH AN ACADEMIC SETTING IS. YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE A CLASS EVERY WEEK YOU HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT YOU KNOW YOU ARE FORCED TO DO THIS AND THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM OF COMPUTER SCIENCE CURRICULUM IT'S JUST A FEATURE OF. ACADEMIA THE BEST IN THE TO CULTIVATING A PASSION IS HANDING SOMEONE A BOOK IN A COMPUTER AND SAYING OKAY WHAT HE YOU TEACH YOURSELF HOW TO PROGRAM WORKS THESE DAYS BE AN ONLINE PORTAL OR- KNOW SOMETHING THAT SELF DIRECTED- THERE WAS WITH WITH SOME STRUCTURE TO IT BUT BUT SOMETHING THAT THAT. REQUIRED I THE- HE VOLUNTARY BY AND FROM OTHER WOMEN THAT WERE TRYING TO GET INTO THIS AND SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE ISN'T LIKE ANOTHER PRONG THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED HERE TO MOTIVATE YOUNG GIRLS YOU KNOW TO HAVE THAT PASSION. YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT'S RIGHT- I- YOU KNOW OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT FOR GIRLS- THERE IF YOU SPARKLES INTERESTING PETER SCIENCE. BEFORE THE END OF MIDDLE SCHOOL SHE'S MUCH MORE LIKELY TO CONSIDER IT YOU KNOW TO TAKE IT AS AN ACADEMIC SUBJECT IN HIGH SCHOOL AND- IN A PURSUE IT AND HIGHER AND AS A CAREER- AND SO I AGREE WE NEED TO BE SPARKING GIRLS EARLIER. IN MIDDLE SCHOOL SORT OF LIKE THE LAST POSSIBLE CHANCE WE HAVE- BUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OBVIOUSLY BETTER FOR THAT- I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS ARE THE PLACE WHERE- STUDENTS. GET EXPOSED TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES- AND I THINK THAT EXPANDING COMPUTER SCIENCE AT THE YOUNGER GRADES IS REALLY VITAL- FOR SORT OF SPARKING THAT INTEREST IN SPARKING THAT- YOU KNOW JOY IN CODING AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. ON TO EXPLORE IT EXTRA CURRICULAR LEE OR YOU KNOW IN SCHOOL- AT YOU KNOW IN THE LATER GRADES AS IT GETS MORE COMPLICATED AS THEY NEED MORE- ADVANCED TRAINING IN IT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SORT. OF SCHOOL PROGRAMS- THAT DIRECTLY TEACH GIRLS CODE. THE GIRL SO BUT YOU KNOW MOST AT THIS POINT ARE GETTING EXPOSED TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND LEARNING TO CODE IN SCHOOL- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS- YOU ADD THESE COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES ARE BEING ADDED- THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET GIRLS. INTO THEM AS WELL- SO THERE THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES RULES TO CODE OUT OF SCHOOL- BUT IF THEY'RE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO IT IN SCHOOL- WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA PURSUED THOSE OUT OF SCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES. YEAH I UNDERSTAND LIKE I TILL CAN'T HELP BUT THINKING THAT WITH THEIR SOMETHING MISSING MAYBE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT THAT SPARKS THAT INITIAL INTEREST LIKE. ON CODING COMPETITIONS OR IN A REAL WORLD PROBLEMS THAT ARE OPENED UP TO SOLUTIONS FROM FROM- STUDENTS OR- INTERNSHIPS WHERE WE PARTNER THEM WITH. COMPANIES OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE IT'S NOT I HAVE TO. IT'S SOMETHING WHERE. IS THERE MOTIVATED TO TAKE THAT STEP THEM. YEAH AND WE YOU KNOW WE SEE. GIRLS ALL THE TIME ONCE THEY HAVE YOU KNOW WANT TO HAVE EVEN THE MOST BASIC TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE WOULD SAY THOSE BASIC CODING KNOWLEDGE. THEY WILL THEY WILL THEY ARE SPARKED AND THEY GO OFF ON THEIR OWN WE SEE GIRLS COME OUT OF OUR PROGRAMS- THAT HAVE YOU KNOW JUST A BASIC CODING KNOWLEDGE- AND- THEY GO ON AND THEY SAY OH I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS LANGUAGE IN THIS LANGUAGE. AND THEN THEY ARE BUILDING ALL KINDS OF TOOLS BASED ON PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE SEEING- BASED ON SORT OF THIS LIKE INITIAL SPARK- SO I. I AGREE- AT BUT WE ARE AT IT WHAT YOUR SAYING IS BORN OUT AND WHAT WE SEE GIRLS BUILDING WITH THEIR SORT OF- KNOWLEDGE OF CODING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. THANK YOU CAN I JUST ADD ONE OTHER COMMENT. I'M I ALSO GREEN I THINK. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN IN SCHOOL AND OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE KEPT SEEING TIME AND TIME AGAIN OR STUDENTS WHO GOT. SOME EXPOSURE IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL LIKE COUPON OUR CAMP. AND REALLY WANTED TO PURSUE COMPUTER SCIENCE AND DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER PLACE TO GO IN THE SCHOOL DAY TO CONTINUE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND SO I THINK. THE MORE WE CAN ONLINE THOSE TWO TOGETHER SO SPARKING INTEREST. I'M GETTING STUDENTS I'M INTERESTED IN ENGAGED AND THEN HAVING A PLACE FOR THEM TO- TO ENTER INTO A PATHWAY BEARD- I AGREE BUT I MEAN I THINK THAT. VOTE IN HIS. ON THAT. THERE CAN. PASS THAT'S NOT A NOT A- PATHWAY. AND MAYBE IT'S- YOU KNOW. A COMPUTER PROGRAM AND- THE OUT THEM YOU KNOW. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERMAN FOR LACK OF BREAKING OF THAT FEAR IS AGREEMENT- NO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM FROM MY COLLEAGUE- OUT BUT IT REMINDED ME OF A STORY THAT I'M GONNA STEAL FROM RUN GONZALEZ WHO IS THE FORMER MAYOR OF SAN JOSE- WHO'S NOW THE CO I THINK STILL OF THE HISPANIC FOUNDATION OF SILICON VALLEY. WHO WOULD SAY THAT WHEN HE BE TALKING WITH WITH YOUNG STUDENTS IN EAST SIDE SAN JOSE- AND HE WOULD ASK THEM WHO KNOWS WHAT THE ENGINEER IS- MOST THEM WOULD RAISE THEIR HANDS- AND THEN THE FEW THAT WOULD WOULD SAY THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DRIVE THE TRAIN- AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST AWARENESS- AN OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS. THAT A LOT OF STUDENTS DOESN'T COME IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND FOR IN IN MY DISTRICT. FOR THE KIDS WHO GREW UP IN PALO ALTO THEY'RE BORN WITH AN IPAD IN THEIR HANDS AND THEY'RE DIGITAL NATIVES BUT TO- AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT. IS SPARKED A LITTLE MORE ORGANICALLY WITHIN THEM BECAUSE THEY SEE IT EVERYWHERE AROUND THEM- BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND WHERE. THE PARENTS AND THE- ROLE MODELS IN THE LEADERS. AND THOSE COMMUNITIES DON'T WORK IN INTACT- AND SO THE STUDENTS TO DON'T EVEN KNOW IT EXISTS- AND SO IF YOU. DON'T HAVE IT IN SCHOOL AND IF IT'S NOT COMPULSORY IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM. IT DOESN'T. GET THAT. OPPORTUNITY THAT IS THAT THAT. MARK NEVER GETS. IGNITED AND SO IT IT IS A FINE LINE I THINK. YOU KNOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THAT THE BEST WAY IS THAT ORGANIC WAY. ON BUT A LOT OF COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY NEVER EVEN GET THAT AGAIN OPPORTUNITY. TO BEGIN WITH AND SO HOW DO WE AND OF. EXPAND THAT ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY- THIS IS THE- IS A CHALLENGE NOT THE- ONES WITH A- YEAH AND- TO BUILD OFF OF THAT- BRUNCH TV AT. STANFORD DID A STUDY ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO- ABOUT EXPOSURE TO INVENTORS- AND A CHILD'S LIKELIHOOD TO THEN BECOME AN INVENTOR THEMSELVES- AND- IT. IT VERY CLEARLY SHOWS THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPOSED TO. INVENTIONS AND INNOVATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS CHILDREN ARE. UNLIKELY TO GO ON- TO EVEN YOU KNOW KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THAT POSSIBILITY AS ADULTS- AND SO YOU KNOW JUST THIS EXPOSURE TO YOUNG AGE TO- THE NEXT GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGY THAT. GENERATION OF. HOLES CAN GO ON TO SORT OF CREATE THE STATE. CORRECTION OF MAKERS. OKAY THANK YOU BEFORE WE MOVE ON I WHEN IT KNOWLEDGE- THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS HAS JOINED US THANK YOU FOR JOINING OUR COMMITTEE- AND I HAVE A QUESTION AND- YOU KNOW. A COMMENT TO YOU KNOW I. YOU KNOW I WAS EXPOSED TO COMPUTER SCIENCE WHEN I WAS TEN- THIS IS IN THE EIGHTIES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR- AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE COMPUTERS AT HOME OR MOST OF A STUDENT- AND IT WAS THROUGH SCHOOL AND IT WAS JUST LIKE AN EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITY. IN MY FIFTH GRADE CLASSROOM. I'M A I DIDN'T KNOW AN ENGINEER YOU KNOW MY FAMILY ARE IMMIGRANTS FROM MEXICO- THEY'RE NOT PROFESSIONALS I'M YOU KNOW JUST HARD WORKERS- BUT I HAD. DIDN'T KNOW SCIENTISTS DIDN'T KNOW AN ENGINEER I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THIS WAS A CAREER I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A CLASSROOM ACTIVITY. JUST A FUN ACTIVITY SCHOOL AND REMEMBER THE MOMENT THAT MY TEACHER TOLD ME. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THIS AS A CAREER. WE'LL GET PAID TO THIS. I HAD NO IDEA. THE CLASS I ASSOCIATED WITH SCHOOL BUT IT WAS FN- AND THAT'S WHAT CHANGED. MY LIFE AND MY- MY FOCUS IN IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEN IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS FOCUSING ON HOW CAN I DO THIS. BECAUSE THAT I MEAN I DON'T EVEN KNOW IS A CAREER EVEN THOUGH I WAS DOING IT I WAS PROGRAMMING. AND HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS SOMETHING PEOPLE DID FOR A LIVING- AND ESPECIALLY BACK THEN WE DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF THESE TECHNOLOGY. YOU KNOW DEVICES AND IT WASN'T AS PREVAIL AND OBVIOUSLY AS IT IS TODAY. AND SO JUST SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT INITIAL EXPOSE OUR- EXPOSURE I THINK CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR A LOT OF US THAT ARE FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ARE AND SO THANK YOU- FOR. ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL I HAD A QUESTION. BOTH OF YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LACK OF DATA- THAT WE HAVE DO YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW. WE CAN COLLECT DATA SO WE CAN BETTER IDENTIFY THE GAPS. I WELL. TO START TRACKING IT IS WHERE WE BEGIN I. AS A YEAR THERE AGAIN THERE IS A VERY. YOU'RE A LACK OF DATA ON COMPUTER BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF IT ON COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES AND PARTICIPATION- BROADLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE AP EXAMS- AND SO TO BEGIN JUST START TRACKING- WHO'S TAKING A COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES- AND WHO'S TEACHING THEM- WHERE THEY'RE BEING OFFERED- WE YOU KNOW WE TRIED IT WE WANT TO REALLY START LOOKING AT WHERE THE GAPS ARE FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW GIRLS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BY RACE I SO SHE COULD NOT STOP LANGUAGE LEARNER STATUS- BY DISABILITY STATUS WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING A COMPLETE PICTURE OF WHO'S TAKING THESE COURSES NUMBER SEVEN JET JUST TO LOOK AT IT BY IN THOSE CAPPERS JUST DECIDE RIGHT SO WE TALKED A LOT THE IT UP. FOR YOU BLACK GIRLS IN THE AP COMPUTER SCIENCE EXAM HOW MANY WHAT GIRLS ARE TAKING OTHER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES- THAT ARE IN OUR SCHOOLS WOULD YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW SO I WOULD SAY. THE FIRST IS TO BEGIN TO. IT AT THE SECOND THING IS TO HAVE THAT DATA. BE PUBLICLY REPORTED OUT- YOU KNOW. WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS MANAGE THERE'S SO MUCH DATA ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR SCHOOLS- AND IT'S ONLY THROUGH YOU KNOW HAVING THE DATA BECOME PUBLIC AND HAVING A CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHERE THE GAPS ARE AND WHO IS BEING SERVED AND WHO IS NOT BEING SERVED- THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DESIGN POLICY INTERVENTIONS- TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC- SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW START TRACKING IN IN SCHOOLS AND START PUBLICLY REPORTING THAT. IT OUT SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE CAN BE A CONVERSATION- AT ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE INTERACTIONS NEED TO BE- AND WHERE- BECAUSE THERE'S YOU KNOW WE- HAVE A HUGE. BARGAIN BASEMENT- IN THIS NEW DISCIPLINE IS REALLY EXCITING- BUT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING THIS- WITH AN EYE ON EQUITY- AND WITH AN EYE. ON INCLUSION. DISTANCE AND I JUST ADD TO THAT. SO ORDER FOR US TO DO THIS I HAVE A STUDY THAT WE PRESENTED THE DATA ON WE HAD TO MERGE I THINK IT WAS. THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT DATA SETS SO THE DATA IS BEING COLLECTED AT CD AND- CD HAS BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH AND GIVING US THE DATA- BUT IT'S NOT EASY TO ACCESS AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM IS FIGURING OUT. LIKE TO DISAGREED ALL OF STATE UP. BY DONE BY GEOGRAPHY BY COUNTY. YOU HAVE TO MERGE A LOT OF DIFFERENT DATA SETS SO THAT'S ONE IS TO SIMPLIFY THE WAYS IN WHICH ON THE DAY OF BEING. BOTH COLLECTED REPORTED- IN SECOND- FOR K. THROUGH. SIX WE HAVE VERY LITTLE TO NO DATA ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THOSE CLASSROOMS WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS WE THINK ABOUT EARLY EXPOSURE TO. COME UP THE CAKES ABOUT ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION. YEAH AND SIR ALAN DISCOTEK ONE MORE THING ON. LOS CODE AND- THE PAPER CENTER SHOULD NOW BE THE ONES TELLING THIS. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENING PETER SCIENCE IT CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE TELLING ITS OWN STORY. ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- AND YOU KNOW HI LIVING THE SUCCESSES AND TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. THAT WHERE THERE ARE COMMUNITIES WHERE YOUR SCIENCE CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE THE SCHOOLS- AND LIKE THE COMMUNITIES THAT THERE AND SO- WE- WE SHOULD NOT BE THE ONE TELLING THE STORY AND SO THAT'S WHY I WOULD SAY START WITH TRACKING AND PUBLICLY REPORT THE DATA AND HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THE VIDEO- THANK YOU WILL MAKE NOW MOVE ON. TO OUR NEXT PANEL. OF COMPUTER SCIENCE DEVELOPING A QUALITY AND ACCESS SOFTWARE- SO THIS PANEL WILL FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN PREPARE CURRENT. AND INCOMING WORK FORCE FOR THE GROWING TECH INDUSTRY. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE HOW WE CAN BUILD AN INCLUSIVE PIPELINE SO THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE. OUR FIRST TWO SPEAKERS HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN THE INDUSTRY IN TRAINING. THEIR WORKERS FOR THE NEW WAVE. OF TECHNOLOGICAL SKILLS NEEDED TO STAY RELEVANT. OUR FIRST SPEAKER WILL BE SAYS HAD THE US SAYS THAT IS THE LEGISLATIVE AND POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES. AND THAT WILL HAVE NICOLE RICE FOLLOW HIM I THINK IT'S FOR YEAH. SO WE'LL START WITH A SIDE AND THEN MOVED TO NICOLE. A GOOD MORNING- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- SAYS ARE THE AS REPRESENTING THE STATE BUILDING TRADES CODERS OF CALIFORNIA. KIDDING I GOT PROMOTED RIGHT NOW WE ARE UNIONIZED VOTERS EVERYONE. I SAW THE LOBBYIST BEHIND ME THEY'RE FREAKING OUT. THE IT IS- IT IS A PLEASURE- TO BE HERE IS AN HONOR- A BACK AGAIN WHERE- WITH MY- PARTNER- NICOLE RICE IN THE C. CA- HI WHEN I STARTED AT THE BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL ONE OF THE THINGS I WORK I WAS INVOLVED IN WAS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND ALSO THAT HIGH SCHOOL IN THE PIPELINE TO THE TRADES. BACK THEN- WE WERE LOOKING AT THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION OUR SYSTEM AS A WHOLE AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE ACTUAL SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY OF BEING- ELIMINATED FROM HIGH SCHOOLS- USED TO BE THE VOTE GETTING FOR MANY REASONS THAT- WAS TAKEN AWAY. AND SO WHICH WE SAW WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH INDUSTRY- THE MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OF PRESIDENT AND THE STATE BUILDING TRADES PRESIDENT GOT TOGETHER AND WE SAW SORT OF THE UNIQUENESS OF THE SOME AREAS THAT WE HAVE WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. HE WORKS IN OF. THE OUR AT THE A OF TWENTY SEVEN TO PRINT IS A WHERE WHEN CAREER TECHNICAL AND- WAS ACTUALLY. ALIVE AND WELL AT THE HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM THERE ARE THOSE CANONS WERE EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN YEARS OLD- YOU SEEN NEWS REPORTS ABOUT- HOW APPRENTICESHIP IN CONSTRUCTION BEING A GOOD WAGE JOB IN THE UNIONIZED CONSTRUCTION TRADES. ACTUALLY CAN BE EQUAL TO THE SAME EARNINGS AS A COLLEGE GRADUATE. KEEPING IN MIND A LOT OF THE THAT THAT COLLEGE GRADUATES AND KERR AND ALSO THE% CYCLICAL NATURE OF CONSTRUCTION THEY'RE STILL VERY MUCH COMPARABLE. AND SO- WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR PROGRAMS AND HOW MUCH MONEY WE INVEST INTO OUR PROGRAMS- IT'S OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR STIR GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED IN EVERY ASPECT OF THE STATE. WE BUILD PRETTY MUCH ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THESE ARE NOT THE JOBS OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL WERE BUILDING COMPLEX FACILITIES- WILL BUILDING THE NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS OF TODAY. AND TOMORROW AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRIAL OF FACILITIES ARE STILL KEEP OUR ECONOMY GOING AND SO WHY WERE WERE INVESTED IN THIS PARTNERSHIP IS BECAUSE WE WERE SEEING THAT THE AGE HAPPENED TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD. AND SOMEWHERE THERE WAS A GAP. BETWEEN WHEN A PERSON GRADUATED WORK DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THE RELEVANCE IN THEIR EDUCATION OR OTHER FACTORS. THAT WHEN WE SAW THAT IT THAT PERSON WAS INTERESTED IN ACTUALLY HAVING ACCESS TO A GOOD QUALITY CAREER CONSTRUCTION WE HAVE TO READ MEDIATE A LOT OF ISSUES. SO WE GOT INVOLVED IN THE SAID BACK ON CAREER TACK WAS PRESENT THE AGENT WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD. THESE ARE HIGH QUALITY JOBS. AND SO. THE PARTNERSHIP AS ACTUALLY PRODUCED A LOT OF SUCCESS IT'S BEEN ALIVE AND WELL FOR FIFTEEN YEARS IT'S CALLED THE GET REAL COALITION- IN EVERY SINGLE STATE WIDE SCHOOL BOND WE HAVE INCORPORATED MONEY. FOR CAREER TECHNICAL FACILITIES- AND EDUCATION AT ALL FIFTEEN INDUSTRY SECTORS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REPRESENTS RIGHT THERE SEVERAL THEN WE PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL STAKEHOLDER REPORTS OF COMMITTEES OBJECT CODE CARE OF THE SCHOOLS OF THE FUTURE. THERE'S MORE OUR THERE REPORT THERE WAS FIFTH PAY ANY PAGE OF CARE. AND THE NIGHT ONE DAY IS ONE OF THE WAY WE DID. A THE BOARD GO AWAY AND YOU KNOW THE ONE AND IN A POST SO WE KEEP THAT RIGHT WE AT IT AND HAVE A CON. WITH LAW POLICY MAY AND WORK WITH THE FARM OF IT. NOW EVERY SINGLE BOND HAS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR FACILITIES BUT HOW DO YOU HOW THE FACILITY THAT ACTUALLY DOES NOT HAVE ON GOING FINANCING RIGHT. TO THAT THAT THE FACILITY HAS ADEQUATE EQUIPMENT STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING SO FAST AND IT'S INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF CONSTRUCTION MANUFACTURING AND SO ON AND SO ON. SO WE'VE ALSO WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN PASSING THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND CENTER CRACKED. TODAY'S PRETTY MUCH CT DAY AT THE CAPITOL AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT LATER ON THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE WILL ACTUALLY BE DISCUSSING THE STATUS OF BACKGROUND. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PLUS DOLLARS EVERY YEAR TO ACTUALLY HELP US SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAINTAIN THEIR C. T. COURSES OPEN. THE WITH THE TEACHER PIE. MAKING SURE THAT TEACHERS ARE UP TO SPEED ON ALL THE LATEST COURSES IN TECHNOLOGY SO THAT THEY CAN TEACH KIDS. ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL TALKED ABOUT SIR THAT SPARK AND THAT INNOVATION. AND THAT'S RIGHT IN A LOT OF THESE COURSES CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER OF THAT SPARK INNOVATION THE A LOT OF THESE COURSES CAN ACTUALLY. HELP STUDENTS MAINTAIN THEIR INTERESTS AND EDUCATION. THROUGH A DIFFERENT AVENUE THEY COULD BE LEARNING ALGEBRA BY WORKING LA AT ELECTRONICS BOUTIQUE WORSE. THEY COULD BE LEARNING GEOMETRY BY BUILDING A SHED OR DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THAT ARE INVOLVED IN IN THE SCHOOL- WE PARTICIPATE WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS- FACT I WAS IN A SIZE MAKE- OF HEARING YESTERDAY. AT THE CAPITOL TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES ASSIGNMENTS SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS IN THE OBSTACLES FOR HOSPITALS. AS I WAS DOING MY RESEARCH I CAME UPON AN ARTICLE OF THE- HOSPITAL IN SAN FRANCISCO ON CATHEDRAL HILL. STATE OF THE ART HOSPITAL- TALKS ABOUT BILL BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING WHICH ALL OF OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS USE. OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE MATERIALS. OUTSIDE FILTRATION SYSTEMS FOR ACTUAL CLEAR AIR THAT'S FILTERED INTO THE HOSPITAL AND SO ON AND SO ON AND SO ON HIGHLY TECHNICAL HOSPITAL PART OF WAS. AT THE PROJECT INVITED STE IT'S FROM ON. HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS A CAREER RECORD CATION HIGH SCHOOL SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HASN'T ARE NOT EXPERTS IN THERE. THEY INVITED HIM TO VISIT LA THESE JOBS ACTUALLY THAT. UP AT JOHN OF OUR FOR THE ABSOLUTE OF. YOUR SITE AND THEN DURING SELF. WHAT I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST HERE IS THE STATUS LOW TOWARD A MODEL TWO X. OUR PARTNERSHIP TO OTHER AREA THAT ARE NOT TRADITIONAL PERMISSIONS SO TO HAVE A COMPRENDER SHIP PROGRAM. FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS- REORGANIZING THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM IS COLLAPSING ALL OF THE WORK FORCE PROGRAMS INTO ONE DEPARTMENT CALLED THE- DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND A HIGHER WAGES IT'S GONNA TAKE AWHILE TO GET USED TO WRITE- BUT IT'S INNOVATIVE KIND OF IDEA BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING AT A PARTNERSHIP. AND THE WAY THAT IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL THE BEFORE THE BUILDING TRADES AND ALSO EXPANDING THAT TO NONTRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES SO I WOULD LOOK AT THAT ALSO LOOK AT PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES THAT WE ARE PARTNERED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHERE WE ACTUALLY GIVE THEM THE CURRICULUM THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP THE STUDENTS. WILL BE ITS COLLEGE READY BUT ALSO CAREER READY INTER INTER PRESSURE PROGRAMS AND I THINK INDUSTRY CAN BE VITAL AND ACTUALLY PARTNERING WITH LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS AND SIX EC ESTABLISHING THESE PARTNERSHIP ACCOUNT IS OFFICIALLY WHERE THESE AREAS OF TACK ARE VERY RICH RIGHT AND SILICON VALLEY AND SO THE CALIFORNIA WITH BIOTECH AS WELL SO- LEAVE YOU WITH THAT AND THINK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- AND FOR- YOUR PERSPECTIVE FROM THE BUILDING TRADES AND I HAD THE APPRENTICESHIPS- SO WE'LL MOVE ON- TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER NICOLE RISE SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR- FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION THANK YOU THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER AND EVERYONE. ON THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS SAID IN A RICE CALIFORNIA. AND TECHNO SAYS HE- WE ARE THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND PLUS COMPANIES ONE POINT THREE MILLION EMPLOYEES THAT ARE PART OF OUR MANUFACTURING FAMILY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE A GROSS STATE PRODUCT OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. SO I RECENTLY SAW STAT THAT SAD- IF THE INDUSTRY OF MANUFACTURING WAS IT'S OWN COUNTRY WE BE THE NINTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD SET OUT. SO WE'RE WE'RE PROUD OF THAT- I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT NOT ONLY IS IT A PLEASURE TO COME HERE AND SPEAK BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ON ON THIS ISSUE- IT'S ALSO OUR HONOR AND PLEASURE TO BE A PART OF THE PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE GET REAL COALITION AND KOBE CHAIRING NOT WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES THE DANGER OF US SHARING THE SAME MINDSET ON THIS ISSUE IS THAT WE SHOULD BUT WE ARE STILL EACH OTHER TALKING POINTS SO. SAYS ARE HAS NOT SAID A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I WILL ECHO- IN FULL IN STRONG AGREEMENT AND RELATED TO WHERE WE ARE WE'RE WE'RE GOING ON THIS ISSUE. THERE'S JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS THOUGH I WANT TO ADD RELATED TO STEM- BECAUSE I WHEN I WAS PRIVILEGED TO GET THE INVITE TO COME HERE AND SPEAK. I WENT BACK TO MY MEMBERSHIP WE TALK A LOT ABOUT CTP BUT WE DON'T TALK SO MUCH ABOUT STEM IN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. AND SO I WANTED TO. GO TO MY- MY INDUSTRY FOLKS AND CHALLENGE THEM TO TELL ME YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE CORRELATION BETWEEN STEM AND MANUFACTURING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPUTER SIZE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. YOU KNOW HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT DELIVER THE PROPER MESSAGE TO YOU ON THIS BODY POLICYMAKERS. AND THE FIRST THING BY GOD RESOUNDING FROM EVERYONE IS. NICOLE STEMS NOT JUST FOR IT IS NOT JUST FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE STEM IS LIKE THIS CENTRAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF BASICALLY ALL CAREERS INCLUDING MANUFACTURING DEFINITELY **** ARE SAID WITH THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. CULINARY ARTS WELL BEING- AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON SO IT IS REALLY THAT FOUNDATION IN THOSE FOUR DISCIPLINES OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY. ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS THAT REALLY HELPS THE STUDENT BUILD FROM THERE. THE SECOND POINT THAT THEY SHARED WITH ME IS THAT STEM IS SYNONYMOUS WITH C. T. E. WORD. ABOUT HOW DO WE BETTER DELAY THIS DO WE- AND RETAIN INTEREST IN IT HOW DO WE GET WOMEN HOW DO WE GET POPULATIONS OF COLOR INTERESTED IN IT. IT'S THE INTEGRATION WITH CAREER TECH EDUCATION BECAUSE CAREER TECH EDUCATION BRINGS THAT DIED- WORK BASED LEARNING AND THAT RELEVANCY TO THE EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND STAMMER BRINGS THOSE DISCIPLINES AS WELL AS THE ACADEMIC. OF PHILOSOPHY IF YOU WILL THAT'S ON TOP OF THAT AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THOSE TWO YOU GET A VERY POWERFUL ON EDUCATION EXPERIENCE THAT CAN A WEEK SOMETHING LIKE IT DID WITH YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. IN A STUDENT AND HELP CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR CAREER ASPIRATIONS SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT IN THE MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY REALLY WANTS TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT. THINK ABOUT STEM A LOT MORE BROADLY. THINK ABOUT STEM IS NOT JUST AN ACADEMIC PURSUIT BUT ALSO ONE THAT INCLUDES CAREER TECH EDUCATION AND ALSO THINK ABOUT STEM IS NOT STARTING. AT FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY AND A POST SECONDARY ENVIRONMENT THINK ABOUT STAND BEING INTEGRATED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE EDUCATION EXPERIENCE IT WAS JUST TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- ABOUT THE- KIND OF APTITUDE THAT STUDENTS ARE COMING IN TO SCHOOL WITH. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW CHILDREN WHO HAVEN'T EVEN STEPPED INTO A CLASSROOM YET THERE ARE MORE PER SESSION IN TECHNOLOGY THEN WE ARE. YET STILL WHEN THEY GO INTO THAT CLASS ROOM IT'S NOT INTERACTIVE ANYMORE WE TAKE THE INTERACTIVE DEVICE THAT THEY PLAYED WITH WHY MOM WAS IN LINE AT THE GROCERY STORE OR THEY WERE WAITING IN LINE AT DISNEYLAND. AND WE TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM AND WE GIVE THEM A BOOK. THAT I EVEN USE THIS YOU CAN'T TOUCH THE PAPER AND GET THE DEFINITION OR GET THE REAL LIFE APPLE. SO WERE FOR ABOUT A KATIE A EN BY ANY TWO. WE WERE NEED TO THINK OF. HOW ALL DO LIVE DURING THAT EDGY. ASK ME I HAD THE SERGEANTS PASSAGE INFORMATION AND THAT EXT ARE INTO. AND WHAT WEEK. I IN THIS SPACE AS FAR AS A CAREER PATH. FOR STUDENTS AND IT TALKS OF OUR WHITE PAPER WHY. MANUFACTURING WE THINK THE IMMENSE THEM STANDS FOR MANUFACTURING AND WE KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T STAND FOR JUST MAIL. SOURCES ARE. AND WHY IT'S SO NECESSARY IN OUR INDUSTRY TO HAVE STEM BE A PART OF WHAT OUR STUDENTS ARE LEARNING THANK YOU THANK YOU NICOLE SO WE HAVE TWO MORE SPEAKERS AS PART OF THIS PANEL SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD EITHER SIT ON THE SIDE BECAUSE- AFTER THEY- PRESENT. WILL DO THE QUEUE IN A FOR THE FULL PANEL- SO PLEASE DON'T GO ANYWHERE SAYS THAT NICOLE. YES YES WE ALL HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU- BUT WE'RE GOING TO LET THE- FINAL TWO SPEAKERS OF THIS PANEL- PRESENT AND THEY WILL OPEN IT UP TO Q. AND A FOR THE FULL PANEL SO NEXT WE GET TO HEAR FROM THE TECH INDUSTRY- CAMERON DIMITRI IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE- CALIFORNIA. AND THE SOUTHWEST FOR TECHNET. THANK YOU CAN. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND- GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND- AS I SAID FROM THE BEGINNING I JUST REALLY GRATEFUL THAT THIS CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING AND WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH A NUMBER OF YOU AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A- REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE FORWARD AND SO THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS MEETING. MY NAME IS CAMERA DIMITRI AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF TECHNET. AYE TECHNO IS THE NATIONAL BIPARTISAN NETWORK OF INNOVATION ECONOMY CIOS IN SENIOR EXECUTIVES. ARE DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP THINK OF IT THIS WAY IS SOME OF THE MORE ICONIC START UPS TO- THAT THE BIGGEST COMPANIES THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE COVER THE RANGE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMMERCE THE SHARING AND GIG ECONOMIES- THE ADVANCED ECONOMY TELEHEALTH CYBERSECURITY VENTURE CAPITAL. FINANCE AND FILL IN THE BLANK. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH FIRST THANKING YOU FOR CONVENING THIS MEETING. AND DISCUSSING THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THE PRIVATIZATION OF STEM. IN THIS MOST RECENT ANNOUNCED STATE BUDGET. COMPUTING IS THE FASTEST. GROWING AND HIGHEST PAIN AND LARGEST SECTOR OF THE JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES I IN PARTICULAR IN CALIFORNIA IN EVERY INDUSTRY AND IN EVERY STATE. EVERY TWENTY FIRST CENTURY STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO LEARN ABOUT ALGORITHMS AND HOW TO MAKE APPS OR HOW THE INTERNET WORKS. SOON SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THESE THINGS FOR POTENTIAL CAREERS BUT EVEN IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO PURSUE A CAREER IN COMPUTER SCIENCE THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE USERS OF TECHNOLOGY. EVERY PERSON WILL INTERACT WITH SOME TYPE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE WERE TACK IN THEIR DAILY LIVES WHETHER WHEN YOU GO INTO THE CAR WHEN USING YOUR OWN CELL PHONE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS MENTIONED BEFORE IS STUDENTS AND INDIVIDUALS KNOW HOW TO USE THEIR TAX. I WITH MORE THAN. FOUR THOUSAND OPEN COMMUTING COMPUTING JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND LESS THAN HALF OF ITS PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ACTUALLY OFFERING THIS FUNDAMENTAL SUBJECT. THERE'S A CLEAR GAP THAT EXISTS IN OUR CURRENT STEM PIPELINE. CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY UNABLE TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR SKILLED ENDEAVORS TECH WORK FORCE. AND THIS THREATENS OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH COMPETITIVENESS INNOVATION INEQUITY. EDITION AS YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE DR AT DOCTOR SCOTT- THAT STATISTICS REGARDING THE GAPS IN GIRLS AND UNDERREPRESENTED PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE CS PIPELINE IN CALIFORNIA IS DEEPLY TROUBLING. AND COMPOUNDS IS ALREADY SHORTAGE AND EXISTING CS WORKERS. TECHNO MEMBER COMPANIES UNDERSTAND THIS IMPORTANCE AND WE'VE BEEN PROACTIVELY ENGAGED- FROM- PHILANTHROPIC STANDPOINT COMPANIES LIKE DEMOCRAT COMPANIES LIKE MICROSOFT DEMONSTRATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO EXPAND IN EQUITY AND ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE THIEL'S TEO'S WHICH STANDS FOR TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION AND LITERACY AND SCHOOLS. CONNECTS CLASSROOM TEACHERS WITH TECH INDUSTRY VOLUNTEERS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE CS PROGRAMS AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU CAN TO KICKSTART THIS CONVERSATION OUTSIDE OF THAT THE NORMATIVE CLASSROOM SETTING. I'LL MICROSOFT ALSO AS PROGRAMS LIKE DID YOU GIRLS WHICH IS AIMED AT MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS THIS FOCUS PRIMARY PRIMARILY ON PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH BETTER IDEAS OF WHAT A CAREER IN TECH COULD LOOK LIKE FOR WOMEN. I AND THEN PROVIDING WITH MENTORS AND- REAL LIFE EXAMPLES OF WOMEN THAT ARE IN THESE POSITIONS OF POWER SO THE GIRLS CAN EMULATE THESE INDIVIDUALS. OTHER COMPANIES SUCH AS MICROALGAE APPLE HAVE EMPHASIZED CODING AS A CREATIVE ACTIVITY THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE EVERYONE CAN CREATE. WHICH TEACHES STUDENTS. TO DEVELOP AND COMMUNICATE IDEAS. THROUGH VIDEO PHOTOGRAPHY MUSIC AND DRY ANSWER THINKING I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE THAT CREATIVE CAPACITY BECAUSE EVERY TIME PEOPLE THINK OF CS THEY THINK OF YOU KNOW HARD SCIENCE BUT- AS WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN EMBED A LOT OF CREATIVE COMPONENTS WITHIN. COMPUTER SCIENCE. APPLE IS ALSO COMMITTED TO EXCESS ABILITY ACROSS THE BOARD TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND IS MADE MANY EFFORTS. TO MAKE CODEINE EDUCATION AVAILABLE TO BLIND AND DEAF STUDENTS. THROUGH THEIR EVERYONE CAN CODE INITIATIVE. TRANSACTION PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS ONLY ONE COMPONENT OF THIS- OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR VOLUNTEERISM OR NOT THE FIX ALL SOLUTION AS WE THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE. BROADER SYSTEMIC POLICY SOLUTIONS AND SEARCH FOR THIS READ TECHNO IT'S BEEN VERY PROACTIVE AND COLLABORATING WITH THIS YES FOR CA COALITION. IN AS MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT GROUP ALREADY. THE GOAL OF THIS PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION IS THAT EVERY STUDENT DESERVES A CS EDUCATION THAT WILL GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. REGARDLESS OF THERE'S A CODE THE RACE GENDER AND THEIR ECONOMIC BACKGROUND. I WOULD NEED A MULTI FACETED APPROACH THAT CONTINUES TO BUILD OFF OF THAT WELL IT DOWN A LOT DURING THE STATE'S BOARD OF. THE DOT. FOR CAN SCIENCE TWENTY XIN PLAN. THIS IS YES DEVELOPMENT O THE K. THROUGH TWELVE. I JUST WILL HELP SOME THAT. KIND OF THE CRUX OF THE ISSUES THAT WE THE C. PIPER ISSUE. REGARDING PREPPING TEACHERS COUNSELORS AND ADMINISTRATORS WITH MORE CS PROFESSIONAL PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDING INTEGRATION OF CS. IN OTHER FIELDS IN STUDIES AT THE PRE SERVICE LEVEL- INTEGRATING COLLEGE AND CAREER PATHWAYS THAT THEY DID NOT SO SIDE LOAD BETWEEN C. T. AND- TRADITIONAL NORMATIVE EDUCATION. AND ADDRESS IN CS- CREDENTIALING ISSUES WHETHER THROUGH SUPPLEMENTARY AUTHORIZATIONS OR EVEN. THROUGH THE CREATION OF AN EVENTUAL CS SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS YOU KNOW WE'RE RUNNING SHORT ON TIME IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SUM UP. AND SO WE CAN MOVE ON TO I JUST SPEAKER YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST. TECHNO WE BELIEVE CS EDUCATION IS A CRITICAL FOUNDATION AND WE WANT TO DO WHAT WE CAN IN OUR POWER TO BE ABLE TO EMPOWER THAT AND THROUGH IT. THROUGH THE CREATION OF EDUCATION POLICY THAT AMERICA. THANK YOU THANK YOU CAMERA ARE NOW SPEAKER IS JULIE FLAP IN CO DIRECTOR FOR CS FOR CALIFORNIA AND DIRECTOR OF THE UCLA. CS EQUITY PROJECT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMORY OF US FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND HOSTING THIS STEM COMMITTING HEARING ALSO I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN OBERNOLTE. AND PETRIE-NORRIS FOR BEING HERE AND BEING OPEN TO HEARING ALL OF THE WONDERFUL INFORMATION THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SHARED. I'M MY NAME'S JULIE FLAP AND I SAID AT THE INTERSECTION OF POLICY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE. THE LEADER OF THIS AND ARE ACCESS- UCLA COMPUTER SCIENCE EQUITY PROJECT. AND I ALSO COOLEY THE COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR CALIFORNIA. COALITION SO. I REALLY WANTED TO START WITH- WHY ARE WE HERE WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE WIDE IS COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION MATTER. AND EVEN THOUGH I'VE LISTED THESE AS ONE TWO THREE THERE CERTAINLY NOT MEANT IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE BUT REALLY- THERE SO INTEGRATED AND ONE IS SOMETHING THAT WE- HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE OF MEETING. THIS INCREASED DEMAND FOR SKILLED WORK FORCE. AND THAT WE ALSO NEED TO SPUR INNOVATION THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY GAPS WHEN WE LOOK AT INNOVATION OUTCOMES IS WHO HOLDS PATENTS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THEIR HUGE DISPARITIES AND SO- HOW DO WE FOSTER A SPIRIT OF INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY. SO THAT- WE HAVE MORE- CREATIVE PRODUCTS. AND THEN THE ON THE THIRD IS THE HIGH INCOME POTENTIAL WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE THE FASTEST GROWING AND HIGHEST PAID JOBS. THE IMPERATIVE HAS TO DO WITH A G. AND AGAIN IT'S REALLY RELATED BUT COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION HOLDS THE PROMISE. TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE CAREERS AND ALSO SOMETHING THAT GETS SHORT SHRIFT IN THESE CONVERSATIONS IS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT HOW DO WE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE. IN OUR DEMOCRACY USING TECHNOLOGY AND HOW DO WE THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED FOR GOOD- A COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION ALSO HELPS IMPROVE. OUR COMPUTATIONAL THINKING CRITICAL THINKING AND COLLABORATION WHICH ARE REALLY THE FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SKILLS FOR THE WORK FORCE. AND K. TWELVE ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IS ALSO LINKED TO CS COLLEGE MAJORS WHICH HOLDS MORE PROMISES STUDENTS FURTHER REFINE THEIR INTEREST IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. AND THE EQUITY IMPERATIVE. REALLY CONNECTS BOTH THE ECONOMIC IN THE EDUCATION IMPERATIVE AND THAT IS THAT WE NEED TO BE MORE MINDFUL ABOUT HOW WE INCREASE THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR- THERE'S RESEARCH FROM THE MACKENZIE- COMPANY THAT A DIVERSE WORKFORCE. ACTUALLY PRODUCES BETTER SOLUTIONS- WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE MORE VOICES AT THE TABLE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND ALSO- IN THE PLANNING ROOM AS WE DEVELOP MORE CREATIVE PRODUCTS. AND HOW DO WE DEVOTE USE TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO HOW CAN THIS INCREASED ACCESS INTERRUPT THE- THE INEQUITIES THAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY. SO OFTEN TIMES WE THINK ABOUT CAREERS AND TECHNOLOGY AND- NOT WE THINK ABOUT CAREERS IN THE TECH INDUSTRY AND I THINK WE WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL THAT WE HIGHLIGHT THAT THESE CAREERS ARE MUCH BROADER THAN JUST IN THE TECH INDUSTRY. BUT COMPUTER SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE IS INCREASINGLY NEEDED WHETHER STUDENTS PURSUE WITH THE ARTS ENTERTAINMENT FINANCE HEALTH CARE AGRICULTURE AS MY COLLEAGUES NOTED ALL OF THE- INTERSECTIONS IN THE TRADES AS WELL. SO COMPUTER SCIENCE IS ACTUALLY A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LITERACY WE'RE NOT PURSUING COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE THINK EVERY STUDENT SHOULD BECOME A COMPUTER SCIENTIST JUST LIKE WE DON'T. HAVE EVERYONE STUDY BIOLOGY BECAUSE EVERYONE SHOULD BECOME A BIOLOGIST BUT THESE ARE FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS THAT WE SHOULD ALL HAVE SOME EXPOSURE TO. AND SO THESE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SKILLS CAN EASILY BE FOUND IN HIGH QUALITY COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION CLASSROOMS. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THIS- THE COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR CALIFORNIA COALITION IS MADE UP OF EDUCATORS INDUSTRY ADVOCATES- NONPROFITS POLICY ADVOCATES MANY OF WHOM ARE HERE TODAY AND I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE. FOR BEING HERE- WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE TAKE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO HELP DRIVE OUR ECONOMY TO HELP INCREASE EQUITY IN EDUCATION. AND HOW TO CREATE THAT PIPELINE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST SAY YES WERE ON BOARD WITH COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT WE NEED TO DIG A LITTLE BIT DEEPER AND SAY WHAT IS SOME OF THE UGLY STUFF BEHIND THE SCENES THAT WE HAVE TO UNPACK. IN ORDER TO PRIORITIZE EQUITY AND CREATE A SOLID FOUNDATIONAL STRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER HIGH QUALITY COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AND THAT MEANS COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT PREPARES KIDS FOR COLLEGE CAREERS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SO WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS- AS CAMERON NOTEDWE'RE WORKING ON ISSUES AROUND TEACHER CREDENTIALING HOW DO WE PREPARE TEACHERS TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE STUDENTS AND CURRICULUM. HOW DO THEY LEVERAGE- THAT PHONE THE CURRENCY THAT STUDENTS ARE USING IN THEIR EVERYDAY COMMUNICATION AND SAY OKAY LET'S NOT PLAY ON THE PHONE HOW DO WE PROGRAM THE PHONE HOW DO WE USE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT STUDENTS ARE ENGAGED IN EVERY DAY. AND SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL TO THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SO WE'RE WORKING ON BUILDING THIS THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT COMPUTER SCIENCES EQUITABLE SCALABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT IN DOING THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR A PARTICIPATING- NOW I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN- THE- BACK UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OF ALL THE FOUR SPEAKERS- THAT WERE ON THIS PANEL. IF ANYONE. OKAY I'LL START WITH AS A MEMBER P. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND THANK YOU ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US FOR THIS REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION- IT WAS GREAT TO HEAR ALL THE PERSPECTIVES. AND ALSO I THINK IT WAS GREAT TO HEAR THAT FOLKS THAT ARE PRETTINESS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES HAVE THE SAME PERSPECTIVE IN A SHARED PERSPECTIVE. THE AS WE ALL KNOW TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT- IT MANY OF THE JOBS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING IN TEN YEARS DON'T EVEN. EXIST TODAY AND AUTOMATION IS COMING FAST ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS COMING FAST AND OUR TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN WORLD HOLDS BOTH A TON OF PROMISE AND ALSO A TON OF CHALLENGES AND- YEAH I THINK. WHEN WE'RE FACED WITH THAT PIECE OF CHANGE AND THAT SCOPE OF CHANGE THE RESPONSE CAN OFTEN BE FEAR. RIGHT THERE CAN BE A DESIRE TO RESIST THAT CHANGE TO TRY TO STOP IT TO LEGISLATE AGAINST IT TO. KNOW LEGISLATE AGAINST JOB LOSSES AND- I THINK WHEN WE SEE THAT FEAR RESPONSE WHEN WE'RE ACTING FOR A PLACE OF FEAR. WE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES SAYS MY QUESTION FOR EVERYONE IS. HOW CAN WE- BECAUSE HOW CAN WE HELP MOVE FROM AS A REACTION OF FEAR AND HELP PEOPLE. APPROACH THIS CHALLENGE THESE OPPORTUNITIES WITH A VIEW THAT SAYS. LET'S ENSURE THAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR THIS FUTURE LET'S ENSURE THAT WERE BEING THOUGHTFUL AS WERE PLANNING. AND LET'S ENSURE THAT WE ARE CREATING AS MUCH OPPORTUNITY AS POSSIBLE FOR ALL THE EXTRA RISE AS SAD. AS AS OUR JOB ELEGIES CHANGE. LEFT HERE FOR ME OKAY. THAT A THAT'S A QUESTION I THINK SOMETHING THAT- FOR ME I LOOK BACK AT AT HISTORY THE HISTORY OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND- HOW APPRENTICESHIP ACTUALLY WAS CREATED AND WHAT- CONTINUES TO BE. SURE THE EXISTENCE OF UNIONS THAT WERE ORGANIZED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY. AND THROUGH DIFFERENT CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY- THROUGH THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THROUGH. THE SORT OF YOU KNOW THE GREATEST SORT OF MANUFACTURING THE CALIFORNIA- WITH ALL THE AEROSPACE AND- YOU KNOW JUST SO MUCH HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA THAT THAT CHANGED AND SO MANY JOBS- HAD TO BE SORT OF ADAPTED SO MANY CRAFTS. LOOKED AT THE TRAINING ANTICIPATED TO PREPARED THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TODAY- WE HAVE THIS SO EVOLUTION THAT TAKES PLACE- IT HAS TO BE AN EVOLUTION IN OUR CLASSROOMS BROSSEAU IN OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE ARE BUILDING THE STATE OF THE ART FACILITIES. WE HAVE A JOURNEY PERSONS THAT COME BACK AND HAVE TO RE SKILL AND RETRAIN. I THINK SO THAT IS HAPPENING- I THINK THERE'S SORT OF A GLOBAL SUGAR FEAR OF THE ACCELERATION OF HOW MUCH TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING FASTER THAN IT EVER HAS BEFORE- WHAT WE VIEW IS THAT TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE ASSISTING PEOPLE TODAY. AND ACTUALLY DO HAVE A BETTER JOB AND HAVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE DOING THEIR JOB AS WELL MAING IT SAFER NOT NECESSARILY REPLACE. AND SO IF THERE IS GOING TO BE- A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF AUTOMATION THEN I LOOK AT IT WILL CAN WE THEN BUILD THE AUTOMATION MACHINES CAN WE THEN OPERATE THEM CAN WE- PROVIDE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES HERE TO KINDA. OFFSET WHAT COULD BE A REPLACEMENT OF SOME WORK SO THAT THERE IS NO LEAKAGE- PARTICULAR BECAUSE CALIFORNIA INVEST SO MUCH INTO THIS I THINK THAT. THERE'S A- GOOD SORT OF WAY TO LOOK AT EDUCATION AND HOW IT TIES TO BUSINESS HOW TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESS TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO HOW TO REWARD THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING BY HIRING WORKERS PAYING WORKERS ARE RIGHT WAGES. AND IMPROVING THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AS WELL SO I KNOW IT'S AN ONGOING THING IT'S TIED TO OTHER ISSUES AS WELL. TIED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WITH POLICIES THERE BUT- THIS IS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE THAT I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ON. SELECT PSYCHIC. THERE'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER TO UP SKILLED WORKERS AND TO CREATE NEW AND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE STATE I THINK. NUYS MR DIMITRI YOU POINTED OUT. WERE ALREADY KIND OF FEELING THE BITE FOR. A JOB FIRST IT'S NOT PREPARED FOR THE NEEDS OF THE MARKET WE ARE SEEING JOB GROWTH SLOW. NOT BECAUSE WERE FIRING PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AVAILABLE JOBS THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE. ARE NOT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SKILLED WORKERS TO MEET THOSE NEEDS SO. THAT TO ME WHILE THERE'S A TON OF RISK FOR IT IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. THAT TO ME SAYS THERE'S A TON OF OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. CONTINUE TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IN BETTER JOBS AND ALSO TO CONTINUE TO GROW THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND ENSURE WHERE. A GLOBAL LEADER. ASSEMBLYMEMBER I HAD A QUESTION FOR CISAR I THOUGHT YOUR COMMENTS ON APPRENTICESHIP WERE 1100% SPOT ON. I THINK WE NEED MORE FRIENDSHIPS AND MORE INTERNSHIPS BECAUSE WE CAN USE THOSE TOOLS TO TAKE A LARGE POOLS OF PEOPLE AND IDENTIFY THE ONES THAT US. A CAREER IN COMPUTER SCIENCE IS APPROPRIATE FOR AND GIVE THEM THEIR OPPORTUNITY WHERE AS YOU KNOW THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY IN OTHER SETTINGS BUT THERE'S SOME UNIQUE LEGAL CHALLENGES. IN CODING THAT MAKE APPRENTICESHIPS INTERNSHIPS MORE DIFFICULT I WANTED I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE- I MEAN WE ADVICE DID YOU USED TO HAVE INTERNSHIPS. AND WE HAD TO STOP DOING THEM BECAUSE- WHEN YOU'RE CREATING SOFTWARE- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CODING ARE CREATING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND YOU NEED A CLEAR CHAIN OF OWNERSHIP FOR THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE CREATING A SOFTWARE FOR A CUSTOMER. YOU HAVE TO WARRANT TO THEM THAT YOU HAVE COMPLETE OWNERSHIP OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE DEVELOPING FOR THEM AND IF YOU'RE CREATING A FOR AN END USER- IF YOU CAN'T YOU COULD OPEN UP YOU KNOW THIS THIS PRODUCT THAT YOU INVESTED TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEVELOPING- TO BEING PULLED OFF THE MARKET IF ONE- CLAIM OF. OF INFRINGEMENT WE WERE TO COME UP SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE THIS CHAIN OF OWNERSHIP SO THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THAT DO CODING. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S A WORK MADE FOR HIRE AND IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE PAYING THEM AND EXCHANGE FOR A FAIR WAGE THEY'RE GIVING YOU THERE THE PRODUCT OF THEIR WORK AND I MEAN THE PROBLEM WITH INTERNSHIP OR THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID OR PARTNERSHIP FOR SOMEBODY ELSE IS PAYING ON THEM. THIS YOU DON'T HAVE THAT CLEAR CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP SO I WONDERED IF YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON ON. YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME CHANGES WE CAN MATER TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO OVERCOME THOSE DIFFICULTIES AND EXPAND THOSE PROGRAMS. I THINK YOU STOP ME ON THAT ONE I MEAN. THAT'S A- HI I HAVE. YOUR COMMON I I'D I'D I DO THINK. A PARTNERSHIP CAN BE USE A NONTRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES I THINK THERE'S A- CLEAR PATH TOWARD PREPARATION TO. OPEN IT UP FOR DIVERSITY AND JUST. YOU BRING PEOPLE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE- ACCESS TO A LOT OF THESE RESOURCES BUT- BUT WHAT YOU'RE MENTIONING THERE- I'M NOT SURE BUT IT IS NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT IS IN CONSTRUCTION. RIGHT IN CONSTRUCTION WE HAVE. HERE'S THE BASIC ENTRY WAY WHAT WE WILL BE DONE WITH UP FOR EXAMPLE IS PRE APPRENTICESHIP. WE DEVELOPED A PRE APPRENTICESHIP CURRICULUM AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ALL THE- INTERNATIONAL UNIONS GOT TOGETHER AND SAID THIS IS WHAT WOULD. PREPARE A STUDENT. TO ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT CONSTRUCTION GET THE REMEDIAL HELP THEM GET THEIR GED IF THEY'RE NOT HAVING THEIR DIPLOMA. GET THEM PREPARED WITH A BASIC LEVEL MASS IN THE SOFT SKILLS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO. HAVE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY APPLY FOR. AND GET AN APPRENTICESHIP. AND THAT'S CALLED THE MULTI CROP CORE CURRICULUM. AND SO A STUDENT GOES TO THIS PROGRAM. AND THEY LEARN ALL THE ASPECTS OF ALL THE TRAITS. RIGHT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. SO THAT WHEN THEY- ACTUALLY GET THE CERTIFICATE AFTER SIX MONTHS OR PROGRAM. AND THE I EVEN DO EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL SORT OF ACTIVITIES TO GET THEMSELVES KIND OF. MINE BECAUSE IT'S A VERY PHYSICAL JOB AS WELL. AND SO WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM THIS PROGRAM. THE THAN CAN LOOK AT WHERE THE NEED IS. SO IF THERE'S US OVER SATURATION OF THE LABORERS OR THERE'S OVERSATURATION OF IRON WORKERS AND THEY'RE NOT ACCEPTING. THEY CAN LOOK AT ELECTRICIAN'S PROGRAMS SHEET METAL PROGRAMS PLUMBERS AND PIPEFITTERS. GLAZERS PRIDE PAINTERS WHATEVER THEY THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE AN INTEREST AND- AND THEY STILL HAVE THAT SHOT. IF THERE IS A WAY. TO SORT OF HAVE A BASE. TYPE OF ACCESS. WORDS NOT PROPRIETARY THIS NURSE NO SORT OF LICENSING ISSUES OR- YOU KNOW. INFRINGEMENT ON SOME COPYRIGHT I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY COULD BE SOME BASE WHERE A LOT OF COMPANIES CAN GET TOGETHER. AND SAY WE CAN PROVIDE THIS AS AN APPRENTICESHIP WERE PREPARATION. AND THEN ONCE YOU GET THEM INTO YOUR ACTUAL COMPANY. THE. AND YOU CAN BECOME A FULL FLEDGED. THAT YOU CAN. SHARE WITH ANYBODY ELSE. IT WOULD NOT BE. OUR MODEL. IT'S MULTI EMPLOYER. AND WE GO WE FINISH THE JOB AND WE GO TO THE NEXT CONTRACTOR AND SO ON IN THE NEXT PROJECT. BUT IT COULD BE VERY WELL THAT THEY GET HIRED AS AN APPRENTIC AND THEN THEY STAY WITH THAT COMPANY AS A AS A SINGLE EMPLOYER WHILE I UNDERSTAND. THE PROBLEM IS NOT ONE OF CONFIDENTIALITY I MEAN TO BE FINE FOR A FURNACE TO WORK FOR MULTIPLE EMPLOYERS. IT'S JUST THAT YOU NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT THAT WHEN YOU PRESS RIGHTS THE LINE OF CODE. THAT ACTUALLY MAKES IT INTO A FINISHED PRODUCT. THAT THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP IS THERE TO BE ABLE TO WARRANT TO THE CUSTOMER. THAT THEY OWN THE PRODUCT THAT WAS CREATED SO IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS NEED TO SIT DOWN. AND MAYBE HASH THIS OUT TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING A LEGAL A SAFE HAVEN THE NEEDS TO BE CREATED OR- OR SOMETHING BECAUSE- I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT THE- APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND INTERNSHIPS ARE GOOD THING. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. CARE BE BACK ON THAT I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WE- LOOK AT. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND ON THE JOB TRAINING AS BEING SYNONYMOUS AND- A BRIDGE A PROGRAM IS JUST ONE. OPTION OF AN ON THE JOB TRAINING PROGRAM SO. PERHAPS THE WAY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE UNIQUE MRS THAT MAKE OTHER INDUSTRIES DIFFERENT THAN WHAT. CONSTRUCTION TRADES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BILL SUCCESSFULLY. IS TO LOOK AT OTHER ON THE JOB TRAINING MODELS. THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. BUT BE ABLE TO CREATE SOMETHING. THAT CREATES THE SAME BENEFITS AS AN APPRENTICESHIP MODEL BUT ISN'T. TRYING TO STICK THAT ROUND PEG INTO THAT SQUARE HOLE. TO BE ABLE TO MEET SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES. YEAH AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN MY STUDIO WE DON'T HAVE INTERNSHIPS ANYMORE- WE HAVE. A PROVISIONL EMPLOYEES. RIGHT AND SO WE ARE YOU KNOW BUT BUT WE HAVE FEWER OF THEM THAN WE USED TO HAVE OF INTERNS. SO IT'S HARDER TO GET THAT. LEG UP YOU KNOW THAT FIRST STEP. WHICH IS WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE- YOU KNOW YOU REALLY YOU THINK ABOUT THE PERSON. YOU KNOW. MAYBE FROM A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY MAYBE FROM AN UNDERREPRESENTED. ETHNICITY THAT YOU KNOW JUST NEEDS THAT SHOT. YEP ANYWAY THANK YOU. SO THE SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT. ISSUE WHICH IS OUR GOAL- OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. ON THIS I MEAN I THINK ESPECIALLY THE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL WHILE. IT WILL BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT IS IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN LEARN- FROM YOU'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. STATE WIDE AND DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. YOU KNOW REPRESENTATION FROM. OF LOTS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WE TALK ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THE NEED FOR THAT- INCREASING- ACCESS AND EQUITY. AND SO THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS MODEL AND I THINK EVERYONE. IN THIS ROOM. ARE THESE ARE THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT NEED TO DISCUSS IT SO. I THINK WE CAN- IN THE FUTURE MOVE FORWARD- JUST FOCUSED ON THAT AND HOW THAT CAN BE A SUCCESSFUL MODEL- YOU KNOW ONE THING I THINK ABOUT. THE WITH WITH MR DIMITRI THE OTHER SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT ARE THE CLOSEST TO THESE TECH HUBS THAT SEEM TO GET A LOT OF THE RESOURCE SAYS FROM OUR- CORPORATE CORPORATIONS- BUT- YOU KNOW IN PETERS SCIENCE LIKE. REALLY MENTIONED IS EVERY IN A LT OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES- SO WHAT CAN WE DO- TO YOU KNOW REACH- COMMUNITIES ARE NOT CLOSE TO THESE TACK HOBBS- OR IS THE INDUSTRY WORKING ON THAT. YEAH AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER IT SO. YES I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY ENGAGED AND I THINK THROUGHOUT THE STATE THINKING ABOUT COMMUNITIES LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH MAY BE DON'T NECESSARILY GET THE KIND OF ATTENTION THAT- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEARBY AREAS DOES GET. SO I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'VE BEEN REALLY PROACTIVE WITH IN THE CS FOR CA COLLECTIONS BECAUSE WE SEE ONE WAY IS TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE PRE EXISTING SCHOOLS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO GIVE THEM THE TEACHERS THE SKILL SETS THAT ARE NEEDED TO ACTUALLY. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT HI REGULAR OF COURSE WORK THAT IS NEEDED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WHICH IS SOMETHING THE RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE. WE'RE NOT SEEN AND SO THOS CLASS THE SCHOOLS AND LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AREN'T GETTING. THE KIND OF EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED IN THE STUDENTS ARE ARE. KIND OF. THREE THERE AT THE GAP AND OF THAT AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS BE ABLE TO HELP MITIGATE THAT DO PROVIDING BETTER TEACHER PREPARATION- AND MORE COURSEWORK AVAILABLE IN THOSE AREAS AND THEN FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AND DOUBTS THAT OUR COMPANIES ARE VERY ENGAGE WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND NOT JUST IN THE SO CALLED pBUT IF THERE'S WAYS THAT YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PARTNER IN THOSE COMMUNITIES MORE AND MORE AND BUILD IN THOSE- FOOT PRINTS NO WE'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M SO I WANT TO. MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL. PANEL AND THANK. ALL OF YOU ON THIS PANEL FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS- SO WE WILL SEE OUR FIRST SPEAKER- WILL BE- MARIA CLUB MAY FROM. DOCTOR MARIA CLOUT CLOUT OF A- PRESIDENT OF HARVEY MUDD COLLEGE- IN FOLLOWED BY ALEXIS KERRIGAN FROM CO .ORG SO HAVE THEM SET UP. UP HERE TO BE READY TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY. SO. LET'S SEE I THINK YOU COULD SIT IN THE MIDDLE. YEAH SO WILL START- WITH DOCTOR MARIA CALL THEY PRESIDENT HARVEY MUDD COLLEGE- SHE'S A LEGEND IN THIS FIELD- AS SOME OF YOU KNOW I HAVE FOLLOWED HER FOR YEARS- AND HER WORK AND INCREASING DIVERSITY AT HARVEY MUDD COLLEGE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- I RECENTLY VISITED. HARVEY MUDD COLLEGE AND MET HER AND ASKED HER MONTHS AGO TO BE ON THIS PANEL SO I WANT TO THANK HER FOR JOINING US TODAY SO HANDED OVER TO HER. SO FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN CALIFORNIA DONE IT NATIONALLY BUT IT'S JUST. IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE SO I HAVE A FEW TAKE AWAYS THE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY LOT OF- INSTITUTIONS. TO ORGANIZATIONS TO GET MORE ACCESS TO COMPUTER% SCIENCE IN CASE WHO TWELVE. BUT FOR MY PURSE. OR AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOING THAT AS WELL THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS. IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO START IT FIRST YEAR UNIVERSITY. AND IN PARTICULAR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ENDED UP MAJORING UP OVER THE TIME I'VE BEEN OF MUD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WERE FEMALE OR A PERSON OF COLOR DID NOT HAVE ANY COMPUTER SCIENCE BEFORE THEY GOT THERE. AND IN FACT- I WAS VERY LUCKY SO. WHEN I ARRIVED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT AT MUD HAD STARTED HAD NOTICED THEY HAD A BRAND NEW SYSTEM PROFESSOR WHO JUST FINISHED HER PHD AT MIT. CHRISTINE OF RADO AND SHE HAD NOTICED THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN MAJOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AT MUD WAS ABYSMAL IT WAS ABOUT BETWEEN TWO OR THREE STUDENTS PER YEAR. AND THERE WERE OTHER PLACES- THAT HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING MORE WOMEN TO COMPUTER SCIENCE- THE FIRST TO DO SO WE'RE CARNEGIE MELLON. AND THE U. S. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA AND CANADA WHICH IS WHERE I WAS AT THE TIME AND I STARTED THAT. IN SO THE DEPARTMENT DECIDED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY COULD CHANGE THINGS SO THAT THEY COULD RAISE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN MAJOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE MUD. NO WITHIN FOUR YEARS WE WERE UP 240% WHAT DID THEY CHANGE THE FIRST THING THE CHANGE WAS HOW THE TOP CAUGHT THE INTRODUCTORY COURSE SO J. THE INTRODUCTORY COURSE I'M ASSEMBLYMAN OBERNOLTE SORRY J. THE WAY THEY TAUGHT THE INTRODUCTORY COURSE. BEFORE SO EVERYONE WAS REQUIRED TO TAKE IT AND IT IN THE FIRST SEMESTER. SO AS YOU WERE SAYING AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST DESPISED COURSES EXCEPT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMING SINCE THEY WERE SIX OR TWELVE OR WHATEVER WHO ARE MOSTLY GEEKY GUYS I JUST WANNA MAKE IT REALLY. VERY CLEAR I WOULDN'T MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. I'M A GEEKY PERSON MYSELF I'M MARRIED TO A GEEKY GUY AND MY SON IS A GEEKY GUY LIKE ONE TIME. WHEN I JUST MY FIRST VISIT TO MUD AFTER IS ANNOUNCED WE PRESIDENT MY DAUGHTER CAME WITH ME AND EFFORT SHE SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS A REALLY NICE VERY DORKY BUT NICE NICE. DORKY SHE SAID MONTH YOUR DORK YOU'RE MARRIED TO A DORK AND YOUR OLDEST CHILD IS A DORK HOW WOULD YOU KNOW. SO ANY HELP JUST TO MAKE THAT CLEAR SO THE CHANGE THE INTERCOURSE. AND WITHIN THE VERY FIRST SEMESTER THAT IT WAS TAUGHT. IT BECAME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR COURSES WITH IN MUD AND WITHIN FIVE YEARS IT BECAME PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR COURSE AT THE COMMON COLLEGES. SO I JUST WANNA TELL YOU I GOT THE STATISTICS YESTERDAY. SO RIGHT NOW- WE GRADUATE ABOUT SEVENTY COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS PER YEAR. UP ROUGHLY HALF ARE FEMALE THOSE ARE MUD STUDENTS WE ALSO GRADUATE PROBABLY FORTY TO FIFTY. YOUR SCIENCE MAJORS WHO ARE FROM THE OTHER CLAREMONT COLLEGES SOME TO GIVE YOU SOME STATISTICS OVER JUNIORS AND SENIORS MAJORING COMPUTER SCIENCE TODAY 45% OR FEMALE. FROM THE STUDENTS WERE MAJOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WITH OTHER COLLEGES 51% FEMALE. IF I LOOK AT RACE BECAUSE RACE IS AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF UNDER REPRESENTATION MAYBE MORE SO THAN GENDER FROM THE STUDENTS WERE MAJORING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE IT'S FOUR POINT 2% AFRICAN AMERICAN SEVENTEEN POINT 7% HISPANIC. THE ZERO POINT 3% NATIVE. HAWAIIAN OR OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER. STE TWELVE POINT 5% TWO OR MORE RACES. THE QUITE IS TOGETHER BLACK AND HISPANIC IT'S MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF ASIANS ARE ALMOST THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF WHITE STUDENTS AND IF I ADD IN THE OFF CAMPUS MAJORS THE ONES WHO ARE AT THE OTHER CLAREMONT COLLEGES. IT'S ROUGHLY THE SAME NOT QUITE AS STRONG. SO THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY IS YOU CAN TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE IN A WAY. THAT IS HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE MOTIVATING. TO PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER WHO HATED COMPUTERS UNTIL THEY GOT TO COLLEGE OKAY THIS. BECAUSE NOT EVERY UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COMPUTER SCIENCE IN A WAY IN THAT INCLUSIVE WAY. THE SECOND THING I WANT TO SAY WHICH I THINK WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST PANEL IS THAT IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO GIVE WOMEN AND OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEIR KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT REALLY MOTIVATES THEM THAT'S A SPARK WHICH IS REALLY WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. AND SO WHAT WE DO IT MIND IS WE EITHER PROVIDE IN THE SUMMER AFTER THEIR FIRST YEAR WE TRY TO GET THEM EITHER INTO RESEARCH EXPERIENCE ON WORKING SO ON SOME SOCIETALLY RELEVANT THING USING COMPUTER SCIENCE OR WE HAVE WORKED WITH ALL OF THE TOP TECH COMPANIES TO START EARLY INTERNSHIP PROGRAM SO GOOGLE MICROSOFT FACEBOOK. AMAZON APPLE THEY ALL HAVE EARLY INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS NOW WHERE THEY WILL TAKE STUDENTS AS EARLY AS AFTER THE FIRST YEAR. AND GIVE THEM THAT EXPERIENCE. AND SO WHAT WE KNOW IS FROM RESEARCH IS THAT IF YOU CAN GET. WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHITE WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED CAN BE USED TO SOLVE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS. THEY STAY IN THE GRADUATE. AND THEN THE FINAL THING IS THE MAIN OUR MAJOR CHALLENGES FINDING ENOUGH COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTRUCTORS AND TRAINING THEM TO TEACH INCLUSIVELY. SO I'LL JUST MENTION WE'RE STARTING A NEW PROGRAM THAT MUCH THIS YEAR CALLED THE POSTAL CAN INTRODUCE PLEA COMPUTATION. WHICH IS TO HELP BRING PEOPLE FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES WHO DONE IT PHD THAT USES COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES LEARN HOW TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE A DATA SCIENCE INCLUSIVELY. WE'VE ALSO WORKED WITH SEVERAL OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO HELP THEM ATTRACT MORE WOMEN AND- FULL OF COLOR TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND I JUST WANTED VERY QUICKLY CLOSE BY SAYING- IF YOU DON'T KNOW ALREADY ABOUT WHAT SUCH HERE NO RYAN AND HAS DONE AT CS U. CSU MONTEREY BAY AND HEART NO COLLEGE YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND WE HAVE SOME MATERIALS FOR YOU ABOUT THEIR PROGRAM. THEY'VE WORKED WITH THE COHORT OF STUDENTS FROM SALINAS SO VIRTUALLY ALL STUDENTS OF COLOR- SOMETHING LIKE 37% FEMALE- PARENTS HAVE NEVER GONE TO COLLEGE AND- HAD A GRADUATION OF SOMETHING CRAZY LIKE ALMOST 80% AFTER FOUR YEARS WHICH IS UNHEARD OF FOR CSU AND- COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO. THE ONLY MESSAGE I WANT TO LEAVE WITH YOU. IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S NOT EVEN THAT HARD TO DO. BUT IT DOES REQUIRE SOME RESOURCES SO I'M NOT ASKING FOR RESOURCES FOR HARVEY MUDD BUT THE CSU SYSTEM AND THE- NEW CALL SYSTEM REALLY NEED RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE DEMAND THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SHE REMINDED ME OF MY INTRODUCTORY CS COURSE AT MIT AND HOW IT WASN'T INCLUSIVE AND HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS IT IT WAS CONSIDERED A WEED OUT COURSE- FOR US- AND- SOME OF US MADE IT- BUT I NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T. I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE TOWARDS MAKING ALL INTRODUCTORY COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES INCLUDE INCLUSIVE SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT THOSE POINTS SO NEXT WE HAVE. ALEXIS HARRIGAN I'M DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR CO DOT ORG WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR WOMAN AND I AM SO HONORED TO BE ON A PANEL DR- CHLOE WHO IS SUCH AN ESTEEMED LEADER- OF COMPUTER SCIENCE I IN THE COME IN THIS COMMUNITY NATIONALLY I ADD TEXT. OUR TEAM OUR TEAM UP FLUID IN OUR RICHARD SEATTLE AT THE NO SITTING ON THIS PANEL- WITH HER AND SO WE MIGHT HAVE A STAND UP TUNING IN FROM SEATTLE JUST TO HEAR YOU. AND I ACTUALLY ALSO DID TEACH I DID TAKE AN INTRODUCTORY TO COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE AND I WAS ONE OF THE STUDENTS WHO WAS WE DID OUT IT WAS TERRIBLE IT WAS NOT INCLUSIVE IT WAS NOT- THERE WASN'T CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE- CURRICULUM AND- WE CREATED A VIDEO GAME IN A FOR A AND KICK THE BALL IT WAS. BUT IT WAS NOT GREAT AWESOME SO PROUD TO WORK FOR CO .ORG A NATIONAL NONPROFIT FOCUSED ON EXPANDING ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION. TO UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WE DEFINED AS FEMALE STUDENTS- BLACK LATINA AND NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS MY NAME'S ALEXIS MIRACLE HERE AGAIN AND I AS I MENTIONED THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. I'M GOING TO SKIP OVER SOME OF THE TALKING POINTS I NORMALLY GET BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPOKEN ON THE PREVIOUS PANELS HAVE SHARE THAT INFORMATION- THE ONE PIECE THAT I DID NOT HEAR AT THE MENTION THOUGH IS. THAT THE SALARIES AND THE OPPORTUNITY I WITH THE OPEN JOBS THAT EXIST SO IN CALIFORNIA- THE AVERAGE COMPUTING OCCUPATION HAS AN AVERAGE SALARY OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND. DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH WOULD EXIST OPEN JOBS ALONE. COMES OUT TO A SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION WITH A B. OPPORTUNITY IN TERMS OF ANNUAL SALARIES IN THE STATE- WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT FROM INDUSTRY FROM EDUCATION WITH K. TWELVE AND HIGHER IF I WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- THE PARENT AND STUDENT EXPERIENCE. TO CO .ORG IS AN INTERNATIONAL A NONPROFIT. FORTY IN THE WEST THE PERCENT OF WHAT YOU ARE. AND HAVE COUNSEL CODE BOARD. I WOULD START LOOKING. AT DATA AND PARENTS IN AN ADMITTED. SEVENTY PER. OF PRINCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC SCHOOL SUPPOSED ACTUALLY ABOUT. ONE IS OFFERED IN THE- AKA. UNFORTUNATELY THE- ISSUE IS FUN ANACT FOR. AND BEING ABLE TO TEACHERS TO TEACH SCIENCE. WHEN WE ZOOM OUT NATIONALLY 93% OF PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT ONLY 45% OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS NATIONALLY TEACHER. YOU HEARD THE START EARLIER 39% I HERE IN CALIFORNIA. 50% OF AMERICANS ACCORDING TO GOOGLE GALLUP SURVEY- RING COMPUTER SCIENCE IS ONE OF THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECTS TO STUDY AFTER READING AND WRITING. 75% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE COMPUTER SCIENCE IS COOL IN A WAY THAT IT WASN'T TEN YEARS AGO. AT 67% OF PARENTS AND 56% OF TEACHERS BELIEVE COMPUTER SCIENCE SHOULD BE REQUIRED. TO LEARN- SHOULD BE REQUIRED AS A COURSE A COMPUTER SAID SHOULD BE REQUIRED EXCUSE ME. AND ASKED DIDN'T TO LEARN COMPUTER SCIENCE IN HIGH SCHOOL- ARE SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO MAJOR IN IT AND FOR FEMALE STUDENTS- THEY ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO MAJOR IF THEY ARE OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE IN HIGH SCHOOL. I SUIT GOING BACK TO THE WORK THAT WE DO HERE- IN CALIFORNIA. I WE HAVE AN AMAZING PARTNERSHIP WITH EIGHT DIFFERENT- PUBLIC OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES OR I NON PROFITS IN THE STATE. TO OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE TRAINING TO THOSE TEACHERS. IN ORDER TO EXPAND ACCESS TO. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WERE WHO WERE RECEIVING COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE- CO DOT ORG HIS AT THEIR SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND TEACHERS WHO HAVE ACCOUNTS AND CO DOT ORG. IN TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION STUDENTS HAVE ACCOUNTS ON CÂ¡ CURRICULUM IN THE LAST SCHOOL YEAR 62% ATTENDED HIGH NEED SCHOOLS 7% ARE IN RURAL SCHOOLS. ARE 5043% ARE FEMALE STUDENTS FIFTY NINE- HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS AGAIN WE DEFINE THOSE AS- BLOCK- LATINO OR AT NATIVE AMERICAN AYE OR HAWAIIAN. WITH THE OUR COULD OR PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE FIFTY NINE FACILITATORS WORKING ACROSS THE STATE- AND OUR PARTNERS RANGER ARE FROM COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. UNIVERSITIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE I KNOW WE HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT OF SPEAKERS THERE'S NOT A LOT MORE I WOULD LIKE TO ADD APART FROM. IN ORDER TO INCREASE EQUITABLE ACCESS EXPAND OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR MOST UNDERSERVED STUDENTS IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES ARE STARTING IN THE K. TWELVE SECTOR IN SUPPORTING TEACHERS BOTH IN SERVICE AND PRE SERVICE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO WE HAVE TWO MORE SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP- FOR Q. NA FOR THE FULL PANEL- WE HAVE ELLIE GARDNER FROM PROJECT LEAD THE WAY. AND P. EVENT METER A TEACHER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. SO WE WILL START- WITH ELLIE GARDNER AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW PROJECT LEAD THE WAY HAS BEEN A LEADER IN GETTING. COMPUTER SCIENCE AND STEM EDUCATION CURRICULUM INTO OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS- SO WILL ALL START WITH ELLIE WELCOME THE THING JAIL AND AS YOU MENTIONED PROJECT LEAD THE WAY IS AB CURRICULUM AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROVIDER IN THIS TIME SPACE. MY NAME IS ALLEY GARNER AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR PROJECT LEAD THE WAY I'M ACTUALLY TAKE A STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD ABOUT SPARKING INTEREST IN STUDENTS AND RETAINING STUDENTS IN THE COMPUTER SCIENCE SPACE. WHAT WE'VE NOTICED AS WHEN WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH THE LACK OF GIRLS THE LACK OF DATA THAT WE HAVE FOUR. GIRLS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN COMPUTR SCIENCE THERE IS OFTEN A KNEE JERK REACTION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH SCHOOL. WHILE THOSE ARE VERY BENEFICIAL IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. NEW HIGH SCHOOL COURSES ALONE WILL NOT CLOSE THE GAP FOR GIRLS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. STUDENTS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY ARE GOOD AT MATH OR SCIENCE AT A VERY EARLY AGE. THINK ABOUT THE FIRST TIME YOU THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GOOD AT SOMETHING. I KNOW IT WAS EARLY FOR ME. RESEARCH ON STUDENT AT SELF EFFICACY IN MATH AND SCIENCE THAT SHOW WAS STARTING STARTLING REALITY. GIRLS AND BOYS BEGIN SELF SELECTING OUT OF THESE SUBJECTS AS EARLY AS SECOND GRADE. IF STUDENTS ENCOUNTER COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL. THEY OFTEN SELF SELECT OUT THEY DECIDE IT ISN'T FOR THEM WITHOUT EVEN TRYING IT. WE MUST ENGAGE STUDENTS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. ACTUALLY WE SHOULD ENGAGE THEM IN PRE K. IMAGINE IF WE SUGGESTED THE KIDS DON'T START PLAYING BASKETBALL OR BASEBALL OR SOFTBALL UNTIL NIGHT GREAT. OR PERHAPS IN MUSIC WE WAITED UNTIL NINTH GRADE TO HAND OUT TRUMPETS OR SAXOPHONES ARE FLEETS AND THEN ATTEMPTED TO BE A MARCHING BANDS. WE KNOW THAT SUCCESS IN ATHLETICS AND MUSIC BEGINS EARLY ON SO WHY WHY ARE WE FORCING STUDENTS. TO WAIT SEE COMPUTER SCIENCE UNTIL SO LATE TO THEIR EDUCATION. TO THAT END- WE UTILIZE AND SUGGEST FOCUSING UPON THREE RESEARCH BASED FINDINGS TO FUEL AND SUSTAIN EQUITY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE FIRST COMPUTER SCIENCE TO BE INTEGRATED AS PART OF THE NORMAL CLASSROOM CURRICULUM AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. SECONDLY COMPUTER SCIENCE SHOULD BE TAUGHT AS EARLY AS PRE K. USING DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PRACTICES AND FINALLY COMPUTER SCIENCE TO BE TAUGHT AS PART OF A BROADER EXPOSURE TO CAREERS AND OPPORTUNITIES BEGINNING IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. FIRST AND FOREMOST COMPUTER SCIENCE SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART IS THE PART OF THE OVERALL ELEMENTARY CURRICULUM AND THE REGULAR CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE. COMPUTER SCIENCE TO NOT BE A SINGLE ACTIVITY DONE ONCE A YEAR. COMPUTER SCIENCE SHOULD BE AN EXPECTED PART OF THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE EARLY ON BECAUSE IT NORMALIZES COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR ALL PREVENTING THAT NEGATIVE SELF SELECTION THAT OFTEN IMPACTS GIRLS AND STUDENTS THE COLORS. IN THEIR PURSUIT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND STEM. INTEGRATED AN ONGOING CLASSROOM EXPERIENCES ALSO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS NOT JUST THOSE WITH ACCESS TO COMPUTERS AT HOME EXPERIENCE COMPUTER SCIENCE. EARLY EXPOSURE TO COMPUTER SCIENCE USING DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PRACTICE IS KEY TO CREATING SUSTAINING INTEREST IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS THAT LEARNING STEM CONTENT DURING PRESCHOOL YEARS IS CRITICAL TO LATER SUCCESS IN SCHOOLS FOR ALL DOMAINS. INCLUDING READING COMPREHENSION AND MATHEMATICS FOR PRESCHOOLERS THAT MEANS ENGAGING IN LEARNING AND WHAT FEELS LIKE PLAY- I BROUGHT TODAY THE CODING MOUSE THAT IS VERY POPULAR IN THE PRESCHOOL AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SPACE. BECAUSE. IT'S IMPORTANCE USING THIS CODING MOUSE USING THIS CUTTING MOUSE STUDENTS DEVELOP SPATIAL SENSE BY EXPLORING THE DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT OF THE MOUSE THE IDEAS OF OVER UNDER THROUGH AND AROUND THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND COMPUTER SCIENCE ENCODING EARLY ON AND SEEING PLAY AS PART OF LESSON PLANNING WHILE ALSO DEVELOPING SKILLS LIKE PROBLEM SOLVING CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION. FINALLY COMPUTER SCIENCE SHOULD BE TAUGHT SIMPLY AS A SUBJECT BUT RATHER AS PART OF A CAREER EXPLORATION EARLY ON. MOST OF US WHEN ASKED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROBABLY SAID SOMETHING LIKE TEACHER DOCTOR OR POLICEMEN WHILE THAT LIST OFTEN DOES EXPANDS AWARENESS OF CAREERS IN THE SKILLED NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. JOCELYN MACULA OF JEFFERSON ELEMENTARY IN COMPTON WAS NAMED THAN- THE KILTIE W. NATIONAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER OF THE YEAR AND TWENTY NINETEEN. IN HER NOMINATION PAPER A FIFTH GRADE TEACHER A FIFTH GRADE GIRL WROTE OF MISS MACULA I NEVER HAD ANY COMPUTER SCIENCE EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE THE MISS MACULA I FEEL I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AN ENGINEER. I AM LEARNING THAT I AM ABLE TO BE AN ENGINEER EVEN THOUGH I'M FROM COST. AS THIS EXAMPLE SHOWS AWARENESS OF THE SUBJECT AREA IS NOT ENOUGH THIS STUDENT CLEARLY HAD HEARD ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE SHE HAD HEARD ABOUT ENGINEERING. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT STUDENTS MUST BE EXPOSED TO AND EXPERIENCE COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR THEMSELVES EARLY ON. WITHOUT EXPOSURE AND EXPERIENCE MANY STUDENTS ASSUME THEY CAN'T PURSUE THAT SUBJECT. AND OUR CAREER. THE SAYING IS YOU CAN'T BE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE. IT APPLIES HERE. STUDENTS NEED TO EXPERIENCE COMPUTER SCIENCE IN THE ON A REGULAR CLASSROOM SETTING EARLY ON. THEY NEED TO EXPERIENCE COMPUTER SCIENCE HANDS ON AND THEY NEED TO SEE WHAT A COMPUTER SCIENTIST IS AND WHAT A COMPUTER SCIENTIST DOES. WE DON'T WANT STUDENTS TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE A GIRL BECAUSE THEY ARE STUDENT COLOR OR THEIR FROM A CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THEY CAN'T FLOURISH AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WITH. THIS WHOLE THEY THIS WHOLE HEARING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS AND WHAT TEACHERS SHOULD TEACH IN. A WHAT GRADE LEVEL- AND SO I'M EXCITED TO HEAR FROM A TEACHER- AND WE HAVE P. EVENT METER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER- SHE'S BEEN TEACHING SCIENCE FOR OVER THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF BEING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER COORDINATOR- AND SCIENCE DEPARTMENT CHAIR AT MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IN RIVERSIDE. WELCOME PIA THANK YOU. ON BEHALF OF THE THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR- CONVENING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING AND INVITING ME TO PROVIDE AN- EDUCATOR'S PERSPECTIVE. IN NAM ENSURING ACCESS AND EQUITY TO STEM COURSES. INCLUDING COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR STUDENTS IN AT TO SUCCEED IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AS CHAIR OF THE CURRICULUM INSTRUCTIONS COMMITTEE AT C. CASE POLICY MAKING BODY THE STATE COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. WE HAVE LONG STANDING ORGAN ORGANIZATIONAL POLICY EMPHASIZING CTA SUPPORT FOR STRONG STEM PROGRAMS. THIS MORNING I WILL TALK ABOUT ACCESS TO STAND FOR ALL STUDENTS PARTICULAR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. AND WASTE A STEM EDUCATION COULD BE IMPROVED. CDA BELIEVES ALL STUDENTS SHALL HAVE ACCESS TO A STANDARD BATES COLLEGE AND CAREER CURRICULUM TO PREPARE SOME FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND LEADS THEM TO MEANINGFUL. AND INFORM CORRECT CHOICES. THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY DEPENDS ON TODAY STUDENTS BE TOMORROW'S INNOVATORS. FOR THIS REASON CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS NEED SYSTEMIC ONGOING ACCESS TO STEM. ACROSS THE CURRICULUM IN GRADES T. K. TWELVE. STEM IS NOT CONSISTENTLY IMPLEMENTED AND THERE'S NO COHERENCY FROM DISTRICT TO DISTRICT OR SCHOOL TO SCHOOL WITHIN THE DISTRICT. FOR EXAMPLE MOST DISTRICTS STARTER STEM PROGRAMS AND MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL DEPENDING ON THEIR GRANTS OR A ACADEMIES. MOST OFTEN IN PROGRAMS ARE NOT IN SO IN SAID AND- IN SOME. DISTRICTS HAVE USED THE STEM EDUCATION PLATFORM TO LURE STUDENTS BACK FROM- CHARTER SCHOOLS. IF STEM EDUCATION IS A FOCUS OF THE DISTRICT MOST ACTIVITIES ARE AFTER SCHOOL RATHER THAN WOVEN INTO THE REGULAR SCHOOL DAY. EVEN THOUGH COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS IN MATH AND NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS LEND THEMSELVES TO TEACHING STEM DISTRICT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS IS NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM THE EXPERTISE. TO INCORPORATE SALMON THEIR CURRICULUM MANY ELEMENTARY TEACHERS WANT TO TEACH SAN BASED IN KOREA LEARNING BUT OUR PUSH TO EMPHASIZE ENGLISH AND MATH SPECIFIC TO THE DISTRICT ADOPTED CURRICULUM. TEACHERS ARE CONCERNED WOULDN'T EVEN EVEN ACCESS SYSTEM FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND SPECIAL ED STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE A MY HIGH SCHOOL SPECIAL ED AS WELL AS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ARE PREVENTED FROM TAKING SPECIFIC STEM CURRICULUM. BECAUSE THEY NEED TO TAKE MANDATORY CLASSES. MANY DISTRICTS HAVE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE THAT PREVENT THE STUDENTS FROM ACCESSING STEMMED CLASSES. OTHER ISSUES HAVE TO DO WITH THE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION FOR STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO ATTEND THE STEM SCHOOLS IN WHICH INFILL TRIPS I DEPENDED ON AVAILABILITY OF BUSES DURING THE DAY OR NO FUNDING FOR ANY. TYPE OF ENRICHMENT TO HAVE A MODEL STEM EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS WE NEED TO BEGIN WITH HOW WE EDUCATE OUR NEW TEACHERS COMING INTO THE PROFESSION. THEY NEED TO HAVE A FOUNDATION FOR UNDERSTANDING OF CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD FOSTER STEM EDUCATION IN OUR CLASSROOMS. THERE SHOULD BE WASTE FOR STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT STEM FIELDS BY MEANT. SHALL SHADOWING FIELD TRIPS A PRINTER AN INTERNSHIP OP. THERE SHOULD BE A PARTNER BETWEEN DISTRICTS. AND BUSINESSES TO FOSTER STUDENT INTEREST IN THE STEM FIELDS. STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS STEM CORRECT TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION AND COMPUTER BECAUSE- IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR A FOUR YEAR DEGREE WITH A CAREER PIPELINE FOR GRADUATING STUDENTS IN THE STEM INDUSTRY. THE MODEL WE HAVE NOW IS NOT ENOUGH TO SERVICE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OUR STUDENTS EXPERIENCE A QUALITY STEM EDUCATION. THERE'S NEED TO BE A SYSTEMIC PARADIGM SHIFT THAT INSTITUTIONALIZED STEM EDUCATION FOR TKA TWELFTH THIS WILL NEED TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF ED. TO DISTRICTS ENSURING ALL STUDENTS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS AND MONETARY SUPPORT NO MATTER WHICH PART OF TOWN THEY LIVED IN. STARTING STEM EDUCATION AND SECONDARY GRADES IS TO LET. CHILDREN ARE NATURALLY CURIOUS AND THIS SHOULD BE FOSTERED AT A YOUNG AGE WHICH MEANS STEM EDUCATION SHOULD BE STARTING AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IN CLOSING CTA. RESHAPES THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR- YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THE STEM ISSUES AND IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS A POLICY ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU ACTUALLY WITH A- THAT CALIFORNIA EDUCATOR. FOR THE JANUARY ISSUE ADD THIS INCLUDES SECTIONS OF THE TEACHER INNOVATORS ON PAGES SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY NINE. ABOUT TEACHER SUCCESSFULLY TEACHING STEM COURSES AND INSPIRING STERN ACROSS THE STATE WE NEED MORE THIS EXEMPLARY TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA'S TEACHER WORK FORCE TO ENSURE ALL OF THE STUDENTS HAVE THIS TYPE OF EXPERIENCE IN THEIR CLASSROOM. EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT TEACHERS ON THIS PANEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH SINCE OUR LAST PANEL I REALLY ENJOYED THE- THE KIND OF I FELT LIKE THE BOTH SIDES LIKE IT'S WE NEED TO START EARLY AND IT'S NOT TOO LATE YEAH. I LOVED HEARING AT ALL AT THE SAME TIME RIGHT HAVE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN A STEM EDUCATOR FOR YEARS ALWAYS FOCUSED ON YOUNGER KIDS. I ALSO WORKED AT CAL TECH ACTS- BUT THE KIDS THAT WENT THERE WERE ALREADY INTERESTED AND WE WERE JUST FOCUSING ON MAKING THEM SUCCESSFUL- IN THE FUTURE- SO I REALLY ENJOYED THIS- BUT BEFORE I ASK MY QUESTION I'D LIKETO OPEN IT UP TO. THE COMMITTEE SO MR OBERNOLTE. SO I THOUGHT IT WAS A FAST NAY THIS. OF WHEN THE APPROACH TIME TO START EDUCATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES YOU HEARD ME OUT REALLY THREE DIFFERENT OPINIONS WITH. THIS GARDENER SAYING BEFORE KINDERGARTEN MISSPENT METER SAYING YOU KNOW IN IT- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND DOCTOR KLAUS SAYING IF NOT. I MEAN. IT'S NOT A BAD THING TO START SOON BUT YOU CERTAINLY CAN START LATER AS WELL- BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT. THE DISCONNECT HERE IS. A FAILURE TO FIND DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY THE A WHAT IS COMPUTER SCIENCE WHAT IS CODING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE. A PRE KINDERGARTEN STUDENT AND SAY LET'S TALK ABOUT PYTHON RIGHT- SO WHAT WE'RE TEACHING IS VERY DIFFERENT I THINK IT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CODER. IS VERY DIFFERENT WHEN I LEARNED TO PROGRAM. IT WAS CLEAR THAT CODING MATT TAKING A- PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND WRITING COMPUTER CODE BUT- AS COMPUTER SCIENCE HAS EVOLVED YOU KNOW OBJECT ORIENTATION MEANS THAT REALLY ARE USING CODE THAT OTHER PEOPLE WRITE. SCRIPTING LANGUAGES MEAN THAT REALLY YOU'RE NOT WRITING A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AT ALL AND NOW I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SKILLS THAT WE TEACH TO STUDENTS. EVEN DOING WORK IN AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET OR DOING ADVANCED SEARCH IN GOOGLE I MEAN THAT IS CODING THERE REALLY IS THAT IS PROGRAMMING SO I MEAN I REALLY THINK THAT THE ANSWER TO THIS YOU KNOW THIS. THIS DOESN'T- IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT CODING MEANS A LOT MORE THAN JUST WRITING LINES OF COMPUTER CODE. AND YOU KNOW JUST TEACHING A PRE KINDERGARTEN STUDENT HOW TO USE A COMPUTER TO PERFORM TASKS TO GET INFORMATION YOU KNOW THAT IS. PREPARING THEM FOR A CAREER IN PROGRAMMING. SO IF I MAY EIGHT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- WE INTERCHANGEABLY USE THE WORD CODING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND OFTEN TIMES THAT- ACTUALLY. UP PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE COMPOSED AT CODING IS A PART OF COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT NOT THE ONLY PART AND SO WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THOSE THINGS- BROKEN APART AN- IMPORTANT I. IN ANSWER TO YOUR ABOUT. A STUDENTS LET ME JUST READ WHAT WE WHAT WE UTILIZE A PRE K. C. CAN UNDERSTAND. YOU SAID THAT REALLY COOL NOW BECAUSE IT'S COLORFUL AND I BROUGHT WITH ME SOME. STUDENTS DIFFICULT SPATIAL SENSE WHEN THE ACTIVITIES THAT IT EXPLORE CORRECTIONAL MOVEMENT OVER UNDER THROUGH AROUND BUT THEN AGAIN TO DEVELOP CODING SKILLS AS THEY PLAN UP. WITH CREATE WEARABLE CODE AND CODE AN INTERACTIVE ROBOTIC DEVICE. KATE AMOUNTS. I THINK IN TO PASS CAN CREATE. CODE THAT THE LEAD TO THE LOOK OF A OF A HIDDEN ITEM. AND SO THOSE KIND OF. SPARK EARLY ON SO IT'S A- THE WRITING OF THE CODE THAT YOU'RE TALK ABOUT. BUT EXPLORING HOW. COMPUTER SCIENCE CODE CAN BE A PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE AND WHAT THEY USE THROUGHOUT THE DAY I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT AND USING IT IN. DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE- ACTIVITIES IS KEY TO ENSURING THAT THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. SO I SO FIRST OF ALL I ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO LEARNING. NOT JUST CODING BUT THE BROADER SET OF COMPUTATIONAL THINKING SKILLS. BUT I WANT TO FOCUS RIGHT NOW ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT POPULATION. A I AND DATA SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. AND WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW LONG AFTER THEY GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE WHO WERE GOING NEED TO LEARN THE SKILLS SO WHEN WE THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE ALL SAYING. IS THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO MAKE THIS KNOWLEDGE EXCESS ACCESSIBLE AN INTERESTING AND HIGHLY MOTIVATING FOR PEOPLE OF ANY AGE WITH THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRE K. STUDENT. A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT COLLEGE STUDENT GRADUATE STUDENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MENTIONED THE- POST OP PROGRAM WERE STARTING. I I'M AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY WHO GOT HER PHD AND MATHEMATICS NEVER TOOK A COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE NEVER WROTE A LINE OF CODE. DISCOVERED WITHIN THE YEAR AFTER MY PHD THAT THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR MATHEMATICIANS WHO ALSO COULD DO COMPUTER SCIENCE WERE LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES WHATTHEY WERE FROM ETHNIC MATHEMATICAL PH DIS WEB BACK. STARTED A SECOND PHD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE GOT HIRED BY ONE OF THE TOP TEN DEPARTMENTS IN THE WORLD. LITERALLY NINE MONTHS AFTER I STARTED. OKAY THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO LEARN WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE ALL SAYING IS NUMBER ONE. ALL OF OUR CHILDREN NEED IT. ALL OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS NEED IT. ALL OF OUR ADULTS INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CODING ANYMORE. THEY ARE GOING TO NEED THIS. AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO GET MUCH BETTER AT PROVIDING ACCESS. TO EVERYONE. FOR MORE PLEASE- WE ARE NOT AT CÂ¡ DOT ORG WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CREATE- THE OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS SO THAT THE STUDENTS WILL BE GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL GOING INTO COLLEGE TO BE COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS NOR ARE WE SAYING THAT EVERY STUDENT NEEDS TO BE A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER OR ENGINEER BUT IT WE HAVE SEEN THAT EVERY FIELD I WE HAVE NOT FOUND A SINGLE FIELD WHERE AN UNDERSTANDING OF COMPUTING AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPTS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE LIKE COMPUTATIONAL THINKING. ARE NOT NECESSARY THAT'S NOT TO SAY EVERY SINGLE JOB WILL REQUIRE THAT BUT EVERY FIELD HAS- A COMPONENT THAT REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE IS WHEN OUR FOUNDER STARTED CO DOT ORG HE USED TO SAY IN HIS INITIAL TALKS YOU UNLESS YOU'RE DRIVING TRUCKER FLIPPING BURGERS YOU DON'T NEED YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF COMPUTING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT EVEN NOW IN THE TIME AUTOMATION WE HAVE. AUTOMATED TRUCKS DRIVING EVERY DAY FROM ARIZONA TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- THAT ARE SEMI AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WE HAVE NO IN MANY OF THE LARGEST FAST FOOD INDUSTRY'S COMPUTERIZED BURGER FLIPPERS REPLACING THE JOBS OF THE MOST ENTRY LEVEL JOBS SO WHAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GIVING STUDENTS THE TOOLS WHO MAY NOT BE GOING TO COLLEGE MAY BE PURSUING SERVICE INDUSTRY CAREERS- THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TO USE THAT COMPUTERS WELL LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU SAID IN YOUR COMMENTS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. OF THE HIGH WAGE HIGH WAGES IN THE INFORMATION INDUSTRY AND THE NEED TO- CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE UNDERSERVED UNITIES GET ACCESS TO THOSE WAGES WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL IN. WITH ABOUT YOU KNOW TRISTE. FEET OF INFORMATION TO. IS THE JUST. IN WORKER PRO. BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY REALLY GOOD AT IT AND PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ARE PRETTY GOOD AT IT SO I MEAN TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE I HAVE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS THAT WORK FOR ME. THAT ARE TEN TIMES MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN OTHERS THE WORK FOR ME SO IT CREATES AN INTERESTING DILEMMA BECAUSE- HOW DO YOU. CREATE COMPENSATION EQUITY IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE- I MEAN. SOCIETY WOULDN'T SAY IT'S FAIR TO PAY ONE PERSON TEN TIMES AS MUCH AS ANOTHER. BUT IF THEIR PRODUCTIVITY IS TEN TIMES HIGHER IF YOU DON'T PAY THEM AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TIMES AS MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO GO WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE SO. YOU KNOW I WONDER YOU CREATE THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE EXACERBATING INCOME INEQUALITY WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES HOW DO WE HOW DO WE AS A SOCIETY. GRAPPLE WITH THAT PROBLEM. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE IMPLYING. ARE YOU ARE YOU SAYING THAT PEOPLE FROM UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ARE NOT PERFORMING AS ON OR NOT OKAY. A LITTLE CONFUSED NO I MEAN I MEAN THAT IF YOU TAKE. IF YOU TAKE IN A POPULATION OF PROGRAMMERS IN A PROGRAM IS UNIQUE IF YOU HIRE A COUPLE PEOPLE TO- YOU KNOW BUILD A WIDGET ON ASSEMBLY LINE YOU KNOW ONE MIGHT BE TWO OR THREE TIMES AS MO AT MOST AS PRODUCTIVE AS THE NEXT ONE AND USUALLY. THAT INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES WITH EXPERIENCE- PROGRAMMING IS VERY MUCH NOT THAT WAY THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST. THE JUST BRAINS ARE WIRED TO WORK THAT WAY RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW THEY AND THEY COULD THEY COULD BE TEN TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS THE PERSON NEXT TO THEM- SO I JUST WONDER. HOW DO WE A SOCIETY GRAPPLE WITH THAT PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IT YOU KNOW WHAT. I WANT YOU KNOW SO RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW IS THAT- MOST OF THE TOP SOFTWARE DEVELOPING. ACES ARE USING PAIR PROGRAMMING AND USING IT BECAUSE IT A CREATES LIKE MOST OF THE EFFORT IN A COMPLICATED SOFTWARE SYSTEM GOES INTO DEBUGGING I MEAN. MAYBE LESS TRUE IN THE GAME INDUSTRY BUT DEFINITELY FOR- YOU KNOW LARGE SCALE SYSTEMS AND SO WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO ACHIEVE IT'S NOT THAT YOU CAN WRITE THE CODE FAST BUT YOU CAN WRITE THE CODE AT A REASONABLE SPEED BUT IT HAS MANY FEWER ERRORS. AND SO THERE ARE A BUNCH OF WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THAT PAIR PROGRAMMING DOES MUCH BETTER AND ACTUALLY DOES BETTER WITH PEOPLE WHOSE BRAINS ARE WIRED DIFFERENTLY TOGETHER. AND SO THIS WHOLE IDEA AND YOU KNOW I HAPPEN TO HAVE A SON WHO- IS AN AMAZING SOFTWARE ARCHITECT SOFTWARE ENGINEER IN WHO CAN WRITE REALLY QUICKLY. BUT ONE OF THINGS THAT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO ME IN AND WATCHING HIS CAREER IS THAT. THEY'RE NOW REALLY FOCUSING ON GETTING PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE SKILLS TO COME AND WORK TOGETHER SO ONE OF THINGS WE EMPHASIZE IT MIGHT IS FIRST OF ALL A LOT OF OUR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING BECAUSE THAT'S BEST PRACTICE NOW. BUT ALSO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT IS ON TRAINING. OUR STUDENTS TO WORK IN DIVERSE TEAMS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS ARE PERSPECTIVES AND I'M NOT TALKING NESTLE ABOUT RACE OR GENDER THOUGH THAT'S PART OF IT. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS IS ANOTHER PART OF IT THEY BRING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND THAT CREATES BETTER SOLUTIONS SO YOU KNOW THAT. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE HAVE MAJOR ISSUES ABOUT PAY EQUITY I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING AT MODE RIGHT NOW IS YOUR HAVE TO MAJOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE TO GET PAID A HUNDRED FIFTY K. PER YEAR WHEN YOU GRADUATE. YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE THE FIRST THREE COURSES IN SEQUENCE AND GOOGLE OR MICROSOFT OR- APPLE FOR WHOEVER WILL HIRE YOU. BECAUSE THEY HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO DO JUST FINE THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING POSITION. MEANING THE BY OR MAJOR SINK. PHYSICS AND- ENGINEER AND NOT GO TO GRAD SCHOOL OR NOT GOING INTO OTHER AREAS ANYMORE BECAUSE- THERE'S JUST THIS. VACUUM SUCKING PEOPLE INTO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING THINGS SO THESE ARE LOTS OF PROBLEMS TO SOLVE. I THINK THE REASON I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE TO BE TALKING. TO YOU IS BECAUSE- I DO THINK CALIFORNIA IT NEEDS TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF IT. WE CERTAINLY HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IN OUR SCHOOLS. WE HAVE A LOT OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE IF WE REALLY WANT OUR TECH ECONOMY TO CONTINUE AND RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING'S A TECH HEALTHCARE IS A TECH ECONOMY ENTERTAINMENT TO TECH ECONOMY EVERYTHING IS A TECH CON WE REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE COUNTRY IN DOING THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIX WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES AND IN. OUR ADULT EDUCATION FOR TOTALLY TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT AND YOU KNOW JUST- WILL BE A LOOPING IT BACK TO THE DISCUSSION WE WERE HAVING YOU KNOW IF. IF OUR GOAL YOU KNOW IS TO INCREASE PROSPERITY THEN- I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE AREN'T WE- IDENTIFY THOSE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE I MEAN THE OTHER'S GIGS. THE EXISTENCE OF THESE I MEAN JUST BE CALLED SUPER PROGRAMMERS WRITE THESE THESE PEOPLE WITH VERY HIGH PRODUCTIVITY IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING- THOSE PEOPLE ARE ABOUT I HAVE BEEN UNDER. THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE THE SUPPLY AS AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THEM BUT IT'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING PROBLEM FOR. SOCIETY TO SOLVE YOU KNOW HOW TO HOW TO BALANCE THIS- HAVE COMPENSATION AGAINST PRODUCTIVITY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE ARMS AROUND. LIKE TO GIVE YOU HAVE MISSED WHEN I TALK ABOUT THAT SYSTEMIC AS IN A PARADIGM SHIFT I THINK IT'S WHAT ELLIE WAS TALKING ABOUT. MOST OFTEN NOW WHEN WE GO INTO A CLASSROOM. THERE'S NOT EVEN A SENSE OF PLAY AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN LOWER GRADES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FOCUSED OF WANTING TO. DO CERTAIN THINGS AT THE SAME TIME FOR EVERY SINGLE CLASSROOM. THERE'S NOT TIME FOR THEM TO KIND OF EXPLORE. IN NOT THE PART TO ME LIKE WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL WHICH WAS I GRADUATED IN NINETY THREE IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT- I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT. I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT IN MIDDLE AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DEAR STIS SETS OF ALL. IN WHICH HIGH NEED TO PUT IT IN BASED ON WE KNOW PUTTING IN COMMON CORE- STATE SANDERS WE DID AND GSS BUT WE STILL ARE CONSTRAINED AS TEACHERS TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT INCLUDE HOW TO. IMPART THAT MISSION THAT'S PART OF PLAY. LIKE WHAT'S CONSTRAINT PART OF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS PASSION OR JUST A JOB BECAUSE THAT THERE IS THAT. WHERE HEY I COULD GET HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND GO INTO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS ONE PERSON THAT DAY LEAD LIVE AND BREATHE IT. SOLD WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO IMPART THAT PASSION FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT. BUT WE CAN'T IF WE DON'T GIVE OUR TEACHERS CHANCE TO CHANGE THE WITH THE WITH THE IN THE CLASSROOM. TO IT FUN FOR THIS. IT'S A THAT TO ME I THINK IS THE- THING. THAT WE DO BECAUSE THEY WALK IN THE YOU SAID G LLEGE WAY IT'S A BOOK. IT'S ABOUT THE BOOK IT'S ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE AND I THINK THAT THE PART THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF GRAPPLE WITH I'M WE CAN CHANGE THAT AND- KEY. TWELVE THANK YOU SO OF. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. PETRIE-NORRIS SOMEWHAT PICKING UP ON THAT YES IT WILL YOU YOU BOTH MENTIONED I'M LEON MENTIONED. SOME OF THE REALLY HUGE HUGE AND FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES WERE FACING AND YOUR K. THROUGH TWELVE CLASSROOMS AND- IT KIND OF COMES DOWN TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL IN MANY WAYS. EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS FOR THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION RIGHT RIGHT AND YOU KNOW TO DO THOSE KINDS OF JOBS AND- I'M IN THE PATH FROM WHERE WE ARE. TOO HIGH A CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT THAT ACTUALLY PREPARES OUR STUDENTS IN AN INTEGRATED AT AN INCLUSIVE WAY FOR THE JOB. TOMORROW AND THERE IS I YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT THAT WE NEED TO DO AND YOU YOU MENTIONED MANY OF THOSE THINGS. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IF YOU I'M YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE ABLE TO TELL US ONE THING. ONE THING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE US DO YOU THIS YEAR WHAT WOULD IT BE. I'M STARTING WITH. ME FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN PARTICULAR- THEY SHOULD HAVE A HUB. THAT ALL EITHER- BY GRADE LEVELS BECAUSE WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY ANTED TEACHERS ACTUALLY SAID THIS TO ME. WE'RE DATE THEY COULD GO AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH STEM IS THAT. THEN I'D AS A TEACHER COULD COME IN AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE AND THEN BRING IN STUDENTS SAN AND THEN JUST HAVE THEM EXPLORE. INSTILL IN ESSENCE INCORPORATING READING WRITING. MATHEMATICS BUT NOW IT'S IN PLAY. OUR CLASSROOM DOES NOT LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU SEE IN GOOGLE WHERE IT'S LIKE STILL EITHER ALL CHAIRS DESK YOU KNOW IN LINE SOMETHING WE ARE CHANGING THERE'S ARE THERE ARE TEACHERS THAT HAVE CHANGED THAT WHERE WE HAVE MOVABLE YOU KNOW I'M I GUESS. WE'LL SEE THAT'S CORRECT BUT THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THAT THERE'S NO MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL. SOLD MOST OFTEN TEACHERS WOULD ACTUALLY PAY ON THEIR OWN MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO I. IF I WERE GONNA TRY AND DO ONE THING I WOULD. IMPROVE THE PAY AND THE RESPECT. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TEACHING AT ALL LEVELS. BECAUSE ONE OF THE REALLY BIG PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW IS THAT IF YOU'RE PAID TO BE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER IS SIXTY THOUSAND PER YEAR I DON'T KNOW I'M GUESSING- I KNOW IT'S HIGHER IN SOME PLACES. AND IF YOU'RE PAID TO BE STARTING A SOFTWARE ENGINEER IS A HUNDRED FIFTY K. I MEAN EVEN JUST EIGHT UNIVERSITY LEVELS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS. ONE OF OUR GRADUATES CAN GET A HUNDRED FIFTY K. SOMEBODY WHO GOES AND GETS A PEACH TEA. AND THEN COMES BACK AND TEACHES IS GONNA BE SOMEPLACE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FIVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY K. SO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. SO YOU YOU KNOW. I REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO. WE NEED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO TEACH AND MOTIVATE PEOPLE FOR THEIR THEIR TEACHING ADULT STUDENTS OR TEACHING COULD PRE KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS WE NEED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE CAREERS AND I REALLY THINK RIGHT NOW. WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT THE OUR STATE IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF HOW WE PAY OUR TEACHERS. BUT I YOU KNOW I'M- I GREW UP IN CANADA. WHEN I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA THE STARTING SALARY FOR A FACULTY MEMBER IN THE FLOPPY OF EDUCATION WAS THE SAME AS THE SALARY FOR SOMEBODY WHO BEEN TEACHING FOR. EIGHT YEARS. SO THEY WERE AND IT WAS REGARDED AS YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER. AND YOU WERE DOING A GREAT JOB YOU WERE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS A FACULTY MEMBER AT THE UNIVERSITY. SO I THINK THAT WE NEED A SHIFT IN TERMS OF OUR VALUE SYSTEM AND THAT ALSO ENTAILS A SHIFT IN TERMS OF. PAY SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA TALK A LOT ABOUT FUNDING CLEARLY- I WOULD LOOK TO LAST YEAR'S- COMPUTER SCIENCE STANDARDS THAT WERE ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THEM WAS THE CAN'T BE A MANDATE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE FUND THOSE THINGS AND IMPLEMENTS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPUTER SCIENCE STANDARDS. INTO THE CLASSROOMS ON A DAILY BASIS THAT BECAUSE IT'S AN UNFUNDED MANDATE IT IT ISN'T CURRENTLY. ROCK IN CLASSROOMS A LOT OF THOSE STANDARDS INCLUDE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT OF ENSURING THAT THERE ITS ACTIVITY BASED- PLAY LIKE THINGS SO THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT COMPUTER SCIENCE LOOKS LIKE BUT YOU CAN'T REQUIRE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTER SCIENCE THE CLASSROOM WITHOUT IT THE FUNDING. HI IF I COULD DO A MAY. WAND AND THE ASPIRATIONAL OUT. THE POLICY ITEM THAT COULD BE DONE IT WOULD BE- MANDATING AND FUNDING ALL PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE NOT TO SAY EVERY STUDENT HAS TO TAKE IT BUT- EVERY SINGLE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL MUST OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE. THAT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO DO IN ONE SESSION- IS SO IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE REALISTIC AND MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM ARE ADVOCATING FOR IS INCREASING THE FUNDING FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS. AND PROVIDING AS INCENTIVE TO TEACHERS. SO MAKING SURE IT'S NOT JUST. GIVING THAT THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT THE FUNDING BUT ALSO MAKING SURE YOU'RE COVERING THE TEACHER. I AM. A SUBSTITUTE OF TIME AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM. POTENTIALLY OBSCENE REQUESTED TO A REALLY GREAT JOB TEXAS AND IN NEW YORK AMONG THEM. OUR ACTUALLY GIVE TEACHER IN TERMS OF THOUSAND. FOR TWO. THAT PRESSURE TO. COURSES GREAT. THE YOU MY. I WITH TO CONTINUE THIS JUST IN FOR OUR- AND THE CITY THEY ARE NINE THAT CAN'T BUT I OF BY HAVE ONE FINE QUESTION BEFORE I ALLOW FOR PUBLIC COMMON I BUT A IT'S FOR MISS VAN METER YOU KNOW WE- YOU KNOW AS- FROM YOUR PURSE. AS A T. IN A REF OF THE CAL TEACHERS ASSOCIATION HOW YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO TO THE COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHER SHORTAGE SOUL- WE ACTUALLY- AGREE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE- OF ACTUAL. OF WASTE OR A PIPELINE TO DO THAT I KNOW THAT IN OUR OWN C. P. D. OR IN THIS CASE THE- CREDENTIAL AND PROFESSIONAL- COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE. WE ARE LOOKING INTOTHAT AND WE HAVE CREDENTIALS DAD'S ARE ARE ALREADY IN PLACE AND I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FOR HOW THE TEACHERS TO KIND OF GO IN AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT EITHER GET A SUPPLEMENTARY CONVENTIONAL OR SOMETHING TO CONNECT A CORPORATION THAT THEY HAVE IT UPDATED VERSION OF WHAT WE NEED. OKAY YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU TO BE A COULD SCIENCE KNOW OUR DON'T NEED TO SIGN CORRECT I MEAN ALL OF YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP IN. IF WE WANT TO INCREASE COMPUTER SCIENCE IN CALIFORNIA AT ALL LEVELS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. GETTING THE PEOPLE INTERESTED AND PREPARED TO TEACH YOU KNOW I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THIS IS THEIR DREAM JOB TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE EITHER AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL K. TWELVE- BUT THERE IS. THERE IS IT LIKE A PATH WAIT RIGHT ROUTE IT'S CLEAR TO EVERYONE AND I THINK AS LEGISLATORS THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN. WORK TOWARDS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF YOU THAT ARE HERE TODAY RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO BILLS. THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT CAME FROM THE LARGEST CHAIR SO I KNOW THAT THAT JUST KINDA CAME IN AND SO SEE. ON THE COMPANY. OF OR CREDENTIALING IS LOOK AT THAT. SO WE ALWAYS WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE WE- WE ALWAYS WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR STUDENTS AS WELL ART AS OUR TEACHERS SO IN THIS CASE I THINK NAPA. ON INCOME. THEN A WHAT. FOR ALL. GRAY THANK. YOU SO MUCH TO ALL OF OUR HAND TO. I LOOK FOR TO WORKING EVERY TO COULD CALIFORNIA'S CAN. OUT. I NOW MOVE TO POP VOMIT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SINCE. PEOPLE THAT ARE WAITING TO COMMENT ON IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PUBLIC. A LINE UP AT THE MIKE SO YOUR NAME AND ORG. AND TO BE RESPECTFUL OF TIME- PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTE SO. THE RIGHT ARM MARK EPSTEIN DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION NETWORK LAST YEAR I SERVED AS A MEMBER OF THE SACRAMENTO DIGITAL LITERACY TASK FORCE. AND BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN I SERVED AS FAR AS ON A NASA TASK FORCE BASED OUT OF GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER. IN MARYLAND ON INCORPORATING GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY IN THE K. TWELVE CLASSROOMS. IN THE CITY ONE OF THINGS I HAVE NOTICED SINCE THE TWENTY ELEVEN EXPERIENCES I HAVE SEEN AS FAR AS PROGRESS MADE. IN OTHER STATES VERSUS CALIFORNIA. THERE'S ONE UNDERLYING ISSUE AS FAR AS ON A LOT OF DISCUSSION HERE THAT HAS NOT BEEN RAISED. IS THAT I HAVE NOTICED THAT THOSE STATES THAT ARE MAKING PROGRESS ARE STATES THAT HAVE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S THAT ARE VERY PROACTIVE DEALING WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY. AND CALIFORNIA'S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IT'S EXTREMELY PASSIVE I MEAN THE AD IN TILL WE WORK ON CHANGING THE CULTURE. AND THE POLICIES IN OUR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE ARE GOING TO GET NO WHERE THE DEPARTMENT THEIR CULTURE IS WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNLESS IT'S IN A FRAMEWORK OR A STANDARD. AND WE KNOW HOW FREQUENTLY THAT DOES GET UPDATED IN CHANGES CHANGES IN THE OTHER THING AS FAR AS KEEPING UP OR PROMOTING ANYTHING AS FAR AS ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WE LEAVE IT UP TO THE PUBLISHERS AND THE DEVELOPERS. AND SCHOOLS REACT TO THE PUBLISHERS AND DEVELOPERS AS SALES PERSONS. AND WITH THE BRAT WITH WITH THE INCREASING RAPIDITY OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WHAT WE'RE DOING IN OUR CULTURE AND OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM. ISN'T PROVIDING WHAT IS NEEDED FOR OUR K. TWELVE STUDENTS TO SUCCEED IN FACT LET RECENTLY WITHIN THE LAST YEAR I'VE STARTED PICKING UP THAT WE'RE NOW. JUST A STRAY. I OUT. IN LETTERS. LETTER GAS. TO A WORKFORCE COMPETITIVENESS GAP AND I MEAN JUST HERE WITH THIS HEARING ITS TITLE IN ITS EMPHASIS AS FAR AS COMPUTER SCIENCE. MINCED OF HOW BALLING HOT MORE AT YOUR TO WE'RE DEALING WITH IT IN A WOMEN I FOR OVER. BROUGH NOW MULTI TOUCH IT IS IT'S A- IT TECH IT'S DID YOU LITERACY IT'S JACK'S LOOK DOT COMPUTERS. NEED TO BROAD THAT'S BEANS SELL SELL OUR STUDENTS THE AND- I'M IF THEY DON'T BECOME. OF LACK COMPETITOR IN THE- EIGHT AND FIVE NOW IS FAR AS ON THE ISSUE I ALSO A THE CLASS PROVIDING LOG DO AND ONE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE GRAY SURPRISE AND IS RATHER HELLO WHICH IS CÃ¡C IN. THIS HI MINORITY HI IMMIGRANT SECOND LANGUAGE AND THIS PAST YEAR FROM THE- WEB MAPPING MANY COURSE OF WHAT WE DO WE FEEL THE TEAM AND CALIFORNIA'S STORYMAP COMPETITION AND LAST SPRING THEY SWEPT THE COMPETITION DEFEATING THEM AFFLUENCE ARE THE MORE AFFLUENT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN NOT BELIES THAT COMPETITION FOR YEARS- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I'M ISABEL GARCIA I'M A CTA LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE BUT I'M I WANT TO THANK THE DISTINGUISHED PANELS AND ALSO- MANAGER FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING I'M I'M ACTUALLY GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WORKS I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING ONE DAUGHTER. AND SHE'S TWENTY SEVEN NOW BUT I WOULD KEPT PUSHING THE SCIENCES MATH AND SCIENCES AND I WANT TO TELL YOU- WHAT WORKED THAT I THINK IS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IN AND OUT SCHOOL- ON IT THAT WORKED AT BUT I THINK IT'S NOT AS WELL KNOWN SO ONE OF THEM IS THE CSU CAMPUS. HERE IN SACRAMENTO AT TALENTS. AND THEY HAVE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO OFFER COURSES FOR STUDENTS IN GRADES SIX THROUGH NINE AND THE RISK SHE WAS INTERESTED IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS I MEAN FOLLOWING AT THE INTEREST- THEY HAD CODING EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVEN GET HIGH CREDIT. AND I KNOW HOW MANY THE C. OFFER AT THE CHALLENGERS THINK THE NEWS OF. FOR ALL ASPECTS OF EVERY KEY. WE EVER BEING OFF. ARM OFF. I THINK SHOULD BE YOU OWN WIDELY PROMOTED THE OTHER THING THAT- I LIVE HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I HAD TO SEND MY DAUGHTER JUST SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO GO TO A CAMP OF FEMALE SCIENTISTS FOR A WEEK. FROM THE SCIENCE OF MAKE UP TO MARINE BIOLOGY SO I THINK PROMOTING MORE. IT'S NOT SHE TOOK THE SOCCER CAMPS SO IT'S F. LENNIX OF COURSE BUT WHY NOT ALSO HAVE THE MUSIC AND ALSO OF THE SCIENCE- AND THEN THE OTHER- I JUST BOUGHT A BOOK FOR A BABY SHOWER. IT'S CALLED EXTRA FOR ITS WERE BABIES SO WHEN YOU SAY HELLO HOW YOUNG CAN WE START. YEAR OLD YES. THAT YOUNG. AND THEN YOU TO ABOUT THE GAMING MY IT MIGHT MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO. SO SHE GREW UP WITH MACHINES AND THE GAME BOYS AND THE VIDEO GAMES AND SHE REALLY WANTED TO GO TO UC RIVER. SIDE AND GET A DEGREE IN GAMING BUT OF COURSE THERE WERE MANY OBSTACLES THERE AND ONE OF THE OBSTACLES YOU ENCOUNTER WAS THE ALGORITHMS AND SHOULD NEVER REALLY. BEEN INTRODUCED THAT IN CASE FOR TWELVE SYSTEM SO I THINK IT WAS UNTIL SHE GOT TO COLLEGE SO I THINK THAT AGAIN. YEAH ALL OF THESE IT TAKING THEIR INTERESTS AND- I YOU KNOW I REMEMBER THE COMICON CONVENTIONS THAT SHE USED TO GO TO WHY DON'T WE HAVE BRUCE AIR ABOUT. YOU KNOW GIRLS IN CODING OR WHATEVER I MEAN P. S. A.'S IN YOUR COMMUNITIES THERE'S A LOT WE COULD DO. THAT THAT SOME OF THE PTA- YOU KNOW. THEY COULD BE. PROMOTING MORE OF. THE UNDER UTILIZED MUSEUMS AND ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES IN EACH COMMUNITY IF YOU HAVE IT ON SCIENCE. WHATEVER SO ANYWAY THOSE ARE COMMENTS HIS APPEARANCE THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS JESSICA SOCCER I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA STEM NETWORK A PROJECT OF CHILDREN NOW I'D LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AND HER STAFF FOR CONVENING THIS. IMPORTANT HEARING- WHERE WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE NEED FOR A CONTINUED IN ROBUST INVESTMENT IN STEM EDUCATION IN OUR STATE NOT ONLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. WHAT RESOURCES MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION BUT ALSO THE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OF OUR TEACHER WORK FORCE T. K. TO TWELVE. AS WELL AS AND THIS IS INVESTMENT KEEP. IDEALLY WOULD BE SUSTAINED AND ROBUST AND NOT IN ONE TIME FUNDING AS THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL SHIFT AND MOVEMENT THAT WILL REQUIRE MANY YEARS TO IMPLEMENT. IN ADDITION WE ALSO LIKE TO SEE INVEST IN OUR STEM TEACHER WORK FORCE THAT REALLY TARGETS THE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES. OF A STEM TEACHER RICK. HIGH QUALITY STEM TEACHERS THEIR UNIQUE CHALLENGES SPECIFIC TO STEM TEACHERS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL AS DIVERSIFYING OUR TEACHER WORK FORCE THANK YOU. Q. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE- THAT JOINED US HERE TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC- IN THE HEARING IS NOW ADJOURNED THANKS.
