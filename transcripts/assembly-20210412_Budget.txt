MR FOR. I'M RT COMMITTEE- ON SB EIGHTY FIVE- WHAT IS THE ACTION FOR PER HERE IS THAT I CATCH UP ON WHAT WAS PROMISED UNDER S. B. NINE OH ONE IS THAT MY UNDERSTANDING. HI THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I WILL TURN OVER THE SPECIFICS TO MY COLLEAGUE- IT'S EVEN WELL I BELIEVE THE COMBINED. HM MORNING THANK YOU GOOD MORNING STEVEN BENSON BERMAN FOR- THE EACH THE CAP AND ARGUE G. R. F. PORTION A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE NO. IS KIND OF A CATCH UP IF YOU WILL IT'S TO ME SB NINE A ONE PORTION. THAT WAS LEFT OUT OF THE BUNCH WENT MISSING AND I. THE SO AT THE END OF THE WHAT IS YOUR FUND PIECES REPORTER. BACK AND THAT IS THAT THE HAVE THE GENERAL PIECES A- BY THE I KNOW WHAT. HAD A ONE BILLION OVER FOR YEARS AND SO THIS WOULD WHICH WOULD BE A- UP OF WELL WHAT WASN'T. AND IN. THE LAST BUDGET THAT WAS DONE. CORRECT. FRET OKAY- AND THEN DO YOU. ANY ANY SENSE- OF AND MAYBE THE IS A NOT THE PURVIEW OF THIS HERE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE NEXT DID YOU DO IT. AND CAN OF THIS AND. NINE NINE A ONE PROMISED TO DO ANOTHER- WE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THE NEXT IN THE GYM BUDGET. SO THE GUY BURN PROPOSED TO CA. MEETING THOSE S. NINE ONE OF NATION'S AS WELL AS TO CONTINUE IT AN ADDITIONAL FEW YEAR BEYOND WHAT SB WANTED ITSELF OKAY SO THERE'S A THERE'S AN EXPECTED THAT THAT THAT THAT THE FUTURE BUDGETS WILL WILL MAINTAIN THIS A PROMISE UNDER HAS BEEN AT A ONE. CORRECT OKAY- IN IN TERMS OF- PRESCRIBED BURNING BURNS AND- A VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE KNOW THOSE ARE OUR OFFICE THE PROVEN OF FOREST FIRE PREVENTION TECHNIQUES- I DON'T PROGRESS IN A- ANY GUARANTEES IN THIS BILL THAT FUNDING WILL GO TO. TO THESE MITIGATION AND PREVENTION EFFORTS. SO WHAT INSURANCE IS THAT WE HAVE THAT THIS FUNDING. WILL ACTUALLY USE FOR PRESCRIBED BURNS AND ENVELOPE AND FORCE MANAGEMENT- AND IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT ACTUALLY STREAMLINES. PROVIDES STREAMLINING I'M THROUGH A PROCESS. SO THERE'S FIFTEEN MILLION MEDISPA TO PRESCRIBE FOR HIM. WITHIN THE EARLY AFTER PACKET WHICH IN ADDITION- THE FOREST HEALTH FIRE PER. AND GRANT FUNDING- CAN GO TOWARDS GRANTS THAT WOULDN'T PROJECT THAT MIGHT BE. PRESCRIBED BURN PRESCRIBER AND ISN'T AS A COURSE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE VARIOUS METHODS CAN BE USED FOR FUEL REDUCTION. FOR FIRE METHOD OPERATING GO BREAK THINGS THAT SO- I THAT THERE'S NO LIKINGS SPLIT IS TO HELP OF THAT FUNDING WHICH FOR FIRE WHILE THIS DEPEND ON THE PRICE THAT ARE PART. IN ONES GET. BUT BUT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT YOU KNOW NUMBER OF THOSE PROJECTS INCLUDE PRESCRIBED FIRES WELL IT'S KIND OF A MECHANIZED- APPROACHES TO PEOPLE'S FUTURE. AND THAT'S THE I GUESS THE BIG CAN. IS THAT YOU KNOW MUCH OF THE FUN WILL BE OUT. TO THE TECHNIQUES VERSUS OTHER THINGS THAT MAY NOT. BE AS EFFECTIVE BUT- MOVING ON TO THE- TO SB ADDED TO THE DJJ REALIGNMENT- CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME INPUT IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW IF THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN CONSULTED- AND ANDY'S REALIGNMENT PLANS. HI YES I'M GOING TO TURN UP OVER SPIKE ALAN HULETT. ALISON SHE DEPART OF FINE I COUNTY BEEN. THERE'S BEEN A OF A I'LL TRYOF STATE THAT. BEEN IN THE IN TURN OF- UP FOR ME THAT THAT NINETY AS A NOW AND TELL ME HOW BEEN IN THE IN ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS. OKAY AND THEN MAYBE YOU CAN- SAYS THAT HAVE YOU CAN'T CAN YOU. FIX WHY THIS IS BEING IN A IN A BUDGET BILL NOW OF. WAITING THE POLICY COMMITTEES AND DOES THE REGULAR PROCESS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY IT MAKES SENSE TO DO SB NINETY TWO AND MAKE THESE CHANGES NOW I'M THE FIRST IS THAT THE- REALIGNMENT. OF AND DID OF USE THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE GONE TO DJJ STARTS JULY FIRST SO WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO. WAIT OUTSIDE BECAUSE COUNTIES WILL BE EVEN OF- PROVIDING TO THESE YOUTH IN SERVICE TO THESE YOU STARTING ONE. AND THERE WAS A KIND OF A RECOGNITION THAT THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A FOLLOW ON BILL- FOR EXAMPLE- UP PART OF WHAT SB NINETY TWO DOZEN IS OUR A FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY YOU TREATMENT FACILITIES. AND- IN B. E. TWO THREE ONE WHICH WAS A LAW YEAR AND THERE WAS A GOAL OR INTENT LANGUAGE BEST. THAT SUCH- A FRAMEWORK WOULD COME FORWARD BY MARCH FIRST SO OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT. LATER THAN PLANNED BUT SO THAT'S AN ESSENTIALLY WHY THIS IS THAT NEEDS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED NOW AND THERE'S ALL THERE ARE ALSO FISCAL IMPLICATIONS- WHICH IS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING FUNDING TO COUNTIES- IN DOING THAT SO. HOPEFULLY THAT. ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION- BABY I'M GONNA THE L. A. L. THEIR AND ON ON THIS PROPOSAL AND PLANS CURRENT AS THEY SAY FOR REALIGNMENT WHAT IS YOUR NOW. THANK YOU ARE YOU WOULD LIKE TO- HIM THAT QUESTION OVER VICE CHAIR TO MY COLLEAGUE LUKE BECAUSE MARK. MOREOVER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ARE NOT TAKING A POSITION ON THE SPECIFIC- PIECE OF LEGISLATION- WE HAVE WORKED OFTEN WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE. ADMINISTRATION DESPITE ON THAT PROPOSAL AND THE WORKING I THOUGHT TO WOULD BE EIGHTY SOME SORT OF FOLLOW- THAT WE ARE NOT A POSITION SPECIFIC LUXURY. AFFECTS QUESTION YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE BILLING WHAT WAS YOUR IF YOU CAN REFRESH MY MEMORY WAS YOUR- OR WHAT WAS THE- YEAR PER SPECT ON. THE RIVER PLAN. ACTUALLY WE ARE SOME CONCERN ON SPACE LANGUAGE- AS WELL AS THE FIRST CAMERA WHETHER WHAT THEY'RE PROBABLY APPROACH WOULD BE TO TAKE RESTORE THE OF YOUR JUST WE DID NOT RAISE- SPECIFIC RECOMMEND. ON THAT REQUIRED ME ITSELF MORE A WITH LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL THAT COULD ISSUES TRYING TO. AT HOW WHEN WE SHOULD BE STRUCTURED. FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG I BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION WAS WHY WE'RE DOING THIS NOW VERSUS IN JUNE. YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION- SO BUT ALSO WHETHER THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN ON EVERY AND WHAT WHAT COUNTY INPUT HAS BEEN PROVIDED- AS WELL I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR THE LAST PART OF WHAT WHAT WHAT COUNTY INPUT HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN THE COUNTY. SURE A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM THEM GOT IT THANK YOU- SO THEY DJJ REALIGNMENT EFFORT WAS STARTED LAST YEAR ONE OF THE MAIN PROVISIONS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUDED. IN LAST YEAR'S BILL WITH THE SECURE TRACK POLICY AND THIS IS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS AND THE COUNTIES WHAT TO DO WITH THE LIMITED NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN SENT TO DJJ- WHEN DJ IS NO LONGER AN OPTION- AT THE TIME THE LEGISLATURE WAS PUSHING TO INCLUDE THIS POLICY- WE REALIZE THAT WE NEEDED A BROADER STAKEHOLDER INPUT. AND BETWEEN THE SUMMER AND THE PUT UP UNTIL THIS POINT WE RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM JUVENILE COURT JUDGE JUDGES-THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS C. SACK AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS IN DEVELOPING THIS- AND THE REASON WHY IT'S NEEDED NOW- IS BECAUSE INTAKE FOR DJJ. SET TO CLOSE IN JUNE. AND THE COURTS SEEKING THIS. AS THEY ARE- DEALING WITH CASES- AT THE MOMENT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT- AND LASTLY IF I COULD JUMP TO YOU- SB NINETY THREE- AND CERTAINLY THIS BILL PROPOSES- SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON EMPLOYERS- HIRING ABILITY- AND THERE'S A NEW LIABILITY IMPLICATIONS AS WELL- WHAT OPTIONS UNDER THIS BILL WILL EMPLOYERS HAVE TO APPEAL ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST THEM- IF THEY'VE ALREADY MADE EFFORTS TO RE HIRE FORMER EMPLOYEES. AND ARE THERE ANY INCENTIVES PROVIDED TO BUSINESSES TO REHIRE EMPLOYEE FORMER EMPLOYEES AS WELL- YES MR FONG I WILL TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE DAVID WALTER WHO IS JOINING US WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. GOOD MORNING VICE CHAIR OF THE ANSWER TO THAT IS WITH OTHER ON CITATIONS OR A SET SINCE THEY'RE MADE AGAINST EMPLOYERS EMPLOYERS WOULD HAVE FULL OPPORTUNITY TO ALL APPEAL. ANY IS A PROPOSAL ASSESSMENT AND HAVE A FULL DUE PROCESS HEARING ALL BEFORE ANY SUCH YOU BETTER BECAME FINAL- ADDITIONALLY ON HIS YOU'LL NOTE THERE'S EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO ENFORCE THESE PROVISIONS AND SO IT'S OUR NORMAL PRACTICE. OF TRYING TO INTERVENE EARLY WITH AN EMPLOYER WILL BE GET NOTICE OF ALL POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS SUCH THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WALK TO CURE IT IS SOON AS YOU KNOW WE'RE. WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND NOTIFY THEM. SO THERE IS THAT SO THERE IS A RIGHT TO GET IT IS THAT THERE IS NO RIGHT TO ACTION HERE IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT PAGA IS NOT. INVOLVED IN THIS. WHAT THE WAY TO THE LEGISLATION IS WRITTEN PROVIDES THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. AND THAT THESE ARE THE OLD THE PROVISIONS ARE PROVIDED AND TWENTY EIGHT TEN POINT EIGHT. WOULD BE THE ONLY- MEANS FOR ENFORCEMENT OF. OF THESE SAW PROVISIONS WHICH- SUNSET AT THE END OF LONG. OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND- ONLY RELATED TO- CODE RELATED SEPARATION POINT. OKAY AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION I GUESS- IS CAN YOU WAY N. ON THE POTENTIAL ON CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS BILL IN TERMS OF HOW TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL SQUARE WITH THE FACT THAT. MANY OF THESE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE HIRED AT WILL. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT ARGUMENT OR ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AT ALL. THAT SAID OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY TO CALL CREATE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS THAT- THAT TOGGLE BEYOND WHATEVER ALL EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENT OR EXIST BETWEEN AN EMPLOYER AND AN EMPLOYEE AND- THAT'S YOU KNOW. SIMILAR PROVISIONS ARE THROUGHOUT THE LABOR CODE AND AS FAR AS I AM MY UNDERSTANDING HAVE BEEN HELD TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL IN THE PAST. OKAY I GUESS WE'LL HAVE THAT DISCUSSION- BUT I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN THAT THAT THAT I HAVE- THAT THIS BILL MAY IMPAIR THAT PRE EXISTING OBLIGATIONS. UNDER SOME OF THE CAUSES OF THE US AND CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION BUT- I CELEBRATED THE ANSWERED THANK YOU TAKE CARE. THANK YOU NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER COOPER AND THE MISTER RAMOS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- LAST WEEK REFORM TORQUE- THAT A COMPROMISE BEEN REACH WITH THE GOVERNOR ON THE WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCY BILL. THERE WAS NO MENTION DISCUSSION OF THE OTHER TRAILER BILLS RELATED TO JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT ARE RE HIRING OF DISPLACED WORKERS. THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY IN FACT WE WERE NOT AWARE OF THESE ISSUES UNTIL FRIDAY AT FIVE TWENTY SIX. WHAT ARE CHIEF OF STAFFS RECEIVE YOUR GENDER WHICH INCLUDED THESE ISSUES. WITH BY THE MERITS OR FLAWS THESE PROPOSALS THIS PROCESS GIVES US VERY LITTLE TIME TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THESE PROPOSAL'S. IMPACT WE WILL HAVE OUR DISTRICTS I'M NOT SURE THE RUSHES- IN ADDITION WORRY ONCE AGAIN ADDRESSING POLICY ISSUES THEY'RE NOT BUDGET ISSUES. THIS CONTACTED TIME PERIOD OF THE BUDGET PROCESS- GOING TO- APS SB NINETY TWO OF THAT SOME QUESTIONS- WE TALK ABOUT SECURE YOU'VE. TREATMENT FACILITIES- THREE COUNTY THIS THEIR OWN. BUT YOU'VE GOT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY. SO YOU HAVE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT SECURE TREATMENT FACILITY IS THAT CORRECT. THIS IS ALLISON HERE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STILL THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES I'M AND THERE IS A- MORE LICENSING REQUIREMENT THAT COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME STRUCTURE IN PLACE HOWEVER SB. NINETY TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN OF COUNTY HEALTH MY MEET THAT WERE. I'M AND THAT INCLUDES CON THE WITH OTHER- IF THEY WANTED TO SOME TYPE OF REGIONAL APPROACH. AMBASSADOR ARE AT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN THERE ARE OPTIONS IN TERMS OF HOW COUNTIES WOULD MEET THAT REQUIREMENT BUT RIGHT NOW THE DJJ LOOK AT SOME OTHER PROGRAMS ARE AWARD WINNING PROGRAMS THEY HAVE FOR REHABILITATION FOR THESE FOLKS. AND THAT'S COME ABOUT BECAUSE DJS BEEN SUED AS HAS DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS OVER THE YEARS BY THE PRISON LAW OFFICE SO. THEY'VE BEEN. A LOT OF LOS IN. THE TENS OR HUNDREDS OF MILLION DOLLARS PAID OUT TO GET THEM TO WHERE THEY ARE. SO NOW THAT IS GOING DOWN THE COUNTIES- ROUTING THE COUNTY JAILS BEING SUED ALREADY BY THE PRISON LAW OFFICE. MULTIPLE LAWSUITS STATEWIDE FOR MEDICAL CARE AND OTHER ISSUES. SO IN MY MIND. I SEE MORE THIS COMING BECAUSE THESE- PROBATION DEPARTMENTS REALLY WERE BILL FOR THIS. AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IN ESSENCE YOU HAVE GROWN MEN. TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAN IN THE FACILITIES WALKING AROUND. WITH THAT YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT THE AGE AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW- AND IN THE POPULATION A DJ WITH A HUNDRED FIFTY. WAS DOWN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SO WHEN IT SAYS IT'S GONNA BE EQUAL I DON'T SEE IT BEING EQUAL MONTHLY COUNTIES AND YEAH. SOME COUNTY MAKE CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTY BUT- THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S GONNA BE DONE DIFFERENT WAYS SO I GUESS. WHAT MY QUESTION IS DJJ HAS MASTERED THIS OVERTIME. THROUGH TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS. THE COUNTIES ARE GONNA HIT THE GROUND RUNNING DAY ONE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. SO I SEE MORE OF THIS AND IF ANYTHING I SEE REGRESSION. SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU COUNTER THAT THERE'S- WE WILL BE TAKING TWO STEPS BACK. IN PURSUING THIS IN GOING FORWARD WITH THIS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I GUESS IT WOULD SAVE YOU A PART OF THIS IS THAT THE THIS DECISION ON THE REALIGNMENT TO COUNTIES WAS DECIDED AT IT V. I. S. B. TWO THREE WHICH WAS ENACTED LAST YEAR THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S ALLOCATED- THAT IS KIND OF IT. BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS OF THE YOUTH THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE A LOT REAL LINES THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NUMBER IS REALLY THE YOUTH THAT WOULD STILL BE ACTED JJ AT THE TIME OF THE PLANT CLOSURE AND SO. I WOULD SAY THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED- AS A PART OF- I SPEAK TO THREE WHICH WAS THE AT THE BILL ENACTED LAST YEAR TO PREPARE PLANS- THAT. DISCUSS THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES THAT THEY AND SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD BE OFFERING RELYING TO USE THAT THAT IS- AS A PART OF THE CONDITION OF FUNDING. AND CERTAINLY THOSE PLANS WOULD PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS THAT SB TWO THREE SPECIFIED TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS. AS THE GOAL AGAIN IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO BE MOST. SUCCESSFUL AND ULTIMATELY A DECISION. THAT THE POLICY HERE IS THAT- THERE'S A BELIEF THAT YOUTH WOULD BE MORE SUCCESSFUL BEING A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO HOME. AND THAT WAS REALLY THE PREMISE FOR THE REALIGNMENT LAST YEAR AND SO HOPEFULLY BETWEEN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT KIND OF FRAMEWORKS AND PROCESSES THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN SB EIGHT TO THREE. AND THAT THIS BILL- ESSENTIALLY KIND OF. STRUCTURED AROUND THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO PROVIDE COUNTIES- SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF SERVICE THIS. TWENTY HEAR FOLKS TALK ABOUT BEING CLOSER HOME BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY WALK THE WALK WHEN IT COMES TO- THE CDC ARE FOLKS BEING CLOSER TO HOME. SO MANY TALK ABOUT TECHNICAL CONFORMING CHANGES. WHAT COULD CHANGE. THERE ARE THOSE THAT'S VERY VAGUE. YEAH A COUPLE OF THE EXAMPLES HAPPY TO WALK YOU THROUGH A FEW FIRST OF ALL THE BILL SPECIFIES THE DJJ CLOSER DATE OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND SO WE HAVE TO SUNSET VARIOUS PROVISIONS THAT WOULD APPLY- THAT WON'T APPLY ESSENTIALLY AFTER THAT TIME SO THAT'S A PART OF WHAT WE REFER TO THE TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING CHANGES THERE WAS ALSO. TWENTY NINETEEN LEGISLATION THAT CREATED SB EIGHT TO THREE- AND SO THERE WERE JUST AND KIND OF CLEAN UPS WERE MAKING SURE THAT DJ IS REFERRED TO APPROPRIATELY OR THAT CODE SECTION REFERENCES- ARE CORRECT. SO YOU SEE THAT THOSE ARE I'M HAPPY TO KIND OF I PROVIDE MORE SPECIFICS AT YOUR OFFICE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THEY REALLY ARE KIND OF TECHNICAL IN NATURE IN THAT IT'S JUST MAKING SURE THAT THE CODE SECTIONS ARE. KIND OF. APPLICABLE AS THEY SHOULD BE AND THAT THERE'S CLARIFICATION IN THE STATUTES AND I DJ IS IT IS REFERENCED BY THE APPROPRIATE NAME FOR EXAMPLE. SURE AND ALL THE POLLS ON THIS YEAH WE'RE DOING TO THE COUNTIES AND COUNTIES CAN CONTACT OTHER COUNTIES. BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE REALIGNMENT FROM THE- JAILS. THINGS ARE DONE IN A MYRIAD OF WAYS AND A LOT OF PROGRAMS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE SO. YOU KNOW IN MY HUMBLE OPINION THIS IS. WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE OF THAT. ARE BEING DONE DIFFERENT NOT HAVING AWARD WINNING THING- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND SWITCH GEARS TO- SB NINETY THREE. IT COOPER AT THE DISTRICT MISMAS QUE OKAY SO YOUR QUESTION AND THEN SURE FOR TO GO TO SB NINETY THREE- JENNIFER CAME WITH THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE ONE PIECE OF CONTEXT I WANTED TO PROVIDE YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT. CURRENTLY THERE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE ANNUALLY THAT COULD BE SENT TO THE DJJ. THAT COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY KEEPING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM SO ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND UP POINTED THE DJJ. AND CELL COUNTIES ALREADY HAVE. BUILT IN CAPACITY TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE- SB EIGHT TO THREE HELPS TO FILL THE GAP. FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE STILL- NEEDING SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND IT DOES ALLOW FOR PARTNERSHIPS AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT FINANCE HAS MENTIONED- SO- YOU KNOW THE. THE KIND OF D. AND THEN. OF YOUNG PEOPLE BE SAID TO DJ- IT'S LARGELY DUE- EMPIRE. TO THE- HAVING BILL UP THERE COULD PASS. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS TO TACKLE THIS POPULATION SO THREE HUNDRED THAT. WERE PREVIOUSLY GOING TO DJJ WERE THE PRETTY MUCH THE WORST THE WORST. SEMESTER THOSE FOLKS BEING A DJJ. THEY'RE GONNA BE THE CALIBRATION APARTMENTS. I WOULD SAY THAT- THE THREE HUNDRED OR SO YOUNG PEOPLE DEPENDING ON KIND OF WHAT. WE CHARACTERIZE THEM AS THE HIGH NEEDS POPULATIONS A SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SOME OF THEM HAVE- OTHER KIND OF CRIMINAL GENIC KIND OF- ISSUES- THERE IS CAPACITY AT THE COUNTY- AND THEN. THE RESOURCES ARE ARE BEING PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER USER PER YEAR IS TO HELP SUPPORT- SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING. WHEN YOU SEE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT GOES UP TO AGE TWENTY FIVE CORRECT. THAT IS THE AGE OF JURISDICTION THAT'S CURRENTLY AT DJJ THAT WE ARE- REPLICATING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK MOST OF US IN HERE DON'T CONSIDER PEOPLE UNDER AGE TWENTY FIVE IN THEIR TWENTIES YOUNG PEOPLE AT LEAST I DON'T- SOCIAL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. IT GOES BACK FUNDAMENTALLY THAT THE- DJJ HAS AN AWARD WINNING PROGRAM. YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE THAT COME OUT OF ANY COUNTY AND ALLOW WHERE MANY COUNTY THAT'S AWARD. WINNING PROGRAMMING DOING WITH SOME OF IT SOME OF THE ISSUES. WORDS MIL HEALTH OR SEXUAL OFFENDERS- I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OF IN IN THE STATE THAT HAVE THAT SO. ACCESS THE HORSES LEFT THE BARN ALREADY PURCHASED. IF WE REALLY WANT TO REHABILITATE PEOPLE- WE HAD A GREAT PROGRAM WE DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE SO IT'S JUST. IT'S FRUSTRATING ON MY PART OF YOUR THE FRUSTRATION IN MY VOICE- SO SWITCHING GEARS TO- SB NINETY THREE IN AB NINETY THREE. A SPECIFICALLY THE BILL BEFORE US. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SB NINETY THREE. AND A B. THREE THIRTY TO SIXTEEN FROM LAST YEAR. WITH THE GOVERNOR VETOED. YES I'VE HEARD THAT QUESTION OVER TO EITHER- DANIEL BRANDON OR DAVID FALTER TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE TWO BILLS. IN A DRESS OR WHAT WHAT I'M AWARE OF IN THAT REGARD- ALL OF THE THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN LAST YEAR PROVIDED THAT THE EMPLOYERS WOULD BE ALL REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. THE NAME THE NAMES OF EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HIRED. TO OTHER ALL LAID OFF EMPLOYEES AND- THIS NEW PROVISION OR WOMEN H. THAT- IT ALSO THIS BILL AS I INDICATED BEFORE IS WHEN. MADE IT ON TO THE COUPLE OF ITS STATE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE ONLY THIS IS THE SUNSETS AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. IN THE ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO WERE PROVIDED ANY OF. THE RIGHTS ARM SLOWLY. OF ON FULL OF CO. THE ACTION RELATED TO WITH. ARE THOSE ONLY DIFFERENCES. COMPARE THAT THAT IN AND FROM NINE THREE IN THE THIRD WHICH IS THE ONLY ONCE. I'M DANIELLE RENDON WITH PARTNER. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THERE ARE FEW OTHERS AND AB I'M SORRY YEAH SB EIGHT NINETY THREE ADDS A NEW SECTION IN THE LABOR CODE. AND WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY IT WAS JUST A MODIFICATION- IN SENIORITY- IS DEFINED IN THE SB NINETY THREE- WHERE IT WASN'T TO FIND BEFORE. AND SB NINETY THREE ALSO ADDS AS MR BALZER HAD MENTIONED EIGHTY S. SUNSET DATE OF SEPTEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. EMPLOYERS ARE FIVE DAYS AFTER THE JOB OFFER AND- KNOW THAT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT I HAVE LISTED HERE TO RESPOND SORRY FIVE DAYS AFTER THE JOB OFFER TO RESPOND TO THE EMPLOYER CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK MORE ABOUT THE SIX MILLION APPROPRIATED. IN S. B. NINETY THREE. SHARES SO THIS AMOUNT- IS THAT REFLECTS THE AMOUNTS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. SO INCLUDING RETALIATION COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS THE FIELD ENFORCEMENT AND THEN ALSO. H. INCLUDING EXPANDING- D. I. OURS MULTI LINGUAL OUTREACH AND THEN- I CANNOT TURN IT TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE I. R. IF HE HAS ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO ADD ON THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. FUNDING WOULD BE USED. GO AHEAD SORRY. YES UNDERSTAND THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED FOR OBVIOUSLY INVESTIGATORS TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS OF ALL VIOLATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALL IS WELL AS ATTORNEYS TO LITIGATE- ANY. I ELECTIONS THAT ARE NOT RESOLVED ASSIST THE OFF FIELD STAFF IN DOING THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND ALSO THERE BE PROVISIONS FOR- FOR AUDITORS IN THE CASE OF THE CASE NEEDED. WORKED UP. HAVE WE PREVIOUSLY VOTED ON PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. BUT NOT FOR THIS STATE. THAT I'M AWARE OF. THIS IS ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FUNDS TO DIR FEES BOB PROVISIONS. BUT I'M MAYBE I'M MISTAKEN BUT THOUGHT WE PROVIDED SOME FUNDS LAST YEAR IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES. MIKE MY INCORRECT. I'M DANIEL BRAND OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE WAS SIX MINUTES. CLEATED IN ABOUT BELIEVE IT WAS S. B. ONE FIFTEEN HOWEVER THOSE RESOURCES WERE NOT SPECIFIC TO THIS TYPE OF WORK WITH- AND SPECIFIC TO HOSPITALITY WORKERS BUT HIS ANY OF THAT MONEY BEING USED TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE THOUGH I MEAN WE'RE TALKING SIX MILLION. AND LAST BUDGET YEAR AND SIX MILLION THIS YEAR SO A TOTAL OF TWELVE MILLION THERE HAS TO BE SOME CROSS POLLINATION IN THAT. MISTER WALTER I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO SOME OF THE- FUNDING THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR DIFFERENT ENFORCEMENT AND IF THAT HAS BEEN UTILIZED. IF THAT'S BEEN COMPLETELY ALLOCATED- AT THIS POINT. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT ASPECT OF THE OF THE BILL ON SO I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF. FINANCE ON THAT. SO WHAT WILL HAVE TO GET SOME OF THE OTHER DETAILS FOR YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SURE THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. THE METRO TO MIAMI MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT MONEY WAS. APPROPRIATED FOR. THE PARTICULAR FOR WORKING HOSPITALITY WORKERS UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS ACCOMPANYING LEGISLATION THAT DID NOT GET SIGNED BECAUSE IT WASN'T POLICY AGREEMENT SO SINCE THERE WAS A SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING BUT NOT- ADEQUATE POLICY AGREEMENT THIS THIS REFLECTS THROUGH THE POLICY AGREEMENT. ON HOW TO SPEND THE SIX MILLION THAT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AS WELL AS THE MUD THE ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION WHICH IS IN THIS BILL. OKAY BUT I'M I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH OF LAST YEAR'S SIX MILLION TOUCH THIS ISSUE. FOR ME I'M I'M I'VE I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT A PORTION OF IT DID. WAS TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT IS A LOT OF MY AND MY UNDERSTANDING WAS. LAST YEAR IT WAS A VERY ODD SITUATION WHERE THE MONEY GOT IN THE BUDGET. BUT THERE WAS. NO POLICY DIRECTION AND SO THAT'S I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS. CLARIFICATION HERE IN THIS N THIS BUDGET IN THIS BUDGET BILL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE WAS- IT WAS SOMETHING THAT NEEDED TO BE FINISHED BUT NEVER GOT FINISHED DURING THE LAST BUDGET SURE SO WHAT SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT MONEY EVEN. IF THE MONEY STILL THE BUDGET THE SIX MORE FROM LAST YEAR YES. YES ALL WAS NEVER SPENT. THAT'S I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS BETTER NOT THAT IT WASN'T IT WAS APPROPRIATE IN THE BUDGET SO WAS IT SPEND. ROUGHLY MISTER COOPER MR TANG- I NEED TO FIND CLARIFICATION ON THAT SO I WILL DO THAT DURING THIS HEARING AND GET BACK TO YOU. SO I WOULD ASK IF IT WASN'T MEANT. WHERE WE SPENDING IT. THIS YEAR SO I THINK THAT'S FAIR. SO THE MONEY WAS DEFINITELY APPROPRIATE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I COULD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER RAMOS A NUMBER GOING TO GO TO MISTER BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IN MY FIRST- BUT QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS WILL BE ON S. B. EIGHTY FIVE WITH THE WHILE FACT FIRE EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS- THIS BILL- DISPERSES IMPORTANT RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE TO ENSURE WE ARE PREPARED FOR THE UPCOMING FIRE SEASON I WANNA THANK YOU FOR PUTTING- THE TWENTY TWO MILLION DIRECTLY INTO HOME HARDENING ASSISTANCE. AND ALSO HIGHLIGHTING- TO CALIFORNIA FOR TRAVELING GAUGE MINT- AND THE STEPS ARE NEEDED AND VITAL TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MY QUESTION ALSO IS AROUND THE STAFFING ELEMENT FOR OUR- STATE FIREFIGHTERS CAL FIGHTER IN THE FIRES THAT WE KNOW ARE COMING I KNOW LAST YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT- MAKING SURE THAT STAFFING WAS THERE AND WE SEE THE FIRES COME OUR WAY. AND THERE WAS FAR MORE ON OUTSIDE- FIREFIGHTERS COMING IN TO HELP WITH THE FIRES ARE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I JUST WNTED TO- ASK DOES. ANY OF THIS MONEY START TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT STAFF- ISSUES THAT WE ARE FOR HERE THE STATE. WITH OUR- CALIFORNIA FIRE HERE IN A OWN STAY. CUSTOMER AT ALTERNATIVE TO MY CAR STEPHEN. MORNING BASS WITH APARTMENT. SO THE FUNDING IN THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGE YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT GO TOWARDS STAFFING- FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION ACTIVITIES- THAT. THIS IS FOCUSED ON FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST RESILIENCE. THE STATE HAS INVESTED. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN RECENT YEARS TO EXPAND THE FIRE SUPPRESSION RESOURCES OF THE STATE AND WHAT WE RECOGNIZED IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE. I'M A CO PARTNER INVESTMENT IN FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST RESILIENCE THERE THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN. JUST WITH FIRE SUPPRESSION AND BREAK THE CYCLE OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE THAT WE'VE HAD THE SEWER THIS THIS IS FOCUSED ON MAKING STRATEGIC. INVESTMENTS IN A SHOVEL READY NEAR TERM PROJECTS. THAT CAN GIVE REAL FIRE PREVENTION AND REAL FORCE RESILIENCE BENEFITS- AND THE FIRE SUPPRESSION SIDE WHAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY AS WE DID DO AN AUGMENTATION. TO THE EMERGENCY FUND THAT PROVIDED- ABOUT EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FOR CAL FIRE TO BRING IN SEASONAL STAFFING EARLY AND GET A BETTER PREPARED FOR THE FIRE SEASON THAT'S ALREADY UPON US- IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A PROPOSALS THAT HELP- WITH ADDITIONAL CREWS AND RESOURCES IN THAT IN THAT NATURE SO. IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT FIRE SUPPRESSION RUN AROUND DOING THINGS ON IT BUT THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGE IS FOCUSED ON FIRE PREVENTION. AND FOREST RESILIENCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWERING THAT QUESTION BUT IT BEGS THE QUESTION OF IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE FIRE SUPPRESSION KEEPING A BALANCE. THAT THERE HAS TO BE THE TRUE DISCUSSION OF BOTH OF THEM ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH IN THE LEGISLATURE WITHIN THE BUDGET BUDGET CYCLE- MOVING FORWARD SO HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE THAT IN FUTURE BUDGET ITEMS. THE STARS TO ADDRESS THE STAFFING IN THE SAFETY OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I DO HAVE- OTHER QUESTIONS ON S. B. NINETY THREE- IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR. ON SB NINETY THREE. IT TALKS ABOUT HOW- BUSINESSES- RIGHT ARE ABLE TO- THEY HAVE FIVE BUSINESS DAYS. TO OFFER TO AN EMPLOYEE- TO COME BACK TO WORK IN THE EMPLOYEE HAS FIVE BUSINESS DAYS TO RESPOND. IS THAT CORRECT IN MY READING THAT CORRECTLY. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND THEN THE NEXT THE QUESTION IS THEN YOU HAVE THIRTY DAYS- TO RESPOND AS TO WHY- AN EMPLOYER HAS NOT HIRED SOMEBODY BACK UNDER THE COVERT. PARAMETERS ARE SET OUT IN THIS BILL MY QUESTION IS DO BOTH OF THOSE COMPONENTS GOAL WITH ONE ANOTHER MEANING THAT OF I HAVE AN EMPLOYEE AND I OFFER THEM BACK THEIR JOB. THEY TAKE IT THAT'S GREAT BUT IF THEY REFUSE DO I STILL HAVE TWO THEN HIGHLIGHT AND GIVE THE REASONS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF WHY I DIDN'T HIRE THEM. I'M GONNA TRY TO PATCH INTO MY COLLEAGUES FROM DR FOR SPECIFIC THANK YOU. YEAH IT DOES I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD ENFORCE IT. WHAT THEY END UP. TO LIVE. HIM THERE PLAYER IN MEETING THE ROB CATION. BY ALL. MAKING FINDING IT OUT ENQUIRING WHETHER THE EMPLOYEE IT READY TO ACCEPT THE JOB WHEN THE EMPLOYEE INDICATES THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE REASON TO ENFORCE PROVISIONS REQUIRED REASONS LATER ON. SO THEN- IT WAS BREAKING UP A LITTLE BIT MISTER CHAIR SO IT'S CLEAR THAT IF AN EMPLOYER- OFFERS AN EMPLOYEE TO HIRE THEM BACK UNDER THESE PARAMETERS AND THE EMPLOYEE HAS UP TO FIVE BUSINESS DAYS TO EITHER ACCEPT OR DENY THAT THAT OFFER IF THEY DENY IT WE'RE SAYING THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO STATE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS WHY THEY DID NOT HIRE THE INDIVIDUAL BACK. YEAH IN MY RESPONSE TO IT THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ENFORCEMENT OF THAT I CAN'T SEE US. IN FORCING IN A IN A MANNER WHICH ALL MAKES NO SENSE SUCH AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING ON IF THE EMPLOYEES IN. THE CASE THAT THEY DO NOT WANT THE JOB. THEN THE EMPLOYER MOVES ON TO THE NEXT HIGHER SINGLE PERSON ON THE LIST. THANK YOU FOR THAT NUMBER I JUST WANNA A THEN- CLARIFY AGAIN. THAT IN THIS- SB NINETY THREE THE ONE IN FRONT OF US NOW THERE DOES NOT HAVE. A PRIVATE RIGHT TO ACTION COMPONENT IN IT. CORRECT AND THEN JUST MIGHT MY LAST QUESTION MISTER CHAIR IS THE REASONING FOR CHOOSING A SUNSET DATE- IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HOW DO WE REACH THAT DATE THAT SOME FAR IN MY OPINION KIND OF FAR OUT THERE STRETCHING SO HOW DO WE RESET THERE HAS TO BE SOME LOGIC OR SOME SOME PREMISE AS TO HOW WE GOT TO THAT DATE. I THINK THAT IT PROVIDES- TIME FOR THE INDUSTRY TO RECOVER AND TRUMP IT'S OUR EMPLOYEES THE OPPORTUNITY WHO HAVE BEEN LAID OFF IN THIS IN THESE AND IN THIS INDUSTRY. THE ABILITY TO- RECOVER AS WELL AS THAT AS THE INDUSTRY RECOVERED THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE THEN OFFERED- POSITIONS BACK IN THEIR- PLACE OF WORK. IN THE DOCUMENTATION OF AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL- THAT WE'VE READ SB NINETY THREE THAT IT ONLY PERTAINS TO THOSE THAT WERE AFFECTED THROUGH COVERT NINETEEN. THAT'S RIGHT THE- EMERGENCY NEEDS TO BE CORPORATE- RELATED I THINK THE PRIOR VERSION WAS OPEN TO OTHER TYPES OF EMERGENCIES- BUT THIS IS A LAYOFF DUE TO SPECIFIC FACTORS RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN. IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROVING THAT AN EMPLOYEE WAS LAID OFF BASED ON COVERT NINETEEN. IS WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY THE EMPLOYEE OR THE EMPLOYER- I'M NOT TRYNA QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM DR FOR SPECIFICS. YES SO IF IT THE EMPLOYEE WAS NOT LAID OFF OLD TO COATED THEN THAT WOULD BE THE- EMPLOYER HERE SAID IN. RELATION SO. THE BURDEN WOULD BE TOO EMPLOYER TO. MAKE THEIR TROUBLING THIS CALDERON WHAT THE REASON WAS HELLO MISTER WALTER WHAT WILL YOU TURN OFF YOUR CAPS PERHAPS THE INTERNET WILL BE YES. WATER TO TRY TURNING OFF YOUR CAMERA BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO HEAR YOU BECAUSE YOUR CONNECTION IS POOR. I JUST. CLICK SO. GET OKAY IT'S THE WORST YOU CAN TERM DR DEMOCRATS. YEAH THAT THE THAT DIDN'T WORK. MR BALTER WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TURN BACK TO CAMERA BUT FOR SOME REASON IT DID YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION IS POOR FOR SOME REASON. NOT NOT NOT NOT. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GO AHEAD. I'M SORRY CAN YOU PLEASE. REPEAT THE LAST QUESTION TO GET. SO ARM. WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHO IDENTIFIES AN EMPLOYEE UNDER THE CLOVER NINETEEN TO GET TO THAT AT SUNSET DATA TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS THE VERY END OF THAT ON THE EMPLOYEE OR THE EMPLOYER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY UNDER THE SCOPE OF IT NINETEEN- SECTION HERE AND SB NINETY THREE AND MISTER CHAIR IT'S WITH JENNA- BACKING FOR FLUID SO MAYBE THERE COULD BE A EMAIL TO MY OFFICE ON CLARIFYING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ALSO. NORMALLY THE EMPLOYER HAS THE- BURDEN OF. MAKING D. R. THE INITIAL STATEMENT AS TO THE REASONS WHY THE EMPLOYEE WHILE I SLOW PLAYED ALL OF. AND INSURE THAT WOULD BE. THE FIRST ALL. I'M SITUATION AT ALL TO MIDDLE. LAKE IF THERE'S A DISPUTE IS GOING TO BE A. OUR INSURANCE THAT THE EMPLOYEE. YEAH I'M- HERE WOMAN TARA MACINNES SEARCHING WELL I'LL MAKE SURE TO GET THAT RESPONSE IN WRITING AND SEND IT TO YOU AS WELL TO CLARIFY FURTHER WHO HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU HAVE MISTER BALTAR'S CONNECTIONS VERY POOR SO- IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER IF YOU COULD HAVE SOMEONE ELSE ANSWER HIS HIS QUESTIONS THAT BE APPROPRIATE BUT- I THINK HAVING MR BALTER ASK ANY ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS THAT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL FOR THE HEARING. MYSTERON US THANK THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS I DO STILL UNDERSTAND THAT- THE DIFFERENCE IN SOME OF THESE BILLS TO- THAT IT ONLY APPLIES TO WORKERS LAID OFF DURING COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC- AND HAS NO EMPLOYEE RETENTION REQUIREMENTS ALSO ON THESE. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THOSE- ANSWERS TO OUR QUESTIONS AND. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU GONNA MISS BLOOM AND MISTER JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE- COMMENTS NOT QUESTIONS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO ADD THOSE COMMENTS AT THIS TIME ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU AND LET ME BEGIN- I. BY SAYING OUT I WANT TO ADDRESS- SPECIFICALLY SB EIGHTY FIVE. A SINCE I BECAME INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH- WITH WITH THAT- AT THE CONTENTS OF THAT BUILDER IN THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATING- THE PACKAGE. AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE ASSEMBLY WORKING GROUP. BUT MEMBERS WHO WERE AT THREE OF US. JIM WOOD AND LAURA FRIEDMAN OUR ASSEMBLY BUDGET STAFF THE SPEAKERS STAFF MY SENATE COUNTERPART SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI THE GOVERNOR. AND HIS STAFF. OF THIS TRULY IS A LANDMARK ACCOMPLISHMENT IN MY OPINION AND WHY DO I SAY THAT WELL. THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED- THIS KIND OF MONEY ON PREVENTION EFFORTS- AND THE- THAT THE BILL'S CALLED WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCY BUT WE REALLY SHOULD THINK OF THIS. AS PREDOMINATELY PREVENTION MONEY- LET ME GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF- WHY THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF- OF THIS IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING SPENT ON- EFFORTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT IS AND- S. B. EIGHTY FIVE. THIS YEAR IT'S FIVE HUNDRED AND IT'LL BE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION AND THAT'S JUST THE EARLY ACTION PART- THAT IS ALMOST SEVEN FOLD WHAT WE SPENT IN THAT WHAT WE'RE SPENDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR- THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ALREADY PROPOSED CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS IN THE JUNE BUDGET. AND ADD TO OUR- MOLD UP MUCH IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE- MOLDED THE EARLY ACTION PLAN BUT THAT EARLY ACTION PIECES THE OTHER THING THAT MAKES THIS SO IMPORTANT- WE ARE ALLOCATING MONEY TODAY. TO AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE AS WE SPEAK PLANNING HOW TO ROLL OUT THESE EFFORTS- IN ADVANCE AND AS FIRE SEASON IS BEGINNING. OF THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE AND IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT GIVEN- A WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WILDFIRE IN THE STATE- IT'S OUR IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED OVER AND OVER AGAIN- JUST HOW INTENSE. LAST YEAR'S FIRE SEASON WAS BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT- THE SEVERAL YEARS LEADING UP TO LAST YEAR EACH OF THOSE SEASONS WAS A RECORD BREAKING SEASON IT'S BEEN WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AND SO- THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MORE IMPORTANT TIME FOR US TO BEGIN DOING THIS WORK WE WILL NOT. LET ME REPEAT WE WILL NOT DO ALL THE PREVENTION WORK WE NEED TO DO- WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OR WITH A BILLION DOLLARS. THIS NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT OF AS THE BEGINNING OF AN ON GOING EFFORT AND TO GIVE YOU AGAIN AN IDEA THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE- WE SPEND. IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR WE SPENT ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. FIGHTING FIRES DURING THAT SUPPRESSION WORK- THAT IS SO IMPORTANT WE TAKE NOTHING AWAY FROM THAT- BY DOING THE PREVENTION WORK BUT HOPEFULLY BY SPENDING MONEY ON PREVENTION. WE WILL BE ABLE TO MITIGATE. THE NUMBER OF FIRES THERE WERE NINETY FOUR HUNDRED LAST YEAR. AT NOT ONLY THE NUMBER OF FIRES BUT THE EXTENT- TO WHICH THEY BURN. NOT A ROUTE A RECENT FEEL STUDY SHOWED THAT- CHAPARRAL WITH- HAS RECORD LOW MOISTURE VALUES IN APRIL AND LITTLE TO NO GROUP. NO GROWTH- WHEN THEY SHOULD BE BLOOMING RIGHT NOW. CHAPARRAL OR FLAMMABLE SHRUBS THERE FOUND ALL OVER THE STATE BUT THEY'RE PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WITH. RECORD LOW RANGE AND RECORD HEAT IT'S EXPECTED THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WILDFIRE SEASON COULD BE SEVERE- AGAIN SOMETHING THAT'S ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL THAT IS NOVEL AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE RECOGNIZE. IN THE BUDGET ACTION THE DIFFERENCES IN TERRAIN AND VEGETATION AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH PREVENTION OF SPECIFIC TO DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE. OF. M. DOUG- SO AGAIN ANOTHER REASON WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE STATE'S WILDFIRES SOURCES ARE AS DIVERSE AS THE STATE ITSELF. THE TO ANSWER- A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THE QUESTION FROM- OUR OUR COLLEAGUE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE- WE ARE FINDING TWELVE NEW CRUISE THROUGH THE- THE E. FUND THERE'S ALSO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE EARLY BUDGET ACTION FOR HAND CREWS. PEOPLE WHO WILL GO OUT AND ACTUALLY DO THIS VEGETATION WORK WITH THEIR HANDS AND HAND TOOLS- IN A YEAR WHERE WE ARE COMING OFF OF OUR MOST DEADLY FIRE SEASON FACED WITH DROUGHT LIKE CONDITIONS RECORD LOW RAINFALL RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES PLANTS AND TREES AROUND THE STATE ARE EXTREMELY STRESSED RIGHT NOW RESULTING IN DRIER AND MORE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS EARLIER THAN THE STATE HAS EVER SEEN THIS FUNDING COULD NOT COME AT A MORE CRUCIAL TIME AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS LIFESAVING. EARLY BUDGET ACTION. THANK YOU MISTER WE'RE GOING TO GO TO- MISTER JONES SAWYER IN THE MIDST RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MY COMMENT IS REALLY ON SB NINETY TWO AND HOPEFULLY TO SET SOME. SOME HOPEFULLY SOME GUIDELINES AND SOME HELP NOT ONLY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION BUT FOR THIS BODY OF MANY OF US HERE. ALL WERE NOT HERE WHEN IT AB ONE OH NINE REALIGNMENT WAS VOTED IN. BUT WHEN WE GOT ELECTED WE HEARD OF ALL THE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THAT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT. AND AS I SAID SINCE I'VE GOTTEN HERE. IT'S NEVER REALLY LEGISLATION THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS IMPLEMENTATION. AND WHAT IS WHAT IS PROBLEMATIC RIGHT NOW IS WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOWER LEVELS- WHETHER IT'S THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE GOING DOWNWARD RIGHT NOT EXISTING STRUCTURES THERE- WE NEED MORE. SPECIFICITY ON HOW THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED AND I THINK WHICH YOU WHICH YOU'RE FEELING NOT ONLY FROM PROBATION BUT YOU SHOULD BE FEELING SOME THANKS FROM THE COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT. WERE SOME SOME COUNTY OFFICES ARE PLANNING TO SEND THEM OUT TO HELP WITH THAT- WE NOT ONLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THAT IS. BUT ALSO THEY HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT A LOT OF OUR BILLS THAT WE DO AND- I LOVE WHAT WE DO UP HERE. BUT WE DON'T PUT ENOUGH. RESOURCES MONEY. AND JUST REALLY LAYING OUT HOW SOMETHING WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ONCE WE MAKE A DECISION. AND SO DID FOR EXAMPLE THE OFFICE OF USE AND COMMITTEE RESTORATION AND BUDGET SUB FIVE. OF THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT IT IN THE COMMITTED I SIT ON. UNDER A LOT OF MEMBERS THAT THEIR ON- BUT TO SOME FIVE THE FELT THAT THE OFFICE MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THIS MAMMOTH UNDERTAKING. AND SO- MY SUGGESTION. AND I HELLO I'M WORKING WITH OTHERS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME. SOME SPECIFIC GUIDELINES ON HOW THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED. WITHOUT INTERFERING TOO MUCH WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY BUT MAKING SURE THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITY THEN COME BACK TO A YEAR FROM NOW. AND SAY THAT THEY DO THEY WERE UNDER RESOURCE UNDER FUNDED OR THEY DIDN'T GET ENOUGH DIRECTION. FROM THIS BODY ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE- THE DJJ OF REALIGNMENT AND SO- WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE AND WE NEED TO GET SOME ANSWERS FOR REALLY QUICKLY. I THINK YOU CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE WE BUT NOT THE BUDGET. BUT IT IS VITALLY VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT ALL SIDES SIT DOWN AND HAVE A REAL TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL. THANK THANK YOU LET'S GO TO- THIS RUBIO THE DOCTOR REMEMBER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON SO I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP HAS A QUESTION ABOUT THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS BEEN SPENT CAN YOU TALK. A HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED YET. DO YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION YET. I ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR THE ACTUAL AMOUNT THAT REMAINS BUT I WANTED TO CLARIFY AND CONFIRM THAT SB ONE HUNDRED ONE ONE FIVE FROM LAST AUGUST DID APPROPRIATE SIX MILLION FOR DIR TO ENFORCE BROADLY ANTI RETALIATION PROTECTIONS EMPLOYMENT MATTERS RELATED TO EMPLOYERS RE OPENING OR RESUMPTION OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS DURING OR AFTER THE CODE NINETEEN STATE OF EMERGENCY. AS WELL AS WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY PRODUK PROTECTIONS- THIS COULD HAVE INCLUDED- ENFORCEMENT OF PROTECTIONS TO ASSIST HOSPITALITY WORKERS IN RETURNING TO WORK ON BUT WAS NOT SOLELY FOR THAT PURPOSE AND SO- MY COMMENT EARLIER ABOUT THE SIX MILLION BEING FOR RECALL FOR HOSPITALITY WORKERS- WAS CORRECT IN THAT THE SIX MILLION WAS FOR SOMETHING BROADER- THIS WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION THAT IS SPECIFIC TO DIR FOR MEANT FOR-% RIGHT TO RETURN TO WORK- BUT STILL. I WOULD STILL GET THAT NUMBER FOR YOU- BUT THAT'S A CONFIRMATION OF THE SIX MILLION ALLOCATION THAT WITH MORE BROADLY- PROVIDED TO D. ACT WAS PROVIDED FOR THE AYE OFFER BROAD. ENFORCEMENT THANK YOU BYE I'M ARE THE QUESTION OF THE WEEK THEY NOT TOLD THAT THIS BILL WAS IMPORTANT TODAY BECAUSE WE SPENT WE HAVE THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT ON POLICY YOU'RE CONTRADICTING THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THAT MONEY WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT AND IF THAT'S THE CASE. THEN WHY THE RUSH ON THIS- BILL IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE- THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO- IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. AND WERE EXPECTED TO VOTE ON IT TODAY THEN THAT MEANS THAT EVEN IF YOU IF THE- BUDGET COMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE THE PER THE CORRECT ANSWER IS HOW ARE WE EXPECTED TO VET. BILLS BEFORE ONE PM TO BE VOTED ON AT THE ARE BUDGET COMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE THOSE ANSWERS. THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE. EARLIER THAT THIS BILL CHANGES THE LABOR CODE- AND- FOR THE QUESTION IS IF IT CHANGES THE LABOR CODE DOES THAT EXPIRE. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AS WELL AS WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING TO. TO YOU TOLD US RIGHT NOW AT THIS BILL EXPIRING TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. DALY BY MICHELLE R. YES YOU'RE ACTUALLY CORRECT I WILL GET YOU GET THAT ANSWER IN REGARDS TO SIX MILLION I JUST DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE- AN INCORRECT ANSWER AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU- BEFORE. ONE O'CLOCK. BUT THAT'S THE POINT TO THE IS THAT IF YOU'RE HAVING TO SCRAMBLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE IS. I EXPECTED OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO BE PREPARED IF YOU THE BUDGET COMMITTEES NOT PREPARED HOW DO WE EXPECT ALL OF US. TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE BILLS IF OUR OWN BUDGET COMMITTEE IS NOT PREPARED TO HAVE THOSE ANSWERS. AND AGAIN THE QUESTION ABOUT THE LABOR CODE IS BACK GOING TO EXPIRE ALSO SENSITIVE. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. BUT LABOR CODE CHAIN. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL- IN REGARDS TO THE RE HIRE WILL EXPIRE AT THE END- AND I AM NOT SURE IF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE I. R. IS ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT EITHER- VIET VIA EMAIL- WHICH IS ONE WAY THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE AND- HE WAS HAVING DIFFICULTIES- BUT- THE QUESTION WAS IN REGARDS TO WHETHER THE PROVISIONS OF THE LABOR CODE WOULD EXPIRE WITH THE SUNSET DATE. AM I WAITING FOR ARE WE WAITING FOR AN ANSWER FOR THAT. YES I AM. I THINK THERE'S A COMMUNICATION INTERNET ISSUES SO I'M I'M WAITING FOR A RESPONSE. OKAY WELL I WILL SHARE THAT WITH YOU AS SOON AS I GET IT. AND SO OKAY SO THEN I'LL FOLLOW UP AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL- BECAUSE OF THE COLDA PANDEMIC WE'VE BEEN VOTING ON BILLS. ARE THE LAST MONTH- LAST YEAR THAT WERE ALL COVERT RELATED AND MOST OF THEM HAVE EXPIRATION DATES OF ADS. BY THE END OF THIS YEAR SOME OF THEM SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ONE IS STILL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IN FOR USING COVERT AS AN EXCUSE- FOR THIS BY THE BILL TO BE INSERTED TODAY. IF IT'S ABOUT KOBE I WOULD EXPECT I WOULD HOPE THAT ALL OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT WE PASSED SO FAR THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED RELATED TO HAVE EXPIRATION DATES. OF AT LEAST THAT SOMETIME THIS YEAR AND THIS ONE IS NOT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO GOES BACK TO THE QUESTION AGAIN ABOUT IS THIS THE PROPER- WAY TO IMPLEMENT THIS KIND OF POLICY IF THIS EXPLORATION. IS NOT TILL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THEN I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GET IT THROUGH THE REGULAR PROCESS IT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME THAT THE BILLS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT ARE PUT INTO THE BUDGET PROCESS WITH TWO DAYS OF NOTICE TO US. WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO EITHER GET THE BUILDING CLEARLY YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME EITHER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW- FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE OUR CONSTITUENTS THE ONES THAT WE HAVE TRANSFERRED TO LIVE. AND THEN TO THE STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE THAT WOULD BE FOR DOING THE BEST- POLICY. CHANGES FOR OUR STATE THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT THAT THE POLL COMMITTEES A- FOR IT SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT RE. PUTTING A BILL OUT ON AGAIN DOESN'T GIVE US ANY TIME AND IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY TIME EITHER TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER A QUESTION SO- I JUST. IT'S FRUSTRATING OBVIOUSLY THAT WERE BEING PUT IN THE POSITION WHERE WE HAVE TO ANSWER TO OUR OWN CONSTITUENTS WITH LITTLE OR NO INFORMATION AND AGAIN WHEN I ASK THE QUESTIONS OF THE BUDGET. COMMITTEE I DON'T HAVE THOSE ANSWERS SO IF YOU'RE NOT FOR. HOW DO YOU EXPECT A TO BE PRE. TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER TO OUR SINCE THE- NOT ALL OF THE DISTRICTS ARE THE SAME. AND SO I WOULD LIKE THAT ANSWER AS TO WHAT IF ANY OF THE MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT. AND IF SO. IF WE DON'T HAVE GUIDANCE THAT I WAS TOLD THAT THAT WAS THE REASON WE'RE DOING THIS BILL IS FOR GUIDANCE FOR THOSE SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THEN HOW DO WE SPEND THAT MONEY WITHOUT ANY GUIDANCE WHAT FOR THE- ADDITIONAL QUESTION IS. IF WE SPENT MONEY WHAT DID WE SPEND IT ON AND WAS IT RELATED TO- SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL THAT WE'RE- BEING ASKED TO- LOOK AT TODAY. SERVICES TAKE A STAB AT THIS AS WELL. THIS REVIEW SO I THINK YOUR- YOUR- YOUR FRUSTRATION IS A VERY VALID. ON AGAIN THIS IS. MONEY THAT WAS APPROPRIATED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR ALTHOUGH IS FOR A BROADER PURPOSE. WE FELT THAT THIS IS A VERY NARROW SET OF WORKERS THESE ARE GET HOSPITALITY WORKERS- WE THOUGHT GIVEN HOW HARD HIT THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. THE LAWS OF THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE- TIME TO CLARIFY AGAIN. HI ALL SOME OF THE SIX BILLION DOLLARS AS OF THE READY APPROPRIATE IN THE BUDGET COULD BE USED IN AGAIN. WE APPROPRIATED AN ADDITIONAL SIX. MILLION DOLLARS FOR. SPECIFICALLY HOSPITALITY WORKERS- BUT MR TANK ABOUT THE QUESTIONS THAT. I ASKED YOU DIRECTLY OVER THE WEEKEND AND THAT'S THE SPECIFICALLY YOU ANSWERED. THAT THIS WAS BECAUSE OF THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THAT QUESTION A LOT YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID AS I SAID I HAVE THE TEXTURE HERE MISTER KING. THE ICE I SAID. IT IS PART OF THE SIX MILLION. I THOUGHT MISTER KING I THAT'S WHY I ASKED OVER THE WEEKEND AND YOU SAID SPECIFICALLY THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR PARTS ONE DOLLAR IS LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON THE POLICY. AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSION THIS YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO FIND AGREEMENT WITH THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR THAT TELLS ME ON THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR THE ORIGINAL SIX MILLION DOLLARS. YOU DIDN'T SAY GOING FORWARD. RIGHT SO THERE'S A THERE'S ANOTHER SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN HERE AS WELL IN ADDITION FOR MORE ENFORCEMENT. AND AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A VERY NARROW SET OF FOLKS FOR THE UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER KING BUT THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO BE PROACTIVE AND TEXT YOU OVER THE WEEKEND FOR THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THIS DEBATE ON THE FLOOR ANDERSON OVER. THE DIFFERENCES AND WHEN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE IS NOT PREPARED THEN THAT'S MORE FRUSTRATING BECAUSE NOW I'M EXPECTED TO ANSWER TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND I CAN'T EVEN GET STRAIGHT ANSWERS FROM THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ABOUT WHAT WE DID WITH THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS. OKAY WELL I FIGURED I- I THINK I'LL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER I DON'T KNOW. THE ANSWER MAY NOT. MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS BUT AGAIN THAT'S BUT THAT'S OUR ANSWER. OKAY LET'S GO TO- IF YOU'RE DONE THIS REVIEW THAT WE'RE GONNA GO DOCTOR REGULAR AND INTO MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M GOING TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS TODAY ON S. B. EIGHTY FIVE THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR AND FOLLOW UP WITH WHERE OUR SUB THREE CHAIR SPOKE ABOUT. THE INVESTMENTS IN WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCY. WHILE I AM PLEASED TO SEE THE BROAD INVESTMENT THAT WE ARE MAKING IN EFFECTIVE LAND MANAGEMENT I AM CONCERNED WITH THE A MISSION OF FUNDING FOR ALL CONSERVANCIES TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE FIRE PREVENTION. AND FUEL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. SPECIFICALLY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHY THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY WAS OMITTED DESPITE ITS PROXIMITY AN ONGOING FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. GOOD MORNING STEVEN BENSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IT'S SORT OUR- FOCUS WITH THE CONSERVANCY'S WAS ON- DEMONSTRATED PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY AND CAN OUR NEAR TERM- FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST RESILIENCE BENEFITS. AND SO WE HAVE FOCUSED DOLLARS IN A FEW CONSERVANCY IS THAT- BETWEEN JUST CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE- IDENTIFIED SOME SPECIFIC PROJECTS BUT- THE OTHER CONSERVANCY'S AREN'T EXACTLY LEFT OUT OF THIS IT'S THERE AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF GRANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE HISTORICALLY. USED BY NUMBER CONSERVANCY IS TO DO SEVERAL PROJECTS EFFECT ACTUALLY THE FRAMEWORK. UNDER FIRE ENGINE PACKAGES ACTUALLY TO USE THE- CONSERVATIONS REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY GRANT PROGRAM TO KIND OF BUILD UP. AND DEVELOP REGIONAL COLLABORATIONS AND STRATEGIC PLANS TO GET PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE AND SO THERE'S INVESTMENTS IN THAT PROGRAM TO HELP- ALL OF THE CONSERVANCY'S AND ALL OF THE LOCAL. ENTITIES TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON- ADDITIONAL REGIONAL PLANNING AND THEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT MONEY. IN THE FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAMS BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM- THAT ARE ALL ELIGIBLE FOR THESE UNCERTAINTIES AS WELL AS LOCAL ENTITIES TO COMPETE FOR AN TO DO THOSE PROJECTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER I'D I DO FEEL OBLIGED TO REMIND US THAT THE CREEK FIRE WHICH IS THE LARGEST FIRE WE'VE HAD IN OUR STATE HISTORY. BEGAN IN FRESNO COUNTY. AND MUCH OF THE PREVENTION WORK THAT WE ARE SPEAKING TO TODAY IS IN FUEL REDUCTION. AND THAT THERE ARE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS FOR US TO ADDRESS THE BEETLE KILLED. TREES THAT WE CAN HELP TO REDUCE AND I'M WONDERING. AND IT CAN BE A CONTINUED CONVERSATION BUT I DO FEEL LIKE REMINDING US THAT IT SEEMS WE CONTINUE TO FUND THE CONSERVANCY'S THAT ARE ON THE COAST. BUT WE LEAVE OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE ONES THAT STRUGGLE. TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE THEIR- WITH AND A- SHARE OF RESOURCES AND JUST WOULD ASK THAT WE CONTINUE TO REMEMBER THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY. AS THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING FORWARD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU DOCTOR AVAILABLE GO TO MR GALLAGHER IN THE MISCHIEVOUS. ALL RIGHT IT'LL BE NOBODY'S SURPRISE THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON WILDFIRE- AND SO. LET ME I WANT TO DIG THROUGH SOME OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HISTORY- WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE NINE OH ONE DEAL- WHICH WAS A SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT I THINK OF THIS LEGISLATURE- SENATOR DOLLY I KNOW PLAYED A VERY KEY ROLE- IN NEGOTIATING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FROM GIGI R. F. THAT WOULD BE PART OF THAT. OF THAT PACKAGE TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE DOING- NOT EVERYTHING BUT MAKING A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON THE MONEY GOING INTO- WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND FUELS REDUCTION- ONE THING IS MISSING FROM THIS PACKAGE IS THERE WAS A LOT OF REPUBLICAN INFLUENCE. ON NINE OH ONE AND AS FAR AS I KNOW NONE OF US WERE ASKED TO BE PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS PACKAGE AND I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC. ESPECIALLY ONE AS MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN BURNING DOWN. WE NEED TO BE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION GOING FORWARD AND I WAS MISSING AND I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM- ON THE NINE OH ONE DEAL IS SUPPOSED TO BE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. A YEAR- LAST YEAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE DID NOT GET THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION BECAUSE OF THE GDR OF FUND NOT THE OPTION NOT GENERATING ENOUGH MONEY. IS THAT CORRECT AND- WAS THAT MONEY MADE UP AT ALL IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. I'LL HAVE A QUESTION TO STEVEN BENSON. GOOD MORNING CEMEX GALLAGHER YES SO THIS PACKAGE INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND GIGI R. F. THAT IS TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE- PORTION OF THE TWENTY MILLION THAT WAS NOT ORIGINALLY INCLUDED. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. OKAY SO THAT MAKES UP FOR LAST YEAR OKAY. AND THEN DO WE DO THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S COMMITTED FOR THIS YEAR. YES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED THE G. G. R. F. TO TAKE PLACE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ACTUALLY PROPOSES TO CONTINUE DOING. THE L. S. B. NINE A ONE COMMITMENT FOR AN ADDITIONAL. FOUR FIVE YEARS BEYOND WHAT SB NINE A ONE. PROPOSED RIGHT BUT I WANT TO GET TO WHERE SO. THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MAKES UP FOR LAST YEAR. RIGHT AND THIS YEAR THERE'S A PROPOSAL FOR ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED MILLION OF GIGI R. F. RIGHT. YES OKAY SO THAT'S A- THAT'S THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. HOW DID THIS FIVE HUNDRED THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION THE JUST GETS US BACK TO STATUS QUO NINE OH ONE. RIGHT IF I COULD CLARIFY THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION THAT'S AN EARLY ACTION DOES NOT INCLUDE. BUDGET ALL FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN CURRENT YEAR WHICH IS TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO IT INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE THE GINGER OF COMMITMENT HOLE IN INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND- SB NINE A ONE COMMITMENTS IN FORCED PREVENT OUR FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST RESILIENCE OKAY ALL RIGHT. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT IS NOT ALL FUELS REDUCTION RIGHT. IT WON'T ALL BE FUELS REDUCTION THERE IS SOME THINGS IN THERE TO HELP DEVELOP THE FOR SECTOR AS AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS TYPE OF THINGS. BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING IS GOING TO FOREST HEALTH. AND FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS AS WELL AS REGIONAL FORCING FOR CAPACITY GRANTS THERE'S ALSO A- AT. HEARING ALL THAT TO SAY A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF THIS FIVE HUNDRED THE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST MAKES UP FOR WHAT WE DIDN'T DO LAST YEAR OKAY SO LET'S NOT ACT LIKE THAT'S ADDITIONAL THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND DIDN'T DO OKAY. SO THAT THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION TAKE THAT OUT OF TAKE THAT OUT OF THE PICTURE. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO ADDITIONAL. THERE'S TWO HUNDRED PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I UNDERSTAND THAT. AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL LET'S CALL IT. YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. NOT ALL OF IT IS GOING INTO FUELS REDUCTION. RIGHT NOT EVERY LAST PENNY IS IN FUEL REDUCTION RIGHT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO FUEL REDUCTION BUT THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS OF FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION BETTER NOT JUST FUELS REDUCTION RIGHT NOW AND SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO COMBINE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH THE EARLY ACTION THE EARLY ACTION INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION BEYOND THE SB NINE A ONE OUNCE AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THAT'S BEYOND JUST THE S. B. .ORG. SO BETWEEN EARLY ACTION AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE WOULD BE EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN FIRE PREVENT RIGHTLY AND YUKONERS OKAY BUT AGAIN YOU'RE OBFUSCATING BECAUSE OF A BIG CHUNK OF THAT MONEY IS NOT GOING INTO FUELS REDUCTION. IT'S GOING INTO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. AT FOR INSTANCE I MEAN I'LL GET TO THIS POINT YOU YOU ANNOUNCE YOU'RE HIRING A ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE. NEW FIREFIGHTERS TO SUPPRESS FIRE. IN ACTUALITY WE ALWAYS HIRE SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS. YOU'RE JUST DOING IT EARLIER IN TIME THIS YEAR. SO THOSE AREN'T NEW FIREFIGHTERS THAT YOU'RE BRINGING ON. THAT'S THE SAME FORCE THAT WE HAVE EVERY YEAR. CORRECT BUT YOU'RE JUST BRING IN AMMAN EARLIER IN TIME AND ANNOUNCING LIKE IT'S SOME ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. THAT WE DON'T HAVE EVERY YEAR RIGHT. NOT NOT QUITE- WE DO BRING ON SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND RECENT YEAR YEAH WE BRING ON SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS EVERY YEAR. BUT WE ARE BRINGING ON MORE SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS THIS YEAR THAN WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY. RIGHT BUT YOU'RE INCLUDING IN THAT ACTING LIKE WHEN YOU ANNOUNCES YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE BRINGING ON MORE FIREFIGHTERS YOU KNOW ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE MORE FIREFIGHTERS AND WE EVER DO THAT'S NOT AN ACCURATE STATEMENT. WE ALWAYS HAVE BRING ON SEASONAL CREWS AS WE SHOULD. THE PROBLEM IS. THE PROBLEM IS THESE FIRE FIRE AND IF YOU TALK TO THE ACTUAL FIREFIGHTERS WHICH I DO. THEY THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THESE KIND OF FIRES. THEY'RE NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN SUPPRESS THEY HAVE THEIR SUCH CONFLAGRATIONS WITH THE AMOUNT OF FUEL. THAT WE HAVE THE FUELS BUILDUP THAT'S OCCURRED OVER DECADES. ISN'T IT THEY QUICKLY BECOME LIFESAVING MISSIONS ONLY. NOT FIRE SUPPRESSION BECAUSE YOU YOU LITERALLY CAN'T GET IN FRONT OF THEM. YOU LITERALLY CAN'T STOP THEM. BECAUSE OF THE FUELS ISSUE AND SO WE NEED TO BE PUTTING THE FOCUS ON FUELS NOW LET'S NOT DISCUSSION. SO YOU HAVE. 20% OF THE MONEY BY MY CALCULATIONS GOES TO CONSERVANCIES. AND PARKS AND STATE OWNED LANDS BUT WE ALWAYS SAY IT'S NOT REALLY THE STATE ON LANDS THE PROBLEM IS THE FEDERAL LAND. LIKE WHERE THEY CAN'T FIRE STARTED FOR INSTANCE. LIKE WHERE THE BEAR FIRE STARTED ON FEDERAL LAND AND BURNED OUT THE COMMUNITY OF- AND SORRY BURNED OUT THE COMMUNITY A VERY CREEK THIS YEAR. THEY START ON FEDERAL LAND WE NEED TO BE DOING THE WORK OUT THERE ON FEDERAL LAND YET 20% OF THIS MONEY IS GOING TO CONSERVANCIES AND STATE OWNED LANDS. WHICH MAKE UP ABOUT 3% OF THE LAND MASS. THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT. SO WHY NOT BUILD ABILITIES MISTER GALLAGHER BUT THE STATE OWNED LANDS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS WHY WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO MANAGE THAT. IN THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING IS GOING TOWARD SUPPRESSION IS BECAUSE GOING TOWARD A NOT SUPPRESSION. BUT TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. 20% IS GOING TO STATE OWNED LANDS EVEN THOUGH THEY REPRESENT 3% OF THE PROBLEM AND WE JUST ANNOUNCED WE HAD A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. ABOUT THIS NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO A MILLION ACRES A YEAR. WHICH WE HAVE NOT MET. WE HAVE NOT MET A MILLION ACRES HERE THAT IS NOT TRUE. WE'RE NOT ON TRACK TO DO THAT AND YET WE'RE PROPOSING TO TAKE 20% OF THE MONEY HERE. AND FOCUS IT. AND AGAIN. I'M NOT SAYING THE CONSERVANCY'S DON'T DO WORK- FOR INSTANCE HERE IN ABOUT A CONSERVANCY HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS SPACE THAT'S WHY THEY ACTUALLY WERE. IN THE EARLIER PROPOSALS THEY- THEY WERE TARGETED WITH MONEY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN. MONEY GOT TARGETED ELSEWHERE THE PROBLEM IS THIS LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET DOESN'T SPECIFY THAT THOSE CONSERVANCY IS USE THE MONEY FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION OR SORRY FIRE PREVENTION OF FUELS REDUCTION THEY COULD USE THE MONEY TO GO BUY ADDITIONAL LAND OR BY ADDITIONAL EASEMENTS THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS LANGUAGE THE SAYS THEY CAN'T DO THAT. AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT MONEY'S GOING TO GO TO WHERE THE REAL PROBLEM IS. WHICH IS ON FEDERAL LANDS WHERE WE CONSTANTLY SAY THAT PEOPLE CONSTANTLY SAY THAT ALMOST A FEDERAL LANDS PROBLEM. WELL NOW WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE FEDS TO DO A MILLION ACRES A YEAR. AND WE HAVE MONEY THAT WE CAN INVEST IN IT LET'S TARGETED. TOWARDS WHERE THE REAL PROBLEM IS. WE'RE TALKING LIKE TEN FOOT TALL BRUSH PILES AND SOME OF THESE AREAS. YOU'RE NT GOING TO STOP THAT UNLESS YOU GET RID OF IT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT DROVE THE CAMPFIRE. THAT'S WHAT DROVE THE FIRE THAT WIPED OUT VERY VERY CREEK WE ACTUALLY THE FEDS LET THAT FIRE BURN. FOR WEEKS AND THEN IT TOOK OFF AND CAME THROUGH AND DESTROYED A WHOLE COMMUNITY. WHY ARE WE FOCUSING THIS MONEY ON THE PROBLEM THAT'S MY POINT. YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT MONEY TARGETED TOWARDS A FUELS REDUCTION PROJECTS THAT ACTUALLY STOP THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING TO THE TO THE HEART AND HE CORE OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON IT BUT NOW THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE WITH MONEY AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MONEY BE TARGETED TOWARDS THOSE PROJECTS AND I'LL LET. YOU KNOW MISTER BENSON RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR FEEDBACK BUT- I DON'T THINK THIS PACKAGE TARGETS THAT SUFFICIENTLY TOWARDS FUELS REDUCTION BUT I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT. THIS PACKAGE IS LARGELY ABOUT FUELS REDUCTION. WE'RE NOT FUNDING SPECIFIC PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LAND BECAUSE THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL LAND BUT WE AREDOING PARTNERSHIPS AND REGIONAL COLLABORATION THAT INCLUDES ALL LANDOWNERS. FEDERAL STATE PRIVATE AND WE'RE WORKING ON PROJECTS THAT ARE DEVELOPED WITH THOSE REGIONAL COLLABORATIONS WEBER THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING. AND HELP TO TAKE CARE OF LAND THAT IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER NO WE ALSO USED A BAR GRANTS TO TREAT THAT ONE LET ME CORRECT YOU ARE DOING THE GALLAGHER CAN LOOK AT CAN YOU LET THE GENERAL ANSWER HIS QUESTION YOU STARTING WITH YOUR QUESTION. YEAH I JUST BUT MR BENSON ISN'T IT TRUE MR GALLAGHER. HE IS DONE FINISH THE QUESTION HE FINISHED ANSWERING. GO AHEAD ASSEMBLY MEMBER YEAH SO. MY QUESTION THOUGH IT I MEAN YOU SAID THIS ISN'T GOING TOWARDS FEDERAL LAND ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT TRUE THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS THAT WE- THAT WE GIVE OUT AS A STATE THOSE CAN BE USED ON FEDERAL LAND. I'M SORRY IF THE LAST PART OF MY COMMENT DIDN'T COME THROUGH CLEARLY WHAT I WAS SAYING IS YES WE DO USE SOME OF OUR GRANT DOLLARS TO DO PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LAND. THAT IS CORRECT. RIGHT AND WE HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT MONIES IN THERE BUT I'M SAYING THAT'S THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED IN ON RIGHT NOW IT'S SEVENTY THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND. AND FIFTY MILLION GIGI R. F. IN THOSE WILDFIRE PREVENTION. GRANTS. BUT WE COULD FOCUS FOR INSTANCE THAT. THAT 20% IS NOW JUST FOCUSED ON. STATE LANDS WE COULD PULL MORE OF THAT MONEY INTO THE GRANT PROGRAM AND GET AND GET OUT MORE OF THESE PROJECTS CORRECT. SO BETWEEN FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS THOSE TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THERE IS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS BEING MADE AVAILABLE ALL OF THAT GOES TOWARDS FUEL REDUCTION. IN FORCE FOR SELF PROJECTS THAT HELP WITH YOUR REACTION. THE FORCE WILL PREVENTION GRANTS ARE MORE SPECIFIC TO FUELS BREAKS AND THOSE TYPES OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS. BUT FORCED HEALTH GRANTS ALSO HELPED MANAGE THE HEALTHY FOREST. WHICH HELPS TO MAKE BILL'S REDUCTION AS WELL. AND THERE'S ALSO A TEN MILLION DOLLAR SPECIFIC TO SMALL LANDOWNERS AND THERE'S FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE AND HAND CREWS THAT ARE ALSO ABOUT FUELS REDUCTION. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS IN HERE THAT ARE FOCUSED ON FUELS REDUCTION I WOULD SAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS EVEN THE STATE PROJECTS FOR PARKS AND FISH AND THE CONSERVANCIES ARE FOCUSED ON FUELS REDUCTION. AND FIRE PREVENTION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MY LAST QUESTION IS SO I JUST DECLARE I MEAN I THINK THAT WAS GOOD THAT SUMMED IT UP IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TOWARDS REAL FUELS REDUCTION. OUT OF THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK THAT WAS GOOD TO HIGHLIGHT. AND THEN. BUT YOU CAN PUT A LOT OF MONEY TO PROJECTS BUT WE NEED TO DO THE STREAMLINING OF SEQUEL- IN ORDER TO GET. OUT THESE PROJECTS THE ADMINISTRATION DID THIRTY FIVE. STREAMLINED PROJECTS THAT THAT I APPLAUD THEM ON. HOW MANY MORE ARE WE DOING. WITH THIS MONEY UNDER THAT SAME SEEK WAS STREAMLINING BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU DON'T REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS YOU COULD HAVE MONEY LIKE VERY CREEK DID THEY HAVE THE MONEY. TO DO FOR FUELS MANAGEMENT AROUND THE TOWN BUT THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH A FULL SEQUEL- REVIEW AND THEY WERE STOPPED HIM SHE WILL NOT WORK SO WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION DOING ARE WE DOING DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF PROJECTS UNDER THAT STREAMLINED METHOD. OR NOT. SO I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT DATE BUT RECENTLY THE CAL VTP THE CALIFORNIA- VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM. WAS APPROVED- WHICH ACTUALLY STREAMLINED SEQUEL FOR STATEWIDE FOR PROJECTS THAT FIT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THAT AND MOSTLY THESE FUELS REDUCTION AND FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS WILL FIT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE DOUBT BE COMPETE. SO THERE IS A BROAD STREAMLINED SEQUEL ALREADY IN PLACE- BASED ON THE COMPLETION OF THAT PLANT. HOW MANY PROJECTS. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED WITH THE GRANTS THAT WILL DEPEND ON THE GROUNDS THAT ARE PROPOSED ARE THE- PROPOSAL PROJECTS AND PROPOSED AND WHICH ONES GET AWARDED- AS WE NOTED. THAT A LARGE PORTION OF THIS MONEY IS IN COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS SO A LARGELY DEPEND ON WHICH PROJECTS PROPOSED NOTABLY GET AWARDED OBVIOUSLY IF THAT'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF- LARGE DOLLAR PROJECTS TO BE FEWER NUMBER PROJECTS IF IT'S- ON A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL DOLLAR PROJECTS THEN DIDN'T THE NUMBER PROJECTS WITH VERY. IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. THAT WILL BE GOOD I KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS WE DID THIRTY FIVE UNDER THAT STREAMLINED PROCESS- PROCESS- IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY MORE WE'RE GOING TO DO AND AS WE KNOW. THIS PROBLEM IS HUGE WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT IT WE HAVE TO DOUBLE DOWN. REALLY ON OUR EFFORTS PROBLEM IS I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE DOING THAT WITH THIS PACKAGE. PROCEDURE CONCERNS I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS PROBABLY MORE THAN DOUBLES DOWN ON THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL FIRE PREVENTION FUELS REDUCTION WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE STATE. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO MISS REVERSE AND TO MISTER SMITH NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND- COMMITTEE STAFFER YOUR WORK ON THESE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUDGET BILLS. ARE YOU KNOW I. I WANNA START OFF- BY MAKING COMMENTS ON S. B. EIGHTY FIVE IT ECHOING THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA I ARE BUDGET SUB THREE CHAIR MADE. ON THANKING THE TEAM THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS INCLUDING THE SENATE WORKING GROUP- A TEAM FROM THE ASSEMBLY. AND OF COURSE OF NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE STAFF WERE INVOLVED SO THANK YOU TO ALL THAT MADE THIS HAPPEN. AND ALL WITH A FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE- SPENDING MONEY OR EARLY ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION EARLY THIS YEAR AHEAD. OF THE WILDFIRE SEASON- I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ON. OF SB NINETY THREE AND THE RIGHT TO RETURN POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THAT BILL. I DON'T SEVERAL MEMBERS HAVE MADE. HAVE ASK QUESTIONS AND I HOPE THAT THEY GET ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS TODAY SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE THEIR DECISION. BUT I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT COVERT HAS ABSOLUTELY DISSEMINATED OUR HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. AND THEIR EMPLOYEES- IN AB I MEAN SB NINETY THREE CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK HAVE A PATHWAY BACK TO EMPLOYMENT. OF THIS BILL. IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BILL THAT WAS VETOED LAST YEAR INCLUDING. THE REMOVAL OF PRIVATE RIGHT TO ACTION THE INCLUSION OF A SUNSET DATE ON IT I THINK. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE ALREADY ALL VOTED FOR LAST YEAR. ON IT I HOPE THAT. YOU'LL JOIN ME IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- AS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I CAN SAY THAT THE MAJORITY. OF THESE WORKERS. IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY TEND TO BE PEOPLE OF COLOR- AND WE REALLY NEED TO TREAT THAT. WITH THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE- AFTER THIS CRISIS SO THANK YOU TO ALL. THANK YOU WILL GO TO MISTER SMITH AND THEN MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON IT IN REGARDS TO IT SB EIGHTY FIVE. ITEM NUMBER FIVE FIRE PREVENTION PROJECT PROJECTS. TEN MILLION DOLLARS I'D LIKE TO SEE THE LIST OF PROJECTS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT MIGHT BE ON THAT PROJECT LIST. IS THERE A PROJECT LIST. WHICH WHICH TO MENTAL APPROPRIATIONS REFERRING TO A CAMERA WITH WHICH TEN MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION ARE YOU REFERRING TO SIR MARCUS OF ITEM NUMBER FIVE. FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS SO FAR THANK YOU. ITEM NUMBER ONE SUB ITEM FIVE. YES SORRY I WAS LOOKING UP ON THE AGENDA- SO THAT IS THE FUNDING THAT WILL GO TO CAL FIRE UNITS FOR FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS I DON'T KNOW THAT THE EXACT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED YET SO EACH EACH CAL FIRE UNIT HAS A LIST OF PROJECTS AND IT MAINTAINS- FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES THEIR AREAS THAT ARE KIND OF HIGHEST PRIORITY- I THINK WHAT IS YET TO BE. DETERMINED AND I CAN CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP TO FIND OUT THERE'S MORE INFORMATION ON IS HOW MUCH OF THE TEN MILLION GO TO EACH-UNIT AND THEN YOU KNOW THOSE UNITS WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE AND WHAT PROJECTS IT WOULD FUND WITH THAT SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT LIST RIGHT NOW BUT WE CAN WE CAN CERTAINLY TALK TO FOLKS AND SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE OKAY AND PROBABLY COULD. EVEN ITEM NUMBER NINE IS FOUR POINT ONE MILLION FROM HOME HOME HARDENING. IN NUMBER ELEVEN TWO MILLION FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS. WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THEY NEED MORE MONEY. LIKE TO SEE A LIST OF PROJECTSTHAT THEY NEED DONE. SO MAYBE WE CAN FIND THEM. COME JUNE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS BUDGET. TO TRY TO GET THESE PROJECTS. OF FOR FIRE PREVENTION. WE'RE ALL WE ALL KNOW HOW BAD. IT IS IN THE STATE. WE KEEP PUTTING IT OFF WE NEED TO PUT THE MONEY. ON THE GROUND. FOR THESE RESOURCES TO TAKE AFFECT. THANK YOU- SB NINETY TWO- THE REALIGNMENT I UNDERSTAND THAT AND YOU SAID THERE WAS EVERYBODY WAS IN THE NEGOTIATION TO COULD YOU TALK TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY. DISTRICT COUNTIES TO FIND OUT WHAT THE RESOURCES WE KEEP PUSHING FUNDING FROM THE STATE DOWN TO THE COUNTIES. BUT THE MONEY DOESN'T COME WITH IT. AND HOWARD HILL SMALL COUNTIES GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER D. J. J'S PROGRAM THIS RUN SO GOOD IN THE STATE. THIS IS ALICE IN. OKAY GO AHEAD THEIR CAT I WAS JUST GONNA TURN IT TO ALISON I THINK YELTSIN. HI ALISON HEWITT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CERTAINLY I DID NOT TALK WITH ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES BUT WE TALKED WITH. THE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES- WHICH I BROADLY SPEAKING AND THAT IS KIND OF REPRESENTING COUNTY INTERESTED THEN WE TALKED WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FOLKS I SOME OF WHOM ARE INVOLVED IN THE ROLE COUNTIES. THERE ARE NONE AND IF STOCKTON FEEDBACK OR INTEGRATED HERE AND I WOULD ALSO SAY TO THE AMOUNT OF USE THAT ACCOUNTING HAS TO SERVE IT IS SOMEWHAT I'M DEPENDENT ON KIND OF THE YOUTH POPULATION THAT THEY HAVE- THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO DJ JERRY. AND THE OTHER TWO AND THEN THEY KEPT THE FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED WOULD GO TO ALL COUNTIES- DEPENDING DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF USE I'M- NOT THEY'LL SERVE A REAL LIFE YOU THAT THEY'LL SERVE IN THEIR CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT. THAT AND WHAT I SPEAK NINETY TWO SEEKS TO DO AGAIN AS I IT HAD- KIND OF NOTED EARLIER IS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COUNTIES TO CONTRACT WITH OTHER COUNTIES ARE POTENTIALLY OR TO USE. AND NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT COUNTIES WITH HOT A WITH THE HOPE THAT AND FOR EXAMPLE RURAL COUNTIES AND MAY ANT TO SEEK OUT AND SOME OTHER OPTIONS. AS OPPOSED TO- RIGHT IN THEIR OWN SANDEL PROGRAM THAT THEY MIGHT PARTNER OTHER CAN HAS I'M PRETTY. ROLE COUNT IS UNDER THAT THE IN OPTION THAT BE ABOUT. D. J. J'S PROBE IS JUST RUN FINE IN THIS. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED IT. BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA PUSH INTO THE COUNTIES AND THEY GOT A WHOLE START THOUGH WHAT I CALL THE START THE WHOLE WHEEL OF THE PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM. BUT I WON'T KEEP GOING TOO MUCH BUT MY BIG CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS. JUVENILE JUSTICE BUT YOU'RE GONNA BUT TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD. ADULTS WITH CHILDREN. AND I HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THAT PART OF IT. I'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO NINETY FOUR. BIT SB NINETY THREE BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING SHORT OF TIME WE'RE PROBABLY ALREADY OVER. ANOTHER ONE IS. CONCERNING FOR THE EMPLOYERS IN THIS STATE WE'RE TRYING TO OPEN UP THE STATE GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. BUT THE EMPLOYEE. THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. GET FIVE DAYS I GOT A CALL YOU. COULD BRING YOU BACK TO WORK. YOU HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO RESPOND I NEED SOMEBODY TO SHOW UP FOR WORK TOMORROW IN MY BUSINESS. THIS DOES NOT MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN THE STATE. THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM WE NEED TO GET THE STATE BACK OPEN. IT IF THEY'RE WILLING TO GO TO WORK. CHAU FILL OUT THE APPLICATION AND SHOW UP FOR WORK ME AS AN EMPLOYER. IS HINDERED ROUGHLY FORTY DAYS BEFORE I CAN HIRE. THAT EMPLOYEE BECAUSE I HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN ANSWER FOR MY PAST. EMPLOYEE AND I THINK THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM THIS BILL SHORTEN TIME THANK YOU. MAY I JUST CONFIRM THAT IT IS ACTUALLY- WITHIN FIVE BUSINESS DAYS THE EMPLOYER NEEDS TO NOTIFY AN EMPLOYEE AND THAT EMPLOYEE THAT HAS FIVE BUSINESS DAYS TO RESPOND SO IT'S ONLY THE TEN DAYS. WE JUST CONFIRMING THE TIME LINE OKAY. AND I HEARD ONE OF ONE OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES SPOKE OF THIRTY DAYS AFTER THAT TO THE STILL HAVE TIME WHERE'S THAT THIRTY DAYS IN THERE THEN. I BELIEVE THE EMPLOYER- MUST RESPOND WITHIN THIRTY DAYS IF THE POSITION WAS OFFERED TO ANOTHER EMPLOYEE THAT WAS NOT- LAID OFF. OKAY IN TEN DAYS BUT THEN I HAVE SOME OTHER NOTES THE OTHER BAD PART OF THIS. IF I DO HIRE SOMEONE. AND I DON'T SAY I DO IT ON DAY NINE BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM MY PREVIOUS EMPLOYEE. I'M GONNA BE FINED A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH EMPLOYEE. UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. BECAUSE I'M TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHORT OF ADHERED TO THIS LAW. I THINK IS BAD POLICY EXPRESSLY FOR THE BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU WILL GO TO MISTER BENNETT AND THEN TO MISS KOREA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR OF I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS MY COMMENTS- PRIMARILY TO SB EIGHTY FIVE THE WILDFIRE- BILLS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US- THIS IS A MAJOR EXPANSION OF OUR PREVENTION EFFORTS- AS A POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUE- FROM SANTA MONICA. AND BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW EFFORT- THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SIGNIFICANT LEARNING CURVE. WE HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF. PUTTING A LOT OF FOCUS ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION. AND AS AGAIN AS MY COLLEAGUE- POINTED OUT THE WE HAVE TREMENDOUS VARIETY AND VEGETATION GEOGRAPHY- AND CLIMATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT CREATES A WIDE VARIETY OF FIRE RISK- FROM BEETLE INFESTATIONS IN THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS- WHERE FIRES MAY COMMENT A WHOLE WALL OF FLAMES TO CHAPARRAL. OF FIRE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFONIA. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I ENCOURAGE US TO DEVELOP POLICIES TO CAPTURE LESSONS LEARNED THIS FIRST YEAR WE'RE GOING TO INVEST. A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS PERHAPS ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS LET'S GET THE LESSONS LEARNED LET'S LET'S LEARN HOW TO RANK PROJECTS WHICH TURNED OF VALUE WAIT. A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THESE PROJECTS- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER IDEA NEXT YEAR. WHAT ARE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE SHOULD MAKE ONE OF THE POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS WE COULD MAKE- WHICH THINGS UP MAKE THE MOST SENSE FROM A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT SECOND MY SECOND POINT IS THAT. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY SPOT FIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WERE THE PREDOMINANT WAY. THAT STRUCTURE WERE LOST. EXCUSE ME. THEY WERE THE PREDOMINANT WAY THAT STRUCTURES WERE LOST AND IT SEEMS THAT. THE SCIENCE AND THE THOUGHT GIVEN. TO HOW TO DEAL WITH SPOT FIRES- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED MORE OF BECAUSE THERE THAT DID DID THE RANDOM NATURE OF WHAT STRUCTURES WERE LOST X. CETERA SUGGEST IT'S NOT THE SAME AS A WALL OF FLAME- THAT WENT THROUGH PARADISE AND WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD FIRE PREVENTION TECHNOLOGY FOR BOTH OF THESE AND I JUST HOPE WE HAVE A HEALTHY RESPECT FOR HOW MUCH WE HAVE TO LEARN. IN THIS AREA TWO OTHER THINGS I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT HAS REACHED ALL THE COMMENTS HERE NUMBER ONE I WAS ELECTED BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THREE- HEARING- AT WE A WAS IDENTIFIED WANT TO- RESPOND MY COLLEAGUES- THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION IN THE NUMBER OF FIREFIGHTERS AS STAFF POINTED OUT HERE TODAY IT'S NOT JUST HIRING THE SEASONAL ONES WE HAVE NOW SOONER. BUT THERE IS ALSO ACTUAL BODIES MORE FIREFIGHTERS BEING HIRED WE SPECIFICALLY HAD- THE DATE ON THAT AND I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME BUT- THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION AND THEN- THE FINAL THING I HAVE IS A RELATED TO- THE QUESTION IS COMING UP ABOUT THE HOSPITALITY BILL AND I JUST LIKE TO HAVE SAFF CLARIFY BECAUSE I THINK I'VE HEARD. SOME CONFUSION HERE- THE- DAY. IS THIRTY DAYS A BUSINESS OWNER HAS TO RESPOND WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. IF THEY CHOSE NOT TO HIRE SOMEBODY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE QUALIFICATIONS AND THEY HIRED SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT. PERSON HAD THE QUALIFICATIONS YOU DON'T. GIVE THAT. IN THAT- NOT AS LIKELY. OR NOT A FREQUENT AS- THAT'S ONE THE EMPLOYEE HAS TO REACH. IN TELL EMPLOYEE THAT DIDN'T GET HIRED. THAT WHAT. WHAT WERE THE QUALIFICATIONS THE OTHER PER AND WHY YOU WEREN'T. STAFF FOR MY CORRECT IN THAT THE IT'S FOR ALL OF THEIR HIRING AND THAT THEY HAVE TO WAIT THIRTY DAYS COULD STAFF HELP ME WITH THAT PLEASE. THERE WAS A LOT TO DIGEST AND ALL OF THESE BILLS OVER THE WEEKEND. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY YOU ARE CORRECT ON THAT RIGHT SO WHEN WE HEAR THIS THIRTY DAYS THIS THIRTY DAYS IS NOT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE EMPLOYEES ARE GOING TO BE OFFERED THE JOB THEY'RE GONNA TAKE IT THEY'RE GOING TO BE OFFERED A JOB THEY'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT AND THEN IT'S THE NEXT EMPLOYEE AND ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES ARE TO BE NOTIFIED AT THE SAME TIME- TO TRY TO SPEED THIS ALONG STRONGLY NOTIFIED THAT YOUR SECOND LINE IF THIS PERSON DOESN'T TAKE IT YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT. BUT AND PLAYER DOES NOTHAVE TO WAIT THIRTY MORE DAYS BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY OFFER THE JOB SOMEBODY JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ONE FINAL TIME. CORRECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP ALL THESE VERY IMPORTANT OF PROPOSALS TO US TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK OUR BUDGET STAFF IN OUR LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THESE BUDGET TRAILER BILLS FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE THEM MOVE THEM FORWARD AND GET THEM TO THE GOVERNOR SAYS. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF DISNEYLAND RE OPENING ONE OF OUR STATE'S LARGEST EMPLOYERS I SAID TO RE OPEN AT A LIMITED CAPACITY I BELIEVE ON APRIL THIRTIETH I LOVE DISNEYLAND I THINK IT'S A MAGICAL PLACE BUT WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL AND MAGICAL ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE THAT BRING IT TO LIFE. AND WHAT I AM MOST EXCITED ABOUT IS OUR ABILITY IN THIS BODY TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THE NECESSARY POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT WORKERS THAT MAKE A PLACE LIKE THE THING LINE AND SO MANY OTHER SO MAGICAL ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO WORK SPECIFICALLY HOTEL WORKERS THAT HELPED CREATE THE WONDER THAT WE ALL LOVE SO MUCH. PUNISHER TWO THINGS RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN THAT'S A ISSUES ON UNEMPLOYMENT AS WELL AS COVER NINETEEN LIVES LOST A UCLA STUDY RELEASED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR SHOWS THAT LATINOS WORKING AS AN ESSENTIAL SECTORS HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN LATINOS ARE THE MAJORITY OF WORKERS WHO WORK IN THE FIELDS OF AGRICULTURE HOSPITALITY AND SANITATION WHAT THE LUXURY OF WORKING FOM HOME WAS NOT POSSIBLE AND THANKS TO THESE WORKERS. CALIFORNIANS WERE ABLE TO STAY HOME AND PEOPLE ACROSS OUR NATION HAD ACCESS TO PRODUCE GROWN IN OUR STATE OVERALL AT THE FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR NINETEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA LATINOS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES DUE TO COVER NINETEEN FAR MORE THAN ANY RACE OR ETHNICITY. IN OUR STATE WHEN IT COMES TO UNEMPLOYMENT CLOSE LOST DURING THE PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY WITH LATINO WORKERS BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED IN THE SECTOR NEARLY. SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND LAID OFF HOSPITALITY WORKER IS COULD RETURN TO. UNDER THIS BILL UNDER- SB NINETY THREE. AND BE ABLE TO FIND SOME SENSE OF NORMALCY AS WE CONTINUE TO SAFELY REOPEN OUR STATE AND AS WE CONTINUE TO CREATE PATHWAYS FOR BOOSTING OUR ECONOMY THE PROVISIONS. OF THIS BILL TO GIVE EMPLOYEES AT LEAST FIVE DAYS TO RESPONSE TO A RE HIRE OPPORTUNITY IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE REALITY THAT GIVEN COVERT NINETEEN AND A LOSS OF INCOME WORKERS MOVED LOST THEIR APARTMENTS. AND HAVE THEIR MAIL SENT TO A DIFFERENT ADDRESS TIME IS NEEDED TO INSURE ANY CORRESPONDENCE REACHES THE INDIVIDUAL AND THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REACH OUT AND HAVE THE APPROPRIATE RECORDS SB NINETY THREE OR AB EIGHTY FOUR ENSURE THAT WORKERS IN THE HOSPITALITY SPACE. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO WORK WITH THE JOBS THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY HAD THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY VOTED FOR A MUCH BROADER VERSION OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND IT'S NOW COMING BACK. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS WHILE IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE SEVERAL LOCAL CITIES HAVE ALREADY CREATED EVEN STRONGER ORDINANCES TO ENSURE THE HOSPITALITY WORKERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETURN TO WORK TO THEIR PREVIOUS JOB INCLUDING MY OWN CITY OF LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO SANTA CLARA. LONG BEACH AND PASADENA I WOULD SAY THAT- YESTERDAY I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE UNACCOMPANIED MINOR STAIN AT THE SAN DIEGO CONVENTION CENTER AND IN DOING SO I ALSO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO HOSPITALITY WORKERS AT THE HOTEL RIGHT NEXT DOOR. AND WHILE THE HOTELS ARE OPENING UP A SMALL CAPACITY THE WORK FORCE IS STILL NEEDED. AND IN FACT ONE LATINO WOMAN WHO I SPOKE TO SAID I FEEL LIKE I'M WORKING MUCH HARDER TWICE AS HARD BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE RETURNED TO WORK TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL THE DEMANDS OF THE HOTEL. THIS IS WHY WE NEED ALL WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK APPROPRIATELY WHEN IT IS SAFE- AND BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR JOBS BACK. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A HUGE HUGE CRISIS IN THE LAST YEAR A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WHERE OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. AND WE'RE MANY FAMILIES STUFF. IT IS NOT. OUR MOMENT OUR UPPER TO ENSURE THAT THIS LATEST BODY THAT THE STATE CALIFORNIA THAT GUY. OF STATE IS CREATING THE- NECESSARY TO ENSURE. THAT PEOPLE RETURN TO WORK. CAN HAVE A SENSE OF NORMALCY CAN RETURN TO THEIR JOBS. WITHOUT CREATING CABBIE OUGHT TO THAT THEY'RE NOT WORTHY ENOUGH OF COMING BACK TO WORK THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO ADDRESS WHEN IT COMES TO AGEISM. THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AND EMPLOYERS BEING ABLE TO RETURN BEING ABLE TO RE HIRE THOSE PEOPLE THAT THE WORKERS. THAT MAKE PLACES LIKE DISNEYLAND AND SO MANY OTHER OTHER SUCH AN INCREDIBLE A PLACE TO VISIT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. THIS IS A BUSINESS ABOUT PEOPLE. IT IS HOW DO WE PUT PEOPLE FIRST AND ENSURING THAT AMID ECONOMIC RECOVERIES POST COLD THE NINETEEN. WORKERS ARE THE FRONTLINE OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE UNDER REPRESENTED. AND OFTEN MARGINALIZED WORKERS WHO ARE OFTEN IGNORED THIS IS WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT WHY IT MATTERS AND WHY THE VALUES THAT ARE REFLECTED IN OUR BUDGET SAY A LOT MORE ABOUT. WHO WE ARE AND WHAT OUR GOAL IS. VERSUS WHAT WE ONLY SAY WE WANT WE CAN TALK ABOUT A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WE CAN REALLY ACTUALLY. ACHIEVE IT AND ACTUALLY CREATE A ROBUST. PEARL WORKER. ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN THAT ENSURES THAT WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN MOST MARGINALIZED AND VULNERABLE LIMIT THIS CALL BUT NINETEEN PACKED I MIGHT. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO WORK SAFELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CASING THEN WE WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE GALLERY. THANK YOU PLEASE RESTART.

GOOD AFTERNOON- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER PER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB NINETY THREE THAT WOULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDENS ON BUSINESSES IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY THAT HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. AS DISCUSSED AMONG THE MEMBERS A SIMILAR PROPOSAL WAS DEBATED AND DISCUSSED THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS LAST YEAR WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE BELIEVE SHOULD HAPPEN THIS YEAR THIS IS A POLICY CHANGE BEING PUSHED THE BUDGET PROCESS WHICH IS CONCERNING FROM A PROCEDURAL PERSPECTIVE. BUT ALSO FROM A TIMELY NOTICE PERSPECTIVE TO THOSE IMPACTED AS THEY WILL HAVE NO NOTICE OF THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY UPON SIGNATURE- AND THEY WOULD BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD. ON THE POLICY PERSPECTIVE WE AGREE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN LAID OFF FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN THE SHUTDOWN SHOULD BE RETIRED AND WILL BE REQUIRED IT'S COMMONSENSE FROM PLAYERS TO DO SO AS THEY ARE ALREADY TRAINED AND QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION BUT THIS BILL SEEKS TO MICROMANAGE HOW AN EMPLOYER RETIRED EMPLOYEES. SETTING UNREASONABLE TIME PERIODS TO OFFER EMPLOYMENT AND NOTICE REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN THE HIRING PROCESS INSTEAD OF IMPROVE IT AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE AND- APPRECIATE THAT SB NINETY THREE IS EXEMPED FROM LITIGATION UNDER THE LABOR CODE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT WE'RE STILL CONCERNED WITH THE MANDATORY ASSESSMENT OF PENALTIES ON EMPLOYERS WITH NO DISCRETION TO REDUCE THOSE PENALTIES. THIS SEEMS INCONSISTENT WITH MANY OF THE LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT HAVE ADOPTED. EXCUSE ME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ADOPTED LOCAL ORDINANCES AND INCLUDED A RIGHT TO CURE PROVISION FOR EMPLOYERS TO UTILIZE TO AVOID ANY PENALTIES ONE OTHER THING WE AGREE WITH THIS POSTON SAID INTO IS TO- SET AT TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- WHICH SEEMS MUCH FURTHER THAN NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC AND WOULD ENCOURAGE.
