REALLY START ARE STARTING TO SEEM LIKE INTEREST GROUPS. SPECIFICALLY PLANNED PARENTHOOD TRYING TO GET THEMSELVES ON A STUDENT ID.

AS PRESENTED YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND OTHERS. USE MAY SEEK OUT OUTLETS TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES THIS POTENTIALLY COULD PUT OUR LGBT YOUTH AT HARM SHOULD A PARENT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE REQUIRED OF ON PARENTAL CONSENT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN PRACTICE THERE ARE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT COULD GO ONLINE AND PROVIDE FICTITIOUS DATE OF BIRTH ON THESE PLATFORMS AS IT CURRENTLY IS IN EXISTENCE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THE TREVOR PROJECT HAS. REGISTERED OPPOSITION AS WELL AS THE INTERNET SO STATION CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TECHNET ALIKE SO RESPECTFULLY UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT ON PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN BUT AGAIN. I THINK THAT THERE CAN BE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERS OF THE LGB COMMUNITY AND OTHERWISE IN ACCESSING BASIC INFORMATION. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE SEEING IN HERE. MISTER CUNNINGHAM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE IN SUPPORT AS A CO AUTHOR THIS MEASURE TO ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING -- ANGLE WITH RESPECT TO THIS THIS ISSUE -- MANAGER FIRST NOTE LOOK AT AS A PARENT OF FOUR AND SOMEBODY WHO'S ABOUT TO HAVE. AN EIGHT YEAR TO I WILL HAVE THREE TEENAGERS IN MY HOUSEHOLD -- SO IN ADDITION TO YOUR PRAYERS I APPRECIATE. YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS THIS ARGUMENT -- THE INTENT OF THIS BILLS TO GIVE PARENTS A LITTLE MORE CONTROL AND THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION REPORTS THAT 70% 70% OF OUR KIDS. REPORT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BULLIED OR CYBER BULLIED ONLINE. AS AN ATTORNEY I'VE WORKED ON CASES WHERE KIDS WERE BULLIED OVER SNAPCHAT AND THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY EVEN HAD AN ACCOUNT. THEY WERE BULLIED SO BAD THAT THEY HAD TO LEAVE A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND GO TO ANOTHER SCHOOL I MEAN THIS IS REAL IT'S GOING ON IT'S AFFECTING ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. TO GIVE PARENTS A LITTLE MORE CONTROL. OVER WHAT'S GOING ON THERE HOUSEHOLDS WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE DOING THIS DOESN'T PREVENT ANY MINOR FROM HAVING AN ACCOUNT. IT SIMPLY SAYS PARENTS NEED TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION WITH THEIR KIDS. AND IT ONLY APPLIES TO KIDS -- THIRTEEN AND UNDER BEFORE THEY SIGN UP FOR SNAPCHAT OR FACEBOOK OR INSTAGRAM OR WHATEVER NEW THING COMES OUT NEXT YEAR. AND SUBJECT THEMSELVES POSSIBLY TO THE TO CYBER BALLING THAT'S GOING ON EVERY DAY. IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM MISTER GLORIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I JUST RISE TO A ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM CAMPBELL WITH A TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORACLE TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE SITUATION AND ASK MEMBERS TO PUT YOURSELF. IN MY COLLEAGUE AND I SHOES YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE WERE NOT ABLE TO DIRECTLY TO ADDRESS WHO AND WHAT WE ARE TO OUR PARENTS. I'M NOT BECOMES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS ONES THAT WOULD BE MANDATED UNDER THIS LAW. I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO KEEP OUR KIDS SAFE BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT DOESN'T WORK IS ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL AND THERE'S A SITUATION AND OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE TODAY ALL THESE YEARS LATER. ALL THESE YEARS LATER THIS IS STILL A PARTICULAR PROBLEM SO I'D ASK YOU TO BE THOUGHTFUL WITH YOUR VOTES TODAY I RECOGNIZE THE THE WHEEL -- WORDS OF CAUTION FROM QUALITY CALIFORNIA AND THE TREVOR PROJECT WE KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE -- ARE OFTEN -- PREYED UPON ONLINE BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THE ONLINE MAY BE THE ONLY ACCESS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A TWO EIGHT IMPORTANT INFORMATION THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE THEM AND GIVE THEM A SAFE SPACE TO OPERATE IN THE WORLD. I ASK YOU THINK VERY LONG AND HARD ABOUT YOUR VOTE TODAY AND RECOGNIZE THAT MAYBE THERE'S NEEDS FOR MORE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE CHILDREN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HAVE A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE THEMSELVES WITHOUT DISCLOSING WHO THEY ARE TO THEIR PARENTS BEFORE THEY ARE READY IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO MEMBERS BILLS VIEW COMMUNITY ASK YOU THINK ABOUT THIS VOTE. AFTER THIS MORNING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SIR CAN I JUST HAVE A QUESTION OF THE OTHER WHICH YOU COULD USE ANSWER NOW YOU COULD USE ANSWERING YOUR CLOTHES. IT IS ACTION. HOW CAN YOU VERIFY THAT THE PARENT HAS ACTUALLY GIVEN CONSENT -- AND I THINK I MENTIONED THIS IN COMMITTEE IT TOOK ALL OF THREE MINUTES FOR MY BROTHER AND I WHEN WE WERE YOUNG TO FIGURE OUT THE CODE THAT MY DAD PUT ON THE TV. SO THAT WE COULD WATCH MOVIES THAT WERE P. G. THIRTEEN OR HIGHER -- AND AND SO KIDS ARE PRETTY CLEVER OF BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO GET AROUND DIFFERENT PARENTAL CONSENT SO UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO ASK THE PARENT TO PROVIDE. PICTURE ID OR I I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT HOW YOU ENVISION. THESE PLATFORMS TO VERIFY THAT THE PARENTS ARE ACTUALLY GIVING THAT CONSENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE -- AND THEN THE CONSIDERATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO GIVEN THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT WE'RE ASKING THESE PLATFORMS AND NOW COLLECT. AND STORE AND YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE HACKED IN THAT INFORMATION CAN BE COMPROMISED AT SOME POINT TIME SO AT SOME POINT TIME YOU COULD JUST ANSWER -- HOW THAT IS GOING TO WORK ON APPRECIATE IT? THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE MR GALLAGHER. YOU WHILE YOU MAY CLOSE. YEAH MANAGE FIGURE IF I COULD JUST CLOSE -- COUPLE THINGS ARE BROUGHT UP YOU KNOW ONE ONE THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TO SEE JUST TWO STORIES -- QUICK STORIES THEY KIND OF WERE A MOTIVATION FOR ME ONE I HEARD FROM A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER IN RED BLUFF -- WHO EVERY DAY IS INTERACTING WITH KIDS ON CAMPUS -- AND HE SAID YOU KNOW SHE TOLD THIS WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE SHE GOES YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET WHEN OUR KIDS TURNED SIXTEEN AGAIN THE KEYS IN THE CAR. AND THEY HAVE FREE REIGN TO GO AROUND THE REGION. IN THEIR AND THEIR CAR RIGHT. ANDSHE GOES BUT WE GIVE OUR KIDS A PHONE. AND WE GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE WORLD. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED INCH AND HER POINT WAS HEY JUST LIKE WHEN WE GET THE KIDS THE KEYS THE CAR WE GIVE THEM INSTRUCTION WE WORK WITH THEM WE TRY AND MAKE SURE THEY CAN BE SAFE. WE NEED TO DO THE SAME THING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPOSED TO A WHOLE BROADER RANGE IN THERE. AND THOUGH I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED -- HERE ON THIS FLOOR. OVERWHELMINGLY WHAT KIDS ARE EXPERIENCING A CYBER BULLYING WE HAVE SEXUAL PREDATORS THAT ARE THAT ARE GOING ONLINE AND TRYING TO LURE KIDS WE HAVE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS THAT ARE USING THIS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENCOURAGE THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN KIDS. AND THEIR PARENTS. AND I'LL GIVE YOU A MORE PERSONAL STORY I TALKED TO MY OWN DAUGHTER AS A HEY YOU KNOW YOU'RE PLAYING THESE GAMES. THEY EVER ASK YOUR AGE -- YEAH ALL THE TIME. I SAY WELL WHAT DO YOU SAY -- OTTOMAN. TWENTY FOUR YEAH AND AND FOR SO THAT WAS A WAKE UP MOMENT FOR ME LIKE HEY YOU KNOW I I NEED TO DO THIS. MYSELF THIS LEGISLATION ENCOURAGES THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION. AND AS FAR AS WHAT WILL THE WHAT WHAT CAN THE TECH COMPANIES DO TO ADDRESS THIS THEY ALREADY ARE. AND MANY KIDS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WOULD JUL WHO SELLS YOU KNOW VAPING. PRODUCTS ONLINE THEY HAVE TO VERIFY. THE PEOPLE ARE OF IT OF AGE TO HAVE. THAT -- INTO TO BUY THAT PRODUCT. SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES CAN CERTAINLY DO THE SAME THING AND HELP VERIFY THAT A CHILD IS OF AGE THAT THERE IS PARENTAL. CONSENT HERE AND SO LOOK I THINK THE OVERWHELMING. THERE ARE CERTAINLY RESOURCES OUT THERE THEY CAN HELP -- THEY CAN HELP ALL OF ALL PEOPLE YOU KNOW -- SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT THE ONLY OUTLET. FOR PEOPLE GO I I WOULD HOPE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA. IS NOT THE ONLY OUTLET FOR OUR USE THIS IS REALLY ABOUT. ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH OUR WITH OUR CHILDREN THAT WE HELP BETTER PROTECT. MINERS FROM THE VERY ABUSIVE PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW ARE HAPPENING ONLINE SO I WOULD I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU. TO HELP SUPPORT THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT WE DID AMENDED TO THIRTEEN YEARS OLD. WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW AND THAT DID NEUTRALIZE ALL OPPOSITION -- SO THERE IS NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- THE OPPOSITION WAS REGISTERED IN COMMITTEE MOVED TO NEUTRAL UPON THAT AMENDMENT SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE.
