BUT- PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. THE MICROPHONE PLEASE. YEAH- SO WE GOT TO THE PODIUM NHÃ . THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I'VE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MY LEGISLATIVE CAREER FIGHTING TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. TOO OFTEN OUR GOOD INTENTIONS IN SACRAMENTO DO NOT TRANSLATE TO IMPROVED HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES ON THE GROUND. FOR EXAMPLE WHILE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY IMPROVED COVERAGE. THAT COVERAGE IS NOT ALWAYS TRANSLATE TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE. THE LONGSTANDING PROVIDER SHORTAGE OF RURAL CALIFORNIA MEANS THAT MY CONSTITUENTS OFTEN GAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE BUT THEN STRUGGLE TO FIND A DOCTOR WHO IS ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS AND IS WILLING TO TAKE THEIR INSURANCE. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES THE STATE HAS CREATED AND FUNDED SEVERAL DIFFERENT HEALTHCARE PROVIDER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO DRIVE MORE PHYSICIANS DENTISTS AND OTHERS TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. IN THE MOST UNDERSERVED PARTS OF THE STATE. MOST RECENTLY THE LEGISLATURE IS UTILIZED SOME OF THE PROP FIFTY SIX TOBACCO TAX TO FUND A NEW LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. THE STATE AUDITOR RELEASED AN AUDIT OF THIS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM IN JANUARY AND FOUND THAT THE SCORING CRITERIA USED TO JUDGE APPLICANTS DID NOT REQUIRE THEM TO BE LOCATED IN AREAS. WITH A SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. AND S A RESULT OF THAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN SELECTED FOR LOAN FORGIVENESS WERE NOT LOCATED IN A SHORTAGE AREA. THE OTHER DETERMINE THAT THE PROGRAM COULD BETTER ADDRESS GEOGRAPHIC GEORGE'S BY REQUIRING APPLICANTS TO PRACTICE IN HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS. AND RECOMMENDED THE PROGRAM APPLICATION BE MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH ADMINISTERS A LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM DECLINED TO MAKE THIS REFORM. WHICH IS WHY I INTRODUCED THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. AS A FORMER CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND I THINK THE CURRENT YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS. FOR PARTNERING WITH ME AS A JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS BILL WHICH SIMPLY PROPOSED TO CODIFY THE AUDIT'S RECOMMENDATIONS. SINCE INTRODUCTION I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HEALTH CARE SPACE TO EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT USING HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS. AS THE SOLE METRIC TO JUDGE A PROVIDER SHORTAGE. THEY HAVE REQUESTED A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS ALLOW OTHER VARIABLES TO DEMONSTRATE PROVIDER SHORTAGES SO LONG AS THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION EMPIRICALLY QUANTIFIES THE NEED. HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS STORAGE AREAS ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO MEASURE SHORTAGES OF PRIMARY CARE DENTAL MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. AND SO MAY NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION CERTAIN SPECIALTIES WHICH ARE BADLY NEEDED TO SERVE OUR MEDICARE POPULATION. AS A RESULT I HAVE AGREED TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE METRICS BY WHICH AN APPLICANT CAN DEMONSTRATE THEY ARE IMPROVING ACCESS FOR UNDERSERVED MEDICARE POPULATIONS. INCLUDING CITING NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS PROVIDER TO BENEFICIARY RATIOS ALTERNATE ACCESS REQUESTS AND OTHER QUANTIFIED DATA SETS. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO ENSURE FUNDING FLOWS TO PROVIDERS THAT ARE SERVING THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED AND I BELIEVE THESE AMENDMENTS MAINTAIN THAT GOAL WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING NEED IS NOT A ONE SIZE. FITS ALL METRIC. CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS WILL CONTINUE AFTER TODAY'S HEARINGS IS THERE REMAIN A HANDFUL OF AMENDMENTS REQUEST WE'VE NOT QUITE SETTLED ON. THESE PRIMARILY RELATE TO SMOOTH THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM ONCE THIS BILL GOES INTO LAW. IT IS CERTAINLY MY GOAL TO MINIMIZE DISRUPTIONS TO EXISTING OPERATIONS SO I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN FIND A SOLUTION. TO THESE FINAL FEW ISSUES. ALL AND BY JUST THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR FACILITATING A PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON AB EIGHT EIGHT TWO TODAY. I HAVE WITH ME SIR BRIDGE WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS- ON THE PHONE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER GRAY- GO TO OUR OPERATOR IN PLEASE- ALLOW OUR WITNESS TO. TESTIFY OR IF THEY'RE COMING ON THE SCREEN I'M NOT REALLY SURE. YEAH HI THERE I'M ON THE LINE GREAT THANK YOU.OKAY GREAT AND I THINK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS THEIR BRIDGE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICT. ACROSS THE BORDERS OF ASSEMBLY BILL ECH YOU HEALTHCARE DISTRICT ESPECIALLY THOSE LOCATED IN RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE EXTREME DIFFICULTY RECRUITING AND RETAINING PHYSICIANS. AND SERVE LARGE PORTIONS OF THE STATE MEDICAL POPULATIONS AT THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT AND FUTURE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES OF PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS. LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS A TABLET PROPER FIFTY SIX SENATE. POSITIONS UNDER SIR COMMUNITY ARE ESSENTIAL TO DELIVER PRIMARY CARE TO BE THERE. HOWEVER EARLY TIS YEAR THE STATE AUDITOR FOR THAT THE COLLECTION IN THE MINISTRY OF THE PROPERTY SIX BY. DID NOT HAVE THE THING TO ENSURE THEY WERE APPROPRIATE AWARDED TO FINISH AND- LEVINE SHORT AREA. EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHT TWO PLACE MATHIS GUARD ON POSITION AND THAT TOO ONE OR TWO PROGRAM AND MINUTES THROUGH PROPOSITIONS SIX FUND TO WE CLOSE THE PROVIDE GOT IN THE MOST.

INTERESTING START TO MY DOCUMENTARY HERE- DR ARAMBULA YOU HAVE TO BILLS BEFORE US- PLEASE START WITH AB THREE FORTY SEVEN. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD END MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ON AB THREE FORTY SEVEN REGARDING MUTILATION UTILIZED STATION MANAGEMENT REFORM. UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS INCLUDE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND STEP THERAPY. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS A PROCESS IN WHICH PHYSICIANS MUST FILL OUT PAPERWORK WHENEVER THEY PRESCRIBE A SPECIALTY MEDICATION OR TREATMENT THAT IS RESTRICTED. STEP THERAPY IS THE PROCESS WHEREBY PAYERS FREQUENTLY DENY COVERAGE OF PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE MEDICATIONS. THIS PROCESS FORCES PATIENTS TO FAIL FIRST ON ALTERNATIVE MEDICATIONS BEFORE THEY ARE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN THE MEDICATION DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE PRESCRIBING PROVIDER. BOTH PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND STEP THERAPY ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS. WHILE REDUCING COSTS IS IMPORTANT ACROSS THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM MAKING MEDICAL DECISIONS. BASED SOLELY ON COST CAN LEAD TO AN ERROR YEAR REVERSIBLE DETERIORATION OF A PATIENT'S CONDITION. PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS OFTEN EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES WITH THE STEP THERAPY PROCESS SUCH AS DELAYS IN A PATIENT'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN MEDICATIONS. SPECIFICALLY AB THREE FORTY SEVEN EXPANDS PATIENT ACCESS AND IMPROVES UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS BY FIRST CREATING STANDARD EXCEPTIONS TO STEP THERAPY TO BE USED BY ALL PAYERS. IT ALSO REQUIRES CLINICAL PEER TO PEER REVIEW APPEALS BY A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL IN THE SAME PROFESSION OR SIMILAR SPECIALTY AS THE DOCTOR WHO TYPICALLY MANAGES THE MEDICAL CONDITION PROCEDURES OR TREATMENT WHICH IS UNDER REVIEW. IT ALSO REQUIRES A PAIR TO SEND AN APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF A STEP THERAPY EXCEPTION REQUEST OR A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUEST RATHER THAN JUST SUBMITTING A RESPONSE. WITHIN SPECIFIED TIME FRAMES. IT ALSO WILL TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING REQUIRING PLAYERS TO ANNUALLY REPORT INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF STEP THERAPY AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS AND DENIALS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. THIS BILL AIMS TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN ALLOWING PLAYERS TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE STEP THERAPY AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION WHILE ESTABLISHING GUARDRAILS TO PROTECT PATIENTS IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OR STEP THERAPY PROTOCOLS RATHER IT ESTABLISHES A STANDARD AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TESTIFYING BY PHONE WE HAVE CHLOE HUBBARD WHO IS AN MS PATIENT FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR PATIENT ACCESS AS WELL AS DR SAMI MATATUS RHEUMATOLOGIST FROM SAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY ALLIANCE.

WHICH IS WORKING WELL AND HAD NO SIDE EFFECTS. MY DOCTOR SAID THE DRIVE I WAS ASKED TO TRY WOULD NOT WORK. IN A LETTER TO THE INSURANCE STATED. THEY ARE INFERIOR AND ADVOCACY AND THAT THAT THAT THE PATIENT AT RISK OF PERMANENT NEUROLOGIC DEFICIT AND DISABILITY I HAVE A GREATER SIDE EFFECT PROFILE INCLUDING DEATH. I HAD TO WAIT TWO WEEKS AFTER WE APPEALED THE FIRST NILE AND THEY SAID THEY NEEDED ANOTHER. FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN TO DATE OR TIME. WE ASK FOR AN EXPEDITED RUBIO AND GREAT NIGHT. I WAS INTERVIEWED BY AN EMPLOYEE AT THE INSURANCE COMPANY NOT A DOCTOR WHO ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE IF I DIDN'T GET THE MEDICATION.

NOW WE DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR OBJECTIONS TO THE IDEA OF A STEP THERAPY EXCEPTION PROCESS INDEED- ONE ALREADY EXISTS- RATHER WERE CONCERNED THAT THE NEW LANGUAGE- IS SOMEWHAT VAGUE AND SUBJECTIVE TO THE POINT THAT THE PROCESS IMAGINED IN THIS BILL- WOULD COMPEL PLANS TO COVER NON PREFERRED. EXPENSIVE BRAND NAME DRUGS EVEN WHEN LOWER COST GENERICS OR PREFERRED BRAND NAME ALTERNATIVES ARE AVAILABLE AND CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE- WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE HOWEVER THAT THE AUTHORS TAKING AMENDMENTS TODAY SOME OF WHICH WE HAVE SUGGESTED IT- AND OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WILL HAVE TO ANALYZE- WE APPRECIATE THE OPENNESS OF THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR TO CONSIDER OUR ISSUES- FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL- SOME OF OUR ISSUES ARE BEING ADDRESSED- BUT AGAIN- WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE AND SO WE AINTAIN OUR OPPOSE POSITION AT THIS TIME- ONE ISSUE THAT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT.

AB FOUR FIFTY ONE WILL REMOVE BARRIERS AND CURRENT LAW TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUAL SEEKING EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES HAVE TIMELY ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL CARE AND SERVICES. THAT MAY BE NEEDED. LIKE MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS MAY SEEK CARE AT THE NEAREST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AFTER EVALUATION BY AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN SOME INDIVIDUALS NEED ADDITIONAL PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES AND REQUIRE TRANSFERRED TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. HOWEVER EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS HAVE EXPERIENCED TROUBLE TRANSFERRING PATIENTS TO PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES THAT DO NOT MAINTAIN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THERE IS A CONCERN THAT SOME PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS ARE USING LANGUAGE IN CURRENT LAW WHICH ONLY APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS THAT MAINTAIN AND OPERATE AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AS A WAY TO NOT ACCEPT ALL PATIENTS OFTEN BASED ON THEIR PERCEIVED INABILITY TO PAY. IF A PSYCHIATRIC POSSIBLE AVOIDS TAKING PATIENTS IT LIMITS ACCESS TO CARE AND REDUCES CAPACITY OF ALREADY SCARCE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. THERE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL PATIENTS FACING AN EMERGENCY MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS REGARDLESS OF THE ABILITY TO PAY. AB FOUR FIFTY ONE PROVIDES A CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO PATIENT ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC TRANSFERS BY REQUIRING ALL HOSPITALS TO ACCEPT HIGHER LEVEL PSYCHIATRIC TRANSFERS REGARDLESS OF A PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY. I AM JOINED TODAY BY WITNESSES TEN MADDEN WAS THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND JULIE SNYDER GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE.

A FEDERAL LAW THOSE. A MERCY DEPARTMENTS TO TREAT ANYONE WHO IS IN NEED OF CARE FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION REGARDLESS OF THEIR INSURANCE STATUS OR ABILITY TO PAY. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING A GAP WHICH REQUIREMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPLANT PATIENTS WITH EMERGENCY MEDICAL PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION. FOR MANY SETBACK PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS THE NURSES SESSION IS ABLE TO STABILIZE THE PATIENT. BUT THE PATIENT IS STILL EXPERIENCING AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION AND THE SITUATION. EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN NEEDS TO TRANSFER THE PATIENT TO A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY TO RECEIVE A HIGHER LEVEL CARE TO TREAT THEIR STILL EXISTING EMERGENCY. DOCTOR AND BILL MENTIONED WE ARE EXPERIENCING SOME PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES THAT WILL NOT TAKE THESE PATIENTS WITH AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL PSYCHIATRIC PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION. DUE TO THERE BEING UNINSURED OR MEDICAID ROLLY. THIS BREAKDOWN IN THE MERCY CARE SYSTEM NEEDS TO PATIENTS LANGUISHING IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FOR DAYS GOING ON WEEKS TO RECEIVE CARE TO THEIR MERCY. MEDICAL PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION. AB FOUR FIFTY ONE WOULD AND SHE- PSYCHIATRIC YET FACILITY ARE NOT ABLE TO. FOR CHERRY. PATIENTS BASED ON THEIR STATUS OR TO PAY. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE PATIENTS EXPERIENCING A PSYCHIATRIC. EMERGENCY THE SAME ACCESS TO EMERGENCY CARE AS ANY PATIENT EXPERIENCING A NON PSYCHIATRIC MEDICAL MERGING.

THE HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE CARE HOWEVER PATIENTS NEED TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SHE WAS PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY AND ADDS THAT BOTH KIM AND DR RANDALL HAD MENTIONED RIGHT NOW PATIENTS ARE LANGUISHING IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ESPECIALLY MEDIC HELP PATIENT. BECAUSE SOME PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES ARE REFUSING PATIENTS THEY FOUND THEREIN SHALL BATTLE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB SIX ONE NINE WOULD ESTABLISH A COPD AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AND WOULD REQUIRE COUNTIES TO CREATE PLANS FOR MANAGING THE EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE SMOKE ON VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. COPD REFERS TO A GROUP OF LUNG DISEASES THAT CAN BE TRIGGERED BY EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTANTS AND CAN CAUSE AIR FLOW BLOCKAGE FOR BREATHING RELATED PROBLEMS. OUR STATE CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES WHICH HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE THREAT OF THE DANGEROUS AIR QUALITY TO LONG HEALTH.

THANK YOU FOR MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB THREE THREE SIX THIS BILL WOULD RATHER POSITION SURGEONS AND DOCTORS OF PODIATRIC MEDICINE WE FOR AUSTIN PEAY IN OTHER STATES IN A ONE TIME TEMPER CERTIFICATION TO USE WASABI X. RAY EQUIPMENT FOR THE SURGEON CERTIFICATION DO YOU CROSSED BEING IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WOULD ENABLE THEM TO USE FOR US TO BE IN PRACTICE FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS. FROM DATE OF ISSUE. CALIFORNIA'S PROCESS FOR A PERMANENT CERTIFICATION AS OUTDATED. TAKES ABOUT SIX TO NINE MONTHS TO OBTAIN THROUGH PHYSICAL APPLICATIONS USING GENERAL MAIL- THAT TIME THE SURGEON IS UNABLE TO PERFORM FEROCITY X. RAY EQUIPMENT AND SURGERY TO HELP THEIR PATIENTS. AB THREE FIVE SIX WOULD AUTHORIZE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE A POSITION A SURGEON OR DOCTOR THAT ACCIDENT MEDICINE A ONE TIME NON RENEWABLE TEMPORARY PERMIT. TO OPERATE ROSS COPIC X. RAY EQUIPMENT THEIR LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE USED ROSCO P. IN ANOTHER STATE HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME IS MISTER RYAN SPENCER THE CALIFORNIA PODIATRIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND MISS KIM STONE REPRESENTED CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'LL HAVE THE START OF ADVOCACY AND IN SUPPORT AND I'M GONNA GIVE MY TIME TO DR RUSSELL NORD AND BE AVAILABLE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU THIS IS ROCK OR HERE- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AS KIM MENTION MY NAME IS RUSSELL NORTON I'M AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON PRACTICING IN FREMONT IT ALSO SERVES THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION THE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING OUR COMPETING SEARCH. I DEFINITELY WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE VERY CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THIS BILL. I DEFINITELY HELPFUL INDEED THANK YOU. SO THIS IS BACKGROUND TO START FOR US COULD BE IS A CRITICAL AND UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED TOOL AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY AND MEDICINE IN GENERAL. IT'S A MODALITY WHEREBY WIDE X. RAYS OR SEEN IN REAL TIME AND SHOT BY A MOBILE MACHINE FOR THE ANGLE OF THE VIEW CAN BE CHANGED EFFICIENTLY. WHAT COULD BE USED IN MANY SETTINGS PERHAPS KNOWS MOST NOTABLY IN THE OPERATING ROOM. WHERE TIME IS CRITICAL AND THE PATIENT IS RELATIVELY IMMOBILE. DOES REQUIRING THE MACHINE TO CHANGE POSITION RATHER THAN THE PATIENT. ONE EXAMPLE ACROSS COULD BE USED AS WITH THE OPERATIVE FIXATION OF FRACTURES USING THINGS LIKE PLATE SCREWS RODS AND PAY. BOTH THE BOND AND THE METAL HAVE TO BE POSITIONED PERFECTLY SO AS TO ALLOW THE PATIENT TO HEAL PROPERLY. IF THIS ISN'T DONE WELL DONE CAN FAIL TO HEAL CAN HE ON THE WRONG ALIGNMENT OR HARDWARE CAN BE PROMINENT AND REQUIRE REMOVAL. THEN THE PATIENT BACK TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL SEARCH. WHAT CRITICAL PERON TO BE THE ULTIMATE DANGEROUS AS IT INVOLVES RADIATION. THAT'S WHY DOCTOR SUCH AS WHAT THE X. SURGEONS USED FOR US TO BE IN THEIR PRACTICE. RECEIVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING ON ITS USE IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS AND WE ALSO WANT TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR CO WORKERS. THAT'S WHY EVERYONE IS SPECIAL TECHNIQUES TO MINIMIZE RADIATION EXPOSURE TO ALL PARTIES. SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM. WHAT SURGEONS MOVED TO CALIFORNIA FROM OTHER STATES. OFTEN UNDERSERVED AND RURAL AREAS. WHILE THE RECEIVER CALIFORNIA MEDICAL LICENSE THERE FOR US OULD BE CERTIFICATION PROCESSING OFTEN LACKED. IT PRECLUDES THE SURGEON FROM TAKING EMERGENCY ROOM CALL AND TREATING PATIENTS. BECAUSE OF THE USE OF FOR US COULD YOU BE REQUIRED FOR THE SURGERY DID STEM FROM THESE ACTIVITIES. MANY ORTHOPEDIST HAVE USE FOR OFTEN OTHER STATES FOR YEARS WITHOUT NEEDING A SPECIAL CERTIFICATION. YOU WHEN THEY COME TO CALIFORNIA THEY'RE OFTEN SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THEY MUST TAKE AND PASS THE STATE MANDATED TESTS. BEFORE THEY CAN USE THIS TECHNOLOGY. ONLY ALASKA HAS A SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS. THE CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION HAS GOTTEN COMPLAINTS MARKETING SURGEON THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THE PROCESS OF TAKING FOR THE PROPERTY TAX. CAN BE CUMBERSOME AND LENGTHY SEVERAL REPORTS ARE THAT THE PROCESS CAN TAKE OVER SIX MONTHS. THIS DELAY IN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ABILITY TO TREAT ARE INJURED CALIFORNIANS CAN CERTAINLY CREATE ACCESS TO CARE ISSUES. ESPECIALLY IN MORE RURAL AREAS WITH LOWER GEOGRAPHIC DENSITY IS WORKING EXCERPTED. AT THE HELP COMMITTEE SUPPORTED THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL FOURTEEN TO NOTHING. AND WE NOW HAVE THE SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA'S RADIOLOGIST. I WOULD URGE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL TO ALLOW FOR A TEMPORARY PERMIT FOURTH PEDIC'S SURGEONS WHO WERE USING FOR US TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ANOTHER STATE. TO CONTINUE USING THIS MODALITY IN CALIFORNIA FOR TWELVE MONTHS WELL THE CALIFORNIA CERTIFICATION IS IN PROCESS. BUT THE ALLOWING THEM TO CARE FOR INJURED CALIFORNIA.

AND AMPLIFIED BEFORE YOU IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BILLS. EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY THREE AND ALIGNED WITH THE INITIAL INTENT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH WANTS TO TRANSFORM THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. ARE PARTNERING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE WE ARE GROUND ZERO. WHERE POINT TO PROVIDE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES EVERY DAY IN OUR POOL. WE ARE WHERE THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TURN TO HOLD OUR FIRST TO HEAR WHEN THERE'S A TRAGEDY OR LOSS IN THE FAMILY. WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS IN THE COMMUNITY WE'RE ON THE FRONT LINES OF SPEAKING WITH STUDENTS FOR EXPERIENCING POSTNATAL IDEATION AND OTHER CRIED DISEASE. SCHOOLS ARE THE CENTER OF EVERY COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE TO WAIT MATHIS AND ACTIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC. YES WHO'S OFTEN LACK THE INTERNAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES. THE LOCAL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IMPLEMENTATION HAVE FAILED TO CONSIDER. AT THE CENTRAL ENTITIES FOR DRESSING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. LEAVING PEOPLE TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. AB EIGHT EIGHT THREE REQUIRES THAT COUNTIES WORK WITH LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. TO DEVELOP PLANS TO UTILIZE UNSPENT. REVERTED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS L. UNIFIED HAD BEEN BACK IN OUR OWN LOCAL RESOURCES TO ESTABLISH OVER FIFTY BASED HEALTH CLINICS. AND FIFTY WELLNESS CENTER WE HAVE A PROXIMALLY THOUSAND MENTAL HEALTH VISITS ANNUALLY. AS PART OF THE PATH TO RECOVERY ONLY UNIFIED IS INVESTING. OVER A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. ONE TIME STATE AND FINE TO EACH WITH. SOCIAL AT OTHER. SO HOW STUDENTS AND THEIR TO WE- AND TALK TO REDUCE. DURING THE RETURN SCHOOL COMPACT FINE STEVEN BATHROOM ARE JUST PART OF OUR- TO MAKE SURE STUDENT GETS SUPPORT THEY- AND THE BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATE.

COULD BE YOU THE FACT TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH TO STUDENTS IN SCHOOL BASED PROGRAM. AS WE RE OPEN ARE COOL WE HAVE A BIG TASK AHEAD WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE TRAUMA AND THE PAIN THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST YEAR. WE SIMPLY CANNOT PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF AND WE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRIVE FOR GROWTH AREA FOR THE PREVENT STUDENTS FROM LEARNING AND TO OPTIMIZE HEALTH AND WELLNESS SO ALL STUDENTS CAN THRIVE BUT WE SPEAK YOUR SUPPORT. WE'RE PLEASED TO SPONSOR EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHT THREE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. OUR WAS THAT WITNESS PLEASE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON SIR PERSON WOULDN'T ELSE IS THEN TODAY- AT MY PRIVILEGE MA'AM DOLLARS FISCAL OF THE CALIFORNIA TERMS TRUCKS. ACCOUNTED FOR BOTH- THE NEXT SURFACED IN YOUR BEEN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND ANSWER A NUMBER OF YEARS AS THE DIRECTOR. OF THE ON THE COUNTY HEALTHCARE SERVICE AGENCY. WELL LOST OVER TO OUR AND FORTY. AND INCLUDING TO SEVEN SEVEN AUTONOMOUS. I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT SIDES THE FIRST OF SOLUTION EMPLOYEE FURNISH PERSPECTIVE OF ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATOR WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ROLLOUT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND THAT'S THE EIGHT EIGHT THREE. IN HOPES THAT IT CAN AND WILL LEAD TO GREATER PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION AMONG SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES. THEY WILL ENSURE THAT DOLLARS THAT ARE NOT SPENT. WILL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND ARE RISK AVERSION WILL BE REPURPOSED TO CHOKE TO BENEFIT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES THAT THEY WERE INTENDED TO SERVE WHEN WE ALL WORK SO HARD TO PASS THIS EXTRAORDINARY ACTS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. AT R. VERY COMPELLING WHICH THAT SCHOOLS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ANY RESPONSE AT SCALE. SURE YOU FELT HEALTH CRISIS THAT HAS LITERALLY SEEN TWICE AS MANY OF OUR CHILDREN TO TRY TO KILL THEMSELVES IN THE DECADE BEFORE CALLED IT. IMPACT OF CODE HAS BEEN STRIKING. WITH MORE THAN 30% INCREASES IN CRISIS SERVICES AMHERST APARTMENTS. AND WE MUST ACCEPT THE REALITY THAT 75% OF MENTAL ILLNESS MANIFESTS IN EARLY ADULTHOOD. AT A TIME WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE USE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AT THE LOWEST LEVELS. CHILDREN AGED EIGHTEEN ACCESS HEALTHCARE SERVICES AT THE LOWEST RATE OF ANY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. SCHOOLS ARE NOT ONLY NEED A THE SERVICES THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM MUST ENTER ITS RESPONSE TO THE NEWS HOW QUICK MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN SCHOOLS. THE REALITY OF MENTAL HEALTH PLAN BUDGETING AND OPERATIONS PUTS EXTRAORDINARY PRESSURE ON AND THIS IS A DOLLARS THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THERE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE ON SPENT HOURS. BECAUSE OF THE RULES OF AN HSA WHICH REQUIRE RESEARCHERS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE BURDENSOME ADMINISTRATIVE OBLIGATIONS THAT MENTAL HEALTH PLANS FACE AS I MENTIONED I THINK THE PRESSURE FROM BOTH SIDES. THERE WILL INEVITABLY BE RESERVES. ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF THE BOOM AND BUST CYCLE THAT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS MUST LIVE AND THEY WOULD LIVE ON REALIGNMENT DOLLARS WHICH ARE A STAPLE JIM VEHICLE LIKE TO SPEAK WITHOUT TAX. SO THINK NEW CARS IN THE MALL WHEN YOU NEED MONEY THE MOST IN A LOCAL STATION THAT YOU LOSE THAT. MENTAL HEALTH PLAN REVENUES HAVE- RELIED ON IMAGES SAY I'VE GOT SERVICE. SO WHEN YOU DOLLARS ARE AT RISK OF REVERSION IT'S NOT FAIR THAT THEY BE REMOVED. AND REPRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RETURN TO THIS CRITICAL. MASSES OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION. IN CONCLUSION THIS BILL ADDRESSES. CHALLENGES IT PROMOTE AND ENHANCE ENHANCES PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN COUNTY NOT HELP MEN AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT EXTENDS THE REVERSION WINDOW AND ALLOWS FOR DOLLARS AT RISK AVERSION TO BE RE ALLOCATED IN SERVICE OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THEY WERE MEANT. TO SERVE. IT'S GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IT'S GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND IT'S GOOD FOR OUR COLLECTIVE OBLIGATION TO PROMOTE COLLABORATION AMONG AND BETWEEN CHILD SERVING SYSTEMS THANK YOU.

WHENEVER THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB SIX THIRTY EIGHT AS WE ARE ALL AWARE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMON HEALTH CONDITIONS FACED BY CALIFORNIANS OVER THE PAST YEAR WITH CLOVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN HEALTH PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AND SENSATIONAL FROM OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS AND WORKPLACES HAS CAUSED PEOPLE TO FEEL STRESS ANXIETY FEAR AND LONELINESS. ALL OF THESE NATURAL RESPONSES HAVE TRIGGERED MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ALONG WITH. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND COULD HAVE A LONG LASTING EFFECT ON PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AFTER THE PANDEMIC IS OVER. BUT THAT ALSO DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUES WE HAD BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER I KNOW TOO TOO OFTEN WE HAVE SEEN OUR STUDENTS STRUGGLE IN ORANGE COUNTY TRAPASSO IT'LL HAS ACTUALLY HAD TO OPEN UP AN ADOLESCENT USE. OF ADOLESCENT. VISIBILITY AND THIS IS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS MANY MANY SOME. THEIR PATIENTS AS YOUNG AS EIGHT. YOUNG GIRLS THAT ARE CUTTING BULLETIN BULIMIA AND OTHERS BUT THIS BILL ADDRESSES ADDICTION. AND WHAT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH DOG DOLLARS WE KNOW THAT ALL TOO OFTEN PATIENTS THAT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND SUFFER FROM ADDICTION OR OFTEN TRACKED INTO TWO DIFFERENT SERVICE AREAS AB SIX THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THE COMPLEX NEEDS AND SERVICES OF THOSE. WITH CO. OCCURRING ISSUES BY AUTHORIZING PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES THAT ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS SUBSTANCE USE OR MISUSE NEEDS OR NEEDS RELATING TO CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES UNDER THE MAP MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. DRUG RELATED OVERDOSE FATALITIES HAVE RISEN 50% SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND IS ONE OF THE TOP TEN LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN OUR STATE. OVERDOSE RELATED DEATHS ARE RISING HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA THAN IN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE TWELVE MONTHS BETWEEN JUNE TWENTY NINETEENTH AND JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND OVER DAY DOSE DEATHS WHICH EQUALS APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN OVERDOSE FATALITIES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. BASICALLY WE HAVE A CLEAR NEED AND I AM HERE TO PRESENT THIS AND WE HAVE TO WITNESSES TODAY WITH US DR DONOVAN WHO IS CHAIR OF PSYCHIATRY DEPARTMENT OF CEDAR SINAI MEDICAL AND COMMISSIONER OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. AND ALSO BY ELIA VELARDO DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FROM THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SOME OF OUR QUICK SILVA SOLE GO TO OF THOSE WITNESSES NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY- MY NAME IS DE TITANIC WHICH- I AM THE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT THE COUNTRY AT CEDAR SINAI HOSPITAL. I'M ALSO- BOARD MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AND AS YOU JUST HEARD I SERVE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. ON BEHALF OFTHE COMMISSION I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB SIX THIRTY EIGHT. ONE THING ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK SILVA FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE. USE NEEDS AND FRAUD DURING THIS BILL. SB SIX THIRTY EIGHT AUTHORIZES THE USE OF AN HSA FUNDING. TO SUPPORT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE USE. AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH WHO CO OCCURRING DISORDERS. I THINK THAT LAWS NECESSARY FOR THREE REASONS I DON'T TRY TO PUT IT AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE- FIRST. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IS A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. IN MY CLINICAL PRACTICE I REGULARLY SEE THAT THESE CONDITIONS ARE LINKED FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MAY HAVE FAMILY OR FRIENDS WITH ADDICTION I'M SURE YOU SEE THE SAME. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR POLICIES IS REALLY A RELIC OF AN OUTDATED UNDERSTANDING. THE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR ON THIS AND IT'S Y. CROSS THE FIELD IN PSYCHIATRY. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY INTEGRATE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES TOGETHER WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS- THAT THE STOP- BILL DOES. AT SECOND SUBSTANCE USE IS A MAJOR COMPLICATING FACTOR FOR MOST OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS- SO ACROSS THE BOARD WITH EVERY ABUSES ASSOCIATED WITH FORCE RESPONSE TO TREATMENT MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS PLUS RECOVERY AND AS YOU MAY KNOW PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS DIE ON AVERAGE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS EARLIER THAN NORMAL. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS IS TOBACCO USE ALCOHOL USE ILLICIT DRUG USE HAVING SEPARATIST ARMS AND- AND SEPARATE EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEMS JUST MEANS PEOPLE SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS. AND THIRD I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT USING SUBSTANCES EARLY IN LIFE. INCREASES LIFETIME RISK OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTION AND PARTICULARLY FOR YOU. CHILDREN IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SEPARATE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION IT'S REALLY ONE OF THE SAME. I THINK AB SIX THIRTY EIGHT WILL STRENGTHEN THE MHSAA OKAY CONSUMERS PRACTITIONERS IN OUR BROADER MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IMPROVE TOOLS TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. ON BEHALF OF MYSELF IN THE COMMISSION I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT SB SIX THIRTY EIGHT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE- WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES.

THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES COMMITTEE- THAT PRODUCERS FOR EXERCISE DIFFERENCE IN AGE OF PROPHETIC BIOLOGY- AND WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS- THE CONSTRUCTION- VIRUSES- SUCH AS USING SYNTHESIS PRODUCTS- FROM SCRATCH THAT- WHAT POST ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING BIODEFENSE RISK THAT THE NATION FACES AT THIS TIME SO THIS IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD FOR BIO SECURITY IT ADDRESSES BASIC BIOSECURITY GAPS IN OUR CURRENT APPROACH TO GENES THAT THAT THE SCREENING- AS YOU NO JEANS TO THE TEST AND OTHER- SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TOOLS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ADVANCES IN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND WE CERTAINLY ENJOYED. THE FRUITS OF THAT- INCLUDING YOU KNOW THE VACCINE DEVELOPMENT BUT- BUT OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS CAN BE TOO EASILY MISUSED FOR CRIME SO THIS BILL PROMOTES RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR OF COMPANIES- IT- IT PROMOTES RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO USE THEIR PRODUCTS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR FIRST I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. BURZUM HERE TO DAY TO PRESENT AB ELEVEN THIRTY WHICH CREATES THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. WITHIN THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE ADMINISTRATION PARTICULARLY STAFF IN AUST PAD WHO ARE MY PARTNERS ON THIS INITIATIVE. BUT ALSO LIKE THE MANY STILL THINK THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS I HOPE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS PROPOSAL. HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. AND ONLY CONTINUES TO GROW. EIGHT OUT OF TEN AMERICANS FOR NUNES. SAY THAT MAKING HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE MORE AFFORDABLE IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OR VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. YOU MAY RECALL THAT A COUPLE YEARS AGO THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REGULATED RATES WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. LET ME BE CLEAR THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT DO THAT. AB ELEVEN THIRTIES APPROACH IS BASED ON DATA AND TRANSPARENCY BY CREATING AN OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING. AND ANALYZING INFORMATION AND ESTABLISHING COST TARGETS. IN RESPONSE TO STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WE HAVE MINIMIZE NEW DATA REQUIREMENTS AND QUALITY MEASUREMENT STANDARDS TO ASSURE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ARE LESSENED. WE'VE ADJUSTED THE TIMELINE SO THAT NO ENFORCEABLE TARGET WILL BE IN PLACE UNTIL AT LEAST TWENTY TWENTY SIX. TO ALLOW THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK TO OCCUR AND FOR HEALTH CARE INTRODUCED TO BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROCESS. THE PROCESS OF HIS PROCESS OF IMPORTANT FOR SMITH IS NOT MEANT TO BE PUNITIVE ON THE FRONT END IT'S NOT PUNITIVE ON THE FRONT END. IT ALLOWS ENTITIES TO WORK WITH THIS NEW OFFICE TO DEVELOP A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. BEFORE ENFORCING MISSED TARGETS WITH FINES. THE CONCEPT OF A COMMISSION OR OFFICE CHARGED WITH COST CONTAINMENT IS NOT A NEW ONE. THERE ARE SIX OTHER STATES THAT HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE ALREADY AND THEY ARE SHOWING RESULTS. YES YES YES THESE THESE OTHER STATES ARE NOT AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS CALIFORNIA. WE CAN NO LONGER WAIT. TO ADDRESS GROWING HEALTH CARE COSTS. THERE ARE STILL IMPORTANT ISSUES WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT HAVE YET TO BE RESOLVED INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF WHICH PROVIDERS WILL BE IN. RECESS EXEMPTED FROM THE BILL. MY INTENT IS NOT TO CAPTURE EVERY OFFICER ENTITY IN THE STATE BUT RATHER FOCUS ON THOSE GROUPS OR ENTITIES THEIR DOMINANT OF DOMINO NOT IF IN AN AREA. THAT THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PRICING. HAVING SAID THAT THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INCLUDE THOSE ENTITIES IN THE HEALTHCARE SPACE THAT ARE DRIVING COSTS. WHETHER BY THEIR SIZE OR GEOGRAPHIC MARKET INFLUENCE. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ISSUE AS I DO WITH EVERYONE OF MY BILLS TO CONSIDER ANY OTHER REASONABLE CONCERNS. WITH ME HERE IN SUPPORT TODAY. YASMEEN POLET AND DEATH CAPELLE REPRESENT REPRESENTING HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND WILLIAM KRAMER REPRESENTING THE PACIFIC BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBM. LET'S MOVE TO THE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS YES MENTALITY WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WE ARE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN THIRTY WHICH WOULD CREATE THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. EVERY CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUT PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IS BEING HIT BY THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE PAYING HIGHER PREMIUMS DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS AND FEELING THE IMPACT OF STAGNATING WAGES. HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE RISING FASTER THAN GENERAL INFLATION AND BEACHES AND MANY CONSUMERS FOR LOW CARE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT. GETTING MEDICATIONS DOCTOR VISITS LAB TESTS OR OTHER NECESSARY CARE. THE OFFICE WOULD HELP HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY TAKES AIM TO TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO CONTAINING HEALTH CARE COSTS. RESULTING FROM YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT CAN WORK WELL WE APPRECIATE IT PASSED COST CONTROL PROPOSAL BUT HAVE TACKLED THE SUSPECT MARKET. HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE WILL HAVE A CONCRETE VIEW OF THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THE OFFICE WOULD SET AND AFFORDABLE COST ER YEAR FOR THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEVY FINANCIAL PENALTIES OR OTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION IF INTENSITY EXCEEDS THE TARGET. THE TARGET COULD BE SET BY SECTOR AND WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT REGIONAL VARIATION RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENCES AND COMPLEXITY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM UNLIKE RATE SETTING WHICH SAW THE DOCTOR VISIT IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DOLLARS OR HOSPITAL STAY AT THE 150% OF MEDICARE. THE TARGET SERVER THE OVERALL GOAL THE INDUSTRY MUST MEET BUT PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY TO ACHIEVE IT IN A WAY THAT WORKS WITHIN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. AND ALSO GIVEN THE INDUSTRY THE TOOL TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND EQUITY WHILE REDUCING COSTS BY EMPHASIZING PRIMARY AND BEHAVIORAL CARE AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS. LET'S OFFICE DOES NOT SINGLE OUT ANY ONE PART OF THE INDUSTRY BUT INSTEAD RECOGNIZES THE ROLE THAT HOSPITALS HEALTH PLANS MEDICAL GROUPS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM PLAY TOGETHER AND FINDING THE BEST SOLUTION. TO PREVENTING HIGHER COSTS. THE AMENDMENTS TODAY- REMEMBER TO TODAY MAY PROGRESS AND CLEAR. AND IMPROVING THE BILL AND WE LOOK TO WORK WITH THE ON DR ON A- AMENDMENTS. THAT THE ADVICE BOARD AND DOMINATED BY THOSE THAT ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE COST OF HEALTHCARE. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I THOUGHT. JUST MOVED TO THE SECOND TEST MONEY. GOOD AFTERNOON TO THE CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER COMMENTS ON AB ELEVEN THIRTY I'M BILL KRAMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH POLICY AT THE PURCHASER BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH. NOT FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE PACIFIC BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH CARE NOT FOR PROFIT COALITION BASED IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING NEARLY FORTY LARGE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS AND PUBLIC ENTITIES. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSED OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. ALL OF YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH GREETINGS NATURAL BARRIERS FOR PATIENTS TO GET NECESSARY CARE. IT ALSO PUTS A SEVERE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS THAT PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND FAMILIES THERE BY CROWDING OUT THE DISINVESTMENT AND WORKERS WAGES. WE KNOW THE HEALTHCARE COSTS COULD BE LOWER MUCH LOWER WHILE MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF CARE. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE ABOUT UNNECESSARY SPENDING IS 2230% OF TOTAL SPENDING. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN GROUPS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES. AT MUCH LOWER COST THAN OTHER PROVIDERS. THIS BILL PRESENTS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD DOWN THE COST OF CARE AND BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WILL BE AFFECTED BECAUSE ONE IN ITS SCOPE IS BROAD TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. QUALITY ACCESS AND EQUITY IN ADDITION TO COST. TO IT WILL SET APPROPRIATE COST TARGETS BUT MEANINGFUL INCENTIVES FOR MEETING THOSE TARGETS. AND THREE IT WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO PROVIDERS FOR HELP IN MEETING THE TARGETS. THERE IS ONE ELEMENT OF THE BILL HOWEVER THAT WE BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED. THE ROLE OF THE ADVISORY BOARD IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ITS MEMBERS ARE ACTING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC HE SPECIFICALLY THE PORTION ASSURING THE INTERESTS OF PATIENTS CONSUMERS AND PURCHASERS. THOSE WHO RECEIVE HEALTH SERVICES AND PAY FOR THEM OUR PRIMARY. I TOOK IS PAID IN MANY ADVISORY GROUPS AND BOARDS THAT ARE COMPOSED OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE. EXPERTISE IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN THESE GROUPS THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PURCHASERS ARE OFTEN OVERWHELMED BY OTHER INTERESTS. AS A RESULT WE ARE OFTEN STYMIED IN OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD OUR GOALS LOWER COSTS AND BETTER QUALITY ACCESS AND EQUITY. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO COMMITTEE CONSIDER CHANGES TO ENSURE THAT THE ADVISORY BOARD. IS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PULIC. AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST BROAD LIKE. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION BE COMMENTS AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ARE NOW GOING TO- JUST TO GO TO THE- TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. WHO'S UP FIRST FOR TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. IT CANNELLA QUINLAN HAPPY TO JUMP IN YES. GLAZER VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM CANNELLA COIL AND I SERVICE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND I'M TESTIFYING TODAY BECAUSE THE EFFECT OF THIS BILL ON THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND ON YOU AS ELECTED LEADERS WILL BE ENORMOUS. I'M ALSO HERE BECAUSE I LEFT THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND FOR NINE YEARS A STATE THAT SETS HEALTHCARE SPENDING TARGETS LIKE THOSE PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. ON AB ELEVEN THIRTY CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS ARE OPPOSED UNLESS THE BILL IS AMENDED BECAUSE IN DOING THIS WE MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT CREATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT I BELIEVE WILL HAPPEN WITH THE BILL WAS DRAFTED WE HAVE OFFERED TO THE CANADIAN ALTERNATIVE TO THIS BILL TO MEET AFFORDABILITY OBJECTIVES. WELL THERE ARE MANY ISSUES I HOPE YOU'LL HEAR JUST. THREE POINTS TODAY. IT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO BECAUSE- ABOUT WHAT PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. IT HEALTHCARE COSTS IT HEALTHCARE PRICES THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS HEALTH CARE COSTS OR PRICES. IT HOW MUCH WE SPEND ON HEALTH CARE IS IT HOW MUCH WE SPEND PER PERSON ON HEALTH CARE. IT SPENDING BY CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING BY EMPLOYERS THIS BILL AN EXAMPLE DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RATE OF INCREASE IN PREMIUMS PAID BY EMPLOYERS. SO THE BILL pCRITICAL ISSUE. CALIFORNIA SPENDS LESS PER PERSON ON HOSPITAL CARE FOR EXAMPLE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE DESPITE HAVING THE THIRD HIGHEST COST OF LIVING IN THE NATION. AND LABOR COSTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE GROWING 10% FASTER THE NATIONAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING. CALIFORNIA'S THREE QUARTERS OF WHAT STATE LIKE MASSACHUSETTS SPEND PER CAPITA ON HEALTH CARE IF YOU'RE DEFINING THE PROBLEM. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE COST PRICE DECLINES IN SPENDING PER CAPITA IS CRITICAL. CORRECT AFFORDABILITY BE RESOLVED THE BILL LIMITS TO INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA. BUT HOW MUCH WE SPEND ON HEALTH CARE IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE COST OF CARE AND HOW MUCH CARE WE PROVIDE TO FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. HOW DO WE SEPARATE AND KEEP THE GOOD SPENDING FOR EXAMPLE MORE FOR PRIMARY CARE MORE FOR AN AGING POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA AND WALDRON EATING BAD SPENDING UNNECESSARY CARE INFLATED DRUG PRICES. THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO SO DO WE PROVIDE LESS CARE TO THOSE IN NEED IN ORDER TO MEET THE SPENDING CAPS. THE BILL WILL LIMIT HOW MUCH CALIFORNIA SPENDS ON CARE BUT NOT NECESSARILY MAKE CARE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR A TYPICAL CALIFORNIANS. AND FINALLY THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT AMENDED ARE REAL AND SERIOUS. CAPPING HEALTHCARE SPENDING SUGGESTS THAT TDAY WE'RE SPENDING THE RIGHT AMOUNT IN THE RIGHT PLACES. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDER RESOURCED SPENDING CAPS CAN LOCK IN THAT INEQUITY. WE NEED TO SPEND MORE ON COVERAGE AND CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS WE NEED TO SPEND MORE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE- CARE FOR MILLIONS IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY AFTER THE PANDEMIC. WHAT IS THE NEXT NEW TECHNOLOGY AND WHEN MIGHT THE NEXT DEADLY DISEASE ARE PANDEMIC ARRIVE. AND HEALTH CARE SPENDING CAP IN CALIFORNIA MEANS THAT WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY HEALTH CARE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE IN WASHINGTON DC NOT CALIFORNIA. RELATED TO MEDICARE OR MEDICAID OR SETTING A FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE DRUG PRICING POLICY OR MORE. ANY OF THOSE FEDERAL DECISIONS CAN AFFECT SPENDING. AND TRIP THE CALIFORNIA CAP. I TOLD CARL TURNER CREE TO COMMIT. LIKE THE ONE IN THIS BILL JUST LIKE DID TO INFORM THEM AND MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE FEDERAL MEDICARE PROGRAM. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT ARE PROPOSAL ASKS THE COMMISSION WITH DATA AND EXPERTISE TO DETERMINE KEY COST DRIVERS WHAT SHOULD BE MEASURED HOW IT SHOULD BE MEASURED WHAT SHOULD BE LIMITED AND WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POLICY CHANGE SHOULD BE MADE. TO MAKE CARE MORE AFFORDABLE WITH THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS GOING DIRECTLY TO THE% LEGISLATURE. THOSE MATTERS WE BELIEVE SHOULD NOT BE DETERMINED IN ADVANCE WITHOUT THE DATA AND CRITICAL ANALYSIS. AS COULD BE DONE IN THIS BILL. WE THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME AND WE DO VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MRS COYLE AND MOVING TO THE- SECOND WITNESS AND OPPOSITION. AND JUST A MAKING SURE TO I DIDN'T- THE SET MY TIMER THERE BUT JUST MAKING SURE TO BE BE GOOD ON TIME. SECOND WITNESS I. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL BE FREE- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRANDON MARCHING WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION- WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO AB ELEVEN THIRTY AM LACK MATHIS- POSITIONS HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF POLICY WORK TO ADDRESS THE RISING COSTS AND HEALTH CARE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PROFESSION DEVELOP POLICY PROPOSALS THAT WOULD CREATE AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT PRIORITIZES HEALTH IMPROVE. QUALITY AND REDUCE COSTS. WE ARE ENCOURAGED AB- THIRTY CONTAINS SOME VERSION OF SEVERAL OF THESE PROPOSALS SUCH AS THE REDUCTION OF THE MINISTRY OF BERGEN. THE STREAMLINING OF QUALITY REPORTING METRICS THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF VALUE BASED CARE ARRANGEMENTS AND INCREASED INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE. B. SECTIONS OF THE BILL DOES STILL IN NEED OF REFINEMENT WILL HELP TO CREATE COST SAVINGS FOR PATIENTS AND IMPROVE THE CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. HOWEVER AS WRITTEN AT ELEVEN THIRTY IS TO BROADEN SKILLED AND SALES TO FOCUS ON THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE TRUE CONTRACTORS WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AND STILL THE BILL TREATS A SINGLE PHYSICIAN PRACTICALLY NOTHING MORE PENALTY DOLLAR INSURANCE COMPANY OR HOSPITAL SYSTEM AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HE CORPORATE STRUCTURES. OPERATIONAL DIFFERENCES OR THE RELEVANCE OF MARKET SHARE WHICH CREATES SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES IN COST. WITHOUT MORE FOCUSED DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL THAT TAKE THESE FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT THE OFFICE WILL BE BOGGED DOWN BY MANUSIA AND ANALYSIS OF ENTITIES THAT DO LITTLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BUILDING CONCORD HEALTH CARE. ADDITIONALLY IT IS UNCLEAR WHY ON THE FINANCIALS CHEAT ARE NEEDED FROM PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY SINCE RELEVANT PROVIDER FINANCIAL DATA IS INCORPORATED EIGHT INCORPORATED INTO HEALTH PLAN DISCLOSURES THAT ALREADY. IT IS UNCLEAR WHY THE OFFICE WOULD NEED THESE REPORT OR HOW THEY WOULD BE HELPFUL IN CARRYING. OUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. AT THIS TIME CMA URGES THAT AB ELEVEN PM TO FOCUS THE NEW OFFICE COSTS. WITH THE MARKET PLACE. ENSURE TRENT. AND FOR THE PUBLIC AND HEALTH CARE ENTITIES. PROPERLY PROMOTE COMPETITION AND ENSURE THAT PROPER INTENT ARE GIVEN TO THE OFFICE REGULATED ENTITIES. TO PROMOTE AND ADOPT ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES AND OF OUR PATIENTS IN THE VALUE BASED CARE SYSTEM. WE LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS ON AT ELEVEN THIRTY AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION CONTINUES TO DO THEIR PART TO HELP CONTROL THE COST OF HEALTHCARE AND IMPROVE HEALTH CARE.

ELEVEN THIRTY ONE WOOD AND WE'RE TAKING- I'M SORRY I'M LOOKING AT THE WRONG THING YES- AND ELEVEN THIRTY NINE ELEVEN THIRTY ONE- AND- WE'RE TAKING. ON THOSE WHO WOULD JUST REGISTER THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION AND WHAT THEY SUPPORT OR OPPOSE THE BILL. MISTER MODERATOR. AT THE TIME THERE ARE NO OTHER THAN Q. WELL THAT WAS EASY ENOUGH OF NOW WILL COME BACK- TO THE THAT TE COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE- MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON. OKAY THANK YOU I'M SURE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF IT YOU KNOW I OF I THINK THAT WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO HATTER THE CONCEPT BEHIND THIS I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS SO- WHAT WOULD BE YOUR RESPONSE. ON WHETHER THIS TIES WOULD WOULD TIE THIS INTO SORT OF A MOMENT IN TIME AND BY THAT I MEAN TERMS OF LET'S SAY REPORTING RIGHT WHERE WE'D BE TIED INTO A SORT OF STANDARDS THAT EXIST TODAY. VERSES IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER THINGS MIGHT EXIST TOMORROW AND ON THAT NOTE TO. I JUST ASK YOU TO RESPOND TO THE POINT RAISED AND I HAVE A FIVE QUESTION BUT- IF THEY START HERE- THE POINT RAISED ABOUT. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FACT THAT THEY GET STANDARDS THAT WOULD BE SET DOWN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK CURRENTLY OBVIOUSLY WERE. IT TEND TO BE IN LINE WITH. THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. BUT THAT MIGHT NOT YOU KNOW BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND WHAT WE COULD ANTICIPATE POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE THAT MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE I'D LIKE TO GET RESPONSES. ON ON KIND OF THOSE TWO RELATED POINTS. WELL TO MAKE IT TO THIS ONE FIRST AND THEN I KIND. OF LOST YOU ON THE FIRST OKAY FIRST ONE BUT- SO ON THE SECOND ONE- YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE IF THERE ARE FEDERAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND- IT OUT THERE- THERE ISN'T ANYTHING IN FEDERAL LAW AT THIS POINT SO. YOU KNOW WE AS A STATE. YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL LAW SOMETIMES IS THE FLOOR NOT THE CEILING AND SO. SO WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY NEED IF WE- IF WE WERE IN CONFLICT WE WOULD NEED TO. RECTIFY THAT IF WE WERE TRYING TO BE LESS ARE MORE LENIENT THAN THE THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO THE IDEA THAT- AND PART OF WHAT I HEARD. IN THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY WAS WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST HAVE A COMMISSION IF YOU KNOW THAT THAT MAKES ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND- AND THEN SEND THOSE TO THE LEGISLATURE. I KIND WOULD ARGUE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. AND IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MOVE THESE POLICIES BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU YOU YOU MOVE A POLICY THERE'S HUGE OPPOSITION FROM WHATEVER ENTITY IS OUT THERE. WHO WHO MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THAT. SO GOING TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION AND I APOLOGIZE FOR IT YEAH MAYBE I WAS. SO MAY I WAS VAGUE ON THAT WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU RESPOND S. C. H. A. AND I THINK SEE A MALE SOME MENTION- BRING AT LEAST A COUPLE OF POINTS HAVING PROPOSED SOME SORT OF ALTERNATIVES HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THOSE AND WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AS IT MOVES FORWARD THROUGH THE PROCESS. WELL YEAH AND THE AND THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH WAS PUT FOR VICE BY CJ. IS EXACTLY WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED. LET'S HAVE SOME THE COMMISSION THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS AT THESE ISSUES AND THEN MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. WE DON'T HAVE A COMMISSION THAT DOES THAT INSTEAD WE HAVE. AN ALPHABET SOUP GROUP OF. ADVOCATES OUT THERE THAT DO THAT NOW PRESENT US WITH IDEAS WE RUN WITH THEM. AND YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE WITH SKYROCKETING HEALTH CARE PRICES SO. SO IT THAT SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING AS WELL AS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT. AS FAR AS THE U. U. S. ABOUT LIKE A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE'RE SENSITIVE. TO THE FACT THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC AND SO. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE COULDN'T SET TARGETS OR OR GOALS. BASED ON WHERE WE ARE NOW. BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY GATHER DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE. AND THEN WHEN WE- GOD WILLING OR IN A BETTER SITUATION OUT THERE WILL HAVE A WAY TO BEGIN TO KICK TO TABULATE THE DATA. FUTURE DATA AND THAT WE CAN WORK WITH- OUT THERE AND- AND BASE THINGS ON ON THAT. THE IDEA OF BEING CREATING CREATING GOALS. OKAY NEEDED RIGHT THAT I WAS ACTUALLY RESPONSE TO WHAT HE DID UNDERSTAND WHY SAMI BUT SAID NO THAT'S WHAT I WAS KIND OF GETTING OUT WAS. YOU KNOW THAT PARTICULAR THIS YEAR OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE AN ABERRATION ON A WHOLE. HOST OF LEVELS. THE WAY THE WAY THE WAY THE BILL'S BEEN AMENDED IT'S GONNA BE TWENTY TWENTY SIX. YEAH I WON'T BE HERE. WELL I MIGHT ADD ON. THE WAY OUT THE DOOR IT DOESN'T HIT ME. NOW OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR ON THIS AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WILL WANT TO KEEP. WORKING WITH YOU ASSESSMENT FOR BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE HAS BEEN GREAT THANK YOU. THEMES RANGE SIGN ANYBODY ELSE SO QUESTIONS GONE- MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER CHECK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I. WILL SUPPORT IT. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT MOVE FORWARD- MY ONLY CONCERN AND I BRIEFLY BROUGHT THIS UP. TO YOU JUST TODAY WAS ABOUT THE FACT THAT. THE HOW THIS BILL. POTENTIALLY IMPACTS SOME OF THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS AROUND THE STATE GIVEN THE ONE THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THEY DO GIVEN THE SAFETY NET THAT THEY PROVIDE- MY CONCERN WOULD BE THAT. I THINK THE REGULAR HOSPITALS CAN WORK THROUGH AND FIGURE IT OUT BUT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS GIVEN THE SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES THAT THE ADDRESS- THAT THAT'S WHERE I HAD SOME CONCERNS AND WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU ON THAT. THANK YOU WELL I THINK THANKYOU FOR THAT QUESTION IS MISTERS ERIN AND WHAT WE ENVISION IS ACTUALLY SUB SECTORS YOU KNOW HOSPITALS WOULD BE A SECTOR AND SUBSECTORS RECOGNIZING. THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF. OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF ARE YOU SEE HOSPITALS OUR OUR OUR OUR OUR OUR COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AS WELL SO THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO ALL HOSPITALS WANT TO RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE ARE SETTINGS LIKE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS AND TEACHING HOSPITALS THAT HAVE HIGHER COSTS IN THERE. THEY DID THEY JUST TAKE MORE TO RUN AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND SO WE WOULD ENVISION THESE B. B.'S BEING IN SUB SECTORS BUT WE DON'T ENVISION AND EXEMPTING. BECAUSE I STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS THROUGH EFFICIENCIES AND ELIMINATION OF WASTE. LOOKS IS THE MISTER NAZARIAN IS COMPLETED HIS. COMMENTS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- MISS BURKE. I AM I MIGHT I JUST WANT TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD. THANK YOU WE HAVE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU. MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. DID SHE WOULD BE OUT OF A CO AUTHOR AS WELL. YEAH ANY ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I JUST HAVE ONE WANTED TO. A TO ASK YOU A DOCTOR WOULD IT WAS BROUGHT UP ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITION TALKING ABOUT NO THE NAME OF THIS IS- THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. AND IT WAS- SAID THAT THIS WOULDN'T LOOK AT ALL AT ANY LABOR COSTS OR ANY OTHER COSTS- LIKE- THE EARTHQUAKE PRIME INSTANT AND SO FORTH. IS THIS LIMITED IN ANY WAY AND TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABILITY OR OR WHAT WILL THIS OF THIS OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO DIG INTO ANYTHING THAT IS GOING TO CREATE COST. WE ENVISION BROAD AUTHORITY AND WE VISITED A ROBUST WORKING GROUP OF ADVISORS THAT CAN LOOK AT LOOK AT LOOK AT EVERYTHING. AND RECOGNIZING YOU KNOW EARTHQUAKE SEISMIC IS IT IS AN ISSUE AND OTHER THINGS ARE ISSUE SO WE EMBRACE ENVISIONED THIS AS IS FAIRLY BROAD IN ITS IN ITS APPROACH. GREAT ALL RIGHT BACK ABOUT THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS BILL AND WITH A COUPLE- SO BUT AMID MOTION BY DURING THE SECOND BY MISS BURKE. SORRY MISTER NAZARIAN MADE THE MOTION THE SPARK A SECOND WITH THAT CARD PLEASE- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THANK YOU I'M SORRY WANNA CLOSE. WE DON'T MIND IT LIKE THE KILLERS I LIKE TO CLOSE BY READING SOMETHING AND I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES. FOR THEIR QUESTIONS COMMENTS BUT I WANT TO READ TO YOU THIS CAME OUT TODAY. CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION BLOG AND IT'S ENTITLED ALIGNING HEALTH CARE COSTS GROWTH WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH WOULD SAVE CALIFORNIA BILLIONS THAT'S BILLIONS WITH A- B. SO I'M GONNA READ THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT. FORTUNATELY THEY FIND THE RIGHT. READ IF I CAN FIND IT. IF CALIFORNIA SETS AND ACHIEVES A COST GROWTH TARGET LIKE THOSE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THERE IS A CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH HIS AND I'M HAPPY TO ROVIDE YOU THE LINKS AS CAT THE FOCUS- I CAN FIND IT I APOLOGIZE. I REALLY HATE IT WHEN THINGS ARE PRINTED ON BOTH SIDES. OKAY HERE WE GO. HERE% IS A CHART HERE BUT BUT THE POINT OF THIS IS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PER CAPITA GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA GREW AT A COMPOUNDED COUNTED ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF SIX COMPOUNDED ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN THE STATE'S OVERALL ECONOMY. THAT'S ONLY A POINT 4% DIFFERENCE SINCE THEN WE KNOW THAT THAT NUMBER IS ACTUALLY MUCH BIGGER IN FROM TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN OUT. IT'S GROWING AT MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN POINT 4% BUT EVEN IF AT THAT POINT 4% IF WE IF WE HAD SOME TARGETS HERE HAD CALIFORNIA CHIEF HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH IN LINE WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH IN LINE WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH. CONSUMERS AND TAX EIGHT PAIRS WOULD HAVE SAVED NEARLY FIFTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. WITH FOUR POINT POINT HEALTH CARE SPENDING IN THE PERIOD. THIS REPRESENTS A MEANINGFUL AND ACHIEVABLE PORTION OF THE STAGGERING 2225% OF WASTE. THE EXPERTS FOUND IN THE SYSTEM SO I'M NOT TRYING TO BE PUNITIVE HERE I'M TRYING TO GET PEOPLE THE ACTS TO WORK SMARTER BE MORE EFFICIENT. ELIMINATE WASTE. AND REDUCE THE GROWTH IN IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBM. I THINK WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND CAR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS. TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WOULD. HI WHAT I MAYES HI MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW NONVOTING. BONTA. BONTA AYE BURKE BURKE I CARILLO. HI FLORA. FLORIDA VOTING MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN AYE MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE NAZARIAN NAZARIAN AYE RIVAS RIVERSIDE RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I SANTIAGO. WALDRON. ELEVEN ZERO ELEVEN ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT. ARE MOVING ON TO- ITEM- THE ITEM NUMBER I CAN SEE THE NUMBER ITEM NUMBER TWENTY AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE A DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE ADDRESSES THE GAPS IN THE EXISTING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS INCONSISTENT AND INCOMPLETE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEMS AND ALMOST EVERY HOSPITAL AND CLINIC HAS A SIT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SYSTEM TAILORED TO ITS OWN NEEDS. THE FUTURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES CAN HELP VACCINE SCHEDULING BUT IT CAN ALSO COLLECT IMPORTANT DATA ON DEMOGRAPHICS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIMITED VACCINE SUPPLIES ACTUALLY REACHING THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES EQUITABLY. YOU WILL HEAR THAT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE OF FEDERAL LAW EFFORTS. AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE WILL LEVERAGE AND SUPPLEMENT FEDERAL EFFORTS AND WILL PROVIDE THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE ACCESS. EQUITY AFFORDABILITY PUBLIC HEALTH AND QUALITY GOALS WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY ARE ABNER MASON WHO WILL SPEAK. AS TO HOW A STATEWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE WILL SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S EQUITY EFFORTS IN IN IN IN ANNA RAMSEY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN I SPEAK WHO CAN SPEAK TO HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. MOVED TO THE FIRST- TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. A GOOD AFTERNOON ADD TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS THAT MAKE THAT I FOUNDER AND CEO COMPLAIN ABOUT- I THINK HAVING GATE MET AND NAVIGATION COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN LOS ANGELES. I'M NOT ON THE BORDER THE CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH NETWORK AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE CONNECTING FOR BETTER HEALTH COALITION WHICH REPRESENTS A DIVERSE GROUP OF THE HEALTHCARE LEADERS AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT AIMS TO ADVANCE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE THE POLICY. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF- OF AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE I CAN THINK OF DONALD WORKS WITH PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SO EMPLOYERS OTHER PARTNERS TO GIVE THEIR MEMBERS THE NEW LEVEL OF LINGUISTICALLY AND CULTURALLY TAILORED CARE. BECAUSE WHAT FAR TOO MANY PATIENTS- THEY'RE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS OVERLY COMPLICATED AND PERSONAL NOW HAVING DIFFERENT COMMUNITY APPROACHES THE MEETING HEALTH NEEDS OF NATURAL AND ACTUALLY IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING BUT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVING DIFFERENT HEALTH OUTCOMES IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THESE KINDS OF RACIAL ETHNIC AND INCOME RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES. ARE THE GAPS I WORK EVERY DAY TO CLOSE. I NEED LOOK NO THAN COVERED LIKE PANDA THIS. THIS AT IN. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE BY THE RABBIT COMMUNITIES OF. A COMMUNITY ABOUT THAT EMAIL IS A BILL. AND TRACKING WHICH PATIENT RECEIVED. ONE TO FOUR FOUR ZERO THROUGH THE- THANK. COME WHOLE PERSON CARE. WHICH REQUIRE DATA. GOOD HEALTH DATA WE CAN TRACK THE NEEDS OF A LATINO MAN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FORTY AND FIFTY FIVE LIVING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND FOR EXAMPLE. HOW TO ADDRESS THE SUSPICION THEY MAY HAVE ABOUT THE KOBE NINETEEN BACK CLEAN. BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT HAVE GOOD ACCESS TO HEALTH DATA. THAT'S BECAUSE HEALTH DATA IF. AND THE PATCHWORK OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH NETWORK HOSPITALS AND PROVIDE. YOU DELIVER THE WHOLE PERSON CARE WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL WE NEED A STATE BY THE HEALTH INFORMATION NETWORK THAT BREAK DOWN BARRIERS AND ALLOWS US TO HAVE ALL THE NECESSARY DATA AVAILABLE TO WORK. IN A SECURE WAY. UNDER AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE THE STATE WIDE INTO YOU NETWORK WITH HAVE RULE MAKING AUTHORITY. CHILDREN INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS ARE NOT CAUGHT IN RED TAPE THAT THEY ARE AND THEY ARE NOW WAITING ON AUTHORIZATION FROM STATE AGENCIES TO PROVIDE CORRECT CRITICAL DATA. WE NEED TO DELIVER EXCELLENT CARE. ADDITIONALLY AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE UNDER THIS BILL THE STATE WOULD WIDELY DELEGATE THE ACTIVITY I TO AN OPERATING ENTITY AN OPERATING ENTITY WOULD HAVE MORE LATITUDE THAN THE STATE TO NEGOTIATE- AND MANAGE CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE VENDORS. AND HAVE CRITICAL INDUSTRY AT THE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE WITH WHICH THE THINK THE NOT HAVE. THIS IS A PART OF THE BILL IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND WILL GREATLY IMPROVE ITS EFFICACY. THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A MORE CRITICAL MOMENT FOR CALIFORNIA TO BUILD A STATEWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION NETWORK WHICH WILL EMPOWER ORGANIZATIONS LIKE MINE. AND THE MANY OTHERS WHO ARE TODAY- UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN AND MEANINGFUL DATA EXCHANGE THAT ALLOW US TO FULLY SERVE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF ERIC OF EVERY CALIFORNIA. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YET BUT MAYBE. ELEVEN THIRTY ONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO. AND WILL MOVE TO THE SECOND SECOND ONE IS TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANNA I'M TWENTY FOUR AND I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES. I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS SOMEONE WITH A RARE AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER HOW URGENTLY WE NEED TO BUILD TRUST. AND MEANINGFUL DATA EXCHANGE THAT BENEFITS PATIENTS. I HAVE JUVENILE DERMATOMYOSITIS OR JDM FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS LIKE MYSELF WHO HAVE JDM SIMPLE THINGS LIKE WALKING AND HANGING OUT WITH FRIENDS IS EXHAUSTING. BECAUSE OF JDM I DEVELOPED ARTHRITIS IN MY KNEES AND HIPS. MAKING EVERY STEP I TAKE DIFFICULT I EVEN HAD TO GO ON CHEMOTHERAPY DURING HIGH SCHOOL AND AT THE BEGINNING OF COLLEGE. THIS LEFT ME CONSTANTLY FATIGUED AND IN PAIN SIMPLY SETTING UP NEXT YEAR WAS CHALLENGING LET ALONE GETTING THROUGH A FULL DAY OF WORK OR SCHOOL. ON TOP OF IT ALL I WAS EXPECTED TO MANAGE MY MEDICAL RECORDS WHEN I COULD BARELY MANAGE GETTING OUT OF BED. AT MY DISEASE PROGRESSED SO TOO DID THE DOCTORS SAID THAT TREATMENT AND MEDICATIONS I HAD TO KEEP TRACK OF. ALL COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN MY DOCTOR'S REMAIN STRAINED OR NONEXISTENT. I ENDED UP WITH HUGE BINDERS FULL OF MEDICAL RECORDS BUT I STILL KEEP TO THIS DAY. I NEED MY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO HELP ME HEAL NOT ADD MORE TO MY PLATE. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS GETTING IN SOME SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT LEADS ME IN THE ER UNCONSCIOUS. WITHOUT ACCESS TO MY RECORDS NO ONE WOULD KNOW ABOUT MY COMPLICATED HISTORY OR HOW TO GET ME BACK TO HEALTH. ALL OF THIS PRESSURE CAN'T BE ON PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE ON HEALING. WE THIS WONDERFUL IN FRONT OF YOU YOUR AN AWKWARD. TO STAND UP FOR THE MANY THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS LIKE ME. WHO UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A LIFE ALTERING DISORDER BUT DON'T WANT OUR ENTIRE LIVES TO BE DEFINED BY IT. BUILDING A HEALTH DATA HIGHWAY THAT IS AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE WOULD GIVE ME THE REASSURANCE AND THEN THE MARGIN SEE A PROVIDER CAN SAVE MY LIFE. RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE THAT REASSURANCE. AT ELEVEN THIRTY ONE IT'S HOW WE GET THERE. AT THE SAME TIME IF I NEED TO SEE DIFFERENT PROVIDERS ACROSS MULTIPLE NETWORKS TO GET NECESSARY CARE. THE BURDEN OF RECORD KEEPING FALLS ON ME AND MY CARE GIVERS. BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO BE PROVIDERS WERE ABLE TO CONSULT TOGETHER. THEY DON'T SHARE ONE DATA NETWORK. MY HEALTH INFORMATION IS NOT REGULARLY SHARED OR MADE READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL THOSE WHO NEED IT. AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE WOULD ENSURE UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION. CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN NETWORK AND LIFTING THE BURDEN OF COLLECTING INTERPRETING AND SHARING DATA. OFF OF MY SHOULDERS. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE TODAY TO STAND UP FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF EVERY CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- NOW WILL MOVE- TO- THOSE ARE GONNA PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. GO TO THE FIRST. ONE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS MARIA SPERBER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR OFFICE FOR THE ONGOING CONVERSATION AND CONSIDERATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH USE CASE ALTERNATIVE WE SHARED LAST WEEK. THANK YOU WE TO BELIEVE A STRONG SECURE EXCHANGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION DATA CAN BE A POWERFUL TOOL TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES REDUCE REDUNDANT TESTING AND LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS OVERALL AND HOSPITALS RECOGNIZE THE GREAT VALUE IN THIS DISCUSSION IN FACT FEATURING SHARES THE OVER ARCHING GOAL OF A BROAD. RICH EXCHANGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION HOWEVER THE SHARED GOALS ARE BEST TO COME ACCOMPLISHED BY LEVERAGING CURRENT NETWORKS ALIGNING WITH THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND IMPROVING THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND WOULD BE ILL SERVED BY BUILDING A NEW CENTRALIZED STATEWIDE DATA REPOSITORY. MANY HOSPITALS AND SYSTEMS REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION PRIVATE VENDORS AND OTHERS IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY EXCHANGE HEALTH INFORMATION SECURELY AND PRIVATELY THANKS TO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE LAST DECADE THAT ALLOW FOR THE SHARING OF CLINICAL RECORDS WITHIN THEIR OWN SYSTEM AND WITH EACH OTHER. EFFORTS AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL TO ENHANCE INFORMATION EXCHANGE ARE UNDER WAY AND PROVIDE A FORWARD LOOKING PATH FOR CALIFORNIA BUT ONLY IF STANDARDS ARE DEVELOPED THAT. STANDARDS AND SAFEGUARDS SHOULD GOVERN SHARING OF PATIENT HEALTH INFORMATION STANDARDS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE PARTY CHANGING HEALTH INFORMATION CAN EFFECTIVELY SEND AND RECEIVE INFORMATION. TO THAT END THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION RECOMMENDS THAT CALIFORNIA FOCUSED ON MODERNIZING THE CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO ENHANCE THE EXISTING CAPABILITY TO COLLECT ANALYZE AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATION UP THE SCALE NEEDED TO TALK ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH AND EQUITY CHALLENGES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AS YOU WORK TO ENHANCE PATIENT CARE AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH IN EQUITY WITHOUT SACRIFICING PATIENT RIGHT AND PRIVATELY. WITH US TODAY AND CHRIS MAHER CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AND ASSOCIATE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR QUALITY AND SAFETY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO TO GET MORE CONTACT IN A COMPLICATED ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO THAT SECOND NOW WITNESSED PROVIDE OPPOSITION. VERY MUCH MARIA I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE FIFTEEN DIFFERENT- MY NAME IS DR LONGHURST I'M WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO HEALTH. ALSO HERE SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION UNLESS AMENDMENTS THIS BILL- I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A STORY OVER THE LAST DECADE BECAUSEOF THE PRACTICING PEDIATRICIAN I'VE WITNESSED THIS FIRSTHAND AS WELL TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES. IS AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSOR. IN TWO THOUSAND TWO I ADMITTED HA- CHILD LUCILLE PACKARD CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL SHORTLY AFTER WE SWITCHED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD VENDORS TO A NEW INTEROPERABLE PLATFORM. THIS CHILD WAS SIX MONTHS OLD AND- PRESENTED WITH SEIZURES. AND THE PARENTS WERE NOT MEDICAL SKILLED WORK FROM NORTH CAROLINA AND NEW ONLY THAT THEIR CHILD HAD A HOLE IN THE CAR. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT MEDICATION- NAMES THAT THE CHILD SHOULD BE TAKEN DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THE RECENT EXAMS ARE STUDIES- THE SWITCHING OF OUR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD PLATFORM. IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A DAY OR TWO TO GET OUTSIDE RECORDS AND WE WOULD HAVE REPEATED A LOT OF THOSE- EXAMS. BUT BECAUSE OF OUR RECENT TRANSITION I WAS ABLE TO DOWNLOAD FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA. IN ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS RECORDS OF THE LAST ACT OF CARD AGREE ON PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY DOES THAT. INSIDE OF GENETIC STUDIES SENDING BOTH UNNECESSARY- PEOPLE KEPT ASKING AND ALSO PROVIDING BETTER CARE THAN THOSE INDIVIDUAL. BUT WITH THE EXCEPTION IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BUT BY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I PUBLISHED A STUDY WITH COLLEAGUES ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SHOWING THAT WE WERE EXCHANGING MILLIONS OF RECORDS ACROSS TWELVE HEALTH SYSTEMS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MANY OF WHICH COMPETED WITH EACH OTHER LIKE SUTTER KAISER. UC SAN FRANCISCO STANFORD WASHINGTON HOSPITAL. UC DAVIS AND OTHERS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN YES HE SAID DIEGO TWO. ALL OF THEIR STUDENT HOW RECORDS. BE INTEROPERABLE. THAT THE SYSTEM. AND 98% OF OUR- STUDENT NOW OUT HELP INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PROVIDERS CARING FOR THEM. SO THE FEDERAL STANDARDS THAT HAVE MADE THE CALL POSSIBLE ARE WORKING AND THEY'RE WORKING WELL AND THEN THEY CAN BOTH PRIVACY AND SECURITY. CENTRALIZING DATA IS NOT THE SOLUTION IT IS AN INCREASE CYBER STERN REST. WITHOUT MUCH ADDED BENEFITS. I'VE BEEN AT THE HEART OF THE CODE NINETEEN VACCINATION EFFORTS THAT ASSEMBLY SPEAKER DOCTOR WOULD LOOK THINKING ABOUT. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA WE DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE THE PUBLIC HELP LEVEL. FOR THE APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS THERE BETTER WAYS TO ADDRESS PERFECT FINALLY WANT TO WRAP UP BY MENTIONING. THAT I TREATED UNCONSCIOUS PATIENTS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT LIKE THE YOUNG WOMAN TESTIFIED ABOUT HER. JUVENILE DERMATOMYOSITIS. AND INCREASINGLY THESE PATIENTS HAVE OUTSIDE HELP INFORMATION AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF THESE FEDERAL STANDARDS. SO I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED TO DUPLICATE THE EXISTING FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH THE MODERNIZE. THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. WHICH HAS BEEN WOEFULLY LACKING AND THE DATA IS THERE WE WILL NOW ASSESS THE TECHNOLOGY- WILL SUPPORT IT BUT WE NEED TO INVEST IN RESOURCES AND SMART MINES TO ANALYZE. IT THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH NUMBER TO MOVE- TO ADAM ARE GONNA TO THOSE WOULD BE- IN SOME. OR OUR- BUT JUST YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND YOUR POSITION. MISTER MODERATOR.

ALL RIGHT HEARING NONE WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IT LOOKS LIKE- MISTER FLORA IS READY TO GO SOME MR FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR- JUST HAD A MINERAL COUPLE QUESTIONS OF THE ONE I THINK YOU CAN ADDRESS BUT- HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THERE IS LIKE A COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS TO THIS NEW HIV. AND I THINK- ONCE A CONTRACTOR HAS BEEN CHOSEN. TO DO THIS- HOW IS IT FUNDED AND WHO'S GOING TO MAINTAIN THE COST OF THAT H. ID. HOW THE FUNDED THROUGH THE STATE. FIRST OF ALL WE DO ENVISION- AND RFP PROCESS SO THERE WOULD BE AN OPEN BID FOR THIS. AND AS FAR AS HOW WE HOW WE FUND THIS- WHERE. WE'RE WORKING WE'RE WORKING ON THIS- I WILL SAY THAT THAT IN GENERAL- A LOT OF HEALTH INFORMATION. ORGANIZATIONS AND SUCH ARE GETTING SIGNIFICANT FUND THAT HAVE GOTTEN SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL RESERVE- FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THESE INITIATIVES AND SO I. DO ENVISION. THAT THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FEDERAL SUPPORT AS WELL. AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT AT HOW HOW WE FUND THIS- INITIALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT HOW WE FUND IT LONG TERM. IT'S ABOUT HOW IS THE CONCEPT OF BUILDING THIS THING- AND THEN FROM THERE WE WILL WE WILL LOOK TO DRAW DOWN SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING TO. FOR THE OPERATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION. AWESOME AND THEN SINCE I MEAN THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT THIS IS CURRENTLY PLAGUE OF THERE'S ALREADY A AN H. ID OUT THERE- WHAT DO WE HAVE SAY LIKE. I MEAN AS FAR AS IS THERE ANY THINGS ONCE IT. PUT IN PLACE. THAT WE CAN PROTECT AGAINST OVERLAY AND LIKE CONFLICTING DATA LIKE IS EVERYTHING IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ONE. HIV THAT'S HANDLING ALL OF THIS IS THAT OF A- A DUPLICATE OF SYSTEM. WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL IS TO GET HAVE SOMETHING THAT ISN'T DUPLICATIVE- I WOULD COUNTER THAT THE OPPOSITION SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE GOT GOOD COVERAGE OUT THERE. THE BAY AREA RIGHT NOW HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WHITE SPACE WHICH MEANS. IN MY WHICH MEANS. THAT THERE'S NO COVERAGE AT ALL THERE- AND THE RELIANCE ON FEDERAL NETWORKS DOESN'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT. WHAT GOES ON IN INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES. SO I APPRECIATE LIKE DOCTOR LONG HERS HAD A GREAT EXAMPLE HOW HOW HE THEY WERE ABLE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY IN NORTH CAROLINA. WELL NOT. EVERY SYSTEM AS ALLOWS ALLOWS FOR THAT IF THAT WAS THE CASE. I WOULDN'T BE HERE WITH THIS BILL TODAY- THERE THERE ARE. A WHOLE. MYRIAD OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PROVIDERS OUT THERE. IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO GET EVERYBODY FEEDING INFORMATION TO THE SAME PLACE. AND BE ABLE TO. BE ABLE TO DISSEMINATE THAT INFORMATION IN A TIMELY. MANNER THEN THEN THEN WE WHICH OUR GOAL. I LOVE IT I THINK THAT A- AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AN OFFICE BUILDING I MEAN WE NEED THAT RIGHT NOW UP AND DOWN THE STATE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO IF WE CAN GET THERE WITH THIS- I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS. I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THROUGH THIS AND I- TRUSTED CHILDRESS'S CONCERTS PROCEDURE. THANK YOU. HE WAS FOR A- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I THOUGHT THAT MISS KOREA WAS JUST ABOUT TO JUMP IN BUT MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE NOT. ALL RIGHT WELL I JUST WANTED TO SAY- JUST ONE QUICK THING I AM ACTUALLY SENT OUT EARLY- WITH THE CHAIR TO THE AUTHOR- THIS THIS BILL NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING- TO BE FAIR WHAT AT WHAT ALL WENT INTO A HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUT. SOMETHING TOGETHER WHERE ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER IN AN EFFICIENT EFFICIENT WAY INITIALLY WHEN I WAS EXPLAINING WHY SIGNED ONTO RIGHT AWAY- I SAID YOU KNOW JUST LIKE THE INTERNET INTERSTATE. HIGHWAY SYSTEM WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE ONE CITY IN ANOTHER CITY OR NEXT TO EACH OTHER THAT WE HAVE A ROAD THAT CONNECTS AND THAT IT WORKS- WHEN IT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY CONNECT. AND SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME WELL THAT'S A GOOD ANALOGY BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE THAT NETWORK WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS WE NEED CARS WE NEED PROVIDERS. AND WHILE I BELIEVE THAT MIGHT BE TRUE I WAS READING THROUGH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION LETTERS AND I NOTICED ONE OF THE OPPOSITION LETTERS FROM A VERY VERY LARGE- NETWORK- PRIDING THEMSELVES ON COMMUNICATING WITH- WITH- JUST A FEW THOUSAND OTHER FOLKS- AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF. WELL THERE ARE A LOT MORE PROVIDERS- OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR THE JUST A FEW A FEW THOUSAND WHICH THAT SAYS TO ME AS AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I TO BE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES WERE WERE THEY WERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVING A SYSTEM TO BUILD A REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS- AND FOR THAT REASON I KNOW THIS WORK ISN'T YET DONE ARE STILL A LOT MORE TO DO. AT THIS IS THE FIRST- COMMITTEE HEARING- IT'S GOT A LONG WAY TO GO TO GET TO THE PROCESS AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD. TO WORKING WITH- WITH DOCTOR WOULD THE CHAIRMAN- AS IT AS IT GOES THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A GREAT GREAT PRODUCT IT LOOKS LIKE- MISCREANTS GOT INSPIRATION- IT'S HOME GOING TO. TURN TO MISS CARILLO THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND APOLOGIES I WAS PRESENTING AND ANOTHER ON A OTHER BUILDING ANOTHER. WITHIN QUITE SURE BILL THIS WAS BY- YOU HAVE A THIRTY ONE- I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO YOU DOCTOR WOULD FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- AS I MENTIONED TO YOU. BEFORE IT'S IT SEEMS LIKE. WE HAVE A BETTER WAY TO TRACK A FED EX PACKAGE OR SOMETHING THAT GETS DELIVERED. ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEN WE DO AN IN TRACKING THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF. EVERYDAY PEOPLE WHO ARE DESERVING OF HEALTH CARE IN OUR STATE. SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTIVE AND I WOULD LOVE TO AUTHOR CO AUTHOR WITH YOU. WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME- IS. DURING THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS MUCH NEEDED ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY- EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT WHERE EVER YOU LIVE IN THE STATE. WHATEVER TYPE OF HEALTH CARE YOU HAVE THAT WE ARE CREATING THE TYPE OF SYSTEM. THAT ENSURES THAT. WE CAN FOLLOW THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. WELL SEEING IT NO OTHER COMMITTEE MATTER WITH THIS IS TO SPEAK OR TO ASK QUESTIONS SO DOCTOR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU I WOULD AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND I WANT TO THANK THE- SUPPORTERS AND THE OPPOSITION FOR THEIR THEIR COMMENTS AND I I'VE I VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THERE ARE INDEED A LOT OF NETWORKS OUT THERE AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE WAS A GARB OR VICE CHAIR HERE DESCRIBE IT IS THAT THEY JUST THEY'RE OUT THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT ALL COMMUNICATING WITH WELL WITH ONE ANOTHER. I DIDN'T COME TO THIS OVERNIGHT WE'VE HAD HEARINGS ON THIS WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD A COUPLE HEARINGS ON THIS. END WHERE I FIRST GOT STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I WAS MEETING WITH SOME EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS- HOSPITAL NOT FAR FROM HERE. TWENTY FIVE MILES. IS NEAR IS A MILE FROM ANOTHER HOSPITAL. AND IF SOMEBODY GOES FROM ONE HOSPITAL TO THE NEXT HOSPITAL. THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE THEIR DATA SYSTEMS HOW DO THEY COMMUNICATE WITH THE TELEPHONE AND A FAX MACHINE. I TALKED TO A LARGE SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I SAID SO HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE THERE ARE SOME OF THE BIG PLAYERS OUT THERE SO WILL ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE COMMUNICATE WITH. IS WITH THE TELEPHONE AND A FAX MACHINE AND AS I THINK I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WE CAN FOCUS IS REMINDS ME OF A PRINCE SONG YOU KNOW FEEL LIKE WE'RE GONNAPARTY LIKE IT'S NINETEEN NINETY NINE HERE. IT'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND WE WITH THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL RESOURCES OUT THERE. AND I'M I'M AT LEAST HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE OPPOSITION. RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S A PART OF IT BECAUSE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE SO WE CAN WE CAN DO WE CAN WORK WITH EQUITIES WE CAN GET THINGS TO COMMUNITIES THAT ABSOLUTELY NEED TO. KNOW SOME PLAYERS IN OUR HEALTH SYSTEM YOU KNOW HAVE A PERSPECTIVE THAT THE RECORDS ARE SOMEHOW THEIR INFORMATION. THEY'RE NOT THE RECORD IS THE PATIENTS INFORMATION AND THE PROVIDER IS THE CUSTODIAN OF THAT. IN THE SOMETIMES I AND I KNOW THIS TO BE THE CASE. THAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. THE REASON THEY HAVE HIS PERSPECTIVE. IS THAT THIS SYSTEM THEY HAVE PROTECT THEIR BUSINESS MODEL NOW WHAT WE SHOULD BE ASKED WE SHOULD BE ASKING IS WILL BE THE BEST SYSTEM FOR THE PATIENT. EASING COORDINATION OF TREATMENT AS WE HEARD FROM THE WITNESS THE PATIENT WITNESS. AS WELL AS UP TO THE STATE INTO IN TERMS OF CHEATING OR PUBLIC A PUBLIC HEALTH OBJECTIVES. HAVING PATIENTS INFORMATION IN REAL TIME CAN HELP THE STATE BETTER RESPOND TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS- LIKE COVE IT. LIKE POTENTIALLY WILDFIRES. IN THE PANDEMIC THAT WE'VE SEEN NOW SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES DR WORD- DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS. I DON'T REMEMBER THAT WE DID- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY AND MISS REAVIS SECONDS- WITH THAT THE MAN BURKE WOULD YOU A CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS THE PAST TWO APPROPRIATIONS WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES HI MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOU VERY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW NARROW BONTA. BURKE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL BILL I JUST WANT TO AGAIN I HAVE TO GO BACK SUBMIT AN ERROR EARLIER MENTIONED THAT- SO I NEED TO CORRECT THE MOTION ON A. B. SIX THIRTY EIGHT AND THE MOTION THE MOTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN DO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS INSTEAD OF DO PASS AS AMENDED SO HOPE THE RECORD CAN NOW REFLECT THE CORRECT MOTION SIR WE'LL HAVE THAT TO THE LIST OF THINGS I. MADE A MISTAKE ON TODAY. SO WITH THAT BEFORE I MAKE ANY MORE MISTAKES- LIKE TO MOVE TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO AB. FOUR SEVENTY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TIME PREVENTING AB FOR SEVENTY WHICH ALLOWS LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE MOST AT RISK OF COVER NINETEEN TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHILE MAINTAINING. THEIR DIGNITY AND FINANCIAL STABILITY BY ELIMINATING THE OUTDATED MEDICAL ASSETS TEST THANK YOU MEMBERS. AS WE ALL KNOW THE CURRENT MEDICAL OFFICE LIMITS WRONGFULLY PREVENT SENIORS FROM HAVING ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO WHETHER A CRISIS SUCH AN EVICTION A LEAKING ROOF FOR MAJOR. VEHICLE REPAIR ONCE AN ADULT TURN SIXTY FIVE AND BECOMES MEDICARE ELIGIBLE THEIR MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED BY THIS RESTRICTIVE. SET OF RULES THAT REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE MINIMAL ASSETS TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE. THE UNINTENDED RESULT IS THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REMAIN MEDICAL ELIGIBLE TO. DEPLETE ALL OF THE RESOURCES TO CONTINUE RECEIVING BENEFITS I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THE STORY OF AN OLDER ADULTS WHO HAVE AN ANNUAL INCOME OF SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED WHICH IS UNDER THE NON. AB MEDICAL CAL INCOME LIMIT- NON MHDI. UNFORTUNATELY THIS SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD WOMAN IT'S UNABLE TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAL DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE SHE TOOK A REVERSE MORTGAGE. ON HER HOME TO PAY FOR BASIC NECESSITIES AND TO MAKE. ESSENTIAL HOME REPAIRS THIS REVERSE MORTGAGE COMBINED WITH HER EXISTING ASSETS TOTALED. TO ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. CONSECUTIVELY TO SQUALLY HER DISQUALIFYING HER FOR MEDICAL SERVICES UNDER THE CURRENT ASSETS LIMIT AND LEAVING HER WITH ONLY ONE VIABLE OPTION. SPEND DOWN HER MONEY TO TWO THOUSAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY STORIES INDIVIDUALS FACING. SUCH CHALLENGES ANTIQUATED POLICIES LIKE THE MEDICAL AFTER TEST NOT ONLY PUTS INDIVIDUALS IN SUCH COMPROMISING POSITIONS BUT IT ALSO EXACERBATES. INEQUITY. FOR EXAMPLE MY PRIMARY RESIDENT IS EXEMPT IS AN EXEMPT ASSET BUT CASH SAVINGS IS COUNTED THIS MAY SOUND LIKE A NEUTRAL POLICY CHOICE BUT THERE ARE LARGE DISPARITIES. IN RATES OF HOMEOWNERSHIP MEANING THAT IT IS MUCH HARDER FOR HISPANIC OR LATINO OR BLACK CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS MEDICAL ADDITIONALLY THE ACID TEST PREVENT. LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM AMASSING ANY WHILE TO TRANSFER TO THEIR CHILDREN THIS WIDENING THE INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH TRANSFER AMONGST PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE'RE LIVING DURING A TIME OR OLDER ADULTS WITH PERSONS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE FACING HIGHER RISK OF COVER NINETEEN COMPLICATIONS. IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS TO NOT IMPOSE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS ISSUE. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY ON THE PHONE OR MISTER JOSEPH STILL LEANING. AND MISS CLEAR AROUND THING WITH JUSTICE IN AGING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR WITNESSES. INDIA LINES ARE OPEN FOR THEM. HELLO YES PLEASE GO AHEAD YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. JOSEPH DELANEY. HI JOSEPH GIULINI EIGHTY TWO I'M FROM LOS ANGELES ONE DIALYSIS WAS DENIED MEDICAL BECAUSE OF ASSETS. I'M BELOW POVERTY LEVEL INCOME MONTHLY I HAVE TO DIP INTO SAVINGS MONTHLY TO MAKE ENDS MEET I PAY ONE FORTY EIGHT FIFTY A MONTH FOR MEDICARE PART B. MEDI CAL WOULD PAY THAT. AND CLEANING SERVICES. PROVIDE DEPLETE MY SERVICES MY SAVINGS. I WOULD HAVE TO ABANDON MY CAR BECAUSE OF REPAIRS INSURANCE. I WOULD LOSE MY INDEPENDENCE AND REGRESSED TO A LESS THAN NORMAL LIFE. WE'LL BE NEEDING A NEW CAR SHORTLY. BUT DEPLETE MY SAVINGS KEEP THE CAR I WOULD LOSE MY APARTMENT AND BECOME HOMELESS. BUT LOSE MY SAVINGS I WOULD LOSE A NEST EGG FOR NURSING HOME INCLUDES EMERGENCY FUNDS. THIS COULD ALL BE RESOLVED IF I HAD MEDICARE HEALTH MEDICARE WOULD PAY THE ONE FORTY EIGHT FIFTY A MONTH FOR MEDICARE PART B. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER WARD DR WHAT EXCUSE ME AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CLAIRE RAMSEY AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH JUSTICE IN AGING. WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSOR ALONG WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY A BABY FOR SEVENTY. I'M THANKFUL THAT MR TRULY NEED TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW THE MEDICAL ASPECT AT DIRECTLY AND NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE FLIGHT. WHICH TO EASY PRETTY COMPLICATED POLICY THE BILL MARKETS AND PERSONAL. BUT BY ELIMINATING AFTER CONSULTING AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CALIFORNIA CAN TRULY A POSITIVELY IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES. ONLY BECAUSE THAT IN FOUR MAJOR WAGE. FIRST IT CREEK PARITY IN OUR MEDIC HEALTH PROGRAM. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MEDICARE RECIPIENTS. TEN POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE TO MEET AN ACID TEST AT ALL. HOWEVER EVERY ADULTS SIXTY FIVE AND OVER AND MANY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE STILL REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE LEFT IN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COUNTABLE ASSETS. FIFTEEN SUGGESTED YOU REACH A POINT IN YOUR LIFE FOR YOUR INCOME MAY BECOME SIX. OVER YOU MAY WANT TO HAVE TO STOP WORKING YOU MUST REDUCE YOUR ASSETS TO LEVELS THAT NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. AND THEN ENSURE YOU NEVER PAID MORE THAN THAT. BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU WILL LOSE MEDIC COW. SECOND THE BILL ADVANCES RACIAL AT. SURPRISING THE ROLE OF QUITE ALL ADULTS. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE THREE DIFFERENT THAT ACCERN ARE. DEGREE A PER PRIMARY BUT IS EXACTLY THE TO DOLLARS. A RECENT SURVEY SHOWS RACIAL GAPS IN HOMEOWNERSHIP IN TEMPERATURES GO 61% OF WHITE RESIDENTS ON HOME BUT ONLY 33% OF BLACK RESIDENTS DO IN LA IT'S 58% TO THIRTY THREE PERCENT. MEANS A WHITE PERSON WITH A LOW INCOME OF A MILLION DOLLAR HOME WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW AND A BLACK PERSON AT THE SAME INCOME IN TWO THOUSAND ONE DOLLARS IN THE BANK WILL NOT. ELIMINATING THE LIMIT THE STATE WOULD TAKE A BIG STEP FORWARD TOWARD RACIALLY. EQUITABLE ACCESS AND THAT ACCOUNT. THIRD TWO THOUSAND FIVE ADMINISTRATION OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. RIGHT NOW OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES MUST DOCUMENT AND PROVE THEIR ASSETS WHEN THEY APPLIED AND EVERY YEAR AFTER TO STAY INVOLVED IN THAT ACCOUNT. WE WILL PREPARE BUSINESS PROCESS ALL THIS PAPER AND REVIEW EVERYTHING WILL PAY TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. THIS IS BURDENS AND FOR EVERYONE. EVERY ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND COMPLICATION IN OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM DIRECTLY LEADS TO SOME PEOPLE. BEING DENIED OR LOSING THEIR MEDIC CAL. FOUR ONE. IT ENHANCE FINANCE STABILITY SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. FOR MANY PEOPLE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE. PEOPLE ARE TOLD THEY CAN ONLY HAVE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF THEY WANT TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID BE RATIONALLY SPEND DOWN. EVEN THOUGH THIS MAY BE THE ONLY MONEY THEY SAVED OVER THE WHOLE LIFETIME IN A CACHE OF A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY THEY PAID INTO FOR YEARS AND YEARS. THEY MAY SELL THE MUCH NEEDED HARD BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO MAINTAIN IT WITHOUT MARKETING. IN SHORT THEY'RE FORCED TO MAKE BAD INTO STABILIZE FINANCIAL DECISIONS JUST SO THEY CAN HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. BUT WE LIMIT THE MEDICAL ASPECT HAS BEEN PEOPLE CAN KEEP THEIR HARD EARNED SAVINGS CAN STAY HOW CAN FIX. THEIR CAR AND STILL HAVE NOT ACCOUNT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS I COULD YOU EITHER ON EIGHTY FOUR SEVEN. THANK YOU EVERYONE ELSE THINK ASSEMBLY CLEO FOR HER PASSIONATE THE- THIS. THANK YOU.
