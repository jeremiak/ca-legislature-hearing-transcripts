ACROSS ENTITIES. ITS

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:38.267
RECOMMENDATION BECOMES AN ISSUE

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:39.035
WHEN THE STATE WANTS TO

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:40.770
INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:41.804
FOR CHILDREN BUT IT'S NOT

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.005
ENTIRELY CLEAR WHAT THE BEST

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.507
APPROACH WOULD BE THE

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:46.142
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.443
TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING POP

01:05:58.287 --> 01:05:59.855
ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING TO

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:00.756
INCREASE SCHOOL BASED SERVICES

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.925
IS REASONABLE HOWEVER WE HAVE

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.093
SEVERAL CONCERTS WITH THE

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.028
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FIRST AND

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:06.929
FOR MOST OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.564
PROPOSAL LARGELY OVERLAPS AND

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.166
DUPLICATES OTHER SCHOOL MENTAL

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:11.233

FINANCE MENTIONED IN THIS

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.640
BUDGET THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO

GRANT PROGRAMS FOR COUNTY

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:22.511

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.380
EXISTING PARTNERSHIP GRANTS AND

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.648
THE MATCHING FUNDS SHARE MANY

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.049
SIMILARITIES. BOTH ARE

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:28.617
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:29.819

PARTNERSHIPS TO INCREASE SCHOOL

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:32.955
BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.323
THE MOST NOTABLE DIFFERENCE IS

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.558
THAT THE MATCHING FUNDS ARE

01:06:35.624 --> 01:06:37.860
ADMINISTERED BY CVG SCHOOLS

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:39.362

STATE COMMISSION TO COUNTIES AS

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.264
IS THE CASE WITH THE EXISTING

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:44.300
PARTNERSHIP GRANTS HOW THESE

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:45.201
PROPOSALS ARE INTENDED TO BE

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:46.902
COORDINATED IS UNCLEAR

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:47.737
ESPECIALLY SINCE NOTHING

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:48.904
PREVENTS DISTRICTS FROM

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:49.605
RECEIVING BOTH OF THE

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:50.706
PARTNERSHIP GRANT AND THE

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.007
MATCHING FUNDS WHICH WOULD

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.442
LIMIT OTHER DISTRICTS ACCESS TO

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:54.944
THESE BONDS. ADDITIONALLY

01:06:55.010 --> 01:07:00.316

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:00.850

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:01.417
HEALTH AND WELL BEING COULD

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:02.385
POLLACHI FOR MATCH FUNDS MAYBE

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:02.985

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:05.187
OTHER. FOR THANK YOU WE ARE. IF

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:06.122
THE MATCHING FUNDS WOULD

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:07.690
ULTIMATELY INCREASE COUNTY

CHILDREN'S SERVICES MEANING IT

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:16.899
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO KNOW

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:18.601
WHETHER THE PROPOSED TWENTY

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:19.535

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:21.871
KNEW COUNTY SPENDING OR MATCH

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:23.239
EXISTING FUNDS THAT ARE ALREADY

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:25.040
DEDICATED TO THESE SERVICES.

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:26.041
LASTLY WE HAVE SEVERAL

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:27.209
QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE LIKELY

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:29.445
IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL LARGELY

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:30.312
DUE TO THE LACK OF DETAIL

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:31.914
AVAILABLE. OUR UNDERSTANDING

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:32.848
THAT MANY OF THESE DETAILS

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.683

DECIDE. AS A RESULT IT'S-

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.423
UNCLEAR HOW APPLICATIONS WOULD

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.758
BE PRIORITIZED AND WHAT THE

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:43.426
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:44.860

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:46.495
IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY PRODUCTS

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.297
ARE LIKELY TO RECEIVE FINDING

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:49.932

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:50.866
EXPANDED SERVICES COULD BE

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:52.168
SUSTAINED WITHOUT MATCHING

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:53.769

APPLYING. IT IN OUR SYSTEM WE

01:07:58.574 --> 01:07:59.909

BY WHAT THE FUNDING COULD BE

FOR L. A.'S TO HIRE PERSONNEL.

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:36.218
IN NEARLY FROM L. A. L. I THINK

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:36.985
THEY WERE JUST HARKEN BACK TO

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:38.187
THE INITIAL COMMENTS THAT WE

01:12:38.253 --> 01:12:41.123
NEED- AND- ASSESSMENT- OUR

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.024
FINDINGS WAS THAT THERE WERE

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.492
ARE A FAIR NUMBER OF ENTITIES

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:44.560
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:45.160
PROVIDING CHILDREN'S MENTAL

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:46.929
HEALTH SERVICES THIS INCLUDES

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.430
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:49.031
ESPECIALLY AS FAR AS SPECIAL

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:51.100

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:53.068
INCLUDES- HEALTH PLANS BOTH

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:55.537
PRIVATE AND- MEDICAL OR

01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:58.107
MEDICARE. AND ALL OUR BACK CAL

01:12:58.173 --> 01:13:00.142
MOST LIKELY- AND ALSO COUNTY

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.510
HEALTH DEPARTMENT I THINK THE

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:02.678
CHALLENGING THING IS THERE'S NO

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:03.612
COORDINATION ACROSS THESE

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.013
ENTITIES AND SO IT'S HARD TO

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.248
UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR OT THERE

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:07.816
ARE GAPS SERVICE GAPS WHEN IT

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:08.917
COMES TO CHILDREN MENTAL HEALTH

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.619
SERVICES SO I THINK THAT IS

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:12.888
KIND OF WHY IT AT MOTIVATED OUR

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:13.689
RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE A

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.057

THE ISSUE AND THEN ALSO

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:22.598
CHARGING A CROSS AGENCY WORK
