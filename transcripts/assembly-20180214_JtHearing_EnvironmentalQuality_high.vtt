GOVERNING STATUTES TO CLEAN THEM

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.853 region:rollup2

LET ME TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THESE

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:11.398 region:rollup2
FIVE TOPICS. FIRST JUST THE

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.966 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND.

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:14.901 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW WE WERE CREATED IN

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:17.337 region:rollup2

FIFTEEN IN NOVEMBER AND WE HAD

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:38.291 region:rollup2

REQUESTS FOR WRITTEN REPORTS.

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:50.837 region:rollup2
GOT MANY PRESENTATIONS FROM THE

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.505 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. TWENTY FIVE. TOTAL

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:54.240 region:rollup2
TO ONE THE EXCITED NOW WOULD YOU

SO THE FIVE MAIN TOPICS TO

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:18.965 region:rollup2
IMPROVE. THE PROGRAMS AND THEN A

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.133 region:rollup2
SHORT CONCLUSION.

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:22.002 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THE CONTINUITY IN

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:23.370 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:26.206 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPERIENCED

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.174 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT TURNOVER AT FIVE

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:29.676 region:rollup2
DIRECTORS SINCE TWENTY TEN.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.111 region:rollup2
IN A PREVIOUS REPORT WE NOTED

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:33.179 region:rollup2
THAT THE FIFTEEN EXECUTIVE

00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:34.814 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP POSITIONS EIGHT WERE

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.585 region:rollup2
HIRED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. IT'S

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:40.453 region:rollup2
STILL NEW EXECUTIVE TEAM.

00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:42.956 region:rollup2
THE PTSD STAFF AGREE THAT THE

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:44.257 region:rollup2
TURNOVER AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL

00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:46.025 region:rollup2
HAS A PROBLEM IN A PROBLEM.

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:49.295 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:51.264 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE MORALE.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:52.665 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE'S GOOD NEWS THERE.

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:54.834 region:rollup2
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:57.670 region:rollup2
THERE IS A STABILIZED LEADERSHIP

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:58.304 region:rollup2
TEAM. THANKS TO DIRECTOR LEE.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.507 region:rollup2
WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR OVER THREE

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:03.009 region:rollup2
YEARS. OF THE FIFTEEN KARTLI TO

00:09:00.507 --> 00:09:04.611 region:rollup2
SHIP POSITIONS. ONLY ONE IS

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:07.680 region:rollup2
STAFFED BY A NEW HIRE ALTHOUGH

00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:09.182 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO COVERED VACANCIES.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.484 region:rollup2
THE NEXT LEVEL LEADERSHIP. THE

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:11.985 region:rollup2
SENIOR MANAGEMENT TWENTY NINE OF

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.920 region:rollup2
THIRTY ONE POSITIONS ARE

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:15.054 region:rollup2
STAFFED.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.290 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A BETTER STORY TO

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:19.559 region:rollup2
TELL THEIR.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.960 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE CONTINUITY AT

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:23.229 region:rollup2
THE TOP. BUT.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.531 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:27.133 region:rollup2
TO PAY ATTENTION TO. ESPECIALLY

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:28.501 region:rollup2
AS ADMINISTRATIONS CHANGE ALSO

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:31.071 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN AGING WORKFORCE TO

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:32.505 region:rollup2
DGSE. FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.773 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES ARE FIFTY ONE YEARS

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:35.475 region:rollup2
OLD.

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:37.677 region:rollup2
TO BE A WAVE OF RETIREMENTS

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:39.712 region:rollup2
AHEAD. THAT'S OPPORTUNITY BUT

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:41.748 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO A CHALLENGE LOSING

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:42.982 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:44.751 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP MATTERS. AND YOU ALL

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:47.654 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:49.856 region:rollup2
POINT TO.

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:51.691 region:rollup2
HUMAN RESOURCES.

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:53.560 region:rollup2
THE IRB STRONGLY FEELS THAT

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:56.329 region:rollup2
EVALUATING AND INSTITUTING

00:09:53.560 --> 00:10:00.333 region:rollup2
CHANGES THE DTS THESE INTERNAL

00:09:56.329 --> 00:10:02.602 region:rollup2
CULTURE IS CRITICAL.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.937 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT UNDERSTANDS THIS.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.605 region:rollup2
BEGINNING AT TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:07.707 region:rollup2
EMBARKED ON AN ORGANIZATIONAL

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS A DOCUMENT

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:13.847 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE.

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:16.115 region:rollup2
IN NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN DTS

00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:18.418 region:rollup2

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:20.620 region:rollup2

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:23.723 region:rollup2

DEVELOPMENT PLANS HAVE NOT BEEN

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:31.798 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.766 region:rollup2
THE NEW HIRING IN RECRUITMENT

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:38.204 region:rollup2
BETTER EMPLOYEE RECOGNITION.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:39.939 region:rollup2
PEER MENTORING AND BEST

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:41.207 region:rollup2
PRACTICES FOR PROJECT PLANNING.

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:43.910 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:44.511 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE METRICS TO MONITOR

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.645 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE DOING WITH ALL OF

00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.946 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:49.415 region:rollup2
WE AGREE THERE SHOULD BE A

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:50.950 region:rollup2
PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:52.952 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN THE FUTURE BUDGETS AND

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.687 region:rollup2
FUTURE LEADERSHIP HAVE TO MAKE

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:56.222 region:rollup2
THAT A PRIORITY.

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:59.392 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IMPROVING THE

00:10:56.222 --> 00:11:03.029 region:rollup2
CULTURE AN HR ADJUST DEPARTMENT.

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:04.998 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A PRIORITY.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:08.368 region:rollup2
NEXT.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:08.968 region:rollup2
THREE STABLE FISCAL RESOURCES.

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:10.737 region:rollup2
IT STARTS ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:12.172 region:rollup2
OUR REPORT.

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:14.641 region:rollup2
FUNDING IN INFLATION ADJUSTED

INCREASED RESPONSIBILITIES WITH

SOME CHARTS SHOWING THIS AS WELL

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:23.716 region:rollup2
AS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:27.520 region:rollup2

LARGEST FUNDING SOURCES FACE

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:43.736 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL DEFICITS.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.838 region:rollup2

ACCOUNT THE H. WCA.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:53.680 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM S EXPECTED TO

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:55.915 region:rollup2
CONTINUE. BASED ON PROJECTED

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.650 region:rollup2
REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:59.085 region:rollup2

RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:12:08.094 --> 00:12:10.763 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS YEAR THE COST OR

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:13.232 region:rollup2
COMMITMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:15.468 region:rollup2
EXCEED OUR APPROPRIATIONS. THAT

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:18.805 region:rollup2

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:28.915 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET ACT ELIMINATED THE

HOWEVER.

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:35.321 region:rollup2
THE REGULATED COMMUNITY IS

00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:37.523 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED UNHAPPINESS WITH THE

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:52.965 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR INDICATED THAT

RESOURCES. AND FUNDING THAT IS

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.379 region:rollup2

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:08.314 region:rollup2
FUNDING IS IMPORTANT.

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:10.383 region:rollup2
BUT A RELATED ISSUE THEREFORE IS

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:13.619 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:15.321 region:rollup2

TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:21.027 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:22.528 region:rollup2
FOR ALL OF US.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:25.031 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE

ASSURANCES TO YOU.

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:32.705 region:rollup2
BUT THE RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:34.307 region:rollup2
SUPPORT GOOD INVESTMENTS.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:36.476 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:37.543 region:rollup2

00:14:36.476 --> 00:14:39.212 region:rollup2
ONGOING INITIATIVES THAT I'VE

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:41.114 region:rollup2
BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:46.219 region:rollup2
AND FRANKLY IT'S DECISION MAKING

00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:48.621 region:rollup2
ON PROJECTS LIKE EXILE.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:50.523 region:rollup2
THE TSC. HAS A HISTORY OF

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:52.492 region:rollup2
MISSING DEADLINES. OFTEN SELF

00:14:50.523 --> 00:14:54.794 region:rollup2
IMPOSED DEADLINES THAT ARE NOT

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:56.729 region:rollup2
REALISTIC. THERE'S A LONG LIST

00:14:54.794 --> 00:14:59.732 region:rollup2
OF THESE ON PAGE TWENTY EIGHT OF

00:14:56.729 --> 00:15:01.567 region:rollup2

HASN'T BEEN DONE.

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:22.422 region:rollup2
THEY ARE BIG KNOWLEDGE IS.

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:25.992 region:rollup2
THAT INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES PLAY

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:28.394 region:rollup2
A ROLE IN MISSTEP ONCE.

00:15:25.992 --> 00:15:30.963 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE DTS HE CAN DO

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:32.465 region:rollup2
MORE. TO SET REALISTIC DEADLINES

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:35.768 region:rollup2
AND CONSIDER HOW TO ACHIEVE A

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:37.503 region:rollup2
BALANCE BETWEEN TIMELINESS. AND

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:39.772 region:rollup2
GOOD WORK PRODUCT YOU HAVE TO

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:41.340 region:rollup2
HAVE BOTH.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:43.810 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IF THE GOVERNOR AND

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:46.679 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THE DTS IS DOING HIGH

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.313 region:rollup2
QUALITY WORK ON TIME. YOU'LL BE

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.948 region:rollup2
MORE LIKELY TO GIVE THE

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:51.951 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THE BENEFIT OF THE

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:54.353 region:rollup2
DOUBT WHEN RESOURCES ARE NEEDED.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:56.322 region:rollup2
SO.

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:56.889 region:rollup2
DESPITE RECENT IMPROVEMENTS.

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.357 region:rollup2
WHICH WE DO IT KNOWLEDGE FOR

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:59.592 region:rollup2
SURE.

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:01.327 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BUSINESS IN LOCAL

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:02.929 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT STAKE HOLDERS STILL

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:04.096 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH WORK TO

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:06.632 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE DONE. IN TERMS OF

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:07.500 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.235 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY IS EXPRESSED

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.503 region:rollup2
DISSATISFACTION WITH PROPOSED

PERMIT APPLICATION SERVICE FEES

00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:21.414 region:rollup2
AND CHARGES FRIEND DIRECT COSTS.

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:22.782 region:rollup2
WHAT COUNTY? AND SUPERVISOR SO

00:16:21.414 --> 00:16:24.183 region:rollup2
WE SIT HERE TODAY. HAS

00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:26.552 region:rollup2
CRITICIZED ELEMENTS OF THE EXXON

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:28.654 region:rollup2
CLEANUP.

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:30.857 region:rollup2
FIRST SANTA SUSANNA CONSIDER

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:32.558 region:rollup2
STORMS DISTRICT. AND AGAIN THIS

00:16:30.857 --> 00:16:35.027 region:rollup2
IS FROM A FARM THIS PERSON'S

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:36.295 region:rollup2
OPINION. IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME.

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:38.531 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE RELEASE OF THE

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:40.833 region:rollup2
RECENT DRAFTEE I ARE IS REALLY

00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:43.903 region:rollup2
GOING TO PROVE. A SIGNIFICANT

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:46.172 region:rollup2
STEP FORWARD.

00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:47.907 region:rollup2
NOW. THE I RP WAS AN ENTITY THAT

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:50.209 region:rollup2
STAKE HOLDERS COULD APPROACH TO

00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:53.346 region:rollup2
EXPRESS CONCERNS ASK QUESTIONS

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:55.715 region:rollup2
AND LEARN. BUT WE ARE GONE NOW.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:57.817 region:rollup2
SO THE PANEL MEMBERS TO WONDER

00:16:55.715 --> 00:17:00.353 region:rollup2
WHERE STAKEHOLDERS WILL GO. IN

00:16:57.817 --> 00:17:02.321 region:rollup2
THE ABSENCE OF THE IRP. AND WHO

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:04.257 region:rollup2
ON A REGULAR BASIS. IS GOING TO

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:05.424 region:rollup2
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF ALL

00:17:04.257 --> 00:17:07.793 region:rollup2
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:09.128 region:rollup2
METRICS.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:11.197 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:12.899 region:rollup2
AGREES ISSUED A REPORT IN APRIL

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:14.233 region:rollup2

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:15.935 region:rollup2
THAT CONTINUED OVERSIGHT IS

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:17.003 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

00:17:15.935 --> 00:17:18.170 region:rollup2
THE R. P. HAS MADE

00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:21.107 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ALONG THESE

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.575 region:rollup2
LINES.

00:17:21.107 --> 00:17:24.477 region:rollup2
INCLUDING. THE GREAT AN

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:26.879 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT BOARD OR OTHER

00:17:24.477 --> 00:17:27.313 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL CHANGE TOIMPROVE

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:32.251 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND

00:17:27.313 --> 00:17:33.953 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY.

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:35.321 region:rollup2
FINALLY PARTY FIVE. THE

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:36.689 region:rollup2
GOVERNING STATUTES THAT MAY NEED

00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:38.591 region:rollup2
REVISION OR REPEAL AND HEALTH

00:17:36.689 --> 00:17:40.459 region:rollup2
AND SAFETY CODE.

00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:42.662 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE REVIEWED TO IMPROVE

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:44.497 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION LEMONADE OBSOLETE

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:45.932 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS AND STRENGTHEN SOME

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:47.533 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS THAT ARE NOT WORKING

00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:49.268 region:rollup2
PROPERLY. I CAN JUST TOUCH

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:51.404 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY ON ONE AND THEN I'LL

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:53.105 region:rollup2
CONCLUDE.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:54.874 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTIONS

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:56.442 region:rollup2
TWO FIVE ONE THREE FIVE. THROUGH

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:58.077 region:rollup2
POINT NINE.

00:17:56.442 --> 00:18:00.046 region:rollup2
ARE EXAMPLES OF A STATUTE THAT

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:02.248 region:rollup2
ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY.

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:04.650 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO. THESE ESTABLISHED A

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:06.218 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT TO PRODUCE A STATE

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.087 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN.

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:11.023 region:rollup2
BUT NINETEEN NINETY ONE.

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:11.591 region:rollup2
IT WAS TO BE REVIEWED ANNUALLY

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:13.359 region:rollup2
AND REVISED ONCE EVERY THREE

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:14.493 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:16.095 region:rollup2
IT WAS TO BE PREPARED

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:17.563 region:rollup2
CONJUNCTION WITH PLANTS ADOPTED

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:19.298 region:rollup2
BY COUNTIES AND REGIONAL

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:21.467 region:rollup2
COUNCILS.

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:22.468 region:rollup2
BUT. SOMETIMES THE PLANS WERE

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:24.804 region:rollup2
AND SUBMITTED OR THEY COULD NOT

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:27.006 region:rollup2
BE APPROVED.

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:27.840 region:rollup2
SO AS A RESULT THE STATE WIDE

00:18:27.006 --> 00:18:29.208 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS WASTE PLANNING

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.410 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:33.346 region:rollup2
BE.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.781 region:rollup2
THE SECTION SHOULD BE REPLACED

00:18:33.346 --> 00:18:37.149 region:rollup2
BY A NEW PLANNING PROCESS.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:38.884 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:39.518 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS. AND IT REALLY

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:40.853 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE YOU ON

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:42.855 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:45.024 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:47.560 region:rollup2
MANAGE TREAT DISPOSE OF ITS

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:49.528 region:rollup2
WASTE WITHOUT SHIPPING IT TO

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.163 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES OR COUNTRIES.

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:53.833 region:rollup2
THIS IS OUR OBLIGATION AS A

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:56.068 region:rollup2
STATE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR WASTE.

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:58.004 region:rollup2
SIR ISSUE OF FAIRNESS AND OF OUR

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:59.005 region:rollup2
MIDDLE JUSTICE.

00:18:58.004 --> 00:19:01.040 region:rollup2
BUT THE RESPONSIBLE WAY TO

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:03.409 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH THIS IS TO THINK

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.877 region:rollup2
STATE WHAT TO THINK FAIRLY.

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:06.712 region:rollup2
DECIDE THESE FACILITIES IN A WAY

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:09.582 region:rollup2
THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:10.983 region:rollup2
OUR STATE DO NOT ALWAYS BEAR. A

00:19:09.582 --> 00:19:13.219 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:14.720 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES PLANNING PROBABLY

00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:16.322 region:rollup2
SOME NEW STATUTORY AUTHORITY.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.324 region:rollup2
AND FUNDING.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.425 region:rollup2
BUT ANY OF IT.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:22.094 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNING STATUTES WILL

00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:23.662 region:rollup2
CREATE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS.

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:25.564 region:rollup2
AND HELP THE TSC FOCUS ON ITS

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:27.733 region:rollup2
MISSION.

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:29.969 region:rollup2
SO IN BRIEF CONCLUSION DGSE HAS

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:31.303 region:rollup2
MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS OVER

00:19:29.969 --> 00:19:32.772 region:rollup2
THESE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS.

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:34.840 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR.

00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:36.575 region:rollup2
INDEED HE IS THE DIRECTOR WE

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.245 region:rollup2
STABILIZE THE LEADERSHIP TEAM.

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:41.113 region:rollup2
PTSD IS WORKING. TO EVALUATE ITS

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:42.748 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE. AND YOUR

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:44.984 region:rollup2
BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS HAVE MADE A

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:46.852 region:rollup2
REAL DIFFERENCE FOR COST

00:19:44.984 --> 00:19:47.953 region:rollup2
RECOVERY. PERMITTING.

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.822 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:51.323 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY FOR EXIDE.

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:51.857 region:rollup2
AND THE PROBLEM IS WORKING ON

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:54.627 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE MATRIX IN OUR

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:56.762 region:rollup2
REPORT.

00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:58.164 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE.

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:59.965 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT IS ONLY BEGINNING

00:19:58.164 --> 00:20:01.634 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER AND IMPLEMENT ITS

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:03.536 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL PLANS.

00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:05.471 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THESE TWO SERIOUS

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:07.606 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL DEFICITS.

00:20:05.471 --> 00:20:09.341 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT YET CERTAIN WHETHER DTS

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:12.111 region:rollup2
SEES PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:16.582 region:rollup2
AJ WORK WILL REALLY LEAD TO IN

00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:18.317 region:rollup2
DURING IMPROVEMENTS.

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:20.686 region:rollup2
THERE'S STILL A REAL CHALLENGE.

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:21.854 region:rollup2
BETWEEN BALANCING WORK PRODUCT.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:24.390 region:rollup2
QUALITY.

00:20:21.854 --> 00:20:26.459 region:rollup2
AND TIMELINESS.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.161 region:rollup2
SO IN LIGHT OF ALL THIS.

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:30.896 region:rollup2
LEAVE THERE'S A CONTINUED NEED.

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:32.598 region:rollup2
TO ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY.

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:33.099 region:rollup2
REGULARLY MONITOR HOW THE

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:35.735 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS DOING WITH

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:37.903 region:rollup2
METRICS.

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:39.738 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS TO INQUIRE INTO ITS

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:41.474 region:rollup2
ONGOING. FINISHES AND DECISION

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:43.008 region:rollup2
MAKING.

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:44.477 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT OF COURSE. IS YOUR

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:45.911 region:rollup2
ROLE.

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:47.613 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR LETTING US SPEAK

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:50.182 region:rollup2
TO YOU TODAY. THIS OPPORTUNITY

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:51.383 region:rollup2
CHAIRS. AND I'M CERTAINLY

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:52.485 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO ANSWER A FEW

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:53.085 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OF MY VOICE CAN HOLD

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:55.287 region:rollup2
UP.

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:56.589 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:58.424 region:rollup2
LET'S START OFF AT THE END WHERE

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:59.658 region:rollup2
YOU CONCLUDED.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:01.627 region:rollup2
WITH A NEW FRAMEWORK.

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:03.996 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW SOME SOURCE

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:05.431 region:rollup2
REDUCTION CAN YOU FLESH THAT OUT

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:07.399 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT MORE WHAT THAT.

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:10.035 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE I MEAN I I SEE THE

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:11.604 region:rollup2
ONE SIDE IS A TEDIOUS CODE WORK

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:13.472 region:rollup2
TO LOOK FOR REDUNDANCIES AND GO

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:16.475 region:rollup2
OVER. THIRTY YEARS OF.

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:19.111 region:rollup2
OF FINE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:21.781 region:rollup2
PRIDE BUT WHAT TO HOW HUGE IS

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:23.482 region:rollup2
THAT. NEW FRAMEWORK.

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:26.252 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION.

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:28.053 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING.

00:21:26.252 --> 00:21:30.289 region:rollup2
IT. SO IT.

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:30.489 region:rollup2
I GUESS THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.824 region:rollup2
THERE.

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:33.125 region:rollup2
.

00:21:31.824 --> 00:21:35.528 region:rollup2
.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:38.030 region:rollup2
THE.

00:21:35.528 --> 00:21:39.598 region:rollup2
THE FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT THE.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.267 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THE HEALTH.

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:43.235 region:rollup2
SAFETY CODE.

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:45.304 region:rollup2
EXCERPTS.

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:46.138 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU CAN. YOU CAN FIND YOU

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:48.340 region:rollup2
KNOW RIGHT HERE.

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:49.008 region:rollup2
.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.143 region:rollup2
TO HAVE HAPPENED THROUGH THE

00:21:49.008 --> 00:21:52.611 region:rollup2
YEARS AT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:54.446 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS ACTUALLY

00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:55.781 region:rollup2
ARE QUITE SMALL IN COMPARISON TO

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:57.516 region:rollup2
THE CODE.

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:59.418 region:rollup2
WHAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN THROUGH THE

00:21:57.516 --> 00:22:01.720 region:rollup2
YEARS IS THAT THERE'S BEEN?

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:03.689 region:rollup2
THROUGH ACCRETION.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.658 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR. A NEW ISSUE A NEW

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:07.660 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE HAS BEEN DETERMINED

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:09.228 region:rollup2
FOR THE DEPARTMENT IT'S BEEN PUT

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.163 region:rollup2
IN THE LEGISLATION.

00:22:09.228 --> 00:22:13.199 region:rollup2
BUT AS A RESULT MAYBE TO DEAL

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:14.934 region:rollup2
WITH THE NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:22:13.199 --> 00:22:17.870 region:rollup2
OR. OTHER.

00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:20.940 region:rollup2
MERGING ISSUES. YOU GET A CODE

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.607 region:rollup2
THAT IS THIS. LARGE.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.809 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS CROSS

00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:25.477 region:rollup2
REFERENCE THEY'RE OBSOLETE

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:27.146 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THE HAZARDOUS WASTE.

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:29.748 region:rollup2
ABOUT PLANNING STATUTES THAT ARE

00:22:27.146 --> 00:22:31.283 region:rollup2
REFERENCED. AND. IT BECOMES

00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:33.219 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFICULT EITHER FROM YOU

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:35.688 region:rollup2
KNOW LAWYERS TO TO TRULY

00:22:33.219 --> 00:22:37.423 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND. SO IT'S A VERY VERY

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:39.325 region:rollup2
LARGE JOB TO DO THAT MAYBE IT IS

00:22:37.423 --> 00:22:41.827 region:rollup2
SOMETHING. THAT FRANKLY IN THE

00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:42.928 region:rollup2
END PROVED TO BE. INFEASIBLE BUT

00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:45.798 region:rollup2
WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT

00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:47.066 region:rollup2
THE. LAW REVISION COMMISSION OR

00:22:45.798 --> 00:22:49.001 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY VERY SMART.

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:50.669 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY BE LOCKED

00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:52.171 region:rollup2
IN A ROOM FOR A FEW MONTHS IN

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:54.506 region:rollup2
AND TRIED TO YOU KNOW SHRINK

00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:55.808 region:rollup2
THIS DOWN. SO THAT CROSS

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:57.076 region:rollup2
REFERENCES AND IT'S.

00:22:55.808 --> 00:23:00.946 region:rollup2
BETTER.

00:22:57.076 --> 00:23:02.915 region:rollup2
.

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:04.617 region:rollup2
EASIER TO MANAGE.

00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:05.885 region:rollup2
THE SECOND ISSUE IS ABOUT THE

00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:08.220 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE. I THINK IT'S RELATED

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:09.889 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.490 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN. ISSUES AT THE

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:13.025 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THE REASONS

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.227 region:rollup2
WE DISCUSSED IN THE FIVE

00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:16.996 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES IN OUR REPORT.

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:18.998 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN I THINK. PERHAPS

00:23:16.996 --> 00:23:20.466 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OFFIGURING OUT IN THIS

00:23:18.998 --> 00:23:21.767 region:rollup2
GOES BACK TO THE HISTORY OF THE

00:23:20.466 --> 00:23:23.168 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WHICH CAME OUT OF THE

00:23:21.767 --> 00:23:25.638 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANY

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:26.472 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO. THAT MAYBE MAYBE THE

00:23:25.638 --> 00:23:27.539 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

00:23:26.472 --> 00:23:30.476 region:rollup2
.

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:34.313 region:rollup2
YEAH.

00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:37.917 region:rollup2
AS. THE NEED.

00:23:34.313 --> 00:23:38.484 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMINERS. MAYBE WHAT USED

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:40.986 region:rollup2
TO BE MORE OF A PERMITTING

00:23:38.484 --> 00:23:42.688 region:rollup2
AGENCY IS NOT REALLY MORE OF A

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:44.723 region:rollup2
SITE CLEANUP AGENCY. WITH

00:23:42.688 --> 00:23:46.425 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER CONCERNED

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:47.993 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALL THE SITES UP AND DOWN

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:49.828 region:rollup2
THE STATE IN MAYBE THE STRUCTURE

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:51.463 region:rollup2
THAT WORKED WHAT WAS SPLIT OFF

00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:53.499 region:rollup2
IN THE NINETIES FROM D. PH. OR

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:55.668 region:rollup2
THE EIGHTIES ISN'T WHAT IT

00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:56.802 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE TODAY.

00:23:55.668 --> 00:23:58.771 region:rollup2
MAYBE INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:59.838 region:rollup2
THOSE STRUCTURAL ISSUES.

00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:02.007 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT A SWITCHER IS DONE

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:04.777 region:rollup2
INSTEAD IS ADD A DISPATCHER THAT

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:05.311 region:rollup2
STATUTE?

00:24:04.777 --> 00:24:06.478 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE NOW TWENTY YEARS

00:24:05.311 --> 00:24:07.846 region:rollup2
LATER.

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:10.049 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT REALLY WHERE YOU WANT

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:10.816 region:rollup2
TO BE. WHERE MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A

00:24:10.049 --> 00:24:12.451 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THAT PERHAPS DOESN'T

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:14.420 region:rollup2
FIT? WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.920 region:rollup2
DOING? THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.256 region:rollup2
THIS CODE. THAT IS VERY

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.857 region:rollup2
UNWIELDY.

00:24:17.256 --> 00:24:20.893 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE A SILVER BULLET FOR

00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:22.294 region:rollup2
YOU WANT BUT THE BEST STRUCTURE

00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:25.097 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE.

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:26.398 region:rollup2
UP. THERE IS A CONCERN THAT ALL

00:24:25.097 --> 00:24:28.901 region:rollup2
THE WORK WE'VE HAD ALL THESE

00:24:26.398 --> 00:24:30.202 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:32.137 region:rollup2
YOU WANNA WORST CASE IS JUST

00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:33.939 region:rollup2
GONNA BE ANOTHER REPORT IT'S PUT

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:35.507 region:rollup2
ON THE SHELF THAT NOBODY READS

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:38.210 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S BEEN SO MANY REPORTS

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:39.912 region:rollup2
ON THIS DEPARTMENT. AND WE DON'T

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.946 region:rollup2
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

00:24:39.912 --> 00:24:43.148 region:rollup2
AND THERE WAS NOT CONSENSUS

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:44.917 region:rollup2
AMONG THE PANEL WHAT WOULD BE

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.752 region:rollup2
THE BEST STRUCTURE. BUT THERE

00:24:44.917 --> 00:24:49.588 region:rollup2
ARE THINGS THAT. IT WOULD MAKE

00:24:46.752 --> 00:24:50.923 region:rollup2
SENSE TO HANDLE IN A.

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:52.224 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT WAITED DOESN'T EXIST

00:24:50.923 --> 00:24:54.259 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:57.463 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A FUNDAMENTALLY

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:59.098 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT. CORE MISSION TO

00:24:57.463 --> 00:24:59.665 region:rollup2
PERMIT SITES THAT ARE HANDLING

00:24:59.098 --> 00:25:02.368 region:rollup2
YOUR WAIST AND THEN DEALING

00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:03.736 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:05.237 region:rollup2
THE REPERCUSSIONS OF ALL THAT

00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:06.839 region:rollup2
HANDLING OF WASTED MAYBE THE

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:09.007 region:rollup2
MISHANDLING OF THE WAYS THAT'S

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:11.043 region:rollup2
CREATED. CONTAMINATION AND

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:12.444 region:rollup2
HAZARDS ON THOSE SITES AGAIN I

00:25:11.043 --> 00:25:13.712 region:rollup2
THINK IT GETS BACK TO THE YEAR

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:17.583 region:rollup2
THE LARGER QUESTION THAT YOU

00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:18.817 region:rollup2
HAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW. EVERYBODY

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:20.119 region:rollup2
IN MODERN CALIFORNIA.

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:21.520 region:rollup2
EXPECT CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:23.422 region:rollup2
EXPECTS CERTAIN A CERTAIN

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.424 region:rollup2
STANDARD OF LIVING DECREASE JUST

00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:27.059 region:rollup2
WASTES NO WE CAN WORK ON THAT

00:25:25.424 --> 00:25:29.695 region:rollup2
THAT ONE SIDE TO REDUCE THE

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:31.230 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF CREATING WAYS BUT WHAT

00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:33.298 region:rollup2
WE DO THAT I MEAN I. HAVE SAID

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:35.200 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY. AND AGREE WITH YOU

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:36.502 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.437 region:rollup2
RECYCLE OUR BATTERIES HERE IN

00:25:36.502 --> 00:25:40.105 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE ANSWER

00:25:38.437 --> 00:25:42.374 region:rollup2
IS NOT JUST TO SHIP THEM OUT.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:44.009 region:rollup2
OUT NOW. IS CERTAINLY VERNON

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:45.244 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WANT A SITE BECAUSE THEY

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:47.246 region:rollup2
FEEL THEY'VE HAD THE SITE AT

00:25:45.244 --> 00:25:49.314 region:rollup2
EXCITE BUT WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL

00:25:47.246 --> 00:25:51.617 region:rollup2
WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:53.552 region:rollup2
MODERN SOCIETY AND AND AS I MAKE

00:25:51.617 --> 00:25:54.453 region:rollup2
A LAW THAT SAYS THIS IS NOW

00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:56.288 region:rollup2
COULD BE HAZARDOUS WASTE PRODUCT

00:25:54.453 --> 00:25:57.523 region:rollup2
IN. CALIFORNIA I DON'T ALWAYS

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:59.458 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHERE IS IT GOING TO

00:25:57.523 --> 00:26:01.927 region:rollup2
GO AND WHAT'S THE TREATMENT OF

00:25:59.458 --> 00:26:03.262 region:rollup2
THAT SO UNIT. IS THAT WHAT WE

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:06.331 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IS THIS

00:26:03.262 --> 00:26:09.001 region:rollup2
WHOLE RESTRUCTURING OF THAT THE

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:10.803 region:rollup2
HELL WE HANDLE WASTE INSTEAD OF

00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:13.038 region:rollup2
JUST SAYING GET IT OUT OF MY YOU

00:26:10.803 --> 00:26:13.439 region:rollup2
KNOW. OFF AT THIS LOCATION AND

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:14.540 region:rollup2
PUT IT SOMEWHERE.

00:26:13.439 --> 00:26:16.608 region:rollup2
IF THAT SEEMS TO BE THE THE

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.077 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE A WAY TO ADDRESS IT

00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:20.712 region:rollup2
AND.

00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:23.949 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN SO CAUGHT

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:26.452 region:rollup2
UP IN. THE DAY TO DAY WHETHER

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:29.855 region:rollup2
IT'S EXIDE SAID TO SUSANNAH.

00:26:26.452 --> 00:26:31.690 region:rollup2
HUNTERS POINT. AND TRYING TO

00:26:29.855 --> 00:26:33.525 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THESE.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.993 region:rollup2
VERY EXISTENCE FROM STANCES THAT

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:37.129 region:rollup2
I I THINK IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:38.363 region:rollup2
STEP BACK AND DO SOME OF THIS

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:40.199 region:rollup2
PLANNING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:41.967 region:rollup2
ARE POOR TALKS ABOUT IS THAT THE

00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:43.535 region:rollup2
SOURCE REDUCTION EFFORTS. HAVE

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:45.938 region:rollup2
FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE A LITTLE

00:26:43.535 --> 00:26:47.906 region:rollup2
BIT AS OTHER PRIORITIES HAVE

00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:49.174 region:rollup2
BEEN PUT IN THIS CODE SO I THINK

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:51.477 region:rollup2
STEPPING BACK AND GIVING THE

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:52.778 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. AND THE LEGISLATURE.

00:26:51.477 --> 00:26:54.246 region:rollup2
IN THE ABILITY TO BREATHE A

00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:55.848 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT AND FIGURE OUT. WHERE

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:58.617 region:rollup2
ARE WE GOING WITH THIS IS THIS

00:26:55.848 --> 00:27:00.052 region:rollup2
THE BEST? WAY TO HANDLE IT I

00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:01.320 region:rollup2
THINK IS THE RESPONSIBLE THING.

00:27:00.052 --> 00:27:01.720 region:rollup2
BUT GOING BACK AGAIN TO YOUR

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.321 region:rollup2
QUESTION ON WHAT A

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.857 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE-COULD LOOK LIKE SOME

00:27:02.321 --> 00:27:06.225 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT

00:27:04.857 --> 00:27:07.359 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER IS.

00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:10.162 region:rollup2
NO REGULATIONS.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:12.397 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY COMMON FOR GOVERNING

00:27:10.162 --> 00:27:16.935 region:rollup2
BOARDS TO HAVE REGULATORY

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:16.935 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY IN PUBLIC TO CONSIDER.

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:20.038 region:rollup2
YOU HAD A GOVERNING BOARD WITH

00:27:18.237 --> 00:27:22.074 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY. WHICH WE CERTAINLY

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:24.076 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE. THESE REGULATIONS

00:27:22.074 --> 00:27:26.478 region:rollup2
ON SIX SEVENTY THREE WOULD BE

00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:28.380 region:rollup2
DONE BY NOW. EARN THE METRICS

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:30.315 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE INTERNAL THINGS THAT

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.849 region:rollup2
THE R. P. PUT TOGETHER THAT

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:33.552 region:rollup2
COULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:34.586 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT. CERTAINLY EXIDE WHICH

00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:35.954 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO GO ON FOR MANY MANY

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:36.421 region:rollup2
YEARS TO DO THAT IN A

00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:39.791 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT WAY. WITH

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:42.661 region:rollup2
APPOINTEES.

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:44.763 region:rollup2
BUT THE STORY. EXPERIENCED WITH

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.665 region:rollup2
FIXED TERMS SO THAT THEY HAVE

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:48.300 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY THAT ALSO

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:50.569 region:rollup2
CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THIS.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.404 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP TURNOVER MIGHT BE

00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:54.072 region:rollup2
VALUABLE BUT OF COURSE. TO DO

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:54.973 region:rollup2
THIS IN A PUBLIC WAY WITH THE

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:57.442 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WHETHER IT'S FOR A

00:27:54.973 --> 00:28:00.445 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SITE OR OTHER THINGS

00:27:57.442 --> 00:28:02.080 region:rollup2
CAN COME. GET ANSWERS HAVE A

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:04.249 region:rollup2
BOARD THAT CARES WITH SOME

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.918 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TRY TO TO GET

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:07.452 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND BREAK THROUGH A

00:28:05.918 --> 00:28:09.121 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF THE INSULARITY.

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:10.622 region:rollup2
THAT SOME STILL OBSERVE WITH

00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:11.957 region:rollup2
THIS DEPARTMENT. THESE ARE SOME

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:14.459 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS THAT. YOU'RE

00:28:11.957 --> 00:28:15.494 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT A NEW STRUCTURE I

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:16.628 region:rollup2
THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THAT

00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:18.897 region:rollup2
AGAIN THAT'S JUST REALLY

00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:20.832 region:rollup2
SPEAKING FOR ME. THERE WAS NOT A

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:23.368 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS AMONG THE PANEL ON HOW

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:24.336 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS WE LEFT IT TO YOUR

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:26.939 region:rollup2
BRIGHTER MINDS.

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:28.273 region:rollup2
BUT. I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO. TWO

00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:32.077 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TEN WHEN I GOT ELECTED

00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:34.179 region:rollup2
AND I HAD A GERMAN CORKS JOB ET.

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:36.248 region:rollup2
VIRAL SAFETY IN TOXIC MATERIAL

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:39.484 region:rollup2
SO I'VE HAD PLENTY OF. HEARINGS

00:28:36.248 --> 00:28:41.019 region:rollup2
ON HIGH. DTS SEE. AND THERE'S

00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:42.321 region:rollup2
ALWAYS EEN THIS CHALLENGE I

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:43.789 region:rollup2
GUESS OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS

00:28:42.321 --> 00:28:45.224 region:rollup2
THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG DO WE

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:47.593 region:rollup2
GIVE THE DEPARTMENT MORE MONEY

00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:50.095 region:rollup2
WITH MORE POSITIONS TO FIX IT OR

00:28:47.593 --> 00:28:50.662 region:rollup2
THEY GET A FUNDAMENTALLY FIX.

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:52.731 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT THEY OPERATE I

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:53.899 region:rollup2
THINK SOME OF THE TRANSPARENCY

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:57.336 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES.

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:58.704 region:rollup2
ATTACHED AT THE QUESTION IS IS

00:28:57.336 --> 00:29:00.339 region:rollup2
ON THE.

00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:02.374 region:rollup2
THE SACRED MEDIATION ACCOUNT AND

00:29:00.339 --> 00:29:03.675 region:rollup2
THAT TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL

00:29:02.374 --> 00:29:05.544 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THIS SEEMS YOU'VE

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:08.146 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED THOSE ACCOUNTS IS

00:29:05.544 --> 00:29:10.248 region:rollup2
BEING SHORT OF MONEY. IT AND

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:11.817 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALWAYS YOU YOUR TESTIMONY

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:13.452 region:rollup2
AND THE REPORT INDICATES THAT

00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:15.020 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FEELS

00:29:13.452 --> 00:29:16.888 region:rollup2
LIKE. THEY.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.857 region:rollup2
TEN TIMES AS MUCH FOR THAT THE

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:21.393 region:rollup2
SERVICES IS ENOUGH IS THAT A

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:21.960 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND.

00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:23.695 region:rollup2
PRIORITY THAT THAT THAT THAT

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.230 region:rollup2
THE.

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:27.633 region:rollup2
THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.800 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TWO TO

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:30.969 region:rollup2
AUGMENT NOW IT'S SO THAT WE

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.672 region:rollup2
DON'T.

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:35.240 region:rollup2
WE DON'T START CHASING ALL THE.

00:29:33.672 --> 00:29:36.208 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OR

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.743 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT ARE

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:39.578 region:rollup2
OCCURRING ARE ORPHANED SITES IN

00:29:37.743 --> 00:29:41.280 region:rollup2
THE SUPERFUND SITES.

00:29:39.578 --> 00:29:43.482 region:rollup2
YEAH I.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.982 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT

00:29:43.482 --> 00:29:47.419 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:49.454 region:rollup2
OF. THE ACCOUNTS DO HAVE

00:29:47.419 --> 00:29:51.623 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL DEFICITS.

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:53.825 region:rollup2
.

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:56.328 region:rollup2
WHY EXACTLY THAT IS?

00:29:53.825 --> 00:30:00.432 region:rollup2
WHERE ARE?

00:29:56.328 --> 00:30:03.635 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FEES. MIGHT BE.

00:30:00.432 --> 00:30:03.635 region:rollup2
HOW WE ARE PLANNING FOR THE

00:30:03.702 --> 00:30:07.439 region:rollup2
FUND SITES GET TURNED OVER TO

00:30:05.237 --> 00:30:09.041 region:rollup2
THE STATE WHICH THEN INCREASES

00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:11.476 region:rollup2
THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE?

00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:12.911 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR THE STATE I THINK IT

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:14.713 region:rollup2
BE WORTH WHILE AND.

00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:16.314 region:rollup2
JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU HAVING

00:30:14.713 --> 00:30:17.883 region:rollup2
CRUNCH THE NUMBERS TO REALLY

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:19.751 region:rollup2
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. WITH

00:30:17.883 --> 00:30:21.119 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY BUT IT BE WORTH WHILE

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:22.954 region:rollup2
I THINK FOR YOUR BUDGET

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:24.556 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEES AND OTHERS TO

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:26.825 region:rollup2
REALLY LOOK AT THIS.

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:28.160 region:rollup2
AND DETERMINE. YOU KNOW WHAT

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.694 region:rollup2
ENDED DEPARTMENTS WRITTEN SOME

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.596 region:rollup2
REPORTS ON THIS ON THIS SR

00:30:28.694 --> 00:30:32.130 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:34.299 region:rollup2
SHORTFALL.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:36.234 region:rollup2
REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:39.604 region:rollup2
FUTURE LOOKS LIKE AND.

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:42.274 region:rollup2
AND. WHERE THE DEPARTMENT IS IN

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:44.042 region:rollup2
TERMS OF ITS FUNDING BUT AGAIN?

00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:45.277 region:rollup2
I THINK A PART OF THAT HAS TO

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:47.279 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:30:45.277 --> 00:30:48.513 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:50.549 region:rollup2
YOU FEEL THAT THE DOLLARS ARE

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:51.483 region:rollup2
BEING SPENT WISELY. AND THAT THE

00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:54.252 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS MEETING ITS

00:30:51.483 --> 00:30:58.156 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:59.024 region:rollup2
I'LL MENTION. IS. EITHER HAD

00:30:58.156 --> 00:30:59.458 region:rollup2
BEEN A LOT OF.

00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:02.494 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

00:30:59.458 --> 00:31:04.162 region:rollup2
OF CHANGE CHANGES.

00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:04.930 region:rollup2
AND FINANCE LETTERS ETCETERA

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:06.198 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.966 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT DIFFERENT THINGS OVER

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:09.134 region:rollup2
THE PAST. THREE TO FIVE YEARS

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:10.836 region:rollup2
AND WE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT AND

00:31:09.134 --> 00:31:13.271 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY DO IS. WHEN THEY.

00:31:10.836 --> 00:31:14.406 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE REQUESTS OF YOU THEY

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:16.341 region:rollup2
PUT TOGETHER WHAT THEY'RE GOING

00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:17.943 region:rollup2
TO DO. WITH CERTAIN TIME LINES

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:19.711 region:rollup2
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND WE ASK

00:31:17.943 --> 00:31:21.113 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT HEY. LET'S LOOK

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:22.714 region:rollup2
AT THOSE LAST FIVE YEARS A

00:31:21.113 --> 00:31:25.584 region:rollup2
BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AND.

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:27.185 region:rollup2
TELL US HAVE YOU MET ALL THE

00:31:25.584 --> 00:31:28.987 region:rollup2
THINGS YOU WERE GOING TO DO. AND

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:31.289 region:rollup2
FRANKLY WE THAT REPORT WE DIDN'T

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:32.491 region:rollup2
GET UNTIL OUR LAST MEETING AND

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:34.392 region:rollup2
IT WAS REALLY TOO LATE TO

00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:35.660 region:rollup2
ANALYZE IT.

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:37.362 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S YOUR JOB TO LOOK AT

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.064 region:rollup2
THAT STUFF BUT AGAIN YOU HAVE SO

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:40.565 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER PRIORITIES.

00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:41.867 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK THERE IS SOME AND

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:44.202 region:rollup2
THE MINISTRATIONS CERTAINLY IS

00:31:41.867 --> 00:31:45.137 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT NO DOUBT. BE

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:48.006 region:rollup2
HELPFUL.

00:31:45.137 --> 00:31:49.775 region:rollup2
FOR WHICH IN A TRANSPARENT WAY

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:52.043 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

00:31:49.775 --> 00:31:54.146 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET. I MEAN THERE'S THERE

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:55.480 region:rollup2
ARE THE STATES OR FAN SITES THAT

00:31:54.146 --> 00:31:57.115 region:rollup2
THE ORPHAN FOR REASON WE DON'T

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.216 region:rollup2
HAVE A RESPONSIBLE PERSON AND

00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:59.217 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE GETTING THE FEDERALS

00:31:58.216 --> 00:32:00.685 region:rollup2
WERE FAN SITES THAT ARE COMING

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:03.188 region:rollup2
IN AND WE AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:06.291 region:rollup2
SHORT OF. OF JOE ON THE ON THE

00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:07.592 region:rollup2
POSITIONS ON PAGE TWENTY

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:09.628 region:rollup2
REFERENCE THE FIVE.

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:10.228 region:rollup2
POSITIONS THAT WERE REDIRECTED

00:32:09.628 --> 00:32:13.331 region:rollup2
FROM.

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:14.733 region:rollup2
THE.

00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:16.334 region:rollup2
WHERE WAS THAT CONFERENCE THERE

00:32:14.733 --> 00:32:17.469 region:rollup2
WERE FIVE SITES THAT WERE READ

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:18.870 region:rollup2
TO RID OUR FIVE POSITIONS THAT

00:32:17.469 --> 00:32:22.140 region:rollup2
WERE REDIRECTED FOR?

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:24.075 region:rollup2
AS I GUESS THE REMEDIATION WORK

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.610 region:rollup2
AND YOUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:27.279 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT MAKING

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.947 region:rollup2
THOSE PERMANENT RATHER THAN RE

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:31.183 region:rollup2
DIRECT THEM. AND I MADE A NOTE

00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:33.985 region:rollup2
IN.

00:32:31.183 --> 00:32:34.586 region:rollup2
I SHOULD ADMIT A DASH HERE.

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.987 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU WENT THROUGH THIS

00:32:34.586 --> 00:32:37.088 region:rollup2
SITE MITIGATION REPORT AND

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:38.290 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE SECTION WHERE

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:41.092 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT WE CREATED THESE

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.426 region:rollup2
LIMITED TERMS SEVERAL YEARS OF

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:43.762 region:rollup2
LIMITED TERM.

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:46.164 region:rollup2
.

00:32:43.762 --> 00:32:47.866 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:50.335 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE WERE FIVE

00:32:47.866 --> 00:32:52.103 region:rollup2
REDIRECTED POSITIONS.

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:55.173 region:rollup2
IN MY READING.

00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:56.041 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT.

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:56.408 region:rollup2
IF THAT WAS RECOMMENDATION I

00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:58.677 region:rollup2
THINK WAS MADE.

00:32:56.408 --> 00:32:59.010 region:rollup2
.

00:32:58.677 --> 00:33:00.612 region:rollup2
YEAH EARLY ON.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.380 region:rollup2
.

00:33:00.612 --> 00:33:04.316 region:rollup2
.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.018 region:rollup2
THE IF YOU RECALL THERE WAS A

00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:08.320 region:rollup2
BIG ISSUE WITH HUNDREDS OF.

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:10.255 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.723 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OR SOMETHING OF COST

00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:13.859 region:rollup2
RECOVERY THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:17.062 region:rollup2
HADN'T PURSUED. AND THEY BROUGHT

00:33:13.859 --> 00:33:17.996 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE AND. TO SORT OF

00:33:17.062 --> 00:33:20.432 region:rollup2
THOUGHT IT THROUGH THAT.

00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:21.733 region:rollup2
.

00:33:20.432 --> 00:33:24.202 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S TWO OBSERVATIONS

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:26.271 region:rollup2
TO MAKE ON THAT ONE IS. THAT IN

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:27.672 region:rollup2
THE END MOST OF THOSE COSTS WERE

00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:30.075 region:rollup2
SIMPLY WRITTEN OFF. THAT MONEY

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:31.376 region:rollup2
WAS LOST.

00:33:30.075 --> 00:33:32.911 region:rollup2
THE OTHER OBSERVATION WHICH IS

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:33.945 region:rollup2
MORE POSITIVE IS THAT I THINK

00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:35.547 region:rollup2
THOSE POSITIONS IN THE

00:33:33.945 --> 00:33:37.549 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE HAVE MUCH

00:33:35.547 --> 00:33:39.751 region:rollup2
BETTER COST RECOVERY PROCEDURES

00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:41.753 region:rollup2
IN PLACE. I'M CONFIDENT THE

00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:43.088 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:44.489 region:rollup2
SEE THAT KIND OF PROBLEM AGAIN.

00:33:43.088 --> 00:33:46.458 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:47.492 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:33:46.458 --> 00:33:50.362 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING.

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:52.097 region:rollup2
AT ANOTHER THING THAT'S RELATED

00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:53.732 region:rollup2
TO THAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY.

00:33:52.097 --> 00:33:56.668 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT MADE THE TRANSITION

00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:58.470 region:rollup2
TO A CALIPHATES FISCALE BUT

00:33:56.668 --> 00:34:01.139 region:rollup2
STILL THEY'RE BILLING PRISSY. I

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:03.041 region:rollup2
T. TECHNOLOGY IS OUTDATED THAT

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:04.676 region:rollup2
MADE A REQUEST TO GET A NEW

00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:06.311 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN PLACE BUT THAT WAS

00:34:04.676 --> 00:34:09.581 region:rollup2
LIKE FIVE STEPS TO TAKE TO

00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:12.083 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO. THE I. T.

00:34:09.581 --> 00:34:14.085 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE IMPROVED OF. THESE

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:17.122 region:rollup2
POSITIONS I THINK PARTICULARLY

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:18.290 region:rollup2
THOSE FIVE WERE TO GET THE COST

00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:20.058 region:rollup2
RECOVERY HOUSE IN ORDER.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:23.495 region:rollup2
I THINK WE FEEL THAT THE COST

00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:24.095 region:rollup2
RECOVERY HOUSE IS IN ORDER NOW.

00:34:23.495 --> 00:34:25.630 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE WAS A REASON

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:27.098 region:rollup2
WHY. IN A YEAR AND A HALF TWO

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.667 region:rollup2
YEARS LATER THOSE POSITIONS CAN

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:33.972 region:rollup2
BE REPURPOSED.

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:35.473 region:rollup2
OKAY A GERMAN COURT QUESTIONS.

00:34:33.972 --> 00:34:37.108 region:rollup2
TOM PERSONAL LOAN ACCOUNT.

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:38.743 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT CHAIRMAN WHY CASKEY

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:40.745 region:rollup2
IN.

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:42.547 region:rollup2
BRINGING UP ALL THOSE QUESTIONS

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:43.448 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE VERY LITTLE LEFT TO

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:45.584 region:rollup2
SAY.

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:48.420 region:rollup2
.

00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:50.789 region:rollup2
YES EXCELLENT JOB SENATOR.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.591 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU AGAIN

00:34:50.789 --> 00:34:54.726 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND.

00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:56.561 region:rollup2
DID YOU FEEL DURING THE COURSE

00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:57.896 region:rollup2
OF TIME PARTICULARLY AFTER.

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:59.597 region:rollup2
.

00:34:57.896 --> 00:35:00.999 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR LEE CAME ON BOARD THAT

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:02.267 region:rollup2
YOU WERE GETTING GOOD

00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:05.570 region:rollup2
COOPERATION IN YOUR.

00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:10.675 region:rollup2
EXAMINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:12.444 region:rollup2
FROM DEPARTMENT MEMBERS.

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:15.246 region:rollup2
YES I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES.

00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:17.849 region:rollup2
OF. THE DEPARTMENT.

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:20.852 region:rollup2
BUT. DID ITS BEST TO PROVIDE US

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:25.390 region:rollup2
WITH. THE INFORMATION AND THEY

00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:27.158 region:rollup2
SIGNED A STAFFER TO HELP US.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:30.662 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS A LOT OF WORK FOR

00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:34.432 region:rollup2
THEM AND APPLAUD THE DIRECTOR.

00:35:30.662 --> 00:35:36.568 region:rollup2
UP FOR THAT.

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:38.803 region:rollup2
ONE THING TO MENTION IS SORT OF

00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:39.704 region:rollup2
OUR INDEPENDENT IN A ROLE.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:41.940 region:rollup2
AND.

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:43.174 region:rollup2
OF.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.576 region:rollup2
PERHAPS IN THE BEGINNING WHAT

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:46.044 region:rollup2
SOME THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:48.046 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A PARTNERSHIP

00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:48.246 region:rollup2
WITH THE DEPARTMENT.

00:35:48.046 --> 00:35:50.348 region:rollup2
WHERE?

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:52.884 region:rollup2
?

00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:54.886 region:rollup2
THE I RP WAS SORT OF PART OF

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:57.255 region:rollup2
THE TEAM.

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:58.857 region:rollup2
I I THINK. TOWARDS THE END SORT

00:35:57.255 --> 00:36:00.892 region:rollup2
OF THE INDEPENDENT ROLE OF THE

00:35:58.857 --> 00:36:02.660 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. YOU KNOW SORT OF

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:04.496 region:rollup2
YOUR PREVENTED THAT A LITTLE BIT

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.897 region:rollup2
IF YOU FOLLOW ME NOBODY LIKES

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:08.266 region:rollup2
INSPECTOR GENERAL OR AN

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:10.869 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT BODY RUNNING AROUND

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:13.171 region:rollup2
IN THE DEPARTMENT. I'D HOPE THAT

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:16.307 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT.

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:17.275 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OF A RELATIONSHIP IN

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:20.678 region:rollup2
THE END IT DIDN'T REALLY TURN

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:21.446 region:rollup2
OUT. TO BE THAT WAY IT WAS A

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:25.450 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN ARM'S

00:36:21.446 --> 00:36:29.254 region:rollup2
LENGTH TYPE OF. A RELATIONSHIP.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:31.156 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE END THE.

00:36:29.254 --> 00:36:33.525 region:rollup2
THE RP WAS NOT ALLOWED. FOR WAS

00:36:31.156 --> 00:36:35.126 region:rollup2
STRONGLY. RECOMMENDED AGAINST

00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:37.028 region:rollup2
GOING AND VISITING THE DISTRICT

00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:38.630 region:rollup2
OFFICES TO SORT OF INTERVIEW THE

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:40.565 region:rollup2
STAFF.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:42.400 region:rollup2
CANDID WAY TO SORT OF GET TO

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:44.235 region:rollup2
KNOW THEM.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.204 region:rollup2
THE. DEPARTMENT THOUGHT IT WOULD

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:47.672 region:rollup2
BE DISRUPTIVE SO WE ENDED UP NOT

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:49.841 region:rollup2
DOING THAT.

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:50.709 region:rollup2
WE GOT OTHER INFORMATION IN

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:54.779 region:rollup2
OTHER WAYS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:56.581 region:rollup2
FOUND. MORE APPROPRIATE.

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:59.417 region:rollup2
SO THEY WORK VERY HARD. YOU CAN

00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:00.351 region:rollup2
SEE THAT. MOUNT OF INFORMATION

00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:03.088 region:rollup2
THEY GAVE US.

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:05.023 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IT THANK THEM FOR THAT.

00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:05.990 region:rollup2
BUT I'LL SAY IN FAIRNESS IT WAS

00:37:05.023 --> 00:37:08.460 region:rollup2
A BIT OF A ARM'S LENGTH

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:11.062 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.031 region:rollup2
SO I'M. THAT'S INTERESTING SO I

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:14.999 region:rollup2
WAS A MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT WITH

00:37:13.031 --> 00:37:16.701 region:rollup2
MCKINSEY AND COMPANY OVER COURSE

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:18.236 region:rollup2
OF THE YEAR.

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:20.738 region:rollup2
I THINK IT I THINK IT'S A SHAME

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:22.674 region:rollup2
YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO TALK TO

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:24.809 region:rollup2
FOLKS BECAUSE ARM. TALKING TO

00:37:22.674 --> 00:37:26.144 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CANDIDLY ABOUT THEIR JOBS

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:27.812 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN A LOT MORE

00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:28.780 region:rollup2
THAN YOU CAN FROM JUST READING

00:37:27.812 --> 00:37:31.749 region:rollup2
REPORTS.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:36.321 region:rollup2
SO CERTAINLY I WOULD RECOMMEND

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:38.690 region:rollup2
SO. SENATOR. CONNIE LEIVA. WHOSE

00:37:36.321 --> 00:37:40.859 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THIS IS DAN HAS

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:45.096 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND HAS A BILL WHICH WOULD

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:47.532 region:rollup2
SET UP. AN INDEPENDENT BOARD.

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:49.033 region:rollup2
ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS BILL.

00:37:47.532 --> 00:37:50.535 region:rollup2
IT.

00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:52.604 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER HERE

00:37:50.535 --> 00:37:54.939 region:rollup2
BUT I TEN POINT I'D APPRECIATE

00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:56.241 region:rollup2
ANY DOUBLE THAT BILL IS ON THE

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:57.809 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY FLOOR WHETHER WORKING

00:37:56.241 --> 00:37:59.410 region:rollup2
OUT DETAILS WITH THE

00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:00.879 region:rollup2

WAY THAT BOARD IS STRUCTURED.

ON THAT AND I I DO THINK IT IS

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:30.041 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:38:27.205 --> 00:38:32.510 region:rollup2
THAT. WE'RE DEAD IF THERE IS A

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:36.548 region:rollup2

HE'S A RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.020 region:rollup2
FRANKLY THE PEOPLE AT THE. AT

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:44.155 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT LEVEL KNOW MORE

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:46.424 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW TO

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:48.026 region:rollup2
FIX IT THAN ANYONE ELSE DOES AND

00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:49.727 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU IN MY EXPERIENCE.

00:38:48.026 --> 00:38:51.262 region:rollup2
AS A MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT DOING

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:53.498 region:rollup2
MUCH THE SAME KIND OF WORK YOU

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:55.133 region:rollup2
DID THAT THE BEST INFORMATION.

00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:56.801 region:rollup2
COME FROM THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY

00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:59.003 region:rollup2
WHO DO THE JOBS DIRECTLY SO I

00:38:56.801 --> 00:39:00.772 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE AN

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:02.774 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT COMPONENT AND WILL.

00:39:00.772 --> 00:39:04.475 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS IN

00:39:02.774 --> 00:39:05.610 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY.

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:08.479 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:10.882 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T FIGHT.

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:12.417 region:rollup2
AND THREATENED TO VETO THE BILL.

00:39:10.882 --> 00:39:15.186 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL WE PUT IT

00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:17.121 region:rollup2
IN THERE AND WE'LL DO I'LL DO

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:19.757 region:rollup2
ALL WE CAN TO GET IT IN THERE.

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:20.325 region:rollup2
GO AHEAD YEAH CERTAINLY AS

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.693 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS.

00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:22.727 region:rollup2
.

00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:24.262 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO PUT SOMETHING IN

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:27.165 region:rollup2
PLACE THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE

00:39:24.262 --> 00:39:29.467 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FUNCTION. BETTER.

00:39:27.165 --> 00:39:32.170 region:rollup2
MORE SMOOTHLY. WE DON'T WANT TO

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:33.538 region:rollup2
PUT. NEW STRUCTURES IN PLACE

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.073 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA SLOW THINGS DOWN

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:38.243 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND AND.

00:39:35.073 --> 00:39:40.378 region:rollup2
GUM UP THE WORKS SO AGAIN IT IS

00:39:38.243 --> 00:39:41.646 region:rollup2
IT'S THERE'S. THIS BALANCE OF

00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:45.216 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THE JOB GETS

00:39:41.646 --> 00:39:47.418 region:rollup2
DONE WELL AND ON TIME. AND.

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:48.586 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:51.389 region:rollup2
WHAT IF ANYTHING COMES AFTER THE

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:53.992 region:rollup2
RP CERTAINLY KEEP THAT IN MIND.

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:56.160 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD.

00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:58.429 region:rollup2
SO THERE CERTAINLY IS AN ISSUE

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.231 region:rollup2
OF RESOURCES. THERE ALSO IS

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:03.868 region:rollup2
PROBABLY AN ISSUE OF

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:05.603 region:rollup2
STREAMLINING OF.

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:06.304 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT GET IN THE WAY OF

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:08.573 region:rollup2
DOING THE JOB.

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:10.775 region:rollup2
.

00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:13.011 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE ALSO THINGS THAT WE

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:16.214 region:rollup2
HAVE TO LOOK AT. AS WE STUDY A

00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:18.283 region:rollup2
REPORT FURTHER AND AS WE LOOK AT

00:40:16.214 --> 00:40:20.151 region:rollup2
PERHAPS RE DRAFTING. THE

00:40:18.283 --> 00:40:23.021 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:24.989 region:rollup2
WE WOULD CERTAINLY COME BACK TO

00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:27.458 region:rollup2
YOU AND THE DEPARTMENT AND TALK

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:29.794 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO THAT WOULD

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:32.063 region:rollup2
MAKE THE DEPARTMENT'S WORK COME

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:36.701 region:rollup2
OFF MORE QUICKLY.

00:40:32.063 --> 00:40:38.536 region:rollup2
AND HOPEFULLY LESS EXPENSIVELY.

00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:40.138 region:rollup2
YES SEVEN I THOUGHT I WAS ALL

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:42.206 region:rollup2
DONE BUT TO IF YOU. WANT TO COME

DEPARTMENT. AND TRYING TO FIGURE

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.813 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:50.381 region:rollup2
IF THERE ARE STRUCTURAL CHANGES

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:54.052 region:rollup2
THAT CAN SPEED UP THE WORK SO

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:55.687 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:40:54.052 --> 00:40:56.888 region:rollup2

EXPERTISE IN.

00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:08.159 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO AS SORT OF THE

THE VARIOUS.

00:42:11.062 --> 00:42:13.698 region:rollup2

A FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS THIS

00:42:18.503 --> 00:42:22.540 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR UNIT HAS. HAD A LOT

00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:24.342 region:rollup2
OF LEADERSHIP AND STAFFING

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.843 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THROUGH THE YEARS WHEN

00:42:24.342 --> 00:42:27.311 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO DO IS GIVE THEM

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:29.781 region:rollup2
CERTAIN METRICS. YOU KNOW.

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:31.949 region:rollup2
CONDOMS HOW MANY CASES ARE YOU

00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:33.317 region:rollup2
FILING IT'LL.

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:34.619 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ALL IN THE REPORT YOU

00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:36.220 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW MANY HOW LONG DOES IT

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:38.089 region:rollup2
TAKE YOU TO DO. WHAT KIND OF

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.291 region:rollup2
PENALTIES ARE YOU OF PUTTING

00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:40.558 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WHAT YOUR STAFF

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:42.593 region:rollup2
TURNOVER?

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:43.194 region:rollup2
?

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.362 region:rollup2
WE TRIED OUR BEST TO SENATORS

00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:46.030 region:rollup2
IN.

00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:47.331 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.933 region:rollup2
TRY TO GIVE SOME OBJECTIVE

00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:50.735 region:rollup2
CRITERIA AND HOW TO MEASURE HOW

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:52.236 region:rollup2
THESE FOLKS ARE DOING OTHER

00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:55.740 region:rollup2
THING AND JUST TO BE CANDID WITH

00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:57.475 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT IS. THIS PAY.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.977 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE JOBS THAT IN THIS

00:42:57.475 --> 00:43:01.579 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR UNIT DON'T PAY AS

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:03.881 region:rollup2
MUCH AS SOME OF THE COUNTIES. OR

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:05.550 region:rollup2
CITIES DO. SO IT'S HARD FOR THEM

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:06.818 region:rollup2
AND JOSH KNOWS THAT MISTER

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.619 region:rollup2
TOOGOOD KNOWS THIS FROM HIS TIME

00:43:06.818 --> 00:43:09.921 region:rollup2
THERE IT'S HARD TO ATTRACT GOOD

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:11.255 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND KEEP THEM. BECAUSE

00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:13.324 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GETTING PUBLISHED A LOT

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:15.927 region:rollup2
OF OTHER AGENCIES. THERE'S ALSO

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:17.061 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE THAT IS A LABOR ISSUE

00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:18.796 region:rollup2
AMONG THE DIFFERENT BARGAINING

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:20.865 region:rollup2
UNITS OF THE DEPARTMENT. BETWEEN

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:22.567 region:rollup2
THE STAFF SCIENTISTS. AND SOME

00:43:20.865 --> 00:43:24.168 region:rollup2
OF THE OTHER STAFFERS THAT

00:43:22.567 --> 00:43:25.470 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN INN IN THE INEQUALITY

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:27.505 region:rollup2
THERE. WHICH AGAIN HAS TO DO

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.172 region:rollup2
WITH BARGAINING UNITS IN OTHER

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:29.907 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:31.843 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE JUST JUST THE MORALE

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:33.544 region:rollup2
ISSUES BUT. TO ME IT SEEMS THAT

00:43:31.843 --> 00:43:35.847 region:rollup2
IF.

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:37.715 region:rollup2
IF IF FOLKS. WANT TO COME TO YOU

00:43:35.847 --> 00:43:39.484 region:rollup2
FOR MORE RESOURCES IT YOU GIVE

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:41.719 region:rollup2
THEM CRITERIA THAT YOU FEEL

00:43:39.484 --> 00:43:43.187 region:rollup2
SATISFIED WITH. THAT ENABLE TO

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:45.890 region:rollup2
YOU TOO.

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:46.691 region:rollup2
ASSESS HOW THEY'RE DOING.

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.426 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S THE

00:43:46.691 --> 00:43:50.795 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE NEEDS MORE

00:43:48.426 --> 00:43:53.197 region:rollup2
OF THAT. THAT WAS A MAJOR FOCUS

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.798 region:rollup2
OF OUR WORK PUTTING.

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:56.200 region:rollup2
TIVOLI.

00:43:53.798 --> 00:43:57.535 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE PERFORMANCE METRICS

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.303 region:rollup2
IN PLACE THAT WE THOUGHT MEANT

00:43:57.535 --> 00:44:01.305 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:02.640 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO MONITOR THAT THE

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:05.142 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE NOT LONGER

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.743 region:rollup2
THERE TO MONITOR. AND AGAIN AS

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:07.712 region:rollup2
YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I KNOW YOUR

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:09.247 region:rollup2
SCIENTIST. SENATOR QUIRK YOU

00:44:07.712 --> 00:44:11.149 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:44:09.247 --> 00:44:12.250 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE.

00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:14.318 region:rollup2
THE QUALITY YOUR CONCLUSIONS

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.786 region:rollup2
ALSO DEPENDS ON. THE QUALITY OF

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:17.822 region:rollup2
THE DATA THAT YOU'RE GETTING.

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:19.590 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S VERY HARD TO MONITOR

00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:20.791 region:rollup2
AS WELL SO THERE'S NO SILVER

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:24.662 region:rollup2
BULLETS FOR ALL OF THIS BUT WE

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:30.902 region:rollup2
DO OUR BEST.

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:33.604 region:rollup2
HE'D LIKE.

00:44:30.902 --> 00:44:34.906 region:rollup2
THERE. YEAH.

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:36.274 region:rollup2
SO IMPRESSED BECAUSE I REMEMBER

00:44:34.906 --> 00:44:37.775 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED A COUPLE

00:44:36.274 --> 00:44:39.210 region:rollup2
OF YEARS AGO AND AND JUST THE

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:40.778 region:rollup2
THE THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:43.281 region:rollup2
YOUR KNOWLEDGE NOW AND AN

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:44.916 region:rollup2
EXPLOITATION. OF IT'S JUST

00:44:43.281 --> 00:44:46.017 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARY AND SO HELPFUL. IN

00:44:44.916 --> 00:44:48.152 region:rollup2
IS THE FORMER CHAIR OF THIS

00:44:46.017 --> 00:44:50.454 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WHEN ALL OF THIS I

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:52.690 region:rollup2
THINK STARTED WE. REALLY SAW A

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:53.925 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT DTS

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.092 region:rollup2
SHE HAD.

00:44:53.925 --> 00:44:58.329 region:rollup2
AND IN ONE OF THE THE FIRST

00:44:55.092 --> 00:45:00.031 region:rollup2
COMMENT THAT YOU MADE WAS THE. A

00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:02.400 region:rollup2
AND THE RECORD KIND OF OLD.

00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:04.168 region:rollup2
FIRST OBSERVATION WAS THE THE

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.636 region:rollup2
TURNOVER AND THE CHALLENGES THAT

00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:06.604 region:rollup2
THAT BROUGHT OVER THE LAST FEW

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:10.141 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:45:06.604 --> 00:45:12.443 region:rollup2
DID YOU DETERMINE FROM YOUR

00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:14.779 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF WHAT YOU SAW ANY

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:16.147 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR. REASON FOR THAT I

00:45:14.779 --> 00:45:18.983 region:rollup2
GUESS THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT

00:45:16.147 --> 00:45:20.184 region:rollup2
THAT MAY WE MAY SEE IF IF THOSE.

00:45:18.983 --> 00:45:21.919 region:rollup2
ISSUES HAVEN'T BEEN DEALT WITH

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:24.922 region:rollup2
THEIR HAND OR WE MAY SEE THAT

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:25.456 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD.

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:28.859 region:rollup2
YEAH IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:29.627 region:rollup2
.

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:31.462 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

00:45:29.627 --> 00:45:33.898 region:rollup2
ASK. THEM TO GET TWO

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:35.233 region:rollup2
OBSERVATIONS WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT

00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:38.069 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHY DID THIS PERSON

00:45:35.233 --> 00:45:39.103 region:rollup2
LEAVE FOR THAT PERSON LEAVE.

00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:40.504 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IT SEEMS LIKE

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:42.673 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ALWAYS HAS THEIR OWN

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:45.276 region:rollup2
REASONS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY TOOK A

00:45:42.673 --> 00:45:46.244 region:rollup2
BETTER JOB SOMEBODY HAD. HEALTH

00:45:45.276 --> 00:45:48.913 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN THE FAMILY.

00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:50.281 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS SEEM TO

00:45:48.913 --> 00:45:52.550 region:rollup2
BE.

00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:54.752 region:rollup2
BUT A ONE OFF BASIS VERY

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.419 region:rollup2
JUSTIFIABLE REASONS. BUT THEN

00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:57.588 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT LOOK AT ALL OF

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:58.723 region:rollup2
IT. YOU YOU SEE WHEN WE FIRST

00:45:57.588 --> 00:46:01.459 region:rollup2
STARTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR

00:45:58.723 --> 00:46:02.927 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE. I THINK OF THE TOP.

00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:04.962 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN OR THIRTY LEADERSHIP

00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:05.563 region:rollup2
POSITIONS LIKE THREE OF THEM HAD

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:08.299 region:rollup2
BEEN THERE FOR MORE THAN TWO

00:46:05.563 --> 00:46:09.300 region:rollup2
YEARS.SO I THINK YOU YOU TURN

00:46:08.299 --> 00:46:11.502 region:rollup2
AROUND AND SAY WELL INTO

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.904 region:rollup2
SOMETHING. MORE IMPORTANT DEEPER

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:14.505 region:rollup2
GOING ON HERE. I THINK THAT'S

00:46:13.904 --> 00:46:16.173 region:rollup2
THE SORT OF SECOND POINT WHICH

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:17.908 region:rollup2
IS THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:18.609 region:rollup2
TO WORK IN A DEPARTMENT.

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:21.879 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:23.047 region:rollup2
.

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:24.348 region:rollup2
IS SUBJECT TO A LOT OF THE

00:46:23.047 --> 00:46:26.784 region:rollup2
CRITICISM.

00:46:24.348 --> 00:46:29.053 region:rollup2
WHERE MAYBE THERE IS HIGHER PAY

00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:29.353 region:rollup2
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR?

00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:30.921 region:rollup2
SO I THINK.

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:32.423 region:rollup2
.

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:34.025 region:rollup2
OF ALL OF OUR JOBS AND THAT'S

00:46:32.423 --> 00:46:36.794 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FOCUS SO MUCH ON THE

00:46:34.025 --> 00:46:38.996 region:rollup2
HUMAN RESOURCES ASPECT. IS TO

00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:41.198 region:rollup2
MAKE THE DEPARTMENT DATE OF A

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:43.200 region:rollup2
MORE INVITING PLACE TO WORK TO

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:45.336 region:rollup2
TRY TO FIND MECHANISMS TO

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.604 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT FROM

00:46:45.336 --> 00:46:50.207 region:rollup2
WITHIN.

00:46:46.604 --> 00:46:50.775 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO PRAISE THE DEPARTMENT

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:53.110 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S IT'S DOING A GOOD

00:46:50.775 --> 00:46:55.346 region:rollup2
JOB.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:58.215 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S IT'S A BALANCE

00:46:55.346 --> 00:46:58.849 region:rollup2
OF THOSE THINGS WE'RE HAPPY TO

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:00.418 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT TWO AND A HALF YEARS

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:02.253 region:rollup2
LATER. THERE APPEARS AT LEAST AT

00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:04.121 region:rollup2
THAT LEADERSHIP LEVEL TO BE MORE

00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:05.456 region:rollup2
CONTINUITY.

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:06.757 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR LEE IS A VERY DIFFICULT

00:47:05.456 --> 00:47:08.926 region:rollup2

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:09.199 region:rollup2
LACKING IN OVERSIGHT ANY LEGAL

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:12.436 region:rollup2

THE LEAD CONTAMINATION IN PLACE

00:51:51.742 --> 00:51:54.511 region:rollup2
ANYWAY ACTUALLY BROUGHT

00:51:52.977 --> 00:51:56.981 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT COULD TESTIFY

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:58.449 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEIR AILMENTS AS A RESULT

00:51:56.981 --> 00:52:00.718 region:rollup2
OF THE EXPOSURE OVER THE YEARS

HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:21.405 region:rollup2
STILL REMAINS IN THAT ACCOUNT

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:23.107 region:rollup2
WE'VE ONLY SEEN I BELIEVE ABOUT

00:52:21.405 --> 00:52:25.075 region:rollup2

CLEANED OR SOME REMEDIATION HAS

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:31.915 region:rollup2
HAPPENED.

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:33.517 region:rollup2
BUT THEY FAIL TO MEET THEIR

THEIR OWN DEADLINES AND THEIR

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:36.687 region:rollup2
OWN.

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:38.489 region:rollup2
PLANNING SO MANY MANY THINGS

00:52:36.687 --> 00:52:40.691 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HEARD EARLIER I WOULD I

00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:43.127 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY YES WE ABSOLUTELY NEED

TO STICK TO THEIR PLANS. THEY

00:52:43.127 --> 00:52:45.796 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:52:44.662 --> 00:52:47.631 region:rollup2
THAT THEY MEET THEIR BUDGET

00:52:45.796 --> 00:52:49.566 region:rollup2
GOALS AS WELL AND IF THEY NEED

00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:51.201 region:rollup2
TO HAVE MORE COOPERATION WITH

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:52.803 region:rollup2

WAS VERY COMMITTED TO GETTING

00:52:58.776 --> 00:53:01.845 region:rollup2
RESPONSE FROM OUR COMMUNITY AND

00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:04.281 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:05.849 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY WAS WHAT I LIKE TO

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:08.218 region:rollup2
SAY PUT BOOTS OUT ON THE GROUND.

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:09.987 region:rollup2

WALKED WITH STAFF AND

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:46.790 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERS.

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:48.992 region:rollup2
OF. MAYBE SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS WHERE

THE LINE AND IT WAS VERY

00:53:55.499 --> 00:53:59.036 region:rollup2
SHOCKING. FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO

THERE AND AND.

00:54:02.106 --> 00:54:06.210 region:rollup2
FELT THAT THERE WAS REALLY A

00:54:04.775 --> 00:54:08.479 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF THE

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.813 region:rollup2
STATE AND AS WELL AS THE COUNTY

00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:11.648 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY BLAME ANYBODY IN

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:13.450 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:14.918 region:rollup2
GET OUT THERE AND RECTIFY THIS

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:16.653 region:rollup2
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME.

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:18.722 region:rollup2
WE HAD ANOTHER CURRENTS ANOTHER

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:20.591 region:rollup2
PART OF THE COUNTY OF THE SO

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:23.227 region:rollup2
CANYON WHERE YOU SAW AN

00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:23.727 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND FORCE

00:54:23.227 --> 00:54:26.530 region:rollup2
AND.

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:28.365 region:rollup2
LAWYERS AND ALL EVERYONE WAS

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.433 region:rollup2
PAYING FULL ATTENTION TO THAT

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:31.935 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE STATE AND THE

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:32.970 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR WE DIDN'T SEE THAT WITH

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:33.637 region:rollup2
EXCITING WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:35.139 region:rollup2
IT.

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:37.541 region:rollup2
WE STILL FEEL THAT.

00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:39.743 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED IN TERMS

00:54:37.541 --> 00:54:42.946 region:rollup2
OF THE KIND OF OUTREACH AND

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:43.413 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE BY DTS SEE A WE DID

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:50.020 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE A BETTER THE

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:52.356 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY SHORT. OF

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.524 region:rollup2
PATTERN AND TIME AND ALSO COME

00:54:52.356 --> 00:54:55.392 region:rollup2

PEOPLE AT WHAT LEVEL THEIR

00:54:55.392 --> 00:54:59.496 region:rollup2
HOUSES WERE IMPACTED BY BY THE

00:54:57.594 --> 00:55:01.165 region:rollup2
LEAD AND ALSO THEN WE'RE ABLE TO

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:02.933 region:rollup2
DO THAT. THROUGH OUR THROUGH OUR

00:55:01.165 --> 00:55:04.768 region:rollup2
OWN FUNDING WE DID THAT THROUGH

00:55:02.933 --> 00:55:06.003 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF. PUBLIC HEALTH

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:07.738 region:rollup2
AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT

00:55:06.003 --> 00:55:08.572 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU

00:55:07.738 --> 00:55:10.240 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

00:55:08.572 --> 00:55:11.809 region:rollup2
SINCE THE BEGINNING AND I

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.076 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND AND I HAVE SAT DOWN

00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:15.679 region:rollup2
AND I ACTUALLY MET.

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:17.247 region:rollup2
BARBARA LEE AND HER STAFF THEY

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:19.183 region:rollup2
DECIDED TO SET UP A COMMITTEE

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:20.284 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT AT THIS

00:55:19.183 --> 00:55:21.318 region:rollup2
POINT IF YOU WERE TO ASK THOSE

00:55:20.284 --> 00:55:23.020 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF THERE'S

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:24.888 region:rollup2
BEEN ANY STRONG RESULTS ARE

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.491 region:rollup2
ACTION. THINK MANY OF THEM WOULD

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:28.792 region:rollup2
SAY NO. DID NOTE THAT THEY

00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:30.627 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEEN NEGLIGENT IN IN

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:32.729 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LISTENING TO THEM AND

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:34.364 region:rollup2
GIVING THEM FEEDBACK AS TO WHAT

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:36.266 region:rollup2
THE PROGRESS IS AND WHAT THEIR

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:38.702 region:rollup2
ACTUAL PLAN IS IN AND IF IN FACT

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:40.470 region:rollup2
THEY STUCK TO THEIR PLAN. SINCE

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:42.372 region:rollup2
THEY STARTED THE CLEANUP WE HAD

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.507 region:rollup2
TO GO BACK IN BECAUSE OF THE

00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:46.410 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WANTED THE E. I. ARE

00:55:43.507 --> 00:55:48.245 region:rollup2
DONE THAT ALSO PUSH THIS BACK SO

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.646 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOW OUT SEVERAL MONTHS IN

00:55:48.245 --> 00:55:51.114 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE CLEAN UP. SINCE

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:52.749 region:rollup2
THAT TIME I'VE BEEN TOLD THERE

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:54.818 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN NO FURTHER CLEANUP AND

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:56.687 region:rollup2
FURTHER MORE WHAT I BELIEVE IS A

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:57.588 region:rollup2
IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. IS

00:55:56.687 --> 00:56:00.490 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:57.588 --> 00:56:01.525 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY DID. ROLL OUT A PLAN

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:03.994 region:rollup2
TO SAY THEY WOULD BEGIN A CLEAN

00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:06.763 region:rollup2
UP FADED TALK ABOUT CLEANING

00:56:03.994 --> 00:56:09.266 region:rollup2
INSIDE THE INTERIOR OF THE HOMES

00:56:06.763 --> 00:56:11.134 region:rollup2
OR THE PARKWAY IN FRONT OF THE

00:56:09.266 --> 00:56:13.270 region:rollup2
HOMES WE HAVE. A MATERIALS THAT

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:15.172 region:rollup2
WE SHARED WITH YOU SO HOW IS HOW

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:17.374 region:rollup2
IS IT FOR A RESULT PERSON TO

00:56:15.172 --> 00:56:19.610 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE CLEANING

00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:21.511 region:rollup2
SOMEONE'S SOIL IN THEIR FRONT

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:23.747 region:rollup2
YARD. BUT YOU'RE NOT CLEANING

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:26.316 region:rollup2
THE PARKWAY WHERE YOU GET OFF

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:27.584 region:rollup2
THE CARTER CAR OFF THE SIDEWALK

00:56:26.316 --> 00:56:30.220 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE WALKING IN YOUR HOME

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:32.456 region:rollup2
AND YOUR CHILD OR ANYONE THAT

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:34.758 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. BRING THAT

00:56:32.456 --> 00:56:36.493 region:rollup2
SAME ELEMENT OR CONTAMINANTS IN

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:38.795 region:rollup2
YOUR HOME.

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:41.999 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT CLEANING IN MY

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:45.535 region:rollup2
OPINION THE WAY THAT YOU

00:56:41.999 --> 00:56:46.003 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY SHOULD. PROCEED IN

00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:50.607 region:rollup2
FACT.

00:56:46.003 --> 00:56:52.476 region:rollup2
IT WAS ALMOST LAUGHABLE THAT

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:55.345 region:rollup2
DAY US SAID THAT.

00:56:52.476 --> 00:56:57.581 region:rollup2
WERE KNOCKING INSISTED PEOPLE

00:56:55.345 --> 00:57:00.250 region:rollup2
CLEAR CLEAN THEIR INTERIOR BUT

00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:00.851 region:rollup2
WE'LL GIVE YOU A COUPON AND YOU

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.152 region:rollup2

00:57:00.851 --> 00:57:02.953 region:rollup2
ZACH COUPON AND GO AND UP

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:03.587 region:rollup2
CONTACT THESE PEOPLE AND THEY'LL

00:57:02.953 --> 00:57:04.121 region:rollup2
COME IN AND THEY'LL. VACUUM BUT

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:05.055 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T THE APPROPRIATE

00:57:04.121 --> 00:57:05.756 region:rollup2
STANDARD OF CLEAN UP THAT I KNOW

00:57:05.055 --> 00:57:06.923 region:rollup2
OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:07.524 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE AND AND I I KNOW

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.191 region:rollup2
DOCTOR BELONG OR WE'LL TALK

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:08.825 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT. BUT THERE ARE MANY

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:09.493 region:rollup2
INSTANCES WHERE THERE'S BEEN A

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:10.127 region:rollup2
FAILURE NO ONE EVEN EXPLAIN TO

00:57:09.493 --> 00:57:12.229 region:rollup2
THE RESIDENTS WITH THAT COUPON

00:57:10.127 --> 00:57:13.397 region:rollup2
WAS. IT YOU COULDN'T

00:57:12.229 --> 00:57:14.665 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATE WHAT IT WAS YOU

00:57:13.397 --> 00:57:16.199 region:rollup2
WOULD THINK IT WAS JUST AN

00:57:14.665 --> 00:57:17.601 region:rollup2
ADVERTISEMENT IN FACT MANY

00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:19.569 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TOLD ME THEY THREW IT

00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:20.904 region:rollup2
AWAY ONE OFMY STAFFERS. WHO

00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:21.939 region:rollup2
LIVES IN THE AREA ACTUALLY

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:23.040 region:rollup2
BROUGHT THE COUPON IN AND I

00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:24.875 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WELL THERE'S NOTHING

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.543 region:rollup2
HERE TO DISTINGUISH THAT THIS IS

00:57:24.875 --> 00:57:28.645 region:rollup2
SOMETHING COMING FROM THE STATE

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:29.880 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING THAT IS OF URGENCY?

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:32.282 region:rollup2
SO THAT TO ME.

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:34.918 region:rollup2
CAUSES ME GREAT CONCERN THAT

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:36.920 region:rollup2
JUST THE LACK OF RESPECT FOR OUR

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:38.755 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY FOR EVEN THE STAKE

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.790 region:rollup2
HOLDERS AND THE DIFFERENT.

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:41.358 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS.

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:43.560 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET

00:57:41.358 --> 00:57:45.262 region:rollup2
SOMETHING DONE IN A IN THIS IN

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:47.097 region:rollup2
THIS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I AM

00:57:45.262 --> 00:57:49.433 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ALSO THAT THE CURRENT

00:57:47.097 --> 00:57:51.034 region:rollup2
BUDGET DOES NOT. ALLOW FOR IT

00:57:49.433 --> 00:57:52.102 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE SOME MOVEMENT

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:54.938 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY BY THE.

00:57:52.102 --> 00:57:56.740 region:rollup2
BUDGET OF SUBCOMMITTEES TO PUT

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:58.342 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND I GET TO SO WE CAN

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:59.476 region:rollup2
HAPPEN SO WE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO

00:57:58.342 --> 00:58:01.678 region:rollup2
THE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION

00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:03.347 region:rollup2
SO DETAILS HE COULD CONTINUE. I

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:05.949 region:rollup2
BEGIN THEIR CLEANUP.

00:58:03.347 --> 00:58:06.149 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A PLAN OF A I THINK

00:58:05.949 --> 00:58:08.652 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:10.620 region:rollup2
WE HAVE MANY MANY QUESTIONS.

00:58:08.652 --> 00:58:12.322 region:rollup2
REGARDING AND WOULD HOPE THAT.

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.257 region:rollup2
YOU WILL YOU WILL HEAR OUR

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:15.826 region:rollup2
PLEASE AND AND WORK WITH US WE

00:58:14.257 --> 00:58:17.894 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY WANT TO SEE MORE

00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:19.696 region:rollup2
FUNDING BECAUSE WE THINK WE CAN

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:21.331 region:rollup2
DO IT MORE EFFICIENTLY WITH

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:23.266 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY WORKING WITH THE

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:25.302 region:rollup2
TSC. BUT OBVIOUSLY HEARING

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:26.603 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE IF WE'VE

00:58:25.302 --> 00:58:27.904 region:rollup2
ALREADY PROVEN THAT WE CAN PUT

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:29.706 region:rollup2
BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND START TO

00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:31.675 region:rollup2
DO TESTING AND OTHER THINGS WHY

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:33.844 region:rollup2
IN THE WORLD. CAN'T THE STATE OR

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:35.178 region:rollup2
THIS DEPARTMENT GET THEIR ACT

00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:37.147 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. AND THIS ISN'T A

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:38.548 region:rollup2
CRITICISM ON ON THE GOVERNOR

00:58:37.147 --> 00:58:39.649 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW HE

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:41.985 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY PLACED SOME

00:58:39.649 --> 00:58:43.887 region:rollup2
FUNDING THERE BUT WE NEED MORE

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:45.956 region:rollup2

I ALSO BROUGHT WITH ME PUT A

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:53.397 region:rollup2

WE HEAR FROM YOUR EXPERT

WITNESSES ABOUT TWO MINUTES

00:58:59.436 --> 00:59:04.641 region:rollup2
EACH.

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:06.309 region:rollup2
OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANGELA

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:07.611 region:rollup2
GLOBAL DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR

HEALTH PROTECTION.

00:59:07.611 --> 00:59:11.848 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE SUPERVISORS COMMENTS

00:59:09.513 --> 00:59:13.750 region:rollup2
REFLECT WE ARE FOCUSED LIKE A

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:15.352 region:rollup2
LASER LIGHT ON.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:16.853 region:rollup2
THE X. SIDE COMMUNITY AND THE

00:59:15.352 --> 00:59:18.822 region:rollup2
CLEAN UP THAT'S GOING ON THERE.

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:21.425 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS

00:59:18.822 --> 00:59:23.627 region:rollup2
BOARD IN THE I. R. THE I. RP.

00:59:21.425 --> 00:59:25.762 region:rollup2
HAD A RESPONSIBILITY LOOK ACROSS

00:59:23.627 --> 00:59:27.230 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE DTS SEE

00:59:25.762 --> 00:59:29.066 region:rollup2
AND COME UP WITH WORK

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:30.233 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS. SUPERVISOR

00:59:29.066 --> 00:59:31.768 region:rollup2
ASKED ME TO PUT TOGETHER SOME

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:33.703 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON THE RECOMMENDATION I

00:59:31.768 --> 00:59:40.143 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE TO. MAYBE MAKE A WORD

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:41.144 region:rollup2
OR TWO ABOUT SIX OF THEM.

00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:42.946 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ONE IS THAT.

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:45.015 region:rollup2
.

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:47.350 region:rollup2
TO BUILD AFFECTED RELATIONSHIPS

00:59:45.015 --> 00:59:47.918 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMUNITY AND TO REGAIN

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:49.786 region:rollup2
TRUST BECAUSE ONCE YOU LOSE

00:59:47.918 --> 00:59:51.388 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:53.356 region:rollup2
WE'RE NO LONGER EFFECTIVE AT

00:59:51.388 --> 00:59:55.125 region:rollup2
DOING OUR JOBS AND I THINK. THAT

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:56.693 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THE DTS SEE ON

00:59:55.125 --> 00:59:57.894 region:rollup2
THEIR STAFF FEEL EVERY TIME THEY

00:59:56.693 --> 01:00:00.030 region:rollup2
GO INTO THE COMMUNITY IT'S

00:59:57.894 --> 01:00:02.566 region:rollup2
REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO CONDUCT

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:04.201 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK BECAUSE ONCE YOU LOSE

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:05.335 region:rollup2
THAT TRUST. IT'S JUST THE.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:06.970 region:rollup2
A BATTLE. SO I THINK.

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:08.438 region:rollup2
.

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.739 region:rollup2
PUTTING THE EFFORT THERE AS IT

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:11.741 region:rollup2
IS REFERENCED IN THE I. R. PEACH

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:13.543 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION THAT'S A VITAL WE

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:15.612 region:rollup2
LIKE ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:17.914 region:rollup2
THAT. WERE INCLUDED IN MR

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:20.150 region:rollup2
CRACKLES REPORT. BUT THIS IS ONE

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:21.885 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK SHOULD HIGHLIGHT

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:24.087 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HIGHLIGHT. ANOTHER

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:27.157 region:rollup2
ONE IS CLOSE COLLABORATIONS WITH

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:28.725 region:rollup2
LOCAL REGULATORY PARTNERS. AND

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:30.927 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PUBLIC

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:33.263 region:rollup2
HEALTH OFFICIALS WE THINK THAT.

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:34.865 region:rollup2
EXIDE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT IT BUT

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:36.566 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S EMBLEMATIC AND

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:38.401 region:rollup2
IT'S A REALLY GOOD SYMBOL FOR A

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:40.003 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT. WERE

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:41.238 region:rollup2
REFERENCED BEFORE WE EVEN CAME

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:42.772 region:rollup2
UP HERE. BECAUSE ALMOST

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:44.074 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:46.176 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S A SET SUSTAINABLE

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:47.944 region:rollup2
FUNDING. HOW DO WE MAINTAIN

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:49.813 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDING STREAMS HOW DO WE

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:50.981 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY FUND THE PROGRAMS

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:52.916 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THROUGHOUT THE

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:54.451 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT? THOSE WERE ALL

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:56.319 region:rollup2
PLAYED OUT IT EXCITE THE REASON

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:57.320 region:rollup2
WHY THIS BECAME A PUBLICLY

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:59.489 region:rollup2
FINANCED.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.124 region:rollup2
OBJECT IS BECAUSE THE FINANCIAL

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:02.893 region:rollup2
ASSURANCES THAT WERE REQUIRED IN

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:05.095 region:rollup2
THE LAW WERE NEVER UPDATED FOR

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:08.331 region:rollup2
EXCITE.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:10.066 region:rollup2
THE NEXT OF THE THIRD OF.

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:11.268 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION WAS THE CREATION

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:13.036 region:rollup2
OF AN OVERSIGHT BOARD AND I

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:15.539 region:rollup2
WON'T COMMENT ON THAT ANYMORE

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:18.642 region:rollup2
THAN GIDEON DID. OTHER THAN TO

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:19.709 region:rollup2
SAY THAT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:21.077 region:rollup2
ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:24.214 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT THAT

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:25.515 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF AN OVERSIGHT BODY.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.450 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:29.085 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL ASSURANCES SO THAT WE

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:31.621 region:rollup2
DON'T.

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:33.156 region:rollup2
REALLY UP PUT THESE BURDENS ON

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:34.724 region:rollup2
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:37.494 region:rollup2
FUND THINGS WHERE YOU HAVE AN

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:38.895 region:rollup2
ACTIVE. OPERATING FACILITY WHO'S

01:01:37.494 --> 01:01:40.096 region:rollup2
WHO'S BRINGING IN REVENUE.

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:41.665 region:rollup2
AWHILE THEY'RE ACTING BUT THEY

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:43.867 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL

01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:45.902 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN PLACE. AND THEN OF

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:47.804 region:rollup2
THE FAITH THE A FIFTH. THE FIVE

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:49.906 region:rollup2
YEAR REVIEWS FOR A LONG TERM

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:51.875 region:rollup2
SITE CLEANUPS ESSENTIAL

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:54.044 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION. WE REALLY SAW

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:55.378 region:rollup2
THAT PLAYING OUT IN EXCITED

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:57.581 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THIS CLEAN UP IS NOT

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:59.783 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED. WITH THE NECESSARY

01:01:57.581 --> 01:02:01.551 region:rollup2
CHANGES IT IN THE WAY IT IS

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:04.187 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED. WILL BE REVISITING

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.788 region:rollup2
THIS AGAIN AT SOME POINT AND

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:05.288 region:rollup2
WE'LL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THOSE

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:07.657 region:rollup2
SITES.

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:09.626 region:rollup2
MEN OF THE LAST ONE BEING THE

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:11.428 region:rollup2
CREATION OF THE STATE WIDE. TASK

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:13.897 region:rollup2
FORCE ON LEAD THERE IS NO

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:16.266 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL IN THE WORLD IT IS MORE

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:18.468 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVELY STUDY THAN LEAD. BUT

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:19.836 region:rollup2
WE STILL HAVE UP POISONINGS AND

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:21.771 region:rollup2
EXPOSURES THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:23.707 region:rollup2
HAVING. AND I THINK THIS IS ONE

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:26.076 region:rollup2
GOOD STEP WITHIN CALIFORNIA FOR

01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:27.310 region:rollup2
US TO TRY TO. TURN THAT AROUND

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.912 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.713 region:rollup2
AND I JUST SIMPLY WANT TO CLOSE

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:31.514 region:rollup2
BY SAYING THAT.

01:02:29.713 --> 01:02:33.016 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE COUNTY AND

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:33.650 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WITHIN OUR

WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THESE

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:46.196 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS GET IMPLEMENTED

SO.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:03:01.878 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WITH THE SENATORS HOW WE

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:05.348 region:rollup2
CAN DO THAT.

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:06.750 region:rollup2
YOUR FINAL WITNESS.

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:08.418 region:rollup2
I THINK FROM A TECHNICAL

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.953 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE RIGHT OUT OF THE

01:03:08.418 --> 01:03:11.454 region:rollup2
COUNTY IN DETAIL SEE I DON'T

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:13.723 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY SEE EYE TO EYE NOT

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:15.158 region:rollup2
ONLY ON SOME OF THE ASSESSMENTS

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:17.227 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO SOME OF THE STRATEGIES

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:18.328 region:rollup2
FOR CLEAN UP. AND I THINK UP

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:20.363 region:rollup2
FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:22.699 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE REALLY MORE DIALOGUE

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:24.434 region:rollup2
AND TRANSPARENCY. AS TO THOSE AS

01:03:22.699 --> 01:03:26.603 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT ASSESSMENT PROCESS

01:03:24.434 --> 01:03:28.338 region:rollup2
AND RATIONALE AS WELL AS SOME

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:29.673 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS ARE USING IN TERMS

01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:31.374 region:rollup2
OF DETERMINING HOW THINGS ARE

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:33.343 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE CLEANED UP. IS

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:34.611 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT STILL A DIALOGUE

01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:35.211 region:rollup2
THAT WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE

01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:37.247 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S SOME

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:39.215 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY'RE MAKING

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:41.451 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T ALLOW THE COMMUNITY

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:44.087 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY TO BE CONFIDENT. THAT

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:45.422 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE DONE THE HOMES WILL

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:46.690 region:rollup2
BE CLEAN AND SAFE TO RETURN TO.

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:48.091 region:rollup2
KNOW IT FROM A TECHNICAL

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.692 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE YOU NEED CAN NEVER

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:50.660 region:rollup2
HAVE A HUNDRED PERCENT

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:52.028 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE BUT WE DO FEEL LIKE

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.330 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BETTER METHODOLOGIES TO

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:56.099 region:rollup2
EMPLOY THAT WILL GIVE THE

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:56.633 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MUCH BETTER CONFIDENCE

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:57.734 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING

01:03:56.633 --> 01:04:00.704 region:rollup2

WANT TO.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:21.551 region:rollup2
A QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED IN

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:23.219 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING ARM ASKING PUBLIC

01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:23.787 region:rollup2
COMMENTERS VERY QUICKLY TO SAY

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:25.522 region:rollup2
WHAT HAS IMPROVED AND I WILL

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:27.457 region:rollup2
SAY.

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:29.058 region:rollup2
HAVING BEEN VERY INTIMATELY

01:05:27.457 --> 01:05:32.128 region:rollup2
INVOLVED WITH THIS AGENCY FOR.

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:34.764 region:rollup2
ABOUT A DECADE ON.

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:36.533 region:rollup2
THAT THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:38.568 region:rollup2
JUSTICE AND TRIBAL AFFAIRS.

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:40.503 region:rollup2
IT IS BEEN VERY OPPRESSIVE TO ME

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:42.672 region:rollup2
AND WITH GOOD DEDICATED STAFF

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:45.141 region:rollup2
AND STAFF LEVELS ON WE ALSO BEEN

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:47.310 region:rollup2
IMPRESSED WITH SOME OF. THE

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:49.379 region:rollup2
POSITIONS BEING FILLED AT THE

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:50.613 region:rollup2
HIGHER LEADERSHIP LEVELS AS WELL

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:52.215 region:rollup2
AS SOME.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:53.583 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:55.151 region:rollup2
LEAVING THAT PROBABLY NEEDED TO

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:57.120 region:rollup2
LIVE AWHILE AGO SO THOSE ARE TWO

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:58.521 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I WILL SAY WE HAVE

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.722 region:rollup2
BEEN IMPRESSED WITH.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:01.157 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:04.093 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HAVE.

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:07.964 region:rollup2
REALLY ESPECIALLY AFTER THE I

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:09.866 region:rollup2
RP HAS BEEN DISBANDED IS THIS

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:11.267 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF WHERE DO. IMPACTED

01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:13.036 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IMPACTED RESIDENTS

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:14.404 region:rollup2
AGO WHEN THESE ISSUES THAT

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:16.506 region:rollup2
FAILED TO BE RESOLVED YEAR AFTER

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:17.807 region:rollup2
YEAR AFTER YEAR. THE I RP WAS

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:21.177 region:rollup2
THE ONLY.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:23.179 region:rollup2
PLACE ARE ONLY BODY OUR PEOPLE

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:24.714 region:rollup2
COULD RAISE THESE CONCERNS SO

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:26.416 region:rollup2
THERE IS A BIG CONCERN ABOUT

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:28.418 region:rollup2
WHAT DO WE DO NOW. THE STATUS

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.819 region:rollup2
QUO HAS NOT WORKED FOR MANY

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.554 region:rollup2
DECADES FOR THESE COMMUNITIES.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:34.824 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THIS SAME ISSUE WITH

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:36.793 region:rollup2
THEM IS DEADLINES ON YES. SP SIX

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:37.694 region:rollup2

FAILED TO MEET THAT. OF HER

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:45.335 region:rollup2

AN EXPIRED PERMIT THAT EXPIRED

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:50.273 region:rollup2

01:06:49.072 --> 01:06:52.408 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH CLEAN UPS.

TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND TEN

01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:01.251 region:rollup2
YEARS LATER THE COMMUNITY WAS

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:04.354 region:rollup2
INFORMED. THAT WE HAVE THIS

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:06.089 region:rollup2
PATTERN OF LONG DELAYS.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:07.290 region:rollup2
INFORMATION GAPS AND

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:09.759 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES NOT HAVING ANYWHERE

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:10.693 region:rollup2
TO TURN. AND THE MOST

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:12.128 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:14.464 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT REALLY IN MY MIND

01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:16.833 region:rollup2
GOING TO. SOLVE THE PROBLEMS

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:18.301 region:rollup2
THAT DTS SEE UNLESS WE REALLY

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:20.103 region:rollup2
TACKLE THE STRUCTURE IN THE

01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:22.972 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING PROCESS. IT

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:24.073 region:rollup2
ISN'T INSULAR. AGENCY BUT YET IT

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:26.242 region:rollup2
IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.809 region:rollup2
AGENCIES IN TERMS OF PUBLIC

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:27.844 region:rollup2
HEALTH THAT WE HAVE IN THIS

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:30.980 region:rollup2

RESIDENCE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:42.125 region:rollup2

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:52.235 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO STANDARDS WHICH WE

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:54.504 region:rollup2
CAN APPLY AND THE APPEAL PROCESS

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:55.705 region:rollup2
IS BROKEN SO UNLESS WE REALLY

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:57.540 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:58.708 region:rollup2
AT DTS SEE I DON'T THINK WE'RE

GOING TO RESOLVE THINGS AND THIS

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:01.678 region:rollup2

PROCESS.

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:27.236 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS ONE THING IT WASN'T

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:28.671 region:rollup2
REALLY DISCUSSED HERE IN THE

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:30.506 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY BUT THERE IS ONE THING

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:31.307 region:rollup2
IN THE REPORT THAT WE DO. HAVE A

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:34.143 region:rollup2
BIT OF.

CONCERNED ABOUT AND THAT IS A

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:39.115 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION THAT THE

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:41.184 region:rollup2

HEARING BY INDUSTRY INTERESTS.

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:52.462 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE WAS LEGISLATION

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:53.863 region:rollup2
TO PUT THINGS INTO THE SAFER

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:56.099 region:rollup2
CONSUMER PRODUCTS RAKES THE

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:57.667 region:rollup2
REASON WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

THAT IS THAT WE'RE KIND OF

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:01.070 region:rollup2
FEELING STUCK IN CALIFORNIA WERE

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:03.406 region:rollup2
BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:05.775 region:rollup2

THE INNOVATION AND THE STAFF

01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:14.984 region:rollup2
WORKING ON IT. ARM THE REALITY

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:16.219 region:rollup2
IS HOWEVER THAT THAT IS A TEN

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.887 region:rollup2
YEAR PROGRAM THAT HAS NOT

01:09:16.219 --> 01:09:21.424 region:rollup2
PRODUCED A SINGLE ALTERNATIVE

01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:23.659 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS YET. IT IS PARTIALLY A

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:25.128 region:rollup2
RESOURCE ISSUE AND GETTING

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:27.563 region:rollup2
STARTED AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

01:09:25.128 --> 01:09:30.233 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS ALSO A PROGRAM THAT

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:31.968 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TIMID IN USING ITS OWN

01:09:30.233 --> 01:09:34.570 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO MOVE FORWARD. IN

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:36.339 region:rollup2
OUR OPINION. AND THAT IS WHY WE

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:38.408 region:rollup2
HAVE COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:39.442 region:rollup2
WITH SUPPORT FROM. FROM BOTH OF

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:41.711 region:rollup2
THE YOUR COMMITTEES.

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:43.579 region:rollup2
HAVE MOVE SOME LEGISLATION ON

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:45.448 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL POLICY. BUT WHAT I WANT

01:09:43.579 --> 01:09:47.717 region:rollup2
TO JUST BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION

01:09:45.448 --> 01:09:50.686 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE HEAR FROM DTS SEE AND

01:09:47.717 --> 01:09:52.722 region:rollup2
FROM AND FROM CAL EPA IS. DON'T

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:55.024 region:rollup2
MESS WITH MR OUR PROGRAM ITS

01:09:52.722 --> 01:09:56.259 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC. AND WE AGREE WITH IT

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:58.194 region:rollup2
IN A PERFECT WORLD THAT THAT'S

01:09:56.259 --> 01:10:00.229 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. BUT IT IS

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:02.498 region:rollup2
A DELIBERATIVE PROCESS IT WILL

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:04.033 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BE SLOW AND IT WAS NEVER

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:05.168 region:rollup2
MEANT TO ABROGATE THE THE

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:07.804 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

01:10:05.168 --> 01:10:10.273 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO AT TIMES TO TAKE.

01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:13.409 region:rollup2
ACTION ON CHEMICALS THAT ARE

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:14.844 region:rollup2
CAUSING SERIOUS EXPOSURES TO

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:17.847 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS AND.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:19.082 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE ERADICATED SO WE

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:20.650 region:rollup2
JUST WAIT BECAUSE WE HEAR FROM

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:23.352 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE GOT SAFER

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:24.120 region:rollup2
CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE HEAR FROM

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:25.688 region:rollup2
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.590 region:rollup2
DON'T MESS WITH US. AND

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:29.425 region:rollup2
NOTHING'S HAPPENING OKAY OKAY

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:34.964 region:rollup2
YOU VERY MUCH FRANK YOU RELEVANT

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:36.365 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY.

LEO ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.835 region:rollup2
A FIRST I AGREE WITH MANY OF THE

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:41.037 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT.

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:42.739 region:rollup2
MISPRINTS FROM MADE FROM CRP

01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:44.574 region:rollup2
ABOUT STRUCTURAL REFORM NEEDED

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:45.742 region:rollup2
TO TSC. BUT I MAINLY WANT TO

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:47.443 region:rollup2
STICK TO THE SAFER CONSUMER

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:49.345 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS PROGRAM AGREEING WITH

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:50.813 region:rollup2
THAT MS CENTER OF THAT IT'S

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:52.181 region:rollup2
MOVING WAY TOO SLOWLY. WAY

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:54.016 region:rollup2
LONGER THAN THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:54.917 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY INTENDED WHEN IT WAS

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.853 region:rollup2
PASSED.

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:58.888 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY MORE RESOURCES ARE

01:10:56.853 --> 01:11:00.823 region:rollup2
NEEDED. BUT WE WOULD DISAGREE

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:02.391 region:rollup2
WITH ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATION

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:03.860 region:rollup2
OR A COMMENT MADE BY THE R. P.

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:05.461 region:rollup2
WHICH IS MAYBE THEY SET

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.196 region:rollup2
UNREALISTIC DEADLINES AND THEY

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:08.765 region:rollup2
SHOULD SET. BEING A MORE

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:10.366 region:rollup2
REALISTIC AND SET ABOUT I DON'T

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:12.435 region:rollup2
THINK SO BECAUSE WE'RE GOING

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:15.071 region:rollup2
SLOW SLOWLY NOW. LET'S GET IT

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:16.439 region:rollup2
DONE FASTER LASTLY ON THE ISSUE

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:18.875 region:rollup2
OF THE LEGISLATURE TAKING.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:20.309 region:rollup2
ACTION IN LIEU OF OR INSTEAD OF

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:22.478 region:rollup2
IT'S PERFECTLY ALLOWABLE THE LAW

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:24.280 region:rollup2
NEVER SAYS THIS WILL BE THE SOLE

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:25.882 region:rollup2
PREROGATIVE OF THE. GREEN

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.551 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM TO DO THAT AND

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:29.886 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT DECADE

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:31.220 region:rollup2
OF THE PROGRAM I THINK THE

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:32.889 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO LOOK AT.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.758 region:rollup2
SINGLE CHEMICAL BAND BILLS WERE

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:36.926 region:rollup2
A A DIRTY WORD AFTER AWHILE BUT

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:39.061 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:41.497 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH SOONER

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:42.832 region:rollup2
THAN DTS HE IS ABLE TO UNTIL

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:44.200 region:rollup2
IT'S FULLY STAFFED UP OR

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:46.102 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOU DO THEY GET TO SO

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.503 region:rollup2
IT'S. MORE RAPID AND PROTECTING

01:11:46.102 --> 01:11:50.072 region:rollup2

COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA.

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.148 region:rollup2
I JUST LIKE TO COMMENT A LITTLE

01:11:58.614 --> 01:12:01.350 region:rollup2
BIT.

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:01.984 region:rollup2
AS THE TWO PREVIOUS SPEAKERS

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:03.986 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:06.989 region:rollup2
ON ELEMENTS OF.

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:09.325 region:rollup2
DTS THESE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:10.960 region:rollup2
SENT CENTRALLY AT ISSUE IN TERMS

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:12.495 region:rollup2
OF HAZARDOUS WASTE AND CLEAN UPS

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.931 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S. THE SAFER CONSUMER

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:16.766 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS PROGRAM AND ALSO.

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:17.133 region:rollup2
THE POLLUTION PREVENTION

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:19.802 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:21.103 region:rollup2
GIDEON HAD REFERENCED IN HIS

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:22.104 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY.

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:24.640 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:26.042 region:rollup2
DISAPPEARED. WE'VE SUPPORTED

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.476 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS.

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:29.779 region:rollup2
.

01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:30.813 region:rollup2
WE DIFFER WITH THE PREVIOUS TWO

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:33.449 region:rollup2
SPEAKERS IN TERMS OF.

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:35.451 region:rollup2
THE PACE OF THE STP THE SAFER

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:36.652 region:rollup2
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. IT

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:37.620 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN DELIBERATE IT'S BEEN

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:39.355 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.622 region:rollup2
WE DO THINK THAT SOME OF THAT

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.591 region:rollup2
IS.

01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:43.125 region:rollup2
RELATED TO.

01:12:41.591 --> 01:12:45.061 region:rollup2
MANPOWER QUESTIONS.

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:47.096 region:rollup2
SOME OF IT QUITE FRANKLY THOUGH

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:48.397 region:rollup2
IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT.

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:53.035 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A PIONEERING.

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:53.035 region:rollup2
REGULATION THE STATUTES WERE

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:56.639 region:rollup2
NEW TRAILS HERE.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:58.074 region:rollup2
COVERING NEW GROUND FROM A

01:12:56.639 --> 01:13:00.109 region:rollup2
REGULATORY STANDPOINT.

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:01.377 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK IT'S BEEN AN

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:05.681 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY DELIBERATE.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:07.583 region:rollup2
PROCESS. I ALSO BELIEVE AND I

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:08.417 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS A COMMONLY. SHARED

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:10.953 region:rollup2
BELIEF.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:12.388 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE POISED TO MOVE

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:14.357 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE RAPIDLY.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:17.960 region:rollup2
NOW THAT THEY'VE GOT THEIR.

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:20.496 region:rollup2
INITIAL SEVERAL. PRODUCTS.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.965 region:rollup2
MOVING AND THEY'VE HAD THE

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:24.767 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF THAT PROCESS.

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:26.669 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO ALSO.

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:27.570 region:rollup2
MENTION RELATED CONCERN NOW AND

01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:30.640 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:31.974 region:rollup2
THAT AS WE ATTEND TO THE

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.342 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WHICH WE CERTAINLY

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:35.444 region:rollup2
DON'T DISPUTE.

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:37.246 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED HERE

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:38.914 region:rollup2
TODAY I THINK WE CAN'T LOSE

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:40.349 region:rollup2
SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT DTS HE

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:42.551 region:rollup2
HAS A LARGER SUITE OF.

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:43.619 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES AND.

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:45.855 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:49.358 region:rollup2
DO NEED TO BE TAKEN.

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:52.328 region:rollup2
INTO COGNIZANCE AS WE CONSIDER.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:54.931 region:rollup2
HOW TO REMEDY THE PROBLEMS WE

01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:57.266 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE? RADICAL

01:13:54.931 --> 01:14:02.071 region:rollup2
STEPS TAKEN. THAT ARE DRIVEN.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:03.973 region:rollup2
LARGELY BY A HANDFUL OF SITES

01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:05.207 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE.

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:08.778 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:10.780 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD. MAKE CHANGES THAT

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:13.582 region:rollup2
WOULD UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.784 region:rollup2
THE LARGER SUITE OF ACTIVITY

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.985 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.652 region:rollup2

SPEAKING TO THAT PROGRAM WE

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.862 region:rollup2
COULD CERTAINLY.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.864 region:rollup2
I'LL BE TAKING THAT FURTHER

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:29.632 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT. TOP PERHAPS WITH MY

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:30.733 region:rollup2

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:52.054 region:rollup2
THE PERMITTING ISSUES. I'D LIKE

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:53.556 region:rollup2
TO RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK AND

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:54.890 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT WENT INTO THE I RP

MILITARY BROUGHT TO THEM. AND WE
