THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE. NOW I'M MOVING ON TO OUR HEARING INCREASING PRESCRIBED FIRE IN CALIFORNIA I WAS GONNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS AND THEN TURN TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO I'M SURE WILL WANT TO ADD THEIR OWN COMMENTS SO WE ALL KNOW THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY THIS YEAR WILDFIRES CONTINUE TO HAVE HUGE IMPACTS ON ALL CALIFORNIANS. ARE PRETTY AIR QUALITY NATURAL RESOURCES PEOPLE'S VERY LIVES AND OF COURSE OUR TREASURED OPEN SPACE AND PARKS- I HAVE BEEN HEAVILY IMPACTED. A RECENTLY I PARTICIPATED IN AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING PUT ON BY THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB THREE ON WILDFIRE MITIGATION MEASURES. THAT AS FOCUSED ON WILDFIRE MITIGATION TO THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE. AT TODAY'S HERE IS GOING TO FOCUS ON ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN DEALING WITH CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE RISK WHICH IS PRESCRIBED BURNING. INCLUDING CULTURAL BURNING. ASCRIBE FIRE USED UNDER THE CORRECT CONDITIONS CAN RESTORE RESILIENCE TO OUR FORESTS IN WAYS THAT WILL REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES AND INDEED IS WE'RE GONNA HERE. THEY WERE AT ONE POINT A VERY REGULAR AND NATURAL PART OF OUR FOREST ECOSYSTEM. IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM ISSUED AN APOLOGY. THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA TO HELP TO CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S FOR THE MANY INSTANCES OF VIOLENCE MISTREATMENT AND NEGLECT. INFLICTED UPON A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S HISTORY. PART OF THIS MISTREATMENT WAS ACTIVELY STOPPING CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS FOR MANAGING THEIR LAND IN A WAY THAT PROVIDED FOR THEIR PEOPLE. AND REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE RISK. HOPEFULLY IN ADDITION TO OTHER ACTIONS THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCOUNT FOR HISTORICAL WRONGS. THE STATE CAN ALSO TAKE MEANINGFUL STEPS TO SUPPORT THE RESTORATION OF CULTURAL BURNING. IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS BOTH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS AND REDUCES OUR STATE'S WILDFIRE RISK. I WANT TO THANK MY VICE CHAIR HE FLORA ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM WOOD FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE HEARING TODAY AS WELLAS ANYBODY WHO WILL BE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. AND I WANT TO SEE. IF ANY OF EITHER OF YOU HAVE ANY OPENING STATEMENTS. MISTER WOULD. WELL FIRST OFF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO PARTICIPATE I HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN THIS. MY DISTRICT HAS EXPERIENCED A MORE THAN ITS SHARE OF WILDFIRES- IN RECENT YEARS THE TUBBS FIRE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH BECAME THE LARGEST FIRE IN STATE HISTORY- AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. AND NOW THE- THE AUGUST COMPLEX BUYERS THAT. I HAVE HAPPENED NOW CLIPS OVER A MILLION ACRES- IN IN MY DISTRICT SO HAVE THE DUBIOUS HONOR OF HAVING SOME OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE. OF THAT HAVE TOUCHED THE SECOND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND SO- THE COULD THE AREA OF PRESCRIBED FIRE IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME AND OF GREAT INTEREST- I SPENT- THE INTERIM- MEETING WITH PEOPLE- ABOUT PRESCRIBED FIRE- IT IS CHALLENGING TO DO PRESCRIBE FIRE IN IT IS- IT IS CHALLENGING ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS AND- AND I WILL HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK PART OF IT IS. US WE AS GOVERNMENT HAVE GOTTEN IN THE WAY AND MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DO PRESCRIBED FIRE AND WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN IN A MEANINGFUL WAY- THIS FRIDAY I'M ACTUALLY GOING UP INTO- THE NORTHERN PART OF MY DISTRICT TO VISIT WITH THE- TROUBLE MEMBERS FROM THE KARUK TRIBE- WHO DO A LOT OF PRESCRIBED FIRE- WORK. AND LEARN TO LEARN FROM THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPEDIMENTS THEY HAVE- THEY ARE UNIQUELY SITUATED AND THEN THAT PART OF THEIR- PART THEY THEY JOINED NATIONAL FOREST AS WELL AS STATE LANDS. AND THEY HAVE YET THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND I WANT TO LEARN FROM THEM AND SEE WHAT WE CAN BRING BACK HOPEFULLY IMPLEMENT HERE SO I JUST I JUST THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PRESENTATIONS. THANK YOU BUT YOUR CAR THINK ABOUT YOUR REPORT THIS- HEARING ON AND DOCTOR WOULD IT'S BEEN A- YOUR DISTRICT HAS CERTAINLY GONE THROUGH A LOT- MY BACKGROUND COMING PRIOR TO THE LEGISLATOR- I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND THIS IS BEEN A SUBJECT THAT HAS BEEN VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEART BECAUSE I DO THINK WE HAVE- COMPLETELY MESSED UP AS GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM OUR NATIVE AMERICAN FRIENDS- ON FOR DECADES HOW THEY CONTROLLED. THE VEGETATION WITHIN THEIR TRIBAL LANDS AND I THINK WE COULD EXPAND ON THAT. SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS HEARING I THINK IT'S. A GREAT FIRST STEP FORWARD BECAUSE- FOR YEARS I'M I LOVE TO STATE TO THE- AND EIGHT. AND IT WAS OVERGROWN THEN. AND WE HAVE A DECADE PLUS TWO YEARS OF GROWTH ON TOP OF THAT. AND WE STILL HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING EVERY YEAR. OUR FIREFIGHTERS ARE FACED WITH CAREER FIRES. AND NOTHING SEEMS TO CHANGE SO THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP I'M PROUD TO BE HERE. AND I'M EXCITED TO WHERE WE CAN GO FROM HERE BECAUSE WE DO WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM A NATIVE AMERICAN FRIENDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BECAUSE WE HAVE- SEVERAL PANELS AND A LOT OF SPEAKERS AND A LOT OF INFORMATION WE'RE GONNA BE LIMITING. THE TIME FOR EACH WITNESS. TO SEVEN MINUTES AND I WOULD ASK THE WITNESSES TO. PLEASE TRY TO RESPECT THAT IN AND- B. AS JUDICIOUS AS YOU CAN WITH YOUR TIME. SO I'M GONNA INTRODUCE AND WELCOME OUR FIRST PANEL TO GIVE US BACKGROUND AN OVERVIEW ON PRESCRIBED FIRE IN CALIFORNIA. WELCOME TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES ANYWAY LIKE- BUT WE WILL HAVE SCOTT STEVENS PROFESSOR FIRE. SCIENCE HENRY J. PHELPS DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR IN FOREST POLICY. MERRY PRINT A KEEP. WHO'S A PHD AND MD AND DIRECTOR OF AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH RESEARCH. MYSTERON IN PARKER CENTER FOR ALLERGY AND ASTHMA RESEARCH AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY. AND LENA QUINN DAVIDSON WHO'S THE AREA FIRE ADVISOR FROM UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION- WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. AND I BELIEVE MISTER STEVENS- PROFESSOR STEVENS WILL BE SPEAKING FIRST. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY. AT THE ARE MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY- I APPRECIATE THE- JUNIOR EFFORT IN THE FIRE AREA. I THINK IF I COULD PLEASE GET THIS GO TO MY FIRST LINE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE ONLY HAVE TO. I THINK IT'S ON OUR SCREEN WE CAN SEE IT OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T SEE IT SO- HERE'S A PICTURE OF YOUR RECEIPT CALIFORNIA BLODGETT FORCE RESEARCH STATION A PRESCRIBED FIRE I GET SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND HERE YOU CAN TO SEE CERTAINLY SOME OTHER STORY FLAMES AND SOME THINGS THAT ARE WORKING FOR US- I WOULD JUST SAY UP THERE IN THE LEFT CORNER WE'VE GOT THREE PRESCRIBED FIRE SCHEDULED FOR THIS FALL BLOCK IT. WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO- WITH ROB YORK ANOTHER TO GET THESE THINGS DONE AND WE'RE STILL KIND OF IN I'M KIND OF IN THE QUEUE. AND THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS JUST TRYING TO GET CONDITIONS ARE GOOD. I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE IN LIKE THE SECOND SLIDE BUT RIGHT NOW WE DON'T REALLY SEE A WINDOW OR WE CAN DO OUR THREE PRESCRIBED FIRES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT- OUR. WEATHER IS WORKED OUT THIS YEAR. BUT I ALSO WOULD SAY THAT. I REALLY HAVE APPLAUD STATE THE STATE OKAY. HAS TAKEN. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. TO BRING THIS FRONT AND CENTER. THE LAST YEAR THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION INTO THE NEWS MY MINISTRATION WE'VE SEEN DRAMATIC. EMPHASIS ON FIRE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I REALLY APPLAUD THIS EFFORT BECAUSE FRANKLY MY THIRTY YEAR CAREER THIS IS NOT HAPPENED AT THE STATE LEVEL- WE'RE LOOKING MUCH MORE PROACTIVELY NOW PURSUE TRYING TO CERTAINLY. FOCUS ON DEPRESSION AND OTHER THINGS BUT- I WANT TO APPLAUD THE STATE'S EFFORTS. AND I THINK WHAT THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I'M NOT TALK A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT WHERE WE'RE HEADED TO MAYBE- SOME IDEAS AND SOME THINGS TO. CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO FIRST YOU SEE ON TOP HER BILLS WELL I WANT TO BRING VISIBLE UP FOR A MOMENT IS ALL OF MY PREDECESSOR UC BERKELEY HE WAS A- PROFESSOR FIRE. ECOLOGY AT BERKELEY. YOU GOTTA NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN RETIRED NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. BY NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT HE HAD BEEN WORKING SEVEN YEARS PRESCRIBED BURNING IN CALIFORNIA FORCED. ANYONE TO PAPER IN FIFTY EIGHT THAT SAID WE NEED TO START DOING THIS. IMAGINE NOT NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT. SO LAW WAS ACTUALLY SOMEONE THAT LOOK FORWARD HE WANTED TO USE FIRE. HE'S WORK INITIALLY WITH ALL ON- STATE. AND DON'T SHOOT ME WAS ON PRIVATE LAND DEFERRED FORCING HOPE WORKS. AT THE TIME NO STATE OR FEDERAL. WORK MANAGER. BURKE SO WE LOOK AT ON KIND OF THE EARLY PART OF HOW TO PRESCRIBE BURNING HERE IN. IT WAS REALLY FIRST DONE ALL PRIVATE LANDS. SO THERE WAS STRONG AGREEMENT- ABOUT HOW TO DO THE SOME OF THIS WORK FROM A FEW INDIVIDUALS BUT- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WAS A GIANT MISSED OPPORTUNITY OF. THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES BY THE MID NINETEEN SIXTIES BILLS WELL HAVE BASICALLY COME FORWARD ASSEMBLY REALLY NEED TO DO THIS EARNERS BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE SOME ISSUES SUCH AS FELS. WE HAVE A WHILE AGO NEVER FACE ISSUE AND OTHERS SO I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT POINT BUT I WOULD JUST SAY WE'RE WE'VE GOT SOME HISTORY ON THIS TOPIC AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE OPPORTUNITY I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT MORE. PEOPLE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING COOPERATIVELY FIVE PLOT THAT. FUNDS UNDER THE WORKFORCE. WE DO NOT HAVE A FORCE OF WORKFORCE PRESCRIBED FIRE IN THIS STATE SOMETHING I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS ON. BOTH SIDE OF SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND SENATOR WYDEN IN THE U. S. SENATE HAVE BILLS TO ADDRESS THIS BOTH OF THEM WERE CALLING FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE TRAINING CENTER IN THE WESTERN U. S. I APPLAUD THAT EFFORT. TALLAHASSEE FLORIDA HAS ONE OF THOSE ALREADY HAS ACTUALLY WORKED FOR DECADES TO REALLY INCREASE THE YOUNG. WORK FORCE. THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO DO OUT HERE. WE NEED TO BURN OUTSIDE THE WILDFIRE SEASON MY FIRST LINE ALLUDED TO WE GOT THREE PRESCRIBED FIRES THIS YEAR IN THE QUEUE. WE REALLY CAN'T GET HIM DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE WILDFIRE SEASON. BUT WINTER AND SPRING OUR GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO DO BURNING IN THE STATE. OTHERS SAY YOU KNOW FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY NO IT'S NOT THAT LONG AGO. MAYBE REMEMBER FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY WE NEED ANY RAIN OR ANY SNOW IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. TALK ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO PRESCRIBED BURNING AT SCALE. I THINK THERE WAS A LOT WE HAVE TO TAE BECAUSE WE'RE NEVER GONNA DO. ACRES AND THAT SCALE WE NEED UNLESS WE REALLY OPEN UP SOME OF THESE PERIODS TO BURNING. BECAUSE JUST LIKE RIGHT NOW WITH OUR THREE FIRES WERE A LITTLE BIT STYMIED BUT IF YOU HAVE A WHOLE MONTH IN FEBRUARY WHEN IT'S RELATIVELY DRY. YOU CAN REALLY TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY. AT THAT TIME MOST OF OUR FIREFIGHTING FORCES ARE COMPLETELY GONE. YEAH THIS IS OUTSIDE THE FIRE SEASON THAT'S WHY WE NEED A DEDICATED PRESCRIBE FAR WORKING FOR CHRIS TAKE OPPORTUNITIES. MAYBE ON THE SCALE 2225% OF OUR SUPPRESSION FORCE MAYBE THAT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT EFFORT. FLORIDA HAS BEEN A LEADER PRESCRIBED BURNING FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND I HAVE TO TIP MY HAT TO THEM ALSO GEORGIA ANOTHER. AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEY HAD A VERY BAD EVENT. PRESCRIBED FIRE WAS DONE I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER. A FEW DAYS LATER IT REKINDLED THUNDERSTORM CAME IN AND BASICALLY MOVE THIS FAR INTO URBAN AREA BURNED DOWN THIRTY SIX HOUSES. ONE THING YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS IS CERTAINLY A TRAGEDY. BUT ONE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. WE DIDN'T EVEN HEAR ABOUT IT OUT HERE. WHAT HAPPENED WAS IS THAT. THEY HAVE SUCH A MATURE PROGRAM WOULD ENABLE THEM TO GET THROUGH THAT TRAGIC EVENT. AND CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. CAN YOU IMAGINE THIRTY SIX HOUSES NO ONE WAS HURT. NO ONE WAS KILLED THAT'S GREAT BUT THIRTY SIX HOUSES BURNED IN A PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT REKINDLES AFTER A FEW DAYS AND THE SYSTEM CONTINUES OPERATES. THEY JUST HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE STRONG PROGRAM WITH A LOT OF HISTORY. THE LIABILITY COVERAGE IS ONE OF THE KEYS TO FLORIDA'S PROGRAM. AND EVEN MYSELF IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I WORKING ON SEVEN PRESCRIBED FIRES OF BLODGETT FORCE RESEARCH STATION. TWO THREE DAYS LATER ONE OF THEM REKINDLED WE HAVE ESCAPED. THE FOR SERVER GEORGETOWN RANGER DISTRICT CAME IN AS A PRESS THAT FILE WORSE BECAUSE WE HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN. SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF EVENTS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. I JUST THINK WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS WE GO FOR WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT TO. REALLY GET TO STYMIE THE WHOLE PROGRAM OUT THE GATE. AS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS I GUARANTEE IT. WHAT AUSTRALIA A- AREA OF THE I. OF THE WORD. WITH THE LARGEST PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. HAS A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE JUST LIKE US. RICH NEED JACK IS THE HEAD OF THE PRESCRIBER PROGRAM YOU WORKED THERE FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS. THEY BROUGHT UP THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR ROUND PERTH. HE CAME OVER HERE SEVERAL YEARS AGO I TOOK HIM UP AND DOWN THE STATEMENT WITH A BUNCH OF MANAGERS. HE HAD SOME OBSERVATIONS- IN QUOTES WE BEGIN WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT FUEL LOADED LANDSCAPES. ARE LANDSCAPE ARE IN TOP CONDITION WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MOSAIC OF FUEL TO BASE WITH WORK WITH. AS THEY DO SAY IN WESTERN AUSTRALIAAND ALSO IN FLORIDA. SO WE BEGIN AT A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION FROM A LANDSCAPE PERSPECTIVE. WE ALSO HAVE THE LOWEST EXPERIENCE AND POLITICAL SUPPORT THERE'S ANOTHER QUOTE FROM RICK. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BRING ALONG BOTH THE PUBLIC AND ALSO INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AS WE HAVE. GROWING PAINS THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO REALLY ADDRESS. WE CAN USE THE WILDFIRES THAT HAVE HAPPENED THE LAST FEW YEARS AS THE MOST SAY IT. IS NOT THE MOSAIC WE REALLY WOULD LIKE. BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN USE THEM TO ACTUALLY BUILD A PROGRAM ON. I GAVE A TALK ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO TO THE NAPA COUNTY VINEYARD ASSOCIATION BECAUSE THEY ARE SO. INTERESTED IN ALSO TRYING TO. REDUCE NEGATIVE IMPACTS FROM SMOKE TAINT AND OTHER THINGS. SIERRA NEVADA NORTH COAST. SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WE GOT A MOSAIC WE CAN USE. INTERAGENCY COOPERATION WILL BE KEY INDIGENOUS BURNING I THINK IS REALLY AS I'VE HEARD ALREADY IS A KEY POINT. IN JUST BURNING COULD BE A- BUNCH OF INNOVATION IF THE TRIBES CHOSE TO WORK WITH US IT'S UP TO THEM. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY AND TO JUST BRING COULD BE A KEY UP AND DOWN THE STATE. I SAY ONE TO TWO DECADES WE GOT ONE TO TWO DECADES TO REALLY CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY WE DON'T DO THAT. I'M AFRAID THE WILD LANDS ARE GONNA CHANGE RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES. I'M OPTIMISTIC. BUT WE HAVE TO MOVE DECISIVELY. WITHOUT ALL IN MY- THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AFTER THE OTHER PANELISTS SPEAK. NEXT WE. HAVE DOCTOR PRETTY. THANK YOU I MIGHT. REYES GO. WE ARE CHECKING OUT RIGHT NOW GETTING LOADED. OKAY OKAY OKAY. WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT I JUST LIKE TO THE KNOWLEDGE MY OUR COLLEAGUE AL MURATSUCHI WHO I BELIEVE HAS JOINED US OF. VIRTUAL. OKAY THE SLIDES ARE UPLOADED. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES PERSIST PRESCRIBED BURNS- IF WE COULD GO TO THE SECOND SIDE PLEASE. AN OBVIOUS CONCERN WITH ANY TYPE OF FIRE SMOKE INHALATION. AND HERE IN THE SIDE WE SEE THAT WILDFIRE SMOKE PLUMES CONTEST WELL THE CONFLICT PRIMARILY A FEW KEY POINTS FIVE AND THESE CLAIMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO STAY ALOFT AND TRAVEL DISTANCES. TO COMPARISON TO THE LARGER PIECES OF ASH THAT SETTLE TO THE GROUND AND DON'T TRAVEL THAT'S- HOWEVER. YOU CAN ON THE PALM THE WHETHER THE PM TWO POINT FIVE CLOUT POLLUTION MOVED DOWNWARD IN BETA READING SPACE. AND WE KNOW ESPECIALLY HIGH- MORE RECENTLY THE WILDFIRE SMOKE CAN TRAVEL LARGE DISTANCES AND INCREASE THE RISK OF HEALTH AND TAX- WENDY PARTICULATE MATTER IS INHALED THE SIZE DETERMINES HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN YOUR RESPIRATORY TRACT. THE LARGER PM TEN ONLY TRAVELS PART WAY DOWN. BUT THE PM TWO POINT FIVE AND EVEN SMALLER PARTICLES CAN TRAVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN TO LEVEL DALY L. C. A LISTED IS AT THE BASE OF YOUR LONG. AND CROSS INTO YOUR CIRCULATION. RIGHT PLEASE. ON A GLOBAL SCALE THE POLICE SHOULD BE POPULATION HEALTH RISK FROM WILDFIRES CAN RANGE FROM SUBCLINICAL IMPACT- WITH NO OBVIOUS SYMPTOMS TO DEATH. AND B. WILDFIRE AND HEALTH LITERATURE MOST CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASED RISK OF ASTHMA RELATED EVENTS AFTER WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE- THIS IS MAKE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE- THERE'S ALSO INCREASES AND OTHER RESPIRATORY OUTCOMES LIKE INCREASES IN OUR EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR COPD AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS. POSITION VISITS AND ASSOCIATED MEDICATION USE. IN ADDITION THERE'S INCREASES IN CARDIOVASCULAR. SUCH AS HEART ATTACKS A RADIUS. RT ACT REST AND EVEN THERE ARE A LOT OUTCOME SUCH AS SMOKE FIRST STROKE WHEN WE WHILE TRY SMOKE IN THE EVENT ARE DEPENDENT ON THE LAW OF TIME THE SMOKE INHALE AND THE- OF THE SMOKE. IN ADDITION TO THE AGE IN THE PRE EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS OF AN INDIVIDUAL. SO THE INTENSITY INTO OF THIS YEAR'S WILDFIRE BUMPER. AND THERE'S ACTIVE RESEARCH IN TRYING TO DETERMINE. THE HEALTH IMPACTS THAT IT WILL HAPPEN EVERYONE- ON EVERYONE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE WHY DID THAT THE IMPACT OF PM TWO POINT FIVE ACTUALLY COMES FROM THE AIR CARE THE TRAILER BACK LET ME JUST WILDFIRE I'M SORRY DOT EIGHTY OF WILD DOCTORS DO YOU HAVE A- I JUST pOF FEEDBACK DO YOU HAVE A MONITOR THAT'S PLAYING THIS I CAN HEAR THAT ALSO OKAY. NO I DON'T OKAY- COLLEGE AND. WE JUST TRIED CLOSING MY- BUT MAKE HER CLOSING MY BROWSER IN CASE. SECOND OKAY LET'S SEE IF THAT PROVES THAT. SO FROM THE AIR POLLUTION- LITERATURE WE KNOW THAT PM TWO POINT FIVE IS EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL TO OUR HEALTH AND ITS ROLE BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUTTHE WILDFIRES BECAUSE OVER 80% OF WILDFIRE SMOKE IS TYPICALLY PM TWO POINT FIVE. ONCE THE DINNER THE ENTERS THE BODY. AND CROSSES IT AT THE LEVEL BE. OF THE LONG IT CAN TRAVEL THROUGHOUT BECAUSE WIDESPREAD IMPACT. SO NOT ONLY CAN THERE BE RESPIRATORY CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS LIKE WE MENTIONED BUT ALSO- CANCER. AND ASSOCIATE IMMUNE SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION IS ASSOCIATED. WITH EXPOSURE TO PM TWO POINT FIVE THE ACTUAL BIOLOGY OF THE POLLUTION EXPOSURE TO IT'S AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION. IF WE COULD GO TO FLIGHT FIVE. FOR EXAMPLE- GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESCRIBED BURNING A WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT WE WANTED TO EXAMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE DIFFERENTIAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES BETWEEN A PRESCRIBED FIRE VERSIONS OF WILDFIRE. AND WE HAD ALREADY COLLECTED SAMPLE BLOOD SAMPLES FROM CHILDREN LIVING IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA AND- RETROSPECTIVELY WE LOOK TO SEE WHETHER SUBJECT- HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO EITHER A WILDFIRE OR PRESCRIBED BURNS ARE. AT LEAST THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE BLOOD DRAW- AND THE FIRE TO FIRES ARE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND DURATION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT WHAT CHILDREN FIT THE- CATEGORY WE FOUND THAT THERE ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY EIGHT YEAR OLDS THAT HAD BEEN EXPOSED HER SURGERY BURN IN YOUR SO MANY. AND ABOUT THIRTY SIX CHILDREN EXPOSED TO WILDFIRE OF ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND THEN- DURATION. THE FIRE SERVICE WHERE ABOUT SEVENTY MILES AWAY- THERE WAS ALSO A CONTROL GROUP FROM THE BAY AREA THE HADN'T THEY EXPOSED TO ANYTHING- SMOKE AT ALL. AND WE- ON THE RIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE GRAFT WE ANALYZED THE LEVEL OF. PM TWO POINT FIVE BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THE PRESCRIBED BURNS IN THE WILDFIRES- USING SATELLITE MONITORS- ENTRANCE NO ITSELF. AND THEN WE DISTRICTS WEIGHTED THE EXPOSURE BASED ON WHERE THE PARTICIPANT LIVES. THE GREAT SHOWS THE AVERAGE AMOUNT PM POINT. EITHER DURING THE FIRST ANOTHER WILD. AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE WILDFIRE PRESUMABLY GENERATED MORE POLLUTION THAN THE PRESCRIBED BURN. I SAY PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THE FEDERAL SITE MINDERS CAN'T DISCRIMINATE THE SOURCE OF THE POLLUTION SO THE SOURCE OF PM TWO POINT FIVE BUT THE PATTERN- SHOULD THE TIMING OF THE FIRES THEMSELVES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHEN ANALYZING THE BLOOD WE FOUND THAT DAY THE EXPOSURE TO THE WILDFIRE- WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE NEW DYSFUNCTION THAN THOSE EXPOSED TO EITHER THE PRESCRIBED BURNS OR- THE CONTROL GROUP WHICH WERE NOT EXPOSED TO FIRE AT ALL. THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR FINDINGS FROM AIR POLLUTION STUDIES. AND IT'S ALSO CONSISTENT WITH ANOTHER STUDY WHERE WE LOOKED AT TEENAGERS FROM PRESS NOW EXPOSED TO A WILD FIRE- AGAIN IN YOSEMITE AND WE WERE ABLE TO SEE- INCREASES AND TWO TYPES OF INFLAMMATORY MARKERS IN THE BLOOD- AFTER EXPOSURE- AND BOTH OF THESE INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH POLLUTION EXPOSURE PRIOR. SO WE KNOW THAT SMOKE IMPACTS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM EVEN IN CHILDREN. AND THAT THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES ARE STILL NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD- WE DON'T REALLY KNOW FOR THESE CHILDREN OR TEENAGERS IN THE FUTURE HOW THIS WILL IMPACT FOR EXAMPLE- THERE ARE RISKS FOR ADULT CHRONIC DISEASE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. CERTIFIED CHOSEN DATA HARMON JAFFE IN WHICH THEY COMPARED THE SIZE IN THE MANICHEAN TWO POINT FIVE GENERATED FROM ALL FROM WILDFIRES PERSIST PRESCRIBED BURNS IN DIFFERENT STATES. AND AS YOU CAN SEE- RESPECT THE AREA BURNED. THERE WAS MORE PM TWO POINT FIVE WHETHER MEASURED BY A MONTH OR DALY- YEAH DURING- WILDFIRE STAND PRESCRIBED BURNS. AND THIS IS JUST TO- TISSUE THAT WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR VERY SMALL- STUDY IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE LITERATURE. SO ALTHOUGH THE AREAS BURNED BY THE PRESCRIBED FIRES WERE COMPARED BOTH TO THE WILD FIRE AREAS BURNED IN THE WEST THE PM TWO POINT FOUR FIVE EMISSIONS LOWER. ON THE AUTHORS FEEL THE DIFFERENCES DUE TO BOTH THE FIELD IN THE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE THE SIMPSONS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE THE PROFESSOR COMING UP PASS SOME MINUTES IF YOU CAN TRY TO DO THIS QUICKLY AND WRAP IT UP. THANK YOU. OKAY HOW DO I GET THIS VERY QUICKLY- WE CAN. PRESCRIBE SIZE ABOUT FIRES THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT. FIRST THE COMPOSITION OF THE POLLUTION- FOR EXAMPLE PM TWO POINT FIVE DEPENDS ON THE SOURCE OF WHAT'S BEING BURNED. SO THAT PAKISTAN WHILE LIBERTY MAY BE VERY WELL LEFT TOXIC TO THE HEALTH. AND AN OUT OF CONTROL WILDFIRE THAT ACTUALLY BURNING ACCOUNT OF BURNING UP CLEANING PRODUCTS AND MULTI PLASTICS. THAT ARE- THERE'S OBVIOUS DISTANCES AND THE- D. DEFICIT THAT'S NOT TRAVELS FOR PRESCRIBERS OF THOSE WILDFIRES THE TIMING AND STRATEGY- CURLY IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES. I THEN THE AN INNER IS THE FACT THE- FIRES IT'S POSSIBLE TO PROACTIVELY PLAN AND MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO ANY- POPULATIONS IN ANY INCONVENIENCE TO THE PUBLIC. SO MY LAST SLIDE IS THE SUMMARY SLIDE. IN SUMMARY WILDFIRE SMOKE- INDEED MANY TOXINS THAT PREDOMINATES PM TWO POINT FIVE WE KNOW THAT PM TWO POINT FIVE MISTER SHADED WITH INCREASED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY- AND WE'RE FINDING OUT MORE MORE- AS WE DO MORE WILDFIRE RESEARCH- AND IN OUR STUDY WE EVEN SHOW THE NEW CHILDREN IT CAN BE MORE DETRIMENTAL TO. YOUR HEALTH- WILDFIRES CANDY THEN TOOK A SCRIBE BURKE- KEVIN SUMMARY PRESCRIBED BURNS IN AND- AND YOU KNOW BASED ON OUR RESEARCH. HAS MANY ADVANTAGES OVER- THE- ALTERNATIVE TO THE COMPLEX OF WILDFIRES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL COME BACK TO THE QUESTIONS AFTER THE NEXT A PANELIST. OKAY AND LEADING QUINN DAVIDSON WILL BE. BRINGING THIS PANEL HOME. WE CAN YOU WELL. OKAY GREAT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY MY NAME'S LAINNYA QUINN DAVIDSON AND I AM THE AREA FIRED VISOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION UP IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PRESCRIBED FIRE COUNCIL AND- I REALLY APPRECIATED WHAT SCOTT HAD TO SAY I THINK HE DID A GREAT JOB SETTING UP THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OR AT LEAST THE MORE RECENT HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE MASSIVE- SCALE OF THE NEED FOR MORE PRESCRIBED FIRE ON OUR LANDSCAPES I ALSO REALLY LIKE TO BE SAID ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN THE YEAR IF YOU'RE AROUND NEED FOR WORK FORCE ON THIS ISSUE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY BE FOCUSED ON I AM GOING TO USE MY TIME TO SPEAK A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICALLY TO SOME OF THE BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT I SEE WITH REGARD TO COMMUNITY BASED- PRESCRIBED FIRE AND PRIVATE LANDS ISSUES. AND I GUESS I WANT TO START OFF JUST BY TALKING ABOUT THE HUGE GROUNDSWELL OF INTEREST AND PRESCRIBED FIRE AT THE COMMUNITY SCALE THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN RECENT YEARS IT'S REALLY KIND OF UNPRECEDENTED FOR RECENT DECADES THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE STARTED THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY PRESCRIBED BURN ASSOCIATION WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A COMMUNITY COOPERATIVE FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE- WE WERETHE FIRST OF OUR KIND IN THE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE WESTERN U. S. AND- YOU KNOW WE THERE AT THAT TIME THERE WERE SOME NGOS- SOME TRIBES AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WERE DOING SOME BURNING BUT REALLY PRESCRIBED FIRE FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN. OWNED BY FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND THERE HADN'T BEEN A LOT OF SPACE FOR COMMUNITIES FOR TRIBES- AND FOR PRIVATE FOLKS TO HAVE A YOU KNOW HAVE A KEY ROLE IN PRESCRIBED FIRE NOT THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM I'M JUST THREE YEARS LATER NOW THERE ARE TWELVE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY BASED PRESCRIBED BURN ASSOCIATION STYLE GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE- WE HAVE THESE TYPES OF GROUPS FORMED UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA FROM HUMBLE AND SISKIYOU COUNTIES ALLTHE WAY DOWN TO PHYLLIS OBISPO AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES. AND FROM CINEMA AND MENDOCINO ALL THE WAY TO PLUMAS AND SEQUOIA LAW OF OTHER. IN BETWEEN SO THERE'S JUST A HUGE. GRANTS WHAT GROUNDS FULL OF INTEREST IN THIS KIND OF WORK. AND TRIBES ARE ALSO REINVIGORATING THEIR CULTURAL PRACTICES AND THEIR PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAMS WHICH WE'LL HEAR ABOUT FROM BILL AND MARGOT A LITTLE LATER IN THIS HEARING. AND LANDOWNERS FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING RANCHERS AND TIMBER LAND OWNERS AND BACK TO THE LANDERS AND EVEN RESIDENTS IN WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREAS. ARE REALLY DEMANDING THAT PRESCRIBED FIRE BE BROUGHT BACK INTO THEIR TOOL BOX. SO I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR ACTION AND COMMITMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL ON THIS ISSUE. AND THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO ENABLE AND EMPOWER COMMUNITIES AND TRIBES AND- AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO GET MORE INVOLVED AND TO NOT ONLY BE PARTNERS BUT REALLY TO BE LEADERS IN THIS WORK. SO THAT'S YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO PROLIFERATE PRESCRIBED FIRE THE SCALE THAT'S ACTUALLY. MEANINGFUL AND- AND CAN RESTORE OUR ECOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL VALUES. THEN WE NEED TO WE NEED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND REALLY POUR SOME ENERGY INTO IT. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY PLACES LIKE FLORIDA AND GEORGIA- WE SEE THAT THEY HAVE CERTIFIED BURNER PROGRAMS AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY LAWS. AND SOME WESTERN STATES LIKE WASHINGTON AND COLORADO HAVE ALSO MORE RECENTLY ADOPTED- DIFFERENT NEGLIGENCE STANDARDS THAT GO ALONG WITH CERTIFIED BURNER PROGRAMS. AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE IN CALIFORNIA PASSED SENATE BILL TWELVE SIXTY WHICH MANDATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE CERTIFIED BURN BOSS PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL- I SERVED ON THE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE FOR THAT PROGRAM. AND I'M PRETTY PLEASED WITH THE LEVEL OF RIGOR AND THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK IN OUR PROGRAM TO PRESCRIBED FIRE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION- IT WILL ROLL OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROBABLY IN MID SPRING. NOW THE STATE CERTIFIED BURN BOSS PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED IS REALLY INTENDED FOR EXPERIENCED PRESCRIBED FIRE PRACTITIONERS IT'S NOT ENTRY LEVEL IT'S GOING TO BE A RIGOROUS. THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON- ON PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD LIKE TO PLAN AND LEAD PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECTS. INCLUDING FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL. BURN BOSSES WHO HAVE RETIRED BUT STILL WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS WORK AND BE PART OF THE SOLUTION- COMMUNITY AND TRIBAL LEADERS LIKE ME AND BILL AND MARGOT AND PROBABLY OTHERS. INVOLVED IN THIS PANEL- WHO WISH TO BUILD LOCAL CAPACITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND PRIVATE CONTRACTORS FOR HIM THIS COULD BE A NEW NICHE. AS WELL AS JUST PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WHO WANT TO FURTHER THEIR OWN PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECTS ON THEIR LAND. NOW I REALLY WORRY THAT THIS PROGRAM THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING IN THAT WE'RE ROLLING OUT. DOES NOT CONFER ENOUGH BENEFIT TO THE STATE CERTIFIED BURN BOSSES- TO INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION OR TO EXPAND PRESCRIBED FIRE EFFORTS. ON A MEANINGFUL SCALE- PER SB TWELVE SIXTY BURN BOSSES WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHARE LIABILITY WITH CAL FIRE THROUGH THE PERMIT PROCESS. I'M HOWEVER THEY WILL NOT ENJOY A DIFFERENT LIABILITY STANDARD LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER STATES. AND THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO GET INSURANCE FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING I SEE THIS AS A HUGE PROBLEM. PRESCRIBED FIRE INSURANCE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO SECURE- BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. AND IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY A PROBLEM FOR PRIVATE BURN BOSSES AS WELL AS FOR ORGANIZATIONS AND CONTRACTORS WHO ARE LOOKING TO LEAVE THIS KIND OF WORK. SO I SEE THESE TWO POINTS THE LIABILITY PIECE IN THE INSURANCE PIECE AS TOP PRIORITIES FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE. IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IF WE WANTTO SUPPORT EXPAND PRESCRIBED FIRE IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO ACTIVELY PURSUE A GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD FOR STATE CERTIFIED BURN BOSSES- SOMETHING THAT COULD. TIE RIGHT INTO THE PROGRAM THAT E'RE ROLLING OUT. AND WE SHOULD ALSO DEVELOP A CALIFORNIA PRESCRIBED FIRE INSURANCE CLAIM FUND- THIS COULD BE MODELED AFTER THE FUN THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE UTILITIES- WHERE YOU KNOW. WHERE THERE'S- I FIND THAT COVER EXCEPT LOS. FOR A PRESCRIBED FIRE OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT REALLY INCENTIVIZE IS THE PRIVATE INSURERS TO PROVIDE OPTIONS POLICY OPTIONS FOR. PRIVATE BURN BOSSES AND FOR ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS KIND OF WORK. SO THOSE THOSE TWO PIECES I THINK ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. THEY'RE ALSO REGULATORY BARRIERS TO THE EXPANDED USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE AND FOR STATE LETTER STATE FUNDED PROJECTS THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT C. QUOTE. I'M CAN RESULT IN REALLY COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING PLANNING PROCESS. THAT CAN CREATE DELAYS AND PLANNING COST CAN OFTEN EXCEED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS SO. I BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE INTEGRAL AND NATURAL ROLE OF FIRE ON CALIFORNIA'S LANDSCAPES WE REALLY SHOULD BE PURSUING SOME KIND OF EXEMPTION FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE- THAT WOULD BETTER STREAMLINE AND MAKE AND SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR TREATING THESE PROJECTS DONE. AND LASTLY I'D LIKE TO MENTION AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS IT WAS GREAT O HEAR THE LAST PRESENTER REALLY GET THAT AIR QUALITY PERSPECTIVE ON PRESCRIBED FIRE- YOU KNOW ASIDE FROM KIND OF THE ATTAINMENT PERSPECTIVE I THINK THERE ARE SOME REAL ADMINISTRATIVE HURDLES TO PRESCRIBED FIRE IN CALIFORNIA AROUND THE AIR QUALITY PIECE. ONE PROBLEM IS THE COST OF AIR QUALITY PERMITS. IN THE NORTH COAST UNIFIED AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WHERE I WORK A THREE HUNDRED ACRE PRESCRIBED BURN WOULD COST TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A PERMIT. PLUS SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A SMOKE MANAGEMENT PLAN- THOSE COSTS ARE YOU KNOW A DEAL BREAKER FOR MOST FOLKS ARE TRYING TO DO THIS PUBLIC BENEFIT WORK. MEANWHILE AIR QUALITY PERMITS IN OUR NEIGHBORING SISKIYOU COUNTY ARE FREE. SO THE COSTA REALLY INEQUITABLE ACROSS THE STREET ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE AIR DISTRICTS MAY REPRESENT A MAJOR BURDEN FOR LANDOWNERS AND FOR AGENCIES ALIKE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THIS GOOD WORK- I REALLY THINK THAT. YOU KNOW PUBLIC BENEFIT WORK LIKE THIS SHOULD NOT COST US A BUNCH OF MONEY. I AM IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT SOME ERROR DISTRICTS ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND OVERWHELMED WITH THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S COMING OUT THEM FROM THE PRESCRIBED FIRE SIDE. AND THEY'RE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE PERMITTING AND THE SMOKE MANAGEMENT PLANNING PROCESS IN A TIMELY FASHION. PERMIT RENEWAL AND SOME A COMMENCEMENT IN SOME. TAKE WEEKS MONTHS AND REALLY DELAY OUR WORK AND FORCE US TO MISS IMPORTANT WINDOWS. SO I SEE THESE ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES ON THE AIR QUALITY SITE IS PRETTY LOW HANGING FRUIT. AND SOMETHING WE COULD WE COULD ADDRESS AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO I GUESS IN CLOSING I JUST REALLY LIKE TO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND I REALLY HOPE WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS IMPORTANT TIME THAT WE'RE AND- WE HAVE SOCIAL LICENSE WE HAVE MOMENTUM. WE HAVE COMMUNITY EXCITEMENT AROUND PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND WE REALLY NEED TO HARNESS THAT ENERGY AND DO SOME GOOD THINGS TO ENABLE MORE WORK. AND I'D REALLY LIKE US TO KEEP A FOCUS ON THE TRIBAL PEACE AND ON THE COMMUNITY PEACE AND- YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE REAL STEWARDS OF THE LAND LET'S EMPOWER THEM TO HAVE AN ACTIVE ROLE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON NOW TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE- YOU ACTUALLY- ANSWERED MOST OF MY QUESTIONS YOU. YOUR PRESENTATION WAS VERY VERY THOROUGH BUT I WILL ASK YOU IN THIS IS- TO MRS QUINN DAVIS AND- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BIGGEST BARRIER. IF I CAN GIVE YOU WHAT IF YOU CAN JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK THE BIGGEST BARRIER IS TO INTRODUCING MORE- PRESCRIBE BURNS IN CALIFORNIA YOU MENTIONED A BUNCH OF BARRIERS BUT WHAT IF YOU WERE GONNA SAY YOUR TOP THREE. LIST WILL APPOINT A LOT LIKE THE P. I MIGHT THREE. WELL DO THINK THOSE FIRST TWO IN A REALLY REALLY IN A REAL WAY I DO THINK THAT LIABILITY PIECE AND THOSE INSURANCE PIECES ARE OUR- TOP TWO FOR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS FAR AS GETTING MORE WORK DONE. AND THEN WHAT I ALWAYS SAY IS I REALLY DO THINK THAT ONE OF THE TOP AREAS WERE DEALING WITH IN THE WEST AND NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA. IS CULTURAL AND IT'S AROUND THIS OWNERSHIP ISSUE AND- AND KIND OF MAKING ROOM FOR- NON FIRE PROFESSIONALS HAVE A ROLE IN IN PRESCRIBED FIRE AND- TO REALLY RECONNECT PEOPLE WITH THEIR LANDSCAPE THROUGH THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE SO. I THINK WE NEED TO QUESTION OUR OUR CULTURAL NORMS AROUND. HOW WE THINK OF. PRESCRIBED FIRE AND WHO GETS TO BE INVOLVED IN WHO GETS TO LEAD. SO WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO. TRY TO INCORPORATE MORE. YOU KNOW ORDINARY LANDOWNERS LET'S SAY- JUST LANDOWNERS INTO THE PROCESS. WOULD YOU THEN- ENVY HOW WOULD YOU HOW WOULD YOU ENVISION DOING THAT SAFELY. WOULD YOU HAVE TO CERTIFY THEM SOMEHOW OR TRY USING. THEM SORRY NO GO AHEAD GO AHEAD. IT'S YEAH IT'S- YOU KNOW I WORK IN. LOOKS AND SO BIG OF MY- IS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND TRAINING. AND I DO SEE TRAINING AS A BIG PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE AND IF WE HAVE FUNDING TO DIRECT TOWARDS MORE TRAINING I THINK THAT'S GREAT WE SAW THAT IN THE WIDE IN BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED FEDERALLY- PRESCRIBED FIRE TRAINING EXCHANGES. WE HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE TRAINING FOR AVERAGE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT MAKING SPACE FOR THEM AND PROVIDING FUNDING. TWELVE SIXTY- I THINK YOU WOULD REFER TO THAT BILL IN YOUR PRESENTATION I WILL HOW WOULD YOU HOW WOULD YOU GET OLD ON THAT WHAT WOULD YOU DO NOW TO KIND OF. CONTINUE TO WORK IN THAT BILL IF YOU WERE GOING TO INTRODUCE SOMETHING TO- LET'S SAY MAKE IT EVE EASIER TO PRESCRIBE FIRE LEGISLATIVELY BESIDES THE FUNDING PIECE IN THE TRAINING PIECE. THE FUNDING HE'S IN THE TRAINING. YEAH WELL NOT TO SOUND LIKE A BROKEN BUT I DO THINK THAT THE NEGLIGENCE PIECE AND THE INSURANCE PIECE ARE THE NATURAL FOLLOW UP TO SB TWELVE SIXTY. SB TWELVE SIXTY CREATED THE STATE CERTIFIED BURN BOSS PROGRAM WHICH IS HUGELY IMPORTANT AND MONUMENTAL REALLY FOR CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S MISSING THOSE KEY PIECES AND I DO WORRY IT'LL FALL FLAT WITHOUT THOSE THOSE FOLLOW UP- SUPPORTIVE PIECES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M I'M SURE OTHER PANEL OTHER MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT I'M GOING I'M TURN TO DOCTOR STEVENS FOR A MOMENT FOR QUITE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. DOCTOR STEVENS IF YOU'RE THERE- I CAN HEAR YOU. GOT THINK. I'M I'M JUST GOING TO VERY QUICKLY IF YOU CAN THE TELL US ABOUT THE FLORIDA LIABILITY PROGRAM AND JUST IN A NUTSHELL. I HOW THAT'S WORKING AND HOW YOU WOULD NOT MAKE THAT WORK IN CALIFORNIA. NO I WOULD AGREE WITH US ON LINKEDIN ABOUT HOW THIS IS BEING SO CRITICAL IN. FLORIDA THEIR NEGLIGENCE LONGER A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN OURS AND UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I CAN'T SPEAK EXACTLY WHAT THIS IDEA OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE IN FLORIDA. IS IT IS THE THRESHOLD THAT MEANS IF YOU ACTUALLY. DO YOUR PRESCRIBED FIRE YOU CONDUCTED TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE IS CORRECT AS BEST AS POSSIBLE. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. THEN THE STATE ACTUALLY STEPS IN AND THEY BASICALLY WILL COVER LIABILITY WITH SOME PRIVATE INSURANCE. AS WELL FROM THE PRESCRIBERS. FIRELIGHT POINTED TO TWO. EIGHT IT WAS. ON STATE OF FLORIDA LAND THAT ACTUALLY WAS DONE BY A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR THE CONTRACTOR HAD INSURANCE. THAT WAS PART OF THE USE OF THE- TRYING TO GET THOSE PEOPLE HOLD A THIRTY SIX PEOPLE. IT TURNED OUT THAT THE HOUSES WERE BURNED IN A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY. AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE ANOTHER INTERESTING OR SAD ISSUE BECAUSE THAT COMMUNITY HADN'T HAD AS MUCH. INVESTMENT IN TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE FIRE WIDER FIRE SAFETY WAS MORE VULNERABLE SURE THERE'S AN EQUITY ISSUE THERE. SO I WOULD SAY THAT. YEAH IDEA OF TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF INSTITUTIONAL ABILITY. FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE RELEASED THE BACKING OF THE STATE AS LONG AS THEY DO THEIR WORK AS THEY SAY. THEY DON'TDO SOMETHING FOOLISH. OKAY LET ME ASK YOU I LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE SOME FOR SOME FOREST BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT FARCE THAN WHAT WE NORMALLY THINK OF PRESCRIBED FIRES. HOW WOULD THIS WORK OR WOULDN'T WORK AND CHAPARRAL AREAS AND IN AREAS THAT ARE GRASSLAND AREAS- OR IN SOME OF OUR URBAN- WILDLIFE AREAS LET'S SAY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. IS THIS STILL IS SOMETHING. WE SHOULD BE PURSUING OR HER HOW WOULD LOOK DIFFERENT. NO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BECAUSE YOU'RE UP TO. RIGHT CHAPARRAL REALLY IS IT A DAY. PLACE IT IS THAT MORE TO. BECAUSE IT'S A SYSTEM THAT BURKE WITH HIGH SEVERITY HIGH POINTS EVERY FEW DECADES OR SOMETIMES EVEN EVERY TEN YEARS. I THINK HERE YOU GET. YEP BE MORE STRATEGIC. YOU KNOW L. A. COUNTY FIRE OTHERS VENTURA COUNTY FIRE DONE SOME REALLY GOOD WORK OF KIND OF. WONDERING WHERE IT IN THIS LANDSCAPE OF PEOPLE AND VEGETATION AND CHAPARRAL- WE DO SOME WORK TO. REALLY SET SOMETHING UP TO ONE OF FIRE DOES HAPPEN WE CAN USE THAT AS AN ANCHOR USE THAT AS A WAY TO MAYBE KEEP PEOPLE SAFER. SO I WOULD JUST SAY IN THE CHAPARRAL AREA YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK REALLY STRATEGICALLY WORKING WITH SUPPRESSION FOLKS. AND THEN THREE CONDITIONS SOME AREAS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY THINK YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THAT LANDSCAPE. AND IT'S STILL SOME OF THE DOES PERTAIN TO THAT. BUT IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT MORE NUANCED A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING. SO YOU CAN STILL DO THE PRESCRIBED BURNS IN THOSE AREAS YOU JUST HAVE TO. ALTER HOW YOU DO THEM. YOU CAN'T I'VE GOT A- 35% FIRES SHOPPERS MICHAEL ONE THING THAT TAX. I'M BEEN A FAN AND YOU CAN DO THESE AND WHEN. YOU CAN DO THE LITERALLY WHENEVER ELSE ON. BURNED GRASS IS STILL GREEN YOUR BASE. GOT HIGH BUDGETARY. OF COURSE A LOT OF PLACES THOUGHT TO CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW OUR- TO FREQUENTLY. SANTA MONICA. AND OTHER AREAS WHERE WE SEEN STRESSED IMPOSED BY WILDFIRE BURNING TO FREQUENTLY. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A- COMPLIMENT TO TRY TO. FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS IS WITH. ONE OF IMPORTANCE. TO ALLOW SUPPRESSION TO ACTUALLY WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY KEEP PEOPLE AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU IN AUGUST WE SAW SOME PRETTY INTENSE LIGHTNING STORMS AND I'M WONDERING IF THOSE ARE GOING TO. KIND OF CONTINUE. IN SORT OF THIS IS THE SORT OF ABNORMAL WAY AND WHETHER THAT CHANGES ANY OF THIS EQUATION. OR AND HOW WE PRIORITIZE. THE BURNS. KNOW YOUR ACTUAL RIGHT HERE WE HAD REALLY AND I AND- LA. STORM IN AUGUST THIS YEAR IT WAS UP. SYSTEM OF KIND OF UP SUBTROPICAL SYSTEM IN THE EQUATOR IT CAME UP TO COME TO CAL. PASSED ALONG BY LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE BULLS I WAS THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD LIGHTNING- BUST IN CALIFORNIA. THE LAST THING WE JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE ONE BEFORE THAT WAS IN THE LATE SUMMER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. WE SEEM TO GET THEM AT LEAST HAS BEEN LAST HISTORY EVERY TEN TO FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS OR SO. AND THIS ONE WAS ONE OF THOSE. ONE OF THE GRANDEST. I THINK. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RESEARCH ON LIGHTNING WE EXPECT LIGHTNING INCIDENTS INCREASE JUST BECAUSE OF MORE ENERGY IN THE ATMOSPHERE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. SO WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE MORE LIGHTNING JUST IN GENERAL. BUT I JUST I DON'T THINK WE HAVE REALLY WE CAN'T SAY THAT WE EXPECT TO HAVE MORE OF THESE KIND OF STORMS THAT CAME ANAHIT POSTAL CALIFORNIA SO SEVERELY. ONE THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT STORM IT IT SHOWED YOU THE VULNERABILITY EVER LANDSCAPES SANTA CRUZ COUNTY CONTRA COSTA COUNTY LAKE COUNTY NAPA COUNTY. SIERRA NEVADA IT IS SHOWS JUST HOW BIG WOULD IF THIS ISSUE IS JUST LIKE WHAT WORKS NEED JACK SAID THAT. IT REALLY IS A LANDSCAPE GLOBAL PROBLEM THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE WILL SEE MORE LIGHTNING BUT WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO SEE AS MANY. YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA GET A BUNCH OF. BIG LIGHTNING BUS LIKE THE ONE WE HAD AUGUST WE'RE GONNA GET HIM AGAIN BUT HOPE PLACE FIFTEEN YEARS. THANK YOU AND I'M GONNA TURN TO DR PRETTY KEY. IF WE. CAN GET HER BACK ON THE LINE. AND HERE OKAY GREAT. SO I JUST COUPLE. FOR YOU. YOU DID A GREAT JOB OF. THE WILDFIRE. POLLUTION THE PRESCRIBED BURN. I'M WONDERING HOW THAT FIGURES COMPARED TO JUST OTHER SOURCES OF POLLUTION- ARE THEY DWARFED. IS THE WILDFIRE. POLLUTION THAT WE SAW FOR INSTANCE IS A DWARF THE- YOU SHOULD NOT RECEIVE FROM HIGHWAYS AND OTHER TYPES OF POLLUTION- KIND OF HOW. HOW DO WE JUDGE THE PRESCRIBED BURN POLLUTION AGAINST OTHER. SOURCES OF POLLUTION IN THE ACT AND THE ENVIRONMENT. RIGHT SO TYPICALLY WITH ESPECIALLY THE WILD CARDS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING READ. DEBT LEVEL POLLUTION MUCH HIGHER OBVIOUSLY THAN THE PRESCRIBED BURN AND EVEN YOU KNOW SEE. THE LARGER LITERATURE THAT WE HAVE ON ON ON AIR POLLUTION YOU KNOW FROM TRAFFIC AND OTHER SOURCES OF POLLUTION SO WHICH FAR EXCEEDS THAT AND TO THE POINT THAT- WE'RE ACTIVELY DOING RESEARCH IN THAT AREA TO FIND OUT. WITH THESE VERY LARGE INCREASES AND PM TWO POINT FIVE FOR THE LONGER DURATION CHILD THAT DOES IMPACT HEALTH. WHAT ABOUT THE PRESCRIBED. SARS WAS IT WHAT ABOUT THE PRESCRIBED BURN FIRE I ASSUME WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA A LITTLE BIT MORE YEARS OF DOING THAT HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE- I MEAN I WITH THE- THAT WE SAW ON LOS ANGELES IN THE BAY AREA AND SACRAMENTO. IT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT I'VE SEEN CERTAINLY FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME- BUT WE'RE TYPICAL PRESCRIBER AND I WAS SOON WOULDN'T HAVE THAT LEVEL. OF INTENSITY SO HOW DOES THAT- POLLUTION COMPARED TO JUST YOUR RUN OF THE MILL POLLUTION. RIGHT SO THAT THAT THAT THE POLLUTION LEVELS ARE MUCH LOWER- AND CHART MY UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE STATE- D. CONDUCTED YOU KNOW THEY LET IT BURN SLOWER AND THEY LET FEET POLLUTION DISSIPATE UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE SO YOU DON'T GET THAT BIG BUILD UP. ALL YOU KNOW CLIMATE POLLUTION AND THEN BASS IMPACTING THE SURROUNDING POPULATION- SO THE B. IT MAKES SENSE THAT THEY'RE SEVERE HEALTH IMPACTS FOR PRESCRIBED BURNS BECAUSE- SIMPLY BE. THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION IS SO MUCH LAST- WHAT THE LEVEL OF PM TWO POINT FIVE IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SOURCES. THANKS IN GIVEN THAT DO YOU THINK THAT OUR AIR REGULATORS SHOULD BE CHANGING OR RE EVALUATING. HOW THEY'RE REGULATING PRESCRIBED FIRES IN MY OPINION YES- BECAUSE- THERE'S SO MANY ADVANTAGES. TO HAVING THE PRESCRIBED BURNS- ESPECIALLY WARMER CONSIDERING OUR HEALTH- AND BE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THAT AND YOU KNOW IF NEED THE MOST POPULATIONS OUT OF THE AREA THAT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO AVOID SMOKE EXPOSURE- BUT THE PLANNING ABILITY THE PRESCRIBED BURN. OUT TO AVOID HEALTH IMPACTS SEEMS TO BE- SUCH A HUGE FACTOR. MAKING IT MUCH MORE DESIRABLE MUCH LESS DETRIMENTAL TO OUR OVERALL HEALTH. MY LAST QUESTION I'LL ASK IT TO WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER THAT GIVEN THERE'S A FEDERAL WILDFIRE PREVENTION BILL OR IF THERE IS ONE NEXT YEAR WHAT SHOULD CALIFORNIA ASKED TO BE IN IT THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH A FEDERAL BILL. YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER THAT'S OKAY BUT IF ANYONE IS COSTS. THIS IS GOT MAYBE ALL THIS BILL A MOMENT KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT ON THE WILD URBAN. AS EIGHT SEPARATE POINT I THINK THAT'S GREAT. SOME BILLS KIND OF FOCUSED MORE JUST ON THAT WHILE OF LIFE ITSELF OTHERS MAY BE ON THE WILD LAND I THINK THE ONE THING WE REALLY NEED IS WE NEED BOTH SIDES OF THAT COIN. WE CAN WORK ON THE WILD LANDS WE CAN DO SOME RESTORATION THERE WOULD BE PRESCRIBED BURNING THAT CAN REDUCE THE INTENSITY OF FIRE THE SPAWNING POTENTIAL WILDFIRE AND WE CAN ALSO WORK ON THE ONE HUNDRED INTERFACE THAT'S CRUCIAL. GET OUR HUMAN COMMUNITIES BETTER PREPARE FOR FIRE THAT IS CRUCIAL SO I WOULD JUST SAY THE FEINSTEIN BILL DOES THAT THE FEINSTEIN BILL WORKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT LINE THE WHILE INSIDE. AND ALSO ON THE ON THE PRIVATE SIDE SO I WOULD. ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF EFFORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M I HAVE NO OTHER FOR THIS PANEL THAT'S AND DOCTOR WOULD. GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAESAR REALLY REALLY INTERESTING AND AN IMPORTANT PRESENTATION SO I WANNA SAY I APPRECIATE THEM I WANT TO GO FIRST TO- DOCTOR PER NICKI A QUICK HOPE I SAID THAT RIGHT. IF NOT I APOLOGIZE- YOUR- OKAY THAT'S WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START THAT. YOUR YOUR IN YOUR SUMMARY SLIDE WHICH I'M LOOKING AT NOW YOU YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW YOUR STUDIES OF THAT ART THE SHOW THEIR EXPOSURE WILDFIRES MORE DETRIMENTAL TO HEALTH- THAN A PRESCRIBED BURN IN CHILDREN- NOW. I ASSUME ALL RIGHT MAYBE I SHOULD I ACTUALLY I'M AWARE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER STUDIES THAT ARE LOOKING AT A PM TWO POINT FIVE RELEASES. IN THE IN OTHER AREAS THAT- AND HOW THAT MIGHT AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE LIKE LIKE OLDER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE- ALREADY COMPROMISED- RESPIRATORY SYSTEMS- IS THAT WHAT WORK LIKELY ARE YOU AWARE THAT WORK IS OUT LIKELY TO SHOW. ANYTHING SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN CHILDREN I AM CURIOUS BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF A LOT OF OLDER PEOPLE WHO WHO MAY HAVE REST PROBLEMS AND THEN BEING EXPOSED TO THE KIND OF SMOKE THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO- THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AGO. I KNOW IT'S EVEN FOR HEALTHY PEOPLE THAT'S NOT NOT A GOOD THING. RATES ARE YOU SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY- MCCARTY PRESCRIBED BURNS I MEAN I CAN TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT- INJECT WITH SMOKE EXPOSURE MORE MORE THE- OLDER POPULATION MORE SMOKE EXPOSURE BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY YOU'VE ALREADY YOU'VE ALREADY TOLD US. THAT THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE AND A PRESCRIBED BURN VERSUS A REGULAR WILDFIRE IS LESS SO. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WORK AND CONTROLLED OR THE OR THE WILDFIRE IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT. RIGHT YEAH I CERTAINLY DO SO- SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT- THE RESPIRATORY IMPACTS- CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FOUR BUT THEN THOSE ALSO AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER OR MORE RISK- WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO WILDFIRE SMOKE TO BE SEEN IN HOSPITAL FOR RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS- IN ADDITION THOSE WHO HAVE CHRONIC. WHO ALREADY HAVE PRE EXISTING YOU KNOW RESPIRATORY ISSUES WILL BE MORE AT RISK. D. OUR LITERATURE IS ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IMPACT- FROM EXPOSURE WILDFIRE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE. QUITE SHOCKING- THOSE AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER OR DECREASED RISK FOR HEART ATTACKS FOR A READY MEALS. FOR STROKES IN ADDITION THERE IS A PAPER THAT CAME OUT LAST YEAR THAT SHOWED THAT EVEN GOING DOWN AT AGE THIRTY FIVE AND UP. WHEN THEY WHEN A COMMUNITY IS EXPOSED TO WILDFIRE SMOKE THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK FOR SIDE AND- CARDIAC ARREST- WHICH IS FOR SOMEONE JUST. I'M BASICALLY OF THE HEART STOPPED AND THEY COLLAPSED AND THEY TYPICALLY DON'T EVEN MAKE IT TO THE HOSPITAL- AND SO PRIOR TO- TO THE STUDY THOSE TYPES OF- SEVEN CARDIAC ARREST DEATH. YOU KNOW HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR SO. B. B. THE ARE CERTAIN MUCH MORE AT RISK- STUDIES HAVE CLEARLY SHOWN THAT AND THEN THOSE WITH THE PRE EXISTING YOU KNOW RESPIRATORY CARDIAC CONDITIONS THERE'S ALSO STUDIES COMING OUT SHOWING THAT- DOES WITHIN STAGE- RENAL DISEASE- HAVE INCREASED DEATH RATES OF WILDFIRE SMOKE THEIR STUDIES. SHOWING THAT- PREGNANT WOMEN ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR BIRTH OUTCOMES- SHOW- THERE SEVERAL YOU KNOW DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AVAILABLE POPULATIONS THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW MITIGATING WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE. SO IS IT SAFE TO SAY THAT- WILDFIRE SMOKE UNCONTROLLED WILDFIRES POSE A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH RISK TO CERTAIN POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE FAIR ENOUGH. A FAIR ENOUGH AND I'M PROBABLY GENERAL POPULATION ALSO. MORE ONGOING RESEARCH YES GREAT CERTAINLY- STUDIES HAVE SUPPORTED THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GONNA GO TO LET LANIER. SHE'S IF SHE'S STILL THERE. HI LONG TIME NO SEE YEP I'M STILL HERE GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU WE- IN ALL FAIRNESS WE WERE TOGETHER A WEEK OR SO AGO I GUESS- I'VE BEEN- COUNTY. AND YOU KNOW I. I HEARD YOU KNOW AND THEN WHAT WHAT I HEARD FROM YOU TODAY ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE FOR EXAMPLE. ALL THE MANAGEMENT DISTRICTS ARE VERY INCONSISTENT IN HOW THEY CHARGE FEES. SO THEY CAN HANDLE COUNTY PARTICULAR WE WERE LOOKING AT A SITE THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED ACRES AS I AROUND A HUNDRED ACRES- IN OTHER AREAS IT'S NOTHING. YEAH THREE HUNDRED OKAY THREE ARTICLES BUT IN OTHER AREAS THAT FIREWOOD THAT THAT PERMIT WOULD COST NOTHING- AND THAT. I KIND OF THAT INCONSISTENCY FINE- DISTURBING. AND FRUSTRATING FOR ME AS WELL- AND ALSO TO BE A DETERRENT. I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM OTHERS THAT THE SECRET DOCUMENTS AND I'M TO ANOTHER FIRE PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. HAVING IN SO NOW MAKING. THE SIX BIKE USE THE C. WERE DOCKING AND I'M GONNA PUT ON I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER C. WHAT. HOWEVER THE DOCTOR. AND THE STATE DOCUMENTS FOR A BENEFITS. LANDSCAPE TREATMENT VISUAL WHICH WE ALL AGREE IS BENEFICIAL. SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE COST. OF THE ACTUAL WORK AND THAT IS HAPPENING PRETTY CONSISTENTLY AS I FAIR. YOU CAN. YEAH I THINK SO MMHM AND THAT'S AND THAT THAT CONCERNS ME AND THEN THERE YOU ARE AND BECAUSE OF THAT YOU ARE WHAT YOU HAVE A YOU ONLY HAVE LIMITED WINDOWS WHICH YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS WORK. AND THE DELAYS ON SEQUEL- AND SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS CLOSE THOSE WINDOWS FAIRLY QUICKLY. CLOSE THOSE WINDOWS PRETTY QUICKLY THAT FAIR. YEAH THAT'S TRUE. SO GUY AND WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE LIABILITY AND- THE- GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARDS AND I THINK THOSE ARE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT IMPORTANT ISSUES AS WELL SO I JUST WANNA THANK YOU I. I KINDA RESTATING WHAT YOU SAID BUT I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE WERE BOTH ON THE SAME PAGE I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND AS- YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HURT MY EARLY COMMENTS I'M GOING I'M GOING UP TO HAPPY CAMP. AND VISITING WITH KARUK ON FRIDAY. IN THE RAIN TO SEE WHAT. TO SEE ONCE AGAIN WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND- AND WHAT THEY HAVE PLANNED AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. HOW YOU BEEN A PIONEER IN HELPING GETTING. MORE AWARENESS ABOUT PRESCRIBED FIRE AND I. HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR VISIT LAST WEEK AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING MORE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM ONE OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHOSE WITH THIS REMOTELY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA. SO SOMEBODY CAN OF. I THINK MAYBE SEE ME NOW. WE SEE YOU MAKE MUCH SENSE THANK YOU MY QUESTIONS FOR DOCTOR NEKI- ME I THINK FUNDED DATA YOU PRESENTED TO US IT'S CLEAR THAT WILDFIRE- HAS MANY MORE HEALTH WITH FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND PRESCRIBED FIRES BUT WE STILL HAVE JUST TO BE CLEAR THEY'RE STILL REAL HEALTH CONCERNS ALSO ARE HELD WITH WITH PRESCRIBED FIRES IS THAT CORRECT. WILD I THINK THE PRIMARY RISK COULD BE TO THE B. FIREFIGHTERS DOING THAT PRESCRIBED BURNING. BUT IF THERE IS A POPULATION THAT COULD BE IMPACTED- CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE GONNA INHALE SMOKE THERE IS THERE IS A RISK BUT THE- WITH THE PRESCRIBER AND YOU'RE ABLE TO. DUPLICATION IF NECESSARY MASS AIR PURIFIERS YOU KNOW NOT BEING IN THE AREA WARNING PEOPLE STEALING UP YOUR HOUSE WHATEVER IT MAY BE-BUT IF YOU KNOW ANY TYPE OF SMOKE SHOULD NOT. BE AN HELD A POSSIBLE. SO WHAT WHAT I MEAN I MEAN BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD BE DOING MORE PRESCRIBED FIRES I DON'T WANT TO COME OFF AS ANTAGONISTIC. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE B. ARENE EQUITABLE AND PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AS WE'RE DOING THIS IN OUR THINKING ALL ABOARD ON THAT- WHAT KIND OF MEDICATIONS TO GO ON NOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THESE FILTERS ARE BEING MOVED OUT. WHEN WE DO DO THESE PRESCRIBED FIRES. I DON'T THINK I'M A GOOD ONE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE WHEN PRESCRIBED FIRES OCCUR. BUT YOU KNOW FROM THE HEALTH LITERATURE WE- WE DO HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT CAN BE. YOU KNOW DONE THAT TO MEDICATE ANY CONCERNS- BUT CERTAINLY WE DO NOW THAT YOU KNOW- EXPOSURE TO WILDFIRE SMOKE IS TYPICALLY IN A MUCH GREATER MUCH MORE DETRIMENTAL- TO THE PRESCRIBED BURNING. MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO ANSWER- BUT THE CURRENT PRACTICES. WHEN A PRESCRIBED BURN IT'S GOING TO OCCUR. ANYONE. I'M NOT HEARING ANY YEAH I CAN I CAN SPEAK TO THAT BRIEFLY I THINK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO GO THROUGH PRETTY RIGOROUS SMOKE MANAGEMENT PLANNING PROCESS SEES WHEN WE PLANNED PRESCRIBED FIRES SO- WE REALLY TRY TO TARGET WINDOWS WHEN WE GET GOOD DISPERSION ARE SMOKELESS AND IS CARRIED AWAY AND NOT SETTLING DOWN ON COMMUNITIES- SO THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FOR THOUGHT THAT GOES INTO THAT AND WE REALLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW THE RIGHT CONDITIONS AND THE RIGHT WEATHER WINDOWS AND THE RIGHT WIND DIRECTIONS AND THERE ARE SO MANY PIECES THAT WE CONSIDER SO. WE REALLY JUST TRY TO AVOID THOSE KINDS OF IMPACTS FROM THE START- THAT SAID WE DO HAVE TIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE NEED TO BURN AND IMPACTS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHEN DEPENDING ON WHO'S DOING THE BURN AND WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE FILTERS OR DO THINGS LIKE THAT NOT REALLY IS GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT THE ENTITY IS WHO'S DOING IT WHAT COMMUNITY THERE AND WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES THEY PROVIDE SO THAT'S A BIT MORE VARIABLE BUT THAT SMOKE MANAGEMENT PLANNING PIECES IS- NOT IS VERY ABLE TO PROCESS THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH AND PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO. STEPHEN I JUST THAT THE YOU KNOW CREEK THOMAS AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SN JOAQUIN AREA SAN JOAQUIN IS THAT SOME OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AIR QUALITY BUT CREGGAN OTHERS OF WORK AND DEVELOP THE NETWORK NOW SO WHEN THEY WANT TO BURN IN THE SOUTHERN SIERRA THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY CLINICS ARE ACTUALLY TOLD ABOUT THIS THEY CAN THEN ADVISE THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE PERHAPS PART OF THE PULMONARY AND OTHER ISSUES. THIS IS COMING SO THEY'VE REALLY BUILT THIS COOPERATION BETWEEN A PLACE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AREA WITH SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE COOPERATION AND IT IS REAL LIKE YOU SAY THAT YOU CAN IMPACT PEOPLE BUT I SEE THIS AREA IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT'S GIVEN US GREAT HOPE BECAUSE SOME. GROUPS ARE REALLY. WORKING TOGETHER TRYING TO LOOK LONG TERM. THANK YOU FOR THAT DO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF. TRY IN OUR SO IF YOU SEE KIND OF A DIFFERENT ARE DOING THAT MANY AND THEIR PLANS AND HOW MAY BE SOME COMMUNITIES MIGHT HAVE BETTER. I MIGHT BE DOING THINGS BETTER THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES I'VE I'VE BEEN. NEAR PRESCRIBED FIRES WHEN IT'S HAPPENING YOU KNOW LET THEM TIME TO KIND OF MAKE OTHERS YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MAP AND THERE'S A PRESCRIBED FIRE AND I COULD FEEL IT- YOU KNOW AND I DIDN'T GET THE INFORMATION AND SO THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLIC INFORMATION OUT THERE. DO WE HAVE SOME SORT OF PROPERLY KINDA LEARN FROM EACH OTHER FOR BETTER PRACTICES FOR THOSE POLITICAL COMMUNITIES. THIS IS SCOTT STEVENS AGAIN I THINK. THE REALLY IS WORKING MORE AND LIKE YOU SAID AT A LOCAL COMMUNITY LEVEL MAYBE THERE COULD BE A WAY TO. HELP FOSTER THAT BUT YOU KNOW. DRUG COMMUNICATIONS TO CLINICS THAT BASICALLY SERVES. PEOPLE LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND OTHERS THAT. MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THIS WORK IS HAPPENING BECAUSE ONE. WHEN THIS IS HAPPENING THE SAN JOAQUIN I THINK THE AIR QUALITY DISTRICT DOWN THERE IS NOW A GREAT PARTNER. AND A LOOK AT THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT ACTUALLY COOPERATE WITH SO. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT PROBABLY IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE AD HOC I WOULD IMAGINE SO I DON'T KNOW THAT SYSTEMIC I'M I'M MAYBE OTHERS ON THE PANEL COULD SAY. SHE. I NOW HAVE. LAST QUITE. THERE'S A LOT OF DATA ABOUT. THAT WAS PRESENTED TO US ON PM TWO POINT FIVE FOR THE DISCUSSION AND THERE'S A FEW OTHER THINGS ON SOME OF THESE FLAGS. THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. ARE WE TRACKING OR DO WE HAVE STUDIES ON GHG EMISSIONS- I MEAN I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT MY CATASTROPHIC MUCH APPRECIATE SHE IS BEING ADMITTED. THAT IT MIGHT PRESCRIBE OUR BUT- AS WE'RE WORKING ON OUR- REDUCTION OF GHGS REDDIT. FOR ME IT'S MORE LIKE. KNOWING WHAT'S THERE SO I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO MITIGATE LATE LATER- YOU KNOW AS WE AS WE EMBRACE THIS PRACTICE ART DO WE HAVE ANY OF THAT THAT'S CURRENTLY GOING ON AT THE STATE LEVEL. I MIGHT AND I MIGHT JUST ADD. SOMETHING IN HERE. AS PART OF. WHAT I BELIEVE WAS SB NINE A ONE. WE'VE ASKED THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO ACTUALLY MEASURE- WILDFIRE EMISSIONS. AND THE GHGS ASSOCIATE WITH THAT SO I AM ANXIOUSLY AWAITING TO SEE pCOMPARES TO OTHER OTHER KINDS OF POLLUTION. OUT THERE- BUT- I WOULD I WOULD GUESS THAT THESE ARE HUGE EMISSIONS I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY FALL ON THE SCALE OF. WHAT ELSE IS OMITTED FROM CARS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT- HAVING BREATHED A LOT OF THIS FIRM FOR OVER. MONTHS AND YEARS NOW- AND SEEING THE EFFECTS OF MY COMMUNITY. IT'S NOT POSITIVE AND SO. BUT I DO KNOW WE HAVE ASKED. FOR MEASUREMENTS ON THAT AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE GET THAT DATA SOON. AND WHAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE IS A COMPARISON SIDE BY SIDE LIKE WHAT YOU'RE- ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO STATIONARY POLLUTION HOUSES COMPARED TO. TAILPIPE POLLUTION. AND HOW DOES YOU KNOW AND HOW DOES THIS ALL STACK UP BECAUSE- I JUST FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT INVESTING THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO HELP PREVENT THESE WILD. WILD LARGE WILDFIRES. AND MY HOPE IS THAT THE- THAT MAY PUT MY HOPE IS I'M WRONG BUT I BY MY INSTINCT IS THAT I'M NOT. AND WE NEED TO BE PUTTING A LOT MORE RESOURCES INTO THIS. WOULD ALSO SAY THAT- BECAUSE PRESCRIBED BURNS ARE DONE. A LOT OF TIMES BASED. THE RIGHT WINDOWS. AFTER THERE HAS BEEN POTENTIALLY RAIN- IN AN AREA TO HELP SLOW THESE FIRES DOWN- THE EMISSIONS ARE GOING TO BE LOWER- THESE UNCONTROLLED FIRES- LIKE WE HAD IN FROM THE LIGHTNING COMPLEX. WHERE THEY WERE LARGE INVERSION LAYERS THAT LITERALLY SAT THIS SMOKE DOWN IN DID NOT ALLOW IT TO GO ANYWHERE. NOW FOR DAYS AND DAYS UPON END WHERE THE SKY WAS RED AND WE- IT LOOKS ORANGE FOR DAYS- HAS TO HAVE. A MUCH DIFFERENT DIFFERENT. THEIR AND SO. THAT THESE UNCONTROLLED FIRES ARE HAPPENING AT TIMES WHEN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE NOT FAVORABLE WORSE PRESCRIBED BURNS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. BY OUR OWN REGULATION IN TIMES WHEN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE SO I THINK THAT THE OFFSET FOR THAT IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. YEAH I MEAN I WOULD SAY THAT I EIGHT OF THE SAME MINDSET THAT THESE A WILDFIRE EMISSIONS ARE WAY WORSE. THAN THE PRESCRIBED FIRES- I WOULD JUST. ONE DAY WE WERE TRACKING IT AND AS WITHIN THE COMPARISON THEY WERE INCLUDING BUT THE COMPARISON OF PRESCRIBED FIRES. WILDFIRES STATIONARY SOURCES SO FOR THE BUT ALSO THAT I THINK IN THAT MAKING SURE WE HAVE. PROPER I COUNTIES WITH THAT HAVE PROPER OFFSET TO MITIGATION FOR THEM I THINK FOR ME IT'S MORE WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE OF THIS AND AS FAR AWAY. YEAH WHAT ARE SOME OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES SO WE COULD ALSO MITIGATE FOR THAT AND THINK AHEAD FOR THAT. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. MY CONCERN WE WANTED THIS DATA BUT WE HAD TO LEGISLATIVE THE ASK FOR IT- THIS DATA SHOULD BE AVAILABLE NOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THESE FIRES BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS. WE HAD TO PUSH OUR OWN AGENCIES TO HELP PRODUCES DATA AND I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM. ANYTHING ELSE MISS GARCIA NO THANK YOU OKAY ARE ANY UP WITH ANY OF THE OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING DOES ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY AND THEN I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL VERY MUCH ARE YOU MAY WANT TO STAND BY BECAUSE MR FLOOR I HAD TO LEAVE BUT I THINK HE MAY HAVE QUESTIONS WHEN HE RETURNED SO IF YOU ARE ABLE. TO GREAT IF YOU CAN STAND BY THREE NEXT PANELS. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR SECOND PANEL ON STATE PRESCRIBED BY A FIRE EFFORTS. TOM PORTER WHO WE ALL KNOW VERY WELL THE DIRECTOR OF THE PERMANENT FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTON. AND MATT DAVIS EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE PANELISTS AND EVERYBODY ACTUALLY WHO'S LISTENING TO PLEASE KEEP YOUR- DEVICES ON MUTE BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING QUITE A BIT OF BACKGROUND NOISE AND FEEDBACK- TIME SO EVERYONE CAN BE MUTED WHEN YOU WERE NOT SPEAKING. THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU AND WITH THAT MISTER PORTER. STE WELL GOOD ACTORS. CHAIR OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY- MY NAME IS TOM PORTER- AND I AM OF THE STATE FORESTER AND DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION AS YOU KNOW AND I AM VERY HAPPY TO HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS- PRESCRIBED FIRE HAND WHAT WE'RE DOING IN CALIFORNIA- AS THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO- BROADLY ACROSS STATE AGENCIES IN THIS SPACE. I WILL FOREGO- GIVING YOU A FIRE SEASON UPDATE WHICH I OFTEN DO- DURING THESE- THESE BRIEFINGS- AND HEARINGS BUT YOUR BACKGROUND PAPER IS VERY THOROUGH STAFF A GREAT JOB OF PUTTING THAT TOGETHER. AND I WILL LEAVE THAT TO. SPEAK TO THE WHAT THE SEASON HAS BROUGHT US TO THIS YEAR. SO WHERE'S THAT TAKE US- WE TRULY ARE- SEEING THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN WE HAVE IN MY CAREER AND MY CAREER IS THIRTY YEARS AS A FORESTER- AND FIREWORKS- FIRE FIGHTERS. WHAT WHAT IS CLEAR IS THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO REALLY FURTHER HAS- THE FORESTRY AND FIRE COMMUNITY IS THIS ALLOF THE ABOVE APPROACH THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. AND WHILE- WHILST WILL FOCUS ON I WILL FOCUS ON A PRESCRIBED FIRE- I WOULD LIKE I CAN'T LET IT GO UNNOTICED OR RUN STATED. THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT. ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH WHEN TALKING ABOUT- FOREST HEALTH AND REDUCTION OF. RISK TO COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRE THAT INCLUDES. THAT ALL OF HE ABOVE APPROACH WE TRULY- IN SOME AREAS WELL WE NEED TO PUT MORE FIRE ON THE GROUNDS ARE PRESCRIBED FIRE- WE CAN'T DO THAT SAFELY AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE REALLY NEED TO DO- OTHER FUEL REDUCTION PROJECT WORK IN ORDER TO MAKE FOR A SAFE. A REINTRODUCTION FOR FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE AS THAT HAPPENS- TIME WILL WILL PASS AND WILL HAVE A LANDSCAPE THAT CAN RECEIVE FIRE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS NEEDED- ON A RETURN INTERVAL OF TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS WHATEVER IT NEEDS TO BE- WITHOUT ALL OF THAT ADDITIONAL WORK BUT RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO ALSO INVEST IN THOSE THINGS- THAT WILL MAKE IT SAFE TO PUT FIRE ON THE GROUND. TO THE SCALE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO. WE CAN'T FOR THAT OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STILL. ACROSS THE STATE IN SOME CASES ARE NOT- THE PLACE WHERE WE WANT TO PUT PRESCRIBED FIRE- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS IN SOME CASES THE WAY THE TOPOGRAPHY IS. OR THE WAY THE FUELS ARE AND WE NEED TO DO OTHER TYPES OF FUEL PROJECTS IN A HIM. MAINTAIN DEFENSIBLE SPACE- MAINTAIN. THE AND THE- AREAS AROUND HOMES AND- DO THE- HOME HARDENING THAT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT HOMES ARE. RESISTANT TO HAMBURGERS. SO WE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS AND THE SZE AND TYPE OF MEMBERS COMING IN BY REDUCING THE FUELS OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY WE HARDENED STRUCTURES WE HAVE THE DISPENSABLE SPACE. WE HAVE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH THAT TRULY REDUCES THE RISK OF WILDFIRE CONSUMING HOMES AND- GOD FOR BID WHOLE COMMUNITIES. SO PRESCRIBED. THIS IS THE FUTURE PRESCRIBED FIRE IS. BY FAR THE MOST ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE WAY TO TREAT THE LANDSCAPE THAT WE NEED TO IN ORDER TO RETURN TO A HEALTHY. ECOSYSTEM IN SOME CASES BUT ALSO HEALTHY RETURN RATE OF WILDFIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE OR JUST BUYER ON THE LANDSCAPE- TO REDUCE THOSE RISKS THAT I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. SO IN THE IN THE CALIFORNIA FOREST EFFORT SORRY CALIFORNIA FIRE. CALIFORNIA CARBON PLAN EXCUSE ME THERE'S SO MANY PLANS BUT THE CARBON PLAN IS SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO WE- IN OUR FORESTED ECOSYSTEMS INCREASES THE SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON. REDUCE OUR OUR- OUR EFFECTS ON THE LAND ARE ON THE AIR AND HANDY ON THE ON CLIMATE CHANGE ITSELF. AND SO ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS IT IS INVEST IN THINGS THAT WILL SEQUESTERING CARBON TREES FOREST SOILS SOILS IN GENERAL- AND VEGETATION ARE ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE WAYS TO DO SUCH. AND SO THROUGH THIS- WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT WE NEED TO DO ROUGHLY. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY OF TREATMENT IN FORESTED ECOSYSTEMS BUT THAT INCLUDES CHAPARRAL. OAK WOODLAND- DEEP DENSE FOREST IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AS WELL AS THE MEXICANA FOR IN THE MIDDLE AT ELEVATIONS ALL OF THAT AREA NEEDS SOME LEVEL OF FOREST HEALTH TREATMENT WHAT THAT'LL DO IS IT'LL INCREASE THE HEALTH OF THE OF THE VEGETATION THAT REMAINS ON THE LANDSCAPE PARTICULARLY THOSE LARGE TREES. AND THEY WILL SEE PLASTER CARBON FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. INTO THE FUTURE IF WE DO THIS RIGHT. SO WHAT WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH IS THE FOR SERVICE US FOREST SERVICE AND THE OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE COMMITTED TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AS WELL. AND BY THE BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE OUR INTENT IS TO HAVE BOTH OF THOSE SETS OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE TREATMENTS GOING ON ON THE LANDSCAPE ANNUALLY- AND- HALF OF THAT ON FEDERAL LANDS HALF OF THAT ON THE STATE AND PRIVATE LANDS. SO AS I MENTIONED MANY MANY TECHNIQUES ARE OUT THERE FOR. THE USE OF FUEL REDUCTION- TO REALLY GET US TO A BETTER PLACE- THE IN OUR OUR ABILITY TO- ALLOW FIRE TO BE UTILIZED ON THE LANDSCAPE. THE FIRST THAT WE USE AND SO OTHERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE SEQUEL COMPONENTS THE SMOKE MANAGEMENT PLANNING- AND DOWNED WHAT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT HERE IS EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT PROJECT THAT WE DO FOR PRESCRIBED BURNING REQUIRES A- VERY DETAILED PLAN AND YES I. MEMBER WOULD AYE HI HI I AGREE IN IN SOME CASES IT IS A LABORIOUS AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS IN ORDER TO PUT THAT PLAN TOGETHER- AND- WHAT WE NEED TO BE SURE TO- REFERENCE THOUGH IS THE VALUE OF PROTECTING THE- THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ON THE LANDSCAPE. SOMETIMES THOSE ARE CULTURAL SOMETIMES THEY ARE VEGETATION SOMETIME MEETING RARE PLANTS- THAT I HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH FIRE SOMETIMES THEY ARE MIGRATORY BIRDS OR OTHER- SLOWER AND FULLER I MEAN FANA THAT MAY BE SENSITIVE TO- THE FIRE OUR PRESCRIPTION. NEEDS TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS AND NEEDS TO PROTECT THOSE THINGS. ARE PROTECT THOSE NATURAL RESOURCES ON THE LANDSCAPE AND SO OR SOMETIMES IT TAKES A LONG TIME BUT AS TIME GOES ON AND WE GET TO AREAS WHERE WE BURNED OVER TIME I KNOW I WILL BE ABLE TO TAILOR OUR PRESCRIPTIONS MORE QUICKLY AND MORE READILY TO THOSE RESOURCES THAT ARE ON THE LANDSCAPE. WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM A PLACE WHERE WE REALLY DID NOT EMBRACE PRESCRIBED FIRE FOR THE LAST. WELL IN THE LAST YEARS WE HAVE. PRIOR TO THAT THERE WAS ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS WHERE IT WAS JUST SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE DOWN OF A DECLINE AS A TOOL OF USE. WE ARE. BUILDING THAT BACK. AND NOT ONLY ARE WE BUILDING THE EXPERTISE BACK BUT WE'RE ALSO BUILDING THE DATABASES OF. INFORMATION THAT REALLY TUNES OUR USE OF THE OF THIS A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL AND NEEDED TOOL ON THE LANDSCAPE. SO OUR PRESCRIPTION- THAT'S DEVELOPED OUT OF THIS PLAN GIVES US A WINDOW. AND WE'VE HEARD FROM DOCTOR STEVENS ABOUT. LOOKING AT WAYS TO INCREASE THE HOW WIDE THAT WINDOWS OPEN I AM VERY MUCH FOR THIS PERSPECTIVE VERY MUCH- WORKING WITH THE WITH THE PRACTITIONERS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION ALONG WITH OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS BUT I WILL BE WORKING WITH THE- LOCAL AND TRIBAL- PRACTITIONERS AS WELL. THROUGH VERY- APPROPRIATE PRESCRIPTIONS THAT OPEN THE WINDOW TO BE ABLE TO BURN AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR WHEN WE- WHEN WE HAVE AN OPEN WINDOW AND SOMETIMES THAT IS- IT COULD EVEN BE DURING A- WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY USED TO CALL THE FIRE SEASON. IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT CONDITIONS IT MIGHT BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO ACTUALLY BURKE CHIEF AYE AYE IF YOU TO PAY HE JUST CUT YOU OFF- WE'VE GONE UP BEYOND THE SEVEN MINUTES IF YOU COULD JUST WRAP UP- THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU. YES ABSOLUTELY I AM SORRY FOR GOING A LITTLE BIT LONGER- I WILL TIGHTEN IT UP TO SOME EXAMPLES. SO IT OFTEN COMES AS A AS I HAPPEN TO BE THE STATE FIRE CHIEF AS WELL IT'S OFTEN IT WILL HOW ARE THESE THINGS ACTUALLY HELPING YOU WHEN WE HAVE WILD FIRES. AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY. CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THIS RESILIENT LANDSCAPE TO FIRE AS I MENTIONED IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF AMBER PRODUCTION. IT REDUCES INTENSITY AS FIRES COME INTO COMMUNITIES ON THE CREEK FIRE- INDIAN- MADERA AND FRESNO COUNTY THERE WERE FIVE OF THE THIRTY FIVE- PROJECTS THAT- THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AND HAND GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM- ASKED ME TO MAKE SURE WORK DONE LAST YEAR. FIVE OF THE THIRTY FIVE WERE UTILIZED ALONG WITH PRESCRIBED BURNS ON SO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON LANDS. IN AND AROUND SHAVER LAKE THAT REALLY- SAVE THAT COMMUNITY- WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURE LOSS IN THAT AREA BUT THE CENTRE PIECE OF. SHAVER LAKE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY CONSUMED LIKE PARADISE HAD WE NOT DONE THOSE PROJECTS. AND HAD WE NOT HAD THOSE PRESCRIBED FIRES THAT OCCURRED IN THAT AREA CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT IS ALSO IN THE HEART OF THE TREE MORTALITY. AREA FROM A SEVERAL YEARS BACK AND- MUCH NEEDED PROJECT WORK THAT STATE THAT COMMUNITY- I WILL IT IS. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AT THE END I DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION RELATED TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU'VE ALREADY ASKED SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO COME BACK TO ANY OF THOSE I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE. AT THAT TIME THANK YOU WHEN WE COME BACK AT THE END OF THE PENALTY GREAT IF YOU HAVE SOME ANSWERS FROM I'M ASSUMING YOU MEANT FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL WE CAN YOU CAN. WELCOME TO SHARE YOUR ANSWERS WITH US WE'D LOVE TO HEAR THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND NOW WILL MOVE TO MATT DEUS. WELCOME WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE YES I AM THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITH THE STATE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION AND TODAY IT'S BEEN A FEW MINUTES WITH YOU TO TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM AND FOR THE BALANCE OF THIS PRESENTATION I'LL BE REFERRING IT TO REFERRING TO THE PROGRAM AS A CAL VTP. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A BRIEF HISTORY OF A JOB VTP OF THE WAY IN WHICH THIS PROGRAM WILL SURFACED- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- CHIPPING HIGHER STANDARDS OUR PACE AND SCALE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PRESCRIBED FIRE AS WELL AS OTHER VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAMS. OR OTHER TREE OF VEGETATION TREATMENT PROJECTS. AS ME THE BACKGROUND. THE CALIBRATED THE WIRES ARE WORKED ON BY THE STATE BOARD OF FORESTRY FIRE PROTECTION FOR. JUST OVER TEN YEARS AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST. YEAR OR SO OVER OVER THE COURSE OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE MADE A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT TO PUSH THE PROJECT OVER THE FINISH LINE IF YOU WELL AND ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE BOARD DID. APPROVE THE COUNTY D. P. PROGRAM AS WELL CERTIFIED TO SUPPORTING PROGRAM E. IR. OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR DEVELOPMENTS OF THE LAST YEAR DEVELOPMENT ARE WE REALLY FOCUSED OUR ENERGY WE TOOK A VERY COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WORKING WITH. I AM VERY LARGE PARTNERS STAKEHOLDER GROUP INCLUDED. MANY OF OUR AGENCY PARTNERS DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE- CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD STATE WATER BOARDS REGIONAL WATER BOARD SO ON AND SO FORTH AS WELL PART OF PARTNERS. TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THIS CAN BE WIDELY SUPPORTED. THE COLLABORATION THAT WE ENGAGED IN TRYING TO CHANGE THE VISION OF THE PROGRAM- IN THAT WE THE BOARD'S DR JEFFREY WHERE THE INITIAL. THE INITIAL P. E. I. R. THE NATIONAL PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON HAVING CAL FIRE BEAT THE NUMBER ONE AND ONLY SAW AGENCY THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS UNDER THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM BUT AS THE CHANGING WILDFIRE CONDITIONS IN THE STATE. ALONG WITH- GOAL SET FORTH I HAVE TREATMENT ON PRIVATE LANDS TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR. WITH ALL THAT IN THE BACKGROUND- WE CHANGE THE VISION OF THE PROGRAM TO BE NOT ONLY OUR PROGRAM BUT TO PAY BROAD PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO. ALL RELY UPON. I'M HERE TO STATE AGENCIES LOCAL AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE A PROGRAM TO EFFECTUATE THE CHANGE NECESSARY- IN THE STATE IS A LIST OF WILDFIRE PREVENTION. WITH THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO TREAT UP 252-005-0000 ACRES A YEAR AND THAT WOULD BE ON NON FEDERAL LANDS TO REPEAT REDUCE FAR WILDFIRE RISK AND ESTABLISH MORE NATURAL FIRE REGIMES ACROSS THE STATE- THE PROGRAM CONTAINS AN ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS. IMPLEMENTING VEGETATION TREATMENTS PROGRAMS AND THEREFORE. ADVISOR BROUGHT UP WITH YOU NEED FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECT PROPONENTS TO CONDUCT ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND EVENT AS REQUIRED BY SEQUINED AND EFFICIENT MANNER THE COUNTY T. PROGRAMS INTENDED TO ASSIST IN INCREASING PACE AND SCALE OF ALL VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE ALL VEGETATION TREATMENTS INCLUDING. PRESCRIBED FIRE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THE WHILE WE'RE LOOKING AT EFFICIENCY AS IT RELATES TO SEEK WELL WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO DRIVE ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED OUTCOMES AS WELL. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE- CHIEF PORTER INDICATED THIS IS ONE ONE PIECE OF A BROADER PREVENTION PROGRAM WHERE VEGETATION TREATMENT IS CRITICAL BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT- DEFENSIBLE SPACE BUILDING CODES LAND USE DECISIONS AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. NOW TO BE CLEAR THE TOP ETP DOES NOT FOCUS ON THOSE SPECIFICALLY BUT THE CHALVEY TP DOES SPOKE FOCUS SOLELY ON VEGETATION. TREATMENT BY THE BOARD OF COURSE IN FIRE PROTECTION CLEARLY RECOGNIZES THAT JUST ONE COMPONENT OF A LARGER PREVENTION STRATEGY IN THE STATE. ARE THE PROGRAM APPLIES. TO TWENTY POINT THREE MILLION ACRES THERE'S THE ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS SUPPORTS TO WORK ON TWENTY POINT THREE MILLION ACRES WHICH IS PRIMARILY WAS IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN FINDING INFORMATION IS REPLACED FREE ONE LANDSCAPE WE HAVE A LOT OF WEBSITE BUILT ON THE BOARD'S WEB PAGE WHERE YOU CAN SEE OR VIEW THE TRAVEL LANDSCAPE. THERE'S THREE PRIMARY THERE ARE THREE TREATMENT TYPES ARE AVAILABLE FOR- ANALYSIS UNDER OR FOR IMPLEMENTATION I SHOULD SAY THAT'S A WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE FUEL REDUCTION PROJECT. YOUR BRAKES AND ECOLOGICAL RESTAURANT RESTORATION SO IN TERMS OF TEARING THOSE OF THREE TREATMENT TYPES. DID SHE WAS THOSE TREATMENT TYPES THERE'S ACTUALLY FIVE DIFFERENT TREATMENT ACTIVITIES WE ARE PRESCRIBED BURNING MANUAL VEGETATION MECHANICAL TREATMENT PRESCRIBED PREPARE RAINY AND TARGETED BROWN APPLICATION OF HERBICIDES SO I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON TODAY'S HEARING IS FOCUSED ON PRESCRIBED FIRES ARE AT THE END OF THIS HEARING I WON'T ALREADY KNOW MY TESTIMONY WILL PROVIDE SOME VERY QUICK AYE TARGETS AS RELATES OUR GOALS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED UNDER THE PROGRAM. AS IT RELATES TO PRESCRIBE ARE SPECIFICALLY. THE PROGRAM ITSELF HAS EIGHTY WHAT IT CALLS ARE. SB FLOOR STAND ARE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THESE WOULD BE BMPS BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE POSSIBLE MITIGATION MEASURES. AND THOSE ARE BUILT OFF OF THE Y. LEVEL OF COLLABORATION THAT THE BOARD TOOK WILL BE DEVELOPED AS WITH OUR AGENCY STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING THE VARIOUS ARE. THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS THAT ARE ANALYZED UNDER THE AYE OURSELVES SO WE'RE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A STATIC VISUAL RESOURCES AREN'T LOGICAL HISTORICAL IN TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS HYDROLOGY WATER QUALITY. AND GENERALLY TO A FAX SO THERE'S ABOUT SEVENTEEN RESOURCE OBJECTS ARE ANALYZED MANY OF THOSE HAVE SUPPORTING- BMPS TO ASSURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE PROTECTED- AND- AND ONE ON ONE SUBJECT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON VERY QUICKLY THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. DATA CONVERSION. AND WHILE I. THINK THERE ARE WHEN I WAS OF FROM ONE I THINK OF. I'M SPEAKING CAN VENT US. ABOUT CONVERSE BUDGET. TYPES OF THE PROGRAM KNOWLEDGES A SHORTENED FIRE RETURN HOLE HAVE THAT SHORTEN FIRE RETURN INTERVALS. HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PRIMARY DRIVER OF CONVERSION ARE PRIMARILY IN COASTAL SAGE AND CHAPARRAL VEGETATION TYPES. AND IF NOT CONDUCTED APPROPRIATELY THAT PRESCRIBED FIRE COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT AND TYPE CONVERSION OF THOSE VEGETATION TYPES WITH WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT- COMMENT THAT WE HEARD DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAM AND HAS BEEN A DOCTOR HAS BEEN ADDRESSED WITHIN THE PROGRAM ITSELF. I NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT CONVERSION OF. ANY VETS TYPE INCLUDING SHOP ROLLER COASTAL SAGE IS NOT ALLOWED- IS DISALLOWED WITHIN THE PROGRAM. AND IT PROVIDES INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE TO INDIVIDUAL PROJECT PROPONENTS THAT WHEN THEY ARE DEVELOPING PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY AS THEY ARE WITHIN THOSE SENSITIVE EVENTS TYPES THAT THEY NEED TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON. REPLICATING NATURAL FIRE RESERVE. NATURAL FIRE REGIMES. AND RETURNING VEGETATION TYPES WITH CONDITION CLASS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO. THREE AREAS WHERE THE DEPARTURE OF A FIRE RETURN INTERVALS HAS DEVIATED AND TRY TO BRING IT BACK TO ITS ITS ORIGINAL PLAT CITY ASSIST YOU YOU'VE GONE BEYOND SEVEN MINUTES SO IF YOU CAN PLEASE. WRAP IT UP THANKS I. WRAP IT UP RIGHT NOW SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE SOME ONLINE RESOURCES AVAILABLE I DID SEE A MAP ONLINE WELL MY COLLEAGUE WAS SPEAKING MY DIRECTOR PORTER WAS SPEAKING. AND IN FACT ABOUT THAT SHOW WHERE THE PROJECTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED ACROSS THE STATE UNDER THE COUNTY TP. AND TO DATE. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED ACRES OF PRESCRIBED FIRE PROPOSED. KIND OF THE CALGARY TP. WHAT I HAVE NO FURTHER. THANK YOU MISTER DO YOU VERY HELPFUL WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO QUESTIONS NOW I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS TO BEGIN FOR REPORTER. I'M SORRY TO MAKE YOU GUYS CHANGE SEATS AGAIN. WE SHOULD HAVE GONE THE OTHER WAY TOO LATE. HI CHIEF THANK YOU. MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU IS WHETHER CAL FIRE HAS A GOAL FOR THE NUMBER OF BURN BOSSES YOU WANT TO CERTIFY AND HOW DO YOU WHAT IS THAT GOAL AND HOW DO YOU INTEND TO GET THERE. WE HAVE NOT SET A GOAL FOR NUMBER OF BURNT BOSSES I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS. EXPAND AND AN OPEN THAT PROGRAM AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO GET AS MANY AS WE CAN. WITH EXPERIENCE IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE AS WELL- I THINK. SOME AREAS OF THE STATE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH BETTER LUCK THAN OTHERS IN IN FINDING- THOSE TO TRAIN. THANK YOU. MY NEXT QUESTION IS HAVE WHETHER. HOW CALIFORNIA- IN THE FOREST SERVICE'S GOING TO SCALE UP TO TREAT. FEDERAL LANDS GIVEN THE ONE MILLION ACRE- GOAL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- STEP BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE FOREST SERVICE HOW DO YOU PLAN. TO SCALE UP TO HIT THOSE GOALS. WELL IN. ON THE STATE LANDS- WE ARE CURRENTLY SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ANNUALLY WE'VE BEEN AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ACRES THAT WE DO. ASK HELLFIRE BUT CAL FIRE IS EXPECTED IN THAT- IN THAT PLAN TO PROVIDE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY. SO THE REST OF THOSE ACRES ARE GOING TO COME FROM. OTHER PARTNERS IN PRIVATE- PRIVATE LANDS- CONSERVANCY LANDS WERE WORKING WITH OUR OUR SISTER- DEPARTMENTS IN- IN RESOURCES TO EXPAND THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE BUT ALSO OTHER FUELS TREATMENT. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE THOSE- CRITICAL RESOURCES AS WELL. THANK YOU I'M BECAUSE OF TIME CONSTRAINTS WE WEREN'T ABLE TO HAVE A RB AT THIS HEARING BUT I'M WONDERING HOW YOU WOULD CHARACTERIZE QUALIFIERS WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IN REGARDS TO PER SCRIPT OR SCRUB FIRE. AND WHETHER THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR PROVIDED TO LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS WITH THAT ASSISTED WITH PERMITTING. PRESCRIBED FIRES. CERTAINLY THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I WILL SAY THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY GETTING BETTER AND BETTER- WE'RE STARTING TO SEE. AND THIS IS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE PROBABLY THE LAST FIVE YEARS A CONSISTENT INCREASE IN- TRUST UP EACH OTHER AND HOW WE'RE- MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE- BURNING PUBLIC- I MEAN THE BURNING PROFESSIONALS AND THE PUBLIC. THANKS AND WHAT ABOUT GETTING MORE PRESCRIBED FIRE- INSTITUTED ON LANDS LIKE STATE PARKS AND DEMONSTRATION FORESTS ARE THERE ANY PLANS RIGHT NOW TO DO THAT. ABSOLUTELY AND OF THE Z. CAL PTP- THAT- THAT MY COLLEAGUE- JUST TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY- IT WILL BE THE TOOL THAT ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN IT'S A TOOL THAT'S NOT JUST CAL FIGHTER CENTRIC NOR IS IT JUST- CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCY CENTRIC. IT IS VERY MUCH A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED FOR THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE AND PLANNING SO THAT WE DO- THE RIGHT THINGS TO PUT THE RIGHT FIRE ON THE RIGHT LANDED AT THE RIGHT TIME. AND GET THAT PRESCRIBED FIRE ACREAGE INCREASED THANK YOU AND I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR MR DS BEFORE THE WE DO THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE SWITCHING CHAIRS LET'S SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS QUESTIONS FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY. OKAY OUR DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU CHIEF PORTER- AND I SUPPOSE SAY THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOUR AGENCY IS DONE TO PROTECT LIVES AND PROPERTY- I GOT BACK YOU WAITED AGAIN THIS YEAR AND A FIRE CAME WITHIN A COUPLE OF MILES OF MY HOUSE I'M REALLY GRATEFUL. FOR EVERYTHING YOU GUYS DID SO I HAVE A HOME TO LIVE IN NOW- BUT OTHERS WERE NOT QUITE SO LUCKY. APPRECIATE THAT YOU TOUCHED ON THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM- TASK. FOR YOU GUYS TO WORK ON. I THINK THERE ARE EIGHT DEDICATED CRUISE TOWARDS THAT ARE OUT I THINK THEY'RE EIGHT CREWS THEY'RE SUPPOSED THE WORKING ON FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. YEAR ROUND. CONSIDERING THE BACKLOG OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IS THERE GOING TO BE A MOVE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF THOSE CREWS AND- AND THE DISPERSION OF THEM. I DO UNDERSTAND I HEARD. A TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE BUT I HEARD THAT. THOSE SOME OF THOSE CREWS WERE ACTUALLY DEAD YOU KNOW PULLED OFF THEIR- THEIR PREVENTION WORKED ACTUALLY HELP FIGHT FIRES THIS YEAR. MAYBE I'D MAYBE HURTING CORRECTLY BUT I BY WAS AN IMPRESSION THOSE ARE GONNA BE DEDICATED YEAR ROUND CRUISE. ONCE AGAIN I RECOGNIZE THIS WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED YEAR. BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT EVEN A PRESCRIBED BURNS THAT I'VE SEEN THAT ARE BEING SET UP THERE'S A LOT OF VEGETATION WORK THAT GOES INTO DOING THOSE BEFORE THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO THE BURN. SO I'M BIG ON PREVENTION DOLLAR PREVENTION SAVE SIX DOLLARS ON TREATMENT- AND SO YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S HEALTHCARE OR FORESTRY OR WHATEVER- ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE RESOURCES PUT TOWARDS PREVENTION- AND THREE SPECIFICALLY AROUND SOME OF THESE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJECTS. WELL REMEMBER WHAT THAT IS- ABSOLUTELY- A- SPOT ON QUESTION FOR WHERE WE ARE IN INCOME YEAH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS- THE IT'S TEN ACTUALLY- FUELS DEDICATED FUELS CREWS- THAT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER AND- YOU HIT IT I WON'T SAY IT ANYMORE THAN THE WAY YOU DID WE DID PUT THOSE FIREFIGHTERS ON- THE- THE SHORTAGE OF RESOURCES ON THE AMOUNT OF FIRE THAT WAS-BURNING ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. WE BROUGHT THEM BACK OFF OF THOSE ASSIGNMENTS AS SOON AS WE COULD THEY WENT BACK TO- DOING FUELS PROJECT WORK AND JUST FOR REFERENCE WE WERE BURNING- ON PROJECTS UP TO THE WEEK BEFORE- AUGUST FIFTEENTH WHICH IS WHEN THE WHEN THE LIGHTNING HAPPENS. AND THEN IN SEPTEMBER WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE WE FOUND A COUPLE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO- DO SOME OF CLEAN UP BURNING THAT WE NEEDED TO AND THEN AND THEN MORAN ON OCTOBER AND WERE BURNING AS WE SPEAK- AND THOSE CREWS WERE CRITICAL TO BEING ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN- WHAT THE BIGGER PICTURE A IS AND I WILL BE LABOR IT- BUT OUR- OUR REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF INMATE CREWS THAT WE HAVE. IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALSO A PART OF THIS EXPANSION YES WE WANT TO EXPAND OUR FUELS GROUP PROGRAM- WE NEED TO BALANCE THAT WITH WITH OUR- CONSERVATION CAMP CREWS THAT ARE THAT ARE BOTH INMATE AND CCC AS WELL AS FUELS CREWS AND FIND A BALANCE- THAT WORKS FOR A GETTING THIS WORK DONE ON THE LANDSCAPE AND ALSO PROVIDING THE NECESSARY FIREFIGHTERS WHEN WE DO HAVE- CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER. AND ONE LAST PIECE IS A INMATE- FIRE FIRE CREWS- WILL ACTUALLY ABOUT THEIR WORK DAYS ABOUT 45% OF THOSE DAYS ARE ON FUEL REDUCTION PROJECT WORK- A FIREFIGHTER HAND CREW IT'S APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE DAYS OF THEIR- BUT THEIR WORK IS DONE- I MEAN 75% OF THE TIME IS ON- FUELS REDUCTION PROJECT WORK. AND THEN- THE FUELS CREWS OF COURSE THERE IN THE. 9295% THANK YOU. I THINK YOU'RE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO HAVE QUESTIONS FOR CHIEF PORTER. OKAY WELL TO PORTER ONCE AGAIN THANKS FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY AND THANKS FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR AGENCY DOES THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOOKS TO ALL OF YOU IS AS HEROES RIGHT NOW SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN BRING MISTER DE IS BACK. FOR QUESTIONS. FOR ALL. THANKS OF MISTER DE IS A SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS MENTIONED THE TIME THAT SEEK WOULD TAKES. AND THE BURDEN IT PUTS ON SOME OF THESE PROJECTS IN TERMS OF COST AND TIME. AND I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH TIME. HELLO THAT YOU EXPECT CAL VTP TO BE ABLE TO SAVE THE AVERAGE PROJECT IN COMPLYING WITH SYKORA I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT THAT FIRST OF ALL. WE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF PROJECTS THAT ARE HAVE DEDICATED STAFF TO THE MORE BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS. TEN WEEKS A SUMMER LONG OUTLINED TO HALF MONTHS WHEREAS IN THE PAST. IF YOU'RE ENGAGED IN THE PREPARATION OF AN ER TO SUPPORT A PROJECT THERE COULD BE UPWARDS OF A YEAR OR MORE SO I THINK THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS VERA. IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK THERE'S ALSO SOME ARE SOME CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE FACT THAT. MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES CAN BE CONTEMPLATED UNDER CALVI TV PROJECT WHERE THAT IS NOT AN AVAILABLE OPTION I'M VERY STANDARD SUPER ANALYSIS SO FOR INSTANCE. A AYE WELL PLANNED PROJECT THAT INCLUDES INITIAL TREATMENTS AS WELL AS MAINTENANCE TREATMENTS COULD BE EFFECTUATED OVER THE COURSE OF. YEARS WHERE THOSE STAIR STEPS OF THERE'S MULTIPLE STEPS. OF INITIAL TREATMENT AND MAINTENANCE. ALL RIGHT TRIGGERED A NECESSITY FOR I. SEQUENCE SO THE POINT IS THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SAVINGS UP FRONT. BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS IN TERMS OF WELL PLANNED PROJECTS AS THEY RELATE TO THE MAINSTREAM IT'S IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. YEAH THANK YOU COUPLE QUESTIONS SO WITH REGARDS TO THAT- JUST THINKING ABOUT THE SECRET PROCESS- IS IT POSSIBLE THAT- GROUPS OF. PEOPLE WITHIN A PRESCRIBED BURN ASSOCIATION ALL CONTEMPLATING DOING SO SMALL BURNS IN AN AREA COULD BAND TOGETHER TO CREATE A SINGLE SEQUIN DOCUMENT. THAT THAT MORE PROGRAMMATIC FOR THE GENERAL AREA RATHER THAN HAVING TO DO INDIVIDUAL SECRET DOCUMENTS FOR PROPERTIES IT MAY EVEN BE A JOINING TO ONE ANOTHER IS THAT ENVISIONED UNDER THE VTP PLAN. I DON'T IS ENVISIONED IT'S ALSO BEEN EFFECTUATED IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE THREE PROJECTS. THIS PROGRAM IS IN ITS INFANCY TEN AND A HALF MONTHS ORDER SO. BUT WE HAVE DO WE DON'T WIND UP WALK PROJECT- IN YUBA COUNTY THAT HAS MULTIPLE LANDOWNERS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND SO THAT'S NOT ONLY CONTEMPLATED IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENED- SO YES THE ANSWER IS YES YOUR QUESTION AND ALSO- WHAT HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED ON HERE AT ALL IS- THE POTENTIAL FOR AND BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING OF WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING MOST ABOUT PRESCRIBED FIRE BUT- BUT THE USE. OF LET OF A GRAZING FOR EXAMPLE- ACTIVITIES TO HELP WITH- SOME OF THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ISSUES SO FOR EXAMPLE I'LL GIVE YOU. LAST YEAR. I SAW IT WAS MAY HAVE BEEN THE YEAR BEFORE AND IT WAS LAST YEAR- OF THE HOP LINDFIELD STATION IN MY IN MY DISTRICT. HAVING HAD A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF WHERE GREAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH GRAZING ON ONE SIDE OF A FENCE. AND NOT GRAZING ON ON THE OTHER. AND THE EFFECT THAT THE FIRE THAT THE- MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE HAD ON THE LAND. AND IT WAS STARKLY- SHOULD STARKLY DIFFERENT THE LAND THAT HAD GRAZING- WILL WAS ON ITS WAY TO RECOVERY THE LAND THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY GRAZING ON IT. LOOKED DEVASTATED- AND SO AS- YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK TO THIS AND I THINK I THINK EVEN THOUGH GOVERNOR BROWN. HAS GOATS ON HIS PROPERTY OCCASIONALLY TO HELP WITH THAT- REMOVING- BRUSHING THINGS FROM THERE- IT IS THERE IS THERE ANY ARE PROVISIONS TO HELP ADVANCE SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES. THAT YOU KNOW WE MONITOR OBVIOUSLY WANT THESE GRAZING ACTIVITIES TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND- RESPECTIVE OF THE ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE TO THE LANDSCAPE. THAT THAT THESE THAT THIS MIGHT BRING IS THAT IS IN ANYWHERE ASSOCIATE WITH THE VTP PROCESS. S. WE TALK. THAT THEY TREATMENT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ANALYZE AND AVAILABLE FOR USE THERE'S FIVE OF THEM. PRESCRIBED FIRE BEING WINE WHICH I HIGHLIGHTED TODAY BUT ALSO TARGETED- BEVERLY OR TARGETED GRAZING- CROWN APPLICATION OF HERBICIDES- MASTICATION EFFORTS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY EQUIPMENT REMOVING PRICE. AS WELL AS IMPROVED SO THERE'S. FIVE TWO TIMES ARE VERY VERY IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU THE ARE THERE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WERE WITH US REMOTELY WHO WOULD LIKE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY HEARING NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR DS BAILEY INTERESTING PRESENTATION VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. ARE MOVING NOW TO OUR LAST. AND LARGEST PANEL ON CULTURAL AND FIRE RESILIENCY BURNING. A JOINING US WILL BE BILL TRIPP DIRECTOR OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY FROM THE CREW TRIED TO DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES. MARGO ROBBINS CO FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CULTURAL FIRE MANAGEMENT COUNCIL MEMBER OF YUROK TRIBE. DAN PORTER FIRST PROPRIETOR DIRECTOR FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND STEPHEN BYRD SENIOR MANAGER VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FORESTRY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON- MISTER TRIP I BELIEVE EUROPE FIRST AND I WILL. AGAIN REMIND ALL OF THE PANELISTS TO PLEASE KEEP YOUR- DEVICES ON MUTE UNLESS YOU'RE SPEAKING AND TO PLEASE BE MINDFUL OF THE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER TRIP WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. THIS IS MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT DELIVERING TESTIMONY IN A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND I AM THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. MANY OF THE RISKS POSED BY WELFARE TODAY A REALLY APPARENT. THE FIRE NARRATIVE IN MOST EVERYTHING WE READ TODAY SEEMS TO BEGIN WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES HAVE USE FIRE FOR MILLENNIA. THIS IS TRUE WE HAVE ALSO FACED A STATE AND FEDERAL SANCTIONED LEGACY OF DISPOSSESSION DISENFRANCHISEMENT AND DIMINISHMENT OF TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY THROUGHOUT AN ERA OF COLONIZATION FIRE EXCLUSION. THE NATIONAL COHESIVE WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY ROLLED OUT AS A DOCTOR IN A FIRE MANAGEMENT FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES ARE NOW CALLING SHARED STEWARDSHIP. THIS STRATEGY VERY SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSES FEDERAL TRIBAL STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND NGO PARTNERS AS AN ORDER OF OPERATIONS OF SORTS A TEARING OF RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG SOVEREIGNS. JURISDICTIONS IN ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PUBLIC AND TRAVEL TRUS. HE TRIED TO REMAIN AN AFTERTHOUGHT WE'RE CONTINUE TO BE REQUIRED TO WAIVE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IF THEY WISHTO RECEIVE FUNDING BE CONSIDERED QUALIFIED TO BURN. OR HAVE THE MEANS TO PARTICIPATE THE LOAN LEAD. CALIFORNIA IS NOW ONE OF THE STATE'S THAT CARRIES A STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE CREW TRIBE ALSO HAS A STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE MAINTAIN A VARIETY OF GRANTS AGREEMENTS CONTRACTS AND COMPAQ'S. WE ARE DEMONSTRATING HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO GET TO MEANINGFUL SCALE WELL USING OUR STRENGTHS TO OVERCOME EACH OTHER'S WEAKNESSES MAKING US ALL STRONGER AS WE LEARN TO WORK BETTER TOGETHER. A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEADER IN QUALIFIER ASK ME WHAT IS TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY. I WAS SO SHOCKED AT THE QUESTION I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER IT. THIS IS WHERE WE STILL ARE AT AT THE CONVERSATION TODAY. SIMPLY PUT SOVEREIGNS IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY HAVE CONSTITUTIONS THE HOUSE LINE HER GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS ARE JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITIES ARE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF SOCIAL POLITICAL INFLUENCES THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE OPERATE WITHIN. WHEN ONE BEGINS TO TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT SOVEREIGNTY IS THEY BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT BEING FORCED FROM AN INDIGENOUS GOVERNANCE SYSTEM TO OPERATE UNDER AN OFFICIAL CONSTITUTION AND IT'S A IS IN ITSELF AN ACT OF SUFFERING DIMINISHMENT. THE SYSTEMIC INJUSTICES INVOLVED IN OUR CURRENT REALITIES ARE ASTOUNDING. YOU MAY BE THINKING HOW DOES THIS EQUATE TO ADDRESSING WILDFIRE RISK WELL EXPANDING THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE INCLUDING CULTURAL BURNING. IN SEVEN MINUTES ALL I CAN DO IS START THE CONVERSATION. WHAT IS A RISK TO THE CURRENT PEOPLE IS OUR VERY OWN INDIGENOUS IDENTITY. OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FIRE IS ONE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE NATURAL TO PLACE. REVITALIZING OUR HUMAN FOR RELATIONSHIPS IS PARAMOUNT TO THIS THE PRESERVATION OF OUR CULTURAL CULTURAL IDENTITY. THIS IS WHY WE SEPARATE PRESCRIBED FIRE FROM CULTURAL BURNING IN THE DISCUSSION. WE CAN PRESCRIBE ALL OF OUR WE WANT AND WE CAN USE IT AS A GREAT SHARED STEWARDSHIP. AND SHARED LEARNING TOOL. BUT UNTIL OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FIRE RESUMES ITS PLACE AS A CULTURAL PROCESS THAT ALIGNS WITH THE INDIGENOUS SOCIAL ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR HOMELANDS. WE WILL NOT EVEN BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF IN HERE OF A FIRE SOLUTION COUPLED WITH THE CHANGING CLIMATE. THIS LATER FIRE JUST BURNED ABOUT HALF THE HOUSES IN HAPPY CAMP. THE CORRECT NAME FOR HAPPY CAMP MEANS THE PLACE WHERE HAZEL CREEK FLOWS THROUGH. THAT TELLS A STORY IN ITSELF AS TO THE CULTURAL VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS ONCE ABUNDANT ON THE LANDSCAPE. A GOOD PORTION OF THIS AREA WAS CONVERTED BY THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE FOR THE PERPETUAL PRODUCTION OF TIMBER. AT ONE TIME WE WERE AND EXTENSIVELY IN THE FIRST TWO MILES FROM OUR VILLAGES. SPOTTING ON THE SLITTER FIR WERE CONSISTENTLY REPORTED AS OCCURRING TWO MILES IN FRONT OF THE FIRE. THIS IS NOT COINCIDENCE. WE'RE STARTING OVER THERE NOW AND WE NEED TO INTEGRATE OUR INDIGENOUS AND WESTERN SCIENCES TO RESTORE THESE LANDSCAPES BACK TO A SOCIALLY ECOLOGICALLY RESILIENT STATE. AS OPPOSED TO APPROACHING. THE SITUATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOCIAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY ALONE. THE LATTER WILL CREATE CONDITIONS THE BURN A HIGH SEVERITY AGAIN AND AGAIN AT EXTREMELY HIGH COSTS. THE CURRENT CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLAN BEGINS TO CALL OUT WE USED TO START DOWN THIS PATH OF ECO CULTURAL REVITALIZATION. IT INTRODUCES SOME OUTSIDE THE BOX THINKING WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMIC MODELS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND CONSERVATION WITHOUT CREATING MECHANISM FOR SOCIAL ECONOMICS TO TRUMP SOCIALLY ECOLOGICALLY SOUND OUTCOMES. THE CALLS FOR THE RECOGNITION OF TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND FOCUSED ATTENTION ON WATER TO FISH WILDLIFE PLANTS AND THE PEOPLE. BUT THIS IN ITSELF IS JUST A FOUNDATION A POSITIVE FUTURE STILL NEEDS TO BE BUILT. CREATING RELIABLE FUNDING STREAMS DRESSING LIABILITY ISSUES HONORING SOVEREIGNTY AND RETHINKING APPROACHES TO OVERCOME THE SUITE OF BARRIERS WE FACE ARE ALL PART OF THE DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO SAY BUT NO TIME TODAY. WE ARE WORKING TO BUILD A GREATER COALITION WORKING TO EXPAND UPON COLLECTED THE A COLLECTIVE INDIGENOUS VOICE AND WORKING TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF ON THE GROUND ACTION IN OUR ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS AT THE SAME TIME. WE SEE CREWS FUNDED FOR PRESCRIBED BURNING BUT DON'T SEE THEM COME HELP US WITH OUR BURNS. WE CAN'T ASK FOR PERMITS WITHOUT DIMINISHING OUR SOVEREIGNTY. OUR PARTNERS CAN'T GET PERMITS WHEN SELLING CALIFORNIA IS IN THE HEIGHT OF FIRE SEASON. WE CAN'T MAINTAIN CONSISTENT CAPACITY BECAUSE WE RELY ON GRANTS. WE ARE LIMITED TO THE GRANTS WE CAN PURSUE BECAUSE STATE LAW POLICY AND REGULATION HAS NOT CONSIDERED THE NEEDS LET ALONE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. THERE ARE MANY SUCH TOPICS THAT ARE RIPE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. THIS TESTIMONY IS A CALL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REMOVE ANY UP POSSIBLE OBSTACLES THAT LIMIT TRAVEL BURNING PRACTICES AND FOR THE STATE TO FULL SUPPORT AND LEARN FROM OUR CULTURAL BURNING PRINCIPLES. THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE PROPPING. THE STATE SHOULD BE PROPPING UP TRAVEL CAPACITY NOT LIMITING IT THANK YOU FOR STARTING THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU MISTER TRIP AND IF YOU DON'T MIND- STAYING AROUND UNTIL THE END OF THE PANEL FOR QUESTIONS. AND BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT PANELIST I DO JUST WANT TO SAY- THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT SEVEN MINUTES IS CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR US TO A FULLY ENGAGED IN ALL OF THESE ISSUES BUT I ALSO WILL COMMIT TO CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU- AFTER- THIS PANEL'S COMMENCED THROUGHOUT THE NEXT YEAR- NEXT WILL GO TO MARGO ROBBINS. WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I CREATE NEXT NOW MARGO ROBBINS KEYCHAIN ACTOR YOU ARE TRIBAL MEMBER CO FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CULTURAL FIRE MANAGEMENT COUNCIL AS WELL AS KOHLI FOR THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE BURN NETWORK. I'M HONORED TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE INFORMATION TO GIVE YOU A SMALL GLIMPSE INTO WHAT FIRE MEANS TO US AS NATIVE PEOPLE AND HOW THE CULTURAL FIRE MANAGEMENT COUNCIL HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL IN SAFELY RETURNING FIRE TO THE LAND. THE CULTURAL FIRE MANAGEMENT COUNCIL SEE FMC IS A COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION LOCATED ON THE YUROK RESERVATION IN FAR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OUR COMMUNITY IDENTIFIED FIRE AS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING. ON THE USE OF FIRE THE COMMUNITY IS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FUEL BUILDUP ON THE LAND WILL OUR ELDERS BE ABLE TO ESCAPE IF THERE'S A WILDFIRE. THE C. A B. M. C. WAS FORMED AS A MEANS TO REINSTATE TRADITIONAL BURN PRACTICES AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY FROM WILDFIRE. ARE THE SLIDE SHOWING COULD SOMEBODY YES THEY ARE FLY YES YES YOU'RE NOW ON THE I THINK THE SECOND SLIDE OUT WANTED NUMBER TWO PLEASE. NATIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BURNING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS FIRE IS A NATURAL PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND WE AS HUMANS ARE PART OF NATURE. OUR LAND SISTERS LIVED IN A SPIRITUALLY BALANCED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LAND AND FIRE WAS A CRITICAL PART OF MAINTAINING THIS BALANCE. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR SACRED OBLIGATION TO CARE FOR THE LAND AND THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT LIVE THERE WE MUST USE BUYERS TO METHODICALLY BURN FROM THE COASTLINE TO THE HIGH COUNTRY. THIS LAND EVOLVED WITH FIRE SOME PLANTS ARE FIRE DEPENDENT WHILE OTHERS BENEFIT FROM FIRE. TRADITIONALLY EACH FAMILY EACH. TRIBE TOOK PERSONAL RESPONSE. FOR ME THE LAND WITH BUYER. NATIVE PEOPLE HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION TO THE LAND AND INTRICATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ELEMENT THAT AFFECT THE USE OF BUYER SO MUCH SO OUR ANCESTORS WERE ABLE TO BURN YEAR ROUND. IT'S TIME TO RETURN TO THIS TRADITIONAL PRACTICE OF CARING FOR THE LAND. IT'S TIME FOR TRIBES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES NGOS AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO JOIN FORCES TO RETURN THE CYCLES OF BURNING FROM THE COASTLINE TO THE HIGH COUNTRY. PRESCRIBED FIRE CAN BE USED TO REDUCE THE SPREAD AND IMPACT OF WILDFIRE AND AS A LAND RESTORATION TOOL. THE CULTURAL FIRE MANAGEMENT COUNCIL THE YUROK AND KARUK TRIBES HAVE BEEN. DOING CULTURAL BURNS FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW WE'VE ADAPTED TRADITIONAL FIRE PRACTICES. TO ACCOMMODATE THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE AND LAWS WE NOW LIVE WITH. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. TWICE A YEAR ONCE IN THE SPRING AND ONCE IN THE FALL SEE FMC IN THE YUROK TRIBE PLANS AND IMPLEMENTS A CULTURAL BURN TRAINING EXCHANGE TRACKS ON THE UPPER YUROK RESERVATION WE BURN ON PRIVATE VIEW LAND AS WELL AS LAND OWNED BY THE YUROK TRIBE. FIREFIGHTERS FROM ACROSS THE US AND ABROAD COME HELP US BURN OUR LAND WHILE INCREASING THEIR FIREFIGHTER QUALIFICATIONS. TRICKS EVENTS LAST BETWEEN ONE TO TWO WEEKS AND PROVIDE HANDS ON EXPERIENCE IN PRESCRIBED FIRE AN ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION WHILE CREATING FIRE BREAKS FOR WILDFIRE PROTECTION. THESE LOW INTENSITY CONTROLLED BURNS ARE GOOD FOR THE LAND WATER PLANTS ANIMALS AND THE PEOPLE. AS NATIVE PEOPLE WE DEPEND ON FIRE FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF OUR CULTURE. SOME OF THE PLANTS WE ON FOR BASKET WEAVING NEED FIRE IN ORDER TO REPRODUCE OUR TRADITIONAL SOURCES SUCH AS DEER SALMON ACORNS AND BERRIES ALL BENEFIT FROM FIRE. FIRE IMPROVES ANIMAL HABITAT INCREASES FOREST RESILIENCE AND BIO DIVERSITY THE BIO CHAR LEFT IN ITS WAKE MAKES THE SOIL MORE FERTILE PURIFIES THE WATER AND SHE QUAESTORS CARBON IN THE SOIL. A BY PRODUCT OF TRADITIONAL BURN PRACTICES IS WILDFIRE PROTECTION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SOMETIMES DURING TRACKS IT RAINS AND WE CAN'T DO BROADCAST BURNS THIS IS ONE PILE BURNS COME IN HANDY. C. FMC DOESN'T GENERALLY PREFER PILE BURNING AS IT BURNS REALLY HOT IN ONE PLACE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND MAY KILL THE SOIL. SOMETIMES IT'S THE ONLY OPTION GO. PILE BURNING REDUCES THE FUEL LOAD BUT DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE BENEFITS OF BROADCAST BURNS. NEXT SLIDE. C. FMC IN THE KAROO TRIBE HAVE STARTED A FAMILY LED BURN PROGRAM TO BRING BACK THIS TRADITIONAL WAY OF BURNING WE HELP FAMILIES BURN AROUND THEIR HOMES AND GATHERING AREAS FROM MID OCTOBER THROUGH APRIL THIRTY FIRST CALIFORNIA DOESN'T IT THIS IS DURING THE TIME CAL FIRE DOESN'T REQUIRE OR PERMIT OR A BURN PLAN. WE HOST COMMUNITY CLASSES ON SAFE BURN PRACTICES HELP PEOPLE PREP THEIR LAND SO THE FIRE STAYS INSIDE THE INTENDED BURN AREA AND BRING OUR FIRE ENGINE A STAND BY ON THE DAY OF THE BURN MORE AND MORE FAMILIES ARE STARTING TO USE FIRE AGAIN. CFO M. C. ALSO HAS A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN WE USE MORE MULTIPLE MEDIA SOURCES. TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF PRESCRIBED BURNS WE ALSO HAVE A PROGRAM IN THE SCHOOLS TO TEACH. STUDENTS ABOUT GOOD FIRE BEFORE THE CUPBOARD PANDEMIC THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL OFFERED A BASIC THIRTY TWO FIREFIGHTING CLASS. TWO OF THE STUDENTS THAT GRADUATED WITHIN THE LAST TWO WEEKS YEARS ARE NOW ON THE YUROK TRIBE FIRE CREW. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE WORLD IS TALKING ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE MEGA FIRES AND PROP PRESCRIBED FIRE IS COMING TO THE FORE IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY STRATEGIES. THE ISSUE OF SMOKE IS OFTEN A STICKING POINT AND THERE IS A NEED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THEIR SMOKE OPTIONS. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A NO SMOKE OPTION. WE WILL EITHER HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF WOOD SMOKE FROM PRESCRIBED BURNS OR MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TOXIC SMOKE FROM WILDFIRES MUCH CHOOSE THEIR SMOKE. TODAY I'M SHARING THE STRATEGIES THAT WE AS A NONCE SMALL AS A WE AS A SMALL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION HAVE USED TO BRING FIRE BACK TO THE LAND TO LET OTHERS KNOW THAT IF WE CAN DO IT OTHERS CAN TOO. OUR EFFORTS ARE REPLICABLE IN OTHER PLACES. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS ARE CONSTANTLY REACHING OUT TO US ASKING US TO TEACH THEM HOW TO SAFELY BURN THEIR LAND. BUYER MUST BE RETURNED TO THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE SO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR HOMES FROM WILDFIRE AND REAP THE BENEFITS FIRE PROVIDES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. CAL FIRE IS GEARING UP TO IMPLEMENT A BURN BOSS CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR PRIVATE LANDOWNERS SEE FMC PLANS TO DESIGN A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR LANDOWNERS TO GAIN THE PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE TO ATTAIN THIS CERTIFICATION THIS WILL HELP PUT FIRE BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS CAN BURN THEIR LAND WHILE TRIBES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND NGOS BURN AT A LANDSCAPE LEVEL WE SHOULD BE DOING LANDSCAPE LEVEL BACK BURN AND BEFORE WHILE SUCH BUYERS SEASON STARTS AS A METHOD OF WILDFIRE PREVENTION. IF WE WANT TO EXPAND THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE WE MUST UTILIZE EVERY AVAILABLE RESOURCE IN EVERY AVAILABLE BURN WINDOW TO REINSTITUTE TRADITIONAL FIRE REGIMES WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD A CULTURE OF UYERS THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL ETHNICITIES AND SOCIAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF CALIFORNIA IN FACT ALL STATES HAD A GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD FOR PRESCRIBED BURN LIABILITY. PRESCRIBED BURN PROGRAMS NEED TO BE FULLY FUNDED AND STAFFED CULTURAL BURN SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS AND FINALLY WE NEED TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE ABOUT FIRE THERE IS SUCH A THING AS GOOD FIRE IT IS A NECESSARY PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM. EVERY DAY IS A GOOD DAY TO BURN SOMEWHERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU DON'T MIND- STAYING AROUND UNTIL AFTER FOR QUESTIONS PRESHEAF THE POWER POINT. I NEXT WE HAVE DAN PORTER FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FRIEDMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS DAN PORTER I'M HERE ON BEHALF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. JUST SHARE WHY WE THINK PRESCRIBED FIRE TOGETHER WITH ECOLOGICALLY BASED THAN IN OUR FORESTS IS CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. BEGAN APPLYING PRESCRIBED FIRE TO ITS NATURE PRESERVES IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO. AND NOW LEADS THE LARGEST NON GOVERNMENTAL PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAM IN THE NATION. TODAY OUR SCIENTISTS AND FIRE PRACTITIONERS CONVENE AND PARTICIPATE IN DOZENS OF PRESCRIBED FIRE TRAININGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVERY YEAR. FOR THE RECORD I'M SUBMITTING THE NATURE CONSERVANCY'S CASE FOR ECOLOGICAL FORESTRY THIS EIGHT PAGE PUBLICATION SUMMARIZES HOW SELECTIVE THINNING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE WHEN USED TOGETHER CAN RESTORE FOREST BIODIVERSITY. AND MODERATE THE RISK OF HIGH INTENSITY WILDFIRES. REGARDING THE SCIENCE I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT THREE KEY FINDINGS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FIRST WHEN THEIR NAME IN FORCES FOLLOWED BY PRESCRIBED FIRE THE RISK OF FLAMES REACHING THE TOPS OF TREES OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CROWN FIRE. IS REDUCED. SECOND THE BENEFITS OF THINNING SERVICE ON LADDER FUELS IN FOREST LAST LONGER. WHEN FOLLOWED UP WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE. THIRD THEN IN A PRESCRIBED FIRE TOGETHER IS BROADLY EFFECTIVE IN MANY WESTERN FIRE ADAPTED FOR US AND AS A AS HAS BEEN TOUCHED ON EARLIER IS ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE FOREST FUELS. AND FINALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS RESEARCH APPLIES TO FIRE ADOPTED FOREST COMMUNITIES. OTHER HABITAT TYPES MAY REQUIRE ALTERNATIVE METHODS SUCH AS MECHANICAL RESTAURANT. REDUCTION AND THE CREATION OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE. DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING BENEFITS A PRESCRIBED FIRE AND RECENT INCREASES IN STATE FUNDING WE CONTINUE TO FALL VERY SHORT OF OUR PRESCRIBED FIRE ANNUAL ACREAGE TARGETS. MORE FUNDING WILL CERTAINLY HELP GET US TO SCALE BUT ONLY IF WE ADDRESS OTHER BARRIERS CURRENTLY LIMITING THE EXPANDED USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IS WORKING ON WITH ITS PARTNERS TO ADDRESS TWO SUCH PLAYERS THAT'LL COVER NEXT. AND THESE HAVE BEEN TOUCHED ON BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AS WELL. GROWING SKILLED WORKFORCE IN ADDITION TO PRESCRIBE OUR TRAININGS MENTIONED EARLIER THE NATURE CONSERVANCY'S CALIFORNIA OFFICE STRONGLY SUPPORTS. EFFORTS TO RAPIDLY EXPAND THE PRESCRIBED FIRE WORKFORCE A GREAT EXAMPLE IS OCCURRING THE TAHOE NATIONAL FOREST WE ARE WHERE WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO PLAN PRESCRIBED FIRE ACROSS SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED ACRES. OF FIRE PRONE FOREST AS PART OF THE FRENCH MEADOWS PROJECT IN THE AMERICAN RIVER WATERSHED. BY USING A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE FOREST SERVICE THE CONSERVANCY IS ABLE TO RAISE FUNDS FOR A VARIETY OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SOURCES. AND HIRE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS TO ADVANCE THE WORK. A KEY INGREDIENT TO OUR SUCCESS HAS BEEN A HIGH QUALITY WORKING RELATIONSHIPS. THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED A SKILL CONTRACTORS WHO LEAD OR BACKSTOPS. HE FUNCTIONS AND HE PRESCRIBED FIRE ROLES FOR EXAMPLE THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IS WORKING WITH FIRESTORM. A FULL SERVICE PRESCRIBE OUR CONTRACTOR WHO CAN DEPLOY HUNDREDS OF PRESCRIBED PARK REMEMBERS AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. THE SECOND LARGE BARRIER THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH THE STATE DIRECTLY IS TO ENSURE. THE BERMAN WINDOWS THAT ARE AVAILABLE CAN BE USED IN CAPITALIZE ON. TO ENSURE A PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECTS ARE SAFE WE WORK WITH EXPERIENCE FIRE PROFESSIONALS METEOROLOGIST AMERICA ALL THE REGULATORS. TO PRECISELY TIME ARE PERMITS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE BYRD WINDOWS. EFRAIN OWENS DON'T COOPERATE FOR A PARTICULAR PROJECT LOCATION FOR SAFETY SAKE WE MUST MAKE A NO GO DECISION. SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EXPEND PRECIOUS RESOURCES AND DELAY PROJECTS FOR YEARS. RECENTLY A NO GO DECISION IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOTIVATED THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND CAL. TO DEVELOP A NEW FORM OF FUNDING AGREEMENT THAT GIVES ARE PRESCRIBED FIRE TEAMS MORE OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY. BY DEFINING MULTIPLE ELIGIBLE FIRE LANDSCAPES INSTEAD OF JUST ONE PROJECT SITE. AND MONITORING FOR FAVORABLE BURN WINDOWS ACROSS ALL ELIGIBLE LANDSCAPE SIMULTANEOUSLY. WE ARE INCREASING OUR ODDS OF CAPTURING ONE OR MORE BURN WINDOWS DURING THE BURNING SEASON. WE THINK THAT THIS KIND OF FLEXIBLE FUNDING ARRANGEMENT WILL BE CRITICAL TO EXPAND INDIA'S FIRST PRIVATE HIRE IN THE FUTURE. SO IN SUMMARY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IS A LEADER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRESCRIBED FIRE SCIENCE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS NORTH AMERICA IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S OVERLY DENSE FORESTS WIDESPREAD INFRASTRUCTURE AND LARGE POPULATION CENTERS MAKE EXPANDING THE USE OF ECOLOGICAL FORESTRY AND PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND PRESCRIBED FIRE IN OUR FORCE CHALLENGING. BUT AMONG THE TOOLS AVAILABLE ECOLOGICAL THINNING PRESCRIBED FIRE ARE THE BEST HOPE WE HAVE FOR GETTING OUT OF OUR CURRENT BALLPARK PRICES. DO YOU DOES THAT AND THE NATURE CONSERVANCY INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS WORK WITH ITS PARTNERS. ON THREE FRONTS NUMBER ONE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR INCREASED FUNDING BOTH ON THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL FREE EAT PRESCRIBED PHARMACOLOGICAL FORESTRY. SECOND WE WILL REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO GROW A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE INCLUDING STATE FEDERAL. AND PRIVATE FIRE PROFESSIONALS AND THIRDS WILL DEVELOP NEW POLICIES AND PRACTICES CURRENTLY LIMITING PRESCRIBED FIRE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PORTER WILL COME BACK TO AFTER THE NEXT SPEAKER FOR QUESTIONS PRESHEAF THE A PRESENTATION. NEXT AND LAST WE HAVE SOME STUFF IN BIRD. WE CAN. MISTER BYRD ARE YOU THERE. I THINK THAT WE ARE TRYING TO REACH OUR WITNESS RIGHT NOW. I THINK THAT WHILE WE TRIED TO REACH HIM WHY DON'T WE SEE IF ANY. WHY DON'T WE BRING- THIS BACK TO THE PANEL TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. NOT RIGHT NOW. ARE WE THERE YET. HI IS THIS WE ARE NOT IN THE MALL MISTER BYRD ARE YOU THERE. YEAH ALL RIGHT HERE NOW SORRY ABOUT THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU OKAY WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU HAVE SEVEN MINUTES PLEASE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. EXCELLENT THANK YOU ALL TRY TO KEEP A GREAT BUT THANK THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY I APPRECIATE. ALL THE OPTIMISM AND HOPE FROM OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS- THAT IS GREAT AND- MISTER PORTER SET THAT UP VERY NICELY SO- BY PROFESSION I'VE BEEN A WILDLIFE BIOLOGIST MICHAEL DURING MY CAREER. AND BEEN HERE ON THESE LANDS FOR ABOUT TWENTY FOUR YEARS NOW- WE HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES THAT WE MANAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR NATIONAL FOREST. WHICH SITS RIGHT IN BETWEEN YOU SEVENTY NATIONAL PARK IN SEQUOIA KINGS CANYON NATIONAL PARK. AND WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED- UNEVEN AGE MANAGEMENT SINGLE TREE SELECTION WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CHAMBER AND WE HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED BURNING. FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS NOW. OUT WITH QUITE A SMALL STAFF AND- THOSE EFFORTS STARTED WITH THE POOREST YOUR NAME JOHN BOUT AND THEY HAVE JUST CONTINUED. WITH ALL OF US THAT ARE HERE TODAY. AND WE- RIGHT THE MID. OF THE CREEK FIRE SO ON FRIDAY NIGHT SEPTEMBER FOURTH THE CREEK FIRE STARTED. BY GATHERED A MORNING IT WAS. HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARDS OUR NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF OUR PROPERTY WE WERE DIRECTLY IN THE PATH OF THAT FIRE. AND ON SATURDAY THAT WAS SEPTEMBER FIFTH. THE FIRE WEATHER WAS JUST TERRIBLE THAT DAY IT WAS- QUITE HOT WE WERE EXPERIENCING SOME- DOWN CANYON WINDS ALL DAY SOME WHAT WE WOULD CALL A MOTOR WINDS DOWN SOUTH YOU CALLED SANTA ANA WINDS.THEY WORK SEVERE LIKE FANTA WINS BUT THEY WERE STILL WARM AND DRY AND THE FIRE BEHAVIOR THAT WE WERE WITNESSING THAT DAY WAS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY- IT WAS CONSUMING LAND AT A RAPID RATE- ULTIMATELY BECAME. MAYBE THE BIGGEST SINGLE FIRE OF THAT CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND WE ALSO MEASURED THE HIGHEST LOOP. IN THE HISTORY OF FIRESIDE I HEARD- OFFICIAL TELL ME THAT THEY MEASURE THIS WOMB AT FIFTY THOUSAND FEET IN ELEVATION AND YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET A MOVE LIKE THAT. WOULD YOU HAVE INTENSE FIRE BEHAVIOUR COUPLED. WITH THE- VERY YOUR LOOKING AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAD ON THE NASH FOREST ALL THE US FOR US. WE HAD CONDUCTED. PROBABLY FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS SOME PRESCRIBED BURNING AND SOME PILE BERNIE ALL ALONG THE NORTH BOUNDARY OF OUR PROPERTY AND SO WHEN THE CREEK FIRE ROARED UP OUT OF THE BIG CREEK CANYON. IT HIT OUR PROPERTY BOUNDARY AND JUST SAT RIGHT DOWN ON THE GROUND AND CAL FIRE WAS ABLE TO STOP IT THEY'RE REALLY ON A SINGLE LANE DIRT ROAD IN THE MIDDLE THE POOREST. PRETTY THEY COULDN'T STOP BACKFIRE ANYWHERE ELSE ON DAY ONE TWO AND THREE EXCEPT ON OUR LAND THAT FORCED IT TO ROTATE AROUND OUR LAND. WHICH GAVE YOU- CAL FIRE IN SOME OF OUR PERSONNEL ABOUT AN EXTRA TWENTY FOUR HOURS. TO PREPARE THE PALACE SHAVER LAKE. AND LIKE TOM MENTIONED EARLIER THERE WERE FIVE PROJECTS THAT WERE DONE IN FRESNO MADERA COUNTY THAT WERE ON THE GOVERNOR'S LEFT. AND SO REALLY IT THE FACT THAT WE STOPPED THAT BUYERS FORGET AROUND OUR PROPERTY ON DAY TWO. COUPLED WITH ALL THOSE YOUR BREAK PROJECT THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN AND AROUND OUR LANDS AND OTHER PRIVATE LANDS AROUND THE COUNTY SHAVER LAKE AND THEN JUST- A PRETTY HER WROTE EFFORT ON THE PART OF FIREFIGHTERS. IT WAS THE COMBIATION OF THOSE THREE THINGS. THAT REALLY STAYED THE COUNTY CHEVROLET ANY ONE OF THOSE THREE THINGS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE EQUATION I REALLY DOUBT THAT THE TOWNSHIP RELATED HERE TODAY. SO REALLY WE STAND HERE AS- I THINK A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE ESTIMATES. THAT YOU'LL MANAGEMENT. ARE PRESCRIBED BURNING ARE THESE KINDS OF PRACTICES. AND NAY LANDSCAPES. FROM REALLY AGGRESSIVE- WILDFIRES IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ENGAGE IN IN CALIFORNIA I APPRECIATE SO MANY THINK THAT SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT LIKE. WE HAVE TO USE EVERY TOOL THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TRY AND COMBAT THIS OP PROBLEM WE HAVE DUG A HOLE. FOR OURSELVES IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS WE'VE ALLOWED OUR WILD LANDSCAPES TO BECOME MORE AND. MORE DANCE AND WE'RE SEEING THESE BY. THAT WE WAITED BROKE EVERYTHING AT THEM AND YET WE COULD NOT IT THEM OR SLOW THE DOWN UNLESS WE'VE DONE. SOME THAT YOU MAY. IT GOING TO TAKE UP. A COUPLE DECADES YOU'RE SEE SOME- YOU REALLY NEED TO RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT BUT I HOPE THAT ALL OF US HERE IN CALIFORNIA CAN START MOVING OUR FORESTS AND OUR WILD LANDSCAPES. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. FOR US WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS JUST TRYING TO CREATE THE NUMBER OF TREES PER ACRE DOUBTS WILL MORE NATURAL MORE HISTORIC LEVEL. ON OUR LANDS WE PROBABLY HAD A HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TREES PER ACRE ON ADJACENT FEDERAL LANDS WE WERE LOOKING AT SIX SEVEN EIGHT HUNDRED TREES PER ACRE AND 60% OF THOSE TREES WERE DEBT. SO THERE WAS REALLY NO CHANCE- TO STOP THIS FIRE OUT IN OF COURSE LANDSCAPE. THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT THAT MORE THAN HALF DEBT. SO ANYWAY I COULD GO ON FOR HOURS WHAT I WOULD RATHER GET STOP RIGHT THERE AND ALLOW QUESTIONS TO BE- TALK TO THE PANEL AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO QUESTIONS I HAVE I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS I'LL KICK IT OFF- FIRST FOR MISTER TRIP IF WE CAN BRING HIM BACK UP PERHAPS IN THE VIDEO- AND MAYBE- MAYBE MR PORTER ALSO ONCE TRIED TO ANSWER THIS WHICH IS. I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH OF THE STATE TRADITIONALLY HAD CULTURAL BURNS WAS THAT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- OR CERTAIN REGIONS ONLY. AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE GOING BACK THE STATE WAS A LOT LESS POPULATED THAN IT IS NOW AND I'M WONDERING WHETHER THERE WERE. IT WOULD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF ACRES A YEAR THOUSANDS OF ACRES A YEAR YOU KNOW WHAT WERE THE TRADITIONAL CULTURAL BURN PATTERNS WITH THAT OF LOOKED LIKE A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO. GOOD QUESTION- HI I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE STATE. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT INDIGENOUS CULTURES- ORIGINATING- THROUGHOUT- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN OUR AREA I'M IN A IN THE NORTHWESTERN CORNER OF THE STATE- WE LIVED IN PERMANENT HOUSES MADE OUT OF SPLIT PORT ORFORD CEDAR PLANKS. SO WE LIVE IN PERMANENT WOODEN STRUCTURES- MY MUCH LIKE WE DO TODAY AND WE EMPLOYED FIRE A VAST SCALE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. VERY INTENSIVELY WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MILES LIKE I SPOKE TO EARLIER. BUT ALSO ALONG THE STRATEGIC RIDGELINES WHERE WE WOULD BE DEPENDING ON ON. HUNTING FOR LARGE GAME AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO THE ALSO WE HAD CEREMONIAL BURNING PRACTICES THAT OCCURRED IN THE SAME PLACE- EVERY YEAR- THAT WERE LANDSCAPE. SCALE WERE YOU KNOW ONE NOW RIGHT INDICATOR SHOWED ITSELF- FIRES WOULD BE LET AND THEY WOULD BURN. FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. OUR AREA BEING SURROUNDED BY MULTIPLE WILDERNESS AREAS IS. IS THE TYPE OF PLACE WHERE A PERSON COULD PROBABLY- REINSTATE A LOT OF THIS TRADITIONAL TIMING- DUE TO THE FACT THAT IS ONLY TWO PERCENT- DEVELOPED AND MOST OF THAT BEING DOWN IN THE RIVER CORRIDOR LIKE WE WERE TRADITIONALLY- HOWEVER. IN OTHER AREAS YOU KNOW ITS THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT- DEFINITELY- CREATES CHALLENGES WHERE'S IF PERHAPS MAYBE THE INDIGENOUS CULTURE WAS MORE OF A NOMADIC IN NATURE- PERHAPS DEPENDING ON THE SEASONALITY OF THE USE OF THE RESOURCES EMPLOYED IN A GIVEN AREA- MAYBE THE PEOPLE OF THE POLICE WOULD LIKE TO FIRE ON THEIR WAY OUT. AND WALK AWAY FOR THE SEASON. THAT BEHAVING THAT WAY WOULD BE DIFFICULT TODAY IF THERE'S A TOWN BUILT THEIR BUT YOU KNOW EMPLOYING SO MORE FOCUSED- PRESCRIBED FIRE- PRACTICES- YOU KNOW WITH SOME OF THE TOOLS WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE LIKE FIRE ENGINES. AND THINGS LIKE THAT. MEANS THAT WE STILL COULD EMPLOY SOME BURNING- TWO CHIEFS OF SIMILAR OBJECTIVES AND PROTECT HOMES M. IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL IT WOULD JUST HAVE TO BE- MUCH MORE PLANNED- AND CARRIED OUT. A LOT MORE STRATEGICALLY. RIGHT. I'M SORRY I DID UP MY MICROPHONE ON SO I'M ASSUMING THAT THE BURNS OF CULTURAL BRANDS WERE MOSTLY HAPPENING RIGHT AROUND A NEAR WHERE PEOPLE WERE LIVING AND THEN AND FURTHER DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS IT WOULD BE ONLY A LIGHTNING STRIKE THAT SORT OF EVENT SO THERE MIGHT BE PARTS THAT THE FORCE THAT ONE WERE AND BURNING. TO MUCH. I'M I'M WONDERING. YOU MENTIONED A FEW OF THE WAYS THAT WE COULD HELP REMOVE SOME OF THE VERY BARRIERS THAT YOU FACE ARE THERE OTHER WAYS THAT THE STATE COULD BE A PARTNER WITH YOU AND OTHER TRIBES IN THE CULTURAL BURNS. YES YEAH I WOULD GO AHEAD AND CLARIFY THAT FURTHER OUT IN THE WILDERNESS- BURNING WAS OCCURRING- IT JUST MOSTLY WAS STRATEGIC IN NATURE SO THE WITH LIGHTNING MISSIONS WOULD BE CONFINED TO SMALLER AREAS BUMPING UP AGAINST RECENT OUR FOOTPRINTS. ALONG THE RIDGE SYSTEMS. A WORD WORD LIGHTNING GENERAL STRIKES- BUT- AND WE HAVE A LOT A LOT OF INSTANCES WHERE WHERE THAT IS HELD IN OUR ORAL- KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION. BUT THERE WHEN IT COMES TO PARTNERING WITH THE STATE TO OVERCOME BARRIERS THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS WE CAN DO THAT- WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH MAGUIRE'S OFFICE- ABOUT- DEVELOPING A FUNDING SOURCE- STARTING AT ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR- TO. TO BE ABLE TO WORK TO PARTNER WITH TRIBES I'M MORE OF A NEGOTIATED BASIS ON A SOVEREIGN TO SOVEREIGN LEVEL- TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME WAYS- TO ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER- AS SOVEREIGNS TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE- AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT. YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME STRENGTHS YOU KNOW I SPOKE A LOT TO USING STRENGTH TO OVERCOME WEAKNESSES- THERE ARE SOME STRINGS TO THINGS LIKE TO TRAVEL AUTHORITY RULE- IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT- TO WHERE TRIBES CAN ACTUALLY DEVELOP THEIR OWN PLANS TO MAGIC MANAGER QUALITY. IF EVERYONE CAN AGREE TO IT THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW THERE'S THE WESTERN REGIONAL AIR PARTNERSHIP PUBLISHED SOME GUIDANCE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. OR TWO THAN FIVE AROUND THE- REGIONAL HAZE RULE DISCUSSING A PATHWAY FOR CAT CLASSIFYING- NATURAL VERSES ANTIGENIC COMMISSION SOURCES AND THEY FOUND PATHWAYS TO IDENTIFY. ULTRA BURNING AS PART OF THE NATURAL BACKGROUND IN A NATURAL EMISSIONS SOURCE YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES WE INTERPRET WELL IT'S NOT ALWAYS A LAWLER POLICY THAT BECOMES A BARRIER BUT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IN THE CREATION OF THE POLICY THAT BECOMES A BARRIER. AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE WAY WE VIEW FAR TODAY WE LOOK AT THE IGNITION AS THE CAUSE OR THE EMISSIONS SOURCE HE MAY BE IN A HUMAN OR AN ANTHROPOGENIC IGNITION. BUT IT'S A FUEL ACCUMULATION THAT ACTUALLY IS CREATES THE LEVEL OF IMPACT RELATED TO THE MISSION ITSELF. AND SO IN IN THAT ASPECT. ONE COULD BEGIN TO INTERPRET CULTURE BURNING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE AS A NATURAL EMISSIONS SOURCE BECAUSE IT IS THE FUEL ITSELF AND SPENT THE THAT IS A MEETING THE CRITERIA POLLUTANT NOT THE FACT THAT SOMEONE WOULD. THAT SAID YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE ARE A LOT MORE- OF THOSE TYPES OF EXAMPLES OUT THERE WITH WITH DIFFERENT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE LETTER HOLDING US UP TODAY- YOU KNOW THERE'S SO. TRADE STRUCTURE TEXAN TRADES THAT TAKE PLACE BETWEEN- THE BA AND KALIFORNIA FOR SERVICE WILL TRIBES CAN COMPACT THAT RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE FIT FROM THE VA IF WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF TRAINING AND QUALIFICATION AND BASELINE LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT POSITIONS SO IF WE CAN MEET SOME OF THOSE STANDARDS AND CRITERIA. WE CAN THEN BECOME. ANOTHER PARTY TO THOSE AGREEMENTS AND ACTUALLY- TRADE DIRECT PROTECTION AREAS AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW. THE FOR SERVICE ISSUES CAL FIRE PERMITS THROUGH THOSE AGREEMENTS AND TRIBES CAN DO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS TOO AND SO I'M SURE EACH TRIBE. MAY WANT TO DO THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY- BUT THAT SAYS THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT COULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER. IF WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND- CULTURAL BURNING IN CALIFORNIA DO YOU FEEL THAT. SORT OF THE KNOWLEDGE BASES THERE WITHIN THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY- OR DO YOU THINK THAT BEFORE WE DID THAT WE'D HAVE TO. KIND OF DO SOME PREPARATION IN SOME PLACES. FROM THE KNOWLEDGE BASE IS PRESIDENT IN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO FIND THE PERSON TOOK TO PULL IT PULL IT OUT OF OR THE ORGANIZATION- TO BE- TAKING THE POINT OF THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY WANTING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN ARE ARE REALLY LETTING THEMSELVES KNOWN AND THERE ARE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OUT THERE. I THINK THAT ARE READY TO BEGIN TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THIS CAN BE DONE I'VE BEEN ACTUALLY- TALKING WITH SOME FOLKS THAT MAY BE ABLE TO HELP WITH SOME OF THIS- SPECIFICALLY AROUND- THE UC SYSTEM. AND I'VE LEARNED TO THAT THE UC SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY A COMPONENT OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE CONSTITUTION. I HAVEN'T RESEARCH- THAT VERY VERY DEEPLY YET BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME COMMON INTERESTS. I'M AROUND- THE AGRICULTURAL MECHANICAL ARTS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES- THE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ENGAGE IN IN THE BLENDING OF. OF OUR INDIGENOUS AND WESTERN SCIENCES- TO OVERCOME OUR CURRENT OBSTACLES. THERE'S A PATHWAY THERE MAY NOT EVEN TAKE ANY LEGISLATIVE- FUNDING ANY NEW MONEY YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS- IN THE UC SYSTEM ABOUT SOME OF ITS POTENTIAL AND HAVE BEEN HIT THERE'S BEEN SOME INDICATION. THAT YOU KNOW IF THE ENABLING CONDITIONS WERE SET UP. AND A BROAD LEVEL OF SUPPORT FROM THE TRIBAL. CONSTITUENCY CAME FORWARD TO SAY- YES WE WOULD LIKE TO DO- TAKE 1% OF- THE REVENUE GENERATED BY THE UC ENDOWMENT. AND INVEST IT IN IN THE ACTIVITIES WERE SPEAKING OF RIGHT NOW IN IN IN THREE OR FOUR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES- TWO PILOTS SOME OF THESE THINGS. THEN THEN YOU KNOW THAT COULD THAT COULD SET UP- SOME PERMANENT FUNDING BASIS- IN AND- FOR SOME OF THESE PLACE BASED SOLUTIONS. SOME FAIRLY QUICKLY IT SOUNDS LIKE IT DOESN'T EVEN TAKE A LEGISLATIVE ACTION FOR UC SYSTEM TO MAKE A DECISION IN THAT CONTEXT BUT WHEN YOU DID READ THE MORAL ACT THAT CREATED THE LAND. THE. THE SYSTEMS OF THE LAND. I CAN'T MEMBER TAKE ON THE LAND BASED UNIVERSITIES AND- IT SAYS THAT. THAT IT'S UP TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND SO IT MAY ONLY TAKE AS MUCH AS SOME ENCOURAGEMENT BY THE ROAD LEGISLATURE OR MAYBE EVEN AN AUTHORITY TO DONATE TO A TRIBALLY DRIVEN ENDOWMENT FUND OF FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN THE MECHANIC THEIR CULTURAL MECHANICAL ARTS- TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE IN GETTING US THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GOING TO MOVE ON- TO MARGOT TO ASK A QUESTION SHE STILL THERE- WHICH IS A SIMILAR QUESTION ABOUT WE USE THAT YOU THINK THE STATE COULD PARTNER- WITH YOUR TRIBE OF A BIT BETTER TO. TO EXPAND TO OTHER CULTURAL BRANDS BOTH WITH YOU IN OTHER COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE SOME SOME BARRIERS REGARDING PERMITTING AND THE YUROK TRIBE ACTUALLY HAS AND- IN AIR AIR QUALITY DIVISION. AND ONE WE DO BURNSWE'RE ACTUALLY GET A PERMIT FROM THE TRIBE AS WELL AS THE NORTH COAST AIR QUALITY. AND SO THE TRIBE IS SET UP TO- TO FULLY. BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AIR QUALITY PARK AND SO THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE ONE THING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THEM TO TAKE THAT OVER THE OTHER THING THAT- SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE SINCE THE SEQUEL A PROCESS. THAT WHEN TRIBES ARE BURNING ON THEIR OWN LAND BASE THEY SHOULD BE THE ONES TO BE GIVEN THE APPROVAL FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. THE ARE THE EXPERTS IN THAT AREA SO WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THE STATE TO ARM TO CONSIDER TURNING THAT RESPONSIBILITY- OVER TWO TRIBES AND IF IT IS- AND MORE THAN LIKELY WOULD WOULD- ARE. BE A GOOD SUM OF MONEY TO- TO ASSUME THAT RESPONSIBILITY WITH TURNING THAT OVER WOULD ALSO COME SOME DOLLARS- I AM A YUROK TRIBAL MEMBER BUT I'M NOT PART OF THE FORMAL TRIBAL STRUCTURE. THE CULTURAL PRIOR MANAGEMENT COUNCIL IS A NON PROFIT AND SO I CAN'T LIKE REALLY SPEAK FOR THE TRIBE BUT AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WORKS WITH FIRE ON THE RESERVATION THOSE TWO THINGS ARE WHAT COME TO MIND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE INPUT FROM I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR- DAN PORTER PORTER. DAN ARE YOU THERE. SO YOU DAM. I THINK I'M HERE NOW OKAY GREAT HELLO WELCOME THANK YOU MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS WHAT ARE THE ECOLOGICAL COAL BENEFITS A PRESCRIBED FIRE AND IF THERE'S A WAY THAT THE STATE COULD SOMEHOW BETTER VALUE WERE QUANTIFIED. THOSE BENEFITS. GREAT QUESTION SO- THERE ARE SO MANY ECOLOGICAL GO BENEFITS OF PRESCRIBED FIRE- THE FIRST ONE THAT COMES TO MIND. IS THE RECYCLING OF NUTRIENTS BACK INTO THE FOREST FLOOR- MUCH OF CALIFORNIA'S A FOREST HAVE BEEN CUT OVER AND SOME OF THE SOILS HAVE WASHED AWAY AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. RECOVERY THAT TAKES- DECADES- AT TIMES DEPENDING ON THE SITE- PRESCRIBED FIRE ACHIEVES TWO THINGS AT ONCE IT REMOVES THE SURFACE AND WATER FUELS AND RECYCLE THOSE NUTRIENTS RIGHT BACK INTO THE SOIL- BENEFITTING THE SMALL THINGS THAT REALLY. AREN'T RUN- NATURE- ANOTHER BIG HOPE BENEFIT OF COURSE IS A CARBON SEQUESTRATION- THAT MAY BE THOUGHT OF AS MOSTLY AS A HUMAN BENEFIT WHICH IT IS FOR CLIMATE MITIGATION- BUT IT'S ALSO- AND ECOLOGICAL BENEFIT IN THAT- THE SIERRA FORESTS IN THE FOREST IN THE REDWOOD RANGE. ARE SOME OF THE MOST CARBON DENSE FORESTS ON THE PLANET- IN THEIR OLD GROWTH FORESTS- AND GET FIRED UP FOR US THAT MEANS IN THEIR FIRE RESILIENT FORM. SO WHAT WE ARE. TALKING ABOUT RECREATING IS- BY DOING THE THINGS RECOMMENDED HERE TODAY IS ONE OF THE LARGEST- TERRESTRIAL CARBON RESERVOIRS- ON THE PLANET THAT IS FAR RESILIENCE AND SUPPORTS A HIGH DEGREE OF BIODIVERSITY. WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER AND MY LAST QUESTION IS ACTUALLY FOR STEVEN. ARE YOU STILL THERE. YEP I'M HEREGREAT MY QUESTION IS WHETHER AS SIENESE GOING TO EXPAND THE USE OF FIRE ON ITS LANDS AFTER SHAVER LAKE IF YOU'RE IF THAT'S CHANGE YOUR GOALS OR YOUR OPERATIONS AT ALL THAT EXPERIENCE. I HELP HELP THE CREEK FIRE- CHANGED OUR GOAL ON OUR LAND THAT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHANGING ANY OF YOUR PROGRAM TO INCREASE PRESCRIBED FIRE OR CHANGE HOW YOU DO IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WELL IF ANYTHING IT WOULD MOTIVATE US TO. INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DEBT MANAGEMENT AND- THE AMOUNT OF PRESCRIBED BURNING THAT WE DO ON OUR LANDS- IN YEARS PAST WE HAVE HAD A GOAL OF TRYING TO GET. ABOUT A THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR ON OUR TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. TWO THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR BUT- A VARIETY OF THINGS AND READ MAINLY REGULATIONS- SLOW THAT DOWN AND KEEP US FROM ACHIEVING THAT BUT WE HAVE- CREATED A VERY GOOD PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL FIRE DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS. AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HELP BUT- AT TIMES THEY COME ON OUR LAND. WILL BURN TOGETHER THEY'LL BURN ONE UNIT- MY STAFF WILL BURN ANOTHER UNIT AND SO I THINK THAT'S GONNA ALLOW US TO RAMP UP- THE AMOUNT OF ACREAGE THAT WE CONDUCT PRESCRIBED BURNS ON. GENERALLY SPEAKING THOUGH NO WE WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO RESTORE OUR POOREST. BACK TO A NATURAL HISTORIC LOOKING AND HISTORIC FUNCTIONING. WORKING FOR IT. AND SO THAT'S STILL GOING TO BE OUR GOAL- WILL BE WILL BE DOING A LITTLE BIT MORE PLANTING IN SOME AREAS- WHERE THE FIRE WHAT IF YOUR OWNER PROPERTY WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED ACRES. THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME REHAB WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ACRES- ON OUR PROPERTY WITH A FIRE WALKED ONTO OUR PROPERTY BUT ACTUALLY DID A VERY GOOD JOB THAT PRESCRIBED BURNING. SOME OF OUR LAND AGAIN I ACTUALLY FELT KIND OF GUILTY- PROBABLY DAY FOR THE FIRE LOOKING ON THE EAST SIDE OF OUR PROPERTY. THANK YOU WHILE THIS BUYERS ACTUALLY DOING A PRETTY GOOD. UNDER BIRDS ON SOME OF OUR LAND HERE WHILE IT WAS WREAKING HAVOC AND DESTRUCTION IN OTHER PLACES SO. OUR GOALS HAVE NOT CHANGED- WE HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO RE INTRODUCE FIRE. BACK. INTO THE SYSTEM. I BERNIE. WHICH IS JUST MEN. NAT HIS FOR. IS THE NUMBER ONE PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE. AGAINST CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING IN MAPS ALL OVER THE STATE- NOT ONLY DOES IT IMPROVE WATER QUALITY BUT IT INCREASES WATER QUANTITY. GOING DOWNSTREAM WOULD YOU HAVE TO PROPERLY MANAGE. OKAY HAVE THANK YOU I THINK WE ARE YOUR NUMBERS TO TREAT THE PROPER LEVELS. OKAY THANKS NO THAT'S FINE THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER I'M GOING TO MOVE NOW TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. I'M GONNA GO TO THE DOCTOR WOULD. LOOK YES SOME- I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE FOR DAN AND THEN ALSO WON FOR- MISTER TRIP FROM. OUR KERR CORRECT REPRESENTATIVE SO- WHOEVER'S AVAILABLE. THE. OKAY OKAY MR TRIPP HI PRECIADO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND- JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU- FOR YOU HOW DO YOU COMPARE AND CONTRAST HOW THE TRIBE'S RELATIONSHIP. WITH REGARDING FIRED PRESCRIBED FIRE CULTURAL BURNING RECALL CULTURAL BURNING WITH THE IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE COOPERATION YOU GET FOR YOUR FREE FOR THE WORK YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. YES THERE IS- WE'VE WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES WORKING WITH TO STAY IN RECENT YEARS. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN BURNING- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL PRESCRIBED FIRE COUNCIL'S AND- FIRE SAFE COUNCILS OF FOR THE HIM BETTER PART OF A COUPLE DECADES NOW ON VERY SMALL SCALES. MMHM BUT YOU KNOW RECENTLY WITH OUR KAMATH RIVER OF PRESCRIBED FIRE TRAINING EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES. MMHM WE'VE REALLY SCALED UP. THAT ACTIVITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE- WE STILL ARE TO THAT POINT TO WHERE- WE'RE GETTING ANY MEANINGFUL OF BURNING DONE ON THE FOR SERVICE SIDE OF THE LINE- WE STILL DON'T HAVE. ANY SIGN BURN PLANTS FROM THE VA. AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE TROUBLED TRUST PARCELS AND THE NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM LANDS- WE'RE JUST NOT GETTING THERE. WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF PRE TREATMENT DONE. ON THOSE LANDS WE'RE WE'RE GETTING MAKE A LOT OF PILES. WERE EVEN CHALLENGE BURNING THOSE FILES- BUT- AND WHEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEND SOME SOME TREES- YOU KNOW THAT THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BECOME THE PRIORITY. BUT YOU KNOW THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR IN THE TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS CLEAR IT NEEDS TO BE ABOUT GETTING THE FIRE ON THE GROUND EVEN WHEN YOU DO THOSE THINGS OR OR YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE. GREAT WELL THANK YOU AND I AND I AND I DID HEAR ALSO THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE HAVING IS A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO PUSH FOR THESE ACTIVITIES SENSE. THAT THAT'S CORRECT. YES WE'VE BEEN YOU KNOW LUCKY ENOUGH TO. TO RECEIVE SOME THREE YEAR GRANTS- TO BUILD SOME CAPACITY- BUT- THOSE THREE YEAR GRANTS- ARE COMING TO THEIR HAND- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF LOSING A LOT OF OUR- OUR BILL TO PASS CITY IN. AND SO WERE WERE YOU KNOW OF COURSE IN THE SHORT TERM GONNA GONNA TRY TO TRY TO- SUSTAIN WHAT WE CAN. BY SUBMITTING SOME RATS BUT ULTIMATELY- THESE THINGS KIND OF KIND OF NEED TO HAVE SUSTAINABLE SOURCES- BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T MAINTAIN THEM YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT IS JUST A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. THANK YOU AND HOW HOW MANY ACRES ALTOGETHER- ARE CONSIDERED COULD PROVE. HOW TRIBAL LAND RIGHT NOW. ROUGHLY HOME I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT IT OCCURRED TO US THAT ARE CONSIDERED GROUP TRIBAL LAND IT'S YOU KNOW IN THE LOW THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS TWO THOUSAND. BUT AND IS SPREAD ACROSS YOU KNOW. MILLIONS OF ACRES AND SO- THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GETTING TO THE POINT OF TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY IN RECOGNIZING TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY IS BECAUSE OUR CONSTITUTION- THAT-ESTABLISHES OUR TRIBAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS. SOME SHOWS THAT ARE JURISDICTION- OVER US SUCH THINGS SUCH AS ECOLOGICAL PROCESS AND FUNCTION. SOME ARE HARD TO FIND TO BE APPLICABLE AT THE TERRITORIAL SCALE AND SO WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT HAVING AN OVERLAPPING JURISDICTION BASED ON OUR CONSTITUTION SAYS AND THAT'S THE SKILL WE OPERATE UNDER- WITH OUR DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S RESOURCES OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU. AND THEN I HAVE A QUESTION FOR DAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YES- THIS IS- ACTUALLY- MAYBE TALK QUESTION MAYBE ON A QUESTION STATEMENT YOU KNOW BACK AND FORTH ON THIS SO- APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT YOU'RE CREATING WITH YOUR- YOUR BERMAN YOUR PRESCRIBER AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- NOBODY HAS HIT UPON THAT- I'VE MET EXPERIENCE WITH THE- MY- FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY NOW SENATOR DOLLY- VISITING. HIS HIS- DISTRICT- IT COUPLE OF TIMES ACTUALLY ON ON TRIPS OUT INTO THE FOREST. THE VALUE TO OUR WATERSHEDS OF THESE PRESCRIBED BURNS OVER THE LONG HAUL AND BY THAT I MEAN. COMBINED WITH THE PRETREATMENT OF THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND THEN THE PRESCRIBED BURN. ALL THAT VEGETATION THAT IS OVERGROWN THOSE INDIVIDUAL STRAWS IN THE GROUND. THE FACT THEY ALL DRAW WATER. AND THEY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF WATERSHEDS TO BE HEALTHY- IS YOU KNOW IT NATURE CONSERVANCY OBVIOUSLY HUGELY RESPECTED AND BY ME AND SO MANY OTHERS- IS THERE BEEN HAVE YOU DONE RESEARCH INTO. THE VALUE OF THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ON ON WATER SUPPLY AND WATERSHED HEALTH. WE HAVE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO I THINK IT WAS- YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENT. IT DOES IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK RELEVANT HERE I DOLLARS AND PREVENTION- TO GET A GREAT TO SIX DOLLARS- AND AVOIDED COSTS WITH RESPECT TO- WHILE FIREFIGHTING AND RECOVERY- EFFORTS AND- THAT. THAT IDEA IS EMBODIED IN A STUDY THAT WE COMPLETED SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH SOME PARTNERS CALLED THE COLONY OF WAITED COST STUDY- WHERE. A SERIES OF AUTHORS QUANTIFIED- THE AVOIDED COSTS OF. HOW HIGH INTENSITY WILDFIRES- BY VIRTUE OF THE PREVENTATIVE WORK THAT THAT COULD BE DONE. TO THE QUESTION OF- WATER BENEFITS IN A NUMBER OF- STUDIES- DONE ALONG THOSE LINES SOME BY US. A LEADER IN THIS FIELD IS YOU SEE SAID THE WORK OF DR ROGER BALES- WHO IS PART OF OUR FRENCH MEADOWS PARTNERSHIP- THE WATER CYCLE ITSELF IS COMPLICATED ARE PREDICTING WATER YIELD IN RELATION TO FOREST MANAGEMENT EVEN MORE SO. THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME. DOMINO GAINES AND WATER YIELD ASSOCIATED WITH- ANY BUT I THINK FURTHER STUDY IS NEEDED- AND I'D I'D REFER YOU TO DR BAILES WORK AND OTHER HYDROLOGISTS WHO ARE FAR MORE QUALIFIED THAN I AM- BUT CERTAINLY- THE WATERSHED BENEFITS OVERALL. IN TERMS OF AVOIDING- HIGH INTENSITY WILDFIRES THAT RESULT IN A HIGHLY RUNNABLE SOILS. CLOGGING UP RESERVOIRS FOR YEARS AND ADDING TO THEIR ANNUAL MAINTENANCE COSTS- ALONG WITH IMPACTS TO THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES LIKE- VERY SOME FABIAN SPECIES THE RELYING CLEAN COLD WATER- ALL ADD UP. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FLOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ACTUALLY MISTER PORTER I HAD A QUESTION FOR YOU AS WELL AS I SEE YOUR CHAIR SPENDING I DIDN'T CATCH YOU QUICK ENOUGH. THAT'S FINE I'M BACK. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE EVERY YEAR UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO THE CQC VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PLAN HOW CAN- STATE AGENCIES AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE HANG UPS WITH STATED SHE'S ON PARTNERING WITH UTILITIES TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS TO MAKE- MAKE IT A PRIORITY ON STATE LANDS. CAN YOU CLARIFY STATE LANDS WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING SPECIFICALLY PRIVATE PLANS OR- THOSE WITHIN COUNTY JURISDICTION. CERTAINLY NOT PRIVATE I THINK BY BILLIONS AS ITS OWN SEPARATE YOU KNOW ISSUE BUT WAS FAR AS LIKE THE STATE RESPONSE AREA- AS IT RUNS INTO YOU KNOW- LOCALIZED URBAN INTERFACE BUT STATE RESPONSE HERE IT PRIMARILY. OKAY SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TOUCHING ON IS- THE IDEA AND THE NEED AT THE END IT'S A BIG NEED FOR- CROSS JURISDICTIONAL- PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION WOULD THAT BE CORRECT. CERTAINLY YES BUT IT IS. WHEN YOU APPLY FOR A PERMIT SAY WHETHER IT'S WHATEVER UTILITY THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING. THERE TENDS TO BE A HANG UP WITH STATE AGENCIES ON THOSE PERMITTING BECAUSE THEY GO THROUGH MULTIPLE AGENCIES MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND BY THE TIME THAT WE GET ALL OF THIS DONE. WERE EITHER OUT OF THE SEASON OR I MEAN WE FOR THE TRIBAL MEMBERS TALK ABOUT IT WE JUST RAN OUT OF TIME TO DO THIS SO IS THERE A WAY IN YOUR MIND WE COULD STREAMLINE SOME OF THAT SO WHEN UTILITIES OR TRIBE IS WANTING TO DO THESE THINGS- TILE SEQUENCE INCHES IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. WHAT CAN WE DO TO STREAMLINE THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL WITHIN THE STATE AGENCIES. OKAY GOT IT SO I THINK THAT. EXEMPTIONS ARE IN AND OF THEMSELVES- BUT IT TOOL IN SOME SITUATIONS- YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT WITH SB NINE A ONE- IF A FUELS MANAGEMENT- ACTIVITY IS ALREADY COVERED BY NEPA ON FEDERAL LANDS NATIONAL FIREMEN ALL POLICY ACT THEN- THOSE SAME PROJECTS CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS EXEMPTED FROM SEQUEL HAVING ALREADY GONE THROUGH AN ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION FOR THE FEDERAL PROCESS SO. THAT THOSE KIND OF EXEMPTIONS WORK WELL WHEREVER YOU'RE- TAKING A LOOK AT AND REMOVING- REDUNDANCIES IN THE SYSTEM- I THINK YOU KNOW TO DIRECTOR PORTERS- PREVIOUS COMMENT. IT THEY'RE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT NEED TO BE KNOWN IT AND DISCLOSED- BEFORE ASSERTING THAT THERE IS NO HARM- CERTAINLY THERE ARE WAYS ON THE GROUND THAT CAN BE. USED TO MAKE THAT PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT- BUT I THINK FRANKLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS FORMING THOSE CROSS JURISDICTIONAL PARTNERSHIPS- WE HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL ONE FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE PLASTER COUNTY WATER AGENCY. PLASTER COUNTY THE US FOREST SERVICE KALIFORNIA SEVERAL OTHER PARTNERS WHERE WE SIT DOWN AHEAD OF TIME DEFINE OUR GOALS. RAISE FUNDS FOR THOSE GOALS. SHEPHERDED FIREMAN ALL PERMITTING. AWESOME SO THAT WERE FULLY AWARE OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE- IN TERMS OF NATURAL CULTURE RESOURCE OUT THERE- AS WE GET INTO FUNDING PROJECTS AND BY DOING THAT WE END UP AVOIDING UP MOST NOT ALL BUT MOST OF THE DELAYS THAT THAT- FOLKS EXPERIENCE BUT IT IS A VERY RESOURCE INTENSIVE PROCESS. NO ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE I THINK I MEAN IN THIS ENTIRE HEARING TODAY WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THE IMPORTANCE OF USING. FIRE AS A TOOL TO RESTRICT USE OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AS YOU WELL KNOW YOU KNOW THERE'S THREE THINGS TO SUSTAIN FIRE IT OXYGEN FUEL AND IGNITION RIGHT. THE ONLY THING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS REDUCING THE FUEL LOAD AND FIRE IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. AND I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE USE OUR TRIBAL FRIENDS- TO GET THIS THING MOVING FORWARD. BUT IF IT IS GOOD ON TRIBAL LAND. IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE FOR SYSTEM. AND SO I THINK IT'S WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS. HOW DO WE ALLOW PRIVATE INDUSTRIES PRIVATE ENTITIES. TO USE THE SAME. HELLO THE SAME. METHODS THAT ARE GOOD ON TRIBAL LANDS BUT CAN READ REDUCE SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS BECAUSE I FIND THAT WE GET HUNG UP- AT THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS THEIR JURISDICTIONS. AND NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO LIKE LET THE OTHER GUYS HANNAH COOKIE JAR RIGHT WE ALL CAN WERE VERY TERRITORIAL OF THAT. AND SO THAT IS MY FEAR IS WHERE WE ARE IDENTIFYINGTHAT THIS IS A GREAT TOOL. HOW DO WE USE IT IN TRIBAL LANDS TO BE SHORT AS WELL AS YOU KNOW MAYBE MORE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC STATE LANDS AS WELL. SO THAT'S KIND OF. MY CONCERN WITH ALL THIS. YEAH I KNOW IT'S A- COULD. AND I THINK TO THE DEGREE THAT CAN THIS WON'T BE A SIMPLE SOLUTION BUT I THINK CENTRALIZING- THE PLAN IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS STAYS- AS MUCH AS THEY CAN OR AT LEAST COORDINATING THEM WOULD BE. HELPFUL ONE ONE GROUP THAT I. MENTIONED IN MY PREVIOUS ANSWER IS. IT ARE THAT THEY ARE DISTRICTS AND CAPITOLA- THEY'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE PARTNERS. IN OUR IN OUR COLLABORATIVE AS WELL- AND SO IF YOU CAN TAKE THOSE FLEDGLING EFFORTS WHETHER IT BE BY THE TRIBES OR BY THE NGO COMMUNITY. AND SEE WHAT WORKS WITHIN THOSE COLLABORATIVES- I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE THE INGREDIENTS FOR YOU KNOW SOME BROADER SYSTEMATIC CHANGE THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE IN MIND. PERJURY MUCH THANK YOU. ABOUT THANK YOU I'M ARE THEY ANY. FROM ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY I'M NOT HEARING ANY I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE WITNESSES FROM ALL OF THE PANELS WERE REALLY REALLY. IMPORTANT I'M HEARING A LOT OF WONDERFUL INFORMATION AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO TESTIMONY FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE IN THE ROOM. AND I WILL JUST GIVE NOTICE TO THE UP TELEPHONE OPERATOR THAT AFTER THIS WILL BE MOVING TO- THE TELEPHONE- COMMENTARY SO YOU MAY WANT TO START QUEUING UP TO THOSE WITNESSES. AND THEY WILL BE TWO MINUTES I REPEAT TWO MINUTES ONLY PER INDIVIDUAL PER SPEAKER PLEASE. A MAP IS IT ON YES WE CAN ARE YOU ME THANK YOU MATT CHAIR MEMBER CHRIS MY KALEY I BEHALF OF THE HUMBLE AND THEN MENDOZA REDWOOD COMPANY WE HAD WITH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE. PROVIDED THIS AFTERNOON BY YOUR DIFFERENT PANELISTS IN PARTICULAR OUR FIRM BELIEF IS THAT WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE WE REALLY HAVE TO ADDRESS BOTH. IMITATION ON LIABILITY. ABSENT OF COURSE SOME SORT OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE. IN ORDER TO ALLOW THOSE TO BE INSURABLE ACTIONS WITHOUT INSURANCE WITHOUT SOME SORT OF LIMITATION ON LIABILITY WE'RE NOT GONNA GET PRESCRIBED FIRE TO SCALE. WE ALSO OF COURSE NEED TO CONTINUE THINNING EFFORTS BUT THERE ARE TWO OTHER ITEMS I WANT TO BRING TO THE- COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION MADAM CHAIR FIRST IS WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE ONE INDIVIDUAL IN CHARGE- DIRECTING THESE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS WITH THE GOAL OF. A HALF A MILLION ACRES A YEAR TO TREAT AND OVER THIRTY THREE MILLION- FOREST LANDS ACRES OF FOREST LAND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL IN CHARGE THE OTHER THING IS WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THAT MATERIAL- WE THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT TO INVOLVE BIOMASS. YOU BASICALLY HAVE TWO OPTIONS IF YOU'RE GOING TO TREAT THAT SORT OF A LARGE SCALE NUMBER OF ACRES EITHER UP OPEN PILE BURNS FOR BIOMASS AND IF YOU BELIEVE THE PLASTER COUNTY AIRPORT STUDY. WE SEE DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS IN THE EMISSIONS PART OF OUR MATTER IT'S SEVERAL THE LAST ITEM IS I'M REMINDED OF A SAYING THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD WHO HAS OFTEN MADE IT'S ACTUALLY A SIMILAR TO WHAT MISS ROBBINS SAID ON YOUR LAST PANEL SHE SAID. PEOPLE MUST CHOOSE THEIR SMOKE. AND MICHAEL THAT YOU'RE OF OUR OFTEN SAYS. WE CAN EITHER HAVE FIRE WHEN WE WANT IT. OR WHEN MOTHER NATURE WANTS IT AND WE'VE SEEN THE DEVASTATING IMPACT ON WHEN MOTHER NATURE DOES IT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO TESTIFY.

AND SOMETIMES IN FIRES GET OUT OF CONTROL BECAUSE OF THE NOT BEING WASHER. YOU KNOW LIKE A PROBLEM THAT THAT YOU ASSUME IS GREATER THAN A GREATER PROBLEM IT REALLY IS- I'M SORRY- THAT I DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT- FIRES AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

GOOD AFTERNOON STACEY HEATON WITH THE WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND I APPRECIATE YOU HOLDING THIS HEARING WE ARE OBVIOUSLY SUPPORTED AND- NOT ONLY TO PRACTICE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE BUT INCREASING THE PACE AND SCALE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE CALIFORNIA BOTH ON STATE AND FEDERAL LANDS. AND PRIVATELY OWNED LANDS WHERE APPROPRIATE WE SEE PRESCRIBED FIRES ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AND THE NEED FOR THAT WERE FEASIBLE IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE TACTICAL I WANT TO SAY THAT WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. COMMENT ABOUT THAT ALSO NEEDING TO REALLY QUAN. B. R. QUALITY.BENEFITS A PRESCRIBE FIRE. THE CASH IN HIGH WILDFIRE ALSO HAVE BEEN. URGING THE STATE AIRBORNE TO QUANTIFY THOSE EMISSIONS FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THEY COME UP WITH PURSUANT AT THE NINE OH ONE SO- WE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND- WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING WORKING WITH THE STATE ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OPERATOR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. MAXWELL I TWENTY. YOU FOR. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BRENDAN ON OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION CAP COLOR REPRESENTING THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS SMALL THIRTY FIVE DISTRICTS THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING THAT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING PER YEAR FOR LOCAL AIR DISTRICT GRANTS FOR INCREASING MONITORING A PRESCRIBED BURNS PUBLIC OUTREACH AND OTHER RELATED WORK AS REQUIRED BY SB TWELVE SIXTY. I'M NOT THAT SB TWELVE SIXTY INCLUDED LANGUAGE REQUIRING ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR LOCAL AIR DISTRICT PARTICIPATION IMPLEMENTATION COST OF THIS NEW SB TWELVE SIXTY REQUIRED PROGRAM IS PROVIDING CRITICAL STATEWIDE BENEFIT. EXPANDING PRESCRIBED FIRE WHICH WILL REQUIRE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT HELP WILL BE KEY TO MEETING THAT GOAL OF TREATING ONE MILLION ACRES OF VEGETATION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS IDENTIFIED IN THE RECENTLY SIGNED U. S. FOREST SERVICE CALIFORNIA AND ARE YOU. DISTRICTS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN MONITORING PRESCRIBED FIRE ANY PUBLIC OUTREACH IN COORDINATION WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR MAKING SURE BIRDS ARE SAFE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO IN CHANGING PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF PRESCRIBED FIRE WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT FOR EXPANSION. DURING THE FIRST YEAR THE PROGRAM AND DISTRICTS VERIFIED NEARLY. THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED PRESCRIBED FIRES. OVER A HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND A RICH WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE INTO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE FIRES WERE MONITORED WITH EBAY ANSWER STATIONARY MONITORS USING THE PROTOCOL DEVELOPED BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND CAPCO. WHILE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IS MODEST THE INVESTMENT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY BENEFITS AND COST SAVINGS. PRESCRIBED FIRE HEADS OFF THE SIGNIFICANT CRITERION TOXIC EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRES INCLUDING THE INCINERATION OF PLASTICS PESTICIDES AND OTHER CHEMICALS THAT ARE CONTAINED WITHIN BUILDINGS VEHICLES AND HOMES. AS OTHER TESTIMONY NOTED TODAY FUNDING RESOURCES IN AIR DISTRICT CAPACITY CAPACITY ARE OF MAJOR CONCERN. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS REGARDING THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AXOLOTL LINE TWENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HOLDING TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND TIMELY TOPIC. I DON'T THOUGH LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE WITNESSES FOR PROVIDING VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION TODAY MY NAME IS PAMELA FLICK AND I'M THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE. AND ALSO A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE SEVEN YEAR PRESCRIBED FIRE COUNCIL AND A LONG TIME ACTED PARTICIPATE IN THE DQ LANDSCAPE PREPARATION PROJECT AND ITS FIRE POLICY WORKGROUP FOR THE PAST DECADE ON THE THEORY NATIONAL FOREST- I DON'T FEEL LIKE TO ECHO A DOCTOR STEVEN AND- COMMENT ABOUT WORKING WITH THE MAKING PROGRESS WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT YOU THAT WORK ON THE DINKY COLLABORATIVE. I AGREE WITH YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD IT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY CHALLENGING TO DO PRESCRIBED FIRE IN CALIFORNIA AND PART OF THAT CHALLENGE ORIGINATES FROM OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR POLICIES. BUT IT'S NOT JUST AFFORD GROWTH ISSUE IT CHARACTERIZED EARLIER IN THE HEARING AS WE'VE HEARD FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF TODAY'S WITNESSES THIS IS A COMPLEX CHALLENGE THAT REQUIRES POLICIES AND FUNDING THAT SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED ON. COURT COMMUNITY PLANNING DECISION A LACK OF A PROACTIVE ACTION AND RESOURCES TO REDUCE HAZRDOUS FUEL AFTER MORE THAN A CENTURY OF UNSUSTAINABLE LOGGING PRACTICES AND AGGRESSIVE FIRE SUPPRESSION POLICIES. LIMITED CAPACITY FOR FIRE LIGHTING VERSUS FIREFIGHTING AND WORKS WORKFORCE TRAINING AND RETENTION. LACK OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF BENEFICIAL FIRE AND REDUCE IMPACT INCREASED NEED FOR INCENTIVES AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR HOME PARDONING AND MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY PROTECTION EFFORT. LIABILITY PROTECTION THE LIST GOES ON AND ON WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR PARTNERSHIPS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE KEY IN THIS WORK AND THE POLICIES AND THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THAT EFFORT. FURTHER WE HAVE MUCH TO LEARN FROM NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES AS WELL AS OTHER REGIONS OF OUR COUNTRY. AS BOTH DR STEVENSON MISS QUINN DAVIDSON ACKNOWLEDGED I YOU THINK LOGICALLY. TO X. WITH THE TORTILLA BOTH BY AND POLICY FOR TO MORE BENEFITS FIRED OUR FIRE ADOPTED CAUSES. AND PROTECT. AND OUR WILDLIFE NATURAL RESOURCE VALUES THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER PLEASE. MAX THE AUTO A LOT PLEASE WELL I HAD. YES BRIT THE K. CATTLEMEN'S. THANK YOU JEFFREY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HOSTING VERY AND- MEETING TODAY AS WELL AS FOR THE EXCELLENT SLATE OF SPEAKERS. I PARTICULARLY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ONE THE QUEEN DAVID SENT TO ACTUALLY ADVISEMENT CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION'S FIRE SUBCOMMITTEE AFFECT OVER COMMENTS REGARDING A LIABILITY CONCERNS AND REGULATORY HURDLES THAT PREVENT OBSTACLES TO PRESCRIBED FIRE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA CATTLE RANCHERS MANAGE MUCH OF THE STATE'S THIRTY EIGHT MILLION ACRES RANGELAND. AND FOR THAT REASON THEIR NATURAL PARTNERS FOR LAND MANAGEMENT INCLUDING THROUGH PRESCRIBED BURNS. UNFORTUNATELY RANGERS HAVE ALSO BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT BY THIS YEAR'S MEGA FIRES OF ALL OF THAT WAS FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE LOS ANGELES TIMES FOR INSTANCE RECENTLY HIGHLIGHTED THE CHIEF HERE'S YOUR MEDIA PAST PRESIDENT. WHOSE PASTORS WERE DESTROYED BY THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE NORTH COMPLEX FIRE. WHICH ALSO KILLED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED OF HIS CATTLE. UNFORTUNATELY MANY RANCHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CAPTURE THIS EXPERIENCE DEVASTATION. YOU HEARD FROM THE QUEEN DAVID SEND THAT RANCHERS ARE DEMANDING THAT COULD CRIED FIRE BE BROUGHT BACK INTO THE TOOL BOX. INDEED THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND ITS MEMBERS WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA MUST PREVENT FUTURE MAJOR FIRES FIRST AND FOREMOST BY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE IN THE STATE. AND WE ARE TO THE CULTURAL PRIOR SPEAKERS FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR PRESCRIBED BURNS IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PRESCRIBED BURNING IS EFFECTIVELY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE MUST ALSO REDUCE THE MANY REGULATORY HURDLES THAT STYMIE PRESCRIBED BURNS SUCH AS THE AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS AND ONEROUS CHIKORE REQUIREMENTS THAT ONE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER. CALIFORNIA MUST ALSO ADDRESS LIABILITY AND INSURANCE CONCERNS RELATED TO PRESCRIBED FIRE. ADDITIONALLY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULDN'T DIRECTOR PORTER BRIEFLY. THIS TODAY CCA BELIEVES THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH INCREASED PRESCRIBED BURNS THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER THE APPLICATION OF PRESCRIBED GRAZING. WHICH RECENT RESEARCH OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COOPER UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SAN BENITO. CONFIRMS CAN REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. FINALLY LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TODAY'S HEARING. AND CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION IS EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE REST OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMING SESSION. TO ACCOMPLISH THE PRIORITIES LAID. TO PRESCRIBED BURNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OPERATOR THE ANY OTHER COLOR. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH AND LIKE YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OPERATOR I'LL GO BACK NOW TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY LAST COMMENTS. MISTER FLORA. WELL I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK FOR ALL OF THE PANELISTS ALL OF THE SPEAKERS FROM THE PUBLIC- WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THIS YEAR TO KEEP MOVING THE STATE INTO A BETTER DIRECTION WHEN IT COMES TO MANAGING ITS OPEN SPACE A WILD LANDS AND BRING MORE FIRE BACK TO HELP BALANCE OUR ECO SYSTEMS. THIS IS SORT OF THE OPENING SALVO AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE GOING TO BE DOING THIS YEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ARE ADJOURNED.
