00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:48.653
THE MENTALITY OF FIRST OF SHOOT

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.189
FIRST ASK QUESTIONS LATER NEEDS

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:52.257
TO STOP.

00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:53.758
WHILE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS

00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:55.226
PERFECTION.

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:57.095
AB THREE NINETY TWO IS A STEP IN

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:58.496
THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARD

AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY

PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.605
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS BILL IN ITS

00:30:07.672 --> 00:30:10.008
CURRENT FORM CAN RAISE.

00:30:10.074 --> 00:30:11.442
QUESTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDERS THERE

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:13.444
ARE SOME THAT BELIEVE THIS BILL

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.646
GOES TOO FAR.

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:15.813
AND THEN OTHERS THEY BELIEVE

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.348
THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT GO FAR

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:18.683
ENOUGH.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.218
WHAT IS CLEAR HOWEVER AT THAT

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:22.554
THIS IS A CRITICAL CONVERSATION

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.022
ABOUT PROTECTING THE LIVES OF

AND OFFICERS ALIKE.

00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:29.894
IS SIMPLY TOO IMPORTANT TO LET

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:31.262
IT FAIL.

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.230
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS COMMERCE

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:34.732
CONVERSATION IS DEEPLY PERSONAL

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.801
AND EMOTIONALLY CHARGED FOR

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:37.936
INDIVIDUALS ON ALL SIDES OF

00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:39.137
DISCUSSION.

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:42.774

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.686
PEOPLE YELL AND FIGHT WITH EACH

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:55.753

DISAGREEMENTS.

00:30:57.755 --> 00:30:59.390
AND TO DATE THAT MUST STOP.

00:30:59.457 --> 00:31:00.959
WE CANNOT MAKE PROGRESS BY

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:02.827
SHUTTING PEOPLE OUT WE CAN ONLY

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:05.129
GROW AND MOVE FORWARD BY WORKING

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:07.198
TOGETHER FOR BETTER.

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.203
THE NEED FOR CHANGE.

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:35.680
EXCESSIVE.

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:37.515
UNNECESSARY AND PUT THE

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:39.083
COMMUNITY AT RISK AND ARE

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.085
ADEQUATE RESOURCES ON THE GROUND

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:49.226

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:54.265
IT BY THE BOOK.

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:56.000
THIS SHOWS NEED TO RE EVALUATE

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:56.934
THE BOOK.

00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:59.704
DOWN LA IN.

GLENN.

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:06.677
GLENN WAS ON HIS STOMACH PUSHING

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:07.978

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:19.090
RARE INSTANCE SAID THAT THE

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:20.224
OFFICER.

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:22.560
NEEDS TO BE PROSECUTED HE SAID

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:24.128
IN RARE OCCASIONS WHERE SHOOTING

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.731
IS NOT JUSTIFIED NOT LEGAL THE

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:28.966
OFFICER SHOULD BE PROSECUTED.

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.568
THE LA DISTRICT ATTORNEY JACKIE

00:39:30.634 --> 00:39:33.037
LACEY DECIDE NOT TO FILE CHARGES

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:34.472
SAID THERE WAS NOT A REASONABLE

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:38.175
DOUBT EVEN THOUGH AND THE

00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:39.643
OFFICER ACTED WITHIN THE LAW.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.778
AND I GUESS THIS LEADS TO THE

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:41.612
QUESTION IF THE POLICE CHIEF BUT

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:42.980
LET'S NATION'S SECOND LARGEST

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:45.249
CITY SHOWS THAT AN OFFICER ACTED

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:47.051
INAPPROPRIATELY BROKE THE LAW

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:48.385
SHOULD BE FIRED AND PROSECUTED

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:50.121
DA SAYS NOPE IT'S ALL GOOD WE

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:52.289
SHOULD RE EVALUATE THE CURRENT

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:54.492
SYSTEM.

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:55.726
EVEN THOUGH THERE WEREN'T FILES

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:57.294
CHARGED IN THE GLENN CASES CITY

00:39:57.361 --> 00:40:00.030
OF LA PAID FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:01.065
TO THE FAMILY.

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:01.966
THAT'S ONE THING WE DON'T TALK

00:40:02.032 --> 00:40:04.168
ABOUT IN YOUR CITY MISTER CHAIR

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:05.636
IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:07.571
CITY OF LA HAD TO BORROW ONE

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:09.073
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.808
WALL STREET TO PAY OUT.

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:12.610
WRONGFUL DEATH SETTLEMENTS THESE

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:13.978
ARE MONIES THAT COULD GO TO

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:15.913
OTHER USES IN OUR COMMUNITIES

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.515
THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO RIGHT NOW

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.350
IS NEGOTIATING A TWENTY MILLION

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:19.950
DOLLAR.

00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:22.653
WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT IN THE CLERK.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.054
IN THE CLERK INCIDENT AGAIN

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:25.556
MONEY THAT COULD GO TO OTHER

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:26.724
PURPOSES.

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:28.459
LASTLY THAT THE OPPOSITION

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.027
STATES AT THIS BILL WOULD

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:32.596
UNDERMINE POLICING AND OFFICERS

00:40:32.663 --> 00:40:34.131
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:35.800
WHEN WHEN I DO THEIR JOB.

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:36.967
BUT AS DOCTOR WEB STATED THIS

00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:39.103
JUST ISN'T TRUE THE POLICY IS

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.205
BASED UPON BEST PRACTICES IN THE

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:41.806
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.140
JUSTICE.

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.041
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:45.476
JUSTICE AND THE STANDARDS ARE

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:47.411
ALREADY IN PLACE IN MAJOR WEST

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:49.313
COAST CITIES SEATTLE AND SAN

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.614
FRANCISCO.

00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:51.348
THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE SEEN

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:53.651
FEWER OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS

00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:56.086
COMMUNITIES ARE SAFER WE BROUGHT

00:40:56.153 --> 00:40:57.354
BACK PUBLIC TRUST.

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:59.790
IN CONCLUSION CHANGE IS HARD.

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:01.625
BUT WE KNOW THERE'S A BETTER WAY

00:41:01.692 --> 00:41:04.662

GO AHEAD.

00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:41.866
GOOD MORNING MR SHARING

00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:42.933
COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.500
JEFF NOBLE AND IS A FORMER

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:46.503
DEPUTY CHIEF OF POLICE I'M HERE

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.438
IN SUPPORT OF AB.

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:48.405
THREE NINETY TWO I SPENT TWENTY

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:49.440
NINE YEARS AS A POLICE OFFICER

00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:51.275
IN CALIFORNIA RETIRING AS THE

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:52.343
DEPUTY CHIEF OF POLICE OF THE

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:55.179
IRVINE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:55.713
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I HAVE

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:56.947
SERVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS IN

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.349
USE OF FORCE CASES ACROSS THE

00:41:58.415 --> 00:41:59.149
COUNTRY.

00:41:59.216 --> 00:42:00.985
INCLUDING CASES THAT INVOLVE THE

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:03.520
DEATHS OF TO MERE RICIN

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:05.055
PHILANDER CASTEEL.

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.423
BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE I AM

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.559
CONFIDENT THAT AB THREE NINETY

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:09.627
TWO IS A REASONABLE STEP TOWARD

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:11.629
REDUCING SHOOTINGS BY POLICE

00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:12.696
OFFICERS IMPROVING

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:14.298
ACCOUNTABILITY AND BEGINNING THE

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:15.165
PROCESS.

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:16.867
OF REBUILDING TRUST BETWEEN THE

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:18.869
POLICE AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.070
ARE MEANT TO SERVE.

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:21.972
AB THREE NINETY TWO CHANGES THE

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.074
LAWS GOVERNING POLICE USE OF

00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:25.876
FORCE IN CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:27.244
CLEAR THAT OFFICERS CAN'T USE

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.079
DEADLY FORCE IF A REASONABLE

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.915
OFFICER WOULD THINK THAT THERE

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:32.850
ARE CURRENT LIVES AVAILABLE.

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:34.018
THAT'S NOT FAR FROM THE

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:36.053
STANDARDS QUIRK SUPPLY NOW BUT

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.988
BY REQUIRING ALTERNATIVES ONLY

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.189
WHEN REASONABLE.

00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:40.991
THE BILL REQUIRES OFFICERS TO

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.793
USE LESS LETHAL WEAPONS AND

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.296
PRACTICE DE ESCALATION IN THOSE

00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:47.464
EIGHT SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S SAFE

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:48.532
TO DO SO.

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:49.867
IN DOING THAT THE BILL IS A

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:51.535
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT ON

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:53.671
EXISTING LAW.

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:55.205
THE PROPOSED CHANGE IS WRONG LAW

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.240
ENFORCEMENT GROUPS OUT IN

00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:57.441
OPPOSITION.

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:59.076
AND IN THIS REGARD FOR THE VERY

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:00.744
REAL NEED FOR CHANGE.

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:02.246
BY ARGUING THAT THIS WILL RESULT

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:05.049
IN INCREASED DANGER FOR OFFICERS.

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:06.850
I BELIEVE THEY ARE WRONG.

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:08.686
I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT OFFICERS

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:09.486
HAVE A TOUGH JOB.

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:10.788
A JOB THAT REQUIRES MAKING

00:43:10.854 --> 00:43:13.090
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT DECISIONS

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:14.959
OFTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:15.926
WITHOUT TRYING TO REVIEW A

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:19.863
MANUAL OR CONSULT THE SUPERVISOR.

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:20.464
EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO IS AN

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:21.565
APPROPRIATE WAY TO ADDRESS THOSE

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:23.167
CHALLENGES.

00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:25.302
UNDER THE BILL OFFICERS ACTIONS

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:26.637
ARE EVALUATED THROUGH THE LENS

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:28.072
OF AN OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:30.407
POLICE OFFICER BASED ON THE

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:31.942
TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:34.812
KNOWN TO THE OFFICER AT THE TIME.

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:36.513
THIS SAME APPROACH TO EVALUATING

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.115
POLICE USE OF FORCE AS COURTS IN

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:39.850
DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY USE UNDER

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:42.019
THE GROUND STANDARD.

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:43.420
NO REASON LOSS OR THINKS IN

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:44.788
OFFICER CONFRONTING AN ACTIVE

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:47.024
SHOOTER HAS TO START NEGOTIATING

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:48.592
A TRY TASER FURS.

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:50.361
WHEN OFFICERS CONFRONTED WITH

00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:50.894
pIMMEDIATE LIFE THREATENING

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.997
DANGER THE NECESSITY STANDARD

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:54.565
WILL STILL ALLOW OFFICERS TO USE

00:43:54.631 --> 00:43:58.168
DEADLY FORCE TO KEEP THEMSELVES

00:43:58.235 --> 00:43:59.269
SAFE OR TO PROTECT OTHERS?

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:01.205
IN THE END AB THREE NINETY TWO

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:02.706
STANDS FOR SIMPLE RULE.

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:04.141
POLICE SHOULD USE DEADLY FORCE

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.576
WHEN IT IS SAFE AND REASONABLE

00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:07.144
TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION IN SOME

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.812
OTHER WAY.

00:44:08.879 --> 00:44:10.214
THIS IS NOT A RADICAL CHANGE.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.116
INDY AB THREE NINETY TWO

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:12.616
PROVIDES A STANDARD IS

00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:14.151
CONSISTENT WITH MUCH OF CURRENT

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:16.253
LAW AND POLICY THAT MOST OF THE

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.755
PUBLIC AGREES WITH AND MANY

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:19.823
COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.525
ASSUME IS ALREADY IN PLACE.

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:22.760
BY WRITING THE STANDARDS INTO

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:24.695
LAW EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:25.562
INSURERS THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:27.097
STATEWIDE WILL CHANGE THEIR

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:29.199
POLICIES AND TRAIN TO CONFORM TO

UNFORTUNATELY AB THREE NINETY

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:01.771

00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:03.373
SITUATION FOR OUR OFFICERS WHEN

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.941

AB THREE NINETY TWO SETS OUT TO

CREATE A NECESSARY STANDARD

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:10.780
BEFORE AN OFFICER CAN USE DEADLY

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:12.983
FORCE AS DEFINED NECESSARY MEANS

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.351
THERE WAS NO REASONABLE

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:16.886
ALTERNATIVE. TO DEADLY FORCE THE

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:19.889
PROBLEM IS THE STANDARD WOULD BE

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:21.358
APPLIED IN HINDSIGHT WHEN

00:54:21.424 --> 00:54:23.393

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:31.901
STANDARD AB THREE NINETY TWO IS

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:33.069
AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD.

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:34.771
OFFICERS ARE OFTEN FORCED TO

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:36.973
MAKE SPLIT SECOND JUDGMENTS IN

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.108
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE TENSE

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:40.977
UNCERTAIN AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING.

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.445
AB THREE NINETY TWO WOULD

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:43.780
REQUIRE SUPER HUMAN DECISION

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:45.615
MAKING THAT IS SIMPLY NOT

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:46.583
POSSIBLE.

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:48.485
STATISTICALLY MOST POLICE

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:49.919
SHOOTINGS USUALLY ARISE OUT OF

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:50.987

UNEVENTFUL SITUATIONS AS

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.158
DISTURBANCES.

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:56.292
INCIDENTS FROM START TO FINISH

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:57.694
ARE VERY TIME COMPRESSED WITH

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:59.896
THE LARGEST NUMBER OCCURRING

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:00.764
UNDER THREE SECONDS.

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.666

THREE SECONDS WHEN CONFRONTING A

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:08.004
LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION.

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.506
IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW NOT

00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.841
ONLY WILL IT NOT CHANGE OUTCOMES

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.410
IN IN DANGER LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:14.844
EXPERTS HAVE SAID IT WILL LEAD

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.146
TO LESS PROACTIVE POLICING

00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:17.647
FURTHER EXACERBATE RECRUITING

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.315

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.550
LESS QUALIFIED TRAINEES AT THE

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:21.685
ACADEMY.

00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:22.986
OFFICERS WILL NOT WANT TO DO

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:24.788
THIS JOB KNOWING THAT WHEN THEY

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:26.890
GET CALLED INTO A SITUATION TO

00:55:26.956 --> 00:55:27.657
HAVE TO MAKE A LIFE OR DEATH

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:28.324
DECISION.

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:30.560
THEY WILL BE PROSECUTED CIVIL

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:31.061

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:37.033
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER

RANGE OF CONDUCT BUT AS

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:14.197

THANK YOU AND THANK YOU DOCTOR

DISCUSSION TO ASK THANK YOU TO

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:11.547
BOTH SIDES. FOR PRESENTING YOUR

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:12.782
TESTIMONY TODAY.

01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:14.183
I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE HEARD

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.419
FROM EVERYBODY IS THE VALUE OF

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.020
THE SANCTITY OF LIFE.

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:19.188
AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON EACH OF

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:20.756
US TO LOOK AT THE SAFETY OF THE

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.159
PUBLIC BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:25.928
AND THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:28.364
ARE OUT ON THE STREETS EVERY DAY.

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.733
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.602
CASES THAT WERE DISCUSSED.

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.337
IS THAT THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:36.839
TOO FAR IN ONE DIRECTION SUCH

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.174
THAT WE AREN'T PROTECTING.

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.075
AND HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE THOSE

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:40.876
WHO ARE TAKING LIFE FROM OUR

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.511
COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:44.547
I DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:46.015
THE TEXT OF THIS LANGUAGE SWINGS

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:47.650
THE PENDULUM TOO FAR IN THE

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:48.985
OTHER DIRECTION.

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.219
BECAUSE THE SANCTITY OF THE LIFE

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:51.687
OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:53.289
EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT.

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:55.324
WE ASK THEM EVERY DAY TO GO OUT

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:57.360
AND PROTECT US AND SERVICE THEY

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:58.995
TAKE OATHS TO DO JUST THAT.

01:04:59.061 --> 01:04:59.895
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:01.330
THE BILL THAT WE PASSED THROUGH

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:02.298
THIS BODY.

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.066
DRAWS THE CORRECT BALANCE

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:08.237
BETWEEN THOSE TWO CONCERNS.

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:10.940
AS I READ THE BILL -- I DON'T

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:11.440
KNOW THAT I AGREE WITH

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:12.742
EVERYTHING THE OPPOSITION IS

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:14.610
SAID ABOUT IT BUT I HAVE SERIOUS

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:15.211
CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:17.747
INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN SECTIONS

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:20.149
ONE NINETY SIX AND EIGHT THIRTY

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:20.683
FIVE AND HOW THAT WOULD BE

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.717
CONSTRUED BY COURT.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:24.520
I'VE CONCERNS ABOUT SECTION A

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:25.855
FOR AND WHETHER THAT GOES TOO

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:30.359
FAR IN THE WRONG DIRECTION --

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:31.961
BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION IS

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.229
TO CONTINUE BECAUSE CLEARLY THE

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:34.964
BALANCES OFF RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.565
LOSING LIVES UNNECESSARILY AND

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:37.099
PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING HELD

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:39.302
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:41.103
BUT DOCTOR ABROAD LIKE TO ASK

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.039
YOU -- I'D LIKE TO ENSURE YOU'RE

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:43.906
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:45.675
OPPOSITION MOVING FORWARD TO

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:47.009
MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THIS BILL

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.478
HITS THE FLOOR WE DO HAVE THE

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:53.582
RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:55.551
I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY AWARE -- I

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.019
KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE NEW HERE BUT

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:58.387
PROBABLY WHERE THE WE SPENT THE

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:01.657
LAST YEAR WORKING ON REACHING OF

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:03.859
SOME TYPE OF COMPROMISE AND WE

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:05.294
WILL COMMITTED TO DOING THAT NOT

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.096
ONLY ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:08.731
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.066
AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT I

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:12.234
MEAN WE'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE --

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:13.736
THE END OF LAST SESSION WHICH

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.738
WAS IN SEPTEMBER -- DILIGENTLY

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.139
AND DID NOT IMMEDIATELY

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:18.674
INTRODUCED THE BILL BECAUSE WE

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:20.343
WERE WORKING AND HELPING TO

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:22.111
BRING A COMPROMISE SO WE ARE

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:24.146
COMMITTED TO THAT -- AND AND

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:25.581
WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE HOPE

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.916
THAT THERE'S ALSO SIMILAR

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:28.284
COMMITMENT ON BOTH SIDES WE KNOW

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:29.785
THERE HAS TO BE A COMING

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:31.854
TOGETHER OF TWO SITES AND WATER --

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:32.855
TO ROBERT SOME CONCLUSIONS

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:34.924
THAT'S NECESSARY -- SO WE'RE

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:36.292
VERY COMMITTED TO THAT WE'RE

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:38.294
COMMITTED TO HAVING A PIECE OF

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:38.794
LEGISLATION THAT MAKES A

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:39.562
DIFFERENCE.

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:41.897
AND THAT DOES PROVIDE A BALANCE

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:44.200
THIS IS NOT A A BILL IF YOU LOOK

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:46.202
AT IT CAREFULLY AS YOU LISTEN TO

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.536
THE OFFICERS AND THOSE WHO ARE.

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:48.871
SPEAKING OUT IN SUPPORT OF IT

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:50.940
IT'S NOT A BILL DESIGNED TO MAKE

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:52.475
ANYBODY'S UNSAFE.

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:53.309
IT'S DESIGNED TO MAKE ALL OF US

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.144
SAFE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:57.880
IT IN OTHER AREAS AS INDICATED

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:58.914
THAT IT DOES DO THAT.

01:06:58.981 --> 01:06:59.548
UNTIL WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:01.384
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:02.685
SURE THAT WE TRY TO REACH SOME

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:05.221
COMPROMISE BEFORE THIS GOES TO

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:06.555
THE FLOOR.

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:07.123
THANK YOU.

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.691
AND THEN AS YOU KNOW I HAVE

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:12.395
SPENT MANY.

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:13.863
HOURS READING.

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:15.064
AND DISCUSSING THIS WITH ALSO

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:15.731
HAS -- I THINK THE VOTE ON THIS

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:16.298
IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:16.932
WE'VE HEARD TODAY FROM. THREE

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:19.168
PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE LOSS

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:20.202
OF LIVES.

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:22.071
IN THEIR OWN LIFE ON BOTH SIDES

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:22.905
OF THIS ISSUE AND WE NEED TO

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:24.407
MAKE SURE THAT AND I KNOW WE'RE

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:25.374
ALL COMMITTED.

INCLUDING YOU DOCTOR EVER TO

AND VOTING TODAY TO MOVE THIS

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:35.451
CONVERSATION BOARD I LOOK FOR TO

SING A BILL THAT IS.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.554
A LITTLE BIT CLEARER TO ME ON

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.623
THE FLOOR AND THAT -- STRIKES

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:44.260
THAT NECESSARY NESS PROTECTS

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.095
HUMAN LIFE ON ALL SIDES AND DOES

FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOURTH

01:08:58.734 --> 01:08:59.034
AND CONTINUING.

01:08:59.101 --> 01:08:59.668
THE CONVERSATION OVER THE YEAR

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:00.402
PLUS YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS --

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.605
AND FOR THE WITNESSES WHO --

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.907
HAVE TESTIFIED TODAY ON BOTH

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.243
SIDES -- I ALSO HAVE TREMENDOUS

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:08.444
RESPECT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.912
OFFICIALS AND IF I THINK THE

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.480
VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE.

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:12.848
FOLKS WHO ARE.

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.149
DOING THE BEST IN THE SITUATION

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.317
THAT THEY'RE IN AND THEY ARE OUR

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:16.185
BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.453
HUSBANDS AND WIVES THEY'RE PART

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.121
OF OUR COMMUNITY.

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:20.723
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT -- EFFECTIVE

01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:23.025
LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFECTIVE

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:24.426
PLACINGS BUILT ON TRUST.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:25.227
AND IN FAR TOO MANY COMMUNITIES

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:26.328
PARTICULARLY BLACK BLACK AND

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:27.863
BROWN COMMITTEES THAT TRUSSES

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:28.898
BEEN LOST.

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:30.599
AND I I BELIEVE WHAT THIS

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.067
CONVERSATION IS RAISING IS.

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:34.703
A CONVERSATION AROUND SOME VERY

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.171
UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.306
SOME UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS THAT

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:38.807
WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:40.409
BROWN AND BLACK FOLKS BROWN AND

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:41.443
BLACK MEN.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.579
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY KILLED AT

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:46.215
THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:46.849
I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.150
TODAY.

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:49.652
AND I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT.

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:53.556
STEP AN IMPORTANT BILL -- ONE OF

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.591
THE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK --

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:57.226
DEPUTY CHIEF NOBLE.

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:58.961
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A LAW

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.630
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL YOU KNOW

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:02.231
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEAR

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:03.032
IS.

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:04.567
LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TRAINING

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:05.634
BUT WE DON'T NEED ENFORCEABLE

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:07.002
STANDARDS THE ENFORCEABLE

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:09.338
STANDARDS OF NECESSARY FORCE IN

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:10.773
AB.

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:11.574
THREE NINETY TWO CAN YOU TALK

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.208
DIRECTLY ABOUT WHY YOU THINK

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.110
THAT CHANGE IN USE OF FORCE

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:17.012
POLICY THAT LANGUAGE.

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:21.951
IS CRITICAL FOR THIS BILL.

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:22.985
I'M SORRY I ABSOLUTELY AGREE

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:23.786
THAT POLICE OFFICERS NEED

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:24.386
TRAINING IN THE MORE TRAINING

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.021
GIVE OUR POLICE OFFICERS THE

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.856
BETTER OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE FOR

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:29.224
SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.326
CONCLUSION OF THE THAT IS.

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.194
THE REASON WHY THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:33.729
A BILL LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:35.664
THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSEQUENCES

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:36.832
AND ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THAT

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:39.168
VERY VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:41.170
OFFICERS WHO ABANDON THEIR

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:43.339
RESPONSIBILITIES WHO STAND IN

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:44.840
FRONT OF A CAR INSTEAD AND USE

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.308
DEADLY FORCE RATHER THAN TAKING

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:47.810
A STEP TO THE SIDE.

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:50.245
WHO CREATE DANGER -- DUE TO

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.081
RECKLESS TACTICS THIS IS NOT

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:54.183
ABOUT SITUATIONS WHERE AN

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.751
OFFICER IS CONFRONTED WITH A

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.252
SPLIT SECOND DECISION.

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:59.021
IN THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.889
TRULY CONFRONTED WITH A SPLIT

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:02.625
SECOND DECISION DEFERENCE SHOULD

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.326
BE GIVEN TO THE DECISION MAKING

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:05.461
OF THE OFFICER.

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.963
BUT MANY SITUATIONS THE VAST

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.697
MAJORITY TO SITUATIONS I WOULD

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:10.966
ARGUE EVOLVED OVER TIME WHAT

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:12.668
TACTICS AND DE ESCALATION

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:18.273
TECHNIQUES MAY BE USED. TO TO

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.043
ATTEMPT TO LOWER.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.811
THE THE THE RUB IS AT THE END OF

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:25.247
THE DAY THAT EVEN WITH DE

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:25.814
ESCALATION THAT'S NOT A FAIL

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:26.015
SAFE.

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:27.383
AND IF AN OFFICER STILL NEEDS TO

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:28.784
USE FORCE IMMEDIATELY NEEDS TO

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:29.084
USE FORCE.

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:30.786
THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY USE FORCE

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:31.787
AND WE SHOULD HAVE ROAD OFFICERS

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:33.188
LIKE THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO SPOKE

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:34.790
TO THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE WHO IS

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:36.191
ABSOLUTELY WHO WROTE.

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:38.694
WHO WHO ANSWERED THE CALL TO

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:40.696
SERVE AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY --

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:42.531
AND SUFFERED THIS INCREDIBLE

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:44.366
TRAGEDY THIS IS WHAT WE WANT WE

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:46.068
WANT YOUNG HEROES LIKE THIS

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.703
YOUNG WOMAN WHO IS UP UP

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:48.937
TESTIFYING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE.

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:50.172
BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.573
OFFICERS WHO ABANDON THEIR

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.909
TRAINING WHO ABANDON THEIR

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:54.743
COMMON SENSE IN BAND THEIR THEIR

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:57.346
DECISION MAKING AND IT RESULTS

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.947
IN IN THE LOSS OF LIFE.

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.949
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT LOOK

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:03.018
THAT CONTEXT ON THE OTHER THING

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:04.987
THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT IS YOU KNOW

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:06.121
ASKING THAT.

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.089
AND THE IDEA OF SORT OF

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.191
REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES WOULD BE

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:10.125
TOO COMPLICATED.

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:11.393
WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM FROM

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.194
OPPOSITION THAT OFFICERS WOULD

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:14.263
HAVE TO MAKE -- DECISIONS AND

01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:16.799
SPLIT SECOND -- AND THEY DON'T

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:17.966
HAVE THE CAPACITY OR ABILITY TO

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.368
KIND OF RUN THROUGH A CHECKLIST

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:20.736
OF OPTIONS BEFORE USING FORCE

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:21.970
THERE BY PUTTING THEMSELVES IN

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:23.539
DANGER.

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:25.107
CAN YOU SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THAT.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.176
WHY ABSOLUTELY AGREE WE DON'T

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.510
GIVE OFFICERS A CHECKLIST AYE

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:29.611
AYE I TALK ABOUT THEM IN MY

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:30.813
STATEMENT IS THAT YOU KNOW THESE

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:32.014
ARE SITUATIONS WHERE OFFICERS

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:33.115
THEY CAN'T MAKE A PHONE CALL

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.817
THEY CAN'T REFER TO A MANUAL

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.151
THEY CAN'T CALL SUPERVISOR?

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:37.519
THEY HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND

01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:39.088
THAT'S WHERE THEIR TRAINING --

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:41.123
COMES INTO PLAY IS NOT JUST

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.124
CLASSROOM TRAINING BUT IS

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.660
SIMULATION TRAINING -- THESE

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.829
DISCUSSIONS IS PRACTICED -- I

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:48.397
DON'T EXPECT PERFECT DECISIONS I

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:49.965
EXPECT DECISIONS TO FALL WITHIN

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.567
A REASONABLE RANGE BASED ON THE

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:52.901
CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:54.503
SO WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:55.504
IS THE TOTALITY OF THE

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:56.739
CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO IN THAT

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:59.675
INDIVIDUAL OFFICER AT THE MOMENT

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:00.576
THAT THEY USE THE FORCE.

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:02.778
NOT IT WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:03.779
TWENTY TWENTY HINDSIGHT.

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.547
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:07.516
OFFICER KNEW NOT WHAT WE LOOK WE

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:10.385
MAY LEARN LATER ON AND WITH

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:12.020
TWENTY TWENTY HINDSIGHT IS NOT.

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:13.989
A PASS FOR ALL DECISIONS THAT

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.190
POLICE OFFICERS MAKE WE

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:22.197
ABSOLUTELY REVIEW POLICE OFFICER

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:25.000
JUST IS MAKING WE REVIEW IT WITH

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:25.534
OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS FOR

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:26.635
ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINE

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:27.936
TRAINING WE REVIEW IN THE CIVIL

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:29.638
COURSE ALL THE TIME -- SO POLICE

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:31.406
DECISION MAKING IS REVIEWED IT

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:32.040
SHOULD BE REVIEW OF ALL -- AND

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:33.208
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DO IT

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:33.842
WITHOUT LOOKING AT IN HINDSIGHT

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:34.510
AND SO IN YOUR OPINION THIS BILL

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:35.310
WILL NOT PUT OFFICERS IN HARM'S

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.279
WAY.

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:46.355
NO I DON'T BELIEVE SO THANK YOU.

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:47.589
IT'S DOCTOR WEBER IT'S MY

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:49.324
COMMITTEE.

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:51.393
TALK TO WEBER.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.494
NO I WAS JUST WONDERING I DON'T

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:53.395
KNOW IF THE OTHER OFFICER SHE

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:54.363
ASKED HIM TO THE QUESTIONS AND

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:56.064
SHE HAD ANYTHING TO ADD TO IT

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:58.801
BUT WE CAN THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

01:13:58.867 --> 01:13:59.802
THANK YOU SO WHAT I KNOW IS THAT

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:00.702
MAKING SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS OR

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.404
INHERENT TO POLICE WORK -- IF

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:03.672
SINCE WE'RE COMMON EVERYONE

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.240
WOULD HAVE IT AND I SAID IN MY

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.608
STATEMENT THAT NOT EVERYONE WHO

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:08.143
WANTS TO BE THE POLICE SOULD BE

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.778
AND SO CERTAINLY WE WANT TO HIRE

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.013
OFFICERS.

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.314
PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY WHO

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:13.582
CAN MAKE THOSE SPLIT SECOND

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.317
DECISIONS AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:17.853
ANYTHING EXTRA FOR AN OFFICER IN

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.888
A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION MUCH

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.056
LIKE WHAT IT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.791
DO IF I COMMIT A TRAFFIC STOP.

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.159
I'VE GOT TO DECIDE REALLY QUICK

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.260
WHERE I WANT TO STOP YOU WHEN

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.628

FAIRLY QUICKLY MUCH LIKE THE USE

OF DEADLY FORCE WHAT WE'RE

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:43.679
SEEING IS THAT OFFICERS ARE

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:44.847
USING DEADLY FORCE AS A FIRST

01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:46.415
RESORT WHEN THEYCAN'T CATCH

01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:49.518
SOMEONE WHEN SOMEONE IS FAILING

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:50.152
TO COMPLY.

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:51.220
AS OPPOSED TO A LAST RESORT

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:52.354
WHICH IS WHAT OFFICERS ARE

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:53.555
TAUGHT TO DO AFTER YOU'VE DONE

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:55.090
EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:56.992
AVAILABLE TO YOU AND NONE OF

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:58.527
THAT HAS WORKED IN YOU CAN GET

01:14:58.594 --> 01:14:59.261
TO THAT.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:00.696
IN A MATTER OF SECONDS BUT

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.264
YOU'RE ONLY TO USE DEADLY FORCE

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.565
AFTER YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:05.500

TAUGHT AND NO TO DO.

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:08.203
AND THEN THERE NEED TO BE SOME

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.072
REASONABLENESS WITH REGARDS TO

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:11.740

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:45.974
BILL KIND OF RE STATES WHAT THE

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.210
STANDARD SHOULD BE RIGHT AND I

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:49.745
ACTUALLY WISH WE COULD BE IN A

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:51.546
PLACE WHERE WE COULD BE

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:53.181
REPEALING.

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:54.716
THIS KIND.

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:56.351
OF BELL RATHER THAN TALKING

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:58.020
ABOUT GETTING IT PASSED AND

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.454
SIGNED INTO LAW.

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:02.057
BUT WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET.

01:16:02.124 --> 01:16:04.459
AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE NOT

01:16:04.526 --> 01:16:06.528
THERE YET IS BECAUSE WE CONTINUE

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:07.629
TO SEE.

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:10.832
AND READ ABOUT SO MANY KILLINGS

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.668
THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:15.904
IMPACTING BLACKS BROWN PEOPLE

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:18.006
THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:20.042
THOSE WHO ARE POOR.

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:22.744
AND THE TRAUMA THAT COMES FROM

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:25.380
SEEING THAT REPEATEDLY.

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:28.951
MAKES PEOPLE BEGIN TO QUESTION

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:31.353
THEIR OWN SAFETY.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.088
AND THEIR OWN RIGHT TO LIFE.

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.456
AND WHEN THAT CONTINUES TO

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:37.225
HAPPEN YOU ARE FORCED TO YOU

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:38.794
SHOULD BE FORCED TO HAVE.

01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:41.196
THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:45.167
I I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT --

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:47.803
THAT TAXED AM THAT I HOPE ALL

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:51.139
SIDES -- CAN ANSWER BUT I DO

01:16:51.206 --> 01:16:54.876
ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT -- WE NEED

LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.146
WE ABSOLUTELY NEED LAW

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:01.616
ENFORCEMENT AND WE SHOULDN'T

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:04.052
WANT TO BE CRIMINALIZING LAW

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:05.854
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I WOULD

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:08.890
ACTUALLY ADD THAT -- OUR CIVIL

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:11.893
SOCIETY IS ACTUALLY PREDICATED.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.863
ON HAVING LAW AND ORDER AND

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.465
HAVING POLICE OFFICERS THAT WE

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:18.433
CAN TRUST THAT ARE NOT GOING TO

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.068
BE INCARCERATED I THINK WHEN

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:21.703
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN.

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:22.637
YOU ACTUALLY BEGIN TO

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:25.407
DISINTEGRATE THE FABRIC OF OUR

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:26.975
CIVIL SOCIETY.

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.910
SO TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:30.946
RIGHT NOW IN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:32.647
SUGGESTS WE ARE AT A CRITICAL

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.516
JUNCTURE.

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:36.351
ABOUT HOW OUR SOCIETY IS

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:38.086
OPERATING.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.522
I'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF YOU ALL

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:43.492
TALK ABOUT CRIMINALIZING USE OF

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.459
FORCE AND SO I JUST NEEDED SOME

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:46.261

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:51.600
IN THIS BILL IF AN OFFICER USES

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:52.801
DEADLY FORCE I DIDN'T READ

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:54.603
ANYTHING ABOUT AN OFFICER BEING

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:56.138
CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR OR AN

OFFICER BEING CHARGED WITH A

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:57.873
FELONY.

01:17:57.939 --> 01:17:59.708
SO MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:02.444
BUT ARE THERE ARE PENALTIES THAT

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:07.049

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:13.882
MOMENT.

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:14.916
AND SO THE REALITY IS THAT

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:16.585
ACTUALLY YOU KNOW IF AN INCIDENT

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.053

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:25.060
A VERY STRONG COHESIVE

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:29.064

TO A QUESTION MAYBE I KNOW BUT

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.171
PLEASE SHARE YES.

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.873
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT IT

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.241
IS STILL UP TO THE DISTRICT

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:41.910
ATTORNEY ON TO INVESTIGATE TO

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:43.345
MAKE FACTUAL DETERMINATIONS AS

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:44.679
TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:46.982
ON BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND TO

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:48.683
MAKE A DECISION AND THAT

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.585
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS DISCRETION

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:52.087
ABOUT WHETHER TO CHARGE

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:52.387
[inaudible]

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.588
OR NOT.

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:56.324
AND THEN -- IN FACT IN THE

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:57.526
SECTION THAT TALKS ABOUT THE

01:19:57.592 --> 01:20:00.996
TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES --

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:02.731
I READ THAT.

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:05.066
OR MAYBE IT'S MY INTERPRETATION

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:06.935
THAT IT STILL IS GIVING -- IT

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:07.936
BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THE BASED

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.104
ON THE TOTALITY OF THE

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:10.405
CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO OUR

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:11.473
PROCEED BY THE OFFICER AT THAT

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.275
TIME SO I READ THAT IS STILL

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:18.747
GIVING QUITE A BIT OF DISCRETION

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:19.648
VISIONS.

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:21.283
AND SO AM I MISINTERPRETING

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:22.851
SOMETHING BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:24.686
FROM YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT IT WILL

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:25.787
LIMIT.

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:27.589
OF POLICE OFFICERS ABILITY TO

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:29.791
ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOB WHICH IS

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:31.626
WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO SO --

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.995
AND I THINK ALL FOLKS AT THE

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:34.529
DíAS.

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.464
AT THE TABLE SHOULD FEEL FREE TO

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.166
SHARE.

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.267
BUT DOES IT STILL GIVES.

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:40.702
POLICE OFFICERS THE DISCRETION

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:43.205
TO DO THEIR WORK AND MAKE THOSE

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:44.839
KINDS OF QUICK JUDGMENT.

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:45.840
UP I CAN I CAN START SAY BRIEFLY

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:48.410
I BELIEVE ABSOLUTELY SO AND IN

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:49.377
PARTICULAR.

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:50.879
THE DEFINITION OF TOTALITY OF

THE STANDARD HIRED TO

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:01.342
UNNECESSARY STANDARD RATHER THAN

QUESTIONS -- BECAUSE THIS IS

01:28:14.188 --> 01:28:15.490
SOMETHING THAT.

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:17.291
I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SINCE

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:18.593
WE STARTED SESSION.

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.194
I GUESS I COULD ARGUE THAT THIS

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:22.430
IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN THINKING

01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:24.198
ABOUT EVER SINCE I MARRIED A

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:25.733
BLACK MAN WHO HAD.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.736
WHO HAS BLACK CHILDREN -- I

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:30.271
STILL BELIEVE THAT IT IS UP TO

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:31.339
THE DA TO MAKE THESE

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:33.775
DETERMINATIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:35.476
OF CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE AND IF AN

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:36.611
OFFICER COULD WOULD BE

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:37.712
PROSECUTED.

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.847

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:42.050
OF THESE SITUATIONS AFTER

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:43.084
INCIDENTS.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.253
OF ANY KIND HAPPEN THAT OFFICERS

01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:47.188
WOULD BE HAVING DEBRIEFING

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:49.390
SESSIONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:50.425
HOW TO INCORPORATE BETTER BACK

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:52.193
BEST PRACTICES INTO THEIR

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.127
TRAINING.

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:54.862
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY IF

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:57.398
NOTHING ELSE MISTER CHAIR --

01:28:57.465 --> 01:29:00.468

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:01.302
PAUSE.

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:04.172
ON HOW WE INTERACT WITH EACH

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:05.139
OTHER.

01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:06.207
THE PUBLIC.

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:07.575
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THE

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:09.510

THEY CAME IN THEY CHECKED THE

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:21.048
PERIMETER OF THE HOUSE AND THEN

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:22.550
THEY WENT INSIDE TO MAKE SURE

01:30:22.617 --> 01:30:24.018
THAT NOTHING WAS GOING ON

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:26.187
BECAUSE THE ALARM HAD GONE OFF.

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.923
I PUT DOWN MY GROCERIES.

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.924
I STOOD THERE AND I LISTEN TO

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:35.730
RESPECTFUL.

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:40.301
THAT I STARTED SHAKING.

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:42.703
I STARTED CRYING.

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:45.239
IN MY OWN HOME.

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:46.841
AND I REALIZED.

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:47.975
THAT I WAS CRYING BECAUSE I WAS

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:49.977
AFRAID.

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:51.612
I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ANY SUDDEN

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:53.314
MOVEMENTS.

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:55.650
I THOUGHT MAYBE WILL I GET SHOT

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:58.119
IN MY OWN HOME BECAUSE I DO

01:30:58.186 --> 01:30:59.187
SOMETHING.

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.189
THAT MAKES THEM CONCERNED OR

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:03.591
FEARFUL.

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:05.560

01:31:30.484 --> 01:31:32.420
THAT I AM A RELATIVELY YOUNG

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:34.222
BLACK WOMAN.

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.489
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PRIVILEGE

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:38.593
LESS THAN MANY MANY OTHERS.

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:42.363
AND I WAS AFRAID.

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:44.065
THAT REVEALED MY OWN TRAUMA

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:45.967

AND WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WE

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:16.364
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO WORK WITH

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:19.233
COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE.

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.835
TO SAY HOW DO WE PROTECT LAW

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.149
WHEN I SAY WE ARE NO LONGER A

01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:50.384
MEMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT I WAS

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:53.020
FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS.

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:54.622
SO I I DO BELIEVE I UNDERSTAND

01:34:54.688 --> 01:34:56.657
THAT PERSPECTIVE.

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:58.459
AND I JUST WANT TO CLEARLY TRY

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:00.261
TO BRING SOME BALANCE TO THIS

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:01.162
DISCUSSION.

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:03.264
BECAUSE I KNOW THE EMOTION OF

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:06.867
DISTRESS IS HUGELY POWERFUL.

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:07.468
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO DISCOUNT

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:08.369
THAT.

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:10.805
I TRIED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:11.939
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:14.909
THIS ONE PART OF THIS BILL.

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:16.744
I CAN NEVER SUPPORT.

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:18.412
IT'S NOT NEGOTIABLE AND THAT IS

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:20.514
THE TERM REASONABLE.

01:35:20.581 --> 01:35:22.116
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ALL

01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:23.717
PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO SWEAR

01:35:23.784 --> 01:35:26.087
WILLINGNESS TO DIE.

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:28.222
IN PRESERVING PEACE.

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:29.457
ARE THREATENED BY THIS VERY VERY

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:32.993
TERM.

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.795
IMAGINE HOW THE PROPOSAL OF

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.530
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.599
WOULD BE RECEIVED.

01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:39.967
THAT'S HOW DRAMATIC THIS POLICY

01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:42.903
SHIFT HAVE.

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:44.605
AND I'M TELLING YOU WHY I MEAN

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:44.805
EVEN.

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:46.474
I'M NOT.

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.008
SUGGESTING THAT TAKE PLACE AT

01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:49.977
ALL.

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:52.179
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT'S

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:53.581
THE DRAMATIC IMPACT.

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:57.051
CHANGING THE WORD REASONABLE.

01:35:57.118 --> 01:35:58.519
IN THE ABILITY TO PROTECT

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.488
ONESELF WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:02.656
THEIR LIFE IS THREATENED.

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:04.458
THAT'S A SUPREME COURT TESTED

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:05.759
STANDARD EVERYONE.

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:06.861
AND I THINK A LOT OF THE AND

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:09.630
JUSTICE THAT HAS HAPPENED.

01:36:09.697 --> 01:36:11.899
HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:12.500
RULING.

01:36:12.566 --> 01:36:14.468
OF A JURY.

01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:16.637
AND A TRIAL.

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:17.838
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A PERFECT

01:36:17.905 --> 01:36:20.941
STANDARD.

01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:21.709
BUT I COULD TELL YOU.

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:24.145
WITH OUT ANY HESITATION.

01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:25.713
AND I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SHARE A

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:30.985
VERY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE MYSELF.

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:32.119
AND I SEE THERE'S GROANS IN

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:33.621
RESPONSE TO THAT BUT I THINK

01:36:33.687 --> 01:36:35.189
IT'S IT'S AND DESERVES TO BE

01:36:35.256 --> 01:36:36.457
MENTIONED.

01:36:36.524 --> 01:36:38.259
I HAVE A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF

01:36:38.325 --> 01:36:39.160
MINE.

01:36:39.226 --> 01:36:40.194
WHO SERVED ALSO IN LAW

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:42.429
ENFORCEMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY

01:36:42.496 --> 01:36:43.430
RETIRED?

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:44.932
DURING THE COURSE OF HIS.

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:47.067
SERVICE.

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:47.635
HE WAS INVOLVED IN A DEADLY

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:49.336
SHOOTING. TO WHERE HE HAD TO

01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:50.871
TAKE THE LIFE OF A PERSON WHO

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:55.409
WAS ATTACKING HIM.

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.011
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:59.780
INCIDENT CHANGED HIS LIFE.

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:01.782
AND NOT FOR THE GOOD.

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:04.852
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS JUSTIFIABLE.

01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:06.053
THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO TAKE

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.422
SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE [inaudible]

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:11.692
CAUSED HIM [inaudible] TO ADAPT.

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.194
TO THAT CHALLENGE IN A WAY THAT

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.461
WAS HURTFUL.

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:17.131
AND IT LED TO AN ADDICTION.

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:18.065
THE LEAD TO A A FAMILY

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:20.201
INTERVENTION.

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:21.268
AND THE FAMILY INTERVENTION

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.671
TRIED TO REACH OUT AND SUPPORT

01:37:23.737 --> 01:37:26.807
THIS FRIEND OF MINE.

01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:30.911
LIFE.

01:37:30.978 --> 01:37:32.479
AND THAT SOMEONE IS FORGOTTEN IN

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:34.915
THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT.

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:36.517
WHEN PEACE OFFICERS ARE PLACED

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:38.185
IN A POSITION? TO WHERE THEY

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:40.487
FEEL LIKE.

01:37:40.554 --> 01:37:42.089
THEY HAVE TO USE DEADLY FORCE.

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:43.657
NO ONE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:37:43.724 --> 01:37:44.291
THAT UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:45.960
POSITION.

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:46.794
AND I WOULD JUST ASK

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:47.094
[inaudible]

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:50.965
THE IF WE NEED TO MAKE SOME

01:37:51.031 --> 01:37:52.466
ADJUSTMENTS LET'S MAKE THOSE

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:54.034
ADJUSTMENTS BUT LET'S ANYTHING

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:56.570
THAT.

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:58.272
CHANGES THE WORD REASONABLE.

01:37:58.339 --> 01:38:00.941
IN THE ABILITY. TO DEFEND

01:38:01.008 --> 01:38:03.444
ONESELF IS UNREASONABLE.

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:06.513
AND I WOULD ASK THE JUST NOT BE

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:08.182
THE MEASURE THAT WE USED TO

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:09.216
BUILD BACK TRUST BECAUSE IT WILL

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:11.285
DO.

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:13.988
MORE DAMAGE AND VERY VERY.

01:38:14.054 --> 01:38:15.656
SAD CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:17.825
OFFICERS WILL HESITATE.

01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:19.893
THAT HESITATION.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:20.761
WILL CAUSE A LOT WILL RESULT IN

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:22.963
LOSS OF LIFE AND I DON'T THINK

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:25.132
ANYBODY WANTS THAT THANK YOU.

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:27.368
THANK YOU MISTER [inaudible]

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:45.219
A VERY A VERY PASSIONATE

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:46.487
EMOTIONS ON BOTH SIDE I WANT TO

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:47.655

SHE DOES HAVE THE COURAGE. TO

01:38:54.728 --> 01:38:56.964
FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS

01:38:57.031 --> 01:39:02.102

FRONTLINE OFFICERS [inaudible]

AN ACCEPTABLE MEDIUM.

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:35.736
ANYWHERE BETWEEN.

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:37.838
WHAT IT IS THAT THE AUTHOR OF

01:39:37.905 --> 01:39:39.273
THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:42.109
VERSES WHAT -- OUR LAW

SOME RESERVATION ABOUT THIS BILL

01:40:05.265 --> 01:40:07.668
TODAY.

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:09.169
THIS IS THE COMMITTEE THIS THE

01:40:09.236 --> 01:40:11.038
POLICY COMMITTEE WHERE.

01:40:11.105 --> 01:40:15.008
WE SHOULD WORK THIS OUT.

01:40:15.075 --> 01:40:16.143
BECAUSE IF WE LET THIS BILL.

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:17.378
GET OFF THE FLOOR HOW DO YOU

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:18.679
NEGOTIATE WITH [inaudible]

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:21.415
EIGHTY MEMBERS -- THE EIGHT OF

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:23.851

HALF THE POWER WITHIN THIS BODY.

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:30.090
TO SEE IF WE CAN COME.

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:32.993
TO AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION TO

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.229
BOTH SIDES IF THERE IS -- ONE TO

01:40:35.295 --> 01:40:37.598
TO BE HAPPY.

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:38.899
BUT IF WE COME HERE AND AND WE

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:44.238
WE WE UNDERSTAND ISSUES.

01:40:44.304 --> 01:40:45.639
WE WILL MOVE THIS BILL FOR FOR

01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:47.574
FURTHER.

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:49.943
NEGOTIATIONS I DON'T KNOW IF

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:50.911
THAT IS.

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:55.949
THE RIGHT APPROACH.

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:58.719
AND AND AND FOR THAT TODAY IS

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:00.454
GERMAN -- I WILL NOT BE

01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:02.589

COLLEAGUES DOES THAT STILL HAVE

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:11.899
SOME RESERVATION ABOUT THIS BILL.

01:41:11.965 --> 01:41:13.400
TO KEEP IT HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:15.002
LONGER TO THE WE HAVE THE

01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:18.839
OPPORTUNITY WORK ON IT.

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:21.642
WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR?

YET TO COME -- I JUST WANT TO

01:41:35.956 --> 01:41:36.523
START BY SAYING LOOK THAT THIS

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:37.157
IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE SO I WE

01:41:37.224 --> 01:41:40.194
DIFFERENT OPINIONS BECAUSE NONE

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:40.828
OF OUR BILLS ARE PERFECT IN THE

01:41:40.894 --> 01:41:41.228
FIRST COMMITTEE.

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:42.696
I MEAN WE'VE OFTEN SAT BEFORE

01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:43.597
CHAIRS WITH OFTEN SAT BEFORE --

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:44.698
COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN AND DISCUSS

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:45.966
THE FACT THAT OUR BILLS WILL

01:41:46.033 --> 01:41:47.668
CHANGE AND IN FACT.

01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:48.302
YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR AND I WERE

01:41:48.368 --> 01:41:50.504
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING.

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:51.338
PROPOSAL THAT I'M MOVING FORWARD.

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:53.340
TOTALLY DIFFERENT COMMITTEE

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:54.875
RIGHT NO MY STE WHY NO MY BILLS

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:56.477
NOT COOKED BUT IT'S GOT NINE

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:57.678
MONTHS TO GO IN IF I CAN'T GET

01:41:57.744 --> 01:41:59.346
IT DONE AND AND NINE MONTHS THEN

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:01.181
WILL SPILL OVER TO A TWO YEAR

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:01.415
SESSION.

01:42:01.482 --> 01:42:08.622
THAT'S THE NORM -- AND SO I I WE

01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:10.390
WERE DIFFERENT IN IN THAT SORT

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:10.757
OF OPINION IN.

01:42:10.824 --> 01:42:11.792
BUT I WANT TO SAY FIRST TO TO

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:13.293
BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AND THE

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:13.994
AUTHOR.

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:15.095
THAT I I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:15.929
SHORT TIME ABOUT FIVE YEARS.

01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:16.997
AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF HEATED

01:42:17.064 --> 01:42:18.732
DEBATES THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.367
HEATED DEBATES I SEEM WERE BOTH

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:22.769
SIDES OF CONDUCTED THEMSELVES.

01:42:22.836 --> 01:42:24.037
IN THE MOST PROFESSIONAL WAY.

01:42:24.104 --> 01:42:25.506
AND THE CONVERSATIONS ON BOTH

01:42:25.572 --> 01:42:27.341
SIDES OF BEEN LOUD BUT IN A VERY

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:28.876
CONSTRUCTIVE.

01:42:28.942 --> 01:42:33.313
POLICY ORIENTED WAY I NEVER

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.315
HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:42:35.382 --> 01:42:35.849
THAT THERE NEED THAT THAT

01:42:35.916 --> 01:42:36.650
DOESN'T NEED TO BE AND

01:42:36.717 --> 01:42:37.684
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:39.620
I'VE HEARD I'VE HEARD

01:42:39.686 --> 01:42:42.823
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE --

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:44.057
AM PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:45.459
AUTHOR ONCE AND I AGREE THERE

01:42:45.526 --> 01:42:47.828
NEEDS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO DO

01:42:47.895 --> 01:42:48.862
POLICING DRIVER LONG

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:52.399
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU -- ON HOW.

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:54.001
TO DIFFERENT SIDES CAN SEE THE

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.536
SAME LANGUAGE.

01:42:55.602 --> 01:42:57.304
AND TWO DIFFERENT SIDES SEE A

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:59.273
TOTALLY DIFFERENT OUTCOME.

01:42:59.339 --> 01:42:59.773
AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.674
CHALLENGING.

01:43:00.741 --> 01:43:01.708
BUT I DON'T THINK.

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.944
BECAUSE THAT SITUATION EXISTED

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:06.780
THE BILL NEEDS TO BE HELD.

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:07.381
IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE IN AND

01:43:07.447 --> 01:43:08.515
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:10.050
BECAUSE I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:11.318
IT SENDS OUT.

01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:12.686
IS THAT THIS IS NOT A SEARS

01:43:12.753 --> 01:43:13.754
ENOUGH ISSUE TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.455
AND I DO HAVE TRUST IN THE

01:43:15.522 --> 01:43:17.424
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I'VE BEEN

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:20.127
THERE BEFORE. TO ASK MEMBERS TO

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:20.994
HELP ME TO GET MY COMMITTEE OUT.

01:43:21.061 --> 01:43:22.796
OF MY BILLS OUT OF COMMITTEE AND

01:43:22.863 --> 01:43:24.698
I UP I HAVE SOME FAITH IN THE

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:28.902
SYSTEM -- THAT'LL BE A IS THAT

01:43:28.969 --> 01:43:30.170
THEY'LL BE A CONVERSATION.

01:43:30.237 --> 01:43:32.606
NO NO ONE HERE WANTS TO SEE AN

01:43:32.673 --> 01:43:34.141
OFFICER PART.

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:36.243
I'M PRETTY CERTAIN ABOUT THAT --

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:37.744
BUT NO ONE HERE ALSO WANTS TO

01:43:37.811 --> 01:43:38.679
SE.

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:40.681
ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO WHO IS

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:42.683
INNOCENT.

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.952
OR GUILTY HURT EITHER.

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:45.852
I MEAN LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:47.955
THAT AND I TRUST AND AND I TRUST

01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:49.056
IN THIS WEBER MY INTEREST IN

01:43:49.122 --> 01:43:50.557
THIS WEBER THAT SHE'S TAKEN A

01:43:50.624 --> 01:43:52.793
LOOK AT THIS -- AND THEY TAKE A

01:43:52.859 --> 01:43:54.461
LOOK AT THE END OF THE LANGUAGE

01:43:54.528 --> 01:43:55.963
AND ENSURING THAT THAT WE THAT

01:43:56.029 --> 01:43:57.030
WE DO.

01:43:57.097 --> 01:43:58.799
THAT THAT IT REFLECTS.

01:43:58.865 --> 01:43:59.967
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO NOT

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:01.301
TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:01.902
THAT AND THEIR ABILITY TO COME

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:02.903

AND TALK IN AND AND PROPOSE

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:08.942
LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS LIVE

01:44:09.009 --> 01:44:11.011
LEGITIMATE ISSUES.

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.279
NOT WANTING TO CHANGE IS ONE

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:12.512
THING.

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:13.380
AND WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE RIGHT

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:14.481
WE HAVE TO NUDGE FOLKS TO CHANGE

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:16.083
A LITTLE BIT.

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.717
WELL -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.385
DO UP HERE THAT'S WHAT

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:21.588
LEGISLATION DOES -- BUT WE WANT

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:22.556
TO DO IT RIGHT NOW I DON'T WANNA

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:23.056
THANK YOU LOOK I HAVE A

01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:23.357
DIFFERENT.

01:44:23.423 --> 01:44:25.626
PERSPECTIVE ON ON HOW I VIEW LAW

01:44:25.692 --> 01:44:27.761
ENFORCEMENT BASED ON THINGS THAT

01:44:27.828 --> 01:44:30.163
HAPPENED -- IN MY LIFE AND MOST

01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:33.200
RECENTLY -- WHAT WE'VE HEARD

01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:34.534
SITUATIONS OF PEOPLE BEING

01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:36.103
SCARED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT I I'VE

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:37.604
ALSO BEEN A SITUATION WERE

01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:39.673
RECENTLY I'VE SHARED WITH MOST

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.108
PEOPLE HERE PRIVATELY IT'S A

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:43.143
FIRST TIME ALL SHARE PUBLICLY --

I'D LIKE TO ATTEND THE BREAK INS

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:46.647
IN MY HOUSE.

01:44:46.713 --> 01:44:49.883
OF THE FIRST WHEN I WAS THERE --

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:51.618
AND FORTUNATELY THE PERSON

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:52.753
DIDN'T.

01:44:52.819 --> 01:44:54.821
MANAGE TO GET IN AND LAW

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.623
ENFORCEMENT CAME IN THEY WERE

01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:58.225
EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

01:44:58.291 --> 01:44:59.292
ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WHAT WOULD

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:00.994
HAPPEN TO THE RESPONSE TIME WAS

01:45:01.061 --> 01:45:02.095
A QUICK ENOUGH AND THE PERSON

01:45:02.162 --> 01:45:02.696
WAS NOT A SERIOUS THREAT BUT

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:04.398
THEY THEY GOT TO THE DOOR AND

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:06.299
THEY WERE STARTING TO DO WHAT

01:45:06.366 --> 01:45:07.367
THEY GOTTA DO AND I'M UPSTAIRS.

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:10.303
WITH MY KIDS BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:11.471
WHAT GOES ON YOUR MIND.

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:13.607
I NOT BEEN THERE.

01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:14.207
HAD HAD BEEN TWO HOURS LATER

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:16.276
MORE SLEEP [inaudible]

01:45:16.343 --> 01:45:17.811
EVERYTHING.

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:20.347
THAT YOU WOULD FOR YOUR LIFE.

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:20.914
FLASH BEFORE MY EYES IN THAT

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:22.149
MOMENT.

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:25.118
THE SECOND ATTEMPT TO BREAK IN --

01:45:25.185 --> 01:45:26.553
WAS A GOOD VIEW WEEKS AGO.

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.287
AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE KNOW

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:28.689
WITH THOSE ONE PERSON OR TWO

01:45:28.755 --> 01:45:32.192
PEOPLE AND AND AND IT WAS

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:35.128
TERRIFYING.

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:38.432
AND AND OBVIOUSLY I FLY UP HERE

01:45:38.498 --> 01:45:40.000
FOR WORK THAT'S NOT A SECRET.

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:40.534
FOR ANYBODY THINK THAT'S A

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.270
SECRET WHILE -- BUT I OFTEN

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:44.037
THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THAT

01:45:44.104 --> 01:45:44.638
HAPPENED AND YEAH I WAS ON THE

01:45:44.705 --> 01:45:46.306
PHONE [inaudible]

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:51.211
AND RAISING MY VOICE ASKING THEM

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:53.714
TO GET THERE SOONER AND QUICKER.

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:54.715
IN FIVE MINUTES.

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:56.683
IT'S NOT LIKE AN ETERNITY.

01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:58.618
AS I'M WAITING SIDE OF MY HOUSE

01:45:58.685 --> 01:45:59.786
AND MY WIFE IS UPSTAIRS LOCK IN

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:01.988
THE LOW OR PUTTING AS MUCH

01:46:02.055 --> 01:46:03.523
THINGS SHE CANNOT FOR THE DOOR.

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:05.058
NOW IT WASN'T AS BAD.

01:46:05.125 --> 01:46:07.294
AS AS I AM MAKING IT THE SOUND

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.563
ONCE WE HAD ALL THE FACTS.

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:13.100
BUT WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FAX.

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:15.769
ANYONE HERE WOULD BE TERRIFIED.

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:17.370
DID NOT KNOW WHAT THOSE ONE

01:46:17.437 --> 01:46:21.374
PERSON OR TWO PEOPLE OUTSIDE --

01:46:21.441 --> 01:46:22.442
AND FORTUNATELY FORTUNATELY

01:46:22.509 --> 01:46:24.177
NOTHING HAPPENED I RAN OUTSIDE

01:46:24.244 --> 01:46:25.278
WITH THE BATON THE REST OF IT I

01:46:25.345 --> 01:46:26.113
WILL.

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:28.048
I WILL CHAIR BECAUSE I I WAS ONE

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:28.682
OF THOSE GUYS THAT RULE WALKED

01:46:28.749 --> 01:46:30.550
OUTSIDE WITH ABOUT NOT KNOWING

01:46:30.617 --> 01:46:33.120
WHAT WAS GOING ON IT TO BE

01:46:33.186 --> 01:46:34.488
CONFRONTED -- ALSO BY LAW

01:46:34.554 --> 01:46:35.756
ENFORCEMENT.

01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:37.724
BUT THAT WAS THEIR JOB.

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:40.627
AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT TWO TWO

01:46:40.694 --> 01:46:42.028
DIFFERENT -- COMMANDS TO FIGURE

01:46:42.095 --> 01:46:44.898
OUT WHERE I WAS AT BUT I WAS A

01:46:44.965 --> 01:46:47.334
LITTLE BIT WORRIED AND IDEA

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:47.934
WASN'T THINKING RATIONALLY THE

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:53.373
TIME -- SO MY PERSPECTIVE ON

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:57.043
APPROACHING THIS -- IS

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:59.246
UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATION --

01:46:59.312 --> 01:47:01.782
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT'S HARD WORK.

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:03.083
AND THE SITUATIONS THEY OFTEN

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:04.785
PUT THEMSELVES IN -- TO PROTECT

01:47:04.851 --> 01:47:07.354
OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:08.655
AND AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:10.257
BUT EVEN HAVING SAID THAT I I I

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:11.424
STILL THINK.

01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:13.627
IT'S NECESSARY TO BOOK THIS BILL

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:14.161
OUT.

01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:15.729
EVIL DOES BILL OUT THAT DOES NOT

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:17.197
MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE RESPECT FOR

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:19.599
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:21.268
BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY I AM

01:47:21.334 --> 01:47:24.104
INTERPRETING THIS.

01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:25.906
BUT IT MEANS THAT THAT THIS IS

01:47:25.972 --> 01:47:27.274
AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:30.744
THE MOVE.

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:31.311
FOR AND ALL OF US HAVE BEEN

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:32.679
THERE THE WAR WILL HAVE TO SIT

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:34.281
DOWN AND WE'LL HAVE TO HAMMER

01:47:34.347 --> 01:47:35.949
OUT ANY ANY ANY [inaudible]

01:47:36.016 --> 01:47:37.617
POLICY DISCUSSIONS.

01:47:37.684 --> 01:47:38.685
THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN IN

01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:40.453
LANGUAGE AND THIS IS WHAT THE

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:46.259
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS DOES -- TO

AT THE END OF THE DAY -- GOOD

01:47:58.171 --> 01:47:59.906

AND HE TALKED ABOUT.

01:49:19.252 --> 01:49:20.587
SOMEONE DID HE WORK WITH OR IF

01:49:20.654 --> 01:49:22.155

01:49:27.627 --> 01:49:32.599
POINT WHERE HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:34.000
AND THEN I HEAR FROM MY

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:36.236
COLLEAGUE TO MY RIGHT.

01:49:36.303 --> 01:49:38.204

AND ABOUT JUST HAVING LAW

01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:44.978
ENFORCEMENT IN HER HOME.

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:51.051
AND WORRIED ABOUT HER FAMILY.

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:52.185
ESPECIALLY IS NOW AFTER AMERICAN

01:49:52.252 --> 01:49:53.687
MALE ALL RIGHT I CAN EMPATHIZE

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:54.487

WE'RE ALL TRYING TO TOUCH AND

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:07.267
THAT'S WHY IT'S IS RISEN TO THIS

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:08.601
LEVEL.

01:50:08.668 --> 01:50:10.637
BUT I HOPE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS

01:50:10.704 --> 01:50:12.038
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE HAVE

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:13.540
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS AND WE HAVE

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:15.475
TO GET THIS RESOLVED.

01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:18.645
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL TRAUMATIZED.

01:50:18.712 --> 01:50:20.013
WHEN AN OFFICER?

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.350
IS KILLED BY A CRIMINAL.

01:50:23.416 --> 01:50:27.020
THEY ARE TRAUMATIZED THE WHOLE.

01:50:27.087 --> 01:50:29.356
SECTOR THEY'RE TRAUMATIZED.

01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:31.758
AND IT HAS AN EFFECT ON HIM THAT

01:50:31.825 --> 01:50:33.493
I THINK SOMETIMES.

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.961
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:36.363

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:42.168
IN FACT IT IS PROBABLY.

01:50:42.235 --> 01:50:43.570
FROWNED UPON.

01:50:43.636 --> 01:50:44.738
ON BOTH OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:50:44.804 --> 01:50:46.873
I WILL NEED.

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.341
NO PART OF THIS DISCUSSION

01:50:48.408 --> 01:50:49.709
SHOULD BE ABOUT.

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.211
WHAT HAPPENS?

01:50:51.277 --> 01:50:53.146
AFTER THAT HAPPENS.

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:56.616
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. TO BOTH

01:50:56.683 --> 01:50:57.684
SIDES WHEN I AM HAVING THAT

01:50:57.751 --> 01:50:58.952
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO HEAL

01:50:59.019 --> 01:51:01.554
THAT COULD THAT IS PROBABLY WHAT

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:02.856
KEEPS THAT'S ST GETTING WORSE

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:04.657
AND WORSE.

01:51:04.724 --> 01:51:06.393
AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO RESET.

01:51:06.459 --> 01:51:08.395
THE CONVERSATION AS I BELIEVE IT

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:11.398
I HOPE AS WE MOVED OUT.

01:51:11.464 --> 01:51:13.166
OF THIS COMMITTEE TO WHERE WE

01:51:13.233 --> 01:51:14.267
CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SOME

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:15.902
SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS ON HOW

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:17.537
WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.

01:51:17.604 --> 01:51:20.373
ON TO RESOLVE THIS -- I'M

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.778
LOOKING AT PAGE.

01:51:24.844 --> 01:51:25.779
THREE SEE WHERE SAYS NEITHER

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:28.181

01:51:28.248 --> 01:51:28.982
NINETY SEVEN PROVIDE A PEACE

01:51:29.049 --> 01:51:30.116

MANSLAUGHTER IN VIOLATION OF

01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:34.421
SECTION. ONE NINETY TWO IF THAT

01:51:34.487 --> 01:51:35.388
PERSON WAS KILLED DUE TO THE

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:37.190
CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT CONDUCT OF

01:51:37.257 --> 01:51:39.159
THE OFFICER INCLUDING SITUATIONS

01:51:39.225 --> 01:51:40.760
IN WHICH THE VICTIM IS A PERSON.

01:51:40.827 --> 01:51:42.262
OTHER THAN THE PERSON THAT THE

01:51:42.328 --> 01:51:43.963
OFFICER WAS SEEKING TO ARREST

01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:45.865

CREATED BY THE PEACE OFFICERS

01:51:51.771 --> 01:51:53.540
CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE.

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.542
I DON'T THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:56.910
MEANS.

01:51:56.976 --> 01:51:58.545

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:02.115
BECAUSE THEY HAD TO MAKE A SPLIT

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:05.452
SECOND DECISION.

01:52:05.518 --> 01:52:07.454
THAT WE CAN'T JUDGE A CRIMINAL

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:08.621
ACT.

01:52:08.688 --> 01:52:10.657

IF YOU NEED TO BE SOME

01:52:15.328 --> 01:52:18.031
CLARIFYING LANGUAGE. TO ENSURE

SPONSOR YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT --

03:09:05.067 --> 03:09:06.134
IS THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO

03:09:06.201 --> 03:09:08.370
INTO THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER

03:09:08.437 --> 03:09:10.072
NOT YOU GOING TO DO A BILL.

03:09:10.138 --> 03:09:11.373
THAT'S BROUGHT TO YOU BY A COULD

03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:14.276
A COALITION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

03:09:14.342 --> 03:09:15.777
WANT TO BRING CHANGE.

03:09:15.844 --> 03:09:17.979
I'VE HAD MANY THOUGHTS ABOUT NOT

03:09:18.046 --> 03:09:19.281
DOING THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS A

03:09:19.347 --> 03:09:20.816
DIFFICULT BILL AND IT IS TAKING

03:09:20.882 --> 03:09:23.785
ITS TOLL CLEARLY ON MY STAFF.

03:09:23.852 --> 03:09:25.353
ON ON ME AND ON MY FAMILY.

03:09:25.420 --> 03:09:26.855
OF WHEN YOU'RE VILIFIED AND YOU

03:09:26.922 --> 03:09:27.823
TALKED ABOUT IN THE IN THE

03:09:27.889 --> 03:09:29.224
MANNER IN WHICH IT IS NOT

03:09:29.291 --> 03:09:31.727
ACCEPTABLE AND IS NOT REFLECTIVE

03:09:31.793 --> 03:09:32.728
OF WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON.

03:09:32.794 --> 03:09:34.196
AND SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

03:09:34.262 --> 03:09:35.163
TRY TO BRING CHANGE IN

03:09:35.230 --> 03:09:36.565
CALIFORNIA I KNOW THAT AND IT'S

03:09:36.631 --> 03:09:38.400
DIFFICULT TO SPONSOR THESE BILLS

03:09:38.467 --> 03:09:39.634
AND TRY TO EXPLAIN TO OTHERS HOW

03:09:39.701 --> 03:09:41.470
YOU FEEL.

03:09:41.536 --> 03:09:42.904
I'M OFTEN REMINDED OF THE MOVIE

03:09:42.971 --> 03:09:44.840
A TIME TO KILL.

03:09:44.906 --> 03:09:46.374
WHEN AT THE VERY END THE LAWYER

03:09:46.441 --> 03:09:47.909
GAVE ITS SCENARIO OF WHAT

03:09:47.976 --> 03:09:49.177
HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG GIRL AND

03:09:49.244 --> 03:09:50.946
HE SAID CLOSE YOUR EYES AND

03:09:51.012 --> 03:09:52.981
IMAGINE SHE WAS WHITE?

03:09:53.048 --> 03:09:53.782
AND THAT'S KIND OF THE WAY

03:09:53.849 --> 03:09:54.916
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP

03:09:54.983 --> 03:09:56.351
FOLKS UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE

03:09:56.418 --> 03:09:59.154
TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY. FOR OVER

03:09:59.221 --> 03:09:59.988
THREE HUNDRED OVER FOUR HUNDRED

03:10:00.055 --> 03:10:01.490
YEARS NOW AND STILL FIND

03:10:01.556 --> 03:10:02.924
YOURSELF.

03:10:02.991 --> 03:10:04.993
ONCE AGAIN UNFAIRLY TREATED

OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF BIAS.

03:10:07.796 --> 03:10:10.098
BUT CLEARLY OF DISCOVERING THAT

03:10:10.165 --> 03:10:11.700
THE NUMBERS THAT TALK ABOUT THE

03:10:11.767 --> 03:10:13.702
DEATH OF UNARMED AFRICAN

03:10:13.769 --> 03:10:15.537
AMERICAN AND LATINO MALES IS

03:10:15.604 --> 03:10:17.239
TRULY OUT OF PROPORTION. TO

03:10:17.305 --> 03:10:19.074
THEIR POSITION IN THE SOCIETY IN

03:10:19.141 --> 03:10:20.475
TERMS OF THE NUMBERS.

03:10:20.542 --> 03:10:22.144
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A

03:10:22.210 --> 03:10:23.745
PASSPORT FOR CHANGE.

03:10:23.812 --> 03:10:25.814
THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY WE

03:10:25.881 --> 03:10:28.383
HOPE PUT ANY OFFICER AT HARM

03:10:28.450 --> 03:10:29.951
THAT IS NOT THE INTENT.

03:10:30.018 --> 03:10:31.553
IS TO ONCE AGAIN ADDRESS THE

03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:33.655
CRITICAL ISSUES WE FACE IN THIS

03:10:33.722 --> 03:10:35.190
NATION FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS.

03:10:35.257 --> 03:10:36.625
OF HOW WE TREAT OTHERS WHO DON'T

03:10:36.691 --> 03:10:38.126
LOOK LIKE US.

03:10:38.193 --> 03:10:39.795
AND HOW THEY FEEL SOMETIMES

03:10:39.861 --> 03:10:41.329
BEING UNFAIRLY TREATED.

03:10:41.396 --> 03:10:42.631
IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT MY

03:10:42.697 --> 03:10:44.132
COMMUNITY DOES NOT FEEL

03:10:44.199 --> 03:10:46.268
ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED BY LAW

03:10:46.334 --> 03:10:47.536
FOR BLOOD WORK IN THE IN THE

03:10:47.602 --> 03:10:48.970
READING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:10:49.037 --> 03:10:50.639
IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT WHEN THEY

03:10:50.705 --> 03:10:52.107
CALL THE POLICE OFFICERS THEY

03:10:52.174 --> 03:10:53.875
ARE AFRAID MUCH MORE FOOD NOT

03:10:53.942 --> 03:10:55.043
ONLY WHAT IS OUTSIDE THAT

03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:56.077
THEY'RE FIGHTING BUT WHAT

03:10:56.144 --> 03:10:58.613
THEY'VE MADE EXPERIENCE ONCE A

03:10:58.680 --> 03:10:59.347
PERSON'S ARRIVE.

03:10:59.414 --> 03:11:00.816
I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT MY

03:11:00.882 --> 03:11:02.551
COMMUNITY OFTEN ON REPRESENTED

03:11:02.617 --> 03:11:04.052
ADEQUATELY IF YOU CAN BE FROM

03:11:04.119 --> 03:11:06.421
THE SUPPORT OF POLICE DEPARTMENT.

03:11:06.488 --> 03:11:07.422
IN OTHER WORDS THEY SHOULD BE

03:11:07.489 --> 03:11:08.623
ABLE TO CALL THEIR POLICE AND

03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:09.925
KNOW THAT WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY

03:11:09.991 --> 03:11:11.893
GOING TO GET GOOD SERVICE.

03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:12.527
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE TREATED

03:11:12.594 --> 03:11:13.762
FAIRLY.

03:11:13.829 --> 03:11:15.263
AND THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.

03:11:15.330 --> 03:11:16.832
THIS BILL I HOPE STRIKES A

03:11:16.898 --> 03:11:19.034
BALANCE CLEARLY THERE WERE THOSE

03:11:19.100 --> 03:11:19.601
WHO WANTED THINGS FAR MORE

03:11:19.668 --> 03:11:20.869
EXTREME.

03:11:20.936 --> 03:11:22.671
IT IS NOT DESIGNED IN ANY WAY TO

03:11:22.737 --> 03:11:24.239
VICTIMIZE ANYONE.

03:11:24.306 --> 03:11:25.807
BUT IT IS DESIGNED TO CHANGE THE

03:11:25.874 --> 03:11:27.008
CULTURE OF POLICING IN

03:11:27.075 --> 03:11:27.976
CALIFORNIA.

03:11:28.043 --> 03:11:29.744
SO THE WE ARRIVE AT A SITUATION

03:11:29.811 --> 03:11:31.546
WHERE WE ARE TO PUT IN EVERY

03:11:31.613 --> 03:11:33.048
INDIVIDUAL IS ARE TREATED WITH

03:11:33.114 --> 03:11:34.416
RESPECT.

03:11:34.482 --> 03:11:36.117
AND THAT WE RESPECT LIFE.

03:11:36.184 --> 03:11:37.586
THAT WE RESPECT LIFE AND THAT IS

03:11:37.652 --> 03:11:38.787
SO IMPORTANT.

03:11:38.854 --> 03:11:40.722
I HAVE NEVER MET PEOPLE MORE

03:11:40.789 --> 03:11:42.390
PAINFULLY HURT THAN THOSE WHO IN

03:11:42.457 --> 03:11:43.892
THIS AUDIENCE.

03:11:43.959 --> 03:11:45.627
IT IS MADE ME KEENLY AWARE OF

03:11:45.694 --> 03:11:48.029
JUST HOW DEEP AND HOW HARD THE

03:11:48.096 --> 03:11:49.564
PAIN IS WHEN PEOPLE DON'T

03:11:49.631 --> 03:11:50.198
BELIEVE THIS BEEN FAIRNESS AND

03:11:50.265 --> 03:11:51.199
JUSTICE.

03:11:51.266 --> 03:11:52.367
NOT JUST THE LOSS OF AN

03:11:52.434 --> 03:11:53.668
INDIVIDUAL BUT THE METHOD IN

03:11:53.735 --> 03:11:55.070
WHICH IT THEY'VE BEEN LOST.

03:11:55.136 --> 03:11:56.304
AND I THINK YOU CAN STILL FEEL

03:11:56.371 --> 03:11:58.506
THE PAIN THAT'S THEIR FROM FIVE

03:11:58.573 --> 03:12:00.008
AND SIX AND TEN AND TWELVE YEARS

03:12:00.075 --> 03:12:01.810
OF MOTHERS AND NIECES AND

03:12:01.877 --> 03:12:03.211
NEPHEWS AND COUSINS WHO LOST

03:12:03.278 --> 03:12:04.312
INDIVIDUALS.

03:12:04.379 --> 03:12:05.647
WHO DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY GOT

03:12:05.714 --> 03:12:07.515
THE FOR YOUR SHEER OF WHAT TOOK

03:12:07.582 --> 03:12:07.983
PLACE?

03:12:08.049 --> 03:12:09.651
THIS IS NOT DESIGNED TO ONCE

03:12:09.718 --> 03:12:11.353
AGAIN TO HEAD PAMPER OUR POLICE

03:12:11.419 --> 03:12:14.122
OFFICERS FROM DOING THEIR JOBS.

03:12:14.189 --> 03:12:15.690
WE NEED THEM TO DO THEIR JOB.

03:12:15.757 --> 03:12:17.125
BUT IT IS TO SET A STANDARD IN A

03:12:17.192 --> 03:12:19.027
BAR FOR PRACTICE AND TRAINING

03:12:19.094 --> 03:12:20.896
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY ARRIVALS AT

03:12:20.962 --> 03:12:22.197
A CONCLUSION BUT WE WILL HAVE

03:12:22.264 --> 03:12:23.832
FEW INDIVIDUALS HARMED AND NOT

03:12:23.899 --> 03:12:24.766
MORE.

03:12:24.833 --> 03:12:26.101
IT IS NOT OUR INTENT TO SPEND

03:12:26.167 --> 03:12:27.135
OUR TIME TALKING ABOUT

03:12:27.202 --> 03:12:29.337
PROSECUTING OFFICERS BUT HOW DO

03:12:29.404 --> 03:12:30.672
WE PREVENT THE UNFORTUNATE

03:12:30.739 --> 03:12:35.176
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE SEE EVERY

03:12:35.243 --> 03:12:36.044
DAY IN CALIFORNIA.

03:12:36.111 --> 03:12:37.145
I SPEAK TO YOU AS A MEMBER OF

03:12:37.212 --> 03:12:37.746
THIS ASSEMBLY IN MOST OF YOU

03:12:37.812 --> 03:12:38.914

NOT ONLY AT THIS ASSEMBLY BUT

03:12:43.718 --> 03:12:45.186
THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE AS AN

03:12:45.253 --> 03:12:46.821

03:12:46.888 --> 03:12:47.822
SAN DIEGO STATE.

03:12:47.889 --> 03:12:49.157
BUT I'VE STUDIED THE HISTORY OF

THIS COUNTRY.

03:13:17.419 --> 03:13:18.687
AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO

03:13:18.753 --> 03:13:20.889
MALES ARE BEING SHOT MORE THAN

PITCHES MOTIONS IT SIMPLY TAKES

03:43:21.154 --> 03:43:21.988
TOO LONG.

03:43:22.055 --> 03:43:23.123
IT DOESN'T EXCESSIVELY LONG

03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:24.791
NOTICE REQUIREMENT OF SIXTEEN

03:43:24.858 --> 03:43:26.392

03:43:29.028 --> 03:43:29.963
NOTICE.

03:43:30.029 --> 03:43:31.197
A DIFFERENCE OF SIXTIES MIGHT

03:43:31.264 --> 03:43:32.932
NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH TO YOU BUT

03:43:32.999 --> 03:43:34.367
TO SOMEBODY WHO'S SITTING IN

03:43:34.434 --> 03:43:36.269
JAIL ON A MISDEMEANOR CASE.

03:43:36.336 --> 03:43:38.505
THAT'S A CRITICAL AMOUNT OF TIME.

03:43:38.571 --> 03:43:39.572
THAT'S BECAUSE A PERSON WHO'S

03:43:39.639 --> 03:43:40.640
CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR ALSO

03:43:40.707 --> 03:43:41.541

03:43:45.645 --> 03:43:46.946
SO BY REDUCING THE NOTICE PERIOD

03:43:47.013 --> 03:43:47.781

03:43:47.847 --> 03:43:49.415

03:43:49.983 --> 03:43:51.284
IT WILL MAKE IT MORE IN LINE

03:43:51.351 --> 03:43:52.085
WITH ALL THE OTHER CRIMINAL

03:43:52.152 --> 03:43:53.553

ACTUALLY FILE THESE MOTIONS

03:43:57.223 --> 03:43:58.625
WITHOUT WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A

03:43:58.691 --> 03:44:00.160
SPEEDY TRIAL.

03:44:00.226 --> 03:44:00.693
THIS CHANGE IN THE NOTICE

03:44:00.760 --> 03:44:02.028
REQUIREMENT WILL PROVIDE THOSE

03:44:02.095 --> 03:44:03.596

03:44:03.663 --> 03:44:05.632
MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY

03:44:05.698 --> 03:44:06.399

03:44:06.466 --> 03:44:07.300
PROCEDURE.

03:44:07.367 --> 03:44:08.401
AND THAT WILL RESULT IN MORE

03:44:08.468 --> 03:44:10.837
TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS AND

03:44:10.904 --> 03:44:11.404
WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

03:44:11.471 --> 03:44:12.138

CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE

03:44:15.642 --> 03:44:16.943
PROPER TOOLS ARE ALREADY THERE

03:44:17.010 --> 03:44:17.811
BUT IF THEY COME TO USE THEIR

03:44:17.877 --> 03:44:19.379
NOT ACCESSIBLE THEY'RE NOT

03:44:19.445 --> 03:44:19.979
HELPING PEOPLE.

03:44:20.046 --> 03:44:21.881
SO I'LL LEAVE MY COMMENTS THERE
