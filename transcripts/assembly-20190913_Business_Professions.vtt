scientific support that

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.469

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:24.536
in order to correct mild to

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:28.474

online without rocking with the

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:39.017
doctor that's simply not true

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:40.152
that's always the case that

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.654
we do our California patients

life sentence reviews are file

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:07.079

they're a candidate or not

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.217
twenty percent or so of the

patients that are reviewed

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:14.720
are not exactly because

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:17.256
they simply require review

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:18.557
more of what the doctor

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:21.159
-- more aggressive someone

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:23.495
asked for more information

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:25.063
one scene in the file they

having already had enough sugar

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:10.976
-- so so what I was saying

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.144
is in the tradition while

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.012

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.963
will calculation state

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:33.265
my industry so the exact same

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:34.967
product from mild to moderate

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.468
she could for under nineteen

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.469
hundred dollars across the

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:39.404
board three individuals and

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.739
roll areas specifically in

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:41.907
California and cannot get

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:44.710
access to the dentist usually

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.278
for at all number of people

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:47.846
who simply cannot afford five

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.681
thousand dollars or more we

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:51.316
can change lives we do change

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:54.252
lives this is a customer by

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:55.887
road us actually two causes of

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.322
like running last week that I

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:59.091
thought what's showing we're

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:01.426
sharing with you that about

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:02.928
thirty seconds left right

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:04.363
five thank you very much my

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:05.631
daughter's an actual patient

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:06.765
she gets polluted schools

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:08.467
and attempted suicide your to

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:10.335
these factors your help means

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.270
the world you're giving her

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:16.141
confidence with their lives

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.809
the bill supporting the city

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:19.244
eight because it comes you

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:21.113
based on potentially some other

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:23.081
motives and that are ready

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.883
to take way mazing service

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.253
California -- recalling the

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.955
mystery as an option probably

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:31.289
is now have opposite in

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:32.958
otherwise not worth noting

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:33.992
in two thousand twelve the

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.427
FDA for the record we do

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:37.295
the prescription radiology

00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:39.765
clinicians never before as any

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:42.901
state mandated use radiology

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.102
specially not only a few

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:45.270
minutes now this bill would

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:47.039
require that -- regardless

00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:48.073
of whether the medically

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.842
necessary -- or not this is

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:52.577
not about patient safety this

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.379
is about competition you know

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:55.947
that everything they do to

00:21:56.014 --> 00:21:56.948
make the choice harder for

00:21:57.015 --> 00:21:58.717
Californians to protect you

00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:00.118
one step closer to keeping call

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:01.787
dentistry matching making them

00:22:01.853 --> 00:22:03.722
quickly considering making up

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:05.757
compete for lowering prices

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:08.927
and we're doing the right thing

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.362
my suggestion is to push

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:12.097
this language for your heart

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:13.598
industries suggested that come

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:14.666
to the table and help create a

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:16.635
policy that protects consumers

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:17.636
will give them choices I

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:18.770
believe and the industry

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.138
believes the regulations

00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:22.374
important that consumer

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.009
protection important patient

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:25.911
protections important and we

00:22:25.977 --> 00:22:28.313
should get a table for that the

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.648
legislative computer wrapped

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:33.585
up with right -- without the

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:35.420
legislation we're here to study

00:22:35.487 --> 00:22:36.521
its impact on public health

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:38.023
and safety job losses in the

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.057
practice of dentistry as a

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:41.126
whole in the interim I taking

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.894
this suggestion thank you for

00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:44.062
your time and their work in

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:45.764
your service thank you for your

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:48.734
testimony any other members

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.268
the public opposition right

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:51.570
sure number for each and then

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:52.904
went back that respectfully

00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:54.806
here in opposition today and

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:56.241
having good oral health and a

00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:57.609
smile that you can be confident

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.211
with is no small thing and

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:01.146
college I three technologies

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:02.848
in California are growing part

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:04.483
of making that people call for

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.752
all for more people -- every

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:08.687
day -- when this bill was in

00:23:08.754 --> 00:23:10.455
the Senate we did ask -- as

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:11.623
my colleague mentioned for a

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.358
one year delay in the policy

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:14.526
provisions that are included

00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:15.627
in the sense that bill we

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:16.461
thought that that would have

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.563
given -- this legislature and

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.165
the stakeholders including our

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.033
industry and that is the proper

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.301
time to figure out if this

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:24.569
is an appropriate policy to

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:25.904
move forward from the Taliban

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:28.840
street -- in California we

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:30.208
did ask for that we continue

00:23:30.275 --> 00:23:31.209
to believe that that would

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:32.377
be the appropriate approach

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:34.746
understanding that for your

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:36.548
Gen -- but we do want to

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:37.883
make sure that will be for

00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:38.984
understand that this is an

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.887
industry manager because five

00:23:41.953 --> 00:23:45.624
access lower -- and so we need

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.725
to make sure that are moving

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.727
policies like this -- forward

00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:49.995
that we're doing in a way that

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:51.363
will continue allow consumers

00:23:51.429 --> 00:23:56.234
to access this in California

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:58.103
Mr turn members asking

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.471
public affairs on the

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:04.042
house don't recognize

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:10.048
everyone else in opposition

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:13.051
I am actually here on

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:18.023
these are a little bit late

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.357
there are also support or

00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:21.993
opposition Barbara Bettcher too

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.796
many questions because it's a

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:26.598
question for you the opponents

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:28.500
is I understand that I heard

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:30.235
size model moderate -- what

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.369
the Dante there never case

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:32.938
for this is used for severe

00:24:33.004 --> 00:24:35.507
issues it's not that they the

00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:37.742
clinician so because the state

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:40.445
certified licensed doctor --

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:43.248
this size and shape -- and in

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.483
our case about one out of five

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.918
or turned away because they're

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:47.953
fifties again within the

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:50.555
conditions one of you -- but

00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:52.591
no these a workers to the shops

00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:53.525
and for more severe things

00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:54.759
are needed going to break

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:57.562
in order -- if they are not

00:24:57.629 --> 00:24:59.497
accepted by that Dr -- there's

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:01.066
many examples of that and not

00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:02.033
just based on the aggressive

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.768
nature of art also based on

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:06.738
their medical and dental --

00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:10.308
five surveys and one official

00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:12.677
so in summary we're not the

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:14.246
support we're not supporting

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:18.149
-- more than mild moderate

00:25:18.216 --> 00:25:20.085
senator Lynch as usual at

00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:21.186
the head start which again

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:23.154
health regions nation we

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:24.322
respectfully disagree with

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:27.859
that -- characterization like

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:29.561
many complacent detail wars

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:31.429
you see in the better business

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.365
bureau receive because in

00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:35.834
fact not review or looking he

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:38.236
only imagine how was number of

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:40.972
cases where they were assigned

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.540
it is a line with a had

00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:45.143
severe or don't your problems

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.178
they don't look this year

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:49.180
Sonora they refuse actually

00:25:49.247 --> 00:25:50.148
so they can't come to the

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:53.451
conclusion that that which is

00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:54.853
and for the online providers

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.421
are children ever applied

00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:58.156
for customers no they're

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:01.493
not -- they the okay I think

00:26:01.559 --> 00:26:02.661
it is as a ministry for

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.362
treating the patients all

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:06.398
third goal three -- to be in

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:08.366
consideration and then at that

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:10.735
point couple reviews which

00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:12.003
happens at different ages

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.073
-- typically in the future

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:15.974
it is the product that I

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:20.779
thought we were no it's not

00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:22.847
thanks Richard okay any other

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:26.051
questions assembly where motion

00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:27.452
a second for the testimony

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:29.321
was that correct correct okay

00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:31.056
-- Mister will draw closer

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:32.190
they just want to I think

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.992
-- colleagues fire at their

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:35.827
house minutes support on the

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:38.496
sunset of this board -- and

00:26:38.563 --> 00:26:39.531
the test me that you're heard

00:26:39.597 --> 00:26:41.366
is very specific to consumer

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.767
protections that we want we

00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:45.437
will not remove -- the doctor

00:26:45.503 --> 00:26:46.738
from the conversation when we

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.206
are moving bone and that is

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:49.207
the consumer protection that

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.775
we have in place and so you'll

00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:52.377
see a number of different --

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:53.578
conversations with respect

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:54.980
this issue moving forward

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.481
and the coming years -- but I

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:58.116
appreciate your acknowledgement

00:26:58.183 --> 00:26:59.484
in consideration yet again

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:01.419
so respect the abstract the

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:03.021
effort will call the roll AB

sensible for court reporters

of the ones he appreciate --

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:01.446
the attention to something

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:02.914
that a lot of people don't

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:06.684
focus on that thanks very much

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:09.521

a non will bring back committee

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.227
questions I missed a lot

00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:17.162
actually the question about

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:19.798
this just briefly -- one even

00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:20.999
knows the bill's prevents

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:21.866
the board from issuing a

00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:23.334
certificate for the practice

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:24.469
of shorthand reporting by

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.837
means of voice reading of voice

00:28:25.904 --> 00:28:28.540
recognition technology can you

00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:29.874
tell us why that was put in the

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:32.644
bill -- to believe that there's

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.279
some of the stakeholders --

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:36.648
had -- spoken specific to this

00:28:36.714 --> 00:28:38.249
is the issue at hand to hand

00:28:38.316 --> 00:28:39.851
which some of the technologies

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:41.019
and the utilization of what's

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:42.420
currently in existence but as

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:43.888
you've heard -- we're continue

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:45.423
to working with many of the

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.891
stakeholders and figure out a

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:47.992
way to some the best practices

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:49.694
that work for them -- similarly

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:51.162
as well too so -- this was

00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:52.564
in a specific responsible we

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.631
had heard from many of the

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:54.866
different stakeholders okay I

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:56.034
just wanna make sure that we're

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:57.769
not preventing the industry

00:28:57.836 --> 00:28:59.370
from adopting practices that

00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:01.506
make them more efficient --

00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:03.508
so are is this a conversation

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:04.542
or to continue to have yes

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:05.477
most certainly and that is a

00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:06.945
commitment that out you can

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.980
make as well that's one the

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:11.549
other questions the ocean

second restored like close

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.019
respect that type of card will

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.588
call the roll AB fifteen twenty

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:17.822
motion Senate amendments to be

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:20.325
