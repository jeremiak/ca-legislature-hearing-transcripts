EXPANSIONS FOR EXAMPLE. WE

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:46.136

FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.311
PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:28.913
DISQUALIFIED WHEN YOU REFER TO

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:30.614
THE EXPANSION PACKAGE YOU MEAN

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:32.283

WE ESTIMATE FOR BOTH HOUSES THE

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.297
TOTAL COST IS AT THE EXPANSION

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:47.665

AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO.

00:42:58.642 --> 00:43:02.746
AND SO MY QUESTION IS. WHEN YOU

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:03.113
LOOK AT THE.

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:06.250
THE APPROACH THE TWO HOUSES OF

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:07.785
TAKE IN AND ATTEMPTING TO

00:43:07.851 --> 00:43:10.287
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR.

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:12.957
UNDOCUMENTED.

00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:14.158
FELT CALIFORNIANS.

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:16.860
I KNOW UCLA HAS DONE AN

00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:19.229
ANALYSIS THE COST ANALYSIS NOT

00:43:19.296 --> 00:43:21.665
ONLY FOR THE COVERAGE BUT.

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:25.369
THE COSTS FOR PROVIDING CARE.

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:27.571
THROUGH E. R. OR OTHER MEASURES.

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:30.240
TO THESE TWO POPULATIONS SO IT

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:32.276
GEEK IN THE LA OUR ANYONE.

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.011
.

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:35.512
RESPOND TO I GUESS WE YOU KNOW

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.047
WHAT'S NOT WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:38.515
IS THE COST OF EXPANDING

00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:41.118
COVERAGE WHAT IS NOT HERE AN

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:43.087
APPARENT TO US. ARE THE REAL

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:45.155
COSTS WE ALL BEAR BY NOT

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:48.025
PROVIDING COVERAGE TO THIS

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:49.360
RESIDENT POPULATION

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:51.228
SO COULD WE TALK ABOUT THAT A

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:52.496
LITTLE BIT I THINK IT JUST GIVES

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:54.365
US. A FRAME OF REFERENCE ARE

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.033
FRAMEWORK BY WHICH TO HAVE

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.067
THE BROADER CONVERSATION BECAUSE

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.036
IT'S NOT AS IF.

00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:00.904
IT DOESN'T COST US ALL

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.139
TODAY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:02.639
PROVIDED.

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:06.510
COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE.

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:08.145
WOULD KNOW JUST A FEW THINGS

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:08.512
FIRST.

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:09.546
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:11.115
CURRENTLY DOES PROVIDE FUNDING

00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:12.116
FOR CERTAIN EMERGENCY IN

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:13.450
PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES FOR

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:15.352
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.

00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:17.087
THOSE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE NOW

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:17.388
AND.

00:44:17.454 --> 00:44:18.889
I BELIEVE ESTIMATES THAT ARE

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:20.324
BEFORE YOU FOR THE EXPANSION

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:21.658
PROPOSAL REFLECT

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:23.527
THE CONTINUATION OF THOSE FUNDS

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:24.161
IN THE FUTURE.

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.996
I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:28.232
ABOUT IS HE POSSIBILITY THAT

00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:29.867
EXPANDING COVERAGE TO THESE.

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.668
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WOULD

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:32.302
REDUCE.

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.538
CERTAIN STATE COSTS RELATED TO

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:36.073
CARE IN EMERGENCY ROOMS.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.408
THOSE.

00:44:37.474 --> 00:44:39.977
ARE CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:42.079
HOWEVER AND THERE DIFFICULT TO

00:44:42.146 --> 00:44:43.313
ESTIMATE AND.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.483
LIKELY WOULD OCCUR OVER TIME

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.619
AND NOT NECESSARILY AND IN THE

00:44:48.685 --> 00:44:49.720
IMMEDIATE FUTURE.

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:51.221
BUT BUT CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE

00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:52.222
THAT THAT THAT IS A POSSIBILITY

00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:52.923
THAT.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:54.992
INCREASED ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.360
CARE COULD IN SOME CASES.

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:58.695
RESULT IN AVOIDING OTHER COSTS

00:44:58.762 --> 00:45:00.097
I'M AT THE SAME TIME SOME

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.098
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TIME

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:02.666
INCREASED ACCESS TO HEALTH

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:04.535
COVERAGE AND INTACT INCREASES

00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:07.738
UTILIZATION. WHICH AT COULD BE A

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:08.338
GOOD THING AGAIN IN THE LONGER

00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:09.073
RUN.

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:10.307
BUT IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:11.408
TELL ON THE NEAR TERM BECAUSE

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:12.609
THE ASSUMPTION IS WE'RE WE'RE

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:14.645
IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES SO.

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:16.880
THAT MY COSTS DON'T WHAT WERE WE

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:18.315
ABLE WHEN WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:19.983
WITH REGARD TO UNDOCUMENTED

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.020
CHILDREN LACK HERE WERE WE ABLE

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:24.121
TO IDENTIFY.

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:27.591
I'M COSTS THAT THE STATE HAD TO

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:29.493
BEAR PRIOR TO.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.129
PROVIDING FULL SCOPE COVERAGE.

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:32.996
WERE WE ABLE TO DO IT FOR THAT

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:35.165
POPULATION.

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:36.500
I I GUESS AMASSING GOES ON.

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:37.835
SO ME BASING RESPONSE MY

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:39.103
EXPECTATION IS NOT REASONABLE

00:45:39.169 --> 00:45:40.671
TERMS WOULD JUST

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:43.140
ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE COSTS.

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:44.875
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY ESTIMATE OF

00:45:44.942 --> 00:45:48.078
THAT. SO THE UNDERSEA DEPARTMENT

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:49.046
FINANCE SO WE WE WE DO ACTUALLY

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:50.781
ACCOUNT FOR THE PROGRAM AS IT

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:52.049
RUNS TODAY AND SO WE'VE GOT A

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:53.717
RESTRICTED SCOPE PROGRAM IN

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:54.985
WHICH WE DO GET SOME FEDERAL

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:56.587
FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY PREGNANCY

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:57.821
SERVICES.

00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:59.623
AND WHAT WE BASICALLY ASSUMES

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.792
THAT THAT OLD PROGRAM GOES AWAY

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:02.893
SO WE COUNT FOR ALL OF THE

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.461
SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:06.430
THEN THE NEW PROGRAM IN WHICH

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:07.698
THERE'S YOU KNOW I'M MORE STATE

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:09.299
ONLY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:11.869
AND SO. THAT ANALYSIS IS DONE WE

00:46:11.935 --> 00:46:13.804
SCORED THESE FISCAL'S AND AND AS

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:14.771
WELL AS FOR THE SP SEVENTY FIVE

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.940
WILSHIRE.

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:18.609
YOU'RE.

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:20.557
THE FULL SCOPE FOR THE OVER

SIXTY FIVE POPULATION ARE

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:24.127
ALREADY ENROLLED IN WHAT'S KNOWN

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:26.063

HEALTHCARE COSTS PAID FOR WERE

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.375
OUR MAIN BUT SEPARATE AND APART

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:39.776
FROM THAT IF THEY SHOW UP.

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:41.478

AND AFTER WHICH THEY COULD GAIN

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.486
RESTRICTED SCOPE COVERAGE AND

00:50:22.552 --> 00:50:24.955

YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THROUGH

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.782
THESE VARIOUS PROPOSALS OUTREACH

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:50.117
WHEN I DO THINKING ABOUT

01:39:50.184 --> 01:39:50.617
STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS.

01:39:50.684 --> 01:39:51.819

WE THINK WHAT ONE APPROACH YOU

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:04.631
COULD TAKE IS TO FIND A MORE

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:06.266

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:07.334
ACTION THAT BOTH HOUSES TAKE

THOUGH THEY DO IT THROUGH FOR

01:40:08.202 --> 01:40:10.437
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:11.271
THAT THAT WOULD BE THEM MOST

01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:12.272
DIRECT WAY TO ADDRESS CAPACITY

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:13.440

AN AREA WHERE ACTUALLY THERE IS

01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.657
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:05.325

01:41:05.392 --> 01:41:07.027
THE SENATE ON. INVESTING

CARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.565
ALTHOUGH WE EACH DID IT IN

01:41:11.632 --> 01:41:13.300
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:15.169
I WOULD KNOW THAT MOST OF THESE

01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:15.969
ARE REALLY A QUESTION OF OUR

01:41:16.036 --> 01:41:17.504

ADMINISTRATION INCLUDED FIFTY

01:41:30.184 --> 01:41:31.318
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND

PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY SLOTS AND

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:35.055
THE REASON FOR THE MINISTRATION

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:36.323
THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:38.025
IS THAT WE HAVE SOME STATISTICS

01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:39.226

THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:51.805
THE REASON THAT SIGNIFICANT IS

01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:53.440
BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM NATIONAL

01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:56.210

THERE WOULD BE BETWEEN FIFTY

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.511

GOVERNOR'S NEW PROPOSAL AND NOW

01:55:56.649 --> 01:55:58.017
JUST IF I CAN JUMP TO JUST A FEW

01:55:58.084 --> 01:55:58.785
COMMENTS.

01:55:58.851 --> 01:56:00.953
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE WE FIND

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.021
THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:04.524
OVERLAP BETWEEN THE SENATE AND

01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:05.158
THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEW

01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:07.527
PROPOSAL FOLK WITH THE FOCUS ON

01:56:10.596 --> 01:56:11.531
SERVICES.

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:13.533
AND SO FORTH THE MAIN

01:56:13.599 --> 01:56:16.302
DIFFERENCES ARE ON THE AMOUNTS

01:56:16.369 --> 01:56:18.004
THE SENATE WOULD BE PROVIDED FOR

01:56:18.071 --> 01:56:19.238
UNDER TWENTY SEVEN MILLION BY

01:56:19.305 --> 01:56:20.940
TWO NEW PAYMENTS WHILE THE

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:22.508
ADMINISTRATION WOULD PROVIDE SIX

01:56:22.575 --> 01:56:23.609
HUNDRED MILLION.

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:25.178
THERE ARE SOME RELATIVELY MINOR

01:56:25.244 --> 01:56:26.946
DIFFERENCES IN DOLLAR TERMS.

01:56:27.013 --> 01:56:28.748
REGARDING WHAT SERVICES ARE

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:30.249
FUNDING FUNDED PEDIATRIC DAY

01:56:30.316 --> 01:56:32.318
HEALTH IN THE SENATE FOR EXAMPLE

01:56:32.385 --> 01:56:33.686
WHICH WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY

01:56:33.753 --> 01:56:35.188
ABOUT PAYMENT BOOSTS IN UNDER

01:56:35.254 --> 01:56:37.023
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN. AND

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.858
THEN NOT THE SENATE DOES PROVIDE.

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:40.560
SENDS PLAN DOES PLACE A LITTLE

01:56:40.626 --> 01:56:41.861
MORE EMPHASIS ON CERTAIN

01:56:41.928 --> 01:56:44.130
SPECIALTY CARE AMONG PEDIATRICS

01:56:44.197 --> 01:56:45.365
I SUPPOSE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:56:45.431 --> 01:56:46.899
WHICH IS LARGELY FOCUSED ON

01:56:46.966 --> 01:56:48.134
PRIMARY CARE.

01:56:48.201 --> 01:56:50.436
AND THEN THE OF THE MAJOR OTHER

01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:51.938
DIFFERENCES THE ONGOING NATURE

01:56:52.004 --> 01:56:54.240
OF THE SENATE'S ACTION WITH THE

01:56:54.307 --> 01:56:55.908
TWO YEAR FEDERAL APPROVAL WE

01:56:55.975 --> 01:56:57.744
FIND THAT ALL OF THE TWO YEAR

01:56:57.810 --> 01:56:59.045
FEDERAL APPROVED PROVOKE PLANNED

01:56:59.112 --> 01:57:00.513
OUT CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE IN

01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:02.348
CONCEPT. BUT AS IT WOULD PREVENT

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:04.117
SOME OF THE INTER DISRUPTIONS

01:57:04.183 --> 01:57:04.884
THAT HAVE OCCURRED.

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.953
GEKI HAD GIVEN ONE YEAR

01:57:07.019 --> 01:57:08.921
APPROVAL AND RE APPROVAL TIME

01:57:08.988 --> 01:57:09.589
LINES UNDER.

01:57:09.655 --> 01:57:10.990
WITH THAT WE'D HAVE TO GO

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:12.692
THROUGH WITH THE FED UP WHILE WE

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:13.926
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:57:13.993 --> 01:57:14.994
LEGISLATURE.

01:57:15.061 --> 01:57:16.662
CONSIDER MAKING THIS.

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:18.898
THIS FUNDING LIMITED TERM AS

01:57:18.965 --> 01:57:20.600
OPPOSED ONGOING.

01:57:20.666 --> 01:57:21.734
LIMITED TERM COULD.

01:57:21.801 --> 01:57:23.569
COULD MEAN MULTI YEAR SO THAT

01:57:23.636 --> 01:57:25.238
WE HAVE AN EXTENDED TIME PERIOD

01:57:25.304 --> 01:57:26.939
TO REALLY ASCERTAIN THE EFFECTS

01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:28.941
THAT THE PAYMENTS ARE HAVING ON

01:57:29.008 --> 01:57:30.109
IMPROVE ACCESS WITHIN THE

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:31.444
MEDICARE PROGRAM.

01:57:31.511 --> 01:57:33.946
AND SO WE WE WOULD THINK THAT

01:57:34.013 --> 01:57:35.148
THERE COULD BE AYE THEIR SCAN

01:57:35.214 --> 01:57:36.649
SOME CONSIDERATION THERE AND

01:57:36.716 --> 01:57:38.184
THEN FINALLY ARE GIVEN OUR

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:38.885
INTEREST IN.

01:57:38.951 --> 01:57:40.887
EVALUATING IN TRYING TO

01:57:40.953 --> 01:57:43.022
UNDERSTAND THAT THE IMPACT THESE

01:57:43.089 --> 01:57:44.424
PAYMENTS ARE HAVING WE DO

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:46.325
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:48.828
DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO.

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:51.330
PRODUCER REPORT THAT DETAILS OF

01:57:51.397 --> 01:57:53.366
THE IMPACT THAT THE PAYMENTS ARE

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:55.635
HAVING ON INCREASED ACCESS

01:57:55.701 --> 01:57:57.470
WITHIN MEDI CAL AGAIN FAILED TO

TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU

WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:59:46.045 --> 01:59:47.146
I WANTED TO.

ADD TO WHAT THE LA O. SAID FOR

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:50.650
THE NECESSITY FOR THE CONTINUITY

01:59:50.716 --> 01:59:52.451
OF THESE PROGRAMS.

01:59:52.518 --> 01:59:53.653
THAT DOING I'M ONE YEAR AT A

01:59:53.719 --> 01:59:55.054
TIME MAKES IT AWFULLY DIFFICULT

01:59:55.121 --> 01:59:56.956
TO BOTH.

01:59:57.023 --> 01:59:59.191
TRACK RESULTS AND DETERMINE

HAS CODES THAT WE'VE SELECTED

02:00:03.129 --> 02:00:04.664
ARE ENOUGH BEING EFFECTIVE.

02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:06.265
AND SO JUST WOULD ASK THE

02:00:06.332 --> 02:00:08.234
DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO HAVE A

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:10.670
MULTI YEAR APPROACH DEALING WITH

02:00:10.736 --> 02:00:12.471
THESE RATES TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:13.673

02:00:13.739 --> 02:00:15.374
FORWARD.

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:17.977
AM I DO WANT TO ADD IF I CAN A

02:00:18.044 --> 02:00:20.513
BIT OF CONCERN THAT. THE

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:21.981
PHYSICIAN LOAN REPAYMENTS WHILE

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:23.215
I'M QUITE SUPPORTIVE OF THEM

02:00:23.282 --> 02:00:25.017
SEEMED TO BE.

02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:27.053
A HEFTY NUMBER AND I'M

02:00:27.119 --> 02:00:29.589
WONDERING OF FINANCE HAS ANY

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:30.489
CONCERNS OVER.

02:00:30.556 --> 02:00:32.658
THAT PROGRAM BEING OVER

02:00:32.725 --> 02:00:34.727
PRESCRIBED IS.

02:00:34.794 --> 02:00:36.896
IS THERE AND WHAT REALISTICALLY

02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:37.997
COULD WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT THESE

02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:41.667
ONE TIME FUNDS.

02:00:41.734 --> 02:00:43.869
SO I THINK THE IDEA BEHIND.

02:00:43.936 --> 02:00:46.072
THE AMOUNTS IS THAT WE WANTED

02:00:46.138 --> 02:00:47.506
TO PROVIDE A LARGE ENOUGH

02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:49.208
INCENTIVE SO THAT WE COULD.

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:51.811
REPAY A LARGE A PORTION OF

02:00:51.877 --> 02:00:53.012
PROVIDERS LOANS THAT THERE

02:00:53.079 --> 02:00:54.981
INCENTIVIZE TO APPLY SO WE DON'T

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:56.449
WANT TO GO OUT WITH A

02:00:56.515 --> 02:00:58.017
SOLICITATION FOR TO HAVE PEOPLE

02:00:58.084 --> 02:01:00.252
APPLY FOR AID AND THEN NOT GET

02:01:00.319 --> 02:01:02.254
ENOUGH APPLICATIONS IN. AND THEN

02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:03.689
THE OTHER THING THAT WE DID WAS

02:01:03.756 --> 02:01:05.091
THAT WE ARE PROPOSING.

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:06.726
AS A NUMBER OF YEARS TO

02:01:06.792 --> 02:01:08.594
ENCUMBER THOSE FUNDS AND SO

02:01:08.661 --> 02:01:10.363
THERE IS NO EXPECTATION THAT

02:01:10.429 --> 02:01:11.764
THAT HUNDRED NINETY MILLION FOR

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:12.965
POSITIONS IN THE THIRTY MILLION

02:01:13.032 --> 02:01:14.634
FOR DENNIS WILL ALL BE SPENT THE

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:15.167
BUDGET YEAR.

02:01:15.234 --> 02:01:16.502
UT WE'RE GOING TO BUDGET FOR

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:17.536
THOSE FUNDS IN THE BUDGET YEAR

02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:18.337
BUT WE'RE GONNA GIVE SEVERAL

02:01:18.404 --> 02:01:20.006
YEARS TO ENCUMBER AND AND

02:01:20.072 --> 02:01:22.108

02:08:54.593 --> 02:08:57.029
ARE ABOUT THE SUB ACCOUNTS FOR

02:08:57.096 --> 02:08:58.564
THE CAL WORKS AND MEDI CAL

02:08:58.630 --> 02:09:00.165
RESERVE FUNDS.

02:09:00.232 --> 02:09:01.100
SO I MEAN I I THINK WE'RE ALL

02:09:01.166 --> 02:09:02.501
UNIFIED IN OUR DESIRE TO MAKE

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:04.703
SURE THAT RESERVE WORK WE HAVE

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:05.504
SOME HEALTHY RESERVES. AND.

02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:07.473
A.

02:09:07.539 --> 02:09:08.540
THAT WE HAVE VERY PROPOSALS IN

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:10.142
THE BUDGET TO DO THAT.

02:09:10.209 --> 02:09:12.878
A I AM I CONFUSED ABOUT WHY WE

02:09:12.945 --> 02:09:14.713
WOULD NEED TO HAVE SPECIFIC SOME

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:16.448
ACCOUNTS WITH RESERVES EARMARKED

02:09:16.515 --> 02:09:18.851
FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS BECAUSE

02:09:18.917 --> 02:09:19.952
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE

02:09:20.018 --> 02:09:21.120
STATE WISHING ROBUST RESERVES AT

02:09:21.186 --> 02:09:22.588
THE STATE LEVEL. TO MAKE SURE

02:09:22.654 --> 02:09:22.788
THAT.

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:23.856
THAT.

02:09:23.922 --> 02:09:24.957
DOES THE STATE PROGRAMS ARE

02:09:25.023 --> 02:09:26.492
CUSHION AND IT'S NOT JUST CAL

02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:27.926
WORKS IN MEDI CAL ME WE CAN

02:09:27.993 --> 02:09:29.027
IDENTIFY DOZENS AND DOZENS.

02:09:29.094 --> 02:09:30.329
THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADVERSELY

02:09:30.395 --> 02:09:32.131
AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF

02:09:32.197 --> 02:09:33.465
RECESSION SO THE QUESTIONS OF

02:09:33.532 --> 02:09:35.134
WHY THESE. IT OFF WE GO DOWN

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:36.368
THIS PATH IT'S LIKE GOING DOWN

02:09:36.435 --> 02:09:37.970
THE RABBIT HOLE WE CAN ESTABLISH

02:09:38.036 --> 02:09:39.638
SOME ACCOUNTS WITH YOUR MARKS

02:09:39.705 --> 02:09:40.706
FOR EVERY STATE PROGRAM BECAUSE

02:09:40.772 --> 02:09:42.241
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WHOLE

02:09:42.307 --> 02:09:42.875
POINT. OF DOING IT AT THE STATE

02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:46.445
LEVEL.

02:09:46.512 --> 02:09:47.880
I THINK IT'S ONLY MY MARK.

02:09:47.946 --> 02:09:48.447
CANTONS OF THE LEGISLATIVE

02:09:48.514 --> 02:09:50.115
ANALYST'S OFFICE UNCERTAINLY

02:09:50.182 --> 02:09:51.450
IT'S A POLICY DECISION WHETHER

02:09:51.517 --> 02:09:53.852
TO EARMARK PARTICULAR FINDS IN A

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.420
RESERVE SUB ACCOUNT OR NOT TO DO

02:09:55.487 --> 02:09:56.255
SO.

02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:57.623
OBVIOUSLY RESERVES THAT ARE

02:09:57.689 --> 02:09:59.091
HELD AT THE US IF YOU'RE THE BSA

02:09:59.158 --> 02:10:00.292
WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY

02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:01.994
PROGRAM WHERE. WHEREAS THIS IS

02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:03.395
NAM ESSENTIALLY A SIGNALING

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:04.963
DEVICE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:06.665
USE TO SAY THAT IT'S DESIGNATING.

02:10:06.732 --> 02:10:08.567
SET OF PROGRAMS TO BE A HIGHER

02:10:08.634 --> 02:10:10.369
PRIORITY FOR PRESERVATION AND

02:10:10.435 --> 02:10:11.336
FUTURE RECESSION BUT AGAIN

02:10:11.403 --> 02:10:12.638
THAT'S THAT'S A COMPLETE POLICY

02:10:12.704 --> 02:10:14.740
CHOICE AND. UP THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:15.040
DISCUSSION.

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:16.775
OKAY I'M JUST.

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:17.976
BOB WELCOME THE VERY STRONG

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:19.578
PROPONENT OF HAVING ADEQUATE

FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS JUST

02:10:24.583 --> 02:10:26.718
BECAUSE. THERE'S NO DEFINITION

02:10:26.785 --> 02:10:28.153
OF WHERE THAT STOPS BECAUSE NEXT

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:29.421
YEAR WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE

02:10:29.488 --> 02:10:31.056
COUPLE MORE AND THEN BECOMES

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:33.892

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:42.301
COMMENT ON.

02:10:42.367 --> 02:10:44.303
SO.

02:10:44.369 --> 02:10:46.371
WE HOPEFULLY WILL NOT INTO EARTH

02:10:46.438 --> 02:10:47.806
THE TYPE OF RECESSION WE IN TWO

02:10:47.873 --> 02:10:49.274
WORDS AT THE POINT THAT I GOT

02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:51.343
ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY IN TWO

02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:52.811
THOUSAND AND EIGHT. IN YOU KNOW

02:10:52.878 --> 02:10:54.813
WE WERE IN DEFICIT MODE THROUGH

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:57.216
TO. THINK TWELFTH MAY BE BEYOND

02:10:57.282 --> 02:10:58.717
TWELVE.

02:10:58.784 --> 02:11:00.953
BUT DEFINITELY TILL TWELVE. AND

02:11:01.019 --> 02:11:03.288
WE HAD TO CUT.

02:11:03.355 --> 02:11:04.856
OBVIOUSLY MULTIPLE AREAS THE

02:11:04.923 --> 02:11:06.792
STATE BUDGET.

02:11:06.858 --> 02:11:07.826
BUT AS.

02:11:07.893 --> 02:11:10.162
WAS ARTICULATED IN THE

02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:11.396
DESCRIPTION OF THIS SAFETY NET

02:11:11.463 --> 02:11:14.032
RESERVE.

02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:17.135
WE HAD TO CUT.

02:11:17.202 --> 02:11:18.570
THIS PART OF THE STATE BUDGET

02:11:18.637 --> 02:11:20.339
MEANING THE CAL WORKS AND THE

02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:22.107
OTHER.

02:11:22.174 --> 02:11:25.010
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS.

02:11:25.077 --> 02:11:26.678
AT THE SAME TIME THE NEED WAS

02:11:26.745 --> 02:11:29.748
GROWING SO WE IF IT'S THERE IT'S

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:31.450
A.

02:11:31.516 --> 02:11:32.584
PERVERSE TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCE IN

02:11:32.651 --> 02:11:33.719
THAT.

02:11:33.785 --> 02:11:35.954
WE.

02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:38.056
THIS IS THE ONE AREA WHERE WE

02:11:38.123 --> 02:11:39.658
CAN GUARANTEED THE NEED BECOMES

02:11:39.725 --> 02:11:41.460
GREATER.

02:11:41.526 --> 02:11:43.629
WHEN WE FACE A DEFICIT.

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:45.597
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE BUDGETS

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:48.066
NEED IS NOT NECESSARILY GREATER

02:11:48.133 --> 02:11:50.035
DURING A DEFICIT.

02:11:50.102 --> 02:11:52.904
COURSE NO CUT IS FUN BUT THERE

02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:53.905
NEEDS ARE NOT NECESSARILY

02:11:53.972 --> 02:11:55.574
GREATER.

02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:57.409
WHERE IS THE CASELOAD FOR THIS

02:11:57.476 --> 02:11:59.311
TYPE OF PROGRAM GOES UP WHEN

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:01.113
THERE IS A RECESSION BECAUSE

02:12:01.179 --> 02:12:02.714
USUALLY WE UNEMPLOYMENT GOES UP

02:12:02.781 --> 02:12:04.683
AND?

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:07.886
SO I. I THINK.

02:12:07.953 --> 02:12:09.388
I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF IT

02:12:09.454 --> 02:12:10.922
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS THE ONE

02:12:10.989 --> 02:12:13.091
AREA THE BUDGET THAT WE CAN

02:12:13.158 --> 02:12:14.459
PRETTY MUCH.

02:12:14.526 --> 02:12:16.161
GUARANTEE

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:18.163
WILL HAVE A GREATER NEED IN THAT

02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:20.332
TIME.

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:21.366
THEN OTHER BUDGETARY.

02:12:21.433 --> 02:12:23.201
THAN OTHER STATE.

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:24.569
.

02:12:24.636 --> 02:12:25.637
DEPARTMENTS.

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:28.807
AND.

02:12:28.874 --> 02:12:29.041
TO.

02:12:30.575 --> 02:12:32.544
TO BE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE

02:12:32.611 --> 02:12:34.479
WE HAD NOTHING TO TURN TO TO

02:12:34.546 --> 02:12:36.114
DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT OUR

02:12:36.181 --> 02:12:37.916
CASELOAD WAS INCREASING DURING

02:12:37.983 --> 02:12:39.751
THAT RECESSIONARY TIMES.

02:12:39.818 --> 02:12:41.053
WAS REALLY A VERY HORRIBLE

02:12:41.119 --> 02:12:42.854
EXPERIENCE FOR MANY OF US.

02:12:42.921 --> 02:12:46.325
AND WE KNEW THAT WE HAD. A

02:12:46.391 --> 02:12:47.793
GROWING NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA

02:12:47.859 --> 02:12:49.194
RESIDENTS

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:50.962
WHO NEEDED SAFETY NET AND WE

02:12:51.029 --> 02:12:52.397
WERE NOT IN THE POSITION TO

02:12:52.464 --> 02:12:54.599
ASSIST THEM WHATSOEVER. AND SO I

02:12:54.666 --> 02:12:57.869
THINK THAT THE THE BENEFIT IF WE

02:12:57.936 --> 02:12:58.870
STRUCTURE SOMETHING LIKE HIS

02:12:58.937 --> 02:12:59.871
SAFETY NEVER SERVICE THAT

02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:02.441
GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL NOT BE.

02:13:02.507 --> 02:13:03.709
WELL IT DOESN'T GUARANTEE THAT

02:13:03.775 --> 02:13:05.344
WE BE ABLE TO SATISFY A FULL

02:13:05.410 --> 02:13:06.478
CASELOAD INCREASE BECAUSE WE

02:13:06.545 --> 02:13:07.979
CANNOT EVERY DETERMINE WHAT THE

02:13:08.046 --> 02:13:09.948
MAGNITUDE. OF THE FUTURE

02:13:10.015 --> 02:13:11.783
DOWNTURN MIGHT BE IT CERTAINLY

02:13:11.850 --> 02:13:14.252
WOULD GIVE US BETTER ABILITY TO

02:13:14.319 --> 02:13:16.221
RESPOND THAT WE HAD IN OUR LAST

02:13:16.288 --> 02:13:18.890
CIRCUMSTANCE.

02:13:18.957 --> 02:13:21.493
THANK YOU SIR GENERAL.

02:13:28.233 --> 02:13:29.735
CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON.

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:31.670
THE DIP THE WAY WE DEPOSIT MONEY

02:13:31.737 --> 02:13:33.271
THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT SO WE

02:13:33.338 --> 02:13:34.406
CAN ACCUMULATE IN THERE AND THEN

02:13:34.473 --> 02:13:35.774
THERE CERTAINLY RESTRICTIONS ON

02:13:35.841 --> 02:13:37.876
HOW WE WITHDRAW THAT MONEY GIVEN

02:13:37.943 --> 02:13:39.444

02:14:12.944 --> 02:14:14.546
SUBMITTED FLEXIBILITY. IF

02:14:14.613 --> 02:14:17.048
NOTHING ELSE TO DEPOSIT MORE

02:14:17.115 --> 02:14:18.750
MONEY INTO A RESERVE.

02:14:18.817 --> 02:14:21.420
THAN WE MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE.

02:14:21.486 --> 02:14:23.822
NOW YOU CAN CORRECT.

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:25.824
NO CORRECTION.

02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:28.493
THAT'S ALL I CARED SO JUST MAY

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.629
BE A SLIGHT ADDITION OF CONTEXT

02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:32.364
IS THAT THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

02:14:32.431 --> 02:14:34.199
ACCOUNT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RAINY

02:14:34.266 --> 02:14:34.966
DAY FUND DOES HAVE A WOMEN

02:14:35.033 --> 02:14:36.468
ACCOUNT. OF TEN PERCENT OF

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:37.602
GENERAL FUND REVENUES WERE AS

02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:39.438
THE AS A FEW OTHERS CAUTIONARY

02:14:39.504 --> 02:14:41.173
RESERVE DOES NOT HAVE A LIMIT.

02:14:41.239 --> 02:14:42.941
BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME PROVISIONS

02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:44.609
THAT WOULD TRIGGER REDUCTIONS IN

02:14:44.676 --> 02:14:45.777
THE SALES TAX RATE IF IT'S

02:14:45.844 --> 02:14:47.279
BALLOTS REACHES A CERTAIN

02:14:47.345 --> 02:14:48.814
THRESHOLD.

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:49.748
SO IN OTHER WORDS AT SOME POINT

02:14:49.815 --> 02:14:51.516
THE TRIGGERS HIT

02:14:51.583 --> 02:14:53.485
SALES TAX RATES REDUCED AND

02:14:53.552 --> 02:14:55.520
CONSEQUENCES HAPPEN AS A RESULT

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:57.355
SPECIFICALLY OUT SALES TAX GOES

02:14:57.422 --> 02:14:58.757
DOWN BUT THEN RESERVES WOULD

02:14:58.824 --> 02:14:59.658
ALSO GO DOWN AS A RESULT RIGHT.

02:14:59.724 --> 02:15:00.859

02:23:27.365 --> 02:23:30.702
AND THEN.

02:23:30.768 --> 02:23:32.070
WHY NOT GENERAL FUND WOULD BE MY

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:34.105
FOLLOW UP QUESTION?

02:23:34.172 --> 02:23:35.606
THOSE ARE DRAGGED OVER THE PART

02:23:35.673 --> 02:23:36.708
OF FINANCE SO THERE WAS.

02:23:36.774 --> 02:23:39.143
REPORTING TWENTY SIXTEEN BY UC

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:41.012
DAVIS WHICH DID ESTIMATE THE

02:23:41.079 --> 02:23:42.380
COST OF WILDLIFE VEHICLE

02:23:42.447 --> 02:23:44.482
CONFLICT. AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

02:23:44.549 --> 02:23:45.850
TWENTY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY

02:23:45.917 --> 02:23:46.884
THIRTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE

02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:49.253
THERE IS AN IMPACT TO WILDLIFE

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.588
WITH VEHICLES WHICH IS THE NEXT

02:23:50.655 --> 02:23:52.323
IF. THE DEPARTMENT I HAVE TO AND

02:23:52.390 --> 02:23:54.993
YOU RESPOND TO TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS

02:23:55.059 --> 02:23:56.961
INVOLVING WOUNDED WILDLIFE. THEY

02:23:57.028 --> 02:23:58.930
RESPOND TO TH BILLS CAUSED BY

02:23:58.997 --> 02:24:00.198
VEHICLES ON ROADWAYS.

02:24:00.264 --> 02:24:03.468
THEY ALSO DO HAVE TO.

02:24:03.534 --> 02:24:04.535
RESPOND TO MOTOR VEHICLE

02:24:04.602 --> 02:24:06.704
COLLISIONS AND ENGAGE IN

02:24:06.771 --> 02:24:07.572
ENFORCEMENT OF THE MORE COULD BE

02:24:07.638 --> 02:24:09.640
ABLE CODE AS WE DO BELIEVE THERE

02:24:09.707 --> 02:24:12.076
IS A CLEAR NEXUS. BETWEEN OUR

02:24:12.143 --> 02:24:14.746
VEHICLE AND WHILE A CONFLICT.

02:24:14.812 --> 02:24:17.648
AND THE TIRE RECYCLING FUN.

02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:19.417
SO THE TIRE IS WHAT WE CONSIDER

02:24:19.484 --> 02:24:21.085
A PROXY TO THE VEHICLE.

02:24:21.152 --> 02:24:24.589
A CONFLICT AND A VEHICLE IMPACT

02:24:24.655 --> 02:24:26.691
AS WE SEE THE MOTOR VEHICLE CAO

02:24:26.758 --> 02:24:28.593
AND THEIR TIRES LIKELY FIND BOWS

02:24:28.659 --> 02:24:29.060
AS THE.

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:34.098
A NEXUS TO VEHICLES.

02:24:34.165 --> 02:24:35.800
AND IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:37.769
POSITION THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH

02:24:37.835 --> 02:24:40.004
FUNDS.

02:24:40.071 --> 02:24:44.208
TO BOTH ACHIEVE. THE GOALS.

02:24:44.275 --> 02:24:46.377
DATA UP FISH AND WILDLIFE NADER

02:24:46.444 --> 02:24:47.712
AT LEAST YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF

02:24:47.779 --> 02:24:49.147
MONEY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:24:49.213 --> 02:24:51.582
PROPOSING. AND THE ONGOING AND

02:24:51.649 --> 02:24:53.885
FUTURE NEEDS OF FOUR. OF THOSE

02:24:53.951 --> 02:24:55.953
AGENCIES THAT ALSO ARE RELYING

02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:58.556
ON THE SPOT.

02:24:58.623 --> 02:25:00.458
MAN ARMY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:25:00.525 --> 02:25:02.727
SO WHAT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED

02:25:02.794 --> 02:25:04.028
HERE ISN'T PERSPECTIVE FOR THE

02:25:04.095 --> 02:25:06.297
TIRE RECYCLING FUND FOR EXAMPLE

02:25:06.364 --> 02:25:07.932
IS TRUE THAT THOSE EXISTING.

02:25:07.999 --> 02:25:08.833
FUNDS ARE.

02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:11.035
SUPPORT THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM

02:25:11.102 --> 02:25:12.603
BUT PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:14.739
PROPOSAL IS TO FULLY FUNDED

02:25:14.806 --> 02:25:16.974
FULLY BACK FILL THE CARL MOYER

02:25:17.041 --> 02:25:18.309
PROGRAM WITH CAP AND TRADE FUNDS.

02:25:18.376 --> 02:25:20.111
SO AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL

02:25:20.178 --> 02:25:22.180
THERE ARE NO PROGRAM REDUCTIONS

02:25:22.246 --> 02:25:23.915
ASSOCIATED WITH FEES THERE'S A

02:25:23.981 --> 02:25:26.184
CLEAR PROGRAMMATIC NEXUS AND IT

02:25:26.250 --> 02:25:27.185
NOT ONLY ADDRESSES THE

02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:28.619
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT.

02:25:28.686 --> 02:25:30.588
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT BUT IT

02:25:30.655 --> 02:25:32.390
ALSO ADDRESSES WHAT WE WOULD

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:33.958
CALL NO REGRETS PROGRAM

02:25:34.025 --> 02:25:35.460
ENHANCEMENTS THAT.

02:25:35.526 --> 02:25:37.261
THROUGH LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION

02:25:37.328 --> 02:25:38.930
WHICH ASKED THE DEPARTMENT TO

02:25:38.996 --> 02:25:40.465
CONVENE THAT STAKEHOLDERS

02:25:40.531 --> 02:25:41.966
IDENTIFIED THESE.

02:25:42.033 --> 02:25:43.301
KINDA CORE MISSION

02:25:43.367 --> 02:25:45.770
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIRTY

02:25:45.837 --> 02:25:46.170
MILLION DOLLARS.

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:49.640
DE AND YEAH AND.

02:25:49.707 --> 02:25:51.109
AS MISTER AGUILAR SAID.

02:25:51.175 --> 02:25:54.212
DOES RELATE TO TRANSPORTATION.

02:25:54.278 --> 02:25:55.246
IS IT ENVISIONED UP CAP AND

02:25:55.313 --> 02:25:56.781
TRADE

02:25:56.848 --> 02:25:58.983
BACK FILL WOULD BE ONGOING.

02:25:59.050 --> 02:26:00.551
THAT IS CORRECT IT WOULD BE

02:26:00.618 --> 02:26:00.918
BUILT INTO THE.

02:26:00.985 --> 02:26:05.389
BASELINE.

02:26:05.456 --> 02:26:05.656
I WANT TO.

02:26:05.723 --> 02:26:05.890
HAPPENS

02:26:05.957 --> 02:26:08.459
BUT.

02:26:08.526 --> 02:26:10.027
CAP AND TRADE DOESN'T.

02:26:10.094 --> 02:26:12.396
KEEP UP CURRENT RIGHT.

02:26:12.463 --> 02:26:14.565
SO BECAUSE IT WOULD BE PART OF

02:26:14.632 --> 02:26:16.033
THE BASELINE WHICH WOULD BE

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:17.268
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PROGRAMS

02:26:17.335 --> 02:26:18.703
THAT ARE FUNDED IN THE BASELINE

02:26:18.769 --> 02:26:20.972
OF FOR EXAMPLE. LAST YEAR.

02:26:21.038 --> 02:26:23.341
BASED ON THE LEGISLATIVE

02:26:23.407 --> 02:26:25.176
REAUTHORIZATION A CAP AND TRADE

02:26:25.243 --> 02:26:26.677
PROVIDED ON GOING.

02:26:26.744 --> 02:26:29.647
GRF FUNDS TO BACK FILL CAL

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:31.115
FIRES ES ARRAY FUND.

02:26:31.182 --> 02:26:33.484
THAT WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY FUNDS

02:26:33.551 --> 02:26:35.620
THAT ARE CONTINUING IN THE BASE

02:26:35.686 --> 02:26:37.121
AND ENOUGH.

02:26:37.188 --> 02:26:38.623
CAPITA TRADE OPTIONS ARE LESS

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:39.690
THEN.

02:26:39.757 --> 02:26:41.392
THAT WOULD AFFECT

02:26:41.459 --> 02:26:43.461
THE SO CALLED DISCRETIONARY

02:26:43.528 --> 02:26:45.563
FORTY PERCENT THAT THE

02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:46.531
LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS.

02:26:46.597 --> 02:26:49.934
EACH YEAR.

02:26:50.001 --> 02:26:51.235
THANK YOU AND. I HAVE ONE OTHER

02:26:51.302 --> 02:26:52.904
QUESTION.

02:26:52.970 --> 02:26:56.674
THAT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY.

02:26:56.741 --> 02:26:58.409
WHY NOT GENERAL FUND?

ACTIVITIES.

02:29:11.342 --> 02:29:13.444
RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION AND

02:29:13.511 --> 02:29:14.578
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THEIR

02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:16.147
BASELINE EXPENDITURES.

TRANSPORTATION RELATED

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:22.053
ACTIVITIES.

02:29:22.119 --> 02:29:24.488
AND THAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR.

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:25.756
OF OUR PROPOSAL WHERE

02:29:25.823 --> 02:29:27.291
ESSENTIALLY ASKING FOR A TOTAL

OF. ABOUT THIRTY SIX MILLION.

02:29:29.827 --> 02:29:31.529
.

02:29:31.595 --> 02:29:33.264
FOR THAT PURPOSE I DON'T HAVE IT

02:29:33.331 --> 02:29:34.632
HERE IN FRONT OF ME WHAT'S THE

02:29:34.699 --> 02:29:35.399
DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENT'S

02:29:35.466 --> 02:29:38.569
ANNUAL BUDGET.

02:29:38.636 --> 02:29:39.103
AROUND SIX HUNDRED MILLION

02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:40.538
DOLLARS HERE.

02:29:40.604 --> 02:29:42.840
OKAY SO.

02:29:42.907 --> 02:29:44.508
LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. THEY

02:29:44.575 --> 02:29:46.243
SPEND ON A TRAFFIC RELATED.

02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:48.379
IF.

02:29:48.446 --> 02:29:49.447
AND SENATOR JUST TO CLARIFY THE

02:29:49.513 --> 02:29:50.548
INFORMATION THE DEPARTMENT

02:29:50.614 --> 02:29:52.817
PROVIDED IT'S NOT JUST VEHICLES

02:29:52.883 --> 02:29:54.218
HITTING WILDLIFE AND NEEDING TO

02:29:54.285 --> 02:29:55.119
DEAL WITH THAT THEY WENT THROUGH

02:29:55.186 --> 02:29:56.921
A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE IT'S ALSO

02:29:56.987 --> 02:29:59.590
TIME THEIR WARDENS WHO WHO SERVE

02:29:59.657 --> 02:30:01.926
AS SOME KIND OF.

02:30:01.992 --> 02:30:03.427
CLUB CHP TYPE ROLE IN CERTAIN

02:30:03.494 --> 02:30:05.429
AREAS THEIR SWORN PEACE OFFICERS

02:30:05.496 --> 02:30:07.698
IT'S ALSO PLANNING FOR WHERE

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:09.166
ROADS ARE GONNA GO.

02:30:09.233 --> 02:30:11.168
SO THERE WERE VARIETY OF IMPACTS

02:30:11.235 --> 02:30:12.336
THAT THEY WENT THROUGH AND

02:30:12.403 --> 02:30:13.804
ANALYZE THAT THEY BELIEVED WERE.

02:30:13.871 --> 02:30:15.840
HAD A NEXUS WITH TRANSPORTATION

02:30:15.906 --> 02:30:17.508
NOT JUST THE WILDLIFE AND CAR

02:30:17.575 --> 02:30:19.276
INCIDENTS.

02:30:19.343 --> 02:30:21.145
WELL THIS IS CLEARLY A POLICY

02:30:21.212 --> 02:30:23.214
ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO. REQUIRE A

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:24.448
MUCH MORE EXTENDED DEBATE THEN

02:30:24.515 --> 02:30:25.716
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IN

02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:27.118
HERE I THINK PROBABLY IT IS A

02:30:27.184 --> 02:30:29.420
GOOD IDEA TO HAVE AN ALL.

02:30:29.487 --> 02:30:30.788
HAVE SOME POLICY DISCUSSION ON

02:30:30.855 --> 02:30:32.656
HOW WE USED THESE.

02:30:32.723 --> 02:30:34.759
TRANSPORTATION RELATED FEES AND

02:30:34.825 --> 02:30:35.860
FRANKLY MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:30:35.926 --> 02:30:37.328
PUBLIC KNOWS.

02:30:37.395 --> 02:30:39.096
OF THAT THESE FEES ARE BEING

02:30:39.163 --> 02:30:40.698
USED FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HAVE

02:30:40.765 --> 02:30:42.299
SOME FEEDBACK AS TO WHETHER

02:30:42.366 --> 02:30:43.734
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THEY WANT.

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:48.305
THEIR FEES TO GO SO I DO I DO.

02:30:48.372 --> 02:30:50.107
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE

02:30:50.174 --> 02:30:50.941
DEPARTMENT IS NOT ABLE TO.

02:30:51.008 --> 02:30:53.511
.

02:30:53.577 --> 02:30:55.146
SORT OF RESTRUCTURING ITSELF TO

02:30:55.212 --> 02:30:56.981
PROVIDE SOME DEGREE OF SOLVENCY

02:30:57.047 --> 02:30:58.616
SO.

02:30:58.682 --> 02:31:00.251
I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

02:31:00.317 --> 02:31:01.519
RESULTS OF THE AUDIT.

02:31:01.585 --> 02:31:03.721

FOLKS OUT THERE.

02:31:14.965 --> 02:31:16.634
THEN I'M TALKING TO.

02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:19.503
THE PUBLIC.

02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:21.071
THIS IS AN ISSUE OF TRUST AND WE

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:23.474
GET BACK TO IT AGAIN.

02:31:23.541 --> 02:31:25.176
TAKING MONEY THAT THE PUBLIC IS

02:31:25.242 --> 02:31:26.577
BEEN PROMISED WE'RE GONNA GO TO

02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:28.245
SAY STREETS ROADS AND HIGHWAYS

02:31:28.312 --> 02:31:30.948
AND USING IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

02:31:31.015 --> 02:31:31.615
OR THE TIRE

02:31:31.682 --> 02:31:34.919
FREE.

02:31:34.985 --> 02:31:36.253
SUPPOSED TO BE A RECYCLING.

02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:38.989
FUND.

02:31:39.056 --> 02:31:41.559
AND IN VETTING CREATIVE WAYS TO

02:31:41.625 --> 02:31:42.960
DIRECT THE MONEY IN OTHER

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:46.030
DIRECTIONS.

02:31:46.096 --> 02:31:46.897
I SUBMIT THE PUBLIC GET PRETTY

02:31:46.964 --> 02:31:48.999
MAD ABOUT THIS.

02:31:49.066 --> 02:31:50.835
WE JUST LEARNED EARLIER IN THE

02:31:50.901 --> 02:31:52.336
SUBCOMMITTEE UP A TREMENDOUS

02:31:52.403 --> 02:31:54.505
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:57.842
GOING INTO PARKS.

02:31:57.908 --> 02:32:00.010
OUT OF SB ONE.

02:32:00.077 --> 02:32:01.011
NO WE ALREADY KNEW THERE WERE

02:32:01.078 --> 02:32:02.680

02:32:04.281 --> 02:32:07.284
ADDITIONAL AMOUNT.

02:32:07.351 --> 02:32:08.319
AND I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON

02:32:08.385 --> 02:32:10.454
THE LEGISLATURE.

02:32:10.521 --> 02:32:12.823
TO SHINE THE SPOTLIGHT.

02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:15.860
UNDIES MISDIRECTED FUNDS.

02:32:15.926 --> 02:32:16.994
WHERE THE TRUSTED THE PUBLIC HAS

02:32:17.061 --> 02:32:19.597
BEEN VIOLATED?

02:32:19.663 --> 02:32:20.764
THEY HAVE A THOUGHT FOR EXAMPLE

02:32:20.831 --> 02:32:22.666
THAT.

02:32:22.733 --> 02:32:24.902
ONE MONEY.

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:26.337

02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:28.806
HIGHWAYS.

02:32:28.873 --> 02:32:31.275
THAT CLEARLY IS NOT THE CASE.

02:32:31.342 --> 02:32:32.409
GOING BACK EVEN FURTHER THE FIRE

02:32:32.476 --> 02:32:34.545
TAX.

02:32:34.612 --> 02:32:36.847
THAT WAS TO GOING TO PREVENTION.

CAL FIRE.

02:32:40.518 --> 02:32:43.220
WAS VERY EVIDENT.

02:32:43.287 --> 02:32:45.022
LITTLE OF THAT MONEY OF MOST OF

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:52.630
IT WAS NOT GOING INTO CANNOT BE TOLERATED.

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:54.598

IT'S TIME TO TAKE A STAND.

AND KEEP FAITH WITH VOTERS AND

02:33:00.437 --> 02:33:01.338
QUIT PLAYING GAMES

02:33:01.405 --> 02:33:06.443
WITH THEIR MONEY.

ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL WAS

02:37:19.930 --> 02:37:22.166
REJECTED FOR GOOD CAUSE.

02:37:22.232 --> 02:37:23.267

BE REVISITED.

02:37:25.702 --> 02:37:26.837
I THINK THAT THAT IS THE

02:37:26.904 --> 02:37:28.906
IMPOSITION OF ATTACKS THAT TO.

02:37:28.972 --> 02:37:30.641
THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE.

POSITION IN THE SENATE.

02:37:38.248 --> 02:37:39.516
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS IS THIS WAS

02:37:39.583 --> 02:37:40.984
THIS IDEA.

02:37:41.051 --> 02:37:43.220
WAS TO CORRECT.

02:37:43.287 --> 02:37:46.256
AND GENERAL FUND IS ONE SOURCE.

02:37:46.323 --> 02:37:47.191
AN OVERFLOW AND PROP TWO IS

02:37:47.257 --> 02:37:49.827
ANOTHER.

02:37:49.893 --> 02:37:51.094
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS

02:37:51.161 --> 02:37:52.629
SOMETHING THAT WE BETTER RELY ON.

02:37:52.696 --> 02:37:55.098
AND.

02:37:55.165 --> 02:37:56.800
DOING SUCH THINGS IS S. THAT

02:37:56.867 --> 02:37:58.802
MAJOR POLICY AGAIN.

POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS IN

02:38:10.013 --> 02:38:12.249
BOTH HOUSES.

02:38:12.316 --> 02:38:15.352
THAT GETS THE SHORT SHRIFT.

02:38:15.419 --> 02:38:17.554
LET'S LEAVE THIS ONE BE YES WE

02:38:17.621 --> 02:38:20.858

02:38:20.924 --> 02:38:21.892
BUT TO THE DEGREE THAT I'M PRIVY

02:38:21.959 --> 02:38:22.826
AND APPOINT PART OF ANY

02:38:22.893 --> 02:38:24.127

02:38:24.194 --> 02:38:25.863
REVISITING THE ADMINISTRATION

02:38:25.929 --> 02:38:27.531

ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM.

02:38:34.037 --> 02:38:35.505
SO THIS IS A.

02:38:35.572 --> 02:38:36.773
OFF THE AT THE THE WATER ISSUE

02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:39.843
IS A. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE

02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:40.444
AND IT'S ONE THAT'S BEEN.

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:44.181
HAUNTING US REALLY I THINK FOR A

02:38:44.248 --> 02:38:46.483
FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW.

02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:47.851
AND THE BONDING BILL HAS BEEN

02:38:47.918 --> 02:38:50.120
AROUND FOR A COUPLE YEARS.

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:53.123
AT SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORT. A

02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:54.725
AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

02:38:54.791 --> 02:38:56.293

HELP SUPPORT A SOLUTION.

02:39:03.066 --> 02:39:05.836
BUT IS THAT THE ONLY OPTION

02:39:05.903 --> 02:39:07.671
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:39:07.738 --> 02:39:08.972
CONSIDERING UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:39:09.039 --> 02:39:11.742

IN TERMS OF SAFE DRINKING WATER

02:39:34.798 --> 02:39:36.733
IS THE ONGOING OPERATION

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.302
MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR THESE.

02:39:38.368 --> 02:39:40.938
SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:39:41.004 --> 02:39:42.940

02:40:35.425 --> 02:40:36.893
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BUT I

02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:38.395
THINK WE ALL ARE UNANIMOUS IN

02:40:38.462 --> 02:40:40.564
OUR OPINION. THAT ACCESS TO

02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:41.865
CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER

02:40:41.932 --> 02:40:42.833
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT ALL

02:40:42.899 --> 02:40:44.735
CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE.

02:40:44.801 --> 02:40:46.236
BUT IT'S JUST HOW WE GET THERE

02:40:46.303 --> 02:40:47.604
THAT WE ARE DISAGREEING ON HOW

02:40:47.671 --> 02:40:50.307
DO WE PAY FOR IT AND. I THINK

02:40:50.374 --> 02:40:51.208
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IN AN ERA

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:53.310
WHEN. WE HAVE A ABOUT A NINE

02:40:53.377 --> 02:40:54.845
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS TO

02:40:54.911 --> 02:40:56.480
BE TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL

02:40:56.546 --> 02:40:57.647
TAXES THAT ARE ACROSS WORKING

02:40:57.714 --> 02:40:59.549
FAMILIES MONEY.

02:40:59.616 --> 02:41:01.618
I AM IN PARTICULAR. THE TAXES

02:41:01.685 --> 02:41:03.086
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:41:03.153 --> 02:41:04.855
PROPOSED ARE.

02:41:04.921 --> 02:41:07.024
ONEROUS AND REGRESSIVE BECAUSE

02:41:07.090 --> 02:41:08.492
THEY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT

02:41:08.558 --> 02:41:09.860
THE SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION

02:41:09.926 --> 02:41:11.561
THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD IT.

02:41:11.628 --> 02:41:13.830
ARE AMONGST THE.

02:41:13.897 --> 02:41:15.532
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS

02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:17.000
IS A WATER CONNECTION TAX WOULD

02:41:17.067 --> 02:41:22.406
OUT ABOUT A DOLLAR. PER WATER

02:41:22.472 --> 02:41:24.608
CONNECTION TO EVERYONE A BILL IN

02:41:24.674 --> 02:41:26.309
MONTHLY IN CALIFORNIA.

02:41:26.376 --> 02:41:27.978
AND OF THAT. IS IS SOMETHING

02:41:28.045 --> 02:41:29.179
THAT MY CONSTITUENTS ARE VERY

02:41:29.246 --> 02:41:30.113
CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN THEY ARE

02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:30.747
ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR

02:41:30.814 --> 02:41:30.981
BILLS.

02:41:31.048 --> 02:41:31.681
AND IF YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHAT

02:41:31.748 --> 02:41:32.549
WE HAVE DONE IN CALIFORNIA QUITE

02:41:32.616 --> 02:41:34.217
OFTEN THIS IS OUR SOLUTION.

02:41:34.284 --> 02:41:35.819
TO SOLVING PROBLEMS WE SEGMENT

02:41:35.886 --> 02:41:37.554
OUT THE PROBLEM WE TRY AND.

02:41:37.621 --> 02:41:38.889
WORK ORCHESTRATE ATTACKS THAT

02:41:38.955 --> 02:41:40.190
SOLVES THAT PROBLEM BUT

02:41:40.257 --> 02:41:41.491
INADVERTENTLY WHAT WE DO IS WE

02:41:41.558 --> 02:41:43.093
CONTRIBUTE TO THE RISE OF THE

02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:44.728
COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA.

02:41:44.795 --> 02:41:46.163
AND WE INCREASE THE DISPARITY

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:47.597
BETWEEN. WHAT ACOSTA LIVING

02:41:47.664 --> 02:41:48.732
CALIFORNIA WHAT ACOSTA LIVE IN

02:41:48.799 --> 02:41:49.833
OTHER STATES?

02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:51.168
AND A THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:41:51.234 --> 02:41:51.701
THAT'S BEEN A REAL PROBLEM

02:41:51.768 --> 02:41:54.137
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A PROBLEM

02:41:54.204 --> 02:41:56.506
WITH THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU'S.

02:41:56.573 --> 02:41:57.874
POVERTY INDEX WHICH INCLUDES THE

02:41:57.941 --> 02:41:59.443
SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY INDEX

02:41:59.509 --> 02:42:01.178
INCLUDES THE COST OF LIVING.

02:42:01.244 --> 02:42:02.479
AND I'LL YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE

02:42:02.546 --> 02:42:03.680
WORST POVERTY OF ANY STATE

02:42:03.747 --> 02:42:04.815
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IS

02:42:04.881 --> 02:42:05.949
THAT DISPARITY IN LIVING COSTS

02:42:06.016 --> 02:42:06.950
SO THAT THAT'S. I JUST WANT TO

02:42:07.017 --> 02:42:07.884
BE CLEAR ABOUT FEEL FREE WITH

02:42:07.951 --> 02:42:09.453
OUR DISCUSSION HERE WITH BUT

02:42:09.519 --> 02:42:10.087
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHETHER

02:42:10.153 --> 02:42:11.221
NOT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO

02:42:11.288 --> 02:42:12.656
CLEAN DRINKING WATER THINK WE

02:42:12.722 --> 02:42:13.957
ALL AGREE THAT THEY SHOULD. WE

02:42:14.024 --> 02:42:16.460
TALK ABOUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT AND

02:42:16.526 --> 02:42:17.394
I WOULD HOPE THAT.

02:42:17.461 --> 02:42:18.395
FOR SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

02:42:18.462 --> 02:42:20.030
ACKNOWLEDGE IS A FUNDAMENTAL

02:42:20.097 --> 02:42:21.398
HUMAN RIGHT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:42:21.465 --> 02:42:22.499
FIND ROOM FOR THAT IN OTHER

02:42:22.566 --> 02:42:23.967
PLACES IN THE BUDGET.

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:25.702
THIS IS OUR JOB ON THIS

02:42:25.769 --> 02:42:27.204
COMMITTEE IS TO PRIORITIZE STATE

02:42:27.270 --> 02:42:28.472
GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND I THINK

02:42:28.538 --> 02:42:30.474
THAT.

02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:31.374
AFFORD TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE

02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:32.776
DRINKING WATER SHOULD BE HIGH UP

02:42:32.843 --> 02:42:34.678
ON THE LIST HIGH ENOUGH UP ON

02:42:34.744 --> 02:42:35.946
THE LIST THAT WE DON'T NEED TO

02:42:36.012 --> 02:42:36.980
PROVIDE PROOF TO OUR.

02:42:37.047 --> 02:42:38.315
PROPOSE ANOTHER TAX TO PAY FOR

02:42:38.381 --> 02:42:41.718
IT.

02:42:41.785 --> 02:42:44.187
THANK YOU SARAH.

MEANS MY UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE.

02:42:51.595 --> 02:42:53.230
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

02:42:53.296 --> 02:42:55.065
THREE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND OF

02:42:55.132 --> 02:42:56.466
THESE SMALL WATER AGENCIES IN

02:42:56.533 --> 02:42:58.235
THE STATE THAT.

02:42:58.301 --> 02:42:59.369
HAVE FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED

02:42:59.436 --> 02:43:02.005
CUSTOMERS.

02:43:02.072 --> 02:43:03.507
I'M HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME

02:43:03.573 --> 02:43:05.175
GETTING MY ARMS AROUND EXACTLY

02:43:05.242 --> 02:43:06.810

PROPOSAL IS GOING TO DO I HEAR

02:43:08.912 --> 02:43:11.014
OWING HIM.

02:43:11.081 --> 02:43:12.482
IT'S NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION IT'S

02:43:12.549 --> 02:43:14.618
NOT FOR DIGGING NEW WELLS IT'S

02:43:14.684 --> 02:43:16.686
NOT FOR REPLACING.

02:43:16.753 --> 02:43:18.722
DETERIORATING PLATE.

02:43:18.788 --> 02:43:20.257
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:43:20.323 --> 02:43:24.027
WHO'S GOT THE STICK HERE.

02:43:24.094 --> 02:43:26.229
SO REGULATORY FINE AS AS EARLIER

02:43:26.296 --> 02:43:26.830
DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE FUNDING

02:43:26.897 --> 02:43:29.065
AVAILABLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT.

02:43:29.132 --> 02:43:31.768
THE REMAINING PIECE THAT MANY

02:43:31.835 --> 02:43:33.003
COMMITTEES.

02:43:33.069 --> 02:43:34.304
DON'T QUALIFY PREFERRED DOCTOR

02:43:34.371 --> 02:43:34.971
FUNDING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

02:43:35.038 --> 02:43:35.672
THE.

02:43:35.739 --> 02:43:37.541
SUPPORT FOR OPERATIONS AND

02:43:37.607 --> 02:43:39.576
MAINTENANCE AND SO NOW THIS

02:43:39.643 --> 02:43:44.281
PROPOSAL IS PRIMARILY TO HAVE

02:43:44.347 --> 02:43:46.049
THE FUNDS GO FOR OPERATIONS AND

02:43:46.116 --> 02:43:46.917
MAINTENANCE. THAT WILL THEN

02:43:46.983 --> 02:43:47.584
FACILITATE THE COMMUNITIES TO BE

02:43:47.651 --> 02:43:48.585
ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE

02:43:48.652 --> 02:43:50.053
INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING SO UGLY

02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:50.820
THEY ARE ABLE TO GET THE

02:43:50.887 --> 02:43:53.056
INFRASTRUCTURE THAN TO MAINTAIN

02:43:53.123 --> 02:43:55.225
AND OPERATE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:43:55.292 --> 02:43:57.561
WELL FOR EXAMPLE MEAN.

02:43:57.627 --> 02:43:59.362
WHO WHO'S COLLECTING THIS MONEY

02:43:59.429 --> 02:43:59.963
AS IT WERE DOING THIS ON A

02:44:00.030 --> 02:44:00.630
STATEWIDE BASIS IS AT THE STATE

02:44:00.697 --> 02:44:04.701
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD?

02:44:04.768 --> 02:44:05.936
SO.

02:44:06.002 --> 02:44:08.238
CD OF THE. HAD THE BAR FOOD AND

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:09.439
AGRICULTURE COLLECTING THE

02:44:09.506 --> 02:44:11.241
THROUGH THE AGRICULTURE XP YOUTH

02:44:11.308 --> 02:44:14.077
AND THEN THE WATER HAD ENTITIES

02:44:14.144 --> 02:44:15.212
WATER AGENCIES WILL BE

02:44:15.278 --> 02:44:17.514
COLLECTING THE THIEVES ON THE

02:44:17.581 --> 02:44:20.083
RATE PAYERS WHICH WILL THEN I GO

02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:21.051
TO THE STATE.

02:44:21.117 --> 02:44:23.486
TO THE STATE WHO IN THE STATE.

02:44:23.553 --> 02:44:25.255
IT BE THAT THE WATER BOARD WOULD

02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:26.223
BE THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE

02:44:26.289 --> 02:44:27.691
PROGRAM A ONE RESOURCES CONTROL

02:44:27.757 --> 02:44:28.992
BOARD YES.

02:44:29.059 --> 02:44:30.427
OKAY SO THEN HOW DOES THE MONEY

02:44:30.493 --> 02:44:31.361
GET DISTRIBUTED BACK DOWN TO THE

02:44:31.428 --> 02:44:34.030
WATER DISTRICT.

02:44:34.097 --> 02:44:35.232
SO THAT WOULD BE THROUGH EITHER

02:44:35.298 --> 02:44:37.567
DIFFERENT GRANT OR LOAN PROGRAMS

02:44:37.634 --> 02:44:40.103
THAT THE WATER BOARD READ MISTER

02:44:40.170 --> 02:44:43.006
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE.

02:44:43.073 --> 02:44:44.841
COMMUNITY THEY NEED ONE OF THEM

02:44:44.908 --> 02:44:45.542
LISTEN LIKE I I'VE BEEN INVOLVED

02:44:45.609 --> 02:44:47.110
IN TRYING TO FIX WATER PROBLEMS

02:44:47.177 --> 02:44:48.612
AS SOME OF YOU KNOW FOR SMALL

02:44:48.678 --> 02:44:49.779
DISTRICTS DOWN IN SOUTHERN

02:44:49.846 --> 02:44:51.014
CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFICULT

02:44:51.081 --> 02:44:52.315
ISSUE.

02:44:52.382 --> 02:44:53.283
SELECT COMMANDMENT RATIONS FOR

02:44:53.350 --> 02:44:54.618
THIS EFFORT.

02:44:54.684 --> 02:44:56.820
BUT.

02:44:56.886 --> 02:44:58.555
IF YOU HAVE A WATER DISTRICT WAS

02:44:58.622 --> 02:45:00.023
SEVENTY FIVE CUSTOMERS HOW

02:45:00.090 --> 02:45:01.625
LIKELY IS IT THAT THE WATER

02:45:01.691 --> 02:45:02.692
DISTRICTS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:45:02.759 --> 02:45:04.327
SUBMIT UP TO DRAFT AND SUBMIT AN

APPROPRIATE GRANT TO GET MONEY.

02:45:07.130 --> 02:45:08.198
HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT A WATER

02:45:08.265 --> 02:45:09.833
DISTRICT IS GONNA KNOW WHAT TO

02:45:09.899 --> 02:45:11.101
DO WITH THE MONEY?

02:45:11.167 --> 02:45:12.502
ONCE THEY GET THE MONEY.

02:45:12.569 --> 02:45:14.004
IF THERE PLATE.

02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:15.538
REPLACEMENTS IN REPAIRS THAT

02:45:15.605 --> 02:45:17.274
NEED TO BE DONE HOW LIKELY IS

02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:18.408
THAT THE SMALL WATER DISTRICTS

02:45:18.475 --> 02:45:20.043
CAN HAVE A QUALIFIED WATER

02:45:20.110 --> 02:45:23.880
ENGINEER. OR INAPPROPRIATE.

02:45:23.947 --> 02:45:25.382
CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER. OR

02:45:25.448 --> 02:45:27.083
TECHNICIAN THAT'S GOING AND KNOW

02:45:27.150 --> 02:45:29.185
HOW TO MANAGE THE MONEY IF A

02:45:29.252 --> 02:45:30.654
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS OF

02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:32.055
MAINTENANCE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT

02:45:32.122 --> 02:45:33.823
IS REQUIRED HOW LIKELY IS IT A

02:45:33.890 --> 02:45:36.126
SMALL DISTRICT WAS SEVENTY FIVE

02:45:36.192 --> 02:45:36.726
CUSTOMERS IS GOING TO KNOW HOW

02:45:36.793 --> 02:45:37.627
TO.

02:45:37.694 --> 02:45:40.363
AT THE HEAD OF PLAN DESIGN

02:45:40.430 --> 02:45:43.133
MANAGED TO CONSTRUCTION REPAIR.

02:45:43.199 --> 02:45:47.203
I I AND AGAIN.

02:45:47.270 --> 02:45:48.738
I GUESS THAT'S MORE COMMON AND

02:45:48.805 --> 02:45:50.273
LET'S NOT A FAIR QUESTION.

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.676
BUT YOU CAN SEE MY CONCERN AND

02:45:52.742 --> 02:45:55.645
INSTEAD OF DESIGNING THIS.

02:45:55.712 --> 02:45:57.414
BONTA REGIONALIZED BASIS WHERE

02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:00.317
YOU ENCOURAGE IF NOT REQUIRE.

02:46:00.383 --> 02:46:01.751
DR. COLLABORATION AND

02:46:01.818 --> 02:46:03.687
COOPERATION BETWEEN REGIONAL

02:46:03.753 --> 02:46:05.088
WATER AGENCIES TO TRY TO FIX

02:46:05.155 --> 02:46:06.990
PROBLEMS.

02:46:07.057 --> 02:46:08.391
IN SMALL WATER DISTRICTS WITHIN

02:46:08.458 --> 02:46:10.327
A REGION.

02:46:10.393 --> 02:46:11.628
INSTEAD OF DESIGNING IT IN THAT

02:46:11.695 --> 02:46:13.596
WAY WHERE PEOPLE WHOSE WATER

02:46:13.663 --> 02:46:14.631
BILLS ARE GOING TO GO UP A

02:46:14.698 --> 02:46:16.232
DOLLAR A MONTH.

02:46:16.299 --> 02:46:18.401
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS REALLY

02:46:18.468 --> 02:46:19.836
NOT ABOUT GIVING A BUNCH OF

02:46:19.903 --> 02:46:21.271
MONEY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:46:21.338 --> 02:46:22.572
AND MORE ABOUT MUTUAL AID IN

02:46:22.639 --> 02:46:24.474
PART.

IN IN HELPING YOUR NEIGHBOR GET

02:46:26.609 --> 02:46:28.111
CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

02:46:28.178 --> 02:46:29.946
WE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

02:46:30.013 --> 02:46:31.781
SELLING THIS

02:46:31.848 --> 02:46:33.516
TO PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE IN INLAND

02:46:33.583 --> 02:46:34.884
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE

02:46:34.951 --> 02:46:36.152
JUST HAD THEIR WATER RATES

02:46:36.219 --> 02:46:38.121

EUREKA NOTHING AGAINST EUREKA

THAT.

02:47:04.481 --> 02:47:06.216
CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT REALLY

AT SOME POINT THAT WILL BE

02:50:23.346 --> 02:50:26.282
REMEDY AT SOME LEVEL.

02:50:26.349 --> 02:50:28.084
AT THAT POINT THEY'RE SHOULD BE

02:50:28.151 --> 02:50:29.385
A PROVISION IN HERE THAT THE TAX

TAXES ARE FOREVER.

02:50:47.370 --> 02:50:48.171
AND THE BOARD WOULD HAVE THE

02:50:48.237 --> 02:50:51.074
AUTHORITY TO RAISE THOSE TAXES.

02:50:51.140 --> 02:50:52.742
THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN MANY

02:50:52.809 --> 02:50:55.878
BOARDS THE AUTHORITY DERANGED.

02:50:55.945 --> 02:50:57.380

THERE CAN BE.

02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:28.778
DEBATE OVER WHETHER IT SHOULD

02:51:28.845 --> 02:51:30.713
BE A POLICY BILL OR.

02:51:30.780 --> 02:51:32.382

YOU HAVE THE TABLE IN YOUR

02:52:15.391 --> 02:52:15.858
GENDER OF THE DIFFERENCES

02:52:15.925 --> 02:52:17.193
BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES. THINK

02:52:17.260 --> 02:52:18.294
WHAT I WOULD PROBABLY JUST WANNA

02:52:18.361 --> 02:52:19.228
HIGHLIGHT IS IS THE TOTAL

02:52:19.295 --> 02:52:20.530
NUMBERS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF

02:52:20.596 --> 02:52:21.631
THE TABLE.

02:52:21.698 --> 02:52:22.865
GOVERNOR PROPOSED ONE POINT

02:52:22.932 --> 02:52:24.467
THREE BILLION.

02:52:24.534 --> 02:52:26.069
THE ASSEMBLY OF RUN A TWO

02:52:26.135 --> 02:52:27.437
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION MORE AND

02:52:27.503 --> 02:52:27.904
THE SENATE.

02:52:27.970 --> 02:52:29.338
ABOUT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

02:52:29.405 --> 02:52:31.541
MORE AND I THINK OUR GENERAL

02:52:31.607 --> 02:52:33.076
COMMENT AS WE WOULD RECOMMEND AN

02:52:33.142 --> 02:52:34.477
AMOUNT CLOSER TO WHAT THE SENATE.

02:52:34.544 --> 02:52:37.680
ADOPTED JUST GIVEN THE REVENUE

02:52:37.747 --> 02:52:39.015
UNCERTAINTY AROUND THIS PROGRAM

02:52:39.082 --> 02:52:40.817
JUST FOR CONTEXT IF REVENUE IN

02:52:40.883 --> 02:52:41.751
THE BUDGET YEAR IS.

02:52:41.818 --> 02:52:43.720
TWO POINT NINE BILLION WHICH IS

02:52:43.786 --> 02:52:44.387
WHAT IT WAS OF THIS CURRENT YEAR

02:52:44.454 --> 02:52:46.089
IN WHAT. WE THINK IS REASONABLE

02:52:46.155 --> 02:52:47.623
FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. UNDER THE

02:52:47.690 --> 02:52:48.491
SENATE AMOUNT THAT WOULD LEAVE

02:52:48.558 --> 02:52:49.959
ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:51.694
OR SO AS THE FUND BALANCE AND SO

02:52:51.761 --> 02:52:52.762
WE THINK GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY

02:52:52.829 --> 02:52:54.931
THAT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH ONE

02:52:54.997 --> 02:52:56.232
OTHER THING ON THE UNCERTAINTY.

02:52:56.299 --> 02:52:58.468

REDUCE THE ALLOCATIONS OF

02:53:05.108 --> 02:53:06.809
REVENUE CAME IN LOWER AS PART OF

02:53:06.876 --> 02:53:08.945

OVERLY OPTIMISTIC REVENUE

02:53:43.312 --> 02:53:44.547
ASSUMPTIONS THAT EACH HOUSE

THE CONTEXT OF CAP AND TRADE I'M

02:53:58.795 --> 02:54:00.663
AND SO CLEARLY THAT WAS NOT

02:54:00.730 --> 02:54:02.064

03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:25.848
WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

03:00:25.915 --> 03:00:28.951
TO CODIFY IT.

03:00:29.018 --> 03:00:29.852
IT MEANS THAT IT'S INCLUDED IN

03:00:29.919 --> 03:00:31.887
STATUTE.

03:00:31.954 --> 03:00:34.223

ORDER ANY.

03:00:46.936 --> 03:00:48.270
AND WHAT.

03:00:48.337 --> 03:00:50.239
I THINK A ASSEMBLY ACTION DOES

03:00:50.306 --> 03:00:51.640
IS IT.

03:00:51.707 --> 03:00:54.009
IT IT'S THE OTHER BRANCH ANOTHER

03:00:54.076 --> 03:00:55.611
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT.

03:00:55.678 --> 03:00:57.046
MEMORIALIZING THEIR.

03:00:57.112 --> 03:00:58.881
COMMITMENT TO THE SINGLE THAT

03:00:58.948 --> 03:00:59.949

I GOT I GOT I UNDERSTAND THAT

03:01:06.288 --> 03:01:08.424
MEANS THE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

03:01:08.490 --> 03:01:10.326
SO MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR.

03:01:10.392 --> 03:01:11.794
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE REBATES I

03:01:11.860 --> 03:01:12.828
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT DOES YOU

03:01:12.895 --> 03:01:14.930
KNOW CODIFYING A GOAL IS BECAUSE

03:01:14.997 --> 03:01:16.232
GOT MORE NEBULOUS AND AND REALLY

03:01:16.298 --> 03:01:17.533
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE MERITS OF

03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:19.301
IT. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A

03:01:19.368 --> 03:01:20.869
PRETTY WEIGHTY POLICY DISCUSSION

03:01:20.936 --> 03:01:21.804
I REALLY DON'T THINK IT HAS A

03:01:21.870 --> 03:01:23.239
PLACE IN THE BUDGET I'D RATHER

03:01:23.305 --> 03:01:24.673
TALK ABOUT THE DOLLARS AND SENSE

03:01:24.740 --> 03:01:30.279
OF WHERE MONEY GOES.

03:01:30.346 --> 03:01:32.181
SO SINCE IT'S OUR TRUE GODDESS I

03:01:32.248 --> 03:01:33.515
LITTLE CLARITY SO.

03:01:33.582 --> 03:01:35.451
DOT IDEAS GIVEN HOW MANY

03:01:35.517 --> 03:01:37.219
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

03:01:37.286 --> 03:01:38.654
WHERE INVESTING I THINK THE

03:01:38.721 --> 03:01:40.489
QUESTION IS IS WHAT IS THE

03:01:40.556 --> 03:01:42.458
ULTIMATE END GOAL AT SOME POINT

03:01:42.524 --> 03:01:45.027
IS THERE IS IS THERE AN END TO

03:01:45.094 --> 03:01:46.762
THAT SO I THINK THE GOAL WAS?

03:01:46.829 --> 03:01:46.929
TO.

03:01:46.996 --> 03:01:48.097
.

03:01:48.163 --> 03:01:50.165
APPROPRIATE.

03:01:50.232 --> 03:01:52.001
THE UNDERSERVED A FIVE BUT WITH

03:01:52.067 --> 03:01:54.870

FIVE MILLION VEHICLE GOAL BY

03:01:57.373 --> 03:01:58.407
TWENTY THIRTY SO THAT I THINK

03:01:58.474 --> 03:02:01.277
THAT'S AWESOME.

03:02:01.343 --> 03:02:03.245
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A GOLD

03:02:03.312 --> 03:02:05.281
OKAY WELL BUT IT'S THAT I KINDA

03:02:05.347 --> 03:02:06.415
MISS SITTING ON SUB THREE

03:02:06.482 --> 03:02:06.982
BECAUSE I USED TO BE PART OF

03:02:07.049 --> 03:02:08.751
THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

03:02:08.817 --> 03:02:11.620
YOU'RE WELCOME BACK INTO THE.

03:02:11.687 --> 03:02:13.922

SKINNER NOT THAT WE DON'T LOVE

03:02:19.161 --> 03:02:19.428
OUR CURRENT.

03:02:19.495 --> 03:02:20.095
.

03:02:20.162 --> 03:02:21.597
STORY COUPLE QUESTIONS.

03:02:21.664 --> 03:02:22.731
DISCUSSED WHEN YOU WERE

03:02:22.798 --> 03:02:24.199

SOME OF THE FUNDS YOU ARE

03:02:25.367 --> 03:02:27.169
REFERENCING WORD ARE NOT CAP AND

03:02:27.236 --> 03:02:29.071
TRADE FUNDS CORRECT SO THEY

03:02:29.138 --> 03:02:30.839
INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS ARE GENERAL

03:02:30.906 --> 03:02:32.675
FUND IS THAT RIGHT FOR ELECTRIC

03:02:32.741 --> 03:02:33.909
VEHICLE CHARGING OR THEY FROM A

03:02:33.976 --> 03:02:35.244
DIFFERENT SOURCE.

03:02:35.311 --> 03:02:36.779
IF THE ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE

03:02:36.845 --> 03:02:38.781
FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY FUND

03:02:38.847 --> 03:02:40.215
SO THAT'S FROM.

03:02:40.282 --> 03:02:43.652
YOU KNOW WHAT THE.

03:02:43.719 --> 03:02:44.787
THE SHORT HAND IT WOULD BE AB

03:02:44.853 --> 03:02:47.656
ONE EIGHTEEN.

03:02:47.723 --> 03:02:48.524
ANYWAY.

03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:49.758
THERE'S NEVER.

03:02:49.825 --> 03:02:52.161
.

03:02:52.227 --> 03:02:55.664
BUT THAT'S NOT IN THE LIST

03:02:55.731 --> 03:02:56.065
OF.

03:02:56.131 --> 03:02:58.267
AYE ALLOCATIONS THAT WE'RE

03:02:58.334 --> 03:02:59.168

CAP AND TRADE FUNDS.

03:03:01.904 --> 03:03:05.007
SO IT'S NOT PARTY GREENHOUSE GAS.

03:03:05.074 --> 03:03:05.908
REDUCTION FOR YEAH I LIVE THE

03:03:05.974 --> 03:03:07.276
REASON WHY WERE.

SPEAK

03:03:14.350 --> 03:03:16.085
SO THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE

03:03:16.151 --> 03:03:17.653
INITIATIVE THERE'S KIND OF TWO

03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:18.954

CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE A VEHICLE

03:03:22.858 --> 03:03:24.526
THEN THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:03:24.593 --> 03:03:25.761
THE REBATE.

03:03:27.096 --> 03:03:29.631

INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:03:40.676 --> 03:03:43.078
YEP SO ONE SEVENTY FIVE YEAH SO.

03:03:43.145 --> 03:03:44.580
THE CLARIFICATION THERE IS A

03:03:44.646 --> 03:03:45.914
ONE SEVENTY FIVE IS FOR THE

03:03:45.981 --> 03:03:47.683
CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT IN

03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:48.484
WITHIN.

03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:50.319
THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION

03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:53.455
LOW INCOME.

03:03:53.522 --> 03:03:56.158
THOUGHT EQUITY PROGRAMS

03:05:26.482 --> 03:05:27.883
ALL RECOMMENDING A PRETTY HIGH

03:05:27.950 --> 03:05:29.184
NUMBER IN HERE WHAT WE.

03:05:29.251 --> 03:05:31.019
JOHN WE'LL SEE.

03:05:31.086 --> 03:05:32.521
BUT I THINK THE BENEFIT OF

03:05:32.588 --> 03:05:34.723
HAVING THE GOLAN STATUTE IS THEN

03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:37.159
AT LEAST WERE DIRECTING.

03:05:37.226 --> 03:05:38.260
WHEN WE AUTHORIZE FUNDING.

03:05:38.327 --> 03:05:40.329
.

03:05:40.395 --> 03:05:41.763
IT GIVES THE AGENCIES WERE

03:05:41.830 --> 03:05:43.732
ADMINISTERING IT MORE DIRECTION

03:05:43.799 --> 03:05:45.334
AS TO OUR EIGHT WHAT IS THE GOAL

03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:47.069
THAT WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

03:05:47.135 --> 03:05:47.870
WITH THIS FUNDING THAT WE HAVE

03:05:47.936 --> 03:05:49.505
AUTHORIZED.

03:05:49.571 --> 03:05:51.173
AND THEN THEY CAN DESIGN THE

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:53.842
PROGRAM TO HELP US MOST. THAT

03:05:53.909 --> 03:05:55.677
GOAL SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY

03:05:55.744 --> 03:05:57.412
WISE BECAUSE APPROVING.

03:05:57.479 --> 03:05:59.715

IT'S GREAT TO.

03:06:00.616 --> 03:06:03.085
APPROVED BUDGETARY FUNDS BUT

03:06:03.151 --> 03:06:05.153
MANY TIMES IF WE TAKE OUR PROP

03:06:05.220 --> 03:06:06.722
NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES FOR

03:06:06.788 --> 03:06:08.056
EXAMPLE THEIR STATUTE ALREADY

03:06:08.123 --> 03:06:11.393
THAT EXISTS THAT IS. GUIDING THE

03:06:11.460 --> 03:06:12.995
EXPENDITURE OF THAT MONEY AND

03:06:13.061 --> 03:06:15.030
THE BENEFIT OF ADDING. THE.

03:06:15.097 --> 03:06:17.466
THAT GOAL IS THAT IT WILL ONCE

03:06:17.533 --> 03:06:19.535
AGAIN GUY THE EXPENDITURE OF THE

03:06:19.601 --> 03:06:22.204
MONEY SO I WOULD SUPPORT IT.

WE'RE WE'RE SPENDING.

03:06:30.779 --> 03:06:32.648
OR BUDGETING A LOT OF MONEY FOR

03:06:32.714 --> 03:06:35.817
THE END. USAGE A EIGHT HUNDRED

03:06:35.884 --> 03:06:37.553
AND TEN MILLION FOR RECHARGING

03:06:37.619 --> 03:06:39.655
STATIONS.

03:06:39.721 --> 03:06:42.257
SALAS ELECTRICITY HAS TO GO

03:06:42.324 --> 03:06:44.159
SOMEWHERE HAS TO COME FROM

03:06:44.226 --> 03:06:45.627
SOMEWHERE HAS TO BE. TRANSPORTED

03:06:45.694 --> 03:06:46.261
IN.

03:06:46.328 --> 03:06:48.163
AND I THINK YOU

03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:49.364
ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWO.

03:06:49.431 --> 03:06:51.333
HAS A BLIND SPOT IN THAT IT

03:06:51.400 --> 03:06:52.734
DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE

03:06:52.801 --> 03:06:54.403
GREENHOUSE GASES.

03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:56.171
THAT ARE CREATED BY ALL THESE

03:06:56.238 --> 03:06:57.306
WILDFIRES THAT WE'RE TALKING

03:06:57.372 --> 03:06:59.007
ABOUT I'D I DON'T SEE A STRONG

03:06:59.074 --> 03:07:01.443
ENOUGH EMPHASIS IN TRYING TO.

03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:03.178
HARDEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

03:07:03.245 --> 03:07:05.347
OUR ELECTRICITY TRANSPORTATION

03:07:05.414 --> 03:07:06.715
WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

03:07:06.782 --> 03:07:11.587
TRANSPORTING COAL. GAS DIESEL.

03:07:11.653 --> 03:07:13.021
JET FUEL AB WOULD.

03:07:13.088 --> 03:07:14.556
WE KNOW WE HAVE TO LEARN

03:07:14.623 --> 03:07:15.824
SOMETHING FROM SANOMA AND SANTA

03:07:15.891 --> 03:07:17.092
ROSA.

03:07:17.159 --> 03:07:19.027
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET A

03:07:19.094 --> 03:07:20.596
WINDY CONDITION AND.

03:07:20.662 --> 03:07:22.798
IT IS TAKES TWO AND A HALF DAYS

03:07:22.864 --> 03:07:24.266
OF WILDFIRES AND YOU'VE WIPED

03:07:24.333 --> 03:07:25.968
OUT ALL YOUR. GREENHOUSE GAS

03:07:26.034 --> 03:07:28.670
STATS.

03:07:28.737 --> 03:07:29.871
ALL THIS HARD WORK ALL THIS

03:07:29.938 --> 03:07:32.207
REDIRECTION ALL THIS EFFORT AND

03:07:32.274 --> 03:07:34.209
FOR NOT SO. I'D I'D LIKE TO SEE

03:07:34.276 --> 03:07:35.310
A LITTLE MORE.

03:07:35.377 --> 03:07:37.746
IN THE WAY OF FUNDING.

03:07:37.813 --> 03:07:39.081
TO HARDEN THE ASSETS NOT TAKE

03:07:39.147 --> 03:07:40.248
ALL THE SAID PENALIZE ALL THE

03:07:40.315 --> 03:07:42.584
UTILITY. RATEPAYERS.

03:07:42.651 --> 03:07:43.852
BUT WE SHOULD BE USING SOME OF

03:07:43.919 --> 03:07:45.821
THIS CAP AND TRADE. TO MAKE SURE

03:07:45.887 --> 03:07:47.022
THAT WE PREVENT FIRES FROM

03:07:47.089 --> 03:07:48.590
OCCURRING.

03:07:48.657 --> 03:07:50.092
WITH THESE ELECTRICAL LINES SO

03:07:50.158 --> 03:07:51.526
THAT YOU CAN REDUCE YOUR

03:07:51.593 --> 03:07:54.196
GREENHOUSE GAS.

03:07:54.262 --> 03:07:55.764
AND TRANSPORT THE ELECTRICITY

03:07:55.831 --> 03:07:56.999
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT TEST

03:07:57.065 --> 03:07:59.001
FOOT TRUCKS NOW IT TAKES THE

03:07:59.067 --> 03:08:01.169
SAME AMOUNT OF POWER. TO

03:08:01.236 --> 03:08:03.038
GENERATE A LOT AT THE TOYOTA

03:08:03.105 --> 03:08:03.605
LECTURE FIVE THREE THOUSAND

03:08:03.672 --> 03:08:04.606
HOMES

03:08:04.673 --> 03:08:06.241
JUST TO RECHARGE ONE TRUCK FOR

03:08:06.308 --> 03:08:07.709
LIKE THREE HUNDRED MILES SO.

03:08:07.776 --> 03:08:08.644
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN

03:08:08.710 --> 03:08:10.979
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY

03:08:11.046 --> 03:08:11.980
EIGHT UNEVEN STATISTICALLY

03:08:12.047 --> 03:08:13.782
NOVICA MOVE AT ALL. AT TO WHERE

03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:15.851
YOU WANT TO GET IT TO GO SO I I

03:08:15.917 --> 03:08:18.086
WOULD THINK. WE SHOULD BE

03:08:18.153 --> 03:08:19.621
REVAMPING THIS LIST.

03:08:19.688 --> 03:08:22.290
WE'RE ALLOCATING THE HUNDRED.

03:08:22.357 --> 03:08:22.958
AND SEE WHAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION

03:08:23.025 --> 03:08:25.160
TO FIRE.

03:08:25.227 --> 03:08:26.361
LOOK AT FIRE RESPONSE BUT WE

03:08:26.428 --> 03:08:28.764
SHOULD BE ALLOCATING PROBABLY.

03:08:28.830 --> 03:08:31.333
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.

03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:32.701
AB ADOPT ONE POINT THREE BILLION

03:08:32.768 --> 03:08:33.735
FOR SERIOUS ABOUT GREENHOUSE

03:08:33.802 --> 03:08:35.037
GASES.

03:08:35.103 --> 03:08:37.172
SO I I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT

03:08:37.239 --> 03:08:39.508
IN RICHARD SURE. OBVIOUSLY NOT

03:08:39.574 --> 03:08:41.643
HERE FOR DEBATE CLUB BUT. I I

03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:43.311
THINK WE'RE WE'RE NOT.

TO PREVENT.

03:08:48.183 --> 03:08:50.752
S. FIRES.

FIVE MILLION THAT YOU HAD

03:09:07.335 --> 03:09:09.137
REFERENCED AS WELL AS OVER TWO

03:09:09.204 --> 03:09:10.405

PLAN OF PROJECTS THE.

03:09:15.977 --> 03:09:18.714
THAT IDENTIFIES KIND OF.

03:09:18.780 --> 03:09:20.816
THE TREE MORTALITY CRISIS

03:09:20.882 --> 03:09:22.384
THAT'S GOING ON AND TRIES TO

03:09:22.451 --> 03:09:24.052
REDUCE THE WILD VIRUS ASSOCIATE

03:09:24.119 --> 03:09:25.287
WITH THAT.

03:09:25.353 --> 03:09:26.421

BE REEVALUATED.

03:09:37.032 --> 03:09:38.166
IF WAS SINCERE ABOUT REDUCING

03:09:38.233 --> 03:09:39.935
GREENHOUSE GASES.

03:09:40.001 --> 03:09:40.702
THE GODDESS ARE LOOKING AT HOW

03:09:40.769 --> 03:09:41.703
WE MOVE THIS ELECTRICITY AROUND

03:12:00.242 --> 03:12:01.977
DONE.

03:12:02.043 --> 03:12:04.813
THE.

03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:07.115
LAST THURSDAY THE CPU CA IN THIS

03:12:07.182 --> 03:12:08.683
A FOR THE LA SHOW.

03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:10.852
VOTER TO INVEST EIGHT HUNDRED

03:12:10.919 --> 03:12:11.620
MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLE

03:12:11.686 --> 03:12:14.289
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:12:14.356 --> 03:12:16.124
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

03:12:16.191 --> 03:12:18.093
HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH?

03:12:18.159 --> 03:12:19.561
THE

03:12:19.628 --> 03:12:21.396
A WHOLE PICTURE.

03:12:21.463 --> 03:12:22.797
OF EVERY STRUCTURE IN REBATE

03:12:22.864 --> 03:12:24.666
WITH VEHICLES.

03:12:24.733 --> 03:12:25.934
UNDERSTAND WE'RE TRYING TO GET

03:12:26.001 --> 03:12:26.401
TO THIS GOAL OF HAVE.

03:12:26.468 --> 03:12:27.936
.

03:12:28.003 --> 03:12:29.871
MORE LAUGHTER VEHICLES BUT I WAS

03:12:29.938 --> 03:12:30.405
AT WORK OUT OF THE TO WORK

03:12:30.472 --> 03:12:32.908
TOGETHER.

03:12:32.974 --> 03:12:35.010
SO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A

03:12:35.076 --> 03:12:36.544
LARGE CHUNK OF THE.

03:12:36.611 --> 03:12:38.313
RESOURCES THAT WERE APPROVED BY

03:12:38.380 --> 03:12:40.749
TWO UC WOULD GO TOWARDS MEDIUM

03:12:40.815 --> 03:12:42.918
AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE CHARGING

03:12:42.984 --> 03:12:44.819
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO THAT'S A

03:12:44.886 --> 03:12:45.987
ONE OF THE BIG FOCUS IS OF THAT.

03:12:47.489 --> 03:12:48.390
I I THINK THERE ARE.

03:12:48.456 --> 03:12:50.392
SOME QUESTIONS AROUND EXACTLY

03:12:50.458 --> 03:12:51.927
SORT OF HOW THE DIFFERENT PIECES

03:12:51.993 --> 03:12:53.261
LE WOULD BE COORDINATED THE

03:12:53.328 --> 03:12:55.830
DIFFERENT PIECES OF FUNDING FROM

03:12:55.897 --> 03:12:56.765
THE ENERGY COMMISSION PROGRAM

03:12:56.831 --> 03:12:58.233
THAT IS WAS A PIECE SEIZE

03:12:58.300 --> 03:13:00.101
PROGRAM. SAWS ARE SOME FUNDING.

03:13:00.168 --> 03:13:02.103
THROUGH THE VW SETTLEMENT

03:13:02.170 --> 03:13:03.438
THAT'S GOING TO THE OUR MISSION

03:13:03.505 --> 03:13:04.940
VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:13:05.006 --> 03:13:06.841
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE.

03:13:06.908 --> 03:13:08.743
ADMINISTRATION IS IS VIEWING IT

03:13:08.810 --> 03:13:09.611
AS THE.

03:13:09.678 --> 03:13:10.779
FUNDING THAT THEY WERE TALKING

03:13:10.845 --> 03:13:11.579
ABOUT HERE THAT WOULD BE

03:13:11.646 --> 03:13:13.148
ADMINISTERED BY THE ENERGY

03:13:13.214 --> 03:13:14.950
COMMISSION WOULD BE USED TO

03:13:15.016 --> 03:13:16.651
ESSENTIALLY FILL IN GAPS.

03:13:16.718 --> 03:13:18.286
FOR SORT OF CHARGING VEHICLE

03:13:18.353 --> 03:13:19.287
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

03:13:19.354 --> 03:13:20.855
ISN'T PROVIDED THROUGH SOME OF

03:13:20.922 --> 03:13:22.424
THOSE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES.

03:13:22.490 --> 03:13:23.625
AND SO THEY WOULD.

03:13:23.692 --> 03:13:25.327
USER A PROCESS TO TRY TO SORT

03:13:25.393 --> 03:13:26.628
OF IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE OTHER

03:13:26.695 --> 03:13:29.197
PROGRAMS ARE FUNDING AND USE

03:13:29.264 --> 03:13:29.764
THIS FUND INTO TO FILL THOSE

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:29.965
GAPS.

03:13:30.031 --> 03:13:32.133
SO THE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING

03:13:32.200 --> 03:13:34.002
PROGRAM THAT DOES THAT TAKE CPUC

03:13:34.069 --> 03:13:35.470
DELAWARE.

03:13:35.537 --> 03:13:36.604
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK WOULD BE

03:13:36.671 --> 03:13:37.973
THE LIFE CYCLE INVESTMENT IN

03:13:38.039 --> 03:13:41.076
THESE INFRASTRUCTURE?

03:13:41.142 --> 03:13:41.943
SO WE'RE GONNA BUY INTO THESE

03:13:42.010 --> 03:13:44.112
STATIONS.

03:13:44.179 --> 03:13:45.880
ARE THEY GONNA IN TWENTY YEARS

03:13:45.947 --> 03:13:47.349
THIRTY YEARS FIVE YEARS ARE WE

03:13:47.415 --> 03:13:48.917
GOING TO HAVE TO REINVEST.

03:13:48.984 --> 03:13:50.585
AND THEN HOPPED OUT.

03:13:50.652 --> 03:13:51.519
WHAT WHAT DO WE TRYING TO BUILD

03:13:51.586 --> 03:13:54.389
THEIR HOUSE GOING TO BE THERE?

03:13:54.456 --> 03:13:55.957
YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M NOT

03:13:56.024 --> 03:13:58.159
QUITE SURE KIND OF HOW THEY HAVE

03:13:58.226 --> 03:14:00.061
KIND OF. THE LIFESPAN OF THE

03:14:00.128 --> 03:14:01.396
PARTICULAR ELECTRIC VEHICLE

03:14:01.463 --> 03:14:02.230
CHARGING.

03:14:02.297 --> 03:14:03.965
STATION IS.

03:14:04.032 --> 03:14:05.500
SOME OF THE FUNDING FOR THE C.

03:14:05.567 --> 03:14:07.469
C. GOES TO HYDROGEN FUELING

03:14:07.535 --> 03:14:08.903
INFRASTRUCTURES AND SO THOSE ARE.

03:14:08.970 --> 03:14:10.005
THOSE ARE SORT LARGER

03:14:10.071 --> 03:14:11.673
FACILITIES THAT I WOULD IMAGINE

03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:13.842
LAST. QUITE AWHILE AND NOT SURE

03:14:13.908 --> 03:14:15.944
IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A

03:14:16.011 --> 03:14:16.945
GREAT SENSE FIRST OR HOW LONG

03:14:17.012 --> 03:14:17.345
THE.

03:14:17.412 --> 03:14:19.214
THE STATIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO

03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:20.949
LAST.

03:14:21.016 --> 03:14:22.917
WHEN WE TOUCH ANOTHER ONE THEN.

03:14:22.984 --> 03:14:24.185
WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING MONEY INTO

03:14:24.252 --> 03:14:25.887
REBATES TO FOR PEOPLE TO GET

03:14:25.954 --> 03:14:27.989
THESE VEHICLES.

03:14:28.056 --> 03:14:29.491
THE INVESTMENT MAKING AND THESE

03:14:29.557 --> 03:14:30.792
VEHICLE WHAT'S A LIFE CYCLE OF A

03:14:30.859 --> 03:14:34.796
VEHICLE.

03:14:34.863 --> 03:14:35.397
AND I THINK YOU SEE WHERE I'M

03:14:35.463 --> 03:14:36.765
GOING RIGHT NOW.

03:14:36.831 --> 03:14:37.298
I.

03:14:37.365 --> 03:14:39.200
I MEAN I I THINK THE LIFE CYCLE

03:14:39.267 --> 03:14:40.869
OF THE VEHICLE COULD GO VERY BUT

03:14:40.935 --> 03:14:41.770
YEAH.

03:14:41.836 --> 03:14:44.339
FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO.

03:14:44.406 --> 03:14:45.473
IS AND.

03:14:45.540 --> 03:14:47.609
BUT I I'M NOT I'M NOT QUITE

03:14:47.675 --> 03:14:48.643
SURE AND I THINK IT DEPENDS ON

03:14:48.710 --> 03:14:50.045
THE ON THE DRIVER.

03:14:50.111 --> 03:14:51.579
I'M BADGES VEHICLES PROBABLY

03:14:51.646 --> 03:14:53.348
FIVE TO TEN YEARS SO WE WHAT I'M

03:14:53.415 --> 03:14:55.483
GETTING TO IS WHERE. I DON'T AND

03:14:55.550 --> 03:14:56.851
I'M ALL FORGET NOT CARBON OUT

03:14:56.918 --> 03:14:58.553
ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW I'M THE GUY

03:14:58.620 --> 03:15:00.088
THAT SAID YEAH YOU KNOW CLIMATE

03:15:00.155 --> 03:15:00.722
CHANGE REAL THING WAS DEAL WITH

03:15:00.789 --> 03:15:01.189
IT.

03:15:01.256 --> 03:15:02.657
BUT WHAT I'M HAVING A PROBLEM

03:15:02.724 --> 03:15:03.725
WITH HIS UNDERSTANDING NOW COULD

03:15:03.792 --> 03:15:05.627
REMOVE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THE A

03:15:05.693 --> 03:15:07.962
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

03:15:08.029 --> 03:15:08.563
IF WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THIS

03:15:08.630 --> 03:15:10.198
GOAL.

03:15:10.265 --> 03:15:12.100
WHO'S DRIVE AT NEW WHERE STEP

03:15:12.167 --> 03:15:13.835
PLANNED IS FOR GOING ON OKAY WE

03:15:13.902 --> 03:15:14.936
HAVE TO DO THE EVER STRUCTURE.

03:15:15.003 --> 03:15:15.804
WE HAVE WE WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:17.605
PRODUCTION OF ENERGY IS GOING TO

03:15:17.672 --> 03:15:19.207
GO INTO DECEMBER STRUCTURE. AND

03:15:19.274 --> 03:15:20.508
NEVER HAVE THESE VEHICLES GOING

03:15:20.575 --> 03:15:21.976
TO GO IN THERE. AND I WOULD

03:15:22.043 --> 03:15:23.511
IMAGINE.

03:15:23.578 --> 03:15:25.747
A LOT IS CAP AND TRADE MONEY IS

03:15:25.814 --> 03:15:26.514
GOING TO GO AWAY BY TWENTY

03:15:26.581 --> 03:15:27.749
THIRTY RIGHT THEM CAP AND TRADE

03:15:27.816 --> 03:15:29.350
GOES WAY.

03:15:29.417 --> 03:15:31.252
SO YEAH THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS

03:15:31.319 --> 03:15:32.520
AUTHORIZES THREW TWENTY THIRTY

03:15:32.587 --> 03:15:33.888
NINE AND SO.

03:15:33.955 --> 03:15:35.757
INVESTMENTS WERE TAKEN FOR THE

03:15:35.824 --> 03:15:38.226
CAP AND TRADE SEEMS TO ME.

03:15:38.293 --> 03:15:39.294
WOULD BE SUCH AS GOING TO GO

03:15:39.360 --> 03:15:41.296
AWAY.

03:15:41.362 --> 03:15:43.098
IT'S SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO YOU

03:15:43.164 --> 03:15:45.066
READ ABOUT THE STORY SOME MONTHS.

03:15:45.133 --> 03:15:46.935
SOME YEARS AGO THE ABOUT

03:15:47.001 --> 03:15:48.169
SCHOOL DISTRICTS USE IN BOND

03:15:48.236 --> 03:15:50.572
FUNDS TO BUY COMPUTERS.

03:15:50.638 --> 03:15:52.307
IN THE BOND FUND WAS FOR TWENTY

03:15:52.373 --> 03:15:54.242
YEARS OR FIFTEEN YEARS THIRTY

03:15:54.309 --> 03:15:55.510
YEARS OF THE COMPUTER ONLY LAST

03:15:55.577 --> 03:15:57.245
A FEW YEARS.

03:15:57.312 --> 03:15:58.413
SO SCHOOL THIS YEAR FOR MAKING

03:15:58.480 --> 03:16:00.248
DECISIONS BY THINGS THAT A VERY

03:16:00.315 --> 03:16:02.817
LOT LOW LIFE CYCLE I THINK WE'RE

03:16:02.884 --> 03:16:03.418
DOING THE SAME THING WITH CAP

03:16:03.485 --> 03:16:04.686
AND TRADE. WE'RE TAKING THE

03:16:04.752 --> 03:16:06.354
MONEY AND WE INVEST IN SOMETHING

03:16:06.421 --> 03:16:07.489
FOR REBATES.

03:16:07.555 --> 03:16:09.491
THEY HAVE A SHORT WINDOW OF

03:16:09.557 --> 03:16:11.025
RETURN ON INVESTMENTS PROBABLY

03:16:11.092 --> 03:16:12.393
MORE LIKE SMARTER ME ON THIS BUT

03:16:12.460 --> 03:16:13.761
THAT'S KIND I'M LOOKING AT IT.

03:16:13.828 --> 03:16:15.263
AND I THINK IN THAT WE SHOULD

03:16:15.330 --> 03:16:18.233
PROBABLY USE THE MONEY MOREAN.

03:16:18.299 --> 03:16:20.468
WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:16:20.535 --> 03:16:22.537
WITH THE CV CPUC WHAT THEY'RE

03:16:22.604 --> 03:16:23.204
GONNA DO AS I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE

03:16:23.271 --> 03:16:25.440
HIDDEN ALL THE INDUSTRY'S SDG

03:16:25.507 --> 03:16:27.408
PACKED EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD FACE

03:16:27.475 --> 03:16:28.076
HE'S GOING HIT ME THE RATE PAYER.

03:16:28.143 --> 03:16:29.677
TO PAY FOR THESE THINGS.

03:16:29.744 --> 03:16:31.813
SO.

03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:35.216
CAP AND TRADE IN SOME NATION.

03:16:35.283 --> 03:16:37.418
IS MONEY. WAS LIKE A BOMB IS

03:16:37.485 --> 03:16:38.620
GOING TO BE HERE WHO HAS A SHE

03:16:38.686 --> 03:16:40.221
HAS A WINDOW.

03:16:40.288 --> 03:16:41.389
IN THE BE BEST TO INVEST IN

03:16:41.456 --> 03:16:42.590
SOMETHING THAT OUT LIVES THAT

03:16:42.657 --> 03:16:44.392
WINDOW.

03:16:44.459 --> 03:16:45.894
THEN TAKING IT IN INVESTED IN

03:16:45.960 --> 03:16:47.996
SOMEBODY'S LOKAR.

03:16:48.062 --> 03:16:49.964
PROBABLY BY THEMSELVES.

03:16:50.031 --> 03:16:51.299
BECAUSE OUR NUMBERS SHOWN ONLY

03:16:51.366 --> 03:16:52.567
PEOPLE RIGHT THESE HAVE PRETTY

03:16:52.634 --> 03:16:54.369
GOOD INCOME ANYWAY.

03:16:54.435 --> 03:16:56.004
IT. DOES HAVE A VERY SPECIALIZED

03:16:56.070 --> 03:16:56.738
SITE.

03:16:56.804 --> 03:16:58.940
SO I THINK.

03:16:59.007 --> 03:17:00.842
I'M ALL FOR.

03:17:00.909 --> 03:17:03.311
ELECTRICAL CARS NEW ENERGY NEW

03:17:03.378 --> 03:17:04.946
TRANSPORTATION ALL FOUR BUT I

03:17:05.013 --> 03:17:06.915
THINK WE HAVE A VERY FINITE

03:17:06.981 --> 03:17:08.683
AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SHOULD USE IT.

03:17:08.750 --> 03:17:10.084
IN THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WAY WE

03:17:10.151 --> 03:17:11.886
CAN AND I WOULD SAY BE BETTER TO

03:17:11.953 --> 03:17:13.821
BE AN INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT AND

03:17:13.888 --> 03:17:16.357
SOMEBODY'S LITTLE CAR.

03:17:16.424 --> 03:17:17.926
IF I CAN MR CHEN I'D LIKE TO

03:17:17.992 --> 03:17:19.227
RESPOND TO A COUPLE COMMENTS ON

03:17:19.294 --> 03:17:20.595
THE TRAIN AND PACKAGE THERE'S A

03:17:20.662 --> 03:17:24.465
LOT THERE ON-AGAIN.

03:17:24.532 --> 03:17:25.400
THE FUNDING SOURCES ARE

03:17:25.466 --> 03:17:26.601
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT SO YOU

03:17:26.668 --> 03:17:28.636
REFERENCE BOND FUNDS ON THE K.

03:17:28.703 --> 03:17:30.505
TWELVE SIDE AND I THINK PART OF

03:17:30.572 --> 03:17:32.407
THE POLICY ARGUMENT THERE IS IF

03:17:32.473 --> 03:17:33.675
YOU BUY.

03:17:33.741 --> 03:17:36.077
IF YOU BUY WITH BOND FUNDS.

03:17:36.144 --> 03:17:37.745
A PRODUCTS.

03:17:37.812 --> 03:17:39.147
YOUR PAIN DEBT SERVICE ON THAT

03:17:39.214 --> 03:17:41.216
FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS.

03:17:41.282 --> 03:17:42.283
THE FUNDS THAT WE'RE TALKING

03:17:42.350 --> 03:17:44.118
ABOUT HERE THERE IS NOT A DEBT

03:17:44.185 --> 03:17:45.653
SERVICE COMPONENT LA THAT

03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:47.188
DOESN'T SAY YOU KNOW THAT WE

03:17:47.255 --> 03:17:48.623
SHOULDN'T WANT THEM TO BE

03:17:48.690 --> 03:17:50.058
INVESTMENT THAT WILL HAVE A

03:17:50.124 --> 03:17:51.859
DURABLE LIFECYCLE. ON BUT IT'S

03:17:51.926 --> 03:17:53.127
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT I THINK THE

03:17:53.194 --> 03:17:54.629
ARGUMENT ON BOND FUNDS IS THAT

03:17:54.696 --> 03:17:56.397
THE STATE IS PAYING THE DEBT

03:17:56.464 --> 03:17:57.332
SERVICE FOR THIRTY YEARS IF IT

03:17:57.398 --> 03:17:58.533
ONLY LASTS FIVE YEARS WERE STILL

03:17:58.600 --> 03:17:59.834
PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S NO

03:17:59.901 --> 03:18:01.603
LONGER IN USE.

03:18:01.669 --> 03:18:02.337
AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE A

03:18:02.403 --> 03:18:04.305
DISTINCTION BETWEEN BOND FUNDS

03:18:04.372 --> 03:18:06.441
AND GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS BECAUSE

03:18:06.507 --> 03:18:07.575
THEY'RE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

03:18:07.642 --> 03:18:08.776
FROM THE STATE'S FINANCIAL.

03:18:08.843 --> 03:18:10.078
VIEWPOINT BUT THEY'RE NOT

03:18:10.144 --> 03:18:11.379
DIFFERENT FROM THE INDUSTRY'S AT

03:18:11.446 --> 03:18:12.680
A PAIN FOR THAT IF YOU LOOK AT

03:18:12.747 --> 03:18:14.115
THE MANUFACTURERS OR THE

03:18:14.182 --> 03:18:15.216
AGRICULTURE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

03:18:15.283 --> 03:18:16.918
BUYING. THESE TRACTORS AND

03:18:16.985 --> 03:18:18.820
THINGS TO BE.

03:18:18.886 --> 03:18:19.654
WHAT'S WHY THEY WERE THE WHOLE

03:18:19.721 --> 03:18:22.090
CABIN TRAIT THING WAS GOING INTO

03:18:22.156 --> 03:18:23.791
WAS AFFECTED MANUFACTURES AND

03:18:23.858 --> 03:18:24.926
AGRICULTURE'S OR MAKING LONG

03:18:24.993 --> 03:18:26.461
TERM INVESTMENTS.

03:18:26.527 --> 03:18:28.162
AND DAVID RETOOLING THEIR EFFORT

03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:29.464
AND THEY HAD TO GO OUT AND TAKE

03:18:29.530 --> 03:18:30.932
LONG TO DO THIS STUFF.

03:18:30.999 --> 03:18:32.700
SO I'M JUST SAYING.

03:18:32.767 --> 03:18:34.369
THERE'S A TALE OF THAT THING AND

03:18:34.435 --> 03:18:35.336
I THINK WE SHOULD USE THE MONEY.

03:18:35.403 --> 03:18:37.505
AND THEY.

03:18:37.572 --> 03:18:38.273
AND A LARGER PERSPECTIVE THEN

03:18:38.339 --> 03:18:40.508
REBATES.

03:18:40.575 --> 03:18:43.378
WOULD YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT.

03:18:43.444 --> 03:18:44.345
THEN THE ONE.

03:18:44.412 --> 03:18:46.547
EDITION AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE IN

03:18:46.614 --> 03:18:48.049
TERMS OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN

03:18:48.116 --> 03:18:49.784
CAP TRADE AS WELL AS GENERAL

03:18:49.851 --> 03:18:50.852
OBLIGATION BONDS IN TERMS OF

03:18:50.918 --> 03:18:52.287
DEBT SERVICES.

03:18:52.353 --> 03:18:55.456
THE POINT OF THE REBATES IS ALSO

03:18:55.523 --> 03:18:56.691
TO ACCELERATE THE.

03:18:56.758 --> 03:18:59.327
TO SERVE MARKET IN SO THE WHOLE

03:18:59.394 --> 03:19:01.029
POINT OF THIS IS WHAT WE ARE

03:19:01.095 --> 03:19:02.697
LOOKING LONG TERM. ABOUT THE

03:19:02.764 --> 03:19:04.098
STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND TWENTY

03:19:04.165 --> 03:19:05.333
FIFTY.

03:19:05.400 --> 03:19:06.200
IN ORDER TO GET TO OUR TWENTY

03:19:06.267 --> 03:19:07.635
FIFTY GOALS.

03:19:07.702 --> 03:19:10.605
WE NEED TO CHANGE THE.

03:19:10.672 --> 03:19:14.475
MAKEUP OF THE STATE A VEHICLE

03:19:14.542 --> 03:19:16.377
V. VEHICLES ARE BEING DRIVEN IN

03:19:16.444 --> 03:19:19.113
ORDER TO GET THERE WE NEED.

03:19:19.580 --> 03:19:22.583
TRANSFORMATION IN TERMS OF THE

03:19:22.650 --> 03:19:23.918
OF VEHICLES THAT ARE PURCHASED

03:19:23.985 --> 03:19:25.320
SO THE MORE THAT YOU CAN

03:19:25.386 --> 03:19:27.789
ACCELERATE THE PURCHASE OF ZERO

03:19:27.855 --> 03:19:29.223
EMISSION VEHICLES COMBINED WITH

03:19:29.290 --> 03:19:30.958
INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:19:31.025 --> 03:19:31.793
THEN.

03:19:31.859 --> 03:19:33.995
YOU DRIVE THE.

03:19:34.062 --> 03:19:35.897
IT BECOMES ARM A SELF

03:19:35.963 --> 03:19:37.198
SUSTAINING MARKET WHERE.

03:19:37.265 --> 03:19:39.701
IN A CERTAIN POINT OH ZERO

03:19:39.767 --> 03:19:42.370
EMISSION VEHICLES THE PRICE OF A

03:19:42.437 --> 03:19:43.838
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE

03:19:43.905 --> 03:19:45.440
COMPARABLE TO OF FOSSIL FUEL

03:19:45.506 --> 03:19:46.674
GENERATED.

03:19:46.741 --> 03:19:49.410
VEHICLES AND THEN WITHOUT ANY

03:19:49.477 --> 03:19:51.646
REBATES WITHOUT ANY SUBSIDIES

03:19:51.713 --> 03:19:53.147
ARE CONSUMERS WOULD BE WILLING

03:19:53.214 --> 03:19:54.482
TO PURCHASE THE ZERO EMISSION

03:19:54.549 --> 03:19:57.585
VEHICLES ON THE ROUND. AND IT

03:19:57.652 --> 03:19:59.520
THEN ACCELERATES.

03:19:59.587 --> 03:20:02.323
THROUGH A A NORMAL FUNCTIONING

03:20:02.390 --> 03:20:03.324
MARKET.

03:20:03.391 --> 03:20:05.593
THE CONSUMER'S WILLINGNESS TO

03:20:05.660 --> 03:20:06.861
PURCHASE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

03:20:06.928 --> 03:20:09.097
SO WHAT THIS DOES AGAIN IF THE

03:20:09.163 --> 03:20:10.565
REBATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE

03:20:10.631 --> 03:20:12.066
COMBINED IS EXCELLING IN THE

03:20:12.133 --> 03:20:13.334
MARKET.

03:20:13.401 --> 03:20:15.069
BUT I'D ALSO SAY THAT ARGUMENT

03:20:15.136 --> 03:20:17.004
WAS USED WITH SOLAR PANELS.

03:20:17.071 --> 03:20:17.839
AND.

03:20:17.905 --> 03:20:19.374
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE

03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:20.942
STARTED SOLAR PANELS WE

03:20:21.008 --> 03:20:22.443
SUBSIDIZE THAT SO THE SOLAR

03:20:22.510 --> 03:20:24.011
PANELS GO DOWN TO THE PEOPLE GO

03:20:24.078 --> 03:20:25.580
USE THEM.

03:20:25.646 --> 03:20:28.149
AND NOW'S A SOLAR PANELS HAVE

03:20:28.216 --> 03:20:30.218
GONE DOWN AS A MORE EFFICIENT.

03:20:30.284 --> 03:20:31.919
AND A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE.

03:20:31.986 --> 03:20:34.088
BUT DISTILLATE DRIVE RIGHT NOW

03:20:34.155 --> 03:20:36.524
TO CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE PANELS

03:20:36.591 --> 03:20:37.358
AYE THEY COME TO MY OFFICE ALL

03:20:37.425 --> 03:20:40.027
TIMES AND WE NEED TO EVERY BATES

03:20:40.094 --> 03:20:41.562
AND SOLAR PANELS. AWAY.

03:20:41.629 --> 03:20:43.364
BUT WHAT TIME DOES AN INDUSTRY

03:20:43.431 --> 03:20:44.699
SAY I NO LONGER NEED TO BE

03:20:44.766 --> 03:20:45.967
SUBSIDIZED BY GOVERNMENT TO BE

03:20:46.033 --> 03:20:48.503
COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET.

03:20:48.569 --> 03:20:50.271
AND I THINK THAT'S THE SAME.

03:20:50.338 --> 03:20:51.973
WITH VEHICLES BECAUSE AT ONE

03:20:52.039 --> 03:20:52.807
TIME PEOPLE RUN AROUND WITH

03:20:52.874 --> 03:20:54.375
HORSES

03:20:54.442 --> 03:20:55.343
AND THEY THOUGHT YOU KNOW WOULD

03:20:55.410 --> 03:20:57.145
BE MORE PHYSICALLY GO TO CARS.

03:20:57.211 --> 03:20:59.113
SO I THINK WHEN YOU DO A CHANGE

03:20:59.180 --> 03:21:00.548
WITHIN SOCIETY LIKE

03:21:00.615 --> 03:21:01.983
TRANSPORTATION OR DOCUMENT OR

03:21:02.049 --> 03:21:04.051
ENERGY ON THE TOP I DON'T MIND.

03:21:04.118 --> 03:21:06.421
.

03:21:06.487 --> 03:21:09.257
INFUSING NEW TECHNOLOGY.

03:21:09.323 --> 03:21:10.691
BUT AT SOME POINT YOU NEED TO

03:21:10.758 --> 03:21:12.093
WEAN THEM OFF AND THEY NEED TO

03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:14.262
BE COMPETITIVE MAKE IT FAIR. AND

03:21:14.328 --> 03:21:15.830
AND RUN THE SYSTEM THAT WAY AND

03:21:15.897 --> 03:21:17.098
THAT BUT THAT'S AN ARGUMENT.

03:21:17.165 --> 03:21:18.433
DO YOU BELIEVE THE COMPETITIVE

03:21:18.499 --> 03:21:20.168
MARKET BEST DRIVER YOU THINK

03:21:20.234 --> 03:21:20.935
GOVERNMENT'S BEST DRIVE AND

03:21:21.002 --> 03:21:22.370
THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE YOU AND I

03:21:22.437 --> 03:21:23.671
HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE

03:21:23.738 --> 03:21:25.039
YOU KNOW MY TAKE A CRACK AT THIS

03:21:25.106 --> 03:21:27.108
SO ON IN TERMS OF SOLAR PANELS

03:21:27.175 --> 03:21:29.277
THERE THEN MAYBE THERE'S. A

03:21:29.343 --> 03:21:31.612
MISPERCEPTION THERE ARE. THERE

03:21:31.679 --> 03:21:32.780
ARE NO MORE ADVOCATES

03:21:32.847 --> 03:21:35.750
TO ADVOCATE FOR INCENTIVES FOR.

03:21:35.817 --> 03:21:37.452
SOLAR PANELS ANYMORE BECAUSE

03:21:37.518 --> 03:21:39.187
WE'VE DONE THE JOB SOLAR

03:21:39.253 --> 03:21:40.188
ACTUALLY IS.

03:21:40.254 --> 03:21:42.557
VEER FAIRLY COST COMPETITIVE IN

03:21:42.623 --> 03:21:45.626
FAIRLY RECENT PRICE NOW. A DOE

03:21:45.693 --> 03:21:46.327
SAME.

03:21:46.394 --> 03:21:49.063
SOLAR FOLKS NOW HAVE GOT INTO

03:21:49.130 --> 03:21:49.797
THE.

03:21:49.864 --> 03:21:51.666
SOLAR.

03:21:51.732 --> 03:21:52.633
THE.

03:21:52.700 --> 03:21:56.070
THE STORE STICKING.

03:21:56.137 --> 03:21:56.637
AS I THOUGHT ABOUT IT THEIR

03:21:56.704 --> 03:21:57.472
DELIGHT BATTERY STORAGE THE

03:21:57.538 --> 03:21:58.673
STORAGE MARKET SO THAT COULD BE

03:21:58.739 --> 03:22:00.107
WHAT THEY'RE. TALKING TO BACK

03:22:00.174 --> 03:22:01.876
THAT'S AND THAT'S THE THIRD LEG

03:22:01.943 --> 03:22:03.411
OF THE WHEEL THAT IF WE HAVE

03:22:03.478 --> 03:22:04.946
RENEWABLE ENERGY. THE BEST WAY

03:22:05.012 --> 03:22:07.014
TO UTILIZED RENEWABLE ENERGY IN

03:22:07.081 --> 03:22:08.983
THE EVENING WHEN IT'S DARK IS TO

03:22:09.050 --> 03:22:09.884
STORE DURING THE DAY AND THEN

03:22:09.951 --> 03:22:11.786
THE USE IT IN THE EVENING. SO I

03:22:11.853 --> 03:22:12.820
I THINK YOUR POINT IS IT

03:22:12.887 --> 03:22:14.522
EXTRAORDINARILY WILL TAKE AND I

03:22:14.589 --> 03:22:15.857
THINK IT GOES BACK TO.

03:22:15.923 --> 03:22:17.725
MISTER OPENED HIS QUESTION

03:22:17.792 --> 03:22:20.094
ABOUT THE THE GOAL I THINK THAT

03:22:20.161 --> 03:22:22.730
THE SENSE OF IF WE COULD GET TO

03:22:22.797 --> 03:22:24.765
THAT FIVE MILLION GOAL BY TWENTY

03:22:24.832 --> 03:22:25.733
THIRTY.

03:22:25.800 --> 03:22:27.702
THE THE CENSUS PERHAPS WE

03:22:27.768 --> 03:22:29.203
WOULDN'T NEED ANY MORE AYE

03:22:29.270 --> 03:22:31.372
INCENTIVES OR WE COULD GREATLY

03:22:31.439 --> 03:22:33.074
RAMPANT DOWN BECAUSE AT THAT

03:22:33.140 --> 03:22:35.476
POINT. DAN DE AUTOMAKERS WOULD

03:22:35.543 --> 03:22:38.546
BE MAKING A VARIETY OF VEHICLES

03:22:38.613 --> 03:22:40.882
A VARIETY OF MARKETS ON WOULD BE

03:22:40.948 --> 03:22:42.083
WOULD BE NOW OPEN IF I CAN'T

03:22:42.149 --> 03:22:43.317
GENERAL MOTORS HAS TALKED ABOUT.

03:22:43.384 --> 03:22:44.719
TWO THIRDS OF THEIR VEHICLES

03:22:44.785 --> 03:22:47.688
WILL BE ELECTRIFIED BY TWENTY

03:22:47.755 --> 03:22:48.222
THIRTY SO THEY'RE READY.

03:22:48.289 --> 03:22:48.756
STARTING TO MOVE IN THAT

03:22:48.823 --> 03:22:50.391
DIRECTION CHINA IS FORCING ALL

03:22:50.458 --> 03:22:51.826
OF THE AUTOMAKERS TO MOVE IN

03:22:51.893 --> 03:22:52.693
THAT DIRECTION AS WELL SO I

03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:54.896
THINK. ON YOUR POINT

03:22:54.962 --> 03:22:55.530
EXTRAORDINAIRE WELL TAKEN WHICH

03:22:55.596 --> 03:22:57.131
IS WHY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

03:22:57.198 --> 03:22:58.833
START NOW BUT ALSO TRYING TO SET

03:22:58.900 --> 03:23:01.269
A GOAL WITH THE IDEA THAT AT

03:23:01.335 --> 03:23:02.303
SOME POINT IT DOES ACTUALLY

03:23:02.370 --> 03:23:03.571
GRANT AND I APPRECIATE BECAUSE

03:23:03.638 --> 03:23:04.639

PRIORITIZE THAT FUNDING IS IS

03:24:55.950 --> 03:24:57.251
MOSTLY LEFT WITH THE LOCAL

DISCUSSION OF THE LOCAL ENTITIES.

03:25:07.228 --> 03:25:08.663
BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING

03:25:08.729 --> 03:25:09.130
IS.

03:25:09.196 --> 03:25:11.098
DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY FOR

03:25:11.165 --> 03:25:13.668

TAKING MORE.

03:25:28.482 --> 03:25:30.484
HOUSING.

03:25:30.551 --> 03:25:32.253
ANOTHER A KEY AREA OF DIFFERENCE.

03:25:32.319 --> 03:25:34.455
IS.

03:25:34.522 --> 03:25:35.956
OF THE THE POPULATIONS THAT

03:25:48.803 --> 03:25:50.237
SOME FUNDING THAT WOULD GO FOR

03:25:50.304 --> 03:25:51.972
THE BROADER AYE LOW INCOME

03:25:52.039 --> 03:25:52.707
POPULATION ANOTHER KEY

03:25:52.773 --> 03:25:53.340
DIFFERENCE.

03:25:53.407 --> 03:25:55.276
IS THE THE DIFFERENT ACTIONS

ASSEMBLY DID NOT TAKING ACTION

03:26:06.587 --> 03:26:07.188
AND I THINK.

03:26:07.254 --> 03:26:09.690
WHATEVER IS DECIDED HERE WILL

03:26:09.757 --> 03:26:11.125
BE A KEY CONSIDERATION IN

LIKE HOME THAT COULD A MOVE SOME

03:26:23.270 --> 03:26:24.805
OF THE SOME. THAT WOULD UNLOCK A

03:26:24.872 --> 03:26:25.873
TWO BILLION DOLLARS ARE

03:26:25.940 --> 03:26:27.308
ACCELERATE THE EXPENDITURE OF

TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR PART OF

03:26:28.542 --> 03:26:29.944
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THAT COULD

03:26:30.010 --> 03:26:32.146
SHIFT SOME OF THE PRIORITY TO.

03:30:48.369 --> 03:30:49.770
SIGNIFICANT INJECTION OF FUNDS

03:30:49.837 --> 03:30:52.473
INTO THE EMERGENCY.

03:30:52.539 --> 03:30:54.441
ADDRESSING THE NEED OF THE

03:30:54.508 --> 03:30:55.075
PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON THE STREET

03:30:55.142 --> 03:30:55.943
RIGHT NOW.

03:30:56.010 --> 03:30:58.045
.

03:30:58.112 --> 03:30:59.913
AND OF COURSE I THINK THE THE

03:30:59.980 --> 03:31:03.050
SENATE'S CONSTRUCTION WAS NOT TO

03:31:03.117 --> 03:31:04.685
IGNORE THAT THAT'S REAL BUT

03:31:04.752 --> 03:31:08.789
RATHER. TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

03:31:08.856 --> 03:31:10.357
YES YOU CAN PUT FUNDS TOWARDS

03:31:10.424 --> 03:31:13.027
EMERGENCY WITCHES NOBODY WOULD.

03:31:13.093 --> 03:31:14.628
QUESTION THAT WE ARE IN A.

03:31:14.695 --> 03:31:16.363
TOTAL EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW IF YOU

03:31:16.430 --> 03:31:18.499
JUST WALK DOWN. IT ANY OF IT IN

03:31:18.565 --> 03:31:19.800
ANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THE

03:31:19.867 --> 03:31:21.435
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE LIVING ON

03:31:21.502 --> 03:31:23.437
SIDEWALKS OR INTENT ENCAMPMENTS.

03:31:23.504 --> 03:31:26.707
BUT THE CONCERN IS OF COURSE.

03:31:26.774 --> 03:31:30.277
IF WE. AGAIN HOW YOU STRUCTURE

03:31:30.344 --> 03:31:32.079
HOW MUCH MONEY PUT TOWARDS.

03:31:32.146 --> 03:31:35.149
A SHORT TERM SOLUTION KNOWING

03:31:35.215 --> 03:31:38.052
THAT YOU THEN MAY NOT WANT YOUR.

03:31:38.118 --> 03:31:39.653
SHORT TERM SOLUTION FUNDING IS

03:31:39.720 --> 03:31:41.989
GONE. THEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE

03:31:42.056 --> 03:31:43.857
PERMANENT HOUSING FOR THE FOLKS

03:31:43.924 --> 03:31:46.193
DO THEY GO BACK ON THE STREET.

03:31:46.260 --> 03:31:48.829
THEY'VE GIVEN. GIVEN THAT.

03:31:48.896 --> 03:31:50.631
SOME OF THE MONEY THAT'S GOING

03:31:50.697 --> 03:31:52.132
TO COME AVAILABLE.

03:31:52.199 --> 03:31:54.068
IS GOING TO BE PRETTY MUCH

03:31:54.134 --> 03:31:55.002
TOTALLY FOR THE PERMANENT

03:31:55.069 --> 03:31:57.438
AFFORDABLE.

03:31:57.504 --> 03:32:00.207
.

03:32:00.274 --> 03:32:00.541
THERE MAY BE.

03:32:00.607 --> 03:32:02.643
.

03:32:02.709 --> 03:32:03.744
THERE MAY BE AN ARGUMENT FOR

03:32:03.811 --> 03:32:06.180
STRUCTURING AT LEAST OUR FIRST.

03:32:06.246 --> 03:32:07.414
INJECTION OF FUNDS A LITTLE

03:32:07.481 --> 03:32:08.982
HIGHER TOWARDS

03:32:09.049 --> 03:32:10.117
THE EMERGENCY NEED.

03:32:10.184 --> 03:32:12.820
.

03:32:12.886 --> 03:32:15.222
AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S.

03:32:15.289 --> 03:32:17.291
YOUR THE AMOUNT YOU PUT TOWARDS

03:32:17.357 --> 03:32:18.926
AN EMERGENCY NEED.

03:32:18.992 --> 03:32:20.661
NOT COUNTING TO NO PLACE LIKE

03:32:20.727 --> 03:32:22.563
HOME BUT WHAT DOLLAR AMOUNT WAS

03:32:22.629 --> 03:32:23.964
THAT. WE PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED

03:32:24.031 --> 03:32:25.699
AND FIFTY MILLION FOR EMERGENCY

03:32:25.766 --> 03:32:28.135
HOMELESS EIGHT GRANTS.

03:32:28.202 --> 03:32:30.904
TO LEARN FIFTY FOR.

03:32:30.971 --> 03:32:32.406
AND THAT'S AT A GENERAL FUND AND

03:32:32.473 --> 03:32:33.807
THEN THERE WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED

03:32:33.874 --> 03:32:36.243
FIFTY NO EXCUSE ME HUNDRED AND

03:32:36.310 --> 03:32:53.560
TWENTY FIVE FROM SP TO

03:32:54.761 --> 03:32:54.828
.

03:32:54.828 --> 03:32:57.097
THAT AND I THINK MINE WAS AS

03:32:57.164 --> 03:33:01.568
MUCH COMMONERS QUESTION BUT. I'M.

03:33:01.635 --> 03:33:05.405
I SURRENDER THE FOR RESTRICTING.

03:33:05.472 --> 03:33:07.007
I JUST GOT UP I GUESS FOR.

03:33:07.074 --> 03:33:10.244
ON THE WAY THAT WE CONSTRUCTED.

03:33:10.310 --> 03:33:12.312
I'M OUR ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL IS WE

03:33:12.379 --> 03:33:13.981
DIDN'T LOOK AT.

03:33:14.047 --> 03:33:17.284
HOW THE DIVINE THOUGH ONE? POINT

03:33:17.351 --> 03:33:19.119
FIVE BILLION BY ITSELF BUT I

03:33:19.186 --> 03:33:20.354
THINK WHAT WE DID WAS TRY TO

03:33:20.420 --> 03:33:21.955
LOOK AT.

03:33:22.022 --> 03:33:25.159
THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

03:33:25.225 --> 03:33:27.394
HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR

03:33:27.461 --> 03:33:29.463
PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

03:33:29.530 --> 03:33:31.665
WHETHER IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

03:33:31.732 --> 03:33:33.100
ASIDE MISS COSTA MATCH INTO THE

03:33:33.167 --> 03:33:34.535
HOUSING BOND THAT ON THE BALLOT

03:33:34.601 --> 03:33:36.737
IN NOVEMBER. S. B. TO THE PRO

03:33:36.803 --> 03:33:39.373
TEM'S BILL THAT PASSED ON AND

03:33:39.439 --> 03:33:41.508
OUT OBVIOUSLY THE LARGE MAJORITY

03:33:41.575 --> 03:33:42.943
OF THAT MONEY WAS FOR PERMANENT

03:33:43.010 --> 03:33:44.678
AFFORDABLE. HOUSING SO WE

03:33:44.745 --> 03:33:45.546
THOUGHT.

03:33:45.612 --> 03:33:48.182
THIS IS WHAT WE CONSTRUCTED

03:33:48.248 --> 03:33:50.517
BASED ON THE OVERALL PICTURE NOT

03:33:50.584 --> 03:33:51.218
JUST THE.

03:33:51.285 --> 03:33:52.953
PICTURE FOR THIS YEAR OR THIS

03:33:53.020 --> 03:33:54.188
FINITE AMOUNT OF MONEY I THINK I

03:33:54.254 --> 03:33:55.989
WAS THAT I THINK THAT.

03:33:56.056 --> 03:33:56.990
VANTAGE POINT THAT WE WE TOOK A

03:33:57.057 --> 03:33:59.526
SHOT AT.

03:33:59.593 --> 03:34:00.594
SENATE MORE LOCKED AWAY I

03:34:00.661 --> 03:34:01.862
THOUGHT BEFORE I FORGET ONE ONE

03:34:01.929 --> 03:34:03.096
QUICK QUESTION CONTRIBUTED TO

03:34:03.163 --> 03:34:05.265

EMERGENCY EIGHT BLOCK GRANTS.

03:34:06.833 --> 03:34:08.101
WELL I KNOW THAT IT WAS

03:34:08.168 --> 03:34:08.635
APPROPRIATE TOWARD LOCAL

PROPORTION TO HOW THEY WANT THAT.

03:34:17.077 --> 03:34:18.212

BE A CITY OR A COUNTY THERE

03:37:40.680 --> 03:37:41.648
REGIONALLY BASED.

03:37:41.715 --> 03:37:45.852
ON AND IT'S BASED AND ON THE

03:37:45.919 --> 03:37:47.254
THAT CAN TEAMS OF CARE HOW I'VE

03:37:47.320 --> 03:37:48.088
KIND OF BROADER.

03:37:48.155 --> 03:37:49.356
WHAT THEY CALL POINT IN TIME

03:37:49.423 --> 03:37:50.624
COUNTS FOR EACH OF THE CITIES

03:37:50.690 --> 03:37:51.825
AND COUNTIES THAT ARE WITHIN

03:37:51.892 --> 03:37:53.026
THAT REGION?

03:37:53.093 --> 03:37:53.460
AND SET OUT FOR THE

03:37:53.527 --> 03:37:54.861
ADMINISTRATIVE.

03:37:54.928 --> 03:37:56.396
STRUCTURE WE'VE CHOSEN.

03:37:56.463 --> 03:37:58.865
ALONG WITH REQUIRING.

03:37:58.932 --> 03:38:01.701
TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS ON THAT

03:38:01.768 --> 03:38:03.937
THE LOCALITY HAS DECLARED A

03:38:04.004 --> 03:38:06.039
SHELTER EMERGENCY. A WHICH IS

03:38:06.106 --> 03:38:06.907
THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THAT

03:38:06.973 --> 03:38:08.909
ALLOWS ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION

03:38:08.975 --> 03:38:10.944
AND TO DECLARE SHELTER EMERGENCY

03:38:11.011 --> 03:38:12.078
AND ALLOW.

03:38:12.145 --> 03:38:13.346
FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF SOME

03:38:13.413 --> 03:38:16.049
LIABILITY ISSUES CANDIDLY THAT

03:38:16.116 --> 03:38:16.616
ARE INVOLVED WITH TEMPORARY

03:38:16.683 --> 03:38:17.884
HOUSING.

03:38:17.951 --> 03:38:19.019
ON THESE PROBABLY SEEN SOME

03:38:19.085 --> 03:38:20.454
LOCALITIES IF USED TOUGH SHOTS

03:38:20.520 --> 03:38:22.155
AND OTHER THINGS AND THEY HAVE

03:38:22.222 --> 03:38:23.757
UTILIZED BY GOVERNMENT CODE

03:38:23.824 --> 03:38:25.592
SECTION FOR THAT PURPOSE.

03:38:25.659 --> 03:38:26.726
ALMONDS OF THE GRANT WOULD ALLOW

03:38:26.793 --> 03:38:28.261
FOR THAT AS WELL.

03:38:28.328 --> 03:38:29.596
SO THEORETICALLY IF NOT

03:38:29.663 --> 03:38:30.697
PRACTICALLY THE MONIES CAN FLOW

03:38:30.764 --> 03:38:32.265
TO THE.

03:38:32.332 --> 03:38:33.900
THE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED I

03:38:33.967 --> 03:38:36.203
WOULD ASSUME.

03:38:36.269 --> 03:38:38.138
BASED ON. THERE ARE DIFFERENT

03:38:38.205 --> 03:38:39.439
WAYS TO GET OUT THAT I THINK

03:38:39.506 --> 03:38:41.374
THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES

03:38:41.441 --> 03:38:42.742
ABOUT HOW WE WOULD DO THAT.

03:38:42.809 --> 03:38:44.110
ONE.

03:38:44.177 --> 03:38:46.279
MEASURE COULD BE THE POINT IN

03:38:46.346 --> 03:38:47.380
TIME COUNT

03:38:47.447 --> 03:38:49.616
ON WHICH IS A FEDERALLY REQUIRED

03:38:49.683 --> 03:38:50.050
WHERE.

03:38:50.116 --> 03:38:51.985
LOCALITIES ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY

03:38:52.052 --> 03:38:53.420
GO OUT AND COUNT THE NUMBER OF

03:38:53.487 --> 03:38:55.021
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR

03:38:55.088 --> 03:38:56.957
LOCALITY. I'M OBVIOUSLY THAT

03:38:57.023 --> 03:38:59.125
METHODOLOGY IS SUBJECT TO ERRORS

03:38:59.192 --> 03:39:01.061
IT'S NOT A PERFECT METHODOLOGY.

03:39:01.127 --> 03:39:03.663
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I

03:39:03.730 --> 03:39:04.965
WOULD NOTE WHEN WE WERE PUTTING

03:39:05.031 --> 03:39:07.467
FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS.

03:39:07.534 --> 03:39:09.169
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOMELESSNESS

03:39:09.236 --> 03:39:10.437
IN CALIFORNIA'S AROUND THE SAME

03:39:10.504 --> 03:39:13.006
AS IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN.

03:39:13.073 --> 03:39:14.341
THE BIG STORY HERE IS THE

03:39:14.407 --> 03:39:15.775
DIFFERENCE IN SHELTERED VERSES

03:39:15.842 --> 03:39:17.978
ON SHELTERED AND WE ARE SEEN BIG

03:39:18.044 --> 03:39:19.880
DIFFERENCES AND THE NUMBER OF

03:39:19.946 --> 03:39:21.081
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE I'M

03:39:21.147 --> 03:39:22.549
SHELTERED.

03:39:22.616 --> 03:39:24.951
AND UTILIZING THAT DATA WE PUT

03:39:25.018 --> 03:39:26.786
FORWARD A PROPOSAL REALLY AIMED

03:39:26.853 --> 03:39:28.922
AT THAT ISSUE.

03:39:28.989 --> 03:39:31.358
AND AND SO WE HAVE A MORE

03:39:31.424 --> 03:39:32.359
BLENDED APPROACH IN WHICH WE

03:39:32.425 --> 03:39:34.027
DON'T ON JUST USE THE POINT AND

03:39:34.094 --> 03:39:35.595
TIME COUNTS.

03:39:35.662 --> 03:39:38.064
BECAUSE IT'S.

03:39:38.131 --> 03:39:38.932
IF THE MEASURE.

03:39:38.999 --> 03:39:41.535
BUT IT'S IT'S IN PERFECT IN HOW

03:39:41.601 --> 03:39:42.669
IT'S EXECUTED.

03:39:42.736 --> 03:39:44.604
<u>&lt;c.green&gt; AND THIS IS DIFFICULT I&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:39:44.671 --> 03:39:45.805
DON'T KNOW THAT I KNOW A BETTER

03:39:45.872 --> 03:39:47.073
MEASURE FOR DETERMINING THE

03:39:47.140 --> 03:39:48.608
NUMBER OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS

03:39:48.675 --> 03:39:49.242
BUT.

03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:50.610
ONE WE HAVE DEVELOPED OUR

03:39:50.677 --> 03:39:51.912
METHODOLOGY WE DID SEE SOME

03:39:51.978 --> 03:39:53.613
DIFFERENCES IN USING ONLY POINT

03:39:53.680 --> 03:39:55.715
IN TIME. AS DETERMINING THE

03:39:55.782 --> 03:39:57.217
DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND I THINK AS I

03:39:57.284 --> 03:39:58.251
RECALL FROM THE BUDGET

03:39:58.318 --> 03:39:59.786
SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS ONE OF THE

03:39:59.853 --> 03:40:00.954
POINTS.

03:40:01.021 --> 03:40:03.023
THAT WAS MADE DURING THAT

03:40:03.089 --> 03:40:06.026
PROCESS IS THE POINT TIME COUNT.

03:40:06.092 --> 03:40:08.428
PERHAPS DISADVANTAGES OF WHO

03:40:08.495 --> 03:40:11.264
LOCALES JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE.

03:40:11.331 --> 03:40:12.966
DONE A BIT MORE TO ADDRESS THE

03:40:13.033 --> 03:40:15.735
HOMELESS ISSUE IN THE PAST.

03:40:15.802 --> 03:40:18.071
POINT TIME COUNCIL OF LOWER AND

03:40:18.138 --> 03:40:19.639
THEIR THEN DISADVANTAGED WHEN IT

03:40:19.706 --> 03:40:21.374
COMES TIME TO THE DISTRIBUTION

03:40:21.441 --> 03:40:22.676
FOR THE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF

03:40:22.742 --> 03:40:24.077
FUNDS AND SO I'M.

03:40:24.144 --> 03:40:26.947
I'M. HOPEFUL THAT SURE BLENDED

03:40:27.013 --> 03:40:28.982
METHODOLOGY WILL WILL ADDRESS

03:40:29.049 --> 03:40:30.984
SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS SO AS WE

03:40:31.051 --> 03:40:32.485
MOVE THIS THING FORWARD. OR

03:40:32.552 --> 03:40:33.920
ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT THANK YOU

03:40:33.987 --> 03:40:35.689
HEATHER NOTE I WOULD HAVE ON

03:40:35.755 --> 03:40:37.557
POINT IN TIME CAL IS. THEN YOU

03:40:37.624 --> 03:40:38.959
START GETTING INTO ISSUES IN THE

03:40:39.025 --> 03:40:40.360
POLITIES WHERE MAYBE THEY HAVE A

03:40:40.427 --> 03:40:42.262
APPROVED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND

03:40:42.329 --> 03:40:43.630
SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT WITH THE

03:40:43.697 --> 03:40:44.531
BLENDED APPROACH SO THAT WE

03:40:44.598 --> 03:40:46.766
COULD HAVE A MORE NUANCED VIEW

03:40:46.833 --> 03:40:48.935
OF WHERE THE NEED WAS.

03:40:49.002 --> 03:40:49.869
AND AND FINALLY IF I CAN ASK ONE

03:40:49.936 --> 03:40:51.304
MORE ME WHAT WHAT ONE OF THE

03:40:51.371 --> 03:40:52.906
CONCERNS THAT I IF I UNDERSTAND

03:40:52.973 --> 03:40:54.274
THE.

03:40:54.341 --> 03:40:55.909
THE BIG CITY MAYORS CORRECTLY IS

03:40:55.976 --> 03:40:57.010
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT NOT

03:40:57.077 --> 03:40:58.778
GETTING APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION

03:40:58.845 --> 03:41:00.880
OF FUNDS FROM COUNTIES IS THAT

03:41:00.947 --> 03:41:03.717
IS THAT THE ISSUE.

03:41:03.783 --> 03:41:07.387
ANYBODY CAN ANYONE ADDRESS THAT.

03:41:07.454 --> 03:41:10.357
I'D SAY THAT THERE IS.

03:41:10.423 --> 03:41:12.359
TOM TOOK SOME OF THAT CONCERN OR

03:41:12.425 --> 03:41:13.093
THAT THEIR.

03:41:13.159 --> 03:41:16.162
THEIR FEELING GUIDE AND

03:41:16.229 --> 03:41:17.397
OBVIOUSLY IT DEPENDS ON THIS

03:41:17.464 --> 03:41:19.733
CITY AND THE COUNTY RELATIONSHIP

03:41:19.799 --> 03:41:21.468
BY THINK THERE IS SOME FEELING

03:41:21.534 --> 03:41:22.902
IN SOME CITIES THAT THEIR LAST

03:41:22.969 --> 03:41:24.304
SHOULDERING THE BURDEN. HAVING

03:41:24.371 --> 03:41:26.172
THE PUBLIC WORKS DOLLARS HAVING

03:41:26.239 --> 03:41:28.041
THE PUBLIC SAFETY DOLLARS AND

03:41:28.108 --> 03:41:30.944
NOT GETTING THE SUPPORT THAT

03:41:31.011 --> 03:41:32.178
THEY NEED FROM THAT THE COUNTIES.

03:41:32.245 --> 03:41:33.346
SO THESE PROPOSALS THAT ARE ON

03:41:33.413 --> 03:41:34.314
THE TABLE ONE OR MORE OF THEM

03:41:34.381 --> 03:41:36.650
WILL ADDRESS.

03:41:36.716 --> 03:41:37.951
THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE MISTER

03:41:38.018 --> 03:41:39.019
CHAIR I THINK THAT THAT IS THE

03:41:39.085 --> 03:41:41.154
HOPE.

03:41:41.221 --> 03:41:41.788
THAT IS THE WHOLE DOT NET THAT'S

03:41:41.855 --> 03:41:42.956
WHY I THINK.

03:41:43.023 --> 03:41:45.091
IT'S ON THE MAYOR'S AGAIN IS NOT

03:41:45.158 --> 03:41:46.926
JUST A LARK ALLOCATION EPIC JUST

03:41:46.993 --> 03:41:48.294
A LARGE CITY MAYORS BE TO ANY

03:41:48.361 --> 03:41:50.296
CITY. AND I REALLY WOULD GIVE

03:41:50.363 --> 03:41:51.164
CITIES.

03:41:51.231 --> 03:41:52.265
A LITTLE MORE DIRECT

03:41:52.332 --> 03:41:54.034
APPROPRIATION WHICH I THINK THEY

03:41:54.100 --> 03:41:55.068
FEEL LIKE THEY NEED A LITTLE

03:41:55.135 --> 03:41:56.469
MORE. ASSISTANCE WITH THEM AND I

03:41:56.536 --> 03:41:57.771
ACTUALLY WAS THE POINT OF MY

03:41:57.837 --> 03:42:00.140
FIRST QUESTION WAS TO MAKE TO TO

03:42:00.206 --> 03:42:00.840
TRY TO FIGURE OUT.

03:42:00.907 --> 03:42:02.475
WHETHER A CITY FOR EXAMPLE WOULD

03:42:02.542 --> 03:42:04.310
HAVE AN EQUAL SEAT AT THE TABLE

03:42:04.377 --> 03:42:06.279
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET MONEY.

03:42:06.346 --> 03:42:07.681
AT THE SAME TIME TO COUNTIES

03:42:07.747 --> 03:42:10.083
UPON WHAT I THINK THAT IS WHAT.

03:42:10.150 --> 03:42:12.886
MISS COSTA WAS POLITELY.

03:42:12.952 --> 03:42:14.954
TALKING ABOUT THAT THAT POINT

03:42:15.021 --> 03:42:16.990
HAS NOT BEEN SETTLED YET I THINK

03:42:17.057 --> 03:42:19.292
IT'S PART OF OUR DISCUSSION.

03:42:19.359 --> 03:42:19.993
DISCUSS IS A LITTLE LATE I WOULD

03:42:20.060 --> 03:42:21.428
JUST SAVING THE STATE HAS A

03:42:21.494 --> 03:42:23.063
VESTED INTERESTS ENSURING THAT

03:42:23.129 --> 03:42:24.597
CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE WORKING

03:42:24.664 --> 03:42:26.533
TOGETHER TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS.

03:42:26.599 --> 03:42:28.068
AT YOU KNOW CAPITAL PROJECTS

03:42:28.134 --> 03:42:30.303
ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS EASY THOSE

03:42:30.370 --> 03:42:31.571
DOLLARS ARE A LITTLE BIT EASIER

03:42:31.638 --> 03:42:33.406
TO COME BY.

03:42:33.473 --> 03:42:34.741
TO.

03:42:34.808 --> 03:42:36.910
SENATOR MORLOCKS EARLIER GOING

03:42:36.976 --> 03:42:38.078
AND SOME OF THE POINTS RAISED BY

03:42:38.144 --> 03:42:39.512
THE COMMITTEE AT THE HOUSING

03:42:39.579 --> 03:42:42.282
FIRST OR MORE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

03:42:42.348 --> 03:42:44.084
THAT'S WHERE COUNTIES REALLY CAN

03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:46.553
HELP AND SO I THINK WERE REALLY

03:42:46.619 --> 03:42:48.588
HOPING FOR A BLENDED MODEL HERE

03:42:48.655 --> 03:42:49.489
WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES TO

03:42:49.556 --> 03:42:51.157
ADDRESS WHAT'S.

03:42:51.224 --> 03:42:52.625
I'M OBVIOUSLY A CRISIS RIGHT NOW

03:42:52.692 --> 03:42:54.394
THEIR STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU

03:42:54.461 --> 03:43:00.066
MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE RESPONSE.

OKAY SCENE NO OTHER. ARE

03:43:02.502 --> 03:43:04.237
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE WILL

03:43:04.304 --> 03:43:05.271
MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO.

03:43:05.338 --> 03:43:06.706
TAX PER

03:43:06.773 --> 03:43:19.119
TAX PROPOSALS.

03:43:19.185 --> 03:43:25.492
GOOD AFTERNOON.

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

03:43:28.361 --> 03:43:29.796
ISSUE TWO IS.

03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:32.198
ACTUALLY EIGHT DIFFERENCES

03:43:32.265 --> 03:43:33.867
BETWEEN THE HOUSE HOUSES.

03:43:33.933 --> 03:43:35.101
ON.

03:43:35.168 --> 03:43:37.203
VARIOUS TAX PROVISIONS.

TABLE ON PAGE TWELVE SUMMARIZES.

03:43:40.373 --> 03:43:42.242
THESE DIFFERENCES AND.

03:43:42.308 --> 03:43:42.809
WRITE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF

03:43:42.876 --> 03:43:44.177
EACH OF THEM.

03:43:44.244 --> 03:43:45.779
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

03:43:45.845 --> 03:43:47.213
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THE

03:43:47.280 --> 03:43:48.314
HIGHER CREDIT. THE

03:43:48.381 --> 03:43:49.149
ADMINISTRATION DID NOT HAVE A

03:43:49.215 --> 03:43:51.084
PROPOSALS.

03:43:51.151 --> 03:43:53.086
I'M IN THE COST OF THE TABLE.

03:43:53.153 --> 03:43:55.054
OUR THE GENERAL FUND REVENUE

03:43:55.121 --> 03:43:55.588
LOSSES WHO TWENTY EIGHTEEN

03:43:55.655 --> 03:43:57.257
NINETEEN.

03:43:57.323 --> 03:43:59.459
AND THEIR RELATIVE TO CURRENT

03:43:59.526 --> 03:44:01.628
LAW. AND NOT THE GOVERNOR'S

03:44:01.694 --> 03:44:03.863
BUDGET AND SO FOR EXAMPLE MOST

03:44:03.930 --> 03:44:05.131
OF THESE DON'T HAVE ON THAT AS A

03:44:05.198 --> 03:44:06.132
MATTER TOO MUCH FROM THE CITIES

MY RECOLLECTION ON THE HIRING

03:47:31.537 --> 03:47:33.773
CREDIT IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

03:47:33.840 --> 03:47:35.441
WHAT THE SENATE THE ACTIONS

03:47:35.508 --> 03:47:36.776

HIRING CREDITS PROVIDE A

03:47:44.984 --> 03:47:46.619
STRONGER INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYERS

03:47:46.686 --> 03:47:49.088
HIRE HARD TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS.

03:47:49.155 --> 03:47:51.524
BY EXPANDING THE EXISTING CREDIT

03:47:51.591 --> 03:47:53.626
IN A COUPLE OF WAYS ONE WE

03:47:53.693 --> 03:47:55.228
INCREASE THE QUALIFYING WAGE

03:47:55.294 --> 03:47:57.096
RANGE TO ONE HUNDRED.

03:47:57.163 --> 03:47:58.798
TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT

03:47:58.865 --> 03:48:00.299
OF MINIMUM WAGE VERSES ONE

03:48:00.366 --> 03:48:01.768
HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED

03:48:01.834 --> 03:48:03.703
FIFTY PERCENT. WE ELIMINATE THE

03:48:03.770 --> 03:48:05.171
REQUIREMENT THAT NEW HIRES BE

03:48:05.238 --> 03:48:06.773
LOCATED IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC

03:48:06.839 --> 03:48:08.674

ANSWERED RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICE

03:48:10.076 --> 03:48:12.445
INDUSTRIES. THE EXISTING HIRING

03:48:12.512 --> 03:48:14.414
TAX CREDIT WAS UNDER UTILIZED

03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:16.349
AND SO WE PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL

03:48:16.416 --> 03:48:17.283
THAT WE THOUGHT AND WOOD.

03:48:17.350 --> 03:48:19.085
INCREASE OUR UTILIZATION OF

03:48:19.152 --> 03:48:21.888
THIS CREDIT.

03:48:21.954 --> 03:48:23.456
SO THE THRESHOLD IS THREE

03:48:23.523 --> 03:48:24.390
HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF

03:48:24.457 --> 03:48:27.060
MINIMUM WAGE.

03:48:27.126 --> 03:48:29.028

03:48:29.095 --> 03:48:30.196
THRESHOLD J. CHAIRMAN AND

03:48:30.263 --> 03:48:31.464
PATTERNS

03:48:31.531 --> 03:48:32.965
ARE THE THRESHOLD IS AT HIS

03:48:33.032 --> 03:48:34.033
PROPOSED TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT

03:48:34.100 --> 03:48:35.535
OF MINIMUM WAGE UP TO THREE

03:48:35.601 --> 03:48:37.437
HUNDRED FIFTY SO FOR PAIN. THREE

03:48:37.503 --> 03:48:39.105
HUNDRED SIXTY ONLY GET THEIR

03:48:39.172 --> 03:48:39.939
CREDIT BETWEEN HIGHLIGHTED THREE

03:48:40.006 --> 03:48:41.541
AND FIFTY THAT MAKES THAT MAKES

03:48:41.607 --> 03:48:43.209
SENSE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH

03:48:43.276 --> 03:48:44.811
THE ORIGINAL HIRING CREDIT FROM

03:48:44.877 --> 03:48:46.546
MY PERSPECTIVE WAS IT WAS. AS I

03:48:46.612 --> 03:48:47.814
RECALL HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT

03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:49.715
OF MINIMUM WAGE IN IS THE

03:48:49.782 --> 03:48:51.384
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASED.

03:48:51.451 --> 03:48:52.685
IN SOME PORTIONS OF THE STATE OF

03:48:52.752 --> 03:48:54.720
CALIFORNIA WAS VERY DIFFICULT.

03:48:54.787 --> 03:48:55.655
FOR AN EMPLOYER TO TAKE

03:48:55.721 --> 03:48:57.390
ADVANTAGE OF THE HIRING TAX

03:48:57.457 --> 03:48:59.358
CREDITS SO I THINK FRANKLY FROM

03:48:59.425 --> 03:49:01.494
MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S A GOOD MOVE.

03:49:01.561 --> 03:49:02.028
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

03:49:02.095 --> 03:49:03.196
DIFFERENCE

03:49:03.262 --> 03:49:04.597
UPON THE EARNED INCOME TAX

03:49:04.664 --> 03:49:04.831
CREDIT.

03:49:04.897 --> 03:49:06.532
.

03:49:06.599 --> 03:49:08.201
APPRECIATE THE EXPANSION ONE OF

03:49:08.267 --> 03:49:08.367
THE.

03:49:08.434 --> 03:49:08.935
.

03:49:09.001 --> 03:49:11.037
OPPONENTS.

03:49:11.104 --> 03:49:14.474
CONCERNS WAS THAT AS A STATE.

03:49:14.540 --> 03:49:16.309
WE'RE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH MONEY

03:49:16.375 --> 03:49:18.077
ON OUT OF REACH IT'S ONE THING

03:49:18.144 --> 03:49:19.745
TO EXPAND THE EITC EVEN IF

03:49:19.812 --> 03:49:21.814
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING

03:49:21.881 --> 03:49:23.716
TO GET TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO.

03:49:23.783 --> 03:49:25.451
FILE IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF IT

03:49:25.518 --> 03:49:28.187
IT DOESN'T DO MUCH EXCEPT.

03:49:28.254 --> 03:49:29.222
PUT SOMETHING ON THE BOOKS

03:49:29.288 --> 03:49:30.456
THAT'S UNDER SUBSCRIBED OR UNDER

03:49:30.523 --> 03:49:32.725
UTILIZED.

03:49:32.792 --> 03:49:33.126
DID.

03:49:33.192 --> 03:49:35.228
HAVE WE DONE ANYTHING TO

03:49:35.294 --> 03:49:37.463
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OUT REACH

03:49:37.530 --> 03:49:39.232
DOLLARS THAT WEIRD.

03:49:39.298 --> 03:49:40.500
DEDICATING IN THE BUDGET TO THIS

03:49:40.566 --> 03:49:44.103
PARTICULAR PROGRAM.

03:49:44.170 --> 03:49:46.139
IF I MAY ASSERTIVE HOUSES ACTED

03:49:46.205 --> 03:49:47.473
TO PROVIDE TWENTY MILLION

03:49:47.540 --> 03:49:49.142
DOLLARS NOW.

03:49:49.208 --> 03:49:50.810
FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT

03:49:50.877 --> 03:49:52.745
AND THAT'S AN INCREASE OF.

03:49:52.812 --> 03:49:53.846
WELL THERE IS NOTHING IN THE

03:49:53.913 --> 03:49:54.914
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO IT'S AN

03:49:54.981 --> 03:49:56.249
INCREASE OF TWENTY MILLION.

03:49:56.315 --> 03:50:00.520
OKAY.

03:50:00.586 --> 03:50:01.921
AND WHO'S NOT THINK VERY MUCH OF

03:50:01.988 --> 03:50:02.955
WHICH CHIU IT IF I COULD ASK

03:50:03.022 --> 03:50:05.291
YOUR QUESTION SENATOR ROBB IS

03:50:05.358 --> 03:50:06.859
THE QUESTION ALSO WHAT WE SPENT

03:50:06.926 --> 03:50:08.661
OUT REACH LAST YEAR JUST TO GET

03:50:08.728 --> 03:50:10.096
A SENSE OF.

03:50:10.163 --> 03:50:10.730
IF WE'RE DOING BETTER OR NOT I

03:50:10.796 --> 03:50:11.864

REACH INTO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

03:50:16.335 --> 03:50:18.171
IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE FIRST

03:50:45.932 --> 03:50:47.333
NUMBER OF EITC RETURNS THAT WE

I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I THINK

03:51:34.547 --> 03:51:35.047
WE NEED TO PRACTICE WHAT WE

03:51:35.114 --> 03:51:36.782
PREACH.

03:51:36.849 --> 03:51:36.949

03:51:40.253 --> 03:51:41.454
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

03:51:41.520 --> 03:51:42.488
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA TERMINATE A

03:51:42.555 --> 03:51:44.523
BUSINESS THAT'S.

03:51:44.590 --> 03:51:46.626
UTILIZING DEVELOPMENTALLY

03:51:46.692 --> 03:51:47.226
DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS I'D

03:51:47.293 --> 03:51:53.065
LIKE THAT STEP UP FOR THAT GROUP.

03:51:53.132 --> 03:51:55.468
THIS ISSUE OF FUNDING FOR THAT

03:51:55.534 --> 03:51:56.435
GROUP I THINK IS GOING TO BE

03:51:56.502 --> 03:51:59.238
DISCUSSED BUT THAT PARTICULAR.

03:51:59.305 --> 03:52:00.873
ISSUE WASN'T IN CONFERENCE BUT.

03:52:00.940 --> 03:52:02.108
.

03:52:02.174 --> 03:52:09.282
IT IS CORRUPTS.

03:52:09.348 --> 03:52:10.616
I THINK A LOT A LOT OF OUR

03:52:10.683 --> 03:52:12.952
TRAILER BILL PASSED YEAH SO I I

03:52:13.019 --> 03:52:14.654
THINK MAYBE WHEN WE DISCUSS THAT

03:52:14.720 --> 03:52:17.290
ISSUE. HOME ON WEDNESDAY THAT

03:52:17.356 --> 03:52:18.457
WOULD BE A GREAT TIME TO BRING

03:52:18.524 --> 03:52:20.459
UP YOUR GREAT CHAIR THANKS FOR

03:52:20.526 --> 03:52:25.231
GIVING HIM DIRECTIONS.

03:52:25.298 --> 03:52:26.699
MY QUESTION IS ON THE HIRING

03:52:26.766 --> 03:52:27.633
CREDIT SO.

03:52:27.700 --> 03:52:30.469
WE HAVE.

03:52:30.536 --> 03:52:33.139
VERY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

03:52:33.205 --> 03:52:35.474
AND CURRENTLY ARE HIRING CREDIT

03:52:35.541 --> 03:52:37.610
IS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS

03:52:37.677 --> 03:52:40.179
VERY UNDER UTILIZED.

03:52:40.246 --> 03:52:41.681
AND YET THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:52:41.747 --> 03:52:43.849
PROPOSAL TO EXPAND IT.

03:52:43.916 --> 03:52:46.085
.

03:52:46.152 --> 03:52:49.455
THE LOGIC PLEASE.

03:52:49.522 --> 03:52:50.790
I KNOW THAT I WOULD CLASSIFY IT

03:52:50.856 --> 03:52:52.858
AS AN EXPANSION I WOULD SAY THAT

03:52:52.925 --> 03:52:55.261
THE ORIGINAL HIRING TAX CREDIT

03:52:55.328 --> 03:52:56.395
WAS REALLY UNDER UTILIZING THINK

03:52:56.462 --> 03:52:57.763
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE ARE

03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:59.065
AT VERY.

03:52:59.131 --> 03:53:01.233
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE NOW SO

03:53:01.300 --> 03:53:03.703
WE'VE TAYLOR DAY IN A WAY TO

03:53:03.769 --> 03:53:05.671
REALLY TARGET THE HARD HIGHER

03:53:05.738 --> 03:53:07.173
POPULATION AND THAT INCLUDES

03:53:07.239 --> 03:53:08.274
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RECENTLY

03:53:08.341 --> 03:53:09.642
INCARCERATED CAL WORKS

03:53:09.709 --> 03:53:12.178
RECIPIENTS. THOSE WHO EVEN IN

03:53:12.244 --> 03:53:13.512
THE REALM OF FULL EMPLOYMENT ARE

03:53:13.579 --> 03:53:14.413
STILL HAVING DIFFICULTY

03:53:14.480 --> 03:53:18.384
OBTAINING A JOB.

03:53:18.451 --> 03:53:20.553
SO WOULD WE REVERT THE FUNDS

03:53:20.619 --> 03:53:24.156
THAT WE.

03:53:24.223 --> 03:53:25.891
I DON'T KNOW IF WE.

03:53:25.958 --> 03:53:28.094
WE.

03:53:28.160 --> 03:53:31.230
IN ADOPTING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET.

03:53:31.297 --> 03:53:32.298
WE OBVIOUSLY.

03:53:32.365 --> 03:53:33.265
SHOWED.

03:53:33.332 --> 03:53:35.134
.

03:53:35.201 --> 03:53:36.702
AN EXPECTATION OF A CERTAIN

03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:38.504
AMOUNT DID SINCE THE TAX CREDIT

03:53:38.571 --> 03:53:40.673
IS AN EXPENDITURE. WE EXPECTED A

03:53:40.740 --> 03:53:42.308
CERTAIN EXPENDITURE WHICH WE DID

03:53:42.375 --> 03:53:45.077
NOT RECEIVE I THINK THAT SIMILAR

03:53:45.144 --> 03:53:46.479
TO WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE EYE

03:53:46.545 --> 03:53:47.012
CAN SEE BUT FOR DIFFERENT

03:53:47.079 --> 03:53:47.980
REASONS.

03:53:48.047 --> 03:53:51.417
SO WOULD WE BE.

03:53:51.484 --> 03:53:54.954
.

03:53:55.020 --> 03:53:55.988
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:53:56.055 --> 03:53:58.758
PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED TO GROW IN

03:53:58.824 --> 03:54:00.226
IS EXPECTED TO GROW.

03:54:00.292 --> 03:54:01.327
BECAUSE WE'RE TARGETING A

03:54:01.394 --> 03:54:04.697
DIFFERENT POPULATION.

03:54:04.764 --> 03:54:07.466
HOME IF I MAY UM THE THE

03:54:07.533 --> 03:54:08.968
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL.

03:54:09.034 --> 03:54:10.970
EXPANDS THE CREDIT AND INTO

03:54:11.036 --> 03:54:12.838
IMPORTANT HUESO AS ARM WAS

03:54:12.905 --> 03:54:14.273
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IT REDUCES

03:54:14.340 --> 03:54:15.841
THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH EMPLOYEES

03:54:15.908 --> 03:54:18.577
QUALIFY. FOR THE THE SUBSIDY BY

03:54:18.644 --> 03:54:20.346
BY MOVING INTO A.

03:54:20.413 --> 03:54:21.547
A FULL MY HUNTER PERCENT OF

03:54:21.614 --> 03:54:23.416
MINIMUM WAGE.

03:54:23.482 --> 03:54:24.850
AND THE SEWERS BILLION WARRIORS

03:54:24.917 --> 03:54:25.951
YOU COULD MYERS QUALIFIED

03:54:26.018 --> 03:54:27.653
EMPLOYERS RIGHT KNOWN WILL THE

03:54:27.720 --> 03:54:30.022
EMPLOYEES THE EMPLOYER QUALIFIES

03:54:30.089 --> 03:54:32.091
BY HIRING AN EMPLOYEE. OKAY AND

03:54:32.158 --> 03:54:33.659
UNDER THE EXISTING TAX CREDIT

03:54:33.726 --> 03:54:35.394
YOU HAVE TO HIRE THE EMPLOYEE

03:54:35.461 --> 03:54:37.663
THE NEW EMPLOYEE AT A HUNDRED

03:54:37.730 --> 03:54:38.297
FIFTY PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE AT

03:54:38.364 --> 03:54:39.265
LEAST.

03:54:39.331 --> 03:54:39.899
AND SO THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A

03:54:39.965 --> 03:54:41.267
BARRIER IN ADDITION IT WAS

03:54:41.333 --> 03:54:42.802
LIMITED TO CERTAIN ZONES THE

03:54:42.868 --> 03:54:44.303
STATE FORMER ENTERPRISE ZONES

03:54:44.370 --> 03:54:45.371
AND WE'RE NEXT THE THE

03:54:45.438 --> 03:54:46.305
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

03:54:46.372 --> 03:54:49.308
EXPAND STATEWIDE.

03:54:49.375 --> 03:54:52.211
OKAY.

03:54:52.278 --> 03:54:53.312
THANK YOU CENTER ROTH JUST TO

03:54:53.379 --> 03:54:54.880
FOLLOW UP I I THINK IT'S REALLY

03:54:54.947 --> 03:54:56.816
VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT.

03:54:56.882 --> 03:54:58.984
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PAYING.

03:54:59.051 --> 03:55:00.286
SOMEONE IN THE HARD THE HIGHER

03:55:00.352 --> 03:55:02.254
CATEGORY THAT IS JUST EXPLAINED

03:55:02.321 --> 03:55:03.322
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF

03:55:03.389 --> 03:55:04.723
MINIMUM WAGE.

03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:06.091
THAT'S PROBABLY MAYBE A BRIDGE

03:55:06.158 --> 03:55:07.560
TOO FAR YOU'RE LIMITING THE

03:55:07.626 --> 03:55:09.628
JURORS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE

03:55:09.695 --> 03:55:10.996
STATE AND ALSO SOME OF THE

03:55:11.063 --> 03:55:11.630
OCCUPATIONS DID WE CHANGE THAT

03:55:11.697 --> 03:55:17.303
AS WELL.

03:55:17.369 --> 03:55:19.672
YES WHAT WE WE CHANGE THE

03:55:19.738 --> 03:55:21.207
INDUSTRIES THAT INDUSTRY RECALL.

03:55:21.273 --> 03:55:22.541
SO PLAYERS.

03:55:22.608 --> 03:55:24.043
UNDER OUR PROPOSAL WOULD BE

03:55:24.109 --> 03:55:25.110
COULD BE IN THE RETAILER OR FOOD

03:55:25.177 --> 03:55:26.245
SERVICES.

03:55:26.312 --> 03:55:28.347
SO THAT'S IMPORTANT.

03:55:28.414 --> 03:55:30.349
SPANNING THE GEOGRAPHY AND

03:55:30.416 --> 03:55:31.350
LOWERING THE THRESHOLD TO A

03:55:31.417 --> 03:55:32.651
HUNDRED PERCENT OF MINIMUM WAGE

03:55:32.718 --> 03:55:33.786
FOR THE TARGETED GROUP OF

03:55:33.853 --> 03:55:35.387
POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES WERE TALKING

03:55:35.454 --> 03:55:37.256
ABOUT. I THINK WE WOULD BE

03:55:37.323 --> 03:55:38.791
INTERESTING TO SEE AN OBVIOUSLY

03:55:38.858 --> 03:55:39.859
WE WILL BE STUDYING IT WATCHING

03:55:39.925 --> 03:55:41.861
IT SO WHEN YOU I THINK WE WILL

03:55:41.927 --> 03:55:43.195
BE EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM I

03:55:43.262 --> 03:55:44.430
THINK IS FOR HIM DOES A VERY

03:55:44.497 --> 03:55:48.834
IMPORTANT CHANGES.

03:55:48.901 --> 03:55:50.402
DOCTOR ABOUT.

03:55:50.469 --> 03:55:52.004
I WANTED A COMMENT IN THIS AREA

03:55:52.071 --> 03:55:52.304
IF I COULD.

03:55:52.371 --> 03:55:52.938
.

03:55:53.005 --> 03:55:55.241
I.

03:55:55.307 --> 03:55:56.609
IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS

03:55:56.675 --> 03:55:58.410
HIRING CREDIT I KNOW YOU HAVE

03:55:58.477 --> 03:55:59.712
SAID THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN

03:55:59.778 --> 03:56:02.114
SUBSCRIBED WELL BUT I THINK IT'S.

03:56:02.181 --> 03:56:03.716
THE PORN TO PUT NUMBERS TO IT.

03:56:03.782 --> 03:56:05.351
MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE'VE HAD

03:56:05.417 --> 03:56:07.353
WANTED TO PERCENT PARTICIPATION

03:56:07.419 --> 03:56:08.787
BASED ON HOW MUCH WE'VE

03:56:08.854 --> 03:56:10.456
ALLOCATED FOR THIS TAX CREDIT.

03:56:10.523 --> 03:56:11.824
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE

03:56:11.891 --> 03:56:14.159
DECISIONS THAT WE'VE.

03:56:14.226 --> 03:56:15.194
MADE AND HOW WE'VE.

03:56:15.761 --> 03:56:18.297
STRUCTURE DISCREDIT.

03:56:18.364 --> 03:56:20.366
I WANTED JUST PUT A TIMESTAMP

03:56:20.432 --> 03:56:22.535
NOW TO RE EVALUATE THIS PROGRAM

03:56:22.601 --> 03:56:24.503
AFTER YEAR TO SEE IF THE CHANGES

03:56:24.570 --> 03:56:26.939
IN THE VARIABLES. HAVE WORKED

03:56:27.006 --> 03:56:29.742
IF WEATHERED. OR CHANGING FROM

03:56:29.808 --> 03:56:32.011
RESTAURANTS AND RETAILS OR

03:56:32.077 --> 03:56:33.212
PAT DECREASING FROM A HUNDRED

03:56:33.279 --> 03:56:34.413
AND FIFTY TO A HUNDRED PERCENT

03:56:34.480 --> 03:56:35.514
REALLY DO HELP.

03:56:35.581 --> 03:56:37.383
BECAUSE.

03:56:37.449 --> 03:56:39.685
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT I DO THINK

03:56:39.752 --> 03:56:41.086
WE CAN MAKE SURE THIS PROGRAM IS

03:56:41.153 --> 03:56:43.255
SUBSCRIBED TO IS HAVING A

03:56:43.322 --> 03:56:45.224
PROGRAM. THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE

03:56:45.291 --> 03:56:46.559
WELL TO THE RETAILERS AND

03:56:46.625 --> 03:56:47.927
RESTAURANTS IN THE BUSINESSES

03:56:47.993 --> 03:56:49.962
WHO WILL USE THESE TAX CREDITS.

03:56:50.029 --> 03:56:52.565
AND MY CONCERN IS ON HOW WE'VE

03:56:52.631 --> 03:56:53.699
STRUCTURED CONCERNED JUST GONNA

03:56:53.766 --> 03:56:55.901
VOICE THAT CONCERN BUT THE.

03:56:55.968 --> 03:56:57.436
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT ABOVE

03:56:57.503 --> 03:56:58.871
MINIMUM WAGE REALLY DOES

03:56:58.938 --> 03:57:00.372
DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT THOSE

03:57:00.439 --> 03:57:02.341
WHO ARE ON THE LOWER END OF THE

03:57:02.408 --> 03:57:04.610
WAGE SCALE VERSUS THOSE WHO ARE.

03:57:04.677 --> 03:57:06.211
.

03:57:06.278 --> 03:57:07.880
TURNING THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR

03:57:07.947 --> 03:57:10.583
VERSES ELEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR

03:57:10.649 --> 03:57:13.586

DO WE IN FUTURE YEARS COME BACK

03:57:18.057 --> 03:57:19.558
TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT

03:57:19.625 --> 03:57:20.926
THERE'S A DIFFERENT MECHANISM.

03:57:20.993 --> 03:57:23.095
TO HAVE THIS TAX CREDIT IF

03:57:23.162 --> 03:57:24.964
THERE'S A DOLLAR PER HOUR. THAT

03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:26.665
WE COULD BE APPLYING UNTIL WE

03:57:26.732 --> 03:57:28.534
REACHED A THRESHOLD WHERE IF

THOUGH FOR A TAX CREDIT ONE YEAR

03:57:40.546 --> 03:57:42.214

COMPANY CAN GO BACK AND CLEAN

03:57:48.621 --> 03:57:50.522
THEIR CREDIT AND SO THAT WOULD

03:57:50.589 --> 03:57:51.724
LIKELY TAKE LONGER TO HAVE A.

03:57:51.790 --> 03:57:53.559

04:09:32.757 --> 04:09:33.591
BROUGHT IT UP WE DO HAVE

04:09:33.658 --> 04:09:34.759
CONCERNS FOR THE SENATE PROPOSAL

04:09:34.826 --> 04:09:36.361
HOW THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

04:09:36.428 --> 04:09:37.829
SERVICES ADMINISTERED THE YOUTH

04:09:37.896 --> 04:09:39.297
AND ADULT. RE ENTRY AND

04:09:39.364 --> 04:09:40.999
DIVERSION PROGRAM GRANTS JUST

04:09:41.066 --> 04:09:42.500
BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT

04:09:42.567 --> 04:09:43.802
TYPICALLY ADMINISTERED THESE

04:09:43.868 --> 04:09:45.637
TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND SO WE

04:09:45.704 --> 04:09:46.538
THINK THAT THERE'S LIKELY A

04:09:46.604 --> 04:09:48.373
BETTER ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITY. TO

04:09:48.440 --> 04:09:50.642
ADMINISTER THAT PROGRAM. ON AND

04:09:50.709 --> 04:09:51.676
THEN ON THE SENATE YOUTH AND

04:09:51.743 --> 04:09:53.411
ADULT REENTRY INTO A VERSION AND.

04:09:53.478 --> 04:09:55.880
PROGRAM PACKAGE AS A WHOLE WE

04:09:55.947 --> 04:09:57.449
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS AND

04:09:57.515 --> 04:09:59.918
AS SUCH WE CAN'T REALLY COMMENTS.

04:09:59.984 --> 04:10:04.055
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

04:10:04.122 --> 04:10:07.459
HER SKIRT.

04:10:07.525 --> 04:10:08.927
IF WE NEED LOOK AT THE OFFICE OF

04:10:08.993 --> 04:10:10.362
EMERGENCY SERVICES.

04:10:10.428 --> 04:10:12.397
.

04:10:12.464 --> 04:10:14.165
THEY ADMINISTER A LOT OF.

04:10:14.232 --> 04:10:16.401
GRANT PROGRAMS.

04:10:16.468 --> 04:10:19.270
AND FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE.

04:10:19.337 --> 04:10:21.339
AND STILL DO ADMINISTER VARIOUS

04:10:21.406 --> 04:10:24.142
GRANT PROGRAMS THAT.

04:10:24.209 --> 04:10:26.044
HAVE AN OVERLAP WITH SOME TYPES

04:10:26.111 --> 04:10:27.379
OF RE ENTRY SERVICES.

04:10:27.445 --> 04:10:29.547
.

04:10:29.614 --> 04:10:33.351
SO THERE THERE ARE. EXISTING

04:10:33.418 --> 04:10:34.652
STRUCTURES THAT.

04:10:34.719 --> 04:10:38.223
.

04:10:38.289 --> 04:10:39.958
THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS

04:10:40.024 --> 04:10:42.227
PRESENTED HERE COULD FIT IN.

04:10:42.293 --> 04:10:46.197
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

04:10:46.264 --> 04:10:47.298
ASSEMBLY SAN ME.

04:10:47.365 --> 04:10:49.534
SENATE'S

04:10:49.601 --> 04:10:51.035
ACTION WHICH WAS ALREADY POINTED

04:10:51.102 --> 04:10:53.705
OUT BUT BASICALLY BOTH HOUSES.

04:10:53.772 --> 04:10:56.074
SUPPORTED THE FIFTEEN MILLION TO

04:10:56.141 --> 04:10:57.375
PUT SOCIAL WORKERS IN PUBLIC

04:10:57.442 --> 04:10:58.843
DEFENDER'S OFFICE SUPPORTED

04:10:58.910 --> 04:11:00.545
FIFTY MILLION FOR RE ENTRY

04:11:00.612 --> 04:11:03.915
HOUSING. IF WE TALKED TO THE IF

04:11:03.982 --> 04:11:05.517
WE TALK TOWARD COUNTIES IF WE

04:11:05.583 --> 04:11:06.818
TALK TO OUR.

04:11:06.885 --> 04:11:08.353
ENTITIES THAT DO RE ENTRY

04:11:08.420 --> 04:11:10.455
SUPPORT AND EVEN TO CDC ARE

04:11:10.522 --> 04:11:12.924
BECAUSE NOW OUR CORRECTIONS

04:11:12.991 --> 04:11:15.126
DIVISION CASTING DO. EVERY ENTRY

04:11:15.193 --> 04:11:18.062
PLAN. BEFORE PEOPLE ARE RELEASED

04:11:18.129 --> 04:11:20.398
AND THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT COMES

04:11:20.465 --> 04:11:22.400
UP AGAIN AND AGAIN IS WHERE

04:11:22.467 --> 04:11:24.502
THESE FOLKS GOING TO BE HOUSED.

04:11:24.569 --> 04:11:24.836
AND.

04:11:24.903 --> 04:11:27.705
SO BOTH HOUSES FELT TO IS

04:11:27.772 --> 04:11:29.774
PROPRIOCEPTIVE BECAUSE THAT IS

04:11:29.841 --> 04:11:31.910
WHAT WE'VE IN EVERY INQUIRY WE

04:11:31.976 --> 04:11:33.912
MAKE AS TO WHAT'S ONE OF THE

04:11:33.978 --> 04:11:36.748
LARGEST NEEDS WERE TOLD.

04:11:36.815 --> 04:11:37.282
YOU KNOW AND IT RARE TREAT

04:11:37.348 --> 04:11:37.549
HOUSING.

04:11:37.615 --> 04:11:40.018
.

04:11:40.084 --> 04:11:41.586
AND THEN THE AREAS THAT. WAS

04:11:41.653 --> 04:11:43.922
JUST LANDED ON MUTUALLY WAS

04:11:43.988 --> 04:11:46.357
AROUND THE U. THREE INVESTMENT.

04:11:46.424 --> 04:11:48.460
AND SO CLEARLY THAT'S SOMETHING

04:11:48.526 --> 04:11:50.195
WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IF

04:11:50.261 --> 04:11:51.930
WE CALL THIS ITEM OPEN BUT THERE

04:11:51.996 --> 04:11:53.698
WAS A GREAT MERIT TOO MANY OF

04:11:53.765 --> 04:11:56.501
THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE DISCUSSED.

04:11:56.568 --> 04:11:59.437
WITHIN THAT YOU THREE INVESTMENT.

04:11:59.504 --> 04:12:01.439
HERTZBERG. FOR DIVERSION CORRECT

04:12:01.506 --> 04:12:03.441
IT WASN'T FOR RE ENTRY IS FOR

04:12:03.508 --> 04:12:04.576
DIVERSION BUT OBVIOUSLY.

04:12:04.642 --> 04:12:05.944
IT'S LIKE ANY AN OUNCE OF

04:12:06.010 --> 04:12:07.412
PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF

04:12:07.479 --> 04:12:09.614
CURE IF WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE FROM

04:12:09.681 --> 04:12:11.216
EVEN. ENTERING OUR CRIMINAL

04:12:11.282 --> 04:12:13.284
JUSTICE SYSTEM ALL THE BETTER

04:12:13.351 --> 04:12:14.586
AND THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THE

04:12:14.652 --> 04:12:14.786
YOUTH.

04:12:14.853 --> 04:12:15.820
INVESTMENT PROGRAM.

04:12:15.887 --> 04:12:19.123
THANK YOU.

DOCTOR ROBERT.

04:12:23.361 --> 04:12:24.996
I MISS COSTA YOU SAID THAT THERE

04:12:25.063 --> 04:12:25.497
WAS A.

04:12:25.563 --> 04:12:27.332
DEPARTMENT THAT MAY BE ABLE TO

04:12:27.398 --> 04:12:29.167
BETTER OVERSEE THAT PROGRAM AND

04:12:29.234 --> 04:12:30.535
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD

04:12:30.602 --> 04:12:31.169
ELUCIDATE WHICH DEPARTMENT THAT

04:12:31.236 --> 04:12:34.072
WOULD BE.

04:12:34.138 --> 04:12:35.373
JOSH DUGGAR DEPARTMENT FINANCE

04:12:35.440 --> 04:12:36.574
SO GENERALLY SPEAKING.

04:12:36.641 --> 04:12:38.142
SIMILAR PROGRAMS LIKE THIS HAVE

04:12:38.209 --> 04:12:39.010
BEEN FUNDED WITH THE BOARD OF

04:12:39.077 --> 04:12:40.512
SEEN CONNIE CORRECTIONS IN THE

04:12:40.578 --> 04:12:43.114
PAST AND OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON

04:12:43.181 --> 04:12:45.049
THE YOU KNOW VARIATION OF WHAT

04:12:45.116 --> 04:12:47.519
IS ACTUALLY BEING FUNDED AND THE.

04:12:47.585 --> 04:12:49.754
REENTRY POPULATION THAT IS

04:12:49.821 --> 04:12:51.356
FOCUSED ON I THINK THAT THERE'S

04:12:51.422 --> 04:12:52.957
ALSO A ROLE FOR HER CCAR'S

04:12:53.024 --> 04:12:54.092
FUNDING.

04:12:54.158 --> 04:12:56.294
CCR TO.

04:12:56.361 --> 04:12:57.061
BEING.

04:12:57.128 --> 04:12:59.130
OVERSEEN SIGNIFICANT FUNDING IN

04:12:59.197 --> 04:13:00.765
THIS AREA AS WELL TO THE EXTENT

04:13:00.832 --> 04:13:02.166
THAT IT'S PAROLEES WHICH I THINK

04:13:02.233 --> 04:13:03.668
UNDER CERTAIN VARIATIONS OF THE

04:13:03.735 --> 04:13:04.869
LANGUAGE.

04:13:04.936 --> 04:13:10.608
WOULD INCLUDE PAROLEES.

04:13:10.675 --> 04:13:13.611
SENATE NIELSEN.

04:13:13.678 --> 04:13:16.347
SOARING NIELSEN.

04:13:16.414 --> 04:13:18.650
JUST A CAUTION THIS IS NOT JUST

04:13:18.716 --> 04:13:20.051
A REALLY EASY

04:13:20.118 --> 04:13:23.755
AREA TO DEAL WITH

04:13:23.821 --> 04:13:24.389
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS.

04:13:24.455 --> 04:13:27.358
COOPER HOW YOU CRAFT THE PROGRAM.

04:13:27.425 --> 04:13:29.060
THERE IS A BOTTLE THAT DID WORK.

04:13:29.127 --> 04:13:30.628
FOR YEARS AND YEARS.

04:13:30.695 --> 04:13:31.529
IT'S CALLED.

04:13:31.596 --> 04:13:34.198
THE DRUG COURT.

04:13:34.265 --> 04:13:35.400
I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING

04:13:35.466 --> 04:13:36.067
TO BE MODELED ON THE DRUG COURT.

04:13:36.134 --> 04:13:37.435
BUT.

04:13:37.502 --> 04:13:39.437
THE POINT IS.

04:13:39.504 --> 04:13:40.939
IT IT IT'S JUST NOT AN EASY

04:13:41.005 --> 04:13:42.240
THING AND I WOULD BE VERY

04:13:42.307 --> 04:13:43.341
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HAVING THIS

04:13:43.408 --> 04:13:45.577
BE DEFINED IN A TRAILER BILL.

04:13:45.643 --> 04:13:47.779
THAT DOES NOT BE SUBJECTED TO

04:13:47.845 --> 04:13:50.014
EXHAUSTIVE COMMITTEE HEARING

04:13:50.081 --> 04:13:53.051

.

04:14:19.410 --> 04:14:21.646
TO REVIEW.

04:14:21.713 --> 04:14:22.680
I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

04:14:22.747 --> 04:14:23.881
ANALYST'S OFFICE

04:14:23.948 --> 04:14:25.116
AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWENTY

04:14:25.183 --> 04:14:26.718
SIX OF YOUR AGENDA WE FIRST

04:14:26.784 --> 04:14:27.619
PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF

04:14:27.685 --> 04:14:29.153
BACKGROUND. ON THE JUDICIAL

04:14:29.220 --> 04:14:30.855
BRANCHES WORKLOAD ALLOCATION AND

04:14:30.922 --> 04:14:31.990
FUNDING METHODOLOGY BETTER KNOWN

04:14:32.056 --> 04:14:33.324
AS WELL FROM.

04:14:33.391 --> 04:14:34.492
IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO

04:14:34.559 --> 04:14:36.094
THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN BY THE

04:14:36.160 --> 04:14:37.495

FUNDING BASED ON WORKLOAD.

04:14:42.734 --> 04:14:43.301
AND SO UNDER CHANGES THAT WERE

04:14:43.368 --> 04:14:44.736
ADOPTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

04:14:44.802 --> 04:14:47.372

04:14:50.341 --> 04:14:52.677
FIRST GO TO THE FIFTEEN SMALLEST

PERCENT OF ANY OF THE REMAINING

04:14:56.981 --> 04:14:58.583
AMOUNT WOULD GO TO THE COURTS

04:14:58.650 --> 04:14:59.751
THAT WERE BELOW THE STATEWIDE

04:14:59.817 --> 04:15:01.185
AVERAGE AND THAT ANY REMAINING

04:15:01.252 --> 04:15:03.054
AMOUNT WOULD GO TO ALL. THE

04:15:03.121 --> 04:15:04.889
COURTS BASED ON WORKLOAD.

04:15:04.956 --> 04:15:06.090
TO RETURN TO THE NEXT PAGE OF

04:15:06.157 --> 04:15:07.692
YOUR AGENDA WHO THE TABLE HERE

04:15:07.759 --> 04:15:09.227
THAT KIND OF SUMMARIZES THE

04:15:09.293 --> 04:15:10.862
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AS

04:15:10.928 --> 04:15:11.429
WELL AS THE ACTIONS OF BOTH

04:15:11.496 --> 04:15:12.697
HOUSES.

04:15:12.764 --> 04:15:13.531
UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S

04:15:13.598 --> 04:15:14.966

04:15:19.604 --> 04:15:20.805
FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION

04:15:20.872 --> 04:15:22.674
FOR EQUALIZATION AND BOTH HOUSES

04:15:22.740 --> 04:15:24.609
AGREED ON THAT.

04:15:24.676 --> 04:15:25.843
AND THE REMAINING AMOUNT

04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:26.944
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WOULD BE

04:15:27.011 --> 04:15:28.479
FOR DISCRETIONARY FUNDING TO GO

04:15:28.546 --> 04:15:29.881

PRIORITIES AND THIS IS WHERE THE

04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:34.085
TWO HOUSES DEFERRED.

04:15:34.152 --> 04:15:35.186
THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED THIRTY

PROCEEDINGS AND SPECIFY WHAT

04:15:59.410 --> 04:16:01.512
KEEPS TYPES WOULD HAVE PRIORITY

04:16:01.579 --> 04:16:02.080
OF INSUFFICIENT FUNDING WAS

04:16:02.146 --> 04:16:03.281
AVAILABLE.

04:16:03.347 --> 04:16:04.449
AS WELL IS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE

04:16:04.515 --> 04:16:05.983

IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHT MOST

04:16:11.956 --> 04:16:13.925
COLUMN OF THIS TABLE WE DO HAVE

04:16:13.991 --> 04:16:14.392
A COMPROMISE FOR YOUR

04:16:14.459 --> 04:16:15.860
CONSIDERATION. UNDER THE

04:16:15.927 --> 04:16:17.562
COMPROMISE IT WOULD BE A HUNDRED

04:16:17.628 --> 04:16:18.096
AND TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT

04:16:18.162 --> 04:16:19.197
MILLION.

04:16:19.263 --> 04:16:20.631
FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT GOING TO

04:16:20.698 --> 04:16:23.067
EQUALIZATION SIXTY MILLION GOING

04:16:23.134 --> 04:16:24.669
OUT ON A WALK OFF ON AND FIFTEEN

04:16:24.736 --> 04:16:26.370
MILLION FOUR COURT REPORTERS.

04:16:26.437 --> 04:16:27.538
AND ALSO THE SENATE LANGUAGE

04:16:27.605 --> 04:16:29.540
WOULD BE ADOPTED.

04:16:29.607 --> 04:16:30.341
IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE OF

04:16:30.408 --> 04:16:31.609
YOUR HAND UP PAGE THIRTY THE

04:16:31.676 --> 04:16:33.611
REASON FOR THIS COMPROMISE IS

04:16:33.678 --> 04:16:35.446
THAT IT WOULD GENERALLY SPECIFY

04:16:35.513 --> 04:16:36.681
FUNDING FOR LEGISLATIVE PROP.

04:16:36.748 --> 04:16:38.583
PRIORITIES RATHER THAN GIVING

04:16:38.649 --> 04:16:39.550
JUDICIAL COUNCIL COMPLETE

04:16:39.617 --> 04:16:40.985
DISCRETION.

04:16:41.052 --> 04:16:41.986
ADDITIONALLY THE SENATE'S

04:16:42.053 --> 04:16:43.154
PROPOSED LANGUAGE WOULD REALLY

04:16:43.221 --> 04:16:44.722
INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

04:16:44.789 --> 04:16:46.157
OF TRIAL COURT FUNDING WITHOUT

04:16:46.224 --> 04:16:48.693
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

04:16:48.760 --> 04:16:50.394
THIS COST.

04:16:50.461 --> 04:16:51.896
I THINK THE COURT ACTION CORE

04:16:51.963 --> 04:16:53.431
ISSUE HERE IS THE FLEXIBILITY

04:16:53.498 --> 04:16:55.533
THAT WE WOULD HAVE AFFORD THE

04:16:55.600 --> 04:16:57.235
JUDICIAL COUNCILS SO. ID

04:16:57.301 --> 04:16:58.970
MINISTRATION AS NOTED PROPOSED

04:16:59.036 --> 04:17:00.238
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT

04:17:00.304 --> 04:17:01.339
EIGHT MILLION SEVENTY FIVE

04:17:01.405 --> 04:17:02.406
MILLION OF WHICH IS

04:17:02.473 --> 04:17:04.075
DISCRETIONARY OUT TO SUPPORT

04:17:04.142 --> 04:17:06.077
TROUT CORE OPERATIONS PROVIDE

04:17:06.144 --> 04:17:07.879
RESOURCES AND FLEXIBILITY. FOR

04:17:07.945 --> 04:17:09.514
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND COURTS

04:17:09.580 --> 04:17:11.983
TO FIND LOCAL LEVEL PRIORITIES.

04:17:12.049 --> 04:17:13.451
WHICH COULD INCLUDE COURT

04:17:13.518 --> 04:17:14.719
REPORTING WE WOULD KNOW THAT

04:17:14.786 --> 04:17:16.487
CURRENTLY THIRTY EIGHT OF THE

04:17:16.554 --> 04:17:18.089
FIFTY EIGHT TRIAL PORTS YEARS

04:17:34.572 --> 04:17:36.374
GIVEN INCREASE OF FUNDING TO THE

04:17:36.440 --> 04:17:39.443
JUDICIAL. BRANCH.

04:17:39.510 --> 04:17:40.011
IT HASN'T OCCURRED DURING MY

04:17:40.077 --> 04:17:45.750
TENURE.

04:17:45.817 --> 04:17:48.219
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

YOU ALL KNOW BASED ON OUR

04:17:53.157 --> 04:17:54.425
PREVIOUS YEARS EXPERIENCE THAT

04:17:54.492 --> 04:17:56.227
I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF TRIAL

04:17:56.294 --> 04:17:57.461
COURT FUNDING INCREASING THAT

04:17:57.528 --> 04:17:58.796
FUNDING AND IT COMES OUT OF. MY

04:17:58.863 --> 04:18:00.531
EXPERIENCES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

04:18:00.598 --> 04:18:00.698
IS.

04:18:00.765 --> 04:18:02.166
MAYOR OF A COMMUNITY LOST A

04:18:02.233 --> 04:18:03.935
COURTHOUSE.

04:18:04.001 --> 04:18:04.802
SO I'M I'M A BELIEVER THAT

04:18:04.869 --> 04:18:06.704
FUNDING TRIAL COURTS INCREASES

04:18:06.771 --> 04:18:07.839
ACCESS TO JUSTICE DON'T THINK

04:18:07.905 --> 04:18:09.273
THAT'S ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL

04:18:09.340 --> 04:18:10.174
RESPONSIBILITIES OF GOVERNMENT

04:18:10.241 --> 04:18:11.576
ARE.

04:18:11.642 --> 04:18:13.711
THAT BEING SAID I AM VERY MUCH A

04:18:13.778 --> 04:18:15.313
FAN OF THE ILLEGAL COMPROMISED.

04:18:15.379 --> 04:18:16.180
JUST BECAUSE I THAT THAT'S

04:18:16.247 --> 04:18:17.381
WHAT'S GONNA MAXIMIZE THE

04:18:17.448 --> 04:18:18.850
FUNDING FOR THOSE TRIAL COURTS

04:18:18.916 --> 04:18:19.483
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE MONEY

04:18:19.550 --> 04:18:22.887
NEEDS TO GO.

04:18:22.954 --> 04:18:24.388

FROM.

04:18:29.393 --> 04:18:31.362
BIG BEAR THE WAFFEN FORMULA WAS

04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:33.731
DEVELOPED TO TRY TO. DEAL WITH

04:18:33.798 --> 04:18:35.800
AS SOME HISTORICALLY IMBALANCE

04:18:35.867 --> 04:18:36.868
IN THE WAY THE FUNDS WERE

04:18:36.934 --> 04:18:37.935
DISTRIBUTED IN HAVE BEEN

04:18:38.002 --> 04:18:39.036
DISTRIBUTED IN THE STATE OF

04:18:39.103 --> 04:18:40.404
CALIFORNIA AND.

04:18:40.471 --> 04:18:42.340
I THINK IF ANYTHING WE SHOULD

04:18:42.406 --> 04:18:44.075
EMPHASIZE OF THE USE OF THAT

04:18:44.141 --> 04:18:46.344
FORMULA NOT RETURNED TO.

04:18:46.410 --> 04:18:48.279
HISTORIC PRACTICES WHERE MONEY

04:18:48.346 --> 04:18:49.847
WAS DISTRIBUTED.

04:18:49.914 --> 04:18:51.249
IN A PARTICULAR WAY JUST

04:18:51.315 --> 04:18:52.683
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT ALWAYS

04:18:52.750 --> 04:18:54.719
BEEN DISTRIBUTED DESPITE.

04:18:54.785 --> 04:18:56.354
OF THE MOVEMENT AND SHIFT IN

04:18:56.420 --> 04:18:58.222

IN CALIFORNIA A NORTH SOUTH SO.

04:19:03.794 --> 04:19:05.630
I'M CERTAINLY A FAN OF THE

04:19:05.696 --> 04:19:07.732
WATSON FORMULA AND WHICH SPORT

04:19:07.798 --> 04:19:09.066
EITHER ACTUALLY EITHER APPROACH

FROM THE ADMINISTRATION DOES

04:19:17.541 --> 04:19:19.277
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY

04:19:19.343 --> 04:19:20.645
TO DO IT IN THE SPECIFIED TIME

04:19:20.711 --> 04:19:22.914
PERIOD AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE

04:19:22.980 --> 04:19:25.116

04:19:25.182 --> 04:19:26.951
WORK ON AND WITH THE HOUSE IS

04:19:27.018 --> 04:19:29.487
PROPOSING.

SENATOR MORLOCKS QUESTIONS SORRY

THERE'S A LONG HISTORY AS YOU'VE

NOTED THAT THIS AND I WAS.

04:20:08.960 --> 04:20:10.795
PRESENT AT THE BIRTH EVEN IN THE

04:20:10.861 --> 04:20:11.562

AND IT HAS A LONG AND STORIED

04:20:14.865 --> 04:20:16.600
HISTORY THAT THOSE ALSO HARKEN

04:20:16.667 --> 04:20:17.969
TO SOMETHING I SPEAK A LOT ABOUT

04:20:18.035 --> 04:20:20.471
AND THAT IS TRUST.

04:20:20.538 --> 04:20:22.406
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW TIMES IN

04:20:22.473 --> 04:20:24.041
HISTORY.

04:20:24.108 --> 04:20:25.309
RELEASED IN THE HISTORY OF MY

04:20:25.376 --> 04:20:26.644
DEALINGS WITH THE LEGISLATURE

04:20:26.711 --> 04:20:29.747
WHERE THE. COUNTIES.

04:20:29.814 --> 04:20:30.348
COULD KEEP THEIR TRUST IN THE

04:20:30.414 --> 04:20:31.816
STATE.

04:20:31.882 --> 04:20:32.717

COURT FUNDING.

04:20:37.254 --> 04:20:38.956
AND.

04:20:39.023 --> 04:20:40.958
ANY GREAT DEPARTURES.

04:20:41.025 --> 04:20:42.760
FOR MORE WHERE THAT CAUSES ME.

04:20:42.827 --> 04:20:44.996
CONCERN.

04:20:45.062 --> 04:20:47.832
HEY AND.

04:20:47.898 --> 04:20:49.867
THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

04:20:49.934 --> 04:20:51.402
SHE DID CORRECT INEQUITIES THAT

04:20:51.469 --> 04:20:53.270
DID DEVELOP.

04:20:53.337 --> 04:20:54.572
HIS.

04:20:54.638 --> 04:20:56.140
PREDICTABLE.

04:20:56.207 --> 04:20:58.576
THERE'S NO.

04:20:58.642 --> 04:21:00.411
AND COUNTIES HAVE.

04:21:00.478 --> 04:21:02.179
PLANNED BASED ON WHAT THEIR

04:21:02.246 --> 04:21:04.715
EXPECTATION WAS.

04:21:04.782 --> 04:21:06.017
THAT SAID THEN I'M A LITTLE BIT

04:21:06.083 --> 04:21:07.985
WARY ABOUT CHANGING THINGS VERY

04:21:08.052 --> 04:21:10.688
MUCH.

04:21:10.755 --> 04:21:12.390
AND THE TO THAT DEGREE GIVING

04:21:12.456 --> 04:21:15.059
THE LEGISLATURE MORE DISCRETION.

04:21:15.126 --> 04:21:15.626
I'M USUALLY ONE THAT WOULD

04:21:15.693 --> 04:21:17.495
ADVOCATE THAT.

04:21:17.561 --> 04:21:19.063
BUT OVER THE DECADES ONE OF THE

04:21:19.130 --> 04:21:20.831
KEYS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE TRIAL

04:21:20.898 --> 04:21:22.066
COURT FUNDING IS PEOPLE COULD

04:21:22.133 --> 04:21:24.502
TRUST IT. IT WAS PREDICTABLE.

04:21:24.568 --> 04:21:26.470
I WOULD ASK HE SIMPLY AS WE

04:21:26.537 --> 04:21:31.976
PROCEED KEEP THEM FLOTSAM MIGHT.

04:21:32.043 --> 04:21:34.678
OKAY.

04:21:34.745 --> 04:21:43.888
IT'S A MOVE TO ISSUE SIX.

04:21:43.954 --> 04:21:45.423
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THIRTY FOUR

04:21:45.489 --> 04:21:46.557
OF YOUR HAND OUT.

04:21:46.624 --> 04:21:48.459
THE STATUS OF THE CURRENT

04:21:48.526 --> 04:21:49.693
STATUS OF THE TRIAL COURT

04:21:49.760 --> 04:21:50.961
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS THAT

04:21:51.028 --> 04:21:52.363
SIDE THAT CURRENT STATUS OF THE

04:21:52.430 --> 04:21:53.564
TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM

04:21:53.631 --> 04:21:54.965
IS THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY ON

04:21:55.032 --> 04:21:56.834
HOLES. IN THIS IS REALLY DUE TO

04:21:56.901 --> 04:21:58.569
THREE KEY PROBLEMS THAT ARE LAID

04:21:58.636 --> 04:21:59.804
OUT ON THIS PAGE.

04:21:59.870 --> 04:22:01.105
THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S

04:22:01.172 --> 04:22:02.039
BEEN A CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE

04:22:02.106 --> 04:22:07.578
FINAL FEW REVENUE THAT THE FACT THAT ABSENT ANY

04:22:07.645 --> 04:22:10.448
CHANGES IN REVENUES EXPENDITURES

04:22:10.514 --> 04:22:11.282
IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY COUNT HAVE

04:22:11.348 --> 04:22:13.417
INSUFFICIENT REVENUE TO SUPPORT.

04:22:13.484 --> 04:22:14.618
EXISTING DEBT SERVICE FOR THE

04:22:14.685 --> 04:22:15.786
TWENTY SIX PROJECTS THAT HAVE

04:22:15.853 --> 04:22:17.254
ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED AND THIS

04:22:17.321 --> 04:22:18.422
MAY REQUIRE GENERAL FUND

04:22:18.489 --> 04:22:19.890
RESOURCES RANGING FROM NINETY

04:22:19.957 --> 04:22:20.891
TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION

04:22:20.958 --> 04:22:22.293
DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR ABOUT

04:22:22.359 --> 04:22:23.661
FIFTEEN YEARS.

04:22:23.727 --> 04:22:25.763
AND FINALLY THERE'S NO LONG TERM

04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:27.198
PLAN FOR HOW WE'RE GONNA FIND.

04:22:27.264 --> 04:22:28.699
THE REMAINING A HUNDRED AND

04:22:28.766 --> 04:22:29.767
THIRTY NINE PLANS PROJECTS THAT

04:22:29.834 --> 04:22:30.601
WERE IDENTIFIED IN TWO THOUSAND

04:22:30.668 --> 04:22:32.236
AND EIGHT.

04:22:32.303 --> 04:22:33.571
THE NEXT TWO PAGES OF YOUR HAND
