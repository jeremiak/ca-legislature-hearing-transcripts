BRIAN RUTLEDGE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR LAYER PLEASURE TO BE HERE. SOLVE ALL BE BRIEF THIS MORNING I KNOW THERE'S SEVERAL BIG ISSUES YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE BIG CONTACTS THIS YEAR THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS YEARS IS THAT. ADMINISTRATION IS INTRODUCING A MULTI YEAR COMPACT WITH THE UC. SO THIS COMPACT WOULD LAST FROM. TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN THAT'S FIVE FISCAL YEARS. IT'S BASED. ARE YOU ON THE UC TWENTY THIRTY GOALS THAT THE SEGMENT HAD ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPING ITS BROADLY ALIGNED WITH THE CSU COMPACT IN THE CCC ROAD MAP AND ULTIMATELY WORKS TOWARDS GREATER ACCESS EQUITY AND AFFORDABILITY SECOND ARE COMING WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT YOU SEE WORKS ON. THE WHOLE SET OF EXPECTATIONS AND UNLIKE PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN- SEVERAL BIG EXPECTATIONS ON I CAN'T REALLY GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BECAUSE AS DETAILED IN THE EIGHT PAGES WE HAVE A LOT OF US SUBSTANTIAL EXPECTATIONS HERE THAT COME WITH THE COMPACT. ALL JUSTIFIED THE BIG CATEGORIES OF EXPECTATIONS SO WE HAVE EXPECTATIONS THAT FALL UNDER ACCESS EQUITY AFFORDABILITY INTERSEGMENT OF COORDINATION. WORKFORCE PREPAREDNESS AND ONLINE EDUCATION AND JUST A SINGLE OUT ONE CATEGORY THERE FOR SOME DETAILS THE ACCESS COMPONENT INCLUDES EXPECTATIONS AROUND ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THAT WOULD BE FULLY FUNDING THE UNDERGRADUATE GROWTH- SPECIFIED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT CREATING ANNUAL 1% GROWTH- SO ALL EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE OUTSIDE IN THE EIGHT PAGES UNDER THOSE CATEGORIES. THEY'RE TIED TO THE BIG PROPOSALS IN THE ACTUAL TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS YEAR WE HAVE- MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING PROPOSED- GENERAL FUND INCREASES FOR YOU SEE WE ALSO HAVE ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS. ALL LIST THE ON GOING AND ONE TIMES HERE. THE BIGGEST ONES OUR BIGGEST ONGOING GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION IS WE'RE PROPOSING IS TWO HUNDRED POINT FIVE MILLION I'LL BE FOR A 5% BASED AUGMENTATION. AND A TIE THIS TO THE MULTI YEAR AGREEMENT THE MULTI YEAR CONTACT. EACH YEAR DURING THE FIVE FISCAL YEARS THE PROPOSAL IS FOR A 5% BASED AUGMENTATION THIS TWENTY TO TWO HUNDRED POINT FIVE MILLION IS THE FIRST UNDER PROPOSED. SEVERAL YEARS OF SIMILAR AUGMENTATIONS. OUR CONTINGENT ON THE UC. MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE AGREED UPON GOALS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES SIXTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION THIRTY UNDERGRADUATE RESIDENT SLOTS THAT'S PURSUANT TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACTS WERE ESSENTIALLY PROPOSING TO FULLY FUND WHAT WAS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUDGET ACTED INTENT LANGUAGE WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING- THIRTY ONE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. TO FUND A NON RESIDENT- REVENUE BACK FILL BECAUSE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED EXPECTATIONS ABOUT REDUCING NONRESIDENT. ENROLLMENT OR AT LEAST THE PROPORTION. WORK WHAT WE'RE FOR FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAMS THERE WAS THERE ARE PARALLEL INVESTMENTS IN THE CSU IN C. SIXTIES AS WELL- FASTER YOU. WE'RE PROPOSING TO MILLION FOR FIREARMS RESEARCH AT UC DAVIS. AND WE'RE PROPOSING A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO THE GME OF THE GRADUATE PROGRAM BACK FILL TO KEEP THE PROGRAM AT FORTY MILLION TOTAL RESOURCES FOR YOU SEE. WE HAVE THREE ONE TIME PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE BIGGEST IS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION FOR THREE CLIMATE INVESTMENTS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE ENTIRE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ACROSS MANY POLICY AREAS THERE'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF VARIOUS INVESTMENTS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON. MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE. ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEN ALSO CREATING ECONOMIC INCLUSION AND GROWTH VIA THOSE PROPOSALS SO THIS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION WE'RE PROPOSING FOR YOU SEE PART OF A MUCH BROADER PACKAGE- THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THOUGHT THROUGH. THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE IS MADE UP OF A HUNDRED MILLION FOR A SEATING MATCHING GRANT. PROGRAM THAT WOULD THAT WOULD CREATE NEW APPLIED CLIMATE FOCUSED RESEARCH FIFTY MILLION FOR REGIONAL INCUBATORS TO DRIVE CLIMATE FOCUSED ENTREPRENEURSHIP. AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TRAINING HUBS AND THOSE WOULD BE COLOCATED WITH THE INCUBATORS FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP. SO THE OTHER TWO ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSED FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AND TEN MILLION FOR DYSLEXIA RESEARCH AT UCSF. WHICH BUILDS ARE. INVESTMENTS THE STATE HAS MADE. SO I WILL I WILL IN THERE AND I WE'RE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTRUST LEDGE. OF AND WE'RE HOLD ALL QUESTIONS TILL ALL THREE PANELISTS OF SPOKEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. HI GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE JASON KAHN CENTER LOS LA- YOUR FIRST ISSUE HERE IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT- FIRST PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR- WHICH IS AT 5% BASED INCREASED AMOUNTING TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OUR FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THAT SPECIFIC PROPOSAL- YOU'LL HE'LL- SOME OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS AND SUBSEQUENT ITEMS AND ALSO AND- THAT'S WHAT HEARING. I SPEECH FOR YOUR AGENDA NOTES. IN ADDITION TO THE PROPOSED GENERAL FUND BASED AUGMENTATION YOU SEE ALSO EXPECTS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING- FROM ITS PLAN TO INCREASE STUDENT TUITION INCREASED AND TUITION COMBINED WOULD AMOUNT TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION THE NEW BASE SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. PAGE SIX OF YOUR AGENDA SUMMARIZES OUR- ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATIONS. ARE KEY RECOMMENDATION HERE IS OF THE LEGISLATURE TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO BUDGETING FOR YOU SEE THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER. WITH THE SPECIFIC COST INCREASES IN PRIORITIES THAT WOULD LIKE TO FUND ANTI AUGMENTATIONS TO THOSE- ESTIMATED INCREASES. RATHER THAN ADOPTING ARBITRARY INCREASE WE THINK THAT APPROACH. WOULD OFFER MORE TRANSPARENCY INTO THE LEGISLATURE GREATER CONFIDENCE AS TO WHAT IT SPECIFICALLY FUNDING. WOULD ALSO THINK IT WOULD JUST LINE FOR MORE RATIONAL BUDGET DISCUSSION DECIDING BASED INCREASES WITH UC'S OPERATING COSTS- YOU SEE HAS WHAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SOME VERY BASIC OPERATING COST INCREASES. BUT IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH FUNDING IT GETS THESE ARE THINGS LIKE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COST INCREASES INCREASES TO ITS OPERATING EXPENSES AND EQUIPMENT. BY DEBT SERVICE COST INCREASES AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT THE UNIVERSITY ALSO FEATURE FACES DECISIONS AROUND HOW MUCH YOU SUPPORT IN FACT AND- FOUNDRESSES FOR FACULTY AND STAFF. NO I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A HARD RECOMMENDATION ON THE EXACT BASED INCREASED PROVIDE YOU SEE IN. THE BUDGET YEAR THAT'S NOT REALLY FALL ON THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES FOR YOU SEE AND THE SPECIFIC COST INCREASES WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT. ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT. IT A LITTLE LEGISLATURE AFTER LOOKING AT UC'S COST INCREASES. WE MIGHT LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BASE AUGMENTATION WHICH WE ESTIMATE WOULD COVER A UC'S BASIC OPERATING COST INCREASES AND CLOSE TO A 4% INCREASE AT ITS- ALWAYS SELL RIPPLE. I THINK THAT AUGMENTATION IS REASONABLE OUR POINT IS THAT OF THOSE COSTS SHOULD BE DRIVING THE DECISIONS NOT SOME ARBITRARY PERCENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED CAUTIOUS ABOUT. COMMITTING TO FUTURE ARBITRARY INCREASES AND CONTINUE TO REVIEW INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE WAY IT'S PRIORITIES EACH YEAR AND ASSESS ITS BUDGET SITUATION SURE WHEN DECIDING HOW MUCH FUNDING TO PROVIDE YOU SEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOULD NOW WILL MOVE ON TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING CHIRLA OR THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. I'M SAY EVER TALENT REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S THANKFUL TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM BURKE THE SUBSTANTIAL BUDGET INTRODUCTION. THE PROPOSED 5% ANNUAL BASE BUDGET INCREASES FOR FIVE YEARS UNIVERSITY AS WE UNDERTAKE IMPORTANT AN AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR ACCESS EQUITY AND AFFORDABILITY HAS HAD WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR IN RECENT YEARS HAS ALLOWED US TO ENROLL THOUSANDS OF NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CONDUCT RESEARCH ON ISSUES IMPACTING THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE. FROM AGRICULTURE TO HEALTH THE CHILDREN'S LEARNING LOSS. THESE ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR CHOSE TO INVEST IN HIGHER EDUCATION WE ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE THIS PARTNERSHIP AND SUPPORTING OUR SHARED GOALS FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S EXCELLENCE. WE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH A YEARS OUR FACULTY AND STUDENTS HAVE ADJUSTED TO CHANGING INSTRUCTIONAL MODALITIES AND OUR STAFF HAVE KEPT THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS AND SERVICES GOING STRONG. OUR MEDICAL CENTERS HAVE TENDED TO PATIENTS PROVIDED VACCINES AND CONDUCTED RESEARCH ON CODE AND ITS IMPACT. THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY HAS RESPONDED ADMIRABLY AND CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TO CALIFORNIA. THE STATE'S FISCAL AND POLICY CONTRIBUTIONS THE UNIVERSITY HELPED THIS FLEXIBILITY DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AS THE THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE WITH AN ESTIMATED TOTAL BUDGET OF FORTY FOUR BILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICES THAT TOUCH ON THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TODAY I WILL DISCUSS OUR CORE FUNDS BUDGET WITH YOU. THIS IS THE COMPONENT OF THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET THAT FUNDS ARE CAMPUS OPERATIONS INCLUDING ANSWER. AND IS COMPOSED OF GENERAL. TUITION FEES NONRESIDENTS TUITION AND A FEW SMALLER FUNDS. THE CORE FUNDS BUDGET FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS ESTIMATED AT TEN POINT FIVE BILLION. FOR BILLION OF THIS CORE OPERATING BUDGET IS PROVIDED AS ONGOING STATE GENERAL FUNDS. ANOTHER ONE BILLION COMES IN DIRECTLY FROM THE STATE IN THE FORM OF CAL GRANTS AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIPS TO COVER STUDENTS TUITION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FOUR POINT THREE BILLION AN ONGOING STATE GENERAL FUND AND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION AND ONE TIMES FUNDS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. FOR TOTAL BUDGET OF FOUR POINT SIX BILLION. THE PROPOSED 5% BASED BUDGET INCREASE WOULD PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY WITH TWO HUNDRED POINT FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. ASSISTING CAMPUS OPERATIONS AND HELP THE UNIVERSITY UNDERTAKE POLICY GOALS FOR ACCESS EQUITY AFFORDABILITY AND COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CSU INCREASES THAT THE UNIVERSITY FACES INCLUDE CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED REPRESENTED LABOR SALARY INCREASES DEBT SERVICE ON OUR BUILDINGS FACULTY HIM POLICY COVERED STAFF SALARY INCREASES AND GENERAL OPERATING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES. THE PROPOSED BASED BUDGET INCREASES FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS COUPLED WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S COURT BASED TUITION ADJUSTMENTS WILL PROVIDE TO UNIVERSITY WITH RESEARCH STABILITY TO GROW ENROLLMENT RESPONSIBLY. MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS ON CLOSING GRADUATION GAPS AND BEGIN OFFERING DEBT FREE EDUCATION OPTIONS. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE A COURT BASED TUITION AND FEES ARE ESTIMATED TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL FORTY FIVE MILLION IN OPERATING REVENUE AND THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION IN FINANCIAL AID. RECOGNIZING THAT ACCESS MUST BE PARTNERED WITH SUCCESS THE RETURNS HAVE SET A GOAL AND OUTLINED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES FOR CLOSING GRADUATION GAPS. WHILE THE CURRENT FOR YOUR OVERALL GRADUATION RATE IS SEVENTY TWO POINT 6% THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS IS SIXTY TWO POINT THREE PERCENT. THE UNIVERSITY WANTS TO ENHANCE STUDENT ACADEMIC PREPARATION ADVISING AND TUTORING BOLSTER ANALYTICAL TOOLS TO ALLOW FOR EARLY ACADEMIC INTERVENTION. AND SUPPORT ANIMATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONAL DELIVERY AS METHODS FOR CLOSING THIS GRADUATION CAP. IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LEGISLATURE DEVELOP NEW FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS TO REDUCE THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS. UNIVERSITY SHARES THIS BOWL OF BAK FREE EDUCATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. PRESIDENT DRAKE HAS DISCUSSED HIS INTENT TO MOVE TOWARD STEP FREE EDUCATION AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF STATE AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS WE WILL BEGIN MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS GOAL. AS STATE INVESTMENTS AND FINANCIAL AID GROW SO WILL OUR PROGRAMS TO OFFER ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO OUR STUDENTS. THESE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS COMBINED WITH THE STABILITY PROVIDED BY THE UNIVERSITY'S COHORT BASED TUITION WILL PROVIDE ASSURANCE TO OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT THEY CAN AFFORD HIGHER EDUCATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO ESTABLISHES GOALS FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CSU. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN INCREASING INTER SEGMENTAL COLLABORATION IN RECENT YEARS WITH TWENTY ONE ESTABLISHED TRANSFER PATHWAYS FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE UC STUDENT ACADEMIC PREPARATION AN EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS TO PREPARE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO CSU OR UC. AND WORKING WITH PARTNERS STATE AGENCIES ON THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE CRADLE TO CAREER SYSTEM. THE COLLABORATION GOALS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCREASE THESE COLLABORATIONS AND LEVERAGE THE STRENGTHS OF EACH PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENT. WITH THE SHARED GOALS IN MIND THE UNIVERSITY REQUEST FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BASE BUDGET INCREASE OF MUCH OUR WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS IN A AND I NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT SENATOR MAN. CANNOT BE WITH US AND HE GAVE ME A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO ASK ON THIS ITEM BUT A THIS IS PROBABLY THE BROAD OVERVIEW AND THIS IS A PLACE WHERE MANY THINGS FALL THEREFORE THEY'LL BE MANY QUESTIONS. AND LET ME BEGIN BY ASKING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN YOUR PRESENTATION HE GAVE A BROAD BRUSH OVERVIEW. OF A COMPACT THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING CONDITION FOR THE 5% OF BASE INCREASE THAT YOU ARE ALSO INCLUDING IN YOUR BUDGET. ARE YOU GAVE AN OVERVIEW WHEN WILL THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE COMPACT BE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- AS I AS I MENTIONED THERE'S RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A AGREED UPON FRAMEWORK SO WE DO HAVE THE ACTUAL HIGH LEVEL GOALS AGREED UPON. WHAT WE ARE WORKING THROUGH NOW AND YOU CAN EXPECT IT MAY REVISE OUR SOME DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO MEASURE AND- THEREFORE HOW DAY HOW OLD TYPICALLY TO IMPLEMENT THESE- AGREED UPON GOALS OF THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY NEXT QUESTION SO RIGHT NOW. THERE'S NO MEASUREMENT AND THERE'S NO. POUND ABILITY MECHANISM- BECAUSE I THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS. IS IF THEY DO NOT MEET THE GOALS THAT THAT THAT YOU BOTH AGREE TO IN THE FRAMEWORK HOW WOULD IT BE A FORCED. ALSO WE'RE WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT FOR THE MAY REVISED UP. OKAY THEN LET ME ASK ONE OTHER QUESTION ON THAT. DID I HEAR YOU SAY THAT IT WAS ALSO PREDICATED ON NO TUITION INCREASES FROM. NO NO SIR D. THE- FURTHER UC'S COMPACT DISCS THE COHORT BASED TUITION UC HAD INDEPENDENTLY ADOPTED- LAST YEAR AND IT TO BEGIN IN BUDGET YEAR. I THAT THAT IS PART OF THE CONTACT THE PREMISE IS THAT DAY ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT- AND THE RESOURCES THEY WOULD GAIN FROM THAT I WOULD HELP ACHIEVE ALL THE AGREED UPON EXPECTATIONS THERE IS NOT A- I HAD TO WISHIN HIATUS. OF PRESUME BY- HOW THE CONTRA OF CONTACT WOULD BE AGREED TO THAT'S CORRECT YOU SEE IS NOT UP TO DATE- A COHORT BASED MODEL THAT THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY RISE WITH INFLATION. AND THEN- LET ME JUST MAKE A COMMENT BECAUSE- WE'RE EXPECTED TO APPROPRIATE MONEY BASED ON THE COMPACT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE SPECIFICS OF THE COMPACT ACTUALLY AS THEY ARE GOING TO BE LAID OUT AN AGREED TO. AND I THINK WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ADHERE TO WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS SAID OR ANYONE ELSE WITH REGARD TO OR RIGHT TO APPROPRIATE UNTIL WE HAVE SEEN THE SPECIFICS OF THE COMPACT AND I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT CLEAR I DON'T WANT TO BE ANY SURPRISE. A AND IT WILL BE CONCERNING IF IT JUST COMES OUT IN A MAY REVISE AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ACT IN A MATTER OF DAYS AND THERE STILL A LACK OF. THE SOME SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. WE WANT TO KNOW WE WANT CLARITY ARE WE DON'T WANT TO ACT ON THE APPROPRIATION AND TELL THAT EXISTS IN SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT REALLY CLEAR FOR IT IN THE PROCESS AND- THERE IS ALSO LOTS OF CONVERSATION OUT THERE. AS IF THIS IS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION AND IT MAY WELL BE SOMETHING THAT WE AGREE WITH BUT WE WANT TO SEE IT BEFORE WE AGREE AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SHOULD ASSUME THAT IT IS AUTOMATICALLY BEEN AGREED TO AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL UNTIL. WE CAN HAVE THE COMPLETE DETAILS- SO I JUST TO DO THAT AND THEN- IT LET ME ASK YOU SEE- IT. A. N. THIS ACTUALLY GOES TO ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S MADE IT SEEMS TO BE THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE HAPPY THAT THERE'S A 5% OUT THE GATE. OUR BASE INCREASE AND YET GIVEN INFLATION AND INCREASE COSTS- I'M NOT SURE 5% MEETS THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE SAID AT UC AND SO LET ME ASK YU SEE. HOW YOU WOULD MEASURE THAT. AND WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD NEED JUST TO MOVE AHEAD AT THE SAME LEVEL OF. OPERATIONS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER LAYERED- THE UC REGENTS DID REQUEST A BASE BUDGET INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS HOWEVER WE THINK THAT WITH THE COLD HARD BASED TUITION INCREASED AND COST CONTAINMENT INTERNALLY AND FEATURE WITH OUR OWN BUDGET WE CAN. WE ARE BASE BUDGET AND NAY AND MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON THESE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED BY THE GOVERNOR INDIA EIGHT PAGES AND EXCUSE ME FOR BEING A STICKLER BUT NOTHING MAKES ME CRAZIER THAN THE PROPOSAL BEING AND PERCENTAGES AND THEN YOUR RESPONSE BEING AND DOLLARS. FIND UNDER. HOW THOSE SMASH PARDON ME SIR THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WILL ONE MILLION DOLLARS REPRESENTS ABOUT SIX POINT 3% INCREASE WE ARE WE'RE NOT REQUESTING THAT AT THIS TIME WE ARE REQUESTING A 5% INCREASE FOR THE UNIVERSITY SPOKE SPANISH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THE OTHER. A SOURCES OF REVENUE HELP YOU MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE TO GET THROUGH THIS BUDGET YEAR IS THAT WAS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAYING MORTEMART PARSING YOUR WORDS. THAT IS WHAT I WAS SAYING SIR THAT WITH THE COVERT BASS TUITION INCREASE AND- WHAT IS CERTAIN INVESTMENTS INTERNALLY AND- WATCHING OUR OWN BUDGETS WE THINK WE CAN MEET OUR NEEDS. EIGHT AND THEN. ANOTHER QUESTION- HAS TO DO WITH NON RESIDENT TUITION AND LAST YEAR THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT- TO ACT CAP. OVERTIME AT 18% FOR UNDERGRADUATE NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT TO ALLOW FOR MORE SPACES FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. AND I THINK THE STATISTICS JUST FOR THE RECORD ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE PART OF MY QUESTION. IS IT UC BERKELEY AS A TWENTY FOUR POINT 4% UC IRVINE AT EIGHTEEN POINT 5% UCLA TWENTY TWO POINT SIX PERCENT. IN SAN DIEGO IT TWENTY TWO POINT 5% ARE WAS GONNA ASK HER. AND WE JUST ADOPTED THAT IN THE BUDGET LAST JUNE WHAT THE PROGRESSES TOWARD THAT BUT- I UNDERSTAND. THAT TO THE CAMPUSES DID NOT MEET THE NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT CAP THAT WAS SET UP FOR FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THAT PRESIDENT DRAKE IS PLANNING ON. THE WORD WAS PROVIDED TO ME PENALIZING I DON'T WANNA THROW SOMEBODY IN THE DOCK BUT THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME ACTIONS TAKEN FOR THE TWO- THAT THAT DID NOT COMPLY THAT INVOLVES. DEALING WITH THE MONEY THAT THAT IS INVOLVED THERE SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD UPDATE. THE COMMITTEE ON WHAT THE PROGRESSES TOWARD THE AGREEMENT AND DESCRIBED WHAT THE SITUATION IS WITH REGARD TO PRESIDENT DIRECTS DIRECTION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE PERCENTAGES THAT YOU READ REPRESENTING YOU DO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REGENTS CAP ON NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT AT THOSE SPECIFIC CAMPUSES. UP FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE- A FEW THREE CAMPUSES DID EXCEED THEIR CAPS UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STAY WITHIN THE REGION'S CAP. AND THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT WANT TO- CREATE ANY INCENTIVE FOR THESE CAMPUSES TO COPE OVER TAX CAP. PRESIDENT DRAKE HAS MADE THE DECISION THAT HE WILL REMOVE ALL OF THE NONRESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION ABOVE THE CAP FROM THOSE CAMPUSES THAT WENT OVER TO CAP I'M PROVIDED TWO CAMPUSES THAT HAVE FEWER RESOURCES PER STUDENT TO USE AS ONE TIME REVENUE- THOSE CAMPUSES THAT WILL RECEIVE THE FUNS ARE. UC SANTA CRUZ UC MERCED UC RIVERSIDE AND THE TOTAL ALLOCATION BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM OUR LA SAN DIEGO AND IRVINE IS ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN WHAT YES A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. THERE'S SOME SITUATION AND I NEVER REMEMBER WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED. WHERE THERE ARE THREE CAMPUSES THAT WERE SORT OF UNDER RESOURCE TO HISTORICALLY COMPARED TO OTHER CAMPUSES AND AT THAT PRESIDENT DRACO SAID AS A LONG TERM GOAL TO REDRESS THAT. INEQUITY TO THOSE HAPPEN TO BE THE THREE CAMPUSES TO WHICH THIS MORNING WAS JUST DIRECTED TO. THAT THAT IS CORRECT SO- WHILE OUR CAMPUSES ALL RECEIVE THE SAME DOLLARS PER STUDENT UNDER OUR RETENTION FORMULA. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT MIX OF STUDENTS AND GRADUATE STUDENT MEDICAL STUDENTS AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY NEEDED FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EDUCATION VARIES. SO SOME OTHER CAMPUSES- THAT JOINT DON'T IN MORE DOLLARS FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY RECEIVED HELPS A LITTLE BIT LESS. PER STUDENT ON THE WHOLE ON THE AVERAGE ACROSS STOCK FORMULA. WE HAVE NOW TAKEN STEPS TO CORRECT THAT. WHERE TO REAP BENCHING FORMULA OUR HUSBAND WHERE REWRITING IT TO- STATE THAT NO CAMPUS WILL GET LESS THAN 95% OF THE- AVERAGE FOR THE CAMPUS DOES. SO THIS SHOULD BEGIN CORRECTING SOME OF THOSE HISTORICAL- BUILT IN. BOB INEC THERE ISN'T IT NEVER ASSUME OF- HOT STUDENTS THAT WE WERE WAITING AS- HAS BEEN AND IF I ASK YOU THIS QUESTION HOPEFULLY BY THE THIRD YEAR I WILL REMEMBER WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS PROGRAM. HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE THIS WHEN YOU'RE TO LOOK AT THESE BEING ADDRESSED YEAH WE CALL IT OUR RETENTION PROGRAM OKAY RETENTION. I'M SURE IS THERE SOME. SPORTS POND TO BE MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT BUT THE THREE ARE JUST COINCIDENTALLY OR THREE THAT DON'T HAVE A MEDICAL FACILITIES RIGHT OR- IS THAT ONE OF THE DISTINCTIONS THAT CAUSES FOR THE DIFFERENCE. BUT THAT THAT IS CORRECT CENTER LAYERED WHILE UC RIVERSIDE NOW HAS A MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT IS A RELATIVELY RECENT ADDITION TO THAT CAMPUS- AND UC SANTA CRUZ AND UC MERCED DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE MEDICAL SCHOOLS- AND THEN- DOES THAT MEAN THAT. IF THE CAMPUSES IN QUESTION THAT WERE OVER THE CAP THIS YEAR ARE OVER THE CAP NEXT YEAR THERE WILL BE SOME SIMILAR THING THAT HAPPENS THAT THAT'S THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT THE PRESIDENT IS USING AGAINST CAMPUSES THAT THE DUMP ME TO CAP PRESIDENT DRAKE- FOR NEXT YEAR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO- UCLA AND UC SAN DIEGO WE NEED TO REDUCE THE LOAD THE REGION'S TOP FIVE THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS WILL SPEAK ABOUT THAT IN THE NEXT ITEM. IN SOME MORE DETAIL I KNOW THE NEXT I'D MISS IN ROMA TO. PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE A DEFERRED TILL THEN AND THEN LET ME ASK ABOUT ONE OF OUR FAVORITE TOPICS BUXBAUM- THE SUBJECT OF CONTRACTING OUT IN THE LETTER WAS PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE. DATED A JANUARY THIRTY FIRST THAT IS A REPORT. BUDGET BEFORE LAST AND IT WITH US FOR INSTANCES IN WHICH- THERE WAS SOME SPECIAL CONTRACTING OUT THAT NEEDED TO BE CALLED OUT. AND IF THOSE FOR INSTANCES ALL HAPPENED IN THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR BUT THE LETTER DOESN'T GIVE A FULLER PICTURE OF WHAT DID HAPPEN UNDER THE AGREEMENT IT JUST CALLS OUT THESEFOR- COULD YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE DOOR CHARACTERIZATION OF HOW. SUCCESSFUL THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN IN- IMPLEMENTING- THE LANGUAGE THAT CAME IN TWENTY TWENTY WITH REGARD TO THE SUBJECT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY REQUIRED THAT FOR THOSE BUILDINGS THAT RECEIVE STATE GENERAL FUND FOR A CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT ONCE THAT PROJECT IS COMPLETE THE UNIVERSITY WOULD CERTIFY ON THAT BUILDING GOING BACK TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY CONTRACTS- FOR OUTSIDE WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY- NON UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES FOR WORK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE TRADITIONALLY PERFORMED BY ASKS ME AS SEX BARGAINING UNIT. AND WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON THOSE- ARE THOSE INSTANCES THAT HAVE OCCURRED AS NEW BUILDINGS HAVE COME ONLINE THE KEY UNDER THE S. B. EIGHT TWENTY RUBRIC- AND WE HAVE BEEN AS THOSE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN COMING ONLINE WE HAVE BEEN ELIMINATING OUR FUTURE CONTRACTS IN THOSE BUILDINGS. SO IN THE MOST RECENT REPORT THAT YOU SAW THE FOR EXCEPTIONS- TWO OF THEM ARE ON TRACK TO BE ELIMINATED ONE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNNECESSARY REPORTING TO BE CAN WEST AND THE OTHER WE ARE EXAMINING THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE EXCEPTIONS CURRENTLY. AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE SOMEPLACE THAT IT'S POSTED. ARE WHAT YOU MENTIONED WITH THE GENERAL COMPLIANCE THAT EXIST SOMEWHERE THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS. THERE REQUIREMENTS REMEASUREMENT ONLY THE EXCEPTIONS BE REPORTED. YES SO THEIR STATUTE REQUIRES THAT ONLY BE EXCEPTIONS ARE REPORTED PASS UNDER A CHOI BOGUE AND FENNEL ASSESS WEST WHETHER SENATOR MEANS TO QUESTIONS ON THIS I HAVE BEEN ASKED WHEN SHE'S DONE SENATOR OCHO BOOK- SENATOR. THERE'D THIS WAS WITH THE TO OF. WHAT IS THE REASON FOR PROVIDING THE UC UNRESTRICTED BASE GROWTH GIVEN THE L. A. O.'S COMMENT THAT THEY BELIEVE IT IS A POOR APPROACH TO BUDGETING FOR OPERATING COST. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER. SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS- THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS- THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN THIS APPROACH IN THE PAST BUDGET ACT PROVIDED A 5% FLEXIBLE BASE AUGMENTATION. I WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE POINT TWO LAST YEAR WE'RE PROPOSING A TWO HUNDRED POINT FIVE VERSION OF THAT THIS YEAR AS THE- FIRST OF SEVERAL SO IN OUR VIEW IT'S A CONTINUATION UP APPROVING PRACTICE THAT THE STATE HAS USED. AB ALL I WILL JUST KNOW THAT ON THE PERSPECTIVE THAT IT'S ARBITRARY WE JUST DON'T WE DON'T SHARE THAT PERSPECTIVE FROM THE STATE'S VIEW THERE'S- THERE'S AVAILABLE RESOURCES SO WE CAN'T ALWAYS THINK ABOUT BUDGETS ONE TO ONE DOWN THE LINE BUT FROM A UC BUDGETING PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE UC TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS THAT'S PART OF NEGOTIATING THE CONTRACT OR THE- MULTI YEAR COMPACT. AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE BIGGEST ONE FROM OUR VIEW THAT I THINK WE HAVE TYPICALLY HAD A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE L. L. IS THAT FLEXIBILITY IS THE BEST WAY WE BELIEVE FOR THE UC TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FOR THIS THIS TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET ACT OR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO THE MULTI YEAR COMPACT AND IN GENERAL THAT'S THAT'S WORKED IN THE PAST WHERE- NOT A ONE TO ONE. WE DON'T WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TIE THE HANDS OF YOU SEE TO SAY. X. WAS WITH WITH THESE EGGS AMOUNTS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT AS KOBE DEMONSTRATED THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE SHIPPED AROUND YEAR TO YEAR. OKAY WITH THE L. A- LIKE TO RESPOND. SURE SO AS THE RESTORATION NOTES THIS HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING UP A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALSO THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION TO. ON THE STATE HISTORICALLY HAS PROVIDED- YOU KNOW BASICALLY SAYS BASED ON A CERTAIN PERCENT THAT WAS DECIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION SOME YEARS IT WAS FIVE PERCENT. SOME YEARS IT WAS FOUR PERCENT- I ACTUALLY WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FIGURE IN THEIR AGENDA- ON PAGE- FIVE FIGURE ONE THAT THAT JUST THAT'S SOME RISE ALL THE BASE INCREASES. THERE WAS ONE YEAR WHERE THE STATE DID INCREASES THAT WAS IN NINETEEN TWENTY SO THE STATE HAS DONE THAT BEFORE THAT THAT SEEM TO WORK WELL- THE STATED THAT. UNDER FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN AGAIN IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HAS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION WHEN IT TEXAS BASED INCREASE APPROACH AS TO WHAT SPECIFICALLY SUPPORTING. AND THIS IS IN PART BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T- YOU KNOW. ALL HER BUDGET PLAN UNTIL OUT THE AND ACTED. THE LEGISLATURE REALLY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING FOR COST INCREASES WHAT IS GOING FOR SALARY INCREASES- IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS SPECIFIC PRIORITIES LIKE IT WANTS TO SUPPORT CERTAIN STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES THAT HAS. VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE JUST. PROVIDING A BASE INCREASING THAT'S WHAT THE FUNDING IS BEING USED FOR. THAT'S WHY WE THINK TYING IT TO SPECIFIC COST INCREASES OF A MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH- WE CAN HEARD WITH THE MISTER. THAT THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS ON THE STATE'S BUDGET SITUATIONS DIFFERENT EVERY YEAR IT'S REASONABLE THAT THE STATE WOULD- YOU KNOW REVISIT HOW MUCH FUNDING IT HAS AVAILABLE FOR ON GOING BASE INCREASES THAT YOU SEE EACH YEAR REASON WHY WE WOULD CAUTION AGAINST- COMMITTING IT TOO FAR IN THE FUTURE TO THE SORT OF ARBITRARY BASE INCREASES- HAD THAT STATE TAKEN THAT APPROACH TWO YEARS AGO- IT WOULD NOT HAVE INSTEAD OF THE PANDEMIC WOULD HAVE HAD TO REACT ON THAT PRETTY QUICKLY- AND- AND REDUCE UC'S BUDGET. I'M SO WE DO THINK THAT THE BUDGET SITUATION IS SOMETHING LEGISLATURE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE LEGISLATURE NONETHELESS FROM UNDERSTANDING UC'S. COST DRIVERS ARE TRYING TO. TIE ITS- FUNDING AUGMENTATIONS TO THE SPECIFIC COST DRIVERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- SO JUST SO THAT I AM CLEAR SEE IT IS A IT'S A 5% INCREASE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS A YEAR FIVE YEAR PER YEAR. FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS YES THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING AND THE L. A. ALWAYS HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT COMMITTING. THAT FUNDING. FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. I THINK THE- THE THIS IS US- ARE YOU PUTTING WORDS IN THE MOUTH OF FINANCE AND NOW ME PUTTING WORDS IN THE MOUTH OF THE ALLEY- BUT I THINK THAT THERE. ARE IT'S NOT THAT THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH PUTTING THE RESOURCES TO LEGISLATIVE ANALYST IT'S JUST THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT A NUMBER THAT YOU SHOULD TURN IT TO SPECIFIC EXPENSES OR NEEDS. AND CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND- ARE THERE ANY CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THAT. THAT COMMITMENT. WELL ACTUALLY LET'S DIRECT THAT THE A. I. I'M ACTUALLY HAVING A GREAT TIME RESPONDING FOR FINANCING THE L. A. OPENED A I THINK LET'S LET. OF FINANCE RESPOND TO THAT. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I DO APPRECIATE IT- SURE LAYERED- THE PRE ANSWER NO FROM FINANCES PERSPECTIVE THE MINISTRATION CONSIDER THE 5% THE RIGHT. THE RIGHT AMOUNT BECAUSE WE WERE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT LOOKING AT THE OUT YEARS- AND- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT SOMETHING LIKE A COVE IT IS- YOU KNOW THERE'S ECONOMIC SHOCKS THAT. CAN RESTRUCTURE THINGS BUT- THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT AT GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW AND GIVEN THE STATE'S AVAILABLE RESOURCES WE STRUCTURE THE BUDGET IN A WAY THAT'S NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE UC RISEN OVERALL FISCAL. SUSTAINABILITY ARCHITECTURE THIS ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN VERY LASER FOCUSED ON. AND SO DOES THIS 5% FOR US IS WHAT WE SEE AS THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES- THAT WE COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE UC. AND THAT WE COULD ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE AGREED UPON WITH THE UC TOWARDS TOWARDS WORKING ON. IN THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND- GO AHEAD MR CONTENT TO OTHERS FROM THE HELLO- I ALSO WANTED JUST A CLEAR FIVE POINT TO JUST HAVE- MAKE SURE YOU KNOW AS YOU'RE WEIGHING YOUR OPTIONS HERE- YOU KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THE LITERAL COMPOSABLE FOR YOU IS A FIVE PERCENT. INCREASE IN THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED A COMPACT A MULTI YEAR CONTRACT THAT WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT BUT A DOCTOR THE INCREASE THIS YEAR DOES THAT- NECESSARILY COMMIT THE LEGISLATURE TO THOSE INCREASES IN THE FUTURE. SO EACH YEAR THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONTINUE TO REVISIT THE CONTACT- AND- I JUST FUNDING ACCORDINGLY SO IT DOES IT'S NOT LIKE IF YOU WERE JUST AN INCREASE THIS YEAR YOU'VE YOU'VE COMMITTED DOWN THE ROAD. LEGISLATURE STILL HAS SOME. DISCRETION I THINK OUR POINT IS JUST WANT TO COST THE LEGISLATURE AGAINST FOR COMMITTING TO IT- AGAIN IT'S GONNA IT'S- POSSIBILITY TO REVISIT THINGS AND YOU. YEARS AS COST PRESSURES CHANGE. AND I THINK THIS IS WHERE I WOULD MAKE A COMMENT A- IN THAT IS AS I RECALL BEING RESOURCES SECRETARY AND- US SITTING IN THE CHAIR- BASS HAVING THEM ASK ME ABOUT A HUNDRED. I THINK IT WAS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT EVERY YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS OR FIVE HUNDRED FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND IT MAY BE RESPONDING THAT I LOOKED UP AT THE COMMITTEE AND I ONLY SAW ONE LEGISLATOR THAT'D BEEN THERE IN BAD ECONOMIC TIMES. AND THAT WHEN YOU COMMIT 45% A YEAR OVER FIVE YEARS. IF WE JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WAS EVEN HALFWAY TOWARD THE GREAT RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN AND ELEVEN IT WOULD SEVERELY IMPACT THE STATE'S ABILITYTO MAKE GOOD ON THAT 5% A YEAR AND I THINK. I'M JUST PUTTING A FINER POINT ON WHAT DELAY- JUST SAID BECAUSE IT REALLY IS SUBJECT TO IT YOU KNOW BEFORE THE- ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WE WERE IN THE LARGEST CONTINUOUS PERIOD OF EXPANSION SINCE WORLD WAR TWO. HAND PEOPLE FORGOT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE THE TROUGHS OF IT GOING DOWN SO IF THERE'S A TROUGH IT GOING DOWN IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO BEAT UP 5% COMPARED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE IF YOU OF ANOTHER ONE YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT I THINK YOU'RE I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND MY POINT OF YOU KNOW I THINK YOU JUST ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE MOVING FORWARD YOU KNOW MAKING A COMMITMENT FIVE YEARS ON THE LINE- ON A GOOD YEAR. AS WE HAVE TO. THIS YEAR. JUST MAKES ME A BIT NERVOUS- AND I'VE AND I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THAT WE SHOULD- MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE OR REEVALUATE EVERY SINGLE YEAR- IN GOING BACK TO THE- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS A COMMENT THAT- WITH REGARDS TO. IT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST THAT IT HAS WORKED AND THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE DONE I'M JUST ALWAYS VERY CURIOUS ABOUT. I DON'T REALLY BUY INTO THAT MINDSET JUST BECAUSE WITH THAT IN THE PAST YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO IT I. I LOOK AT ALL OF YOUR FEEDBACK IN ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS AND I DO. NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE L. A. O.'S COMMENT THAT- THEY LIKE TO HAVE IT AB PRIORITY BASED APPROACH TO THE FINANCE SO- DEPARTMENT FINEST I DISAGREE ON THAT AND JUST BECAUSE IT OUT OF THE PAST AS I MEAN. YOU KNOW IF THE BEST PLAYER OF THE ULTIMATE WEIGHT TO DO IT IN THE FUTURE- BUT I DO BUT I DO RESPECT BOTH. PERSPECTIVE I JUST WANT TO SEE. SAID THIS RESPECTFULLY- DISAGREE. I MEAN RESPECTFULLY. DISAGREE THAT'S- RESEARCH DISAGREE ON THAT IN BUT- THANK YOU FOR YOUR- THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND SENATOR MAN LIFE TWO QUESTIONS THAT WERE IN THIS CATEGORY AND I'M GOING TO ASK THEM SEPARATELY AND I THINK SOME OF THE- OF THE ITEMS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED ALREADY YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO REFER YOURSELF TO PREVIOUS ANSWER. AND JUST ADD. BUT THE FIRST ONE IS A QUESTION FOR ANY WROTE THIS IN THE THIRD PERSON SO I'M KIND OF LIKING IT ON. ME HE SAYS HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED TUITION INCREASES THE BIG QUESTION THAT HE HAS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IS HOW THEY ARE WORKING TO CREATE A DEBT FREE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR STUDENTS WHEN AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE PLANNING TO OCEAN INCREASES AND SO ALL PUT THAT TO THE- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REGENTS VOTED TO TAKE INCREASES AND PUT THEM TOWARD FINANCIAL AID FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS SO BECAUSE OF THIS RETURN TO AID- WITH OUR PRIOR RETURN TRADE POLICIES WHILE THE UNIVERSITY IS ABLE TO OFFER SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR POOR STUDENTS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY DON'T SUFFER ADVERSE IMPACTS FROM ANY TUITION INCREASE. IN FACT THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE- TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE COHORT BASED TUITION INCREASE WILL GO TO FINANCIAL AID FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. THANK YOU RIGHT THAT AND THEN HIS SECOND QUESTION IS A GENERALLY HE'S SUPPORTIVE OF BASE INCREASES BUT WANTS TO ENSURE THAT BASE SPENDING GOES TOWARD SUPPORTING STUDENTS AND IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR EXAMPLE HOW DOES THIS BASE INCREASE AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO HIRE STAFF TO OFFER MORE COURSE OPERATE OFFERINGS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ADDITIONAL STUDENTS PARTICULARLY REDUCING THE TIME 2 DEGREES AND ALL HOME I THINK OF DIRECT THAT TO YOU SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE WISHES TO COMMENT THAT CAN. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TAKES THE- BASED BUDGET INCREASES PROVIDED BY THE STATE. AND WE POVIDED TO OUR CAMPUSES ON A PER STUDENT FORMULA THAT'S THE REPRINTING FORMULA WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. THE CHANCELLOR'S HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE FLEXIBILITY TO INVEST THOSE FUNDS ARE ON THEIR CAMPUS TO THE STUDENT SERVICES AND INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES THAT THEY MOST NEED TO FIND. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON- WE WANT SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THAT BASE BUDGET SO THAT WE CAN ALLOW OUR CHANCELLORS TO CHOOSE WHICH TYPES OF SERVICES THAT THEY WANT TO FIND ON THEIR CAMPUS THE MOST TOWARD BASE BUDGET COST INCREASES ON THE CAMPUSES RATHER THAN HIRING NEW STAFF OR SAY. THE 5% WILL GO TO SUPPORT EXISTING OPERATIONS AND SOME ENHANCEMENTS AND PROVIDING ADVISING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES TO TRY TO CLOSE THOSE GRADUATION GAPS. MUCH OF THE HIRING THAT WILL BE DONE WILL BE WITH THE NEW ENROLLMENT FUNDING THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING FOR THE UNIVERSITY THAT WILL DISCUSS AS PART THE NEXT ITEM. NINETY EIGHT MILLION THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET ME JUST ASK. AS WE GET READY TO MOVE TO THE NEXT ITEM WAS OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE L. A. OVER FINANCE WISHED TO ADD TO THE- THOSE TWO QUESTIONS. IF I MADE SURE JUST OUT OF A POINT UNDERLINED WITH THE UC OFFERED ON A SENATOR MEN'S QUESTION ABOUT BASING CREASES. AND STUDENT SUCCESS. OUR FROM OUR VIEW THE COMPACT HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A WAY WE'VE AGREED WITH THE UC ON. OUT FAIRLY AMBITIOUS GOALS TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES FOR EXAMPLE IN OTHER OUTCOMES THAT WILL DIRECTLY. BENEFIT STUDENTS IN TERMS OF WHAT IT COSTS TO GO TO COLLEGE HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN GET A DEGREE. ETCETERA AND SO THE BASING CREASES. IN OUR VIEW HAVE BEEN DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT'S GOING TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. THANK YOU THIS ELIO ANY. LAST WORDS BEFORE WE MOVE ON- WHAT WE'RE HAPPY TO WITH- STAFF IS NEEDED- THE SENATE ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE A SPECIFIC PRIORITIES THEY WANT TO ENSURE FUND BUDGET. YOU KNOW GENERALLY THE MOST DIRECT WAY THE LEGISLATURE CAN ENSURE FUNDS ARE SPENT ACCORDING TO ITS PRIORITIES IS TO SPECIFY THEM THE BUDGET- SOMETIMES A LEGISLATURE DOES GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE WHEN MEET YOU'LL HEAR THE NEXT ITEM- AND BOTTOM LINE GROWTH IN A LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST HAS GIVEN FUNDS FOR ROMAN GROWTH. OTHERS FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO COVER MORE FACULTY- YOU KNOW HIRE OTHER HIGHER COSTS THE STUDY ASSOCIATED WITH LOAN GROWTH. CAMPUSES AREN'T REQUIRED TO SPEND IT ON THOSE EXACT ACTIVITIES THEY THEY CAN ARE PRIORITIZE A LITTLE BIT AS THE SCENE AS THEY SEE FIT- BUT THAT'S WHAT IT IS IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC PRIORITIES USUALLY THE WAY TO DO THIS. BY THE BUDGET. OKAY YOU VERY MUCH N. THANK EVERYBODY. ON THAT PANEL THE- FOR WORK WITH US THE QUESTIONS AND WE'LL GO TO MOVE TO ISSUE TO IS RESIDENT AND NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT WHICH WE HAVE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT. AN AMAZINGLY IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME PANEL IN EXACTLY THE SAME QUARTER. SO ARE WE WILL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GO TO THE L. A. O. AND THEN TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. MISTER RUTTLEDGE WELCOME BACK TO THE COMPANY. THANKS SO MUCH CHAIR. SO ON UNDER ROMAN- JUST BRIEFLY RESTATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE INCLUDES SIXTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION. ONGOING THAT WOULD SUPPORT SIXTY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY. RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE SPOTS. AN INCREASE OF UP SIXTY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY- THAT IS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT THERE IS AN AGREEMENT. MADE THAT THAT WOULD BE THE NUMBER FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND IN ADDITION TO THOSE THERE'S ALSO THIRTY ONE MILLION. FOR YOUR SUPPORT- ESSENTIAL THE- SHIFTING OF COMPOSITION WHERE THERE'S A DECREASING PROPORTION OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN RESIDENTS STUDENTS. IN THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. BUDGET YEAR AND SO WE'VE WE'RE PROPOSING. FUNDING FOR- THE TOTAL IS OVER. SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED NEW UNDERGRADUATES. OKAY THANK YOU LMAO. SO THIS ITEM IS A BIT MORE COMPLICATED AND- PASSING MOMENT ISSUES YOU REALLY HAVE TO- ITEMS EMBEDDED IN THIS ISSUE OTHER FIRST IS IMPLEMENTING EXPECTATIONS THAT WERE SET IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ABOUT ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND THE SECOND ISSUE IS LOOKING AHEAD INTO THE FUTURE FOR A MOMENT SO I'LL TOUCH ON EACH ISSUE SEPARATELY. OUR FIRST ON THE FIRST ISSUE IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING PAST AGREEMENTS JUST WANT TO REITERATE- WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION INTRODUCED THE MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A TOTAL INCREASE OF NINETY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A TOTAL RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO STUDENTS THAT INCLUDE SOME- BASED WOMAN GROWTH THAT WAS EXPECTED A MASTER'S BUDGET. PLUS ADDITIONAL GROWTH ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON RESIDENT REPLACEMENT PLAN BECAUSE OF THAT NON RESIDENT REPLACEMENT COMPONENT THAT TOTAL COST IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN IT NORMALLY WOULD BE IF THERE'S JUST A MOMENT REST. I DON'T WE WANT TO THE COMMITTEES THAT THAT THERE'S A BIT OF A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING AND WHAT THE UNIVERSITY IS PLANNING. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'LL HEAR FROM YOU SEE IN A MINUTE- YOU SEE IS PLANNING TO GROW IN A RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE BERMAN AROUND. TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF THE GROWTH ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON RESIDENT REDUCTION PLANS. ACCORDING TO YOU SEE I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE REMAINING FUNDS FOR THEIR FOR THEIR ADDITIONAL GROWTH AND APPLY IT TOWARDS OVER TARGET GROSS THAT IT EXPERIENCED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SH AND GIVEN THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS TO RESPECT THOSE EXPECTATIONS FOR ITS FALL EMISSIONS PLANNING THAT THAT IS VERY LIKELY THE MOMENT LEVEL THAT WILL OF A ROUGHLYOCCUR AT THE UNIVERSITY. SO THE ISSUE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS REALLY HOW TO RESPOND. TO THIS DISCONNECT. ARE WE THINK A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE TO- START WITH UC'S PLANNED TWO THOUSAND STUDENT GROWTH. THAT WOULD COST ABOUT FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO BASED ON THE MARGINAL COST RATE AND INCLUDING THAT ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON RESIDENT REDUCTION PLAN THAN THAT FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE COULD IT COULD PROVIDE UP TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED LEVEL NINETY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. DOING SO WOULD- PROVIDED FUNDING ESSENTIALLY FOR THAT OVER TARGET GROWTH. AND WOULD PROVIDE GENERAL FUNDING FOR YOU SEE THAT MORE COURSES. AN INCREASE JUST OVERALL A BASE. SUPPORT PER STUDENT AT UC. PAST HASN'T PROVIDED FUNDING OVER TARGET ROSE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. OMINOUS SOMETHING A LOT WANNA BE ABLE TO ABOUT JUST THAT- IT DOESN'T INCENTIVE FOR. TO NOT FOLLOWS STATE- AND MOMENT TARGET. THERE IS A ROW TO MAYBE AN EXTRA THIS YEAR THAT'S- YOU MIGHT RECALL TO TWENTY ONE WAS DURING PANDEMIC. AND YOU SEE DID ME PART DURING THE SUMMER- AND GIVEN ALL THAT IN. AROUND A MOMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC THE LET'S. MY BE INTERESTED IN IN SUPPORTING OVER TARGET MOMENTS THIS CASE IT IT'S REALLY FALLS ON THE LARGEST- WOULD LIKE DO THIS CASE. AS TO THE SECOND IS- IT'S- ABOUT AND WOMAN IN. YEARS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE. THE STATE'S FIRST PRACTICE YESTERDAY A WOMAN TARGET FOR THE TWENTY. TWENTY THREE TO FOUR- THIS TAKING THE CIPRO BECAUSE- YOU SEE YOUR MAKES FALL IT- THIS DECISION. BEFORE THE LETTER CAN ENACT THE FINAL BY IN JUNE. THAT MEANS THERE WAY THE LEGISLATURE INFLUENCE MISSION. JUST TO SET A TARGET FOR THE FALL YEAR THERE BY GIVE YOU SEE TO PLAN FOR THAT IT MAKES FALL MISSION. NO WE DON'T HAVE ANY. RECOMMENDATION TO THE- LEVEL THAT THE LOWER. I SHOULD SET A MOMENT BUT WE DO OUR SOME FAQ. YOU CAN FIRST ON THE BOTTOM OF ELEVEN. YOU KNOW THE ONE HAND IT. OF IT WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROJECTIONS FOR STATE DEMOGRAPHICS THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE- SERVER HUGE LEVEL OF GROWTH ANTICIPATED. FOR YOU KNOW NORMAN DEMAND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE PROJECTED TO RISE VERY SLIGHTLY. AND THEN- THREE TO CULTURAL BUT IT'S ACTUALLY- EXPECTED TO BE DOWN. THAT COULD INFLUENCE THAT TRANSFER WILL DEMAND IN THE COMING YEARS. ON THE OTHER HAND AS THE AS YOU MAY KNOW THE- UNIVERSITY HAS A PRETTY LARGE POOL OF STUDENTS THAT IT- REFERS- IT BECAUSE IT SEEMS COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE FIRST CHOICE CAMPUS- STUDENTS ARE CHEN WORK RIVERSIDE OR WORSE. AND VERY FEW THE STUDENTS END UP. EXCEPT THEIR IMAGE OFFER. SO INCREASING AND- COULD ALLOW UNIT COMEDY MORE SEE TO THEIR FOR CHOICE CAN. REGARDLESS OF THE EXACT HARD YOU SAID WE WELCOME THAT INSTEAD OF UP FOR GROWTH. TARGET SAID HELLO TARGETS IT'S AN EXTRA. GROW WITH THOUSANDS OVER PRETTY YEAR RIGHT SAY. AND YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW SOME TWO HUNDRED OR WHATEVER THE LEVEL IN IN THIS YEAR. WE GOT A PRO- HAS THE BEEN OF. REALLY CLEAR WHAT THAT THE IS MORE THAN FOUR SO THAT WHEN THE UNIT IS HAS A MOMENT PLAN LARGEST CAN. HOLD ACCOUNTABLE TO- WHAT ITS EXPECTATIONS FOR. WITHOUT IT WE HAVE TO ANSWER ANY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO UC. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS COMMITTED TO GROWING ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WE RECOGNIZE THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY ARE CONNECTED AND THAT ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY. OF CALIFORNIA WILL GIVE OUR FUTURE STUDENTS THE CHANCE TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED A SIXTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION ONGOING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT BY SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS BY TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THESE FUNDS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE BASE BUDGET INCREASE WE'VE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. HERE SEE APPRECIATES THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN OUR STUDENTS AND WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE FUNDS. WE DO HAVE A REQUEST ON HOW THIS PROPOSED ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS WOULD BE MEASURED. THE LAST TIME THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TO UNIVERSITY WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDS WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AT THAT TIME YOU FUNDED FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY STUDENTS OVER TWO YEARS AT OUR CAMPUSES. THE UNIVERSITY EXCEEDED THIS TARGET IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ARE REQUESTING THAT YOU COUNT ALL THE STUDENTS ABOUT THE FUNDED ENROLLMENT TARGET SET IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AS ENROLLMENT TOWARDS THE GOAL OF SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS. THE UNIVERSITY WANTS TO PROVIDE ALL OUR STUDENTS WITH EQUAL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. AND FUNDING THE STUDENTS WILL ALLOW US TO HIRE FACULTY TO TEACH COURSES AND THE STAFF TO PROVIDE ACADEMIC SERVICES THAT THE STUDENTS. COMING TO STUDENTS ENROLLED ABOVE THE TARGETED ENROLLMENT SET IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN. WOULD MEAN THAT THE CAMPUSES WOULD ENROLL AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE HUNDRED NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. IN ADDITION TO THE SAN ROMAN GROWTH THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES UP THIRTY ONE MILLION I'M GOING FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO REPLACE NINE HUNDRED AND TO NONRESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ON THE UC BERKELEY UCLA AND UC SAN DIEGO CAMPUS AS- THE CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THEIR FALL TWENTY TWO ENROLLMENT PLANS AND ALL THREE CAMPUSES INTEND TO REPLACE THREE HUNDRED NONRESIDENT STUDENTS. WITH CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES THE REACH THIS NINE HUNDRED AND TWO STUDENT REPLACEMENT GOAL. RECEIVING THE FUNDING FOR THE NON RESIDENT REPLACEMENT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE CAMPUSES RELY ON THESE FUNDS FOR MANY ASPECTS OF THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS. FROM HIRING FACULTY TO TEACH MORE COURSES THE STUDENT SERVICES TO MAINTAINING THE CAMPUS FACILITIES. CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED OVER 12% OF CAMPUS CORE FUNDS FROM NONRESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION PAID BY NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. THE NEW ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND NON RESIDENTS REPLACEMENT PLAN MEANS THAT WITH THE CURRENT FUNDING PROVIDED UC CAMPUSES WILL ADD ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. FOR FALL TWENTY ONE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED THEIR LARGEST NUMBER OF UNDERGRADUATE APPLICATIONS IN OUR HISTORY AND ADMITTED OUR MOST DIVERSE FRESHMAN CLASS EVER THE UNIVERSITY ALSO ENROLLED MORE LAST NEXT TO DANCE AND FALL TWENTY ONE THAN EVER BEFORE AND MORE AFRICAN AMERICAN GRADUATE STUDENTS THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS YEAR. TO CONTINUE THE SUCCESS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO SUPPORT UNIVERSITY IN FUTURE YEARS WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE 5% ANNUAL BASE BUDGET INCREASES SUPPORT FOR THOSE AND ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT IS VITAL TO PROVIDING INCREASED ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE YOU SEE STUDENTS. THE ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES ANNUALLY. AND AN ANNUAL STATE SUPPORT COST OF ROUGHLY. TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION AS ENROLLMENT GROWS. N ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S MULTI YEAR BUDGET PROPOSED SOUL INCLUDES ENROLLMENT OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NEW GRADUATE STUDENTS BETWEEN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN WITH THE FUNDING COMING FROM THE PROPOSED 5% BASED BUDGET INCREASE. PRESIDENT DRAKE WANTS TO INCREASED UNIVERSITY IS A ROMAN BY TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS BY TWENTY THIRTY. INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSED GROSS ARE SIXTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES AND FOUR THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS. THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS INCLUDE THE REPLACEMENT OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS GOAL. SOME OF THE PROPOSED NEW ENROLLMENT WILL BE ACCOMMODATED THROUGH INCREASED ONLINE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES BY INCREASING GRADUATION RATES TO ALLOW FOR FASTER THROUGHPUT OF STUDENTS. AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF SUMMER SESSIONS IN CLOSING WE REQUEST YOU SUPPORT THE FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BE USED TO ENROLLMENT. BUT CHANGE THE MEASUREMENT FOR ROMAN GROWTH TO BE FROM THE FUNDED LEVEL AND THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS AND- BEFORE WE GET TO A OF A FEW QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GET TOO FAR AWAY FROM THOSE PRESENTATIONS. I WAS GONNA ASK THE L. A. O. TO COMMENT. ON WHAT THE UNIVERSITY JUST SAID ABOUT HOW TO COUNT ENROLLMENT AND WHAT YOUR OPINION IS ABOUT THE- AND YOU MIGHT EVEN JUST EXPLAIN. YOUR UNDERLYING FACTUAL LOOK AT IT AS WELL SO THAT IT'S JUST CLEAR TO US WHAT THE CHOICES. I SURE SO THE- THE- WHAT. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT SENATE EXPECTATION THAT YOU SEE GROW ENROLLMENT BY SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS. AND IT WAS OVER THE LEVEL IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE LANGUAGE THERE BUT DIDN'T SPECIFY THAT IT WAS OVER A FUNDED BASELINE OR IF IT ASSEMBLY CATION IT WAS OVER SORT OF THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT IN THAT YEAR. UC'S TELLING YOU THAT- AND MOMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE CAME IN ABOVE WHAT WAS BUT THEY HAD EXPECTED AND A LOT OF THAT WAS DRIVEN BY THE PANDEMIC- IN DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE IS A HUGE GROWTH IN SUMMER ROMANCE AND THAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY- YOU KNOW THE AVAILABILITY OF ONLINE COURSES DURING THE SUMMER OR PERHAPS LIMITED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES DURING THE SUMMER. AND THAT AND THAT GROWTH HAS PERSISTED INTO THE CURRENT YEAR TOO SO IT'S NOT LIKE A MOMENT WHEN DOWN THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THE UNIVERSITY BUT LET ME DO IT LET ME TRY TO SIMPLIFY THIS AND SEE IF WE CAN GET A TO AN ELEVATOR SPEECH IT IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS THAT UC'S INTERPRETING WHAT THE BASELINE WAS A VOTE FOR THE SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED OR WHATEVER THAT IT ADDITIONAL FUNDED GROWTH A DIFFERENT THAN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR INTENT OR WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT WHEN WE DID IT- IT IS IT THAT. WE WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED OVER THE CURRENT GROWTH AND DAY ADMITTED MMHM WELL IS THERE A MOMENT WAS HIGHER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE WHEN THEY DID THE ADMITTED TO THEY'RE DOING IT FROM THE HIGHER ENROLLMENT THAT THEY- HAD I'M TRYING TO YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT'S A I THINK THAT'S A FAIR WAY OF STAYING AT DATE OF THE BUDGET ACT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WHERE IT WAS. DEGREE WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER ACT KNOWN. BUT YOU SEE LIKE. TO- COUNT TOWARD WHAT THE AS STAR SOURCE OF THERE BUT LEVEL OF MOMENT WHICH WAS. HELLO BECAUSE OF CERTAIN PASSED EXPECT. AND BUT ACTS OCCURRED HAVING MUCH PUTTING INTO MOUTHS TODAY O WHAT I THE PRETTY. THAT YOU RECORDS. WOULD BE IS TO IT THIS YEAR WE SPENT. WHAT IN ROME MAIN OF THAN. WHY IN ROME MEANS AND HOWEVER WE ADOPT OUR ACTIONS. YEAH THAT'S CORRECT WE RECOMMEND INSTEAD OF- THE WAY WE ARE PHRASE IT IS INSTEAD OF SETTING UP A GROWTH TARGET TO SAYING. SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS OVER A PREVIOUS YEAR YOU SAY WE WANT. WE WANT YOU SEE WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE TO A ROLL. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OR HOW MANY. HOW MANY- WHAT LEVEL STUDENTS SAID YEAH- THE STATE WOULD LIKE TO ENROLL WE THINK THAT WOULD CLARIFY THE ACTUAL BASS LINE AND THEN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S EXPECTING. OUR I JUST AS A COMMENT I THINK THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. BUT I ALSO WOULD SAY THAT. THAT'S ALL HE ONLY THIS THE UPPER THAT. ON THIS. I GET THE FOR TO WORK AT ALL FOR OF YOU. IT APPEARED THAT THE DA. OF OR A JOY THE FIRST PART OF YOUR- SO LET ME GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT WORDS WITH. THEIR PERCEIVED ENJOYMENT YEAH. THANK YOU CHAIR I'LL JUST I'LL JUST ECHO THAT THAT. JUST TIE EVERYTHING TOGETHER THAT'S BEEN SADDENED THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE ENROLLMENT FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FOR YOU SEE. THIS ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED IS THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. WAS THERE WAS INTENSE SET UP. WHERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE ACTUALLY. ARE LESS CLEAR THEY WERE NOT CLEAR AT THAT TIME AND NOW WE KNOW THAT THE KOBE YEAR YEAH ACADEMIC YEAR. I HAD A DRAMATIC SPIKE FOR UC SO THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION IS WE NEGOTIATED THE CALM. THINKING THAT. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT WE'RE GONNA PROPOSED FULLY FUNDING AT THE SIXTY TWO THIRTY WOULD MATERIALIZE IN THIS UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR. AS NEW UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. HOWEVER WE ALL SAY THAT WE ARE. OPEN TO CONSIDERING IT GOING FORWARD WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND YOU SEE BECAUSE WE'RE RECOGNIZING IT'S A COMPLEX ISSUE ON TO ANOTHER QUESTION LET ME MAKE A COMMENT WHICH IS I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS DISCUSSION AND I THINK AS WE MOVE TOWARD THE MAY REVISE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEEK CLARITY. IN OUR HOW WE DESIGNATE- OTHER. THAN ROMAN AND I KNOW THAT THAT WE USUALLY. LIKE TO MAXIMIZE THE FUNDING AND SO I'M SURE WE WOULD LOVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY WHAT WE THOUGHT OUR INTENT WAS IS LIFT WITH BUT I ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THERE'S COMPLEXITY TO THIS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD JUST HAVE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD AND I DON'T FEEL READY TO. EXCEPT THE WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THEN LET ME- ASK A FEW QUESTIONS. AND ONE IS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS MENTIONED I THINK IN YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOU WORK TO KEEP UP WITH THE F. ACADEMIC INFRASTRUCTURE I KNOW I TALK TO PEOPLE ON SOME CAMPUSES THAT DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT IS HAPPENING SO HOW DO YOU ENSURE. THAT YOU ADD THE ADDITIONAL AND ROMAN AND THAT THERE IS A CORRESPONDING INCREASE OF ACADEMIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS THE NEED FOR WHICH IS CREATED BY THE ADDITIONAL MOMENT HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR OUR CAMPUSES HAVE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH SET GUIDANCE FOR HOW THE CAMPUS SHOULD- DEVELOP INFRASTRUCTURE TO MATCH NEW STUDENT GROSS. OR TO GUIDE NEW STUDENT GROWTH- IN ADDITION THE REGENTS APPROVE A FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN ANNUALLY. THAT SPECIFIES THE PROJECTS OF WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE SYSTEM CONSTRUCT NEXT- IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THESE PROJECTS THE UNIVERSITY HAS NOT HAD A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. WE HAVE BEEN USING OUR OWN INTERNAL FINANCING MECHANISMS TO FIND NEW PROJECT CONSTRUCTION- BUT WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WE CAN ONLY FIND A FEW PROJECTS ANNUALLY. SO THE THIRD THE PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING NEW BUILDINGS ON CAMPUSES IS SLOW BECAUSE WE ARE LIMITED IN HOW MUCH FINANCING WE HAVE ACCESS TO- WE WILL BE PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUESTS. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE REGION'S FIVE YEAR PLAN IF YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH IT AND SELECT SOME PROJECTS THAT SEEM. LIKE SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO FIND- BUT OUR FOR OUR REQUEST IS- THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING VERY SOON IS FOR ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE SEISMIC RENOVATION OF BUILDINGS AND SOME NEW ACADEMIC SPACE. ARM I JUST HAVE TO COMMENT ON TO AT THE END IT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE BASICALLY PUTTING IT BACK ON US AND OF COURSE I SUPPORT THE BUILDINGS ARE SUPPORTED BOND. AND EVERYTHING BUT- WHEN WE'RE DISCUSSING INCREASED ENROLLMENTS AND WHEN YOUR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS ARE PUT FORWARD IT SAYS STUDENTS ARE ACCEPTED AND THEN IT'S LIKE WELL IT'S ON US TO HAVE THE FACILITIES. HE IS THE STUDENTS WERE WERE OUR ACCEPTED AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE IT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS THERE WAS A HUGE DISAGREEMENT OVER THE ONE IN SANTA CRUZ WHICH IS MY HOME CAMPUS. AND IT WAS A DISAGREEMENT OVER THE FAX. AND SOME OF THE ADVOCATES CONTENDED THAT A 100% OF THE ENROLLMENT WAS ADMITTED AND THAT 7% OF THE NON ENROLLMENT COMMITMENTS WERE MADE THE UNIVERSITY DISAGREE STRENUOUSLY AND SAYS IT WAS A AND IT WAS CLOSE TO A 100% OF THE FACILITIES CAME WITH IT. BUT IT'S WHY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LAST BOND. ADOPTED LANGUAGE THAT SAID. HE WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEXT BUILDING IN A BOND UNTIL YOU MITIGATED THE IMPACTS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PREVIOUS BONTA BECAUSE FREQUENTLY THE UNIVERSITY WOULD ASK FOR THE COST OF THE BUILDING AND SO WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THE- FOR THE MITIGATION. AND I THINK THE SAME THING APPLIES HERE AND I THOUGHT THE SOLUTION. TO THE CONTENTIOUS LRCP IN SANTA CRUZ LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PAN. WAS THAT IT'S FINE TO PROJECT- SIXTEEN THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS OVER TWENTY YEARS OR WHATEVER IT WAS. BUT DID YOU WOULD NOT ADVANCE TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ENROLLMENT VENTO YOU COMMITTED TO ADVANCE TO DIFFERENT ROMANCE OF THE ACADEMIC AND PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN A PHASE FOR THAT ENROLLMENT GOING. THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO SAY WELL YOU GUYS DIDN'T FUNDED SO WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE TO STUDENTS AND WE WON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO IT THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY. OF DOING IT AND I KNOW. EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT ON OUR AGENDA THERE ARE PROPOSALS FOR A BOND. AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES RIGHT NOW VISIT THE SENATE IS INTERESTED IN INCLUDING HIGHER EDUCATION BUT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL DOES NOT. AND I HAPPENED TO SEE PRIVATE POLLING THAT SHOWS. THERE'S MORE SUPPORT FOR THE K. THROUGH TWELVE THEY'RE STILL SUPPORT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION BUT WE HAVE TO NAVIGATE THAT BUT IT IT. IT JUST IT IS A BONE OF CONTENTION AND SO- I THINK THOSE LONG RANGE PLANS ONLY GO SO FAR RIGHT NOW IT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT THERE'S NO COMMITMENT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND- AND TO CONNECT THE ENROLLMENT WITH THE ACADEMIC OR PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN INCREMENTS. BUT THAT THAT LEADS TO THE- THE OTHER TWO QUESTIONS I HAVE BEEN MAYBE. MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT ONE OF THEM UNDER HOUSING BUT BUT- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SANTA CRUZ HAS SAID IN THEIR LATEST LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND- THEY WILL NOT. THAT NEW HOUSING WILL COVER ALL NEW STUDENTS A. AND SORT OF BUT- I CAN'T TELL IF THERE'S AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM SO. SO HOW DOES THAT WORK. HOW WILL WORK TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE OUR T. PAY THAT THE KNOWN ROMAN CROSS WON'T HAPPEN UNLESS THERE'S HOUSING. AND THAT'S TO UC. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT OUR RD PEACE ARE KIND OF GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. AND THAT THEY ARE NOT INTENDED TO- STRICTLY SAY YEAR TO YEAR HOW GROSS WILL OCCUR. IN ADDITION- WE GET. OUR INVOLVEMENT GROSS NUMBERS FROM. THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT ENROLLMENT GROWTH CAN OCCUR WITHIN A SINGLE YEAR. BUT IT TAKES A THREE YEARS SOMETIMES LONGER TO BUILD A NEW BUILDING TO ACCOMMODATE GROWTH SO. THE ACADEMIC BUILDING SPACE ARE ADDITIONS AND IN ROMAN GROWS ARE MOVING ON PARALLEL TRACKS BUT NOT ALWAYS AND- STEADY ALIGNMENT- CAPITAL SPACE IS OFTEN A LAGGING. INDICATOR TO THE ENROLLMENT GROSS- THE CAMPUS OF CENTER IF THEY ARE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT THEIR NEW FACILITIES- THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE ENROLLMENT GROSS THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE ON THAT CAMPUS- BUT THAT ABILITY FOR THAT CAMPUS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE NEW PROJECTS. IS OF COURSE DEPENDENT ON A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS. I AGREE BUT IT IT IS ALWAYS. A WHAT WAS JUST REFERRED TO AS A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT IS NOT ACCEPTED ALL THE TIME BY COURTS AS BEING A GUIDE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT- ARE THERE LOOKING FOR ACTUAL. IMPLEMENTATION AND I THINK IT'S THE REASON THERE'S- DIFFICULT RELATIONS WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IS. IT'S ARE WE MEAN WHAT WE SAY BUT IT'S JUST A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT. AND THEREFORE THINGS WILL HAPPEN THAT AREN'T REALLY ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT WHICH ACTUALLY. SICK WHAT COULD COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON AND- AND I WILL SPARE THE COMMITTEE THAT. THE SECOND DOOR THAT YOU OPENED IT'S JUST I'M DESPERATELY TRYING TO HELP THE UNIVERSITY WITH THAT THREE THOUSAND UNIT PROJECTED. IT IN SANTA CRUZ BUT DON'T WANT TO HELP THEMSELVES THEY WANT TO BUILD A HUNDRED FIFTY UNITS ON A MEADOW AND IF THEY JUST MOVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. TO WHERE THE OTHER TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY A PARTICULAR LAWSUIT WOULD GO AWAY THEY COULD MOVE ON AND WE WOULD BRING ALL THESE PEOPLE IN SUPPORT BUT IT. CAN'T SOMEHOW IT CAN'T EVER BE FIGURED. OUT IT KEEPS THE CONFLICT GO. INDIFFERENT ARE WHICH WHICH TO LAST. HOME AND THAT IS IT'S THE RELATED QUESTION OF. THERE IS ALL THE TALK OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH BUT WATER THE PAY AND I KNOW YOU JUST SAID THAT ARE ALL THE SELLER DP'S. BUT HOW WAS UC PLANNING FOR THE PHYSICAL LOCATION OF THE GROWTH THAT IS PLANNED IN THE CELLAR DP'S I MEAN WHERE'S IT GOING AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT MAYBE NOT ALL OF IT CAN BE ACCOMMODATED ON THE EXISTING CAMPUSES WATER YOUR LONG RANGE PLANS TO DEAL WITH. WITH PHYSICAL PLANT TO ACCOMMODATE GROWTH. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS. BUT IN THE LONG RUN WE INTEND TO UTILIZE MANY METHODS TO ACCUMULATE- TOOK ON THE DATE OUR NEW ENROLLMENT GROWTH. WE ARE GOING TO BE INCREASING ONLINE COURSES- THE GOVERNOR'S POLICY GOAL SET THE GOAL OF DOUBLING OUR ONLINE COURSES OR ONLINE UNITS FOR THE UNIVERSITY. WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE OUR SUMMER SESSIONS OFFERINGS TO TRY TO GET STUDENTS TO MOVE THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY FASTER IF THEY TAKE SUMMER SESSION COURSES WE CAN GET THEM TO GRADUATE FASTER. AND THEY WILL OPEN UP NEW SPACES ARE THERE SPACES WILL OPEN UP FOR NEW STUDENTS. WERE ALSO GOING TO LOOK AT FUNDING MECHANISMS FOR NEW FACILITIES- ON OUR CAMPUSES I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE- HIGHER EDUCATION AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM- AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT OTHER POSSIBLE STUDENT HOUSING FUNDING MECHANISMS. THAT WOULD ALLOW TO UNIVERSITY TO ACCESS THE FINANCING NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL- HOUSING FOR STUDENTS. IT'S JUST A COMMENT WHICH IS AWESOME ON THE CSU SIDE ARE WE DEALT WITH THE FACT THAT WE STANISLAUS STATE THEY'RE GOING TO DO A CENTERED STOCKTON THAT WAS FUNDED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR THAT WHILE COMMITTED ADDITIONAL GROWTH THAT MIGHT NOT A FIT ON THE CAMPUS. AND OUR WAS ALWAYS A PROPONENT OF THE MILLS COLLEGE ACQUISITION WHICH SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE PROBLEMS THESE DAYS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE INDEPENDENT SITES AFFILIATED WITH CAMPUSES TO GET TO THE GROWTH ISSUES AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD TRY TO HELP YOU WITH. I'M THAT COMPLETES MY QUESTIONS AND I DON'T HAVE ONE I THINK OF FROM SENATOR MAN SO LET ME ASK CENTER ROADSHOW BOGUS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH- THE DISCUSSION IS THE VERY MEANS ENGAGING FOR. PERMEATE BECAUSE I ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT. I'VE ACTUALLY WE THINK HOW DO I. THERE WERE THE UNIVERSE TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GROWTH AND AB AND IT. BASICALLY PLACE IT ON THE UNIVERSITIES TO FACILITATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH WITH HE AT TEACHER AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND I TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS THINKING ABOUT AND THE REASON I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE- THE- MY GOODNESS I JUST. LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT THE- THE DEFER THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS JUST. IN MY OPINION JUST GROWING EXPONENTIALLY IN BUT WE'RE ALLOCATING TOWARDS A DEFERRED PAYMENT AND I THOUGHT WE'RE NOT MAINTAINING THE STRUCTURES AND- FOR THE DAY INTERPRETERS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. HOW DO WE EXPECT THAT THESE STUDENTS TO COME IN AND ACTUALLY- HAVE BOTH TEACHERS AND CLASSES COURSES OFFERED IN A FACILITY TO ATTEND BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND THE ONLINE ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND HOW THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL- IN. IN MITIGATING THE NEW AND ROMAN BUT- I AM STILL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- ASPECT OF OUR UNIVERSITIES- OUR WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE ACTUALLY THROUGHOUT YOU KNOW OUR OUR FROM. K. ALL THE WAY TO. OUR OUR UNIVERSITIES AND THEY THE FOR PAYMENTS ARE DUE FOR MAINTENANCE ON THAT ASPECT SO. MY CONCERN WAS WERE EXPECTING THESE UNIVERSITIES TO ENROLL AN X. AMOUNT OF STUDENTS. AND YET WE'RE NOT OUT ARE WE'RE NOT OUT OF ALLOTTING. A SPECIFIC AMOUNT ARE ENOUGH IN MY OPINION- TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE RICHEST INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THEN AGAIN. I TOOK NOTE IN HERE THAT- THE NEAR ROMAN FUNDING WOULD GO TOWARDS NEW HIRING WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL IN COURSE- AVAILABILITY BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I OFTEN ALSO HERE IS THAT OUR STUDENTS DON'T HAVE COURSE. AT COURSES THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE SO. IN THE BACK OF A MIND THING HOW DO WE MITIGATE THAT HOW DO WE EXPECT YOU TO GROW. BUT YET. THERE ISN'T THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CURRENTLY ENOUGH CLASSES OUR COURSES- FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GRADUATE SO. THERE WAS A DISPARITY THURMOND WAS TRYING SO THANK YOU I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE- YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING NURSING. CENTER LARRY- AS FAR AS THE QUESTION- C. SO I HAVE ONE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND IT'S- WHAT IS THE REASON FOR FUNDING AND ROAMING GROWTH GIVEN THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED GROWTH AND THE UC'S EXPECTED GROWTH. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR. SOLDIERS SAY THAT BASED ON WHAT WE HEARD WITH ALL THE PRESENTATIONS AND- THE EARLIER QUESTIONS- IT YOU KNOW IT HAD ALL REPEAT THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE- UC'S ROLE MEANT LEVEL FOR. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS. ARE OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL IS USING THE BASELINE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AT TWO. TO FUND- SIXTY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX NEW UNDERGRADUATES IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. FOR THAT WOULD BE SIXTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND THAT WOULD SUPPORT THAT. HOWEVER WE'RE WE'RE OPEN DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH YOU SEE TO MAKE SURE WE GET A REST. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH I THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS PANEL. THANKS FOR INDULGING ME ASKING AN ENROLLMENT QUESTION UNDER ISSUE ONE. HUNDRED WEEKS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT WHETHER IT WAS AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE'RE GONNA MOVED ISSUE THREE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAME PANELISTS LET'S BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. ALL AND THAT BILL LAST YEAR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE SAME PURPOSE SO WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD ON THE PREVIOUS- INVESTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS A MESSAGE THAT YOU'LL HEAR US REPEAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WHICH IS WE THINK THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A REASONABLE USE OF ONE TIME FINDING. A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS IF THEY AREN'TADDRESSED- IN THE BUDGET YEAR THEY WILL HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE FUTURE YOU'RE AT A HIGHER COST CHAU DRESSING THEM NOW. HELPS IMPROVE THE UNIVERSITY IN THE STATE'S BUDGET RESILIENCY. THE PROPOSAL ALSO SUPPORTED ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS AND THOSE ARE REASONABLE TOO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY RESULT IN- ONGOING- UTILITY SAVINGS FOR THE UNIVERSITY. NOW THAT SAID AS SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE- THERE IS A BIGGER ISSUE AT HAND WE WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE THIRD BACKGROUND PARAGRAPH ON PAGE FIFTEEN. AND IN THAT PARAGRAPH YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU SEE ESTIMATES ITS EXISTING MAINTENANCE BACKLOG TO BE SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. AND ON TOP OF THAT YOU SEE ESTIMATES IT HAS A TEN YEAR CAPITAL RENEWAL NEED OF TWELVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT MEANS THAT THE UNIVERSITY ESTIMATES IT WOULD HAVE TO SPEND AROUND ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR TO KEEP THAT SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG FROM GROWING FURTHER. FOR COMPARISON YOU SEE CURRENTLY SPEND JUST UNDER THREE HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY ON MAINTENANCE. SO THAT'S A DIFFERENCE APPROACHING A BILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF FUNDING. THE GIVEN THE HIGH BACKLOG WE RECOMMEND THAT THELEGISLATURE TREAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED- FUNDING LEVEL FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AS A STARTING POINT. POTENTIALLY PROVIDING A MORE FUNDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IF THEY BECOME AVAILABLE MAY REVISION OR EVEN FUNDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE- HAS CONCERNS THAT WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OTHER AGENCIES. TO SERVE A LONGER TERM STRATEGY TO ADDRESS UC'S MAINTENANCE NEEDS. GIVEN SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ISSUE IT'S UNLIKELY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A LONG TERM STRATEGY BY THE END OF THIS BUDGET CYCLE BUT IT'S SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE COULD START CONSIDERING. TERMS OF HOW MUCH FUNDING TO PROVIDE OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME. ALL THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE VERSUS THE UNIVERSITY IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR PAST SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITIES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE EFFORTS THE APPROPRIATIONS RECEIVED IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDING THE FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENTS HAVE HELPED TO RESOLVE EMERGENCY SYSTEM FAILURES AND HAVE A LOT OF THE CAMPUS AGAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS UC'S CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS CAMPUSES WILL UTILIZE THESE FUNDS TO RENEW BUILDING SYSTEMS ENSURE LIFE SAFETY STANDARDS AND IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN CAMPUS BUILDINGS I REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENT. THE UNIVERSITY OCCUPIES APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION GROSS SQUARE FEET OF SPACE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS CAMPUS IS ENGAGED IN AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS TO EVALUATE THE COST OF CAPITAL OUTLAY RENEWAL NEEDS AND DETERMINES THAT SYSTEM WIDE. CAMPUSES HAVE TWELVE POINT THREE BILLION AND NEED THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES A SIZABLE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND SEISMIC RENOVATIONS FAR AGING BUILDINGS. THE UNIVERSITY USES TO INTEGRATED CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR I CAN'T DETRACT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS THE MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS IN THE LIST ARE BRED IN THE I CAN'T SYSTEM AND THE UNIVERSITY CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION AND READ CATEGORY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE LAST BUDGET I'M PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE WILL HELP THE UNIVERSITY MAKES SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON ADDRESSING THESE CRITICAL PROJECTS. STILL THE UNIVERSITY'S CAPITAL NEEDS ARE GREAT AND WE ARE REQUESTING THE LEGISLATURE FOR ONE POINT SIX BILLION TO ADDRESS A COMBINATION OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SEISMIC PROJECTS A NEW ACADEMIC FACILITIES. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OUR CAMPUSES RECEIVE A THIRD. OF THEIR ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE- HOWEVER SIX OF OUR CAMPUS HAVE THEIR OWN NOT GAS HEATING PLANTS BECAUSE- AND THEN I. NINETIES DECOMMISSIONING THOSE FACILITIES WILL TAKE TIME AND WILL BE EXPENSIVE BUT IS NECESSARY FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CARBON EMISSIONS. BECAUSE OF THIS OUR REQUEST INCLUDES CAMPUS DECARBONISATION STUDIES. IN TERMS OF THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTION ON HOW THESE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS CAN BE ADDRESSED. WE YOU HAVE VARIOUS FUNDING INSTRUMENTS THAT YOU CAN AUTHORIZE DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS ARE PREFERABLE FOR SMALLER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THAT KEEP COMING UP AS INFRASTRUCTURE AGES. FOR SEISMIC RENOVATION IN DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS OR GRANTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WE WOULD FAVOR AND NO INTEREST REVOLVING LOAN FUND DEDICATED FOR THAT PURPOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ARM I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR MAN BUT LET ME JUST ASK A GLOBAL ONE FIRS AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S- WHO WHO COULD ANSWER IT BUT IT WAS JUST SAID THAT ONE POINT SIX BILLION IS THE BACKLOG A HUNDRED MILLION THIS. IS IN THE BUDGET- FOR UC. IT IS IN YOUR BACK OR GREATER THAN ONE POINT SIX BILLION OR SET YOUR TOTAL BACKLOG- NO I REQUEST IS ONE POINT SIX BILLION FOR THE- FOUR. TWENTY THREE- LET'S JUST BE LINEAR YOUR TOTAL AMOUNT OF BACKLOG. YOUR REQUEST AND WHAT'S RECOMMENDED SO IF ONE POINT SIX BILLION IS WHAT YOU'RE REQUESTING HUNDRED MILLION IS WHAT'S RECOMMENDED WHAT YOUR TOTAL AMOUNT OF. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF NEED IS ABOUT TWELVE POINT THREE BILLION OKAY THANK YOU. AND THEN US SENATOR MAN WANTED TO ASK THE QUESTION OF FOR UC'S BACKLOG AMOUNT HOW MUCH WOULD BE CONSIDERED SHOVEL READY OR COULD BE STARTED IN THE NEXT YEAR IF IT WERE FUNDED. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SIR BECAUSE OF OUR ID CAMPS SYSTEM WE HAVE ARE PROJECTS WELL DEFINED- WE COULD GET GOING VERY QUICKLY ON THESE CRITICAL PROJECTS THAT ARE. ALREADY ALL LOGGED IN OUR SYSTEM THAT'S SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION IN PROJECTS THAT I DISCUSSED. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WILL SLOW DOWN HOW QUICKLY CAMPUSES CAN GET STARTED. IS THAT WE DO NEED TO HAVE CONTRACTS FOR- PROJECTS WITH THE- WITH THE CONSTRUCTION FIRM THAT COMES IN TO TAKE CARE OF STOP WORK OR OR TO TRADES- INDIVIDUALS OF WE HIRE. SO BUT BASICALLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF PROJECTS ARE SHOVEL READY PENDING THE ABILITY TO GET CONTRACTORS AND WORKERS SECONDS CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN. A SENATOR MEN'S OTHER QUESTION- WAS. I THINK IT'S OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ARM R. Y. IF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS DON'T COUNT TOWARD AGAIN LIMIT IS THE ADMINISTRATION ONLY PUTTING FORTH A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHEN A MUCH LARGER INVESTMENT COULD REDUCE THE TOTAL BACKLOG. AND COUNT AGAINST AGAIN LIMIT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- CENTER LAYERED- MEN BE A LAYER- SO WE'RE- OUR OUR PROPOSAL IS FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT'S THAT'S HOW WE LANDED IN STRUCTURING THE OVERALL BUDGET- AND THINKING ABOUT THAT CAN LIMIT. AND I ALL KNOW THAT THAT YOU KNOW THE- SEVERAL VOICES HAVE HAVE I HAVE EMPHASIZED THAT THIS IS A BIG ISSUE AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS- DEDICATED TO THINKING ABOUT THIS AND DOING SOMETHING ON IT ALL ALL AGAIN SAY THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION- THAT WAS SOMETHING WE WERE IN FAVOR OF- THIS HUNDRED MILLION. IS IT IS WHERE WE LANDED FOR THIS PROPOSAL BUT MAY REVISE- IS ALWAYS ANOTHER MOMENT IN TIME. THANK YOU FOR OF FOR. THAT IS SEMI CRYPTIC COMMENTED ACTUALLY CONVEYED A LOT OF MEANING SO- APPRECIATE THAT AND AS I SAID IN ONE OF THE PREVIOUS HEARING STUFF THE JAN TEN BUDGET ARE USUALLY BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE BUDGET ADOPTED IN JUNE AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S THE ONE TIME THINGS WHETHER IT'S A PERSON STIRS BY DOWN OR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES REPORT NUMBERS. AT THE END I DID THAT COMPLETE YOUR QUESTIONS ARE CENTER JOB OKAY THAT COMPLETES OUR QUESTIONS WE THANK YOU AND WE KNOW THAT'S A MOVING TARGET OF WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NMBER FOR VARIOUS GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND WE HAVE THE SAME PANELISTS WILL GO IN THE SAME ORDER WILL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SOME COVERING IN THIS ITEM- THREE PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE FIRST IS TEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. LEVY FOR RESEARCH ON DYSLEXIA AT THE- UC SAN FRANCISCO DYSLEXIA CENTER ALL NOTED THAT BUILDS ON PREVIOUS INVESTMENTS AT THE SAME CENTER. AND THE OTHER IS EIGHTY TWO MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY. OF CALIFORNIA FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER THAT'S LOCATED AT DAVIS. AND THE THIRD IS. A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT- THIS IS A BIT WONKY BUT WE'RE WE'RE PROPOSING TO DECREASE THE GENERAL FUND BACK FILL FOR YOU SEE. THIS RELATED TO PROPERTY SIX REVENUES. ESSENTIALLY UC. NEEDS A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR TOTAL TO STAY WHERE THEY'VE BEEN I WITH THAT PROGRAM AND THIS TECHNICAL JUSTIN WOULD KEEP THEM THERE. DID YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY ROCKY OF FINANCE TEST TO IDENTIFY THIS WONKY. BECAUSE USUALLY THAT'S WHERE YOU GO SO LET'S GO TO THE L. A. HOW THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. SOME OF THE THREE PROPOSALS AND THIS ISSUE- WE RAISE CONCERNS WITH JUST ONE PROPOSAL AND THAT IS THE- PROPOSAL AROUND DYSLEXIA RESEARCH- FOR MORE BACKGROUND- PAGE TWENTY OF YOUR AGENDA- PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION ON THE UC SAN FRANCISCO DYSLEXIA CENTER. AND IS THE MINISTRATION NOTED OF THE STATE HAS PROVIDED ONE TIME FUNDING IN PREVIOUS YEARS FOR THE CENTER ARE PRIMARILY AROUND A DEVELOPING NEW SCREENING TOOLS THAT- OFF A FLAG REALLY INDICATIONS OF LEARNING CHALLENGES AMONG KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE STUDENTS- THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THE SCREENING TOOLS WILL ALLOW FOR EARLY INTERVENTIONS. ARE POTENTIALLY IMPROVING- EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS IN THE LONG RUN AND EVEN POTENTIALLY PREVENTING SOME STUDENTS FROM HAVING TO BE REFERRED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. THIS OVERALL OBJECTIVE- SEEMS REASONABLE TO US- BUT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL. FRANKLY WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE I TO DATE THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HASN'T SET STATUTORY- GUIDELINES ARE FRAMEWORK AROUND THE INITIATIVE IT'S REALLY BEEN DRIVEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE UNIVERSITY. AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WITHOUT SOME GUIDELINES THE LEGISLATURE COULD RUN THE RISK OF FACING UP UNLESS YOU LIVE WITH. A GROWING SCOPE AND GROWING COSTS THAT IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY INTEND TO COMMIT TO IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- YOU CAN TURN TO PAGE TWENTY ONE THE FIGURE ON THAT. IT SHOWS HOW THE CENTER WOULD BE- SPEND THE FUNDS AND EVEN SUSPENDED YOUR PLAN- YOU KNOW THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A BIT OF A BROAD IN SCOPE- THE- PLAN IS TO ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITY TO THE- ABSURD EXISTING TOOLS IN PLACE. AND THEN ALSO TO. FUND OTHER ACTIVITIES LIKE BASIC RESEARCH. OUR SECOND CONCERN IS THE ADMINISTRATION TO DATE HASN'T PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE A LONG TERM PLAN TO SCALE- THE- POLLS. THE LEGISLATURE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT THE LONG TERM PLAN IS TO. IMPLEMENT THE CENTERS SCHOOLS STATEWIDE- AND ALSO DISCUSS UNIT COSTS WITH FURTHER DEVELOPMENT WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS. FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE RECOMMEND OF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THIS INITIATIVE TO PROVIDE SOME STATUTORY GUIDANCE AND ALSO ADOPTS- REPORTING. ON TO GET SOME OF THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO I CAN MAKE. MORE INFORMED DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEN WILL GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. I WILL REVIEW THE PROPOSALS AND THE ORDER THAT THEY APPEAR IN YOUR AGENDA. STARTING WITH FIREARMS RESEARCH. FIREARMS ARE HEALTH CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONE CALIFORNIA AND DIED EVERY THREE HOURS FROM GUN VIOLENCE. IN TWENTY NINETEEN ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL 200-090-0405 PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DIED FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS. WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE GUNSHOT WOUNDS ARE LEAST LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. TO ADDRESS THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THE LEGISLATURE CODIFIED THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER AT UC DAVIS AS AN ACADEMIC AND POLICY RESEARCH CENTER. THE CENTERS AREAS OF ACTIVITY INCLUDE RESEARCH ASSISTANTS THE POLICY MAKERS TRAINING AND EDUCATION FOR RESEARCHERS PRACTITIONERS AND THE PUBLIC. A MEDICAL AND HEALTH PROVIDER EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAM AND AN OPTIONAL GRANT PROGRAMS TO FACILITATE RESEARCH BY OTHERS. THE CENTERS BALLPOINT PROJECT HAS DEVELOPED A CURRICULUM TO TEACH MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ABOUT FIREARM INJURY PREVENTION THE CENTER IS NOW DISSEMINATING THIS CURRICULUM AND EVALUATING ITS EFFECTIVENESS. FIRST OF CALIFORNIA REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE TWO MILLION PROPOSED TO CONTINUE THIS CRITICAL WORK. NOW MOVING ON TO THE DYSLEXIA CENTER THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TEN MILLION FOR TO UCSF DYSLEXIA CENTER TO CONDUCT TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AND BUILD ON THE CAPACITY OF SCIENCE TO DEVELOP ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION PRACTICES FOR CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA. THE CENTER IS DEVELOPING A TOOL CALLED MULTITUDES THAT WILL PROVIDE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY INCLUSIVE SCIENCE BASED ASSESSMENT OF YOUNG CHILDREN FOR DYSLEXIA. BEST PRACTICES HAVE TESTED CHILDREN SORRY FAST PRACTICES I'VE TESTED CHILDREN IN THIRD GRADE OR LATER ONLY AFTER IT THEY DEVELOP NOTICEABLE LEARNING DIFFICULTIES AND THEN ONLY IN ENGLISH. AT THIS POINT MANY CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA HAVE ALREADY FALLEN BEHIND IN LEARNING UNLESS AND HER SPECIAL INSTRUCTION CLASSROOM MULTITUDES PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A DIGITAL PLATFORM TOOL THAT TEACHERS CAN OPERATE WITH OUR SPECIALIST PRESENT THE SCREENING WILL TAKE TWENTY MINUTES WITH A SECOND TWENTY MINUTES SCREENING FOR CHILDREN WHO STRUGGLE WITH THE FIRST STEP. THE SYSTEM SCREENS KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE STUDENTS TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF RISK FOR LEARNING CHALLENGES BEFORE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE FAILURE SCHOOLS CAN BEGIN EARLY INTERVENTION BEFORE THE CHILD FALLS BEHIND OR HAS TO BE. PLACED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING. OUR TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE RESEARCH AND PREVENTION TOBACCO ACT. PROP FIFTY SIX ALLOCATES FORTY MILLION ANNUALLY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR STATE WIDE MEDICAL RESIDENCY GRANT PROGRAM. PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUES HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF THE FORTY MILLION GOAL AND THE STATE HAS STEPPED IN THE FUNDING GAP WITH STATE GENERAL FUND AND ENSURE THAT THE ANNUAL PROGRAM BUDGET REMAINS FORTY MILLION. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE PROP FIFTY SIX GME FUNDING PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MEDICAL RESIDENCY SLOTS STATEWIDE. BECAUSE DOCTORS TEND TO TAKE TEND TO STAY PRACTICING MEDICINE IN THE AREA WHERE THEY COMPLETED THEIR RESIDENCY IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER TO USE MEDICAL RESIDENCY POSITIONS TO ADDRESS DOCTOR SHORTAGES. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATUR CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE STATE GENERAL FUND TOP OFF FOR THE PROP FIFTY SIX GME FUNDING. TO FORTY MILLION. AND VERY QUICKLY I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR UC REGENTS BUDGET REQUEST NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. FIRST THE STUDENT ACADEMIC PREPARATION AN EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS OR STATE PROGRAM PROVIDES A THROUGH G. COURSES THE STUDENTS WHOSE HIGH SCHOOLS DO NOT OFFER A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THOSE COURSES. IN ADDITION AP COURSES SUMMER ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND MENTORING ARE OFFERED TO ENCOURAGE HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO ATTEND A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. WE ARE REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THESE PROGRAMS AT A TIME OF SIGNIFICANT LEARNING IMPACTS AND LOW INCOME DISTRICT. THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THE PANDEMIC GENERATION DOES NOT LOSE OUT ON HIGHER EDUCATION. SECOND WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SIX MILLION FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH SERVICES AND REQUEST YOUR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OR SOME OTHER VULNERABLE STUDENTS. FIVE MILLION FOUR ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND FOUR MILLION FOR CARCERAL SYSTEM IMPACTED STUDENTS. THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW CAMPUSES TO ESTABLISH DEDICATED PROGRAMS FOR ADVISING AND STUDENT SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST FOUR MILLION ONGOING FOR TWO UC CANCER CONSORTIUM FOR UNIFIED STRATEGY TO LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE STRENGTH AND SCALE OF THE UC SYSTEM. TO IMPROVE CANCER CARE AND PATIENT ACCESS AND BETTER SERVE THE DIVERSE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA. THE CANCER CENTER WOULD PROVIDE CANCER DATABASE FOR PRECISION ONCOLOGY ESTABLISHED CLINICAL TRIALS CREATE TEAMS FOR DISEASE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES AND OFFER SECOND OPINIONS TO PATIENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU- LET ME JUST SAY TWO THINGS THE ONE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK WAS ANSWERED IN THE UC PROPOSAL ABOUT WHAT ITEMS WERE NOT. ARE INDEED JANUARY TENTH BUDGET THAT WERE PRIORITIES OF THE UNIVERSITY. AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT NOON TODAY'S I'M MEETING WITH THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS AT TWELVE FIFTEEN AND SO I EXPECT TO HEAR. ABOUT THOSE WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND SECOND LET ME JUST NOTE THAT OUR KNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DYSLEXIA RESEARCH PROPOSAL TO THE GOVERNOR SO ARE WE ARE WHERE FACTORED WE WILL LOOK AT THESE PROPOSAL SETTING FORWARD LET ME ASK YOU FOR A- IF SENATOR CHOI BOGUE HAS ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ON. SHE HAS NONE THE SENATOR MEN LEFT NONE FOR ME SO GOING TO THANK BUT LET ME THANK THE PANEL OF THE- YOU'RE NOT GOING AWAY. A. N. AND WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL PANELISTS FOR THE NEXT ONE WE ARE MOVING TO THE- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES ITEM IT IS OVERSIGHT. THE FIRST BOSS SPEAKER WILL BE THE L. A. O. THE SECOND WILL BE- OF CITY OF FROM. OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE THIRD WILL BE GLENN GLENDA HERMISTON WHO'S THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR AGRICULTURE NATURAL RESOURCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN BRIAN RUTLEDGE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND LET ME JUST SAY TWO THINGS BEFORE WE GO TO THE PANELISTS IN THAT ORDER. ONE IS THAT WE DID A MAJOR AUGMENTATION LAST YEAR. IN THE BUDGET TO ATTEMPT TO RESTORE AND REHABILITATE COOPERATIVE AGRICULTURAL XTENSION ACROSS THE STATE. THEN PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS OVERSIGHT HEARINGS TO HEAR FOR THE PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THAT BUDGET ITEM FROM LAST YEAR. AND SECONDLY THERE THERE WAS A REPORT DONE BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ON THIS GENERAL SUBJECT WHICH I KNOW WILL BE PART OF THIS SO WE WILL HEAR THAT AS WELL. SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE. FROM THE L. A. L. THIRTY TWO THIRTY- ITEM I THOUGHT I WOULD. START BY FIRST PROVIDING SOME BASIC BACKGROUND ABOUT THE- PROGRAMS IN QUESTION AND THEN. I MOVED TO THE- RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. WE DESCRIBED IN OUR SPECIAL REPORT THAT THE CHARGES MENTIONED- WE FEEL. OF KEEPING THIS VERY BRIEF RECOGNIZING THE LIMITED TIME OF THE COMMITTEE. JUST TO INTRODUCE THE PROGRAMS VERY QUICKLY I USUALLY HAS TWO KEY PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUES THE FIRST IS CALLED THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS THIS PROVIDES BASIC RESEARCH. ON THAT THREE UC CAMPUSES ON AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUES. AND THE SECOND PROGRAM IS CALLED COOPERATIVE EXTENSION THIS IS MORE ENGAGED IN TRANSLATIONAL APPLIED RESEARCH AND ALSO DIRECT OUTREACH- AND- CONDUCT THESE ACTIVITIES ACROSS MANY COMMUNITY BASED SITES AND ON UC CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE AGRICULTURE EXPERIMENT STATION IS REALLY FOCUSED ON DOING THAT FOUNDATIONAL RESEARCH DISCOVERY AND THE COOPERATIVE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION TURN TRANSLATING THAT INTO SEVENTEEN DISSEMINATING THAT INFORMATION INTO THEIR BROADER COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE. I'M I'M JUST ANOTHER ASPECT ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS TO KEEP IN MIND OF THEIR FOCUS BROADLY ON AGRICULTURAL NATURAL RESOURCES BUT ENGAGE IN MANY DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES RANGING FROM BASIC RESEARCH TO. RE DEVELOPING NEW INVENTIONS TO PROVIDING WORKSHOPS TO FARMERS TO PROVIDING NUTRITION EDUCATION TO CALIFORNIA AND ADULTS AND STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. I'M SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED IN THESE PROGRAMS. THE PROGRAMS OVERSEEN BY THE U. C. DIVISION OF AGRICULTURAL NATURAL RESOURCES YOU'LL HEAR US REFER TO IT THROUGHOUT THE ITEM AS YOU SEE A IN OUR- IN PRACTICE YOU SEE IN OUR PHONE WAS YOU WERE OBVIOUSLY LISTENING TO OUR HEARING YESTERDAY WHERE WE WON'T WAR AGAINST ACRONYMS NOT BEING DEFINED BEFORE THEY WERE USED. SO LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU FOR DOING THAT WITHOUT HAVING TO BE PROMPTED BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY DON'T WORK FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. R. I'M AFRAID THAT JUST FROZE HIM WITH CFO HE HE ON FREEZES HERE. I THINK THE MERE MENTION OF AN ACRONYM BOB HAS FROZEN THE SYSTEM. WELL LET'S DO THIS- LET'S LET HIM SEE IF HE CAN REJOIN US ON FROZEN AND MOVE TO A TO SAY HOWEVER THÀNH AND FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S OUR SECOND SPEAKER WILL GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO CLOSE IF HE REJOINS LIKE TO TURN DISCUSSION OF THIS ITEM OVER TO VICE PRESIDENT PLAN TO HUMISTON. I THANK YOU SAY HOT MAN THANK YOU CHAIR LETTER TO MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THANKS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY AND FOR THE CONTINUED SUPPORT YOU HAVE SHOWN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR INVESTMENT IN UC ANR AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR PROGRESS TO RECRUIT AND HIRE UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SCIENTIST. THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS HAVE BEEN REMARKABLY BUSY AS WE WORK SWIFTLY TO POST AND FILL POSITIONS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ENHANCE OUR REACH AND DELIVER SCIENCE BASED INFORMATION CURRICULUM PROGRAMMING AND SOLUTIONS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. AS PART OF THE LAND GRANT PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE STATE. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO MOORLACH. UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS HAVE ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS THROUGH INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PEST MANAGEMENT. FOOD SECURITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HEALTHEQUITY AND BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS. IN ADDITION TO OUR NETWORK OF RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AS WELL AS JUST BEING DESCRIBED UC ANR ALSO DELIVERS EXPERTISE THROUGH THIRTEEN DIFFERENT INSTITUTES AND STATEWIDE PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS THAT HELP DELIVER PROGRAMS LIKE FOUR H. YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND MASTER GARDENERS. A FEW UNIQUE EXAMPLES OF IMPACT DELIVERED BY THE UC ANR RESEARCHERS INCLUDE. NEW SOFTWARE AND PHONE APPS SUCH AS CROP MANAGE WHICH HELPS GROWERS TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WATER AND NITROGEN FERTILIZER USED WHILE STILL REMAINING PRODUCTIVITY. YOU DISSIPATE IN OUR FOUR H. PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE MORE LIKELY TO PURSUE CAREERS IN STEM. TWICE AS LIKELY TO GRADUATE COLLEGE AND MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE. IN COMMUNITY ENRICHMENT PROJECTS. PROGRAM FINDINGS FROM TWENTY TWO. INDICATE THAT NUTRITION. PROTEST REPORTED AN AVERAGE MONTHLY FOOD COST SAVINGS OF OVER FIFTY EIGHT DOLLARS WHICH COLLECTIVELY SAVED LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA FAMILIES OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. TO ENHANCE PROGRAM DELIVERY WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO BETTER LEVERAGE STATE FUNDING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE RATIO IS TWO POINT FOUR DOLLARS GENERATED PER EACH STATE DOLLAR WE RECEIVE. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE ADDED MULTIPLE CO FUNDED POSITIONS AND EXPANDED PARTNERSHIPS FOR EXAMPLE BY HIRING ADDITIONAL CLIMATE SMART EDUCATION AGRICULTURE EDUCATORS THANK CREATING THE NEW UC ORGANIC AGRICULTURE INSTITUTE. THANKS TO THE ONGOING AUGMENTATION OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET FOR YOU SEE A AND R. WE HAVE ACTED QUICKLY TO REBUILD THE UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION FOOTPRINT. ALL THE POSITIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE STILL THE FOCAL POINT OF THE HIRING PLAN WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A SEPARATE PROCESS TO ENSURE IDENTIFICATION OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ACADEMIC POSITIONS ACROSS ALL DISCIPLINARY IS FOR TODAY AND INTO THE FUTURE. THIS INVOLVED COMMUNICATING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS AND PRIORITIZE NEXT ROUND OF FIRING OF NOTE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE OPEN SUBMITTALS FOR PLACEMENT OF UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SPECIALIST. WHO ALL TEN CAMPUSES. TODAY ELEVEN EXTENSION ADVISORS AND SPECIAL HAVE BEEN A HIGH AND ARE IN FEEL CURRENTLY UNDER RECRUITMENT AND EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER BEFORE JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. YOU SEE A IN OUR WILL BE ANNOUNCING OVER FORTY ADDITIONAL NEW ADVISOR POSITIONS UP TO TWENTY SPECIALIST POSITIONS LATER THIS SPRING WE'VE EXPANDED RECRUITING CAPACITY AND ENHANCED HIRING PRACTICES TO MEET. THE EVOLVING DEMANDS OF THE JOB MARKET AND ENSURE SUCCESS. YOU SEE A AND R'S COMMITTED TO HIRING A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE THAT REFLECTS THE TOP TALENT NECESSARY TO SOLVE SOCIETAL PROBLEMS. WE WILL PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH A BUDGET AND IMPACT REPORT LATER THIS SPRING. IN CLOSING THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO TALK ABOUT UC ANR BEEN CLOSE TO MY HEART. IN FACT THREE OF FOUR H. PLAQUE YOU SEE BEHIND ME WAS A GIFT FROM MY FATHER AT CHRISTMAS THIS PAST YEAR. IT WAS ATTACHED TO OUR HOUSE WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND FOR H. AND I ATTRIBUTE MY FOR EACH EXPERIENCE LARGELY TO WHERE I AM TODAY. I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN THE MISSION OF COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND ITS ABILITY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE MANY CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA. AS WE ENHANCE OUR PROGRAMS AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE BEST SERVING ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE. UC ANR I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR OUR IN A MOMENT I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MR CONSTANT TOURISTS- TO SEE IF HE WANTS TO FINISH HIS COMMENTS BUT I CAN'T RESIST ANSWER QUESTIONS NOT WHERE WAS THE- FOR H. PLAQUE WHERE DID WHERE DID YOU GROW UP WHERE THAT. PRODUCT FOR MY FAMILY'S CATTLE RANCH IN SOUTHWEST COLORADO. WHICH MY FATHER IS STILL RUNNING. THAT'S GREAT WELL. SORRY WE DON'T HAVE MORE TIME I'D ASK LOCK. ABOUT THE SO. LET'S GO ON TO MY TRUMP TOURISTS. MY APOLOGIES TO THE CAN AND APPRECIATION FOR VICE ON THE STAND FOR MAKING UP WHERE I WORRY I. WAS EMCEEING AN EVENT RECENTLY REMOTE WAY AND IT DROPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EVENT SO I TOTALLY APPRECIATE WHAT WHAT HAPPENED A PLEASE FINISH YOUR COMMENTS. ARE YOU IT SOUNDED LIKE- ADVICE PRESIDENT HOMESTEAD PROVIDED MORE DETAIL ON THE PROGRAM TOO SO I THINK WE CAN SKIP RIGHT FOR THE SECOND TIME RIGHT TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS- THANK YOU SEE OUR SPECIAL REPORT. THE REASON WHY WE WERE- WE UNDERTOOK IT WAS ME- WANTED TO SERVE BETTER ASSESS HOW THE STATE MOVING FORWARD CO TO DROUGHT- BUDGET FOR. ARE YOU SEE A IN OUR AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT'S ONLY RECENTLY STARTED A LINE ITEM BUDGETING. FOR THE DIVISION. AND SO WHAT ARE YOU CAN A RIGHT. ON PAGE FOUR. OF YOUR CHEN. AND I IT SOUNDS LIKE I THINK I'LL SPEND THE MOST TIME ON OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION GIVEN THAT THE AGENDA ASKS US TO ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE ON IT AND THEN ALL OF. LEAVE THE OTHER TWO RECOMMENDATIONS JUST AT A HIGH LEVEL. THE AVAILABLE FOR Q. NA- EACH STORE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE INCORPORATE STATE FUNDING FOR THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION PROGRAMMED INTO THE LINE ITEM. CURRENTLY THE LINE ITEM PROVIDES FUNDING FOR YOU SEE A IN OUR WHICH- REALLY ESSENTIAL EFFECTIVELY PROVIDES FUNDING FOR COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. YOU SEE STILL HAS FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE FUNDING FOR THE EXPERIMENT STATION PROGRAM. OUR REASONING WE HAVE TWO REASONS WHY WE THINK THIS APPROACH WOULD MAKE SENSE LOOKING FORWARD. THE FIRST IS IT WOULD IT- AND- MORE TRANSPARENCY AND CLARIFY HOW MUCH THE FUNDING IS GOING FOR THE EXPERIMENT STATIONS. AT THE% MOMENT THERE IS A LOT LESS INFORMATION AVAILABLE OF. THE LEGISLATURE ON THE EXPERIMENT STATIONS BUDGET RELATIVE TO THE- MUCH MORE CONSIDERABLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON YOU SEE AN ARTS BUDGET. WE THINK WE'RE GOING FORWARD THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE- JUST BETTER CLARITY AS TO HOW MUCH FUNDING IS PROVIDING FOR THE PROGRAM. THE REASON IS WE THINK WOULD ALLOW A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSISTENCY IN HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE BUDGETED- CURRENTLY THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN TREATED A LITTLE. SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY IN TERMS OF THEIR OF A BUDGETS. UNTIL RECENTLY COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND THE FACT OF WHERE YOU SEE A AND R'S STATE FUNDING HAD BEEN. SOMEWHAT FLAT AND ACT AND THE DURING THE PANDEMIC WAS ACTUALLY PRODUCED BY THE STATE- AS AS- THE CHAIR NOTED- THAT BLASTERS BUDGET- REPLACE OF THAT REDUCTION AND PROVIDED A- NONTRADITIONAL AUGMENTATION TO HIRE MORE STAFF STATION PROGRAM HAS RECEIVED A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS EACH YEAR IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSITY WAS LARGELY PRODUCTIVE FROM ADOPTIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A CLEAR BOB POLICY RATIONALE FOR THIS DIFFERENCE IN TREATMENT IT'S BASICALLY REFLECTING CAN YOU SEE THE CURRENT BUDGET PRACTICES. WE THINK I KEEPING OF THE FUNDS TOGETHER WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK MORE HOLISTICALLY AT BOTH PROGRAMS AND CONSIDER FUNDING FOR BOTH PROGRAMS NEED MOVING FORWARD AND HOW WAS YOUR WAY THE TRADEOFFS OF THE FUNDING MORE RESEARCH. VERSUS APPLIED RESEARCH NOT REACH. I'M SURE THAT YOU RECOMMEND ARE REALLY AROUND JUST ADDING MORE ACCORDING THE AIM OF IMPROVING- THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO BUDGET. FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND MOVING FORWARD. AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THIS YEAR'S BUDGET DOESN'T PROPOSE A CALL UP FOR. YOU SEE A R. AND REALLY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE ISN'T GETTING IS A REGULAR REPORTING ON ITS PROJECTED COST PRESSURES AND AVAILABLE NONSTATE FUNDS TO OFFSET SOME OF THOSE COST PRESSURES. THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HAS VERY WILL BE SAYS TO ADJUST ITS BUDGET MOVING FORWARD TO GETTING SOME MORE RECORDING UP FRONT ON ITS BUDGET. AS WELL AS SOME ADDITIONAL REPORTING ON ITS OUTCOMES COULD YOU KNOW HELP INFORM LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS WITH THE BALL. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU BRIAN RELIGIOUS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE MORE TO ADD IN TERMS OF UPDATING BUT WILL NOTE THAT WE RECOGNIZE IT. AND APPRECIATE THE IMPACT OF YOU SEEN ARE INCLUDING THE FACT THAT IT'S VERY BROAD. CROSS THE STREET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. NINETY I CAN'T TELL WHO'S COMMENTING I THINK THERE IS A WAY INTO THE FUTURE IS AN EMPLOYEE OF UCLA AND ALL. WHO WHOEVER IT IS A- WELL LET ME MOVE THROUGH SOME QUESTIONS QUICKLY HERE AND- BOB LET ME ASK- MRS VIRTON AND A GRATUITOUS QUESTION OUT OF LAST YEAR BECAUSE LAST YEAR WE GOT TO POINT TO WHERE I ASKED THAT EVERY DOLLAR WE APPROPRIATED FOR THIS WAS GONNA GO TO THIS PURPOSES IS THAT ACTUALLY. HAPPENING NOW THAT WERE A YEAR AND- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER LAYERED- YES. ANR IS GETTING ALL OF THE MONEY THAT WAS APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEM. FOR THE PURPOSE SAYS- THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THANK YOU REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BURYING WITH ME ON THAT QUESTION. AND LET ME ASK A OF A- OF VICE PRESIDENT HONEST AND- ONE QUESTION ARE YOU ACTUALLY PRESUME TO QUESTION OF MINE TO LINE OUT HOW MANY POSITIONS IN BED FILLED HOW MANY RECRUITMENT. HOW MANY ARE GOING TO RECRUITMENT THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL AND IT IS THOSE NUMBERS THAT OVER TIME WE WILL BE VERY INTERESTED IN. AND I KNOW THIS FROM ONE OF THE LOCAL ONES IN MY DISTRICT. TO THE NUMBERS THAT YOU OUTLINED COVER FILLING IN FOR RETIREMENTS SO WE'RE NOT JUST. FILLING THE NEEDS WERE MET BEFORE FILLING BEHIND PEOPLE THAT MIGHT. BE RETIRING IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS. SO AS WE FORWARD TO- AND THERE ARE RETIREMENTS THE SALARY SAVINGS FROM THOSE RETIREMENTS WILL GO INTO- OUR OUR ACADEMIC REVERSION POOL. AND TO THE DEGREE WE CAN- WE WILL HIRE WE DO UTILIZE OUR POSITION CALL HOWEVER TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE HIRE WORKERS WE ARE STAYING WITH WHAT ARE THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF AN ORGANIZATION WHERE YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT WORK WITH US TWENTY THIRTY EVEN FORTY YEARS WHEN WE HAVE SOME FOLKS THAT LONG. IS THAT- IN A CHANGING SITUATION SUCH AS CALIFORNIA. SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON A CROP IN ONE COUNTY FOR FORTY YEARS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CROSSES AND EVEN GROWN IN THAT COUNTY ANYMORE. SO THAT'S WHY WE DO OUR POSITION CALL PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SERVING FOR TODAY'S AND TOMORROW'S NEEDS TO HAVE IT AND LET ME SAY I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE I SUPPORT THAT. I JUST KNOW THAT IN ONE OF THE COUNTIES IN MY DISTRICT. ARE ARE THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND ALL BUT TWO WERE RETIREMENT AGE AND SO THEY WERE FREAKING OUT DID THAT THOSE POSITIONS WON'T BE FILLED. AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT A CROP ISN'T GROWN ANYMORE AND SOMEBODY'S ROTATED OUT FOR THAT TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE I THINK IT'S JUST MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S- THERE'S STILL ONE BEHIND IN THE MIDST OF THIS. AND THEN LET ME ASK A QUESTION A FINANCE. FIRM ONE OF THE REASONS THAT. THAT WE DID THIS RESTORATION LAST YEAR. WAS IT WAS AS DALY- JUST SAID THERE WERE A NUMBER OF YEARS IN WHICH FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM WAS FLAT. AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD. OF THIS YEAR FINANCE DID NOT PROPOSE A COLA A AND I CAN IMAGINE THAT IT'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE FULLY SPENT BUT- IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE IT'S A REAL PRECEDENT OR COULD WE JUST NOT FALL BEHIND AGAIN AND- SO. NOW THAT I'VE STATED A VERY FIRM A PEN AND PUSHED YOU INTO THE CORNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT. I WANT TO CHURCH A YOU. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE A COLA FOR YOU SEE IN OUR- THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE STAND RIGHT NOW. OKAY MORE THAN I WILL SAY I STAND DIFFERENTLY SO I HOPE BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE MARKET MAY REVISE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A CALL US SO WE JUST DON'T FALL BEHIND ONCE AGAIN AND EVEN IF. IT TURNS OUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND ALL OF THIS YEAR'S MONEY BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG TO RECRUIT AND GET COMPLETELY OP I WOULD NOT WANT TO LOSE TO THE GAIN AND PURCHASING POWER PARTICULARLY SINCE WE HAVE INFLATION AGAIN SO I JUST HOPE THAT A CALL WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE- IN THE MAY REVISED AND NOT LET ME GO TO THE ONE ISSUE OF THE HOUR THAT THAT- CAME OUT OF THE L. A- OFF. OF- REPORT. AND THAT'S THE- FIRM. THERE THERE'S THE ISSUE OF THE AGRICULTURAL STATIONS AND AS I UNDERSTAND THEY REPORT DIRECTLY. TO THE PRESIDENT IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THEN WE HAVE. COOPER VEGAS TENSION WHICH WE'VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING THAT IS WITH WITH IN. UC ANR- IN LET ME S. C. L. A. O. Y. U. OF RECOMMENDED- ARMS MOVING THE AGRICULTURAL STATE OF STATIONS TO AND ARE. YOUR RECOMMENDATION ISN'T NECESSARILY TO CHANGE THE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF AN R. OR THE EXPERIMENT STATIONS FOR KIDS BY CHANGE THE LEADERSHIP OF IT IT'S TO ARE CATEGORICALLY- PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE EXPERIMENT STATIONS. LIKE IT DOES FOR A AND ARE SO YOU KNOW THAT COULD LOOK LIKE- A SPECIFIC LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET WITH A SCHEDULE ONE DAY NOTING FUNDS FOR COOPER MAKES CENTURY C. A. R. AND ANOTHER DENOTING FUNDS FOR EXPERIMENT STATIONS. AND SO IT OUR OUR RIGHT HERE IS MORE AROUND- CLARIFYING THE MODESTY FUNDING THAT'S GONG TO THE EXPERIMENT STATIONS. KIND OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THE LIMITED INFORMATION WHAT THE STATE HAS ON EXPERIMENT STATIONS RELATIVE TO YOU SEE A IN OUR- AND THEN ALSO. OF ALLOWING FOR SOME MORE CONSISTENT- BUDGETING MOVING FORWARD ENSURING THAT IF ONE PROGRAM'S GETTING LOCAL- THE OTHER PROGRAM IS OR IF. IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE SAME AUGMENTATION THERE SORT OF OUR RATIONALE BEHIND IT IS. JUST ARE REFLECTING- YOU SEE BUDGET PRACTICES THAT DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE A CLEAR POLICY BASIS. THANK YOU NOW LET ME ASK OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO COMMENT ON THAT AND FRANKLY. I HATE TO DO THIS TO YOU- SAY- BUT- I THINK THIS IS AT A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PAY GRADE THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF. A AND R. BECAUSE IT'S A DECISIONS PROBABLY ORGANIZATIONAL THAT WOULD BE MADE WITHIN UC. YOUR DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT IN RESPONSE. TO THE L. A. O.'S RECOMMENDATION OVER TO VICE PRESIDENT YOU MUST IN PLACE. OKAY BUT SHE CAN'T SAY IT'S ABOVE HER PAY GRADE. OKAY MADAM VICE PRESIDENT OVER TO YOU ELSE TIME AND ATTENTION TO LOOKING AT OUR PROGRAMS AND THE REPORT OF THE UC SYSTEM IS NOT IN SUPPORT OF MOVING THE A YES BUDGET INTO THE A AND R. LINE ITEM AND THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND THAT EACH CAMPUS ITSELF IS BEST POSITIONED TO UNDERSTAND ITS BASIC COMPLIED RESEARCH CONTINUE ON. BASED UPON THAT CAMPUS IS SPECIFIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND PERSONNEL STRENGTHS- REALLY FOR THE CONTINUING TO WORK WHILE THE AG EXPERIMENT STATION SCIENTISTS COLLABORATE VERY CLOSELY WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS ON THAT CAMPUS AND THE CAMPUS CAN BEST ORGANIZE THAT BUT WE ARE VERY OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE L. A. ON THE COMMITTEE ON OTHER SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST BEFORE WE MOVE OFF OF THAT TOPIC SIR ANYBODY ELSE THAT WISHES TO COMMENT ON THAT IT DIDN'T COMMENT YET. OR WISHES TO COMMENT. SEEING NO ONE LET ME ASK US SENATE ROADSHOW BOGUE SHE HAS NO COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AND SO LET ME SAY A BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS ITEM THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S PARTICIPATION TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS THAT IS BEING MADE ON THIS AND I THINK IT IS REALLY WELL REGARDED ACROSS THE STATE- D. IN THIS BUSINESS YOU DIDN'T. USE YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET THANKED FOR THINGS AND WHEN I RETURNED FROM THE SUMMER RECESS LAST YEAR DOOR HUGE STACK OF THANK YOU CARDS ON MY DESK FOR WHAT WE DID WITH YOU SEE AN ART LAST YEAR AND SO- HOPE THAT THIRD CALL ISSUES ADDRESSED WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE. LOOSE PACE I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO MOVE A PATIENT FILLING THOSE POSITIONS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THE CONTINUED REPORTS ON THE PROGRESS AND I THANK EVERYBODY FOR- PARTICIPATING TODAY. OR WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR AS YOU NUMBER SIX IMPLEMENTATION OF PREVIOUS BUDGET ACT AGREEMENTS IT'S AN OVERSIGHT ITEM. AND THE ONLY- PANELIST IS A SAY A FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LET ME RECOGNIZE HER RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU CHAIR LAYERED. THE COMMITTEE AGENDA OUTLINES MULTIPLE ISSUES RELATED BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M GOING TO TOUCH ON EACH OF THESE BRIEFLY IN THE ORDER THAT THEY APPEAR ON YOUR AGENDA. PLEASE FULLER ME IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO SKIP AHEAD AT ANY TIME. BEGINNING WITH YOU SEE I JUST HAVE TO SAY WE ARE ALL RUNNING REALLY SHORT ON TIME AND WANT TO ALLOW SOME TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT SO. WHAT WE DO THIS IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. ON YOUR POSITION THAT'S IN THE AGENDA REPORT WANTED TO DO THAT AND OTHERWISE. I WILL JUST MOVE DIRECTLY TO QUESTIONS. THIS VERY QUICKLY ON- NEW C. O. P. E. R. FUNDING HAVING RETURNED TO THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT. NOT ONLY IS THE TOTAL YOU SEE OP BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WITH THE SAME AS IT WAS IN NINETEEN TWENTY. BUT FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY NOT THE YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY RIGHT. JUST CHECK THIRTY. HERE TWENTY NINE STUDENTS NOT KEEPING UP WITH INFLATION. WE WOULD BE TROUBLE- THE REGENTS HAVE A TOTAL CAMPUS THAT MATCHES THE STATE LINE ITEM THANK YOU SEE OP HAD IN THE. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET OF. THE UC WE BUDGET TODAY IS NOT THE UC OP BUDGET OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN IMPORTANT CHANGES TO TRANSPARENCY DOCUMENTATION AND DECISION MAKING HAVE ÒN THESE REFORMS INCLUDE THE FORMATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF CHANCELLORS VICE CHANCELLORS OF FINANCE AND OTHER CAMPUS LEADERS WHO REVIEW YOU C. O. P. EXPENDITURES AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE PRESIDENT ON THE UC OP PROGRAMS AND EXPENDITURES. IN ADDITION YOU SEE OP HAS DEVELOPED A DOCTOR AND DOCUMENTED RESEARCH POLICY AND RESERVES ARE NOT REPORTED QUARTERLY TO THE UC REGENTS ALONG WITH THE BUDGET AND AMOUNTS TO ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. YOU C. O. P. IMPLEMENTED AND ENTIRE NEW BUDGET AND PLANNING SYSTEM COMPLETED A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF EACH YOU SEE OP FUND AND ITS USE THERE WAS ALSO AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS TO DOCUMENT EACH PROGRAM AN INITIATIVE AND PROVIDE CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF EACH. THE UC CHANCELLORS REQUESTED THE RETURN TO THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT AND THEY DECIDE FOR THEIR CAMPUS WHICH FUNDING SOURCES THEY WILL USE TO PAY THE ASSESSMENT THE CAMPUSES WILL REPORT ON THE FUNDING SOURCES THEY USED FOR THE ASSESSMENT AFTER THE FISCAL YEAR BOOKS ARE CLOSED. THE UC REGENTS WILL APPROVE A PRELIMINARY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IT WAS STILL BE BUDGET AD MAKE THE REGION'S WILL ACCRUE PROGRAIS FINAL USED TO BE BUDGET IN JULY- DUMP WILL REFLECT ANY LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. ON THE UC OF THE BUDGET. AND THEN THIS. BEFORE WERE. TO VERY QUICKLY ON THE PROGRAM- I WANTEDTO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE ESTABLISHING THE TWO NEW PRIME PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. AND THE BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS PRIME WILL EXPAND TO NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS SYSTEM WIDE. UP WE RECEIVED THE TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PRIME PROGRAM AFTER THE- ADMISSIONS PROCESS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR HAD ALREADY CLOSED SO THE NEXT COHORT WILL BE ADMITTED THIS SPRING WILL START WITH THESE FUNDS. ON THE EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR PROVIDING THESE FUNDS FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS WE HAD MANY STUDENTS WHO HAD THEIR INCOME OR THEIR FAMILY'S INCOME IMPACTED DURING COED- THIS IS ARE INFLUENCED BY A FEDERAL ACTION IS WEALTHY AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT PASSED IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THEY ARE BY INCLUDED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR MILLION AND EMERGENCY STUDENT FINANCIAL AID FOR UC'S STUDENTS. THEY ARE ALSO HAD A REQUIREMENT THAT ALL THE FUNDS HAD TO BE SPENT WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OR ANY UNEXPECTED BALANCES WOULD HAVE TO BE RETURNED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE ACT UC CAMPUSES PRIMARILY PROVIDED ARBOR FUNDS AS EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS. CAMPUSES WILL MAKE AN APPLICATION FOR STATE EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE FOR TO STUDENTS IN SPRING QUARTER AND BEYOND UNTIL THE FIFTEEN MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED OUT TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. AND ON THE DUAL ADMISSIONS PATHWAY I WANTED TO MENTION THAT- WE WILL BEGIN ADMISSIONS TO END OF THIS PROGRAM- DURING THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AS REQUIRED BY THE PASSED AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION AB ONE THIRTY TWO. BUDGET TRAILER BILL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON THOSE STUDENTS WHO APPLY TO YOU SEE WHO HAVE THE MINIMUM HIGH SCHOOL GPA OF THREE POINT OH BUT WHO HAVE NOT FULFILLED NECESSARY A THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSIONS. IN THE ADMISSIONS CYCLE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS WITH HIGH SCHOOL GPAS OF THREE POINT OH OR ABOVE APPLY TO YOU SEE WHO HAD NOT COMPLETED A THROUGH G. ABOUT HALF OF THOSE APPLICANTS. IDENTIFIED AS A MEMBER OF AN UNDER REPRESENTED GROUP. AND SO IT IS THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAVE THAT- GPA BUT NOT THE A THROUGH G. COURSES THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON. AND WE'LL HAVE MORE TO REPORT TO YOU AND FUTURE YEARS- THE CAL ISI'S WERE PROVIDED WITH ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT IS ACRONYM MEANS INSTITUTES FOR SCIENCE AND INNOVATION IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT SIR CALIFORNIA INSTITUTES ON SCIENCE AND INNOVATION- I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN NOTE OF YOUR YOUR NOTES TO CHASE AND BUT I DIDN'T WANT MY COMPUTER TO FREE. SO I HAD TO SKIP OVER EXPLAINING ORGANIZATION AT THE- BUT THE FUNDS WILL USED TO CREATE A ENTER AND FELL EXPERI WHERE STUDENTS WILL WORK IN SMALL TEAMS WITH A MENTOR TO CONDUCT RESEARCH- AND WORK WITH A COMPANY THAT WILL PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS- AND DO AND ENTERPRENEURS EFFORTS- THESE OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE IMMERSIVE SUMMER EXPERIENCES NEAR ALONG MENTOR INTERNSHIPS AND A TWO WEEK INTENSIVE CREATOR WORKSHOP. WHICH IS PLANNED LATER TO BE DEVELOPED INTO CONTINUING EDUCATION CERTIFICATES- THEIR CALLOUS I ASIDE ARE COLLABORATING ACROSS CAMPUSES WITH MERCED RIVERSIDE IN SANTA CRUZ STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL SO WE ARE TAKING CARE TO SET UP. OPPORTUNITIES NEAR THOSE CAMPUSES SO ALL STUDENTS CAN CAN PARTICIPATE. AND MOVING ON TO SB EIGHT TWENTY THANK YOU SEE EMPLOYMENT AND CAPITAL OUTLAY- SB EIGHT TWENTY WAS A BUDGET TRAILER BILL OF TWENTY TWENTY REQUIRING TO UNIVERSITY TO CERTIFY THAT ALL CLEANING MAINTENANCE GROUNDS KEEPING FOOD SERVICE OR OTHER WORK TRADITIONALLY PERFORMED BY PERSONS WITH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SERVICE UNIT S. X. JOB CLASSIFICATIONS. SHALL BE PERFORMED ONLY FROM PLEASE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT EACH FACILITY IN WHICH THERE HAS BEEN A STATE FUNDED CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT. THE UNIVERSITY WAS ALSO REQUIRED TO CERTIFY RETROACTIVELY TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT THE WORK DESCRIBED ABOVE HAD BEEN PERFORMED EXCLUSIVELY BY EMPLOYEES AND THEY ASKED ME ASPECTS BARGAINING UNIT AT ALL TIMES SINCETHE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED STATE FUNDING FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY EXPENDITURE. OR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT. UNIVERSITY OF PER. A CERTIFICATION THE LEGISLATURE ON JUNE ELEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND A SUPPLEMENTAL CERTIFICATION ON SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. UNDER THE S. B. A. TWENTY REQUIREMENTS SIX UC LOCATION CERTIFIED THAT THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS UNDER STATUTE FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN THROUGH THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THOSE WERE C DAVIS UC IRVINE UC RIVERSIDE UC SAN DIEGO LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. LOCATIONS THAT NOTED SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE CONTRACTED SERVICES WERE USED IMPOSSIBILITIES THAT HAD RECEIVED STATE CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING SINCE JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. FOR UC BERKELEY UCLA UC MERCED UC SANTA BARBARA UC SANTA CRUZ UC SAN FRANCISCO AND UC AGRICULTUREAND NATURAL RESOURCES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE NON COMPLIANT CONTRACTS WERE REPORTED AS CLOSED. IT IN THAT LOCATION HAD ALREADY STOPPED USING THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS TO PERFORM THE SERVICES WITH THE WORK BEING SUBSEQUENTLY PERFORMED BY UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES. HI SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEARS HE PLANS TO SUBMIT UPDATED CERTIFICATIONS FOR ALL FACILITIES WITH COMPLETED PROJECTS THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND JUST A NOTE ON THE BILL CO COURT PROGRAM EXTENSION- THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN TWENTY TEN- BY AB FIFTY TWO BY CENTER PORTANTINO. OF IT CHARGES A TWO DOLLAR FEE ON BIRTH CERTIFICATE COPIES AND HAS AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. THERE IS A BUDGET. SORRY THERE'S A POLICY BILL THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY INTRODUCED SB EIGHT EIGHT THREE BY CENTER SPROSTON PORTANTINO. THAT WOULD EXTEND THIS PROGRAM TO TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- A FEW HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE DEAD AFTER A BABY IS BORN.BLOOD IS COLLECTED FROM THE UMBILICAL CORD AND PLACENTA NOPE BLOOD IS EVER TAKEN FROM THE BABY AND NO EMBRYOS. ARE INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM FACILITATES THE COLLECTION OF BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX THOUSAND UNIT COURTS OF BLOOD EACH YEAR OF WHICH ABOUT FIVE TO TEN PERCENT. OF OUR OF THE CONDITION THAT THEY CAN BE BANKED- FROM DAYS BLOOD COURTS STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS CAN BE PROVIDED TO RECIPIENTS. BUT THESE TRANSPLANT TRANSPLANT PATIENT AT SPECIFIC GENES THAT CAN BE INFLUENCED BY RACIAL AND ETHNIC ANCESTRY. THE RARER PATIENTS ANCESTRY TO MORE DIFFICULT IT CAN BE TO FIND AN APPROPRIATELY MATCH SUITABLE LIVING DONOR. THESE BLOOD CHORDS CAN BE USED TO TREAT OVER EIGHTY DISEASES INCLUDING LEUKEMIA LYMPHOMAS AND INHERITED IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS. I HAD AN EIGHT WITH WE ARE JUST REALLY RUNNING LATE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THAT WAS THE LAST ITEM SO THAT WAS THE LAST DAY AND I ONLY HAD ONE QUESTION AND WAS ON THAT ITEM. OF BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THAT A POLICY BILL BEEN INTRODUCED BUT I THINK IT'S THE PREFERENCE OF THE AUTHORED THAT IT BE DONE THROUGH THE BUDGET AND THE BUDGET ACT OF REQUIRED TO REPORT BY JANUARY FIRST AND I WAS WONDERING IF THAT REPORTED BEEN SUBMITTED. I WAS TOLD PRIVATE WE HADN'T BEEN BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW HAS IT BEEN SUBMITTED ALREADY. I BELIEVE THE REPORT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND I WILL GET YOU A COPY OF THAT GREAT I WILL I WILL GET EVERY COMMITTEE MEMBER A COPY OF THAT BECAUSE HOPEFULLY FINANCES LISTENING. THIS WOULD BE THE IDEAL PLACE TO JUST EXTEND TO SUNSET BASED ON THE REPORT IF THE REPORT SHOWS THAT THE PROGRAM IS DOING WHAT IT INTENDED. BUT OUR- YOU KNOW WE COULD BE GOOD TO GET A COPY OF THAT REPORT AND NO AND JUST HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY'S LISTENING AND TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT. LET ME ASK A SENATOR OTRO BLOQUE CENTER MEN HAD NO QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE OF DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I THINK BY QUESTION WAS- SIMILAR TO YOURS BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION- I THIS IS THE- I WAS A- THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THIS EXISTED IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS. IS THIS WHAT THE AWARENESS OF PARENTS ARE OF THE MOTHERS GIVING BIRTH. IT IS WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE MOTHERS GIVING BIRTH OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA DOES AUTOMATICALLY. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR- THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. WHERE THE PARENTS OF THE BABY. MUST PROVIDE PERMISSION TO HAVE THE BLOOD COLLECTED. PERFECT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU THAT COMPLETES OF THIS ITEM I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S SUPPORT DISSIPATION WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO OUR LAST ITEM ISSUE SEVEN STUDENT HOUSING ARE WITH SAY HA FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE SIDE OF. THANK YOU CHIRLA OR IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL TRY TO MOVE FAST. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZES THAT AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING IS NECESSARY FOR CONTAINING THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND THAT MAKING FOR AFFORDABLE SAFE AND CONVENIENT HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS. IS NECESSARY TO REACH OUR GOAL OF DEBT FREE EDUCATION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE UNIVERSITY STARTED THE STUDENT HOUSING INITIATIVE TO EXPAND AVAILABLE CAMPUS HOUSING SINCE THAT TIME CAMPUSES HAVE COMPLETED. BETWEEN FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY SIX ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENT HOUSING BEDS ARE PLANNED. THESE NEWUNITS ARE PLANNED TO BE 10220% BELOW MARKET RATE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. STATUTE SPECIFIES THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE 20% OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM FUNDS. THIS WOULD MEAN THE UNIVERSITY COULD RECEIVE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION OF THE TOTAL TWO BILLION PROGRAM. ACCORDING TO STATUTE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE ON MARCH FIRST WHICH PROJECTS WILL RECEIVE FUNDING IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM. FOR THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING FROM WHICH THE UNIVERSITY ANTICIPATES RECEIVING ONE HUNDRED MILLION OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AVAILABLE UC CAMPUSES SUBMITTED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN STATE FUNDING REQUEST. IF APPROVED THIS REQUEST WOULD COMPLETE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NEW STATE FUNDED BEDS AS PART OF LARGER PROJECTS THAT WOULD ADD OVER FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NEW STUDENT BEDS IN TOTAL. SO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF EXPANDING STUDENT HOUSING THE UNIVERSITY HAS LEARNED THAT STUDENTS WANT TO LIVE IN CAMPUS HOUSING THE PROXIMITY TO CLASSES IN CAMPUS SERVICES RELIABLE RENT AND KARATE REQUEST FEARS. MEANS THAT AS SOON AS THE PROJECT IS COMPLETED IT HAS BEEN FULLY OCCUPIED WITH STUDENTS. WE HAVE SEEN THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GUARANTEE STUDENT HOUSING THAT IS FAR BELOW MARKET RATE. CURRENTLY UC CAMPUS HOUSING IS OFFERED UP 220% BELOW MARKET RATE RESTRICTIONS ON RENT BASED INCOME OF NEARBY STUDENT. NON STUDENT POPULATION DOES NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE TO THE STUDENTS HAVING UNIQUE TEMPORARY ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES IF THIS PROGRAM IS EXPANDED BEYOND THE CURRENT TWO BILLION. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ON HOW RENT COULD BE CALCULATED SO AS TO MINIMIZE STUDENT COSTS WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE REALITIES OF THE CONSTRUCTION MARKET. IN TWENTY TWENTY UC CAMPUSES WERE HOUSING ABOUT HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS OR 87% OF THE STUDENT POPULATION. SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES WOULD LIKE THE HOUSE HALF OF THEIR STUDENT POPULATIONS. AS TO UNIVERSITY INCREASES OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT POPULATION BY ANOTHER 1% ANNUALLY AND AS WE INCREASE GRADUATE STUDENT ENROLLMENT WE WILL NEED MORE HOUSING TO ENSURE WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AVAILABLE FOR OUR STUDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND LET ME JUST CUT TO THE CHASE WITH A QUESTION- THE OF. LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR LAST YEAR- DID TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION HOUSING OVER THREE YEARS FOR ALL THREE BRANCHES. N. IT'S MY UNDER IT AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT THE CSU HEARING- LAST WEEK WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE HEARING NEXT WEEK A. N. IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S JUST DRAMATICALLY OVERSUBSCRIBED FROM THE START SO. DID I UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS- AN AGGREGATE OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN APPLICATIONS THAT ARE IN IN THIS FIRST ROUND. THAT IS CORRECT- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA QUALIFIES FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION OF THE TOTAL PROGRAM AND WE HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED SIX HUNDRED MILLION WORTH OF PROJECTS AND DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOUR PRIORITIZING TO GET TO THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WHO ARE EXPECTING THE STATE TO DO THAT AND HOW THE APPLICATIONS COME. WE ARE ANTICIPATING THE STATE THE SELECT WHICH PROGRAMS WHICH PROJECTS THEY WANT TO FIND- AND SHOULD THERE BE MORE FUNDING MADE AVAILABLE HOPEFUL THAT PERHAPS YOU CAN. FIND ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS AND IF THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR AND YOU HAVE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOES THAT PRESUME THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE OTHER PROJECTS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD YEAR. ROUTED AS- AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OPENS UP THE NEXT ROUND OF APPLICATIONS WE WOULD ALLOW ANY ADDITIONAL CAMPUSES TO APPLY FOR THOSE FUNDS IF THEY WISH. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THOUGH IS. YOU'RE ALREADY AT THE ED IT IS A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IS FOR JUST FOR THE FIRST YEAR THE CAP PRODUCT. THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION AS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM ALL YEARS TOWER YOUR SAY SO THEN. YOU HAVE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR ALL THREE YEARS IN THE FIRST YEAR YOU'VE APPLIED FOR SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND YOU JUST INDICATED THAT YOU WOULD ALLOW CAMPUSES TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS FOR EVEN MORE IN THE SECOND OR THIRD YEAR SET CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT WITH THAT IS THAT BASICALLY TO DEMONSTRATE THE NEED EVEN IF IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THERE'S MONEY AVAILABLE. WHERE WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT OUR CAMPUSES FEEL THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE WE DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM THEY CAN'T COMPETE BUT I MEAN ARE YOU IF THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WAS GIVEN TO THE UNIVERSITY. IN GRANTS IN THE FIRST YEAR- AND THEN PEOPLE ARE STILL APPLYING YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW THEY CAN COMPETE BUT THE MONEY WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN SUBSCRIBE FOR THE FULL UC PORTION FOR THE THREE YEARS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT THAT'S CORRECT IT IS IT IS IT THAT JUST SEEMS LIKE A WEIRD PROCESS. IT A. N. I'M NOT I MEAN. IT'S YOUR ABILITY TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT BURKE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S RAISING FALSE HOPES IN LESS WE DO. WHAT I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO APPROPRIATE ADDITIONAL MONEY BECAUSE THEY NEED TO SPEND DEMONSTRATE. THIS IS SO- BUT I A N. DOT. N. I KNOW THAT WITHIN THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION. IT'S DIFFERENT CAMPUSES IT'S WHERE IT SHOVEL READY I KNOW HASTINGS'S IN THEIR FOR THEIR MAJOR PROJECT AND THAT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROJECT FOR THEM. AND SO- D. I. A. IN OUR- YOU'RE LOOKING TENSE I THINK I WOULD JUST MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT ARM. THAT I AGREE FOR ONE COMMITTEE MEMBER AND OTHERS CAN SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES THAT IT ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL BE NICE IF WE DID MORE FOR THIS OVER THE THREE YEARS TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS AND IT'S- IF YOU'VE GOT SOME CAMPUSES SAYING THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT STUDENTS IN LEICESTER'S HOUSING AND THEN. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GRANTS FOR HOUSING AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS CHANGED IN THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING MARKET IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET HOUSING AND SOME. SOME CAMPUSES- IN SUMMER IN THE CSU SYSTEM NOT NOT JUST UC. ARE ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH PEOPLE FINDING A PLACE TO LIVE AFTER ACCEPTANCE AND IT'S JUST GETTING IN THE WAY OF THEIR EDUCATION THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A REAL ISSUE SO. I THINK WITHOUT GOING BACK AND FORTH ANYMORE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- THAT DID TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO MY COLLEAGUES- WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT MORE FOR THIS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO WORK. BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO. OUR WHAT ME ASK- CENTER BURKE CHAU BOAT IF THE BOAT IF SHE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THE SIDE. I JUST WHEN I ECHO YOUR YOUR CONCERNS AND YOUR COMMENTS AT I COMPLETELY AGREE. AT IT GOES BACK TO MY EARLIER COMMENT ON. THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE OF OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE C. IS USED IN OUR SPECIES TO. ADMIT MORE STUDENTS BUT- WERE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO CATER. ONE CLASSES COURSE AVAILABILITY TO HOUSING TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR OUR FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND AND I WAS JUST GONNA CAREERS IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AS A FORMER REALTOR. YOU'D MENTIONED THE STUDENT HOUSING BEING BETWEEN TEN TO UP THAT'S STILL SEEMS VERY HIGH FOR STUDENT HOUSING- ON THAT END SO- I. WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS TODAY THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT FURTHER- ALLOCATION OF A FUNDING- ON THAT ON THAT ASPECT BACK DOWN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE CONVERSATIONS I THINK YOU TO YOUR COMMENTS AND- THANK YOU- TO SAY. FOR A PUTTING UP WITH SEVEN. DIFFERENT ITEMS AND WE HAVE MADE IT THROUGH. HOWEVER WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES UNTIL. FOUR WE HAVE TO GERM AND SO- I'M- GOING TO GO TO TESTIMONY BUT- I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO IT A DIFFERENT WAY WHICH IS. I THINK- ANYBODY THAT COMES ON OR IS IN THE ROOM IS JUST GONNA HAVE TO SAY THEIR NAME IN THE ORGANIZATION. AND WHAT THEY'RE FOR AGAINST IT JUST NO EXPLANATION AND THEN WE'LL TRY TO GET THROUGH AS MANY OF THEM AS WE CAN. BEFORE FIVE TO TWELVE AND BEFORE I GO TO THE MODERATOR AND MODERATOR STAND BY.
