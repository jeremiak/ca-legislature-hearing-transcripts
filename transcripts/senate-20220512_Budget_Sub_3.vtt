ENTIRE YEAR THIS FIND

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:58.163
HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN LESS THAN

FUNDING SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:07.239
FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT AGAIN

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:21.153
A SMALL SUBSET OF THE LARGER

00:20:21.219 --> 00:20:23.488

THE FACILITIES DON'T FEEL LIKE

IT'S GOING TO BE IN AND-

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:48.153
IMPEDIMENT TO BEING ABLE TO OPEN

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.656
UP. NEW FACILITIES IN A TIMELY

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:53.458
MANNER. KELLY I WILL DEFER TO

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:54.726
YOU IN REGARDS TO THE

DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:59.631
HAD. YEAH WE- THEY ARE NOT HAPPY

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:01.499
WITH THE FRANKLY BECAUSE IT IS

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:02.767
CHALLENGING TIMES FOR THEM IN

00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:05.637
TERMS OF- MAINTAINING ADEQUATE

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:06.805
WORKFORCE RESPONDING TO

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:08.707
INCREASED DEMAND EMERGING FROM

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:11.743
THE PANDEMIC. AND THEY WE HAVE

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:12.844
BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH THEM

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:14.112
ABOUT THE NEESSITY OF IT AND

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.181
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE

00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:17.549
GIVEN HOW ARE FEES ARE

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:19.751
STRUCTURED IN THE REQUIRED TO

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:22.988
BE. SELF SUPPORTING. OKAY I MEAN

00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:26.791
TO DEMEAN. THAT THAT'S

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.994
PROBLEMATIC IS AS WE'RE TRYING

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.196
TO OPEN OPEN UP MORE FACILITIES

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:33.298
IF THE IF THE LICENSURE AND

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.433
CERTIFICATION FEES ARE GOING TO

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.602
BE. AN IMPEDIMENT SO WE'LL HAVE

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:42.741
TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT-

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:47.345
MIKE PENCE. BUT SO YOU MENTIONED

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:49.314
A PART OF THE REASON FOR THE-

00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:50.649
FOR THE FARM FUND IS ACTUALLY

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:52.717
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO GIVE A FEE

00:25:52.784 --> 00:25:56.288
WAIVERS AND OTHER- ACTIONS-

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:58.556
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC DID I

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:00.759
HEAR THAT CORRECTLY. YES IS

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:03.328
MULTI FACTORIAL THEY HAD ME

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:04.296
WE'VE HAD SOME SOME FACILITIES

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:06.731
CLOSE AS THE SEVENTIES DURING

00:26:06.798 --> 00:26:08.533
THE PANDEMIC STATES FINANCIAL

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.635
HARDSHIP AND GET A FEW WAIVERS

00:26:10.702 --> 00:26:14.572
BUT HONEST THE BIGGEST. ISSUE IS

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:16.741
LEGISLATIVE BILL THAT IS ASKING

00:26:16.808 --> 00:26:18.543
US TO STEP UP OVERSIGHT

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.445
MONITORING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:21.546
THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH STAFF

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:25.150
COST AND SO- WEEK AND NOT REYES

00:26:25.216 --> 00:26:26.718
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MECHANISM TO

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:28.253
RAISE FEES BASED ON ACTUAL

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.356
LITERALLY WE JUST GOT IN. SO THE

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.224
QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT OF SO

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:34.659
SOUNDS LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:36.695
THREE FACTORS RIGHT SO ONE IS

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:38.563
CLOSURES SO OBVIOUSLY CLOSED SO

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.132
HE DOESN'T PAY ANY FEES. TO IS

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:42.734
YOU HAVE FACILITIES UNDER STRESS

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:43.868
AND SO THEY'RE ASKING FOR FREE

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:45.103
WAIVER SO IT CAN CONTINUE

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.206
OPERATING WHICH YOU KNOW IT'S

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:48.807
NOT NAZARIAN APPROPRIATE THE

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:49.908
THIRD YOU SAID OF COURSE IS

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:51.810
INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO

00:26:51.876 --> 00:26:53.611
INCREASE REQUIREMENTS THAT MIGHT

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:58.350
IMPACT THE LEGISLATURE. OTHER

00:26:58.416 --> 00:26:59.884
REASONS. CAN YOU. SO IN TERMS OF

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:01.619
THE- AND THE FEE WAY. CAN YOU

00:27:01.686 --> 00:27:03.989
TELL ME WHAT PERCENTAGE OF I

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:06.925
GUESS. THE S. LICENSEES WILL

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:09.494
FALL UNDER THAT CATEGORY- IN THE

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:11.329
LESS SO THAT THEY TWO YEARS AGO

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:12.764
WE HAD HOW MANY LICENSEES AND

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:14.399
THEN WE'VE LOST HOW MANY

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:15.300
FORECLOSURES AND HOW MANY HAVE.

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:17.369
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE ARE

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:17.969
CLOSE AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF

00:27:18.036 --> 00:27:19.304
THOSE HAVE GOTTEN FEW WAIVERS.

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:21.006
EVERY AT LEAST GIVE ME A ROUGH

00:27:21.072 --> 00:27:22.207
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IS ARE WE

00:27:22.273 --> 00:27:27.212
TALKING LIKE 10% 20% 30% 50% IT

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:29.114
IS A SMALL NUMBER OF CLOSURES

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.815
RELATIVELY. AFFECTS YOUR VERY

00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:32.650
SPECIFIC OKAY. SO SMALL NUMBERS

00:27:32.717 --> 00:27:35.220
TO SMALL AT THE END OF FIVE

00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:36.488
PERCENTAGE UNDER TEN PERCENTAGE

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:38.223
. YES LED TO GET BACK TO YOUR

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:40.225
EXACT OKAY AND THEN IN A FEW

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:43.328
WAIVERS REPRESENT ROUGHLY WHAT

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:45.363
PERCENTAGE IS THAT. AGAIN I NEED

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.532
TO GET BACK TO THE- AND THE

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:48.800
LEGISLATIVE PROCLAMATION I DON'T

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:50.168
PROMISE YOU I WON'T HOLD YOU

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.437
DIRECTLY TO THE EXACT NUMBER-

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.672
BUT ARE WE ARE WE LOOKING AT

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:57.208
THIRD ARE WE LOOKING AT. 10% ARE

00:27:57.275 --> 00:28:00.378
WE LOOKING AT HALF. YEAH I WHAT

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:01.646
I IN MY UNDERSTANDING FROM

CARE AND TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.110
WILL RESTART THE QUESTION FOR

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:28.678
YOU. THE CASF CHANCE OF

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:29.912
MODERNIZATION APPROACH FROM

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:31.514
FOCUSING ON INDIVIDUAL

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.916
TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ARE PROJECTS.

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.751
FOCUSING ON THE ENTIRE MEDICAID

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:39.322
ENTERPRISE. AND OVER PLAN TO

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:41.090
INCREMENTALLY MODERNIZE OUR

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.758
SYSTEM THE SYSTEM NECESSARY TO

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.094
ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. THIS IS

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.230
A SIGNIFICANT CONTACT AFRICAN WE

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:49.065
CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:51.067
SUBJECT THE ROBUST LEGISLATIVE

QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FINANCE.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:11.287
INTERCAPITAL BERMAN ON FURTHER.

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.589
OKAY AND I THINK ELIO HAS

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:14.724
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE ONE

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:15.758
ALL RIGHT L. L. GOOD MORNING

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.960
METZGER L. A. I WE HAVE NOTICED

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:18.895
. CAN WITH PROPOSAL BUT RECKONED

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.062
APPROVE WITH PROVISIONAL BUDGET

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:21.330
BILLING. THERE WERE THAT A TO

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:22.865
SAY IT'S A MY- STRATEGY FOR THIS

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:25.301
EFFORT VILLAGE- THE MES. EFFORT

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:26.936
WILL UPDATE AND REPLACE MANY OF

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:29.138
THE I. T. SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:30.907
THE STATE'S MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:31.807
THE INITIAL STRATEGY WILL

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:33.676
OUTLINE THE GOALS OUTCOMES

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:35.711
TARGETS FOR THIS EFFORT DECIDE

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.446
THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:38.814
FOR THE EFFORT AS WELL AS START

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.483
TO EXPLAIN HOW ALL OF THE

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.651
PROJECTS WITHIN THIS EFFORT WILL

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.386
BE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED.

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:44.387
CONSISTENT MEETING THIS

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:46.489
DOCUMENTATION TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:47.723
WILL HELP TO DETERMINE WHETHER

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.225
THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:50.793
EFFORT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.762
MITIGATED. AND HOW LONG IT WILL

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.130
TAKE TO COMPLETE THIS EFFORT AS

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:56.465
WELL AS AT WHAT COST- IT'S OUR

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:56.966
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.367
ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS THIS

01:03:58.434 --> 01:03:59.869
LANGUAGE TO BE POTENTIALLY

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:01.003
DUPLICATIVE OF THE CURRENT

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:02.438
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.640
REQUIRES QUARTERLY MEETINGS- BUT

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.209
WE THINK MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:07.710
TO SPECIFY THAT THE STRATEGY

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.445
DOCUMENTATION BE DELIVERED. BY

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:10.880
THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR WILL

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:11.714
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.684
ACCOUNTABILITY AND CLARIFY- THIS

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.952
EFFORT AS IT MOVES FORWARD THANK

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:18.187
YOU. HI THANK YOU AND CERTAINLY

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:20.723
APPRECIATE THAT RECOMMENDATION

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.525
AND AN AGREEMENT WITH THAT- CAN.

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:26.996
SO CAN YOU- F. DTS SECOND. HE

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:29.732
SPEAK TO. A POLICY WE HADN'T

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.500
NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF OUTDATED

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:35.304
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE FAILED US-

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:39.208
DURING CRITICAL MOMENTS- AND-

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.876
FINDING OUT THAT WE HAVE LEGACY

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.945
SYSTEMS THERE EVEN WRITTEN AND-

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:44.647
YOU KNOW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:47.283
THAT- NO ONE LEARNS ANYMORE

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.118
WE'RE TRYING TO POINT RETIREES.

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:51.887
WHO WHO KNOW KOBOL ANOTHER TYPED

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:56.926
LANGUAGES WHICH I THINK IF I

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:57.893
SHARED THEM WITH THE- PEOPLE WHO

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.762
ARE MUCH YOUNGER AND I THINK

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.731
WHAT'S THAT- SO CAN MAYBE SPEAK.

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:03.099
WHAT'S THAT STATE OF THE OF SOME

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:05.268
OF THESE MEDICAL SYSTEMS ARE WE

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:06.369
ARE WE IN THAT SITUATION WITH

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:08.971
MEDIC CAL- AND FOR SOME OF OUR

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.339
SYSTEMS LEGACY SYSTEMS AND THEN

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:11.707
ALSO IN TERMS OF THE

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:16.245
MODERNIZATION APPROACH- YOU KNOW

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:19.315
HOW. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:21.684
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE WORKING WITH-

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.586
FOR EXAMPLE WELL I MEAN I THINK

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.755
IN THE- CITY ITSELF IS A VERY

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:26.489
LARGE DEPARTMENT BUT WORKING

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:29.058
WITH THAT. THE THE PART OF

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.694
TECHNOLOGY AND WITH THE- WITH

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:34.363
THE- I GUESS SYSTEMS INTEGRATION

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:37.600
AND- THE PART HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:40.770
SERVICES ON THESE PROJECTS. YEAH

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:42.538
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I'M

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.206
NOT GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.474
CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER CHRIS

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.043
RETURN TO GIVE YOU MORE

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:51.147
DETAILED. FONG THANK YOU. HEY

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:52.548
CHRIS RESEND DEPARTMENT HEALTH

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.017
CARE SERVICES AND THANK YOU FOR

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.286
THE QUESTION CENTER AND- SO

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:58.821
FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE STATE

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:02.792
OF THE SYSTEMS- ABSOLUTELY- D.

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:06.128
ACS HAS. HUNDREDS OF BUSINESS

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:09.031
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE PART OF

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:10.800
HOW WE DO BUSINESS EVERY DAY AND

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:14.103
SOME OF THOSE SYSTEMS GO BACK

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.038
FORTY PLUS YEARS IN TERMS OF

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.807
HAVING BEEN BUILT. AND THEY'RE

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:19.141
STILL WRITTEN IN THE SAME

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.676
LANGUAGES THAT THEY WERE

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:22.445
ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN SOME OF

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:25.081
ITS COBALT- IN FACT WE JUST HAD

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:26.682
THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.818
MEDS SYSTEM ONE OF OUR CRITICAL

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:32.021
STATE SYSTEM SO- YES WE'RE IN

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:34.790
THAT BOAT- NOW JUST BECAUSE IT

01:06:34.857 --> 01:06:38.060
IS A SYSTEM. THAT IS WRITTEN IN

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.262
AN OLDER LANGUAGE DOESN'T MEAN.

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:42.498
THAT IT IS NECESSARILY OF

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.934
SIGNIFICANT RISK- I'LL JUST USE

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.369
MEDS AS AN EXAMPLE IT HAS

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:49.538
CONTINUED TO OPERATE- OUR STATE

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.741
STAFF TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEM DO A

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:53.809
GREAT JOB- BUT YOU'RE RIGHT

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.611
THERE IS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.280
THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO HIRE

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.383
INDIVIDUALS. AND HAVE THE

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:02.952
RESOURCES NECESSARY TO RUN THOSE

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:05.988
OLDER SYSTEMS. I WILL SAY I'VE

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:09.125
HEARD OF- RECENTLY- AND WELL

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:11.060
MAYBE IN RECENT YEARS ABOUT

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.629
KOBOL. BEING TALKED ONCE AGAIN

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.598
IN COLLEGES. HOWEVER I DON'T

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:16.832
THINK THAT WE SHOULD BASE OUR

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:19.201
FUTURE ON ON THAT LAST THAT

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:21.036
SITUATION I THINK IT'S MORE

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:22.471
BECAUSE IT CAN BE LUCRATIVE

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.873
BECAUSE QUITE A FEW

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:27.777
ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY HAVE-

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:30.546
OLDER SYSTEM- IS THAT GOOD FOR

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:31.814
YOUR FIRST QUESTION YEAH YOU

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:34.383
KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S HELPFUL-

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.452
SO I GUESS- JUST LOG OUT SWITCH

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:38.654
FROM COBALT TO FORTRAN AND NOW

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.222
EVERYONE'S GOING LIKE WHAT ARE

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:41.857
YOU TALKING ABOUT I THINK WE'RE

01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:44.427
REALLY DATING OURSELVES- YES. IN

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:46.262
AN HOUR APPROACH FOR THE NEW

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:49.198
SYSTEMS IS ABSOLUTELY MODERN-

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:51.867
BOTH IN TERMS OF- OUR APPROACH

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:53.102
TO BUILDING THOSE SYSTEMS BUT

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:56.005
ALSO THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.873
LANGUAGES THAT WE USED TO BUILD

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.242
THEM- THE SECOND QUESTION IN

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:02.445
TERMS OF THE CURRENT- WORK

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.046
HAPPENING TO BUILD OUT THE

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:06.081
APPROACH IN THE STRATEGY FOR HOW

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:08.484
WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD ON

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.018
MODERNIZING ALL OF THESE

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:13.389
SYSTEMS- YES WE WORK- CLOSELY.

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:15.391
PARTICULARLY WITH- DEPARTMENT OF

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:17.460
TECHNOLOGY IN FACT WE HAVE

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:18.994
REGULAR WORK AT IT THAT'S

01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:22.064
OCCURRING- FOR US THIS WORK TO

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:23.966
PLAN OUT THAT STRATEGY IS NOT AT

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:26.302
A PROJECT LEVEL- IT'S AT A

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:27.870
HIGHER LEVEL. AND WE HAVE

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.772
REGULAR INTERACTIONS AND

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.941
INVOLVEMENTS WITH DEPARTMENT OF

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:35.911
TECHNOLOGY- THEY ARE INCLUDED IN

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:39.815
THE REGULAR UPDATES THAT WE DO-

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:41.684
SOMETIMES ON A WEEKLY BASIS

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.787
SOMETIMES- EVERY OTHER WEEK. AND

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.455
WE REGULARLY INVITE THEM TO

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:49.291
PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND- COMMENTS

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:51.293
ON WHERE WE'RE AT WHAT WE'RE

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.764
WORKING ON AT THE TIME- BUT

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:57.466
OVERALL THE APPROACH AND

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.501
STRATEGY. IN ADDITION- WE HAVE

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:02.338
PROVIDED THEM- IN ESSENCE- WORK

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:05.274
PRODUCTS OR DELIVERABLES OUT OF-

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:08.244
THIS EFFORT AND- SO THAT THEY

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.846
HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:12.648
BROAD MORE BROADLY WITHIN THE

01:09:12.715 --> 01:09:15.718
ORGANIZATION AND HOW- FEEDBACK

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:18.153
PROVIDED TO US THAT WE CAN TAKE

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.154
INTO ACCOUNT AS WE CONTINUE TO

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.457
REFINE. THE OVERALL APPROACH IN

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:24.960
THIS IS THIS WILL BE NOT JUST AS

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:26.328
WE WORK ON THE APPROACH AND

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.130
STRATEGY BUT IT'S AN ONGOING

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:30.065
RELATIONSHIP AND PARTNERSHIP.

01:09:30.132 --> 01:09:31.800
THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM SO IT

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.602
WILL CONTINUE AS WE GO FORWARD

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:37.273
ON THIS- VERY BROAD AND- EVERY

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:40.276
COMPLEX AND LARGE EFFORTS. IN

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:43.812
ADDITION FROM A COW HHS AGENCIES

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.748
STANDPOINT- WE HAVE SOME VERY

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:48.083
SIMILAR RELATIONSHIP IMPACT- SO

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:50.185
THE OFFICE OF THE AGENCY

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:53.289
INFORMATION OFFICER IS INVOLVED

01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:54.890
IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING-

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:57.059
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT- MAYBE MORE

01:09:57.126 --> 01:10:00.129
HANDS ON IN CLOSER TO THE WORK-

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:04.233
AND- WORKING WITH US TO DEVELOP.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.936
WHAT WE HAVE- BUT THEY ALSO

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:08.804
PROVIDE REGULAR FEEDBACK

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.206
COMMENTS AND HELP US TO CONTINUE

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:13.576
TO SHAPE WHERE WE'RE GOING- IT'S

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:15.044
NOT THE OFFICE OF SYSTEM

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.379
INTEGRATION THE WE WORK. CLOSELY

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:19.381
WITH THEM ON VARIOUS EFFORTS

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:21.150
THAT IT THAT ARE TIED TO ALL OF

01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:26.255
THIS- AND MEETING THE OVERALL.

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:29.191
MATT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL GUESS I

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.793
GUESS THIS YOU OBSERVE IN AGAIN

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.127
BRIGITTE L. A. AS

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:33.963
RECOMMENDATIONS- BUT

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:36.665
UNFORTUNATELY- IT PROJECTS- WHEN

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:38.300
THEY GO WELL WE DON'T HEAR MUCH

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:40.769
ABOUT HIM- WHEN THEY GO BADLY-

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:42.671
THEY MAKE THE FRONT PAGE OF THE

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:46.075
NEWS- THEY'RE USUALLY FAIRLY

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:48.210
EXPENSIVE SO THERE'S A

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.778
CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT IN STATE

01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:51.647
RESOURCES SO I RECOGNIZE THAT

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:53.248
THIS IS JUST PROBABLY JUST SOME

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:55.017
AND YOU KNOW THE TWENTY MILLION

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.919
WERE NOT TALK WE'RE TALKING

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:59.955
ABOUT. PLANNING AND SO FORTH AND

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:02.358
FIGURING THINGS OUT NOT

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:04.226
ACTUALLY- BUT I THINK THE OTHER

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:06.895
THING IS THAT- WHEN IT COMES TO

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:09.164
I. T. AND YOU KNOW YOU TO TALK

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.065
ABOUT LEGACY SYSTEMS AND SO

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:11.934
FORTH AND- AND I THINK THAT YOU

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.003
KNOW THE ISSUE ISN'T SO MUCH A

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:15.270
LEGACY SYSTEM CAN'T WORK- IS

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:17.172
THAT- IS THAT AS YOU POINT OUT

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:20.709
AND- THANK OVER TIME- IT MAY

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:23.145
BECOME MORE MORE CHALLENGING. TO

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:25.214
FOR IN TERMS OF HOW IT LINKS TO

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.348
OTHER SYSTEMS HAVING FINING THE

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:28.584
PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN IT TOO IF

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:30.486
IN CASE SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN.

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:31.820
TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS AND SO

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:33.756
FORTH AND SO THE EVENTUALLY

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:36.625
GONNA NEED A TRANSITION PLAN- TO

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:38.761
MORE MMHM THE L. BUT DATED

01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:40.896
SYSTEM THAT IS GOING TO BE THAT

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:43.899
THERE'S GONNA BE MORE MANAGEABLE

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.300
SO WHAT. ENOUGH URGENT THE

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:48.337
<u>&lt;c.magenta&gt;OMENT IF YOU KNOW THE LONGER WE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:51.340
WAIT THE GREATER CHALLENGE BE

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:55.611
THAT- I THINK IF THE APPROACH IN

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:56.779
THE FUTURE IS NOT SO MUCH WHY

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:59.248
CALL LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:00.816
WE NEED ONE SYSTEM OR ONE VERY

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.051
LARGE SYSTEM TO THEN TAKE CARE

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.986
OF ALL OF THAT ACCOUNT ALL

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:04.787
RIGHT. IT'S ACTUALLY HOW DO WE

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.455
BUILD MODULAR SYSTEMS RIGHT SO

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:09.124
THAT THERE'S- SO NOT FOR EXAMPLE

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.993
TRAPPED WITH THE- THE WITH ONLY

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.895
HAVING. TWO OR THREE VENDORS WHO

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.396
CAN HANDLE HUGE SYSTEM RIGHT

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:15.998
IT'S AT THE HEART OF THE

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:17.132
BUILDINGS IN THE MODULAR WAY

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:18.834
THAT CAN. AND FRANKLY OF ALL

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:20.069
RIGHT SO IT'S NOT ABOUT BUILDING

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:23.238
A SYSTEM FOR- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:24.773
FIVE YEARS OR WHATEVER THAT WILL

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.874
TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING AND THEN

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:27.743
WE NEED TO REDO IT AGAIN AND

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:29.712
THIRTY YEARS AFTER THAT IT'S

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:30.979
MORE LIKE IT HOW HOW DO WE BUILD

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:32.014
SYSTEMS THAT CAN INVOLVE. THIS

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:35.451
TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES RATE SO- AND

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.119
OUTLINING THAT APPROACH I THINK

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.887
IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT SO

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.723
HOW DO WE TAKE WHAT WE HAVE NOW

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:42.691
HOW DO WE EVOLVE THAT INTO THE

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:43.992
FUTURE. HOW DO WE BILL HOW YOU

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:46.495
BUILD OUT A- AND I. T-

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:48.497
ESSENTIALLY ECOSYSTEM. THAT CAN

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:50.432
SERVE THE NEEDS A MEDIC CAL EVEN

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.101
AS YOU KNOW WE'RE MAKING

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.135
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MEDIKAL

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:57.773
ITSELF. AND THAT- AND THAT I. T.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.508
UP NO WE FOR EXAMPLE. WE'VE

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:01.744
HEARD THAT ONE REASONS THAT BEEN

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:03.912
GIVEN FOR FREE FOR WHY WE HAVE

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:10.152
TO DELAY AND TRYING TO ROLL.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.254
UNDOCUMENTED DAHLE SEWER NOT SEE

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:15.124
. AND I USED. IS THE I. T. SAYS

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:16.892
. MAY NOT BE ABLE TO UP SOME GOT

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:18.694
THREE. VILLAGE WELL WE NEED TO

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:20.429
HAVE SYSTEMS THAT CAN MOVE AT

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:21.230
THE SPEED OF WHICH WE'RE TRYING

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:23.365
TO MAKE POLICY- AND THEN OF

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:23.999
COURSE YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T WITH

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:26.034
CMS AND SO THERE'S- NO POLICY

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:27.536
THAT CHANGES RIGHT AND- WHETHER.

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:29.605
IT'S GOOD THINGS- LIKE CAL AIM

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:30.873
AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:31.707
SOMETIMES THERE'S OTHER

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:32.641
REQUIREMENTS AND WE JUST

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.610
ACTUALLY HAD A VCP ABOUT YOU

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.011
KNOW INCREASING REQUIREMENTS

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:39.348
FOR. TERRA SO- FOR- FOR

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:41.049
EVALUATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:43.986
RIGHT SO- SO WHAT. WOULD BE

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:45.854
HELPFUL IS TO BE ABLE TO SEE AND

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:48.457
AGAIN GOING BACK TO WHAT THEY

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:49.258
LOW RECOMMENDATION IS THAT. SO

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:51.827
WHAT IS THAT. SIR THAT PATH TO

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.262
BUILDING THAT KIND OF AN IT

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.230
SYSTEM FOR MEDICARE WHICH OF

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:56.932
COURSE ALSO S. INTEGRATE. AND

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.033
CONNECT WITH ALL THE OTHER

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.369
SOCIAL SERVICE AND- OTHER HEALTH

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:02.371
CARE RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:04.072
A- A YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:07.743
ABOUT A- YOU KNOW BETWEEN A-

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.378
PEAK. PAYER DATABASE TO ON THE

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:13.849
HEALTH SIDE TO HAVING A- YEAH-

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:14.983
THAT THE HEALTH INFORMATION

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.218
EXCHANGE AND THEN ON THE SOCIAL

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:17.820
SERVICE SIDE OF COURSE WITH

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:18.821
MEDICARE HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.088
THAT CONNECT FOR ALL THE

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:21.023
ELIGIBILITY STUFF THAT HAPPENS

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:22.858
NOT ONLY FOR MEDICARE- BUT FOR

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:24.159
OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES AND SO

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.727
FORTH. SO CERTAINLY MEDICAL

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:28.297
SYSTEMS. THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:29.464
COVERED CALIFORNIA AS WELL. SO

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:30.933
YOU SET THE SET A LITTLE BIT OF

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:32.334
A NEXUS OF. HAVING INTERFACE

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.002
WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.504
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP IMPROVE

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.005
THE QUALITY OF SERVICE NOT ONLY

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:40.042
FOR MEDIC CAL ITSELF- BUT ALSO

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:41.777
FOR OTHER SERVICES THAT EIGHT

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.812
THAT THE DEDICATION REYES MAY

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:46.315
RECEIVE. AS WELL SO-IT SO I

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:48.350
DON'T KNOW THAT SOUNDS OVERLY

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.219
AMBITIOUS BUT- I THINK THAT'S-

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:51.854
WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME FEEDBACK

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:54.223
AS TO HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:57.726
AND WHAT THE PLANS MIGHT BE.

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:58.827
TEMPTED TO ACHIEVE THOSE THINGS.

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.996
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY. THAT LOOTING

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.865
AND WHAT ELSE IS IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.666
YOU'RE SECRETLY ATTENDING OUR

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:07.870
MEETING SENATOR. HE WHAT YOU

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.471
EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST RAN

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:10.939
THROUGH IS ACTUALLY RIGHT IN

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:13.375
LINE WITH OUR WE ARE DEVELOPING

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:17.045
SYSTEMS NEW SYSTEMS AT DH CS- WE

01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:19.815
ARE THERE IS A REQUIREMENT- IN

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:22.451
ESSENCE FROM CMS. THAT WE BUILD

01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:24.820
MODULAR BUT THAT'S IT THE NATURE

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.755
AND THE CORE OF OUR WE ARE

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:28.523
BUILDING SYSTEM THESE DAYS THESE

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.192
DAYS FOR GOOD REASON ALL

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.960
EVERYTHING THAT YOU MENTIONED

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:34.229
NOT JUST BECAUSE CMS THINGS

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.430
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:37.499
AND SO. YEAH EVERYTHING THAT YOU

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:39.534
MENTIONED IS THE APPROACH THAT

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:41.303
WE'RE USING WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.038
THIS APPROACH THROUGH THE

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:44.373
FEDERAL DRAWING REPORTING

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:48.443
PROJECT- THAT'S COMING TO A

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:50.379
CLOSE THIS JUNE. WE TAKE NOT

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:52.781
ONLY IN APPROACH TO DELIVERING-

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:55.050
THE SYSTEMS AND MODULES OR

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:57.953
COMPONENTS OR SERVICES-

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:00.088
WHICHEVER WORDS WE WANT TO USE

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:03.058
BUT WE ALSO TAKE AN APPROACH TO

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.494
DELIVER EARLY AND OFTEN. WE WANT

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.195
TO GET THE SYSTEMS AND THE

01:16:07.262 --> 01:16:10.332
FUNCTIONALITY AND OUR PROGRAMS

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:13.035
HANDS AVAILABLE FOR YOU SO THAT

01:16:13.101 --> 01:16:15.470
WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF

01:16:15.537 --> 01:16:16.471
BUILDING THOSE SYSTEMS THAT'S

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:19.141
THE AGILE APPROACH THAT THAT

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:20.976
LAURIE MENTIONED WHEN SHE WAS

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:25.013
SPEAKING- AND- AND WE DO THAT SO

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.215
THAT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB AND

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:30.085
EVOLVE IT TO YOUR POINT- WITHOUT

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:32.721
A DOUBT. WE TAKE EVERY APPROACH

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:34.222
THAT WE CAN AND WE'RE BUILDING

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:37.392
THE SYSTEMS TO MAKE THEM ABLE TO

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:39.661
BE MORE FLEXIBLE FOR THE FUTURE-

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:42.764
SO WERE WERE RIGHT IN LINE WITH.

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:44.967
WHAT YOU SAID THAT IS PART OF

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:46.201
OUR CURRENT APPROACH AND WILL

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.769
CONTINUE TO BE PART OF OUR

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:49.504
APPROACH GOING FORWARD. OKAY

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:53.075
EVERY SHEET THAT- I WAS HAVE NOT

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:53.675
BEEN SECRETLY ATTENDING YOUR

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:58.080
MEETINGS- I GUESS. TWELVE TWELVE

01:16:58.146 --> 01:16:59.514
YEAH. A CERTAIN SUBCOMMITTEE FOR

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:00.849
WELL AT LEAST ME SOME INSIGHT-

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:03.785
YES- BUT IT IT AGAIN IT I THINK

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:04.987
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO HAVE

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.221
SOME REPORTING BACK LANGUAGE- AS

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:08.156
THE L. A. O. SUGGESTED SO THAT.

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:11.493
YOU CAN AT PRESENT- TO US AT

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.627
LEAST WHAT THE LATEST THINKING

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:14.663
IS AND WHAT. IT AND ALSO WHAT.

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.298
IS WORK ON IT AND I'M SURE

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.200
THERE'S GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:19.835
ASKS AND LARGER ASKS FOR IT

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:22.337
MODERNIZATION. THAT THAT WILL

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:24.606
HELP- I GUESS- CONTINUE TO BUILD

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:25.907
CONFIDENCE IN THE WORK THAT

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:27.743
YOU'RE DOING AND THAT- AS WE

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.678
MAKE- CENTURIES VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:31.446

COUPLE OBSERVATIONS THE FIRST OF

COURSE- NICKNAMES I THINK DHS'S

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:57.879
A DATA RICH AGENCY THERE'S A LOT

01:21:57.946 --> 01:21:59.848
OF DATA COLLECTED BY DATA ISN'T

01:21:59.914 --> 01:22:01.049
VERY HELPFUL MUCH YOU COULD TURN

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:02.751

DATA THAT SOMEONE ISN'T DOING

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:09.057
ANALYTICS ISN'T ABLE TO PROCESS

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:10.458
IT IT DOESN'T BECOME VERY

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:12.127
HELPFUL FOR DECISION MAKING SO

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.928
THAT'S- SO CERTAINLY AGREE THAT

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:16.197
WE NEED TO HAVE THE KIND OF

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:17.732
FUNCTIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS

01:22:17.799 --> 01:22:21.236
PROPOSAL. THE I THINK YOU KNOW

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:22.637
SOME OF THE AREAS THAT. CAN BE

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:23.805
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IS FOR

LIKE- YOU KNOW RISK POOLS OF AND

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:28.043
HAVE IS WE'RE DOING TO

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.477
PROCUREMENT SO WHAT IT WHAT

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:34.249
EXACTLY IS THE ACTUAL. DENNIS

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:36.217
LYING- YOU KNOW- THE RISK. AND

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:39.688
VARIABILITY THAT OF- IN TERMS

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:43.458
OF- NEED- THAT- ARE VARIOUS

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:44.759
PLANS AND SO FORTH THEY'RE

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:45.727

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:46.995
THEY'RE FACING AND SO FORTH

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:48.229
ENSURED THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE

THE CARE THEY NEED- SO WELL

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:52.867

CAN MAKE BETTER CONTRACTS- AND

01:22:57.872 --> 01:22:59.374
ALSO. I THINK RISK ADJUSTMENTS

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:00.875
CAN BE CRITICAL TO BE SURE WE

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:04.879

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.314
KNOW THE MOST APPROPRIATELY AS

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:07.849

OUT THAT SOMEONE'S DIABETES.

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:25.166
LIVES IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD MAY

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:26.668
NEED FEWER RESOURCES ON DIABETES

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.169
ANOTHER ONE JUST BECAUSE OF THE

01:23:28.236 --> 01:23:29.003
NATURE OF THE COMMUNITY
