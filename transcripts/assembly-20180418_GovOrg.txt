FIGHT FIRE ACROSS THE STATE DOES SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES WERE DEMONSTRATED IN OUR RECENT WILDFIRES THAT THAT OCCURRED IN SANTA ROSA AND AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S WHILE. THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES THAT OCCUR DURING THESE TIMES. FROM THE ABILITY TO GET THE PROPER RESOURCES ON THE ROAD IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE NOTIFICATION OF CITIZENS THERE WERE IN THE PATH OF THESE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. AND ALSO INCLUDING. THE ABILITY TO LOCATE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN TRAPPED AND AND. NEEDING THE ASSISTANCE OF OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL. SIMILARLY OF FIREFIGHTERS ACROSS THE STATE FIGHT STRUCTURE FIRES ON A DAILY BASIS WHEN THEY DO SO THEY DO SO WHAT TECHNOLOGY THAT IS. QUITE OLD AND THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THINGS SIMILARLY IN THE FIRE SERVICE FOR MANY MANY YEARS. IN THIS EMERGING SMART TAG TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS ASSEMBLY BILL AS. BEING EXPLOITED TO PROVIDE THINGS LIKE REAL REAL TIME TRAFFIC DATA A BUILDING IN ROOM LAYOUTS FIRST RESPONDER VICTIM LOCATIONS. OF PHYSICAL PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORS AT SUCH A. SMART EQUIPMENT WILL SELL FIREFIGHTERS THE SPACE THEY'RE ENTERING THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THEY WILL ENCOUNTER AND THE LOCATION AND STATUS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE POTENTIALLY TRAPPED IN THE BUILDING.

I MISTER COOPER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR BRING THIS BILL FORD IT'S IT'S MUCH. NEEDED OBVIOUSLY TECHNOLOGY MERGES EVERYDAY AND EVOLVES AND THIS IS MY HOMETOWN FIRE DEPARTMENT AND. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO IT'S. NO BIAS. WHATSOEVER BUT NOT ANY AGENCY AND. THEY DO A GREAT A DEAL FOR OUR COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. GIPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO WANT TO LIVE IN MY COMMENTS WITH THE. PREVIOUS SPEAKER I THINK IT'S A. GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I LOOK FORWARD TO NOW ONLY VOTING THIS BILL BUT ALSO ASKING IF YOU WOULD PLEASE CONSIDER PUTTING ME ON AS CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL WAS I THINK IT MAKES SENSE AND I THINK IF THE. PILOT PROGRAM DOES WELL WHICH I BELIEVE IT WILL THAT IT'S ARE YOU CAN BE A MODEL FOR OTHER AREAS IN CALIFORNIA WE WANT WE MUST GET AHEAD OF. OF THIS AND USE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO US WITH ADVANCEMENT UP TRYING TO SAVE LIVES AND I THINK THIS TO STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEED TO. AND YOU TO WALK ANYTHING FOR BLOCK. THIS FOR ALL OUR. ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE BY THINGS COULD BILL AND. SERVICE SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT A CHORUS OF FOLKS WHO ARE WATER CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL. ABOUT MANY YEARS AGO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE DATA FIRE TRAINING. TOUR AT TEN ACADEMY DOWN NO GROSSMAN. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE ALWAYS REMEMBERED FROM THAT TOUR. WAS GOING INTO A BUILDING THAT WERE THE POWERS BEEN CUT. OUT FILLED WITH SMOKE AND IT OCCURRING TO ME THAT YOU CAN'T SEE. YOU ALWAYS THINK OF A FIRE OR SOMETHING AND WALK INTO ITS BRIGHT YOU CAN SEE YOUR WAY AROUND AND THEN I GOT TO DO THAT SAME ACTIVITY WITH SOME EQUIPMENT THAT ALLOWED ME TO SEE CLEARLY. INSIDE THE FIRE AND. SO IT'S IT'S NOT A IT CERTAINLY LEFT ME WITH THE IMPRESSION IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT. TO THOSE THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. TO MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE TO USE THAT PRECEDE YOU BRING IN THE BILL I'D SAY RIGHT TO BE HAD AS WELL SO PERHAPS YOU CAN OPEN UP FOR SERIES OF COAUTHORS COMING OUT OF HERE. GEO. MISTER BIGELOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO OUR COMMENT AS WELL. WE HAVE ANOTHER CO AUTHOR PERFECT. OKAY HAVING ANIMUS CO AUTHORS BY THE MEMBERS PRESENT. AND. WITH THAT AND WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND. OKAY WE HAVE. I'LL HOLD ON WE HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED A QUORUM WE GOT WE GOT AHEAD OF OURSELVES. HIS ARMS IF YOU DARE DO A REMINDER CALL TO SOME OF THE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE STARTS AT ONE THIRTY. AND. WILL GET SOME OF THEM UP HERE MISTER FLOOR SAYS WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL TAKE THE BILL UP. ABOUT THANK YOU FOR BRING IT FORWARD TODAY I APPRECIATE AND EXPECT RESPECTFULLY AUSTRIA I DON'T THINK SO MUCH. OKAY MEMBERS AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO MISTER QUIRK. THIS IS ITEM. THIRTEEN ON YOUR AGENDA AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY EIGHT MISTER QUIRK PLEASE APPROACH AND. BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION NOW WHEN YOU'RE READY. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE FOR THE ANALYSIS. JUDY ILLNESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN WILL READ MY SPEAKING POINTS. WELCOME MISTER BERMAN. THANK YOU CHAIR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK WOULD LIKE TO THINK COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH HIS OFFICE IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY EIGHT WOULD ALLOW ADVISORY COMMITTEES TO MEET VIA TELECONFERENCE PROVIDED THEY MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. THESE INCLUDE ADOPTING GUIDELINES POSTING ONE PHYSICAL LOCATION WHERE A QUORUM WILL BE THE PUBLIC CAN PARTICIPATE. ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE MOSTLY OPERATED BY UNPAID VOLUNTEERS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. THEY PROVIDE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ON A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS THEIR UNPAID AND HAVE NO DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY. THAT PROVIDE THE STATE A GREAT SERVICE BY VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME AND SHARING TALENT THAT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND ELSEWHERE. ANY REPORTS THEY PRODUCE ARE FORWARDED TO THE RESPECTIVE STATE BODY THAT WILL DEBATE AND TAKE ANY VOTES NECESSARY. WITH US TODAY IS SEVEN BORN SEEN A PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY. AND MEMBER OF THE PETROLEUM MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN YOU TODAY. I SERVED ON THE. PETROLEUM MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION I'M CURRENTLY ON THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S ADVISORY COUNCIL PRIOR TO THAT I WAS ON THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. MISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THESE ARE ALL COMMITTEES MADE UP OF. COMMISSIONERS WERE VOLUNTEERS. AND IN THE CASE OF THE WHO RECEIVE NO COMPENSATION OR REIMBURSEMENT. IN THE CASE OF THE P. MAC OF THE PETROLEUM MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE HAD FIVE MEMBERS FREE IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO SAN FRANCISCO PALO ALTO IN BERKELEY. SO WE HAD TO COME TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS ON IN OUR WORK. WE BELIEVE VERY MUCH IN PUBLIC ACCESS OBSERVATION AND PARTICIPATION. BUT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BAGLEY KEENE ACT. GREATLY HAMPERED THE OPERATION OF THE COMMITTEE. I'LL JUST GIVE YOU TWO QUICK EXAMPLES WHY ARE MEMBER IN LOS ANGELES HIS FLIGHT WAS CANCELED ONE MORNING. WHEN HE WAS COMING UP FROM LA. AS A RESULT HE WAS UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE HE COULD HAVE CALLED THE END BUT BAGLEY KEENE DOES NOT PERMIT THAT. ON ANOTHER CASE I WAS QUITE SICK. I ACTUALLY DID MANAGE TO DRIVE UP FROM BERKELEY BUT. HAD I TRIED TO PARTICIPATE WELL THOSE TOO LATE IT WAS INSIDE THE NOTICE PERIOD. AND I WOULD HAVE HAD TO OPEN UP MY. BEDROOM WHERE I WAS TO THE PUBLIC IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE BY PHONE. I THINK THERE ARE REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE IN BAGLEY KEENE WHILE STILL GUARANTEEING PUBLIC ACCESS AND PARTICIPATION. AND AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY EIGHT TAKES A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE MORE CHANGES THAN ARE IN THIS BILL BUT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD START FIRST START. AND I HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT IT. OKAY DO HAVE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE I DON'T. SEEING SOME. NO ANY. TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM HE WORKED FOR THE% CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR CORK FOR CONSIDERING. OUR CONCERNS THAT WE'VE RAISED. BUT SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL. AND. EXCUSE ME THE THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ON TO MAKE THE BILL. A LITTLE BIT BETTER. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. BUT WE WE DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY ADVISORY COMMITTEES SHOULD BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY UNDER THE LAW. THAN ANY OTHER BODY THAT IS SUBJECT TO BAGLEY KEENE. AND IN FACT OF THE BILL. HAS WOULD BE AMENDED BY THIS COMMITTEE WOULD STILL CREATE. A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE. UNNOTICED IT'S REQUIRED TO BE PUT UP TEN DAYS PRIOR TO THE BODY MEETING. AND THEN ANOTHER NOTICE COMING OUT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS I DON'T FIND LOCATIONS WHERE. PARTICIPANTS COULD. CALLING FROM REMOTELY OR PARTICIPATE VIA INTERNET REMOTELY. OUR WE THINK THAT'S CONFUSING TO THE PUBLIC AND UNDERMINES THE. HALLMARK PORTION THE BAGLEY KEENE ACT WHICH PROVIDES A PUBLIC WITH ADVANCE NOTICE OF WHAT IT IS THAT THE BODY IS. DO. WHEN THE TELECONFERENCE PROVISION WAS WRITTEN. DECADES AGO. IT WAS DONE SO IN ON. WITH THE PURPOSE OF ALLOWING PARTICIPATING MEMBERS TO. NOT MISS MEETINGS AND FOR THE BODY TO ACTUALLY DO ITS WORK. FOR SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT MISTER BORN STEAM. GAVE EARLIER. I MEAN BIG THE UNLESS THEY PHYSICALLY MET IN ONE LOCATION ARE NONE OF THOSE BODIES COULD ACTUALLY GET ANY WORK DONE SO THE TELECONFERENCING PROVISION WAS INTRODUCED AS A CONCEPT. WELL BUT IN DOING SO ALSO BALANCED BLUE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC TO ACCESS NOT ONLY THE INFORMATION BUT THE ARM ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SESSIONS INCLUDING. PARTICIPATING FROM THE REMOTE LOCATIONS WHERE THOSE MEMBERS OF A BADLY CAME BODIES WERE LOCATED. WE THINK THAT STILL THE BEST WAY FOR ON THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE WE'VE WE EMBRACE SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT MISTER QUIRK IS RAISED ABOUT A PROVIDING INTERNET ACCESS. REQUIRING A QUORUM TO BE. OUR PRESENT IN A PHYSICAL LOCATION OF THOSE ARE GREAT IDEAS BUT I'LL NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF UNDERMINING SOME OF THE EARLIER. UP PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE BILL'S ARM AND FOR THAT REASON. WE RESPECTFULLY URGENT NO VOTE. OKAY ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING THEM WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS ARE FOR QUESTIONS AND. MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I THINK AND I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA IS SORELY BEHIND IN USING MODERN TECHNOLOGY. I MEAN THE WAY PEOPLE COMMUNICATE NOW IS. ONLINE TWITTER I MEAN THERE. IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD AND I THINK UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ITSELF SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN AT EVERY MEETING. ALLOWING PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE AND I WOULD EVEN SAY PHONING MEMBERS THERE SOMETIMES WHEN THE WEATHER IS PROHIBITIVE PEOPLE GETTING THE MEETINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE THAT WAY SAW. I'M IN FAVOR.% MISTER QUIRK APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT. UP THANK YOU. I WAS PREPARED TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT TAKING THOSE I THINK THEY MAKE. I'LL SOME STRATEGIC SENSE AND FOR THE JAVA FROM THE NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION I'M A LITTLE BIT LOST. WHICH. A YOU MAY BE COMING WITH AND THAT IS. IF IS ALREADY A QUORUM PRESENT AND I'M AT A PHYSICAL LOCATION WHERE THE PUBLIC WAS ABLE TO ATTEND. THIS ROOM FOR EXAMPLE. THEY ALREADY KNEW THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO GO THEY PLAN ON GOING TO THAT ANY HOW DOES. IF IT WE NEED ELEVEN HOW DOES THE FOR QUORUM HERE HOW DOES THE TWELFTH THIRTEENTH FOURTEENTH PERSON WE HAVE A QUORUM WE'RE HERE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE ARE HERE. HOW DOES THE TWELFTH THIRTEENTH OR FOURTEENTH PERSON WHO'S AT HOME SICK IN BED SITTING IN AN AIRPORT LOUNGE BECAUSE THE PLANE STILL DELAYED ITS HATCHER HOW DOES THAT? NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET THE INFORMATION AND AM POCKET OPINED ON THAT. WHATEVER'S BUT THE BEFORE THE BOARD AGAIN THESE ARE ADVISORY BOARDS ON TOP OF IT THE ONLY MEMORY VOTING. ABILITY IN TERMS OF OUT OF POLICY OR LAW. WHERE WHERE IS THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE TO THE PUBLIC AT WELL? UNDER CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW THE LOCATIONS WHERE. THE MEMBERS PARTICIPATE FROM REMOTELY. BOB HAVE TO BE. ACCESSIBLE BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO MAY ALSO WANT TO BE. WHO MAY ALSO WANT TO PARTICIPATE? ARE IN THE MEETING ITSELF. ARE AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE STILL AREAS OF THE STATE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. BOB AND SO THIS WAS DESIGNED WITH THAT IN MIND. MOREOVER. EIGHT. THIS BILL PROBABLY WOULDN'T ADDRESS THE SITUATION MISTER BORENSTEIN ARRANGED WHERE THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY IN. A MEMBER. BECAUSE THEY'RE HIS. PLANE WAS CANCELED HER HIS HIS FLIGHT WAS CANCELED BECAUSE IT WOULD STILL REQUIRE TWENTY FOUR OUR NOTICE. BUT IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU KNOW. THEY HAVE OTHER JOBS THERE THEY'RE WORKING ON THEIR TRAVELING FOR THOSE JOBS. AND IF A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WANTED TO TAKE PLACE TAKE PART IN A PROCEEDING ESPECIALLY IN A BODY THAT COVERS. GENERAL YES THE ENTIRE STATE. IT GIVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. WITH RESPECT TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ADVISORY BODIES AND OTHER. TYPES OF. BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE BAGLEY KEENE ACT. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF POLICY IS DEVELOPED AT THE ADVISORY LEVEL AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE HERE AND PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS. AS THAT POLICY IS BEING DEVELOPED AND SO THAT'S WHY RIVER REALLY DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR THE DISTINCTION. BETWEEN AN ADVISORY BODY AND AND OTHER COVERED BY THE AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH I. YOU CAN TAKE A LITTLE EXCEPTION WITH S. AREAS THE STATE THAT DON'T HAVE ANY INTERNET ACCESS THEY MAY NOT HAVE. YOU KNOW. OF FULL T. ONE LINES BUT I TRAVEL QUITE EXTENSIVELY IN THE STATE UNLESS YOU'RE ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP. I DON'T SEE WHAT WERE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS IN MOST CASES OBVIOUSLY THERE'S EXTREME CASES. ORDERS BREAKDOWNS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ETCETERA BUT BUT AGAIN I'M I'M JUST HAVING TROUBLE GRAPPLING WITH. THAT THE MEETING WAS NOTICED TO BE IN THIS ROOM. THIS GENTLEMAN'S OUT SICK. WHY CAN HE NOT PARTICIPATE SO I'M GOING TO DIRECT AGAIN OUT OF YOUR TO ANSWER THE QUESTION? AGOG DRIVE TO BACK TO THE AUTHOR OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR MEETING NOTICE IS IS SOMETHING THAT HE BROUGHT UP THAT MIGHT BE A VALID POINT. IT TWENTY FOUR HOUR NOTICE IS OUR TWENTY FOUR HOUR NOTICE STILL PROVISION IN HERE I MEAN AND IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS. SO. THE SAMPLE THAT HE GAVE THE UNIT IN FAIRNESS TO UP TO THE JOHN FROM THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. IS A VALID POINT. BUT ILLNESS AND OTHER THINGS OBVIOUSLY WEATHER DELAYS IN ME. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO I I I I. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A PERFECT BILL. THERE'S NO SUCH THING. THEY APPRECIATE THE NOT ANY AFFIRMATIVE. MISTER QUIRK FOR THE RECORD HE SAID IF YOU CAN'T AT ME LOOKING AT MY BLOG INSTEAD OF YOUR. YOUR HEAD. NODDING. I STILL THINK THAT IT IN IN THE BIG PICTURE THAT. IT'S SUPPORTABLE. MAYBE THIS WAY SINCE WE GET LATER ON I DO APPRECIATE SIR. WITH ALL RESPECT AYE YOUR YOUR POINTS OF VIEW I WANT THE PUBLIC TO BE. COMPLETELY A MADE AWARE AND I KNOW MR QUIRK AND I KNOW MR CRIME BEEN A LOT OF COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS AND. MISTER QUIRK AND HE IS PROBABLY HANNAH AS BIG AS ALEC FOR THE PUBLIC HAVING INFORMATION AS AS I'VE FOUND IN THIS BODY. AND ALL I WOULD AGREE HIS ON HIS GUEST SPEAKER HERE MISTER BERMAN. AS WELL BUT. I I THINK JUST UP THE POINT TO BE MADE HERE IS YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE CANNOT. DRAG PEOPLE KICKING AND SCREAMING. INTO THE TWENTY FIRST AND TWENTY SECOND CENTURY OF THERE BUT A LOT OF TIMES WHEN. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE MORE BECAUSE THAT FORMS AND MAX OF THE MEETING IS GOING TO GO ON WITH THE WITHOUT THE GUY WITH THE BROKEN DOWN AIRPLANE OR THE. YOU KNOW THE ILLNESS THAT MEETING STILL GOING ON NOW WE ADD ANOTHER VOICE. A PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVE SOMEONE WHO'S IN A DIFFERENT AREA OF THE CUT OF THE STATE THAT NOW WILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO. I I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN AND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE AUTHOR AND HIS SON HIS GUEST SPEAKER I WAS CALLED A MANNEQUIN BUT I'D WANT TO BE RUDE TO IT BUT YOU DID A GREAT JOB TO BERMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU SIR AND I I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. LITTLE HESITATION BUT BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHICH BIGELOW. THANK YOU OUGHT TO THE AUTHOR. LIKE THE DIRECTION THAT YOU BILLS GOING IN SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU MAYBE IT'S A MORE. FRAMED AS AS A REQUEST AS A THOUGHT IN AND AS A PREDICATE WERE MY POSITIONAL BE ON THE BILL. SO UNDERSTAND THAT I'LL SUPPORT YOUR BILL MOVED AS IT WAS FOR TODAY. BUT I'M WONDERING WHAT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT ARE BEING PRESENTED HERE WOULD BE WISE FOR US TO. HAVE LIKE. A WINDOW THAT WE COULD REVIEW THIS AND SEE HOW. WE CAN CATEGORIZE THIS AS A SUCCESS STORY OF UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY AND ALLOW ESTABLISH A SENSE OF. OPPORTUNITY. FIVE YEARS FROM NOW AND THE INFORMATION OF THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF. HOW THIS WAS UTILIZED? AS A TOOL. FOR THE MEETINGS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD SET IN PLACE IN MOTION. SOME DIRECTION WHERE WE COULD ACTUALLY BROADEN THE SCOPE OF. AS THIS MOVES FORWARD FOR A FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. TO HELP US. WOULD THAT BE HELPFUL TO YOU WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH THAT. I ATTACK I THINK WHAT'S YOUR QUIRK IS SAYING IS HE BE HAPPY TO CHAT WITH YOU WANT TO GET HIS VOICE BACK. I UNDERSTAND THAT AND APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT I WOULD BE WILLING. YEAH. YES THEY ARE VISIBLE INTERPRETER CLAIRVOYANCE. SO IMPRESSIVE YEAH. SO ALL EXCEPT THAT IT'S A WILLINGNESS AND I'LL GET WITH YOU A ONE OFF I KNOW THIS IS JUST OFF THE OFF THE CUFF HERE BUT WE. IT'S KIND OF COMMITTING. A LITTLE BIT HERE IT SEEMS LIKE THAT MIGHT BE. DOABLE SITUATION. OKAY. WHICH GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING HIS. THIS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY I THINK BEFORE US AND SIR NABLUS'S COMMENTS. I DON'T SEE HOW THE PUBLIC WOULD BE DISENFRANCHISED BY WHAT THEY WERE TO COME TO ME THEY DON'T COME TO A MEETING. AND GIVEN THAT GIVEN THE SITUATION WHERE I'M REMINDED WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL IN. A NEIGHBORING CITY. COUNCIL MEMBER WAS CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY ACTIVE DUTY IN IRAQ. AND LAW CAME TO HIS BODY TO SUE A LOT BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED BECAUSE ITS CITY COUNCIL'S CHARTER SAYS IF YOU MEET. MS ON CONSECUTIVE MEETINGS. AND HE TRIED EVERYTHING AND ALSO TO THE POINT WHERE. THE MARINES WERE ALLOWING DESCRIBED IN TO THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING SO HE CAN BUILD HIS RESPONSIBILITIES KNOWLEDGE OF THIS NATION. AS AN ARMY LISTED BUT ALSO TO THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM. AND THAT. YOU KNOW DO THE LAW WAS CHANGED TO MAKE SOME ACCOMODATIONS AND. IN A AND IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY BUT IN THIS PURSUIT DISK TOOK A SITUATION. GOING TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO MADE. GAVE GETS GIVEN EXAMPLE IF A QUORUM IS MET. AND INDIVIDUAL A MEMBER WANTS TO. NOT CANNOT BE THAT WHATEVER REASON BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO. COME IN USING MODERN TECHNOLOGY I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING THE RATIONALE WHY SOMEONE WILL OBJECT TO THAT. THE PERSON IS APPEALING HIS ROUTE HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY. AND I UNDERSTAND POLICIES ARE BEING MADE BUT THE PERSON WHO IS USING A MODERN TECHNOLOGY WAS PHYSICALLY CANNOT BE THERE. IS LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION IS IS IS POSSIBLY PROVIDING SOME GUIDANCE INTO THE CONVERSATION BUT NOT BEING ALLOWED. TO VOTE IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT IS. YOUR COMMENTS IS GOING A LITTLE BIT. ANYWAY I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GOING HOUSES OR SOMETHING ELSE I'M. I THINK I'M I'M A HOLD ON THE. LECTURE QUESTION WORKERS WELL WELL I'M. CLEAN YET COMPLEX ARE MISTER CHAIR. THE GLOVES. A PERHAPS MIGHT MIGHT POSITIONS LITTLE. MISSTATED. WE DON'T OPPOSE ANY OF THE ADDITIONAL. ARE FEATURES THAT MR CORKER'S PROPOSING IN THIS HOTEL OKAY. MORE TECHNOLOGY IS MUCH BETTER WE AGREE WITH ALL OF THOSE THINGS. WE JUST DON'T LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AT THE EXPENSE OF SOME OF THE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN THE LAW THAT DO ALLOW PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE UNDER CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW. BY TELEPHONE BY THE INTERNET WHATEVER. WERE SAYING THAT THE NOTICE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT THE. LACK OF ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC TO BE LOCATED AT THE LOCATION WHERE MEMBERS PARTICIPATING SHOULD NOT BE ELIMINATED. JUST BECAUSE WE'RE ADDING TECHNOLOGY TO IT NOW I DOUBT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ANYBODY PARTICIPATING FROM IRAQ. BUT THEY MIGHT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION WHERE A MEMBER IS PARTICIPATING WHEN THEY'RE ON BUSINESS. AND THEY SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT AT THAT LOCATION WHICH CURRENT LAW PROVIDS. THANK YOU. NUMBER FOLLOW. YOU KNOW. STRUCTURE QUESTIONS IN MY MIND UP. I DID THAT SEEMS INCONSISTENT THAT YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THE PURPOSE OF THE LOCATION WAS IN FACT THAT THERE WASN'T TECHNOLOGIES SOMEONE WOULD NEED TO GO TO THAT LOOK. WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION TECHNOLOGY THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE AND THEREFORE APPROPRIATE. FOR SOME REFORM. AND. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT? WELL AGAIN TO TO. ARM ALLOW FULL PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THERE MAY BE SOME PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. A COMPUTER OR SMARTPHONE OR A VERY BAD HAS ACCESS TO. THE LOCATION. BECAUSE THE THE BODY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PUT OUT NOTICE TEN DAYS PRIOR TO ITS MEETING IDENTIFYING EACH OF LOCATIONS WHERE. PEOPLE WILL BE PARTICIPATING FROM REMOTELY BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THEY DON'T NEED TO GO TO EACH OF THE LOCATIONS THEY NEED TO GO TO THE ONE LOCATION THAT IS CENTRAL TO THE MEETING. WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND IS REFORM IN THE BILL SHOOT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT YES ARM BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STATEWIDE BODIES AND SO IT MAY NOT BE EASY FOR. SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN IMPERIAL COUNTY TO ATTEND A MEETING WHERE THE PHYSICAL LOCATION IS IN SACRAMENTO I MEAN HAVING SAID THAT YOU WOULD DEBT LIMIT THIS TO ADVISORY BODIES OF. AND OF COURSE WHEN I ASKED FOR. ADDITIONALLY A QUORUM AND. I THINK WE'VE MADE SOME GOOD AMENDMENTS TOWARDS THAT END I WOULD AGREE WITH NOT SURE I AGREE WITH. THE CONTINUED A POSITION OF OPPOSE A ON THIS BILL. I ALSO ASK YOU KNOW WE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR. AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX VERY SIMILAR THAT THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WAS NOT OPPOSITION TO DID ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME THING DO YOU HAVE ANY ERA CAN YOU WE WORKED OUT A. YELL THAT WOULD THAT DON'T WITH AGRICULTURAL BODIES WHERE THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ONE MEETING. IN VERY REMOTE LOCATIONS ON FARMS AND THE LIKE AND FOR A VERY SPECIFIC NEED. WE NEGOTIATED WITH. THE AVOCADO COMMISSION AND THE OTHERS THAT BROUGHT THAT FORWARD ON THAT VERY NARROW EXEMPTION. SO COMPROMISE PERHAPS IN SUCH EXACTLY WHAT RARE EXCEPTIONS YOU'RE BY. RIGHT BUT THIS WILL BE MUCH BROADER THAT WAS JUST VERY STATED SPECIFIC NARROW NEED ON ON THIS WOULD BE MUCH BROADER WOULD OR I DON'T HAVE A POST THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE. THAT WERE TAKEN HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE I'M SORRY. LIMITED. WHERE THE BILL WAS THE SCOPE TO THE AMENDED VERSION COMING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE YOU'D AGREE WITH THAT? SOME EXTENT YES.

YES I DO PRESENT I DID HEAR A MOTION. AND I BELIEVE MY PARTICIPANT I THINK I MISTER GIBSON MADE THE MOTION RUBIO GAVE THE SACK AND. WELL I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ENTHUSIASM THE IDEA WHAT WHAT I'D LIKE ASIAN YES BECAUSE. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST SAY AT LEAST I'M A JOINT HERE BY MR EVAN RELEASE ON BEHALF OF THE SEISMIC RESILIENCE INITIATIVE? AND ATTORNEY LESS LOW BAR. AND. I'LL JUST KEEP IT BRIEF AND SAY THAT. A GIVEN ALL THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY WE'VE BEEN SEEING AROUND THE WORLD WE JUST NEEDED TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS. AND UP BOTH LOOKING FORWARD AND LOOKING BACKWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE BUILDINGS THAT WILL NOT BE VULNERABLE AND BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN ANY GREAT LEVEL OF SEISMIC ACTIVITY TAKING PLACE. SO ESPECIALLY ALONG THE COAST THE LINES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF FOCUS SO WITH THAT. MISTER REISS. I THINK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SWITCHED AYE HELLO MY NAME IS EVAN RACE AND I AM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE U. S. RESILIENCY CAO. I AM PLEASED TO JOIN YOU HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY ONE. IS NOT LOST ON ME THAT TODAY IS A HUNDRED TWELFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MOST DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE TO STRIKE OUR STATE. IT IS THEREFORE APPROPRIATE THAT THIS COMMITTEE I CONSIDERING A BILL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO SAFER CITIES. PROTECTING OUR RESIDENTS AND ECONOMY. AS THE CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT THE U. S. R. C.'S MISSION IS TO EDUCATE ADVOCATE AND PROMOTE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF BUILDING PERFORMANCE IN EARTHQUAKES. EVERY BUILDING OWNER IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS THAT WE LIVE IN EARTHQUAKE COUNTRY AND MOST ARE AWARE OF THE DEVASTATION THAT CAN OCCUR IN ADVANCE LIKE THOSE IN LOS ANGELES NAPA EUREKA. AND OF COURSE SAN FRANCISCO ON THIS DATE IN NINETEEN OH SIX. THE U. S. RC BELIEVES THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE BUILDINGS THEY OWN BY CELL LIVE OR WORK IN. AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY ONE BUILDS ON SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CSU SYSTEMS AND SEVERAL CITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES BASIN AND SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS ARE MODEST IN COST TO THE STATE BUT MEANINGFUL IN IMPACT SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO HAVE LED BUILDING OWNERS TO BE PROACTIVE IN MITIGATING AND RETROFITTING VULNERABLE BUILDINGS. IMPROVING THE RESILIENCE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES INCREASING THEIR PROPERTIES VALUE AND DECREASING THEIR RISKS. I MIGHT JUST ADD THAT ON MY WAY UP FROM THE PENINSULA TODAY I STOPPED OFF ON A CITY IN THE EAST BAY. CLIENT OF MINE THAT THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS OF THIS CITY ASKED ME TO LOOK AT TWO OF THESE BUILDINGS. ONE WAS A COMMUNITY CENTER IN WHICH DOZENS OF CHILDREN RESIDE EVERYDAY AND WHICH WILL BE COUNTED ON TO BE A. SHELTER AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE THE OTHER WAS THE DISPATCH CENTER BASICALLY THE NINE ELEVEN CALL CENTER FOR FIRE AND AND POLICE A BUILDING THAT'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT CITY AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE. TURNS OUT BOTH OF THOSE BUILDINGS WERE OLDER CONCRETE BLOCK BUILDINGS WITH WOOD ROOFS PRECISELY THE TYPE OF BUILDINGS THAT NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL. TO MADE ALL MORE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE RESILIENCE OF THE CITY'S IS GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL. MANY OF OUR STATES MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS LIVE IN BUILDINGS THAT ARE THREATENED SELVES HIGHLY VULNERABLE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A PARTICULAR CONCERN MORE THAN FORTY NINE THOUSAND APARTMENT UNITS WERE RENDERED UNINHABITABLE FOLLOWING THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. AT A TIME WHEN OUR LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING NEW WAYS TO ADD AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK STATEWIDE. WE BELIEVE IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO WORK TOWARD PROTECTING THE HOUSING WE CURRENTLY HAVE. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE ENGINE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY YET MANY ARE ALSO AT RISK AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY ONE WILL PROVIDE VITAL INFORMATION TO BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. TO USE IN DEVELOPING INCENTIVE AND PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS TO RESTORE FUNCTIONALITY. AND PER SERVE JOBS AFTER ANOTHER MAJOR SEISMIC EVENT THIS IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF RESILIENCE. SO THEREFORE I BELIEVE THAT AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY ONE DEMONSTRATES THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO A SAFER. MORE RESILIENT CALIFORNIA FOR ALL OF ITS RESIDENTS AND I URGE ITS ADOPTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PRESENTED WILL TRY TO KEEP THESE BRIEF YOU KNOW. DOWN TO ABOUT A MINUTE HAVE TWO MINUTES. WE KNOW YOU HAVE NUMBER OF PRESENTERS. SIR HAS GOT TO BE VERY BRIEF MIGHT MY NAME IS LES LOW BUT I'M AN ATTORNEY FOR THE LAST FOUR DECADES SPECIALIZED IN ENERGY. ENVIRONMENTAL RESILIENCY KINDS OF THINGS AS WELL AS BUSINESS. ALSO PRESENT OF A COMPANY CALLED ET HE CUBA OPTIMIZERS WHICH DEALS WITH. ENERGY ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONSULTING. I'VE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE U. S. GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL OF FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR SO. AND HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF TIME WITH THEM IN TERMS OF RESILIENCY. DID A SIX MONTH STUDY OF THE CITY OF BOSTON. DOING DEVELOPING A CASE STUDY ON RESILIENCY IN BOSTON WE LOOKED AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMSA HORIZONTAL VERTICAL INFASTRUCTURE. BUT WE ALSO LOOKED AT THINGS IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN ASPECTS SOCIAL EQUITY ISSUES ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. EDUCATIONAL ISSUES POLICE DEPARTMENT FIRE DEPARTMENT SO FORTH. WHAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE LEARNED IN LOOKING AT RESILIENCY IS THAT IS THE HUMAN ELEMENTS IN THE RESILIENCY THE PEOPLE THAT DETERMINE WHETHER DOT THE CITY OF BUILDING A COUNTRY? COUNTY OR WHATEVER OUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE RESILIENT. I SECOND THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. I JUST BEFORE ME AND THAT WE ALSO LEARNED THAT. THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE MOST DISADVANTAGED OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE. LEAST ABLE AND LEAST LIKELY TO BE A RECOVER FROM MAJOR DISASTERS IN THE CASE OF BOSTON THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY. THINGS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE WHETHER ISSUES HURRICANES AND UNFORTUNATELY TERRORISM. AND CALIFORNIA IT'S REALLY EARTHQUAKES. AND IF WE HAD THE MAJOR WE WILL HAVE THE MAJOR EARTHQUAKE EVENTUALLY THE KIND OF DISASTER SOCIAL EIGHT THAT. IS REALLY TERRIFYING IS NOT JUST THE HUMAN LOSS OF LIFE THAT WILL CURB WE DON'T GET AND DO SOMETHING DRAMATIC SOON. IT IS ALSO THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE THE THE QUANTITY OF RUBBLE THAT WOULD BE RESULT FROM THAT FROM STATS I'VE SEEN WOULD FILL ALL THE LANDFILLS CALIFORNIAN PROBABLY. MAJORITY LANDFILLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THAT WOULD BE HORRENDOUS IN ADDITION YOU HAVE THE CONTAMINATION THE AIR IN THE SOIL IN THE WALK THE RESULT FROM THE KIND OF EARTHQUAKE. YOU HAVE AN ECONOMIC SPIRAL THAT WOULD OCCUR BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED WHO LIVE IN THIS KIND OF HOMES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WORK LOT OF THEM. AND MADE THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE THE BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY THOSE PEOPLE ALSO WILL GO DOWN. CALIFORNIA IS A SIX LARGER SEEK ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BUT IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THAT KIND OF DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY. WITHOUT A REPERCUSSION TO GO TO THE STATE AND PABLO POSSIBLY THE NATION AS WELL. I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE KNOW WE CAN DO TO MITIGATE THAT KIND OF A WRECK FEET DAMAGE. AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE THE COURAGE AND WILL TO DO THAT TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION. I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE U. S. GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL HAS ASKED ME TO INFORM YOU THAT IT VERY VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS LEGISLATION.

FIREFIGHTERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE WORKED TO FIGHT THESE FIRES AND THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE A PRIVATELY CONTRACTED FIRE RESOURCES. THIS PART CONFUSION AND QUESTIONS REGARDING HOW PRIVATE RESOURCES INTERACT WITH STATE AND LOCAL RESOURCES. REPORTS INDICATED THE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS AND THEIR EQUIPMENT WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THAT OF THE PUBLIC FIREFIGHTING AGENCIES. BY DEVELOPING STANDARD GUIDELINES FOR COMMUNICATION IDENTIFICATION AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY WILL PUT AN END. TO PUBLIC CONFUSION ABOUT WHETHER FIRE RESOURCES ARE PUBLIC FIRST RESPONDERS ARE PRIVATELY CONTRACT FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE AND STRENGTHEN OVERALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE STANDARDS TO BENEFIT ALL FIRE RESOURCES.

PREVIOUS GUIDELINES THAT WERE DEVELOPED BY FIRE SCOPE WHICH IS A BODY THAT BRINGS ABOUT VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE FIRE SERVICE TOGETHER TO TALK THROUGH THESE COORDINATION OF RESPONSE ISSUES.
