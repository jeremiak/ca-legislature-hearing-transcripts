HI WE HAVE A QUORUM. MISTER ROUGHLY CALL THE ROLL. WELCOME SIR DRAWS OF PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. OKAY. RIGHT RENDON MANAGER- MEDICARE MEMBERS WITH. MULLIN SHOT INTO WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A LONG SLUGGISH RECOVERY FOR THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WITHOUT INCREASING THE NET COST TO TAXPAYERS IT WOULD MAKE THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO LARGE COMPANIES WILLING TO LOCATE BUILD AND EXPAND MEDIA PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA AS LONG AS THEY CAN COMMIT TO CREATING FIVE THOUSAND FULL TIME JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. GOING FORWARD FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMITMENT TO HIGH WAGE HIGH SKILL JOBS. I BELIEVE WITH THE RIGHT INCENTIVES COMPANIES ARE READY TO EXPAND IN OUR STATE AND KEEP CALIFORNIA THE MEDIA AND CONTENT PRODUCTION CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. IN EXCHANGE THIS BILL ALLOWS THOSE CAL COMPETES AWARD HE'S- WILLING TO MEET THESE CRTERIA TO APPLY ALL OR PART OF THE LORD TO OFFSET AGAINST ITS TOTAL STATE TAX LIABILITY. TO BE CLEAR NO ONE COMPANY OR INDUSTRY IS GUARANTEED A CALICO PETE'S AWARD UNDER THIS BILL. COMPANIES MUST STILL APPLY MAKE THEIR CASE AND UNDERGO THE USUAL COMPETITIVE PROCESS ORTIZ WAS STILL DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH GO BIZ AND UNDERGO IF TO BE AUDITS. IN THE END IF SB FIFTY ONE REPRESENTS A GREAT DEAL FOR WORKERS AND A HUGE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC WIN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT INCREASING COSTS TO TAXPAYERS IT PROVIDES TAX FLEXIBILITY WITH AN EXISTING PROGRAM IN EXCHANGE FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITMENT AND THOUSANDS OF NEW HIGH WAGE FULL TIME JOBS.

NOW IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE DR CORK. WELL IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S IN THE BILL JUST BECAUSE IT COMES UP LATE I'M JUST READING THE MALICE IS NOW. BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS THESE FIVE THOUSAND JOBS. IS THAT MEAN FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS OR DOES IT SEEM FIVE THOUSAND JOBS AND CONTINUE FOR TEN YEARS. SO IF I HAVE AN ENTERPRISE AND I'VE DONE THIS AND I. HAVE FIVE THOUSAND JOBS ONE DAY ONE- AND THEY PROCESS FOR TEN YEARS WITHOUT SATISFIED OR DO THEY NEED TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL. FIVE THOUSAND EVERY YEAR OR MAYBE IT AND HIGHER FIFTY THOUSAND. YES IS. AS FAR AS I- I SEE IT THE AUTHORITIES MUST COMMIT TO CREATING FIVE THOUSAND OF FULL TIME JOBS IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR. SO IF THEY DO FIVE THOUSAND SO IT WOULD BE FIFTY THOUSAND SO THEY HAVE TO GO FROM WHATEVER THEY HAVE NW FIVE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND. TWENTY THOUSAND INTERVENTION OF REACH FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WELL IT'S FIVE THOUSAND EVERY YEAR. WELL EVERY YEAR I'M NOT SO DOCTOR PARK I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF YOU WILL WERE TALKING ABOUT WILL BE IN THE LETTER TO CLARIFY AS WE'RE NOT IT IS A AND IT IS NOT CLEAR IN THE BILL IF THAT IS FIVE THOUSAND RE HIRES OF THAT FIVE THOUSAND NEW JOBS SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT WHEN THEY SEE ABOUT THE LETTER TO THE JOURNAL THAT IS TO BE CLARIFIED IN THAT LETTER. OFTEN WHETHER OR NOT I DO. I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE A COPY OF THAT LETTER WHENEVER COPY OF A LETTER CONTAINS DOWN. HAVEN'T READ TO US. I WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT AND DR CORRECT YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION OR WE CAN MOVE ON AND THEN COME BACK TO DR CORPUS MORE WILL MOVE ON OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THE LETTER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK MADAM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SWANA THANK THE SENATOR AND- MISTER CALDERON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I KNOW IT'S KIND OF LAST MINUTE BUT RIGHT NOW WITH CODE AND EVERYTHING ELSE WE DEFINITELY MADE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING JOBS- IN A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT- INYO COUNTY WHICH HAPPENS TO BE IN MY DISTRICT WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE- BACK LOT FOR HOLLYWOOD'S WHO ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL- AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MOTION. TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS CONCERNS IT'S PETRIE-NORRIS. THE SENATOR- I FIND MYSELF A LITTLE BIT CONFLICTED- BECAUSE I LIKE MISTER MATHIS COMMEND YOU FOR THIS FILM TO TRY TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY TO CREATE JOBS COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE THAT WE NEED AN ADRENALINE SHOT IN THE ARM AT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY I GUESS I'M CONFUSED ABOUT IS WHY IS THIS RESTRICTED. TO ONLY COMPANIES. THAT ENGAGE IN MEDIA PRODUCTION. COULD WE- PRODUCTS YES I'LL EXPLAIN AS MUCH AS I CAN AND THEN MAYBE MISTER DAVIS OR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON WANT TO JUMP IN ONE IS THAT WE FOUND THAT THERE IS A GREAT NEED PRIOR TO THE OF PANDEMIC KIDDING ARE THERE WAS 95% OF USE THERE USING95% OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS OF THE RECORDING STUDIOS AND THIS PERMANENT YOU KNOW- INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE WERE GETTING READY TO JUST OUT- NOT BE IN A POSITION TO KEEP GROWING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO WE'RE GONNA LOSE PRODUCTION BECAUSE WE WERE NOT IN A POSITION TO KEEP IT HERE IN THE STATE SO IS VERY MUCH GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE COULD HAVE LOST THOSE JOBS OUT OF CALIFORNIA SO I KNOW THE PANDEMICS HIT BUT WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN BUILD THIS OVERNIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT WE KNOW WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TO CREATE FAR FAR MORE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WE WANT TO BE IN A POSITION TO KEEP CONTINUE TO BE THE CAPITAL OF ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE COUNTRY AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CAPITALS OF THE WORLD SO WE WANT TO BE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THE JOBS NOW AND BE READY AS THE BUSINESS PICKS UP FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB IT AND- SEOUL THAT'S ONE REASON I DID NOT- MISTER DAVIS IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT. THANK YOU LAW CENTER. YEAH WHAT ONE OF THE- ISSUE USERS APLIK WRECKED ON ON THE WANTING TO BE READY FOR- PRODUCTION ASSEMBLY THAT WE BELIEVE AND WHAT WAS THAT WOULD NOT BE COMING BACK. AFTER ON IT WE PASSED THIS. THIS THIS HORRIFIC. UP PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. THE PUT DOWN MAKE ON THAT THUNDER. WE ARE AT NEAR CAPACITY THE INDUSTRY. AND WE HAD UP MORE COMPANIES SPEAKING- TO COME YOUR DOCTOR COMPACT CALIFORNIA FROM OTHER STATES. SO IT IS NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. OF THIS. IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE THESE COMPANIES WHO ARE WILLING TO MAKE THIS TYPE COMMITMENT. pGROWTH OF TH JOBS IT ALSO MAKES A COMMITMENT TO THE STATE. AND I THINK THAT- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT. ANYTHING THAT THAT THE STATE CAN DO. WITH THE DOLLARS THAT ARE ALREADY ALLOCATED. IS TO HAVE THOSE INVESTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS GOING TO- COULD NOT JUST A PROMISE OF THE JOBS BUT THE GUARANTEE- IN ORDER TO FULFILL THE COMMITMENT ORDERS TO GET THE UP. IF THE SERBS. THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY CREATE THE JOB NOT JUST- YOU KNOW SAY THAT WELL IF WE DO THIS THEN THE JOBS ARE PROBABLY BE CREATED THIS IS AN ACTUAL COMMITMENT. OVER TIME. IN ON TO AN INDUSTRY THAT- IS SEARCH SYNONYMOUS WITH CALIFORNIA. AND WE BELIEVE. THAT THIS IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IDEA BUT I DON'T KNOW MISTER AT OUR- BURKE CALDERON IS GONNA THANK AYE PROJECTS ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT QUESTION I THINK IT SHOULD BE OPEN TO A LOT MORE INDUSTRIES ANYBODY WHO'S WILLING TO MAKE THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT THE STATE. THE KIND OF THERE'S TWO ISSUES THAT THE FIRST ISSUES IT IS YOU KNOW UNDERGO SEASONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I THINK YEAH AND THE ADMINISTRATION THIS IS KIND OF MORE THE FOLKS THAT THEY WANTED TO BE. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE OUR TAX CREDITS A LITTLE BIT MORE USEFUL AS TIME GOES ON. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT GROWTH- AND THIS IS A GREAT START TO THAT AND I THINK IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL WE CAN EXPAND THAT TO OTHER INDUSTRIES. BUT IT'S ALL WAS ALSO ASKED OF US BY CAL COMPETES THEMSELVES- IF WE COULD ALSO NARROW AND SPECIFIC TO THE INDUSTRY GIVEN WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE TYPES OF IN A TYPE OF INVESTMENT ITSELF. YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY THE LANGUAGE WAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE BROAD BUT THIS IS KIND OF WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH THROUGH THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS- BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD ENCOURAGE ESPECIALLY IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL WHICH I BELIEVE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. TO OPEN THAT UP- TO OTHER INDUSTRIES AND YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE MODERNIZATION OF OUR TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS. TO ALLOW THEM TO BE APPLICABLE AND RELEVANT AS WE MOVE ON TO BE ABLE TO FLY FOR BUSINESS IS STATES HERE TO KEEP THAT- KEEP THAT INVESTMENT. CONTINUALLY COMING TO CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'LL WANT THEY WILL WANT TO BE HERE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE TO MOVE TO OTHER STATES THERE'S HOT THERE'S COVERT REST ESPECIALLY WITHIN THIS INDUSTRY SO. THIS IS WHAT THE PRODUCTION OF YOU KNOW ALL A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS BEING INVOLVED. IN A VERY VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHY WE LANDED ON THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITIES GONNA BUT IT BRING A LOT OF ECONOMIC REVENUE. CERTAINLY WORTH DOING RIGHTNOW- AND THEN HOPEFULLY. EXPANDING LATER ON. DEMOCRATIC I THINK EVERYTHING EVERYTHING. A CENTER. THAT BUT YOU. TERMS OF FIFTEEN AND IMPORTANT. FOR US TO SUPPORT. A REALLY IMPORTANT HISTORY. AND EVERYTHING THAT. ABDOMINAL THE PHONE SAID. TOTALLY AGREE I THINK I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE THE REFUND ABILITY. AS THE C. C. T. C. LIKE. PROVIDE ANYONE WHO MEETS THAT CRITERIA BECAUSE WE NEED TO CREATE. WE NEED TO CREATE JOBS AND STIMULATE THIS ECONOMY NOT JUST IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WE NEED YEAH. CLEAN ENERGY. LIFE SCIENCES. AGRICULTURE RIGHT SO. I'M I HOPE THAT WE CAN. FIND A WAY. IT'S NOT IT'S I DON'T KNOW. I NOT A PART OF THIS ARE PART OF THE VOTE. INTERNET WORK. THAT CONVERTS. YEP IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE MORE THING IS. I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT YOU KNOW ALL I HAVE A- HISTORY OF WORKING WITH NOT ONLY THIS INDUSTRY BUT A LOT OF INDUSTRIES. WELL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENT IS GOING TO BE FOR HIGH WAGE JOBS. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE JOBS THAT NO WE COULD FAMILIES COULD REALLY. OF THE WORKERS COULD REALLY RAISE OUR FAMILIES WHAT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE COMPANY'S. I REALLY BELIEVE YOU KNOW A COMPANY'S PROMISE SHOULD BE LIVED UP TO. AND YOU KNOW TO HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE THAT'S GOING TO BE. AN ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY MEANS A LOT TO ME BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY PRECIOUS TAX DOLLARS. THANK YOU. MISTER AND- YEAH. BAKER PROBABLY HEARING BETTER THANK YOU. SENATOR SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE UNITED STATES SENATOR AND NOW VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES THIS COMMENT HAS CAME THROUGH MY DISTRICT. CAMPAIGNING AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT WITH HER- MYSELF CENTER GALGIANI FROM MY AREA. WITH SOME OF THE LEADERS IN THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. M. WE HAD A TABLE WE WENT AROUND THE ROOM AND EVERYBODY INTRODUCED THEMSELVES FROM POULTRY- ALMONDS PISTACHIOS AND OTHER CROPS. EVERY SINGLE PERSON ROOM INTRODUCED THEMSELVES TO THE SENATOR AS A SMALL FAMILY FARMERS. SO WHENEVER WE GOT DONE TALKING I SAID TO THE GROUP I SAID YOU KNOW WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY FRIENDS HERE MOSIS FOLKS IN THIS ROOM THESE INDUSTRY LEADERS ARE NOT SMALL FAMILY FARMERS THE PRETTY BIG FAMILY FOR. I SAID THAT THEY HAVE TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO YOU THAT WAY. BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'RE GREEDY CORPORATE FOR. I SAID ENOUGH I CAN DO YOUR DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO WOOD GOOGLE AND APPLE AND ALL THESE FOLKS INTRODUCED THEMSELVES TO ME A SMALL FAMILY TECH COMPANIES. THEY WOULDN'T BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO. I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT OUR FRIENDS IN LOS ANGELES ARE WE SMALL FAMILY PRODUCTION COMPANIES NO NO WE'RE NOT. BUT THERE'S DISCRIMINATORY ATTITUDES IN THIS BODY AND IN THE STATE AND MANY FROM OUR URBAN COLLEAGUES IN BOTH THE BAY AREA LOS ANGELES. SO SOME INDUSTRIES ARE GOOD SOME INDUSTRIES ARE BAD HERE WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE THROES. OF BLAST IS LEGISLATURE AND WALSH. YOU KNOW THE SENATE HASN'T HAD THE TIME TO TAKE TAPE UP THE VAPING TAX I WAS WORKING ON OVER THERE AT THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT MILITARY VETERANS CAN USE THEIR LICENSES TO. DO THEIR WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE FINDING TIME TO EXPAND CREDITS FOR HOLLYWOOD AND FOR LOS ANGELES. AND I UNDERSTAND YOU NOT SPEND NEW MONEY THAT I UNDERSTAND I'VE WORKED WITH THE SAME NUMBER CALDERON TO PASS ON SOME OF THESE BILLS NOT SUPPORTED THESE BILLS. IN THE PAST. BUT I'D BE RESIDENTS DID NOT. MAKE THE POINT THE POINT THAT MY COLLEAGUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS WAS MAKING WHICH IS. STARTS TO FEEL LIKE. IT'S ALWAYS AN EMERGENCY IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT WHAT L. A. NEED SOMETHING OR SAM CISCO NEED SOMETHING. IT IS NOT AS IMPORTANT WHEN THE REST OF US ITSELF AND SO A BROADER APPROACH TO SOME OF THESE- INCENTIVES AND TAX CREDITS AND DOING THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL INDUSTRIES FROM AGRICULTURE. TO A MOVIE PRODUCTIONS TO LIFE SCIENCES AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. AS BEST THEY CAN GET THROUGH THIS OBVIOUSLY. UNPRECEDENTED WORLD CRISIS THAT WE'RE ALL LIVING TO THIS ECONOMIC RECESSION THAT EXISTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND THERE'S ALWAYS PROMISES THAT WE'RE GONNA GET TAKEN CARE OF LATER AND THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER BILL AND THEN THE OTHER BILLS COMMON THEY EXPLAIN TO- THOSE OF US RURAL CALIFORNIA HOW ARE PRIORITIES DON'T QUITE MEET THE MARK ARE QUITE IMPORTANT TO GET AHEAD IN LIFE. SO I AGREE WITH THIS ON THIS POINT WHICH IS WE SHOULD BE BROADENING THIS IF IT CAN'T HAPPEN TODAY IN THIS COMMITTEE. MAYBE IT CAN HAPPEN. IN SOME OTHER BILLS PROBABLY NOT THIS YEAR I'M SURE AT THIS POINT I THINK WE'RE BEYOND THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR- MEHMET SO IT'S- THERE'S ALWAYS IF THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY ALTHOUGH I DOUBT THERE'S THE WILL TO FIND A WAY TO HELP THE REST OF US. BUT I'M GOING TO ATTEMPT TO APPEAL TO THE BETTER ANGELS OF MY NATURE HERE AND SUPPORT WHAT I KNOW IS A- EFFORT WITH MERIT TO HELP PEOPLE WORKING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO INCREASE AND MAINTAIN HIGH WAGE JOBS WHICH IS THE VALUE I KNOW WE ALL SHARE. AND WANT TO DOUBLE DOWN AND I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT WORK BUT- I JUST HAD TO TAKE A MOMENT TO. MAKE THE POINT SO THE NEXT TIME WE'RE STAND ON THE SENATE FLOOR. AND WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT PRIORITIES. THAT WE CAN ALL REMEMBER FROM ALL PARTS OF THE STATE THAT WE ALL HAVE PRIORITIES WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. AND WE ALL NEED HELP DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT. SOME OF MY ROOMMATES AND- JUST TO JUST TO WITH MY CON I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS TODAY I DON'T KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE IS A MOTION I'M GONNA SECOND THE MOTION IF IT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN SECOND- MADAM CHAIR- BUT I JUST WANTED TO- THE PIGGY BACK ON. MY COLLEAGUES FROM FROM MERCED SAYS COMMENTS- BECAUSE- IT'S TRUE IF YOU'RE IN AT IN IN AGRICULTURE- YOU CAN'T PICK UP. YOUR DIRT. AND MOVE IT TO ANOTHER STATE YOU ARE HERE. IT IS A FACT- THAT CALIFORNIA STACKS IS- ARE TOO HIGH- AND IT'S ALSO A FACT THAT OUR REGULATIONS ARE TOO ARE TOO DEEP- BUT WHAT IS ALSO A FACT IT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS. IS YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T TAKE YOUR PRODUCTION- ELSEWHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. AND MOVE IT AND MOVE IT ELSEWHERE I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH. OUR MAJORITY LEADER A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TELLING THE STORY. A FRIEND OF MINE- WHO IS A DIRECTOR- FOR ONE OF THE- FOR SEVERAL LARGE A FILM'S. ANY SPENDING IT OFF A LOT OF TIME IN ATLANTA GEORGIA- AND WHY IS IT THAT HE SPENDING TIME IN ATLANTA GEORGIA WELL BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA. I'M AS PROVIDED FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TAX CREDITS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE THAT BUSINESS- THAT WE HAVE HAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME TRYING TO TAKE IT. ELSEWHERE WE ARE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY AND WE HAVE TO BE COMPETITIVE SO WHILE I DON'T LIKE DOING THESE ONE OFFS IN FACT IT IS UP TO ME. I WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO WE WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT OUR ENTIRE- ARE TIRED TAX SYSTEM I WOULD LOOK AT THE WAY THAT WE- WE HAVE OUR REVENUE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO. TO PAY FOR OUR BILLS HERE IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD WANT TO REFORM ALL OF IT- BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION- AND IN FACT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY YET MY SIX YEARS THE LEGISLATURE. WANTING TO STEP UP AND GO AND GO DO THAT CALIFORNIA'S NOT COMPETITIVE SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BILLS LIKE THE ONE THAT'S BEFORE US- AND SUPPORT THINGS LIKE THIS I HOPE SOME DAY WE COME TO GRIPS THE FACT. THAT IT ISN'T JUST OF THE FILM INDUSTRY IS NOT JUST THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY BUT IT'S MANY INDUSTRIES THAT ARE SUFFERING. IN THE STATE- AND I KNOW AS WE GO THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN COMPANIES ARE LOOKING AT TRYING TO- TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE THIS GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. THOSE COMPANIES THINKING YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE ANY LONGER- WE'VE GOT- WE'VE YOU KNOW W'VE GOT ZOOM- NOW RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A PRESENCE HERE- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS STATE THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE TO START LOKING. AT AT OUR OVERALL POLICY IN REGARDS TO HOW WE DEAL WITH WITH REVENUE AND DEAL DO WITH REGULATIONS BUT FOR TENET TODAY THE BILL BEFORE. US IS THIS ONE I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU. FOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AND THEN I'M GONNA GIVE MINE FIRST SENATOR RAZA I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT- WORKERS ARE TO YOU AND I KNOW THEM AND WE HAVE SPOKEN RECENTLY HOW IMPORTANT ACCOUNTABILITY IS TO AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND TO SEND TO I JUST GIVEN UPGRADE CENTER- DOESN'T REMEMBER CALDERON I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SPENT. THE BULK OF YOUR TIME WORKING ON THESE ISSUES ESPECIALLY FROM THE MOTION PICTURE PICTURE INDUSTRY AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW MY DAUGHTER'S FATHER IS AYE AUSSIE. AND SO YOU KNOW I FIRSTHAND KNOW ABOUT FAMILIES BEING SEPARATED BECAUSE- OTHER STATES ARE OFFERING CREDITS TO PRODUCTION AND SO WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT HOWEVER I DO HAVE TO CONCUR WITH MOST OF MY MATHIS. COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT. THE FACT THAT THIS IS A SINGLE INDUSTRY IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME- YOU KNOW WE JUST DID IT BUT WE JUST THROUGH THE BUDGET WE RESTRICTED OTHER INDUSTRIES CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES- INDUSTRIES THAT WE ACTUALLY REALLY DO ARE RELYING ON TO PULL US OUT OF THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT WERE IN. A SOMEONE WITH COBIT I AM WHO ARE WHO TAG OF IT YOU KNOW THERE ARE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING THAT. THAT WE NEED TO LIFT OURSELVES OUT OF THIS AND THAT CONCERNS ME THAT WE ARE MAKING THIS VERY THINKS SINGULAR INDUSTRY. TO MR MAYES IS POINT. I AM ALSO CONCERNED I HAVE GRAVE ONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT NOT JUST WITH THIS BILL BUT THAT IN GENERAL THAT WE ARE SIGNING NEW TAXES AND ASSIGNING CREDITS THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS. WITHOUT A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT THE- REAL REPERCUSSIONS OF OUR ACTIONS ARE GOING TO BE AND THAT IS OF HUGE CONCERN TO. BUT WHENIT COMES TO JUST THE SPELLING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORKABILITY I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEFINITIONS BEYOND CLEAR I HOPE WE LANDED ON EARTH DID WE GET A COPY OF THE LETTER. YEAH I WAS JUST THERE WAS STANDING HERE WAS JUST DELIVERED TO ME SO I WAS GONNA HANG I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A OPPORTUNITY BEFORE I FINISH TO READ IT OUT LOUD TO EVERYBODY. OKAY IS THAT THE LETTER TO THE JOURNAL. ALL LEGISLATIVE INTENT INTENT YEAH WHY DON'T I LET YOU READ IT BEFORE IT CAN COME. OKAY I HAVEN'T READ IT MYSELF. WELL GIVE ME A MINUTE. S. H. ONE. WELCOME. OKAY YOU CAN READ IT PLEASE. HI THIS IS TO THE SECRETARY THE SENATE GERMANS CONTROLLERS THE PURPOSE OF THIS LETTER IS TO EXPRESS MY INTENT AND THEN ACTING SENATE BILL FIFTY ONE WHICH PROVIDES FOR AN ALTERNAIVE ELECTION FOR CERTAIN TAXPAYERS RECEIVING CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDITS AWARDS AND WHO COMMIT TO IRREVOCABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. IT IS% MY INTENT THAT IN PARAGRAPH. FIVE PARENTHESES CAPITAL A OF SUBDIVISION SMALL BE SECTION ONE SEVEN OH FIVE NINE POINT TWO AND IN PARAGRAPH FIVE A OF SUBDIVISION B. OF SECTION TWENTY THREE SIX EIGHTY NINE QUOTE UNQUOTE QUALIFY TAXPAYER MEANS A TAXPAYER THAT WILL PROSPECTIVELY AND CUMULATIVELY CREATE AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND PREVAILING WAGE FULL TIME OR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT NEW JOBS IN THE STATE. EACH YEAR OVER THE NUMBER OF JOBS EXISTING IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AWARD IT IS ALSO MY INTENT THAT IN PARAGRAPH FOUR OF SUBDIVISION BE. SECTION ONE SEVEN ZERO FIVE NINE POINT TWO. AND PARAGRAPH FOUR OF SUBDIVISION B. OF SECTION. TWENTY THREE SIX EIGHTY NINE CLINICAL IMMOBILE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY EQUIPMENT THAT WAS BUILT OR INSTALLED AS A CONDITION OF AN EARLIER CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT REQUIREMENTS. ALSO I CAN FIND THAT LEAVE THAT WITH YOU LATER SO DOCTOR CARD DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS COOL COOL COOL. YES THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PER YEAR FOR TEN YEARS IS WHAT THE BILLS WERE. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS WHAT APPLE DON'T MAKE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T QUITE I'M SORRY HE SAID WHAT HAPPENS I KNOW IT'S HARD TO HEAR THROUGH THAT ALL OF OUR MASKS AND THINGS- HE SAID WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T REACH THAT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS I FIVE THOUSAND JOBS NEW JOBS PER YEAR. WELL IN CALIFORNIA- CALIFORNIA COMPETES THEY HAVE. A SYSTEM OF ADDRESSING THAT AND I REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THEY DO HAVE A SYSTEM TO ADDRESS AND NOT GIVE THAT CREDIT OR PULL BACK ON THE CREDIT IS I REMEMBER ANYTHING CAL COMPETES IS USUALLY VERY I'M STRINGENT ON ON THEIR ON THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE CREDITS WHICH I DO GIVE HIM CREDIT. FOR SO YES THEY THEY USUALLY ARE ARE ARE GOOD ABOUT THAT. THAT BEING SAID THANK YOU FOR READING THE LETTER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT EVERYBODY HERE AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT THAT IT IS GOING TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS THAT ARE.

SO I DON'T THINK THIS PRECLUDES US NOR SHOULD IT HASN'T STOPPED US IN THE PAST NOW SHOULD STOP US IN THE FUTURE. FROM LOOKING. EIGHT AND WE HELP- OTHER INDUSTRIES SO I WAS JUST FOCUSED ON THIS ONE BUT AGAIN ON. YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THIS MEANS THAT WE DON'T ASSIST ANY OTHER INDUSTRY WE CAN'T SURVIVE AS A GREAT STATE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN- CENTER BRADFORD MAY BE WALKING IN WE WERE WAITING OUTSIDE AND HE HAD HE WAS RUNNING THE SHOW NEXT NEXT DOOR AND SO- HE WANTED TO CHECK IN ON IT SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAS FILED AN EMPLOYMENT KICK CLAIMS AND PROTECT. PROJECTIONS ARE THE JOB DISLOCATION SHOULD BE COULD BE LARGER THAN THAT EXPERIENCE STRICT DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC THE CALIFORNIA- ACTUALLY STARTED THE WRONG TYPE SORRY- SO LET ME START OVER AND SAY THANK YOU- THIS IS A CRITICAL MASS MEASURE THAT WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT% ASSISTANCE TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AS THEY STRUGGLE WITH THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CORBETT NINETEEN I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND MY APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH REVIEW OF THIS ISSUE PROVIDED TO THE IN IN IN IN THE ANALYSIS. AS YOU ARE AWARE THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC HAS HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED AFFECT ON CALIFORNIANS AND IT'S DEVASTATED THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF THE RESTAURANT AND HOSPITALITY INDUSTRIES WHICH PREDOMINATELY PREDOMINATELY EMPLOYEE LATINOS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR COLOR AS THE DATA HAS SHOWN. THESE ARE ALSO THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN THE MOST HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE CORONA VIRUS. AND DEBT IT IT IT F. ILLNESSES AND DEATHS ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES EMPLOYED BY SMALL BUSINESSES THEIR FATE IS CLOSELY TIED TO THE RESILIENCY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM. AND THE MASSIVE ECONOMIC DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC SENATE SINCE THE ONSET OF THE VIRUS AND THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER MY GOD THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED HISTORIC JOB LOSSES. WITH WITH WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH NEARLY HALF OF SMALL BUSINESSES TEMPORARILY CLOSED AND THEY REPORTED HAVING REDUCED THEIR ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT BY 40% THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT. DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED IN JUNE THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE PEAKED AT SIXTEEN POINT 3% SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PEAK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF TWELVE POINT 3% DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. WHILE RECENT NUMBERS HAVE SHOWN A MODEST IMPROVEMENT THERE IS NO TRUE AND INSIGHT. AB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN PROVIDES A DIRECT INCENTIVE TO SMALL BUSINESSES TO HIRE EMPLOYEES MANY OF WHOM HAVE WORKED AT THE SMALL BUSINESSES FOR YEARS. SB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN ALLOW SMALL BUSINESSES TO RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS BEGINS PERSONAL AND CORPORATE INCOME TAXES OR SALES AND USE TAXES FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEAR. FOR EACH NET NEW EMPLOYEE HIRED BY THAT BUSINESS SO LONG AS ALL OF THE FOLLOWING APPLIES THE SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYED ONE HUNDRED OR FEWER EMPLOYEES AS OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN. THE SMALL BUSINESS HAD A 50% DECREASE IN GROSS RECEIPTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY. THIS SMALL BUSINESS HAD A NET INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT BETWEEN JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THROUGH NOVEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE SMALL BUSINESS APPLIED FOR A TENTATIVE KERR CREDIT REGISTRATIONUNDER THIS BILL. BETWEEN DECEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY AND JANUARY FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. AT A TIME WHEN MANY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE DEBATING WHETHER THEY WILL EVER REOPEN OR BE ABLE TO COME BACK TO THE PRE COVERED STATE THEY NEED OUR SUPPORT MORE THAN EVER. I'M PROUD TO- BE HERE WITH SENATOR BRADFORD WHO OFTEN OBVIOUSLY IS NOT HERE RIGHT NOW- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. WELL IF SENATOR AFTER MAKES IT BACK WILL LET HIM. HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY I UNDERSTAND THERE IS ONE PRIMARY WHEN IT'S IN SUPPORT. OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES JAMIE CHAMBERLIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE APPEARING BY TELEPHONE WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT US MONITOR. MISTER. J. TRAVELING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY GREAT WELL GOOD AFTERNOON- THEY SHOULDN'T TAKE HIM ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON S. B. FOURTEEN FORTY SIX. SURE IF YOU WEEKS AGO GOVERNOR NEWSOM. ANNOUNCED HIS DESIRE TO CREATE A MAIN STREET HIRING CREDIT TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES. DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. LEAD MINISTRATIONS VERY PLEASED TO PARTNER WITH SENATOR BRADFORD CENTER COPYRIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SPONTANEOUS. BRING FOR THIS BILL TO CREATE A TAX CREDIT WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE CODE AND THEN. ADULT BURDENS AND BENEFITS PRIOR TO ME. REHIRING EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OFF THE RESEARCH I'VE DONE ON THE CLAIM. THIS PAST SPRING. I THINK THE REPUBLIC OKAY BECAUSE JOB DESCRIBING. OTHER OTHER CREDIT WILL CATCH ONE HIGHLIGHT. OF THE CREDIT SO FIRST IS THE PUBLIC SPEECHES THAT HOW THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR THOSE CREDITS ARE BASED OFF OF THE SAME PARAMETERS. A CALL FOR THE PROJECT ATTACK CREDIT FOR THE DROP ARE THE CARE. AND THE CALL CAME ARE THE BILL AFTER THAN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND THEY ALSO HAD TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT TO TALK DECLINE IN REVENUE- CONFORMING TO THE SEVERAL PARAMETERS FOR THE PAYROLL TAX REVENUE MAKE IT EASIER FOR BUSINESSES. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY QUALIFY FOR THE HIRING CREDIT. THE SECOND SECOND POINT IS THAT- THIS WILL TAKE THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES ACTUALLY USE THE CREDIT- AS THE ELDEST TYPICAL THE CREDIT IS ALLOWED AGAINST. INCOME TAX AND CORPORATE TAX BUT BECAUSE MANY BUSINESSES WILL NOT HAVE TAXABLE INCOME- IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ALSO. IS CREDITED LOCAL LAWS. ARE TO BE THEMSELVES. THAT IS A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THE CREDIT ON BOTH. THE SALES TAX BY THE- NET INCOME TAX. FINALLY THIS IS A VERY GOOD ESTIMATES WHAT THE WHAT THE COST OF THIS CREDIT WILL BE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE HAD REAL GOOD DATA ON HOW MANY BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO MEET. THE CRITERIA FOR THE CREDIT THEREFORE THE CREDIT IS CAPTAIN ALLOCATED TO REPEAT THE FISCAL FISCAL UNCERTAINTY FOR THE STATE. LOCAL CREDIT IS GOING TO TRY. A MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT TO BOTH SMALL BUSINESSES AND TO AVOID COULD NOT HARM. A BUDGET MONTH DECLINE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE PANDEMIC- THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS- THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. HERE A IT'S MODERATE WOULD PLEASE OPEN UP THE MAINLINE TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT TESTIMONY. HUTTERITE ARE IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. ARE YOU STILL THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. CHANNEL ONE ISN'T SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. HELLO. WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE NOW OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME ONE ZERO IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR NO ONE HAS QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU ISTHERE ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION BE A REMOTE VOTING STATION AT THIS TIME. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. THING NINE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DR KIRK. ALL YEP. WELL WHEN. ALL DR KIRK I DON'T YOU'RE MIKE IS ON THIS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. BUT SHE GOOD IN TERMS PROJECTIONS IS VERY SHE'S GOING TO SO MY CONCERN IS THAT THE- THESE CREDITS BY LARGE DON'T CREATE NEW JOBS. ON THE OTHER HAND IS BUSINESSES DO DESERVE- BREAK DURING THIS THE REQUESTED I HAVE THEM WHAT THEY POINT OUT HERE IS FIRST HOME MOST OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE THAT IN MY DISTRICT HAVE FAR LESS THAN A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. THOSE THAT DO HAVE A HUNDRED ARE LARGER MORE SOPHISTICATED AND THE CONCERN HERE IS THAT IT WOULD BE THESE. THAT THE MOM AND POP BUSINESSES WOULDN'T BE SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO REALLY APPLY FOR THIS IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE BUILD THAT SORT OF- WOULD BE ABLE TO EDUCATE CONSOLIDATIONS- TO APPLY FOR THE BILL. FOR EXCUSE ME APPLY FOR THE CREDIT. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE- IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT WE EXPECT THAT WE- THAT THAT THERE IS SUCH A NEED FOR RESOURCES FOR BUSINESSES THAT. THAT SENDING THE INFORMATION TO THE OUR LOCAL- SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS- WILL HELP TO GET THE WORD OUT AND- AND WE HAVE TO RELY ON THEM IT'S A ONE YEAR PROGRAM AND THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO GET IS TO GET. BUSINESS BUSINESS IS UP AND RUNNING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND SO- WELL WE'LL HAVE TO RELY ON OUR LOCAL SBDC STIFF TO BE ABLE TO PUSH OUT THE INFORMATION. OKAY THANKS. MISTER MATHIS OKAY TEACHING YEAH BUT I MEAN THE FIRST. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- CENTER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN ASKING- TO SEE SOME LEGISLATION LIKE THIS TO SEE THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES GET HELP- WE DO A LOT OF WORK- BACK IN MY DISTRICT WITH KOBE IS WITH OUR CHAMBERS ON MAKING SURE THAT THESE BUSINESSES ARE AWARE OF THESE PROGRAMS- SO HELP ANSWER MISTER COURSE QUESTION I DEFINITELY REACH OUT. ONTO YOUR CHAMBERS AND STUFF AND LET THEM NOW. AS AS REPUBLICAN IT'S GOOD TO SEE THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY LISTEN- SAW WITH THAT ALL MOTION TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. IF WE CAN GET A SECOND. THANK YOU SIR. WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. MATHIS THE MOTION BY MATHIS AND SECOND BY PETRIE-NORRIS AND THEN THE SUMMER KILEY DID YOU HAVE A- AND SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS I THINK THAT THIS TAX CUT IS FINE AND MAYBE IT'LL HELP SOME SMALL BUSINESSES ON THE MARGIN BUT- I THINK IT'S SORT OF A SAD COMMENTARY ON- THE WORK PRODUCT OF THE LEGISLATURE HER THESE LAST FEW MONTHS. THIS IS KIND OF WHAT WE'VE LANDED ON IS THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO HELP OUT. SMALL BUSINESSES A THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CREDIT I MEAN THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE WORTH A LOT MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS IF WE SIMPLY STOP DOING THEM. IN FACT THERE ARE NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING DOING THEY'RE GONNA BE ON THE FLOOR TONIGHT- THAT'LL COST THEM A LOT MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS- SO- AGAIN I'LL ALSO PUT THE BILL- BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT. FOLKS WHO ARE ALSO SUPPORTING IT WOULD- AT THE REASONS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THIS FIELD- THOSE WILL BE BORNE IN MIND AS WE CONSIDER- OTHER LEGISLATION- TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIVING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL. I SURE. CRITICISM MAYBE NOT THE EXACT SAME CRITICISM THAT THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE BILL AND I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT AND IN INTO MEDIUM GOING TO VOTE NO. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME BEFORE IT GETS BEFORE ME ON THE FLOOR BUT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE THINKING ABOUT IT. IT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT. YOU KNOW THIS IS A MORE OF A PRODUCT. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THEN IT IS A OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT SEEMS THAT IT'S- GOT A GREAT. KIND OF A- A CAMPAIGN HE KICK TO IT. WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC RECESSION AND LOOK AT ALL THE JOBS. THAT WE'RE CREATING. AS WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THIS BUT IT'S CHERRY PICKING. BECAUSE THESE ARE BUSINESSES THAT ARE ACTUALLY. KIND OF ON THE ON THE GLIDE PATH UP. OUT OF THE PANDEMIC RECESSION AS WERE OPENING UP THE ECONOMY. AND WE'RE EASING THAT GLIDE PATH UP WE'RE PUTTING MORE WIND- IT BUT BENEATH THEM. AND IN FACT WERE. HELPING THEM HIRE EMPLOYEES WHEN. THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. WOULD PROBABLY NECESSITATE HIRING EMPLOYEES BECAUSE BUSINESS IS RETURNING TO THEM AND I AM HAPPY FOR THEM. I AM SO. AMAZINGLY HAPPY FOR THEM. THAT HE ARE ABLE TO HIRE PEOPLE AGAIN. THAT THEY CAN MAKE MONEY THAT THEY CAN PAY THEIR RENT. THEY CAN PAY MORTGAGES THEY CAN PAY LOANS- THAT BUSINESS IS RETURNING. AND IT'S NICE TO THINK THAT WE COULD REWARD THEM FOR IT. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS JUST COMPLETELY SHREDDED. THAT ARE NOT GETTING HELP. THROUGH THIS AND SO I'M REALLY STRUGGLING. WITH THE CONCEPT HERE WHERE WE ARE WE ARE REALLY TAKING SOME EASY WINS. WITH A TAX CREDIT SO THAT WE CAN CLAIM THAT WE'VE CREATED MORE JOBS THROUGH OUR LEGISLATION. WHEN IN FACT THESE ARE JOBS THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE CREATED BY GROWING ECONOMY ANYWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT IF THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE BUT- I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON. WHAT YOU'RE DISTRICT LOOKS LIKE- I HAVE I HAPPEN TO HAVE A VERY MUCH LIKE ASSEMBLY. MEMBER CORK SAID- MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESSES IN MY IN MY DISTRICT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES AND NOT A LARGE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE OWNED. BY IMMIGRANTS- PEOPLE THAT ARRIVED HERE WITH NOTHING AND HAVE BEEN WORKING THEIR ENTIRE LIFE TO BE ABLE TO. TO PROVIDES A LOT OF THEM FOOD- THERE ISN'T THERE ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT ARE THAT ARE GROWING STUFF. AND THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A TAX CREDIT THAT'S THAT'S THERE THAT'LL HELP HIM YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S CREDIT THAT'S GOING TO. PUT SOME AIR UNDER THE WINGS BUT RIGHT NOW- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS ANY ERROR UNDER ANY BUSINESSES WINGS IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- THE MINUTE THAT PEOPLE START. WORKING FULL TIME OR- OR THEY CAN HIRE MORE PEOPLE TO COME AND DO THE WORK- THE BETTER THE ECONOMY'S GOING TO BE AND THAT REALLY HELPS THE LOCAL ECONOMY FOR PEOPLE HAVE CASH TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE RENT TO BUY GROCERIES AND DO. TO THE NECESSITY FOR THE NECESSITY NECESSITY SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR POSITION BUT- AND COULD WE HAVE DONE MORE ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I WILL TELL YOU THAT I AM VOTING RIGHT NOW ON BILLS. THAT I WISH WE HAD DONE MORE. BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND SO WE DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I DO APPRECIATE IT.
