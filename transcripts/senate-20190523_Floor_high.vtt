COURTS.

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:25.591
I'M CONCERNED THAT THE MEDICAL

TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE HAVE

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.002
SOME VERY COMPLEX CASES THAT

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.471
REQUIRE PSYCHIATRIC INTERVENTION.

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:42.774
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD

00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:43.075
[inaudible]

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:44.376
QUESTION.

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:45.377

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:45.677
[inaudible]

THAT.

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:51.883
WITH THEIR YEARS OF KNOWLEDGE

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.986
FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL --

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:55.721
MANY YEARS OF GOING INTO

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:57.322
PSYCHIATRY.

00:20:57.389 --> 00:21:01.226
AND AND STARTING A VERY NARROW --

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:02.995
GROUP OF THE DRUGS UNDERSTANDING

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:05.163

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:08.233
APPLICATION [inaudible]

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.336

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:13.105
LATE TREATMENT TO KIDS ARE

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:15.574

CERTAINLY ON ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:22.381

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:44.636
THE DOOR TO THAT HAPPENING AND

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:47.339

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:02.940

PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:02.839
THEM IN THEIR POSSESSION.

00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:04.441
IT IS IN THE SPIRIT OF NOT ONE

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:07.377
MORE THAT I BRING FORWARD TODAY

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:09.012

TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE.

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:15.619
CREATED A CENTER. FOR RESEARCH

00:54:15.685 --> 00:54:18.922
INTO FIREARM RELATED VIOLENCE.

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:19.856
THIS WAS DONE AT THE UNIVERSITY

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.791
OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS AND IT

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:23.526
WAS A BILL THAT WAS BROUGHT BY

AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:30.533
WE HAVE SEEN EXTRAORDINARY

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.701
RESEARCH DONE TO TRY TO

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:33.436
UNDERSTAND.

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:36.206
MORE ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE WHO

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:38.341
COMMITTED WHY WHAT CAN WE DO TO

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:40.176
PREVENT IT WHAT CAN WE DO TO

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:42.312
DISTRACT PEOPLE WHO WOULD

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:43.813
OTHERWISE USE GUNS.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.582
AS A WAY TO EITHER RESOLVE HEIR

AND EVEN DEATH [inaudible] TO

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:54.791
OTHERS.

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:57.027
DRAWING ON THAT RESEARCH PUBLIC

00:54:57.093 --> 00:54:58.461
RESEARCH EXCUSE ME PUBLISHED

00:54:58.528 --> 00:55:00.897
RESEARCH FINDINGS.

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:03.566
SHOW A STRONG CORRELATION.

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:05.402
BETWEEN CERTAIN ALCOHOL AND DRUG

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.771
RELATED CONVICTIONS AND FUTURE

00:55:07.837 --> 00:55:09.406
GUN VIOLENCE.

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:11.675
THIS HERE TODAY IS A BILL BASED

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:14.544
UPON DATA BASED UPON SCIENCE

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:16.279
BASED UPON UNCONTROVERTED

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:18.081
RESEARCH [inaudible]

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:19.849
THIS MEASURE.

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:22.585
IDENTIFIES THAT ALCOHOL AND DRUG

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.020
RELATED CONVICTIONS.

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:26.256
CREATE A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT

00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:29.259
THOSE VERY PEOPLE WILL USE FIRE

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:31.695
ARMS IN FUTURE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR

00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:35.198
IN FACT OUR UP TO FIVE TIMES.

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:38.668
LIKELIER TO USE A FIREARM.

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:40.303
THEN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:42.906
EXPERIENCED THOSE CONVICTIONS

00:55:42.972 --> 00:55:44.240
THIS MEASURE WILL PROHIBIT

00:55:44.307 --> 00:55:46.609
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO ABUSE

00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:49.813
FIREARMS FROM POSSESSING THEM.

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.481
THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT THERE

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:54.417
HAVE BEEN THREE D. WIDE DRIVING

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:56.152

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:01.024
BRING ABOUT THIS PROHIBITION.

00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:03.326
OTHER CRIMES IN THE BILL INCLUDE

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:04.694

00:56:09.966 --> 00:56:11.568
WOULD REQUIRE ONLY TWO

CONVICTIONS WITHIN A THREE YEAR

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:15.205
PERIOD WHY BECAUSE THE RESEARCH

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.974
IN THE DATA SHOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.276
FIVE TIMES LIKELIER. TO ENGAGE

00:56:20.343 --> 00:56:22.112
IN FUTURE CRIMINAL CONDUCT AND

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:25.548
WITH A FIREARM THAT IS THE DATA

00:56:25.615 --> 00:56:27.150
THAT IS THE SCIENCE.

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:28.451
NO THIS BILL IS SUBSTANTIALLY

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:30.887
SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT SENATOR

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:31.821
WALL BROCK.

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:33.623

00:56:41.097 --> 00:56:43.299
WE HAVE THE DATA WE HAVE THE

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:45.802
SCIENCE IT IS CLEAR WE CAN DO

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:46.936
SOMETHING TO PREVENT THIS

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:49.639
VIOLENCE AND WHILE WE MAY NOT BE

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:50.373
ABLE TO MEET.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.976
THE WHOLE OF NOT ONE MORE WE CAN

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:56.813
PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.781
REDUCE.

00:56:57.847 --> 00:57:00.483
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.786
RELATED FATALITIES GOING FORWARD

00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:04.454
AND WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:06.456
ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:07.991

I'M STRUCK BY THE IRONY.

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.802
THE GREAT MOVE IN CALIFORNIA NOW

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:20.436
IS TO DECLARE.

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:22.272
CRIMINALIZE DRUGS.

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:24.641

WERE DUPED.

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:42.125
INTO THAT MEASURE.

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:45.929
THIS IS A HARD PULL WEIGHT. TO

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:50.333
DISARM MORE CALIFORNIANS.

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.769
NOW THERE ARE CERTAIN DRUGS THAT

00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:54.838
ARE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS.

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:56.739
I DON'T HEAR THAT TALKED ABOUT

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:58.675
MUCH AROUND HERE METHAMPHETAMINE.

00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:01.878
THAT'S THE MEAN DRUG.

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:02.812
THE WOMAN WHO TAKES

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:04.614
METHAMPHETAMINE IS A ONE WOULD

00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:06.516

METHAMPHETAMINE.

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.989
DOES THAT ABSOLUTELY MEAN THEN

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:15.258
WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER.

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.526
A WEAPON.

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:18.761
WELL THAT MAKES ALL KINDS OF

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:20.129

DRUG OFFENDERS OF WHICH THERE

00:58:28.137 --> 00:58:32.542
ARE FEWER NOW ANYWAY. TO ASSUME

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:34.377
THAT THEY THEN SHOULD HAVE A TEN

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.446
YEAR.

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:39.816
MORATORIUM ON HAVING A FIREARM

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:42.952
NOW.

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:43.553
THEY'VE DONE NOTHING RIGHT NOW

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.955
BUT THE DRUGS.

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:48.825
HOWEVER IN LEGISLATION.

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:52.228
THAT HAS PASSED.

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:53.963
WE ARE FORGIVING.

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.865
INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY USED A

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:58.468
GUN.

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.603
FROM HAVING AN ENHANCED SENTENCE.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:02.772

REPEAL THAT BILL AT WELL ARE YOU

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:06.476
THINK IT'S NOT ALWAYS THROUGH

00:59:06.542 --> 00:59:09.012
YET BUT THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD

00:59:09.078 --> 00:59:11.080
BE GOING NOT.

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:14.317
MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE.

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:16.653
IF YOU USE A GUN THEN.

00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:20.123

ANYMORE ENHANCEMENTS.

00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:28.364
ENHANCEMENTS FOR THE USE OF A

FIREARM USE A GUN G TO PRISON

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.367
WAS VOTED ON TO THE PEOPLE OF

00:59:31.434 --> 00:59:33.736
CALIFORNIA.

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:35.471
I GUESS THEY WERE SMART ENOUGH

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:37.440
TO FIGURE OUT.

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:38.474
THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE FOR USING

00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:40.843
A GUN.

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:44.280
LET'S ADDRESS THE INDIVIDUAL.

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.848
AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:49.686
INDIVIDUAL'S BEHAVIOR OR MAKE A

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:51.587
PRESUMPTION [inaudible]

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:52.889
THE DRUGS.

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:55.491
HAVE A GUN [inaudible]

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.093
THE DANGERS.

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.028
I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT BUT I

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.430
DON'T AGREE WITH THE PERVERSE

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.365
LOGIC.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.667
THIS IS SIMPLY ANOTHER WAY. TO

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:07.370
DISARM.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:10.907
CALIFORNIANS I REGION OVER.

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:14.544
THE KEYS SENATOR STONE.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THE

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.815
AND COLLEAGUES YOU DON'T.

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:20.817
WE AGREE ON PROBABLY 90% OF THE

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:22.452
ISSUES THAT HIT THE FLOOR WE USE

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.187
OUR UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO A LOT

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:25.688
TEN THERE ARE.

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:27.256
A FEW ISSUES.

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:28.992
A FEW ISSUES THAT.

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:30.893
THAT DIVIDE US [inaudible]

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.163
AND WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL I

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.432
THINK THAT WE WE DON'T BE

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:39.535
HYPOCRITICAL -- AS WE DISCUSS

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:42.839
THESE VERY SENSITIVE ISSUES.

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.108
OF COURSE I I RISE IN OPPOSITION

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:48.845
TO SB.

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:49.479
FIFTY FIVE AND I WANT TO MAKE IT

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:51.180
CLEAR THAT.

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:52.515
I THINK I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:53.816
REPUBLICANS IN THIS COUNTRY

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.151
INCLUDING THE STATE OF

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:58.354
CALIFORNIA THAT WE DEPLORE.

01:00:58.421 --> 01:00:59.956
THE VIOLENCE THAT WE SEE BEING

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.224
USE WITH GUNS ESPECIALLY IN OUR

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:03.893
SCHOOLS [inaudible]

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.297
AND IT'S A SYMPTOM OF OUR LACK

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:11.234
OF PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.403
SERVICES.

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:15.171
TO OUR YOUNGSTERS IT FIND

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.939
THEMSELVES MORNING NEED A MENTAL

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.674
HEALTH SERVICES AND I WOULD.

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:20.843
SAY THAT A BIG FACTOR IN THAT

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:21.911
REQUIREMENT IS BECAUSE OF SOCIAL

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:24.547
MEDIA [inaudible]

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:26.716
SO.

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:28.885
THIS BILL WILL PLACE A TEN YEAR.

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.820
FIRE ARM PROHIBITION ON

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:34.157
INDIVIDUALS AND NON VIOLENT DRUG.

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:36.426
OR SUBSTANCE USE BEHAVIOR.

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:39.862
USING A MISDEMEANOR.

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:43.099
I FIND IT VERY IRONIC.

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:46.035
THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CAUSE OF

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.471
DEATH IN PEOPLE THAT USE OPIATES.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.606
IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.075
IT'S UP AND DOWN MAKE WE'VE LOST

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:54.410
MORE PEOPLE TO OVERDOSES OF

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:55.945
NARCOTICS THEN WE LOST IN THE

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:57.914
VIETNAM WAR.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.950
AND A BIG CULPRIT.

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:03.086
IN THESE DEATHS [inaudible]

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:04.921
IS.

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:07.056

NOT ALLOWING BILLS TO MOVE

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:21.003
FORWARD.

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.573
THAT DON'T GO AFTER THE USER

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:28.644
LIKE TO SEE BUT TO GO AFTER THE

01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:31.647
DISTRIBUTORS OF THESE POISONS.

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:34.050
BETTER MARKETING THESE POISONS

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:36.085
AS THOUGH THEY ARE.

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:38.754
ANOTHER NARCOTIC AS AN EXAMPLE

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.957
FENTANYL. FIFTY TIMES STRONGER

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:43.126

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:44.760
BUT BE MARKETED AS HEROIN.

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.696

INJECTING HEROIN.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.003
THEY ARE DYING OF RESPIRATORY

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.171
DEPRESSION WHILE THE NEEDLE IS

01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:56.639
IN THEIR ARMEN STILL PUMPING THE

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.107
PLUNGER OF THAT POISON INTO

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.676
THEIR VEINS.

SOME TEETH INTO THE LAWS TO STOP

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:12.388
THE THE NEEDLESS LOSS OF LIFE OF

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.423
THOUSANDS.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.594
NOT A FEW BUT THOUSANDS OF LIVES.

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:19.762
THIS LEGISLATOR WON'T EVEN LET

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.998

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:55.665
RIGHTS.

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:57.700
THE COURTS HAVE TO INTERVENE AND

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:58.834
FIVE OPINED THAT THIS WILL

01:03:58.901 --> 01:03:59.835
PROBABLY GET OFF THE FLORIDA

MONEY ON DEFENDING THE PORTAL

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.677
LAW AND ULTIMATELY THE GUN

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:08.711
RIGHTS GROUPS ARE GOING TO SHOW

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:13.316
THAT -- IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:13.616
[inaudible]

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.318
SO.

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:18.888
IF YOU HAVE A MINOR MISDEMEANOR.

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:20.856
INVOLVING SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

HE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET A

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:23.459
FIREARM FOR TEN YEARS BUT THIS

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.594
IS CRAZY.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.195
BUT IF YOU'RE TWENTY FOUR YEARS

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:27.597
OLD AND YOU RAPE A TEENAGER

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:28.864

FIVE YEARS OLD.

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:34.570
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE.

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:35.938
I'M SORRY BUT THIS JUST DOESN'T

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.840
SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ME IF

YOU'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:41.510
SO CALLED MASS INCARCERATION AND

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:43.312
THE LESS DESIRE TO EMPTY OUR

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:44.380
PRISONS AND MAKING OUR OUR

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:46.315
COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE WHICH IS

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:47.984
ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.252
ARE WE NOT GOING TO BE TO

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:50.519
PASSING BILLS A DEPRIVE

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:51.754
INDIVIDUALS OF THE RIGHT SIMPLY

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:52.955
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HIGHER

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:56.225
STATISTICAL PROBABILITY.

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:57.893
THAT THEY MAY ENGAGE IN VIOLENT

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:01.564
GUN RELATED CRIMES.

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:02.498
YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD OFTEN ON THE

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:05.735
FLOOR THE SENATE THAT.

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.169
YOUNG PEOPLE'S BRAINS DON'T

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:10.339

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:11.707
FIVE YEARS OLD.

I THINK MANY OF YOU.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.077
I'VE EVEN MENTIONED ON THE FLOOR

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:17.213
THE SENATE WELL.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:17.780
IF THEY DON'T HAVE A MATURE

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.582
BRAIN OF WHY ARE WE TRYING TO

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:22.084
LET SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS VOTE.

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:23.386
I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT CONCEPT

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:23.686
[inaudible]

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.856
HOUSES FAIR.

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:28.424
HOW DOES THIS BILL EVEN MAKES

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:29.625
SENSE AND SHORT?

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:30.826
PASSING LAWS TO TAKE AWAY THE

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:32.328
RIGHTS OR IMPOSE PUNISHMENTS

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:34.263
BASED ON INDIVIDUALS HIGHER

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:36.565
STATISTICAL PROBABILITY.

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:39.001
IS NOT A PATH.

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:40.169
BUT LAWMAKERS SHOULD BE MAKING

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:42.038
IN THE STATE.

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.807
THIS IS A BAD BILL.

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:47.043
THIS IS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:48.411
BILL IF IT BECOMES LAW AND FOR

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:50.246
THOSE REASONS.

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:51.747

YOU TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.461
OBJECTION OF COURSE.

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.263

IT IS AT NEW INFORMATION FOR ME

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:17.106
AND AND AND ANY TIME WE CAN USE

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:19.041
GOOD SCIENCE TO ADVANCE GOOD

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:20.976
POLICIES ON THEIR ONE OF THE

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:22.411
ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED BY PAR

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.080
ACT WAS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.514
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:26.615
BACKLOG.

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:30.386

CAN AND CANNOT OWN WEAPONS NO

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:34.523
IT'S WONDER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:37.493
THAT THAT BE HAPPY -- TO THERE

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.261
WAS A CONCERN THAT THIS IS GOING

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.930
TO BURDEN THE COURTS AND OTHERS

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:42.431
WITH HAVING TO GO BACK AND

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:44.333
IDENTIFY HOW MANY DO YOU AYE

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.935
SOMEONE'S HAD.

01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:48.237
SO THE BILL ACTUALLY -- AS IT'S

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:50.639
PRESENTLY CONSTITUTED IDENTIFIES

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:53.309
THAT IT IS ONLY A FUTURE DO YOU

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.111
WHY SOMEONE OTHER WORDS IF YOU

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:56.545
HAVE TO DRUNK DRIVING

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:58.114
CONVICTIONS IN THESE OUR

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.516
CONVICTIONS -- WITHIN THE PAST

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:03.085
TEN YEARS AND YOU GET A THIRD

ARREST AND CONVICTION SUBSEQUENT

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.022
TO THAT SO IF THIS BILL BECOMES

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:08.824
EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST.

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.529
CONVICTION IN.

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:15.765
MAY AND THE COURT THEN WE'LL

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.700
LOOK BACK EACH RAP SHEET BECAUSE

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:19.068
THAT TAKES ABOUT TEN SECONDS.

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:21.337
AND IF THEY SEE THAT YOU'VE HAD

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.739
TWO PRIOR DO YOU Y. CONVICTIONS

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:25.374
AND NOW A THIRD CONVICTION.

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:26.709
THAT INFORMATION WILL THEN GO

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:28.477
IMMEDIATELY TO THE ATTORNEY

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:30.746
GENERAL'S OFFICE TO BE PLACED ON

THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST IT

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:33.949
SHOULD TAKE A TOTAL OF MAYBE

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:34.817
FIVE MINUTES.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.685
AND HOPEFULLY OF COURSE THERE IS

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:40.423
MORE MONEY BEING -- GIVEN A TO

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.591
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN ORDER TO

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:43.959
ADDRESS THE PROHIBITED PERSONS

01:07:44.026 --> 01:07:45.661
AS THE GREAT IRONY THERE BY THE

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:46.762
WAY.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.964
IS THAT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:51.700
STARTED BUYING GUNS WE GOT.

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:54.003
WE GOT BEHIND IN PUTTING PEOPLE

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:55.638
ON THAT LIST WE ARE PUTTING MORE

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:58.207
MONEY INTO CORRECTING THAT A

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.376
PROBLEM AND AGAIN IF WE CAN SAVE

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:01.310
THE LIVES.

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:03.679
OF YOUNG PEOPLE OR ANY INNOCENT

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:04.847
PERSON.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:05.714
WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:07.650
VICTIM OF SOMEONE WHO WAS KNOWN

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:10.152
TO BE FIVE TIMES LIKELIER TO USE

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.821
A FIREARM IN THE FUTURE?

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:14.290
THEN IT IS WORTH THAT COST SO --

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:16.892
I APPRECIATE IN YOUR OF

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:18.794
RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THE

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:20.663
SCIENCE IS THERE SOMETIMES IN

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.064
THIS WORLD WE REALLY NEED TO

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:24.200
FOLLOW THE SCIENCE IN FACT WE

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:25.601
SHOULD BE FOLLOWING SCIENCE

01:08:25.668 --> 01:08:31.207
THAT'S WHY THIS -- ENTITY WAS

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:31.740
CREATED WHY THIS RESEARCH

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:32.908
INSTITUTE WAS CREATED THAT'S WHY

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.044
THIS BILL IS -- FOCUSED ON THE

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:37.713
SPECIFIC SIGNS UP RATHER THAN

HERE IS THE SCIENCE.

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:52.387
THE SCIENCE THAT SHOWS THAT

OF ALCOHOL LEADING TO CONVICTION

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:06.935
WHICH THE SCIENCE SHOWS.

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:10.572

NOT AN ATTORNEY -- THIS FLOOR IS

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:29.224
CLEARLY CONSTITUTIONAL IN FACT

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.159

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.769
ADDICTION TO A NARCOTIC DRUG

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:43.338
ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF A FIREARM

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:45.307
ASSAULT WITH A FIREARM IF YOU

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:53.982
NOTION THAT IT'S

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:55.550
UNCONSTITUTIONAL IS JUST.

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:56.919
NOT ACCURATE.

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:58.887

SOMETHING TO PREVENT.

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:07.362
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:09.998

THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD.

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.570
BUT IF WE CAN PREVENT THIS FROM

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.773
HAPPENING THEN WE WILL HAVE DONE

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.341

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:03.438
HIGHWAY SYSTEM -- THAT ARE USED

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:06.541
AS LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS --

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:07.509
THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT WHAT WE

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:08.977
WOULD CONSIDER CLASSICS STATE

FEDERAL ACTION IN FACT.

02:41:41.191 --> 02:41:43.360
IN MY VIEW A DERELICTION OF DUTY

02:41:43.427 --> 02:41:45.562
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO

ABOUT SUBSIDIZING THEIR BOTTOM

02:41:51.501 --> 02:41:52.369
LINE.

02:41:52.436 --> 02:41:53.937
WE GIVE A LOT OF MONEY TO THE

02:41:54.004 --> 02:41:57.941

02:42:01.611 --> 02:42:03.113
COMPELLED TO RAISE THAT ISSUE

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:04.915
BECAUSE THERE IS A FARM BILL

02:42:04.981 --> 02:42:06.283
MOVING THROUGH CONGRESS.

02:42:06.349 --> 02:42:07.384
THERE ARE PLENTY OF RESOURCES

02:42:07.451 --> 02:42:09.052
FEDERALLY THAT WE'VE ALREADY

02:42:09.119 --> 02:42:10.353
GIVEN THEM FROM OUR TAX DOLLARS.

02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:13.457

03:06:33.749 --> 03:06:36.118
MANY OF YOU PRIVATELY ASKED ME

03:06:36.184 --> 03:06:37.786
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS AGAIN.

03:06:44.960 --> 03:06:46.929
EPIDEMIC IS HYPERBOLE.

03:06:46.995 --> 03:06:49.197
I USE THE WORD EPIDEMIC AS USED

03:06:49.264 --> 03:06:51.900
BY PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTISTS.

03:06:51.967 --> 03:06:53.969
THERE IS A NATIONAL.

03:06:54.036 --> 03:06:54.970
EPIDEMIC.

03:06:59.107 --> 03:07:00.676
SO WHY IS THAT LINK TO SUGAR

03:07:00.742 --> 03:07:02.077
SWEETENED BEVERAGES.

03:07:02.144 --> 03:07:03.278
BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE

SINGLE LEADING SOURCE

03:07:06.448 --> 03:07:06.682

03:07:10.452 --> 03:07:12.821
PROMOTED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND

03:07:12.888 --> 03:07:16.325

03:07:24.533 --> 03:07:26.902
THE MARKETING OF THESE PRODUCTS.

03:07:26.969 --> 03:07:29.538
IT BECOMES A STAPLE IN THE DIET.

03:07:29.605 --> 03:07:32.107
NOT A WEEKEND TO TREAT

03:07:32.174 --> 03:07:32.407

IS PROVEN IN MEDICAL ARTICLES

03:07:43.385 --> 03:07:45.988
FROM UC SAN FRANCISCO.

03:07:46.054 --> 03:07:47.956
ON THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL

THE SCIENCE IS AN CONSERVE

03:07:52.628 --> 03:07:54.162
CONTROVERSIAL.

03:07:54.229 --> 03:07:56.331
NOW SOME OF THE OPPONENTS SAY.

03:07:56.398 --> 03:07:57.599
WELL THERE'S DATA THAT SHOWS A

03:07:57.666 --> 03:07:59.534
DECREASE IN THE CONSUMPTION OF

03:07:59.601 --> 03:08:00.969
SODAS.

03:08:01.036 --> 03:08:02.671
BUT A CONTINUED INCREASE IN

03:08:02.738 --> 03:08:04.606
PREVENTABLE DIABETES.

03:08:04.673 --> 03:08:07.342
THEIR THEIR PART RIGHT.

03:08:07.409 --> 03:08:09.945
THE DECREASE IN SODA CONSUMPTION

03:08:10.012 --> 03:08:12.714
IS BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS THAT

03:08:12.781 --> 03:08:14.149
HAVE BEEN CAMOUFLAGED.

03:08:14.216 --> 03:08:16.385
IS HELPFUL DRINKS FORTIES

03:08:16.451 --> 03:08:18.487
ANARCHY DRINKS THAT ARE BEING

03:08:18.553 --> 03:08:20.188
PUSHED IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH

03:08:20.255 --> 03:08:22.724
EQUAL AMOUNTS OR MORE SUGAR.

03:08:22.791 --> 03:08:25.327
THAT WOULD ALSO HAVE THE WARNING

03:08:25.394 --> 03:08:26.261
LABEL.

03:08:26.328 --> 03:08:29.965
LET ME JUST MENTION SOME OF THE

03:08:30.032 --> 03:08:32.167
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN.

03:08:32.234 --> 03:08:33.502
COMING OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS

03:08:33.568 --> 03:08:35.470
THAT I THINK HELP STREAMLINE THE

03:08:35.537 --> 03:08:37.806
BILL IN EASE SOME OF THE

03:08:37.873 --> 03:08:39.775
CONCERNS OF BURDENS AT THE

03:08:39.841 --> 03:08:41.009
RETAIL LEVEL.

03:08:41.076 --> 03:08:43.979
AS AMENDED THE BILL EXEMPTS MILK

03:08:44.046 --> 03:08:46.481
PRODUCTS -- AND WE'VE SEEN THE

03:08:46.548 --> 03:08:48.283
REMOVAL OF OPPOSITION FROM THE

03:08:48.350 --> 03:08:50.686
AG INDUSTRY THE DAIRY INDUSTRY

03:08:50.752 --> 03:08:52.020
THE ALMOND INDUSTRY.

03:08:52.087 --> 03:08:53.555
WE'VE ALSO MADE IT EASIER FOR

03:08:53.622 --> 03:08:55.290
POSTING THE LABEL ON VENDING

03:08:55.357 --> 03:08:58.193
MACHINES TO ONLY HAVE TO OCCUR

03:08:58.260 --> 03:08:59.861
AT THE TIME THE CONTRACT ON THAT

03:08:59.928 --> 03:09:02.330
VENDING MACHINE IS RENEWED OR

03:09:02.397 --> 03:09:04.299
THE VENDING MACHINE IS SWITCHED

03:09:04.366 --> 03:09:05.233
OUT.

03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:07.636
AND AT THE RESTAURANT LEVEL WE

03:09:07.703 --> 03:09:09.237
REQUIRE SINGLE POSTING.

03:09:09.304 --> 03:09:11.173
THE REAL FOCUS WOULD BE ON THE

03:09:11.239 --> 03:09:13.341
BEVERAGE CONTAINER THE TWO LITER

03:09:13.408 --> 03:09:16.611
BOTTLE IT IS BEING SOLD LESS.

03:09:16.678 --> 03:09:17.946
FOR AN AMOUNT LESS THAN AN

03:09:18.013 --> 03:09:19.514
EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF MILK OR

03:09:19.581 --> 03:09:21.783
WATER.

03:09:21.850 --> 03:09:24.119
FRIENDS THIS IS NOT THE

03:09:24.186 --> 03:09:26.755
INVENTION OF POLITICIANS.

03:09:26.822 --> 03:09:29.157
THIS IS THE REALITY CONFIRMED BY

03:09:29.224 --> 03:09:30.826
DOCTORS AND PUBLIC HEALTH

03:09:30.892 --> 03:09:32.661
ADVOCATES THAT'S WHY THERE'S

03:09:32.728 --> 03:09:34.196
SUCH A STRONG COALITION OF

03:09:34.262 --> 03:09:36.264
PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES FROM

03:09:36.331 --> 03:09:38.633

THE PTA.

03:09:43.271 --> 03:09:46.108
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON IS THIS

03:09:46.174 --> 03:09:46.708
VAST SOLUTION.

03:09:46.775 --> 03:09:48.744
NO.

03:09:48.810 --> 03:09:50.746
IS IT PART OF A BROADER PUBLIC

03:09:50.812 --> 03:09:53.148

NOW IN THE PAST WITH BILLS TO

03:09:59.654 --> 03:10:02.057
PUT A TAX ON SODAS THE

03:10:02.124 --> 03:10:09.831
INDUSTRY'S RESPONSE RESPONDED TO

03:10:09.898 --> 03:10:11.433
THAT CALL.

03:10:11.500 --> 03:10:13.168
IN THE LABEL WARNING IS JUST

03:10:13.235 --> 03:10:14.936
THAT IT'S EDUCATION.

03:10:15.003 --> 03:10:17.139
IT'S CONSUMER RIGHT TO KNOW.

03:10:17.205 --> 03:10:20.041
IF DOCTORS KNOW IT'S BAD FOR YOU

03:10:20.108 --> 03:10:21.576
SHOULDN'T WE GIVE PARENTS.

03:10:21.643 --> 03:10:23.145
THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE INFORMED

EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SO IT IS NOT

03:10:26.648 --> 03:10:28.550
HELPFUL BUT WHAT ABOUT THE

CAMOUFLAGE DRINKS.

03:10:29.951 --> 03:10:31.186

LOADED WITH SUGARS AND THEY

03:10:43.832 --> 03:10:45.333

UNABLE TO KILL THE PROJECT JUST

03:26:41.655 --> 03:26:46.127

SB TWENTY FIVE ALSO CREATES A

03:26:48.662 --> 03:26:50.431
MULTIPLIER PLAYER EFFECT WITH

03:26:50.498 --> 03:26:52.066

LOOKING TO MAKE THE AYE BANK

03:27:13.821 --> 03:27:15.623

03:27:30.404 --> 03:27:31.839
GOVERNOR SEEKS TO INCENTIVIZE

03:27:31.906 --> 03:27:33.908

FEDERAL PROGRAM.

03:27:39.613 --> 03:27:40.915
THIS COULD GENERATE BILLIONS OF

03:27:40.981 --> 03:27:42.383
NEW REVENUE THAT WILL BE MATCHED

03:27:42.449 --> 03:27:44.185

WEALTHY INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUALS

SEVENTY NINE CENSUS TRACKS THAT

MENTIONED ARE COULD BE ANYTHING

03:29:43.237 --> 03:29:44.571
WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A

03:29:44.638 --> 03:29:46.173
LIMITED HOUSING TRACT.

03:29:46.240 --> 03:29:47.808

REQUIREMENTS REMEMBER.

03:29:54.415 --> 03:29:55.950
SEE QUIRK IS THE ONLY.

03:29:56.016 --> 03:29:57.851
PLANNING.

03:29:57.918 --> 03:29:59.253
THE VICE.

03:29:59.320 --> 03:30:01.655
THAT IS THE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

03:30:01.722 --> 03:30:03.324
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE

03:30:03.390 --> 03:30:05.960
PROJECT.

03:30:06.026 --> 03:30:08.028
THAT'S WHAT SEE WHAT IS.

03:30:08.095 --> 03:30:10.531
THAT IS THE ONLY CONSIDERATION

03:30:10.597 --> 03:30:11.565
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT COMES UNDER

03:30:11.632 --> 03:30:15.536
SEQUEL.

03:30:15.602 --> 03:30:17.738
WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS WE ARE

03:30:17.805 --> 03:30:19.940
GOING TO IGNORE OR WE ARE GOING

03:30:20.007 --> 03:30:22.242
TO CIRCUMVENT ENVIRONMENTAL

03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:24.044
CONSIDERATIONS?

03:30:24.111 --> 03:30:26.013
AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT WE

03:30:26.080 --> 03:30:27.948
HAVE NEEDS IN THE STATE. TO GET

03:30:28.015 --> 03:30:28.983
RID OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:30:29.049 --> 03:30:31.652
CONSIDERATIONS RUNS CONTRARY I

03:30:31.719 --> 03:30:33.020
BELIEVE TO THE WILL OF

03:30:33.087 --> 03:30:34.655
CALIFORNIANS.

03:30:34.722 --> 03:30:35.155
SO.

03:30:35.222 --> 03:30:37.324
WHILE I APPRECIATE WE HAVE WORK

03:30:37.391 --> 03:30:38.993
TO DO. TWO OF THIS CHARADE

03:30:39.059 --> 03:30:42.329
SEQUEL IS SIMPLY NOT THE RIGHT

03:30:42.396 --> 03:30:44.031
WAY TO GO IN WITH THAT I WOULD

03:30:44.098 --> 03:30:45.733
RESPECTFULLY.

03:30:45.799 --> 03:30:47.434
ORIGIN OVERLOOKED.

03:30:47.501 --> 03:30:49.003
SENATOR ALSO.

03:30:49.069 --> 03:30:53.207
YES -- TO MY SENT -- SENATOR

03:30:53.273 --> 03:30:54.708
FROM SALINAS.

03:30:54.775 --> 03:30:57.411
MY CONCERNS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO

03:30:57.478 --> 03:30:58.412
WHAT THE SENATOR FROM SANTA

03:30:58.479 --> 03:31:01.081
BARBARA RAISED AN YESTERDAY I

03:31:01.148 --> 03:31:02.649
VOTED FOR A BILL.

03:31:02.716 --> 03:31:05.052
THAT DID MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR

03:31:05.119 --> 03:31:06.820
SEQUEL.

03:31:06.887 --> 03:31:08.622
UP BECAUSE IT WAS VERY IN MY

03:31:08.689 --> 03:31:09.957
OPINION NARROW AND IT WAS

03:31:10.024 --> 03:31:11.392
FOCUSED.

03:31:11.458 --> 03:31:13.794
THIS IS WAY WAY BEYOND THAT.

03:31:13.861 --> 03:31:16.230
THIS IS ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES

03:31:16.296 --> 03:31:17.765
ZONES AND WHEN I FIRST LOOKED.

03:31:17.831 --> 03:31:19.833
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT

03:31:19.900 --> 03:31:21.301
IT WAS FOR HOUSING.

03:31:21.368 --> 03:31:23.270
BUT AS WE LOOK MORE INTO IT AS I

03:31:23.337 --> 03:31:23.937
DID.

03:31:24.004 --> 03:31:25.906
I REALIZE THIS IS FOR EVERY

03:31:25.973 --> 03:31:28.876
SINGLE KIND OF PROJECT IN EVERY

03:31:28.942 --> 03:31:30.411
SINGLE OPPORTUNITIES OWN.

03:31:30.477 --> 03:31:33.313
THAT IS I THINK GOING.

03:31:33.380 --> 03:31:36.216
PAST THE LINE AND I BELIEVE THAT

03:31:36.283 --> 03:31:38.652
IN YOUR HEART YOU ARE REALLY

03:31:38.719 --> 03:31:39.920
DOING THIS FOR ALL THE RIGHT

03:31:39.987 --> 03:31:41.655
REASONS WE HAVE TO DO MORE

03:31:41.722 --> 03:31:43.457
DRAMATIC THINGS.

03:31:43.524 --> 03:31:44.358
BUT I THINK TAKING IN

03:31:44.425 --> 03:31:44.658
[inaudible]

03:31:44.725 --> 03:31:46.360
AWAY.

03:31:46.427 --> 03:31:48.729
THIS AS A PROTECTION FOR OUR

03:31:48.796 --> 03:31:50.564
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE POOR

03:31:50.631 --> 03:31:52.366
COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES WHO

03:31:52.433 --> 03:31:54.068
SUFFER.

03:31:54.134 --> 03:31:56.170
ENORMOUSLY FROM CONTAMINATION

03:31:56.236 --> 03:31:57.771
AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

03:31:57.838 --> 03:31:59.139
TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM POOR

03:31:59.206 --> 03:32:01.508
COMMUNITIES IS ALSO A DIS

03:32:01.575 --> 03:32:03.177
SERVICE TO THEM.

03:32:03.243 --> 03:32:05.813
I WAS I REMEMBER I LED.

03:32:05.879 --> 03:32:08.215
UP PIECE OF LEGISLATION YEARS

03:32:08.282 --> 03:32:10.284
AGO WHICH WAS THE FIRST TIME.

03:32:10.350 --> 03:32:12.786
THAT WE DID DO AN EXPEDITED

03:32:12.853 --> 03:32:15.989
JUDICIAL REVIEW ON A PROJECT OF

03:32:16.056 --> 03:32:19.426
OF SEQUEL -- AND I BELIEVE VERY

03:32:19.493 --> 03:32:22.129
MUCH THAT THERE IS A PLACE AND A

03:32:22.196 --> 03:32:23.764
TIME TO DO THAT.

03:32:23.831 --> 03:32:25.532
UP BUT I UNDER UNFORTUNATELY

03:32:25.599 --> 03:32:27.601
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS TRYING TO

03:32:27.668 --> 03:32:30.270
COVER EVERYTHING TOO MUCH.

03:32:30.337 --> 03:32:32.573
AND EVERYTHING FROM STADIUMS AND

03:32:32.639 --> 03:32:34.374
HOTELS.

03:32:34.441 --> 03:32:36.510
TO SOME HOUSING YOU NAME IT AND

03:32:36.577 --> 03:32:37.478
I THINK THAT'S GOING TOO FAR

03:32:37.544 --> 03:32:39.880
THANK YOU.

03:32:39.947 --> 03:32:41.548
SENATOR WHY BECAUSE THANK YOU

03:32:53.293 --> 03:32:56.263
BILL THE ZERO NET ENERGY -- TO

03:39:49.576 --> 03:39:50.510
INCLUSIVE AND SAFE. FOR THE

03:39:50.577 --> 03:39:52.112
ENVIRONMENT.

03:39:52.178 --> 03:39:53.780
BILL IS SUPPORTED BY A COALITION

03:39:53.847 --> 03:39:55.515
HOUSING ADVOCATES NONPROFITS AND

03:39:55.582 --> 03:39:57.517
BUSINESS GROUPS I RESPECTFULLY

03:39:57.584 --> 03:39:59.786

THANK YOU SOONER ACOSTA.

03:40:02.756 --> 03:40:04.057
MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN

03:40:04.124 --> 03:40:07.427
OPPOSITION OF THE MEASURE -- THE

03:40:07.494 --> 03:40:08.895
SIX THIS THIS MEASURE VOTED NO

03:40:08.962 --> 03:40:10.196
IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND

03:40:10.263 --> 03:40:13.033
ALSO AN ISSUE ONCE AGAIN THIS

03:40:13.099 --> 03:40:14.434
TAKES.

03:40:14.501 --> 03:40:16.636
A BIG JUMP ON ALL HOUSING

03:40:16.703 --> 03:40:18.104
PROJECTS THAT GO THROUGH THE

03:40:18.171 --> 03:40:19.839
SECRET PROCESS YOU KNOW WE'VE

03:40:19.906 --> 03:40:21.608
SAID TIME AND AGAIN THAT THE

03:40:21.675 --> 03:40:23.677
ONLY OPPORTUNITY THAT THE PUBLIC

03:40:23.743 --> 03:40:25.145
CAST OBJECT.

03:40:25.211 --> 03:40:26.513
TO THAT THE PROJECT IS TO FILE A

03:40:26.580 --> 03:40:28.181
LAWSUIT AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

03:40:28.248 --> 03:40:29.649
WE'RE FORCING EVERY HOUSING

03:40:29.716 --> 03:40:30.784
PROJECT IN THE STATE OF

03:40:30.850 --> 03:40:32.485
CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A FINAL

03:40:32.552 --> 03:40:35.088
JUDICIAL DETERMINATION IN TWO

03:40:35.155 --> 03:40:36.456
HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS IS JUST.

03:40:36.523 --> 03:40:37.891
WHO DO JUSTICE WE DON'T AND THE

03:40:37.958 --> 03:40:39.459
COURTS CANNOT POSSIBLY GET

03:40:39.526 --> 03:40:41.928
THROUGH THE DAY THE DETAIL OF OF

03:40:41.995 --> 03:40:43.396
INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S A

03:40:43.463 --> 03:40:44.898
NEGATIVE DECK WARRANTY AYE AYE

03:40:44.965 --> 03:40:46.700
COMPLETE E. R. R. TAKES SPLIT

03:40:46.766 --> 03:40:48.268
EXPECT THEM TO DO THIS ON EVERY

03:40:48.335 --> 03:40:49.302
HOUSING?

03:40:49.369 --> 03:40:54.074
PROJECT IS JUST TOO MUCH HI BUT

03:40:54.140 --> 03:40:55.909
DON'T -- A QUESTION THAT THE

03:40:55.976 --> 03:40:56.610
AUTHORS DETERMINATION TO MAKE

03:40:56.676 --> 03:40:58.144
SURE THAT WE ADDRESS OUR HOUSING

03:40:58.211 --> 03:40:59.946
CRISIS BUT THIS IS JUST SIMPLY

03:41:00.013 --> 03:41:02.048
NOT THE WAY. TO DO IT OUR COURTS

03:41:02.115 --> 03:41:03.350
ARE GOING TO GET CRUSHED UNDER

03:41:03.416 --> 03:41:06.920
THIS AND I REGION I VOEPEL NOVO.

03:41:06.987 --> 03:41:08.688
ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF IT

03:41:08.755 --> 03:41:10.223
ON THE SIDE OF SENATOR JACKSON.

03:41:10.290 --> 03:41:12.792
YES -- NOT TO BELABOR THE POINT

03:41:12.859 --> 03:41:15.629
WE'LL KEEP ON TRUCKIN BUT THIS

03:41:15.695 --> 03:41:16.563
BILL.

03:41:16.630 --> 03:41:18.565
APPLIES INSTANCES IN THE

03:41:18.632 --> 03:41:20.800
ANALYSIS TO AN UNKNOWN.

03:41:20.867 --> 03:41:24.104
NUMBER OF FUTURE PROJECTS WITH

03:41:24.170 --> 03:41:25.472
UNKNOWN IMPACTS.

03:41:25.538 --> 03:41:27.607
SINCE THE PROJECTS ARE UNDEFINED

03:41:27.674 --> 03:41:29.442
IT'S DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THEIR

03:41:29.509 --> 03:41:31.911
MERITS MUCH LESS WHETHER THOSE

03:41:31.978 --> 03:41:33.413
MERITS JUSTIFY.

03:41:33.480 --> 03:41:35.348
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT THIS IS

03:41:35.415 --> 03:41:37.851
OPENING A MASSIVE HOLE IN THE

03:41:37.917 --> 03:41:39.719
WHOLE PROCESS PERHAPS I WAS

03:41:39.786 --> 03:41:41.921
SPEAKING TO STRONGLY TO SAY THIS

03:41:41.988 --> 03:41:43.056
WILL OF THIS RATE SEQUEL.

03:41:43.123 --> 03:41:45.025
BUT I WILL BET YOU THAT THIS

03:41:45.091 --> 03:41:47.594
KIND OF CONTINUED EFFORT WILL

03:41:47.661 --> 03:41:50.263
INDEED EVISCERATE SYKORA AND

03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:52.332
ALTHOUGH WE MAY NOT LOOK LIKE

03:41:52.399 --> 03:41:54.701
MIAMI BEACH TOMORROW IF WE KEEP

03:41:54.768 --> 03:41:57.504
DOING THIS WE WILL LOOK LIKE

03:41:57.570 --> 03:41:59.706
MIAMI BEACH IN THE FUTURE --

03:41:59.773 --> 03:42:00.907
INTO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF SAN

03:42:00.974 --> 03:42:02.409
FRANCISCO.

03:42:02.475 --> 03:42:04.711
YOU SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WITH

03:42:04.778 --> 03:42:05.879
RAMPANT GROWTH.

03:42:05.945 --> 03:42:07.013
WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING THIS

03:42:07.080 --> 03:42:08.682
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WITHOUT

03:42:08.748 --> 03:42:10.150
OUR ABILITY TO DO THE

03:42:10.216 --> 03:42:12.218
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AS THE

03:42:12.285 --> 03:42:14.220
GOOD SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES

03:42:14.287 --> 03:42:15.388
POINTED OUT.

03:42:15.455 --> 03:42:17.657
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO TO HELP

03:42:17.724 --> 03:42:19.693
THE UNDERSERVED WILL HURT THEM?

03:42:19.759 --> 03:42:22.095
NOT HELP THEM AND WITH THAT I

03:42:22.162 --> 03:42:24.130
RESPECTFULLY REGIONAL VOTE.

03:42:24.197 --> 03:42:26.433
THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL

03:42:26.499 --> 03:42:27.000
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS

03:42:27.067 --> 03:42:28.535
ITEM.

03:42:28.601 --> 03:42:29.936
SENATOR DEALERS OR TO LIKE CLOSE

03:42:30.003 --> 03:42:30.737
THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT

03:42:30.804 --> 03:42:32.539
MEMBERS I THINK IT'S ALL OF US

03:42:32.605 --> 03:42:34.274
ARE AWARE WE HAVE A HOUSING

03:42:34.340 --> 03:42:35.508
PROBLEM IN THE STATE.

03:42:35.575 --> 03:42:37.644
AND THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS WE'RE

03:42:37.711 --> 03:42:38.945
WORKING TO TRY TO DEAL WITH IT.

03:42:39.012 --> 03:42:40.447
THIS BILL IS ONLY FOCUSED ON

03:42:40.513 --> 03:42:41.948
AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOT ALL

03:42:42.015 --> 03:42:44.384
HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

03:42:44.451 --> 03:42:45.485
SOMETHING WHICH I THINK WE CAN

03:42:45.552 --> 03:42:47.387
ALL AGREE.

03:42:47.454 --> 03:42:48.555
THERE WAS A REPORT ISSUED -- I

03:42:48.621 --> 03:42:50.356
GUESS MAYBE LESS THAN TWO YEARS

03:42:50.423 --> 03:42:52.092
AGO BY OUR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

03:42:52.158 --> 03:42:52.992
COMMITTEE.

03:42:53.059 --> 03:42:54.928
THAT ANALYZE THE CHALLENGES --

03:42:54.994 --> 03:42:56.930
THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD ON

03:42:56.996 --> 03:42:58.765
THE ISSUE OF SEQUEL TO ADDRESS

03:42:58.832 --> 03:43:00.467
THIS ISSUE IS IT A BIG PROBLEM

03:43:00.533 --> 03:43:02.135
OR IS IT A LITTLE PROBLEM.

03:43:02.202 --> 03:43:03.103
AND THE CONCLUSION THAT THAT

03:43:03.169 --> 03:43:04.637
COMMITTEE REACH WAS THAT IT'S A

03:43:04.704 --> 03:43:05.972
VERY SMALL PROBLEM.

03:43:06.039 --> 03:43:07.440
THAT ONLY A FRACTION OF THE

03:43:07.507 --> 03:43:08.908
CHALLENGES ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING

03:43:08.975 --> 03:43:10.110
PROJECTS.

03:43:10.176 --> 03:43:11.511
ARE ON THE ISSUE OF SEQUEL.

03:43:11.578 --> 03:43:13.313
SO THE SUGGESTION THIS IS GOING

03:43:13.379 --> 03:43:16.716
TO CLOG THE COURTS I THINK HIS --

03:43:16.783 --> 03:43:20.019
MASSIVELY OVERBLOWN.

03:43:20.086 --> 03:43:22.655
IN FACT THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT

03:43:22.722 --> 03:43:23.990
THERE WOULD BE FEW CHALLENGES --

03:43:24.057 --> 03:43:26.426
UNDER THE EFFORT THAT WE'RE ALL

03:43:26.493 --> 03:43:27.694
PUTTING IN TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

03:43:27.761 --> 03:43:29.262
HOUSING BUT IF THERE IS WE'RE

03:43:29.329 --> 03:43:30.830
SIMPLY ASKING NOT THAT THE COURT

03:43:30.897 --> 03:43:31.998
EGGMAN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:43:32.065 --> 03:43:33.767
STANDARDS AND RULES.

03:43:33.833 --> 03:43:35.435
BUT THEY EXPEDITE THE REVIEW IT

03:43:35.502 --> 03:43:36.770
DOESN'T PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE

03:43:36.836 --> 03:43:38.838
OF JUSTICE ON ONE SIDE OR THE

03:43:38.905 --> 03:43:40.240
OTHER IT'S SIMPLY SAYS RESOLVE

03:43:40.306 --> 03:43:41.541
THE ISSUE.

03:43:41.608 --> 03:43:42.942
IN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS.

03:43:43.009 --> 03:43:44.310
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TO BUILD

03:43:44.377 --> 03:43:46.446
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE

03:43:46.513 --> 03:43:47.814
STATE IS NOT GOING TO REQUIRE.

03:43:47.881 --> 03:43:49.349
SIMPLY THE ACT OF OUR BUDGET

03:43:49.415 --> 03:43:51.251
THAT WE CAN FIND AND AND BY OUR

03:43:51.317 --> 03:43:52.619
WAY OUT OF THAT PROBLEM.

03:43:52.685 --> 03:43:53.920
IT'S GONNA REQUIRE THE PRIVATE

03:43:53.987 --> 03:43:55.889
SECTOR TO INVEST IN THESE

03:43:55.955 --> 03:43:57.624
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS TO

03:43:57.690 --> 03:43:59.025
TAKE THE RISK AND THE CHANCE.

03:43:59.092 --> 03:44:00.226
OF THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

03:44:00.293 --> 03:44:02.061
WE KNOW WE NEED TO BE INVESTED

03:44:02.128 --> 03:44:04.364
IN BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

03:44:04.430 --> 03:44:07.600
AND THAT WILL ONLY COME FOR A

03:44:07.667 --> 03:44:08.902
VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING.

03:44:08.968 --> 03:44:11.337
SOME ELEMENT OF CERTAINTY THAT

03:44:11.404 --> 03:44:12.605
WHATEVER THAT IS IS ON THE

03:44:12.672 --> 03:44:15.608
PROJECT THEY CAN GET RESOLVED IN

03:44:15.675 --> 03:44:17.010
A TIMELY WAY.

03:44:17.076 --> 03:44:18.411
WHEN A PROJECT GOES TO THE

03:44:18.478 --> 03:44:20.013
SEQUEL PROCESS?

03:44:20.079 --> 03:44:21.681
IT'S NOT JUST ALL ABOUT.

03:44:21.748 --> 03:44:22.382
SIX IT'S A GOVERNING

03:44:22.448 --> 03:44:24.684
JURISDICTION REVEALING IT AND

03:44:24.751 --> 03:44:26.753
MAKING CHOICES CITY COUNCIL'S

03:44:26.820 --> 03:44:29.088
BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS LOOKING AT

03:44:29.155 --> 03:44:30.623
ALL THE ISSUES AOUND A PROJECT

03:44:30.690 --> 03:44:31.758
INCLUDING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL

03:44:31.825 --> 03:44:34.027
DOCUMENT AND MAKING A JUDGMENT.

03:44:34.093 --> 03:44:35.528
I CHALLENGE ON SEQUEL IN MOST

03:44:35.595 --> 03:44:37.597
CASES UNDER THIS BILL WILL BE

03:44:37.664 --> 03:44:38.998
AFTER THAT JURISDICTION'S

03:44:39.065 --> 03:44:40.433
DECIDED THAT THAT AFFORDABLE

03:44:40.500 --> 03:44:41.301
PROJECT IS.

03:44:41.367 --> 03:44:43.169
THOUGHTFULLY DONE REASONABLE

03:44:43.236 --> 03:44:44.604
NECESSARY IT COMPLIES WITH THE

03:44:44.671 --> 03:44:47.006
QUOTE.

03:44:47.073 --> 03:44:47.607
THIS BILL ONLY DEALS WITH THE

03:44:47.674 --> 03:44:48.208
CHALLENGES.

03:44:48.274 --> 03:44:49.175
AND IN SOME CASES IT'S ARGUED

03:44:49.242 --> 03:44:50.677
THEIR RARE.

03:44:50.743 --> 03:44:52.178
BUT ITS FOCUS IS ON AFFORDABLE

03:44:52.245 --> 03:44:53.446
HOUSING WITH HIGHER

03:44:53.513 --> 03:44:54.681
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.

03:44:54.747 --> 03:44:55.815
I THINK IT'S DESERVING OUR

03:44:55.882 --> 03:44:57.917

03:44:57.984 --> 03:45:00.787

BY THE MOVING OF INDIVIDUALS

04:35:56.940 --> 04:35:58.408
BASED ON RISK OR DANGER IS BASED

04:35:58.475 --> 04:35:59.542
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF GENDER

04:35:59.609 --> 04:36:00.777
IDENTITY IS THAT CORRECT.

04:36:00.844 --> 04:36:02.545
I'M SORRY I CAN YOU REPEAT THAT.

04:36:02.612 --> 04:36:05.749
THE REMOVAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL

04:36:05.815 --> 04:36:08.418
BASED ON RISK OR DANGER IS ONLY

04:36:08.485 --> 04:36:10.353
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF GENDER

04:36:10.420 --> 04:36:12.989
IDENTITY IS THAT CORRECT.

04:36:13.056 --> 04:36:15.492
THE THE THE THE GOAL OF THE

04:36:15.558 --> 04:36:17.661
BILL'S PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE THAT

04:36:17.727 --> 04:36:18.828
IF SOMEONE.

04:36:18.895 --> 04:36:20.430
IF THAT PERSON GENDER IDENTITY

04:36:20.497 --> 04:36:21.564
IS [inaudible]

04:36:21.631 --> 04:36:23.600
EMAIL.

04:36:23.667 --> 04:36:24.734
AND THE PERSON WILL BE HOUSE AS

04:36:24.801 --> 04:36:27.971
A FEMALE.

04:36:28.038 --> 04:36:29.940
THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL OF

04:36:30.006 --> 04:36:31.841
THE BILL AND SAFETY AND SECURITY

04:36:31.908 --> 04:36:33.443
IS PART OF THAT.

04:36:33.510 --> 04:36:34.577
BUT IT'S NOT.

04:36:34.644 --> 04:36:36.012
THE ENTIRETY IT'S REALLY ABOUT

04:36:36.079 --> 04:36:38.014
TREATING PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AS

04:36:38.081 --> 04:36:39.082
WHO THEY ARE.

04:36:39.149 --> 04:36:41.251
INSTEAD OF SAYING WE'RE GOING TO

04:36:41.318 --> 04:36:43.787
TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE CERTAINLY

04:36:43.853 --> 04:36:44.754
AND AND MAYBE I'LL JUST POSE MY

04:36:44.821 --> 04:36:45.889
DIRECT QUESTION TO YOU.

04:36:45.956 --> 04:36:48.024
DOES THIS CREATE A SCENARIO IN

04:36:48.091 --> 04:36:50.226
YOUR OPINION -- THE INDIVIDUALS

04:36:50.293 --> 04:36:53.697
ARTIFICIALLY EXPRESSING A RISK

04:36:53.763 --> 04:36:57.033
FOR A DANGER TO SHOP. FIVE

04:36:57.100 --> 04:36:57.667
PLACES WHERE THEY WILL BE HELD

04:36:57.734 --> 04:36:59.502
SO THEY CAN MOVE FROM POINT A TO

04:36:59.569 --> 04:37:00.770
POINT B..

04:37:00.837 --> 04:37:04.441
BECAUSE OF A PERCEIVED RISK I I

04:37:04.507 --> 04:37:06.142
I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT THAT

04:37:06.209 --> 04:37:08.511
IS A REAL RISK HERE THAT WAS

04:37:08.578 --> 04:37:10.080
OKAY -- DIE THAT'S AN ARGUMENT

04:37:10.146 --> 04:37:11.481
THAT WE SOMETIMES HEAR WITH THE

04:37:11.548 --> 04:37:13.984
SO CALLED ODD BATHROOM BILLS YOU

04:37:14.050 --> 04:37:15.552
MAY RECALL IN NORTH CAROLINA.

04:37:15.618 --> 04:37:17.954
THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL --

04:37:18.021 --> 04:37:19.856
SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO USE THE

04:37:19.923 --> 04:37:22.359
RESTROOM THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE

04:37:22.425 --> 04:37:23.727
GENDER ASSIGNED TO A BIRTH AND

04:37:23.793 --> 04:37:25.495
THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT PEOPLE

04:37:25.562 --> 04:37:28.098
WERE GOING TO USE THE THE A

04:37:28.164 --> 04:37:29.866
RESTROOM IN ORDER TO ASSAULT

04:37:29.933 --> 04:37:31.234
PEOPLE -- THERE WAS NEVER ANY

04:37:31.301 --> 04:37:34.404
EVIDENCE OF THAT -- AND AND THAT

04:37:34.471 --> 04:37:35.972
LAW WAS ULTIMATELY A CAMERA CREW

04:37:36.039 --> 04:37:38.308
WAS REPEALED OR SCALE BACK --

04:37:38.375 --> 04:37:39.209
YOU KNOW THE I. SO I DON'T SEE

04:37:39.275 --> 04:37:41.144
THAT -- AS A RISK AND AGAIN CITY

04:37:41.211 --> 04:37:44.214
SIR DOES HAVE FLEXIBILITY -- TO

04:37:44.280 --> 04:37:45.648
MAKE A SECURITY ASSESSMENT

04:37:45.715 --> 04:37:47.484
SPECIFIC THAT INDIVIDUAL -- SO

04:37:47.550 --> 04:37:54.090
THERE IS NOT FLEXIBILITY BUILT

04:37:54.157 --> 04:37:56.526
INTO THE LAW [inaudible]

04:37:56.593 --> 04:37:57.894

05:40:49.162 --> 05:40:50.062
WANTED TO DO HOUSING AND I

05:40:50.129 --> 05:40:53.065
LEARNED A LOT -- IN THE IN THE

05:40:53.132 --> 05:40:54.467
MID NINETIES WHEN I WENT TO WORK

05:40:54.534 --> 05:40:58.070
FOR HER. 10% VACANCY RATES IN

05:40:58.137 --> 05:41:00.773
NORTH PARKING MY COLLEAGUE FROM --

05:41:00.840 --> 05:41:04.477
SAN DIEGO -- AND AND SOUTHERN

05:41:04.544 --> 05:41:06.179
SAN DIEGO WILL REMEMBER THIS --

05:41:06.245 --> 05:41:07.513
BECAUSE HE WORKED IN THE

05:41:07.580 --> 05:41:09.615
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY A NUMBER OF

05:41:09.682 --> 05:41:11.784
YEARS -- AS THAT WE WERE COMING

05:41:11.851 --> 05:41:13.486
OUT OF THAT RECESSION.

05:41:13.553 --> 05:41:16.923
AT 10% VACANCIES 12% VACANCIES --

05:41:16.989 --> 05:41:21.194
AND LAND OF PROPERTY OWNERS

05:41:21.260 --> 05:41:24.030
SMALL COMPLEXES THEY COUNTED.

05:41:24.096 --> 05:41:25.331
ON THE SAN DIEGO HUSING

05:41:25.398 --> 05:41:27.433
COMMISSION TO BE A PARTNER WITH

05:41:27.500 --> 05:41:29.068
THEM AT THAT TIME.

05:41:29.135 --> 05:41:31.337
THERE WERE THERE WAS NO DEBATE

05:41:31.404 --> 05:41:33.072
AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE TYPE

05:41:33.139 --> 05:41:35.575
OF PEOPLE OR YOU KNOW THESE ARE

05:41:35.641 --> 05:41:38.144
SMALL -- PROPERTY OWNERS WHO

05:41:38.211 --> 05:41:39.512
WERE STRUGGLING.

05:41:39.579 --> 05:41:41.614
AND SO THEY WERE HAPPY TO

05:41:41.681 --> 05:41:45.284
PARTICIPATE -- THE OTHER THING I

05:41:45.351 --> 05:41:47.386
WOULD SAY -- THIS REALLY IS

05:41:47.453 --> 05:41:48.654
ABOUT OPPORTUNITY NOT

05:41:48.721 --> 05:41:51.324
REQUIREMENTS BUT OPPORTUNITY AND

05:41:51.390 --> 05:41:52.692
I THINK WHEN YOU MEET THE

05:41:52.758 --> 05:41:54.327
FAMILIES AND THE INDIVIDUALS

05:41:54.393 --> 05:41:56.095
THAT ARE ON THESE WAITING LISTS

05:41:56.162 --> 05:41:57.830
THAT HAVE WAITED SO LONG.

05:41:57.897 --> 05:42:00.099
AND YOU YOU SEE WHO THEY ARE

05:42:00.166 --> 05:42:01.000
THESE ARE STRUGGLING

05:42:01.067 --> 05:42:03.069
CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED A HOME WHO

05:42:03.135 --> 05:42:06.672
HAVE WAITED -- AND IF YOU ALSO

05:42:06.739 --> 05:42:09.642
THEN LOOK AT THE REQUIREMENTS AS

05:42:09.709 --> 05:42:13.079
AS MY COLLEAGUE OFFROM OUR SAN

05:42:13.145 --> 05:42:14.647
FERNANDO VALLEY POINTED OUT.

05:42:14.714 --> 05:42:18.417
IF YOU LOOK AT THE REQUIREMENTS.

05:42:18.484 --> 05:42:19.886
MANY PEOPLE HAVE A PERCEPTION

05:42:19.952 --> 05:42:22.021
THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE

05:42:22.088 --> 05:42:23.756
VOUCHERS.

05:42:23.823 --> 05:42:26.592
SOMEHOW THEY'RE NOT GOOD TENANTS.

05:42:26.659 --> 05:42:28.294
AND I RECALL AS A STAFF MEMBER

05:42:28.361 --> 05:42:30.129
GETTING THOSE COMPLAINTS AND I

05:42:30.196 --> 05:42:32.198
WAS A I DID CONSTITUENTS

05:42:32.265 --> 05:42:34.600
SERVICES AND I RECALL.

05:42:34.667 --> 05:42:36.202
TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO SAID I

05:42:36.269 --> 05:42:37.870
KNOW THAT UNIT IN THAT BUILDING

05:42:37.937 --> 05:42:40.606
IS A PROBLEM I KNOW IT'S SECTION

05:42:40.673 --> 05:42:41.741
EIGHT IT'S PUBLIC HOUSING.

05:42:41.807 --> 05:42:42.909
AND THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE THERE

05:42:42.975 --> 05:42:44.410
DISRUPTING MY QUIET THEY'RE

05:42:44.477 --> 05:42:45.745
DOING THIS OR DOING THAT IN

05:42:45.811 --> 05:42:48.347
AVIDLY I WOULD CHECK ON THAT.

05:42:48.414 --> 05:42:50.983
ADDRESS AND THAT UNIT AND FIND

05:42:51.050 --> 05:42:52.118
OUT THERE WERE NO SECTION EIGHT

05:42:52.184 --> 05:42:54.053
TENANTS IN THAT BUILDING THERE

05:42:54.120 --> 05:42:55.354
WERE NO UNITS.

05:42:55.421 --> 05:42:56.389
THEY WERE ALL MARKET RATE

05:42:56.455 --> 05:42:56.689
[inaudible]

05:42:56.756 --> 05:42:58.391
HOUSING.

05:42:58.457 --> 05:42:59.625
SO.

05:42:59.692 --> 05:43:00.660
YOU KNOW THERE WAS A POINT IN

05:43:00.726 --> 05:43:02.728
TIME MY POINT IN ALL THIS THERE

05:43:02.795 --> 05:43:03.429
WAS A POINT IN TIME WHEN

05:43:03.496 --> 05:43:05.398
PROPERTY OWNERS.

05:43:05.464 --> 05:43:05.998
WE'RE PARTNERS BECAUSE THEY

05:43:06.065 --> 05:43:08.134
NEEDED THERE THEY NEEDED THIS

05:43:08.200 --> 05:43:09.802
THE CHECK THEY NEEDED THE THE

05:43:09.869 --> 05:43:11.404
SUPPORT TO TO KEEP THEIR

05:43:11.470 --> 05:43:12.538
PROPERTY.

05:43:12.605 --> 05:43:15.374
AS THEIR PROPERTY AND MAKE IT --

05:43:15.441 --> 05:43:17.944
VIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AND SO IT

05:43:18.010 --> 05:43:20.613
WAS FINE. TO ALLOW OPPORTUNITY

05:43:20.680 --> 05:43:23.649
AND ACCESS AT THAT TIME.

05:43:23.716 --> 05:43:25.217
ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE A MARKET

05:43:25.284 --> 05:43:27.853
THAT IS LESS THAN 5% LESS THAN

05:43:27.920 --> 05:43:28.587
3%.

05:43:28.654 --> 05:43:30.389
AND P. AND AND PEOPLE CAN BE

05:43:30.456 --> 05:43:31.757
MORE CHOOSY AND THEY THINK IF

05:43:31.824 --> 05:43:33.326
THEY CAN BE MORE PICKY PICKY IN

05:43:33.392 --> 05:43:34.393
CHOOSING.

05:43:34.460 --> 05:43:35.828
THEY WILL HAVE BETTER TENNIS

05:43:35.895 --> 05:43:38.698
IT'S A MYTH IT'S IT'S A FALSE.

05:43:38.764 --> 05:43:40.900
PREMISE BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

05:43:40.967 --> 05:43:42.635
THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES

05:43:42.702 --> 05:43:44.036
THAT ARE IN THOSE UNITS.

05:43:44.103 --> 05:43:45.604
THEY TEND TO BE THE ONES THAT

05:43:45.671 --> 05:43:47.540
FOLLOW THE RULES THAT ARE SO

05:43:47.606 --> 05:43:48.607
GRATEFUL TO BE GIVEN THIS

05:43:48.674 --> 05:43:50.176
OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THEY'VE

05:43:50.242 --> 05:43:51.544
WAITED SO LONG.

05:43:51.610 --> 05:43:52.578
SO.

05:43:52.645 --> 05:43:53.646
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

05:43:53.713 --> 05:43:55.581
DISCONNECT HAPPENED OVER THE

05:43:55.648 --> 05:43:57.750
YEARS THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY WAS

05:43:57.817 --> 05:44:00.453
SOMEHOW GONE WHEN IT REALLYUSED

05:44:00.519 --> 05:44:02.088
TO BE THERE FOR FAMILIES.

05:44:02.154 --> 05:44:03.756
THE DISCRIMINATION WAS LESS

05:44:03.823 --> 05:44:06.726
LIKELY WHEN PEOPLE NEEDED THE

05:44:06.792 --> 05:44:07.994
SUPPORT AND THE RESOURCE.

05:44:08.060 --> 05:44:09.495
SO I JUST FROM PERSONAL

05:44:09.562 --> 05:44:15.401
EXPERIENCE I KNOW A GUY YEAH WE

05:44:15.468 --> 05:44:16.202
WE ARE.

05:44:16.268 --> 05:44:16.869
WE MAYBE SPEND A LITTLE TOO MUCH

05:44:16.936 --> 05:44:17.837
TIME TALKING ABOUT FROM PERSONAL

05:44:17.903 --> 05:44:19.105

ALL ACROSS THE STATE -- WHERE

05:50:53.332 --> 05:50:55.934
