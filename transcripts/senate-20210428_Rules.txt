AND MY CHILDREN KEEP ME GROUNDED AND REMIND ME EVERY DAY HOW IMPORTANT THIS WORK IS. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE DJJ FAMILY FOR THEIR DEDICATION TO OUR MISSION. ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CHALLENGING PAST YEAR. I STARTED WORKING AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL IN TERMS OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHEN IT WAS STILL THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY. I WALKED IN EXPECTING TO GAIN SOME EXPERIENCE FIRST SEMESTER BUT INSTEAD DISCOVERED MY LIFE'S PASSION. IT WAS THE USE AND THE CHANCE TO HELP SUPPORT THEM TOWARDS A BETTER FUTURE THAT RESONATED SO STRONGLY WITH ME. THROUGHOUT MY YEARS AT DJJ I'VE BEEN AFFORDED MANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT HAVE ALLOWED ME TO TAKE POSITIONS I NEVER EXPECTED. AND THEY GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP SHAPE PROGRAM PROGRAMMING AND LOOK FOR BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE TREATMENT. THAT IS WHY I'VE STAYED WITH DJJ FOR SO MANY YEARS. GOVERNOR NEWSOMHAS HONORED ME WITH THE APPOINTMENTS A WEEK JJJ AND THIS TIME OF HISTORIC REALIGNMENT OF SERVICES TO YOU. I TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY WITH HUMILITY AND COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT OUR YOUTH WITH QUALITY TREATMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY. ADMIN DOWNSIZING OUR OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT OUR STAFF AS WE NAVIGATE CLOSURE. AS WELL AS BEING ACTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNER WITH OUR STATE AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AS A STREAMLINED CARS. ALTHOUGH MY TENURE IN THIS POSITION WILL BE SHORT. I APPLIED FOR AN ACCEPTED THIS POSITION BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT THE. AND I CARE ABOUT THE STAFF WHO SERVES THEM. IT MATTERS TO ME HOW WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE AS WE CLOSE TO J. J. AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR I'M GONNA START SENATOR LAYERED WITH YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR ARM. AND THANK YOU ARE A DOCTOR FOR. YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND I APPRECIATED THE MEETING WE HAD AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE A MORE TRADITIONAL PATH TO THIS POSITION AND IT GIVES YOU. HI DISCOVERED A PERSPECTIVE THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. I THINK THE ONE THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS INTERESTINGLY YOU'RE ACCEPTING THIS JOB. TO HELP ORGANIZE YOUR JOB OUT OF EXISTENCE A. N. SO IN DOING THAT YOU'VE GOT TO YEARS. AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CHALLENGES YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE CERTAIN CASES. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START TO LOOK FOR OTHER JOBS AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HOLD PEOPLE THERE TILL THE END BECAUSE THE CASES DON'T GO AWAY AS THE TRANSITION HAPPENS. BY A YEAR YOU AND I TALKED PRIVATELY ABOUT THIS I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT. IN PUBLIC IS HOW YOU'RE PREPARED TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE IS WINDING THIS DOWN. YEAH ABSOLUTELY- SO YOU'RE CORRECT IN THAT- YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A CHALLENGE AHEAD OF US OVER THESE NEXT TWO YEARS BUT- I KNOW THAT WE CAN FACE IT. HEAD ON- SO WHEN WE START LOOKING AT HOW WE MAP UT THESE NEXT TWO YEARS THERE'S A COUPLE OF. IMPORTANT TIME FRAMES AND DATES. THAT HELPED DRIVE- WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS WELL AS IMPORT COMPONENTS OF WHAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO. FOR YOU OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE FIRST- THE KEY DATE THAT WE THAT. IMPACTS HOW WE START THIS IS COMMITMENTS TO DJJ. AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL GROUP. AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT INTO HOW WE START MAPPING OUT THESE NEXT TWO YEARS IS THAT- DJJ HAS- PROGRAMMING DEVELOPED TO MEET. USE UNIQUE INDIVIDUAL MEANS WE DO ASSESSMENT WHEN THEY COME IN WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT MATCH. THEIR NEEDS AS WELL AS SOME SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE THEN THE WHOLE PROGRAM THAT ADDRESS- OTHER TREATMENT NEEDS. AND SO IT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS AND TAKE A LOOK AT FULLY. WHO WILL BE COMING TO US OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS- IT. AND HE WILL BE SENTENCED TO DJJ WHAT THEIR TREATMENT NEEDS ARE AND WHERE DOES OUR ULTIMATE NUMBERS LIFE AND NOT THEN HOW WE START LOOKING AT. AS OUR POPULATION DECLINES WHAT NEEDS TO THE REMAINING POPULATION HAVE. WHAT PROGRAMS DO WE NEED TO HAVE UP AND RUNNING HOW DOES THAT IMPACT- HOW WE START TO TAKE DOWN CERTAIN UNITS- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TIME FRAMES. FOR DISABILITIES- DATE BIG. AND MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE CARE FOR OUR YEARS. UNTIL THE VERY LAST DAY. AND SO ONCE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT TREATMENT NEEDS ARE YOU HAVE BEEN THERE'S IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS- AROUND HOW DO WE MAINTAIN THAT TREATMENT. AND LEVEL OF CARE AS AGAIN WE START TO DOWNSIZE SO THAT INVOLVES LOOKING AT- AS OUR NUMBERS GO DOWN ON THE FOR EXAMPLE I MENTAL HEALTH UNIT. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SERVICES ON OUR MENTAL HEALTH UNIT TO THE LAST DAY- NO MATTER IF IT. FIVE TEN YEARS OR FIVE YEARS. SO HOW DO WE PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES ON WHAT. MODELS BUT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CAN STAND WITH OUR MODEL BUT ADAPTING THINGS AS WE- WE DOWNSIZED- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES. AS AS YOU MENTIONED AND I WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT- IN JUST A MOMENT IS- OUR STAFFING- WHO- YOU KNOW WE DO YOU HAVE. VACANCY RATES AND- WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO. YOU WHAT WE CAN IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT ENTERTAINMENT BUT- THAT IS ALSO GOING TO BE A VITAL AS WE MAP OUT. HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES- THAT LEADS TO MORE CONVERSATION THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN THAT SECOND COMPONENT- WITH OUR STAFF. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR OUR STAFF OUR GREATEST RESOURCE AND VITAL TO THE TREATMENT THAT WE PROVIDE. I RELY ON MY STAFF TO PROVIDE CARE AND SUPPORT TO OUR YOUTH. WHICH IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS WE DOWNSIZE AND THERE'S QUESTIONS COMING UP ABOUT NEXT STEPS YOU WILL HAVE. AND SO IN TURN I NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PROVIDING CARE AND SUPPORT TO OUR STAFF. AND SO I'M COMMITTED TO DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP THEM. NAVIGATE THE CLOSURE PROCESS AND SEE THEMTRANSITION INTO NEW ROLES BY WORKING WITH YOU KNOW OUR LABOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND CALLIE CHART AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE. AFFORDED EVERY OPPORTUNITY POSSIBLE- AS WELL AS OPEN COMMUNICATION AROUND THE TIME FRAMES THAT I TALKED ABOUT ORIGINALLY BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO IN PART TO THE QUESTION NOT ONLY ARE YOU HAVE THAT OUR STAFF HAVE ABOUT. WHAT'S. HAPPENING WITH THE UNITS AND FACILITIES- ONE OF THE OTHER BIGGEST COME THAT WE NEED TO WILL BE TACKLING IS THEN FOR USE THAT- THE PROPOSED CLOSURE DATE FOR DJJ IS JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- THERE IS A TRANSITION PLAN THAT WILL BE DO AS- BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO WITH OUR POPULATION WE NEED TO ASSESS WHO. ARE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO DISCHARGE FROM US BY THAT JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE DAY. AND SO WHAT WILL THAT PROCESS BE THAN TO TRANSFER THEM BACK INTO LOCAL CARE. AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT. WE NEED TO INCLUDE OUR PARTNERS AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THOSE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA- THAT COUNTIES. THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS- IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE LOOK AT WHAT THAT PROCESS IS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. THAT EACH OF OUR YOUTH AS I AS I MENTIONED HAVE VERY UIQUE NEEDS AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANSITION WE NEED TO REALIZE IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REENTRY IS A PART DISCHARGED. THIS IS A TRANSFER OF CARE WHICH MEANS WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK CASE BY CASE OUT WHAT EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS EITHER NAME- AND WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS ON HOW WE THEN MAKE SURE THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF CARE. FOR WHATEVER THOSE NEEDS ARE FOR EXAMPLE GOING BACK TO THE MENTAL HEALTH EXAMPLE- THAT LEVEL OF CARE WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE. AND SO I VALUE THE PARTNERSHIPS- WITH ALL OF THOSE AGENCIES AND THE WORK THAT AND CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE ALREADY HAD TOWARDS HOW WE START TO MAP THIS OUT. WE ARE ALL FOCUSED ON THE GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT THESE ARE CARED FOR IN THAT TRANSITION OCCURS. WHEN THINGS POSSIBLE- SO THAT THAT IS AGAIN A LARGE COMPONENT OF WHERE WE NEED TO- MAPPED OUT AND WHEN WE START FACING THOSE THINGS AND YOU KNOW I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ABOUT HOW YOU JUST BALANCE. THE WINDING DOWN OF PEOPLE LOOKING FOR OTHER JOBS AND HAVING TO CONTINUE THE CARE TO THE LAST DAY BUT YOU JUST ANSWERED THAT QUESTION VERY WELL SO LET ME JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER I APPRECIATED AND I APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTY. THAT IT'S GOING GOING TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE VOTING TO CONFIRM YOU LATER AS YOU SEEM TO BE ON TOP OF IT YOU SEEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE ARE THE ISSUES YOU'RE GOING TO FACE OVER THE NEXT. TWO YEARS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. I CENTER GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRETENDING AND AM THINKING MISSILES FOR- TAKING ON THE CHALLENGES MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR LAIRD SAID- FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS WHILE THEY CLOSE DOWN THE DJJ SYSTEM AND- YOU HAVE A BIG JOB IN FRONT OF THE LIKE HE SAID TO KEEP STAFF AND TO MAKE SURE THAT- ED THESE INDIVIDUALS GET PUT IN A FACILITIES IN THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT ARE- THE MORE THAN ADEQUATE ADD TO MEET THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE. SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- WHAT COORDINATION DIFFERENCES DJJ ESTABLISHING TO ENSURE COUNTIES ARE PROPERLY PREPARED TO HOUSE EDUCATE AND PROVIDE TREATMENT FOR THESE YOUTH RETURNED TO THE CUSTODY. TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS DJJ CLOSES. REASON WHY I ASK THIS. IS BECAUSE JUSTIN BUDGET A FEW MINUTES AGO EARLIER TODAY WE HEARD THE BUDGET BILL AND THAT BILL ACTUALLY HAD TWO DATES THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT. THE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE DATE THAT SAYS COUNTIES HAVE TO BE READY AND HAVE- EITHER HAVE BUILT FACILITIES OR ESTABLISH A PLACE FOR THESE. THESE YOU'VE TO GO. AND THEN IT ALSO SAID THAT ON JULY EIGHTH HE'S ME JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR THAT DATE IN JULY TWENTY FIRST HE'S ME JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR THE SECOND DAY WHICH IS THE SAME DATE. THAT THE GUIDELINES WOULD BE ESTABLISHED SOME A LITTLE CONCERNED HOW PEOPLE WOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THE GROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE. AND YOU'D HAVE A PLACE TO GO THAT MEET THE GUIDELINES BUT YET THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE IT READY BY THE TIME THE GUIDELINES ARE ESTABLISHED. ON THE SAME DATE. SO IN TERMS OF- MY ROLE IN DJS FAULT IS ONE WE WILL WE NEED TO BE AND I'M COMMITTED TO BEING AN ACTIVE PARTNER AND BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION AND DATA- SHEREEN AROUND. OUR PROGRAMMING ANY QUESTIONS THAT COME UP I'M I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THIS WITH- BOTH WITH. THE CAR- AS A PART OF THE- OFFICE OF YOU THINK HOW MANY RESTORATION HELPFUL FOR COUNSEL- THAT BORDER STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY AT THERE'S ALSO A COUNCIL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UNIT TOOL KITS FOR THIS SO WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS- AND- AGAIN BEING ABLE TO BEAT WHATEVER RESOURCE WE HAVE WE CAN PROVIDE WE CAN GIVE- BE A PART OF ANY CONVERSATIONS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. TO HELP MAKE THIS REALIGNMENT SUCCESSFUL- IT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT ULTIMATELY THOSE ARE LOCAL DECISIONS THAT WILL BE MADE IN TERMS OF THE DETAILS OF HOW THIS WORKS BOB BUT OUR ROLE IS BECAUSE YOU GET TO BE A ACTIVE PARTNER IN DOING WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP MAKE SURE. THAT CAN HAPPEN ANY. I AM THANK YOU YOU MUCH- I AM NEXT QUESTION I HAVE REGARDING. DATA YOU KNOW M. HOW DO YOU VIEW THE REESE'S IT RECIDIVISM DATA IN RESPECT TO- INTEGRATED BEHAVIOR TREATMENT MODELS AND- I GUESS IT'S BEEN ROLLED OUT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I WANT TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS- A BELIEVE THAT RECIDIVISM RATES ARE BETTER. AND REFLECT BETTER OUTCOMES NOW BECAUSE OF THAT ROLL OUT- I THINK I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION I HAVE- ONE THING I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE WITH RECIDIVISM DATA IS ALWAYS THAT. YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW A COURT FOR NUMBER OF YEARS USUALLY FIVE YEARS TO THEN BE ABLE TO LOOK AT. THOSE RECIDIVISM RATES AND SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD A DJ IN TERMS OF THOSE QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE IBM MODEL- AN IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. ARE THAT THE RECIDIVISM OUTCOMES WE- THAT THE LAST REPORT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. IT WAS AT THIRTEEN THE- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. TO FOURTEEN I'M SORRY YOU THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN CO COURT AND SO EVEN THAT COHORT WAS NOT YET A COHORT THAT HAD GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE COMPONENTS AT THE END OF THE IV TìM. SO WITNESS RECIDIVISM DATA THIS PARTICULAR YEAR- IT WAS YOU KNOW- SAID THREE YEAR CONVICTION RATE WAS. AROUND 50% THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WE WANT BETTER THAN THAT- AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD DONE- ROUND I BELIEVE IT WAS. THAT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MAYBE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN IS- ALSO WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF IRVINE. YOU NOT ONLY LOOK AT HOW WELL THE BABY TìM IS WORKING IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISM RATES BUT CAN WE LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OF RECIDIVISM PERCENTAGE DOESN'T TELL ME IS FOR THOSE THAT RECENT EVADED. WHY WAS THERE A COMMON REASON WHAT PROGRAMMING THAT THEY RECEIVE WHAT RISK LEVELS THAT THEY HAVE DID WE HELP DECREASE THOSE RISKS LEVELS SO WE WERE WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY YEAR IRVINE ON. A MULTI FACETED THAT STUDY TO LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE COMPONENTS AS WELL SO THEIR INITIAL ONE WAS TO DO THAT PROGRAM EVALUATION- AND THAT WAS- PUBLISHED IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY- STATE THAT RECOGNIZE THAT IT APPEARED THAT THE IV TìM WAS. AN EVIDENCE BASED MODEL- BEAR WITH THE USED AS THAT THEY HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT THE STAFF BELIEVED IN THE MODEL THE VIEWS STATED THAT THEY FELT THEY WERE GETTING THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY NEEDED AT ALL DIFFERENT SERVICE LEVELS. THERE WERE- SUGGESTIONS THAT THEY MADE FOR NEXT STEPS IN TERMS OF THE FIDELITY AND STAFFING. MAKING SURE STAFFING VACANCIES RUBBER. PART OF THAT BUT- I THINK THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT COMPONENTS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PURSUE. AND VALUE. THE WHETHER A PROGRAM ON A LIST. THANK THAT'S VERY GOOD- I JUST CAN I CLARIFY ON THE NUMBERS THAT YOU GAVE ME YOU HAD A FIFTY PERCENT- RECIDIVISM RATE WAS NOT ON THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN NUMBERS OR WAS THAT ON THE- FOURTEEN FIFTEEN NUMBER EARTH. ALL FOURTEEN FIFTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN OKAY SO THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN NUMBER SHOULD COME OUT I'M PRETTY SOON- WHEN DOES THAT REPORT EXPECT TO BE RELEASED- I. AM NOT- I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT THAT IS SOMETHING WE COULD BUY COULD FIND OUT FOR YOU. OKAY GREAT STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU LETTING ME ASK THESE QUESTIONS I DO- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF AGAIN. IN THE REAL WORLD I'M A JOB CREATOR RIGHT I THINK A JOB IS THE BEST SOLUTION FOR PROPERTY OR SOMEBODY TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE OR STAFF THE STREETS OR- PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES I MEAN YOU NAME IT THE JOB IS AN ANSWER IN. AN M. IT WAS YEARS AGO BUT WE FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICE IN THE COMMANDER- IN BAKERSFIELD. A LOUDEST USE A CHP OFFICER ONE HOUR A WEEK TO MENTOR- AT RISK YOUTH THAT CAME FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING PROGRAM THAT WE DID- AND THE REASON WHY I BRING IT UP IS BECAUSE THOSE GROUP DOES USE THAT WENT THROUGH IT NOW. PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED GOING TO THE PROGRAM. I WITHOUT THE PARTNERSHIP WITH C. H. P. WOULD BE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES- THAT COMMUNITY AS- THE COMMUNITY THAT COMES FROM THAT TYPE OF AREA AND THAT- ENVIRONMENT. AND BEING IN PRISON DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF- OR THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND A LOT OF POSITIVE INTERTEK INTERACT AND WITH THE POLICE OFFICERS. INTO THIS GAVE THE POLICE OFFICERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MENTOR. TEACH YOU KNOW SPEND TIME WITH THEM M. GET TO KNOW THEIR LIFESTYLE AND WHO THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND- AND THEN TO SHOW THESE USE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER OUT THERE THAN WHAT THEY'RE- DOING. ON THE STREET OR GET DOING TO GET INTO IT DO YOU KNOW JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THEN IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS AND I HATED TO SEE THAT PROGRAM GO AWAY- BUT IT DID- AND IONLY BRING IT UP BECAUSE IT WAS JUST YESTERDAY THAT I GOT A TEXT MESSAGE FROM AN INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS SHARING WITH ME THAT HE'S MARRIED NOW AND HAVING A BABY. AND HE WAS ONE OF THE ONES THAT WE WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THAT WAS GOING TO RESET YOU KNOW. GO BACK TO YOU. THAT AND HE'S- DOING VERY VERY WELL SO IT JUST MADE ME THINK THAT IT'S JUST IRONIC THAT YOUR CONFIRMATION OR IS IT TODAY AND- I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT PROGRAM AND I KNOW YOU PROBABLY WANT AROUND WHEN THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BUT- I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK TO PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. BECAUSE THE KIDS LEARNED A LOT. I MEAN WE SEE. ONE HOPE TO LESSER WAS CONSTRUCTION. BUILDER A BUILDER OF HOMES AND- AND THEN. YOU KNOW YOU JUST THINK THAT WHEN YOU WORK WITH. WILL PEOPLE KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN AND HE SAID THE KID IS GOING TO BE THAT IMPACT WRENCH. IN THE KID WENT TO THE TRACK FOR LIKE TEN MINUTES IN THE SPEECH PAVE SIR GOT A LITTLE FRUSTRATED WHATEVER GOES WHAT'S MATTER. AND THE KID IS FRANTICALLY. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN GOOGLE WHAT IMPACT WRENCHES RIGHT AND FIND IT WITH ALL THE TOOLS IN THE BACK. AND THEN THE OFFICERS TOOK IT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME EXPLAINED ALL THAT PROCESS AND WHAT THESE WORDS AND THEY KIND OF DID A QUIZ TEST NAY. DID SOME DRAWINGS ON WHERE THE TOOLS ARE STORED IN SO. AND THAT'S THAT YOUNG MAN IS NOW LEAD MECHANIC FOR ONE OF THE OIL FIELD SERVICE SUPPORTERS COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE IN KERN COUNTY SO. I THINK IT WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND- I THINK THAT WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS LIKE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE YOUTH DON'T RE OFFEND. THEY DON'T GO BACK TO THE- SAME PLACE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE THAT. AND IF THEY DO GO BACK THEN THEIRSTAND THEY STRONG STAND ENOUGH THIS STRONG. SENSE WRONGNESS. TO AND SAY I'M TEASING A NEW PATH NOW SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU FOR MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH SENATOR COME LONGER THANK YOU AT MADAME PRO TEM IT'S GOOD. TO SEE YOU AGAIN AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVE ME SOME OF YOUR TIME. OF OTHER DAY TO MEET WITH YOU- AND TO TALK WITH YOU AND TO LEARN MORE ABOUT YOUR HISTORY- MY COLLEAGUES ASKED MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED YOU WHEN WE TALKED I THINK IT'S AMAZING THAT SOMEONE IS GETTING APPOINTED TO ESSENTIALLY CLOSE OUT THEIR JOB. BUT MORE POWER TO YOU AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE AN EXCELLENT SELECTION- IN YOU FOR THIS APPOINTMENT I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT- BUT I THINK THAT THEY'RE REALLY IMPORTANT AND JUST WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY ON THE RECORD TO SHARE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING. AND YOUR THOUGHTS WE KNOW THAT- DJ J. HAS INVESTED IN THE GIRLS UNIT WE KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN DJJ OUR YOUNG GIRLS AND THEY'RE ALSO YOUNG MOTHERS- AND WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE SORT OF ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK THAT NUMBER IS- AND- HOW ARE THESE YOUNG MOTHERS AND I GUESS YOUNG FATHERS TO. BUT HOW ARE THE YOUNG MOTHERS REALLY ACCOMMODATED- IN DJJ I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KIND OF SEE THEM AS YOU NO FULL- BEANS AND- IN SOME INSTANCES WITH ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT- BECAUSE MANY OF US MIGHT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT WHAT DO YOU SAY IS RIGHT NOW THE END UP THERE SO. WOULD LOVE TO HEAR- YOUR- RESPONSE- TO HOW DO YOU JJ'S ACCOMMODATING ARE YOUNG MOTHERS. SURE SO- IN IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION AROUND AROUND THE NUMBERS WE DON'T HAVE A DATABASE THAT TRACKS- THE NUMBERS AROUND HOW MANY OF OUR YOUTH THEIR PARENTS BUT- IMPORTANT PIECE IS THAT THAT WOULD BE IDENTIFIED AS A PART OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT PLANS. IN TERMS OF ANYTHING THAT THEY NEEDED TO WORK ON- WITH NOT ONLY THAT FAMILY DYNAMIC BUT SUPPORT AND- HOW DO YOU THINK THROUGH PARENTING SKILLS- YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU. ANY FEARS THAT ARE THAT ARE YOU HAVE ALL OF THOSE THINGS WOULD BE IDENTIFIED IN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT PLAN- FOR OUR OUR OUR YOUNG WOMEN- YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD WANT ME TO GET A STEP BACK AND SAY- WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK- OUR STAFF BUT THEN HER ARE FANTASTIC AND WORKING WITH OUR GIRLS. AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING GENDER RESPONSIVE- RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF NEEDING TO FOCUS ON TRAUMA AND RELATIONSHIPS AND HISTORY OF HELPING YOU- THANKS FOR ALL OF THOSE I PREFERENCE THAT YOUR QUESTION WITH THAT BECAUSE ALL OF THAT ALSO FEEDS INTO- MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE GOT FAMILY CONNECTIONS THAT OUR USERS ARE CONNECTED TO THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY. THIS PASTOR KOBE DID WAS A CHALLENGE TERMS OF FACE TO FACE VISITS BUT VIRTUAL THEN THAT'S AND BEING ABLE TO STAY CONNECTED TO YOU- THEIR CHILDREN WHO THEIR- HE'S TAKING CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN AND SO THAT ARE ALL IN EACH SITUATION IS UNIQUE SO I GO BACK TO THAT INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT PLAN IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH EACH OF OUR PARENTS ON- YOU KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS WHAT THE PLANS ARE AS THEY GO BACK TO YOU- HAD TOWARDS. REENTRY AND DISCHARGE- ARE THEY GOING BACK TO BE AN ACTIVE PARENT IS IT GOING TO BE A COLLABORATIVE AND HOW DO YOU WORK THROUGH THOSE THINGS SO I WOULDN'T I WOULD SAY OVERALL THAT'S HOW WE ADDRESS IT IS REALLY TAKING A LOOK AT EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND HOW DO WE BEST SUPPORT ARE YOU. IN BECOMING STRONG PARENTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I WE ALSO TO ABOUT- THE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR TREATMENT PROGRAM- THAT- IS OPERATED THERE AND- YOU KNOW I HAVE SUCH CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ARMED- AT PRISON PIPELINE I HAVE HUGE CONCERNS ABOUT- ARE OF A SEX REGISTRY AND THE EASE WITH WHICH WE LIKE TO LABEL FOLK SEXUAL OFFENDERS IN THE STATE MOM THAT'S- REALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THEM AND- I ALSO FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT A GOOD NUMBER OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE ALSO BEEN VICTIMIZED OFTENTIMES VICTIMIZED- DURING THEIR YOUTH- SEXUALLY VICTIMIZED. WHICH LEADS TO SOME OF THE- BEHAVIOR THAT THEY END UP- BEING INVOLVED IN AND- YOU KNOW ACTIVATING AND SO- WOULD LOVE TO SORT OF HAVE YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THERE THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR- WHO MIGHT BE LABELED- SEX OFFENDERS AND- THE WORK THAT IS HAPPENING WITH THAT. THAT ON THE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR TREATMENT- BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- AS WE TALK ABOUT REHABILITATION AS WE TALK ABOUT SORT OF RE ENTRY AS WE TALK ABOUT THE HEALING- BUT ALSO AS WE TALK ABOUT LIKE DE STIGMATIZING AND CREATING DIFFERENT PATHWAYS- FOR FOLKS TO BE- RECEIVED AND VIEWED- THIS IS IT'S SOMETHINGTHAT'S VERY HARD TO- HI- NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT HAS LIFE LONG IMPLICATIONS- AND- I. SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT BUT WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO SHARE. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- THAT PROGRAM AND HOW THAT'S BEEN AFFECTED FOR THE YOUNG FOLKS. ABSOLUTELY AND THIS IS. A PROGRAM THAT'S VERY VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART- I WORKED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS- ALONG WITH OUR STAFF TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE TREATMENT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE TO THIS POPULATION- I FIRST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND I THINK IT'S- ALSO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE OF THEM. WHAT WAS THAT AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR AND THAT- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AND DIFFICULT TOPIC- TO DISCUSS BECAUSE IT DOES TRIGGER A LOT OF DIFFERENT EMOTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS. AND SO I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WHEN WE'RE DISCUSSING THE TREATMENT THAT THE ISSUE FOR ME THAT- IT AND OF YOU TO HAVE IT WITH SEXUAL ABUSE OF BEHAVIOR- IT'S NOT INTENDEDTO MINIMIZE THE HARM EXPERIENCED BY THE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ABUSE. AND THESE CRIMES AS WELL AS YOU KNOW THE BEHAVIORS THAT OCCURRED SO- I JUST NEEDED TO SAY THAT FROM THE BEGINNING- WHEN WE DEVELOPED A SEXUAL BEHAVIOR TREATMENT PROGRAM AND THIS WAS- WE IMPLEMENTED THE NEW CURRICULUM IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SO I I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT I WANTED KNOWLEDGE TO YOU AS A- IN A FIELD WE'VE COME A LONG WAY FROM WHEN I FIRST STARTED. RESEARCHING THIS AND LOOKING AT YOU YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR EACH YEAR. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JUVENILES WHO HAVE- WITH SEXUALLY ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR IS THAT THEY ARE NOT- THEY NEED TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RISKS- THAT YOUR ADULT OFFENDERS DO THEIR DIFFERENT RISKS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR SEXUAL OFFENSES IS LOW FOR THIS POPULATION SO- FOR YEARS THE FIELD HAS- THAT. REVAMPS I'VE FOUND THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND RESEARCH BOTH THEM THROUGH SINGLE RESEARCH AS WELL AS MATT AND ALICE'S THAT TYPICALLY THIS POPULATION WILL RE OFFENSE ACTUALLY AROUND SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT. AND IN YOUR RESEARCH IS EVEN SAYING WITH TREATMENT IT'S PRETTY SOUND TO SAY 5% SO WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THESE ARTS LIFELONG BEHAVIORS THESE ARE TREATABLE THE ACRES AND IT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF THEIR ADOLESCENCE THEIR GROWING THEY'RE CHANGING. AND SO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS WHAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO WITH THIS POPULATION IS MAKE SURE YOU'RE TARGETING THE RIGHT TREATMENT. BECAUSE. ONE THERE IS SUCCESS AND THEN YOU'RE ALSO HELPING THE END OF THE UNDER WHAT WILL TO THE- EIGHT YEARS. STAND THERE THINKING AND WHAT LED THEM TO THOSE OFFENSES RECOGNIZING THAT CONVERSATIONS AROUND HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND HEALTHY SEXUALITY IS HUGE. AND I EVEN WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT I THINK THAT CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT. NOT ONLY FOR THE POPULATION WHO IS COMING TO OUR SEXUAL BEHAVIOR TREATMENT PROGRAM BUT FOR ADOLESCENTS IN GENERAL SOCIAL MEDIA ACCESS TO INTERNET PORN. HAS ALTERED. KIND OF HOW CELEBRATE THESE YOUNGER GENERATIONS ARE THINKING ABOUT.
