OF THIS CRISIS. HELP NEXT GOING TO THE NECK QUESTION- THAT TALK ABOUT FLEXIBLE AND STABILISED BECAUSE- FOR THE CURRENT TIME HERE. AND SO THE ADMIN. CONTINUES TO MONITOR AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS ON FLEXIBILITY AND STABILIZATION POLICIES FROM THE CURRENT YEAR. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATOR AND WE AT IN REGARDS TO THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION. SO THE NEXT QUESTION SPEAKS IN REGARDS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PATTERNS THAT PERMANENT CLOSURES THAT THE STATE SHOULD ADDRESS AND I'M GOING TO TRADE OVER TO KAREN TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO PASS. EIGHT ZERO. THE TRENDS IN CONTACTS THAT THE PREVIOUS YEAR OUR THAT WE HAD AN AVERAGE OF FORTY THREE HUNDRED FACILITIES WITH THE CAPACITY TO SERVE SIXTY NINE THOUSAND CHILDREN NEWLY ADDED CHILDREN AN AVERAGE OF FORTY FIVE HUNDRED FACILITIES WITH THAT CASSIDY TO THERAPY SIXTY SIX THOUSAND CHILDREN PERMANENTLY CLOSED AND BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN OVER ON THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES INCREASED BY EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FACILITIES. AND THE TOTAL CAPACITY BY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND SLOTS SO THIS WOULD BE RIGHT BEFORE WE'RE HEADING INTO THE PANDEMIC. BETWEEN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THERE WAS A SLIGHT DECREASE POINT 7% IN THE NUMBER OF TOTAL LENGTH AND FACILITIES 240-200-0800 WHICH IS PASSED THAT BY S. LIKE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE SLOTS WHICH WAS AFTER FIVE POINT SLACKS WITHIN OUR LICENSE CHILD CARE STRUCTURE. HOWEVER AS A RESULT OF THIS PANDEMIC AND NUMBER OF CHILD CARE LICENSE FACILITIES HAVE EXPERIENCE PERIODIC TEMPORARY CLOSURES. AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE NUMBER OF OPEN AND OPERATING FACILITIES WAS CLOSER TO THIRTY SIX HOURS THAN. WHAT THE CAPACITY TO SERVE NEARLY NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN. THE TEMPORARY CLOSURES HAVE AFFECTED STATEWIDE CAPACITY BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR YET. HOW MANY WILL REMAIN PERMANENTLY CLOSE THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY USING SELF REPORTED DATA AT A POINT IN TIME WHICH MAKES DATA ACCURACY MORE DIFFICULT. THE COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION RECENTLY BEGAN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY OF THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE DATA. AND IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE BEGAN REACHING OUT TO THESE FACILITIES AND ASKING ABOUT THEIR CURRENT OPERATIONAL STATUS IDENTIFYING PRIMARY REASONS FOR CONTINUED CLOSURE IDENTIFYING THE LICENSEES NEXT STEPS. I AM SEEING THEIR TECHNO AS THE- CONNECTION TO RESOURCES THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN PROVIDE TO HELP FACILITIES WE OPEN. THE SURVEY RESULTS ARE EXPECTED IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IN ADDITION TO THAT EFFORT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED OUR WAIVER TO HELP INCREASE LICENSE CAPACITY DURING THE PANDEMIC. CDS ASSET SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED A POP UP WEAKER PER PROGRAM TO HELP THE LICENSED CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. TEMPORARILY EXPAND THEIR CAPACITY AND TO ALLOW UNLICENSED CHILD CARE FACILITIES TO OPEN TEMPORARILY. THIS RESULTED IN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL LICENSED CHILD CARE SLOTS. THIS CONTINUES TO BE AN OPERATION TODAY BUT SINCE ITS INCEPTION EIGHTEEN POP UP. CENTERS HAVE BECOME LICENSE. FREE TRIAL CARE PROPER IN THE CHILD CARE HOMES BECOME LICENSE AND I WONDERED IF FIFTY NINE LICENSE CARE PROVIDERS EXPANDED THEIR CAPACITY THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GOING TO HAND IT BACK TO THE DOCTOR HI MY NAME MIKE LEAVITT. THANK YOU THIS CONCLUDES OUR RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE EXTENT THAT WERE OPEN TO ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU WELCOME BACK TO YOU WE HAVE A PANEL NOW- SOME. SOME FOLKS FROM THE FILD. TO TALK ABOUT- EARLY ED. IN THIS RECOVERY SO REMIND- THAT WE'RE GIVING EACH PANELIST NO MORE THAN THREE MINUTES- WE HAVE A LOT TO GET THROUGH- SO WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH THE REPRESENTED FROM CRYSTAL STAIRS AND MEMBERS- THIS IS JUST LIKE WE DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL STAIRS IN THE EASY COALITION I WANT TO START OFF BY REFLECTING ON THE CRISIS IN THE CHILDCARE INDUSTRY AND HOW THE PANDEMIC SEVERELY IMPACT. BILL BEFORE I BEGIN I BUT I'M NOT I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO ELEVATE HOUSE CENTRAL RATE INCREASES ARE TO THIS CONVERSATION PER CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. HOW DIRE THE NEED FOR SUPPLIES ARE AS WELL THIS IS REALLY ADDRESSED THE LACK OF FUNDING AND- LACK OF ACCESSIBILITY AND CHILDCARE SHE PROVIDE. WHEN WE- GOT IT HOWEVER IT WAS OFTEN VERY DELAY IN THAT THIS WAS A SPECIAL TRUE MORE. IN THE OLD RECALL WADE WITH THE LACK OF OUR PREPARATION SUPPLIES FOR TESTING HIGH QUALITY. WE'VE HEARD THE ENDEMIC FROM MANY PROVIDE. IN THE CREW C. R. THERE AREA THAT THEY HAVE OFTEN. NOT HAD. THE PERSON CHECK EQUIPMENT YES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES OR THEIR CHILDREN FAMILIES THEY SERVE. AS A RESULT MANY HAVE HAD CLOSED- SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED CAPACITY CRYSTAL'S THEIR AT- IN THE COMMUNITY. IN HOME TESTING KITS AND KEEP THE SUPPLY ROUTE ENDEMIC MOST RECENTLY WHEN THE OVERCOME BARRIERS RAN RAMPANT IN OUR COMMUNITIES MANY PROVIDERS GAVE TESTIMONY THAT IF THEY DID NOT RECEIVE THE RESOURCES WE WERE ABLE TO QUICKLY PIVOT INDUSTRY OUT TO THEM. MANY OF THEM WOULD HAVE THE CLOTHES IN BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PREPARED AND LET'S NOT FORGET BACK DECEMBER WHEN THERE WAS A NATION WIDE LACK OF ACCESSIBILITY TESTING KITS HOWEVER OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WERE EXPECTED TO KEEP PROPER OPERATING IT DID NOT HAVE THE ACCESSIBILITY TO THESE RESOURCE. SO THE LAST HOUR WE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT BE REACTIVE FUNDING FOR PROVIDING ACCESSIBILITY TO THE FIVE PROVIDERS. WE MUST BE PROACTIVE WITH THING SO THIS MANAGE. GIVE ME BACK REMAIN THAT THE PANDEMIC IS NOT A- ONLY NINETEEN. TO DISPLAY. IMPACT COMMUNITIES UP. INCLUDING ARE A PEOPLE. WHILE SOME BUYERS ARE ABLE TO REMAIN OPEN OTHERS.

IT'S BEEN A REALLY REALLY CHALLENGING TWO YEARS AND THREE MINUTES IS DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH BUT I WILL DO MY BEST I JUST WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE ENTIRE FIELD OF EARLY EDUCATION AND CHILD CARE WORKERS. IF COME TO WORK EVERY DAY SINCE MARCH SIXTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY THE FIRST DAY THAT THIS HORRIFIC PANDEMIC SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING ELSE. SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY MY TEAM HAS BEEN TAKING CALLS AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND DAY INCLUDING WEEKENDS FOR PARENTS WHO CALL AND SAY THEIR CHILD TESTED POSITIVE FOR OR FROM PARENTS THAT COLIN SAY THEY ARE A CLOSE CONTACT INFORMATION PLOYS WHO DON'T HAVE CHILD CARE BECAUSE THEIR CHILD CARE. CENTER CLOSE OR FROM EMPLOYEES WHO TESTED POSITIVE OR BECAUSE THEIR OWN CHILDREN TESTED POSITIVE SO I JUST REALLY WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO MY TEAM FOR TAKING THIS CALLS AND THEN DOING THE CONTACT TRACING. TO DETERMINE WHICH SCHOOLS HAVE TO PIVOT TO DEARTH DISTANCE LEARNING. AND FOR HOW LONG AND HOW TRAGIC IT IS AND ALWAYS THE FIRST QUESTION IS ARE THE CHILDREN OKAY AND IS THE TEAM OKAY. OUR WORK FOR CITY AT EDS IS MADE UP OF TWO HUNDRED AMAZING AND DEDICATED HUMANS THEY LEAVE THEIR HOME EVERY DAY TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE TO DO THE RIGHT THING THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION MUST RECOGNIZE THEM THANK THEM AND SUPPORT THEM WITH A PROFESSIONAL WAIT. FOR FORTY THREE YEARS EDS HAS BEEN SERVING OUR COMMUNITY IN TWENTY TWO EARLY EDUCATION CENTERS WE SERVE THIRTEEN HUNDRED ESSENTIAL WORKER FAMILIES THEIR INFANTS TODDLERS THREE YEAR OLD AND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN PRESCHOOL. WE ARE HIGHLY REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- MANDATE ARE RESEARCH BASED CURRICULUM. THE STUDENT TEACHER RATIOS AND TEACHER QUALIFICATIONS IN ADDITION TO THE QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES RECEIVED WE ALSO PROVIDE CHILD CARE THE CHILD CARE PORTION OF OUR PROGRAM SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL WORKER FAMILIES. ARE FAMILIES WORK IT LOOKS THEY WORK IN THE HOSPITALS THEY WORK AT IT NOW SO LONG AND THE GROCERY STORE THERE YOUR DOCTOR IN YOUR NURSE. I PERSONALLY RESPECT AND SUPPORT THESE REGULATIONS IN OUR TITLE FIVE PROGRAMS I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS IF I HAD NOT. IMAGINED TESTIFYING LIKE THIS FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS. COMING TO SACRAMENTO AND SPEAKING HERE AS BEEN MOST. OVER THE- WHAT I HEARD AND WHAT I HEAR IT YEAR. IT IS THAT THERE IS NO MONEY WE RESPECT WHAT YOU DO AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING. THANK YOU FOR BEING OPEN TO SERVE THE FAMILIES DURING COLD FOOD WHEN DISTRICTS WERE CLOSED. AND IMAGINE HOW THE TEACHERS IN MY PROGRAM FELT WHEN OUR OWN GOVERNOR CAME TO VISIT AND DISCUSSED WITH THEM HOW HE THOUGHT THEY NEEDED A PROFESSIONAL WEIGHTS BECAUSE THEY ARE EDUCATING AND CARING. FOR THE YOUNGEST LEARNERS IN OUR STATE AND YES THIS INCLUDES FOUR YEAR OLD. NOW IMAGINE ALL THIS AND HAD BEEN HAVING A BUDGET ALL OF A SUDDEN HAS MILLION TO MILLION DOLLARS OF DOLLARS FOR THOSE SAME FOUR YEAR OLDS. BUT ONLY A PAIR SERPENTI K. AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO RECRUIT STAFF AND TO PLAN BUT ONLY FOR TWO K. TEACHERS. FOR THEM TO PLAN WITH US BUT NO NEW DOLLARS FOR US TO PLAN WITH THAT MONEY CAME FROM AND WHY THE IN EQUITIES ON WHERE IT IS ALLOCATED. OUR STATE DID DETERMINE THAT T. K. PROGRAMS FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLD SHOULD BE SERVED AT A CERTAIN RATE I PROPOSE. TITLE GRAMS THAT SERVE THE SAME FOUR YEAR OLD. BE FUNDED AT THE SAME BASE RATE. AND THEN ON TOP OF THIS BASE RATE TITLE FIVE PROGRAM SHOULD RECEIVE AN ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. A FACTOR BECAUSE WE HAVE LOWER TEACHERS- TO STUDENT RATIOS. THEN THE T. K. PROGRAMS. UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPOSED BUDGET DOES NOT REFLECT THE NEED OF EVERYTHING I JUST SAID NO NEW FUNDING IS PROPOSED TO SUPPORT OUR PROFESSIONAL WORKFORCE. YOU KNOW THE HOLD HARMLESS FOR CONTRACTORS. WHICH IS HOW WE ARE KEEPING THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM OPEN FOR SESSION WORK ESSENTIAL WORKERS. THIS BEING ABSENT IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS NOW CAUSING PROVIDERS TO PLAN FOR SHUT DOWN ON JULY FIRST WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. CONTINUING TO SERVE THE VULNERABLE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BEG FOR THIS AND IT SHOULD IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET. IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY ALONE WE HAD TWO HUNDRED POSITIVE CASES. THAT'S FROM FOUR NOVEMBER. TWO HUNDRED TIMES WE HAD TO CONTACT PARENTS ABOUT STAFF CLOSURES DISTANCE LEARNING. AND THEN RE OPEN. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE HOME HARMLESS WILL BE CLOSED FOR GOOD. RATE INCREASES ARE ALSO MISSING WE ALREADY HAVE A PROFESSIONAL WORK FORCE FOR WORKFORCE TEN USED TO SUBSIDIZE THESE PROGRAMS. BY ACCEPTING LOWER WAGES. UTK PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR TEACHER TEEKAY TEACHERS TO EARN PROFESSIONAL WAGES AND BENEFITS IT DOES NOT LOOK AT THE LEAGUE NEEDLE. FOR NON ELLIE A COMMUNITY EARLY EDUCATION EDUCATORS SALARY PARITY IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING GAPS IN PAY AND OPPORTUNITY. WE ALSO MUST CONTINUE TO WAIVE THE FAMILY FEES IF WE TRULY ARE TO HAPPEN EQUITABLE SYSTEM. I VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY. THE GUIDING QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN THE SAME FOR YEARS WE KNOW THE ANSWER CARRENTALS CHOICE HAPPENS WHEN FAMILIES. OPTIONS IN A MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IS FULLY FUNDED SO PROVIDERS CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS AND PAY PROFESSIONAL WAGES. NOT POVERTY WAGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST A REMINDER WE HAVE- QUITE A FEW PANELISTS WE WANNA HEAR EVERYBODY TODAY SO PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THREE MINUTES OR LESS. GIRLS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO STOP AND MOVE ON. AT NEXT SPEAKER. HIS FROM PARENT VOICES MARIN. HELLO MY NAME IS CAITLYN HUDSON AND I LIVE IN NEVADA I HAVE A SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND A ONE YEAR OLD SON- I'M PART OF. OUR VOICES AROUND COUNTY. WHEN I WAS TOLD I DID NOT HAVE TO PAY MY FAMILY THING UNTIL JULY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO I WAS SO THRILLED AND WAS ABLE TO ROLL MYSELF INTO THE SPRING SEMESTER COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH IS SOMETHING I HAVE DREAMED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME. FREEZING FAMILY FEES ALLOWED ME TO DREAM BIG FAN YOU'RE PURSUING MY DREAM OF GETTING MY DEGREE. IT WAS GREAT NO I KIND OF JUST A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY EACH MONTH TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA COST OF SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND TRANSPORTATION TO CLASS. I ALSO RUN MY DAUGHTER TO GYMNASTICS SHE HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO JOIN BUT THE COST HAS ALWAYS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR US TO REPORT. I LOVE WATCHING HER TUMBLE AND BE A PART OF THE TEAM. AS A PARENT THESE ARE THE MOMENTS WE HOPE FOR AND HOW WE DREAM ABOUT PROVIDING FOR OUR KIDS. LET ME SHARE WITH YOU WHAT MY BUDGET LOOKS LIKE EVERY MONTH SO YOU CAN BEGIN TO UNDERSTANDJUST WHY KEEPING THE FAMILY FREEZE. THE FAMILY FEES FROZEN IS ESSENTIAL FOR MY FAMILY. I WORK AS A BANK TELLER AND BRING HOME ABOUT THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED A MONTH. MY RENT IS TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED WHICH IS EATING UP OVER TWO THIRDS OF MY PAYCHECK. BETWEEN GAS AND ELECTRIC MY PHONE BILL INTERNET MY CAR PAYMENT AS WELL AS INSURANCE AND- TRANSPORTATION GAS. I HAVE ABOUT FIVE DOLLARS LEFT OVER EVERY MONTH. YOU MEAN NO ROOM FOR ANY EMERGENCIES ARE UNEXPECTED COSTS. I RELY ON HIGH INTEREST CREDIT CARDS THE KEEP THIS MERRY GO ROUND GOING. THE FAMILY FEE WAIVER HAS ALSO ALLOWED ME TO ROLL MY SENATE BILL GATES CHILD CARE. ALTHOUGH IT WAS HARD TO FIND SPACE FOR HIM. HE WAS BORN DURINGCOBIT AND FROM THE DAY HE WAS BORN I'VE HAD HIM ON A WAIT LIST FOR THE ONLY ENTRANCE. CENTER AND RAN COUNTY THAT ACCOMMODATED MY WORK SCHEDULE. I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND CHILD CARE FOR HIM BUT THAT BUT THEY DID NOT OPEN UNTIL EIGHT THIRTY. I HAD TO REDUCE MY WORK HOURS AND THERE'S INCOME IN ORDER TO HAVE ANY CARE AT ALL. MY CHILD CARE CENTER WAS ALSO FAR OUT OF THE WAY AS WELL AND ADDED THIRTY MINUTES MY COMMUTE IN BOTH THE MORNING. AND AFTERNOON. NOT HAVING A SIZEABLE CHILDCARE CLOSE TO HOME IS THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FAMILIES. ESPECIALLY WITH GAS PRICES BEING SO HIGH. IT TAKES TIME AWAY THAT WE COULD BE SPENDING WITH THEIR KIDS AS WELL. ALL THIS ADDS ADDITIONAL STRESS AND DURING THIS TIME I FELT AN IMPACT ON MY MENTAL HEALTH. I CALLED EVERY MONTH FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS HOPING FOR A SPACE OPEN UP FOR MY SON SO WE COULD GO BACK TO A MORE NORMAL ROUTINE. I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO ENROLL MY SON IN THE ENTRANCE CENTER NEAR MY HOME AND MY DAUGHTER'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF BEING ON THE WAIT LIST. HE ACTUALLY JUST STARTED YESTERDAY. BUT I CAN'T GET BACK TO THE HOURS. I SPENT IN THE CAR THE MONEY A LOT TO MAKE THE CHOICE. TO MAKE CHILDCARE WORK AND CAN'T TAKE WITH THE STRESS OF HAVING MORE ON MY PLATE BECAUSE THE LACK OF ACCESS TO CHILDCARE. IF I HAVE TO START PAYING MY THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS AND THE FAKE AND- I WILL HAVE TO DROP BACK TO PART TIME CARE FOR MY SON TAKE MY DAUGHTER. OUT OF GYMNASTICS. AND SCRAMBLE TO HAVE ENOUGH TO PAY FOR THE COSTS OF- STARTING COLLEGE MYSELF. AFTER LAST YEAR'S THE DISTANCE LEARNING I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY THOSE THOSE ABILITY TO MY KIDS. I CAN FEEL MY STRESS LEVEL RISING JUST THINK ABOUT THE FAMILY HE'S COMING BACK. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS NUMBER AS WELL. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT WORKING FAMILIES LIKE MINE WE NEED TO PASS A BUDGET THAT EXTENDS THE FAMILY FEE WAIVER WHICH HAS ALLOWED ME TO PURSUE MY EDUCATIONAL GOALS PROVIDING EXPERIENCES FOR MY DAUGHTER AND WILL MY SON IN FOR DAY CHILD CARE. TWENTY TWO EXPANSION OCCURS WHAT'S REDUCE THE WAIT LIST AND WE NEED TO RAISE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN SUPPORT OF THE PROVIDERS TAKING CONNECTICUT. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER WILL WE'LL HEAR FROM THE REPRESENTED FROM CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME'S YVONNE COTTAGE I AM A CHILD CARE PROVIDER AND MEMBER OF THE CHILDCARE PROVIDER UNION JUNCKER PROVIDERS UNION WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN SEIU LOCAL. NINETY NINE FIVE TWO NINE AND YOU D. W. WE HAVE ALSO A MOM I HAD THREE CHILDREN- OLDEST IS. TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY AND OUR YOUNGEST IS FIFTEEN GOING ON THE GRANDCHILDREN AND THEY ALSO ATTEND MY CHILD CARE CENTER HERE WHICH IS A BLESSING I WANTED THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME TESTABLE TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY. I OPENED MY SHOP WITHOUT AN AND THEN PROVIDING CHILD CARE TRAUMA INFORMED OUT CHAIR IN LANCASTER EVER SINCE I CAME INTO THIS FIELD CAN MAKE A POSITIVE CHANGE TO MAKE AN IMPACT A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MY COMMUNITY AND I THOUGHT WHAT BETTER WAY THAN TO OFFER PARENTS A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO LEAVE THEIR CHILD A SAFE PLACE FOR THEIR CHILD WOULD LEARN WHAT BLACK WOULD GROW- I LOVE WHAT I DO. I LOVE IT IT'S A- IT'S A IT'S A- IT'S A MINISTRY. AND EIGHT IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN IT SHOULD BE THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED SO MANY FLAWS IN SO MANY. AND DISCREPANCIES IN THE FIELD- WITH SCHOOLS BEING CLOSED ESSENTIAL WORKERS- HAD TO LEAVE THEIR KIDS IN CHILD CARE AND WHILE MANY ARE PERFORMING THESE LIFESAVING LIFESAVING WORK. THUS FAR THE CHILD CARE COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO STEP UP WE'VE HAD TO STAY OPEN WE'VE HAD TO MAKE CHANGES WE'VE HAD YOU RISK EXPOSING OUR FAMILIES TO DAYCARE. I'M DOWN WITH THE FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS NOT HAVING HEALTH CARE. THE RISK THAT WE FACE AS A MAN. AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE DURING THE PANDEMIC TO NOT ONLY PROVIDE CHILD CARE AND ALSO PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING I WENT FROM BEING A PRESCHOOL TEACHER TO BEING AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER. AND ALTHOUGH I TOOK THE CHALLENGE ON IT HAS BEEN IT HAS TAKEN A TOLL ON MY MENTAL HEALTH. IT'S TAKING A TOLL ON MY FINANCES MY EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. I'M AYE YOU'RE LITERALLY EVERY TIME THAT WE HAD. TO I'M- UPDATE OUR FACILITY TO PURCHASE CLEANING SUPPLIES TO PURCHASE INTERNET AYE LAPTOPS EXTRA TAX. WE HAD TO TURN OUR WHOLE DOWNSTAIRS INTO A CLASSROOM. AND THE HOURS ARE GRUELING MY HOURS FROM TEN HOURS TO FOURTEEN HOURS A DAY. AND YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY I CONTINUE TO DO THIS. ARAMBULA I DO IT BECAUSE I HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT EARLY CHILD CARE AND EDUCATION IS MY COLLEAGUES. AND I AND IT GIVES ME A PURPOSE. IT THERE'S BEEN DAYS WHEN I. CONSTANTLY QUESTIONED MYSELF. ON HOW TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT SAME QUALITY. WE'VE THE CHANGE THAT WE'VE HAD DURING THIS PANDEMIC. A LOT OF US PROVIDERS ARE QUESTIONING THE SAME THING. WE ARE RUNNING INTO BERNAU THERE'S THOUSANDS OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE RUNNING IN SUPPORT NOW. WE WAKE UP EVERY DAY WITH THE SAME SMILE TO GIVE THESE KIDS NO MATTER WHAT IS GOING ON. IN THE BACKGROUND. AND DESPITE THE CRUCIAL NATURE OF OUR WORK WE'RE STILL NOT VALUES. AS CHILD CARE WORKERS AND I'M REMINDED OF THAT EVERY DAY. TAKING ON OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN IN OUR HOME AND TO PROVIDE THAT SAFE ENVIRONMENT IS AN ENORMOUS GIFT. AND ALSO WE'RE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE. AND YET WERE AMONG THE NATION'S MOST LOWEST PAID WORKERS. I AM WITH EXTREMELY LIMITED TO ALMOST ZERO TIME ALL OR HEALTH CARE. AND AS WITH EITHER INDUSTRY OR OCCUPATION. IN A LIVING WAGE AND PROVIDING THE NECESSARY ANSWER ESSENTIAL TO ATTRACT AND NOT GET DISTRACTED HAVE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BUT ALSO RETAIN THOSE CHAPTER PROVIDERS. AND THERE'S REALLY NO INCENTIVE AT THIS TIME THERE'S REALLY NO INCENTIVE FOR US. TO CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME MARK. AND TO BE HONEST PASSION AND LOVE WILL ONLY TAKE YOU SO FAR. WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IN YOUR BACK HURTS BECAUSE OF THE REPETITIVE MOVEMENT THAT YOU MAKE FROM BENDING OVER EVERY DAY TO PICK UP CHILDREN. AND YET THERE IS NO LOW HEALTH CARE FOR US TO GO MAKE A DOCTOR'S VISIT LET ALONE EVEN THINK ABOUT RETIREMENT. I'M I TRULY BELIEVE IF WE HAD BENEFITS. I STRUCTURE PROVIDERS WOULD BE IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING EVERY DAY AND THOSE CHALLENGES ARE TRAUMA. CHILDREN HAVING SIDE HE RETURNING BACK TO SCHOOL THEY HAVE PTSD AND WE'RE HAVING TO NAVIGATE THAT. WITHOUT ANY TIME OFF WITHOUT ANY HEALTH CARE. AT LEAST IF WE KNEW WE HAD HEALTH CARE THEY KNEW WE WOULD KNOW WE HAD A SAFETY NET IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENED OR CAME UP. THERE'S MANY FAMILIES ARE SO MANY FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT ARE IN LACK OF JUST BASIC ACCESS TO THE MUCH NEEDED CARE THAT. YOU COULD PROVIDE. AND LACK OF THAT ADEQUATE STATE INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIES WORK. DISTRIBUTION OF IS PART OF THAT PROBLEM. BUT STILL IT'S A LACK OF JUNCTURE PROVIDERS BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET THEM WE CANNOT ATTRACT THEM INTO A FIELD THAT HAS NOTHING TO PROVIDE FOR THEM. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO INVEST IN US BY PROVIDING US WITH THOSE ESSENTIAL NEEDS WITH HEALTHCARE WITH RETIREMENT AND THE ADEQUATE TIME OFF. BY INVESTING IN US YOU'RE ALSO INVESTING IN OUR CHILDREN COULD YOU REALLY DESERVE THE BEST IN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. AND IT WORRIES ME TO THINK THAT LIKE MR BLAKELY MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS AS WE SPEAK THERE ARE PROVIDERS THERE ARE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS LEAVING THE FIELD. AMAZING TEACHERS THAT HAVE GIVEN THE BEST OF THEIR YEARS TO THIS FIELD INTO THIS COMMUNITY THAT ARE WALKING AWAY BECAUSE OF LACK OF BACK THE BASIC HEALTH CARE AND RETIREMENT AND TIME OFF. SO AGAIN I JUST I'M ASKING YOU TODAY TO INVEST IN US. INTO A MESSAGE TO OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE REPRESENTAN FROM SEIU. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'LL JUST DO A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE'RE AT ON THE JAIL AND SEES- THEY REFER TO THAT THREE PRIORITY BENEFITS MENTIONED IN A BONDS TESTIMONY- THAT WE IDENTIFIED AS URGENT THAT'S HEALTHCARE RETIREMENT. AND PAID TIME OFF OUR WORKERS ARE ALREADY RECEIVING LOW RATES DESPITE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE'RE SEEING RATES OF 70% OF THE MARKET RATE FROM FIVE YEARS AGO ON TOP OF THAT. MANY ARE PAYING UP TO TWO THOUSAND A MONTH JUST FOR HEALTH INSURANCE OUR PROVIDERS ARE STRUGGLING TO BALANCE THE RISE EVERYDAY ITEMS SUCH AS DIAPERS FOOD AND RAN IT- WHICH MEANS THAT MANY CAN'T SAVE FOR RETIREMENT TAKE TIME OFF OR EVEN PAY FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE. I THE PRIORITY ITEMS SUCH AS HEALTH CARE WE FOUND THAT MORE THAN 50% OF OUR FAMILY'S HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SURVEYED REPORTED TO LEAD OUR POSTPONED MEDICAL TREATMENT DUE TO LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE ARE BEING UNDER. INSURED 20% REPORT THAT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE UNABLE TO AFFORD THE MOST BASIC PLAN THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. OUR ESTIMATE IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION OVER TWO YEARS WOULD PROVIDE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE PROVIDERS. RETIREMENT MANY OVER 90% THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND IN SAVINGS- FOR RETIREMENT EXPERTS ADVISE THAT RETIREES SHOULD PLAN TO COVER EXPENSE OF FORTY THOUSAND A YEAR TO RETIRE BY AGE SIXTY FIVE. I AM BASED ON THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SAVINGS OF ONE MILLION. OUR CURRENT COST ESTIMATES FOR A SAVINGS FOR PROVIDERS WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION TO ENROLL ELIGIBLE FAMILIES HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. INTO A FOUR FIFTY SEVEN B. RETIREMENT PLAN. FINALLY PAID TIME OFF. A MANY OF OUR PROVIDERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OF THE STATE AND CANNOT TAKE OFF. THE HOLIDAYS OR VACATION TIME THEY DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT PAID TIME OFF FOR SICK LEAVE VACATION EMERGENCIES AND HOLIDAYS. SO THIS CAN BE REALLY TAXING ON A PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THAT WOULD PROVIDE ELIGIBLE PROVIDERS WITH FIVE ADDITIONAL PAID TIME OFF TO EASE. INCLUDING REIMBURSEMENT FOR CHILDREN UNPAYABLE SCHEDULES. CCP YOU IN THE MYSTERY IT HAPPENED. WORKING TO RE AGREE. AND RECOGNITION OF THE URGENT OF THE NEED AND TO GIVE- RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE MEANINGFUL INVESTMENTS IN IMMEDIATE. IDEALLY IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUDGET YEAR I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL- BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE ARE- THE BENEFITS ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASES. INCREASES ARE CRUCIAL TO REVITALIZE THE ARTS HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IN STAFFING TO THE LEVEL OF CALIFORNIANS WORKING FAMILY NEEDS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. OKAY THANK YOU THE LAST SPEAKER THE REPRESENTED FROM THE LOW INCOME INVESTMENT FUND. HI MY NAME IS ANGIE CARLENE AND I'M WITH THE LOW INCOME INVESTMENT FUND WHERE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND- WE ARE I'M HERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF LAUGHFEST STAKEHOLDER OF THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM BUT WANT TO MAKE THE DISCLAIMER THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH CDS LAST. ON THE AND FOR STRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM A PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION WERE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE EASY COALITION AND SUPPORT THEIR PRIORITIES FOR THE SECTOR. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID IN THE PREVIOUS- TIME IS. THAT THE WORK FORCE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY THINK ABOUT IS. THE STATE THAT IS THE PHYSICAL SPACES THAT THOSE PROVIDERS AND- EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS SPEND THEIR TIME AND DOESN'T HAVE GOOD VENTILATION DOESN'T HAVE A NON LEAGUE RUTH. DOES IT HAVE- OTHER IMPORTANT PHYSICALS STRUCTURES TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE GREAT SPACES. AND WE REALLY HAD FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE SUPPLY BUILDING CHALLENGES THE PROVIDERS AND THE SPECTER OF HAD FOR DECADES. AND THE PANDEMIC'S ONLY MADE IT WORSE BOB THERE'S NO FEDERAL STANDALONE FUNDING FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FACILITIES. AND UNTIL RECENTLY A THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY I'M AT THE STATE LEVEL BURKE- GRATEFUL THAT NOW THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. A BEGINNING TO FACILITIES OF FUNDING. THIS WILL REALLY HELP ON THE SUPPLY BUILDING SIDE AND THERE IS A LOT MORE NEEDED- PROVIDERS HAVE REALLY SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS. FILLING IT IN CLASSROOMS BECOMING PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AND EXPECTED NOT TO ALSO BECOME FACILITIES% EXPERTS IS A BIG ASK. FOR ANY OF YOU WHO'VE EXPERIENCED HER OWN HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECT YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE WHAT'S INVOLVED HOW LONG IT TAKES TO FIND TO GET BIDS FROM CONTRACTORS. TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION. GET PERMITS AND WE KNOW THAT THE STATE REALLY WANTS TO PUT NEW SPACES IN CHILD CARE DESERTS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF TUCKER TYPE DESERT'S ACROSS CALIFORNIA. LIFT REALLY BELIEVES THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO BUILD EXPERTISE PARTICULARLY IN AREAS THAT ARE RURAL AND TRIBAL NATIONS AND PLACES WHERE MOST CHILDREN. COULD BE FASTER AND HOME BASED SETTINGS. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THERE WAS A HUGE UNDERINVESTMENT IN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. BOB AS OUR ROLE AS THE CO CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL CHILDREN'S FACILITIES NETWORK WE SPONSORED RESEARCH THAT SHOW TO THAT SHOW THAT IN THE FIVE YEARS LEADING UP TO THE PANDEMIC. FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND BUSINESSES IN THE FIVE MOST POPULOUS STATES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. RECEIVE LOANS FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AND- CDFI IS LIKE LEFT. HOWEVER OF THOSE FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND BUSINESSES ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY OF THOSE WENT TO CHILD CARE. SO THIS SHOWS YOU HOW MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR TO HELP. LEVERAGE PRIVATE DOLLARS AND PUBLIC DOLLARS TO REALLY BUILD SUPPLY. AND IN THE HOUSING SECTOR THEY'VE STARTED pTHEY DO A LOT OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LEVERAGING AND IT'S EXAM IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU CAN USE PRIVATE DOLLARS. TO INCREASE SUPPLY BUILDING AFTER. ADD WE BELIEVE MODELS LIKE THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES FUNDED SAN FRANCISCO. WHICH WAS THE ONLY COUNTY IN THE STATE THAT ACTUALLY INCREASE THEIR SUPPLY BY 20% WHEREAS THE REST OF THE STATE ACTUALLY DECREASED SUPPLY UP BY 14% BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT THEY'VE MADE IN THE WORK FORCE AND IN DISABILITIES. PARTICULARLY WITH HANDS ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS CONTRACTING NEGOTIATING LEASES. SITE EVALUATION ETCETERA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR DEDICATION TO BUILDING BACK IN INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF CHILD CARE. TO MEET THE REAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL NOW GET TO ASK QUESTIONS FROM BOTH THESE PANEL SAID THAT THE SECOND PANEL OF COURSE IS THE FIELD THE FIRST IS MORE. FROM BY THE STATE IN THE L. A. L. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS- WE HEARD THESE ISSUES OVER AND OVER FROM ALL OF THEM. SO THE FIRST IF THE- DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES COULDN'T AND LIGHTNESS MORE ON THE TEMPORARY CLOSURES HANNAH YOU REFERRED TO. THIS TABLE AND OUR AGENDA. AND I KNOW OVER THE YEARS WE'VE HAD ATTRITION- BUT THE NUMBERS ARE. ARE ARE MORE SO DURING THIS- PANDEMIC SO. DO YOU TRIBUTE THE TEMPORARY CLOSURES TO BE. WHAT THEY'RE NOTED HERE IS TEMPORARY- I KNOW WE'RE JUST. YOU KNOW CHANGING RAPIDLY WITH THIS- YOU KNOW AFTERMATH OF COVERED NINETEEN. SO WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE- TEMPORARY CLOSURES ARE HEADED. WE DO SEE THEM AS HIGH THIS IS KAREN CHANG DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WE DO THINK MS TEMPORARY CLOSURES AND MANY OF THESE FACILITIES CLOSE AND OPEN AND SOME OF THE SPEAKERS ON THE PANEL JUST SPOKE ABOUT- BUT POSITIVE AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CLOSING A FACILITY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND IN OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS WILL BE DISCUSSING WITH LICENSEES THERE PLANS TO RE OPEN SOME OF THEM ARE RE OPENED AND SO THEN WE'RE NOTING THAT IN OUR DATA. AND ALSO OFFERING RESTORE SAYS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP ANYONE CLOSE TO RE OPEN BUT YES DEFINITELY SEE THESE AS TEMPORARY CLOSURES NOT PERMANENT STRUCTURES AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT WHAT'S WHAT'S IS YOU KNOW WE'RE COUNTING ON THIS OUR ECONOMY IS COUNTING ON A LOT OF THESE PROVIDERS ARE. HOPING TO GET BACK OPEN WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT THEY ARE TEMPORARY AND THIS IS NOT- YOU KNOW PERMANENT HIT TO OUR ALREADY FRAGILE CHILD CARE INDUSTRY. THEY'RE PART OF THAT IS BASED ON THE RESPONSES WE RECEIVED TEACHER THE SURVEY THAT STARTED IN JANUARY. SO THE EARLY INDICATIONS ARE THAT A LOT OF THESE FACILITIES EITHER ARE WE OPENING OUR HAVE REOPENED. BUT IT'S VERY DYNAMIC AND FLUID AND SO YOU MAY BE RE OPENED FORMALLY CONTOURING JANUARY YOU MAY HAVE HAD AN OUTBREAK LATER IN JANUARY AND CLOSED. AND THEN NEEDED TO RE OPEN AND SELL. IT THAT COMPONENT I BILLS EARLY INDICATORS FROM THE SURVEY AND THEN ALSO IN A TOTAL INFORMATION FROM THE FIELD. OKAY. THANK YOU CAN I ASK THE REPRESENTED THROUGH CRYSTAL STAIRS WHO- OF COURSE IS A MAJOR- PROVIDER OF CHILD CARE IN THE- L. AREA. TO GIVE YOUR INSIGHT ON ON THE RATE REFORM WE HAVE I JUST INCOME UP JUSTIN BLAKELY. CBSA COUPLE WORDS US AND WE CAN SEE SEE YOU BACK HERE ONLINE. IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON THE- THE RATE REFORM THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH LAST YEAR AND- ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WASN'T- QUITE A FINISHING THE JOB IN OUR PERSPECTIVE. SO HOW IS THAT PLAYING OUT AS FAR AS- INCREASES TO PAY LIVING WAGES AND KEEP THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THEIR CENTERS AND WHAT MORE IN ANY IN OUR PERSPECTIVE NEEDS TO NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO COMPLETE THE TASK. YEAH THANK YOU- I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- YOU KNOW LAST YEAR'S CHILDCARE RATE INCREASE GOT PROVIDERS UP TO THAT SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE. ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY IN A PRE TEND TO MAKE LIFE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THOSE FUNDING LEVELS WITH A CAT. THE NORMAL RISE OF INFLATION IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY WHILE WE ARE YOU KNOW GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT OUR RATE INCREASE. AT THE LEGISLATURE UP ALL OP WORK DEPENDING DEMOCRATS FOR THE NEW REALITY UP ON US- THAT THE LAST YEAR'S RATE INCREASE IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH- JUST TO KIND OF. HIGHLIGHT SOME SPECIFIC POINTS THE WHATEVER REFERRING TO I THINK THAT NEEDS TO PARMAR SURVEY THE MINIMUM THE MINIMUM WAGE HAS INCREASE. OR DOLLARS WITH THE LAST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION TAKING EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR SMALLER PROVIDERS. SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN INFLATION HAS INCREASED BY 11% WITH A 7% INCREASE OF ONLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FINALLY FINALLY EARLY DATA FROM JANUARY INDICATES THAT THE NATIONAL LABOR CRISIS IS FINALLY HIT THE CHILD CARE PROFESSION- SO ESSENTIALLY- THERE THAN INFLATION. AND THE- THE LACK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THE CURRENT TIMES OF WHERE WE ARE WITH THE COST OF LIVING IS SEVERELY. ACTING UP PROVIDERS WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO. YOU KNOW. CONTINUE TO- RETIRED THE- FAR. RESTRUCTURE. OKAY THANK YOU COULD CAN WE ARE THAT CAN BE ROSEN FROM TO TALK ABOUT- YOUR PURSE ON RATE WE'VE IN AN- WHERE WE'VE GOT WHAT LAST YEAR AND HOW MAY MORE IN DO. YES ABSOLUTELY SO I THINK OF THE MOST RECENT SURVEY IS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS BUT- WE HAVE SEEN INFLATION INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. I'M TO THE POINT WHERE MANY OF OUR PROVIDERS ARE UNABLE TO EXPAND FOR NEW KIDS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THE RATE INCREASE BALL WILL SUBSTANTIATE WHAT THEY NEED- TO ABSORB THE COST ESPECIALLY WITH THEM TAKING IN MORE INTENSE- IT. WE LIKE I MENTIONED IT WAS 70% OF- TWENTY EIGHTEEN RATES AS SINCE THEN WE'VE SEEN BUT- THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE WE'VE SEEN INFLATION IN THE PANDEMIC HAS BECAUSE- CLOSURES WHICH WERE NOT AS CERTAIN THAT WE WILL SEE RE OPENING SENSE A NUMBER OF OUR PROVIDERS ARE- MORE MATURE IN ARE ARE JUST RETIRING OUT OF THE SYSTEM. GIVEN THE COST TO CONTINUE OPERATING. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. RIGHT I DID WANT TO- I WANT TO MAKE IT JUST A FEW COMMENTS THAT I KNOW I DIDN'T GET IT I DID NOT MAKE EARLIER I DO WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND OUR TEACHERS. FOR THEIR DEDICATION TO SERVING OUR STATE'S CHILDREN FAMILIES ESPECIALLY DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND I THINK THAT THE PANELS HAVE BEEN CLEAR ON TWO THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND ONE IS THE WAIVER FAMILY FEES THE OTHER HAS TO DO. WITH FAIR COMPENSATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING SUCH AN IMPORTANT SERVICE. I OUR OUR TEACHERS OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS HAVE SERVED ON THE FRONT LINE. DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND HAVE RISK THEY'RE VERY HEALTH- TO SERVE OUR CHILDREN'S FAMILIES. OR DARK DARK BUT THE OUR FAMILIES CHILDREN- AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT RISK. FOR THEM PERSONALLY IN DOING THIS- SOME PEOPLE HAVE CALLED OUR PROVIDERS. HEROES DURING THIS TIME AND I JOIN WITH THOSE WHO HAVE. WHO HAVE SHARED THAT. I THE QUESTION OF BEING FAIRLY COMPENSATED ESPECIALLY BEING A CENTRAL WORKERS I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT THING AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS QUESTION EARLIER REGARDING THIS. ON THE WAIVER FAMILY FEES IF I MAY HAVE CAITLYN HUDSON FROM PARENT FORCES- SHE TESTIFIED EARLIER ABOUT. WHAT THIS MEANT FOR HER. CAITLYN ARE YOU STILL WITH US. WHAT CAITLYN SHARED IF SHE IS NO LONGER THAT SHE SAVED THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS. EVERY MONTH I WAS ABLE TO DO SO MUCH MORE WITH THAT MONEY ALL RIGHT THE QUESTION FOR CDSS THEM OF THE WAIVER OF THE FAMILY FEES IS SET TO END IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR JUST A FEW MONTHS FROM NOW. IS CBO SAYS THEM PREPARED TO EXTENDED THE WAIVER THROUGH SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE X. SHARE THANK YOU IF YOU'RE ASKING IF WE COULD OPERATIONALIZE THAT IS THAT THE QUESTION IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE I'M CORRECT IT WHAT LEGISLATURE SPOKEN WE OPERATIONALIZE THAT EXTENSION.

THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FREDERICK REACHED EIGHTY THOUSAND CHILD CARE SLOTS FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX OF WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO COST AN ADDITIONAL ONE BILLION GENERAL FUND BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN AND THE SECOND MAJOR ACTION I'LL HIGHLIGHT IS THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET I'M ALSO PROVIDED APPROVED INCREASED RATES OF CHILD CARE PROGRAMS WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN IT ALSO PROVIDES- TEMPORARY SUPPLEMENTAL RATES THAT. ARE IN EFFECT FROM JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSS THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET- WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL TO ANALYZE THE GENERAL CHILD CARE SLOTS THAT WERE PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET AGREEMENT FOR THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE MILLION TO COVER THE FULL YEAR COST GENERAL CHILD CARE SLOTS ADDED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- BASED ON COST PER CASE CALCULATIONS FROM THE TWENTY. ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET ACT WE EXPECTED THIS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WELL THE PROPOSED BUDGET ONLY INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED AND- THIRTY NINE MILLION LEFT WE EXPECTED- BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE DECREASED AMOUNT AVAILABLE. FOR SLOTS IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET IS DUE TO A CHANGE GEN METHODOLOGY- WE THINK THERE'S A SICKENING THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT OF. FROM THE BUT AGREEMENT GIVEN THAT- IT WOULD ONLY PROVIDE SICK PERCENT OF THE FUNDING. I'LL BE EXPECTED WOULD RESULT IN LESS SPENDING ON AN ONGOING BASIS FOR THE PROGRAM.

WHEN YOU THINK YOU COULD GET THAT DONE BY HOW'S THAT SOUND. CERTAINLY THANK YOU VERY GOOD. OKAY- THE THIRD. COUPLE QUESTIONS- I THINK WE WERE A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED TO- NOT THE RATE INCREASES- IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL AS PER FOR WHAT WE THOUGHT WE HAD AGREED TO IN THE BUDGET- IT'S OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT WAS A REASON WHY THAT WAS NOT IN THERE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION CAN BE CENTER WITH PARTNER FINANCE- AS- A KID JOHNSON HAD. REFERENCED AND THE STATE HAD BREACHED- THE FIRST AGREEMENT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH- SEE COULD BE YOU LAST YEAR- WHICH WAS CODIFIED INTO LAW THROUGH AB ONE THIRTY ONE- NEED AT. AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUT MAINTAIN THAT RATE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE REFLECTED IN THIS AGREEMENT THAT IS IN EFFECT JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE- ADDITIONALLY JUST ONE THING THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE AGREEMENT AT THE STATE ANTI SPEAKING YOU ARE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY THROUGH. A JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT HE OR JAIL AND SEE TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A SINGLE REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE THAT QUALITY STANDARDS FOR EQUITY AND ACCESSIBILITY WHILE SUPPORTING POSITIVE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN. AT THE DANCING WILL PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH OF THIS YEAR. BOB THE STATE IS ALSO CONVENING A SEPARATE WORK GROUP TO ASSESS THE METHODOLOGY FOR ESTABLISHING REIMBURSEMENT RATES. AND THE EXISTING QUALITY STANDARDS FOR CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. HI THIS BY WORKABLE PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LATER THAN AUGUST FIFTEENTH OF THIS YEAR. I'M SORRY WHAT'S THE- POINT OF THE RESEARCH THAT ALL THE RESEARCH SAYS THAT THE RATES ARE TO ALLOW US TO DO YOU NEED. I DON'T THINK WE NEED SOMEBODY ELSE TO TELL US THE RESEARCH ABOUT. SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS. RESEARCH. SURE AT THE AND THE INTENSITY IS TO FURTHER DELVE INTO- RECOMMENDATIONS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED- IT WAS A COMMON RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT FOR NEXT YEAR. HOW TO GET TO MY QUESTION. CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT ISSUES YOU WERE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THAT SOMEHOW THE RATE STUDY FOR ALL THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ILLUMINATE. FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK THAT THAT I SHOULD NOTE- THAT THE CRIMINALS REACHED LAST YEAR- RECOGNIZES THAT THEY'RE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED- IT'S JUST THE- IT IS WITH THE INTENT TO SET TO ENGAGE IN. CONVERSATIONS TO. I WAS IN THE ROOM WITH THAT AGREEMENT AND ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AGREEMENTS WITH- PUBLICLY FUNDED CHILDCARE SO THE WHOLE PRIVATE SECTOR OF CHILD CARE WHICH IS NOT PART OF THAT UNDERSTOOD THAT AGREEMENT SO- COULD YOU. TO EDUCATE US AS TO WHAT ISSUES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. BECAUSE I I'M I'M NOT AWARE OF WHAT THEY ARE SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE. TELL THE COMMITTEE WHAT THEY ARE. AT A CERTAIN I MIGHT ADD TO FOR TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT AND THE EXTENT ONE THREE THANK YOU- THIS IS KEN JOHNSON AT THE PARKING OF SOCIAL SERVICES JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. RELATED YOUR QUESTIONS RELATED TO RATES THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THESE WORK GROUPS ARE OUTLINED TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS ON CREATING A UNIFIED RATE STRUCTURE. TODAY THERE IS THE REGIONAL MARKET RATES AND THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE. AND THOSE RATES ARE HE DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES BASED ON. THE TYPE OF. THAT PROGRAM IS BEING OPERATED SO. AT PRIVATE PROVIDERS TO YOUR TO YOUR POINTS OUT CAN CERTAINLY ACCESS. CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES THAT ARE PAID TO THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE STRUCTURE. THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE IS FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONTRACTED. TO PROVIDE THOSE SUBSIDIES IN LARGE ENOUGH CERTAIN NUMBER OF STEPS THESE PER AT PROGRAM. AND SO PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKGROUP ARE TO CREATE ONE. UNIFIED RATE STRUCTURE I WITNESSED AT THE ENTIRETY OF A PROGRAMS BETTER AGAIN. SUPPORTING AT. BUT OUR LOW INCOME BETTER ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES AND WHAT THAT. WOULD LOOK LIKE. IN ADDITION TO THAT UNIFIED RATE STRUCTURE THERE'S ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO HOW WE ESTABLISH. OUR THOSE RATES AND AGAIN THE STANDARD REMEMBER RECENT RATE STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE IS WE ACTUALLY CONDUCT A SURVEY. AFTER THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY AT TO GET TO ADD IDENTIFIED FIVE REGION. I WATCHED THAT PROVIDERS ARE CURRENTLY CHARGING. THEM SO AGAIN LOOKING AT UNIFIED RATE STRUCTURE. AND LOOKING AT THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE DEVELOP THE RATE. STRUCTURE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR ANSWER A SO. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THE WE HAVE A REGIONAL RATE STRUCTURE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN COST OF LIVING VRY VERY LARGE. DIFFERENCES TO HOW WITH. THE END AND I'M NOT AGAIN I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR KEEPING THE REGIONAL RATE STRUCTURE I THINK WE'VE ALL SEEN- IT'S CHALLENGES OVER THE YEARS. BUT HOW WOULD YOU THEN INCORPORATE THE COST OF LIVING DIFFERENCES INTO I GUESS WHAT WHAT I HEAR A REUNIFIED RATE STRUCTURE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. A SINGLE RATE STRUCTURE FOR THE- STATE WHICH I ASSUME IS KIND OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING MY QUESTION WAS HOW HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE REGIONAL COSTS OF LIVING DIFFERENCES. SURE SURE SO WE COULD STILL WITHIN A UNIFIED STRUCTURE THINK ABOUT THE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES THAT CAN CERTAINLY BE PART OF HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT THAT'S KIND OF A CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORK GROUPS NOW. SINGLE IS JUST SIMPLY TO SAY WHY DO WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURES IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE FIELD. CAN WE HAVE ONE IN THE IN THE GET THAT ONE COULD ABSOLUTELY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT REGIONAL DIFFERENCES THAT'S EXACTLY THE WORK AB. AT THE COMMITTEES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ALLOWS FOR A SURVEY AGAIN THIS REGIONAL SERVICE THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING HISTORICALLY IN CALIFORNIA IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES TO IDENTIFY HABITS THAT THOSE RATE SO AGAIN. I THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING TO DETERMINE ALL THINGS CONSIDERED TO YOUR POINT AROUND- IN IN WHAT IN THAT PANEL IS THAT I'VE SPOKEN THIS MORNING I WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS THAT NEED TO BE PART OF A UNIFIED STRUCTURE. EVEN IF EVEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. UNDERSTOOD BUT I THINK I THINK MY CONCERN IS WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT IS. ALREADY UNDER- WE KNOW THAT THEIR ALSO INDUSTRY WHICH IS VERY CRITICAL FOR THE STATE TO GET A CERTAIN SEGMENT. OF ITS WORK FORCE BACK TO WORK. A I KNOW IF YOU ANSWER THE I POSE TO PARTNER FINANCE. WHY PLEASANT THE- WHY WHY WASN'T THE RATE INCREASE. THAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED IN THE IN THE BUDGET. BUT A TITO SOUNDED LIKE OR WOULD WE NEED SOME MORE TIME TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND I THINK- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S DOING MORE RESEARCH TO DETERMINE THAT THIS FIELD IS UNDERFUNDED. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGAINST THE RATE INCREASES THAT WERE AGREED TO THEIR WITHIN THE SCOPE OF MARKETING. AND THEY AFFECT THEY WERE INCLUDED IN THE MAIN AGREEMENT WHICH IS A TWO YEAR AGREEMENT SO THEY ARE THERE LET ME JUST LET ME JUST. KIND OF AT A SURE YOU GOT THE RATE INCREASES THAT WERE AGREED TO AB AS OUTLINED IN THAT MADE AGREEMENT WITH CHILD CARE PROVIDED UNITED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE THERE IN THOSE CONTINUE THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY THREE. RIGHT BUT THOSE ARE THE ONLY THE GROUPS ARE REPRESENTED BUT THERE'S A WHOLE SEGMENT OF GROUPS THAT ARE REPRESENTED THAT WEREN'T AT THE- TABLE SO YOU'RE JUST. PUTTING THOSE. IMPOSING THOSE RATES THAT WERE NOT AGREED TO BY THE PEOPLE ON TO THEM. THE INCREASES ARE UNIVERSAL FOR ANYONE RECEIVING THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE. AND EXTENT THE REFILLS ARE INCLUDED IN BOTH COMPONENTS SO YES THOSE WERE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE MADE UNIVERSALLY. AFTER BOTH RATE STRUCTURES OKAY. SO- WHERE WERE WERE ASSUMING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S GONNA- FUND A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND NEW SLOTS FOR CHILD CARE- ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO I JUST CONTACTED PART OF FINANCE ARE WE GONNA BE SEEN THOSE ESTIMATES BEFORE THE MAY REVERSE. HI GOOD MORNING THIS IS SAID TOMORROW WEBER FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WHEN AND- IT IS THE INTENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADHERE TO THE COMMITMENTS MADE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT TO INCREASE CHILD CARE SLOTS AND WE APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE L. A. O. TO DO SO. I WILL CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE L. A. O. AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO CONSIDER ALTERNATE BUDGET METHODOLOGIES TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF SLOTS AND ANY REVISIONS WOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR FISHING TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OKAY SO- SO THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A YESTERDAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING DISCUSSIONS AROUND ESTIMATES ARE PRIVATE OR MAYBE LESS IS A- IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING. WE'RE IN CONVERSATIONS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS LEADING UP TO THE MAY REVISE OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. SOME ARRESTS. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE- PROVIDERS AN EARLY EDUCATORS WE ARE INCLUDING OUR HEAD START TEACHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALL FAIRLY COMPENSATED FOR THEIR WORK- I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS- WORK IN TRYING TO INCREASE THIS. BEYOND EVEN WHAT SOME SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE OTHER GROUPS ARE REQUESTING AND ALSO SPECIFICALLY- TO INCLUDE THE COLA WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU I'D WANT TO GO BACK TO CD AND I KNOW I KNOW I MISSED THIS- BUT I DON'T THINK UNDERSTANDING BEGIN QUITE ANSWER THIS SUBSIDY YOU CAN ANSWER US. AS FAR AS WHAT THE COST WOULD BE TO DO THE RATE REFORM EFFORTS A PRESCHOOL TO GET PASSED TO THE NINETY PERCENTILE FOR THE- REGIONAL MARKET RATE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS VIRGINIA EARLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WE WOULD NEED AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION TO GET TO THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY. SO THAT'S FROM OUR CURRENT RATES TIED TO THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE THE RIGHT SUPPLEMENTS FUNDING- FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET IS GETTING US. CLOSE TO THAT BUT THAT RATE SUPPLEMENTS FUNDING IS TEMPORARY. FOR ESTIMATING THAT THE RIGHT SUPPLEMENTS FUNDS WILL GET US TO THE EIGHTY FOURTH PERCENTILE. AND THEN- SO DURING ONE OF THOSE ARE IN EFFECT IT'S AN EXTRA TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AND THEN WHEN THE RIGHT SUPPLEMENTS FUNDS EXPIRE IT WILL BE AND YOU KNOW THE FULL THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION ONGOING. YEAH AND THIS IS. WE HEAR LL THE OTHER SPEAKERS SOME OF THE COMMON DENOMINATORS ARE- CHALLENGES AND MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND JUST THE FINANCIAL STRESS OF OPERATING- EITHER A CHILD CARE CENTERS STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. YOU KNOW WE WE'RE NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH TO PAY LIVABLE WAGES AND WE SET ALL TIME IS A FRAGILE WORKFORCE YOU KNOW PEOPLE LOVE WORKING WITH YOUNG KIDS BUT THEY CAN GO WORK AT COSCO OR STARBUCKS AND WAKE MAKE WAY MORE MONEY. AND HAVE FAR LESS STRESS PROBABLY SO WE DID HALF THE JOB LAST THROUGH RATE REFORM AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CLEAR THE MINISTRATION IS WERE NOT DONE WE WANT TO BE FULLY FUNDED FROM LAST YEAR'S DEAL NOT ALTERNATIVE BUDGETARY GIMMICKS THAT SOUNDS LIKE ALTERNATIVE FACTSTHERE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE PROPERLY FIND LAST YEAR'S ARRANGEMENT BUT WE REALIZE THAT'S NOT NOT DONE WE WANT TO COMPLETE. THE JOB AND SO I KNOW RIGHT HERE THANK YOU FOR THREE HUNDRED PLUS MILLION WE CAN GET US TO THE- THE RATE REFORM AND GETTING SAID NINETY PERCENTILE WE'RE GOING TO GET WITH THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE AND THAT'S A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AND SO THAT WILL CERTAINLY BE OUR PRIORITY AS WE FINALIZE. THE ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THIS BUDGET AND I ASSUME THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE SENATE AS WELL. SO JUST ONE OF A MARKER DOWN THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY FOR US HERE- SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER. TWO WE WILL PROCEED NOW WITH ISSUE NUMBER THREE. WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM OVERSIGHT IN JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSALS WE WILL HEAR FROM HER AND FINANCE L. A. OF CD AS WELL AS A ENTITY FROM- THE TULARE- COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. BERMAN A FINANCE PLEASE PROCEED. THE MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GENERALLY RUN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL BE GIVING AN OVERVIEW OF THREE PROPOSALS PUT FORTH IN THE JANUARY BUDGET THE FIRST PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO MAKE CHANGES TO ELIGIBILITY AND I KNEW REQUIREMENTS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO INCREASE ACCESS TO INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS TO EXPAND THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM AND THE THIRD PROPOSAL IS FOR EDUCATOR TRAINING ON PRESCHOOL ASSESSMENT TOOLS. MINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES HAVE BETTER LONG TERM OUTCOMES IN THIS DISABILITIES ARE IDENTIFIED EARLY AND INTERVENTIONS BEGAN AT A YOUNG AGE HOWEVER WHILE ABOUT 12% OF STUDENTS IN PUBLICATION TWELVE SCHOOLS STATEWIDE HAVE A DISABILITY ONLY ABOUT 4% OF STUDENTS AND STATE PRESCHOOL OUR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. MEANWHILE THE FEDERAL HEAD START PROGRAM REQUIRES AND ROOM INCLUDE AT LEAST 10% OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. TO INCREASE ACCESSTO INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS AND TO ALIGN WITH HEAD START THE BUDGET REQUIRES STATE PRESCHOOL CONTRACTORS TO MAINTAIN ENROLLMENT OF AT LEAST TO PROVIDE CONTRACTORS WITH THE FUNDS NCESSARY TO SERVE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WITH POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT NEEDS. THE BUDGET PROVIDES A HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN POINT EIGHT. MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION GENERAL FUND TO INCREASE THE ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FOR THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT. TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND TO LANGUAGE LEARNERS. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES SEVERAL CHANGES TO ELIGIBILITY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO STATE PRESCHOOL. FIRST THE BUDGET INCLUDES CATEGORICAL ELIGIBILITY TO STATE PRESCHOOL FOR ALL AGE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WITH WITH DISABILITIES REGARDLESS OF INCOME. SECOND AUSTIN'S PARTICIPATING IN STATE PRESCHOOL WILL MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY FOR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AS OPPOSED TO TWELVE MONTHS. AND FINALLY PROVIDERS THAT HAVE SERVED ALL ELIGIBLE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN THEIR SERVICE WILL BE ALLOWED TO SERVE TWO YEAR OLD CHILDREN. THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS FOR INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM. AS YOU MAY RECALL THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS PART OF THE EDUCATION ON MYSELF. EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM IS A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR ALLOCATION TO LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO INCLUSIVE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. BUT MAYBE IT'S FOR FACILITIES ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE ADMINISTRATION OF KNOWLEDGE AS THE INCLUSIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NOT ONLY STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ALSO GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM. AND SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS INCLUDE INCLUSIVE CLASSROOMS. OF THESE FUNDS THE SUPERINTENDENT ALLOCATE UP TO FIFTY MILLION TO WORK WITH LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AS ACCOUNT SUCH AS THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. EFFORTS TO OFFER A LINE EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THE THIRD PROPOSAL IS AIMED AYE AT IDENTIFYING SOCIAL DISABILITIES- EARLY AND STARTING INTERVENTIONS AT A YOUNG AGE AS PRESCHOOL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IS EXPANDED WE SHOULD FURTHER REFINED THE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT TOOLS USED FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF STUDENTS. WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES AND ENSURE TEACHERS RECEIVE THE TRAINING TO EFFICIENTLY USE THEM IN A LINE WITH THIS THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWO MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO INCORPORATE EARLY IDENTIFICATION FOR LEARNING DISABILITIES. INTO THE DESIRED RESULTS DEVELOPMENTAL PROFILE INCLUDING A ONE IT INCLUDING A PROCESS FOR FOLLOW UP EXPERT ABOUT THE LEADERS AND SIXTY MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR EDUCATORS ON EFFECTIVE USE OF THESE TOOLS. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU L. A. L. THERE CORD HAS L. A. L. AND WE JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS REGARDING THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT THAT 10% OF CHILDREN ENROLLED OUR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES- SO IMPLEMENTING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD MEETING STATE PRESCHOOLS PROVIDERS WE NEED TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO HOW THEY OPERATE AND THIS MAY INCLUDE MODIFICATIONS TO THE EXISTING CURRICULUM IMPROVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER AGENCIES THAT CAN REFER STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. WELL FOR SOME PROVIDERS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT OPERATE THE HEAD START PROGRAM THEY MAY NOT NEED TO MAKE MUCH MODIFICATION GIVEN THAT THEY ALREADY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS- THAT THAT THE STATE REQUIREMENT- WE WOULD NOTE THAT MEETING THE STATE CORRECTIONAL WOULD BE RELATIVELY EASIER FOR- LBJ'S PROVIDERS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES TO THEIR STUDENTS. AT LEAST MAY HAVE AN EASIER TIME HAVING STUDENTS REFERRED TO ACTUALLY PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPERTS ALTERNATIVELY NON ELITE PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY THOUGH NOT OPERATING HEAD START PROGRAMS WILL LIKELY FIND SERVING  LARGER SHARE OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES MORE CHALLENGING- TO THIS AND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE SET ASIDE A LARGER PORTION OF THE- OF THE FUNDING FOR STATE LEVEL SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT THEY CAN BE ACCESSED. BY NOT LA PROVIDERS. IS THAT YOUR COULD ALSO CONSIDER RE DIRECT OTHER SO FUNDING FOR NON ELITE TRAINING AND- THE LAST THING I WANT TO LOOK FOR. TO THE PERCENT REQUIRE. IT WILL THINK POINT LOGISTIC MAIN TO. THE FUNCTIONAL IN A FEW YEARS. IN LIGHT OF THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT WILL BE OCCURRING IN EARLY EDUCATION WITH THE EXPANSION OF TRADITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DISSERTATION ROLES- WE JUST. LIKE TO KNOW THAT THAT THEY'RE SOME OF THE TRADE OFF HERE- THIS COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO PROVIDERS AS IT WOULD HELP ENSURE PROGRAMS ARE FULLY ENROLLED. HOWEVER PROVIDERS MAY NEED TO MAKE SOME- PROGRAM PHYSICALLY MODIFICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVING FOR STAFF FOR CHILD EIGHT- HAVING TO CHANGING STATIONS. GIVEN ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITIES OF THIS CHANGE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO WAIT A FEW YEARS AND SEE HOW THE EXPANSION OF KFX PRESCHOOL ENROLLMENT BEFORE DECIDING. TO ADJUST ELIGIBILITY IN THIS WAY THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY YOU WELL HERE NOW FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION VIRGINIA EARLY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS VIRGINIA EARLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO ALSO ASKED WE WILL CHECK IN MY LOUD ENOUGH. YEAH WE CAN HEAR YOU TOO WELL SOME MEASUREMENTS ARE- SYSTEM HERE YOU SO MAYBE YOU CAN GET A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOUR MIKE ALL RIGHT. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME BETTER NOW SAM THIS IS IT'S THE SAME I THINK MAYBE IT MAYBE IT'S US. IS THAT OUR SYSTEM IN. YES. THANK THAT THINGS OPEN UP THERE. ALCHEMY CLIMATE IS THAT. THE YOUNG ACTOR YOUNG AND AGILE. ON THE TELEPHONE KEY. OKAY PLEASE POLICY. GO AHEAD ALL RIGHT GOOD YOUR BREAKING POINT ALL RIGHT SO GOOD MORNING AGAIN EVERYONE VIRGINIA EARLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I WILL BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT OUR SOME OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR RECENT CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM INVESTMENTS I'M ALSO BRIEFLY SHARE SOME COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO IN TERMS OF THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION FOR C. S. P. P. EXPANSION AND THE BUDGET LAST YEAR BUT WE ESTIMATE THIS WILL ALLOW FOR ABOUT EIGHTY SIX HUNDRED NEWS ST PRESCHOOL SLOTS I WILL KNOW MORE AFTER WE'VE RECEIVED THOSE APPLICATIONS BACK APRIL SEVENTH AND SEE THE RATIO BETWEEN PART AND FULL DAY REQUEST FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATED FUNDS FOR ABOUT TWENTY NINE HUNDRED FULL DAY SLOTS. BUT WHAT ENDED UP BEING FUNDED WISE ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED FULL DAY SLOTS AND ABOUT- FORTY THREE HUNDRED PART DAY SLOTS ON RATES WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT OUR CONTRACTORS PROVIDING PRESCHOOL AND EIGHTEEN OF OUR HIGHER COST CALIFORNIA COUNTIES RECEIVED A RATE INCREASE TO THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REGIONAL MARKET RATE. ON JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR WE'RE ALSO ENTERING ON THOSE RATE SUPPLEMENTS THAT I MENTIONED ON OUR LAST PANEL WHICH WE EXPECT TO GET US TEMPORARILY. UP TO THE EIGHTY FOURTH PERCENTILE. I WELL THE RATE SOMETHING ARE. WE REALLY LIKE TO SEE FUTURE INCREASES AND OUR CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM RATE TO SUPPORT EQUITY ACROSS OUR SYSTEM AND ALSO TO BRING GREATER EQUITY BETWEEN THE PRESCHOOL RIGHT. HANDS THE INFANT TODDLER AND SCHOOL AGE RATES SO FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS INVESTMENTS MADE A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO THE INFANT TODDLER RATE. I AND THOSE ADJUSTMENT FACTORS UNDER OLD RATE SYSTEM THE MAJORITY OF INFANT TODDLER REIMBURSEMENT RATES ALREADY EXCEEDED THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE BEFORE THE RECENT CHANGES. I DO HAVE MORE COST INFORMATION FOR FUTURE CHANGES IN FRONT OF ME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THAT IT'S HELPFUL WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT THAT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION NUMBER IS AN INCREASE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. SO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS AS WELL. ON THE BUDGET PROPOSAL I THE BUDGET PROPOSALS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENTS AND INCLUSION ARE SUPPORTING MULTILINGUAL LEARNERS AND ENSURING STABILITY FOR CHILDREN ENROLLED IN STATE PRESCHOOL. ON INCLUSION THAT'S A REALLY KEY ISSUE FOR US SINCE AS WE LOOK AT THE DATA WE REALLY LAG BEHIND OTHER STATE AND THE NATION IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. IN WHAT'S CALLED THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S WHERE CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED. WITH DISABILITIES ARE ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS IN PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF IN A SPECIAL DAY CLASSROOMS- THAT'S ONLY FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. SO IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE CALIFORNIA SERVED UNDER 30% OF PRESCHOOLERS WITH INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLANS OR IEPS. IN AN INCLUSIVE STARTING. SO AS WE LOOK AT THE RESEARCH IT REALLY SHOWS US THAT WHEN WE SERVE CHILDREN WITH IEPS IN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS THEY'LL HAVE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE START WHEN THEY'RE NOT SERVED IN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS. THEY HAVE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES- TO ACCESS GENERAL EDUCATION THEY TEND TO REMAIN IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND THAT WHEN WE INCREASED THAT PROPORTION OF THEIR TIME SPENT AND GENERAL EDUCATION. THAT IS A STRONG PREDICTOR OF ACADEMIC GROWTH IMPROVED OUTCOMES AND INTENTIONALLY THIS SUPPORTS ALL CHILDREN BOTH OF THOSE AND WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES. BUDGET PROPOSAL STRATEGIES ARE REALLY KEY FOR ADDRESSING THAT FULL INCLUSION KEYS ARE IN PURPLE PROVIDING SUPPORTS TO PROGRAMS TO GET THEIR- SO WITH NEARLY THIRTY SIX THOUSAND PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH IEPS IN CALIFORNIA NOT SERVED IN AN INCLUSIVE PROGRAM WE DO EXPECT THAT STATE PRESCHOOL CONTRACTORS WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE 10% REQUIREMENT. ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE GIVEN TIME IN SUPPORT TO DO SO AS IS THE CASE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WE REALLY THINK A KEY PART OF THIS IS THOSE INVESTMENTS THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM OR KEEP. AS WELL AS THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION WHICH WILL SUPPORT I'M NEEDING THAT TEN PERCENT. ON THE EVE WE HAVE HEARD FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE STATE PRESCHOOL BUT THEY WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM SUPPORT PROVIDED THROUGH THE PROGRAM SO WE DON'T MINOR COMMENTS HERE WITH THE L. A. IN FLAGGING THE NEED FOR FUNDS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THIS COULD BE DONE EITHER BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT. OF FOR STATE LEVEL TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WILL SUPPORT ALL PROGRAMS INCLUDING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON WHAT THE NEED. IS THERE AND WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT. UNDER OTHER STATE PRESCHOOL ON THE OTHER STATE PRESCHOOL PROPOSAL SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE- THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE ADJUSTMENT FACTOR FOR DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND THE PROPOSAL AROUND TWENTY FOUR MONTH ELIGIBILITY SINCE THAT WILL PROVIDE STABILITY FOR FAMILIES. OUT FOR TWO YEARS OF HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING BEFORE KINDERGARTEN. I'M SERVING A TWO YEAR OLD CHILDREN IN STATE PRESCHOOL WE KNOW THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT MANY WILL BE SERVED I SINCE THEIR LAST PRIORITY UNDER THE LANGUAGE. AND ONLY 13% OF ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLDS IN STATE ARE SERVED IN STATE PRESCHOOL. ARE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THOSE CHILDREN ARE IN DEVELOPMENTALLY DIFFERENT PLACES SO THEY'RE GONNA NEED DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM. THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD NEED TO ADDRESS AT CD AND R. REGULATIONS AS PART OF IMPLEMENTATION HERE WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH- ARE YOU UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN. RESEARCH DESIGN TEAM WHICH INCLUDES NATIONAL EXPERTS TO LOOK AT WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE HERE. BUT EVEN WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR CURRENT STANDARDS AROUND- RATIOS- ARE THERE ARE THERE DIFFERENT NEEDS THERE IS THE L. A. R. MENTIONED. STILL GIVEN ALL OF THIS WE HEAR FROM CONTRACTORS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ADJUSTMENT FACTOR FOR THESE CHILDREN TO COVER THEIR ADDITIONAL COSTS. IN CLOSING WE ALSO HEAR FROM THE FIELD THAT THERE ARE SOME STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO STATE PRESCHOOL THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN ITS BUILT ABILITY TO BE A STRONG PARTNER. IN THE UNIVERSAL PRE KINDERGARTEN SYSTEM AND THOSE INCLUDING MAKING IT STATE PRESCHOOL LICENSE EXEMPT ALLEGATIONS FOR BOTH THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. USING THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER REDUCING OR REMOVING FAMILY FEES OF FOR STATE PRESCHOOL TO PROBE TO ENSURE FAMILY CHOICE AND EASE OF ABILITY TO PARTNER BETWEEN. ALL THE AS AND THEN FUNDING STATE PRE SCHOOL BASED ON ENROLLMENT RATHER THAN ATTENDANCE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MY NAME'S ERIC SONNENFELD WITH LAKE COUNTY HOSTAGE CATION. I ALSO SERVED AS A MEMBER ON THE RATE REFORM METHODOLOGY WORKGROUP THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER DURING THE PRESENTATIONS AND ALSO REPRESENTING EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA. HANK YOU FOR THE OCT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS- COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF EARLY LEARNING CARE IN OUR STATE AS A CRUCIAL- HI. SUPPORT TO ARE NOT ONLY ARE WORKING FAMILIES BUT THE YOUNGEST AMONG US. AND I WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN- HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER TODAY. BUT FOR THE CFP PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOURTEEN OUT OF THE SIXTY FIVE COUNTY SERVICE AREAS WHICH IS 62% DID NOT. RECEIVE RATE REFORM RELIEF OF JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TO THE SHIFT FROM THE S. R. ARCH OF THE REGIONAL MARKET RIGHT. THE CAN SERVICE AREAS THAT DID. INCREASE THAT INCREASE RANGED FROM 68% A MERE 2% ILLUSTRATES THE ONGOING WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THE IN EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE AND ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE QUALITY SERVICES AND RETAIN QUALITY STAFF IN A VERY COMPETITIVE JOB MARKET CORRECT LET'S THAT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION MENTION WILL ASSIST HOWEVER IF THEY ARE ALLOCATED UNITS UTILIZING THE SAME METHODOLOGY WILL MAKE THIS INEQUITY STATEWIDE EVEN WORSE. THE DRESS THE TO YOUR PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS- PUT FORTH THERE IS CONCERN RELATED TO THE RATIO REQUIREMENTS FOR THE YOUNGER LEARNERS AND THE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS. YOU JUST FACTOR- THIRTY WOULD BE NEEDED EITHER IN REGULATION OR LAW TO ENSURE THAT. THE FUNDS ARE THERE TO SUPPORT AGENCIES. TO PURSUE THIS AS AN AVENUE OF SERVICE MODEL DELIVERY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONAL ONGOING TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT STATE THE SCHOOL WORKFORCE TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF YOUNGER CHILDREN. AND MANY OTHER CASE MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE THESE CHILDREN DUE TO- EXISTING LABOR AGREEMENTS. TO SPECIFIC ETHNIC GROUPS SO THAT WOULD ALSO NEED TO BE POTENTIALLY ADDRESS AS WELL. REGARDING THE SPECIAL NEEDS PROPOSAL THAT IS NOT AS CLEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROPOSAL. WE APPRECIATE THE 10% SET ASIDE TO SERVE CHILDREN SPECIAL NEEDS. AND JUSTIN FACTOR OF TWO POINT FOUR FOR STATE FISCAL CONTRACTED TO SERVE THOSE CHILDREN. AT THE HEAD START GRANTEE MYSELF AS MY IN MY AGENCY IT WILL. THAT WILL START TO CLOSE THE GAP TO SERVE OUR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN IN STATE PRESCHOOL. BUT I WILL REMIND THE PANEL AND EVERYONE WHO IS LISTENING THAT STAFF WILL NEED NOT JUST ONE TIME TRAINING. BUT CONTINUED AND ONGOING TRAINING AS EASY OR EASY WORKFORCE WILL BE TRANSITIONING. THROUGH THE IMPACT OF THE G. CARE ROLLOUT THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE LABOR. MARKET AND THE JUST GENERAL TURNOVER THAT THE EARLY EDUCATION FIELD EXPERIENCES. ARE CURRENTLY. KIND OF SITUATIONS COULD BE AN AVENUE TO LINK THE- SERVICE THAT SETS FOR ME BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO SERVE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS TO PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL TRICKS- TRAINING AND SUPPORT ONGOING. NOT JUST ONE TIME. AND FINALLY- SPECIFIC ASKS EXTEND THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS AND FLEXIBILITY GRANTED TO DIRECT SERVICE CONTRACTING AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS DURING THE ENDEMIC INTO FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. CONTINUE TO WAIVER OF FAMILY FEEDS INTO TO IT'S CLEAR TWENTY FIVE THREE AND THE BACK FILLING TO THE CONTRACTING AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS. ALSO TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASES SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE FORTY KEVIN SERVICE AREAS THAT DID NOT BENEFIT FROM THE ALIGNMENT OF THE S. R. ARTS THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TRYING TWO. STATE PROGRAMS CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE RATE REFORM WORK GROUP RECOMMENDATIONS. IF THE STATE WANTS YES COULD BE CONTRACTORS TO BE A CONTINUED VIABLE PARTNER THE ROLL OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLANNED FOR EARLY LEARNING AND TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL TO ALL. ELIGIBLE FOR ENTRY ROLE. THANK YOU UNPAYABLE QUESTION. OKAY THANK YOU WILL HAVE A FEW ON THIS ALSO ALL START OUT WITH I KNOW LAST YEAR CENTER WE MOAN AND THE NUMBER OF US WORK ON THE COMPANION BILL TO THE UNIVERSAL TKA WITH THIS SB ONE FIFTY TO REVISE THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY IN THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT. AND SAID HE'D COME BACK WITH PROPOSALS THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WHICH THEY DO- THE ONE THAT'S NOT THERE IS THE ODD THAT THE TODDLER RATES IN THE STANDARDS FOR TWO YEAR OLDS IN PRESCHOOL I WANTED TO ASK. BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN CDP TO TALK ABOUT THIS LET'S START WITH DEPARTMENT OF. OF- EDUCATION ACTUALLY. AND AND AS WE LOOK ABOUT WE HEARD FROM THE EARLIER SPEAKERS AND- AND THE FIELD IN THE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO FOUR YEAR OLD SO- WHAT COULD WE DO TO BETTER. ALIGN OUR POLICIES TO PRIORITIZE AND FURTHER INCREASE. THE RATE STRUCTURES FOUR. ZERO THREE THREE YEAR OLDS. THANK YOU VIRGINIA EARLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO IN TERMS OF SERVING OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE TWO YEAR OLDS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM LIKE LIKE I DID MENTION- WE DO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE NEED OF. THAT HAVING AN A JOB SOME TYPE OF ADJUSTMENT FACTOR HIGHER RATE FOR THOSE CHILDREN. BECAUSE AS THE L. A. O. MENTION THEIR DIFFERENT RATIOS THAT CURRENTLY APPLY SO SPECIFICALLY- UNDER OUR CURRENT REGULATIONS PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVING CHILDREN EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ONE ADULT FOR EVERY FOUR CHILDREN. AND THEN IT BUT ONE TEACHER FOR EVERY SIXTEEN CHILDREN AND THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE RATIOS WE HAVE. UP FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WHERE IT'S ONE ADULT FOR EVERY EIGHT CHILDREN AND ONE TEACHER FOR EVERY TWENTY FOUR CHILDREN SO WHEN YOU ADD AN EXTRA JOLT AND YOU ADD AN EXTRA TEACHERS IN THOSE SMALLER SIZES. BUT THAT DOES CREATE EXTRA COSTS FOR PROGRAMS- THIS COULD BE ADDRESSED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH- THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION- AS YOU WORK THROUGH- AT THAT THESE PROPOSALS GOING FORWARD. HE SO SPECIFICALLY WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD WE NEED- AS FAR AS THA RATE ADJUSTMENT FOR ZERO THREE THREE IF YOU HEAR THE COMMON DENOMINATOR FROM SOME OF THE EARLIER SPEAKERS IN THE FIELD- ABOUT THE CONCERNS FOR THE YOU KNOW RATIOS AND- AND JUST NOT ADEQUATE. REIMBURSEMENT RATES I KNOW YOU'D GIVE US A NUMBER FOR WHAT THAT- THE NINETY PERCENT. REGIONAL MARKET RATE FOR STATE PRESCHOOL WOULD BE THIS IS ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS WHOLE GREAT. PIECE FINISHING THE JOB WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT TO INCREASE FOR ZERO THREE THREE. TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS VIABLE. YOU KNOW PAID LIVING WAGES AND THEN THE YOU KNOW TIÞN TO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH UNIVERSAL ACCESS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS WHICH IS THE NEXT OF COURSE THE GENOCIDE IN WHICH IS LAW IN CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ADJUSTMENT FACTORS THAT ARE OPERATIONAL FOR THIS AGE GROUP- FOR THE PROGRAMS FOR THE GENERAL CHILD CARE PROGRAM THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OPERATE. OUR CHILDREN IN THIS AGE GROUP THAT THIS THIS TWO YEAR OLD AGE GROUP ARE GETTING A ONE POINT EIGHT ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. SO SO THAT WOULD SORT OF BRING THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SERVING- SERVING TWO pCOMPARABILITY WITH WHAT THE ACCESS IS PROVIDING. OKAY THANK YOU AGAIN THIS IS JUSTIN YOU KNOW YOU'RE A PRIORITY FOR. THE ASSEMBLY AND WILL LIKELY ADDRESSES THAT ARE. THE PROPOSAL IN THE COMING MONTHS. QUESTIONS ON A FRED COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON ISSUE NUMBER THREE.

WITH REGARD TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE PROPOSED BUDGET AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS AT THIS TIME I'M AND WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE PREVENTION CALCULATIONS ARE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE WOULD HAVE. EXPECTED THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. LEANING GRANT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS- I'LL BE PRESENTING WITH WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION AS WELL AS THE ADULT TO STUDENT- ADULT TO STUDENT RATIO REDUCTION PROPOSAL SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A REVENGE OF THE TEST ONE PERCENTAGE OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ESTIMATED INCREASED COST OF ADDITIONAL STUDENTS SERVED IN TRADITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AS A RESULT OF THE EXPANSION THAT WAS APPROVED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. AT BUDGET ACT FOR A TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THIS EXPANSION IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION AND AS A REMINDER IT REFLECTS OPENING TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN TO ALL CHILDREN TURNING FIVE BETWEEN SEPTEMBER SECOND AND FEBRUARY SECOND% RATHER THAN SEPTEMBER SECOND IS DECEMBER SECOND. BEGINNING WITH THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SCHOOL YEAR. WELL THAT'S NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED THE PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE TO ADJUST THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT CALCULATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FOR THE MOVEMENT. AND FUNDING OF PROGRAMS WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE GUARANTEED RELATIVE TO NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SEVEN LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO THE INCREASED L. C. F. F. FUNDING PROVIDED FOR EXPANDING TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES A SEPARATE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FORTY K. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. TO HELP LEDS REDUCE ADULT STUDENT RATIOS TWO ONE TO TWELVE PER TKA CLASSROOM THAT'S PURSUANT TO STATUTE- AND THIS CONCLUDES MY BRIEF PRESENTATION- MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS BERGSON IS ALSO ON THE LINE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE A QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SERO SERO NEVER MORGAN DEPARTMENT OF AN- GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THERE AN APPLE MARKET ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE HISTORIC INVESTMENT BEGAN LAST YEAR IN UNIVERSAL PRE KINDERGARTEN FOR U. P. K. AND CONTINUED WITH THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT THE FIRST YEAR AND FORTY K. EXPANSION AND REDUCING THE ADULT CHILD RATIOS IN TKA. TO SUPPORT THIS HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN DECEMBER CVD RELEASED A TEMPLATE FOR ELEAZAR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO USE IN THEIR U. P. K. PLANNING THE TEMPLATE COVERS BASIC COHERENCE. AND UNITY ENGAGEMENT AND PARTNERSHIPS WORKFORCE RECRUITMENT AND PROFESSIONAL LEARNING CURRICULUM INSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT FACILITY SERVICES AN OPERATION THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT WHEN YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING THE PK. IN FEBRUARY WE ALSO RELEASED NINETY FIVE PAGES OF GUIDANCE TO SUPPORT AND LIAISE CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING PLANS FOR EXPANDING U. P. K. WHICH ARE DUE TO THEIR LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS OR BODIES FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. FIFTY EIGHTY PLANS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE THIS MONTH. TO DEVELOP BUT THE TEMPLATE AND THE GUIDANCE TO SUPPORT ELEAZAR IN THERE AT THE U. K. IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING THIS CD EIGHT DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS TO ENGAGE WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS COUNTY PARTNERS AND LOCAL IMPLEMENTORS A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL OF US WHO HELPED. US WITH THE TEMPLATE AND GUIDANCE. THIS PROCESS HOW THE C. INSURE THE TEMP AND COMPING IS RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL NEEDS AND SUPPORTS IMPLEMENTORS TO LEVERAGE EXISTING RESOURCES AND CREATE NEWPARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTATION. WE'VE ALSO HOSTED MULTIPLE U. P. K. AND P. THREE WEBINARS SWITCHING OVER A THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS WITH EACH EMPHASIZING TO LIAISE THE IMPORTANT IMPORTANCE OF PROTEIN UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTNER UTK IN A U. K. FRAME. WHERE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM HEAD START OTHER PRIVATE OKAY AND- EXPANDED LEARNING PROVIDE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH A TRULY UNIVERSAL AND INCLUSIVE ACCESS. TO A FULL DAY OF BOTH RICH AND JOYFUL LEARNING. AND IF NEEDED XTENDED LEARNING CARE. YOU BEAT IT PROVIDES US WITH THE TRULY INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO THE PICNIC IT LAKS MANTA WE ARE SERVING AS A STATE. AS WE LOOK AT THE DATA FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THERE WERE OVER AND MILLION THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN BUT LESS THAN A THIRD OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER PUBLIC PRE K. OR SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE. WE ALSO FIND THE CALIFORNIA LACKS THE LICENSED CAPACITY TO MEET CHILDREN AND FAMILIES NEED WITH JUST UNDER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSE SPACES FOR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH TO AGE TWELVE. DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE DEMANDS FOR NON PARENTAL CARE. WHEN WE LOOK MORE DEEPLY AT THE S. P. P. SPECIFICALLY WE KNOW THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ELIGIBLE THAT ARE ENROLLED IS VERY LOW IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. STATE PRESCHOOL HAD FORTY THOUSAND ENROLLED THREE YEAR OLD CHILDREN OUT OF OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLDS. THAT'S ONLY 13% OF ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLD SIR. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT AGAIN ONLY 13% OF ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLD CHILDREN WERE SERVED AND THAT REPRESENTS 8% OF ALL THREE YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SERVE NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED IN TWO THOUSAND OUT OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN ELIGIBLE OR. 32% OF ELIGIBLE FOUR YEAR OLDS. EVEN IF FOR YEAR OLD SIR IN OUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAM PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD AND ALL OF THOSE CURRENT A HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND SPACES WENT INSTEAD TO ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLDS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLD CHILDREN THREE IRON THREE THOUSAND WAS MORE THAN TWICE THE TOTAL OF STATE PRESCHOOL ENROLLMENT FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IN SERVING THOSE ELIGIBLE. U. P. K. PROVIDES AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY PRE K. THE YEAR BEFORE KINDERGARTEN. AND TO THE EXTENT FAMILIES WHO PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE ENROLLED THEIR CHILDREN AND OTHER STATE AND FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS CHOOSE TKA. THAT MEANS WE CAN INCREASE THIS YEAR THREE YEAR OLD CHILDREN SERVED IN OUR PROGRAMS AND POTENTIALLY EVEN TO YOUR OLD CHILDREN. CALIFORNIA IS NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE TO SERVING ALL AS A LITTLE PRESCHOOLERS AND HIGH QUALITY PRE K. EXPERIENCE. IN THIS INVESTMENT IN A GETS US MUCH CLOSER. TO FURTHER THIS DENTIST SERVING CHILDREN WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED ELEAZAR TO PLAN FOR HOW THEY WILL BE CREATING MORE CAPACITY I'M NOT CREE QUE RATHER THAN MOVING CHILDREN FROM ONE PROGRAM TO ANOTHER. AND WE THINK THE FACILITY FUNDS FROM LAST YEAR THAT WENT TO THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION ALONG WITH ANY YOUR FACILITY INVESTMENTS ARE KEY TO THIS EFFORT.BECAUSE THE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT PLANNING TO BUILD OUT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR U. P. K. SUCH AS THE TEACHER PIPELINE AND FACILITIES WE ARE FRAMING OUR CURRENT EFFORTS AS AN INITIAL PLAN. AND ARE EXPECTING ELEAZAR TO MAKE UPDATES OVER THE ISSUE HERE IS THEY DIVE DEEPER INTO YOU PK AND DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR ON GOING IMPLEMENTATION ME. WE'VE ALSO BEEN HARD AT WORK TO RELEASE THE FUNDS TO SUPPORT U. P. K. EXPANSION. WE RELEASED THE ESTIMATES FOR THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION U. P. K. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS IN DECEMBER. AND REVISE THIS RECENTLY WITH SOME UPDATED DATA THOSE ARE GOING OUT THROUGH THE APPORTIONMENT PROCESS. SECOND AB RECENTLY RECEIVED FOUR HUNDRED ELIGIBLE LETTERS OF INTENT FOR THE A HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE EARLY EDUCATION TEACHER DEVELOPMENT GRANT. AND WILL BE REALLY THINK THAT REQUEST FOR APPLICATION SHORTLY. AS WE LOOK TO THE NEXT YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION WE KNOW HOW CRITICAL WILL BE BASED ON THE RESEARCH TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL ADULT IN THE CLASSROOM WE WERE PLEASED TO SEE THAT INVESTMENT IN IMPLEMENTING LAST YEAR'S VICTORY- AGREEMENT. RESEARCH SUPPORTS THAT MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE TEACHER CHILD RATIOS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN GREATLY IMPACTS THE ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT LOWER STAFF CHILD RATIOS TEND TO BE LESS STRESSFUL FOR TEACHERS WHICH CAN LEAD TO A MORE EMOTIONALLY SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN. SECOND LOWER STAFF CHILD RATIOS ALLOW FOR MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION WHICH CAN INCREASE CHILDREN'S OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION. AND LASTLY LOWERS STAFF CHILD RATIOS HAVE CONSISTENTLY AND POSITIVELY RELATED TO MEASURES OF CLASSROOM QUALITY. NINETEEN AN ADDITIONAL ADULT IN THE TICKET CLASSROOM WE ALSO BE A CRITICAL STRATEGY FOR ELLIE A PARTNERSHIPS WITH STATE PRESCHOOL AS WELL AS FOR SUPPORTING INTERNET AND RESIDENCY BASED TEACHER PIPELINE SOLUTION. DISTAFF T. K. WITH FULLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS IN OUT YEARS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND STABILIZE THE STAFFING SHORTAGES EXACERBATED BY COOK AT NINETEEN WE WOULD RECOMMEND REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE ALL ADULTS WORKING IN U. P. K. HAS SPECIFIC EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT UNITS AS WELL AS ONGOING PD. FINALLY WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ALLEY ACE THAT WHILE THEY FULLY SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF TKA IN IMPLEMENTATION OF U. P. K. THEY COULD USE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND A FEW KEY AREAS THAT POTENTIALLY IMPACT THE FEAST AND REPROACH. INCLUDING WORKING ON THEIR DIVERSE TEACHER PIPELINE STAFF ADEQUATE STAFFING TEEKAY AND OTHER GREAT. THIS INCLUDES WAYS TO ADDRESS KEY THREE ARE PRE K. TO THIRD GRADE AND PATHWAYS FOR THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. LUCKILY FOR ALL OF US THE COMMISSION I TEACHER CREDENTIALING UNDER MERRY SANDY'S DIRECTION IS ALREADY ENGAGED IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN. WHERE THIS THERE IS ALL A NEED TO WITH. PARK INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO ALSO CHANGE AND MORE QUICKLY ADAPT AND SUPPORT COURSES AND PATHWAYS. SEE MORE CREDENTIALED AND PERMITTED TEACHERS EMPOWER EDUCATORS. R. ELLIE IS ALSO HAVE FACILITY NEEDS INCLUDING PLAYGROUND BATHROOMS PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION AND FINALLY FINALLY AS HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED TO DO FULL UTK EXPANSION IMMEDIATELY IN ORDER TO HAVE ENOUGH STUDENTS TO CREATE A CLASSROOM WHILE OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE FACILITY AND TEACHER PIPELINE. NEEDS THAT THEY CAN NOT ACCOMPLISH THE QUICKLY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TESTIFIED TODAY AND I HAVE SOME OF MY TEAM HERE IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. OKAY THINK YOU'LL COME BACK TO YOU IN IN THE SACK THAT WE NOW HAVE THE REPRESENTED FROM LA A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE MORNING CHURCH MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. UNIVERSITY KAITLYN TATIAN IT'S A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE GRATEFUL TO OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS FOR THIS INVESTMENT AND I'M HUMBLED TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING IN THE FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. FIRST I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THIS WORK IS OCCURRING FRESNO UNIFIED HAS A STUDENT POPULATION. OF SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE STUDENTS. 88% OF OUR POPULATION ARE LIVING IN DISADVANTAGED CIRCUMSTANCES. FRESNO OPERATES FOLD ATK CLASSROOMS AT SIXTY THREE OUT OF SIXTY SIX ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WE PROVIDE WITH A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AT FIFTY SEVEN SCHOOL SITES AND SIX INFANTS TO SCHOOL AGE CENTER BASED CHILD CARE CENTERS. OUR SUPERINTENDENT AND BOARD PAST AND PRESENT ARE FULLY ENGAGED AND INVESTED IN OUR EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS AS A STRATEGY TO HELP CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WHAT YOU. CAN BURKE. YOU CAN TELL FROM OUR DATA IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN OUR DISTRICT TO DEVELOP A STRONG CONTINUUM OF LEARNING FOR CHILDREN THIS WORK INCLUDES A ROBUST AN INTENTIONAL FOCUS OF RESOURCES IN CROSS SECTOR WORK ADMINISTRATOR EFFECTIVENESS. EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS INSTRUCTIONAL TOOLS LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS IT DRIVEN IMPROVEMENT AND ENGAGING FAMILIES. AND IN FACT WE ARE BRINGING KHRISTICH OURS HERE TO HELP US AUDIT HOW WE'RE DOING IN THOSE AT FIRST. THROUGH GRANTS FROM THE DAVID AND LUCILE PACKARD FOUNDATION AND AN EARLY EDGE WE'VE HAD THE OCCASION TO TEST AND LEARN USING INNOVATIVE PRACTICES IN THE THIRTY FIVE SPACE OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS INCLUDING OUR LOCAL RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCY CHILDREN SERVICES NETWORK. AND START FRESNO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS DEVELOP STRONG PARTNERSHIPS IN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF YOUNG TO LEARN LANGUAGE LEARNERS FROM INFANTS THROUGH PRESCHOOL. THESE PARTNERSHIPS ARE GROUNDED IN THE BELIEF THAT THE COLLECTIVE COMMUNITY WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE FOCUS ON EARLY LEARNING HAS CEDED THE GROUND- FOR UNIVERSAL T. K. LIMITATION AND FRESNO. AND THOUGH WE ARE POINTING. THE CHICKENS PRACTICALLY NOTHING MAKING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH INCREASING SERVICES FOR CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE. WE KNOW THAT WE CANNOT LOOK AT TJ SEPARATE FROM INFANTS TO THREE YEAR OLDS AND KINDERGARTEN TO THIRD GRADE WITH THAT IN MIND WE'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR UTK WITHIN THE BROADER WORK ABOUT BIRTH TO THIRD GRADE SYSTEM. UTK OFFERS A NEW OPENING FOR SERVING MORE CHILDREN IN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THE DIFFERENCE THE STARTING EARLIER PROVIDING TWO YEARS OF QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS HAS A GREATER IMPACT ON LONG TERM SUCCESS.THE OTHERS HAVE SPOKEN TODAY IT SYSTEM CHANGE DOES NOT COME WITHOUT CHALLENGES. THERE HAVE BEEN DEEP CONVERSATIONS AROUND FACILITY CHALLENGES. THESE CHALLENGES CAN BE OVERCOME HOWEVER. THERE ARE CONCERNS ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC WITH COMPETING NEEDS FOR CLASSROOM SPACES STUDENTS ARE COMING BACK TO SCHOOL WITH ADDITIONAL SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES AND THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE SPACES FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT THAT'S COOL WE APPRECIATE THE FACILITY FOR COMING SOON HOWEVER THE NEED IS HIGHER THAN THE FUNDS PROVIDED CONSTRUCTION COST IS VERY HIGH RIGHT NOW. AND THE COST OF MODULAR SYNTH DOUBLED TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WILL TAKE SIX TO TEN MINUTES TO OBTAIN WE KNOW THAT DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PRACTICE CALLS FOR APPROPRIATE SETTINGS WE NEED AN INFUSION OF DOLLARS TO HELP DISTRICTS CONSTRUCT RENOVATE OR PURCHASE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE FACILITIES WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE IN YOUR DOLLARS DO NOT ARE US FROM PURCHASING PORTABLE OR MODULAR. TO MEET THE NEEDS SOCIAL. YOUR SOCIAL AND- PRO PRO PROGRAM AND EARLY LEARNING PRO. AS PART OF OUR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION EFFORTS IN THE WORK FORCE WE ARE FACING CHALLENGES IN MEETING THE AUGUST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE DEADLINE FOR CREDENTIALED TEACHERS TO OBTAIN THEIR TWENTY FOUR YOU SEE UNITS. FUNDS OR GRANTS FOR TEACHERS TO PAY THOSE UNITS FOR FAKE PAY FOR THOSE UNITS AND FLEXIBILITY ON AUGUST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE DEADLINE IF NEEDED. AS YOU HEARD PRESCHOOL TEACHERS. ALWAYS TOP FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE ESPECIALLY FACING CHALLENGES IT'S ME WITH EXTREME. IN THE NEED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL INTERNET CREDENTIAL WE DO HAVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION FOR INTERN PROGRAMS. BUT WE NEED ADDITIONAL TIME TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION BOTH AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL SPECIFIC TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. WITH ARE YOU TAKE A IMPLEMENTATION PLAN DO IN JUST A FEW MONTHS IT WILL pBE CHALLENGING TO GET THE MESSAGE TO ALL COMMUNITY PARTNERS. THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SERVING MORE YOUNGER CHILDREN HOWEVER IT WILL NOT BE A LOSS TO ANY PROGRAM. WILL BE A BENEFIT FOR CHILDREN. I WAS SO EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT THAT I TRIPLE E. P. EXPANSION FOR MS LIEBERMAN. THIS IS A HIGH NEED AREA IN IN WITH EVERY DISTRICT. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND I. TRIPOLI P. GRANT FOR INCLUSION HAS HELPED FRESNO UNIFIED MOVED FROM ONE INCLUDES ADDING THE SIXTEEN IN TWO SHORT YEARS. THIS IS BEEN A HUGE LIFT DURING A PANDEMIC AND AS A SHIFT FOR OUR EDUCATORS. AS A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PRACTICE THERE IS A CONCERN AROUND BOTH CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT. TEEKAY WITH MISCHIEF BASED ON THE BELIEF THAT KINDERGARTEN IS NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF YOUNGER CHILDREN. IN A DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE APPROACH AND NOW IT'S TO CONSERVING EVEN YOUNGER CHILDREN THE NEED FOR GUIDANCE ON DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS NEEDED FOR EDUCATORS TEACHERS. THEIR SYSTEMS AND SITE ADMINISTRATORS FRESNO UNIFIED. HAS DEVELOPED AN EARLY LEARNING PRINCIPLE ACADEMY UTILIZING FIRST FIVE GRANT FUNDING BUT WE WERE NOT UNABLE TO CONTINUE THAT WORK WITHOUT FUNDING. AS WE CONTINUE. TO DEVELOP A COHESIVE PRESCHOOL TO THIRD GRADE I TOLD WITH THEM. IT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS TO HELP FLEXIBILITY IN THE C. S. P. P. STATUTE ON ENROLLMENT. PARENTS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN PRE REGISTERING THEIR TEACHING CANDOR AGE SCHOOL CHILDREN WE BEGAN EARLY THIS YEAR TO GET A BETTER PROJECTION FOR TEEKAY THIS COMING SCHOOL YEAR PRESCHOOL PARENTS COULD NOT BEGIN THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. UNTIL LATER BECAUSE OF STATUTE AROUND CERTIFICATION. THIS CAUSES FRUSTRATION IN Q. AND CONFUSION FOR PARENTS. IT DID NOT TAKE IT FOR WHEN ROLL PRESCHOOL CHILDREN BUT ALSO FOR HARDSHIP FOR PARENTS BUT THAT MAY BE ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOUR THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND AGAIN. WE APPRECIATE THIS HISTORIC LEGISLATION AND INVESTMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU I'LL NOW TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ALL HAVE SOME BUT FIRST WE'LL TURN TO OUR MAJORITY LEADER ASSEMBLY MEMBER S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO BEGIN BY. THANKING YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK. TO MAKE THIS DREAM COME TRUE OF UNIVERSAL. TEEKAY IT WAS A LONG TIME IN THE MAKING AND PLANNING AND I SINCERELY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THAT AND YOUR ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS MAKING SURE THAT WE TOOK CARE. OF ALL OF OUR FOUR YEAR OLDS- I BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE STATISTICS THAT ARE BEING SHARED- THE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED ELEAZAR SUBMITTED LETTERS OF INTENT FOR THIS TEACHER PREPARATION. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION THAT IS BEING THAT IS BEING PROVIDED FOR THAT. AND I WANT TO BE SURE THAT ARE ELLIE AS- I FEEL THAT THEY DO HAVE THE CAPACITY AND CAN CONTINUE TO APPLY AND MAYBE WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR SOME FUNDING. IN THE OUT YEARS AFTER THE PANDEMIC THE STATE PLANNING FUNDS- SPECIFICALLY ALLOW ELEAZAR TO PARTNER WITH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY BASED PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS. SO MY QUESTION IS R. ELLIE AS WORKING AND PLANNING. FOR THIS UNIVERSITY K. WITH OUR PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS. DID YOU WANT THAT CALIFORNIA. YES. SORRY IT WAS THE THING WE KNOW WOULD PROBABLY GO TO ME YES THEY ARE NEVER MARKING CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT THE AS FAR AS WE KNOW I'M IT'S A MIX SO THERE'S A LOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN EDUCATION AS YOU ALL KNOW AND JUST LIKE THE SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE CHILD CARE WORLD OUR TEACHERS OUR ADMINISTRATORS ARE DEALING WITH A LOT OF VARIOUS NEEDS INCLUDING RISK CONTINUING TO RESPOND TO THE STATUS THAT THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SO WITH THAT PLANNING THEY HAVE ALL BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN OUR WEBINARS THEY HAVE THEIR DIVING INTO THE GUIDANCE THERE'S A LOT THERE AND SOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY STARTED THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND PLANNING WE ALSO KNOW THAT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WHO ALSO ARE RECEIVING FUNDS FOR THIS ARE GETTING TOGETHER AND SUPPORTING THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SOME OF THAT PLANNING WE DID HAVE A RECENTWEBINAR I THINK IT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO AT THAT ADDRESS THE COMMUNITY PLANNING PIECE. OF THE GUIDANCE AS A WAY TO MAKE SURE WE WERE SHARING VERBALLY NOT JUST WITH THE WRITTEN GUIDANCE WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN AND HOW THEY COULD MOVE FORWARD WE ARE ALSO PARTYING WITH THAT AND CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE ON EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE AS WELL AS THEY COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING. FOR THIS TO HAPPEN ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU I COULDN'T AS WE MOVE FORWARD I DO WANT TO SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THE- STATE CAN DO. TO HELP SUPPORT OUR PRESCHOOL SYSTEMS AS THEY ADAPT TO OUR TRANSITION TO UTK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WANNA FOLLOW UP ON THOSE QUESTIONS FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES SANTIAGO LIAISING YOU MENTIONED EARLIER- SERRA FROM CD ABOUT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN FLEXIBILITY AND I KNOW IF YEARS AGO WEEKLY- ADDED A CLAUSE INTO THE STATE LAW ALLOWED DISTRICTS TO EXPAND T. K. AND THEN ROLL STUDENTS EARLIER THAN THEY WERE ELIGIBLE TECHNICALLY BUT THEY'D HAVE TO ESSENTIALLY. EAT THE MONEY UNTIL THAT KID TURNED FIVE AND THAT YOU KNOW LA IN A BUNCH OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE UTILIZED THAT AS WE ROLL OUT. TEEKAY AND OF COURSE IT'S NOT EVEN LAW UNTIL JULY ONE SOME DISTRICTS LIKE SAN DIEGO WE'VE HEARD IS GOING ALL IN. THEY'RE GOING TO STATE THAT THEY THINK IT'S EASIER TO JUST DO IT ALL AT ONCE- DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS- FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW DISTRICTS TO COLLECT. EIGHTY EIGHT EARLIER TO ALLOW SOME WHO WANT TO DO EARLY ADOPTION. OR IS HOW WE LAID OUT LAST YEAR SUFFICIENT. I THINK IT'S THEIR NOVEL MORGAN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR AND WE AS SPECIALLY THOSE ARE PEARL COMMUNITIES THAT THEY COULD USE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO OPEN UP A FULL CLASSROOM NOW. AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT AND ME AND WOULD NEED THAT IT DOES EIGHTY EIGHT FUNDS TO BE PART OF THAT AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME OTHER DISTRICTS ESPECIALLY SOME LARGER ONES THAT THEY MIGHT NEED MORE TIME. TO ADDRESS THE FAITH THEN BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON THEIR FACILITIES AND TRYING TO BUILD THAT WORK FORCE OUT I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL OF OUR ALLEY AS- SAME THING IS IN THE CHILD CARE WORLD THAT THE TEACHER EDUCATOR PIPELINE. CONTINUES TO NEED SUPPORT AND WHILE IT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT TO EVERYBODY ELSE WE THOUGHT FOUR HUNDRED LETTERS OF INTENT WAS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. AND- I'LL OF THOSE- COMING TOGETHER AS THE CONSORTIUMS THAT WE HAVE SOME FROM COUNTY OFFICES OF BAD WITH THEIR THAN PULLING TOGETHER AND SUPPORTING OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE WILL NOTE THAT EDUCATOR PIPELINE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR A WHILE NOW IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT THE CODE NINETEEN DEFINITELY HAS EXACERBATED THE AMOUNT OF TEACHERS THAT HAVE LEFT THIS FIELD AND ONLY GROWN HOW MANY MORE TEACHERS AND OTHER STAFF ARE NEEDED TO COME IN. SO ENSURING THAT THERE ARE ON GOING SUPPORT. AND DIFFERENT PIPELINES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IS ALWAYS A CRITICAL PART OF THAT. SOME OF THAT MAY BE A CAPACITY ISSUE AS WELL SO GOING BACK TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER RACIST COMMENT WE DO THINK THAT IT IS HARD FOR SOME ELEAZAR AND OTHERS TO ACTUALLY APPLY FOR FRIENDS BECAUSE OF THE ALL THE COMPETING CAPACITY NEEDS. AND WOULD ALSO LOOK TO OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT THEM. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THOSE THAT ARE JOINING TOGETHER IS THE CONSORTIUM TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CAPACITY ISSUES. SO IT IS. IT IS THAT A YES OR NO THAT WE NEED TO. TO CHANGE THE LAW TO ALLOW. EIGHTY TWO DISTRICTS TO START COLLECTING EIGHTY EIGHT MEDIALLY. WE WOULD RECOMMENDS THAT SCHOOLS DISTRICTS ARE READY WOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT EIGHTY EIGHT FOR THOSE STUDENTS AS WELL AND WE ALSO I WANT TO FLAG AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE HEARD THAT SOMEONE TO SERVE CHILDREN WITH SUMMER BIRTHDATE AND THE JULY FIRST TO SEPTEMBER FIRST BIRTHDAYS AREN'T COVERED IN STATUE INTO FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. BUDGET OKAY. BURKE SHERMAN APARTMENT YEAH. YEAH CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW NOTE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR AT THE GAMES TO CLAIM ADDITIONAL ADA FOR THOSE COHORTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PLANNED FOR FUTURE YEARS THERE WOULD BE GENERAL FUND IMPACT BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT CHANGE THE B. BENCH AND- FIFTY EIGHT WOULD. CHANGE THE RETENTION SCHEDULE SO THAT WOULD BE GENERAL FUND IMPACT. YEAH THAT SHOULD BE A LONG TERM ISSUE BECAUSE EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE ANYWAY THAT YOU KNOW THROUGH THE STAKE AT DIFFERENT. TIME I WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU I THAT YOU KNOW IN THE LONG TERM WE WOULD ULTIMATELY GET THERE BUT THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL COST IN THE INTERVENING YEARS THE PUT UP WOULD BE SCHEDULED INTO THE GUARANTEE IS PART THAT REVENGE. OKAY WELL THANK YOU I KNOW I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE HEAR A LOT THAT- THE YOU'RE MAKING THESE GREAT CHANGES IN EARLY EDUCATION WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC CHANGE IS HARD AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND SO- YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE RECORDED AS BEST AS WE CAN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AND PROVIDE MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESS- ALSO KNOW WE HAVE WORK TO DO IN THIS ZERO THREE THREE SPACE AS WE NOTED EARLIER. BUT THIS IS- THAT AN ABSOLUTES- PRIORITY AND YOU KNOW I THINK A GAME CHANGER FOR CALIFORNIA THAT AS THAT SERRA NUMBER MORGAN FILTERED EARLIER THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS ON WAITING LISTS TO DON'T HAVE ELIGIBILITY AND THE YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHO MAYBE THEY CAN PAY FOR IT NOW BUT YOU KNOW RENT IS SO HIGH COSTS ARE SO HIGH INFLATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE GAS PRICES IT'S- HARD TO PAY. BETWEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED ON THE LOW END AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HERE AND SOME OF THAT SOME OF THE URBAN MORE HIGH COST AREAS RIGHT CALIFORNIA PER MONTH. FOR PRE K. FOR FOUR YEAR OLD MAN WHO CAN AFFORD THAT YOU KNOW. IT'S MORE THAN IT COST TO GO TO UC BERKELEY. TO GO TO A- PRIVATE PRESCHOOL SO THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP- MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND AGAIN. YOU KNOW. ALL THE MONEY THAT WE CURRENTLY SPEND FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS. I THINK IF WE SPENT THAT TO HELP MORE. OF HIGH QUALITY EARLY AT BEFORE PRE K. BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT JUST- SOMETHING WE CAN SAY WE NEED TO PUT. OUR RESOURCES AND OUR YOU KNOW THE WEIGHT OF OUR STATE BUDGET OUR POLICY BEHIND THAT SO WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING. JUST THAT A QUESTION ON MORE TO THAT THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF T. K. AND THE FUNDING FOR FACILITIES- YOU KNOW THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT I HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR WHEN I TALKED TO- SCHOOL DISTRICTS ENTITIES ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION AS WORKFORCE. AND FACILITIES SO CAN WE ASK- CD AND- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A LEYVA WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER OR EVEN THE FRESNO- UNIFIED FOLKS. ABOUT THE MONEY WE PUT IN FOR YOU TAKE A FACILITIES AND IS THAT ENOUGH TO NEED TO DO MORE WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO DO ON THIS FRONT. LISA SILVERMAN ON THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. AT WHAT WE HAVE- FOR WITH A FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION. OF THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD DID ANNOUNCED TWO FUNDING ROUNDS SO JUST TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE THAT OF THE FIRST FAMILY AROUND WILL BEGIN IN APRIL FIRST OF THIS YEAR AND CLOSE APRIL THIRTITH OF THIS YEAR. AND THEY'LL BE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE. FOR THE PURPOSE. AND SO THAT EXTENT- THAT WILL BE THE FIRST FAMILY AROUND. AND THEN WE ALSO TO ESTABLISH THAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT READY TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATION FOR THE SITE EXTEND THE PROGRAM. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO FILE. FOR PROGRAM FUNDS OUT OF THE REMAINING FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION- THAT THEY WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ON APRIL FIRST. OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- AND THAT. ALSO CLOSE ON APRIL THIRTIETH SO AGAIN. WE'RE FORWARD TO HAVE A- ROBUST PROGRAM FOR THE FOR BALLING AROUND AND OUT THIS. WE NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THE NEED IS SO- IF IT'S COMPARED TO THE LAST- PROGRAM WE HAD FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION. YES WE WOULD DEFINITELY OVERSUBSCRIBED I'M SO WE DEFINITELY WILL. KEEP TRACK OF ALL THE OPTIONS. THAT COME THROUGH THE DOOR AND BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH THE FUTURE. NOW AGAIN REMIND ME IS THERE ARE THERE IS THERE A MATCH REQUIREMENT HERE THIS IS JUST ELIGIBILITY- COMPONENT SO IF YOU ARE A DISTRICT- THAT HATCH DEMONSTRATES A FINANCIAL PURCHASE. YOU ESTABLISH FIFTY POINTS OR HIGHER CRITERIA. AND IT IS ALSO BASED ON A FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH SO YOU COULD. JUST YOU COULD RECEIVE UP TO A HUNDRED PERCENT. OF THE PROJECT FUNDED- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE- OTHER MATCH YOUR REQUIREMENTS- IF YOU DON'T MEET THAT THRESHOLD AND- THERE IS A- COULD BE A FIFTY FIFTY MATCH. WHEN IT COMES TO- EXTEND YOUR FULL THEY CAN- PROGRAM. AND THERE'S ALSO A CITY FIVE TWENTY FIVE MATCH. FOR THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND PRESCHOOL- AS WELL AS A FOR A FULL DAY PROGRAM SO. AGAIN IF VERY- DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PROGRAM AND THE- THE CRITERIA WHICH THE- DISTRICT. ITSELF SO WE SENSUALLY FLAX THIS SO IT'S FULL DAY. KINDERGARTEN IN E. U. T. K. AS ONE. DO WE- AND I KNOW YOU WERE. IN THAT JUST ABOUT READY TO GIVE OUT. THE FIRST ROUND OF TWO YEARS OF- THAT. AWARDS DO WE SEE THAT THE MAJORITY IS YOU T. HER FULL DAY CAN. WHAT THE MAX. WELL AT THIS TIME THE FAMILY AROUND OPEN APRIL SO WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED APPLICATIONS YET- SO THE STATE OCCASION BOARD THE STAFF THE FINE ROUND SO WILL MORE IN. IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS AND THE GROUND THAT'S CLOSE SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CORRECT. BASED UPON OUR KNOWLEDGE FROM THE- WE HAD THAT CHUNK OF MY FOR FULL DAY. KINDERGARTEN AND THERE WASN'T MUCH OF AN APPETITE SO I ASSUME THAT THAT. THAT THE FOCUS HERE WILL BE- THE UNIVERSITY K. FACILITIES. WELL THEY- SORRY WAS PRIOR PROGRAM WITH THE PRIOR PROGRAM WAS ONLY FOR FULL THAT CAN I'M SO WE DIDN'T USE THAT LIFE DOESN'T TAKE COMP ANALYSIS THAT. I WILL BE NEEDED AS MUCH AND SO THE YOU TO WILL BE THE PRIMARY. WHICH- I THINK MAKES SENSE BASED BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA OVER HEARING. CAN I ASK. YES THIS IS DEANNA MATHIS FROM FRESNO UNIFIED- WE ARE PROJECTING TO NEED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL CLASSROOMS THROUGHOUT THE FOUR YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION ADDITIONAL CLASSROOMS ARE SOME OF THOSE CONVERSION FIVE YEAR CLASSROOMS AT SITES WHERE YOU HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND UNDER UTILIZED CLASSROOMS. I'M EITHER ADDITIONAL CLASSROOMS AND WHILE WE HAVE NOT A MOMENT- THERE ARE MORE SUPPORTS NEEDED AT SCHOOL SITES SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORTS AND ASK THOSE PEOPLE GO TO SCHOOL SITES THEY NEED ROOMS TO DO THE WORK. SO IT'S SORT OF A COMPETITION OVER FACILITIES BUT IT IS AN AREA OF DEEP DISCUSSION. OKAY CAN WE SWITCH NOW TO TALK ABOUT- THE ISSUE OF THE WORK FORCE IN TEACHERS AND PROFESSIONALS. WE ASK SERRA DOUBLE MORGAN PROVIDE ANY INSIGHT ON FOR THE L. A. O. OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT WE NEED TO DO ON THIS FRONT TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH STAFFING NEEDS. AND GRANTED THIS IS NOT IMMEDIATE FOR THIS YEAR- OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. WHO WANTS TO ANSWER. THAT NUMBER MARKING CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'M HAPPY TO START IT AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE MERRY'S THING INDEED THAT DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING HERE AS WELL SHE IS FAR MORE OF AN EXPERT IN ALL OF THIS THEN I AM SO ALSO HAPPY TO TAG HER INTO MY PHONE A FRIEND SAID THAT SHE CAN ADDRESS MORE OF IT. BUT WE HEAR PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NEEDS FROM OUR ELEAZAR AND OUR CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. AROUND NEEDING MORE. HI MORE SUPPORT. AND NOT STUDY STREAM OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED EDUCATORS AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY TESTIMONY THIS IS SPEND SOMETHING THAT HAD SPEND ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA FOR QUITE AWHILE. WE HAVE HAD A LACK OF DIVERSE TEACHERS AND ENSURING THAT THE TEACHERS REALLY REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED MORE BILINGUAL TEACHERS WHO CAN ENSURE THAT WE HAVE MULTI LINGUAL PROGRAMS. AND WE NEED MORE TEACHERS WHO CAN SUPPORT OUR CHILDREN STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. SO NOW WITH THIS WILL NEED MORE TKA TEACHERS WHO BOTH HAVE THAT TEACHER CREDENTIAL AS WELL AS TRULY UNDERSTAND DEVELOPMENT AND HOW TO SUPPORT PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. IN THE ALLEY A STUDY SO THAT CREATES ANOTHER NEED ON THERE AND WE WOULD STAY AS THEY EXPANDED T. K. WE'RE HOPING THAT MORE OF THEM. NOT ONLY ARE DIVERSE BUT ARE BILINGUAL SO WE CAN EXPAND THE NUMBER OF BILINGUAL PROGRAMS STARTING IN STATE PRESCHOOL AND T. K. AND THEN ALSO CAN SUPPORT INCLUSION SO HAVE THAT GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF WORKING WITH STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET THERE WERE SEVERAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDING IN OUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS WHERE YOU CAN HAVE PATHWAYS WERE CURRENT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS CAN ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND ACTUALLY HAVE DUAL ENROLLMENT. THERE WERE ALSO PLANS TO ADDRESS TEACHER RESIDENCIES. AND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT THE REQUEST FOR FUNDING APPLICATIONS ON THAT HAS CLOSED- IS STILL OPEN BUT THAT REALLY IS A GROW YOUR OWN. AND A VERY MUCH NEEDED MODEL BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT IS THAT NEED TO SPARK OUR INSTITUTES OF HIGHER EDUCATION AS WELL. BECAUSE THESE PATHWAYS HAVE TO BE CREATED PRETTY QUICKLY AND THE. TYPICAL PROP. HIGHER EDUCATION CAN TAKE IT LEAST TWO YEARS TO GET THROUGH NEW COURSE SAYS AND- COURSE CORRECTIONS ALL OF THOSE PIECES THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY. IN ORDER TO EXPAND AND TRULY CAPITALIZE BOTH ON OUR TEACHERS WHO HAVE A CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. AS WELL AS OUR TEACHERS WHO ALREADY HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL AS WELL THIRD CREATING A WHOLE NEW WORK FORCE SO I WOULD TAPPED MARY WHO WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SHARE MORE WITH YOU THAN I CAN OKAY THANK YOU. AND MERRY AS AS YOU'RE GEARING UP SUGGEST ENLIGHTEN US WITH SOLUTIONS WE KNOW PROBLEMS AND WHERE THEY CAN MAKE. WE TRY TO BE THE SOLUTION ENTITY HERE SO. HELP US HELP YOU THOSE SHOES FOR YOU ON THIS RECORDED. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU A SERRA- THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU SAID SUCH A GREAT STAGE FOR ALL OF THIS- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF BUILDING A NEW A RETOOLING AND EXISTING EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIALIST CREDENTIAL IT WILL BE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SERVE. CHILDREN AGES THREE TO EIGHT THROUGH SO PRESCHOOL THROUGH THIRD GRADE WE EXPECT TO HAVE THE COMMISSION TAKE ACTION ON THIS CREDENTIAL AND DO STANDARDS FOR PREPARATION LEADING TO THAT CREDENTIAL AS EARLY AS JUNE OF THIS YEAR THAT'S OUR GOAL AND THEN WE'LL GO THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS I'VE- OUR OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS PATHWAY WILL WILL WILL WILL CREATE MULTIPLE ACCESSIBLE. ROUTES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY WORKING IN THE FIELD EITHER AS A MULTIPLE SUBJECT TEACHER OR AS A CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT HOLDERS SERVING IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL OR ELSEWHERE- TO EXPEDITE THEIR OF THE COMPLETION OF A PROGRAM THAT LEADS TO THIS CREDENTIAL WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE ENROLLMENT IN PROGRAMS BEGINNING AS EARLY AS NEXT YEAR FOUR. FOUR EIGHT INSTITUTIONS THAT I THINK ARE VERY EAGER TO BEGIN OFFERING THIS PATHWAY WERE FOR THE FUTURE SECOND SHORTER TERM IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM THE ONLY POTENTIAL THAT IS AUTHORIZED TO SERVE IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IS A MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL AND ACCORDING TO THE APPORTIONMENT FUNDING PROVISIONS THAT MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL HOLDER NEEDS TO HAVE TWENTY FOUR UNITS FOUR INEQUIVALENT. AS DETERMINED BY THEIR EMPLOYER FOUR I HOLDING A CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT THAT IS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS PREPARING THEM FOR THAT- SO THIS IS THE CHALLENGE THAT IS BEFORE US AND IN THE IN THE ABSENCE OF ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF MULTIPLE SUBJECT TEACHERS WHO WOULD REQUIREMENTS THERE ARE OTHER STAFFING OPTIONS AVAILABLE INTERN PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING TOWARD A CREDENTIAL. PROVISIONAL INTERN. PERMITS SHORT TERM STAFF BIG PERMITS WE THE OPTION ARE OF. TO FOR IMMEDIATE STAFF NEEDS AND- WHO IS THAT THE WHO BE A WILL OF THEMSELVES OF THE- OPTIONS AS THE MENU TO- WHILE WE'RE BUILDING. OTHER THE WORK FOR THAT THAT WILL. A READY SERVE THE SPACE- IN TERMS OF THE TWENTY FOUR WE HEARD LAST WEEK IN THE SENATE BUDGET HEARING FROM PLASTER COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE A- STRATEGY WHERE THEY ARE PLACING ALL OF THE OR INVITING ALL OF THEIR MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL HOLDERS. WITH AN INTEREST IN THIS TO- PARTICIPATE AS A COHORT. OTHER PARTNERING WITH THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE LOCALLY. TO PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM THAT ENABLES THEIR MULTIPLE SUBJECT TEACHERS TO MEET THE TWENTY FOUR UNIT REQUIREMENT AND GET THEMSELVES REALLY ON TRACK TO SERVE IN THESE CLASSROOMS. WE THINK THE KIND OF STRATEGY IS BRILLIANT CANNOT BE REPLICATED ACROSS ACROSS THE STATE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE OFFERING. OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF PREPARATION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SPACE AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT RESOURCE. GOING FORWARD AS WE AS WE RETOOL AND. UPSCALE OUR- THE ALL THE HER. THAT WE HAVE A VERY RIGHT NOW OUR A REALLY IDEA SUITED TO HELP. A LOCAL SCHOOL NEXT DISTRICTS GROWTH HER OWN ON FUTURE WORK FORCE THE RESIDENCY FUNDING. IN FACT I THINK IS IDEALLY SUITED FOR. TEEKAY CLASSROOMS IN PARTICULAR AS WE THINK ABOUT. THE SECOND ADULT IN THE CLASSROOM. GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILD PERMIT HOLDERS WHO ARE SEEKING A CREDENTIAL THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BE THE LEAD TEACHER IN THAT CLASSROOM. A RESIDENTS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR THEM TO DEVELOP THOSE SKILLS INTO SPEND THAT YEAR WITH HER COOPERATING TEACHER AND EARN THE CREDENTIAL TO BECOME PART OF THE WORKFORCE THAT'S THAT'S GROWING. OF FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO EARN A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE BEFORE THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD TOWARDS CREDENTIALING THE CLASSICAL CREDENTIALING PROGRAM GRANT IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT 88 DEGREES HOLDERS AS THEY COMPLETED DEGREE CREDENTIAL. SO WE'VE GOT SOME VERY IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE GRANTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT OF PEOPLE MOVING INTO AND THROUGH THE PIPELINE AND CREDENTIAL OPTIONS ON THE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR THE SHORT TERM AND ON DECK- COMING VERY SOON. TO ENABLE AN EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIALIST CREDENTIAL WE HOPE TO BECOME OF THE PREDOMINANT WAY IN WHICH WE STAFF CLASSROOMS. FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. I LOOK THIS IS OF SOME HELP. OKAY THANK YOU IT IS AND I KNOW THERE ARE NO. YOU KNOW EASY SIMPLE SOLUTIONS AND COURSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE LOWEST HANGING FRUIT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HEARING IN A FEW WEEKS ON THE OVERALL TEACHER PIPELINE ISSUE SO. WE'LL CERTAINLY- DIG INTO THIS A BIT MORE. I THINK THE- ALL FOR ME NO OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEND QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW THIS NOW- PROCEED TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE.

THIS IS WHY WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO ADOPT THE BUDGET THAT EXTENDS THESE POLICIES SUCH AS WEAVING FAMILY FEES THROUGH SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND PAYING PROVIDERS BASED ON FAMILY CERTIFIED NEED RATHER THAN ATTENDANCE WE ALSO URGE ADOPTION OF THE BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT INCREASES PROVIDER SUBSIDY PAID TO ADJUST LIVING WAGE AND INCREASES THE NUMBER OF VOUCHERS AS OUTLINED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AGREEMENT. THESE POLICIES ARE INTERDEPENDENT AND ADOPTING THEM WILL SERVE ALL FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA AND BE INCLUSIVE FOR WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM.
