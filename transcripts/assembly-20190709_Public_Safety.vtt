BASED ON THE FACTS.

00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:16.254
OF THE CASE OVER EXAMPLE AN

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:17.122
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD.

IS PROBABLY NOT VERY LIKELY TO

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.195
BE PUT ON THE REGISTRY TWENTY

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:25.797
FOUR YEAR OLD HAVING SEX WITH A

ON FOR EVERY OTHER FORM OF

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:34.672
INTERCOURSE.

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:36.808
A JUDGE IS MANDATED TO PUT THE

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:40.211
PERSON ON THE REGISTRY -- CANNOT

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:41.846
TAKE ANY OF THE FACTS OF THE

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:43.748
CASE INTO A CAL HAS NO

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:44.782
DISCRETION.

00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:46.317
I THE REASON FOR THIS

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:47.785
DISTINCTION WHICH IS BOTH

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:50.155
DISCRIMINATORY AND IRRATIONAL IS

00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:51.256
BECAUSE ON THE SEX OFFENDER

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:53.491
REGISTRY WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN

00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:56.094
FORTIES -- THE ONLY LEGAL FORM

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:57.462
OF INTERCOURSE WAS VAGINAL PL

00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:58.963
INTERCOURSE EVERYTHINGELSE WAS

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.398
BANNED -- SO WE HAVE THIS

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:02.800
BASICALLY LEFT OVER FROM THE

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:05.003
NINETEEN FORTIES -- AND THE

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:07.772
PROBLEM WITH THAT -- IS IT WHAT

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.674
IT MEANS.

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:11.042
IS THAT -- YOU HAVE

00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:13.344
IRRATIONALITY SO THE EIGHTEEN

00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:14.946
YEAR OLD HAS VAGINAL INTERCOURSE

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:15.847
OF THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:18.249
GIRLFRIEND THE JUDGE DOESN'T

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:19.417
HAVE TO PUT HIM ON THE REGISTRY.

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:21.619
BUT IF SHE PERFORMS ORAL SEX ON

00:30:21.686 --> 00:30:24.222
HIM -- I'M SORRY TO BE EXPLICIT

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:26.024
BUT THAT'S WHAT SIX HUNDRED

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.357
STREET ABOUT.

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:27.392
SHE PERFORMS ORAL SEX ON HIM THE

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:29.327
JUDGE MUST PUT HIM ON THE

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:31.462
REGISTRY THAT IS BEYOND

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:34.199
IRRATIONAL -- AND THE BILL ALSO

00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:36.100
OR EXCUSE ME THAT THIS STATE OF

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:37.135
THE LAW ALSO CREATES A

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:39.137
SIGNIFICANT DISCRIMINATION

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:40.972
AGAINST LGBT.

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.607
YOUNG PEOPLE -- WHO ARE MUCH

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:45.043
LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE

00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:46.211
AND -- VAGINAL PENILE

00:30:46.277 --> 00:30:48.379
INTERCOURSE -- AND SO WE ARE

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:50.915
SEEING -- YOUNG LGBT PEOPLE WHO

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:52.550
WERE BEING FORCED ON THE SEX

00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:55.153
OFFENDER REGISTRY IN SITUATIONS

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.689
WHERE THERE ARE NINE LGBT --

00:30:57.755 --> 00:31:00.258
COUNTERPARTS WOULD NOT BE FORCED

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:02.193
ONTO THE REGISTRY -- AND SO WHAT

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.763
SB ONE FORTY FIVE DOES -- IS IT

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.733

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.981
HEIDI FELDSTEIN.

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:52.449
AND I'M HERE FROM LOS ANGELES

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:54.084
AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:57.421
FEEL -- AS THOUGH I HAD TO SPEAK

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:58.823
UP ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY

00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:01.592
BECAUSE I STRONGLY SUPPORT.

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:03.294
EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.795
I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE A

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:05.996
DISTINCTION.

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:08.365
AND HOW THE LAW TREATS DIFFERENT

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:10.534
KINDS OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:11.635
WHETHER IT BE MINOR OR MAJOR

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:13.304
HERE IS MY PROBLEM.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.939
EVEN IF THIS BILL PASSES THERE

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:17.241
ARE TWO AREAS WHERE WE DO NOT

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:17.875
HAVE EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:18.709
LAW.

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:20.978
STATUTORY RAPE UNDER TO SIXTY

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.446
ONE POINT FIVE STILL HAS A ROMEO

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:23.881
AND JULIET CLAUSE.

00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:27.284
WHERE? TWO SIXTY ONE POINT FIVE

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:28.519
WHICH IS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:30.955
VAGINAL PENILE INTERCOURSE.

00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:32.623
STILL HAS WHAT'S CALLED A ROMEO

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:33.858
AND JULIET CLOCKS.

00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:35.559
MINERS WITHIN THREE YEARS OF ONE

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:36.460
ANOTHER.

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:38.996
ARE NOT GUILTY OF STATUTORY RAPE

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:40.898
UNDER TO SIXTY ONE POINT FIVE

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:42.533
IT'S STE THERE'S A DISTINCTION

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.368
BETWEEN A MISDEMEANOR AND FELONY.

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:45.736
THAT DOES NOT CARRY OVER FOR

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:48.372
ANAL INTERCOURSE ORAL COPULATION

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:49.907
OR PENETRATION WITH AN OBJECT

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:51.442
OTHER THAN A **** AND AGAIN I'M

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:53.544
SORRY TO BE SO BLUNT BUT THE

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:56.080
PENAL CODE IS THAT BLUNT.

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:58.649
OKAY.

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:01.051
SOMETIMES I AM BUT NOT HERE --

00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:02.319
SO THERE IS STILL NOT EQUAL

00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:03.854
PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW SO THIS

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.256
IS NOT REALLY ABOUT EQUAL

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:06.824
PROTECTION.

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.058
THE SECOND THING IS THAT

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.261
STATUTORY RAPE.

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:12.730
DISCRETION IS NOT GIVEN TO THE

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.765
JUDGE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE AGE

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:15.866
DIFFERENCE.

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:17.401
SHE COULD HAVE A FIFTY YEAR OLD

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:19.169
MAN.

00:42:19.236 --> 00:42:20.671
WITH A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL.

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:23.340
AND REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:25.776
SO AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THIS

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.912
BILL IS FLAWED.

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:30.648
IT ISN'T ABOUT EQUAL PROTECTION.

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:31.715
BECAUSE I'M HERE BECAUSE OF

00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:34.318
EQUAL PROTECTION FOR THE MINERS.

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.086
I DON'T CARE ABOUT EQUAL

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:38.255
PROTECTION FOR THE ADULTS.

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:40.491
WHO ENGAGE IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:42.826
WITH OUR FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:43.661
YEAR OLDS?

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:45.329
I THINK THE DA'S ATTORNEYS

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:47.031
OFFICESCORRECT.

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:48.666
OKAY IF SOMEONE IS FOURTEEN OR

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:51.035
UNDER WE HAVE OTHER AREAS OF THE

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:53.370
LAW WITH WHICH TO PROTECT THEM.

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.539
AND TO REGISTER THEM I THINK THE

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:57.041
DA'S ATTORNEY IS WRONG.

00:42:57.107 --> 00:42:58.943
IN SAYING THAT THIS REGISTER IS

00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:01.178
ONLY FOR USE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:02.947
OUR PARENTS.

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:04.782
USED THIS REGISTERED TO PROTECT

00:43:04.848 --> 00:43:07.318
OUR COMMUNITIES FOURTEEN TO

00:43:07.384 --> 00:43:08.252
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE THE MOST

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:09.820
HEAVILY TRAFFICKED HUMANBEINGS

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:11.755

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:16.060

THAT THEY BASICALLY RAPED A

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:21.332
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL AND A

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:22.766
JUDGE SAYING THE BECAUSE THEY

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:24.134
CAME FROM A GOOD FAMILY AND GOT

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:26.603
GOOD GRADES.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:27.204
THEY'RE GOING TO GET LEFT OFF

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:27.604
THE HOOK.

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:31.041
THIS IS THE WRONG TIME. TO BE

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:32.876
PASSING THIS KIND OF A BILL THAT

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:35.179
IS CANDIDLY BEING PERCEIVED BY

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.613
PRIVATE CITIZENS LIKE ME.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.316
AS EXPOSING OUR DAUGHTERS TO

IMPOSSIBLE FOR SEX OFFENDERS IN

SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY

THE OPPOSITION I THINK THE BILL

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:37.728
DOESN'T SPECIFY.

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:42.299

THERE.

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:45.235
COULD BE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:47.037
THE LANGUAGE TO SUGGEST YOU KNOW

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:49.840
ABOUT MINERS.

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:52.476
THAT -- IT WILL KIND OF OPEN A

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:55.779

00:47:01.418 --> 00:47:03.320
ACTUALLY SPEAKING AND AND AWAY

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:04.721
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL --

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:05.489
BECAUSE SHE POINTED THERE ARE

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.391
MANY OTHER THERE ARE OTHER AREAS

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:09.927

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:26.176
EVERYTHING ON ONE BILL -- THE

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.478
THE OPPONENT THE IDEA THAT THIS

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:04.860
HAPPENS AT LEAST TWICE A DAY FOR

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:07.630
ME -- SO CAN YOU CENTER PROVIDE

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:09.598
SOME CLARITY AS TO HOW THIS DOES

01:06:09.665 --> 01:06:12.968
NOT OPEN THE DOOR TO ALLOW FOR

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:16.439
AN IN RUN -- IF FIRST OF ALL IF

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:19.942
I A MADE AN IMPRESSION IT WAS

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:23.679
COMPLETELY -- UNINTENTIONAL. TO

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:25.381
OBTAIN A WIRETAP I LIKE TO REFER

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.950
TO AS A WIRE TAP AFFIDAVIT AS A

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:29.785
SEARCH WARRANT ON STEROIDS.

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:32.188
BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO PROBABLE

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.357
CAUSE THAT THERE WAS A

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.459
COMMISSION OF ONLY CERTAIN

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:38.394
ENUMERATED DEFENSES THAT ARE

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:39.562
LISTED IN THE STATUTE.

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:40.996
SO WHEN WHEN THE WIRETAP

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:43.165
AFFIDAVIT IS SUBMITTED TO THE

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.533
JUDICIAL OFFICER FOR APPROVAL.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.102
WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:48.838
CAUSE THAT SPECIFIC OFFENSES

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:51.640
SUCH AS NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:52.742
OVER THREE POUNDS WAS COMMITTED.

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:53.843
AND WE ALSO HAVE TO ESTABLISH

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:55.511
NECESSITY.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:57.780
WHICH IS THAT OTHER TRADITIONAL

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.482
INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES HAVE

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:00.850
BEEN TRIED.

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:02.818
OR HAVE FAILED OR ARE NOT

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:03.886
FEASIBLE.

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:06.555
SO THE INITIAL APPLICATION FOR

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:09.558
THE WIRE TAP IS ONLY FOCUSED ON

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:12.194
CERTAIN SPECIFIC CRIMES

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:12.495
[inaudible]

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:14.430
HOWEVER.

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:16.399
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT IN

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.200
CONTROL OF WHAT.

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:21.103
THE TARGETS TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:22.171
ONE MURDER SUSPECT COULD

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:23.873
SUDDENLY START TALKING ABOUT

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:26.876
NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING.

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:30.212
THE CODE IS SET UP SO.

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.781
IF THEY IF THE TARGET START

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:33.482
TALKING ABOUT NON CRIMINAL

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.351
ACTIVITY.

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:37.720
WE HAVE TO MINIMIZE THAT WE HAVE

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:40.523
TO BASICALLY NOT LISTEN TO THOSE

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:41.957
CONVERSATIONS.

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:44.360
AND IN FACT.

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:46.896
THE MONITORING EQUIPMENT THAT IS

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:47.997
USED.

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:50.566
ONCE A CALL IS BEGINS WE

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:52.301
INTERCEPTED HAS NOTHING TO DO

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:54.804
WITH -- WITH THE OFFENSE AND

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.705
THAT MONARCHY EQUIPMENT IS

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.007
TURNED OFF.

01:07:58.073 --> 01:08:00.609
FIRST OF ALL THAT CALL IS NOT

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:03.179
RECORDED ANYMORE SO IT

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:06.015
ESSENTIALLY IS A RACIST IT.

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:08.818
CANNOT BE OBTAINED IT'S NOT

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.252
RECORDED ON THE ON THE LISTENING

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:11.487
DEVICE.

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:12.955
THE FACT THAT THE CALL IS MADE

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:15.357
IS RECORDED SO WE DO KNOW THAT I

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.592
CALLED DâN.

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:19.094
HOWEVER WHAT DAN AND I TALKED

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:21.831
ABOUT IS NOT ACTUALLY RECORDED.

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:25.067
AND THE EQUIPMENT IS METERED SO

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.236
SUBSEQUENT LITIGATION WE CAN

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:29.305
SPOT CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:31.106
THE OFFICERS WHO WERE DOING THE

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:33.242
MONITORING ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.343
LAW.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:37.813
AND FAILURE TO MINIMIZE.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.181
IS THE GROUND FOR SUPPRESSION SO

01:08:39.248 --> 01:08:40.182
THERE'S A LOT OF BUILT IN

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:45.120
PROTECTIONS. FOR A DEFENDANT WHO.

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.889
MAKES THE MOTION THAT HIS OR HER

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.491
CONVERSATIONS WERE ILLEGALLY

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:50.159
RECORDED.

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:51.727
LIMIT LET ME FOLLOW UP I'M NOT

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.095
SURE THAT FIGHTING ANSWERED YOUR

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.530
QUESTION SO LET ME.

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:55.664
LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE.

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.666
SO IT IN THE ORIGINAL BILL THERE

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:59.802
WERE SIXTEEN SERIOUS OFFENSES

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:01.537
THAT WERE LISTED WEEK WE'VE STE

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:02.705
OF STRUCK.

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:04.039
MOST OF THEM.

01:09:04.106 --> 01:09:05.841
BUT ONE OF THEM ITEM NUMBER FIVE

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.776
HOLDING A HOSTAGE BY PERSON

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.111
CONFIDE IN STATE PRISON.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:11.247
SO IF YOU HAVE A WIRE TAP THAT

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:12.381
EXISTS.

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:15.484
AND FOR A LEGITIMATE REASON AS

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.520
WAS AUTHORIZED IN THE ORIGINAL

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:19.622
STATUTE AND SOMEONE SAYS IN THE

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.724
COURSE OF THAT OH BY THE WAY

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.226
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD A HOSTAGE.

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:25.861
IN A STATE PRISON.

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:26.795
ALL RIGHT THAT THAT CAN'T BE

01:09:26.862 --> 01:09:28.664
USED IN EVIDENCE IN AND TO THE

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:33.269
EXTENT THAT THEN THAT BECOMES --

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.871
OTHER OTHER EVIDENCES DERIVATIVE

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:36.972
THAT IS THROUGH THE POISONOUS

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:37.172
TREE.

01:09:37.239 --> 01:09:40.676
SO. TO TO YOUR POINT IT DOESN'T

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:42.177
PROVIDE AND AND RUN.

01:09:42.244 --> 01:09:43.812
NOW FOR ME NOT THAT I DO HAVE

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:46.048
CONCERNS ABOUT ELIMINATION OF

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:46.715
THAT BUT I UNDERSTAND THE

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:47.616
COMMITTEES COULD.

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.518

VIOLENCE CIRCUMSTANCES IN A

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:28.070
CULTURALLY SENSITIVE MANNER.

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:29.538
DATA SHOWS A MULTIPLE REASONS

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:31.573
WHY SURVIVORS OF ABUSE MAY NOT

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.941
COME FORWARD WITHIN THE STATURE

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:34.476
LIMITATION INCLUDING.

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:36.912
THEIR AGE AT THE TIME OF ABUSE

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.981
ONGOING TRAUMA THREATS FROM

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:40.582
THEIR PERPETRATOR FOR LACK OF

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:41.683
EVIDENCE.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.252
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A HORRIBLE

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.787
CRIME THAT AFFLICTS A HEAVY TOLL

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:46.488
ON ITS VICTIMS AND WHEN IT COMES

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.991
TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.359
STATISTICS ARE GRAHAM.

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:52.828
MANY VICTIMS REPORT ONLY AFTER

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:55.063
THEY LEARN THAT THEIR ABUSER IS

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:58.467
ALREADY ABUSING SOMEONE ELSE.

01:13:58.534 --> 01:13:59.968
SOME COME FORWARD WITH VIDEO.

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:01.470
AUDIO RECORDINGS AND FORDER

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:02.538
GRAPHS.

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.540
HOWEVER NOTHING COULD BE DONE

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:06.942
BECAUSE THERE THREE YEARS ARE UP.

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.044
IN AMERICA AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:10.512
WOMEN ARE SHOT TO DEATH BY THEIR

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:12.714
ABUSERS.

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:14.583
EVERY MONTH AND MANY MORE ARE

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.018
INJURED.

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.886
THIS ISSUE IS VERY PERSONAL TO

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:18.620
ME.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:20.389
AS I TOO AM A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:21.523
VIOLENCE.

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.091
WHEN I STORY BECAME PUBLIC IN

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:24.960
THE MEDIA HUNDREDS OF WOMEN FELT

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.429
COMPELLED TO TELL THEIR STORIES?

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:30.065
AND SHARE THEIR PERSONAL TRAUMAS.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.667
THE ONE THING THEY ALL HAD IN

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.569
COMMON WAS THAT.

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.204
DEEP ROOTED TRAUMA AND

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.638
PARALYZING FEAR.

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:38.273
THAT TAKE THE MANY YEARS TO

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.308
OVERCOME.

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:40.809
AND MANY WERE NEVER ABLE TO TELL

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.778
ANYONE EVEN AFTER THE

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.112
RELATIONSHIP ENDED.

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:45.881
ON AVERAGE NEARLY TWENTY PEOPLE

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.216
PER MINUTE ARE VICTIMS OF

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:49.051
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE BY AN INTIMATE

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:50.752
PARTNER IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.521
UNFORTUNATELY IN RECENT YEARS WE

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:54.623
HAVE WITNESSED THE ESCALATION OF

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.291
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:59.361
CASES RESULT IN DEATH.

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:01.029
TRAGICALLY WE JUST EXPERIENCE

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.731
THE RECENT DEATH OF A YOUNG

01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:04.867
POLICE OFFICER.

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.134
SOLOMON.

IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHO IS

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:08.904
ANSWERING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:13.208
CALL.

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:15.444
THIS IS THE HEART OF THE BILL.

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.845
VICTIMS NEVER KNOW IF THE ABUSE

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.114
WILL ESCALATE TO MURDER EVEN

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:20.482
AFTER THE RELATIONSHIP HAS ENDED.

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.784
SO FEAR RUNS DEEP AND PUSHES

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.820
VICTIMS AND TO SILENCE SOMETIMES

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:25.954

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.556
AT TIMES ABUSES WILL END UP

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:29.691
TAKING IT OUT ON THEIR CHILDREN

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:30.993

AMBUSHED HER.

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:09.498
AND TERRORIZED HER AND HER

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.388
AND THE SHAME CONTINUES FOR A

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:34.656
LIFETIME.

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:35.657

THE SAME IS OVERWHELMING THE FOR

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:08.904
THE TIME MIGHT SOMEHOW REPEAT

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.572
PAST PATTERNS AND FIND MYSELF

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.040
BACK IN THE CYCLE.

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.942
WHEN I FINALLY FOUND THE COURAGE

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.143
SEVEN YEARS LATE TO SEEK LEGAL

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:22.317
NOTHING COULD BE DONE.

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:25.220
SO I LIVE.

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:25.754
SO I LIVE WITH THE DAILY

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.290

WHAT MIGHT A VICTIM DO?

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:24.913
THE ANSWER SEEMS OBVIOUS TO MANY

50% OF THE TIME FOR MOST VICTIMS

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:41.162
AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE FOR

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:43.265
MARGINALIZED VICTIMS OF COLOR

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:43.565
[inaudible]

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.033
WHY?

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.635
THE FIRST BARRIER IS THE VERY

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:48.737
TRAUMA ITSELF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

TRANSGENDER COMMUNITIES.

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:04.419
IT IS A SOCIETAL ISSUE ROOTED IN

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:05.920
GENDER BASED VIOLENCE FOR

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:07.622

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:12.327
CONTROL.

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.262

WOUNDS ARE SHOCKED THAT A LONG

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:00.342
LASTING EFFECTS.

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.477
EMOTIONAL TRAUMA MAY TAKE MANY

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.212
DIFFERENT FORMS SHOCK OR

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:07.148
NUMBNESS FEELING FROZEN AND CUT

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:08.450
OFF FROM YOUR OWN EMOTIONS.

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:09.918
VICTIMS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:11.553
DECISIONS OR CONDUCT THEIR LIVES

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:12.787
AS THEY DID ONCE BEFORE THE

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:13.822
CRIME.

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:16.591
TRAUMATIC MEMORIES ARE HARSH AND

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:18.860
FROZEN IMPRINTS THESE FROZEN

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:21.930
IMPRINTS MUST BE THAWED AND

01:23:21.996 --> 01:23:23.465
ENVIRONMENT OF SAFETY.

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.733
BEFORE THEY CAN BE TOLD.

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:25.934
VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DO

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.470
NOT EASILY FEEL SAFE ANYWHERE.

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.305
IT THAT IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:32.907
ESCAPE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE

01:23:32.974 --> 01:23:35.076
AND MANY MORE TO FINALLY FEEL.

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:37.045
SKEWS ME FEEL SAFE ENOUGH TO

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:38.346
TALK ABOUT IT.

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:40.014
EVEN WHEN VICTIMS DO BEGIN TO

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:41.716
TELL THEIR STORY THE THOUGHTS OF

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:44.052
PAST ABUSE MAY SHUT DOWN THE

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:45.587
FRONTAL LOBE OF THE BRAIN.

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:47.555
THIS VERY PART OF THE BRAIN IS

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:49.657
WHAT WE NEED TO PUT OUR FEELINGS

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:51.092
INTO WORDS.

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:53.228
WHEN THE FRONTAL LOBES SETS DOWN

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.329
THE IMPRINTS OF TRAUMATIC

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:56.664
EXPERIENCES ARE NOT ORGANIZED AS

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.366
COHERENT LEGAL NARRATIVES

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:00.235
LOGICAL NARRATIVES?

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:01.536
BUT IN FRAGMENTED SENSORY

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:05.373
EMOTIONAL TRACES IMAGES SOUNDS

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.741
AND PHYSICAL SENSATIONS.

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:08.810
ADDITIONALLY WHEN VICTIMS DO NOT

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.678
RECEIVE THE SUPPORT AND HELP

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:12.213
THEY NEED AFTER THE CRIME THEY

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.083
MAY SUFFER SECONDARY INJURIES.

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:16.217
THEY MAY BE HURT BY A LACK OF

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:17.652
UNDERSTANDING FROM FRIENDS

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.487
FAMILY AND THE PROFESSIONALS

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:20.922
THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH.

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:22.791
PARTICULARLY IF OTHERS SEEM TO

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:25.126
BLAME THE VICTIM FOR THE CRIME

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:26.628
SUGGESTING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.296
BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT IT OR AVOID

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:29.397
IT.

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:30.899
BASED ON NATIONWIDE SURVEY OF

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:33.268
ADVOCATES ATTORNEY SERVICE

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:34.002
PROVIDERS A NONPROFIT WORKERS

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:35.637

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:36.838
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:40.241
ASSAULT VICTIMS. 88% OF THE

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.477
RESPONDENTS REPORTED THAT POLICE

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:44.546
SOMETIMES OR OFTEN DO NOT

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:46.514
BELIEVE VICTIMS OR BLAME VICTIMS

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.383
FOR THE VIOLENCE.

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:49.984
WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE THE

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.286
ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR LAW

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.821
ENFORCEMENT AND THIS BILL IS

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.889
VERY HELPFUL AND WILL ADDRESS

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:56.191
THOSE ISSUES.

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:57.459
WOMEN OF ALL RACES AND

01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:59.060
ETHNICITIES WEAPON DOOR DOMESTIC

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:00.728
VIOLENCE HAVE TO MAKE THAT

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:02.430
CHOICE AT SOME POINT IN TIME TO

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:04.599
STAY OR LEAVE THE ABUSERS. FOR

01:25:04.666 --> 01:25:06.501
MANY WOMEN OF COLOR ESPECIALLY

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:09.237
BACKGROUND AND LGBT Q. THE FIRST

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:12.607
RESPONSE IS OFTEN TO NOT REPORT.

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:14.909
NOT TELL ANYONE WE WANT TO

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:16.878
PROTECT OUR PARTNERS IT IS NOT

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.480
EASY TO TURN THEM OVER TO THE

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:20.281
POLICE THE COURTS AND OTHER

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:22.851
INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:24.118
HISTORICALLY BY US.

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:25.854
PEOPLE WITH IMMIGRANT STATUS MAY

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.655
FEAR BEING DEPORTED IF THEY LACK

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:28.990
DOCUMENTATION.

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.925
EXTENDING THE LIMITATIONS TO THE

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.760
MAXIMUM YOU WILL ALLOW IS A

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.429
TRAUMA INFORMED PIECE OF

01:25:34.496 --> 01:25:35.763
LEGISLATION.

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.232
THAT SUPPORTS BOTH THE VICTIM

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:39.968
SURVIVOR AND THE FIRST RESPONDER.

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.603
THE SURVIVOR WILL GET TIME TO

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:43.905
HEAL ACCESS HELP AND RESOURCES

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.974
IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE FEAR AND

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:49.010
STRESS OF ESCAPING THE TEAR.

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:50.311
BEFORE.

01:25:50.378 --> 01:25:51.880
RE EXPERIENCING THE TRAUMA OF

01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:53.414
REPORTING AND THE PROCESS OF

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:56.684
SEEKING JUSTICE BEFORE HE SHE OR

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:58.253
THEY ARE READY.

01:25:58.319 --> 01:25:59.954
FAILURE IS A MEMORY THAT LEAD TO

01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:01.956
NOT BE BELIEVED OR WORSE VICTIM

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.691
BLAMING SELF BLAME TREAT

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:05.960
TRIGGERS THE FEAR OF RETRIBUTION

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:07.295
BY THE ABUSER.

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:09.130
BECAUSE NO CONSEQUENCES WERE

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:11.332
GIVEN FOR THE DVD CRIME OF TV

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:14.202
AND I PAVE A THIS IS WHAT IMPACT

01:26:14.269 --> 01:26:15.670
SURVIVORS OF TV THE MOST.

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:17.605
NOT BEING BELIEVED NOT BEING

01:26:17.672 --> 01:26:18.973
UNDERSTOOD.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.008
AND MANY MARGINALIZED

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:22.210
COMMUNITIES DO NOT EVEN KNOW

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:23.745
IT'S A CRIME.

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:25.113
THE TRAINING PIECE OF THIS BILL

THANK YOU.

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:07.234

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:11.505
BILL FORWARD AND FOR THAT

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:15.142
PERSISTENT ADVOCACY -- YOU KNOW.

01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:16.811
WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT A LOT

01:35:16.877 --> 01:35:19.480
OF THINGS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:21.615
SORT OF SEXUAL OFFENSE IT JUST

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:22.750
CAME UP AND KIND OF DE

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:24.085
STIGMATIZING.

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:25.286
WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT

01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:26.887
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:28.556
AND WE DON'T REALLY FRAME IT IN

01:35:28.622 --> 01:35:30.291
A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOR FOLKS TO

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:31.759
HAVE EQUITABLE CONVERSATIONS

01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:33.127
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT VIOLENCE

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:35.930
AGAINST WOMEN -- AND IT'S NOT

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:37.598
JUST ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.066
CERTAIN KINDS OF WOMEN.

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:43.204
I WOULD HOPE THAT -- THE AUTHOR

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:45.005
IN THE ADVOCATES CAN RESPOND TO

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:47.174
MY QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT

01:35:47.241 --> 01:35:49.243
SOME OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:52.913
ANALYSIS -- IS LEGITIMATE -- AND

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.248
I'M GONNA SHARE THE QUESTION

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:55.716
FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE BECAUSE

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:57.585
OFTENTIMES WHAT WE LIKE TO DO IS

01:35:57.651 --> 01:35:59.286
WE DISCOUNT SOMEONEELSE'S

01:35:59.353 --> 01:36:00.921
EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT'S NOT OUR

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.857
OWN.

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:04.792
AND SOUND PUBLIC POLICY.

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.293
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.761
EXPERIENCES BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:09.663
HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:12.733
IS BEST FOR THE ENTIRE STATE.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.569
SO -- MAYHEM ASSAULT BATTERY

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.438
MURDER MANY OF THE THINGS THAT

01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:19.373
WERE SHARED IN THE TESTIMONY ARE

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.475
ALREADY CHARGEABLE OFFENSES AND

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:22.610
IF THEY ARE NOT.

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:24.044
THE NOT THE CONVERSATION THAT WE

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:24.778
SHOULD BE HAVING WITH LAW

01:36:24.845 --> 01:36:26.780
ENFORCEMENT ABOUT WHY WE DO NOT

01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:29.483
SEE VALUE IN THAT VICTIM COMING

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:31.252
FORWARD.

01:36:31.318 --> 01:36:32.520
BECAUSE EITHER THEY'RE DEAD OR

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:34.722
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN HURT -- AND

01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:36.857
THAT THE ALLEGED PERPETRATOR IS

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:38.192
NOT CHARGED.

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:39.860
BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:43.164
TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:44.732
PEOPLE DO LIKE.

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:45.966
REVENGE.

01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:48.936
AND PEOPLE DO LIKE TO RETALIATE

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:53.374
AND THERE ARE INSTANCES DIVORCE.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.642
ADD SEPARATION THAT ARE NOT

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:56.277
AMICABLE.

01:36:56.343 --> 01:36:57.878
WHERE FOLKS ARE LOOKING FOR

01:36:57.945 --> 01:37:00.881
THEIR POUND OF FLESH?

01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:03.617
AND MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE

01:37:03.684 --> 01:37:05.753
PROTECT.

01:37:05.819 --> 01:37:07.922
AGAINST THOSE SITUATIONS FROM

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:09.256
HAPPENING FROM SOMEONE SAYING

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:11.258
HEY BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE EXTENDED

01:37:11.325 --> 01:37:11.725
THE STATUTE OF LIBERTY

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:12.860
LIMITATIONS.

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:17.198
AND I HAD A LESS THAN DESIRABLE.

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:19.767
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PERSON I'M

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:21.569
GOING TO USE THIS LAW. TO SEEK

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:23.370
THAT KIND OF A RANGE I ASKED

01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:24.538
THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:27.107
HAPPENED TO ME.

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:31.712
IT HAPPENED TO ME -- AND I AM

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:33.914
CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO AFFORD

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:35.716
SOMEONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:37.618
CONTINUE.

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:39.887
TO SEEK WAYS TO TRAUMATIZE ME

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:42.890
AND THOSE WAYS YES AND SO I'M

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:45.392
JUST CURIOUS TO SEE HOW WE CAN

01:37:45.459 --> 01:37:47.094
BOTH PROTECT.

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:51.632
TRUE LEGITIMATE VICTIMS -- OF

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.234
THESE KINDS OF ASSAULT.

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.402
WHILE STILL SORT OF PROTECTING

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:56.503
AGAINST SOME OF THE UNINTENDED

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.539
CONSEQUENCES AND I RECOGNIZE

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.608
SOME OF THAT WAS -- ATTEMPTED TO

01:38:00.674 --> 01:38:03.410
BE ADDRESSED IN THE AMENDMENTS --

01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:05.379
BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:07.381
GIVE YOU ALL TIME TO TALK ABOUT

01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:10.351
THIS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:10.884
IMPORTANT IN BE IT'S VERY

01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:12.186
PERSONAL.

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:13.687
I'LL START OUT WELL THANK YOU

01:38:13.754 --> 01:38:14.888
FOR FOR THAT QUESTION AND I DO

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:16.390
SHOW YOUR CONCERN -- AND I'M

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:18.759
SENSITIVE TO TO THAT ISSUE AND

01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:21.395
THAT IS WHY THIS BILL REQUIRES --

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:23.864
THAT IT'S EVIDENCE BASED.

01:38:23.931 --> 01:38:26.967
THAT WHEN THEY DO COME FORWARD --

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:29.036
THERE HAS TO BE EVENTS SUCH AS

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:33.140
VIDEO AUDIO -- AS WE HEARD FROM --

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:35.109
THE TESTIMONY EVEN WITH THE

01:38:35.175 --> 01:38:37.878
AUDIO VIDEO OF THREATS OP SHE

01:38:37.945 --> 01:38:39.446
WASN'T ABLE TO BRING HER ABUSER

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:40.948
TO JUSTICE SO THERE IS A

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:42.349
COMPONENT THAT WAS THAT IT.

01:38:42.416 --> 01:38:44.551
THAT MAKES IT EVIDENCE BASED

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:46.320
VERSUS JUST SOMEONE ACCUSING

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:49.390
SOMEONE AND JESSE SO WE WANTED

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:49.990
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS IN

01:38:50.057 --> 01:38:51.258
THERE.

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:52.660
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT.

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:54.428
TO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:55.863
THERE'S A COUPLE WAYS THAT I

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:56.964
WANT TO ADDRESS THAT FIRST OF

01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:59.033
ALL JUST IN MY EXPERIENCE OF

01:38:59.099 --> 01:38:59.833
THIRTY EIGHT YEARS AND WORKING

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.568
WITH WOMEN WHO ACTUALLY.

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:03.003
I HAVE BEEN IN PRISON FOR

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.638
KILLING THEIR ABUSER.

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.073
WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO THAT IS

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.374
THAT THAT IS OFTEN THE VERY LAST

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:10.077
OPTION FOR ANY SURVIVOR AND

01:39:10.144 --> 01:39:11.278
USUALLY BECAUSE SYSTEMS HAVE

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:13.380
FAILED HER REPEATEDLY AGAIN AND

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:14.281
AGAIN?

01:39:14.348 --> 01:39:15.649
SO THAT'S ONE SIDE OF IT AND A

01:39:15.716 --> 01:39:17.051
SMALL PIECE BUT WE CAN LOOK INTO

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:18.686
ALL THE DATA THAT SUPPORTS THAT

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:21.622
PARTICULAR -- STATEMENT BUT MORE

01:39:21.689 --> 01:39:22.690
IMPORTANTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:39:22.756 --> 01:39:24.625
ABOUT TODAY AND BECAUSE THIS IS

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.060
NOW THE FOURTH FIFTH SIXTH

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.461
GENERATION OF VIOLENCE IN OUR

01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:28.329
FAMILIES.

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:30.731
WHICH IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR AND

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:31.999
SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:33.400
THIS IS LEARNED AND WE LIVE IN A

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:34.968
VIOLENT VIOLENT COMMUNITY

01:39:35.035 --> 01:39:35.869
LIFELINE.

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:37.404
WORLD WHERE POWER AND CONTROL IN

01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:39.373
THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO CONTROL

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.108
SOMEONE OR TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IS

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:42.443
ALSO SYSTEMIC.

01:39:42.509 --> 01:39:43.944
SO WHAT WE'RE ALSO UNDERSTANDING

01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:44.812
IS THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

01:39:44.878 --> 01:39:47.614
BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AGGRESSOR.

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:49.817
AND A DOMINANT AGGRESSOR TRAIN

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.618
IS WHAT REQUIRES THAT ALL OF US

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:53.721
IN OUR FIELD AND THE DOMESTIC

01:39:53.787 --> 01:39:54.722
VIOLENCE FIELD.

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:57.124
AS IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE

01:39:57.191 --> 01:39:59.126
UNDERSTAND MORE MORE ABOUT THE

01:39:59.193 --> 01:40:00.694
IMPACT OF TRAUMA TO THE BRAIN.

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:02.663
UNDERSTAND WHAT AN INJURY IN

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:04.598
DOMESTIC BONDS ACTUALLY DOES DUE

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:05.499
TO A VICTIM.

01:40:05.566 --> 01:40:06.300
WE UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:08.535
BETWEEN COERCIVE CONTROL AND

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:14.174
PRIMARY DOMINANT AGGRESSOR AND

01:40:14.241 --> 01:40:14.775
SO WHEN YOU START TO TRAIN THE

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.276
SALON FOR MEANT.

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:17.144
THAT WE AS ADVOCATES WE CAN BE

01:40:17.211 --> 01:40:17.745
CONSULTANTS COLLABORATE WITH

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:19.747
THESE THINGS FIRST OF ALL YOU

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:21.415
ELIMINATE THAT REVENGE PIECE

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:22.182
WHICH I AGREE.

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:22.783
I AGREE AND SUPPORT YOU WITH

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:23.684
THAT THAT THAT IS PRESENT BUT

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:25.285
THERE IS A WAY TO FILTER THAT

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:27.121
OUT TO BE ABLE TO SAY FROM OUR

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:28.789
EXPERT POINT OF VIEW WHAT IS A

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:29.456
TRUE.

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:32.126
VICTIM RESPONSE AND REACTION.

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:34.061
VERSUS WHAT IS A PRIMARY

01:40:34.128 --> 01:40:35.796
DOMINANT POWER AND CONTROL USE

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:37.331
OF ABUSE.

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:39.166
DEBT TO TO GET THE EXACT EVENTS

01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:40.367
OR HAVE POWER AND CONTROL OVER

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:42.302
SOMEONE INDEFINITELY THERE IS

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:44.138
THAT IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL PIECE

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:44.571
THAT.

01:40:44.638 --> 01:40:46.273
TRAUMA SURVIVORS LIKE AS AND D.

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:48.041
V. D. V. EXPERTS HAVE TO DEAL

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:49.777
WITH EVERY DAY WHEN WE DO LEGAL

01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:50.944
WORK WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FILL

01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:52.079
OUT AN RO.

01:40:52.146 --> 01:40:53.447
OR ANYTHING ELSE FOR SURVIVORS

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:55.916
WE HAVE TO SIFT THROUGH THAT TOO

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:57.084
AS ADVOCATES IT'S BEEN

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:58.819
CHALLENGING FOR OUR MOVEMENT BUT

01:40:58.886 --> 01:41:00.320
IT IS WHERE WE ARE NOW.

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:02.523
SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN THIS

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:03.957
THIS FIELD OF EDUCATING

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:06.727
OURSELVES AND UNDERSTANDING THAT.

01:41:06.794 --> 01:41:08.195
IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE JUSTICE

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:10.097
YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE THIS PIECE

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:12.332
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT JUST A CRIME

01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:14.435
IT'S BEHAVIORAL IT'S LEARNED AND

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:15.636
GENERATIONAL.

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:17.638
AND ITS HISTORICAL AND IF WE

01:41:17.704 --> 01:41:22.309
DON'T TAKE ALL OF THAT INTO

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:24.244
CONSIDERATION.

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:26.213
WHAT THIS WHAT EVEN ARE MY THE

POSITION I CAN CONCUR WITH MANY

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:29.583
ELEMENTS OF WHAT THEY SAID?

01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:31.685
BUT HERE'S THE THING 450% OF

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:33.320
SURVIVORS WHO DON'T EVEN REPORT

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:35.622
IT TO BEGIN WITH IT'S BECAUSE WE

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:38.358
HAVE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS THAT

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:39.860
DON'T EVEN LET US GO THERE IN

01:41:39.927 --> 01:41:41.361
THE FIRST PLACE.

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:42.930
SO HOW MANY OF US ARE TOLD DON'T

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:44.465
EVEN CALL THE COPS.

01:41:44.531 --> 01:41:45.833
THAT IS WHAT WILL GET YOU THE

01:41:45.899 --> 01:41:47.201
WORST BEATING OF YOUR LIFE.

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:48.836

01:41:51.672 --> 01:41:52.439
TRAINED YEAR.

01:41:52.506 --> 01:41:54.708
YOUR YOUR RELIGION YOU'RE

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:56.643
BETRAYING ALL OF THESE PIECES SO

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:57.945
THAT'S KEEPING US TRAPPED WE

01:41:58.011 --> 01:41:59.480
NEED TIME TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:00.714
THOSE PIECES.

01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:02.149
AND AN ADVOCATE AND THE VICTIM

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:06.019
CAN NEVER EVER STAND FOR HERSELF

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:08.355
ABOUT THAT HELP.

01:42:08.422 --> 01:42:10.557
THANK YOU RIGHT ANY OTHER

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:11.959
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

01:42:12.025 --> 01:42:12.926
MR LACKEY.

01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:13.961
YEAH CENTER RUBIO THANK YOU FOR

01:42:14.027 --> 01:42:15.662
BRINGING THIS SO. TO THE

01:42:15.729 --> 01:42:17.231
FOREFRONT HERE TODAY -- AND

01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:19.700
WITNESSES THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:20.968
VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONIES.

01:42:21.034 --> 01:42:22.536
YOU KNOW THIS -- DOMESTIC

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:24.838
VIOLENCE ISSUES I THINK ONE OF

01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:27.074
OUR THE BIGGEST.

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:30.210
TOXINS TO OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY.

01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:33.313
AND IT'S QUITE COMPLEX.

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.115
BUT THIS IS JUST ONE VERY

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:38.852
PIVOTAL TOOL VERY POWERFUL TOOL.

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:41.355
IN ALLOWING REMEDY TO TAKE PLACE

01:42:41.421 --> 01:42:42.756
AND I THINK EVEN PREVENTION.

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:43.857
BECAUSE I I THINK THE GOAL WOULD

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:45.425
BE.

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:47.427
I MEAN THE MOST IDEAL SITUATION

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:48.996
IS PREVENTION BUT WE HAVE TO

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:52.099
KNOW IN REALITY THAT THAT IS NOT.

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:53.400
POSSIBLE IN EVERY CASE.

01:42:53.467 --> 01:42:54.968
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

01:42:55.035 --> 01:42:56.203
SO WE NEED TOOLS WHEN IT DOES

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:59.940
HAPPEN. TO SUPPORT VICTIMS.

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.008
VICTIMS ARE THE ONES THAT

01:43:01.074 --> 01:43:03.877
DESERVE THE SUPPORT AND WE NEED.

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:05.145
TO TRY TO HELP THE PEOPLE HAVE

01:43:05.212 --> 01:43:06.880
THE PROBLEMS BUT MORE

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:08.048
IMPORTANTLY.

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:09.249
AND THE PERSON WHO DESERVES THE

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:12.019
MOST SUPPORT IS THE VICTIM.

01:43:12.085 --> 01:43:14.121
AND SO I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:15.789
THIS PARTICULAR TOOL IT'S

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:17.257
ALARMING TO ME THAT YOU EVEN

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:19.493
HAVE TO BRING THIS FORWARD.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.695
IT IT IT SHOCKS THE CONSCIENCE.

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:23.797
THAT WE HAVE.

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:25.666
THIS LIMIT TO REPORT WHAT ARE WE

01:43:25.732 --> 01:43:28.502
DOING AS A SOCIETY WHEN WE HI

01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:33.006
SHOULD PROTECT THOSE WHO HAVE NO.

01:43:33.073 --> 01:43:35.542
DESERVES CIRCUMSTANCE IN THAT

01:43:35.609 --> 01:43:37.444
REGARD IS SHAMEFUL.

01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:38.979
AND IN MY OPINION IT SHAMEFUL

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:40.847
THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION TO THIS --

01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:43.417
BECAUSE IT'S INSENSITIVE TO

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:45.519
THOSE WHO TRULY NEED.

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:46.987
THIS AVENUE TO BE ABLE TO

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:48.555
EXPRESS.

01:43:48.622 --> 01:43:50.991
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM.

01:43:51.058 --> 01:43:52.926

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:54.094
CONTINUING AND OTHER

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:56.263
RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THIS IS

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:57.531
EXTREMELY [inaudible]

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:59.666
VOLATILE.

01:43:59.733 --> 01:44:02.703
AND VERY VERY TOXIC PROBLEM THAT --

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:05.172
ABUSERS CARRY WITH THEM.

01:44:05.238 --> 01:44:06.206

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:30.464
I DO WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:32.265
POINTS THAT ARE OPPOSITION TO

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:35.335
STATED -- IT IT REALLY HITS HARD

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:37.838
WHEN I HEAR -- AND THEIR WORDS

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:41.341
IT THREATENS DEFENDANT'S RIGHTS.

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:43.443
BUT I DID NOT HEAR VICTIMS

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:45.579
RIGHTS AND I BELIEVE MR LACKEY

01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:48.682
SAID IT BEST THIS IS NOT ABOUT.

01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:51.885
US BECAUSE OUR TIME IS UP IT'S

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:53.687
ABOUT PROTECTING THE NEXT

01:44:53.754 --> 01:44:54.988
GENERATION OF VICTIMS WERE

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:57.190
PROBABLY CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING

01:44:57.257 --> 01:44:58.392
A WE DID.

01:44:58.458 --> 01:45:00.761
AND THEY ALSO CITED [inaudible]

01:45:00.827 --> 01:45:02.696
DEFICIENT MEMORY.

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:05.766
IN EIGHT YEARS I CAN ASSURE YOU

01:45:05.832 --> 01:45:08.568
WE REMEMBER EVERY PUNCH EVERY

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:10.370
CáC EVERY ASSAULT.

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:12.139
AND THEY ALSO CITED THE SUPREME

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:13.740
COURT CASE THAT TALKS ABOUT THE

01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:14.941
IMPORTANCE OF STATUTES OF

01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:16.043
LIMITATIONS AND WHY THEY'RE

01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:17.611
THERE BUT WE HAVE EVOLVED AS A

01:45:17.678 --> 01:45:18.812
SOCIETY.

01:45:18.879 --> 01:45:20.313
JUST LAST YEAR I BELIEVE WE

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:21.081
REMOVE THE STATUTE OF

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:22.916
LIMITATIONS ON SEXUAL ASSAULT

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:25.686
BECAUSE RESEARCH KEEPS SHOWING.

01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:28.922
THAT TRAUMA CAUSES WOMEN TO TO

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:30.557
GOING TO THE SHUTTLE'S.

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:32.125
MORE AND MORE -- INFORMATION'S

01:45:32.192 --> 01:45:33.694
COMING OUT THAT STATES THAT

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.429
WOMEN NEED THAT TIME TO FEEL

01:45:35.495 --> 01:45:37.998
SAFE AND IT'S ALL ABOUT SAFETY I

01:45:38.065 --> 01:45:43.804
WHICH

01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:45.605
FATHER WAS SHOT AND THAT'S WHAT

01:45:45.672 --> 01:45:47.140
WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID.

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:49.276
AND SO I I DO RESPECTFULLY

01:45:49.342 --> 01:45:51.078
DISAGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION I

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:52.646
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT I

01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:55.515
THINK IT IS TIME. THREE YEARS IN

01:45:55.582 --> 01:45:57.350
AN ALREADY COMPLICATED OBSTACLE

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:59.019
COURSE.

01:45:59.086 --> 01:46:01.388
IS NOT ENOUGH. THREE YEARS IS

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:04.057
JUST ENOUGH TO GET AWAY AND FEEL

01:46:04.124 --> 01:46:05.859
SAFE AND THEN IT TAKES THREE

01:46:05.926 --> 01:46:07.527
FOUR MORE YEARS TO FIGURE OUT

01:46:07.594 --> 01:46:09.863
THAT IT'S OKAY TO SPEAK UP.

01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:12.232
AND SO I WANT TO THINK AS ME AND

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:13.600
DOM AND MISS WHITE FEATHER FOR

01:46:13.667 --> 01:46:14.868
BEING HERE BECAUSE THESE ARE

01:46:14.935 --> 01:46:16.636
PERSONAL STORIES THAT NO ONE

01:46:16.703 --> 01:46:18.572
TELLS AND IT TAKES A LOT OF

01:46:18.638 --> 01:46:19.973
COURAGE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.575
WHO IS IN THE PUBLIC EYE TO

01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:23.376
SHARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME I KNOW

01:46:23.443 --> 01:46:24.745
HOW HARD IT WAS FOR ME?

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:26.046
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW MUCH

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:28.081
HARDER IT WAS FOR HER AND SO

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:30.250
WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

01:46:30.317 --> 01:46:31.985

GENERALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

02:16:51.303 --> 02:16:55.473
COST OF NOT BEING OF PRIVILEGE

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:58.510
AND HOW PERVERSELY EVIDENT IT IS

02:16:58.577 --> 02:17:01.279
WITH REGARDS TO THE PENAL CODE.

02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:02.981
AND THE REALITY IS.

02:17:03.048 --> 02:17:04.916

A GOOD DEFENSE.

02:17:14.659 --> 02:17:16.828

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:17.696
AREN'T EVEN TAKEN INTO

02:17:17.762 --> 02:17:19.998
CONSIDERATION AND SO THIS IS

02:17:20.065 --> 02:17:21.499

YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE DON'T

02:17:47.959 --> 02:17:50.428
UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS TO GET

02:17:50.495 --> 02:17:53.064
AND TO KEEP MONEY ON THE BOOKS

02:17:53.131 --> 02:17:55.300
AND HOW QUICKLY THOSE DOLLARS.

02:17:55.367 --> 02:17:58.403
AND CENTS GO AWAY AND HOW OFTEN

02:17:58.470 --> 02:17:59.904
THEY CAN BE LEVERAGED.

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:02.974
AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH MANY

02:18:03.041 --> 02:18:04.409
OF WHAT THE OPPONENTS SAID ABOUT

02:18:04.476 --> 02:18:06.978
THESE REALLY GOOD AND IMPORTANT.

02:18:07.045 --> 02:18:08.680
AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THAT

02:18:08.747 --> 02:18:10.582
ARE BEING OFFERED AND THAT WE

02:18:10.649 --> 02:18:12.250
SHOULD CONTINUE TO OFFER THEM I

02:18:12.317 --> 02:18:13.952
WOULD HOPE THAT PASSING THIS

02:18:14.019 --> 02:18:15.754
BILL DOES NOT MEAN.

02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:17.155
THAT WE WILL GET RID OF THOSE

02:18:17.222 --> 02:18:18.623
PROGRAMS WE SHOULD NOT HAVE

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:21.760
BINARY CONVERSATIONS.

02:18:21.826 --> 02:18:24.596
BUT WE ALSO SHOULDN'T PAY FOR

02:18:24.663 --> 02:18:27.599
THOSE PROGRAMS ON THE BACKS OR

02:18:27.666 --> 02:18:29.401
PAY FOR A SYSTEM RATHER ON THE

02:18:29.467 --> 02:18:32.504
BACKS OF THE POOR AND WE MUST BE

02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:33.805
ABLE OF FOR THE FIFTH LARGEST

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:35.507

TO AFFORD TO PAY FOR THOSE KINDS

02:18:37.909 --> 02:18:39.210
OF SERVICES.

02:18:39.277 --> 02:18:44.015
I DO -- IT DOES MAKE ME THINK

02:18:44.082 --> 02:18:45.216
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

02:18:45.283 --> 02:18:46.418
OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT IS YOU

02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:47.819
KNOW CHEAP THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:49.421
MEAN BEST.

02:18:49.487 --> 02:18:52.957
AND SO YOU KNOW BEST VALUE YOU

02:18:53.024 --> 02:18:53.925
KNOW BECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY DON'T

02:18:53.992 --> 02:18:54.926
WANT TO GET LIKE THE CHEAPEST

02:18:54.993 --> 02:18:56.594
CONTRACT AND THEN THAT MEANS YOU

02:18:56.661 --> 02:18:58.263
KNOW YOU'RE ON A CRICKET OR

02:18:58.329 --> 02:19:01.533

02:19:09.274 --> 02:19:12.711
SHE JUST SLAMMED THE WHOLE I DID

02:19:12.777 --> 02:19:15.914
NOT I TELL A PHONE COMPANY.

02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:17.482
MY GRANDMOTHER HAD A JUNE BUG SO.

02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:19.017
BUT I'M JUST I'M SAYING I ALSO

02:19:19.084 --> 02:19:19.784
HOPE THAT NOT HAVING THE

02:19:19.851 --> 02:19:21.853
CHEAPEST CONTRACT.

02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.655
DOESN'T LIMIT THE VALUE YOU KNOW

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:24.622
INVEST VALUE IS ALSO IMPORTANT

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:25.957
TO BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS A FAMILY

02:19:26.024 --> 02:19:27.325
AND FRIENDS BUT IT'S ALSO

02:19:27.392 --> 02:19:28.827

DUE PROCESS AND THEY HAVE

02:19:37.268 --> 02:19:39.204

IS.

02:19:40.872 --> 02:19:42.207
IN MY OPINION UNCONSCIONABLE SO

02:19:42.273 --> 02:19:43.541

AS WELL AS CONNECTIVITY TO THEIR

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:23.561

02:23:23.628 --> 02:23:24.629
THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN THIS

02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:25.797

REDUCE RECIDIVISM HOW DO WE GET

02:23:27.598 --> 02:23:28.933
PEOPLE TO NOT COMMIT CRIMES TO

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.368
MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER TO

02:23:30.435 --> 02:23:31.536
REDUCE THE AMOUNT WE AS A STATE

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:32.937

AND WE KNOW THE EVIDENCE SHOWS

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:37.308
THAT CONNECTIVITY TO THEIR

02:23:37.375 --> 02:23:39.577

02:23:47.485 --> 02:23:48.653
WE SHOULD DO IT AND THAT WE

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:49.821

02:23:49.887 --> 02:23:51.189
ANYTHING THAT MAKES OUR

02:23:51.255 --> 02:23:52.890

SHERIFFS AND OTHERS WERE

02:24:12.143 --> 02:24:14.112
SUCCESSFUL IN KILLING AN EFFORT

02:24:14.178 --> 02:24:15.546
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN WE

02:24:15.613 --> 02:24:16.481
WERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE

02:24:16.547 --> 02:24:17.682
PEOPLE IN COUNTY JAILS HAD THE

02:24:17.749 --> 02:24:19.417
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE IN PERSON

FINANCIAL -- OUT LIABILITY IN

02:24:29.994 --> 02:24:31.295
THAT MANY COUNTY JAILS NOW ARE

02:24:31.362 --> 02:24:34.298
BEING BUILT WITHOUT IN PERSON

02:24:34.365 --> 02:24:36.200
VISITATION ACCOMMODATIONS SO NOW

PEOPLE ARE BE LIMITED TO EVEN

02:24:37.535 --> 02:24:39.470
HOW THEY CAN HAVE CONTACT WITH

02:24:39.537 --> 02:24:40.405
THEIR LOVED ONES.

02:24:40.471 --> 02:24:41.506
AND IT'S THROUGH PHONE OR

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:43.307
COMPUTER SERVICES NONE OF US

02:24:43.374 --> 02:24:45.143
HERE WOULD KEEP A PHONE PLAN

02:24:45.209 --> 02:24:46.944
THAT CHARGED US SEVENTEEN

02:24:47.011 --> 02:24:48.446
DOLLARS FOR A FIFTEEN MINUTE

02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:49.647

02:24:49.714 --> 02:24:51.249
NOBODY WOULD.

02:24:51.315 --> 02:24:53.284
AND SO WHY THESE CONTRACTS ARE

02:24:53.351 --> 02:24:54.852
ACCEPTABLE.

02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:59.223
IN COUNTY FACILITIES IS BEYOND

02:24:59.290 --> 02:25:00.358
ME.

02:25:00.425 --> 02:25:00.925
SINCE WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN

02:25:00.992 --> 02:25:02.126
ACTION TO LIMIT THE WAY PEOPLE

02:25:02.193 --> 02:25:03.928
COULD HAVE HUMAN CONTACT WITH

02:25:03.995 --> 02:25:05.863
FAMILY MEMBERS.

02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:08.533
WE LIMIT THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO

02:25:08.599 --> 02:25:10.101
WORK IN JAIL TO EARN MONEY.

02:25:10.168 --> 02:25:11.602
WE ARE NOW.

02:25:11.669 --> 02:25:13.571
CHARGING THEM EXORBITANT FEES TO

02:25:13.638 --> 02:25:15.506
TRY TO LIVE HUMANELY WHILE

02:25:15.573 --> 02:25:18.076
INCARCERATED AND TO HAVE PHONE

02:25:18.142 --> 02:25:21.045
CONTACT WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

02:25:21.112 --> 02:25:22.547
WHAT MORE CAN WE ASK FROM THEM?

02:25:22.613 --> 02:25:25.483
I THINK SB FIVE FIVE FIVE IS A

02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:26.851
REASONABLE APPROACH.

02:25:26.918 --> 02:25:27.819
WE ARE NOT ELIMINATING THE

02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:30.021
WEALTH IN MAY WELL FOR FUN WE

02:25:30.088 --> 02:25:31.355

02:25:31.422 --> 02:25:33.124
APPROPRIATE -- TO THOSE WHO ARE

INCARCERATED AND WE'RE GOING TO

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:37.495
LIMIT HOW IT CAN BE USE AND

02:25:37.562 --> 02:25:38.496
WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE SHERIFF'S%

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:40.798
THE MIND THE CONTRACTS THAT THEY

02:25:40.865 --> 02:25:42.300
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FACILITATING.

02:25:42.366 --> 02:25:43.634
JUST AS THEY WOULD THEIR OWN

02:25:43.701 --> 02:25:45.403
CELL PHONE SERVICE OR COMPUTER

02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:47.605
SERVICE OR WHAT THEY WOULD PAY

02:25:47.672 --> 02:25:48.773
FOR DEODORANT AT HOME.

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:50.041
I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE

02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:51.609
EXPECTATION HAVING BEEN AN

02:25:51.676 --> 02:25:53.211
EMPLOYER AND RUN ORGANIZATION TO

02:25:53.277 --> 02:25:56.114

INDENTURED SERVANTS.

02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:15.066
ON THAT WAS USED.

02:26:15.133 --> 02:26:16.667
WHEN YOU DO ACTUALLY PAY SOMEONE

02:26:16.734 --> 02:26:18.035
BUT?

02:26:18.102 --> 02:26:19.270
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE

02:26:19.337 --> 02:26:20.838
COMPANY STORE BECAUSE THEY HAVE

02:26:20.905 --> 02:26:22.206
TO PAY TO USE THE LAND BECAUSE

02:26:22.273 --> 02:26:23.574

GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE. TWENTY

02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:51.255

MATTRESS IN JUVENILE HALL.

02:33:54.592 --> 02:33:56.493
AND I FRANTICALLY WROTE A LETTER

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:58.228
TO THE JUDGE TO ADVOCATE FOR THE

02:33:58.295 --> 02:34:00.030
OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE MY HIGH

02:34:00.097 --> 02:34:01.565
SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:02.666
I SPENT THE MAJORITY OF MY HIGH

02:34:02.733 --> 02:34:04.101
SCHOOL EDUCATION IN AND OUT OF

02:34:04.168 --> 02:34:05.269
JUVENILE HALL AND WAS

02:34:05.336 --> 02:34:06.570
INCARCERATED FOR THE MOST

02:34:06.637 --> 02:34:08.405
CRITICAL YEARS WHEN I WOULD HAVE

02:34:08.472 --> 02:34:09.540
BEEN GOING TO A PROM.

02:34:09.607 --> 02:34:11.575

MY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION

02:34:13.310 --> 02:34:14.745
INSTEAD I WAS LOCKED UP AND

02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:16.313
LOCKED OUT OF THE FUTURE.

02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:18.315
I COULD BARELY SEE A WAY OUT AT

02:34:18.382 --> 02:34:19.650
THAT TIME IN MY LIFE.

02:34:19.717 --> 02:34:21.318
AT THAT TIME THE PRIORITY FOR

02:34:21.385 --> 02:34:22.653
YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE JUVENILE

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:25.122
JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS NOT EDUCATION.

02:34:25.189 --> 02:34:26.690
AND THERE CERTAINLY WAS A DIRECT

02:34:26.757 --> 02:34:28.392
SUPPORT FOR GOING TO COLLEGE

02:34:28.459 --> 02:34:30.027
I'VE FOUGHT HARD TO COMPLETE MY

02:34:30.094 --> 02:34:31.829
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND WHEN I

02:34:31.895 --> 02:34:33.530
WAS RELEASED FROM CUSTODY THE

02:34:33.597 --> 02:34:36.600
IDEA OF COLLEGE WAS THE FURTHEST

02:34:36.667 --> 02:34:37.635
THING FROM MY MIND.

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.069
HOWEVER AFTER A SERIES OF

02:34:39.136 --> 02:34:40.638
UNFORTUNATE EVENTS POST RELEASE

02:34:40.704 --> 02:34:42.139
IT BECAME CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT

02:34:42.206 --> 02:34:44.241
DESPITE NEVER IMAGINING MYSELF

02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:46.043
TO BE COLLEGE MATERIAL.

02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:47.444
I WOULD NEED TO ENROLL IN MY

02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:49.013
LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IF I

02:34:49.079 --> 02:34:50.781
WERE TO EVER HAVE A SHOT AT A

02:34:50.848 --> 02:34:52.182
SUCCESSFUL FUTURE.

02:34:52.249 --> 02:34:54.118
NAVIGATING COLLEGES DIFFICULT

02:34:54.184 --> 02:34:56.520
FOR ANYBODY -- WHEN YOU'RE

02:34:56.587 --> 02:34:57.621
EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES

02:34:57.688 --> 02:34:59.456
DISJOINTED FROM BEING INVOLVED

02:34:59.523 --> 02:35:00.924
IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:35:00.991 --> 02:35:02.393
THE PATH IS PAVED WITH WHAT CAN

02:35:02.459 --> 02:35:03.594
SEEM LIKE INSURMOUNTABLE

02:35:03.661 --> 02:35:04.962
OBSTACLES?

02:35:05.029 --> 02:35:07.297
I WAS REALLY LUCKY THAT I FOUND

02:35:07.364 --> 02:35:09.133
SUPPORTIVE PROFESSORS COMMUNITY

02:35:09.199 --> 02:35:11.035

COMING FROM OTHER CHALLENGING

02:35:12.236 --> 02:35:14.204
EXPERIENCES HE WOULD HELP ME TO

02:35:14.271 --> 02:35:15.472
MAKE IT THROUGH COLLEGE.

02:35:15.539 --> 02:35:16.440
I ENDED UP TRANSFERRING TO THE

02:35:16.507 --> 02:35:17.941
UNIVERSITY OBTAINING MY

02:35:18.008 --> 02:35:19.610
BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND WENT ON TO

02:35:19.677 --> 02:35:20.944
COMPLETE GRADUATE WORK WITH THE

02:35:21.011 --> 02:35:23.347
GOAL TO TEACH AND BE OF SERVICE

02:35:23.414 --> 02:35:24.114
TO OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD

02:35:24.181 --> 02:35:27.451
STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN AN EDUCATION.

02:35:27.518 --> 02:35:28.118
BUT MY EXPERIENCE MAKING IT OUT

02:35:28.185 --> 02:35:29.553
OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:31.021
AND GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE IS A

02:35:31.088 --> 02:35:33.257
RARE WHEN AS STATISTICS TELL US

02:35:33.323 --> 02:35:34.858
MOST YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:35:34.925 --> 02:35:36.226
INCARCERATED AND IN THE JUVENILE

02:35:36.293 --> 02:35:37.695
JUSTICE SYSTEM GOING TO ENTER

02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:39.363
THE ADULT PRISON SYSTEM AND

02:35:39.430 --> 02:35:41.098
RARELY DO THOSE WHO MAKE IT OUR

02:35:41.165 --> 02:35:41.298
EARN.

02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:42.833
A COLLEGE DEGREE IT'S

02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:44.501
OPPORTUNITIES TO PURSUE COLLEGE

02:35:44.568 --> 02:35:46.036
WHILE STILL IN CUSTODY THAT WILL

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:47.571
GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE

02:35:47.638 --> 02:35:48.739
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM A

02:35:48.806 --> 02:35:50.641
PIPELINE TO HIGHER EDUCATION

02:35:50.708 --> 02:35:52.076
RATHER THAN TO PRESS THEM.

02:35:52.142 --> 02:35:53.811
AFTER GRADUATE SCHOOL I RETURNED

02:35:53.877 --> 02:35:55.713
TO MY FORMER COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:35:55.779 --> 02:35:57.081
TO TEACH ENGLISH.

02:35:57.147 --> 02:35:58.615
I DID THIS FOR EIGHT YEARS

02:35:58.682 --> 02:36:00.317
BEFORE CREATING PROJECT CHANGE

02:36:00.384 --> 02:36:01.985
WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE COLLEGE

02:36:02.052 --> 02:36:03.320

02:36:07.624 --> 02:36:08.726
THIS PROGRAM IS THAT THE SAME

02:36:08.792 --> 02:36:09.760
JUVENILE HALL WHERE I WAS ONCE

02:36:09.827 --> 02:36:11.161
INCARCERATED.

02:36:11.228 --> 02:36:12.329

02:36:12.396 --> 02:36:13.964
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROGRAM I

02:36:14.031 --> 02:36:15.699
WORKED ALONGSIDE MY OLD

02:36:15.766 --> 02:36:16.967

BECOME THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THESE

02:36:19.970 --> 02:36:20.704
DECADES LATER.

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:22.072
ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM KNOW THAT

02:36:22.139 --> 02:36:23.640
COLLEGE IS THE POWER TO CHANGE

AND THIS ACCESS IS ESPECIALLY

02:36:44.828 --> 02:36:45.929
IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN

PREVENT FUTURE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

02:37:37.781 --> 02:37:38.715
PROFOUND.

02:37:38.782 --> 02:37:40.117

03:13:14.649 --> 03:13:15.850
POPULATIONS.

03:13:15.917 --> 03:13:16.885
IT'S ONE TYPE OF TREATMENT

03:13:16.952 --> 03:13:18.086
AVAILABLE BUT ANIMAL ABUSE CAN

03:13:18.153 --> 03:13:19.487
BE CONNECTED TO A WIDE RANGE OF

03:13:19.554 --> 03:13:21.289
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.

03:13:21.356 --> 03:13:22.290
AND THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF

03:13:22.357 --> 03:13:23.692
MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT

03:13:23.758 --> 03:13:25.226
CAN HELP ADDRESS THIS.

03:13:25.293 --> 03:13:26.828
WITH THE RANGE OF UNDERLYING

03:13:26.895 --> 03:13:28.463
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

03:13:28.530 --> 03:13:29.397
A MANIFESTING THE KIND OF ANIMAL

03:13:29.464 --> 03:13:30.899
ABUSE IT'S LOGICALFOR

03:13:30.966 --> 03:13:32.434
REHABILITATION OF THE OFFENDER.

03:13:32.500 --> 03:13:34.302
TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC PUBLIC AND

03:13:34.369 --> 03:13:35.236
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MENTAL

03:13:35.303 --> 03:13:39.541
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED IN

03:13:39.607 --> 03:13:40.675
THAT RECOMMENDATION.

03:13:40.742 --> 03:13:42.010
ALSO NOTABLY AT FIVE EIGHTY SO

03:13:42.077 --> 03:13:42.844
LEAVE THE ULTIMATE DISCRETION

03:13:42.911 --> 03:13:43.478
THE HANDS OF THE JUDGE WHO CAN

03:13:43.545 --> 03:13:44.145
BALANCE THAT RECOMMENDATION WITH

03:13:44.212 --> 03:13:46.481
ISSUES OF JUSTICE AND ANY UNIQUE

03:13:46.548 --> 03:13:47.048
CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THE

03:13:47.115 --> 03:13:48.016
OFFENDER.

03:13:48.083 --> 03:13:49.384
THE GOAL OF SUCH EVALUATION AND

03:13:49.451 --> 03:13:51.186
POTENTIALLY TREATMENT IS NOT TO

03:13:51.252 --> 03:13:53.254
PUNISH THE READ THE OFFENDER BUT

03:13:53.321 --> 03:13:53.855
TO PROVIDE HIM OR HER AT THE

03:13:53.922 --> 03:13:55.123
NECESSARY TOOLS TO CHANGE

03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:56.057
BEHAVIOR.

03:13:56.124 --> 03:13:57.792
AND AVOID RE OFFENDING MANDATORY

03:13:57.859 --> 03:13:59.194
COUNSELING PROGRAMS RELATED

03:13:59.260 --> 03:14:01.129
CRIME SUCH AS BATTERIES PROGRAMS

03:14:01.196 --> 03:14:03.231

03:14:03.298 --> 03:14:04.933
BEEN CREATED FOR ANIMAL ABUSE

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:05.734
OFFENSES.

03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:06.334
INSTEAD THE COURTS SENTENCED

03:14:06.401 --> 03:14:08.036
MOST OF THESE OFFENDERS TO THE

03:14:08.103 --> 03:14:09.871
MANDATORY COUNCIL REQUIREMENTS

03:14:09.938 --> 03:14:11.406
IN GENERAL ANGER MANAGEMENT.

03:14:11.473 --> 03:14:12.674
UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THIS CAN

03:14:12.741 --> 03:14:13.908
BE PART OF THE PROBLEM BUT IT'S

03:14:13.975 --> 03:14:15.377
NOT ALWAYS SUFFICIENT ACTUALLY

03:14:15.443 --> 03:14:16.978
ADDRESS UNDERLYING ISSUES.

03:14:17.045 --> 03:14:18.346
SB FIVE EIGHTY WILL BE IMPORTANT

03:14:18.413 --> 03:14:19.814

03:14:21.182 --> 03:14:22.417
CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

03:14:22.484 --> 03:14:24.219
RIGHT NOW TO TAKE STEPS TO

03:14:24.285 --> 03:14:25.687
PROTECT ANIMALS AND THE PUBLIC

03:14:25.754 --> 03:14:27.022
FROM FUTURE VIOLENCE.

03:14:52.514 --> 03:14:54.215
ALMOST GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER

03:14:54.282 --> 03:14:56.451
CHAIR AND MEMBERS SHARON RILEY

03:14:56.518 --> 03:14:58.286
ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL

03:14:58.353 --> 03:15:00.955
COUNCIL IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION

03:15:01.022 --> 03:15:02.924
TO THE BILL AS IT IS CURRENTLY.

03:15:02.991 --> 03:15:07.028
IN PRINT -- BEFORE YOU START AND

03:15:07.095 --> 03:15:09.397
DISCUSS OUR OUR CONCERNS I WOULD

03:15:09.464 --> 03:15:10.799
LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHORS OFFICE

03:15:10.865 --> 03:15:13.635
AND THE SPONSORS -- FOR ENGAGING

03:15:13.701 --> 03:15:15.070
WITH US SENATE BUT UNFORTUNATELY

03:15:15.136 --> 03:15:17.872
AT THIS POINT -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN

03:15:17.939 --> 03:15:19.574
A NAFF -- WE DID RECEIVE THE

03:15:19.641 --> 03:15:22.177
DRAFT AMENDMENTS LATE LAST NIGHT.

03:15:22.243 --> 03:15:24.579
OR LATE AFTERNOON WE HAVEN'T

03:15:24.646 --> 03:15:25.780
REALLY HAD A CHANCE.

03:15:25.847 --> 03:15:27.849
TO DIGEST THEM SO I AM GOING TO

03:15:27.916 --> 03:15:28.917
GO AHEAD AND JUST.

03:15:28.983 --> 03:15:30.618
RAISE THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE

03:15:30.685 --> 03:15:32.253
AS THE BILL IS A CURRENTLY IN

03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:32.854
PRINT.

03:15:32.921 --> 03:15:35.256
SO WHATEVER FIRST CONCERNS IS

03:15:35.323 --> 03:15:38.526
THAT IT REQUIRES JUDGES TO ORDER

03:15:38.593 --> 03:15:40.762
THE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS.

03:15:40.829 --> 03:15:42.997
AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE

03:15:43.064 --> 03:15:44.732
PERMISSIVE IN THAT IT SHOULD BE

03:15:44.799 --> 03:15:46.034
DISCRETIONARY.

03:15:46.101 --> 03:15:47.335
ON BEHALF OF THE COURTS AT THE

03:15:47.402 --> 03:15:48.436
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE AS

03:15:48.503 --> 03:15:49.604
CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

03:15:49.671 --> 03:15:54.175
THERE'S A VERY BROAD RANGE OF OF

03:15:54.242 --> 03:15:56.678
CRIMES THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

03:15:56.744 --> 03:15:58.313
THE MENTAL HEALTH OF VALUE

03:15:58.379 --> 03:15:59.581
MANDATORY MENTAL HEALTH

03:15:59.647 --> 03:16:00.949
EVALUATIONS.

03:16:01.015 --> 03:16:02.784
ANOTHER CONCERN AND I I KNOW

03:16:02.851 --> 03:16:04.319
THAT MY MY COLLEAGUE HERE WILL

03:16:04.385 --> 03:16:05.720
GET INTO IT MORE.

03:16:05.787 --> 03:16:07.222
IS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A

03:16:07.288 --> 03:16:08.890
PSYCHIATRIST OR A CYCLE

03:16:08.957 --> 03:16:11.626
PSYCHOLOGIST TO THE REVIEW.

03:16:11.693 --> 03:16:13.361
AND AN ONGOING -- CHALLENGE THE

03:16:13.428 --> 03:16:15.330
COURTS HAVE ENCOUNTERED IS THE

03:16:15.396 --> 03:16:21.736
AVAILABILITY OF THOSE RESOURCES --

03:16:21.803 --> 03:16:25.173
SO WITH THAT SAID -- WITH THAT

03:16:25.240 --> 03:16:27.809
IN OUR VIEW OF THE FACT THAT NOT

03:16:27.876 --> 03:16:30.044
ALL OF THE NEW MARRIED AND

03:16:30.111 --> 03:16:32.614
CRIMES WOULD.

03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:33.948
LEND THEMSELVES TO A MENTAL

03:16:34.015 --> 03:16:36.017
HEALTH EVALUATION WE THINK THAT

03:16:36.084 --> 03:16:37.919
WOULD BE AN UNFORTUNATE -- USE

03:16:37.986 --> 03:16:39.721
OF COURT RESOURCES TO GO DOWN

03:16:39.787 --> 03:16:42.790
THIS PATH PARTICULARLY BECAUSE

03:16:42.857 --> 03:16:44.325
UNDER EXISTING LAW IF A COURT

03:16:44.392 --> 03:16:45.493
ORDERS THE MENTAL HEALTH

03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:47.996
EVALUATION THE COURT MUST PAY

03:16:48.062 --> 03:16:50.899
FOR IT -- WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED

03:16:50.965 --> 03:16:52.600
ABOUT THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY

03:16:52.667 --> 03:16:53.868
WRITTEN.

03:16:53.935 --> 03:16:55.503
IT APPEARS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE

03:16:55.570 --> 03:16:57.172
THE EVALUATION TO BE ORDERED

03:16:57.238 --> 03:16:58.973
AFTER CONVICTION AND SENTENCE

03:16:59.040 --> 03:17:01.943
SCENE -- ORDINARILY WE WOULD SEE

03:17:02.010 --> 03:17:04.379
SOMETHING LIKE THIS PERHAPS.

03:17:04.445 --> 03:17:06.347
AFTER CONVICTION BUT PRIOR TO

03:17:06.414 --> 03:17:07.415
CERTAIN SCENES WHAT COULD BE

03:17:07.482 --> 03:17:08.783
PART OF THE PROBATION.

03:17:08.850 --> 03:17:13.054
REPORT AND THEN FINALLY -- THE

03:17:13.121 --> 03:17:15.323
PROVISIONS RELATING TO ABILITY

03:17:15.390 --> 03:17:16.558
TO PAY AND WHEN SOMEBODY IS NOT

03:17:16.624 --> 03:17:19.661
ABLE TO PAY WHO IS GOING TO STEP

03:17:19.727 --> 03:17:21.429
IN AND PAY FOR THE COUNSELING --

03:17:21.496 --> 03:17:23.031
WE BELIEVE ARE UNCLEAR.

03:17:23.097 --> 03:17:24.165
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:17:24.232 --> 03:17:25.733
THANK YOU.

03:17:25.800 --> 03:17:27.302
AND THEN GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND

03:17:27.368 --> 03:17:29.003
MEMBERS -- BUT IT'S STILL

03:17:29.070 --> 03:17:32.106
MORNING -- TYLER IN THE WITH THE

03:17:32.173 --> 03:17:32.907

03:17:32.974 --> 03:17:34.609
DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WHILE WE

03:17:34.676 --> 03:17:35.677
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND

03:17:35.743 --> 03:17:37.378
SPONSORS INTENT TO ADDRESS THE

03:17:37.445 --> 03:17:38.846
LINK BETWEEN ANIMAL CRUELTY AND

03:17:38.913 --> 03:17:40.348
THEN THE POTENTIAL.

03:17:40.415 --> 03:17:42.483
FOR VIOLENCE TOWARDS ON HUMANS

03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:46.487
WE ARE REGRETFULLY OPPOSED TO SB

03:17:46.554 --> 03:17:47.121
FIVE EIGHTY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

03:17:47.188 --> 03:17:48.756
UNDULY TIES THE HAND OF COURTS

03:17:48.823 --> 03:17:49.958
AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:17:50.024 --> 03:17:51.326
PRACTITIONERS.

03:17:51.392 --> 03:17:52.827
I'D LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS

03:17:52.894 --> 03:17:54.796
WITHOUT AROUND BACK CALL THAT MY

03:17:54.862 --> 03:17:56.030
COLLEAGUE FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL

03:17:56.097 --> 03:17:59.367
MEN OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE TO YOU --

03:17:59.434 --> 03:18:01.236
WHILE IT SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE

03:18:01.302 --> 03:18:04.505
THE LINKED A UNDERLYING MENTAL

03:18:04.572 --> 03:18:06.841
HEALTH DIAGNOSIS -- TO VIOLENCE

03:18:06.908 --> 03:18:08.943
TOWARD ANIMALS NOT ALL OF THE

03:18:09.010 --> 03:18:10.778
CRIMES ENUMERATED WITH IN THIS

03:18:10.845 --> 03:18:13.815
BILL A FOLK THE SAME -- MENTAL

03:18:13.881 --> 03:18:15.550
HEALTH CONCERNS ADDS THAT SOME

03:18:15.617 --> 03:18:17.018
OF THE OTHERS SPECIFICALLY

03:18:17.085 --> 03:18:18.686
CRIMES RELATED TO IMPROPERLY

03:18:18.753 --> 03:18:20.288
CARING FOR ANY ANIMAL OVER

03:18:20.355 --> 03:18:21.723
WORKING AN ANIMAL OR EVEN

03:18:21.789 --> 03:18:23.358
INJURING A POLICE DOG MAY NOT BE

03:18:23.424 --> 03:18:24.792
LINKED TO AN UNDERLYING MENTAL

03:18:24.859 --> 03:18:25.960
ILLNESS.

03:18:26.027 --> 03:18:27.795
INTO THE MANDATORY NATURE OF

03:18:27.862 --> 03:18:29.497
THIS WOULD AND UP UTILIZING

03:18:29.564 --> 03:18:31.299
COURT RESOURCES TO FIND THAT

03:18:31.366 --> 03:18:35.670
THERE WAS NOT AN UNDERMINE

03:18:35.737 --> 03:18:37.538
MENTAL ILLNESS -- ALSO

03:18:37.605 --> 03:18:38.239
ADDITIONALLY WHEN I'VE BEEN

03:18:38.306 --> 03:18:39.574
TALKING WITH SOME OF OUR FOLKS

03:18:39.641 --> 03:18:40.475
ON MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

03:18:40.541 --> 03:18:41.376
THEY WERE SAYING THAT MOST

03:18:41.442 --> 03:18:42.644
LIKELY WHAT THE UNDERLYING CAUSE

03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:44.746
OF THIS -- IF IT IS A MENTAL

03:18:44.812 --> 03:18:46.180
HEALTH DIAGNOSIS IS A

03:18:46.247 --> 03:18:47.282
PERSONALITY DISORDER

03:18:47.348 --> 03:18:49.284
PARTICULARLY ANTISOCIAL

03:18:49.350 --> 03:18:50.885
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

03:18:50.952 --> 03:18:52.553
AND IN CASES WHERE -- MENTAL

03:18:52.620 --> 03:18:54.222
HEALTH IS SUSPECTED AS THE CAUSE

03:18:54.289 --> 03:18:57.659
OF THE CRIME AND AB EIGHTEEN TEN

03:18:57.725 --> 03:18:58.993
LAST YEAR MAN HOW TO VERSION LAW

03:18:59.060 --> 03:19:00.928
WAS PASSED WITH X. -- THE STATE

03:19:00.995 --> 03:19:04.532
HAS EXPRESSIVELY EXCLUDED --

03:19:04.599 --> 03:19:06.501
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER

03:19:06.567 --> 03:19:07.902
AND SO IF THE PERSON'S NOT

03:19:07.969 --> 03:19:11.372
ELIGIBLE FOR THE VERSION THAN IN

03:19:11.439 --> 03:19:13.541
THEIR CONVICTED UNDER THIS PSALM

03:19:13.608 --> 03:19:14.742
ONE OF THESE OFFENSES THEY WOULD

03:19:14.809 --> 03:19:16.110
HAVE TO GO UNDERGO ANOTHER

03:19:16.177 --> 03:19:19.113
PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION -- WHICH

03:19:19.180 --> 03:19:20.815
WOULD BE DUPLICATIVE OF WHAT

03:19:20.882 --> 03:19:21.849
THEY'D ALREADY RECEIVED.

03:19:21.916 --> 03:19:24.085
WE ALSO -- LIKE TO MENTION THAT

03:19:24.152 --> 03:19:25.787
THERE IS A CURRENTLY A SHORTAGE

03:19:25.853 --> 03:19:27.855
OF INDIVIDUALS ABLE TO CONDUCT

03:19:27.922 --> 03:19:29.724
MENTAL HEALTH OR PSYCHIATRIC

03:19:29.791 --> 03:19:31.159
EVALUATIONS ACROSS THE STATE.

03:19:31.225 --> 03:19:32.827
ESPECIALLY IN SMALLER COUNTIES

03:19:32.894 --> 03:19:34.629
WHERE -- THAT APARTMENTS I

03:19:34.696 --> 03:19:35.763
REPRESENT ARE THE ONES THAT

03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:38.499
NORMALLY CONDUCT THE EVALUATIONS.

03:19:38.566 --> 03:19:39.467
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL

03:19:39.534 --> 03:19:41.803
WOULD ADD AN UNDUE WORKLOAD --

03:19:41.869 --> 03:19:42.804
TO WHAT IS ALREADY AN

03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:44.906
OVERBURDENED SYSTEM IT WITH THE

03:19:44.972 --> 03:19:47.775
AMOUNT OF COMPETENCY EVALUATIONS

03:19:47.842 --> 03:19:50.378
THAT -- THE COURTS ARE SEEN AND

03:19:50.445 --> 03:19:52.180
THE COUNTIES ARE CONDUCTING AN

03:19:52.246 --> 03:19:53.981
AND WE ARE AS I'M SURE OF THE

03:19:54.048 --> 03:19:55.483
COMMITTEE AS WELL WHERE YOU KNOW

CONVERSATION.

03:23:29.230 --> 03:23:30.932

03:24:15.543 --> 03:24:17.378
GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT THIS.

03:24:17.445 --> 03:24:22.183

TORTURING THEM [inaudible]

03:24:24.785 --> 03:24:28.389
