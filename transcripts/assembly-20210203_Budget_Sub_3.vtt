YEAR L. P. F. AND THIS IS

00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:12.009
PARTLY BECAUSE THE MEDICATION

COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER- THE

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.232
FIRST IS IT WOULD BE AN OPTION

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:42.940
TO SIMPLY SWAP. THE LPF- AND

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:44.441

THAT ALLOW YOU FORGET TO

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:47.945
GENERAL OF TO FUND THE- OTHER

AMOUNT OF THE LPF OTHER

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:53.183
PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET THAT ARE

ALLOWABLE USES OF THE L. P. ARE

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.889
CONCERNED EXAMPLE MIGHT BE. A

MAINTENANCE PROJECTS IN NET

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:03.660
NEUTRAL- ACTION THAT WOULD

00:46:03.727 --> 00:46:04.761
ALLOW THE FUNDING OF THE

00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:06.430
PROJECT BUT THEN ALSO WOULD

CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINE

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:21.011
CONDITION SO WE COULD ALSO

00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:25.749
OFFER A SECOND OPTION- IN THAT

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:26.884
IT. IS TO. TAKE THE COST FOR

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:29.920

WELL AS THE GENERAL FUND-THAT

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:45.769
WOULD HAVE BOTH THE BENEFIT OF

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:47.538
REDUCING COSTS FROM THE LPF.

00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:49.540
AND THEN ALSO- WOULD HAVE A

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:50.841
TRADE OFF THOUGH- IF YOU WOULD

ONE TIME COSTS. FOR THOSE OTHER

00:46:56.113 --> 00:46:58.115
FINES. THE END THAT WE CAN GET

00:46:58.182 --> 00:47:00.184
IN THE- THE FACT THAT THAT FOUR

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.286

THE GAP IS SMALLEST

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.270
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT THAT

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.572
MAKES SENSE WE CHARGE

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.783
THE 73% NUMBER. FIGURE

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:43.085
INDICATES THE LEVEL OF SERVICE

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:46.489

WHERE OUR GAPS ARE LARGEST IN

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:02.772
OUR SERVICE CURRENTLY IS THE

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:04.273
LEAST RELATIVE TO OUR MISSION.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.842
ADD THIS TO WHILE FOR ME

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.911
EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING IS

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:10.880
SOMEWHAT NOT SURPRISING. THE

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:12.315
GROWTH OF THE DEPARTMENT

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.617

YEARS AGO A HUNDRED YEARS AGO

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:28.764
ON BUSTING THE HUNTER IN THE

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.433

MUCH MORE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.442
THEN WE COULD HAVE CONTEMPLATED

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.811
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO- WHEN THE

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:43.179
BOARD OF FIFTIES COMMISSIONERS

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:45.114

CONSERVATION I'VE ALSO BEEN

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:53.089
MORE RECENTLY THE HISTORICAL

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:55.458
AREAS HARDEST. TO FIND A

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.893

NOW DESCRIBES FOCUSED ON HOURS

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:13.075

THOUGH THAT IS ACTUALLY AN

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:24.720
ARENA WHERE WE'RE DOING THE

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:28.591
MOST LABOR HOURS. THAT'S THE

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:31.193

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.130
PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT. OUR

HISTORICALLY WE'VE BEEN

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:54.250

ACCOMPLISH ABOUT 36% OF OUR

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:24.880

HERE THAT THERE IS LIKE NO

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:26.862
PROPOSAL THERE IS NO SUGGESTION

PARTICULARLY BRUTAL AT A MOMENT

01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:58.754
IN TIME. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:01.256

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:46.468
OTHER ANIMALS EACH YEAR. WE CAN

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.203
INVEST IN DOING THINGS LIKE

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.472
CONSTRUCTING MORE TRAPS FOR

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:51.740
MOUNT LINES SO THAT WHEN WE

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:54.309
CAPTURE AMOUNT LANDED SEDATED

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:55.577
IN SOMEONE'S BACKYARD IN LOS

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:58.213

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.514
QUICKLY AND MOVE THAT ANIMAL

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:01.550
BACK INTO THE WILDERNESS WE

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:02.818
WOULD TAKE FOUR POINT FIVE

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:04.453
MILLION DOLLARS AND PURCHASED A

EIGHTIES AN ADDITIONAL PLANE

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:14.262
WOULD BE A PRUDENT INVESTMENT

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:15.430
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO INCREASE

01:17:15.497 --> 01:17:17.466
OUR WORK FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:18.867

AUTOMATED MACHINES WILL MANAGE

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:52.234
OUR STAFF HOURS BETTER. AND

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:56.838

ANYONE HAS EVER BEEN DIRECTOR

FEED ITSELF OUT OF THIS

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:32.934
CHALLENGE NO INDIVIDUAL SECTOR

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.903
COULD CARRY SUCH A FEE LOAD.

01:24:34.969 --> 01:24:37.972
AND THE GENERAL FUND ITSELF IS.

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:40.475
A VERY IMPORTANT FUND FOR SO

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.243
MANY PURPOSES ACROSS GOVERNMENT.

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:47.882
AND. IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.284
MIGHT BE AN ADDITIVE

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.818

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.751
OVER THE YEARS THIS IS NOTHING

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:32.120

ON FIRST AROUND THE- PACKED WE

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.278
IT'S REASONABLE THE DEPARTMENT

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:32.080
IS PROVIDED THE JUSTIFICATION

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:33.381
FOR EACH OF THE EXPENDITURES

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:34.549
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S THE

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.017
ONLY APPROACH THAT YOU COULD

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:37.385
TAKE YOU COULD TAKE A

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:40.154
DIFFERENT- MIX OF ACTIVITIES

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:41.623
THAT AREN'T PROPOSED INCLUDING

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:42.557
SOME THAT MIGHT FOCUS MORE

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.225
DIRECTLY ON THE SPECIES AND

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:46.861
HABITAT CONSERVATION AREA YOU

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.496
CAN ALSO EVEN PICK WITHIN THE

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:49.764
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:51.199
PLACE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:52.166
EMPHASIS ON DIFFERENT

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:54.502
ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLE I DID

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:55.870
GET A LITTLE BIT MORE FUNDING

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:57.472
TO THE VEGETATION MAPPING WHICH

01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:58.706
REALLY DOES GET SPECIFICALLY AT

01:27:58.773 --> 01:27:59.874
THAT SPECIES HABITAT

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:02.110
CONSERVATION ACTIVITY. UNLESS

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:04.512
IN ANOTHER AREA OF THE SECOND

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:06.648
COMMENT AROUND THE SMALLEST

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:10.318

FISHING AND HUNTING LICENSE

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:13.488
MODERNIZATION SEEMS LIKE A

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:14.956
WORTHWHILE ACTIVITY BUT IT ALSO

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.290
SEEMS LIKE AN ACTIVITY THAT

01:28:16.357 --> 01:28:17.859
COULD VERY JUSTIFIABLY BE

01:28:17.925 --> 01:28:19.994
FUNDED BY FEES FROM HUNTERS AND

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:21.162
ANGLERS SINCE THEY ARE THE

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:22.864
PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES OF THOSE

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:25.433
ACTIVITIES SO- WE RECOMMEND YOU

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.601
MIGHT WANT TO ASK THE

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:27.802
DEPARTMENT TO GO BACK AND LOOK

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:28.903
AND SEE IF THERE IS OTHER FEE

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.705
REVENUE THAT COULD BE USED IN

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:32.106
LIEU OF GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT

01:28:32.173 --> 01:28:33.641

01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:35.476
OF THAT ACTIVITY- IF IT'S

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:36.611
SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO ADOPT

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:38.179
BEFORE THE END OF THE- BUDGET.

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:40.548
DISCUSSIONS AND THEN FINALLY A

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:41.849
THIRD POINT IS REALLY WHAT WHAT

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.184

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:45.219
BEEN ALREADY REALLY ENCOURAGING

STARTING TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF

01:40:46.673 --> 01:40:48.409
THE LIMITATIONS OF THE DATA.

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:50.611
THAT IS AVAILABLE AND WE ARE

01:40:50.677 --> 01:40:53.013
GONNA HAVE TO MAKE. IMPORTANT

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.482
IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT DATA AND

01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:57.217
THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT DATA.

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:58.752
WHICH WE ALREADY WHICH WE

01:40:58.819 --> 01:41:00.788
ALREADY ARE WHICH IS GOOD NEWS

01:41:00.854 --> 01:41:02.790
BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO

01:41:02.856 --> 01:41:05.592
THAT AS MUCH AS IMPLEMENTED A

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:07.628
TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON THE

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:09.930
ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT- IS YOU

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:12.766
KNOW ONCE PLANS ARE- DEEMED

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:15.869
ADEQUATE OR- DEEMED INADEQUATE

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:18.872
AND THAT- MOVES THE PLAN INTO

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:19.473
THE JURISDICTION OF THE WATER

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.609
BOARD- FOR RESOLUTION BUT- FOR

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:23.844
PLANS THAT ARE ADEQUATE. THEY

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:25.579
ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ANNUAL

01:41:25.646 --> 01:41:28.348
REPORTS- BUT THEN EVERY FIVE

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:31.652
YEARS IS A FULL SCALE REVIEW OF

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:32.886
THOSE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT

01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:38.125
PLANS SO THOSE PLANS. THAT ARE-

01:41:38.192 --> 01:41:42.362
BUT LEE- OVERLY ROSY ABOUT THE

01:41:42.429 --> 01:41:43.797
AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL

01:41:43.864 --> 01:41:46.767
WATER- WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:48.335
ALSO IN THOSE PLANS AND

01:41:48.402 --> 01:41:50.471
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF IF THAT

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:52.473
WATER DOES NOT BECOME AVAILABLE

01:41:52.539 --> 01:41:53.540
WHAT ARE THEIR DEMAND

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:58.011
MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO- TO

01:41:58.078 --> 01:41:59.746
ENSURE THAT THEIR

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:01.482
IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR PLAN

01:42:01.548 --> 01:42:03.283
WILL RESULT IN SUSTAINABILITY

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:05.652
AT THE END OF THE- TWENTY YEAR

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:09.823
PERIOD. AS A GENERAL MATTER-

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:11.358
YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY WANT TO

01:42:11.425 --> 01:42:14.962
SUPPORT. AS MANY COMMUNITY USES

01:42:15.028 --> 01:42:18.432
AS ALL THE BENEFICIAL USES AS

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:21.902
AS POSSIBLE IN THESE AREAS WITH

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:23.937
A HEALTHY GROUNDWATER BASINS SO

01:42:24.004 --> 01:42:25.138
I THINK IT'S NATURAL AS YOU

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:27.307
POINT OUT THAT- A LOT OF THESE

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:29.076
PLANS YOU KNOW THEIR FIRST STEP

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:30.878
IS TO WELL LET'S LOOK AND SEE

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:32.145
WHAT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS WE

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:34.014
CAN MAKE. AND PROJECTS THAT

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:35.148
WOULD IMPROVE THE WATER

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:36.817
SUPPLIES COMING INTO THESE

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:38.552
AREAS BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:39.686
WE'RE WE'RE VERY MUCH

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:41.455
CHALLENGED BY RESOURCE SCARCITY

01:42:41.522 --> 01:42:43.190
ISSUE SO WHAT PASSED THE COME

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:46.426
IN AND- IN TANDEM WITH THAT ARE

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:48.829
REALLY CREDIBLE PLANS TO-

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:51.465
MANAGE DEMAND- MORE FULLY SO

01:42:51.532 --> 01:42:53.934
THAT- AS THE PLAN IS

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:55.035
IMPLEMENTED OVER THE NEXT

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:56.203
TWENTY YEARS. THERE'S

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:58.472
TRANSPARENCY AND CLARITY ABOUT

01:42:58.539 --> 01:43:00.274
HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:04.945
SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER. SOURCE

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:05.579
FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA. IT IT IF

01:43:05.646 --> 01:43:08.282
YOU COULD INSTALL UP IN THAT IS

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:10.817
JUST TO EMPHASIZE OF THE

01:43:10.884 --> 01:43:13.120
TREMENDOUS OF IMPORTANCE OF

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:15.489
YOUR ROLE IN. KEEPING THOSE

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:17.190
PLANS CREDIBLE YOU TALKED ABOUT

YOU KNOW WHETHER THE PLAN IS

01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:19.826
ADEQUATE OR NOT THAT'S THE

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:21.528
THAT'S REALLY WANTS A PLAN GETS

01:43:21.595 --> 01:43:22.629
IDENTIFIED IS NOT ADEQUATE

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.231
THAT'S- A LOT OF THINGS CAN

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:25.966
HAPPEN BUT- TO MAKE SURE THE-

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:27.134

THAT THERE'S TREMENDOUS

01:43:42.115 --> 01:43:44.017
PRESSURE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.786
TRY TO DE IDENTIFY THESE PLANS

01:43:45.852 --> 01:43:48.889

ADDRESS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:44:32.499 --> 01:44:34.468
WHICH WAS AND THE ITEMS ARE

HEARD BUT THEN. ALSO IN IN LOOK

01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:39.306
UP LARGER WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:40.841
PROJECTS- THAT THESE

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:42.175
COMMUNITIES NEED TO TAKE THAT

01:44:42.242 --> 01:44:43.877
MAY NOT BE DONE THE AND- IN A

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:45.512
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND THAT

01:44:45.579 --> 01:44:46.647
MAY GET A LOT OF THESE

YOU GUYS VIEW. CIGNA THROUGH

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:04.097
THE NEED FOR. LARGER WATER

01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:06.033
INFRASTRUCTURE STORAGE PROJECTS.

01:45:06.099 --> 01:45:11.104
ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S A GREAT.

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:13.540
IT IS INTEGRATING OUR WATER

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:15.676
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT NEEDS WITH

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:18.045
CIGNA IS- THE GOVERNOR'S WATER

RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO. AND YOU

01:45:20.447 --> 01:45:21.848
MENTIONED A COUPLE OF THINGS

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:24.184
YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE- THE STATE

01:45:24.251 --> 01:45:25.752
WATER PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE PLAYS

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:27.087
A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:28.655
PROVIDING SURFACE WATER TO

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:30.724
COMMUNITIES THAT- COULD BE

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.726
AVAILABLE FOR RECHARGE. THE

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.861
WATER TRANSFER PROGRAM THAT-

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:37.831
ASSEMBLY MEMBER- BENNETT.

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:41.468
RAISED AS WELL- T. W. R. IS-

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:43.637
WORKING ON A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:45.105
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:47.340
TRANSPARENCY OF. THE WATER

01:45:47.407 --> 01:45:49.109
TRANSFER PROGRAM SO THAT WE

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:51.778
CAN- GET THROUGH THEM THIS THIS

01:45:51.845 --> 01:45:53.547
YEAR IS A DRY HERE AND WE'RE

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:55.082
ANTICIPATING A VERY ACTIVE

01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:56.917
WATER TRANSFER MARKET WHICH

01:45:56.983 --> 01:46:00.353
WOULD BE TYPICAL- BUT WE ARE-

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.456
UNDERWEIGHT AND EXPANDING THE

01:46:02.522 --> 01:46:04.958
TRANSFER. MARKET AS IT RELATES

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:07.160
TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT- WE

01:46:07.227 --> 01:46:11.031
DO HAVE WE HAVE RECENTLY

01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:12.165
AMENDED OUR STATE WATER. ROGIC

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:14.801
CONTRACTS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR

01:46:14.868 --> 01:46:17.471
LONGER TERM TRANSFERS AND- A

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:19.506
HUGE BENEFIT OF THAT IS HOW

01:46:19.573 --> 01:46:22.843
THAT WORKS- WITH SOME OF THE-

01:46:22.909 --> 01:46:24.544
WATER RECHARGING NEEDS

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:25.879
PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTRAL

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:27.547
VALLEY SO THAT'S THAT'S JUST

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:29.015
ONE EXAMPLE THERE'S OTHER

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:30.517
ELEMENTS WITHIN THE WATER

01:46:30.584 --> 01:46:32.786
RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO- THE

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:35.388
CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION- IS

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:37.758
WORKING ON- STUDYING. WHAT WE

01:46:37.824 --> 01:46:39.626
CALL REGIONAL CONVEYANCE SO

01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:41.228
WHAT WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONAL

01:46:41.294 --> 01:46:43.430
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN

01:46:43.497 --> 01:46:45.332
PARTICULAR REGIONS THAT WOULD.

01:46:45.398 --> 01:46:46.566
IN WORKING WITH A TRANSFER

01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:49.202
PROGRAM AND WORKING WITH OTHER

01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:51.037
BROADER BACKBONE AGING

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:52.139
INFRASTRUCTURE KINDS OF

01:46:52.205 --> 01:46:54.908
INVESTMENTS HELP US MOVE WATER

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.777
TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE SO

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:57.911
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT ALTHOUGH IT

01:46:57.978 --> 01:46:59.579
THESE THINGS NEED TO BE WORKING

01:46:59.646 --> 01:47:01.915
TOGETHER. AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE

01:47:01.982 --> 01:47:04.151
ENOUGH- YOU KNOW THE BIG

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:05.719
CHALLENGE THAT I THINK YOU KNOW

01:47:05.786 --> 01:47:08.321
WE'RE ALL ACUTELY AWARE US. IN

01:47:08.388 --> 01:47:12.692
CALIFORNIA WITH THIS KIND OF A

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:13.994
RESOURCE SCARCITY ISSUE. AS YOU

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:14.861
KNOW SOME OF THESE SOME OF

01:47:14.928 --> 01:47:16.029
THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:18.765
DECADES IN THE MAKING AND-

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:20.433
WHAT'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.335
ESSENTIAL IS HOW WELL WE

01:47:22.402 --> 01:47:25.272
IMPLEMENT THESE PLANS- AND THE

01:47:25.338 --> 01:47:27.607
DEPARTMENT IS. FULLY COMMITTED

01:47:27.674 --> 01:47:29.810
TO THAT THERE'S A LOT OF- I

01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:32.279
WOULD SAY GENERAL ANXIETY ABOUT

01:47:32.345 --> 01:47:33.380
YOU KNOW THE ADEQUACY

01:47:33.446 --> 01:47:36.082
DETERMINATION AND THAT'S

01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:38.118
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DECISION

01:47:38.185 --> 01:47:39.386
THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:42.189
MAKE IT NEEDS TO BE DECISIONS

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:45.559
THAT ARE- OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE

01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:48.028
OF TECHNICAL INTEGRITY- THAT

01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:51.331
MEET THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW. BUT

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:53.300
ULTIMATELY. WE REALLY ROLL UP

01:47:53.366 --> 01:47:55.068
OUR SLEEVES AND IMPLEMENT THESE

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:57.304
PLANS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL

01:47:57.370 --> 01:47:58.805
GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:01.041
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DRIVE A

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:03.276
LOT OF IMPORTANT DECISIONS ON

01:48:03.343 --> 01:48:05.812
HOW WE'RE MANAGING THIS WATER

01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:07.714
RESOURCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT

01:48:07.781 --> 01:48:11.017
CERTAINLY NEEDS TO SUPPORT-

01:48:11.084 --> 01:48:12.152
LOCAL ECONOMIES AND LOCAL

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:14.721
COMMUNITIES AND ENSURE THAT OUR

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:17.090
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- HAVE

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:20.560
ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND THIS

01:48:20.627 --> 01:48:21.561
CAN REALLY BE A TOOL TO HELP

02:04:34.633 --> 02:04:36.068
SERVICE BASED BUDGETING AND

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:37.703
ANALYSIS BECAUSE IT MIRRORS A

02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:39.672
LOT OF THE PERFORMANCE SPACE-

02:04:39.738 --> 02:04:41.207
METRICS AND THAT WE HAVE BUILT

02:04:41.273 --> 02:04:44.076
INTO OUR PROGRAM NEARLY TEN

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:44.777
YEARS AGO NOW AND CONTINUE TO

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:46.679
REFINE. THAT SO WE HAVE A LOT

02:04:46.745 --> 02:04:48.314
OF WHICH IS TO TELL ALL STATE

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:50.216
THAT CAN HELP US KIND OF A

02:04:50.282 --> 02:04:52.318
SCHOOL ABOUT WHAT POTENTIALLY

02:04:52.384 --> 02:04:53.319
BUT THE DOLLARS AND THE

02:04:53.385 --> 02:04:55.287
POSITIONS YOU KNOW MEAN AND SO

02:04:55.354 --> 02:04:56.255
FAR AND SO FAR AS NUMBER

02:04:56.322 --> 02:04:58.224
PROJECTS TO BE COMPLETED YOU

02:04:58.290 --> 02:04:59.291
KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT BACKLOG

02:04:59.358 --> 02:05:00.860
CAN COME DOWN. WE CAN WILL

02:05:00.926 --> 02:05:02.094
CIRCLE BACK WITH SOME OF THAT

02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:03.662
DATA I'LL JUST SAY THAT MUCH OF

02:05:03.729 --> 02:05:05.497
THAT IS IN HINDSIGHT- IT'S HARD

02:05:05.564 --> 02:05:06.866
SOMETIMES PROJECTING OUT SOME

02:05:06.932 --> 02:05:08.267
OF THAT WORK PARTICULARLY WITH

02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:09.368
STATE EMERGING CONTAMINANTS

02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:11.570
LIKE G. FAST- BECAUSE WE'RE

02:05:11.637 --> 02:05:12.972
STILL NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT THE

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:15.274
COST YOU KNOW THE COSTS VARY

02:05:15.341 --> 02:05:16.242
FROM A HUNDRED THOUSAND TO

02:05:16.308 --> 02:05:18.777
MILLIONS. PER SITE AND THEN YOU

02:05:18.844 --> 02:05:20.579
KNOW THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF A

02:05:20.646 --> 02:05:22.314
CONTAMINATION IS ALWAYS VERY

02:05:22.381 --> 02:05:23.616
PROJECT SPECIFIC SO IT'S A

02:05:23.682 --> 02:05:25.885
LITTLE HARD TO SORT OF FORECAST

02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:27.152
OUT WHAT THE RESOURCE IS

02:05:27.219 --> 02:05:28.754
EXACTLY WILL GET US BUT I THINK

02:05:28.821 --> 02:05:30.556
WE CAN GET SOME SENSE AT LEAST

02:05:30.623 --> 02:05:32.625
AND AT LEAST THROUGH HINDSIGHT

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:33.626
FROM WHAT WE'VE ENCOUNTERED

02:05:33.692 --> 02:05:35.461
PREVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW I WILL I

02:05:35.527 --> 02:05:36.295
WILL ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN IT COMES

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:38.430
TO P. FACET IS STILL AN

02:05:38.497 --> 02:05:40.266
EMERGING CONTAMINANT CONCERNED

02:05:40.332 --> 02:05:42.001
BUT WE'VE TAKEN REAL FACED A

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:44.570
REAL PHASED APPROACH AND-

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:45.838
TRYING O ON EARTH WHERE PEOPLE

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:47.406
ASK CONTAMINATION IS REALLY

02:05:47.473 --> 02:05:48.340
STARTING WITH THE MOST OBVIOUS

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:50.876
SITES LIKE AIRPORTS. AND

02:05:50.943 --> 02:05:53.312
FIREFIGHTING- AREAS WHERE

02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:55.114
FIREFIGHTING FOAM WERE USED-

02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:56.515
WHICH WE KNOW HOW TO CONTAIN

02:05:56.582 --> 02:05:58.217
HIGH AMOUNTS OF LUCKY FAST BUT

02:05:58.284 --> 02:06:00.019
ALSO WITH PRO PLAYERS AND NOW

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:00.886
MOVING ON TO WASTE WATER

02:06:00.953 --> 02:06:02.621
TREATMENT PLANTS- AND BETTER

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:04.023
UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT AND

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:05.724
EFFLUENT CONCENTRATIONS OF THE

02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:07.326
FASTER KNOWING THAT. ARE THERE

02:06:07.393 --> 02:06:08.460
IS SO MUCH YOU KNOW IN OUR

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:11.664
CLOTHES AND STILL IN MODERN-

02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:13.599
GARMENTS THAT- MAY BE A SOURCE

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:16.468
AND SO AGAIN THE COST THERE THE

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:19.605
TIME AND- IT'S STILL AT WORST

02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:21.573
OFF THE FOREFRONT OF THAT SO-

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:23.475
SCOPING IT OUT- WHAT WE'LL DO

02:06:23.542 --> 02:06:30.249
OUR BEST. AND AGAIN- THE

02:06:30.316 --> 02:06:32.418
RESPONSE TO AND YES I ON. WHEN

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:33.552
IT COMES TO RISK. PARTY IT IS

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:34.987
ALWAYS SO. TO ENSURE WE IMPORT.

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:36.822
GET TO AND FINE AND KEEP. WE'RE

02:06:36.889 --> 02:06:38.791
PARTIES FOR. THE DEGRADATION

02:06:38.857 --> 02:06:39.458
THAT THEY'VE CREATED IN THE

02:06:39.525 --> 02:06:41.060
HARM TO BENEFICIAL USES OF

02:06:41.126 --> 02:06:43.062
OTHER OTHER USERS INCLUDING

02:06:43.128 --> 02:06:43.996
MOST IMPORTANTLY DRINKING WATER

02:06:44.063 --> 02:06:45.731
FOR ALL OF US- YOU KNOW IT'S

02:06:45.798 --> 02:06:47.166
NOT BARED ON RATE PAYERS IS NOT

02:06:47.232 --> 02:06:48.500
BARED ON. ON THE STATE BUT

02:06:48.567 --> 02:06:50.469
INSTEAD THOSE WHO. OPERATED THE

02:06:50.536 --> 02:06:52.604
CONTAMINATION TO BEGIN WITH-

02:06:52.671 --> 02:06:54.640
SO. YES AS A- COMPLETE

02:06:54.707 --> 02:06:55.607
PRINCIPLE THAT'S ALWAYS

02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:57.276
ADJACENT WOULD BE FAST. I'VE

02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:58.944
SEEN SOME REALLY ACTION I THINK

02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:00.612
FROM FROM SOME WATER DISTRICTS

02:07:00.679 --> 02:07:01.647
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS

02:07:01.714 --> 02:07:03.816
POINT- NATIONALLY AS WELL I

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:04.717
KNOW SOME STATES HAVE.

02:07:04.783 --> 02:07:06.885
UNDERTAKEN WORK. AND I KNOW. WE

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:10.990
CONTINUE TO. HAVE DISCUSSIONS

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:12.591
AROUND. GREAT AT THE YOU AND

02:07:12.658 --> 02:07:14.827
THE- OTHER MISTER SMITH YOU

02:07:14.893 --> 02:07:16.829
JUST YOURSELF- IN REGARDS TO

02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:18.397
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE- IS A-

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:19.999
RECOVERABLE. FURTHER

02:07:20.065 --> 02:07:21.800
DISCHARGERS AND WHY DO WE HAVE

02:07:21.867 --> 02:07:23.936
A BACKLOG. AND IS IT MORE THAN

02:07:24.003 --> 02:07:25.871
A YEAR OLD A BACKLOG ARE WE

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:29.475
GOING ALL THE WAY BACK. TO TWO

02:07:29.541 --> 02:07:30.042
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

02:07:30.109 --> 02:07:31.477
WITH WITH THE- I THINK ON THE

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:33.078
SITE YEAH I THINK IT DEPENDS ON

02:07:33.145 --> 02:07:35.114
THE SITE- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES A

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:36.315
BACKLOG BECAUSE THEY'RE THE

02:07:36.382 --> 02:07:39.018
MOST SORT FORTY ESTá AMONGST-

02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:40.986
THE CHALLENGES OR THE CLEANUP

02:07:41.053 --> 02:07:43.422
SITES THAT THERE ARE- AND YOU

02:07:43.489 --> 02:07:44.957
KNOW WE AND I'LL SAY THAT YES I

02:07:45.024 --> 02:07:46.859
WHILE IT'S- MOSTLY FULLY

02:07:46.925 --> 02:07:48.460
RECOVERABLE IN SOME CASES IT'S-

02:07:48.527 --> 02:07:49.595
IT'S NEEDING TO BE POP ROCK

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:51.230
REPORTS BUT ACTION AND- YOU

02:07:51.296 --> 02:07:52.231
KNOW IT TAKES A LITTLE LONGER

02:07:52.297 --> 02:07:53.632
TO. DECIDE BRING TO OUR

02:07:53.699 --> 02:07:55.000
POLLUTION WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:57.102
RECOVERY OF THE FUNDING- YOU

02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:59.171
KNOW THE AGAIN THE BACKLOG IS

02:07:59.238 --> 02:07:59.705
THERE BECAUSE YOU NEED THE

02:07:59.772 --> 02:08:03.242
ACTUAL BODIES. TO PROCESS THE

02:08:03.308 --> 02:08:04.910
PROJECTS YOU TO REVIEW THE

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:07.146
PLANS AND TO ACTUALLY GO AFTER

02:08:07.212 --> 02:08:08.547
AND ENSURE THAT THE RESPONSIBLE

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:10.215
PARTIES ARE ARE UNDERTAKING THE

02:08:10.282 --> 02:08:11.717
WORK AND THE PROJECT IS A

02:08:11.784 --> 02:08:13.118
VIABLE ONE BECAUSE IT'S ONE

02:08:13.185 --> 02:08:14.453
THAT'S IN THE PROGRAM. IT'S

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.221
BEING MONITORED WE'RE SEEING

02:08:16.288 --> 02:08:17.656
THE COST PER ROUTE YOU KNOW

02:08:17.723 --> 02:08:18.891
GETTING REIMBURSED ON THAT WERE

02:08:18.957 --> 02:08:20.926
BILLING- AND SO IT'S KIND OF

02:08:20.993 --> 02:08:22.461
THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:25.664
NEED FOR JUST THE CORE- IF YOU

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:26.899
WILL BODIES TO ACTUALLY

02:08:26.965 --> 02:08:29.234
PROCESS. THAT WORK THAT ALLOWS

02:08:29.301 --> 02:08:31.270
US TO RECOVER MORE IF YOU WILL-

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:33.405
SO THE BACKLOG IS SOMETHING

02:08:33.472 --> 02:08:34.440
ABOUT YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S

02:08:34.506 --> 02:08:36.742

BEEN DOING WHAT IS I GET UP. AT

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:41.580
THIS AT THIS POINT AN OPEN CASE

02:08:41.647 --> 02:08:43.382
LOAD OF FOUR THOUSAND- WHICH

IN AND USE OF SUBCONTRACTORS

02:08:50.222 --> 02:08:52.124
INITIALLY FOR THE SOIL TESTINGS

02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:58.997
