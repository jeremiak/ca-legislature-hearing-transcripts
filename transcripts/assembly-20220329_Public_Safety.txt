YOU HAVE- YOU WITNESSES WE HAVE WITNESSES BEGIN MISTER CHERUB FACED WITH ALL OF YOU THIS. SO FIRST I WANT TO START BY THINKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE FOR WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH US ON THIS BILL AND GETTING US TO. A GOOD PLACE- WHERE WE CAN MOVE IT FORWARD AND TO ADD A HAPPY TO TAKE THAT COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TODAY. CAME HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY TO A BILL THAT WOULD EQUALIZE PENALTIES ON THREE PROMINENT SYMBOLS OF TERROR THE NEWS THE **** SWASTIKA AND A BURNING CROSS. IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY OF BLACK DAHLE WAS FOUND HANGING FOR A POWER LINE IN SOUTH LAKE TAHOE WITH A NOOSE AROUND ITS NECK. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE MAN WALKED ACROSS THE TOWN OF FAIRFAX PLACING SWASTIKAS ON THE TELEPHONE POLES. IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE NINETEEN YEAR OLD AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN IN A ROW GRANDIER GRANDET NEAR SAN LUIS OBISPO. AWOKE TO SEE AN ELEVEN FOOT TALL CROSS OF LEASING IN AN ADJACENT LOT DIRECTED TOWARDS HER HOME. THIS ALL OCCURRED IN JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS THE SYMBOLS OF TERROR CONTINUE TO PLAGUE OUR COMMUNITIES. AND LET'S BE CLEAR THE INTENT OF THESE INCIDENTS IS OFTEN TO TERRORIZE THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE. F. CRIME STATISTICS REPORT THE HATE CRIME SURGE THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN TWELVE YEARS IN TWENTY TWENTY. WITH CRIMES MOTIVATED BY RACE ALMOST DOUBLING. STATISTICS SHOW THAT 56% OF ALL HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA ARE MOTIVATED BY ANTI BLACK SENTIMENT. RANG THE PANDEMIC HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS WERE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH FUEL BY CLAIMS OF BLAME FOR THE PANDEMIC. DESPITE CAMPAIGNS TO COMBAT THESE TRENDS SYMBOLS OF HATE CONTINUE TO APPEAR ALL OVER CALIFORNIA WITH THE GOAL OF TERRORIZING AND INTIMIDATING MINORITIES. ARE LAWS ON THE SYMBOLS OF TERROR HAVE BEEN PIECEMEAL TOGETHER THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND ARE WOEFULLY INCONSISTENT. FOR EXAMPLE ANYONE CAUGHT HANGING A NOOSE CAN ONLY BE CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF OFFENSES. ANYONE CAUGHT HOSTING A SWASTIKA UNDER CURRENT LAW CAN BE CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR ON THE FIRST OF. AND SUBSEQUENT OFFENSE CAN BE CHARGED AS A WOBBLER. HE'S THE LOCATIONS FOR WHICH THESE SYMBOLS MAY BE PLACED ALSO DIFFERS ACROSS THE CODE WHEN. EARNING CROSS MORE THAN A SWASTIKA AND A NOOSE LESS THAN A SWASTIKA WE ARE NEGATING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF PHYSICAL THREAT TO A TARGETED GROUP. WITH HATE CRIMES INCREASING ACROSS THE STATE IT'S CRITICAL TO RECOGNIZE THE POWER AND DESTRUCTIVENESS OF THE SYMBOLS. AND RESTRICT THEIR USE ACCORDINGLY AND CONSISTENTLY AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY TWO WILL EQUALIZE THE PENALTIES FOR ALL THREE OF THE STATE THESE TERROR SYMBOLS BY MAKING THEM OFF THE FIRST TIME WOBBLER THE BILL ALSO EQUALIZE THE LOCATIONS FOR WHICH THE SYMBOLS CAN BE CHARGED. WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS REGARDING CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXPANSION INCLUDING A PUBLIC LOCATIONS AND A POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT BUT I WANT TO SAY IT AS I'VE SAID IN THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE. CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS COMMUTE ON AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CALIFORNIANS IS CRITICAL TO ME AND WE WORKED HARD TO LIMIT THE LAW TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS RIGHT TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT WHILE ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE LIMITATIONS PLACED ON THAT SPEECH BY THE COURTS. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS KIND OF CLOSE AYE DIRECTOR OF POLICY WITH THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE MARC LEVINE WITH THE NAME OPPOSING ABOLISHED OF MORAN AND THEY'RE BOTH ON THE PHONE.

FINALLY WE ACTUALLY ARE THE TO REMOVE THE INCREASING PENALTIES PROVIDED IN THE BILL IT'S BEEN PROVEN IN NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT INCREASE PENALTIES ARE NOT EFFECTIVE DETERRENT TO CRIME WE WOULD ASK THAT THE GOAL THE PENALTY ALIGNMENT THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT RAISING THE PENALTIES IN THE BILL. AGAIN LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ENGAGING ON THE ISSUE BUT YOU DOCTOR ON THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL WE MUST RESPECT THE ACTING OF A AT THIS. TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU MCGEORGE. GOOD MORNING GRANDDAUGHTER OF SURVIVORS OF ANTI SEMITIC VIOLENCE MY GRANDPARENTS FLED RUSSIA TWO WEEKS GAVE THE ORGANIZED MASSACRES KNOWN AS PROGRAMS THAT THE SAR LAUNCHED AGAINST JEWS MY FATHER CHANGED HIS NAME FROM GOLDSTINE TO GEORGE WHEN HE WENT SOUTH TO ORGANIZED LABOR UNIONS TO AVOID GETTING KILLED. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT THAT WAS EXPRESSED BY THE SUPPORTERS LETTER THAT THE RISE IN WHITE SUPREMACY AND EXTREMISM IS CONNECTED TO INCREASES IN ANTI DEMOCRATIC BEHAVIOR IN OUR STATE AND REFLECTED IN THE INCREASED APPEARANCE OF THE SYMBOLS. I AGREE WITH THE ACLU AND WOULD ECHO THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF A KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENT ABOUT THE- IT'S NOT JUST THE SYMBOL EMBLEM OR OTHER PHYSICAL IMPRESSION IS OUTLAWED BY THIS PROPOSED STATUTE. AND MY LETTER- I TALKED ABOUT THAT Q. ANON MEMBERS MIGHT BE TERRORIZED BY LBGTQ MEMBER PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH THE K. FLAG BECAUSE THEY WOULD SEE THAT AS A SYMBOL OF PEDOPHILE YOU. IN GENERAL I ALSO AGREE WITH WHAT THE A SO YOU SAID ABOUT THE HARMS OF CREATING NEW WALL BLURS CENTER ONLY THREE OTHER STATES HAVE FELONY STATUES WERE SWASTIKAS. NEW YORK VIRGINIA AND WASHINGTON. AND EACH ONE OF THOSE STATES SAYS IT IS EITHER FOR A DAMAGING INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY. ARE DRAWING IT OR PUTTING IT ON THE PREMISES THAT ARE USED PRIMARILY FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES OUR ON SOMEONE'S PROPERTY. THEY'RE NOT JUST APPLIED TO PUBLIC PLACES. THIS WILL NOT TOUCH STEM THE TIDE OF WHITE SUPREMACY AND EXTREMISM OR ACTUALLY MAKE THE COMMUNITY SAFER THIS IS A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING NOW IS YOU KNOW PHOBIA AND WHITE EXTREMISM AND AS A DONE A FIGHT BY THE DURBAN SOUTH AFRICA DECLARATION AND PROGRAMME OF ACTION. AND WE APPLAUD NO- MO HAN. THE YOUNG RAPPER IN FAIRFAX WHO TOLD THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD KID WHO WAS POSTING THIS HUASTEC GOES. ON STICKERS TO TAKE HIS FLYERS AND GET OUT OF TOWN. NO WHAT DID HIS PART.

I JUST WANT THINK THE OFFERING THIS BILL FORWARD AND THE OPPOSITION FOR SPEAKING SO ELOQUENTLY I KNOW THE AUTHOR'S INTENTION- BEHIND THIS BILL AND I TRUST THAT THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS HAVE BEEN WELL FOUNDED IN WELL HEARD AND I TRUST THAT THE AUTHOR WILL WORK ON THIS GOING FORWARD AND SO. I'LL BE VOTING IS TODAY. YES RESPOND TO. APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR- WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU WERE CONSIDERING CARRYING IT AND- I RECOGNIZE THE ULTIMATE INTENT WAS TO INSURE- IN YOUR VIEW THAT WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT EQUITY INTO THE WAY THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY- MEETING OUT. CONSEQUENCES FOR HATE- THE REALITY WAS THAT PRIOR TO THIS LEGISLATION. AT THE DISPLAYING OF A NOOSE WAS TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THAN IT WAS B. WHAT IS A FOR- DISPLAYS OF THAT. REALLY JUST A SYMBOL- AT RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS OR OR SWASTIKAS AND- AND IT'S SUCH A PROFOUND. EXAMPLE OF THE WAY IN WHICH- THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY AND THE LEGACY OF THE TREATMENT OF. OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY STILL TO THIS DAY AND TO BEING SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT WE ADDRESS IT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. AT THE COMMONSENSE DID THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION SO I'LL BE VOTING YES AS WELL. IN THE OTHER. YOU MAY CLOSE- I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND RESPOND TAX FOR HER AND- HER EXPLAINING REALLY WHEN I CAME TO HER WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS WHEN WE DISCOVERED THIS IN THE CODE- IT WAS JARRING TO ME AND YET ALSO NOT SURPRISING. THAT WE FIND THESE VESTIGES OF AN WHAT HAS BEEN A LONG HISTORY OF RACISM IN OUR CODE AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO FIX THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO TODAY- I ABSOLUTELY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION SOME OF WHAT WAS MENTIONED I'M IS CURRENT CODE. SO WORKING THROUGH THE ISSUES AROUND WHAT IS VAGUE IN THE CURRENT CODE BUT WE WANTED TO BE CLEAR AS WE MENTIONED WE WERE VERY CLEAR. I WAS VERY CLEAR TO ENSURE THAT IT FOLLOWS THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW REQUIRES AN INTENT TO TERRORIZE BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT WALKING DOWN THE STREET SHOWING YOUR PRIDE FOR A GAY PRIDE FLAG WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT INTENDED TO TERRORIZE ANYBODY AT ANY MOMENTS BUT INSTEAD SHOW YOUR IMPROPER. BILL IS LIMITED TO THOSE THAT GOING OUT AND USING THE SYMBOLS TO TERRORIZE COMMUNITIES. AND CREATE FEAR. AND COMMIT CRIMES AND AGAIN IT IS ALREADY CRIMINAL IN OUR CODE WE ARE DRESSED. AB MEETING IT OUT TO JUSTLY AND EQUALLY AS IT SHOULD BE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BET. YOU THINK YEAH AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL WORK. AS YOU WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE- TO MAKING CHANGES SO THAT- IT COMPORTS WITH. OBVIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AND- AND ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. BY BY BOTH A- OPPOSITION. AND- AND JUST IN GENERAL I KNOW- THE REASON THE CLAN IS IT AS POWERFUL AS BECAUSE LAWSUIT. RECENTLY ALMOST BANKRUPTED AND HOBBLED AND SO FINANCIAL PENALTIES ON ORGANIZATIONS FROM THAT STANDPOINT CAN BE CRIPPLING SO- THIS IS IN SOME WAYS A LITTLE BIT OF AN EXPERIMENT SO- I THINK THE COMMITTEES WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DO ADDRESS. THE WHAT THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP THE CHAIRS RECOMMEND AND I. THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED ON AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY TWO BY SOME MEMBER OF OUR K. HAVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER I LACKEY. LACKEY I BONTA. BONTA HI BRIAN. BRIAN I WORK HARD WORK I SANTIAGO. SEYARTO THEY ARE TOO HIGH. THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYONE. BYE DON'T SEE MISTER FLOOR BY DO SEEM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAGUE. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE. I DON'T KNOW BEFORE- JURY INSTRUCTION LESSER RELATED OFFENSES. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN GOOD MORNING SHARON MEMBERS- I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWO FOUR THREE FIVE THIS BILL RESTORES A SOUND LEGAL PRACTICE THAT WAS IN PLACE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT IN CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL COURTS WHEN X. KEY ACCUSED PERSON IS CHARGED WITH A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT CHARGES FILED THAT REFLECT ALL EVIDENCE OF THE CASE THAT WAS THE CASE IN CALIFORNIA FOR FOURTEEN YEARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR CALIFORNIA APPELLATE COURT RULED THAT A DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL CASE WAS ENTITLED TO ALSO PRESENT THE JURY WITH A LESSER. RELATED EFFECTS CRIMES THAT MAY NOT SHARE ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE FACTS OF THE CASE THEN IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE SO CALLED TOUGH ON CRIME ERA A CALIFORNIA APPELLATE COURT OVERTURNED THIS RULING PEOPLE THE BERKS THE BERKS COURT CONCLUDED THAT CRIMINAL DEFENDANTSARE NOT ENTITLED TO A JURY INSTRUCTION ON WESTERLY DEFENSES AND ALAS THE LEGISLATURE MAKES THE CHANGE. AS A RESULT FOR THE PAST TWENTY FOUR YEARS DEFENDANTS IN A CRIMINAL CASES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ARGUE FOR CONVICTION OF LESSER OFFENSES CURRENTLY A DISTRICT ATTORNEY MAY FILE CHARGES AGAINST A DEFENDANT THAT INCLUDE A PRIMARY LEDGER FENCE AND A LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE BUT DEFENDANTS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ASK FOR JURY INSTRUCTIONS THAT SUPPORT AYE LESSER RELATED OFFENSE ONE THAT IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE CHARGED OFFENSE THAT HAS CREDIBLE FACTUAL BASIS A LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES ONE THAT OVERLAPS OR SHARES LEGAL ELEMENTS WITH THE CHARGED OFFENSE. THAT IS YOU CANNOT COMMIT THE PRIMARY FENCE WITHOUT COMMITTING THE LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE THE CURRENT PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL COURTS PREVENTS A DEFENDANT FROM SUBMITTING EVIDENCE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE JURY TO CONSIDER LESSER RELATED OFFENSE WHICH DENIES DEFENDANTS CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS AND A FAIR TRIAL. RESTORING THIS PRACTICE IS NOT ABOUT AVOIDING JUSTICE IS A PROVIDING MORE CONVICTION OPTIONS TO A JURY WHEN THEY ARE SUPPORTED. BY CREDIBLE EVIDENCE SOME CUTS TO BASED FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS IN OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. BY PERMITTING DEFENDANTS PRESENT TO THE JURY A LESSER RELATED OFFENSE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE PRIMARY UNDERLYING CHARGES. I WOULD THAT I LIKE SO LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY TO IN THIS IS IN SUPPORT BRIAN GARLITS FROM C. A. C. G. C. A. C. J. AND NEXT DOOR- TEN FROM THE L. A. COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER WILL BE ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE BILL. YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BRIAN GORDON I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF C. A. C. J. THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS BRONER FOR THIS BILL THE BOSTON GRATEFUL AUTISM MEMBER WE ROBBERY. CORRECT CRIMINAL LAW FOR THE PAST FOUR SEVEN YEARS AND I'M SURE BY THE CAL. STATE PARKS FROM THE LOS ANGELES. IN ADDITION TO FILLING CASES JUDGE. OF ALSO ARE DOES OF INCLUDING SUPREME. YEAH I THE IMPACT OF OUR STAY LAW UNLESS YOU'RE OFFENSES. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE BOTH PROSECUTORS DEFENSE LAWYER. I WAS ADEPT D. A. R. K. FOR THE FOR HALF MY CAREER. IN A BEEN A PRIVATE FOR THE HALF. WHEN I WAS A D. I TRAINED CROSS. STAY ISSUES- ON THE ISSUE OF JURIES. AND LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES SPECIFICALLY. RESTORING THE RIGHT TO LEFT RELATED OFFENSES WHEN THE EVIDENCE WARRANTS IT WOULD IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF JURY VERDICTS. IT WOULD LESSEN THE NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS WERE CONVICTED OF CRIMES THAT ARE MORE SERIOUS THAN THE OFFENSE THEY TRULY COMMITTED. AND IT WOULD LESSEN THE NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS TO AVOID CRIMINAL LIABILITY ENTIRELY BECAUSE THE JURY THAT ACQUITTED THEM A BECAUSE OF A JURY THAT ACQUITTED THEM OF THE CRIME THAT WAS CHARGED HAD NO ABILITY TO CONVICT THEM OF A LESSER OFFENSE THAT WAS APPROVED. I SUSPECT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF OUR STATE CITIZENS ACROSS THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM WOULD WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE INSTRUCTED ON LESSER RELATED OFFENSES AND HAVE THE POWER. TO CONVICT A DEFENDANT ON SUCH AN OFFENSE IF THE EVIDENCE WARRANTS AT. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM ALLOWS LESSER RELATED OFFENSE INSTRUCTIONS BASED SOLELY. ON THE PROSECUTOR'S TACTICAL DECISION AND INMY EXPERIENCE IT IS EXTREMELY RARE FOR PROSECUTORS TO CONSENT TO IT CALIFORNIA LAW SHOULD BE RESTORED TO WHAT IT WAS FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THROUGH NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT ONE FINAL COMMENT IF I MAY BEFORE I CLOSE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW NOT ONLY ARE JURORS NOT GIVEN THE OPTION OF CONVICTING. ON A LESSER RELATED OFFENSE BUT THEY AREN'T EVEN INSTRUCTED ON THE DEFINITION OF SUCH CRIMES. SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE. A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A MENTALLY ILL DEFENDANT WHO'S ARRESTED INSIDE. A BUSINESS AT NIGHT- AND THERE'S A REAL ISSUE ON WHETHER SHE HAD THE INTENT TO STEAL OR IS GUILTY OF ONLY A TRESS PASSIN THE NEXT WITNESS WILL TALK ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE. NOT ONLY IS THE JURY IN THAT CASE UNABLE. TO CONVICT ON TRUST PASTOR NOT GIVEN THAT OPTION BUT THE DEFINITION OF TRESPASS ISN'T EVEN GIVEN TO THE JURY. THIS ELIMINATES DEFENSE COUNSEL'S OPPORTUNITY IN CLOSING ARGUMENT TO EXPLAIN AND IT WOULD BE A POWERFUL EXPLANATION WHY THE EVIDENCE PROVES THE ELEMENTS OF TRESPASS. CLEARLY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. AND THEN COMPARE AND CONTRAST THAT. TO THE- OVERWHELMING. THAT COMPARE AND CONTRAST OVERWHELMING PROOF ON THE TRESPASS. TO WHAT'S LACKING ON THE BURGLARY AND SHOW WHY THAT CLIENT SHOULD BE ACQUITTED OF BURGLARY. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE- RETURNED TO POWER IN JURY TRIALS TO EXACTLY WHERE IT SHOULD BE NON PROFESSIONAL JURORS THAT OUR CONSTITUTION ENTRUSTS TO BE THE SOLE FACT FINDERS IN CRIMINAL TRIALS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. IN ORDER BY PHONE. NICK STEWART OATEN PROCESSES COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER. NICK IS HAVE TECHNICAL ISSUES A PHONE SO MARKET WAS GONNA SOAK OKAY RECENTLY THANK YOU THIS. GOOD TO HAVE A DESIGNATED HITTER AND AROUND. I AM AT- SO I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF NICK STEWART OATEN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IS ONE OF THE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. AND IF NICK WERE ABLE TO TESTIFY IS HAVING TECHNICAL ISSUES- I'M JUST GONNA READ HIS TESTIMONY HE HAS BEEN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS ANY SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS THAT PROSECUTORS CAN UNILATERALLY PREVENT JURIES FROM DECIDING WHETHER THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OF AN OFFENCE OTHER THAN THAT CHARGED BY THE PROSECUTOR. EVEN WHEN THE EVIDENCE ESTABLISHES THAT THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED ONLY THAT LESSER OFFENSE. A PROSECUTOR MAY FOR EXAMPLE CHARGING MENTALLY ILL DEFENDANTS WHO WANDERED INTO SOMEONE'S HOUSE WITH BURGLARY. BUT REFUSED TO ALLOW THE JURY TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE ONLY GUILTY OF TRESPASSING. NICK HAD THIS EXACT ISSUE WITH THE SIXTY YEAR OLD WOMAN WAS SCHIZOPHRENIC TWO HOUR MENTAL HEALTH HOLD FIFTY ONE FIFTY BECAUSE SHE BEEN WANDERING INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND TAKING NAPS WHEN SHE WAS RELEASED FROM THE WHOLE SHE WANDERED DOWN THE STREET AND ENTERED ANOTHER HOUSE. WHERE SHE PROMPTLY TOOK ANOTHER NAP THE PROSECUTOR CHARGED WITH RESIDENTIAL BURGLARY A FELONY STRIKE OFFENSE THAT CARRIES A SENTENCE OF SIX YEARS IN STATE PRISON BECAUSE UNDER CURRENT LAW A JURY IS PERMITTED ONLY TO DECIDE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OF THE OFFENSES APPROVED BY THE PROSECUTOR THE PROSECUTOR'S REFUSAL TO CHARGE TRESPASSING MEANT THAT THE JURY WAS NOT EVEN PERMITTED TO CONSIDER THAT CHARGE. WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM JURORS ARE THEREFORE LEFT IN AN ALL OR NOTHING SITUATION FORCED TO DECIDE BETWEEN RELEASING A PERSON WHO HAS CLEARLY DONE SOMETHING WRONG OR CONVICTING THEM OF AN OFFENSE THAT'S NOT AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. PROSECUTORS CAN THEREFORE OVER CHARGES DEFENDANT WITH AN OFFENSE MORE SERIOUS THAN MAP WARRANTED BY THE EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO COURSE A PLEA. CONFIDENT THAT A JURY WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER A LESS SERIOUS OFFENSE IS APPROPRIATE. BY ENSURE THAT JURORS NOT PROSECUTORS OR DEFENSE ATTORNEYS GET TO DECIDE WHAT OFFENSIVE FINNEY IS ESTABLISHED BY THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE THIS MIL BILL PROMOTES THE FAIRNESS AND A RETURN TO JURY AND POWER MET THAT HAS BEEN LACKING FOR THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN AND OUT ALL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY DIMARTINO ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU.

GOOD MORNING CHEERING COMMITTEE THIS IS GREGORY SET OUT ON BEHALF OF INITIATE JUSTICE STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND LINE FIFTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. REPUBLICAN REP AT THE JESSICA AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. NOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SOON. NINE IN THE ROOM- DIM WILL AGAIN- EARLY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. KAMOGAWA TO THE FIVE YES OF. I'M SORRY ROBERT MASS MAN ON THE PHONE OR THE PHONE GO AHEAD I DO WE HAVE TO. I AM NOT ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN ORANGE COUNTY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION- I PREVIOUSLY WORKED WITH SUPPORT WITH THIS BRIAN GIRL WITSEN I REMEMBER HIM ARGUING AGAINST LESS RELATED OFFENSES BUT I GUESS TIMES HAVE CHANGED- AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE WE TAKE CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL COURTS BACK DECADES TO AN OUTDATED AND UNWORKABLE RULE. REQUIRING COURTS TO INSTRUCT JURIES ON LESSER RELATED OFFENSES. OUR SUPREME COURT STATED CALIFORNIA LAWS LONG PROVIDED THAT EVEN ABSENT A REQUEST AND OVER ANY PARTIES OBJECTION TRIAL COURTS MUST INSTRUCT ON LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES THESE ARE LESSER OFFENSES NECESSARILY INCLUDED IN SPARKS OFFENSES THIS RULES FAIR TO BOTH SIDES AND AFFORDS EQUAL PROTECTION TO ALL PARTIES. LESSER RELATED OFFENSES ARE DIFFERENT THESE ARE LESSER OFFENSES THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDED IN THE CHARGED OFFENSE. BUT ONLY BEAR SOME CONCEPTUAL OR EVIDENTIARY RELATIONSHIP TO CHARGE DEFENSE INCLUDE THE ACCUSATORY PLEADING GIVES NO NOTICE TO SUCH NON INCLUDED OFFENSES. HI THIS BILL WILL TAKE US BACK TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. IN AT THE TIME OF THE ROSE- JUSTICE ROSE BIRD ERA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OUR SUPREME COURT SPECIFICALLY RULED THAT COURTS SHOULD NOT REPEAT NOT INSTRUCT ON LESSER RELATED OFFENSES AND THIS IS BEEN THE LAW OF THE LAND CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. PROBABLY THE BEST ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS BILL. IS FROM THE SUPREME COURT'S OWN WORDS IN THE OPINION OF BERKS FROM NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE SUPREME COURT SAID THE RATIONALE FOR LESSER RELATED OFFENSES HAS SINCE BEEN EXPRESSLY REPUDIATED. FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND CONTINUES TO FIND LITTLE SUPPORT IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS THE OLD RULE CAN BE UNFAIR TO THE PROSECUTION AND ACTUALLY PROMOTE INACCURATE FACT FINDING BECAUSE IT GIVES THE DEFENDANT A SUPERIOR TRIAL RIGHT TO SEEK AND OBTAIN CONVICTION FOR A LESSER- CHARGE DEFENSE.

THIS I KNOW IT'S THERE MAY A COMFORTABLE FOR REASON- GET MORE AND THANK YOU MISTER. OF A COMMITTEE TODAY I PRESENT MY BILL AB NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL CRISIS THAT IS GOING TO LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AGES AND WALKS OF LIFE AND IMPACT OUR NATIONAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING. BEFORE THE COVER NINETEEN CONDEMNING IMPOSED LOCKDOWNS FENNO USE OR CONSUMPTION AMONG CALIFORNIANS WAS ALREADY APPROACHING ALARMING RATES. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR DID FOR DRUG ABUSE THE CYSTIC. VANNO WAS RESPONSIBLE OVER FORTY TWO THOUSAND OVERDOSE DEATHS. IN THE NECK IN THE TWELVE MONTHS LEADING UP TO MARCH I'M MAY TWENTY TWENTY. SINCE THEN NATION WHY DEBTS FOR FENNO SKYROCK. SKYROCKETED WHAT COUNTS RANGING FROM TEN TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DATAS FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. HAS SADLY SHOWN THAT SINCE TWENTY TWENTY FENNEL HAS BEEN THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN ADULTS EIGHTEEN TO FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD. THE LONELINESS AND ISOLATION OF THE PANDEMIC CREATED A PERFECT STORM FOR ADDICTIONS AND NEW USERS TO GET ACCESS TO READILY AVAILABLE COUNTERFEIT PHARMACEUTICALS. AND OTHER FEDERAL LACED DRUGS. THE RISING DOES OFFEND OF THESE MANY PEOPLE IF OF THE VICTIMS ASKING SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. HOW SHOULD WE KNOW THAT WE AS A SOCIETY SOCIETY WOULD NOT TOLERATE ONE MORE PERSON BEEN SOLD A CONSUMING FENNEL AND DYING IN THE STATE. HOW DO WE SEND THE MESSAGE THAT AS PARENTS AS FRIENDS AS NEIGHBORS AS LEADERS THEY WERE NO LONGER STAND BY. AS THIS CRISIS PROCESS PUNISHMENT THE FOR THE POSSESSION OF FENTANYL WITH INTENT TO SELL WITH THE SAME PUNISHMENT FOR COCAINE AND HEROIN POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO SELL. EARLY IF SOMEONE IS IN POSSESSION ONE KILOGRAM OF COCAINE OR HEROIN THE MINIMUM THEY CAN RECEIVE HIS ADDITIONAL THREE YEAR TERM ON THEIR PRISON SENTENCES. IF SOMEONE IS FOUND IN POSSESSION OF EIGHTY KILOGRAMS OR MORE WITH INTENT TO SELL THEY CAN RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THIS BILL DOES NOT TARGET VICTIMS IT WOULD NOT TARGET VICTIMS WHO SHOULD SEEK EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT IF THEY ARE SUSPECTED IT AND EXPERIENCING FEDERAL RELATED OVERDOSE. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO GO DIRECTLY AFTER JUST THE DEALERS. WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OF FEDERAL. WITH THE INTENT TO SELL WITHOUT FEAR OF CONSEQUENCES WE ARE FACING A DANGEROUS SITUATION THERE WILL CONTINUE TO SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL AND HE WOULD TAKE A SERIOUS STAND AGAINST FEDERAL IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR STATE. WE'RE HERE. WHAT HERE- TODAY- BY PHONE- TO TESTIFY IS CAPTAIN BURKE. BART STARR DARNELL OF THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. CAPTAIN BY NOW THE EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR COULD YOU LET THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN. GET MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT YES WE CAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE INSUPPORTABLE AB NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE YEAH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE DRUG EPIDEMIC THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY CRISIS OF OUR TIME. FOR THE FIRST TIME THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD NATIONWIDE DRUG RELATED DEATHS EXCEEDED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. BETWEEN APRIL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY IT WILL BE ABOUT TWENTY ONE A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED. THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIX AMERICANS LOST THEIR LIVES TO A DRUG RELATED DEATHS. THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THAT NUMBER IS SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS LIKE FENTANYL PERSPECTIVE THIS IS EQUAL TO TEN THE BOEING SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN AIRLINE JETS CRASHING EACH WEEK FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR STRAIGHT. IF THAT NEARLY CRASHES OCCURRED WE WOULD DO SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY TO FIX THE PROBLEM. AB NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT IN PLACE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS. THE BILL ADDRESSES THOSE ARE TRAFFICKING ALL NOT THOSE SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION. BY PLACING FEDERAL PROBABLY IN THE PENAL CODE THE BILL RECOGNIZES THE POTENCY OF THIS DEADLY SUBSTANCE. I WOULD ADVISE YOU THAT THIS IS A DEADLY SUBSTANCE THAT CLAIMS MORE MORE LIVES EACH DAY. IN ORANGE COUNTY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FEDERAL DEATHS WAS THIRTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE OUR TOTAL FEDERAL DEBT WAS SIX HUNDRED NINETY THREE. WITH SIXTY TWO CASES STILL PENDING. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH STATEWIDE BUT NO DEATHS INCREASED OVER IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF FEDERAL RELATED DEATHS WAS TWO HUNDRED ONE. FIVE YEARS LATER THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STATEWIDE DAMAGE THE. FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX. THANK YOU TO HELP. THE BILL. IT IS INCREASE IT ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE ALSO NEED TO EDUCATION CIRCLE RIGHT TO SPEAK THIS IS RIDICULOUS. IT THE BOOK OF OUR EFFORTS IN ORANGE COUNTY ABOVE THE INFLUENCE DRUG EDUCATION PROGRAM WAS UNVEILED THIS YEAR FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS IT CONTEMPORARY IMPACTFUL AND WE BELIEVE IT'LL BECOME A MODEL FOR OTHERS. TREATMENT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF WHAT WE DO AS WELL. R. O. R. ORANGE COUNTY CARE PROGRAM OF INTEGRATED SERVICES AND THAT ARE JAIL ARE WORKING TO HELP ADDICTS MAINTAIN SOBRIETY. BUT WHILE WE WORK TO REDUCE THE BANTER EDUCATION TREATMENT WE ALSO WE MUST ATTACK THE SUPPLY. THIS IS THAT YOUR MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS. BUT NO AS FAR AS OUR COMMUNITY. IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS INTO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF MCCARTY KING SEES OVER TWO HUNDRED FIVE POUNDS. FEDERAL AND. ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN PILLS SUSPECTED TO CONTAIN SOME LEVEL OF FOOTBALL. AS ONE WITH OVER TWENTY TWO YEARS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE EXPERIENCE I KNOW THE LAW WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE ONLY FOR THE BAD BEHAVIOR. AB NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE PROVIDE THAT CAUGHT BUT BY CORRECTED DESPAIRED IN THE LAW THAT STREET THE TRAFFIC IT BUT NO AS A LESSER OFFENSE THE TRACKING DRUGS LIKE COCAINE AND HEROIN. THIS FALL THE LAW CREATE INCENTIVE FOR TRAFFICKING ABOUT MORE DEADLY SUBSTANCE. IT IS BURNING CONSEQUENCE FOR HURLING A CONSEQUENCE FOR IT BUT NO MAKES THIS CLEAR. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE DEATHS INCREASED 27% OFF BUT NO DEATHS INCREASED 41002% THE LACK OF CONSEQUENCE ALONG WITH THAT OF MANUFACTURING THIS DROUGHT CLEARLY INCENTIVIZE THE TRAFFICKING OF ITS MORE POTENT SUBSTANCE. FORGET YOUR APARTMENT AFTER YOU SUPPORT IS NEEDED SOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU CAPTAIN IN THE ROOM. SENAD WOULD NOW GO TO THE PHONE PHONE LINES EIGHTEEN T. OPERATORS SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE I DON'T NUMBER SEVEN SIX. THANK YOU AN APPEARANCE SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS THE ONE THEN. ZERO AND AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO ONE QUEUING UP OPPOSITION. THE MORNING CHAIR NUMBERS ONLY SEE LEWIS ON BEHALF THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE HERE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE AND DOING RECOGNIZED I THINK THE AUTHOR STUFF FOR TALKING WITH ME ON SHORT NOTICE- BUT DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT IS ADVOCATING FOR DRUG POLICY IS GROUNDED IN SCIENCE COMPASSION HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACT THAT DRUG USE IS HAVING ON THE LIVES OF USERS. THEIR FAMILIES AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WHO'VE LOST A LOVED ONE TO OVERDOSE SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER OF FATAL DRUG OVERDOSES HAS RISEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY AT LEAST NINE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE DIED FROM DRUG RELATED OVERDOSES WE KNOW THIS IMPACT ISRAEL AND IT'S IMPACTING COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. AND THAT IS WHY DPA STANDS FIRM AND URGING THE STATE TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE APPROACH WITH LIFESAVING HARM REDUCTION SERVICES THAT ARE PROVEN TO SAVE LIVES BY DIRECTLY REACHING PEOPLE AT HIGHEST RISK FOR OVERDOSE AND EVIDENCE BASED LOW BARRIER TREATMENT AND ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT CRIMINAL PENALTIES SUCH AS THOSE IN THIS BILL WILL NOT REDUCE THE ABILITY AVAILABILITY THE OR THE USE OF THE FENNEL NOR PREVENT OVERDOSES RELATED SUBSTANCES ECHOES THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS POLICIES THAT WERE ENACTED THROUGH THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. THAT WERE AROUND CRACK COCAINE THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED PEOPLE OF COLOR CROWDED PRISONS AND COST LIVES. THE US SENTENCING COMMISSION IN TWENTY NINETEEN FOUND THAT NEARLY 70% OF THOSE THAT WERE SENTENCE OR FENTANYL ANALOGUES WERE BLACK OR LATINO. THE PRIMARY RISK OF OVERDOSE OF FENTANYL RESULTS FROM ITS UNKNOWING INGESTION THE PROCESS OF ADDING FINAL TO HEROIN IS USUALLY DONE EARLY IN THE PRODUCTON PROCESS AND ACCORDING TO THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION. BUT NO IS GENERALLY ADDED TO HEROIN BEFORE ENTERS THE U. S. THEREFORE LOW LEVEL SELLERS MAY NOT KNOW THEY ARE DISTRIBUTING. THIS BILL WOULD NOT REDUCE THE INCLUSION OF FENTANYL IN THE DRUG SUPPLY AS IT TAKES PLACE HIGHER UP IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULD DISCOURAGE EFFECTIVE USES OF DEALING WITH THE OPIOID HEALTH CRISIS. UNDERMINING CURRENT EFFORTS BY DRIVING PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS AWAY FROM HEALTH SERVICES AND ENCOURAGING RISKIER DRUG TAKING ACTIVITY IN ORDER TO AVOID DETECTION AND PROSECUTION. WELL YOU WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE INTENT IS NOT TO DISCOURAGE VICTIMS WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IT WOULD IMPACT CALIFORNIANS GOOD SAMARITAN LAW WHICH ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES. IN CASE OF AN OVERDOSE. THE THREAT OF POLICE INVOLVEMENT IN SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS MAY MAKE AN INDIVIDUAL HESITANT TO CALL- ANYTIME THAT SOMEONE IS IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION OR RUN FROM THE SCENE RATHER THAN HELP AFFECT THEM. HELLO VOTERS HAVE VOTED HAVE SIGNALED AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT THEIR PREFERENCE FOR USING A HEALTH APPROACH TO DRUG OFFENSES AND THEIR DESIRE TO UNWIND THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS. REVERSING COURSE AT THIS TIME AND GOING BACK TO OVER CRIMINALIZATION WILL NOT IN. A DRESSER INC- MARGINALIZATION OR ADDRESS THE STIGMA THAT OCCURS. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS IS A HEALTH CRISIS AND WE URGE HERE NO VOTE. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION. EARNING GOING BACK AS FOR THE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS A POST. THANK YOU. MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION A POST THANK. FRED WILLIAMS AND WE HAVE ACLU CAL ACTION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. AT&amp;T WILL NOW GO TO THE PHONE LINES ANYBODY ON. HOLD IT WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS. THIS BILL AB. NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR POST PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO. NO OPERATORS YOU HAVE WON WITH AN OPERATOR. WE HAVE WON WITH AN OPERATOR ONE MOMENT WE DO HAVE ONE OKAY WE DO HAVE ONE NOW. AND THAT'S LINE SIXTY SIX. R. ONE MOMENT. NINE SIXTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING THIS IS GREGORY FELL ON THE HAPPEN IS JUST ANDERSON OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THERE'S NO EITHER THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO- TALK TO THE AUTHOR. MACHAR YOU MAY THANK YOU SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING- THIS THIS BILL FORWARD- TRYING TO ADDRESS- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IS ESCALATING OUT OF CONTROL. IN CALIFORNIA AND EVERYWHERE ELSE- YOU KNOW ONE I THINK ONE OF THE RECURRING THEMES IS THAT- WILL. THAT THE- THANK CARCERI XIN ISN'T WORKING TO SLOW DOWN THE EPIDEMIC. IN ITS NOT IN AND SOMETIMES INCARCERATION ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT- AT BEING ABLE TO STOP THAT BECAUSE FOR EVERY- DRUG DEALER THAT WE GET OFF THE STREET SOMEBODY ELSE TAKES THEIR PLACE- BUT IT'S MORE OF. THAT THAT RIGHT THERE IT DOES COME A TIME BECAUSE- WHAT I'VE FAILED TO HERE IS WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE HAVE A DEALER THAT IS. KILLING PHILIP LITERALLY KILLING. A BUNCH OF PEOPLE- THEY KNOW WHAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THEY'RE GETTING OUT ANYBODY THAT'S DOING ANY DRUG OR SELLING ANY DRUGS. NOWADAYS IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THEY'RE GIVING THEIR FRIEND- WHAT THEY'RE GIVING- WHAT THEY'RE SELLING OUT THERE- ISN'T LACED- AB PSYCH 90% OF ITS LACED. AND THEY'LL KNOW IT- THE IDEA IS TO GET PEOPLE HOOKED. QUICKER ON AN OPIOID SO THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BUY. AND THAT'S CALLED CREATING YOUR OWN MARKET AND YOU KNOW THERE IS A PUNISHMENT PART OF THAT- TO OUR INCARCERATION SYSTEM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DESERVED IT THAT THAT THAT WIND UP GETTING REHABILITATED AND THEN THERE'S ALSO PEOPLE THAT GET PUNISHED. AND AND I THINK WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR BILL IS TRYING TO DO. IS JUST TREAT. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOW INVOLVED IN A NEWER DRUG FENTANYL THE SAME AS THE OTHER DRUGS THAT ARE- WE HAVE NOTORIOUSLYBUT NOT. AS MUCH- CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATHS OF SO MANY PEOPLE. WITH SO LITTLE RECOGNITION THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS GOING TO KILL THEM ONE PILL KILLS. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU IF YOU OVERDOSE ON FENTANYL YOU'VE GOT FORTY FIVE MINUTES. FOR SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO COME HELP YOU OTHERWISE YOU ARE DEAD. AND A LOT OF THOSE DEAD OR KIDS. AND SO WE NEED TO SEND THAT MESSAGE AND ONE OF THOSE MESSAGES IS WE WON'T TOLERATE. DRUG DEALERS WHO BY THE WAY MAKE MORE MONEY THAN WE DO. THEY HAVE BETTER HOUSES AND WE DO AND HAVE BETTER CARS AND WE DO. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ENTICE THEM WITH A JOB AT MCDONALD'S. TO GET OUT GET OUT OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING- WE NEED TO SEPARATE THEM FROM OUR KIDS AND ALL THOSE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING KILLED WITH FENNEL. SO I APPRECIATE YOU TACKLING THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPOSITION TO- BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE PEOPLE THERE ACTUALLY. OUT THERE DOING THE DAMAGE- BUT DEATH WE GOT TO KEEP TRYING SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU NAY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IS ONE A HIGHLIGHT- AS PART OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL FOR ME- I AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE HAVE A COMMITTEE MEMBER WHO TALKED ABOUT BEING DIRECTLY IMPACTED. BY THE EXISTENCE OF FENTON ALL AND WE IN OUR COMMUNITY ALL HAVE THAT- INCREDIBLY MOVED BY DATA. AND RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT TO DATE GENERALLY INDICATES THAT INCREASES IN THE CERTAINTY OF PUNISHMENT AS OPPOSED TO THE SEVERITY OF PUNISHMENT ARE MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE DETERRENT BENEFITS SO AS WE ARE SEEKING WAYS TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT. AT THE EXISTENCE OF FENDER VENTS ON THE USE OF FRENCH IN ALL. IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT ENHANCEMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE PATHWAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE VOTING ON THIS BILL. BURKE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT APPROACH TO THE DRUGS HAS OBVIOUSLY FAILED I PREFERRED THE APPROACH IN PORTUGAL WHERE DRUG USE IS DECRIMINALIZED THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THINGS LIKE SAFE DRUG USE SPACES WHERE YOU COULD TEST FOR FAT KNOWLEDGE ETCETERA. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AS LONG AS WE MAKE DRUG POSSESSION ILLEGAL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. JUST WHEN YOU A CLOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- LET ME JUST BE CLEAR ONCE AGAIN AB ONE NINE FIVE FIVE IS NOT GIVING ENHANCEMENT TO THOSE WHO PROCESSES. BUT NOW IT'S FOR THE THOSE WHO PROCESS THAT NOW WITH THE INTENT TO SELL. WE'RE GOING AFTER THE DEALERS NOT THE VICTIMS I KNOW THAT A LOT OF COMMENTS HERE HAS BEEN MADE STATING THAT YOU KNOW- WE NEED COMPASSION ABSOLUTELY. THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO AND WHO AND SEVEN POSSESSION OF THESE AND BUYS THEM DOES NOT KNOW ONE PILL WHAT WILL KILL. IT ONLY TAKES ONE PILL FENTANYL TO KILL WITHIN MINUTES. SO THIS IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VICTIMS THOSE WHO PROCESS THAT NO THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE DRUG DEALERS WERE MAKING FAT NO. ADDING THAT INTO THE SAME CATEGORY AS HEROIN AND COCAINE. BETWEEN THE YEARS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY STATE WIFE FENTANYL RELATED DEATHS INCREASED OVER NINE DEATHS 230-008-0050. SEVEN. ABSOLUTELY I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE WE NEED MORE PUBLIC HEALTH WE NEED MORE AWARENESS WE MEET WE NEED MORE CAMPAIGNING TO TELL THESE INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION DOES THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN TO FORTY FIVE. THE DANGER OF THESE FAT NOW THE DANGER OF TAKING THESE THIS ONE PILL. ONE PILL. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT GOING TO FIT THE FULL DEPEND THAT MAKE EPIDEMIC PROBLEM OF THIS CRISIS. WE NEED TO START SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS IN MY OPINION AND I'M THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE. WHO'VE BEEN DOORS AND SUPPORT THIS BILL. WE NEED TO GO AFTER THE DEALERS GET THEM OFF THE STREETS THE LAST THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO SELL THESE DRUGS FENNEL. THE BETTER IS EAT LESS ACCESS FOR OUR CHILDREN OR YOUNG ADULTS TO GET HAND. TO GET A HAND ON ONE PILL. AGAIN THE BILL ACCOUNTABLE. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE STAND BY THE FAMILIES AND THE VICTIMS. WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE ONE PILL WILL KILL. I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME TODAY AND HELP ME TAKE A STAND AND MAKE THE THEY PUT THESE DRUG DEALERS THANK YOU AND I'M OF THE BILL. A SECOND. THANK GUESTS WILL CALL FOR THE QUESTION PLACE. AB NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE BANKS A MEMBER WHEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY LACKEY HI BONTA. BONTA KNOW BRIAN BRIAN NO QUIRK QUIRK KNOWS SANTIAGO SAN DIEGO KNOWS THEY ARE TO YES THEY ARE TO I THAT MISSION. THE CLOSURE FAILS. EXPIRATION YEAH. BOB GIPSON. BUT I AM NOT A MISSED YOUR GROUND THANK YOU. FIVE WELL. SHE IT'S NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. AB. TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FOUR. GOOD MORNING. MR TURN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO SEVEN FOUR IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE TEAR HERE TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE IN BY COMMITTING TO TAKING A PROPOSED AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE FOR YOUR STATUE OF LIMITATIONS TO ONLY CASES OF SEVERE NEGLECT. MEMBERS UNDER CURRENT LAW. MANDATED REPORTERS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT KNOWN OR SUSPECTED CHILD. ABUSE AND NEGLECT SO THAT INVESTIGATION CAN TAKE PLACE. HOWEVER IF A MANDATED REPORTER FAILS TO PROTECT A CHILD BY FAILING TO REPORT. AND WHEN YOUR PASSES THE LAW IS NO LONGER ENFORCEABLE. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS- WITH THIS APPROACH IS THAT SEVERAL CASES HAVE OCCURRED WHERE A CHILD HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF PHYSICAL ABUSE OR NEGLECT. AND A MANDATED REPORTER WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS AND DID NOT REPORT THIS ABUSE TO AUTHORITIES. THIS LAPSE IN TIME AND SOMETIMES MONTHS OR YEARS CREATES A VERY DIFFICULT PROSECUTION OF THE PERPETRATORS. DUE TO LOST EVIDENCE AND EXPOSES THE VULNERABLE CHILD TO AN EGREGIOUS SITUATION OF A BECOMING AN ONGOING VICTIM. OF PREVENTABLE IN THE MEAT. REITERATE THAT OF PREVENTABLE PHYSICAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FOUR DOES NOT INCREASE THE PENALTY OF THE FAILURE TO REPORT. CRIME THE BILL MERELY EXTENDS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS TO ENSURE MANDATED REPORTERS TAKE THIS LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY. MANDATED REPORTERS ARE AWARE OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS BY BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE TO NO ENFORCEMENT MANY ORGANIZATIONS DEVELOP A SENSE. THAT THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES OR THEIR EXISTING CULTURE WHERE IN THE MANDATED REPORTING RULES CAN BE BENT OR ALTERED BY THE SPECIFIC ORGANIZATION. BY EXTENDING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THE FAILURE OF A MANDATED REPORTER TO REPORT SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. TO WITHIN A ONE YEAR OF DISCOVERY OF THE OFFENSE BUT IN NO CASE LAW- I'M SORRY BUT IN NO CASE LATER THAN FOUR YEARS AFTER THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE. CALIFORNIA LAW WILL BE STRENGTHENED TO BETTER PROTECT VULNERABLE CHILDREN. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT IS STEVEN MARK. ON BEHALF OF THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE- AND- HE'S ON THE PHONE THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER MARK WHAT. I WOULD LIKE MORNING WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM ME AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE TIME THIS MORNING AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOR SPONSORING THIS BILL. MY NAME'S STEPHEN MARQUARDT I'M A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND MUCH OF MY CAREER HAS FOCUSED ON GIVING A VOICE TO VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF ABUSE AND THAT INCLUDES AND THAT. INDIVIDUALS HAVE SUFFERED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE SUFFERED PHYSICAL ABUSE AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE SUFFERED SEXUAL ABUSE. CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN ARE NOT ISOLATED TO THE HOME. SADLY CHILDREN ARE ABUSED IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE HOME. AND FOR THIS REASON THE LAW IDENTIFIED NEARLY FIFTY CLASSES OF INDIVIDUALS AS MANDATED REPORTERS WHO ARE REQUIRED TO CONTACT THE PROPER INVESTIGATIVE AGENCIES WHEN THEY KNOW OR REASONABLY SUSPECTED OF ABUSE. THIS IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN ARE SAFE AND EVERYTHING. WHEN CHILDREN ARE AT SCHOOL IN A SPORTS LEAGUE AT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE IN AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. THEY CAN RELY ON THE ADULTS AROUND THEM TO PUT THEIR INTERESTS AT THE FOREFRONT. HOWEVER IN MY WORK I HAVE FOUND MANY SITUATIONS WHERE MANDATED REPORTERS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR LEGAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS. THIS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REAL ALREADY LEGALLY. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. BUT THE CHILDREN AT INCREASED RISK. IT BECAUSE OF THE WE GOT THE CHILDREN TO SUFFER CONTINUED HARM OF FAILURE TO REPORT CAN ALSO EXPOSE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN TO FUTURE HEART. PINE ABUSER WHO COULD HAVE BEEN AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED. THE FAILURE TO REPORT SHIELD THE ABUSER AND CANNON BALLED IN THE ABUSER TO COMMIT ADDITIONAL HARM BECAUSE THERE IS NO CONSEQUENCE. AND THE FAILURE TO REPORT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO A GENERAL DISTRUST IN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AS THE FAILURE TO REPORT BY MANDY TO REPORT RESULTS IN A SYSTEM WIDE FAILURE TO INTERVENE AND PROVIDE EIGHT. CHILDREN WHO ARE OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT REGULARLY EXPERIENCE SHAME GUILT AND ISOLATION. BECAUSE CHILDREN OFTEN DO NOT REPORT BEING ABUSED IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE MANDATED REPORTERS MAKE THE REPORT WHEN THEY KNOW OR SUSPECT ABUSE. BY THE TIME OF FAILURE TO REPORT IS DISCOVERED OFTENTIMES EVIDENCE OF THE ORIGINAL ABUSE IS PERMANENTLY LOST OR ADDITIONAL ABUSE OF THE SAME CHILD OR OTHER CHILDREN WILL HAVE TAKEN PLACE. THE FAILURE REPORT THEREFORE IS NOT AN ISOLATED ACT BUT IT IS A CONTINUING FAILURE WITH ON GOING NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS FAR BEYOND THE ORIGINAL. ABUSE GIVEN THAT CHILDREN WHO SUFFER ABUSE COMMONLY DELAYED DISCLOSURE OF THE REVIEW. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE MANDATE REPORTER REPORT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS IS ALREADY REQUIRED BY THE LAW. VERY OFTEN HOWEVER IT IS MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE AN ABUSE VICTIM COMES FORWARD. IN THOSE SITUATIONS BY THE TIME A CHILD COMES FORWARD TO REPORT ABUSE AND OFTEN TIMES I'VE SEEN CHILDREN COMING FORWARD SAYING THAT THEY ALREADY LET SOMEBODY KNOW EARLY ON. BUT NOTHING WAS DONE IN THOSE SITUATIONS IF A YEAR HAD PASSED THAT ORIGINAL MANDATED REPORTER WHO WITH THE WHERE OR SUSPECTED OF THE ABUSE. CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY RECOGNIZED THAT CHILD VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE REGULARLY DELAY REPORTING. AND FOR THAT REASON IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AMENDED PENAL CODE SECTION EIGHT A ONE POINT SIX TO EXTEND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THE FAILURE BY A MAN WHO THE REPORTER. TO REPORT SUSPECTED SEXUAL ABUSE TO FIVE YEARS. HOWEVER THE STATUTE LIMITATIONS REMAINED ONE YEAR FOR INCIDENT OF KNOWN OR SUSPECTED PHYSICAL ABUSE AND SEVERE NEGLECT. BUT THE FAILURE TO REPORT BY MANDY REPORTER WHEN THEY KNOW OF OR SUSPECT SEXUAL ABUSE. IS A IS A MISDEMEANOR CRIME UNDER THE CURRENT LAW AND THAT SCHEDULE IMITATION THAT FIVE YEARS HOWEVER IF ANOTHER CHILD SUFFERED PHYSICAL ABUSE OR SEVERE NEGLECT IN A MANDATED REPORTER FAILED TO REPORT IT. THE STATURE LIMITATIONS IT'S ONLY ONE YEAR THIS BILL AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS DISPARITY AND PROVIDE INCREASED PROTECTION TO ALL CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING ABUSED OR SEVERELY NEGLECTED. THE BILL DOES NOT INCREASE PENALTIES IT DOES NOT CRIMINALIZE ANY ACT OR FAILURE THAT IS NOT ALREADY CODIFIED IT SIMPLY GIVES GREATER PROTECTION TO CHILDREN RECOGNIZING HOW CHILD PSYCHOLOGY OPERATE AND RECOGNIZING THAT CURRENTLY. THERE ARE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THESE CRIMES GO UNDETECTED AND IT AIMS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY MANDATED TO REPORT. DO SO BY PRIORITIZING THE CHILDREN THANK YOU.

YES I'LL BE ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN YOU MAKE CHAIR MEMBERS AB TWO THIRDS TWENTY THREE NINETY EIGHT WILL HELP WORKING FAMILIES PREVENT UNNECESSARY VEHICLE REPAIR COSTS DUE TO CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS. KEVORK CONVERTER CRIME IS A GROWING PROBLEM THAT ESPECIALLY IMPACTS MOTORISTS WHO CAN AT LEAST WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD THE SNIFFING IT COSTS TO REPLACE THE DEVICE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSURANCE CRIME PAROLE IN ICB STUDY THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT REPORTED CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS PER MONTH. ON AVERAGE ON AVERAGE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO AVERAGE MONTHLY THEFTS REPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND A HUNDRED AND IN. HUNTERDON TO AVERAGE STEPS REPORTED OF THE MONTH OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND NOTED BY THE N. I. C. B. DURING THESE YEARS THE TOP FIVE STATES FOR CATHOLIC CONVERTER THEFTS WERE CALIFORNIA TEXAS MINNESOTA- NORTH CAROLINA ILLINOIS' EAST BAY RECENTLY A RECENT KCRA REPORT INDICATES THAT THE NUMBER REPORTS A CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS HAVE INCREASED OVER. FIFTEEN HUNDRED OVER THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALONE WELL CALIFORNIA HAS LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THE DEATH OF THESE DEVICES AS WELL AS GOVERNED RECYCLE TREND TRANSACTIONS WITH DETACHED CATHOLIC CONVERTERS. THE PERSON WHO POSSESSES THE DEVICE MAY NOT BE THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE THEFT AND PROVIDING THE ELEMENT- OF THE THEFT CAN BE. DIFFICULT SKEWS ME PROSECUTORS AS WELL AS CRIME VICTIMS WOULD BE BENEFITED BY THE LAW THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT POSSESSION OF THE DETACHED CATHOLIC CONVERTER WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OR VALID REASON IS UNLAWFUL. WELL THERE ARE A FEW CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A PERSON WOULD WOULD HAVE A VALID REASON TO POSSESS A DETACHED CATALYTIC CONVERTER AB TWO THIRTY. AB TWENTY THREE NINETY EIGHT ACCOUNTS FOR THOSE RARE OCCASIONS BY EXEMPTING. PERSON WHO CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY OWN THE VEHICLE FROM WHICH THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER CAME OR HAVE WRITTEN OR AUTHORIZATION FROM THE OWNER. RECYCLE INVOLVED IN THE LAW FOR TRANSACTION PERSON INVOLVED IN A BONAFIDE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIAL. ENGAGED IN A LAW FOR ACTIVITY WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE TWEAKS THAT EXISTS THAT TRICKS TO EXIST EXEMPTIONS THAT WOULD. WOULD HELP MAKE THIS MORE COMPLETE COMBAT FOR THE GROWING POPULATION. BECAUSE LEGISLATION COUNCIL HOUSE OP. THAT THIS BILL. AMEND PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN IS APPROVED THE QUESTION WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS IT SEEMS ARE. INAPPROPRIATE TO GIVE THE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO RE EXAMINE THIS POLICY ELIMINATE THE CHORES WE BLOCK THAT. WILL BELONG TO THE VOTERS WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY SHERIFF PAT WITHROW AND COREY CELL ZERO ZERO ZERO. REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. JEFF YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU VICE CHAIRPERSON THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M HERE TODAY. TO REALLY TRY AND HAMMER HOME HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY THIS IS JUST EXPLODED THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY THIS CRIME AND WHAT IT IS A LOOPHOLE. IN OUR EXISTING LAWS THAT ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW WHILE BACK CATALYTIC CONVERTERS DIDN'T EVEN EXIST AND NOW THEY DO ON MOST OUR CARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS A LOOPHOLE THAT IS INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO BECOME CRIMINALS PEOPLE WHO WOULD NORMALLY NOT GO OUT AND COMMIT CRIMES ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE- IT'S SO PROFITABLE TO THEM IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO RESIST I'VE- JUST GOT SOME RECENT EXAMPLES WHERE WE'RE GONNA CASE RIGHT NOW. WHERE WE HAD ONE GUY IN OUR COUNTY THAT WAS ACCEPTING THESE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS FROM PEOPLE THAT WOULD JUST GO OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT OR THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY ROLL UNDERNEATH THE CAR WITH A BATTERY OPERATED SAWS ALL. CUT IT OFF A PERSON'S CAR AND THEN TAKE IT TO THIS GUY AND TRADED IN AND THEY GO FOR UP TO FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF VEHICLE THEY CAME OFF OF. THE PREVIOUS IS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONES- THAT THEY CAN GET THE MOST PRECIOUS METALS OUT OF THESE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AND- WHEN WE- DID SURVEILLANCE AND WORK THE BIG CASE UP ON THIS GUY ACCEPTING ALL THESE- WE FOUND DOCUMENTATION THE THAT HE HAD MADE SO FAR THIS LAST YEAR. ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS JUST THIS ONE PERSON IN DEALING IN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS TAKING THEM DOWN TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SELLING THEM SO WE'RE WE PUSH REALLY HARD FOR NEW LEGISLATION AND OUR LOCAL DA TORY VERBAS SALAZAR WHO'S A- MEMBER OF THE PROSECUTOR'S ALLIANCE AND I BELIEVE THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I MEAN THE DA'S OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE TOOL SIX. LAW LIKE- GRAND THEFT DOESN'T EXIST ON THIS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS ONCE IT'S OFF THE VEHICLE YOU CANNOT PROVE WHICH VEHICLE IT CAME OFF OF THEIR ART. DEDICATED NUMBERS LIKE SERIAL NUMBERS ON A HAND GUN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO PROVE THIS. AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO LITERALLY MAKE A NEW CAR A NEW CRIME HERE A BILL OR A LOT FOR A NEW. CRIME WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THE LOOPHOLE THAT IS HERE. IT'S LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT ARE BEING DEVASTATED BY THIS FAMILIES THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE A DAY OFF BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS VICTIMIZED IN THIS WAY. THEY CAN'T AFFORDTO NOT GET THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE TO TRANSPORT THEM. AND BY MAKING IT A WOBBLER IT'S GIVING THE- DISTRICT ATTORNEYS THE JUDGES AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S. TO FIND THOSE PEOPLE WHO. AREN'T THE HARDENED CRIMINALS THAT ARE MAKING THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF OF THIS TO SOMEBODY WHO JUST TOOK A OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND MAKE SOME MONEY. TO HELP HIS FAMILY AND MAKE IT A MISDEMEANOR GET HIM INTO COURT GET HIM SOME TYPE OF DIVERSION- BUT STILL REPRESENT THE FAMILIES THAT ARE BEING VICTIMIZED BY THIS. SO IT IS IT IS AN IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITY LIKE YOU CAN'T BELIEVE AND IT'S EVERY SINGLE NIGHT LAST NIGHT WE GOT A STOLEN VEHICLE THAT HAD I DON'T KNOW FIVE OR TEN OF THIS TO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS IN IT. AND THEY GO IN CHARGE BECAUSE THE DIEGO IS YES OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE STOLEN OFF OF CARS ARE CUT OFF ON EITHER END AND YOU'RE IN POSSESSION OF THEM. BUT BECAUSE E CANNOT PROVE WHICH CAR IT CAME FROM AND WHO THE VICTIM IS NO ONE IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS SO THERE IS NO DETERRENTS. TO KEEP PEOPLE FOR GOING INTO THIS BUSINESS OF VICTIMIZING OUR CITIZENS DEVASTATING THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET TO WORK AND OFTENTIMES THE VEHICLE ITSELF. ISN'T OF VALUE TO WHAT IT TAKES TO REPAIR THE CAR SO THEY LOSE THEIR VEHICLES. SO THIS IS YOU KNOW IT'S IMPACTFUL BUT NOT AS IMPACTFUL TO PEOPLE LIKE US WHO HAVE A GOOD INSURANCE ON OUR VEHICLES OR OR CAN GET TIME OFF WORK IN. AND HAVE THE MONEY THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IT TAKES TO REPLACE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER ON A CAR. BUT FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S WHO'S WORKING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK LIKE MOST THE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. THIS IS A DEVASTATING SO WE'RE HOPING THIS WILL BE A HUGE DETERRENTS WHEN WE STOP THE CAR AND YOU HAVE A CATALYTIC CONVERTER THAT IS. YOU CANNOT PROVE THAT IT THE THAT YOU LEGALLY POSSESS THAT. THEN WE CAN GET YOU INTO THE SYSTEM AND EITHER GET YOU THE HELP YOU NEED OR STOP YOU FROM VICTIMIZING OUR CITIZENS- SO I WOULD ASK THAT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. THAT YOU THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SERVICE SOCIAL RESEARCHER MEMBERS COURCELLES ALONG BEHALF K. TWENTY. SKINNY COW. SURE SYSTEM- THE SPOTS OF THE BILL AND ANY. BUT THE AUTHOR- AND THE SHERIFF I THINK OF LATE ABOUT WE ARE- THE SIMPLY MAKING CLEAR THAT THE POSSESSION OF THESE DETACHED DEVICES. IS WHAT'S UNLAWFUL- IF WE CAN PROVE THE THEFT THEM THAT WILL BE THE CASE WE OFTEN CAN'T- AND SO JUST CLARIFYING THAT THE BILL HAS A NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS FOR SITUATIONS IN WHICH IT MAKES SENSE THAT A PERSON MIGHT. POSSESS A DETACHED CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND IF THOSE EXEMPTIONS NEED ADDITIONAL- TWEAKING WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THAT'S IN THE ROOM. AT&amp;T. WE HAVE AN A. S. SUPPORTERS ARE LIKE TO EXPRESS THAT SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS. ONE ZERO IN MY FIRST THAT WENT SEVENTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD ADVOCACY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THERE ARE A COUPLE WITH APPARATED TO BE JUST A MOMENT. I'M GOING TO LINE THE SIXTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING AMANDA CALDERON WITH TRIPLE A IN SUPPORT THANKS. THANK YOU ARE NOW LINE THIRTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION AND SUPPORT. AND AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THINK YOU PLEASE CONTINUE. OKAY THANK YOU OPPOSITION IF YOU'D LIKE TO STEP FORWARD AND- EXPRESS YOUR TESTIMONY. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU VICE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU COMMITTEE GOING BACK AS FOR THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THE PROPONENTS HAVE NOT PROVEN. AS PENALTY WILL REDUCE CRIME OR REDUCE THEFT OF CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. THERE IS HOWEVER NOT A CONSENSUS IN ALL RESEARCH THAT IT'S NOT THE FEAR OF A HIGH PENALTY BUT THE FEAR OF APPREHENSION THAT DETERS CRIME INCREASING THE PENALTY WILL NOT DETER CRIME. SO ALSO NOT PROVEN THAT PROP FORTY SEVEN IS THE REASON THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN CRIME. THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASES IN PROPERTY CRIME AND VIOLENT CRIME THROUGHOUT THE U. S. IN THE TIME OF COLD IT. IT HAPPENED IN JURISDICTIONS THAT WERE TOUGH ON CRIME HAPPENED IN JURISDICTIONS ARE MORE. I WAS INTELLIGENT AND CAREFUL IN THEIR APPLICATION OF INCARCERATION. THE CURRENT PENALTY FOR THEFT OF THIS ITEM IS SIX MONTHS IN JAIL. A THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE AND RESTITUTION TO THE VICTIM. WHY ARE WE TOLD THE SIX MONTHS TO FIND A RESTITUTION IS NOT ENOUGH ENOUGH WHY ARE WE ALWAYS PUSHING FOR NEW FELONIES WHITE IS THE DA'S. INSURANCE PUSH FOR NEW FELONIES WHY IS SIX MONTHS AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY NOT ENOUGH WIFE SIX MONTHS OF YOUR LIFE NOT ENOUGH. WE ASK THAT. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. ENFORCE THE LAWS AS WRITTEN. IT'S UP TO US COLLECTIVELY. TO RESPECT THE EVIDENCE THAT ABOUT WHAT DOES DETER CRIME WHAT DOES PROTECT PEOPLE. IT'S UP TO US COLLECTIVELY TO RESPECTIVE OWNERS MANDATE. AND RESPECT FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION- I WOULD ECHO MISTER BACCHUS IS COMMENTS BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT- NOT ONLY IS- AB TWENTY THREE NINETY EIGHT A BAD PUBLIC POLICY BECAUSE IT TRIES TO RETURN US TO THE BAD OLD DAYS OF EVERY OFFENSE IS A FELONY. BUT IT HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. BUT EVEN MORE PERNICIOUS HEY IS AB TWENTY THREE NINETY EIGHTHS METHOD WHICH IS BASICALLY TO CREATE ALMOST A STRICT LIABILITY OFFENCE IF YOU HAVE A CATALYTIC CONVERTER. IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY YOU'RE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT AND NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT IT CAME FROM THE VEHICLE YOUR VEHICLE BUT ALSO THAT YOU KNEW AHEAD OF TIME TO- HAVE IT INSCRIBED WITH THE VIN NUMBER. AT LET ME GIVE YOU A REAL LIFE EXAMPLES SO- I LIVE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA- AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT THERE A BUNCH OF PREVIOUS'S- IN OAKLAND BERKELEY. AND MY NEIGHBOR HAD- HIS CATALYTIC CONVERTER STOLEN. NOW IF HE HAD DECIDED TO GET IN HIS TRUCK. HE DID HAVE ANOTHER VEHICLE AND DRIVE AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND FOR WHATEVER REASON THE- THIEVES HAD DECIDED TO TOSS HIS CATALYTIC CONVERTER OUT ON THE STREET. IF HE HAD PICKED IT UP AND PUT IT IN THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK AND THEN STOPPED FOR A TRAFFIC OFFENSE ON THE WAY HOME. THEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR A FELONY BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO WAY. TO PROVE. THAT THAT WAS HIS CATALYTIC CONVERTER. BECAUSE HE COULD TAKE HIM TO HIS HOUSE AND SHOW A LOOK SEE WHAT DOES THERE'S NO CATALYTIC CONVERTER ON MY PREVIOUS. BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE A VIN NUMBER INSCRIBED ON IT- BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST ECHO- TWO THINGS ONE I THINK THE PROPONENTS SAID THAT THEY HAD- COME ACROSS SOMEBODY WHO HAD- ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF.CATALYTIC CONVERTERS THIS IS THE WHO VISIBILITY SIX TO GO AFTR THEY'RE NOT GOING AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON RECYCLING AND THE TAKING THIS TO THE FENCES BASICALLY THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE WHO STEAL THEM AND THAT IS A CRIME OF POVERTY. SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON A BILL TWENTY THREE NINETY EIGHT. OKAY IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM THOUGH LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION PLEASE COLLECTION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU THERE ARE NO OTHERS WILL GO TO THE PHONE PHONE LINES. OPERATOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHT TWENTY THREE NINETY EIGHT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THEM. THANK YOU. IF YOUR POST PLEASE PRESS AND ONE THEN ZERO. AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO PARTICIPANT THANK YOU. THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MISCALCULATE FIRST OF ALL I HAVE A CALL LAST NIGHT. JUST LAST NIGHT FROM SOMEONE WHO DOES REPAIRS HE'S ALSO CITY COUNCIL MEMBER DID HE HAS A REPAIR SHOP AND HE TALKED TO ME ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POVERTY ALREADY LOSING THEIR CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND LOSING THEIR AUTOMOBILE. AND- POSSIBLY ENDING UP HOMELESS BECAUSE OF IT SO IT IS A BIG PROBLEM. HOWEVER YOUR BILL JUST NEEDS A LOT OF WORK AND I CAN'T VOTE FOR IT AT THIS TIME FIRST FALL. YOU REALLY SHOULD LEAVE. THE CURRENT- IN MY OPINION THE CURRENT PUNISHMENT IN PLACE- AS WAS SAID BY THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE ELLA BAKER CENTER- A MISDEMEANOR WHERE YOU'RE SIX MONTHS IN JAIL AND GETTING FIND AT CENTER I THINK IS A DETERRENT. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IS QUESTION OF ATTRIBUTION. SO WHAT THE WHAT SHOULD WHAT THE SHERIFF SAID WHAT YOU CAN'T TELL WHO OWNS. THAT CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN CHARGING WHETHER IT'S PETTY THEFT OR GRAND THEFT- THEY CAN'T PROVE WHO THE VICTIM OF THE CRIME IS EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT'S BEEN TAKEN OFF THE VEHICLE. YEAH SO SOMEONE HAS CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEY CAN'T PROVE THAT IT'S THERE'S EITHER. WELL THEY COULD HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR VEHICLE THAT CAME OFF OF- WITH THEIR VIN NUMBER FROM THAT VEHICLE- SHOWING THAT- THEY HAD TAKEN IT OFF THEIR OWN VEHICLE AND THAT.WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR US TO SAY OKAY- WE CAN GO BACK AND VERIFY THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS YOURS SO YEAH BUT GIVEN THAT- YES THIS. REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SAID. IT DOESN'T HAVE A VIN NUMBER ON IT SO PROVING YET THAT IT SURE SOUNDS VERY DIFFICULT I THINK THESE THINGS NEED TO BE CORRECTED I THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY TO CORRECT THEM WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY HAVING FIVE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. WE NEED TO MAKE THAT A CRIME- WHETHER IT'S A MISDEMEANOR WOBBLER WE CAN DISCUSS BUT IF IT'S FIVE OF THEM PROBABLY IT IS ENOUGH. TO MAKE IT A FELONY- BUT RIGHT NOW YOU'RE MAKING IT YOU GOT TO PROVE THAT THAT MONEY IS YOURS AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME HOW YOU DO THAT. THESE THINGS NEED TO BE CORRECTED IN THE BELL AND WHAT I'D ASK THE AUTHOR TO THINK ABOUT. OUR IS EITHER WITHDRAWING THE BILL AT THIS POINT AND ASKING THE COMMITTEE TO WORK ON IT WITH HIM. OR IS IF IT IS VOTED DOWN- THAN TO ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION WORK WITH COMMITTEE I JUST THINK THERE ARE TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL RIGHT NOW. BUT I THINK THEY CAN BE CORRECTED AND THERE IS A PROBLEM IF YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE SOMEBODY WHO HAS FIVE. CATALYTIC CONVERTERS THAT'S FOR SURE. SO I'M- I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY TO FIX THIS BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO IT TODAY THANK YOU. THIS IS YOUR QUESTION FOR- THE SHERIFF- IN IN TRYING TO PROSECUTE THIS CRIME ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THEY GO UNDERNEATH. EVEN IF THEY'RE CAUGHT IN THE ACT UNLESS THEY'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER OFF YOU CAN'T CHARGING FOR BURGLARY IT'S JUST VANDALISM THAT'S CORRECT CORRECT. SO WE'RE REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS A WAY ESPECIALLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR. CRIME TO BE PROSECUTED TO BE SOMEBODY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING IT- THIS THIS TO ME ALSO HAS A GREATER EFFECT ON AREAS WHERE. WE'LL TRADITIONALLY DON'T HAVE. THEIR CARS PROTECTED IN A GARAGE AS SO THEY'RE LINED UP ON THE STREETS AND A LOT OF BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT WE KEEP BRINGING UP ABOUT BEING OVERLY IMPACTED. WELL THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GETTING OVERLY IMPACTED THEY'VE THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES. ARE- DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. ARE BECAUSE THEY WERE AVAILABILITY OF VEHICLES OUTSIDE AWAY FROM WHERE THEY MIGHT RESIDE AND SO IF THE NOISE FROM STEALING THE CATHOLIC CONVERTER. OR THE FEAR OF CONFRONTING SOMEBODY STEALING ONE IS NOT- IT AB IF NOBODY'S GONNA GO REPORT IT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO CATCH THESE FOLKS AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO. AND WHILE IT DOES HAVE SOME TROUBLES I THINK SEEN THAT IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND THIS ISSUE IS GROWING IT JUST LIKE JUST LIKE FINALLY HITS IT'S GROWING EXPONENTIALLY AND IT'S AFFECTING THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WE SAY WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE INSTEAD OF TAKING THE APPROACH OF PULL IT IS I WOULD LIKE TO. **** COMMITTEE TO LET THIS BILL GO OUT AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THAT WITH OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE SERIOUS MORE WAY MORE SERIOUS FLAWS IN THIS. AND IN BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN IT GOES TO OUR FINAL VOTE- WE'RE ABLE TO- DISCERN WHETHER. OUR OUR ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. AND SO I WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE TO ALLOW THIS BILL TO GO OUT. AND BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN WE SEE IT AGAIN- WE DETERMINE WHETHER- BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THAT OPTION DETERMINE WHETHER IT EXISTS IT DID IS SUCCESSFUL IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES. THAT WE HAVE BUT AND I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO% WORK ON THIS BILL BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS BILL WE DON'T HAVE ANY BILL. AND ANOTHER YEAR AND SOME CHANGE BEFORE WE START LOOKING AT WHAT WE DO ABOUT THIS. AND THE SHERIFFS WHO ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ARE LEFT. HAND CUFFED. IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WE KEEP SAYING WE'RE TRYING TO HELP SO I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL AND I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S SOME WORK MAY BE DONE ON IT- I WILL BE VOTING YES AND HOPE. MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN US IN CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS INTO A BILL THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY THANK YOU. IF I COULD IF I CAN OUT OF THE PROJECT FOR MY HEALTH TODAY AND- THIS. THIS BILL THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU SEE IT. ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA. IT IT'S THE I'M STOCKTON CALIFORNIA. OKAY SO. WE'RE TALKING PEOPLE OF COLOR GUESS WHAT KIND OF MY COMMUNITY. AND YOU YOU ARE WHERE I. LIVE AND LOVE MY COMMUNITY. BUT YOU'RE CATCHING FOLKS THAT ARE. THE LITTLE OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE WITH FILMING IT. OUR OUR- MY OWN PEOPLE. AND BECAUSE NOTHING IS BEING DONE. SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING I'LL BE HONEST THERE KNOCKING HIM OUT. THERE BEATING HIM UP. BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING BEING PREVENTIVE OUT THERE. I'M TALKING I HAVE I HAVE A LADY. WHO WORKS AT AT THE HOSPITAL IN OUR CAR'S PROBABLY WORTH. YOU KNOW THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS. SHE CAN'T GET TO WORK NOW BECAUSE IT'S GONE SHE CALLED UP THE OFFICE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SOUNDS LIKE A TRACTOR. YOU KNOW IT WAS A CATALYTIC CONVERTER SO SHE HAD TO BORROW HER BROTHER'S CAR. TO GET TO WORK NOW I'M TALKING HERE'S A LADY HAS LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. AND WE'RE SO WE'RE WE'RE OVER HERE TALKING ABOUT PREVENTING PUTTING MONEY IN THE HOMELESS BEEN PUT IN HOUSING WHEN HERE IS A LADY THAT IS LITERALLY TRYING TO DO WHAT'S GOOD IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND SHE'S YEAH SHE IS YOU KNOW WOMEN OF COLOR. AND TRYING TO DO WORK EVERY DAY TRYING TO TAKE. IT OUT OVER TIME. TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THE YET WERE WORKBOOK FOR PENALIZING FOLKS LIKE THAT. AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY PUSHING THEM TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT FORGET IT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO WHY SHOULD I GO TO WORK. RIGHT BECAUSE- I CANNOT AFFORD IT NOW PROGRAM WITH THE RATHER. SHE CAN USE A CAR SHE DOESN'T KNOW SHE TO WORK OVERTIME BECAUSE HE'S WORKING. SENIORS IN MY COMMUNITY A FIXED INCOME AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD THIS THEY GET THE STONE THAT'S GUESS WHAT THEY'RE DIE. THE RELYING ON ON RELATIVES TO BRING THEM FOOD WERE THEY RELIED TO GET IN THAT CAR JUST TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE TO HAVE A SOCIAL HOUR. JUST TO SIT THERE AND TALK TO THE BUTCHER OR THE PERSON THAT'S YOU KNOW AT THE AT THE CHECK OUT STAND JUST TO HAVE A- A CUP OF COFFEE AND HAVE A YOU KNOW A SOCIAL LIFE. THAT WERE PREVENTING THAT. SO I MEAN IT'S MORE AB WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ADD. YOU KNOW TO GET. FOLKS MORE ARRESTED AT ALL THAT'S- BY FAR. I HOPE THE SHERIFF CAME ACROSS THAT. BECAUSE WE HAVE A GREAT CHEF HERE. HAS WORKED SO HARD. TO WORK IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND BELIEVES OUR COMMUNITY. AND I'M I'M TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING HERE. I'M TIRED OF WATCHING THIS ON SOCIALLY I'M TIRED OF HEARING THE PHONE CALLS AT WORK WHAT DO YOU DOING THAT IS BEING THERE. AND I'M- YEAH I'M A SOPHOMORE APPEAR. I'M TRYING TO FIGHT HARD TO MAKE SURE. I THE DOCTOR TOLD ME WAS YOU KNOW STAMKOS YOU SHOULD NOT BUT I WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY. BECAUSE THIS BILL MEANS A LOT BUT JUST FOR MY DISTRICT. ON TOP OF FOR YOUR DISTRICT WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE. EVERY TIME A BILL LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGHT AND PUT INCARCERATED NO. I'M TRYING TO I'M GOING AFTER TO SUPPORTING MY COMMUNITY. MY COLOR COMMITTEE. SURE THAT THEY'RE WORKING THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY GET. FROM A TO B. M. THIRTEEN THIRTY. SAFE SO I ASKED TODAY I MEAN YOU KNOW AGAIN I'M GONNA GO BACK. WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESS FOLKS ALL THE TIME WE TALK ABOUT MAKE CHANGES IN OUR COMMUNITY. HERE HERE IT IS WE'RE FOR PUTTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND THIS IS A THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO WORK DON'T HAVE THEY DON'T DON'T THE LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK IN MY DISTRICT. AND WHEN THEY GET THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER STOLEN. THEY'RE ALMOST THERE ALMOST ALMOST THERE. THAT COULD BACK OUT OF THE CONVERTERS WORTH MORE THAN THE CAR. SO I ASKED I AM SHE GOES SUPER I MEAN I'D BE WILLING TO WORK WITH WITH THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES ON THIS ABSOLUTELY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING SOMETHING OR TO ME THAT WE ARE PROTECTING OUR- THOSE FOLKS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT. THOSE FOLKS IN YOUR DISTRICT. RIGHT GUESTS WERE IN QUESTION ANSWER THAT SOUNDED MORE LIKE A CLOSE WITH. GREAT MISTER BY. YEAH NOT. ET YOU TALK ABOUT- DISHES WE STRUGGLE REPRESENT CHRIS OUR DISTRICT AND I KNOW THE CHAIR GEN I SURE SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES- AND I UNDERSTAND. THAT FEELING WHEN YOU HAVE A CONSTITUENT CALL OR SEVERAL AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE CHANGES IS IN YOUR HANDS. ON FOR ME TODAY THE STRUGGLE IS. WHAT'S BEEN SAID A FEW TIMES IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ADD A NEW CRIME AND WE DON'T WANT TO ADD NEW PENALTIES BUT THAT EFFECTIVELY IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES WITH THE WOBBLER AND THE CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF THE EXISTING CRIME AND RAISES THE PENALTY AND IT CREATES A NEW CATEGORY BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY AND WE KNOW WOBBLIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT. BLACK BROWN POINT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE BECAUSE THE DISCRETION TO GO FELONY OR OTHERWISE OFTEN FALLS ON IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS AND NOT ALWAYS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT MISDEMEANOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS BLACK BROWN POOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND SO I HOPE THAT IF THIS BILL DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT TODAY IT GOES TO THE RECONSIDERATION PROCESS. SAID WE CAN GET YOU OF SOMETHING YOU CAN TAKE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY- TO SHOW THE WORK THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY FEW LEGISLATORS IN THIS BUILDING OR FIGHTING HARDER THAN YOU ARE FOR YOUR DISTRICT AND I SEE THAT AND I THINK THAT YOUR CONSTITUENCY THAT TOO BUT- FOR THE- REASONS EXPLAINED EARLIER I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. EVERY WILL IT WORK ACT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. YES YES MR LACKEY. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ATTENTION TO THIS I KNOW IT TOOK SOME GUTS BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVEN SOME. SOME DISCOURAGING INFORMATION ALONG THE WAY. AND I REALLY WISH THAT EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE UNDERSTOOD. HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM THE SAYS AND- THE PEOPLE THE OFFENDERS ARE ACTUALLY EXPLOITING THE LACK OF REMEDY THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM- AND IT'S VERY VERY TEMPTING FOR THOSE. WHO ARE STRUGGLING. TO GAIN A LOT OF MONEY QUICK. AND SO WE AS POLICYMAKERS HAVE RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS ARE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AND WEEK TO SUMMARILY DISMISS. SOLUTIONS BECAUSE IT PUTS US IN A COMFORTABLE SPACE. SHAME ON US FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO STEP OUTSIDE OF OUR COMFORT ZONE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT I'M TELLING YOU FOLKS IN IN MY DISTRICT I KNOW OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THIS IS BEEN THE STRAW TO BREAK THE CAMEL'S BACK. PEOPLE REALLY ARE WE DO WE TALK ABOUT IT HERE. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US UP HERE LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. BUT WHEN YOU DO. IT'S A TERRIBLE WORLD TO BE IN. IT CHANGES YOUR ABILITY TO BE HAPPY AND I'M TELLING YOU THIS PROBLEM HAS DONE THAT TO PEOPLE. IT IS PUT THEM IN A PLACE THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO A POINT OF DESPERATION THAT IF WE HAD SOME PUBLIC POLICY TO ADDRESS THIS. THEY MAY NOT BE IN THAT POSITION THEY MAY NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE STAFF THAT'S- I MEAN BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT IN THAT THAT JUNE WHERE. FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. DEVASTATES PEOPLE. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW OF ANY- FIX. FOR THIS PARTICULAR THEFT- FOR THESE A CATALYTIC CONVERTERS THAT IS LESS THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS I THINK IT'S WELL BEYOND THAT AND IN MANY CASES BUT- I JUST WISH. THE OTHERS ON THIS COMMITTEE WOULD SEE THE IMPORTANCE AND THE NECESSITY FOR SOME INTERVENTION INDICATED WE AT WE HAVE- PAST WORKS IN PROGRESS PROGRESS BEFORE AND IF IT DOESN'T MEET THE EXPECTATION AND WE WEREN'T ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THIS THING YOU VOTED DOWN WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. SO I'M CLEARLY SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE I'M VERY THANKFUL THAT YOU HAD THE COURAGE TO ADDRESS IT IT MAY NOT BE WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. BUT WE CAN WORK ON THAT AND I HOPE THE PEOPLE GIVEN A CHANCE. MANY OTHER. I COULD SAY YOU MAY CLOSE WITH THE GO AHEAD- I JUST. I WOULD SAY THAT I'D BE WILLING TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU I MEAN IT'S NOT. MY BILL IT'S ALL IT AFFECTS ALL OF YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT SO IT. I HOPE YOU WOULD REALLY RECONSIDER THIS IS NOT ABOUT. OUR DISTRICT IT'S ABOUT ALL YOUR DISTRICTS SO WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. OKAY EDIT WHAT AT THE IVAN AND SEVERAL MEMBERS HAVE PERSONALLY COME TO ME- SPECIALIST ARE NOT INCLINED TO VOTE FOR THIS TO SAID THAT THEY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. ON THIS- THERE THERE. THEIR PRE ELECTION OR THE WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH YOU IS REALLY IS GOOD IS ADMIRABLE AND IT'S NOT JUST ME IT'S SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- THE REASON THEY WOULD VOTED DOWN AND ASK FOR YOU AFTER RECONSIDERATION IS DON'T WANNA LET IT OUT OF JUST COMMITTEE BECAUSE AS A FRESHMAN WE REALLY DON'T KNOW YOU YET AND SOMETIMES REFLECTS. SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE OKAY WITH THE POLICY OR WHATEVER TO MOVE FORWARD. AND WE'RE PRETTY SURE. THAT THE AUTHOR WILL TWEAK. ACCORDING TO WHAT THE COMMITTEE WANTS THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE WANTS- THE REASON WE DON'T IS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO GET TO KNOW YOU NEED TO GET TO KNOW YOUR SHERIFF AND PEOPLE WERE WHO WERE ADVOCATING FOR THIS WE KEEP WE TRY TO KEEP IT IN THIS COMMITTEE SO THAT WHEN IT DOES GET OUT. IF IT GETS OUT OF IT HAS WHAT THE COMMITTEE FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH EVEN IF IT'S AGAINST WHAT THE OPPOSITION WANT THAT GROUP WERE FORMALLY- WITH THAT WE'VE HAD SOME PEOPLE WILL REFLECT THINGS OUT THERE NOW LOBBYING THE REST OF THE ASSEMBLY INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN THIS COMMITTEE. I WANT TO THANK A- THE CHAIR HERE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF. CALIFORNIA IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND HAS PRIORITIZED COMBATING GUN VIOLENCE THROUGH HISTORIC BUDGET ALLOCATIONS POLICY REFORMS FOR REFORMS AND MORE DESPITE THESE EFFORTS THERE ARE STILL GAPS THAT REMAIN THE STATE'S GUN LAWS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE OR CORPORATIONS TO MANUFACTURE LARGE NUMBERS OF FIREARMS WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH EXISTING PUBLIC SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY SIX WOULD PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY BY CLOSING THE GAPS IN CALIFORNIA'S FIRE FIRE MANUFACTURING LICENSING LAW. BY JANUARY BY GENERALLY REQUIRING A STATE ISSUED MANUFACTURING LICENSE TO ASSEMBLE OR MANUFACTURE THREE GUNS OR MORE PER YEAR. THIS NUMBERS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW UNDER THE UNSAFE HANDGUN ACT AND IS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION FOR INDIVIDUALS MANUFACTURING FIREARMS THAT ARE INTENDED FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL FURTHER CLARIFIES THE SAME LICENSE REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO THREE D. PRINTED GUNS. DATA PROVIDES THAT PRIVATELY MANUFACTURED GHOST GUNS ARE NOW THE LEADING CONTRIBUTOR TO GUN VIOLENCE AND MORE MORE JURISDICTIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR LAWS IN OAKLAND IN A SIX MONTH PERIOD IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OAKLAND PD ESTIMATED ABOUT 25% OR ONE IN FOUR OF THE GUNS THAT WERE RECOVERED WERE GHOST GUNS. ESSENTIALLY AS- TECHNOLOGY INNOVATES THE GUN MANUFACTURERS ARE INNOVATING AND THE CRIMINALS ARE INNOVATING- AND BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE GUNS IN AN UNLICENSED WAY AND SO OUR PUBLIC POLICIES ALSO NEED INNOVATE TO ENSURE THAT. WE KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE WRONG HANDS. IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM FURTHER GUN VIOLENCE WE MUST CLOSE LOOPHOLES AND STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S FIRE MANUFACTURING LAWS. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ARLY ARI FREE LIKE FROM DEFERRED TO BE JOINING US BY PHONE. WE HAVE ALREADY BY PHONE OR BY.

AS SUCH- MY BILL AND INTENTIONALLY ELIMINATED THE BY S. REQUIREMENT THAT AB EIGHT FORTY SIX CREATED IN TWENTY TWENTY UP TO ENSURE THAT THESE BIAS REQUIREMENTS GO INTO EFFECT AND URGENT STATUTORY FIX IS NECESSARY WHICH IS WHY AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY NINE IS BEFORE YOU TODAY.

AT AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY NINE OF THE NECESSARY BILL FOR POST AND POSTERS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING AB EIGHT FORTY SIX AND TWENTY TWENTY AND AS- THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN STATED OVER THE FALL AND FROM IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THE BIASED REQUIREMENT WOULD NO LONGER. IN THE STATUTE- WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE OTHER TOPIC. AND IT BECAME. I PARENTS THAT AB NINETY FROM YEAR. I DIDN'T STRUCK OUT THAT PORTION OF THE LAW. THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS NOT THE INTENTION OF AB TEN NINETY SIX AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE.

THE BILL THE SECOND. I HAVE TO BILL. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE DRUG OFFENSE ALTERNATIVE PLEASE. THE BILL. YOU'RE LOOKING THE BILL. YOU CAN READ IT FIRST. VACANCY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE WHICH WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM THE LASTING COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF DRUG CONVICTIONS DRUG OFFENSES ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THESE CONVICTIONS CAN DESTABILIZE SOMEONE'S LIFE BY BLOCKING ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL RESOURCES SUCH AS HOUSING OBTAINING PROFESSIONAL LICENSES AND COULD JEOPARDIZE PARENTAL RIGHTS. FOR CALIFORNIA'S LARGE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION DRUG CONVICTIONS CAN HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES THAT CAN LEAD TO THE PERMANENT SEPARATION OF FAMILIES LOW LEVEL CONVICTIONS LIKE INFRACTIONS OR MISDEMEANORS POSSESSION CAN SUBJECT NONCITIZEN TO MANDATORY ICE DETENTION WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF RELEASE ON BOND THERE ARE IN A BASIS OF FORTY PART DEPORTATION M. BAR TO MOST FORMS OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE SUPREME COURT OPINION AND PARADE PRETA VERSES BILL CLINTON- WORSENED THE SITUATION FOR IMMIGRANTS BY ELIMINATED ALASKA GRATION NEUTRAL PLEAT OPTION. FOR A DRUG CHARGE IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS THIS WEEK'S NONCITIZEN DEFENDANTS FACING POSSIBLE DRUG CONVICTIONS WITH NO REAL ALTERNATIVE DEFENSE IN A CRIMINAL COURT TO AVOID DEPORTATION PROSECUTORS HAVE NO REALISTIC OPTIONS EVEN WHEN IN EVEN WHEN IN THEIR OWN PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT THEY BELIEVE THE BEST RESULT WOULD BE TO AVOID IMMIGRATION OR OTHER COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES IN A SPECIFIC CASE AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE CREATES AN ALTERNATIVE PLEA FOR THOSE CHARGES WERE SPECIFIED DRUG. OFFENSES WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAME EXPOSURE TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES UNDER THIS LAW PROSECUTORS WILL HAVE DISCRETION TO OFFERED THIS ALTERNATIVE PLEA ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND ONLY AT THE REQUEST OF THE DEFENSE COUNSEL DESPITE AND EFFICIENT AN APPROPRIATE MECHANISM TO VOTE. TO PROTECT IMMIGRANTS AND OTHER STATE. RESIDENTS FROM FACING DRUG CONVICTIONS AND SO OFFERING LIFELONG. THIS BILL WILL PRESERVE COURT RESOURCES AND KEEP COURTS RUNNING EFFICIENTLY BY ALLOWING THE EARLY RESOLUTION OF SPECIFIC DRUG CASES HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT R. CARLOS GOMEZ WITH IMMIGRANT RESOURCE CENTER A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AND GET A REMOTE BOOSTERS WHO WILL SHARE HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU BASICALLY SAID WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY- THE GOOD MORNING- VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS- MY NAME IS CARLA GOMEZ AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE- PRIOR TO JOINING THE ILRC I WAS A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS- AND IN THAT CAPACITY I ALSO SERVED AS THAT. DEPORTATION DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND I FOCUSED ON DETAINED WORK. SO I REALLY HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE DEVASTATING A FAX OF. CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS EVEN MINOR DRUG CONVICTIONS LIKE MINOR- DRUG CONVICTIONS FOR PERSONAL USE- HAVE ON BOTH OUR CITIZENS AND OUR NON CITIZENS I AM. SO AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE BASICALLY SETS OUT TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO BOTH. SO AS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER ALREADY ELOQUENTLY STATED FOR I WERE NONCITIZENS- SORRY FOR OUR CITIZENS DRUG CONVICTIONS CAN LEAD TO LOSS OF HOUSING- AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE MANY OF MY YOUNG CLIENTS OF COLOR AFTER THEY SUFFERED A DRUG CONVICTION- THEY WERE HOMELESS THEY BECAME HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T RETURN BACK TO. THEIR FOR THEIR FAMILY THAT LIVED IN SECTION EIGHT HOUSING AND- FOR THOSE CLIENTS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO REHABILITATE AND YEARS LATER WANT TO OBTAIN SOME SORT OF A LICENSING LIKE AT A NURSING LICENSE FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SO. AND THEY CANNOT EVEN BECOME IN HOME CARE PROVIDERS IF THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE LIKE A LOVED ONE IN THEIR FAMILY. SO FOR NONCITIZENS DAY AND THAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE FAR WORSE. OF FOR OUR NONCITIZEN CLIENTS INCLUDING INCLUDING LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS A DRUG CONVICTION LEADS TO MANDATORY ICE DETENTION DOESN'T HAVE DISCRETION TO SET A BOND. LEADS TO DEPORTATION. AND THE INABILITY TO ADJUST TO STATUS SO THAT MEANS THAT IF SOMEONE IS MARRIED TO A US CITIZEN OR HAVE US CITIZEN CHILDREN THEY CANNOT OBTAIN A GREEN CARD. AND IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT WE HAD A LOT LAST KIND OF LINE OF DEFENSE AND IF WE DIDN'T NAME THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE- WE COULD AVOID THE CONVICTION THE DRUG CONVICTION FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES. UNFORTUNATELY LAST YEAR THE SUPREME COURT AND PRAY THAT THE WILKINSON OVERTURNED THIS LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. SO WE CANNOT WE CAN'T DO THAT AND WE DON'T HAVE MANY PTIONS ANYMORE. SO AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE PROVIDES A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE THAT PROSECUTORS CAN OFFER IN LIEU OF A OF A DRUG OFFENSE. AND THIS BILL IS NOT A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD AT ALL. THROUGH THIS MEASURE PROSECUTORS THE PROSECUTORS WILL HAVE THE DISCRETION TO EVALUATE EACH CASE INDIVIDUALLY. TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ALTERNATE PLEA WOULD SERVE THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE. NOW HAVING- HAVING TROUBLE LIKE ALL THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AB SORRY ALL OF OUR CALIFORNIA I ACTUALLY WOULD GO TO ALL THE I'VE BEEN TO LIKE OVER TEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN IN CALIFORNIA TO NEGOTIATE CASES FROM MY NONCITIZEN CLIENTS AND WHAT I FOUND IS THAT EVEN IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE JURISDICTIONS WANT TO SERVE JUSTICE SO THEY THEY ARE THEY DO NOT WANT AN INDIVIDUAL- TO BE PERMANENTLY SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILY- AND- NOT YOU KNOW BE BANISHED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR LIFE BECAUSE OF A RELATIVELY MINOR DRUG CONVICTION. SO THIS REALLY IS A WIN WIN- IT WILL AVOID COSTLY TRIALS AND DRAGGED OUT COURT PROCEEDINGS- THE PROSECUTOR CAN OFFER THIS PLEA- WITHIN THE FIRST OR SECOND CALLING ON THE CASE. AND LASTLY. I JUST WANNA SAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT. OF BOTH JUSTICE AND IMMIGRATION REFORM WEREALLY ARE IN A IN A CRITICAL MOMENT AND WE NEED CALIFORNIA TO LEAD. THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO CURTAIL THE WORST REMNANTS OF THE WAR ON DRUGS- I REALLY WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER- JONES SAWYER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND FOR REALIZING AND SEEING THAT THIS IS A BROADER ISSUE THAN JUST IMMIGRATION DRUG CONSEQUENCES- THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF DRUG CONVICTIONS AFFECT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES SO I URGE EVERYONE HERE TO- VOTE IF I IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE.

THIS BILL DOES NOT CAP THE TIME LIMIT FROM ROOM CONFINEMENT USED IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS OR WHEN STAFF AND OTHER MINERS FACE SECURITY THREATS AS EVIDENCE IN THIS BILL RETAINING EXISTING STATUTES. AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY ONE MERELY SEEKS TO REMOVE AMBIGUITY AN EXISTING STATUTE THAT ALLOWS FOR MINORS TO BE LEFT IN A LOCKED ROOM WHEN NECESSARY FOR INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AN ATTORNEY GENERAL INVESTIGATION OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES FOUND INSTANCES OF MINORS BEING HELD IN ISOLATION WITHOUT DOCUMENTED BECAUSE FOR UPWARDS OF MULTIPLE DAYS. UNFORTUNATELY SUBSEQUENT REPORTS HAVE UNCOVERED SIMILAR ABUSE. AS RECENT AS FEBRUARY THIRD OF THIS YEAR A MINOR IN L. A. COUNTY CENTRAL JUVENILE HALL WAS UNNECESSARILY PLACED IN A ROOM CONFINEMENT. FOR ELEVEN DAYS UNDER THE PRETENSE OF MEDICAL ISOLATION. DESPITE STAFF BEING MADE AWARE OF THIS ERROR THE MINOR WAS STILL LEFT LOCKED IN A ROOM FOR NEARLY AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO HOURS. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE A FOLLOW UP INSPECTION MEANT TO ENSURE ABUSE IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED FIVE NEW CASES THAT VIOLATED THIS ROOM CONFINEMENT STATUTE TRIGGERING AN ADDITIONAL INSPECTION. YET L. A. COUNTY PROBATION STAFF ASSERTED THAT INSTANCES OF MINORS LOCKED IN ROOMS HAD NOT BEEN DOCUMENTED BECAUSE THEY FELL WITHIN THE EXEMPTED BRIEF PERIODS OF TIME. HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THE THEIR CLAIMS WOULD DETERMINE THAT MANY OF THESE INSTANCES COULD NOT BE CHARACTERIZED AS BRIEF PERIODS OF TIME NOR IS NECESSARY FOR INSTITUTIONAL OPERATION. CONSEQUENTLY VIOLATING EXISTING LAW. FURTHER WORSENING ABUSES MINORS IN THE HALLS HAVE SHARED HER EXPERIENCE OF HOARDING EMPTY MILK CARTONS AND EVEN STERILE GLOVES TO URINATE IN BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE A TOILET AND HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED OUT OF THEIR ROOM. SOME MINERS EVEN REPORTED HAVING TO USE THEIR TOWERS TO RELIEVE THEMSELVES WHICH IN TURN LEFT THEIR ROOM SMELLING OF COURT ORDER. MEMBERS REALLY LET'S BE FRANK.

I WORK I SANTIAGO SAN DIEGO ICE THEY ARE TO THEY ARE TAUGHT BY THAT MEASURE. THE. ONE HUNDRED. YEAH. GOOD TO HAVE A LOT. ONE BURKE BUT LAST ITEM- ITEM NUMBER TWENTY TWO EIGHTY FIVE SMITH. A PEACE OFFICER STOPS YOU MAY BEGIN MISTER SMITH ABLE TO MOVE THE MAIL FIVE. MISTER CHAIRED MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE IT IS PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY FIVE. THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LEGISLATION WAS PASSED THAT REQUIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO REPORT DATA ON ALL STOPS WHERE THE PEACE OFFICERS CONDUCTED A SEARCH OF A PERSON'S BODY OR PROPERTY. THERE SEVEN CATEGORIES OF DATA LOOTING THE PERSON'S PERCEIVED RACE GENDER AND AGE. THESE REPORTS THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WERE ENACTED TO AND ANALYZE WHY RICK RACIAL PROFILING OCCURS IN ALL ULTIMATELY TRY TO ELIMINATE THEM REQUIREMENTS TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME OF THE OFFICERS TIME DIMINISHING HOW MUCH TIME THEY CAN BE SPENT INTERACTING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND DOING PROACTIVE POLICING. THIS BILL WILL CLARIFY WHEN A PEACE OFFICER IS DISPATCHED TO A CALL FOR SERVICE OR MEDICAL EMERGENCY. THE PEACE OFFICERS NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM THESE REPORTING OBLIGATIONS. I BELIEVE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE ACTION CONSIDERING THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OFFICERS NOT INITIATING TO STOP. AND THEREFORE IS LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A BIAS TOWARD THE SUBJECT OF THE CALL OF SERVICE. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TIME IS USED EFFICIENTLY AND THEY'RE ABLE TO BE OUT IN OURCOMMUNITY TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN I DO HAVE SHARE OF DOCTORS AS MY WITNESS THANK YOU. OPERATE YOUR FERTILIZER CAN HEAR FROM THE SHARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. STOP THIS INITIATED BY A DISPATCHER CALL FOR SERVICE FOR A MEDICAL EMERGENCY BY DEFINITION IS NOT OFFICER INITIATED. THAT SUCH CONCERNS ABOUT RACIAL PROFILING OR IMPLICIT BIAS ARE NOT PARTICULAR TO THE OFFICER ANSWERING THE CALL. THE RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. OF EXISTING LAW ARE BURDENSOME RELIEVING LAW ENFORCEMENT OF THE DUTY TO DOCUMENT THIS INFORMATION WHEN THE STOP WAS NOT OPTION THIS YEAR IT MAKES SENSE AND WILL FREE OFFICERS TO DO MORE IMPORTANT DUTIES. IN SAMBAR DINO COUNTY. SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND AND EIGHTY OF THESE CALLS WERE HANDLED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS EQUATES TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS OF LOS SERVICE. TO OUR CITIZENS WHEN FILLING OUT THESE REFORMS RELATED TO THESE TYPES OF CALLS. BY REQUIRING OFFICERS TO REPORT WHAT IS PERCEIVED TO BE SOMEONE'S RACE ETHNICITY GENDER SIX CETERA. AB NINE FIFTY THREE IS ACTUALLY ASKING COPS THE PROFILE IT IS NOT PRUDENT THEREFORE TO MAKE CALLS FOR SERVICE AS PART OF RIVER REPORTING MY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL ARE SIMPLY RESPONDING TO A CALL FOR. ASSISTANCE THEY ARE NOT INITIATING IN CONTACT STOP FOR ASSISTANCE. IN ADDITION ANY STOPS MADE BY POLICE DURING A CALL FOR SERVICE OUR REGULAR PRECEDED BY DESCRIPTION GIVEN TO DISPATCH THEREFORE ANY REPORTING ON STOP RATES. FOR THESE TYPES OF STOCKS IS SKEWED IN ITS ANALYSIS OR COMPARISON. FOR THESE REASONS. I SUPPORT AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN EVERY QUESTION I RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WE GO TO ROOM ANY. MEMBERS OF PUBLIC. SUPPORT AS CHAIR MEMBERS CORY SAYS ONLY HALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. WE'LL GO TO THE PHONE LINES ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT. IF YOU'RE INTO PORT PLEASE PRESS AND ONE AND THEN ZERO. THERE'S NO ONE QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME. NOW GO TO OPPOSITION. AT ADDRESSING MARCO GEORGE MAKING HER WAY TO THE. PROTIUM. MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE OPPOSITION WE GOT OUR LETTER IN LATE AND I TRUST THAT THE MEMBER GOT IT- BASICALLY IF IT'S NOT BROKE DON'T FIX IT RIPA'S GOAL IS TO PROMOTE EQUAL JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS AND OUR POLICING SYSTEM AND TO IMPROVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE WAKE OF THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD IN MINNESOTA THE INITIAL NON PROSECUTION OF AMMAN HARBURY'S KILLERS AND GEORGIA. KEDAR THESE GOALS AND CREATING A UNIFORM SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING AND REPORTING BASIC INFORMATION ON HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT STOPS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH STOPS. A REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY WERE INITIATED- A. B. TWO TWO EIGHT FIVE SEEKS TO ELIMINATE EXCLUDED CALLS EXTENDED CALLS. SO AND EXCLUDING STOPS THAT RESULT FROM A CALL FOR SERVICE AB TWO TWO EIGHT FIVE WOULD UNDERMINE A DELIBERATE DECISION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE REP OF BOARD TO INCLUDE THE STOPS IN THE REGULATIONS. THE RIVER BOARD AND ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT SUCH A CAR PICKUP WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE AND ILL ADVISED FINDING THAT SUCH STOPS CONFORM TO THE DEFINITION OF STOCK AS DEFINED IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. TWELVE FIVE TWO TWO POINT FIVE. THE REGULATION WHICH INCLUDED EXTENDED CALLS ON WAS ACTUALLY- WENT THROUGH THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS IT WENT THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS AND EVERY EVERY STAGE OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS LAW ENFORCEMENT- A POST AT. BUT IT WAS APPROVED AFTER THE PUBLIC HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THE AGE SHE HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND THE REP OF BOARD MEMBERS WERE ALL HEARD FROM IF THEY SO DESIRED. THE INCLUSION OF CALLS FOR SERVICE AND THE DATA IS WORKING AND REVEALING. AS STATED IN THE MOST RECENT REFERE PORT CALLS FOR SERVICE ARE THE MOST COMMON WAY IN WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS INITIATE CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC. ANALYZING THESE INTERACTIONS CAN THUS BE USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIP. AND THE RIVER DATA HAS ALREADY ON. OPEN THE DOOR ON HARD TRUTHS THAT WERE LONG SUSPECTED FOR EXAMPLE THE PUBLIC POLICY OF INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA ANALYZED THE REP A DATA ON UP TO I BELIEVE HIGH- TWENTY TWENTY AND FOUND THAT BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE SEARCHED AS WHITE CALIFORNIANS SEARCHES OF BLACK CALIFORNIA'S LESS LIKELY TO YIELD CONTRABAND OR EVIDENCE AND SEARCHES OF WHITES BLACK INDIVIDUALS ARE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE BOOKED INTO JAIL. AS WHITES. THE RIVER BOARD EXAMINED THE DATA AND NOTED IN THERE- TWENTY TWENTY TWO REPORTED BELIEVE THAT OUR CALLS FOR SERVICE BLACK INDIVIDUALS WERE STOPPED. TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT. TIMES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN EXPECTED BASED ON THEIR PROPORTION OF THE RESIDENTIAL POPULATION MADE TWO HUNDRED AND FROM THE CALLS FOR SERVICE CHAU RESULTED AND STOPS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE TO SEE EXAMPLES OF WHITE INDIVIDUALS CALLING THE POLICE ON BLACK INDIVIDUALS- IN MY HOMETOWN THERE'S BEEN A BIG BARBECUE BECKY- AND CENTER IN NEW YORK THERE WAS CENTRAL PARK AMY AND CALLED THE POLICE. ON THE BIRD WATCHER. AND THEN THERE ARE THE EXAMPLES OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS WHO CALLED THE POLICE FOR SERVICES AND- WHEN I WAS WORKING AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER IN THE CITY OF ALAMEDA- I SAW. ON A BLACK SAILOR WHO CAME IN IN CUSTODY. IN HIS UNIFORM AND THE JUDGE SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND HE SAID WELL I WAS ROBBED AND I CALLED THE POLICE FOR HELP AND THEY ARRESTED ME FOR TRAFFIC COURT. MY EXPERIENCE IN ALAMEDA IS THAT A WHITE SAILORS IN A SIMILAR. SITUATION WHAT HAPPENED CITED. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY FIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU UNDER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION. WILL NOT GO TO EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HELLO YES WE HAVE LINE NINETY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. DILLON CALLING FROM ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION RESPECTIVELY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB TWO TWO EIGHT FIVE. THANK YOU IN NINETY NINE NINETY FIVE. HELLO THIS IS MELANIE- CHIRLA HI THIS IS MELANIE OSHA I AM ACTUALLY CURRENTLY THE CO CHAIR OF THE REPORT ALTHOUGH THE BOARD HAS NOT YET FORMALLY TAKE A POSITION ON THIS BILL I WANT TO VOICE MY STRONG OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU BRING ABOUT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RESPOND ON APRIL NINETEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN ALAMEDA MY CITY. WHERE I LIVE AND IN A PLACE WHERE I WALK ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY. A YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME OF MONEY- GONZALEZ. WAS KILLED AFTER ENGAGEMENTS WITH THAT WHAT CAME FROM A CALL FOR SERVICE- AT THE HANDS OF POLICE. HAVING ANY KIND OF SITUATION WHERE THE STATE. ISN'T TRYING TO COLLECT THE DATA OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT ALL% SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PEACE OFFICERS. I WOULD BE DOING A DISSERVICE. TWO PEOPLE TO FAMILY MEMBERS. TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS LOSE THEIR LIVES OR WHO HAVE AT. NEGATIVE THE FAX WHEN THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH OUR PEACE OFFICERS AND IT WOULD AND IT ERODES OUR ABILITY AS COMMUNITIES TO REALLY HAVE FULL FAITH AND TRUST IN OUR PEACE OFFICERS WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT. AND FOR THAT REASON I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THIS. BILL. YES I'D LIKE. O ASK A YES SIDE I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR POINT I. AND HERE'S THE REASON WHY SUPPORT THIS IS BECAUSE THE REASON FOR THIS DATA GATHERING IS TO FOCUS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT'S DISCRETION. AND WHEN YOU GET A CALL OVER THE RADIO. YOU HAVE NO DISCRETION. ALLOWED AND WHETHER YOU RESPOND TO THAT CALL FOR SERVICE. AND SO I THINK IT'S MISLEADING. WHEN WE QUITE. SOME OF THIS DATA THAT'S BEING GATHERED AS DISCRETIONARY- RESPONSE IT'S COMPLETELY MISLEADING AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR AND FOR THAT REASON I COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER COMMENTS MISTER CORK- I UNDERSTAND- MR LACKEY ARE CONCERNED. ARE ASKING THE SHARE- IS THERE ANY WAY TO DISTINGUISH THE SO THAT ONE CAN LOOK AT SEPARATELY I THINK ALL OF THE DATA SHOULD BE COLLECTED BUT PERHAPS MR LACKEY DOES HAVE A POINT- IN SOME CASES WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS POLICE. MAKING A DISCRETIONARY A STOP IN ANOTHER CASE EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE RACISM EXPOSED IT'S NOT THE POLICE OFFICERS FALL. HI MY I THINK WHAT THE MATTER IS BEFORE US TODAY IS NOT. I UNDERSTAND THAT PERHAPS IF IT DOESN'T PASS- WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT APPROACH THE IN LAWS LIKE WITH ANY BILL OF THE ARTICLE AFTER RECONSIDERATION WE ARE HAPPY TO BE DOING THAT A LOT. AND BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A YOU KNOW OF ISSUE- A WILLINGNESS FOR THE AUTHOR AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO KIND OF WORK THROUGH THAT. AND IT MAY BE SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON- YES I WOULD THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE. JUST TO CLARIFY IS. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING CALLED OUT FOR A CALL. I HAVE NO IDEA LOOK LIKE WAS MENTIONED I CAN'T SAY NOT A ONE GOAL THAT CALL. DIFFERENCE BEING PULLED OVER INTO UNDER REPORT TOTALLY WHOLLY AGREE FOR IT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. OKAY AND I THINK WE NEED TO COLLECT ALL DATA BECAUSE WE MAY FIND THERE IS RACISM EVEN IN THOSE CALLS THAT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. ON ITS FACE IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT IT COULD MAKE A BIG HUGE DIFFERENCE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ASSIST WITH A YOUNG AFRICAN LATINO WOMAN GETTING TO THE HOSPITAL. WITH AN AYE YOU PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO PARAMEDICS. ALL OF THAT COULD BE AT THAT. AND TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. OF WE MAY FIND YOUR RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID THAT IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW THAT LAST WEEK AGGREGATED INFORMATION. THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY HAVE BEEN ASTRONOVA. WE HAVE. ON AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER SITH THE MOTION IS DUE PATH JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY LACKEY I BONTA BONTA KNOW BRIAN.
