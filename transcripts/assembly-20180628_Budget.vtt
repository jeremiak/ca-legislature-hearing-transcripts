00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:37.260
ON WE ARE AND CONCERNED ABOUT

00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:39.329
SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IMPACTS

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:41.398
ON OF THE INITIATIVE ON THAT ARE

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:42.699
ALIGNED WITH THIS PARTICULAR

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:45.669
BILL ON STATE SPECIAL FUNDS.

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:47.704
AND I IN LIGHT OF THAT AS

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:49.840
PASSAGE OF THIS BILL A RESULTS

00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:51.174
IN THAT PARTICULAR INITIATIVE

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:52.642
BEING PULLED THE ADMINISTRATION

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:54.277
WILL SUPPORT.

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:56.346
I'M I WOULD KNOW THAT ON IN THE

00:51:56.413 --> 00:51:58.148
LA OWES INITIATIVE --

00:51:58.215 --> 00:52:00.217
FISCAL ANALYSIS THE NOTES THAT

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:02.118
THE INNOCENT INITIATIVES PASSAGE

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:03.153
WOULD BE AND WOULD HAVE

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.921
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LOCAL

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:06.623
GOVERNMENTS AND ALTHOUGH.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.058
IN THEIR ANALYSIS THEY SAY THE

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:10.794
IMPACT TO THE STATE IS MINOR.

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:12.562
I THINK ON BASED ON THE ALICE

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:13.997
PREVIOUS TESTIMONY IN THE SENATE

00:52:14.064 --> 00:52:15.131
THERE REALLY REVIEWING THAT IN

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.900
THE CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRETY OF

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.635
THE STATE BUDGET WHICH I HAVE

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.136
RIGHT NOW ON BASED ON HOW THE

00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:21.471
BUDGET THAT WAS SIGNED YESTERDAY

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:23.006
BY THE GOVERNOR'S AROUND TWO

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:24.441
HUNDRED AND ONE POINT FOUR

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:24.674
BILLION.

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:25.542
DOLLARS.

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:26.910
I WOULD OFFER TO TO THE

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.011
COMMITTEE ANOTHER WAY TO VIEW IT

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:29.412
THOUGH IS THROUGH THE PRISM OF

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:30.981
PROGRAMS.

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:32.983
AND I IF YOU LOOK AT NATURAL

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:35.051
RESOURCES AND THE ENVIRONMENT ON

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:36.653
THE PROVISIONS OF THE INITIATIVE

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.054
ON THOSE PARTICULAR SPECIAL

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:39.523
FUNDS WOULD BE DEVASTATING

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:40.524
BECAUSE MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.493
UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS --

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.196
FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND FOR

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:46.863
MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:47.497
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:49.833
US WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.268
ANY QUESTIONS I WOULD NOTE I'M

00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:54.070
AS THE CHAIR NOTED US THE OTHER

00:52:54.137 --> 00:52:55.372
MEASURE S. B..

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:56.006
EIGHT SEVENTY TWO A CONTAINS A

00:52:56.072 --> 00:52:58.241
CLARIFYING PROVISION ON THE

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:00.010
DEFINITION OF CANNABIS ON THAT

00:53:00.076 --> 00:53:01.378
WAS AN ISSUE THAT I UNDERSTAND

00:53:01.444 --> 00:53:02.646
THROUGH COMMITTEE STAFF WAS

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.414
RAISED BY SEVERAL --

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:06.516
LOCALITIES LEDGES AND ENSURES

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.351
THAT THE DEFINITION IS ITS

00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:10.787
BROADER BASED ON DIFFERENT CODE

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:13.189
SECTIONS THAT DEFINE CANNABIS.

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:14.190
THANK YOU MISS COST AND WE

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:15.792
ANTICIPATE GETTING --

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:19.229
AB EIGHT EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:20.497
FROM THE SENATE AND VOTING IT ON

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:21.831
THE FLOOR TODAY.

00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:23.633
BUT WE WILL NOT BE TAKING UP S.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:27.938
B. EIGHT SEVEN TWO INTEL MONDAY.

00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:29.940
ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM

00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:31.308
THE COMMITTEE MISTER STONE

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:31.608
[inaudible]

00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:33.310
BOB.

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:34.311
THANK YOU I AM I READING THROUGH

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:35.612
THIS AND I KNOW THIS WAS THE

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:38.081
DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK AND I

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:39.316
MEASURE IN QUESTION WOULD BE

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:41.585
DEVASTATING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:43.687
BUT I WONDER WHAT WE'RE DOING TO

00:53:43.753 --> 00:53:45.555
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HERE.

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:48.258
AS WELL ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.627
TRYING TO CREATE SALES OR TAXES

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:52.629
ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES AND

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:53.196
AND OTHERS ESPECIALLY GIVING

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:54.731
THAT.

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:55.799
THE SAUDIS THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:57.467
OUR POLITICAL DILEMMA.

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:59.102
I HAVE A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:01.071
THOUGH WITH THIS BILL AS A THAT

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:02.672
BADLY BURNED UNIFORM SALES LOCAL

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:05.175
SALES AND USE TAX WAS SET UP.

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:06.209
SO THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:07.644
DON'T HAVE TO CLICK TAXES THE

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:08.712
STATE THEN DOES THAT AND

00:54:08.778 --> 00:54:10.380
DISPERSES TO THEM.

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:13.483
AND SO IF A LOCAL JURISDICTION

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.985
ATTEMPTS TO DO SOMETHING

00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:17.654
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO A SODA

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:18.788
TAX WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:20.023
TALKING ABOUT WE WE DON'T ALLOW

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.525
SALES TAX ON GROCERIES OR OTHER

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:22.859
ITEMS ANYWAY.

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.694
SO IT.

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.196
SEEMS THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT I

00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:27.364
WOULDN'T EXPECT A LOCAL

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:28.965
JURISDICTION TO TRY AND TAX.

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:30.000
OTHER GROCERIES BUT THEY ARE

00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:31.601
TRYING TO GO AFTER SODAS.

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:35.038
BUT IF THEY DO OR IF THEY DO

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:36.439
SOMETHING THAT OFFENDS THIS

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:38.141
STATUTE.

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:41.011
THEN WE ARE BY THIS BY THIS BILL

00:54:41.077 --> 00:54:42.946
THEN ORDERING.

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:43.913
THE CALIFORNIA HARMONY TAX AND

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.615
FEE ADMINISTRATION TO CANCEL

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:47.817
THEIR CONTRACT FOR ALL OTHER

00:54:47.884 --> 00:54:49.552
COLLECTION AND AND SPUR SPENT OF

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.421
TAXES.

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:52.389
SO THEY OFFENDERS IN ONE LITTLE

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:53.723
AREA.

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:56.893
AND WE HIT THEM WITH A VERY VERY

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.129
VERY LARGE HAMMER AND LEAVE ALL

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:00.830
THE LOCAL TAXES COLLECTION AND

00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:02.265
DISBURSEMENT AT ALL THAT AND ALL

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:03.900
THE OTHER BENEFITS.

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:06.302
OF THE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM.

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:08.338
LOCAL SALES AND USE TAX LAW WE

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:11.574
JUST STRIP THAT AWAY FROM THEM --

00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:13.610
WHO REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THE

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:14.377
DRACONIAN NATURE OF THAT AS A

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:16.012
PENALTY?

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:18.048
CAN YOU TELL WHY THIS IS THE WAY

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:19.349
IT S..

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:20.550
I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THE

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:21.618
RATIONALE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:22.919
RIGHT THAT THERE IS A PROVISION

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:25.321
IN THE BILL THAT WOULD AND

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.923
BASICALLY DIRECT THAT DEPARTMENT

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.091
OF TAX ANTI ADMINISTRATION TO

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:30.160
CANCEL THEIR CONTRACT WITH

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:31.561
LOCALS FOR TAX COLLECTION.

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:33.229
ON AS A STATED PREVIOUSLY THIS

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.230
IS NOT AN ADMINISTRATION

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:35.865
PROPOSAL SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:36.966
RATIONALE BEHIND THIS PARTICULAR

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:38.401
PROVISION.

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:39.402
AND I HAVE A QUESTION THE

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:40.303
CONSTITUTIONALITY THAT

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:41.104
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE NEVER

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:41.738
CHARTER CITIES AND OTHERS WHO

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:44.340
HAVE SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL

00:55:44.407 --> 00:55:45.241
AUTHORITY TO DO THINGS IN THE

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:45.875
STATE.

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:48.712
HAS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO A

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:52.449
LOT WITH RESPECT TO TAXES BUT TO

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:53.049
CONFER A BENEFIT AND THEN TAKE

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:54.217
BACK.

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:59.222
A BENEFIT ESPECIALLY WHEN DUH.

00:55:59.289 --> 00:56:02.392
PUNISHMENT SEEMS TO FAR OUTWEIGH

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.760
THE POTENTIAL CRIME HERE I'D

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:06.496
JUST.

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:07.731
I THINK THIS SETS A VERY BAD

00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:09.232
PRECEDENT THAT.

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:09.766
I CAN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:13.269
QUESTION THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:15.538
MR CARTER.

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:16.673
AND YEAH I THINK I GOT

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.475
CLARIFICATION OF UP HERE BUT

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:19.743
JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THAT

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:21.544
JURISDICTION'S THAT.

00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:23.113
NEED TO REAUTHORIZE.

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:24.614
I THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE OF THE

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:25.982
CITIES WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO AS

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:27.217
FAR AS A NEW SORT OF TAX

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:27.517
[inaudible]

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:32.088
CORRECT.

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:36.092
NO YEAH THE IT ANY ARM.

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:39.162
IN THE TAX WAS IN PLACE PRIOR TO

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.764
JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:42.632
EIGHTEEN WOULD CONTINUE TO BE --

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:43.800
WHO EXIST AND COULD BE

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:46.102
REAUTHORIZED JUSTICE COULD BE

00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:47.103
INCREASED OR COULD HAVE HAVE A

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.838
NEW TAX CORRECT BUT IT COULD I

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:50.573
THINK OF ONE OF THE CITIES?

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.975
RICHMOND BERKELEY.

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:53.476
AS A SUNSET AND THEY COULD

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:55.645
REAUTHORIZE CORRECT.

00:56:55.712 --> 00:56:57.080
YES THE PROVISION STATES LOCAL

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:58.681
AGENCY MAY CONTINUE ELEVEN

00:56:58.748 --> 00:56:59.916
O'CLOCK ENFORCER REVIEW

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:01.851

SETUP ON GROCERIES IMPOSED

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:05.088
EXTENDED OR INCREASED.

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:07.957
ON OR BEFORE JANUARY FIRST

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:08.892
TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO TO THE DEGREE

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:11.895
LOCALITY HOT IN THE EXISTING TAX

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:14.164
IN THIS AREA ON IF THERE WAS A

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.832
SENSE THAT THEY COULD EXTEND --

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.333
PUT A VOTER ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.002
WITH THAT I THINK IS VERY VERY

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:20.436
CLEAR BY THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IS

00:57:20.503 --> 00:57:21.638
TO JUST LET READ THAT THEY WOULD

00:57:21.704 --> 00:57:23.139
HAVE.

00:57:23.206 --> 00:57:24.674
TO THEY WOULD HAVE TO EXTEND IT

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.009
PRIOR TO THAT DATE.

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:27.477
THAT EXTENSION DONE AFTER THAT

00:57:27.544 --> 00:57:28.077
DATE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED INTO

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:36.085
THIS TO THIS THAT YOU

00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:36.386
[inaudible]

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:38.855
YEAH.

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:40.123
THAT MISTER CHAIR.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:42.158
COULD WE HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:44.127
ON MISTER STONE'S QUESTION.

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.862
I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE AS I

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:47.363
READ THAT SECTION AND BASICALLY

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:48.798
GRANDFATHERS AND THE LOCALITIES

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:51.167
THE HOTLINE IN EXISTENCE PRIOR

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:53.169
AND ALLOWS THEM TO REAUTHORIZE.

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:54.537
YOU THINK TO MY COLLEAGUES --

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:57.407
PLANES REAUTHORIZE WOULD NOT

00:57:57.473 --> 00:57:59.909
INCLUDE INCREASING THAT --

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:02.011

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:45.722
TWENTY TWELVE THAT WOULD MEAN IF

SO GOOD AND I'M A SEVENTEEN YEAR

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:38.954
OLD AND I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.055
THE CITY ESTA.

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:41.657
DIABETES HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PART

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.425
OF MY LIFE AND HUNTING WAY I

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.560
REMEMBER BEING SIX YEARS OLD

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.395
SEEMING DRUM UP POKER STOMACH

HER DROPLETS FROM A FINGER.

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:49.698

DID IT OR WHAT SHE WAS DOING I

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:52.234

THE EFFECTS OF DIABETES.

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:55.003

AND THE REASON SHE DREW BLOOD

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.677
WAS TO MEASURE HER SUGAR LEVELS.

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.011
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS NEVER

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:04.747

PASSING A BILL SUCH AS THIS

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:27.335

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:56.351
CONCERNS POSITION ON THIS BILL

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:57.552
BECAUSE YOU RCOGNIZE THE

01:25:57.619 --> 01:25:58.987
DIFFICULT POSITION THAT WE'VE

01:25:59.053 --> 01:25:59.521
BEEN PLACED IN AS PART.

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:00.488
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:02.257
AND I THINK.

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:03.024
IN SOME OF THE ELOQUENT

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:04.359

YOU ARE READY WE RECOGNIZE THE

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:08.496
VALUE OF OF TAXES ON SODAS IN

PREVENTION ACTIVITIES.

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:15.537
BUT IT ALSO RAISES AWARENESS

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:16.971
ABOUT THE LINKAGE BETWEEN THE

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.540
SUGARY BEVERAGES AND CHRONIC

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.241
CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES AND

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:21.242
OBESITY.

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:22.710
AND IT ALSO --

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:23.978
HELPS TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION IN

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:25.880
THAT MANNER AND SO IT'S REALLY

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:27.348
DIFFICULT FOR US TO SEE THE

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:29.884
LOCAL ABILITY TO RAISE AND TAXES

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:31.419

DO RECOGNIZES THAT SHOULD THE

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:38.092
INITIATIVE GO THROUGH IT WOULD

01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:39.460
BE MUCH MORE DAMAGING TO LOCAL

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:40.662
GOVERNMENTS IN TERMS OF

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.096
RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO RAISE

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:43.665
AT TAXES AND FEES ON A WHOLE

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:44.699

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:52.774
THOSE REASONS AND WE JUST WANTED

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.608
TO STATE OUR CONCERNS WITH

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:54.676
APPROACH.
