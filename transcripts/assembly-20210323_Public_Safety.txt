I HAVE WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF BY PHONE DR PARVEEN PARMAR AN EXPERT WITH PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND YUNIS CHAU SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU NATIONAL PRISON PROJECT- WILL MAKE BRIEF PRESENTATIONS.

MODERATOR- ARE MR BONTA IS AB TWO SIX THREE. DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO SHOULD BE. YOU SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE WITNESS FROM THE SANDY ONE OF FROM THE DOCTOR PARVEEN PARMAR MD. AND UNITS THAT- FOR A YES I'M HERE HI OKAY. STATE YOUR NAME AND YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DR PARVEEN PARMER I AM AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL EMERGENCY MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S KECK SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF GLOBAL EMERGENCY MEDICINE. I AM ALSO% AN EXPERT WITH PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND THAT IS CO SPONSORING THIS BILL AS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS BRINGING MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO IMMIGRATION DETENTION POLICY AND PRACTICE. I PROVIDE ROUTINE CLINICAL CARE TO INCARCERATED PATIENTS AND A DEDICATED JAIL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT LOS ANGELES COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL. I ALSO CONDUCT RESEARCH FOCUSED ON THAT AND POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG INDIVIDUALS IN ICE DETENTION FACILITIES NATIONWIDE. THAT'S I'M ALSO FAMILIAR WITH ICE'S NATIONAL DETENTION STANDARDS AS THEY APPLY TO THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS IN ICE DETENTION. AS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC NINETEEN ON OUR COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I COME TO THIS COMMITTEE WITH A SINCERE HOPE TO MITIGATE FURTHER HARM AND DEATH IN OUR STATE FROM THE VIRUS AND IT'S MULTIPLE HEALTH RELATED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES. EIGHTY TWO SIX THREE IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION NEEDED TO HOLD PRIVATE PRISON CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEIR FACILITIES IMPACT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE ACTIONS AND OPERATIONS OF THESE PRIVATE ACTORS HAVE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. FOR PEOPLE HELD IN THEIR CUSTODY THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THESE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE IMMINENT THREAT POSED BY THE PANDEMIC. ATTRACTING PEOPLE IN CONGREGATE SETTINGS IS CRITICAL TO OUR STRUGGLE TO CONTAIN CODE NINETEEN. RESEARCH IN THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS ESTIMATED THAT NINETY OUT OF THE ONE HUNDRED LARGEST KOBE NINETEEN CLUSTER OUTBREAK HAD TAKEN PLACE AND CARCERAL SETTING LIKE DETENTION FACILITIES. THESE OUTBREAKS NOT ONLY THREATEN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO ARE DETAINED OR WORKING INSIDE THE FACILITIES THEY CAN QUICKLY OVERWHELM THE MEDICAL RESOURCES AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. AT THIS TIME THERE ARE AT LEAST SIX PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES AND OUR STATE WHICH CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITH LITTLE REGARD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH FOR EMPLOYEE SAFETY. DISTURBING REPORTS CONTINUE TO EMERGE THESE PRIVATE CORPORATIONS HAVE IGNORED REQUESTS BY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND IMPLEMENTED POLICIES THAT HARM HEALTH BY IGNORING WELL ESTABLISHED MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE WITH IMPUNITY. IN A PARTICULARLY CHILLING TESTIMONY EMANCIPATED OTAY MESA DETENTION CENTER OPERATED BY CORECIVIC REPORTED TO RESEARCHERS AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. THAT QUOTE THE DOCTOR WOULD NOT COMMENT UNTIL YOU WERE VERY VERY SICK ALMOST AT THAT DOOR AND CLOSE. HE ALSO STATED HE WAS MADE TO SIGN A DOCUMENT WAIVING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DETENTION CENTER IF YOU WERE TO GET SICK WITH KOBE NINETEEN. MY OWN EXPERIENCE EVALUATING HEALTH OUTCOMES IN ICE DETENTION FACILITIES HAS SHOWN ME THAT SUB STANDARD HEALTH CARE AND A LACK OF ATTENTION TO PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE IS A CONSISTENT AND LONGSTANDING PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR IN THESE PRIVATELY OPERATED ICE FACILITIES. THIS IS A PATTERN THAT WILL NOT CHANGE WITHOUT CLOSE OVERSIGHT AND REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES. AS A RESEARCHER. I INTERVIEWED THOUSANDS OF PAGES AND DETAILED DOCUMENTATION REGARDING THAT AND I DETENTION FACILITIES OVER THE PAST DECADE REPEATEDLY OUR RESEARCH CAME OUT LINKS DIRECT TO DELIVERY AND SUB STANDARD MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC CARE IN PRIVATE FACILITIES. THE FACILITY ROUTINELY VIOLATE I DID OWN HEALTH STANDARDS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE MINUTES LEFT YOU WILL LEAVE SOME TIME FOR MR. OR DID YOU READ. CERTAINLY I CAN WRAP UP- AT THE CORE OF THIS BILL IS A RECOGNITION THAT WE MUST EMPOWER LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS TO ACT DECISIVELY IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR STATE AND STARES OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC AND THAT'S WHAT AB TWO SIX THREE DOES THIS BILL CUTS THROUGH THE CONFUSION AND LACK OF CLARITY AND GET PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS A UNIFORMITY TO SECURE ALL THE TENSION FACILITIES UNDER UNIFIED STANDARDS. FOR THESE REASONS I ENCOURAGE YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CHAU ACLU. YES HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. GREAT HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS EUNICE CHOU AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU'S NATIONAL PRISON PROJECT WE WORK ON BEHALF OF IMMIGRANT DETAINEES FACING UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT. IN THE PAST YEAR I'VE SERVICE COUNSELING OVER FORTY CASES TEN OF WHICH A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF IMMIGRANT DETAINEES FACING THE THREAT A SERIOUS ILLNESS OR DEATH BECAUSE OF COVERED NINETEEN. I'M ALSO THE AUTHOR OF SEVERAL REPORTS REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF DETAIN PEOPLE IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES NATIONWIDE. AS PART OF THIS WORK FIVE VISITED DOZENS OF BILLS VISIBILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND INTERVIEWED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ABOUT CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT AND IMMIGRATION DETENTION. EIGHTY TWO SIXTY THREE IS AN ESSENTIAL LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION. IN THE LAST YEAR TWENTY ONE PEOPLE DIED IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SPENDING FIFTEEN YEARS. AND THOUSANDS MORE HAVE CONTRACTED CODED NINETEEN DUE TO THE FAILURE OF DETENTION OPERATORS TO ENSURE SAFE CONDITIONS IN DETENTION. CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO MORE WE HAVE SEEN REPEATED PATTERNS OF NEGLIGENCE AND MISCONDUCT BY PRIVATE DETENTION OPERATOR CALIFORNIA WHILE IMMIGRANT DETAINEES MIGHT BE IN THE LEGAL CUSTODY OF ICE. A FEDERAL AGENCY CALIFORNIA HAS CLEAR AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PEOPLE AND DETENTION FACILITIES INCLUDING THOSE HOUSING DEMOCRATS. STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS THE POWER TO REGULATE HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THESE PENSION FACILITIES INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE OPERATED OR OWNED BY PRIVATE PRISON CORPORATION. HOWEVER GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUE AND THE INVOLVING LEGAL LANDSCAPE IS QUITE COMMON FOR STATE AGENCIES TO LIMIT THEIR ABILITY OVER THE FACILITY. AND A PRIVATE OPERATORS. TWO EIGHTY TWO SIXTY THREE WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT PEOPLE IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN AMERICA TO THIRTY ANSWER ANY COMMUNITY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN FACILITIES OWNED AND OPERATED BY PRIVATE PRISON CORPORATIONS. OFTEN HAVE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO LOWER WAGES AND CUT CORNERS ON HEALTHCARE FOR DETAIN PEOPLE AN% OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY CARD FOR WORKERS. THIS IS TRUE AT THE- TEAMMATES SAID DETENTION FACILITY IN SAN DIEGO WHICH IS RUN BY CORECIVIC A PRIVATE PRISON CORPORATION. THE CAME INTO IS NOTABLE BECAUSE IT WAS THE SITE OF THE FIRST DETAINEE DEATH IN THE COUNTRY RESULTING FROM CORPORATE NINETEEN LAST YEAR. BUT IT'S ALSO A PLACE FOR CORECIVIC ORDERED MEDICALLY VULNERABLE GUARDS NOT TO WEAR MASKS I THINK THAT IT WOULD COST TO BE REMINDED HEANEY'S AND FAILED TO PROVIDE EVEN THE MOST BASIC. PP OR HIDING SUPPLY. SUPPORT STAFF AND THE TEAM. YOUR MOTHER PROTECT. EIGHTY TWO SIXTY WOULD MAKE. THAT OSHA REGULATES ARE ADEQUATE FOR THE ABILITY. COULD YOU PLEASE WRITE OUT A CHECK IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS. WE URGE YOU- AND SHE PASSED EIGHTY AT- THIRTY AT G.

AB TWO SIX THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY LACKEY I BARRICADE HAND BACK HE HAD A QUIRK. QUIRK HI SANTIAGO C. R. TWO C. R. TôI WICKES. WICKES HI LI LI HI THAT MEASURE. THAT MEASURE PASSES MR BONTA YOU MAY GO ON TO AB THREE TWO NINE BAIL. THANK YOU- AGAIN MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES AND STAFF AND THANK YOU FOR THE AYE VOTES IN THE LAST BILL I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AB THREE TWENTY NINE. IS A BILL TO FUNDAMENTALLY REFORM CALIFORNIA'S PRETRIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WERE HELD IN JAIL PRE TRIAL EVERY YEAR SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR. THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM PENALIZES POVERTY SETTING A PRICE ON A PERSON'S ACCESS TO PRE TRIAL RELEASE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THEIR WALLET NOT THE SIZE OF THEIR RISK ON ANY GIVEN DAY IN CALIFORNIA 63% OR ROUGHLY FORTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE STATE'S JAILS ARE AWAITING TRIAL OR SENTENCING. AND 97% OF THEM. MAKE BAIL WHO MAKE BAIL YOU THE BAIL AGENT TO SECURE THEIR RELEASE THIS MEANS THAT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ACCUSED OF CRIMES AND UP PAYING A FEE. TO STAY OUT OF JAIL BEFORE EVER BEING FOUND GUILTY BY A JUDGE. OR BY JURY. IT IS A BROKEN SYSTEM. THAT DOES NOT MAKE US SAFER OR LOWERED INSTANCES OF FAILURES TO APPEAR IN COURT. IN MY VIEW IT IS UNFAIR UNJUST AND UNSAFE. LAST APRIL IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE OVERCROWDING IN JAILS AND POTENTIAL. PROFIT NINETEEN OUTBREAK THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ENACTED AN EMERGENCY ZERO BAIL ORDER. THAT DEMONSTRATES A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO KEEPING. PEOPLE IN JAIL PRE TRIAL. AFTER THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DISCONTINUED THEIR EMERGENCY BAIL SCHEDULE THIRTY ONE COUNTIES COVERING 80% OF CALIFORNIANS. ENACTED THEIR OWN. EMERGENCY ZERO BAIL SCHEDULES AB THREE TWENTY NINE. BILLS ON THE BURTON C. BELL SCHEDULE SET BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. TO BUILD A MORE EFFECTIVE AND A MORE JUSTICE SYSTEMS. THE BILL REFORMS MONEY BAIL NOT BY ELIMINATING IT BUT RATHER SETTING BAIL AT ZERO DOLLARS FOR MISDEMEANOR. AND NONVIOLENT FELONY. CHARGES FOR ALL OTHER. CRIMES THE NEW LEGISLATION WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO CREATE A UNIFORM. BELL SCHEDULE WITH STANDARD BAIL AMOUNTS STATEWIDE. SO THEY'LL BE CERTAIN C. AND CONSISTENCY AMONG OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AB THREE TWENTY NINE WOULD ALSO REQUIRE PEOPLE WHO PAY BILL TO RECEIVE A REFUND. MINUS A SMALL SURCHARGE THAT IS RETAINED BY THE BILL ON COMPANIES. IF THE CHARGES ARE NEVER. IF CHARGES AGAINST THE ARE DRAW. OR IF IT TEN ALL MANNED COURT APPEARANCES MEANING THEY APPEAR AT ALL TIMES AND THEY'RE REQUIRED. CURRENTLY BILL COMPANIES HAVE BUILT AN IMMENSELY PROFITABLE INDUSTRY. THROUGH THE CURRENT SYSTEM CLICKING HIGH FEES USUALLY ON AVERAGE 10% OF THE FULL BELUM OUT. THE AVERAGE WILL NOT CALIFORNIA 5000010% IS FIVE THOUSAND. WELL RARELY FORFEITING BONDS POSTED TO THE COURT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A CASE IS DISMISSED OR IF CHARGES ARE NOT ULTIMATELY FILED OR IF. THEY'RE DROPPED. THE BILL COMPANY KEEPS ITS PREMIUM. INDIVIDUALS PAY THESE PREMIUMS BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS WORSE. BEEN STUCK IN JAIL TO ME LOSING A JOB. LOSING A CAR LOSING A HOME LOSING A FAMILY MEMBER. IF THEY AREN'T- IF THEY HAVE CUSTODY OF A SMALL CHILD NO THE ONLY A PARENT WHO CAN DO THAT. THE JAIL HOUSE DOOR SHOULD NOT SWINGS OPEN AND CLOSE BASED ON HOW MUCH MONEY SOMEONE HAS. THERE IS NO DISPUTING THE PRESENT SYSTEM WRONGLY TREAT PEOPLE WHO ARE RICH. AND GUILTY. BETTER THAN THOSE WHO ARE POOR AND INNOCENT. IN MY VIEW THE STATUS QUO IS INDEFENSIBLE AND WE CANNOT DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE. IT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. MONEY BAIL APPEAR IN MY EYES IS AN EQUAL JUSTICE. AND WE MUST CONTINUE OUR FIGHT FOR EQUAL JUSTICE. UNDER THE LAW. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE ON AB THREE TWENTY NINE SO WE CAN CREATE A FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA THAT EMBRACES SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. THE FEATURE THAT ELIMINATES BLATANT DISCRIMINATION. AGAINST THE POOR AND MAKES US SAFER. THANK YOU. I HAVE A AS A WITNESS ESTEBAN UNIONS REPRESENTING TO ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES IS MR NUNEZ ON THE PHONE AND. YES SIR AND YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. OKAY MEMBERS OF THE. OKAY I'M NOT A BIG MUCH OF THE TIME I WON'T USE ALL THE FIVE MINUTES- BUT ADDS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA SAID MY NAME IS AS BY NEW YEAR'S I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION ALSO KNOWN AS A R. C. A. R. HE WORKS TO END MASS INCARCERATION CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE HEALTHY AND WHOLE THEIR SKIN POWERS FORMERLY AND CURRENTLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO DRIVE BY PROVIDING A SUPPORT NETWORK COMPREHENSIVE REENTRY SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVOCATE FOR POLICY CHANGE. THERE ARE GRASSROOTS POLICY ADVOCACY WE ARE DEDICATED TO TRANSFORMING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THAT IT IS MORE JUST EQUITABLE FOR ALL PEOPLE. HE HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO REFORM CALIFORNIA'S PRE TRIAL SYSTEM PREMIERED NEARLY FIVE YEARS NOW BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN EQUITY FAIRNESS ACCOUNTABILITY AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE I WANT TO GROUND UP IN A STORY BEEN ERRORS YOU MEMBER. WHO SADLY IT'S UNABLE TO BE WITH US TODAY. RIGHT THE KOBE BAD RAP THANK. IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR. BELL SCHEDULE FOR PEOPLE BEING CHARGED WITH LOWER LEVEL OFFENSES ENACTED MEMBER WHO HAD BEEN INTERNALLY STRUGGLING. WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH VANDALISM. HIS BAIL WAS SET WELL BEYOND THE MEANS OF WHAT HE COULD AFFORD AND TRUTH BE TOLD THIS YOUNG MAN WAS IN DIRE NEED OF HELP AND SUPPORT SERVICES. NOT COUNTY JAIL. A WEEK LATER HE WAS MURDERED IN COUNTY JAILS. WHAT HE REALLY NEEDED WAS WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT BACKED OF A R. C. OFTENTIMES LOW LEVEL OFFENSES ARE CRIMES OF DESPERATION AND OUTRIGHT YOU WILL. NOT ONE THAT SIGNALS THE FUTURE OF LIFE OF CRIME THE ONE THAT SIGNALS THAT THEIR VERY BASIC NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET. COUNTY JAIL CANNOT ONLY BE TRAUMATIZING BUT EXACERBATES UNDERLYING TRAUMAS IN CONDITIONS IT'S NOT A PLACE OF HEALING REHABILITATION OR MATURATION. HOW DID YOU KNOW THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE QUICKLY STRIPPED OF YOUR DIGNITY AND CONTRACTS. IT'S A NATURAL THE PROJECT THRILLED WITH DESPAIR AND STEER. CLEAR OF WHAT LIES AHEAD. YOUR EMPLOYER WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVEN'T SHOWED UP TO WORK HERE YOUR CHILDREN WILL END UP IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU ARE N JAIL. HERE THAT YOU MAY BE FORCED INTO A PLEA BARGAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED STOCKYARD AGAINST YOU OR WORSE. DEATH ROBEL ORDER TEMPERED. ALTHOUGH IT AND WANTED EFFECT FROM APRIL TO JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY UNDER THIS ORDER WE DID SEE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION COUNTY JAIL POPULATION ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND WE SAW NO REAL SPIKE IN CRIMES FOR THOSE OFFENSES WHICH WERE ZERO BELL ELIGIBLE. YES FIFTY DATA SHOWS A STATEWIDE DECREASE OF 30% AND COUNTY JAIL POPULATIONS BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA'S BELL SCHEDULE WAS ELECTED IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY I'VE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA SAID THIRTY ONE COUNTIES WHICH ACCOUNT FOR CLOSE 280% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION KEPT INFORMED ZERO BELL SCHEDULE IN PLACE. WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT IF THEY KNEW THEY WERE IN A BURDEN IMPACTS OF OBSCENE SPIKES IN CRIME FOR THE WORK. A REPORT PUBLISHED LAST OCTOBER BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA PROVED THAT THERE WAS NO MAJOR SPIKE IN CRIME FOR THOSE OFFENSES WHICH ARE YOUR ABOUT ELIGIBLE. FOR THE MORNING ANALYSIS BY KTVU WHICH ANALYZED FIVE AREA COUNTIES ALAMEDA SAN FRANCISCO CONTRA COSTA EMETERIO IN SANTA CLARA FOUND THAT. IN THE TIME CALIFORNIA HAD INSTITUTED A ZERO BILL POLICY. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 3212% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALLOWED TO BAIL OUT FOR FREE WERE REARRESTED. DURING ROUGHLY A ONE TO TWO MONTH PERIOD WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN CALIFORNIA'S RECIDIVISM RATE AND EVEN CONNECTION RIGHT. THE PRETRIAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE REPORTS THAT THE COST OF SUPERVISING A PERSON IN THE COMMUNITY LOS. WHAT HAD BEEN A TRIAL IS 10% THAT OF THE COST OF KEEPING THAT PERSON IN JAIL. WHAT DATA THAT. WOULD DATA SHOWING THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE RELEASED PRE TRIAL DO NOT RE OFFEND AND THAT VERY LITTLE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THEY SHOW UP TO COURT ON TIME. THESE COSTS BOTH HUMAN AND FINANCIAL. I JUST JUSTIFIABLE. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT WE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION ALONG WITH OUR PARKERS SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS URGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB.

BESSEMER I GUESS YOU'RE HAVE TO GO FIRST AND HOPEFULLY MISTER MORE PSYCHED UP FOR GOING. HOPEFULLY FEINSTEIN NINE- COUPLE MINUTES. OKAY BONNEVAL CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON EIGHTY THREE TWENTY NINE- PRIVATE FOOD UNITED ALTHOUGH OF FACTORY THE MEMBERS ABOUT THE SPORT DOES RESPECTIVELY OPPOSED DE UM. THE BILL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. PRIVATE DID UNITED IS AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF THOUGHTFUL OF WEALTH THAT A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM HOWEVER EIGHTY SIX TWO SIX TWO I'M SORRY BETWEEN TWENTY NINE IS NOT THAT. IT IS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT IN IT IN THE BACK FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN MANY WAYS AND A PARTICULAR IMPACTS THE VICTIMS OF CRIME. HE THERE IS NO PROVISION IN THIS BILL PROVIDES FOR THE VOICE THAT PICKED UP AND SPECIFICALLY AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. ARTICLE TWENTY EIGHT DATA PROVIDES TO THE VICTIM CAN BE HEARD AT A BAIL SENTENCING SO THAT THEIR SAFETY IN PARTICULAR CAN BE CONSIDERED ONE COMPANIES RELEASED THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT PROVIDES THAT. SECONDLY WHAT GIVES ME CONCERN- AND GIVE THE VICTIMS OF CRIME CONCERNS ON AB THREE TWENTY NINE IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS TARGETING BUT- BOTH LOCAL OFFENDERS WILL INCLUDED IN THAT OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS HATE CRIME OFFENDERS CHILD ABUSE OFFENDERS AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND THESE VICTIMS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION THAT WILL BE AFFECTED BY PEOPLE BEING RELEASED WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MATHIS FUTURES I THINK THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMISSION- KNOW VERY WELL THAT THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME FOR A VICTIM IS WHEN. HE OR SHE ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE THEIR ABUSERS AND TO HAVE SOMEBODY RELEASED WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY TO PLACE THEM IN- GREAT VIOLENCE AND AGAIN NOT. BEING ABLE TO BE HEARD BEFORE THEY RELEASE IT IS CRITICAL TO THE SAFETY AND THE PUBLIC. SAFETY- I UNDERSTAND THAT. ABOUT INCARCERATING PEOPLE PAYING TO GET A I HAVE RESPECT FOR THE- SITE WE ARE WE TO WORK TOWARDS THAT IN FACT WE ARE WORKING WITH A SUPPLEMENT COOPER WHO HAS A BILL THAT ADDRESSES THOSE ISSUES THAT I BELIEVE IS MUCH MORE THAT IS A WELL THOUGHT. OUT IN THE REALM OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND I WOULD URGE THE MEMBERS TO CONSIDER THAT AND CONSIDER THAT WE NEED TO FIND. A REMEDY THAT NOT ONLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO TRUST BUT ALSO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE VICTIMS. AND LASTLY I WOULD URGE YOU TO ALSO LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND VOTERS- JUST TO NOTE THAT FOR WE HAD. AN ISSUE DID. THAT TRY TO- AS EFFECTIVELY AWAY. CAL AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S ISSUES THAT THE WITH ARGUMENTS WILL THAT WAS BASED ON THE SYSTEM SMALL FROM THE VICTIM PERSPECTIVE. WHO WAS A STRONG- UP AGAINST THAT INITIATIVE CAME OUT STRONG AND FINISH IT UP MANY CRAP. DAY AGAIN FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT ARE BRINGING. FORTH THAT THERE WAS NO PROTECTIONS FOR OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS NO BALANCE IN THE SYSTEM. I AGREED THAT THE BILL SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY CRIME VICTIM THAT DOESN'T AGREE THAT THE BAIL SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE INCARCERATED. JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A MONETARY NEEDS. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE CAN JUST LET THEM OUT WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THE VICTIM'S SAFETY. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS AGAIN I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT MEMBERS TO LOOK AT ASSEMBLY COOPER'S BILL AB THIRTY EIGHT- AS AN ALTERNATIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND IT'S MISS SO. SOLANO GOVERNMENT ALARM. NOW SULUR YES. THANK YOU FOR TIME AND I THINK I I'M SORRY VOICE IS KIND OF SCRATCH. THE SURFACE IT'S MINE JOB SO. MISTER MORRIS IF YOU SEE ARE THERE. THE NUMBER IF YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING IN IS NINE ONE SIX THREE ONE NINE. THREE SEVEN FOUR FOUR NINE ONE SIX. THREE ONE NINE A THREE SEVEN FOUR FOUR THEY'RE SHOWING YOU THERE BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING. YOU TALK TO STAFF RIGHT NOW SO HOPEFULLY AS WE GO THROUGH SOME OF THE ME TOOS THAT OPPOSE THE BILL MAYBE YOU CAN COME IN. RIGHT AFTER THAT SO THE ME TOOS. THERE ARE IN OPPOSITION OF A AB. THREE TWO NINE. AT&amp;T OPERATOR. LARRY MOORE IS IN THAT THE RUMOR ONLINE HE CAN DO STARZ ZERO AND WE CAN GET HIS NAME AND FIND HIS LINE IF HE'S IN THERE SO THAT WOULD BE START THERE ALL. HE'S ALREADY IN THERE. ARE WE ARE LOOKING FOR OPPOSITION OF AB AND THREE TWENTY NINE PLUS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND WE DO HAVE SOME QUEUING UP HERE. MAY I BEGIN AT EIGHTY THREE TWENTY NINE OPPOSITIONIST REPAIRMAN MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS IS LARRY MORRIS. NUMBER EIGHT YES LEARN MORE YEAH I CAN HEAR YOU CAN. WHAT HE- I. WHAT ARE YOU ARE YOU IN ON YOUR PHONE AND YOU CAN OR YOU TO TURN DOWN WE'RE GETTING SOME FEEDBACK. NOW WE HAVE NOTHING IN. HOW ABOUT NOW MISS ALL RIGHT THE AGO. YOU MAY BE GALA ABOUT. YES BEGIN I'M SORRY TO BE SUCH A PAIN TECHNOLOGY IS A WONDERFUL- THIS IS LAURIE MORE SOME BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY TWO WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THAT BAIL IN MOST CRIMINAL OFFENSES TO. BE SET AT ZERO AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA NO DOUBT RECALLS FROM HIS APPEARANCE AT THE CDA CONFERENCE A FEW YEARS AGO ON THE BAIL REFORM BILLS THAT HE AND SENATOR HERTZBERG WERE PURSUING CALIFORNIA'S ELECTED DA'S RECOGNIZE AND EMBRACE THE NEED FOR A BOTTLE BAIL REPORT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA KNOWS CDA DID NOT OPPOSE THOSE BILLS NOR DID IT OPPOSE PROPOSITION TWENTY FIVE LAST NOVEMBER THIS YEAR CDAC- IS SUPPORTING CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER IS BILL AB THIRTEEN FORTY SEVEN THAT WOULD PUT AN END. TO THE UNFAIR PRACTICE OF CHARGING YEARLY BAIL RENEWAL PREMIUMS WE MUST HOWEVER OPPOSE AB THREE TWENTY NINE BECAUSE IN OUR VIEW IT DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR THREATS TO PUBLIC SFETY THAT WOULD LARGELY REMOVE THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT TO SET BAIL AS APPROPRIATE TO THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF A GIVEN CRIME. AND HIS SHE CHARGED CDA BELIEVES THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON BECAUSE GOAL TO CREATE A FAIRER AND MORE EQUITABLE BAIL SYSTEM WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO BALANCE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED WITH PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY. UNFORTUNATELY SB TWO SIXTY TWO REQUIRES THE COURT SET BAIL AT ZERO FOR A WIDE RANGE OF CRIMINAL CHARGES AND CIRCUMSTANCES THE PRESENT AN UNACCEPTABLE RISK TO THE COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE THE COURT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO IMPOSE ZERO BAIL ON MOST HATE CRIMES AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE PAINFULLY AWARE OF THEIR INCREASING FREQUENCY AND MATHIS. ZERO BAIL ALSO WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR SUCH CRIMES IS WHAT THIS INTIMIDATION AND FELONY POSSESSION OF A WEAPON. THE BILL ALSO DRAWS ARBITRARY USING DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ALLEGED CRIMINAL CONDUCT FOR EXAMPLE A PERSON CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO BAIL THAT SAME PERSON HOWEVER IF CHARGED WITH SOME TYPES OF FELONY ELDER ABUSE OR CHILD ABUSE. WITH A COLD BREW AVAIL. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A ZERO HERE LAST YEAR TO ME THE- OF NINE. X. OF JAIL. WAS SPECIFICALLY TO ON ABILITY OF THE COURT TO SET BAIL WHEN APPROPRIATE. INEXPLICABLY THAT LANGUAGE BESTING DISCRETION WITH JUDGES OUT OF THIS BILL. THERE IS NOTHING UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT PREVENTS THE COURT FROM RELEASING AN ACCUSED ON HIS OR HER OWN REQUIREMENTS FOR SETTING BAIL. AND AS A PROSECUTOR FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS I SAW IT HAPPEN REGULARLY. JUDGES FREQUENTLY EXERCISED THIS PREROGATIVE TO MAINTAIN FOR THE PARK FROM SCHEDULED BAIL AFTER PUBLIC PROSECUTORS AND THE DEFENSE. CDA IS SUPPORTING ASSEMBLYMAN COOPER'S AB THIRTY EIGHT BAIL REFORM BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A STATEWIDE BAIL SCHEDULE. TO BE DETERMINED BY A GROUP OF JUDGES SELECTED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION CDA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. STATEWIDE BAIL SCHEDULE WOULD BE REVISED ANNUALLY AND WOULD INCLUDE PUBLIC INPUT. THIS APPROACHING BETTER TAILORED TO ACHIEVING UNIFORMITY AND FAIRNESS ONE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. A PERSON CHARGED WITH A CRIME SHOULD NEVER REMAIN IN CUSTODY SOLELY BECAUSE HE OR SHE IS POOR. CDA SUPPORTS THE CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REFORM OUR BAIL SYSTEM HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE AB THREE TWO NINE IS THE BEST BE A CALL FOR ACHIEVING. THAT GOAL AND RESPECT WAS. THANK YOU MISTER MOORE. NOW EIGHTEEN T. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION. AB THREE TWO NINE WILL. YEP APR OPPOSITION OF AB THREE TWO NINE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AND WE DO HAVE ONE ONE THIRTY SIX PEOPLE HAD. YES THANK YOU HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS PAUL BAUER ON BEHALF OF ALL PRO BAIL BONDS. IN OPPOSITION TO AB THREE TWENTY. THANK YOU. AND OUR NEXT LINE IS ONE SEVENTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SYDNEY HOFF WITH RESOLUTE ON BEHALF OF THAT CALIFORNIA BAIL AGENTS ASSOCIATION WHERE OPPOSED OVER THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE CELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE NEXT LINE IS EIGHTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS THE COMMITTEE THIS IS JEFF CLAYTON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN BAIL COALITION HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ONE OF THE ONE FIFTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY SAYS L. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION MAYBE THREE TWENTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IN OUR NEXT LINE OF THE ONE OF SEVENTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE CAPPY WENCH REPRESENTING THE GOLDEN STATE BAIL AGENTS ASSOCIATION JAPAN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND OUR FINAL OPPOSITION IN THE QUEUE IS ONE SIXTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO THE GROUND PRINT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY CAN WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE OPPOSITION HM. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR LACKEY FIRST IN AND- YES WORK THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA WHY WOULD IS THERE NO RISK ASSESSMENT ELEMENT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. MISTER LUCKY THIS IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN SB TEN- ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FIVE SB TEN AND PROP TWENTY FIVE PROPOSED TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE MONEY BAIL AND REPLACE IT WITH WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL AS WELL AS THE BEAUTIFUL DISCRETION AND- SETTING BAIL- THIS IS BUILDING OFF SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HAD IN PLACE DURING THE PANDEMIC- AS WELL AS APPROACH IS THAT HAVE OCCURRED SUCCESSFULLY IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS LIKE NEW YORK NEW JERSEY- KENTUCKY WHERE THERE WAS- ZERO BAIL OR SITE RELEASE THAT DIDN'T RELY ON BAIL. FIVE WHICH LED TO MANY MORE PEOPLE BE SAFELY RELEASED CRIME RATE TO THE WENT DOWN OR HELD STEADY- APPEARANCE RATES HELD STRONG- RE OFFENSE- RATES I DIDN'T DIDN'T MOVE SO WE THINK IT'S AN APPROACH THAT CAN LEAD TO MANY MORE PEOPLE BEING SAFELY AND FAIRLY RELEASED WITHOUT- THREATENING PUBLIC SAFETY SO IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT APPROACH I GUESS IS THE SHORT ANSWER- TO YOUR QUESTION AND- IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SB TEN- MONEY BAIL CONTINUES TO EXIST. WITH THIS UP PROPOSAL TODAY- WITH AB THREE TO THREE TWENTY NINE BUT IT DOES HAVE COMPONENTS OF ZERO BALANCE ACCOUNTABILITY- CONSIDERATION OF THE ABILITY. TO PASS AS SET FORTH IN THE BILL. OKAY WILL REGRETTABLY I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. AS IT STANDS CURRENTLY I ALSO BELIEVE IT'S IN DIRECT CONTRAST TO THE- EXPRESSED WILL OF THE PEOPLE- BY PROPOSITION TWENTY FIVE IN THE LAST ELECTION SO- THAT'S TOTAL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS. THANK YOU MR QUIRK. YES ARAMBULA BY WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I DO THINK IT NEEDS SOME WORK- AND IN LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. THE FACT THAT IT I DO THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO ALLOW JUDGES SOME DISCRETION- IN- THERE MAY BE PEOPLE OF COMMITTED SOME OF THESE LESS VIOLENT CRIMES. WHO THEY FEEL NEED TO PAY BAIL OR PERHAPS THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF NOT SHOWING UP. WHATEVER IT IS I DO THINK WE NEED THAT DISCRETION IF IT'S NOT IN THE BILL- SECOND I AM CONCERNED THAT. THE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE TO PAY BAIL MAY NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO BAILS BONDSMEN. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS SINCE YOU REQUIRE THAT THE MONEY ESSENTIALLY BE GIVEN 95% OF IT BE GIVEN BACK I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL BE IN THE BAIL BOND BUSINESS. AND LAST WEEK WE- SET BAIL AT A MUCH LOWER AMOUNT WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD SOLUTION MAYBE 10% OF WHAT THEY TYPICALLY IS TODAY FIVE THOUSAND INSTEAD OF FIFTY. THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH TO GET PEOPLE TO SHOW UP. SO IF WE WERE TO REACH RESET THE SYSTEM. I'D BE IN FAVOR OF JUST BRINGING EVERYTHING DOWN 90% I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BETTER APPROACH- FOR THE POPLE THAT YOU'RE YOU DO NEED TO KEEP IN JAIL AND AGAIN A JUDGE CAN ALWAYS SAY. WE WILL NOT ALLOW BAILIN THIS CASE SO THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS AS A AND NO NO GOOD BILL GOES UNCHANGED ISSUE. SO JUST THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR BONTA. I THANK THANK YOU SOMEBODY CALLED MEMBER QUICKER OF. REBEKAH BACK K. AND HAS A QUESTION DID YOU WANT TO ASK I DID YEAH THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR OTHERS WHO ARE ASKING QUESTIONS ALONG SIMILAR LINES BUT JUST WANT TO THANK SOMEONE FOR CORPORATES ALWAYS THOUGHTFUL INPUT. I DO WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A POPULATION THAT IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF ANYTHING. AT THIS STAGE IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND WE BELIEVE THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL CONFLICTS WITH. ARTICLE ONE SECTION TWENTY EIGHT OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH DOES GIVE JUDGES TIME MR COURTS POINT DISCRETION TO DETAIN PRE TRIAL- WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SO IF THAT IS NOT CLEAR TO THE OPPOSITION- WE WILL SEEK TO MAKE THAT CLEAR- AND WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF THE BILL WHICH SEEKS TO HAVE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. SET A UNIFORMED BELL SCHEDULE PERHAPS IT WILL BE 90% LESS THAN THE CURRENT BILL NUMBERS- I THINK THEY WILL CERTAINLY AKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE FACT THAT WE ARE THE HIGHEST IT HAS BILLS SCHEDULED IN THE NATION- WENT WHEN SETTING THAT AND WE DO HAVE A COMPUTER IN THE BILL. WHICH WILL AWAIT THAT THE- GUIDANCE OF THE HUMPHRIES CASE WHICH SHOULD BE COMING DOWN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. WHICH PROPOSES TO ALLOW FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THE ABILITY TO PAY BAIL- BY INDIVIDUALS NOT FIXING THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS K. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I THIS IS AND IMPORTANT AND EFFORT AND CONVERSATION AND I WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THAT EVERYONE THE OPPOSITION INCLUDED AGREES THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE ONE REMAINS INCARCERATED MERELY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY AND THEIR POOR IS A BROKEN SYSTEM. AND ONE THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BE FIXED BECAUSE THE QUESTION BEFORE ANY COURT WHEN DECIDING WHO SHOULD BE HELD WHEN INNOCENT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING FREE TRIAL SHOULD BE WHO IS A REST OUR COMMUNITY NOT WHO CAN PAY AND THE FACT THAT. IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS LED OUT WHO WASN'T RISK BECAUSE HE HAD THE MEANS TO PAY FOR IT AND THAT THAT TOO IS A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO BE A HOLDING THOSE WHO POSE A RISK AND ALLOWING THOSE WHO DO NOT POSE A RISK TO OUR COMMUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND TO KEEP THEIR JOB AND KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF BEING INCARCERATED BEFORE YOUR TRIAL IN BEFORE YOU'VE BEEN FOUND GUILTY AND THEN UNTIL THAT HAPPENS ONE SHOULD BE ABLE IF THEY'RE NOT A RISK TO SOCIETY TO MAINTAIN THAT- THOSE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE. THAT BEING SAID I SHARE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION- AND OF MY COLLEAGUE. THAT THIS BILL'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE ANY. RISK ASSESSMENT OR JUDICIAL DISCRETION LEAVES US OPEN TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DO POSE A RISK TO OUR COMMUNITIES BEING LED OUT AND I GUESS I DO READ IT DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU DO I DON'T BELIEVE IT- MAINTAINS THE DISCUSSION HELD UNDER THE CONSTITUTION I READ THE BILL TO REQUIRE COURTS FOR THOSE CHARGED WITH THESE OFFENSES TO LET THEM OUT OF ZERO BALANCE NOT THE CONCERN OF MINE SO IF YOU DO CLARIFY THAT THAT'S- I THINK. A GOOD AMENDMENT THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE TAKEN IN THE FUTURE BUT I'M GLAD THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL BILLS MOVING IN THIS SPACE I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I LOOK FORWARD TO A BILL THAT I THINK STRIKS THAT BALANCE OF ENSURING THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITY AND NOT INCARCERATING PEOPLE FOR BEING INDIGENT- BUT I CAN'T AT THIS POINT- SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT YET STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE IN PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. COMMENTED INPUT. SENILE YOU MAY CLOSE RESTAURANT WELL I JUST THANK YOU FOR THAT THE ACTIVE LISTENING AND THE VERY HELPFUL COMMENTS SO THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE THE FIRST HOUSE I WILL DEFINITELY TAKE A CONSIDERATION YOUR YOUR ADVICE COUNSEL AND INSIGHT AS WE SEEK TO IMPROVE THE BILL- I APPRECIATE IT FROM FROM ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AS WE TRY TO IMPROVE IT I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A PERFECT SYSTEM- MY BELIEF IS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE- WE DO HAVE WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO COULD OR WOULD DO HARM. TO OTHERS WHO ARE PAYING THE WAY OUT AND- AND- POSING A RISK TO THE COMMUNITY WE HAVE FOLKS WERE ABSOLUTELY NO RISK WILL COME TO OTHER HEARING TOOK SIMPLY CAN'T BE RELEASED BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR BUT THAT IS WRONG YOU KNOW WE NEED TO CHANGE IT HOW WE CHANGE IT IS UP FOR- IMPORTANT DEBATE SB TEN WAS A PROPOSAL- HAD SOME REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS TO IT HAD SOME DOCTOR PRETTY CONTROVERSY THIS IS ON ANOTHER RUN AT STRENGTHENING AND MAKE IT MORE FAIR- THE SYSTEM WE THINK THAT. WHILE IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT GOES A LONG WAY TOWARDS BEING BOTH SAFE AND FAIR YOU CAN AND- WE MUST DO BOTH THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE- SO. WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STARTING POINT. YOUR INPUT TODAY. AND ASK YOUR- I THANK YOU MR BY NOTED THE IS A VERY NOT ONLY TO YOU BUT SET SEVERAL MEMBERS INDIA IN THE ASSEMBLY- THE DATE THE COMMENTS FROM SOLANO BEST WOMEN IN IN MISTER MORSE ARE WELL TAKEN- RIGHT NOW. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS COMMITTEE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE ALL THE INFORMATION ON HEARING OF A COOPER BUILT THAT I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT I'M JUST NOT HEARING ABOUT IT- I. WOULD THE TROUBLING PART IS SETTING UP A COMMISSION OF ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS PROBABLY A NONSTARTER SO IT LET'S MAKE SURE AND I KNOW HAVING RISK ASSESSMENT AS YOU AND I KNOW. THIS IS PROBABLY A NONSTARTER FOR THE FOR THE- THE PRO SIDE- THERE. AND I WANT THIS COMMITTEE. TWO ULTIMATELY THESE MEMBERS HERE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT NOW TO WEIGH IN HEAVILY ON HOW THIS ULTIMATELY IS AND AS MISTER MISTER QUIRKS OF HIS SAGE WISDOM SAID NO BILL GETS OUT HERE UNTOUCHED OR UNCHANGED AND SO- I WOULD ASK THAT WE MOVE THIS BILL OUT KNOWING THAT IT GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS. KNOWING THAT MR WHATEVER OTHER BILLS IF THERE'S MORE THAN ONE DOT COM WILL HAVE TO COME OUR WAY. AND WE CAN WE CAN AND WHICH IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WE CAN ACTUALLY PROBABLY. TRY TO CRAFT POLICY COMPROMISED A CRAFT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL MOVE FORWARD WITH BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY- SPECIALLY MY COMMUNITY- ENDING CASH BAIL ON POOR PEOPLE IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND- WHAT I'M HEARING AND I MAY BE WRONG WHAT I'M HEARING IS EVERYONE. AS THE BRIDGE IS SPECIALLY HERE AGREES WE SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF- JUST BAIL SYSTEM. WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT FOUR ZERO BAIL. OR RISK ASSESSMENT BAIL OR WHATEVER OR JUDGE JUDICIAL BURIAL- I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY HERE- TO WORK WITH YOU. AND ANY OTHERS TO KIND OF. TRYING TO CRAFT DATA INTO IT'S ONE THING SO I'M ASKING- ALL. MEMBERS IF YOU CAN'T THE MOVE THIS OUT KNOWING THAT WE HAVE OTHERS COMING IN. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY TO HOPEFULLY CRAFT SOMETHING. THAT WE'RE NOT WE GET OUT OF OUR HOUSE BUT WE'LL GET OUT OF THE OTHER HOUSE AND THAT- SAYS IT IS AN ASSEMBLY BILL. REGION WE CAN LOOK AT IT AND BE VERY PROUD OF IT BECAUSE WE CRAFTED THE FINAL DISSOLUTION. THAT'S WHEN ASKING FOR A LITTLE. CALL THE ROLL. DO WE HAVE A MOTION.

THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MEMBERS ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO START OFTEN BY PRAISING HER EXCELLENT STAFF THE PROVIDING OF THE PROFESSIONALISM THAT AND THEIR EXPERTISE IN OUR BILL I'M HERE PERCENT AB THREE ZERO EIGHT A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A VEHICLE BURGLARY AND AUTO THEFT TASK FORCE AND THREE MULTI COUNTY REGIONS SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES AND THE BAY AREA. THAT COVERAGE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR STATE THE TASK FORCE WILL IDENTIFY AND APPREHEND CRIMINALS WHO STEAL VEHICLES VEHICLE PARTS AS WELL THOSE WHO BREAK INTO VEHICLES TO STEAL THE BELONGINGS INSIDE. THIS BILL WOULD ASSIST LOCAL AGENCIES BY SHARING INFORMATION OBTAIN PROPER EQUIPMENT AND DEVELOPING BEST PRACTICES TO TACKLE THIS NEW FORM OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN RECENT YEARS VEHICLE BURGLARIES HAVE BEEN A GROWING ISSUE IN THE BAY AREA THERE'S NOW A RISING CONCERN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC MULTIPLE NEWS ARTICLES HAVE REPORTED GAINS FROM THE BAY AREA WE'RE COMING TO PARTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND OTHER COURSES NATION'S SPECIFICALLY TARGETING VEHICLES THAT WERE LIKELY RENTED BY TOURISTS. THESE TARGETS WERE DESIRABLE SINCE THE VICTIM WAS LIKELY UNABLE TO RETURN TO TESTIFY IN COURT. AND PROVE THAT THEIR VEHICLE DOORS WERE LOCKED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE VICTIM'S ABSENCE HAS LED TO A VEHICLE BREAK INS AND THEFTS GOING UNPUNISHED FOR MANY YEARS. SINCE COVER NINETEEN SHUT DOWNS YEARS AGO. VEHICLE THEFTS AND BURGLARIES HAVE SKYROCKETED WHILE MANY OTHER CRIMES HAVE DECREASED. CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS REQUIRE VEHICLES TO THROW AND TO KNOW HOW CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE BEING EQUITY IN THEIR VEHICLES CURRENTLY. JUST LAST WEEK I HAD A CONSTITUENT CALL- BEGGING THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE INCREASING THEFT OF CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. THESE PARTS HAVE BECOME A POPULAR TARGET BY THIEVES DUE TO DIFFICULTY IN TRACKING CADILLAC INVERTERS. COURTS SINCE THERE'S NO SERIAL NUMBER ATTACHED TO THE CAR. VEHICLE CRIMES HAVE RISEN TO INTOLERABLE LEVELS ACROSS STATE AS A WHOLE. I HAVE SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES THAT WILL GO INTO THE PRINT IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. YOU MEMBERS OF THE BILL. THANK YOU- WITH THAT- WILL PASS THIS INFORMATION TO ONE OF THE- I WILL MISS TESTIMONY WITH MR RAIMES FROM AND FROM THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION.

AB THREE OH EIGHT SIX TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION BY ESTABLISHING THE VEHICLE BURGLARY AND THEFT TASK FORCE BUT STATEWIDE COORDINATED EFFORT TO PROVIDE STATE FUNDING TO IDENTIFY APPREHEND. AND PREVENT CRIMINALS UP BREAKING THE VEHICLE TO STEAL PERSONAL BELONGINGS ANALYTICAL ITSELF. THIS BILL WILL ASSIST LOCAL AGENCIES BY ALLOWING THEM TO SHARE INFORMATION ACROSS JURISDICTIONS ABOUT CARD PASSED THE BURGLARY. AND TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES. THE SHARING OF INTELLIGENCE BETWEEN THE TASK FORCE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE SPECIFIC VEHICLE BURGLARY AND THEFT ACTIVITIES. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE SCOPE OF INTELLIGENCE THAT IS CURRENTLY SHARED. THE ALLOCATED MONEY IS DEPENDENT ON THE REGION'S NEEDS AND COULD BE TOWARD PUT TOWARDS SALARIES EQUIPMENT AND TRAVEL REPRESENTS THE NATURE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT ARE HEAVILY IMPACTED BY VEHICLE RELATED CRIMES. THIS UPDATED EQUIPMENT WILL PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE ADEQUATE TOOLS NEEDED. TO STOP CAR BURGLARIES. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO ESTABLISH AN APPOINTMENT A JOINT INVESTIGATIVE TEAMS THAT WILL BE DESIGNED TO CONSTRUCT EFFORTS IN AREAS IN THE STATE EXPERIENCING A HIGH RATE OF THESE CRIMES. THEY CONTINUE OFFICES BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TRANSLATIONALLY TRAINING AND A COOPERATIVE EFFORTS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES STATEWIDE WILL REDUCE THIS TREND AS WELL AS INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF STATEWIDE VEHICLE.

I PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED THIS NOT THAT LONG AGO PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND- IT'S A- IT'S A BIG FRUSTRATION. AND IT'S A SITUATION WHERE. A LOT OF THESE AUTO BURGLARY FOLKS ARE COMMITTING THIS OFFENCE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE- ONE DAY AND IT'S A IT'S A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM IN A LOT OF IT.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS BILL IS THERE ANY CURRENT LAW THAT PREVENTS RIGHT NOW REGIONAL TASK FORCE FROM OPERATING THE WAY YOU'D WANT THEM TO OPERATE FROM COORDINATING TOGETHER. FEDERAL HIGHWAY PATROL HAS SOMETHING- CURRENTLY IN LINE HOWEVER THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL REVENUE CURRENTLY TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE MODELS UNDERSTAND IT. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS NO FORMAL STANDARDS HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WORK TOGETHER. ON THIS RIGHT NOW HAS A OFTEN PROCESS SO EVEN THOUGH IN THIS CURRENT BILL THAT'S L. A. COUNTY SANTA COUNTY AND- AREAS AND- THE BAY AREA- OTHER COUNTIES. HAVE THE OPTION TO COME IN AT TO THIS CONTEST WORSE. I ALSO SAW THAT WELL THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO WHAT THIS COULD BE FUNDED FOR THE STRUCTURE FOR APPLICATION THE GRANTS I DON'T SEE A FUNDING MECHANISM FOR IT I KNOW THIS POLICIES OFFICE OR I'M SORRY. IS COMMITTEES OBVIOUSLY- GOVERNING THE POLICY OF IT HOW MUCH DO YOU I'D IDEALLY. ENVISIONED THE GRASS TO BE HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST THE STATE AND I'M JUST WONDERING HOW HOW YEAH WONDER HOW MUCH YOU TO ENVISION THE TOTAL PRESS THREE. SUMMER WITHOUT SAFE AND HAS A QUESTION A CURRENT ESTIMATES OF STATE THAT IT COULD COST AS MUCH AS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS CERTAINLY AS WE MOVE FOR- WE'RE TRULY OPEN TO. OPEN THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION TO DISCUSSION OF HOW WE CAN MITIGATE SOME OF THE- COSTS OF THE PROPOSAL. THAT'S GOOD WELL THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT IT'S TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT. COULD BE PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED WHEN OF COURSE WE'RE ALSO STRUGGLING TO AFFORD. MANY OF OUR SOCIAL SERVICES AND OUR SCHOOLS SO IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THE FIGURE THAT IS ENVISIONED BY THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU SUMMER. THANK YOU. WITH WITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IN THE LETTER THAT THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION POLICY CENTER SUBMITTED IN TERMS OF THEIR OPPOSITION- THEY TALKED ABOUT CONCERNS AROUND PRIVACY RUN DATA SHARING- THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW TASK FORCE HAVING A LONG HISTORY OF HARMING LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO RACIAL PROFILING- AND CREATING KIND OF. A CLIMATE OF FEAR- PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- AND SPECIFICALLY FOR NONCITIZENS THERE AT THE RISK OF DATA GOING TO ICE AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES. WHICH I DO SHARE THAT CONCERN CAN YOU ADDRESS SOME OF THAT AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU PLANNING HANDLING SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SOMEONE WAKES. UP THE INFORMATION THE STATE IS ALREADY BEING SHARED BETWEEN AGENCIES. IT DOESN'T EXPAND THE CONTENT OF INFORMATION THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING SHARED- NOR WILL THERE BE ANY QUESTIONS IN THE AREAS. OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP THAT IS COMPLETELY PRIVATE. AND WHAT'S THE SORT OF OVERSIGHT OF THIS TASK FORCE. WILL BE BETWEEN THE AGENCIES THEMSELVES. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME NUMBER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE- I APPRECIATE ALL THE QUESTIONS- AND CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD AS THIS IS THE FIRST PROCESS IN THIS HOUSE AND AS THIS IS WILL BE DOUBLE REFERRED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND FUTURE COMMITTEES ON SOME THE QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS. THANK YOU MISTER CHEN I DO BELIEVE DOING A TASK FORCES IS THE WAY TO GO SO WE CAN IRON OUT A LOT OF THESE THESE PROBLEMS AND IN THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY WORKING ON A LOT OF TIMES WE DO LOS AND THEN WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED SO GETTING TOGETHER AND FIGURING OUT. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU MISTER. MAY CALL THE ROLL OUT OF SECTOR.

FOUR ONE NINE ITEM NUMBER SIX CRIMINAL PROCEDURE VICTIM AND WITNESS PRIVACY. WE'RE NOT YOUR FIRST COMMITTEE ACT PARK YOUR MY SECOND SET. NO YOU'RE LIKE MY SECOND BILL I SHOULD SAY THAT OKAY. ALREADY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB FOUR ONE NINE I FIRST LIKE TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY STAFF TO AMEND THE BILL IN A WAY THAT CLEARED UP ANY CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT A VICTIM OR WITNESS SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER BIRTHDATE EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND BIOMETRIC INFORMATION AMONGST A HOST OF OTHER THINGS ARE NOT PROTECTED DEFENDED OR THEIR FAMILY COULD REQUEST AND RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION WITHOUT A COURT ORDER. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN CASES INVOLVING FRAUD OR THEFT. WHERE THE CRIMINAL DISCOVERY MAY INCLUDE A TREASURE TROVE OF PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SUCH AS EMAIL ACCOUNTS DATE OF BIRTH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS BANK RECORDS CREDIT CARDS AND DRIVER'S LICENSE. AB FOUR ONE NINE IS A SIMPLE MEASURE TO PROTECT CERTAIN TYPES OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION THAT CAN BE DISCLOSED TO A DEFENDANT. IF SUCH INFORMATION IS NEEDED BY THE DEFENSE TO BUILD THE CASE THIS BILL KEEPS CURRENT LAW IN TAPPED. BY ALLOWING THE COURT TO REQUIRE THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER. AB FOUR ONE NINE HAS POTENTIAL TO HELP THE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES OF CRIME THE PEACE OF MIND THAT IF THEY COME FORWARD WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASE. THE STATE CAN PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM. THE BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCEOF BAR ASSOCIATIONS AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY VIA PHONE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IS MICHAEL FOR ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR THANK YOU MOVE THE BILL. SECOND I DO. YOU HAVE A WITNESS IF YOU HAVE A WITNESS.

THIS MEASURE- BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AB FOUR ONE NINE SIX IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY BY UPDATING THIRTY YEAR OLD LANGUAGE IN CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEMS THAT REACT. NPR PROTECTION TEN FOUR POINT TWO. WHICH PROTECTS THE INFORMATION THAT BY PROTECTING THE PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF VICTIMS WITNESSES. CURRENTLY THE LAW ALLOWED HELPFUL NUMBERS AND ADDRESSES TO BE DISCLOSED TO THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND DEFENSE INVESTIGATORS BUT RESTRICTS FURTHER DISSEMINATION. OF THAT INFORMATION- AFTER THE COURT APPROVED SHOWING OF NEED. AB FOUR ONE NINE WOULD EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS INCLUDE A VICTIM OR WITNESS IS PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION GENERALLY PUBLIC SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS- AND THAT IS WHY PPBM SUPPORTERS UP IN THE SPONSOR OF EIGHTY FOUR ONE NINE- BELIEVING THAT ADVANCE THE GOAL OF PUBLIC SAFETY- ADVANCING THE GOAL OF MODERNIZING LAW AND URGES COMMITTEE SUPPORT.

ALL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER ON THE LINE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. AS A REMINDER PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AND WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU ARE NAY QUESTIONS FROM FROM MEMBERS. MISS REBECCA BAUER CAN'T. THINK HERE- FIRST ONE IS AB THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY THE PROTECTION OF VICTIMS AND WITNESSES IS CRITICAL IN GETTING JUSTICE IN OUR SYSTEM I HAD A QUESTION OBVIOUSLY THE BILL ALLOWS FOR DEFENSE ATTORNEYS TO RECEIVE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION REPAIRED OFFENSE HAS IS. MAKES SENSE- OBVIOUSLY IN HEARING A DEFENSE AND WORKING WITH A CLIENT AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY ENGAGES IN AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE CHANCES ARE OF WINNING YOUR CASE TO COURT IN PLAYING OUT XCERRA AND SO DOING IS IN CONVERSATION WITH THEIR CLIENTS ABOUT THE CASE- OBVIOUSLY IN THAT THERE'S NO NEED TO SHARE TELEPHONE NUMBERS ADDRESSES ETCETERA I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT IN THAT CONVERSATION SHOULD. THE EMPLOYER FOR EXAMPLE OR THE NATURE OF THE WORK AND THE INDIVIDUAL AND VICTIM COME UP IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE CASE THAT WOULD SEEM LIKE A VIOLATION OF THIS LAW SO I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON THAT BRIEFLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ATTORNEY AND THE CLIENT IS REALLY CRITICAL. WELL I CAN TELL YOU AT LEAST AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW ANY TYPE OF PENALTY THAT COMES FOUR EIGHT. AND A CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW HAS IT THAT IF THE DEFENSE CONSERVE VIOLATES THIS PROVISION NOT ONLY WAS IT A DISHONEST METER BUT- THEY'RE ALSO SUBJECT TO PENALTY AND POTENTIAL DISPARITY FROM THE STATE BAR. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A SUFFICIENT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH PENALTY. RAISE MY QUESTION IS IN THE PENALTY ON THE ATTORNEY THE QUESTION IS. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS COULD- TO ATTORNEY BE BARRED FROM HAVING AN HONEST CONVERSATION WITH THEIR CLIENT ABOUT THE CASE BECAUSE THE BREADTH OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS NOT PROTECTED. IS SO WIDE. RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T GIVE I MEAN IT WAS BEFORE I BELIEVE TELEPHONE NUMBER ADDRESS IS JUST AS TO ADDRESS THOSE TWO THINGS WHICH IS EASY AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO HAVE A- FULL CONVERSATION WITH A QUITE WITHOUT GIVING UP THAT INFORMATION IS NOT NECESSARY. HOWEVER I CAN IMAGINE AS THE OPPOSITION POINTS OUT SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR CLIENT ABOUT. THE NATURE OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE VICTIM RIGHT IN DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE CASE AND WHETHER THEY SHOULD PLEAD OR GO TO TRIAL OR- WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE AND THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THIS LAW. LEADING TO DISBARMENT AND A MISDEMEANOR AND I GUESS THAT CONCERNS ME THAT THAT CLIENT ATTORNEY RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE HAMPERED BECAUSE OF THE REST OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S NOT PROTECTED. WHAT I BELIEVE ON THIS AND- IN THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LOOK UP IS THAT THAT WAS IT THAT IF THEY NEEDED TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT WOULD HELP YOU KNOW BE PART OF THE CASE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ASK FOR IT. OKAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY. IDEA AT. BEST IS THIS MR FERN. YES GO AHEAD- YES IT TO ADD TO THAT- MY UNDERSTANDING IMPROPER NOT. I THINK I'M NOT MISTAKEN I BELIEVE ONE OF THE MEN MEANT THAT- WERE BEING CONSIDERED AND WAS BEING ACCEPTED IT WOULD BE TO ALSO ADDED THAT THAT THE FIVE EXCEPTION- THE LOCATION OF EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS SPECIFIED. AS A FORM OF PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE- PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION DOESN'T INCLUDE THE NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT SO- EIGHT POTENTIALLY COULD CERTAINLY SPEAK TO THE CLIENT ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF JOB IT WITNESS DIED- AND WITH B. I BELIEVE THE ACCEPTED AMENDMENT AGAIN- FIVE LONG. WOULD BE KEPT AMENDMENT IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THEM TO STOP THE LOCATION OF THE- THE- WITNESSES EMPLOYMENT AS. WELL AS HELPFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MISTER. AND JUST BUILDING A OF THAT JUST TO CLEAR SO. IF THE IT'S BELIEVES COULD HELP THE DEFENDANT'S CASE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION OR- THEY ARE THE MR FOR AND IF YOU WANT TO JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT PLEASE- TWENTY FOUR POINT TWO OUTLINES THE PROCESS BY WHICH IT P. I. YOU CAN POINT TO BE SHARED WITH A THIRD PARTY SUCH AS THE DEPENDENT AND OR THE FAMILY- THE THEY JUST NEED TO BE A SHOWING BY THE BAND THAT TO HOW IT'S RELEVANT TO THEIR DEFENSE HOW IMPORTANT TO BE DISCUSSED AND SHARED WITH THEM- BUT JUST AS A GENERAL RULE- I THINK THIS. CARRY NUMBERS PAPER BURKE. AND OTHER BY BYE METRICS BE SHARED. WITH THE PARTIES GOT IT OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL AND- WHEN YOU TOOK THE MOST YOU KNOW IF THE OPPOSITION IS COMING OFF OF THE BILL BECAUSE OF THAT OR- WE HAVE NOT HEARD. DID MISTER LUCKY AND NOW. WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR MY BILL AND I ASKED FOR. NINE THE PROVIDENCE SECONDED OF I THINK WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS. ANOTHER FRIEND HOPE WE CAN MOVE DECIDED COMMITTEE CHAIRED RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE. ON EIGHTY FOUR NINETEEN BY SOME MEMBER DAVIS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY LACKEY I'VE EVER CAN JACKIE HAND AYE CORK AYE CORK AYE SANTIAGO CA ARE TOO HIGH C. R. TWO I WICKS. WICKS I LEE. WE I. THANK YOU VERY BILL PASSES CONGRATULATIONS THANKS FOR. I AM NUMBER EIGHT AB FORTY EIGHT. RENDON GONZALEZ. LAW ENFORCEMENT KINETIC ENERGY PROJECTILES CHEMICAL AGENTS. YEAH. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. IT'S ON IT'S ON BE CAREFUL NO LIGHT. M. SO THANK YOU I GUESS IT'S A MORE SIMPLE WAY TO SAY THIS IS WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME REGULATIONS FOR RUBBER BULLETS AND TEAR GAS. ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY EIGHT WILL SET CLEAR MINIMUM STANDARDS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT'S USE OF SO CALLED LESS THAN LETHAL WEAPONS LIKE RUBBER BULLETS PEPPER SPRAY TEAR GAS FOR CROWD CONTROL REQUIRE REPORTING OTHER USE TO THE DOJ. LAST SUMMER AT LEAST A HUNDRED PROTESTERS BYSTANDERS AND JOURNALISTS THAT WE KNOW OF ACROSS THE COUNTRY SIXTEEN SERIOUS INJURIES FROM RUBBER BULLETS AND BEAN BAG ROUNDS AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING SEVEN PEOPLE WHO LOST AN EYE. WE'VE ALL SEEN JUST HOW DANGEROUS LESS THAN LETHAL WEAPONS CAN BE IN THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THAT A TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDY FOUND THAT 3% OF PEOPLE HIT WITH RUBBER BULLETS ACTUALLY DIE IN 15% ARE LEFT PERMANENTLY DISABLED IT IS CLEAR THAT THESE WEAPONS ARE INAPPROPRIATE FOR SIMPLE CROWD CONTROL. NO ONE WHO SIMPLY EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO PROTEST SHOULD BE SCARED TO FACE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH BECAUSE OFFICERS ARE INDISCRIMINATELY FIRING RUBBER BULLETS INTO A CROWD FOR USING HARMFUL CHEMICAL AGENTS. AB FORTY EIGHT WOULD CREATE STANDARDS THAT ONLY ALLOW TRAINED OFFICERS TO USE THESE TOOLS AND WEAPONS IF THERE'S A THREAT TO LIFE OR SERIOUS INJURY TO AN INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS MAY NOT USE THEM SOLELY FOR VIOLATIONS OF IMPOSED CURFEW BECAUSE OF VERBAL THREATS OR NON COMPLIANCE FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE. OFFICERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES FIRST INCLUDING WARNING THE CROWD AND GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE SCENE BEFORE THEY DEPLOY THESE WEAPONS THEY COULD ONLY USE THESE WEAPONS IN A MATTER PROPORTIONAL TO THE THREAT NOT INDISCRIMINATELY AGAINST A CROWD OR TARGETED AT THE HEAD OR NECK. AB FORTY EIGHT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE POLICE DEPARTMENTS REPORT THE USE OF KINETIC PROJECTILES AND CHEMICAL AGENTS TO THE DOJ MONTHLY WHICH WILL FURTHER PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY ON THESE PROJECTILES AND CHEMICAL AGENTS THIS BILL IS LONG OVERDUE AND IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA BE A LEADER IN PROTECTING PROTESTERS. AGAINST EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE BY THE POLICE. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TODAY WHO CAN SPEAK ABOUT THE LONG LASTING IMPACTS OF THESE DANGEROUS WEAPONS WHEN USED IMPROPERLY THEY'RE ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU. THAT'S YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND DR ROHINI HAAR. N. FORSCHER KOHNER TO SHEA COOK FOR SHEA. AND YOU CAN BEGIN. ANYTIME YOU WANT. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES IN MY NAME. BUT. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. RIGHT MY NAME IS RANI HAAR I'M A RESEARCHER AND AN EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA I THIRTY PROTESTS AND THE USE OF CROWD CONTROL WEAPONS PRIMARILY WITH PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. FIRST I WANTED TO SHARE A FEW BROADER POINT. ONE IS THAT PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS ARE ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PILLARS OF THE DEMCRATIC PROCESS IN THIS COUNTRY IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ADVOCATE NOTABLE. CHIU INCITING PROTESTS THE VAST MAJORITY ARE PEACEFUL AND EVEN WHEN PROTESTS TURNED VIOLENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROTESTERS IN THOSE CROWDS ARE STILL PEACEFUL. THE MERE FACT THAT A DEMONSTRATION IS BEING ILLEGAL OR THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VIOLENT DOES NOT JUSTIFY DISBURSING THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY. OR USING CROWD CONTROL WEAPONS. THIRD THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD TO PREVENT VIOLENCE IN PROTEST TO ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS AND OPEN DIALOGUE BETWEEN PROTESTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE USE OF THESE CAR CONTROL WEAPONS ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT WHEN DEALING WITH GENUINE AN IMMINENT THREAT TO SAFETY OF PEOPLE PRESENT. AND THE ONLY OTHER OUT OTHER OPTIONS HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED. ON CROWD CONTROL WEAPONS ARE DEPLOYED THERE ARE IMPORTANT GUIDELINE. THEY MUST BE NECESSARY THERE YOU THIRTY PROPORTIONATE AND TARGETED AND IT MUST NOT BE MISUSED. UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS NOT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST YEAR. I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY PROTEST BUT I STUDIED WITH THE USE OF CROWD CONTROL WEAPONS HAS DE ESCALATED TENSIONS. OR MADE THE SITUATION FAVOR. IT OFTEN DOES QUITE THE OPPOSITE. I'VE WORKED WITH MANY MANY COLLEAGUES ACTED ON BEHALF OF PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. HELP AFFECT THE OF CONTROL WEAPONS. MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED A REPORT ON THE USE OF GENETIC IMPACT PROJECTILES COME SOMETIMES CALLED RUBBER BULLETS. SO THERE ARE MUCH MORE THAN THAT. THE REPORT IS CALLED SHOT IN THE HEAD AND FIND A HUNDRED FIFTEEN PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT HEAD INJURIES. JUMPED AFTER THE KILLING OF GEORGE FOUR EIGHT IN TWENTY TWENTY. MANY OF THEM WERE IN CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE WELCOME TO SEE THE VISUAL INVESTIGATION FOR YOURSELF YOU CAN GOOGLE SHOT IN THE HEAD AND PHR. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER RESEARCH OUTPUTS AND HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU. OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN CRAPPIE BUT WEAPONS ARE USED UNNECESSARILY DISPROPORTIONATELY AND WHEN THEIR VIEWS. WE SEE MORE INJURIES DISABILITIES AND EVEN DEATH AND THIS IS A MONTH ON ARMED CIVILIANS. PERFECTLY RUBBER BULLETS AND ALL OTHER CONNECTICUT IMPACT PROJECTILES ARE DANGEROUS WHEN USED IN CROWDS. AT SHORT RANGES AND AT LONG RANGES AT ANY RANGE. AND TEAR GAS IF YOU SO PERVASIVELY AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD BUT MANY PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY CHILDREN THE ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH CHRONIC FROM LUNG PROBLEMS ARE SPECIALLY VULNERABLE. I'M HEARTENED TO KNOW THAT WE'RE TO PLEASED TO TAKE SPECIFIC STEPS TO ENSURE THE CROWD CONTROL WEAPONS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE BETTER REGULATED. TO GUARD AGAINST THE DANGERS OF DANGEROUS OVER YOU. IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE THAT THIS LEGISLATION AND OTHERS LIKE IT CAN HELP PROTECT THE RIGHT TO PROTEST AND SAFEGUARD THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS DEMONSTRATING TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS POCHE.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME PROPOSALS. BUT IN THE OTHER HOUSE ABOUT MEDIA ACCESS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN REGARDS TO BE A LEADER BILL- THAT THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN HAS AS WELL THERE'S OBVIOUSLY. A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT COME UP WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE HAPPEN AND WHAT WE WANT TO AVOID BUT WHAT UNFORTUNATELY WE FEEL THAT THE BILL WILL BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. ARE HAVING TO IF YOU TAKE AWAY SOME OF THESE AGENTS. IT WILL ACTUALLY LEAD TO POTENTIALLY THE NEED TO USE- OTHER- SYSTEMS THAT MAY PLACE- THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE MORE HARMFUL THAN- TEAR GAS OR RUBBER BOATS SUCH AS BATONS ARE POTENTIALLY. DEADLY COURSE THESE ARE MEANT TO BE- WHAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE IS MEANT TO BE LESS SLEEP ALL OPTIONS THAT AGENCIES WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE UNDER SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WORKING QUICKLY TURNED FROM. A PEACEFUL PROTESTER DEMONSTRATION INTO- SOME OF THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY BE VASTLY OUTNUMBERED BY POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS TO ONE- AND ALSO IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THE STATE THAT A CHEMICAL AGENT CAN BE DEPLOYED IF IT'S TEAR GAS- THAT ONLY A COMMANDING OFFICER AT THE SCENE- CAN OPERATE THAT. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF WE WOULD APPRECIATE SOME CLARITY ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR ABOUT. YOU KNOW IF THE COMMANDER IS AT ONE END OF THE A LONG STREET IS THAT CONSIDERED. APPETITE ASSEMBLY PROTEST DEMONSTRATION AND HAPPENS TO BE USED ELSEWHERE FOR PEOPLE THAT AREN'T COMPLYING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVES OF THE BILL STATING THAT IT ENDS UP BEING USE WHAT POTENTIALLY IS. THE LIABILITY THERE- SO THERE'S JUST SOME OTHER THINGS OF WHAT THE BILL PROPOSES GOING ALL THOSE GOING THROUGH ALL OF THOSE STEPS- TO ENSURE- PROPER USAGE WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE- APPRECIATION ADVOCATE AND I KNOW AGENCIES. ESPECIALLY GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES OVER THE LAST YEAR- ARE LOOKING AT ALL THOSE STEPS IS VIRTUALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THOUGH WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY OUR FOCUS WHERE THESE TYPE OF INCIDENTS. OVERALL YOU SUPPORT INCIDENTS HAVE DECREASED BUT AS WE LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC INCIDENTS WE WANT TO GET TO THE TO THE RIGHT PLACE BUT WE FEEL THAT- WHAT THE BILL PROPOSES IN TERMS OF- VIOLATIONS IMPOSE CURFEW VERBAL THREATS. NO COMPLAINTS WITH FUND PORTION DIRECTIVES NURSE OKAY IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY THESE- THE ABILITY TO USE SOME OF THESE AGENTS AND SEVEN THAT FORMS THE BASIS OF PARK.

OUR DEFINITIONS I HOPE THAT THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT SO IN THE END WE CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT. THAT THEY CAN AT LEAST NOT OPPOSE. THANK YOU. YEAH IT KIND OF SURPRISED ME A TO BE HONEST THE- COMMANDING OFFICER GIVING THE DIRECTION ACTUALLY CAME FROM A SERIES OF MEETINGS I HAD WITH DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS SO. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY JUST HAVE AN ALL SPOKEN ARE ALL AGREE ON THE BEST- PERSON TO MAKE THE CALL- IN SO I WILL AGAIN DO THE ROUNDS BUT IT IT'S HARD OBVIOUSLY IF THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT WHO. WHO AND HOW THAT SHOULD BE DONE BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU MISS WICKS THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL I THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL THE STORY YOUR WITNESS. TESTIFIED TO HIS HORRIFIC AND IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AND WE SAW ALL THESE SITUATIONS LAST YEAR- I OBVIOUSLY FOR THE WHAT BUT WILL BUT I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO ADD MUSICAL AUTHORS WELL. ABSOLUTELY. YOU MAY AREAS OF YES MUST GIVE ME A NEWS MEMBER MR LEE I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR LEADERSHIP OPPOSING THIS GENEROUSLY REASONABLE BILL TO BAN THE USE OF THE LESS THAN LETHAL WEAPONS IN MY DISTRICT ALONE THERE'S ONE THERE'S ONE PERSON WHO WAS SHOT IN THE EYE AND LOST HIS LEFT EYE AS ANOTHER PERSON WHO WAS SHOT AND PERHAPS YOU MAY NEVER HAVE CHILDREN. THAT IS A TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF WHEN PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING HISTORIC AND HISTORIC NUMBERS IN THE SUMMER AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY IT'S IRONIC THAT A HISTORIC AMOUNT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCED POLICE BRUTALITYAND KNOW THE TASTE OF BEING SHOT AT OR TEAR GAS I MYSELF KNOW HOW AWFUL IT IS TO BE CHOKING OUT YOUR GRASS WILL ALSO BE FLASH BANG WITH A FLASH GRENADES. SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TO CO AUTHOR THIS BILL WITH YOU AND ALSO TO SUPPORT YOU IN THIS EFFORTS AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOTE THAT CHEMICAL AGENTS LIKE TEAR GAS HAVE BEEN BANNED FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE AFTER WORLD WAR ONE SO THEY HAVE NO PLACE ON THE BATTLEFIELD THEY CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A PLACE ON OUR STREETS AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU. YES MISBACH YOU LIKE FOR ME TO SAY REBEKAH POWER K. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK ON THIS BILL I THINK THAT WE SAW YOU'RE A WITNESS SPOKE POWERFULLY ABOUT WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN THIS THESE TOOLS ARE MISUSED AND THAT IS THE LAST THING ANY OF US WANT I THINK WE ALSO SIGNED JANUARY AT THE INSTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN POLICE ARE OVERWHELMED AND- WHEN THERE IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE TRYING TO BREAK THE LINE THREATEN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND SO THE BALANCE THAT YOU HAVE WORKED VERY HARD I CAN TELL FOR. SURE IT'S EASIER TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE IS WELL DONE AND I CAN TELL THAT IT'S BEEN DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MANY GROUPS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE PARTS DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU. THE FOURTEENTH. OF JULY OKAY. YES WELL CERTAINLY AT I DO BELIEVE THAT- SOME OF THE ACTIONS THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM THE- THESE- PROCESSES ARE OF A CONCERN AND DESERVE DISCUSSION. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN A PROTESTER DEMONSTRATION AND RIOT. HAVING BEEN IN THE POSITION OF WITNESSING BOTH. THERE'S A CLEAR DIFFERENCE AND WHEN SOMEONE STARTS TO RESORT TO OVERT ACTIONS. AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT THE BECOMES A VERY DANGEROUS VERY BALL SAID CIRCUMSTANCES. UNDER YOUR PROVISION ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ LET ME ASK YOU WHAT WOULD ROCK THROWING BE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH. TO USE IT IS IT WASN'T DANGER YES BUT IT HAS TO BE DIRECTED AT THE PERSON THROWING ROCKS I MEAN THERE'S IT'S A REASONABLY OBJECTIVE STANDARD YOU CAN'T SIMPLY SAY- SOMEBODY THREW A ROCK AND SO WE'RE GOING TO SPRAY RUBBER BULLETS ACROSS THIS CROWD I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE BUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE CANNOT BE GIVEN HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT THAT BE- TAKEN SERIOUSLY BECAUSE- I'VE ACTUALLY HAD PROJECT- PROJECTILES THROWN AT ME. IN A SITUATION AND I'M TELLING YOU. IT FEELS EXTREMELY. THREATENING BECAUSE OF SOME OF THOSE PROJECTILES EVEN THOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES HAVE EQUIPMENT. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES- BUT THAT. IS STILL VERY DANGEROUS VERY UGLY SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT HAVE TO BE QUELLED AND HAVE TO BE TOLD THAT THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR. AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE MISSION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THEY GO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS A TO STOP THEM FROM PROTESTING OR SENDING THEIR- THEIR MESSAGE OF- DISAGREEMENT WITH WHATEVER. SITUATION EXISTS IT'S TO KEEP THINGS PEACEFUL. I WANT PEOPLE. YOU CAN LAUGH ALL YOU WANT BUT IT'S FUNNY WHEN SOMEONE STOLE A BOTTLE AT U. S. NINETY WHEN YOU. GOING TO ACCESS TO MY- REQUESTION BUT IT'S ALSO NOT THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE SHOT AT PERFECTLY INNOCENT BYSTANDERS IN LOSING THEIR ICE. ALL RIGHT SO IT IS A GIVE AND TAKE AND I HAVE MET WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS BILL AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND YOU SHOULD BUT TO SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE AN OFFICER IS AFRAID BECAUSE SOMEBODY THREW A ROCK AT HIM THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE. OR SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO INDISCRIMINATELY. SPRAY RUBBER BULLETS. AT A CROWD. IT IS OFFENSIVE TO MY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO PROTEST. THIS IS A SPECIALIZED AFRAID. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY'RE ACTING OKAY. HALF OF OTHER PEOPLE AND I DON'T THINK THAT WAS VERY FAIR EITHER AND- I JUST WANT TO SEE THE- LIGHT. I DO AGREE WITH. THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH THIS ISSUE. BUT I THINK IT DOES APPROACH AND THIS BILL BEFORE ME. THIS TO EXTREME A VERY VERY AMBIGUOUS ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS. AND I CAN TELL THAT YOU'RE NOT IN A- MOOD RIGHT NOW TO DISCUSS OKAY ASSEMBLY SIDE I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYMORE. I AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR SAYING AFRAID AT THAT IS WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY IT IS A VERY SCARY SITUATION AND I'M SORRY IF I USE MY WORDS TO SAY IF AN OFFICER IS AFRAID I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN EXCUSE I STILL DON'T THINK IT'S AN EXCUSE. SO I WILL BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU ARE IN WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS NOT AMBIGUOUS IT'S VERY SPECIFIC ON WHAT OFFICERS NEED TO DO. TO DE ESCALATE AND TO WARN THAT THIS TYPE OF USE OF FORCE IS GOING TO BE USED IF THERE IS A DIFFERENT WAY TO APPROACH THAT I'D BE HAPPY I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR TWO YEARS I'D BE HAPPY TO HEAR IT. BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE WE'RE AT RIGHT HERE IN AND- NO BILL LIKE THIS HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THIS IS WHY. BUT WE HAVE TO PROTECT INNOCENT BYSTANDERS AT PEACEFUL PROTEST IT IS JUST TO FUNDAMENTAL BEEN TO ALLOW WHAT HAPPENED THIS SUMMER TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE QUESTIONS WERE SELECTED. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAKE CLOSENESS GONZALEZ I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ACTUALLY WHEN THESE TYPES OF WEAPONS ARE DEPLOYED IT ACTUALLY ESCALATES THE VIOLENCE SO TO SUGGEST THAT THESE ARE USED TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE WOULD BE COUNTERINTUITIVE. AND THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH. VIOLENCE ARE HOW HOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING INJURED BY THE USE OF THESE LEFT LESS THAN WE LEGAL. LESS THAN LETHAL WEAPONS BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN GET HAVE THAT DATA THAT IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THIS BILL AS WELL. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THIS. A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE THIS SUMMER HAVE BEEN. PERMANENTLY MAIMED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT SHOW UP AT THE PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION THAT THAT MAYBE GOT TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND INVOICE THEIR THEIR RIGHT TO TAKE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT IN THE SYSTEM BUT THEY FELT HURT BY. THAT AS SOMEBODY WHO FROM THE DAY MY KIDS WERE BEING HELD HAVE TAKEN THEM TO PROTESTS HAVE TAKEN THEM TO ACTIONS. IT IS EXTREMELY SCARY TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED THE SUMMER TO INNOCENT BYSTANDERS NOT PEOPLE WHO WERE SHOOTING AT THE POLICE BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE TO EXPRESS THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. WE HAVE TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ANYONE WHO HAS. A SUGGESTION I HAVE TAKEN EVERY MEETING I WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE EVERY MEETING- WITH ANY SECTORS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT I HAVE AND I MADE CHANGES THAT. YOU KNOW THEY ASK FOR SO AT THIS POINT I JUST THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT- STANDARD THAT WE NEED TO SET IN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ANYONE WHO WANTS TO WORK. WITH ME ON. THANK YOU- BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS VERY- SENSITIVE ISSUE. BUT. IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- WHEN I WAS A YOUNG REGGIE JONES SAWYER LIVING IN LOS ANGELES. WITH A POLICE CHIEF NAMED DARYL GATES. WHO SAID THAT USING A CHARCOAL. WAS AN APPROPRIATE WAY. TO DEFEND FOR POLICE OUT TO DEFEND HIMSELF THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN WHO DIE BECAUSE YOU HAD A CHIEF OF POLICE WHO BASICALLY SAID WE HAD AN ANATOMY. HE WANTED TO AND IF WE HAD AN ANATOMY. THAT CAUSED US TO DIE WHEN THEY DID THE CHUCKLE. AND COULDN'T SEE THE HUMANITY. N. A. A POLICE ACTION THAT RESULTED IN SOMEONE'S DEATH M. I HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THINK ABOUT THAT THAT WAS LIKE THE LATE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. I THINK MISTER GIBSON JUST HAD UP. WHAT YEARS IS TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FROM THE LATE EIGHTIES TOLD NOW THAT SOMEHOW WE STRUGGLED WITH IT. SO I COMMEND YOU FOR BRING IT HERE NOW BECAUSE- EVEN WITH THIS DISCUSSION. WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE DO AND WE SHOULDN'T TAKE. TWENTY THIRTY YEARS. TO SOLVE IT WE NEED TO SOLVE IT NOW- AND I KNOW. THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE USED TO TRAIN. THAT I WISH WERE BACK AT THE ACADEMY TRAINING PEOPLE ON THE USE. OF THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. D. E. DO YOU SPEND A TRAINEE AND HOW FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN READING. HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATE ENOUGH. MORE UPDATED. TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE STANDARDS- SO THAT BOTH SIDES ARE SAFE AND BOTH SIDES UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- AND THAT BOTH SIDES UNDERSTAND DE ESCALATION. AND HOW TO WORK BECAUSE CHANGE OBVIOUS CHANGED A LOT FROM WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT USED TO SIX GERMAN SHEPHERDS ON MY PEOPLE. IT'S CHANGED THAT STORE FIRE HOSES. ON BLACK PEOPLE IT'S CHANGED CHANGED DRAMATICALLY AND THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY BACKED ON. WHEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL SIDES. TO SIT AND TALK ABOUT WAYS WE CAN KEEP EVERYBODY SAFE. BUT REALLY UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES. ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT- YOU PROBABLY CAN HEAR MY VOICE HOW EMOTIONAL YOU CAN GET WITH THIS WHATEVER SIDE YOU'RE ON. AND- OUR OPTION RECOMMENDING AND I BOTH I RECOMMEND BECAUSE IT. HOPEFULLY WE CAN RISKS WE RESOLVE IT NOW. OR AT LEAST START THE FIRST STEPS OF IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BUILD ON TO MAKE IT BETTER AND BETTER AND IF WE NEED MORE MONEY. FOR TRAINING- THE CHAIR APPROPRIATIONS OFFICE ACROSS THE HALL FROM ME. AND I'M SURE. I SHOULD OWN BUDGET FIVE I'M SURE WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PROPERLY TRAINED SO WE DON'T HAVE THESE MISHAPS AGAIN AND IF PEOPLE DON'T COME OUT INJURED RIGHT NOW YOU'RE IN A WHICH- GOD FOR BID WE HAVE MULTIPLE DEATHS. AFTER THIS IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING NOW IT COULD ESCALATE TO THAT AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE AGAIN ON BOTH SIDES SOMEONE GETS HURT THEY GET MAD THEN ONE SIDE. GOES AFTER THE OTHER AND NOW WE DO HAVE A FULL FLEDGE PROBLEMS SO. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US HERE. IT IS IF I CAN'T I JUST AGAIN WHEN I APOLOGIZE TO MR LACKEY I THINK HE KNOWS I HAVE A DEEP RESPECT- FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT DESPITE ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE FACES AND I'VE ALWAYS HAD EIGHTY EIGHT VERY WORKABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE TRIED TO WORK ON THIS BILL WITH IT SO I DIDN'T MEAN TO IN ANY WAY. OFFEND YOU OR YOUR PREVIOUS CAREER OR ANYWAY I MEAN THIS IS IT WAS JUST. I THIS SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT THAT DISCUSSION IS. I USUALLY DON'T LET PEOPLE TALK AFTER I'M SORRY BUT- THANK YOU FOR. FOR YOUR POLICY. I THINK THAT'S HOPEFULLY IT'S A- IT IT STILL NEED OF. A MOTION AND A SECOND. START MISTER MISTER CLARK MOVED THIS WEEK SECOND. AB FORTY EIGHT BY SEVEN MEMBER GONZALEZ THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY LACKEY NO BARRICADE CAN BARRICADE HAD HI CORK CORK AYE SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I SAY OUR TO SEE OUR TONO WICKS WICKS HI LI. LEE HIGH THAT MISSION THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU. FULL. MISTER AB TWENTY SIX POLICE OFFICERS USE OF FORCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. READ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANTED TO NOTE UP FRONT IF I COULD THE- ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE APPRECIATION I HAVE FOR- YOUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT IN THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEES- CONSULTANT- AND I'VE DECIDED AS THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT I'M REMOVING ACCESSORY TO A CRIME HAS A PROVISION THAT WAS INITIALLY PART OF THIS BILL AND THAT COMES WITH HAVING HAD CONVERSATIONS MUCH IS WHAT WAS EXPRESSED- AND OPPRESSED THEN THE PREVIOUS- BILL DISCUSSION I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THOSE KIND OF DISCUSSIONS AND- AS A RESULT WE WILL REMOVE. EXCESS RETURN CRIME. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX. A BILL THAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL MEASURES THAT ESTABLISH TWO THINGS. ONE WHAT IT MEANS FOR PEACE OFFICER TO INTERVENE WHEN WITNESSING AN EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE BY ANOTHER PEACE OFFICER. AND TO CERTAIN OUTCOMES FOR FAILURE TO INTERVENE. MEMBERS WE WERE ALL JUST MADE BY THE TRAGIC EVENTS THAT LED TO THE UNTIMELY DEATH. OF GEORGE FLOYD. AND TO THEIR CREDIT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE CONDEMNED THE ACTIONS OF THE SUPERVISING OFFICER INVOLVED IN THAT INCIDENT. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN THE DAYS WEEKS AND MONTHS FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC EVENT THAT THE PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WE WITNESSED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WE'RE NOT SINGULARLY FOCUS ON JUST THE ACTIONS OF THE SUPERVISING OFFICER. NO THE DEMONSTRATORS WERE ALSO PROTESTING THE FACT THAT THREE ADDITIONAL OFFICERS SIMPLY STOOD BY AND WATCHED HIM DIE. THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. CURRENT LAW IS WRITTEN SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT IT OFFICER HAS A DUTY TO INTERVENE. HOWEVER THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOTHING IN CURRENT LAW EXPLAINS OR ESTABLISHES NGUYEN IN FACT THE PEACE OFFICER HAS INTERVENE. ABSENT OF THIS UNDERSTAND IT IT LEAVES THE PUBLIC UNINFORMED AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THE ABILITY TO DEFINE. INTERVENTION AS WHATEVER EACH INDIVIDUAL PIECE OFFICER DEEMS AS APPROPRIATE. FOR THESE REASONS I PUT FORWARD ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX. AB TWENTY SIX CLARIFIES AND ESTABLISHES INTERVENTION OR INTERCEDE TO INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE OF DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES CONFRONTING THE OFFICER APPLYING EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE PHYSICALLY STOPPING THE EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE WHEN IN A POSITION TO DO SO. RECORDING AND DOCUMENTING THE INCIDENT IN REAL TIME WITH THE BODY KAMMLER KAMMER AND REPORTING THE INCIDENT TO DISPATCH OR WATCH COMMANDER IN REAL TIME STATING THE OFFENDING OFFICER'S NAME. UNIT LOCATION TIME AND SITUATION IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH IN AN ATTEMPT TO INTERVENE HAS BEEN MAY. ADDITIONALLY IT REQUIRES A PEACE OFFICER TO REPORT THE INCIDENT IMMEDIATELY TO HIS OR HER SUPERVISOR. AB TWENTY SIX PROHIBITS RETALIATION ON A PEACE OFFICER FOR REPORTING THE INCIDENT. IT WAS AN OFFICER FROM TRAINING FOR OTHER OFFICERS FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE THAT AN EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE COMPLAINT IS SUBSTANTIATED. AND IF THE INVESTIGATION BY THE PEACE OFFICERS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY FINDS. THAT THE PEACE OFFICER EITHER USE EXCESSIVE FORCE THAT RESULTED IN GREAT BODILY INJURY OR DEATH OF A MEMBER OFTHE PUBLIC. OR FAIL TO INTERVENE IN THAT INCIDENT CAN BE DISQUALIFIED FROM BEING A PEACE OFFICER. ALL DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND POKE BAR OR POLICE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS. ARE PRESERVED IN THIS BILL. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE PUT FORWARD IN THIS BILL FOR ESTABLISHING THAT AN OFFICER HAS INTERVENE CAN ACTUALLY BE APPLIED IN REAL WORLD SCENARIOS MY OFFICE REACHED OUT TO POST. WHO WAS CHARGED TO DEVELOP DUTY TO INTERVENE TRAINING. AND OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE LIAISONS PROPOSED WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT DUTY TO INTERVENE TRAINING AND ALL OF THE FEDERAL STATE AND STATE LAWS ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE TO INTERVENE. IS AN ALL OF THE USE OF FORCE TRAININGS. IT IS IN THE ACADEMY AS WELL AS IN SERVICE TRAINING AND RECENTLY THE COMMISSION MANDATED USE OF FORCE TRAINING AS A PERISHABLE SKILL WHICH MAKES IT REQUIRED TRAINING FOR EVERY IN SERVICE OFFICER EVERY TWO YEARS. IN FACT POST HAS PURCHASED FIVE MILLION IN NEW TECHNOLOGY FOUR HUNDRED VIRTUAL REALITY SIMULATORS THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY OFFER A SIMULATOR USE OF FORCE DE ESCALATION COURSE THAT LITERALLY PRACTICES INTERVENTION. AND INTERVENTION TECHNIQUES AND SCENARIOS MEMBERS THIS IS A BILL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND REESTABLISHING PUBLIC TRUST BY EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY ON THE LAWFUL PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES OF PEACE OFFICERS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY HAVE IN FACT ATTEMPTED TO INTERVENE TO STOP EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE. AB TWENTY SIX SIMPLY CODIFIES WHAT IS LITERALLY BEING STALKED AS WE SPEAK. IN THAT SPIRIT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME- TO TESTIFY TODAY IS BRIAN **** WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. AND BETTY WILLIAMS WITH THE CALIFORNIA HAWAII STATE CONFERENCE AND UNLESS IT. THANK YOU.

MOST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING THE STATE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORTED S. B. TWO THIRTY AND REMOVED ITS OPPOSITION TO AB THREE NINETY TWO BASED ON THE FINAL AGREED UPON VERSIONS OF THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW. AB TWENTY SIX HOWEVER HAD SIGNIFICANT NEW REQUIREMENTS TO THE USE OF FORCE POLICY PROVISIONS THAT FORM THE BASIS OF THIS COMPROMISE ON SB TWO THIRTY MAYBE THREE NINETY TWO. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THE USE OF FORCE POLICY REQUIRE OFFICERS TO IMMEDIATELY. REPORT POTENTIAL EXCESSIVE FORCE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY REQUIRING OFFICERS TO INTERCEDE IN THE USE OF FORCE. IT OFFICER REQUIRED TO REPORT THE USE OF POTENTIAL EXCESSIVE FORCE BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO STOP IT. ADDITIONALLY AS B. TWO THIRTIES PROVISION REGARDING OFFICERS NEEDED INTERCEDING KNOWLEDGES THE POSSIBILITY THAT OTHER OFFICERS MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

AND BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND MISTER CORK I THINK IS THE FIRST QUESTION- MOVE THE BILL- SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I THINK WE ABSOLUTELY NEED A WAY TO DECERTIFY POLICE OFFICERS WE DON'T HAVE A- AND THIS WOULD GIVE US THAT OPPORTUNITY- SECOND. OF SOME OF THE OBJECTIONS- OF THE OPPOSITION IN PARTICULAR- YOU'VE ALREADY CONCEDED- ON THEM YOU SAID THAT WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PUNISH THE OBSERVING OFFICER. SO I HAVE I HOPE THEY LISTEN MORE CAREFULLY TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. THIS IS SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTELY NEED AND I WOULD JUST SAY TO THE OPPOSITION. UP PLEASE FIND A WAY TO WORK WITH MR HOLDEN ON THIS. I'LL ALSO NOTE THAT WELL YOU'VE OBJECTED THAT THIS IS A NEW DETERMINATION OF EXCESSIVE FORCE THIS IS IN A VERY SHORT DIFFERENT SITUATION. THEN THE BILL THAT WE PASSED- TWO YEARS AGO. AND SO WE NEED A DEFINITION NOW IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT PLEASE WORK WITH MR HOLDEN I'M HOPING WE CAN- WELL WE WILL PASS A BILL LIKE THIS AND PLEASE DON'T BE LEFT BEHIND. PLEASE HELP US MAKE IT A GOOD BILL THANK YOU. MR LEE. SEVERAL THAT WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS CONVERSATION IS- I DEFINITELY WELL I HEARD OF THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS AND I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION BELIEVES IN GIVING SECOND CHANCES TO PEOPLE THAT DEBTS UP DID SOMETHING DECADES AGO- I DON'T WHEN I READ THE BILL I DON'T SEE IT AS RETROACTIVE A FIRE TRUCK TO USE THAT IS THAT'S TRUE IT IS IT IS NOT RETROACTIVE BUT ALL RIGHT RIGHT WELL I DO AND I ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM A STELLAR RECORD I DO HOPE THAT THEY WILL. COME TO A MIDDLE GROUND WITH YOU BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE GIVEN VERY CONSERVATORY AND MAKING CHANGES THAT MAKE SENSE TO IT. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AS WELL. IN OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER. HOLD UP WELL THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE. THE MEMBERS F THE COMMITTEE WITH THEIR THEIR COMMENTS THAT SORT OF. WAS WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THE TALKS ABOUT RETROACTIVITY- BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE'S A NEED. TO DO SOMETHING. AND WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO IN THE PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THIS BILL WHEN WE INITIATED IN THE SENATE. AT THE END OF LAST SESSION- TO NOW- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE TRYING TO HEAR WHAT THE CONCERNS WERE. VERY ENERGETIC INDICATED THAT- THERE NEEDED TO BE SOME- ADDRESSING. A RETALIATION. THAT WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INSERTION INTO THIS BILL. I AGREED WITH IT. HAD MADE ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD. WE REMOVED WHEN THERE WAS CONCERN- OF PUBLIC INTERNET WEBSITES. WE TOOK THAT OUT OF THE BILL. WE REMOVE THE REVISION THAT WAS PUT IN. THE PREVIOUS BILL- IN THE- IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON. A REVISED DEFINITION OF THIS. OF NECESSITY. WE TOOK THAT OUT OF THE BILL- AND AS IT. RELATES TO THE MOST CURRENT- REMOVAL. THE ACCESSORY TO A CRIME. WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN THAT OUT- THE BILL. PRESERVES AND OFFICERS RIGHT TO PETITION- THEIR EMPLOYMENT AGENCY- DURING THE INVESTIGATION TO INDICATE. AND SHOW EVIDENCE WHY THEY DID INTERCEDE AND SO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT AND EVEN IF THEY DON'T AGREE. AND THE AGENCY DECIDES THAT THEY DID NOT INTERCEDED EVIDENCE THAT THEY PRESENTED WAS NOT SUFFICIENT. THEY STILL HAVE A RIGHT TO CHALLENGE APPROPRIATELY AT THE NEXT LEVEL- SO THAT THEY ALWAYS HAVE PRESERVED THEIR RIGHTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD- I JUST THINK THE COMMITTEE AGAIN I THINK OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THAT THE CHEER FOR YOUR- HEARING THIS BILL I THINK IT IS A VERY TIMELY INAPPROPRIATE AND I. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVALS. HOW CAN I ALSO BUT I WILL CONTINUE MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN. SO I'M WILLING TO HEAR ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND THOUGHTS ON THIS BILL FROM THE OPPOSITION TO CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES ALONG THE WAY. GEN OKAY SO MR HOLDEN- I PROBABLY NO BETTER NAME ANYBODY ELSE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS. TO WORK. THROUGH THESE DAYS DIFFICULT ISSUE- I DO HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO. FOUR MISTER SHERMAN AND MR CELL THE FELLOW- IF THEY'RE STILL ON THE LINE. YES MISTER. SO YOU HERE MR THANK YOU YOU HEAR MR HOLDEN. REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE LAW ENFORCEMENT BETTER. AND I'M NOT JUMPING ON LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW MR HOLDEN EYES ELECTED OFFICIALS AND EVERYBODY OVER HERE NOT EVERYONE DOESN'T ELECTED OFFICIAL. I HAVE HAD IMPECCABLE BOB. CAREERS YOU KNOW IF YOU SAY THE WORD SHRIMP OR SHRIMP OR SHRIMP GATE WE'VE WE'VE HAD OUR OWN. THAT WE HAD TO CLEAN UP. AND WE'VE HAD PEOPLE WHO'VE DONE SOME MEAT TO STUFF. THAT WE HAD TO CLEAN UP OUR HOUSE. AND SO WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO ASK. LAW ENFORCEMENT. HOW DO YOU HELP US BECAUSE YOU'LL GET A BILL LIKE THIS EVERY TIME IF YOU DON'T HELP US HELP YOU. MEETING UP HOW DO WE GET RID OF. WHITE RACIST SUPREMACIST WHO ARE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS ALL THIS IS GETTING PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NEVER BEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND YOU MAY I'M UNION BACK YOU MAY HAVE A- A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT. AND REPRESENT THEM. BUT THEY'RE THE ONES THAT WEEK BY WEEK MONTH BY MONTH IT MAKES IT REALLY HARD. FOR US TO DEFEND YOU TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. EVERY DAY WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS MR HOLDEN IS MAKING A VALIANT EFFORT. AND I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE LAW ENFORCEMENT BETTER THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RECRUIT MORE. MINORITIES AND INDIVIDUALS IS WITH LAWS LIKE THIS WERE YOU ALLOWED. THIS BILL REALLY JUST ALLOW YOU. TO BE ABLE TO ROOT OUT THE BAD ELEMENTS. BETTER LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW. THIS WITH THIS LOT THAT. AND IT PROTECTS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BRAVE ENOUGH. AND GUTSY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT THE FEAR OF RETALIATION. OR THE CAREER STEIN. THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS START STEP PROCESS. AND SO IF THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TO READ OUT THE BAD ELEMENT. AND I'LL SAY IT ON HERE. THAT MIGHT BE 1% OR LESS BUT THAT 1% IT'S KILLING YOU SO WHAT CAN YOU. RECOMMEND TO MR HOLDEN. THAT WILL HELP US GET TO A PLACE. WHERE TRUST. AND I USED TO WORK FOR YOUR HONOR IT BECAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BEFORE. MMHM BUT WHEN PEOPLE OF COLOR I'M MORE AFRAID OF BEING INCARCERATED. OR DEPORTED. BY PEOPLE WEAR BADGES THAT'S A PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO CORRECT IT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO CORRECT IT SO THAT ALL OUR COMP COMMUNITIES NOT ONLY FEEL SAFE BUT WE CAN WE MOVE FORWARD. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS. OF HOW TO ROOT OUT INDIVIDUALS WHO PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH SCREENING WE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH- EVALUATIONS OR MAYBE THEY WERE JUST TOO YOUNG OR MAYBE NOT. BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE IT WHAT CAN WE DO OTHERWISE FOR TO KEEP COMING BACK WITH THE FIXES THAT WE BELIEVE. WE'LL MAKE LAW ENFORCEMENT BETTER. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYTHING. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T EVEN GET MORE IN A LOT WHEN YOU WHEN YOUR OFFICERS ASSEMBLY REALLY HORRENDOUS. LIKE A MISTER FLOYD SNACK. I'M HEARING THAT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO STOP. WELL MISTER FLOYD WAS IT WHEN HE STARTED CRYING FOR HIS MOTHER. WHEN IT WAS. WHEN THE AFTER HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKET AND HAD HIS KNEE ON HIS NECK. WHEN IT WHEN DO YOU AS A AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. THAT'S WHY THE DID THE STANDARD IS HIGHER. BECAUSE YOU'RE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER YOU'RE NOT SOME KID JOY RIDE IN A CAR. THAT'S UNDER AGE THE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK THEY'RE DOING. YOU ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED OFFICERS. THEY SHOULD KNOW WHEN. ANOTHER OFFICER IS PUTTING SOME ONE IN DANGER YOU GO TO DEVELOP DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS YOU SEE THIS ALL THE TIME. SO I BELIEVE I DO YOU NEED MORE TRAINING. OR WE NEED TO REALLY HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT. HOW MUCH PROTECTION DO YOU NEED TO GO TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO REALLY SHOULDN'T BE OFFICERS ANYMORE. THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT AND WE HAVE ENOUGH RESEARCH. HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THIS COMMITTEE TO SHOW. THAT DESTRUCTION ARE FOR EVERYBODY REALLY IT IS A HARD JOB. AND I WILL ADMIT IT EVERY DAY IS PROBABLY IF NOT THE HARDEST JOB YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE IS VERY DIFFICULT SO MR HOLDEN'S BILL IS ALLOWING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE A DRASTIC CHANGE. I KNOW YOU TRIED IT BY THE BALLOT IT'S LIKE THE BALLOT IN THE BILL HE TRIED BY THE BALLOT. IT DIDN'T WORK. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WANT YOU TO CHANGE PROP 47-57. AND IN MAY BE DOWN. ALL THE CHANGES YOU WANT LAST YEAR. AND EVEN ELECTED FOLK THAT YOU PROBABLY WON'T AGREE WITH YOU STILL FIGHTING WITH. BUT THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT AT THE BALLOT. AND PUTTING TARGETS ON ELECTED OFFICIALS. BY PUTTING TARGETS ON BLACK PEOPLE'S BACK YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO WIN THEM OVER. AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. TO CHANGE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAVE IT'S GOING. IT'S HAPPENING NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO TO ANY OF US. THE WAVE IS HERE IT'S HAPPENING AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT EXCEPT. EITHER PARTICIPATE IN IT. FOR THE DEFECTS OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THINGS THAT YOU WON'T LIKE. AND WE WILL GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT. WE WILL SO WE NEED YOUR HELP MR HOLD I KNOW IT'S A VERY LONG SPEECH WERE ARE A QUESTION THAT I HAVE FOR MISTER SHERMAN MYSELF STILL. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS. ON HOW TO HELP MR HOLDEN. READ THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. LEICESTERSHIRE'S THIS COURSE THE STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WERE MORE THAN WILLING TO CONTINUE SPEAKING WITH- THE AUTHOR AND THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL- WE RAISED SIMILAR OBJECTIONS TO THE BILL LAST YEAR WHICH ULTIMATELY DIDN'T MOVE- AGAIN NOTED WITH APPRECIATION THE REMOVAL OF THE LANGUAGE ON THE ACCESSORY- AND I WILL ALSO TELL YOU SORT OF. INDEPENDENT I GUESS RELATEDLY TO THIS BILL THAT- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE NOTION OF SOME TYPE OF SYSTEM OF YOU KNOW DECERTIFICATION ARE AS YOU SAID GETTING RID OF THE BAD APPLES WHO SHOULD NOT BE PEACE OFFICERS BUT WE'RE WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT IDEA WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH- BOTH SIDES IN BOTH HOUSES SINCE LAST YEAR ON TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S AGREEABLE THAT WORKS- WE COULDN'T CROSS THE FINISH LINE LAST YEAR- BUT WE ARE. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT- IN IN SOME FORM OR FASHION TO FIND A WAY WHERE MANAGEMENT- I'LL JUST SPEAK FROM A MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE CAN ADDRESS THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE ARE OFFICERS. WHO ARE ACTING OUTSIDE OF THE LAW ARE ACTING OUTSIDE OF THE POLICY BECAUSE FRANKLY IT'S DIFFICULT A LOT OF TIMES AND I DON'T WANT TO TURN THIS INTO A LABOR RELATIONS MANAGEMENT OR MANAGEMENT VERSUS LABOR ISSUE BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE CHALLENGES- WIND THERE ARE FOLKS WHO SHOULDN'T BE PEACE OFFICERS AND YES THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR. DUE PROCESS AND THAT SHOULD BE OBSERVED BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT- THE STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE IN THAT THAT MANY OTHER AUTHORS AND PROPONENTS OF HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT IN TERMS OF- CHANGE AND AGAIN SO I WOULD JUST REITERATE THAT WE ARE. SUPPORTIVE OF THE NOTION OF- AS AS OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS ARE WILL SPEAK FOR THEM- BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE IS AN EFFORT ONGOING TO ADDRESS THAT THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR- I WOULD JUST NOTE ARE. YOU KNOW MORE OF THIS QUESTION OF YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY REPORT. THE EXCESSIVE FORCE AND THEN YOU MUST INTERCEDE AGAIN WHICH HAVE FIRST WHICH CALL. FOR THAT AND MAYBE IT'S JUST SOME CLARIFICATION THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE BUT IT'S NO REALLY. AND THEN FRANKLY- LANGUAGE THAT EXPRESSES THE NOTION OF. WHEN ANOTHER OFFICER ARRIVED ON THE SCENE THAT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE FACTS IN HAND OF AN OFFICER WHO'S BEEN THERE LONGER THAT WAS CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED LANGUAGE. NOT MINUTES BEING REMOVED BY THIS BILL SO THERE'S SOME SPECIFIC THINGS BUT AGAIN GENERALLY TO YOUR POINT MISTER CHAIR- WERE PLEASED TO CONTINUE SPEAKING NOT ONLY ABOUT THIS BILL BUT ON THE REFORM EFFORTS GENERALLY. IN OUR AND I WOULD ALSO HOMES CARE ABOUT GOING WITH. CORY I WAS. TRYING CHAMBER WHAT THE REVELATION OF THE NATION'S- OF HELLO TO ACTUALLY ECHO. LARGELY THE COMMENT- MICHAEL TO OUTDOOR- WE ARE ALSO- INTERESTED IN NOT HAVING A BAD COPS AMONG OUR RANKS ACROSS OF THE FORTUNE- BECAUSE WITH. ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS AND THAT THE ASSOCIATION WERE REQUIRED BY LAW TO. DEFEND THEM- SO WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING BAD COPS AND I THINK WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER HALL ON- DEFINITELY THE DISSERTATION- OR OPEN TO IT. AND WE'D LOVE TO- WORK WITH THE. AUTHOR AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. HELLO THE POINT I'M MAKING IS. WE NEED YOUR HELP TO GET THIS DONE. YOU KNOW I'M A CITY EMPLOYEE FORMER CITY MANAGER AND SEE LOS ANGELES I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FAR. SOMEONE WAS CIVIL SERVICE STATUS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. AND SO I GET I GET THAT. BUT IF YOU PUT IN THE WORK YOU CAN GET PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE WORKING FOR GOVERNMENT OUT OF THEM- ALI ONE OF THE PROUDEST. TIMES SINCE I'VE BEEN CHEERS COMMITTEE HAD BEEN WHEN MY OWN POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE- DENOUNCED. BABCOCK'S I DON'T SEE A LOT WITH THE OTHER ASSOCIATIONS ON HERE. I DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE GANGS. DARREN A LAD SIN L. A. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. I DON'T SEE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU GONNA GET RID OF THEM. AS YOU DEFENDING SO WHEN YOU COME TO US AND TELL US. THAT YOU. WANT TO HELP. BUT YOU BRING ME BILLS ON THIS COMMITTEE EVERY DAY TO PUT MORE BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS IN JAIL BUT YOU'RE NOT PREMIUM NOT ONE. BILL TO HELP US GET RID OF BAD COPS. DAY YOU DO THAT THE DAY YOU HELP MR HOLDEN. WILL BE THE DAY. THAT YOU'LL GET THE FAITH OF THE COMMUNITY BACK AGAIN. THE AND IF IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT ALL COPS BEEN AS A UNION I GET THAT BUT YOU NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT AND NOT SAY YOU'RE DOING ONE THING AND ANOTHER I'VE LOOKED AT YOU GUYS SHIP YOUR HANDS YOU PROMISED ME YOU WOULD WORK ON PROP FORTY SEVEN FIXES IN FIFTY SEVEN FIXES. INSTEAD TURN AROUND TRY TO KILL. SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO. AND IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE GENUINE ABOUT IT WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS. WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE WHO TOOK AMENDMENTS THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE. HE'S TRYING TO WORK WITH YOU. AND THEN YOU COME HERE IN MASS. AND TRY TO KILL THE BILL. DOES NOT RIGHT. SO IT'S JUST IT IS TIME THAT WE STOP THIS FARCE AND REALLY TRY TO MAKE. REALLY TRY TO GET RID LAW ENFORCEMENT START HAVING PEACE OFFICERS JUST WANNA SEE YOU GOTTA STOP BEING LAW ENFORCEMENT BE PEACE OFFICERS SO WHEN YOU COME TO SEE. YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. THEN PUTTING PEOPLE DOWN HURTING THEM. SO I'M NOT SURE COULD THIS. I WANT THIS BILL TO GET THROUGH BUT MOST IMPORTANT I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. TO MAKE IT WORK FOR BOTH SIDES. CHEERS RECOMMENDED I GO. ON AB TWENTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS A MANAGE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY. OUR CAN. CORK HI QUIRK I SANTIAGO. C. R. TO SAY OUR TURN NOW WICKS. LEE AT LI I. IT MEASURES ON CALL TALK THANK YOU RESEARCHER YOUR. MISTER KALRA. AB TWO FIVE SIX CAR CRIMINAL. PROCEDURE DISCRIMINATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. DESPITE PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE IS CHALLENGING YOUR CALIFORNIA'S GLOBAL TO PASS SOME OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS IS LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND AS THE WORLD WITNESSED THE KILLING AND TORTURE GEORGE FORMER POLICE OFFICERS. THE SET IN MOTION A MOVEMENT FOR RACIAL JUSTICE THAT UNDOUBTEDLY. GOVERNORS ARE NEED TO READ OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OF THE ILLS. OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. AMONG THESE CALLS A CALIFORNIA ACIAL JUSTICE ACT WAS HISTORIC. IT WAS A PROFOUND STEP FORWARD IN ADDRESSING INSTITUTIONALIZED IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS IN OUR CRIMINAL COURTS BY EMPOWERING DEFENDANTS TO OBJECT OBJECTIVE CHARGES CONVICTIONS OR PUNISHMENTS. BASED UPON RACE ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. THE ACT OVERTURNED A MORE THAN THIRTY YEAR LEGAL PRECEDENT ESTABLISHED IN THE CASE OF THE KLASKY B. CAMP. KNOWN AS THE MCCLUSKY DECISION THE US SUPREME COURT. HAD FOR TOO LONG REQUIRED THE ACCUSED IN CRIMINAL CASES TO PROVE INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION WHEN CHALLENGING RACIAL BIAS IN THE LEGAL PROCESS. THIS INSISTENCE ON PROOF OF INTENTIONAL OR PURPOSEFUL DISCRIMINATION. ESTABLISH A LEGAL STANDARD THAT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET. IN A DISSENT JUSTICE WILLIAM BRENNAN WROTE THAT THE DECISION WAS DRIVEN BY A FEAR OF TOO MUCH JUSTICE. THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THIS WIDELY CONDEMNED DECISION ALLOWED RACIAL DISCRIMINATION TO PERVADE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM UNCHECKED. IN SO DOING CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN SOME OF THE WORST RACIAL DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES IN THE COUNTRY. A BLACK PERSON'S OVER EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE INCARCERATED THAN A WHITE PERSON. THE PERSONALLY. THE CRIMES THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST DISPARITIES IN THE COUNTRY FAR WORSE THAN ANY SOUTHERN STATE. BUT YOU KNOW THE DEFENDANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CONVICTED OF BOTH THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE CONVICTED OR OTHER CASES. THIS MESSED. BLACK LATINO DEFENDANTS. OR MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE A FELONY VERSES MISTER CONVICTION ONE COMPARED TO WHITE DEFENDANTS BLACK MEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY OR 42% MORE LIKELY TO BE SENTENCED TO PRISON THAN A WHITE MAN CONVICTED OF A FELONY FILIPINO MAN CONVICTED OF A FELONY A 33% MORE LIKELY TO BE SENT TO PRISON. THIS TROUBLED HISTORY OF PROSECUTING AND INCARCERATING PEOPLE OF COLOR. ARE MUCH HIGHER REACH THE GENERAL POPULATION. NEEDS TO BE RECKONED WITH THE WE DID RECKON WITH IT LAST YEAR. AS WE PASS ON THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. HOWEVER THE APT APPLICATION OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW SHOULDN'T BE LIMITED. TO THE ACCUSED WHO HAPPEN TO BE TRIED CONVICTED. AND SENTENCED IN THE CRIMINAL COURTS AFTER JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THAT IS WHY RETROACTIVE RELIEF IN THE CALIFORNIA RACIAL JUSTICE ACT SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO ALL. THOSE WITH PAST INJUSTICES. AB TWO FIVE SIX IS THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT FOR ALL OF THE GRANT DOES THE JUDGMENTS RENDERED PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TO USE THE PROTECTIONS OF THE ACT. TO PETITION THE COURT TO SEEK POTENTIAL REMEDY INVOLVING A RACIAL BIAS IN THEIR CASE. ADDITIONALLY AB TWO FIFTY SIX MAKES A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL NON SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO THE ACT. THE REQUESTED A PERSON IF THEY DEMONSTRATE THE RACISM TAINTED THEIR TRIAL. MAY SEEK A RETRIAL RESENTENCING THIS BILL DOES NOT RELEASE PEOPLE OR GUARANTEE AN EARLIER PAROLE DAY. THE WITH PRIOR BIASED CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES DESERVE EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW AND IT'S AND IT'S A COMMON SAYS IT'S A COMMONSENSE RECOGNITION. OF HOW UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. TO PROVE RACIAL BIAS WAS A FACTOR IN THE CASE. ADDITIONALLY PROVIDING A MECHANISM FOR RETROACTIVE RELIEF WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO REALIZE SIGNIFICANT CORRECTIONAL SAVINGS. COLLEAGUES I'M IMMENSELY PROUD OF THE WORK WE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE NOT STOP UNTIL EVERYONE IS AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY. TO PURSUE EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. TO ILLUSTRATE WHY WE NEED THE RACES JUST SUCK FOR ALL YOU'LL HEAR FROM WITNESSES WITH FAMILY THAT ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED WITH LIVED EXPERIENCES OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. FOR WHICH RACE PLAYED A FACTOR. JOY RODRIGUEZ BROTHER HUGO CHAVEZ WHO IS CURRENTLY IN PRISON AND FIGHTING THE CASE AN APPELLATE COURT AND ME GO MAKE THEM SON OF. OF MAKE MICHAEL MCCANN WHO IS ALSO CURRENTLY INCARCERATED OR PROSECUTORS WERE ABLE TO USE RACIAL UNDERTONES THE CASE.

UNCHECKED RACIAL BIAS FROM PROSECUTOR AND LAW ENFORCEMENT GAME EXPERTS DURING TRIAL LET YOU GO BEING FOUND GUILTY OF A MURDER HE DID NOT COMMIT. AND RESULT IN A SENTENCE OF A HUNDRED AND FIVE YEARS TO LIFE. I ASKED THE COMMITTEE SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE FROM THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH- HE WOULD BE ON THE DEPEND. ON NUMBER ONE THE PROSECUTOR. WHO USED ASPECTS OF LOCAL CULTURE AND GANG ACTIVITY INTERCHANGEABLY WHICH CREATOR RACIAL BIAS AGAINST YOU GOING YOUNG HISPANIC MALES. NUMBER TWO THE DA EXPLICITLY USE THE TERMS TO FEDEX REGAIN MEMBERS CONTINUALLY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL SO SEATING GANG ACTIVITY WHICH I QUOTE A PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD.

THE JURY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A COMMUNITY ADVOCATE. AND MYSELF A HARD WORKING MAN THE ONLY TO HISPANIC MALE SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE WERE THERE TO HARPER THIS YEAR WENT ON TO SAY. AND I QUOTE I HAVE WILL BE TRIED TO LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE THING THE TERM HE'S ABSENT. AND I HAVE TO SAY CURTAIN HAS BEEN PULLED BACK ON A DIFFERENT POPULATION. THIS YEAR THIS JURY MEMBER REQUESTED THAT THE COURT REMOVED THE AUDIENCE FROM THE COURTROOM EXPRESSING CONCERNS OF. WALKING ALONE AFTER LEAVING THE COURTHOUSE AND THE OFFERING PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS ON NAMES AND WORKPLACE DURING JURY SELECTION. REPORT DID NOT ADDRESS MANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM THE OBVIOUS RACIAL BIAS BEHIND. THE JUROR'S CONCERNS THE FACT THANK. USED THE PROSECUTORS OFFICERS IN COURT.

WELL NOW GONNA GO TO OPPOSITION I HAVE A- LARRY MORSE THE SECOND CD EIGHT. ON THE PHONE EIGHTY ANTI HOPEFULLY. WE'RE GOOD NOW. CAN YOU HEAR ME I CAN CERTAINLY HEAR YOU YES DEFINITELY. THANK YOU SIR LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION LAST YEAR'S CDA A VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED THE PASSAGE OF AB. TWO FIVE FOUR TWO FOUR VERY SOUND. REASONS YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THAT OPPOSITION HOW RUTHLESS BILL DESPITE ITS MASSIVE IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY NEVER EVEN HAD A HEARING IN THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. NOW DESPITE MYRIAD AMBIGUITIES UNANSWERED QUESTIONS POSED BY EIGHTY TWO FIVE FOUR TWO WE ARE PRESENTED WITH AB TWO FIFTY SIX. WHICH PROPOSES TO MAKE ITS PROVISIONS RETROACTIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROPONENTS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED RETROACTIVE APPLICATION LAST YEAR. FOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS WE OPPOSED AB TWO FIVE FOUR TWO WE MUST ALSO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWO FIVE SIX WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S POLITICALLY UNPOPULAR TO OPPOSE A BILL THAT HAS GIVEN ITSELF THE NAME THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. BUT WE BELIEVE THE JUSTICE IT PURPORTS TO CREATE IS ILLUSORY AT BEST AND WILL ULTIMATELY COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO CREATE A FAIRER AND MORE EQUITABLE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY TWO ENDEAVOR TO CREATE A BOWL WORK DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM A GOLD WHOLEHEARTEDLY EMBRACED BY CDA. BUT IT DID SO IN A WAY THAT CREATED A TREMENDOUS RISK OF DENYING JUSTICE TO VICTIMS OF EVERY RACE ETHNICITY AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. LIKE INSTITUTING A SYSTEM THAT WOULD REVERSE THE CASE EVEN IF THERE WAS NO SHOWING THAT THE DEFENDANT. WAS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR TRIAL. FOR EXAMPLE. IF THERE IS A MASH ALONG OFFICER IN. IN THE CASE. ONLY WAS TO TAKE THE UNDISPUTED VIDEOTAPED STATEMENT FROM THE DEFENDANT. WHICH IS COVERED THAT OFFICER WAS DISCOVERED TO HARBOR BIASES AGAINST THE DEFENSE. THE BILL MANDATES THAT THE DEFENDANT'S CONVICTION WOULD HAVE TO BE REVERSED DESPITE THE FACT THAT FIFTY PEOPLE OBSERVE THE DEPENDENT SHOOTING AT HIS VICTIMS THE WITNESS OF BIAS WAS REVEALED TO THE JURY. THE WITNESS DID NOT EVEN TESTIFIED AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MURDERED BELONG TO THE SAME RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUP AS- AB TWO FIVE FOUR CREW WHICH AGAIN THIS BILL WOULD MAKE RETROACTIVE. IS SIMPLY RIDDLED WITH AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE INADEQUATE DEFINITIONS AND UNANSWERED LEGAL QUESTIONS. THE BILL WOULD OVERTURN A CONVICTION IF THE DEFENDANT WAS CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF A MORE SERIOUS OFFENSE NOT TO FIND. THE DEPENDENCE OF OTHER RACES ETHNICITIES OR NATIONAL ORIGINS WILL COMMIT SIMILAR OFFENSES. NOT DEFINED. AND ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED. NOT DEFINE IN THE- HOUSTON MORE FREQUENTLY SOUGHT VAGUELY DEFINED OR OBTAIN CONVICTIONS FOR MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES AGAINST PEOPLE WHO SHARE THE DEFENDANT'S RACE ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. THE VAGUE DEFINITION OF MORE FREQUENTLY SOUGHT OR OBTAINED OR MORE FREQUENTLY IMPOSED. I MEAN IF THE TYPICAL DATA DEMONSTRATES A QUOTE UNQUOTE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE COMPARATIVE GROUP. WHY IS THE DEFINITION OF SIGNIFICANT. THERE IS NOT THE 5% 10% FIFTY PERCENT- WALLY COULD ENTIRELY UP TO A JUDGE WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY GUYS EQUALLY TROUBLING THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY GUIDANCE AND ASSESSING THE RELEVANT PERIOD FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES IS IT FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT QUALIFIES AS A ORIGIN AGAIN THE LOG THIS BILL PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE TO DEPENDENCE CHARGED WITH THE SAME CRIME CAN BE OF THE SAME ETHNICITY BUT A DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT NATIONAL ORIGIN OR RACE OR BE OF THE SAME REYES BUT A DIFFERENT ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. WHICH IS THE RELEVANT GROUP FOR COMPARISON. NONE OF THESE COMP ISSUES HAVE YET BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE PUBLIC COURT IN THIS BILL SEEKS TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES RETROACTIVE- EVERY DEPENDENT BELONG TO AT LEAST ONE MORE RACIAL ETHNIC OR NATIONAL ORIGIN GROUPS. PRACTICALLY EVERY SINGLE CONVICTION THAT HAS EVER OCCURRED IN CALIFORNIA CAN NOW BE RE OPENED AND POTENTIALLY REVERSED DESPITE INDEPENDENT NOT HAVING BEEN DENIED A FAIR TRIAL BY ANY REALISTIC STAND. THE COST ESTIMATE OF THIS LAW IS INCALCULABLE AND THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR ANY REIMBURSEMENT TO THE COUNTIES FOR THE COSTS THEY WILL INCUR IN COMPLYING WITH THESE PROVISIONS. THERE WILL BE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PEELS THE WAY EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS AND TRIAL DELAYS BUT THE REAL COST WILL BE IN COMPLYING WITH THE DISCOVERY DEMANDS THAT THE BILL WILL CLOSE. BASED ON A RELATIVELY LOW THRESHOLD SHOWING AB TWO FIFTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE POLLING REVIEWING AND REDACTING FILES POTENTIALLY GOING BACK DECADES SINCE THE BILL SETS OUT NO TIME FRAMES OR LIMITS ON THE RELEVANT COMPARISON GROUPS. UNDER AB TWO FIFTY SIX DEFENDANTS WILL BE ABLE TO COMPEL LENGTHY AND COSTLY EVIDENTIARY HEARING INVOLVING THE TESTIMONY OF ATTORNEYS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS JUROR EXPERTS OR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BASED ON THE DEFENDANT SHOWING A MERE POSSIBILITY. THAT A VIOLATION OCCURRED. WE WOULD RESPECT URGE AUTHORED A TABLE DOES. UNTIL COLOR COURTS ARE ABLE TO OFFER SOME GUIDANCE REGRET REGARDING MANY OF ITS MOST POOREST PROVISIONS. WE REMAIN MORE THAN WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE PROPONENTS OF AB TWO FIFTY SIX TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE SHARED GOAL OF ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION AND A FAIRER AND MORE EFFECTIVE MANNER. IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE STRENUOUSLY OPPOSED TO AB TWO FIFTY SIX. AND ASK FOR A NOTEBOOK. THANK YOU MISTER MOORE. OTHER ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE AUDIENCE. BAYLOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE- IN THE ROOM. AND. ON THE PHONE. AT&amp;T ARE ANYWAY IF YOU WOULD LIKE ADDITION ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE ONE IN Q. BY ONE SIXTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. SURE MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WITH ASSOCIATE OUR POSITION WITH THE COMMENTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY- IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR COMMENT. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME GREAT THANK YOU WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE ANY QUESTIONS MR QUIRK. FIRST OF ALL MOVE THE BELL. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- BUT THIRD IN READING THE ANALYSIS THEY HAVE MANY CONCERNS ABOUT. SOME OF THE SAME THINGS THAT THE DA BROUGHT UP IN TERMS OF A DEFINITIONS AND I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD BE ADDRESSING ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AS YOU BRING THIS BILL FORWARD. YES YES AND- TO THOSE ISSUES AND BY THE WAY THE START OF A PHENOMENAL JOB ON THE ANALYSIS- A NUMBER OF THOSE ITEMS- THAT REQUIRE CLARITY OF WHAT WERE DRAWN FROM THIS REALLY PHENOMENAL SIXTY PAGE BRIEF DONE BY A RETIRED JUDGE AS COUSINS THEY WANT HAS HE'S PER TIME REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT- AND HE OFFERS SOME GUIDANCE ON THAT. AS WELL AND SO- WE ARE WORKING WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ON A DAILY ON THE LANGUAGE HOWEVER THAT WHATEVER CLARITY IS DEEMED NECESSARY. EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS WAS ABOUT K. I THINK I SAW HEAR THE CARE. THANK MISTER KALRA- AS YOU KNOW I SUPPORTED BILL LAST YEAR AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY AND- IN ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ACT IN THE JOB SYSTEM SOMETHING THAT IS. AS YOU MENTIONED YOUR OPENING SIGNIFICANTLY LACKING AND THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE U. S. JUSTICE SYSTEM PROVIDES FOR AN INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL TO COME BEFORE THE COURT AND BE HEARD AGAIN AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT IS. PART OF WHAT I THINK MAKES OUR SYSTEM SO ARTFUL IS THAT WE DON'T INCARCERATE PEOPLE NEVER LOOK BACK AND- AND SO YOUR EXTENDING THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN. POTENTIALLY IMPACTED BY BIAS AND A LACK OF JUSTICE I THINK IS REALLY WONDERFUL MY CONCERN YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE ARE GOING TO DO WITH THE CLARITY AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THAT MY CONCERN IS REALLY WITH- THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS AS MANY OF US KNOW THE COURTS ARE WERE OVERBURDENED PRIOR TO COPE ED AND HAVING A HARD TIME MEETING JUSTICE BECAUSE OF THAT. VAST NUMBER OF CASES BEFORE THEM THAT'S ONLY EXACERBATED WITH THE COVERED CRISIS BUT I DON'T EVEN AFTER WE GET THROUGH CO THAT I THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE OVERBURDENED COURTS. AND TO OPEN THIS UP AND WANTS TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON INCARCERATED IN CALIFORNIA WHO MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED BIAS. COULD POTENTIALLY OVERWHELM THE COURTS AND I UNDERSTAND THE STANDARDS ACTUALLY. ACHIEVE THE END RESULT IS HIGH BUT YOU MAY HAVE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WERE INCARCERATED THE FILE PETITIONS. WHICH THEN THEY DESERVE TO BE ANALYZED AND THOUGHTFULLY REVIEWED AND GIVEN THEIR MOMENT IN COURT. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THE COURT SYSTEM WOULD DO THAT IF WE WERE TO JUST OPEN THIS TO EVERY PERSON RETROACTIVELY AND I'M WONDERING. IF YOU'VE WORKED WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT ISSUE OR WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE. YEAH YOU KNOW THIS IS CERTAINLY A QUESTION OF THAT. WILL A PROPERLY BABY BOTTOM SURE IT- FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT I APPRECIATE YOU. RAISING THE ISSUE NOW OF CERTAINLY OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS. ON HOW WE MIGHT PHASE IN. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RETROACTIVITY SO AS NOT TO OVERBURDEN OUR COURT SYSTEM ONE THAT SPENT ELEVEN YEARS THE COURSE ON VERY SENSITIVE ESPECIALLY. TO THE RESOURCES THE DA'S PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND THE- COURT SYSTEM AS A WHOLE THE JUDGES HAVE. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RAISED BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS AS A POSSIBLE OFF POSSIBLE OPTION TO CONSIDER. AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE IT'S BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE SORT OF MAYBE SOME OF CONCORD TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE PHASE AND- SET UP. BUT PRIVATE PRIORITY NO COULD BE GIVEN. TO THOSE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED SO THE STATECAN REALIZE POTENTIAL CORRECTIONAL SAVINGS AS WELL. BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF. THE COMPONENTS OF. IT IN A LONG TERM OF THIS TYPE THE JUST IS THAT OF. WOULD SAVE MONEY BUT WE UNDER. IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT BUCKETS SO THE COURT SYSTEM HAVING TO HEAR CASES. IS A REAL. ISSUE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY SHORT ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY- IT IS AN ISSUE THAT THE THEY WERE ALSO TALKING USUALLY COUNCIL ABOUT. IN TERMS OF HOW WE SET UP THAT. SYSTEM SO AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER AND YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS ON THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT WE'LL WITH HOLD MY RIGHT TO CHANGE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR IF IT HAS AN ADDRESS AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT- AND JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO BE HER FOR THE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW JUST VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THE ISSUE OF HARBORING BIAS IN OFFICE ARE REVISED IN SPECIFIC CASES THE VICE S. B. EXISTS EXHIBIT TOWARDS THE DEFENDANT CAN BE SOME RANDOM ACT THAT'S NOT RELATED TO THE DEFENDANT BUT PUTTING THAT ASIDE- THE PROSECUTOR THE DA'S. PUTTING OUT HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THIS HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THAT WELL THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S A LOT. OF DIFFERENT STANDARDS OF PROOF. STANDARDS EVIDENCE WE DEAL WITH EVERY DAY IN THE COURT SYSTEM THERE WAS A POINT IN TIME. THAT THOSE DEFINITIONS HOW TO BE MORE FINE TUNED AND MORE AND BETTER DEFINED AND THEY CHANGE OVER TIME. BASED UPON- CASES ACTUALLY RUNNING THROUGH THE SYSTEM THE REALITY IS THAT. WHEN IT COMES THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S IT MAY BELIEVE. THAT OF ALL TO HOLD OFF A RETROACTIVE YOU WILL KNOW BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT. WE NEED TO HAVE THE STANDARDS- OF NOT ONLY IN PLACE TO ROOT OUT RACISM. A PARTICULARLY SYSTEMIC RACISM AND BIAS MY SYSTEM. BUT WE NEED TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE RE FULLY HEARD IN COURT. ULTIMATELY THERE WILL BE CASES WILL BE HEARD BY JUDGES AND DOES THEIR JOB THE APPELLATE COURTS. AND THE SUPREME COURT TO BETTER DEFINE AND GIVE MORE STRUCTURE- AND THE DA'S KNOW THAT- THAT THAT'S HOW. LANDMARK LEGISLATION. LANDMARK. POLICY LANDMARK DECISIONS. ARE SO. DEALT WITH BY FORWARD THE BOTTOM IS WHAT EVEN MORE PUT UP. THE OPPOSING OF CALLED RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. IS STANDING BY THE STATUS QUO THE LEASE TO A BLACK PERSON BE INCARCERATED EIGHT TIMES. THE RATE OF A WHITE PERSON OR A BLACK MAN BEING CONVICTED OF A FELONY. OF BEING 42% MORE LIKELY BE SENTENCED TO PRISON THAN A LIGHT NEGATIVE DONNIE THAT'S THEIR SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE STANDING BY. RIGHT NOW THAT'S THE STATUS QUO AND THAT'S WHAT THEY OPPOSED TO LAST YEAR THE LAST YEAR THEY POSE THEY SAID WE ALREADY HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. WELL CLEARLY THEY'RE NOT WORKING AND SO I JUST ASK THAT WE CAN EXTEND THIS- I TO ALL THAT HAVE BEEN IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. SOME OF OUR CAN INDICATED THAT WE HAVE HAD SOME POP HONEST AS TO HOW WE ACTUALLY CAN CAN HAVE THESE CASES HEARD IN A WAY THAT'S ORDERLY THAT MAKES SENSE- AND- THE- THE FACT THAT- WE'RE EVEN HERE IS A TESTAMENT TO THIS LEGISLATURE SUPPORTING. THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT LAST YEAR I'M GRATEFUL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING THIS AND FOR THE COMMENTS AND- TO THE WITNESSES THEY SHARE THEIR STORIES OVER A HUNDRED ORGAN NEARLY HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS SOME OF THEIR SUPPORT. AND THANK YOU THE EIGHTY TWO FIFTY SIX SPONSORS AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE ALL BIGGEST OF YOU IN RIGHTS. HAVE A KILL POLICY PERMANENT PRISONERS CALIFORNIANS UNITED FOR RESPONSIBLE JEKYLL THIS FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS. INITIATE JUSTICE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS CALIFORNIA NEXT GEN AND SILICON VALLEY DE BUG WITH THAT MR CHAREST UP YESTERDAY I BOTH. ON AB TWO FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU AND I TO COME INTO. ONE OF. LAST YEAR A CALLBACK FOR- OF I'M I WAS THAT CAN HELP UP EVERYTHING ON SIDE. AND I'VE BEEN FULL DISCLOSURE. AND BASICALLY BECAUSE OUR SURE IF. MISTER KALRA COULD BE TO FOR. DID YOU SHOULD. WASN'T REALLY HELPFUL IN SAYING THAT THEY WOULD. THEY WOULD ACTUALLY WORK WITH THE JUDGES. AND THE- PJ'S AND- AND CHIEF JUSTICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IT WAS A REAL CONCERN OF MINE WHICH I EXPRESS. TO MISTER KALRA. AND WE DIDN'T HEAR TO BUILT ON THE SIDE. TO HIS CREDIT HE KEPT WORKING AND WORKING IT IN. THE WATER AT. TO WHERE- I SAID LOOK IF YOU IF WHAT WE COMMONLY CALL OVER HERE THE JAILBREAK IT. ALLOWED HIM TO TRY TO TAKE IT ONTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SENATE SIDE SINCE THEN BECAUSE IT WASN'T THEY DIDN'T GIVE THROUGH SINCE THEN HE'S PUT IN A LOT OF WORK. HE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK TALKING TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHICH MAKES IT NOT ONLY A BETTER BILL BUT- MOST IMPORTANT- IT GIVES ME- SOME CONFIDENCE THAT SOME KIND OF IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WILL COME OUT OF THIS. AND AS FAR AS FUNDING- WE WERE LUCKY RIGHT NOW WILL FLUSH. AND SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MONIES TOWARD THIS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. AND THE REASON WHY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY THIS IS A GOOD REASON- RACIAL INJUSTICE AFRICAN AMERICANS. BUDGET IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT BILLS FOR D. ACE. THERE'S A I JUST SAW A RETIRED. ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER- CALLED AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. KID THE N. WORD. NOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT ALL THREE HUNDRED CASES THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN. AND THEY MAY ALL BE OVERTURNED BECAUSE OF THIS I THINK EVERY D. A. N. CALIFORNIA IF NOT THE COUNTRY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE KNOWN. IF THIS INDIVIDUAL HAD MADE RACIST COMMENTS- IF YOU LOK AT OJ MARC. BERMAN I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD PUT HIM ON THE STAND IF THEY KNEW. HE HAD MADE SOME RACIAL SLURS AND WAS RECORDED SO. I THINK FOR THE D. A.'S. AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THEIR CASES STICK. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BUILT FOR THEM TO. NOT JUST FOR- AFTER AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE TREATED UNJUSTLY THIS WILL HELP MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF THEIR CASES BE OVERTURNED AND HOW MUCH HOW MUCH TIME AND RESOURCES WOULD IT IS GOING TO TAKE FOR THEM TO DEFEND IT AGAIN. IT IN COURT AS THESE PRISONERS COME OUT. AND START TO BOB GOOD APPELLATE COURT ANYWAY. THE WHAT I JUST SAID THIS ONE OFFICER. POSSIBLY THREE HUNDRED CASES SO IT IS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST ON BOTH THE DA SITE AND FROM A JUST SOCIETY AND- IT IS DONE. I REQUEST FOR THE PAST FOUR NINE VOTE I DON'T BELIEVE IT YOU MIGHT THINK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS WE WERE JUST. OF WHICH DRIVING THROUGH. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY TWO FIFTY SIX AT THE BILL'S IMPROPERLY MOVED AND SECONDED BY SOME MEMBER KALRA THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER GENSER IRAQI LACKEY NO BARRICADE CAN STARKEY HAD AYE CORK.

SO ALL RIGHTS ARE DOING NOW AB EIGHTEEN RIGHT. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU ALL FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS PARTICULAR BILL- IT WOULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO FACILITATE THE TESTING OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EVIDENCE KITS. COLLECTED PRIOR TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. THIS ITEM SHOULD LOOK A LITTLE FAMILIAR TO MOST OF YOU. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY ONE. THE VEHICLE- FOR THIS GOAL LAST YEAR WAS TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY ONE AND A PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REBUILDING TWENTY TWENTY THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST THIRTEEN THOUSAND. NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE UNTESTED RAPE KITS IN THE POSSESSION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIME LABORATORIES THIS NUMBER. IS COMPRISED OF HORRIFIC STORIES FROM EACH OF OUR DISTRICTS. DNA EVIDENCE COULD BE PIVOTAL WHEN THE ASSAILANT IS UNKNOWN TO THE VICTIM. FURTHER CAN CONSOLIDATE CRIMES AND CATCH REPEAT OFFENDERS. I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY AT THIS POINT I DO HAVE NAY NESTLE ARNOLD BEST WOMAN THE PRESIDENT CRIME VICTIMS UNITED. I THINK HOPEFULLY ON THE LINE. I'M STILL HERE. ALL RIGHT YOU MAY BEGIN. FIVE MINUTES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN HONORABLE GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN ARAMBULA MEMBERS CRIME VICTIMS UNITED IS EXTREMELY- PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR HIS DILIGENT AND ASSISTING VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THANK JUSTICE- SEXUAL. STATISTICALLY AN MAY KNOWS PUBLIC THE UNDER CRIME THERE IS. HE'S BRAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COME FORWARD- TO NOT ONLY REPORTER CRIMES TO TRY TO HAVE THEM PROSECUTED IT IS A GREAT SERVICE TO HAVE THEIR CASES SHELVES FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD- IT'S REALLY TRULY RE VICTIMIZING THESE BRAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING FORWARD. TO TALK ABOUT INTERMENT- VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF JOB THAT NIGHT- ALTHOUGH SB EIGHT THIRTEEN AND S. B. TWENTY TWO PROVIDED SOME FORTIFIED AVENUES FOR VICTIMS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TESTING RAPE KITS THE ONES THAT ARE PRIOR TO TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE STILL SITTING ON A SHELF APPROXIMATELY OVER. THINK THAT JACK NUMBER THIRTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE KIDS- THAT THIRTEEN THOUSAND VICTIMS THAT ARE OUT THERE SEEKING JUSTICE BUT ALSO WHAT I THINK IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING IS HAVE THESE CORRECTED BEFORE THE. DNA IS- NO LONGER DO DEAL TO TEST IT IS QUITE. AS WE ALL NOTED BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDER A CRIME. IT IS ALSO A CRIME AND THAT IS A REPEAT OFFENDERS AND PACKED AVERAGE RATE THIS THANKS NINE TIMES BEFORE EVER EVEN BEING CAUGHT ARCHITECT INCOMING FOR. SO IT'S TWO FOLD AFFECTED BY NOT HAVING- SEATS GET. KIDS TOUGHEST THAT IS THE VICTIMS ARE IN A WAITING PATTERN AND TRYING TO SEEK JUSTICE AND BEING RE VICTIMIZED BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME WHAT I WOULD BELIEVE THE WORST OFFENDERS OUT UP ON OUR STREETS. GENERALLY THESE PEOPLE PREY ON THE MOST VULNERABLE WHETHER THEIR CHILDREN OR WOMEN OR MEN THEY TEND TO BE THE MORE VULNERABLE VICTIM POPULATION AND THEY'RE OUT THERE STILLPREYING ON BECAUSE THEY HAVE ON LARGELY UNDETECTED. THEREFORE I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE AND ASKED THAT THIS- COMMITTEE DO AN AYE VOTE SO THAT WE CAN BRING NOT ONLY JUSTICE TO VICTIMS BUT THAT WE CAN ALSO. TAKE FROM- EXTREMELY VIOLENT PERPETRATORS OFFERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES. ARE ANY WOULD HERE IN THE- AND WITNESSES. OUR INDIVIDUAL CONFERENCE ROOM AT&amp;T DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES THAT ARE ON THE LINE ON THE PHONE. WE DO HAVE FROM LINE A ONE OR THREE. PLEASE GO AHEAD.

LARRY MORSE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER MOORE. AND LINE NUMBER. ONE NINETY SEVEN. REBECA GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THEN ONCE AGAIN IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT IT IS ONE AND THEN ZERO AND WE HAVE ONE NUMBER ONE FORTY SEVEN. THIS CHAIRMAN I NUMBER ONE FORTY DOLLARS. VERY A LARGE CHUNK THE THANK YOU.

RIGHT SURE WHAT THE RESEARCHERS LOCATION IN SANTA ANA POLICE OFFICERS PROFICIENT YEAH ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. IS THAT IT AT&amp;T. FOR SUPPORT THAT IS THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER AND SUPPORT ON THE IN THE QUEUE. OKAY I BELIEVE WE HAVE MARGO GEORGE C. PDA. ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION. YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- I'M MARCO GEORGIAN I'M HERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION I AM A RETIRED ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER AFTER THIRTY PLUS YEARS OF BEING A PUBLIC DEFENDER WE ARE OPPOSED TO EIGHTY EIGHTEEN BECAUSE THAT MICROMANAGES THE LIMITED RESOURCES OF. CHANCE TO THE DETRIMENT OF CURRENT PROSECUTIONS AND AN AFFRONT INDIVIDUALS. AWAITING TRIAL AND THOSE WHO WOULD BE EXONERATED ONCE THE DNA AND THEIR CASE IS OUR COMPLETE. THIS BILL REQUIRES SAID OLD SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS TO BE ANALYZED IN THE DNA TESTED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S NECESSARY TO PROSECUTE THE CASE. THE DEFENDANT HAS ALREADY PLED GUILTY. OR ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE SO THAT THE DNA CAN BE ADDED INTO A STATE AND NATIONAL DATABASE. LAB TESTING IS NOT AN UNLIMITED RESOURCE JUST LIKE DOCTORS AND NURSES IN THE HOSPITAL WITH THEIR ONLY SO MANY BANDS PROSECUTORS AND CRIME LABS NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRY IT TRIAGE THEIR WORK AND BE NIMBLE TO RESPOND TO CURRENT CRISES. THE LIMITED. RESOURCE IS A CRIME LABS ARE NOT HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS. LAST YEAR TRYING TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON THE INNOCENT- INDIVIDUALS I TALKED ABOUT A FORMER CLIENT TONY WHO WAS CHARGED WITH AN ARMED ROBBERY AT A CONVENIENCE STORE. BUT IMAGINE THAT IT'S YOUR INNOCENT FAMILY MEMBER THE STORE VIDEO DEPICTED THE ROBBER WHO LOOKS LIKE YOUR FAMILY MEMBER DROPPING ITS BASEBALL CAP AS HE FLED THE STORE. YOUR BROTHER SAID THAT HE DIDN'T DO THE ROBBERY. SO YOU DEMANDED THAT THE DEFENSE ASKED THE PROSECUTION TO TEST THE CAP FOR DNA. THE CRIME LAB WAS SO BACKED UP WITH THE DNA REQUESTS THAT IT TOOK MONTHS FINALLY YOUR BROTHER WAS EXONERATED AFTER SPENDING EIGHT MONTHS IN JAIL FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT. THAT TIME IN JAIL HAD COST THE LOFT IS JOHN AND HIS APARTMENT. ALL THE DNA TESTING HAS GOTTEN FASTER AND COSTS LESS NOW IT STILL REQUIRES EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT AND TRAINED CRIMINALIST. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON A. B. EIGHTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU HI THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE AUDIENCE. ANY WITNESSES ON VIDEO CONFERENCING AND OUR GREAT AT T. R. W. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE. IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN IF. ZERO AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY QUEUING UP MISTER SHARE. OKAY THANK YOU. BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER K. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I AM RATHER SPEECHLESS BUT I WILL TRY THAT SO I KNOW HAVING SAT ON THE COMMITTEE WITH THE AUTHOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW THAT HE AND I SHARE THE GOAL OF HAVING ALL CRIMES- SOLVED AND THAT EVERYBODY IN A SHOULD BE TESTED BUT THE FACTS THAT. PEOPLE WHO ARE VIOLATED IN THIS WAY THAT THEN GO THROUGH THE HIM YOU HUMILIATION. AND DISCOMFORT AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WORDS TO USE TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN SOMEONE GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS OF HAVING A RAPE KIT COLLECTED OFF OF HIS OR HER BODY. TO THEN SAY THAT THOSE TESTS SHOULD NOT BE TESTED. BECAUSE WELL THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT SHOULD BE TESTED IS. SHOCKING TO ME IT SHOULD ALL BE TESTED AND I AM I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IS PRIORITIZING A BILL BEING CARRIED BY MISS DOLLY WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT WE FULLY FUNDS. THE RAPE TEST PROCESS SO THAT THERE ARE DOCTORS AVAILABLE TO DO THIS FOR WOMEN THAT NEED IT BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY AREAS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE YOU CAN'T GET THIS DONE IN A QUICK FASHION WOMEN SIT IN THEIR CLOTHING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RAPED IN FOR DAYS. BEFORE THEY GET THIS. PROCESS DONE AND SO IT IS INCUMBENT UPON EACH AND EVERYONE OF US TO ENSURE THAT THOSE VICTIMS ARE SUPPORTED. THAT THEIR TESTS ARE RUN AND THAT THEY GET THE JUSTICE THEY DESERVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CLARK. YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE A D. A. DECIDED THAT. THERE WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE THEY DIDN'T NEED TO PASS THAT TO LOOK AT THE DNA IS NOT A GOOD REASON FOR ME EVEN IF PRISON PERSON PLEADS GUILTY. SOME PEOPLE FEEL ALL THE EVIDENCE IS SO MUCH AGAINST ME I'LL JUST BE GUILTY BECAUSE BOB. I MEAN THAT HAPPENS AND SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE TEST EVERY SINGLE. ONE AND I THINK I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE AGAINST IT. NOW THEY DO HAVE A CONCERN. I FRANKLY CAN'T. LOOK LOCAL AGENCIES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SET THEIR OWN PRIORITIES AND I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WILL NEGLECT THE CURRENT CASE BECAUSE OF THE S. AND FRANKLY THEY NEGLECTED THE OTHER LOVE WHERE WE TELL THEM THEY HAD TO REPORT ON ALL THE CASES THAT THEY HAVE AT ALL OF THE KIDS THAT THEY HADN'T DONE THEY'LL DO THEIR OWN THING THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT SAYS THEY HAVE TO GO TO JAIL THE SOMETHING WASN'T TESTED BY THE DEADLINE IN THE BILL. SO I THINK IT IS DISINGENUOUS TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT AND I HOPE THE- THE- PUBLIC DEFENDERS WILL REVERSE YOUR POSITION ON THIS SCALE I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE MONEY TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES SO THEY CAN DO THIS THIS IS A YEAR COULD ALLOCATE WHATEVER MILLIONS. OF DOLLARS IT TAKES TO DO IT. AND YOU'VE ALREADY DONE TWO MILLION TWO MILLION TIMES ON THE HEAD. THAT'S WHAT'S KNOWN IN THIS STATE AS A BUDGET DOES- IS IT GOING TO BE GET. MISTER CHAIR WOULD LIKELY TO GET THAT MONEY IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. I HEAR IT ON BUDGET SO FIVE OKAY SO THIS MR LACKEY. PERFECT WELL WE'LL MAKE SURE IT GETS IN THERE AND IT'S NOT THAT MUCH MONEY SO AGAIN PUBLIC DEFENDER WILL PLEASE REVERSE YOUR POSITION. THANK YOU THE NEW YORK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE MISLED. THE WITNESSES MUTUM CELLS BECAUSE WE GET A LOT OF FEEDBACK. THIS BILL. IS THAT. WHEN I CAN'T RELATE- AND I HEARD OF WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S. WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT INNOCENCE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FOURTEEN THOUSAND. INNOCENT PEOPLE. THE RUN THROUGH. TORTURE AN EXPERIENCE THAT'S ON DESCRIBABLE. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU MR LACKEY IN NOT THAT I THINK YOU'VE ALL SAID ENOUGH THEM NOT ONLY WILL I SUPPORT BILL YOU AND I NEED GOT SOME WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE GET THAT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO GET OUT.

THE STATE TO FORCIBLY ENTERING A VEHICLE WITH THE INTENT TO COMMIT THEFT OR ANY OTHER FELONY IS GUILTY OF AN UNLAWFUL ENTRY OF A VEHICLE THIS LANGUAGE. WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE PENAL CODE SECTION FOUR FIVE NINE WHICH OUTLINES CALIFORNIA BURGLARY STATUTE. EVEN THOUGH WE JUST GOT THIS LETTER LIKE A WEEK AGO. SO WE ACCEPT THAT THAT AMENDMENT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE. ANYBODY ELSE- LIEUTENANT BRANDON YEP LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. YEAH MEMBERS HEARING THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECOND I'LL KEEP THAT EVEN SHORTER- THE L. A. COUNTY FAIR BILL AND WE ASK FOR YOUR I.

WE HAVE LINE NUMBER TWO FIFTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LARRY MORSE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE IN Q. FOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I HAVE- MARGO GEORGE AND C. P. B. A. N. KATHY BRADY IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER. FIVE MINUTES LATER YES. WELL I'M NOT SURE IF- KATHY IS GOING TO WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION THAT- THIS IS MARGO GEORGE AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AGAIN- THE AMENDMENT WILL NOT SATISFY OUR CONCERNS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE AB THREE NINETY FIVE- CREATES A NEW CRIME WHICH IT TURNS BASICALLY AIN'T MALICIOUS MISCHIEF FOR VANDALISM- BY ONE OF THOUSANDS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SHELTER IN OUR URBAN AREAS INTO A FELONY.AB THREE NINETY FIVE IS DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING LAW AUTO BURGLARY BURGLARY IS ALREADY A LAW CLERK WITH THE EXACT SAME PENALTIES. COURTS HAVE ACCEPTED BROKEN WINDOWS IS EVIDENCE OF FORCIBLE ENTRY AND THAT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE B. ICAL LET'S LOCKED FOR DECADES- PROPHETICALLY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. AND PEOPLE BEING MALCOLM THE COURT FOUND THAT A LOT CAR WITH AN UNLOCKED FRONT WING WINDOW. SATISFIED THE STATUTE WHERE THERE WERE SIGNS OF FORCED ENTRY AND THEN AGAIN THE SOME THIRTY YEARS LATER AND PEOPLE BE. RIVIERA THE COURT FOUND THAT THERE WAS JUST CANCEL CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE CAR'S DOORS WERE LOCKED SOLELY BASED ON THE CAR. WINDOWS BEING BROKEN. SO I KNOW ON THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY NOT MENTION THIS THIS YEAR AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS ONE OF HIS CONCERNS. IN THE PAST THE AUTHOR HAD SAID THAT THIS WAS- AN ISSUE. BECAUSEIN URBAN AREAS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES TOURISTS AND RESIDENTS. I HAD TO SHOW UP IN COURT TO TESTIFY- IF THE CASE WE'RE GOING TO TRIAL BUT EVEN IF YOU AMEND IT TO MAKE A NEW- ON A NEW FOR. LOBULAR DESCRIPTIVE THEY WILL STILL HAVE TO RETURN TO TESTIFY- CRIMINAL SOLUTIONS ARE PENALTIES NOT THE SOLUTION TO EVERY PROBLEM NOT EVERY INCIDENT OF IMPROPER BEHAVIOR NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY A NEW LEGAL PROHIBITION AND INCREASED PUNISHMENT. ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM OF INCREASE VEHICLE THEFT IN OUR URBAN AREAS IT IS NOT A PROBLEM NEEDED TO BE SOLVED BY STATE LAW WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON AB THREE NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS YOURS AND KATHY BRADY. AVAILABLE HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES CAN YOU HEAR ME WELL YES- I'M CATHY BRADY. I'M CAPPY BRADY AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER AND I'VE WORKED FOR THIRTY YEARS SWELLED DOC DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND JUDGES TO TRY TO WORK OUT- THE SPECIAL PENALTIES THAT COME DOWN ON IMMIGRANTS FROM EVEN MINOR CALIFORNIA CONVICTIONS. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TO THIS LAW THAT WILL- CHECK SOME OF OUR MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRANTS. WE STILL WOULD OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE ALREADY SIXTEEN TO THREE FELONIES AND WILDFLOWERS SUCH AS VANDALISM AND THEFT. THAT COVER THIS PARTICULAR OFFENSE. AND AT THIS MOMENT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A GOOD TIME TO BE CREATING MORE CRIMES AS WE TRY TO DECRIMINALIZE BUT I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE IMMIGRATION AMENDMENT.

THANK YOU AND ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR QUIRK- TO THE PROSECUTOR INTO THE CHIEF PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ARM I HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED MAKING OUR SYSTEM- MORE- PUNISH PEOPLE MORE I DON'T THINK THAT HELPS BUT IN THIS CASE WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING. IS TRYING TO CALL CRIME A CRIME AND MAKE SURE IT'S PROSECUTED THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS FRANKLY- I'M UPSET WE'VE TRIED TO PASS THIS BEFORE I'M UPSET IT HAS BEEN FOUGHT IN APPROPRIATIONS IT CETERA. THIS IS THIS IS PROSECUTING THE CRIME THAT'S ALREADY A CRIME IT IS VERY EASY TO GET INTO A CAR WITHOUT BREAKING A WINDOW I AM SURE THE AUTHOR. WILL CAN GIVE US- MANY MANY STORIES- OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO THIS WHO DON'T BREAK WINDOWS AND GET INTO CARS- IT FURTHER AS I READ THIS. I HAVE A PERSON WE'RE TRULY COLD AND HUNGRY AND JUST SAT AND SOMEBODY'S CAR. IT SAYS WITH INTENT TO COMMIT A CRIME THERE'S NO CRIME HERE SO AGAIN.

I RELATE TO OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND GIVING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE- ROLE TO INVESTIGATE- INCIDENTS WITH AN UNARMED CIVILIAN THIS WILL THIS ELEMENT WAS IN LAST YEAR'S BILL IT WAS A BIT COMPLICATED SO SOME OF THE PARTY SAID ONCE YOU COME BACK NEXT YEAR WITH A FRESH BILL. ESSENTIALLY THIS CLIP THIS CHANGES THE LOOP AS FAR AS THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS WHEN THERE IS LET ME GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES RIGHT HERE IN WEST SACRAMENTO ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO THERE'S A TRAGIC SHOOTING. AT THAT SENIOR CITIZEN YOU KNOW LOST IT LAST NIGHT BROUGHT OUT A GUN WAS POINTING AT PEOPLE THE WEST SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT DEFENDED THEMSELVES AND SHOT AND KILLED THE SUSPECT. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE SECOND FROM THE WEST SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT THEY HAVE A PROCESS ALREADY- ON THE RULES WHERE THE ADJACENT DEPARTMENT COMES AND BECOMES THE THAT THE LEAKS OF THE CITY WEST SACRAMENTO'S PARLAY INVESTIGATION BUT THE DEAD JASON CITY IS PART AT LEAST BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS DISTRUST AS FAR AS POLICE POLICING THEMSELVES. THIS PRACTICE IS IN- MOST OF OUR JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT PARTS OF OUR LARGER JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE STEPPING UP BEING AND DOING THIS THIS WOULD JUST MAKE IT A LOT OF LAND IN CALIFORNIA THAT CITIES HAVE TO HAVE- IN ADJACENT LAW ENFORCEMENT JURISDICTIONS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION- THEY WOULD NO LONGER BE THE LEAD- WE HAVE- OUR LOCAL- DA HERE. IN IN BACK OF ILL WILL DROP A POINT LAST YEAR THE SHOOTING WITH THE MONTERO SENT A FAMILY MEMBER HERE FROM A LITTLE BIT AFTER THE SHOOTING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT- OF- OF- BACK AVAIL- THE SENSUALLY DESTROYED EVIDENCE AND SELL THE DA SAID IN THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HAVING THAT GAINED THE POLICE POLICE.

TO INVEST- AGAIN WE ARE WORKING WITH- LAW ENFORCEMENT THE- POLICE CHIEFS IN THE DA'S ASSOCIATIONS ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH US THEY'RE NOT LISTED AT SUPPORT JUST YET. BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM AND WE ARE WORKING IN LISTENING TO OPPOSITION AND THINK THAT THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND WE CAN COME TO YOU. AS THE BILL- PROGRESSES THROUGH THE PROCESS UP WITH THAT NO IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY I WOULD ASK MY WITNESSES TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND TESTIFY. AND PROCEED WITH THE HEARING THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN YOU WITNESSES MAY BE AGAIN YOU HAVE A- ROBERT STRAIN CHIEF OF POLICE WEST SACRAMENTO. AND ASHLEY MONTEREY ROSA. SAYS SISTER. EVENING GO AHEAD MOST VULNERABLE. HI EVERYONE I'M HONORED TO HAVE BEEN AFTER MY TESTIMONY FOR EIGHTY FIVE NINE FOUR FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW I'M ACTUALLY BONTA WROTE THAT THE SURVIVING SISTER OF MY BROTHER SEAN MONTERROSA ON JUNE SECOND OF TWENTY TWENTY MY BROTHER SEAN WAS KNEELING WITH HIS HANDS UP WHEN OFFICER GERAKAN OF THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF AN UNMARKED PICKUP TRUCK WITH AN A. R. FIFTEEN. SEAN WAS BASICALLY KILLED IN A DRIVE BY A MONTH AFTER MY BROTHER'S MURDER THE PRESIDENT OF THE POLICE UNION MICHAEL NICOLINI OF LALE ORDERED THE DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE THE WINDSHIELD WAS DESTROYED AND THE UNMARKED PICKUPTRUCK WAS PUT PUT BACK INTO SERVICE AS NOTHING HAD EVER OCCURRED SINCE JUNE SECOND INFORMATION OF WHAT'S BEEN CALLED QUOTE UNQUOTE BAD SPENDING A RITUAL OF THE BOND VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LEAKED TO THE PUBLIC AND SPARKED NATIONAL OUTRAGE IN THESE BAD BENDING RITUALS. METAL DOOR THE OFFICER INVENTOR THING IF I HAVE ANYBODY THAT KILLED CELEBRATED BY A BARBECUE AS AN INITIATION PARTY I SAY ALL THIS TO SAY OFFICER THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS LIKE WILL DOUBLE LAYER POLICE DEPARTMENT CANNOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES INVESTIGATE THEMSELVES AND MY BROTHER'S CASE IT'S BECOME A POLITICAL GAME OF HOT POTATO D. A. CHRISTIAN ABRAMS OF SOLANO COUNTY HAS ACCUSED YOURSELF SHORTLY AFTER THE FOOTAGE WAS RELEASED. FURTHERMORE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YET BUT DATA SAID HE WOULD REVIEW THE ENTIRE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT INCLUDING MY BROTHER'S MURDER ONLY FOR HIM TO REJECT WHAT HE SAID AND ONLY INVESTIGATE THE DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE ON THE FOUR MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF MY BROTHER'S DEATH MY SISTER AND I ALONGSIDE FIFTEEN OTHER NONVIOLENT PROTESTERS ARRIVE TO GOVERNOR GOVERNOR ANY SOME SONG AND DEMANDED THAT HE APPOINTED SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND INVESTIGATE JOHN CASE AND THE CORRUPT.

MY HOPE. IS AB FIVE NINE FOUR IS THAT K. AS YOU LIKE BROTHERS DON'T GET SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. THEY MUST BEEN IN. AND NON BY GROUP INVESTIGATING OFFICER ABOUT SHOOTINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD EVENING MISTER TO MA'AM THANKS FOR THE UP TO BUY TODAY A FIVE FOUR MY NAME IS ROB AND PLACE YOU THEM FOR THE BUCK WHAT. WHAT GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RISK. THE MODERN POLICE LEADER KNOWS THE ADDRESS THE AMOUNT OF THE DOOR PLEASE I FOR. ENGAGES APPROACH AND PROFESSIONAL SCRUTINY OF POLICE ACTION INVOLVED THE USE OF FORCE. THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE- OF THE SKIRT PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT ONE OF POLICING COUNTER RESULT IN THE DEATH OF A COMMUNITY MEMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS. AB FIVE NINETY FOUR CREATE CLEARLY DEFINED ROLES FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF OFFICER INVOLVED FATAL INCIDENT SO THAT THE PEOPLE. CAN BE MORE REASONABLY ASSURED THAT THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE INDEPENDENT AND LEGITIMATE. AT THE STATE MANDATE PATHWAY FOR COST RECOVERY FOR INVESTIGATORS BUT EXPENSIVE IS NOTABLE AND IMPORTANT. WHAT TECHNOPOLIS BERMAN MIKE ALL YOUR WOOD COUNTY AGENCIES EMPLOYED THAN ONE HUNDRED COMMUNITY POLICE OFFICERS. SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT BODY HAS USED AB NINE FIVE NINETY FOUR ALIGNED APPROACHES TO INVESTIGATING FATAL POLICE ENCOUNTERS. WITH APPROACH WAS CONCEIVED AFTER RESEARCHING SIMILAR METHODOLOGIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN MY PRIOR ROLE AS THE CHIEF INVESTIGATOR FOR THE OLD COUNTY DA'S OFFICE. NEIL COUNTY OFFICER CRITICAL INCIDENT PROTOCOL UTILIZES AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY COUPLED WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY PROVIDING OVERSIGHT TO CONDUCT A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION A BOXER ACTION IN FAILING TO. WHAT THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE FULLER REVIEW THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ISSUED A SUMMARY TRIBUNE FINAL AND MAKE THIS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. THIS PROTOCOL BEEN UTILIZED OVER TEN TIMES THE BOOK FATAL AND NON FATAL ACCIDENTS SINCE IMPLEMENTATION. HAS WORKED WELL REAL COUNT. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO THAT INCREASING OUR PROFESSION'S CREDIBILITY PERCEPTION OF LEGITIMACY AND OVERALL COMMUNITY CONFIDENCE IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. THIS IS THERE WAS BROAD SUPPORT FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TAKE ON THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOLE IN THE EARLY ITERATIONS OF AB FIFTEEN OF SIX. MANDATE CONTAINED IN THIS BILL REFLECT A PRAGMATIC CORRECTIVE STEP ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER AND EVEN SOME MEDIUM SIZE ABLE TO CROSS THE STATE. I DO BELIEVE THERE WILL NEED TO BE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FIT AND IMPLICATIONS OF THIS APPROACH WITH LARGE AGENCIES. OFTEN LARDED WITH THE EXPERTS WITH VASTLY MORE EXPERIENCED IN THE SPACE- TRANSPONDER KEY STEP IN CONTEMPORARY BEST PRACTICES. LIKELY VALIDATING THEIR INVESTIGATIVE CAPACITY IN PROFESSIONAL. I COULD ALSO SEE THAT A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD ON SMALLER NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS COULD BE SO TACTIC BUT AT THE MEASURE DIMINISHES THAT SMALLER AGENCIES CAPACITY TO SERVE THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. THIS ASIDE I BELIEVE AB FIVE NINETY FOUR WOULD BE A GOOD STANDARDIZED APPROACH FOR SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED AGENCIES THAT SUPPORT THIS APPROACH TO ACHIEVING INDEPENDENT DESTINATIONS ON OFFER INVOLVED FATAL INCIDENT ALL THREE LAUNCH FORTUNATE DIDN'T INCOMPETENCE. AND HAVE SEEN IT SUCCESSFULLY. AND UTILIZED. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING INPUT ON BILL. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN AN COMMITTEE. THAT WOULD SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

IS IT NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WE ARE IN BETWEEN- WE DO SUPPORT THE PRINCIPLE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT THAT. THAT THAT THERE SHOULD BE LONG PORTION NOT INVESTIGATE THEMSELVES HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES NOT ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY TO INVESTIGATE IT SHIFTED INTO A DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE SO WE'RE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU. WE HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT IN QUEUE LINE NUMBER SIXTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. CANACCORD ON ON BEHALF OF THE CANTICLE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY QUEUING UP MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CORY'S ALLSTATE ZILLOW- COUNTY STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION ON THE PHONE. PRETTY OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CORY CELLS L. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE NINETY FOUR AS NOTED THE BILL WOULD PRECLUDE AN EMPLOYING AGENCY FROM HAVING PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IN CONDUCTING A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION- BUT WOULD NOT APPLY TO OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF UNARMED CIVILIANS THAT IS ALREADY COVERED. BY LAST YEAR'S AB FIFTEEN OH SIX- WELL SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE POLICIES AND PRACTICES SIMILAR TO WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE BILL AS YOU RECENTLY HEARD OTHER AGENCIES FOR VARIOUS REASONS HAVE FOUND IT MORE APPROPRIATE AND OR FEASIBLE TO UNDERTAKE THESE INVESTIGATIONS THEMSELVES SOME LARGER AGENCIES MAY BE BEST EQUIPPED TO TAKE ON THE DIFFICULT INVESTIGATION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL. ARTICULATELY AS IT RELATES TO SHERIFF'S OFFICES THERE MAY BE NO CITY POLICE AGENCY FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. EITHER IN THE CASE OF A POLICE INITIALLY THERE MAY NOT BE A CITY POLICE AGENCY AT ALL- IN A SMALL COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE- FOR THE POLICE AGENCY OR DIS OFFICE THAT EXISTS MAY NOT BE CAPABLE OF HANDLING THIS TYPE OF INVESTIGATION GIVEN THE SIZE AND- EXPERTISE OF THEIR STAFF. WITHOUT OFFENSE TO THEM JUST THE WAY THAT I CAN BE SOMETIMES- RELATEDLY WHEN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE MAY BE THE ONLY AGENCY AND I COUNTY A QUICK TO INVESTIGATE SUCH CASES. THIS BILL WOULD EFFECTIVELY PUT ALL THE BURDEN ON THAT SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO COMPLY WITH THE BILL WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF RESOURCES AND COSTS- AGAIN LAST YEAR'S AB FIFTEEN OH SIX HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET. BUT AB FIVE NINETY FOUR WOULD FURTHER COMPLICATE MATTERS RELATED TO INVESTIGATING IMPORTANT CASES FOR THIS REASON THAN THOSE STATED ABOVE CSSA UNFORTUNATELY MUST OPPOSE AB FIVE NINETY FOUR. HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR- BUT IN THE CURRENT FORM. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THEY YOU. ARE THERE ANY. ANYONE INSIDE THE CHAMBER THAT. SEEING NONE THERE IN OPPOSITION ANYONE ON THE TELECONFERENCE IN OPPOSITION. AND NOW AT&amp;T TO THE FRONT OR ANY PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION. OF A. B. BIARLAH MORE. THE PROJECT AND IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION IT IS. ONE ZERO. WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY QUEUING UP. OKAY BRING IT TO THE BODY IT TO THE- LIST MR LACKEY HAS A QUESTION. OR COMMENT FOR. LITTLE BIT OF BOTH I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST OF ALL- ASK YOU A VERY DIRECT QUESTION HOW WOULD AGENCIES- GET FINANCIALLY REIMBURSED. IT WOULD BE A REQUIREMENT LIKE WE SEE WITH SO MANY AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA DOING THIS NEARLY. YEAH I AGREE I AGREE HERE YEAH. LIKE WE SEE AGENCIES DOING THIS TODAY I MEAN. WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER OF OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS GO DOWN HOPEFULLY THEY'LL CONTINUE TO GO DOWN WITH. A GOOD HANDS TRAINING- WITH AB THREE NINETY TWO AND TWO THIRTY THE RESOURCES FROM THE BUDGET A FEW YEARS AGO. SOME OF THESE OF COURSE WILL NOW GO TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE JURISDICTIONS THEY HAVE THEY HAVE TEAMS ALREADY DOING INVESTIGATIONS AND SO THE ADJACENT THAT THE TURKS IN THE CASE OF DEPARTMENT WOULD COME OVER AND HELP LIKE SO MANY OF THESE. THESE ARE DOING TODAY WITH THEM TO USE EXISTING POLICY SO IT WOULD BE FINDING OUT OF THESE FUNDED OUT OF EXISTING- LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCES. OKAY SECONDLY. ON THESE VERY RURAL. PORTIONS OF THE STATE AND WE HAVE MANY OF THEM. YEAH WHERE- THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF MILES. IF NOT THOUSANDS. OF MILES TO- TO PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES FOR AND SO THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE. AGENCIES THAT ARE RIGHT NEXT TO THEM THE BUT UP NEXT TO A MISSILE THAT PUTS HIM AT A VERY EXTREME A DISADVANTAGE IN FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE FUNDING. IS ALSO NOT THAT STRONG AND I JUST I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. BILL BECAUSE IT ALSO PRESUPPOSES MISTRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT. HAVING DONE THESE KIND OF INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN MY OWN AGENCY. FOR A LONG TIME I COULD TELL YOU THAT- THIRD THERE'S STRONG INTEREST IN GETTING TO THE TRUTH. INDEPENDENT OF- SAME AGENCY CONNECTION SO I CAN I'M SORRY BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU YOU MAY ANSWER THE QUESTION I WOULD YEAH- SO I THINK THERE ARE TWO POINTS THAT BROUGHT THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION AND BY MY SUPPORTER FRANKLY THAT SHE FROM. WEST SACRAMENTO TALKING ABOUT LARGE URBAN AGENCIES THINK OF L. A. P. D. L. A. COUNTY SHERIFF THEY HAVE EXPERTISE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE RELIC SHERIFF TO BRING IN. CITY OF PALMDALE I'M NOT SURE THEY HAVE A POLICE DEPARTMENT SO. WE'RE WILLING TO THINK ABOUT THAT INTERACTION BUT HAVING ANOTHER POLICE DEPARTMENT PART OF IT I THINK THIS BRINGS ABOUT MORE PUBLIC TRUST THAT THE UMPIRE CALLING BALLS AND STRIKES ISN'T YOU KNOW LEAN ON ONE TEAM- IN THE RURAL AREAS TO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL CERTAINLY LOOK AT THINKING ABOUT. THE DALAI DISTRICT UP THERE AND I'LL TURN US THERE'S NO JURISDICTION AROUND THE ATLANTA PROBABLY ISN'T ALTURAS POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT COUNT IT'S THE STATE'S THE COUNTY SHERIFF. SO I THINK THOSE ARE REASONABLE THINGS BUT I DO KNOW THIS THIS IS THE FUTURE OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THE POLICE CHIEFS ARE SAYING WE WANT TO DO MORE OF THIS. THEY KNOW THAT THERE IS DISTRUST. MAYBE THERE SHOULDN'T BE AS YOU SAY BUT THERE IS COMMITTEE DISTRUST HAVING HAVING MORE INDEPENDENCE IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS BRINGS ABOUT I THINK A BETTER OUTCOME BRINGS ABOUT MORE COMMUNITY- BUYING INTO THE PROCESS AND SO THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS OUR STATE. AND THE MORE JURISDICTIONS THAT DO THIS WHETHER THEY I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE EVERY DEPARTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S WE CAN GET 90% OR BIG VICTORY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. AND TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU MR QUIRK. YEAH MY CONCERN IS THAT I DON'T SEE THIS ENGENDERING ANYMORE TRUST AND HERE'S WHY. THERE ARE ALREADY CONCERNS WHEN THE DA R. INVESTIGATES A POLICE OFFICER THAT HE OR SHE IS- PREJUDICE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POLICE. THERE ARE ALREADY CONCERNS- THAT YOU KNOW OFFICERS IN ONE DEPARTMENT ARE GOING TO BE- HOW CAN THEY SAY DIFFERENTIAL TO AN OFFICER FROM ANOTHER DEPARTMENT. IF YOU WANTED TO SET UP A SEPARATE UNIT MUCH LIKE YOU DID FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHERE I. SUPPORTED THE BALLOT WAS A CO AUTHOR I COULD FEEL SUPPORTIVE BUT I JUST DON'T SEE THIS REALLY ADVANCING THE FOOTBALL SO THAT'S MY CONCERN. THE DO YOU ANSWERING YOUR SERVICE YEAH YEAH- WHAT WHEN I PROPOSED THIS LAST YEAR I TALKED TO A FEW POLICE CHIEFS AND IF YOU D. A.'S AND THEY SAID WHILE NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM THIS WOULD IMPROVE THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRANSFER OF EVIDENCE IS LESS LIKELY TO BE TAMPERED DESTROYED LIKE IT WASN'T DELAY I SIT BACK BILLS VALLEJO. THEY THOUGHT NUMBER ONE THERE'D BE ANOTHER DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE HEY MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T DESTROY THAT WINDSHIELD. READ THE DEPUTY IN THE BACK SHOT THROUGH IS A R. FIFTEEN AND YOU KNOW MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T. DESTROY IT THAT THIS LET'S TAKE A PAUSE ON THAT HAVING ANOTHER SET OF EYES. AND VOICE IN THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT ALSO- YOU KNOW THEY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO WITH WITH THE WITH THE OVERALL COMMUNITY SO- THIS IS ACTUALLY AN IDEA THAT I GOT FROM. LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN WE WERE GOING AND WORKING ON FIFTEEN OH SIX AND GRANTED NOT ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORTS IT. BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA THEY HAVE A ONE OF MY CITIES HERE DOES THIS THE OTHER IS THINKING ABOUT DOING IT. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE MORE CITIES THAT DO THIS SO MAKING INVESTIGATIONS MORE INDEPENDENT AND BRING ABOUT- TRUST AND THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION THE SECOND THANK YOU. READ THE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE. THOUSAND ELIGIBLE. OKAY I'M I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BECAUSE IT IT BEGINS THE PROCESS OF- HAVING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND SCRUTINY IT WELL IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING SO. RESPECTFULLY ASK EVERYONE FOR AN AYE VOTE. I'M AB FIVE NINE FOUR FIVE THE MEMBER MCCARTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQI NOT VOTING LACKEY NOT BODING BARRICADE CAN. BERWICK HE HAD AYE COURT NOT VOTING FOR NOW CORK NOT VOTING SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO I SEE OUR TOWN NO SEE OUR TURN NOW WICKS. WICKS I LI LI I. THE MEASURE. THAT MEASURE PASSES. NUMBER OF. MR PATTERSON YOUR NEXT. ANIMAL WELFARE AB TWO FIVE THREE. WHERE. WE'RE SANITIZING THE AREA RIGHT NOW. AFTER MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU. TWENTY TO PUSH THE BUTTON YOU GET A GOOD YES WE CAN. UP UP WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOTIONS AND- LET ME JUST. BASICALLY PURPOSES- IS REALLY IS A LOT OF RISING. THE MANNER IN WHICH WITH RESPECT TO. COPYRIGHT RESEARCHERS HOW THE NOTIFICATIONS ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED- SO LAW ENFORCEMENT APPEARS AT THE SPIKED IT'S COMMON FOR THE ATTENDEES TO FLEE. THEY LEAVE A LOT OF THE BIRDS BEHIND LAW ENFORCEMENT THEN TAKES POSSESSION- OF THE ANIMALS AND FILES A PETITION WITH THE COURT TO HUMANELY EUTHANIZE. BEFORE DOING SO CURRENT LAW REQUIRES A PUBLIC NOTICE OF DESTRUCTION OF THE ANIMALS TO BE POSTED IN A HARD COPY NEWSPAPER FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS. THE STATUTE THAT DICTATES THE PRACTICE. OF PUBLICIZING THE SEIZURE ND PROPOSED DESTRUCTION OF ROOSTERS USED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED. FOR DECADES AND WAS WRITTEN LONG. SO AB TWO FIFTY THREE SIXTY UPDATE THE PENAL CODE SO THE PUBLIC NOTICES MAY BE PUBLISHED THROUGH ADDITIONAL SOURCES RATHER THAN SOLELY A PRINT NEWSPAPER. AND THE SOURCES INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS AND OR ONLINE PUBLICATIONS THROUGH NEWSPAPER WEBSITES. CURRENTLY- AGENCIES ARE FACED WITH WHAT AMOUNTS TO A- BASICALLY A VERY HIGH COST MONOPOLY. I'VE SEEN- RECEIPTS FROM CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE NEWSPAPERS CHARGE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE JUST FOR THE THREE DAY MINIMUM SO CURRENT LAW IS SETTING UP WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE AN OUTDATED AND EXPENSIVE METHOD. THAT SO THAT THE HARD COPY NEWSPAPERS RECEIVED UP EXCLUSIVITY WHEN IN FACT WE'RE SEEING A DECLINE IN THE CIRCULATION OF THE HARD PRINT NEWSPAPERS WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITIES OF TODAY. BY ALLOWING US TO TAILOR THE MESSAGE TO THE GEOGRAPHY THE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THE LANGUAGE GROUP IT SECTOR. SO BY ALLOWING THOSE THAT WANT TO PUBLISH THAT THE AGENCIES TO PUBLISH THESE NOTICES. ONLINE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PUBLISH THEM MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY MUCH MORE WIDESPREAD AND IN THE MULTIPLE LANGUAGES FURTHER INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS FOR THE PURPOSE- BUT THE NOTIFICATION AB. THIS BILL RECEIVED A UNANIMOUS SUPPORT LAST YEAR I'M HOPING WE CAN. ACHIEVE THAT HERE AGAIN I HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF- CHAU A BUTCHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. SHIP WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER BUSH LOOK. YOU MISTER CHAIR- GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS HE SHAUN MUTCHLER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION WE ARE PLEASED THAT TO SPONSOR ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIFTY THREE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON FOSTERING THIS LEGISLATION AB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD AFFECT THE PUBLICATION NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AT THE SEIZURE AND DESTRUCTION OF LISTER'S. USEFUL COPYWRITING- MANY NEIGHBORING STATES HAVE MAYKOP ACTIVITIES A FELONY AFTER MANY OF THESE OPERATIONS HAVE MOVED TO CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ONLY A MISDEMEANOR MANY OF WHICH ARE HELD IN FRESNO COUNTY. AND WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT THE TIED OF THE CONCERNS OUTLINED IN ANALYSIS REGARDING IMPORTANCE OF USING YOU SPEND FOURTEENTH OFFICIAL NOTICES IN A MANNER THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO EVERYONE. HOWEVER WE AND YOU NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND OUR COMMUNITY THROUGH INCREASINGLY ARE USING DIGITAL MEDIA- WITHOUT AFFECTING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY REQUIRED DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION PROVIDED THEIR STATUTES. WE WOULD LIKE TO SIMPLY UPDATE THE STATUTE SO THAT THE NOTICE TO DESTROY MR HUGHES WILL **** FIGHTING CAN BE PUBLISHED. REGIONALLY- WE- I APPRECIATE IT AGAIN- ASSEMBLY MAR PATTERSON OFFERING IT LEGISLATION AS HE MENTIONED- DISAGREED BILL GET PASSED UNANIMOUSLY LAST HEARING COMMITTEE SO WE HOPE. THAT WE CAN ONCE AGAIN HAVE YOUR SUPPORT AND WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM. ARE ANY WITNESSES THAT ARE IN THE TELECONFERENCE ROOM. EIGHTEEN T. ARE THERE ANY TELEPHONE WITNESSES THEY WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU TWO ONE ZERO THANK YOU UP. IN SUPPORT. AND WE DO HAVE SOMEBODY QUEUING UP IT'LL BE JUST A MOMENT. ONCE AGAIN A ONE MAN ZERO FOR SUPPORT. AND WE HAVE A SUPPORT COMING FROM THE LINE OF TWO SIXTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD EVENING. THURMOND HI JOHN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THIS YEAR YOU CAN REX WHAT THE FCK AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ONCE AGAIN IT IS ONE NINE ZERO FOUR SUPPORT. AND I DO NOT HAVE ANYONE QUEUING UP FOR SUPPORT AS OF NOW. THANK YOU- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I HAVE A- WHITNEY UP POSSIBLY S. C. NPA BY PHONE AND KATHY SURE ACLU. S. AFTERNOON- COUNTY SHERIFF AT THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA- WE RESPECTFULLY NOT DEPOSED EIGHTY TWO FIFTY THREE- EIGHTY TWO FIFTY THREE BUSINESS A REQUIREMENT FOR PUBLICATION OF NOTICE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN ANIMAL FEED IN CONNECTION WITH ANIMAL FIGHTING ARE GOING TO BE DESTROYED. THE APPLICATION IS A SPECIFIC ONE BUT THE PRINCIPLES INVOLVED ABROAD WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TAKES ACTION THAT AFFECT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS IT MUST GIVE NOTICE IN A WAY CALCULATED TO REACH THOSE WHOSE INTERESTS ARE AFFECTED AND SO THAT THE FACT THAT NOTICE HAS BEEN GIVEN HOW CAN BE VERIFIED. THERE ARE WELL OVER A THOUSAND DIFFERENT CODE SECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA LAW THAT PROVIDES FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE NOTICE IN A NEWSPAPER OF GENERAL CIRCULATION OF VARIOUS FACTIONS WITH AFFECT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS INCLUDING EVERYTHING FROM PUTTING THE CONTRACT OUT TO DEAD NOTICES REGARDING PROPOSED LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES. AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT EITHER PROPERTY AND INTENT TO DESTROY IT AWKWARD BUT IT PERMANENTLY IT MUST GIVE NOTICE IN A NEWSPAPER OF GENERAL CIRCULATION NEWSPAPER OF GENERAL CIRCULATION IS DEFINED IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE OBJECT AND SUBJECT TO COURT DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A PUBLICATION. MEETS THOSE CRITERIA. THE STATURE TOUR REQUIRE FROM. OF NOTICE IN THE NEWS. ARE IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE'S MAKING SURE THAT THE PUBLIC GAP INFORMATION ON GOVERNMENT ACTIONS THAT AFFECT THEM. THEY ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT NOTICES PUBLISHED IN AN INDEPENDENT FORUM. THAT CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED THAT THERE IS A RECORD OF THE NOTICE. AND THAT NOTICE IS ACCEPTABLE. AND THAT IT IS GIVEN AWAY TO. MAXIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ALL INTERESTED PARTIES WILL BE ABLE TO SEE A- NEWSPAPER NOTICES MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS TO MEET THEM AND WE WOULD WELCOME A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THOSE WAYS MIGHT BE. BUT ALLOWING NOTICE BE PUBLISHED ON A SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS BELONGING TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR ON A LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERNET WEBSITE SURELY COULD NOT THOSE REQUIREMENTS. WHICH COULD NOT BE INDEPENDENTLY COULD NOT VERIFIABLE THERE IS NO RECORD. WITHOUT STRONGER PROTECTIONS IT WILL BECOME A SIMPLE MATTER FOR AGENCIES TO PURPOSEFULLY OR INADVERTENTLY. AREA NOTICE ON A TWITTER FEED THAT NO ONE READ. THIS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE IT MATTERS MUCH MORE TALKING ABOUT THESE ROOSTERS BUT REST ASSURED THAT IS THE FOUNDER FOR PUBLICATION IS CHANGED IN THIS WAY HERE. WE WILL SPEAK OPPOSED NO TO SEE A CHANGE IN THE SAME WAY ELSEWHERE IN THE LAW WHEN MUCH MORE MAY BE AT STAKE. WE URGE YOU NOT TO CHANGE ANY NOTICE REQUIREMENT WITHOUT PUTTING IN THE CAREFUL THOUGHT AND ANALYSIS THAT IS NEEDED JUST LOOK AT ALL OF CALIFORNIANS NOTICE REQUIREMENTS WE RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE. THANK YOU. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESS. AND CHAIN. THAT OPPOSE. ANY OTHER. SHARE BERNIE BERNSTEIN CAL SORRY YOU ARE HERE OKAY GO AHEAD. HEY I AM SORRY ABOUT THAT- AGAIN GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WAS TRYING TO KEEP IT AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS- I'M GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION. TO EIGHTY TWO FIFTY THREE PER FEW REASONS- FIRST. AND FOREMOST WE FEEL THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO REACH INTO A COMMUNITY- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS AWARE OF IT YEP REQUIREMENTS IN A NOTICE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT. BROADBAND IN INTERNET ACCESS WHILE MORE PEOPLE MAYBE TRIBUNE ONLINE TOO DIGITAL FORMS OF COMMUNICATIONS THERE THIRTY THREE FELLOW THAT IF INTRODUCED SO FAR BEST SESSION. TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES. I AM BROADBAND ACCESS AND IT IS IN THE ARE MORE WORLD. THAT LIE THE STOCK THAT TO PRIVATE. THAT RELY ON ART PRINT OUR MEMBERS PUBLICATIONS TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED HI- FOR EXAMPLE. ALSO- IN FRESNO THE COSBY WHICH WAS MENTIONED REACHES FIFTY THOUSAND- PRINT SUBSCRIBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS- WHEREAS FRESNO SHERIFF'S- TWITTER FEED ONLY REACHES FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOLLOWERS ON IT A BIT ON THE BASIS- AND ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT LEAVES NEWSPAPERS THAT ARE A NEWSPAPER OF GENERAL CIRCULATION- IS A TERM OF ART AND THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND BY A QUARTER TO REACH UNSUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PAID SUBSCRIBERS IN THE AREAS THAT THAT THAT THE PUBLICATION INSTANCE A SIR- AND SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN CHAMBER. THAT OPPOSE. ANY WITNESSES IN. IN THE ROOM. NOPE AND THEIR DEAR AT&amp;T ARE ANY WITNESSES ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION. YOU ARE OPPOSITION IT AT ONE IT MAN. ZERO WE DO HAVE SOME PARTICULAR GOVERNOR TO BE JUST A MOMENT. COMING FROM THE LINE OF. TWO SIXTY TWO. YEAH. HOLD ON ONE FIFTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI AND REGINA BROWN WILSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA BLACK MEDIA- I WOULD LIKE TO JUST REGISTER THAT WE ARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION I'M THE BILL I'M NOT BECAUSE I'M JUST THIS PARTICULAR BILL BUT WHAT IT DOES IN GENERAL THE PUBLIC NOTICE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHERS QUEUED UP FOR OPPOSITION THANK YOU A QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I HAVE MISTER LEAVE PERSON. MR QUIRK IN IN THIS WEEK'S THANK YOU AND SOMEWHERE PATTERSON BRING THIS I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF HOW PERVASIVE AND LARGEST PROBLEM IS HOW MANY **** ARE BEING EUTHANIZED EVERY YEAR. AB HOW DO I KNOW. WELL I MEAN IT SAYS EVERY PUBLICATION IS ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH IS IT COSTING LAW EFORCEMENT AGENCIES WELL I THINK THE POINT THAT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE HERE IS. THAT FOR THREE. DAYS OF LIMITED LINAGE- THESE CHARGES ARE ASTRONOMICAL. THE REALITY IS THAT IT DEFEATS THE VERY PURPOSE OF THE NOTIFICATION. BECAUSE IT LIMITS THE BREADTH AND THE SCOPE AND THE- ABILITY NOTICE OUT TO CHOOSE THE GEOGRAPHY THE LANGUAGE. OF THE- DEMOGRAPHICS. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE APPROACHING AND I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND AS A YOUNG PERSON I DEFINITELY AND SYMPATHETIC TO MODERNIZING ANTIQUATED AND QUICK MENUS BUT I'M JUST WONDERING HOW OFTEN DO THEY HAVE TO DO THIS LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY IT'S ENOUGH. IT'S A- IT'S ENOUGH TO WHERE THE PRICE TAG. FOR THE FRESNO- SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS VERY VERY HIGH CENTRAL CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF THESE ACTIVITIES. THE BIRDS ARE ARE- TAKEN IT INTO THEIR CUSTODY. AND IT IS- INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT- TO JUSTIFY 800-021-1000 DOLLAR PRICE TAG FOR. LIMITED DISTRIBUTION. SO I THE OTHER IS WE'RE THE WE'RE BASICALLY ALLOWING PEOPLE. DO YOU HAVE CHOICES. IF THEY SEEK TO DO THIS IN A MORE DIRECT WAY OR DEMOGRAPHIC WHERE GEOGRAPHIC WAY- AND HAVE A OF A MULTITUDE OF CHOICES. R. AS COMPARED DOLLARS. PLUNK DOWN AT A NEWSPAPER THAT THAT HAS THAT- CERTAINLY HAS OF CIRCULATION BUT THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A- DIRECTED ARE TIED TO- WHERE THE- BIRDS WERE TAKEN WHERE THE- LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS THANK THAT THE OWNERSHIP. MAY RESIDE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO IT'S TARGETED LESS EXPENSIVE AND ULTIMATELY GETS TO THE POINT. WHERE THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT NOTIFICATION SHOULD DO GET TO THE PEOPLE DO IT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS EXPANSION OF DISTRIBUTION RATHER THAN CONTRACTION. AND BE ABLE TO GET THE- SATISFACTION THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THESE NOTIFICATIONS CANCEL THAT. INTEREST IN THE OWNERSHIP OF THOSE PLAN I UNDERSTAND DEFINITELY HAVING THE SATISFACTION OF EXPANDING THOSE OPTIONS OF NOTICING FOR ROOSTERS ARE **** OR OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE APPREHENDED- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF IT SO THAT'S WHY ASKING THE NUMBERS AND I DON'T MEAN IT AS AN OFFENSE I GENERALLY WANT TO KNOW HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS. SO IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THOSE NUMBERS TO US THAT WOULD BE GREAT- BUT I THINK THE PRINCIPAL'S REPORT OF PUBLIC NOTICING SO A FORTY TODAY I WON'T BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL- BUT DEFINITELY WOULD WANT TO KNOW HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS. LET ME LET ME STIPULATE THAT IT IS A REAL BIG PROBLEM YOU'VE DEALT WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF BIG ISSUES TODAY. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS VERY MUCH CONSTRAINED- THE COCKFIGHTING PROTECTIVELY PARTICULARLY IN THE VALLEY AND IN SOME AREAS IN THE URBAN AREAS AS WELL. AND PROVIDE FOR A- CHOICE- WHICH COULD INCLUDE THE NEWSPAPERS ARE COULDN'T COULD INCLUDE- MINORITY- SITES ONLINE SITES OTHERS SO THERE IS A- SET OF CHOICES. MADE TO GET TO THE END GAME WHICH IS. BE SATISFIED THAT YOU'RE REACHING THE PEOPLE THAT MOST LIKELY WILL HAVE OWNERSHIP AND INFORMATION SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE SOME INPUT INTO THE DECISION OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THOSE BIRDS. THE CERK- LET ME SEE IF I CAN CONVINCE MISTER LEE. WELL SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM NEWSPAPER CIRCULATION IS PROBABLY ATTEMPT WHAT IT WAS WHEN WE- SET UP THESE LAWS. MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE INTERNET ACCESS TO TAKE THE NEWSPAPER. YOU PROBABLY WELL IN THE IN THE- IN SCIENTIFIC TERMS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE THAT IS A FACTOR OF TEN IT COULD EVEN BE A HUNDRED BY THE TIME THIS DECADES OVER BECAUSE FRANKLY THE NEWSPAPERS KEEP ON CONSOLIDATING AND AS THEY CONSOLIDATE. THEY STOP COVERING LOCAL NEWS I WISH I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN EVERY CITY COUNCIL THERE WAS A TIME I COULD KNOW THAT. NOW I JUST HAVE TO CALL PEOPLE UP BECAUSE THE NEWSPAPER DOESN'T COVER IT YOU KNOW NO WONDER- CIRCULATIONS GOING DOWN WHEN THEY DON'T COVER THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS CARED ABOUT. ANYWAY GETTING BACK TO THAT A LOT MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND FOR THAT REASON AND THE OTHER THING IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE NOTICES I MEAN YOU'VE GOT COLUMN AFTER COLUMN BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE SAVE NOTICES SHOULD BE IN THE PAPER. HOW YOU CAN NEVER FIND IT. SO THIS IS A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM. I WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU COULD THINK ABOUT. A WAY TO MAKE THIS UNIFORM SO ANOTHER WORDS SOMEBODY WHO LOST A PET. IN BAKERSFIELD COULD DO RESEARCH. AND IF THE PET ENDED UP IN FRESNO WHICH IS ENTIRELY LIKELY. THAT IT'S IN NOT IN THE CITY THEY ARE IN THEY COULD DO IT AN EASIER SEARCHING THIS WOULD BE A MATTER OF. PEOPLE COMING UP WITH COMMON WORDS TO BE USED- BUT THIS IS JUST SO FAR AHEAD OF WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE NEWSPAPER. AND I JUST I LOVE IT GREAT BILL. YOU WERE ALWAYS BRINGING US BILLS HERE AND PUBLIC SAFETY I REALLY APPRECIATE IT YOU'VE BROUGHT US TWO REALLY GOOD ONES TODAY THANK YOU TO THE APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. WHICH WORKS THANKS OUR TOP THANK YOU- I DIDN'T VOTE FOR THIS BILL AND TO COMMITTEE LAST TIME. LAST YEAR- SO I DON'T THINK IT WAS YOU CAN'T UNANIMOUS- COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. THANK YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN ATTENDANCE I WAS HERE YEAH AND JUST LAID OFF YEP- OKAY BUT MY CONCERNS THAN WHICH ARE MY CONCERNS NOW- ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ACLU AND THE NEWSPAPERS HAVE RAISED AROUND THE SETTING PRECEDENT FOR HOW PUBLIC NOTICES- GIVEN IN OTHER SITUATIONS EVEN I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED. ISSUE THAT YOU'RE BEING FACED WITH CAN YOU JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE OPPOSITION HAVE RAISED. WELL I THINK THAT THAT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE OPPOSITION- THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY- ARGUING FOR A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUTDATED AND ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND BY THE VERY TECHNOLOGY THAT IS- ESSENTIALLY FORCING NEWSPAPERS TO STEW. PUBLISH LESS HARD COPIES AND GO ONLINE SO I FIND IT A BIT DISINGENUOUS WHEN- THE NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION SUGGESTS THAT- WE'RE TREADING INTO- AREAS HERE WITH RESPECT TO LIMITED CONNECTIVITY NOT EVERYBODY HAS. ACCESS TO THE TO THE INTERNET. THE REALITY IS THAT. ABOUT IT IS MUCH MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO UTILIZE A NEWSPAPERS ONLINE. ANNOUNCEMENTS THEN IT IS PUBLISHED ANNOUNCEMENTS BECAUSE OF WHAT I THINK HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE SO THESE ARE KIND OF. OUTDATED STANDARDS. OF ASSESSING EFFECTIVE NOTIFICATIONS OVER REALLY INTERESTED IN AFFECTED NOTIFICATION WE ARE MODERNIZE IN THIS PARTICULAR SPACE AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL ATTEMPTS TO AN END HAVE YOU SAT DOWN WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN TERMS OF THE NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION OTHERS WHO'VE SHARED THESE CONCERNS AND TRY TO WORK TOWARDS A COMPROMISE THAT WOULD WORK FOR THEM. THEY'VE NOT BEEN WILLING TO DO THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO DO THAT IS I HAVE A WITH WHICH WE'VE GOT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE B. AT LAST THE LAST TIME A YEAR AGO. BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE THIS IS NOTHING NEW HERE AND THE OPPOSITION IS THE SAME OLD- STODGY INSTITUTIONAL OPPOSITION THAT QUITE FRANKLY MISSES THE OPPORTUNITY HERE. OF EXPANDING AND EMPHASIZING AND DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION AS MR CORKER SUGGESTED. THIS MAY VERY WELL DEVELOPED. A INTO A- OUR ONLINE PRESENCE OF INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND COOPERATION AND CREATE TAG INFORMATION WHERE YOU COULD GO AND ACTUALLY SEARCH BUT UNLESS THERE IS AN OPTION. TO THE HARD PRINT MONOPOLY. NONE OF THAT CAN CAN GAIN TRACTION. MISTER CHAIR WOULD YOU MIND IF WE LET THE OPPOSITION SPEAK TO THAT I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR THEIR RESPONSE. WOULD YOU MIND IF WE LET THE OPPOSITION SPEAKS TO. SURE THE NUMBERS. THERE MIGHT STATE. IT CAN YOU GET BACK ONLINE. THREE GOOD AFTERNOON EVENING MISTER CHAIR THIS IS BRITNEY BAR BODY- BUT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLISHED THE THIRTY I'M A PLANS BY. EIGHT SIR AND COULD YOU SPELL THAT SURE AND I'M ALSO. YEAH COULD YOU SPEAK MISTER POTTER REMARK OF. WHAT HE SAID ABOUT YOUR GUISES PRESS AND I GUESS AND WE TO MEET TO TRY TO COME TO COME FROM ON THAT. YEAH I MEAN I A FEW. AGAIN ONE. I THEY ALSO TO CLEAR THAT THERE'S NOT IN THIS THAT KIRK- IT OR FOR- OTHER ORGANIZATIONS FROM IN ADDITION TO PREPAYMENT IN ANY PAPER FEDERAL CIRCULATION THEY CAN SHARE ONLINE AND IN FACT. THE MPA MAINTAINS THE WEBSITE CALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC NOTICE THAT MANY OF OUR MEMBERS AUTOMATICALLY UP MOST THEIR LEGAL PUBLIC NOTICES YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS SEARCHABLE AND INCLUDES ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNCTIONS. THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED. IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW IT'S OF COMING TO TERMS OF A RANGE- WE STILL. THAT NEWSPAPERS ARE THE BEST WAY OF REACHING THE MOST AMOUNT OF FOLKS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY WHEN A COURT OF LAW HAS DETERMINED THAT THEY REACH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PAID SUBSCRIBERS IN THE AREA THE NOTICE IS REQUIRED TO BE PUBLISHED FOR- AND THAT THE BROADBAND ISSUES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS EVIDENCED BY THE THIRTY THREE BILLS SEEKING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE- DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS STILL IN EQUITY YOU KNOW ONCE THOSE IN EQUITY HARD DRESS PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC NOTICES- BUT TO BE FAIR. WHILE I EAT A WHILE MAY BE BIG- WHAT GOING ANYWHERE ANYTIME SOON SO THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST ADD VERY QUICKLY WE DID HAVE A CONVERSATION- WITH THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL YOU KNOW WE COULD NOT REACH AGREEMENT ON ON WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE OBVIOUSLY- YOU KNOW WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT LEADING ACLU ARE OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT KIND OF NOTICE WOULD MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR INDEPENDENCE AND VERIFIABILITY. HAVING A RECORD OF THAT THAT NOTED BUT BUT I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT HIS YOU KNOW PROBABLY ALLOWING ANY KIND OF SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING OR POSTING ON A WEBSITE THAT THAT BELONGS TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AGENCIES DOES NOT MEET THE- OKAY I'LL I'LL I'LL BE VOTE NO ON THE BILL TODAY IN IN THE HOPES THAT- I COULD CHANGE THAT VOTE ON THE FLOOR- WITH FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH ACLU IN THESE PAPERS ASSOCIATION. THANK. SO IT QUESTIONS POSED TO YOU EARLIER ABOUT HOW OFTEN THIS HAPPENS OR OR WHAT THE PROBLEM THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM IS JUST SIX MONTHS AGO THERE WAS. TWO TO THREE THOUSAND COCKFIGHTING ROOSTERS THAT WERE PICKED UP. AND IN. CITY CHATS WORKS- FEW YEARS BEFORE THAT THERE IS A I THINK IT'S THREE YEARS AGO WAS SEVEN THOUSAND- I WORKED IN AN AREA WHERE THIS. TYPE OF ACTIVITY WAS REPORTED ROUTINE. AND YES POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD TO GO OUT THERE AND BREAK GOES UP ANIMAL CONTROL WOULD COME OUT. AND IN AND DAY OUT TO SMALLER AGENCY THAT- WAS THERE AND SO IT IT IS I THINK IT IS A PROBLEM I'LL BE VOTING FOR YOUR BILL TODAY- BECAUSE IT'S A ONE PROBLEM AND I THINK CAN BE- SALT FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE. BY BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE BROAD. AND USING THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH I JUST DID- TO FIND SOME OF THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION EARLIER- BUT DOES. THAT GET AS AVAILABLE TO US TO REDUCE SOME OF THESE COSTS FOR THE CITY'S IT TO THIS IS PERVASIVE AND- SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER PATTERSON I APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION FIRST OF ALL UP. MR SANTIAGO WHO'S BEHIND YOU WAITED C. HAS A QUESTION. YOU MAY HAVE TO COME TO A MIGHT SO WE CAN HEAR YOU. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ALL CLOSE TOGETHER. OKAY WE- OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU SEE HERE. THE QUICK QUESTIONS THE WAY AND HOPEFULLY CONSIDERATIONS MADE FOR DOWN AYE LOOK I'M GENERAL SUPPORT OF SOMEONE TO GIVE YOU BETTER DOWN CONTINUE MOVE FORWARD. BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT WILL CONCLUDE ON THE LINE YOU KNOW L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G FOR A HYBRID SORT&lt;/c&gt; OF MODEL WHERE IT MAKES SENSE IN SOME COMMUNITIES MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS- TO- TO THE INTERNET IS AS COMPARED TO THE OTHER SIDE FOR ME. MASCHINEN THE WAITER. WELL AGAIN I MEAN I IF. I GUESS MY BUT MY SHORT ANSWER IS I DON'T THINK SO- THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO ME TO BE A BIG HIGH HURDLE- TO GET OVER WITH RESPECT TO THE END PROCESS HERE. WHICH IS UTILIZING IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY. AT MANNER IN WHICH THIS DISSEMINATING- THAT THAT'S WIDE A POSSIBILITY. OF INFORMATION. I THERE NUMBER NUMBER TWO. THE THIS IS NOT. APPROACH THIS THIS IS THIS IS. THE CAN CHOOSE OF A ROW OF WAYS. BUT IF THEY DID A- A LIMITED PERHAPS A DEMOGRAPHIC AREA THEY PICKED UP THE BIRDS UP AND THEY WANT TO MANAGE. HOW THEY GO ABOUT MAKING THE NOTIFICATIONS. SECONDLY I THINK THERE ISN'T AN INTEREST IN. THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO- TO PUBLISH TO FIND WAYS THAT ARE. NEW- AT DIFFERENT BUT HAVE THE ABILITY TO- HAVE IT THE- NOTIFIED OR OR- SO THAT THEY CAN THAT THEY CAN HAVE A RECORD THAT IT WAS IN FACT. A PUBLISHED- THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THESE OTHER. OPPORTUNITY SUGGEST WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS A THAT THIS IS A TWEET. BUT THIS IS A PERMISSIVE EFFORT TO GO AND FIND AFFORDABLE WAYS. TO DO THE SAME THING M. I JUST WOULD COME BACK TO THE- PRICE TAG OF 800-021-1000 DOLLARS- FOR ACTIVITY THAT. THERE COULD BE- DISTRIBUTED IN A IN IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS YEAH I GUESS THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER. WE'RE GONNA LOOK TO TOMORROW WE'RE GOING TO GOING TO LOOK TO YESTERDAY. PERMISSIBLE THE WORD I WAS LOOKING FOR HIS FOR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WITH WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE MISSED BETTER. I'LL I'LL I'LL I'LL LET THAT BE MY CLOSE THIS THIS IS- AN OPPORTUNITY- THAT IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE THAT IT IS LIMITED IN SCOPE THIS IS NOT. A REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH HERE TO. CHANGE ALL OF THE OTHER NOTIFICATIONS. BUT IT IS A UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

THANK YOU. NOW WILL HAVE. COMMENTS FROM OPPOSITION. LABOUR CDA AND JONATHON FELDMAN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. TERMINA MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO AB TWO NINE TWO OR LESS AMENDED THE BILL WOULD INCREASE STATE PRISON CON BUT IT'S FOR VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS SENTENCED PURSUANT TO THE THREE STRIKES LAW EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FITZ PARTICIPATE. IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS SUCH AS PART YEAH WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE PARTS OF THE BILL THAT WOULD LESSEN DISRUPTIONS IN STATE PRISON PROGRAMMING AND CREDITS INCREASINGLY CREDITS FOR INMATES WERE NOT PHYSICALLY BETTER ABLE BODIED AND THEREFORE CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN FIREFIGHTING TRAINING DESTROYS PROPORTIONALITY IRONICALLY THE PROPOSED CREDIT INCREASE CREATES A DISINCENTIVE FOR INMATES TO PARTICIPATE IN FIREFIGHTING TRAINING AT THE TIME AND HAVE A CALIFORNIA DESPERATELY NEED THEIR SERVICES. TO THE CONTINUED RAVAGES OF OUR DEADLY WILDFIRES REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AFTER PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALREADY PROVIDE GENEROUS CONDUCT CREDIT WITH STATE PRISON INMATE AFTER ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN THEY NOW EARN TWENTY PERCENT. INMATES SERVING SENTENCES PUTS SO THE THREE STRIKES LAW NOW EARN THIRTY THREE POINT 3% CONDUCT CREDITS AND THOSE INMATES SERVING SENTENCES FOR NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT FELONIES EARN 50% CREDIT AN INMATE SERVING A TERM FOR A VIOLENT FELONY- SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES FIREFIGHTER TRAINING EARNS 50% CREDIT. AN INMATE WOULD OTHERWISE CURRENTLY QUALIFIED WITH A 50% CREDITS EARNED SIXTY SIX POINT 6% CREDIT UPON SUCCESSFUL CONFLICT OF FIREFIGHTER TRAINING AS WE READ THE BILL IT WOULD MAKE THESE CREDITS AVAILABLE TO INMATES WHO DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN PARK. WIDE AND WITH IT IT MAKES YOU FEEL IN. DANGER HIMSELF WITH THE SAME CREDIT CAN BE AN INCOME IN PRESENT GROW. CDA CONTENDER IS THAT FALL TO MY THE ARE. THIS. YEAH SURE MEMBERS- GOOD EVENING IT'S GETTING LATE SO I'LL BE BRIEF- pCOLLEAGUE- THE CDA- YOU KNOW THESE CREDITS WERE JUST ADJUSTED AFTER PROP FIFTY SEVEN TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE THEY WERE JUST INCREASED PROPORTIONALLY ALL CATEGORIES OF OFFENDERS- ANOTHER CONCERN WITH BUMPING THE CREDITS UP- SO DRAMATICALLY PROVIDING OFFENDERS IS THAT. THESE ARE SOME OF THOSE HEINOUS CRIMES AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES TIME INCARCERATED AND PROGRAMMING IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS PUT FULLY REHABILITATED BEFORE I WE CAN LOOK AT GRANTED CONTROL. OF PROBATION OR SEND THEM- I'VE GOTTEN TO ASSIST. SO WE HAVE SOME CONCERN WITH RAMPING UP THE CREDITS- SO SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR THOSE CATEGORIES OUTLINED. IN THE BILL. HOWEVER WE DO FIND MANY OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE BILL THE BILL VERY COMMENDABLE- AND- YOU KNOW. BY NO MEANS HAVE CONCERNS WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BUT- WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE BILL I'M JUST BASICALLY THOSE SECTIONS. SO WE ARE OPPOSED THANK. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN. THE CHAMBER. THAT ARE NOT POSITION ANY WITNESSES ON THE- ON THE VIDEO CONFERENCING IN OPPOSITION. AT&amp;T DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION. OF THE BILL. FLORIDA OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN IF. ZERO AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE QUEUING UP THE STRUCTURE. THIRTY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. C. N. NINE C. IN. ONE GO AHEAD AND A QUICK QUESTION MR STONE ON SOMETHING THAT WAS SENT BY THE OPPOSITION- WHEN INMATES RECEIVE THESE CREDITS IT MAKES THEM ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE RIGHT DOESN'T GRANT THE RELEASE THAT'S CORRECT SO THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE HEARING AND BE GRANTED PRO BY THE PROBOARDS. OPERATION WELL THE IT IS TAKING TIME OFF OF THEIR SENTENCE POTENTIALLY SO IT IS GETTING THEM IDEALLY TO A PRO BOWL EARLIER BUT IT ALSO MAY REDUCE. OVERALL THEIR SENSE OF. WHAT THE REAL ANSWER TO THAT IS THAT WHEN. PEOPLE ARE CURSORY DO TAKE THIS PROGRAMMING AND DO THE WORK WHETHER IT'S FIRE CAMP FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THEIR RECIDIVISM RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. SO BY FINDING WAYS TO ENCOURAGE PROGRAMMING AND GET PEOPLE THROUGH. THESE PROCESSES WE'RE ACTUALLY CREATING. A SAFER PUBLIC BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO RE OFFEND- RECOMMIT THAT'S THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM. RIGHT AND I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MOTIVATE INDIVIDUALS ARE FRUSTRATED TO DO THE WORK TO BE BETTER CITIZENS AND- THE SUCCESS ON THE OUTSIDE IT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY SAFER. IT INCREASED IT MAKES FOR BETTER OUTCOMES AND IT SAVES US MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CRUSHING PEOPLE FOR QUITE AS LONG- BUT I GUESS I JUST WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR. IF WE GET THESE CREDITS THEY SOMEONE IS SENTENCED TO TEN YEARS AND I THINK IF THEY WERE THAT A MODEL PRISONER BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET A TRUE 50% YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE A MODEL PRISONER- SO THEY GET. REDUCED TO FIVE YEARS IN FIVE YEARS THERE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. A HEARING THEY DON'T JUST WALK AFTER FIVE YEARS BECAUSE THEY THESE CREDITS ARE TO MY MISUNDERSTANDING WELL THE CREDIT BY EARNING THE CREDITS YOU CAN BE A REDUCTION. IN THE SENTENCE ITSELF GOT IT OKAY. SO THEN THEY COULD YOU WALK THEY HAVE THE RICH RECORD WITHOUT A PAROLE HEARING. DOT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY YOU MAY CLOSE THE SYSTEM I ASKED FOR AND I WILL. THANK YOU THIS IS I THINK IN ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP INTO- INTO CORRECTIONS AND IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT WHO ARE. WHO DESERVE TO BE UP SO HIGH I THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS EFFORT IN. CHAIR RECOMMENDS AN IBOOK. ON AB TWO NINETY TWO BY SO MEMBERS DOWN THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQI. OUR QUE HAN BACKING HAD AYE CORK. AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I THINK OUR TO SEE OUR TONO WICKS. LI LI I. IMAGE THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS SO AB FIVE OH THREE IS A BILL THAT ESTABLISHES STATUTORY GUIDANCE FOR NONCUSTODIAL WAR CHIP PROGRAM THANK YOU OF OUR YOUTH UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENS WITH YOU THINK PROBATION OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF WHAT CONNECTIONS THEY CAN BE A PROBATION FOR TWO THREE YEARS OR MORE AND YET THE BIGGEST SUCCESS WE HAVE ISSUES IS WHEN WE DIVERT THEM FROM BEING INCARCERATED IN FACT AS SOON. AS A CHILD. IS INCARCERATED. IN JUVENILE HALL OR ANY OTHER. A PROGRAM THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RESET OF IT IS HARMFUL TO THEM IT IS HARMFUL TO THEIR FUTURE IT'S HARMFUL TO THEIR FAMILY SO WHAT AB FIVE OH THREE IS GOING TO DO IS END THE SORT OF ENDLESS POTENTIAL CYCLE OF PROBATION FOR USE AND IT PROVIDES. A SIX MONTH. REQUIREMENT THAT THAT KIDS WILL NOT BE HELD LONGER THAN THE SIX MONTHS OR BE ON PROBATION LONGER THAN THE SIX MONTHS UNLESS THEY ARE REVIEWED. AND THERE BECOMES THAN A REASON FOR THEM TO STAY ON LONGER. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT IF WITHOUT THIS REVIEW KIDS ARE LANGUISHING ON PROBATION. ARE CONNECTED TO THE COURTS WITH ALL THE STIGMA. AND THE TRAUMA AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT THAT REPRESENTS SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET THEM OFF OF PROBATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SET REASONABLE PROBATION TERMS AND ENSURE THAT THESE YOUTHS ARE NOT GOING TO BE THEN CAUGHT UP FOREVER IN THESE ENDESS CYCLES THAT PROBATION OFF THAT THE PROBATION TERMS CAN OFTEN REPRESENT. THIS IS ALSO A BILL. ABOUT RACE IN CALIFORNIA MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THAT A- BLACK OR BROWN YOUTH IS PUT ON PROBATION AND PUT ON PROBATION TERMS. SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER AND SIGNIFICANTLY. MORE RESTRICTIVE THAT AWAIT YOU. AND THIS IS REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE RACIAL DISPARITY AS WELL AS THE PROCLIVITY OF SOME. COURTS AND SOME PROBATION SYSTEMS TO TIE YOU UP FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN THE NAME OF THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD IT IS AN INVESTMENT FOR THE CHILD IT'S THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING FOR THE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SYSTEM. SO ALL WE'RE DOING IS CREATING A- CHANGING THAT THE EXPECTATION OF HOW LONG A CHILD CAN BE ON PROBATION UNLESS THERE'S AN INDICATION FOR LONGER AND WE'VE HEARD FROM JUDGES WHO DIDN'T DON'T LIKE THE SIX THE SIX MONTHS THEY'D RATHER HAVE ITIS A YEAR. AND IN THEIR WORDS THEY DON'T SEE THAT KID FOR ANOTHER YEAR WELL THAT AGAIN IS FOR THE BENEFIT THE JUDGE NOTFOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CHILD THAT ATTITUDE CANNOT BE PERVASIVE ANY LONGER AS WE'RE DEALING WITH KIDS ON PROBATION WE NEED TO GET THEM OUT WE NEED TO GET THEM BACK. INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE SPECTER AND THE UMBRELLA OF THE PROBATION SYSTEM WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU. AND YOUR WITNESSES.

GOOD EVENING CHEN NUMBERS GREGORY PELOPONNESIAN JUST INSTRUCTED PORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND NOW. IN OPPOSITION- OUR GOOD FRIEND AND STAR OF THE DAY LARRY MORSE CD A. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I HARDLY FEEL THAT WAY BUT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB FIVE OH THREE UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO ELIMINATE OR A MAN PROPOSED WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION SIX OH TWO POINT ZERO FIVE WHICH WOULD LIMIT TO SIX MONTHS. OF PROBATION PERIOD IN A JOB CASE NO MATTER HOW SERIOUS OR VIOLENT A JUVENILE CRIMINAL HISTORY IS THIS IS A SWEEPING AND TROUBLING PROPOSAL WHICH CONTAINS NO DISQUALIFYING CRIMES AS WE READ THE BILL. IF ENACTED A MINOR ON PROBATION FOR MURDER SEXUAL ASSAULT ARMED ROBBERY GANG SHOOTINGS OR VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER WOULD BE TREATED THE SAME AS A MINOR ON PROBATION FOR PETTY THEFT OR ASSAULT. JUDGES SHOULD HAVE THE SPECS WHAT THE BILITY INDISCRETION TO TAILOR SENTENCES AND PROBATION PERIODS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR EACH JUVENILE OFFENDER A BLANKET SIX MONTH PROBATION PERIOD IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CRIME CIRCUMSTANCE. SENATE DESTRY OF THE JUVENILE OFFENDER WILL NOT ADVANCE THROUGH CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM SIX MONTHS IS FAR TOO SHORT A PERIOD TO ENSURE THE REHABILITATION OF KERR'S FOR THE CRIME VICTIMS ARE PROTECTED. THE BILL PERMITS EXTENSION OF THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ONLY IF IT IS IN THE MINORS BEST INTEREST GLARINGLY ABSENT FROM THE BILL LANGUAGE IS ANY CONSIDERATION OF PUBLIC SAFETY FOR CRIME VICTIMS INTEREST OR SAFETY. PROBATION IS NOT PUNISHMENT TO THE CONTRARY COURTS TO RULE THE PROBATION IS AN ACT OF CLEMENCY AND GRACE JUDGESCANNOT SIMPLY IMPOSE ANY AND ALL PROBATION CONDITIONS THE ESTABLISHED TEST IS WHETHER THE PARTICULAR PROBATION CONDITION IS BALLOT. AND RELATES TO THE CRIME COMMITTED TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ITSELF OR TO THE PROBATIONERS FUTURE CRIMINALITY SIX MONTHS IS INADEQUATE TO ENSURE THE REHABILITATION THE KURDS OR THE CRIME VICTIMS ARE PROTECTED. IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IN MANY. CASES FOR A MINOR TO PARTICIPATE IN MEANING RESULTS. PROGRAM OR TO REPAY UP. OF THE REST OF OWED A CRIME VICTIM. EVEN MORE TROUBLING. TO MANY CASES INVOLVING ASSAULTS B JUVENILES NECESSARILY INCLUDE PROBATION CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE THE OFFENDER TO STAY AWAY FROM THE VICTIM. AGAIN AS WE READ THE BILL GOES PROTECTIONS WOULD DISAPPEAR AFTER SIX MONTHS. THE INTERESTS OF THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ARE NOT PART OF THIS BILL'S QUESTION. WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT IF THERE IS TO BE AT THE FALL PERIOD OF PROBATION IT SHOULD BE FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS AND SHOULD NOT APPLY IN CASES WHERE A MINOR IS COMMITTED A SERIOUS FELONY. A VIOLENT FELONY OR ANY OFFENSE LISTED AND WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE SEVEN OH SEVEN B. MOREOVER A JUDGE SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY IN EVERY CASE TO IMPOSE A PROBATION PERIOD OF LONGER THAN TWO YEARS BY STATING SE REASONS ON THE RECORD. AND THE STANDARD SHOULD CONSIDER MORE THAN JUST WHAT IS IN THE MINORS BEST INTEREST PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE INTERESTS AND SAFETY OF CRIME VICTIMS MUST BE FACTORS A COURT IN THE WAY. OF PROVISIONS THAT IS ABSENT FROM THIS BILL. CDA BELIEVES THAT MEANINGFUL REHABILITATION IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. PROSECUTORS FORCE MORE DISTINCT US THIS AND THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY IS ARE THEY REPRESENT HAVE THE GREATEST INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE IS DONE TO PREVENT JUVENILE OFFENDERS. FROM BECOMING ADULT OFFENDERS THAT GOAL IS BEST ACHIEVED WITH CREATIVE AND RESPONSIVE REHABILITATION PROGRAM AND IMPLEMENTED DURING A REALISTIC TIME FRAME WITH JUDGES ALLOWED TO BALANCE AND RECONCILE THE WELFARE OF THE JUVENILE OFFENDERS. THE INTEREST OF CRIME VICTIMS AND PUBLIC SAFETY ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. WE RESPECTFULLY OUTWARD NOTEBOOK. THANK YOU MOORE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESS ENOUGH IS. AND SO THE ROOM. A. N. D VIDEO CONFERENCING. AT&amp;T WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES DO YOU HAVE ANY THEIR IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. HAPPY ADDITION IS ONE ADVANTAGE ZERO. WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE QUEUING UP FOR OPPOSITION AS OF RIGHT NOW. OKAY THEN QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. C. EIGHTY NINE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND REALIZE THIS IS FOR NON CUSTODIAL WARSHIP PROBATION AND THE FULL LENGTH OF TIME IS REALLY VERY IMPORTANT AS OR THEIR CONDITIONS BECAUSE YOU THERE SOMETIMES SUBTLE WITH UP TO FIFTY CONDITIONS ARE THEY GOING TO VIOLATE THOSE SOMEBODY TEENAGER PROBABLY WITHOUT INTENSE. BUT THAT CAN THEN LEAD THEM TO BE INCARCERATED THAT CAN LEAD TO SORT OF ENDLESS CYCLES OF PROBATION THIS IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. VENT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE REHABILITATION ESPECIALLY OF OUR YOUTH IS GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BEING LOCKED DOWN. UNDER PROBATION TERMS THAT THEY FIND VERY IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET. JUST% BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN A VERY PATERNALISTIC MANNER WANTS TO IMPOSE ON THEM IS REALLY NOT THE PATH TO SUCCESS THE PATH TO SUCCESS IS A LIMITED TIME LINE A REVIEW OF THAT SITUATION AND IF THAT CHILD NEEDS MORE SERVICES THAN THAT CHILD WILL GET MORE SERVICES AND THAT CAN EXTEND. THE TIME INFORMATION THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE I APPRECIATE THIS AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT WERE WORKING PRETTY CLOSELY WITH THE POP THE PROBATION CHIEFS. WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS BUT- UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND DON'T DISAGREE. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE DEALING WITH THESE KIDS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS WORKABLE THE PROBATION CHIEFS UNDERSTAND. AND THAT THE COMMUNITIES WERE WORKING WITH ALSO UNDERSTAND IN WAYS THAT CAN LEAD TO SUCCESS FOR THE CHILDREN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AS WE'RE REFORMING. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MOVING IT INTO THE HUMAN SERVICES BROWN THIS IS PART IN PARCEL TO THAT KIND OF A MOVE THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. IGHT NOW AND I ASK FOR YOUR HUSBAND'S. THANK YOU- READ SIX. WE GOT A FIRST AND SECOND MESSICK CALLED. ON pMEMBERS STAND THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER. A LACKEY. OUR QUE HAN THANK YOU HIM HI CORK. CORK I SAN DIEGO SANTIAGO I SEE- TO SEE OUR TURNOUT WICKS HI WICKS HI LI LI I. THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU THANK YOU BOB THIS IS ERICA UDEN EUROPE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. TESTED IS THE DISADVANTAGE TO BE HONEST COMMITTEE YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER THE BODY OF. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FOR HEARING AB FOUR NINE THIS EVENING. THANK YOU ISRAEL IS A SIMPLE ADDITION TO THE PENAL CODE TO ENSURE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES OF GAIN CRIMES REMAIN SAFE. THE BILL ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VICTIMS OR WITNESSES OF GAME CRIMES TO BRING EVIDENCE OF A THREAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ORDER TO HAVE THEIR NAMES REMOVED FROM PUBLIC RECORDS. IN A RECENT PAYMENTS STUDY NEARLY 40% OF PARTICIPANTS LISTED FEAR RETALIATION AS A REASON THEY WERE NOT REPORTED CRIME. FOR PROVIDE INFORMATION THEY KNOW ABOUT A CRIME. WE KNOW THAT COULD GAIN CRIMES ARE NOTORIOUS FOR RETALIATION EFFORTS IN ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SOLVE AND I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND. BY OFFERING THIS COMMUNITY ARE BY OFFERING THE COMMUNITY THIS SIMPLE PROTECTION WE CAN HELP FOSTER COOPERATION BETWEEN ITS MEMBERS. AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AB FOUR NINE DOES NOT PLACE ANY EXTRA BURDENS OR NEW PROCEDURES ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. EMPLOYEES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO INFORM VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS THAT THEIR NAMES WILL BECOME PUBLIC RECORD UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUESTED AND THIS BILL FOLLOWS THE SAME BASIC PROCEDURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I'D LIKE TO PASS IT OVER TO RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION WHO IS HERE TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. IF YOU MISTER MEMBERS BRIAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA COALITION SCHOOL SAFETY PROFESSIONALS. THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF THE PALACE VERDES AT SANTA ANA POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. HE SAID ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENT SOUTH BEACH DEDICATED CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS FOR PLEASED TO SUPPORT EIGHTY FOUR NINE BILLS SEEK TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF VICTIMS AND WITNESSES. OF GANG CRIMES. THE COOLEY AB FOUR NINE WOULD ALLOW THE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES OF GANG CRIMES TO PETITION LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITIES PURSUANT TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. YES THEY FEEL THEIR LIFE COULD BE IN SERIOUS DANGER BECAUSE OF THEIR REPORTING INFORMATION RELATED TO A GANG CRIME. AS THE AUTHORS POINT OUT CURRENT LAW REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INFORM VICTIMS OF SEX OFFENSES BUT THE RIGHT TO REQUEST WITH THEIR NAME DOES NOT BECOME A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD. HOWEVER THERE IS NO SIMILAR PROTECTION FOR WITNESSES OR VICTIMS REPORTING ANY OTHER CRIMES. AB FOUR NINE THIS COMMONSENSE MEASURE THAT WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY BY PROTECTING WITNESSES AND VICTIMS ARE WILLING TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT CRIMINAL GANG ACTIVITY. THE BILL ALSO HELP REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RETALIATION FROM THESE DANGEROUS GANGS. PLEASE REASONS. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB FOUR NINE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU UNDER ANY OTHER WITNESSES. IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM ANY ON THE- ON THE VIDEO CONFERENCING. AND AT&amp;T HOW MANY DO WE HAVE ON. IT SUPPORT READY TO TEST BY. IF YOU AREN'T A PART IT IS ONE AND THEN ZERO AND WE HAVE A WAR ON THE LINE QUEUING UP IT'LL BE JUST A MOMENT. IT COMES FROM THE LINE OF THE TWO EIGHTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES SIR MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LARRY MORSE YET AGAIN- ON SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO OTHER FIVE IN Q. AND THEN.

WE DO HAVE ONE LINE IN OPPOSITION AND IT IS MY NUMBER ONE HUNDRED PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE TEACHER MEMBERS ARE NOT CERTAIN AND IS ON BEHALF OF C. AND J. IN OPPOSITION ISLAND I AM HERE- JUST BRIEFLY- YOU KNOW. OUR CONCERN IS THE WAY THE BILL IS DRAFTED IS THAT IT IS ACTUALLY NOT TO BE ALLEGED VICTIM OF A GANG RELATED A CHANCE THAT INITIATES THE REQUEST TO KEEP HIS OR HER NAME- OUT OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. INSTEAD IT IS LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT MUST INITIATE THEN ASK SOMEONE. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT THEIR NAME BE ACTED ON OR CONCERNS THAT THERE COULD BE SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY AN ALLEGED GANG RELATED CASES MORE THAN SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH INDIVIDUALS THE MESS IDENTIFIED AS BEING MEMBERS OF THE GANG AT POINT OF AROUND- THAT INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ASKED. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL SAY HEY YOUR NAME CAN BE PUBLIC UNLESS YOU SAY THAT YOU FELT THREATENED. ARE YOU STILL AT YOU'RE NOT SAFE AND WE FEEL THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE THERE WILL BE A HANDFUL OF INDIVIDUALS A PERCENTAGE OF ANIMALS WHO ARE GOING TO RESPOND IN THE AFFIRMATIVE EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY- WANT THEIR NAME. ARE THEY DON'T WANT ANY PUBLIC AUTHORITY OF REASONS- AND SO THE CONCERN IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A PROBLEM WITH INDIVIDUALS BEING MISIDENTIFIED AS GANG MEMBERS THE CONCERN WOULD BE THAT IN A CASE GOING FORWARD. THE STATEMENT THAT THE ALLEGED VICTIM CLAIMED IT HERE SHE FEARED FOR HER SAFETY. IN RESPONSE TO THE AFFIRMATIVE AT ASK REQUEST OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER COULD BE USED AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS ARRESTED AD SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ASSURANCES THAT IT WON'T BE- AND I THINK WE NEED TO. BE CLARIFIED THAT IF IT'S AT THE REQUEST OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AS OPPOSED TO REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ASK SOMEONE WHETHER OR NOT THEY FEAR FOR THE LIVES OF WHETHER OR NOT TELLING THEM YOUR NAME WILL GO PUBLIC AND LESS YOU TELL ME. THAT YOU CALL FOR YOUR LIFE I WOULD JUST THINK IT CREATES A LOT OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE THIS IS KIND OF A VERY UNIQUE TYPE OF CRIME IT AS FAR AS THE MISAPPLICATION OF GANG IDENTITY IN SO MANY CASES. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE. CONCERNED A COUPLE OF OTHER REASONS BUT I PRIMARILY. THANK YOU MISTER HERNANDEZ. I BELIEVE IT- NUMBER IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY. MISTER JUST LIKE WHICH WE CAN. NO ARE JUST LIKE TO SPEAK IN OF THE BILL- IF I WERE YOU A SITUATION- WITH LAUNCH I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA. OF WHETHER OR NOT MY NAME WOULD BE PUBLISHED I MIGHT EVEN ASSUME THAT IT'S KEPT PRIVATE. SO LETTING SOMEONE KNOW SO THEY CAN MAKE THE CASE. TO ME IS AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION SO THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL. THIS WAY. JUST ON THE LETTER THAT OPPOSITION HAD- SUBMITTED- THEY SAID EXISTING LAW ALREADY ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THE WHOLE THE DIS CLOSURE OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD ENDANGER PERSON INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION. SO IT IS IT TRUE THAT EXISTING LAW WOULD ALREADY ALLOW FOR THIS. A LOT OF A LOT OF LONG FOR. YES THIS IS THE THIRD THING- WHAT. GO TO IT TO DO IT AND ALLOW VICTIMS AND WITNESS. TO PROVIDE PARTICULARLY BRAND TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SO IT IS MORE PROACTIVE ON THE WITNESS OR VICTIM WHO MAY KNOW THAT THERE IS A THREAT TO NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT GET LEFT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT OKAY GO DOWN. YEAH CAN THEY DO THAT NOW THEY'LL- VICTIMS NOT ADVOCATE ALONG CEMENT FOR NAME TO BE. NOW THAT'S WHY THAT'S ONE OF THE THAT ONE OF THE THAT A FOUR NINETY TO HELP- PROTECT THEMSELVES. IS AN SORRY IS IT NOT SURE YOU SAW ON CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT. YES ON DOWN THE LINE MY UNDERSTANDING THE WAY THIS BILL IS CRAFTED. IT SAYS YES- I THINK I BELIEVE IT IS A PERMANENTLY REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ASK VICTIMS. IF THEY ARE TO TELL THE VICTIM THE CANONICAL PUBLIC UNLESS STATE FAIR FEARFUL AND THAT TO ACTUALLY GO THE OTHER WAY IT IS INSTEAD OF GRANTS THE VICTIM. SURVIVED TO TELL LAW ENFORCEMENT OF THE CAN CAN CALDERON PERSON NOW SO I READ IT DIFFERENTLY IF I'M READING IT CORRECTLY AND HAPPY TO BE CORRECTED BUT THAT. IS MY READ OF IT- I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. LOOK FOR THE WORDS ARTICULABLE THREAT DESPITE. THANK YOU. YEAH I WOULD SAY SHALL INFORM THE VICTIMS AND THAT THAT'S ONE THING IT'S AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TELL THE VICTIM THAT HEY YOU'RE YOUR NAME COULD GO PUBLIC UNDER A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST IT IS ALSO USED UNDER THE SKINNER BILL SO THAT'S THE OTHER ISSUE GO OUT BUT NOT NOT IN THE SUBDIVISION A OF TWENTY SIX POINT THREE SEVEN WHICH IS ADDED BY THIS BILL. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE HI I JUST- RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE AYE VOTE ON THIS THANK YOU OKAY STICK TO A CALL THE ROLL. AN EIGHTY FOUR OH NINE BY SOME MEMBERS C. R. TO THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. GENSER I LACKEY LACKEY HI BARRICADE CAN GUARANTEE HANNAH I WORK I WORK HI SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO I SEE ARE TO. THEY ARE TO I LICKS. WEEKS NOT VOTING LEAVE. WE THE MEASURE PASSES. AND FOR FINAL BILL. ASSEMBLY WOMAN BUFFY WICKS. THE SUN YEAH OKAY TO MAKE THIS QUICK THANK YOU AT SHERRIN COMMITTEE STAFFER YOU WORK ON THIS BILL I'D ALSO LIKE TO AMEND THE BILL TO INCLUDE DECEMBER SANTIAGO IS A CO AUTHOR WHO EXPRESSED INTEREST TO MY STAFF ON THIS. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES JUDGES TO IMPOSE A SENTENCE FOR THE OFFENSE CARING THE LONGEST POTENTIAL TERM OF IMPRISONMENT WHEN A DEFENDANT IS ACCUSED. OF MULTIPLE OFFENSES DURING A SINGLE ACTS. THIS TOUGH ON CRIME ERA POLICY. REMOVED THE DISCRETION THAT JUDGES PREVIOUSLY HAD TO CHARGE THE DEFENDANT. WITH THE SENTENCE DEEMED MOST APPROPRIATE. CONTINUING TO PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR THE LONGEST AMOUNT OF TIME REGARDLESS OF THE CONTEXT OF THE CRIME. AND HISTORY OF THE OFFENDER DOES NOT RESULT OF THE PERSON. OR GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO BE BETTER IN THE FUTURE. OVER THE LAST DECADE CALIFORNIA'S TAKEN STEPS TO REVERSE. THE HARSH POLICIES OF THE PAST BY RESTORING JUDICIAL DISCRETION. AND INDIVIDUALIZED SENTENCING. AB FIVE EIGHTEEN RESTORES THE DISCRETION THAT JUDGES PREVIOUSLY HAD GIVEN THEM THE ABILITY TO FAIRLY SENTENCE AND TO EXERCISE DISCRETION WHEN DETERMINING A SENTENCE. FOR AN ACT PUNISHABLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS BY DIFFERENT PROVISIONS OF LAW. WE MUST CONTINUE FORWARD AND WORK TOWARDS MODERNIZING OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM BY ENSURING THAT SENTENCING SENTENCES ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE ACT. FIVE PHONE TODAY I HAVE STUFF ON MONDAY HELP EXECUTOR OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN TOO MANY MEMBERS MY NAME'S STEPHEN MUNCUL ON THE SECOND RECTRICES J. REGIONAL SPONSOR OF THE BILL I'M ALSO CERTIFIED SPECIALIST IN CRIMINAL LAW AND I'VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR FORTY THREE YEARS. SECOND SIX FIFTY FOUR IS A PART OF CALIFORNIA'S PROTECTIONS AGAINST DOUBLE JEOPARDY AND EXCESSIVE PUNISHMENT. OUR CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS BEING TRIED MORE THAN ONCE FOR THE SAME CRIME. AND SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR CREDITS BEING PUNISHED MORE THAN ONCE FOR THE SAME ACT. CONDITIONALLY THE PROSECUTOR HAS THE POWER TO DECIDE WHAT CHARGES TO FILE AND HOW TO PROSECUTE A CASE. AFTER CONVICTION THE COURT THEN DECIDES INAPPROPRIATE SENSE SPECIFICALLY PENAL CODE NINE FIFTY FOUR ALLOWS THE PROSECUTOR TO FILE AND PURSUE MULTIPLE CHARGES BASED ON A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT. FOR EXAMPLE IS A TOOL BOXES STOLEN FROM GARAGE AND LATER RECOVERED FROM THE SUSPECT SECTION NINE FIFTY FOUR ALLOWS THEM TO BE CHARGED AND CONVICTED OF BOTH BURGLARY AND RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY. BUT WHAT IN. IS CONVICTED OF BOTH CHARGES SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR SAYS I CAN ONLY BE PUNISHED OR ONE OF THEM. BECAUSE THEY ARE RISE FROM A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT. OF THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE SENTENCING JUDGE HAVE DISCRETION IN THE SITUATION TO CHOOSE WHICH CRIME SHOULD BE SENTENCED AND WHICH SHOULD BE STATE. THE AMENDMENT IN NINETY SEVEN REMOVE DISCRETION FROM THE JUDGE AND INSTEAD REQUIRES THAT SENTENCE TO BE IMPOSED. ON THE CRIME WITH A LONGER SENTENCE THIS CHANGE IN EFFECT INCREASE THE POWER PROSECUTORS GAVE THE MORE LEVERAGE IN PLEA BARGAINING. DECREASED THE ROLE OF THE COURTS AS A CHECK ON PROSECUTORIAL ABUSE AND HELPED FUEL THE RISING PRISON POPULATION. AB FIVE EIGHTEEN IS ONE SMALL STEP IN THE EVIDENCE BASED REFORMS OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM TAKING US A LITTLE FARTHER FROM THE FAILED POLICIES OF MASS INCARCERATION. IT WOULD RESTORE TO THE SENTENCING JUDGE A BIT OF DISCRETION IN CHOOSING A PUNISHMENT APPROPRIATE TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS IN THE PARTICULAR CRIME BEFORE THE COURT. ARGUMENTS BY OPPONENTS OF THE BILL ARE YOUR THE PROVEN HARMS OF EXCESSIVE SENTENCING INCLUDING THAT LONGER SENTENCES PRODUCE HIGHER RATES OF REOFFENDING. THEY ALSO IGNORE THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF SHIFTING POWER FROM THE COURT TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THIS IS A SENSIBLE AMENDMENT AND WE ASK FOR OUR VOTE. YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER. IN THE CHAMBER OF THE ANY OTHER. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN SUPPORT. ON THE VEHICLE COPSEY ARE THERE ANY INDIVIDUALS HERE IN SUPPORT AT&amp;T COULD YOU OPEN UP LINES FOR ANYONE I WANT TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. FINALLY THERE IS ONE NUMBER TWO SEVENTY THREE PLACE BECAUSE I HAD. GOOD EVENING MICHAEL DR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THEN THE NEXT LINE IS ONE EIGHTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD EVENING ANTHONY DIMARTINO WITH CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY OBJECTIVES IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. M. LINE NUMBER SIXTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. CANACCORD ARE NOW I'M HAVING THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU LETTER LINE NUMBER. ONE TWENTY NINE. MARCO GEORGE IN STRONG SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU LANDLINE NUMBER. ONE NINETY SEVEN. REBECA GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN Q. AS OF RIGHT NOW. AND I BELIEVE TO END THIS. OPPOSITION WE HAVE LARRY MARSH TO START TODAY. FROM CD EIGHT HELLO FONG. POURED OUT MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LARRY MORRIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSESS THE SOCIUS WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHICH WE ARE- OPPOSED AB FIVE EIGHTEEN THE PURPOSE BEHIND THE CURRENT VERSION OF PENAL COD SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR IS TO ENSURE THE PUNISHMENT FITS THE CRIME AND TO ENSURE THAT T OFFENDED RECEIVES NEITHER EXCESSIVE PUNISHMENT NOR INAPPROPRIATE LENIENCY WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS OR INJUSTICES STEMMING FROM THE CURRENT LANGUAGE. IN P. C. SIXTY FOUR THE LANGUAGE THAT AB FIVE EIGHTEEN SEEKS TO EXCLUDE WAS SEVEN AND SB NINE FOURTEEN TO PREVENT A DEFENDANT FROM RECEIVING A WINDFALL THE LEGISLATURE WAS CONCERNED INDEPENDENT WHO COMMITTED A MORE SERIOUS VIOLENT OFFENCE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CONCERT COMMITTING A SECOND LET SERIOUS PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE SAME COURSE OF CONDUCT THAT ESCAPE PROPER PUNISHMENT ON THE MORE SERIOUS OFFENSE. WHEREAS THE DEFENDANT WHO ONLY COMMITTED THE MORE SERIOUS OFFENSE COULD NOT FOR EXAMPLE A DEFENDANT CONVICTED OF KIDNAP FOR THE PURPOSES OF ROBBERY WHICH CARRIES A PUNISHMENT OF LIFE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE AND ALSO CONVICTED OF THE CRIME OF ROBBERY WHICH CARRIES A PUNISHMENT OF TWO THREE OR FIVE YEARS THE ONLY BE SENTENCED FOR THE ROBBERY. THE BILL ANALYSIS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO NOTED THAT QUOTE IT DEFIES COMMON SENSE THE DEFENDANT CONVICTED OF A STRING OF CRIMES COULD AVOID BEING STATENS ON THE MOST SERIOUS CRIME BILL WHICH HERE SHE IS CONVICTED AND QUOTE THAT REASONING IS EQUALLY COGENT TODAY IT IS EVEN MORE APPARENT TO RETAIN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE BECAUSE ELIMINATING IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE THE BALANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC SAFETY REAL DELEGATION REFLECTED IN THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN. IT PROVIDES IN RELEVANT PART QUOTE ANY PERSON CONVICTED OF A NONVIOLENT FELONY OFFENSE AND SEVENTH ST PRESIDENT SHALL BE. ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE CONSIDERATION CONSIDERATION HAVE COMPLETE THE FULL TERM OR- FOR. OFFENSE AND- IN POP ROCK FIFTY. VOTERS TO RELIGIOUS. WHICH OFFENDERS WHO COMMIT BY CRIMES AND THOSE WHO DO NOT. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING WHETHER A PERSON CONVICTED OF BOTH THE VIOLENT. AND NONVIOLENT OFFENSES ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY PAROLE. IF THE COURT DECIDES THE PERSON WHO'S SIMULTANEOUSLY CONVICTED OF BOTH THE VIOLENT AND NON VIOLENT OFFENSE IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE ON PAROLE. WHEN THE NON SERIOUS OFFENSES THE TERM AND CLOSE. THE CHANGING THE LANGUAGE OF PC SIX FIFTY FOR HIS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL COULD RESULT IN A DOUBLE WHEN THE BALL FOUR DEFENDANTS CONVICTED OF BOTH VIOLENT AND NONVIOLENT OFFENSE. STEMMING FROM THE SAME CONDUCT. THIS IS BECAUSE THE COURT IMPOSING A SENTENCE ON THE NON VIOLENT OFFENSE NOT ONLY POTENTIALLY ALLOWS THE OFFENDER WHO COMMITS BOTH OF OUR NONVIOLENT. AND VIOLENT OFFENSE TO BE GIVEN LESS TIME THAN AN OFFENDER WHO ONLY COMMITS A VIOLENT OFFENSE IT ALLOWS FOR THE OFFENDER WHO COMMITS BOTH THE NONVIOLENT AND VIOLENT OFFENSE TO OBTAIN. EARLIER ALL DAY. THEN THE OFFENDER WHO ONLY COMMIT A VIOLENT OFFENSE. MOREOVER EVEN IF THE SUPREME COURT HOLD THE PERSON WHO IS SERVING A SENTENCE ON BOTH VIOLENT AND NONVIOLENT OFFENSE. IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY PAROLE UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN. UNLESS THE COURT CLARIFIES WHETHER A SENTENCE THAT IS IMPOSED BUT STAYED UNDER PC SIX FIFTY FOUR IS QUOTE UNQUOTE SERVING A SENTENCE. AB FIVE EIGHTEEN WILL CREATE ANOTHER NEW LEGAL ISSUE. BECAUSE UNDER PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE FULL TERM FOR THE PRIMARY OFFENSE MEANS THE LONGEST TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IMPOSED BY THE COURT FOR ANY OFFENCE. AND OF THE PATENT FOR THE CRIME WITH THE LONGEST TERM OF IMPRISONMENT. CAN BE IMPOSED BUT STAYED. THE QUESTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES THE FULL TERM FOR THE PRIMARY OFFENSE. WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER AND CREATE NEW. WE WOULD RISK URGE YOU DISPLAY. BE THE- UNTIL THE CAL. SUPREME DECIDE THE K. WITH IN REYES. SO THAT IF NECESSARY THE LANGUAGE MODIFYING SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR CAN BE CRAFTED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF INTERPRETING PROP FIFTY SEVEN. WE HOPE YOU WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE POTENTIAL UNFAIRNESS AND UNNECESSARY LITIGATION. THAT WILL BE CREATED BY REMOVAL OF THE LONG STANDING COMMONSENSE LIMITATION CURRENTLY EXISTING IN SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR. WE ASK FOR THE- BOOK. OKAY YOU HAVE ANYBODY- AT&amp;T TO HAVE ANYBODY ONLINE WANTS TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. OPPOSITION IT WOULD BE ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE CHEERING UP AS OF RIGHT NOW FOR OPPOSITION. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY HAVE THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR I ALWAYS FIND THAT EVEN WITHIN ONE COMMITTEE HEARING HOW WE CANNOT REMAIN CONSISTENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE TRUST USUAL DISCRETION OR NOT- BUT MY ISSUE EARLIER TODAY WITH AB THREE TWENTY NINE WAS ARE TAKING AWAY JUDICIAL DISCRETION FOR JUDGES WHOM WE TRUST WITH INCREDIBLE RESPONSIBILITY TO DECIDE WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED CRIMES. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE WHICH IS PUTTING YOUR FAITH BACK INTO JUDGE WHO IS MATHIS DEFENDANT HEARD THIS CASE GETS TO MAKE THAT DECISION BY ALL MEANS YOU'RE LEAVING WITHIN THE POWER OF THE JUDGE TO GIVE THE MORE THE HARSHER SENTENCE YOU'RE JUST PUTTING IT INTO THE DISCUSSION OF THE JUDGES WHICH AGAIN. WE OFTEN DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. JOIN THE CLUB I APPRECIATE THAT APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S- COMMENTS ALSO APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES- IS A MEMBER OF OUR K. AND- IN FACT JUDGES CAN STILL CHOOSE ALONG SOME PERSON PERSON AND IF THAT IS WHAT THEY DEEM TO BE NECESSARY BASED ON THE CONTEXT OF THE CRIME. AND THE IDEAS THAT WE'RE NOT FORCING THEIR HAND TO DO THAT BUT ACTUALLY HAVING THEM TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE TO THEN MAKE THE BEST DECISION- SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.
