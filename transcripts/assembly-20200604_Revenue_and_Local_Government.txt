JOINING US TODAY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ANALYST'S OFFICE IS A VIDEO A CONFERENCE ROOM IS DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S BRIAN MUELLER WILL BE PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE INITIATIVE. PLEASE THERE ARE CONNECTED TO THE LA OWES VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS GRANULAR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT IN YOUR HEARING TODAY- WE WILL BE PRESENTING AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEASURE AND OUR ESTIMATES OF THE MEASURES OF FISCAL IMPACTS I WANT TO START OFF A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT- BUT OUR OFFICES ROLE IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS- WE HAVE- AS A STATUTORY ROOMS PROCESS THAT WE PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE. IMPARTIAL DESCRIPTION OF THE OF THE MEASURE AND IT'S FISCAL IMPACTS FOR THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE AND UNDER THIS SOMEWHAT NARROW ROLE WE DON'T THINK OF THIS ON THE MERITS OF MEASURES AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES IN THE HEARING TODAY BUT YOU DO HAVE A NUMBER OF PANELISTS WILL FOLLOW. AFTER ME WHO ARE BETTER POSITIONED TO SPEAK TO THOSE ISSUES BEFORE GETTING INTO THE MEASURE I WANTED TO JUST BRIEFLY GIVE A BIT OF A BACKGROUND ON CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM. PROPERTY TAXES ARE THE SO LARGEST GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCE IN AND IT IS EXCLUSIVELY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCE PROVIDING ABOUT SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR CITIES. COUNTY SCHOOLS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THERE'S SEVERAL CLASSES A PROPERTY THAT ARE TAXED ON THE PROPERTY TAX TO A MAIN CATEGORIES ARE REAL PROPERTY WHICH OUR LAND AND BUILDINGS. ANOTHER MAJOR CATEGORY. BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY WHICH IS ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT BUSINESSES ON LIKE EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY AND COMPUTERS AND FURNITURE- THESE TWO CATEGORIES OF PROPERTY OR TAX-DIFFERENTLY UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM- REAL PROPERTY IS TAXED BASED ON THE SYSTEM THAT WAS CREATED BY PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THAT IS ITS- ITS TAXABLE VALUE OR ASSESSED VALUE IS SET BASED ON ITS- PURCHASE PRICE WHEN IT'S PURCHASED. AT THE ASSESSOR SENTENCED ACTUAL VALUE BASED ON WHAT IT WAS BUT I WHAT WAS PAID FOR AND- EACH YEAR THEREAFTER THAT TACKLE VALUES ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION BY UP TO TWO PERCENT. THE NAME OF THE PROPERTY IS SOLD AGAIN IT'S TAX WITHOUT USE RESET TO ITS NEW PURCHASE PRICE. UNDER THIS SYSTEM- MOST PROPERTIES ARE TAX- IT'S SOMETHING BELOW THEIR MARKET VALUE OR WHAT THEY COULD BE PAID FOR THIS IS BECAUSE- THE MARKET VALUE MOST PROPERTIES GROWS. MORE THAN 2% A YEAR. BUSINESS PERSONAL. INCOME IS TACK BASED ON ITS pSOLD FOR TODAY- SO TURNING TO HOW THE INITIATIVE WOULD CHANGE THIS PROJECT SYSTEM IT WOULD MAKE CHANGES BOTH TO. A REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT AND TO BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT. OUR FIRST THE MEASURE WOULD- SHIFT COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL REAL PROPERTY TO MARKET VALUE TAXATION. OF THIS CHANGE WOULD BE PHASED IN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THE CHANGE WOULD NOT START UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOUR- PROPERTIES THAT ARE USED PRIMARILY BY BUSINESSES WITH. FIFTY OR FEWER EMPLOYEES AND THAT MEET CERTAIN OTHER CRITERIA PROPERTIES USED FOR HOUSING AND AGRICULTURAL LAND- WOULD REMAIN OF THE PROP THIRTEEN SYSTEM WOULD BE TAX BASED ON THEIR ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE. US SOME COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES ALSO WOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THE SHIP THE MARKET VALUE TAXATION UNDER THE MEASURE SPECIFICALLY. OF THOSE PROPERTIES THAT ARE OWNED BY A PERSON OR BUSINESS THAT OWNS- IN TOTAL- THREE MILLION OR LESS IN PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA- WOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THE SHIFT TO MARKET VALUE TAXATION. THE MEASURE ALSO PROPOSES CHANGES THE BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY THAT WOULD REDUCE ACTUAL VALUE OF HIS PERSONAL PROPERTY BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR EACH BUSINESS. IF A BUSINESS HAS LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY THAN THEY WOULD PAY NO TAX ON THOSE ITEMS. IN ADDITION ALL PERSONAL TAXES WOULD BE ELIMINATED FOR- BUSINESSES WITH MORE THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES AND THAT MEANS. A CERTAIN OTHER CRITERIA THEN TURNING OUR- OF THE FOR OF THE MEASURE THE LAW. THE FACT IS FROM THE SHIFT OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL REAL PROPERTY TO MARKET VALUE TAXATION. MOST OWNERS OF COMMERCIAL REAL PROPERTY WOULD. FACE HIGHER PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS UNDER THE SHIFT THAT IS BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE PROPERTIES TAX OF VALUES NOW FALL BELOW THEIR MARKET VALUE. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THESE HIGHER TAXES WE PHASED IN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. WE THINK THOUGH BY AROUND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MOST- COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD BE PAYING A HIGHER TAXES. OF BEGINNING AROUND THIS TIME- TOTAL NEW REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SHIFT. WOULD BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT BILLION AND TWELVE I'VE FOUGHT DOLLARS PER YEAR. I WE WOULD KNOW THAT THIS IS A NEW REVENUE STREAM WOULD BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THE EXISTING PROPERTY TAX REVENUE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE MORE CLOSELY TIED. TO FLUCTUATIONS. IT'S AND OF SOMEWHAT OFFSETTING THE INCREASE FROM THE SHIP IN A REAL PROPERTY TO WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN THIS PERSONAL TAXES PAID BY BUSINESSES WE ESTIMATE THAT UNDER THE MEASURES PROVISIONS BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS WOULD BE REDUCED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THE MEASURE ALSO SETS ASIDE FROM THE NEW- REVENUE MONIES TO COVER VARIOUS COSTS RELATED TO THE MEASURE- THIS INCLUDES PROVIDING SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO COUNTING IS. TO COVER THEIR COSTS OF ADMINISTERING THE MEASURE. SO AFTER OFFSETTING- THE BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY REDUCTIONS AND THE COST OF THE MEASURE WE ESTIMATE THAT THE MEASURE WOULD PROVIDE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX POINT FIVE AND ELEVEN POINT FIVE. BILLION IN A NEW PROPERTY TAX REVENUE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SCHOOLS EACH YEAR- THIS FUNDING WOULD BE SPLIT 60% TO CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. ARE WITH EACH PARTICULAR LOCALITY IS- SHARE BEING VARYING BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS AND IT WOULD VERY ACROSS REGIONS OF THE STATE AS WELL. THE REMAINING COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THOSE ALLOCATIONS INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES. WITH LARGELY. I REFLECT THE PEOPLE ALLOCATIONS AND ARE MADE UNDER THE STATE'S EXISTING LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WITHIN THAT INTRODUCTION OF THE MEASURE I'D BE HAPPY TO. QUESTIONS. SEASON ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. YEAH HELLO I USED TO BE ON THE BUNDLE CITY COUNCIL AND I KNOW THAT OUR CITY IS A- KNOWN LOW PROPERTY TAX CITY SO WE GET VERY LITTLE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT TO ALL GOVERNMENTS OF SCHOOLS RECEIVE AN EQUAL SHAREOF THE NEW TAX REVENUE FROM THIS MEASURE. WELL THE MAJORITY OF THE NEW TAX REVENUE CODE OF. MORE WEALTHY JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE HIGH VALUE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED. YES THERE'S- KIND OF THEIRS AND AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT THE ALLOCATION TWO KEY FACTORS ARE. WHAT IS EACH LOCALITIES CURRENT SHARE OF THE PROPERTY TAX. AND HOW MUCH NEW REVENUE WILL BE GENERATED- BY THE SHIFT TO MARKET VALUE TAXATION FOR PROPERTIES WITHIN THAT JURISDICTION. SO IN GENERAL RIGHT NOW IF THEY- JURISDICTION IS RECEIVING A HIGHER SHARE OF THE PROPERTY TAX- THEY'RE LIKELY TO SEE MORE OF A HIGHER SHARE THIS MEASURE. AND ALSO IF THE JURISDICTION HAS A NUMBER OF- OF HIGH VALUE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES- THAT. WOULD RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT- UPWARD A REVISION IN THEIR TAX ASSESSMENT THEN THAT JURISDICTION ALSO WOULD RECEIVE- A LARGER SHARE. ANYONE ELSE HAVE A QUESTION THE SUMMER KILEY. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S US HEIGHT ON SUMMARY FOR THIS INITIATIVE AND- WHETHER YOU THINK IT. CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF- WHAT FOLKS ARE BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON IN IN A NEUTRAL BALANCED WAY. I DON'T I DON'T THINK I CAN PROVIDE ANY COMMENT ON THAT I THINK THAT'S KIND OF OUTSIDE OF. THE CHARGES BEEN GIVEN TO OUR OFFICE ON THIS INITIATIVE. THE LA I WILL BE DOING ITS OWN SUMMARY RIGHT. WELL WE PROVIDE A SUMMARY ANALYSIS THAT SHOWS UP IN THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE YES. OKAY DO YOU IDENTIFIED ANY DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED IN THE- TITLE SUMMARY AND HOW YOUR OFFICE WILL IS PRIVATE. HI I DON'T THINK I CAN SPEAK TO THAT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. SERENA RELIVING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND- THIS IS THIS MAY AS WELL BE OUT OF THE PURVIEW OF WHAT THE LA IS OFFICE WAS LOOKING OUT MISTER YOU ARE SO. I APOLOGIZE THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALMDALE DID RAISE AN ISSUE ABOUT PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATIONS AND INEQUITIES THAT DIFFERENT- CITIES HAVE. BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW ALLOCATION- THAT MAYBE WAS FROZEN IN TIME BY EIGHTY EIGHT IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES BUT WE'RE CITIES THAT ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER ARE RETAINING. FAR DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM- PROPERTY TAX DOLLARS- THAT ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER DELIVERING SIMILAR SERVICES. AND WHETHER IN ANY OF THE THEIR REVIEW OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE I ARE THERE WAYS TO MODERNIZE WHAT AB EIGHT DID TO CREATE GREATER EQUITY BETWEEN COMMUNITIES THANKS. I THINK THAT THE ALLEGATIONS PROVIDED TO AMONG CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THEN A KIND OF A HOTLY DEBATED TOPIC FOR REALLY DECADES FRONT PRETTY MUCH EVERY SENSE PROP THIRTEEN WAS PUT IN PLACE- AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF KIND OF CHALLENGES TO REFORMING THAT IN TERMS OF- IN SOME SENSE IT'S A- IT'S A ZERO SUM GAME THAT YOU KNOW REVENUE SHIFTED FROM TWO ONE YOUR STATION HAS TO COME FROM SOME OTHER PLACE AND THAT'S MADE IT- KIND OF A DIFFICULT AREA OF REFORM- WE DID NOT. IN IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE ANALYSIS FOR THIS MEASURE WE DID NOT CONSIDER- AS I MENTIONED KIND OF THE POLICY MERITS OF THE MEASURES DECISION TO- ALLOCATE THE NEW REVENUE CONSISTENT WITH THE EXISTING. PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATION SYSTEM. SOMEONE WILL TELL. YES HAS THE- LA- FACTORED IN TO THE OVERALL FINANCIAL FORMULA HERE THE DEVASTATING IMPACT THAT RAISING TAXES ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE WILL HAVE ESPECIALLY WITH COVE ID NINETEEN IMPACTS ON THE WHOLE ECONOMY AND MANY MANY COMPANIES WILL BE DOING REMOTE WORK INSTEAD OF ANY OFFICES FOR SOCIAL SPACE IN A TETRA AND ALSO HAVE YOU FACTORED IN. THE EXODUS OF. OUT OF CALIFORNIA OF MANY OF COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES AND BECAUSE THIS IS PHASED IN. IF I OWNED LARGE AMOUNTS OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTY WHICH I DON'T. I WOULD BE GETTING NOT A DODGER REAL FAST BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HAVE YOU FACTORED ANY OF THAT IS. THANK YOU. IT YES THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER WE DID IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING OUR ANALYSIS WE DID REVIEW THE AVAILABLE RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE ON THE POTENTIAL FAX- OF. A MEASURE LIKE THIS ON- BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA- WE DID REVIEW THAT IN INCORPORATE THAT AS BEST WE COULD IN OUR ANALYSIS- ON YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF CODED- I THINK THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE INHERENT IN- THE POTENTIAL REVENUE THE COULD BE RAISING THIS MEASURE I THINK YOU POINTED OUT ONE SIGNIFICANT ONE. AND WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INCORPORATE- THAT UNCERTAINTY IN THE FACT THAT WE PRESENTED QUITE A WIDE RANGE OF POTENTIAL REVENUE UP WITH. WITH ESTIMATE AND THAT IS JUST DEGREE ATTEMPTING TO. BOTH THE FOR FLUCTUATIONS THE MIKE FROM NOW ECONOMICS I IS AS A KIND OF AN X. THINGS LIKE BUT. THANK YOU A ASSEMBLY MAY. CHIU FROM. I THANK YOU MISTER OF MADONNA ARE THE ARE YOU PEARL TO I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO DO THE IMP OF COBRA NINETEEN HAS BEEN OVER. AND WHILE DELAY TAKE TO WHAT WE ARE IS TO REDUCE CUT TO PROGRAM IN OUR BUDGET THE REVENUE OF THIS IN THE WELL HOW TO COME. THROUGH VERY DIFFICULT TIME AND VERY THE. OUR REQUEST FOR THE IS OF I FOR DIZZY IS CA OF LOW THE IF THE FIELD FOR COME THAT BEING A ROCK AROUND FULL TIME VERSUS THE NEW COMP WOULD JUST OF PURCHASE CARE LESS. IN THE ROOT. SO WHAT. THE IMPLEMENTERS. AT THE- IS TO STEP THE BY THE VOTER. WHO WOULD THE LOWER. OF THE- PROPERTY TAX. PULLED SMALL BIZ IF THE NEWER BEST. WHO PEOPLE MUCH CAN ALSO. THE INCREASE AND TAX. FOR THE REDUCTION IN NEW YORK A- I DON'T KNOW THAT I GET SPEAK TO IN BUSINESS ARE THAT OVER. THE IN THE BUSINESS PERSONAL BECAUSE WHAT ALL. PARTIALLY THE INK TAX THAT WOULD BE PAID ON REAL THERE BE SOME BUSINESS AS YOU MAY THAT MAYBE JUST PURCHASE REAL PROPERTY THAT HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY THEY- BUSINESSES AND THAT ROOM STANDS MAY NOT FACE OPENING A TAXING. FOR HAVE SOME TAX A UNDER THE MEASURE I YOU KNOW I CAN'T SPEAKS TO YOUR BUSINESSES ARE FROM SAN LOW. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER YOU IF YOU'RE PRESSED I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. HOW WILL THIS INITIATIVE IMPACT AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY INCLUDING ANY TANGIBLE PROPERTY NOT CLASSIFIED AS LAND SUCH AS AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT. YEAH SO THE MEASURE- VERY CLEARLY- EXEMPTS AGRICULTURAL LAND FROM THE SHIP TO MARKET VALUE TAXATION- AS FOR OTHER KINDS OF PROPERTY THAT MIGHT BE RELATED TO AGRICULTURE- IF THOSE PROPERTIES HAVE A- COMMERCIAL USE- THAN THIS MEASURE LIKELY WOULD SHIFT THOSE PROPERTIES TO A MARKET VALUE TAXATION. AND THEN SO JUST TO BE CLEAR ALSO IS IF THIS INITIATIVE PASSES THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT GOES TO SCHOOLS ADD TO EXISTING LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL FUNDING OR WOULD IT REPLACE EXISTING FUNDING. BASICALLY HOW'S IT GOING TO AFFECT PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEES. YES THANK YOU I THINK I COULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR ABOUT THAT IN MY COMMENTS THIS- THE FUNDING THAT WOULD GO TO SCHOOLS. I WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTARY TO WHATEVER FUNDING SCHOOLS RECEIVE UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THOSE OF THE END OF MY QUESTIONS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE.

EIGHT AFTER SHE ACT WHICH AND DIDN'T GIVE WITH TIME AND TALENTS. HIM GAUGE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE REVENUE AND TAXATION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC I'M A CO FOUNDER THE BLUE SKY CONSULTING GROUP PRIOR TO THAT. THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE FOR THE STATE FROM NINETEEN NINETY NINE THROUGH TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. I BEGAN MY CAREER WITH THE STATE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WERE AT THE PROPERTY TAX AND LOCAL FISCAL RELIEF ASSIGNMENT. OVER MY NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO THE STATE I ALSO SERVED AS CHIEF CONSULTANT TO THE ASSEMBLY WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AND WHAT THE- THIS CALL BECAUSE- TO TWO PRESIDENTS PRO TEM. OF THE STATE SENATE AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS WITH YOU ABOUT WHY SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES FIRST IS SO CRITICAL. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT BUSINESS PROPERTIES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 45% OF ALL PROPERTY TAXES IN CALIFORNIA COMPARED 255% PAID BY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. TODAY BUSINESS PROPERTIES ACCOUNT FOR JUST 28% OF CALIFORNIA PROPERTY TAXES. COMPARED 272% PAID BY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. CHANGE PROP THIRTEEN PROPERTY TAXES AS A PERCENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE FELL FROM 55228% AND AT THE SAME TIME FEES CHARGES AND OTHER TAXES HAVE INCREASED FROM REVENUES AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND PROPERTY TAXES PAID BY LARGE CORPORATE PROPERTIES LANGUAGE. CAUSING THE REST OF US IN EFFECT TO BE NICKEL AND DIME. THE BILL HAS SHARE. OF STATE AND LOCAL TAXES IN CALIFORNIA IS BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AS IS THE RATIO OF BUSINESS TAXES TO BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM STATE AND LOCAL SPENDING. IN SHORT ON AVERAGE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ARE PAYING LESS AND GETTING MOE AND RETURN COMPARED TO. BUSINESSES IN OTHER STATES. DESPITE ROBUST ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A SURGEON ON PROPERTY TAX REVENUE PER CAPITA CITY AND COUNTY REVENUE AND CALIFORNIA FELL FROM. SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO SIX HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS TODAY I NEARLY 20% DECLINE. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN CALIFORNIA WAS SEVENTH IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. TODAY IT IS THIRTY SEVEN. EVEN AS HOMEOWNERS AND EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS SHOULD SHOULDER GREATER BURDEN TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SUBSIDIES TO LARGE BUSINESS PROPERTY OWNERS. VITAL PUBLIC INVESTMENTS HAVE SUFFERED. IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON INFRASTRUCTURE WAS THIRTY SEVEN AMONG ALL STATE. SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES FIRST EXPAND INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING CAPACITY FOR SCHOOLS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. LIKE SPENDING THE TAX BASE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES FIRST WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PAY OFF LOCAL BOND MEASURES PAID BY VOTER APPROVED PROPERTY TAX RATE OVERRIDES MORE QUICKLY AND MAKE FUTURE INVESTMENTS LESS COSTLY FOR HOMEOWNERS SCHOOLS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS OPENS THE DOOR TO A BAND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BY SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SCHOOLS IN THESE FIRST IS DELIBERATELY DESIGNED TO BOOST CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS. THE MEASURE ALUMINIZED BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES ON EQUIPMENT AND FIXTURES LIKE MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT COMPUTERS AND SERVERS ON THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF PROPERTY FOR ALL BUSINESSES AND COMPLETELY ELIMINATED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS TAX CUT MEANS THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES. WILL EITHER PAY NO INCREASE A RECEIVE A TAX REDUCTION AS A RESULT OF THE MEASURE. HOME BASED BUSINESSES WHICH MAKE UP ABOUT 50% OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ARE SPECIFICALLY EXEMPT FROM THE ASSESSMENT BY THE MEASURE LIKE EVERY OTHER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY AND WOULD RECEIVE A TAX CUT FOR THE PROPERTY TAX THEY PAY ON THEIR BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY. TAXPAYERS WHO PROPERTIES ARE VALUED AT LESS THAN THREE MILLION DOLLARS- EXPLICITLY EXEMPT AND ENJOY THE SAME BENEFITS. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT RENT ALSO RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX CUT AND ARE PROTECTED FROM REASSESSMENT BAY- PATH THROUGH BY THE FAITH IN PROVISIONS OF THE MEASURE. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEASURE DELAYED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE. AND CRAFT A FAITH IN PLAN AND THEN A MINIMUM OF THREE ADDITIONAL YEARS BEFORE FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND MORE IF THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINES THAT THE PURPOSE. BECAUSE OF THIS SMALL BUSINESS RENTERS HAVE YEARS TO ADJUST BEFORE LANDLORDS. EXPERIENCE REASSESSMENT. THE RESULT OF IT IS A MEASURE THAT REWARD SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND PLACES A LITTLE IF ANY ADDITIONAL TAX BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESSES. EXACTLY THE KIND OF APPROACH WE NEED COMING OUT OF THIS CURRENT CRISIS. I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS TWO STATEMENTS BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THE FIRST OF THESE WAS THEIR STATEMENT THAT- MOST PROPERTIES WILL SEE A TAX INCREASE BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT FROM ONLY 10% OF THE MOST UNDER SAYS COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES IN THE STATE. IN ADDITION- THERE WAS A QUESTION OF THE ANALYSTS ABOUT AGRICULTURE AND THE TREATMENT OF AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY WOULD LARGELY REMAIN AS UNDER CURRENT LAW. LAND CROPS BARNES AND SO FORTH. WOULD REMAIN. AS TREATED UNDER CURRENT LAW AND WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS MEASURE. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I'D LIKE TO TURN THE PRESENTATION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SASHA CUTLER. I WOULD NOW ASK THE MODERATOR TO CONNECT US WITH SASHA CUTLER WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. WE HAVE TO LINE OPEN FOR SASHA CUTLER YOU MAY PROCEED. YES I AM I DOCTOR CUTLER AND- I'M NOT I APPRECIATE- THE FAMILY MEMBERS THE WILL ALLOWING ME TED AT THE FIVE BY BY TELEPHONE ALTHOUGH THAT PUTS ME AT A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE- NURSES SUCH AS MYSELF ARE. ODD NOT ONLY- THE MOST TRUSTED PROTECTION WERE ALSO THE BETTER LOOKING SO YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO. TAKE A LOOK AT ME- I'VE I'VE I HAVE A PHD IN NURSING THAT I OBTAINED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO- IN AND THAT WAS ABOUT- TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT THAT WOULD BE DONE BY THE IN A PUBLIC HEALTH. WHERE I WORKED- FOR MANY YEARS AS WELL I BEGAN WORKING IN. THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN THE ADULT DAVID- IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SO CURRENT EVENTS REALLY TO ME NOW WITH. THERE THE BEES WITHOUT BACK. NOW WITH BAND THERE'S NO FRAME THE GREED THE LAW AFTER LOG THAT WE HAVE GOING ON. AND NOW HAVE BEEN PEOPLE ARE WONDER WHETHER THEIR PATIENT ARE STILL TO BE THERE WHEN THEY COME BACK AGAIN- I HAVE BEEN I HAVE BEEN WORKING DURING THIS PANDEMIC- BOTH- FRONTLINE- PROVIDING- CASTING. THAT PATIENTS IN THEIR HOMES ORIGINALLY- WHEN THAT ONE OUT IT BEGAN IN SAN FRANCISCO AND NOW I'M WORKING ON THE NURSE ADVICE LINE AT THE HOSPITAL I'M AFRAID OF GETTING THE DISEASE AND I'M AFRAID OF GIVING IT TO MY FAMILY- AND- WHAT MY PATIENT. YEAH MY COWORKERS CURRENTLY MY COULD DURATION IS- IN THE IN THE CALL CENTER AND IN THE CALL CENTER- THERE WAS ONE OF OCT UNFORTUNATELY BECAME INFECTED AND JOINED THE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHO ARE NOW HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH KOBE NINETEEN AND THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THAT NUMBER WE CAN'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM BECAUSE OF A LACK OF. A PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT BUT THAT COULD BE VERY MANY OF THEM BUT BECAUSE OF THE CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING AND- STAFFING- I WITHOUT WORK IN OUR FACILITY I AM NOW WORKING IN A ROW- YEAH I'M UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT IT BETWEEN- WE MIGHT HELP AND THEIR CO WORKERS WE'RE SITTING IN. THE VENTILATION A ALL. OPEN THE WINDOWS AND THAT ARE NOT HERE GO THROUGH THEIR ON THEIR NO THERE'S NO CANNOT AVAIL. AND THERE HAVE BEEN- WE HAVE BEEN WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO RATION THE EQUIPMENT AND WE'RE ASKING FOR DONATIONS. FROM THE PUBLIC FOR PERSONALIZED PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THIS IS AN A COLOSSAL FAILURE OF THE PUBLIC HELD UP CALIFORNIA THAT I'M VERY PROUD TO WORK WITH. WE NEED HELP WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT. FOR THIS- WE HAVE- WE NOW HAVE WE NOW HAVE THIS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY FIRST WHICH IS HOW I KNOW THIS. IS MEASURE ON BECAUSE I'M NOT A I'M NOT A TAX EXPERT ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT AND WE COULD REALLY USE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS- SHOULD BE HELPING THAT SCHOOLS AND- AND HEALTHCARE IS WELL. THE COMMISSION SHALL ROLLED DOWN THERE WE HAVE- THAT WE HAVE TO FOR SALE- AND IT'S REALLY UNCONSCIONABLE THERE WE LITERALLY PUTTING OUR ON THE LINE. I WOULD CORPORATION THE STATE ARE BENEFITING FROM TACK LOOP. OTHER DRAINING REAP FROM LOCAL. AND SCHOOL. I'VE NEVER CARED FOR A CORPORATION BEFORE I CARED FOR HUMAN BEING. WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU TO WIN BACK THEN POPPED NOT CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. AND CO CHAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS FOR SHOULD THE I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS- MANY SMALL BUSINESSES LEASE THE PROPERTY WHERE THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS. COULD CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES STILL BE AFFECTED IF THE PROPERTY WHERE THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS DOES NOT FALL WITHIN THE SMALL BUSINESS DOES BUSINESS EXEMPTION. THIS IS TEN GAUGE I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION- SO THE AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY THE VAST MAJORITY OF. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA OUR OTHER HOME BASED FOR ALL THE RIGHT PROPERTY A RELATIVELY SMALLER PROPORTION RENT THEIR PROPERTY. AND PART OF THE DESIGN OF THE MEASURE WAS TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THOSE. RENTERS BUSINESS RENTERS TO NEGOTIATE- RENEGOTIATE THEIR LEASES BEFORE THE PROPERTY IS REASSESS SO- THE LEGISLATURE AS I MENTIONED MY COMMENT BASICALLY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO EXTEND A PHASE IN PERIOD- UNDER THE MEASURE IT'S A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS- BUT THEY CAN EXPAND THAT FURTHER. THE INTENTION OTHER THE MEASURE WOULD BE- TO FOCUS ON PROPERTIES WERE THE GREATEST DISPARITY IN TERMS OF- THE GAP BETWEEN ASSESSED VALUE IN MARKET VALUE AND SO. MANY OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD WRAP WOULD HAVE AS A STAY A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR LEASES. CURRENTLY THE LEASES THAT THEY PAY YOU ARE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY- BUSINESS HAS A VERY OLD- PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT I DON'T BASE YOUR VALUE UNDER PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. AND AS CONSEQUENCES LOW PROPERTY TAXES. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THEY'RE NOT PASSING THOSE SAVINGS THROUGH TO THEIR RENTERS BECAUSE- RENTS ARE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET. AND SO WHEN THAT KIND OF ORDER- IS RE ASSESSED BUSINESSES THAT RAN FROM THAT ORDER WILL BE IN A POSITION TO SHOP AROUND IN THE MARKET- BECAUSE THE MARKET IN EFFECT IS WHAT HAS WHAT HAS DETERMINED- ACOSTA THE RENT NOT THAT- PROPERTY TAX RATE THAT THE OWNER IS PAYING. OKAY THANK YOU MY LAST QUESTION IF IT OVER. THIS IS CAROLYN GRAY IF I MAY I'D JUST LIKE TO ADD ON I'M IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION THREE- I THINK THAT THIS QUESTION LEAD TO AND HOW IT WAS JUST ANSWERED- THAT NEEDS TO. BE UNDER SCORED IT BECAUSE- BILLS THAT LANDLORDS THAT HAVE PROPERTIES FOR THEIR PAIN LOWER TAX AND THEY ARE NOT RULING INVESTING IN THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE DECADE THE DEGREE THAT MAN IN THE UNITY AND ESPECIALLY THOSE. IN BLACK AND OTHER. COLOR AND SO IT WILL LAST CRITICAL SERVICE GAS SUCH AS EMERGENCY BUT BY PUBLIC HEALTH OR- SCHOOL ON THE THEIR OWN AND FUNDING DOING MY PART TO THE BROKEN PROPERTY TAX. AND SO I THINK- BACK NEEDS TO BE UNDERSCORED HERE. THANK YOU AND I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION WHICH I NORMALLY GET ASKED BY MANY OF MY LOCAL AGENCIES BUT ARE THERE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON HOW LOCAL AGENCIES CAN USE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. GAGE AGAIN- NO THE ANSWER IS THESE ARE- GENERAL PURPOSE REVENUES- TO BE USED FOR ANY LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE. SO LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF ALL STRIPES HAVE DISCRETION AS TO HOW THOSE MONIES ARE SPENT GREAT. ANSWER THAT ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER KILEY. THANK YOU ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HEAR FROM FOLKS ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE IS THAT IF IT PASSES THEN THE PROTECTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS WILL BECOME A MORE VULNERABLE AND SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE EACH OF THE PROPONENTS- AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN ASSURANCE THAT YOUR- ULTIMATELY AND- MAINTAINING THE PROTECTIONS. FOR RESIDENCES AND YOU DON'T YOU THIS INITIATIVE AS ONE STEP. DOWN THAT ROAD. THIS IS CAROLYN GRAY AND I'M HAPPY TO RESPONSE DAD BECAUSE THAT IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO HOT- SINCE MOST SMALL BUSINESSES- ARE OPERATING FROM THEIR HOME. AND THE ABSOLUTELY NOT RESIDENTS IN OUR PROTECT AND BY THE MEASURE EXPLICITLY. THIS IS TIM GAUGE I CAN ECHO THAT AS WELL- THAT PROPONENTS MEASURE HAD NO INTENTION OF ATTEMPTING AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE AS HAS BEEN ASSERTED BY THE OPPONENTS TRYING TO EXTEND THIS IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM TO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY THIS IS CLEARLY EXCLUDED- IN THE MEASURE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO. THIS IS TOXIC CUTLER HI MY I'M A NURSE AND I AM- I'M OFF A HOMEOWNER SO I AM SOMEBODY WHO BENEFIT FROM THE- THAT CAP ON ON IN CREEPING UP PROPERTY TAX SO- THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND I FIND IT VERY DISINGENUOUS THAT WHEN PEOPLE TO GET THAT THIS IS RAISING TAX BERMAN. FOR CALIFORNIANS- THE EQUIVALENT OF SAYING THAT- THAT THIS IS THE GRAND THAT MAKE IT THEN BAD ON THE ECONOMY UP THE UP. THE BILLIONAIRES WHO HAVE- MADE SO MUCH MONEY THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY BENEFITED FROM THAT. PANDEMIC. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. THANK YOU JUST REAL QUICKLY I USED TO SERVE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD SO EDUCATION FUNDING IS A MAJOR PRIORITY AND IF I'M READING THE LA- ANALYSTS CORRECTLY IT SAYS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND FAMOUS TO THE STATE COME THE FIRST THANK ON PAYMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEN LAST OUR SCHOOLS AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHY SCHOOLS ARE THE LOWEST FUNDING PRIORITY IN THIS MEASURE. I THINK IT'S A CLEAR MISREADING A MEASURE TO THINK THAT SCHOOLS ARE THE LOWEST PRIORITY- THEY'RE NOT- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING TO SCHOOLS IS SIMPLY A- BASED ON THE CURRENT SHARES OF LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES SO THAT SCHOOLS CURRENTLY RECEIVING 40% OF. LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES NAY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THING AND I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO MY CULTURE. THANK YOU AND NOW WE'RE ON TO THE OPPONENTS AND I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME UP AND I WILL GIVE NAMES AND WE'LL INTRODUCE YOU THROUGH THE MODERATOR. MR JULIAN AT- AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE DR JON CALL MR DONE A JOHN COULD FALL FROM PRESENT HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND MR LERI STONE THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY ASSESSOR. I CALIFORNIA'S SISTERS ASSOCIATION YOU HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES TO SPLIT BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU- PLEASE NOW CONNECT US TO THE CAPITAL WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM ROOM ONE TWENTY FIVE AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE. MR JULIAN CAN FIRST. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. I'M NOT A JAZZ BURKE I DON'T CARE- CURRY IN MEMBERS DRINKING AT A PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA SENATE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT THIS JOINT HEARING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF STATIC ON BUSINESSES AND ALSO SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC CRISIS. UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE GROWING BY THE DAY. AND MAY REACH LEVELS WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. TODAY HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT BUSINESS AND BIG BUSINESS AND OFTENTIMES IT SEEMS LIKE OUR PROPONENTS TESTIMONY MAKES IT SEEM LIKE THAT ANYONE WHO OWNS A BUSINESS IS A MILLION OR BILLION THERE. THAT COULD NOT BE ANY FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH EVEN THOUGH THE BEST OF TIMES. I'M HERE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE FOUR MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND A SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES WHO ARE HANGING ON BY A THREAD. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO RE OPEN THEIR DOORS AND STAY IN BUSINESS. AND YET HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RAISING PROPERTY TAXES ON BUSINESSES BY AS MUCH AS TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. 48% OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE OUR IN OUR POINT MY SMALL BUSINESS. AGAIN 48% OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE EMPLOYED BY SMALL BUSINESS SEVEN POINT ONE WORKERS IN ALL AND LET'S BE CLEAR PROPONENTS MAY BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE TRAIN THEIR SIGHTS ON THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BUT THE TAB CALLED ONLY BE PAID BY BOTH SMALL BUSINESSES AND ALL OF US CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS. YOU AND I WILL PAY MORE FOR EVERYTHING WE BUY AND USE FROM RESTAURANTS IN HERE CUTS A GALLON OF MILK AND EIGHT TO CLOSE DAY CARE HEALTH CARE FUEL AND TELL THE COST. SO THE PANDEMIC PANDEMIC AGAIN. THIS BODY HAS DEBATED MANY MEASURES TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING RESTAURANTS RETAIL SHOP OWNERS THROUGHOUT THIS GREAT STATE. YET THE MEASURE WOULD HARM THIS MEASURE WOULD HARM MANY OF THE SAME BUSINESS AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE MOST VULNERABLE. NUMEROUS STUDIES INCLUDING THOSE BY THE END DOUBLE ACP OF CALIFORNIA PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY AND THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS UP TAXPAYER FOUNDATION ALSO I THAT WOULD PROPERTY TAXES INCREASED ON BUSINESS PROPERTIES SMALL BUSINESSES PAY MORE. MOST SMALL BUSINESSES RENT THE PROPERTY WHERE THEY OPERATE THE PLACE OF BUSINESS AND MOST OF THE RELEASES INCLUDE. WHAT IS CALLED A TRIPLE NET LEASE THAT MEANS BUSINESS RENTALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPERTY TAXES INSURANCE AND MAINTENANCE COSTS BY THE WAY ACCORDING THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT. OF ALL SPACE BUSINESSES NOT ON THE PROPERTY THEY RANKED. SO THAT MEANS THE MEASURES HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES WILL TRANSLATE TO INCREASE RENTS FOR THE MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES AT A TIME WHEN THE VERY SMALL. THE VERY SAME SMALL BUSINESSES ARE JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN AND THEIR WORKERS EMPLOYED WHEN PROPERTY TAXES AND LET THE PRIEST SMALL BUSINESSES ARE LEFT WITH FEW CHOICES. THEY CAN SHUT THE DOORS ALREADY A REALITY IN SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING WOULD BE LOS. LAY OFF EMPLOYEES THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL FACE IS HOW TO RE HIRE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE LAID OFF IN PANDEMIC. OR MOVE OUT OF STATE. THAT THIS IS NOT LIKELY OPTION. HOW CALIFORNIA. PRESENT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WITH IS A POSSIBLE CHOICE. NOTHING IN THE SPLIT WILL MEASURE EXEMPTS SMALL BUSINESSES FROM REASSESSMENT. THE SPLIT WILL MEASURES REASSESSMENT PROVISION DOES NOT EVEN MENTION THE WORD SMALL BUSINESS AT ALL. INSTEAD IT HINGES REASSESSMENT ON THE VALUE IN OWNERSHIP OF A PROPERTY. THAT MEANS THE MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES WON'T QUALIFY FOR THE FULL PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION OR THE TEMPORARY RELIEF. FROM REASSESSMENT THAT REPORT. LET ME TAKE. MASSIVE TAX INCREASE WILL HURT SMALL BUSINESSES ALREADY STRUGGLING TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN. IF WORK IF YOU'RE ALL SERIOUS. ABOUT RETURNING CALIFORNIA TO ECONOMIC CAL START WITH CALIFORNIA'S ONE FOUR MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES. A SMALL BUSINESSES FOR SUPPORTING THE LARGEST PROPERTY TAX INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY IS THE LAST THING THAT OUR STATE NEEDS TO GET SMALL BUSINESSES BACK ON THEIR FEET AND SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION SMALL BUSINESS WORKERS BACK TO THEIR JOBS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NOW WE'LL HAVE OUR NEXT PRESENTER AND THAT WILL BE OF A. JOHN COOPER BREAUX PRESENT HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU CO CHAIRS BURKE AND I'VE WORKED CURRY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M JUNK FALL PRESIDENT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST TAXPAYER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS INITIATIVE FIRST. TAXPAYERS ARE ALSO CONSUMERS TAXES ON BUSINESSES HAVE AN INSIDIOUS WAY OF TRICKLING DOWN TO CONSUMERS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER COSTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES CALIFORNIA'S COST OF LIVING IS ALREADY WAY ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND WE DON'T NEED TO ADD TO THAT BURDEN FOR MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTS. MUCH OF THE COST OF LIVING CALIFORNIA'S DRIVEN BY HIGH TAXES BUT EVEN RESOLVE THE HEALTH ISSUES CURRENTLY RELATED TO THE COAL BUT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HIGHER TAXES ARE THE LAST THING WE NEED RIGHT NOW. THE STATE ALREADY HAS THE HIGHEST INCOME TAX RATE AMERICA THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST STATE SALES TAX RATE IN AMERICA WE HAVE THE HIGHEST GAS TAX IN AMERICA WE HAVE THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX WHICH THE MISSISSIPPI AND COMPETING AGAINST OTHER STATES. WHICH WITH- AND WE NOW WE CAN'T REALLY COMPETE AGAINST THEM IN TERMS OF BUSINESS CLIMATE. AND WHEN THE COST OF LIVING IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN THE NATION. MORE IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIA IS NOT EVEN A LOW PROPERTY TAX STATE. CALIFORNIA RANKS SEVENTEEN OTHER FIFTY IN PER CAPITA PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS SO THIS MYTH THAT SOMEHOW PROPOSITION THIRTEEN IT'S GOT A PROPERTY TAXES IN CALIFORNIA IS SIMPLY NOT BORNE OUT BY THE EVIDENCE. TAXPAYERS ARE ALSO WORD BECAUSE THE PROPONENTS HAVE OPENLY ADMITTED THAT RAISING TAXES ON BUSINESSES IS JUST THE FIRST STEP IN THE COMPLETE DISMANTLING OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN OUT. WHAT PROVIDE BOATS ONE BECAUSE I KNOW JUST GOT SOME PUSH FROM THE PROPONENTS ON THAT POINT. HOMEOWNERS ARE WELL JUSTIFIED IN FEARING THAT THE LOSS OF PROP THIRTEEN FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WILL BE FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY PROPOSALS TO REMOVE PROTECTIONS FOR INCOME PRODUCING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES THAT DEPARTMENTS AND THEN AFTER THAT. OF OWNER OCCUPIED SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SOME COUNTY IS A RURAL AREAS WHERE MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS RESIDE WILL ACTUALLY SEEN A LOSS IN REVENUE. AND I WILL LEAVE IT TO THE ASSESSOR OF SANTA CLARA LAURIE STONE WHO'S HERE IN THE ROOM TO ADDRESS THAT THE MYRIAD. OF IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INITIATIVE. LET ME SPEND A MOMENT TO ADDRESS HOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD EXACERBATE. WELL WELL WHAT DO YOU. IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST FISCAL CHALLENGES I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DISPUTES THAT WE ARE SO OVERLY RELIANT ON A HANDFUL OF WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS THAT AND BOOM TIMES REVENUE JUST COMES FLOWING IN THE DOOR BUT IN RECESSIONARY TIMES THE DROP. IS PARTICULARLY SEVERE INDEED REVENUE VOLATILITY IS SUCH A LARGE PROBLEM THE GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER CREATED THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ECONOMY ALSO KNOWS THE PARTS THE COMMISSION TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS REGRETTABLY THERE WAS BROAD CONSENSUS THAT REVENUE VOLATILITY IS IN FACT ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE COMMISSIONERS COULD NOT COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. BUT DURING THE COMMISSION'S HEARING PROCESS LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S PRODUCE A CHART SHOWING THE VOLATILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S REV TAX REVENUES THE CHART DEPICTED A GREAT DEAL OF VOLATILITY IN INCOME TAXES. NOT SO MUCH VOLATILITY IN SALES TAXES BUT STILL PRONOUNCED AN EXTRAORDINARY STABILITY IN THE PROPERTY TAX FREE. INDEED IN INCOME TAXES SALES TAXES. AND THE CLIENTS IN THE MARKET VALUE OF PROPERTY BUT INCREASES IN PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS WHY. ALL THE EQUITY WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE COULD NOT BE TAX BECAUSE THE 2% LIMITATION. PROVIDED A HUGE CUSHION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INDEED EVEN ONE MARKET VALUES OF PROPERTY WERE DECLINING RAPIDLY MANY COUNTIES CONTINUE TO SEE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES IN REVENUE. THIS INITIATIVE MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. WILL TAKE CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEM REVENUE VOLATILITY. REVENUE VOLATILITY CAN MAKE IT MUCH MUCH WORSE. A MOMENT- DISPEL IN TWO MINUTES THIS MEMORY ONLY HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR ALL SPEAKERS THANK YOU RIGHT. OF FIRST IS THE OFTEN HEARD WITH FALSE ARGUMENT TO PROP THIRTEEN COST REDUCTION OF PER PUPIL SPENDING IN EDUCATION. THE REALITY IS THE CALIFORNIA DAY OF SPENDING 30% MORE ON A PER STUDENT PLACE TO ADJUSTED BASIS THEN WE WORDS PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN A TIME WHEN THERE WAS. THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION WAS TOP NOTCH- A SECOND MYTH IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S THAT PROP THIRTEEN SOMEHOW. THIS IS THERE'S NOT TRUE TELEPHONE HAS A HAD A UNIT ROLE OF. UNIFIED TO ROLL SO THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES PROP THIRTEEN AND NOT CHANGE THAT. AND THE OTHER ARGUMENT WE HEAR IS THAT VOTERS WERE NOT BORN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE BUSINESS PROPERTIES WERE PROTECTED THAT'S PATENTLY FALSE THAT ARGUMENT WAS IN THE BALLOT ARGUMENT. NO FINALLY THAT THE PP I SEE POLL THAT JUST CAME OUT SHOW THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE A DEAD SET AGAINST NEW TAXES BY TWO TO ONE MARGIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE HAVE MR LERI STONE I KNOW WE'RE ON LIMITED TIME HERE BUT- IF YOU PLEASE LIKE TO START. YES A GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LARRY STONE THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY ASSESSOR I SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING ALL FIFTY EIGHT ASSESSORS. ASSESSORS BY CONSTITUTION ARE INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED AND HAVE A RANGE OF POLITICAL OPINIONS AS DIVERSE AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT UNITES US HOWEVER IS OUR STEADFAST COMMITMENT FOR OUR PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY AS PROPERTY TAX ADMINISTRATORS. MY COMMENTS WILL ONLY ADDRESS THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES WITH THE SPLIT ROLE BALLOT INITIATIVE. THE CALIFORNIA- OF. CALIFORNIA SISTERS ASSOCIATION HAS COMPLETED A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SPLIT ROLE BALLOT MEASURE WITH ONLY ONE QUESTION IN MIND CAN ASSESSORS IMPLEMENT THE INITIATIVE OUR CONCLUSION IS WE CANNOT. IT WOULD E IMPOSSIBLE NOT DIFFICULT BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMINISTER ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE MEASURE AS IT IS WRITTEN. LAST WEEK THE CALIFORNIA SUCH AS ASSOCIATION VOTED TO FORMALLY OPPOSE THE SPLIT LAUREL INITIATING. THE BIG PROBLEM FOR ASSESSORS AS MANY IS THE MANY EXCLUSIONS. A REASSESSMENT IN THE INITIATIVE. FOR EXAMPLE IF IT EXCLUDES REASSESSMENT OF SMALL BUSINESSES SOUNDS GOOD. WELL MOST SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T OWN PROPERTY THEY PAY THE PROPERTY TAXES THROUGH THEIR LEAKS SO MOST ALL SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS WOULD NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF THE EXCLUSION. THE SPLIT ROLE EXCLUDES OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTY IN WHICH THE FAIR MARKET VALUE IS LESS THAN THREE MILLION STATE WHY. FIRST A SET ONLY KNOW THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. QUITE AT THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR NEW CONSTRUCTION AFTER THAT WE ONLY TRACK ASSESSED BALLOT. ASSESSORS CANNOT DETERMINE THE AGGREGATE- MARKET VALUE OF MULTIPLE PROPERTIES IN MULTIPLE COUNTS. THERE'S ALSO A RELATED PROBLEM THE THREE MILLION CAP THE THREE MILLION DOLLAR CAP IS ADJUSTED BY ANNUALLY BY COUNTY BASED UPON A LOCAL INFLATION FACTOR DETERMINED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THE RESULT IS OVER TIME DIFFERENT INFLATION FACTORS IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES SO YOU CAN HAVE IDENTICAL PROPERTY SAID TWO IDENTICAL TACO BELLS IN ADJACENT COUNTIES OFTEN THREE OR FOUR MILES APART WITH DIFFERENT INFLATION FACTOR. THE RESULT EXACT PROPERTIES WILL EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT ASSESSED VALUES OVER TIME. FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS ASSESSORS HAVE DONE A DEEP DIVE INTO THE FINANCIAL pSPLIT ROLE. FIRST WE SURVEYED ASSESSORS REGARDING THE IMPACT THE SPLIT ROLE WOULD HAVE ON STAFFING AND WORK LOOK. THEN WE COMMISSION TO NONPARTISAN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS I CAPITAL MATRIX WHICH CONCLUDED THAT ARE ESTIMATES WERE WAY LOW. AND THAT THE ESTIMATED COST TO IMPLEMENT THE INITIATIVE OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROPOSED THREE YEAR PHASE IN. IS JUST OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS STATE WHY AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COMMENSURATE INCREASE IN COST. FOR COUNTY CONTROLLERS TAX COLLECTORS ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARDS OR COUNTY COUNCIL. THE BALLOT MEASURE REQUIRES AS WE KNOW THE REASSESSMENT OF ALL COMMERCIAL. PROPERTIES TO MARKET VALUE EVERY THREE YEARS. WHAT HAPPENS AT THE GREAT RECESSION OR A PANDEMIC OCCURS IN YOUR NUMBER TWO. AND THE PROPERTY VALUES DROPPED BY 50% AS THEY DID DURING THE GREAT RECESSION REQUIRING ANNUAL REVIEW OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY ELIMINATING THE BENEFIT OF SPREADING THE REASSESSMENTS OVER THREE YEARS. ASSESSMENT APPEALS WOULD SKYROCKET. AT THE VERY LEAST EVERY COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNED PRIOR TO SAY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT PICK YOUR DATE WOULD APPEAL. WHY NOT MUCH TO BE GAINED WITH LOW RICK'S. SANTA CLARA COUNTY WE RECEIVE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AMERICAN COMMERCIAL APPEALS LAST YEAR THAT'S FAIRLY NORMAL. CONSERVATIVELY WE PROJECT THAT WE WOULD RECEIVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND APPEALS IN THE FIRST YEAR. IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY TO RESOLVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COMMERCIAL APPEAL WHEN WE WILL BE. ASSESSORS WOULD TRANSFER APPRAISAL RESOURCES FROM ENROLLING NEW CONSTRUCTION AND CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP. WHERE THE REAL REVENUE IS TO DEFENDING APPEALS JEOPARDIZING CURRENT CROP PROPERTY TAXES. THE SPLIT ROLL INITIATIVE. WOULD WOULD WOULD BE AN INVITATION TO ADJUDICATE APPEALS IN COURT RATHER THAN THE THAN BEFORE THE LOCAL ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD CREATING A MONUMENTAL INCREASE IN THE COST OF RESOLVING APPEAL. IT TAKES ME FIVE YEARS TO TAKE AN ENTRY LEVEL APPRAISER AND PUT THAT APPRAISER IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN WHERE THEY CAN APPRAISE IT CAN ASSESS. SHOPPING CENTERS ON OFF BUILDINGS THE BALLOT MEASURE GIVES IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. YOU KNOW. IT'S REALLY. WELL LET ME CONCLUDE BY BY SAYING THIS WHENEVER GOVERNMENT PROMISES SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE A CHEAT IT JUST INCREASES THE MISTRUST AND CYNICISM THAT THE PUBLIC HAS TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT ELECTED OFFICIALS THIS IS A SERIOUSLY FLAWED BALLOT MEASURE IN IT SHOULD BE DEFEATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MEMBERS DO ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE DRAWING GO FIRST I HAVE ACTUALLY THREE QUESTIONS MY FIRST QUESTIONS FOR THE LA L. ONE OF THE OPPONENTS BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT THE TRIPLE NET LEASES WILL HAVE AFFECTS ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND MY QUESTION WOULD BE HAS YOUR ANALYSIS TAKEN THAT INTO- INTO CONSIDERATION WHICH I KNOW YOU DID MENTION IT DOES BUT HOW. AND THEN ALSO DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT THAT RELIEF WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IF IN FACT- THAT TRIPLE NET LEASE OBVIOUSLY WOULD INCREASE THE COST TO SMALL BUSINESS. YES THANK YOU SO THE PRIMARY CHARGE OF OUR- ANALYSIS IS TO LOOK AT THE MEASURES FISCAL FAX- ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE MEASURE- CAN PLAY INTO- THE ESTIMATES OF THE PHYSICAL BUT THEY ARE KIND OF THE- THE PRIMARY- ANALYSIS FOR A MEASURE SO. QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW KIND OF ECONOMIC POLICY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT AFFECT SMALL BUSINESSES WERE WERE NOT REALLY WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF ESTIMATING THE PROPERTY TAX AFFECTS FROM THE MEASURE. THANK YOU I MEAN WOULD YOU A TEST THAT. POTENTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE OF THAT TRAFFIC TROUBLE NEED NOT LEASE COSTS THAT SMALL BUSINESS WOULD BE AFFECTED. ALTHOUGH THE PROP UP OTHER THE PROPOSITION WAS WRITTEN TO TRY NOT TO THINK SMALL BUSINESS OR WOULD BE STILL AND AFFECT ON SMALL BUSINESS. I THINK I WOULD SAY THAT- IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED SMALL BUSINESS- THAT COULD BE A RENTING THEIR SPACE- IN A BUILDING. THAT WOULD NOT BE EXEMPT UNDER THIS THIS MEASURE FROM THE SHIFT TO A MARKET VALUE TAXATION- AND- DESPITE TEN GAUGES. I THINK FAIRLY A REASONABLE REMARKS ABOUT A COMMERCIAL RENTS BEING SET BY LARGELY BY KIND OF MOVE THE MARKET RATES THERE COULD POTENTIALLY BE SOME SITUATIONS WHERE. LANDLORDS FACING PROPERTY TAX INCREASES COULD SEEK TO RENEGOTIATE LEASES OVER TIME OKAY THANK YOU. ARE MY NEXT QUESTION IS TO THE OPPONENTS SOME PEOPLE CONTEND THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND EQUITABLY FAVORS LONGSTANDING BUSINESSES OVER NEWER BUSINESSES BY A CREATING A PERPETUAL COME AT PERPETUAL COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PROPERTIES ARE SOLD IN THE PAST AND THE WAY THAT PROPERTIES ARE SOLD- IN THEIR DEALS COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT CRITICISM. NOT THE ONLY OF THE OPPONENTS. WELL THERE YEAH BECAUSE THE PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM IS SO DIVERSE DEPENDING ON HOW LONG YOU'VE OWNED YOUR PROPERTY IF YOU'RE A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNER- THERE IS TREMENDOUS DISPARITY. IN HIS SO WHEN YOU TRY TO Q. OR- THOSE DISPARITIES WITH ONE BALLOT MANAGER AT ONE TIME IT CREATES IT WILL CREATE TREMENDOUS DESTRUCTION IN THE SYSTEM. LBC WINNERS THEY'LL BE LOSERS- AND- I MEAN THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I THINK. I THINK- AND THEN FOR THE PROPONENTS CAN YOU ADDRESS THE ASSESSORS CONCERN ON ACTUALLY DOING DOING ACTUAL LEGWORK OF THE PROPOSITION. THIS IS TIM GAUGE I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT- WE SPENT- NUMEROUS HOURS IN CONVERSATION WITH THE- ASSESSORS- OVER THE LAST PERIOD OF THREE TO FOUR YEARS IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS- AND PART OF WHAT'S INCLUDED IN- THIS MEASURE IS A RE WRITE OF A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS. TO DEAL WITH- SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS SO FOR EXAMPLE- THE CONCERN THAT THE SISTERS WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME IN ORDER TO TRAIN STAFF. AND GET UP TO SPEED- THE MEASURE IS EXPLICITLY WRITTEN TO PROVIDE THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO CONVENE A TASK FORCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF. LOOKING AT WHAT WOULD BE INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTATION AND THEIR- THE ASSESSORS ARE CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY TO BE A MEMBER THAT TASK FORCE AND THE LEGISLATURE- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. HAS THE AUTHORITY TO STAND- PHASE IN PERIOD- SO IN THE MEASURE RIGHT NOW IT'S A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS. STARTING WITH- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- THE MEASURE SPECIFIES THAT THERE HAS TO BE AT LEAST A THREE YEAR PHASE IN PERIOD BUT THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD EXTEND THAT. BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ASSESSORS- SECOND- THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT COST- TWO COMMENTS ONE IS I THINK MR STUFF. LA THE US OF COP WE HAVE NOT LOOKED SPECIFICALLY- OR MADE AN ESTIMATE SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE START UP COSTS-WOULD BE BUT WE DID LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF WHAT THE ON GOING COSTS WOULD BE IN OUR BEST SENSE IS THAT THEY WOULD BE LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. ONCE THE MEASURES THAT. WITH RESPECT TO THE- START UP COSTS WHOEVER HAS THE MEASURE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE MEASURE SPECIFIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE. IS TO PROVIDE A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR THE START COSTS WHICH WOULD THEN BE PAID BACK FROM THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THE MEASURE ITSELF SO. THAT THE- RELATE TO OR THE CONCERN RELATED TO START UP COSTS- SIX THREE ONE WITHOUT A- FOUNDATION BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THOSE START UP COSTS ARE ALL COVERED BY THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THE MEASURE. AND THEN LASTLY WITH RESPECT TO- ASSESSMENT APPEALS- MR STONE- ARGUED THAT THE- NUMBER OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE- WE UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN WE MADE CHANGES. IN THE MEASURE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS PROCESS WOULD BE HANDLED- SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF. TRYING TO REDUCE THE- NUMBER OF APPEALS WOULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MULLIN. OF THANK YOU RESPECTIVE OF MADAME SHARES MY QUESTION IS FOR ASSESSOR STONE AND I DON'T KNOW BRIAN HAS ANYTHING TO ADD ON THIS BUT AT IN THE REPORTS SPLIT ROLE IMPLEMENTATION ESTIMATE ACOSTA COUNTY ASSESSOR'S THERE'S REFERENCE TO THE MEASURE ALLOWING COUNTIES TO WITHHOLD SOME PORTION OF ANY NET ADDITIONAL REVENUES RESULTING FROM THE MEASURE TO COVER THEIR COSTS OF IMPLEMENTATION. AND I APOLOGIZE IF THIS IS BEEN **** A DIFFICULT TO CATCH ALL THE AUDIO HERE- BUT ASSESSOR STONE ARE YOU. SUGGESTING THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LIKE FLEXIBILITY WITH WITH THAT MECHANISM TO RECOUP THE COSTS IN TERMS OF- REIMBURSEMENTS TO THE ASSESSORS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION. WE WOULD HAVE TO ASSESSORS WOULD HAVE TO FRONT COST IF YOU WILL- THE START UP. IN EXCHANGE FOR THE FOR THE MEASURE THAT SAYS WE WOULD BE REIMBURSED. WELL LET ME JUST GIVE AND HE'S- GIVE AN EXAMPLE. THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR EXCLUSION OF THE ASSESSMENT OF BUSINESS PROPERTY. WOULD IN SOME SMALL CAN. EXCEED THE ANTICIPATED REVENUES FROM THE SPLIT ROLE IN OTHER WORDS A PROPERTY TAX REVENUE REDUCTION. WHAT HAPPENS ALL IT IS THAT THAT. THAT SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS THOSE SMALL COUNTIES WOULD BE VERY RETICENT ABOUT YEAH FRONT MONEY VIA THE START UP COSTS WHEN THEY COULD GET THEY HAD NO EXPECTATION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ANY REVENUE COMING FROM THE SPLIT ROLE MEASURE ITSELF. SO THIS WHOLE IDEA PARTICULARLY IN THE IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW WHERE BUDGET CUTS IN STAFF CUTS ALL ACROSS THE STREET OR OR CURRENT. TO BE EXPECT. COUNTY BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS IN PARTICULAR- TO FRONT COST. SIGNIFICANT COST TO START. THIS PROCESS IN THE EXPECTATION THAT YOU MAKE MAY BE IN FOR FIVE YEARS BE REIMBURSED FOR THOSE COSTS IT'S LIKELY THAT MOST BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT ASSESSOR STONE IN TERMS OF ESPECIALLY SMALLER COUNTIES AND FRONTING MONEY AND SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES THERE BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE MEASURE THAT WOULD PREVENT. ALL OF OUR COUNTIES FROM FROM BEING MADE WHOLE IN TERMS OF THE COST OF THE ACTUAL. ADMINISTRATION OF THIS THIS NEW BURGER CORRECT I MEAN THIS THIS. THERE'S A FLEXIBILITY THERE TO RECOUP THOSE COSTS OVER TIME I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT UP FRONT CONCERNED HOWEVER BRICK BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT YOU FROM RECOUPING ALL OF THOSE COSTS OVER TIME CORRECT. IF YOU ASSUME THAT THE REVENUE IS GOING TO COME IN AS I SAID I BELIEVE IN THE ASSESSORS BELIEVE. THAT THAT THAT THE PROJECTIONS ON SIX TO ELEVEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF REVENUE IS NOT GOING TO BE. ANYWHERE NEAR THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY AND THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS OF THE CHEATING THAT- THERE'S I THINK. COUNTIES WOULD BE RESIDENT ABOUT THAT THE MEASURE PROVIDES THAT EXCEPT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. OKAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT. MADAM CHAIR THIS IS TEN GAUGE I WONDER IF I CAN ADDRESS- MISTER STONES- ONE OF MR STONE'S COMMENT. YES. THE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE MEASURE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE START UP COSTS SO I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT THE SENSORS NEEDING TO. HEY FOR THOSE COSTS UP FRONT GIVEN THAT PROVISION WHICH IS NOT. SIMPLY AN AUTHORIZATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SO BUT IS MANDATORY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ASK. AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA IS IN DIRE NEED OF AN INCREASE IN SCHOOL FUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE CRITICISMS THAT MANY BUSINESSES ARE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. ANYONE IF YOU COULD ANSWER. CHARLIE GRAY HERE I REALLY LIKE TO RESPOND YEAH PLEASE AND I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION ACT WE CONSIDER THE FUTURE WE KNOW THAT THAT WE OPENING OUR SCHOOLS WILL BE ACT IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAT. MAIN STREET CALIFORNIA EDUCATE THERE WERE NINE POINT CHOOSE ONLY IN A PRESCHOOL THREE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS INVOLVED AT THE PRE SCHOOL ELEMENTARY OR SECONDARY SCHOOL LEVEL WE KNOW THAT FOR OUR BUSINESSES FIVE HAVE WORKED. AFTER PREPARED HIGHLY. AND DIVERSE. BACK HOME WITH POSSIBLE WITH SCHOOL BETTER EQUIPPED TO EDUCATE PREPARE CHILDREN TO BE THAT WORK FOR YOU IF YOU GOT WHAT. SCOLDED FOR OFF. SURE HAS CHEN GARNERED ONE PLACE SEVEN MILLION SIGNATURE I THE FORT AND IT WOULD READ AN TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS EVERY OUR LOCAL. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AND IN FACT AND CRITICAL LOCAL SERVICES THAT WE ALL RELY ON. JOE THIS IS JOHN PAUL THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR HER. YEAH I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT I THINK THE IG. A RELEASE FROM CEO MAGAZINE THIS WEEK A REVIEW BELIEVE FOR THE FOURTEENTH TIME IN A ROW FORTY YEARS IN A ROW CALIFORNIA WAS RAIDED DEVIL LAST AS A PLACE IN WHICH TO DO BUSINESS THE BUSINESS CLIMATE HERE. IS NOT VERY POSITIVE ALL OF US IN VIRTUALLY EVERY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND SENATE DISTRICT KNOWS BUSINESSES WITH OUR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SOME OF THEM VERY VERY LARGE BUSINESSES- SOME OF THEM SMALL BUSINESSES. BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PROTECTING OUR UP BUSINESS BASE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WILL BE PAYING THE TAXES- GOING. AND THE NOTION THAT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN SAYING IN A SMALLER SHARE. OF THE PROPERTY TAX BY THE WHOLE PROPERTY TAX PROBABLY I WANT TO PUSH BACK WILL GET. BACK AGAINST A TEN GAUGE A LITTLE BIT. THAT IS DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY LAND KEEPS KEEP IN MIND SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA BOSS. THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE HAS SHRUNK. SO THE PROPORTION. OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE RELATIVE BETWEEN COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL IS REALLY AN AN IRRELEVANT. FIGURE BECAUSE IS DRIVEN MORE BY LAND USE POLICIES NOT TAX POLICY. ANY OTHER COMMENT TO MY QUESTION. BETTER THIS TIME GATE YOU YOU HAD- ASKED FOR COMMENT WITH RESPECT TO- INFRASTRUCTURE- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED THIS MUCH MUCH THUS FAR. IN TODAY'S- HEARING IS THE FACT THAT BECAUSE THE REASSESSMENT OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTY WOULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND THE PROPERTY TAX BASE THAT TAKES TAX BASED NOT ONLY HAS THE ONE PERCENT- TAX APPLIED TO IT BUT ALSO THE- VOTER OVERRIDE RATE. AS A CONSEQUENCE- THIS WOULD INCREASE THE FISCAL CAPACITY THE STATE TO SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IN A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL FASHION- AYE MITCHELL LITTLE EARLIER MY REMARKS THAT THEN SCHOOLS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE IN A POSITION. TO PROVIDE MORE IN THE WAY OF INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULARLY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHERE- MANY OF THOSE FACILITIES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. OKAY I HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS AND ONE HANDED OFF TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUNE. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INITIATIVE SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTS RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IS INVOLVED SAID YET OPPONENTS MATERIALS AND WEBSITES HAVE CALL THIS INITIATIVE AND ATTACK ON HOMEOWNERS. WOULD YOU CALL THAT STATEMENT CORRECT AND ACCURATE. OF THIS IS THE THIS DRUG POLICY YES I THINK AGAIN WE HAVE PUBLIC STATEMENTS WHICH- WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE FROM PROPONENTS ARE INTEREST SOCIO THE PERFORMANCE- COMING OUT AND SAYING QUITE CLEARLY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IF ANYBODY BELIEVES. THE LAWSUIT PROPOSITION THIRTEEN FOR BUSINESS PROPERTIES IS SIMPLY THE FIRST STEP I THINK I THINK THERE'D BE FLOWN SO. I THINK THERE IS A CLEAR AGENDA HERE TO- DISMANTLE ALL THE PROJECT PROPOSITION THIRTY. FOR THE EFFORT THE NFIB REPORTS OF MOST SMALL BUSINESSES OPERATE FROM THEIR HOME SO WHAT THE SAME SMALL BUSINESSES BE EXAM. UNDER THE MEASURE THEY WOULD BE YES MADAM CHAIRMAN. ANY OTHER COMMENT. I GUESS THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS IT FOR A HOME BASED BUSINESS- WHAT IS THE PENALTY FOR NOT SECURING YOUR BUSINESS LICENSE AND- IN IN OUR IT AS THERE IS A SHIFT TOWARD HOME BASED BUSINESSES ARE THEY'RE GONNA BE ZONING RESTRICTIONS AND ARE THEY GOING TO BE ENFORCEMENT OF. GENERAL PLANNING AND ZONING LAWS WITH RESPECT TO OPERATING A BUSINESS OUT OF YOUR HOME THERE SO. I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THE HOME BASED BUSINESSES DO FEAR AND THAT IS OF THE FACT THAT- SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT DISEASE WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE. WHO HAS A BUSINESS LICENSE AND WHAT WHAT HAVE THEY IDENTIFIED AS THEIR ADDRESS AND WHETHER OR NOT OPERATING A BUSINESS IS CONSISTENT. WITH THE LAND USE POLICIES OF THAT CITY SO I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN THAT WOULD ALL HAVE TO LOOK. LOOK AT GOING FORWARD. IN MY LAST SURE I NAY YES IT IF I NAY CAROLING GREAT HERE. I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THAT THE RICH THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN. THAT COME FROM IT 6% OF THE MOST VALUABLE. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY IN THE STATE. AND I THINK THAT IT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT THE WEALTHIER. AND COUNTIES ARE I'M PUSHING BACK ON THERE IF THE- IF THEY WOULD HAVE TO IS BACK UP. SHARE WE NEED TO INCLUDE CLOSE IN THE MEDIAN IN WE NEED THE- REASON WHY BUSINESSES. OUT OF THEIR HOME THEY SPEAK. COMMERCIAL PROPERTY THAT VERY RATE THAT BY THE MARKET NOT BY THE PROPERTY TAX. AND WE DO NOT LEAVE THE HOLDERS THAT THE PROPERTY PASSING PROPERTY TAX BEIJING ON THE TOPIC THAT THEY DON'T DO THAT WE NEED AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SCHOOLS AND IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THEY'RE. FUNDING ALLOW THAT. YOU'VE MADAM CHAIR OF THIS IS LARRY STONE AGAIN MAY I COMMENT ON ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT CAME GAUGE THEY. THE ART REGARDING THE COSTS AND WHETHER THEY'RE BEING REIMBURSED OR NOT. UP THE BIGGEST COST IN ANY ASSESSOR'S OFFICES PERSONNEL. MY OFFICE IT'S OVER 90% I WOULD HAVE TO DOUBLE MY APPRAISAL STAFF. ALL THAT MEANS IN MY COUNTY FIFTY NEW SENIOR APPRAISERS EXPERIENCED IN LA COUNTY IT'S FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NEW APPRAISER AND WOULD HAVE TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS BECAUSE IT TAKES FIVE YEARS TO TAKE A- IT LEVEL PREVIEW. THEY CAN DO HIGH LEVEL COMMERCIAL ASSESSMENTS AND APPRAISALS. ARE WE WOULD NEED THAT FUNDING RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T THINK THE MEASURE PROVIDES FOR THOSE KINDS OF INCREASED COSTS NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE ASSESSORS BUT BUT FOR. THE TAX COLLECTOR THE CONTROLLER- THE COUNTY COUNCILS OF. YEAH WE WOULD HAVE TO BEGIN TO MAKE THOSE EXPENDITURES IN TRAINING EXPENDITURES UP VERY VERY QUICKLY THANK. SOUNDS LIKE A JOB OPPORTUNITY. OKAY MY FINAL QUESTION IS AND AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF INTERNET FOR ALL AND THAT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE SO. AS I STATED THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EVEN BEFORE THE BUDGET CRISIS WERE THE DIRE NEED OF INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. SCHOOLS BROADBAND FOR RURAL AREAS PUBLIC SAFETY FACILITIES AND THE LIKE. YOU OPPOSE THIS AN INITIATIVE BUT HOWARD JARVIS THE CHAMBER AND WAS STATEWIDE BUSINESS. THE INITIATIVE ONLY ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PRESENT AN INITIATIVE TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND A LOWER 55% RATHER THAN A TWO THIRDS SUPERMAJORITY. YOU OPPOSE IT EVEN AFTER WE ADDED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AUDITS AND EXPENDITURE PLAN CITIZENS COMMISSION AND A PROVISION PREVENTING A BUSINESS ONLY TAX AT THE REQUEST OF THE STATE CHAMBER. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD EVER SUPPORT. YES IT'S JUST THAT THIS JOB ALL OF THE YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT- WE HAVE A PERIODIC REVIEW TAX CREDITS AND THINGS CALL TAX EXPENDITURES AND UP WE WOULDN'T DENY THAT PERHAPS OF OVERALL REVIEW. SO CALLED TAX EXPENDITURES WHICH SOME PEOPLE CALLED LOOPHOLES MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BUT ONLY IF COUPLED WITH A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF HOW WE SPEND MONEY CALIFORNIA HAS PERHAPS THE- MOST. SAMPLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL BLOOM DAHLE THE MOTORS HIGH SPEED RAIL AND WHY LEGISLATURE'S CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR PROJECT WASTING PROBABLY A MILLION DOLLARS A DAY ON A PROJECT THAT MOST INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION EXPERTS. AND WILL NOT EVER BE COMPLETED SO OF. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT WE WOULD SUPPORT A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE REVIEWS OF ALL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND HAVE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE OPERATE MORE LIKE THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE THAT NORMALLY DOES FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT BUT ALSO PERFORMED. I THINK THAT'S LONG OVERDUE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD YOU NOT AGREE THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. YES THEY ARE THEY HAVE TO HAVE BALANCED BUDGETS BUT I WOULD PUSH BACK ON THE TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE MUCH OF THE- COST DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- HAS TO DO WITH THE- A CONTRACTS THEY THEY FIND WITH THE- PUBLIC SECTOR. EMPLOYMENT EUROPEANS AND MOST OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WE ARE BIXEL. OF WHAT ARE CALLED HE COIN INITIATIVE WE- YEAH. LABOR BUT THE VOTERS. WELL I JUST WANT A REMINDER THE INITIATIVE THAT WE TRIED TO GET THROUGH IS JUST JUST TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PRESENT AN INITIATIVE WE DIDN'T A LOT OF A- WE JUST ASK THEM THAT. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ELSE HAVE A COMMENT TO MY COMMENT. ALL RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST VERY QUICKLY- ALL I. AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS INITIATIVE JUST BECAUSE HE REALLY EXCLUDE THAT THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY YOU KNOW PERSONALLY I WILL NOT SUPPORT. A CHAIN ANY CHANGES TO THE- THE PER DAY- A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY AND I DON'T THINK THE VOTERS WAS THEIR- I THINK THE- INITIATIVE. ACTUALLY ASKING DOES BUSINESS LARGE OR SMALL TO REALLY DO MORE TO CONTRIBUTE. TO THEIR LOCAL GOOD DAY LOCAL COMMUNITY WE'RE THEIR EMPLOYEE AND THEIR FAMILY CALL HOME SO. THANK YOU. THING NO MORE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WILL NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. I WILL BEGIN BY RECOGNIZING FIVE INDIVIDUALS IN THE GALLEY WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS INITIATIVE FOR UP TO ONE MINUTE EACH. I WOULD NOW ASK HER ON A- SO NO. OKAY I DO NOT SEE ANY ONE IN THE GALLEY FOR SUPPORT SO NOW. FOR YEAH IN SUPPORT OKAY YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE FOR EACH ONE OF YOU UP TO FIVE PEOPLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WOMEN- TERRY BRENNAN BEHALF MESS YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA. IN SUPPORT WE REPRESENT THEIR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA- INCLUDING THE- PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO WORK IN MISTER STONE'S OFFICE IN.
