BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MEMBERS HERE- AND THAT WOULD BE AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY THREE BY MAIL- PATRICK O'DONNELL ME. AND I'LL TURN THE GAVEL OVER WELL NOT THE GALA BECAUSE WE DON'T OF A QUORUM YET. BUT- IF WE WILL NOW CHAIR THE COMMITTEE. YEAH. MISTER CHAIR PLEASE PROCEED. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AN ITEM ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU ABOUT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS UNBELIEVABLY BEEN FROZEN FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS THAT'S THE FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN FROZEN FOR FORTY YEARS TO VIEW OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS AND USE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION THAT IS FROM HOME TO SCHOOL SCHOOL BACK HOME. FUNDING LEVELS HAVE REMAINED FLAT FOR EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT SINCE THE EARLY EIGHTIES FUNDING HAS NEVER BEEN ADJUSTED FOR POPULATION CHANGES OR PROGRAM GROWTH LEADING TO CASES WERE NEARLY IDENTICAL DISTRICTS WITH NEARLY IDENTICAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS RECEIVE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF STATE FUNDING FOR THIS CRITICAL. AND FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES MANDATORY SERVICE. ADDITIONALLY THE HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM DOES NOT RECEIVE A COLA COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT INCREASE ANNUALLY- AS COSTS INCREASED AS DO OTHER. PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY REIMBURSES SCHOOLS FOR LESS THAN TRANSPORTATION COSTS. ON AVERAGE WITH DOZENS OF DISTRICTS RECEIVING LESS THAN TEN CENTS. ON THE DOLLAR THAT'S THE DOLLAR THEY SPEND ON HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION. CONSEQUENTLY CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTS THE LOWEST SHARE OF ITS PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS TO SCHOOL THAN ANY OTHER STATE. DENYING OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. THOUGH THE WELL DOCKET AT THE END COMMUNITIES OF TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOL- ADDITIONALLY SCHOOLS THAT RECEIVE MINIMAL STATE SUPPORT MUST SPEND DISTRICT GENERAL FUND REVENUE ON TRANSPORTATION. DIVERTING RESOURCES OUT OF THE CLASSROOM AB TWO NINE THREE THREE WOULD FULLY FUND THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM EMPOWERING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TRANSFER ALL CHILDREN. TRANSPORT ALL CHILDREN TO AND FROM SCHOOL BY REIMBURSING 1100% OF THEIR TRUE EXPENSES. THE FUNDING FORMULA REFLECTS REGIONAL COST DIFFERENCES AND INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR OUR STATE OF RURAL SUBURBAN AND URBAN AREAS AB TWO NINE THREE THREE ALSO PROVIDES FOR FUTURE PROGRAM GROWTH AS SCHOOLS INCREASE OUR CAPACITY. TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND REQUIRING MORE BUSES AND ROADS. THESE COSTS WILL BE COVERED FOR EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND EVERY CHILD ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE INANE NASH PRESIDENT OF THE EUREKA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND BOARD ON BEHALF OF OUR AREA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION AND ALSO. RIGHT MAKE FADDEN SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NEVADA JOINT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MA MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM INDEED RENEE NASH PRESIDENT OF THE WEEKEND SCHOOL TO SUPPORT OF TRUSTEES AND MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CSPA. HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF C-SPAN IS NEARLY ONE THOUSAND MEMBER DISTRICTS AS A SPONSOR IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS LEGISLATION AS YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS STRUGGLED IN DISTRICTS OF STRUGGLED OVER THE PAST FORTY YEARS TO ADEQUATELY FUND HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION. OVER THIS TIME THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION IN CALIFORNIA FROM GAS PRICES QUITMAN AND STAFFING COSTS AS WELL AS EFFORTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM DIESEL FUEL HAVE GROWN DRAMATICALLY IT FUNDING FOR THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM HAS BEEN FROZEN WITHOUT A COLON. AS A RESULT MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECEIVE LESS THAN 30% OF FUNDING FOR THE ACTUAL COSTS WHICH FOR MANY DISTRICTS HAS BECOME UNSUSTAINABLE IN EUREKA WE SPEND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AVERAGE PER SPREAD STUDENT WITH NO FEDERAL OR STATE REIMBURSEMENT. WITH LIMITED FUNDING MANY DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO MAKE THE CRITICAL DECISION TO REDUCE OUR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO ONLY THOSE THAT ARE FEDERALLY MANDATED MOST DETRIMENTAL IS AND IT ADEQUATE FUNDING HAS CREATED IN EQUITY AND ARE STILL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. RESULTING IN DISPARITIES ACROSS THE STATE AS TO WHICH STUDENTS RECEIVE A SAFE RIDE TO AND FROM SCHOOL. THAT IS WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS CRITICALLY NEEDED AND WHY C. S. B. A. IS SUCH STRONG SUPPORTER. THIS BILL WOULD FULLY FUND THIS ESSENTIAL PROGRAM AND ENABLE ALL STUDENTS TO RECEIVE A SAFE RIDE TO SCHOOL ALL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE SAFEST WAY FOR STUDENTS TO GET TO AND FROM SCHOOL IS ON A SCHOOL BUS. REIMBURSING DISTRICTS 41100% OF THEIR ACTUAL EXPENSES. THE BILL ESTABLISHES AN ADAPTIVE FUNDED FORMULA THAT REFLECTS THE REGIONAL COST DIFFERENTIALS AND FUTURE PROGRAM GROWTH. WHICH IS CRUCIAL IN THE STATE IS LARGE AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA. THE BILL ADDRESSES THE REAL COST OF PROVIDING SCALE AND PROVIDES A SCHOOL BUS IN WITHOUT DEPRIVING STUDENTS OF RESOURCES PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. IN THE CLASSROOM OR MONIES IS NEEDED SO THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE TO DIVERT MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TO ADDRESS. THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT ARE GOING TO PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION BOTH FOR GENERAL FUND AS WELL. AS FOR GENERAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS BECAUSE THE ENCROACHMENT HAS BECOME UNBEARABLE FOR MANY DISTRICTS. TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE ELIMINATING THE GENERAL EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND WE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRETT MCFADDEN OVER THE HONOR TO BE THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NEVADA JOINT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT JUST ABOUT TWENTY MILES NORTH OF THE AUBURN AREA AND WE ARE A HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT WE SERVE GRADES TWELVE NINE THROUGH TWELVE AND HAVE AN ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM I'M A CONCUR WITH THEM- THE REMARKS OF MIKE- CALLING MISS NASH AND APPRECIATE SOME WOMEN FOR SPONSORING THIS THIS BILL- WE TRANSPORT WERE ONE OF THE DISTRICTS AND ACTUALLY TRANSPORTS A LITTLE OVER 50% OF OUR STUDENTS AS A RESULT OF. BEING IN A RURAL AREA AND I WILL- OUR RESEARCH. EMPHASIZE MY REMARKS IN THE AREA OF. HOW SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS SCHOOLS AND FROM AN ACADEMIC STANDPOINT. WHEN STUDENTS ARE TRANSPORTED DAILY BY SCHOOL BUSES THEY'RE SAFER- THEY ARRIVE ON TIME THEY HAVE GREATER ATTENDANCE. AND FROM AN EQUITY STANDPOINT PARTICULARLY FOR OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT- DUE TO SOCIO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR GEOGRAPHICALLY DRITTE GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS. I HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING TO SCHOOL ON A DAILY BASIS AND- IS. THERE SOME AMEND NOTED WE HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST- TRANSPORTATION RATES OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH. GETTING CARS OFF THE ROAD AND- SAFETY BENEFITS AS WELL SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THIS WOULD BE IS- THE SUPPORT WOULD BE STATEWIDE AMONG DISTRICTS FROM THEIR- URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL ARENA SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

JEFF BARKER REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IN THE TWENTY THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUPERINTENDENTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU WE DO NOT HAVE ANY REGISTERED OPPOSITION AS ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. A TO CLOSE MR ARE YES THANK YOU MANAGER JUST ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OF THE MEMBERS WHEN WE ESTABLISH BORN. THANK YOU. OKAY I SEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA IS HERE YOU MAY. SHE HAS- US FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE WE LOOK NORMAL GOODNESS CALDERON ON CONSENT. OKAY WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS ARE OKAY WITH THAT WELL I'LL GO TO A FILE NUMBER ONE EIGHTY TWO FOUR EIGHT FOUR I MISS BONTA MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AND MEN MEN'S TO ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT A CHARTERS NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION BE DISSOLVED FOR REMAINING NET ASSETS TO BE ALLOCATED AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR ACCOMPLISHES TWO GOALS. ONE IS THE FIRST IS THAT THE BILL INCREASES IN ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE EVENT THAT A CHARTER SCHOOL SHUTS ITS DOORS SECOND THIS BILL CLOSES A LOOPHOLE AND HOW CHARTER SCHOOL SPENDS A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS. WHILE THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY INCREASED STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS CHARTER SCHOOL CLOSURES WITHOUT A CLEAR ROAD MAP FOR HOW TO MANAGE THEM WHEN THEY WHEN THIS DOES HAPPEN ARE PARTICULARLY DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA ON AVERAGE. AN AVERAGE OF THREE CHARTER SCHOOLS CLOSE BETWEEN THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER AND APRIL THESE MID YEAR CLOSURES ARE DESTRUCTIVE AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT NOT ONLY STUDENTS BUT ALSO NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS MUST ACCOMMODATE THE INFLUX OF STUDENTS BY FINDING CLASSROOM SPACE HIRING TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF PURCHASING INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND TRANSFERRING RECORDS MID YEAR. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR ENHANCES CHARTER SCHOOL CLOSURES BY FIRST REQUIRING ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS TO UNIFORMLY REPORT PEOPLE INFORMATION TO KALPANA AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SECOND TRANSFERRING ANY NET REMAINING ASSETS AFTER CHARTER SCHOOL CLOSES. TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IN WHICH A CHARTER SCHOOL WAS LOCATED AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR ALSO ADDRESSES THE ISSUES OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN ACCESS MONEY FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES GRANT PROGRAM FOR RENT AND LEASE REIMBURSEMENTS ONLY HOWEVER CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PURCHASING PROPERTY THROUGH A RELATED THIRD PARTY. USING DOLLARS MEANT FOR LEASE AND RENT ASSISTANCE TO PAY FOR THAT MORTGAGE MY BILL ADDRESSES THIS BY. CAPPING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GRANT MONEY THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS MADE RECEIVED FOR A RELATED PARTY FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT. AT 1100% OF THE COST OF THE FACILITY. REQUIRING THE CHARTER SCHOOL TO MAINTAIN A DEED RESTRICTION THAT STATES THE RELATED PARTY FACILITY MAY ONLY BE USED FOR PUBLIC NONSECTARIAN EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AFTER FIFTY PERCENT. OF ITS COST IS REPAID THROUGH GRANT FUNDS AND THIRD REQUIRING THAT THE CHARTER SCHOOL. AT B. REMEMBER REIMBURSED THAT SB SEVEN FORTY PROGRAM FUND IF IT CLOSELY THE CLOSES OR SELLS OR LEASES FOR NON EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. IT'S RELATED PARTY FACILITY WITHIN TEN YEARS A RECEIVING GRANTS. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR IS A COUNT ABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND ENSURES THAT WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS CASSIE MANCINI WITH A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATHLEEN MANZINI AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD PREVENT TAXPAYER DOLLARS THOSE MEANT FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION FROM BEING USED BY PRIVATE CORPORATIONS TO AMASS REAL ESTATE. THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE SB SEVEN FORTY PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE TO PROVIDE CHARTER SCHOOL SERVING EXTREMELY LOW INCOME STUDENTS WITH ASSISTANCE FOR FACILITIES RIGHT COSTS. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THIS PROGRAM SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN WELL OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S BILLION WITH A B. HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. IN RECENT YEARS SOME LARGE CHARTER SCHOOL CHAINS HAVE EXPLOITED LOOPHOLES IN THE PROGRAM TO PURCHASE PROPERTY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITHOUT ANY TAX PAYER CLAIMS TO PROPERTY OWNERSHIP OR OVERSIGHT. AND THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS FIRST THE CHARTER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION CREATES A NON PROFIT LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY THAN THAT LOC TAKES OUT A PRIVATE LOANS- CONDUIT REVENUE BONTA PURCHASE A SCHOOL FACILITY. NEXT THAT L. L. C. LEASES THEIR FACILITY TO THE VERY CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATOR THAT CREATED TE LLC IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR SB. SEVEN FORTY LEAST REIMBURSEMENT FUNDS. OVER TIME THE LOC USES THOSE LEASE REIMBURSEMENTS TO PAY OFF THEIR ENTIRE LOAN. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE LIFETIME AMOUNT OF SB SEVEN FORTY PROGRAM FINDS A SCHOOL CAN RECEIVE. SO LONG AS IT COMPLIES WITH THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. THAT MEANS A SCHOOL CAN RECEIVE SB SEVEN FORTY FUNDS IN PERPETUITY. ONCE A LONER BOND IS FULLY REPAID THE LOC AND EFFECTIVELY THE CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATOR PRIVATELY OWNED THEIR OWN SCHOOL FACILITY THAT HAS BEEN PAID FOR ENTIRELY WITH TAXPAYER FUNDS. NOW WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT. WILL CLOSE AS WHAT HAPPENS OF ORDERS REVOKED OR DECIDES TO EXIT THE BUSINESS OF EDUCATION. WELL THE LOC IS FREE TO SELL THAT PROPERTY WHICH IS ACCRUED VALUE OVER TIME. LEASE IT TO A PRIVATE RELIGIOUS SCHOOL. OR LET IT SIT VACANT. THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT SB SEVEN FORTY DOLLARS ARE BEING ABLE USED TO PURCHASE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. FOR ONE THE TAXPAYERS HAVE NO CLAIM TO OWNERSHIP OF THESE PROPERTIES. ALTHOUGH PROPERTIES ARE PAID FOR ENTIRELY OR PARTIALLY. IT DOLLARS. LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE SCHOOL'S AUTHORIZER WILL HAVE NO SAY IN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PROPERTY AFTER THE SCHOOL CLOSES. THIS MAKES FOR AN EFFICIENT SPENDING AND BAD POLICY MAKING. AND THIS PROGRAM'S BEEN AN EXCELLENT EFFECTIVE WAY FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS TO GROW THANK YOU AT THE TAXPAYERS EXPENSE THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT. THANK YOU. OPPOSITIONS ARE OPPOSITION WHICH IS JUST ABOUT- ANY I'M SORRY ANY OTHER SUPPORT. OR GO AHEAD OF MYSELF HERE ANY OTHER SUPPORT. FIFTY MARK ON BEHALF OF CFTA UNION OF EDUCATORS AND CLASSIFIED PROFESSIONALS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER SUPPORT GOOD OPPOSITION OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE JOHN LINGER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR- ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FACILITIES CONTINUES TO BE A PRIMARY CHALLENGE FOR PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE OPERATING IN THE MOST HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES UNLIKE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE GET NOT GUARANTEED FACILITIES AND DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDING SOURCES DEDICATED FOR THOSE OF US FACILITIES. BE INEQUITABLE SITUATION REQUIRES MANY OF OUR PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS TO USE THEIR GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING TO PAY FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL IN PROVIDING PARTIAL LEASE REIMBURSEMENT TO OVER FOUR HUNDRED ELIGIBLE CHARTER SCHOOLS OPERATING AT LEAST FACILITIES IN HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR UNFORTUNATELY WOULD UNNECESSARILY DAMAGE THIS LIMITED PROGRAM. THAT IS ONE OF OUR ONLY LIFELINES TO ADEQUATE FACILITIES IN HIGH NEEDS AREAS OUR GREATEST CONCERN IS THAT THE BILL CREATES A DOUBLE STANDARD FOR SORT FACILITIES OWNED BY NON PROFITS AND THOSE LEAST BY PRIVATE LAND- INVESTORS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PUBLIC GOOD ABILITY OWNED BY A NON PROFIT MUST BE HELD FOR A PUBLIC GOOD OR SOLD FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT IF THE FACILITY IS NO LONGER NEEDED. CURRENT FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM REGULATIONS ALREADY PROVIDE SCRUTINY OF AGREEMENTS WITH AFFILIATED NONPROFITS RENDERING AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR UNNECESSARY THE EXISTING OPTION FOR NONPROFITS TO HOLD TITLE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED NOT ELIMINATED BY TARGETING FACILITIES OWNED BY NON PROFITS THIS BILL WOULD FAVOR READ. AND CONTROLLED AND TERM LEASES TO PRIVATE LANDOWNERS FOR NO SUSTAIN PUBLIC GOOD BEYOND THE TERMS OF THE TENDENCY CAPPING LEASES BASED ON PURCHASE PRICE SIGNALLERS THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OWNERS MUST MAKE TO RENDER A SITE. FIT FOR A SCHOOL AND- JUST TO CLOSE I GUESS I WOULD SAY WE ARE WE ARE ALWAYS HAPPY TO DISCUSS COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDING ADEQUATE FACILITIES FOR ALL PUBLIC STUDENTS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL MOVES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND- FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YES GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. MY NAME IS ISABEL MCDANIEL AND I AM THE PROUD PRINCIPLE OF A SPIRE ALEXANDER TWILIGHT COLLEGE PREPARATORY ACADEMY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE SPIRE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS A NONPROFIT ENTITY THAT OPERATES THIRTY SIX SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SERVING OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. OUR SCHOOL SERVES APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY T. K. THROUGH FIFTH GRADE STUDENTS 85% OF WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED MEALS. 30% OF WHOM ARE MULTI LANGUAGE LEARNERS WE HAVE A BRIGHT AND ENERGETIC AND CARING STUDENT POPULATION THAT IS EXCITED TO ENTER OUR BEAUTIFUL SCHOOL BUILDING EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND I'M HERE TODAY AWAY FROM OUR SCHOOL AWAY FROM OUR STAFF AND FOUR HUNDRED PLUS STUDENTS BECAUSE I AM PROFOUNDLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THIS BILL COULD HAVE ON THE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS LIKE MINE. ENSURING A SAFE AND ADEQUATE FACILITIES IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS FACE BECAUSE WE HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO DISTRICT FACILITIES AND LOCAL SCHOOL BONDS. FORTUNATELY THE S. B. SEVEN FORTY FACILITIES GRANT PROGRAM PROVIDES PARTIAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR LEASE COSTS AND ENSURES THAT MORE OF OUR OPERATIONAL FUNDING CAN BE SPENT IN THE CLASSROOM. WITHOUT THIS SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE PEOPLE TO TEACHER RATIOS OR ELIMINATE CORE SUPPORTS SUCH AS INTERVENTION SPECIALIST OR INSTRUCTIONAL AIDES. SO OUR FACILITY IS OWNED BY AFFILIATED NONPROFIT ENTITY GOVERNED BY NONPROFIT LAWS THAT ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE HELD% IN PUBLIC TRUST BECAUSE OUR LANDLORD IS ALSO A NONPROFIT THAT IS A LINES TO OUR MISSION WE HAVE ACCESS TO AN AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY FACILITY WE ALSO HAVE SECURITY OF A LONG TERM AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FISCAL. AND OPERATIONAL STABILITY FOR OUR STUDENTS OUR FAMILIES AND OUR STAFF THE PROTECTION IS SIMPLY NOT AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS HE MUST LEASE THROUGH PRIVATE FOR PROFIT LANDOWNERS. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR IS AN UNNECESSARY AND CONFUSING BILL THAT WOULD FUNCTION ELIMINATE THE OPTION FOR PUBLICLY TRANSPARENT AND PUBLICLY BENEFICIAL LEASE AGREEMENTS TO CONTINUE INSTEAD IT WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SCHOOLS LIKE OURS TO BE IN UNPREDICTABLE PROFIT DRIVEN SITUATION WITH LAND OWNERS THAT WOULD NOT OFFER ANY LASTING BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC. ALL STUDENTS DESERVE THE RIGHT TO A HIGH QUALITY FUNCTIONAL STABLE SCHOOL FACILITY THEREFORE WE REQUEST THAT YOU REJECT THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU I TO GET DEL WHAT WORDS I DIDN'T STAY THE BEING HERE IS TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH ARE- SO WITH THAT I IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. SEEING NO OTHER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IN THE ROOM BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- I JUST WANNA SAY MISS BONTA APPRECIATE YOUR BILL. NOT TRYING TO SHUT DOWN ANY SCHOOL. AND THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITY DOLLARS AND UP IN. THE SERVER PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN. RIGHT IT'S NOT ABOUT HELPING A PRIVATE INVESTOR AND WHAT WE FOUND IS A LOOPHOLE. THAT ALLOWS PRIVATE INVESTORS. THE END UP OWNING BUILDINGS THAT WERE BOUGHT WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS AND THAT SIMPLY. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIX HERE TODAY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR BILLS OR ANY OTHER COMMENTS READY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR BENNETT AND MR BENNETT BEFORE WE COULD BE ESTABLISH A QUORUM. O'DONNELL HERE ADULT PRESENT VALLEY. VALLEY PRESENT BENNETT HERE SENATE PRESIDENT CHEN LEAVE MCCARTY MCCARTY PRESENT QUIRK-SILVA. SO WE DO HAVE A QUORUM THE QUORUM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED MISTER BENNETT HAD SOME COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR BOTH SIDES HERE- FOR THE CHARTER SCHOOL ADVOCATES- DO YOU- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE. IS ANY MERIT TO THE ARGUMENT THAT SOME REIMBURSEMENTS ARE GOING BEYOND SCHOOL AND I BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU HAVE BOTH THE PURCHASE PRICE I'M NOT THE PURCHASE PRICE BUT YOU HAVE THE FACILITY ITSELF BUT YOU LSO HAVE IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE- SO IF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE FACILITY ARE PAID FOR- DO YOU FEELS THAT THERE'S COULD SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE REIMBURSED MUCH BEYOND THAT. BEING OUT OF SCHOOL FIGHTS- FACILITIES MAINTENANCE IS AN NGOING PROCESS IT WILL NEVER END EVERY YEAR I'M TELLING MY DAD FACILITIES MANAGER PLEASE CAN WE GET THE BLACKTOP REPAVE CAN WE FIX THE GIRLS RESTROOMS CAN. THERE IT'S NEVER ENDING PROCESS SO IF THESE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPORT THE UPKEEP OF FACILITIES AS WELL AS THE PURPOSE PURCHASE THEN IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT AND ONGOING. AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE SEVEN FORTY PROGRAM- IS A PARTIAL LEASE PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES FIRST ON LEASES AND THEN. OTHER COSTS AND SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE. IT'S PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON PARTIAL LEASE REIMBURSEMENTS WERE NOT GETTING REIMBURSED FULLY FOR THE- FOR THE FACILITY RIGHT AND SO- THEY'RE STILL MONEY COMING OUT OF THE GENERAL OPERATING. BUDGETS THIS THIS PROGRAM JUST TAKES SOME RELIEF. AWAY FROM THE GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSE AND HELPS US IN IN A LITTLE A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. THE FUNDING AVAILABLE LIKE DISTRICTS STILL AND FOR THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL- IS WHEN WE IDENTIFY A ORIGINAL COST OF THE BUILDING. OR DO WE HAVE IS THERE ANY PROVISION IN THERE FOR- THE COST OF IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE BUILDING MODIFICATIONS ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES EXCEPT. YOU KNOW THAT MY WITNESS ANSWER THAT NO FOLLOW UP. YEAH THE BILL ALLOWS FOR ON THAT COST REIMBURSEMENTS FOR FACILITIES IMPROVEMENTS IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT THOSE IF. THE 1100% THRESHOLD IS ALREADY BEEN REACHED. SO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS COULD STILL APPLY FOR PROGRAM FUNDS FOR FACILITIES IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN HOW ABOUT MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY AND MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY. THEY CAN ALSO APPLY FOR THAT. I BELIEVE. THAT IS WHAT THE CURRENT WHATEVER THE CURRENT PROGRAM REGULATIONS ALLOW THOSE FUNDS TO BE SPENT ON YES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT CLEAR FASHION TAKES AND IS MONEY CLEAR TO THE COMMITTEE. MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH- SB SEVEN FORTY THROUGH WHICH- CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN RECEIVE FACILITY FUNNY. THEY CAN BE PART OF A CAN PARTICIPATE THE STATE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM AS WELL THERE'S MONEY. FOR THEM TO DO THAT AS WELL AS ONE MAKE THAT CLEAR DOESN'T LIKE THE ONLY AVENUE FOR THEM TO GET MONEY THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES TO GET MONEY THE CONCERN HERE. IS WHEN THESE FACILITIES- AND UP IN PRIVATE HANDS A CHARTER SCHOOL CLOSES WHAT HAPPENS. RIGHT AND THEY WERE PURCHASED WITH PUBLIC MONEY. THAT THAT THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT MISS BONTA. IS TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE. PUBLIC DOLLARS A PUBLIC PROPERTY NOT PUBLIC DOLLARS BECOMING PRIVATE PROPERTY. RIGHT IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE THAT WISH TO COMMENT- WITH THAT- DO DO WE HAVE A MOTION. IT'S REMOVED IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED- YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY AGAIN OR REITERATE THAT THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM REMAINS FULLY INTACT AT THERE ISN'T A QUESTION ABOUT CHANGING ANY KIND OF ELIGIBILITY. ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AT ALL- THIS LEGISLATION AT ALL IT IS REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE UNFORTUNATE EVENT WHEN A CHARTER SCHOOL CLOSES AND BE HAVING ABSOLUTE CLARITY THAT THE DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH. AT THE SB SEVEN FORTY GRANT PROGRAM I AND AT REALLY COME BACK INTO THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND STAY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR I JUST WANT TO OFFER BY WAY OF EXAMPLE TO IT TO JUST ELUCIDATE WHAT WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO PREVENT FROM HAPPENING. AT LEAST ALLIANCE ALICE AT EXTRA COLLEGE READY HIGH SCHOOL CLOSED THE CMO ALLIANCE PURCHASED IT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE TWENTY FOURTEEN ACADEMIC YEAR. IN ACADEMIC YEAR ALLIANCE RECEIVED ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN SB SEVEN FORTY PROGRAM FUNDS FOR LEASE REIMBURSEMENTS IT IS NOW LISTED FOR SALE WITH AN ASKING PRICE OF NINE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS PRIOR HANGING OTO A PROPERTY BY SIMPLY HANG ON TO THIS PROPERTY ALLIANCE WAS ABLE TO NET NEARLY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN. PROFIT AT THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN OUT WITH SB SEVEN FORTY DOLLARS WE WANT THOSE DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK INTO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. AND THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN- AT PRIVATE ACTORS AND A FULL PUBLIC ENTITIES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT S. AS AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN OVERSIGHT OF CHARTER SCHOOL CLOSURES SPECIFICALLY. AND AT PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AT THAT OUR TAX BASS BINS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS REMAIN ACCESSIBLE TO FUTURE GENERATIONS OF PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS. AT THAT THAT COMMITTEE AT MOVES AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS BONTA FOR YOUR CLOSER WITH THAT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM ONE AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. DONALD HI DONALD I DALLI. DALLI KNOW BENNETT. BENNETT I CHEN LEAVE MCCARTY. MCCARTY II QUIRK-SILVA. ISRAEL ALSO IT IS ON CALL THANK YOU FOR THAT WERE GONNA GO TO MR CHENEY HAD A PREVIOUS ARRANGEMENT ARE MISTER GARCIA IS NEXT I KNOW HE'S SITTING OUT THERE. JOHNNY THE BIT TO GET UP HERE- BUT MR TANG GO AHEAD YOU MISTER TEAM HAS- A. B. C. R. OF OUR FILE ITEM SEVEN EIGHTY NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT. AB NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY HISTORIC BILL HE'S GOING TO PRESENT HERE YOU DON'T HEAR BILLS LIKE THIS EVERY DAY THE STATE LEGISLATOR SO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS BILL. AS BILL IS A BIG DEAL IT. MAY BE MUCH GREATER BY YOUR COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH WERE HAPPY TO TAKE SO. WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR HELP ON THE BILL- THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WAS PASSED IN PUT IN PLACE MY VERY FIRST YEAR LEGISLATURE. IT'S WHY TIME THAT WE REFORM IT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT IT. ESPECIALLY WITH THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN OUR STATE BUDGET AND OF COURSE THE ALLOCATION FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT. SO THIS BILL DOES A COUPLE THINGS ONE IT ADDS HOMELESSNESS AS A CATEGORY. TO OUR L. SUPER FORMULA. SO PEOPLE STILL. NOW CAN. TOWARD THIS CLUB IS THE UP WITH ARE HOMELESS TO SOMEBODY'S WERE HOME DISTRICTS HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY TAKE CARE OF THEM THEY NEED TO BE SOURCES TO GO DO THAT- OUR POVERTY LEVEL IS WAY TOO LOW WE LOOK AT OF A THRESHOLD OF TWO HUNDRED AND 50% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WE'RE MOVING OUR POVERTY LEVEL UP TO THE CAL POLY LEVEL WHICH WOULD ENCOMPASS MORE. CALIFORNIANS MOST IMPORTANTLY WE KNOW THAT EVERY DISTRICTS NEEDS MONEY ACROSS THE BOARD WE ARE WE ARE PUSHING FOR A BASE INCREASE ARE OFF THE BOARD EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT A 15% AS OF THE YEAR SUBURBAN- THE ROOM. EVERY YOU GET FIFTEEN INCREASE. DISPLACING HE LAST WEEK. WE ARE AGREEING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN CREATING A THREE YEAR RUNNING AVERAGE FOR EIGHTY EIGHT FUNDING SO. MOVING AWAY FROM THE HOLD HARMLESS BUT THIS ALLOWS A SOFTER LANDING. FOR DISTRICTS. VERY CUTE SO MAKE SURE THE DISTRICTS WITH A HIGH POPULATION OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS POPULATION OF HOMELESS STUDENTS WILL REALLY. BE GIVEN THE SUPPORT THEY NEED BUT IN PARTICULAR THIS IS A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT IN OUR STATE NEEDS HELP AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET THAT FIFTEEN PERCENT. WHICH THEY'VE BEEN ASKING FOR. AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL ON A. B. NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT WE HAVE JENNIFER BAKER HERE- KALISTO SCALLOP WAS THE- WHAT. PRESS THAT BUTTON THERE.

SEEING OPPOSITION WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THERE'S NO OPPOSITION THIS BILL BECAUSE THIS IS A GREAT BILL. EVERY SAVE A LOT- BUT 15% TO THE BASE IS BEYOND HISTORIC BEYOND HISTORIC AND THAT CAN TAKE CARE OF WRITING NEEDS IN OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA- I OFTEN TALK ABOUT CLASS SIZE RIGHT. A SUB OVER THE FALL IN THE CLASSROOM AND THE MAGIC THAT HAPPENS IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM THERE'S ONLY TWENTY FOUR KIDS VERSUS THERE. IS BIG RIDE IT CHANGES THE TONE OF THE SCHOOL DAY WHEN CLASSROOM THE COMPETITIONS A LITTLE BIT LASSEN. IS JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE PLEASANT FOR BRADY REASONS RIGHT WITH OUR LOVELY MIDDLE SCHOOLERS BUT THIS CAN HELP LOWER CLASS SIZES IT CAN HELP. ADDS CALPERS TO A SCHOOL. THIS IS A BIG BIG DEAL THIS FIFTEEN PERCENT. YOU'RE DECLINING ENROLLMENT PROPOSAL WHICH REALLY CREATES A SLOPE. AS CALIPH AS THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION GOES DOWN THE SCHOOL AGE POPULATION GOES DOWN. WE WERE FACING A CLIFF. WE'RE DISTRICTS SUDDENLY WHATEVER DROP WHERE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE. DAHLE AND THIS CREATES A SLOPE. THIS CREATES A SLOPE- SO THIS IS A HUGE BILL. IT'S MONSTROUS IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPACTFUL. FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. SO I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR WORKING WITH ME WITH US. ON ON THIS BILL. AND I THINK IT IT SPEAKS VOLUMES TO WHAT NEEDED YOU KNOW THE MONEY IS THERE AND A LOT OF YEARS THE MONEY IS NOT THERE. THIS YEAR THE MONEY IS THERE AND IT NEEDS TO GO. TO THE CLASSROOM. CLR EFFORTS AROUND THE CAPITOL DRIVE IT AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM. THIS MONEY NEEDS TO GO INTO THE CLASSROOM. NOT ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT IT'S ABOUT WHAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. NEED A SORT. THANK YOU NOT. RETAIN UP I'M- A- AT FIFTEEN TIMES PROBABLY FIFTEEN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT WITH THAT MISS BENNETT I CERTAINLY DO APPRECIATE THE WHO STARK SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS FOR YOU MISTER KING- NUMBER ONE OF. THE POVERTY LINE. IN MY NOTES REFER TO A SIXTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THAT POVERTY LINE'S GOING TO BE CONSTANTLY ADJUSTED IS IT GOING TO STAY WITH A- WITH A WITH A CAL. DEFINITION AS WELL MAKE SURE THERE IS THERE IS SOME KIND OF- I MISSPOKE SO HE'S OUT SO INSTEAD OF GOING FROM THE FEDERAL SCHOOLS MEAL THRESHOLD. YOUR NUMBERS RIGHT WE ARE DOING. A CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY LEVEL WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED AND 50% OF FEDERAL POVERTY WHICH IS ABOUT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND FOR FAMILY PORTRAITS BUT AND THAT WILL CONSTANTLY ADJUST AS TO. THAT STEVE AS A FORM YES GREAT I CHECK IT OUT SECOND ISSUE JUST AFTER WORKING IN SCHOOLS FOR A LONG TIME. THE DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS. IS- IN IN THIS POPULATION. IS TRANSIENT AND- I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT. THE THIS IS A SENSE OF UNFAIRNESS THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL. WILL POTENTIALLY HAVE IF THEY FEEL LIKE SOME SCHOOL. AS SOON AS THEY FIND OUT SOMEBODY'S HOMELESS THEY KEEP THEM IN THAT CATEGORY FOR THE NEXT. FOUR FIVE YEARS WITHOUT RECHECKING- CAN YOU HELP ME WITH. WHAT ARE THE SAFEGUARDS TO A AND WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF HOMELESS. AND WHETHER SAFEGUARDS TO MAKE SURE THE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ALL. HANDLING IT FAIRLY SO THAT NO ONE DISTRICT IS. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OTHERS NO I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO- THE DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS MATCHES ARE THE FEDERAL DEFINITION IF YOU'VE A BETTER DEFINITION WERE ALL YEARS HAPPY TO. HAPPY TO GET YOUR GUIDANCE ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. THE OTHER PIECES MOST HOMELESS CHILDREN WILL BECOME FREE COMING FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES- IN ORIGINAL ITERATION BILL WAS ON DUPLICATING ALL THESE THINGS BUT SINCE THEY'RE ALL- DUPLICATED. IT'S ALMOST THERE THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR A DISTRICT. TO KEEP THAT CHILD HOMELESS- IF THEY COME FROM A LOWER INCOME FAMILY THERE WE CAN BE COUNTED IN THAT POT THERE WE CAN GET MONEY FOR THAT POT- I THINK WITH THIS WILL ADD TO A DISTRICT IS A FOR. ABOVE ALL. I REALLY DON'T THINK MUCH INCENTIVE- ANY THIS TO YOUR KEEP TOUCH OUT ALMOST THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A CONGRATULATIONS GREAT A GOOD BILL MISTER MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISS- DONALD- I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A VOICE TODAY SOME OF THE- KEEP QUITE AS MUCH AS I CAN BUT I MAY JOIN AUTHOR OF THIS BILL- THIS IS A RIGHT ON THE RIGHT POLICY I THINK THAT PATRICK. HAD A LOVE FOR THIS IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE ALLOWED MR O'DONNELL CAN WE SAVE SOME OF THAT FOR THE OTHER BILLS. IF THEY'RE GOOD. OKAY WHILE THE OTHER HALF GOOD AS THIS ONE OKAY. WELL HALF OF THE TITLE ON THERE IS MY NAME SO I'LL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF. THAT APPRECIATION BUT WE'RE WORKING ON THIS ALONG WITH YOU IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR TWO REASONS ONE. THERE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE TOO MANY STUDENTS ARE LEFT BEHIND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THIS ELSE IF THAT POLICY- ALIVE THE DISTRICTS WITH CONCENTRATIONS OF THESE CATEGORIES. ARE STILL LEFT BEHIND STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING AND SOME WOULD SAY WHY DON'T GET. MY SHARE OVER HERE FROM THE WEALTHY OUR COMMUNITY AND- THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE SAID WE DON'T HAVE THEIR CHALLENGES. YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO TAKE THEIR CHALLENGES. AND THEN THEN GO AHEAD AND DO THAT AND EVEN WITH ALL THE SOURCES- STUDENTS ARE STILL. LEFT BEHIND AND SO I THINK CHANGING THE DATE. GORIES MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THEN ALSO AS YOU NOTED- THIS FOCUSES ON THE BAYSIDE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT WITH INFLATION. MANDATORY COSTS AND PURRS AND STIRS COSTS THAT REALLY THE INCREASES NORTH OF WE HAVE IN THERE ARE COLLAPSE. THAT'S HOW WE SEE CHALLENGES. FACING OUR EMPLOYEES OUR EDUCATORS LIVING WAGES THAT'S WHY WE SEE- STRIVE ALONG- THROUGHOUT DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA CLEAN MINE RIGHT HERE IN MY HOMETOWN- SO THIS. FOCUSES ON PUTTING RESOURCES TO. OTHER BASE AND WE WILL DO ALL THAT WE CAN IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO MIRROR. THIS POLICY BUT THIS PUTS IT. SHE GOT BORED SO THANK YOU. THANK GOD I JUST WANT TO KNOW MISTER MCCARTY HARD WORK ON THE BUDGETS UP TO ON THIS VERY TOPIC AS WELL AND I WANT TO PUSH. IT ALL HE DOES IS THERE ANY.

SOMETIMES YOU YOU KNOW THIS- WE HEAR FROM MR GALLAGHER AS WELL IF SOME THE COMMUNITIES ARE KIND OF RIGHT IN BETWEEN THERE ON THE BUBBLE I THINK THIS WILL. BRING ALL THOSE COMMUNITIES KIND OF INTO THE PROPERLY CATEGORIZED THE STRUGGLE THAT THERE HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT TO ALSO KNOW THE HARDWORKING MISTER MURATSUCHI. ON THIS EFFORT. AND HE HAS BROUGHT TO BE A CONCERN WITH A THREE YEAR- ROLLING AVERAGE SHOULD APPLY. TO THIS YEAR GIVEN THE ADA. ATTENDANCE NOT NECESSARILY ENROLLMENT WAS DOWN DURING PARTS OF THE YEAR AND THAT IS GOAL TO REALLY GOING. TO SCHOOL FINANCES AND THAT'S A CONVERSATION WILL HAVE GOING FORWARD. SO WITH THAT I JUST I AGAIN WANT TO COMMENT HOW IMPORTANT. AND HISTORIC THIS IS. AND THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR CALIFORNIA'S KIDS AND ACTUALLY A GOOD THING FOR CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. WITH THE LARGEST CLASS SIZES IN THE NATION. YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. LAWYER CLASS SIZES TEACHER MENTAL HEALTH. LOWER CLASS SIZES WHAT NEW TEACHERS IN THE DOOR WANT TO KEEP THEM. ASSIZES ONCE STUDENTS MORE COUNSELORS IN A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS THAT THIS- THIS FIFTEEN PERCENT. COULD SUPPORT AT THE SCHOOL SITE IN THE CLASSROOM SO THANK YOU MISTER TÍNH YOU MAY CLOSE- WE WHAT WE KNOW THAT THE THIS IS YOUR LAST TERM YOU CAN BE RETURNING TO THE CLASSROOM. SO WE HOPE THAT WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THE CLASSROOM YOU'RE GONNA SEE THAT CLASS SIZE REDUCTION YOU CAN SEE THOSE RESOURCES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS BILL- WE THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME. LIKE YOU SAID. TO MAKES IT GETS TO BATHROOM WITHOUT RESPECT RUSSIA RIGHT AND WHAT WE'RE TALK ABOUT ONGOING MONEY IS ONE TIME MONEY BOB YOU THINK YOU CAN EMBED THAT INTO ONGOING EXPENSES NOT A ONE TIME MONEY ONE TIME EXPENSE IS ONGOING MONEY WILL BE BACK SO WE CAN COUNT ON IT WE CAN SCORED A NINETY EIGHT WITH THAT- MISTER.

YOU KNOW SET. THE IPAD CONVERSATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO MIGHT SHOW UP IN A HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY CLASS BEING EXPECTED WITH OPPOSITION AND TO YES THE SUIT ON A FRIDAY AND YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE HOW WELL THAT WENT. IT'S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM. AND THAT THE IS WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT OF WHAT WE FIND APPEALING ABOUT ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA'S BILL IS THAT IT'S FOCUSED ON LOCAL DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL SOLUTIONS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE ISSUES THAT ARE FACING TEMECULA AND MURRIETA IN THE SOUTH PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OF OUR DESK DISTRICTS LIKE. HE TO. TIME TO. LAW S. AND DEVELOP. PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THOSE LOCAL ISSUES WE FIND VERY APPEALING.

MISTER GIBSON YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU ALLOW ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO ECSTATIC A SCHOOL SAFETY PILOT PROGRAM AND AGAIN I WANT TO UNDERSCORE A SCHOOL SAFETY PILOT PROGRAM AND DESIGNATE A TRAINED. ON DE ESCALATION SPECIALISTS TO RESPOND TO THE STUDENTS DISRUPTION BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF OF WITH THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL I WILL BE RESPECTFULLY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS DISCUSSED IN OUTLINED IN THIS BILL. THE DE ESCALATION SPECIALISTS DESCRIBED IN THIS BILL WOULD BE A STAFF MEMBER WHO DOES NOT CARRY A WEAPON. BUT ARE SKILLED IN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE CONFLICT RESOLUTENESS ALEUTIAN AND OTHER TECHNIQUES- THAT MAY BE USED TO RE DIRECT STUDENTS WHEN THERE IS A CONFLICT THAT MAY ARISE NOW MORE THAN EVER OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE EYEING TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS RECENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DATA SHOWS THAT A REFERRALS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SCHOOL RELATED ARRESTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT STUDENTS OF COLOR AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES STUDENTS HAVE ALSO SHOWN THE DE ESCALATION STRATEGIES. USING DOES NOT PREVENT A CURRENT CRISIS BUT OVER TIME CAN HELP PREVENT- INTENTIONAL BEHAVIOR THAT MAY SPILL INTO SOME KIND OF CONFLICT IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE ESCALATION- THAT EXISTS AMONG FIGHTS AND CONFLICTS BUT EXT OUT OF SYNC A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH STUDENTS ON CAMPUS ABSOLUTELY VITALLY IMPORTANT. TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEAL. WE HAVE SEEN EARLY SUCCESS WITH CAMPUSES- THAT INCLUDE THE ESCALATION SPECIALIST AND OTHER CONFLICT RESOLUTION STRATEGIES. BUT WE HAVE BUT WE WANT TO GIVE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT OPTIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVES AS A IMPORTANT AND VITAL ROLE AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE. THEIR ROLE IS VERY VITAL AND IMPORTANT KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS SAFE AND SECURE HOWEVER. WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING STUDENTS DURING A CRISIS THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE A PROACTIVE APPROACH THAT MITIGATES THESE CRISIS ADDRESS DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS BEHAVIOR AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HELP CREATES A HIGH LEARNING ENVIRONMENT POSSIBLE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THIS BILL WOULD NOT. REPLACE THE ESCALATION- SPECIALLY OFFICERS HOWEVER THIS IS A THOUGHTFUL MEASURE- THAT WE BELIEVE BECAUSE THAT IT HAS BEEN TRIED BEFORE THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY IN HELPING SOME OF THE ISSUES ON OUR CAMPUS- WITH ME TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL- IS- BROOKLEY WILLIAMS THE SENIOR ADVISER. FOR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TO TONY THURMOND. I THINK IT'S IT WOULD OF. HERE NOW ARE AT ODDS. A GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MURS I'M BERKELEY WILLIAM SENIOR ADVISER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT- CATION AND I'M TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND WHO IS THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND CONFLICTS THESE ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM FOR OUR SCHOOLS. OVER JUST THE PAST FEW MONTHS I'VE SEEN BROUGHT. AMONG SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT STUDENTS A SHOOTING INVOLVING ELK GROVE UNIFIED STUDENTS IN A FIGHT AT A HIGH SCHOOL IN RICHMOND THAT LED TO GUNFIRE. THE BILL SETS THE FOUNDATION FOR DE ESCALATION MODEL THAT WILL GIVE SCHOOLS THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO DEFUSE BROWN SITUATIONS BEFORE THEY GET OUT OF CONTROL. WE CAN TAKE PCS AS THE POLICE CAMPUSES IS NOT WORK INSTEAD WE NEED ADULTS TRAINED IN THE TYPE OF THE ESCALATION METHODS. THAT AVOID EXPOSING CHILDREN TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AT A CONSISTENTLY SHOW BUT STILL RFERRAL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SCHOOL RELATED ARRESTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. IN FACT THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS. SHOWS THAT WERE 25% OF SCHOOL ARRESTS ARE OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THE SUPERINTENDENT LIKE TO BE FOR THIS BILL IS ONLY A START. IN ORDER FOR DE ESCALATION PROGRAMS TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG RUN WE WILL NEED TO GIVE SCHOOLS OPTIONS TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR THIS PURPOSE NOT JUST TO RETAIN AND RETRAIN EXISTING EMPLOYEES. TEACHERS AND STAFF ARE ALREADY OVERWHELMED HAVING TAKEN ON ADDITIONAL ROLES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND MOST ARE STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT. FURTHER NOT ALL EXISTING STAFF ARE WELL SUITED TO LEARNING ENGAGING THESE DE ESCALATE DE ESCALATION METHODS. WE BELIEVE IN ORDER FOR THESE TYPES OF THE ESCALATION PROGRAMS TO MAKE A LASTING IMPACT WE SHOULD BE TAKING PRESSURE OFF OF EXISTING STAFF. AND EMPOWERING SCHOOLS TO HIRE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE ALREADY TURNED IN THE ESCALATION METHODS. THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA WE SEE. ASSESSES RISK TO IT YES STRATEGIES THIS IS A WAY TO X. THIS. ACROSS OUR GREAT STATE. IT IS MY SINCERE BELIEF THAT IF WE CAN EXPAND THE ESCALATION STRATEGIES IN OUR SCHOOLS. THAT IT WILL IMPROVE SCHOOL CLIMATE BY EMPOWERING STAFF TO DEFUSE CONFLICTS AGAIN BEFORE IT ERUPTS INTO VIOLENCE. WHILE ALSO INTRODUCING STUDENTS TO WAYS THEY CAN RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES WITHOUT TURNING TO VIOLENCE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SAYS FUND THIS BILL TODAY. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. THIRTY OTHER PUBLIC IN SUPPORT. A. ANY OPPOSITION. MISTER GIBSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS GETTING FIRST CENTERS AND THE HEALTH CHALLENGES FACING STUDENTS. I WOULD LIKE TO QUICKLY SHARE THREE ASPECTS. THAT MAKE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS SO EFFECTIVE PARTICULARLY FOR THIS MOMENT. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS DELIVER COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE INCLUDING BEHAVIOR HEALTH. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDE HER TEAM BASED HEALTH CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WORKING TOGETHER. SOMETIMES EVEN DENTAL AND VISION HELPING STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS RECOVER FROM THE COBIT PANDEMIC THERE PROVIDING COVER TESTING AND VACCINATIONS AND HELPING STUDENTS CATCH UP ON ON MATT AND EXACERBATED HEALTH NEEDS DURING THE PANDEMIC. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE A LOT AND WITH COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ON SUPPORTING SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS INVESTMENT. IT FOCUSES ON FACILITY COSTS FOR NEW SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS AND EXPANSION FOR EXISTING SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. I PASSING AB NINETEEN FORTY WE CAN MAKE SURE THE GRANT PROGRAM ALREADY IN STATUTE IS UP TO DATE AND BETTER MEET THE CURRENT NEEDS OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION ASK YOUR AYE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN FORTY. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS. YES REALLY QUICKLY THANK YOU AFTERNOON CHEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS LISA EISENBERG AND I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PLAN. I WOULD LIKE TO. CLARIFY SOME OF THE POINTS RAISED BY OUR POINT OPPONENTS IN YESTERDAY'S ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. FIRST NO SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS THAT. PROVIDE MEDICATION ASSISTED OR SURGICAL ABORTIONS. SECOND THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES MENTIONED AND THE STATUTE SECTION IS NOT CODE FOR ABORTION- THE TYPES OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. THAT ARE PROVIDED IN SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE AGE APPROPRIATE. I'M SERVICES LIKE TESTING AND TREATMENT FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. DISPENSING AND PRESCRIBING CONTRACEPTION AND PROVIDING INFO ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. I'M AND THEN FINALLY. NOT ALL SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDE THESE TYPES OF SERVICE. AND AB NINETEEN FORTY DOESN'T EVEN MANDATE THAT THEY DO. DELIVERING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICE. THROUGH CLINICS AND SCHOOLS CAN BE CONTENTIOUS WE RECOGNIZE THIS WITH LOTS OF REGIONAL VARIATION. I'M THAT'S WHY LOCAL SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL LEADERS HAVE OF. WEALTH OVER. HIS HEAD AND- HEALTH. IN FACT ONE OF THEM. MY SCHOOL BE CENTER SO. MANY DIFFERENT IS THAT THEY WERE THE LOCAL NEED OF THAT AND A DAY THEIR SERVE AS NEEDED THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I ARE DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING WHAT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS DO AND DON'T DO THANK YOU FOR THAT. OTHERS IN PART. CHAIR MEMBERS HAS SUBPOENAED I MEET IS NOT FINNA BEHALF OF CHILDREN NOW IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. AT ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL HAS ANY OPPOSITION YOU MAY COME FORWARD. SEEN OPPOSITION BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WISH TO COMMENT WE HAVE A MOTION. THIS MCCARTY MOVES- MISTER O'DONNELL SECONDS. ARE YOU MAY CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU MISTER. FILE ITEM SIX AB NINETEEN FORTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL I DON'T KNOW I'D DALLY DALLY NO SENATE. VENETI CHEN.

WITH YOUR AVAILABLE IF WE DO HURDLE TO OVERCOME. THIS TO. THAT. IT'S ODD THIS WEBER COME FORWARD WE'RE GONNA WILL WILL NOT TAKE ALL THREE OF YOUR BILLS OTHERS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT NOW. AND YOU'RE GONNA START WITH FIVE NINE EIGHT. FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN. ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS. I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF FOR ALL OF ITS WORK AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWO FIVE NINE EIGHT. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO CREATE AN ADVISORY BOARD TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICE MODELS OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ON THE CDC WEBSITE. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE EMPATHISE REPAIRING THE HARM DONE TO PEOPLE AND RELATIONSHIPS RATHER THAN SOLELY FOCUSING ON PUNISHING THE OFFENDERS. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE HAS ITS ROOTS IN ANCIENT AND INDIGENOUS PRACTICES EMPLOYED IN CULTURES ALL OVER THE WORLD. A STUDY DONE BY DOCTOR JANET ROSENBAUM FROM DOWNSTATE SCIENCE UNIVERSITY. ALLEN THAT ALTHOUGH REMOVING THE STUDENT FROM THE CLASSROOM HELP THE IMMEDIATE CLASS CLIMATE THE STUDENT WHO WAS PUNISHED WAS MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. HAVE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM USE MARIJUANA TOBACCO AND BE ARRESTED DURING THE SUSPENSION AND WITHIN THE YEAR OF SUSPENSION. LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH SHOW THAT SUSPENDED STUDENTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO EARN THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE AND PURSUE A DEGREE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. YOUTH AND PARTICULARLY MINORITY YOUTH WHEN EXPOSED TO THE TRADITIONAL JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM I'M MORE LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN THE ADULT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BLACK MEN IN CALIFORNIA ARE FIVE POINT FIVE TIMES OVER REPRESENTED COMPARED TO THAT POPULATION AND LATINOS ARE TWO POINT NINE TIMES OVER REPRESENTED. IT IS CLEAR THAT CURRENT METHODS OF PROPERLY ADDRESSING YOUTH OFFENSES HAVE NOT PRODUCE THE RESULTS INTENDED AND HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED YOUTH OF COLOR. PLACING THEM ON THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AS A MOM OF TWO BOYS IT IS HEARTENING TO SEE THAT BOYS WHO ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 51% OF ENROLLMENT RECEIVE ALMOST 70% OF IN SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS. AND SUSPENSIONS. ADDITIONALLY IT IS TROUBLING THAT ABOUT 31% OF BLACK STUDENTS RECEIVED ONE OR MORE IN SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS AND SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS IN CALIFORNIA PERSONAL STORY. THAT BY MY BOYS HAVING TO VERY EDUCATED PARENTS AND A GRANDMOTHER WHO IS FAIRLY WELL KNOWN. THEY HAVE ALSO RECEIVED HARSHER DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL WHEN COMPARED TO THEIR COUNTERPARTS FOR THE SAME ACTION CULTURES AND ETHNICITIES BUT ALSO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO RECEIVE MORE IN SCHOOL AND OUT OF SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS. THIRTY FIVE FOUND RETORT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES TO BE BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY IMPROVE STUDENT BEHAVIOR SUCH AS DECREASES AND FIGHTING AND PULLING. BUT ALSO WOULD DECREASE AN OFFICE REFERRALS CLASSROOM REMOVALS SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS. THAT IS ALSO SUGGEST A LINK BETWEEN RESTORATIVE APPROACHES AND IMPROVE SCHOOL CLIMATE OUTCOMES INCLUDING INCREASED LEVELS OF STUDENT CONNECTEDNESS. PROVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TEN TEACHERS AND IMPROVED MISPERCEPTIONS OF SCHOOL CLIMATE WOULD GIVE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO BEGIN THE USE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BEST PRACTICE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SUSPENSION EXPULSION OR ARREST. IT REQUIRE THE CDP TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A STANDARD MODEL TO IMPLEMENT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BEST PRACTICES ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS AND MAKE THE STANDARD MODEL AVAILABLE ON THE CD'S INTERNET WEBSITE FOR USE BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IMPLEMENT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES AS A PART. OF THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE CAMPUS CULTURE AND CLIMATE. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AND TALKING PEACE AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER AND OTHERS. HERE TO SPEAK WITH ME TODAY THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS DR PAUL COUGH COLD. AND DOCTOR WATSON A SCHOLAR ACTIVIST FACULTY DIRECTOR AND PROFESSOR OF EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND RACIAL JUSTICE AND THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AT SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THANK YOU THANK YOU TEAR TWO WITNESSES- TWO MINUTES EACH POLICE YOU MAY PROCEED. IN THE SUN WE'RE GOOD ALL RIGHT MY NAME IS DR VISOR WATSON I'M THE FACULTY DIRECTOR. AND AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP AT SAC STATE I'M A FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER RECEIVED MY DOCTORATE ADMINISTRATION PLANNING AND SOCIAL POLICY FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY. OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS MY RESEARCH IS FOCUSED. ON COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS TO THE PUNISHMENT CRISIS IN SCHOOLS AS SCHOLARS WHO STUDY DISCIPLINE POLICY YOU KNOW. THAT WE CAN SUSPEND OUR WAY TO SAFER SCHOOLS DEVELOPING A HEALTHY CLIMATE AND CULTURE CANNOT BE FORCED HOWEVER IT CAN BE CULTIVATED. HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW WE'RE SORT OF THE CENTER'S DIALOGUE AND MEDIATION IS PRIMARILY ON COMPASSION AND HEALING. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS COLLECTIVE AND INVOLVES MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS RELATIONAL RESPECTFUL AND RESPONSIBLE. NOW WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL DID YOU ATTEND AND WHICH KIND OF SCHOOLS YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN TO GROW UP INSIDE. A SCHOOL THAT'S FILLED WITH RIGOR AND JOY OR RIDICULE AN INJURY OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS CHOSEN THE LATTER HOW DID WE GET HERE. IN THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO THOUSAND THE POLICE PRESENCE ON PUBLIC SCHOOL CAMPUSES INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY. UNDER ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES SINCE THEN SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS. HAVE BECOME THE MOST RAPIDLY GROWING SEGMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE INTENTION OF THESE POLICIES WAS TO MAKE SCHOOLS SAFER FOR OUR CHILDREN THE DATA SHOWS THAT GOAL WAS NOT EVEN ACCOMPLISHED. REMOVING POLICE IS JUST ONE STEP BUT THE REALLOCATION OF THE FUNDS ONCE USED TO PAY FOR THEM UP. INTO RESTORED OF RESOURCES IS CRITICAL AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY EIGHT IS ESSENTIAL LEGISLATION OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TAKING IMPORTANT STEPS TO DEFINE THE POLICE. WITHIN THE LA- AND- THOSE RESOURCES NEED TO BE RE ALLOCATED TO RESTORATIVE PRACTICES OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT MELTED DOWN THEIR GUNS AND DECOMMISSION THEIR PATROL VEHICLES THEY USE THE SAME FUNDS THEY WERE ONCE USED FOR THE OVER POLICING OF CHILDREN OF COLOR AND CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES TO TRAIN AND HIRE RESTORATIVE CULTURE AND CLASS. WE MAKES SCHOOLS THIS IS HOW WE DEVELOP HEALTHIER LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS PLEASE SOME RISE. UP CLOSE WITH THIS IN EAST AFRICA TRADITIONAL READING PASSED AMONG THE MASAI WARRIORS IS HOW IS THE CHILDREN. THESE LEGENDARY FIGHTERS IN KENYA WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN GIVE THE SAME CALMING ANSWER. ALL THE CHILDREN ARE WELL THIS SIMPLE STATEMENT PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO A CULTURAL TRADITION. THE PRIORITIZE A KID NEEDS OF THE YOUNG I HOPE CALIFORNIA DOES THE SAME THANK YOU THANK YOUR NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU JERRY DONNELLAN WILL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SURE SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY EIGHT FOR YOUR ON GOING SUPPORT OF PUBLIC ADD. YOUR LEADERSHIP DURING THESE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES THE FORMER COURT SCHOOL TEACHER FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THE EARLY NINETIES I HAD THE HONOR OF WORKING WITH SPELLED INCARCERATED YOUTH. EIGHT TWENTY FIVE NINETY EIGHT WOULD ASSIST SCHOOL OFFICIALS TO RETHINK HOW WHICH THEIR CHILDREN PARTICULARLY THOSE IN NEED PRIOR TO THE LOCKDOWN. ONLY 53% OF ELEVENTH GRADERS REPORTED THEY HAD A CONNECTION TO SCHOOL IN ONLY SIXTY TWO PERCEPTIVE A LONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR SCHOOL. NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. THAT LEAD TO THOSE BEHAVIORS THE DEPARTURE FROM MANY TRADITIONAL PRACTICES THAT POSH THE SYMPTOM WITHOUT REGARD TO THE Y. IN OUR EXPERIENCE VAST MAJORITY DISCIPLINARY ISSUES I'M MORE A CRY FOR HELP FROM THE STUDENT RATHER THAN A REFLECTION OF THE CHILD REALLY IS. STARTED PRACTICES CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAMILY STUDENTS SCHOOL OFFICIALS TO WORK TOGETHER IN A MUCH DIFFERENT CAUGHT THE PROMOTES DIALOGUE IN DEEPENING RELATIONSHIPS. OUR EXPERIENCE IS WHEN A STUDENT FEELS EMPOWERED AND IN CONTROL OF HIS OR HER OWN AGENCY ILLNESS AND EVIDENTLY CHANGED NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS. AS A DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT FULLY COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS TO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE CENTER STAFFED WITH CERTIFICATED TEACHER. TO MENTAL HEALTH THERE. STUDENT NEEDED TO BE REMOVED FROM A CLASS I CAN. THEY WERE. TO THE SENATE WITH. THE MENTAL HEALTH INTAKE IN ORDER TO FIND OUT IF THERE WERE OTHER ISSUES. TO BE AWARE OF TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT TO THE STUDENT FAMILY. IN ADDITION. ACADEMIC WORK FROM THE CLASS CAME WITH THEM AND THEY RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM THE TEACHER RICHARD AND THEY WOULD NOT FALL BEHIND ACADEMICALLY. FINALLY NATIONAL EFFORTS BROUGHT EDUCATORS AND FAMILIES TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH. HOW THEY WOULD MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER FROM THAT POINT ON. NONE OF THIS WAS DICTATED TO ANYONE THE AGREEMENTS WERE UNANIMOUS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. STUDENTS WERE NOT SAID HOME IN THE COURSE OF THE SEVEN YEARS. OUR DISTRICT WENT FROM A 58% GRADUATION RATE TO OVER 93% WELL SUSPENSIONS DECREASED 18% TO UNDER TWO PERCENT. AT THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WE'VE BILL TO RESTORE PRACTICES TEAM OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS. PARTNERED WITH THE NATIONAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION CENTER TO SUPPORTER DISTRICTS AND OF TRAINED OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND SCHOOL OFFICIALS. BOTH CERTIFICATED AND CLASSIFIED IN THIS APPROACH.

PERFORMING SUBGROUP. CALIFORNIA IS A STATE THAT VALUES EDUCATION. WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST SCHOOLS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD. AND YET WE HAVE A SUB GROUP OF OUR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN CHRONICALLY LEFT BEHIND ACADEMICALLY. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS FROM THIS COMMITTEE THIS ACADEMIC GAP HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR DECADES. THE MOST RECENT DATA BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SHOWS THAT IN 201967% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS DON'T READ OR WRITE AT GRADE LEVEL AND MORE THAN SEVENTY NINE PERCENT. ARE BELOW GRADE LEVEL IN MATH. JUST LET THOSE NUMBERS SINK IN. THIS MEANS THAT ONLY 33% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE PROFICIENT IN READING AND ONLY 21% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE PERCENT PROFICIENT IN MATH. THAT MEANS WE ARE KILLING THESE CHILDREN. 33% AND 21% ON ANY EXAM IS AN AFT. THIS IS AN ODD THING THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN ESPECIALLY IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT HAS SO MANY RESOURCES. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF A STRONG ACADEMIC FOUNDATION AND THAT EDUCATION IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER. THE FOUNDATION THAT WE ARE CREATING FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IS BROKEN AND AN EQUAL. WE SHOULD PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO THOSE THAT NEED IT THE MOST. AND THAT WAS THE REASON BEHIND CREATING L. C. F. F. TO PROVIDE FOR EQUITABLE FUNDING AMONG LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO ADDRESS ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. AND YET IN MANY OF OUR LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP ARE AN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM L. C. F. F. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BELONG TO ONE OF THE CURRENT SUB GROUPS THAT RECEIVED EXTRA FUNDING. AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL CORRECT THIS BY CREATING A NEW SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. FOR THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP AND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. JOINING US HERE TODAY WE HAVE THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL DR MARGARET FORTUNE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF REX AND MARJORIE FOURTEEN SCHOOL OF EDUCATION I'M BROOKLYN WILLIAMS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF EDUCATION. YOU MAY PERCEIVE IN REDDING. AB YOU KNOW YOUR MICROPHONE IS HONESTLY THAT MIKE BUT RIGHT THANK YOU DR WEBER MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR MARGARET FORTUNE I'M THE PRESIDENT OF FOURTEEN SCHOOL OF EDUCATION THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FOUR. CO SPONSORS ARE ONLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND DOUBLE ACP STATE CONFERENCE AND DOUBLE ACP SAMBAR TO DINO NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK WESTERN REGION AND SACRAMENTO CHAPTER. INTERNATIONAL FAITH BASED COALITION ALSO COMMUNITY EDUCATION INITIATIVE NATIONAL COALITION OF A HUNDRED BLACK WOMEN SET OF AND STATE SUPER REPUBLICAN STRUCTURE IN TONY THURMOND I'M HERE TODAY TO THE FLAW IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IN AN EFFORT TO TARGET RESOURCES TO THE HIGHEST NEEDS STUDENTS IN THE STATE. AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FOUR CREATES A NEW SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT FOR THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP OF STUDENTS NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING SUPPLEMENTAL STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDING. BLACK STUDENTS BLACK STUDENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF INCOME ARE PERFORMING BELOW THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE IN BOTH ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH 67% OF BLACK STUDENTS NOT READ OR WRITE A GREAT DEAL AND 79% DO NOT MEET MATH STANDARDS. A UC BERKELEY STUDY FOUND THAT SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS RECEIVING CONCENTRATION GRANTS DURING THE INITIAL TWO YEARS OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA DIDN'T ENGAGE IN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE THAT PARALLELS GATE IN PUPIL ACHIEVEMENT. BUT THEY ALSO NOTED THAT THEIR INABILITY TO DETECT GAINS FOR BLACK STUDENTS IS WORRISOME THESE EARLY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT WHILE L. CFS SUPPLEMENTS AB IMPROVE OUTCOME. OUTCOMES FOR SOME STUDENTS A NOTABLE GAP REMAINS FOR BLACK STUDENTS EIGHTY THOUSAND BLACK STUDENTS ARE NOT RECEIVING ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING OR ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS. UNFUNDED BLACK STUDENTS ARE THE ONLY SUBGROUP PERFORMING BELOW THE STATE WIDE AVERAGE ON E. LA IN MATH THAT IS NOT ALREADY RISK. L. C. F. F. SUPPLEMENT. A TWENTY SEVEN SEP FOUR WOULD GENERATE AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT SERVE UNFUNDED BLACK STUDENTS ALONG WITH L. CAP ACCOUNTABILITY. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FOUR AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEIR CHANCE TO TESTIFY THANK YOU. TO OUR NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M BROOKLYN WILLIAMS SENIOR ADVISER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. AND I'M TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMAN. WHO IS THE CO SPONSOR OF AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN FOUR. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS THE CO AUTHOR OF THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE. BY HER MOTHER SECRETARY OF STATE DR SHIRLEY WEBER AND WE ARE THRILLED TO SEE THE BATON PASSED. THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION PLACE IS EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL STUDENTS AT THE CENTER OF HIS AGENDA. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO COPE WITH FAMILY MEMBERS DEATHS. MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES FROM THE PANDEMIC AND THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL AND RACIAL INJUSTICE. AS WELL AS POVERTY AND SO MUCH MORE. UNFORTUNATELY THESE TRAUMAS FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. WE MUST TAKE BOLD ACTION NOW TO MEET STUDENTS NEEDS AND TO REDUCE THE LEARNING LOSS THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED. THE MORE DATA FOR YOU TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STATEWIDE TESTING DATA SHOW THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP WITH ONLY AND ONLY 33% MEETING MATH STANDARDS. THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH 51% MEETING L. E. LA AND- 1% MATH. DESPITE THIS EVER GOING TO MAKE GAP AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HIGH NEEDS UNDER L. CFS. ONE KEY WAY WE CAN HELP TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS BY CREATING A NEW SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP OF STUDENTS NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING% FUNDS. FOR CONTEXT IN THE FALL THE SUPERINTENDENT ANNOUNCED PLANS TO BUILD A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THIS GOAL HE CONVENED A TASK FORCE THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER PRACTITIONERS ADVOCATES RESEARCHERS FOUNDATION PARTNERS THOUGHT LEADERS. OTHER EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO IDENTIFY KEY STRATEGIES TO INFORM POLICY AND PRACTICE. AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN FOUR ALIGNS WITH THAT CHARGE AND IS A CRITICAL AND TIMELY INVESTMENT.

THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT TESTIMONY IT'S GREAT TO SEE ALL THEIR FACES AND- SO WE DO NEED TO TAKE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM IF THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION. WITH THANK YOU AND WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU IT LOOKS LIKE YOU LOST ALL OUR MEMBERS HERE. THAT WE HAD A LOT OF KIDS PARTICIPATE. SO I WILL I SUPPORT THIS I SUPPORT IF YEARS AGO SO I MOVED ON. CAN'T TAKE A VOTE RIGHT NOW BUT JUST- A COUPLE ISSUES I THINK THE YOU SHOULD ADDRESS ABOUT THIS ISSUE- GOING FORWARD- SO FOUR YEARS AGO WE PUT THE ALLOCATION IN THE BUDGET. THERE WAS A ONE TIME ALLOCATION AND- IT'S SOMEWHAT UNKNOWN HOW IT WORKS SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND. HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT WE'RE DOING WELL WE SOUGHT OUT TO DO- USUALLY WHEN WE ARE WORKING. I USUALLY TO IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH WE HOPE THAT SOMEWHERE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA VISION OR DOING WORK WE SOUGHT OUT TO DO IN THE STATE BUDGET. AND SO WITH THIS IN A PILOT WE HAD FOR FOUR YEARS. HOW DO WE SEE WHAT WE SOUGHT TO DO- WORKED DON'T THINK WAS A FOUR YEAR PILOT I THINK WITH THE ONE TIME BUDGET COMING OUT WHEN IN THE BUDGET ONE TIME AS AN ACTIVE PILOT BECAUSE IT WAS ONE RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. I'M AND ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH THAT IS. THE PANDEMIC HEAD. AND SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT- THOSE FUNDS REALLY MADE THE IMPACT THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR BUT- I'M SEEING THAT I AM FOR MY SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND AND I DO LIKE TO SEE DATA AND RESULTS WILL DEFINITELY BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE FUNDS ARE NOT ONLY GOING WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GOING AND DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING BUT IF THEY'RE NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO CHANGE COURSE SO THAT WE CAN START TO CLOSE. ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. YEAH I THINK. AND I AM. WE HAD OUR SUPERINTENDENT AS A- PARTNER WITH THIS. HE WAS- INVOLVED WE PUT THIS IN THE BUDGET FOR YEARS AGO. AND IF IT'S IMPORTANT THAT HE'S HIS- ART OF EDUCATION IS ENGAGE WITH THIS- BECAUSE IT IS HUNDRED OR SO AMAZING STUDENTS AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE GONNA FOLLOW THEM TO THEIR CLASSROOM THEY GO TO A SCHOOL SITE. AND NOW IT'S UP TO BE ADULTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE FOCUS ON THE RIGHT. SPOT SO- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE THAT WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN YEAH I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE WITH LCF FUNDING OVERALL- AND- AND SO WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABLE. THESE TO THE FUNDS AND I AND I THINK THAT'S JUST BEEN A CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVE JUST THROUGHOUT THE ASSEMBLY. EVENT ENDING IN GENERAL. I CAN. LIKE TO CLOSE. SO I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE SPONSORS- ALL THE SPONSORS AND ALL THOSE WHO CAME TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD TODAY I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS FOR MAKING THIS BILL A CAUCUS PRIORITY. A STATE THAT ENSURES EVERYONE IS ACADEMICALLY SUCCESS IS THE BENEFIT. SO LET'S DO WHAT'S RIGHT LET'S DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ALL OF THESE KIDS THAT SHOWED UP TODAY.MOST OF THEM FALL INTO THIS LOWEST ACHIEVING OB SUBGROUP. LET'S PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO THOSE THAT CLEARLY NEEDED. AND FINALLY CLOSE THIS ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND GIVE EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA THE FOUNDATION TO MAXIMIZE THEIR SUCCESS AND POTENTIAL IN THE FUTURE. I URGE YOUR VOTE AND I VOTE. TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM ELEVEN AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN FOR THE MOTION IS DUE PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS- O'DONNELL. I VALLEY ARE SENATE CHEN LI MCCARTY MCCARTY I QUIRK-SILVA. THOSE ON CALL HOLD OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS OF THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE WHO CAME TODAY. THANK YOU. A LOT OF. ITEM NINE. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND- MEMBERS. FINAL BILL I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN A MODEST BILL TO IMPROVE THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY AND EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE TOOL THANK YOU I'M I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND WILL BE TAKING AMENDMENTS I'M- WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE TODAY SO I'M GONNA JUST SKIP TO- OUR- PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING TESTIMONY WE HAVE CATHERINE FLORES WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA MUTATION COALITION AT SUDAN. FOREIGN DOLLARS IT'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NURSING AND WELLNESS IN SANTA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. READY A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATHERINE FLORES MARTIN AND I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA MINIMIZATION COALITION AND WE'VE WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE FOR YEARS. TO CREATE STRONG AND EFFECTIVE LAWS THE RESULT AND PROTECTING MILLIONS OF CHILDREN TEENS AND ADULTS FROM PREVENTABLE DISEASES. THIS BILL MAKE SIMPLE CHANGES AND UPDATES THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S. OR TO MAP NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH AMER. THIS BILL IS LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION TO REQUIRING THAT PROVIDERS WHO ADMINISTER VACCINES ENTER THAT DATA INTO THE REGISTRY WE'RE ASKING THAT THE EXISTING RACE AND ETHNICITY FEEL BE SELECTED AND ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT EDUCATION. IS THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ACCESS TO VIEW THE DATA ON ALL DEATHS IN WAITED TO STUDENT SAFETY. SURE EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT IS IN THE CASE OF AN OUTBREAK OF SOMETHING LIKE HEPATITIS A FOR EXAMPLE HEPATITIS A VACCINE IS GIVEN AT AROUND WHEN YOU'RE OF AGE. AND IT IS A RECOMMENDED BUT NOT RIGHT HIGHER VACCINATION FOR SCHOOL. IN THE EVENT OF A LOCAL OUTBREAK WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR SCHOOL NURSES TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THE IMMUNIZATION STATUS OF THEIR- THEIR STUDENTS. OUR NEXT PANDEMIC MAY NOT BE A NOVEL CORONAVIRUS A COULD BE A NOVEL INFLUENZA VIRUS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE IN PLACE AND READY TO ADDRESS FUTURE NEEDS. NOT FIX IT AFTERWARDS NOT FIX IT IN THE MIDDLE BE READY FOR THE FUTURE. FOR THESE UPDATES WILL HELP ENSURE GREATER EQUITY AND ACCESS TO VACCINES BY THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HARMED BY THIS PANDEMIC. FIRST AUTHORIZED. I'M SORRY THE REGISTRY WAS FIRST AUTHORIZED IN NINETEEN NINETY IT'S BEEN A LONG RUN FOR A LONG TIME AND SINCE THAT. MEANS OF DOSES AND RECORDED IN THE REGISTER. AND IT'S BECOME AN AMAZING RESOURCE FOR THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS AND FOR SCHOOLS. WERE AUTHORIZED USERS. THE DOCUMENT VACCINE MINISTRATION AND IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH OUTREACH NEEDS. FOR THE REGISTRY SYSTEM CONSOLIDATES IMMUNIZATION RECORDS FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES INTO A SINGLE RECORD. IT FORECAST WHAT IMMUNIZATIONS ARE DO IT MANAGES VACCINE INVENTORY ASSIST PROVIDERS WITH CONDUCTING REMINDER RECALL THE SEND OUT REMINDER NOTICES. AND PRODUCES A VARIETY OF PATIENT SPECIFIC AN AGGREGATE REPORTS TO BE ABLE TO JOBS. AUTHORIZED USERS POLLUTE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SCHOOL AND CHILD CARE FOR SO. THE ACCESS. CHOIR TO FIND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS AND UNDERGO REQUIRED TRAINING. THE CARE SYSTEM WAS ALREADY IN PLACE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC THIS PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHING IMPORTANT WORK TO SUPPORT HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS IN SCHOOLS. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY AND HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN USING THIS REGISTRY FOR DECADES THERE'S NO LEGITIMATE OFF OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. PROVIDERS ARE HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM AND THEY ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE SPAT THIS LEGISLATION AND WE ALSO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SUSAN BARNES- I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NURSING AND WELLNESS IT'S SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IS THE SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. WE SERVE STUDENT POPULATION OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IN A HUNDRED EIGHTY. THIS YEAH. I NEVER IT'S QUALIFY FOR A REDUCED LUNCH MEALS ADDED SCHOOL DISTRICT THE PANDEMIC HAS DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR INFORMATION TO BE EFFECTIVELY SERVE STUDENTS AND TO DO IT WITH EQUITY. SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WE COULD BE AS PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT. AND HOW THEY NEED IT. AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE FACE AND HELPING OUR MOST IMPACTED STUDENTS IS KNOWING WHO HAS ACCESS TO VACCINE AND WHO DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO VACCINES FOR US TO ASSESS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR SCHOOLS AND TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS REMAIN OPEN EVEN DURING A PANDA. AS WITH THESE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES THAT CATHERINE OUTLINED CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT- THERE WAS WAS A SCHOOL THAT WAS JUST THROUGH HERE IF JUST ONE STUDENT HAD AN OUTBREAK OF HEPATITIS EIGHT. OR WHAT. HOW TO KEEP YOUR COCKLE MENINGITIS WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK UP THE STUDENTS IN. HIGHER SCHOOLS. THE SCHOOL SO MANY TIMES WE THINK OF A CLASSROOM IT'S A LARGE BODY OF STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE TO RESEARCH REALLY FAST TO GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. ACCESS STREET DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WILL ALSO REMOVE THE BURDEN ON PARENTS. AS THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES COMMUNICATE WITH SCHOOLS WHEN THEIR CHILD HAS BEEN VACCINATED. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL SIMPLY BE ABLE TO CHECK THEIR REGISTRY ON A REGULAR BASIS TO CONFIRM A STUDENT HAS BEEN VACCINATED. THIS IS ALSO CRITICAL FOR HOMELESS AND FOSTER CARE STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT ALWAYS BE AWARE NEED TO INFORM THEIR SCHOOL ABOUT THEIR VACCINATION STATUS OR TO ACCESS VACCINE. FOR THESE REASONS DIEGO UNIFIED IS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN. AND THANKS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND AUTHORIZING THIS PROPOSAL. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU AYE VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES TODAY. OH I'M SORRY. RIGHT ANY SUPPORT IN THE ROOM. MEDICAL DEVICE CHEN MEMBERS pDENNIS QUESTO MATTER WHAT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON KELLY KING ON BEHALF OF PROTECT US IN STRONG SUPPORT PROTECT US IN STRONG SUPPORT. BRODERICK'S OF THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU GO AHEAD THANK YOU MY NAME IS CHRISTINA HELD RENDON I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE VOICE TO TRACE ADVOCACY WELL WE AGREE IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO THE CALIFORNIA MINIMIZATION REGISTRIES THE BILL DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS HONESTLY THE REGISTRIES A MASS FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT. THERE ARE. BILLS HAVING. RECORD THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THE CALIFORNIA AND MONETIZATION REGISTRIES CLAIM TO BE OPT OUT REGISTRIES BUT THEY ONLY ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR THE LOOKING AT THE DATA WITH ALL THE REMAINING DATA LEFT IN THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY MOST VACCINE PROVIDERS INPUT VACCINES INTO THE REGISTRIES DO. OVER TO OLD TO DO SO WHEN THEY DO THEY DISCLOSE THAT THEY'RE DOING SO TO THE PATIENT PARENTS GUARDIANS BUT IS VACCINATED CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO STOP THE IT A DISAGREED WELL MAY. HAPPY ONE WHERE THEY CAN GET OUT ALL THEIR VACCINE. WE'VE RECEIVED NUMEROUS CONCERNED BECAUSE IN FROM UNTUK FAMILIES AND THOSE CONCERNED FOR THE PRIVACY OF THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS NOT WANTING THEM TO BE SAVED IN A GOVERNMENT DATABASE. THESE GROUPS WOULDNOT BE VACCINATE THEM DATA AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL TO BASE TO NOTE THESE PATIENTS WOULD STILL EASY ACCESS THE VACCINE- THREE THAT POSITION. THANK FOR THE K. WHEN YOU TAKE PRIVACY QUESTION MEDICAL RECORDS VERY SERIOUSLY. YOUR COMMITTEE TO THE RED TO BE PICKED. INSTANT IS A RECORDS OR INPUT THE TIME BACKS IN A- WE APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMEND BUT AN ISSUE WITH THE SUGGESTION. CASE OF SCHOOLS LIMIT THE T. OF SCHOOLS TO DOWNLOAD THE CODE NINETEEN VACCINE INFORMATION INTO THOSE SCHOOLS WITH A POLICY MANDATING COVERT NINETEEN MAXINE'S THERE COULDN'T BE NO PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE MANDATING THE COBIT NINETEEN VACCINE AS A RESULT OF LAWSUITS AGAINST INDIA UNIFIED AND PENA BONTA I SCHOOL TO. WHERE THE JOB RULED THAT MANDATE ONLY BE DONE BY PH OR THE- IF EITHER OF THOSE ENTITIES WERE TO MANDATE THE CARPET NINETEEN VACCINES SCHOOL OR TO. HAVE ACCESS. FOR THE OTHER SCHOOL REQUIRED VACCINES MAKING THIS SECTION OF THE BILL REDUNDANT WITHOUT COULD BE NINETEEN VACCINE MANDATES IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR WHY WHICH CAO WAX AND OTHER ENTITIES LISTED IN THE BILL WE NEED ACCESS TO THE CODE NINETEEN VACCINE INFORMATION THANK. ASKING POSE A. B. SEVENTY NINETY SEVEN BUT IF YOU FEEL THE NEED TO VOTE AND MOVE THIS BILL TODAY WE ASK YOU DO SO WITH ME WITH THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. RACHEL IVERMECTIN GATES AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN BUT I DID SUPPORT. MY NAME IS VERONICA FROM THE YUBA COUNTY AND I OPPOSE SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN. SURE IN A LATCH PLASTER COUNTY IN A REPRESENT JAMES P. BRAWLEY RUNNING FOR US SENATE AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE SPELL. QUINTON AVEC ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH COALITION ADVOCACY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS RECORDING NO COMMENTS. IT'S WE HAD A MOTIONS AGAIN FOR THIS BILL. NOW. SO I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE SAY SO I CAN'T MAKE THE SECOND BUT I DO HAVE- I RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF CALLS AND EMAILS FROM CONCERNED SAID- CAN TWINS AND ONE OF THE BIG MOST I GUESS. I GUESS PERCENTAGES PROTECTING THEIR DATA THEIR CHILD'S MEDICAL INFORMATION SO I THINK TO CLARIFY FOR MYSELF I READ THROUGH THE BILL. IT IS THE INTENT SCHOOL SITE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER LOOK UP THE THEIR INFORMATION FOR THEIR SCHOOL SO OF IS EXAMPLE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED BUT IT IS THAT THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED GOING TO BE ABLE TO THEN LOOK INTO LA IN A FIVE OR A NEIGHBORING SCHOOL BUT- IS. COOL RIGHT. YEAH SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WOULD ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR OWN STUDENTS. I DON'T KNOW THAT SO THE YOUNG MAN ON TO THAT SO THE DATABASE ALREADY EXISTS. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PROVIDERS USE THE SYSTEM IT'S BEEN AUTHORIZED FOR MANY YEARS IT'S HAD NO DATA BREACHES THERE'S NOTHING TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN IT'S AS IF. WE'RE PUTTING IN THE YELLOW CARD INFORMATION THE INFORMATION ON VACCINE RECORDS THERE'S NO OTHER MEDICAL INFORMATION IN THERE THAT WOULD. THE SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY WOULD WANT TO ACCESS THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WOULD HAPPEN BUT- SO. BASIS THERE ARE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO ACCESS I GET MY TO MY SON GETS HIS VACCINATION AND FRESNO MAYBE WE MOVED TO SAN DIEGO THEY'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK THAT UP THERE ARE FIVE IS MY YELLOW CARD ALONG THE WAY SO THE CHILD DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. RE VACCINATED THE SCHOOL NURSES CAN LOOK UP THAT DATA AS WELL ON THE STUDENTS AT THEIR SCHOOL. SO YEAH IT IT'S OPEN TO PEOPLE WHO RIDE BY LAW TO UPDATE NOW WE'RE OR IS TO FIRST SCHOOLS WILL TO. BUT TECHNICALLY SCHOOLS CAN ONLY LOOK LOOK AT TECHNICALLY ON THE LOOK AT. THE REQUIRED VACCINATIONS THAT'S WERE HERE ABOUT. NOT NOT TO AND WE'RE NOT HERE TO ALLOW OF REGISTRY THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S ALLOWED THAT'S HEARING THAT THAT'S DONE. WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS ALLOWING SCHOOLS TO LOOK ALL THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT. MANY COCKLE BACK DOES NOT OFFER. SCHOOLS TECHNIQUE LOOK AT UP THEY CAN'T LOOK. HEPATITIS A RIGHT NOW THEY CAN SEE ALL THE OTHER VACCINE BUT THEY CAN'T. TECHNICALLY USE THAT DATA. TO DETERMINE HOW TO DO OUTREACH IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO THIS ISN'T ABOUT. WHETHER DISTRICTS EXIST. YES THAT'S ABOUT GIVING HER. A TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY NEED TO PREVENT DISEASE AND OUR SCHOOLS. SO- THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION DISINFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT THIS I REGISTRY SIDE I WILL HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS THAT I WAS A IGHT TALKING POINTS BUT WE DID THIS YESTERDAY. WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE SPEAKING I'M SO LIKE WAS STATED THIS IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY CAME INTO EXISTENCE. MANY YEARS AGO WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES LATE NINETEEN NINETIES. I'M IT BEGAN WITH A LOT OF MANY DIFFERENT INDEPENDENT COUNTY BASED SYSTEMS AND HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO A MORE CENTRALIZED STATE WIDE DATABASE. TODAY EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA IS A PART OF THIS SYSTEM EXCEPT SAN JOAQUIN WHO HAS ITS OWN IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY THE WERE NOT CREATING ANYTHING NEW WE'RE NOT BRINGING IN ANY BY NEW THE MAJORITY OF COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE A PART OF ITS IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY. CURRENTLY EIGHTY SIX CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE AGE OF SIX HAVE TWO OR MORE IMMUNIZATIONS ALREADY IN THIS REGISTRY. I'M EXISTING LAW ALSO ALLOWS THE IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION TO BE SHARED WITH THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY AS LONG AS THE PATIENT OR THE PARENT IS INFORMED ABOUT THAT REGISTRY IF THEY DON'T WANT IT THEY CAN ALWAYS LOCK THEIR RECORDS SO THAT IT IS NOT SHARED WITH ANY OTHER USER SO THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM CAN'T SEE IT ON AND THAT THEIR FOOD GEN IT IT IT JUST LIKE AND THEIR- ON A- CORPORATE UNIT. BUT YOUR DOCTORS DON'T WRITE IT ON PAPERS. MOST OF US DON'T. MOST OF US USE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT BUT OTHER USERS ONE THAT. THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRIES I ESTATUA SHORE STRICT CONFIDENCE. TYPICA AND A WOMAN AND TWO PER. OR TO BE A USER THE PROVIDER USER MUST SIGN A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND VIEWING OF PATIENT RECORDS ARE TRACKED AND MAINTAINED WITH AN AUDIT TRAIL. IF YOU HAPPEN TO GO INTO SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T YOU WILL BE FLAGGED. ON ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY WAS WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAS BEEN LIKE ANY BREACHES AND THE AND THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRIES SINCE IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. NOW SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THERE IT'S SAFE IT DOES NOT VIOLATE HIPPA LAWS- IF THE ONLY THING IS THAT NOT ALL PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IN A SMALL PRIVATE PRACTICE SOMEWHERE YOU MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE INPUTTING THAT INFORMATION INTO THE SYSTEM BUT IT'S TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE REALLY SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO CARRY AROUND DIGITAL CARDS THAT WERE IN EXISTENCE WHEN I WAS A AND- BECAUSE WE HAVE PASSED IT BOB THEY'RE NOT. OTHER METAL PRACTICES AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. IMMUNIZATION DATABASE IS. MODERN AND ACCURATE AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHEN INTO THE YES TO ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M I THINK THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT THE SUPPORT SIDE IS AYING WHAT THE BILL DOES AND WHAT ARE WHAT SOME PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING IS AND I THINK THE DISCONNECT THERE IS THERE A CONVERSATION BY THE SUPPORT SIDE THE THAT A DISTRICT. SORT OF DOWNLOAD OR ACCESS YOU KNOW THERE DISTRICTS DATA SO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CURRENTLY ALL THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE CARE IT. POSTED DATE THAT'S WHAT CAN DOWN. THERE SAYING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A THAT THEY WANT TO KNOW THE MAN CHOCOLATE WHATEVER IT THE I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENTS OF THE BILL FROM THIS PREMISE COMMITTEE ONLY WOULD RESTRICT IT TO COVE IT BUT I THINK THERE IS A CONNECT ON. IN FOR AND WHETHER THE JUDGE. AS TO BEING ABLE TO DOWNLOAD LARGE SWATHS OF DATA ON YOUR WHOLE SCHOOL DISTRICT AT ONCE AND THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT WE WOULD LOVE ANSWERED AS WELL. THANK YOU AND I THINK WE HAVE SOMEONE HERE THE IMITATION REGISTER. IS THE ACT EXPERT AND MOVEMENT- THE DATA IS AVAILABLE TO THE SCHOOLS NOW IN SCHOOL DISTRICT ALSO AS YOU MAY KNOW HAVE THEIR OWN DATABASES SO THIS THIS MANY TIMES THE STATE ALREADY EXISTS IN THE SCHOOL DATABASE. SO IT'S A IT'S PART OF THE STUDENTS RECORDS RIGHT NOW SUSAN CAN EXPAND ON THIS OF. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PARENT THE PARENT PRESENTS OUR CHILD FOR ENTRY INTO SCHOOLS A KINDERGARTNER NEW STUDENT CALLUM THEY PER MANY OF THE DOCK YELLOW MERGERS WILL RECORD AND THAT IS PUT IN. THE SCHOOL RECORD THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION RECORD ALONG WITH THE OTHER STUDENT DATA. EIGHT NURSES AND CAN USE TO VERIFY NEW VACCINATIONS THAT MAY NOT HAVE MADE IT ONTO THE SCHOOL DATABASE SO IT'S A SECOND TOOL I'M- THIS MEANT THAT THE OPPOSITION IS DISCUSSED SWATHS OF DATA BEING DOWNLOADED BUT IT IS USED FOR SCHOOL ENTRY FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES- DOCTORS CAN WRITE REPORT ON THEIR PATIENTS. THE STATE CAN RUN REPORTS IN PROJECT IT IS NOT CORRECT TO SAY THAT MASSES OF DOWNLOADS WILL BE OCCURRING. IT'S ONLY AS APPROPRIATE FOR SCHOOL OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AS DR WEBER SAID- THINGS ARE FLAGGED IT'S A IF IT'S NOT BEING IT'S NOT IF IT'S WITH MONITOR CLOSE. AT AT IN. STUDENTS FROM ALL OVER REGISTER FOR SCHOOLS IN SAN DIEGO AND MANY MANY TIMES THEY'VE JUST REMOVED I IN THEIR SHOP RECORD. AND SO WE NEED A DATABASE TO BE ABLE TO GO IN AND QUICKLY FIND THEIR SHOT RECORD OTHERWISE THEY CAN'T LEGALLY ENROLL FOR SCHOOL. AND THEN THEY GO HOME AND TRY TO FIND OR YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY WHO'S GOT LOSE WHAT OVER IT. YOU'VE GOT A HOMELESS OR- YOU DIDN'T. OF AN END TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN TERMS OF YEP BIG SWATHS I MEAN I CAN ONLY THINK OF WHEN WE HAVE. OUT CASES THE BIG SUAS IT'S SPECIFIC TO THE STUDENTS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN CLOSE KIND WITH. AS WHEN A CAR YOU'VE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS JUST YES YES YES I HAVE ACCEPTED THE MMA KQ EIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. WE HAVE A MOTION. OKAY PLEASE CALL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I'M SORRY OH SORRY I KEEP MISSING THE CLOSED PART.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LOUIS GEORGIE AND I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CO FOUNDER OF THE NATALIE GEORGIE SUNSHINE FOUNDATION. OUR FOUNDATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN MEMORY OF OUR DAUGHTER WHO DIED TRAGICALLY CAMP SACRAMENTO. IN JULY TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AFTER EATING A RICE KRISPY TREAT THAT SHE THAT HAD UNDISCLOSED PEANUT BUTTER IN IT. SHE WAS THIRTEEN GOAL. AS A PHYSICIAN. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PREVALENCE OF LIFE THREATENING FOOD ALLERGIES HAS. RISEN FOR MYRIAD OF REASONS OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES. MANY OF THESE CHILDREN IN CHILD CLICK CHILD CARE ARE LIKELY UNDIAGNOSED GIVEN THEIR YOUNG AGE. THIS IS A CONCERN FOR EVERY PARENT AND EVERY CHILD CARE ST STE SAID IN SETTING. THESE CHILDREN MAY NOT YET BE EXPOSED TO THE SPECIFIC ALLERGEN OR MAY JUST NOT HAVE YET BEEN DIAGNOSED. FOOD ALLERGY STATUS CAN CHANGE THIS CONCERN IS SOMETHING THE PROCESS FOR ALL THESE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. SINCE WE LOST NATALIE. OUR FAMILY HAS WORKED TO MAKE THINGS SAFER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WE WERE HONORED BOARD SB TWELVE SIXTY SIX INTRODUCED BY THEN SENATOR BOB HUFF. WHICH ALLOWED FOR UNDESIGNATED EPIC EPINEPHRINE IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE ADVOCATED FOR RESTAURANT LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSED FOOD ALLERGIES AND INCLUDED CAMPUS DINING STAFF TO BE TRAINED IN FOOD ALLERGY SAFETY. THAT LEGISLATION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT PROPER CARE CAN IS KNOWN AS NATALIE'S LAW. THIS OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR FOOD ALLERGY LEGISLATION IN THE PAST. WE KNOW THAT THIS SUPPORT WILL CONTINUE BECAUSE THESE BILLS SAVE LIVES. ALISA IS TRAGIC DEATH.

RIGHT THIS CALL THE ROLL. I'LL ADAM EIGHT AB TWENTY FORTY TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL AYE MADONNA AYE DALLY. ALLEY I'VE DONE IT BY BENNETT I CHEN. PLEASE MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE QUIRK-SILVA BURKE SURVIVE. THE BILL HAS FIVE ALSO IT IS OUT THANK IS OUT WILL MOVE FORWARD. WITH THAT WILL GO TO MISTER MCCARTY FILE ITEM NUMBER. TWELVE AB. NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A MUCH OF A VOICE MUCH ENERGY NEAR PASSED THE MY BASS IS AWESOME BILL IF YOU WANT TO BE I LIKE THE EXIST A LOT OF THESE THINGS THAT'S OKAY TOO AND LIKE THE- DONALD LOVE FROM TWO HOURS AGO- NO. I TO ACCEPT THE COMEDIAN AND- FOR WORKING WITH US. NO WE KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR BOTH- KIDS AND ALSO FOR PARENTS THE- AB. ALL DAY VERSUS PART DAY KINDERGARTEN WE'VE STEPPED UP IN THE BUDGET LAST FEW YEARS TO TRY TO. HAVE MORE- SCHOOLS OFFER FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN NOT FULL DAY FULL SCHOOL DAY LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST AND SECOND THIRD GRADE. SO THIS IS A GOOD COMPROMISE PHASES IN A PROCESS WHERE. ALL SCHOOLS WILL HAVE AT LEAST ONE CLASSROOM AT THEIR SCHOOL SITE OFFERING FULL SCHOOL DAY. KINDERGARTEN WITH ME TO TESTIFY OUR LOCAL PARENT IN FRED RIVAS WITH AT YOUR- SOMEONE GO. MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M BRIAN RIVAS ON BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST UP YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES A GREAT JOB OF PULLING UP EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS FOR STUDENTS- COGNITIVE GROWTH MATH SKILL DEVELOPMENT LEARNING DON'T WORK AND PLAY WITH ONE ANOTHER ALL THOSE ARE GREAT BENEFITS THAT SET STUDENTS UP FOR SUCCESS THEIR FOUNDATIONAL THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE FISH PER STUDENT WHO. HAVE NOT HAD A THIS CALL WILL GRANT EARLY MEANS EIGHTEEN TALKING LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. SO WITH THIS IS AN M. S. IMPORTANT BILL FOR THOSE- I'M DOING POPULATIONS. ALSO BENEFIT FOR STATE FOR FAMILIES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES BECAUSE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN RELIEVES THE FAMILY OF THE COST AND BURDEN OF MANAGING CHILD CARE. ELEAZAR PRETTY FUNDED FOR A FULL DAY PROGRAM WE THINK IT'S TIME FOR. THE STATE GET THE RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT THERE'S ALSO BEEN A VERY HEALTHY INVESTMENT IN SCHOOL FACILITIES OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS. SO THOSE ARE THOSE WITH THE- BILL. SHINDAND PERSONALLY FOR EDUCATE MEDICAL SURGERY BOTH. GOOD AFTERNOON IT WAS CHRISTINA AND I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY IS. A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BILL AB ONE NINE SEVEN THREE. I HAVE TWO CHILDREN MY YOUNGEST IS STILL AN INFANT MY OLDEST IS CURRENTLY IN KINDERGARTEN. HAVING ACCESS TO A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN OUR PANELISTS LACKS. IT'S BEEN A LIFESAVING CROESOR FOR MEAT MAIN INCOME EIFFEL TIME JOB. LIKE MOST WORKING MOTHERS I DON'T HAVE SOMEONE PICK UP MY- WAIT FOR THE WAR. FOR KINDERGARTEN HAS READ YOU MY FAMILY'S FINANCIAL BURDEN CHILD CARE IS SO EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN MEANS I DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR ASK MANY HOURS OF CARE. PREVIOUSLY I HAD TO PICK UP MY CHILD AT TWELVE PM AND THIS MADE MAINTAINING MY ON A FULL TIME WORK SCHEDULE BOTH DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED. BANG FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL HOURS OF CARE CREATED A BIG FINANCIAL BURDEN TO. ACCESSING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN GIVES MY CHILD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH CHILDREN HIS AGE WHICH NURTURES HAS SOCIAL SKILLS AND BETTER PREPARES HIM FOR THE SCHOOL. IT ALSO GIVES FROM THE TIME HE NEEDS TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL LEARNING AND PLAY. PASSING THIS LEGISLATION WILL- GIVE ME GREATER CONFIDENCE THAT WHEN MY YOUNGEST HILD TURNS FIVE I WILL EASILY BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE REACH A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT MY CHILD NEEDS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE EIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORT. KATHY MANZINI ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- ANY CULTURALLY COMMITTEE MEMBERS OTHERS. MISS QUIRK-SILVA OR ANY OPPOSITION SORRY ANY OPPOSITION. I APOLOGIZED. GOOD AFTERNOON JEREMY MEMBERS SECRETARY FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION- WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION- CSPA HAS LONG BEEN ADVOCATE FOR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN- ARE ISSUES WITH THE ACTUAL USE THE CLASS SIZE REDUCTIONS AND ALL OF THIS IS BEEN A LONG STANDING FUND THAT'S BEEN USED FOR VERY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SCHOOL THE BY OUR CAN IT PRESENT NUMBER. THE CHALLENGES WE STILL. THE CURRENT NAY STAFF IN TEACHER SHORTAGE THAT WE ARE FACING TODAY FACILITIES ISSUES- AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION- CHALLENGES AND SO ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES RECOMMEND AMENDMENTS WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY GO FAR ENOUGH- WE BELIEVE THAT. A BETTER APPROACH IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE USE OF CSR WE THINK THAT. COMBINED ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THE GOAL FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN WITH CS OUR MEANT TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE A MUCH MORE ROBUST KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AGAIN- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS MEMBERS LEADERSHIP ON EXPANDING ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL EXPAND ACCESS TO CAN GUARD UP. THE RAMP ARE MAY CONCERN IS THE USE OF THIS YEAR'S ARSENAL FOR THIS PARTICULAR PURPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MEGAN BEAR WITH THE ASSOCIATION BRINGS COMMISSIONERS I JUST ECHO THE SENTIMENTS MAY COLLEAGUES RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER OPPOSITION SING OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK. I'LL JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS I STRUGGLE THIS- I DO BECAUSE- WE WERE ALTERING LC OF A BIT HERE I SIZE REDUCTION FORMULA- REMEMBER WHEN YOU GO TO FULL DAY YOU'RE PROBABLY TAKING A TEACHER OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. THE WAY IT TYPICALLY WORKS NOW. IS THIS IN MY EXPERIENCE. IS A MIGHT BE HAVE TAKEN A RIGHT. BUT YOU'LL HAVE TYPICALLY OF TWO TEACHERS IN THAT ROOM- DURING THAT- DURING THAT TIME. ALPHAGO FULL DAY THERE'S ONLY ONE TEACHER. THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST SOMETHING WE NEED TO. BE COGNIZANT OF SOMETHING OR WALKING INTO- THAT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE EFFORTS EIGHT. YOU MISTER. STUDENTS HAVE MORE CHALLENGES THAN OTHERS BE OFFERED THIS OFFER. AS SOON AS WE CAN GET IT TO THEM THAT'S KIND OF BUILT INTO THE BILL THE STAGGERED APPROACH- BUT WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILLS OR ANY. FURTHER CULTURALLY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISS QUIRK-SILVA. I SUPPORT THIS BILL- A FEW- TRENDS OF LATE FIRST OF ALL. THE HALF DAY KINDERGARTEN- WHICH MANY OF US HAVE OUR OWN CHILDREN AND- REALLY IS BECOMING SOMETHING OF THE PAST- AS WE SAID FOR. MORE AND MORE WORKING WOMEN PARTICULARLY WHO ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GETTING THEIR KIDS BACK. TO SCHOOL TO BE A- YOU. BUT NOT ONLY- HAVE A HALF DAY AND ONLY SAY HALF DAY IT'S REALLY. ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE HOURS- SO. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING A CHILD THAT YOU NEED TO PICK UP ABOUT ELEVEN THIRTY OR BEFORE NOON- AND SOME SCHOOLS DO OFFER AFTER SCHOOL PICK A CARE. BUT CARE IS OFTEN A CARE THAT HAS TO BE PAID FOR. BUT ASIDE FROM THAT. EDUCATION OF ADDITIONAL HOURS THAT EIGHT KENDER CHILD IS IN SCHOOL REALLY HAS. AN IMPACT THAT CAN KEEP UP WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS WHERE THEIR THEIR CHARTER WHETHER THEY'RE- PRIVATE SCHOOLS BUT- THERE IS MORE AND MORE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE CHOOSING THEIR NOT BEING MADE TO THEY'VE CHOSEN TO GO FULL DAY. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF TODAY'S EDUCATION SO I SUPPORT THIS. SITE AS FAR AS THE TEACHER RATIO UP MYSELF OFTEN TEACHING IN THE YOUNGER GRADES- SOMETIMES IT'S A MYTH THAT YOU HAVE TO TEACHERS IN THERE BECAUSE OF THE DOUBLE THERE'S ALWAYS. DIFFERENT WAYS THAT SCHOOL SITE DO DO THIS KIND OF- INJURY IN IT IT'S NOT THE FULL THREE HOURS THAT YOU HAVE TO TEACHER AND THEIR TIME THAT'S REALLY HALF OF THAT TIME- BUT THEN LASTLY WHAT I WOULD SAY. IS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ACCOMMODATING FOR TEACHING PRO AM- ADDITIONAL SPACE. A. B. IF THIS IS REALLY PUSH THROUGH OUR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ACCOMMODATING BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALSO KNOW WHICH IS WERE ON A DOWNWARD TREND OF ENROLLMENT SO THERE ARE GOING TO BE A CLASSROOMS THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE BECAUSE SCHOOL SIZES UP REALLY ENROLLMENT CONTINUING TO GO DOWN NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT BECAUSE OF THESE LONG TERM TRENDS I THINK WE ACCOMMODATE THIS AND GET OUR KINDERGARTENS DOUBLE THE TOP IN THE CLASS. IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE- BENEFIT THEM ESPECIALLY FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THANKS FOR READING THIS TOWARD. GREAT THANK YOU AND I JUST HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING THIS IS CHILD CARE WILL ACTUALLY LOOKING AT IT AS EDUCATION- I'VE HEARD MANY AND- KINDERGARTEN TEACHER ARGUE TO ME THEIR PROP TIME IS LONGER THAN OTHER TEACHERS. BECAUSE THE VERY TACTILE NATURE OF THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE THE CUTTING BETTER OF LETTERS ETCETERA. PREP TIME THEY HAVE TO DO FOR THEIR CLASSROOM SO JUST YOU KNOW DESERVE JUST THINGS WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT AS WE GO FORNOT OPPOSED TO IT. JUST REALIZE THE IMPACTS THIS COULD HAVE. ON TEACHERS ON STUDENTS AS A WHOLE WOULD AFFECT YOU MISTER MISTER. YEAH I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND I THINK ABOUT THOSE TEACHERS WHO DO TO. BOSS'S BIRTHDAY THAT'S A KILLER FOR THOSE TEACHERS WELL- TEACH ONE CLASS PER DAY THAT HAVE TO TEACH TO A DOUBLE CHECK FOR A KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS AND 80% OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ALREADY OFFER THIS WE THINK. WORKING WITH YOU GERALD DOT ON YOUR COMMITTEE WE HAVE A FAIR COMPROMISE THAT IT'S AT LEAST ONE CLASSROOM PER SCHOOL AND WE GIVE MULTIPLE YEARS TO PHASES THEN. WE ARE PROVIDING MONIES- FOR FACILITIES AND AS THE MISS QUIRK-SILVA SAID WE BECAUSE OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT ALLOTTEES DISTRICTS WILL HAVE. EXTRA CLASSROOM ANYWAY SO. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MORE INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTESIN KINDERGARTEN IN THE NOT BABY SITTING AT HELP STUDENTS- SUCCEED IN FIRST GRADE ON LOS WHAT HELPS. WORKING PARENTS BECAUSE GOING FOR THREE HOURS WE CAME OUT IF YOU GOT THE SECOND SHIFT. TO GO TO KINDERGARTEN AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GET A LOT OF. AND THEN TO PICK UP TOO I HOW YOU COULD HAVE A BILL TO GO TO WORK OF. IT'S SUPER BOWL. I CAN'T- SHIFT FOR- FOR THE PART DAY- SO THIS IS- AT IT'S A FAIR COPPER. MANIC POLICY GOING FOR CAL.
