MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITMENT COMMITTEE -- WE ALMOST HAVE ENOUGH MEMBERS FOR A QUORUM SO AT THIS TIME WE ARE GOING TO START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE HOW WE TYPICALLY DO WAIT FOR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TO COME BUT WE WILL BE HOLDING THE ROLE OPEN FOR ANYONE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AND I BELIEVE THESE. TWO ITEMS ARE RELATIVELY NON CONTROVERSIAL SO LET'S HEAR FIRST FROM MISTER STONE. FILE ITEM TO A. B.. THIRTY SIXTY SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS A. B. THIRTY SIXTY SIX IS A FARM BILL TO A BILL THAT. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR AND THE GOVERNOR VETOED THIS IS. A BILL THAT TRIES TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD WITH RESPECT TO MOBILE HOME [inaudible] OWNERS AND THE THAT PARK OWNERS. WHEN WE NEED TO ENFORCE THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LA? UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO ENFORCE MOJO RESIDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS WHO ARE TYPICALLY LOW INCOME IN MY DISTRICT MOBILE HOMES PROVIDE SOME OF A SIGNIFICANT FORMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ARE FORCED TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY WHICH THEY CAN'T AFFORD AND SO THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES THAT ULTIMATELY GOING RESOLVED. SO THE THE BILL THAT WE PUT ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK LAST YEAR. HAD THE FE H. BEING THE ONES COLLECTING THE MONEY UNDER THIS PROGRAM AND TRYING TO ENFORCE THE MOBILE HOME PRESIDENCY LAW. THAT WAS A PART THE GOVERNOR WAS NOT HAPPY WITH SO WE WENT BACK TO HIM AND HAVE NEGOTIATED. A PROGRAM NOW WITH A CD WERE HDD WILL COLLECT THE MONEY WILL TAKE A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE FILED. AND WILL THEN REFER OUT TO A LOCAL LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDER FOR THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE THE MOST EGREGIOUS. IT'S STILL ESSENTIALLY PILOT PROGRAM IT SET UP SO THAT EIGHTY WILL COLLECT THE MONEY FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. IN ORDER. TO FUND THIS SO THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FUNDED OUT OF OTHER FUNDS TO GO TO HTTP AND THEY'RE ONLY OBLIGATED TO ENFORCE. UP TO BE ABOUT OF MONEY COLLECTED. AFTER THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THIS. LIKE ORGAN WHAT'S TO DO SOME OF THINGS HOW EFFECTIVE PROGRAM IS WHAT THE DEMAND IS BITING THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT THIS IS GOING TO RESOLVE IS IT PROVIDES A FORUM. FOR ENFORCING MOBILE HOME PRESIDENCY LAW AND WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE ALL PARTIES TAKE THE VIOLATIONS OF THE EMERALD VERY SERIOUSLY AND GIVE FOLKS A FORM FOR THE MOST EGREGIOUS ACTIONS. THIS IS THE I THINK GOVERNMENT IT'S AT ITS BEST TRY TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. AND GIVEN APPROPRIATE FORM WHERE ONE IS NECESSARY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I DON'T RIGHT EYEWITNESSES. HIGH ESPERANZA ROSS ON BEHALF OF GSM WHILE THE GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURED HOMEOWNERS LAKE -- WERE HERE AND SUPPORT. WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR WORKING WITH BOTH THE GOVERNOR AT GOVERNOR BROWN'S ADMINISTRATION OVER THIS PAST YEAR AND MORE RECENTLY WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST PARK OWNER GROUPS. IT AB THIRTY SIXTY SIX REFLECTS THE COMPROMISE AN AGREEMENT WE ASK YOUR CONSIDERATION THINK YOU. MAY I ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL ROGER JOHNSON. AND I AM A VETERAN THE ANIMAL HOMEOWNER. AND THE BEEN FOLLOWING A. B. -- THREE SIX SIX FROM ITS BEGINNING LAST YEAR AS TWELVE SIXTY NINE MYSELF MY NEIGHBORS WE ADVOCATE TOGETHER. AND WE REALLY NEED HELP. WITH ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH. MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS -- SETTING THE TABLE -- SO THAT WE CAN ALL BEGIN TO TALK AND RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH EACH OTHER. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE THE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THAT SUPPORT THIS BILL. THAT'S GOOD OPPOSITION. CHAIR MEMBERS CATHARINE BORDER THE WESTERN MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATION. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE STILL IN AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION WE UP REALIZE IT CAN GET AMENDED AT THIS POINT BUT ON WE HAD REQUESTED THAT THERE WOULD BE THIRTY DAYS TO CORRECT ANY EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS BEFORE WENT TO COURT -- THE BILL ONLY HAS TWENTY FIVE AND THOSE FIVE DAYS MIGHT MEAN A LOT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WHO CAN'T GET. A CONTRACTOR OUT THERE OR SOMEONE. TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT SENT TO YOU ON SENT TO THE LEGAL PROCESS. SO THAT'S STILL A CONCERN OF OURS WE APPRECIATE THE TWENTY FIVE THAT WAS NEGOTIATED BY THE OTHER TRADE ASSOCIATION. ON THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IS WITH REGARD TO THE FEE. AND THE FEE IS GOING TO BE APPLIED TO ALL MOBILE HOME LOTS IN OUR MOBILE HOME PARKS BUT THIS PROGRAM ONLY APPLIES TO OF SPACES THAT APPLY UNDER THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LA. WHICH THERE'S A THEIR BIG GAP THERE SO IF WE HAVE PARK ON RENTALS ARE VIEWS OR EVEN VACANT LOTS WILL BE PAYING A FEE FOR SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DON'T GET ANY BENEFIT FROM -- AND I THINK. LASTLY. IF WE HAD BEEN AT THE TABLE. TO HELP NEGOTIATE THIS WITH AGE CD I THINK THAT WE WOULD OF TRIED TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM WHERE ALL. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS WOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE DEPARTMENT -- SOME OF THE SMALLER COMPLAINTS ARE GOING TO BE GONE ERA CAN BE I HEARD AND IT'S ONLY THE EGREGIOUS COMPLAINTS ARE GOING TO BE -- ACTED UPON BY AGE CITY SO WITH ALL THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE [inaudible] THANK YOU.
