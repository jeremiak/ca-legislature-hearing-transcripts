SEND BILL FIVE SIXTEEN BY SENATOR ADMIN AND I RELATING TO POKE SOCIAL SERVICE CENTER AYMAN. THE YOU VERY MUCH TODAY I PRESENT SP FIVE C. A BILL THAT I THINK WILL ACT AS A NARROWING IN SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. UNDER CURRENT LAW A PERSON EXPERIENCE A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CAN BE HELD FOR TREATMENT INVOLUNTARILY F THEY MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA. TYPICALLY WE THINK ABOUT THIS IS A FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND IT PROVIDES WITH THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD THEY COULD THEN BE RELEASED OR HEARING CAN BE HELD TO DETERMINE WHETHER CONDITION REQUIRES ADDITIONAL AND INTENSIVE CARE. UNDER THIS BILL A HEARING OFFICER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONSIDER INFORMATION REQUIRING A PRISON'S MEDICAL CONDITION AND HOW THAT CONDITION BEARS ON THE CERTIFICATION OF WHETHER THEY ARE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES GRAVELY DISABLED WHEN THE TURNING. TO CONTINUE HOLD. FOR THE ADDITIONAL TREATMENT. WITH A MIDDLE HEALTH ISSUE BLACK PASS TO BUY FOR THE BASE NEEDS OF. CLOTHING AND SHELTER. THE LAW CONSIDERS THEM GRAVELY DISABLED ALLOWS TREATMENT OVER ANY OBJECTIONS TO STABILIZE THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS. RESTORE CAPACITY AND REDUCE THE RISK OF. SELF HARM. UNDER CURRENT HOWEVER CURRENT LAW FAILS TO ADDRESS INDIVIDUALS WITH A MENTAL. ILLNESS WHO LACKED THE PASSION TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS. THAT'S B. FIVE SIXTEEN INCLUDE SPECIFIC CRITERIA REGARDING THE DANGERS OF THE CONDITION AND THE PROGNOSIS OF HARM WITHIN SIX MONTHS ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS. TO BE CLEAR NOTHING IN THIS BILL ALLOWS DRAMATIC MANDATED MEDICAL TREATMENT. IT ONLY SEEKS TO RESTORE AN INDIVIDUAL'S CAPACITY TO CARE FOR THEIR SERIOUS MEDICAL NEEDS.

CALIFORNIA CARD CLUBS ARE FUNDAMENTAL **** TO MANY LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SOME EVEN SERVICE THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF TAX REVENUE FOR THE CITY IN WHICH THEY'RE LOCATED. CARDROOM TAXES FUND ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING FUNDING FOR PARKS WATER DELIVERY AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.

THE CURRENT MORATORIUM ON COURT ROOM EXPANSION THE SET TO SUNSET JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. FURTHERMORE THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TABLES THAT MAYBE LOCALLY APPROVED IN EXISTING CARD ROOM SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. TO ENSURE STABILITY AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES THIS BILL WILL EXTEND THE CURRENT MORATORIUM TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT AND ALLOW A MODEST INCREASE IN TABLES AT EXISTING CARD CLUBS. TO BE SPECIFIC THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SUBJECT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT APPROVAL UP TO TWO TABLES FOR YEAR WITH A MAXIMUM OF TEN ADDITIONAL TABLES. IN TURN THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE NEEDED FINANCIAL STABILITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT RELY ON REVENUE FROM LICENSED GAMING.
