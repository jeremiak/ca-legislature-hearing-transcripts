CALIFORNIA.

00:37:31.516 --> 00:37:34.486 region:rollup2
AND I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE STAT

00:37:32.884 --> 00:37:35.854 region:rollup2
NEWS. ARTICLE VERY COMPELLING

00:37:34.486 --> 00:37:37.222 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THE FACES OF

00:37:35.854 --> 00:37:38.857 region:rollup2
THE EPIDEMIC AND WHEN YOU LOOK

00:37:37.222 --> 00:37:40.024 region:rollup2
AT THESE FACES IS JUST STRIKING

00:37:38.857 --> 00:37:41.826 region:rollup2
HOW YOUNG THEY ARE BECAUSE

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:43.561 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:45.363 region:rollup2
KILL FAR MORE PEOPLE.

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:46.731 region:rollup2
THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO KILL YOU IN

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.899 region:rollup2
YOUR SLEEP TONIGHT AND THAT'S

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:49.834 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE TRAGEDIES OF THE

00:37:47.899 --> 00:37:51.369 region:rollup2
OPIATE EPIDEMIC IS KILLS PEOPLE

00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:53.471 region:rollup2
YOUNG IT KILLS PEOPLE SUDDENLY.

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:55.640 region:rollup2
AND A FAMILY DOCTOR AND I WAS

00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:57.308 region:rollup2
TRAINED IN THE AREA. WHERE WE

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.545 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WE ARE HELPING PEOPLE BY

00:37:57.308 --> 00:38:03.915 region:rollup2
GIVING OPIOIDS TO? CONDITIONS WE

00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:05.917 region:rollup2
NEVER GIVE UP UNITS AT DOSES

00:38:03.915 --> 00:38:08.386 region:rollup2
THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY SEEN ONLY

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:10.488 region:rollup2
IN HOSPICE AND LIKE MANY OF MY

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:13.458 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES I GOT A WAKE UP CALL.

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:15.360 region:rollup2
WHEN I GOT A CALL FROM A CORNER

00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:17.862 region:rollup2
OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DIED OF MY

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:21.566 region:rollup2
PILSENER HAND AGAIN THINKING

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:22.767 region:rollup2
THAT I WAS BEING HELPFUL ONLY

00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:23.701 region:rollup2
ENDING IN HARM.

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.769 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.837 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS DOING COMPARED TO

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:26.638 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE U. S. IT CAN BE

00:38:25.837 --> 00:38:28.306 region:rollup2
EASY TO BE FALSELY REASSURING

00:38:26.638 --> 00:38:28.506 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE REST OF THE U. S.

00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:29.807 region:rollup2
THERE.

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:31.309 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:32.610 region:rollup2
OVERDOSE RATE IS TWICE ALMOST

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:34.546 region:rollup2
TWICE OURS AND WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.047 region:rollup2
THE RATE OF INCREASE LAST YEAR

00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:37.081 region:rollup2
THEY THE U. S. INCREASED BY

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:38.149 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE PERCENT WERE ARE.

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:39.250 region:rollup2
OVERDOSE RATES HAVE BEEN FAIRLY

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.084 region:rollup2
STABLE AND I DO THINK IT'S A

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.652 region:rollup2
CREDIT TO DOCTOR SMITH ON THE

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:41.252 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:42.754 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE OVER THE LAST FEW

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:44.322 region:rollup2
YEARS. TO INCREASE ACCESS TO

00:38:42.754 --> 00:38:45.790 region:rollup2
TREATMENT AND CHANGE PRESCRIBING

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:47.192 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT'S.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.060 region:rollup2
IT'S SOME REALLY IMPORTANT NOT

00:38:47.192 --> 00:38:50.395 region:rollup2
TO JUST FOCUS ON THE CLIFORNIA

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.963 region:rollup2
AVERAGE BECAUSE HALF OF

00:38:50.395 --> 00:38:53.598 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS LIVE SOUTH OF THE

00:38:51.963 --> 00:38:55.333 region:rollup2
BURBANK AIRPORT AND SO THE.

00:38:53.598 --> 00:38:57.035 region:rollup2
AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN IS REALLY

00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:58.703 region:rollup2
STORY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:57.035 --> 00:39:00.104 region:rollup2
WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE MUCH

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:01.206 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAT THE RATES ARE LOWER

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:02.807 region:rollup2
SYSTEM POINT TO LOOK AT THE

00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:05.109 region:rollup2
VARIATION IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:06.911 region:rollup2
THESE? GRAPHS COME FROM THE DASH

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:08.479 region:rollup2
FOR THE DOCTOR SMITH REFERENCE

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:10.548 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN SEE PARTS OF OUR

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:12.217 region:rollup2
STATE OURS HARD HIT IS KENTUCKY

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:13.585 region:rollup2
IN OTHER AREAS. OF THE COUNTRY

00:39:12.217 --> 00:39:14.919 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SEE IN THE NEWS ALL THE

00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:16.387 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:17.956 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:19.691 region:rollup2
THE COMPLEXITY OF HOW WE GOT

00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:21.860 region:rollup2
INTO THIS PREDICAMENT BECAUSE

00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:23.428 region:rollup2
THERE'S GONNA BE NO YOU KNOW APT

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.796 region:rollup2
TO SOLVE THE OPIATE EPIDEMIC WAS

00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:26.464 region:rollup2
THIS COMPLEX TO GET HERE IS

00:39:24.796 --> 00:39:28.132 region:rollup2
COMPLEX TO GET OUT OF HERE OUT

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:30.201 region:rollup2
OF IT. CLEARLY OPIOID

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:32.503 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING DROVE A BIG PIECE OF

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:33.104 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE THE MORE WE DOCTORS

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:34.672 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBE THE HIGHER THE DEATH

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:35.907 region:rollup2
RATE.

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:37.408 region:rollup2
BUT AS A AS DR SMITH SAID MORE

00:39:35.907 --> 00:39:38.843 region:rollup2
AND MORE OF THIS IS BECOMING AN

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:40.545 region:rollup2
ILLICIT DRUG PROBLEM THAT LAW

00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:43.214 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT CAN'T POSSIBLY KEEP

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:45.049 region:rollup2
UP WITH. BECAUSE YOU CAN GET FAT

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:47.318 region:rollup2
NOW IN A PILL PRESS ONLINE FOR

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:49.254 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PUSH

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:50.922 region:rollup2
OUT COUNTERFEIT PILLS AND SEND

00:39:49.254 --> 00:39:52.624 region:rollup2
YOUR CHECK THAT ONE DOWN TEN

00:39:50.922 --> 00:39:53.324 region:rollup2
MORE POP ABSOLUTE VERY CLEAR

00:39:52.624 --> 00:39:55.260 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE'RE GONNA STOP THIS

00:39:53.324 --> 00:39:58.096 region:rollup2
EPIDEMIC. WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.163 region:rollup2
TREATMENT EASIER TO GET THAN

00:39:58.096 --> 00:40:00.031 region:rollup2
HEROIN AND THAT NO.

00:39:59.163 --> 00:40:01.366 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS MAP

00:40:00.031 --> 00:40:02.901 region:rollup2
FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE RED

00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:04.836 region:rollup2
AREAS ARE PLACES WITH NO OPI

00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:06.304 region:rollup2
TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AND IF YOU

00:40:04.836 --> 00:40:07.605 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THE OTHER MAPS THAT

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:09.374 region:rollup2
THOSE OF THE SAME AREAS WITH THE

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:10.775 region:rollup2
HIGH DEATH RATES AND SO THIS IS.

00:40:09.374 --> 00:40:12.744 region:rollup2
WHAT WORKED SYSTEMATICALLY

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:14.779 region:rollup2
TACKLING IN CALIFORNIA TO FILL

00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:16.881 region:rollup2
THOSE RED AREAS OF OUR STATE

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:18.383 region:rollup2
WITH TREATMENT ACCESS?

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:18.883 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING

00:40:18.383 --> 00:40:20.285 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS.

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:21.686 region:rollup2
WITH CALLED AN EPIDEMIC OF

00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:23.888 region:rollup2
DESPAIR BECAUSE THERE'S MANY

00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:25.523 region:rollup2
SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY FACTOR

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:26.658 region:rollup2
DRIVING PEOPLE THE OPIATE

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:27.892 region:rollup2
ADDICTION IF YOU HAVE IT READ

00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:30.028 region:rollup2
DREAMLAND THAT'S A FASCINATING.

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:31.896 region:rollup2
STORY OF AND UNDERSTANDING HOW

00:40:30.028 --> 00:40:32.397 region:rollup2
THIS ALL CAME TOGETHER IN SOME

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:34.198 region:rollup2
OF THE.

00:40:32.397 --> 00:40:35.500 region:rollup2
LOTS OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.734 region:rollup2
AND SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT HAVE

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.336 region:rollup2
HAVE CREATED SOME OF THE

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:39.671 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS IN RURAL PARTS OF OUR

00:40:38.336 --> 00:40:41.005 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:43.207 region:rollup2
SO AS DR SMITH MENTIONED THERE

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:45.009 region:rollup2
THERE'S EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT FOUR

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:46.377 region:rollup2
MAJOR PARTS TO COMBAT THE OPIATE

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:49.013 region:rollup2
EPIDEMIC AND WE'RE WORKING ON

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:50.515 region:rollup2
ALL FOUR ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:51.416 region:rollup2
LIFTER PREVENT A NEW GENERATION

00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:53.985 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE FROM BECOMING

00:40:51.416 --> 00:40:55.153 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT.

00:40:53.985 --> 00:40:56.654 region:rollup2
CORD ADDICTED TO THOSE DRUGS AS

00:40:55.153 --> 00:40:59.057 region:rollup2
WORKAROUND PREVENTION WE HAVE

00:40:56.654 --> 00:41:00.158 region:rollup2
JUST MORE SAFELY MANAGE CHRONIC

00:40:59.057 --> 00:41:01.859 region:rollup2
PAIN WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING A

00:41:00.158 --> 00:41:03.661 region:rollup2
BACKLASH WHERE PEOPLE THAT WE

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:04.929 region:rollup2
DOCTORS HAVE MADE DEPENDED ON

00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:06.764 region:rollup2
THESE OPIOIDS.

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:08.333 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY LOSE ACT ACCESS BECAUSE

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:10.168 region:rollup2
DOCTORS SAY CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE

00:41:08.333 --> 00:41:11.269 region:rollup2
NOT TO PRESCRIBE OPIOIDS AT ALL

00:41:10.168 --> 00:41:13.237 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S.

00:41:11.269 --> 00:41:14.105 region:rollup2
CREATES A DANGER BOTH FOR THE

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:15.173 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON

00:41:14.105 --> 00:41:16.274 region:rollup2
OPIOIDS AND ALSO FOR PEOPLE ON

00:41:15.173 --> 00:41:17.375 region:rollup2
PALETTE OF CARE HOSPICE WHO NEED

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:19.077 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:20.645 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO

00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:21.979 region:rollup2
ARE HIGHEST RISK AND HELP THEM

00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:23.881 region:rollup2
GET TO SEE PRODUCES AND NOT LACK

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:24.882 region:rollup2
ACCESS FOR ALL.

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:26.684 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO TREAT MEDIC.

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:29.420 region:rollup2
ADDICTION EFFECTIVELY AND IT'S

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:31.089 region:rollup2
QUITE CLEAR THAT IN OPIOIDS. ON

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.824 region:rollup2
OPIATE ADDICTION MEDICATIONS AND

00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:34.759 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS CRITICAL

00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:36.127 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WITHOUT MEDICATIONS THE

00:41:34.759 --> 00:41:37.662 region:rollup2
OVERDOSE RATE DOUBLED OR EVEN

00:41:36.127 --> 00:41:39.897 region:rollup2
TRIPLED.

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:40.898 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY WE HAVE TO STOP OVER

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:42.467 region:rollup2
DOES DOES UNTIL WE CAN DEAL WITH

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:44.202 region:rollup2
THE SUPPLY PROBLEM IN THE DEMAND

00:41:42.467 --> 00:41:45.636 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THROUGH IT TREATMENT WE

00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:48.239 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE SURE USING HARM

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:49.540 region:rollup2
REDUCTION. LIKE NALOXONE AGAIN

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:51.876 region:rollup2
DOCTOR SMITH MENTIONED IS IN THE

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.477 region:rollup2
OVERDOSE ANTIDOTES TO HELP SAVE

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:53.845 region:rollup2
LIVES AND PEOPLE ACCIDENTALLY

00:41:52.477 --> 00:41:54.879 region:rollup2
OVERDOSED.

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:55.847 region:rollup2
SO JUST A QUICK SNAPSHOT ON HOW

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:57.415 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING IN EACH OF THOSE

00:41:55.847 --> 00:42:00.284 region:rollup2
FRONTS WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR

00:41:57.415 --> 00:42:01.552 region:rollup2
PREVENTION EFFORTS ARE TOTAL NET

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:03.121 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF OPIATES WE PRESCRIBE

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:04.889 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN DROPPING OVER THE LAST

00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:06.491 region:rollup2
FEW YEARS. ARE HIGH DOSE

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:08.259 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIONS MEANING PEOPLE WHO

00:42:06.491 --> 00:42:09.727 region:rollup2
ARE TAKING THE EQUIVALENT OF

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:11.829 region:rollup2
TWENTY NOR CAL A DAY.

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:12.663 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN BE A TEENY LITTLE

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:14.265 region:rollup2
PILL AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS

00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:16.534 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE. DON'T UNDERSTAND IS

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:18.870 region:rollup2
AN TINY OXYCONTIN TABLET EIGHTY

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:21.005 region:rollup2
MILLIGRAMS A TO SMALLER THAN IT

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:23.174 region:rollup2
THEN AND BABY ASPIRIN. IS THE

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:25.109 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY FOUR NERVE

00:42:23.174 --> 00:42:25.910 region:rollup2
CHO AND AGAIN THAT'S WHY.

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:27.645 region:rollup2
NGUYEN THEN AMOUNT OF

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:29.414 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING HAS BEEN SO HIGH

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:30.915 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A SMALL PILLS JUST THAT

00:42:29.414 --> 00:42:31.783 region:rollup2
POTENT. BUT AGAIN WE'RE DOING

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:33.951 region:rollup2
BETTER WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:42:31.783 --> 00:42:35.153 region:rollup2
ON HIGH DOSE DROPPING.

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:36.621 region:rollup2
I TREAT EM ALTHOUGH

00:42:35.153 --> 00:42:37.989 region:rollup2
BUPRENORPHINE OR SUBOXONE YOU'VE

00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:38.990 region:rollup2
HEARD IS A IS A VERY COMMON

00:42:37.989 --> 00:42:40.324 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FOR OPIATE ADDICTION

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:41.859 region:rollup2
IT'S OUT THE ONLY TREATMENT BUT

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:43.861 region:rollup2
IT'S THE ONE THAT WE CAN TRACK

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:45.096 region:rollup2
IN CARRIERS IN THE DATABASE AND

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:46.264 region:rollup2
WE USE IT AS A MARKER FOR HOW

00:42:45.096 --> 00:42:47.732 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING WITH ADDICTION

00:42:46.264 --> 00:42:49.801 region:rollup2
TREATMENT. ACCESS AND WE'RE

00:42:47.732 --> 00:42:52.703 region:rollup2
GETTING BETTER AS WELL BUT AGAIN

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:54.238 region:rollup2
THIS IS WE CAN'T REST BECAUSE

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:55.907 region:rollup2
OUR OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE NOT

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:56.908 region:rollup2
DROPPED.

00:42:55.907 --> 00:42:57.809 region:rollup2
THAT KNOWN HEROINES GOING UP IN

00:42:56.908 --> 00:42:59.744 region:rollup2
SOME VERY FEARFUL OF WHAT WE'RE

00:42:57.809 --> 00:43:00.778 region:rollup2
GONNA SEE NEXT YEAR.

00:42:59.744 --> 00:43:03.681 region:rollup2
UNLESS WE REALLY.

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:04.982 region:rollup2
DO BETTER WITH TREATMENT.

00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:06.017 region:rollup2
SO JUST A QUICK WORD ABOUT

00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:07.151 region:rollup2
TREATMENT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S VERY

00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:08.586 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT I THINK IF YOU'RE NOT

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:10.455 region:rollup2
MEDICINE UNDERSTAND WHY ON EARTH

00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:11.422 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU REPLACE A DRUG WITH A

00:43:10.455 --> 00:43:12.623 region:rollup2
DRUG AND IT'S IMPORTANT

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:14.325 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:16.461 region:rollup2
BRAIN WITH LONG TERM OPIOID

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:18.095 region:rollup2
ADDICTION. THE PART OF MY BRAIN.

00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:19.530 region:rollup2
CALL THE DOPAMINE ACCESS THAT

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:21.165 region:rollup2
REGULATES.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.900 region:rollup2
HOW WE CONNECT WITH OTHERS HOW

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:25.169 region:rollup2
WE DO THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT?

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.737 region:rollup2
HOW WE ORGANIZE OURSELVES THAT

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:28.506 region:rollup2
GETS BROKEN AND OPIATE ADDICTION

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:30.441 region:rollup2
AND THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING AN

00:43:28.506 --> 00:43:31.742 region:rollup2
ADDICT IS DATED DAY CHAOS AND

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:33.411 region:rollup2
SURVIVAL OF?

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:35.246 region:rollup2
DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN NOT TO

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:36.647 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GONNA DIE WHICH

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:37.715 region:rollup2
IS WHAT DOPES THAT MEANS IF YOU

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:39.951 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GONNA DIE

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:41.352 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING. HURTS YOU CAN'T

00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:42.854 region:rollup2
FOCUS AND BUT WHEN YOU GET ON A

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:45.256 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE MEDICATIONS WHICH

00:43:42.854 --> 00:43:48.359 region:rollup2
STABILIZE BRAIN CHEMISTRY. THAT

00:43:45.256 --> 00:43:49.660 region:rollup2
ALLOWS PEOPLE TO THINK PLAN BOND

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:51.596 region:rollup2
WITH OTHERS AND PARTICIPATE

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.530 region:rollup2
RECOVERY. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:43:51.596 --> 00:43:54.765 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THEIR THREE

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.501 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS THAT ARE APPROVED

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:58.703 region:rollup2
FOR OPIOID ADDICTION BUT THEY'RE

00:43:56.501 --> 00:43:59.837 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT.

00:43:58.703 --> 00:44:02.740 region:rollup2
NASDAQ DISMISSIVELY CAN'T A ONE

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:04.308 region:rollup2
SIZE FITS. ALL APPROACH BECAUSE

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.910 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THE METHADONE DEEPEN OUR

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:07.445 region:rollup2
FEET HAVE BOTH PROVEN TO DROP

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.880 region:rollup2
DEATH RATES IN HALF WERE BY EVEN

00:44:07.445 --> 00:44:11.749 region:rollup2
TWO THIRDS.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.984 region:rollup2
NOW TRACKS OWN WORKS WONDERFULLY

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:14.552 region:rollup2
I USE OFTEN HECKLED HIM THE

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.486 region:rollup2
TRIAL AND IN SUB POPULATIONS

00:44:14.552 --> 00:44:16.621 region:rollup2
LIKE PEOPLE WITH LICENSES LIKE

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.688 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND PILOTS

00:44:16.621 --> 00:44:19.357 region:rollup2
AND DOCTORS.

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:20.224 region:rollup2
BUT THEY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:44:19.357 --> 00:44:21.325 region:rollup2
GET ON AND ON THE FOURTH OF

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:22.960 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DROP OFF BEFORE THEY CAN

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.528 region:rollup2
EVEN GET ON IN THE TO TWELVE

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.229 region:rollup2
MONTHS SUCCESS RATE IS QUITE

00:44:23.528 --> 00:44:26.030 region:rollup2
LOW.

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:27.398 region:rollup2
SO EVEN OF THIS BEEN A LOT OF

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.332 region:rollup2
PRESS ABOUT BEING THE SAME AS A

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:30.668 region:rollup2
BOXER AND FOR THREE MONTHS IT'S

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:32.303 region:rollup2
TRUE SHORT TERM. BUT WE DON'T

00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:33.237 region:rollup2
KNOW A LOT OF TENNIS AGAIN OUR

00:44:32.303 --> 00:44:34.572 region:rollup2
GOAL IS GOING TO GET ALL FORMS

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:37.441 region:rollup2
OF TREATMENT AVAILABLE TO ALL

00:44:34.572 --> 00:44:38.609 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN ALL SETTINGS. IT

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:40.978 region:rollup2
INCLUDING IN JAILS.

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:41.612 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE SEVERAL CAMPAIGNS

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:42.513 region:rollup2
THAT DOCTOR SMITH REFERRED TO

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:43.781 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:46.117 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT EACH ONE.

00:44:43.781 --> 00:44:48.119 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE AND THEY'RE ALL.

00:44:46.117 --> 00:44:50.288 region:rollup2
REPORTING TO THE WE'RE PROVE ALL

00:44:48.119 --> 00:44:52.323 region:rollup2
AIMING TO STAY IN ALIGNMENT TO

00:44:50.288 --> 00:44:53.591 region:rollup2
LEAVE THIS WHO WOULD FOR TYLER

00:44:52.323 --> 00:44:54.959 region:rollup2
CARRIES TO PLANO SMARTCAMP

00:44:53.591 --> 00:44:56.193 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:44:54.959 --> 00:44:57.862 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA OPIATES SAFETY

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:59.163 region:rollup2
NETWORK AND THAT WHAT HEALTH

00:44:57.862 --> 00:45:00.998 region:rollup2
CARE SERVICES IS DOING WITH

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:02.066 region:rollup2
ADDICTION AND I'M WITH LIMITED

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:04.302 region:rollup2
TIME I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:05.369 region:rollup2
TOUCH AND EACH. WITH KIDS TO

00:45:04.302 --> 00:45:06.671 region:rollup2
PLANO AS A DOCTOR I CAN NOW LOOK

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:07.772 region:rollup2
UP INSTEAD OF. THE WAY IT WAS A

00:45:06.671 --> 00:45:09.407 region:rollup2
FEW YEARS AGO WHERE I GET

00:45:07.772 --> 00:45:10.875 region:rollup2
CONFUSING REPORTS I GET KICKED

00:45:09.407 --> 00:45:13.044 region:rollup2
OUT A LOT I CAN GET A PASSWORD

00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:14.178 region:rollup2
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE. THIS

00:45:13.044 --> 00:45:15.680 region:rollup2
IS PHENOMENAL BECAUSE I CAN GO

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:17.582 region:rollup2
IN AND I CAN SEE ALERTS FOR WHO

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.616 region:rollup2
OF MY PATIENTS AT HIGHEST RISK

00:45:17.582 --> 00:45:19.083 region:rollup2
OF DEATH AND THAT'S A GAME

00:45:18.616 --> 00:45:21.052 region:rollup2
CHANGER IS NATIONALLY

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:22.987 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED.

00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:24.555 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT THAT HELPFUL UNLESS

00:45:22.987 --> 00:45:25.823 region:rollup2
IT'S INTEROPERABLE WITH MY

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:27.692 region:rollup2
RECORDS BECAUSE I'M SEEING

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:30.061 region:rollup2
PATIENTS EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES.

00:45:27.692 --> 00:45:31.262 region:rollup2
I CAN'T STOP LOG OUT LOG ON TO

00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:33.130 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE AND CHECK

00:45:31.262 --> 00:45:35.266 region:rollup2
SOMETHING EXPECT THAT TO BE DONE

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.367 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY SO.

00:45:35.266 --> 00:45:37.401 region:rollup2
BUILDING INTO THE WORK FLOWS

00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:38.703 region:rollup2
SOMETHING DOJ'S REALLY WORKING

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:41.272 region:rollup2
HARD ON OUT IT'S GOING TO BE

00:45:38.703 --> 00:45:43.040 region:rollup2
CRITICAL OF TWO. MORE ADOPTION

00:45:41.272 --> 00:45:44.275 region:rollup2
OF THE OF CARE IS BY CLINICIANS.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.543 region:rollup2
ITS MARKET CALIFORNIA'S VERY

00:45:44.275 --> 00:45:47.111 region:rollup2
EXCITING BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST

00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:49.347 region:rollup2
TIME THE BIG PUBLIC PURCHASERS

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:51.682 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS.

00:45:49.347 --> 00:45:52.984 region:rollup2
CALPERS COVERED CALIFORNIA MEDI

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:54.385 region:rollup2
CAL HAVE ALL DONE TOGETHER AND

00:45:52.984 --> 00:45:56.320 region:rollup2
SING AND SAID WE ARE GOING TO

00:45:54.385 --> 00:45:58.589 region:rollup2
COORDINATE AND WORK TOGETHER TO

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.091 region:rollup2
DROP OVERDOSED ASSN ADDITION TO

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:01.425 region:rollup2
DROP UNNECESSARY SEE SECTIONS

00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:03.160 region:rollup2
AND BETTER. CARE OF LOW BACK

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:04.629 region:rollup2
PAIN AND SO THEY'RE WORKING WITH

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.464 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS AND

00:46:04.629 --> 00:46:07.765 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS AGAIN TRYING TO LINE

00:46:06.464 --> 00:46:09.767 region:rollup2
ALL OUR EFFORTS BECAUSE HEALTH

00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:10.901 region:rollup2
PLANS ARE POWERFUL ALLY AGAINST

THE A BICU EIGHT.

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:13.771 region:rollup2
CRISIS BECAUSE I'M DOING THE

ADDICTION TREATMENT IS EASY

00:46:16.474 --> 00:46:20.878 region:rollup2
ACCESS. IS CRITICAL BECAUSE AS

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:22.213 region:rollup2
YOU PROBABLY HAD MANY PEOPLE ARE

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:24.548 region:rollup2
READY TO QUIT BUT THEN HAVE

00:46:22.213 --> 00:46:26.217 region:rollup2
INSURANCE CHALLENGES GETTING THE

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:27.184 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THEY NEED.

00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:28.386 region:rollup2

THEY LOOK AT THE LOCAL DATA SAY

00:46:45.403 --> 00:46:47.905 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM IN OUR

00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:49.307 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND WORK TOGETHER TO

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:50.307 region:rollup2
SOLVE IT AND SO IT'S VERY

00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:52.243 region:rollup2
EXCITING FOR THAT WE'VE OF.

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:53.377 region:rollup2
IN JUST EIGHTEEN MONTHS SINCE

00:46:52.243 --> 00:46:55.513 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:56.847 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION STARTED THIS PROJECT

00:46:55.513 --> 00:46:58.382 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING MOST OF CALIFORNIA

00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:59.717 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING AND THE PUBLIC

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:01.986 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSTITUTE IS PUT IS

00:46:59.717 --> 00:47:02.920 region:rollup2
PUTTING FORTY VISTA VOLUNTEERS

00:47:01.986 --> 00:47:05.189 region:rollup2
IN ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES TO

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.757 region:rollup2
HELP. FIGHT THE EPIDEMIC SO WAS

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:07.892 region:rollup2
THAT A GOOD WORKFORCE IT'S QUITE

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:09.360 region:rollup2
EXCITING.

00:47:07.892 --> 00:47:10.895 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.329 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO MAJOR EFFORTS THAT

00:47:10.895 --> 00:47:13.831 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH SERVICES DEPARTMENT

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:15.433 region:rollup2
IS LEADING TO MAKE SURE THAT MAP

00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:16.867 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN THAT EVERYBODY CAN

00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:18.636 region:rollup2
ACCESS TREATMENT IN THEIR

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:20.371 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT TRAVEL. ON

00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:21.939 region:rollup2
THE LEFT IS THE DRUG MEDI CAL

00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:24.008 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE ALL OF THOSE ORANGE

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:25.843 region:rollup2
COUNTY'S HAVE PLANS TO CREATE

00:47:24.008 --> 00:47:26.777 region:rollup2
ADDICTION TREATMENT ACCESS FOR

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:28.946 region:rollup2
ALL ADDICTIONS NOT JUST FOR

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:29.947 region:rollup2
OPIOIDS. AND ON THE RIGHT IS A

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:31.515 region:rollup2
REAL.

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:33.718 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION OF HOW WE THINK

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:35.052 region:rollup2
ABOUT METHADONE CLINICS IN THE

00:47:33.718 --> 00:47:36.754 region:rollup2
PAST METHADONE CLINICS WHERE IN

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:38.155 region:rollup2
GHETTOS AND THEY WERE SEGREGATED

00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:39.623 region:rollup2
AND THEY NEVER WOULD TALK TO ME

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:40.658 region:rollup2
A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR. AND WE'RE

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:42.593 region:rollup2
TRYING TO CHANGE IT INTO A

00:47:40.658 --> 00:47:44.328 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTY

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:45.463 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WHERE FIVE A.

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:46.864 region:rollup2
COMPLEX HEART FAILURE PATIENTS

00:47:45.463 --> 00:47:47.932 region:rollup2
THEY GO TO SPECIALIST WHEN THAT

00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:49.767 region:rollup2
PERSON STABLE THEY COME BACK TO

00:47:47.932 --> 00:47:50.501 region:rollup2
ME. AND THAT'S WERE TRYING TO DO

00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:51.802 region:rollup2
IN METHADONE CLINICS ARE NOW

00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:52.970 region:rollup2
SEEN AS SPECIALIST IN THERE

00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:55.005 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH PRIMARY CARE

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:57.575 region:rollup2
DOCTORS. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:59.243 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF OF STE OF MILDER

00:47:57.575 --> 00:48:01.512 region:rollup2
ADDICTION TREATED IN PRIMARY

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:02.046 region:rollup2
CARE MORE SEVERE ADDICTION

00:48:01.512 --> 00:48:03.714 region:rollup2
TREATED AND AND TREATMENT

00:48:02.046 --> 00:48:04.315 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:06.050 region:rollup2
AND SO SOMETIMES WHEN I GET

00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:07.685 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGED I THINK OF THE LAST

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.919 region:rollup2
MAJOR HEALTH CRISIS WE HAD AND

00:48:07.685 --> 00:48:10.955 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT DEATH RATE

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:12.923 region:rollup2
ON THE LEFT AND WAS CLIMBING AND

00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:14.191 region:rollup2
CLIMBING IT FELT HOPELESS. BUT

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:15.760 region:rollup2
WE DROPPED THE DEATH RATE FOR

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:17.695 region:rollup2
HIV AND WE DID IT IN A VERY

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.996 region:rollup2
SIMILAR WAY TO WHAT WE NEED TO

00:48:17.695 --> 00:48:21.399 region:rollup2
DO NOW WHICH IS WE MADE.

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:23.167 region:rollup2
I'M IT IMPOSSIBLE AS A PERSON'S

00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:24.468 region:rollup2
HIV AIDS TO TO NOT GET ACCESS TO

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:25.936 region:rollup2
TREATMENT ADVOCATES AND

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:28.205 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AND AND NON PROFITS

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:30.307 region:rollup2
CAME TOGETHER TO STRIP AWAY ANY

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:31.642 region:rollup2
BARRIERS FOR FROM PEOPLE FROM

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:33.210 region:rollup2
GETTING AIDS TREATMENT THEY NEED

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:35.379 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE. EFFORT WE NEED TO.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:37.815 region:rollup2
DO HERE BECAUSE STILL THOSE MANY

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:39.617 region:rollup2
REGULATORY INSURANCE IMPRACTICAL

00:48:37.815 --> 00:48:41.352 region:rollup2
BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE GETTING

00:48:39.617 --> 00:48:43.053 region:rollup2
ADDICTION TREATMENT AND WE WON'T

00:48:41.352 --> 00:48:44.555 region:rollup2
DROPPED US INTO WE DO THAT AS

00:48:43.053 --> 00:48:45.856 region:rollup2
WELL AS REDUCING THE STATEMENTS

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:47.691 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO COME

00:48:45.856 --> 00:48:48.492 region:rollup2
FORTH. FOR TREATMENT SPEND

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:49.727 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT OF WHAT OF MEMBER

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:52.129 region:rollup2
RYAN WHITE AND MAGIC JOHNSON

00:48:49.727 --> 00:48:53.464 region:rollup2
MADE HIV FEEL MORE PERSONAL AND

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:55.166 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY WERE TRYING TO DO THE

00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:55.1000 region:rollup2
SAME THING WITH ADDICTION.

00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:57.368 region:rollup2
AND IT'S BEEN DONE BUT IT'S NOT

00:48:55.1000 --> 00:48:59.003 region:rollup2
BEEN DONE IN THIS COUNTRY WHILE

00:48:57.368 --> 00:49:00.171 region:rollup2
OUR COUNTRY DEATH RATES RISE.

00:48:59.003 --> 00:49:01.839 region:rollup2
FRANCE WAS ABLE TO DROP THEIR

00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:04.441 region:rollup2
DESPERATE EIGHTY PERCENT IN JUST

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:05.509 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS. BY MAKING

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:07.211 region:rollup2
BUPRENORPHINE TEXAS A BOX ON

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:08.512 region:rollup2
WIDELY AVAILABLE HEALTH

00:49:07.211 --> 00:49:09.747 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PLANS WERE REQUIRED TO

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:11.248 region:rollup2
PAY DOCTORS MORE TO TREAT

00:49:09.747 --> 00:49:12.817 region:rollup2
ADDICTION. THERE WAS NO SUCH

00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:14.318 region:rollup2
THING AS NEEDING WAIVERS ARE

00:49:12.817 --> 00:49:16.120 region:rollup2
GETTING DE A VISITING YOUR

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:18.722 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IT WAS MADE LIKE ANY

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.657 region:rollup2
OTHER MEDICATION VERY SIMPLE.

00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:20.791 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY ARE

00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:21.926 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A BIG WORRY WHAT

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:23.360 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WITH DIVERSION IS AND

00:49:21.926 --> 00:49:24.562 region:rollup2
FELT THE STREETS BUT TURNS OUT

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.230 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU MAKE ADDICTION

00:49:24.562 --> 00:49:27.498 region:rollup2
TREATMENT REALLY EASY TO ACCESS.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:28.365 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DON'T NEED TO BUY

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:30.234 region:rollup2
ADDICTION TREATMENT ON THE

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:32.603 region:rollup2
STREETS AND AMOUNT OF SUBOXONE

00:49:30.234 --> 00:49:34.472 region:rollup2
DIVERSION WAS VERY VERY SMALL IN

00:49:32.603 --> 00:49:35.773 region:rollup2
THE FRANCE EXPERIENCE.

00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:37.408 region:rollup2
IN ANY CASE SAM A AGAIN IT WAS

00:49:35.773 --> 00:49:38.809 region:rollup2
AN HONOR TO PRESENT IN A.

00:49:37.408 --> 00:49:40.678 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY TO

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:41.912 region:rollup2
TAKE QUESTIONS.

00:49:40.678 --> 00:49:43.347 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:45.416 region:rollup2
PFEIFFER AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:46.383 region:rollup2
IN BED NOTES THAT OF. THIS ISSUE

00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:47.485 region:rollup2
TRANSCENDS PARTISANSHIP AND IN

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:49.019 region:rollup2
FACT A NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES ON

00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:50.721 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLES HAVE

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:52.289 region:rollup2
COME HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:53.023 region:rollup2
GREAT INTEREST IN THIS EFFORT

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:55.526 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT THERE ARE

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:56.527 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY OVER TEN BILLS. OF

00:49:55.526 --> 00:49:58.128 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT HAVE BEEN

00:49:56.527 --> 00:49:59.597 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED WITH RESPECT AS YOU

00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:01.098 region:rollup2
ARE READY SO I VERY MUCH

00:49:59.597 --> 00:50:03.200 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOUR OPPOSING YOUR

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:05.803 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE ON THIS. ALSO FIRST

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.571 region:rollup2
VICE VIA A QUESTION BY A SOMEONE

00:50:05.803 --> 00:50:08.572 region:rollup2
EGGMAN.

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:09.707 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:11.775 region:rollup2
YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.

00:50:09.707 --> 00:50:13.210 region:rollup2
THE A BILL AYE IN SOME OF MY

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:15.246 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES APPEAR DID LAST YEAR

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.914 region:rollup2
WAS TOO WELL AUTHORIZED A.

00:50:15.246 --> 00:50:19.049 region:rollup2
IF INJECTION SITES

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:20.017 region:rollup2
FOR INTERVENES DRUG USE ARE IN

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:21.218 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE IT AS AS YOU

00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:23.053 region:rollup2
CLEARLY HAVE POINTED OUT

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:24.455 region:rollup2
ADDICTION IS A CONTINUUM AND IT

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:25.689 region:rollup2
STARTS ON OFFENSE AND. THAT

00:50:24.455 --> 00:50:27.291 region:rollup2
DIFFEREN POINTS THE CONTINUUM

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:29.994 region:rollup2
THERE NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENT.

00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:31.795 region:rollup2
MODALITIES OFFERED AND OR AS

00:50:29.994 --> 00:50:33.764 region:rollup2
AND AS WE CONTINUE TO TO FOCUS

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:35.533 region:rollup2
ON HARM REDUCTION IN PREVENTING

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:37.001 region:rollup2
OVERDOSES.

00:50:35.533 --> 00:50:38.202 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN GET ALL THE WAY

00:50:37.001 --> 00:50:39.970 region:rollup2
THROUGH WHERE WE'RE STILL IN

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:40.871 region:rollup2
MOTION ON THAT BILL BUT I THINK

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:42.840 region:rollup2
I'VE BROUGH THIS MORNING SAN

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:43.507 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO IS GOING TO GO AHEAD

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.575 region:rollup2
AND START ONE.

00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:45.943 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY WE HAVE A

00:50:44.575 --> 00:50:47.478 region:rollup2
CONCEPTUALIZES I WOULD GO TO

00:50:45.943 --> 00:50:48.946 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH IT WOULD BE

00:50:47.478 --> 00:50:50.714 region:rollup2
THAT A COMMUNITY COLLABORATION

00:50:48.946 --> 00:50:52.449 region:rollup2
AND THE SITES WHERE IT WOULD BE

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:53.817 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD BE MOST SAFE AND AS

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:55.319 region:rollup2
YOU POINTED OUT. THAT WOULD ONLY

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:57.087 region:rollup2
BE SET IN A IN THE AREA WHERE

00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:58.756 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY USING

00:50:57.087 --> 00:51:00.024 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY UP ON THE STREETS AND

00:50:58.756 --> 00:51:01.392 region:rollup2
OVERDOSING AND I'M JUST

00:51:00.024 --> 00:51:03.627 region:rollup2
WONDERING WHO ARE YOUR THOUGHTS

00:51:01.392 --> 00:51:04.528 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THE SYSTEMS LIKE THIS AND

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:06.697 region:rollup2
WE KNOW IT'S WORKED AND OTHER

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:10.000 region:rollup2
PLACES IN THE WORLD AND YOUR

00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:12.703 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS ABOUT IT HERE.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.271 region:rollup2
WHO OF?

00:51:12.703 --> 00:51:15.873 region:rollup2
SURE I AM I AM I CAN'T COME IN

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:17.308 region:rollup2
ENACTED LEGISLATION BUT I CAN

00:51:15.873 --> 00:51:18.642 region:rollup2
SAY THAT IF I'M HARM REDUCTION

00:51:17.308 --> 00:51:19.843 region:rollup2
IS THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT ANY

00:51:18.642 --> 00:51:21.612 region:rollup2
CRIED DISEASE IF I HAVE A

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:22.780 region:rollup2
DIABETIC AND THEN THEY BINGE ON

00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:23.847 region:rollup2
KRISPY KREME'S I TREAT THEM IN

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.949 region:rollup2
THE YEAR I DON'T JUDGE THEM. I

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:26.250 region:rollup2
ACCEPT THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF

00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:27.685 region:rollup2
DIABETICS ARE CONTROLLED AND THE

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.252 region:rollup2
OTHERS STRUGGLE AND I'M I THINK

00:51:27.685 --> 00:51:30.120 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ADAPT THAT SAME

00:51:28.252 --> 00:51:30.588 region:rollup2
METHOD FOR ADDICTION REALIZING

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.922 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CONTINUUM OF

00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:33.457 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS.

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:35.392 region:rollup2
THERE'S PERFECTION WHICH VERY

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:36.226 region:rollup2
FEW PEOPLE ACHIEVE AND THERE'S

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:37.828 region:rollup2
TOTAL ALL OUT ADDICTIVE

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:39.964 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS OF IN THE MIDDLE IS

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:41.498 region:rollup2
WHERE. HARM REDUCTION LIKE SAFE

00:51:39.964 --> 00:51:42.566 region:rollup2
INJECTION SITES AND NEEDLE

00:51:41.498 --> 00:51:44.435 region:rollup2
EXCHANGES AND A LOT SOME LIVE IT

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:45.569 region:rollup2
BASICALLY IS LET'S KEEP PEOPLE

00:51:44.435 --> 00:51:47.438 region:rollup2
ALIVE UNTIL THEY'RE READY FOR

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:49.473 region:rollup2
RECOVERY. BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY

00:51:47.438 --> 00:51:52.543 region:rollup2
WAS READY FOR RECOVERY RIGHT

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:53.043 region:rollup2
AWAY AND THAT EVERYBODY'S

00:51:52.543 --> 00:51:53.944 region:rollup2
PERFECT WHEN THEY ENTER

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.878 region:rollup2
RECOVERY.

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:55.980 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD JUST ADD THAT HARM

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:57.147 region:rollup2
REDUCTION STRATEGIES LIKE NEEDLE

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.649 region:rollup2
EXCHANGE LIKE SAFE INJECTION

00:51:57.147 --> 00:52:00.050 region:rollup2
SITES HAVE ADDED BENEFITS AS

00:51:58.649 --> 00:52:01.352 region:rollup2
WELL IN THAT THEY PROVIDE AN

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.954 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT

00:52:01.352 --> 00:52:06.357 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE USING. WITH

00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:08.359 region:rollup2
OTHER SERVICES TO EDUCATE THEM

00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:09.493 region:rollup2
IN A FRIENDLIER ENVIRONMENT THAN

00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:11.495 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTS THAT

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:12.930 region:rollup2
THEY COME INTO BUT ALSO

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:17.167 region:rollup2
PROVIDING CLEAN.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:18.102 region:rollup2
SYRINGES AT HAVE AND WELL

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:19.737 region:rollup2
PROVIDING CLEAN SYRINGES HELPS

00:52:18.102 --> 00:52:20.604 region:rollup2
US REDUCE RATES OF TRANSMISSION

00:52:19.737 --> 00:52:22.139 region:rollup2
OF HIV AND OTHER BLOOD BORNE

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:23.540 region:rollup2
DISEASES LIKE HEPATITIS C. WHICH

00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:25.075 region:rollup2
IS EPIDEMIC THROUGHOUT.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:27.344 region:rollup2
ON THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:29.646 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA I'M AND THEN FINALLY

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:31.515 region:rollup2
THE READY PROVISION OF NALOXONE

00:52:29.646 --> 00:52:33.684 region:rollup2
IN AN INDIVIDUAL SITE AND CAN

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:35.719 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY CONCEIVE OF FOLKS

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:37.688 region:rollup2
FROM AND RECOGNIZED FENTON ALL.

INJECTIONS AND SAVE LIVES ON THE

00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:41.191 region:rollup2
SPOT. IN THROUGH NEEDLE

00:52:39.023 --> 00:52:42.059 region:rollup2
EXCHANGES NALOXONE IS WE'RE

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:43.560 region:rollup2
PRETTY THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:45.696 region:rollup2
THE MAJOR VENUES THAT WE'RE

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:47.564 region:rollup2
USING TO GET NALOXONE OUT TO THE

00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:49.366 region:rollup2
USER COMMUNITY AS WELL.

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:49.967 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO SO YOU MEAN THAT

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:51.035 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN SOMEONE WOULD CALL

00:52:49.967 --> 00:52:52.936 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN THEY WOULD START THAT

00:52:51.035 --> 00:52:54.371 region:rollup2
THAT CARRYING SUPPORT OF NON

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:56.273 region:rollup2
JUDGMENTAL RELATIONSHIP THEY MAY

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:57.708 region:rollup2
ALSO THEN LOOK AT ISSUES AROUND

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:59.576 region:rollup2
HOUSING AROUND TREATING AN

00:52:57.708 --> 00:53:01.311 region:rollup2
ABSCESS AROUND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:03.047 region:rollup2
AROUND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. OTHER

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:03.580 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT MAY IMPACT THEIR

00:53:03.047 --> 00:53:04.648 region:rollup2
LIFE BECAUSE OF THIS YEAR

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.749 region:rollup2
DEBATE.

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:08.052 region:rollup2
AND ADDICTION THEY COULD ALSO

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:08.652 region:rollup2
THEM BECOME A BEGIN GETTING

00:53:08.052 --> 00:53:10.220 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FOR THOSE KINDS OF

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:12.289 region:rollup2
THINGS TO. THAT STANDARD

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.791 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN IN SYRINGE EXCHANGE

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:15.392 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS RIGHT THERE AND IF THEY

00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:16.593 region:rollup2
BECOME ALMOST A COMMUNITY HOW

00:53:15.392 --> 00:53:18.929 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE POSITIVE SENSE AS

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:19.530 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO KIND OF THE THE

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:21.065 region:rollup2
VISION THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:23.200 region:rollup2
HOUSES.

00:53:21.065 --> 00:53:23.801 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.869 region:rollup2
YOUR EDUCATION FOR MYSELF AND

00:53:23.801 --> 00:53:26.837 region:rollup2
ALL MY COLLEAGUES.

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:28.739 region:rollup2
AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THE BOOK

00:53:26.837 --> 00:53:29.973 region:rollup2
BILL FORWARD.

00:53:28.739 --> 00:53:31.775 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO QUITE ILLUSTRATIVE.

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:33.310 region:rollup2
TO SEE THEIR PRESENTATION KEY

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:34.511 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS WITH RESPECT POTENTIAL

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.113 region:rollup2
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:37.414 region:rollup2
ALSO SEEN TOO SO THERE ARE SOME

00:53:36.113 --> 00:53:39.016 region:rollup2
SIMILARITIES MOST CERTAINLY.

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:40.017 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON.

00:53:39.016 --> 00:53:41.452 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS CHAIRMAN

00:53:40.017 --> 00:53:43.187 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

00:53:41.452 --> 00:53:45.155 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION IT WAS QUITE

00:53:43.187 --> 00:53:46.957 region:rollup2
ENLIGHTENING CAN TALK ABOUT THE

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:48.459 region:rollup2
RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT EXIST

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:50.661 region:rollup2
AND. POINTING THOSE RACIAL

00:53:48.459 --> 00:53:52.930 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES OUT AND ALSO YOU

00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:53.630 region:rollup2
MADE MENTION OF THE FRANCE

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:54.631 region:rollup2
FRANCE SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:57.768 region:rollup2
GETTING A RIDE WHAT ARE WE DOING

00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:59.169 region:rollup2
GETTING A RAW.

00:53:57.768 --> 00:54:00.471 region:rollup2
SO I AM THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:01.472 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGES THAT THE PUBLIC

00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:02.773 region:rollup2
HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS A

00:54:01.472 --> 00:54:05.709 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN

00:54:02.773 --> 00:54:07.044 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED AS A WHITE EPIDEMIC IN

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:08.479 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND.

00:54:07.044 --> 00:54:10.514 region:rollup2
THE WAY I'M ALL OF US HAVE BEEN

00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:11.548 region:rollup2
WORKING ON IS THIS IS THAT EVEN

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:12.683 region:rollup2
THOUGH THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BEEN

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:14.985 region:rollup2
PORTRAYED IN THAT CERTAINLY.

00:54:12.683 --> 00:54:16.420 region:rollup2
HIDES THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:18.822 region:rollup2
HUGE INEQUITIES.

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:21.024 region:rollup2
FOR OTHER RACIAL GROUPS IN THE

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:22.493 region:rollup2
PAST WE'VE BEEN MAINLY FOCUSING

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:23.594 region:rollup2
ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:54:22.493 --> 00:54:25.329 region:rollup2
CRIMINALIZATION AND NOW THIS

00:54:23.594 --> 00:54:26.964 region:rollup2
WHITE AT EPIDEMIC IT SEEMS MORE

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:28.665 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON TREATMENT BUT. OUR

00:54:26.964 --> 00:54:29.700 region:rollup2
POINT OF VIEW IS THAT IS THAT AS

00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:30.634 region:rollup2
THE MONEY AND THE ATTENTION IS

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.136 region:rollup2
COMING AND LET USE THAT

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:33.937 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE

00:54:32.136 --> 00:54:35.773 region:rollup2
STANDARDS OF CARE FOR PEOPLE. OF

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:37.074 region:rollup2
ALL RACES AND ETHNICITIES AT ALL

00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:38.442 region:rollup2
TYPES OF ADDICTION.

00:54:37.074 --> 00:54:40.277 region:rollup2
GETTING BACK TO THE DASHBOARD

00:54:38.442 --> 00:54:41.645 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:42.112 region:rollup2
THERE'S THREE TIMES THE DEATH

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:43.847 region:rollup2
RATES.

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:46.116 region:rollup2
FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THERE

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:47.451 region:rollup2
ARE FOR WEIGHTS FROM OPIOID

00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:49.019 region:rollup2
OVERDOSE SO WE IN OUR URBAN

00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:50.420 region:rollup2
AREAS IS NOT A WHITE EPIDEMIC

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:52.523 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.791 region:rollup2
AS WE BUILD THESE NEW.

00:54:52.523 --> 00:54:56.760 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES OF ADDICTION

00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:59.730 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO

00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:00.197 region:rollup2
IT AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT WAYS

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:02.332 region:rollup2
THAT REACH OUT TO ALL

00:55:00.197 --> 00:55:03.167 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:03.801 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD I JUST SECOND THAT

00:55:03.167 --> 00:55:04.768 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR THE ISSUE OF LOOKING

00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:05.636 region:rollup2
AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:06.737 region:rollup2
THIS EPIDEMIC AND AND IN TRUTH

00:55:05.636 --> 00:55:07.738 region:rollup2
ALL DRUG USE IS VERY DIFFERENT

00:55:06.737 --> 00:55:08.305 region:rollup2
FROM PLACE TO PLACE.

00:55:07.738 --> 00:55:10.207 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT'S THE

00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:12.109 region:rollup2
REASON THAT WERE FOCUSING ON

00:55:10.207 --> 00:55:14.745 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT ADDRESS THE

00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:16.313 region:rollup2
OPIOID EPIDEMIC BUT ALSO GENERIC

00:55:14.745 --> 00:55:18.682 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THE DECK ADDRESS ALL

00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:20.250 region:rollup2
ADDICTION IS THAT. WE CONTINUE

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:22.152 region:rollup2
TO SEE INCREASES IT FOR EXAMPLE

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.921 region:rollup2
IN METHADONE AND I'M SORRY

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:25.722 region:rollup2
METHAMPHETAMINE OVERDOSES. ARE

00:55:23.921 --> 00:55:27.357 region:rollup2
GOING UP AND THAT'S TRUE IN MANY

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:28.592 region:rollup2
OF THE SAME PARTS OF THE STATE

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:30.894 region:rollup2
OF THE CALIFORNIA THAT.

00:55:28.592 --> 00:55:32.529 region:rollup2
OPIATES ARE THE APPROACHES

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:34.398 region:rollup2
AROUND SAFE PRESCRIBING AT ITS

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.965 region:rollup2
CENTER THAT OBVIOUSLY ISN'T

00:55:34.398 --> 00:55:35.866 region:rollup2
RELEVANT TO THAT PARTICULAR

00:55:34.965 --> 00:55:36.934 region:rollup2
DRUG.

00:55:35.866 --> 00:55:38.869 region:rollup2
OR EVEN TO SOMETHING LIKE

00:55:36.934 --> 00:55:40.537 region:rollup2
ALCOHOLISM WHICH BY THE WAY IS

00:55:38.869 --> 00:55:42.472 region:rollup2
STILL THE SINGLE LARGEST DRUG OF

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:44.208 region:rollup2
ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES AND

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:46.543 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE'RE TRYING

00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:48.845 region:rollup2
TO MAKE ONCE WE MAY WE IF WE CAN

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:50.380 region:rollup2
NORMALIZE ADDICTION AS A DISEASE

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:51.448 region:rollup2
AND THE PROVISION OF ADDICTION

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.350 region:rollup2
TREATMENT AS SOMETHING OF COURSE

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:55.485 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD DO. THAT I THINK WE

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:57.087 region:rollup2
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:59.089 region:rollup2
OUR SOCIETY AND A LOT OF

00:55:57.087 --> 00:56:00.557 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AREAS.

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:02.326 region:rollup2
MAYBE I MISSED SOMETHING SO ARE

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:03.093 region:rollup2
DID YOU SAY THAT AFRICAN

00:56:02.326 --> 00:56:05.128 region:rollup2
AMERICANS.

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:07.397 region:rollup2
HAS TO RECEIVE IS THREE TIMES

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:09.099 region:rollup2
HIGHER. IN SAN FRANCISCO THAN

00:56:07.397 --> 00:56:10.801 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER ETHNICITY AND NATIVE

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:12.803 region:rollup2
AMERICANS HAVE THE HIGHEST DEATH

00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:14.471 region:rollup2
RATE ACROSS THE STATE. YEAH SO

00:56:12.803 --> 00:56:16.874 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT WHERE THE RESOURCES

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:17.407 region:rollup2
GOING IN THOSE THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:19.476 region:rollup2
THE TARGET THAT PARTICULAR

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:20.410 region:rollup2
ETHNICITY.

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:22.613 region:rollup2
THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.914 region:rollup2
REASONS WE ARE WORKING SO

00:56:22.613 --> 00:56:24.982 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY IN AND HELP EIGHT

00:56:23.914 --> 00:56:26.650 region:rollup2

ABOUT EXACTLY WHERE PARTICULAR

00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:39.696 region:rollup2
RESOURCES SHOULD BE PLACED.

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.964 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING THAT IN

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:42.1000 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION WITH THE PEOPLE

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:44.067 region:rollup2
WHO KNOW THOSE COMMUNITIES ONE

00:56:42.1000 --> 00:56:45.369 region:rollup2
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:47.037 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE STAFF BOARD IS THAT

00:56:45.369 --> 00:56:48.472 region:rollup2
DATA IS AVAILABLE TO THE LOCAL

00:56:47.037 --> 00:56:50.274 region:rollup2

RESOURCES ARE NEEDED WHAT ARE

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:10.427 region:rollup2
THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL ISSUES

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:13.897 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO NEED TO BE A DROUGHT.

00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:14.998 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:17.768 region:rollup2
THREE MUCH

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:18.568 region:rollup2
A SUMMER GALLAGHER.

00:57:17.768 --> 00:57:20.804 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND.

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:21.805 region:rollup2
YEAH THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:22.306 region:rollup2
TO BE PART OF THE COMMITTEE THIS

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:24.141 region:rollup2
MORNING VERY IMPORTANT.

00:57:22.306 --> 00:57:26.643 region:rollup2
I ISSUE.

00:57:24.141 --> 00:57:28.345 region:rollup2
IN MY DISTRICT BUT THROUGHOUT

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:29.479 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND I THINK WE SAW LOW

00:57:28.345 --> 00:57:30.747 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS THERE.

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:31.281 region:rollup2
ONE THING I WANTED TO FOCUS IN

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:34.151 region:rollup2
ON I THINK A.

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:35.252 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE.

00:57:34.151 --> 00:57:36.820 region:rollup2
AND SO MEMBER GIPSON BROUGHT UP

00:57:35.252 --> 00:57:37.821 region:rollup2
THERE THE RACIAL. DISPARITIES

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.289 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE I THINK IS

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:42.159 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHY AND.

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:43.260 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY IMPACTING THE

00:57:42.159 --> 00:57:44.227 region:rollup2
RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE A VERY

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.797 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT WAY I THINK IF YOU

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:47.297 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THOSE.

00:57:46.797 --> 00:57:49.933 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR.

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:51.101 region:rollup2
OPIATE OF THE DASHBOARD AND IT

00:57:49.933 --> 00:57:52.736 region:rollup2
SHOWS YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE

00:57:51.101 --> 00:57:54.037 region:rollup2
RURAL COUNTIES ARE VERY HEAVILY.

00:57:52.736 --> 00:57:57.341 region:rollup2
IMPACT IN TERMS OF.

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:59.042 region:rollup2
OVERDOSES PER PER CAPITA.

00:57:57.341 --> 00:58:01.678 region:rollup2
HOSPITALIZATIONS PER CAPITA.

00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:02.612 region:rollup2
AND.

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:04.047 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:05.816 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE THING I THINK WE

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:07.818 region:rollup2
HAVE TO REALLY FOCUS IN ON IS

00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:08.452 region:rollup2
WELL AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED

00:58:07.818 --> 00:58:09.886 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED

00:58:08.452 --> 00:58:13.490 region:rollup2
WAS.

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:15.192 region:rollup2
A LACK OF SAFETY NET THE. BUT

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:17.027 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ISSUE HERE IS WE'VE.

00:58:15.192 --> 00:58:18.395 region:rollup2
YOU THAT'S THAT I CAN TELL YOU

00:58:17.027 --> 00:58:20.697 region:rollup2
ABOUT THESE AREAS IS THE.

00:58:18.395 --> 00:58:22.833 region:rollup2
DIMINISHING TIMBER MINING.

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:24.167 region:rollup2
.

00:58:22.833 --> 00:58:25.669 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACT

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:27.537 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING HAS AS THAT HAS

00:58:25.669 --> 00:58:28.005 region:rollup2
GONE AWAY. AND YOU HAVE

00:58:27.537 --> 00:58:30.874 region:rollup2
GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE

00:58:28.005 --> 00:58:34.444 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYED.

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:35.545 region:rollup2
AND TURNING TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.913 region:rollup2
EARNED THAT HAS BEEN YOU KNOW WE

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:37.914 region:rollup2
SAW THE METHAMPHETAMINE WE SAW

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:39.149 region:rollup2
THAT NOW AND NOW WITH THE OP A

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:40.584 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:42.319 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ANOTHER FACTOR YOU

00:58:40.584 --> 00:58:44.054 region:rollup2
KNOW SO.

00:58:42.319 --> 00:58:44.254 region:rollup2
BUT AND IN GETTING THAT THE YOU

00:58:44.054 --> 00:58:46.623 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:48.091 region:rollup2
.

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:49.459 region:rollup2
AND THE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.093 region:rollup2
I THINK ANOTHER THING YOU SHOWED

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:51.094 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:53.263 region:rollup2
LOCAL.

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:54.898 region:rollup2
COALITIONS THERE'S RESOURCES

00:58:53.263 --> 00:58:56.266 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:58:54.898 --> 00:58:58.035 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT IT WHERE THOSE

00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:59.669 region:rollup2
ARE AT IT'S ALMOST THE INVERSE

00:58:58.035 --> 00:59:01.004 region:rollup2
OF WHERE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:03.340 region:rollup2
ARE YOU'RE STILL SEEING A LOT OF

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:04.508 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT AREN'T COVERED.

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:06.009 region:rollup2
HOW COME YOUYOU KNOW HOW CAN WE

00:59:04.508 --> 00:59:07.544 region:rollup2
BETTER GET THAT GETTING SOME OF

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:09.546 region:rollup2
THESE RESOURCES OUT TO SOME OF

00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:10.747 region:rollup2
THE REALLY HOT SPOTS WHICH TEND

00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:11.882 region:rollup2
TO BE IN A RURAL PARTS?

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:14.151 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

00:59:11.882 --> 00:59:15.052 region:rollup2
NAM.

00:59:14.151 --> 00:59:16.386 region:rollup2
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE

00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:18.455 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT AND WHAT KIND OF

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:19.890 region:rollup2
EFFORTS HERE. BEING DONE THAT IS

00:59:18.455 --> 00:59:21.391 region:rollup2
YEAH IT'S VERY MUCH THINGS THAT

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:23.126 region:rollup2
WERE THAT WERE ARMED THAT THE

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:24.861 region:rollup2
COALITIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:59:23.126 --> 00:59:26.396 region:rollup2
IS FUNDING ARE ACTUALLY VERY

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:27.998 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY THOSE IN THESE RURAL

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:29.933 region:rollup2
AREAS SO THAT WE DON'T RUN THE

00:59:27.998 --> 00:59:32.002 region:rollup2
RISK OF A COALITION NOT HAVING A

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:32.869 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO CONTINUE. WE ALSO

00:59:32.002 --> 00:59:34.771 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME STRATEGIES THAT ARE

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:36.940 region:rollup2
VERY SPECIFIC TO THOSE RURAL

00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:38.275 region:rollup2
AREAS FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:40.110 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS THAT WE'RE

00:59:38.275 --> 00:59:41.745 region:rollup2
CREATING WERE ACTUALLY WORKING

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:42.979 region:rollup2
WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE

00:59:41.745 --> 00:59:45.048 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS SO THAT THAT

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:47.317 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN IS VERY TARGETED TO WHO

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:47.884 region:rollup2
IS AT HIGHEST RISK THERE AS

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:48.652 region:rollup2
OPPOSED OTHER PARTS. OF THE

00:59:47.884 --> 00:59:50.487 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:59:48.652 --> 00:59:52.456 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY WE ALSO ARE USING.

00:59:50.487 --> 00:59:54.825 region:rollup2
AS STRATEGY CALLED ACADEMIC

00:59:52.456 --> 00:59:55.692 region:rollup2
DETAILING WHICH IS M. IF YOU'VE

00:59:54.825 --> 00:59:56.793 region:rollup2
EVER BEEN SITTING IN YOUR

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:58.061 region:rollup2
DOCTOR'S OFFICE IN THE WAITING

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:59.396 region:rollup2
ROOM AND SOMEBODY INCREDIBLY

00:59:58.061 --> 01:00:01.064 region:rollup2
WELL DRESSED STROLLS THROUGH AND

00:59:59.396 --> 01:00:02.332 region:rollup2
GOES IMMEDIATELY TO THE BACK FOR

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:03.800 region:rollup2
A FEW YOU KNOW. AN HOUR TO THIS

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:05.068 region:rollup2
OUR DRIVE REPRESENTATIVES COMING

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.837 region:rollup2
IN TO TALK TO THEIR DOCTORS

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:08.138 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEIR LATEST DRUG THAT'S

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:09.840 region:rollup2
RELEASED IN PROVIDING THEM LOTS

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:11.575 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION ON WHAT IT'S GOOD

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.843 region:rollup2
FOR HOW TO USE IT IT CETERA.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:15.245 region:rollup2
THAT'S CALLED ACADEMIC DETAILING

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:17.180 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING USING

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:19.049 region:rollup2
SOME OF INDIVIDUALS FROM THOSE

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:21.384 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO DO ACADEMIC

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:23.620 region:rollup2
DETAILING ABOUT SAFE PRESCRIBING

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:25.989 region:rollup2
ON OPIOIDS ABOUT WHO'S AT RISK

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:27.991 region:rollup2
OF OPIATE. OVERDOSE AND REALLY

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.126 region:rollup2
ONE ON ONE WITH THE CLINICIANS

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:31.361 region:rollup2
FIRST TARGETING THOSE THAT ARE

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.829 region:rollup2
HIGHEST PRESCRIBERS USING CURES

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:35.298 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:36.233 region:rollup2
BUT THEN MOVING OUT TO ALL THE

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.101 region:rollup2
CLINICIANS.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:39.369 region:rollup2
THAT'S ON THE ON THE LEGAL

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:41.738 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION SIDE OF THE HOUSE

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:43.807 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO THE DIVERSION SIDE.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:45.142 region:rollup2
COALITIONS HAVE ENGAGED LAW

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:46.810 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AND VERY

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.043 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVELY IN THESE AREAS TO

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.578 region:rollup2
TRY TO.

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:51.014 region:rollup2
.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:52.883 region:rollup2
SHIFT THE THE FOCUS UP AWAY FROM

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:53.783 region:rollup2
CRIMINALIZATION OBVIOUSLY WITH

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:55.552 region:rollup2
THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE HEARD ARE

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:57.287 region:rollup2
DEALING DRUGS AND MORE TO.

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:57.854 region:rollup2
OTHER METHODS OF DECREASING

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:59.923 region:rollup2
DIVERSION ON THERE ARE SOME

01:00:57.854 --> 01:01:01.925 region:rollup2
VERY.

01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:04.261 region:rollup2
INTERESTING TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:05.662 region:rollup2
BEEN USED TO HELP IDENTIFY DOT

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.997 region:rollup2
DOCTORS TO HELP THEM REALIZE THE

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.931 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF A POOR

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:10.567 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING.

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:12.169 region:rollup2
THE WAY DOCTOR FIFER FOUND OUT

01:01:10.567 --> 01:01:13.003 region:rollup2
ABOUT HER AND PATIENT WAS FROM A

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.237 region:rollup2
LETTER FROM THROUGH A CORNER

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:16.239 region:rollup2
INTO SOME OF THE SAME

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:17.507 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS. ARE TAKING THAT

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:19.843 region:rollup2
KIND OF APPROACH.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:21.511 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON THE DOCTORS.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:23.947 region:rollup2
AND SO THEN THE OTHER THING

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:25.415 region:rollup2
THAT IS THIS IS WHAT WE THIS IS

01:01:23.947 --> 01:01:26.983 region:rollup2
THE GREAT HOPE I THINK OF THIS

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:28.251 region:rollup2
HUB AND SPOKE MODEL AT THAT

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:29.619 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:30.954 region:rollup2
IS PUTTING IN PLACE FOR

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:32.923 region:rollup2
MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT.

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:34.457 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUILD A CENTER

01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:36.092 region:rollup2
OF EXCELLENCE FOR ADDICTION

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:38.628 region:rollup2
THERAPY IN EVERY SINGLE SMALL

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:41.798 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WHAT YOU CAN DO IS

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:42.666 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TRAINING ON THAT WELL

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:44.734 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MOONLIGHT YOU TALK

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:45.335 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE HAVE THE ABOUT THAT

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:47.904 region:rollup2
METHOD BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE OF

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:49.606 region:rollup2
THE CLINICIAN THAT.

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:50.674 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SEE BY THESE MAPS AT

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:53.076 region:rollup2
THE RURAL AREAS WERE

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:54.444 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY FOCUSED.

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:55.312 region:rollup2
ON THE HUB AT THE HUB AND SPOKE

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:56.613 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH IS EIGHTY NINE

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:57.981 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL

01:01:56.613 --> 01:02:00.183 region:rollup2
FUNDING COMING AND TIPPED TO

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:02.352 region:rollup2
INCREASE ACCESS SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:03.753 region:rollup2
OPIOID ADDICTION. IS LARGELY

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:05.589 region:rollup2
BEING TARGET IN THE RURAL AREAS

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:06.756 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THE HARDEST HIT AND

01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:08.725 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SPECIAL PART OF THAT

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:10.927 region:rollup2
IS ALSO FOCUSED ON THE NATIVE

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:12.295 region:rollup2
AMERICAN POPULATION. AND AGAIN

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:14.164 region:rollup2
THE AT THE IDEAS AS A PRIMARY

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:15.231 region:rollup2
CARE DOC AND NEVER WAS TRAINED

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:16.700 region:rollup2
IN ADDICTION IT'S VERY

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:18.435 region:rollup2
INTIMIDATING TO THINK ABOUT.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.569 region:rollup2
STARTING THIS WHOLE NEW PRACTICE

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:21.404 region:rollup2
WITH SOMETHING I DON'T

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.672 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY WITH IT

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:24.507 region:rollup2
THE A LOT OF TAX FEEL WHAT

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:25.542 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF STIGMA WHAT IF

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:26.676 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE SHOW UP IN MY

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:28.111 region:rollup2
WAITING ROOM IN MY OTHER

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:30.580 region:rollup2
PATIENTS DON'T LIKE IT OR. OR.

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:31.948 region:rollup2
IT HELPS TO HAVE SENT A COACH

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.249 region:rollup2
OR MENTOR IN THAT THE WAY I

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:35.251 region:rollup2
STARTED BACK IN THE EARLY TWO

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:36.119 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS WAS. FINDING A FRIEND

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:37.721 region:rollup2
WHO'D DONE IT AND HAVE AND

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:38.989 region:rollup2
TALKING THROUGH MY FIRST FEW

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:41.625 region:rollup2
CASES AND AGAIN WE WERE FINDING

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:42.626 region:rollup2
IT MORE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS.

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:44.060 region:rollup2
NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:45.528 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AND DOCTORS

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:48.198 region:rollup2
ARE WILLING TO STEP UP TO TREAT

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:51.134 region:rollup2
ADDICTION. IF THEY'RE NOT ALONE

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:54.738 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:55.839 region:rollup2
A SPECIALIST TO GET HELP THROUGH

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:57.007 region:rollup2
THOSE FIRST FEW CASES.

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.408 region:rollup2
MOST OF US FIND THAT AFTER THE

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:59.209 region:rollup2
FIRST THREE WE SAY THIS WASN'T A

01:02:58.408 --> 01:03:00.644 region:rollup2
BIG DEAL I DON'T KNOW WHY I WAS

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.878 region:rollup2
SO WORRIED IT'S IS A GREAT ANTI

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:03.380 region:rollup2
BURNOUT METHOD BECAUSE YOU SEE

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:04.848 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GO FROM CHAOS. TO

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.616 region:rollup2
RECOVERY IT IS INCREDIBLY

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:07.417 region:rollup2
REWARDING AS A DOCTOR WHEN MOST

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.018 region:rollup2
OF OUR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:10.854 region:rollup2
DISEASES JUST GET WORSE OVER

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:11.888 region:rollup2
TIME. SO AGAIN THE IDEA IS THAT.

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:13.456 region:rollup2
THESE UMPTEEN PREVIOUSLY CALLED

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:15.392 region:rollup2
METHADONE CLINICS WILL BECOME

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:17.794 region:rollup2
THE DEBT THOSE RESOURCES AND

01:03:15.392 --> 01:03:19.596 region:rollup2
HELP RURAL AREAS WITHOUT.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:21.064 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST TREATMENT PROGRAMS

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:22.565 region:rollup2
BUILD THE CONFIDENCE OF THOSE

01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:24.200 region:rollup2
LOCAL CLINICIANS TO BE ABLE TO

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:25.068 region:rollup2
TREAT ADDICTION AND CAN CREATE

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.871 region:rollup2
THIS NETWORK OF OF MUTUAL

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:30.006 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:33.043 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE CHALLENGE ALSO FOR.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:35.278 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS AS WITH EVERY EVERY

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:36.946 region:rollup2
OTHER ASPECT OF HEALTH CARE AND

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:38.281 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF ACCESS TO IT IN THE

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:40.450 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS.

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:42.118 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:42.719 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES TO OPIOID SO AND

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:44.954 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS ARE. THINGS EVEN

01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:46.289 region:rollup2
IN.

01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:47.857 region:rollup2
MORE POPULOUS AREAS CAN BE

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:49.726 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO COME BY THINGS LIKE

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:50.994 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL THERAPY.

01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:53.730 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:55.165 region:rollup2
ACUPUNCTURE ETCETERA TO

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:56.566 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY HEALTH PLANS ARE

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.901 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT THEY NEED TO

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:59.035 region:rollup2
COVER THESE SERVICES

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.737 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT HAVE A

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:02.372 region:rollup2
GOOD EVIDENCE BASED BUT GETTING%

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:04.607 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THAT IN THE RURAL

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:05.942 region:rollup2
AREAS IS REALLY CHALLENGING.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:07.444 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE THEN.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:08.578 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE THING

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:11.247 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ABOUT REMAIN SOMETHING

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:12.382 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO WORK HARD ON.

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:14.317 region:rollup2
NO THANK YOU FOR THAT I MEAN

01:04:12.382 --> 01:04:16.720 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LOT A LOT THERE.

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:18.555 region:rollup2
I'D I THINK THERE ARE SOME GOOD

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.490 region:rollup2
THINGS IN PLACE THAT ARE TRYING

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:21.124 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THIS BUT I WOULD.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.192 region:rollup2
HAVE MY COLLEAGUES JUST LOOK AT

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:23.693 region:rollup2
THAT MAP.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.861 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:26.363 region:rollup2
GRAY AREA THERE AND THOSE GRAY

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:29.165 region:rollup2
AREAS.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:30.667 region:rollup2
OUR RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE.

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:32.669 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:33.636 region:rollup2
DO ITS IT'S YOU KNOW THE EVEN

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:34.771 region:rollup2
THOUGH THERE ARE THINGS IN PLACE

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:36.606 region:rollup2
IN NOT SAYING THERE'S NOT HAVE

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:38.141 region:rollup2
BEEN SPOKE ALL THOSE.

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:40.510 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S GONNA TAKE

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:43.446 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO DO IT AND.

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:44.814 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE.

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:46.783 region:rollup2
FOR HELPING TO CREATE THIS

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:48.585 region:rollup2
EPIDEMIC NEED TO BE.

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:52.856 region:rollup2
PARTNERS IN IN HELPING US TO

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:57.026 region:rollup2
PULL THE RESOURCES TO GET THERE.

YEARS OF GENERAL PRACTITIONER.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:32.929 region:rollup2
WHO WORKS A ROTATION IN AN

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.997 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOM?

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:36.232 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY HOSPITAL FOR A

01:05:33.997 --> 01:05:38.034 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILES.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:40.003 region:rollup2
THAT HAS A FULL TIME EMERGENCY

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:41.771 region:rollup2
ROOM AND SO. I SPENT A LOT OF

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:43.306 region:rollup2
TIME WITH HIM.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:45.775 region:rollup2
A TALKING ABOUT HEALTHCARE

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:47.877 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN RULE CALIFORNIA AS WE

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:49.946 region:rollup2
HAVE WE HAVE THE EIGHTY RURAL

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:51.147 region:rollup2
HEALTH CLINIC IN. MY COMMUNITY

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:53.149 region:rollup2
WHERE HE WORKS DURING THE DAY

AND DOES THE ARE IN THE EVENINGS

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:56.753 region:rollup2
AND AND ROTATE SO WE HAVE. A

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:57.821 region:rollup2
VERY A.

01:05:56.753 --> 01:06:00.223 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO GET

01:05:57.821 --> 01:06:01.991 region:rollup2
DOC'S EVEN LIVE IN OUR AREAS

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:03.293 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE SO WE HAVE A ROTATION

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.994 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COME IN AND ACTUALLY WORK

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:07.197 region:rollup2
OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND THEN GO

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:07.597 region:rollup2
BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:09.399 region:rollup2
SO.

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:10.600 region:rollup2
I WANTED IT'S I HAVE SOME

01:06:09.399 --> 01:06:11.734 region:rollup2
THINGS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.203 region:rollup2
AND THEN I'M AND HOUSE QUESTION

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:14.838 region:rollup2
AT THE END SO NUMBER ONE WE AT

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:16.005 region:rollup2
THIS I ASK HIM. THE FOLKS THAT

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:17.874 region:rollup2
COME THROUGH THE EMERGENCY ROOM

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:19.876 region:rollup2
WHO ARE SO WE CALM WE WE DID A

01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:21.411 region:rollup2
BILL LAST THING WAS LAST YEAR.

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:23.546 region:rollup2
THAT SENATOR LARA CARED A BILL

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:25.748 region:rollup2
ON.

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:27.050 region:rollup2
OR NOT TRYING TO IDENTIFY A CURE

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:28.485 region:rollup2
IT CURES DATABASE PAISLEY TRYING

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:30.153 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO IDENTIFY.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.588 region:rollup2
AND AND TRACK.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.622 region:rollup2
BUT THE POINT IS IS THAT A THIRD

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:34.624 region:rollup2
OF THE FOLKS THAT COME THROUGH

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:36.025 region:rollup2
THE MERGER ZERO. NO THEY SWAP

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:38.461 region:rollup2
THEM NOW SO THEY CAN FIND OUT

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:41.197 region:rollup2
WHAT OTHER IPS LOTTIE'S FOLKS

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:42.665 region:rollup2
RUN OTHER DRUGS IN AND. TRY NOT

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.900 region:rollup2
TO. KEEP THEM FROM ODEON

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:46.369 region:rollup2
BASICALLY BUT A THIRD OF THE

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.003 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT COME THROUGH HABIT

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:47.971 region:rollup2
NOT THEIR PRESCRIPTION IN THEIR

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.738 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:50.306 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE GETTING THAT AND

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:52.108 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TAKING IT OUT AND IT'S A

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:53.643 region:rollup2
BUSINESS MACY'S A BUSINESS MODEL

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:55.845 region:rollup2
SO USE NOT TO CELLS NUMBER ONE.

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:57.046 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO THIS DISCOVERY MIGHT

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.981 region:rollup2
BE IF I WAS.

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.682 region:rollup2
I KEEP GREW UP DURING THE

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:02.051 region:rollup2
EIGHTIES WHEN WE WHEN COCAINE

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:04.387 region:rollup2
WAS LIKE THE THE. RICH PERSON'S

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:05.522 region:rollup2
DRUG AND THEN YOU RECALL CRACK

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:07.657 region:rollup2
CAME OUT AND THAT WAS A LOWER

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:08.224 region:rollup2
LEVEL TO WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS AB

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:10.059 region:rollup2
OPIOID WHICH IS A WHICH IS

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:12.362 region:rollup2
BASICALLY A RICH PERSON'S.

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:13.796 region:rollup2
CHOICE AND THEN WILL NOT GETS

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.764 region:rollup2
CUT OFF THEY GO TO THE CHEAP

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:16.766 region:rollup2
VERSION WHICH IS NOW ON.

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:18.201 region:rollup2
HEROIN.

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.601 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.670 region:rollup2
OUR OVERDOSES SO.

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:22.038 region:rollup2
.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:23.606 region:rollup2
I MEAN ASK WHAT WHAT IT WILL IT

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:26.042 region:rollup2
IN INDIVIDUAL AREAS WHERE WE

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:27.744 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY FEW LITTLE SERVICES

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:29.145 region:rollup2
AND MANY MANY MILES TO TRAVEL TO

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:30.046 region:rollup2
GET TO THOSE SERVICES IN MANY

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:31.548 region:rollup2
CASES.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.949 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS A GREAT

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.449 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE THING

01:07:32.949 --> 01:07:34.751 region:rollup2
THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:36.352 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WISE BECAUSE AT THE

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:38.254 region:rollup2
END OF THE DAY WE BASS THAT

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.855 region:rollup2
EDUCATE THESE FOLKS ON? WHICH

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:41.758 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM THEY WANTED HER

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:43.726 region:rollup2
SURGERY. GOT ADDICTED AFTER WORK

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:45.028 region:rollup2
AFTER THEIR. SURGERY AND THEN

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:46.563 region:rollup2
THERE'D THERE'D CUT OFF AND THEN

01:07:45.028 --> 01:07:47.864 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO A CHEAPER

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:50.199 region:rollup2
VERSION OF SOMETHING TO MANAGE

01:07:47.864 --> 01:07:51.968 region:rollup2
THEIR ADDICTION. A AND OVER AND

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:54.404 region:rollup2
OVER DISTANCES ARE ONE THING

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:55.939 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD FOCUS ON IN THOSE.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:57.874 region:rollup2
ROLE AREAS OR.

01:07:55.939 --> 01:07:59.042 region:rollup2
MAYBE TO THAT WE THINK WOULD BE.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:08:01.844 region:rollup2
HELPFUL IN GETTING STARTED ON

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:02.011 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATION PROCESS.

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:04.247 region:rollup2
SO.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:05.448 region:rollup2
.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:06.649 region:rollup2
WHEN THE TARGET IS THE GENERAL

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:08.418 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND IN PARTICULAR THE THE

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:10.186 region:rollup2
USERS.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
IT IN GENERAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:14.424 region:rollup2
THE BEST APPROACH TO THAT IS TO

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:15.625 region:rollup2
FIND TRUSTED SPOKESPEOPLE SO WHO

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:17.827 region:rollup2
IS IT THAT THOSE FOLKS REALLY

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:19.862 region:rollup2
LOOK TO FOR GOOD INFORMATION.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:20.930 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FOR EACH.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:21.831 region:rollup2
PLACE IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.999 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND FOR EACH

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:25.001 region:rollup2
POPULATION IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:26.302 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND THEN PROVIDING

01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:27.770 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE REALLY GOOD

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:28.404 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN THEN

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.405 region:rollup2
PASS ON IS ONE OF THE THINGS

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.140 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:32.775 region:rollup2
WE DO WITH OUR SYRINGE EXCHANGE

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.677 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WE.

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:36.446 region:rollup2
PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR IS TO

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:37.547 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE IN

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.749 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAMS AND REALLY

01:08:37.547 --> 01:08:41.017 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:43.519 region:rollup2
OPIATES THE TRANSITION FROM

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:46.489 region:rollup2
OPIATES TO HEROIN ET CETERA. SO

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:48.124 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN TALK AS PEERS.

01:08:46.489 --> 01:08:50.393 region:rollup2
AND AS TRUSTED.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:52.061 region:rollup2
PURVEYORS INFORMATION TO THE

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:53.596 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS AND SO THAT THAT'S

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:55.198 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SO MUCH

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:56.632 region:rollup2
OF OUR EFFORT AND RESOURCES ARE

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:57.367 region:rollup2
GOING TO SUPPORTING THESE LOCAL

01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:59.335 region:rollup2
OPIOID.

01:08:57.367 --> 01:09:00.570 region:rollup2
COALITIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.738 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO LIVE IN THESE

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:03.473 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES SERVE THESE

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:05.808 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND HOPEFULLY CAN

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:07.477 region:rollup2
HELP IDENTIFY WHO ARE THE PEOPLE

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.978 region:rollup2
WHO ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:09.445 region:rollup2
THOSE MESSAGES IN A WAY THAT

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.546 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE HEARD AND

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:12.081 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD.

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:14.083 region:rollup2
AND HONESTLY YOU JUST HAVE TO DO

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:15.852 region:rollup2
IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:18.221 region:rollup2
COMBINE IT WITH ACCESS TO

01:09:15.852 --> 01:09:19.655 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS. THAT ARE AVAILABLE

01:09:18.221 --> 01:09:21.090 region:rollup2
WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE READY.

01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:22.125 region:rollup2
AB BECAUSE THAT IS A HUGE PART

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:25.261 region:rollup2
OF WHAT PREDICT SUCCESS IN

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:29.165 region:rollup2
RECOVERY.

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:31.000 region:rollup2
SO FOLLOW UP TO THAT AM.

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.968 region:rollup2
I WAS RAISED WITH OF A FATHER

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.735 region:rollup2
WHO WAS AN ALCOHOLIC IN BACK

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:34.170 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE WAS NO TREATMENT

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:36.205 region:rollup2
CENTERS AVAILABLE.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:38.174 region:rollup2
AND YOU WE DIDN'T DEAL FIRST

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:39.876 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THERE'S A PROBLEM YET

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.476 region:rollup2
TO THE THAT THE DEBT THAT PERSON

01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:42.445 region:rollup2
WHO'S ADDICTED JUSTICE HAVE A

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:44.414 region:rollup2
PROBLEMWHICH WAS NOT POPULAR

01:09:42.445 --> 01:09:45.915 region:rollup2
BACK INTO BETTY FORD ACTUALLY

01:09:44.414 --> 01:09:48.918 region:rollup2
CAME OUT AND SAID HEY ALCOHOL

AND. ISM IS IS A DISEASE.

01:09:48.918 --> 01:09:52.355 region:rollup2
AND SO SAME THING IN THIS IN

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:53.856 region:rollup2
THIS WORLD WHERE IS THIRTY YEARS

01:09:52.355 --> 01:09:55.391 region:rollup2
FORWARD FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.592 region:rollup2

I. THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHERE

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:04.033 region:rollup2
WE'RE AT NOW.

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:05.835 region:rollup2

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.843 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE THAT TO THEM AND

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.377 region:rollup2
HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM TO GO.

01:10:13.843 --> 01:10:17.380 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S A TREATMENT

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:18.915 region:rollup2
CENTER?

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.816 region:rollup2
AND IF I COULD BUILD ANNA AND

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:21.084 region:rollup2
OTHER SMIS COMMENTS IN THE RURAL

01:12:43.626 --> 01:12:48.130 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO PHYSICIANS. ARE

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:49.632 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WHO ARE OF PRACTICING.

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:52.301 region:rollup2
AND I COULD SEE THE SAME THING

01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:54.770 region:rollup2
WITH THE OPIOID ISSUE.

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:56.672 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WOULD IT TAKE.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:58.507 region:rollup2
I EFFORTS TO HAVE THE MEDICAL

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:59.942 region:rollup2
BOARD GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE

RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:02.745 region:rollup2
INCREASING. YOU KNOW

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:04.247 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATIONS FOR SOME BOX ON

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:05.948 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:06.849 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COULD

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:10.620 region:rollup2
REALLY HELP RURAL AREAS

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:11.387 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.555 region:rollup2

THEY'VE REALLY BEEN AT THE FRONT

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.807 region:rollup2
EDGE ON THIS SO.

01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:32.642 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S GOTTEN ON THE.

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:33.676 region:rollup2
.

WHERE TO THE PHARMACISTS

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:43.352 region:rollup2
FIT INTO THAT ARE THEY PART OF

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.453 region:rollup2
THAT AND?

FOUNDING MEMBER HERBERT GROUP.

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:51.827 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE POLICY CHANGES THAT.

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:53.996 region:rollup2
WENT INTO EFFECT BECAUSE OF THE

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:55.398 region:rollup2
WORKING OF THE BOARD OF PHARMACY

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:58.200 region:rollup2
HAVE REALLY DRAMATICALLY.

01:13:55.398 --> 01:13:59.302 region:rollup2
INCREASED ACCESS TO FOR EXAMPLE

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.137 region:rollup2
THE LOCKS AND.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.904 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION AND AND

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:03.606 region:rollup2
AGAIN I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THEM

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:05.741 region:rollup2
TO TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS FOR

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:06.909 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:09.011 region:rollup2
PALM AND JUST LAST REALLY

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:10.446 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY ARM ONE OF THE THINGS

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:11.280 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IS TRYING

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:14.517 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:17.586 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBER REIMBURSEMENT FOR.

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:20.289 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS WHO BECOME CERTIFIED.

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:20.756 region:rollup2
ARE TO TREAT WITH SUBOXONE.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.958 region:rollup2
AND THE.

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:24.760 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT AND THE WAY IT

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:26.829 region:rollup2
OPERATES HAVING MOTIVATED.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.664 region:rollup2
.

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:31.100 region:rollup2
MOST PATIENTS WHO REALLY WANT TO

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:32.968 region:rollup2
GET OFF THE DRUGS AND HAVE USING

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.637 region:rollup2
TELEHEALTH AND ABILITIES TO.

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:35.638 region:rollup2
HARM HAVE A PRESCRIPTION CAN

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:36.439 region:rollup2
REALLY HELP PEOPLE IN RURAL

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.341 region:rollup2
AREAS.

01:14:36.439 --> 01:14:39.809 region:rollup2
.

01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:40.943 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:42.545 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:43.813 region:rollup2
BCAUSE WE HAVE. ACCORDING THE

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:45.281 region:rollup2
THE DATA AYE OF LESS THAN TWO

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:47.616 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:50.186 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS A CERTIFIED.

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:52.655 region:rollup2
TO PRESCRIBE SO BOX ON WHICH

01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:54.824 region:rollup2
I THINK IS YOU KNOW.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:57.059 region:rollup2
AND BIG OPTION A BIG OPPORTUNITY

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:58.194 region:rollup2
FOR US.

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:59.528 region:rollup2
ONE OTHER THING CHF WILL BE

01:14:58.194 --> 01:15:01.530 region:rollup2
SHARING IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:03.432 region:rollup2
IS SNAPSHOTS BY COUNTY WHERE WE

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.966 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE THE PREVALENCE OF

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:05.368 region:rollup2
OPIOID USE DISORDER AND I

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:06.569 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:08.104 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT NUMBER OF EVEN OUR

01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:10.573 region:rollup2
FAME PRESCRIBERS AND METHADONE

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:11.974 region:rollup2
SLOTS AND THEN WHAT IT WILL TAKE

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:13.442 region:rollup2
TO MEET THE TREATMENT GAP AND SO

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.777 region:rollup2
I'M HOPING THAT WILL BE USEFUL

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:17.446 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR OWN.

01:15:14.777 --> 01:15:18.714 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO FIGURE OUT I'M

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:20.850 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW MUCH TREATMENT DO

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:21.484 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO BUILD BECAUSE IT'S

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.885 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT'S BEEN

01:15:21.484 --> 01:15:25.020 region:rollup2
ASKED.

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:27.123 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:29.291 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY WOMAN OR RENT.

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:29.825 region:rollup2
THANK YOU OF YOU KNOWS GREAT TO

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.427 region:rollup2
SEE I MEAN.

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:33.396 region:rollup2
VERY HEARTENING TO SEE THAT

01:15:31.427 --> 01:15:34.530 region:rollup2
CHART OF HOW MANY LESS

01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:35.631 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIONS ARE BEING WRITTEN

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.299 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY.

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:38.200 region:rollup2
CURIOUS HAS HELPED OUT A LOT IN

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:41.704 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.505 region:rollup2
OF OF PHYSICIANS HAS HAS HELPED

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:44.106 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:45.941 region:rollup2
SO I WAS WONDERING THAT THE

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:47.910 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OVERDOSES IS NOT.

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:50.446 region:rollup2
DECREASING.

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:53.783 region:rollup2
IT BUT IS THE NUMBER OF ARE THE

01:15:50.446 --> 01:15:55.618 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF ILLEGAL DRUG OVERDOSES

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:57.052 region:rollup2
INCREASING FASTER THAN THE

01:15:55.618 --> 01:16:00.289 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF.

01:15:57.052 --> 01:16:02.057 region:rollup2
LEGAL PRESCRIPTION SERVES THE

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:03.192 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE MOST

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:05.594 region:rollup2
RECENT DATA THOUGH IN THE NUMBER

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:07.830 region:rollup2
OF OVERDOSES IS IN FACTUALLY IN

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:08.464 region:rollup2
FACT IT'S IT'S DECREASING

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:10.499 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE DECREASE IS NOT YET

01:16:08.464 --> 01:16:11.934 region:rollup2
STOOD TO

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:13.069 region:rollup2
LIKELY SIGNIFICANT THAT'S WHY

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.602 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SEEING IT I'M FLAT ON THE

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:15.104 region:rollup2
GROUND SO IT IS SO. IT IS

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:17.306 region:rollup2
DECREASING.

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:19.308 region:rollup2
THERE PER BE NUMBER OF.

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:21.310 region:rollup2
OVERDOSES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:23.279 region:rollup2
HEROIN AND AND FENTON ALL ARE

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:25.014 region:rollup2
INCREASING

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:26.515 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL. UM'S

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:27.917 region:rollup2
STILL SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:29.385 region:rollup2
OVERDOSES INDESIT WE SEE ARE

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:31.420 region:rollup2
RELATED TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOID

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:33.222 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IS STILL

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:35.357 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE PREPONDERANCE OF OF

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:37.626 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. BUT WE DO

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:38.694 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT PROPORTION TO SHIFT

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:40.696 region:rollup2
AS WE.

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:41.764 region:rollup2
IN GAY IT AS WE ARE MORE AND

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:43.132 region:rollup2
MORE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:43.833 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING COMMUNITY AND

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:45.201 region:rollup2
LIMITING.

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:47.870 region:rollup2
ACTUAL PRESCRIPTIONS A NEW

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:50.072 region:rollup2
ADDICTIONS THAT ALSO LIMITS THE

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:52.007 region:rollup2
DRUG AVAILABILITY FOR DIVERSION

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:54.009 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WE HOPE THAT THAT

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:54.643 region:rollup2
WILL DECREASE THE OVERALL AMOUNT

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:56.378 region:rollup2
OF OF.

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:57.847 region:rollup2
OPIATES CIRCULATING IN A

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:59.381 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.616 region:rollup2
THE EAST COAST IN PARTICULAR IS

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:01.517 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.785 region:rollup2
HEROIN COMES UP REALLY QUICKLY

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:04.253 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:05.721 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE NEED THAT

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:07.556 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:09.258 region:rollup2
AS WELL AND BECAUSE THE

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:10.593 region:rollup2
INTERVENTIONS IN THAT WORLD AS

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:11.961 region:rollup2
FAR AS THAT. THE USER IS

01:17:10.593 --> 01:17:12.528 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THE INTERVENTIONS ARE

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:15.297 region:rollup2
VERY SIMILAR IF NOT THE SAME

01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:16.565 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.800 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF DECREASING THE

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.734 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF THAT THOSE DRUGS THAT

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.569 region:rollup2
ARE AVAILABLE TO VERY DIFFERENT

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:21.904 region:rollup2
WORLD.

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:24.039 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT IF AND IF YOU LOOK AT

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:25.174 region:rollup2
THAT CHART NO IT HAS BEEN VERY

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:26.909 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT IN THE LAST FIVE

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:28.077 region:rollup2
YEARS YEAH SO I WOULD I WOULD

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:29.478 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE WOULD ALL BE

01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:31.213 region:rollup2
PREDICTING A HUGE SPIKE IN AND

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:33.549 region:rollup2
HEROIN.

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:35.317 region:rollup2
YEAH AND SO IT SEEMS THAT THIS

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:37.920 region:rollup2
IS REALLY THE TIME TO THAT TO

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:39.088 region:rollup2
HAVE. A BIG FOCUS ON THESE

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.657 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE.

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:42.424 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.759 region:rollup2
YOU COULD GET A HOPEFULLY WE'RE

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:45.461 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO IS HAVE A CHART LIKE

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:48.063 region:rollup2
THE FRANCE CHART. IF YOU ARE

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:49.198 region:rollup2
ABLE TO OFFER OF AND YOU KNOW AS

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:50.733 region:rollup2
SOON AS THEY'RE OFF THE

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:52.968 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

01:17:50.733 --> 01:17:55.137 region:rollup2
THE THE SUBOXONE OR THAT.

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:56.005 region:rollup2
METHADONE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:57.606 region:rollup2
WE'RE HOPING FOR GOING TO

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:58.774 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE WE WE WANT TO AVOID THE

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:00.342 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN.

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:01.677 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:02.845 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THAT

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.546 region:rollup2
THIS WAS SHIFTING WE'VE KNOWN

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:05.080 region:rollup2
THAT FROM THE BEGINNING THAT

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:06.682 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A RISK AND THAT'S WHY

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.851 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAVE THIS MULTI SECTOR

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:11.086 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE TO TRY TO. PUT ALL

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:11.987 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS AND PLAY.

01:18:11.086 --> 01:18:13.455 region:rollup2
YEAH I JUST SPOKE WITH THE

01:18:11.987 --> 01:18:15.057 region:rollup2
MEDICAID DIRECTOR OF WEST

01:18:18.661 --> 01:18:20.329 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO THE EPIDEMIC IN

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:21.664 region:rollup2
THEIR.

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:23.232 region:rollup2
IN THEIR DEATH RATE CONTINUES

01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:25.167 region:rollup2
TO RISE IN THE WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:26.535 region:rollup2
IS THAT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:27.937 region:rollup2
HATES A BOX UNDER THE SEAT SOLD

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.837 region:rollup2
ON THE STREET AND WHAT THEY

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:29.972 region:rollup2
DON'T UNDERSTAND IS IT SOLD ON

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:31.907 region:rollup2
THE STREET BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET

01:18:29.972 --> 01:18:32.808 region:rollup2
IT. LEGAL IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:34.910 region:rollup2
GET TREATMENT AND THERE'S IS

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:36.011 region:rollup2
INVERSE RELATIONSHIP AS THE MORE

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:37.413 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE IT EASIER TO GET

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:38.981 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THE LESS YOU NEED

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:40.549 region:rollup2
ADVICE ABOUT SOME ON THE STREET.

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:42.718 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S A REAL CULTURE SHIFT IN

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:43.719 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EMBRACE

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:45.454 region:rollup2
TREATMENT AND AND I JUST WANNA

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:46.555 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S DIFFICULT

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:48.257 region:rollup2
AND AND.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:49.625 region:rollup2
AYE AYES YEAH THEY DON'T SEEM

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:50.859 region:rollup2
TO LIKE THIS METHADONE EITHER

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:51.393 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:55.030 region:rollup2
THESE TRIALS WITH ON THIS

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:56.432 region:rollup2
PATROL.

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:57.032 region:rollup2
THAT THERE AND VENTURA COUNTY

01:18:56.432 --> 01:18:58.534 region:rollup2
THEY'RE RUNNING A TRIAL RIGHT

01:18:57.032 --> 01:19:01.337 region:rollup2
NOW YEAH I THINK THERE'S A ROLE

01:18:58.534 --> 01:19:02.605 region:rollup2
FOR FOR ALL OF. THE TYPES OF OF

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:03.973 region:rollup2
ATTRITION AND PART OF THAT WE DO

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:04.940 region:rollup2
THINGS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE IN

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:06.909 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL COALITIONS.

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:08.310 region:rollup2
I WAS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BEFORE

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.645 region:rollup2
I CAME HERE AND WE HAD A

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:11.947 region:rollup2
COALITION IN AND.

01:19:09.645 --> 01:19:13.983 region:rollup2
NAPA WHERE I WORKED AND. I'M IT

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:15.284 region:rollup2
WASN'T VERY LONG AFTER ENGAGING

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:17.119 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY

01:19:15.284 --> 01:19:17.753 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:24.693 region:rollup2
DYNAMICS IN THAT STAND THE WHOLE

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:26.528 region:rollup2
PROBLEM

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:28.530 region:rollup2
MINISTRY FOR ALL OF US IF WE

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:30.232 region:rollup2
STAY IN OUR SILO AND THAT'S. ONE

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:33.102 region:rollup2
OF THE REASONS I I'M I'M PRETTY

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:34.169 region:rollup2
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUTCOMES AND IN

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:35.404 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A IS A

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:38.540 region:rollup2
PARTNER IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:39.842 region:rollup2
THESE LOCAL COALITION.

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.876 region:rollup2
AND IF I COULD DO ONE MORE STORY

01:19:39.842 --> 01:19:42.645 region:rollup2
WE WENT TO GO VISIT REIKERS

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:45.714 region:rollup2
ISLAND IN RHODE ISLAND BECAUSE

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:47.082 region:rollup2
THEY OFFER METHADONE PEOPLE

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:49.718 region:rollup2
OFTEN END OF A TRIAL IN THE

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:50.753 region:rollup2
JAILS. AND PRISONS THERE AND THE

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:52.454 region:rollup2
MAIN REASON THEY DID THAT IS

01:19:50.753 --> 01:19:53.822 region:rollup2
THEY FOUND A QUARTER OF THE

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:55.224 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO DIED IN RHODE ISLAND

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:56.392 region:rollup2

DREAD THEM OUT THEY USED

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:16.145 region:rollup2

RE ENTRY TO PREVENT THOSE THOSE

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:27.856 region:rollup2
DEATHS.

TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE THIS

01:21:09.465 --> 01:21:10.933 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND NOW THE

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:12.568 region:rollup2

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.904 region:rollup2
VENDORS AND SEE WHAT IT WOULD

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:17.072 region:rollup2
TAKE TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:18.540 region:rollup2
SO NOW INSTEAD OF A POLICY

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:19.575 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IT'S A. IT'S A TECHNICAL

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.676 region:rollup2

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.186 region:rollup2
DON'T NEED TO MANDATE

01:21:29.685 --> 01:21:32.488 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBERS TO CHECK IT IF IT'S

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:34.256 region:rollup2
FLOWS AND IT'S RIGHT THERE. IN

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:34.456 region:rollup2
YOUR FACE AND SO AGAIN I THINK

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:36.291 region:rollup2

WELL IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:52.141 region:rollup2
FOR SOMEONE IN THE THROES OF

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:53.709 region:rollup2
ADDICTION TO LISTEN TO WHITE

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN TELL THEM.

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:57.045 region:rollup2
THEY CAN FEEL BETTER IT'S VERY

01:21:55.611 --> 01:21:58.580 region:rollup2
IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPLAINS OF

01:21:57.045 --> 01:22:01.083 region:rollup2
SOMEONE'S WALK THAT TALK TO SAY

THIS TOO AND SO.

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:09.425 region:rollup2
RHODE ISLAND FOR EXAMPLE HAD A

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:11.026 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN WHERE THEY

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:12.461 region:rollup2
MADE SURE EVERY SINGLE EMERGENCY

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:14.563 region:rollup2
ROOM.

01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:15.631 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO GIVE SUBOXONE IN THE

01:22:14.563 --> 01:22:16.799 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOM SO YOU TAKE

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:18.901 region:rollup2

THEY'RE IN THE WORST WITHDRAW

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:21.970 region:rollup2
THEIR LIFE. AND WE GET MAD AT

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:23.439 region:rollup2
THEM WHEN THEY RUN OUT THE DOOR

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.072 region:rollup2
TO GET A FIX BECAUSE THEY FEEL

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.741 region:rollup2
LIKE THEY'RE GONNA DIE IF THEY

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:27.276 region:rollup2
GETS A BOX ON THEIR BRAIN STABLE

01:22:25.741 --> 01:22:28.076 region:rollup2
AND THEN. APPEAR PROVIDERS ON

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.978 region:rollup2
CALL IN THEY'VE CREATED A

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:31.780 region:rollup2
NETWORK OF THESE PEER PROVIDERS

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:32.648 region:rollup2
WHO HAD SOME EDUCATION SO THAT

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.783 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT.

01:22:32.648 --> 01:22:36.084 region:rollup2

BECOME CLEAN AND SOBER WITHOUT

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:40.189 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS AND THEN YOU CAN BE

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:41.990 region:rollup2
VERY JUDGMENTAL OF THOSE WHO

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:43.492 region:rollup2
NEED MEDICATIONS. AND SO THEY

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:45.060 region:rollup2
DIDN'T EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS OF

01:22:43.492 --> 01:22:46.762 region:rollup2

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND SO THEY

01:22:52.234 --> 01:22:55.671 region:rollup2
CREATED THIS THIRTY DAY

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:58.106 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION WHERE THE PEER

CURES.

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:26.068 region:rollup2
THE FLIP OF THAT WOULD INFER

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.803 region:rollup2
THAT OTHER MEDICAL ASSISTANT

01:23:26.068 --> 01:23:28.637 region:rollup2

ASSESSED THAT SPECIFICALLY IT

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:37.639 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE DATA SOURCES THAT

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:39.041 region:rollup2
ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:40.976 region:rollup2
IN COMBINATION WITH THE

THE CHRONIC.

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:55.924 region:rollup2

I'M I'M INTERESTED IN THE AGE

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:06.001 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT YOU HAVE FOUND HAS

01:25:03.899 --> 01:25:07.369 region:rollup2
BEEN THE MOST AT RISK IN TERMS

01:25:06.001 --> 01:25:09.605 region:rollup2
OF THIS EPIDEMIC THAT'S ONE

01:25:07.369 --> 01:25:11.273 region:rollup2
QUESTION. AND THEN TO.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.506 region:rollup2
I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE MY

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:13.809 region:rollup2

THIS FIELD WHO ARE EXPERTS CAN

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:18.981 region:rollup2
WE JUST STOP.

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:21.817 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING. THIS

01:25:18.981 --> 01:25:23.085 region:rollup2
DRUG.

01:25:21.817 --> 01:25:24.319 region:rollup2
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION IS OR

01:25:23.085 --> 01:25:26.088 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE IS THERE

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:28.924 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE OUT THERE.

01:25:26.088 --> 01:25:31.693 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HAVE THE.

01:25:28.924 --> 01:25:33.895 region:rollup2
LEASE KIND OF AFFECT.

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:35.430 region:rollup2
ON PEOPLE WITH THEY'LL CONTINUE

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:37.265 region:rollup2
TO FEED THIS ADDICTION.

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:38.233 region:rollup2
SO MANY DO THE LAST ONE FIRST IN

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:39.034 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ENOUGH

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:40.802 region:rollup2
OPIOIDS ARE PRESCRIBED IN

01:25:39.034 --> 01:25:42.537 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOR EVERY MAN WOMAN

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:44.406 region:rollup2
AND CHILD TO MEDICATE THEMSELVES

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:45.874 region:rollup2
AROUND THE CLOCK FOR A MONTH. SO

01:25:44.406 --> 01:25:47.275 region:rollup2
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'VE

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:48.977 region:rollup2
ALREADY GOT A GENERATION OF

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:50.879 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:52.280 region:rollup2
THESE MEDICATIONS AND THEIR

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:53.649 region:rollup2
BRAIN HAS BEEN SOMETIMES

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.283 region:rollup2
PERMANENTLY ALTERED BY

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:56.918 region:rollup2
DEPENDENCE ON THIS MEDICATION SO

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:58.053 region:rollup2
FLEET WHAT WE FOUND IN INDIANA

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:59.388 region:rollup2
AND OTHER STATES AS YOU.

01:25:58.053 --> 01:26:01.423 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY STOP PRESCRIBING THE

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:03.525 region:rollup2
DRUG YOU HAVE THE SAY EVEN IF

01:26:01.423 --> 01:26:04.760 region:rollup2
YOU CAN TAKE IT FOR PAIN NOT

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:06.361 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE ADDICTED YOUR

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.996 region:rollup2
TAKE IT LIKE A DOCTOR PRESCRIBED

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:10.666 region:rollup2
YOU GET THE SAME LEVEL OF.

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:12.668 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWAL AND CRAVING AND

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:14.970 region:rollup2
TECHNICALLY DOPE SICKNESS WHERE

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:17.606 region:rollup2
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:20.175 region:rollup2
YOU IN ORDER TO SURVIVE HE

01:26:17.606 --> 01:26:24.279 region:rollup2
TURNED TO STREET DRUGS THE

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:27.115 region:rollup2
TYPICAL PASSES HE START BUYING

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:29.851 region:rollup2
OXYCODONE THERE AND THEN YOU

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:31.486 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD IT ANYMORE AND

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:33.789 region:rollup2
HEROINES CHEAPER AND SO

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:38.760 region:rollup2
INDIANA'S ARE REALLY BIG SPIKE

01:26:33.789 --> 01:26:41.530 region:rollup2
IN HIV. BECAUSE OF MIDDLE CLASS.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.364 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WERE PROCLAIM

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:43.365 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WHO GOT CUT OFF

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:44.599 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY SO. I THINK IT'S VERY

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.767 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO STOP PRESCRIBING

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:47.369 region:rollup2
THE DRUG EXCESSIVELY TO STOP

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:49.071 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING AT HIGH DOSES TO

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:49.905 region:rollup2
STAB PRESCRIBING. FOR LONG

01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:51.540 region:rollup2
DURATIONS.

01:26:49.905 --> 01:26:52.340 region:rollup2
AND THAT TAKES A REAL CULTURE

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.442 region:rollup2
CHANGE FOR THE SAME TIME WE WANT

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.543 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE IT'S AVAILABLE FOR

01:26:53.442 --> 01:26:55.644 region:rollup2
TRAUMA AND CANCER AND END OF

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:56.645 region:rollup2
LIFE CARE. AND WE WANNA MAKE

01:26:55.644 --> 01:26:58.680 region:rollup2
SURE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:59.614 region:rollup2
HIGH DOSES ARE SLOWLY TAPERED TO

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.349 region:rollup2
A SAFER LOWER DOSES WITHOUT

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:01.950 region:rollup2
BEING CUT OFF BECAUSE THAT WILL

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:04.186 region:rollup2
ONLY INCREASE THE DEATH RATE.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:05.353 region:rollup2
.

01:27:04.186 --> 01:27:06.988 region:rollup2
I'D SAY THE FIRST QUESTION WAS

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:07.322 region:rollup2
ALL AGES WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:09.558 region:rollup2
THAT IT THE.

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:10.792 region:rollup2
IT'S A MUCH YOUNGER PROFILE

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:13.095 region:rollup2
THAN ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO.

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:14.129 region:rollup2
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DYING IN

01:27:13.095 --> 01:27:15.397 region:rollup2
THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF THEIR

01:27:14.129 --> 01:27:16.631 region:rollup2
DICTION SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:17.299 region:rollup2
DUST IN THEIR TWENTIES AND WE'RE

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.266 region:rollup2
ALSO SEEING.

01:27:17.299 --> 01:27:19.301 region:rollup2
EARLY MIDDLE AGE BECAUSE THOSE

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:20.902 region:rollup2
ARE THE FOLKS WHO.

01:27:19.301 --> 01:27:22.471 region:rollup2
HAVE CHRONIC PAIN A LOT OF THEM

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:23.872 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING CLASS DID MANUAL

01:27:22.471 --> 01:27:25.607 region:rollup2
LABOR THAT SPINE INJURIES WENT

01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:26.675 region:rollup2
TO THE DOCTOR. DIET PILLS AND

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:30.145 region:rollup2
THEN GOT DEPEND ON BECAME

01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:31.646 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT ON THOSE PILLS SO I AM

01:27:30.145 --> 01:27:33.048 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE'VE ULTIMATELY.

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:34.349 region:rollup2
SHIFTED THE LIFE EXPECTANCY IN

01:27:33.048 --> 01:27:36.485 region:rollup2
THE U. S. BECAUSE THESE THESE

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:38.220 region:rollup2
FOLKS ARE DYING AT YOUNGER AGES.

01:27:36.485 --> 01:27:39.454 region:rollup2

01:45:59.353 --> 01:46:03.090 region:rollup2
INVALUABLE IT IS TO THE PRACTICE

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:05.426 region:rollup2
OF PHARMACY AND HOW WE REQUIRE

01:46:03.090 --> 01:46:07.361 region:rollup2
PHARMACISTS TO REALLY RELY ON

01:46:05.426 --> 01:46:08.495 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION IN CARES TO MAKE

01:46:07.361 --> 01:46:09.563 region:rollup2
JUDGMENTS WHEN THEY HAVE A

01:46:08.495 --> 01:46:10.664 region:rollup2
PATIENT IN FRONT OF THEM.

01:46:09.563 --> 01:46:12.299 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY PATIENT THEY'RE NOT

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:13.868 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH. BEFORE I GET

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:15.302 region:rollup2
STARTED HOWEVER I NEED TO.

01:46:13.868 --> 01:46:17.204 region:rollup2
.

01:46:15.302 --> 01:46:18.973 region:rollup2
STATE THAT THE BOARD MANDATE

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:20.975 region:rollup2
THIS CONSUMER PROTECTION AND

01:46:18.973 --> 01:46:22.576 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY PROTECTION OF

01:46:20.975 --> 01:46:23.944 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND. WE START ALL

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:25.112 region:rollup2
PRESENTATIONS WITH THAT

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:26.847 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AFFIRMATION OF WHY

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:29.083 region:rollup2
WE'RE HERE.

01:46:26.847 --> 01:46:30.417 region:rollup2
I'M JUST REAL QUICKLY THE BOARD

01:46:29.083 --> 01:46:32.953 region:rollup2
LICENSES A HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:34.955 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DIFFERENT LICENSEES IN

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:37.224 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND WE

01:46:34.955 --> 01:46:38.792 region:rollup2
LICENSE INDIVIDUALS WITH LICENSE

01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:40.027 region:rollup2
FIRMS. AND WE LICENSE THE

01:46:38.792 --> 01:46:41.896 region:rollup2
PRODUCT ITSELF

01:46:40.027 --> 01:46:44.431 region:rollup2
SO WE PRETTY MUCH HAVE A FULLY

01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:45.1000 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED SHOP. ON WE GO INSIDE

01:46:44.431 --> 01:46:48.202 region:rollup2
AND OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA WITH

01:46:45.1000 --> 01:46:49.937 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO OUR ON INSPECTIONS

01:46:48.202 --> 01:46:51.705 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF SOME OF

01:46:49.937 --> 01:46:53.274 region:rollup2
THE ON PUBLIC PROTECTION ISSUES

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:55.109 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

01:46:53.274 --> 01:46:57.745 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:59.713 region:rollup2
PHARMACISTS ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND

01:46:57.745 --> 01:47:00.781 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES IN CALIFORNIA SIXTY

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:02.549 region:rollup2
SIX HUNDRED OF THEM ARE

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:04.518 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY PHARMACIES WHICH

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:06.086 region:rollup2
LOOKED COMMUNITY. PHARMACY ON

01:47:04.518 --> 01:47:07.621 region:rollup2
THE CORNER THAT YOU THINK ABOUT

01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:08.956 region:rollup2
WE ALSO REGULATE WHOLESALERS

01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:10.891 region:rollup2
WHICH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:47:08.956 --> 01:47:11.859 region:rollup2
TODAY BUT IT IS THE WHOLESALERS

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:13.294 region:rollup2
THAT SHIP THE DRUGS FROM THE

01:47:11.859 --> 01:47:14.928 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE.

01:47:13.294 --> 01:47:17.464 region:rollup2
TWO THE PHARMACIES AND THEY ARE

01:47:14.928 --> 01:47:19.733 region:rollup2
ALSO PART OF THIS MESS WITH US.

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:21.268 region:rollup2
.

01:47:19.733 --> 01:47:23.237 region:rollup2
DOCTOR STEPHEN HENRY IS IN THE

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:25.906 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE AND IN TWO THOUSAND

01:47:23.237 --> 01:47:28.575 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN HE CONDUCTED A SURVEY

01:47:25.906 --> 01:47:30.277 region:rollup2
OF PHARMACISTS AND CONCLUSIONS

01:47:28.575 --> 01:47:31.745 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR OPINIONS ON CURIOUS.

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:33.480 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M GONNA RUN RUN THROUGH

01:47:31.745 --> 01:47:35.115 region:rollup2
A SERIES OF FINDINGS FROM THAT

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:36.750 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST GOING TO BE REAL FAST.

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:39.219 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH

01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:40.220 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY JUST TELL ME TO STOP

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:41.322 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT I PROMISE THERE

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:43.490 region:rollup2
AREN'T THAT MANY OF THEM BUT

01:47:41.322 --> 01:47:45.959 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT.

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:48.395 region:rollup2
OKAY SO THE SURVEY.

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:50.030 region:rollup2
WAS COMPLETED HOME ABOUT A YEAR

01:47:48.395 --> 01:47:51.131 region:rollup2
AGO COMPLETED THE RESULTS IN

01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:52.499 region:rollup2
SEPTEMBER THEY WERE DOING IT

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:54.201 region:rollup2
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

01:47:52.499 --> 01:47:56.337 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:47:54.201 --> 01:47:59.106 region:rollup2
THAT TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF

01:47:56.337 --> 01:48:00.808 region:rollup2
THOSE REGISTERED IN ON CURES.

01:47:59.106 --> 01:48:02.509 region:rollup2
AND ARE PROVIDING INFORMATION

01:48:00.808 --> 01:48:04.211 region:rollup2
INTO THE CARE SYSTEM OUR

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:05.546 region:rollup2
PHARMACISTS BUT YET.

01:48:04.211 --> 01:48:07.114 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF THE REPORTS

01:48:05.546 --> 01:48:09.116 region:rollup2
PULLED OUT OF CURES ARE BEING

01:48:07.114 --> 01:48:10.951 region:rollup2
PULLED BY PHARMACISTS.

01:48:09.116 --> 01:48:13.887 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE MADE AT LEAST A

01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:15.055 region:rollup2
PIVOTAL IN A VERY IMPORTANT STEP

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:16.957 region:rollup2
IN CONVINCING OUR LICENSEES TO

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:18.792 region:rollup2
RELY ON THE SYSTEM. AS A

01:48:16.957 --> 01:48:19.293 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING STEP IN

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:20.227 region:rollup2
PROVIDING CARE TO THEIR

01:48:19.293 --> 01:48:22.296 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:23.897 region:rollup2
.

01:48:22.296 --> 01:48:25.299 region:rollup2
COP PHARMACISTS GENERALLY HAVE

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:27.067 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT

01:48:25.299 --> 01:48:28.736 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE AND

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:30.304 region:rollup2
MAKES BEST EXPRESSED JUST

01:48:28.736 --> 01:48:31.939 region:rollup2
GREATER SENSE OF PROFESSIONAL

01:48:30.304 --> 01:48:33.440 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION TO USE CURES AND

01:48:31.939 --> 01:48:34.975 region:rollup2
THAT'S BORNE OUT IN THE DATA I

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.344 region:rollup2
JUST PROVIDED WITH YOU.

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:38.679 region:rollup2
PHARMACIST LISTED INFORMATION

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:41.081 region:rollup2
FROM TEARS AS THE MOST COMMON

01:48:38.679 --> 01:48:42.750 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR CHANGES IN THEIR

01:48:41.081 --> 01:48:44.885 region:rollup2
DISPENSING PATTERNS.

01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:46.987 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN AND THE SHORT FEW YEARS

01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:49.790 region:rollup2
THAT PHARMACIES HAVE REALLY BEEN

01:48:46.987 --> 01:48:51.325 region:rollup2
ACCESSING CURES WE'VE SEEN I'M I

01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:52.760 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED DIFFERENCE THERE.

01:48:51.325 --> 01:48:54.862 region:rollup2
NEARLY ALL PHARMACISTS REPORTED

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:56.663 region:rollup2
THEY'D HEARD OF CURES WHICH IS

01:48:54.862 --> 01:48:58.465 region:rollup2
GOOD SO THERE'S ANY THERE'S.

01:48:56.663 --> 01:48:59.800 region:rollup2
IDENTIFICATION

01:48:58.465 --> 01:49:01.101 region:rollup2
BESIDES THAT THEY ALL HAVE TO BE

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:03.737 region:rollup2
REGISTERED IF THEY HAVE AN

01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:04.605 region:rollup2
ACTIVE LICENSE EVEN IF THEY'RE

01:49:03.737 --> 01:49:06.073 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA THE REQUIRED.

01:49:04.605 --> 01:49:08.509 region:rollup2
REGISTERED.

01:49:06.073 --> 01:49:10.010 region:rollup2
AMONG RESPONDENTS WHO WERE

01:49:08.509 --> 01:49:11.111 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO REGISTER PICTURES

01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:12.546 region:rollup2
NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THE

01:49:11.111 --> 01:49:14.214 region:rollup2
PHARMACIST REPORTED THEY WERE

01:49:12.546 --> 01:49:15.816 region:rollup2
REGISTERED ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:17.718 region:rollup2
REGISTERING FOR CHARIS. KEEP IN

01:49:15.816 --> 01:49:19.119 region:rollup2
MIND THIS SURVEY WENT BACK TO

01:49:17.718 --> 01:49:21.288 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSANDS.

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:22.489 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:23.090 region:rollup2
SIX MONTHS RIGHT AFTER THAT DROP

01:49:22.489 --> 01:49:25.859 region:rollup2
DEAD DEADLINE.

01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:26.493 region:rollup2
SO.

01:49:25.859 --> 01:49:27.428 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD HAVE ALL BEEN THERE

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:29.096 region:rollup2
SO. PERHAPS WE HAVE MORE

01:49:27.428 --> 01:49:30.197 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:49:29.096 --> 01:49:31.498 region:rollup2
WHEN ASKED WHETHER THEY FELT

01:49:30.197 --> 01:49:33.901 region:rollup2
THEY NEEDED ADDITIONAL TRAINING

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:35.869 region:rollup2
EDUCAR IN EDUCATION ABOUT CURES

01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:36.537 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT OF THE RISK

01:49:35.869 --> 01:49:38.472 region:rollup2
PHARMACIST RESPONDED

01:49:36.537 --> 01:49:39.873 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATIVELY.

01:49:38.472 --> 01:49:41.875 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE NOT USING IT FOR MORE

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:44.311 region:rollup2
THAN JUST CLEAN A SINGLE PATIENT

01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:45.546 region:rollup2
REPORT ONE AT A TIME SOMETIMES.

01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:46.680 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE SUBSCRIBER

01:49:45.546 --> 01:49:48.882 region:rollup2
ALERTS AND SOME OF THE

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:51.185 region:rollup2
NOTIFICATIONS ARE INTEGRAL PARTS

01:49:48.882 --> 01:49:54.188 region:rollup2
OF THE NEW SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

01:49:51.185 --> 01:49:55.889 region:rollup2
NOT HELPED OUR PROFESSION.

01:49:54.188 --> 01:49:56.457 region:rollup2
ON ACCESSING UP AND SO WITH THAT

01:49:55.889 --> 01:49:57.891 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THE

01:49:56.457 --> 01:49:59.426 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO HELP

01:49:57.891 --> 01:50:01.595 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THAT.

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:03.897 region:rollup2
A SENSE FINANCIAL MAJORITY OF

01:50:01.595 --> 01:50:04.932 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS AND

01:50:03.897 --> 01:50:06.934 region:rollup2
PHARMACIST HAD THIS AT NINETY

01:50:04.932 --> 01:50:08.168 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT AGREED THAT THEIR

01:50:06.934 --> 01:50:10.471 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES SHOULD BE USING CARES

01:50:08.168 --> 01:50:12.406 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY DISPENSE.

01:50:10.471 --> 01:50:14.074 region:rollup2
SO MAYBETHEY DON'T DO IT

01:50:12.406 --> 01:50:14.641 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES BUT THEY THINK

01:50:14.074 --> 01:50:15.776 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COLLEAGUES SHOULD BE

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:17.344 region:rollup2
DOING THAT.

01:50:15.776 --> 01:50:18.545 region:rollup2
AND THEN THIRTY NINE PERCENT A

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:22.149 region:rollup2
PHARMACIST SUPPORTED MANDATORY

01:50:18.545 --> 01:50:23.417 region:rollup2
CURES FOR THEIR COLLEAGUES.

01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:24.618 region:rollup2
SO THE END RESULT IN THERE SOME

01:50:23.417 --> 01:50:25.886 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ONES BUT IN THE

01:50:24.618 --> 01:50:27.387 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF TIME TO GET THE

01:50:25.886 --> 01:50:29.289 region:rollup2
OTHER PANELISTS OPPORTUNITY TO

01:50:27.387 --> 01:50:30.724 region:rollup2
SPEAK. THE SURVEY RESULTS

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:32.559 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT ACCESS TO CURES HAS

01:50:30.724 --> 01:50:35.128 region:rollup2
A MAJOR IMPACT ON PHARMACISTS

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:36.597 region:rollup2
DISPENSING. PRACTICES THAT

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:38.065 region:rollup2
INCREASE PROFESSIONAL AWARENESS

01:50:36.597 --> 01:50:39.132 region:rollup2
OF RISK AND BENEFITS PLAYS A

01:50:38.065 --> 01:50:40.834 region:rollup2
MAJOR ROLE IN DECREASED

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:43.003 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING AND DISPENSING FOR

01:50:40.834 --> 01:50:44.671 region:rollup2
BOTH PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS

01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:46.373 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY THE SURVEY RESULTS

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:47.774 region:rollup2
INDICATE THE PHARMACIST. HAVE

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:49.209 region:rollup2
PRETTY NEAR COME PERFECT

01:50:47.774 --> 01:50:51.812 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH MANDATORY CURES

01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:54.648 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION.

01:50:51.812 --> 01:50:55.883 region:rollup2
SO. I AM NOW GOING TO GO BACK TO

01:50:54.648 --> 01:50:59.086 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS WE'VE

01:50:55.883 --> 01:51:00.254 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING.

01:50:59.086 --> 01:51:02.055 region:rollup2
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE VALUE

01:51:00.254 --> 01:51:03.423 region:rollup2
OF CURES FIRST

01:51:02.055 --> 01:51:04.958 region:rollup2
YOU HEARD ON THIS FOR ALICE

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:06.627 region:rollup2
SPEAK ABOUT SIX.

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:09.997 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBERS.

01:51:06.627 --> 01:51:12.332 region:rollup2
SIX PHARMACIES IN SIX MONTHS.

01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:12.933 region:rollup2
LET'S LET ME TALK ABOUT. SOME OF

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:14.501 region:rollup2
THE STARK HORROR STORIES THAT

01:51:12.933 --> 01:51:15.602 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT.

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:17.838 region:rollup2
IN A FOUR YEAR PERIOD THAT

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:18.338 region:rollup2
PERIOD WE HAVE ONE PATIENT IN

01:51:17.838 --> 01:51:20.841 region:rollup2
THIS IS FROM THE BOREDOM

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:22.075 region:rollup2
DESICCATION. WE FOUND FOR

01:51:20.841 --> 01:51:24.778 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PATIENTS WITH

01:51:22.075 --> 01:51:25.712 region:rollup2
OBSCENELY HIGH DRUG USAGE.

01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:27.314 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT A DOCTOR SHOPPER

01:51:25.712 --> 01:51:29.149 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE

01:51:27.314 --> 01:51:31.084 region:rollup2
IN A FOUR YEAR PERIOD PERIOD A

01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:33.086 region:rollup2
PATIENT OBTAIN SIX HUNDRED AND

01:51:31.084 --> 01:51:34.488 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX PRESCRIPTIONS FOR

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:35.756 region:rollup2
VARIOUS CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES

01:51:34.488 --> 01:51:36.523 region:rollup2
THERE WERE OVER TWENTY FIVE

01:51:35.756 --> 01:51:38.325 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:39.960 region:rollup2

JUST READ OFF OF THE FORTY FOUR

01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:13.820 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THE STREET VALUE OF

QUITE A BIT OF MONEY IN A VERY

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:22.863 region:rollup2
NARROW TIMEFRAME.

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:24.998 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE

01:53:22.863 --> 01:53:27.134 region:rollup2
VERY.

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:27.768 region:rollup2
THERE IS ONE OTHER ARM START

01:53:27.134 --> 01:53:29.169 region:rollup2
THERE IS ONE OTHER ONE LET ME

01:53:27.768 --> 01:53:30.170 region:rollup2

THOSE WERE NOT SELF USE THAT WAS

01:53:47.087 --> 01:53:52.426 region:rollup2
STRUCK CELLS.

01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:53.794 region:rollup2
SO CURIOUS IF PHARMACISTS WOULD

01:53:52.426 --> 01:53:55.295 region:rollup2
GET IN THE HABIT OF LOOKING AT

01:53:53.794 --> 01:53:57.264 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:53:55.295 --> 01:53:58.999 region:rollup2
THEY CAN IDENTIFY WHAT'S GOING

01:53:57.264 --> 01:54:00.333 region:rollup2
ON S. COULD THE PRESCRIBERS AT

01:53:58.999 --> 01:54:01.568 region:rollup2
THE TIME THE PRESCRIBING WHICH

01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:02.936 region:rollup2
IS PART OF WHAT THE ROLE THAT

01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:04.805 region:rollup2
WERE ALL UP HERE.

01:54:02.936 --> 01:54:05.405 region:rollup2
AND THIS.

01:54:04.805 --> 01:54:06.940 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:08.842 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT.

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:10.877 region:rollup2
THE BOARD IS SPENDING A LOT OF

01:54:08.842 --> 01:54:13.747 region:rollup2
TIME DOING SOME PROACTIVE THINGS

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:15.582 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROFESSION. ON WE ARE

01:54:13.747 --> 01:54:17.517 region:rollup2
THE ORIGIN OF SEVERAL

01:54:15.582 --> 01:54:18.952 region:rollup2
MODIFICATIONS PROPOSED FOR CURES

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:20.153 region:rollup2

01:54:18.952 --> 01:54:21.655 region:rollup2
AUTHOR OF THE. THANK YOU VERY

EVERY TWO TO THREE MONTHS C. E.

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:32.365 region:rollup2
SEMINARS WHERE THE BOARD OF

01:54:29.363 --> 01:54:34.334 region:rollup2
PHARMACY LITERALLY TALKS TO OUR.

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:35.736 region:rollup2
LICENSEES THEY GIVE SOME SIX

01:54:34.334 --> 01:54:37.938 region:rollup2
HOURS OF SLEEP ANY PRETENDING

01:54:35.736 --> 01:54:39.106 region:rollup2
SIX HOUR SESSIONS WHERE WE TALK

01:54:37.938 --> 01:54:40.640 region:rollup2
ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OF

01:54:39.106 --> 01:54:42.342 region:rollup2
ABUSE BECAUSE SOMETIMES

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:43.543 region:rollup2
PHARMACISTS DON'T KNOW THAT

01:54:42.342 --> 01:54:45.145 region:rollup2
THOSE DRUGS THAT ARE BACK ON

01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:46.847 region:rollup2
THEIR SHELVES. HAVE SUCH HIGH

01:54:45.145 --> 01:54:48.682 region:rollup2
STREET VALUE AND IN THAT ALL

01:54:46.847 --> 01:54:50.650 region:rollup2
JUST GIVE THE OLD STORY ABOUT

01:54:48.682 --> 01:54:51.785 region:rollup2
PROMETHAZINE WITH CODEINE. COST

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:53.120 region:rollup2
THE PHARMACY APPROXIMATELY

01:54:51.785 --> 01:54:55.856 region:rollup2
TWELVE DOLLARS TO PURCHASE A

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.456 region:rollup2
PLATE OF IT. ON THE STREET THAT

01:54:55.856 --> 01:54:58.792 region:rollup2
DRUG IS WORTH TWELVE HUNDRED

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:59.693 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THERE'S A HUGE SPREAD

01:54:58.792 --> 01:55:02.028 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE ROBBERIES YOU'RE

01:54:59.693 --> 01:55:04.131 region:rollup2
SEEN IN SACRAMENTO IF YOU'RE

01:55:02.028 --> 01:55:05.098 region:rollup2
WATCHING TV. BUT THEY'RE JUMPING

01:55:04.131 --> 01:55:06.299 region:rollup2
COUNTERS.

01:55:05.098 --> 01:55:07.701 region:rollup2
PRINCIPAL TARGET OF THOSE

01:55:06.299 --> 01:55:09.002 region:rollup2
JUMPING THE COUNTERS IS PRO MET

01:55:07.701 --> 01:55:10.771 region:rollup2
WITH CODY WHICH IS CURRENTLY

01:55:09.002 --> 01:55:13.106 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED PIPE DRUG.

01:55:10.771 --> 01:55:15.675 region:rollup2
AND NOT REPORTED IN. INTEGERS.

01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:17.544 region:rollup2
ON.

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:20.313 region:rollup2
WE ARE. ALSO.

01:55:17.544 --> 01:55:22.182 region:rollup2
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE USE OF

01:55:20.313 --> 01:55:24.217 region:rollup2
CURES AND WE PROMOTE IT. WE HAVE

01:55:22.182 --> 01:55:25.118 region:rollup2
THE D. E. YEAR D. E. ACRE MEN

01:55:24.217 --> 01:55:26.853 region:rollup2
AND THEY TALK ABOUT HOW TO

01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:28.922 region:rollup2
SURVIVE THE D. E. A. INSPECTION

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:30.056 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE D. E. A. DOES GO IN

01:55:28.922 --> 01:55:32.459 region:rollup2
AND INSPECT AS DOES THE BOARD OF

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:33.493 region:rollup2
PHARMACY. WE HAVE OUR OWN BOTTOM

01:55:32.459 --> 01:55:35.228 region:rollup2
PHARMACISTS THAT OUR

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:36.396 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS AND WE HAVE FIFTY

01:55:35.228 --> 01:55:38.165 region:rollup2
OF THEM.

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:40.100 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE BUSY WITH THOSE FIFTY

01:55:38.165 --> 01:55:41.668 region:rollup2
ONE THIRD OF THEM TARGET

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:43.570 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY PRESCRIPTION DRUG

01:55:41.668 --> 01:55:44.771 region:rollup2
ABUSE AND FRAUD.

01:55:43.570 --> 01:55:47.274 region:rollup2
DRUG DIVERSION FROM PHARMACIES

01:55:44.771 --> 01:55:49.910 region:rollup2
AND WHOLESALERS.

01:55:47.274 --> 01:55:52.279 region:rollup2
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF.

01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:53.146 region:rollup2
.

01:55:52.279 --> 01:55:54.781 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT CORRESPONDING

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:56.082 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY AND IN THE

01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:57.818 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF TIME I DON'T WANT TO

01:55:56.082 --> 01:55:59.553 region:rollup2
GO ON ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S A

01:55:57.818 --> 01:56:00.987 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SUBJECT TO A DEGREE.

01:55:59.553 --> 01:56:02.889 region:rollup2
BUT BASICALLY CORRESPONDING

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:04.691 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY IS A LOT BUT THE

01:56:02.889 --> 01:56:06.526 region:rollup2
FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL WERE A

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:09.095 region:rollup2
PHARMACIST HAS THE OBLIGATION

01:56:06.526 --> 01:56:11.465 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL ON RESPONSIBILITY.

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:13.266 region:rollup2
AND LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO ASSURE

01:56:11.465 --> 01:56:14.301 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN HE OR SHE IS FILLING A

01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:15.602 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION THAT THE

01:56:14.301 --> 01:56:17.437 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION IS RIGHT FOR THAT

01:56:15.602 --> 01:56:19.606 region:rollup2
PATIENT. AND EVEN IF THE

01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:22.075 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBER IDENTIFIES THAT YES I

01:56:19.606 --> 01:56:23.777 region:rollup2
WROTE THE PRESCRIPTION WE EXPECT

01:56:22.075 --> 01:56:25.078 region:rollup2
THE PHARMACIST TO SAY NO IF IT'S

01:56:23.777 --> 01:56:26.880 region:rollup2
IN HIS OR HER PROFESSIONAL

01:56:25.078 --> 01:56:28.448 region:rollup2
JUDGMENT THAT PATIENT SHOULDN'T

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.284 region:rollup2
HAVE. AND THERE'S A SERIES OF

01:56:28.448 --> 01:56:33.119 region:rollup2
RED FLAGS THAT DID NOTE WHEN.

01:56:31.284 --> 01:56:34.287 region:rollup2
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD NOT BE

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:36.356 region:rollup2
DISPENSED IN A DRUG TO APPEASE.

01:56:34.287 --> 01:56:38.492 region:rollup2
.

01:56:36.356 --> 01:56:41.027 region:rollup2
WE ARE WORKING WITH PHARMACIES

01:56:38.492 --> 01:56:41.761 region:rollup2
ON MEDICATION RECONCILIATION AND

01:56:41.027 --> 01:56:43.830 region:rollup2
COUNTING THEIR SCHEDULE TWO

01:56:41.761 --> 01:56:46.199 region:rollup2
DRUGS BECAUSE PHARMACIES ARE A

01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:48.134 region:rollup2
MAJOR SOURCE OF LEACHING OUT

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:49.769 region:rollup2
INTO THE STREET. EMPLOYEES AND

01:56:48.134 --> 01:56:51.805 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES ARE THOSE THAT HAVE

01:56:49.769 --> 01:56:53.540 region:rollup2
ACCESS THE DRUGS ARE SO VALUABLE

01:56:51.805 --> 01:56:55.275 region:rollup2
THEY CORRUPT AND THEY END UP

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:57.177 region:rollup2
COMING OUT OF THE PHARMACIES AND

01:56:55.275 --> 01:56:59.112 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE NOW AT THE STAGE WHERE

01:56:57.177 --> 01:57:00.614 region:rollup2
STARTING APRIL ONE. AND IT'S NOT

01:56:59.112 --> 01:57:01.848 region:rollup2
A JOKE WE ARE REQUIRING

01:57:00.614 --> 01:57:03.183 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES

01:57:01.848 --> 01:57:04.184 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT SCHEDULE TWO DRUGS IN

01:57:03.183 --> 01:57:05.785 region:rollup2
THEIR POSSESSION. EVERY NINETY

01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:07.287 region:rollup2
DAYS

01:57:05.785 --> 01:57:08.521 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE TO RECONCILE WHAT

01:57:07.287 --> 01:57:10.524 region:rollup2
THEY PURCHASE WITH WHAT THEY

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:12.425 region:rollup2
DISPENSED TO FIND OUT IF THERE

01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:13.426 region:rollup2
WERE LOSSES OR OVER JUST IN

01:57:12.425 --> 01:57:16.696 region:rollup2
WHICH CASE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

01:57:13.426 --> 01:57:19.633 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN.

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:21.468 region:rollup2
SO. ON. THAT PRETTY MUCH

01:57:19.633 --> 01:57:23.236 region:rollup2
CONCLUDES THE BULK OF WHAT I

01:58:23.897 --> 01:58:26.399 region:rollup2
TO OUR CONCERNS AND HAS MADE

01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:28.101 region:rollup2
CHANGES BASED UPON BOARD STAFF'S

01:58:26.399 --> 01:58:30.303 region:rollup2

THE NEW SYSTEM.

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.809 region:rollup2
THE BOARD IS VERY PLEASED WITH

01:58:35.008 --> 01:58:37.344 region:rollup2
THE NEW CARES TO POINT OUT

01:58:35.809 --> 01:58:38.912 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AS NOT ONLY DOES IT

PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENT AND

01:58:38.912 --> 01:58:42.482 region:rollup2
TIMELY ACCESS BUT IT ALSO

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:44.417 region:rollup2
PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION TO THE

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:46.286 region:rollup2
BOARD. FOR EXAMPLE WERE GETTING

01:58:44.417 --> 01:58:48.154 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION NUMBERS REFILLS

01:58:46.286 --> 01:58:48.755 region:rollup2

AND THE ABILITY NOW TO CUSTOMIZE

01:58:55.295 --> 01:58:58.632 region:rollup2
REPORTS.

01:58:57.330 --> 01:59:00.066 region:rollup2
THE MEDICAL BOARD CANNOT

01:58:58.632 --> 01:59:01.134 region:rollup2
UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:02.736 region:rollup2
CARE SYSTEM AND IT'S AN

01:59:01.134 --> 01:59:04.604 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS AND ITS

01:59:02.736 --> 01:59:06.306 region:rollup2
MISSION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION.

01:59:04.604 --> 01:59:08.341 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO

01:59:06.306 --> 01:59:09.876 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

01:59:08.341 --> 01:59:11.277 region:rollup2
HOWEVER BEFORE AGAIN TO BEGIN

01:59:09.876 --> 01:59:12.679 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ACTUALLY

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:14.781 region:rollup2
USED THE CARE SYSTEM AND THE

01:59:12.679 --> 01:59:16.349 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS FROM KIDS

01:59:14.781 --> 01:59:17.584 region:rollup2
TO PLAY NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO BE

01:59:16.349 --> 01:59:18.852 region:rollup2
CLEAR THAT THE CARES IS JUST A

01:59:17.584 --> 01:59:19.986 region:rollup2
TOOL USE IN THE INVESTIGATION

01:59:18.852 --> 01:59:21.154 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:22.956 region:rollup2
THE BOARD COULD NEVER TAKE

01:59:21.154 --> 01:59:24.624 region:rollup2
ACTION AGAINST THE POSITION JUST

01:59:22.956 --> 01:59:25.892 region:rollup2
BASED UPON THE CARES REPORT.

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:27.794 region:rollup2
MANY MORE PROCEDURES ACTUALLY

01:59:25.892 --> 01:59:29.195 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE COMPLETED SO THE

01:59:27.794 --> 01:59:30.664 region:rollup2
BOARD MUST VALIDATE THE

01:59:29.195 --> 01:59:32.332 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND CARES AND MORE

01:59:30.664 --> 01:59:34.100 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY WE MUST ATTAIN A

01:59:32.332 --> 01:59:35.602 region:rollup2
PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:37.637 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION IN THESE TYPES OF

01:59:35.602 --> 01:59:38.972 region:rollup2
CASES THE BOARD MUST HAVE A

01:59:37.637 --> 01:59:39.939 region:rollup2
MEDICAL EXPERTS SAY THAT THERE

01:59:38.972 --> 01:59:41.241 region:rollup2
WAS A DEPARTURE FROM THE

01:59:39.939 --> 01:59:42.575 region:rollup2
STANDARD OF CARE. IN THE

01:59:41.241 --> 01:59:44.577 region:rollup2
TREATMENT PROVIDED TO THE

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:45.779 region:rollup2
PATIENT BY THE PHYSICIAN.

01:59:44.577 --> 01:59:47.514 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN THE USEFULNESS OF

01:59:45.779 --> 01:59:49.382 region:rollup2
CURES IN THIS PROCESS AGAIN

01:59:47.514 --> 01:59:50.183 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE UNDERSCORED. ABOUT

01:59:49.382 --> 01:59:51.851 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OF THE

01:59:50.183 --> 01:59:52.819 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:54.754 region:rollup2
AT THE HEALTH QUALITY

01:59:52.819 --> 01:59:56.056 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION UNIT ARE RELATED

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:57.724 region:rollup2
TO INAPPROPRIATE UNDER OVER

01:59:56.056 --> 01:59:59.426 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING OF CONTROLLED

01:59:57.724 --> 02:00:01.227 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCES BY A PHYSICIAN.

01:59:59.426 --> 02:00:02.862 region:rollup2
THE BOARD USES THE CARE SYSTEM

02:00:01.227 --> 02:00:04.431 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO MEET ITS MISSION OF

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:05.832 region:rollup2
CONSUMER PROTECTION AND TO TAKE

02:00:04.431 --> 02:00:07.600 region:rollup2
ACTION AGAINST THE POSITIONS WHO

02:00:05.832 --> 02:00:09.235 region:rollup2
ARE A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC.

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.904 region:rollup2
WITHOUT KID HERE'S THE BOARD

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:12.338 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THIS

02:00:10.904 --> 02:00:13.673 region:rollup2
MISSION AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

02:00:12.338 --> 02:00:14.874 region:rollup2
STOP INAPPROPRIATE AND OVER

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:17.277 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING INTO VERSION OF

02:00:14.874 --> 02:00:17.844 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.

02:00:17.277 --> 02:00:19.612 region:rollup2
THE BOARD USES CARES IN ITS

02:00:17.844 --> 02:00:21.181 region:rollup2
ROLE.

02:00:19.612 --> 02:00:22.916 region:rollup2
BASICALLY IN ITS ENFORCEMENT

02:00:21.181 --> 02:00:24.217 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IF THE BOARD RECEIVES A

02:00:22.916 --> 02:00:26.052 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT REGARDING ANY

02:00:24.217 --> 02:00:27.954 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING ISSUES RELATED TO

02:00:26.052 --> 02:00:29.923 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES IT IS ABLE

02:00:27.954 --> 02:00:31.791 region:rollup2
TO NOT ONLY OBTAIN FROM A CURES

02:00:29.923 --> 02:00:32.826 region:rollup2
RECORD OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:34.160 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT INVOLVED IN THE

02:00:32.826 --> 02:00:35.161 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT. BUT ALSO FOR THE

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:36.596 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN LISTED AS THE

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:38.298 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBER.

02:00:36.596 --> 02:00:39.299 region:rollup2
THIS IS USUALLY THE FIRST STEP

02:00:38.298 --> 02:00:41.101 region:rollup2
IN THE INITIAL REVIEW OF THESE

02:00:39.299 --> 02:00:42.001 region:rollup2
TYPES OF COMPLAINTS.

02:00:41.101 --> 02:00:44.003 region:rollup2
THE BOARD WILL RUN A PATIENT

02:00:42.001 --> 02:00:45.438 region:rollup2
PROFILE REPORT AND A PRESCRIBER

02:00:44.003 --> 02:00:47.207 region:rollup2
HISTORY REPORT TO OBTAIN THE

02:00:45.438 --> 02:00:48.842 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION INFORMATION.

02:00:47.207 --> 02:00:50.243 region:rollup2
DEPENDING UPON THE COMPLAIN THE

02:00:48.842 --> 02:00:52.612 region:rollup2
CURES REPORT MAY NEED TO BE

02:00:50.243 --> 02:00:54.114 region:rollup2
EVALUATED BY A MEDICAL EXPERT.

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:55.515 region:rollup2
IN THE SAME SPECIALITY ASK THE

02:00:54.114 --> 02:00:57.450 region:rollup2
POSITION TO IDENTIFY THE

02:00:55.515 --> 02:00:59.819 region:rollup2
PATIENTS NEED TO BE REVIEWED TO

02:00:57.450 --> 02:01:01.387 region:rollup2
DETERMINE IF THE PHYSICIAN IS

02:00:59.819 --> 02:01:03.056 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATELY PRESCRIBING. IN

02:01:01.387 --> 02:01:05.325 region:rollup2
ADDITION THAT EXPERT COME LOOK

02:01:03.056 --> 02:01:06.793 region:rollup2
AT THE COMBINATION OF DRUGS USE

02:01:05.325 --> 02:01:08.461 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS ANY OTHER RED FLAGS

02:01:06.793 --> 02:01:10.063 region:rollup2
THAT SUGGEST THE POSITION MAY BE

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:11.297 region:rollup2
A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC.

02:01:10.063 --> 02:01:12.966 region:rollup2
AND ITS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT A

02:01:11.297 --> 02:01:14.834 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THAT WHEN WE GET TO

02:01:12.966 --> 02:01:16.369 region:rollup2
THAT POINT WE ACTUALLY THERE'S

02:01:14.834 --> 02:01:17.604 region:rollup2
ONLY THREE WAYS IN CALIFORNIA

02:01:16.369 --> 02:01:19.038 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN OBTAIN THOSE

02:01:17.604 --> 02:01:20.373 region:rollup2
PATIENTS MEDICAL RECORDS.

02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:22.075 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST WAY IS THAT WE

02:01:20.373 --> 02:01:23.810 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE TO OBTAIN A SIGNED

02:01:22.075 --> 02:01:25.411 region:rollup2
PATIENT AUTHORIZATION TO GET

02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:27.213 region:rollup2
THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:27.981 region:rollup2
OR IF THE PATIENT IS DECEASED WE

02:01:27.213 --> 02:01:29.582 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ATTEMPT TO GET

02:01:27.981 --> 02:01:31.251 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZATION FROM THE PATIENT'S

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:32.952 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARY OR PERSON. PERSONAL

02:01:31.251 --> 02:01:34.354 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE.

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:35.755 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A

02:01:34.354 --> 02:01:37.290 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE OVER PRESCRIBING

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:39.325 region:rollup2
CASES THE BOARD CANNOT GET THE

02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:40.693 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZATION FROM THE PATIENT.

02:01:39.325 --> 02:01:43.263 region:rollup2
SO THEREFORE THE BOARD MUST GO

02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:45.131 region:rollup2
TO ITS SECOND OPTION AND MUST BE

02:01:43.263 --> 02:01:46.800 region:rollup2
ABLE TO OBTAIN AT A SUBPOENA FOR

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:48.535 region:rollup2
THIS MATTER BUT WE DO HAVE TO

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.869 region:rollup2
HAVE A PATIENTS NAMES AND THE

02:01:48.535 --> 02:01:51.337 region:rollup2
ONLY WAY WE CAN OBTAIN THAT IS

02:01:49.869 --> 02:01:52.839 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CARE SYSTEM.

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:54.374 region:rollup2
AND THEN IN ADDITION WE ALSO

02:01:52.839 --> 02:01:56.209 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE GOOD CAUSE TO

02:01:54.374 --> 02:01:57.577 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATE THAT SUBPOENA.

02:01:56.209 --> 02:01:58.778 region:rollup2
I'M IF THE MATTER WAS ACTUALLY A

02:01:57.577 --> 02:02:00.280 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL MATTER THIS IS THE

02:01:58.778 --> 02:02:01.381 region:rollup2
THIRD WAY WE WOULD ACTUALLY THEN

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:02.815 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A SEARCH

02:02:01.381 --> 02:02:04.484 region:rollup2
WARRANT BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO

02:02:02.815 --> 02:02:06.519 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO SUPPORT

02:02:04.484 --> 02:02:08.321 region:rollup2
THAT. TO GO TO THE COURTS

02:02:06.519 --> 02:02:09.422 region:rollup2
SO AS YOU CAN SEE IN OUR PROCESS

02:02:08.321 --> 02:02:11.391 region:rollup2
OF TAKING ACTION AGAINST A

02:02:09.422 --> 02:02:13.593 region:rollup2
POSITION AT THAT THE IMPORTANCE

02:02:11.391 --> 02:02:15.328 region:rollup2
OF CURES IS WHAT HELPS US TO DO

02:02:13.593 --> 02:02:16.863 region:rollup2
OUR ROLE. IN MEETING THE MANDATE

02:02:15.328 --> 02:02:18.531 region:rollup2
OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THEN

02:02:16.863 --> 02:02:20.667 region:rollup2
ALSO BEING ABLE TO DISCIPLINE

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:22.268 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS WHO ARE IN DANGER I'M

02:02:20.667 --> 02:02:23.770 region:rollup2
FOR THE PUBLIC AND SO WITH THAT

02:02:22.268 --> 02:02:24.904 region:rollup2
I'LL CLOSE AND.

02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:25.572 region:rollup2
THAT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:28.474 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR

02:02:25.572 --> 02:02:30.944 region:rollup2
HAVING ME HERE.

02:02:28.474 --> 02:02:32.245 region:rollup2
CRITIC YOU VERY MUCH INDEED GOOD

02:02:30.944 --> 02:02:34.480 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ON DR GRANT.

02:02:32.245 --> 02:02:36.015 region:rollup2
SO FIRST I JUST WANT TO AGAIN

AND REALLY HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:51.631 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS AND. WE NEED TO BE

TO PROVIDERS WANTING TO HELP.

02:02:55.568 --> 02:02:59.239 region:rollup2
SO I WANTED TO ACTUALLY TURN IF

02:02:57.637 --> 02:03:00.373 region:rollup2
I COULD ASK THE PHARMACIST I

02:02:59.239 --> 02:03:00.940 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE HAD.

02:03:00.373 --> 02:03:02.475 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTED TO.

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:04.611 region:rollup2
.

02:03:02.475 --> 02:03:07.013 region:rollup2
ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO BE ABLE TO

02:03:04.611 --> 02:03:09.015 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBE NOR CAN TO PATIENTS IN

02:03:07.013 --> 02:03:10.350 region:rollup2
THOSE SITUATIONS THAT YOU WERE

02:03:09.015 --> 02:03:12.218 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING EARLIER OF OF THE OUT

02:03:10.350 --> 02:03:14.087 region:rollup2
LIARS.

02:03:12.218 --> 02:03:15.521 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE ANY DATA TO FOLLOW UP

02:03:14.087 --> 02:03:17.590 region:rollup2
AND FIGURE OUT IF WE'VE BEEN

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:19.125 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING NOR CAN.

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:20.960 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE RATES THAT

02:03:19.125 --> 02:03:22.528 region:rollup2
PHARMACISTS ARE USING?

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.963 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THAT LIFESAVING

02:03:22.528 --> 02:03:25.265 region:rollup2
MEDICATION OUT AND IS THERE

02:03:23.963 --> 02:03:27.734 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THAT FOR.

02:03:25.265 --> 02:03:30.436 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:03:27.734 --> 02:03:32.205 region:rollup2
YES AND NO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:34.107 region:rollup2
OUR C. E. SEMINARS IF THEY STAY

02:03:32.205 --> 02:03:35.708 region:rollup2
AN EXTRA HOUR WE ARE EDUCATING

02:03:34.107 --> 02:03:37.277 region:rollup2
PHARMACISTS THAT STAYED THE

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:38.544 region:rollup2
EXTRA HOUR TO EARN THAT OUR THAT

02:03:37.277 --> 02:03:39.879 region:rollup2
THEY NEED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:41.914 region:rollup2
THAT UNDER THEIR OWN AUTHORITY.

02:03:39.879 --> 02:03:43.549 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS IS IT'S A DRUG THAT

02:03:41.914 --> 02:03:44.984 region:rollup2
BLOCKS OVERDOSE AND ALTHOUGH

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:47.654 region:rollup2
IT'S A PRESCRIPTION ITEM THAT

02:03:44.984 --> 02:03:47.654 region:rollup2
ALLOWS A PHARMACIST TO PROVIDE

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:52.258 region:rollup2
HAND? SO AT THE TIME FOR EXAMPLE

02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:52.458 region:rollup2
WE SEE A USE AT THE TIME YOU GET

02:03:52.258 --> 02:03:54.961 region:rollup2
AND.

02:03:52.458 --> 02:03:55.762 region:rollup2
OPIOID FROM THE PHARMACY THEY

02:03:54.961 --> 02:03:57.497 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING THE

02:03:55.762 --> 02:03:59.832 region:rollup2
CONSULTING SPECIFICALLY IN THE

02:03:57.497 --> 02:04:00.867 region:rollup2
AREA. THERE IS A STRUGGLE AT IN

02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:02.502 region:rollup2
THE EVENT YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENTAL

02:04:00.867 --> 02:04:04.404 region:rollup2
OVERDOSE THIS IS WHAT YOU TAKE

02:04:02.502 --> 02:04:05.738 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT THERE YET BOMB I THINK

02:04:04.404 --> 02:04:06.873 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S GOING BE BUILT MORE

02:04:05.738 --> 02:04:09.108 region:rollup2
LESS TO THAT EFFECT INTRODUCED

02:04:06.873 --> 02:04:11.811 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR. WE HAVE TRAINED

02:04:09.108 --> 02:04:13.313 region:rollup2
OURSELVES ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

02:04:11.811 --> 02:04:15.248 region:rollup2
PHARMACISTS SPECIFICALLY TO

02:04:13.313 --> 02:04:16.916 region:rollup2
PROVIDE NALOXONE BECAUSE WE

02:04:15.248 --> 02:04:18.751 region:rollup2
STRONGLY BELIEVE IT'S AN

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:20.119 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD. WE ARE

02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:21.220 region:rollup2
ABOUT TODAY WE HAVE A BOARD

02:04:20.119 --> 02:04:23.289 region:rollup2
MEETING WHERE ONE OF THE

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:25.825 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES IS GOING TO BE PUT ON A

02:04:23.289 --> 02:04:27.460 region:rollup2
WHEN OUR C. E. PROGRAM. ONLINE

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:30.096 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE GO

02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:30.763 region:rollup2
ONLINE AND CERTIFY AND DO IT

02:04:30.096 --> 02:04:32.031 region:rollup2
THAT WAY.

02:04:30.763 --> 02:04:34.167 region:rollup2
BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM AS WITH

02:04:32.031 --> 02:04:36.336 region:rollup2
ANY DRUG AND EVEN THE ABUSE ONCE

02:04:34.167 --> 02:04:37.971 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S THE REIMBURSEMENT PEACE

02:04:36.336 --> 02:04:39.305 region:rollup2
AND SO THE PHARMACY WOULD HAVE

02:04:37.971 --> 02:04:40.773 region:rollup2
TO ASK THE PATIENT EITHER

02:04:39.305 --> 02:04:43.009 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES INSURANCE WILL COVER

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:44.210 region:rollup2
IT. SOMETIMES IT WON'T.

02:04:43.009 --> 02:04:46.045 region:rollup2
AND IF IT DOESN'T THEN THEY'LL

02:04:44.210 --> 02:04:47.847 region:rollup2
HAVE TO CHARGE THE PATIENT FOR

02:04:46.045 --> 02:04:49.882 region:rollup2
THE DRUG AND THAT BECOMES A

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:51.184 region:rollup2
DETERRENT AND UNFORTUNATELY LIKE

02:04:49.882 --> 02:04:52.985 region:rollup2
MANY THINGS SOME OF THE DRUGS

02:04:51.184 --> 02:04:54.887 region:rollup2
HAVE GOTTEN VERY EXPENSIVE. THE

02:04:52.985 --> 02:04:56.389 region:rollup2
MOST WONDERFUL DEVICE OUT THERE

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:58.825 region:rollup2
IS THE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

02:04:56.389 --> 02:05:00.326 region:rollup2
FOR TWO ADMINISTRATIONS.

02:04:58.825 --> 02:05:01.861 region:rollup2
SELF ADMINISTRATOR EIGHT

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:03.930 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING UNIT THAT WALKS

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:04.530 region:rollup2
YOU THROUGH STICKING YOURSELF

02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:06.232 region:rollup2
WITH THE PRODUCTS THOUGH THAT

02:05:04.530 --> 02:05:08.001 region:rollup2
IN.

02:05:06.232 --> 02:05:09.435 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE'S OVERDOSING AT LEAST

02:05:08.001 --> 02:05:10.903 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE GOING TO BE

02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:13.306 region:rollup2
VERY INTIMIDATED VERY FRIGHTENED

02:05:10.903 --> 02:05:14.240 region:rollup2
THIS LITERALLY WALKS YOU THROUGH

02:05:13.306 --> 02:05:15.775 region:rollup2
VERY CALMLY WE THREE COULD DO.

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:18.244 region:rollup2
BUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:05:15.775 --> 02:05:20.113 region:rollup2
FOR TWO DOSES THAT IS ALL AROUND

02:05:18.244 --> 02:05:21.114 region:rollup2
FOR MANY AND I BELIEVE THAT IS

02:05:20.113 --> 02:05:22.648 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE WHOLESALE PRICE.

02:05:21.114 --> 02:05:23.950 region:rollup2
SO TO ANSWER YOU WE'VE GOT A

02:05:22.648 --> 02:05:25.017 region:rollup2
LONG WAY TO GO IN THIS BUT WE

02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:27.053 region:rollup2
SEE REAL PROMISE SOME REAL

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:29.722 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL AND IT IS IN FACT A

02:05:27.053 --> 02:05:32.358 region:rollup2

RIGHT PLACE TO DO IT.

DEFINITIVELY THAT.

02:28:30.802 --> 02:28:33.671 region:rollup2
THERE IS STRONG REASON TO THINK

02:28:53.024 --> 02:28:58.129 region:rollup2
A SIMPLE MATTER OF. THE FACT

STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THE

02:30:56.915 --> 02:31:00.385 region:rollup2
INTERSTATE STRATEGY IS AN

02:30:58.716 --> 02:31:02.420 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT ONE.

02:31:00.385 --> 02:31:04.355 region:rollup2
INCLUDING SCHEDULE FIVE IS

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:07.158 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

TRULY ACCIDENTAL.

02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:19.137 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS IF THEY

02:31:17.402 --> 02:31:19.771 region:rollup2
DON'T LOOK.

02:31:19.137 --> 02:31:21.339 region:rollup2
DON'T REALIZE THAT THE

02:31:19.771 --> 02:31:23.308 region:rollup2
INTERACTION.

02:31:21.339 --> 02:31:25.209 region:rollup2
BETWEEN SOME OF THOSE DRUGS AND.

02:31:23.308 --> 02:31:26.778 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OPIOIDS CAN BE

02:31:25.209 --> 02:31:28.146 region:rollup2
FATAL.

02:31:26.778 --> 02:31:29.647 region:rollup2
OF SO THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

SUPPORTING THEM.

02:31:38.756 --> 02:31:42.393 region:rollup2

US.

02:32:13.624 --> 02:32:17.462 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

02:32:15.426 --> 02:32:19.697 region:rollup2
THAT LAW WAS SIGNED BY THE

02:32:17.462 --> 02:32:25.203 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR.

02:32:19.697 --> 02:32:28.172 region:rollup2
IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN.

WE ARE NOW AND FEBRUARY OF

02:32:28.172 --> 02:32:31.876 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

02:32:30.375 --> 02:32:35.513 region:rollup2
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

02:32:31.876 --> 02:32:37.849 region:rollup2
HAS NOT YET CERTIFIED.

02:32:35.513 --> 02:32:39.851 region:rollup2
CURES TWO POINT ZERO.

02:32:37.849 --> 02:32:41.352 region:rollup2
TO US.

02:32:39.851 --> 02:32:42.153 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE NOT PROFESSIONALS IN

02:32:41.352 --> 02:32:43.821 region:rollup2
THAT ORGANIZATION BUT FOR US

02:32:42.153 --> 02:32:45.456 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:32:43.821 --> 02:32:47.759 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:49.727 region:rollup2
FACING. THAT DELAYS IN

02:32:47.759 --> 02:32:50.128 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY INEXPLICABLE

02:32:49.727 --> 02:32:52.397 region:rollup2
AND.

02:32:50.128 --> 02:32:53.798 region:rollup2
WE WOULD HOPE AND HEARING TODAY

02:32:52.397 --> 02:32:56.534 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE WE WOULD GET SOME

02:32:53.798 --> 02:32:58.236 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION IN JULY.

02:32:56.534 --> 02:33:00.104 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE WOULD HOPE THAT THAT

02:32:58.236 --> 02:33:02.840 region:rollup2
PROCESS WOULD BE ACCELERATED.

02:33:00.104 --> 02:33:05.209 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT FOR

02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:07.211 region:rollup2
EIGHTY TWO TO ITS FULLEST.

02:33:05.209 --> 02:33:08.146 region:rollup2
IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION THEM

02:33:07.211 --> 02:33:10.014 region:rollup2
WE'VE EXPERIENCED.

02:33:08.146 --> 02:33:11.315 region:rollup2
SO FAR.

02:33:10.014 --> 02:33:13.785 region:rollup2
I'M NOT GOING TO RELITIGATE THE

02:33:11.315 --> 02:33:15.586 region:rollup2
LUIS CASE WE THINK IT'S GOOD LAW

02:33:13.785 --> 02:33:16.320 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE BALANCE STRUCK

02:33:15.586 --> 02:33:18.289 region:rollup2
IAN.

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:19.390 region:rollup2
LOUIS.

02:33:18.289 --> 02:33:21.225 region:rollup2
REALLY REFLECTS.

02:33:19.390 --> 02:33:23.528 region:rollup2
.

02:33:21.225 --> 02:33:24.796 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT WE'RE

02:33:23.528 --> 02:33:27.598 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE THE

02:33:24.796 --> 02:33:29.801 region:rollup2
LEWIS CASE DID TALK ABOUT.

02:33:27.598 --> 02:33:32.804 region:rollup2
THEORETICAL PRIVACY RIGHTS THAT

02:33:29.801 --> 02:33:34.172 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE. INTRUDED UPON.

02:33:32.804 --> 02:33:36.140 region:rollup2
BUT IT MADE KNOWN THE IT MADE

02:33:34.172 --> 02:33:37.975 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC NOTE OF THE STATE'S

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:39.444 region:rollup2
DUAL INTEREST.

02:33:37.975 --> 02:33:42.146 region:rollup2
IN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM

02:33:39.444 --> 02:33:44.115 region:rollup2
THE UNLAWFUL USE AND DIVERSION.

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:45.883 region:rollup2
A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS CLASS

02:33:44.115 --> 02:33:47.819 region:rollup2
OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:49.420 region:rollup2
PROTECTING PATIENTS FROM

02:33:47.819 --> 02:33:50.688 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENT OR INCOMPETENT

02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:52.490 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS THAT'S A VERY

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:55.126 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BALANCING TEST.

02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:57.528 region:rollup2
THE CITATION OF THE UTAH.

02:33:55.126 --> 02:33:59.897 region:rollup2
SITUATION IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT

02:33:57.528 --> 02:34:01.933 region:rollup2
TO THIS DISCUSSION FIRST OF ALL

02:33:59.897 --> 02:34:03.801 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU

02:34:01.933 --> 02:34:05.403 region:rollup2
AGES TOLD. THE ATTORNEY

02:34:03.801 --> 02:34:06.671 region:rollup2
GENERAL'S OFFICE

02:34:05.403 --> 02:34:08.973 region:rollup2
DOES NOT PERMIT UNFETTERED

02:34:06.671 --> 02:34:10.641 region:rollup2
ACCESS

02:34:08.973 --> 02:34:11.709 region:rollup2
A PATIENT RECORDS IN FACT.

02:34:10.641 --> 02:34:13.411 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY GENERAL HARRIS.

02:34:11.709 --> 02:34:15.146 region:rollup2
.

02:34:13.411 --> 02:34:16.914 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THE GUIDELINES THAT

02:34:15.146 --> 02:34:20.785 region:rollup2
SHE PROMULGATED.

02:34:16.914 --> 02:34:23.221 region:rollup2
A LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN ONLY GET

02:34:20.785 --> 02:34:25.056 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO PATIENT RECORDS IN A

02:34:23.221 --> 02:34:26.190 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

02:34:25.056 --> 02:34:28.092 region:rollup2
OF THE PATIENT WHERE THEY HAVE A

02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:29.227 region:rollup2
WARRANT.

02:34:28.092 --> 02:34:30.728 region:rollup2
SO.

02:34:29.227 --> 02:34:32.497 region:rollup2
AYE AYE I WOULD CAUTION YOU

02:34:30.728 --> 02:34:34.365 region:rollup2
AGAINST.

02:34:32.497 --> 02:34:36.200 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IRRELEVANT EXAMPLES

02:34:34.365 --> 02:34:38.002 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER STATES I MEAN THE

02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:39.537 region:rollup2
PRIVACY ISSUE SERIOUS BUT IT

02:34:38.002 --> 02:34:40.371 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT SERIOUSLY

02:34:39.537 --> 02:34:42.406 region:rollup2
AND SOBERLY.

02:34:40.371 --> 02:34:44.108 region:rollup2
.

02:34:42.406 --> 02:34:44.976 region:rollup2
FINALLY JUST A COUPLE OF NOTES

02:34:44.108 --> 02:34:47.445 region:rollup2
TO CALL TO YOUR ATTENTION.

02:34:44.976 --> 02:34:48.012 region:rollup2
.

02:34:47.445 --> 02:34:50.047 region:rollup2
THERE BEEN SOME UNINTENDED

02:34:48.012 --> 02:34:52.083 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE

02:34:50.047 --> 02:34:55.353 region:rollup2
OF PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN.

02:34:52.083 --> 02:34:58.022 region:rollup2
WHICH AS YOU KNOW OF REDUCES THE

02:34:55.353 --> 02:35:00.158 region:rollup2
PENALTY FOR CERTAIN RETAIL THEFT

02:34:58.022 --> 02:35:01.759 region:rollup2
SO LONG AS YOU STEAL LESS THAN

02:35:00.158 --> 02:35:02.460 region:rollup2
NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS

02:35:01.759 --> 02:35:04.061 region:rollup2
MAKES IT A FELONY I MAKES A

02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:05.263 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR.

02:35:04.061 --> 02:35:06.798 region:rollup2
WHAT ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF

02:35:05.263 --> 02:35:08.1000 region:rollup2
THAT THAT HAS

02:35:06.798 --> 02:35:11.469 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN DISCUSSED IS THERE'S A

02:35:08.1000 --> 02:35:13.805 region:rollup2
NICHE OF THAT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY?

02:35:11.469 --> 02:35:16.073 region:rollup2
WHERE PERSONS ARE STEALING

02:35:13.805 --> 02:35:18.442 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS?

02:35:16.073 --> 02:35:20.278 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE A RETAIL VALUE.

02:35:18.442 --> 02:35:22.013 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES

02:35:20.278 --> 02:35:23.314 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A RETAIL VALUE UNDER

02:35:22.013 --> 02:35:24.715 region:rollup2
NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS

02:35:23.314 --> 02:35:27.451 region:rollup2
BUT IS ONE OF THE WITNESSES ON A

02:35:24.715 --> 02:35:28.786 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS PANEL. INDICATED HAVE A

02:35:27.451 --> 02:35:30.555 region:rollup2
STREET VALUE IN THE HUNDREDS OF

02:35:28.786 --> 02:35:32.056 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

02:35:30.555 --> 02:35:33.491 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE

02:35:32.056 --> 02:35:35.059 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:35:33.491 --> 02:35:37.161 region:rollup2
THE PROP FORTY SEVEN RETAIL

02:35:35.059 --> 02:35:39.597 region:rollup2
THEFT

02:35:37.161 --> 02:35:41.966 region:rollup2
GAP THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

02:35:39.597 --> 02:35:44.268 region:rollup2
BUT MISSING FROM THAT DISCUSSION

02:35:41.966 --> 02:35:45.736 region:rollup2
THUS FAR BY THIS LEGISLATURE.

02:35:44.268 --> 02:35:47.271 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON THIS MORE

02:35:45.736 --> 02:35:50.708 region:rollup2
NARROW NICHE

02:35:47.271 --> 02:35:51.709 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE CAN STEAL OPIOIDS.

02:35:50.708 --> 02:35:52.276 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS THEY'RE UNDER NINE

02:35:51.709 --> 02:35:54.011 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY BUCKS HEY

02:35:52.276 --> 02:35:55.446 region:rollup2
IT'S.

02:35:54.011 --> 02:35:56.981 region:rollup2
IT'S A MISDEMEANOR.

02:35:55.446 --> 02:35:58.916 region:rollup2
IN THEN THAT'S OUT IN THE

02:35:56.981 --> 02:35:59.951 region:rollup2
STREETS SO I THINK THAT'S A

02:35:58.916 --> 02:36:00.918 region:rollup2
PIECE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT.

02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:02.954 region:rollup2
.

02:36:00.918 --> 02:36:04.455 region:rollup2
DESPITE.

02:36:02.954 --> 02:36:05.990 region:rollup2
ARE VERY HIGH RESPECT FOR DR

02:36:04.455 --> 02:36:08.526 region:rollup2
EGGMAN.

02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:09.660 region:rollup2
WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB ONE AB

02:36:08.526 --> 02:36:11.495 region:rollup2
SIX

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:13.264 region:rollup2
FOR SEVERAL REASONS

02:36:11.495 --> 02:36:15.299 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL AB ONE EIGHTY SIX

02:36:13.264 --> 02:36:17.068 region:rollup2
HAS NO PATH TO TREATMENT.

02:36:15.299 --> 02:36:18.402 region:rollup2
IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN

02:36:17.068 --> 02:36:20.338 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDICTIVE

02:36:18.402 --> 02:36:22.073 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR AND TREATMENT.

02:36:20.338 --> 02:36:23.841 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE A PATH TO TREATMENT

02:36:22.073 --> 02:36:25.476 region:rollup2
AND NOT TO ENABLE CONTINUED

02:36:23.841 --> 02:36:29.113 region:rollup2
ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR.

02:36:25.476 --> 02:36:33.150 region:rollup2
SECONDLY AB ONE EIGHTY SIX HAS.

02:36:29.113 --> 02:36:34.719 region:rollup2
NO REAL STRATEGIC USE OF

02:36:33.150 --> 02:36:35.853 region:rollup2
METHADONE THERAPIES WHICH ARE

02:36:34.719 --> 02:36:39.123 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:36:35.853 --> 02:36:40.758 region:rollup2
SUBSTITUTE FOR OPIOIDS.

02:36:39.123 --> 02:36:44.061 region:rollup2
THIRDLY.

02:36:40.758 --> 02:36:46.530 region:rollup2
AND VERY DISTURBING IS THERE'S

02:36:44.061 --> 02:36:48.499 region:rollup2
NO STRATEGY IN AB ONE AB SIX TO

02:36:46.530 --> 02:36:49.767 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH IMPAIR DRIVING. NOT

02:36:48.499 --> 02:36:50.601 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WHO GOES TO SAFE

02:36:49.767 --> 02:36:52.637 region:rollup2
INJECTION SITE.

02:36:50.601 --> 02:36:54.005 region:rollup2
IS WALKING.

02:36:52.637 --> 02:36:55.506 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN FACT A LARGE

02:36:54.005 --> 02:36:58.776 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:36:55.506 --> 02:37:00.311 region:rollup2
OPIOID ADDICTED AB JOBS.

02:36:58.776 --> 02:37:01.846 region:rollup2
IF CARS THERE'S NO.

BUT I WOULD REMIND EVERYBODY

02:46:55.973 --> 02:46:59.142 region:rollup2
THAT THE INCIDENCE OF ADDICTION

02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:00.377 region:rollup2
IS ARGUABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND

02:46:59.142 --> 02:47:02.045 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE

02:47:00.377 --> 02:47:03.080 region:rollup2

PRESCRIBE A YOU'VE HEARD

02:47:31.975 --> 02:47:35.746 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY ABOUT RED FLAGS AND

02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:37.581 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS COMBINATIONS.

02:47:35.746 --> 02:47:39.216 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES COMPLEX MEDICAL

COMPLEX SOLUTIONS

02:47:41.585 --> 02:47:44.254 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

WORLD.

02:47:44.254 --> 02:47:47.224 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME PATIENTS

02:47:45.923 --> 02:47:48.058 region:rollup2
WITH CHRONIC PAIN MANY OF WHOM

02:47:47.224 --> 02:47:49.893 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD THE PRACTICE FOR

02:47:48.058 --> 02:47:51.762 region:rollup2
DECADES ARE FINDING IT

02:47:49.893 --> 02:47:53.430 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN

02:47:51.762 --> 02:47:55.832 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE

02:47:53.430 --> 02:47:57.267 region:rollup2
CURRENT THINKING ABOUT MAXIMUM

02:47:55.832 --> 02:47:58.835 region:rollup2
DOSAGE LIMITATIONS AND THAT SORT

02:47:57.267 --> 02:48:00.103 region:rollup2
OF THING.

02:47:58.835 --> 02:48:02.105 region:rollup2
WHICH IN A GENERAL WAY WAS GOOD

02:48:00.103 --> 02:48:03.140 region:rollup2
BUT IN A SPECIFIC WAY MAY NOT BE

02:48:02.105 --> 02:48:05.475 region:rollup2
FOR CERTAIN PATIENT POPULATIONS.

02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:08.145 region:rollup2
.

02:48:05.475 --> 02:48:09.146 region:rollup2
SO. OUR CURRENT CONCERNS ABOUT

02:48:08.145 --> 02:48:10.714 region:rollup2
JURORS IS THAT.

02:48:09.146 --> 02:48:12.416 region:rollup2

WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED THE BETA

02:48:17.487 --> 02:48:21.491 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVING. ITS.

02:48:20.157 --> 02:48:23.727 region:rollup2
.

02:48:21.491 --> 02:48:24.928 region:rollup2
A UTILITY.

02:48:23.727 --> 02:48:26.263 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF THINGS OF CONCERN A

02:48:24.928 --> 02:48:27.564 region:rollup2
WAGON DATA REPORTING IS A

02:48:26.263 --> 02:48:29.433 region:rollup2
CURRENT SEVEN DAY REQUIREMENT

02:48:27.564 --> 02:48:30.734 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCES.

02:48:29.433 --> 02:48:32.002 region:rollup2
IT LEAVES A GAP IN WHICH A TRUE

02:48:30.734 --> 02:48:33.670 region:rollup2
DOCTOR SHOPPER COULD OBTAIN

02:48:32.002 --> 02:48:35.038 region:rollup2
INFILL MULTIPLE PRESCRIPTIONS

02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:35.539 region:rollup2
PER PER DATA WHICH OPEN AND

02:48:35.038 --> 02:48:37.207 region:rollup2
CURES.

02:48:35.539 --> 02:48:39.309 region:rollup2
DATABASE SIMILAR TO PRESCRIBE

02:48:37.207 --> 02:48:40.243 region:rollup2
OR THE PHARMACIST.

02:48:39.309 --> 02:48:41.645 region:rollup2
AND SHE MAYES ADVOCATED

02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:42.779 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO

02:48:41.645 --> 02:48:44.614 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE REPORTING TIMELINE

02:48:42.779 --> 02:48:46.183 region:rollup2
FOR PHARMACISTS WHICH COULD MAKE

02:48:44.614 --> 02:48:47.718 region:rollup2
A LARGE IMPACT ON THE SYSTEM'S

02:48:46.183 --> 02:48:49.119 region:rollup2
USEFULNESS.

02:48:47.718 --> 02:48:50.721 region:rollup2
AND SADLY.

02:48:49.119 --> 02:48:52.055 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL VERY FREQUENT

02:48:50.721 --> 02:48:53.357 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH THE SYSTEM KICKING

02:48:52.055 --> 02:48:54.992 region:rollup2
USERS OFF.

02:48:53.357 --> 02:48:56.426 region:rollup2
AS YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL PATIENT

02:48:54.992 --> 02:48:58.261 region:rollup2
REPORTS OR NOT I MEAN ALLOWING

02:48:56.426 --> 02:48:59.429 region:rollup2
THEM TO LOG IN.

02:48:58.261 --> 02:49:01.898 region:rollup2
NO NO I WORK WITH.

02:48:59.429 --> 02:49:03.233 region:rollup2
THE DOJ AND EARLY VERSIONS SAYS

02:49:01.898 --> 02:49:04.801 region:rollup2
DURING PORTENT CLINICAL PRACTICE

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:06.236 region:rollup2
LIKE MINOR OR IN PRACTICE FOR

02:49:04.801 --> 02:49:08.105 region:rollup2
THAT MATTER. IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:49:06.236 --> 02:49:09.906 region:rollup2
FULLY IMPLEMENT CURES DATABASE

02:49:08.105 --> 02:49:11.241 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO BUILD ACCESS

02:49:09.906 --> 02:49:13.010 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE OFFICE.

02:49:11.241 --> 02:49:15.412 region:rollup2
IN MY PRACTICE WE.

02:49:13.010 --> 02:49:17.214 region:rollup2
DO A HUNDRED PERCENT CURES.

02:49:15.412 --> 02:49:18.548 region:rollup2
REVIEW WE ACTUALLY.

02:49:17.214 --> 02:49:19.916 region:rollup2
A DOWNLOAD THE.

02:49:18.548 --> 02:49:21.752 region:rollup2
CURES REPORT.

02:49:19.916 --> 02:49:23.120 region:rollup2
AND APPENDEDTO THE OFFICE

02:49:21.752 --> 02:49:24.454 region:rollup2
REPORTS ON ALL MY PATIENTS

02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:25.722 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATIC PAIN PRACTITIONERS SO

02:49:24.454 --> 02:49:27.224 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART

02:49:25.722 --> 02:49:29.259 region:rollup2
OF MY MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT

02:49:27.224 --> 02:49:31.128 region:rollup2
PATIENTS. PATIENTS AWARE OF ALL

02:49:29.259 --> 02:49:33.163 region:rollup2
OF THIS STUFF AS WAS DONE

02:49:31.128 --> 02:49:34.331 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED TO. OF

02:49:33.163 --> 02:49:36.833 region:rollup2
PATIENT AGREEMENT OR CONTROLLED

02:49:34.331 --> 02:49:37.367 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT IS ALSO COMPONENT OF

02:49:36.833 --> 02:49:38.635 region:rollup2
A PRACTICE.

02:49:37.367 --> 02:49:39.836 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU'RE PRESCRIBING

02:49:38.635 --> 02:49:41.171 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE?

02:49:39.836 --> 02:49:43.306 region:rollup2
CHAU AS PART OF THE PARTNERSHIP

02:49:41.171 --> 02:49:44.941 region:rollup2
OF PROVIDING SAFE.

02:49:43.306 --> 02:49:46.043 region:rollup2
MEDICAL PRACTICE THAT THE

02:49:44.941 --> 02:49:47.444 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ARE AWARE THAT THIS

02:49:46.043 --> 02:49:49.012 region:rollup2
DOES IS GOING ON.

02:49:47.444 --> 02:49:50.547 region:rollup2
.

02:49:49.012 --> 02:49:51.048 region:rollup2
SO WE SHOULD CONTINUE HAVE

02:49:50.547 --> 02:49:52.015 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:49:51.048 --> 02:49:53.684 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS.

02:49:52.015 --> 02:49:54.618 region:rollup2
.

02:49:53.684 --> 02:49:55.185 region:rollup2
A PERHAPS THERE COULD BE SOME

02:49:54.618 --> 02:49:56.453 region:rollup2
SHOPPING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

02:49:55.185 --> 02:49:58.021 region:rollup2
DOJ.

02:49:56.453 --> 02:50:00.223 region:rollup2
.

02:49:58.021 --> 02:50:02.125 region:rollup2
AND OUR CONCERN ABOUT MANDATING

02:50:00.223 --> 02:50:03.693 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM THAT MAY NOT BE READY

02:50:02.125 --> 02:50:04.961 region:rollup2
FOR PRIMETIME IS THAT IT IT IT

02:50:03.693 --> 02:50:06.430 region:rollup2
IT UNFAIRLY IMPACTS A

02:50:04.961 --> 02:50:08.498 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONER.

02:50:06.430 --> 02:50:09.466 region:rollup2
IN AND TRYING TO PROVIDE A A

02:50:08.498 --> 02:50:11.201 region:rollup2
MANDATED.

02:50:09.466 --> 02:50:13.136 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION THAT WERE UNABLE

02:50:11.201 --> 02:50:14.471 region:rollup2
TO TO PROVIDE.

02:50:13.136 --> 02:50:16.139 region:rollup2
ALSO IMPORTANTLY THE CURE

02:50:14.471 --> 02:50:17.507 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT FROM ANY

02:50:16.139 --> 02:50:18.842 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES IN CRITICAL WAYS IT

02:50:17.507 --> 02:50:20.243 region:rollup2
IN HIS HOUSE INTO LAW

02:50:18.842 --> 02:50:20.777 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT ENTITY.

02:50:20.243 --> 02:50:22.412 region:rollup2
AND.

02:50:20.777 --> 02:50:24.848 region:rollup2
FOR THE PAINT COMMUNITY OF

02:50:22.412 --> 02:50:27.350 region:rollup2
MINING OF CURSE DATA AND AND.

02:50:24.848 --> 02:50:27.851 region:rollup2
FINDING AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN

02:50:27.350 --> 02:50:29.720 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBE MEDICINES AND

02:50:27.851 --> 02:50:31.688 region:rollup2
PRESUMING. THAT THE.

02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:34.658 region:rollup2
AS IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED

02:50:31.688 --> 02:50:36.093 region:rollup2
INCOMPETENT DANGERS POSITIONS A

02:50:34.658 --> 02:50:38.295 region:rollup2
MAY NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATE.

02:50:36.093 --> 02:50:40.363 region:rollup2
THESE ARE NECESSARILY RED FLAGS

02:50:38.295 --> 02:50:42.866 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO IS AN IMPLICATION

02:50:40.363 --> 02:50:43.467 region:rollup2
THAT PHYSICIANS ARE PRODUCTION

02:50:42.866 --> 02:50:44.134 region:rollup2
FOR MEDICINE AND THERE MAY NOT

02:50:43.467 --> 02:50:46.837 region:rollup2
BE TRUE.

02:50:44.134 --> 02:50:48.638 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN CURSES HIS HOUSE IN A

02:50:46.837 --> 02:50:49.940 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY.

02:50:48.638 --> 02:50:51.341 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED

02:50:49.940 --> 02:50:53.176 region:rollup2
ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDES

02:50:51.341 --> 02:50:54.611 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS USED TO SYSTEM THAT

02:50:53.176 --> 02:50:56.413 region:rollup2
DEPTH ELECTION HAPPENS WHO WE

02:50:54.611 --> 02:50:57.881 region:rollup2
COULD PROVIDE FEEDBACK.

02:50:56.413 --> 02:50:58.949 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS UNDERMINE ITS ABILITY

02:50:57.881 --> 02:50:59.983 region:rollup2
TO FUNCTION AT ITS HIGHEST

02:50:58.949 --> 02:51:01.451 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL AS A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:50:59.983 --> 02:51:03.220 region:rollup2
TOOL.

02:51:01.451 --> 02:51:04.421 region:rollup2
AND TO EFFECTIVELY MEET THE

02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:06.289 region:rollup2
NEEDS PROVIDERS WHICH IS COLONEL

02:51:04.421 --> 02:51:08.959 region:rollup2
TOO TO ENSURING THE SUCCESS OF

02:51:06.289 --> 02:51:10.026 region:rollup2
THE PRESCRIPTION MARKER PROGRAM.

02:51:08.959 --> 02:51:12.028 region:rollup2
WE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SAY

02:51:10.026 --> 02:51:14.064 region:rollup2
ISSUES ASSOCIATION STRONGLY

02:51:12.028 --> 02:51:15.732 region:rollup2
SUPPORT ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION

02:51:14.064 --> 02:51:15.966 region:rollup2
MONITORING PROGRAM IN SUPPORT TO

02:51:15.732 --> 02:51:18.535 region:rollup2
CURES.

02:51:15.966 --> 02:51:20.270 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. WE PREFER A BEHIND US

02:51:18.535 --> 02:51:22.005 region:rollup2
IN A NON LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY.

02:51:20.270 --> 02:51:22.839 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS SERVICES FUNCTION FOR

02:51:22.005 --> 02:51:24.641 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:51:22.839 --> 02:51:26.309 region:rollup2
AND I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME

LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE TO BE AT THIS

02:51:28.311 --> 02:51:32.382 region:rollup2
ROOM AND ABOUT TEN MINUTES OR SO

02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:33.617 region:rollup2
BUT. IF WE CAN COMING CATHOLIC

02:51:32.382 --> 02:51:34.751 region:rollup2
THIS COMES BY KNOW THAT MANY OF

DOCTOR DAVID RENDON.

02:51:42.492 --> 02:51:46.763 region:rollup2
ANY.

02:51:45.395 --> 02:51:48.799 region:rollup2
AS WE ARE THIS MORNING THE

02:51:46.763 --> 02:51:50.300 region:rollup2
OPIATE EPIDEMIC IS A BIG PROBLEM

02:51:48.799 --> 02:51:51.835 region:rollup2
IN THEIR STE NATION AND OUR

02:51:50.300 --> 02:51:53.136 region:rollup2
STATE. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN A BIG

02:51:51.835 --> 02:51:54.771 region:rollup2
ISSUE IN MY PROFESSION OF

02:51:53.136 --> 02:51:57.274 region:rollup2
OPTOMETRY.

02:51:54.771 --> 02:51:58.575 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS

02:51:57.274 --> 02:51:59.709 region:rollup2
OPTOMETRIST TO PRESCRIBE ONLY TO

02:51:58.575 --> 02:52:01.678 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.

02:51:59.709 --> 02:52:03.013 region:rollup2
HYDROCODONE TRAMADOL AND LIMITS

02:52:01.678 --> 02:52:04.848 region:rollup2
THE A PRESCRIPTION DATE TWO

02:52:03.013 --> 02:52:06.249 region:rollup2
THREE DAYS.

02:52:04.848 --> 02:52:07.450 region:rollup2
AN OPIATE PRESCRIPTION CAN BE

02:52:06.249 --> 02:52:09.286 region:rollup2
NEEDED BY AT TOM JUST PROPOSED

02:52:07.450 --> 02:52:10.987 region:rollup2
SURGICAL CONTROL PAIN AND TO

02:52:09.286 --> 02:52:12.923 region:rollup2
TREAT AYE INJURIES. THE MOST

02:52:10.987 --> 02:52:14.057 region:rollup2
OPTOMETRISTS MORE CALMLY MANAGE

02:52:12.923 --> 02:52:16.426 region:rollup2
THE PAIN WITH BANDAGE CONTACT

02:52:14.057 --> 02:52:18.428 region:rollup2
LENSES AND AL ANALGESICS LIKE

02:52:16.426 --> 02:52:20.063 region:rollup2
IBUPROFEN AND NAPROXEN.

02:52:18.428 --> 02:52:20.630 region:rollup2
OFTEN A MORE OBVIOUS IN

02:52:20.063 --> 02:52:22.566 region:rollup2
OPTOMETRY WHEN A PATIENT'S

02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:24.467 region:rollup2
CONDITION WOULD REQUIRE OPIATES

02:52:22.566 --> 02:52:26.469 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE PAIN IS PHYSICALLY

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:27.604 region:rollup2
NOTICEABLE. AS THE SHIP THEY

02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:29.105 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMETHING LIKE CORNEAL

02:52:27.604 --> 02:52:30.173 region:rollup2
ABRASION OR FOREIGN BODY IN

02:52:29.105 --> 02:52:31.975 region:rollup2
THEIR EYE.

02:52:30.173 --> 02:52:33.510 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THE DATA

02:52:31.975 --> 02:52:34.878 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE ON HOW OFTEN THAT TOM

02:52:33.510 --> 02:52:36.546 region:rollup2
JUST PRESCRIBE CONTROLLED

02:52:34.878 --> 02:52:37.447 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCES HOWEVER UNDER THE

02:52:36.546 --> 02:52:39.015 region:rollup2
MEDICARE SYSTEM IN TWENTY

02:52:37.447 --> 02:52:39.449 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN THERE WERE ABOUT FOUR

02:52:39.015 --> 02:52:41.017 region:rollup2
POINT THREE MILLION

02:52:39.449 --> 02:52:41.885 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIONS.

02:52:41.017 --> 02:52:43.687 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN BY

02:52:41.885 --> 02:52:44.754 region:rollup2
OPTOMETRISTS IN U. S. AND OF

02:52:43.687 --> 02:52:46.423 region:rollup2
THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY THREE

02:52:44.754 --> 02:52:47.991 region:rollup2
WERE FOR OPIATES.

02:52:46.423 --> 02:52:49.860 region:rollup2
THAT'S ZERO POINT ZERO THREE

02:52:47.991 --> 02:52:51.194 region:rollup2
OPIATE PRESCRIPTION RATE. AND

02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:52.963 region:rollup2
THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE THE NUMBER

02:52:51.194 --> 02:52:54.431 region:rollup2
OF YOUNGER PATIENT YOU MIGHT

02:52:52.963 --> 02:52:55.799 region:rollup2
HAVE WORK RELATED INJURIES THEY

02:52:54.431 --> 02:52:57.434 region:rollup2
CAN CAUSE PAIN BUT IT DOES

02:52:55.799 --> 02:52:59.336 region:rollup2
SUGGEST OVERALL WOULD

02:52:57.434 --> 02:53:00.637 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBING. LAPTOP PURCHASE IS

02:52:59.336 --> 02:53:02.405 region:rollup2
VERY LOW.

02:53:00.637 --> 02:53:04.007 region:rollup2
I DON'T TYPICALLY PRESCRIBED IN

02:53:02.405 --> 02:53:05.742 region:rollup2
IN MY PRACTICE

02:53:04.007 --> 02:53:07.143 region:rollup2
IN FACT IN PREPARATION FOR DID A

02:53:05.742 --> 02:53:08.345 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT FIND A PRACTICING UP

02:53:07.143 --> 02:53:09.880 region:rollup2
TOM JUST THAT HAD USED IN THE

02:53:08.345 --> 02:53:11.181 region:rollup2
CARE SYSTEM.

02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:12.482 region:rollup2
NEVERTHELESS THE AMERICAN

02:53:11.181 --> 02:53:14.684 region:rollup2
OPTOMETRIC ASSOCIATION HAS

02:53:12.482 --> 02:53:16.486 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

02:53:14.684 --> 02:53:18.021 region:rollup2
TO DOCTORS OF OPTOMETRY.

02:53:16.486 --> 02:53:19.956 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE ROLE IN PROTECTING

02:53:18.021 --> 02:53:22.425 region:rollup2
THEIR PATIENTS AND FOR RISKING

02:53:19.956 --> 02:53:23.894 region:rollup2
AN INAPPROPRIATE USE OF OPIOIDS.

02:53:22.425 --> 02:53:24.427 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME

02:53:23.894 --> 02:53:26.162 region:rollup2
SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE THIS

02:53:24.427 --> 02:53:26.730 region:rollup2
MORNING.

DISEASE THOUGH IT IT IS IT'S

02:59:25.788 --> 02:59:28.858 region:rollup2
VERY CONSISTENT WITH AN INTERNAL

MEDICINE APPROACH TO.

02:59:28.858 --> 02:59:32.295 region:rollup2
A INTRACTABLE DISEASE ENTITY TO

02:59:30.927 --> 02:59:34.464 region:rollup2
USE COMBINE TO MEDICATIONS.

02:59:32.295 --> 02:59:35.665 region:rollup2
NO.

02:59:34.464 --> 02:59:37.600 region:rollup2
S. ESPECIALLY A PAIN MEDICINE IS

02:59:35.665 --> 02:59:39.002 region:rollup2
INVOLVED OVER THE YEARS.

02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:40.570 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND WHAT'S

02:59:39.002 --> 02:59:41.771 region:rollup2
THE METRIC HOW DO WE MEASURE

02:59:40.570 --> 02:59:43.873 region:rollup2
BEAUSE IT'S EIGHT IT'S

02:59:41.771 --> 02:59:45.375 region:rollup2
INHERENTLY A SUBJECTIVE.

02:59:43.873 --> 02:59:47.043 region:rollup2
DISEASE PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU

02:59:45.375 --> 02:59:48.378 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY FEEL.

02:59:47.043 --> 02:59:49.712 region:rollup2
SO WEEK KNOWING TO RISE TO RIGHT

02:59:48.378 --> 02:59:51.281 region:rollup2
METRICS TO MEASURE THAT THE

02:59:49.712 --> 02:59:52.715 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THING IS A IS AN

02:59:51.281 --> 02:59:54.017 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT FUNCTION.

02:59:52.715 --> 02:59:55.885 region:rollup2
IN ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AN

02:59:54.017 --> 02:59:57.153 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL.

02:59:55.885 --> 02:59:58.888 region:rollup2
AYE ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING

02:59:57.153 --> 03:00:01.057 region:rollup2
TO IT MEASURE THAT.

02:59:58.888 --> 03:00:01.658 region:rollup2
AND WE JUST PRESCRIBE THE

03:00:01.057 --> 03:00:02.925 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF MEDICATIONS THAT WE

03:00:01.658 --> 03:00:03.760 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:00:02.925 --> 03:00:05.928 region:rollup2
YEAH.

03:00:03.760 --> 03:00:07.330 region:rollup2
CORRELATED WITH.

03:00:05.928 --> 03:00:08.931 region:rollup2
THAT BENEFIT FOR THE PATIENTS

03:00:07.330 --> 03:00:11.200 region:rollup2
NOW AS A CONSEQUENCE OF.

03:00:08.931 --> 03:00:13.036 region:rollup2
MORPHINE EQUIVALENT DOSAGES AND

03:00:11.200 --> 03:00:15.305 region:rollup2
AN ARBITRARILY CAPS BEING PLACED

03:00:13.036 --> 03:00:16.606 region:rollup2
ON PRESCRIBING.

03:00:15.305 --> 03:00:18.408 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN AN OVERWHELMING OF

03:00:16.606 --> 03:00:19.909 region:rollup2
PRESSURE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT

03:00:18.408 --> 03:00:21.144 region:rollup2
THE MEDICATION YOU'RE GIVING.

03:00:19.909 --> 03:00:23.212 region:rollup2
WHICH IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES

03:00:21.144 --> 03:00:24.881 region:rollup2
BURGER SOME PATIENTS GET BETTER

03:00:23.212 --> 03:00:26.749 region:rollup2
NAY SAYS I'M GLAD I MARK THIS

03:00:24.881 --> 03:00:27.850 region:rollup2
MEDICATION BUT NOT EVERYBODY.

03:00:26.749 --> 03:00:29.385 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBER PATIENTS DON'T DO

03:00:27.850 --> 03:00:31.821 region:rollup2
WELL.

03:00:29.385 --> 03:00:33.222 region:rollup2
AND ALSO LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT.

03:00:31.821 --> 03:00:34.524 region:rollup2
METHADONE MAINTENANCE.

03:00:33.222 --> 03:00:36.359 region:rollup2
WERE.

03:00:34.524 --> 03:00:38.695 region:rollup2
OPIATE USE DISORDER IS A HARM

03:00:36.359 --> 03:00:40.363 region:rollup2
REDUCTION STRATEGY.

03:00:38.695 --> 03:00:42.131 region:rollup2
ALSO ONE EMPHASIZING PEOPLE ARE

03:00:40.363 --> 03:00:43.132 region:rollup2
FINE IS AN OPIOID.

03:00:42.131 --> 03:00:44.200 region:rollup2
IT WAS OUR TAKING AWAY OPIOIDS

03:00:43.132 --> 03:00:47.370 region:rollup2
YOU ARE NOW INCOMPARABLE

03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:49.472 region:rollup2
DISEASES ALCOHOLISM WAS WAS.

03:00:47.370 --> 03:00:51.040 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ALCOHOLISM.

03:00:49.472 --> 03:00:52.942 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HIS CLASSIC FORMAT IS

03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:54.911 region:rollup2
AN ABSENCE

03:00:56.479 --> 03:01:00.783 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. SOME OF THE

03:00:57.814 --> 03:01:02.185 region:rollup2
NEWER MEDICATIONS LIKE VALTREX

03:01:00.783 --> 03:01:03.820 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S VERY

03:01:02.185 --> 03:01:06.055 region:rollup2
PROMISING NOW IN THE TREATMENT

03:01:03.820 --> 03:01:07.390 region:rollup2
OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IS

03:01:06.055 --> 03:01:08.024 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY NEW.

03:01:07.390 --> 03:01:09.525 region:rollup2
JERRY WE DON'T HAVE LONG TERM

03:01:08.024 --> 03:01:11.461 region:rollup2
DATA ON THAT.

03:01:09.525 --> 03:01:12.862 region:rollup2
AS A PAIN SPECIALIST USED TO

03:01:11.461 --> 03:01:14.363 region:rollup2
PUT OUR FEET FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT

03:01:12.862 --> 03:01:16.232 region:rollup2
IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR SOME

03:01:14.363 --> 03:01:17.533 region:rollup2
PATIENTS BUT LIKE WITH ANY OTHER

03:01:16.232 --> 03:01:19.302 region:rollup2
PHARMACEUTICAL.

03:01:17.533 --> 03:01:20.837 region:rollup2
ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL AND

03:01:19.302 --> 03:01:22.705 region:rollup2
THE BEAUTY OF OUR MEDICAL BOARD

03:01:20.837 --> 03:01:24.474 region:rollup2
TREATMENT GUIDELINES CITY ALLOWS

03:01:22.705 --> 03:01:25.975 region:rollup2
FOR INDIVIDUAL VARIATION. GROUP

03:01:24.474 --> 03:01:28.244 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THE HEALTHCARE

03:01:25.975 --> 03:01:29.912 region:rollup2
PROVIDER POSITION IN MY CASE

03:01:28.244 --> 03:01:31.581 region:rollup2
WITH THE PATIENT TO TAILOR THE

03:01:29.912 --> 03:01:32.849 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

03:01:31.581 --> 03:01:33.983 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PATIENT

03:01:32.849 --> 03:01:35.318 region:rollup2
BASED UPON THE METRICS WE TALKED

03:01:33.983 --> 03:01:36.652 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

03:01:35.318 --> 03:01:38.187 region:rollup2
USING KNICKERS IN SOME OF THESE

03:01:36.652 --> 03:01:40.123 region:rollup2
OTHER STUFF IS A COMPONENT TO

03:01:38.187 --> 03:01:42.125 region:rollup2
THE TREATMENT PLANT TO HELP US

03:01:40.123 --> 03:01:43.993 region:rollup2
BE CLINICALLY MORE EFFECTIVE.

03:01:42.125 --> 03:01:45.428 region:rollup2
IN MY PRACTICE BECAUSE OF THE

03:01:43.993 --> 03:01:46.028 region:rollup2
THE POLITICS OF WHAT'S GOING ON

03:01:45.428 --> 03:01:47.697 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY POLITICAL IN MANY

03:01:46.028 --> 03:01:49.699 region:rollup2
WAYS.

03:01:47.697 --> 03:01:51.267 region:rollup2
IT AS I'D EMPHASIZE YOU KNOW

03:01:49.699 --> 03:01:52.769 region:rollup2
WERE WERE WERE DIRECTING TOWARDS

03:01:51.267 --> 03:01:53.836 region:rollup2
ADDICTIVE.

03:01:52.769 --> 03:01:54.871 region:rollup2
THE ADDICTIVE PROBLEM THE OP

03:01:53.836 --> 03:01:56.773 region:rollup2
WAIT.

03:01:54.871 --> 03:01:58.541 region:rollup2
.

03:01:56.773 --> 03:01:59.942 region:rollup2
EPIDEMIC BUT KEEP IN MIND OUT OF

03:01:58.541 --> 03:02:01.077 region:rollup2
THE SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE

03:01:59.942 --> 03:02:02.445 region:rollup2
THAT DIED WHEN YOU PARSE THAT

03:02:01.077 --> 03:02:04.814 region:rollup2
DOWN.

03:02:02.445 --> 03:02:07.683 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TWO THIRDS OF IT IS.

03:02:04.814 --> 03:02:10.787 region:rollup2
PARA ONE AND FENTANYL.

03:02:07.683 --> 03:02:10.987 region:rollup2
SO IN IN A IN NO WAY DO I WANNA.

03:02:10.787 --> 03:02:12.522 region:rollup2
TWO.

03:02:10.987 --> 03:02:14.390 region:rollup2
DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:02:12.522 --> 03:02:16.192 region:rollup2
THAT'S OF THAT FACTOR.

03:02:14.390 --> 03:02:17.827 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU START DE

03:02:16.192 --> 03:02:18.895 region:rollup2
AGGREGATING THE DATA WE WOULDN'T

03:02:17.827 --> 03:02:20.296 region:rollup2
WE START LOOKING A PRESCRIPTION

03:02:18.895 --> 03:02:22.565 region:rollup2
USE.

03:02:20.296 --> 03:02:24.367 region:rollup2
DIVERSION OR ABUSE IT STARTS

03:02:22.565 --> 03:02:26.102 region:rollup2
COMING DOWN VERY VERY SMALL

03:02:24.367 --> 03:02:27.470 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF OF THE DESKS ARE FROM

03:02:26.102 --> 03:02:29.238 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THAT ARE TAKING THE

03:02:27.470 --> 03:02:31.374 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS AS PRESCRIBED.

03:02:29.238 --> 03:02:32.775 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT WAS MY MIND.

03:02:31.374 --> 03:02:34.310 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WHEN I TALK WITH THE

03:02:32.775 --> 03:02:35.378 region:rollup2
SENATE FOR DISEASE CONTROL WHEN

03:02:34.310 --> 03:02:36.813 region:rollup2
THEY CAME OUT THEY SAID WE'RE

03:02:35.378 --> 03:02:39.048 region:rollup2
NOT SPUR SPURS ARGO BICU IS AT

03:02:36.813 --> 03:02:41.884 region:rollup2
ALL WELL. AS AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST

03:02:39.048 --> 03:02:43.686 region:rollup2
IF WE DID MANAGE PER AB PAIN.

03:02:41.884 --> 03:02:45.555 region:rollup2
WELL PATIENTS WOULD HAVE

03:02:43.686 --> 03:02:47.323 region:rollup2
INCREASED INCIDENCE OF PNEUMONIA

03:02:45.555 --> 03:02:49.792 region:rollup2
THAT WOULDN'T HEAL AS WELL AND

03:02:47.323 --> 03:02:51.994 region:rollup2
ON AND ON SO EFFECTIVE ANALGESIA

03:02:49.792 --> 03:02:53.663 region:rollup2
WAS A CORNERSTONE OF ANESTHESIA

03:02:51.994 --> 03:02:55.231 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AND THAT'S AN ACUTE

03:02:53.663 --> 03:02:56.866 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

03:02:55.231 --> 03:02:58.067 region:rollup2
IN MY CLINICAL PRACTICE IT'S A

03:02:56.866 --> 03:02:59.135 region:rollup2
CHRONIC SITUATIONS IT'S A

03:02:58.067 --> 03:02:59.302 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ANIMAL.

03:02:59.135 --> 03:03:01.237 region:rollup2
BUT.

03:02:59.302 --> 03:03:02.071 region:rollup2
.

03:03:01.237 --> 03:03:03.139 region:rollup2
WE YOU KNOW WE ANSWERED A

03:03:02.071 --> 03:03:04.974 region:rollup2
QUESTION YOU KNOW WE ARE

03:03:03.139 --> 03:03:06.175 region:rollup2
REDUCING THE MEDICATIONS AS BEST

03:03:04.974 --> 03:03:06.843 region:rollup2
WE CAN BUT THERE ARE SOME

03:03:06.175 --> 03:03:08.311 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING.

03:03:06.843 --> 03:03:09.579 region:rollup2
COHORT OF PATIENTS THAT THAT'S

03:03:08.311 --> 03:03:10.179 region:rollup2
JUST NOT THE BEST MEDICAL

03:03:09.579 --> 03:03:12.782 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN AM ALL I WANNA DO

03:03:10.179 --> 03:03:14.116 region:rollup2
IS.

03:03:12.782 --> 03:03:15.585 region:rollup2
IS BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A

03:03:14.116 --> 03:03:17.220 region:rollup2
REASONABLE CARE BASED UPON THE

03:03:15.585 --> 03:03:18.821 region:rollup2
BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO US AT

03:03:17.220 --> 03:03:19.989 region:rollup2
THIS TIME AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE

03:03:18.821 --> 03:03:21.691 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO AN ARBITRATED

03:03:19.989 --> 03:03:23.326 region:rollup2
ARBITRARY DOSAGE OR COMBINATION

03:03:21.691 --> 03:03:25.061 region:rollup2
OF MEDICATIONS.

03:03:23.326 --> 03:03:26.796 region:rollup2
FOR A SELECT GROUP OF PATIENTS.

03:03:25.061 --> 03:03:28.698 region:rollup2
AS A PAIN SPECIALIST

03:03:26.796 --> 03:03:30.533 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S MY REQUEST

03:03:28.698 --> 03:03:32.368 region:rollup2
AND THEN AND I CAN CERTAINLY

03:03:30.533 --> 03:03:33.669 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S BEING.

03:03:32.368 --> 03:03:34.871 region:rollup2
WE KNOW OUR READY PEOPLE HEAL

03:03:33.669 --> 03:03:35.104 region:rollup2
FASTER IF THEY'RE NOT IN PAIN

03:03:34.871 --> 03:03:37.440 region:rollup2
IT'S FOR

03:03:35.104 --> 03:03:39.375 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION OF.

03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:40.643 region:rollup2
OF HOW YOU GET THERE. WITHOUT

03:03:39.375 --> 03:03:42.712 region:rollup2
CREATING OTHER.

03:03:40.643 --> 03:03:44.013 region:rollup2
SOCIAL PROBLEMS

03:03:42.712 --> 03:03:45.915 region:rollup2
AND THEN JUST RIVER I BY NO

03:03:44.013 --> 03:03:47.450 region:rollup2
ALMOST JUST ONE REAL QUICK

03:03:45.915 --> 03:03:48.885 region:rollup2
QUESTION I THINK A COUPLE OF YOU

03:03:47.450 --> 03:03:50.319 region:rollup2
MANDATE OF MENTIONED.

03:03:48.885 --> 03:03:51.954 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NO INTERSTATE

03:03:50.319 --> 03:03:53.723 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION AND AND MAYBE DOCTOR

03:03:51.954 --> 03:03:55.558 region:rollup2
DANTE CAN I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH

03:03:53.723 --> 03:03:56.726 region:rollup2
YOU SAID THIRTY NINE STATES USE

03:03:55.558 --> 03:03:58.761 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE CURIOUS BUT ARE

03:03:56.726 --> 03:03:59.695 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ANY OF THEM INTEGRATED

03:03:58.761 --> 03:04:02.265 region:rollup2
ACROSS.

03:03:59.695 --> 03:04:04.300 region:rollup2
BORDERS.

03:04:02.265 --> 03:04:05.534 region:rollup2
MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD.

03:04:04.300 --> 03:04:06.736 region:rollup2
I'M IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:04:05.534 --> 03:04:07.970 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT DO

03:04:06.736 --> 03:04:09.138 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME IMMIGRATION WE

03:04:07.970 --> 03:04:10.339 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DO NOT SO WE WOULD

03:04:09.138 --> 03:04:12.174 region:rollup2
LIKE TO LOOK INTO THAT AND HAVE

03:04:10.339 --> 03:04:13.342 region:rollup2
OUR STATE.

03:04:12.174 --> 03:04:14.810 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ARE SO CLOSE TO OTHER

03:04:13.342 --> 03:04:17.680 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORING STATES AND EVEN IN

03:04:14.810 --> 03:04:18.881 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO I PRACTICE AND I'M

03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:19.949 region:rollup2
THE RETAIL PHARMACISTS WHO

03:04:18.881 --> 03:04:21.417 region:rollup2
TRAVELS SO I DON'T HAVE A HOME

03:04:19.949 --> 03:04:22.919 region:rollup2
SITE.

03:04:21.417 --> 03:04:23.920 region:rollup2
I SEE PATIENTS FROM OTHER STATES

03:04:22.919 --> 03:04:24.420 region:rollup2
COMING INTO OUR STATE I DON'T

03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:26.289 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THEIR

03:04:24.420 --> 03:04:28.024 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

03:04:26.289 --> 03:04:29.859 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL AS A

03:04:28.024 --> 03:04:30.426 region:rollup2
PROVIDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

03:04:29.859 --> 03:04:31.661 region:rollup2
THEM WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE

03:04:30.426 --> 03:04:32.628 region:rollup2
CARE.

03:04:31.661 --> 03:04:34.096 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE HOW CLOSE WE

03:04:32.628 --> 03:04:34.997 region:rollup2
ARE TWENTY THREE STATES TO HAVE

WORKERS COMPENSATION PRACTICE

03:05:32.555 --> 03:05:35.091 region:rollup2
THERE'D BE A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF

03:05:34.357 --> 03:05:36.859 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:05:35.091 --> 03:05:37.960 region:rollup2
BUT IN MY THIRTY YEARS OF

GETS ALONG PRETTY WELL WITHOUT

03:05:48.371 --> 03:05:51.540 region:rollup2
HAVING TO GO TO THAT.

03:05:49.639 --> 03:05:54.276 region:rollup2
