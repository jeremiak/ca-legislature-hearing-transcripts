WANT TO SAY THANK YOU ALSO TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK BOTTOM LINE IS THIS MISTER CHAIR IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO BE TO DEVELOP A BROAD BASE FORMULA. THE FORMULA TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS. THOUSANDS OF THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN THE WILD IN URBAN INTERFACE. IN PROTECT AND PRODUCE A STABLE RESIDENTIAL INSURANCE MARKETS. CALIFORNIA FACES A TERRIFYING NEW REALITY IS. A GOOD SENATOR FROM NAPA IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH. WHEN IT COMES TO THE SIZE SCOPE AND DEVASTATION OF WILDFIRES. ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE AND THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED. THREE POINT SIX TO FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. WHO CURRENTLY LIVE WITHIN THE MOVIE THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. THAT'S ACCORDING TO OPR. MASON WILDFIRE RISK MODELS IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO MORE THAN ONE MILLION HOMES WITHIN THE WILL WE ARE IN A HIGH OR VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREA. INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING. IN THAT BEING ABLE TO EVEN ACCESS INSURANCE IS IN THE COMING MORE CHALLENGING TO OBTAIN FOR CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITHIN THE WOULD BE. APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN NON RENEWED BETWEEN THE FACT BY FIRES WHICH TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. SIDE 10% INCREASE IN NON RENEWALS RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS LOSING THEIR HOME INSURANCE. AND AS WE KNOW WHEN HOMEOWNERS ARE UNABLE TO SECURE INSURANCE THEY LOSE THE VALUE WITHIN THEIR PROPERTY. BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WAS A HUNDRED AND 77% INCREASE IN FAIR PLAYING A ROLE MEANT. IN THE STATE'S TEN HIGHEST RISK COUNTY. BUT USUALLY THE FAIR PLAN A IN AS WE ALL KNOW USUALLY THE FAIR PLAN IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND OFFERS A MINIMAL COVERAGE IN FAIR PLAN RATES CONTINUE TO RISE. POLICY HOLDERS ARE 20% AVERAGE RATE HIKE LAST YEAR WITH SOME HIGHER RISK PROPERTY SEEN AS MUCH AS A SIXTY NINE POINT RATE HIKE. THESE HOMEOWNERS IN HIGH FIRE RISK YEARS ARE OFTEN THE SAME RULE RESIDENTS. WHO ARE ELIMINATE OR FIXED INCOMES. HERE'S WHAT ELEVEN NINETY NINE DOES MISTER CHAIR AND EXPEDITE MY TESTIMONY. IT ESTABLISHES A NEW COMMISSION ON HOME HARDENING LED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. WITH TO RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING DEEPLY DRIVEN. IN SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND BEST PRACTICES FOR BOTH HOMEOWNERS COMMUNITIES. TO REDUCE THE RISK OF LOSS BOB MYERS. COMMISSION ON HOME HARDENING WILL ESTABLISH A TIERED SYSTEM FOR STANDARDS FOR PRIVATE FIRE PREVENTION. FOR VERY INDIVIDUAL HOMES THE STANDARD TO INCLUDE A VERY LEVELS OF HARDING INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR FLYING MEMBER RESISTANCE IN FOR FLAMING HEAT RESISTANCE. TO INCENTIVIZE HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE THE STEPS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE EXPENSIVE. AT THE THREE TIERS DIRECTLY LINKED TO INSURANCE DISCOUNTS FOR THE STRUCTURE CERTIFICATION. THE COMMISSION ON HOME HARDING WILL ALSO DEVELOP A CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR COMMUNITIES AS A WHOLE. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE RISKS OF WILD. FOR COMMUNITIES EARN SERVICE. INSURERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DENY COVERAGE FOR A RESIDENTS IN THAT COMMUNITY BASED ON WHAT FAR RISK. NOW THERE'S BEEN A HISTORY OF SUCCESS ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. FOR COMMISSIONS NOT EXACTLY LIKE THIS BUT CERTAINLY SIMILAR TO THIS. A SIMILAR COMMISSION WAS CREATED BY THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IN RESPONSE. TO AN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING STANDARDS IN REVIEWING HURRICANE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY INSURANCE RATES. THE CONGRESS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIFIC DISCOUNTS LISTED IN THE BILL AND THE REQUIREMENT ENSURES RULE- BE UNABLE TO DENY COVERAGE FOR RESIDENT. WHOSE HARD THEIR HOME UNDER THE STANDARDS AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT STAKEHOLDERS CONCERNS ARE ABOUT INSURING DISCOUNTS. THAT THEY REFLECT THE ACTUAL EDUCTION AND FIRE RISK IN THE DESIRE TO STILL HAVE THE BILLY DENY COVERAGE. AS A MEANS TO PREVENT INSURERS FROM BEING OVER EXPOSED IN HIGH RISK AREAS WE ALL WANT A HEALTHY COMPETITIVE INSURANCE MARKET NICHOLS ST. THAT WHERE THERE IS ACCESS IN CHOICE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL REFLECT OUR TEAM TO ENSURE THAT IF YOU'RE RESIDENTS WILL BE. IN THE TAKES STEPS INDIA AND BE ABLE TO HARD YOUR HOME BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC STANDARDS DEVELOPED BY THE COMMISSION. YOUR TURN RATES WOULD REFLECT YOUR INVEST. TO MAKE AS IN HOMA. FINALLY. THIS AMONG. YEP SENATE WHILE ACTION AND- DURING THESE DISCUSSIONS AND TO COME TO SAY. THANK YOU BEEN ON TO GET A WORK WE CENTER RUBIO. CHAIR OF INSURE ON THE SPECIFIC BILL.

BUT A- CHOOSE THE CREATION OF THE STATE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. COMPRISING OF STATE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF INSURANCE FIRE SAFETY BUILDING STANDARDS AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS TO DETERMINE BEST PRACTICES FOR HOME HARDENING AND WHILE FOR MEDICATION FOR IT WILL BE. SECONDLY DEVELOPMENT OF CLEARANCE AND STATEWIDE WILDFIRE COMMUNITY HARDENING STANDARDS.

FIRST OF ALL WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE. A HARD LOOK BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY OCCURRED ON HOME HARDENING THIS COMMISSION THAT. AGAIN SOMEONE INTO WHETHER APPROACH. WHAT OTHER DESIGN AND OTHER STATES WE HAVE NOTED TO THE AUTHOR AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OPENING UP PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE ALL RIGHT NOT THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS MERIT. PARDON ME BUT- ARE CONCERNED THAT ONCE PROPOSITION ONE THREE IS OPENED UP. THAT SOME OF THOSE WHO CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO SPELL- ARE HAVE A WHOLE LAUNDRY LIST OF CHANGES WHOLESALE CHANGES THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY ANTI CONSUMER AND ANTI POLICY HOLDER THAT THEY'D LIKE TO. IMPOSE ON THE BILL SO THAT CONCERT. FINALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A BOSNIAN OF THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMISSION- WE DO THINK THAT HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT YOU COMMISSION HAD TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY ARE WATER.

THE CENTER AND STAFF REACHING OUT AND THINK YOU THEY WANT THE BILL TO LOOK FOR WORK BUT WE HAVE NO OFFICIAL POSITION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. YOU MODERATE ARE THERE ANY OTHER CALLS. WE HAVE AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS LOOK AT FOR SOME HALF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY I JUST WANT TO OFFER OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR CENTER REQUIRES SB ELEVEN NINETY NINE WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE HIS EFFORTS AND YOUR EFFORTS- IN THE WILD HIGHER ISSUES AT THE END HI ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE AND MORE ON THAT. LATER. SOME THANKS FOR INTRODUCING THE UNDER MY- THE HUMAN BIRKS AB MA COULD YOU CHECK ONCE AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORT WITNESSES ON SB ELEVEN NINETY NINE. AND AS A REMINDER TO SHOW SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME AGAIN TO SHOW SUPPORT THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN THERE ARE AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE NO IN THE QUEUE AT THE MOMENT. HAVING HEARD FROM ALL THE SUPPORTERS WE WILL NOW FALL THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION LET'S BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE CHAMBERS WE DO HAVE- WITNESS A IN IN OPPOSITION. DANIELLE RITTER FROM WORKING PROPERTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION AND CENTER AND TAYLOR FROM THE PERSONALLY INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA THEY'LL BE SPEAKING IN ROOM. TWO OH FOUR OH YOU DIVERTED SO YOU'RE HERE THE CHAMBERS WELCOME. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF CERTAIN TAYLOR WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION. AND ALSO SPEAKING FOR THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES PADDOCK. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND THE ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS THAT EVERYONE IS TAKING HELP MAKE OUR DEMOCRACY KEEPER CAN SAFELY RESPECTFULLY WE MUST OPPOSE SB ELEVEN NINETY NINE. APPRECIATE CENTER REQUIRES A KNOWLEDGE MEANT OF OUR CONCERNS. WELL WE BELIEVE THE COMMISSION ON HOME HARDENING IS A VALUABLE COMPONENT OF ANY STRATEGY TO REDUCE RISK OF LOSS RELATED TO WILDFIRE. THIS BILL OVER REACHES BY IMPOSING PREMIUM DISCOUNTS BEFORE THE COMMISSION IS EVEN STARTED HIS WORK. IN ADDITION THE BILL FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE RECENT INSURANCE AVAILABILITY ISSUES IN HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO UNSUSTAINABLY LOW STATEWIDE AVERAGE PRICE LEVELS. WARNING TO THE MOST RECENT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS DATA. CALIFORNIA'S AVERAGE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE PREMIUM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT DOLLARS IS AN ALMOST ONE HALF THE AVERAGE PRICE IN HURRICANE STATES LIKE LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA. EVEN THOUGH TO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE TO REBUILD THE HOME OF THOSE LOWER COST GULF STATES. NOW ANY FEASIBLE SOLUTION TO THE INSURANCE AVAILABILITY CHALLENGES AND HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS MUST RECOGNIZE THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF LOW AVERAGE RATES AND THE TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF LOSSES INCURRED BY HOME INSURERS AS A RESULT OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES. WHICH AS NOTED BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICES DROVE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE LOS RATIONS TO THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. NOW FURTHER THIS BILL REQUIRES INSURERS TO PROVIDE GUARANTEED COVERAGE REGARDLESS OF RISK. IF AN INSURER HAS INADEQUATE RATES AND CANNOT MANAGE RISK THAT FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERMINES THE CONCEPT OF INSURANCE AND POSES SERIOUS SOLVENCY ISSUES. NO WELL WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB ELEVEN NINETY NINE WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT WILD FIRE RISK IN INSURANCE AVAILABILITY ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. WITH THAT IN MIND WE BELIEVE TO MEASURES CURRENTLY ADVANCING IN THE LEGISLATURE SB TWO NINETY TWO BY SENATOR RUBIO. AND AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY PROVIDING INNOVATIVE APPROACH THAT BALANCES INSURER RISK AND RATES. COMBINATION WITH A SUBSTANTIVE EFFORT TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISK AND LOSS AND IT'S AN APPROACH ENSURES CAN SUPPORT WITHOUT FEAR OF INSOLVENCY. NOW THE COMMISSION ON HOME HARDENING COULD BE A VALUABLE PART OF THAT SOLUTION. BUT THE INSURANCE PROVISION BILL ON WORKABLE FOR US SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU IS THE OTHER WITNESS- IN THE CHAMBERS YES PLEASE PROCEED. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DANNY WRITER ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION- APCA APPRECIATES THE ABILITY TO COMMENT ON SB ELEVEN NINETY NINE AND WE'RE STRONG SUPPORTER CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT WILDFIRES PRESENT. WERE ENCOURAGED THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS CONTINUED TO PRIORITIZE WILD FIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS IN THIS TRULY DIFFICULT TIME HOWEVER WE'D LIKE TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS FROM PET MUST OPPOSE SB ELEVEN NINETY NINE DUE TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT WILL THROW STABILITY IN THE INSURANCE MARKET.
