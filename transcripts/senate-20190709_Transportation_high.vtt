AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.579
BILL AGAIN WITH THE COALITION

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.547
FOR CLEAN AIR -- AND I THINK

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:35.682
YOU'RE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.550
IS REALLY VERY ACCURATE AND

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.252
ESPECIALLY WANT TO STRESS THIS

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.954
POINT THAT THE DEMAND FOR THE

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.222
REBATES IS OUTPACING AVAILABLE

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.791
FUNDING SO THE REBATE SHOULD

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.125
BE STRUCTURED OFFICIALLY TO

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.760
PRODUCE THE MOST BANG FOR STATE

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.563
PARKS AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.032
-- MAKE THE PROGRAM AS EQUITABLE

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.134
AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK THAT'S

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.703
THIS BILL GOES IN THAT DIRECTION

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.137
OF MAKING THE PROGRAM MORE

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:00.340
EFFECTIVE AND MORE EQUITABLE AND

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.774
AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.344
INCOME CAPS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.412
IN TERMS OF SAVING MONEY FOR THE

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.548
PROGRAM SO THAT SEE THE R. P.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.350
CAN LIVE WITHIN ITS MEANS AND

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.784
THE SAME TIME TRYING TO CHANNEL

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.353
THAT REBATE MONEY TO THOSE

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.954
PEOPLE WHO NEED THE REBATES

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.689
THE MOST AND WHOSE DECISION TO

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.358
BUY AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE WILL BE

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.393
MOST AFFECTED BY GETTING THAT

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.295
REBATE SO WE ACTUALLY THINK THE

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.931
INCOME CAPS ARE COULD BE LOWERED

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.733
FROM WHAT THEY ARE NOW AND

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.201
THE A. R. B. WOULD RETAIN THE

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.203
AUTHORITY TO INSTITUTE A LOWER

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.338
CAP WHICH STATE MAY NEED TO DO

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.241
-- AND ALSO WE AGREE THAT

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.676

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.279
SOME HAVE STRONGER BATTERIES

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.148
AND ARE ABLE TO GO FURTHER ON

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:43.750
ELECTRICITY AND THOSE ARE THE

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.551
ONES WE WANT TO INCENTIVIZE

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.745

THAT DOMAIN NAME IS A RACIST

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:29.413

SO THEY CEASE DOING AUDITS

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.228
BECAUSE THEY JUST FIND THAT

00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:45.329
THEY RANDOMLY WILL JUST KEEP

THINK THAT HAVING TO HAVE FIFTY

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:10.753
THERE CAN BE FRAGMENTATION THAT

IN MANY THINGS RELATED TO PUBLIC

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.764
TRANSIT THAT'S OFTEN A RESULT

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.666
OF -- DIFFERENCES IN RESOURCES

ALREADY SPEAKS TO THIS AND TO

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:39.548
THE EXTENT OF THE STATE WERE

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:41.417
TO TO REVISIT THIS IT OFTEN

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:43.419
WOULDN'T THEY WOULD LIKELY FIND

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:44.787
ON THE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.155
REALLY EXIST WITH THE RESOURCES

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:48.324
THAT TRANSIT AGENCIES HAVE NOT

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.725
NOT ANYTHING THEY'RE DOING OUT

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.994

SPEAK AND AGAINST THE BILL

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.069
I SEE NONE ABOUT OF QUESTIONS

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:02.204
FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:05.040
CENTER STONE AND THE SEARCH FOR

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:06.842
FOR THE OPPONENT I MEAN WHY NOT

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.310
JUST RE DEDICATE RESOURCES WERE

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.112
TALKING UP PEOPLE THAT -- ARE

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:12.014
SEVERELY DISABLED THAT NEED TO

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.549
GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B. AND

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:16.051

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:18.554
-- A NEED TO SEE TO TO APPROVE

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:20.656
SUCH TRANSFERS -- MEMBER

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:21.490
DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT YOU'RE

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:22.725
NOT COMING FORWARD IN TRYING

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.293
TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION AND

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.494
INSTEAD OF COMING UP HERE AND

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.196
AN OPPOSING GOOD BILL LIKE THIS

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:28.397
FOR NOW AND THAT'S THAT'S A

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:29.565
VERY FAIR QUESTION I THINK THAT

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:30.933
WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC TRANSIT

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.469
-- THE SERVICE JUST ALMOST

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:34.904
INHERENTLY IS ONE THAT IS UNDER

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.273
RESOURCE ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:38.974
IT COMES TO PARA TRANSIT -- AND

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:41.110
EDA A SERVICE THAT TENDS TO

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.144
BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE SERVICE

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:43.812
THAT WE ACTUALLY DO PROVIDE

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.281
HIGH TIMES IT CAN BE FORTY TO

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:47.449
FIFTY DOLLARS PER RIDE -- AND

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.485
SO AGENCIES DOING AS MUCH AS I

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.020
CAN WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:52.721
UNFORTUNATELY ARE ARE ARE GIVEN

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:54.523
-- OFTEN MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.625
-- RENEGE ON WHAT WHAT MIGHT BE

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:59.128
RESPONSIBILITIES -- -- THAT THAT

01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:00.162
THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:02.865
MADE ME SEE -- SEE FIT TO APPLY

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:04.600
THE ONE THING THAT WOULD NOTE

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.368
IS -- ONE THING THAT WE DID

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:07.937
OFFER AND I THINK YOU COULD

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:10.573
MAKE SOME SOME GOOD SENSE -- IS

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:11.674
JUST REQUIREMENTS THAT THERE'S

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.342
SOME MODERNIZATION WITHIN THE

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:16.078
PROCESS SEES THAT AGENCIES

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:18.247
-- TAKE ON AND AND -- THE AUTHOR

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.149
NOTED THAT FOR SOME AGENCIES IS

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:22.284
STILL RELY ON FAX MACHINES WE

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:23.519
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S AN OLD

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.120
FANGLED TECHNOLOGY IT'S GOING

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:26.822
TO BE INHERENTLY SLOW SO ONE

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.123
OF THINGS THAT WE HAD PRESENTED

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:30.292
EARLY ON IN THIS PROCESS --

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:31.660
WITH SHOULDN'T TO KIND OF A TWO

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:33.329
PART SOLUTION ONE WOULD BE TO

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:35.197
REQUIRE THAT TRANSIT AGENCIES

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:37.533
-- PRESENT ON THE WEBSITE

AND THROUGH THE TELEPHONE ON

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:41.737
THE EXACT TIME LINES AT THE

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:44.406
REQUIRE FOR PROCESSING --

01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:47.443
THESE -- THESE -- CERTIFICATIONS

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:50.346
BUT THEN ALSO -- REQUIRING

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:52.514
THAT THE EXCEPT THE PROOF OF

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.783
ELIGIBILITY -- VIA ELECTRONIC

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:09.431
PAST THERE YOUR COMMENTS AND

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:10.799
I THINK BY A PASSING THIS BILL

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:11.834
I THINK OF AGENCIES ARE GONNA

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.235
HAVE TO ADOPT PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:14.603
MORE HOMOGENEOUS THROUGHOUT THE

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.071
STATE AND AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.706
WE -- GIVE A HIGHER PRIORITY TO

THOSE THOSE -- DISABLED PEOPLE

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:20.409
TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:21.744
APPROPRIATE TRANSPORTATION NEEDS

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.312
MET GOING TO THE DOCTOR GOING

MORE SIX OF THEM AND WE HOPE IT

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:35.391

OF THE JUST JUST TO RESPOND

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:47.036
THING AND THEN ACTUALLY

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:49.271
DOING IT IS ANOTHER I THINK

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:52.041
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:53.809
HEAR FROM MY CONSTITUENTS

IT'S ALWAYS POLICIES

DOESN'T WORK RIVER THAT AS

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:10.693
WHAT THE POLICIES SAY --

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:01.021
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MEET

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:03.190
AND TO FIND A FUNDING SOURCE

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:05.493
BUT AGAIN -- IF IT TAKES LONGER

01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:06.894
I THINK IT'S TOTALLY FINE FOR

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.963
A RB TO DO THAT TO IDENTIFY THE

01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:11.198
SOURCE NOW OBVIOUSLY IN ORDER

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:14.068
TO UTILIZE ANY FUNDS TO UTILIZE

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.503
THE FUNDING MY EXPECTATIONS

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:16.337
THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK

01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:18.205
TO LEGISLATURE TO GET APPROVAL

01:36:18.272 --> 01:36:20.574
FOR THAT -- SO THAT'S TOTALLY

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:22.176
-- INCLUDED THE LEGISLATURE

01:36:22.243 --> 01:36:24.378
WILL OVERSIGHT OF ANY PLAN

01:36:25.412 --> 01:36:27.114
THAT COMES OUT OF THIS SO

01:36:27.648 --> 01:36:29.250
I THINK THAT GIVES US SO

01:36:30.217 --> 01:36:31.185
THE BALL COMES BACK ON OUR

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:32.453
CORD AFTER THEY COME UP WITH A

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:35.089
PLAN SEXUALLY AND AGAIN --

01:36:35.589 --> 01:36:37.892
WE WE DON'T PICK ANY

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:41.128
SITES IN THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:43.931
WHAT WE DO IS AGAIN THE

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:45.733
CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM

01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:48.102
HAS A CERTAIN SET STANDARDS

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:50.804
ON WHAT KINDS OF VEHICLES

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:53.274
FOUND AND SO WE HAVE NOT

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:56.310
SPOKEN ON THAT PARTICULAR SHOW

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:59.113
OKAY OKAY

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:01.448
THANK YOU -- DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:02.583
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:05.419
MEMBERS THERE'S A MOTION

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:07.521
QUESTION SIR GALGIANI

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:10.024
ORIGINALLY I WASN'T GOING TO

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.559
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:12.560
I AS I UNDERSTOOD IT THEY

01:37:12.626 --> 01:37:14.061
WOULD HAVE BEEN IFFY ON THOSE

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:16.197
WHO WERE DRIVING GAS DRIVEN

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:18.299
VEHICLES WHICH MANY ARE IN MY

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:19.833
AREA AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.735
BECAUSE THEY QUITE FRANKLY CAN'T

01:37:21.802 --> 01:37:24.171
AFFORD ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:25.539
DON'T HAVE THE CREDIT RATINGS

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:26.840
WITH THE CREDIT ABILITY TO

01:37:26.907 --> 01:37:28.776
BUY AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND

01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:30.578
SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZED BECAUSE

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:31.512
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:34.548
COMMUTE TO THE JOBS RICH AREAS

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:37.117
-- IN YOUR DISTRICT BUT NOW THAT

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:38.385
YOU'VE CHANGED THE BILL I WILL

01:37:38.452 --> 01:37:39.887
BE SUPPORTING IT BUT IT'S WITH

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:41.722
THE CAVEAT THAT YOU HAVE MADE

01:37:41.789 --> 01:37:42.990
THAT CHANGE SHOULD HAVE MADE IT

01:37:43.057 --> 01:37:45.392
CLEAR THAT THAT MY CONSTITUENTS

01:37:45.459 --> 01:37:47.094
CONSTITUENTS WON'T BE PAYING THE

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:49.563
PENALTY ABSOLUTELY NOT THAT'S

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:50.798
WE WANT TO TAKE THAT LANGUAGE TO

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:53.100
CLARIFY WE UNDERSTAND THERE ARE

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:55.436
SOME ISSUES AROUND HOW TO

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:57.805
INVOLVED WORKING CLASS FAMILIES

01:37:58.072 --> 01:37:59.473
-- MORE LOWER INCOME FAMILIES

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:01.942
IN THIS PROGRAM WHAT I WOULD

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:03.344
SAY THAT THAT IS THERE THERE

01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:05.746
IS A -- A CASH FOR CLUNKERS

01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:07.781
PROGRAM WE'VE ALSO CONSIDERED

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:10.150
-- SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN THIS

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.319
PROGRAM TO INCLUDE USED VEHICLES

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.154
I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:17.224
MANY WORKING FAMILIES THOSE

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.726
HOUSEHOLDS DON'T NECESSARILY BUY

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:20.594
USED CAR BUY NEW CARS THEY BUY

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:22.396
USED CARS YES SO THIS IS A NEW

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:24.498
CAR PROGRAM IS OBVIOUSLY I THINK

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:26.133
THERE'S DEFINITELY INTERESTED

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.002
OPENNESS ON MY END TO CONTINUE

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:29.336
THAT DIALOGUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:31.705
CAN WE BETTER SERVE A USED CAR

01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:33.474
MARKET BECAUSE THE GREAT THING

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.142
ABOUT NOW THAT WE HAVE CARS

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:37.244
THAT HAVE BEEN ON BEEN OUT FOR

01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:38.445
A NUMBER OF YEARS YOU NOW HAVE

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:40.180

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:41.415
YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO YOU

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:42.616
DIDN'T HAVE THE USED CAR MARKET

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:43.851
BECAUSE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:45.352
WAS NEW SO I THINK IT IS AN

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:47.087
OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE OUT AGAIN

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:49.923
HOW TO -- PROVIDE A BROADER

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.525
INCOME SPECTRUM SO I THINK WE'RE

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:52.593

01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:56.343
IT'S A WIN WIN SO THE TOURIST

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:57.478

IT'S A MUCH SAFER ENVIRONMENT

01:42:08.722 --> 01:42:10.123
BECAUSE WHAT THE RESERVATION

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:12.159

STREET IS NOT A VERY SAFE PLACE

01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:46.894
