LONG TIME TENANTS- MY FAMILY'S

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:37.476
BEEN LIVING IN OUR HOUSE IN

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:39.344
SOUTH PASADENA FOR THE LAST

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:41.813
TWENTY YEARS AND I OPPOSE THIS

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.750
BILL I THINK IT'S- INFURIATING

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:48.754
IT'S FRUSTRATING- AFTER-

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.956
GROWING UP. WITH SO MANY

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.692
TENANTS WHO HAD TO FIGHT FOR

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:56.194
THEIR HOME A LOT OF THOSE

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:59.097
TENANTS ARE OLDER AND HAVING TO

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:01.500
FEED THEIR GRIEVANCES HAVING TO

SEE THERE ARE PEOPLE PASSING

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:07.039

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:09.841
BE CONSULTED BY MISTER MIRACLE

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:12.244
IS VERY INFURIATING AND

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:15.681
RIDICULOUS. SO I THINK IT'S-

00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:17.082
IT'S RIDICULOUS ALSO THAT THERE

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:19.718
IS- AND A GROUP CALLED THE

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.920

POLITICAL PROPERTIES AND REACH

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:39.538
READ- RESTORED THEN SO THAT IS

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:41.740
BY THE TENANTS AND A LOT OF THE

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:43.408
INFORMATION THAT SHE SAID WAS

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:45.344
THE FIRST TIME EVER HEARING
