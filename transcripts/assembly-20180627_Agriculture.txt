LET'S STUDY LISTEN LET'S COMMERCIALIZES BASS WAS POSSIBLE THANK. WE'VE VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SINGMAN ALL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE HAVE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] YES. REALLY. YEAH WHAT IS THE RIGHT TALK OFF ALPHA IN YOUR DISTRICT WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT THE RIGHT -- CLIMB IT -- FOR GROWING ALFALFA BUT YOU KNOW WE DO AMAZING THINGS WATER TO IT TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO GROW THEIR WHAT WE'RE WOOD. NON. AND BE GROWN IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE IT THE IDEAL PLACES FOR THAT. IT CAN BE GROWN IS BASICALLY A WEED SO IT CAN REALLY BE GROWN LITERALLY ANYWHERE -- WHICH IS WHAT WOULD WHICH Y. MAKES IT SO ATTRACTIVE I THINK THERE'S A LARGE SWATHS OF LAND IN. IN ASSEMBLYMAN SALAS IS DISTRICT THAT COULD CONVERT FROM COTTON -- TO TED TO HAND AND THE THING ABOUT THAT YOU CAN USE THE WHOLE EVEN USE ENTIRE PLAN FOR SO MANY PRODUCTS. AND SO I KNOW -- THIS BILL ACTUALLY CAME TO ME FROM MY LOCAL FARMERS THE LA COUNTY FARM BUREAU HAS ENDORSED OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THEY CAME BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY BECAUSE THEY JUST GONNA GETTING WATER RIGHTS AND AT THAT COMMITTEE WAS A BIG LOSER AND THEY'RE GETTING THEIR WATER SUPPLY CUT BY 44% OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THEY CAN'T SUSTAIN AN AGRICULTURAL LIFESTYLE DOING ALFALFA SO THEY WANT TO CONFER -- TED TO INDUSTRIAL HEMP AND THEN I'VE HAD MANUFACTURES A CALM THAT SAY HEY. IF IF THIS LIKE PASSES WE ARE GOING TO COME AND WE'RE GONNA PUT FACTORIES IN YOUR DISTRICT BECAUSE WE WANT THAT BECAUSE NOW THEY IMPORTED FROM OUT OF STATE -- THAT'LL BE ABLE TO SAVE THEM SAVE THEM COSTS I THINK I'VE SEEN AS A WIN WIN. NXP COMMENTS ON THE SCALE OF FARMING THAT WOULD BE ENGAGED IN THE US -- I'M I'M I'M HAPPY I'M HAPPY TO HAVE WE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS. HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT THAT DIALOGUE BECAUSE AGAIN. I I COULD BE WRONG I THINK LONG TERM DID THIS IS A MORE OF MUCH MORE LUCRATIVE -- CROP TO GROW THEN THEN CANNABIS SO. THIS PARTICULAR CROP AND IT DON'T MEAN TO SPEAK FOR YOU BUT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A NUMBER OF HEMP GROWERS IN MY LOCAL REGION IS WHILE AND IT'S GOT. IT'S GOT MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS THAT ARE PRETTY WIDESPREAD AND SO THE ABILITY TO USE IT IN. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT -- APPLICATIONS MEANS THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY MANUFACTURE THINGS WITH IT -- SO I THINK IT'S GOT IN AND WHAT I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT AND I LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A CO AUTHOR ABSOLUTELY. EVER DO AN AMENDMENT BUT THE PIECE THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT IS THAT -- IT'S GOT APPLICATIONS AS A FOOD PRODUCT AS A FIBRE. AS THE IT EVIDENTLY YOU CAN MAKE IT INTO ALMOST LIKE A FIBERGLASS TAKE OUT OF OF MATERIAL. AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE -- THAT IT IT IS GROWN IN. IS I THINK PARTICULARLY EXCITING IS PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE NITRATE ISSUES IN THAT TREE. CONTAMINATION YOU CAN BRING UP THAT WATER PUT IT ON THE GROUND OR TAKE IT OUT OF THE GROUND. AND UP AND DO CLEAN UP IN A WAY THIS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE SOAP BUT YEAH THAT'S GREAT MEN ATTRACTED TO THE POINT THAT I WANTED TO TO GET TO WERE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION -- THAT LIKE TO DO ALL THE BENEFITS THAT YOU FIND COULD BE POSSIBLE. WITH THIS B. BROWN OF THE SCALE ATTACKS WE HARNESS THOSE BENEFITS AND DAD IN AND WHY ARE THOSE CONCERNS OUT THERE. I DO WITH THAT THE LAST GROUP I'VE NOT I HAVE NOT SPOKEN WITH THIS THE FIRST TIME I'M HEARING IT'S I DON'T KNOW THEY'VE. SPOKEN MY STAFF NOT IT NOT AWARE. BUT YOU COULD GO MASKING ALSO LIKE IF YOU PURCHASE A BMW THAT'S MANUFACTURED IN EUROPE THE SKINS IS MADE OUT OF HIT BECAUSE THE FIBER SO STRONG SO LIGHT SO IT IS LIKE FIBERGLASS. HOW THEY DON'T USE CONCRETE IN EUROPE THEY USE HIM CREATE IS STRONGER THAN CONCRETE AND IT'S A QUESTIONS CAR BEEN? YEAH OUT THERE USING THE FIBER IN CANADA FOR FOR BUILDING INSULATION BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE TEMPERATURE IS OUTSIDE IT'S SEVENTY DEGREES INSIDE ALL THE TIME. ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT THAT WE KNOW ABOUT SO A LOT OF MANUFACTURING -- OPPORTUNITIES WITH WITH HIM. SO WHERE YOU WHERE YOU IT ASKING THE QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE BILL THAT LIMITS. THERE'S LIMITATIONS UPON MATH FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALUM LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIMITATION I I WAS JUST. ASKING TO HAVE CLARIFICATION ON WHAT THE OPPOSITION BUT YEAH THAT THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE BILL I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT. YOU FOR FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING AYE CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE SUPPORTING AYE THAT TENTH OF AN ACRE LIMITATION IS FROM THE LENO LEGISLATION THAT'S B. FIVE SIXTY SIX FROM A FEW YEARS AGO AND ACTUALLY PART OF THE REFORM THAT'S TAKING PLACE HERE IS REMOVING SOME OF THOSE LIMITATIONS. AND BRINGING STATE LAW INTO ALIGNMENT WITH FEDERAL LAW AND THAT SORT OF OPENING THE GATES HERE. THANK YOU JOHN YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS BECAUSE THIS WAS GOING THROUGH IT TED TO ACCOMMODATE YOU IS IT THAT WE ALSO ARE TAKING ALL THE UPDATES HAT WERE IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FEDERAL FARM ACT. SO IN THE OTHER THIS INTERESTING SO ABOUT A MONTH AGO IN THIS HARD TO BELIEVE BUT SENATOR MCCONNELL. AND SENATOR SCHUMER ACTUALLY JOINTLY AUTHORED A BILL TO MAKE INDUSTRIAL HAPPEN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS SET A SCHEDULE. ONE SO THIS OF THIS MOVING VERY FAST AND WE WILL I THINK WE WANT TO BE OUT FRONT ON IT. SO WE CAN HAVE OUR OUR FARMERS GROWING AND THAT OUR MANUFACTURERS COMING IN BEHIND IT. IT'S GREAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD -- OKAY I THINK THEIR WORDS AND IT IT AN ADDITION ONTO A COMMENT. YES I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A REBUTTAL JUST TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TRIED TO SPEAK WITH YOUR STAFF ESPECIALLY PERTAIN TO THIS BILL MULTIPLE DIME SO PERHAPS IF YOU COULD RECOLLECT WITH THEM LOCKED UP RIGHT NOW. ABSOLUTELY AND WHAT I LIKE TO SAY ESPECIALLY IS WHY THE MAIN CONCERNS IS THAT IS SCRIPTED WITH SOME LANGUAGE FROM MAC FEDERAL MANDATES BECAUSE ONCE YOU GO INTO A FEDERAL MANDATE UNLESS. FOR CLARIFYING WITH WHAT WAS JUST DECIDE BY THE FDA NAMED WERE EVEN DOING WITH THAT WITH CANNABIS AND BANKING CABS AND TAXATION ONCE YOU START BUYING THE WATER'S TOO MUCH WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN FEDERAL COMPLIANCE. THEN THAT'S WHERE WE AS A STATE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH OBVIOUSLY UNLESS IT'S TAKING OFF OUR UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ACCESO FOR RIGHT NOW WE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE MANY CONCERNS WE HAVE. IS TO STAY WITH THEM WHAT OBVIOUSLY IS WE OUGHT TO BE STIPULATED WITH COMMERCIAL CANNABIS AS A WHOLE MAJESTIC KEEP THAT CONSISTENCY IN THAT LEVEL FOR WHAT WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW AS SO THANK YOU FOR MY COMMENT THANK YOU. SHE TO VERY MUCH. YEAH SENATOR HAVE DOES NOT KILL YOU YOU MAKE YOU MAY CONCLUDE. YEAH AGAIN -- AT THANK YOU FOR THE CONSIDERATION.

WHEN THOMAS JEFFERSON WAS DRAFTING THE WE AT THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE HE DID THAT ON HEMP PAPER? SO ALL THIS BILL DOES IS BRING BRING AMERICA BACK TO ITS FUTURE AND THAT'S THAT'S INDUSTRIAL HEMP AS NOTED SIX BY SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. THAT WE CAN HAVE HERE IN OUR STATE SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THE GOLDEN STATE'S CATTLE MARKET IS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE IN THE NATION. WITH SMALL FAMILY ORGANIC FARMERS IN LARGER PRODUCERS WHO SERVE CONSUMERS WITH A RANGE OF TASTES. I AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA DOES BUSINESS A BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER STATES AND IS THAT DIFFERENCE HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE THAT CALIFORNIA CATTLE FAMILIES ARE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT THERE THE LEADING THE NATION REDUCING THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT. WE'VE DISTRICT IS CLEAN AIR AND WATER LAWS IN AMERICA RIGHTFULLY SO. IN CALIFORNIA'S CATTLE RANCHES AND AREAS ARE TACKLING CLIMATE POLLUTANTS BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE FUTURE OF THE STATE. IN THEIR INDUSTRY. THAT SAID CALIFORNIA'S CATTLE RANCHERS ARE DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AN ABILITY TO TELL THE STORY TELLER STORY OF AN INDUSTRY THAT IS DOING RIGHT BY THE ENVIRONMENT. AND GIVING THE CONSUMER A CHOICE AT THE DEMAND. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A STATE ENTITY TO BE ABLE TO PROMOTE OR CONDUCT RESEARCH SPECIFICALLY. FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE CATTLE INDUSTRY. THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO WHAT ALREADY EXISTS WITH OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE FOR EXAMPLE FRUITS AND VEGGIES. I WHO HAVE THEIR OWN CD NITTY. IT'S BEEN NINE SIXTY FIVE ALLOWS FAMILY CATTLE RANCHERS THE RIGHT TO VOTE DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLE COUNCIL. WHICH WILL UTILIZE FUNDS COLLECTED THROUGH A REFUNDABLE ASSESSMENT OF ONE BOOK PER HEAD OF CATTLE SPECIFICALLY FOR CATTLE RESEARCH. EDUCATION AND PROMOTION ON THE RAISING OF CALIFORNIA BEEF AND DAIRY. OUR BIGGEST STRENGTH. OUR DIVERSE CATTLE MARKET. WITH OUR SMALL FAMILY FARMERS A LARGE PRODUCERS HIGHLIGHTS A GREATER NEED FOR THE SPATE THE STATE'S PACIFIC RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. THEY NEED ENHANCE RESEARCHING HOW THEY CAN MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS ON WATER SUPPLY THROUGH A DROUGHT OR HOW. TO FURTHER REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS S. B. NINE SIXTY FIVE IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING THAT WE GIVE OUR CATTLE PRODUCERS THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO THRIVE. IN THE EVER CHANGING INDUSTRY. THIS BILL ROUS AS WE SEE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND WILL NOT RESULT IN ANY ADDITIONAL STATE COSTS REALLY GRATEFUL MADAM% CHAIR THAT WE HAVE. TWO FANTASTIC FAMILY CATTLE RANCHERS HERE WE'VE CODING NICHOLSON STRATTON A SMALL FAMILY RANCHER A FOGGY BOTTOM FARMS AND LOVES JERSEYS MY GOODNESS IN AND OUT WILL NOT A SHOWING THE FOR HOSTING -- HE IS FROM AT FERNDALE AND FOR THE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF HIS WORK ON THIS.

B. -- NINE SIXTY FIVE I HAVE A AT MODEST SIZED FAMILY CATTLE RANCH THAT I OWN AND RUN IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY NOW FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS WE'RE GOING ON THE FOURTH GENERATION. WE SAID IN THAT. OF SOUTHEASTERN CORNER OF CINEMA COUNTY. AND I WILL SAY TO VERY BEAUTIFUL AREA. WE PRIDE THE MAYBE THE ONLY AND THE BIGGEST CATTLE RANCH SURE FOR MANY MILES AROUND US BUT OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SEEN THAT -- THOUGH LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY IN THE CATTLE INDUSTRY CHANGE -- WE'VE CHANGED OUR CATTLE RANCH WITH IT -- MY FATHER STARTED WITH AN FFA PROJECT IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX WENT ON TO DEVELOP A VERY WELL THOUGHT OF HER TO BEAR* COWS WE'VE CHANGED TO BEEF CATTLE BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A IN A MORE HILLY ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S MORE SUITABLE. TO TO THE BEEF COWS IN THE DAIRY COWS THAT WE HAD SO WE'VE CHANGED TO BEEF CATTLE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN OVER THERE. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. WELL IT'S BEEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW WE'VE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM WITH THE BEAR REPUBLIC BREWING COMPANY -- WE'VE FEED THEIR SPENT GRAIN WERE UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS A SPENT GREEN SIX DAYS A WEEK. THAT WE PICK UP FROM THEM SO WHERE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR POPULAR OF THEIR PRODUCTION FACILITY. WE FEED THAT TO OUR CALVET WE'VE NOW DEVELOPED A GONE A LITTLE MORE TO THE NICHE MARKET -- WE APPRECIATE THIS BILL IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAND BEHIND IT -- WE THINK ESPECIALLY BEING VOLUNTARY -- AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL THAT WE CAN GET BEHIND IS CATTLE PRODUCERS OF MANY OF THAT. COUNTIES AND THAT THE CATTLE PEOPLE WE HAVE I THINK THREE HUNDRED OR SO ON BOARD TWENTY TWO COUNTIES FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SOCI ASIANS IN THE COUNTY SO.

PUTTING ROTATIONAL GRAZING TARGETED STOCKING DENSITIES AND UNDERSTAND PLANT COMMUNITIES AND BIOLOGICAL PASSED AND WE'D MANAGEMENT. WE MANAGED TO IMPACT OUR LAND AND ENVIRONMENTALLY. BENEFICIAL MANNER TODAY I'M SPEAKING TO YOU ON BEHALF OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN OF THE CALIFORNIA DAIRY INDUSTRY. THAT WITH WESTERN UNITED DAIRY MEN AND THE MANY INDIVIDUALS THERE IS ACROSS THE STATE THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS BIT OF IMPORTANT LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THE NATION'S LEADING DAIRY STATE. RANKING FIRST IN THE US IN THE PRODUCTION OF TOUCH. NONFAT DRY MILK WAVE AND WE PROTEIN CONCENTRATE. THE GROWING DEMAND FOR DAIRY PRODUCTS LIKE CHEESE AND YOGURT AS WELL AS A STRONG VERY EXPORT. ACCOUNTS FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND JOBS THAT ARE DEPEND ON THE STATE'S MILK PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA DAIRY PRODUCERS ARE THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY PROGRESSIVE IN THE NATION ARE HELD TO A HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL ANIMAL HEALTH. LAND AND WATER STANDARD THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES THE DAIRY INDUSTRY WILL BE REDUCING ITS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH S. B.. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BY 40%. AND SENATE BILL NINE SIX FIVE WOULD ALLOW DAIRY PRODUCERS TO CONDUCT RESEARCH TO HELP THE INDUSTRY CONTINUE TO MEET THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS STANDARDS WHILE MAINTAINING ARE INDUSTRIES ECONOMIC VIABILITY. THIS LEGISLATION HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED IT PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DAIRY PRODUCERS LIKE MYSELF. TO DECIDE WHETHER NOT TO ASSESS THEMSELVES IN CREATING THE CALIFORNIA CATTLE COUNCIL. ANY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER LARGER SMALL CONVENTIONAL OR ORGANIC HAS ONE VOTE AND IF THE PRODUCER WISHES TO NOT SUPPORT THE CATTLE COUNCIL THEY CAN OBTAIN A REFUND NO QUESTIONS ASKED. CALIFORNIA'S ORGANIZE DAIRY PRODUCERS ARE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH THE COUNCIL AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M AT THE ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. NO WELL KRAMER'S CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION IT IT HAS A CHI ALLEN AYE RESIDENT OF HUMBOLDT COUNTY -- WATCHING THIS BILL VERY CLOSELY -- WITH AN AYE FOR HOW CAN HELP AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS IT'S AN EXCITING WORK AND I AS A PERSON RESIDENT CALIFORNIA PLEASED TO SUPPORT A TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. NOT OPPOSITION ON THE SHUTTLE LIKE OF ON BEHALF OF THE U. COMMITS SIDE KNIGHTED STATES WE WERE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BUT WANT TO THANK THE OFFICE OFFICE AND SPONSOR FOR VERY. COLLABORATIVE AND PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT TO AMEND THE BILL -- TO REFERENCE GRASS FED INSTEAD OF GRASS FINISHED AND ALSO A SMALL CLARIFICATION THAT IT IS NOT THE COUNCIL'S INTENT TO ENGAGE IN LOBBYING ACTIVITIES. WITH THOSE TWO AGREEMENTS THE HUMAN SIDE OF UNITED STATES WOULD REMOVE HIS OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION OR ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. FOR ANYBODY THAT JUST WANTS TO TALK. KP SAYING NONE OF WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. THE ONLY QUESTION I HAD IS WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE BEEN AN OPT -- AB EIGHT IN OPT OUT FOR AN OPT IN. JUST SO THAT YOU'RE NOT HAVING TO THE AYE AYE I UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE CRITICISMS WAS -- GETTING HAVING READ THE REFUNDS AND HOW THAT WOULD IT'S A PROCEDURAL ISSUE MORE THAN ANYTHING IT'S NOT. DOESN'T AFFECT THAT THAT THE BILL I THINK IT'S A I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN THE INDUSTRY COMES FORWARD AND SAYS LOOK WE'RE WILLING TO PAY -- A BUCKHEAD AND IN ORDER TO GET THIS KIND OF WORK DONE I REALLY APPRECIATED AND THAT'S VERY POWERFUL -- I'M JUST WONDERING IF PROCEDURALLY THERE'S A DO YOU. TO DECIDE HOWEVER IT IS THAT. MECHANICALLY IT WOULD WORK. THERE WAS JUST AN OBJECTION AND I WONDERED IF THERE WAS A BETTER WAY TO DO IT. NOT ABSOLUTELY IT'S IT'S AN ITEM THAT I AM BEING VERY HONEST MADAM CHAIR IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED QUITE A BIT -- IN THIS IS AN ITEM THAT DIGESTION FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN HOT TACKLING SINCE LAST YEAR. WE BELIEVE. THAT THIS IS THE BEST OPTION. FOUR CAROL FAMILIES NO MATTER IF YOU'RE DAIRY FARMER -- OR YEAR RAISING AYE CATTLE FROM ME. ON IT INSURERS AT MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION. AND I THINK THE PROVISION OF ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS WHO DON WHO DO NOT ONE OF THE OTHER PARTICIPATE A FULL REFUND. AYE IS THE BEST APPROACH LONG TERM FOR THIS INDUSTRY ABOUT OUTLET AT JUSTIN ASSELIN TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK AS JUSTIN BECAUSE HE'S BEEN -- AN HONEST BROKER ALL THE WAY THROUGH IN WORKING WITH US IN SO MANY HAD TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR -- AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE JUST ALL FILLED WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION. EXCUSE ME -- SO I WOULD SAY QUICKLY FOR FOR TWO REASONS ONE NO OTHER COUNSELOR COMMISSION HAS AN OPT IN PROVISION. THAT IN FACT THERE'S ONE OTHER THAT HAS A REFUND -- BUT SECOND IT'S LARGELY BASED ON HOW OUR INDUSTRY WORKS -- WE'VE GOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF OUR INDUSTRY IT'S NOT VERTICALLY INTEGRATED LIKE FARMING RETAKE THE PLAN OUT OF THE FIELD TO THE CRAP OUT OF A FIELD OF SLAVERY PACKAGE THAT. CATALOG TRANSITION YOU KNOW -- OWNERSHIP MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THEY'RE HARVESTED AND SO THAT DOLLARS COLLECTED AT CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP -- WE FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT HOW THE REFUND -- IN PLACE BECAUSE THE REFUND CAN BE HELD CONFIDENTIAL IF IT'S COMING FROM THE CATTLE COUNCIL RATHER THAN COMING FROM A PRIVATE ENTITY IF WE WERE TO DO IT OFTEN MOST CATTLE OR ARE YOU KNOW AS THROUGH THIS TRANSITION PROCESS ARE TAKEN TO A LIVESTOCK AUCTIONEER. AND ARE SOLD TO A PRIVATE ENTITY A PRODUCER WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THAT AUCTIONEER AND SAY I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THIS SO WITH HOLD MY MONEY. AND ADOPT POINT TIME THAT INFORMATION IS NOT CONFIDENTIAL SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE REFUND PROVISION IS IMPORTANT. WE EXPECT NOT A LOT OF PRODUCERS TO USE IT BUT OUR FOLKS DO WANT THAT BAILABLE WE THINK IT WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS TO SAY. YOU HAVE TO OUT YOURSELF IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IN THIS CASE EVEN GET THREE FIVE CONFIDENTIAL. AND YOU KNOW IT THAT THAT'S UP TO YOU THERE'S O DISCOURAGING AT TO USE IT AT THAT POINT SOMEHOW THAT'S HELPFUL THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I PREACH. OVER THE BILL [inaudible] IF YOU.
