THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I GET AFTERNOON WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CALL THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE. GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE TO ORDER THIS IS THE HEARING THE OVERSIGHT HEARING OF THE- ON FOR THIS HEARING WILL DISCUSS FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE HONOR AUDIT REPORT RELEASED IN MAY OF THIS YEAR. TITLED BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION. THEIR LICENSING PROCESSES ARE INEFFICIENT AND FOSTER UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF APPLICANTS WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR REQUESTING THIS AUDIT. WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROLS AND THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSIONS PLAN TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES IN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS INCLUDING THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND EFFICIENCY IN THEIR LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. AS YOU MAY KNOW STATE LAW AND REGULATIONS GIVE THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION DISTINCT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR A RANGE OF LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE RELATED TO THE CARD ROOM INDUSTRY. THE BUREAU IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PERFORMING BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS OF APPLICANTS SEEKING LICENSES THATWILL ENABLE THEM TO OWN OR WORK IN CARD ROOMS AND FOREIGN FORCING GAMING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BODY THAT MAKES LICENSING DECISIONS IN CONSIDERATION. OF THE BUREAU'S RECOMMENDATION AND WHEN APPLICABLE. TAKES OR UPHOLDS DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINST LICENSEES. THOSE WHO OWN OPERATE IN WORKING CARD ROOMS AND RELATED BUSINESSES PAY LICENSING AND REGULATORY FEES WHICH ARE DEPOSITED INTO THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUND TO COVER THE COST OF THOSE REGULATORY. ACTIVITIES IN THE AUDIT REPORT THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THE FOLLOWING. ONE BOTH THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION HAVE REPEATEDLY FAILED TO MEET CERTAIN REQUIRED TIME FRAMES FOR LICENSING ACTIVITIES AND HAVE COMPOUNDED SIGNIFICANT BACKLOGS IN THE LICENSING PROCESS TO BOTH THE BUREAU OF THE COMMISSION CHARGE FEES THAT DO NOT ALIGN WITH THE ACTUAL COSTS THEY INCUR. IN PERFORMING OVER OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES AND AS A RESULT THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUNDS BALANCE IS EXCESSIVE AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO KNOWN TO MORE THAN NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THE BUREAU THREE THE BUREAUS AND THE COMMISSION'S REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES THAT RESULTED AND THE UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF APPLICANTS. FOR THIS HEARING I LOOK FORWARD TO A PRODUCTIVE AND ROBUST DISCUSSION REGARDING THE ON A REPORTER WITH THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION ARE DOING TO IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONS AND ACCOMPLISH THEIR MISSIONS. WITH THAT I'LL TURN OVER THE MIKE TO OUR SENATE. GEO COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN A SENATOR DR THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN SALAS I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU ADD CENTER GRAY FOR. IN YOUR STAFF'S REPORTING WORK TOGETHER FOR TODAY'S HEARING. AND THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS TO AGREE TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. AS THE OTHER REVEALED THEIR BEEN INEFFICIENCIES WITH BOTH THE BUREAU OF GAME WE CONTROLLED. THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION. I PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT DESPITE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM THE LEGISLATURE. THE AUDIT FOUND THAT THE BUREAU HAD FAILED TO CLEAR ITS BACKLOG OF PENDING LICENSE APPLICATIONS. SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE AUDIT I'VE MET WITH THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION YEAH I AM CONFIDENT THAT IMPROVEMENTS CAN IT WILL BE MADE TO BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE HEARING TODAY TO DETERMINE WHAT STEPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN AND WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE TO COULD ADDRESS THESE INEFFICIENCIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SATURDAY OUT OF THE CEREMONY ASK IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER OPENING COMMENTS THIS TIME FOR MANY MEMBER ON THE DÃ­AS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON PLEASE. THANK YOU I. I JUST WANNA LAY OUT AN AREA WHERE I AM I WANT TO LOOK AT. HAVE SOME SOME QUESTIONS AND SOME HAD SOME COMMENTS HERE NUMBER ONE. I THINK WE HAVE SOME OF. VERY SPECIFIC RESULTS OUT OF THIS AUDIT NUMBER ONE WE HAVE DELAYS. WE HAVE INCONSISTENCIES WE HAVE BACKLOGS AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS LEADS TO THE APPEARANCE OF AN UNFAIR TREATMENT I THINK THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS. AREA HERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THESE APPLICANTS HAVE THE EXPECTATION OF DUE PROCESS. AND I'M NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR BUT THERE ARE I THINK SOME SERIOUS. ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO DUE PROCESS. ONE IS A PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS WHICH IS YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEFORE YOU KNOW THESE THESE BUREAUCRACIES AND MAKE AND MAKE YOUR APPLICATION. BUT THEN THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER YOU GET ACTUAL DUE PROCESS. AN ACTUAL DUE PROCESS IS GETTING TO A DECISION. THAT IS FAIRLY REACHED AND IS CONSISTENT AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE PRESENTING HERE WILL BE PREPARED TO ANSWER SOME OF MY QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO DUE PROCESS. WHETHER IT THEY ARE PROVIDING ACTUAL DUE PROCESS OR WHETHER THEY ARE MERELY PURSE PUT UP PROVIDING A PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS. IF YOU IF YOU'RE NOT. ACTUALLY GETTING TO DECISIONS IN A TIMELY FASHION AND IF YOU AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO. MAKE DECISIONS THAT APPEAR TO BE UNFAIR. YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT GETTING A DUE PROCESS I THINK THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT AREA THAT WE HAVE TO INQUIRE ABOUT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ASKING SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND I'M ASKING THOSE WHO PRESENT TO BE PREPARED TO ANSWER SOME OF MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBERS AND WE'RE GONNA GET OPENING COMMENTS FROM OUR ASSEMBLY GEO COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SALAS. CHAIRMAN DIED FOR. CONVENING THIS IMPORTANT TIMELY OVERSIGHT HEARING. OF THE BUREAU DOWN CONTROL IN THE CALIFORNIA. GIVE THE COMMISSION. AS WELL WHERE THERE WAS A STATE OUT REPORT. LEAST EARLY THIS YEAR THAT HIGHLIGHTED NUMBER OF CONCERNING ISSUES. AS IT RELATES TO DELAYS IN PROCESS. AND BUDGETARY ISSUES. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TESTIMONY TODAY I THINK THIS IS AN AREA MEMBERS WHERE. WE NEED TO ENGAGE PROBABLY IN OUR BUDGET PROCESS THIS NEXT YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE PROPER OVERSIGHT AND CERTAINLY. HAVING A POLICY OVERSIGHT HEARING TODAY I THINK SUPPORT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND THE SENATE FOR THE PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOU SOMEONE NUMBER GRAY WILL MOVE TO CENTER MORE LIKE FOR BRIEF OPENING COMMENTS THAT WE CAN GET STARTED ON PANELS AND I BELIEVE. POSSIBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS OF THE AUDIT. BASED TERMINAL SALAS AND THANK YOU FOR A. ALLOWING US TO ENJOY THESE MEETINGS I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE FROM A- LOOK AT BAKER SCHEME OF THINGS HOW DO WE HELP THESE DEPARTMENTS IN THE CITY JUST YOU KNOW ZOOMING IN ON. OVER FINING BECAUSE THE STATE AUDITOR'S FINDING SOMETHING EVERYWHERE SHE GOES AND SO IN ORANGE COUNTY SINCE WE- WENT THROUGH A CHAPTER NINE BANKRUPTCY WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE GET MORE EFFICIENT WE- IMPLEMENTED WHAT WAS CALLED RESULTS ORIENTED GOVERNMENT. IN EVERY DEPARTMENT HAD TO DO A BUSINESS PLAN IT HAD TO DETERMINE WHAT IS IT DO. HOW DOES IT MEASURE IT. AND HOW DOES IT COMPARE FROM PRIOR YEARS HOW DO YOU PLAN ON IMPROVING. AND SO IT WAS DR MANY WE EVEN HAD A TEN YEAR. FINANCIAL UP BUDGET THAT WOULD FILL INTO THAN COUNTIES OVERALL TO IN YOUR BUDGET. I COME FROM. A CPA BACKGROUND SO WE KEPT TIME AND BILLING. INFORMATION AND SO I'M JUST YOU KNOW WITH YOU KNOW HOW MUCH. TIME IT TAKES FOR A TASK THEN YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU NEED TO HIRE TO GET THOSE TASKS DONE. AND YOU CAN BUDGET ACCORDINGLY AND I'M- I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. MAYBE FROM A HIGHER LEVEL HOW DO WE HELP DEPARTMENTS. TO SAY HEY WE NEED MORE STAFF IN THIS IS WHAT THEY DO AND THIS IS HOW THEY DO IT IN THE STYLE IT'S BEEN GOING YEAR BY YEAR BY YEAR. THIS IS HOW WE'RE ACCOMPLISHING OUR GOALS. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS WHEN HE SHOWS US THAT SO MUCH IS TO BE DONE AND I BUT WHERE ARE WE GONNA PUT IT ACROSS THE WHOLE. SCHEME SO THAT THEY TAXPAYERS CAN HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE ABSOLUTELY IN OUR BUREAUCRACIES YEAH NO THANK SENATOR WERE LIKE I THINK THAT'S A POINT OF TODAY'S HEARING IS HOW DO WE GET AT THOSE EFFICIENCIES. THE AUDITOR WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND HOW WE GET AT SOME OF THAT BACKLOG ALSO BE HEARING FROM THE BUREAU ITSELF. ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO TACKLE I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE CHICKEN PERIOD THAT THEY NEED TO DO. LAUGHTER NOT IT IS COMPLETED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO COMPLETING THOSE AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY'S TESTIMONY TO SEE HOW THEIR- TACKLING THAT ISSUE AS WELL. SO THANK YOU. FOR COMMENTS WITHOUT WILL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOX AND THEN WE WILL BEGIN. AND THE COMMISSION LIKE LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT DAVID CHIU AND NINE WOULD TROUBLE TO HEAR SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT MAY BE GOING ON WITH THE BUREAU IN THE COMMISSION SO WE REQUESTED AN AUDIT TO HELP FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING IN TO SEE IF WE COULD CHARTER A PATH FORWARD TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES. THAT WERE SUBSTANTIATED IN. WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT OPERATION EFFICIENCY M. FAIR TREATMENT OF APPLICANTS OF APPROPRIATE. USE OF FUNDS TO TIMELINESS AND IN PROCEDURES CONSISTENT APPLICATIONS OF STANDARDS AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO APPRECIATE THE- STATE AUDITOR'S. REPORT WHICH GIVES US A ROADMAP FOR HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD IN A CONSTRUCTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE WAY. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I MET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SINCE THOUGHT IT HAS COME OUT. AND I JUST WANNA THANK THEM FOR EMBRACING THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS. AND FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH US TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AS- QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO AND TO MOVE FORWARD IN A POSITIVE WAY. TOGETHER SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND- TO ADDRESS SOME ISSUES WHICH I THINK BETTER WILL BE BETTER FOR ALL OF US HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RIGHT THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER WAS GOING CALL UP OUR PANEL THIS IS A CHEN ITEM NUMBER TWO OVERVIEW OF THE AUDIT. HAVE WITH US. MISS ELAINE HOW STATE AUDITOR WITH KILL FOR STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TAMMY LOZANO PRINCIPLE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. AND MORE. WRITTEN RT. A SENIOR HONORED WITH CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. MISS HOW WHEN YOU ARE READY PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SALAS CHAIRS GRAY AND DODD FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOWELL TO MY LEFT IS TAMMY LOZANO MS LOZANO WAS THE AUDIT MANAGER ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. TO MY RIGHT IS MARK REINER DE MISTER REINER D. WAS THE ACTUAL. TEAM LEADER WORKING WITH THE AUDIT STAFF AT BOTH THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROLLING GAMBLING THE COMMISSION. I'M GOING TO GO OVER THE ISSUES AND AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL AND THEN HANDED OFF TO STAFF AND THEY WILL DRILL DOWN IN EACH OF THE ISSUES THAT I HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU. WE DO HAVE A HANDOUT THAT I BELIEVE THE SERGEANTS HAVE DISTRIBUTED. WHEN MY COLLEAGUES. START DISCUSSING THE PARTICULAR ISSUES THEY WILL STEP YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE GRAPHICS THESE ARE EXCERPTS FROM THE AUDIT REPORT THAT REALLY DEMONSTRATE THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN A VARIETY OF AREAS. SO THE FIRST AREA THAT A MISSILE IS ON I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT. REALLY FOCUSES ON FUNDING FEES BILLING PRACTICES SO WE HAVE. THREE OR FOUR KEY ISSUES IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA THIS UMBRELLA OF FUNDING AND BILLING. ONE IS THAT THE FEES THAT THE BUREAU CHARGES DOES NOT REALLY ALIGNED WITH THE COSTS. SO SOME AT SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING OVER CHARGED WHILE OTHERS ARE BEING UNDER CHARGED FOR THE SERVICES THAT THE BUREAU PROVIDES AND SHE'LL GET INTO SPECIFICS WITH RESPECT TO THAT. THERE IS A MISALIGNMENT WITH. THE COSTS FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND WHAT FEES. INDIVIDUALS ARE PAYING. ALSO IT AS A CHAIRMAN MENTIONED ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE HAVE IN THE AUDIT REPORT IS THE FUND BALANCE FOR THE GAMBLING COMMISSION ARE. INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND THERE IS A GRAPHIC I IN THE HANDOUTS THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT. THE JUDGE THE FUND BALANCE HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN ADDITION THERE WILL BE A REPAYMENT OR IT. MAY HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED A REPAYMENT TOM FROM A LOAN. FROM THE GENERAL FUND THAT EVEN BUMPS THAT JET THAT FUND BALANCE UP EVEN MORE SO MORE THAN DOUBLE. IN FIVE YEARS BUT THEN THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT SO THEY HAVE A HUGE FUND BALANCE WHICH THEY COULD USE. TO HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE INEFFICIENCIES AND STAFFING ISSUES IT CETERA. BILLING PRACTICES. NOW THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE WE SAW INCONSISTENCIES IN THEIR BILLING PRACTICES AND BILLING INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FOR A LICENSE. MS LOZANO AGAIN WE'LL GET INTO SPECIFIC SPECIFICS WITH REESE RESPECT TO THAT. ANOTHER ISSUE RELATED TO COST IS SOMETHING CENTER MORE LOCK YOU JUST MENTIONED SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE SPENDING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME ON NON CASE HOURS THEY ARE NOT SPENDING THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME. REVIEWING APPLICATIONS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE TIME SHEETS AND THE TIME REPORTING WE'RE SEEING NON BILLABLE HOURS AND ACTUALLY NINE CASE HOURS. SO WE REALLY ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THAT YOUR STAFF FOR NOT SPENDING. MOST OF THEIR TIME DOING A JOB THE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING WHICH IS REVIEWING APPLICATIONS. SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR KEY ISSUES UNDER FUNDING AND BILLING ISSUES. WHEN MR REINER HE SPEAKS HE'S GOING TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF AREAS ONE IS RELATED TO LICENSING APPLICATIONS. THERE'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME FOR WHICH THE BUREAU IS SUPPOSED TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS. IN MOST INSTANCES THEY ARE EXCEEDING THAT STATUTORY TIME FRAME AND NOT GETTING THOSE APPLICATIONS REVIEWED. OUR AS PROMPTLY AS THEY SHOULD. IN LOOKING AT STAFFING INCREASES THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN. THE BUREAU. INCREASES IN LICENSING STAFF ON SEPARATE OCCASIONS AND ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE THE STAFF BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PRODUCTIVITY UNFORTUNATELY THE PRODUCTIVITY DIDN'T REFLECT THE INCREASE IN STAFFING SOME OF IT PERHAPS IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT SPENDING A LOT OF TIME. ON CASES THERE'S THEY HAVE BEEN A LOT OF NON BILLABLE HOURS NINE CASE HOURS SO WE WERE EXPECTING TO SEE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED THOSE TEMPORARY POSITIONS THAT HAVE ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED THEIR STAFF. THAT THERE WOULD BE AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY IN A REDUCTION IN THE IN THE BACKLOG. THERE HAS BEEN A REDUCTION IN THE BACKLOG BUT NOT TO THE POINT. WHERE IT SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF STAFFING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAS PROVIDED TO THE BUREAU. IN ADDITION WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE REGULATORY PROCESSES WITH RESPECT TO DENIALS OF APPLICATIONS. AND WE SAW SOME SOME WEAKNESSES IN THAT PROCESS THEY THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE. AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE REGULATIONS THE TIME FRAMES IN THE REGULATIONS ACTUALLY EXCEED. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY A TIME FRAME THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING THOSE THOSE DECISIONS MADE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE REGULATIONS THAT TAKE IT OUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DAYS. SO THERE'S A REAL DISCONNECTED THEY ARE WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY PROCESS APPLICATIONS AND THOSE THAT GO BEFORE THE COMMISSION. THE LAST AREA THE UMBRELLA AREAS REALLY WHAT SOME OF THE MEMBERS MENTIONED UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF APPLICANTS SO LICENSING APPLICANTS FROM CARD ROOMS. DIFFER FROM THOSE AS FAR AS THIRD PARTY APPLICANTS AND THEIR TREATMENT IS DIFFERENT AS FAR AS- A THIRD PARTY APPLICANTS CAN HAVE A TEMPORARY. A LICENSE AND THEY CAN KEEP THAT LICENSE UNTIL IT ACTUALLY DENIED. LICENSING APPLICANTS FOR CARD ROOMS. THEY LOSE THAT LICENSE AS SOON AS THERE'S THAT THERE'S A RECOMMENDATION. THAT THEY BE DENIED A LICENSE SO WE SAW SOME REAL INCONSISTENCIES IN AGAIN MISTER RANDY WILL STEP INTO A BIT MORE DETAIL WITH RESPECT TO THAT. SIMILARLY IN LOOKING AT BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE CONDUCTED WE SAW INCONSISTENCIES THERE AND WE TRIED TO REALLY DRILL DOWN AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY ARE THERE INCONSISTENCIES UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THEIR DOCUMENT RETENTION. I ASKED FOR MATERIALS TO SUPPORT SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS THE RETENTION POLICIES WERE NOT VERY GOOD SO WE WEREN'T ABLE TO SEE. SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WE WERE EXPECTING TO SEE THAT WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS SO WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THAT. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE ON UNDER THE UNEQUAL TREATMENT IS IF THERE ISN'T AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHERE THERE'S A RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMMISSION FOR THAT. THAT LICENSE APPLICATION TO BE DENIED THAT PERSON IS NOT REALLY GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. TO OPT OUT AND NOT HAVE THAT EVIDENTIARY HEARING HAPPEN. SOME FOLKS CAN OPT OUT BUT THE COMMISSION MOVES AHEAD AND HAS A HEARING AND THEN PUBLICLY DESCRIBES THE DECISION. AND IN SOME CASES THAT'S HARMFUL TO THOSE APPLICANTS WHERE THEY'VE DECIDED I DON'T WANT TO. CONTINUE IN THE PROCESS AND WE NEED TO STOP I'M OPTING OUT BUT THE COMMISSION GOES AHEAD AND MOVES FORWARD WITH THAT SO THOSE ARE THE THEY'RE VERY HIGH LEVEL ISSUES. THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT AS YOU SAID MR SALAS WE HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TO BOTH THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION. AND AGAIN AS STAFF STEP YOU THROUGH THE ISSUES THEY'LL THEY'LL TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUE WAS AND WHAT WE'VE RECOMMENDED SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO IS LOZANO AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU PLEASE MISSILES ON. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. AS THE STATE AUDITOR INDICATED I'M GOING TO COVER THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE REGULATORY DUTIES OF THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION IN TERMS OF THE FEE STRUCTURE CURRENTLY THERE'S TWO TYPES OF FEES ARE COLLECTED IN THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUN. LICENSING FEES THAT ARE PAID BY THE LICENSE APPLICANTS AS WELL AS BACKGROUND DEPOSITS FOR THE ACTUAL INVESTIGATION THAT THE BUREAU CONDUCTS THOSE THAT'S ONE AREA. UP FUNDING THAT GOES INTO THE GAMBLING CONTROL PLAN AND THE SECOND AREA IS WHAT WE REFER TO IN THE REPORT AS OTHER REGULATORY FEES AND THESE ARE THE AND FEES THAT ARE PAID BY THE CARD ROOM OWNERS. AND THE THIRD PARTY COMPANY OWNERS THE CARBON A CARD ROOM OWNERS PAY BASED ON THEIR NUMBER OF TABLES OR TOTAL REVENUE. AND THE THIRD PARTY COMPANY OWNERS PAY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND THE USER FEES ARE PAID ANNUALLY. SO THOSE TWO BUCKETS ARE KIND OF WHAT IS MAKING UP THE FUNDS ARE GOING INTO THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUN. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE REGULATORY FEES THAT ARE COLLECTED REASONABLY RELATE TO THE COST FOR THE ACTIVITIES THAT THOSE. FEES ARE SUPPORTING. AND WHAT WE SAW WAS OVER THE FIVE YEARS THAT IN TERMS OF THE LICENSING EXPENDITURES IN THE LICENSING REVENUE. THE REVENUE WASN'T COVERING THE COST OF THE EXPENDITURES I'M SORRY. WASN'T COVERING THE COST OF THE ACTIVITIES FOR THE LICENSING ACTIVITIES AND SPECIFICALLY IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. THE REVENUE THAT CAME IN WAS FOUR POINT TWO MILLION AND THE EXPENDITURES FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES WAS NINE POINT NINE MILLION WHICH IS A GAP OF FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE KIND OF SAW THE FLIP OF THAT FOR THE OTHER REGULATORY FEES WHERE WERE THE REVENUE THAT WAS BEING GENERATED FROM THOSE ANNUAL FEES PAID BY THE CARBON OWNERS AND THIRD PARTY COMPANY. OWNERS. FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE REVENUE WAS EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION WHILE THE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE. ACTIVITIES WAS SIX POINT NINE MILLION WHICH GENERATE IN EXCESS OF TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. INTO THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUN AND WHAT THIS LACK OF ALIGNMENT OF THE FEES MEANS IS THAT ESSENTIALLY THE OTHER REGULATORY FEES ARE SUBSIDIZING THE COST OF THE LICENSING ACTIVITIES. AND THIS IS PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU USE FEES THAT ARE COLLECTED FOR ONE PURPOSE TO SUBSIDIZE A GAP IN ANOTHER ACTIVITY THESE FEES. ARE ACTUALLY APPLE OPERATING MAYBE OPERATING AS A TAX. AND WHICH IS UNLAWFUL. ANOTHER THING THAT THE LACK OF ALIGNMENT IN THE FEES ALSO RESULTED IN THE EXCESSIVE FUND BALLOTS WITH JUST THE STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED AND IF YOU GO TO THE GRAPHICIN THE PACKET ON PAGE TWO IT SHOWS THE FIVE YEAR GROWTH GOING FROM FISCAL YEAR FOURTEEN AT THIRTEEN FOURTEEN IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND AT THE END OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT WAS UP TO SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN WE ALSO SHOW THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN GENERAL LOAN FUNDS BACK TO THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUND WHICH PROJECTS THAT THE FUND WILL EXCEED OUR BE UP TO NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. WHEN WE LOOKED AT. KIND OF THE REASONS WHY THE FUND WAS GROWING SO MUCH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NOTED WAS THERE'S BEEN NO RECENT ANALYSIS AN UPDATE OF THE FEES. THE COMMISSION DEVELOPS PUTS THE FEES AND REGULATIONS AND THEY HAVEN'T UPDATE THOSE FEES SENSE MOST OF THE FEES SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND SOME OTHER REGULATORY FEES BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FOUR IS THE LAST TIME THEY BEEN UPDATED THE BUREAU FOR ITS PART. THEY THEY ACTUALLY ESTABLISH THE BACKGROUND DEPOSIT FEES. AND THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN EVALUATED SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. SO WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION THAT THEY DO A THOROUGH COST ANALYSIS. OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN ALIGN THE FEES WHAT THE COST. SO THAT THE FEE PAYERS ARE BEING FAIRLY CHARGED. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR AFTER SOME OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE OR IMPLEMENTED IN TERMS OF. CLEANING UP THERE PROCESSES MISTER RANDY IS GOING TO TALK IN JUST A FEW MINUTES ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND DEFICIENCIES THE BE SIGNED THEIR PROCESSES AND THEY REALLY NEED TO DO THAT BEFORE THEY- KIND OF UPDATE THEIR FEES SO THAT THEY- ARE FAIR. WE ALSO MADE A LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION THAT WHEN THE COMMISSION AND THE BUREAU COMES BACK TO UPDATE THEIR FEES. THAT THEY REQUIRED THE COMMISSION AND THE BUREAU TO UPDATE THE REGULATIONS TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC PURPOSES. FOR THEIR APPROPRIATE USE OF THE FEES FOR EACH OF THOSE BUCKETS OF MONEY. ANOTHER AFFECT OF THE LARGE SURPLUS IN THE GAMBLING GAMBLING CONTROL FUND HAS BEEN THAT IS ALLOW THE BUREAU TO ENGAGE IN BILLING PRACTICES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT AND PENSION CHOI AND FAIR TO APPLICANTS. AND IF YOU REFER TO THE GRAPHIC ON PAGE THREE IN YOUR HAND OUT. WE SHOW THERE THE THREE BUCKETS OF TIME WE LOOKEDAT THE LICENSING STAFF AND HOW THEY WERE CHARGING THEIR TIME AND THERE'S REALLY THREE THREE BUCKETS THAT THEY CHARGE THEIR TIME TO. FIRST THE BILLABLE TIME IN THE NON BILLABLE TIME. OR ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR CASE REVIEWS. AND WHAT WHAT WE EXPECTED TO SEE WAS THE NON BILLABLE TIME WOULD BE A SMALL AMOUNT AND THE BILLABLE TIME WOULD BE MORE OF THEIR POLICIES REQUIRE THEM. TO SORT OF WORK TOWARDS CHARGING SIX HOURS A DAY TOWARDS THE BILLABLE TIME. AND WHAT WE SAW WAS AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ON THE GRAPHIC IT'S 12% AND THESE ARE THE OF THE FEES THAT GO AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF POSITS AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER THE COST OF THE INVESTIGATION THEY CAN GO BACK TO THE APPLICANT REQUESTS MORE MONEY. AND CONVERSELY IF THEY DON'T SPEND IT ALL THEY HAVE TO REFUND IT TO THE- APPLICANT. IN THE NON BILLABLE CATEGORY THOSE ARE FOR TIME SPENT WORKING ON APPLICANT BUT APPLICATION BUT NOT CHARGED THE APPLICANT IN THIS SHOULD BE FOR. CASES WHAT THEY EXPLAINED TO US THAT WOULD BE IN A SITUATION WHERE LET'S SAY THE FILE WAS. NOT LOOKED OUT FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEY GO BACK TO IT SO IT'S SORT OF. A LITTLE BIT INEFFICIENT NOT FAIR TO THE- TO CHARGE THE. THE APPLICANT AND SO THEY WOULD CHARGE NON BILLABLE SO WE EXPECTED TO SEE SMALL AMOUNTS. BUT WHEN WE DID OUR ANALYSIS WE LOOKED AT FORTY CASES. AND WE SAW THAT IN TWENTY EIGHT OF THOSE CASES AT LEAST 25% OF THE TIME CHARGE TO THE CASE WAS NON% BILLABLE. IN NINETEEN APPLICATIONS THE NON BILLABLE TIME EXCEEDED THE BILLABLE. NUMBER OF HOURS AND IN FIFTEEN OF THOSE APPLICATIONS 75% OF THE TOTAL OUT TOTAL HOURS BUILD WAS NON BILLABLE AND SO WE LOOKED AT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH NON BILLABLE TIME AND WHAT WE SAW WAS THE CATEGORIES THAT THEY- WERE USING FOR THE BILLABLE NON BILLABLE WERE PRIMARILY THE SAME ALMOST EVERY CATEGORY WAS THE SAME SO THERE WASN'T GOOD GUIDANCE ON WHEN TO CHARGE BILLABLE AND ONE TO NON START. TO NOT TO CHARGE NON BILLABLE AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED BY THE LARGE VOLUME OF NON BILLABLE TIME ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT. SOME OF THE APPLICANTS WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE FORTY CASES WERE BEING CHARGED THE FULL AMOUNT AND SOME WERE NOT AND SO THIS KIND OF CREATES A- DISPARITY AMONG THE LICENSE APPLICANTS AND A SENSE OF UNFAIRNESS. AND THEN THE LAST CATEGORIES THE NON CASE TIME WHICH IT REP REPRESENTING 48% OF THE A LICENSING STAFF TIME AND THAT WAS CONCERNING GIVEN THE HIGH NUMBER OF BACKLOG OF LICENSE APPLICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE COMPLETED. WHICH MISTER RIGHT AND HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT A FEW MINUTES WE DID MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BUREAU TO ESTABLISH POLICIES REQUIRING STAFF TO PROPERLY REPORT AND EQUITABLY BILL TIME. AND ALSO TO ESTABLISH CLEAR THRESHOLDS FOR PROPORTIONS OF TIME STAFF CHARGE TO THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES. THE BUREAU HAS ESTABLISHED A POLICIES FOR TIME REPORTING AND IDENTIFIED THRESHOLDS FOR THE PROPORTION OF TIME WE ARE WORKING WITH THE BUREAU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE THRESHOLD THAT IS IDENTIFIED IN EVALUATING WHETHER THE THRESHOLDS FULLY ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. AND OVER TO MARK. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIRS MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK RUNNING WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH OUR AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO SOME EFFICIENCY CONCERNS WE FOUND IN THE LICENSING REVIEW PROCESS IN ADDITIONALLY SOME SOME SHORTCOMINGS WE IDENTIFIED IN TERMS OF REGULATIONS AND INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO INCONSISTENT TREATMENT OF APPLICANTS AND CERTAINLY GIVEN THE DISCUSSION THAT THESE ENTITIES HAVE AND PROCESSING AND DECIDING UPON LICENSE APPLICATIONS IN THIS INDUSTRY. PERCEPTIONS OF UNFAIR TREATMENT. AS THE STATE AUDITOR ALLUDED TO IN HER INITIAL REMARKS THE BUREAU GAMBLING CONTROL HAS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS GENERALLY SPEAKING TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION TO A BACKGROUND CHECK. AND FORWARD THAT APPLICATION ON TO THE GAMBLING COMMISSION WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE GAMING COMMISSION EITHER APPROVE OR DENY THAT APPLICATION. FOR A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND I'LL BE ALLUDING TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF LICENSE APPLICATIONS AS WE GO THROUGH WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CARTER AND BUSINESSES IN THE THIRD PARTIES THAT WORK IN THOSE CARTOONS. BUT IT IN EACH GROUP THERE ARE ALSO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT HAVE IMPLICATIONS AND REGULATIONS IN POLICY FOR HOW THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED AN TREATED. GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE'S A LOWEST STAFF LEVEL OF LICENSE HOLDER LICENSE HOLDER AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL THAT IS GENERALLY A SUPERVISOR FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM AND THEN. THE HIGHEST LEVEL BEING THE LICENCES HELD BY ACTUAL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEIR DIFFERENT RULES IN CONSIDERATION FOR EACH OF THOSE I'LL GET INTO. WHEN WE- REVIEWED THE BUREAU GAMING AT ALL THE DATA WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMELINESS OF ITS PROCESSING OF BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS FOR LICENSE APPLICANTS. WE FOUND THAT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES IT WAS EXCEEDING THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME AND IN SOME CASES BY. A REALLY SIGNIFICANT MARGIN IF YOU WOULD. PLEASE TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE HAVE A TABLE THAT WE DEVELOPED BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THAT DATA. GOING BACK THE LAST FIVE YEARS AT THE TIME OF OUR REVIEW. AND THERE'S A LOT OF NUMBERS THERE SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT THE TAKE AWAY IS KIND OF TWO FOLD. FIRST IS THAT THE RED SUBTOTAL LINE AT THE BOTTOM THERE SHOWS THAT OUT OF THE FIVE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS THAT A COMPLETED DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THIS TIME REQUIREMENTS. THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED ABOUT 70% EXCEEDED THE STATUTORY TIME FRAME FOR PROCESSING THEM. THE SECOND THING THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU IS THAT THERE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF APPLICATIONS THAT TOOK MULTIPLE YEARS FOR THE BUREAU TO PROCESS. AND MOVE ALONG TO THE GAMBLING COMMISSION FOR ACTUAL AT. ACTION ON THOSE LICENSES. AND THAT HAS A COUPLE OF IMPLICATIONS DEPENDING ON THE LICENSE TYPE. AS A GENERAL RULE APPLICANTS ARE ALLOWED TO WORK UNDER TEMPORARY STATUS WHILE THEIR APPLICATION IS PENDING AND THAT'S USUALLY. A SET TIME FRAME THAT'S CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN SOME OF THESE WAIT PERIOD BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO KIND OF PERPETUALLY RENEW THOSE TEMPORARY LICENSES UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A DECISION IS MADE. SO IT BY AND LARGE APPLICANTS ARE ABLE TO GO OUT TO WORK ON THAT'S A BENEFIT TO THEM FINANCIALLY DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME WITH THE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS. HOWEVER OBVIOUSLY A HUGE PART PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE PROPERLY VETTED AND THAT THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR WORK IN THE INDUSTRY SO LONG WAITS WHERE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY REVIEWED ARE ACTIVE WE WERE PARTICIPATING IN SHE DOES. CREATE A RISK TO THE PUBLIC AND TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS EMPLOY THEM. THE OTHER THING I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO CARDROOM OWNERS IN PARTICULAR. TEMPORARY LICENSES ARE NOT. REALLY A FAN SO THE TEMP CARBON LÃ  CARDROOM OWNER APPLICANTS ARE USUALLY. HAVE APPLICATIONS ARE ASSOCIATE WITH AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A CHOIR TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF A BUSINESS THOSE LICENSES CANNOT BE ACTED UPON ON A TEMPORARY BASIS OF THOSE CONTRACTS IN THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE TO GENERALLY WAIT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS- THE BUREAU HAS FINISHED ITS WORK ON THE COMMISSION IS MADE A DECISION SO. THERE'S A REAL RISK TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS BUSINESS INTERESTS FROM THESE DELAYS AND I WE'LL GET IN TO SOME SPECIFIC REVIEW OF THOSE OF THOSE OF THOSE TIME FRAMES SHORTLY. IN TERMS OF WHY. WE YOU KNOW SOME OF ITS THEN THE CAUSES WE SAW FOR SOME OF THESE DELAYS. WHEN A WHEN A LICENSE APPLICATION COMES INTO THE BUREAU AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT YOU WENT TO A AN INTAKE UNIT. AS IS POSSIBLE FOR COLLECTING ALL OF THESE. APPLICATIONS AND ASSOCIATED BACKGROUND MATERIALS PROVIDED BY APPLICANTS. AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT THAT IN TAKING IT DID NOT HAVE ANY FUNCTION FOR ASSESSING THE COMPLETENESS OF THE INFORMATION IN THOSE. IN THOSE APPLICATION PACKAGES THEY WOULD FINALLY JUST TAKE IT. COLLATED POTENTIALLY STANCE ON THE DOCUMENTATIONS FOR ANIL AND HOUSES AT A LATER DATE AND THEN SHELVE IT PENDING ONE OF THE LICENSING UNITS. PICKING IT UP AND ASSIGNING IT TO STAFF FOR REVIEW. TWO THINGS KIND OF CAME INTO PLAY THERE. ONE THEY WERE NOT SET BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ASSESSING THE COMPLETENESS. THEY WERE NOT GETTING BACK TO APPLICANTS IN A TIMELY FASHION AS REQUIRED BY REGULATIONS IN TERMS OF WHETHER THOSE APPLICATIONS WERE COMPLETE OR NOT. SO IN SOME CASES APPLICANTS FOR WAITING MONTHS EVEN YEARS TO HEAR BACK FROM WHETHER THEY'VE EVEN SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION MATERIALS THAT WERE REQUIRED OF THEM. SECONDLY BECAUSE IT TOOK SO LONG TO ULTIMATELY ASSIGN SOME OF THOSE APPLICATIONS TO WAITING ANALYST'S ANALYTICAL STAFF. WE FOUND INSTANCES WHERE THE MATERIALS THAT THE APPLICANTS HAVE PROVIDED UP FRONT HAD KIND OF AGE OUT OR WERE STILL FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUREAU AND SO THEY HAD IN BOTH OF THOSE CASES THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO APPLICANTS. AFTER SIGNIFICANT PERIODS OF TIME AND REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION A FOLLOW UP QUESTION SO THEY REALLY CONTRIBUTED TO INEFFICIENCIES AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT FRUSTRATION ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANTS ABOUT THE ENSUING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN. THE BUREAU STAFF AND THE APPLICANT IN TERMS OF REPEATED REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AT TIMES WE SAW REQUESTS FROM THE BUREAU FOR FOLLOW UP INFORMATION THAT WERE YOU KNOW UP TO A YEAR APART SO THAT. IS REPEATED BACK AND FORTH AND REALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE LICENSES WERE ACTIVELY BEING WORKED ON FOR MULTIPLE YEARS. HOW ALSO NOTE THAT. THIS THE LACK OF NOTICED APPLICANTS IS A IS HAVE A COMMON THEME THAT WE IDENTIFIED AS WELL. IN ADDITION TO HAVING TO NOTIFY APPLICANTS ABOUT THE INITIAL STATUS OF THEIR APPLICATION IN REGULATIONS. THE GAMMA CONTROL ACT REQUIRES THAT THE BUREAU. FOLLOW UP WITH APPLICANTS AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME IF THEY ARE NOT YET FINISHED WITH THE APPLICATION TO. PROVIDE AN ESTIMATED TIME OF COMPLETION. WE SAW THAT HAPPENING IN NONE OF THE CASES THAT WE REVIEWED. INDEED WE SAW IT AND AT LEAST ONE INSTANCE IN WHICH AN- AN APPLICANT. A RICK REQUESTED REPEATEDLY FROM THE BUREAU. AND THAT THAT DAY AS REQUIRED BY LAW AND WE SAW NO EVIDENCE THAT THE BUREAU ACTUALLY EVER PROVIDE ANY SERVICE IN A TIME FRAME IN TERMS OF THE INTERACTIONS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THOSE. INDIVIDUALS. I MENTIONED THE OWNER THE OWNER APPLICANTS HAVE TO GENERALLY WAIT UNTIL THEIR THEIR LICENSE HAS GONE THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS. CAN ACT ON SOME OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS. AS SUCH WE- PA VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE POLICY FOR PRIORITIZING THOSE APPLICATIONS OR LACK THERE OF AS IT TURNS OUT. AT THE AT THE BUREAU. WHEN WE LOOKED AT A SELECTION OF OUR APPLICATIONS WE FOUND OUT WE FIND THAT ALTHOUGH WE WOULD EXPECT APPLICATIONS TO BE PROCESSED IN THE ORDER THEY WERE RECEIVED. THAT WAS INFREQUENT THAT WAS FREQUENTLY NOT THE CASE. I AND IN FACT APPLICATIONS THAT CAME IN THE DOOR. WITHIN THE SAME MONTH OR SOMETIMES A SIGNED OUT ALMOST A YEAR APART OR MORE SO. WE ASKED TO THE WE ASK THE BUREAU WHAT IT'S RATIONALE WAS FOR THAT AND A CASE BY CASE BASIS THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE EXPLANATIONS ABOUT WHY AN APPLICATION. KIND OF GOT MOVED TO THE FRONT OF THE PACK. SUCH EXAMPLES THEY PROVIDED WHERE THAT A FAN OF. A LICENSE HOLDER A FAMILY MEMBER WAS ILL AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LICENSE WAS PROCESS BEFORE PERHAPS SOMEONE HE- WAS DECEASED OR- LEGAL ACTION IS BEING TAKEN AND THEY DIDN'T WANT AN APPLICATION TO EXPIRE. AND SO WHILE THOSE. THOSE UP EXPLANATIONS CAM IN A VACUUM. MADE SOME SENSE THERE WAS NO INDICATION ABOUT WHAT HOW THOSE HOW THOSE. DETERMINATIONS CONSIDERED EVERYBODY ELSE THAT WAS WAS CUED UP WAITING. WE ALSO GOT SOME CONFLICTING IN. FEEDBACK FROM SOME OF THE BUREAU MANAGERS ABOUT. SOME ATTRIBUTED A LACK OF STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AT THIS AT SIMULTANEOUS TO OTHER OTHER MANAGER SAYING THEY WERE ABLE TO ASSIGN DURING THAT SAME TIME HERE BECAUSE THEY HAD SUFFICIENT STAFF SO ALL THOSE GAVE US SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE FAIRNESS AND EQUITY AND CERTAINLY THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE PROCESS THAT THE DOOR HAD IN PLACE FOR PRIORITIZING AND GETTING THROUGH THOSE LEGAL REVIEWS I WILL NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS A SEPARATE LEGAL DIVISION THE INDIAN AND GAINING LAW SECTION. THAT AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTUALLY PROCESSING THE LEGAL PAPERWORK ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE OWNER APPLICATIONS AND WE FOUND ADDITIONAL PROCEDURAL ISSUES WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP IN SO FAR AS WHEN WE SPOKE TO THE AYE GLS DIRECTOR THEY INDICATED TO US THAT THEY THAT THAT THE THAT I GLS WAS BASICALLY ARE RESPONSIVE AND DEPENDED UPON THE BUREAU TO TELL THEM WHAT THE PRIORITIES WERE TO SET TIME FRAMES FOR THEM TO FOLLOW BUT WE THOUGHT WE SAW VERY KIND OF INFREQUENT IN ONLY INFORMAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BUREAU AND AYE GLS ABOUT THOSE TIME FRAMES SO THERE WASN'T A LOT OF IMPETUS. OUR OWN IS BEING PUT ON AYE GLS FROM THE BUREAU SIDE SO WE DID MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS AREA THAT THE BUREAU ESTABLISH A PROTOCOL FOR FORMALIZING A FIRST IN FIRST OUT PROCESS FOR ON APPLICATIONS AND DELINEATING AND THAT POLICY WHERE EXCEPTIONS WOULD THERE WOULD BE EXCEPTIONS THAT FIRST IN FIRST OUT I UNABLE TO TELL YOU. THAT BASED ON OUR SIXTY DAY CHECK IN WITH WITH THE BUREAU THEY HAVE A STAT STEP POLICY THAT POLICY LISTS THE TYPES OF EXCEPTIONS I. DO IN TERMS OF HEALTH OF THE APPLICANT AS AN EXAMPLE AS POTENTIAL EXCEPTIONS TO FIRST IN FIRST OUT POLICY. NOW WE ALSO KNOW. THAT IT IT HAS A STEP. SOMETHING ABOUT CATCH. THE EXCEPTION THAT IF THE IF THE LICENSING DIRECTOR DETERMINES THAT THERE ARE OTHER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD WARRANT IT THEY CAN TAKE AN APPLICATION ON ORDER SO OUR IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE TO THE- DID YOUR AND WE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. WE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE THAT IF THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT APPROACH AT THAT POLICY THEY NEED TO BE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS I CONNECTING Y. DECISION WAS MADE BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY LARGE. DISCRETION IF THEY RETAIN THAT POLICY TO TAKE APPLICATIONS OUT OF ORDER. WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSESSING THE COMPLETENESS OF APPLICATIONS WHEN THEY COME IN THE DOOR. THE BUREAU HAS ESTABLISHED POLICIES THAT NOW MAKE THE INTAKE UNIT RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THAT. HAS SET I BELIEVE IT'S FIVE DAY TIME FRAMES FOR THEM TO DO THAT TURN AROUND AND INFORM THE APPLICANT. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE BUREAU HAS PROVIDED US. HOW WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT WILL HELP THEM LIMIT SOME OF THE INEFFICIENT BACK AND FORTH THAT RESULTED FROM. FROM INCOMPLETE AND DATED INFORMATION. THAT SAID AS ALL GET INTO NEXT THERE ARE OTHER OPERATIONAL ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED WITH THE EFFICIENCY AT THE BUREAU THAT STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO ENSURE THAT THE BACKLOG PRUDENT THEIR- THEIR- STATUTORY FOR TIME FRAMES ARE MATT. SO WITH THAT I WILL ASK YOU TO TURN TO THE FINAL PAGE PAGE FIVE. THE TOP PART OF THIS GRAPHIC CONSIST CONCERNS IT'S BASICALLY INCOMING AND OUTGOING APPLICATIONS BOTH NEW AND RENEWALS INSTRUCTIONS AND RENEWALS AND THEN BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO FOCUS ON IS GUESTS TO THINGS ONE IS THAT OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME IN THE NUMBER OF INCOMING APPLICATIONS DID INCREASE BUT IT DID SO FAIRLY MODESTLY I WAS BUT A 5% OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME. SO THAT'S THAT'S A FACTOR BUT IT'S NOT A DRIVING FACTOR IN TERMS OF THE BEER IS AN ABILITY TO CLEAR ITS BACK WHILE COMPLETELY THAT BACKLOG IS REPRESENTED BY THE GREEN BARS IN EACH IN EACH ITEM AND YOU CAN SEE AS OF TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THERE ALMOST TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED BACKLOG APPLICATIONS DOWN TO EIGHTEEN HUNDRED IN THE END OF TEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN I WHICH IS THE MOST RECENT DATA THAT WE WERE USING DURING OUR AUDIT. AS THE STATE AUDITOR EXPLAINED THAT A REDUCTION IN ABSOLUTE TERMS IN THE NUMBER OF BACKLOGGED APPLICATIONS HOWEVER% DOES NOT COMMENSURATE THE INVESTMENT THAT YOU AS A LEGISLATURE NAY IN ADDITIONAL STAFFING FOR THE BUREAU SINCE JULY TWENTY FIFTEEN THE BUREAU HAS RECEIVED ON THE TEMPORARILY FUNDED BASIS THIRTY TWO ADDITIONAL ANALYST POSITIONS LICENSING DIVISION THAT HAVE MORE THAN. DOUBLED TO THAT FILM LICENSING BECAUSE OF THIS PERIOD OF TIME. THAT DATA IS PRESENTED BY THE VERY BOTTOM LINE I THINK AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. AT TWENTY FIVE FILLED LICENSE POSITIONS AS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN UP TO FIFTY NINE. IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SO AS YOU CAN SEE MORE THAN A MORE THAN 1100% INCREASE. IN ANALYZING WHY OR OR HOW THAT IMPACTED THE EFFICIENCY IN THE PARK IF ANY OF THE LICENSING ACTIVITIES AT THE BUREAU WE TOOK A LOOK AT ON AVERAGE THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT. THE GIVEN STAFF MEMBER FILLED STAFF POSITION WAS ABLE TO PROCESS IN A GIVEN YEAR. AND WHAT DISTURBED US ABOUT THAT ANNOUNCES WHAT IT SHOWED THAT. THAT HAS BEEN A STEEP DECLINE SINCE THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AS THE GRAPHIC SHOWS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ALTHOUGH THEY HAD ONLY TWENTY FIVE FILL LICENSING POSITIONS EACH OF THOSE POSITIONS WAS ABLE TO PROCESS ON AVERAGE A HUNDRED FORTY SIX. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS SINCE AND SEND THOSE ON. BY CONTRAST BY THE TIME THEY GOT WE GET TO NINE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. THERE WERE FIFTY NINE LICENSING STOP EACH OF PROCESSING LESS THAN HALF OF THE PRODUCTIVITY AT THE BEGINNING THAT TIME PERIOD ONLY SEVENTY APPLICATIONS ON AVERAGE. SO THIS SET OFF OBVIOUS THE ALARM BELLS FOR US WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT ACCOUNTED FOR THIS THIS DECREASE IN IN PRODUCTIVITY AND HOW COULD BE ADDRESSED. UNFORTUNATELY THAT THE EXPLANATION SHE GOT IN THE DATA THAT THE BUREAU HAS MAKE IT CHALLENGING TO ASSESS WHAT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF STAFFING IS AT THE BUREAU GOING FORWARD. ONE REASON FOR THAT. IS THAT THE BUREAU HAS INFORMATION ON HOW LONG IT TAKES. ON AVERAGE TO PROCESS THESE APPLICATIONS BUT IT HASN'T UPDATED THE MAJORITY. OF THAT INFORMATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUALLY PRIOR TO THE TIME WHEN ADDED THESE POSITIONS SO IF THERE'S ANY SORT OF. DIMINISHING RETURNS ON ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WERE CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT THERE ARE THAT WOULD BE KIND OF FOR THAT FLIGHT DATA. IN FACT FOR THE POSITIONS THAT ARE THE TYPES OF LICENSES THAT HAS UPDATED THAT DATA. THAT SHOW THAT THERE BEEN SIGNIFICANT CREATE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES THE NUMBER OF HOURS IT TAKES PER WHICH CERTAINLY GIANTS WITH WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE DID OUR OWN. ANALYSIS. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE BUREAU DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL PROTOCOL FOR WHICH PORTIONS OF ITS BACKLOG IS GOING TO TARGET AT WHAT TIMES AND IN WHAT NUMBERS INSTEAD WHEN WE ASKED MANAGEMENT AT THE BUREAU ABOUT THIS TREND THEY ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT WELL BE FOCUSING THEIR ATTENTION ON DIFFERENT TYPES ARE DIFFERENT COMPOSITIONS OF APPLICATIONS YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT SOME OF WHICH ARE MORE COMPLEX THAN OTHERS AND THAT MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGES IN PRODUCTIVITY HOWEVER WE LOOK AT THE DATA IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL NUMBERS COMING OUT OF IT DIDN'T DIDN'T CONSISTENTLY BEAR OUT THAT THESIS. FOR EXAMPLE THE BUREAU STRESSED TO US THAT IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THEY TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE MORE TIME CONSUMING AND COMPLEX THIRD PARTY OWNER APPLICATIONS. AND THAT THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE DECREASE IN SOME OTHER OTHER PRODUKTIVNOSTI. ANY THIRD PARTY OR APPLICATIONS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SIMILARLY WE SOUTH FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CARBON APPLICATIONS THAT WERE NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE THAT SO THAT THE COMPLEXITY OF THOSE AND ULTIMATELY A MANAGER FOR THAT UNIT TOLD US THAT SHE COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHY THERE WAS THE FLUCTUATION THAT WE WERE SEEING SO WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE BUREAU DEVELOP A FORMAL POLICY OUR FIRM FORMAL PLANNED BY NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR FOR COMPLETING REMAINING BACKLOG APPLICATION TO EXPECT THAT PLAN TO BE VERY PRECISE ABOUT WHEN IT. WHEN IT EXPECTS TO CLEAR WHICH BACK WHICH BACKLOG APPLICATIONS WHEN TO GET TO THAT NUMBER OF ZERO AS PART OF THAT PROCESS WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION THE LEGISLATURE THAT IT EXTEND TEMPORARY CURRENT TEMPORARY FUNDING FOR THOSE POSITIONS FOR TWO YEARS RATHER THAN MAKE THEM PERMANENT BECAUSE AS AS HOPEFULLY HAVE MADE CLEAR WE IT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE BEER HAS ESTABLISH WHAT OF WHAT A PERMANENT APPROPRIATE STAFFING OF ALL IS FOR ALL THESE THE MANAGEMENT AND EFFICIENCY SHORTCOMINGS WITHIN A FIVE AND THE LEGISLATURE ACTED UPON THE RECOMMENDATION HAS EXTEND THAT FUNDING SO OUR HOPE IS THAT THE BUREAU WILL TAKE THE INTERVENING TIME CLEAR ITS BACKLOG DELIBERATELY AND THEN ESTABLISH. GOOD POLICY CAN AND PRODUCT. THAT WILL HELP IT. STRAIGHT TO YOU WHAT A PERMANENT STAFFING LEVEL WITH. THAT WHICH MEANT. AND DUE TO SOME CONCERNS ABOUT OUR- PAST INTERPRETATIONS OF LAW AND REGULATIONS TO BUREAU. SEVERAL YEARS AGO PUT A MORATORIUM ON UP I'M PROCESSING NEW GAMES APPLICATIONS AND WHAT THAT HAS CREATED AS A KIND OF A BIFURCATED SYSTEM WHERE CERTAIN CERTAIN KARDAM ESTABLISHMENTS ARE ABLE TO OFFER GAMES THAT OTHERS CANNOT. BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF THAT APPLICATION AND SO WE'VE BEEN. KIND OF YOU'RE DOING THE PROCESS OF OUR AUDIT IN SANSKRIT URGING THE VÃ  BUREAU TO TAKE ACTION TO DECIDE ON A COURSE OF ACTION FOR PROCESSING ALL THIS PAINTING GAMES APPLICATIONS. AS OF SIXTY DAYS THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO. SO WE WILL STILL BE A MONITORING THAT THAT FAIRNESS CONCERN THAT WE THAT WE DEVELOPED. TURNING TO THE COMMISSION IN TERMS OF THE TIME FRAMES IN THE TIMELINESS OF THEIR APP OF APPLICATION PROCESS. I'LL START OFF BY SAYING THAT AT THE TIME OF OUR REVIEW THE COMMISSION DID NOT MAINTAIN COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON ITS- WORKLOAD. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DO ANY SORT OF SIMILAR ANALYSIS THAT WE PERFORMED AT THE BUREAU. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY FINDINGS THAT AREA WE DID MAKE A RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY HAVE A BUSINESS NEED TO DO SO. AND AT SIXTY DAYS THEY DID DEMONSTRATE TO US THAT THEY HAVE PUT A POLICY IN PLACE TO. ENTER THAT INFORMATION AN EXISTING DATABASE. GOING FORWARD AND ALSO PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT DIRECTED STAFF GOING BACK AT LEAST SEVERAL YEARS IN ARREARS TO ENTER PASSED DATA SO OUR HOPE IS THAT. IF THAT CONTINUES IN THE SUCCESSFUL THERE WILL BE MORE ROBUST INFORMATION ON. THE OVERALL TIME LINES AND PRODUCTIVITY ASSOCIATE WITH THE COMMISSION'S ACTIVITIES. WHAT I CAN SAY WE DID REVIEW EIGHTEEN APPLICATIONS ON A CASE BY CASE DETAIL BASIS FOR THE TIME FRAME THAT THEY THEY TOOK IN GOING THROUGH THE COULD BE GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION. THERE IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY TIME FRAME FOR THE- COMMISSION TO APPROVE OR DENY AN APPLICATION WITH THAT COMES THROUGH FROM THE BUREAU WITH THE RECOMMENDATION ASSOCIATED WITH IT. WE FOUND THAT IN CASES WHERE THE COMMISSION APPROVED A LICENSE APPLICANT IT MEANT THAT TIME FROM VERY EASILY IN FACT THAT AN AVERAGE OF JUST TWO. LESS THAN UNDER UNDER THIRTY DAYS GENERALLY SPEAKING. HOWEVER IN INSTANCES WHERE THE BUREAU OCT OR THE EXCUSE ME THE COMMISSION ABSOLUTELY OPTED TO DENY RECOMMENDATION WE FOUND THAT MOST OF AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT DAYS TO RESOLVE. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE STATE ARE ALLUDED TO IS THE INCREASED USE OF EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS WHICH ARE CHOISISSEZ JUDICIAL. HEARINGS THAT THE- COMMISSION HOLDS ANYTIME THEY HAVE A BELIEVE IT THEY MAY DENY AN APPLICANT. THEY PUT INTO REGULATIONS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE A MANDATORY HEARING FOR ANY ANY APPLICANT THAT THEY DENIED. AND WE ASK THEM ABOUT WHY THEY DID THAT THEY REFERENCED TEXT IN THE GAMMA CONTROL ACT. THAT THEY BELIEVE REQUIRED THEM TO DO SO WE REVIEW THAT TAX THAT WE FOUND THAT THAT WE ACTUALLY WE AGREED WITH THEIR WITH THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THAT. HOWEVER WE NOTED THAT THE GAMING CONTROL ACT AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. DOESN'T DISTINGUISH IN THIS AREA BETWEEN. APPLICATION APPROVALS OR DENIALS SO ACTUALLY BY THE CURRENT PROCESS OF NOT HAVING EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS FOR IT ALL THE APPROVALS WHICH ARE MANY. OTHERS THERE'S TENSION IMPOSSIBLE A CONFLICT WITH THE CAMERA CONTROL ACTS WE DID MAKE A LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS LEGISLATURE REVISIT THAT THAT TAXED. THAT LANGUAGE IN THE IN THE STATUTE AND DETERMINE WHETHER THEY CAN MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR TO THE CURB THE COMMISSION WHAT'S EXPECTED IN TERMS OF THE RIGHTS OF APPLICANTS AND WHEN THEY WHEN THEY MUST BE PROVIDED HEARING EVEN IF THEY DON'T ACTIVELY. PROACTIVELY REQUEST ONE. THE LAST AREA ALL SPEAK ABOUT HAS TO DO WITH ISSUES IN IN REGULATIONS IN IN IN IN POLICY. REGARDING OF THE FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT OF ALL APPLICANTS IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS THAT THEY GO THROUGH. I'LL PREFACE THIS BY SAYING WHEN WE REVIEWED INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS. AND THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE APPLICATIONS WE DID NOT IDENTIFY. ANY ANY APPLICATIONS WERE THAT WERE THAT WERE IDENTICAL IN CIRCUMSTANCE BUT RECEIVED. DIFFERENT OUTCOMES THAT SAIDTHAT'S A RELATIVELY TALL ORDER IN SO FAR AS THERE ARE MANY MANY FACTORS THAT PLAYING A LOT OF THESE. WHAT WE DID FIND HOWEVER WAS A DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SCRUTINY BEING YOU KNOW BEING AYE AYE ARE SORRY. APPLICANTS BEING SUBJECTED TO DIFFERENT VARYING LEVELS OF SCRUTINY DIFFERENT ASK QUESTIONS DIFFERENT WAYS. REGULATIONS THAT APPLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INITIAL SCREW NEEDED DIFFERENT APPLICATION TYPES WITHOUT. REAL JUSTIFICATION AND GIVEN THE DISCRETION OF THESE ENTITIES HAVE. I SHOULDN'T HIGHWAY THAT ULTIMATELY THE GAMING CONTROL COMMISSION AS YOU KNOW AS THE- TROLL ACT STATES NEEDS TO BE. CONVINCED THAT APPLICANTS OF GOOD ORAL. CHARACTER GRANT THEM A LICENSE AT THE JACK GIVES ASSESSMENT BUT THEY THEY REACH BY YOU KNOW EVERY INDUCTIVE PROCESS OF DIGGING THROUGH BACK ON INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THAT DISCRETION WE FEEL IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT THAT EVERY APPLICANT BE SUBJECTED TO THE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT LEVEL OF TREATMENT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS TO RULE OUT THAT THAT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SORT OF BIAS OR ILL INTENTIONED SO WE DESIGN REGULARLY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT WITH AS I GO THROUGH THAT ARE AT YOUR- INTENDED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. THE FINAL GRAPHICAL POINT YOU TO IS ON PAGE SIX OF YOUR PACKET. AND THIS IS A SUMMARY OF SOME KEY AREAS OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SORRY REGULATIONS. THAT THE COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHERE WE SAW. SOME SOME SIGNIFICANT. DISCREPANCIES INCONSISTENCIES THAT DIDN'T REALLY APPEAR TO US TO HAVE IT OUT WARRANTED JUSTIFICATION. AS YOU CAN KIND OF GATHER VISUALLY A LOT OF THESE INCONSISTENCIES HAVE TO DO WITH IT DISK. DISTINCTION BETWEEN KHARTOUM APPLICANTS AND THIRD PARTY APPLICANTS NOT HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE FOR YOU. UNLIKE CARDROOM APPLICANTS THIRD PARTY APPLICANTS WHEN THEY APPLY FOR A TEMPORARY STATUS NEED TO ONLY UNDERGO A BASIC BACKGROUND CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK I DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE MORE VOLUMINOUS OR IN IN INVASIVE ARE INVOLVED. NO INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION THAT. MANY OTHER APPLICANTS IN THE CARD ROOM SIDE TOO AND AS A RESULT THEY'RE ABLE TO KIND OF. WORK IN PERPETUITY WITHOUT EVEN ACTUALLY BEING SUBJECTED TO HAVING TO PUT THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER AND AGAIN THERE ARE NO REAL TIME LINES ASSOCIATE WITH THAT REGISTRY THAT WE CALL A REGISTRANT STATUS. OBVIOUS AIDS IT DISCREPANCIES IN TERMS OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THE APPLICANT BUT ALSO KINDA UNJUSTIFIED DISCREPANCIES IN TERMS OF A RISK TO THE PUBLIC IF THE IF THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROCESS IS TO GET PEOPLE IN A TIMELY MANNER BECAUSE THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE INDUSTRY WARRANT SAID. THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME THE SAME PROCESS OR AT LEAST A PROCESS THAT IS COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR AREA OF THEIR LEVEL OF INFLUENCE OR- AUTHORITY IN THE INDUSTRY. AS THE STATE AUDITOR ALLUDED TO THERE'S ALSO DISCREPANCIES ABOUT HOW LONG A THIRD PARTY APPLICANT CAN KEEP THEIR TEMPORARY REGISTRANT STATUS EVEN IF THE BUREAU MAY HAVE RECOMMENDED DENIAL TO THEN I'LL SPEAK TO THE COMMISSION AND IN MANY CASES THE COMMISSION MUST HOLD AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING BEFORE THAT THAT APPLICANT THAT THEIR PARTY APPLICANT CAN ACTUALLY BE THEIR TEMPORARY STATUS CAN BE REVOKED SO ANOTHER AREA OF ANY WHICH EVEN A POTENTIAL. RISK FINALLY THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AMONG AMONG CARDROOM TYPES IN TERMS OF WHO IS ENTITLED TO NOTICE ABOUT THE COMPLETENESS OF APPLICATION WHO IS ENTITLED TO. TIME FRIEND WHOSE OBJECTIVE TIME FRAMES FOR REVIEW FOR CERTAIN THINGS SO THERE'S A PATCHWORK QUALITY TO THE RECORD TO THE REGULATIONS THAT WE FOUND WAS UNWARRANTED INTO COULD CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTE TO PERCEPTIONS OF PEOPLE BEING TREATED. DIFFERENTLY WITHOUT WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION. WITH RESPECT TO US SO WE DID MAKE REVIEW A SORRY RECOMMENDATION TO THE TO THE COMMISSION IT WAS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THIS BUT WE HIGHLIGHTED A BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THESE. INCONSISTENCIES BE ADDRESSED SO WE DID MAKE A RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY SUBMIT DRAFT REGULATIONS BY MAY TWENTY TWENTY TO THE OFFICE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. IN TO INCREASE CONSISTENCY AMONG THESE TIGHTS. OF APPLICATIONS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR THE APPLICANTS. THE COMMISSION I'M SURE WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT THEY'VE THEY'VE DRAFTED REGULATIONS AND HAVE BEEN I BELIEVE SCHEDULING PUBLIC MEETINGS AND I BELIEVE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD IS UP YOUR ONGOING HAS MAYBE ALREADY. CLOSED SO THAT'S OF A WORK IN PROGRESS WE WILL BE MONITORING THAT. WITH RESPECT TO THE BUREAU'S. PROCEDURES INTERNALLY FOR HOW IT HOW IT TREATS APPLICANTS OR HOW IT SUBJECTS APPLICANTS TO LEVELS OF SCRUTINY WHILE REVIEWING THEM. WE FOUND THAT THEY HAD PROCEDURES THAT WERE INCONSISTENT FROM TYPE TO TYPE. DECENTRALIZED AMONG ITS VARIOUS UNITS AND WE'RE NOT ALWAYS COMMENSURATE WITH THE LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT THOSE. LICENSE HOLDERS WERE EXPECTED TO HAVE IN THE INDUSTRY. POTENTIALLY BECAUSE OF THAT WE SAW SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN THE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY OR TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT APPLICANTS WERE ASKED. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS WE FOUND ONE APPLICANT WHO. A NUMBER OF APPLICANTS WHO WERE CHASTISED BY THE BUREAU IN THEIR OFFICIAL REPORT TO THE COMMISSION FOR FILING LATE. LATE APPLICATIONS THAT BEGUN WORKING IN AND A CARD ROOM. LONGER THAN THE ALLOWED PRE BEFORE FILING A FORMAL APPLICATION. ARE WE SAW ANOTHER INSTANCE IN WHICH A AN INDIVIDUAL FILED AN APPLICATION THAT STATED VERY CLEARLY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING IN A CARBON FOR MULTIPLE YEARS. AND I'M LICENSED CAPACITY AND HAVE BEEN DOING SO WELL UNDER THE MANDATORY AGE OF TWENTY ONE. EITHER THAT WAS NOT CAUGHT WAS NOT REMARKED UPON FOR OTHER REASONS BY THE BUREAU AND THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS BATES BASICALLY MOVED VERY CLEANLY THROUGH THE LICENSING PROCESS. IN THE CASES OF ONE OF IN THE CASE OF ONE OF THE FORMER GROUP I TALKED ABOUT. WHO FOR WHOM THAT THE BUREAU HIGHLIGHTED DELAYED APPLICATION. THAT INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS ULTIMATELY DENIED BUT AS I WE TO BEFORE THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED IN THERE SO WE CAN ATTRIBUTE THE DENIAL TO THAT. TO THAT THAT DISCREPANCY HOWEVER AS I STATED. WITHOUT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THERE'S A STRICT MATHEMATICAL. FORMULA THAT THAT THE THAT THE COMMISSION FOLLOWED REGION'S DETERMINATIONS AND SO. EVERY PIECE OF IT NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENT AND FAIR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. FINALLY WE IDENTIFIED A PROCEDURAL ISSUE AT THE COMMISSION WELL WITH RESPECT TO ALLOWING. INDIVIDUALS TO KIND OF OCT OUT OF THE PROCESS. ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT THE THAT STATE LAW AND REGULATIONS MAKE. THE HOLDING OF AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING MANDATORY FOR CASES OF DENIAL. HOWEVER WE IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHO WHILE AWAITING THEIR EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS. STATE VERY CLEARLY TO COMMISSION STAFF THAT THEY NO LONGER WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS SOMETIMES. BE IT VIA EMAIL ONE INDIVIDUAL EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD CONSULTED WITH HIS ATTORNEYS AND BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE. AND DIDN'T WANT TO PROCEED ANOTHER INDICATED THAT THE CARD ON THE AT WORK AND HAD BURNED DOWN AND THEY LEFT THE INDUSTRY. SO WE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOUR FAIRLY CLEARLY EXPRESSING A LACK OF INTENT TO PURSUE LICENSURE IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER THE BEER AT THE COMMISSION WHEN A HAND HELD EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS IN THOSE INSTANCES IN THIS PART OF THAT OPENED UP THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD AND HAD. ATTORNEYS SUBMIT EVIDENCE AGAINST THOSE APPLICANTS SUITABILITY. SOME OF WHICH WAS THEN PUBLISHED IN THE IN THE PUBLIC DECISION THE COMMISSION'S WEBSITE. WHEN WE ASKED ABOUT THAT PROCESS THE COMMISSION YOU KNOW JUST RIGHTFULLY. EMPHASIZE THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS TO A HEARING AND THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO. DENY ANYBODY OF THOSE RIGHTS. HOWEVER WE ALSO DETERMINE THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE A FORMAL PROTOCOL FOR INFORMING APPLICANTS ABOUT HOW TO WITHDRAW FROM THAT PROCESS. THEY TOLD US THAT THEY REQUIRED FORMAL WRITTEN WITHDRAWAL FROM APPLICANTS BUT THERE WAS NO WEAPONS AT THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AND THERE ARE NO INTERNAL PROTOCOLS TO STAFF. HOW DO AND SHRUGGED INDIVIDUALS TO DO SO. WHICH WE BELIEVE COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SITUATIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE MAKING IT VERY CLEAR THEY NO LONGER WANT OUR PARTICIPATE. BUT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO THE END OF THE PROCESS. ANYWAY AT SIXTY DAYS THE COMMISSION DID PROVIDE NEW VERY COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES GUIDING STAFF ON THIS PROTOCOL AND SO. I'M FROM THEIR SIDE OF THINGS WE BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED HOWEVER THERE IS STILL THIS ON GOING ENGINE WITH THE GAMBLING CONTROL ACT. SO TO ENSURE THAT IT. THAT THAT. PEOPLE ARE THAT PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING THE OF THE HEARINGS THAT THEY WANT IF THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. IN A FAIR AND CONSISTENT WAY WITHOUT CONFLICT WITH STATUTE WE- CAN REITERATE OUR A RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE TO REVISIT THAT STATUTORY LANGUAGE FINALLY I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW AREAS THAT WE LOOKED AT. THAT ARE ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO LICENSING PROCESS TO HAVE RELEVANCE AND I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE WERE AND WE'RE NOT ABLE. TO DETERMINE SOME OF THOSE AREAS ONE QUESTION WE WERE ASKED BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE WAS ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE HOW MUCH TIME ENFORCEMENT AGENTS AT THE BUREAU SPEND IN VARIOUS. ESTABLISHMENT AS PART OF THEIR INVESTIGATION AND SOMETIMES UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATION DUTIES. UNFORTUNATELY THE BUREAU DOES NOT CURRENTLY TRACKED THAT INFORMATION IN ANY CENTRALIZED AWAY. YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO EVEN INDIVIDUAL CASE FILES EVEN WHEN WE DID THAT IN THEIR SYSTEM. THE CARD ROOM IN QUESTION WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WE NEEDED TO THERE IS REALLY NO SYSTEMATIC WAY FOR US TO DETERMINE WHETHER IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF TIME BUT AGENTS WERE STANDING AT VARIOUS ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO GET TO THE CENTER THERE'S ANY CONCERN ABOUT THE% EQUITY OF THAT OR OR TARGETING OF PLACES WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE BUREAU THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE A BUSINESS NEED TO BE COLLECTING THAT DATA SO THAT THEY KNOW HOW THE RESOURCES ARE BEING UTILIZED IN THAT. YOU KNOW THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. THE OVERSIGHT GROUP SUCH AS OUR SELF TO REVIEW. WE ALSO FOUND ONE ISSUE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FUNDING THAT PAYS FOR VARIOUS POSITIONS IN THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL AS YOU MAY KNOW THE GIRL CAMPAIGN TO ALSO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRIBAL GAMING OVERSIGHT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AND AS SUCH THEY ARE ALSO FUNDED OUT OF THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUNDED JUST PAID INTO BY THOSE CASINOS THEY HAVE POSITIONS THAT ARE SLATED TO BE FUNDED BY ONE OF TWO FUNDS WHICH MAKES SENSE AND IT ALSO MADE SENSE TO US WHEN WE FOUND THAT THOSE POSITION SOMETIMES WORKED ON ISSUES THAT WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE IN TERMS OF CARDROOM VERSES. VERSUS TRIBAL CASINO INVESTIGATIONS BASED ON NEED HOWEVER WHAT WASN'T HAPPENING WAS ANY SORT OF RECONCILIATION WHERE IF AND IF AN INDIVIDUAL WAS PAID FOR OUT OF ONE FINE BUT WORKED IN THE OTHER THAT THAT THAT SECOND FUND IS MAKING THE FIRST FUND HOLE FOR THE COST AND SO WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY A TREND OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME THINGS THREE YEARS THAT WE LOOKED AT WHERE ON THE ON THE NET THE THERE WERE THERE WERE SEVERAL I THINK ALMOST THIRTY THOUSAND HOURS THAT WERE CHARGED THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND BUT WHERE WERE THE WORK WAS PERFORMED. ON CARDINAL ELECTORS THAT SHOULD BEEN PAID FOR THE CAMERA CONTROL FUND SO XIN TO THE. OTHER ISSUES WE REYES FEW TODAY THAT'S ANOTHER EXPLANATORY. WHY BRITISH BY THE FUND BALANCES CAM IS OUT OF HIS OUT OF CONTROL IN TERMS OF ITS SIZE AND SURPLUS. SO WITH THAT I THINK WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU I THINK THAT WAS A VERY THE HURDLES. OVERVIEW OF THE ENTIRE ISSUES I THINK I KNOW WHEN YOU KEEP SPEAKING. OR THE TESTIMONY KEPT GOING ON THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR THE BUREAU I THINK SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN LIMIT SOME OF OUR QUESTIONS AND GET TO THE BUREAU AND- AND THE GAMBLING COMMISSION BECAUSE I KNOW. THE OTTER LAID EVERYTHING OUT I KNOW WHEN WE FIRST APPROVED THIS AUDIT. LAST AUGUST AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THERE WAS CONCERNS THE BEER THE COMMISSION MAYBE TREATING CERTAIN APPLICANTS. DIFFERENTLY IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR TESTIMONY AT. AS WELL BUT I REMEMBER AT THE TIME ALSO THERE WERE CLAIMS OF. THIS TREATMENTS MAY BE HAPPENING BECAUSE OF. RACE OR ETHNICITY WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU FOUND TO THIS REGARD. THERE THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WE FOUND IN THAT REGARD DEFINITIVELY ATTRIBUTING ANY OF THE TREATMENT TO TEN TEN BASED ON ON ON ANY SORT OF RACIAL CHARACTERISTIC OR ANY OTHER SUCH CHARACTERISTIC AS WE DO STAY IN IN THE REPORT HOWEVER NEITHER OF THESE ENTITIES. TRACK THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THE APPLICANT CENTERS OR SYSTEMATIC WAY SO THAT ANY AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO SAY DEFINITIVELY WENT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER ANY SEARCH DISCRIMINATION OCCURRED HOWEVER WEWERE CERTAINLY A TUNE TO THAT WHEN WE PROVIDE MANY PERFORMER IN DEPTH REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL FILES AND IF THERE WERE SOMETHING THAT. STRUCK US AS PROBLEMATIC WE WOULD DEFINITELY PURSUED IT OKAY A TWENTY MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THAT SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP WHEN THE AUDIT REQUEST CAME BEFORE THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE AS WELL SO WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO TO HOPEFULLY SOME BRIEF QUESTIONS AND THEN GET ACTUALLY INTO THE SECOND PANEL WHICH I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS ON FOR THE- THE BUREAU. IN THE COMMISSION SO WITH THAT WILL FIRST BEGIN WITH SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SERENITY. THE FEW QUESTIONS YOU'VE BEEN VERY THOROUGH BUT TYWIN AT APPLICATION COMES IN I'M ASSUMING THAT THE BUREAU OPENS A FILE. AND WITH THAT FILE HAVE A PROGRAM. SORT OF A YOU'RE THE THIRTY QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ASK WERE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS. SUFFICIENT WITH THE APPLICATION A TATTERED CENTERS YOU JUST HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH EVERY APPLICANT. THAT TYPE OF SYSTEMATIC APPROACH WAS NOT HAPPENING DURING OUR REVIEW AT THE TIME OF RECEIPT OF THE APPLICATION THEY WERE INDEED OPENING THE FILE. SCANNING IT COPYING IT PREPARING IT BUT THERE WAS NO A CHECK AGAINST DOES THIS DOES THIS FILE HAVE ALL THE MATERIALS WE WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD THAT WAS LEFT TO. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO ALTERNATELY PICK THAT FILE UP ON THE ON THE ANALYST'S SIDE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AS I SAID SOMETIMES IT DIDN'T HAPPEN FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS WHY YOU USE THE TERM DIFFERENT SCRUTINY. SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A CONSISTENT PROCESS FOR ALL APPLICANTS. CERTAINLY AT. AND IN TERMS OF THAT SCREWED ME ALSO I WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO. THE TO THE BUREAU THAT ON THE ANALYST SIDE ON THE BACK ON USE ACTUALLY GOING THAT THERE ARE ARE MORE CENTRALIZING CONSISTENT PROTOCOLS FOR WHAT QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE ASKED EACH APPLICANT. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE. FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS THAT TAKE YOU IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS BUT THAT THE COR PROCEDURES NEED TO BE. CONSISTENT AND COMMENSURATE WITH OF THE LEVEL OF INCREASE THAT'S APPROPRIATE. FOR ANY OUTSIDE SERVICES UTILIZED. I'M NOT APART FROM THE I. GLS LEGAL REVIEW THAT I DISCUSSED WHO AND THEY ALSO PROVIDE LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO THE BUREAU AND IN LITIGATION AND IN. FOR PRESENTING BEFORE THE COMMISSION I'M NOT AWARE OF CONTRACTED SERVICES IN THIS AREA PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS NO LEXIS NEXIS MAYBE NO GOOGLE SEARCH. SO THEY SIR I'M SORRY I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION SENATOR THERE CERTAINLY AVAIL THEMSELVES OF DATABASE ENQUIRIES. THEIR STAFF WILL RUN DMB INCREASE CERTAINLY THEY WILL RUN. IMMIGRATION STATUS BACKGROUND CHECKS. SO THEY MAY THEY MAY WELL SUBSCRIBE TO THOSE SORTS OF TOOLS BUT IN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUALS PERFORMING THE REVIEWS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE BUREAU EMPLOYEES. WOULD THAT BE. SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE TIME. SENSITIVE LIKE IF YOU ASK FOR A IMMIGRATION STATUS WOULD THAT BE A WEEK TWO THREE. I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE INQUIRY THAN SOME OF THE REVIEWS CERTAINLY TAKE LONGER TO GET DAY THEY'D READING TAX INFORMATION ANY MEMOS MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION IN TERMS THE FINANCIAL SIDE WHICH WOULD BE COME FROM THE APPLICANT THEMSELVES. A LOT OF IT THE DELAYS WE SAW OUR IN TERMS OF. GOING BACK TO THE HAPPEN EITHER FOR REPEATED TIMES BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION HADN'T HAD BECOME IRRELEVANT FROM A TIME FRAME PERSPECTIVE. OR AGAIN THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS IN THE SAYS FOR COMPLETENESS UP FRONT SO THERE ARE CONTACTING AN APPLICANT. MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE BLUE SOME SOME OF TIME LATER SAYING HEY WE NEED ALL THIS MATERIALS YOU DIDN'T PROVIDED AS NECESSARY SO. I'M SURE THERE ARE DIFFERENT TIME FRAES ASSOCIATE WITH A GIVEN REQUEST I CAN VARY BUT THE SYSTEMATIC PROBLEMS SEEM TO COME FROM. THOSE INITIAL ASSESSMENTS AND HOW FEDERAL THEY WERE. SO IT'S SORT OF A HODGE PODGE MAYBE WE ASK FOR YOUR CREDIT REPORT MAYBE WE DON'T. BUT WE CAN'T TELL MANAGER HOW FAR ALONG WE ARE ON. ON THE APPLICATION WE CAN'T SAY WERE 50% COMPLETED OR WAITING FOR A REPORT FROM. YOU KNOW BRAND AXES PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION THE LIST OF THE FILES DO DO CERTAINLY REFLECTS A BACK AND FORTH WITH MANAGERS BUT I I'M I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY SORT OF SYSTEMATIC. QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF HOW LONG FAR ALONG THINGS ARE INDEED. THOSE INTERACTIONS WITH MANAGERS COULD COULDN'T DELETE THE INDIVIDUAL IN FACT TO GO BACK IN AND A NEW LINE OF QUESTIONING SO. ALL ALL GETTING BACK TO OUR NOTION OF THE NEEDS TO BE OF THE STATE I CONSISTENT CORE SET OF PROCEDURES THAT EVERYBODY'S SUBJECTED TO INITIALLY AND THE RETENTION ISSUE WHICH PREVENTED US FROM DETERMINING THAT ALL THE STUFF FOR TAKING CONSISTENTLY IN EACH CASE IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT THE- UREAU HAS. AS BECOME WORKING TO RESOLVE SO WHAT WOULD BE THE MINIMUM TIME REQUIRED TO DO A- AN APPLICATION APPROVAL. A WEEK. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE FACTORS HIT WITH WITH WHAT WE SAW WHEN THEY WHEN THEY PICK THEM UP AND IF THERE WERE ANY BACK AND FORTH THE APPLE CAN I DON'T THINK I COULD GIVE YOU A MINIMUM TIME PERIOD DID YOU DO ANY PEER REVIEW LIKE CONTACTING THE STATE OF NEVADA. TO SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES WRITTEN OR QUICKLY CAN BE DONE IF IT WERE DONE WE DID NOT. DO WE HAVE ANY INCENTIVES FOR STAFF. ORDER IT WITH WHAT WE DO TO MOTIVATE THE ENVIRONMENT. TO GET THINGS DONE IN A IN A TIMELY MANNER OR FASHION DID YOU HAVE ANY WHAT WHAT KIND OF MANAGEMENT TOOLS DO WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE. EFFICIENCIES. WELL CERTAINLY AS WAS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY ENSURING THAT STAFF ARE UTILIZING THEIR TIME IN THE AREAS OF IN PROPORTION TO WHAT THEY SHOULD BE WE IDENTIFY A LOT OF TIME BEING SPENT ON WHAT THE IN THE BEER DESCRIBE US AS TRAINING OR MEETINGS OR OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS THAT AGAIN EACH IN A VACUUM ARE WE TECHNOLOGIST NEED TO HAPPEN BUT WHEN THEY'RE HAPPENING AT NEARLY 50% OF THE OVERALL TIME BEING SPENT BY THE STAFF IT BECOMES. INCREASINGLY PROBLEMATIC AND CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED INEFFICIENCIES DID YOU SEE ANY TERMINATIONS. WHILE YOU WERE THERE WE DIDN'T WE DID NOT SEE THAT I DID WITHIN SPECIFIC WE TEST FOR TERMINATIONS BUT I'M NOT NUMBER NUMBER BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION SO THERE WAS NO ONE THAT YOU WERE AWARE OF OR SAID. WAS NOT COMPLETING WORK IN A- SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME. WE DIDN'T SEE ANYONE SUBJECT ANY SORT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS GROUNDS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU THANK CENTER THOSE ARE PROBABLY RELEVANT QUESTIONS TO FOR THE NEXT PANEL BUT ALSO AS WE BEGIN BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS AGAIN NEXT YEAR THE SUBCOMMITTEES AS WE ALLOCATED SOME MONEY SO I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THEIR ANSWERS ARE AS WELL THE EXPANDED AT NON BILLABLE HOURS AT THE OUTER TALKED ABOUT AS WELL WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. AND SENATOR ARCHULETA SO SOMEONE OR PATTERSON THANK YOU. BRISTOL APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU DO COUPLE THINGS THAT ARE A BIT TROUBLING AND I'D LIKE TO ASK A LITTLE. BIT OF. CLARITY IN SOME DETAIL. I THINK WE HEARD THAT. YOU HAVE CONCLUDED THE POTENTIAL. THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FEES ARE COLLECTED AND EXPANDED. THAT THIS MAY GET CLOSE TO AN UNLAWFUL TAX. WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT IN A BIT MORE DETAIL I THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT FINDING THAT NEEDS A BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING ON OUR PART. CERTAINLY UNFORTUNATELY OUR ATTORNEY WHO WORKED ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IS IN HERE BUT BUT BASICALLY WHEN YOU CHARGE A FEE YOU'RE CHARGING A FEE FOR A SPECIFIC SERVICE. AND WHAT WE SAW AT THE BUREAU IS THERE ARE LICENSING APPLICANTS WHO ARE SUBMITTING. ARE BEING CHARGED A FEE AND THEN THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS FOR NON REGULATORY TYPE ACTIVITIES OR NON LICENSING ACTIVITIES BEING CHARGED A FEE. AND THERE'S A DISPARITY AND SO I'M PAYING A FEE BUT I'M NOT GETTING A COMMENSURATE SERVICE EQUIVALENT TO THAT FEE. AND ON THE FLIP SIDE I'M I'M PAYING A FEE. AND I'M GETTING THE EXPENDITURES ARE EXCEEDING WHAT THAT PARTICULAR FEE IS FOR SO IF YOU CHARGE A FEE AND YOU DO NOT HAVE A SERVICE THAT'S COMMENSURATE TO THAT BE. THEN BASED ON ARE TURNING AGAINST MISTER PATTERSON I APOLOGIZE ARE TURNING WASN'T AVAILABLE THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A TAX RATHER THAN FOR A FEE WOULD YOU CONSIDER THIS. TO BE A AN EXAMPLE OF THE FAILURE TO MAKE A SATISFACTORY NEXUS TEST BETWEEN THE FEE AND ITS USE ABSOLUTELY YES THAT'S THE CONCERN WE HAVE OKAY AND THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THE AT THE BUREAU NEEDS TO GO BACK AND DO A THOROUGH ANALYSIS. OF THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES FOR ALL OF THEIR DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR FEE STRUCTURE IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THERE IS NOT THAT NEXUS THERE AT THIS. TIME WITH RESPECT TO THE MORATORIUM. I FOR INSTANCE UNSETTLING. DESCRIPTORS HERE. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR AUDIT UNFAIR AND POTENTIALLY BIASED. MET THAT THAT'S TROUBLING. CAN YOU WANT CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE. IF YOU GET INTO A GETTING TO A MORATORIUM ON A MORATORIUM IS ESSENTIALLY AN UNFAIR FREEZING OF ON EQUAL SETS OF CIRCUMSTANCES IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT DECISION TO INSTITUTE A MORATORIUM. IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR BECAUSE IT FREEZES DIFFERENTIAL OUTCOMES LE LET ME JUST INTERJECT THE REAL QUICK BECAUSE I KNOW THE MORATORIUM DISCUSSIONS PROBABLY DISCUSSION I KNOW IS ANOTHER DEBATE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND I WANT TO ALLOW THE AUDITOR TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THIS AUDIT REPORTS SO. I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU'D LIKE TO A PINE ON OTHER ISSUES. BUT FOR THIS HEARING I'M HOPING TO STICK TO THE AUDIT. WELL MISTER CHAIR WE DO HAVE SHERMAN EXCUSE ME THE WHAT. I THOUGHT THE PRESENTATION HAD YEAH SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED A MORATORIUM I'M TRYING TO DIRECTLY TO THE TO THE RIGHT SUBSTANCE OF THIS AUDIT CORRECT I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IT TO THE SCOPE OF THE ACTUAL WATER REPORT BECAUSE I KNOW THE TIMES I BIG PASSED BECAUSE I WAS WHEN I WAS QUESTIONING WITHIN THAT. WITH THAT THAT PLEASES HOW RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AS YOU SAID MISS PATTERSON WE DO HAVE A DISCUSSION IN THE REPORT ABOUT THE MORATORIUM WE DON'T GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL AND I WOULD DEFER TO THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION WITH RESPECT TO THAT. WE HAVE A DISCUSSION IN THE REPORT ABOUT WHAT. THE CONCERNS WERE THAT THERE WAS LITIGATION FILED AND THAT BASICALLY AT THIS POINT THEY'RE AT ARBITRATION SO WE DIDN'T DRILL DOWN DEEPLY INTO. THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO THE MUCH MORATORIUM WE DO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME. THIS MUCH MORATORIUM HAS BEEN IN PLACE AND THAT THEY NEED TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED IN FAIRNESS TO VARIOUS FACILITIES GARMENT CAR RIMS THANK YOU. MISTER MY UNDERSTANDING APPRECIATION FOR. A TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF I WILL RAISE THESE QUESTIONS TO DIRECT AND- TO THEM AT THE TIME OF THEIR PRESENTATION BUT I REALLY DO THINK UNDERSTAND. THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE SCOPE OF ALL THIS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE. CIRCUMSTANCES ARE AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDITOR AND THEN GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. THE TO THE DEPARTMENT TO RESPOND BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO REALLY DRILL DOWN. INTO WHAT IS. EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT LANGUAGE WHEN YOU COME UP WITH ON FAIR OR POTENTIALLY BIASED TO DETERMINATIONS. AND I GET BACK TO THIS WHOLE WHOLE TWO. POINT OF DUE PROCESS YOU. EITHER HAVE A DUE PROCESS TO GET YOU TO A DECISION THAT'S FAIR. OR YOU HAVE. A DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE RIGHTS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO GO BEFORE. A GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND ASK FOR A- DECISION. AND WITH WHAT WE HAVE TO GET TO A DECISION THAT IS FAIR UNBIASED. WITHOUT INCONSISTENCIES WITHOUT DELAYS OR I THINK WE FAIL ON THE FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY. OF A BUREAUCRACY TO PRESENT DUE PROCESS. LOOKING FOR THOSE ANSWERS AS WELL IN THE NEXT PANEL ESPECIALLY THE ALIGNMENT OF THE FEES I WITHOUT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. YEAH WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR PORT VERY DETAILED. THEY'LL FORMAL TRAINING PROGRAM OVER THERE FOR THEIR AUDITOR'S INVESTIGATORS. THE TRAINING OF THEIR STAFF ON THAT'S IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE THAT WE LOOKED INTO SO DEFERRED OF THE ENTITY ABOUT HOW THEY TRAIN THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. IS THERE A HIGH TURNOVER RATE OVER THERE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OVER AGAIN THAT THE BUREAU EXPRESSED THEY THEY- COULD CHALLENGE OF. HIRING RETAINING PEOPLE TO US AT A HIGH LEVEL OUR OUR STE OUR STAFFING ANALYSIS FOUND THAT IN TERMS OF FILL POSITIONS THE THAT WAS FOR THE RIVER TO CONSISTENTLY INCREASING OR THE PERIOD OF TIME SO I WAS REALLY OUR OUR FOCUS. IS HE SAID. THE TURN OVER SOME POINT THERE'S THERE WAS SOME TURNOVER HARD PROBLEMS NOT SOMETHING WE QUANTIFY I DEFER TO THEM ON THE ACTUAL QUANTIFICATION OF THE TURNOVER THEY- THEY HAD THEY DID REFERENCE TO US A LINK THE HIRING PROCESS THAT HAS TO DO WITH. THAT THE BACKGROUND THAT THEY'RE INDIVIDUALLY TO GO THROUGH BUT AGAIN I WOULD TO FOR THEM TO THE SPECIFICS WE WERE FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT THEY HAD PERSON NOW. FILLING THOSE SEATS AS REQUESTED FROM THE LEGISLATURE. AND THOSE PEOPLE WERE AND NOT. TO SEE TO BE PRODUCTIVE GIVEN THE NUMBERS THAT WE ANALYZED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITHOUT SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE DÃ­AS I'M EAGER TO. MOVE INTO THE NEXT PANEL IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY THOROUGHLY. SETTING THE TABLE HERE SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER THREE WHICH IS COMMENTS AND RESPONSES. ON THE OTHER FROM THE AGENCIES WITH US TODAY IS STUFF NATION. SHE KNEW SHE SHE MIGHT SERVE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU GAMBLING CONTROL CC LUNA BAXTER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE LOTS OF DISCUSSION AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR TESTIMONY WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE BEGIN. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SALAS CHAIRMAN DON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S DEFINITION MASSU AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU FAMILY CONTROL WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOUR FOR SARAH AND MYSELF WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. TO DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN THEIR FINDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE BUREAU AND OUR EFFORTS INCREASING EFFICIENCIES IN ADDRESSING ALL THE AUDITOR'S CONCERNS. THE FIRST I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THOSE WHO REQUESTED THE AUDIT. WHICH IS THE ASSERTION THAT THE BUREAU MAYBE TREATING APPLICANTS DIFFERENTLY. AND I'M FAIRLY BASED ON THE REST RACE OR ETHNICITY AND SPECIFICALLY THE CLAIM THAT ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS MAYBE THE FOCUS OF UNNECESSARY INVESTIGATIONS AND DISPARAGEMENT. WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THIS ASSERTION AND HAVE NOT BEEN OFFERED ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEM. AND WHILE THE AUDITOR STAFF DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE OF THE BUREAU TREATED APPLICANTS AND FAIRLY BASED ON RECENT AT THIS AT THE CITY. IT INDICATED THAT WASN'T ABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE THE BUREAU DOES NOT REQUEST OR MAINTAIN THAT INFORMATION TO BE CLEAR THE BUREAU HAS NEVER REQUESTED OR MAINTAINED THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION ABOUT APPLICANTS RACE OR ETHNICITY. I'M NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT A FACTOR THAT WE CONSIDER IN THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY PROHIBITED FROM LAW. BY LAW FROM REQUIRING THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION. NOW THE EFFORT ALTHOUGH THE INFORMATION COULD BE COLLECTED ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS I'M AT THIS TIME THE BUREAU DOES NOT PLAN TO DO SO UNLESS DIRECTED TO DO SO BY THE LEGISLATURE. SINCE WE FIRST LEARNED OF THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAIN WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH ANY INFORMATION TO SUPPORT SUCH CLAIMS. AS I PREVIOUSLY INDICATED TO SOME MEMBERS. SHOULD I RECEIVE ANY SPECIFIC CLAIMS. I WOULD BE HAPPY DISCUSS THEM WITH THE APPLICANTS CONSENT. TO TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFIC AT THE SPECIFICS OF ANY FINDINGS. AND THE REASONS WHY WE MAY HAVE RECOMMENDED APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL. WITHOUT THAT WE ARE JUST LEFT WITH. BASICALLY BASELESS CLAIMS TO WHICH I CAN'T RESPOND. I'D LIKE TO SURE YOU HAVE THE RAINY EVIDENCE OF THE BUREAU ACTING IN A RACIST AND DISCRIMINATORY MANNER ATTORNEY GENERAL THIS ERA AND I WOULD HAVE FOUND SUCH ACTIONS COMPLETELY OFFENSIVE. UNACCEPTABLE AND WOULD ADDRESS THEM IMMEDIATELY. I'D NOW LIKE TO TURN TO THE ISSUE OF THE BACK LOT CASES. AND DESCRIBE THE POLICIES THE BUREAU HAS IMPLEMENTED SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE AUDIT. FIRST THE AUDITOR DETERMINED THAT THE BUREAU REGULARLY EXCEEDED THE STATUTORY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME FOR COMPLETING ITS REVIEW OF LICENSE APPLICATIONS AND FAILED TO NOTIFY APPLICANTS OF THE STATUS OF THEIR APPLICATIONS AT. THIS POINT IN THE PROCESS AS REQUIRED. SECOND THE AUDITOR DETERMINED THAT THE BUREAU STOPPED ISSUING DECISIONS ON CERTAIN GAMES. APPLICATIONS WHICH PLACE SOME KARDAM OWNERS AT A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO OFFER GAMES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PLAYED AND OTHER CARD ROOMS. THE BILL DOES NOT DISAGREE WITH ANY OF THESE FINDINGS. THE BILL HAS BEEN ADDRESSING A BACKLOG OF APPLICATIONS IN HIS LICENSING SECTION OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND HAS BEEN WORKING TO REDUCE IT WITH THE ADDITIONAL LIMITED FUNDED STAFF. THAT THE- LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TO US IN FISCAL YEARS FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FOR NUMBERS AS OF JULY THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE NUMBER OF PENDING APPLICATIONS WITH THE BUREAU IS ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY NINE. OF THOSE APPLICATIONS NINE HUNDRED OF FORTY SIX HAVE BEEN IN THE BUREAU LONGER THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. WHICH EXCEEDS THE TIME FRAME FOR COMPLETING THIS REVIEW WAS REQUIRED. THE BUREAU CONSIDERS THESE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX CASES TO BE THE BACKLOG AND NOT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PENDING APPLICATIONS BEFORE US. IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO GET TO ZERO BECAUSE EVERY DAY WE CONTINUOUSLY RECEIVE NEW APPLICATIONS. LAST YEAR THE BEER RECEIVED ABOUT SIXTY THREE HUNDRED NEW APPLICATIONS. APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND INITIAL APPLICATIONS AND TWENTY THREE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS TO RENEW LICENSES. OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLETE OUR REVIEW WITHIN THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY TIME PERIOD AS REQUIRED. AND AS A WILL DESCRIBE SHORTLY WE ARE WORKING ON PROCESSES IMPLANTS TO STEADILY DECREASE THE BACKLOG SO THE WE MEET THESE GOALS. AND WHILE WE WORK ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BACKLOGGED APPLICATIONS WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING APPLICANTS KNOW THE STATUS OF THEIR CASES. IN EARLY APRIL WE CREATED IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ALL REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS ARE SENT. TO APPLICANTS WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT REVIEWING APPLICATIONS TO TRY TO DETERMINE THE COMPLETENESS IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT. AND THE NOTIFY THE APPLICATION APPLICANTS OF ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT WE FOUND. THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED THAT WE IDENTIFY DELAYS IN OUR BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION PROCESS AND ADDRESS THEM. IF YOU'RE A BREEZE AND IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING OUR PROCESSES TO DETERMINE WHERE CERTAIN DELAYS MAY EXIST IN THE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THEM. THIS MAY REQUIRE CHANGING PROCESSES AND ELIMINATING SOME STEPS OUR INVESTIGATIONS THAT MAYBE UNNECESSARY OR INEFFICIENT. THROUGH INTERNAL BUREAU DISCUSSIONS WE WERE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY SOMETHING SO WE THINK MAY BE THE CAUSE OF SOME DELAYS AND ADDRESS THEM. SO WE HIRED AN IN HOUSE ATTORNEY TO REVIEW TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE SOMETIMES DELAYED DUE TO THE WORKLOAD BY THE INDIAN GAMING LAW SECTION IN THE AG'S OFFICE. WE MORE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED REQUEST FOR EXTENSIONS FROM APPLICANTS. AND WE HAVE BEEN CROSS TRAINING ANALYSTS TO BE ABLE TO WORK ALL LICENSE TYPES TO THE WE CAN SHIFT THEM AROUND BASED ON NEED. BEYOND WHAT THE OTHER HAS RECOMMENDED WE ARE PUTTING EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAY ELIMINATE DELAYS. AS WE MOVE TOWARD OUR GOAL OF GETTING TO THAT GETTING EVERYTHING DONE WITHIN THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME. OUR NEXT SPOTS THE AUDITOR IS DUE NOVEMBER. AT WHICH TIME WE PLAN TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIC PLAN ON HOW TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG AND BE READY TO IMPLEMENT. WITH RESPECT TO GAMES APPLICATIONS AT THE END OF JULY THE BUREAU BEGAN ISSUING TEMPORARY APPROVALS FOR SOME GAMES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING OFFERED FOR PLAY ANOTHER CARD ROOMS. AND WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THESE TYPES OF DECISIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS. ANOTHER ISSUE THE AUDITOR FOUND WAS THAT THE FEES CHARGED APPLICANTS AND OWNERS DON'T ALIGN WITH THE COST OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE BUREAU. WE'RE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING ANALYSIS OF ALL THE BUREAUS COSTS AND WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION TO ALIGN THE VARIOUS FEES WITH THE COST OF SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY THE AUDITOR INDICATED THAT WE WERE NOT BILLION PROPERLY. AND THE STAFF FOR SPENDING FAR TOO MUCH TIME ON NON BILLABLE AND ON CASE WORK. AS A JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT NON BILLABLE TIME IS THIS IS A TERM THAT WE USE FOR TIME ASSOCIATED WITH THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. OF FOR WHICH ANALYSTS EITHER COULD NOT BILL BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY AUTHORITY TO DO SO. OR THEY SIMPLY DID NOT BILL SUCH AS WHEN AN EXPERIENCED ANALYST TRAINS A LESS EXPERIENCE ANALYST HE WOULD NOT BILL FOR THAT TIME BUT WOULD STILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTIGATION. NON CASE TIMES TIME THAT COULD NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC INVESTIGATION. SUCH AS ONE ANALYST RESPOND TO GENERAL QUESTIONS FROM THE INDUSTRY. WHEN THEY WORK ON SPECIAL PART PROJECTS OR WHEN THEY ARE RESPONDING TO THINGS LIKE SUBPOENAS AND PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. SO IT'S WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT IT WASN'T ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC CASE. IN LATE APRIL THE BUREAU IMPLEMENTED A NEW POLICY ON TIME TRACKING WHICH ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR BILLABLE NON BILLABLE AND NON CASE TIME. ALL NON BILLABLE AND NON CASE TIME MUST BE PRE APPROVED BY MANAGERS. BEFORE IT'S DONE. AND ONE VERY POSITIVE OUTCOME WE FOUND FROM THIS CHANGE IS THE INCREASE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN US AND OUR STAFF. THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF A LICENSING AND I MEET WITH ANALYST EVERY MONTH WITHOUT THEIR MANAGERS TO IT TALK ABOUT THINGS AND TO GET THEIR DIRECT INPUT ON HEALTH THINGS ARE WORKING. EVERY OTHER WEEK WE MEET WITH ALL THE MANAGERS AND REVIEW EACH ANALYST TIME. SO THIS ALLOWS US TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR POLICY INDETERMINATE WHERE WE MEET IN MANY TO SHIFT RESOURCES TO CERTAIN LICENSE TYPES. IS ALSO TIME TO HEAR OUR POLICIES ARE WORKING OR NOT WORKING AND HOW WE NEED TO KEEP ADJUSTING THEM. THE OTHER RECOMMENDED THAT WE ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS FOR BILLABLE NON BILLABLE AND NOT CASE TIME WHICH WE'VE RECENTLY CREATED TO ENABLE US TO DETECT MORE ISSUES QUICKLY. WHEN THE AUDITOR CONDUCTED ITS REVIEW IT CONCLUDED THAT ANALYSTS WERE SPENDING 12% OF THEIR TIME ON BILLABLE TIME 40% ON ON BILLABLE TIME IN 48% ON NON CASE TIME. ARE ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS ARE NOW SET UP 50% BILLABLE TIME 35% FOR NON BILLABLE TIME AND 15% FOR NON CASE TIME. THAT'S WHAT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT THE NON BILLABLE TIME DOES INCLUDE WORK FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO BILL. SUCH AS WORK ON CARDROOM WORK PERMITS AND INITIAL WORK ON ON DESTINATIONS FOR THIRD PARTY PLAYERS. SO ONCE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MONTHS OF THIS DATA AND ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH. WE'RE ABLE TO BILL FOR NOT BILL FOR. WE MAY UPDATE THOSE THRESHOLDS AND RECENTLY WILL WORK WITH THE AUDITOR INFORM THEM OF ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SPECIALS WE MAKE. THE NEXT ISSUE THE AUDITOR IDENTIFIED WAS OF THE BUREAU'S PROCEDURES SUBJECTED APPLICANTS TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SCRUTINY. WITHOUT CLEAR JUSTIFICATION AND FOUND INCONSISTENCIES IN THE QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT THE KIDS. IT IS NECESSARY THAT APPLICANTS FOR SOME LICENSE TYPE ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY INHERENT IN THE LICENSEE. FOR EXAMPLE OWNERS A CARD ROOMS IN THIRD PARTY PROVIDER COMPANIES WILL UNDERGO MORE EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN FINANCE REVIEWS COMPARE TO INDIVIDUALS SEEKING DEALER WORK PERMITS OR THOSE SEEKING LICENSES TO BECOME THIRD PARTY PROVIDER PLAYERS. DURING THE AUDIT WE REVIEWED OUR INDIVIDUAL POLICIES FOR EACH OF THE VARIOUS LICENSE TYPES YOU DETERMINE WHICH REQUIREMENTS MAYBE UNNECESSARY AND REMOVE THEM. AND THEN WE CREATED A SINGLE SET OF PROCEDURES FOR WORK PERMITS PARTY PLAYERS AND SUPERVISORS THANK YOU EMPLOYEES. SO NOW ANALYSTS WHO WORK ON THESE INVESTIGATIONS WORK FROM ONE SET OF INITIAL PROCEDURES. AND WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME ADDITIONAL CHOIR MINTS FOR THOSE LICENSEE TYPES THE REQUIRE A MORE IN DEPTH REVIEW NO ONE UNIT IS ABLE TO CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS SOLELY FOR THEIR LICENSE TYPE. WE FOUND THE COMBINING POLICIES PROCEDURES HAS THE ADDED BENEFITOF ENABLING AN EASIER TRANSITION FOR ANALYSTS WHO MAY ASSIST WITH OTHER LICENSE TYPES WE MOVE THEM AROUND TO HELP WITH OTHER LICENSE TYPES. ON IT AND ANALYSTS USUALLY WORKS ON THIRD PARTY SUPERVISORS IS NEEDED TO WORK ON A CARD ROOM WORK PERMIT. NOW THEY'RE ABLE TO REFER TO THE SAME SET OF PROCEDURES INSTEAD OF PICKING UP AND TRYING TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH A WHOLE NEW SET OF PROCEDURES FROM A DIFFERENT UNIT. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON DOING THE SAME TYPE OF. SINGLE SET OF PROCEDURES FOR BOTH OWNER LICENSES FOR CARD ROOMS AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. I THINK THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE HAD TO RETHINK AND EXPRESSED TO ALL OF OUR STAFF IS THE PERCEPTION OF UNFAIRNESS. THERE ARE TIMES IN THE PAST THAT FEES WERE WAVED FROM REQUESTED BY INDUSTRY APPLICANTS OR- A C. WHEN ANALYSTS MAY HAVE FEEL GUILTY FOR BILLING FOR INVESTIGATORY WORK WHICH DIDN'T LEAD TO A DEROGATORY FINDING. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN MANAGEMENT'S PRIORITIZE MATTERS OVER OTHERS UPON REQUEST BY THE APPLICANT WEREN'T OFFICIAL. THERE ALSO TIMES THE MANAGERS BEGAN ROUTINELY DIRECTING THEIR STAFF TO ASK CERTAIN QUESTIONS EVEN WHAT NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE OF. THEY BASICALLY THOUGHT THE COMMISSION TO WANT THE INFORMATION BASED ON EXPERIENCES HEARING THEME THEM ASK QUESTIONS THAT HEARINGS. ALL OF THESE ACTIONS I THINK MAY HAVE BEEN DONE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS BUT NO ONE CONSIDER THE FACT THEY CONSTITUTED AN EQUAL TREATMENT IN COST APPLICANTS TO HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES WITH THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD TO NOT ONLY OPPRESS UPON OUR STAFF BUT UPPER MANAGEMENT AS WELL INCLUDING MYSELF. WHEN AN OCCASION ARISES WHERE WE MAY WANT TO TREAT ENOUGH APPLICANT FAIRLY UNFAIR DIFFERENTLY ALRIGHT FOR WHATEVER REASON. THE FIRST QUESTION WE ALWAYS ASK IS WHAT IS THE POLICY SAY. DEFAULTING TO POLICY RESULTS IN CONSISTENCY AND ELIMINATES DIFFERENT TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE STRESS IN CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ON A DAILY BASIS. FINALLY THE UDITOR INDICATED THAT IT HAD TROUBLE VERIFYING INFORMATION DURING THE AUDIT BECAUSE OF ARE INSUFFICIENT RECORDS RETENTION POLICIES. WE HAVE ADDRESSES AS WELL NOT ONLY REVISING AND IMPROVING POLICIES THE DEFINING THESE TASKS TO STAFF TO ENSURE THAT ALL FILES CONTAIN CERTAIN INFORMATION AND THAT CERTAIN DOCUMENTS ARE SCANNED AND RETAINED. AS WITH SOME OTHER ISSUES WE'RE FINDING THAT WE HAVE ANY FOR SOME SUPPORT STAFF WHO CAN ROUTINELY CONDUCT THIS TYPE OF WORK SO THE ANALYSTS CAN. CONCENTRATE ON THEIR INVESTIGATIOS. WHICH WILL THEN ULTIMATELY HELP US REACH OUR HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY GOAL. IN THE FUTURE WE PLAN TO REQUEST RESOURCES TO HIRE SUCH CLERICAL POSITIONS. AND JUST WENT OUT TO IN TERMS OF COLLECTING INFORMATION WE FOUND THE PROVIDING INFORMATION THE AUDITOR WAS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF OUR- KIND OF ARCHAIC. MISSING INFORMATION SYSTEM WHICH WE SHARE WITH THE COMMISSION. HOPING TO THE FUTURE THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO WRITE CODES AND SCRIPT TO. YOU KNOW PULL THAT INFORMATION OUT AND THEN PUT THE MANUALLY AND SPREAD SHEETS THAT WILL HAVE A SYSTEM THE WE CAN PROVIDE ALL THE DATA THAT PEOPLE ASK FOR I AM IN AN INSTANT. IT WOULD HELP US TO WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH TIME ANALYSTS SHOULD SPEND IN DIFFERENT PLACES. SO I WILL CONCLUDE SO WE CAN. TALK TO THE COMMISSION BUT GOING THROUGH THE AUTO SAY WAS NOT AN EASY TASK. AND WHILE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT YOUR AGENCY. HAS REALLY TRY TO EMBRACE ALL THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE AUDITOR. WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS ON REVIEWING OUR PROCESSES. AND CREATING OR REVISING OUR POLICIES. AND WE REALIZE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE AN ONGOING PROCESS. AND WE RECOGNIZE WE DO STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP. MOVING FORWARD. OKAY THAT. ANSWER QUESTIONS. AWFULLY COULD SEE THAT IS CONSTRUCTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS AS- ABSOLUTELY IT'S GOING TO MOVE TO MISS BAXTER PLEASE YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SALAS GERMAN DODD CHAIRMAN GREAT AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY I'M STATE FEELING A BAXTER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA GIMLI CONTROL COMMISSION AT THE OUTSET I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT THE COMMISSION AND THE BUREAU SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING THE STATE'S GAM GAMING ESTABLISHMENTS THE COMMISSION SETS POLICY INCREASE STANDARDS FOR THE REGULATED COMMUNITY MAKES IT ABILITY TO TERMINATIONS FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LICENSES FINDINGS OF SUITABILITY. REGISTRATION IMPROVEMENTS AND ACTS AS A DECISION MAKER AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS THE COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT ONLY PEOPLE OF GOOD CHARACTER HONESTY AND INTEGRITY OPERATE WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S CONTROLLED GAMING INDUSTRY AS IT RELATES TO THE CARTOONS AND TRIBAL CASINOS CARDROOM IN PLACE AND VENDORS BEARING THIS IN MIND I WILL BE LIMITING. MY COMMENTS TO THE AUDIT FINDINGS ARE RELEVANT TO THE COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION WORK CLOSELY WITH AUDIT TEAM AND COOPERATE COOPERATED FULLY WITH THEIR EFFORTS WE APPRECIATED THEIR HARD WORK AND DILIGENCE AND BELIEVE THAT THE RESULT IS A REPORT IDENTIFYING AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT WHICH THE COMMISSION WAS ALREADY WORKING TO CORRECT. BUT ALSO BROUGHT TO LIGHT SOME NEW ISSUES. IN BOTH CASES WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES OF THE FIVE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT RELATED TO THE COMMISSION TO ARE COMPLETED AND THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED. WHILE THE OTHERS ARE IN PROGRESS AND OR REQUIRE CHANGE TO EXISTING STATUTES. FIRST THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMMISSION IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES AND A METHOD TO TRACK THE NUMBER OF LICENSE APPLICATIONS. RECEIVED EACH FISCAL YEAR AND THE OUTCOME OF THOSE APPLICATIONS. THIS RECOMMENDATION WAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN JUNE OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND OUR STAFF IS NOW WORKING AS STATED EARLIER TO ADD THIS DATA FOR PAST APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION TO CAPTURING IT FOR ALL CURRENT APPLICATIONS SIR AGAIN THIS RECOMMENDATION IS COMPLETED. THE AUDIT RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD FOLLOWING THE NECESSARY STATUTORY CHANGES REVISE ITS REGULATIONS TO ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO MAKE FINAL APPROVALS OR DENIALS OF APPLICATIONS OUT ITS REGULAR MEETING RATHER THAN SCHEDULING A SEPARATE EVIDENTIARY HEARING. UNLESS AN APPLICANT REQUESTS AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. AS NOTED IN THE REPORT SUCH A CHANGE WOULD CONFLICT WITH THE EXISTING STATUTE COVERING THE COMMISSION'S HEARING PROCESS. THEREFORE THE COMMISSION'S REVOTE REVIEWING POTENTIAL CHANGES TO APPROPRIATE STATUTES FOR CONSIDERATION DURING THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL SESSION. THE I ALSO PROPOSE THAT THE COMMISSION CONDUCT A COST ANALYSIS OF THEIR WORKLOAD AND FEES. IN ORDER TO BETTER REFLECT THEIR ACTUAL COST THE COMMISSION IS CONDUCTING LIKE WORKLOAD IN COST ANALYSIS AND HAS REQUESTED THE SAME INFORMATION FROM THE BUREAU. IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION CONTRACT CONTRACTED WITH A VENDOR TO ASSIST WITH THE ANALYSIS. POSE A REVISED FEE STRUCTURE AND DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL INDUSTRY IMPACT OF THE PROS FEE STRUCTURE. THE COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE ITS BEST BEST EFFORTS TO MEET THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO HAVE THE WORKLOAD AND COST ANALYSIS COMPLETED BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY. THE AUDIT REPORT RECOMMENDED REVISING THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT APPLICATION PROCESSES AND TIME FRAMES ARE INCONSISTENT ACROSS LICENSE TYPES. THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN SUCH A PROCESS SINCE PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF THIS AUDIT AND HAS COMPLETED PROPOSED CHANGES TO ITS LICENSING REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS SUCH INCONSISTENCIES. THIS PAST MONDAY THE COMMISSION HELD A VERY PRODUCTIVE PUBLIC WORKSHOP ON THE PROPOSED REGULATORY CHANGES AT THAT WORKSHOP THE COMMISSIONERS APPROVE THE PACKAGE. WITH MODIFICATIONS TO MOVE FORWARD AND BE FORMALLY NOTICE WITH THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. WHILE THE COMMISSION HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE IT CAN AND- FORMALLY NOTICE IT BEFORE THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW SUCH AS MODIFYING THE PACKAGES AS DISCUSSED ON MONDAY. AND SURVEYING THE INDUSTRY AND THE BUREAU FAMILY CONTROL FOR THE PROJECTED FISCAL IMPACT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS MEETING THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDED TIMELINE OF SUBMITTING A REGULATORY PACKAGE TO THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW BY MAY TWENTY TEN. TWENTY TWENTY SORRY IN ADDITION TO THE AUDIT FINDINGS ON THE INCONSISTENCIES AMONGST LICENSE TYPE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW IT CONCERNED THE AUDIT WAS REQUESTED TO AND DID SS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALL APPLICANTS ARE TREATED THE SAME DESPITE THEIR RACE NATIONAL ORIGIN OR GENDER PARTICULARLY ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER APPLICANTS WHILE THE AUDITOR'S. AUDITOR'S DID FIND INCONSISTENCIES IN THE LICENSING PROCESS AMONGST LICENSE TYPE IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH THAT THESE INCONSISTENCIES WERE BASED ON PROCEDURAL DIFFERENCES SUCH AS PROCESSING TIME LINES OR THE COST CHARGE TO THOSE APPLICANTS THE AUDITOR'S DID NOT FIND ANY DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF A NEST ETHNICITY OR OTHER RELATED CHARACTERISTICS AS STATED PREVIOUSLY THE COMMISSION FINDS AN INDIVIDUAL'S ETHNICITY NATIONAL ORIGIN. GENDER OR ANY OTHER PROTECTED CLASS TO HAVE NO RELEVANCE IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL IS A PERSON OF GOOD CHARACTER HONESTY OR INTEGRITY. FINALLY THE AUDIT PROPOSED THAT THE COMMISSION ESTABLISH A FORMAL PROTOCOL FOR INFORMING APPLICANTS HOW TO WITHDRAW A REQUEST FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. AND GUIDANCE FOR THE COMMISSION STOP IN DISCONTINUING THE HEARING PROCESS ONE SUCH A REQUEST IS MADE. IN APRIL OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE COMMISSION STRENGTHENED AND FORMALIZED ITS EXISTING PROTOCOLS ASSOCIATE WITH INFORMING APPLICANTS HOW TO WITHDRAW THE REQUEST FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. AND HOW TO PROCESS AND IS CONTINUING HEARING ONCE A REQUEST IS MADE. THIS RECOMMENDATION IS COMPLETE. ONCE AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUDITOR'S FOR THEIR FAIR THOROUGH YET VERY DILIGENT WORK I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS A. AND I'VE COME UP IN THE PREVIOUS WE JUST GOT IN A START OFF LET ME JUST ASK YOU TO THE STATE AUDITOR ME THE MASS OF YOUR OFFERS. A THE STATE AUDITOR MADE TENREC MADE RECOMMENDATIONS DIRECTLY TO THE FEAR OF JUST WONDERING HOW IS A BUREAU PRIORITIZING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND CAN YOU PLEASE. PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN THE REPORT RIGHT SO WE DID SUBMIT A SIXTY DAY RESPONSE AN UPDATE TO THE AUDITOR I THINK THAT THEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT THEM. AS THEY HAD MENTIONED WE ARE WORKING TO GET THEM SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CLARIFICATION WHAT WE DID IS TO FIRST LOOKED AT THE OTHER HAS SET CERTAIN TIME LINES IN THERE SO SOMEWHERE DUE JULY TWENTY NINETEEN FOR SOME DUE NOVEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEN IT GOES ON TO NEXT YEAR SO WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD COMPLETED ALL THOSE TASKS THAT WERE REQUIRED OF US. BY JULY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE CONTINUOUSLY NO IT'S GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME WORKING ON ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE'RE KIND OF IN. IN DIFFERENT STAGES SOME EVEN THE COMPLETED ONES WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING A WORKING ON BUT ALL OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD SAY THAT WE DIDN'T DISAGREE WITH ANY OF THEM AND WE'RE WORKING ON. YELL IMPLEMENTING THEM ALL SOME OF THEM JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN OTHER. WORKING ON RESOLVING EACH DOES ISSUES WITH IN A TIMELY. AT TIMES IT SOUNDS LIKE CORRECT LIKE FOR INSTANCE THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE STRATEGIC PLAN MAKE SURE WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THAT BACKLOG TAKING CARE OF SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DOING. SO. WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THAT RIGHT NOW WE- HAVE A PLAN TO THE DOCTOR. APPLICATIONS YOU KNOW THE AUDITOR FOUND THE CARD ROOMS UNITS OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY DECREASED EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER OF STAFF IN THE UNITS. DOUBLED YOU CAN MENTION IT IN YOUR TESTIMONY BUT JUST WANTED TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THANK FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE PEOPLE WATCHING. YOU KNOW ANYTIME YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF STAFF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU WOULD THINK THE BACKLOG WOULD DECREASE NOT. INCREASE. RIGHT I THINK SOME OF THAT AND I WASN'T HERE ALL THIS TIME SO JUST HAVE WE'VE BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS. AND I THINK THAT SOME OF IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH THE TYPE OF CASES THAT FOLKS ARE WORKING ON SOME TAKE MUCH LESS TIME THAN OTHERS THE THINGS LIKE FOR THE KHARTOUM OVER LICENSES IT CAN BE VERY LENGTHY. WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT BY MAKING SURE WE ARE GETTING EVERYTHING WITHIN THAT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME THAT IS THE GOAL. SO WE DO HAVE TO UPDATE ALL THE TIME ESTIMATES I WISH I HAD AT. AT YOU KNOW JUST A VERY CLEAR RESPONSE ON WHY THAT IS I THINK WE JUST RECOGNIZE IT AND REALIZE THAT WE HAVE TO UPDATE OUR INFORMATION AND MAKE SURE THEY WERE KEEPING TRACK OF EVERYTHING. IN HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE TO MEET THOSE TIME LINES CURRY. THAT'S WHAT THE AUDIT IS KIND OF POINT OUT THAT MAYBE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TRACKING OR MAYBE IT'S A CHECKLIST. BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE THE FIGURES THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS YOU KNOW WHEN 70% OF THE CASES AREN'T EVEN MEETING THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY D. THRESHOLD. YOU HAVE TO ASK YOUR YOURSELF WHY IS THAT. AND WHAT IS THE BUREAU DONE TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THAT ISSUE AND ONE I THINK UNDER US. UNDER A STATUTE YOU HAVE TO NOTIFY PEOPLE WHEN IS YOUR CASE GOING TO BE RESOLVED AND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING EITHER. SO HE COULD DRESS OF THAT PLACE SURE IT IS HAPPENING NOW THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS REGULATIONS ON WHEN WE HAVE TO NOTIFY APPLICANTS IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH THOSE. THOSE INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IT IS A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AS PRACTICABLE O THEY IT DOES LEAVE SOME. SOME ROOM IF WE NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW EVER GONNA TAKE LONGER TIME WE NEED TO LET THEM KNOW AND FRANKLY THAT WASN'T HAPPENING ALL THE TIME. SO IT IS HAPPENING NOW A WITH THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS HAVE TO STRESS TO WHEN WE WERE GENERALLY TAKING CASES FIRST AND MOVING THEM FORWARD. IT WAS WHEN THERE IS THAT BACKLOG THAT THOSE LAST ONES IN ARE ALWAYS GOING TO EXCEED A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS SO IT'S REALLY KIND% OF CATCHING UP TO. GET US WHERE WE NEED TO BE SO EVEN THE ONES COMING IN WE CAN FINISH RIGHT NOW IT WAS WE WERE WORKING ON THE ONCE YOU CAME IN BEFORE. AND SO THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS JUST KEPT LAPSING FOR ALL OF. THE CASES THAT CAME IN. AGAIN RECOGNIZING THAT THE WE HAVE TO. GET RID OF WHAT THE BACKLOG IS SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE PENDING WORKLOAD IN A TIMELY MANNER. SO HOW WOULD YOU ACCOUNT FOR HIM A LEGISLATURE MADE ALLOCATION SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE BACKLOG WE HIRED ADDITIONAL STAFF. BUT STILL NOT SEEING THE REDUCTION IN THAT BACKLOG WHY IS THAT. I DON'T HAVE A I DON'T HAVE AN EASY ANSWER FOR YOU I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHY DOES IT TAKE LONGER WAS AT THE TIME THAT CASES AGAIN WAS A TURN OVER ALL THOSE THINGS WE NEED TO CONSIDER TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE FOR GIVING US THOSE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS DEFINITELY NEED HEM BUT WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO WORK WITH WHAT WE HAVE AT THIS POINT AND NOT SEEKING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AT THIS POINT TRYING TO JUST GET THAT BACKLOG DOWN WITH THE WITH THE POSITIONS LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED US CORRECT YOU CAN SEE WHY THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO SEE SOME TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT COUSIN WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT. WITH SOME OF THE FIGURES LIKE FIGURE TEN ON PAGE FORTY WORK SHOWS. YOU KNOW. STAFF SPENDING 50% OF THEIR TIME ON NON BILLABLE. THINGS YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH ALL THAT TIME IF THEY'RE NOT REDUCING CASELOADS. AND THEY'RE NOT SPENDING HALF EVEN HALF THEIR TIME. ON THESE BILLABLE THREE ITEMS YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING. YEAH I WILL SAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE STAFF WORK ON OTHER THINGS LIKE PROJECTS OF WE NEED SOMETHING ANALYZE IF WE NEED SOMETHING. WE REALLY TRY. TO NOT DO THAT ANYMORE REALIZING SOME OF THE WORKLOAD HAS TO BE DONE IT'S REALLY FRANKLY DEFINE A LOT TO THE MANAGERS. AND PEOPLE KINDA LAUGH IF YOU'RE IN OUR OFFICE WE WILL SAY A WORD YOU KNOW WE WANT SOMEONE TO DO THAT IS A NON CASE TIME IS THAT HUMM BILLABLE TIME AND WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON. MAKING SURE WE WANT ANALYSTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL TO SIR TRYING NOT TO DIVERT THEIR TIME AWAY FROM THOSE INVESTIGATIONS REALIZING THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED THEIR ASSISTANCE WITH. THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. SO THAT'S WHY THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME LEVEL OF NON CASE TIME. WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THE COST AND HOW TO. MAKE SURE THE COST COVER OUR SERVICES THOSE ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHICH ONES ARE GOING TO BE COVERED BY THE INVESTIGATION FEES THE DEPOSITS. AND WHICH MAY NEED TO BE COVERED BY A DIFFERENT SOURCE I'M- A FEES BUT TRYING TO REALLY GET THAT INFORMATION DOWN SO WE CAN WORK WITH THE COMMISSION. TO YOU KNOW TO THE FEES ALIGNED PROPERLY. YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS ALL OF THIS BUT- SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ALIGN THE FEES. WITH THE REGULATORY COSTS BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE AS OUTLINED BY THE AUDITOR. HUGE DISCREPANCY IN THAT IN THAT DEPARTMENT SO WHAT'S A BUREAU DOING TO RECOMMEND TO IMPLEMENT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ALONG THE ALIGNMENT OF FEES. SO THIS IS KIND OF AN ONGOING PROCESS THERE ARE DOING WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION RIGHT NOW JUST. KIND OF DOING THE WHOLE. LOOK AT ALL OVER COST HOWEVER OVERHEAD ALL OVER A MINISTRY TO COST. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT NEEDS TO PAY FOR THE PAID FROM WHAT FUN. AND WITHIN THOSE FUNDS WHICH FEES ARE APPLICABLE. SO IT'S JUST AT THE RIGHT NOW WE'RE COLLECTING ALL THE INFORMATION I THINK IT'S AS THE AUDITOR. SAID IT'S HELPFUL TO IMPLEMENT A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS. SO WE CAN SEE SOME OF THOSE INCREASED EFFICIENCIES AND THEN HAVE SOME OF THE DATA. UPON WHICH TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S A GOOD TIME THAT THE- CASE NEEDS TO BE FINISHED HOW WHAT'S- THE TIME ESTIMATES. FOR INSTANCE HAVE TO BE UPDATED. BUT IT IS IT'S- IT IS LOOKING AT ALL OF THE COMMISSION AND THE GIRLS COST IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO. HOW TO CAPTURE THEM SO IT'S. IT'S AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A PROCESS AND THANK GOODNESS THEY HIRED A CONSULTANT TO ASSIST US WITH THAT. ENDEAVOR TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW REALLY ANNUAL FEES APPLICATION FEES INVESTIGATION COST HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR THE RIGHT THINGS. THE CITY THINK WE'LL SEE AN ALIGNMENT OF THOSE FEES OR- AN EXPLANATION OF HOW WE'RE DOING THAT BY THE END OF THIS AT THE END OF THIS YEAR DO YOU THINK BY MID. NEXT YEAR. TURN ANTICIPATED TIMELINE ON THAT I BELIEVE THE AUDITOR HAD. I THINK IT'S ON. JULY OF NEXT YEAR THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION NOW ON IT SO. WE'RE TRYING TO ACCELERATE THAT TIME PROCESS GETTING ALL THE INFORMATION TOGETHER WORKING WITH THE CONSULTANT. SO I MEAN WE'RE STARTING NOW. REALIZING THAT THE WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE THINGS AND SEE IF WE NEED TO UPDATE SOME OF OUR NUMBERS. SO WE'RE WORKING ON IT THANK YOU. YES COMMISSION TO OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS WERE YOU GUYS WITH THOSE AND- ANTICIPATED TIMELINES FOR ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THIS. AS STATED TWO OF THE FIVE OF THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMPLETED ALREADY. HIDE SO THE OTHER THREE. TO WE ARE WORKING ON. RIGHT NOW WE START WORKING ON THEM BEFORE THE AUDIT REPORT ACTUALLY CAME OUT AS A STEPHANIE MENTIONED. WE ARE WORKING ON THE COST IN FEET ANALYSIS. THE OTHER RECOMMENDATION IS THE CONSISTENCY OF THE LICENSE OF MONTHS LICENSE TYPES. AS STATED WE ALREADY HAD A REGULATORY PACKAGE THAT HAD GONE OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE HELD A WORKSHOP EARLIER THIS WEEK. IT IS MOVING ON TO THE FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS. OBVIOUSLY THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW HAS VERY SPECIFIC. GUIDELINES IN WHICH YOU MUST MEET. FOR STATE COLOR NOTIFICATION. GATHERING FISCAL IMPACT SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT WE ARE ALREADY WORKING ON THAT PROCESS. THE THIRD. RECOMMENDATION IS THE STATUTORY CHANGE. SO WE WILL HAVE TO PROPOSE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO THOSE APPLICABLE STATUTES. DURING THE APPROPRIATE TIME. CORRECT AND DO YOU GUYS HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THE STATE OUT OF A RECOMMENDED. THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD AMEND THE GAMBLING GAMBLING ACT TO ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO TAKE ACTION ON ITS REGULATORY. WHAT'S AS REGULAR LICENSING MEETINGS RATHER THAN REQUIRING. EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS DC. THAT AS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT WE DO WE SUPPORT THAT RECOMMENDATION. OBVIOUSLY IT'S STILL IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMISSIONERS TO STILL HAVE THE OPTION TO ST APPLICANTS TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING IN THOSE CASES WHERE IT'S SIMPLY THAT MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED. AND MORE INFORMATION MIGHT BE BETTER OBTAIN THROUGH AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING PROCESS WHERE. THE DATE THE APPLICANT CAN HAVE THEIR DUE PROCESS. BRING WITNESSES BE SUBJECT TO CROSS EXAMINATION PROVIDE TESTIMONY UNDER OATH HAS SO AS LONG AS THE COMMISSION STILL HAS THAT ABILITY WHICH I BELIEVE WAS THE AUDITOR'S INTENDED AS WELL. BUT IT IT. IT WOULD ALLOW FOR THOSE APPLICANTS THAT DO NOT WANT TO BE PART OF THE EVIDENTIARY HEARING PROCESS IF THE ISSUANCE OF THE NILE WAS MADE. TO SIMPL FAST TRACK THAT TONIGHT RIGHT TO THE CORE TRYING TO LOOK AT IS TIME FRAMES AND HOW DO YOU REDUCES TIME FRAME TO GET MORE WORK DONE SOONER. GIVEN GIVEN THAT'S KIND OF THE GOAL OF USER ANOTHER WAY WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS OR IS THAT KIND OF. THE MESSAGES IS BY AMANDA LANG AMENDING THE ACT WELL I THINK THE OTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT THE ORDER HAD WITH REGARDS TO STRENGTHENING OUR WITHDRAWAL NOTIFICATION PROCESS. I THINK THAT THAT WILL ALSO HELP BECAUSE THAT PROVIDED THE APPLICANT EVEN MORE DETAIL AS TO HELD A WITHDRAWAL THEMSELVES FROM THAT PROCESS. SO WE MADE EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS JUST IMPLEMENTED IN APRIL OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THE EFFECT OF THAT PER SE BUT- HOPEFULLY. APPLICANTS THAT DO NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WILL ABIDE BY THOSE NOTIFICATIONS. TO THEM AND FOLLOWED THE PROCESS OF A DRAW. RIGHT TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT AND OUR STAFF AS WELL. I KNOW SO THEY'RE MORE LIKE HAS A QUESTION PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISS SHOULD NOT TO MISS BAXTER. WAS THE OUT OF FAIR. COMMENTS WHAT. SEEM TO INFER THAT THAT YOU WERE FINE WITH WITH WITH THE RECOMMENDATION. WELL SPEAK FOR HERS BUT YES I DO I BELIEVE THERE FAIR AGAIN WHEN I HAD MENTIONED THAT IT IT'S REALLY HARD TO TAKE IN IT WAS A LOT. OF TIME SPENT WITH THE AUDITORS BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS PROFESSIONAL AND COURTEOUS PLEASANT AND THEY HAD SOME GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS AND IT'S NOW UP TO US TO TAKE THOSE IMPLEMENT THEM AND- YOU KNOW COME UP WITH OUR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL TO MAKE THE PROCESS BETTER SO WE'RE ALL FOR IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES SO YEAH I WOULD SAY WAS FAIR. I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT THEY WERE VERY THOROUGH THEY LIKE TO ALL OF OUR POLICIES PROCEDURES THEY SPOKE TO INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND OUR PROCESSES. IT WAS EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION THROUGHOUT THEY REALLY GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE OUR SIDE OF THE STORY WHEN THEY HAD FINDING SO YES I BELIEVE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FAIR. SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT MIGHT BE THE REASON FOR A SLOW DOWN OR SO I I'M WONDERING HAS HAD HAVE YOU APPROVED SOMEONE. IN THIS PROCESS THAT TURNED OUT NOT TO MEET THE STANDARDS THAT WASN'T HONEST AND WASN'T. A PERSON OF GOOD CHARACTER AND YOU GO ALL WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. I CANNOT THINK OF A SPECIFIC CASEWHERE THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED. BROWSE THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IF THAT SCENARIO DID OCCUR THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE BUREAU GAMELY CONTROL TO REVIEW AT THE COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCE WHEN A SCENARIO LIKE THAT DOES OCCUR AND THEY'RE ABLE TO BRING FORTH AN ACCUSATION OR IDENTIFY. THE ISSUES OF CONCERN THROUGH THE RENEWAL PROCESS AT WHICH TIME THE COMMISSIONERS WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE FINDINGS AND CONSIDER THEM AT THAT PARK. SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS IT. AN ANALYSIS PARALYSIS OR. BECAUSE BECAUSE THIS THIS IS THIS THIS REPORT. SEEMS TO IMPLY A SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT FAILURE AND IT SEEMS AS IF THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS THAT. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING IT'S BEEN A SLOW PROCESS AND NOW THE NUMBERS ARE. RATHER. FRUSTRATING TO SEE THE PERCENTAGES OF HOW MUCH OF THOSE THAT HAVE APPLIED IT TAKEN MORE THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AND WE'RE TALKING SOME SIX YEARS SO I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IF YOU WERE TO SAY THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE AND HERE'S IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND THIS IS WHAT I WOULD DO TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS. THEY ALL TAKE THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS FROM STACY IS INSIDE IS A WITH THE BUREAUS WE ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THOSE TIME LINES AND JUST TO CLARIFY THE BUREAU MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMISSION. WHO THEN MAKES DECISIONS BUT LIKE SAYS HE SAID THAT WE ARE THE KIND OF THE FULL ENFORCEMENT ARM AFTERWARDS SO IF SOMEONE GETS LICENSED AND SOMETHING HAPPENS THEN WE CAN BRING FORWARD AN ACCUSATION TO REVOKE THAT LICENSE. IN TERMS OF I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S FRUSTRATING I TOTALLY AGREE. AND I JUST DON'T HAVE A M. ONE SPECIFIC ANSWER WHAT WHAT OCCURRED TO THAT. KIND OF GOT US IN THIS PLACE WERE TRYING TO KEEP CATCHING UP I THINK THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE IT WITHIN US TO MEET THOSE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TIME FRAMES ONCE WE GET RID OF THE BACKLOG AND WE'RE JUST DEALING WITH THE PENDING CASES THAT COME AND- GET THEM DONE IN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. AGAIN SOME OF THE LICENSING OWNER ONES MAY TAKE A LONGER TIME BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE MAJORITY OF THEM WE CAN GET THAT DONE IT'S JUST GETTING RID OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET RID OF THAT BACKLOG SO WE CAN THEN JUST CONCENTRATE ON ALWAYS MAINTAINING THAT. WITH THE PENDING APPLICATIONS. SO I WE HEAR YOU AND UNDERSTAND THAT BUT- SO WHEN YOU GET AN APPLICATION YOU SHOULD SAY RIGHT AWAY AS A MANAGER OKAY THIS IS GONNA TAKE FORTY HOURS. SO THAT'S ONE WEEK OF A PERSON FULL TIME. IT'S SO THAT YOU CAN BUDGET HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS AND YOU'RE RUNNING ONE OF THE LARGEST LAW FIRMS IN THE STATE RIGHT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE YOU. ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO TIME IN BILLING YOU KNOW HOW TO THE SIGN WORKLOADS SO I'M I'M WONDER FOR MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT. WHY WHY ISN'T THAT WHY DOES THAT SEEM TO BE WORKING RIGHT AND SO MAYBE TO PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION ON HOW WE CAN DISTRIBUTE THE CASES SO IT'S NOT A CASE COMES IN AND THEN THAN AN ANALYST WORKS UNTIL IT'S DONE THEY USUALLY GET SEVERAL CASES BECAUSE ARE IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF REVIEW THE REQUESTING DATABASE CHECKS OR WAITING FOR THE INFORMATION WHEN THEY GET THE APPLICATIONS THEY SOMETIMES HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT SO THEY'RE WAITING FOR INFORMATION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CHANGES BEFORE THEY WOULD JUST BASICALLY CONCENTRATE ON THE ONE LICENSE TYPE WE REALIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME DOWNTIME IN BETWEEN WHEN THEY'RE WAITING FOR THINGS SO NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING OR HAVING NON CASE TIME THEY'RE PICKING UP OTHER TYPES OF CASES MAYBE A FIVE CARD IN ORDER LICENSE WHICH TAKES LONGER THEY CAN PICK UP WORK PERMITS THEY CAN PICK UP THIRD PARTY PLAYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR BILLING ALL THAT THEY CAN'T AND KEEPING TRACK SO AND THAT'S WHEN YOU MENTION THE FORTY HOURS WHAT WE ARE DOING IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE TIME ESTIMATES FOR WHAT KINDS OF CASES. BEARING IN MIND THAT THESE CASES DO VERY BECAUSE SOME CAN BE VERY QUICK SOMEONE IS EASY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES SOME OF THEM HAVE A LOT AND TAKES A LOT LONGER TIME BUT TRYING TO MAYBE TEAR THOSE AND FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES TAKE LONGER. HOW MUCH TIME WE CAN ALLOCATE. TO THEN. REALLY BE ABLE TO MONITOR THE ANALYSTS. TO SEE LIKE IF YOU'RE REALLY TAKING TOO MUCH TIME FOR THIS OR THIS TYPE OF CASE. SO IT'S A IT'S A CONSTANT THEY HAVE A LOT OF CASES THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING IN AND OUT. AND AGAIN WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THEIR TIME NOW SPENT WORKING ON THOSE INVESTIGATIONS AND NOT HAVING ANY DOWNTIME. SO MY PRACTICE DAYS IT WAS CLOSURE I MEAN I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE BUILDING A CLIENTELE I'D FINISHED THE ENGAGEMENT RIGHT. UNLESS IT WAS LONG ENOUGH THAT I COULD DO PROGRESS BUILDINGS BUT- HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE CLOSURE I. I GUESS TO CLOSE. MISTER CHAIR I LOOK AT YOUR WEBSITES. AND I TRIED YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATORS HELPED ME GET UP TO SPEED YOU KNOW SO FOR THE- BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL. I FOUND I FOUND NO REALISTIC BUSINESS PLAN I FOUND NO BUDGET I FOUND NO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AYE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO WHAT YOU DO AND HOW YOU PAY FOR IT. AND THE AYE AYE I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. TO HELP ME MAKE ANY DECISIONS AND PREPARING FOR TODAY. FOR THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION. I SAW A STRATEGIC PLAN BUT I WOULD I. WOULD HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING. I JUST. IT COULD BE BETTER TO BE A LOT BETTER AND YOU NEED TO START PROVIDING METRICS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO HOW DO WE DO IT HOW DO WE GET IT DONE. AND I THINK. THERE'S A ROOM THERE. FOR IMPROVEMENT. I THINK. I DON'T WANT TO ASK YOU ALL THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED OF THE AUTHOR. CONTROLLER BUT I JUST I JUST WANNA KNOW MAYBE FOR AS A CLOSER. WHERE IS THE LEADERSHIP. WHO TAKES THIS. BY THE HORNS IS IT. MISTER SERRA OR IS IT. THE TWO OF YOU OR YEAH I THINK THAT FALLS WITH ME IN TERMS OF THE BUREAU BUT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM AND FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WE DO SO I TAKE THAT REALLY SERIOUSLY AND I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING A POLICIES LOOKING AT NUMBERS A KIND OF OBSESSED OVER THEM NOW. SO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE GOING TO GET THE WORK DONE AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN YOU KNOW. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN BE PROUD OF THE WORK HAT WE DO IN THERE GETTING IT OUT ON TIME SO I THINK THAT THAT RESPONSIBILITY FALLS WITH ME FOR THE BUREAU SITE. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS. INTERESTING ENVIRONMENT. I THANK YOU MISTER. THANK CENTER WITH THIS TIME ALL MOVED TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. THAN TO SOMEONE PATTERSON AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. SOMEONE NUMBER COOPER PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANKS FOR BEING HERE. QUESTION EARLIER I ASKED FOR THE PANEL. THIS IS A TRAINING ISSUE. WITH SOME OF YOUR FOLKS I MEAN THE ANALYST WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR WORK FORCES ANALYST'S VERSES. ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THAT WE HAVE WITH US TWO HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE IN THE BUREAU FORTY SEVEN ARE SWORN OFFICERS. THEY'RE NOT ALL FILLED BUT WE DO HAVE FORTY SEVENS MORE POSITIONS. ARE LICENSING ANALYSTS I BELIEVE ARE ARE LYSINE STAFF IS A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED. THE STAFF TO CONDUCT THE KIND OF INVESTIGATIONS OF THE AUDITOR'S LOOKED AT TOTAL FIFTY ONE. IS YOUR FORMAL TRAINING PROGRAM OVER THERE FOR YOUR FOLKS. YES I MEAN THERE'S DIFFERENT TRAINING FOR EVERYONE THERE IS WE DO HAVE A CALIFORNIA GELMAN INVESTIGATORS COURSE THAT. BASICALLY COVERS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DO THAT THE ANALYST. THE AGENTS THEY'LL ATTEND THE AUDITOR'S GO TO. A LOT OF IT. IS GETTING ONE SOME ONE ON ONE TRAINING SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME NON BILLABLE TIME WE DO HAVE OUR SENIOR ANALYST. WORKING WITH SOME OF THE JUNIOR ANALYSTS WHEN THEY COME ON BOARD TO. GET THEM UP TO SPEED IT'S NOT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT TAKES A BIT OF TIME TO GET UP TO SPEED WITH. AND WE TALK ABOUT HIRING PROCESS USUALLY TAKES LONGER FOR US TO WHAT WE HAVE TURNED OVER WE ARE IN THE DIVISION LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY DO GO. HAD KIND OF A PEACE OFFICER BACKGROUND CHECKS SO IT TAKES A FEW MONTHS SOMETIMES. SO ALWAYS TRYING TO. WHEN WE HAVE A- AN ANALYST LEAVE IT JUST TAKES LONGER TO FILL THEM. IN A WILL TAKE TIME TO TRAIN THEM HOW HIGHS YOU TURN OVER. RIGHT NOW IN THE- I'M NOT SURE THE TURNOVER RATE RIGHT NOW OUT OF THOSE FIFTY ONE POSITIONS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO THESE CASES. THERE ARE THREE VACANT POSITIONS. SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE PRETTY. PRETTY WELL STAFFED SERVER YOU PUT IN FOR BCP'S CORRECT. SORRY YOU PREFER BCP'S EVERY YEAR MORE OR LESS. GENERALLY FOR DIFFERENT POSITIONS THESE WORK STANDARD FOR TWO MORE YEARS THOSE FIFTY ONE POSITION SO WE ARE NOT SEEKING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND SEEN HOW MUCH WORK WE CAN. GET DONE AND RE EVALUATE ALL THE TIME ESTIMATES TO GET SOME BETTER METRICS TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW WHAT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF STAFFING IS SO WHAT IS YOUR OPINION WHY. MISTER BUCKLES OCCURRING WAS FAR AS THE BACKLOG IN CASES I MEAN WE'RE HERE TWO YEARS AGO THREE YEARS AGO WE GIVE YOU ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR YOUR SWORN OFFICERS SO. WHAT IS A BACKLOG CONTINUE. IN YOUR OPINION IN MY OPINION. I WISH I'D I DON'T HAVE A I DON'T HAVE AN EASY ANSWER I FEEL LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CAUSES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN THE YES FOR DIGITAL RESOURCES THREE YEARS AGO IN THIS COMMITTEE THE GAO COMMITTEE I SAT ON MY TALKED ABOUT IT IN RELATIONAL FUNDING FOR NATIONAL POSITIONS LÃ  MY QUESTION TO YOU TO YOU IS. WE GIVE YOU FUNDING WE GAVE POSITIONS SO WHY IS A BACKLOG CONTINUED. YOU'RE YOU'RE IN CHARGE THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU SO THAT'S WHY. I'M TRYING TO ASK THAT. GIVE YOU THE TOOLS YOU ASKED FOR SO WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER THAT YEAH I THINK AT THE TIME AGAIN WAS BEFORE MY TIME BUT I THINK THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF STAFFING TO GET THE JOB DONE AND AGAIN IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MAY NOT HAVE BEEN BUT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE KINDA IMPLEMENT ALL THOSE EFFICIENCIES AND FIGURE OUT IF THAT IS THE RIGHT. STAFFING NUMBER YOU GUYS ARE MAYBE NOT MAYBE I'VE HEARD YOU GUYS TO MY COLLEAGUES EACH CASE IS DIFFERENT OBVIOUSLY AND LONG FOR STILL BERKELEY CASEY MAY BE. A TWENTY MINUTE REPORT MAY BE A FOR OUR REPORT RIGHT DIPPING THE COMPLEXITIES OF THAT YOU GUYS HAVE A REALLY ADDRESS THAT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW A CASE IS NOT A CASE YOU CAN'T MISS IT OKAY HERE'S A CASE APPLICATION TO TAKE FOUR HOURS. BECAUSE OF PEOPLE'S BACKGROUNDS A LOT. OF OTHER ISSUES. SO. I GO ONCE YOU MOVE THE BACKLOG BE PROCESS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. EXCEPT FOR SOME EXTREMELY COMPLICATED CASES. SO WHAT WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR DISNEY BACKLOGS IN WHEN. THE TWO MORE YEARS OR SO WE WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE SAYS IT'S THOSE TWO YEARS SO OUR STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SUBMITTED TO THE AUDITOR. FOR KIND OF KNOWING THAT WE HAVE FUNDING FOR THOSE FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL I BELIEVE IT WAS THIRTY TWO POSITIONS THAT WE GOT. AND SO I'M KIND OF WORKING BACKWARDS FROM THAT TO SEE HOW WE CAN GET RID OF THAT BACKLOG. I THINK THAT ONCE WE GET ALL OF OUR DAD IN PLACE TO HAE A BETTER IDEA OF. ON SHE HAVEN'T BASED ON NUMBERS TO TELL YOU THAT WHAT WE THINK IS REASONABLE IN TERMS OF ELIMINATING. THE BACKLOG. I FEEL LIKE THAT'S KIND OF PART OF WHAT THE AUDITOR WANTED. TO DO TO IMPLEMENT SOME THINGS THAT TAKE A HARD LOOK AT OUR NUMBERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH SOME REALISTIC. YOU KNOW PROJECTIONS ON WHEN WE CAN GET IT DONE. FOR JOHN AGO. THE AUDIT JUST IN THE BILLING RECORDS. THE OTHER THREE OR SCOPE. THE TROUBLE WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE IMPROPERLY BUILT. ARE YOU GUYS PLAN ON GOING FOR THAT MATTER STOPPING AT THAT. I WASN'T I DIDN'T CATCH THAT THE SO DOES THE BUREAU PLAN A REVIEWER AUDIT IS BILLING RECORDS YEARS BEYOND THE THREE YEAR FISCAL SCOPE OF THE STATE AUDIT. ARE YOUR FOR INTO THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND CORRECT DOES YES WE COULD ONLY GO BACK THREE YEARS SO WE WENT BACK BEFORE THE AUDITOR'S CAME AND WE HAD RECOGNIZE THAT WERE ALREADY STARTING TO IMPLEMENT THAT. THOSE PROCEDURES TO DO THAT RECONCILIATION KNOWING THAT AS WAS DAUGHTERS OFFICE EXPLAINED THAT WE DO HAVE FOLKS. AGENTS IN CERTAIN POSITION NUMBERS FUNDED BY DIFFERENT FUNDS THEY DO WORK ON BOTH CARDROOM IN TRIBAL IT WILL GO BACK AND FORTH IT MAY FLUCTUATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO WE REALIZE THAT WE NEED TO JUST KEEP TRACK OF INDIVIDUALS AND SO NEVER TRACKING. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE TIME THAT THEY'RE SPENDING IN A PLACE. THAT HER POSITION ISN'T FUNDED FOR THAT WERE PUTTING THAT MONEY BACK WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. SO WE HAD STARTED THAT PROCESS IN THE AUDITOR'S NOTICED IT TOO SO WE HAD GONE BACK AND- DONE THOSE THREE YEARS SO THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS. OF THE MONEY WAS TRANSFERRED OVER INTO MY VERY FROM YEAR TO YEAR IT COULD BE THAT STF POSITIONS ARE SPENDING MORE TIME IN CARDS CARTER POSITIONS ARE MUCH. SO WE HAVE TO THERE WAS NO EASY WAY TO DO IT IT SEEMS LIKE WE JUST NEEDED TO TRACK EVERY SINGLE PERSON AGENTS TIME. ALRIGHT AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT WHERE THE COST LAYS THE NOTE THE AUDITOR'S REPORT YOU HAVE A PATHWAY. TO GO FORWARD CORRECT AND REDUCES BACKLOG BUT I'M STILL GOING BACK TO THAT POINT WHERE YOU RECEIVE THOSE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. TWO YEARS AGO HOW MANY WAS IT THREE YEARS AGO. I THINK THERE WAS I BELIEVE IT WAS TWENTY EIGHT WAS THE LAST. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PROVIDE THOSE TWENTY POSITIONS BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD COMPLAINTS FROM YOUR AGENCY. ABOUT STAFF AS WE GIVE YOU TWENTY POSITIONS. AN HOUR YOU GET A THIRTY TWO MORE SO I'M SEEING WHAT CONFIDENCE SHOULD I HAVE. THAT WE GOT A SWEET POSITIONS. YOU GUYS. DIDN'T REDUCE THE BACKLOG. SO WHY SELF CONFIDENCE HE NOW THAT YOU REDUCE THE BACKLOG RIGHT JUST TO CLARIFY SO WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY NEW POSITIONS THE TWENTY AS PART OF THE THIRTY TWO THAT WE FOR SECRET RIGHT WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH THEM. KIND OF OUR MEANS WHICH YOU PROVIDED TO US IN THE CONFIDENCE I THINK HOPEFULLY WILL COME WHEN YOU SEE OUR PLAN AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT EACH CASE AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO. REDUCE THE BACKLOG IN THEM. HAPPY DISCUSS THAT WHEN WE GET THOSE DONE A WE ARE WORKING HARD ON GETTING THOSE NUMBERS IN PLACE SO WE CAN HAVE AGAIN. WE WANT TO I'M NOT MORE THAN ONE FOR THE BACK LIKE TO GO AWAY BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE A REALISTIC AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ARE JOB THOROUGHLY. AND THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY. DELIVER ON WHAT WE WHAT WE SAY WE ARE. YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT I WANT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON. I'D LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS ESENTIALLY THE DESCRIPTORS OF THIS AUDIT BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT. DELAYS INCONSISTENCIES BACKLOGS. AN APPEARANCE OF UNFAIR TREATMENT AND THE POTENTIAL FOR BIAS. DO YOU. ACCEPT AND UNDERSTAND THIS AUDIT SHE EIGHT ITS FINDINGS AND WILL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AFFECT THE CHANGES RECOMMENDED IN THE AUDIT. I CAN SPEAK FIRST SO YES I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THEM IT WAS WHAT I WILL SAY SOME OF THOSE WORDS THE DESCRIPTORS THAT YOU HAD ISSUE MENTIONED WE'RE FIRST READING THROUGH IT YEAH IT WAS VERY IT WAS JUST GAVE THE AUDIT THAT WE WERE YOU KNOW IT'S IS DISTURBING TO READ AND IT'S EMBARRASSING. HOWEVER ONCE WE READ IT AND WHAT THOSE INCONSISTENCIES IN WHAT THE IT THE APPEARANCE OF AN FOR TREATMENT CONSISTED OF WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE THINGS THERE ARE THINGS THAT IN OUR PROCEDURES AND OUR PROCESSES THAT WE COULD ADDRESS AND ELIMINATE THEM SO WE ARE DOING THOSE IMMEDIATELY NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE AUTO BUT IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS THERE WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE AUDITOR LAID IT ALL OUT. FOR US. AND WE CAN START ADDRESSING THOSE SO WE HAVE. DO YOU FULLY APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND THE. AUDIT CONCLUSION. THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU HANDLE FUNDS OF THE OF THE FEES OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO PAY FOR YOUR- OPERATION. THAT YOU ARE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO AN UNLAWFUL TAX. AT LISTENING TO WHAT THE AUTHOR DESCRIBED I DO UNDERSTAND I GET THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEES AND TAXES AND I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT THE COMMISSION AND THE BUREAU'S WORKING TOGETHER TO AGAIN A LINE THOSE COST AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE COVERING FEES COVERING FEES COVERING THINGS BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO. I'M AND WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE BUCKETS WORDS WHERE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SERVICES SHOULD FALL INTO AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE FEE IS PAYING FOR THEM SO WE DON'T RUN. ANYWHERE CLOSE TO YOU KNOW AN ILLEGAL TAXES ENGINE. THAT. TO ME THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FEE AND- THEY TAX IS THE DIRECT NEXUS BETWEEN THOSE WHO PAY. AND THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE. DO YOU NOT. CONCUR THAT SIGNIFICANT FEES PAID FOR PROCESSES THAT TAKE OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. OUR CALLS INTO QUESTION THE NEXUS BETWEEN A FEE PAID BY AN APPLICANT AND YOUR ABILITY TO PERFORM. UP ON A TIMELY APPROVAL. SO THIS GETS TO MY DUE PROCESS QUESTION. SO THE NEXUS WE'RE LOOKING AT KIND OF SEPARATELY JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FEES SO WE CHARGE FOR INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THOSE ARE COVERED ALL INVESTIGATION BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE ANY OF THESE APPLICATION FEES AT THOSE ARE BEING DETERMINED BASED ON CERTAIN SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE IN THOSE ARE GOING TO COVER THOSE COSTS. CERTAINLY THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS I FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF A SEPARATE MATTER IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO. TO COMPLY WITH THAT BECAUSE I MEAN IT'S REQUIRED OF US OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP INDUSTRY WAITING THAT LONG WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY GET IMPATIENT. RIGHTFULLY SO AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS MATTER OF CATCH UP SO WE'RE REALLY GOING TO JUST. REALLY TRYING TO GET RID OF THAT BACKLOG SO WE CAN ALWAYS WE WON'T HAVE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ALL THE TIME ABOUT THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS BECAUSE WE ARE MEDIAN IT. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT. ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. THE STANDARD FOR PERFORMANCE AS A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. HI I ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S SORT OF ARBITRARY THAT IS A HALF A YEAR. WHY CAN'T YOU GET IT DONE IN NINETY DAYS. WHY CAN'T YOU GET WHAT I MEAN HONESTLY I'M I'M- ABOUT. MY PRIVATE LIFE FOR THIRTY YEARS WAS IN BROADCASTING WE WENT THROUGH THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. BACKGROUND CHECKS FEES ALL KINDS OF THINGS. AND QUITE FRANKLY THE FCC WAS MODERNIZED THE NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR COMMUNICATIONS ACT WAS NOT MODERNIZE TODAY. TODAY I CAN GET A LICENSE IN THIRTY DAYS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION WITH A THOROUGH BACKGROUND CHECK AND WITH STANDARDS OF UP FINANCE AND ALL OF THE THINGS NECESSARY I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT IN THIS. ARENA THAT THIRTY DAYS IS REALISTIC BUT CAN YOU CHALLENGE YOURSELF. AND BE WILLING TO MANAGE AN OPERATION. THAT CAN ACTUALLY GET THINGS DONE AND NINETY DAYS INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS WELL I WILL SAY THAT WERE THEN THE HUNDRED EIGHTIES COMES FROM REGULATIONS OF BANK STANLEY I WILL SAY THAT SOME MIGHT ACTUALLY THINK WE COULD GET IN THAT TIME FRAME IT'S JUST GOING TO DEPEND ON THE CASE SOME. SOME CASES LIKE WERE PERMITS TAKE A LOT LESS TIME THAN A CARD ROOM OWNERS CERTAINLY SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO WAIT TO THE HUNT USE THE ENTIRE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS SHOULD WE BE ABLE TO GET THOSE OUT SOONER ABSOLUTELY I WOULD LIKE TO GET THOSE OUT IMMEDIATELY. SO I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE GET IN COMPLIANCE WITH. AND I THINK THE FRUSTRATION HERE. IS TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE WORKING ON. THIS HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY. COMPLETION PROCESS AND THE MORE PEOPLE WE GIVE YOU THE SLOWER YOU ARE. THAT IS A VERY VERY CONCERNING. CRITICISM I THINK EVENT WHAT ONE FOR FINAL. I'M GONNA PUT MY MAYOR'S HAT BACK ON MAY FRESNO FOR. EIGHT YEARS DO YOU UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT THE DELAYS THAT YOU CREATE. AT AND THE OF DELAYS INCONSISTENCIES THE BACKLOGS THE APPEARANCE OF UNFAIRNESS. HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE GENERAL FUND OF. CITIES AND HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE EMPLOYABILITY OF LITERALLY HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY OF FAIRLY COMPLETING THE PROCESS. BECAUSE THE END RESULT IS SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES DO DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE A GATEKEEPER TO PROGRESS. I DO'S UNDERSTAND THAT. DOING THINGS FAIRLY IS IMPERATIVE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL CHANCE TO WORK ON AND IN THE INDUSTRY MOST OF OUR SEASON ME UP TO HELP ME OUT BUT A LOT OF THE FOLKS SAID WE THE COMING FOR LICENSURE ARE ABLE TO WORK PENDING FULL LICENSURE SO. I DON'TWANT YOU THINK THAT'S AN EXCUSE BECAUSE WE STILL WANT TO GET THAT DONE BUT WE ARE AWARE THAT AND MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT THOSE FOLKS CAN WORK WHAT DOESN'T WORK IS IF THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN WE DO AN INVESTIGATION AND SOMETHING COMES OUT DEROGATORY TO HAVE TO REMOVE THAT. SO THAT'S WHY I THINK MAKING SURE THAT WE DO THINGS TIMELY IS SO THAT PEOPLE ARE IF THEY SHOULD BE AN INDUSTRY THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE EXERCISE TENANTS CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME IDEA OF THE- RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE- HIGH. AMOUNTS OF PROCESSING AND APPLICANTS YOU HAVE AND THE ALL MY GOODNESS HERE'S A CROOK THAT NEEDS TO BE. TAKEN OUT OF THIS PROCESS IS IT A LOT. IS IT ROUTINE AND REGULAR. OR IS IT AN EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE. BECAUSE IT IS THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE FOCUSING. ON A MINORITY OF A PROBLEM THAT SLOWING DOWN A MAJORITY OF APPLICATIONS THAT'S MY BASIC CONCERN HOW. WIDE SPREAD IS THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL IT A CRICKET ELEMENT OR OF ON LICENSABLE ELEMENT. MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN JUST THE OPPOSITE. HARD WORKING PEOPLE IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA WITH VERY VERY GOOD OPERATIONS. WHO PAY THEIR TAXES TO THIS CITY DO IT RIGHT AND I ACTUALLY EXPAND. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. IT'S ONE THING FOR THE SAFETY THE LEGAL CONCERNS. BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ARE YOU MAJORING ON THE MINERS ARE MONITORING ON THE MAJORS YEAH AND I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE MAY AND MAKE THE COMMISSION MIGHT BUT IN TERMS OF OUR KIND OF DENIAL RECOMMENDATION RATE I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT SO I DON'T HAVE THE COMPARISON OF THE BUREAU'S TO NILE RECOMMENDATION BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS APPROXIMATELY 1% OF THE APPLICANTS THAT COME FORTH TO THE COMMISSION. ARE SENT TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING WHETHER THAT MEANS THE COMMISSION NEEDS MORE INFORMATION FO SUITABILITY OR AT THE END UP TO DIAL BUT LIKE STEPHANIE DID MENTION. ALL BUT THE OWNERS ARE ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE INDUSTRY WITHIN A VERY REASONABLE TIME FRAME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO WEEKS MAYBE A MONTH. AND BEGIN WORKING WITHIN THE INDUSTRY DURING THAT TIME OF THE BACKGROUND PROCESS. AND IF AN EXAMPLE OF AN APPLICANT IS SENT TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. THEY ARE ALSO ISSUED IN TERMS LICENSE. IN WHICH THEY CAN CONTINUE ON WORKING IN ONE IN THE INDUSTRY UNTIL FINAL TYSON IS STILL I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THIS IS 1% OF APPLICANTS ESSENTIALLY. ESSENTIALLY THAT IS A MINUSCULE NUMBER. AND YET IS TAKING YOU SIX MONTHS TO GET APPROVALS DONE. I MEAN I HONESTLY I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I MEAN HOW MUCH HOW DIFFICULT IS IT. TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS IF IN FACT YOU HAVE 1% THAT ARE FALLING INTO THE THIS DIFFICULT CATEGORY WHICH MEANS WHAT YOU HAVE 99% THAT ARE GENERALLY. APPROVAL BALL AND ABLE TO FIND THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY DOES IT TAKE YOU. OVER HALF A YEAR. TO PROCESS WHAT SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY ROUTINE. INFORMATION THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS AND HISTORIC CHECKS AND FINANCIAL CHECKS. I ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU FOR DEFAULTING ON THE SIDE OF SUSPICION. OP OR ARE YOU ARE OR ARE YOU WILLING TO CLEARLY AND CAREFULLY LOOK. AND QUICKLY APPROVE I'M TRYING TO ME THIS THIS IMPLICIT BIAS. BOTHERS ME BECAUSE I'M WONDERING IF THAT INSTITUTIONAL BIAS IS SO CONCERNED OVER THE 1% THAT YOU'RE PENALIZING THE 99% BUT THESE DELAYED. APPROVALS THAT'S A CONCERN BECAUSE YOU'RE PENALIZING CITIES AND YOU'RE PENALIZING HIM HONESTLY PLEASE AND YOU'RE PENALIZING GROSS AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT THAT'S A BIG CONCERN. FOR ME IN A MUCH BIGGER PICTURE THIS. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WE DO. LIKE YOU MENTIONED CAREFULLY REVIEW EACH OF THESE CASES AND WE AS YOU SHOULD RIGHT AND WE ALSO THERE ARE CERTAIN AND I THINK THE AUDITOR BROUGHT IT UP THAT TO BE CONSISTENT THAT WE ASK THE SAME TYPES OF QUESTIONS SO WE CHECKED THE SAME DATABASES AND SOME TAKE LONGER THAN OTHERS MIGHT AGAIN BUT YOU THINK THEY'LL TAKE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS SOME OF THAT CAN. HAPPEN ON A MORE ON IT. FOR BASIS BUT IT DEPENDS ON. I WAS AND I PUSH IT I DON'T I WANTED BUT- IF IN FACT. WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE THEN BOB BACKLOG SHOULD BE. REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY AND YOU SHOULD BE A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE NO BACK BACKLOGS THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. AND SO I I'M ASKING ON ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT. TO BE VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS AUDIT IT CHARTS A PATHWAY ARE THEN I THINK IT'S VERY VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AND PLEASE KEEP IN MIND. THE SAFETY AND THE LEGALITY OF THIS IS IMPORTANT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF PEOPLE PASSED THE TEST. GELMAN BUSINESSES AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A IS A PROBLEM WITH DUE PROCESS. THAT THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY PAY A FEE THEY ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME THEY SHOULD GET AN ANSWER. AB YOU YOU HAVE A PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THE ACTUAL DUE PROCESS. FEELS TO ME LIKE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT IS A GRADUAL PROCESS OF DENIAL NO DECISION OR DELAYED DECISION IS THE EFFECTIVE WITH THE NILE SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE- RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR AND IMPLEMENT THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I THINK IS A VERY. A LOT OF VERY GOOD THAT CAN HAPPEN THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES AND I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND- TAKING UP THAT CHALLENGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LITTLE BIT IN THE WEEDS HERE BUT I'M LOOKING AT A STATISTICAL ANOMALY. AND THAT'S KIND OF OUR JOB IS THE- CHECK ALL THE NUMBERS. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. YOU HAD ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR ABANDONED WITHDRAWN APPLICATIONS AND I LOOK AT THOSE AS- KIND OF A BUBBLING POT IT IS DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IS COOKING OFF. IN THE YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU ONLY HAD TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE ABANDONED WITHDRAWN APPLICATIONS THAT'S A 76% DROP SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE THERE WHAT HAPPENED IN IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT A BAD YEAR FOR YOU. BUT THAT MONSTER DROP WITH WHERE PEOPLE JUST NOT FRUSTRATED THAT YEAR OR WHAT WAS GOING ON. YEAH I APOLOGIZE I DO NOT KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I CAN CERTAINLY RESEARCH THAT AND GET THAT BACK TO YOU BUT I'M- LIKE. I DON'T I SPEAK OF I DON'T KNOW. RIGHT BUT FULL BY AYE AYE TO ADD TO THAT I MEAN THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE APPLICANT THE APPLICANT. OBVIOUSLY PUTS FORTH THEIR RECOMMENDATION FOR WITHDRAWAL OR ABANDONMENT. IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE EITHER CHANGING JOBS THERE ARE NO LONGER IN THAT PARTICULAR POSITION THAT'S MORE SPECIFIC TO THE APPLICANT ITSELF. OKAY UNDERSTOOD BUT IF I THROW OUT TO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE ANOMALY. I GET A THREE YEAR AVERAGE OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO PEOPLE ABANDONED WITHDRAWN APPLICATIONS IT'S A SEEMED VERY STRANGE TO ME SO IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO ME LATER ON. I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEW BELIEVE ARE NEXT QUESTION THE CLIENT WILL BE JUST ASK ANOTHER QUESTION HIS DIDN'T COME UP AND IT WAS SOMETHING MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL ON THAT WAS HE OFTEN DOES A BUREAU AT TRACK THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS SINCE THEY SAID THERE WAS NO LOGS NO RECORDS. SEEMS KIND OF ODD TO BE WHY THERE WOULD BE NO RECORD OF THAT SO THE AND ARE TALKING AND LEAVE WITH THE SPECIAL AGENTS DO SO THEY DO TRACK ALL THEIR TIME INTO TIME KEEPING SYSTEMS YOU KNOW ONE THAT TALKS ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY DO WITH THEIR CASES AND THEN JUST WHAT THEY DO ON A DAILY BASIS WHAT THE AUDITOR LE STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T CLEARLY LAID OUT HOW MUCH TIME THEY'RE SPENDING IN EACH CARDROOM TRIBAL CASINO. AND THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT THE SYSTEMS TRACK WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS ENSURING THAT ALL OF THE AGENTS. PLACE THERE WAS. PLACE THAT INFORMATION IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN. RUN HAVE TO MANUALLY PULL IT OUT I THINK IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD LIKE A SYSTEM OR WE COULD JUST PRESS THE BUTTON AND BE ABLE TO HAVE ALL THAT INFORMATION. RIGHT NOW WE JUST HAVE DIRECT THEM ALL TO YOU NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR WERE YOU WERE. SPECIFICALLY IN AND LAID OUT WHICH CARTER WHICH OF THIS YOU KNOW AND HOW MUCH TIME WAS SPENT THERE. AND THE REASON WHY OBVIOUSLY. BUT I THINK THAT WAS IT WAS WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO CHECK SPECIFICALLY FOR LOCATIONS IT WASN'T. CLEAR IN ALL CASES GOT IT SO THE BUREAU'S LOOKING AT. BRING SOME CLARITY OR SOME. TRANSPARENCY IN THE LONG RUN WE'RE KIND OF DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW JUST YOU. TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE IS CERTAINLY THE FUTURE WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SYSTEM OR WERE ABLE TO. GET THAT INFORMATION YOU KNOW. JUST WITH THE PUSH OF A BUTTON SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WORKING TOWARDS AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT. SO THAT'LL BE OF SOMETHING WILL SAVE WITH THE CHECK INS WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS. FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS DOUBLE TO BE EITHER UPDATED ON OUR EFFORTS THERE. AND THEN IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL TO THE A TALK ABOUT. IT AND IT CAME UP JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT- WANTED YOU TO. KIND OF EXPAND ON THE CHARGES THAT WERE BEING MADE TO THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FIVE BABY. CHARGED TO ANOTHER FIND. AND THIS KIND OF GOES BACK TO THE WHOLE NOTION OF THE ALIGNMENT OF FEES. WHY IS THAT OCCURRING BECAUSE AND YOU SEE SOME ACCOUNTS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FLUSH. AND IT IS TO BE LEADS TO A LOT OF CONFUSION OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE FEES AND HOW THEY'RE BEING ALIGNED WITH THE REGULATORY COSTS RIGHT SO I THINK IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF A TWO PART PROCESS PROBABLY FOR BUT THE COMMISSION AND THE BEER IN TERMS OF. THE ALLOCATIONS FROM THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND AND THEN THEY GET WE CONTROL FUN MAKING SURE THAT THOSE ARE ARE APPROPRIATE AND THEN LOOKING AT THE GALA CONTROL FUND AND WITHIN THEIR WHICH FEES RELATE TO WHICH SERVICES SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WHILE WE DO OUR COST ANALYSIS WE WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER AT NOT JUST WHAT TYPES OF FEES ARE BEING CHARGED FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THERE'S APPROPRIATE FUNDING AND SERVICES BETWEEN THE STF AND THE G. C. F. PLEASE JUST TO ADD TO THAT WITH REGARDS TO THE COMMISSION WE TRACK OUR WORKLOAD SPECIFICALLY TO. THE TYPE OF FUNCTION IN THE CATEGORY OF THAT FUNCTION WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A TRIBAL VERSUS CARD ROOM. OR THIRD PARTY WORKLOAD. AS WE DO HAVE A WORKLOAD DATABASE THAT IDENTIFIES THE PERCENTAGE SPLIT BETWEEN THE- STF AND THE CAN'T LIKE CONTROL FUN AND WHAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO CHARGE. OKAY YEAH I THINK THE YOU KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF. HARRY IS SOMEWHERE PATTERSON HAS A QUICK QUESTION VERY VAGUE I I'M CAPABLE OF A QUICK QUESTION I PROMISE. DO YOU INTEND TO LIFT THE MORATORIUM ANYTIME SOON AND ARE YOU CONCERNED WITH THE- CRITICISM THAT. THE AUDIT DISCOVERED WITH RESPECT TO WHAT LOOKS LIKE A MORATORIUM THAT IS INTRINSICALLY UNFAIR AND JUST TO CLARIFY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THEM AND MORE CHARMER WE TALKING ABOUT THE GAMES ISSUE THE GAME OR TORY IN THAT THAT IS REFERENCED IN THE AUDIT AND THAT WAS PRESENTED IN TESTIMONY RIGHT SO IT'S THE GAME THE APPLICATION ISSUE IN TERMS OF WHEN GAME APPLICATIONS COMMENDED BUREAU WAS REQUIRED AND RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THEM EITHER ISSUING APPROVALS ARE DENIALS SO THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER ISSUES THAT IT HELD SOME KIND OF EQUAL TREATMENT WE STARTED ISSUING THOSE SO AT THE END OF JULY WE I THINK WE SENT OUT A- TO TEMPORARY POOLS. TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE WHEN KERR PLAYING GAMES TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THOSE OTHER CARDROOM TO APPLY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THEM TO AND THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL GAMES WERE WORKING THROUGH THAT PROCESS. TO ADDRESS EACH OF THEM BUT I DON'T. PROVIDING IT BACK TO THE AUDITOR ON THAT BUT YES WE HAVE STARTED GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF ISSUING THOSE GADGETS IT IT SEEMS LIKE A MORATORIUM FREEZES IN PLACE INEQUITIES. AND THE AND THE SOONER YOU GET THROUGH THAT I MEAN IF ONE. APPLICANT GETS TO DO ACCENT ANOTHER GETS TO DO X. MINUS WHY THAT'S OF THAT'S- INTRINSICALLY UNFAIR. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU NEED TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE IS EQUAL BEFORE THE PROCESS. AT IS ADJUDICATED AND JUDGED UPON THAT FAIR PLAYING FIELD AND NOT UNNECESSARILY PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO FALL IN. THE MORATORIUM. OPPOSITION AND OTHERS ARE OUTSIDE OF THAT POSITION THAT SEEMS TO BE INTRINSICALLY UNFAIR. I THINK IT'S JUST THE FRUSTRATION OF KNOWING SOME ADVOCATES GETTING DONE WITHIN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS SOME WORDS TAKING SEVERAL YEARS WERE THAT IT DOES. SEEM LIKE A DE FACTO MORATORIUM TERRIBLY PASTOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON STALKING ABOUT RIGHT WITH THAT LET ME ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DÃ­AS. HEARING AND SEEING ON WE ARE NOW AT LIKE TWO AND A HALF HOURS INTO THIS HEARING. RIGHT SIR BRADFORD IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IS GONNA. BY PASSES QUESTIONS. IN ORDER TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO THE NEXT PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE'RE TO MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FOUR COMMENTS FROM STAKEHOLDERS FORGET PLEASE HAVE. AT THE TABLE TASHA SERRA. MAYOR CITY OF GARDENA AND CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA CITIES FOR SELF RELIANCE TRYING POWERS WITH ALREADY. KYLE KIRKLIN OWNER CLUB ONE CASINO PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA GAMING ASSOCIATION CLARK ROSE OWNER CAPITAL CASINO. AND PRESIDENT COMMUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA CARD ROOMS. JOE HARN GENERAL COUNSEL BICYCLE HOTEL AND CASINO. AND MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA CARDROOM. ALLIANCE THANK YOU GUYS FOR ALL BEING HERE TODAY AND FOR LISTENING TO TODAY'S TESTIMONY HOPEFULLY IT'S BEEN INFORMATIVE. IF I COULD PLEASE JUST ASK THAT. EVERYONE LIMIT THEIR OPENING REMARKS TO THREE MINUTES OR LESS THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL AND I KNOW THAT THE MEMBERS UP HERE AT THE DÃ­AS WOULD APPRECIATE CONCISE COMMENTS. SO WITH THAT WHOEVER'S READY TO BEGIN. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO FIRST START OFF BY APOLOGIZING FOR WEARING SUNGLASSES TODAY BUT I JUST HAD EYE SURGERY I'M SENSITIVE TO LIGHT RIGHT NOW THE MY NAME IS TASHA SIR TO AND I'M THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA CITIES FOR SELF RELIANT JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY I'M ALSO THE MAYOR OF THE CITYOF GARDENA AND I JUST LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON FOR ASKING THE QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO CITIES. I THINK THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR REQUESTING THIS AUDIT OF THE BUREAU OF THE GAMBLING CONTROL AND THE GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION WE ALSO THINK THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR INVITING US TO TESTIFY AT THIS HEARING. OUR JPA CONSISTS OF SEVEN CITIES WHICH ARE BILL GARDEN. PALMER'S COMPTON CUT HAY. GARDENA WINE GARDENS. IN INGLEWOOD. THE JPA WAS ORGANIZED TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE COMMON ECONOMIC INTERESTS. AND CONCERNS OF ITS MEMBER CITIES AND TO ENGAGE ON PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES WHICH AFFECT. THESE CONCERNS INCLUDING THAT WHICH WE WHICH EACH OF US LOOK WE ARE REGULATED BY A CAR CLUBS. THE JPA REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF OVER HALF A MILLION RESIDENTS. LOCAL BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES. CAR CLUBS ARE MAJOR INPUT OUR MAJOR EMPLOYERS IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY RESIDE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CARD CLUBS GENERATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE TO SUPPORT LOCAL SERVICES SUCH AS POLICE AND FIRE PROTECTION AND SOCIAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND SENIORS. IN THE CITY OF HAWAIIAN GARDENS FOR EXAMPLE CARCLUB REVENUES ACCOUNT 47280% OF THAT OF THE CITY'S GENERAL FUND. I HAVE A LIST OF SERVICES THAT ARE SEVEN CITIES ARE PROVIDED WITH THE REVENUE OF OUR CAR CLUBS LICENSING AGREEMENTS THAT THAT ARE GENERATED THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ENTER INTO RECORD I BELIEVE YOU HAVE THOSE NOW. IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE. AFFECT THE SURPRISES MANY PEOPLE IS THAT ONE IN FIVE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA PLAYS HOST TO CARD CLUBS. RELYING ON THOSE CAR CLUBS NOT ONLY FOR GENERAL FUND REVENUE BUT RELYING ON THEM TO PLAY AN INTEGRAL PART IN THOSE CITIES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE ECONOMIC VITALITY OF THOSE CITIES THAT HOLES CAR CLUB IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED TO THE ECONOMIC VITALITY OF THOSE CARD CLUBS. WHEN THE STATE AUDITOR FINDS THAT THE BUREAU EXCEEDS THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME TO PROCESS GAME LICENSING APPLICATIONS 470% OF THE FIVE THOUSAND AND TWELVE APPLICATIONS IT'S REVIEWED OVER FIVE YEARS. BUT SOME APPLICATIONS TAKEN AS LONG AS SIX YEARS TO COMPLETE. IT IS INEXTRICABLE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND NOT KNOW THAT THESE PROBLEMS EXISTED OR TO WHAT MAGNITUDE THEY ARE. THIS VALUE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND BY THE BUREAU OF GAMMA CONTROL MATERIALLY IMPACTS THE CITIES THAT ARE HOSTING CAR CLUBS BY REDUCING TAX REVENUES TO SUPPORT SERVICES FOR CHILDREN SENIORS AND FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THE INEFFICIENCIES OF THE BUREAU OF GAMMA CONTROL JEOPARDIZE ONE IN FIVE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AFTER REVIEWING THE STATE AUDIT IT APPEARS TO US THAT THE BUREAU IS NOT CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT ITS CORE FUNCTION AND THEREFORE WE ASK THAT THE LEGISLATOR TO CONTINUE STATUTORY ALTERNATIVES TO ADDRESS THIS MATTER. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THESE THREE COMMITTEES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR A- MAKE SURE YOU REFERENCE THE AUDITS IN THEIR IF I COULD HAVE. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY BUT WITH YOU PLEASE BE CONCISE AND TO THE AUDIT WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. AREA MEMBERS THE COMMITTEES THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THE CALIFORNIA GAMING ASSOCIATION TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING. MY NAME IS KYLE KIRKLAND ON THE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA GAMING ASSOCIATION FOR TRADE GROUP THAT REPRESENTS THE CALIFORNIA CARDROOM INDUSTRY. OUR MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES A MAJORITY OF ACTIVE CARD ROOMS IN THE STATE AND IS GOVERNED BY AN ELECTED BOARD. OF CARTONS OF ALL SIZES AND FROM ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE. OUR INDUSTRY EMPLOYS OVER TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS IN LIVING WAGE JOBS AND CONTRIBUTES MILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS TO COMMUNITY STATEWIDE. IN MANY COMMUNITIES WERE THE LARGEST LOCAL TAXPAYER IN SOME CASES ARE TAXPAYERS COMPRISES THE MAJORITY OF THE CITY'S BUDGET. I'M ALSO THE OWNER OPERATOR OF CLUB ONE CASINO IN FRESNO AND TWO OTHER CARD GAMES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE EMPLOY OVER THREE AND A PERSONS AND CONTRIBUTE ONE MILLION TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CITY OF FRESNO GENERAL FUND. THE OTTERS REPORT CONFIRMED WILL MANY CARD ROOMS HAVE LONG EXPERIENCED IN LICENSING INEFFICIENCIES AND DELAYS IN CONSISTENT FEES AND PROCESSES AND SUGGESTS A REAL IMPACT ON OUR INDUSTRY. WE OFTEN A WE HEAR FREQUENT COMPLAINTS FROM MEMBERS. ON THE ISSUES I CAN CONFIRM SOME FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE. I WOULD OVER FOUR YEARS TO RECEIVE A LICENSE FOR SMALL CARAMEL WATSONVILLE WHEN I'D ALREADY BEEN LICENSED IN FRESNO FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS. AND BY SELLING OFF FOR OVER SIX. FURTHER WITH EACH OF OUR APPLICATIONS AND RENEWALS THE PROCESS INQUIRY AND TIMING VERY CONSIDERABLY. WHILE THE AUDITOR IDENTIFIED INCONSISTENT PROCESSES DATA COLLECTION AND DEADLINES AT THE BUREAU. COMMISSION ACTIONS ALSO APPEAR ARBITRARY INCONSISTENT TO THE INDUSTRY INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS OFTEN LEAVE COMMISSION MEETINGS CONFUSED BY THE COMMENTS AND ACTIONS TAKEN. TO BE SURE OUR INDUSTRY CAN DO A BETTER JOB IN TERMS OF RESPONSIVENESS AN ATTENTION TO DETAIL IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS BUT THERE'S A REAL HUMAN IMPACT FROM LACK OF CONSISTENCY. OUR JOBS PROVIDE REAL CALM OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE A LACK OF PREDICTABILITY AND LICENSING HURTS OUR ABILITY TO ADD STAFF AND OFFER. EMPLOYEES CAREER GROWTH. WELL THE OTTER CONCLUDED THAT BOTH THE COMMISSION AND THE BUREAU. IF YOU'RE OPEN TO RECOMMENDATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS DISTURBING TO US WAS THE EXCHANGE IN SOME OF THE TERMINOLOGY AND THE COMMENTS AT THE END WITH TERMS LIKE MISLEADING DISINGENUOUS MIS CHARACTERIZES INACCURATE MISSES THE POINT. AND WILD. THE REGULATORY BODIES APPEAR OPEN TO THE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT AT LEAST AT SOME LEVEL THERE SOME RESISTANCE TO CHANGE WE ENCOURAGE ALL PARTICIPANTS TO EMBRACE THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS LOOK FOR BEST PRACTICES AND OTHER LICENSING AGENCIES SUCH AS THE BUREAU CONSUME AFFAIRS. OR OTHER STATES TO REGULATE GAMING. IT'S LIKELY TO THAT ANY LASTING CHANGE WILL REQUIRE SUBS IN MODIFICATION OF THE GAMMA CONTROL ACT AND RELATED REGULATIONS. HISTORICALLY OUR INDUSTRIES EMBRACE THE OPTION TO WORK WITH REGULATORS ELECTED OFFICIALS. CAN BE ADVANCE AND SUBSEQUENT ATER WOULD FIND DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS TO THESE CONCERNS RAISED TODAY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING THE CALIFORNIA GAMING SOCIAL GAMING ASSOCIATION THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY THANK YOU THREE TESTIMONY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CLARK ROSA PRESIDENT OF THE CCC. AND OWNER OPERATED OF CAPITAL CASINO HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE CURRENT WIFE FOR GATED REGULATORY SYSTEM WAS ENACTED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO THE AUDIT RESULTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT GREAT STRUCTURAL CHANGES ARE NECESSARY. EVERY REGULATORY SYSTEM NEEDS STRUCTURES CHECKS AND BALANCES AND PROPER TRAINING TO PREVENT IMPROPER INFLUENCE OF DECISIONS. PROTECTING THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IS CRITICAL IN GAMING REGULATION BECAUSE OF THE BROAD DISCRETION GIVEN TO THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION. THERE IS A WIDESPREAD BELIEF THEY ENFORCE POLICIES IN AN ON EVEN MANNER WHICH IS UNFAIR TO THE APPLICANT THE GAMING INDUSTRY AND THE LEGISLATIVE BODIES THAT HAVE ENTRUSTED THEM WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF REGULATING THE INDUSTRY. THE ON IT HIGHLIGHTS THERE IS A LACK OF POLICIES AND A FINE PROCESSES WHICH PERMITS IN EQUITY AND INEFFICIENCY TO PROCESS. THE BUREAU AND COMMISSION DISCUSS VARYING LEVELS OF REVIEW FOR DIFFERENT LICENSE PLAYERS TYPES HOWEVER NO WHERE IS THERE ANY SPECIFICATION FOR WHAT THOSE REVIEWS ENTAIL ALSO THERE IS A LACK OF CLARITY ON WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REVIEW AND WHETHER THE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED ARE MATERIALLY RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF REVIEW AND THEY DETERMINATIONS THAT THE BEER ON THE COMMISSION ARE BEING ASKED TO MAY. WHEN EVALUATING THESE APPLICATIONS THIS LACK OF CLARITY HAS CREATED THE BACKLOG AND EVER INCREASING DELAY IN REVIEW BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS IS GOING FARTHER INTO THE INDIVIDUALS HISTORY WITHOUT ANY ARTICULATED STANDARD FOR WHY THE BUREAU AND COMMISSION ARE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS. SORRY. THE COMMISSION IN RURAL CANNOT MEET THEIR STATUTORY MANDATE FOR TIMELY ISSUING LICENSE AND INDUSTRIAL WERE SIDE. THE AUDITOR FOUND SIGNIFICANT DUPLICATION AND EFFORTS AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO RELEVANT FACTS WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN DELAYS AND SERVICE BACKLOGS IT CONTINUE TO CREATE ON REASONABLE AND ON WARRANTED HARDSHIP FOR THE CARD ROOM AND ITS EMPLOYEES EVEN THOUGH THE INDUSTRY IS HALF THE SIZE IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN THE GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION WAS ENACTED. IT IS TIME TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE GAMBLING CONTROL LACK SHOULD BE REVISED TO BETTER AND MORE TIMELY SERVE THE INDUSTRY AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC. THE GAMBLING CONTROL ACT PRAGUE WILLING GATED REGULATIONS AND INTERNAL POLICY SHOULD BE VETTED TO ENSURE ELIMINATION OF UNNECESSARY AND PUNITIVE REGULATORY BURDENS ON THE INDUSTRY. THE INDUSTRY SEEKS A CLEAR PROCESS THAT ALLOWS TRANSPIRING STE TRANSPARENCY AND THE ABILITY FOR THE REGULATORY AGENCY TO KEEP THE INDUSTRY FREE OF CRIMINAL OR CORRECTIVE ELEMENTS. ALL REGULATORY AGENCIES ANY CLEAR AND REAL REALISTIC DIRECTIVES THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO HIRE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WHICH WE KNOW THEY HAVE. AND PROVIDE THEM WITH PROPER TRAINING AND TOOLS THE INDUSTRY WELCOMES THE ON A BIT TOO NEEDY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO AMEND THE LAW AND THE REGULATORY BODIES TO DEVELOP WRITTEN REGULATIONS THAT WILL MITIGATE ARBITRARY AND ON REASONS DECISIONS BASED ON UNDEFINED OR NON EXISTENCE POLICIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME APPRECIATE IT. Q. I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS PLEASE CONTINUE TO TIONAL TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SALAS AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY FOR INVITING CALIFORNIA CARTER MILAN'S TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING MY NAME IS JOY HARD I'M GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE BICYCLE HOTEL AND CASINO AND WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE CCA. THIS YEAR'S MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES SEVEN OF THE LARGEST CAR ROOM STATEWIDE WHICH COLLECTIVELY HAVE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY LICENSE TABLES. PROVIDE THOUSANDS OF WELL PAYING JOBS INCLUDING BENEFITS ENABLING EMPLOYEES TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. AND IN MANY COMMUNITIES WE ARE THE LEADING CONTRIBUTOR TO THE TAX BASE. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE GAMBLE CONTROL ACT THE INDUSTRY HAS CONTINUED TO GROW AND DEVELOP AND CHANGE BUT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO REGULATE LICENSE HAVE NOT KEPT PACE. WE SEE THE AUDITOR'S REPORT AS A GUIDE TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS AND FIND THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AND EFFECTIVE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES TO FULFILL THE AGENCY'S LEGISLATIVE MANDATES. WHILE ENSURING TRANSPARENCY FAIRNESS AND EFFICIENCY FOR THOSE BEING REGULATED. OUR CARDROOMS HAVE FRONTLINE EXPERIENCE WITH THESE PROCESSES AND ARE VALUABLE PARTNER COMMITTED TO MEETING FOR REGULATION AND BEST PRACTICES TO IMPROVE LICENSING AND OVERSIGHT. WE ALSO FEEL THE REAL LIFE IMPACT OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS FOR OWNERS AND OPERATORS WHO WERE WAITING YEARS TO OBTAIN A LICENSE. THOSE DELAYS A QUITE TO LOST OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST IN AND GROW THEIR BUSINESSES DEVELOP MUCH NEEDED JOBS AND PROVIDE TAX REVENUES. ALL NEGATIVE IMPACTS WHICH COULD AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED. MORE THAN MERE TINKERING WITH THE STATUS QUO HOWEVER IS REQUIRED. WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES AN UNDERTAKING A COMPREHENSIVE RESTRUCTURING OF THE OVERSIGHT AND LICENSING PROCESS. WE ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDIZED LICENSING PROCEDURES THAT WILL ENSURE AFFECT EFFICIENCY FAIRNESS CONSISTENCY. AND FOCUS ON THE INFORMATION TRULY MEANINGFUL TO DETERMINING SUITABILITY THEY SHOULD REVIEW INCLUDE A REVIEW OF HOW THE PROCEDURES ACTUALLY FURTHER AT THE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE OF EACH AGENCY. INITIAL MATTERS THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE THE NEED FOR STREAMLINED LICENSING PROCESS FOR EXISTING LICENSEES TO INCLUDE CREATING PORTABLE UNDER LICENSE SIMILAR TO WHAT EXIST FOR KIA LICENSEES. A REEVALUATION OF THE RENEWAL PROCESS THAT CURRENTLY REQUIRES AT RENEWAL EVERY TWO YEARS RECORDED REQUIRING UNNECESSARY PAPERWORK AND A DRAIN ON LICENSING STAFF. WHEN OTHER JURISDICTIONS ISSUE EITHER INDEFINITE LICENSES SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE OR SIMPLY LONGER LICENSES. WE UNDERSTAND THE COMMISSION HAS INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO JOIN IN NECESSARY LEGISLATIVE REMEDIES IDENTIFIED BY THE AUDITOR AND THE CCA IS PLEDGING TO WORK WITH THE BUREAU COMMISSION AND LEGISLATURE TO ACHIEVE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDIT. FURTHER CREATE A REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT ENSURES ONLY SUITABLE PEOPLE ARE LICENSED AND ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY AND INEFFICIENT PROCESSES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. THE TESTIMONY PRE SHEET YOU GUYS BEING HERE LET ME JUST ASK A GENERAL KIND OF THRESHOLD QUESTION FOR EACH OF YOU. DO YOU FIND THE ART IT. FINDINGS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YES I THINK THAT THE AUDIT FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE EXPERIENCE OF AS OF THE APPLICANTS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH. GOT SO AND THE WILL TO LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION BUT I WOULD IMAGINE YOU GUYS ARE PROBABLY HEARING THAT FIRST HAND. AND TERMS OF THE BACKLOG WE WERE LOOKING AT THE BACKLOG OF THAT WAS THE DISCUSSIONS WILL EARLIER. BUT OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS IS THERE. DO YOU AGREE WITH ALL THE OTHERS RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE ASK THE QUESTION THAT WAY. YES I% CERTAINLY DO AND SOME OF THESE BACKLOGS AND THE RAMIFICATIONS ON THE PARTICULAR CLUBS. OUR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND AFFECTS A LOT OF LIVES I MEAN. I THINK THE AUDITOR'S DID A EXCELLENT JOB THEY HIT IT HEAD ON ALL EVERYTHING IS A 100% CORRECT. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING THAT'S NOT IN THE AUDIT REPORT THAT WILL HELP. I WOULD PROBABLY BE. HELPFUL AS WELL OR DO YOU THINK THE AUDIT WAS THOROUGH ENOUGH THAT IT. IT OUTLINED A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE I THINK IT OUTLINED MYSELF PERSON HE'S OUR OWN. A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. BEING A BUSINESS OWNER MY ENTIRE LIFE IS EFFICIENCY. AND YOU CAN TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. AND YOU CAN MAKE THEM EFFICIENT AND PROBABLY TRIPLE WHAT GETS DONE WITH PROCEDURES AND POLICIES. BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO OVERSEE IT BECAUSE WHEN YOU LAY DOWN THINGS TO BE DONE YOU GO BACK IN TWO WEEKS IT CHANGES SOMEHOW. SO SOMEBODY HAS TO BE ON IT ALL THE TIME BUT I THINK EFFICIENCY IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM YEAH AND I THINK THERE WAS A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FROM LEGISLATORS A UP HERE CONNECT GEARING TOWARDS THE EFFICIENCY AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. WITH MOVING THROUGH PLACE YOU'RE GONNA MENTION KYLE KIRK ON I WOULD SAY THAT OF THAT OUR MEMBERSHIP IN THE CGA WE CERTAINLY HERE A LOT OF THAT THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT THE AUTHORS MENTIONED OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE BEEN CITED EVERYONE OF THEIR- APPLICATIONS I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE SOME OF THOSE THINGS WERE CONSISTENT. I SAY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE AUDIT. IS CERTAINLY A GREAT START BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AND I THINK ONE OF THE AUTHORS REFERENCE TUTOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTION BROADER FORCE WAS THE OPPORTUNITY LOOK FOR BEST PRACTICES ANOTHER SORT OF LICENSING AGENCIES WHERE THERE'S THE DEPARTMENT. OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS OR IF IT'S AN OUTSIDE JURISDICTION OR FOR IT'S A SOME OF IT NEVADA FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING FOR THAT BEST PRACTICES ON HOW THEY HANDLE LICENSING IN BACKGROUND CHECKS AND EFFICIENCIES AND THREE FIGURING I'M HERE OR CAN MEASURE OURSELVES FOR PERFORMANCE. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT CERTAINLY MAKES US FEEL A LOT BETTER ABOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS. AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. GOT IT YOUR SAID. PLEASE THANK YOU UP WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE AUDIT. ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE MADE. AND YOU KNOW I CAN JUST SPEAK FROM FROM A CITY PERSPECTIVE THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM CASINO SAID. YOU KNOW THE TIME FRAME WHEN I WAS A LONG TIME BUT I'M IT JUST REALLY SADDENS ME THAT THEY WEREN'T TAKING CARE OF THEIR CORE OBJECT IS AND- INSTEAD YOU KNOW PROBABLY WAS BEEN THEIR TIME TO ANOTHER THING SO. SATISFIED WITH THEM WITH THE AUDIT HAS BROUGHT OUT. AND I'M SURE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE HAPPY STAY LONGER. THANK YOU YEAH I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON WAS HOW DO WE CREATE THOSE EFFICIENCIES OR WE'RE LOOKING AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS OUTLINED BY THE AUDITOR WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE POSSIBLY STATUTORILY OR WHAT WE NEED TO DO PROBABLY EVEN AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH BUDGET DISCUSSIONS FOR NEXT YEAR AND THE ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE MOVING FORWARD CENTER BRADFORD I KNOW YOU HAVE QUESTIONS PLEASE. THANK YOU FIRST LET ME WALK ON MY MAYOR SIR YOUR TODAY I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO THE REPORT IN THE REPORT SUGGESTS THE CONTINUATION OF FUNDING OF ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL DESPITE THE SURPLUS IN THE GAMBLING FINE IN THE FACT THAT THE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL THERE STILL A BACKLOG SO DO YOU GUYS SUPPORT. THE CONTINUATION OF THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS DESPITE NOT ACHIEVING. AGO ARE GETTING THE BACKLOG REDUCE I SHOULD SAY. WELL I THINK THAT IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG THEY'RE GONNA NEED THE BODIES TO GET THAT DONE AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY GETTING THAT DONE AND GETTING THESE PEOPLE LICENSES CRITICAL NOT ONLY TO THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES BUT THE CITIES THEY SUPPORT. SO I THINK PART OF THAT PROCESS IS ALLOWING THEM TO CLEAR THAT BACKLOG I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR COMMENTS EARLIER TODAY BY MISSION MAZU THAT ONE OF THE THINGS ARE LOOKING AT IS NOT JUST HOW LONG IT TAKES TO DO WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING. BUT TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS IS THERE ENGAGED IN TRULY ARE DIRECTED TOWARD WHAT IS MEANINGFUL TO DETERMINE SUITABILITY. SO I THINK ONCE ONCE THEY WORK MAY BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND CONTINUE THE WORK THEY'RE DOING WILL BE A GOOD TIME TO RE EVALUATE. WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE NEED IS AND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL MOVE TO CENTER MORE ON. I'M SORRY PLEASE I JUST WANT AND ADD TO THAT CERTAINLY KEEPING THE PERSONNEL ON INTO WHAT DIRECTOR SHE MATSU SAID WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY WITH THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT PAYING ATTENTION YOU KNOW DIRECTLY TO HOW MUCH TIME FOLKS ARE SPENDING ACTUALLY ON THE UP. APPLICATION PROCESS YOU KNOW LIKE TO GET A CHANCE TO USE THE RESOURCES. INTO BENEFIT THE INDUSTRY WHILE THEY HAVE A. WEEDING CORROSION TO CONTINUE THAT. YOU'RE ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE FUNDING ON THOSE POSITIONS DESPITE TO SURPLUS WOULD JUST BE WORLD SHE WOULD DIRECT SOME OF THOSE FUNDS TO DO SO I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY THIS AND WE'RE NOT REALLY IN A POSITION TO POINT TO THAT I DO THINK THE HAVING A LOOK AT WHERE THE FILE ON THE FEES ARE AND WHERE THE COSTS ARE GETTING THIS MORNING ALIGNMENT WERE A LIKE TO SEE IT AS WELL. MAN TO THE QUESTIONS WELL. I DON'T SUPPORT GIVING THEM MORE MONEY I MEAN YOU DON'T REWARD AN ORGANIZATION FOR NOT GETTING THE JOB DONE. IF THEY'RE NOT HANDLING NOW THEY'VE HAD A COUPLE YEARS TO GET THIS DONE SO IF THEY CAN HANDLE I SUGGEST MOVING IT TO A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION. IT'S OBVIOUS IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. I THINK A ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WOULD DO A BETTER JOB WITH THIS SO THAT'S MY SUGGESTION. GOD I FEEL WITHOUT. ALL THE POLICIES THAT HAVE TO BE CHANGED AND TO MAKE IT THE OPERATION MORE EFFICIENT. FOR PEOPLE COMING IN. YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST BRING IN MORE PEOPLE. ON THE SAME POLICIES AYE AYE I COULD SEE GIVING FUNDING FOR MORE PEOPLE ONCE ALL THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES ARE IN PLACE AND THEN YOU SEE IT OPERATING GREAT NOW YOU CAN BRING IN A FEW MORE PEOPLE. TRAINED THEM PUT THEM IN WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE AND THEN MOVE FORWARD BUT TO BRING A MAN NOW. THE END OF THAT WOULD BE NO HELP AT ALL. THANK YOU YEAH NO I THINK THAT WAS SOME OF THE DISCUSSION EARLIER TO WRITE WAS THE EFFICIENCY. AND ARE WE SHOWING THAT EFFICIENCY AND I KNOW WILD I KNOW THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN ONE OF. THE GRASS IN THE AUDIT WAS BRINGING ADDITIONAL. INDIVIDUALS ON BOARD BUT NOT SEEING A GREAT REDUCTION IN. AN ACTUAL CASE LOADS. AND NOT SEEING THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BILLABLE HOURS. SO WE'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT I DO WANT TO MOVE TO SOUTHERN MOROCCO AS A QUESTION THANK YOU MUCH LATER ARE TRYING TO ASK THOSE THE QUESTION IT SOONER BRADFORD **** BUT FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE TO REFUND. WELL NOT. IT WOULD BE HARD TO PIN DOWN WHERE A REFUND WOULD COME FROM BECAUSE EVERY PARTICULAR CLUB STARTED KYLE DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT MU BUT YOU TURN IN SO MANY FORMS AND PAPERS OVER THE YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE CARD ROOM BUSINESS IN SACRAMENTO FOR TWENTY SEVEN HERE'S AN AD I WOULDN'T EVEN START TO GO BACK. FOR REFUND. HAD HOW ABOUT IT THE REDUCTION GOING FORWARD. WELL IT IT I MEAN THAT WOULD HELP BUT IF IT WOULD HELP. I WOULD DECLINE MY REFUND OR LOWER PRICES IF THE EFFICIENCY AND THE JOB WAS DONE THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE I DON'T WANT TO CUT ANYTHING BACK AND HAVE IT GO BACKWARDS BECAUSE OF FUNDING. SO THEN IN THAT REGARD WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKED BY THE AG AS YOU'RE GOING TO THE PROCESS YOU KNOW YOU'RE WAITED A COUPLE MONTHS AND ALSO NAY CALLED ASK A QUESTION WE NEED X. Y. WHAT WHAT IS THAT ONE OF THE ASKING FOR THIS WELL KYLE A HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT BECAUSE HE HAS A CARD ROOM IN WATSONVILLE THAT TWO PM FOR YEARS TO GET A LICENSE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE QUESTIONS WERE. MY GOD JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS ONE ON A IN GOING THROUGH THE AUDIT AND SEEING SOME OF THE THINGS ARE BROUGHT UP UNSERVED TIMING IN PROCESS OR WHATEVER REFLECTING ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE YOU KNOW WE SOUGHT WAR OR DIFFERENT AUTHORS TO ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THE PROCESS WASN'T NESTLE SAME NOW EVERY APPLICATION WE HAD IS DIFFERENT RIGHT IN EVERY COURTROOM IN JURISDICTIONS A DIFFERENT ORDINANCE AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO THERE ARE DIFFERENCES. BUT WASN'T REALLY CLEAR THAT THERE IS SORT OF A CHECKLIST OF A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH THAT HAS CHANGED OVER TIME I'VE BEEN LICENSE FOR OVER A DECADE NOW SO THE PROCESS IS CHANGED A LITTLE BIT. BUT IN TERMS OF CONSISTENCY OF QUESTIONS WHAT WAS ASKED MATERIALS PROVIDED CERTAINLY APPLICATION WAS CONSISTENT BUT THEN THE FOLLOW ON WORK THAT WAS DONE AFTER THAT BY THE I'M COUNTY INVESTIGATOR THAT THE PERSON WORKING THE FILE. WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT AND IT WASN'T CLEAR AT ALL HOW IT WAS ON THE TIME FOR TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS IS CERTAINLY. IN IN MY EXPERIENCE DIDN'T FOLLOW ANY KIND OF PRESCRIBED DEADLINES SO IT'S A UNIT TO JUST WE CERTAINLY HEAR COMPLAINTS FROM THE INDUSTRY ON THAT AND I WOULD TELL YOU YOU KNOW WE ROUTINELY WITH OUR- OUR OWN EMPLOYEES HAVE TO CHASTISE THEM TO RESPOND TO DEADLINES AND GET THE INFORMATION OUT TO BE ACCURATE AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING. HELP THEM READ THROUGH THE QUESTIONS TO GET TO WHAT THE BUREAU IS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR SO SOME OF THAT FALLS ON THE INDUSTRY AS WELL BUT FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND SAYING OKAY IF I CAN FILTER THROUGH. THE NOISE WAS IT CONSISTENT WELL I WOULD SAY IT WAS A LOT OF CLARITY PREDICTABILITY AND ALL THAT LACK OF PREDICTABILITY DEFINITELY HINDERS SOMEONE'S WILLINGNESS TO GO FORTH AND ONE INVEST MORE TIME ENERGY MONEY. IN THESE OPPORTUNITIES. ARE ON THE STATE. THANK YOU AND. A SETTLEMENT PATTERSON BROUGHT UP FRIENDS BUT I HAVE BEEN FASCINATED WITH THE CITY OF HAWAIIAN GARDENS. THAT 76% OF ITS REVENUES WOULD COME. FROM ONE CARD CLUB AND THAT'S THAT'S A LITTLE SCARY TO ME AND I CAME UP IN A I SERVED ON BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE WHICH IS CORRECTIONS PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUDICIARY AND I MY REVIEW A LOT OF COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTS OF CITY SCHOOLS EVERYBODY. AND SO THIS WAS A VERY. SHOCKING KIND OF. DISCOVERY IN SO DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE GARDEN CASINO I YOU KNOW GOOGLE THEM AND THEY DON'T COME UP IS THE POSTER CHILD OF VIRTUE EITHER. SO THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE DICEY AND I'M WONDERING. WITH YOUR ASSOCIATIONS ARE YOU SELF REGULATING. ARE YOU AN ORGANIZATION THAT SAYS WE'RE NOT ONLY TAKING YOUR DUES BUT IF YOU'RE STEPPING. BEYOND CERTAIN BOUNDARIES WE WILL CALL YOU ON IT. SO SPEAKING FOR THE CJ WE SPEND A FAIR BIT OF TIME ENCOURAGING COMPLIANCE WITHIN YOUR ARE AMONG OUR MEMBERS IT'S IT IS A WIDE RANGE OF MEMBERS ANYWHERE FROM THE LARGEST CARD FROM THE STATE TO HONOR SEVEN TABLES THE COMMERCE CASINO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ONE TO TWO TABLE CARD ROOMS. WHEN WE HAVE OUR ANNUAL MEETINGS WE PRESSED FOR COMPLIANCE AND EDUCATION WE CERTAINLY ON A MORE NOT A POLICING BODY BUT- DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT HEY LISTEN. THE MORE THAT WE STAY IN LINE THE BETTER IT IS FOR THE INDUSTRY AND BETTER IT IS FOR EVERYONE OUT THERE. SO. IN A CERTAINLY THE INDUSTRY'S RAISE AWARENESS SOMETHINGS LIKE TITLE THIRTY ONE COMPLIANCE NON BANK SECRECY ACT. MANY OF YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. HOW WE PRESSED FOR PROBLEM GAMBLING GAMBLING EDUCATION THE USE OF THE RESOURCES OUT THERE FRIDAY PEACHY AND OTHERS. ARE REALLY ENCOURAGING OUR MEMBERS TO. YOU KNOW PLEASE STAY IN COMPLIANCE AND FRANKLY TO THEIR JOB. THEIR PART OF THE PROCESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON. JUST A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR SUMMER OF RECORD SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS. AND BY THE WAY I THINK YOU REALLY LOOK. SO THE UNDER RECOMMENDS ACTIVITY BY THE LEGISLATURE. BY THE BUREAU BY THE BEER IN THE COMMISSION AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND I JUST. QUICKLY POINT TO IT GOOD VERY QUICKLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT APPROVE ANY REQUEST TO MAKE PERMANENT FUNDING FOR THOSE THIRTY TWO ADDITIONAL POSITIONS SO THERE'S SOME FAIRLY CLEAR. THAT ADVICE HERE DELAYS IN THE UNNECESSARY USE OF RESOURCES THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD AMEND THE GAMBLING ACT. TO ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO TAKE ACTION AT ITS REGULAR LICENSING MEETINGS RATHER THAN REQUIRING TO HOLD EVIDENTIAL HEARINGS I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING. STREAMLINING EFFORT WITH WITHOUT THE- ELIMINATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LICENSE APPROPRIATELY. THE BEER SHOULD ESTABLISH A FORMAL PLAN. TO COMPLETE ITS REVIEW OF THE REMAINING PENDING APPLICATIONS LET'S GET THIS. BACKLOG COMPLETED THE BEER SHOULD ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT REQUIRE STAFF TO PROPERLY AND EQUITABLY REPORT AND BILL THE TIME. THE DAY EXPAND CONDUCTING SUCH INVESTIGATIONS AND TO BETTER ALIGN THE REVENUE IN THE GAMBLING FUND WITH THE COSTS OF THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT THE FUND SUPPORTS THE BEER IN THE COMMISSION SHOULD CONDUCT COST ANALYSIS. ACTIVITIES AND THEY SHOULD ADJUST THEIR FEES TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL COST. OF THE OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES THEY PERFORM I'M ASSUMING YOU CONCUR WITH THESE GENERAL. OF RECOMMENDATIONS. YES YES AND I THINK TO THE MEMBERS HERE THIS PRESENTS PRETTY GOOD. PATHWAY TO YEAH GETTING TO SOMEBODY'S A DEFINITELY A GREAT START OKAY YOU SEE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HEARING AND SEEING NO MORE QUESTIONS FROM THE DÃ­AS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING TESTIMONY WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS PUBLIC COMMENT SEVERAL COME OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IF YOU'RE AFFILIATED WITH THAT ORGANIZATION PLEASE STATE THAT IF YOU'RE NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE ORGANIZATION YOU CAN MENTION THE I COUNTY YOU RESIDE IN PLACE AGAIN. JOHN LEVEL I REPRESENT PLAYERS POKER CLUB IN VENTURA ALSO ANOTHER POINT IN MY LIFE I WAS CHIEF DEPUTY LA CITY CONTROLLER SO HAVE SOME ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE WITH AUDITS AND I CAN TELL YOU BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE THE AUDIT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU REVEALS FUNDAMENTAL DYSFUNCTION MISTER PATTERSON GOT IT RIGHT WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE COGNIZABLE ARM THAT IS BEING DONE TO BUSINESSES AND TO CITIES AND WE BELIEVE I BELIEVE THAT THE MAYOR OF GUARDINO HAS IT RIGHT. THAT THIS ENTIRE FUNCTION SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS WHERE THEY HAVE EXPERTISE. AND EXPERIENCE WITH THE LICENSING FUNCTION. THANK YOU. MAY I ASK IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENTS. HEARING AND SEEING NINE OF RIO. WORKING THEIR WAY TO THE MICROPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LORETTA TOOL T. E. L. L.

ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSIONER EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY CARRYING OUT THEIR STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO LICENSING AND REGULATED CARD ROOMS IN CALIFORNIA.
