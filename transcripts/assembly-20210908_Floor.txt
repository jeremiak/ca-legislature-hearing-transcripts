SEETHER OF THE CORRECT IMMEDIATELY THIS PARA QUE HAN YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT SB SEVEN FORTY TWO A BILL THAT BALANCES THE RIGHT TO ACCESS HEALTHCARE PRIVACY AND CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AS A BODY WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WORKING SIDE BY SIDE TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE AND THE DATA TO SAVE AS MANY LIVES AS WE CAN DURING THIS PANDEMIC. OFTEN AT THE COST TO OTHER PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SEEN A FOUR AND A HALF. MILLION CASES A CO IN NINETEEN AND SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PLUS PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS PANDEMIC. WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE PAIN OF TRYING TO GRIEVE FOR LOVED ONES FROM AFAR. SOME HAVING TO SAY GOODBYE OVER FACETIME. WE HAVE THE STREAM THE STRAIN ON FAMILIES WORKING FROM HOME OR LOSING THEIR JOBS AND THE ECONOMY SUFFERED. MANY OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED NEEDING TO SUPPORT OUR CHILDREN. LEARNING ON A COMPUTER INSTEAD OF IN THE CLASSROOM. THE STRUGGLE OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE BEEN THE ONES WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO ADDRESS AMONGST THE OTHERS. MANY OF US EVEN WORSHIP TO VIRTUALLY SOMETHING WE NEVER IMAGINED IN PRIOR YEARS. ALL OF THIS WAS TO BUY TIME UNTIL SCIENCE COULD CATCH UP. AND WE WOULD HAVE THE BREAKTHROUGHS TO KEEP THE COMMUNITY SAFE. BECAUSE OF DECADES OF RESEARCH AND I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THE SCIENCE A WOMAN. WE NOW HAVE THE VACCINES THEY CAN KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. AND WHILE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD TO DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINES AND EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITIES WE KNOW THAT THEIR ANTI VACCINE EXTREMISTS THAT ARE ESCALATING THEIR TACTICS TO DISRUPT AND STOPS THESE VACCINE EFFORTS. THAT IS WHY TODAY I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT SB SEVEN FORTY TWO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOTH PRACTICE FREE SPEECH AND GET THE HEALTHCARE THAT THEY DESERVE. AND NEED PUBLIC OFFICIALS NEED THE TOOLS TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS AND FRONTLINE WORKERS AT OUR VACCINE CLINICS ARE SAFE FROM INTIMIDATION HARASSMENT AND PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTION. MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE VACCINE CLINIC AT DODGER STADIUM WAS SHUT DOWN WHEN EXTREMISTS BLOCKED PEOPLE FROM ENTERING. THIS IS HAPPENING ALL OVER OUR STATE AND OFTEN TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO THE VIRUS. AN ADDITIONAL THING THAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THE HEALTHCARE INFORMATION OUR MOST PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE LOST THE PROJECT IS BEING OUTED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE VIDEOTAPING AND PHOTOGRAPHING PATIENTS TO OUT THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH CARE INFORMATION. AS WE CONTINUE TO NEED TO SPREAD THE VACCINE AS OUR YOUNG CHILDREN GET ACCESS TO IT WE WILL NEED TO USE STADIUM SCHOOL CAMPUSES A NONTRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE SETTINGS TO DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE. AND WE NEED THESE PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN DO SO. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS WHO WORK TIRELESSLY. TO WRITE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE EVEN IN THE DARKEST DAYS OF THIS PANDEMIC. THEY SHOULD BE FEAR OF HARASSMENT ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE. THAT IS JUST IN THE GUISE OF PROTEST. MANY MIGHT ARGUE OR SOME MIGHT ARGUE THAT THIS BILL TAKES AWAY FREE SPEECH BUT AS WE ALL KNOW. THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH. IS NOT WITHOUT LIMITS. TIME PLACE AND MANNER RESTRICTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY ALLOWED. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY. THERE'S AN URGENCY CLAUSE IN THIS BILL MEMBERS SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS WORK DONE NOW. AND PROTECT AS MANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU IS BETTER K. THIS GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

WHERE PROTESTERS ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO SCARE PATIENTS OF CHILDREN SEEKING MEDICAL CARE FOR COMPLEX HEALTH CONDITIONS. MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT EVEN ELIGIBLE TO GET THE VACCINE AT THIS TIME. SB SEVEN FORTY TO STRIKE THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE RIGHT OF THOSE WHO WISH TO SAFELY AND FREELY EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE PERSONAL MEDICAL DECISION OF SOMEONE THAT THEY'VE NEVER EVEN MET. FIRST OF THE ABILITY OF THAT PERSON TO ACTUALLY MAKE A MEDICAL DECISION FOR THEMSELVES. LAST WEEK THE HOUSE OVERWHELMINGLY SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WHEN IT COMES TO TH MISINFORMATION BEING A SPOUSE ONLINE AND ACROSS OTHER SOCIAL PLATFORMS WHEN WE DECLARED PUBLIC HEALTH MISINFORMATION A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. TODAY WE CAN START TO OVERCOME THAT CRISIS BY ENSURING THE REMAINING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THEIR VACCINE REGIMEN CAN DO SORT DO SO WITHOUT FEAR OF INTIMIDATION OR ASSAULT.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IS MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN OPPOSITION OF AB ONE OH ONE MEMBERS I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT KNOWLEDGE OF OUR HISTORY PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN SHAPING WHO. WE BECOME IT'S CLEAR THAT WHEN STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT THEIR HISTORY THEIR CULTURE AND THEIR BACKGROUND THEY ARE SO MUCH MORE ENGAGED IN THE CLASSROOM. MY HAVE MY FAMILY HAS A HISTORY LIKE THAT AS YOU MANY OF YOURS MY GRANDPARENTS FIRST CAME TO CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN ELEVEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN FROM MEXICO THEY MOVED TO THE KERN COUNTY TO BAKERSFIELD. TICKETS IN THE FIELDS OF GRAPES AND CON YOU NAME IT MY FAMILY PICKED IT AND ARE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS IS A HUGE THEY ARE PART OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT MY GRANDMOTHER. WORKED ALONGSIDE SAYS HER TRAVIS IN THE FIELDS WITH GRAPES I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURE MY FAMILY HAS LIVED THIS. WE TALK IN THIS CHAMBER ABOUT HOW THE STORY OF IMMIGRANTS HELP MAKE UP THE AMERICAN HIS AMERICAN HISTORY. LITERATURE AND CULTURE WE ALL AGREE THAT THESE STORIES ARE SIGNIFICANT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR COLLECTIVE HISTORY. AS AMERICANS THEY HELP DEFINE WHO WE ARE AS A COLLECTIVE. MY STORY AND YOUR STORIES ARE PART OF THE STORY- PART OF THE STORY AND CULTURE OF THIS COUNTRY AND STATE. IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE INTERESTED IN SEQUESTERING THESE STORIES AND UNNATURALLY REMOVING THEM FROM OUR COLLECTIVE HISTORY. LET'S TELL THE STORIES THE WAY THEY NEED TO BE TAUGHT IN CONTEXT MY STORY AND YOUR STORY ARE A PART OF HISTORY A PART OF LITERATURE AND A PART OF SOCIAL SOCIAL STUDIES. THIS BILL DOESN'T TEACHER STORIES IN CONTEXT INSTEAD IT REMOVES THE STORIES AND PLACES THEM AND SEPARATE IN A SEPARATE CLASS. IT PLACES A NEW GRADUATION REQUIREMENT ON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS MOST OF WHOM HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LEARNING LOSS AND A POTENTIALLY WORSENS. THEIR CHEAP MAKE UP WE CAN'T GET THE BREAK THE BASICS RIGHT IN MATH AND ENGLISH. AND EVEN THOUGH I BELIEVE THE AUTHOR WELL INTENTIONED I SINCERELY FEEL THAT THE BILL WILL PROMPT FURTHER DIVISION AMONG OUR STUDENTS AND WILL IRONICALLY WORSEN ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. FOR MOST DISADVANTAGED MINORITY STUDENTS I URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. MS GARCIA YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU ADDRESS THE STRONG SUPPORTER THIS BILL AND I WANT TO REFERENCE. TO COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN L. A. COUNTY JUST MENTIONED ONE ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING IN MATH AND BASS AND OTHER BASIC SUBJECTS AT THE FORMER MATH TEACHER. I KNOW FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT OUR STUDENTS GOING ABOUT THEIR HISTORY RESTRAINS- THE TAP IN THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY ONLY MAKES IS BETTER STUDENTS TO MAKE IT MORE RESILIENT. I OFTEN THINK TO MYSELF ABOUT THE CHALLENGES MY FAMILY HAS GONE THROUGH- ALSO I SAW FARMWORKERS ALSO HAS UNDOCUMENTED ALONG THE WAY. ANYTHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY CAN FROM THAT STOCK- AND THAT'S AUGUSTINIANS THAT'S AND I WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. AND OFTEN AT THE MY TEACHER I WOULD TELL MY STUDENTS THINK ABOUT THAT REMEMBER THOSE STORIES. A WE WERE THE- THINKING INTO CONGRESS BUT WE THRIVED ANYWAYS. A LOT OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY AND SO. I KNOW FIRST ND FOREMOST ANECDOTALLY THAT THIS WORKS. SECONDLY RESEARCH TELLS US THAT THIS WORK BETTER STUDENTS DO BETTER WHEN THEY ARE EXPOSED TO THEIR HISTORY. THIRD THIS IDEA ABOUT THE VISION I THINK THE MORE WE TECH TELL THEIR STORIES. AND THE MORE WE TELL THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR REALITIES. THE CLOTHES ARE GOING TO BE THE MORE EMPATHY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. AND THE BETTER STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE TO BE THE LEADERS THAT WE NEED THEM TO BE. OUT THERE SO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE. OUT THERE AND I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO NOT IGNORE THE RESURGENT NOT IGNORE THE DATA OUT THERE. AND NOT JUST VOTE ON REACTIONARY STATEMENTS OUT THERE. ARE THIS COMFORT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A BAD THING- SOMETIMES WE'VE DONE A LOT TO MAKE PEOPLE COMFORTABLE. AS PEOPLE OF COLOR BUT IT'S TIME THAT SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE OUT THERE. SO THAT WE CAN MOVE EVERYONE FORWARD AND NOT JUST A CERTAIN PART OF THE POPULATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE. THANK YOU MS GARCIA MISTER BRIAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG. STRONG STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. PRIOR TO BEING A MEMBER OF THIS BODY I TAUGHT AND- ETHNIC STUDIES RESEARCH CENTER. AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES. WE DON'T KNOW OUR HISTORY IN SCHOOLS AND AT THE TIME THIS COUNTRY AND CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS UNDER ATTACK AND WRITE HIS HISTORY IS BEING SUBVERTED FOR REVISIONIST HISTORY. ALL ACROSS THE SOUTH AND ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THIS IS CALIFORNIA THIS IS WHERE WE LEAD. THIS BILL WAS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN ALL THE ETHNIC POCKETS IS THE JEWISH CONGRESS AND OTHERS WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT RACISM. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE WE HAVE TO TALK. ABOUT ANTI IMMIGRATION SENTIMENTS WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ISLAMOPHOBIA WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ANTI SEMITISM I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT COLLECTIVELY UP AND DOWN THE STATE WE DO IT AT THE COLLEGIATE LEVEL. I WOULD DO IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND THERE'S NO REASON ALL HIGH SCHOOLS. WHICH ARE FILLED WITH MORE STUDENTS OF COLOR THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO THE HISTORY BEING TAUGHT I'M PROUD OF THIS LEGISLATURE. THIS BILL HAS BEEN THREE YEARS IN THE MAKING IT'S LONG OVERDUE. LET'S PASS IT TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME. MINISTER BERMAN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I PROBABLY RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE OH ONE AND ONCE THEY ALSO DO IT ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS AND THE CHAIR OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS. WHO CAN'T BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY IN SECOND DAY SERVICES FOR RUSSIA SHAWNA- BUT WAS JUST TEXTING ME FRANTICALLY I MAKING SURE THAT WE SPEAK UP IN SUPPORT MAKING SURE THAT WE- EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO THE AUTHOR OF AB ONE OH ONE FOR HIS STEADFAST LEADERSHIP OF THIS ISSUE AND FOR A LITTLE. DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHNIC STUDIES- BUT ALSO ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT. THERE'S SOME GUARDRAILS IN THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT. ON CERTAIN THINGS THAT WERE OF CONCERN IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE. OUR ADDRESS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR GUARDRAILS THAT. MAKE SURE THAT FOR EXAMPLE ANTI SEMITISM CANNOT BE TAUGHT. IN OUR SCHOOLS AND THE AUTHOR HAS DONE THAT- AND HE'S HE'S PUT THOSE GUARDRAILS IN THIS BILL AND WE ARE GRATEFUL TO HIM. FOR HIM BEING OPEN TO DOING THAT AS WITH ANY THROUGH OUR CONVERSATIONS. I'VE LEARNED THINGS ABOUT MY OWN COMMUNITY FROM COLLEAGUES WHO AREN'T A PART OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY- AND I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT THIS IS MEANT TO. PROMOTE AND SPUR- THOSE CONVERSATIONS SO THAT WE ALL LEARN FROM EACH OTHER BUT THAT WE ALL LIVE AND LEARN. THE TRUTH. ABOUT OUR HISTORY AND THE TRUTH ABOUT OTHER COMMUNITIES HISTORIES THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA SUCH AN AMAZING PLACE- BECAUSE OUR DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH T IS UNEQUIVOCAL- AND ETHICS IT BUT THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE PEOPLE GROWING UP IN CARE AND GOING TO SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T LEARN THEIR TRUE HISTORY. IS A SHAME. AND IT'S A SHAME THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT'S A SHAME THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP. ADDRESS SO THE CHAIR OF THE JEWISH CUCUS I MEAN A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER STUFF I WAS SUPPOSED TO READ. I'M NOT GOING TO- BUT JUST AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL- FOR HIS DIALOGUE WITH US- AND HEARING US. IN FOR IS HIS LONG LEADERSHIP OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU.

I'M I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU AS AN AND OF FORMER DEPORTED IMMIGRANT AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS UP UNTIL I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT MY JOURNEY TO THIS. AMAZING FLOOR HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT. FOR YEARS I FELT GUILTY I WAS IN MEXICAN ENOUGH BUT I WITHIN AMERICAN ENOUGH I'VE LIVED IN THE MIDDLE MOST OF MY LIFE BECAUSE THERE WAS NEVER ANY EDUCATION OR ANYTHING THAT REFERENCE MY JOURNEY OR MY PEOPLE. WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN VERY MANY IMMIGRANTS AND SO I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU AS A MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE BEING THE FIRST DEPORTED. AND THE FIRST UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT STANDING ON THIS FLOOR TODAY I DON'T WANT MY CHILDREN TO LIVE IN BETWEEN. AND NOT FEEL GUILTY TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT MEXICAN ENOUGH AND THEY ARE NOT AMERICAN ENOUGH BECAUSE THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO OUR JOURNEY IN ANY OF OUR HISTORY BOOKS. SO I STAND PROUDLY IN FRONT OF YOU IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL FOR MYSELF.AND FOR MY CHILDREN FOR MY CHILDREN'S CHILDREN I WANT THEM TO KNOW THEIR HISTORY AND KNOW THAT IT'S OKAY FOR US TO BE STANDING HERE TODAY AND BE A MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY WANT% TO DO. MY FAMILY BROUGHT US TO THIS COUNTRY TO THIS AMAZING COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITIES NEVER IN MY PARENT'S DREAMS THAT THEY IMAGINE BACK NOT ONLY ONE DAUGHTER BUT TWO DAUGHTERS SENATORS SUSAN RUBIO WOULD BE IN THIS HOUSE. AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN BE PART OF THIS HISTORY AS WELL SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING THIS UP AND I PROUDLY SUPPORT AB ONE OH ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAYES RUBIO MR GIPSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I WANT TO I WAS NOT PREPARED TO SPEAK BUT I FEEL LED TO DO THIS. AND I WANT TO COMMEND BY MY COLLEAGUE OF. FOUR ONE HAVING THE VISION TO BRING US TOGETHER BECAUSE I BELIEVE WITHOUT A VISION THE PEOPLE PERISH. AND CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA STANDS AT THE CUSP. OF BEING THE BEACON OF LIGHT IF THE OTHER STATES ALL ACROSS THIS THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO- MAKING SURE THAT WE DO NOT LOSE HISTORY. BUT THE TEACHER TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE I STAND HERE AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN AND THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. RALLY BEHIND AND SUPPORT THIS AUTHOR BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN THIS OFFCE WE BELIEVE IN ETHNIC STUDIES IT IS IMPORTANT WE TELL THE STORY AND NOT THE LET THE STORY'S NOT BE TOLD. AND SO SOMEONE WHO HALL SO YOU LOOK AT MY FAMILY MY FAMILY REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA IN THE DIVERSITY WHERE YOU HAVE YOU KNOW US US THE MORE IN A GRANDSON AND A LATINA. TWO GRANDDAUGHTERS AND SO WE ARE PROUD OF THAT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE GROWING UP- REFLECTED ALSO UNDERSTAND THEIR RICH CULTURE THEIR RICH HERITAGE. SO I KNOW THAT THIS AUTHOR WORKED HARD. I KNOW THAT WE SPENT SOME TIME TOGETHER TALKING IN HOTEL LOBBIES ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THIS OF THIS BILL- IN PAST BUT TODAY IS OUR DAY TO DAY WE CAN TURN A RE WRITE A NEW NARRATIVE IF FOR THIS STATE. AND I AM SO EXCITED TO LOOK ACROSS THE ROOM ON THAT SIDE AND SEEING ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES STAND UNITED BEHIND IT AUTHOR BECAUSE HE HEARS ABOUT GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I'M SO PROUD TO STAND AND WHEN I PUT MY MICROPHONE DOWN. I'M GOING TO STAND OVER THERE WITH HIM TO. DAVIS GIPSON. MISS CARILLO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I WANNA JUST BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF HISTORY AND THE POWER OF AN EMPOWER TEACHER. WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AT ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL. ASSEMBLY HEIGHTS. I HAD AN AMAZING HISTORY TEACHER WHO HAD ONE OF OUR STUDENTS HE WAS A FOOTBALL PLAYER. PICK AN ARGUMENT WITH HIM IN FRONT OF THE CLASS WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING. AND AFTER THE ARGUMENT OCCURRED AND HE SENT THE STUDENT TO THE- HE'S- HEY GUYS. HE SENT THE STUDENT TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE HE HAD AS RIGHT DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER WHAT WE SAW WHAT WE WITNESS. WE TURNED IN THAT PIECE OF PAPER TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM. AND HE VERY INTENTIONALLY STARTED RIPPING. ALL OF OUR STATEMENTS AS TO WHAT HAPPENED AND NOT OF THIRTY STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM. HE HAD. TWO PIECES OF PAPER LEFT MR GIBBS. AND HE SAID HISTORY IS TOLD BY THOSE IN POWER THERE WERE THIRTY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO WITNESSED THIS ARGUMENT AND OUT OF THE THIRTY WE'RE ONLY GOING TO TAKE TWO ACCOUNTS OF WHAT HAPPENED AS HISTORY. THAT IS THE HISTORY THAT HAS BEEN TAUGHT. ACROSS THIS NATION. AND ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THE STORIES OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE MISSING BECAUSE THEY'RE TOLD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE. THAT IS DIFFERENT. THAT DOESN'T COME FROM US AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE STORIES OF OUR COMMUNITY THE WASHINGTON POST HAD AN INCREDIBLE STORY. ABOUT A SLAVE NAMED YORK WHO MADE THE JOURNEY WITH LEWIS AND CLARK AND DISCOVERED AND SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE PACIFIC OCEAN. EVENAFTER THAT INCREDIBLE JOURNEY HE WAS NOT FREED. IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THE WASHINGTON POST OR NEWSPAPER TO SHARE THOSE STORIES EVERY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW BUT THE HISTORY OF THE STATE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE AND THAT IS WHY ETHNIC STUDIES IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT CRUCIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT. OF FUTURE CALIFORNIANS IN THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE IN THE FUTURE OF OUR NATION WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL WHICH HAS BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING IT'S FINALLY MOVING FORWARD AND WHY ALL OF US ARE STANDING HERE. SHOWING SOLIDARITY TO THE AUTHOR WHO HAS THIS HAS BEEN HIS PASSION AND WE ARE ALL IN SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT IT BECOMES A REALITY SO WE ALL RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK GOODNESS CARRILLO. SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. OUR DEBATE ON THE ITEM MISTER MEDINA YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I COULD DO MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPOKEN WE'RE STANDING BE EYEING ME IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE OH ONE. I THINK WE SEE TODAY- THE CULMINATION OF A LONG STRUGGLE A STRUGGLE OF FIFTY YEARS. WHEN STUDENTS AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE AT UC BERKELEY STOOD UP UNITED TOGETHER ACROSS RACIAL GROUPS ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO BE REPRESENTED WE NEED TO BE REPRESENTED IN THE CURRICULUM. THAT STRUGGLE OF FIFTY YEARS THAT STARTED AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE. AT CAL BERKELEY HAS OVER THE YEARS TRICKLE DOWN. AND STUDENTS FOR MANY MANY YEARS HAVE BEEN SAYING THE SAME THING AGAIN BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN STUDENTS AT EAST LA HIGH SCHOOLS. WALKED OUT. SAYING THE SAME THING. THAT WE NEED TO BE IN THE BOOKS IN THE HISTORY BOOKS WE NEED TO SEE OURSELVES REFLECTED IN THE HISTORY BOOKS THE WE NEED TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS COUNSELORS WHO LOOK LIKE US. THAT IS BEEN THE STRUGGLE OF FIFTY YEARS. AND TODAY AS WE ARE GOING TO PASS AB ONE OH ONE. WE ARE REAFFIRMING THOSE STRUGGLES. AND I WANT TO RECALL ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THAT STRUGGLE. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CLARITA. JESS THIS WEEK MONDAY A NEW STUDY A NEW STUDY THAT REAFFIRMED THE WORK DONE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE DIFFERENCE THAT ONE CLASS HAD ON STUDENTS STUDY CAME OUT MONDAY. AND FOUNDED THE BENEFITS THAT SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED STUDENTS WHO TOOK ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES IN NINTH GRADE LASTED THROUGHOUT THEIR HIGH SCHOOL RESULTING AND AS MANY HAVE POINTED OUT HIGHER ATTENDANCE HIGHER GRADUATION RATES INCREASED ENROLLMENT. IN COLLEGE AND THAT THEIR ACHIEVEMENT. WAS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAD NOT HAD ETHNIC STUDIES IN CLOSING I WANT TO REPEAT SOMETHING THAT I HEARD IN THE COMMENTS IN THE SENATE. AND THAT IS FOR THE MANY YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE IN THIS CHAMBER WE'VE CELEBRATE EVENTS PEOPLE. WHO HAVE DONE GREAT THINGS IN HISTORY.

ACCORDING ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THIRTY THREE BY FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER KAMLAGER ANAK LEADING THE CRIMINAL GANGS DR WEBER EMAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB THREE THREE THREE THE STEP FORWARD ACT BY SENATOR COM LONGER WHICH SEEKS TO BRING DUE PROCESS TO OUR GANG ENHANCEMENT STATUTE. OUR STATE GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE ROCKED WITH PROSECUTORIAL OVER REACH. IF THAT OVERREACH WASN'T SO WIDESPREAD WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY. AND THIS BILL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE VERY FIRST ROUND OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REFORM BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE. LET'S START WITH THEM DATA. GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE USED DISPROPORTIONATELY AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR AND HAVE RESULTED IN HARMFUL SYSTEMIC CRIMINALIZATION OF INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES. 92% OF PEOPLE WITH GANG ENHANCEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. NOTABLY THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT GANG ENHANCEMENTS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING CRIME OR PROTECTING COMMUNITIES. BUT THERE IS DATA THAT SHOWS THAT LONGER SENTENCES DO NOT MAKE US SAFER. OUR GANG ENHANCEMENT STATUE HAS VAGUE DEFINITIONS WEEK SANDERS APPROVED AND ARE PERHAPS THE MOST RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY PART OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AB THREE THREE THREE IS MERELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE ABSOLUTELY MUST GO MUCH FURTHER IF WE WANT TO PRESERVE ANY SENSE OF JUSTICE AND OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. AT ITS CORE THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT DUE PROCESS. IT IS TIME FOR US TO STOP RELYING ON ARCANE AND HARMFUL TOOLS LIKE FEAR BIAS. AND STEREO TYPES AND DEMAND THAT PROSECUTORS PROVE THE CHARGES THAT THEY LEVY AGAINST SOMEONE. AB THREE THREE THREE MAKE CHANGES TO THE LAW THAT WILL REDUCE PROSECUTORIAL OVERREACH BY MAKING THE STANDARDS FOR APPLYING A GANG ENHANCEMENT EVER SO SLIGHTLY MORE RIGOROUS. THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE THE APPLICATION OF GANG ENHANCEMENT IMPOSSIBLE. I WILL RESTATE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE THE APPLICATION OF GANG ENHANCEMENT IMPOSSIBLE. RATHER IT REQUIRES THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BE PROVIDED IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE WAS ACTUALLY COMMITTED ON BEHALF OF THE GANG. THE SENSIBLE CHANGES WILL ENSURE THAT GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE APPLIED TO ONLY THEMOST SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENSES. THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN SEVERAL AMENDMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. SOME TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE OPPOSITION AND OTHERS THAT REPRESENT A MIDDLE GROUND TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CORE CONCERNS STATED BY THE OPPOSITION. IN THE SENATE SHE HAS ADDED BACK THE PREDICATE OFFENCE OF BURGLARY. QUALIFIED ELIMINATES THE DEFINITION OF QUOTE BENEFIT MORE THAN REPUTATIONAL BY PROVIDING A LIST OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT A COMMON BENEFIT THAT IS MORE THAN REPUTATIONAL MAY INCLUDE. AMENDMENTS THAT WERE NOT ACCEPTED FOR THOSE THAT WERE VAGUE AND RAISE VALID CONCERNS THAT WOULD HAVE WATERED THE BILL DOWN TO SUCH AN EXTENT. THAT WOULD NO LONGER RETAIN ITS ORIGINAL INTENT. LET ME BE CLEAR. ONCE AGAIN AB THREE THREE THREE DOES NOT END GANG ENHANCEMENT. IT DOES NOT IMPACT THE LIVES OF GANG ENHANCEMENT AND IT DOES NOT PREVENT STREET LEVEL POLICE INVESTIGATIONS. IT'S SIMPLY ASK PROSECUTORS TO PROVE THE GANG CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST SOMEONE. IN OTHER WORDS IT ASKED PROSECUTORS TO DO THEIR JOB. THE SAME ARGUMENTS USED PRIOR TO PROVE A GANG ENHANCEMENT CAN STILL BE USE SO AS LONG AS THEY ARE GERMANE TO THE CHARGE. BY ADDRESSING SEVERAL DAMAGING EFFECTS OF QUOTE GANG EVIDENCE AND QUOTE AND TRY AT TRIAL AND NARROWING THE APPLICABILITY OF SUCH EVIDENCE. AB THREE THREE THREE TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR IT AT I'M DOING SOME OF THE HARM CAUSED BY CURRENT GANG ENHANCEMENT STATUES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WERE MISTER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE THREE THREE THIS STEP TOWARD ACT BY SENATOR TOM LOGGER. OF N. AS OUR COLLEAGUE SAN DIEGO STATE IS ON A CALM WATER. SPENT A LOT OF ENERGY AND TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT APPROPRIATE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE THAT- INSURE. THAT THIS IS GOING TO CLAMOR PROCESS BUT ALSO THAT THE BILL. IS STILL MEANINGFUL IN TERMS OF ITS GOALS. WE KNOW THAT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND NOWHERE. IS THAT MORE APPARENT. THEM OF GANG ENHANCEMENTS. OUR CURRENT GAME HAS TO STATUTES HAVE BIG DEFINITIONS WEEK STANDARDS APPROVED. WHAT'S THE MOST RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY PART. OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM I'VE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND DURING MY TIME AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND AS OP WE POINTED OUT BY A COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO 92% OF PEOPLE GETTING HAS TO CALIFORNIA. OF COLOR AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT GANG ENHANCEMENT LAWS ARE EFFECTIVE IN CURBING VIOLENCE OR MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. BY ADDRESSING SEVERAL DAMAGING EFFECTS OF GETTING EVIDENCE THE TRIAL AND NARROWING THE APPLICABILITY OF SUCH EVIDENCE AB THREE THIRTY THREE TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD UNDOING SOME OF THE HARM CAUSED BY CURRENT. GAME HAS BEEN STATUTES AB THREE THIRTY THREE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD TOWARDS A MORE EQUITABLE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH STILL IS ALLOW. A ALLOWS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO THEIR JOB THE KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE OUR RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SEVEN AMENDMENTS. THE FAMOUS KALRA MISTER BRYANT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES. GOT A RUNNING JOKE THE BLACK CAUCUS. WILL BE THREE OF US IN THE HALLWAY. OR THREE OF US IN THE MEMBERS LOUNGE OR THREE WAS AT THE AIRPORT WHEN YOU GET ON A PLANE. AND WE'LL JOKES. WATCH OUT WE WILL GET IN TROUBLE. IT WAS A FUNNY JOKE BECAUSE IN THIS BUILDING WILL LEGISLATIVE MISTAKE WITH LEGISLATIVE. BUT THAT JOKE IS ROOTED IN THE REALITY IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THAT REALITY IS THAT IF YOU LIVE IN A GANG INJUNCTION ZONE. AND THREE OF YOU ARE ON THE CORNER. YOU CAN BE PICKED UP. AND YOU CAN BE PUT ON THE GAME DATABASE. AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE GANG ENHANCEMENTS GOING ON TO EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE THAT YOU MAKE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. WHERE YOU'RE FROM AND WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. MCCAMLEY FROM SAN DIEGO SAID THAT GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY USED. ALL COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE DATA BEING NINETY TWO PERCENT. GETTING ENHANCEMENTS ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY USED ONLY ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IT'S A RACES FEATURE OF OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM THAT IS ROOTED. IN A VERY COMPLICATED HISTORY OF BLACK BROWN PORN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. AND WHAT THIS BILL. DOESN'T DO. IS SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IN THE FUTURE WHICH IS GET RID OF GANG ENHANCEMENTS ALL TOGETHER. ALL IT DOES IS RAISE THE THRESHOLD. THAT PROSECUTORS HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PLANE THAT I BELONG TO A GANG AND THEN I WAS IN A BLACK LEGISLATOR IN HIS DISTRICT AND WITH THREE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND AGAIN IT HAPPENS ALL. THE WE GOTTA BE MINDFUL WE PASS THIS BILL OUT OF THIS BODY ALREADY. WE SENT TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE THEY SENT IT BACK TO ITS MARKET CURRENT. LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE TO THE GOVERNOR. MR STONE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER REMEMBERS HIS BODY TALKS QUITE A BIT. ABOUT HOW WE CAN ROOT OUT SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC RACISM BUILT INTO. THE STATUTES AND- PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE. GETTING ENHANCEMENTS IS A VERY VERY. CLEAR OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND GET AT THE HEART OF IT. THE DATABASE THAT IS USED TO COMMUNITIES THAT. GETTING HAND SPENCER USED IN. ARE GREAT EXAMPLES. OF THE DIS. FUNCTION OF THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SET UP. WELL DOCUMENTED PROBLEMS WITH WITH THE DATABASE PEOPLE ON IT WHO'S NEVER SHOULD OFFEND PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET OFF OF IT AND THOSE THAT DRIVES SOME OF THE ENHANCEMENTS WE HAVE GOT. TO DRILL DOWN INTO OUR STATUTORY PROCESSES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING JUSTICE ON AN EQUITABLE LEVEL. THE POLICE YOUTH IN MY COMMUNITY WHO DEAL WITH GANGS QUITE A BIT AND ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT GANGS THEY KNOW. THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE INEQUITABLE APPLICATION OF OUR LAWS GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE A KEY INEQUITABLE APPLICATION OF OUR LAWS. AND THEY DON'T END UP WITH SAFER COMMUNITIES THEY CREATE MORE STRIFE ECONOMIC STRESS AND OTHER STRESSES IN THE COMMUNITIES THEN THEY BENEFITS. THIS BILL IN FACT DOES NOT GO ANYWHERE NEAR AS FAR AS THE PENAL CODE REVISION COMMISSION ASKED TO GO AND MANY OF US ON THIS FLOOR TODAY THINK THIS BILL DOES NOT GO. REALLY AS FAR AS IT NEEDS TO GO BUT I APPLAUD THE SENATOR FOR WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS TO TRY TO CRAFT SOMETHING THAT CAN MOVE THAT HOPEFULLY DOES MOVE. TODAY WITH YOUR CONCURRENCE IN THE SENATE AMENDMENTS THIS BILL HAS BEEN NARROWED DOWN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THE OPPOSITION HAVE WITHOUT ACTUALLY GETTING. WHAT THIS BILL IT IS A MINOR STEP FORWARD BUT A STEP FORWARD THAT IS NECESSARY I ASK FOR YOUR IBM. MISS BURKE QUE HAN YOUR REDLANDS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER WHEN THIS BILL WAS ON OUR FLOOR FIRST TIME. I STOOD UP AND I SPOKE ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO WORK. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS FOUNDED ON THE NOTION THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS FOUND GUILTY IS FOUND GUILTY BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT. WE MAKE THE JUROR OF PROSECUTORS HARD INTENTIONALLY WE DO NOT WANT TO TAKE FREEDOM AWAY FROM INDIVIDUALS. IN LESS WE ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE THEY'VE COMMITTED THE CRIME WITH WHICH THEY ARE CHARGED. THEIR INNOCENT TILL PROVEN GUILTY. AND YET WE HAVE THIS ELEMENT OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE GANG ENHANCEMENT. IN WHICH WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE AWAY. AT TIMES MORE THAN A DECADE OF SOMEONE'S LIFE WITHOUT MEETING THAT LOFTY BURDEN. MEMBERS I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY ON THIS FLOOR WHO BELIEVES IN THE AMERICAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. CAN BELIEVE THAT IS JUST OR RIGHT. THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL THAT SAYS IF YOU ARE TAKING SOMEONE'S YEARS AWAY FROM THEM YOU ARE DENYING THEM THE FREEDOM THEY DESERVE DUE PROCESS. AND ALL OF US TOOK AN OATH TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION AND I BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY. BY ENSURING THE DUE PROCESS IS IN THAT. BUT I WANT TO ADD AS WELL WE'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHICH IS NOT ONLY WITH THIS BILL REASONABLE WHEN IT PASSED THROUGH FIRST TIME IN ENSURING THAT. BUT THE AUTHOR IS GOING FURTHER SHE IS FURTHER AMENDED THE BILL SINCE WE SAW THE FIRST TIME. MANY OF US HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION WE COULD NEVER MEET THE STANDARD REPUTATIONAL HARM. AND IN THE NEW VERSION OF THE BILL SHE CLARIFY SPECIFICALLY THE MANY OF THE INSTANCES THAT ARE PROSECUTORS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT QUALIFIES REPUTATIONAL HARM. SHE HAS ENSURED THAT WHERE A GANG ENHANCEMENT MAY BE APPROPRIATE IT CAN BE POSSIBLE. IF THE PROSECUTOR MEETS THE BURDEN THE BURDEN THAT THEY SHOULD MEET EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY DENY SOMEONE THEIR FREEDOM. AND WITHOUT ASTER I VOTE. MISTER OF MEMBERS OF YOU'D LIKE PARTICIPATE PLEASE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW. MS BERNARD AFTER RECOGNIZE. YES MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I ROSE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND ASKED US TO GIVE THE SENATOR. TIME TO WORK ON THIS BILL AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF THE OPPOSITION. SHE'S NOT TO ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES OF THE OPPOSITION BUT SHE HAS ADDRESSED THE IMPORTANT ONES I LIKE TO REFER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM ARANDA. THERE IS THE FAIRNESS OF SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TO ENSURE AND IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY YEARS OF PEOPLE'S LIFE. I THINK IT'S- IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT PROSECUTORS NEED TO PROVE THAT THERE'S A CRIMINAL STREET GANG EXISTS. AND THAT THIS PERSON WAS A PART OF IT IN ORDER TO GET A ST GETTING ENHANCEMENT. I FEEL LIKE SHE'S DONE WHAT SHE NEEDED TO DO I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH ANY AMENDMENTS. THAT WILL CHANGE THIS BUT I THINK SHE'S DONE HER DUE DILIGENCE SHE'S AFTER. SHE'S DONE WHAT I AFTER TO DO AND WITHOUT- DR- I CAN NEVER SAY NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ON THE ITEM DR WEBER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO STOOD UP AND ADDRESSED AND SPOKEN. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY- LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES STATED.

THIRTY THREE SENATE BILL SIXSIXTY FOUR BY CENTER ALLAN AND ASHLEY THE HOSPICE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB SIX SIXTY FOUR WHICH IMPOSES A TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON NEW HOSPICE LICENSES UNTIL ONE YEAR AFTER THE COMPLETION OF A STATE AUDIT ON THE STATE'S HOSPICE LICENSURE OVERSIGHT. COLLEAGUES J. LIKE THIS YEAR EARLIER THIS YEAR- APPROVED AN AUDIT REQUEST TO IDENTIFY DEFICIENCIES AND RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HOSPICE LICENSURE AND OVERSIGHT PROCESS AND IN OUR STATE. THERE'S CONCERNS THAT CURRENT REGULATIONS FAILED TO ADDRESS THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE LICENSING OF HOSPICE CARE PROVIDERS SOME OF WHICH SEEM TO BE UNDERMINING THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE NOW WHILE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S AGING POPULATION IS GOING TO BE ON THE INCLINE IT'S GOING TO INCREASE FROM THE CURRENT FOURTEEN PERCENT. OF THE POPULATION 225% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION IN NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS AND THESE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING ABOUT THE RIGHT WAY. IN MAKING SURE THAT THE NEW ONES ARE GETTING SET UP APPROPRIATELY WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NECESSARY ADMINISTRATOR YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'LL RELATE TO WITH ALL OF US WE'VE HAD WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES WITH HOSPICE. AND THE DIGNITY THE END AND SELF ESTEEM THAT PROVIDES OUR LOVED ONES. NO THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION THAT IN THIS AREA IN THE AREA OF LOS ANGELES THERE WAS SEVERE PROBLEMS WITH FRAUD AND IT'S BEEN DOCUMENTED. BUT THIS IS A HEAVY HANDED APPROACH WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES IT'S A MORATORIUM ON LICENSURE GOING FORWARD. FOR MANY YEARSWELL IT'S ACTUALLY. UNTIL A YEAR AFTER THE AUDIT IS A PROVIDED OR TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN I BELIEVE- GOING FORWARD- THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. IN MY AREA ALONE WE HAVE A DESPERATE NEED FOR LICENSED HOSPICE PROVIDERS. THERE'S A SHORTAGE THIS IS CREATE ANOTHER SHORTAGE COMPOUNDED WE'VE HAD FRAUD AND OTHER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE DON'T STOP AND PROVIDE A MORATORIUM WE FIX IT AS WE GO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THESE SERVICES. NO ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO WHEN WE COME UP TO SACRAMENTO IS WE PROVIDE. WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS I PROMISE OF WILL DO NO HARM. THIS IS HARMFUL THIS HURTS THE ABILITY FOR PATIENTS TO HAVE THE DIGNITY AND SELF ESTEEM THAT THEY DESERVE IN THE LATTER PART OF THE LIFE AND THE CARE FOR THE FAMILIES THAT. ARE PROVIDED. I KNOW THIS THIS BILL WE GET THROUGH BUT I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN. LOOK FORWARD TO. MAKING SURE THAT OUR FAMILIES ARE PROVIDED FOR AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE. AS THEY DESERVE THIS IS A HEAVY HANDED APPROACH. AND I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN CURE IN THE NEXT SESSION- TO SOME KIND OF RESOLVE. I'M GONNA LAY OFF THIS BILL BECAUSE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A BIGGER DISCUSSION ABOUT TAKING CARE OF THE PEOPLE AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR- THEY WERE MADE IMPORTANT IN OUR LIVES. THANK YOU. CANISTER FRAZIER SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER NAZARIAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SURE THANK YOU I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM CONCORD- RELAYING HIS CONCERNS JUST SO YOU KNOW- THIS BILL DOES ALLOW NEW LICENSES FOR AREAS WITHOUT A LOT OF HOSPICE PROVIDERS IN AREAS WITH SHORTAGES- AND ALLOWS LICENSES THAT ARE ALREADY SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW. AT CDPH COLLEAGUES WITH THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS IS THE FACT THAT IN A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT NATIONWIDE. 87% OF HOSPICE CARE PROVIDERS VIOLATED AT LEAST ONE FEDERAL GUIDELINE IN CALIFORNIA THAT NUMBER IS NINETY FOUR PERCENT. 94% WE NEED TO STEM SOME OF THESE INCLUDE REOCCURRING ISSUES. AND ADDRESS THEM SO THAT FEDERAL DOLLARS AREN'T BEING WASTED WE KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT FRAUD WASTE AND ABUSE. THIS IS ONE MEASURE WHERE WE TEMPORARILY PUT SOMETHING ON HOLD REVIEW IT MOVE IT FORWARD. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU. BURKE WILL OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTED A THIRD OF A. ALL MEMBERS THOSE WHO DESERVE IT. CLERK WILL CLOSE THE ROLE IN TALLY THE VOTE HIGHS FIFTY SIX KNOWS FIVE THE MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS WE WILL TAKE A FILE ITEM NINETY TWO S. B. FOR THE CLERK WILL READ. SENATE BILL FOUR BY SOONER GONZALEZ AND OTHERS MEDICAL AND COMMUNICATIONS TO CLEAR THEIR ZERO STICK FOR COMPLETELY MISS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TO PRESENT S. B. FOR ON BEHALF OF SENATOR GONZALEZ. THIS BILL NOW CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR CONTINGENT NACHRICHT WITH AB FOURTEEN AFTER OUR BILLS HAVE BEEN NARROWED AND THE CONTENT SPLIT INTO THESE TWO VEHICLES. OF THE BILLS ARE NOW JOINED AS ONE INSEPARABLE PACKAGE I WILL SPEAK TO THE POLICY ON BOTH. OVER THE PAST TEN MONTHS CENTER GONZALEZ AND I WITH OUR TWO DOZEN COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE CO AUTHORED THE BILLS. HAVE PROVIDED MODERNIZE STANDARDS WHICH WILL BE UPDATED AS FCC STANDARDS EVOLVED. TO ADOPT A NEW SPEEDS AND TECHNOLOGY. AB FOURTEEN NOW HAS A SUNSET OF TEN YEARS ON THE EXISTING SURCHARGE. AB S. PHARMACIES ME SB FOUR NOW CONTAINS A CAP ON THE ANNUAL COLLECTIONS BY THE P. YOU SEE AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. WIRELINE CUSTOMERS MOSTLY SENIORS. RURAL AND LOW INCOME CONSUMERS WILL ACTUALLY SEE A DECREASED V. AS THE BILL REMOVES AN OVERDUE LOOPHOLE IMPLEMENTED BY THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. MEMBERS WHEN THIS BILL PASSED OUR HEALTH WITH SIXTY TWO BY PARTISAN CONSUMERS TO MEET ONE OF THE BY SIXTY TWO BY PARTISAN BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PER BOOK PROPOSED SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. THAT AMOUNT WAS REDUCED TO SIX BILLION ON THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL SB ONE FIFTY SIX. THE NEED HAS NOT BEEN REDUCE COLLEAGUES IT HAS INCREASED SINCE AB FOURTEEN PASSED THIS HOUSE IN MAY. WITH THE NEW LIMITS ON THE THIRD CHARGE EXTENSION THESE BILLS HAVE NEW CONSTRAINTS ON THE MONIES TO BE COLLECTED IN THE COMING YEARS. WHEN OPPONENTS OF THIS LEGISLATION ARGUED THAT THE MISSION HAS SOMEHOW BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THESE WERE THE SAME PARTIES WHO PROMISED TO SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTIVITY PRO PROBLEM. WITH AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US. THINK THAT THOSE PROMISES BASED ON THE RULES RINA GAVE NEGOTIATED WITH INDUSTRY WERE NEVER DELIVERED. NOW THOSE COMPANIES CLAIM WE NEED TO WORD SMITH NEW RULES THAT ALLOW PARTICIPATION BY LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBES IN COOPS TO FILL A HUGE GAP THEY WILLINGLY LEFT. IN OUR STATE. SO ASK YOURSELF HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO LEAVE LOW INCOME IN SMALL TOWN CALIFORNIANS BEHIND WELL WE PLAY BY THEIR RULES THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS STILL ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED PROJECTS BUT UNDER THESE BILLS ARE CONSTITUENTS WILL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR ONE SET OF PLAYERS IN INTERNET CONNECTIVITY TO DECIDE WHAT. PENCILS OUT. WE HAVE AN HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GENERATIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THE INTERNET SERVICES. TELEHEALTH JOB TRAINING EDUCATION SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION AND THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. THOSE THAT IS CRITICAL TO THE LIFE AND PROSPERITY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. POLITICS PLEASE JOIN ME IN IN VOTING IN FAVOR REST BEFORE AND ITS COMPANION AB FOURTEEN WHEN RETURNS TO THE ASSEMBLY. HOLLINGS HOW LONG DO WE WAIT. SERIOUSLY HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO WAIT. HOW WE GONNA TALK ABOUT IT WE ARE A STATE OF DOERS. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY. AND I THINK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. GIVE US AGUIAR-CURRY MISTER GIBSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH FOR PUSHING THIS BROADBAND BILL FOR TODAY. IT IT IT WILL ADVANCE THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO CLOSING THE DID THE VISUAL THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ALIGNED. WITH THE BUDGET THIS BILL WILL HELP THOSE THAT NEED IT THE MOST EXPRESSLY SMALL BUSINESSES FAMILIES BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION CAN COLLECT. IT IS EXPRESSLY IMPORTANT DURING THESE TIMES- THAT EVERYONE IS CONNECTED TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET LET ME SIMPLY SAY THAT WE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA'S COLLEAGUES WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA THAT IS CONNECTED AND WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA THAT IS NOT CONNECTED. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA THAT IS NOT CONNECTED THE CALIFORNIA IS NOT CONNECTED BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA THAT HAS LEFT BEHIND INTENT TO BE P. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA THAT'S LEFT BEHIND IS NOT CONNECTED IT TENDS TO BE THE ONES THAT WILL WIN A PANDEMIC. THOSE CHILDREN CANNOT DO DISTANCE LEARNING BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA THAT HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND- WHO CAN NOT. FUNCTION LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DO WHERE THERE IS LOOKING FOR A JOB SEARCHING THE INTERNET FOR OPPORTUNITIES. THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED JUST IMAGINE IF YOU YOURSELF. HAD NO CELL PHONE SERVICE. YOU CAN'T CALL YOUR LOVED ONES YOU CAN'T CONNECT TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD WHAT IS THE MATCH YOU ON A DESERT ISLAND AND YOU HAVE NO FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITH DOT THAT'S THE REALITY THAT PEOPLE ARE FACED WITH DAY IN AND DAY OUT. IN CALIFORNIA THE FIFTH WORLD ECONOMY THESE INDIVIDUALS FEEL LEFT BEHIND AND LEFT OUT IN MOST CASES THEY FEEL LEFT FOR DEAD. AND SO THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN RE WRITES A NARRATIVE IN CALIFORNIA THE MOVE ALL OF CALIFORNIA FORWARD. WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR WE CAN'T WAIT TWO YEARS WE HAVE TO DO THIS NOW THE TIME IS NOW FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE THERE THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING. SB FOUR WE'VE HEARD FROM MARK OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM WINTER WHO HAS LABORED ON TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH THE COALITION- TO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE OF EVERYONE- I'M COMMITTED AND EVERYONE BROUGHT TO A CONNECTIVE ITTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE ON SENATE BILL FOR. THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BEFORE. YOU KNOW I'VE FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN ON THIS FLOOR ADVOCATING FOR BROADBAND ACCESS THIS IS AN ACCESS ISSUE. IT'S AN ACCESS ISSUE FOR PEOPLE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IT'S AN ACCESS ISSUE IN IN IN COMMUNITIES LIKE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM COMPTON RIGHT REPRESENTS THERE. ARE CARS EXCUSE ME CARSON- THIS IS AN ACCESS ISSUE THIS IS THE EXTENSION. OF A FEE NOT A NEW FEE IT'S AN EXTENSION OF A FEE MOST PEOPLE WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT'S EVEN ON THEIR BILL IT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE PROCESS WHEN WE STARTED LOOKING WE LOST OUR LOOKING AT THE AT THE BUDGET BILL FOR- FOR BROADBAND AND OTHER SUPPORTING BILLS THAT GO A LONG WAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. TO KEEP THIS GOING TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE. OF BROADBAND FOR EVERYONE IN THIS STATE. COLLEAGUES I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND ALSO TO SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN WHEN IT COMES BACK ON CONCURRENCE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD STRUMMER'S YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TO SUPPORT A S. B. TO END AB FOURTEEN WHEN IT COMES BACK TO OUR FLOOR. REASONS WHY IS BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THIS INCLUDES THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND WE TALK ABOUT RURAL COMMUNITIES MANY TRAVEL RESERVATIONS LIVE IN THE DEEPEST RURAL AREAS THAT STILL DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS. TO BROADBAND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CLOSURES OF SCHOOLS DURING THE PANDEMICS AND WE WENT TO BROADBAND IN MANY PLACES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO YOU KNOW THAT MANY INDIAN RESERVATIONS THE WAY THEY ACCOMMODATED THAT WAS HAVING PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY DR BOOKS TO DIFFERENT HOUSES THROUGHOUT THE RESERVATIONS. THAT WAS THE WAY THAT THEY HAD THE BROADBAND THERE WAS NO WAY TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE INTERNET THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME WILL BRING THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT A LOT OF THESE PIECES OF LEGISLATION FOR THE FIRST TIME MOVING FORWARD. THIS IS A BILL THAT NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO NEED TO ADDRESS BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BROADBAND FOR ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET'S REMEMBER CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE AND THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN THE TRIBAL FEDERAL INDIAN RESERVATIONS. THERE ARE STILL SO RURAL THAT MANY TIMES IT TAKES TWO HOURS TO GET TO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE MARKETS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THESE ARE AREAS THAT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE AS A STATE LEGISLATURE AND I WANT TO THANK OF SENATOR GONZALEZ IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CECILIA AGUIAR-CURRY FOR BRINGING THESE ISSUES FORWARD. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INCLUDING WE ARE INCLUDING ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SUPPORT THESE TYPES OF BILLS THAT STARTS TO BALANCE THAT APPROACH OF EQUITY WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY ALL THE TIME ON THIS FLOOR. BUT NOW IN FRONT OF US WE HAVEN'T EQUITY TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE IN THE TRAVEL COMMUNITIES SHARE ONE IT'S AN FOR. IT WON'T TALKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AND THAT'S BROADBAND ACCESS FOR ALL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I SUPPORT AB FORTY WHEN IT COMES BACK. SO I ASK FOR YOUR ARE VOTE BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WE'RE INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT ALL. THANK YOU MYSTERONS MYSTERY OF US YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AS WELL RISE IS VICE CHAIR OF A THE CALIFORNIA LATINO. LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS ON YOU KNOW I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL FOR WHICH IS A TOP ON THE PRIORITY FOR CAUCUS. I WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH AND SO MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES ON THIS FLOOR FROM. WINTERS IN COACHELLA I'D TORRANCE AND LOS ANGELES AND I'VE DONE WORK IN THIS SPACE. AND THIS LEGISLATION. WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY RESIDENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND. IN PARTICULAR THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT OUR MOST UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE ARE. YOU SOME OF OUR MOST- ARE DISADVANTAGED AREAS CAN FINALLY ACCESS HIGH SPEED INTERNET THROUGH GRANT FUNDING. AS HAS BEEN EMPHASIZED ALREADY BROADBAND IS NO LONGER AN OPTION FOR HOUSEHOLDS TO CONSIDER PURCHASING IT'S AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY IN OUR SOCIETY. AND WITH THAT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. THANK YOU MR THIS MISTER SANTIAGO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER THINKING MAN'S BIGGER NOT WE BEGAN THE YEAR. TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS THE YEAR THAT WE DO BROADBAND. AND WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE THE BILL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. THIS IS THE PIECE A BIG PIECE OF GETTING BROADBAND CONNECTION DONE ACCOSTED CALIFORNIA. NOW I'VE WE'VE TALKED AMONGST EACH OTHER INDIVIDUALLY AND FOLKS SAY WELL WE JUST DID SI BILLION IS NOT ENOUGH. BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THAT SIX BILLION WHAT'S- THERE WERE THREE POINT TWO FIVE. FOUR WITH CONSIDER THE MIDDLE MILE. AND WE THINK ABOUT THAT THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THE HIGHWAY. THE LOAN LOSS PROGRAM. THAT THAT USE THE OTHER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. THOSE ARE KIND OF THE OFF RAMP IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. AND THEN THERE'S THE KIND OF THE MEAT AND POTATOES OF WHAT'S GOING TO GET US CONNECTED IN COMMUNITIES AND THAT LEFT US WITH ABOUT TWO BILLION. WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY NOW THIS U. P. LET'S NOT THIRTY SEVEN APPLICATIONS. AND THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. SO THE MONIES WE PASSED WERE A STEP TOWARD A BIG STEP BUT ONLY A IN AN INVESTMENT ONLY A DOWN PAYMENT FOR THE REAL WORK AHEAD OF US. I WOULD BE GETTING THIS PANDEMIC WE ALL KNEW THAT THE INTERNET WAS IMPORTANT. BUT WHAT WE SAW WE KIDS HAD TO GO HOME AND DISTANCE LEARNING BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE INTERNET ACCESS OR ADEQUATE INTERNET ACCESS. IT WHAT WE SAW IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE. WITH CHILDREN SITTING OUTSIDE OF A FAST FOOD PLACES TO CAPTURE INTERNET. WHAT WE SAW ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WHAT WHAT WAS THAT WAS THAT WHETHER YOU'RE RICH OR POOR WE'LL URBAN. THERE WAS THERE WAS A NECESSITY FOR THE INTERNET JUST TO HAVE A BASIC EDUCATION. AND THE MANY WERE LEFT BEHIND. NOW SOME OF US ARE FROM URBAN AREAS AND SO WE'VE ALWAYS MADE THE CASE FOR URBAN AREAS. BUT WE GOT TO DRIVE UP AND DOWN THE STATE BECAUSE KOGAN PREVENTED US FROM GETTING ON PLANES WE REALLY QUICKLY FOUND OUT THAT WE COULDN'T HAVE. A LOT OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS UP AND DOWN THE NINETY NINE UP AND DOWN THE FIVE. AND I WAS AN INCONVENIENCE BUT I COULD IMAGINE LIVING. IN ANY OF THESE AREAS AND NOT HAVING ANY WAY TO CONNECT. ANYTIME OF THE DAY. BUT WHAT WE ALSO FOUND IN URBAN AREAS. I'LL TRY TO DISTANCE LEARNING. IS THE IMPORTANCE OF A TELEHEALTH REPORTS THE CONNECT THE LOVED ONES THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT IT MEANT NOW TO WORK FROM HOME. SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS THIS HAD HIT IN IMPACTED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WORSE THAN ANY OTHER COMMUNITIES BUT WHAT WE FOUND OUT THAT IMPACTED EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS WORK DONE AND LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT IT WE'VE JUST BEGUN TO PUT A DOWN PAYMENT. ON THE MONEY IS NEEDED TO CONNECT. THIS WILL ACTUALLY FULFILL THAT CONVERSATION THAT WE BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE- YEAR THAT SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO BROADBAND INTERNET CONNECTION FOR ALL. BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT MORE WORK. AND WHAT THIS ALLOWS US TO DO BECAUSE REMEMBER THE FEDERAL FUNDS IN. TWENTY TWENTY SIX. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE CONNECTION TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD EVERY SMALL BUSINESS. AT EVERY MEDICAL FACILITY ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET DONE THAT WE SET ARE SO IMPORTANT. THAT WE WILL SAID IN SPEECHES THAT EVERYBODY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR THERE'S STILL IMPORT. IF WE DON'T GET THIS DONE. CONTINUE THAT WORK FOR THE NEXT DECADE. AND HOPEFULLY IF THIS GETS OUT. AND A COMPANION BILL GETS OUT. WELL NOT ONLY FULFILLED A DOWN PAYMENT BUT WE WILL WE WILL HAVE INVESTED TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SAID THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US. NOT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. M. AND I'M GONNA LOOK AT LONGER BUT THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE WERE DEVASTATED WITH THE INABILITY FOR KIDS TO GET DISTANCE LEARNING BECAUSE IT WAS JUST NO CONNECTION. BUT THEY WERE ALSO DEVASTATED WITH PEOPLE TO HAVE THE INABILITY TO VISIT A DOCTOR. OR NURSE. NOW WILL NEW ABOUT TELEHEALTH. BUT PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THE WAY TO DO IT. I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH. THAT THAT THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SINGLE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE DO. AND THESE COUPLE OF YEARS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS FINALLY TO CONNECT EVERYONE. AND THIS IS PART OF THAT SO I WOULD URGE A YES VOTE. FOR THAT WE DON'T FALL SHORT OF A DOWN PAYMENT BUT WE ACTUALLY INVEST THE MONEY THAT ARE NEEDED TO FINALLY CONNECT CALIFORNIA- I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANKS SANTIAGO MISS AMERICA TWO G. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I- WANT TO JOIN. TO URGE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE AS WELL AS THE COMPANION BILL. WE JUST HEARD FROM A OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WHO I WORKED WITH ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM COACHELLA. AND WE DID SUCCEED IN. GETTING THE THREE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE MIDDLE MILE INFRASTRUCTURE SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE TERMINOLOGY THE MIDDLE MILE VERSUS THE LAST MILE I MEAN THE MIDDLE MILE IS LIKE. IT'S LIKE TO FREEWAYS THAT THE CONNECT THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF OUR STATE BUT HOW DO WE CONNECT FROM THE FREEWAYS TO THE INDIVIDUAL HOMES THAT'S WHERE THE LAST MILE COMES INTO PLAY THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO TO WHAT. AGAIN ARE CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES SAID YOU KNOW I WOULD PUT IT THIS WAY THAT. BROADBAND. CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. IF YOU CAN'T CONNECT. TO THE INTERNET CHILDREN ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CLASSROOM FROM THE VIRTUAL CLASSROOM IF YOU CAN'T CONNECT YOUR WORKPLACE YOU ARE EXCLUDED FROM YOUR WORKPLACE AND SO THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH WE GOT THAT SIGNIFICANT SIX BILLION DOLLAR FUNDING IN THE IN THE BUDGET THAT GOES TO THE OVERALL. BROUGHT IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE THE BACKBONE OF THE STATEWIDE- A BROADBAND NETWORK BUT WE NEED THAT LAST MY CONNECTION TO ACTUALLY GET INTO THE HOUSEHOLD TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIGITAL DIVIDE SO LIKE TO JOIN ALL MY COLLEAGUES IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MISS AMERICA T. MR VOEPEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN OPPOSITION AND NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT. NOBLE GOOD THIS BILL AS A MATTER OF TIMING FOR ME. SIMPLE TIMING I THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL I'D LIKE TO SEE IT GO NEXT YEAR. AND AS THE HONORABLE. CHAIR OF BUDGET SAID WE'VE GOT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. SO WHAT I ASK IS PEOPLE WILL CONSIDER THE TIMING. LET'S USE THE SIX BILLION WE ALSO HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND RESCUE PLAN. LET'S LOOK AT THAT MONEY WE ALSO HAVE A DRY ENORMOUS I MAKE WORDS UP OKAY. TRY NORMA'S SURPLUS NOW I ALSO WRAP THIS UP WOULD LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE. THIS YOU CAN CALL A TAX YOU COULD CALL THE FEE BUT IT'S STILL A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR EXTENSION ON PEOPLE'S PHONE BILLS RIGHT NOW THE PHONE BILLS. LOADING THE MODEL NUMBERS HERE TWENTY FIVE POINT 669% ARE THESE FEES AND TAXES. AND THEY IMPACT LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR IT'S A EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IMPACT ON YOUR POCKETBOOK. SO THOSE ARE MY POINTS I ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE. AND THEN NEXT YEAR I'LL BE YES ALL THE WAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR VOEPEL WITHOUT OBJECTION I THINK I. NORMAN IS A WORD. MS CLARK SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER A MEMBERS I RISE TO SUPPORT S. B. FOR. BY MY COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE AND ALSO TO SUPPORT- MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE FLOOR WHO HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY ON NOT ONLY BROADBAND THIS YEAR BUT FOR MANY YEARS. WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A HISTORIC INVESTMENT THIS YEAR. AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE DOLLARS MEANS SOMETHING WHEN IT COMES TO CONNECTING NOT ONLY STUDENTS AND CHILDREN BUT ELDERS AND SENIORS AND VULNERABLE AREAS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONNECTED. BUT I DO WANT TO CAUTION US AS I'VE BEEN APPOINTED TO THE MIDDLE MILE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THAT YES. GAINING THESE FUNDS IN THE CAST OF FUNDS IS IMPORTANT. FOR THAT LAST MILE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO DO MORE TO FOCUS ON THE P. YOU SEE MAKING SURE THAT THEY MOVE APPLICATIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER THAT THEY ARE NOT HOLDING APPLICATIONS FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS ON END SO THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO INVEST WE SEE THAT INVESTMENT MOVING FORWARD AS A FREE WAY IF WE ARE CLOGGED UP BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC LITERALLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS. THE LAST THING THAT I WANT TO SEE. MEMBERS I APOLOGIZE. BUT IS ANOTHER HIGH SPEED RAIL SCENARIO WHERE WE MAKE AN INVESTMENT AND WE DON'T SEE THAT INVESTMENT COME FORWARD. ALL OF US WERE STUNNED WHEN WE SAW THOSE TWO YOUNG GIRLS SITTING OUT IN FRONT OF A TACO BELL. A PICTURE SPEAKS A MILE THOUSAND WORDS. AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED THIS CONNECTIVITY BUT LET ME BE CLEAR AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER EQUITY. ANY QUALITY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MEANS WE MUST INVEST IN THE AREAS THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED FIRST. WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONNECTIONS GET MOVE FORWARD WITH THE FUNDING WE HAVE AND THAT THE P. YOU SEE IS ACCOUNTABLE AND MOVE SWIFTLY AND THAT'S WHY SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE SIX BILLION IS A HUGE INVESTMENT. BUT IT IS NO INVESTMENT AT ALL IF WE CANNOT MOVE THESE PROJECTS FORWARD IN A TIMELY MANNER. I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT SB FOUR. THANK YOU OF COURSE OF A MR MAYS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I CAN GET THERE ON THIS BILL I'M JUST NOT SURE I CAN GET THERE ARE RIGHT NOW- AND HERE'S HERE'S WHY- WE KNOW THAT WE NEED A MORE ACCESS TO BROADBAND ESPECIALLY IN OUR RURAL AREAS BUT- WHEN WE WENT THROUGH. OUR OF OUR BROADBAND WORKING GROUP JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP OF HOUSE THE ALLOCATION TO RURAL AREAS VERSUS URBAN. AND COUNTIES LIKE SAN BENITO COUNTY AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS URBAN I COUNTIES WHEN IN FACT A BIG CHUNK OF THOSE OF THOSE COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY RULE IN THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL. ABOUT A SAYS THAT THEY ARE THEIR URBAN COUNTIES I'VE ASKED FOR A BUSINESS PLAN IN FACT IT WAS THE MEMBER FROM HAYWARD IN. THAT HAD SAID THAT SHOWS THE BUSINESS PLAN. IF ANYBODY IF YOU OF LOOKING AT THIS BILL. CAN READ IN THERE WHAT IMPACT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ON YOUR DISTRICT I'D LOVE TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IMPACT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ON MY DISTRICT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF MY DISTRICT THAT NEED. MORE BROADBAND A NEED- THERE UNDERSERVED AND MANY PEOPLE ARE UNSERVED AND WE NEED TO GET FUNDS TO THEM WHEN YOU BUILD THAT CAPACITY I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS IT WHAT ARE WE BUYING HERE. THERE IS A SURCHARGE FINE I'M FINE WITH THE SURCHARGE. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BUY. SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I CAN GET THERE I JUST CAN'T GET THERE. RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES MISSED BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. BEFORE AND THE COMPANION BILL THAT WILL MOVE FORWARD AND IN SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DO A QUERY FOR. VOICING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IN TWO THOUSAND TEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AS HE TALKED ABOUT THIS THING CALLED BROADBAND AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO USE. BROADBAND TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO HOUSING TO EDUCATION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ID OUR PARTY AS THE QUESTION WHEN WILL WE DO THIS THE TIME IS NOW WE'VE BEEN SUFFERING WITHOUT YOU FOR YEARS FOR DECADES IF YOU WILL WITHOUT EQUITABLE ACCESS TO BROADBAND IT IS THE KEY TO OUR DIGNITY IS IT IT IS THE KEY. TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IT IS THE KEY TO ACCESS TO HOUSING TO EDUCATION TO EVERYTHING THAT WE STAND FOR AND THIS CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY WHAT ARE WE BUYING WE ARE BUYING DIGNITY NOW WE ARE BUYING ACCESS NOW. AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE OUR COLLEAGUES TO BE ABLE TO BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS BONTA. MISTER CA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE MATTER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. BY OUR COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE STATED WHY. THIS BILL IS SO CRITICAL. THERE ARE SOME VERY- BASIC AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS- IF THIS BILL THE COMPANION BILL DO NOT PASS AND MANY OF YOU HAVE ARTICULATED WHAT THOSE ARE CHILDREN SCHOOLS. BUSINESSES MAKING THEIR TRANSACTIONS PEOPLE ACCESSING HEALTH CARE- THAT IS SO CRITICAL TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE MEDICALLY UNDER SERVED AND THE LST GOES ON AND ON AND ON I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE. TO COLLEAGUES WHO RAISED HER MIKE AND SAID. I CAN SUPPORTERS BUT NOT TODAY. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT- WE APPRECIATE YOUR COURAGEOUS STANDS THERE ARE MANY ON THIS FLOOR. WHO PROBABLY DO NOT DARE TO RAISE OR MIKE AND ARTICULATE WHY THEY DON'T SUPPORT THIS BILL. IS IN THE FACE OF THE CHILDREN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THOSE WHO ARE IN DIRE NEED OF ACCESSING HEALTHCARE SERVICES. AND NOT RECOGNIZING THE WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO NOT JUST THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED PRIOR TO THE SUMMER BREAK BUT THE SENSUAL COMPLIMENTS ON POLICY AND INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS INTERNET SERVICES FOR EVERYONE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORK ISN'T A ONE AND DONE. AND THAT THERE ARE AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT THAT WE BEGIN WORKING ON. TODAY OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY FOR SERVICES. WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO STILL IN THE FINING THE RURAL AND URBAN AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE INTENTIONAL. WHERE THEY ARE INVESTED IN THAT WE GET THE OUTCOMES THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE. THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THE UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY DEFINITIONS ARE ALSO CLEARLY DEFINED. FOR THOSE SAME PURPOSES THERE ARE MORE FEDERAL FUNDS. THAT ARE POTENTIALLY COMING OUR WAY TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN. ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT THE LOCAL FOLKS ARE GOING TO HAVE AS WE ARE EMPOWERING THEM. TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STATE TO DELIVER. BROADBAND SERVICES TO THEIR AND OUR CONSTITUENTS AND YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IS THE NEED. TO INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC HOUSING. THE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC HOUSING WHERE MANY BROWN BLACK AND POOR WHITE FOLKS LIVE. AND ENSURE THAT THEY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CRITICAL SERVICE. MEMBERS WE DID THIS A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE CALL THE INTERNET FOR ALL. AND THAT WAS THE SAME GROUP THAT- WORKED ON SOME OF THIS WORK TODAY AND WE KNEW THAT VAN. THAT THAT WAS NOT ACHIEVING THE ULTIMATE GOAL. WE BY THE GRACE OF A PANDEMIC WE'RE BLESSED WITH SOME DOLLARS. TO BE ABLE TO PUT FORWARD ON WHAT BECAME ONE OF THE CLEAREST. NEEDS THAT WE HAD. IN THE ONSET OF THIS COLVIN NINETEEN SHUT DOWN THAT REQUIRED US TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN AT HOME CHANGE OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND REALLY HOW WE DO BUSINESS PERHAPS. FOR A LONG LONG TIME TO COME. MY HOPE IS THAT THOSE WHO DIDN'T RAISE THEIR MIKE AND WILL HAVE BEEN PULLING WITH THE IDEA OF NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL STAYING OFF THE BILL. THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN THAT YOU CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT ON THIS ASSEMBLY FLOOR. THANK YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE CONNECTIVE ITTY FOR THE PURPOSE OF A- GOOD QUALITY EDUCATION. THANK YOU THINK ABOUT THE OLD FOLKS WHO LIVE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE THAT REQUIRE INTERNET SERVICES TO ACCESS MEDICAL ATTENTION. AND THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT YOU ALL CLAIM TO REPRESENT AND ADVOCATE FOR. ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO CONTINUE THEIR BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS REGARDLESS OF A WORLD PANDEMIC. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU DIG DEEP INSIDE AND THINK ABOUT THOSE FOLKS THAT I JUST HIGHLIGHTED. AND REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF YOUR DISTRICT AND NOT THE SPECIAL INTERESTS OF SACRAMENTO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR GARCIA MISTER SATTAR YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. SO I OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE THIS ISSUE WE'RE HAVING A DEBATE. IN THIS DEBATE ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR NOT. BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. AGREES THAT IT'S GOOD THE DEBATE IS HOW WE PAY FOR IT. ARE WE GOING TO MAKE THOSE VERY PEOPLE THAT WERE SAYING ARE UNDERSERVED ARE WE GONNA MAKE THEM PAY FOR THIS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE HAVE A WE HAVE AGAIN THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND I HEARD WE HAD A LITTLE EXTRA MORTGAGE A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT. THAT WE CAN MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE A BUNCH OF TRAILER BILLS TOMORROW THIS CAN BE INCLUDED IN ONE OF THOSE IF WE WANTED IT SO BADLY. IT IS IMPORTANT. IT IS A PRIORITY. OUR KIDS DO MATTER. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US AGREES WITH THAT WHAT WE DON'T AGREE WITH IS MAKING THEM PAY FOR IT. WE NEED TO WE NEED TO USE THE INVESTMENT. WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE AND INVESTED IN THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SO FOR PETE'S SAKE DON'T MAKE THEM PAY FOR IT. WE PAY FOR WE'VE ALREADY PAID FOR. WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY FOR IT. IT CAN BE DONE TOMORROW WELL NOT NOW BUT- IF THAT WAS THE PRIORITY IT COULD HAVE BEEN FUNDED. THROUGH OUR OUR BUDGET TRAILER BILL. AND WE DIDN'T DO IT. SO THAT'S NOT THEIR FAULT WE SHOULD BE SENDING THEIR PARENTS A BILL AND BY THE WAY EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT WHEN YOU START ADDING UP ALL THE TAXES AND FEES ON INTERNET. PRETTY MUCH THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT ANYWAY SO THEY WON'T HAVE BROADBAND. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE IS HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT. SO THAT THEY CAN BE INCLUDED. SO THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE THE CAR DRIVE THE COST UP SO MUCH OF THEIR PARENTS CAN'T EVEN AFFORD IT. AND THEN THE ALL HAVE ACCESS TO IT. WE NEED TO MAKE THAT OF THAT INVESTMENT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR WITH THE MONEY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK THE DEBATE REALLY SHOULD BE. AND INSTEAD IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE THE- WORK WE'RE DEBATING THAT IF WE DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR THIS IT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE KIDS AND WE DON'T. REALLY WANT TO ENTER THE BROADBAND BROUGHT TO THEM WHEN THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL. WHAT'S TRUE IS. HOW DO WE PAY FOR WE HAVE THE MONEY. WE SHOULD HAVE PUT THAT MONEY TO WORK DOING EXACTLY THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR EVERYONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FATTO SEEING HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU MAKE THOSE. I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE THE SPOKE TODAY FOR AGAINST THE BILL. AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID BEFORE THE TIME IS NOW. YOU KNOW- THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS THAT HAPPEN OUT OF SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE THE YOU DON'T MAY MAYBE THOUGHT ABOUT. YOU KNOW WE HAD OUR CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND DO SOME REALLY SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS THIS PAST COUPLE YEARS. BUT THE THING THAT I WANT TO KEEP COMING BACK BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP THROWING IT IN MY FACE IS THE SIX POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER DONE A INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT. MANY OF YOU'VE DONE ONE. MAYBE MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVEN'T THEIR EXPENSIVE. AND HOW YOU GO OUT TO BID WHAT THEY ARE TODAY IS NOT WHAT THEY'RE GOING INTO BEING. SO THE SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO ME IS JUST THE START. JUST FOR INSTANCE TO DAY THEY'RE SAYING YOU CAN NOT GET FIBER. THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS BROKEN MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING A BILL ABOUT MAKING FIBER HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR WHATEVER THE CASE MIGHT BE A FIVE FOR THE PRICE OF FIBERS GOING TO GO UP THERE FOR THE PRICE OF OUR PROJECTS GOING TO GO UP. SO THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. LET'S NOT BE LEFT HIGH AND DRY ALONG THE WAY. YOU KNOW EXTENDING THE EXISTING FEE WILL STABILIZE AND MINIMIZE USER COST LONG TERM. BECAUSE OTHERWISE USERS WILL HAVE TO RELY HEREBY YEAR ON THE STATE APPROVING IT THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND. THAT OR CREATING A NEW SURCHARGE IN THE FUTURE TO PLAY CATCH UP ON THE UNMET NEEDS. POLITICS LET'S NOT PLAY THE GAME. LET'S DO RECKLESS TO THIS IS JUST GET IT DONE. AND ARE THERE GOING TO BE SOME OF THE STEPS PROBABLY LET'S FACE IT. BUT I'M TELLING YOU WE HAVE A GROUP SUCH AS RC RC THAT WANT TO START IMPLEMENTING THAT ARE PUTTING TOGETHER IMPLEMENTATION PLANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. WE'VE GOT GROUPS THAT ARE ONE ENTREPRENEURS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. WHERE PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO LET'S BE THE LEADER THERE'S SOME RISKS WE HAVE TO TAKE. WHEN I CAME ON TO THIS FLOOR I KNEW I'D HAVE TO TAKE SOME RISKS THAT'S WHAT THIS JOBS ABOUT. SO LET'S NOT FORGET OUR CONSTITUENTS PLEASE. LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT THE KIDS RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO GET. GO THROUGH COBRA RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GO THROUGH CLASSES AND THEY CAN'T DO INDEPENDENT STUDY RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE INTERNET AT HOME. AND THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR ABA UNTIL ALL THE BILL PLATFORMS TAKING CARE OF. EVERYBODY THIS IS AFFECTING SO MANY PEOPLE. I CAN GO ON FOR A LONG TIME AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN PASSION ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT TO LOOK BEHIND. WE NEED TO DO IT NOW. S. RIVAL CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE MEMBERS VOTED DESERVE A. ALL MEMBERS THOSE WHO DESIRED OF A.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I AM VERY EXCITED COLLEAGUES TO INTRODUCE A BILL THAT- HAS BEEN LITERALLY SAT ON MY DESK AT THE END OF SESSION LAST YEAR AND WE CAN BRING FORWARD IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT BILL- SB SIXTY TWO EXPANDS AND STRENGTHENS ENFORCEMENT OF WAGE THEFT IN THE GARMENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY ENSURING THAT RETAILERS CANNOT USE LAYERS OF CONTRACTING TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE LAW. FASHION BRANDS HAVE CREATED POVERTY WAGES THROUGH THE UNREALISTIC PRICING OF GARMENTS YET HAVE NO LEGAL LIABILITY FOR THE EXPLOITATION WHICH OCCURS. A REPORT BY THE UCLA LABOR CENTER DOCUMENTED THAT THE GARMENT INDUSTRY AS HAVING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF WAGE THAT VIOLATION BY INDUSTRY AND SECOND HIGHEST BY OCCUPATION. COMBINED WITH AN ARCHAIC SYSTEM OF PAIN PIECE RATE BASED ON UNATTAINABLE PRODUCTION TARGETS MINIMUM WAGE IS ALWAYS OUT OF REACH FOR THESE WORKERS. AS SUBCONTRACTORS SKIRT THE LAW THOUSANDS OF GARMENT WORKERS ARE LEFT UNABLE TO RECOVER STOLEN WAGES WHILE RETAILERS CONTINUE TO PROFIT. TO ENSURE RETAILERS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND GARMENT WORKERS ARE MADE WHOLE AND PROTECTED FROM WAGE THEFT SB SIXTY TWO WELL LIMON A PIECE RATE TO ENSURE WORKERS ARE PAID WAGES FOR ALL OF THEIR TIME SPENT WORKING WHILE STILL ALLOWING FOR INCENTIVE BASED BONUSES. AND EXPAND MY ABILITY FOR WAGE VIOLATIONS CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AS TO THE IDENTITIES OF THE BRANDS BASED ON GARMENT WORKERS TESTIMONY AND EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZES THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO INVESTIGATE INSIGHT BRAND GUARANTORS. TO BE CLEAR RECENT AMENDMENTS LIMIT LIABILITY. FOR GRAND FOR BRAM AGAIN TEARS TO ONLY WAGES NOT DAMAGES AND PENALTIES. OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY FASHION INDUSTRY BUSINESSES HAVE ENDORSED THIS BILL AND ARE LEADING THE CHARGE FOR AN ETHICAL WORKPLACE IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS TO MAKE THE COUNTRY'S MASK RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR AS LITTLE AS TWO CENTS APIECE. SB SIXTY TWO IS ALLEGE THEY WOMEN'S PRIORITY BILL THAT WILL ALLOW LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PARTY BILL THAT WILL ALLOW WORKING WOMEN TO REGAIN MILLIONS OF STOLEN. DOLLARS IN WAGES AND WILL HELP THEIR FAMILIES THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THE TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE SUBSIDIZED THIS RAMPANT WAGE THEFT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ MISS GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AND I'LL THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIXTY TWO AS THE CHAIR THE LET'S SAY THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS THIS IS ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITY BILLS THIS YEAR. I DON'T TALK ABOUT EVERY OFF THE MODEM ON THE SEX AT GARMENT WORKER FOR A REALLY LONG TIME GROWING UP I AND IN L. A. INSULT PIECEMEAL AS HOW SHE EARNS HER LIVING FOR A LONG TIME AND MEANT THAT OFTENTIMES SHE WOULD BRING HER WORK HOME THIS IS AFTER WORKING FROM SIX IN THE MORNING TO FIVE PM EVERY DAY. IT ALSO MEANT THAT PRESS KIDS. WOULD PITCH IN WHERE WE COULD TO HELP HER GET A WORK DONE- BUT IT MEANT THAT YOU COULDN'T ATTEND ANY OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES AND IF THERE IS A PLAN CONFERENCE. THE FIRST QUESTION WAS ARE YOU IN TROUBLE. IN CELLS LIKE KNOWS THAT GOOD BECAUSE I HAVE TIME FOR YOU TO BINGE I WILL NOT HAVE TIME TO GO TO GO TO SCHOOL. SO TO SPEAK GIVE YOUR BEFORE CARTER ME HOME TO ME THANK YOU. ALONG THE WAY AND SO IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE ODD OF WOMEN MOSTLY WOMEN WHO ARE WORKING. PERFECTLY BUT THEIR FAMILIES BY THIS A PIECEMEAL OUT THERE. IS A REALLY NEED TO REFORM. THE WAY WE DO. THIS WORK OUT THERE. I'M INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BUSINESSES. MOSTLY WELL LED BY WOMEN SMALL BUSINESSES ARE BEING. WHO ARE LEADING THE CHARGE FOR ETHICAL WORKPLACE. INSISTING ABILITY IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY THEY'RE ALREADY DOING A LOT OF WHAT THIS BILL IS. ASKING US TO DO. I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD OF THE GARMENT WORKERS HAVE BEEN LEADING THIS WAY FOR YEARS. LAST MONTH THEY BOARDED BUSES TO THE CAPITAL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AFTER LEVY LAUNCHES. IN THEIR FACTORIES TO ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHT TO SIMPLY GET MONEY THEY HAVE EARNED. UNFORTUNATELY WITH THAT THAT IS WIDESPREAD IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE GARMENT WORKERS IN THE STATE EXPERIENCE WHICH THAT THAT AT ALARMINGLY HIGH RATE. FORMER WORKERS MAY BE P. AND L. A. OFTEN FOR JUST FOUR DOLLARS OR FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR AND SEVERAL OF OUR ROOM WORKERS LOST THEIR LIVES AFTER. AT THEIR WORKPLACE OUTBREAKS OCCURRED IN NINETEEN THIS INCLUDED A LOT OF MY NEIGHBORS LITERALLY MY NEIGHBORS NEXT TO ME WE'RE SICK WE'RE COMING HOME WITH THE SICKNESS. ALONG THE WAY AS THEY WERE BEING DOZENS OF WORKERS THAT WE NEEDED TO KEEP US SAFE AND PROVIDE THE P. P. THAT WE NEEDED. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORK FOR LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. WHILE THE MINIMUM WAGE IS HAS WRECKED HAS RIGHTFULLY BEEN RISING CALIFORNIA. TO KEEP UP WITH THE COST OF LIVING. A SAMPLE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE FORTY SIX THOUSAND GARMENT WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET HOPE. AREN'T JUST A THIRD OF THAT MINIMUM WAGE TO PIECEMEAL AND LACK OF BROWN ACCOUNTABILITY. THESE WOMEN ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR PROSPEROUS FASHION INDUSTRY. THAT IS GOING AN ALLEY YET DESPITE THEIR ESSENTIAL SKILL WORK. THIS WOMAN ARE FACING SOMEWHERE SWITCHED UP CONDITIONS TO EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS. WOMEN FOR THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS. IT'S LONGER WE DO THAT WE PASSED SB SIXTY TWO. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA AND MY COLLEAGUE METHODICAL. FOR WORKING ON THIS ON BEHALF OF ALL THE WOMEN OUT THERE LIKE MY MOM. THAT THE SACRIFICE IN ABU SACRIFICE UP FOR A LONG TIME. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE WITH BEST FOR THEIR KIDS ALONG THE WAY RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GARCIA MISTER CHOI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND THE MEMBERS OF. YOUR TOOL COMMENT ON MANUFACTURERS SOUGHT AND I REGION WHO HAVE EXPRESSED A GREAT CONCERN WITH THE SP SIXTY TWO I. RISE SO TO SPEAK IN STRONG OPPOSITION. ARE YOU SYMPATHIZE SO WITH THE ARE COMMON WORKERS SO WHO ARE NOT PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME AND OVER OR NOT THE PROVIDED A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT. WHAT THE- WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IGNORING. THE A ROOT CAUSE SILVA PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY WHICH IS THE I NEED FOR INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND EDUCATION FOR WORKERS AND THE EMPLOYERS. ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA SUNDAY FOR LOSS. NOTHING IN THIS. SB SIXTY TWO ADDRESSES- THE BAD ACTORS IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY WHO CHOOSE TO BLATANTLY IGNORE CALIFORNIA SO ROBO START LABEL COURSE A SPECIFIC TO THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. SB SIX DID TO- WILL ELIMINATE THE CONTRACTING IN THE APPAREL INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA YES AND NO COMPANY IT WILL NOT TAKE ON THE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY OF WAR HAVING TO PAY FOR. WAGES AND THE OUR VIOLATIONS SO IT DID NOT COMMIT OR PAYING THE ATTORNEY'S FEES FOR ANOTHER COMPANY SO LITIGATION. THESE SAW EMPLOYERS ARE ARE ARE ALREADY ARE SUFFERING FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF THE PANDEMIC AND- THIS BILL COULD FORCE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS WHAT WORDS MAKE THEM LEAVE A CALIFORNIA LIKE MANY OTHERS I HAVE DONE SO FAR. TOOL MANUFACTURER ALL TOOL- THE STATE'S WAR ON THE COUNTRY'S OF BECAUSE IT IS NOT. THE ONE ON THE RISK. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE SO. OUR I READ THE FRONT PAGE IN NEW. ARE SO SEVERAL TIMES IN MY DISTRICT NOW WHAT DEEPLY CONCERNED CALIFORNIA HAS SOUGHT ELEVEN LABEL ALSO SPECIFIC TO COMMENT THE- WORKERS UP TO PROTECT THEIR WAGES UP AND ENSURE SAFE WORKING. ENVIRONMENTS WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS ALL WORK TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN THOSE THE EXISTING LAWS EXPOSE A BAD ACTORS AND A KID. BUSINESSES ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS SUCH A JOB KILLER AS WE'LL KNOW VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS ARE RISE OF PROFITABLE CO AUTHORED SB SIXTY TWO. CURRENT WORKERS HAVE FOUGHT TIRELESSLY TO COMBAT WAGE THEFT A WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS. THE GARMENT WORKERS DON'T WANT OUR SYMPATHY. THEY DEMAND AND DESERVE JUSTICE AND DIGNITY. BORRACHOS IN CALIFORNIA OFFER WORTH MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS PER DAY IN SIXTY TO SEVENTY HOURS PER WEEK WHILE RECEIVING ONLY THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER HOUR WELL BELOW THE STATE'S MINIMUM WAGE. ARM INDUSTRY EMPLOYERS ARE OFTEN FAILING TO PROVIDE WORKERS WITH BASIC MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PAY. WHICH TAKES A HEAVY FINANCIAL TOLL WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND UNDERMINE THE RESILIENCE OF THE COMMUNITIES. WHEN RESPONSIBLE RETAILERS MANUFACTURERS ENVIRONMENT CONTRACTORS ARE FORCED TO COMPETE WITH UNSCRUPULOUS GOVERNMENT EMPLOYERS WHO VIOLATE THE LAW THE RESULT IS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. THAT BRINGS DOWN STANDARDS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY RESPONSIBLE RETAILERS WAS SPONSORING A MANUFACTURER A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. IN ITS PUREST SENSE. THIS BILL IS SIMPLE WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON. ARE YOU ON SIDE OF THE WORK OF THE PREDOMINANTLY WOMAN WORKER WOMEN OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. OR ARE YOU ON THE SIDE OF THOSE WHO EXPLOIT THESE WORKERS. IT IS TIME TO END LEGALIZED WAGE THEFT IT IS TIME TO END LEGALIZED EXPLOITATION I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MISS DAVIES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU THEN SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY ARE RISING RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB SIXTY TWO. WE SAW THIS BILL COME THROUGH JUDICIARY AND I BROUGHT UP THESE CONCERNS THEN AND THE BILL STILL HAS NOT ADDRESS THEM. JOINT LIABILITY PRESENTLY EXIST IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY SB SIXTY TWO TRIES TO EXPAND THAT JOINT LIABILITY FAR BEYOND WHAT EXISTS IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY. COMPANIES WERE PRESUMED JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR ALL WAGES OWED TO WORKERS INCLUDING WORK DONE UNDER SOMEONE ELSE'S CONTRACT. THAT JOINT LIABILITY EXTENDS EVEN TO A COMPANY THAT OWNS THE LICENSE FOR DESIGNER CHARACTER ON THE GOVERNMENT NO OTHER INDUSTRY WITH JOINT LIABILITY HAS SUCH BROAD PROVISIONS. WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES RAISED BY THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL BUT THEY ARE NOT BEING ENFORCED. ENFORCEMENT OF THE GARMENT MANUFACTURING REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS MINIMUM WAGE LAWS AND OVERTIME LAWS ARE NEEDED TO LIMON EIGHT THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO STOP MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE OPERATING ILLEGALLY IT MERELY TRIES TO PASS A BILL TO SOMEONE ELSE. GOOD COMPANIES WILL MOVE WHAT LITTLE BEEN AFFECTING THEIR DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH THE REST. THEY WERE DESIGNED HERE AND SELL HERE BUT THEY WILL NOT MANUFACTURE HERE UNTIL THESE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED I'M ASKING TO OPPOSE SB SIXTY TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS DAVIS MISS AMERICA TWO G. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. B. SB SIXTY TWO AND I WANT TO SHARE. THIS IS LIKE A BLAST FROM THE PAST FOR ME WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL I WORKED WITH THE- A WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION CALLED THE- KARAN IMMIGRANT WORKERS ADVOCATES AND- BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THEY WERE ENGAGED AND A BOYCOTT CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE- A POPULAR. BRAND FOR WEDDING DRESSES THAT JUST COME UP MCCLINTOCK- BRAND AND- I REMEMBER THEN THAT- YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY- THE THEY THEY WERE SINGLED OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE CONTRACTING WITH THESE ESSENTIALLY THESE THESE FLY BY NIGHT SWEAT SHOPS THAT- THAT WOULD THAT WOULD TO. YOU KNOW- MAKE THEIR PARTS OF THE OF THESE BEAUTIFUL WHAT WOULD END UP BEING THE BEAUTIFUL WEDDING DRESSES- AND WHEN THE WHEN THE LABOR ENFORCEMENT WOULD TRY TO GOAL OUR GOAL AFTER THESE FLY BY NIGHT OPERATIONS THEY WOULD JUST SHUT DOWN AND THEY WOULD JUST. REFORM UNDER ANOTHER YOU KNOW CORPORATE ENTITY AND SO YOU KNOW IT IT SOUNDS LIKE. NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED. IN THESE DECADES THAT THE THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO. GO OVER A GO AFTER THESE BAD ACTORS IN TO ENFORCE EXISTING LAWS IS THAT THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THESE THESE CORPORATE SHELL GAMES. WHERE WERE YOU CREATE THESE THESE- AGAIN THE THESE FLY BY NIGHT SWEAT SHOPS THAT THAT THAT JUST WENT WHEN YOU TRY TO. ENFORCE THE LAW THAT THEY JUST SHUT DOWN AND REFORM UNDER ANOTHER CORPORATE ENTITY AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK. YOU KNOW THAT THIS- JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR THE MANUFACTURER FOR THE BRAND GUARANTOR IS SO IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR MOST VUNERABLE. WORKERS ARE GARMENT WORKERS AND THAT'S WHY IT RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIXTY TWO. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI THE THREE OF US YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY AS A CO AUTHOR AND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB SIXTY TWO- WHICH WOULD END WAGE THEFT IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND GARMENT WORKERS WITH THOUSANDS FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. WHERE I. LIVE AND- WHO WORK TWELVE HOUR. DAYS AND ARE PAID BY THE PIECE SOMETIMES AS LOW AS THREE CENTS APIECE. I PERSONALLY HAVE SEEN HOW EXPLOITED THESE WORKERS- HAVE BEEN OF MY BABY CENTER WHEN I WAS YOUNGER- LIKE A MIDDLE SCHOOL KID. FAMILY FRIEND WORKED IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY AND OFTEN TIMES WE HAD TO GO THERE. TO PICK UP THE KEYS ARE OUR LUNCH. AND I WOULD SEE. HOW THESE WORKERS ARE EXPLOITED THEY'RE GETTING PAID BY THE PIECE AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM. BELL GARDENS MENTIONED THIS WOMAN ALSO WOULD TAKE THE WORK HOME. AND WOULD HAVE HER CHILDREN HELPER BECAUSE SHE WAS GETTING PAID BY THE PIECE THIS WAS A SINGLE MOTHER. THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS IN THIS INDUSTRY ARE WOMEN. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING PAID AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE. IF A GARMENT BUSINESS CAN'T PAY ITS WORKERS A LIVING WAGE THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A GARMENT BUSINESS THAT'S NOT WHAT A BUSINESS IS- WE HAVE TO HOLD THIS INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE AND FIGHT. FOR THESE WOMEN IN THE INDUSTRY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB SIXTY TWO. THANK YOU MISS REAVIS MISTER FLOOR YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER- COLLEAGUES I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS. PARTICULAR BILL. THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO JUST ADDRESS- THIS IDEA THAT- HIS WORK IS THIS ROOT OF ALL EVIL. THERE'S A LOT OF INDUSTRIES WHERE IT WORKS REALLY REALLY WELL HE TAKE THE AUTO INDUSTRY- AN AUTO MANUFACTURER. ALLOWS X. AMOUNT OF HOURS TO DO A BRAKE JOB ON A VEHICLE. A LOT OF MECHANICS ARE REALLY REALLY FAST DOING GREAT JOBS ON THAT PARTICULAR VEHICLES WHAT THEY DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THEY CAN GET IT DONE QUICKER. THAN THE ALLOTTED TIME THAT THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN. THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT MAKING MORE MONEY BECAUSE A QUICKER AT THEIR JOB. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING. WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS TO ADDRESS THIS. WE'VE DONE NOTHING ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE OF THINGS. BECAUSE OF THE UNPRECEDENTED JOINT LIABILITY ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL IN THE PROVISIONS. COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT DO WHAT LITTLE MANUFACTURE WE DO IN THE STATE. ARE GOING TO MOVE OUTSIDE OF IT. BECAUSE OF THE BIRDS THAT WE CONTINUE TO PUT ON TOP OF THEM AS A LEGISLATOR AT THE BUILDING OF THE BODY. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WAGE THEFT. WAIT STAFF HAS WITH ALL OF THOSE JOBS MOVE OUT OF THE STATE. MAYES WAIT STAFF IS WITH ALL OF THOSE JOBS GO TO CAMBODIA GO TO KOREA GO TO VIETNAM. THAT'S WHERE THE MAJORITY OF OUR GARMENTS ARE MADE. IF WE WANT TO KEEP OUR CALIFORNIANS WORKING. WE NEED TO ENFORCE THE LAWS ON THE BOOK. AND WE NEED TO MAKE CALIFORNIA COMPANY I'M SORRY A STATE. THAT IS BUSINESS FRIENDLY. WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME IN UNDER A SET OF RULES AND WE NEED TO ENFORCE THOSE BUT THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL DO NONE OF THAT WE'RE GONNA DRIVE WHAT LITTLE WE HAVE LEFT ALL THE STATE AND I STRONGLY URGE. A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MR FOR A MYSTERY- YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AYE PRY AYE YOU PROBABLY RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIXTY TWO AS A- AS A CO OP OP AS A CO AUTHOR AND THE IMPORTANCE OF. THE GARMENT WORKER PROTECTION ACT THIS BILL. AND THE ABUSES AND SWEATSHOPS BUT IT IS NOT AS RELEVANT TO CALIFORNIA IT IS RELEVANT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ROSS THE FASHION INDUSTRY AND BEYOND AS JUST SO MENTIONED. BY OUR COLLEAGUE THAT THIS IS IN FACT A GLOBAL SYSTEMIC PROBLEM. A ROOT CAUSE OF INEQUALITY IS A LACK OF LABOR RIGHTS AND FINANCIAL RECORDS FOR PEOPLE FOR WORKING PEOPLE WHO ARE LABELED INDIRECT EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLY CHAINS ACROSS BIG COMPANIES CURRENTLY THERE ARE WORKERS MOSTLY WOMEN MOSTLY WOMEN OF COLOR. WHO ARE WORKING SIXTY TO SEVENTY HOURS A WEEK FOR AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY. YOU CAN'T FEED A FAMILY WITH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY. OR A WEEK I'M SORRY. YOU CAN'T PAY YOUR RENT WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK. THE AMERICAN DREAM DOESN'T BECOME A REALITY WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK. EARLIER IN THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I MET A WOMAN HER NAME IS LESSEN YOUR OTHER FEE NOT FROM MY COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES. SHE IS THE CHAIRMAN IDEA FROM GUATEMALA. SHE'S INDIGENOUS. AND SHE EARNS AN AVERAGE OF THREE TO FIVE DOLLARS A DAY. HER ACTIONS OF WANTING TO BE A PART OF A PROCESS THAT DEFENDS HER RIGHTS HER DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO FEED HER FAMILY. HER LOVE OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHERESHE IS RAISING HER FAMILY AND WHERE SHE HOPES TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN LIVE. CAN'T COMPETE. WITH ONLY EARNING THREE TWO FIVE DOLLARS THROUGH PIECEMEAL- IN HER INDUSTRY AND IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY IN GENERAL. AND WHAT I TOLD HER WHEN I MET HER WAS HER WORK HAS VALUE HER WORK HAS DIGNITY AND SHE IS DESERVING. OF A LIVING WAGE. SB SIXTY TO CREATE THE STRUCTURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WAGE THEFT IN A DOES AWAY WITH THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM FUELED BY THE INHUMANE EXPLOITATION. OF VULNERABLE WORKERS THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE. ACROSS VARIOUS INDUSTRIES IN OUR STATE. IT IS TIME TO EXTEND PROTECTIONS TO GARMENT WORKERS AND TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RIGHTS PROTECTIONS WAGES AND BENEFITS MATCH THOSE NEEDS MANY GARMENT WORKERS WHO WERE MAKING THE MASS THAT MANY OF US ARE CURRENTLY WEARING AND HAVE BEEN WEARING. FOR THE PAST NINETEEN MONTHS AMID A GLOBAL PANDEMIC SUFFERED THE MOST. WERE THE MOST IMPACTED BY COVERT. AND DIED BECAUSE OF COLD IT AND ALL THEY ARE ASKING IS TO BE SEEN TO BE RECOGNIZED AND TO BE VALUED FOR THEIR WORK. THAT IS WHY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON SB SIXTY TWO. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO MISTER JOHN SO ARE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AS A CO AUTHOR OF SB SIXTY TWO. THIS IS A TIMELY BUILDER LOOKS TO ELIMINATE THE EXPLOITIVE PRACTICE OF THE PIECE RATE SYSTEM IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. AND ENSURE WORKERS ARE GIVEN BASIC LABOR PROTECTIONS. IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR WORKERS MOST OF WHOM ARE IMMIGRANT WOMEN TO SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS MAKING CLOTHING OR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ONLY TO PAY EIGHT CENTS FOR EVERY PIECE EQUALLY AS LITTLE AS FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THIS INDUSTRY CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THRIVING ON WORKER EXPLOITATION WITH A ROB CLOSE TO SIX HUNDRED ANDNINE DOLLARS IN WAGES. DURING AN AVERAGE WEEK WORK. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW MY MOTHER WORKED IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. I USED TO VISIT HER. WHERE SHE WORKED DOWN THE STREET FROM THE UNIVERSITY I WENT TO. AND I SAW HER AND OTHER WOMEN THERE WORKING EVERY DAY. I ACTUALLY GOT FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A GARMENT WORKER MAKING THESE CLOTHES FOR THESE WEALTHY. DEPARTMENT STORES WHO WOULD SELL THEM FOR HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AND THEN THEY WOULD COME BACK TO THE ORIGINAL JOB WORKERS WOULD GO TO ONES THAT DID IT AND IT WOULD SELL IT FOR TEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. SO I ALSO KNOW. WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ON MADISON LEE LINE AND I WILL TELL YOU IS NOT LIKE BEING AT A FORD PLANT NOT BEEN TO A FORD PLANT IT TO COMPARE THE TWO IS NOT RIGHT IN ON JUST THIS THE COMPANY EVENTUALLY WENT TO TEXAS. AND SO THEY COULD GET BETTER DEAL PAID LOWER WAGES AND HE JUST LEFT BILLS WORKERS. MY MOTHER IS NOW IN THEIR OLDER YEARS NO RETIREMENT THE COMPANY'S LONG BEEN GONE. AND SHE WAS EXPLOITED FOR ALL. AND SO I NOT ONLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM IN REAL TIME RIGHT NOW BUT I ALSO KNOW THE DEVASTATING EFFECT OF GARMENT WORKERS NOT HAVING THE ABILITY. TO HAVE. THE TYPE OF WAGES THAT THEY NEED SO THEY CAN HAVE NOTONLY A LIFESTYLE THAT CAN FEED YOUR FAMILY AND MOVE ON BUT TO BE ABLE TO GO ON BEYOND THAT MOSTLY WHEN THEY RETIRE. AND SO THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. OF US ACTUALLY TAKING CARE OF THOSE WHERE A LOT OF US DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THEM BECAUSE WE JUST ENJOYED THE GARMENTS THAT WE HAVE ON RIGHT NOW. WHERE WE SIT. AND YOU JUST NEED TO REALIZE. THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO. MAKE VERY VERY LITTLE. SO YOU CAN LOOK VERY VERY GOOD. WHEN YOU COME IT IS CAPITAL. AND WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THE PRICE PAID TO PROPER WAGES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER SEEING HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU- I JUST I WANT TO BRING. ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT A NUMBER OF- THOSE WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL BROUGHT UP IN THIS THE NOTION THAT THERE'S NO EFFORTS TO CRACK DOWN ON THIS TYPE OF WAGE THEFT. THERE HAS BEEN THERE HAVE BEEN FOR DECADES LIKE MY COLLEAGUES FROM ON THE LOS ANGELES AREA WAS SAYING IT FROM TORRANCE WHAT THISGONNA IT DIDN'T TEST MY KNOWLEDGE HERE- WAS SAYING YOU KNOW THE JESSICA MCCLINTOCK BOYCOTT WE'VE SEEN AT. IN FACT OUR PREVIOUS- LABOR SECRETARY NOW NUMBER TWO IF THEY IF THEY US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AT SHE MADE HER CAREER OUT OF TRYING TO GO AFTER THESE COMPANIES. BUT LIKE IN ALL WAGE THEFT WHAT HAPPENS AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS ACHIEVABLE WHEN YOU HAVE BUSINESSES THAT WILL POP UP. ABUSE WORKERS AND THEN LITERALLY DISAPPEAR. THERE IS NO RECOURSE THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE THE WORKER HOLE WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S LIKE PLAYING WHACK A MOLE. AND SO WHAT WE DID IN THE STATE I WE HAVE A FRONT WE HAVE A FUND THAT ALL OF US IN FACT IN THIS LAST BUDGET PUT MONEY INTO TO TRY TO RECLAIM SOME OF THE WAGES FOR THOSE WORKERS HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM OUR- SO WE AS TAXPAYERS ARE SUBSIDIZING THIS ABUSE OF SUBCONTRACTORS. BUT THE FOLKS WHO ARE ACTUALLY PURCHASED SEEN THAT CLOTHING FROM THE CONTRACTOR. LIKE FOREVER TWENTY ONE FASHION NOVA THEY KNOW THE DEMANDS ARE MAKING ON THAT SUBCONTRACTOR DON'T PAY ENOUGH FOR THAT WORKER TO BE MAKING MINIMUM WAGE THEY SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE THEY ARE THE ONES PROFITING OFF THAT CHEAP LABOR IN THE END. THERE IS A RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE. BRAND GUARANTORS TO ENSURE THAT THIS ISN'T HAPPENING. AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE ABUSE OF GARMENT WORKERS FOR EVER. FOR FAR TOO LONG IT'S TIME THAT CALIFORNIA STAND UP AND NOT SAY OH MY GOD SOMEBODY MIGHT LEAVE THE STATE. NO MAYBE WILL TAKE AN INDUSTRY THAT IS ABUSIVE NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT NEW YORK AND INTERNATIONALLY AND START TO MAKE A DENT IN THAT ABUSE THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY THESE ARE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE DOING THIS WORK. AND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIPON WHO. SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW PIECE WORK IS A GOOD THING AND IT CAN BE WHERE YOU GET INCENTIVES FOR DOING WORK QUICKER YOU CAN MAKE MORE MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE UNDER THIS BILL. THE TRUTH IS THE PEACE WORK THAT THEY'RE BEING PAID FOR YOU NEVER EVEN HIT MINIMUM WAGE THESE ARE AUTO WORKERS THESE ARE WOMEN IN SWEATSHOP LIKE CONDITIONS S R TWO CENTS TO CENTS PER ITEM CAN YOU IMAGINE I REMEMBER HEARING FROM ONE WOMAN WHO TOLD ME AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT SHE DID A GOOD JOB. BECAUSE BEFORE SHE HAD THE JOB IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY SHE WAS HUMAN TRAFFICKED AND GOT ZERO DOLLARS SO SHE THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY BECAUSE SHE WAS MAKING MONEY AND THEN REALIZED THAT SHE COULD NEVER MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET BY. AND SHE TOLD ME THE STORY ABOUT HOW SHE HAD THIS CHILD HER DAUGHTER AND SHE HAD TO KEEP THAT CHILD IN A BOX NEXT TO HER HER HER- SELLING MACHINE BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T STOP SHE COULDN'T AFFORD CHILD CARE FOR HER CHILD SHE LITERALLY HAD A CHILD IN A BOX IN THE SEWING MACHINE AND SHE'S MAKING YOUR TWO CENTS MASK. THAT SOMEBODY SOLD TO YOU FOR TEN DOLLARS. WELL THAT. WHO SOLD IT TO YOU FOR TEN DOLLARS NEEDS TO MAKE HER WHOLE. BECAUSE THEIR WHOLE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT EVERYBODY IN THE STATE WHO DOES WORK. GET A MINIMUM WAGE MY GOD IT'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE FIGHTING FOR WORKERS TO EARN A MINIMUM WAGE. AND HOLDING PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THE PROFITS OFF OF THEIR LOW PAY IF WE CAN'T DO THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO. I IMPLORE YOU THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO ENSURE GARMENT WORKERS HAVE BASIC HUMAN DIGNITY. ANOTHER SO THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED IN THE WORKPLACE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROAD. ALL MEMBERS THOSE WHO THIRTY VOTE. ALL MEMBERS THOSE WHO DESERVE IT. ALL MEMBERS THIRTY DESERVE A- CLERK.

CLARK WELL CLOSER ALL TELL YOU THAT I SIXTY SIX NO ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO BE JUMPING AHEAD IN THE FILE TO TAKE UP FILE ITEM ONE FORTY FOUR THIS IS FILE ITEM. ONE FORTY FOUR. SENATE BILL. THREE FORTY THREE. CARBERY SENATE BILL THREE FORTY THREE BY SENATOR ALLEN AND OTHERS MACALINTAL ENVIRONMENTAL ADVERTISING. THIS GONZALEZ EMAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL THAT I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE IT WOULDN'T BE FOR I HONESTLY CAN'T IMAGINE HOW ANYONE COULD ARGUE AGAINST THIS BILL IT IS SIMPLE IT SAYS YOU CANNOT HAVE THE CHASE SCENE ARROW SYMBOL THAT SYMBOL THAT WE ALL ASSOCIATE WITH BEING RECYCLABLE ON MATERIAL THAT'S NOT RECYCLABLE. LAKE HOW DO YOU ARGUE AGAINST THAT. WE ARE ALLOWING AND ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE CONSUMERS TO PUT MATERIAL INTO THE RECYCLING BIN THEY CAN NEVER BE RECYCLED THAT WE KNOW HAS TO THEN BE REMOVED TO RECYCLABLES AND SENT INTO THE LANDFILL WHY BECAUSE IT MAKES A COMPANY'S BRAND TO LOOK GREEN FRIENDLY. WHICH CYCLE LEAN WE'RE GONNA PRETEND THAT SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE WILL HAVE SOME TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO RECYCLE IT BUT FOR NOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY FOR YOU. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. IT'S DISHONEST IT'S NOT THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS OR COMPANIES TO ALLOW IT. AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT IN THE INTEREST. OF OUR GOALS TO REACH RECYCLING RATES FOR SINGLE USE PLASTICS. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE HONEST WITH OURSELVES. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO START TO DO. I HAVE YET TO HEAR AN ARGUMENT IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL THAT MAKES ANY SENSE IF SOMEBODY HAS IT PLEASE TELL ME. I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT BATTERIES WELL GUESS WHAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE THROWING BATTERIES IN THE RECYCLING BIN THAT'S WHAT STARTS FIRES. THEY'RE NOT RECYCLABLE. THAT IS A BAD CONDUCT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE THROWING IN PLASTICS THAT MAYBE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL HAVE TECHNOLOGY TO RECYCLE. THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL MISTER ALLEN SENATOR ALLEN HAS WORKED WITH THE OPPOSITION STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE SPECTRUM IN AN EFFORT TO REACH A MIDDLE GROUND AND IT'S TAKEN NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS INCLUDING GIVING YOU MANUFACTURES MORE TIME TO COMPLY. AND REDUCING CALORIE CYCLES DISCRETION AND WORKLOAD. CURRENT LAW ALREADY PROHIBITS THE MANUFACTURE FOR MAKING UNTRUTHFUL ENVIRONMENT CLAIMS SUCH AS EARTH FRIENDLY OR RECYCLABLE. AND SB THREE FORTY THREE SIMPLY EXTENDS THE PROHIBITION TO THE USE OF THE CHASING ARROW SYMBOL IF A PRODUCT OR PACKAGING IS NOT TRULY RECYCLABLE. BY CLARIFYING THE ONLY ACTUAL RECYCLABLE MATERIAL CAN DISPLAY THE CHASING ERA SYMBOL SB THREE FORTY THREE WILL END CONSUMER CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IS RECYCLABLE. IMPROVE RECYCLING EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCE CONTAMINATION COSTS AT RECYCLING FACILITIES. WE WORK HARD TO TRY TO TAKE ON THE PLASTIC ISSUE THE SINGLE USE PLASTIC ISSUE. ON THE FLOOR AND WE COME SHORT. BUT COLLEAGUES IF WE CANNOT EVEN SAY THAT CONSUMERS DESERVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHETHER PRODUCTS SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE BLUE BIN OR NOT IF THAT'S TOO DIFFICULT I REALLY WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR EARTH QUITE FRANKLY SO IF ANYONE'S OPPOSED TO THIS BILL I CHALLENGE YOU TO STAND UP AND EXPLAIN WHAT IS SO ONEROUS ABOUT. ASKING A PRODUCT TO TELL US THE TRUTH. BUT IF NOT. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE BY. THANK RESIDENTS ALSO. THERE'S NO NEED TO STAND UP. THIS RIVAS DIRECTOR THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY AS A CO AUTHOR AND SUPPORTER OF SB THREE FORTY THREE WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE EXISTING TRUTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL ADVERTISING LAW TO END CONSUMER CONFUSION ABOUT WITH WHAT MATERIALS ARE% RECYCLABLE I AGREE WITH THE MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO I THINK THIS IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW. OF WHAT IS RECYCLABLE BY THE LABEL THAT IS ON THE CONTAINER YEAH AS CHAIR OF NATURAL RESOURCES I BELIEVE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THE RECYCLING PROCESS STRAIGHTFORWARD WE KNOW THAT LESS THAN 15% OF SINGLE USE PLASTICS ARE RECYCLED AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN UNCLEAR TO CONSUMERS WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT RECYCLABLE WITH THIS BILL WE WOULD PROHIBIT COMPANIES FROM USING THE WORD RECYCLABLE ON UN RECYCLABLE PRODUCTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS REAVIS. MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THINK SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING OF STANDING UP TO SPEAK AGAINST THIS- BUT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS ONE- OF- TALK TO MY LOCAL WASTE MANAGEMENT GUYS- THEY REACHED OUT THEY RICHARD ME THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THIS. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ON AND SOME OF THE FOOD PRODUCTS AND SOME OF THAT THINGS BUT THE AUTHOR HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO WORK WITH PEOPLE- WHICH IS A NICE SURPRISE- SO ON THIS ONE. I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IN THE BIG ACADEMIC. CORPORATE TERM IS CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S ONLY ENOUGH IT'S DOING THE RIGHT THING AND USING THE LABELS CORRECTLY. AND WHEN YOU TALK TO GUYS LIKE WASTE MANAGEMENT BACK HOME THAT DO THIS AS A PROFESSION. AND THEY SAY THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THIS. THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN. TALKED TO THIS ISN'T SOMETHING NEW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED FOR YEARS. AND IT'S TIME TO TAKE THAT STEP FORWARD AND MAKE IT RIGHT SO ASTRONOMICAL. FIGMENTS MATHIS MS GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I ALSO ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE FOR THIS BILL THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL BUT IT'S REALLY A MODEST BILL. IT'S JUST LETTING CONSUMERS KNOW THAT WHEN THEY SEE THAT ARROW THINGS ARE REALLY BEING RECYCLED WE'VE DONE A LOT OF EDUCATION. OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF ASSUME THAT WE SEE THERE WHERE YOU PUT IT INTO THE TRASH AND IS BEING RECYCLED BUT- IT'S IN THE SINGLE DIGITS A LOT OF TIMES WITH BEING RECYCLED. FOLKS HAVE TALKED ABOUT ON RAMPS THE ON RAMP IS YOU HAVE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. TO GET TO WRITE A MODEST GOAL OF ONLY 60% WE SHOULD REALLY GOING GETTING TO NINETY FIVE YES ME. AND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SHOW THAT YOU HAVE A MAP THAT WILL BE ON YOUR WAY THAT YOU CAN GET AN EXTENSION. ON SO THERE'S ARMS THERE'S BEEN CONFUSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT OTHER EPR PROGRAMS ARE EXEMPT AND THEY ARE YOU CAN LOOK AT PAGE SEVEN. OUR EARLY UNEASY THAT CARPET THAT- RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES THAT MATT MATTER SAYS ANYTHING WHEN AN EXISTING THE PR PROGRAM IS EXEMPT ALSO. IN THIS BILL AS WELL THE AUTHORS IN THE ADVOCATES HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. THERE'S A LOT WE NEED TO DO IN THIS SPACE BUT THE FIRST STEP IN SHARING THAT CONSUMERS HAVE SIMPLE INFORMATION. TO MAKE SMART CHOICES ALONG THE WAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS. GARCIA THANK YOU MEMBERS. C. NO OTHER MEMBERS RECOGNITION AS- YOU MAKE. I HAVEN'T I WANNA POINT OUT THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN BY THE AUTHOR- ENSURED THAT THE CHAMBER THE RETAILERS IN THE ABA AND TONS OF OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS ARE NOW NEUTRAL- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN EYE ON THIS VERY COMMONSENSE TRANSPARENCY BILL. BARBARO. DESIRABLE ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS THAT A VOTE. CLARK WELL. CLOSE ROLL TIDE ABOUT. HIGHS FORTY THREE NO ZERO. THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO MOVE BACK IN THE FILE TO TAKE A FILE ITEM ONE THIRTY ONE. THIS IS FILE ITEM ONE THIRTY ONE. SENATE BILL SIX THREE NINE. CORKERY SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY NINE BY SENATOR ALSO AND OTHERS NOT GOING INTO EMPLOYMENT. THIS GONZALES THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SB SIX THIRTY NINE ENSURES THAT WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES CANNOT BE PAID LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. THE CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF IN LEADING THE COUNTRY WITH A FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE AND CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES ARE STILL BEING EXPLOITED OFTEN FOR LADY WAGES LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS PER HOUR. SB SIX THIRTY NINE WOULD STOP PERMITTING NEW EMPLOYERS FROM PAYING LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE BEGINNING NEXT YEAR IT REQUIRE RELEVANT AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A PLAN BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO PHASE OUT THE EXISTING MINIMUM WAGE EXEMPTIONS. ALL REMAINING EXEMPTIONS TO MEMO AGE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE PHASED OUT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE PAYMENT OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE AND IT'S AN ARCHAIC RELIC OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND DATES TO A TIME WHEN CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WERE DENIED AN EDUCATION. AND BEFORE LEGISLATION CLEAN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT RECOGNIZE THE FULL HUMANITY APART PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE STATE OF ALASKA CONNECTICUT MARYLAND NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW YORK OREGON MINNESOTA RHODE ISLAND TEXAS. AND WASHINGTON HAVE ALL STOPPED THE PRACTICE OF GRANTING EXEMPTIONS TO THE MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT IT'S TIME FOR GAP CALIFORNIA TO JOIN THE RANKS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF WORK IN THE VALUE WE PLACE ON LABOR OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IS INVESTED HEAVILY IN PROGRAMS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF INDIVIDUALS MOVING OUT OF SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT. THIS INCLUDED SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET FOR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATORS AND DOUBLING THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PRINT SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR PLACING FOLKS IN COMPETITIVE. INTEGRATIVE EMPLOYMENT. NOW IT'S THE TIME TO END THIS UNJUST PRACTICE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. MISTER LUCKY YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I STAND UP TODAY IN OPPOSITION SB SIX THIRTY NINE. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR HOWEVER THAT THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS BILL. BUT IT CONTAINS A FATAL FLAW ONE THAT REQUIRES AN EXPLANATION. FIRST THE NOTION THAT WE OUGHT TO PASS THE DEPARTMENT. OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN. UNDER WHICH PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COULD MAKE MINIMUM WAGE OR HIGHER WHEN THEY'RE WORKING IS A TERRIFIC IDEA. AS IT STANDS TODAY PEOPLE WITH IBD WORK IN JOBS WHERE THEY WORK VERY INDEPENDENTLY MAKE WAGES THAT ARE HIGHER THAN MINIMUM WAGE. THERE ARE SOME HOWEVER THE SOLELY BECAUSE OF THEIR INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. CANNOT COMPETE IN MANY JOBS BECAUSE OF PRODUCTIVITY DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARDS OF THE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE. THOSE PEOPLE LITERALLY MEET THE STANDARDS OF THE FEDERAL FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT THAT ALLOWS THEM BY CHOICE. TO TAKE A JOB THAT PAYS LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. THE OTHER PART OF THELAW REQUIRES THAT THEY EXPRESSED THIS CHOICE TO THE INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM PLAN OR KNOWN AS THE I. P. P. THAT IS DEVELOPED WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. THE FEDERAL LAW FURTHER REQUIRES THAT THEIR PRODUCTIVITY IN THE JOB. BE REMEASURED EVERY SIX MONTHS. AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES SO MUST OUR PAY. ADDITIONALLY IF THE PAY FOR THAT POSITION GOES UP THEIR PAY MUST ALSO BE INCREASED AS WELL. THE FATAL FLAW THIS BILL IS THAT IT ALSO SAYS THE PEOPLE WITH IBD MAKING LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE CAN NO LONGER DO THAT PASSED JANUARY. ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OR POSSIBLY LATER THE DEPARTMENT TAKES LONGER TO DEVELOP A PLAN. MEMBERS WE SHOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY THAT ALL PEOPLE WITH ALREADY WORKING TO MAKE MINIMUM WAGE OR HIGHER. IN FACT THERE ARE WAYS TO MAKE THIS WORK. WE COULD SUBSIDIZE THE SUBSIDIZE THE GAP BETWEEN PRODUCTIVITY WAGE UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND MINIMUM WAGE. WE CAN ALSO DO AS OUR COLLEAGUE BRIAN MAIENSCHEIN PROPOSED TWICE. TWO TIMES. HE PROPOSED A BILL OFFERING EMPLOYERS WITH THE TAX CREDIT TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE TO THEIR WORKERS WITH IDT EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD BE PAID LESS UNDER FEDERAL LAW. BOTH TIMES THIS BILL WAS HELD APPROPRIATIONS. AFTER PASSING UNANIMOUSLY IN THE REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE. THE THIRD BILL BY IT ALSO A FORMER COLLEAGUE DANTE ACOSTA PROPOSED THE SAME AND HAVE THE SAME HOLDING. OF THE MICE. THE FACT IS THAT THIS BILL IS PASSED AS IS THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. WITH IDT WILL LOSE THEIR CURRENT JOBS THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO BE WORKING IN. AND ARE APPROVED IN THE I. P. P. SITTING IS THAT A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. A BILL DECLARING EMPLOYMENT TO THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR PEOPLE WITH IBD. THE EMPLOYMENT RATE OF PEOPLE WITH IDT. WHEN THIS BILL WAS PASSED WAS 40% 14% GUESS WHAT IT IS TODAY EVEN AFTER WE MADE A POINT WITH THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF THE STATE. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF BILL OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES 14% WE'VE ALSO NOT FUNDED ADEQUATELY THE PROGRAMS SERVING THIS POPULATION. SO SUDDENLY EXPECTING THAT THIS RATE WERE MIRACULOUSLY GET BETTER IT'S CRAZY. I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL UNLESS THE TIMELINE IS TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL. YES THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES GIVES US OUR BEST IDEAS. BUT WHEN YOU DO. TELL US HOW YOUR GOING TO FUND IT IF WE LIKE IT WE CAN PASS IT AND PUT THE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET BUT IN THE MEANTIME PLEASE DON'T TAKE AWAY THE JOBS AT TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE. A PEOPLE THAT HAVE ADD- TODAY WITHOUT HAVING A PLAN IN PLACE. SO I ORIGINAL VOTE. MR MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS ONE. IN A LOT OF THE CONCERNS OF ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED WHAT I'M GONNA READDRESS THEM. INFIRMITY YOU YOU KNOW I'LL- I AM A FATHER OF A CHILD WITH DISABILITIES. I LIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY I WORK WITH THIS COMMUNITY MY PHONE HAS BEEN RINGING OFF THE HOOK. OUT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL FROM OUR IT D. COMMUNITY. WHILE IT'S A GREAT IDEA IN IN WE THINK THAT YES LET'S GIVE THEM A MINIMUM WAGE LET'S DO THIS LET'S MAKE SURE THEIR WORK MATTERS. BUT WHAT WE'RE MISSING. IS THE IMPORTANCE THAT THEY FEEL ABOUT THE LITTLE BIT OF WORK THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO DO. THEY ENJOY GOING INTO AND WHAT THEY DO BECAUSE- THEY SEEK FULFILLMENT FROM IT. THEY IT THEY ARE IT'S LITTLE BIT THEY ARE ABLE TO DO. I BEEN ON TOURS ALL OF AND DOWN THE STATE. BACK WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF HUMANS. GOING IN A MEETING WITH OUR IDT COMMUNITY GOING INTO THE JOB SITE THAT WE FIGHT LIKE HELL TO BE ABLE TO GET THE CONTRACTS JUST TO BE ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR. SO THOSE WITH DISABILITIES. CAN DO THESE JOBS. WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS PUSHING THOSE CONTRACTS AWAY AND I AND I GET IT I THINK WE ALL AGREE. THAT YES THEY SHOULD GET PAID MORE. WHERE'S THE SUBSIDY TO PAY THEM MORE WE'RE GIVING ALL THIS MONEY AWAY FOR ALL THESE OTHER THINGS WHERE'S THE MONEY. FOR MORE BUDGET TO SUBSIDIZE THEIR WORK TO HELP THEM OUT TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY SHOULD BE COMING FROM. WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE THE MEANING IN LIFE IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION TAKES THAT AWAY FROM THEM. BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE IT THE COMPANY'S THAT GO OUT AND FIGHT FOR THESE CONTRACTS TO TRY TO GET. OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WITH DISABILITIES UP OFF THE COUCH OF OUT OF THE HOUSE OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY TO BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY YOU'RE TAKING THAT AWAY MEMBERS PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT I ASK YOU FOR YOUR NO VOTE WE CAN DO BETTER ON THIS AN INSURER. THEN THE RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE. MISTER VEHICLE GLASS. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALTHOUGH THIS BILL WAS WELL INTENDED. I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL- THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS IT IS TRYING TO HELP. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYERS WHO AREN'T ARE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL WANT TO PAY A FAIR WAGE OF UP TO ALL THE WORKERS REGARDLESS OF THIS OF THE DISABILITY. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NO REINSURANCE IN THIS BILL THAT WORKERS AFFECTED WILL REMAIN EMPLOYED IN THE LONG RUN. I GOT TO SAY THAT AYE AYES AYE SUPPORTED THIS AND COMMITTEE. AND I BROWN STRONGLY WHEN I SUPPORTED. BUT AFTER HEARING IN GETTING MORE AND MORE INFORMATION GETTING THE CALLS HEARING HEARING FROM PARENTS. THAT THEY'RE SCARED THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO HELP BUT THIS IS REALLY GOING TO HURT THEM. AND THEY WISH THAT MAYBE THE STATE WOULD WOULD JUMPED IN TO HELP AT THE END TO GRANDFATHER THURMOND. AND BECAUSE OF THAT BUT LISTENING TO MANY PARENTS. FOLKS THAT GOT ON THE PHONE BOOKS THAT SHOWED UP. I LITERALLY WENT BACK TO MY OFFICE AND SAT WITH STAFF AND GO HEY YOU KNOW WHERE DID WE NOT SEE THIS COMING. SO I CALLED I QUESTION THAT RIGHT NOW I REALLY DO. YOU KNOW I DUG DEEP IN MY DISTRICT AND MAKE CALLS AND VISIT. AND TALK TO PARENTS. I GO I GO TO A BAGEL SHOP IN MY AND MY COMMUNITY. AND I SEE THAT THOSE WORKERS THERE ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO THE BEST THING BUT- IT IS SO HARD I JUST FEAR I FEAR FOR THAT FOR THAT WORKER THAT THEY MAY LOSE THEIR JOB SO FOR THOSE REASONS. I WILL NOT BE STE I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR SPEAKER. MR FRAZIER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR. FOR HER COMPASSION. IN FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I'M BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL- EARLY ON I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND SAN DIEGO ARE PROVISIONS CHAIR. AND SHE- ACKNOWLEDGED MY CONCERNS AND MADE THE BILL MUCH BETTER. AND I THANK HER FOR THAT. I'M THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. AND IT'S BEEN SPOKEN OF. IS THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES IN THE DISABLED COMMUNITY. YOU HAVE PHYSICAL DISABILITIES YOU HAVE COGNITIVE DISABILITIES THERE'S A DIFFERENTIAL OF CAPABILITIES OF HOW PEOPLE CAN FUNCTION. IN A WORKPLACE. NO A LOT OF FOLKS AND I'VE BEEN IN IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN INTO A WORK CENTER WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. YOU SEE THAT THEY'RE FAST THEY'RE IT'S FASCINATING. THE WAY THEY ARE HAPPY WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS PLEASURABLE FOR THEM THEY FEEL ENGAGED. BUT THEY COULDN'T COMPETE WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S IN A TYPICAL. PERSON WHO HAS ALL THE ABILITIES THEY CAN'T DO THAT. AND SO IF YOU PUT THEM UP TO AN EMPLOYER WHO SAYS YOU'RE GONNA PAY THIS PERSON. MINIMUM WAGE. WHO ARE THEY GONNA PICK. WHO ARE THEY GONNA PICK. SO HAS BEEN MENTIONED TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE IN JEOPARDY. OF BEING DISPLACED WITH THIS BILL AT A COST OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADULT DAY CENTERS FOR CALIFORNIA NO WE DID PASS A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR. BUDGET PLAY FOR THE IDT POPULATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED OVER FIVE YEARS. AND THAT MONEY WAS NEEDED FIVE YEARS AGO. SO WHEN WE GO TO OUR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. THAT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IS GOING TO BE LESS IMPACTFUL. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOW. NO ONE I'D SAY THAT THIS IS HARMFUL TO PEOPLE I'M I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE MOST MONEY POSSIBLE N. AS MR LACKEY FROM. HIS DISTRICT FROM WHERE. PALMDALE. MENTIONED THAT IT IS ASSESSED EVERY SIX MONTHS FOUR CAPABILITY GROWTH THAT IS NO KID THAT'S OKAY. EVERYBODY WANTS THEM TO MAKE MORE MONEY BECAUSE THE PROVIDER WOULD MAKE MORE MONEY IF THEY MAKE MORE MONEY. SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT AGAIN THIS MIGHT HAVE THE MOMENTUM. IT MIGHT GO FORWARD AND IF IT DOES I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO THE IDT POPULATION WERE I HAVE. BEEN INVOLVED WITH THEM FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. SIXTEEN YEARS THAT I'VE DEVELOPED MY DEVOTED MY LIFE IS POPULATION AND ALL OF YOU HAVE BEEN AMAZING THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION WITH YOUR SUPPORT FOR THEIR- FISCAL GROWTH WITH THE PROVIDERS. BUT IF WE VOTE YES ON THIS BILL. WE'RE GONNA BE HURTING MORE PEOPLE THAN WE HELP. I REGIONAL. MR GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I I TO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE PASSION THE AUTHOR HAS FOR THE IDT COMMUNITY. AND I ALSO WANT TO STATE THAT- INTENTIONS OF BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ARE TO BE LAUDED. HOWEVER YOU KNOW THAT- GOOD INTENTIONS DON'T ALWAYS DELIVER DESIRED RESULTS. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE EACH AND EVERYONE OF US KNOW ALL TOO WELL WHAT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES CAN BRING OUR WAY. AND WHEN- WHEN I INQUIRED UNANSWERED WAS GIVEN THAT WELL WE WILL MAINSTREAM. THESE PEOPLE ARE THESE FOLKS INTO THE WORK FORCE. AND I REMEMBER WHEN A SCHOOL DISTRICT TRIED TO MAINSTREAM MY SISTER. AND THE HELL SHE WENT THROUGH. AND THE TORMENT EVERYDAY UNTIL FINALLY MY PARENTS WERE ABLE TO CONVINCE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE SHE COULDN'T BE MAINSTREAM. AND I AM CONCERNED THAT- SHERRY IN WHOM MANY OF YOU ON THIS FLOOR HAVE MET. THAT- SHE WOULD FALL VICTIM TO AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. OF THIS BILL. FOR HER AND I KNOW THE CONS OF THE CONVERSATION OF THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN A LOT ABOUT. MONEY AND PAYMENT AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE THAT CAN BE MAINSTREAMED AND HAVE BEEN AND THERE ARE THOSE THAT CAN AND WILL BE. AND WE DEFINITELY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE IS DISCRIMINATED OR PAID LESS AND EXPLOITED BECAUSE OF THEIR LIFE SITUATION. HOWEVER IN SOME CASES IT'S NOT THE CASE AND FOR SURE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY IT'S ABOUT THE SOCIAL NETWORK IT'S ABOUT THE SELF CONFIDENCE THAT COMES. IT'S ABOUT BUILDING THE INWARD PERSON. WHERE SHE IS SO PROUD TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP AND SAY I HAVE A JOB. AND WHEN I CALL AND I TALKED TO HER AND I ASK YOU DID YOU GO TO WORK TODAY YES WOULD YOU DO THAT'S NOT EVEN THE ISSUE. THE ISSUE IS WHO SHE WAS WITH. AND TO BE ABLE TO LIVE THAT LIFE AND TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THAT HONORED THAT PRIVILEGE. TO BE ABLE TO SAY I WENT TO WORK I CONTRIBUTED I DID SOMETHING LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT IN A WORKING ENVIRONMENT. AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT'S NOT ABOUT TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SHE CAN GO AND WORK ALONGSIDE SOMEONE ELSE THAT KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE SHE'S AT. AND THAT SHE CAN RELATE WITH AND SO WITH THAT- I WOULD SIMPLY ASK THAT WE LOOK AT THIS AND THINK ABOUT IT. AND- APPROACH IT WITH THE WITH THE FLOSS WITH THE IDEA OF DO NO HARM. AND THAT'S ALL I ASK I ASK THAT. THAT WE LOOK AT THIS IN A IN A PERSPECTIVE IN A WAY AND IF IT MEANS HAVING TO COME BACK. WITH SOMETHING BETTER THAN I WOULD BE VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE. IF IT MEANS WE'RE GOING FORWARD WITH THIS THAN TO BE ABLE TO GO AND LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN FIND A FIND PROTECTIONS IN THE FUTURE. TO PRESERVE THESE JOBS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME FOLKS THAT REALLY REALLY DO BENEFIT FROM THESE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD NOT MAKE IT IF THIS BILL GOES THROUGH. THANK YOU. THANK M. S. GRAYSON MISTER PATTERSON YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF. I RISE TO JOIN MY VOICE IS WITH OTHERS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES HERE ARE UNINTENDED. AS THEY MIGHT BE SHARED SHARON AND I HAVE. BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN. THE COMMUNITY THAT SERVES AND CARES FOR AND LOVES THESE INDIVIDUALS AS MAYOR FRESNO I OFTEN VISITED THE ARC WHICH IS A MAGNIFICENT WONDERFUL PLACE. AND TO WATCH V. INDIVIDUALS THERE WERE WORKING. MEMBERS I SAW THE JOY OF THE WORK. AND I SAW THE JOY. OF THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM. AND I CAN REMEMBER ONE SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE WHERE. AND THESE WERE MOSTLY THAT DOWN SYNDROME CHILDREN. THEY WERE COLLECTING. NUTS AND BOLTS AND SCREWS AND THEY WERE PUTTING THEM ON A TEMPLATE. SO THAT THEY COULD PUT THEM IN A BAG. THAT HAD THE RIGHT CORRECT AMOUNT AND TYPES OF SCREWS. THAT LOCAL HARDWARE STORES. WOULD HAVE ON THEIR SHELVES. ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THE JOY. OF HAVING ONE OF THOSE SWEET DOWN CHILDREN. HOLD IT UP TO ME. AND SAY LOOK WHAT I DID. LOOK WHAT I DID. SO I UNDERSTAND IN THE PERFECT WORLD. THAT THERE COULD BE A LOT MORE MONEY. GOING TO THAT TO THAT JOB. BUT AS WE HAVE HEARD. FROM THOSE WHO CARE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. FROM OUR. DISTRICTS IN FROM OUR CITIES. BE CAREFUL HERE. I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BUT I WOULD. JOIN IN THE CALL. THAT IS THIS IS SOMETHING WE WANT. TO HELP THE PROVIDERS AND HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS. LET'S NOT RISK TAKING THE JOB RIGHT AWAY. LET'S FIND WAYS. OF SUBSIDIZING AND PUTTING MORE IN THEIR PAYCHECKS. AND SO THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE IS ELIMINATED AND THEIR JOY OF WORK REMAINS. THERE IS PATTERSON MS VALDERS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS- UNFORTUNATELY I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THE NET COMMUNITY CURRENTLY HAS AN 85% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND I FEEL THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO FURTHER THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR THE SPECIAL NEEDS NINETY COMMUNITY FOR WELL OVER A DECADE. AND IF ANYTHING THAT I LEARNED IN MY NONPROFIT EXPERIENCE IS HOW MANY OTHER NONPROFITS OR STAB WISH JUST TO SERVE THE ADD COMMUNITY I HAVE MET PARENTS THAT HAVE STARTED VINEYARDS NOT TO MAKE MONEY. BUT TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN FOR A PLACE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AT THE END INDIVIDUAL FAMILY MEMBER WITH A DISABILITY TO WORK NONPROFITS OTHER COFFEE SHOPS NONPROFITS THAT ARE BAKERIES. THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR PROFIT THEIR BUSINESSES THAT GIVE GOD INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AN OPPORTUNITY BEYOND SCHOOL TO MEET WITH PEERS WORK WITH PEERS AND MAZING OPPORTUNITIES AND I FEEL LIKE SINCE THERE IS NO EXEMPTION THIS BILL FOR NONPROFITS WE'RE NOT ONLY GONNA KILL JOBS BERNECK WE'RE GONNA KILL MORALE WITHIN THE IDT COMMUNITY- AND. AND I STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. MR LEE YOUR ATTACKS. THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY SPEAK ABOUT HOW POOR AND I THINK THIS BILL IS THIS BILL ALREADY HAS AN IMPLEMENTATION. TODAY WHICH IS PLENTY OF TIME AS WE'VE SEEN HOW MUCH THE WORLD CAN CHANGE N A COUPLE YEARS ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY MADE THIS CHANGE IN THIS PROGRESS THAT WE WILL BE JOINING OUR STATES LIKE A HANDFUL OF STATES LIKE WASHINGTON OREGON TEXAS VERMONT AND ALASKA THAT IS THE LEAGUE OF STATES WE ARE CATCHING UP TO. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AND COMMON ALI WITH A LOT OF BILLS WE TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THAT AS A BORN IT IS FOR THE JOIN THE PURPOSE THAT A WORKER FINDS INFO AT THE WORK. A WAGE. IS NOT ABOUT HOW THE WAGE TO WORKERS NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY VALUED EMPLOYER. IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THAT VETERAN PLAYER VALUES THAT WORKERS. AND IF WE VALUE ALL WORKERS NO MATTER HOW THEY WERE BORN. WHATEVER THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE SHOULD BE TREATING THEM WITH EQUAL RESPECT AND THAT IS HOW. WILL HAVE THE EQUALITY THAT EXISTS IN THE SOCIETY TO TREAT THEM WITH THE FAIRNESS DESERVE. AND ALL WORKERS OF THE RIGHTS THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE- DRIVER THANK YOU. MEMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BAY RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES RIGHT NOW. HE'S. MISTER BRIAN YOU RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I WILL KEEP IT BRIEF. AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. SOME YOU MAY KNOW THIS THAT I GREW UP BY A FAMILY THAT. THE FOSTER CARE FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS. THANK YOU TOOK ON THE HARDEST CASES. SPECIAL NEEDS CASES ESPECIALLY MY LITTLE BROTHER HAS TROUBLE POLICY MODEL BROTHER HAS AUTISM AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN TOUCHED BY THIS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. FOR ME THIS BILL A SIMPLE. WE DON'T PAY PEOPLE SOLELY BASED ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OTHERWISE I'D BE A LOT OF WOMEN MAKING A LOT MORE MONEY. WE DON'T PAY WHITE FOLKS MORE THAN WE PAY PEOPLE OF COLOR JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T PAY. PEOPLE WHO COME FROM CERTAIN COMMUNITIES LET ME PAY FROM OTHERS I HEARD. TOM OF MY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT IF YOU PUT SOMEONE WHO'S ESS ABLE. WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S TYPICAL I BELIEVE WITH THE WORD THANK WHICH TO THIS PERSON I WOULD ARGUE TO PUT A BLACK EMPLOYEENEXT TO A WHITE POTENTIAL EMPLOYEE. YOU GET A SOMEWHAT OFTEN WE DON'T ALLOW FOR THAT DISCRIMINATION. WE DON'T ALLOW FOR THEM WE SHOULD ALLOW FORD IN WAGES EITHER WE DON'T TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS ABLE. WE DON'T PAY THEM DIFFERENT AND IF IMPLORES GONNA CHOOSE PROFIT. OVER PEOPLE THEN THAT'S MORE WORK FOR US TO DO. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED FROM THE BANK WE GOT FOUR YEARS TO ROLL THIS OUT IMPLEMENTATION AND WE CAN WE SHOULD GET THIS RIGHT. BECAUSE TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WORKING RIGHT NOW TO BE ALLOWED TO BE WORKING AND THERE ARE A LOT MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE BY THE WAY FOR LESS ABLE TO CALIFORNIA. WHO NEED JOBS THERE'S WORK FOR US TO DO. BUT I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE WE DON'T PAY PEOPLE LESS. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE LESS ABLE WE DON'T NOTICE THE MONEY'S WORTH. BASED ON THE ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. THERE IS BRYANT SEEN DISCUSSION OR TO. REMAINING MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE I WANT TO FIRST RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL TOPIC. AND IT'S A TOPIC IN A AREA THAT I'VE WORKED ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS ON BEHALF OF THE DISABLED COMMUNITY. SO OFTEN OUR APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MAY TURN ON. THOSE WORKERS WHO WE'VE HAD CONTACT WITH. SO THE LEVEL OF FUNCTIONING FOR SOME DISABLED WORKERS. IS HIGHER AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT TODAY AND THEY'RE BEING ABUSED BY THE SYSTEM AND THEY CONTINUED TO BE ABUSED BY THE SYSTEM SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THAT'S WHEN THIS WAS ESTABLISHED. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE OTHERS WHO FEAR. CAPS BECAUSE OF THE CAPABILITIES OF THE PEOPLE THERE ADVOCATING FOR THAT THEY'LL GO WITHOUT. BUT I HEARD SOME THINGS ON THIS FLOOR THAT LEAVE ME A LITTLE DISTURBED AS WELL. THESE ARE CHILDREN THESE ARE ADULTS. THESE ARE OFTEN FUNCTIONING ADULTS WITH THEIR OWN APARTMENTS WITH THEIR OWN LIVELIHOOD. AND WE HAVE GROUPED THEM ALL TOGETHER AND ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO PAY LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE AND I WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE WE'VE ALL HEARD THE STORIES RIGHT NOW TO DATE TODAY. THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS WHO CANNOT FIND WORKERS TO FILL THEIR MINIMUM WAGE JOBS. AND YET WE'RE SANE- BUT IT'S COMPETITIVE AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PICK SOMEBODY WITH DISABILITIES. SOME PEOPLE AND CONGRESS WILL SAY THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BE BRING MORE PEOPLE OVER IN A VISA RIGHT BECAUSE WE CAN'T FILL OUR MINIMUM WAGE JOB SO WE'RE GONNA BE WE'RE GONNA BRING PEOPLE FROM A COUNTRY WHERE THAT SEEMS LIKE A BETTER WAGE. WHEN WE HAVE WORKERS DOING THE WORK HERE TODAY WHO AREN'T BEING PAID A MINIMUM WAGE. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE WAY WE'RE VIEWING. ADULT INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK WITH DISABILITIES. I UNDERSTAND WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO FEEL FULFILLED BY WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE DOING IN THAT DAY. WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING FOR A PAYCHECK WHETHER THEY'RE DOING VOLUNTEER WORK WHETHER THEY'RE DOING ACTIVITIES AND WE NEED TO INVEST IN THOSE PROGRAMS SO THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA HAS. A FIELD DAY. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WORK IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK. AND THE DIGNITY OF SHOWING UP EVERY DAY AND DOING A JOB THAT HAS TO BE DONE BY SOMEBODY. IN EXPECTING THAT EMPLOYERS PAY THE VERY LEAST. A MINIMUM WAGE. IT IS NOT NINETEEN THIRTY ANY MORE. IT IS TIME WE STEPPED UP TO THOSE PROGRESSIVE STATES LIKE TEXAS AND ALASKA AND START PAYING PEOPLE FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE GETTING RID OF THE SUB MINIMUM WAGE IS BOTH IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PLATFORMS IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR YEARS SOMETHING WE'VE ALL SAID IS IMPORTANT. IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN CONFLICT WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE AND WE HAVE ADVOCATES ON THE FOR THAT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR MORE PROGRAMS FOR BETTER PROGRAMS FOR OUR ENTIRE IT COMMUNITY. BUT THERE THIS BILL WAS SPONSORED BY. AND ADVOCATED FOR BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE IN SUB MINIMUM WAGE JOBS. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HURT BY THE FOURTEEN C. EXEMPTION AND FEDERAL LAW THAT'S WHAT THEY THEY APPLY UNDER. AND IT'S TIME WE LIFT EVERYBODY UP AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHO ELSE WE HAVE TO- AT YOU KNOW ACCOMMODATE CREATE PROGRAMS FOR SPEND MORE MONEY ON I'M FOR THAT. BUT LEAVING PEOPLE IN A SUB MINIMUM WAGE JOB WITHOUT THE DIGNITY KNOWING AND THEY KNOW THIS IS NOT PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID A MINIMUM WAGE THEY KNOW THAT CAN YOU IMAGINE CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING TO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY IN YOUR DOING THE JOB SOMEBODY PUT IN FRONT OF YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING IT AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID. WHAT THE LAW SAYS YOU PAID ABLE PEOPLE TO DO. THINK ABOUT THAT DIGNITY. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT DOES TO THE PSYCHE OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT AND THEY DO. THESE ARE NOT CHILDREN. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENTLY ABLED. AND I THINK THEY DESERVE A MINIMUM WAGE. I THINK IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE SHOULD EVEN BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. I IMPLORE YOU FINALLY FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP UP AND JOIN THOSE STATES WHO'VE ALREADY DONE WHAT IS NECESSARY AND PHASE IN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS PLENTY OF TIME TO PHASE IN A MINIMUM WAGE AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF US ON THE FLOOR TO ENSURE. THAT WE'RE PROVIDING ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIVEAU. CORPORAL SAID ABOUT. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS THAT A VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. HOWEVER IS FIGHTERS AT ABOUT. THIS CONSULTS WITH THE CALL. THERE IS A PREPARE TO LIVE THE CALL ON. MS AGUIAR-CURRY. FILE ITEM NINETY TWO SENATE BILL FOR. CORPORAL POST. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS SHOULD WISH TO VOTE. THIS TAKES. FIFTY FOUR. WELL CLOSER ALL TIED ABOUT ICE FIFTY FIVE NO SEAT ON THE URGENCY HIGHS FIFTY FIVE KNOWS A ON THE MEASURE THE BILL PASSES. MEMBERS WE ARE. GOING TO MOVE TO TAKE OUT. FILE ITEM ONE A. ONE FILE ITEM ONE ON ONE. THIS IS SENATE BILL. EIGHTY ONE. SAID ABILITY WORKER PROGRAM. SENATE BILL EIGHTY ONE BY CENTER SKINNER AND OTHERS FACULTY TO SYNCING IS BACK QUE HAN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TO PRESENT SB EIGHTY ONE BY SENATOR SKINNER. THIS BILL PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO JUDGES ON SENDS ENHANCEMENTS CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE HAS OVER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY CENTS ENHANCEMENTS THE CAN BE ADDED TO A CRIMINAL CHARGE. ENHANCEMENTS TO BE CLEAR NOT ELEMENTS FOR CRIME BUT THEY'RE ADDITIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE WEBSITE CAN INCREASE THE SENTENCE LENGTH FOR AN UNDERLYING CRIME. SO LET ME BE CLEAR MEMBERS WHEN SOMEBODY GETS ENHANCEMENT STACKED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER THEY'RE SERVING MORE THAN THE BASE TIME THAT THEY SHOULD BE. I'M SERVING THE SENTENCE AND THE CRIME THEY COMMITTED. NOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH SB EIGHTY ONE BECAUSE I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAD RESERVATIONS SENATOR SKINNER HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION REGARDING THEIR CONCERNS. AMENDING THE BILL TO ELIMINATE THE PRESUMPTION THAT THESE ENHANCEMENTS SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. THE BILL NOW PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS AND- LEAVE IT IN THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE WHETHER OR NOT TO REMOVE THE ENHANCEMENTS. THE COURT IS TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE UNDERLYING TRAUMA. MENTAL ILLNESS. WHAT WE HOPE THE COURT DOES LOOK AT WHEN DECIDING WHAT THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCE IS. AND THOSE ARE GIVEN GREAT WEIGHT I ALSO WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR. THAT THE COURT CAN AND DOES UNDER THIS BILL LOOK AT. WHETHER THE DISMISSAL OF THE ENHANCEMENT WOULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY. AND IF IT DOESN'T ENTER PUBLIC SAFETY THEN THE COURT IS ENTITLED TO. AN TO WELL UNDER THIS BILL. PUT THE ENHANCEMENTS ON TO THE CRIME. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES MEMBERS IT ASKS A JUDGE TO LOOK AND SAY DOES THIS PERSON DESERVE THESE ENHANCEMENTS. THESE MANY MORE YEARS ON THEIR SENTENCE THIS DENIAL OF FREEDOM. AND IF THE ANSWER IS YES THE JUDGE MAY GIVE THEM BUT IF. IT WOULD BE RACIALLY UNJUST. IF THE PERSON SUFFERS FROM MENTAL ILLNESS THEN THE COURT IN ITS OWN DISCRETION CAN REMOVE THOSE ENHANCEMENTS. WITH THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION HAS REMOVED ITS OPPOSITION AND IS NEUTRAL ON THE BILL. I WANT TO REPEAT THAT SB EIGHTY ONE DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY ENHANCEMENTS AND IT DOES NOT LIMIT JUDICIAL DISCRETION. IT PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO JUDGES TO HELP INSURE PENALTIES CLOSELY REFLECT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EITHER. DAVIS BURKE A HAND.
