OF A THERE'S A COUPLE OF CHANGES

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.728
IN THIS BILL FROM WHAT IT WAS

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:36.896
LAST YEAR BUT THE SAME MOST

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.532
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTFUL CHANGE.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.900
IS THAT LAST YEAR HAD A

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.135
DIFFERENT SPONSOR.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.736
LAST YEAR MY SPONSOR WAS A

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:44.504
MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.440
EQUALIZATION NOW MY SPONSOR IS

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:48.575
THE TREASURER OF THE STATE OF

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.110
CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME PERSON

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:55.014
FIONA MAW.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.082
I READ THAT YOU CAN PROVE JUST

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.651
THE FEELING OF AWE THE ORIGINAL.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:00.854
SO JUST REAL QUICKLY A PERFECTLY

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.421
FOR THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.522
COMMITTEE.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.391
HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACE

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.326
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.894
BASICALLY BECAUSE THE FEDERAL

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.163
GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT MARIJUANA

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.932
IS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG YOU CAN'T

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.668
TAKE THE PROCEEDS AND PUT IT IN

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.136
THE BANK BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERED.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.705
SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A BANK THAT'S

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.406
PART OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM THAT

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.541
DEALS WITH THE CLEARINGHOUSE

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.276
ALIKE OR FEDERAL RESERVE

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.210
INSURANCE.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.478
AND IT'S IT'S LIKE TAKING

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.280
ILLEGAL DRUG MONEY SO THEY CAN'T

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.349
DO IT SO WE HAVE -- I DON'T KNOW

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:30.984
THIS FOR FACT STANDING TOTALLY

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.819
MISTER MCGUIRE WHO SERVES THE

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.554
NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE TOLD

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.522
ME THAT HE THINKS THERE'S TWO

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.623
BILLION DOLLARS BURIED IN

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.557
BARRELS UP IN NORTHERN

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:38.658
CALIFORNIA.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.059
FROM THIS BUSINESS BUT CERTAINLY

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:40.960
IS A LOT OF CASH I MET A

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.562
GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO MY OFFICE

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.697
IS IS HE'S GOT A TRACTOR TRAILER

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:45.532
WITH FORTY MILLION DOLLARS CASH

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:46.332
IT.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.700
YOU KNOW DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.002
WITH IT SO THE QUESTION IS AS A

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.638
GOVERNMENT WHAT DO WE DO IN OUR

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.706
GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO ON THE ONE

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.041
HAND TAKE WITH THE VOTERS HAVE

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.076
SAID BY A WIDE MARGIN.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:58.478
INSTEAD WHAT WE WANT NO ONE TO

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.412
BE LEGAL.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.914
AND IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.549
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:03.416
ROLE AND HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.384
MONEY.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.585
HOW DO WE PAY PEOPLE HOW DO WE

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.787
PROVIDE SAFETY FOR WORKERS IN

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.022
THE SYSTEM HOW DOES THE

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.223
GOVERNMENT?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.191
GET GET ITS TAX MONEY HOW AS THE

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.693
TREASURE WILL TELL YOU WE CREATE

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.261
RECORDS AND THE LIKE SO WE CAME

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.196
UP WITH THIS KIND OF HYBRID

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.465
APPROACH WHICH WE CALL A LIMITED

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:20.767
CHARTER BANK.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.902
IN ESSENCE WHAT IT IS IS THAT

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.203
YOU CAN ONLY USE IT FOR A COUPLE

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.972
OF PURPOSES IT DOESN'T SOLVE ALL

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.607
THE PROBLEMS BUT IT SOLVES PART

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:28.975
OF THE PROBLEMS.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.476
AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHECK

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.612
THE IDEA IS YOU OPEN A BANK

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.047
ACCOUNT.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.915
ARM IN EUROPE ML ON A COMPANY

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.116
WHATEVER AD YOU CAN PUT YOUR

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.819
MONEY INTO THAT PLACE THERE'S

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:40.386
NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO BANK

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:41.888
BRANCHES AROUND CALIFORNIA

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.690
THEY'RE EMPTY THAT ARE CLOSE. TO

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.191
THE IDEA OF JUST RENTING THOSE

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.993
FOR NEW COMPANIES THAT WANT TO

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.627
BE BANKS IS PRETTY SIMPLE

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:48.795
THERE'S IT BE PRETTY EASY SHE'S

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.229
NOT REALLY EXPENSIVE GONNA TAKE

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.197
A LOT OF TIME.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.566
THE IDEA IS THAT MOVE URGENTLY

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.335
THIS BILL MOVED ALL THE WAY

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.135
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE LAST

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.237
TIME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.706
THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS CHAIRMAN

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:01.174
JOINED ON AS AS A CO AUTHOR IS

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.342
PART OF THIS.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.443
BUT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.378
BASICALLY FROM EVERYTHING I CAN

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.013
DETERMINE INTERNALLY.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.947
COMMUNICATED WITH THE OTHER

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.515
HOUSE AND TOLD THEM AN

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.017
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I WAS

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.652
TOLD TO HOLD THE BILL BECAUSE

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:13.620
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:14.153
THAT THEY FELT THAT THE

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.460
REGULATORY SIDE SOME OF THE

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:20.960
OTHER ISSUES WOULD BE TO

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:21.628
CHALLENGE.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:22.695
AND I'M I DON'T DENY THAT

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:23.162
THEY'RE CHALLENGING.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:23.730
BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS WE SEE

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:24.397
STORIES OF PEOPLE GETTING KILLED

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:24.731
AND MURDERED.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.065
IT AND THE LIKE BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:27.533
ARE CARRYING CASH IT'S JUST

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.068
CREATES A HUGE PROBLEM SO WE'RE

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:30.470
TRYING TO CREATE UNTIL THE

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.071
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:34.073
LEGALIZES THE STUFF.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.541
A PLAUSIBLE IN A ROOM

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:36.776
INTERREGNUM IF YOU WILL AND

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:38.645
ABILITY TO HOLD THIS IN THIS

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.480
TWILIGHT ZONE THAT WORKS.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:41.714
AND SO THE CONCEPT IS WHEN YOU

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.950
GO TO A NORMAL BANK YOU KNOW YOU

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.451
PUT YOUR MONEY IN AND THEY PAY

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.120
THIS MUCH INTEREST DOWN HERE AND

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.488
THEY LANDED OUT HERE AND THEY

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.123
MAKE THEIR PROFIT ON INTEREST.

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.724
YOU CAN'T LEND MONEY HERE SO

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.326
WITH THE WAY THIS BANK ID IS A

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.761
C. IDEAS IF YOU OPEN AN ACCOUNT

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:55.862
OF MY CAR TO THREE THOUSAND

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:56.929
BUCKS A MONTH TO HAVE AN ACCOUNT.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:58.131
WITH US LESS MONEY THAT WOULD

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.033
COST YOU TO HOLD THE MONEY PAY

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.134
FOR SECURITY DEAL WITH ALL THE

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.534
STUFF.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.536
AND THEN WHAT WE WANT TO DO TO

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:04.771
BE ABLE TO PUT LESS CASH IN THE

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.439
SYSTEM IS THAT PEOPLE ARE PART

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:08.007
OF THE SYSTEM CAN USE A CHECK.

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.275
OUT WHAT WE CALL THEM THE CHECK

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:10.977
IT HERE'S AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:12.478
WHAT WE'RE SAYING ON THE CHECK

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.113
IS THIS CHECK IS ISSUED.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.416
BY THIS BANK DEPOSITS ARE CASH

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.784
ONLY LIMITED CHARTER BANK OR

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.819
CREDIT UNION AND NOBODY ELSE YOU

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:23.856
COULDN'T TAKE THIS BANK AND SAY

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:25.792
PUT IT. TO TO THE TO ME THIS

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:26.626
CHECK AND PUT IT IN CHASE OR

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.027
BANK OF AMERICA ONLY YOUR BANK

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.862
OR ANOTHER BANK SO NOW THERE'S

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:31.864
FOUR AREAS WE LOOK TO FIRST.

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.000
IF YOUR LANDLORD LANDLORD HAS

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.735
THREE TENANTS EACH ONE'S PAYING

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:36.703
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A MONTH ALL

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.471
THE SO THEY BRING IN TWENTY FIVE

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.540
THOUSAND ON THE FIRST OF THE

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:41.541
MONTH NOW THEY CAN WRITE A CHECK.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:42.075
AND TAKE THE MONEY NOW THE

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.076
LANDLORD TO DO TWO THINGS ONE

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.377
THE LAND I CAN OPEN ACCOUNT AT

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:45.378
THE BANK.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.547
OKAY OR TWO CAN GO TAKE WHEN

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:48.715
THEY WHEN THEY HAVE A PROPER

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.083
ABILITY TO DO IT TAKE ALL THE

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:51.784
CHECKS THE BANK CASH THEM AND

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.720
THEN HAVE THEM OR HAVE THE BANKS

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.521
WOULD ARMORED CAR TAKE THEM TO

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:55.822
THEIR BANK.

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:56.689
SECOND.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.024
I'M A PLUMBER.

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:00.626
I HAVE -- I'M PROVIDING --

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.095
SERVICES TO A BUNCH OF THESE

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:03.663
COMPANIES THAT DO YOU KNOW D

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.530
THE PIPELINES FOR THE PLANTS

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:05.264
RIGHT.

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.666
IS IT MY DRIVER HAVE TO PICK UP

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.202
CASH I GET PAID FOR BY CHECK

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:11.070
AGAIN OPEN AN ACCOUNT HE JUST

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:14.173
MANAGEMENT OF RISK AND THE LIKE.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.808
THIRD -- THE THE IDEA OF

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:16.876
GOVERNMENTS WHICH IS THE MOST

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:18.411
IMPORTANT WE SAW LAST YEAR

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.779
NUMBER OF BUDGET CHANGE

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.281
PROPOSALS I MET WITH THE HEAD OF

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:23.316
THE E. D. MR HENNING.

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.384
TELLING ME HOW HARD IT IS TO YOU

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:26.786
KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COUNT

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:27.520
THE CASH.

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:28.821
THEY GOT UP WITH BULLET PROOF

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:29.756
WINDOWS AND THEY GOT TO PAY THE

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.124
HIGH WHICH OLD ACCOUNT TO MOVE

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.625
THE MONEY NOW THE SUDDEN.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:35.161
YOU CAN PAY THE MONEY TO TO TO

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.129
TO YOUR AGENCY'S WHETHER TO

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.363
STATE AGENCY OR WHATEVER WHICH

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.698
HOPEFULLY RESULTS IN US GETTING

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.066
MORE REVENUE TO PAY.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.001
AND LASTLY ALTHOUGH WE PUT THIS

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.302
BACK IN THE IDEA OF TO INVEST

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.138
WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE IF

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:46.139
YOU HAVE MONEY IN THE BANK AND

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:47.173
YOU WANT TO GET.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.574
INTEREST WELL YOU ONLY INVESTING

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.511
pSOLUTION SO IT'S CLOSE YOU ONLY

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:52.812
CAN TRADE WITH YOURSELF.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:53.980
AND THE SECOND THING IS YOU HAVE

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:55.515
TO A PRIVATE INSURANCE CAN'T USE

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.949
FDIC YOU INSURE THE DEALS AND

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.017
WE'VE TALKED SOME INSURERS ARE

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.318
WILLING TO DO THAT.

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:00.453
SO THE IDEA IS TO CREATE THIS

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.121
LIMITED CHARTER BANK AND THEN

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:03.689
ULTIMATELY WHAT WE DID THE ONLY

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.158
OTHER CHANGE OTHER THAN THAT WE

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:06.292
HAVE THE TREASURE NOW.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.127
IS WE ADDED THE SUNSET PROVISION

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.228
OF THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:10.296
BANKING COMMISSION ON THE

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:11.931
DEPARTMENT'S COLUMN OLD GUY

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:13.299
REMEMBER THE OLD NAMES.

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:14.267
WHO'S THAT WAS VERY SMART THEY

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:15.234
DID WAS A SUNSET PROVISION

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.036
MEANING THAT ONCE THE FEDERAL

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.638
GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO DO THIS.

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.173
WE'VE GOT A SHOW A WINDOW THAT

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:21.574
THESE BANKS HAVE TO THEN BECOME

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:22.909
REGULAR RISE BANKS THEY CAN'T BE

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:23.910
THESE LIMITED CHARTERED BANKS

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:26.045
WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE THERE

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:26.579
WERE ONLY INTENDED TO BE A

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:27.680
BRIDGE.

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.148
AND THE LAST THING ABOUT IT IS.

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:30.216
THESE ARE NOT MORE GOVERNMENT'S

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.185
GONNA GO AND HAVE TO OPEN A BANK

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:33.252
AND STUFF LIKE THAT THEIR

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.987
PRIVATE INVESTORS AND SO THE

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:36.155
IDEA BEHIND CREATING LIMITED

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.857
CHARTER BANK WAS.

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:38.825
SOMEBODY COMES UP IN PACE WITH

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.359
SOME ACROSS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.094
TO START A BANK THE INVESTMENT

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:43.830
BANK THEY GET. THREE OUR

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.364
CUSTOMERS FIVE HUNDRED CUSTOMERS

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:46.799
THEY GOT A GOOD ACCOUNT AND THEN

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:48.167
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.002
BIG ENTITIES GONNA COME IN BY A

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:50.436
MOB.

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:52.338
AND THE KEY THE GENIUS OF THIS

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.239
THING THAT I THINK THAT'S SO

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.207
IMPORTANT A SIDE WHICH THE

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:55.608
TREASURES GONNA TALK ABOUT OF%

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:56.676
KEEPING RECORDS.

00:07:56.742 --> 00:08:03.850
IS THAT WE DIDN'T INVENT

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:04.517
SOMETHING BRAND NEW.

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:05.384
WE BUILT THIS WITHIN THE

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.086
FRAMEWORK OF BANKS SO FOR THE

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:07.854
SHOP OCCASION STAYS THE SAME

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.454
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OBLIGATION

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:09.121
STAYS THE SAME AUDITING

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:10.223
PROVISIONS STAY THE SAME.

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.057
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS WHOLE BODY

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.625
OF LAW THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED WE

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:13.426
COULD HAVE WRITTEN THE WHOLE

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:14.894
THING AGAIN BUT WE PUT WE

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:15.995
BASICALLY INCORPORATED BY

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:16.963
REFERENCE TO THAT YOU GET

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:18.264
TREATED LIKE A BANK.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.498
SO THAT THEN WHEN THE RECORDS

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.267
AND HOW IT'S BEING TAKEN CARE OF

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.368
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN CHART A

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.636
CHASE COMES OVER AND SAYS THEY

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:24.704
WANT TO BUY.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.006
SAY THE COMMA EURO DANK BANKYOU

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.709
KNOW AND A YOU YOU GOT -- TWO

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:31.010
BILLION DOLLARS IN DEPOSITS THEY

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:32.511
WANT TO BUY THIS IT'S EASY FOR

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:33.412
THEM TO BUY BECAUSE THEY

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:34.680
UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM BECAUSE

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:35.615
ALREADY BANKING.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:37.450
THE IDEA WAS GREAT THE SHORT

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:39.252
TERM SOLUTION. TO IT THE FACT

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:40.553
THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN A

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.121
WAY THAT WORKS IF TEN DIFFERENT

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.322
BANKS COME TOGETHER THEY CAN

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:44.423
HAVE AN AGREEMENT AMONG

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.925
THEMSELVES TO TRADE CHECKS.

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:47.059
YOU KNOW AND THEN THE LAST THING

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:48.628
OBVIOUSLY IS IF SOMEBODY IS A

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.129
CUSTOMER FOR MARIJUANA THEY CAN

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.565
OPEN UP AN ACCOUNT YOUR BANK PUT

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.066
A THOUSAND AND GET A CREDIT CARD.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.067
AND THEN THEY CAN USE IT AT YOUR

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.435
PLACE AND THEN ONLY

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:57.870
ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFERS AGAIN.

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:00.439
D. RISKING CURRY GENERAL PUBLIC

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:01.941
SAFETY.

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:03.309
LESS COSTS.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.378
EASY TO ROLL INTO A LARGER

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.246
PICTURE BETTER RECORDS WITH THE

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:13.219
TREASURE WE'LL TALK ABOUT ALL

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:14.887
TURN OVER HERE NOW.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:15.888
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:16.489
MEMBERS AND CENTER HURTS FOR

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:17.023
GLAD TO BE BACK HERE AGAIN

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.090
TALKING ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:19.926
TOPICS -- WHEN I WAS ON THE

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:22.461
STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION -- I

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:24.730
FOUND OUT THAT WE STARTED TRYING

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:26.766
TO COLLECT CANNABIS REVENUES --

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:27.733
BACK.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.069
STARTING IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.171
BUT IT WAS REALLY INCONSISTENT

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.639
BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T A LOT OF

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:36.342
FOLKS -- REGISTERING TAKING UP

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.311
THEIR SALES TAX PERMITS --

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:39.779
UNDERSTANDING HOW TO EVEN --

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:42.214
COMPLY AND SO WE SPENT A BETTER

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:44.016
OF TWO YEARS GOING AROUND THE

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.652
STATE TRYING TO ADVISE.

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:48.254
OF FOLKS WHO HAD A DISPENSARY

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:51.490
ABOUT THEIR OBLIGATION TO FILE.

00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:52.725
FOR THEIR SALES TAX PERMITS AND

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.527
ACTUALLY HAVE TO FILE EITHER

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:56.529
QUARTERLY OR MONTHLY -- THE ONES

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:58.497
THAT DID NOT -- THE WAY WE WOULD

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:00.833
AUDIT THEM IS WE WOULD STAND

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.568
OUTSIDE OF THE DISPENSARY.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.371
COUPLE DAYS OF THE MONTH I'M

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.739
SUPPOSED TO BE THREE DAYS OF THE

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:07.873
MONTH AND THE COUNT HOW MANY

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.042
PEOPLE WENT IN WE WOULD.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.711
ASSESS A DOLLAR AVERAGE DOLLAR

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.079
AMOUNT MAYBE SIXTY DOLLARS PER

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:15.314
PERSON WE WOULD EXTRAPOLATE BACK

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.515
THREE YEARS ASSESSED INTEREST

00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:18.184
AND PENALTIES AND SEND THEM A

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.251
BILL AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:19.919
WOULD PAY.

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.988
OUT NOT VERY EFFICIENT SO IT

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.956
STARTED ME DOWN THIS ROAD OF WHY

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:25.658
DON'T THEY HAVE BANKING -- VERY

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.994
HARD TO AUDIT.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.696
CASH BUSINESSES AS WE ALL KNOW --

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.031
BUT RIGHT NOW MANY OF THESE

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.466
BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE A BANK

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:35.001
ACCOUNT SO THEY OPERATE AN ALL

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.203
CASH -- THEY DON'T GIVE US

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:40.706
RECORDS AS AUDITORS WHEN WE GO

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:46.012
IN AND AUDIT THEM NECESSARILY --

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:46.712
BUT BE.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:47.680
PROBLEM IS THE SAFETY

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:48.647
REQUIREMENTS OF MANY OF THESE

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:49.448
FOLKS WHO DID PAY THEIR SALES

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:51.384
TAXES WOULD COME TO OUR BOARD OF

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.618
EQUALIZATION OFFICES WITH.

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.787
DUFFEL BAG SOMETIMES SUITCASES

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:57.990
OF CASH -- IT WASN'T SAFE IT WAS

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.459
INEFFICIENT FOR OUR EMPLOYEES TO

00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:01.427
BE COUNTING.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.562
ON THIS HIGH AMOUNT OF CASH AND

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:06.165
NOW WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:07.700
SIXTY FOUR IT IS EXACERBATING.

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:09.735
THE SITUATION BECAUSE NOT ONLY

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.370
ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO PAY THEIR

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:13.606
SALES TAXES BUT DISTRIBUTION TAX

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:15.041
CULTIVATION TAX.

00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:17.343
AS WELL AS ANY OTHER LOCAL TAXES

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.744
THAT MAY BE ASSESSED ON THIS

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.780
INDUSTRY SO WE THINK THIS IS A

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.149
GREAT A TEMPORARY SOLUTION --

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:25.351
WENT BACK TO DC TO TESTIFY

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:26.719
BEFORE THE BANKING HOUSE

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:29.188
SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT A MONTH AGO --

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:31.123
BILLS ARE STARTING TO MOVE A

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.491
LITTLE BIT LIKE THE PROBLEM

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:34.126
UNDER BILL -- BUT IT'S GOING TO

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:35.728
BE SLOW GOING SO -- WE

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:37.196
DEFINITELY NEED A SOLUTION

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:38.764
TEMPER SOLUTION UNTIL THE BANKS

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:43.335
OPEN UP -- THEIR DOORS TO THIS

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:43.602
INDUSTRY.

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.371
THANK YOU.

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:45.971
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.773
MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.941
THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:50.543
ASSOCIATION AND NUMEROUS

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:52.511
INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS -- TO

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:54.380
CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGED BY THE

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:56.415
LACK OF ACCESS TO BANKING IN

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.384
CALIFORNIA -- THE ASSOCIATION

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.119
HAS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:01.187
AND THIS IS GENERALLY ONE OF THE

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:02.588

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:34.486
WE'RE REDUCING OUR EXPENSES

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.888
BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE THEY

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:36.688

THE BANKING INDUSTRY FULLY OPENS

00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:22.134

BECAUSE YOU KNOW FEDERAL LAWS

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.810
WERE.

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:33.278
BILL A CHALLENGE HERE IF THEY

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:34.379
DECIDE TO SOME.

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:37.182
SO YOU HAVE YOUR MONEY IN A BANK.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:39.084
IN A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THERE

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.786
ANY PROVISIONS IN YOUR BILL TO

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:42.721
PROTECT [inaudible]

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.656
A DEPOSITOR.

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:46.525
IN CASE THE FEDS COMMAND.

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:49.761
AND TRY TO SEIZE ASSETS EVEN.

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:51.263
MAYBE SEASON THE ASSETS OF

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.932
ANOTHER -- DEPOSITOR NOW BANK SO

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:55.267
THOSE ARE PROVISIONS IN THAT

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:56.335
BILL THAT GUARANTEES AND

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:58.570
PROTECTS YOUR GUY HIS MONEY BUT

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.806
THERE'S THERE'S TO PROVIDE A WAY

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:03.208
HOW COULD THERE BE -- PROVISIONS

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:05.143
TO PROTECT THOSE WHEN IT GOES

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.545
AGAINST FEDERAL LAW THAT'S THE

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:08.247
OKAY FIRST QUESTION IS WE'VE

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.381
NEGOTIATED WITH THE

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:10.782
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE.

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.484
AND AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE'S

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:14.887
MONEY WE'VE CHARACTERIZED THAT

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.622
AS A TRUST FOR THE STATE'S MONEY

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:18.090
SO THE STATE OWNS A PIECE OF

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:18.790
THAT MONEY BECAUSE THE TAX

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:19.725
REVENUE.

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:21.226
SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE SAID THAT

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.728
THAT MONEY WE WROTE THE

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:23.896
PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:26.198

GOVERNMENTS INTERESTS SO AT

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:28.066
LEAST.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:28.901
OF THE MONEY THAT'S THERE LET'S

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:30.469
ASSUME IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:31.603
LET'S ASSUME TWENTY THOUSAND OF

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.005
ITS STATE STUFF WE SOUGHT TO

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:34.973
PROTECT THAT THAT IS NOT THE THE

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.642
THERE MONEY IT BELONGS TO THE

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:37.509
STATES THAT'S A PIECE SECOND

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:37.976
PIECE.

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:39.344
IS THAT'S WHAT'S INSURANCE IS

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:40.712

CREDIT CARD.

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.322

TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO AVOID THE

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:54.860
CASH THING BUT NONE OF IT'S

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:56.628
