Select committee of boys and men of color. Normally I begin the meeting by traveling down but I don't see my gavel. So I guess this is now officially my gavel. So this isn't an official hearing. Of for the Calvin state assembly. I would turn it over a little bit to. My partner and justice are Todd Gloria who. You all know because he's from here. And so. This hearing today arm is identifying the improvements in the status of boys and men of color. Living in San Diego. I'm really excited about being here at the San Diego continue education north city campus. NCC I don't know in CC means of multi purpose room. This is. A beautiful facility. This. Everyone here in San Diego should be extremely proud. Of not only what's going on here with the continuing education but the fact that. We've put in. Money in efforts to build a magnificent facility so I. I wanted wanted thank. De Michelle gray for for wealthy in here. Today our it's deathly and are up to be here. A de select committee on boys and men of color. And the reason why I like to mention is have been around for for almost ten years. And we like to mention that because Sandra Swanson in the assembly lower care bass. And who speaker and then. A jumper as. Really form to select committee boys and men of color Sandra Swanson who is from the bay area recognize that we were city far too many. After American Latino API and now we've added native American boys and men of color. School to prison pipeline and we needed to address it. Of no disrespect two the president United States. Brock Obama. What we know so you have now? Not note specter held. California. First. Actually. Actually have hearings. Really start doing things. For they was a to sons and brothers that were started with the Barack Obama. Glad he. Started in the start on national level. But you should all be proud. That this discussion started in California and I wanted make sure that you knew that. This is my first hearing of this year. We've had six hearings. Mike. My tenure is every two years so which side. Do thousand seventeen two thousand eighteen. We've had for several first we had our first meeting in San Jose. Seaside and Oroville. We had our first hearing. With a Republican member. As the host of committee. We're not like Washington we actually talked to the other side. And we have to work with them in a constructive way. But most important which. Some ways we we we. Embarrassed about but we had our first hearing on native American boys and young men. Which incidentally you need to know what's the most watched online viewing of any hearing out of all the selected maybe Harry's that we ever had. And in fact that it brought tears to a lot of individuals I. Because it was so impactful. And and learning to challenges of native Americans I think would not only very formative. Of I think it also ultimately opened our eyes that would probably needed a whole lot more a lot sooner. So I I am extremely proud to be. Chair but I'm also proud. To. To welcome assembly member I know you calling him counsel. Ali known as assembly member Todd Gloria he's a great Allen. And de um California State Assembly he actually understands. The issues that only impact his community but other disadvantaged communities. When I vote. All I know you have to look over I know how it's going to vote which is the right way. Which is for finale for you. When he's in Sacramento you just need to know. All he talks about is making sure San Diego is taken care of and you should be very very proud. To have a measure assembly member in Sacramento what that assembly member Todd Gloria. Thank you Mister chairman. They could is kind was Mister chairman and welcome everyone to this hearing I am glad to see so many familiar faces. To share what we've done in San Diego what what we must do. With our chairman. And. Chairman John Sawyer dozen is very kind say those words I appreciate him tackling the five and talk to us. On this is level commitment. That the legislature has I'm working on this issue. And high. Gratefully toast this. In San Diego I know that my colleague it's. Some of them are doctor Shirley Weber will be here soon aye she nine account tag team today's hearing you know when you're at home you got a lot of demands your time but I really want to be here. To so the seven eight assembly district support for the select committee on you would be surprised that. I sought out an opportunity to be on this committee I as the legislature's first native American Filipino water weekend. Assembly member. I feel like I'm holding on the minute color piece a pretty good. And and I recognize our special concerns within our community. At their structural historic le challenges that we've yet to overcome but. Our chairman and our committee. Have been given the opportunity by the voters of our districts to make some important changes in as I was chatting with many of you before I the chairman came to. Star are meeting. You know hearing from you that concerns around mental health around recidivism outcome of justice reform. I will tell you these are issues that we talk about every day in Sacramento and Casey we get to act upon into. And there are a number of things any of you who may saw. A governor brown state of the state address. Yesterday he's been a significant amount time talking about issues about come on justice reform and try to set people up for success rather than continual failure. And some of you live that out and I really appreciate the stories that were shared with me individually help some of you will share that with the committee. As we go for the hearing. But the stories are important because they help to change policy and that's really why we're here today not just an area grievances but a real sharing the stories. They can help us to craft legislation to improve people's lives athlete quick one. In our chairman was a leader on this particular issue. Of banning the box and some of you probably know what that means a lot of you probably that in a situation we've applied for employment. All you got a good interview but you can get the job simply because of a criminal background. That you couldn't clear it's interesting that you know if you don't ask that question on the front end. You tend to be able to get the job. And so California we vote we voted that we approved in the governor signed a bill to eliminate the box of that question is not asked. When you apply for the job you can work that out afterward if it off of an offer employment is made. Aye best transformational for helping people actually get jobs to be able to make the rent a to meet your responsibilities. And that's legislation that came from the community from folks who've Y. live this life and walked in the issues that people like Reggie and I are here to listen to. So that we can find the next piece of legislation that will improve people's lives and give our men and boys of color a fighting chance. At succeeding in this. In this world I wanna shout out to junior like things in the very back you told a very compelling story about that changed its possible people believe in you and I you given the assistance. We won't have a lot more engineers in California that's of this committee's about unsexy you honest with your time. This afternoon get my apologies for when I have to leave once a doctor Weber rise. For this important work and appreciate cynical shown up in force to let our friend from the north you some LA but will hold that against him. Before. For giving us the leading the committees here to this important issue that is up to not too often not discussed. But increasingly is heard in the halls of the state capitol and I'm gray Friedlander voice to making. Make yourself heard today submits chairman thank you again for all the time and trouble god bless you friend drive back to LA tonight. That really shows commitment. In his wallet you know a we have a very good chairman here who's going to make sure that we get more good legislation passed up to Sacramento. Thank you very much thank you touch that and. And ends so that you know. That did these discussions. Sometimes can turn into reality bandbox is one. Laws a will for defiance no longer young boys just be in. Thrown out of class* nilly by by school administrators are teachers. But I want you to know this year. I've been going all over. State and in. And I was hearing from a lot of young people about the mental health. Of our young people in that kind of drove the men. To some some situations that are not that good a young man came to my office. I just got out of prison after being then. Jew now for three years and in. Three years in prison ask him what he did. And he said it was for assault. So I said what happened he said look my parents one was on drugs only to jail my. My brothers sisters rider. Selling drugs are part of gangs so I really didn't have anybody at home. I was hungry so I gave me five dollars I get to school my stomach rumbling. Kids are laughing at me you. Just gonna leave class and go and I get something to eat. While is grabbing his use that Taco Bell la used just about every time we talk about it as is grabbing. His burrito hand reaches over. And he just naturally. Pledges back and hits a police officer in the face. It's not I've got assault. No. Solana police officer Mayes cookbook at. So the show management three years and you about three years in prison. Because he was hungry. Think about that because he was hungry. Have because we don't have a school psychiatrists social worker. Or anybody can deal with their mental health needs. So I. He said look I've been traumatized he said you know you talk about post traumatic stress disorder. Citing have that I posed dramatic St. This order. And so I decide to write a resolution and it. Was to put it will tell you if you do resolution I can make a resolution that dishonest purple and I'll get through. Frazier Friedman no matter what this one took six months. Because the professionals just descended on me and told me I couldn't diagnose anything because I'm not a doctor I don't have. I do know what goes on in my community but I can't. Diagnosis. So they want to call it ace is a trauma informed care assiduous fine I just need. Figure out a way to take care of. Even even though they denied us having a hundred million dollars for boys and men of color. Because a prop tool nine. We can't do that anymore we get. Direct funds directly to people of color. So we decided. That this year after I got the resolution through. That we would ask for a hundred million dollars. Post traumatic stress disorder to help boys and men of color and girls and women of color. Who've been traumatized in there disadvantaged communities to help them deal with that so they can better able. Matriculated on a link to to school but to be able to. Deal with. Situations and and. In a communities lot better. I'm telling you that because Raskin for that hundred million dollars today. Your testimony. Could be a pivotal. Example of why we need. So that's why it's so important for us to get your testimony is so poured for us to go all over to state. And not just good LA Sacramento that we actually reach out and have you up. It to us so with that. Will have our first panel. On youth development. I have a Kevin Malone. San Diego organizing project. Author Soriano youth empowerment. Luiz over here Louise. Lucio. A SCO es I ask I a tech high and Ernie Silva SIA tech. It's good my hat. Yeah. Floor. And you have to share my. And also to make sure I. Introduced Ryan Lindsay who's from other colleague the office of. Alright Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher is here. But. And calmly got. Office of assemblyman Brian Maienschein. Them Mr Maienschein is a member of the can. So whoever wants to go for. I'm I'm first. I it's good to see all your faces out here many of you I know. I'm Kevin Malone I've had the privilege of working with the San Diego organizing project for. More than fifteen years. Our work is to build powerful organizations in congregations. That. Begin to live out their faith in public life. And I'm part of that peco California network that does a lot of work. Around the state. So we were there when this this commission got form more than ten years ago and what I was afraid of is. Is that. It would be a commission where impossible problems go to disappear. And I'm happy to say it doesn't feel like that at all that some good work has been done through this. Normally I wouldn't be here today. My job is to train leaders and clergy to to. To be the person who speaks Arabic I got challenged by my African American friends. To be the face today. Because it's important for white allies to occupy the space and named the the evils of structural racism and white supremacy. That under gird this entire conversation and. We need to be the ones. Changing it to. And we need to be in the spaces and and be brave enough to say we're not there yet. And it hurts us to. I like what more fee it's in the mid and from the movie the matrix said that the matrix is cage for your mind. And racism operates like that. Were all in cages the cages look differently. And we're learning more and more about. That that. The. Nature of that cage at through conversations like these. And this one just like noodles me I I can't stop thinking about it and you all know it because your experts and I see so many faces I've worked without here. But but drama can be passed on genetically. Lake. Noodle on that for a minute and and and imagine what we're really up against. This is a long term work and it burns in me the last sixteen years as. Director and organize your nasty O. P. this is banned in the center of our work. The cradle to prison pipeline before people are using that language I think we were. I'm also here because we have failed. I think we've made some strides in the last decade. So I can remember being in the meeting of criminal justice reform advocates in in Sacramento fifteen years ago. When I said the problem is prop thirteen reduce investing in communities caller. I laughed out of that room. I was also a rumor said that hate if we don't if we don't talk about money bail reform we're never going to get anywhere I got laughed out of that room to. People said we can't fight that and and I'm happy to be here to say that we have taken some good strides. And for me this is a. Some to give me many men. Thank you. A third of my son's friend. It. Another third or in that it. Jobs another third written military. And. So. I know that I have failed. This system is failing. Everyone. And I I going to I only got three minutes that's not a lot of time. My work with a lot of pastors so give me an extra minute. So make make no small plans for they have not the magic to stir one's imagination that from Daniel burns and I think we don't dream big enough. I I think we need bigger dreams if we're really going to address the violence of poverty and racism. We need bigger dreams and and we need to start speaking to those dreams and naming the evils that we're up against. So we must talk about universal basic income. But is it we must begin to think about. Changing how we employ people we must begin to value teachers and pay them better and hold them more accountable. We all know these things. We need universal high quality preschool. We need to have been. Universal healthcare and we need to talk about the social determinants of health that determine where young people of color going and we must name that we must invest in our use we must. Invest in these poor neighborhoods criminal justice reform your all experts on it we designed a system that incarcerate incarcerate incarcerate and there's never conversation about real ability. It's the second you walked in somebody gave you a hug and said you're forgiven now go forgive yourself and repair your relationships what if we had that kind of system. In California Pico California's leading a conversation that's called heat. If we're really going to transform law enforcement we must hire differently we must equip differently we must hold the system accountable differently and we must train. We'll differently what if every prison guard was a trained mental health experts. And what if what if every police officer had two years of training. And. And and tendencies towards aggression were identified right like they do in Finland. I know I'm running out of time here we we've done some good things prop the great doctor Weber. And and all of her work and we must do the bail Reform. We must continue to expand alternatives to detention they work we must expand restorative justice programs like mid city can has they work. Ian Gordon created with our help a youth development office here that's massively under funded we must expand work like that and diversion. Last thing I'll say I'm running out of time there's a good program and to the best. South Bay community services we want a promise neighborhood grant out. And it is working. It is working investing in families investing in and their jobs investing in the school's wrapping these communities up with a massive in and out inundation of services changes outcomes. But you have to do it all. Wrap up please. Alright. I have more ideas for good things that are working but I'm sure there's going to talk about it. Thank you. I am a boy of color. I am a man of color. I'm a boy that was raised in the juvenile justice system. And also a man that was raised into incarceration. Presented by plan. Now I'm a family man I'm a father. I'm a community service deter you know founder of you think part of it. My story began. Five years ago. I got out. A did fourteen your screen went back in out of the system. In out violations got to wear the terms. I got out. And I began to work on my so that pulls dramatic. Trombone. I began to identify were to come from and I began to heal from it. I had a compassionate. Provisional officer by the name of Jay mac which is a midi mac. Cheese. Husband. And he showed me compassion he showed me love you show me war. So be opportunity to get on the right direction. I was on AB one or nine. And I was able to get off in record time six and a half months. I discharged my first time being able to get away from this is. So I got away from the system. And an unfortunate situation where my son ended up in mercy hospital. I weighed and the. When I was there are officer leave John Cooksey which was. Used to work for the mid city police department. And I seen his compassion his love that he was showing towards my son. And so. I let him talk for like five minutes but he made the connection. And then I told him my story he invited me to our mid city police department are in city heights. And. My wife and I we took a leap of faith and we walked in there. My nervous system was out of whack is the first time I have been to a police department on these terms. But I Nguyen my give it a shot so we walked in there. And I seem of Sir John Cooksey and our Dana brown and see wrapped around me and showed me love. Compassion made me feel welcome. Within a month. I was out in the community. City heights. Every Sunday for two years straight what Krystle sound upon I. We're at the Roth apart. Every Sunday connecting with the. Boys of clutter men of color grandmothers of color and just on a grassroots effort. Which is reaching out to our community. Within that time. Were able to build relationships the most important the relationships of the community think gauge of the community. Matt what pro bass and. Build relationships with them. County the city. And we formed and we grew. And we'd we filed for the. Nonprofit which is in the process right now. But our works and our fruits of our labor. Paid off and. Through the Latino coalition the department of labor. They were able to see work grassroots community work is being done in the community. So you from parliament and of project aware stood out. As being a to grassroots organizations. There are working with our boys of Conor and our men of color. So we began this grant were approved for it we got the grant. A for a three year process and we work with the population of a. Eighteen through twenty four so we provide workforce job opportunity. Education resources for these young adults. And we also reach out to their families as well. And but the the beautiful thing about it. Is that before their grant even began. For the salary began. All these efforts. Were put into the community the relationships were bill. With the young man. The boys the grandmothers of color to will now. The grant. It's easy. It's easy to do. It's easy to be able to recruit or pass our numbers were exceedingly. Of you know these are individual community mentors with they've experienced what records under jackets. But we're doing it we're we're doing it and we're getting. The job done where it needs to be done. And we're reaching out so although referrals our community because for the community by the community so there's great work. Happening in. Incendio county and of Regina I partner up which is let the no after gin American coming together. To help our boys of Conor so. I believe been dreaming dreaming big and at the same time challenging him holding people accountable that need to be hold accountable. Their leadership. That doesn't.

That means of the students that we server typically five to six years below grade level their very low income and the predominately Latino and African American.

Two thousand here in San Diego the job corps and we have another. Fifty found that if I graduate the last couple years from. From our our program. What? What the the other piece of this and the the the the data that you know is out there? About re engagement and what it means for the community. Our numbers that nineteen hundred and some means that we're putting back into San Diego region seven point what over seven point one million. Per year and the gross regional product. It's not just about it's important it's not just about building families rebuilding communities it's about what we're doing for the economy and for the and for those families.

So say they gave me the opportunity to earn credits at my own speed. Which I am so grateful for the offer that because one cigarette they then want to be able to get a per job a better paid which is a. They're paid which is what it is going to contribute to. The economy itself us until. California. Institution like this. I have to continue. Because. Perhaps county new on the fish then there are making a great work with all the students. In fact I am so glad that I found that school in my darkest hour. I remembered that I was looking for a better paid job that I didn't have a high school diploma. And. I have always been a person that likes to learn likes to. Not to be in the same spot. To move on. To. Keep growing up up like keep keep growing like like a person. And. That's it I'm so close le once they finish in the school library to transfer ticklish. I would love to study for Ringling sheath right now I am. Stunning Japanese. Wish it could be kinda hard but I love it I like to communicate that we in another language. All I can speak in English I lap of languages type. Love his country. When I see people. I don't see colors I answered races. I see launched people that it's working hard to gather. To make. Healthy Philip this country. To make this country stronger to. Going on. To. Develop skills off other people's and. I think. The fifth. Gloria. I request that I would just ask the members the panel and. Thank you by the way for. Your testimony and for what each of your respectively doing to advance the concerns of this committee. On Kevin I think was a. Are a light touch my life and policy priorities I'm some of which I think we may tackle this year specific bill reform. Was curious maybe for each of your question of what would be if you were in our shoes what's the number one legislative issues would want us to tackle in. With Isabella form needed I think money go formally grandstand or hopefully many of you understand what that is but. Of for each of you individually since you occupy different spaces of of of this issue. And what would you ask us to go back on Monday up the capital and work on space. Whether there's two there's two things of. Violence said one but okay. That the individual with the record. Breaking that policy like Kern you we have a planning its of two we have all top probation public safety. A part of that that planning is to and when have a document that we're going to be able to present. And that is that people would live experience records that are a bit it. In the community and doing great work that they be given the opportunity to. Be able to get contracts and Exeter and work with the boys and men of color. As far as specifically for this grant. Were blowing this thing up the park and our biggest need. For this you for young adults eighteen to twenty four. Has been. Half of them are homeless. Their culture for. Thank you. John how I'll go ahead and jump into. So again my of my. Lance is re engaging. And so what I what I think the most important thing we can do is to provide a. Incentives new resources tattooing to increase the partnerships between schools and other community services so that you can address harmonise homelessness and mental health issues and all the rest. Their work we're trying to do hodgepodge but we need resources and and more support from the. But I got a long list of the been shortened Ivan. So there's. Really I didn't get to this year but there's good work happening here to blow up you know how I just said that I don't mean blown up I mean scraping it. And completely transforming juvenile hall into a. So I think I don't know what state enabling stuff lies in there. But the other really big priority is the marijuana tax. That their resources the twenty percent that goes to law enforcement. Percent that's supposed to be focused on use. Gets targeted into a use reparations model. The drug war differently impacted communities of color. These resources need to be invested in those same. You in season. Would. Did you want to add. Yeah. I am I'm sorry mom I got I got along they but yeah it's it's I just want to support our third one of our goals locally. To support emerging organizations led by those most impacted in led by people of color. It is very difficult for the small organizations to find support at the county. And the state levels and we need to figure out how to do that if. With think a panel on and I'll just leave you. With this. The assembly on the chair of public safety. Chair of public safety budget is Dr Shirley Weber. And my. The other like our counterparts is a need to Skinner who's over both budget and policy public safety. A we have a goal. And I've. Crafting a but do something. Said and. We've been saying that we. Before we leave. We want to do something it's never been done before which is close to prison. Never been done we building like crazy. We build a more than we build universities. A but we never close one. So we've we've readjusted it based on. What I'm hearing is? Maybe. We changed the facility. State of it being a prison will be education center a campus and and the nature I would love to talk to you. Each of you give us input. On as we reduced. The footprint of the number of people there Carceri difficult problems forty seven fifty said rehabilitation. How do we build these new facilities for education rehabilitation and? Homelessness and and so I would love to follow up if you follow that our staff on this again I think the path. So on our education panel. Would like to bring up Frank Harris and Luke would San Diego State University. Are masa de Niro Macedonia. Are. Are the aga junior. Is Valley at. Suelo de la Raza. And so de Sadat Ali African. Coalition workforce. I. I Frank in Luke first. Harrison would. Sandiego state. Doctor Weber. Former. The university. Weber here happens. Not that way. Well good good afternoon. First one. And I'll join you with my car. Both. Back here said it was state university. Mission college. College. Assessment lab colleagues CO. And we do work on on education. Thank you. We do work that focuses on equity related education issues that impact. The status of boys and men of color up. Primarily focused on community colleges but not exclusively focus on communicable edges. So I became the data share some the days we've been learning from that work for for nearly a decade. I'm exhausted eyes as well as to discuss a potential recommendations and next steps about. Things that we can do as a community are you know perhaps with the support of our assembly members that are here. To really reverse. Some adjust the perverse patterns. Of of inequity that we see that impacting boys and men of color and education lose going to start. And then I'm going to pick up after. So we have a lot of different projects going on in terms of research that we're doing with one just highlight to that we felt were practically relevant here. First with. Doing a lot of work looking statewide at men of color including housing insecurities was of mines. With the previous comments but specifically looking at community colleges if we think about. Of post secondary education the vast majority of our men of color concentrated not in. Places like San Diego State University or any of the UC's our in our communicative. So it serves as a primary pathway to post secondary education. Unfortunately like many others educational institutions. There access is not always synonymous with their success so it committee called the struggle to be able to do that. A one of the reasons that we see. At one of the factors that we see is influencing their success is up food insecurity housing of security. So in our most recent report the. We had come out. We found that nearly. Twenty three percent. Of black males struggle with food insecurity now there's different types in ways that that can be measured. About lot we look at specifically it our work is the most acute form of food insecurity so students who. Are struggling with where they got what they money. And there's different ways in which is measure but we look at the most acute form. So we have about you know again to it twenty three percent so nearly a quarter. Who struggle with that challenge we look at housing and security which can include a wide array of things to come? Some was student whose couchsurfing Suguna Karsavina closet in some sort of untenable living situation we're looking at forty eight percent. So there's a number of reasons why does rates are so high. But they are very high those issues are also typically. Aligned with other challenges we know that for for example students who experienced food insecurity. Seventy five percent of them three quarters are also an experience housing and security. To also very likely been experience transportation challenges as well as a major employment barriers so you're talking about a population that is experiencing pretty significant challenges and one of the. Things that we do is we go around we talk with a lot of educators about what they can do to better support their success. And a lot of it begins with perception stay a an educated much Houston and back and the classroom comes in a little bit late. You know we know that student may have all these different things going on and their very presence demonstrates their resilience and the fact that they're committed in they care. The educators sees them I like seeing. Their always like their lazy they don't care they're only here for the financial aid so allowed where we deal with our issues of. Perception of barriers. The other thing one mention there's a report that we've been doing. That's going to come out. In February so very soon that's a partnership between our center the seal commute because equity assessment lab. And blackmail institute well what Tyrone how did you silly looking at this. In case twelve in California I know this probably lot of folks near done work around. Exclusionary discipline issues in general they fall into two different categories in terms of exclusionary discipline students or suspended. And score out of school or students who are expelled. We are been looking at statewide data. And we see that of the statewide average for suspensions is three point six percent. For black males its twelve point eight percent. The highest disparity if we start looking at different levels so those who are early childhood or middle school and high school. Is actually in early childhood where they are five point six times more likely to be suspended. We also know that when we start doing to segregation's we see really high rates among those who are foster you. Those who are homeless. And we also in our report tried to identify places where this is occurring so. If we're thinking about how total suspension numbers behinds places are usually are large urban counties. So we're thinking about places such as Los Angeles Sacramento county San Bernardino county. But if we think about heists expansion rates it actually occurs in rural counties where there's less rep representation of. Of black males and the more likely to be isolated and have experiences where based upon these rates are being clearly being targeted. Yeah so we're regard to recommendations are you know they're December that we thought of first to address recommendations related to food housing and securities thank you. Are we have to continue to invest in the community colleges first and foremost recognizing that. For boys and men of color it's the primary pathway to a bachelor back to. That you know without that investment. You know the students are not necessarily going into see issues are you see S. attentions. If they're access in those institutions it's through to transfer so have to concede invest are the equity. By the side of invest been invested a committee colleges over the last couple years has done a lot to address concerns like food and housing insecurities among other things. So we opted to can you continue to see that as a worthwhile investment. In our state are will serve to think about. Investing with regard to facilities in committee colleges of things like residents halls meal programs childcare things that can help reduce the cost. Of attending college but also to help students meet other needs that impact their ability to to access I'm affordable food in affordable housing given things like have been free meals on. But think about our K. twelve schools we have free and reduced lunch programs. You think about how might that that same same type of. Program be implemented and a post secondary level. Again would regard to the suspension concerns that lieu talked about intensive ongoing professor development for the our teachers in our state is absolutely critical. Are so much of these disparities relates to things like on crutches bias and things like racial micro aggressions so we talked a lot about. You know that as it relates to life force where we have to have the same conversations about weight what occurred within schools. But we have to consider look at data and use data to inform drive these conversations as well. I don't think about some. You know statewide task force to focus exclusively on. Spigen expulsion at other types of exclusionary disciplinary programs. So with that. We're going to concluding allow other colleagues to share their remarks and hopefully have some twenty four questions and dialogue that much. Thank you I have twenty pages of notes that probably won't talk about anything I wrote down. I want a survey thing no. I was really excited when I pulled into the parking lot and I saw reserve that make I thought it was for me. And the other was a young man next to me and our cities this when we park on one of the speakers is it dollars solely for the politician. Swimming next about how reserve spot. I'm kidding I'm I don't need a reserve spy I'm I'm good. I. I always like to start with with some humor less just part of who I am. And. In our in our native. You're talking about the reservation in our native. American ways of seeing the world. Humor is sacred medicine. Without it we we just find more difficulty to function in life nam. Both of my brothers went to jail my father went to jail stuff for males I'm the one that. And we went for a night. None to my brothers. Finished. The ninth grade. When I got out of high school I had a fourth grade reading level had a fourth grade math level. Super long story short I finally changed my life like turn my life around I went to college I graduated from you. Steel is an honor roll student ash and even know what honor roll was when they sent me a little paper set out on a real student. And you know what that was. So. I think that's what begin. The work that our. I'm not gonna say me because there's a lot of people that that did this work that we started doing in the community. For many many years with that putting get any funding and. I know a lot of you in this room are in the same situation. With a give money to take kids through the reservation from the city or are we start a rite of passage ceremony it's over twenty two years now that we have liberty a rites of passage. We know everybody in this room knows that that we all go through rights of passage in our lives we go through them. Different stages so we provide a healthy rites of passage with our young men. The young Chicano boys and some of the African American boys we literally taken to the reservation for three days as there. Finishing their rights of passage they get a crazy Nick name just like because that's what we have to do. Is get crazy nicknames arm. But I think everybody's been talking about it is my the love this song the of. Was. Over my classes here the. Post traumatic stress disorder right I love that. And dom I think one of the things. Is helping them understand. Why their disengage helping them understand why they feel the way they feel because young people don't understand? Is that low I'm stupid ó I'm this all on that is sick. We don't. We don't have to tell though my their disengage. The key is to help them understand why this and they disengage I had a student a couple days ago so I need anger management. Okay what is acre. Well I don't know what is anger. Paying. Okay what is pains other and they just start they break it down themselves they start realizing that. They don't have to blame themselves that generational trauma. And and. Young people to start learning this it may th grade and sixth grade seventh grade we can start healing no young men they don't have to go to a therapist. Every single time we could do it in a circle we could do it the way our answers of it too in a for. About five thousand years you know who little bit before the war restorative justice came out restore circles. I'm so what I want and with this because I know my time going to come up soon. We know. That something happens to young men of color in the third and fourth grade we know by then we know that would have to get it to everybody here knows that. So if we're going to start talking about initiatives we're start time of funding. Imagine a real genuine one hundred percent campaign that says you know what. There's something happening at this age. Well I'm billboards bus shelters were weak genuinely are. Going to the root of the problem. Which is something is happening in some of these brothers already mentioned. Unconscious bias right. It's genuinely there's teachers in a measures that are afraid of our young people they're afraid of me and it's like I don't don't freak out I work here you know. Not the janitor but I I work here and. So. That it's real I know like it's that it's it's kinda humorous but it's real so. Imagine a genuine campaign will we start really attacking the root root of the problem what's happening because the majority where a little boys are going to tell me they go to elementary school. Something happens there. I still have yet anybody to pinpoint what really really really happens. And I myself racked my brain trying to figure it out. I've talk to every scholar you could possibly imagine may give me different. Their ideas right but we have to all the brothers that are here today. This is less started committee let's really genuinely figure out what happens because that's it. The plant that seed that corns coming out of the ground and. COR is not going to grow it's not growing so what would is it will kind of fertilizer do we need how much water does that mean. Right how close we have to have it away from the shape. We have to figure that out what's happening with their young men so. Like the like that other brother was say now he's around pastors around a lot. One the reservation we sit around our elders talk to three in the morning for four hours. And we're not allowed to move or not allowed to fall asleep. So believe me I could talk for a really long time is what's I'm used to that but thank you thank you. Alright thank. Good afternoon now. First thank. Chairman Sawyer assembly member Gloria. And. Give everyone here give yourself a hand of applause for all the great work you don't. And. Special shout out to the Californian down. Mark Tran in the back for. Being one of the one of that honestly one of the best private foundations to take this. Issue and make a top priority so. The California endowment and apply. I wanna. My name is Sadat Ali and. I found it African coalition workforce to. Foster economic growth and self sufficiency. Basically through you know. Underserved populations so providing job training. Employment placements. So we worked not mailing list. Refugees and immigrants and city heights. Will also get a lot of college graduates that walking. With the. Don't teacher you know some of the basic life tools in college so. I'm as the issue alumni also. So despite all the stuff that's going on in the news and in the media take. Special tabla boys and men of color. Before while. You know if they should with the law enforcement. And. Forget about education employment you have to. We what about how to survive in the street. With the you know the P. T. S. the you're taught what chairman Sawyer. So. There's a lot of issues when it comes to this population. And. That includes all of us that this panel. Clued myself I came I came to the US. In the mid nineties at the age of nine years old. I don't speak one word of English. I was raised in a single file full pan. Single market. With five other siblings. So. You see lots of you know with the fair we all have. Boys and men of color majority wealth in a single households. With with that said. You know. I was very fortunate enough to beat the odds. Because of. Likely my mom had a little bit of educational background from back home. So the kids education is. If one of the main pathways to opportunity. And this kind of the about education. I'm fortunate enough to work with high school students right now providing help three pathways. So local city heights high schools. We. Try to put the. Focus on. And the. Minority high school you. Get them interested in the health field. There's gonna be over two million health coverage jobs in the next ten years. So stuff like alternative pathways. Where? We can go to post secondary that only a four year degree. That only two. Given the options and educational when I say Hey there are other schools they can have to succeed in life. And that's the thanks to the support the Californian down some of the great stuff they don't need city I. And. So basically it's it's. Does a whole lot of money out there. A lot of money to send a was well. But not too many things being done. Terms of. You know there's two minarets a. Politics as usual. Out you know let's be honest little of ourselves if if. We have the local workforce development of region. Was a lot of money that can easily. You know. Fund so many of these great projects in this from. You know state politics as usual federal is even worse. So there are them the monies out there will need to keep. Talk about so many hands and and and and nam and bring in the south you know. Months after months. It's just about how do we align. Some of these great recommendations that were brought up here at this hearing. Which includes. Staying in the career path we trust. Who state level? That's one. Recommendation that's really helpful specially career. After opportunity. How do we? Leverage the local workforce dollars. In the community. The the we abolish the federal funds. For this young man. Things twenty four year old will. And at the same time. You know. Developing high agreements in the region. So a lot of these employers. For taking advantage of subsidies. Given employer subsidy. Subsidized terms of high boys and men of color. And it seems on. We can also take. That affect couple months ago. County of San Diego the mental health services that. Has a lot of money over twenty million thousand reservists. Hasn't been touched for years. And will you talk on a matter health issues and this population. You come out lack of employment if somewhat educational gap. It's almost decided pressure. Someone law enforcement. Portsmouth to others not be part of it. So the mental health services act that could be another component. Dollars that can be used in terms of. And we talked about it with county level. In terms of workforce development creating opportunities. So and at the same time going you know short term program certificate programs. I want to community college myself and it was really helpful. I think. With these to professors with their don't section one. Community colleges. One the folks on that in terms of giving them the resources they need. And. Making sure because a lot of young men of color bone. Too many colleges right now which is the right way to. Kind of figure yourself out before he entered the you know. Crazy four year world. Universities and stuff. So with that said. Very fortunate to be here and well I think everybody. Thank you. We're now joined by the assembly member Dr Weber on a fiscally ducked were more likely assembly. One they think person same person. Would you like to. Say a few words. Now just double you know. One assumes that what is in your hometown is easy to get to. A and that it's not because people assume that you're in the city so they keep one to meet with you. But I'm I'm pleased to be here today and I one thing my staff and and Mister. Jones Sawyer staff organizing this item off the chancellor has been by Constance hero via I met with her earlier. At noon and she was telling she's gonna come by and that she was very on it that you were in one of their facilities. We have an amazing community college here in San Diego and great leadership and so on as a young man was talking about his experience. Clearly. It's a reflection of the tremendous leadership that exists in San Diego but I'm just pleased to hear this is an important committee. That meets regularly and the issues are important and many of the issues have actually. Translated into legislation and that's what's important I sometimes we think these are just committees that meet will talk and meet and talk. But they don't miss Jones Sawyer in and private cheers have taken the recommendations and translated them into. Legislation and oftentimes the legislation is a in the house in the assembly of various committees members of the commission will respond to. The legislation is how it's going to affect I know most of our cultures. Many of you talked about. As you grow up become other young men young woman you. Whether after American African. Native American or EP I will seem to have these rites of passage. Unfortunately right now to write the patches. Or with gang members and drug dealers and they have their own rights. I even when we had our native American. Hearing a talk about sweat lodges. And I was all gung ho ready to go to find out it's seven days no food. Water and year. It is pretty rough and so on. DESY boil the sense it would probably need to read figure that before but I I do that and now I hear you have to listen to your elders to three o'clock at morning. Can't go to sleep. But this whole thing of before. Just whole school system promote justice systems society. Racism hit you. Back them before you went out to the force before you start hunting before you. We cannot put mentally prepared. Our young people to to be able to handle that by sitting with your elders are. Or for others. I've always wondered if we ever could. Recreate something like that so that when what is third grade. We go look a camp. You know what they're not read that third grade level we need to stop. And get back or you know they're there which means a whole lot of problem we need trauma we need to stop and no start. Dealing with that or as you city need housing they're hungry it is that something. That. Possibly put together a few. To. To to maybe start is healing because as doctor Weber said and many of you said. We've had a lot of hearing. And we've done a lot of things and now we need to start putting things inaction. After me hopefully the. The subsequent chairs and subsequent meetings are about implementation. Of things and so. I know that was a long thing but have you any of you ever thought at least on the healthcare. What we could do? The people better mentally prepared beyond. Okay thank you a so where you where you're talking about. Really briefly as we have a national group through though one is called the wisdom keepers of the national court by those that work. The wasn't keepers is a group of African American males. Native American males. Chicago males. From all over the country we've been meeting for about three years now and we that. The before the national composite works been around for over twenty years and we have implemented these rites of passages. Throughout the country right and. Now we are working with African American males and even some of our own tribes to bring back these rites of passage is a healthy rights of passage ways. Which help the deal with all the issues that we've been talking about so. There is a model we we actually did a presentation to president Obama. We did a presentation to have. So there is something already out there that we can use as a model. Adele all in with this for such a long time back check I get really excited like or maggots actually sit with some men that are doing amazing work because. A lot of times you. I feel so lonely working with young man because. The the resources are so I don't see any other so minimal and. A lot of times it's you. It's just you by yourself and. You know your out there trying to also trying to get a little money for this three taking the kids to eat your wife's that white you white you pay for the food and you know I mean it's like. Twenty six years she's put up with it you know but arm. So so it's just something to think about their is models out there we do have models that and we're working with you know with men of color who are some really powerful elders in their work throughout the country so. So if they're now it's a matter of building that. If it the thing that I would add on that I completely agree as a lot of good models which you know rites of passage models. Bob a lot of folks lot of folks in this room were doing. A lot of hard work to make it happen. I dearly weekend. So to get to them before they experienced alright so we can do a better job of holding. Educators accountable holding systems accountable. Because you know you. In many ways I think a lot of the trauma. Is is. Preventable. But we don't have good good systems are good ways to hold folks accountable. Serving young man in ways that would prevent them from experiencing a when the young man should have to. You'll be traumatized going to school. Think about that. But you know so many of our schools now do a better job of preparing young men. The a better job preventive for presenting a do for for life. Given the work force and so forth so I think it's. Got a sort of address it on on But all possible three to support the programs and you know I Daly knowledge them. But also not at the expense of holding. Actors and. Educators and police officers in the city accountable for for serving them the what if they should. Thank you have. Thank you could not have our panel. Thank you. And in our our final a final panel. At health. Daphne Watson the mental health America San Diego. Dana Richardson. A community health. Improvement partners. And Diana Ross. Civilian and Diana Ross. Mitt CD can. Definitely go for. Well I what I feel is an honor to be here today to speak to. Assembly members and the audience about the need to boys and men of color. Because. As it makes a mental health we know that one of every five adults someone every six children. Have a mental illness suffer from emotional trauma. The user cho that number is even higher. Because they experience in their exposure to trauma in their homes in the schools. And in that community. Just propel them. To live a life with. Many mental health challenge. I've worked in prisons I've worked in communities I've worked with. Many individuals and very settings I'm and I recognize that. Many of boys and men the colors received mental health services. Either through prison. Also institutional mental health institutional setting. Very little would. Of these individuals received a spectrum of prevention. Early intervention. Out patient care. And very little innovative. So. We really need the San Diego to really change how we do business. Related to these individuals and million provide quality services. But I am pleased to say the same vehicles on the path. As we are trying some innovative approaches. I kicked few key programs I I actually one myself and you see the gentleman with the. Father child shirts out. Those individuals who have many have come from its and incarceration. They got onto a fatherhood program which is really relational and mentoring. Up and has changed many I would and talking to them you see. How the program even though they at first didn't think was going to be anything? Made a tremendous difference in the lives. We also have a. Bit providing alternatives to kill pro and men alternatives to detention program. We work with kids who maybe early hitting the law enforcement really divert them. From long term involvement with the command just so. And I also have now surfaced that are going to homes. Working with the myth probation news and families in their home. So that we can address not only the issues that the children might be for. But all that family member the siblings and really help them develop of that equality mental health and. But really that's not enough. We know that we are only up to the tip of the iceberg. We he oftentimes people talk about having create his conversations with links to race or individual succumb. But I'm here to say we need to have courageous. Action. Not just compensation. Because oftentimes those conversations. Really just how like the problem. But they don't begin to address. So what does that mean as it relates to. I'm are funding or. Our issue Arab policy. We have to make them culturally relevant. I oftentimes so the cringe of people think cultural competence. Well that's for you internally. But culturally cultural relevance means you have to. Still only be able to relate to the people that are in front of you. And unfortunately many of our programs a services just don't do that. Weeks week retired people as. I'm it unresponsive. Well it really is that we didn't respond we didn't deliver appropriately. So we have to really make sure that the services that are dedicated services from boys and men of color. Not program the father the child. These men are trained by other men. We also help them to see. What can they do with individuals of their own race how they relate to each other? So we've had fathers minute who were older men. Training young amend. Each will have a gun a Carson. Help in the private jobs many of them helping them just a. Understand how they can lake to their wives or girlfriends. And you know something we did about little but the money. But we've served over seven hundred minutes. So it really has made a difference number one program but this should there are many programs. Or we should be expanding these kinds of programs in the relational way it works. So I would encourage us to really all of us have to be a part of the solution. And we have to do it in a way that's really meaningful. And really men of color have often been forgotten. Ugh ugh services mental health services. I'm not really here to really helping them within the positively. We have to change. Good afternoon everyone. My name is Dana Richardson work for community health improvement partnership organization where Sir it manslaughter term solutions to priority health needs. The collaboration advocacy and community engagement slotted be here with you and to share some thoughts under the health category. A specifically I'm here to share with you about a program that I co founded a co created. Back in twenty eleven called the resident leadership academy. This program was created in partnership with the county San Diego health and Human Services agency. Through the communities putting prevention work initiative which existed here in San Diego from late twenty ten to March twenty twelve. And this. Fast track initiative focus largely on obesity prevention. A couple of things I like for you to look out for in the moments I have to share our number one not describe for you what the resident leadership academy program is. How it has evolved and grown over the last six seven years number to describe for you how the are lazy and forums and empowers local leaders to make change? And number three a profile local level examples of community driven. Change influenced by the or lay and related outcomes. So the resident leadership academy as a ten session curriculum based public of leadership program that teaches residents were underserved underrepresented areas how to become health advocate for a lifetime. Especially as it relates to address an issue the public safety healthy food access an increase in the quality of physical activity opportunities underserved neighborhoods. As far as the curriculum itself their curriculum. Based training was intentionally designed as an educational journey that will ultimately lead to facilitating the self determination and mobilization of residents were under represented neighborhoods. Across San Diego to address their own public health issues and concerns. The curriculum begins with orientation to the environment. An overview of community building principles in the social determinants of health in this nucleus of learning we're building a foundation for action. In the participants general understanding that it is the environmental social and economic conditions that exist in our society which are largely culpable for the disparities and exit and inequities that exists in our community. We believe that environments matter and that we're essentially products of our environment and the health happens and neighborhoods. But building a foundation for action we move on to profiling for participants a number of evidence based public health focus strategies for the neighborhoods consideration of which strategies work best for them. And the development of the action plan for improving their communities health. The sessions include safe walkable communities crime prevention through environmental design healthy food systems land is community planning and leadership advocacy and policy development. And after teaching participants about these evidence based public of focused focused strategies we transition from facilitating not education sessions work sessions. With the participants were they identify group roles and responsibilities collect and analyze data develop action plans with a vision mission goals objectives an outcome measures and ultimately plan for conducting. A smart celebration which releases formal action plans in the community. Let us is a high level summary of a process which usually takes about ten fourteen weeks but please know that with our late we seize every opportunity. To harness an ingrained in the minds of participants to help happens in neighborhoods and that environments matter. And we capacity residents for action by imparting a very clear and simple framework. For improving health at the grassroots level focusing on public safety healthy food access and increasing physical activity opportunities. We believe the by first beginning with the fundamental and basic understanding of how to improve health at the grassroots level that the community naturally becomes more fundamentally prepared oppose. To address issues which fall outside of the scope of traditional health care services and western medicine here I'm talking about the importance of capacity adding residents. To address the social determinants of health. Which other conditions under which people are born live work pray play an age. Now that you have that as a background was talk about outcomes. And in just the last six years after the program's creation in twenty eleven I could tell you that this programs member replicated successfully. Over fifty times in this county reaching over a thousand residents and neighborhood communities throughout San Diego essentially launching. Dozens of community improvement campaigns led by residents themselves and somebody's examples include reclaiming parts from the threat of gangs violence and other illicit activities through park surveillance and reporting. Limiting alcohol outlook concentration and presents a disk Spencer reason marginalized neighborhoods. Building community through creating a maintaining community gardens and sections of the community which were formally blighted. Advocating for joy use agreements with schools and park poor neighborhoods to encourage physical activity opportunities just to name a few. Essentially these grassroots mobilization efforts represents a long term sustainable public of leadership and underserved communities which is ultimately what we need to improve the overall health status. And Hynde neighborhoods so consequently of San Diego. Announced widely known and understood that with every additional resident leadership academy graduate and the community that the health of San Diego and proves. And it doesn't just stop there in summer twenty thirteen my colleague and I created a train the trainer program which consists of four non consecutive days eight hours each day thirty two hours total. And four short years we've certified five cohorts totaling seventy three certified trainers that can effectively disseminate this model in the community. So consequently over the years the resident leadership academy family as grow exponentially in size to become an impressive critical mass of advocates some of us are council members some of us a mayor's faith leaders members of community planning groups. Middle managers and directors of local nonprofits assembly locally focused grassroots leaders were diplomatic consistent and committed to ensuring that the community prospective is hurt. By the. Local institutions and policy makers to make sure that all people have an opportunity for good health and good quality of life. I'll go ahead and stop there but what I can tell you is that. There are lays a mainstay in San Diego and that the good news is that this particular model Justin twenty eighteen will go national through contract with neighbor works American. Is process of Mississippi facilitated successfully cross culturally with youth groups and with intergenerational groups and this created the healing that we need in our. Thank you for your touch. Ross. Hi I'm Diana Roth and I'm the executive director admits he can. But I am also a fester and. Amman and I this issue is particularly important to me. Of for those reasons. It's taken me a long time to talk about that. Because it had a significant impact on my childhood and who I am today in. And that's the reality of of the trauma that my brother experienced and that. My family experience interfacing with the justice them. I here in San Diego. We grew up here immigrant family speaking Spanish. My brother into the system. Of pretty young me start interacting maybe age twelve I I don't remember exactly who was. In over twenty years ago I'm kinda old now. But to fast forward today what is he up to I I can't see that he's in college accounts that he's employed. But this is what I can say about him is that he splits his time in and out of detention facilities. And. Living on the streets. And in and out of. The psychiatric laca. And now my mom and her three year old boy. And I was still speak Spanish at home. And it's hard for me to look at him. And think of what happened to my brother and wonder if. This could happen to him even though I would try my hardest just like my mom dad. To keep him out of the system and and on path to to being a. Strong and all. So we've we've done a lot I think just the fact that this exists in that we're talking about this today. And that arrest rates are going down and that we're having these courageous conversations of after fee would say. But it's not enough because the trend still show that my son. Whose of a bi racial child. Is probably more likely to be on track to the path that my brother was in the eighties and nineties than on a path to career. If I could say one thing the power of our great state government is that you have the power to enact massive systemic changes. And to hold people accountable for implementing them. I would urge you to create policies that institutionalize restorative alternatives. In the juvenile justice system as well as our schools because we know that something is not working there. I would also urge you to insure that the money that doesn't needed for youth development. Resulting from prop sixty four. Goes truly into youth development because if you were to ask and and doctor Weber I know you know that if. If you were to take a look at how many like that might be used in San Diego. It's more likely to be designated to law enforcement. And. What we really know what's happening is you suppression? Also if you're great powers of influence I would ask you to urge local entities with their own taxation measures resulting from prop sixty four. To create their own youth development funds. And make sure that those resources and that money is goes into early childhood education because of some of my colleagues mentioned. We know that around third or fourth grade something happens. The education synergy project has done their research and if you look at where San Diego invest their greatest amount of money. It's not an early childhood education. Health cannot be and linked from this pattern. We know that kids who end up in jail or miss a lot of school. Have an increased rate of drug use HIV tuberculosis other diseases injuries violence PTSD. Trauma. And I could go on and on. Those two things are linked and there's a myriad of studies that say so. In Santiago alone while the rest is down. African Americans and people of East African descent African descent of in Sandiego. Continue to lag behind. Twenty three point seven out of a thousand people use continue to be arrested by. And communities of color it's eighty seven point six for African Americans and people of African descent. Twenty seven point two for Latinos and twelve point for for white. And when you adjust for population without means of over representation in the system and last time in school. And this a scary to me. As a mom. As my brother and because of what happened to my brother. If you ask my brother and you ask what his health problems are. He holds all of these he's constantly injure the few times a year that I see him. He uses drugs to self medicate. And. There are significant mental health issues that go without treatment. Programs like restorative justice. And. Early youth development have demonstrated significant positive impacts on some of these health outcomes. Including making sure that kids I go to school and get on pathways to career. They've also demonstrate and we know this from our own local study in San Diego. That recidivism is significantly lower with kids who go through restorative programs. So it's twelve percent. Verse says twenty to sixty percent in the traditional system. Victim satisfaction es up. And trauma and health outcomes increased. So again. I think we've done a lot but we have a long way to go. And this would be my wish list a if something were to be done. So I by. That and we may have a couple questions but. I just start with. So what I need to do to earn one of them father to child. Looking shirts. Ridiculous go badly. I mean of you work for I and I know he has got with how do you become a man of my word. And then move on so. And I I've graduated to. Examine debt. College money to to that have one on a cliff if a team. Pray guy gets a cut scholarship. But you you you mentioned. All poll where Sacramento a lot of times and that's why these hearings are so important. And that would broadcast it out of the P. see it are a lot of times. We have colleagues. Unfortunately some of these colleagues look like a lot of people lives in this room. That don't really understand restorative justice Oct Weber and I. We. We get a little frustrated sometimes. One more try this supply. But forget it other African Americans let you know why this is so important. And. And. It out today. Bob my nephew. Wasn't court. For felony. And and. It looks like he won't serve any jail time. And it looks so real probation and then at the end of February. Will work real hard to make sure you get that felony office regularly. Drop down to the misdemeanor. Of fortunate son you know how important that is. And what I tell them. A lot of them is we have these people in our families. I don't pretend like you don't. A lot of people pretend like they don't know who these people are. And where they came from and. And and that they don't understand the challenges that are out there. And so from so if ruling curry James. And so I. I kind of wanted. Talk about the programs liked it and I really met the father did. A child could my. The one to hear live it more because my. My nephew does have a child. Newborn. And I want to make sure he can be a man of his word. And. Father to child. And I know you said you you started on a shoestring budget. But it sounds like that's something we should. Maybe it should to in every city. Because is a lot like his problem is it wasn't of. A father. In his life. But in the home and I can see the ramifications of not. Having a male presence we're not even knowing who his father is. How that effective so if you could? Maybe going a little bit more. On that program I be happy too I'm the father the child program and this really is. An. A small program that was an afterthought from one of my. My county colleagues who said Daffy they got a little bit a pot of money but he going to do. And. I I really wanted to work with. A design something for men and boys that was going to be not just. A parenting program. But it was gonna be a transfer formative kind of process. So I did a search of a model. That. Really was working in Baltimore. Help men relate to other men and very relational. They have some connection with each other. And through that connection they get. Support. Rites of passage. Power to do better. And seen for the first time as a man. That's positive among other men's will have had the same experience. And then I hired two gentleman Mister Wooten. And Andre Jones and they created magic in the workshops. It was. Phenomenal. And if you hear and you speak to any of the men up there that's how you what it meant to them. And that now many of them are alumni. They have. She had the old ways but the children are so important to them. But now the family it's important to them and I'm motivates them to do better. It motivates them to stay strong and motivates them to to do what they need to do in the that and the next step and then no judgments there. We really but help these men see that they are on and they are valued. And there are people willing to support and help them. So through the program we have let me target medical. And we have intergenerational groups them have older men who grandparents of parenting that yeah grandchildren. As well as young men will just coming out of institutions. It's been effective. But it's only been a shoestring program. We because we don't look at the money will cut the end product what is the outcome. With insurance. And I would hope that you will talk to any one of the men with the teacher. You're gonna see. I I call it the magic that can be done. And if have to be done in every community every group every ethnicity hasta have that. Component. It would have to be done not not not in them what a damn way. S. B.. Real these men have to really see that you care they can. To all the nonsense and really value the work that. You're trying to do with them. And so. I want father chop of memory. I would really want to make a difference for these men for the first time everywhere. Innocent eagle we are making a difference but. It isn't easy. Because we'd Mister a shoestring budget but. We got will look into match again. We can make things happen anyway. And that's really the value of the program and we're going to try to Estado. Girls and women's program focusing on them their unique needs a very different from. And they have to be delivered in a very different manner. So. I'm excited and hopeful. I'm certainly with you sitting next to me. That we could make them. Thank you. Roughly how many minutes. We serve the with a seven hundred meniscal of of what time. Three years three three years about seven hundred. And your goal is to reach a mini. Well executed gave me a first goal was only seventy five a year. Leave exceed that by. Leaps and bounds so my got my goal would be the six about two hundred men. Of color at me for the next whatever number yes we can do this. Because it this a level of intimacy Evan in the groups we don't have a large groups of men so they can really relate we share with each other may have a curriculum that is really designed. To really. Empower them and motivate them to share with each other and also speak about those things that were secret. That they wouldn't share with other people now they can see it with a group of men who have the same experience they have. So it really opens them up to really understanding how they can improve. That's why we don't have any of them any females teaching the class. You have meant teaching the class. We also have men who and who have been in their shoes. Some of our trainers have had. Aye been incarcerated them sounds and how it can cheer. You also have it. Out gentlemanly Kiley from the county was a bale of. Came to the program so he sees it from a different vantage and brings that. To the group. So it really does work. And we have an opportunity to grow the programming and looking forward to hopefully do. So what is your budget for the program. We started off a fifty thousand. To fifty. No it's not a lot of money yeah I was asking that I mean no I chair the budget. Public safety so these issues. So it would be helpful if there. Polls of state forward because we do have the ability to fun things in this is a. Obviously and an important project that gets beyond us just giving money to the county and then they figured out what they want to do it. I've been kind of opposed to that. I'm more into of. Nnova of the never seems the trickle down in a fast enough great more in any significant amount of. So I'm more into finding things at work. And helping those things to grow because in that gives as a great a dividend coming back to the state. With regards to it and I think we are very interested in I've seen. I've read many of these programs that the state's main in Pennsylvania Philadelphia somewhere and they really are good programs that do work. And and I think we need to. We're looking at. At the state level. A lot of trying to figure out how we prevent recidivism. So the folks who have been incarcerated don't go back. And part of it is the connection in the commitment they have to the families that they left behind. And figure out how to relate to them because of that at some meaning to their existence outside of the institution. And so. Our governors committed to trying to figure out things of programs and and I am to at that point committed to making sure that that. Dollars we put into communities actually address the issues that a bear and a higher positive effectively so I'd be interested in seeing what you're proposal looks like. In the next hopefully the next week or so us sending it to my office because we are in the midst of creating a new budget for this year. I just want to watch it with. I would I was talking to the chief probation officer in San Diego and he was saying how they have to multiple problems. One young man was. Hip and has been in and out of prison he finally got. Really acclimated to the programs with in the prison and given the home. But he was afraid to go home. Because his home environment was the same as when he left. So they're keeping this young man inside because he. He really sees he feels Cup more comfortable living I don't. Not because he needed to be. Find any longer but the environment in homeless not brown so we really gotta do. Different types of work that really strengthens. And allows these young men and women. Even. Succeed even at in the communities that. So. For the group said edification that just like to say that. You know I I think there are a lot of these answers are in the room. So by the people there here in the panel and and speaking in everything but. Before we close I just have to say you know Kate can we. Try to focus a little bit more on leadership development. And getting back to what we use it in. Which is we used to teach each other everything that we know. And share the information. Everything. And and that's why I offer you the program that was talking about because that was twenty two years of public of knowledge. Them. Altruistic plea. Passing down to the people that I've never known before but is help me to build a relationship and create. Place of healing and growth. And and and and that's what blesses me today being able to capacity folks so that they can navigate the systems and take this knowledge. And and make a good life for themselves. Them legislators. Low when I got out of school. No I didn't go my pups got me in this program called and roads. And. In roads. While I was in university California riverside I mean for a four year internship because a permanent to pay. And so they check my grades every year. After I got out at UC riverside.

And I've learned so much from that program that even though it's been. Off wouldn't. Daffy gimmicks you say three years but I think it's more like five years. Okay and so it's been such are. Schools of education and inspiration from me that even though it's been many years I still come back. And most of the men will be through the program the continue to come.

And we just have to make sure that as they retire that we feel there possess. Individuals like that policy was ill now and rebuilding himself whose wife is still strong health advocate in San Diego he is to. And we also rely upon call floats in good guidance and information and help. So I just I just hope that we look at those positions women there.
