SO THE NORMALLY UNDER UNDER

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:07.311
SEQUEL UP. IF YOU WERE TO BUILD

A SCHOOL OR SOME OTHER FACILITY

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:10.381
YOU WOULD LOOK AT THE EFFECTS

ANYMORE THOSE CASES AND THERE

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:15.165
ARE CASES OF COURSE NOW THERE'S

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:16.700

LAWS. OF THE STATE AND THEY

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:32.082
HAVE. RAISED THE CAPITAL. AND

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:33.384
THEY'RE UNDERGOING CONSTRUCTION

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.852
RIGHT NOW AFTER GETTING ALL THE

YOU'RE GOING TO POTENTIALLY

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:45.229
UNRAVEL THE IRRESPECTIVE OF

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:46.196
WHETHER THERE'S AN ISSUE OR

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:48.966

SPOKE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE NORMAL

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:54.138
CYCLE PROCESS FOR DEVELOPMENT

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:55.472
REALLY LOOKS AT EXTERNALITIES

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:56.807
ARE PROJECT HOW THE PROJECT

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:59.410
IMPACTS. THE SURROUNDINGS FOR

PUBLIC SCHOOLS ONLY RIGHT NOW

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.079
IT LOOKS ABOUT HOW THE

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:03.314
EXTERNALITY OF OUR IMPACT THE

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.548
SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T EXIST FOR

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:06.183
PRIVATE CHARTERS AT THE MOMENT

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.152
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ALIGN-

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:09.019
AND I OF COURSE UNDERSTAND IT

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:10.521
WOULD- PERHAPS BECAUSE SOME

00:43:10.587 --> 00:43:11.822
DIFFICULTIES BUT I THINK IT'S

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:13.157
AN IMPORTANT STEP TO MAKE SURE

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:15.259
THAT THE STE. THE THAT THE IRA

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:17.094
THE VIRUS SAFE FOR THE STUDENTS

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.462
AND NOT JUST OF THE SCHOOLS AS

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:20.064
SAFE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT ON IN

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.031
AND WHY NOT MAKE THIS

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:21.932
REQUIREMENT FOR ANY

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:24.201
CONSTRUCTION CALIFORNIA THAT

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.403
THAT'S GONE ON NOW OR- IN THE

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:27.805
FUTURE WEARING WHITE WHY

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:29.773
ISOLATING JUST PRIVATE CHARTER

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.374
SCHOOLS HERE AND WHAT YOU'RE

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.276

CONCERNED BUT OUR BILL AS

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:35.479
HOPEFULLY ALIGNING RIGHT NOW

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:36.447
TRYING TO LINE THE SAFETY

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:37.781
STANDARDS OF ALL SCHOOLS OR THE

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:40.050
PRIVATE CHARTER OR PUBLIC SO

THAT OPTION FUTURE THE CENTER.

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:46.590
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT PART OF

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:48.859
THE ISSUE HERE IS- THE ASSETS

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.627
PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NO

00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:52.696
PUBLIC DOLLARS BEING USED.

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:53.797
WHICH WOULD APPLY TO PROJECTS

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:54.898
THROUGHOUT THE STATE YOU'RE

PRIVATE THROUGH AND THROUGH

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:26.630

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:25.349
CONSISTENCY BUT I THINK IF IN

00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:27.284
THE SCOPE OF A BILL IT APPLIES

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:28.085
TO PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION PUBLIC

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:29.953
CONSTRUCTION. OR IN BETWEEN FOR

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.221
CHARTERS SO THAT'S I THINK

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:32.322
WE'LL RECYCLE IT AND WE'RE

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:34.625
MAINTAINING ITS ABOUT SCHOOLS

00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:35.259
RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S THE SCOPE

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:38.328
ARE BILL. OKAY I DO BELIEVE

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:41.064
IT'S- AYE AYES I THINK IT'S

00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:43.333
CONSISTENT WITH ANALOGIC MARBLE.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.968
OKAY I WANT TO SEE- DEVICE

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:47.304
YEARS PASSED THE GAVEL BACK

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:47.771

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.039
QUESTIONS SENATOR DOLLY. THANK

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:52.209

TO SAY SOMEBODY WHO CAME OUT OF

00:46:54.845 --> 00:46:55.379
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SIXTEEN YEARS

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:58.382

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:02.219
SECRET AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:07.224
SECRET. CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST.

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:08.192
WHO WE HAVE THE MOST

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:09.493
REGULATIONS IN TRYING TO PROVE

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.527
A PART PROJECT PROBABLY

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:11.428
ANYWHERE IN THE NATION AND

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.897
THERE MAY BE SOME PLACE THAT

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:14.498
DOES IT MORE BUT I DON'T THINK

00:47:14.565 --> 00:47:16.867
THAT WE- WE'RE BEHIND IN THIS

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:19.903
AREA. THIS BILL APPEARS TO BE

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.939
YOU KNOW PUTTING PRIVATE VERSUS

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.740
PUBLIC IN AND BASICALLY TRYING

00:47:23.807 --> 00:47:24.841
TO GO AFTER CHARTERS WHAT I SEE

00:47:24.908 --> 00:47:26.977
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IF

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:30.581
I'VE AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE.

00:47:30.647 --> 00:47:32.249
I LIKE SEQUEL ACTUALLY SECRET

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:34.051
REGIONAL DESIGNER SEQUEL IS TO

00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:35.319
MITIGATE IMPACTS IF YOU'RE

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:36.186
BUILDING SOMETHING DOESN'T

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.621
MATTER IF YOU'RE PRIVATE OR

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:38.188
PUBLIC YOU STILL HAVE TO GO

00:47:38.255 --> 00:47:39.690
THROUGH THE PROCESS. AT THE

00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:42.459
LOCAL LEVEL. IN THIS BILL IS

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.728
SPLITTING HAIRS AND WE

00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:45.562
OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT IT'S GOING

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:47.931
AFTER. YOU KNOW PRIVATE AND

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:49.700
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THERE SOME

00:47:49.766 --> 00:47:50.567
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THOSE AND

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:52.703
SO. AND WHEN YOU WERE USING THE

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:54.204
ENVIRONMENT AS A TOOL SO FOR ME

00:47:54.271 --> 00:47:56.039
I'M AND I'M NOT SUPPORTING THE

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:57.541
BILL TODAY AND I WILL SHARE

00:47:57.608 --> 00:47:58.709
WITH YOU WE'VE DONE A BUNCH OF

00:47:58.775 --> 00:47:59.843
A SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS IN HERE TO

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:02.879
TRY TO GET THINGS DONE BECAUSE

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:03.380
WE CAN'T BUILD THINGS IN

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:05.115
CALIFORNIA. AND ON TOP OF THAT

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:06.817
THIS BILL IS GOING TO IMPACT

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:08.652
THOSE WHO WENT THROUGH THE PAST

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.087
TO GET SENATORS RECOGNIZED HAVE

00:48:10.153 --> 00:48:11.588
ALREADY. IS WHAT THE PROCESS

00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:13.624
THEY THEY'VE- THEY'VE DONE WHAT

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.892
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. THROUGH

00:48:15.959 --> 00:48:16.627
SEQUEL AND THE LOCAL ORDINANCES

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:18.428
THAT THEY HAVE. AND THIS BILL

00:48:18.495 --> 00:48:19.429
WILL CHANGE THE GAME IN THE

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:20.497
MIDDLE OF THE PROCESS AND I

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:21.632
DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR TO

00:48:21.698 --> 00:48:23.100
THEM. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:25.969
PLENTY OF REGULATORY LAWS- IN

00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:28.038
CALIFORNIA THAT SAFEGUARD. OUR

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.940
STUDENTS AND OUR PRIVATE AND

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:30.941
ARE QUITE FRANKLY OUR

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:33.610
BUSINESSES SO FOR THOSE REASONS

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:34.211
I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:35.812
TODAY. I THANK YOU CENTER I

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:36.780
DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.515
QUESTIONS FROM OTHER MEMBERS. I

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:40.217
DO WHEN I COME BACK AND SOME UP

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:42.219
SOME OF MY COMMENTS THAT. WHICH

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:43.720
IS THAT. I DO THINK THERE'S

00:48:43.787 --> 00:48:44.988
SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:46.256
TYPES OF- MISTAKES THAT HAVE

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:47.724
BEEN MADE AND THE STRATFORD

00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:50.260
SCHOOL AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE.

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:51.228
YOU HAD LOCAL ELECTED

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:53.096
OFFICIALS. THAT WERE HAD THE

00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:54.564
RESPONSIBILITY OF REVIEWING

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.500
THAT PROJECT APPLICATION. AND

00:48:56.566 --> 00:48:58.201
REVIEWING ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:59.069
DOCUMENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:00.871
EVERYTHING WAS. WAS TOGETHER

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:03.106
AND RIGHT AND SAFE AND- AN

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:04.808
APPROPRIATE AND- SO WHEN YOU

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:07.377
HAVE A- AND SO FOR ME THERE'S A

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:08.312
BREAK DOWN THERE. AND THERE

00:49:08.378 --> 00:49:09.813
THERE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.881
FOR THAT THE QUESTION REALLY IS

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:12.382
WHETHER OR NOT. THAT ONE

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:14.251
EXAMPLE IN THE STATE SHOULD BE

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:15.852
USED TO CREATE A BROAD

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:18.588
SWEEPING. OBLIGATION AS

00:49:18.655 --> 00:49:19.589
PROPOSED IN YOUR BILL AND

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:21.291
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:22.759
HAVE HAD I. I THINK THAT IF

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:26.563
YOU- APPLIED IT TOO IF YOU

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.764
DIDN'T HAVE A GRANDFATHER IN

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:30.167
THERE. AND IF YOU- TOOK OUT

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:32.302
PRIVATELY FUNDED PROJECTS WHICH

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:33.904
IN ESSENCE IF YOU DON'T HAVE

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:34.504
PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT COULD BE

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:36.440
ANY PROJECT. BUT IN THIS CASE A

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:39.042
SCHOOL PROJECT I THINK. IT'S A

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.910
PLACE THAT I THINK YOU'D GET MY

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:41.611
SUPPORT. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT

00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:43.013
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS GOOD I

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.681
THINK YOU HAVE THE BEST OF.

00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:47.484
GOALS IN YOUR BILL AND DIED I'D

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:49.353
LIKE TO SEE IT- COME TO

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:50.687
FRUITION AND THAT'S THAT'S THE

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:52.022
CHALLENGE FOR ME AT THIS POINT

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:52.723
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:54.358
PRESENTING ALEX. GIVE YOU THE

00:49:54.424 --> 00:49:56.326
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY ANYTHING

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:56.993
FURTHER INTO CLOTHES IF YOU

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.096
WISH. I'LL CLOSE. OUT I JUST

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.364
WANNA SAY I REALLY THINK

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.531
CENTERS ARE BRING UP THE

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:02.366
CONCERNS ARE VERY VALID

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:03.900
CONCERNS BUT- YOU KNOW

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:06.303
ULTIMATELY. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.671
THESE PROCESSES IN THESE LAWS

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:08.705
RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:09.539
FEELING AS THEIR FAILING OUR

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:11.241
KIDS. AND YOU CAN BET THAT IF

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:12.776
THERE WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL WITH

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:14.077
THE SAME SITUATION THAT

00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:14.945
DESCRIBES GOING DISTRICT

00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:16.680
HAPPENED IT WILL BE UP IN ARMS.

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:18.115
BUT THIS SCHOOL STRAFFORD IS

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:19.549
NOT THE ONLY EXAMPLE THERE'S A

00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:21.518
SCHOOL IN SOUTHEAST L. AID LIKE

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:22.519
I MENTIONED THAT IS ALSO BEING

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:23.987
BUILT ON OR NEAR ARSENIC IS

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:25.922
SMALL. AND IT WAS A GREAT NBC

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:27.090
INVESTIGATIVE PIECE THAT SHOW

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.258
JUST HOW MANY SCHOOLS LIKE TO

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:29.526
ACTUALLY OUT THERE. AND THERE

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:31.461
REALLY WASN'T NOBODY UNTIL.

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:32.429
THAT I KNOW OF UNTIL THIS

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:33.296
INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST PIECE

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:34.664
CAME OUT WHICH IS AFTER THE

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:37.134
STRATFORD CASE THOUGH- THAT

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.802
SHOW THE IMMENSE SCALE THIS

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.036
WHERE THERE COULD BE SO MANY

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:41.705
PUBLIC PRIVATE. AND CHARTER

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:42.706
SCHOOLS THAT COULD BE BUILT

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:44.341
NEAR THIS CONTAMINATION SITES.

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:45.475
AND THE QUESTION IS WITH THIS

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:46.610
BILLS DO WE WANT MORE OF THOSE

00:50:46.676 --> 00:50:48.578
THINGS. IS CLEARLY THE CURRENT

00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:49.980
PROCESSES ARE FAILING US IN A

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:52.082
FAILURE STUDENTS. I DO THINK

00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:53.250
THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOW

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:55.452
HAVE AN- HAVE A- HIGH STANDARD

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:56.653
OF PROOF TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.722
SCHOOLS AND OUR KIDS ARE SAFE.

00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:59.523
I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:02.058
BRING. SCHOOLS OF ANY SORT TO

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:03.693
THAT SAME ALIGNMENT WHETHER THE

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.728
PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHICH I REALLY

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:09.533
THANK THEM FOR SUPPORTING MY.

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:10.033
BILL OR PROP OUR CHARTER

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:10.667
SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE EITHER POP.

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:12.436
FUNDS OR- PRICE. YOU KNOW. I

00:51:12.502 --> 00:51:13.837
THINK WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:14.905
PAGE THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:15.839
OUR STUDENTS FROM THESE AROUND

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:17.174
HAZARDS AND CLEARLY THAT'S WHAT

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.775
I'M SAYING IS THERE'S JUST. A

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:20.177
GAP GAP IN THE HOLDS THAT

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:21.611
EXISTS NOW. CERTAINLY THERE

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:22.712
SHOULD BE MORE. I KIND OF

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:23.847
REALLY LOOKING INTO WHY PASS

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.148
EXAMPLES HAPPENBUT LOOKING

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:26.550
PERSPECTIVE IN THE FUTURE. WE

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:27.818
NEED TO PROTECT OUR KIDS I

00:51:27.884 --> 00:51:28.652
THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:29.920
APPROACH TO PROVE IT. THAT'S

00:51:29.986 --> 00:51:30.687
WHERE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:31.988
PRIVATE SCHOOLS SUPPORTING A

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:33.290
FORTUNE WE HAVEN'T. REACHED
