MY REMARKS WILL BE A LOT SHORTER THAN YOURS HAVE BEEN -- BUT I DO THINK THAT YOU HAVE CAPTURED A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT. THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THEM REFLECTING ON THROUGH THE PROCESS. ANYWAY WE HAVE HELD A NUMBER OF HEARINGS A BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE THAT HAVE OUTLINED IN HIGHLIGHTED. VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THIS A RATHER COMPLICATED AND CHALLENGING PROCESS OF NAVIGATING THROUGH IMPORTANT -- IMPORTANT AREAS THAT -- WHETHER IT BE. PROTECTING THE VICTIMS RATEPAYERS. OUR WEATHER'S LOOKING AT COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY SOLUTIONS. OUR OR CARVING OUT A POLICY. PATHWAY OUT TO PROVIDE STABILITY TO OUR OUR UTILITIES ALL AREAS OF OUR ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND IN OVER MY IN OVER THIRTY YEARS OF PUBLIC POLICY AS A PUBLIC ELECTED OFFICIAL. OF THIS IS BEEN PROBABLY THE MOST CHALLENGING AND MANY TIMES VEXING. AREA OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH. AND THE RAMIFICATIONS AND THE STAKES ARE CLEARLY VERY HIGH -- NO MATTER WHICH WAY WE GO OR HOW WE GO THERE. AND SO WHAT HAS BEEN ON PRESENTED BY THE TIME OUR CULTURE DODD IS A A RECOGNITION OF KEY ELEMENTS. THEY SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THIS REPORT. AND THE KIND OF DIRECTION THAT WE WERE GREEN SHOULD BE PURSUED. OBVIOUSLY AFTER TODAY WE MOVED TO HAVING A REPORT DRAFTED. WHICH WILL GO INTO GREAT DETAIL BEHIND EACH OF THESE ELEMENTS. AND SO MANY OF US EVEN HERE TODAY ARE GOING TO BE -- FOLLOWING THAT PART OF THE PROCESS. AND ENSURING THAT. A KEY. AREAS ARE COVERED -- THAT WE FEEL NEED TO BE COVERED APPROPRIATELY. AND AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMMENTS TODAY -- THIS'S BEEN AS I SAID BEFORE A VERY. IMPORTANT. PUBLIC POLICY FOR US TO ENGAGE JOHN -- BUT IT HAS BEEN VERY VERY CHALLENGING. BECAUSE WE WANT TO AS DO THE RIGHT THING. AND WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WHO'S IMPACTED BY. THESE DECISIONS IN THESE ISSUES ARE. THAT THEIR PERSPECTIVE IS RECOGNIZED [inaudible] AND APPRECIATED. AND SO I THINK THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I APPRECIATE NOT ONLY THE VICE CHAIRS -- LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT ALSO. THE CONFEREES THAT I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY ENGAGE WITH ALL OF THE CONFEREES BUT CERTAINLY IN THE ASSEMBLY. THE CONFEREES OF WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND SO I APPRECIATE. OF THEIR LEADERSHIP THEIR PARTICIPATION -- AND THEIR COMMENTS THAT HAVE HELPED SHAPE WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE'RE NOW GOING TO MEMBERS -- A SILVERSTONE -- YOU HAVE IT A DEADLINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST OR THANK YOU. MISTER CHARITABLE MEMBERS AYE AYES ONE TO SAY THAT -- I'VE REALLY ENJOYED TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU ESPECIALLY THE TWO CO CHAIRS AND I VERY MUCH I SUPPORT THE THE OUTLINE HAS BEEN SO ARTICULATED -- THE ONLY THING THAT I THAT I WOULD LIKE. TO ADD IS THAT -- WHEN WE LOOK AT LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT THAT WE HAVE -- TO ALSO INCLUDE CALTRANS FIRE WAS TO BUY AN AUTOMOBILE THAT WAS RESULT OF CALTRANS NOT MAINTAINING -- LANDSCAPE -- ALSO A PROVISION THAT THE IOC EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND PREVENTING THE EXPENDITURE OF UTILITY REPAIR FUNDS TO PAY FOR ARE YOU EXECUTIV COMPENSATION PERKS I THINK IS -- A GOOD ONE AND AND THEN WENT UNDER JOBS A WORKER PROTECTIONS ON THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSED SO WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF UTILIZING ARE WELL TRAINED PUBLIC FIREFIGHTERS -- IN IN THE EVENT THAT -- WE HAVE WILDFIRES THAT YOU SEE CALIFORNIA THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE CHOSEN. TO TALK TO WORK BECAUSE AS FIRST RESPONDERS AND BACKUP RESPONDERS BUT IN THE EVENT THAT ALL OF OUR PUBLICFIREFIGHTERS ARE BEING UTILIZED IN A MASSIVE FIRE SITUATION -- HOPEFULLY NOTHING LIKE WE SEE IN THIS YEAR THAT DUH. A NON PUBLIC FIREFIGHTERS LOW THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO PARTICIPATE AGAIN PUBLIC FIREFIGHTERS GETTING THE FIRST -- RIGHT TO TO BE THERE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT MULTIPLE WILDFIRES AND HE'S BEEN OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN COVER ALL THE WILDFIRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF IN FACT. THIS IS AN IMPOSSIBLE. THANK YOU FOR ALL ALL THE HARD WORK OF ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'VE. REALLY ENJOYED THIS EXPERIENCE EVER SERVING ON A UTILITY COMMITTEE NEVER SERVING ON INSURANCE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN QUITE A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND I'M HUMBLED BY THE EFFORT -- ON BEHALF OF ALL OF YOU SO. NOBODY WANTS TO GO FIRST. TIMELINE. SENATOR NO PROBLEM UMMC. I I TO AGREE THAT THIS HAS BEEN A VERY COLLABORATIVE EFFORT -- TO BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT IS BECAUSE THIS IS AFFECTING. OF VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY IN THE STATE AND NOT ONLY IS AFFECTING US ALL IN TERMS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY BUT IT'S ALSO AFFECTING OUR ECONOMY -- I JUST NOTED TODAY I THINK IT'S IN TODAY'S LA TIMES THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF LOSS OF TOURISTIC OF FUNDS FOR JUST ONE MONTH WAS AT LEAST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S PROBABLY. MORE THAN THAT PARTICULARLY FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON TOURISM OF FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD SO -- THIS THIS HAS ENORMOUS IMPACT AND I THINK THE CRITICAL THINGS AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE WE SORT OF PIVOTED A LITTLE BIT -- AS WE APPROACH THIS ISSUE FROM OF THE FISCAL HEALTH OF THE UTILITIES TO FOCUS ON WHAT I THINK MOST OF US AGREE IS ORTON CONSIDERATION HERE AND THAT IS PREVENTION AND SAFETY. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT DONE -- WE'VE ALL BEEN FOCUSING ON THAT AS THE FIRST SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH. OF ISSUES OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL A COUPLE THINGS I DID WANT -- TO OBSERVE A I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA -- IS GOING TO BE ENGAGE YOU KNOW WE NEED OUR EXPERTS TO HELP US WITH PREVENTION -- WHILE THE IOUS HAVE A ROLE -- EXCUSE ME THE IOUS BUT OF THE P. YOU SEE HAS A ROLE WE HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY CAPACITY HERE WITH OUR FIRE FIGHTING EXPERTS -- WHO HAVE BECOME MORE EXPERT EVERY DAY WITH EACH ADDITIONAL FIRE AND? I HATE TO CALL IT THE NEW NORMAL BUT CERTAINLY. THE DRAMA OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACT HAS A REALLY FORCED US TO REVIEW AND RECONSIDER HOW WE FIGHT FIRES HOW WE MANAGE AGAINST THEM. AND DIE IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT OUT TO ME THAT -- AS WE A PROCEED WITH OUR FORESTED LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT WHICH WE TALK ABOUT HERE THAT -- THAT IT BE DONE IN AN ECOLOGICALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER AND I THINK THAT WE'VE ALL AGREED ON THAT WE MAY HAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT. OF OPINION WHAT THAT MEANS BUT AGAIN I THINK THE SPIRIT OF OUR DISCUSSIONS HAS BEEN YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE THE CLEAR CUTTING IS NOT THE ANSWER ME NEVER GONNA CUT DOWN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD TREES -- WE DON'T WANNA BLAST ROADS EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY THAT -- WE RESPECT AND APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS A PLACE FOR OUR WILDLIFE -- IN A NEED TO TO HAVE THAT KIND OF ECOLOGICAL BALANCE SO I APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW IS WE GO FORWARD A WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO MAINTAIN THAT BALANCE. AND THE OTHER THING -- THAT I I DID WANT TO ASK BECAUSE I WASN'T CLEAR. IS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN OUR GRID HARDENING. BY -- ARE I'LL USE WILL BE CONSIDERED DURING THE CPUC REASONABLENESS REVIEW. BECAUSE I THINK THAT. I IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS -- BEEN A PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE HARDENING OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE CAR FAR IN SOME OF THESE OTHER FARMERS WERE NOT. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AYE YOU USED WE KNOW THAT THE FIRES UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED TO HAVE. HAD THAT COMPONENTS AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE THOMAS FIRE -- THAT -- WHO WAS SO DEVASTATING AND DESTRUCTIVE FROM MY DISTRICT -- UNDOUBTEDLY HAS THAT COMPONENT AS WELL SO. THIS IS A A A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING FOR A MASSIVE PROBLEM AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ALL I THINK BEEN WORKING TOGETHER WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIRS AND COLLEAGUES FROM A BOTH HOUSES IN BOTH. ASIDE TO THE EYE OF THAT WE ARE. I THINK REALLY ARE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS IS STILL. AND AGAIN I HOPE WE KEEP IN MIND THAT OF WHAT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS NOT NECESSARILY GOOD FOR THE GANDER. AND THAT WE WORK TO TRY TO BEST OF THE FIND THE BEST STUFF -- FOR BOTH IN AND GET A BILL OUT THERE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET% PASSED AND SIGNED THIS YEAR I THINK THAT IS. AN URGENCY THAT WE HAVE IN -- ARE WORKING TOWARDS CHAU AGAIN I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR EFFORTS. PREVENTION AND SAFETY THOSE WHO ARE TRULY THE KEYS. THANK YOU SENATOR SEMI MEMBER GALLON [inaudible] THAT'S THANK YOU CHAIRS FIRST LIE BACK ON THE SENATORS OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT TERM. THIS IS BEEN A OF A LOT OF HEARINGS A LOT OF STUFFS A HAPPEN AND GREAT PEOPLE TO WORK WITH APPEARANCE WHERE WE'RE FACE WAS A BIG CHALLENGE BUT I WANT TO JUST KINDA RE COOP -- WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE? LAST MEETINGS IN WHEREAS SO WE BASICALLY HAVE TAKEN IN VERSE OFF THE TABLE. SO THAT NEEDS TO BE STATED. SO THAT'S OFF THE TABLE. WE'RE LEFT WITH. THE OPTIONS OF IN IN MY MIND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IF WE DO NOTHING. UTILITIES WILL BE DOWNGRADED THE RATEPAYERS WILL PICK UP THAT COST WHEN THEY GO TO THE PC. IF THEY GO INTO BANKRUPTCY THE RATEPAYERS ATTACK OF THE COST OF THE JUDGE WILL BE DECIDING. HOW WE GO FURTHER INTO CHAPTER ELEVEN SO WORTH THE NUMBER THREE OPTION WHICH IS? IN MY MIND WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTORS PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. DOWN TO WHERE THE U. CHARLIE IS STILL [inaudible] SOLVENT. AND CAN STILL BORROW MONEY AT THE RIGHT RATES AND THAT LESSENS THE IMPACT ON THE RATE PAYERS. AND I THINK THE FOURTH ISSUE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT. IS VERY CRITICAL TO THIS. OPTION IS THAT WE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SHAPE THAT WE HAVE FOR VEGETATION AND CALIFORNIA. AS OF THAT AND THAT OPTION ACTUALLY HELPS EVERYBODY IT HELPS THE THAT NINE OTHER FIRES THAT ARE STARTED BY. THE TRANSMISSION LINE. WHICH THAT DRIVES DOWN THE RATES FOR INSURANCE FOR YOUR HOME. IT HELPS FIREFIGHTING COST. IT HELPS THEM. THE RATE PAYERS. ALL THOSE THINGS HELP. EVERYBODY CALIFORNIA NOT JUST THE RATE PAYER OR THE I USE SO I WANT TO SHARE THAT TOWN. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEGGIES FOR THE MOST PART THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEGETATION IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE FORESTED LANDS. WHICH IS A BIG PART OF SENATOR WOOD AND MY EYES DISTRICT AND THEN WE HAVE. THE OAK WOODLANDS I CALLED FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM WHICH IS THAT INTERFACE BETWEEN THE FOREST. AND THE VALLEY'S. WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF GRASS AND BRUSH AND THEN WE HAVE THE COASTAL REGIONS WHICH IS? PRIMARILY AFTER THE NORTH IT'S REDWOODS BUT IF YOU'RE IN THE SOUTH IT CHAPARRAL [inaudible] SO. IN FORESTRY WE HAVE SOME VALUE IN [inaudible] THE PRODUCT THAT COMES OUT THERE WITHIN IT WHEN WE GET TO THE OTHER TWO PIECES OF PIE. LIKE MY GOOD SENATOR HAS THERE IS NO VALUE IN [inaudible] BRUSH. AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FIND. THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PART SO THAT SHE IS ABLE TO USE THAT EQUIPMENT TO KEEP THAT BRUSH DOWN TO A A LEVEL WHERE IT STILL THERE. BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE THERE BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IT HOLDS THE SLOPES IN PLACE. BUT WE ALSO NEED IT DOWN TO THE LEVEL WHERE WE DON'T HAVE IT. AT A FLAME HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET WE NEED THAT FLAME MIGHT AT LESS THAN. TWENTY INCHES. SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA. HOW WE MANAGE THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT TOOLS IN THE IN THE OAK WOODLANDS GRAZING IS A GREAT TOOL AND WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT USING? GRAZING WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT. MASTICATION THERE'S EQUIPMENT THAT KNOCKS THE BRUSH DOWN AND THE FORCED ME TO TALK ABOUT DOING GOOD. SOLID. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FOREST POLICIES AND THAT'S AN AREA THAT I HAPPEN TO BE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON WITH -- OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M GONNA WRAP UP WAS SAYING IS THAT WE MET WE BETTER MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT THE RESOURCES INTO -- OUR BEDS MANAGEMENT PART OF IT OVER SOME TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO CATCH UP WITH THE AMOUNT OF VEGETATION IT'S GROWN OVER THE TIME WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE THOSE -- IOUS SOLVENT SO THAT WE CAN LESSEN THE IMPACT TO ALL THE RATE PAYERS SO THAT'S MY GOAL I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TEMPLATE. TO DO BOTH THE CHAIRS I KNOW THAT THIS IS ON IT'S IT'S HEART WRENCHING TO SEE THE LIVES LOST WE NEED TO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE AND IS NOT GONNA BE EASY THERE ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTS TO RATEPAYERS THERE'S IS NO OTHER WAY AROUND. AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THE THE THE INVESTORS OUR HOW THE HECK A LOT OF SKIN IN THE GAME. AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT GIVING JUNE GIANT BONUSES I'M I'M WITH MY CALLING ON THAT. ONE AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE STILL IN BUSINESS BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM -- THE RATEPAYERS WILL BURKE. HAD THE BRUNT OF THE COST SO AGAIN I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE LANGUAGE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS. I WILL BE MONITORING VERY CLOSELY AND I'M MAKING SURE THAT EVERY I IS. DOTTED AND EVERY TIAS CROSS BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T USE THE TOOLS THAT WERE LAYING OUT ON THE GROUND OUT THERE NOTHING'S GONNA MATTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. SO REMEMBER MAYES. I THINK A SUMMER DEL DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB THERE FLOATING THINGS HAPPEN AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS ABOUT ALSO WANT TO SAY -- THAT I'VE BEEN I'M THANKFUL FOR THE WORK AT THAT THE TWO CO CHAIRS HAVE PUT AND ALL THAT BUT IT INTO THIS -- AND THE AMOUNT OF OF DIALOGUE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TO HAVE IN REGARDS TO THIS -- BETWEEN BRIAN AND I IN THE UP WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY REPUBLICAN CAUCUS -- HE'S WORKED A LOT ON THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT I'M SIDE AND I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE THE THE THE LIABILITY ALTHOUGH THE RECOVER. AND I I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR WHATEVER CONFERENCE REPORT WE PUT TOGETHER THAT WE ADDRESSED SOME OF THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY. WHICH IS THE THE FOREST AND LANDSCAPE ABOUT MANAGEMENT AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S THE DOLLYWOOD -- A PLAN AND I KNOW THAT BOTH OF THEM HAVE BEEN WORKING AN AWFUL LOT. I'M ON THIS AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING A FANTASTIC WORK IN REGARDS -- TO THE FORCED HIM LANDSCAPE UP MANAGEMENT SIDE [inaudible] I THINK. THE CONFERENCE REPORT THAT WE ARE THAT I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SIGN ON TO THE WILL ALSO THOUGH ADDRESS. AT THE QUESTION OF HOW WE DEAL WITH -- WITH COST RECOVERY. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- I USE THAT ARE AMMAN FIRM FINANCIAL -- GROUND A BECAUSE THE DETAILS MATTER AND WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY LANGUAGE IN YET THAT WE'VE SEEN. AND IN REGARDS TO A TO THAT. I JUST LIKE A SOME OF OUR DAILY SAID IT SEEMS VERY CLEAR THAT -- WELL LIABILITY REFORM A DEALING WITH INVERSE CONDEMNATION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT ARE THERE IS OFF THE TABLE ONCE THAT IS OFF THE TABLE ARE ONLY TWO OTHER OPTIONS ARE. EITHER TO DO NOTHING OR TO THING IT COMES DOWN TO THAT QUESTION OF THE SAME QUESTION WE'VE KNOWN NOW 445- MONTHS IS WHO PAYS. AND WHEN DO THEY PAY. AND SO THE DETAILS ARE ARE GOING TO MATTER. THE DIFFERENCE IS WE KNOW BETWEEN THE I USE IN THE PO USES THAT THAT THE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES SOME ARE OWNED BY THE SAME FOLKS THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. AND THE OWNERS OF THOSE MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS ARE THE SAME. IN REGARDS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY THEY ARE DIFFERENT THE SHE THE RATE PAYERS ARE DIFFERENT THEN THE SHAREHOLDERS. AND SO ON WERE THINKING ABOUT THAT LIABILITY THE QUESTION IS IS. WHO PAYS AND WHEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY THERE? WE ALSO NEED TO I BELIEVE SEPARATE. A WHAT'S GOING FORWARD AND WERE TALK ABOUT COST RECOVERY PROVIDING CERTAINTIES ARE GOING FORWARD BUT ALSO REALIZE IT THERE IS GONNA THAT THERE HAS BEEN AND WE DON'T KNOW. EXACTLY YET WHAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LIABILITY IS FOR WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS CERTAINTY. OF FOR P. GENIE AND THAT THERE IS CERTAINTY AS WE GO FORWARD I'M ONE EMPIRE HOPE THAT THAT THE CONFERENCE REPORT AS WE TALK ABOUT COST RECOVERY. WILL DEAL WITH SOME LEVEL OF CERTAINTY AND NOT JUST SOME HOPE SO LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION. SO A MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. YES I WOULD SAY THANK YOU THE CHAIRS AND MY FELLOW CONFEREES IT'S BEEN ON A FASCINATING PROCESS SO FAR -- WITH REGARDS TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US -- COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THAT -- I'D STILL AM LOOKING FOR DETAIL ON FIRST OF ALL THE IN UTILITY PROVIDER PREVENTION OF PLANNING SECTION AS WE LOOK AT THE P. YOU SEE TO OUR OVER. PLANS -- AS PER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- BACK -- AT OUR FIRST HEARING A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I BELIEVE IS MISSING ARE CONCRETE TIME FRAMES. THE LANGUAGE IS A LITTLE TOO LOOSE FROM ME -- STRIVING TO GET SOMEWHERE AND ACTUALLY GETTING SOMEWHERE OR TWO DIFFERENT THINGS WHEN I DON'T WANT TO SEE AS WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THESE PLANTS ARE ASKED WE PUT INTO PLACE AND THEN FOLLOW UP. AND WERE LIKE FIVE YEARS OUT WERE NOT THERE AND I I YOU KNOW MAYBE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY BUT WITHOUT CONCRETE TIME FRAMES. THE CHANCES OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING ARE ARE HIGH IN MY OPINION -- I WANT TO GUARANTEE THAT. AS WE GO FORWARD THAT SHAREHOLDERS PLAY FOR TO PAY FIRST THEY HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME FROM THE BEGINNING. I WANT TO GUARANTEE THAT RATE PAYER DOLLARS ARE USED TO HARDEN THE GRID. ARE USED TO INCREASE SAFETY RELIABILITY AND THAT THERE IS AN AUDIT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS -- I I I I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THAT THAT MONEY BEING SPENT IS ACTUALLY SPENT THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DONE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT CHANGES THE RULES OF FOR THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN FIRES THAT WOULD PUT AN UNDUE BURDEN ON ON RATE PAYERS AND AND AND I'M I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I THINK THESE ARE THINGS I HAVEN'T SEEN CODES IN THE PROPOSAL'S -- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT -- AND I HAVE BEEN. PRETTY OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THIS IS WITH ME FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. GOING BACK TO THE ALLEY รณ REPORT IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR THE RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT WE SPAN ARE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. UP BUT IT TO AT A MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- A THIRD OF OUR STATE IS FORESTED AND AND AS YOU HEARD FROM MISTER DALI -- WE HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER A VARIETY OF LANDSCAPES OUT THERE BUT THIS WILL TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. TO DO THIS JUSTICE IF WE DO NOT COME TOGETHER AS A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE DEALING WITH THE COST RECOVERY DEALING WITH STABILITY. FOR FOR THE UTILITIES AND THE PREVENTION WE'RE DOING A BIG DISSERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN MY OPINION. SO -- THAT BEING SAID I LOOK FORWARD TO OF THE DETAILS IN A LANGUAGE AND WILL BE. LIKE EVERYONE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT EVERY AYE IN EVERY T. AND ALL THE EASE AN IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT SO SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATOR. CENTER CANNELLA. THAT WAS CHAIRMAN IN FIRST OR THINK THE HARD WORK FROM BOTH MORE CHAIRS THAT WE'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH YOU SENATOR DODD APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK. I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING WE HAVE PROPERTY BEING DESTROYED. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FINISH OUR WORK IN AND I'LL SAY. THIS DOESN'T GO AS FAR AS I'D LIKE IT TO GO ON SOME OF THE SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS HOW I WOULD LIKE TO GO A LOT FARTHER BUT THIS IS A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND AND YOU. YOU NEGOTIATE AND AND YOU DON'T GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT SO BUT I AM HAPPY WITH WHERE THIS PACKAGE IS A AND I WANT TO SEE THE WHY BILLY ISSUE HASN'T BEEN A BIG ISSUE FOR ME I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT. IT WAS A BIT OFFENSIVE INITIALLY BE TALKING ABOUT LIABILITY WE HAVE. LIFE AND PROPERTY -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE DYING OF PROBABLY BEING DESTROYED. HOWEVER I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT WHY ABILITY JUST FOR WHAT -- SOBRE DOLLY INNOCENTLY OVER MAYES SAID. AND AND I THINK WE TALK ABOUT LIABILITIES GOING TO BE IN ORDER RIGHT SO NUMBER ONE WE GOT TO COMPENSATE THE VICTIMS THEY'VE GOT TO BE TAKEN CARE OF NUMBER TWO WE GOT PROTECT THE RATEPAYERS REPAIR SHOULD NOT BE ON THE HOOK FOR EVERYTHING. BUT WE CANNOT BANKRUPT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IF WE DO WE WILL SEE MASSIVE INCREASES. TO ALL OF OUR UTILITY BILLS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING POWER AND SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT. SO I THINK THE SECURITIZATION AS IMPORTANT I THINK A STRESS TEST WHERE WE WE GET AS MUCH OUT OF THE UTILITIES AS WE CAN AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE A UTILITIES THAT CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE SO. I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING OBVIOUSLY WE GOT A LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND WE HOPEFULLY WE COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THAT. AND WE NEED TO DO A PRETTY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO. I THINK WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND I WOULD LIKE TO FINISH THIS IN AND REALLY THE ULTIMATE GOAL. IS LET'S DEAL WITH THE FORCE MANAGEMENT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FIRES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SO. I LIKE WE'RE GOING I DO A CENTER GAINES WHO OBVIOUSLY IS HAS HAD AREAS OF HIS DISTRICT BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE'S HAVE FIRES HE HE WANTS TO ADD -- THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER -- A BLANK WHICH TO DISSUADE LOOTERS BY PROVIDING THE CASES OF GRAND THEFT LOOTING AND LOOKING OF A FIREARM WOULD BE CONSIDERED A FELONY -- PER HIM THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHERS THEN INCREASE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS A NUMBER OF SUSPECTS ARRESTED FOR LOOTING -- EXCAVATED HOMES DURING CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. STEALING FROM VICTIMS WHATEVER A PRECIOUS BELONGINGS AND LEFT IN THEIR HOMES IS REPREHENSIBLE SO. THAT HASN'T BEEN SO WE TALK ABOUT BUT I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO RUN AT A TIME I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH TIME FOR HIM. TO TO GET A BILL GOING OVER I'M -- AMID A BILL SO MAYBE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT WE DO LANGUAGE SO THANK YOU. IF YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS. THANK YOU AND I TOO WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY CO CONFEREES AND THANK THE CHAIRS -- IT'S BEEN AN HONOR WORKING WITH BOTH OF YOU. THE AMOUNT OF WORK YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS HAS BEEN AMAZING AND I THANK YOU AND YOUR RESPECTIVE STAFFS. I THINK WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THAT WHAT WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF FIRST IS THE VICTIMS. THAT HAS TO BE FIRST. YEAH MAKING THEM WHOLE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DO MAKE THEM WHOLE. A SECOND AND I DO APPRECIATE THE EXPERT TEAMS. HERE AT THIS THAT AND THE DICE WITH THE WITH THE WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS ON PREVENTION TO FUTURE FIRES [inaudible] AND SAFETY. OF THE THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER ABOUT. HOW YOU MEASURE A TREE AND HOW MANY TREES YEAH I ME THAT THIS IS BEEN AMAZING? AND I APPRECIATE THE EXPERTISE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THAT REGARD. THE OTHER THING THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME HAS BEEN AT THE VERY TOP. IS MAKING SURE THAT WE PROTECT SOLVENCY. OF THE RATE PAYERS. THE RATE PAYERS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE NUMBER ONE ON MY LIST. I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT THE ONES THAT SUFFER BECAUSE OF MISMANAGEMENT THAT THEY ARE NOT THE ONES THAT SUFFER BECAUSE SOMEONE CHOSE TO DO. BUT HAD A DIFFERENT PRIORITY THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD. THE RATE PAYERS MUST BE PROTECTED IN ALL OF THIS. I DO APPRECIATE TO THE LANGUAGE REGARDING WORKER PROTECTION -- IS IN A FORM OF GRANDFATHERING OUR WORKERS WHO ARE ALSO NOT AT FAULT IN THIS. WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS IS SPIN COMPLICATED [inaudible] CHALLENGING. BUT I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. OF THE CONFEREES -- HERE PRESENT. THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND ABOUT THE GENUINE CONCERN OF EVERYONE HERE. IN TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION. THAT WILL WORK. ONE VERY SPECIFIC AREA HAS TO DO WITH BIOMASS -- IT'S AN AREA THAT IN THE PAST I'VE SAID THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN AGREE TO BY A MOUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE IT'S TOO DIRTY. AND I'VE. LEARNED FROM THIS CONFERENCE THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ON THE TABLE. BUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT THE SAME. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND BILE MOUSE IN OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT DIFFERENTLY. BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE. I THE REST OF OUR COMMENTS AS HAS BEEN SAID BY THE REST OF MY COLLEAGUES. THE BEST A THE COMMENTS WILL BE LEFT UNTIL WE SEE THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE. BECAUSE WE WILL BE CHECKING THAT LANGUAGE. AND THE EXPERTISE HERE. I IS GOING TO HELP US PUT TOGETHER THE BEST CONFERENCE REPORT. POSSIBLE SO I DO THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT YOU SEVENTY MEMBER A SENATOR HUESO. I SEE A LOT OF THE SAME FACES AND THE AND THE CROWD THAT WERE -- THEY'VE BEEN THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND I APPRECIATE GETTING ALL THE INPUT. FROM FROM THE PEOPLE THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES ARE. I I'M VERY. I'M A VERY SATISFIED THAT I THINK WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES THAT REQUIRE ACTION AT THIS MOMENT -- WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED I THINK HAS BEEN -- THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED AND AS FAR AS WHAT'S IN THIS CURRENT. OUTLINED AYE SUPPORT WHAT'S IN THE OUTLINE I THINK IT GETS TO THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES OF OF THE MOMENT. NOW CAN WE DO OTHER THINGS -- YES BUT AT THAT MEAN ARE THEY AS URGENT AS THESE PROBABLY NOT AS URGENT. SO I WANT TO JUST ALSO. THANK THE MEMBERS WHO HAVE SPOKEN ON BEHALF OF THE RATEPAYERS SAY. THANK YOU FOR EXPRESSING YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE REPAIRS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT NECESSARILY WILL WILL SEND RATES SKYROCKETING THAT'S THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. A I THINK IT'S AN A AN IMPORTANT ISSUE STATEWIDE IT'S OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO MY DISTRICTS I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT. I ALSO WANT -- TO REITERATE THAT A LOT OF THE STUFF HAS BEEN DONE. IN IN IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE ALREADY HAS SHOWN. ENORMOUS -- BENEFITS IN REDUCING THE FUEL. THAT CAUSES THE FOR THESE FIRES AND HAS INCREASED RESPONSIVENESS. TO ANY -- ANY FIRE INCIDENT. AND MAKING SURE THAT IT DOESN'T SPREAD IT BECAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE. AND WE'VE ALREADY SHOWN THAT THAT CAN BE DONE AT SAN DIEGO I THINK THESE ADDITIONAL POLICIES WILL HELP -- IN IN -- IN ADDRESSING THAT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE WE MAY HAVE IN SAN DIEGO SO THIS IS. I AN ADDITIONAL FILTER THAT WILL HELP HELP TO PROVIDE -- MORE PREPAREDNESS -- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THOSE MAPS AND LOOK AT WHAT WHAT ARE THE MOST AT RISK AREAS IN THE STATE THERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE I KNOW. THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE IS IS HAVING THESE MASSIVE FIRES THAT ARE JUST [inaudible] A DOING INCREDIBLE DAMAGE -- ALL THE RICH I MEAN IF READ DENOTES. THE THE THE HIGHEST. A LOT -- POTENTIAL FOR FIRE. THE RED IS ZONES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE SOUTH. SO WE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THE SOUTH. TO PREVENT THESE FIRES AND WHATEVER WE HAVE A FOUR INCH LEFT. DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. TO PROTECT US FOREST'S. AND AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE INDIAN THE FOUR IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN KEEP. THE FORCE OF LIFE. AND THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY -- SOMETHING THAT -- WAS HOTLY DEBATED IN THE PAST AND NOW IT'S BECOMING VERY CLEAR. THAT'S THINNING THE FOREST IS GOOD FOR THE FORCES GOOD FOR THE LONGEVITY OF THE FOREST. AND IT'S IT'S GOOD TO HELP GROW. THE FOOTPRINT OF THE FOREST. AND THOSE THINGS ARE ARE ADDED INTO THIS PLAN WHICH I THINK ARE GOING TO HELP. IN MAKE SURE THAT OUR FORESTS CONTINUE TO IT NOT ONLY EXISTS AND PROVIDE [inaudible] THE THE THE THE GOOD WORK OF REMOVING -- GHGS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AND AND WHAT THE FUNCTIONING AS THAT LONG. THAT ARE CREATING CLEANER FOR OUR STATE [inaudible] AND YOU KNOW THE I ALWAYS SAID THAT THE THE BIGGEST PART OF THIS BILL SHOULD BE PREVENTIVE PREVENTIVE MEASURES PREVENTION. AND AND RESPONSE. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO EVENTS AND I THINK THAT -- THIS THIS. OF WHAT'S IN THIS OUTLINE YOU THINK WILL DO THE THE FURTHEST IN ASSURING THAT WERE. WERE AT A BETTER PLACE AFTER WILL. WE WE IT PASS A MEASURE THAT INCLUDES. A VERY -- A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THAT STATE LEVEL TO MAKE SURE WE CAN BE MORE RESPONSIVE SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. FOR YOUR HARD WORK.

UNFORTUNATELY. I HAVE. TO INFORM THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE SEVERAL COMPONENTS WITHIN THE PROPOSED PACKAGE TO HAVE US GRAVELY CONCERNED [inaudible] TO SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON SAYS COMMENTS. SO REMEMBER WOULD AND DOLLY AND SEVERAL OTHERS. TO PAY WHAT THE LANGUAGE LOOKS LIKE BUT WHAT WE FEAR THE LANGUAGE LOOKALIKES RELATIVE TO THE FIRE PLANES -- THE GOVERNOR'S LANGUAGES PROPOSED. DOESN'T DO ANYTHING [inaudible] ON HARDENING. IT IS SIMPLY A REARRANGING OF THE DECK CHAIRS. IT'S A RESTATEMENT OF EXISTING LAW. AS IT WAS PRESENTED WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD FORCED UTILITIES FOR THE P. YOU SEE TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY. IN REGARD TO HARDEN THE SYSTEM. IF THE LANGUAGE REFLECTS WHAT WE FEAR IT WILL REFLECT. WE WE'LL BE OPPOSED TO A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE REPORT. IT WILL BE INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST.

MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS ONE STOP I WILL CLOSE THIS OUT THIS IS TO KEEP POINT. IT SHOULD BE ON THE RECORD. WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THAT POINT IS ALL OF THE POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS THE PGD HAS HAVE CASH CALLS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM WHEN THEY GET DOWNGRADED TO THE LEVEL BEING NOT CREDITWORTHY ANY LONGER? THEY HAVE TO PONY UP ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH THAT'S BECAUSE IT ILLIQUIDITY ISSUE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. AND PUT PRESSURE TOWARDS BANKRUPTCY BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT. OUT OF THE SIX BILLION DOLLARS IT TAKES TO RUN PGD ANNUALLY. THEY NEED TO BILLION DOLLARS FROM. THE MARKET WHICH WILL NOW NOT BE AVAILABLE.

JEANNIE UTILITIES OR ANY OF THE OTHER INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE STATE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL STILL CONTAINS VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS FOR SOME OF OUR AGRICULTURAL RATEPAYERS. IN ADDITION WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT COMPONENTS THAT SEEM TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS HOWEVER. THE PIECE RELATIVE TO THE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS IS SOMETHING THAT OUR INDUSTRY IS GENERALLY OPPOSED -- TO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON POTENTIALLY DRAFTING CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THAT LANGUAGE ON PER USUAL WERE HAPPY TO BE.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE TO COME BEHALF OF AMERICAN TO STASH YOUR GROWERS CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL CALIFORNIA CONGENERS AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION YOU SEE FARMERS WEAKENED WESTERN ON PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION -- WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AT THE FOREST MANAGEMENT PERSON IS IN THERE WE STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS. TWO THINGS HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT THROUGHOUT A LOT OF THESE AND COMMITTEE HEARINGS ONE IS THAT. YOU WOULD NOT BE LOOKING RETROACTIVE AND TWO IS THAT PROTECT THERE WOULD BE PROTECTION OF REPAIRS. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE JUST NOT SEEING THAT IN THIS PLAN. I'M UTILITY FIRE PREVENTION IN PLANNING RATEPAYERS ARE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR THAT -- I OWE YOU A GREAT PAIR PROTECTION BONDS ALSO KNOWN AS SECURITIZATION RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THAT -- CP YOU SEE REASONABLENESS REVIEW AND THAT ACTUALLY CHEFS LIABILITY PROTECTION MORE TOWARDS THE UTILITIES AND COSTS TOWARDS THE RATE PAYERS SO AGAIN. RATEPAYERS WILL BE PAYING FOR THAT AND WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK ABOUT WELL WE NEED THESE FACTORS IT ACTUALLY SAYS FACTORS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE AYE YOU WILL RATE PEERS HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THIS EITHER. WE DON'T MAKE THE PLANS WE DON'T MANAGE THE SYSTEM SO WE REALLY DON'T HAVE CONTROL. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE LANGUAGE BUT WE ARE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THIS TURNING INTO SOME SORT OF BAIL OUT THANK YOU. YOU [inaudible] SPEAKER AT I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. I THINK I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF COLLEAGUES HAVE COME RIGHT BEFORE -- FROM AG INDUSTRY SIDE OF THINGS THAT THIS -- LOOKS LIKE A BAILOUT SMELLS LIKE A BAILOUT IN. CERTAINLY FEELS LIKE A BAILOUT -- AS IS MENTIONED THERE SEEM TO BE A LOT OF ADDITIONAL. THE RATE PAYER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND I THINK ONE THING THAT I'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- PREVIOUSLY DURING YOUR COMMENTS WAS A CONCERN ABOUT SHAREHOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDERS BEING FIRST TO PAY. WE DON'T SEE THAT HERE IN THIS OUTLINE AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD A DESCRIPTION OF A SCENARIO IN WHICH SHAREHOLDERS ARE GOING TO BE. FIRST AT THE TABLE IN PAYING THIS AND THAT WAS ONE OF OUR PRIMARY AND IN MAJOR CONCERNS PREVIOUSLY. THAT WAS EXPRESSED ALL OF YOU BOTH IN TESTIMONY AND MEETINGS WAS THAT SHAREHOLDERS HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME. AND WE STILL DON'T SEE THAT HERE AND I REALIZE THAT THIS IS BEEN CELLS ARE WILL TIMES THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ON THE LANGUAGE. BUT GIVEN THE CONCERNS A REPAIR GROUPS HAVE EXPRESSED YOU MULTIPLE TIMES WE WOULD HAVE HOPE TO SEE IN THIS OUTLINE. SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO THAT POINT HERE AND I THINK IT'S MISTER DALI IN MISTER WOULD BOTH EXPRESSED PREVIOUSLY. THEY'LL THIS SPECIFIC POINT THAT SHAREHOLDERS PAY FIRST AND WOOD TO THAT POINT WERE DISAPPOINTED I THINK IN THIS. YOU KNOW OUTLINED HAS BEEN LAID OUT THIS MORNING THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT WE HEAR IT. BUT WE DON'T SEE IT AND THAT'S OF CONCERN THREE PAIR HAVE. WE WANT TO AVOID A BAIL OUT THE UTILITIES WE UNDERSTAND THE RATEPAYERS ARE GOING TO CARRY SOME OF THE BURDEN. THAT IN THIS SCENARIO IT APPEARS TO BE. ALL OR AT LEAST BY AND LARGE MOST OF THE COSTS ARE GOING TO FALL ON REPAIRS AND GIVEN THAT WE ARE ALREADY. NEARLY 1100%. ABOVE THE HOUSE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR ELECTRICITY RATES. ON THE INDUSTRIAL SIDE. WE JUST CAN'T BEAR ANYMORE IT THIS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN THIS STATE TO CREATE JOBS. THAT PROVIDE FOR OUR FAMILIES AND HELP BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A VIABLE UTILITY BUT IF IT COMES AT THE RATE PAYERS EXPENSE. WHAT WHAT HAVE WE GAINED? MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MICHAEL VOCAL OR ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT A HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. BUT I DO SHARE SOME OF THE FRUSTRATIONS OF THE OTHER RATE PAYER ADVOCATES THAT HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD TODAY. I'M GONNA FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT MISTER WOOD BROUGHT UP AND THAT IS. IN ALL THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PROSPECT OF CHANGES TO THE LIABILITY CHANGES AND THE COST RECOVERY CHANGES. WE'RE NOW SUDDENLY TALKING ABOUT RETROACTIVE CHANGES TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WHAT WE WERE TOLD IN THE BRIEFING LAST NIGHT. EVEN PRIOR TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS COULD GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BUTTE FIRE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND OTHERS THAT HAVEN'T COME BEFORE THE COMMISSION. AND THAT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY. CONCERNING TO US. I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE OTHER POINT THAT WE HEARD CONSISTENTLY. AND THAT IS THAT THE UTILITIES PGA IN PARTICULAR WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE WHEN THEY'RE NEGLIGENT OR OR THEY FAILED TO DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO OTHER IMPRUDENT OR THEY'RE AT FAULT. THAT TOO HAS CHANGED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL OR IS ABOUT TO CHANGE INTO THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ONLY LOOKING IT NEGLIGENCE AND FAULT. YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THESE OTHER FACTORS. SO THAT IS A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. AND WE BELIEVE I'M I'M GONNA INVOKE MY WATCH RIGHT AS A RAIL VERIFY COULD THANK YOU -- I JUST LOVE O. O. CONCLUDED HERE. AND HELP BOTH OF THESE CHANGES HAVE A VERY VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT -- THAT IS YOU KNOW AMOUNTS TO A MASSIVE BAILOUT PGM A AT RATE PAIR EXPENSE AND I KNOW THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING FOR HERE BUT THAT'S WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO AT LEAST TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSACE HUES OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS REPRESENTING THE FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA I JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE RIGHT PAIR ADVOCACY. GROUP AND JUST KIND OF UNDERSCORED THE IMPACT THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ON THE FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY AT THIS FALLS ON RATE PAYERS WE PROVIDE GOOD JOBS UP AND DOWN. OF THE STATE PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE A LOT OF OUR PLANTS ARE. UP ENERGY COSTS ARE. OUR LARGEST COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN IF WE PUT ALL OF THE WILDFIRE A LIABILITY ISSUES. ARE SEIZING THE COSTS ON THE RATE PAYERS THIS OFTEN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

NOT ONLY COMPANIES LIKE MYSELF WHICH HAVE CONTRACTS WITH THE UTILITIES AND ARE THOUSANDS OF WORKERS.

GETTING A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN OR ANY ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND THEN A DISCUSS SMALL LANDOWNERS EXEMPTION. I THINK YOU KNOW PEOPLE OF THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEES OPEN TO THAT DISCUSSION THE CURRENT LIMIT IS AT TWENTY SIX INCHES YOU CANNOT HARVEST TO TREAT GREATER THAN TWENTY SIX INCHES OTHERWISE YOU HAVE. TO DO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. PEOPLE REFERENCE THIRTY SIX INCHES THAT'S OBVIOUSLY AN ENORMOUS TREE AND THAT IS A NON STARTER THIRTY INCHES WITH SOMETHING THAT THE THAT THE THAT THE FORESTRY INDUSTRY THEMSELVES HAS SAID.

THE OUTSIDE WE SUPPORT INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN FIRE PREVENTION AND CARBON REDUCTION ACTIVITIES AND MAKING THOSE SUSTAINED AS OPPOSED TO ONE TIME COMMITMENTS. I WAS SUPPORT IN PRINCIPLE THE CONCEPT OF REPAIR PROTECTION BONDS TO PROVIDE URGENTLY NEEDED RELIEF TO WHILE FIRE VICTIMS WELL TO STABILIZING THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR ELECTRIC UTILITIES. ITALY'S FINANCING COSTS CONTINUE TO ESCALATE CUSTOMERS WILL PAY FOR IT HIGHER BILLS AND WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT UTILITY BANKRUPTCIES ANYA LOTS OF STATE CONTROL OVER CRITICAL PART OF A CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU. BEFORE THE NEXT WEEK HER WHICH ONE MAKE IT CLEAR THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THREE DIAMETER THE THING [inaudible] NOT [inaudible] GO AHEAD. I WILL ASSURE YOU I'M NOT PROPOSING THIRTY SIX INCHES THAT CAME FROM STE I DON'T KNOW WHERE BUT WORK THAT'S NOT PART OF THE DOLLYWOOD PROCESS [inaudible] THERE. DAVID KITANA WITH UP FROM THE ASHES REPRESENTING WILD FOR VICTIMS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- BY REMOVING INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND SPEEDING UP VICTIM RECOVERY WE THANK YOU FOR COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT THE VICTIMS CAN CAN SUPPORT [inaudible] IF YOU. I GOOD AFTERNOON KELLY BOYD WITH THAT CALIFORNIA LOW CARBON FUEL AND ENERGY COALITION -- BY ONE FOR STRICT MECHANICS TO SENATOR JACKSON WHO WAS HERE IN THE SAME ROOM ALMOST EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO DEALING WITH THE A SIMILAR -- FINANCIAL SITUATION IMPENDING BANKRUPTCY FOR VERY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE LESS ABOUT THINGS OUT OF CONTROL AND AND I THINK THERE'S A MUCH BRIGHTER LINE NOW. ON WHAT UTILITIES CAN AND CAN'T CONTROL THEIR SOLVENCY -- IS IMPORTANT TO THE STATE'S A IT'S THAT OUR COUNTERPARTIES TO THEIR CONTRACTS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS TO THE SECURITY OF THE STATE I THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO IT I I TUST ALL OF YOU TO DO THAT -- I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS A ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES WHO S. SAID BIOMASS NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION BIO ENERGY IS KEY -- AND AS YOU KNOW FROM -- LANGUAGE FOLKS HAVE SEEN AB EIGHT NINETY THREE THEY WANT TO BE THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION AND THE MOST EFFICIENT THEY WANT TO DO THIS IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO ADDRESS THE EMERGENCY. WE THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THAT THANK YOU. KISSIN THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME HOW OLD I THINK YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON IGNACIO HERNANDEZ IN BEHALF OF TURNED UTILITY REFORM NETWORK RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYERS. OTHER NUMBER OF DETAILS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO REVIEWING -- BUT THE LANGUAGE COMES OUT AND ME JUST MENTION A COUPLE KEY POINTS. FOR US AYE NUMBER ONE AND I THINK. AT LEAST SOMEWHAT -- THE OUTLINE DOES CREATE KIND OF AIR TYPE PROTECTION. FOR RATEPAYERS IN THE EVENT THAT -- UTILITIES FOUND TO BE IMPRUDENT -- AND THAT'S REALLY REALLY KEY FOR US IT HAS TO BE AIRTIGHT. I UNDERSTAND THAT MIGHT BE BE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR THE UTILITIES BUT IF THEY'VE ACTED IMPRUDENTLY. THEN IT SHOULD STILL REMAIN WITH UTILITIES -- ON THE ISSUE OF THE RATE PAYER -- BONDS -- PROTECTION BONDS WHAT'S GOING TO BE KEY FOR US IS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT. THOSE BONDS OR AN OPTION PROVIDED TO THIS DEEP YOU SEE OR IS IT THE ONLY OPTION AND THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON -- THE COMMISSION WILL DETERMINE IMPRUDENT SEE WHETHER SOMEONE ACTED PRUDENTLY ARE NOT. THEN THEY WILL SAY OKAY FOR THE NON NEGLIGENT LIABILITY. THESE BONDS WILL BE USED THAT MEANS ON 101100%. OF THE NON NEGLIGENT LIABILITY WILL GO TO RATEPAYERS YES IT'S FINANCED YES IT MAY BE LOWERED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. BUT IF IT'S THE ONLY OPTION FOR THE COMMISSION THEN IT'S THE RATEPAYERS WILL PAY TO US WE THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC IN THE SAME WAY THAT UTILITIES. WILL ARGUE THEY SHOULDN'T PAY. FOR LIABILITY DOT THEY WERE NOT NEGLIGENT. FOR RATEPAYERS TO SAY WELL. WE PAID FOR ALL OF PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND WHY IS IT THE UTILITY GETS THE LEGAL BENEFIT OF IT AND WE DON'T SO. THE BONDS COULD BE ONE OPTION SHOULDN'T BE THE ONLY OPTION THERE SHOULD BE OTHER WAYS TO MAYBE SOCIALIZING. MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE FUNDS MAYBE SHOULD BE OTHER WAYS IT SHOULD JUST BE. ONE OF THE COMMISSION CAN A PORTION THE NON NEGLIGENT LIABILITY NOW. I'M IT'S SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN OFF THE TABLE JUST TWO VERY QUICK THINGS. BOB ONE IS WE DO APPRECIATE -- COMMENTS BY A NUMBER OF YOU ABOUT RAPE PAIR PROTECTION AND IN PARTICULAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIND OF THE POTENTIAL STRESS TESTS [inaudible] FOR UTILITIES. WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT IS THERE A LIMIT OR A LINE THAT WE SHOULDN'T CROSS FOR RATEPAYERS -- SO IF WE ARE GONNA ASK REPAIRS TO PAY SOME PORTION OF THIS. WHERE'S THE STRESS TEST OR WHERE'S THE ALICE IS TO SAY OKAY THAT'S LITTLE TOO MUCH I REMEMBER RATEPAYERS OUR PAIN FOR PREVENTION ACTIVITIES NOW. WILL BE PAYING FOR THE ADDITIONAL -- ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE LANGUAGE AND OTHER THINGS OUTSIDE SO IT'S REALLY REALLY KEY TO JUST REALIZE. THE RATEPAYERS CANNOT BE INSURERS OF LAST RESORT QUE THERE AND HAS TO BE SPREAD AROUND WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT -- THE LAST THING IS WILL BE LOOKING OBVIOUSLY THE KEY FACTORS -- THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE THE PRUDENCE REVIEW AND AGAIN WE WANT HI -- AND NOT PUSHING IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SETS CAN REALLY CAN BE KEY I THINK ALL THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COMMUTING STAFF FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE SOME REAL CHALLENGE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO GIVING EVEN FURTHER AYE RESPONSE WHEN WE SEE THE DETAILS THANK -- JR MEMBERS HAS CERTAINLY HAS ONLY HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL VERY STRONG SUPPORT -- YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OUR REASONS FOR SUPPORTING THIS AND THAT IS. SECURITIZED THING IN MAKING SURE THE TWO LADIES ARE FINANCIALLY VIABLE I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THAT THESE PROJECTS THAT THEY PROCURED. WERE SOME OF THE MOST BORN PROJECTS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION ONE ON MEMBERS WERE EXPERIENCING 50% UNEMPLOYMENT. IT WAS POLICY POLICIES SUCH AS THE RP ASKED THAT UTILITIES ARE CENTRAL WITH THAT ALLOWED FOR OUR MEMBERS TO CONTINUE PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WE KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE WE THANK YOU AND THE STAFF OF WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO MAKE SURE. THAT UTILITIES REMAIN SAFE AND VIOLENT THAT FIRST.

THE MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION EIGHT OF LEAD TO PANDER AND DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT MAKE THE GRID. AND TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. MORE CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE. UTILITY FINANCIAL INSTABILITY WOULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS. AND THE STATE AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION THAT WILL BE NEEDED. TO MEET THE STATE'S GOALS. IT IS VITAL THAT UTILITIES HAVE A FINANCIALLY VIABLE FUTURE. AND WE HOPE THIS DISCUSSION WILL LEAD TO A WORKABLE SOLUTION. WE THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND EFFORT YOU PUT INTO IT.

AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE. I'VE HAVEN'T HEARD AND WE ARE GONNA BE. CLEARLY WATCHING IS ON THE SECURITIZATION AND THE NEW STANDARD FOR WEATHER TOOK THE COSTA REASONABLE ON THE SIT ON THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. WHERE THERE WERE YOU DETERMINED THAT THE? CPU OR THAT THE UTILITIES ARE NOT NEXT. WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT REPAIRS ARE NOT? THE BLANK CHECK THEY ARE NOT THE BAILOUT.

GOOD AFTERNOON WAS TURNED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OUTSIDE OF ON THE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RELEASE -- FIRST AUTHORED BY ALIGNING MY COMMENTS WITH -- OTHER CONSERVATION GROUPS A SPOKESMAN FOR ME -- AN RTC DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE ON CALIFORNIA AND PACIFIC FORCE TRUSTS. WHILE YOU'RE I THINK THE OUTLINE ALSO REFERENCES OTHER PENDING LEGISLATION WERE IN WHICH THE DAY AT DIAMETER QUESTION IS BEING CONSIDERED SO I DO THINK IT IS RELEVANT TO THIS DISCUSSION -- BUT BEYOND THAT CALIFORNIA RELIEF -- WORKS ON URBAN FORESTRY ISSUES -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SPECIFICALLY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN CENTRAL VALLEY -- FROM STOCKTON DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE A CONCERN WITH IT IS THAT THESE ARE ALL A LOT OF THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HIT FIRST AND WORST BY A LOT OF THE THE SMOKE PLUMES IN PARTICULAR MATTER IMPACTS IN THE VALLEY GIVEN -- WHENEVER OUR FORCED OPEN FLAMES -- JUST GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE GEOLOGY OF CENTRAL VALLEY -- AND THE INABILITY FOR AIR TO TO PUSH THAT THE BAD AYE AIR OUT OF THE OUT OF THE VALLEY -- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S A CONCERN GROWING CONCERN FOR US IS -- RELATIVES OF THE BIOMASS FACILITIES WHICH ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN -- PARTICULATE MATTER AND AND POLLUTION IMPACTS -- I WOULDN'T BE BRIEF -- DIDN'T AND FOR US WE WE WOULDN'T REALLY APPRECIATE SAYING BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL AND TECHNOLOGY PARAMETERS BEING CROWNED THESE -- EXTENSIONS OF THE CONTRACTS ARE VIOLENCE MASS BASILIDES -- WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE -- THAT BEING IN THE FINAL VERSION OF THE COMMITTEE REPORT AND AND LOOK FORWARD. TO THE CONTINUE CONVERSATION THANK YOU SPEAKER. THANK YOU CO CHAIRING MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERSON IN YONKERS NO DOOR PRIZE FOR THE LAST SPEAKER. OTHERS IF I MORE PEOPLE COMING NEXT DON'T WORRY -- FIRST MIANI FOR CALIFORNIA LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS AND PART OF THE RATE PAYER COALITION I THINK YOU'VE HEARD. LOUD AND CLEAR A LOT OF THOSE CONCERNS AND AND I THINK WE APPRECIATED THE COMMENTS FROM THE DYESS YET WERE A BIT SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED THAT. THOSE RATE PAYER ACT CONCERNS THAT WERE VOICED WHAT PART OF THE DOCUMENT. AND YOU KNOW BY WAY OF EXAMPLE IN IN IN SOME OF THE ISSUES THE SECURITIZATION FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T REALLY SHOW. THAT THE INVESTORS ARE GOING TO BE PAID FIRST AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE. YOU KNOW HIGHLIGHTED AS AS WE GO FORWARD -- IN THE DETAILS OF THIS WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE STOCK PRICE BEING DRIVEN DOWN AND IN CONCERN OVER EXISTING CONTRACTS THE LAST TIME THE STATE HAD. A MAJOR ENERGY CRISIS ALL OF THOSE CONTRACTS WERE ULTIMATELY HONORED AND THEY THEY DIDN'T FAIL SO I I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S IT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING SHOULD BE THE FRONT OF THIS LIST -- AND LASTLY WE'VE PUT TOGETHER SEVERAL PROPOSALS A OF THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE ULTIMATELY REASONABLE JUST AND REASONABLE TO USE THE LANGUAGE. PARLANCE OF THE OF ENERGY POLICY IN CALIFORNIA AND WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN HEARD UP TO THIS POINT. AS YOU MOVE FOR THE DETAILS THE DETAILS MATTER. I BELIEVE I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE IN THE RATE PARA COALITION THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO BE A RESOURCE -- FOR YOU IF YOU WILL FOR IN THAT LANGUAGE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU WANT ANY OR ALL OF US TO BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION IN DETAIL. I I THINK WE WOULD ALL BE HAPPY TO BE HERE OVER THE WEEKEND IF YOU NEED US THANK YOU. OKAY THAT -- LOOKS LIKE THAT CONCLUDES PUBLIC COMMENT I DID -- IT RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES. I THINK YOU CHAIR AND YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS MAYBE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN MY COMMENTS BEFORE -- FROM SOME OF MY GOOD FRIENDS AT THAT WERE USING THE TERM BAILOUT FROM WHAT'S IN FRONT. I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE PERSON -- OF THIS CONFERENCE A COMMITTEE IN FACT I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE MEMBER THE LEGISLATURE WHO HAS EVER SUGGESTED THAT WE WANT TO BAIL OUT ANYONE -- WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO PUT TOGETHER A PROPOSAL? THAT MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A I'LL USE THAT I'M ARE GONNA GO A BELLY UP. AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS AT THE SAME TIME. IT'S IT ONCE WE TOOK LIABILITY REFORM OFF THE TABLE WHICH MANY OF YOU WHO STE CAME TO SPEAK AT TODAY TALKING ABOUT RATE PAYERS. YOU THE SAME ONCE COMING TO TAPPED TO US SAYING PLEASE I'D YOU KNOW PLEASE DON'T HURT PLEASE TAKE INVERSE CONDEMNATION OFF. OFF THE TABLE SOON AS YOU DO THAT SOMEBODY'S GONNA END UP HAVING TO PAY THERE IS VERY FEW OF YOU THAT WERE LOOKED OVER TRYING TO GET LIABILITY REFORM DONE. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE OF THAT THE SAME TIME WE DO HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM ABOUT TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND DEALING WITH -- WITH WITH WITH THE GENIE THAT ISRAEL IS VERY REAL. WE HAVE TO HAVE COURAGE UP HERE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. AND IN REGARDS TO A BAILOUT I THINK I'VE BEEN HERE FROM LOTS OF FOLKS TALKING ABOUT THE STRESS TEST SOMETHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENED. IN SAN BRUNO WERE LITERALLY TAKING THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE GONNA TARGET TAKE THE BIGGEST BITE BEFORE THERE'S GONNA BE A COST RECOVERY. FROM RATEPAYERS I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY UP HERE TALK ABOUT THE BAILING OUT THAT PETE YOU NEED ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AND DOING ANY TYPE OF COST RECOVERY. ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS WE STILL HAVE TO WORK SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE DETAILS OUT BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY SAY. THAT NOW WE'RE GONNA BELT BILL ANYBODY OUT. ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE I IN REGARDS TO THAT THE HARDENING THAT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S MEASURES IN PLACE. THAT ARE ALSO PROTECT RATEPAYERS UP I THINK FOR ALL OF US WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RATE PAYERS ARE PROTECTED AND IT'S A BALLOTS. I TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOME A MEMBER DOLLARS SO I'M REAL REAL QUICK I HAD MY COLLEAGUE. TALK ABOUT FIREWORKS SHOW YOU THIS MAP HANGS MY OFFICE EVERY DAY. AND WHEN IT'S UPDATED. WHICH HAPPENS ABOUT EVERY YEAR. IT'S GETTING MORE RED. THIS IS THE PROBLEM. WE'VE GOT A FEW YEARS OF REALLY CATASTROPHIC EVENTS THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST WHICH IS WHAT PUT US IN THIS POSITION. SO I WANT TO SAY TO THOSE WHO ARE. TALKING ABOUT THE SIZE OF A TREE YOU CAN CUT AND THE VEGETATION. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR SIX YEARS. THE REASON YOU CAN CUT A TWENTY SIX HISTORY WITH AN EXEMPTION IS BECAUSE I AUTHORED THAT BILL. AND IT WAS EIGHTEEN WHEN I CAME HERE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CUTTING THIRTY SIX HAS TREES THAT WAS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT WAS NOT. MISTER WOOD IN MINE. SO I WILL ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE DOING PRUDENT AND THE M. WHEREVER SHE WHERE THE QUADRATIC ME SO WE CAN GET IN THE WEEDS WE REALLY WANT TO START TALKING ABOUT. GOOD FORESTRY AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE BECAUSE I DON'T EITHER. BUT I WILL SAY ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE A REPUTATION OF DOING THE RIGHT THING WHEN IT COMES TO BEING ON THE GROUND AND TAKING CARE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND MAKING IT FIRE RESILIENT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IN AND I SAID EARLIER IN THE FOREST. WE ARE GONNA DO WE HAVE TOO MANY TREES AND SOME OF THOSE TREES. A LITTLE BIT BIGGER AND ACTUALLY THOSE ONES A LITTLE BIT BIGGER HAVE VALUE AND HELPS US PAY ITS WAY OUT. SO WE'LL BE DOING THAT DYNAMIC BALANCE AT THE AT THE RIGHT WAY. AND IT WILL BE ALL UP FRONT AND WILL NOT BE A THIRTY SIX HISTORY AND THE ACTUAL SIZE OF TREES PER ACRE WILL GO UP BECAUSE WE'RE TAKE ON THE LITTLE ONES OUT THANK YOU. I I JUST LIKE. TO THERE'S LOT OF IMPORTANT THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID -- AND THE COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC IS ALWAYS APPRECIATED I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT HOWEVER THIS ULTIMATELY PLAYS OUT IT WILL BE SOME TYPE OF RECOMMENDATION THAT WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR. THE OTHER PART I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. IS THAT BEFORE THIS. CONFERENCE COMMITTEE STARTED MEETING. IN THE SUMMER. OF JULY WE STARTED HEARING THAT SOMEHOW. WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING DECISIONS OUT OF THE PUBLIC'S EYE OF THE VIEW AND MAYBE NOT TAKING EVERYONE'S. AKA POINTS INTO CONSIDERATION I LIKE TO THINK I'VE HEARD AT LEAST A FEW PEOPLE SAY TODAY THAT. THAT'S NOT THE CASE THIS HAS BEEN A TRANCE PARENT PROCESS. AND WE TRIED TO COVERS MANY ELEMENTS OF WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. AND NOW WE ARE. LITERALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT. AS WE'VE ALL SAID. OF THE DETAILS ARE YET TO BE HASHED OUT. A BUT I THINK YOU DO LEAST CONCEDE THE THE DIRECTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO AND AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT ERECTION AND I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE. TO ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE AS RESPONSIVE AS WE HAVE BEEN TO BECAUSE WE CAN BE TO ALL THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT REPRESENTED SO. I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE AND FOR YOU ALL PARTICIPATING BECAUSE YOUR HELP SAVE. OUR THINKING AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE REPORT. OKAY -- GIVEN THE OUTLINE WHICH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BASED ON OUR PRIOR HEARINGS AND INPUT I THE PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY. I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD DIRECTION TO STAFF TING. THE CONFERENCE REPORT. I BELIEVE THAT REPORT WILL REFLECT A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT WILL HELP STOP FIRES FROM SPARKING IN SPREADING UNCONTROLLABLY. SAY BEING COMMUNITIES OF TAXPAYER SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN AVOID AND INVOICE BEING -- DISASTERS AND PROTECT UTILITY RAPIERS FROM BEARING AND DO COSTS. WE HEAR THE PROPOSED CONFERENCE REPORT WE WILL HEAR THE PROPOSED CONFERENCE REPORT WHEN WE CAN BE NEXT WEEK. AGAIN I'D LIKE TO THANK MY CO CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN AND HIS STAFF IN OUR FELLOW CONFEREES AND STAFF -- OF IT FOR EVERYONE -- WHOSE PROVIDED -- ALSO ALL OF YOU THEY'RE PRETTY PROVIDED PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THIS MEETINGS ADJOURNMENT
