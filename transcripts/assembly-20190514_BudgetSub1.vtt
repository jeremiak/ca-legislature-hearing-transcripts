THAT WHERE IT BENEFITS WHERE

00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:13.510
BENEFICIARIES THE PROGRAMS TEND

00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:15.178
TO WORK AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED

WET LOAN REPAYMENT WHEN THEY

00:56:30.653 --> 00:56:32.155
WERE WORKING HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:32.789
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:34.624
SUPERVISOR HOURS SO THEY CENTER

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.159
OVER TO ANOTHER FACILITY THAT

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.660
DOES SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.095

YOU AREN'T ACTUALLY DOING WHAT

00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:51.775
WHAT THE INITIATIVE WAS INTENDED

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:53.143
TO ADDRESS WHICH IS WHY THERE IS

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:55.011

PROFESSION I GUESS.

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:35.185
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ID

00:57:35.251 --> 00:57:37.120
POPULATION ARE WE GOING IN AND

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:38.755

00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:41.891
THE DUAL DIAGNOSIS IS NOW?

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.726
ARE WE GONNA HAVE A CATEGORY

00:57:43.793 --> 00:57:44.694
THAT ACTUALLY.

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:46.162
HAS A PROFESSIONAL THAT CAN

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:47.564
ACTUALLY.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.632
ADDRESS.

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:51.067
THE IDT COMPONENT PLUS THE

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:55.505
MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES I GO ON

00:57:55.572 --> 00:57:58.308
HOW FOR FOR A TRAINING PROGRAM --

00:57:58.374 --> 00:57:59.943
I'M NOT SURE I'D HAVE TO GET

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:00.543
BACK TO YOU.

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:01.945
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE

00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:04.948
BECAUSE I THINK THAT.

00:58:05.014 --> 00:58:07.550
WHEN WE START SEILING? ONE

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:09.919
SPECIFIC CHALLENGE THE WEEK

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:14.057
ALLEVIATE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY.

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:16.993
THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:17.293
[inaudible]

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:20.196
I ONE OF THE THINGS IT SEEMS

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:21.831
LIKE A THEME THAT I KEEP SEEING

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:25.235
IN MANY OF THE ANALYSIS IS THAT --

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:27.003
THE INLAND EMPIRE SANJOAQUIN.

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:31.007
ARE -- BEHIND IN SO MANY WAYS.

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:34.277
AND I THINK THAT FOR ME I'VE

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:36.412
ALWAYS WHEN I'VE TAUGHT AT HOLLY

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:37.146
I ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE

00:58:37.213 --> 00:58:38.615
CONCEPT OF EQUITY VERSUS

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:39.949
EQUALITY.

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:42.118
THE BEFORE WE CAN START BRINGING

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.820
EVERYBODY UP TO THE SITE TO

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:45.188
GIVING EVERYBODY THE SAME THING.

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:46.656
THOSE WHO ARE BEHIND HAVE TO BE

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:48.358
BROUGHT UP.

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:49.592
SO THAT WE DO HAVE EQUITY.

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.361
AT IN THERE'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:53.429
AYE AYE I WOULD REQUEST VERY%

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:54.697
SPECIFICALLY.

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:56.799
THAT IF WE KNOW THAT THE INLAND

00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:58.134
EMPIRE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:01.437
ARE SO BEHIND AND THEY HAVE SUCH

00:59:01.504 --> 00:59:03.339
A GREAT NEED THAT IS ALREADY

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:04.674
DOCUMENTED.

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:07.543
THEN I I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:08.778
THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANOTHER

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.413
STUDY TO DETERMINE.

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.948
HOW FAR BEHIND THE ARE WE

00:59:12.015 --> 00:59:14.183
ALREADY KNOW THERE BEHIND -- BUT

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.985
I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR ABOUT

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:17.654
DOING A REGIONAL NEEDS

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.655
ASSESSMENT.

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:20.657
I HOPE THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE.

00:59:20.723 --> 00:59:24.027
THIS ASPECT OF IT -- BECAUSE

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:27.830
IT'S ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED.

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:28.431
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:30.300
COUNT ON I WOULD BELIEVE THAT

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:31.601
THE THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.036
YOU'VE CORROBORATE.

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:34.137
THAT THERE ARE SHORTAGES THERE

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:34.938
AND THEN THE FUNDING WOULD BE

00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:36.606
TARGETED IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:38.908
THE GREATEST NEED.

00:59:38.975 --> 00:59:39.742
DO WE NEED ANOTHER NEEDS

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:41.678
ASSESSMENT.

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:42.412
THE WAY TO THE NEEDS DOESN'T

00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:43.913
WORK IS THAT THE COUNTIES WOULD

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.548
PUT FORTH -- MORE LIKE PROPOSALS

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:47.150
ABOUT HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:48.551
ALLOCATED WITHIN THE WEB PLAN

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:49.352
AND WITHIN THE DIFFERENT

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:51.587
PROGRAMS -- AND AND HOW THEY

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:54.357
WOULD USE THE FUNDS TO AS I SAID.

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:56.225
I ALLOCATE BETWEEN PIPELINE A

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:57.660
RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:59.595
SCHOLARSHIPS LOAN REPAYMENT

00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:01.164
BECAUSE ONE REGION MIGHT HAVE A

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.032
NEED FOR LOAN REPAYMENT TO

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.233
RETAIN THEIR EXISTING WORKFORCE

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.035
WHERE IS ANOTHER REGION MAY HAVE

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.137
A HIGHER NEED FOR SCHOLARSHIPS --

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:09.205
AND SO THAT WOULD START TO DRIVE

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.440
HOW THAT FUNDING WOULD WORK AND

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:11.474
THROUGH THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT I

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.842
THINK WE WOULD SEE THE EXACT

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:13.943
SAME THINGS.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:14.944
THIS IS A LITTLE MORE DETAILED

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:16.112
AND EXACTLY WHERE THE SHORTAGES

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:17.547
ARE ABOUT HOW THE REGION'S WOULD

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:20.750
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:23.920
BEEN DOCUMENTED -- AT THE THINK

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:24.854
ONE ISSUE THAT WE'RE WE'RE

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.823
BEGINNING TO EXPLORE IS THAT THE

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:28.825
OFTEN FOR TO GET FUNDING THROUGH

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.793
THE EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS --

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.662
YOU CAN QUALIFY UNDER A NUMBER

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:34.330
OF DIFFERENT CRITERIA SUCH AS

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:36.833
THE NUMBER OF MEDICAID LIVES OR

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:38.601
SORT OF A OTHER GENERAL CRITERIA

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:39.802
WHETHER OR NOT YOUR SAFETY NET

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.237
CLINIC AND SO FORTH.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.306
AND WHILE -- SERVING THOSE

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:44.440
GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITH THE YOU

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:46.209
KNOW AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL --

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.944
WORK FORCE FOR THOSE GROUPS IS

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.946
ABSOLUTELY LAUDABLE IT COULD

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:51.814
HAVE THE EFFECT OF NOT

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:55.651
NECESSARILY -- GOD DIRECTING THE

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:58.087
THE FUNDING TOWARDS SAY SPECIFIC

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.255
REGIONS AND SO FOR THE COULD

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.957
DILUTED A LITTLE BIT THROUGHOUT

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:01.858
THE STATE AND BE CREATING SOME

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:03.159
OF THAT MISMATCH BUT WE'RE

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:04.827
FINDING BETWEEN -- WHERE

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:06.629
BENEFICIARIES END UP WORKING

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:08.664
AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED THERE'S --

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:12.802
OBLIGATIONS AND WHERE THE MOST

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:13.770
ACUTE NEEDS ARE.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.238
IT ANOTHER CONCERN AND IT'S BEEN

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.706
BROUGHT UP IN THIS COMMITTEE AS

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.107
WELL AS OTHERS IS THAT

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.777
OFTENTIMES FUNDING GOES TO THOSE.

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.312
WHO ARE MOST ADEPT AT WRITING

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:24.447
GRANTS?

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.449
AND WRITE BEEN DESCRIBING THE

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.117
NEED AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WITH

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:29.852
THE GREATEST NEED -- THAT WAS

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:31.821
TRUE WHEN WE DISCUSS THE WILD

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.956
FIRES AND HOW THERE WAS GREAT

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.792
NEED IN SOME AREAS BUTTHEY

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.060
DIDN'T HAVE.

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.529
THE PERSONNEL TO PUT TOGETHER

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:40.830
THE GROUNDS AND SO.

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.732
RETHINKING HOW FUNDING IS

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:44.801
ALLOCATED SO THAT IT REALLY DOES

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:45.968
GO TO THOSE WITH THE GREATEST

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.904
NEED AND SOMETIMES THAT REQUIRES

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:51.107
MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO BE

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.442
SURE THAT AGAIN THAT WERE.

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:54.510
LOOKING AT EQUITY TO PROVIDE

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.446
THOSE WHO MOST NEED IT TO BRING

01:01:56.512 --> 01:02:01.751
THEM UP. TO AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL --

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:03.186
EIGHT ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS.

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:05.655
DOES THE WEB PLAN SEEK TO

01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:11.627
LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDING. FOR THE

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:12.361
DEFERRED.

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:12.995
CHECK MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.630
AT THIS POINT TIME OR SIMPLY

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:16.332
REQUESTING A HUNDRED MILLION

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.233
DOLLARS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.768
ACT FUNDING AND THERE'S NO

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.203
ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUILT INTO.

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:21.504
THIS REQUEST THAT WOULD HELP

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:25.942
FUND WHAT IMPLEMENTATION.

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:26.509
AT THE STATE LEVEL OR COUNTY

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:29.812
LEVEL.

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.581
THE LA AND IF I IF I MAY ADD A

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:32.715
IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:35.718
SORT OF WHAT THAT WHAT IT WOULD

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.987
TAKE TO SORT OF REQUIRE A LOCAL

LOCAL MATCH AND SO FORTH THE

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:40.923
ONLY THING I WOULD ADD HERE IS

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.757
THAT.

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:44.827
THE LOCALS DO GET -- A PORTION

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.796
OF THEIR IMAGES A FUNDING CAN BE

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:48.498
USED FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ONE

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.341
OPTION WOULD BE -- TO

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:01.277
POTENTIALLY BE TO SORT OF HAVE

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:03.646
THEM MATCH YOU KNOW STAY

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:06.149

HAVING DIFFERENT CAPACITIES TO

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:33.409
PROVIDE THE SERVICES I THINK

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:35.211
REQUIRING A LOCAL MATCH FOR

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:37.446
THESE DOLLARS MAY EXACERBATE

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:38.714
THOSE ISSUES.

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.816
AS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:43.419
AND SOMETIMES IT'S IT SOMETIMES

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:43.953
WHAT'S NEEDED IS CAPACITY

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.389
BUILDING -- AT THE VERY LEAST

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:47.924

ANALYSIS ON THE FIRST THREE

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:02.371
YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND WE

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:03.906
FOUND THAT.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:05.942
MOST OF THE RECIPIENTS INDICATED

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:14.016
HAVE WILL TAKE A LONGER TIME

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:15.351
FRAME TO COME UP WITH MORE

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.820

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:48.482
BALLOT AND GET IT PASSED BECAUSE

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:49.650
WE COULDN'T FIND ANOTHER

01:34:49.717 --> 01:34:51.786
RESOURCE.

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.120
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:54.655
GOVERNOR OF LAST GOVERNOR FELT

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:55.589
THAT THEY COULD TAKE SOME OF

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:57.291
THIS MONEY AND USE IT AND AND

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:58.426
THEY HAVE.

01:34:58.492 --> 01:34:59.493
AND IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.995
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS NEW

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:02.596
ADMINISTRATION HERE AS WELL.

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:03.831
AND THERE'S NOT MUCH THERE'S NOT

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:05.199
MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT I

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:06.834
THINK WE ACCEPT THAT.

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:08.035
BUT I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.603
SENT TO THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:11.005
THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:12.506
FIGHT FOR THIS OVER AND OVER AND

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:14.408
OVER AGAIN WHEN WE ALREADY KNOW

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:16.143
THAT THE BUDGET PROCESS WE CAN

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:17.044
MAKE THESE CUTS.

01:35:17.111 --> 01:35:19.513
I THINK IS IS GROSSLY UNFAIR.

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.614
WE ARE TRYING TO GET MORE AND

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:22.016

I'M SORRY THAT'S I DON'T SEE HOW

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:28.989

IT WE'RE GONNA BE EXPANDING

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:31.959

01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:49.603
LESS RESOURCES WE KNOW THAT'S

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:50.237
ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY IS DOCTOR

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:52.039
WOULD IS IT HAS SAID WE HAVE THE

01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:54.808
ABILITY TO THEN COME TOGETHER IN

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:56.243
THE BUDGET.

01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:58.312
AND REDUCE OR OR ELIMINATE

01:41:58.378 --> 01:41:59.880
WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE.

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:02.082
BUT THE STABILITY THAT IS NEEDED

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:03.851
FOR THE PROVIDERS AND FOR THOSE

01:42:03.917 --> 01:42:05.586
DATES THE SERVICE EXTREMELY

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:06.854
IMPORTANT.

NOT JUST HERE BUT YET IT IS

01:42:12.893 --> 01:42:14.428
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE DON'T SET

01:42:14.495 --> 01:42:17.498
A PRECEDENT THAT DURING THE THE

01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:19.233
THE YEARS WHEN WE DO HAVE A

01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:20.200
SURPLUS.

01:42:20.267 --> 01:42:21.735
THAT IN THOSE YEARS WE ARE STILL

01:42:21.802 --> 01:42:25.038
NOT PROVIDING THE STABILITY THAT

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:27.708
THAT IS NEEDED IN A PROGRAM SUCH

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:29.343
AS THIS.

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:30.377

PRESENTED IN THE MAY REVIEW

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:22.289
REVISION.

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:23.523
THERE ARE TWO MAIN CHANGES THAT

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:25.225
YOU'LL SEE IN THIS PORTION THE

01:44:25.292 --> 01:44:26.994
FIRST ONE BEING THE PROPOSED

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:29.463
IMPLEMENTATION DATE -- NOW BEING

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:32.566
PROPOSES JANUARY -- ONE TWENTY

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:33.600
TWENTY THE REASON WHY WE ARE PER

01:44:33.667 --> 01:44:34.968
PROPOSING THIS REVISED

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:36.637
IMPLEMENTATION DAYS TO ENSURE

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:38.505
THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE READY FOR

01:44:38.572 --> 01:44:39.573
THE TRANSITION.

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.274
IF YOU HAVE PROPER COMMUNICATION

01:44:41.341 --> 01:44:43.143
OUT TO THE BENEFICIARIES -- AND

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:44.211
TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY

01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:45.779
INCLUDING OUR COUNTIES ARE READY

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:47.280
TO TRANSITION SUCCESSFULLY WE

01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:49.416
DID LEARN FROM THE PREVIOUS

01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:50.817
IMPLEMENTATION AND SO WE DO HAVE

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:52.586
SOME EXPERIENCE IN INFORMATION

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:54.688
ABOUT -- HOW LONG IT TAKES TO

01:44:54.755 --> 01:44:56.056
PREPARE SYSTEMS -- AND TO

01:44:56.123 --> 01:44:57.424
COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY TO

01:44:57.491 --> 01:44:59.226
INDIVIDUALS ABOUT THE CHANGE --

01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:00.160
SO THAT'S THE THE FIRST CHANGE

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:02.295
THE SECOND CHANGE IS GOING TO BE

01:45:02.362 --> 01:45:04.331
THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF THE

01:45:04.398 --> 01:45:05.532
COVERED BUYS WHICH YOU'LL SEE AN

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.901
ADJUSTMENT SLIGHTLY -- TO WHAT

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.436
WE ARE PROPOSING AS AN ESTIMATED

01:45:09.503 --> 01:45:11.605
TO EXTEND FULL SO COVERAGE TO

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:12.606
NINETY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:14.007
SEVENTY FOR A 75% OF THOSE

01:45:14.074 --> 01:45:15.242
INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE

01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:16.977
TRANSITIONING FROM CURRENT

01:45:17.044 --> 01:45:18.345
RESTRICTED SCOPE TO FULL SCOPE.

01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:19.913
AND THE OTHERS WOULD TRANSITION

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:21.715
AS A PHASED IN -- OVER A TWELVE

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:25.452
MONTH PERIOD.

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:26.086
THAT IS ALL MY COMMENTS AT THIS

DECREASING COSTS THAT IS

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:43.770
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SIX MONTH

DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:40.560
TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA THAT LATELY

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:41.995
LATEST DATA USED IN.

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:43.864
THIS UPDATED ESTIMATE THAT SHOWS

01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:45.031
THAT THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTED

01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:46.900
SCOPE INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:48.502
MEDICARE AL HAS BEEN DECREASING

01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:50.237
SINCE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AS WELL

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:52.339
AS THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN

SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SO WE FEEL

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:07.954
THAT THE ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS TO

01:47:08.021 --> 01:47:08.955
BE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN

01:47:09.022 --> 01:47:09.222
ELIGIBLE.

01:47:09.289 --> 01:47:11.958
IS A REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT

01:47:12.025 --> 01:47:12.592

IMPLEMENTATION DATE -- TO HALF

01:47:22.903 --> 01:47:25.505
YEAR JUST NOTING THAT THERE ARE --

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:27.040
PROCESS SEES THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:28.375
DOES HAVE TO UNDERTAKE TO AFFECT

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:30.443
THAT TRANSITION -- AND THEN ON

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:33.313
CASELOAD -- WE ARE WORKING AND

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:34.314
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:41.888
ABOUT -- THE CASELOAD DECLINE

ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATES THAT

01:47:49.996 --> 01:47:51.832
DOES -- THAT WOULD REDUCE OUR

01:47:51.898 --> 01:47:53.767
PROJECTIONS OF ON GOING GENERAL

01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:55.168
FUND COSTS BY ABOUT EIGHTY

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:57.637

UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY CERTAINLY

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:33.566

BUT YET.

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:08.988

01:57:35.214 --> 01:57:37.850
AND OUR PARENTS CAN'T GET IN TO

01:57:37.917 --> 01:57:39.719
SEE THEIR DOCTORS NORMALLY GET

01:57:39.786 --> 01:57:41.587

WITH THE ZERO ACCESS.

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:16.522
BECAUSE NOBODY HAS THE ABILITY

TO GET IN.

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:25.331

BEING A SPECIALTY THAT IS

02:01:35.621 --> 02:01:37.256
PARTICULARLY HARD FOR US TO

02:01:37.323 --> 02:01:38.991
RECRUIT IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM

02:01:39.058 --> 02:01:40.960

WANT TO SAY THAT WE'RE REALLY

02:01:50.736 --> 02:01:53.372
EXCITED ABOUT THE RESPONSE --

02:01:53.439 --> 02:01:55.207
FROM THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY FOR

02:01:55.274 --> 02:01:56.709
THE APPLICATION OF THOSE FUNDS

02:01:56.776 --> 02:01:58.310

SO MORE ON THAT BUT CERTAINLY --

02:02:08.854 --> 02:02:11.057
APPRECIATING AND WANTING -- TO

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:12.291
EMPATHIZE ABOUT THE NEED TO

02:02:12.358 --> 02:02:13.659
CONTINUE TO GROW THE WORK FIRST

02:02:13.726 --> 02:02:15.861
AND KEEP THOSE MEDICAL STUDENTS --

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:17.930
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:02:17.997 --> 02:02:18.531
RATHER THAN GOING ELSEWHERE TO

02:02:18.597 --> 02:02:20.599
PRACTICE.

02:02:20.666 --> 02:02:21.801
YES DOCTOR WOULD.

02:02:21.867 --> 02:02:23.869

WITH THE GARCIA REPORT TO BE

02:02:24.737 --> 02:02:26.472
CONSIDERED -- THOSE SAME KINDS

02:02:26.539 --> 02:02:27.506

PRACTITIONERS PHYSICIAN'S

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:30.843
ASSISTANTS.

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:32.845
NURSES BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY WE

02:02:32.912 --> 02:02:33.813
NEED THE DENTISTS AND WE NEED

02:02:33.879 --> 02:02:36.048
THE POSITIONS BUT WE ALSO NEED

02:02:36.115 --> 02:02:37.483
THOSE AS WELL AND WE NEED THEM

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:39.385
IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE SHORTAGE

02:02:39.452 --> 02:02:42.588
AREAS MY ENTIRE DISTRICT IS A IS

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:44.523
A IS A HEALTH MANPOWER SHORTAGE.

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:47.026
AND SO I I THAT'S THE WORLD THAT

02:02:47.093 --> 02:02:50.596
THAT THA I LIVE IN BUT HAS HAD

02:02:50.663 --> 02:02:51.197
CONSIDERED GOING BEYOND THAT

02:02:51.263 --> 02:02:53.466
BECAUSE HE HAD DOCTORS DON'T

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.334
WORK WELL WITHOUT NURSES AND AND

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:56.736
AND ALL THESE OTHERS AND AND

02:02:56.802 --> 02:02:58.204
WHILE WE'RE MAKING THAT

02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:59.171
INVESTMENT.

02:02:59.238 --> 02:02:59.839
CAN WE MAKE THE INVESTMENT ON A

02:02:59.905 --> 02:03:01.407
BROADER ON A LITTLE BROADER

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:03.342
BASIS YEAH I THINK THAT PART OF

02:03:03.409 --> 02:03:05.044
THE CONSIDERATION AND CERTAINLY

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:06.879
THAT HAS BEEN RECESSED ABOUT

02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:08.814
USING THE LOAN -- FUNDS FOR

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:09.615
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROVIDERS I

02:03:09.682 --> 02:03:11.584
THINK JUST EVEN BASED ON THE

02:03:11.650 --> 02:03:13.052
OVERWHELMING.

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:14.820
RESPONSE FROM THOSE TWO PROVIDER

02:03:14.887 --> 02:03:16.722
TYPES -- IT WOULD BE IN SOME

02:03:16.789 --> 02:03:18.758
CASES -- A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION

02:03:18.824 --> 02:03:19.925
TO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW IF YOU

02:03:19.992 --> 02:03:21.660
WANT TO COVER MORE PEOPLE OR

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:22.495
DIFFERENT TO PROVIDER TYPES YOU

02:03:22.561 --> 02:03:24.330
LOWER THE DOLLAR AMOUNT SO THAT

02:03:24.396 --> 02:03:25.197
YOU CAN TRY TO INCREASE YOU KNOW

02:03:25.264 --> 02:03:26.298
THERE'S THERE'S ALWAYS THAT

02:03:26.365 --> 02:03:27.533
BALANCE I THINK THE OTHER THING

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.834
THAT I THINK ABOUT.

02:03:28.901 --> 02:03:30.436
IS THERE ARE OTHER LOAN

02:03:30.503 --> 02:03:33.139
REPAYMENT PROGRAMS THAT WITH --

02:03:33.205 --> 02:03:36.041
ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS BEING SO

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:37.510
YOU CAN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR

02:03:37.576 --> 02:03:38.711
LOAN REPAYMENT AND ALSO GET LOAN

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:39.879
REPAYMENT FROM DIFFERENT PLACES

02:03:39.945 --> 02:03:41.380
AND SOME IN SOME CASES WE WILL

02:03:41.447 --> 02:03:42.815
BE RELIEVING.%

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.283
AND OR ALLOWING FOR GREATER

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:46.152
CAPACITY FOR OTHER PROVIDERS TO

02:03:46.218 --> 02:03:47.653
BE ELIGIBLE FOR LOANS WHERE THEY

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.255
WERE COMPETING AGAINST OTHER

02:03:49.321 --> 02:03:49.889
PROVIDERS AND I THINK IF THERE

02:03:49.955 --> 02:03:50.723
ARE.

02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:52.158
CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:53.993
OTHER TYPES OF LOAN REPAYMENT IN

02:03:54.059 --> 02:03:56.128
CALIFORNIA THROUGH EITHER OFSHE

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:58.130
BETTER OTHERWISE -- TO INCREASE

02:03:58.197 --> 02:03:59.131
THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO

02:03:59.198 --> 02:04:00.332
COMPETE I THINK WHAT WE WERE

02:04:00.399 --> 02:04:02.735
TRYING TO DO IS CERTAINLY ALLOW

02:04:02.802 --> 02:04:03.536
FOR AN A LARGER NUMBER OF

02:04:03.602 --> 02:04:05.171
APPLICANTS ACROSS PROVIDER TYPES

02:04:05.237 --> 02:04:07.072
TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

02:04:07.139 --> 02:04:11.844
THAT KIND OF THAT.

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:13.712
INCENTIVE TO PROVIDE CARE.

02:04:13.779 --> 02:04:14.980

A COINCIDENCE I JUST RAN INTO A

02:04:16.849 --> 02:04:18.717
YOUNG LADY WHO IS A CLINICAL

02:04:18.784 --> 02:04:20.386
PSYCHOLOGIST GOING FOR SOCIETY.

02:04:20.452 --> 02:04:23.455
AND SHE SHARED WITH ME HER LOANS.

02:04:23.522 --> 02:04:25.591
RIGHT NOW TO DATE JUST TO HAVE A

02:04:25.658 --> 02:04:28.928
MASTER SHE HAS 200-900-0300

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:29.428
TWENTY THREE THOUSAND IN

02:04:29.495 --> 02:04:32.464
PRINCIPLE. TWENTY THOUSAND AND

02:04:32.531 --> 02:04:33.866
FOURTEEN DOLLARS IN.

02:04:33.933 --> 02:04:36.969
INTEREST AND THEN SHE HAD TWELVE

02:04:37.036 --> 02:04:37.736
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:04:37.803 --> 02:04:41.106
FIVE DOLLARS AND PELL GRANTS.

02:04:41.173 --> 02:04:42.808
AND SHE STILL HAS TO OFFER SO ID.

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:45.311
WHY WOULD SHE?

02:04:45.377 --> 02:04:47.713
IF YOU CAN'T GET RELIEF.

02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:48.581
CHRIS CAN MAKE THIS UP I MEAN

02:04:48.647 --> 02:04:50.382
WITH THE COST OF LIVING AND

02:04:50.449 --> 02:04:51.016
EVERYTHING LIKE THAT SO.

02:04:51.083 --> 02:04:52.451
I MEAN.

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:53.986
WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE CRITICAL

02:04:54.053 --> 02:04:57.957

02:04:58.023 --> 02:04:59.325
WITH YOU SHE ENTERED INTO THE

GET OUR SIDE YOU SHE JUST CAN'T

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:05.664
TAKE MORE DEBT.

02:05:05.731 --> 02:05:06.532
WITHOUT A REAL BILL YOU TO KNOW

02:05:06.599 --> 02:05:07.600
THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF

02:05:07.666 --> 02:05:09.735
RELIEF AND THAT SHE CAN ACTUALLY

02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:13.639
APPLY HER CRAFT.

02:05:13.706 --> 02:05:14.473
I THINK ARE MAKING IT VERY

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:17.643
ONEROUS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:18.277
BE ABLE TO TREAT THE INDIVIDUALS

02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:18.944
THAT.

02:05:19.011 --> 02:05:20.379
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF

02:05:20.446 --> 02:05:21.947
I MEAN I THINK WE FEEL VERY

02:05:22.014 --> 02:05:23.582
STRONGLY ABOUT THE LOAN

02:05:23.649 --> 02:05:26.719
REPAYMENT THAT WE HAVE INITIATED --

02:05:26.785 --> 02:05:28.087
FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE WILL

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:30.656
BE ESSENTIALLY WITH UP TO THREE

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:31.490
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH

02:05:31.557 --> 02:05:33.859
IS A IS A REALLY -- EXTENSIVE

02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:35.594
AMOUNT OF LOAN REPAYMENT FOR

02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:38.197
PROVIDERS -- IN OUR THINKING IT

02:05:38.264 --> 02:05:40.499
WAS TO CHANGE THE ECONOMIC

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:42.368
DECISION AROUND WHERE PROVIDERS.

02:05:42.434 --> 02:05:44.169
PRACTICE WHEN THEY GRADUATE --

02:05:44.236 --> 02:05:46.105
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE A GRADUATE

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:47.306
WITHOUT MUCH DEBT PLUS YOU'RE

02:05:47.373 --> 02:05:48.741
TRYING TO BUY A HOUSE OR START A

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:50.142
FAMILY OR DO ALL THE OTHER

02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:51.277
THINGS THAT SUCH A CHALLENGE

02:05:51.343 --> 02:05:53.245
THAT YOU WOULD BE -- HARD

02:05:53.312 --> 02:05:55.314
PRESSED TO TAKE A JOB IN EITHER

02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:57.349
UNDERSERVED AREA OR IN A SAFETY

02:05:57.416 --> 02:05:57.950
NET.

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.418
PROVIDER TYPE OF CAPACITY I

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:00.586
THINK WE'RE TRYING TO

02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:01.887
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:02.788
ECONOMIC DECISIONS THAT

02:06:02.855 --> 02:06:03.989
INDIVIDUALS MAKE AND I THINK

02:06:04.056 --> 02:06:05.758
THAT'S WHAT IS SO EXCITING ABOUT

02:06:05.824 --> 02:06:07.459
THE ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND AND

02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:09.028
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

02:06:09.094 --> 02:06:11.730
KIND OF LONG RANGE -- AND IN

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:13.265
VETTING OF PROVIDERS IN CERTAIN

02:06:13.332 --> 02:06:14.566
PARTS OF THE STATE THAT THEY

02:06:14.633 --> 02:06:17.336
OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

02:06:17.403 --> 02:06:19.171
ABLE TO PRACTICE IT.

02:06:19.238 --> 02:06:20.806
SO JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY.

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:21.674
WHAT WITH THEIR INCOME LEVEL BE

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:25.444
DIMINISHED BY TAKING THIS DEAL --

02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:27.346
RATHER THAN IF THEY WENT INTO

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:28.213
THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND AND

02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:29.581
STARTED OFF I MEAN.

02:06:29.648 --> 02:06:31.016

02:06:31.083 --> 02:06:32.318

02:06:32.384 --> 02:06:34.186
YEARS ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE

02:06:34.253 --> 02:06:34.887

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:36.989
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENTIAL.

YOU'RE OFFERING UP TO THREE

02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:41.226

LOW OF AN AMOUNT I THINK AND YOU

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:55.040

AND LASTLY THE THE NEIGHBOR

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:48.874

02:10:52.578 --> 02:10:53.679
BOARD.

02:10:53.745 --> 02:10:55.881
UNTIL THE BOARD'S TOTAL RESERVES

02:10:55.948 --> 02:10:58.550
REACH A REASONABLE LEVEL EQUAL

02:10:58.617 --> 02:10:59.885
TO TWO YEARS WORTH OF TOTAL

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:01.019

02:11:01.086 --> 02:11:02.621

02:11:05.724 --> 02:11:09.261
THAT 75%.

02:11:09.328 --> 02:11:10.395
NEXT RYAN WAS THE LEGISLATIVE

02:11:10.462 --> 02:11:12.197
ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST A FEW

02:11:12.264 --> 02:11:13.565
COMMENTS ON THIS WERE STILL

02:11:13.632 --> 02:11:15.767
REVIEWING THESE CHANGES AND AND

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:17.469
I LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THAT

02:11:17.536 --> 02:11:19.972
THE REVISED LANGUAGE -- THE

02:11:20.038 --> 02:11:21.406
FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS

02:11:21.473 --> 02:11:24.343
THAT -- WE NOTED EARLIER IN THIS

02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:25.944
YEAR THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT.

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:27.346
SOME OF THE FOR COUNTIES OR

02:11:27.412 --> 02:11:27.913
REFERENCE COULD HAVE SOME

02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:30.082
SAVINGS FROM THE EXPANSION OF

02:11:30.148 --> 02:11:31.783
MEDICARE ALL TO THE UNDOCUMENTED

02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:33.285
YOUNG ADULT POPULATION.

02:11:33.352 --> 02:11:34.519
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS SENSUALLY

02:11:34.586 --> 02:11:36.622
A A POLICY CHOICE TO ALLOW THOSE

02:11:36.688 --> 02:11:37.956
FUNDS TO REMAIN AT THE LOCAL

02:11:38.023 --> 02:11:39.491
LEVEL FOR LOCAL PRIORITIES

02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:41.293
THAT'S A REASONABLE PRIORITY --

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.060
BUT ONE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:11:42.127 --> 02:11:44.463
SHOULD WEIGH AGAINST ITS OTHER

02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:45.731
PRIORITIES IN THE BUDGET -- THE

02:11:45.797 --> 02:11:47.599
NEXT THING IS IS THAT WE WE

02:11:47.666 --> 02:11:49.268
CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS

02:11:49.334 --> 02:11:53.238
REASONABLE -- FOR THE THE STATE.

02:11:53.305 --> 02:11:56.275
TO AND THE STOP THE THE FLOW OF

02:11:56.341 --> 02:11:57.409
REALIGNMENT REVENUES TO THE SEEM

02:11:57.476 --> 02:11:59.344
AS P. BOARD UNTIL SUCH A TIME AS

02:11:59.411 --> 02:12:00.612
THE RESERVES COME DOWN TO A

02:12:00.679 --> 02:12:01.913
LOWER LEVEL.

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:03.815
AND THE REVISED TWO YEAR --

02:12:03.882 --> 02:12:05.651
TARGET RESERVE AMOUNT DOES

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:07.319
APPEAR REASONABLE TO US --

02:12:07.386 --> 02:12:09.888
HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT 75%

02:12:09.955 --> 02:12:11.690
RE DIRECTION -- EFFECTIVELY

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:14.593
TODAY RE DIRECTS ALL OF THE THE

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:15.227
SAME AS P. BOARDS REVENUES AND

02:12:15.294 --> 02:12:16.128
IT.

02:12:16.194 --> 02:12:17.629
LIKELY WOULD CONTINUE TO RE

02:12:17.696 --> 02:12:20.098
DIRECT ALL OF THOSE RESERVES HAD

02:12:20.165 --> 02:12:20.666
SUCH A POINT AS THEIR RECAP

02:12:20.732 --> 02:12:22.100
SORRY WOULD REDIRECT ALL THE

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:23.168
REVENUES AT SUCH A POINT IS

02:12:23.235 --> 02:12:24.369
THERE IS THERE IS REACH THE THE

02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:25.470
LOWER TARGET.

02:12:25.537 --> 02:12:29.107
SO IN THAT SENSE75% MAY STILL

02:12:29.174 --> 02:12:30.175
BE TOO HIGH.

02:12:30.242 --> 02:12:31.610
BUT IN ANOTHER SENSE SINCE THIS

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:33.312
WOULD TAKE PLACE SEVERAL YEARS

02:12:33.378 --> 02:12:34.913
OUT -- THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:37.716
NECESSARILY NEED TO SET THAT 75%

02:12:37.783 --> 02:12:39.518
LEVEL TODAY -- INSTEAD THE

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:42.020
LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT THAT NO

02:12:42.087 --> 02:12:42.888
ADDITIONAL REVENUES WOULD BE

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:44.690
PROVIDED UNTIL THE RESERVES

02:12:44.756 --> 02:12:46.158
REACH THAT LOWER LEVEL.

02:12:46.224 --> 02:12:47.359
AND THEN DIRECT THE

02:12:47.426 --> 02:12:48.927
ADMINISTRATION.

02:12:48.994 --> 02:12:49.695
TO RE ESTIMATE WHAT AN

02:12:49.761 --> 02:12:53.565
APPROPRIATE REDIRECTION AMOUNT

02:12:53.632 --> 02:12:56.468
WOULD BE AT THAT TIME

02:12:56.535 --> 02:12:56.768
[inaudible]

02:12:56.835 --> 02:13:01.106

FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND

02:19:24.556 --> 02:19:25.724
FIRST WHAT WE WANT TO THANK THE

02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:26.858
DEPARTMENT PLAN IS I I'M

02:19:26.925 --> 02:19:29.160
OFFENDED WITH ANY AGENCY SITS ON

02:19:29.227 --> 02:19:30.662
THIS MUCH MONEY.

02:19:30.729 --> 02:19:31.796
IT STAGNATES OF THE ABILITY TO

02:19:31.863 --> 02:19:33.531
HELP PEOPLE.

02:19:33.598 --> 02:19:34.499
I MEAN WE ALL HAVE AN

02:19:34.566 --> 02:19:36.201
EXPECTATION THE WIND OUT MONIES

02:19:36.267 --> 02:19:39.170
ALLOCATED GOES TO THE DIRECTION

02:19:39.237 --> 02:19:41.106
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE UTILIZED.

02:19:41.172 --> 02:19:43.341
AND I I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD

02:19:43.408 --> 02:19:45.577
ACTUALLY EVEN.

02:19:45.643 --> 02:19:46.711
LOOK SOMEBODY IN THE FACE WITH

02:19:46.778 --> 02:19:47.979
THIS MUCH MONEY NOT GOING OUT TO

02:19:48.046 --> 02:19:49.080
THIS POPULATION IN A TIMELY

02:19:49.147 --> 02:19:54.686
MANNER -- BUT I DO APPRECIATE

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:57.055
THE FACT THAT.

02:19:57.122 --> 02:19:59.190
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND

02:19:59.257 --> 02:19:59.958
THAT HOWEVER THIS HAPPENED

02:20:00.024 --> 02:20:00.258
[inaudible]

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:01.793
THAT.

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:04.162
THESE RESOURCES NEED TO BE

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:06.664
UTILIZED AND I THINK SEVENTY

02:20:06.731 --> 02:20:07.232
FIVE TWENTY FIVE IS A LITTLE

02:20:07.298 --> 02:20:07.999
ONEROUS.

02:20:08.066 --> 02:20:09.334
GOING FORWARD I HOPE WE CAN GET

02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:11.603
TO YES.

02:20:11.669 --> 02:20:13.638
WAS US YOU MUST BE.

02:20:13.705 --> 02:20:16.975
ON SOME KIND OF PROGRAM GOING.

02:20:17.041 --> 02:20:18.276
FOR BUT OBVIOUSLY HAD THIS NOT

02:20:18.343 --> 02:20:19.110
BEEN FOUND IT IS SITTING ON THIS

02:20:19.177 --> 02:20:20.845
NEXT YEAR THE NEXT YEAR THE NEXT

02:20:20.912 --> 02:20:21.446
YEAR.

02:20:21.513 --> 02:20:23.448
AND POSSIBLY MAY EVEN MAKING

02:20:23.515 --> 02:20:25.750
GROWING -- MAYBE IS THIS MUCH

02:20:25.817 --> 02:20:27.552
MONEY SITTING THERE LOOKING AT

02:20:27.619 --> 02:20:28.686
THEIR WORK FIRST DEVELOPMENT.

02:20:28.753 --> 02:20:30.355
THAT WE MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT

02:20:30.421 --> 02:20:32.791
AND MAKE THIS MONEY BE EXPENDED

02:20:32.857 --> 02:20:33.091
[inaudible]

02:20:33.158 --> 02:20:38.129
ON PROVIDERS -- AND AND THERE'S

02:20:38.196 --> 02:20:39.497
A RESOURCE ONE TIME FOR

02:20:39.564 --> 02:20:43.802
OPPORTUNITY -- THAT NEED NEEDS

02:20:43.868 --> 02:20:44.102
[inaudible]

02:20:44.169 --> 02:20:45.003
ARE THERE.

02:20:45.069 --> 02:20:45.804
SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN COME

02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:48.039
TO A SOLUTION AND HOW TO GET T.

02:20:48.106 --> 02:20:50.074
**** YOU KNOW BETWEEN FINANCE

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:55.547

BUT I'M I'M GONNA FALL IS

02:20:56.147 --> 02:21:00.318
CLOSELY -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT --

02:21:00.385 --> 02:21:01.920
IT'S ACTUALLY OFFENSIVE THAT

02:21:01.986 --> 02:21:03.354
THIS MUCH MONEY WAS NOT RESOURCE

02:21:03.421 --> 02:21:05.223

COMMENTS WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:22.941
ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN SURE

02:21:23.007 --> 02:21:27.946
SO -- THE NEXT ITEM -- IS

02:21:28.012 --> 02:21:30.081

WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE'S A

02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:04.562
COUPLE OF MISMATCHES IN THE

POPULATION THAT TARGET

02:25:12.170 --> 02:25:14.238
POPULATION MAY NOT BE EXACT LEE

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:37.388
WE MOVE OUR MANAGED CARE PROGRAM

02:31:37.455 --> 02:31:39.890
INTO THAT AND SO -- AND THERE'S

02:31:39.957 --> 02:31:41.125
DIFFERENT FEDERAL THINGS THAT

02:31:41.192 --> 02:31:43.227
ALLOW FOR THAT TO OCCUR I THINK

02:31:43.294 --> 02:31:44.528
WHAT WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE

02:31:44.595 --> 02:31:45.529
COUNTIES ON THAT ARE NOT

02:31:45.596 --> 02:31:46.664
CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING WHOLE

02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:48.065
PERSON CARE IS TECHNICAL

02:31:48.132 --> 02:31:50.401
ASSISTANCE TO HELP THEM -- DO

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:51.368
LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE

02:31:51.435 --> 02:31:52.403
COUNTIES THAT HAVE ALREADY COME

02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:54.371
BEFORE THEM -- SO THE MONEY IN

02:31:54.438 --> 02:31:56.740
SOME CASES IS INTENDED TO HELP

02:31:56.807 --> 02:32:00.744
EITHER EXPEDITE OR DO SOME WORK

02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:02.980
IN ADVANCE OF THAT CONVERSATION

02:32:03.047 --> 02:32:04.582
I THINK THAT -- IT DOESN'T

02:32:04.648 --> 02:32:09.086
PRECLUDE US COMING AND IN FUTURE --

02:32:09.153 --> 02:32:10.754
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE

02:32:10.821 --> 02:32:11.322
IN THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT

02:32:11.388 --> 02:32:12.890
WHETHER OR NOT COUNTIES WILL

02:32:12.957 --> 02:32:14.558
NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN THIS

02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:15.793
AREA TO EFFECTUATE THE WHOLE

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:17.294
PERSON CARE BUT I THINK JUST FOR

02:32:17.361 --> 02:32:18.662
PURPOSES OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:20.731
REVISION -- THIS MONEY IS

02:32:20.798 --> 02:32:22.399
INTENDED TO WORK WITH SOME OF

02:32:22.466 --> 02:32:24.134
THE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE

02:32:24.201 --> 02:32:26.003
NOT HAD A WHOLE PERSON CARE

02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:27.538
PILOTS OF ALL RIGHT SO THE WHOLE

02:32:27.605 --> 02:32:29.006
PERSON CARE PILOTS OF REALLY

02:32:29.073 --> 02:32:30.908
TRADITIONALLY BEEN -- COVERING A

02:32:30.975 --> 02:32:32.276
LOT OF THE MORE URBAN AREAS OF

02:32:32.343 --> 02:32:33.744
THE STATE AND SO THIS IS REALLY

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:35.613
INTENDED TO TRY TO WORK WITH

02:32:35.679 --> 02:32:37.047
COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT HAD ANY

02:32:37.114 --> 02:32:40.684
TRADITIONAL -- INVOLVED ARE

02:32:40.751 --> 02:32:41.185
ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVERS.

02:32:41.252 --> 02:32:42.620
OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:44.922
THINK -- OFTENTIMES THE THE THE

02:32:44.989 --> 02:32:46.490
RURAL COUNTIES THAT THE DON'T

02:32:46.557 --> 02:32:48.225
PARTICIPATE ONE OF THE THINGS IS

02:32:48.292 --> 02:32:48.859
LACKING OBVIOUSLY IS TECHNICAL

02:32:48.926 --> 02:32:49.627
ASSISTANCE.

02:32:49.693 --> 02:32:50.928
AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD

02:32:50.995 --> 02:32:53.297
FOR THEM TO TO TO PARTICIPATE

02:32:53.364 --> 02:32:55.299
BUT ALSO I HOPE THAT DID THE

02:32:55.366 --> 02:32:56.400
ADMINISTRATION IN GENERAL --

02:32:56.467 --> 02:32:58.068
CONSIDERS THE THE PLEA FOR

02:32:58.135 --> 02:33:00.070
FLEXIBILITY -- EVERY EVERY

02:33:00.137 --> 02:33:01.972
COUNTY IS NOT CREATED EQUAL AND

02:33:02.039 --> 02:33:03.574
THE CHALLENGES WITH INDIVIDUAL

02:33:03.641 --> 02:33:05.109
COUNTIES ARE ARE A CAN BE

02:33:05.175 --> 02:33:05.976
SIGNIFICANT.

02:33:06.043 --> 02:33:07.211
AND THAT MAY BE INDEED ONE OF

02:33:07.278 --> 02:33:08.579
THE REASONS THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEN

02:33:08.646 --> 02:33:10.347
SOME THE PARTICIPATION.

02:33:10.414 --> 02:33:12.249
OF BYE BYE BYE RURAL COUNTIES IS

02:33:12.316 --> 02:33:13.617
A FEAR THAT THERE ISN'T THAT

02:33:13.684 --> 02:33:15.486
GOING TO BE THAT FLEXIBILITY AND

02:33:15.553 --> 02:33:16.921
WHAT'S BEING OFFERED MAY NOT MAY

02:33:16.987 --> 02:33:19.757
NOT FIT WITH WITH WITH.

02:33:19.823 --> 02:33:21.158
WITH THEIR COUNTIES OPERATE SO

02:33:21.225 --> 02:33:26.497
RIGID THAT MEANING ONE OF OUR

02:33:26.564 --> 02:33:27.932
TWO FAVORITE COUNTIES ARE.

02:33:27.998 --> 02:33:28.632
THAT AND SAID BENITO ARE IN

02:33:28.699 --> 02:33:30.167
WHOLE PERSON CARE TOGETHER --

02:33:30.234 --> 02:33:30.834
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT

02:33:30.901 --> 02:33:31.902
CONTIGUOUS TO EACH OTHER SO THEY

02:33:31.969 --> 02:33:32.503
HAVE FIGURED IT OUT AND WE'RE

02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:33.103
VERY PROUD OF THAT AND SO I

02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:35.706
THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO

02:33:35.773 --> 02:33:36.941
IS HELP SUPPORT OTHER COUNTIES.

02:33:37.007 --> 02:33:39.076

SO THEY'VE BEEN OPERATE ON A

02:34:24.188 --> 02:34:25.522
MORE LIMITED BASIS AND THIS

02:34:25.589 --> 02:34:27.224

02:35:24.748 --> 02:35:26.116
CERTAIN THAT SOME ASPECTS OF THE

02:35:26.183 --> 02:35:27.918
WARM LINE COULD BE DUPLICATIVE

02:35:27.985 --> 02:35:29.353
WE DO HAVE CURRENT SYSTEMS OF

02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:30.821

02:35:53.143 --> 02:35:54.478
PLATFORMS SO WE THINK THAT

02:35:55.679 --> 02:35:57.681

FOR PROGRAMMING -- I THINK

02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:04.461
YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY THE

02:45:04.527 --> 02:45:05.495
ADVOCATES HERE THAT THEY WISH

02:45:05.562 --> 02:45:06.630
THAT THERE WAS A PLANNING

02:45:06.696 --> 02:45:07.931
PROCESS IN PLACE.

02:45:07.998 --> 02:45:09.132
I KNOW THERE WERE LEGISLATIVE

02:45:09.199 --> 02:45:11.201
PROPOSALS -- RECENTLY AS A YEAR

02:45:11.268 --> 02:45:12.702
OR TWO AGO ASKING THAT WE

02:45:12.769 --> 02:45:14.537
ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER WORKING

02:45:14.604 --> 02:45:15.939
GROUP'S TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT HOW

02:45:16.006 --> 02:45:17.440
WE HOW THIS IS SPENT THOSE PROP

02:45:17.507 --> 02:45:19.209
THOSE DIDN'T MAKE IT -- FOR

02:45:19.276 --> 02:45:20.543
VARIETY OF FOR A VARIETY OF

02:45:20.610 --> 02:45:22.746
REASONS SO -- YOU TALKED ABOUT

02:45:22.812 --> 02:45:26.049
COMPETITIVE GRANTS -- SO HOW

02:45:26.116 --> 02:45:28.118
DOES THAT WORK -- HOW DO YOU

02:45:28.184 --> 02:45:30.820
ENVISION THAT WORKING ONCE AGAIN --

02:45:30.887 --> 02:45:33.023
RURAL AREAS -- HAVE A HARD TIME

02:45:33.089 --> 02:45:34.090
COMPETING WITH LARGER URBAN

02:45:34.157 --> 02:45:35.925
AREAS AND I WOULD ARGUE -- BASED

02:45:35.992 --> 02:45:37.827
ON JUST MY DISTRICT THOSE

02:45:37.894 --> 02:45:39.396
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST

02:45:39.462 --> 02:45:42.365
AFFECTED BY -- CANNABIS AND

02:45:42.432 --> 02:45:43.967
CANNABIS CULTIVATION THROUGHOUT

02:45:44.034 --> 02:45:45.402
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTRAL

02:45:45.468 --> 02:45:48.438
CALIFORNIA -- ARE.

02:45:48.505 --> 02:45:50.273
I I THINK AT A HAVE HAVE A AT A

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:51.341
HIGHER RISK OF HAD HIGHER

02:45:51.408 --> 02:45:52.676
PROBLEMS THERE.

02:45:52.742 --> 02:45:55.211
SO HOW DO YOU ENVISION -- AWAY

02:45:55.278 --> 02:45:57.047
THAT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:45:57.113 --> 02:45:58.548
SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:45:58.615 --> 02:46:00.917
WERE MOST AFFECTED. TO ACTUALLY

02:46:00.984 --> 02:46:02.385
BECAUSE IT IS IN IN THE CAR IN

02:46:02.452 --> 02:46:04.821
THE WORLD COMPETITION --

02:46:04.888 --> 02:46:06.156
OFTENTIMES THOSE COMMUNITIES CAN

02:46:06.222 --> 02:46:07.757
UNITIES LOOSE AND THAT WAS I

02:46:07.824 --> 02:46:09.059
DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS THE

02:46:09.125 --> 02:46:10.260
INTENT OF PROP.

02:46:10.327 --> 02:46:11.261
SIXTY FOUR YEAH SO THOSE ARE

02:46:11.328 --> 02:46:12.696
GREAT QUESTIONS I THINK YOU KNOW

02:46:12.762 --> 02:46:15.198
A COUPLE OF RESPONSES -- THE

02:46:15.265 --> 02:46:17.467
FIRST IS THAT THE THE GRANTS

02:46:17.534 --> 02:46:18.568
NEED TO BE INFORMED BY THE

02:46:18.635 --> 02:46:20.003
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT THE

02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:21.438
INITIATIVE CONTEMPLATES SO WILL

02:46:21.504 --> 02:46:23.273
BE CONVENING THAT IN TERMS OF

02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:25.842
PROVIDING INPUT TO US ON YOU

02:46:25.909 --> 02:46:27.577
KNOW EITHER PRIORITY -- AREAS TO

02:46:27.644 --> 02:46:30.513
FOCUS ON A PRIORITY ACTIVITIES

02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:33.149
THE THE TEAM THAT WILL BE

02:46:33.216 --> 02:46:34.417
LEADING THIS WORK WITHIN THE

02:46:34.484 --> 02:46:35.785
DEPARTMENT ARE ALSO THE ONES

02:46:35.852 --> 02:46:37.287
THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING

02:46:37.354 --> 02:46:38.421
EXTENSIVELY ON THAT -- FEELING

02:46:38.488 --> 02:46:40.824
GRANT -- ACTIVITIES AND I KNOW

02:46:40.890 --> 02:46:42.726
THAT WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME --

02:46:42.792 --> 02:46:44.094
IN CERTAIN PARTS OF YOUR

02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:45.829
DISTRICT AS WELL AS OTHER PARTS

02:46:45.895 --> 02:46:47.530
OF THE STATE IN WHICH THERE ARE

02:46:47.597 --> 02:46:48.164
NOT.

02:46:48.231 --> 02:46:49.833
THE SAME KIND OF RESOURCES AND

02:46:49.899 --> 02:46:52.302
CAPACITY -- AND SO WE'VE SPENT A

02:46:52.369 --> 02:46:54.637
FAIR AMOUNT OF FEDERAL MONEY ON

02:46:54.704 --> 02:46:55.805
THE ON THE OPIOID SIDE IN

02:46:55.872 --> 02:47:01.044
PARTICULAR ABOUT BUILDING

02:47:01.111 --> 02:47:01.578
CAPACITY IN AREAS IN WHICH

02:47:01.644 --> 02:47:02.345
THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY.

02:47:02.412 --> 02:47:02.979
EITHER PROVIDERS ARE PROGRAMS I

02:47:03.046 --> 02:47:03.813
THINK THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY

02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:04.914
IS -- IT'S NOT OUR INTEREST TO

02:47:04.981 --> 02:47:08.418
DO AN OVERLY -- BUREAUCRATIC

02:47:08.485 --> 02:47:09.886
GRANT PROCESS JUST BECAUSE I'VE

02:47:09.953 --> 02:47:11.755
CERTAINLY HEARD -- THROUGH THE

02:47:11.821 --> 02:47:13.690
CHAFF AND OTHER TYPES OF GRANTS

02:47:13.757 --> 02:47:15.759
WHERE PEOPLE WILL SAY I I'D LIKE

02:47:15.825 --> 02:47:16.693
THE MONEY BUT I DON'T HAVE THE

02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:17.994
INTERNAL CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY

02:47:18.061 --> 02:47:19.329
WRITE THE GRANT AND I THINK THAT

02:47:19.396 --> 02:47:21.264
THAT'S NOT OUR INTEREST IN.

02:47:21.331 --> 02:47:22.799
IN THAT IT'S YOU KNOW.

02:47:22.866 --> 02:47:24.067
IT'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:47:24.134 --> 02:47:24.968
FOR THIS FIRST YEAR

02:47:25.034 --> 02:47:26.669
APPROPRIATION AND SO I THINK WE

02:47:26.736 --> 02:47:28.772
WANT -- TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS

02:47:28.838 --> 02:47:31.174
POSSIBLE FOR APPLICANTS TO BOTH

02:47:31.241 --> 02:47:32.976
APPLY AND USE THE MONEY IN A WAY

02:47:33.042 --> 02:47:34.644
THAT IS YOU KNOW AGAIN AND FROM

02:47:34.711 --> 02:47:36.212
BY THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SO.

02:47:36.279 --> 02:47:37.781
I'M HOPING THAT THAT YOU KNOW

02:47:37.847 --> 02:47:40.049
WHAT WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY --

02:47:40.116 --> 02:47:42.585
WILLING TO HAVE -- INCLUSION OF

02:47:42.652 --> 02:47:44.387
LEDGE STAFF AS APPROPRIATE OR

02:47:44.454 --> 02:47:46.723
POLICY STAFF -- SIT THROUGH THE

02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:47.590
SIT THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER

02:47:47.657 --> 02:47:49.259
PROCESS TO HELP ALSO INFORMS

02:47:49.325 --> 02:47:50.226
THEM THAT DECISION MAKING

02:47:50.293 --> 02:47:51.261
BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS

02:47:51.327 --> 02:47:52.262
JUST HAVEN'T HAVEN'T BEEN MADE

02:47:52.328 --> 02:47:52.796
YET.

02:47:52.862 --> 02:47:54.197
SO WITH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

02:47:54.264 --> 02:47:56.166
HAPPEN BEFORE THE AWARDING OF

02:47:56.232 --> 02:47:57.600
GRANTS YES YES.

02:47:57.667 --> 02:48:00.970
OKAY -- THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

02:48:01.037 --> 02:48:02.639
ENCOURAGING -- AS WELL I GUESS I

02:48:02.705 --> 02:48:05.842
I WORRY THAT -- TWENTY ONE POINT

02:48:05.909 --> 02:48:06.443
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT A

02:48:06.509 --> 02:48:08.211
HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT WOULD BE

02:48:08.278 --> 02:48:09.746
EASY TO GIVE EVERYBODY A LITTLE.

02:48:09.813 --> 02:48:11.881
AND ACCOMPLISH NOTHING AND SO IT

02:48:11.948 --> 02:48:13.149
WOULD BE I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE

02:48:13.216 --> 02:48:16.152
BE A FOCUS ON COMMUNITIES THAT --

02:48:16.219 --> 02:48:18.154
HAVE BEEN MOST AFFECTED GIVE

02:48:18.221 --> 02:48:19.522
THEM THE BEST OPPORTUNITY THERE

02:48:19.589 --> 02:48:21.491
RECOGNIZING THAT OVER TIME WE'RE

02:48:21.558 --> 02:48:22.459
GOING TO HAVE MORE AND MORE AND

02:48:22.525 --> 02:48:25.061
MORE MONEY COMING HERE BUT I

02:48:25.128 --> 02:48:25.795
THINK.

02:48:25.862 --> 02:48:27.464
I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE

02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:28.331
ONE OF ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS

02:48:28.398 --> 02:48:30.366
AND ALSO JUST THE THE CHALLENGE

02:48:30.433 --> 02:48:30.800
THAT.

02:48:30.867 --> 02:48:31.835
YOU KNOW SOME COMMUNITIES JUST

02:48:31.901 --> 02:48:33.236
HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THESE WITH

02:48:33.303 --> 02:48:34.637
GRANT PROCESSES SO I'M

02:48:34.704 --> 02:48:36.206
ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT THAT

02:48:36.272 --> 02:48:36.773
YOU'RE NOT TRYING WE'RE NOT

02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:37.006
TRYING.

02:48:37.073 --> 02:48:40.376
THIS OVER THE OVER THE

02:48:40.443 --> 02:48:41.711
BURDENSOME.

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:43.713
SO -- AND THEN ALSO THERE WAS IN

02:48:43.780 --> 02:48:45.448
HERE AND AND THERE'S ALSO FIVE

02:48:45.515 --> 02:48:46.049
POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS A
