PEERS ARE AMONG THE LOWEST COST HIGHEST IMPACT EMPLOYEES THAT WE CAN HAVE AN OR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND JUST AS IF AS WE'VE RECOGNIZED THE RANGE OF CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN ADDRESSING OUR WORKFORCE ISSUES. THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE STATE'S STRATEGY TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN PLACE IN THE RIGHT TIMES. WHO CAN DELIVER CARE IN A VERY COST EFFECTIVE MANNER? THE STATE ALSO HAS BEEN INVESTING. TO OUR S. P. EIGHTY TO TRIAGE DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO COUNTIES TO ACTUALLY PUT TEARS IN PLACE IN HOSPITALS. IN OUR TO TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE E. R. UTILIZATION IN OUR JAILS TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE INCARCERATIONS WE'RE ALSO USING PEERS AS PART OF OUR UTREACH STRATEGY.

ARE TO PROVIDE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES TO YOUTH AGE -- TWELVE TO TWENTY FIVE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MERGING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE DIFFICULTY. FINDING TIMELY APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. IN A SERVICE SYSTEM THAT CAN RESPOND -- JUST -- AS AN EVIDENCE -- THE RAPID RISE IN SUICIDES AMONG USE -- IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THE LACK OF SERVICES. TWO THIRDS OF ADOLESCENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE F. HAVE OF EPISODES DID NOT GET TREATMENT AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES. ARE EVEN LESS LIKELY -- BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION SERVICES YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN DO RIGHT REACH OUR HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICE OR JUSTICE SYSTEMS. INTEL THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS HAVE BECOME MORE SEVERE. AND OFTEN MORE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO TO TO TREAT. THIS BILL A APPROACHES YOUTH WELLNESS IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND YOU FRIENDLY WAY. LET LED BY MEMBERS OF AN ACTIVE USE ADVISORY GROUP TO DESIGN THE SERVICES. ENVIRONMENT THEY MOST WANT TO SEE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. NOW THE OP MISTER CHAIRMAN THE OPERATIONAL COST OF SANDERS -- WE ESTABLISH THIS -- BY THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- PILOT MODEL. AND IT'S APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR INCLUDING RENDON FELT STILL THE RENOVATION COSTS. AND IN COMMUNITIES WITH LOWER REAL ESTATE VALUES IN. SILICON VALLEY WHICH IS PROBABLY YOUR HIGHEST IN. YOU CAN PROCESS POSSIBLY FIND IN THE WORLD -- THE OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR THE CENTERS PROBABLY WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER MISTER CHAIRMAN. SINCE THE INITIATION THIS PROJECT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THERE'S BEEN A HIGH. FILL AND TROPIC -- INTEREST IN THE PRIVATE SET FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE INTEREST IS UNIVERSAL REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE CENTERS ARE LOCATED -- WE HAVE A STANFORD SEC SCHOOL OF PSYCHIATRY. PARTNERING WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. TO SUPPORTS. THE CENTER ALSO BENEFITS. IN FORM OF IN KIND SUPPORT. FROM OTHER PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING LUCILLE PACKARD CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL -- WE HAVE OUR CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL SUPPORTING [inaudible] THIS PROGRAM.

RESEARCHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M STEVE THAT'LL TIME I'M GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY I'M A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST BY TRAINING IN THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND THE STANFORD DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY -- WE'RE REALLY PLEASED TO BE -- BRINGING THIS EFFORT TO TODAY WE ARE VERY CONCERNED AFTER I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR MANY YEARS IN SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH AND IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS WORK. THAT THERE'S BEEN A REAL GAP IN TERMS OF EARLY INTERVENTION ACCESS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES AND WITH THIS BILL AND WITH THIS EFFORT CALIFORNIANS REALLY TAKING THE LEAD. IN DEVELOPING THESE ONE STOP SHOP MODELS THAT LINK EARLY MENTAL HEALTH CARE WITH PRIMARY CARE SUPPORT EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT. PEER SUPPORT AND OTHER EARLY INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE THAT ACCESS TO SERVICE AS A RESULT WE AND END UP IN CHEN BRING HUGE COSTS WHEN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND UP IN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE PEOPLE HAVE ON RECOGNIZED AN UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT ARE ON THE COST BEING BORNE BY THE STATE. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE END UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS FOR DRUG OVERDOSES SUICIDE ATTEMPTS ANOTHER SERIOUS MEDICAL ISSUES. THE HOPE FOR THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS TO BE ABLE -- TO ADDRESS THOSE CAUSED BY CREATING EARLY ACCESS POINTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO COME IN VERY EARLY TO GET EARLY MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT ENVIRONMENT. THAT IS YOUTH DRIVEN AND YOUTH FRIENDLY TO ENABLE THIS EARLY INTERVENTION TO TAKE PLACE IN A WAY THAT IT DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAPPEN. AT THIS POINT AT ALL AS YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN OTHER COUNTRIES DEVELOP THIS MODEL -- THEY CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SITES BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN THE COST BENEFIT OF THESE SERVICES THROUGH MORE YOUNG PEOPLE. STAYING IN SCHOOL NOT DROPPING OUT BECOMING -- EMPLOYABLE IN SUCCESSFUL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY RATHER THAN SPENDING MORE TIME INCARCERATED OR ANOTHER KINDS OF SYSTEMS. SO AS A RESULT WE'VE SEEN THIS MODEL GROWING -- STRICTLY AND NOW WITH A HUNDRED AND TEN OF THESE SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE GROWING ACROSS CANADA IRELAND -- OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD REALLY BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF BUILDING THESE EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS ARE HOPE WOULD BE. THAT WITH THESE SERVICES BEING DEVELOPED WE WILL HAVE AN EARLY PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO STAY IN SCHOOL BE SUCCESSFUL AND BECOME. AND REMAIN PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THANK YOU. TWENTY MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST W. IN WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. WOULD ECHO WHAT DOCTOR AT ALL TIME HAS TO SAY -- YOU KNOW IN IN MY TENURE IN STATE GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW OFTEN HAVE BEEN ASKED. HOW WE SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT COSTS AND AND AND WHERE ARE THEIR WAY SO WE CAN IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DOLLARS? ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS PART OF OUR LARGEST COST DRIVERS ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO SERVE. AS A RESULT OF THAT PEOPLE ARE BOUNCING BETWEEN SERVICES THEY'RE STARTING CARE THEY'RE ENDING THEIR LEAVING CARE. THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY DESIGNED TO START WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND ASK THEM HOW CAN WE DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY TAILORED TO YOUR NEEDS. AND DO IT SO IN A WAY THAT LINKS CARE ACROSS HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE. WITH STRONG LINKAGES TO SOCIAL EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYMENT HOUSING SUPPORTS THIS REALLY IS AN EX VERY EXCITING MODEL AGAIN BASED ON FOUR OFF OF WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE AROUND THE WORLD WE VISITED PROGRAMS IN CANADA WE'VE BROUGHT THOSE FOLKS TO CALIFORNIA THERE'S TREMENDOUS AND AN INTEREST IN THIS MODEL. THE COMMISSION IS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BECAUSE WE SEE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO INCENTIVIZE THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTIES WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE SERVICE SILOS. THAT OFTEN GET IN THE WAY OF DESIGNING CARE AROUND PEOPLE'S NEEDS WITH THE INTENT OF BEING ABLE TO DELIVER CARE EARLY. IN AN INTEGRATED AND TAILORED FASHION THAT AS DOCTOR IT'LL TIME POINTS OUT IS INTENDED TO REDUCE THOSE THE COST OF THOSE BAD OUTCOMES THAT THAT OUR SCHOOL FAILURE THAT OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE ORCORRECTIONS IN. INCREMENTS OF INVESTOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. AND AGAIN I WOULD HIGHLIGHT EMPLOYMENT. THE COMMISSION IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AS A STRATEGY TO REALLY THINK HOLISTICALLY AROUND THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND I WOULD SAY EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY TO BEGIN TO DESIGN CARE BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY IN WAYS THAT ARE COST EFFECTIVE SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

IN BURDENS OUR STATE WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HEALTHCARE COSTS RELATED TO THE TREATMENT OF THESE PREVENTABLE CHRONIC DISEASES. OVER THE LAST DECADE AN AVALANCHE OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH HAS DEFINITIVELY CONCLUDED THAT THE MAIN DRIVER BEHIND THE GROWTH OF THESE PREVENTABLE HEALTH CONDITIONS IN CHILDREN. IS THE INCREASED CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY SEVEN WILL EMPOWER CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE BEVERAGES THEY PURCHASE. BY REQUIRING A SCIENCE BASED HEALTH WARNING LABEL TO BE PLACED ON SUGARY DRINKS THAT ARE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA.

AT SOME TIME THESE RESTAURANTS OR THESE VENDING MACHINES OR WHATEVER THIS IS A GOOD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NECESSARY WARNING IS AND THERE WON'T BE ANY VIOLATIONS SO I'D LIKE TO SEE AN ANALYSIS THAT GIVES ME. A THREE YEAR PERIOD A FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO I KNOW WHAT THIS IS BECAUSE IT SEEMS RIDICULOUS THAT NOBODY WOULD DO ANYTHING IN THIS ONE PERSON THE STATE CALIFORNIA LEGAL RUNNING AROUND CITING FOLKS AT FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS. A POP [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER MONEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TRANSFERRED FROM. BOTH SIDES THIS MORNING QUICK COMMENT ON THE CONCERNS OF THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION -- WE DID ESTABLISH A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP ON THE CHILDREN'S MENU -- I BELIEVE THERE'S A PATHWAY TO MINIMIZING THE IMPACT ON RETAILERS -- FAST FOOD RESTAURANT YOU PUT THE LABEL ONCE ON THE VENDING. MACHINE AND YOU'VE SATISFIED YOUR OBLIGATION A SIMILARLY WITH THE MENU WE THINK THE REAL TRANSFORMATIONAL BE AT THE MANUFACTURE LEVEL WHERE. ALREADY INFORMATION IS PRINTED ON CANS AND BOTTLES THIS IS WHAT WILL GIVE PARENTS INFORMS CHOICE. IN JUST A FINAL COMMENT THERE'S BEEN SOME RECENT MEDIA REPORTS THAT CONSUMPTION OF SODAS HAS IN FACT GONE DOWN DO WE REALLY NEED THIS. THE ANSWER IS YES CERTAIN SODUS PEPSI COKE. BUYING IS GONE DOWN THOSE MANUFACTURERS HAVE DIVERSIFIED THEIR PRODUCTS TO THEIR CREDIT SOME WITH LOW CALORIE LOW SUGAR. OTHERS WHAT WE CALL CAMOUFLAGE STRING SPORTS TEAMS -- ENERGY DRINKS LOADED WITH SUGAR ON SCHOOL SITES WERE SO THIS AREN'T AVAILABLE BUT NOW THESE WE CALL THEM CAMOUFLAGED -- LOADED WITH SUGAR THEY ALSO POINT OUT THEIR SUGAR AND OTHER PRODUCTS WHY DO WE PICK ON SO IT IS. IT'S NOT WE AS POLITICIANS IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY IT IS CONCLUDED THAT FOR CHILDREN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THE LEADING SOURCE OF BAD CALORIC INTAKE. IS SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES ARE THREE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SAN BENITO MONTEREY COUNTY. AND SANTA CRUZ COUNTY CONDUCTED A SURVEY TWO YEARS AGO THEY FOUND OVER 50% OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS SURVEYED. HAD NOT HAD A GLASS OF WATER IN THE PRIOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT HAD HAD A SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE. SO IT'S SCIENCE AND MEDICINE TELLING US THAT THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC WE REALIZE THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION. BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE UNIFIED PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THIS MORNING. AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD HOPEFULLY TEACHER SUPPORT IN MOVING THIS OFF SUSPENSE FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS RUNNING -- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND PASSION WITHOUT OBJECTIONS SB THREE FOUR SEVEN WE'LL GO TO SUSPENSE.

EIGHT TO PASS RECOMMENDATION. BUT TO CALL THIS THE PORTANTINO WILL BILL [inaudible] FIVE ANYWAY ME STRUCTURE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB FIFTY THREE WHICH FXES A LOOPHOLE IN THE BAGLEY KEENE OPEN MEETINGS ACT. TWO TO ENSURE COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FROM STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS STATE AGENCIES BOARDS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL BODIES TO FORM ADVISORY SUBCOMMITTEES. THEY DO NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE OPEN MEETING REQUIREMENTS SO LONG AS THEY ONLY HAVE TWO MEMBERS THE SICK COMMITTEES ARE CAPABLE OF BUILDING SIGNIFICANT. POWER AND INFLUENCE BUT ARE ABLE TO CLOSE TO MEETINGS UP TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE OF A TECHNICALITY IN THE CURRENT LAW. WHAT THIS BILL DOES JUST TAKE THE PROFESSION THAT WAS PASSED IN? NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN THE ROUGH AND BROWN ACT THAT WEEK A CAB COMPEL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO. AND PUT THAT SAME PROVISION IN SO WE TREAT OUR STATE AGENCIES. AS FAIRLY AS WE TREAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO THE INFORMATION THIS BILL MAY IMPOSE MINOR TO MODERATE COST FOR CERTAIN STATE ENTITIES. BUT THOSE STATE AGENCIES AGENCIES SHOULD ONLY BE AFFECTED IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY EXPLOITING THE LOOPHOLE IN EXISTING LAW. SO SB FIFTY THREE WASHER OPEN AND ACCOUNTABLE STATE GOVERNMENT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. DO YOU HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WE FOUND OUT A FIVE PM ON FRIDAY THAT WE ARE DOING THIS BILL SO NOW. OKAY IS THERE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE ONE NO. OPPOSITION. SORT OF I HAVEN'T BEEN STAFFING THIS BILL SO -- I JUST TOOK OVER FOR THE PERSON WHO'S ON LEAVE -- I UNDERSTAND WE HAD SOME CONCERNS WE TALKED ABOUT IT OF THE ADVISORY BOARD AS FAR AS I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE DECISION MAKING POWERS WERE AFRAID THAT THIS MIGHT RESULT IN GOVERNMENT WASTE -- BY HAVING TO HAVE OPEN MEETINGS AND SCHEDULED MEETINGS JUST TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE DECISIONS ON SO I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE -- SOME MEMBERS ON OUR BOARD LIKE THE IDEA OF MAKING MORE TRANSPARENCY -- SO THE REASON WE'RE STILL IN OPPOSITION IS BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY SUPPORTED A PRIOR VERSION WHICH HAD MORE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE. WERE FREE THAT THE CURRENT VERSION MIGHT RESULT IN -- MIGHT BE TOO VAGUE AND SO WE ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE ADDED BACK IN FROM PRIOR BILLS -- SO FOR THAT REASON WERE IN OPPOSITION -- BUT WE CAN TALK WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHY. ONE SECOND YOU DID NOT IDENTIFY WEEK HI I AM SO SORRY -- MEDI HIGHER CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY. MR WORK WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND -- FIRST TIME I'M HEARING THIS -- FRANK THOMPSON IS SEPARATING THE BILL ON OUR STAFF SO -- PLEASE GET TOGETHER WITH HIM. THANK YOU SING NO THEIR OPPOSITION FINANCE NO FILE NO FILE ANY QUESTIONS. MR WHY COUNTY COURT -- THE OPPOSITION RAISES A GOOD POINT BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACTION THAT THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WHAT THE TRIGGER HERE IS JUST THE USE OF STATE FUNDS SO? WHAT OTHER I GUESS OCT TOP TYPE OF ACTIVITY WOULD REQUIRE WOULD KICK -- ECKLEY KILLEEN THIS IS NOT A WIDESPREAD PRACTICE BUT IT IS A PRACTICE THIS FIRST CAME. TO MY ATTENTION WITH SOMEBODY HE WANTED TO DEBT TO TO ATTEND A STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND THEY WENT TO THE COMMITTEE AND THEY WERE BARRED FROM THEY ARE BARRED FROM ENTERING IT. AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PUBLIC THE LARGEST PUBLIC -- PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND I THINK YOU DESERVE TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND AND TRANSPARENCY THERE'S A FEW OTHER AGENCIES TO DO THIS TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IT'S VERY FEW. AND SO I THINK MOST PEOPLE -- LE ALLOW OPENING OPENING IT UP I KNOW MY OWN COMMUNICATIONS TRICK THAT I WE USED TO BE ON THE BOARD OF THEY JUST GOT CITED FOR OUR BROWN ACT VIOLATION BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT THEY WERE BORING MEMBERS FROM THE PUBLIC. TO THE STANDING COULD TEST AND COMMITTEE NAY WERE CITED. BUT SO THAT WE HAVE THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT WE DON'T HAVE IT UP HERE. I GUESS MISTER CHAIR THE THE QUESTION IS IS THAT THAT COMMITTEE TAKES NO ACTION IT'S THE WHOLE COMMITTEE EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE BARRED FROM THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. IT'S THAT MATTER COMES BACK TO THE FULL BODY THAT BODY HAS AN OPEN TRANSPARENT HEARING THEY HEAR FROM THE VISOR COMMITTEE PERSON THEY COME IN WITH THE REPORT. THE PUBLIC. I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IS THE HARM TO THE PUBLIC IF THEY COME IN AT THAT TIME AND SAY WE DISAGREE WITH THAT -- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND NO SIR I CERTAINLY SACKED ACCESS TO INFORMATION RIGHT IF THEY'RE HAVING STANDING COMMITTEES AND THEY'RE HAVING A YEAH THEY'RE NOT TAKING BOTH WITH THEIR CERTAINLY HAVING DOES DISCUSSIONS. THE GETTING INPUT FROM STAFF AND AND OTHERS SO I I DON'T SEE THE HARM OF THE PUBLIC BEING FULLY INFORMED ON WHATEVER THE PARTICULAR ISSUE AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SCHEDULED MEETINGS SO OFTEN TIMES REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETINGS. AND AS YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES ADVISORY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS THEN BECOME PRO FORMA ACTIONS OF THE NEXT. BODY AND SO I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM AND THE COST IS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ESTIMATE. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT PER YEAR. SOMEBODY SAID THAT IN THIS REPORT. ON PAGE ONE OF LESS THAN. OKAY LESS THAN [inaudible] LAST. MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD JUST. GO AHEAD MR HELP ME IT JUST SEEMS THAT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE THOSE WHO WILL BE INFLUENCE IN HAT ADVISORY BOARD AND THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE THAT AND TO KNOW THAT GENTRAN TO A MOVIE HAVING TO MOVE.
