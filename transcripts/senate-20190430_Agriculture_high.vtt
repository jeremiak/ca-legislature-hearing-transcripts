THEN MOVE OFF OFF OF SO.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.280
CALIFORNIA HAS ITS OWN

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:09.915
INDUSTRIAL HEMP CLOSER GROWERS

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.850
ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW -- SO WE

INTERSTATE MOVEMENT OF HELP --

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:23.362

INDUSTRIAL HEMP LAW IN PLACING

IN CALIFORNIA FOR MANY YEARS NOW --

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.238
ZURICH ON ADMINISTERING OUR OWN

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:34.606
OUR OWN LAW AND CERTAINLY

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.275
WORKING WITH OUR COLLABORATES

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:38.544
RY -- TO DO WHAT WE CAN.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.546
TO HARMONIZE AND COLLABORATE

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:41.513
WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND

OUR GROWERS ARE ARE PROTECTED IN

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:48.353
AWARE OF THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.688
THAT MAY BE APPLIED TO THEM.

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.356
WELL I THAT THAT MAY ANSWER THE

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.058
QUESTION I GUESS I'M.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.259
WE'RE SETTING UP THIS BIG

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:56.361
FRAMEWORK THAT.

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:57.863
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT MAY MAYOR

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.665
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MARIJUANA

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:00.933
BUT HIM TO REALLY.

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:04.169
DIFFERENT PRODUCT AND AND SO I'M

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:05.404
I JUST WANNA.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.440
I WANT TO CAUTION US -- EITHER

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:10.309
IT'S AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:13.245
AND AND WE CAN SET UP -- SOME

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:16.114
FRAMEWORKS THAT DON'T REQUIRE

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:17.215
OVER REGULATION OR WEALTH OR

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:18.050
ELSE WE'LL WE'LL SET UP THIS

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.184
WHOLE FRAMEWORK WHERE YOU'VE GOT

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.653
TO GET A LICENSE TO DO ANYTHING

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.122
AND I JUST WORRY ABOUT THAT --

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.557
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT HEMP

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:27.626
IS DIFFERENT THAN MARIJUANA

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.361
CERTAINLY IT'S GOT -- SOME REAL

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:32.698
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS THAT MAY

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:36.335
ALLOW US -- TO USE IT IN WAYS

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:39.237
THAT.

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:41.273
WARRANT WARRANTY INITIALLY

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.241
DESIGNED FOR HIM RIGHT WE IT IF

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:45.377
IT USES LESS WATER HOW MUCH LESS

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:47.212
WATER IF IT -- IF IT CLEANS THE

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.880
SOIL -- IT MAY HAVE SOME

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:50.682
APPLICATION FOR AGRICULTURE IN

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:52.851
THAT REGARD AND IF IT CAN BE

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.553
MANUFACTURED INTO PRODUCTS THAT

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.256
ARE USEFUL AND THAT CAN REPLACE --

00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:00.092
PLASTICS FOR EXAMPLE THERE MAY

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:02.027
BE A HUGE MARKET FOR HEMP AND WE

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.096
WOULD BE IN A IN A PRETTY UNIQUE

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.130
POSITION IN THAT REGARD SO I

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.832
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:08.433
BEFORE WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD WERE

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.267
LICENSE ANY.

00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:11.403
LICENSING THE SEEDS LICENSING

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.771
THE PLANT LICENSING.

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:14.306
THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE GROWING

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:17.776
AT THAT WE LOOK AT WHAT.

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:19.011
A FRAMEWORK THAT GIVES US A

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:20.746
LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:22.481
THAN MARIJUANA AND MARIJUANA.

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:23.815
OBVIOUSLY IS A DIFFERENT IF IF

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:25.183
IT'S A DIFFERENT SUBJECT AND WE

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.152
WE NEED TO HAVE THAT LICENSING

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.887
BUT BUT I'M I'M JUST NOT SURE IN

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.322
IN THIS INSTANCE SO.

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:31.723
JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE YEAH IF

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.725
I COULD ADDRESS THAT -- THANK

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:35.193

HEMP IS IN FOOD ENACT CODE

00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:48.140
THEREFORE IT IS AN AGRICULTURAL

00:21:48.206 --> 00:21:49.875
COMMODITIES INDUSTRY DID SUCH

00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:51.476

THAT FOURTH GENERATION -- THE

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:06.524
WANTS TO STAY ON THE FORM.

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.126
BUT AGRICULTURE IS PROBABLY MANY

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:10.195
OF YOU KNOW IS GOES THROUGH SOME

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:13.064
REAL CYCLES IN HARD TIMES AND

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.499
PART OF THOSE TIMES ARE HITTING

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:16.735
NOW FOR SOME -- SECTIONS OF

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.169
AGRICULTURE.

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:20.271
AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ON

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:22.307
FARMING -- CHANGES NEED TO BE

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:23.208
MADE SOMETIMES IT'LL GET A

00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:24.409
LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT OUR

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.211
OWN PERSONAL SITUATION IN JUST A

00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:27.479
MOMENT.

00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:28.580
CURRENTLY WE HAVE THREE

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:29.981
GENERATIONS WORKING ON OUR

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:33.518
FAMILY FARM -- WE GROW ABOUT

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:34.152
FIFTEEN HUNDRED ACRES OF ALFALFA

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:36.221
UNDER -- PIVOT IRRIGATION AND

00:27:36.287 --> 00:27:38.256
ALSO RUN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED BEEF

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:40.325
CATTLE ON OUR ON OUR OPERATION

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:42.060
IN OUR OPERATION START NINETEEN

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:43.328
TWENTY TWO WITH MY GRANDPARENTS.

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:44.229
AND IT'S BEEN OUR FAMILY EVER

00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:46.664
SINCE AND IS COMPLETELY FAMILY

00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:50.769
OWNED AND OPERATED -- WE LIVE --

00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:52.370
HANG IN A LITTLE BIT OF SOME

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:54.005
WHAT DO A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:55.473
CONSIDER BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY AND

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.842
YET -- IN IT IS BUT IT'S SOME

00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:59.144
PRETTY HARSH COUNTRY TOO SO WERE

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.845
UP IN THE IN THE SIERRAS JUST

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:02.347
NORTH THE TRUCKEE CALIFORNIA

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:03.882
ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILES AN

00:28:03.948 --> 00:28:05.383
ELEVATION OF FIVE THOUSAND FOOT --

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.752
BEAUTIFUL VALLEY -- BUT IT

00:28:07.819 --> 00:28:10.121
CREATES ITS OWN CHALLENGES IN

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:11.356
THAT -- BECAUSE OF OUR CLIMATE

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:14.025
AND VERY SHORT GROWING SEASON

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:15.760
AND CALL COLD SEASON AND SO WE

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:17.662
CAN GET FROST ANY DAY OF THE

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:18.229
YEAR.

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:20.465
AND YES I'VE EVEN SEEN SNOW ON

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:22.233
THE FOURTH OF JULY -- BELIEVE IT

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.803
OR NOT -- LAST YEAR WE HAD MADE

00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:29.808
A DECISION OUR FAMILY -- TO

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:31.209
REALLY TAKE A BIG JUMP OF FAITH

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:34.412
AND OUT OF OUR COMFORT ZONE AND

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:34.913
TO US.

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:36.981
TRY PLANTING SOME HAMP -- THE

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:40.018
MAIN REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:41.319
OF OUR DECISION MAKING WAS

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:42.587
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:45.890
ALTERNATIVE CROP -- IN OUR

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:49.394
SITUATION GROWING OFF ALPHA. FOR

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:51.096
MOST OF OUR MARKET GOES TO

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:52.397
DERRY'S IN THE MODESTO TURLOCK

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:54.132
AREA AND IN DERRY MARKET IS

00:28:54.199 --> 00:28:56.067
REALLY BEEN HURTING LAST SUMMER

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:57.502
YEARS A LOT OF DAIRIES GOING OUT

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.137
OF BUSINESS.

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:01.873
pAFFECT OUR MARKET AT SOME POINT

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.142
TWO AND WE DECIDED IT'S TIME TO

00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:05.410
START LOOKING FOR ANOTHER

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:06.644
ALTERNATIVE.

00:29:06.711 --> 00:29:08.079
UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO OUR CLIMATE

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:09.881
AVOCADOS DON'T WORK TOMATOES

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:12.183
DON'T WORK ALMOST NOTHING CAN

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.018
STAND THE COLD WEATHER THAT WE

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:15.487
HAVE.

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:17.222
AND THEN WE RAN ACROSS HIM.

00:29:17.288 --> 00:29:19.791
AND THAT LAST YEAR WE DID PLANT

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:20.358
SOME.

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.627
UNDER THE PROGRAM WITH THE

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.262
UNIVERSITY IN ABOUT AT ARENA ON

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:26.865
DR -- GLENN MILLER WHO WAS THEY

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:28.333
WERE EXCITED ABOUT ONE

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:29.534
APPROACHING ABOUT DOING RESEARCH

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:30.902
FOR US.

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:33.738
BECAUSE NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:35.573
NORTHWESTERN NEVADA.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.342
HAVE VERY SIMILAR CLIMATE AND

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:37.542
DRY.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.177
LOW PRECIPITATION ON THE SIDE OF

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:41.112
THIS YEAR AS AND AND KIND OF

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:43.681
COLD COUNTRY AND SO HAVING --

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:45.416
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST FROM ABOUT

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:47.285
FORTY MINUTES FROM RENO AND HE

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:48.753
WAS EXCITED THAT HE COULD JUST

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.555
HAVE A SHORT DRIVE TO COME DO

00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:52.524
THE RESEARCH -- WITH HIS -- WITH

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.860
HIS STUDENTS -- SO WE LOOKED AT

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:58.363
HIM LAST YEAR WE DID PLAN SOME

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:00.765
AND I WOULD NOT CALL IT A

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:02.233
SUCCESS AT ALL.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.868
WE HAVE A WE LEARNED A LOT

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:06.804
THROUGH OUR FAILURES AND I THINK

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:07.438
THAT'S GONNA TAKE PLACE

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:09.407
THROUGHOUT -- WITH THE FARMERS

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:12.477
BECAUSE IT IS A NEW CROP -- BUT

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.245
THROUGH THAT LEARNING WE LEARNED

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:17.115
THAT IT IS POSSIBLE IN OUR AREA --

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:18.816
THAT HIM HANDLE TEMPERATURES

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:20.818
DOWN INTO THE MID TWENTIES.

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:22.253
IT DIDN'T LIKE THE EIGHTEEN

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.922
DEGREES FOR MORNINGS IN A ROW IN

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:25.390
THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER HAND

00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:27.225
SO THAT WE DECIDED IT'S TIME TO

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:28.159
HARVEST.

00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:30.261
AND THE HEAD OF IT -- TO BUT IT

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:32.230
DOES HANDLE THE COOLER WEATHER

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:33.198
AND SO.

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:35.400
I'M NOT CONVINCED YET THAT IT'S

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:37.235
GOING TO WORK FOR US.

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:40.205
BUT OF THE VERY VERY FEW CROPS

00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:42.173
THAT CAN GROW IN THERE I THINK

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.707
THIS IS A REALLY HAS THE

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:44.209
POTENTIAL.

00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:45.210
THE OTHER PART THAT REALLY

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:46.578
EXCITES ME IS THE POTENTIAL OF

00:30:46.644 --> 00:30:48.313
WHAT THIS CROP CAN DO AND I'M

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:49.113
NOT GONNA GET INTO ALL THE

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.348
DETAILS OF CENTER HERE WAS

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:52.250
TALKING ABOUT MAKING PLASTICS

00:30:52.317 --> 00:30:53.985
AND FIBER BOARDS AND EVERYTHING

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:56.754
BUT IT REALLY IS ENDLESS I THINK

00:30:56.821 --> 00:30:58.489
ALMOST WITH THIS PLANT CAN DO.

00:30:58.556 --> 00:30:59.757
A LOT OF THE HYSTERIA AND HYPE

00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:01.025
AND EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW IS ALL

00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:02.460
BASED AROUND CBT OILS AND

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:04.562
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT AND I

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:05.997
THINK THAT'S GREAT.

00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:06.664
BUT I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:08.333
LOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:10.201
START GETTING TO THE PROCESSING

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:11.336
OF THE FIBER AND THE USES THAT

00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:12.270
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE

00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:14.205
PLACE THERE I THINK THAT'S WHERE

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:15.607
THE REAL FUTURE IS GOING TO BE.

00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:17.775
OUR RESEARCH WITH THE UNIVERSITY

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:18.676
IN ABOUT AT ARENAL.

00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:20.578
BILL WITH A FIVE AREAS LAST YEAR

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:22.247
AND WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO

00:31:22.313 --> 00:31:23.748
CONTINUE OUR RESEARCH HOPEFULLY

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:26.217
FOR IF IF THINGS GROW ALL RIGHT

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:27.752
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THAT FOR

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:30.088
FIVE YEARS -- THIS WILL WE DID

00:31:30.154 --> 00:31:31.856
NOT GET INTO THE THIS RESEARCH

00:31:31.923 --> 00:31:34.058
JUST TO GIVE US A LICENSE SO TO

00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:35.260
SPEAK TO TO GROW HAMP WE REALLY

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:36.594
WANT TO DO THE RESEARCH AND SO

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:38.930
WE'VE GOT A IVE YEAR AGREEMENT

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:39.530
WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:41.165
RENO.

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:41.799
THE BIGONE WE WERE TO COME IN

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:42.367
THERE ALL BIG BUT THE WATER

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:43.601
CONSUMPTION IS A BIG ONE

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:45.136
ESPECIALLY FOR OUR AREA WE ARE

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:47.605
IN A MOTOR ITS OWN AS FAR AS OUR

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:49.607
OUR WATER BASIN HAD AND THE THE

00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:51.309
PROBLEMS YOU CAN HAVE THEIR WE

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:52.243
BELIEVE THAT THE WATER.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.312
CONSUMPTION WILL BE PROBABLY

00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:56.180
ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT ALFALFA

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:59.317
YES -- INSECT PREDATION -- WE

00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:01.286
DON'T KNOW NEW WEEVILS CROSSOVER

00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:04.389
FROM ALFALFA -- TO HAMPER AND SO

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:06.257
WERE WERE DIDN'T WERE STUDYING

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:07.091
THAT.

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:10.028
PLANT SPACING FOR OPTIMAL YIELD --

00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:11.329
THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION HOW

00:32:11.396 --> 00:32:13.364
FAR APART YOU NEED TO PUT THE

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:14.399
PLAN SIR TO THE YOU KNOW IF IF

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:16.067
THEY NEED TO GET ROOM TO GROW OR

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:18.403
DO THEY DO BETTER -- CLOSER

00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:19.704
TOGETHER.

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.406
PLANT VARIETIES TO TO FIT OUR

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:22.774
CLIMATE -- IT'S LIKE ANYTHING

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.709
ELSE -- YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:26.244
RIGHT VARIETIES TO HANDLE THAT

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:28.079
AND SO WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.

00:32:28.146 --> 00:32:32.383
AND THE OPTIMAL TIME TO HARVEST --

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.985
SO THAT REQUIRES TESTING.

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:35.687
EVERY FOUR FIVE DAYS ONCE YOU

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:36.721
GET TO MATURITY POINT SO WHAT IS

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.856
THE OPTIMAL TIME TO HARVEST --

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:41.259
AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF OF

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:50.001
THE CROPS BEST DEAL.

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:52.203
I THINK CAMPUS.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.272
HAS BECOME AN WILL BECOME THAT

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:57.275
CROP THAT HELPS US.

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:59.844
FIND THE VIABILITY FOR A LOT OF

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:01.312
FARMERS NOT JUST IN OUR AREA AND

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:02.580
THROUGHOUT NORTHEASTERN

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:03.514
CALIFORNIA BUT ALL THROUGHOUT

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:04.282
THE STATE.

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:05.917
THAT BY ABILITY TO STAY IN

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:09.654
BUSINESS.

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:10.188
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:11.222
IMPORTANT.

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:13.558
BECAUSE OF SO MANY SECTORS IN

00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:15.159
AGRICULTURE THAT ARE STRUGGLING.

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:19.364
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A TOMATO --

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.299
TRANSPLANT COMPANY.

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:23.101
AND TO SEE IF THEY CAN AND THEY

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.936
THINK THEY CAN TO SEE IF THEY

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:26.738
CAN MODIFY THEIR EQUIPMENT. TO

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:29.440
PLANT SEEDS OF HIM TO START THEM

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:30.641
PLANTS AND THEN ACTUALLY IT

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.710
TRANSPLANT THEM JUST LIKE DOING

00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:34.679
TOMATOES -- THERE ARE SOME

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:35.980
DIFFERENCES THERE THE SIZE OF

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.181
THE PLANTS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

00:33:37.248 --> 00:33:38.916
THAN A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:39.951
BUT IN TALKING WITH THIS

00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:41.552
GENTLEMAN IS A VISITOR AT OUR

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:43.521
PLACE -- LAST WEEK -- HE'S

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:46.257
EXCITED ABOUT GETTING INTO THIS

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:47.792
NEW VENTURE ALSO.

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.394
BECAUSE WHAT'S TAKING PLACE IN

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.962
AND TOMATO INDUSTRY THAT I

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:53.231
DIDN'T KNOW IS THEIR SCALING

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:54.065
BACK TO THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A

00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:55.767
HARD TIME HE LOST OVER A

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.068
THOUSAND ACRES THAT -- THAT THEY

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:59.437
PLANTED LAST YEAR AND SO HE'S

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:01.172
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:03.641
ABLE TO STRUCTURE HIS BUSINESS

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:06.344
TO TO HELP US OUT TO KEEP HIS

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:07.478
EMPLOYEES.

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:09.614
AND TO KEEP HIS BUSINESS GROWING.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.349
THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT --

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:13.217
AND CHALLENGES AHEAD BUT BEING A

00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:16.053
NEW CROP WE EXPECT THAT AND WE

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.056
FOUND THAT OUT LAST YEAR --

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:21.092
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO PLANT

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.361
USING SEEDS ARE USING CLONES --

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:24.962
WE'D AN INSECT CONTROL IS GOING

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:26.330
TO BE A BIG ONE BECAUSE THERE'S

00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:28.065
THERE'S NO REGISTER PESTICIDES

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.967
OR HERBICIDES AVAILABLE ON HIM

00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:32.236
YET -- AS WELL AS WELL AS THE

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:34.439
THE BEST WAY TO HARVEST THAT IS

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:35.373
ONE OF THE REAL QUESTIONS THAT

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.474
ARE STILL OUT THERE THERE'S A

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.176
LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS AND

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.911
MODIFICATIONS TO EQUIPMENT BUT

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:41.746
THERE IS NO ONE WAY YET -- OF TO

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:43.748
HARVESTING IN FACT A LOT OF IT

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:46.617
IS STILL DONE -- BY HAND AND

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:49.387
THAT'S WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR --

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:50.655
BUT THE FARMERS WILL FIGURE OUT

00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:51.722
A WAY.

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:52.990
I'VE GOT NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:54.358
THEY'RE PRETTY.

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:55.560
GOOD AT INVENTING THINGS AND

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:57.528
MODIFYING THINGS -- PROCESSING

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:59.697
PLANTS ARE LAGGING BEHIND A

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:01.265
LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S EXPECTED

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:02.467
BECAUSE I CAN EXPECT SOMEBODY GO

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:03.968
BUILD A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:05.470
PROCESSING PLANT BEFORE THIS

00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:06.204
PRODUCT.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.438
AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:09.373
CATCH -- TWENTY TWO AND SO NOW

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.676
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A THE

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:13.010
TIME LAG THERE TO GET THINGS

00:35:13.077 --> 00:35:14.712
PROCESS TO WHERE DO YOU GO WITH

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:16.047
IT -- BUT I THINK OVER THE NEXT

00:35:16.113 --> 00:35:17.915
COUPLE THREE YEARS THAT WILL ALL

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:19.484
GET EVENED OUT AND THE

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.986
PROCESSORS WILL COME -- BUT WITH

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:23.654
THE CHALLENGES ALSO COME.

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.357
WITH A NEW CROP -- ALSO COMES

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:28.159
OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:29.527
WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:30.428
LOOKING.

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:31.996
FORWARD.

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:37.335
AT WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE --

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:39.804
FOR US THE OPPORTUNITY IS.

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:42.340
HOPEFULLY PROVIDING A VIABLE WAY

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:43.474
FOR OUR OPERATION TO STAY IN

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:46.210
BUSINESS SO ARE FOR GENERATION

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:46.878
FIFTH GENERATION WHATEVER

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:49.947
FARMERS -- OR FAMILY CAN STAY ON

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:52.850
THAT LAND -- BECAUSE YOU BEGIN

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.519
TO WORRY ABOUT OKAY OF ALFALFA

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:56.287
MARKET GOES AWAY.

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:57.455
WHAT WE DO NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:35:57.522 --> 00:36:00.424
HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS? TO SELDOM

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:02.026
THAT A NEW CROP COMES ALONG.

00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:03.094
WITH THAT.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.297
CAN REALLY GET EXCITED ABOUT --

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:08.299
WHEN I WAS I WENT TO HIM

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:09.934
CONFERENCE BACK IN DENVER A FEW

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:10.468
WEEKS AGO?

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:12.270
AND THIS GUEST SPEAKER THERE WAS

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:13.504
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING HE

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:15.206
SAYS YOU KNOW THE LAST BIG CROP

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:17.508
THIS COUNTRY IS REALLY SEEN THAT

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:20.244
REALLY CHANGING THE SOYBEAN.

00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:21.913
AND I WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:23.614
I THINK HIM AND HE THOUGHT SO

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.316
TOO I THINK HIM HAS THE ABILITY

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:27.218
TO BE WAR WAY BIGGER THAN

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:28.786
SOLVING CROP -- WHAT WE CAN DO

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:31.389
WITH IT -- SO ANYWAY I'VE THANK

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.590
YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'LL ANSWER

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:33.758
ANY KIND OF QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.393
HAVE FOR ME AND IF -- WHEN WE

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:37.361
GET INTO THE SEASON IF SOMEBODY

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:38.195
WANTS TO COME TAKE A LITTLE TOUR

00:36:38.262 --> 00:36:40.598
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE INVITED TO

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:41.766
COME SEE OUR PLACE SOME?

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:43.434
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DID HAVE A

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:45.836
QUESTION -- IN TERMS OFTHE

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:48.372
WEATHER WHEN IT'S WHEN WE HAVE

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:49.941
LATE RAINS.

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:51.909
AND YOUR CROP GETS WET AND THEN

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:53.878
YOU HAVE THE SUN COMING AND IS

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.313
THERE A CHANCE FOR MORE THAN

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:56.914
WHAT DOES THAT DO TO YOUR CROP

00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:58.950
WHEN YOU HAVE LATE RAINS.

00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:02.320
YES -- MILDEW IS AB IT CAN BE A

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:07.091
BIG PROBLEM FOR HIM -- AND

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:07.992
PROBABLY OVERSTEPPED AMOUNT

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:09.293
OVERSTEPPING MY BOUNDS OF

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.897
KNOWLEDGE HERE BUT THE THERE

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:14.165
THERE'S A CONCEPT THAT HAMS

00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:16.300
GONNA JUST GROW ANYWHERE -- AND

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:17.635
I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:19.937
GOING TO BE THE CASE -- HIM DOES

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:21.105
NOT LIKE REALLY HOT WEATHER IT

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:22.707
JUST KIND OF SHUTS DOWN DOESN'T

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:25.109
GROW WE'RE WELL -- HIM DOESN'T

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:26.711
LIKE HIGH HUMIDITY.

00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:28.379
SO THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS OF

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:30.247
THE STATE THAT PROBABLY IS NOT

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:31.115
GOING TO WORK REAL WELL TO BE

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:32.316
GROWING HIM.

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:34.919
BUT THE ONE THING YOU DO WANT TO

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.454
TRY TO CONTROL IS THE HUMIDITY

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.055
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO GET SOME

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:40.591
RAINS AT THE WRONG TIME -- AND

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:42.059
IT COULD CAUSE YOU SOME PROBLEMS

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:43.361
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:45.329
HARVESTING IS IS GOING TO BE THE

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.130
REAL TRICK THERE SEVERAL

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:47.865
DIFFERENT WAYS NOW THAT THEY'RE

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:48.866
LOOKING A HARVESTING SOME OF

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:50.134
THEM CUT THE HAMPER AND THEN

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:51.636
LEAVE IT ON THE GROUND FOR FOUR

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:52.336
FIVE DAYS TO DRY.

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:53.971
AND THEN COME THROUGH WITH SOME

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:57.041
EQUIPMENT -- TRY THIS --

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.643
SEPARATE THE LEAVES IN THE BUGS

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:00.211
FROM THE STOCK AND STUFF.

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:01.746
THAT PUTS YOU KNOW DANGER ZONE

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:02.780
THOUGH AWHILE IT'S SITTING ON

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:04.181
THE GROUND TRYING TO DRY --

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:06.250
THERE'S OTHER -- METHODS COMING

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:07.918
ABOUT IT SEEMS LIKE THAT -- YOU

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:10.621
CAN CUT IT -- AND MEDIA THE

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.723
HOLLOW IN THE TELL PROCESSING

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.826
WILD GREEN EVEN SO -- ALL THAT'S

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:18.362
GOING TO COME WITH PEOPLE

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:20.031
FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO A BIT YES

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.832
MILDEW CAN BE A VERY BIG PROBLEM

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.034
FOR FOR HIM YES.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.568
AND WHAT ABOUT IF YOU HAVE A AN

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:30.374
EARLY FREEZE WHATEVER CROP

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.276
FREEZES.

00:38:32.343 --> 00:38:34.779
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET -- WHAT

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:36.313
IT WHAT OF MY ENTERED WHAT I'VE

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.848
STUDIES SO FAR IN RED IS HIM

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:39.417
EVEN AS A IS A A SEEDLINGPLANT

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:40.084
CAN HANDLE FROST PRETTY WELL --

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.152
WHATWE'RE GOING TO DO THIS YEAR

00:38:41.218 --> 00:38:44.989
BECAUSE WE CAN STILL GET FROST --

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.390
UP TO NOW THE END OF MAY AND

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:47.758
INTO THE FIRST PART OF JUNE WORK

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:48.492
FOR GONNA PLANTING ABOUT THE

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:50.995
FIRST OF JUNE -- WE ARE GOING TO

00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:53.831
PLANT -- IN IN ROSE BASICALLY

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:32.296
FOUR WEEKS OF GROWTH AND THEN

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:34.264
THEY'LL START TRANSPLANTING --

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:36.266
BUT WE DID TRY LAST YEAR SOME

00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:38.402
DIRECT SEEDING INTO THE FIELD --

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:41.905
AND IT WORKED OKAY -- AND SO I

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:43.841
THERE'S SOME TECHNOLOGY COMING

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:45.375
THAT'S JUST INCREDIBLE TO WHERE

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:48.312
THEY'RE TAKING TISSUE SAMPLES --

00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:49.847
CULTURES I'M SORRY -- FROM

00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:52.616
PLANTS -- TO WORDS.

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:54.985
AND AND IT'S JUST MICROSCOPIC

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:56.220
ALMOST AND THEY CAN CAPITALIZE

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.222
THEM AND THEN USE THAT AS YOUR

00:45:58.288 --> 00:46:00.124
SEED AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.924
GROW THOSE IN A HOT HOUSE AND

00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:02.593
YOU CAN PLAN OF DIRECT BUT AS OF

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:05.095
RIGHT NOW MOST OF THE CAMPUS

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:06.163
BEING PLANTED.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.764
AS AS STARTER PLANTS AND THEN

00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:08.799
BEING TRANSPLANTED.

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:12.269
SO IN THEORETICALLY -- AT SOME

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:14.505
POINT IF YOUR OPERATION IS IS

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:16.373
BIG ENOUGH YOU COULD ACTUALLY

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.509
REPRODUCE YOUR OWN PLANTS.

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:20.811
AND AND YOU COULD -- ONE OF THE

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:25.415
CHALLENGES IS GONNA COME IS --

00:46:25.482 --> 00:46:26.683
IF I'M TRYING TO GROW FOR

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.318
EXAMPLE IF I'M TRYING TO GROW

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:29.987
FOR CBD OIL.

00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:32.356
I WANT ALL FEMALE PLANTS I DON'T

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:33.724
WANNA POLLINATE ANY PLACE I

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:34.625
DON'T WANT SEATS ON A WINNING

00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:36.793
WALL OF MY NEIGHBOR SAYS I WANNA

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.594
GO FOR SEED.

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:39.296
ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S CROSS

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:40.330
CONTAMINATION THERE THAT

00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:41.899
POLLINATION IS GONNA AFFECT ME.

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:42.833
AND SAYS GIVE ME SOME REAL

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.768
CHALLENGES I THINK TO BE WORKED

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:46.203
OUT THROUGH SOME REGULATION --

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:49.473
MAYBE CRANE SOME SOME ZONES THAT

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.542
ARE YOU KNOW GIVEN SOME DISTANCE --

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:54.578
TO PROTECT THOSE GUYS BUT IS SO

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.246
pIT JUST DEPENDS WHAT WHAT YOU'RE

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:59.349
LOOKING TO GROW -- BUT IT DID

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:00.284
THERE'S GOING TO BE SO THEY CAN

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.286
BE CHALLENGES WE'VE WE ALL KNOW

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:03.253
THAT -- THERE'S GONNA BE SOME

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.021
THAT WHEN YOU'RE STARTING TO

00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:05.455
TALK ABOUT A BRAND NEW CROP HERE

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:06.823
AND TRYING TO YOUR COMMENTS

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:12.362
EARLIER ABOUT THE REGULATIONS --

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:13.730
YEAH -- AS A FARMER I DON'T WANT

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:14.398
ANYMORE REGULATIONS AND

00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:15.299
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE AND YET

00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:17.301
THERE'S GONNA NEED TO BE SOME TO

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:18.368
BE ABLE.

00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:19.703
TO THE GUIDE FARMERS AND AND

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.371
GROWERS IN THE DIRECTION THAT

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:23.373
THE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS IN

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.410
A IN A PROPER WAY -- SO -- IT

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:27.444
BUT YEAH THERE'S GONNA BE SOME

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:28.679
SOME BUMPS.

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:29.913

AS AS YOU SAID IT'S A NEW CROP --

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:38.322
BUT I AM.

00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:41.325
IT IT'S NOT CLEAR.

00:47:41.391 --> 00:47:42.659
TODAY AS WE SIT HERE WHAT'S

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.795
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH SIGMA.

00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:47.798
AND WE HAVE.

00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:49.299
LOT AGRICULTURE THIS GOING TO BE

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:51.101
IMPACTED -- AND IT'S NOT GOING

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:53.136
TO BE GOOD AND A GOOD IMPACT SO

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:55.372
THE MORE THAT WE CAN FIND

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:55.939
ALTERNATIVE.

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:59.343
CROPS AND THE ABILITY I'VE BEEN

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:01.578
TOLD --AND I'VE TALKED TO

00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:03.347
SCIENTISTS FROM EUROPE THAT HAVE

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:05.182
BEEN GROWING HIM FOR A NUMBER OF

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:05.415
YEARS.

00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:08.252
THAT -- HIM HAS THE ABILITY TO

00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:09.086
CLEAN THE SOIL.

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:12.289
AND WHAT THAT MEANS BECOMES

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.657
REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT'S THE

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:16.093
SCIENCE BEHIND IT AND HOW CAN WE

00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:20.697
USE IT AND AND AND YET CONTINUE.

00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:23.300

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:28.905
FORWARD THINKING THIS IN THE

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.140
RISK THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:31.541
HAVE TAKEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:32.876
TO MOVE INTO SOMETHING THAT'S

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.111
TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUT I THINK

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:35.279
YOU ARE ON THE FOREFRONT OF

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:35.579
SOMETHING.

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:37.180
AND I'M I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT

00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:38.715

00:48:43.387 --> 00:48:44.288
PROTEIN.

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:46.023
AND IT COSTS A FORTUNE I MEAN

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:47.991
YOU COULDN'T LIVE ON HEMP SEEDS

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:49.293

00:48:52.462 --> 00:48:54.231
BECAUSE NOT ONLY IT IS IS IT A

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.766
COMMODITY YOU CAN EAT THAT HAS

00:48:55.832 --> 00:48:58.268
BENEFICIAL HEALTH VALUE BUT IT

00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:01.204
ALSO -- HAS THESE --

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:03.006
