NEARLY HALF THE NATION'S AND SHELTERED POPULATION RESIDE IN OUR STATE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS A FALLING IF FAILING LEAVING STUDENTS FAR BEHIND IN THEIR STUDIES AND STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIANS ARE ISOLATED THERE ALONE THEY'RE BATTLING BOTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH COMPLICATIONS AT ALARMING RATES. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING THEIR DOORS FOR GOOD IN CALIFORNIANS UNEMPLOYED ARE STRUGGLING TO COMPETE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WITH PRISONERS THEY DON'T DESERVE THOSE BENEFITS AND ALSO PEOPLE FROM OUT OF STATE.

SENATE RESOLUTION THREE BY SENATOR ATKINS RELATIVE TO THE STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO REGULAR SESSION. THE NEW ATKINS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATE RESOLUTION THREE WILL DOT THE SENATE RULES FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SESSION THE RULES ARE PRIMARILY THE SAME AS LAST SESSION BUT THEY DO REFLECT SOME LESSONS LEARNED AS WE NAVIGATE THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE WAY THE SENATE HAS TRADITIONALLY OPERATED. BUT WE HAVE TO FACE THE REALITY THAT SOMETIMES MODIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED. YOU CAN SEE THAT JUST BY LOOKING AROUND OF COURSE THE ROOM WE ARE IN TODAY. SO PLEASE JOIN ME IN ADOPTING SENATE RESOLUTION THREE TO ALLOW US TO DO THIS AND IT'S IMPORTANT BUSINESS FOR THE NEW SESSION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER ATKINS MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN ALL OF MY YEARS THAT I WILL NOT VOTE. FOR RULES. I WILL ABSTAIN I DON'T TEND TO VOTE NO. BUT THESE I CONSIDER PRETTY EGREGIOUS DEPARTURE. OF THE HISTORIC TRADITIONS OF THIS HONORABLE HOUSE. AND THEY AGREED. BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE. THEY ARE A DELIBERATE ATEMPT TO CONSTRAIN THE BAIT. WITH VERY BROAD PARAMETERS. AND PARAMETERS RATHER OF HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN. ALL THE GUYS OF COAL THAT. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE COVERED IT'S IRRELEVANT IT IS AN EXCUSE. BUT HE'S COMPROMISING OF THE RULES. AND IF IT IS SO IMPORTANT WHERE THE NOT NAY. THE SUNSET. THIS CALL WOULD THINK COULD END SOMETIME THIS YEAR WHY WOULD WE WANT TO OPERATE UNDER THESE RULES. WHEN THAT. FEAR IS EXTINGUISHED. AGAIN WE SAW SOME OF THIS. TOWARD THE END OF LAST RECESSION. LIMITING THE PARTICIPATION OF MEMBERS. EVEN CUTTING OFF THE MICROPHONES MEMBERS OF THE MINORITY PARTY WHO ARE REMOTING IN NOW THAT DOES NOT BE SUGGESTED HERE. BUT THE VERY EXPLICIT RESTRICTIONS ON THE BAIT. THIS IS CONFIRMED IT. CONTAINED IN HERE IS OWNERS. AND TO CHARACTERIZE THIS. AS CO DEFINED CODIFYING SENATE PRESIDENT IS A RONI US THIS IS NOT SENATE PRESIDENT FORMER MEMBERS OF THIS HONORABLE INSTITUTION THROUGH THE DECADES THAT I HAVE SERVED WHAT ABSOLUTELY BE INFURIATED BY THIS. AND I WOULD THINK THAT THE PRESS SHOULD BE CONCERNED AND MOST ASSUREDLY THE CITIZENS THAT WE REPRESENT. WE'RE NOT HERE EVERY DAY WHO MAYBE ONLY A REGULAR EVEN WATCH ANYTHING ON TV. BUT THIS IS NOT THE SENATE POSITIONED TO BE CONSTRAINED IN YOUR DEBATE. WE ARE ALWAYS RESPECTFUL IN OUR DEBATE. AND RESPECTFUL OF THE TIME OF OTHER MEMBERS. BUT I PARTICULARLY CONSIDERED REPREHENSIBLE TO SAY IT'S AN EXCUSE IF WE HAVE TOO MANY BILLS AT THE END OF SESSION THAT IS A PRODUCT OF NEGLIGENCE. OF EITHER HOUSE THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE YEAR TO MOVE THEIR BILL- TOMORROW. HAVE COMMITTEE HEARINGS. AND IT IS ALSO A CONVENIENT WAY FOR GAME PLAYERS THE MIDSHIPMEN APPEAL LIKE THE END OF SESSION. UNFORTUNATELY A FEW YEARS AGO THE CITIZENSHIP INTO THEIR OWN HANDS THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE. THE LEGISLATURE NEVER RESPONDED OVER DECADES TO THAT EITHER. AND HERE IS BUT ANOTHER EXAMPLE. IT IS A TERRIBLE WAY LADIES AND GENTLEMAN OF THE SENATE TO BEGIN OUR YEAR. TO BE A TERRIBLE WAY. TO FINISH OUR YEAR AS WAS THE END OF LAST YEAR I URGE AN ABSTENTION OR NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE- CENTER WILL MEMBERS- THERE'S A LITTLE BLAIR ON SOME OF THE FIELDS THE SO I APOLOGIZE IF I'M NOT INTENSELY TRYING TO MISS ANYONE RIGHT NOW TO PRESENT I JUST PUT IT UP SO YOU'RE FORGIVEN- I RISE. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE AS VICE CHAIR OF RULES COMMITTEE- WEEKS BEFORE WE WERE TO CONVENE THIS NEW SESSION I ASKED TO SEE A COPY OF THE RULES. AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROTEIN IS GOING THROUGH THEM AND I WOULD GET IT AN APPROPRIATE TIME. HISTORICALLY I BELIEVE WE'VE ALWAYS ADOPTED THEM ON ON THE ON THE FIRST DAY LEGISLATIVE SESSION SO I CONTINUE TO ASK. I GOT MY COPY AT AT ONE PM TODAY- AND I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S APPROPRIATE I ECHO EVERYTHING THAT- MY STEAM CALLING THE DEAN OF THE SENATE- UTTERED. BUT FOR ME IF WE WANT TO HAVE A VIBRANT. DEMOCRACY WE HAVE TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY. IN THESE ROLES I DON'T LIKE HIM. BUT WE SHOULD BE FAIR ABOUT IT. EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE IT IN ADVANCE NOTICE AND WE SHOULD HAVE A RIGOROUS DEBATE ABOUT IT YOU HAVE THE VOTES THERE'S NO THERE'S NO REASON. TO DO IT THIS WAY SO YOUR SHAME ON YOU FOR THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY WE'RE NOT OFF TO. WE ARE NOT OFF TO A GOOD START. AND I THINK I'M A PERSON OF GOODWILL. AND I TRY TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE WITH THIS FRANKLY IT'S IF IT'S OFFENSIVE. IT'S OFFENSIVE THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT AND- I HOPE WE CAN DO BETTER MOVING FORWARD AND I ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WELCOME. TO GO REMOTELY TO SENATOR STERN WHO HAS. HIS HAND UP SENATOR STERN. CENTER IF YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND THEN START SPEAKING. AS SENATOR HENRY STERN IN THE TWENTY SEVENTH DISTRICT- THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR THE RECOGNITION- I. I CAN'T RISE I GUESS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE- YOU KNOW I'M WE TALK ABOUT PROCESS AND BEING DENIED- CERTAIN RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES I CONSIDER TODAY'S REMOTE PARTICIPATION AND FRANKLY THE INABILITY TO CAST A FLOOR VOTE HERE. IN AN AMBITION OF MY OWN ABILITY TO REPRESENT MY CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF TRUST FRANKLY YOU KNOW HOW THESE CHAMBERS HAVE BEEN TREATED NOW THIS BODIES BEEN TREATED AT THE END OF SESSION LAST YEAR WE SAW IT IN STARK RELIEF. AND THAT WAS THE LACK OF. COMITY THAT TRADITION OF THE SENATE. IN LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR FELLOW MEMBERS IN CONDUCTING YOURSELF IN WALKING GENTLY AS OUR OPENING PRAYER PUT IT- WALKING GENTLY IN THIS MOMENT AND HOW YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF. AND HOW YOU WOULD HEAR TO BASIC PUBLIC HEALTH PROTOCOLS. NOW YOU CAN GET YOURSELF IN THESE CHAMBERS AND FRANKLY AND HOW YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF IN DEBATE. WHEN YOU YOURSELF IS X. OF EXPOSED THE BODY AND OTHER MEMBERS. TO THIS VIRUS- ANY OTHER ACCOMMODATED TO PARTICIPATE AND ACTUALLY VOTE IN THE PROCESS. DESPITE THAT EXPOSURE. AND TO UTILIZE AN EXPLOIT THAT PROCESS TO COME UP THE GEARS OF DEMOCRACY TO ME THAT'S THAT'S THE DEEPER OFFENSE. I DON'T WANT TO RE LITIGATE THE PAST AND MAKE TODAY ABOUT A RETROSPECTIVE- BUT I CONSIDER THESE RULES A CRITICAL PIECE OF MOVING FORWARD. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO OPERATE AS A BODY IT IS ON FACEBOOK LIVE WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE ON A REMOTE TO. USING THIS IS A POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING. GOING TO TALK ABOUT PEACE AND WALKING GENTLY LET'S SHOW. THE SEATED AT PEACE I SEE HER TODAY THE PART OF THE REASON I'M NOT UP THERE. PARTICIPATING IN THE SENSITIVITY MY FAMILY. YEAH I'M I'M LEGISLATING BUT I'M CARE TAKING TO. YOU KNOW WHAT I MY WIFE AND I ARE DEALING WITH CHALLENGES IN THAT REGARD THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT LIFE AND DEATH EVERYDAY CHALLENGES. EMILY IN A NURSING HOME. AND CARE TAKING FOR NINETY THREE YEAR OLD MAN EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND I DIDN'T FEEL IT PRUDENT. TO COME INTO THOSE CHAMBERS WITHOUT SOME ASSURANCES LIKE WE HAVE IN THESE ROLES HERE TODAY. IT PROTOCOLS AND PRACTICES WE'RE GOING TO BE. CARRIED OUT AND ENFORCED. BY OUR LEADERSHIP WE WERE BUILT ON- SOME KIND OF SIMILAR TO TRUST THAT TO ME WAS ERODED SO IRREPARABLE THE AT THE END OF LAST SESSION WE NEED ACTION LIKE THIS TODAY TO FORMALIZE IT I WILL SAY THOSE SEEDS OF HOPE AS I MENTIONED ARE THERE. I'VE HEARD THAT THERE'S- UNIFORMITY HEARINGS TO OUR TESTING PROTOCOLS IS THE REPORTS THAT- I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE ON THE FLOOR AS AS PARTICIPATING IN AN EXERCISE AND THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY GOOD SIGN- BUT- I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO JUST GO ON WORD ALONE ANYMORE THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA BE VOTING. I IN SUPPORT OF THESE ROLE CHANGES HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. LIKE MANY OF YOU I AD TO TRAVEL TO GET SACRAMENTO TODAY. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. MY OFFICE LIKE MANY OTHERS GOT A COPY OF THIS. AFTER TWELVE THIRTY THIS AFTERNOON I CAME INTO MY OFFICE BUT SEVEN TO TEN MINUTES BEFORE TWO O'CLOCK. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS DOCUMENT SAYS. AND IT'S NOT A SIMPLE DOCUMENT IT IS DOCUMENT WITHIN. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROCEDURAL CHANGES TO OR OR RULES AND I THINK THERE'S ABOUT FORTY PAGES HERE AND I THINK- ALL OF ITS RELEVANT. NOT JUST THE SUMMARY SO- I'M NOT NECESSARILY TAKING A SIDE ON WHETHER THESE THINGS ARE APPROPRIATE MY- COLLEAGUE FROM- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST BROKE A MOMENT AGO SAYING IT'S NEEDED MY COLLEAGUE- ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. AND SAID THAT IT IS A DEVIATION A PAST PRACTICE AND PRECEDENT. TO BE HONEST I DON'T EVEN KNOW. SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE AT LEAST CONSIDER MAYBE BRING THIS ITEM BACK ON FRIDAY WHEN WE HAVE FLOOR SESSION NEXT AS A POSSIBILITY FOR US TO BETTER APPRECIATE THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS ACTION ITEM. BUT WITHOUT THAT I'LL BE CASTING. A NOTE IN ITS TENSION VOTERS SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S IN IT. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THESE RULES AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE RULES WHICH FLOW DIRECTLY FROM THE COVETING THAT WE HAD TO DO LAST YEAR THESE RULES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE HAD TO CHANGE HOW WE DID HOW WE OPERATED LAST YEAR SORT OF THE ASSEMBLY. BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND WE INSTITUTED A NUMBER OF NEW APPROACHES- SOME OF WHICH ARE NOW BEING CODIFIED. IN THESE RULES THESE RULES SPECIFICALLY GIVE THE PROTON THE ABILITY. TO REQUIRE CERTAIN BEHAVIORS AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH LIKE WEARING MASKS. FIVE THESE ARE OUR RULES WILL MAKE CLEAR- THAT WE HAVE FLEXIBILITY WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF A COMMITTEE CHAIR- IS NOT ABLE TO PHYSICALLY BE HERE TO PRESIDE OVER COMMITTEE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PIVOT QUICKLY. THAT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH. APPROACH AND IN TERMS OF LIMITING. THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE CAN SPEAK THIS DOESN'T LIMIT TO BE. I CAN STILL SPEAK TO ANY BILL. BUT IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN ACCESS SPEAK FOR PERHAPS AS LONG AS YOU WANT AND FRANKLY. ALL OF US IN THIS PROFESSION EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. COULD PROBABLY USE SOMETIMES SELF EDITING THAT'S OF THE HUMAN NATURE WE SOMETIMES GO ON A LITTLE BIT TOO LONG. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THINGS YOU CAN SAY IN THREE MINUTES AND WE DON'T NEED AN EXTENDED. PERIOD OF TIME BENEFIT LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE ARE TOGETHER. AND A FOR A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENT AND HOW WE DO THE BATES WITH EVERYONE GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THAT'S GOOD FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AS WE GO THROUGH THE VERY WORST PART. OF THIS PANDEMIC. OVER EXPERIENCING NOW IS WORSE THAN ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. AND FINALLY THIS IS DEMOCRATIC. BY LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT PEOPLE CAN SPEAK. THAT PREVENTS FILIBUSTERING THAT PREVENTS OTHER PEOPLE FROM PARTICIPATING AND I CAN RESULT IN THE DEATH OF BILLS NOT BECAUSE OF DEMOCRACY. BUT BECAUSE SOMEONE FILIBUSTER THESE ARE GOOD RULES AND I SUPPORT THEM. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS- I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF PASSAGE OF- OF THESE RULES- I DO APPRECIATE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM TO HANNAH AND HIS HIS LONGSTANDING EXPERIENCE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS PERSPECTIVE. AND AND HIS REMARKS BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT AND I APPRECIATE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO POINTS OUT WE ARE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC AND EMERGENCY A PANDEMIC WE HAVEN'T SEEN. THE LIKES OF PROBABLY SENSE. NINETEEN EIGHTEEN- AND- I WOULD- AND SO CERTAINLY WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DO THINGS AND WE DID THAT LAST YEAR AND I THINK MADE THE CHANGES IN THE RULES THESE RULES ARE BEFORE US IS TO CODIFY THAT. I WOULD POINT OUT ALL THE CHANGES WE'VE HAD TO MAKE SO OF COURSE WE ARE SPREAD OUT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRODUCING ROUGHLY OR SPREAD OUT HERE ON THE FLOOR. OF THE WINDOWS ARE OPEN TO TRY TO INCREASE VENTILATION RIGHT- WE ARE FALLING PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES. AND THEIR- WE HAVE GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS COMING UP- GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE ARE- APPROVED VACCINES THAT ARE SAFE AND EFFICACIOUS BUT WE STILL HAVE TO GET THEM TO PEOPLE. AND THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A NEW STRAIN OUT THERE THAT'S EVEN MORE INFECTIOUS- THAN EVER THAT'S THE READY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES STARTED U. K. AND- SO. IN ORDER FOR US TO FUNCTION AS A SENATE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SAFELY FOR OURSELVES OUR STAFF THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL. IN THESE ROLES. HELP US TO DO THAT. THE OTHER THING IS THAT- YEAH CERTAINLY GOING TO LOOK AT THE LIMITATIONS ON DEBATE HERE ON THE FLOOR AND HE'S A BIT OF A TRADE OFF. RIGHT I THINK WE WANNA BE SURE EVERYONE'S ABLE TO SAY- MAKE THE POINTS THEY WANT TO MAKE. SAME TIME THE LONGER WE SPEND TOGETHER. IN THIS CHAMBER AND I LOVE ALL OF YOU. I LOVE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU BUT IT'S ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY EVERY. THE LONGER IT DRAGS OUT. ALONG WE SPEND EACH OTHER THE HIGHER THE RISK IS THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THE WINDOWS OPEN. AND SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL GET TO A PLACE WHERE- WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS VIRUS ANYMORE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON. BUT FRANKLY AS- THE PHYSICIAN HERE IN THE CHAMBER AND SOMEONE WHO HAS A PUBLIC HEALTH BACKGROUND. I DO VIEW THAT THESE RULES ARE IMPORTANT RESPONSE TO TRYING TO KEEP. US SAFE. SO WITH THAT- I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THE RULES THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN SIGNAL FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. THE CENTER WILL GO RIGHT BACK TO YOU SENATOR BATES WERE YOU TRYING TO RAISE YOUR HAND. I YES CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN BORROW. THANK YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND PROCEED I SAID IT SHOULD BE SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY SIX YES MY- RAISE YOUR HAND ICON IS NOT WORKING ON MY COMPUTER AT THE MOMENT I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSCORE- THE REQUESTED BY MY- COLLEAGUES FRIENDS- THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF. REGARDING PUTTING IT OVER I JUST WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO TWO OR THREE DAYS OBVIOUSLY BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY MY DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES. THEY PROBABLY HAD MAYBE MORE ADVANCED BRIEFING ON WHAT IS REALLY CONTINUE TO NEEDS THEY DON'T APPEAR TO BE- THAT RESTRICTIVE BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF GOING FORWARD IN UNITY. A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT THESE DAYS I DON'T SEE THE HARM IN IT TOO WHAT IS IT. FOUR DAYS- AN OPPORTUNITY% TO DIG INTO THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF SOMETHING THAT CHANGES ARE FLOOR PROCESS SEES BUT THAT LET PUTS EVERYBODY ON NOTICE THAT THESE ARE THE RULES. AND ARE WE NEED TO FOLLOW DOWN ON GIVING YOU KNOW THE CITY THE SESSION THE AND POTENTIAL LIMITING OF THE SECTION THE OF THE PANDEMIC DOESN'T COME UNDER GREATER CONTROL CAN I SPEAK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT PLAN FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE.

MAINLY FOCUSED ON KEEPING OUR FAMILIES SAFE SO I WOULD URGE US TO RECONSIDER- THE OF THE CONCERN HAS BEEN EXPRESSED REGARDING IS BASICALLY PLEASE GIVE ME A FEW MORE DAYS.

I'M THINKING OUT OF FOLLOW UP MY CALLER COME IN FROM C. DIEGOAND SEVERAL CA THAT WERE MADE ON THIS REALIZE THAT THE IN THE SESSION WAS KIND OF. AND BUT I THINK THAT POLICY SHOULD BE VIGOROUSLY DEBATED IN TRANSPARENCY SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AND I THINK THAT EACH ONE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS- WANT TO HEAR US SPEAK AND DEBATE THAT PARTICULAR BILLS ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A SUBJECT MATTER THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS SO- THE MANDATORY TO HAVE A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY IF POSSIBLE PLEASE PROCEED IT IS IT OKAY- CAN WE HAVE A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY AND WERE WE ABLE TO MAKE A MOTION. TO AND SET THIS ASIDE UNTIL FRIDAY TO WE RECONVENE SO THAT MEMBERS WHO DID JUST RECEIVE THIS I DID RECEIVE IT ABOUT THE SAME TIME I THE MY COLLEAGUES DID- ON THE SIDE OF THE AISLE IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN SET THIS ASIDE UNTIL FRIDAY SO WE HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION AND GOTCHA.

NOW MEMBERS WE WILL NOT GOING TO A REMOTE MEMBERS THEY'RE NOT VOTING TODAY SO HIS TWENTY FOUR NO SEVEN THE MOTION IS LAID ON THE TABLE WE WILL NOW GO TO CENTER ACTIONS FOR HER CLOSING REMARKS MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND JUST FOR CONTEXT TO THAT LAST VOTE THE REASON THE DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES VOTED THE WAY THEY DID IS THAT WE WOULD BE UNABLE THIS WEEK TO MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT ITEM OF BUSINESS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULES COMMITTEE AND THEREFORE WE WOULD ALSO BE UNABLE TO HAVE A BUDGET COMMITTEE MEETING THIS WEK AS ANTICIPATED. AS WELL AS- OUR DAY POTENTIAL OF AN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WE HAVE TO APPROVE THE RULES AS I UNDERSTAND IT- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED AND TO DO THE WORK TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF COMMENTS I WOULD- I WOULD SAY A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE I TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO- THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS GOT THE RULES AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME TODAY- AS WELL I WOULD DO I RESPOND TO THE TO THE GENTLEMAN AND THE DEAN. OF FROM TO HEMA AND SAY THAT IN RESEARCHING WHAT TO DO IN IN TIMES OF CRISIS AND EMERGENCY WE'VE WE'VE GOT AT LEAST FOUR EXAMPLES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ASK FOR FROM OUR CLERK OF TIMES IN WHICH DEBATE WAS LIMITED DOES THAT MEAN WE SHOULD DO IT I JUST OUT OF HAND WITHOUT SERIOUS CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION AND WE APPROVE THESE RULES LAST YEAR IN MARCH BECAUSE WE WERE I IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS AS A BODY AND BE ABLE TO GO HOME TO OUR DISTRICTS WHILE WE ADDRESSED WHAT TO DO. IN A PANDEMIC SOMETHING WE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS BODY HAD NOT EXPERIENCE FOR MORE THAN A- CENTURY. SO NONE OF THESE DECISIONS ARE TAKEN LIGHTLY- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO- SO I WOULD SAY THERE IS PRECEDENT AND IT IS PRESIDENT THAT WE SHOULD WEIGH HEAVILY. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CLARITA- IT IS TRUE WE TYPICALLY TAKE UP THE RULES ON THE FIRST ORGANIZATIONAL SESSION. MOST EVERYTHING WE DID INCLUDING THE CELEBRATE TORY NATURE. OF OUR OF BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE NEW MEMBERS THAT WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD FOR TWO YEARS TO BE ABLE TO JOIN THIS BODY. SO WE HAVE LIMITED AND LIMITED AND LIMITED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY ABILITY TO MEET THE PUBLIC HEALTH. CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUE THE DOCTOR FROM SACRAMENTO. WE HAVE HAD TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS FOR AMONG OTHER EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AT THE END OF SESSION TWO YEARS AGO WHERE WE HAD TO ADJUST HOW WE CONDUCTED OUR BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO FINISH OUR BUSINESS WHEN WE- I HAD THE INCIDENT IN THE CHAMBER- THIS IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE COUPLE OF YEARS AND I WOULD JUST. SAY ALSO IN DECEMBER OUR ORGANIZATIONAL SESSION OUT WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF ALL A SEARCH. HERE WE ARE TODAY WERE STILL IN THE MIDST OF A SUPER SURGE IN WHICH WE NEED TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. AND LEAVE AT OUR PRIORITIES AS I STATED IN OUR OPENING COMMENTS HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE CRISIS. AND THE RESULT OF THIS PANDEMIC AND CRISIS THAT'S CALLED ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY OUTLINED BY THE REPUBLICAN LEADER AS WELL AS MY COMMENTS. SO I. FURTHER THE RULES ARE THANK IT INCOME IN A MERGING SECTION OF OUR RULES ARE NOT THROUGHOUT THE RULES AS IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO. TO ACT IN THIS MANNER IN PERPETUITY FAR FROM IT. AND ARE I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE ABLE TO SAY THESE RULES WILL BE IN EFFECT FROM THIS STATE TO THIS STATE KNOWING THAT THE PANDEMIC WAS DONE BUT WE CANNOT SAY THAT. AND SO I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT MY DEMOCRATIC AS WELL AS MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES. ARE GOING TO HOLD US ALL ACCOUNTABLE TO ADJUSTING THE SITUATION AS SOON AS WE POSSIBLY CAN AND PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK SAFELY. BECAUSE WE ALL VALUE DEBATE AND DISCUSSION. SO MUCH SO THAT IN THE RULES IT SAYS WE CAN SUSPEND. THE RULES IF WE NEED FURTHER DEBATE AS WE PROBABLY AND MORE THAN LIKELY WILL NEED TO DO ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES IN WHICH- WE ALL COME AT IT FROM A VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IN THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS. I WOULD HOPE LASTLY. JUST TO SAY THAT- THE RECORD. THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT FORWARD. WHEN MY- DURING MY TENURE IN THE ASSEMBLY MY TENURE HERE SHOWS. A THOUGHTFULNESS AND APPROACH THAT SEEKS TO BALANCE THE CONCERNS AND THE NEEDS THAT WE NEED TO DO WITH THE RESPECT THAT I HAVE FOR EVERY SINGLE COLLEAGUE IN THIS ROOM. REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE REGARDLESS OF YOUR POLITICAL PARTY REGARDLESS OF YOUR PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS. WE HAVE WORK TO DO COLLECTIVELY. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT PEOPLE I KNOW ME ENOUGH ALL IN THE APPROACH I TAKE TO UNDERSTAND. THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO LIMIT SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO REPRESENT THEIR CONSTITUENTS FAR FROM IT AS REFERENCE BY. I THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES WHO WAS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY- WE HAVE SOUGHT TO GIVE EVERYBODY A VOICE. AND A REPEAT REPRESENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT TODAY I BELIEVE IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PASS THESE RULES SO THAT WE CAN GET ON WITH THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO. AND THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A RULES COMMITTEE SET THE REST OF THE AGENDA FOR THIS WEEK AND THEN LEAVE THE CHAMBER SAFELY. I AND FOLLOW THE PRECAUTIONS IN THE GUIDELINES THAT THE CDC AND OTHERS HAVE PUT INTO PLACE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH. SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT S. R. THREE AND ESTABLISHING ARE SENATE RULES TODAY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS MEMBERS WILL BE MOST VOTING BY ACCLAMATION ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF SENATE RESOLUTION.
