CURRENTLY THE LAW DOES NOT. TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT -- TO POST UNPAID WAGES DUE TO EMPLOYEES FROM EMPLOYERS ON A WEBSITE. IN SOME CASES ALTHOUGH THERE'S BEEN A DETERMINATION AND FORMER EMPLOYEES DO MONEY. FROM AN EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYEE MAY NEVER LEARN OF IT AND NEVER CLAIM THE MONEY. SO WHAT THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES IS A REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT TO LIST ALL SUCH FUNDS ON A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WEBSITE. THE WEBSITE WILL BE INDEXED BY THE NAME OF THE EMPLOYEE THE NAME OF THE EMPLOYER. THE AMOUNT OF WAGES AND BENEFITS AND THE DATE THEY WERE DEPOSITED -- IF WE THINK THIS IS A THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT -- EMPLOYEES RECEIVE THE WAGES THAT THERE DO WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO ON THIS BILL AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO WORK AT A LITTLE BIT TO A JUST A JUST SOME OF THE PROVISIONS.

THROUGH A CITATION ISSUED AGAINST AN EMPLOYER IN OTHER RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS THE CITATIONS MAY BE PROSECUTED TOGETHER IN A SINGLE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING WHEN THE CITATIONS ARE APPEALED. CONTRACT WAGES HOWEVER MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ONLY THROUGH A CIVIL ACTION FILED IN SUPERIOR COURT. VIOLATIONS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PAY REQUIREMENTS ARE OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY NON PAYMENT OF CONTRACT WHICH IS. OVER THE LABOR COMMISSIONER JUST NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ASSESS AND PROSECUTE CONTRACT WHICH IS IN HIS UNABLE TO PROSECUTE COMPANION CONTRACT WAGE VIOLATIONS. IN THE SAME ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING AS MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME VIOLATIONS SENATE BILL SIX EIGHT EIGHT GIVES THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. THE AUTHORITY TO ASSESS UNPAID CONTRACTUAL WAGES TO A CITATION ISSUED AGAINST AN EMPLOYER. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE WORKERS ARE PAID THEIR APPROPRIATE CONTRACTUAL WAGES IN A TIMELY MANNER.

A DAVID BALTAR ASSISTANT CHIEF COUNSEL WITH DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS LINK THANK YOU SENATOR MONEY A GREAT BUILT BY THE WAY. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN PROCESS IDEA ARE MEMBERS INCLUDING CENTER LINE. YEAH. WAIT STAFF IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE IMPACT ON US AND OUR CONTRACTORS ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REPORTED THAT HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WERE NOT REPORTED OR WERE MISCLASSIFIED. A 40% INCREASE SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO FAQ INSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY -- AND HALF OF WHAT PROPERLY REPORTED WORKERS EARN IN A THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN POVERTY. BUT IT'S NOT JUST CONSTRUCTION LAST YEAR A REPORT BY THE CORPORATE RESEARCH PROJECT OF GOOD JOBS FIRST. WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS ARTICLE. AS STATED THAT THE NINE WORKERS FAIR WAGES IS PERVASIVE AND I QUOTE FAR BEYOND SWEAT SHOPS FAST FOOD OUTLETS AND RETAILERS. THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT STATED THAT WASTE AFTER WAS AGAIN QUOTE BUILT INTO THE BUSINESS MODEL OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF CORPORATE AMERICA. WE SUPPORT SIX ADA BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S ENFORCEMENT IS LACKING AS IT RELATES TO THE WORLD CLASS ECONOMY THEY HEALTH. THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WITH A WORKFORCE OF OVER SEVENTEEN MILLION. TWICE THE THE SIZE OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON NEEDS TO ADJUST AND PROVIDE PROPER FORSMAN TOOLS TO PREVENT THESE TYPES OF VIOLATIONS AND WE ARE AT YOUR SUPPORT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST OBSERVERS ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF WITH A MAKERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHIRLA MEMBERSMUCH DARKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU AGAR OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NO -- ONE IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY AND MINING FOR CURTIS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND WILLINGNESS AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK WITH US ON THIS ISSUE. OUR CONCERNS ARE THAT THE LABOR CODE PROVISION THAT IS AMENDED ALLOWS FOR PERSONAL LIABILITY AS WELL AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. AND THIS IS PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR ANYONE THAT IS INTRICATE THAT IS INVOLVED WITH THE PAYMENT OF WAGES FOR THE EMPLOYEES WHICH INCLUDE HUMAN RESOURCES PROFESSIONALS. AS WELL AS AND MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS THIS CLAIM COULD ALSO BE BROUGHT UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT SO THEN YOU HAVE THOSE PENALTIES. THAT WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR THE PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THOSE ARE MAIN CONCERNS WITH REGARD TO AMENDING THIS SPECIFIC -- WAGE PROVISIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION MR. YES MISTER CHAIR CHRIS MCKINLEY ON BEHALF OF A CALIFORNIA BUILDS ASSOCIATION WE SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT WE'RE NUMERATOR BY MISS CURTIS THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION SEE NO ONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR PAN. NICE TO SEE YOU HERE THIS MORNING. GINGER COMMENT -- HOW HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT KATIE A CHAMBERS CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE LIABILITY RIGHT WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LIQUIDATED DAMAGES THAT'S A CONTRACTUAL PROVISION SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT? GETS CREATED IN THE ENFORCEMENT SO IT'S BEEN AGREED TO IN A CONTRACT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. THERE WAS ANOTHER ELEMENT IN THE CHAMBERS LETTER OF OPPOSITION -- THAT I DON'T THINK WAS HIGHLIGHTED HERE BUT THE CONCERN OF THE POTENTIAL ADDED BURDEN OF SIT SIT DEPARTMENT LABOR CAN ENFORCE. MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME PAY ET CETERA BY ALLOWING THOSE PROVISIONS FROM A CONTRACT TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE ADMINISTRATIVE ARENA. IN ACTUALLY IN MY VIEW WOULD CONSOLIDATE ISSUES THAT COULD BE DEALT WITH AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL AND KEEP YOU OUT OF A A SIMULTANEOUS COURT ENFORCEMENT -- I THINK IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF BOTH SIDES TO CONSOLIDATE ANY CLAIMS AND TRY TO DISPENSE WITH THEM IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING. INSTEAD OF CORD ALTOGETHER THAT WOULD BE MY RESPONSE IN THE QUESTION RELATED TO PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR A HUMAN RESOURCES PROFESSIONAL OR SOMEONE THAT WOULD BE. IS THAT. I AM GONNA DIFFER I'M NOT SURE THAT I FOLLOW THAT -- CONCERNS DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT. ACTUALLY IT IT THEN THAT'S FINE I DID GET ANY ENTRY IT'S STILL ALL TODAY AND APPLIES TO ANY MINIMUM WAGE ENFORCEMENT ACTION SO IT. IT'S IT'S JUST ADDING IT TO THAT PARTICULAR CONTRACTUAL CATEGORY. YOUR USUAL FOR SOMEONE IN THE ROLE OF A PERSONNEL MANAGER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO BE HELD. LIABLE IT'S FOR SOMEONE WHO CAUSES VIOLATION. GENERALLY SPEAKING I MEAN FOR MURDER FORSMAN STANDPOINT THE AGENCIES LOOK LOOKING AT LARGELY SMALL -- S. CORPORATION TYPE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE REALLY IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN. THE THE CORPORATION AND THE INDIVIDUAL OWNERS IN THEIR HANDS ON INVOLVED IN MANAGING BUSINESS. THANK OU COULD YOU SHOULD STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD SURE INSIDE DAVID BALL TERM AN ASSISTANT CHIEF COUNSEL WITH THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER -- VIEWED IT SINCEWE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM WE CAN ESTABLISH THAT AND CAN'T TAKE A MOTION BUT WE APPRECIATE THAT WE WILL. OF CERTAINLY TAKE UP THE MATTER WHEN THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. JUST AT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE IN APPRECIATE YOUR ACCOMMODATING. EVERYBODY SCHEDULES TODAY HAVE A GOOD HEARING THANK YOU THANK YOU CEREMONY WE WILL DO THAT APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR THANK YOU. FORGET SENATOR GALGIANI GOOD MORNING [inaudible] PLEASE COME. COME FORWARD THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB [inaudible] FIVE GOOD MORNING. WELCOME MORE TO MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SB FIVE THIRTY WILL REQUIRE THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT TO DEVELOP AN INDUSTRY SPECIFIC HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION PREVENTION POLICY. FOR USE BY EMPLOYERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. I'M GOING REVELATIONS UNDERSCORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WIDESPREAD SEXUAL HARASSMENT EXISTS WITHIN VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY. THESE INCIDENTS UNDERMINE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OUR STATE IS MADE TOWARDS GENDER EQUITY IN THE WORKPLACE. HIGHLY SKILLED AND TRAINED WOMEN OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO CALIFORNIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOWEVER DESPITE EFFORTS TO RECRUIT WOMEN INTO THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WOMEN MAKE THAT JUST EIGHT POINT 5%. OF CALIFORNIANS TOLL CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE AND ONLY IN THE EMPRESS APPRENTICES SHIPPED SYSTEM. SB FIVE THIRTY ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY ESTABLISHING AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP AN INDUSTRY SPECIFIC ANTI HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION POLICY IN TRAINING STANDARD. FOR USE BY CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS. DIRECTLY ADDRESSING THE ON GOING HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION ISSUES ON THE JOB SITE WILL ENSURE ALL WORKERS ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND EQUALLY AND WILL HELP CHANGE THE CULTURE OF THE INDUSTRY. THIS BILL SPONSORED BY STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES OR WITH ME TODAY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. SB FIVE THIRTY CURRENTLY HAS NO OPPOSITION THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PLEASE. HELLO MEDIAN REDUCE MYSELF SENATORS THANK YOU FOR HEARING FROM US TODAY MY NAME IS MEGAN MAY SEE. AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF TRADE SOME IN INK I'M ALSO A FORTY YEAR MEMBER OF IBEW LOCAL THREE OH TWO AND GRADUATED FROM MY PARTNERSHIP. AND WORK WITH THE TOOLS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE I GAVE IT UP FOR FLUSH TOILETS AND A PHONE AND WITH THE LIGHTS ALREADY IN THE BUILDING -- I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THIS TODAY AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE NEED FOR THIS KIND OF SPECIFIC TRAINING AND WHY IT ISN'T. JUST A SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING OFF THE SHELF. AND I SPEAK FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE PLUS THE WOMEN THAT WE WORK WITH TODAY. ADDRESSING THE INDUSTRY ISSUES HERE AND I'M ALSO VERY PLEASED TO BE JOINED IN THIS WITH THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES WHO ARE HELPING US WITH THIS ISSUE AND MOVE THE INDUSTRY FORWARD -- AS A SENATOR GALGIANI STATED WERE ONLY 3% OF THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES FOR WOMEN WHO WORK WITH THE TOOLS THAT NUMBERS ABOUT THE SAME -- THE NOT THE 89% IS EVERYONE THAT INCLUDES ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THERE'S WHO ARE THE DIRECT LINE OF HIRE AND FIRE THE DIFFERENT IN ITS HR PROCESSES FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES. YOU DON'T GO INTO THE OFFICE YOU MAY NEVER SEE YOUR CONTRACTOR'S OFFICE YOU MAY WORK THERE THREE YEARS AND NEVER SEE THE CONTRACTOR'S OFFICE. IF YOUR RANK AND FILE WORKER YOU A REPORT TO THE JOB SITE YOUR DIRECT SUPERVISOR IS YOUR FOREMAN. AND OF THAT. PERSON HAS THE RIGHT OF HIRE AND FIRE OVER YOU YOUR TEMPORARY WORKER. THESE ARE IT'S A WONDERFUL CAREER BUT IT COMES WITH A OF WITH SOME DRAWBACKS PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU ARE. A WOMAN. AND ONLY HAVE 3% YOU KNOW THE YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE THE ONLY WOMAN ON THAT JOB SITE. WE ARE REALLY PLEASED TO BE WORKING. WITH THE INDUSTRY TO UPGRADE THE CONDITIONS ON THE JOB SITE BUT ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS FOR ATTRITION PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN. IS THE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS THAT THEY DO A CONFRONT ON THE JOB SITE AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT SB. FIVE THIRTY IS A U. S. SIGNIFICANT TOOL TO BRING CONTRACTORS TO THE TABLE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT CONTRACTORS HAVE A VERY POSITIVE ROLE. TO PLAY WITH THE TRUCK IN CREATING A TRAINING THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK. ON THE JOB SITE AND NOT ONE THAT'S GIVEN TO UPPER LEVEL SUPERINTENDENTS. ON THEIR YEARLY WE TREAT WE THINK THAT DIFFERENCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE MADE A STEP FORWARD WITH C.. E. O. REQUIREMENTS AN APPRENTICESHIP WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD PARTNER VERY NICELY WITH THAT WE ALSO BELIEVE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE INDUSTRY SPECIFICITY. OF OF THE ISSUES ON A CONSTRUCTION SITE THAT THIS IS NOT A D. F. E. H.. FROM CONCERN IT'S REALLY A DEALER SEE CONCERN BECAUSE IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SPECIFIC SPECIFICITY OF THE INDUSTRY. BECAUSE THE D. L. L. C. ALREADY DEALS WITH APPRENTICESHIP IN IN AND OF OVERSIGHT A PREVAILING WAGE IT HAS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE. WE ALSO REALLY AND WHEN YOU ARE THIS MUCH OF A MINORITY IN A IN A IN AN INDUSTRY. YOU ARE NOT REALLY IN A POSITION TO HAVE A PLAINTIVE DRIVEN PROCESS THIS IS WHY WE'RE WORKING REALLY CAREFUL CAREFULLY AND WITH OUR PARTNERS AND WANT TO BRING CONTRACT CONTRACTORS TO THE TABLE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. A FULL COURT PRESS WITH ALL THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE AT THE TABLE ALL THE IMPORTANT IN INTEREST AT THE TABLE. TO MAKE IT BETTER WORK SITE CULTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WHAT WAS YOUR MEMBERS -- I KEEP CANNOT BE MORE ELOQUENT THAN THAT THAT WAS A PERFECT TESTIMONY YOU JUST WANNA SAY THAT UP THE SECOND TIME WE RUN THE LEGISLATION. OF FOR THE REASONS THAT MAKE BASS HE STATED -- WHY IT'S BETTER SUITED AT THE I. R. VERSUS THE FE H. ON WE ARE TRYING TO AND FROM THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL ALL THE WAY UP TO THE A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE? OF PASSAGE LEGISLATION -- IN CO SPONSORSHIP WITH -- TRADE WOMEN THANK LAST YEAR THIS BUILDS UPON THAT AND LOOKS AT THE CONSTRUCTION SPECIFIC POLICY. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATED BETTER WORK ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL EVERY EVERY WORKER ON THE CONSTRUCTION WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE HIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CENTERS THOSE SERVERS ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF WITH A MAKERS IN SUPPORT OF AN ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE COLLEAGUES THANK YOU.

MITCHELL HERE PAT. YEAH PAN HERE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE WE DIDN'T AND WE DO HAVE A PROMOTION COMING IN AND I THINK THIS IS THIS IS A GREAT. DEAL THE GREAT BILL AND AND AND I THINK TIMELY BUT THIS IS KIND OF FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR BILL SENATOR MITCHELL FROM LAST YEAR. THAT -- TRIES TO IN THE IS THE CONCERN OF THE QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED IS THAT THE TRAINING YOU KNOW ONCE THIS THIS TRAINING REQUIREMENTS SHOULD COME UNDER THAT -- IT BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO THEN HAVE WHATEVER EVALUATION FROM A COMMISSION TO LOOK AT THE EFFECT OF THAT IN THE BENEFITING WEATHERED ACTUALLY IS WORKING. AND AND A TV IN THAT SHOW OF MAYBE A LITTLE TIME. SPREAD BEFORE THAT THAT STARCH AND CAN CAN LOOK AT THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT OR LOOK AT THE FUTURE BUT I DO THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. TO KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT GOOD LEGISLATION FROM LIFE I WOULD AGREE AND AND AND APPRECIATE THE VALUATION BUT I THINK THE ULTIMATE TEST IS WHEN THE CULTURE SHIFT IN WORK SPACES ACROSS THIS STATE AND COUNTRY AND AND AND WOMEN. AND MEN FEEL AND EXPERIENCE THAT DIRECTLY THAT'S THE ULTIMATE TEST OF SUCCESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BUT I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL VERY GOOD THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE ARRIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE THE SENATE A MOTION BY SENATOR MITCHELL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS HILL I FEEL I'M RURAL. MITCHELL. HI MITCHELL AYE POUND RIGHT PAN I HAVE THREE THREE VOTES WILL HOLD THE ROLE WILL CONTRAPTION MEMBRANE A VERY MUCH. WONDERFUL. CENTER STRINGENT IS WAY DOWN AND I THINK I WILL PRESENT IF IT WORKS ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB. FIVE THIRTY SEVEN I WILL TURN THE GAVEL SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU ATWATER CHAIRING BOTH -- LABOR AND PURRS BEFORE A TO GET STILL LEVEES HAVE THE DEVIL HERE OKAY -- SO WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING I ITEM NUMBER FIVE SP FIVE THIRTY SEVEN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS AND EXCELLENT COMMITTEE -- AS DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS OR M. P. ENDS ARE A KEY TOOL IN OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THAT INJURED WORKERS GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY. M. PEONS ALSO ENSURE THAT WORKERS HAVE ENOUGH CHOICE TO ACCESS MEDICAL CARE WITH PROVIDERS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE TO SEE. HOWEVER MORE AND MORE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE STEPPED FORWARD WITH CONCERNS ON HOW IN PEONS ARE OPERATING IN THIS STATE SPECIFICALLY. THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION REPORTS THAT SOME IN PEONS ARE PLACING PROFITS BEFORE CARE. AS WE DOCUMENTED IN A RECENT LAWSUIT C. P. T. A. WITH HAS SHOWN MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF PHYSICAL THERAPIST BEING PUSHED. TO TAKE LOWER AND LOWER REIMBURSEMENTS FREQUENTLY BY REVEALING THAT NEIGHBORING PT'S HAVE AGREED TO LOWER RATES. THIS RACE TO THE BOTTOM DRIVES PT'S OUT OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM HURTING BOTH INJURED WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS TRYING TO RETURN THEIR INJURED WORKERS TO WORK. SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THIS RACE TO THE BOTTOM BY SETTING THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE AS THE MINIMUM REIMBURSEMENT HALTING THE RIGHT THE REYES. THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM ADDITIONALLY SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES TO OTHER ISSUES RAISED BY C. P. T. A. M. P. AND N.. M. P. ENDS CHANGING A MEDICAL PROVIDER TREATMENT PLANS AND MEDICAL BILLING CODES WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH A PHYSICIAN OR MEDICAL PROVIDER. SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN PROHIBITS SUCH CHANGES WITHOUT FIRST CONSULTING WITH A PHYSICIAN OR PHYSICAL THERAPIST. ATTHIS TIME -- WOULD LIKE TO ASK A DOCTOR RICH A RICK KATZ CHAIR OF THE PAYMENT POLICY COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. AND STEVE -- CATOLICA WITH THE INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL THERAPIST OF CALIFORNIA TO TESTIFY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN JENNER HELL WITNESSES SUPPORT. THANK YOU CENTER HEALTH. APPRECIATE THE INTRODUCTION ON THE BILL -- MY NAME IS RICK KATIMA DOCTOR PHYSICAL THERAPY AND A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. I'M ALSO A BUSINESS OWNER FOR A PHYSICAL THERAPY CLINICS IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT CORRECT LOOP HOLES IN IT THE EXISTING LAWS. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SB EIGHT SIXTY THREE ONE A LONG WAY TOWARDS. CORRECT IN ISSUES WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S OFFICIAL MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE AND ENCOURAGING PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO RE ENTER THE MARKET AND PROVIDE QUALITY OF CARE TO THE INJURED WORKER. CALIFORNIA ADOPTED THE WIDELY USED OUR B. R. B. S. SYSTEM AND ALSO ADOPTED THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OCCUPATIONAL BY MENTAL MEDICINE GUIDELINES WHICH ESTABLISHED PARAMETERS FOR DETERMINING MEDICAL NECESSITY AND APPROPRIATE REALIZATION. HOWEVER OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN AN INFLUX OF ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY CREATE NARAL NETWORKS THE RESULT IN CARE BEING DRIVEN TO THE LOWEST COST PROVIDER SNL ILLUSTRATED. AND WITH WITHOUT REGARD TO THE QUALITY OF CARE. THESE DISCOUNTS HAD DRIVEN THE MARKET DOWN TO A POINT WHERE PROVIDERS ARE ONCE AGAIN DISCOURAGED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE WORKERS COMP ARENA. IN ADDITION THESE ENTITIES WHICH OUT CALL MIDDLEMAN OR THIRD PARTY PARTY NON ACCREDITED UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT COMPANIES CONSISTENTLY INTERFERE WITH THE TREATMENT PLAN DEVELOPED BY THE TREATING PHYSICIAN. AND PHYSICAL THERAPIST THE SETTING ASIDE THE STATE ADOPTED A CALM GUIDELINES. NETWORKS ARE ACTUALLY LISTED AS THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL THERAPIST INSTEAD OF THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST THEMSELVES ON THE N. P. AND DIRECTORIES ELIMINATING THE ABILITY FOR A PHYSICIAN TO SELECT THE DOWNSTREAM PROVIDER OF CHOICE WITHIN THAT NETWORK. NETWORK TRANSPARENCY IN THE PRIVATE INSURANCE. CALIFORNIA STATE LAW BUT DOES NOT EXIST IN WORKERS COPY ON THE LISTING OF THE PHYSICIAN AND A NETWORK. FINALLY THESE NETWORKS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO TAKE BILLS SUBMITTED TO THEM BY PROVIDERS. AND RE PRICE THE CLAIMS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR OWN BOTTOM LINE PROFITS. TO THE PRACTICES OF THESE NETWORKS HAVE GONE AS FAR AS TO PIT ONE PROVIDER AGAINST ANOTHER WITH. WHICH WITH THREATS THAT PATIENTS WILL BE RE DIRECTED TO THE COMPETITOR IF THEY DO NOT ACCEPT LOWER RATES. AND DECREASED THEIR UTILIZATION THESE ACTIVITIES OCCUR WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE EMPLOYER. AND RESULT IN DELAYED ACCESS TO CARE FOR THE INJURED WORKER. THE NETWORK NEGOTIATE THE PRICE OF THE CARRIER THAN DISCOUNT SURPRISED TO THE PROVIDER AND KEEP THE SPREAD. DRIVING DOWN THE PRICE TO PROVIDE. TO THE PROVIDER ONLY BENEFITS THAT MIDDLEMAN ENTITY AND ADDS NO VALUE TO THE EMPLOYER OR THE INJURED WORKER AND DELAYED ACCESS TO CARE IS PROVEN TO RESULT IN HIGHER HEALTHCARE EMPLOYER DANITY COSTS. SO THESE PRACTICES RESULT IN IN A FEDERAL LAWSUIT WHICH MISTER KIND OF CALL AGAIN -- ELABORATE ON BETWEEN INDEPENDENT GROUP OF PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND ONE SUCH ENTITY THAT EXPOSED A WEAKNESS THE CALIFORNIA LAWS. THE LAWSUIT RESULTED IN A SETTLEMENT TO CURTAIL SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES OF ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES FOR DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME BUT DID NOTHING TO STOP OTHERS FROM FOLLOWING THE SAME PRACTICES. SO ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF FIVE THIRTY SEVEN IS TO CURTAIL THESE BAD BEHAVIORS REINFORCE EXISTING LAW WORK IS NEEDED. IT ALSO PROMOTES THE ABILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE D. I. R. TO EXERCISE THEIR AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT. SO WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR HILL FOR HIS ADDRESSING THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES ENERGY TO SUPPORT. SUPPORT. FIVE THIRTY SEVEN SENATOR SAYS STEVE CATHOLIQUE I REPRESENT IN. INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS OF CALIFORNIA -- ORGANIZATION IS COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED PHYSICAL THERAPY PRACTICES IN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED LOCATIONS IN THE PROVIDE CARE -- TO ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW PATIENTS EVERY EVERY YEAR. I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS AUTHORSHIP OF FIVE SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN AS WELL AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS PASSAGE. AMONG ITS IMPORTANT PROVISIONS SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THE LEGISLATURE'S AND ORIGINAL INTENT. WHEN PASSING SB EIGHT SIXTY THREE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND SB ELEVEN SIXTY IN? TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN REINFORCES THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT. IN EIGHT SIXTY THREE THAT ALL MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYERS WHO PAY THEIR BILLS. HAVE AN EFFICIENT METHOD TO RESOLVE REIMBURSEMENT DISPUTE. SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN ASSURE CITY INDEPENDENT BILL REVIEW PROCESS CANNOT BE SIDE STEPPED OR ELIMINATED. BY PROVIDER NETWORKS THAT SUBSTITUTE THEIR OWN IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION FOR THE OUT OF THE REAL PROVIDER. ON THE PROVIDERS BILL. THIS NETWORK MANEUVER DISCONNECTS THE REAL PROVIDER FROM THE SECOND BILL REVIEW AN INDEPENDENT BILL REVIEW SYSTEM. SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN REINFORCES THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT WITH SB. ELEVEN SIXTY THAT ONLY THE EMPLOYERS URAC ACCREDITED UTILIZATION REVIEW PROCESS. THE ONE THAT'S REGISTERED WITH THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DELAY DENY OR MODIFY MEDICAL CARE THAT -- AND IT DOES SO BY ASSURING THAT THE PROVIDER NETWORKS CANNOT DELAY OR MODIFYING AUTHORIZATION OF CARE ALREADY OBTAINED BY THE EMPLOYERS ACCREDITED. PLAN. WHY SUCH CLEAR LEGISLATION A LEGISLATIVE INTENT EVEN NEEDING REINFORCEMENT? ON THESE ISSUES ARE ORGANIZATION AS DR KATZ MENTIONED. THE INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS WON A LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST A MAJOR WORKERS COMPENSATION DISCOUNT NETWORK IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT -- PROVIDED. PROVED THAT THE ALLEGATIONS ARE PREDATORY PRICE PRICING IN CONTRACTING. ILLEGAL PATIENTS STEERAGE INTERFERENCE WITH PROVIDER PATIENT RELATIONSHIP EXISTED IN SHORT. THE EROSION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENTION IN ACTING MANY OF THOSE REFORMS. FOR EXAMPLE. YOU MAY REMEMBER IN SB EIGHT SIXTY THREE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW AMERICAN MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION BASED ON THE SAME SCHEDULE USED. FOR THE NATIONAL MEDICARE SYSTEM. THE PURPOSE AND INTENT. WERE WERE TO ESTABLISH A REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM BOTH PREDICTABLE FOR EMPLOYERS. AS WELL AS FAIR TO THE IN MEDICAL PROVIDERS. SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN REINFORCES THAT INTENT BY PREVENTING NETWORKS FROM ARBITRARILY CHANGING BILLING CODES. AND UNBUNDLING PROCEDURES THEREBY INFLATING THE BILL CHARGES. IT ALSO CURTAILS ILLEGAL PREDATORY NETWORK CONTRACTING PRACTICES. THE PRESS PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT RATES SOMETIMES WELL BELOW MEDICARE. WHILE FEE SCHEDULE REIMBURSEMENT AND THE MODIFIED BILL CHARGES GO UP. YOU'VE BEEN PROVIDED WITH THE GRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATES THIS POINT. AFTER PASSAGE OF S. S. B. EIGHT SIXTY THREE AS TIME WENT BY. THE SPREAD BETWEEN CONTRACTED REIMBURSEMENT DEPICTED BY THE FLAT LINE REIMBURSEMENT A TYPICAL SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER VISIT. AND THE RISING OWN FS REIMBURSEMENT INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. TURNOUTS DETECTED BY THE BLUE LINE. EXTRA CASH YOU TO TRY TO WRAP UP JORDAN. I CAN'T. HEAR THE EMPLOYER CONTINUES TO PAY THE UPPER FEE. BUT CERTAINLY THE NETWORK BENEFITS BY THE SPREAD. EVIDENCE IS PRACTICE ALSO WAS PART OF THE RECENT LAWSUIT. WHY WOULD DIE PROVIDERS NEED TO GO TO FEDERAL COURT? SB FIVE SIXTY THREE ASSURES THAT INJURED WORKERS WELL I WILL NOT HAVE -- TO BE PUT THROUGH THIS. AND IN IN ADDITION IS DR KATZ MENTIONED WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH CLEAR A CLEAR CHOICE WHEN -- ASKING FOR PROVIDERS OUT OF THE NETWORK. SB FIVE THIRTY SIX PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S INJURED WORKERS BY PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY. PERMANENTLY FIXING PREDATORY PRICING -- SCHEMES AND INSURING APPROPRIATE YOU ARE PROCESSES. I COULD GO ON I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU WE HAVE QUESTIONS I'M SURE WE WILL ASK THEM AND I I BELIEVE THERE'S NO FORMAL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SO I THINK YOU'RE IN GOOD SHAPE. AT OTHER WITNESSES AND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ANY WITNESSES OUT ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. RULES THE TAIL AT THEIR THE BEST THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED -- CENTER HELLO. AND I WILL MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ADAM SECRETARY THE BILL'S BEEN DISS SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN BUILT A NEW BY SIR MITCHELL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS HELLO HI PHIL HI MORALE. JACKSON. MITCHELL FIVE I PATH I HAVE A GOOD MORNING AGAIN WE ARE MOVING TO ITEM NUMBER. THREE FOUR THIRTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE COMMITTEES. I MENTIONED CAN THINK THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THE FILM FOUR THIRTY TELL THE CORRECTION NAM IN THAT AS TO MY KNOWLEDGE AFFECTS ONLY NINE JUDGES. THESE NINE JUDGES CAME FROM PRIVATE PRACTICE AND FILED RAN AND WON THE RESPECTIVE OFFICES AND IN TWENTY TWELVE MOST OF THEM ONE IN JUNE BEFORE WE ENACTED. TRACK CHANGES. THEN THEY GOT ELECTED IN NOVEMBER AND THEN THEY DIDN'T GETS WELLNESS ONE UNTIL JANUARY THEY WERE UNABLE TO BE SWORN IN BEFORE JANUARY. TWENTY THIRTEEN FOR FOR PENSION PURPOSES AND THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED DIFFER PENSION PURPOSE THEY'VE BEEN TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OTHER JUDGES WHO WERE POINTED IN TWENTY TWELVE BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE. BEEN COMING IN FROM THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS PRIVATE SECTOR. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES PENSION REFORM ACT KNOWN AS PEPPER ON WOULDN'T AFFECT AND THAT AND JANUARY ONE AND THEREFORE THEY MIX MR DEADLINES THIS BILL SIMPLY. REQUIRES AN EQUALIZATION OF THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE JUDGES RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR THESE FOR A NEW JUDGES BUT THIS CHANGE -- APPROXIMATELY DOUBLE THE JUDGES CONTRIBUTION THESE NINE JUDGES AND THEIR RETIREMENT SYSTEM FROM A PERCENT SB FOUR THIRTY CLARIFY SAID THESE NINE JUDGES AND THIS IS ONLY THESE NINE JUDGES THIS IS NOT. THAT CAN'T MULLIN THE TENT ANALOGY. WHO WERE ELECTED DURING TWENTY TWELVE BUT NOT TAKING OFFICE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN ARE NOT NEW JUDGES AS SET FORTH IN THE AN ANALYSIS FOR PURPOSES OF THE JUDGES RETIREMENT SSTEM? THE STANDARDIZES THE TREATMENT ALL JUDGES ELECTED AND OR POINTER DURING. TO TWENTY TWELVE FOR PURPOSES OF PEPPER AND WITH YOUR HAVE MY BLOOD ON BEHALF OF THE TEXAS ASSOCIATION. RETURN MEMBERS THANK YOU. MIKE FOLLOWED ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION I KNOW MEANT ALL OF THE MEMBERS HERE. MAY REFER. IN A VETO BY GOT THEN GOVERNOR BROWN WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT IT WAS CHIPPING AWAY AT PEPPER. WE SIMPLY THOUGHT IT WAS A EQUITABLE A CLARIFICATION THAT EVERYONE ALAC DID OR APPOINTED IN. TWENTY TWELVE WAS SUBJECT TO THE OLD RULES I THINK THAT THE ANALYSIS IS VERY FAIR AND RAISING THE ISSUES AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT PENSIONS ARE. SENSITIVE AND THAT YOU HAVE A REAL DUTY TO THE PEOPLE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT PENSION ISSUES -- AS CENTER WHAT KOWSKI NOTED THERE THIS IS AN ANOMALY. THIS IS THE ONLY GROUP THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT HAS TO PASS THIS TO OTHER POSITION MOST JUDGES TAKE OFFICE BY APPOINTMENT. AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE APPOINTED IN TWENTY TWELVE TOOK OFFICE IN. TWENTY IT IS THESE FEW PEOPLE WHO WERE ELECTED AND BY THE WAY ELECTION -- TO JUDGESHIPS HAS BEEN THE PATH IT'S AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR SYSTEM IT HAS BEEN THE PATH. WHERE PEOPLE OF UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS? THE OTHER PARTY PUBLIC DEFENDERS HAVE ACHIEVED JUDGESHIPS BY ELECTIONS WHEN THEY OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BUT THESE FEW PEOPLE. COULDN'T TAKE OFFICE UNTIL THE FIRST MONDAY OF JANUARY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO VACANCY UNTIL THEN SELL THE LEGISLATURE I BELIEVE -- APPROPRIATELY DECIDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT IT WAS FAIR TO TREAT THEM UNDER THE LAW THAT EXISTED WHEN THEY FILE FOR OFFICE RAN FOR OFFICE AND WON THE OFFICE WHEN THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT PEPPER. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE A UNIQUE CASE BECAUSE OF THE APPOINTMENT ELECTION -- PARADOX SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS -- AND WOULD ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU MISTER BELOW OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. VERY GOOD WHY IS IT DIDN'T SET IT QUESTIONS ABOUT YES MITCHELL AND ANSWERED. MY THANK YOU SARAH KOWSKI -- FOR A PRESENTATION. IS THAT RIGHT YEAH A STE STILL HAVE I I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- SO I RECOGNIZE THIS IS A SOMEWHAT YOU THE CASE FOR A VERY. NARROW NUMBER -- WHICH DATE. WHAT ELECTION CYCLE WHERE THESE JUDGES ELECTED TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY TWELVE AND? AT NOVEMBER RIGHT A JUNE AND A FRIEND WERE SPOTTED OUT HERE. VIRTUALLY ALL WERE ELECTED IN JUNE THERE WAS A COUPLE THAT WENT TO RUN OFF OKAY -- YEAH AND IT'S IT'S A SMALL NUMBER BUT AS SOMEONE WHO YOU KNOW IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN -- MONITORING AND WHICH AND FIGHTING TO BE SURE WE PROTECT OUR PENSION -- PROMISES TO PLAYS AND AND EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. TO TO ENSURE THE UNDER MY REALIZE IS A SMALL GROUP ADDRESS ACTIVE YOU KNOW -- BUT I AT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY PASS UP FOR A THAT THAT TIME DID NOT SPECIFICALLY MAKE ANY EXEMPTION AYE AND SENT TO THE NOW SISTERS OF THE LAWSUIT THAT'S ON GOING I MEAN DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING -- WE'RE LAWMAKERS -- BUT AT YEAH I AM I'VE MET HIM KNOW TO TO MAKE A SERVICES. I MEAN EXEMPTIONS ARE EXEMPTION RIGHT AND SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW I I I AM ABLE TO AT LEAST VOTE FOR THE BILL AT THIS TIME I THINK THE THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT BY BY ACTUALLY TAKING AN EXEMPTION GIVEN. EXCEPTION TO TIP WE'VE. OVERTURNING. THOSE OF US IN LOSS SIDE OF IT VERSUS OVERTURNING AYE AYE CASE AND JUST SAYING NO THIS IS A CLARIFICATION -- THE TREATMENT OF THESE FOLKS IT'S YOU CAN'T HARPER. I KNOW WELL. HI THIS OTHER THAN SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE SWORN IN JANUARY. THE DISK MOST WAS THE PEOPLE IT WAS FAIR AGAIN AYE AYE WE WERE HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE AND WE WERE DEBATING THIS AFTER THEY HAD WON THE ELECTION. THEY WANT THEIR ELECTION THEY WERE REYES TAKE SEE THEM WE SAY OH NO WE'RE CHANGING THE RULES SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW IT'S IT'S FOR THE BELT. AS WE CAN DISABLE NO THAT'S WOOD CHIPS FELL BUT IT WAS JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF JUDGES. NOT FILLING VACANCIES BY WAY. THERE WERE VACANCIES THAT WERE AVAILABLE THE GOVERNOR WOULD NOT BUILD. THESE WITH THESE PEOPLE THAT ONE SO IS IT A DOUBLE WHAMMY UNDER JUST IN THE WAY THAT THE COURTS TO SEE PEOPLE SO WHICH LOVE YOUR INTEREST IN A LAW FIRM YOU'VE. RESIGNED FROM THE NONPROFIT WHATEVER IT IS IT'S A PARTICULARLY FINAL KINDS OF KIND OF THING THAT PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY WHEN THESE JUDGE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND IN A I I WOULD AGREE WITH THE THE ANALYSIS AND CERTAINLY WITH THE THE COMMENT TO ME THIS IS AN ANOMALY AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT PRESIDENT SETTING. AN ON THE RECORD THAT WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE ELECTION TIMING AND BECAUSE OF WHEN. SOMEONE TAKES OFFICE -- IT DID CREATE A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD HAVE CHANGED THEIR MIND AFTER THE ELECTION AND AN HOUR AFTER PREPARA BUT THE POINT IS THAT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL DEAL AND WE'VE WE'VE. KIND OF DONE THAT WITH ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T CHANGE THE RULES AFTER -- FOR RETIREMENT AND WE'VE WE'VE NOT DONE THAT AND IN MANY CASES SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S AN HONEST AND AND FAIR. APPROACH AND AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT INDIVIDUALS AND AND YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR. SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU THAT THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE ELECTION WAS PRIOR TO THE THE EPUB OF MEANINGFUL VIA COME INTO PLAY ARE BECOMING LAW. AND I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE THING TO DO SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM A SENATOR MITCHELL DIRECTOR LEVEL CLOSE IN NO WE DO WE WANT TO SPEAK. PRESIDENT'S HEADING FOR ANY OTHER SORT OF SUCH AS STATE -- EMPLOYEE AND IT'S NARROWLY TAILORED WE WE BELIEVE -- TO PROVIDE SOME FAIRNESS IS A NON ANOMALY THAT HAS OCCURRED AND I URGE AND I BOTH.

THIS ONE'S HAVING -- THIS IS THE IT'S A BILL ABOUT. WORKERS COMPENSATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE DIGEST WILL TELL YOU -- THIS IS ABOUT AT TOUGH MATERIAL THAT -- PEOPLE DON'T OFTEN LIKE TO TALK ABOUT -- WE ARE SEEING SUICIDE RATES AMONG FIRST RESPONDERS WRIT LARGE EXCEEDING -- YES ON THE FRONT LINES THEMSELVES WE'RE TALKING A VERY DANGEROUS JOBS TODAY AMONG PEACE OFFICERS WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL KINDS OF TRAUMA -- NOT JUST THE THE THE WILD FIRES AND THE SORT OF STRESSORS THAT ARE RIGHT IN OUR FACES BUT EVEN. THE DAILY TRAGEDIES THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH AS A POLICE OFFICER OR FIREFIGHTER WHEN. KID GETS KILLED ON THE STREET AND WHAT IT'S LIKE. A YOUNG MAN OFF OF SIDEWALK WHO'S BEEN HIT BY A CAR LIKE IT WAS THE OTHER DAY A BICYCLIST IN. KOREA TOWN OR IN YOUR DISTRICT -- YOU KNOW THE FOLKS WHO WENT UP AND FOUGHT THAT CAMPFIRE FOR MONTHS ON END IN ITS IT. THIS BILL IS DESIGNED -- TO REARRANGE OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM I THINK THE ANALYSIS FAIRLY POINTS OUT THAT THIS DOES PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE. OF BY SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING TO PRESUME. IF YOU ARE PEACE OFFICER -- WHO IS REPORTING A POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS INJURY? THAT OUR PRESUMPTION IS THAT WE BELIEVE. AND THAT THAT RESENT THE PRESUMPTION IS REBUTTABLE. BUT THAT THE LEVEL OF COURAGE IN THE CURRENT DETERRENT. OUT THERE BUILT INTO THE CULTURE AROUND THIS KIND OF WORK. IMPEDE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO STEP UP AND SHARE THE STORIES THAT YOU HEAR. SOME OF TODAY -- HAVING TO PROVE YOUR CASE AND HAVING THE BURDEN ON YOU. TO SAY THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA THAT I'M HAVING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS THAT I'M GOING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT -- MAKES IT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NOT A LOT OF FOLKS WANT TO ADMIT. AND THAT'S CAUSING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WE FEEL LIKE WITHIN OUR RANKS -- AND WE'RE SEEING IT IT'S IT'S BEEN INTIMATELY KNOWN TO ME YOU KNOW. THAT. PARENTS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE TAKING THEIR OWN LIVES KITTEN VENTURA COUNTY IT ABOUT A MONTH OR TWO AGO -- YOU KNOW THIS IS GOTTEN PERSONAL SO I'LL I'LL STEP OUT OF THE WAY AND I I DO WANT TO ENGAGE IN THE POLICY ISSUES HERE BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE IMPORTANT ONES I DO APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS BUT RATHER THAN BELABOR THIS. I'LL JUST SAY -- IT IS SAID IT IS JUST THAT IT IS A THUMB ON THE SCALE WE ARE AS A LEGISLATURE WITH THIS BILL SAYING. IF YOUR SAYING YOU'VE GONE THROUGH PTS AYE. THE PRESUMPTION OUGHT TO BE WITH YOU AND THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO PAY THAT PRICE AND WE OUGHT TO STEP UP AND PAY THAT PRICE IS STATE. BECAUSE OF WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO THIS EVERY DAY SO AS FOR RIVAL. SENATOR STERN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SIR ORNING MR CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY BOMB ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS.

STOP DOING OUR JOB AND WE CAN'T START HAVE IN AN ABNORMAL RESPONSE TO THOSE ABNORMAL SITUATIONS. SO WE NEED OUR HELP FOR OUR FRONTLINE GUYS. OUR MEN AND WOMEN ARE BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT ARE LIVING WITH PTS I BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED. THERE ARE MORE FIREFIGHTERS CHOOSING SUICIDE AS THEIR BEST OPTION. THEN THE LINE OF DUTY DEATHS AND THAT IS NOT. RIGHT. WE NEED TO GET TREATMENT AND CARE FOR OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS GET THEM ACCESS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER WITNESSES. MISTER CHAIRMAN A CENTERS GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS TIM THOMAS I'M A POLICE OFFICER FOR THE LARGEST POLICE DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M A MEMBER OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE. I'M ALSO A PEER SUPPORT MEMBER FOR MY DEPARTMENT. AND I ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING -- FOR FOUNDATIONS THAT DIRECTLY ASSIST BOTH OUR COMBAT VETERANS OUR FIRST RESPONDERS SPECIFICALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AS THEY MAKE EVERY ATTEMPT TO TRY NOT TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THROUGH MY WORK. WITH POLICE OFFICERS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BOTH IN MY DEPARTMENT AND AROUND THIS COUNTRY. THAT MENTAL ILLNESS AMONGST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IS ABSOLUTELY REAL. WITHOUT QUESTION IT IS REAL AND THE CHANCE FOR SUICIDE AMONGST THOSE NUMBERS. IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE ON A DAILY BASIS. AS I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THIS BILL LIKE I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION. THAT REALLY IT'S ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS IT'S ABOUT NUMBER ONE IS ABOUT IT. TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF OUR PEOPLE. I NUMBER TWO IT'S HELPING US ASSIST IN OUR MOVEMENT FOR NATIONAL AWARENESS TO BREAK THIS DID DIGNA. THE DEADLY STIGMA THAT'S ATTACHED TO MENTAL ILLNESS IN THIS COUNTRY. AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FIRST RESPONDERS OF COURSE THAT'S OUR JOB WE ARRIVE AT THE SCENE OF SOMETIMES HORRIFIC AND TRAGIC EVENTS. AND WE ARE CALLED UPON TO ACT QUICKLY. AND MOVE FORWARD. AS WAS WITNESSED DURING THE THE FIRES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WERE BRAVE FIREFIGHTERS MOVED AND ATTACK THOSE BUYERS HEAD ON SAVING. HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTY AND MORE POORLY SAVING LIVES. ARE PARADISE CALIFORNIA WHERE THOSE LAWS WITH THOSE FIRES RAGED OUT OF CONTROL OUR BRAVE FIREFIGHTERS MOVED TOWARD THOSE FIRES INTO THE CARNAGE THE WRECKAGE. AND THE LOSS OF LIFE TO SEE FIRSTHAND. AT THE BORDERLINE. NIGHTCLUB IN THOUSAND OAKS CALIFORNIA WHEN TRAGEDY STRUCK AND BULLETS WERE FLYING ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. MOVED TOWARD THOSE BULLETS SELFLESSLY. COURAGEOUSLY RISKING THEIR OWN LIFE. AND THE CASE OF SERGEANT HE LISTS FROM THE VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT GIVING HIS OWN LIFE IN ORDER TO SAVE OTHERS. THIS IS A REAL DEAL THE THINGS THAT WE SEE ON A DAILY BASIS. IS NOT NORMAL [inaudible] AND WE IF WE'RE LUCKY AND WE'RE GRACED BY GOD WE GET TO GO HOME AT THE END OF THE NIGHT WE GET TO KISS OUR FAMILY OR WIFE OR CHILDREN AND WE SUCCESSFULLY ONCE AGAIN COMPARTMENTALIZE WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH ON THAT DAY THE IMPACT [inaudible] EMOTIONAL IMPACT [inaudible] IS PALPABLE. THE THE MENTAL AND STE TO STRAIN IS. COLLABORATIVE A WAY I MEAN IT WORKS. THE ROUTE THAT YOU THROUGHOUT THE YEARS DAY AFTER DAY MONTH AFTER MONTH YEAR AFTER YEAR. IT CAN BREAK DOWN EVEN THE HARDEST THE STRONGEST. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHO BECAME A FRIEND HE WAS MY TRAINING OFFICER YOUNG IN MY CAREER. AND THIS GUY WAS A ROBUST STE JUST MY EIGHTY MANDATE MANTA MANTA HUNTER OF FISHERMEN AND AN UNBELIEVABLE POLICE OFFICER AND MENTOR. AND THROUGH THE COURSE OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM WE WERE ABLE TO GARNER A RELATIONSHIP AND HE I ASSISTED HIM IN MANY ISSUES THAT HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE BEFORE BECOMING A POLICE OFFICER. WHAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO WAS TO ASSIST HIM WHEN HE NEEDED HELP THE MOST? AND MY FRIEND HIS OWN LIFE. HE WAS AFRAID. TO REACH OUT FOR HELP BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA. HE WAS AFRAID TO REACH OUT FOR HELP BECAUSE THE CULTURE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ESPECIALLY IN FIRST RESPOND OR STATES THAT IF YOU ASK FOR HELP YOU OR YOUR DEEMED WEEK. THAT VULNERABILITIES WEAKNESS WHEN IN FACT IT IS NOT. EARLY IN MY IN EARLY IN MY CAREER I RESPONDED TO A TRAFFIC COLLISION THAT STICKS WITH ME ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS YOUNG GIRLS. IN THE BACK OF THAT VEHICLE AS I RESPOND I CAN SEE THEIR FACE RIGHT NOW. HERE TODAY THERE IS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS MY DAUGHTERS ARE TODAY. AND BECAUSE I'M ABLE. TO COMPLY COMPARTMENTALIZE A DEAL WITH THIS. IN WAYS THAT I'VE LEARNED HOW TO DO MOST POLICE OFFICERS DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY. THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PRO PRO ACTIVE LEAGUE FOUND -- THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE BY SUICIDE. THEN WHILE IN THE LINE OF DUTY IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. AND THIS BILL IS LESS ABOUT THE NUMBERS. AND IT'S MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND THIS. IT'S GOING TO HELP. DROPPED THE STIGMA. OF OF OF MENTAL ILLNESS IN THIS COUNTRY. AS GOING TO HELP THE PEOPLE THAT DALY HELP US ON EVERY SINGLE DAY. SAVE OUR LIVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING [inaudible] YOUR YOUR HISTORY. REYES OF YOUR LIFE TO OUR VERY IMPACTFUL SO THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THREE YEAH MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AARON READ REPRESENTING CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HIGH WITH OLEMAN. A CALIPHATE OR LOCAL TONY EIGHTY ONE AND POOR HACK -- I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR OVER FOUR DECADES. AND I'VE SEEN THIS FRONT AND CENTER WITH THE MEMBERS AS I TRAVEL THE STATE I'VE MET WITH THOUSANDS OF THEM OVER THERE WAS FORTY YEARS. AND AS THE WITNESSES ARE ALL CORRECT THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MACHO THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THEIR JOB NEVER COMPLAIN AND BE INVINCIBLE. AT AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE SUICIDE RATES ARE VERY HIGH I WOULD PATROL HAS HAD OVER A TWO DOZEN SUICIDES. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS -- SOMETHING WE NEVER TALK ABOUT. OKAY AND BUT IT'S THERE -- THE STRESSES OF THE JOBS THE CARNAGE THAT THEY SEE I WOULD PATROL USED HAVE A MAGAZINE. AND THEY WOULD PUBLISH ACCIDENT PHOTOS AND IT JUST GOT SO TERRIBLE THEY JUST STOP THE MAGAZINE. THEY STILL HAVE TO DO THE PHOTOS AND WHAT HEY SEE THOSE IMAGES JUST LIKE HE SAID ABOUT THE KIDS. IN THAT CASE OF THE HOW TO OFFICERS THEY SEE THAT ALMOST EVERY DAY IN THOSE IMAGES NEVER LEAVE. PARTICULARLY KIDS. IT'S SO MUCH SO THAT THE HIGHWAY PATROL ASSOCIATION ESTABLISHED. AN ORGANIZATION CALLED IMPACT TEEN DRIVERS THEY'VE RAISED AND SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON TRYING TO EDUCATE KIDS ON THE DANGERS OF DISTRACTED DRIVING. EVERY BILL THAT'S IN THE LEGISLATURE ON DISTRACTED DRIVING HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BECAUSE THE CARNAGE OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. IS JUST HORRIFIC IN THE SCENES THAT THEY SEE NEVER LEAVE HIM CAL FIRE. FOR EXAMPLE THE PARADISE FIRE. IF YOU WENT UP THERE IT'S LIKE A MOONSCAPE. AND AND THEIR DEAD BODIES AND THEY SEE THAT AND IT NEVER LEAVES IT NEVER LEAVES AND THEY SEE ALL THESE. THERE WAS A WORST FIRE IN HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA BUT THERE'S BEEN IN MANY MANY MORE ALMOST AS BAD IN YOUR DISTRICT THERE WERE MANY. BUYERS -- SAME WITH SANTA ROSA. ALL OVER THE STATE FRANKLY SO IT'S IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE IT'S ONE THAT WE WERE RELUCTANT TO TALK ABOUT PUBLICLY BUT IT'S TIME. IT'S TIME. SO THANK YOU TO SENATOR STERN FOR CARRYING THIS MOST IMPORTANT BILL AND WE'RE PLEASED TO BE CO SPONSORS THANK YOU TO READ.

A MISTER CHAMBERS MATTHEW CYBERLINK ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFF'S A TO APPLAUD THE TREMENDOUS COURAGE THE WITNESSES HERE TODAY THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE AND URGENT EITHER THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHEN MEMBER'S NAME ONLY BE DRAWN WITH MAKE YOU CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.

GORDON ALSO WITH THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE ALSO SUPPORT THANK YOU. AS CHAIR RANGER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE MORNING BRIAN RICE PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS BILL DOES IT IDENTIFIES A MENTAL HEALTH. BUT MORE THAN THAT BY IDENTIFYING IT. IT GIVES FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AWAY TO SEEK TREATMENT FOR IT. THAT WILL LEAD TO HEALING AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY WANT TO LEAVE WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT. PTS I WITH TREATMENT YOU CAN HEAL FROM IT. AND YOU CAN GO BACK TO WORK AND IT IT IT IS NOT. A DEATH SENTENCE IT'S A TREATABLE INJURY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH VOTE. IS SENATOR STERN THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NO ONE NOW IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] FEELING [inaudible] TO PLEASE [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] OKAY -- GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FAITH FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IS WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHORS RECOGNITION OF THE HONOR AND DISTINCTION IN WHICH PEACE OFFICERS SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE RECOGNIZE THE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT THESE OFFICERS MAY. ENCOUNTER BUT WE ARE HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION OF SB. FIVE FORTY TWO THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM PROVIDES GENEROUS BENEFITS THE PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL WHO WERE INJURED DURING THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. IN THESE BENEFITS INCLUDE PRESUMPTIONS FOR ILLNESSES LIKE CANCER AND HEART DISEASE THAT ARE PRESUMED UNDER LAW TO BE WORK RELATED WITHOUT ANY NEED FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO DEMONSTRATE WORK CAUSATION. OUR GOAL IS PUBLIC EMPLOYERS IS TO HELP OUR INJURED EMPLOYEES RECEIVE APPROPRIATE EVIDENCE BASED MEDICAL CARE AND TO HELP THEM RETURN TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TAKE OUR DUTY SERIOUSLY TO ENSURE THAT ALL WORKERS HAVE APPROPRIATE BENEFITS AND COMPENSATION AND WE ARE AWARE OF NO EVIDENCE THAT THESE CLAIMS ARE BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY OR OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LABOR CLOSE. LABOR CODE WHICH REQUIRES STATUTES TO BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED TO THE BENEFIT OF INJURED WORKERS. IN FACT A PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF INTERNAL DATA INDICATES THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PSYCHIATRIC CLAIMS ARE APPROVED. WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL AS WRITTEN. BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THAT THE PSYCHIATRIC INJURY DOES NOT NEED TO BE PREDOMINATELY CAUSED BY EMPLOYMENT. AT ALLOWS NO CONSIDERATION OF NON INDUSTRIAL FACTORS IT'S WRECKED YOUR ACTIVE REQUIRING PUBLIC ENTITIES TO MAKE LARGE PAYMENTS THAT WERE UNEXPECTED AND NOT RESERVED. FOR AN AUTOMATIC ACCEPTANCE OF CLAIMS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DENIED. THE INJURIES ARE NOT LIMITED TO PTSD AND IT APPLIES TO ANY MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER IT INCLUDES VOLUNTEERS IT CAN BE BROUGHT UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER EMPLOYMENT. IT ALLOWS FOR GENEROUS BENEFITS WITHOUT A MINIMUM DURATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND WITHOUT OCCURRENCE OF THE SIGNIFICANT EVENT. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH THE AUTHOR IN WITH THIS COMMITTEE ON A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT ELIGIBILITY THAT EXAMINES THE COST IMPACTS THAT SUCH CHANGES WOULD HAVE ON INJURED WORKERS. AND A LOCAL BUDGETS WHICH ARE REALITY FOR HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT AT THIS TIME WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. VERY MUCH MORNING MORNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE -- MY NAME'S JASON SCHMELZER WHICH I GET RANCH WE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND SEE SACK ACCESS INSURANCE AUTHORITY. I'M AT THE OUTSET WE MAKE CLEAR WE HAVE NO ARGUMENT WITH REALITY I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO EVERYBODY THAT POLICE AND FIRE BRIEFLY FACE SOME OF THE MOST HORRIBLE SITUATIONS THAT OCCUR IN OUR STATE EVERY DAY -- SOUPS WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ARGUMENT WITH THAT -- CONTENTION. I'M ALSO TO SPEAK I REALLY QUICKLY IF I CAN'T TO THE STIGMA AND CULTURE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED -- I KNOW MY ASSOCIATIONS MY CLIENTS TO BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH SENATOR STERN ON ISSUES SURROUNDING STIGMA AND CULTURE BUT WITH RESPECT TO SB. FIVE FORTY TWO AS ABOUT THE OPERATION OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. KIND OF IN A IN A RATHER MUNDANE INSURANCE. TERMS -- SO THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO FOCUS. VERY SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT PRESUMPTIONS AND THE ANALYSIS POINTS THIS OUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE LIKE TO LOOK AT IS WHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EXISTING WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM HOW IS THE SYSTEM TREATING THE WORKERS -- FOR WHICH THE PRESUMPTION WOULD APPLY. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS SO THOROUGHLY STUDY THERE IS NO DATA OUT THERE. THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THESE SPECIFIC TYPES OF CLAIMS FOR THESE SPECIFIC TYPES OF WORKERS ARE PROBLEM IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IF THAT DATA WERE TO ARISE WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO EXAMINE IT AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION MORE CLEARLY BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT IT SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION OBVIOUSLY BECOMES WHY DO WHY DO WE CARE WHY DOES IT. WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS ALREADY SAID WHY IS THE DATA MATTER. AND AGAIN THE THE ANALYSIS DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB YOU'RE POINTING OUT -- SOME KEY FACTORS THIS REALLY IS -- A DEPARTURE FROM THE SORT OF GRAND BARGAIN THAT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AGREE TO IT BEGINNING AT THE SYSTEM IS KIND OF THE UNDERPINNING OF THE ENTIRE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM THIS EVIDENTIARY STANDARD THAT WE WE WE AGREE -- TO AND SECOND THE THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT PSYCHIATRIC THAT CURRENT LAW ON PSYCHIATRIC INJURIES EXISTS -- BECAUSE THERE WAS WELL DOCUMENTED FRAUD AND THE CLAIMS ARE A MAJOR COST DRIVER EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE FILED WHEN THE INJURY WAS LARGELY DUE TO NON OCCUPATIONAL INJURY. INJURIES ARE FACTORS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MATTERS IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT WE NEED TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. TO WE HAVE THE ABILITY VERY CLEARLY IN THE SYSTEM TO MAKE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS -- SOME OF THE BEST REFORMS THAT WE'VE SEEN FOR THE TRENDS TOWARDS REFORM OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS HAVE REALLY BEEN ON EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES GETTING TOGETHER. AND MAKING WISE DECISIONS BASED ON DATA I THINK WITH RESPECT TO YOU SB FIVE FORTY TWO WE'D LIKE TO OPERATE ON THAT SAME LEVEL WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH -- THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL IN THE SENATOR -- AND SEE WHERE WE ARE THERE'S THE COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION WHICH IS A JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT -- THE COMMISSION THEY CAN EVALUATE THESE ISSUES AND WE'VE RESPECTFULLY THINK THAT THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE KEPT THERE FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION. I CONSIDERATION BUT AS IT STANDS RIGHT WE HAVE TO RETURN OF OF TODAY. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. COME FORWARD AND MORNING. GOOD MORNING JOSH DUGGAR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND ALSO TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION AND THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. ALL IN OPPOSED FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION SEE NO ONE OF BRINGING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR DISCUSSION FROM COMMENTS -- I DID YOU HAVE SOME COMMITTED. I YOU KNOW IT'S YEAH THIS IS ONE OF TOSE THE BILL THE FIRST SAID SENATOR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN. BRINGING THIS -- THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE FORWARD I YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE I WAS FRANKLY TORN WHEN I READ THE INTERNET THAN ANALYSIS AND AND LISTEN TO THIS BECAUSE THE YOU KNOW WE ASK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FROM A PEACE OFFICERS IN FACT. YOU KNOW I MEAN THIS IS SUCH A MINOR THING BUT NOT NOT MINOR BUT AS I WAS DRIVING IN. FROM THE BAY AREA ON MONDAY MORNING I'VE WITNESSED THE ACCIDENT ON ADDICTION AWARE OF PERSON GOT OUT OF HIS TRUCK COULDN'T LOST HIS LADDER AND FROM A PICKUP. IT WAS IN THIS THE THE I GUESS NUMBER THREE LANE OR TWO LANE AND AND THE FLOW LANE. HE RAN UP. TO GET THE LETTER AND HE WAS HIT BY A CAR AND IS I DO A BY THE EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO WORK WORK ON HIM ON THE STREET AND HE DIED. SO IT'S IT'S IT EVEN AFFECTS. YOU KNOW A LAYMAN WHO DRIVES BY AND SEES A BODY ON THE GROUND -- AND HOW THAT BODY IS CONFIGURED CONTORTED IN IN SOME WAYS IS. IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DO. YOU REMEMBER AND IT DOES HAVE IT CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON ON ON ANYONE BUT MUCH LESS WHEN SOMEONE SEES IT ON  REGULAR BASIS AND HOW YOU HAVE -- TO YOU CAN NEVER GET I THINK HARDEN TO THAT -- AND AND IT IS -- A TERRIBLE A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE -- FOR FOR ANYONE AND IN OUR PEACE OFFICER SHE IT. FIREFIGHTERS ALL THE TIME -- AND EVERY DAY -- AND AND GETTING THAT METAL THOSE MENTAL HEALTH. RESOURCES TO THEM IS IS CRITICAL I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT BUT I DID LEARN SOMETHING IN THE HEARING TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS. RELATED. TO THE ISSUE OF THE PRESUMPTION DOES. DO SOMETHING. TO ALIGN IT WITH. YOU KNOW THIS IS A POSSIBILITY THIS IS A A THE AFFECT OF YOUR PROFESSION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN COME FROM. YOUR PROFESSION -- AND THAT IT IS. IT'S IT'S NOT AN UNNATURAL FOR THAT TO OCCUR AND SO I THAT STIGMA IN IN THE CULTURE CHANGE I THINK. I THINK THE PRESUMPTION DOES MAKE IT. CAN MAKE IT -- BETTER. EASIER FOR THEM TO SEEK HELP BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO GET THAT THEY ME THE PRESUMPTION DOESN'T GET THE MENTAL HEALTH HELP THEY NEED. TO DO IT BUT IT MAY ALTER THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS IN A BILL IT WITH THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD AND SEEK THAT HELP -- SO I IT IN IN THE OTHER PART. WHICH I'M FINE WITH WITH THE CERTAINLY SUPPORTING THE BILL. TODAY BUT I'M I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHANGES IN THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN THERE -- THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS -- AND I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT THAT -- SOME CALLING C. BUT THAT'S A CONCERN THAT. THAT I HAVE WITH IT AS WELL SO I THINK IT'S IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE -- TO I MEAN THE THE THE LEGISLATION AND MOVING THE OF THE PRESUMPTION I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION [inaudible] CENTER PAN [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE CHAIR HELL -- JUST I I GUESS THE BILL -- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR WORKERS COMP. COSTS AND SO FORTH BUT YEAH HI I'VE SPENT TIME AN EMERGENCY ROOM. AND SO IT'S SO I'M SEEING A FRACTION OF WHAT. RIGHT AND SOMEONE BROUGHT THE PATIENT INTO THE ER. RIGHT. AND LOT AND SO YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE DRIVE THEMSELVES IN BUT THE ONES WHO ARE REALLY SICK ARE REALLY INJURED. RIGHT. GOT BROUGHT IN BY MEMBERS OF FIRE SERVICE. SO THEY SAW WAS LIKE AND FEEL. THAT'S PRETTY DRAMATIC. I BELIEVE AT THAT. I'M OF THE BILL VERY GOOD THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE. TO KNOW FOR THE COMMENTS THE SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THE COMMITTEE YOUR EXPERTS HERE ON HOW TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES BUT AS IT WAS SO APTLY PUT. IT'S TIME IT'S TIME. TO TO PUT THIS THIS TYPE OF INJURY ON A LIST THAT I THINK. IT CERTAINLY BELONGS ON BREAK NOW WE PRESUME ABOUT HEART DISEASE HERNIAS PNEUMONIA MENINGITIS TUBERCULOSIS. IT'S TIME TO START TREATING. MENTAL HEALTH. ILLNESSES OR YOU HAVE THOSE INJURIES AS JUSTICE EQUAL TO ANY OF THOSE OTHER WORKPLACE INJURIES. AND FOLKS NEED TO GET PAST THE FACT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING TO BE ASHAMED OF AND THAT OUGHT TO BE HIDDEN. AND WHAT IT IS TO BE A MAN. WHAT IS TO BE TOUGH -- THIS IS THE YEAR TO START CHANGING THAT. WHILE THE PUBLIC PAYING ATTENTION SO YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT JUST THE FIRES IT'S THOSE WHO GO THROUGH MASS SHOOTINGS LIKE WE HAD BORDERLINE WE HAD AN SAN BERNADINO. THIS IS TOUGH STUFF SO I APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE AND THIS FORTUNE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN -- WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR AND WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE MOTION IS DEPRESSED TO APPROPRIATIONS HILL HI PHIL. MORRELL [inaudible] JACKSON [inaudible] MITCHELL. WE HAVE BOTH TWO VOTES WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR OUR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU THE NO YOU REYES STOOD. THE TRUTH THANK YOU SIR. ONE ONE SIX TWO FOUR ONLY COMES. I'M SORRY THANK YOU WITH SINESTRO THIS IS ITEM NUMBER NINE SB. SEVEN THREE ZERO PLEASE PROCEED THIS VERY GOOD THANK YOU -- SWITCHING. MODES HERE. THE FUTURE OF WORK IS. SOMETHING WE'VE ALL BEEN WRESTLING WITH I THINK FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THIS STATE AS THE PACE OF AUTOMATION -- TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION STARTS A CHALLENGE. OUR SORT OF FUNDAMENTAL NOTIONS OF WHAT IS WORK AND WHAT IS THE WORK OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN GOING TO BE IN THIS STATE -- THE FUNDAMENTAL THESIS IS BILL IS WE JUST DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING. AND THERE'S A LACK OF DATA AND SORT OF CLARITY INTO THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE TENSION POINTS IN THE STATE. THAT IS THE REASON I BRING THE BILL BACK AGAIN THIS YEAR WE RAN SOMETHING SIMILAR LAST YEAR. AND THE GOVERNOR -- ADOPTED SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE FRAMEWORK. STATION NOW -- INTO THE ADMINISTRATION SO HE'S PUT TOGETHER A FUTURE WORK COMMISSION -- WE'RE STILL WAITING ON WHAT THE DETAILS THAT ARE BUT PART OF THIS BILL IS HOW TO HELP SHAPE THAT -- MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PURVIEW INTO THAT PROCESS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALSO GETTING ACCESS TO THAT DATA BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR IN THE WORK FORCE. WITH OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN LABOR -- WHO ARE CONCERNED WE'RE CONTRACTIONS ARE GOING TO OCCUR BUT RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE LABOR STATISTICS AND THOUGH AND THE WORK WE'RE DOING JUST? WERE NOT OUT AHEAD OF IT SO MAKING HE'S DONE SOME AMAZING WORK GLOBALLY BIG SURVEYS WE NEED OUR OWN ASSESSMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK THIS COMMISSION IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BODY TO DO THAT -- AND I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME MARRIAGE HERE TO BE HAD WHERE TECH IN LABOR DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE OPPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY. PUT DATA INTO THE SPOTLIGHT AND TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME ISSUES -- RATHER THAN SIT IN OUR CAMP SO WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY AYE BENJAMINEDDIE. HAVE THE MILKEN INSTITUTE SO THEY'VE BEEN DOING SOME REALLY INTERESTING WORK -- ON THIS ISSUE OF CONVENING VARIOUS CONFERENCES FORM SO WE APPRECIATE THE BRAIN POWER THE THE INS TO BE HERE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE MILKEN INSTITUTE -- WE AT THE MILKEN INSTITUTE IS A NONPROFIT NON PARTISAN THINK TANK WE'VE GOT LOCATIONS. I'M CENTERS IN SANTA MONICA AT LONDON SINGAPORE IN DC JUST SO THAT WE'RE INSURING WE'RE CAPTURING THAT NATIONAL AND GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE ON THESE TYPES OF ISSUES. AND WE CERTAINLY DO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF A STATE COMMISSION DESIGNED TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER DYNAMICS. ON THE FUTURE OF WORK ON OUR CENTER OF REGIONAL -- ECONOMICS HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE FOR VARIOUS YEARS AND WE EVEN HELD A PANEL ON THIS DURING OUR CALIFORNIA SUMMIT LAST AUGUST -- BUT AS THE FUTURE WORK TAKE SHAPE WITH THE AUTOMATION A I N. AS THERE'S GOING TO BE OBVIOUSLY A HIGHER DEMAND -- FOR HIGHER SKILLED WORK FORCE WE BELIEVE THAT AND THIS WILL HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THE STATE AND ON THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND JOBS -- IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE'RE LEVERAGING OUR EXISTING -- PARTNERSHIPS AND CREATING NEW LINKS FOR INDUSTRY AND EDUCATION I'M A COMMON THEME THAT HAS BEEN RESONATING IN OUR WORK IS FINDING THAT -- WORKERS. UP SCALING -- WE FOUND THAT THERE IS AT WORKERS NEED TO BE EQUIPPED WITH SKILLS FOR TECHNOLOGY SIMPLE COMPUTER LITERACY AND ENHANCING TRADITIONAL SKILLS HAS BEEN REALLY -- THE FOCUS HERE SEEING AT GIVEN THE AUTOMATION IS GOING TO BE IMPACTING ABOUT 40% OF ALL JOBS THAT WE SEE TODAY BY. TWENTY FOURTEEN I'M THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEED TO ENSURE THAT WORKERS ARE SORT OF PURSUING CONTINUING EDUCATION AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE. I'M SO IF WE ARE GOING TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE IT'S ESSENTIAL TO BRING ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO GATHER TO DISCUSS AREAS OF CONCERN AND ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION. WHICH IS WHY I'M WE ARE SO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS TYPE OF COMMISSION BEING FORMED AND ALSO SORT OF THE CONVENING OF UNIX AT DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. COME.

DEALING WITH THAT WE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE NOT ONLY AFFECTED BY THE CHANGES AND AND HOW THE WORKPLACE IS FUNCTIONING WERE ALSO THE MAKERS OF THE DEVICES -- MACHINES AND AND ROBOTS ARE GOING TO BE CHANGING THE FUTURE WORK SO WORK. DIRECTLY IMPACTED WE APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR STERN IS BRINGING THIS BILL BACK OF THIS YEAR IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I AND WHY WE'RE STILL ENGAGING -- IS BASED ON THE SAME CONVERSATION THAT WE WERE HAVING LAST YEAR WE AGREE. WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE MILLIKAN INSTITUTE IN THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS NEED TO BE PRESENT WHEN WE'RE DICUSSING THIS IN OUR ISSUE NOW IS THAT THE BILL ONLY IDENTIFIES. ONE POSITION FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE AFFECTED DIFFERENTLY FROM THE RETAIL INDUSTRY DEFINITIVELY FROM THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION HEALTHCARE AND ALL THAT SO WE'RE SAYING IS TO TO GET THE DATA THAT WE KNOW THE SENDER SIR WANTS TO HAVE A WE JUST NEED ALL THOSE FOLKS AT THE TABLE SO. THAT IS OUR ONLY CONCERN -- AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL IS BEING BACK WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE. VERY GOOD I I I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK YOU'VE MADE A GOOD POINT. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OR AS A MORNING MILITARY MEMBERS MATTHEW ALL OF WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WE WE ALSO HAVE A SUPPORT OF HIM IN A POSITION THE BILL FOR THE SAME REASON STATED REASONS VERY GOOD THANK YOU AT THE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ONE BRING IT BACK FOR DISCUSSION AYE AYE I WOULD AGREE THAT I THINK WE NEED. TO HAVE THE REPRESENTATION BECAUSE IT THE DIFFERENT WORK. FORCE I GOOD FOR INDUSTRIES -- HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND THINGS SO THE WAY IT'S LAID OUT RIGHT NOW IS IS WHAT IT THE ONLY SPECIFICITY IN THIS SORT OF MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS ARE ONE REP FROM ORGANIZED LABOR AND ONE REP FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT IT DOESN'T. GET GRANULAR BEYOND THAT RIGHT SO IT'S FOUR MEMBERS FROM THE GOVERNOR ONE SPEAKER ONE PRO TEM SECRETARY OF LABOR AND CONTROLLERS EX OFFICIO. SO THE ONLY SURE TO CALL OUT SIR ONE ORGANIZED LABOR WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES AND ONE PRIVATE SECTOR WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES. SOME OPEN TO IDEAS BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO GET THE EXPERTISE THERE TOO SO I'M. I'M OPEN AT YEAH I'M NOT I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THE MECHANICS OF IT OUGHT TO WORK. I MEAN HOW HOW SHE HOW HOW SPECIFIC WILL BE LIKE WE CALL OUT AND EGG MANUFACTURING TAKE AND SORT OF START TO BREAK IT INTO SENATORS BUT THEN DO WE MISS SECTORS I DON'T KNOW. SO WESTERN EUROPE. YEAH. COUPLE QUESTIONS SURE BECAUSE ONE THING I WORRY I THIS IS A GREAT. HER GOOD HAN. WELL GREAT ALSO. HELLO IT'S GOOD YOU KNOW IT IS IT THIS IS  BIG INDUSTRY THAT'S COMING RIGHT BUT I DO WORRY WE HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OVERSIGHT DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW. SO IT HOW IS ARE THEY GOING TO BE PAID [inaudible] THIS IS. ARE THESE PAID POSITIONS. I DIDN'T SEE THE BILL OR WHERE THEY BECOME A PAID POSITIONS IF. NOT HOW MUCH IN AND HOW MUCH WILL IT COST THE STATE. RIGHT HOW MUCH WORK IS THERE IN THE FUTURE OF WORK -- THE COMMISSION SHALL BE ADVISORY ONLY. NO WRITER OBLIGATION THE STATE TEMPERAMENT FINDINGS I GUESS IT'S YEAH I WOULD IMAGINE. I DON'T IMAGINE WHO WOULD ASK THE I WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR GUIDANCE ON THAT I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT WHEN I COULD GIVE YOU NOT GONNA GIVE ANSWER I DON'T HAVE -- ASSUME THAT THERE'S SOME PER DIEM ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SERVICE. IN IT DOES GO TO APPROPRIATIONS SO THEY'LL LOOK AT THE YEAH THE COST. AND YOU CAN WORK WITH HIM THE HOPE HERE CENTER IS THAT. IF THE GOVERNOR'S ALREADY DOING THIS AND ALREADY PUTTING BUDGETARY RESOURCES TOWARDS IT INTERNALLY THAT WE WANT TO WE WANT SORT OF SOME LEGISLATIVE APPOINTEES IN THAT PROCESS OR WAY TO FORMALIZE IT. SO THAT'S THE ONCE I GET THOSE BACK GOOD I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT GOOD YOU GOT. VERY GOOD THE YES AND NO THANK YOU CENTER STERN FOR BRING THIS -- BILL FOR ANY THIS. WE NEED TO LOOK STRATEGICALLY THE NATURE OF THE WORK PLACE AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT AUTOMATION I MEAN WITH THAT AUTOMATION FOR AWHILE ACTUALLY BUT WE'VE MOVED FROM I GUESS I'M NATION FOR MECHANICAL. WORK TO NOW AUTOMATION INVOLVING -- OTHER TYPES OF WORKING CUTTING CERTAIN TYPES OF COGNITIVE WORK SO WE TALK ABOUT SELF DRIVING CARS RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST. YOU KNOW ACTUALLY YOU HAVE AUTOMATION IN CARS READY BUT YOU HAVE - SO AND HOW THAT THEN CAUSES DISPLACEMENT AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT ALSO THE NATURE OF THE THE THE WORKPLACE MOVING FROM SERVE THE OLD INDUSTRIAL AND ECONOMY WITH THE HELP THE ASSEMBLY LINE TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF A COULD. CALM THE INVOLVING A MUCH MORE -- NO COGNITIVE TYPE WORK ETCETERA SO APPRECIATE THAT I PRESUME YOU'RE OPEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT THE COMPOSITION THE COMMISSION IT'S ACTUALLY FAIRLY SMALL AND IT SAYS SIX PEOPLE SO IT'S POSSIBLE ONE COULD FIGURE YOU OUGHT TO TRY TO GET REPRESENTS SOME. OF THAT SO YOU CAN GET A LITTLE BROADER REPRESENTATION I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT MOST COMMISSIONS. YOU KNOW CONFIRM PEOPLE IN THE STATE SENATE. THAT'S USUALLY WHAT THAT THEY SAY AND THAT DAY I THINK MAIN EXPENSES. AFTER IT'S NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE COMMISSION'S WORK SO AND I'M SURE THAT. YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH THAT WITH APPROPRIATIONS SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE TE BILL. WE'RE GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND CERTAIN VERY BRIEFLY APPRECIATE THINGS THE DISCUSSION I HOPE WE CAN DIG MORE INTO THESE DETAILS I MEAN OTHER. POINTS THIS YEAR SPECIFICALLY AROUND IS SORT OF NEAR TERM -- ISSUES IN IN THE LABOR -- WORLD BUT THIS IS STARTED. TRY TO LOOK AT A HEAD AND BE A LITTLE BIT. FOR LOOKING SO WE DON'T RUN INTO CONFLICTS DOWN THE LINE SO WE CAN ANTICIPATE A ISSUES YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT IT'S HARD FOR ROBOT TO FOLD THE TOWEL OR TO DEAL WITH A A BED PAN FOR A IN HOME SERVICE -- WORKER AND THAT THEY ARE LESS VULNERABLE THAN SAY YOU KNOW A RADIO LIKE A NO RADIOLOGICAL ASSISTANT DOING SCANS -- IN THE SYSTEM OF OF X. RAYS YOU KNOW THESE ARE MICRO -- ANALYSES THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED SO WE CAN GET OUT AHEAD OF THINGS AND HOPEFULLY PREPARE WORKFORCE FOR A FUTURE WHERE WE HAVE WORK.
