ALREADY WERE FACING SUBSTANTIAL HARDSHIPS WE HAVE THE LARGEST PAY GAP IN THE NATION FOR LATINAS VERSUS ANY OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC. IN FACT IT'S FORTY TWO CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. FOR WHAT EVERY WHITE MAN MAKES WE'VE HAD HEALTH DISPARITIES. AND WE'VE HAD- ISSUES THAT AFFECT THE LIVES OF LATINOS WHO ARE SO OFTEN GONE UNSEEN IN THE STATE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER THIS PANDEMIC HAS ALSO AFFECTED LEVINE IS IN A DISPROPORTIONATE WAY. SO WE'RE GONNA OUTLINED THAT TODAY SO THAT MAYBE WE CAN COME OUT OF THIS WITH SOME IDEAS AND POSSIBLE. WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN TACKLE- THESE DISPARITIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THIS IS I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER FOR ALLOWING US TO PUT TOGETHER THE SELECT COMMITTEE IT IS VERY UNIQUE- AND THE REASON HE- ALLOWED US TO DO SO IS BECAUSE HE DID RECOGNIZE. THE DISPARITIES THAT WE HAVE- NOT JUST IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY BUT SPECIFICALLY TO LETTING US.

BY JOB LOSSES AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC WE'RE GOING TO SEE ARE LATINOS- AND FOR WOMEN OF COLOR BUT PUT ON THE CALIFORNIA LATINOS BUT IT'S WOULD REMIND US IT'S NOT JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE PROBLEM BUT SOLUTIONS AND REMEDIES WHETHER THEY'RE PAID FAMILY LEAVE SICK DAYS MINIMUM WAGE HEALTH CARE ALL THESE POLICIES RELATE TO HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE SO LET'S LEARN TODAY AND FOCUSING ON BRINGING ABOUT RESULTS.

MEASURE AND EXCITED TO HEAR FROM OUR TALENTED AT THE MASS- WHO HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION I'M SURE A LOT OF SOLUTIONS OF HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TO ENSURE THAT. THAT THE NOTES ARE NOT AT THE END OF THE LINE LIKE WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND I'M SO GLAD THAT WORKED WE'VE- NEVER SHARE THE DAYS. WE COULD AND HEAR YOU. WITH THAT I THINK. WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR FIRST PANEL- AND I'M SORRY AGAIN TO. DR MESSIAS WHO WE LEFT WAITING AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO BRING HER BACK UP TO BEGAN. SHE'S A RESEARCH ANALYST AND A CONSULTANT FOR HOPE AND- SHE CAN GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WHEN SHE IS READY. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLYWOMAN GONZALEZ AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THAT THE NIGHT IN EQUITIES. I'M ALSO THE CS I'M A RESEARCH ANALYST REPRESENTING HOPE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT FINDINGS ON THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF THAT THE LAST- BOTH BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND SETS- AS YOU HEARD. I THINK THAT MAKE UP NEARLY 20% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION THAT'S A 40% INCREASE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY NINETEEN WITH MUCH MORE EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT FEW. DECADES ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ISN'T THAT ENOUGH AND IN SOME REGIONS OF COURSE WHICH WAS MUCH HIGHER. SO BEFORE THE PANDEMIC MANY OF THE DISPARITIES AT THE NEST OCT BASE HAVE BEEN FALLING TO HISTORIC LOWS. BUT THEN IT HAD MADE GREAT STRIDES SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION IN BUSINESS OWNERSHIP EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES HOMEOWNERSHIP AND PURCHASING POWER THE VERY FACTORS THAT ADD TO FINANCIAL STABILITY AND BUILD WEALTH. BUT AS A GROUP THEY REMAIN MUCH MORE VULNERABLE TO ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND IN FACT THE COPD INDUCED RECESSION HAS WIPED OUT MANY OF THOSE ECONOMIC GAINS. IN BOTH THE CURRENT RECESSION AND THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION I THINK THAT'S A STATE DISPROPORTIONATELY GREATER FINANCIAL LOSSES. THEY ALSO TOOK LONGER TO RECOVER THAN OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AFTER THE LAST RECESSION JUST AS THEY ARE EXPECTED. TO DO FOR THIS RECESSION. IN THE FIRST SIX YEARS OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION WHITE NON HISPANIC HOUSEHOLDS LOTS OF TOTAL OF 30% OF THEIR WEALTH. WHILE HAT NEXT HOUSEHOLDS LOST BY TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN THE MEDIAN WEALTH LEFT IN THE HOUSEHOLD ROSE FASTER THAN THAT OF WHITE HOUSEHOLDS. BUT IT'S STILL SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THAT OF WHITE HOUSEHOLDS. THEY EXPECT THE EXPECTATIONS THEN IS THAT LATIN NEXT HOUSEHOLD WEALTH WILL FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATTERN DURING AND AFTER THIS RECESSION UNFORTUNATELY. BUT EVEN SO BY TWENTY NINETEEN THAT NEXT PURCHASING POWER IN CALIFORNIA ROSE TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S UP REPRESENTS ABOUT A 20% SHARE OF THE TOTAL BUYING POWER IN THE STATE. THE GAP BETWEEN LATIN ACCENT WHITE HOUSE WILL BECOME NARROWED BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS LET NEXT HOUSEHOLD RECOVERED FROM THE PREVIOUS RECESSION BUT THE AVERAGE LET NEXT HOUSEHOLD INCOME WAS STILL ONLY 68% OF WHITE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND THEN THERE'S THE WAGE GAP. THE AVERAGE WHAT WORKING FULL TIME YEAR ROUND IN CALIFORNIA EARNED SEVENTY NINE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR EARNED BY A WHITE MAN IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT YOU'VE HEARD LIKE PEANUTS EARNED LESS THAN FORTY TWO CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR EARNED BY A WHITE MAN. THAT'S A WIDER PAY GAP IN IN TWENTY ELEVEN ONE NINETEEN S. EARNED FORTY FIVE SECS. SO THAT MEANS THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE YEAR BEFORE THE RECESSION AND LAST AT TWENTY NINETEEN BUT THEN AS HAVE MADE ABSOLUTELY NO PROGRESS IN FACT THEY'VE LOST GROUND SINCE THE HIGH OF TWENTY ELEVEN. HOWEVER OVER THAT SAME PERIOD WHITE WOMEN HAVE INCREASED BY THREE STEPS. WHICH ISN'T GREAT BUT CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER THAN NOT BEING US AND TELLS US THAT THERE SHOULD BE THAT THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROGRESS FOR LETTING US AS WELL. THE WAGE GAP IS EVEN WORSE IN LOS ANGELES AND THE SILICON VALLEY- WHERE. THESE FIGURES ARE EXACERBATED BY THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN EACH OF THOSE REGIONS. BECAUSE OF THE WAGE GAP THE AVERAGE THAT THE IT WOULD HAVE TO WORK UNTIL THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN. TO EQUAL WHAT THE AVERAGE WHITE MAN EARNS BY THE AGE OF SIXTY. SO DURING THE LAST RECESSION WHEN JOBS ARE HARD TO COME BY MEDINA STARTED BUSINESSES. AND THERE'S EARLY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY MAY DO SO AGAIN TO GET THROUGH. THIS RECESSION ESPECIALLY ONCE THE- THE STATE OPENS UP. I THINK THAT'S CREATED TWO POINT THREE MILLION NEW FIRMS NATIONWIDE REPRESENTING 18% OF ALL WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES. BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. MOST LATINO OWNED BUSINESSES ARE VERY SMALL MICRO BUSINESSES THAT WITH LESS THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES IN MANY MANY WITH NO EMPLOYEES. GET THEY STILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THEIR EMPLOYEES BY 30% OR CLOSE TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS NATIONWIDE. BUT DESPITE IT BEING AS ENTHUSIASM FOR STARTING BUSINESSES THEY ARE LESS REVENUE THAN ALL WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE EMPLOYEES LESS LIKELY TO SCALE AND MORE LIKELY TO OPERATE ON. RAZOR THIN MARGINS. OUT BY MAY OF 202025% OF EXISTING THAT NEXT ENTERPRENEURS HAD LOST SIGNIFICANT REVENUE DUE TO PANDEMIC RELATED CLOSURES- BUT WERE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THE CARES ACT RELIEF PROGRAMS. A WHILE IT MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT PERSISTENT DISPARITIES IN OUTCOMES RESULT IN AN OPPORTUNITY GAP PREVENTING STUDENTS FROM REACHING THEIR EDUCATIONAL AND LIFE GOALS AND IMPORTANTLY. THIS FOLLOWS THEM INTO THEIR WAGE LEARNING WAGE EARNING YEARS LET NEXT K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS HAVE-ALREADY FALLEN BEHIND A FULL ACADEMIC YEAR LAST YEAR. AND WITH- AND THIS TREND IS CONTINUING THROUGH THE CURRENT YEAR. THE TOP DRIVER OF WEALTH CREATION IT IS EQUITY IN A HOME. AFTER SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE YEARS SIX POSSIBLY SEVEN YEARS OF PURCHASING HOMES AT ABOVE AVERAGE RATES THE LIGHT NEXT HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE CALIFORNIA ROSE 2404% IN TWENTY NINETEEN COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF FIFTY FIVE. PERCENT BUT LIVE NEXT HOMEOWNERS HAVE LESS EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES THEY HAVE LESS EQUITY IN THEIR BUSINESSES AND THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO OWN RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS AND STOCKS ADDED THAT THE WAGE GAP AND LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATION. AND YOU HAVE LESS FINANCIAL SECURITY AND GREATER VULNERABILITY WHEN SESSIONS HIT. BUT THE NOSE A JILL HERE LATER MAKE UP A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CONFIRMED NINETEEN OF KOBE CASES IN CALIFORNIA. THE FINANCIAL CONNECTION IS THAT TWO THIRDS OF BANKRUPTCIES RESULT FROM HIGH MEDICAL BILLS OR TO TIME LOST FROM WORK. EVEN FOR THOSE WITH HEALTH INSURANCE THE HIGH DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS PLUS JOB LOSSES IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE. SO CONTRACTING CODE COULD BE FINANCIALLY DEVASTATING AS WELL AS DEADLY. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC LEVINE AS HAD BEEN ENJOYING SUCCESS ALONG VARIOUS METRICS AND THE BROADER ECO SYSTEM OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS INCREASINGLY TIED TO THEIR ECONOMIC WELL BEING. SO WE RECOMMEND INSTITUTING POLICIES THAT MITIGATE THAT DISPROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL DAMAGES THAT DAMAGE THAT MEDINA SUFFER WITH EVERY ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. TO FACILITATE THEIR ABILITY TO RECOVER IN THE SHORT TERM AND HELP THEM TO REIMAGINE OUR FUTURE IN THE LONGER TERM. WE SHOULD SUPPORT THAT IN A BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND HOMEOWNERSHIP ENSURE THEY ARE PAID FAIRLY PROMOTE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES THROUGH GREATER ACCESS TO INSURANCE. AND URGE THEM TO DIVERSIFY THEIR INTEREST INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS BEYOND HOME OWNERSHIP. AND ENSURE THAT THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEED AND THE LEAST ACCESS TO RESOURCES HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO CLIMB OUT OF. POVERTY THAT ULTIMATELY BENEFITS THE ENTIRE ECONOMY OF THE STATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR INTEREST IN FOR HOSTING THIS PANEL. THANK YOU DOCUMENTS YES- WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PANEL AND THEN OPEN UP QUESTIONS SO WILL NOW MOVE ON TO DOCTOR MERRY LOPEZ AN ACT NOT MAKES PROFESSOR AT OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE. AND UCLA U. C. L. A. L. P. I. A POLICY EXPERT. PLEASE GO AHEAD TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY DR LOPEZ. ASSEMBLY WHEN DOLLARS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON ELECTION NIGHT IN EQUITIES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO TALK ABOUT. ON THE LABOR MARKET CHALLENGES CONFRONTING MARTINEZ G. CHIU PREVENT- NINETEEN- AND OFFER STRATEGIES FOR ENSURING THAT LET YOU KNOW SURPLUS FOR FRONT OF THE JOBS. AND EQUITABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY- SO IF YOU THE SLIDES HERE ARE FOCUSED ON SYNERGISTIC THE KEY LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES UNEMPLOYMENT. LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION EMPLOYMENT CHIEF POPULATION RATIO SO WE CAN SEE THAT ON THE FIGURE HERE SHOWS THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE LABOR MARKET MARKET OUTCOMES OF WHAT SHE DOES. ALL THE WHILE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR LATINOS HAS DECLINED SINCE REACHING ITS PEAK AT NINETEEN POINT 8% IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY. IS YET TO RETURN TO ITS PRE PANDEMIC LEVEL RESULTING IN A WIDENING GAP BETWEEN LATINOS AND WHITES- OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION. AS PARTLY TO RID OUR RESPONSE FOR THIS IN JUST INTEREST SECTOR. WE KNOW THAT BETWEEN FEB. AND MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY THE LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY- LOST ABOUT FORTY THREE OR 42% OF THEIR JOBS WHILE SERVICE INDUSTRIES LOST ABOUT 27% OF THEIR JOBS. AND WE CAN SEE HERE THAT WOMEN ARE- CONCENTRATED IN THOSE- PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES- AND OCCUPATIONS ALSO LAST NEXT WORKERS ALL ARE ALSO OVER REPRESENTED IN FRONT LINE. INDUSTRIES SUCH AS BUILDING OUR CLEANING SERVICES OR WE SEE 40% OF. BLACKS WORKERS REPRESENTED THEIR RESEARCH ALSO HAS SHOWN THAT ONE LOT NEXT WORKERS BUT CUT BACK ON THE PAYROLL- THEY WERE MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE WORKERS G. REPORT BEING LAID OFF AGAIN- WHEN LOCAL SEARCHES AND INSPECTIONS RESULTED IN FURTHER ECONOMIC SHUT DOWN. AND NOT PRESENTS A BIG- CHALLENGE FOR THEM IN TERMS OF GREATER. JOB SECURITY. I IN TERMS OF HOW. ARE EGGS ON A RATES HIGHER THAN LAST AVERAGE AND WILL POINT TIMES MORE. TO NOT BE COVERED BY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMPARED TO OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS SO THIS UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND PROVIDING SUPPORT. FOR OUT REACH OUT FOR ITS TARGET AT WORKERS WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF YOUR ELIGIBILITY OR REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN APPLYING FOR BENEFITS. ON THE EMPLOYMENT TO POPULATION RATIO IS ANOTHER WAY TO MEASURE- THE CURRENT STATE OF LABOR MARKET- IN THE SHORT RUN TO FIGURE TO YOUR SHOWS THAT LATINOS EXPERIENCED A SHARP. JOB LOSS IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC- EVEN THOUGH JOB CREATION HAS INCREASED SINCE APRIL LATINOS STILL- ARE THE FARTHEST FROM RETURNING TO THE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS- AGAIN THE JOB LOSSES POSE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FOR LATINAS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE POINT PRIMARY OR SOLE BREADWINNERS FOR THEIR FAMILIES COMPARED TO THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. FOR WHITE MOTHERS WE ALSO KNOW THAT POVERTY RATES FOR LATINOS ARE ALMOST DOUBLE THOSE OF WHITES IN BOTH THE US AND CALIFORNIA. ON IN ADDITION A LOT NEXT ON LEE'S EXPERIENCE 265% INCREASE IN WEALTH- AS OPTIMISTIC AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ON THE LOT NEXT WHITE GOT FELT VERY LITTLE CHANGED VERY LITTLE- IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WITH LIVE NEXT HOUSEHOLDS STILL HAVINGMUCH LOWER LEVELS OF WEALTH COMPARED TO WHITE HOUSEHOLDS. A LOT NEXT HOUSEHOLDS ALSO REPORT HAVING AN AVERAGE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN HIGHLY LIQUID ASSETS WHICH ARE COMING FROM CHECKING ACCOUNTS SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. COMPARED TO EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WHITE HOUSEHOLDS SO THE COMBINATION OF JOB LOSS INCOME LOSS HIGHER POVERTY RATES AND PARTICULAR LOCK OF WEALTH AND EMERGENCY SAVINGS REALLY PUTS MANY OF THESE LATINO BREADWINNERS- AND ECONOMIC DESPAIR. AND IT'S NOT JUST- IT'S NOT JUST AN WITH ABOUT YOU KNOW- LET YOU BREADWINNERS- BUT IT'S ALSO SORT OF. A THE AND YOUR OF ALL IN JUST. AND I KEEP. THAT ARE ONE ARE FACING THESE CHAU- AN EXCITING YEAR SHOWS. THE LABOR FORCE FOR. RATE I'M FOR WOMEN SO YOU SEEN THAT THE- LET'S USE EXPERIENCE A DISPROPORTIONATE DROP IN LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATES- SENSE OF FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY OF ABOUT PERCENTAGE POINTS. ON THE DROP IN LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION ISN'T JUST COMING FROM LOST JOBS IT'S COMING FROM WOMEN ACTUALLY EXITING ON THE LABOR MARKET THE LABOR FORCE. SO WE CAN SEE HERE THAT- AND THIS NEXT ROUND OF LUCK NEXT WORKERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE PAID SICK LEAVE IN. OTHER ALSO- LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME SO THE LACK OF JOB FLEXIBILITY- AND BENEFITS MAKES IT CHALLENGING FOR A LOT NEXT PARENTS TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES- AND THEIR CHILDREN WHO MIGHT BE AT HOME BECAUSE OF SCHOOL CLOSURES. SOTHIS CREATES AN EVEN BIGGER CHALLENGE FOR LARGER HOUSEHOLDS OUR SINGER SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS WHAT NEXT HOURS A LARGER HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN AND A LARGER SHARE OF SINGLE MOTHER HOUSEHOLDS COMPARED TO WHITE HOUSEHOLDS. I'M AS A RESULT SOME LATINOS MAY FACE THE TOUGH DECISION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THEIR JOBS AND THEIR FAMILIES. MOTHERS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE MORE VULNERABLE THAN FATHERS TO THE PANDEMIC DETACHMENT FROM THE LABOUR FORCE OUR RECENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOTHERS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN FATHERS TO TAKE A LEAVE- FROM WORK DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE PANDEMIC. AND SO WE'RE SEEING HERE THAT WORKING LAST CHECKING TIME OFF IN. PROMOTED LAST ALL CONTRIBUTE TO LOWER EARNINGS AND WILL INCREASE THE GENDER EARNINGS GAP FARTHER FROM WHAT WE SIXTEEN ALREADY IT ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OVERALL ECONOMY IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT MOTHERS LEAVING THE LABOR FORCE COULD COST SIXTY FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR- IN LOST WAGES AND ECONOMIC. ACTIVITY ON THE LONGER THAT WOMEN REMAIN OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE IT BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT OR REENTER TO RESEARCH SHOWS THAT INDIVIDUALS AND WHEN OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE FOR SIX MONTHS OR MORE. ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE CALLED BACK FOR INTERVIEWS WE SEE THAT THIS IS NOT JUST GONNA **** US. THANKS AS WELL BUT YOU LOOK YOU'RE DESPERATE FIGURE SEE THAT AGAIN DO YOU DRAW IN LATE FORCE WHICH IS. EVEN AMONG WITH NO CHILL. ARE FOR A LOT TO LIKE LARA THAN IT IS FOR THOSE THAT ACTUALLY HAVE OUR CHILDREN. AND INSURANCE ARE JUST SOME POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S NOT CLEAR TO DROP A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE. AMONG LATINOS IS GOING TO BE TEMPORARY OR WHETHER WE CALL MORE PER MINUTE. THE LONGER LATINOS CONTINUE TO REMAIN OF THE LABOR FORCE THE GREATER THE DANGER THAT THEY WILL PERMANENTLY REMAIN OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE WHICH CAN HAVE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS. FOR HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND EARNINGS SO POLICIES THAT PROVIDE GREATER SUPPORT FOR AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE POLICIES AND EVEN CREATE MORE CHILD CARE CENTERS BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN LOW INCOME AREAS OCT FUTURE CHILD CARE CENTERS COULD HELP LATINAS MAINTAIN. THEIR ATTACHMENT TO THE LABOR FORCE AS WE COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. IN ADDITION JOB PROTECTION POLICY SHOULD BE ENHANCED AND EXPANDED TO ALL WORKERS UTILIZE PAID FAMILY LEAVE REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF EMPLOYER OR THE NUMBER OF HOURS THEY WORK. ALSO EXTENDING THE MINIMUM NUMBER SIX DAYS PROVIDED BY EMPLOYERS FOR ALL WORKERS REGARDLESS OF THE EMPLOYER SIZE IMPORTANT. LABOR MARKET DISCRIMINATION AS CAP LATINOS AND LOCANE INFLEXIBLE JOBS THAT OFFER FEW BENEFITS SO EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO REDUCE OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION FOR LATINOS. TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS IN HUMAN CAPITAL MAY HELP LATINOS MOVING TO BETTER PAYING JOBS WITH GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS. ALSO THE LABOR MARKET EXPERIENCES I'VE DOCUMENTS AND LATINOS MAY ALSO BE CONTRIBUTING TO SOME OF THE TRENDS THAT WE'VE OBSERVED. SO DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT FOR IMMIGRANT WOMEN STYLE BY 20% COMPARED TO THIRTEEN PERCENT. FOR NON IMMIGRANT WOMEN AND 9% FOR NON IMMIGRANT MAN. SO EXCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED LATINOS FROM FEDERAL AND STATE SUPPORT. PROGRAMS LEAVES THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES I MANY WHO ARE PART OF. STATUS HOW. WHERE LEAST ONE OF MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY A U. S. CITIZEN. AND I'M VERY LONG POSITION RESEARCH HAS HUGE NOT. A DOC WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF STIMULUS. SHARKS COULD RESULT IN A FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN OVERALL ECONOMIC OUTPUT. FINALLY I THINK. I FEEL THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR LATINOS IS- INCREASE THEIR WEALTH. THE WEALTH DIFFERENCE AND THE WEALTH DISPARITY IS JUST SO STARK COMPARED TO EVEN THE WAGE AND INCOME DISPARITIES. SO THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC GAPS IN WEALTH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED GREATER ACCESS TO WEALTH ALLOWS HOUSEHOLDS TO BETTER WEATHER ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. AND WILL ALLOW LATINOS THE RESOURCES TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND THEIR HEALTH AND HUMAN CAPITAL AND ONE WAY TO DO THIS AS WELL- THAT DOCTOR MISSY IS ALREADY MENTIONED. HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT BUSINESS OWNERSHIP BUSINESS OWNERSHIP ENTREPRENEURSHIP COULD PROVIDE LATINAS WITHIN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS AS WELL AS A WAY TO BUILD AND ACCUMLATE WEALTH. SO PROGRAMS THAT DRAW OR- PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS IN ANY QUALITIES AND ACCESS TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL. PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW AND HOPEFUL WELL LET'S SEE THE BUSINESS OWNERS REACH A BROADER MARKETS- COULD ACTUALLY INCREASE NOT ONLY BUSINESS STARTER SHOCKED BUT HOW WELL THEY DO SO THAT THEY CAN PROSPER AND USE. THAT AS A WEALTH ACCUMULATION TOOL. ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR LOPEZ- WE THOUGHT IMPORTANT OBVIOUS TO HEAR THE STATUS TO HEAR FROM THE EXPERTS BUT ALSO TO HEAR FROM THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ACTUALLY WORKING- ARE THE WORKERS THE LATINO WORKERS DURING THIS PANDEMIC- WE'RE GONNA NOW HEAR FROM CYNTHIA LOPEZ AS SHE IS A MEMBER OF UNITE HERE LOCAL THIRTY- AND SHE'S GOING TO SHARE HOW THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED HER PERSONALLY SO SHE'S AVAILABLE CYNTHIA.

EIGHTEEN TO SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLD- CALIFORNIANS BASED ON OCCUPATION WITH OTHER BREAKOUTS COPPER. RACE AND ETHNICITY RIGHT TO THE STUDY WORKING AGE ADULTS EXPERIENCED A 22% INCREASE IN MORTALITY COMPARED TO HISTORICAL PERIODS. DURING THE PANDEMIC HOWEVER. THANK YOU EXCESS MORTALITY WAS HIGHEST IN FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS CALIFORNIANS IT MAKES 36% INCREASE IN MORTALITY. THERE WAS A 59% INCREASE AMONG LATINOS. IN AB BUT YOU NEVER GO TO WORKERS. I'M I- ECKSTINE IT IS KEY ARE TO CONTINUE HAVING I SAVE UP. WHICH TO PLY ARE FROM THESE FROM WORKERS- I'M FIRST AND FOR TO ME I. ARTICLE SAID NINE. YOUR RECALL WORKER UNDER ONE B. SO FAR THAT WE KNOW OF ONLY RIVERSIDE DOING SO. I OF ALL NIGHT THIS OF WOULD BE AS HONOR TO FOLLOW SEARCH I IS. ENACTED A BRIEF US ONLY TO THROW OF THE YEAR FROM. HOWEVER MY GREATEST WERE IN THE U. STATES. I WAS BORN IN MAY. AND I'M EQUALLY PROUD OF MY MEXICAN SEPTIC AND HERITAGE US CITIZENSHIP. IT IS NOT LOST ON ME THAT I'M THE FIRST LIKE TEANECK EMIGRATE TO SERVICE. OF A NATIONAL UNION IN THE UNITED STATES- WOMEN FARMWORKERS FACE BURDEN MEN DO NOT. EAT IT IN ADDITION TO DOING HARD WORK IN VERY SKILLED WORK. WOMEN WORKERS ARE ALSO WIVES AND MOTHERS. THEY COME HOME FROM WORK TO FEEDING THEIR FAMILIES AND TAKING CARE OF THEIR KIDS. THEY FACE SPECIAL CHALLENGES AND INIQUITIES. ARE IN THE AGE OF COLLEGE. FARMWORKERS CAN SHELTER IN PLACE. OR WORK FROM HOME. FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CLASSIFIED ESSENTIAL WORKERS THEY MUST DO THEIR WORK TO FEED AMERICA. LACK OF TRANSPORTATION AND I AM FROM THE FIELD IS THAT. A BIGGER PROBLEM. FIGHTING RIGHT IT'S NOW HARDER OUT OF THE AFTER FOR COMPANIES. IN EVEN PP IT'S SORT OF THESE THINGS RECESSING ARE NOT OBSERVED. WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THEY COME HOME FROM WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR FAITH AND THEY HAVE. A THEY DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO ENSURE THAT THE KIDS ARE- DETERRED IS COOL WORK UNFORTUNATELY EVEN MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE ACCESS ACCESS TO THE TECHNOLOGY TO PARTICIPATE. I DIDN'T. IN HOUSTON EDUCATION- IRAQ OF CHILD IS THE NEED TO PROTECT BIGGER DILEMMA FONG IF THE ELECTION BECAUSE THEY ARE FORCED TO LEAVE KIDS ALONE WHERE THEY WORK IN NEIGHBORS REPORT THEM TO THEIR FIRST PAYMENT DEAL WITH INSURANCE DISTANCE LEARNING FOR THE CHILDREN WHAT THEY MUST BE AT WORK AND THEY CANNOT BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE SO WOMEN RELIEF AT FACING MANY CHALLENGES. ARE A GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING- A DIFFICULT TRADING HISTORY. ALL OF THE THIS IS A THE BUYER JUST. AFFECTING A RECORD OR WORKERS. IT'S PAST THE SPECIALLY WOMEN. AND AT GOVERNMENTAL LEVELS MUST DO ALL THEY CAN TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THESE. R. E. BEGINS WITH GETTING FARMWORKERS VACCINATED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CONSISTENT WITH. THANK YOU. I AM WOW WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT UP NOW TO QUESTIONS FOR THESE PANELIST IF ANY OF THE MEMBERS EITHER REMOTELY OR HERE WANT TO ASK A QUESTION. WE START WITH WENDY. CARILLO SORRY. VERY CASUAL DURING CODE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MUCH APPRECIATED I'M AND I'M SO EXCITED TO BE PART OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES- THAT FOR MANY OF US WE HAVE LIVED FIRST. MY QUESTION IS FOR MISS LOPEZ- WHO IS A PROFESSOR AT OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE WHICH IS AN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE SO I'M I'M EXCITED TO TALK TO YOU AND I ACTUALLY NEXT TUESDAY- I'M THE CHAIR BUDGET SUB FLOOR WE WILL BE HAVING AN OVERSIGHT HEARING ON SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS KELLY CAL E. I. T. C. ROLLOUT. AND I'M CURIOUS BASED ON KOVITZ SMALL BUSINESS RECOVERY PLANS AND OF THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TRACK OR HOW CAN WE BETTER TRACK OF THOSE RECOVERY EFFORTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES GOING TO. LET THE MATH SINCE OUR LETTING US ASK STATED ARE THE FASTEST GROWING SMALL BUSINESS DEMOGRAPHIC NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE NATION I FIND IT IS ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND OUR CHARGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE ALLOCATED FOR SMALL BUSINESS COVERT RELIEF ARE ACTUALLY GOING. TO ONE OF THE LARGEST POPULATIONS IN THE STATE WITH SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. I'M YEAH I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH WITH SORT OF LOOKING AT. LATINO ENTREPRENEURS IS ALSO DATA COLLECTION AND- AND SO YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE LARGE DATA SETS ARE PICKING UP. SORT OF INFORMATION ABOUT SORT OF- LARGER FIRMS- BUT THIS SORT OF YOU KNOW STOREFRONTS AND A LOT OF THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE HAS BEEN ON- LOOKING AT LATINO STOREFRONTS- IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF LIKE A SURVEY AND REALLY SORT OF TRACKING- THESE BUSINESS OWNERS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE DON'T NORMALLY DO AND DOCTOR NEEDS TO BE MORE FINDING IN TERMS OF LONGITUDINAL SURVEYS THAT TRACKED THESE BUSINES OWNERS OVER TIME PARTICULARLY SMALLER BUSINESSES- IN TERMS OF SEEING THEIR PROGRESS- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT AND IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE. ACCESS TO THE FUNDS- AND MAKING SURE THAT IT IS ADDRESSING KIND OF SOME OF THEIR NEEDS ONE OF THE THINGS I ALSO THAT I WOULD SA IS IT WHEN IT COMES TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IS IT'S REALLY ABOUT SORT OF ACCESS TO MARKETS ZERO AND SO YOU KNOW IF WE LOOK AT SORT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL DIVIDE THAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN HERE- MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS LARGER BUSINESSES. OR THE SAME ACCESS TO YOU KNOW USING TECHNOLOGY AS A WAY TO ADVERTISE- BUT SMALL TOOLS WE SEE LENA LET LET YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE ARE ARE MORE LIKELY TO ON THE PHONE AND USE THAT PHONE FOR THEIR BUSINESS PURPOSES AND SO. THINKING ABOUT ALSO NOT JUST SORT OF PROVIDING START UP FUNDS AND CAPITAL FINANCIAL CAPITAL TO THESE BUSINESSES BUT REALLY HOPING THAT I THINK THINK THROUGH. THEIR BUSINESS STRATEGIES HOW CAN THEY REACH A WIDER MARKET- HOW CAN THEY USE TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERNET TO REACH OUT WIDER MARKET WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF BUSINESSES BE SUCCESSFUL NOT AREA- BUT- BUT THOSE THAT LACK THE TECHNOLOGY OR THE KNOW HOW ARE ABLE TO SORT OF REAP THOSE BENEFITS. SO- I THINK THESE ARE THINGS YOU KNOW ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK TRACKING THESE THESE BUSINESS ARE. AND SO THAT IS OFTEN LACKING. AND SO WE REALLY DON'T KNOW FOR EXAMPLE% YOU KNOW HOW SUCCESSFUL ARE SOME OF THESE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS- OR IF THEY'RE EVEN TARGETING THE RIGHT THINGS ON IN TERMS OF. OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO COME OUT- ON THE STRONGER AND HERE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A WAY TO BUILD WEALTH. IT'S A WAY TO HAVE YOU KNOW JOB SECURITY IT'S A WAY TO HAVE JOB FLEXIBILITY SO. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE WE NOW WHETHER THOSE INTERVENTION EFFORTS ARE WORKING AND HOW MUCH MORE WE NEED TO DO. THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT'S AS A FOLLOW UP- PROFESSOR LOPEZ- IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY OR TE CITY OF LOS ANGELES MEDIA SALINAS IS THE FIRST LET THE NOT TO CHAIR. THE ALLEY CHAMBER WHICH IT IS AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY I THINK FOR WOMEN IN BUSINESS- AND IN MY CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE SHARED WITH HER THERE'S BEEN A DISTINCTION IN TERMS OF. HOW DO YOU SUPPORT- LATINOS IN SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE. AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE CONVERSATION VERSUS THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AS WELL. AND SO HOW DO WE COMPATIBLE E. OUT CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MICROLOANS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT BANKS ARE BEING ACCESS BY. COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT. PERHAPS MAY NOT FEEL SO COMFORTABLE IN GOING INSIDE A BANK- ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW DURING COLD IT HOW DO WE ENSURE TAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ANYTHING LOS ANGELES WE HAVE. LET THE ANA OWN SMALL LITTLE BE INDEED THAT'S LIKE A LITTLE BALL DAY GOT TYPE STYLE- STOREFRONT THAT'S BEEN HEAVILY IMPACTED. BY COVE IT IT'S BEEN IMPACTED BY A LOCAL COUNTY. HEALTH INSPECTIONS AS WELL AS CHANGING- CHANGING DIRECTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE WHAT IS NOT POSSIBLE DURING COLD IT. AND SO I APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. LATINA ENTREPRENEURSHIP THERE ARE VARIOUS DIFFERENT LEVELS IN WHICH WE CAN THINK ABOUT BUSINESS- AND ULTIMATELY HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT TO YOUR POINT THOSE WITH. A LACK OF ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY OR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO FIND INFORMATION HOW THE INFORMATION BECAUSE WE CAN CREATE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. THAT ULTIMATELY DO NOT HELP. THE INTENDED. APAP OF WOMEN ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAT ACTUALLY NEED THE MOST HELP SO IT CREATES IN MY OPINION LIKE A VERY TOP DOWN. WAY IN WHICH WE DO GOVERNMENT THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY DOESN'T HELP COMMUNITY AND I ASSURE THAT TO SAY THAT. IF LATINOS ARE THE LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE FASTEST GROWING IN THE NATION. ANYTHING THAT IMPACTS LET THE NOT. IMPACTS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. AND SO AN ISSUE THAT IS A LATINA ISSUE IS AN AMERICAN ISSUE. AND WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THIS POPULATION IS SUCCESSFUL. IN ITS- IN THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M. DR GRANT DELAY YOU HAVE A QUESTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND REALLY I'M GLAD TO BE ABLE TO JOIN YOU TODAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. I'M WANTED TO AND BEFORE I FORGET I JUST WANT TO SAY HELLO TO THE SILVER MEDAL ONE OF MY HEROES AND A REAL CHAMPION FOR HER FROM WORKING COMMUNITY. MY QUESTION FOR TODAY IS GOING TO BE FOR DOCTOR MUST. LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED PAPER WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT POLICY ACTIONS OR SOLUTIONS. AS YOU STATE THAT THE POLICY RESPONSES ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT ADVERSE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC. OUTCOMES AND BEFORE YOU BEGIN ON THE- BOX THAT YOU HAVE I REALLY WANT TO JUST MENTION I KNOW WERE IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR STATE HOUSE. BUT IMMIGRATION REFORM IS THE NUMBER ONE POLICY REVIEW RECOMMENDATION THAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR YEARS IF NOT DECADES. THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP OUR LATINOS AND LATINOS REALLY WANTED TO TALK IF I COULD ABOUT FOUR HAVE YOU COMMENT ABOUT THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS SPECIFICALLY EITC AND I TENS. THAT OUR MAJORITY LEADER ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY AS CHAMPIONS LAST YEAR TO SEE IF THAT CAN BE INCLUSIVE AND IS WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WITH PRIORITIZING AND COME SUPPORT. DR MACIAS. AT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE UC MERCED PAPER WAS WRITTEN BY DIFFERENT PANELS FOR THE NEXT PANEL BUT YOUR QUESTION I THINK STILL RELEVANT. THAT THE NEXT PANEL WILL GET THE AUTHOR FOR THE ON. FAIR ENOUGH- DR MACIAS. I WILL YES IT'S NOT MY OF MY PAPER BUT I WILL COMMENT THAT- WE HAVE SEEN. THAT IN AS OF MAY TWENTY TWENTY- WE SAW THAT AS PEOPLE AS WOMEN WERE LOSING THEIR JOBS IT WAS THE IMMIGRANTS WHO LOST THE GREATEST NUMBER OF JOBSEEKERS PERCENTAGE THEY WERE THE ONES THAT WERE THE MOST IMPACTED BY THE JOB LOSSES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PANDEMIC STARTED EACH AND THOSE ARE THE SAME. PEOPLE WHO ALSO DID NOT HAVE ACCESS THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAFETY NET BUT OTHERS ARE OTHERS DEBT SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE- AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO- TO- THE STIMULUS MONIES SO I MEAN CAN YOU IMAGINE IS. IT AS AS MISTRUST AND YOU LOOK WHICH WAS WITH SPEAKING AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE. YOUR CHECK ON TOP OF EVERY ELSE SO I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY CRUCIAL AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING ACCESS TO THOSE- THE EXTENT I TENS- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE AT REACHING OUT. TO THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY DO QUALIFY IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN GET THOSE. THOSE THAT THAT. AT STATUS SO THAT THEY CAN GET ACCESS TO DUE TO THE SAFETY NET BENEFITS. AND THEN ALSO WHEN YOU JUST CONSIDER YOU KNOW EXPANDING. WHO DOES QUALIFY FOR THAT- SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY LEVELS AND WE NEED- IN IN I KNOW MY RESEARCH WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE ARE LIKE THE S. WE'VE DONE EXTREMELY WELL- WHO HAVE NOT BEEN. HEARD AS MUCH BY THE PANDEMICS ARE A FAX AND- AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE IN THE MIDDLE WHO ARE YOU KNOW OR- YOU KNOW. HAVING TO MAKE MAYBE A FEW CHANGES BUT STILL NOT IMPACTED WE'RE WITH THEM THERE'S JUST TREMENDOUS. PORTION OF THE- POPULATION IS WITH OURS ALSO I MEAN IT'S A HUGE NUMBER WHO ARE AFFECTING THE BOTTOM LINE FOR THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WOMEN WHO ARE YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT ARE SORT OF MESSAGE THEY'RE ALREADY RESPONSIBLE FOR FEEDING US THEY'RE ALREADY RESPONSIBLE NOW FOR TEACHING THEIR CHILDREN SO A SO THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT DOING MORRIS. IS FRANKLY TOWN CONSCIONABLE. IF I COULD I OPPOSE. FOR MIX THE TWO PANELS BUT OFTENTIMES BOTH THE ACT AND HEALTH IMPACTS ARE TIED THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT WERE SPOKEN ABOUT. AND THEN THAT I JUST WANT TO UPLIFT THE COMMENT FROM THE TULARE COUNTY RESIDENT WHO SAID. RIGHT NOW WE DIE OF HUNGER OR WE DIE OF THE VIRUS. FOR THOSE WHO ARE HAVING TO MAKE THOSE TOUGH CHOICES ABOUT MAKING. AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE ROUND TABLE THAT THOSE CHOICES BETWEEN ECONOMICS AND HEALTH ARE TIED. AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ARE PROVIDING SOLUTIONS SO WE CAN GET BETTER RESULTS AND- NOT CONTINUE TO HAVE LATINOS AND LATINOS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THIS PANDEMIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTRESS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I OFTENTIMES I HERE AND WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PANELISTS HOW WE NEED TO COLLECT DATA WE NEED TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS. WE ALL RECOGNIZE THIS AND I THINK FINDING THE RIGHT ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. UP LIFTING THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THAT CAPACITY. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS WE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE WE WANT THESE THINGS DONE. BUT IT'S FINDING THE RIGHT. THE RIGHT ORGANIZATION TO PUT TO THE FOREFRONT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. SO I WOULD ASK OUR PANELISTS. THAT IF THERE ARE THESE. INSTITUTIONS ALREADY THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THAT CAPACITY. I ALSO TO PLEASE PROVIDE THAT TO OUR CHAIR- THE IT IS MAKING SURE THAT AS WE MAKE OUR REQUEST IN OUR DEMANDS FOR MORE INCLUSIVE DATA COLLECTION MORE EAT BETTER EVALUATION OF THE DATA. THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SAY AND HERE IS THE ORGANIZATION THIS IS THE INSTITUTION THAT HAS THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS IN A PROPER WAY. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO AGREE WITH A COMMENT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. WE WANT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW WE GET THINGS DONE. I- I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK CENTER LOCUS OF MS LOPEZ THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORY IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT POLICIES BECAUSE WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED NOT THOSE OF US WHO STUDIED NOT THOSE OF US WHO HEAR ABOUT IT NOT THOSE OF US WHO SEE IT BUT THOSE WHO ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE IT THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE THE WORDS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO US SO- MS LOPEZ THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING. MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MANAGER AND I AND I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE SUMMER REYES IN TERMS OF THE DATA AND I KNOW- THE PROFESSOR LOPEZ MADE REFERENCE TO IT AND HOW DIFFICULT IT CAN BE TO GET. GOOD DATA BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA THEN WE CAN LEAVE THIS BUILDING FEELING GOOD LIKE WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING IN GETTING RESOURCES OUT THERE. BUT IT DOESN'T REDUCE THE SMALL BUSINESS OF THE NEED TO HELP THE FAMILIES THAT NEED HELP THE WORKERS NEED THE HELP AND SO. AGREE A 100% THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THIS- COMMITTEE GOES FORWARD THAT. EVERYONE THAT IS GOING TO BE A ROGUE WONDERFUL SENATE PANELS HERE OTHER THEY FEEL FREE TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE AND SEND INFORMATION TO US AND KEEP US FULLY INFORMED BECAUSE- WE KNOW. THAT THE INFORMATION WE GET IS ON DEPEND ON WHAT YOU CAN YOU TELL US ON THE GROUND. AND I WOULD LIKE TO JUST- YEAH. BECAUSE PRESENT TODAY A ROOM- WHO WHO. REFERRED TO. YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE CALL THE DEATH RATES AMONG THE HIGHEST OUR- COOKS SO THOSE ARE WORKING. FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS AND OTHER RESTAURANTS ALLOWING SO MANY OF US. TO BE ABLE TO STAY HOME. FARMWORKERS ALSO RIGHT UP THERE AS WELL. AND SO I KNOW OUR OUR CHAIR AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN. WILL PUSH FOR. MORE PAID SICK LEAVE AND I WAS SOMETHING THAT. I'M NOT PRESENT ROMERO MADE REFERENCE TO. BUT SHE ALSO MADE REFERENCE- TOWARDS THE END OF OUR COMMENTS REGARDING. THE CHANGING VACCINATION RULES. AND THE CONFUSION IT CREATES AND HOW CAN INTENSELY LEAVE PEOPLE OUT. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF- IS PRESIDENT OF ROMERO WOULD LIKE TO. COMMENT ON THAT BCAUSE I ALSO HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AS WE CHANGE THE RULES. THAT WERE NOT ACTUALLY GETTING THE AND WE DO KNOW. THAT FARMERS NEED TO GET BACK SENATE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE DYING THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE AGAIN ARE A CENTRAL FOR ALL OF US. AND SO ARE THERE ANY THOUGHTS NOW THAT THESE TOOLS AND CHANGE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE ESPECIALLY THOSE LIKE YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR- OUR CULTURE OF. SURVEILLANCE WE HAVE SOME ARAMBULA ANOTHER IS THAT THE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR FARMWORKERS. AND SO IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER THOUGHT ON THAT. COMMENT THAT WAS MADE ON HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THE VACCINES ARE GETTING TO ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND THIS CASE QUICKLY FARMWORKERS. OKAY FALL JUST ABOUT AS A COMMENT AND WE CAN ALWAYS FOLLOW UP WITH. YES SIR SO- PRESENT REMEMBER I THINK NEEDED TO CATCH A FLIGHT- SO SHE- HOW TO MOVE ON BUT THAT IS A- NOTED COMMENT- I HAVE IT'S NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION- FOR CYNTHIA. IT HER STORY- AS HEART WRENCHING IT IS IT IS REMINDS ME THOUGH WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT RE ENTRY INTO THE WORK FORCE AND I KNOW THAT. I AM HOPEFUL THAT CYNTHIA WILL BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO HER JOB AT THE SAN DIEGO- BAYFRONT HILTON BECAUSE SAN DIEGO HAS PAID HAS PASSED A RETENTION ORDINANCE A RECALL ORDINANCE. THAT MEANS THAT- WHEN THAT JOB IS AVAILABLE AT THANKS TO HER UNION AND THIS ORDINANCE SHE WILL HAVE A SHOT AT GETTING BACK INTO THE WORK FORCE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS SHE LEFT IT. I'M WONDERING FOR THE- ACADEMIC PANELISTS YOU KNOW HW IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RECOVERY IS BEING ABLE TO RETURN AS CALIFORNIA OPENS UP TO THE SAME JOB AT LEAST- OR BETTER FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND LEVINE IS THAT HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT FEATURE I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T SEEN DIEGO AND LARGE CITIES LOS ANGELES I THINK- A NUMBER OF LARGE CITIES BUT IT'S NOT UNIVERSAL FOR THE STATE. I WILL I WILL SAY THAT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL I MEAN. STARTING ANY NEW JOB IS DIFFICULT AND IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORTS YOU HAVE TO YOU MAY NEED NEW TRAINING SO BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK TO THAT JOB AND CERTAINLY IF YOU HAVE A BETTER. BETTER JOB EVEN BETTER- BUT ALSO WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO JOBS THAT HAVE BENEFITS THAT HAVE- YOU KNOW HOW THE SAFETY. PROTOCOLS IN PLACE IS ALSO ESSENTIAL I MEAN THIS THIS IS THIS IS A HARD LESSON FOR ALL OF US TO LEARN BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT THIS IS THE OF THE LAST PANDEMIC WILL BE FACING. AND EVEN EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC ISSUES IT ALSO DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEIR WORK EXISTING HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES. SO YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO BEING ABLE TO HAVE OPTIONS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN- THE OTHER ISSUE IS YOU KNOW. AS WE MENTIONED CHILD CARE. WOMEN TO HAVE THE GREATER BRANCH OF THE CHILD CARE AVERAGING AND TEACHING THEIR CHILDREN SO. HAVING BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO A JOB IT'S GOING TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THAT MAY. MAKE SOME CHILDCARE ALTERNATIVES POSSIBLE OR THAT. PROVIDE ENOUGH. OF A- LIVING WAGE THAT WILL PROVIDE- YOU KNOW JUST LEFT OVER TO PAY. FOR CHILD CARE IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. I JUST TO ECHO- I TALK TO SEE IF INSIDE THE THINK IT'S VERY IF YOU CAN BACK TO THAT JOB BUT IF THE JOB WAS GREAT TO BEGIN WITH. IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP AND I AND I THINK WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS. AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK. ABOUT IT JUST AND EQUITABLE RECOVERY SO AS WE COME OUT OF THIS. WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO IN TERMS OF RE SKILLING. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW JOB TRAINING- FOR LATINOS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IF WE WANT TO MOVE THEM INTO BETTER PAYING JOBS WE SEE THE OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION. THAT IS VERY MUCH AGAIN ALSO YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE LABOR MARKET- BUT I THINK WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE REDUCE STOCKS SEGREGATION SO THAT. AS DOCTORS YES I'VE NEVER COME DEMOCRATS ANOTHER DOWNTURN. IT'S NOT THOSE SAME WORKERS IN THOSE SAME INDUSTRIES AND OCCUPATIONS ARE TO KEEP GETTING AT. SO I THINK WE NEED TO THINK BIGGER ABOUT. YOU KNOW ME MOVING BEYOND THOSE THOSE JOBS THAT MANY OF THESE LATINOS HAVE INTO. SOMETHING BETTER. YEAH I'M THANK YOU I WILL NOTE THAT AS A GOOD UNION. JOBS AND I'M IN IT FOR A HOTEL IS WITH BENEFITS AND- A LIVING WAGES IS A- IS GOOD- WE DON'T I JUST WANT AYE I'LL PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THOSE STATEMENTS BECAUSE THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE GONNA COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC AND- RETRAIN PEOPLE FOR JOBS THAT AREN'T SERVICE SECTOR JOBS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF WHEN WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING FOR- INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOB TO BE AT LEAST GET BACK ON THEIR FEET WITH IT ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAD A GOOD SERVICE SECTOR JOBS THAT INCLUDED HEALTH CARE THAT INCLUDED A LIVING WAGE INCLUDED MAYBE A LITTLE BIT IN RETIREMENT. I THINK- I I'D I'D NEVER WANT TO SUGGEST THAT WERE WERE SAYING THAT THAT'S NOT A GOOD JOB- THOSE THEY SHOULD BE BETTER- BUT IT IT'S NOT EXACTLY- THE LOWEST ROUND. TO SAY THE LEAST. MMHM ASSEMBLY. I'M SURE ONE. CYNTHIA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR STORY WITH US I THINK IT IT TOUCHED ALL OF US AND- WE FEEL FOR YOU AND I AM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH THE REGRESSION THAT ARE SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS ARE FEELING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND I'M ALSO PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT. WHAT'S GOING ON DIAGNOSIS THIS PAST YEAR AND THERE'S GONNA BE A DOMINO EFFECT THAT WE WILL GET TO SEE FOR YEARS TO COME AS WE START TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SO THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY. MY FAMILY CAME TO THE UNITED STATES SO MY DAD'S SIDE IN NINETEEN ELEVEN TO NINETEEN SEVENTEEN FROM MEXICO. THE CAMERA CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY FOR OPPORTUNITY MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS MY GRANDPARENTS MY DOT ALL WORKED THE FIELDS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY MY GRANDMOTHER WORKED ALONGSIDE SAYS ARE CHAVEZ. AND THE CALIFORNIA THAT MY FAMILY CAME TO THE GOLDEN CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY CAME HERE FOR. OUR DWINDLING DESPITE THEIR GRANDDAUGHTER SITTING HERE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE DRIVING LATINOS AND LATINO FAMILIES OUT OF CALIFORNIA. THE HIGH COST OF LIVING THE LACK OF ACCESS TO QUALITY CHILDCARE. I THINK PART OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU HERE THOUGH. IT'S TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT ONE OF MY BIGGEST PRIORITIES WHICH IS CHILD CARE AND ACCESS TO QUALITY PRESCHOOL. WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE LATINO WORK FORCE HAS ACCESS TO TOP QUALITY CHILD CARE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE THE PROVIDERS AS WELL THEY'RE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THIS INDUSTRY IS LOOKING AT LOSING A THIRD TO HALF OF THIS INDUSTRY AND THESE ARE NOT THE NOT BUSINESS OWNERS. WHAT IN YOUR OPINION CAN WE BE DOING TO PROMOTE SO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THE SECOND QUESTION WHEN I'M OPPOSE HERE. IS WHAT CAN WE BE DOING TO PROMOTE FINANCIAL LITERACY ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG LATINAS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS TO DEVELOP. THEIR OWN FINANCIAL STRATEGIES FOR THEIR LIVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF LETTING OUR BUSINESSES AND THIS IS- HOPEFULLY DR LOPEZ HAS SOME OF THIS INFORMATION. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE LEADING A BUSINESS OWNERS R. S. CERT RECEIVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND HOW CAN WE HELP THEM TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE ESPECIALLY IN THEIR START UP PHASES. THANKS SO REAL QUICK BEFORE I GO ON CLARIFY I WILL I WAS IN THIS IS HARDLY SEEN PREVIOUS COMMENT THAT THOSE JOBS WERE BAD. YES THERE ARE GREAT JOBS I WAS JUST SAYING IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO STILL REACH THINK ABOUT RETRAINING AND SEE HOW WE COULD MOVE THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE UNIONIZED JOBS AND DON'T HAVE THOSE. JOBS WITH BENEFITS FOR IT- GOING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT ENTREPRENEURSHIP- I THINK YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF YOUR FINANCIAL LITERACY I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. I THINK PARTNERING YOU KNOW WITH LOCAL BANKS I THINK GETTING LOCAL BANKS TO TAKE. A BIGGER ROLE IN IN PREDOMINANTLY LATINO COMMUNITIES ARE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS CAN CAN BE A WAY TO INCREASE THAT FINANCIAL LITERACY- I THINK IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HOW MANY OF THEM- ARE ARE OF THE- SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION R RECEIVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS- I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT DONE UP ON HIM AND- BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT CHIU CHOI KIND OF SUPPORT. DOES ENTREPRENEURIAL EFFORTS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AGAIN YOU KNOW THE WORKING WITH THOSE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO FIND. IN A WAYS WHERE THEY CAN CONNECT TO REALLY SEE WHAT THE STRUGGLES OF LATINO BUSINESS OWNERS ARE- I THINK THERE IS AGAIN THE BIG ACCESS TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL IS DISCRIMINATION THAT THEY FACED WHEN THEY'RE LYING- THERE IS YOU KNOW I'M ALSO THEY DON'T. FEEL NECESSARILY COMFORTABLE. WORKING WITH THE BANKS BECAUSE BANKS SOMETIMES PLAY A VERY SMALL ROLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO INCREASING THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL BANKS COULD SORT OF INCREASE TRUST AND COULD LEAD TO MORE OPPORTUNITIES ON AND ACCESS. TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL. IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THE LOOK. COMMENTS HOPE- I DID US. FOCUS GROUP STUDY HOPE WERE I. ENTER. AND ARE. AT SPOKE WITH SEVERAL MICRO BUSINESS ON. IN CITIES OF THE STATE AND WE DID FIND EXACTLY WHAT DOCTOR LOOK AS MENTIONED BUT WE ALSO AND IN ADDITION TO THAT FOUND THAT- BUT- MICHAEL LET THE AMERICAN BUSINESS OWNERS. AREN'T ALWAYS PREPARED. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE MOST OF SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES SO THEY MAY BE AWARE THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO GET THE ARM. TO GET MORE INFORMATION TO GET EDUCATED ABOUT THESE ISSUES BUT IT MIGHT BE ACROSS TOWN SO THEY'RE IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA OR THE LOS ANGELES AREA AND IT GOT TO GET. ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY PUTTING IN. A FULL TIME. JOB AND THEN THEY COME HOME MAKE DINNER AND THEN THEY YOU KNOW SPEND TWO OR THREE HOURS ON THEIR- THEIR- MICRO BUSINESS. FOR SOMEONE TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ALWAYS YOU KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF RESOURCES YOU JUST HAVE TO GET THEIR TO GO AN HOUR THERE. NO TWO HOURS FOR THE TRAINING AND THEN AND THEN COME HOME AND START THE WHOLE THING AGAIN. THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING IN ADDITION TO THAT WE FOUND THAT A LOT OF THE WOMEN ARE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE IT YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BIG IDEAS BUT THEY HAVEN'T. THEY DON'T HAVE A WRITTEN BUSINESS PLAN THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE THAT THE BANKS ARE GOING TO BE ASKING THEM FOR WHEN THEY COME IN. WHEN THEY FINALLY GET THE NERVE TO CONNECT YOU TO THE BANKS BANKS YOU CAN EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT THEY JUST DON'T HAPPEN. SO THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR LATINOS TO GET. THOSE DOCUMENTS IN ORDER BUT THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE- IN ADDITION TO THAT- HOPE DOES. HOST OF FINANCIAL LITERACY CONVENING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR EVERY YEAR IN DIFFERENT CITIES. AND. THERE IS A DEMAND FOR THAT. ALBUM IS THAT THERE'S THE GROUP DEMAND SO- THAT YOU'VE GOT EVERYONE. A FIVE YOU OLD READ COLLEGE GRAD. OF WHO MAY. YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOME BASIC BUDGETING SITTING NEXT TO A- YOU KNOW. A WOMAN WHO'S APPROACHING FORTY WITH YEAH THREE OR FOUR KIDS AND YOU KNOW WAS TRYING TO. MANAGE THEIR BEYOND. THE BUDGET FOR AN ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD SITTING NEXT TO A WOMAN WHO IS MAYBE YOU KNOW. HAS A LARGER INCOME MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME AND HER QUESTIONS MIGHT BE REALLY NOT ABOUT BASIC BUDGETING BUT ABOUT. THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO- TO INCREASE HER RETIREMENT ACCOUNT OR EMAIL THE BEST WAYS TO THINK ABOUT. RETIRING DID SHE PUT HOW MUCH MONEY AYE REVERSES YOU KNOW FIRST OF THE DIFFERENT PRODUCT. SO YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS TREMENDOUS NEED AND YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO BE ABLE TO- TO ADDRESS ALL OF THAT NEED IN YEAH ONE. WHEN YOU HAVE JUST ONE OPPORTUNITY- SO THERE'S A TREMENDOUS NEED BUT WE ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW TO MATCH UP. THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING WITH WHERE. THE WOMEN ARE AND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. THANK YOU. I'M THANK YOU I'M GONNA GO WITH LET'S I'M WORRIED WE'RE GOING TO OUT OF TIME THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS ARE HUGE I ANTICIPATE WILL BE- RELYING ON SOME OF THESE- IN ALL OF THESE WOMEN- IN THE FUTURE FOR TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME POLICY PROPOSALS THAT REALLY GET OUT- HOW WE- HOW WE ADDRESS THIS COMING OUT OF. OUT OF THE PANDEMIC BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC OBVIOUSLY HAS HAD HEALTH EFFECTS HEALTH EFFECTS ON LATINAS IN PARTICULAR AND SO. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON NOW TO THE SECOND GROUP OF PANELISTS. FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM OTHER JANAB RAMOS. YEAH I'M A MODEL. I HOPE WE CAN GET PULL HER UP. A POLICY ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER OTHER ANNA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS ADRIANA I'M POLICY ANALYST AT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH OUR WORK WE ENGAGE IN INDEPENDENT FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYSIS AND PUBLIC EDUCATION WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW AND MIDDLE INCOMES. OUR VISION IS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE'S ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE. I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE OTHER NINETEEN PANDEMIC ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HIGHLIGHTING LATIN NEXT CALIFORNIANS AND HOW WE GOT THERE. I SHOULD MENTION WE DO HAVE A REPORT COMING OUT IN A FEW WEEKS ON THIS TOPIC SO PLEASE STAY TUNED FOR THAT YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR OUR UPDATES. OUR WEBSITE CAL BUDGET CENTER YEAR INTO THE PANDEMIC OVER THREE POINT ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COLBERT NINETEEN. AND OVER THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED DUE TO THE VIRUS. THESE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS FRIENDS FRONTLINE WORKERS AND MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE GETTING SICK AND ARE DYING. THIS IS A DEVASTATING LOSS AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THE ONLY DISPARITIES FACING PEOPLE OF COLOR AT MID AMID THE PANDEMIC. AS YOU ALL KNOW OR HAVE HEARD BY NOW THE VIRUS IS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LET THE NEXT CALIFORNIANS ARE ESPECIALLY HARD HIT. THE ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY 55% OF CASES. IN 46% OF DEATHS YET THEY REPRESENT JUST AROUND 39% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ALSO THE CHARTS MY COLLEAGUE MONICA DOUGLAS AND I HAVE PUT TOGETHER HI I LIKE THESE RACIAL. THE DATA ABOUT A WEEK OLD BUT WILL STILL HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- DILLON FULL. THE UP. WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WE'VE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS SEEN CHARTS SO YOU MAY HAVE TO JUST TALK US THROUGH IT. IF THAT'S POSSIBLE NO PROBLEM. I THINK I AM THE- CAN YOU ALL. NOW OKAY GREAT I THINK THE NODDING HEADS. OKAY SO THIS CHART SHOWS COPA NINETY IN CASE RATES BY RACE ETHNICITY THAT ARE ADJUSTED FOR AGE AS YOU CAN SEE A NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND OTHER-PACIFIC ISLANDER CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF COVERT NINETEEN INFECTIONS FOLLOWED BY A LOT NEXT CALIFORNIANS THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS FOR WHY RECINE THIS SOME PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE HIGHER RISK OF INFECTION PARTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN ESSENTIAL SERVICES. LIVE IN MULTI GENERATIONAL HOMES AND LACK ACCESS TO WORK BETTER THAT'S THAT ALLOWED ME TO STAY HOME IF THEY'RE SICK. THIS NEXT CHART SHOWS CODE NINETY THREE CALORIES BY RACE ETHNICITY THAT ARE ALSO ADJUSTED FOR AGE. JUST AS YOU SAW IN THE CASE RATES RACIAL DISPARITIES ARE APPARENT IN KOBE NINETEEN DEATH RATES. YOU COULD SEE THAT LATIN NEXT NEED OF HAWAIIAN AND OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER AND BLACK CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST RATES OF DEATH DUE TO CULVERT NINETEEN. THESE DISPARITIES ARE ALARMING CONSIDERING THAT THE LOT NEXT POPULATION IS GENERALLY YOUNGER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS YEAH ARE DYING FROM COVERT NINETEEN AT SUCH HIGH RATES. AND T'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE AGE INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THE RISK FOR SEVERE ILLNESS AND EVEN DEATH FROM COVERT NINETEEN INCREASES AS A PERSON THEN GETS OLDER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME CALIFORNIA COLOR HAVE HIGHER RATES OF UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS AND HAVE LESS ACCESS TO HEALTH COVERAGE. FOR INSTANCE LET NEXT CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT FAIR OR POOR HEALTH AND TO BE UNINSURED. ABOUT ONE IN FIVE LATIN NEXT CALIFORNIANS DID NOT HAVE A USUAL SOURCE OF CARE AND ONE IN SIX EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY FINDING A SPECIALIST. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC LACK OF ACCESSIBLE AND QUALITY HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. ENTERED A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM RECEIVING PROPOFOL PREVENTIVE CARE TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC DISEASES AND SEEKING TREATMENT WHEN NEEDED DUE TO THE COST. WE ALSO KNOW THAT LATIN NEXT ADULTS AS WELL AS BLACK AND AMERICAN INDIAN ADULTS EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF OBESITY IN CALIFORNIA AND HAVING OF CITY IS CONSIDERED TO BE A RISK FACTOR FOR SEVERE ILLNESS. FROM COVERT NINETEEN. AND IF WE COULD TAKE ONE STEP BACK AND ASK WHY DO WE SEE RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. WELL WE COULD SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY UNPACKING THIS BUT IT ALL REALLY BOILS DOWN TO RACISM. DUE TO HISTORIC AND ONGOING RACIST POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT PART CHILDREN FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS FROM EQUAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE EMPLOYMENT HOUSING EDUCATION AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO THRIVE. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THEM MORE VULNERABLE TO HEALTH THREATS LIKE COVERT NINETEEN. THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT DOCUMENTS HOW RACISM PERSISTS IN VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND HOW THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS HEALTH BUT LET ME JUST HIGHLIGHT ONE CONCRETE EXAMPLE. OUR ENVIRONMENT EVERYONE DESERVES TO LIVE IN A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK AND LATIN NEXT CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WITH POOR AIR QUALITY. AND IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO HAZARD IS WASTE SITES THAN WHITE CALIFORNIANS. ALSO BLACK LATIN NEXT AND ASIAN CALIFORNIANS ARE ON AVERAGE EXPOSED TO MORE POLLUTION FROM VEHICLES LIKE CARS TRUCKS AND BUSES AS THEN WHITE CALIFORNIANS. AND THIS IS NOT ACCIDENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ARE DEEPLY ROOTED IN RACIST POLICIES AND ACTIONS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION REDLINING SEGREGATION UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF POWER AND DISINVESTMENT FROM COMMUNITIES. HARMFUL CHEMICALS AND POLLUTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT IRRITATE THE LUNGS AND CONTRIBUTE TO RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING ASTHMA A LUNG CANCER AND HEART DISEASE. THESE TOXIC UNHEALTHY CONDITIONS ARE HARMFUL TO HEALTH AND IT ALSO INCREASES THE RISK OF SEVERE ILLNESS FROM COVERT NINETEEN. A RECENT STUDY IN FACT FOUND AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LONG TERM EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION AND A COUNTY'S COVERT NINETEEN MORTALITY RATE. SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT THESE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE LIVE LEARN WORK PLAY AN AGE I'M REFERRING TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WHICH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM BLATT MENTIONED EARLIER. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HEALTH AND ACTUALLY HAS A MUCH GREATER IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES THAN MEDICAL CARE. IN OTHER WORDS BECAUSE OF ONGOING AND HISTORIC RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION THE CONTEXT OF A COMMUNITY OR WHERE A PERSON LIVES MATTERS. FOR THEIR OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING SO IT'S ALL IN HERE BUT YOU CAN FIND MORE OF OUR WORK INCLUDING OUR UPCOMING REPORT ON THIS TOPIC ON OUR WEBSITE CAL BUDGET CENTER DOT ORG. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING US TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT CHANNEL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS. GIVE THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR MAHDI LANDED THAT THREE KNOW THAT YOUNG. A PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSOR UC MERCED. GOOD AFTERNOON. AS CHAIR WOMEN GONZALEZ MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND MY FELLOW PANELISTS. MY GRANDMOTHER LISA WAS BORN INTO THE VEST NICARAGUA IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THE YEAR OF THE SPANISH FLU. I'M LAST YEAR AT THE AGE OF A HUNDRED INTO SHE CONTRACTED CODE NINETEEN. FORTUNATELY SHE SURVIVED BUT IN THE PROCESS OF CARING FOR HER. EACH OF THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY ALSO CONTRACTED COULD NINETEEN. SO AS A MEMBER OF. CALIFORNIA'S LATINO POPULATION THIS HEARING TODAY IS DEEPLY PERSONAL FOR ME AND I THINK YOUR PREP LIFTING THE VOICES OF LATINOS ACROSS THE STATE. AS AN IMMIGRANT HEALTH RESEARCHER THE WELL BEING OF LATINO IMMIGRANTS HAS BECOME INTEGRAL TO MY WORK OVER THE LAST YEAR. MY PRIMARY MESSAGE TODAY IS THAT. NOT ONLY HAS CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC EXACERBATED HEALTH INEQUITIES FOR LET YOU KNOW AS A WHOLE. BUT IT HAS DEEP IN THE INEQUITIES IN HEALTH THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR STATE'S DIVERSE LATINO POPULATION BASED ON CITIZENSHIP AND LEGAL STATUS. AMONG CALIFORNIA'S THAT THE ENOUGH ABOUT 20% LACK THE PROTECTIONS OF CITIZENSHIP. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC ABOUT 50% OF THESE NONCITIZEN LEFT IN US THIS INCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED WOMEN WOMEN WITH DACA TPS AND EVEN GREEN HEARTS LACKED HEALTH INSURANCE. STUDIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE US HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT NONCITIZEN LATINOS ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A REGULAR SOURCE OF HEALTH CARE EVEN IF THEY HAVE INSURANCE. WHEN THE CALL NINETEEN PANDEMIC STARTED I INITIATED THE YOU MUST STUDY A STUDY OF KOBE NINETEEN AND LET YOU KNOW FAMILIES AND IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIA TRIDENTINE FIND HOW THE PANDEMIC. WAS AFFECTING THE WELL BEING OF LATINO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND STOP OR STATES HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. I HAVE SHARED YOUR RESEARCH BRIEF WHICH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM WITHOUT ALREADY REFERRED TO AND THANK YOU FOR READING THAT QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE WOMEN IN TULARE COUNTY WE INTERVIEWED. MY TEAM CONDUCTED IN DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH TWENTY ONE IMMIGRANT LATINOS IN MERCED. FRESNO TULARE AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES. THE STUDY RESPONDENTS WERE INDIVIDUALS WHO ALREADY FACE SIGNIFICANT COST LANGUAGE AND ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS TO HELP. WE COMPLEMENTED THESE INTERVIEWS WITH SEVENTEEN INTERVIEWS WITH IMMIGRANT SERVING ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ALREADY SERVING AS THE SAFETY NET FOR THIS POPULATION TODAY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THREE FINDINGS THAT RAISED SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS. ABOUT THE LONG TERM WELL BEING OF THAT THE- FIRST I'D LIKE TO REPORT OUR FINDINGS REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH. RESPONDENTS ACROSS COUNTIES DESCRIBED HEIGHTENED ANXIETY DEPRESSION SLEEP PROBLEMS AND OTHERSIGNS THE MOTION ALL AND MENTAL DISTRESS. IS MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES REALLY EMERGED AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE EXCLUSION THAT LATINOS ALREADY FACE AS IMMIGRANTS AND WITH THE NEW STRAINS OF THE PANDEMIC SO MOTHERS MANY OF WHOM HAD TO LEAVE WHO HAD TO LEAVE THE WORKFORCE BASE STRESSED OVER MODES SCHOOLING. AND OFTEN DESCRIBED THEIR OWN SPOUSES AND CHILDREN DETERIORATING MENTAL HEALTH. FAMILIES FACE FINANCIAL. AND RESULTING STRESS AS THEY STRUGGLE TO MEET BASIC NEEDS. NUMEROUS RESPONDED SHARED A SENSE OF DISCRIMINATION FROM BEING EXCLUDED FROM POLICIES SUCH AS THE FEDERAL STIMULUS WERE ALSO A SOURCE OF STRESS FOR THEM AND OF COURSE RESPONDENTS HAD FEW ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AND THE FEW THAT DID. FOUND THAT THE REMOTE MOVED TO REMOTE ONLINE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT WAS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER. SECOND OUR REPORT OUR FINDINGS AROUND FOOD AND SECURITY MOST RESPOND RESPOND RESPOND AS REPORTED INCREASED USE OF EMERGENCY FOOD RESOURCES SUCH AS FOOD BANKS AND PANTRIES. WITH SCHOOLS CLOSED FAMILIES YOU HAD TO FEED CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND HAD LIMITED ACCESS TO TAKE AWAY SCHOOL MEALS LOST INCOME AND VOLATILE FOOD PRICES MADE FOOD PURCHASES VERY DIFFICULT. AND DESPITE CONNECTING WITH CHARITY FEED RESOURCES RESPONDENTS OFTEN HAD TO DEDICATE HOURS TO LINING UP FOR FOOD DONATIONS. SOMETIMES ONLY TO BE TURNED AWAY WHEN FOOD BOXES RIGHT NOW. RESPONDENTS ALSO REPORTED CONCERN ABOUT THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF PRESERVED FOODS OFTEN PROVIDED BY FOOD BANKS. FINALLY I WANT TO REPORT ON THE IMPACT OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC CHARGE ROLE AND THE IMPACT IT'S HAD TO LET YOU KNOW IMMIGRANTS DURING THE COULD NINETEEN CONDEMNED. IN OUR INTERVIEWS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS. RESPONDENTS REPORTED CONCERNS THAT LEAVE THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF USING PUBLIC BENEFITS. AND THE SOCIAL STIGMA AROUND IMMIGRANTS USE THE PUBLIC BENEFITS. HAD EXACERBATED LET THE MOST FAMILIES BARRIERS TO CRITICAL HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICE AND ECONOMIC RESOURCES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS A FEDERAL POLICY AND IT'S LIKELY TO CHANGE UNDER NEW PRESIDENT. THERE ARE WHAT ARE LIKELY GOING TO BE LASTING BARRIERS TO SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED BY STATE LOCAL AND EVEN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. WE HEARD THAT PUBLIC CHARGES COMPLEXITIES AND ITS INTERSECTIONS WITH ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MANY STATE PROGRAMS HAS INCREASED THE BURDEN ON IMMIGRANTS SERVICE PROVIDERS AS THEY STRUGGLE TO MEET THEIR CLIENTS NEEDS. AND HAD REDUCE DISTRUST AMONG IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WELL THE HELP OUTLOOK FOR LATINAS AT THIS MOMENT IS DISCOURAGING I WILL END MY REMARKS BY HIGHLIGHTING THE CRITICAL ROLE OF OUR STATE'S POLICIES. THAT THEY'VE ALREADY PLAYED REALLY IN ADDRESSING HEALTH INEQUITIES- BECAUSE OF GREAT WORK BECAUSE OF FROM POLICY MAKERS LIKE YOU CALIFORNIA NATIONALLY IT'S BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT. OF ENACTING PUBLIC POLICIES THAT CREATE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROTECTIONS FOR ITS IMMIGRANT RESIDENTS. I STUDY A STATE LEVEL IMMIGRANT POLICY EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICIES THAT EXTEND ELIGIBILITY RIGHTS AND OTHER PROTECTIONS TO NONCITIZENS AND INSURANCE HEALTH INSURANCE RATES. I'VE SHARED A FACT SHEET THAT SUMMARIZES THE STUDY'S KEY FINDINGS. AND IN THIS STUDY I SCORED ALL FIFTY STATES BASED ON THE ENACTMENT OF TEN DIFFERENT POLICIES THAT EXPENSE EXTENT RIGHTS AND ELIGIBILITY TO NON CITIZENS. STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA SCORED VERY HIGH FOR HAVING POLICIES SUCH AS EXTENSION OF MEDIC HOW TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN. I'M STANDING DRIVER'S LICENSES TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. EXTENDING WORKER PROTECTIONS TO IMMIGRANTS DOMINANT SECTORS AND LIMITING COLLABORATION WITH ICE. I LINK THESE STATE SCORES WITH INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE DATA FROM THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY. AND CONDUCTED ANALYSES SHOWED THAT IN STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT HE DID NOT GIVE SIGNIFICANT INCLUSIVE POLICIES THERE WERE HIGHER RATES OF HEALTH INSURANCE AMONGST NON CITIZEN LEVINE ALSO THEN AND LESS WELCOMING STATE. THIS REALLY POINTS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC POLICY INTERVENTIONS ACROSS SECTORS NOT JUST IN HEALTH POLICY BUT AS MY FELLOW PANELISTS JUST MENTION ACROSS DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THESE POLICIES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN. DRESSING INEQUITIES IN WELL BEING BETWEEN US CITIZEN LEVINE AS AN IMMIGRANT UNITS. MOVING FORWARD ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND NUTRITION RESOURCES REGARDLESS OF LEGAL STATUS WILL BE CRITICAL TO HELP WITH THAT THE KNOWS. WHETHER THIS PANDEMIC IN THE LONGER TERM THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE TO BREAK DOWN BOTH LEGAL AND SOCIAL BARRIERS TO LATINO IMMIGRANTS RIGHT TO HELP. THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY THOROUGH- WE ARE NOW GOING TO HEAR FROM ROSA. MARIA AND REGISTERED NURSE AT UC SAN FRANCISCO IN CHIEF NURSE REPRESENTATIVE WITH CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. GROSSA. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND FELLOW PANELISTS. MY NAME IS ROSS I'VE YET WELL I AM A REGISTERED NURSE WITH THE CALIFORNIA. NURSES ASSOCIATION AND ITS CHIEF NURSE RIGHT FOR UCSF MISSION BAY. IDENTIFY AS AN INDIGENOUS MICHAEL G. LET YOU KNOW WOMAN BORN TO IMMIGRANT PARENTS IT'S FROM SHEILA. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND SHARE HOW THE CODEPENDENT MAKE HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT. ACTED IN PATIENTS ON THE FIRST. AND ALSO THE LAST UNITY AS A WHOLE OF COURSE WE ALL FIRST LETTER TO THE CODEPEN DEDICATE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WATCHED IN HORROR AS IT'S MADE ITS WAY WORLDWIDE. I JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY MY COLLEAGUES AND I WITH THE BACKING OF CNA ARE NURSES UNION. WE'RE STARTING TO ASK SOME VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. HOW PREPARED ARE WE AS A HOSPITAL. WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING TO MITIGATE THIS IMPENDING PANDEMIC. AS A HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THE POTENTIAL FOR ANOTHER MASSIVE PANDEMIC TO OCCUR. WE HAD JUST A BIRDIE BOLA AND FOUGHT HARD TO MAKE SURE HOSPITALS WERE PREPARED FOR THAT VIRUS. WE KNOW WAS NURSES WE CAN BE CALLED INTO BATTLE AGAINST MASS DISASTERS VIRUSES MASS CASUALTIES AND BEING IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR EARTHQUAKES. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING WE UNDERSTOOD IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME. WHAT TO SAY THAT WE ARE MENTALLY PREPARED FOR COLD IT AND HOW DEVASTATING IT WOULD BECOME. WOULD BE A LIE. WE KNEW THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WOULD BE THOSE ALREADY DISADVANTAGED IN SOCIETY. IT WOULD BE THE BLACK INDIGENOUS AND LATIN NEXT COMMUNITY. YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW HISTORY AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. ALREADY PREDESTINED THIS AUTUMN. THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT ME AND MY COLLEAGUES WERE NOT PREPARED FOR. INCLUDING THE COMPLETE INCOMPETENCE OF THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION THE WEAKENING OF THE CDC. AND THE INTERACTIVE OFFICE OF CAL OSHA AND THE UNWILLINGNESS OF HOSPITALS TO PURSUE THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. TO BE SUCCINCT. THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE IS AN APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT THAT ENSURES THAT WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH YOU GO ABOVE AND BEYOND TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THOSE INVOLVED DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN NOT THE LEAST YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH. MY COLLEAGUE CNA AND I'D HAVE INSISTED THAT HOSPITALS APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE. SORRY TO THE CODEPENDENT ACT WHICH INCLUDES A DEMAND FROM ALL WORKPLACES. THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TRAINING AND HANDS ON ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. TO THE DETRIMENT OF MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES INCLUDING THE MOST SMALLER POPULATIONS THAT I MENTIONED THE HOSPITAL'S FAILED TO APPLY THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. AS A CONSEQUENCE. ONCE THE PARK COMMUNITY WERE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE BLACK AND BROWN WORKERS TEND TO HAVE LESS JOB PROTECTIONS YOUR JOB SUFFER FROM JOB IN HOUSING AND SECURITY HAVE LITTLE OR NO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND LITTLE TO NO SICK TIME. WORKING IN MINIMUM WAGE JOB TO FEED YOUR FAMILY AND YOURSELF PAY BILLS. AND RENT LEAVE LITTLE TO COVER HEALTH CARE COSTS. THIS WAS EVIDENT PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC IN WAS EXACERBATED DURING COLD IT. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE IN HEALTHCARE HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT THERE'S A NEED TO ADDRESS EQUITABLE CARE. AS A NURSE OF TEN YEARS WORKING WITH CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS I SEE THE STRAIN ON FAMILY IS AS THEY CARE FOR LOVED ONES. BATTLING CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS OR DISEASE. I HAVE SEEN THE DESPERATION OF FAMILIES THAT STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY TO CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES. TOO OFTEN PAY FOR MEDICATIONS TO PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM APPOINTMENTS. I KNOW THAT PATIENTS WILL OFTEN WAIT UNTIL THE PAIN IS UNBEARABLE TO FINALLY COME INTO THE HOSPITAL. WE NEED TO WORK AND PAYING FOR A HSPITAL VISIT MEANS THERE IS LESS MONEY FOR FOOD OR SOME OTHER NECESSITY OR ITS TIME OFF WORK THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD. THESE ISSUES ARE EXACERBATED DURING COLD IT AS PEOPLE ARE LAID OFF THEY HAVE LOST HOUSING AND I'VE GOTTEN SICK. CARING FOR MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS IT IS THE SAME STORY THAT CYNTHIA LOPEZ SHARED EARLIER. HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT BE DETERMINED BY SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS BUT IN THE U. S. IT IS. COLD IT HAS MADE THAT VERY EVIDENT. ACCESS TO TESTING COVETED EDUCATION AND EVEN HOUSING AND FOOD ARE ALL INTEGRAL TO THE MITIGATION OF THE VIRUS. WE SAW THIS LOW OR NONEXISTENT ROLLOUT OF TESTING CENTERS IN VULNERABLE AREAS. IN SAN RAFAEL I ROLLINS HERE TO SWAPPING SITE IN A PREDOMINATELY LATIN EXPERIENCE. WHAT I SAW WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS TESTING POSITIVE. BUT WITH NO SUPPORT FINANCIALLY THEY WOULD RETURN TO WORK OR NOT ISOLATE DUE TO LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE CITY. WHAT THE MOTHERS WERE ALSO NOW HAVING TO CONTEND WITH HOME SCHOOLING ANOTHER ADDED RESPONSIBILITY TO ALREADY FULL PLATES. HOW DOES A FAMILY ISOLATE NOT WORKING FEED THEMSELVES WITHOUT FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR FOOD DELIVERY SERVICES THIS IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE. THE WORLD WILL POPULATION ISN'T JUST OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL WE ARE ALSO THE STAFF IN THE HOSPITAL THE SUPPORT STAFF FOUND ON EVERY UNIT. AND THE NURSES WHO CARE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THE COMMUNITY ARE ALSO NEEDED FOR THE- WORKERS ARCING LEADERSHIP TEAM AND I AT UCSF ASKED FOR WEEKLY TESTING OF ALL STAFF TIMELY CONTACT TRACING WOULD PROBABLY BE TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR PATIENTS I QUOTED STAFF TO MEET OUR ARGUMENTS PERSONAL I MAKE NOISE HOWEVER I COULD. WE MAKE NOISE. WE. MY UNION BROTHERS AND SISTERS ACROSS THE UC SYSTEM MAKE NOISE TO KEEP THE PRESSURE UP BUT WE'RE STILL RE USING OUR AND NINETY FIVES REUSING ARE SINGLE USE PP WE ARE STILL SHORT STAFFED AND ARE STILL RAISING OUR CONCERNS WE SEE TOO OFTEN IN MONEY PROFITS OVER PATIENT CARE HOW DO WE PROVIDE EQUITABLE CARE WHEN THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY CREATES BARRIERS OR TIES OUR HANDS BEHIND OUR BACK. OUT SIDE OF THE COMMUNITY. THE LOT NEXT COMMUNITY WAS NOT RECEIVED. TIMELY ACCURATE OR CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE RESOURCES OR INFORMATION. THIS HAS LED TO AN EFFECTIVE OUTREACH. FUELED BY RACIST RHETORIC FROM THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION. THERE HAS BEEN AN INFORMATION VACUUM THAT HAS LED TO THE LACK OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATA. TO CAPTURE THE IMPACT OF COATED ON WHAT NEXT UNITIES. THIS WAS EVIDENT BY THE FAILURE OF THE CDC. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION STATES QUOTE. HE CALLED DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTH DAMAGING EXPERIENCES IS NOT IN ANY SENSE AND NATURAL PHENOMENON WHAT IS THE RESULT OF TOXICOLOGY OF COURSE SOCIAL POLICIES UNFAIR ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENTS AND BAD POLITICS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS CAN INCLUDE UNEMPLOYMENT INCOME EDUCATION WORKING CONDITIONS FOOD AND SECURITY HOUSING SOCIAL INCLUSION DISCRIMINATION STRUCTURAL CONFLICT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH SERVICES AND EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES SUFFER FROM HIGHER RATES OF OBESITY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE LIVER DISEASE DIABETES REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DISPARITIES HIGHER RATES OF BREAST CANCER TO WOMAN INFECTION CAN EXACERBATE THESE CONDITIONS LEADING TO HIGHER INFECTION AND DEATH RATES. MORTALITY RATE TRANSCODED ARE THREE TO FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN OUR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE LET NEXT COMMUNITY MY COMMUNITY WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT MY COMMUNITY IS MADE UP OF THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS OF CALIFORNIA WITH JOBS IN AGRICULTURE RETAIL RESTAURANT INDUSTRY LABOR CONSTRUCTION AND HEALTH CARE. WE'D A LOT THE NASS ARE THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE ARE OFTEN EXPLOITED AS THE EVER READY BUT EASILY FIRED OFTEN NON UNIONIZED WORKFORCE WITH WILL. LITTLE OR NO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE SOCIAL ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY DUE TO OVER REPRESENTATION OF THE LOT NEXT COMMUNITY AND LOW WAGE LABOR MARKET. IS A DIRECT CORRELATION TO POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES SO YOU ASK HOW DO WE TACKLE THESE ISSUES HOW DO WE MOVE TOWARDS EQUITY AND HEALTH CARE AND SOCIETY. WE MUST WORK TO COORDINATE OUTREACH EFFORTS TO MARGINALIZE COMMUNITIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO ST CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS AND SERVICES. WE MUST HAVE CONSISTENT CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGNS OF INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS THAT ARE INCLUSIVE OF THE LOT NEXT COMMUNITY ANDY SYMPTOMS TESTING SITES RESOURCES VACCINE INFORMATION. WE MUST LEVERAGE TRUSTED COMMUNITY LEADERS BUILT ON THAT TRUST THAT ALREADY EXIST WITH THAT MANY COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. ONE OF THE BARRIERS TO TESTING IS THE THREAT OF IMMIGRATION PRESENCE THAT'S HAS CONTINUED CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. WE MUST ADVOCATE FOR BROADER SOCIETAL CHANGES. TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY FOR ALL ALL MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. WE MUST. WE MUST I'M SORRY WE MUST INVEST IN EQUITY IN ALL POPULATIONS BY HAVING SYSTEM. DIMS IN X. EQUAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE OR SINGLE PAYER INSURANCE LIVABLE WORKING WAGE IS CREATION OF UNIONS INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY PROGRAMS HEALTH CARE INITIATIVES IN ALL ASPECTS OF RACIAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE THAT IS HOW WE START TO BUILD A HEALTHIER FUTURE. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE CHOICE OF HEALTHCARE OVER HOUSING OR BILLS IT IS A TRAVESTY AND A FAILURE OF THIS NATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M WE'RE NOW GOING TO HEAR FROM FOURTEEN THAT OR NOT IS A FROM A TOYOTA WHO CAN SHARE HER EXPERIENCES WITH US AND- SHE'S GOING TO. HEARD TESTIMONIES CAN BE TRANSLATED BY ASHLEY. FORTY NINE.

AS PANELIST IS DOCTOR AQUINO. THE LATINO COALITION FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA'S DEPUTY DIRECTOR DR KENA. THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN GONZALEZ AND HIS TEAM TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM DOCTOR SAYS THE AQUINO DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT LATINOS ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF CONTRACTING AND DYING TO PROVIDE NINETEEN. DUE TO POOR OUTCOMES REFLECTED ACROSS ALL SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. STRUCTURAL RACISM AND ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION THAT PERPETUATES INEQUITY ANTENA PHOBIC SENTIMENTS THAT CONTINUE TO DAMAGE TRUST AND SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS HEALTH INEQUITIES PLAGUING MEDINA. IN DOING SO WE ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY INVESTING IN THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF FAMILIES COMMUNITIES THE STATE AND OUR ECONOMY. THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS ADDRESSING HEALTH INEQUITIES FOR LETTING US IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR DIGNITY AND POWER. LATINOS ARE NOT JUST LEADERS IN THE HOME BUT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES JOBS AND NETWORKS. WE PLAY MULTIPLE ROLES TO NAME JUST A FEW HEALTH NAVIGATORS CULTURAL BROKERS INVESTORS FINANCIAL MANAGERS AND EDUCATORS. THIS IS WHY IT IS OUR DUTY TO EXPLORE MULTI SECTORAL APPROACHES THAT WILL SEEK SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. LEADS LOUISE ALL WHILE PURSUING A CULTURE OF HEALTH. SOLUTIONS INCLUDE WINE ACHIEVE TRUE HEALTH FOR ALL. YOU WILL THE SHORT AND LONG TERM SOLUTION IS TO FULLY ACHIEVE HEALTH FOR ALL. COVERT NINETEEN EPIDEMIC THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS LOW INCOME WORKING AGE ADULTS AND SENIORS SERVES AS KEY EVIDENCE AS TO WHY IT IS TIME TO FULLY EXPAND ACCESS TO FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL FOR ALL. REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IT IS TIME TO EXPAND ACCESS AND NOT JUST TO SENIORS BUT ALSO TO WORKING AGE ADULTS. THIS INVESTMENT WILL NOT ONLY ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE DIRE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF COVERT NINETEEN BUT ALSO PREVENT DISPARITIES FROM ANY FUTURE PANDEMICS OR CLIMATE CHANGE CRISES THAT MIGHT COME OUR WAY.
