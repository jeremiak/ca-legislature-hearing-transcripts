MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE Y NELSON WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES I LIKE TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET CHAIR AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR -- OF THIS -- CRITICAL -- MEASURE -- MEMBERS ARE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES -- THIS IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US TO CLOSE CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES AND MAKE CALIFORNIA'S TAX GO FAIR WHILE SECURING FUNDING TO PROVIDE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS IN THE MOST VULNERABLE TAX. AND FAMILIES -- THAT ARE -- IMPACTED MOST BY OUR ECONOMY -- AS YOU SEEN THROUGHOUT THIS BUDGET PROCESS THEIR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WERE WORKING PEOPLE ARE WORKING HARD AND NEVER -- BUT THEY'RE STILL STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET CALIFORNIA'S FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALL OF OUR VIRTUES AND ECONOMIC VITALITY STILL HAS WON THE HIGHEST POVERTY RACE IN THE NATION -- MORE THAN EIGHT AND TEN CALIFORNIA CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA -- BUDGET POLICY CENTER -- COME FROM WORKING FAMILIES AND AS YOU ALL WELL TO NO NO -- TOO WELL WORKERS IN THE STATE CONTINUE TO FEEL THE STRAIN OF RISING RATES CHILDCARE FOOD AND OTHER DAILY NECESSITIES WHILE THEIR EARNINGS ARE FAILING TO KEEP PACE OF THESE COSTS. THIS BILL PROVIDES MECHANISM TO PROVIDE A CRITICAL BOOST TO WORKING CALIFORNIANS TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. AND BY BOOSTING THE MAXIMUM ELIGIBLE -- EARNED INCOME -- TO THOSE TO COVER THOSE MAKE AND UP TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR THIS BILL HELPS EXPAND ECONOMIC SECURITY TO MORE LOW WAGE WORKERS THAN EVER BEFORE -- THAT THIS BILL PROPOSES TO DO THIS -- IN BENEFIT THESE WORKERS BY CLOSING REASONABLE LOOPHOLES THAT BENEFIT LARGE CORPORATIONS WHILE OFFERING TAX RELIEF AS YOU'VE HEARD TO SMALL BUSINESSES.

BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONFORMITY BILL IS BOTH GOOD TAX POLICY AND GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. AND WE BELIEVE THE SIMPLIFICATION IS VERY IMPORTANT GIVEN WHERE WE STAND ON ALL THE TAX LAWS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONFORMITY PROVIDES MORE PREDICTABLE STABLE REVENUE STRUCTURE. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE STABILITY AND THE REVENUE STRUCTURE GOING TO HELP FUND OUR SCHOOLS BOTH K. TWELVE COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. AND THAT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS BECAUSE OF OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE. SO THEN WE ALSO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THE ROUND TABLE JUST COMPLETED A YEAR LONG STUDY -- JOBS POVERTY AN UPWARD MOBILITY AND OUR FINDINGS MADAM CHAIR.

MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JOHN KAT ATTACK AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE RIGHT TO THE NFIB NATIONAL FEDERATION INDEPENDENT BUSINESS AND WE TAKE IN A NEUTRAL POSITION -- BUT WE ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT THE THERE ARE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS WITHIN THE BILL THAT ARE VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR SMALL BUSINESS SIMPLIFYING THE ACCOUNTING RULES. AND THE PARTNERSHIP RULES VERY MUCH HELP SMALL BUSINESSES WITH THAT CERTAINTY THAT THEY NEED EVERY DAY ON THE TAX CREDIT PUTTING MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF ENTREPRENEURS ASPIRING ENTREPRENEURS STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I WHICH WE THINK ARE REALLY REALLY POSITIVE -- WE WOULD ASK -- WE WILL DO BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES IS IMPORTANT AND IF I BE IN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IS I'M ASKING TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN FOR A CONFORMING THAT THAT -- STATE TAX POLICY TO THE SECTION ONE NINETY NINE A WHICH IS THE SMALL BUSINESS DEDUCTION AND THE FEDERAL TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT. WE THINK THAT WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ADMIRABLE WITH THINGS IN HERE AND FOR THAT REASON WE TAKE IN NEUTRAL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- SILVIO FOR OUR HEARING BEHALF THE ASSOCIATION GLOBAL AUTOMAKERS -- I THINK I'M GONNA START BY BY STATING YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK% ON IT FOR THE LAST WEEK ON THIS BILL ON THE BUDGET BILL ABOUT CONFORMITY AND CONFORMING TO WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- CERTAINLY AS IT PERTAINS TO LIKE KIND EXCHANGE PROVISIONS -- IT IS NOT CONFORMITY -- IN THIS PROPOSAL WERE GRABBING THE UNFAVORABLE PROVISIONS WHICH IS THE REPEAL AND ELIMINATION OF LIKE KIND EXCHANGE AND WE ARE NOT GOING BACK TO REPLACE IT. AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID WITH FULL EXPENSING THEY DID THAT AND CREATE A PROCESS AT LEAST AT THE END THE DAY WHICH EVERYTHING REALLY KIND OF ZEROED OUT AND SO THERE WAS NO ECONOMIC CAT -- THIS REALLY BOILS DOWN TO UNFORTUNATELY -- A CAR TAX ON LEASING OF VEHICLES -- LIGHT CAN EXCHANGE HAS BEEN A VERY VERY HELPFUL TOOL TO BRING LEASED VEHICLES INTO THE MARKET -- AT A LOWER MORE COST EFFECTIVE PRICE -- OVER THE LAST MONTH WE HAVE BROUGHT NUMEROUS OPTIONS FORWARD -- I SIX OPTIONS VARIED IN DEGREE ALL IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A LIMITING LIKE KIND EXCHANGE NOT REPLACING IT WITH ANYTHING -- UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH WE'RE STILL IN A POSITION WHERE REALLY A HANDFUL OF MEMBERS MANY WHO DO A LOT OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDE A LOT OF ECONOMIC GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. ARE GOING TO BE HIT WITH 56% OF THE TOTAL -- THAT THE TOTAL BILL FOR THE LIKE KIND EXCHANGE PORTION THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS. THAT IS A VERY LARGE SUM TO TO PUT ON A ONE INDUSTRY -- SO AGAIN AS WE BROUGHT THESE PROVISIONS FORD -- AND WE'VE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IT MORE AND MORE WHAT HAS REALLY COME TO LIGHT IS -- WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PROTECT THOSE VEHICLES THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE MARKET THE VEHICLES THAT ARE GOING TO COME INTO THE MARKET BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE BILL. SO THAT THEY DO NOT END UP HAVING ANY TROUBLE MOVING FORWARD BUT THE REALITY IS THEY WERE BASED ON SOME KIND OF LEASING RATE AND A FINANCING DEAL. EXPECTING A LIKE KIND EXCHANGE IS GOING TO BE THERE AND NOW WE ARE CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME RIGHT UNDERNEATH THEM. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU WOULD LIKE TO WORK THE ADMINISTRATION EVERYONE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROTECT TO THAT GROUP OF VEHICLES -- BUT UNTIL WE CAN DO THAT WE CONTINUE OUR MAIN OPPOSE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE POINTS THAT THAT MY COLLEAGUE MADE -- CERTAINLY ARE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND THE MEASURE IS NOT ABOUT THE E. I. T. C. IT IS ABOUT THIS JUST THIS ONE PART OF THE BILL -- AND SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHTING THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE TWO CATEGORIES OF LEASES THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL ARE RETROACTIVE. AND SO WE'VE GOT LEASES ENTERED INTO AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE BILL AND THAT'S ONE SET OF LEASES. BUT THIS BILL IS RETROACTIVE AND APPLIES TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LEASES THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW DEALS THAT WERE MADE PEOPLE GETTING INTO THOSE VEHICLES BASED ON A KNOWN SET OF FACTORS BOTH. TAX AND FINANCIAL AND OTHERWISE THAT ARE NOW BEING THROWN INTO CHAOS HERE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THE RETROACTIVE NATURE OF OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. AND I THINK YOU KNOW -- FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW ON A LOOKING FORWARD BASIS -- THERE'S A THERE'S A POLICY DISCUSSION TO BE HAD BUT WE THINK IS A QUESTION OF FAIRNESS. PEOPLE OF ALREADY ENTERED INTO TRANSACTIONS -- SHOULD PROBABLY BE HELD HARMLESS BY THIS PROVISION OF THE BILL HI FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE POST. ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON PHILLIPPI POINT IS HERE ON BEHALF A NISSAN FOR THE LIKE KIND EXCHANGE REASONS THAT WERE MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUES. IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THAT IS. SEEN OVER THEIR OPPOSITION COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] IS RIVAS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY -- BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE I. T. C. EXPANSION WILL BENEFIT OUR HARDEST WORKING FAMILIES IN IN OUR STATE -- BUT I HAVE CONCERNS AND YOU KNOW MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED -- LETTERS -- WITH CONCERNS OF THE EXCLUSION OF I TEN FILERS FROM QUALIFYING FOR THE C. I. T. C. AND I KNOW UNDER SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THAT MENTION THIS -- TO I I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE CHILD IN -- A LOT OF TIMES THE CHURCH THE CHILDREN OF I TEN FILERS ARE US CITIZENS -- AND IN THESE FAMILIES SHOULD BE BENEFITING FROM THIS CREDIT YOU KNOW IS IT YOUR INTENT OR IN THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. TWO OF INCLUDE THEM OR EXCLUDING I'M JUST I JUST WANT SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT SO THIS THAT THIS BILL IS -- A PART OF OUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS -- BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE INCLUDED I TEN FILERS IN EACH OF THEIR YEAH I. T. C. BUDGET PROPOSALS WE WERE NOT ABLE. TO REACH AGREEMENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT PARTICULAR ITEM. I IMAGINE IT'S BEEN THERE WILL BE DISCUSSING NEXT YEAR BUT THE FIRST FOR NOW AND THIS BILL IT DOES NOT INCLUDE. YOU KNOW I THINK BEFORE I VOTE ON THE FLOOR I WOULD LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON WHY THE I TEN PILAR'S WORKS COLLUDED IF. WE HAVE ANY WHAT DOES. IF THERE IS ANYONE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT HERE WE WE SO FOR FOR THIS LEGISLATION PARTICULAR WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALEJO -- TO PROVIDE ANY SORT OF BACKGROUND WITH FTP SO -- MISTER -- HE'S HE'S ONE OFTEN IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND I THINK YOU CAN EXPLAIN SOME THINGS THANK YOU. HI THERE VEGAS WHEN OFTEN CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HER SORRY. YESTERDAY I KNOW SEEMS ODD. YOU'RE NOT BEING APPLIED. YES SO -- AS MR TING MENTION IN THE DELIBERATIONS THIS WAS REAL EIGHT MOST OF OUR DELIBERATIONS WERE AROUND HOW MUCH ONE TIME VERSUS ON GOING SPENDING WE HAVE IN OUR BUDGET AND ALTHOUGH THE OVERALL SURPLUS NUMBER. OF TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION -- OUR CALCULATION IS THAT MOST OF THAT MONEY IN THE SURPLUS IS ONE TIME AS MUCH AS A NEARLY 90% WERE AS A PROGRAM LIKE THE EITC IS AN ONGOING PROGRAM. SO WE FACE SOME TRADE OFFS IN DESIGNING THIS SPECIFIC PROGRAM IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH DEBT DO THE OVERALL EXPANSION VERSES INCLUDING YOU POPULATIONS AND THIS IS WHAT IN THE AGREEMENT WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE THIS YEAR BUT CERTAINLY. IF THE FISCAL SITUATION IMPROVES IN FUTURE YEARS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT IN IN JUST JUST TO CLARIFY THE WAY THAT THE AGREEMENT WENT WAS. ARMED -- THERE WAS REALLY DESIRE TO GET UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND TO GET THAT INCOME LEVEL SO IT MEANT A LITTLE BIT OF A TRADE OFF WHERE. YOU QUICKLY HAVE DONE MORE FOR THE CURRENT INCOME POPULATION WE SITE TO EXPAND. TO THE HIGHER INCOME POPULATION BUT IT MEANT THAT PER. PER FAMILY THEY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO AS MUCH SO THAT'S PART OF THE TRADE OFF AS WELL -- YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE AND I REALLY HOPE -- THAT THAT IS THE CASE YOU KNOW I THINK I TEN FAMILIES AND FILERS CONTRIBUTE. A LOT TO OUR STATE AND I THINK THEY ALSO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS CREDIT AND THAT'S SOMETHING. I WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON AND MAKING SURE THAT. WE DO INCLUDE THEM. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU BRING UP AN EXTRA POINT AGAIN -- THIS IS A TAX CREDIT FOR WORKING FAMILIES SO IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO INCLUDE ALL WORKING FAMILIES IN THAT IN THAT TAX CREDITS AGAIN. THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE ABLE TO GET DONE THIS TIME WE WOULD ANTICIPATE BRING IT UP NEXT YEAR. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I REMEMBER GRAY. FOR THE RECORD. I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH CONGENIALITY AMONGST YOUR SCORE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- AND THANK YOU. GERMAN THING FOR YOUR PRESENTATION HERE TODAY AND FOR ALL THE HARD WORK ON THE BUDGET. ON YOUR PREPARATION. FOR THIS HEARING. I DO HOMEWORK AND WENT BACK AND AS YOU KNOW. THE SHOOTING AS RANMA COLLEGE NO THIS IS MY NINETEENTH YEAR. WORKING HERE IN THIS INSTITUTION IN SOME SOME LEVEL OR ANOTHER AND I'VE NEVER SEEN IN NINETEEN YEARS SO MUCH CONSTERNATION. ATTACK CONFORMITY. SO I THOUGHT WELL I'M GETTING OLD MY HAIR'S GETTING GRAY MAYBE I FORGOT. AND I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AND YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE A THEY ALWAYS CONFORMED THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONFORMITY BOTH SPECIFIC AND THEN KIND OF MORE ON THE BY STATE APPROPRIATE. IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS WITH THEM BOTH. RIGHT -- SPECIFICALLY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY TEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WE DID SPECIFIED CONFORMITY WHICH LOCK YOUR BILL IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND WE ALL I THINK ACCEPT CONFORMITY IT IS KIND OF A BASIC GOOD TENNIS RIGHT THIS IS IT IS BETTER BETTER COMPLIANCE LESS PENALTIES -- EASIER ON THE TAXPAYER WHICH IS WHY WE WE DO THOSE THINGS EVEN THOUGH OUR STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFTENTIMES. CAN'T FIND AGREEMENT ON MORE GENERAL POLICY ISSUES. AND I WHILE I DON'T ACCEPT CONFORMITY IS JUST A BLANK CHECK GOOD THING BECAUSE CONFORM WITH BAD FEDERAL TAX POLICY IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING I THINK WE WANT. TO AVOID AND I THINK IN SOME DEGREE THE PACKAGE THAT MR TANG AND LEADERSHIP NEGOTIATED -- IS A LITTLE JUICE RIGHT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES. BUT YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER HAND -- BOB LET ME GIVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE SIX SAMPLE OF OF TAX CONFORMITY WHY WOULDN'T WOULDN'T WANNA SUPPORTERS -- SO SCARED INCOME RIGHT THIRTY STATES -- DON'T TAXES. TWENTY TWO THAT'S AN AREA WHERE I WOULDN'T WANT TO JOIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAXING OUR SENIORS AS THEIR TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET -- BUT FOR THE MOST PART AGAIN I THINK IT'S POSITIVE THING. AND AGAIN ISSUE STRUCK ME THE CONSTERNATION AND THE RULING IN ONLINE AND ALL THIS IS A TOUGH VOTE THIS AND THAT THE NEXT THING -- JUST SEEMS A LITTLE INSINCERE -- I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING IT HERE TODAY. AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO SO AS WELL AND I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK. THANK YOU KNOW I WAS HONORED TEN AGAIN KERRY THAT THE CONFORMITY BILL YOU MENTIONED TWENTY FIFTEEN I KERRY WHEN I WAS. THE PREVIOUS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE DECIDED TO MAKE THIS A A BILL WHICH ARE ARE ARE CHAIR WOMAN IS CARING. BECAUSE THAT YEAR THERE REALLY WASN'T MUCH. CONSTERNATION AND THERE REALLY WASN'T -- ANY CONTROVERSY ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR BAILEY WAS JUST STRAIGHT. STREAMLINING OF THE TAX PAYING PROCESS WHICH I THINK OVERALL MOST PEOPLE WERE IN FAVOR OF SERVICE AGAIN I THINK. WE APPRECIATE THE MINISTRATIONS ON THAT DISCUSSION TO THIS POINT AND TO REALLY TURN OVER INTO A LEGISLATIVE BILL BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE ULTIMATELY. WE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE COMFORTABLE TO LET IT GO THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS SO THAT WE COULD. YOU KNOW REALLY HAVE A OF FULLER VETTING OF THAT OF THAT THIS BILL. IT WILL FOLLOW UP QUESTION MISTER TING AND THE IMPETUS TO THE AUTHOR AS WELL IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE LANDING SPOT BUT WILL THIS BE THE ULTIMATE VEHICLE SENT DOWN TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. SO. SO. THERE IS A A MIRROR OF THIS BILL BEING VOTED ON I THINK. THAT THEY ARE PREPARING TO VOTE -- FOR IT'S ELIGIBLE AT FOUR FIFTEEN TODAY SO IT IS THE SAME BILL IT JUST HAS A DIFFERENT NUMBER IT'S AB -- NINETY ONE SO YES THE POLICY AND THAT BILL IS THE SAME AS THIS POLICY BUT WILL THIS BE THEN WILL THIS NUMBER BE THE NUMBER OF BILL THAT WE VOTE ON FOR WE DON'T KNOW YET. WE DON'T KNOW YET. I DON'T KNOW YET. LISTEN I JUST WORK HERE. NO MINUTE ALL SINCERELY IN ALL SINCERITY THERE ARE TWO BILLS THAT LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME -- ONE THAT WILL BE ON THE FLOOR IN THE SENATE MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WILL BE ON THE FLOOR AND THE SENATE TODAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THEN I'LL TAKE IT FOR YOUR COMMENTS -- TO THE VERY DIRECTLY THAT THE POLICY WERE VOTING ON IS WHAT WILL LAND ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THAT'S INTENTIONALLY TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY WON'T SPEAK FOR OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE RED CARPET THAT IS THE INTENTION OF OF US THE OTHER ARAB THE ASSEMBLY THE TENSION LANCASTER. THE AND THEN JUST TO CLARIFY ABEEN AB NINETY ONCE A BUDGET TRAILER BILL. SO THE SENATE FELL COMFORTABLE PUTTING THIS IN THE BUDGET FOR THE BALL OUR OUR HOUSE PREFERRED IT TO BE. IN OUR REGULAR ASSEMBLY BILL THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS [inaudible] DOCTOR PARK [inaudible] VERY INTERESTING. EVERY DAY IS A NEW ADVENTURE YEAH -- SO YES I UNDERSTAND. THE CONCERN -- FROM A NUMBER OF AGENCIES ABOUT THE I TEN AGAIN. WE WANTED TO GO UP -- TO THIRTY THOUSAND IN TERMS OF WHO COULD GET THE E. I. T. C.. AND IF WE DO THAT THEN THERE'S THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THE I TEN SO IT WAS. ONE OF THE OTHER SO. WE'RE WE'RE DOING. THE EXPANSION UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND AND PERHAPS NEXT YEAR WE CAN LOOK FURTHER -- NFIB NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES -- MR CABBAGE CHECK -- I DON'T HAVE A LETTER HERE SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT PROVISION YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE FOR THIS YEAR I WILL BE GLAD TO TALK TO MY CO AUTHORS BUT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE LATE RIGHT NOW -- I DO HAVE THE CONCERN. IN LISTENING TO THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS THAT. THEY HAVE CONTRACTS OUT NOW THAT ARE GOING TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A CHANGE IN. IN THE ARE. CODE FOR CONTRACTS THEY'VE ALREADY WRITTEN AND THEY TOLD ME THE NUMBER THEY LOSE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. HUNDRED AND TWENTY I THINK -- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE IS TIME AND ABILITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT I WILL. CERTAINLY DISCUSS IT WITH -- THE CHAIR AND MISTER CHANG AND WE'LL SEE WHERE WE CAN GO. DO YOU HAVE -- COMMENTS CHAIR OR I'M HAPPY TO SHARE MY COMMENTS WHICH TO LIKE TO SHARES AND HAVE THE SHOWING -- UNFORTUNATELY. THE AUTOMATED I HAD NOT HEARD FROM THOSE FOLKS AND TOLD TODAY I GOT AMENDMENTS IN -- SO THAT'S THE FIRST I AM ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MY STAFF HAS HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THEM SO I UNDERSTAND THEY'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS FOR A MONTH BUT FOR THE LAST. TWO WEEKS THAT WE'VE BEEN MY OFFICE HAS BEEN INVOLVED WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS AND I WAS GIVEN I THINK IT WAS SEVENTY EIGHT PAGE. AMENDMENT OR DOCUMENT TODAY TO TRY TO MAKE CHANGES. OUR HOPE IN SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE FROM THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WERE OUR ATTEMPT TO FIND A GOOD LANDING SPACE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME RETROACTIVITY. I THINK I I UNDERSTAND THAT AND MY HOPE WOULD BE AT SOME POINT THAT WE COULD DEAL WITH THAT. HOWEVER WITH THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR OF THEM COMING TO THE TABLE AT LEAST FOR MINE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT IS A CHALLENGE BUT I AM OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ACTUALLY CAME IN TODAY WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND I PROBABLY WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM -- BUT DO YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT THIS -- LIKE KIND EXCHANGE QUESTION BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY GROUP THAT IS OPPOSED -- TO TO THIS -- SEEMS TO BE OF THE THE AUTO MAKERS -- AND I AM IN FAVOR AS A FORMER A TAX PREPARER THINK I'D PREPARE TAXES FOR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AS A FINANCIAL ADVISER. I LIKE CONFORMITY JUST AS A MATTER OF OF OF PUBLIC POLICY -- IT'S MUCH SIMPLER AT TO BE ABLE TO THE FILE READ THE FILE YOUR RETURN OF FACT I WAS THINKING WITH THIS CONVERSATION CAME UP OF LIKE ALL HIGH NEED TO GO AMEND MY CALIFORNIA RETURN FROM LAST YEAR BECAUSE I DIDN'T TAKE SOME DEDUCTIONS BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ELIGIBLE ON THE FEDERAL. RETURN WHEN I COULD HAVE TAKEN THEM ON THE STATE RETURN SO I MIGHT STILL GO DO THAT IF YOU GUYS -- LISTENING HAVEN'T DONE THAT THERE'S STILL. THERE'S A IT'S NOT -- TO IT'S NOT TOO LATE IN THE READ SO MANY PEOPLE. DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT THEY USUALLY PUT THE DEDUCTIONS IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ON THE FEDERAL RETURN AND THEN IT FLOWS THROUGH TO THAT TO THE STATE COMPUTER DOES THAT OFTENTIMES AND THEN IT'S IT'S DONE -- BUT THIS IS GENERATING -- SO THIS IS ONE POINT SIX BILLION IN IN REVENUE BECAUSE WE ARE CONFORMING TO MANY PIECES OF THE FEDERAL TAX CODE BUT NOT ALL OF THEM -- THE ONE CONCERN THAT THE AUTOMAKERS HAD BROUGHT UP IN REGARDS TO LIKE KIND EXCHANGES -- IS THIS THAT ON THE FEDERAL SIDE -- THE PROVISIONS CHANGE BUT THEN THEYALSO ENDED UP WITH A BOB WITH BONUS DEPRECIATION -- YET WE'RE NOT DOING THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA NINE I KNOW THAT -- FACT I'M LOOKING AT THIS NUMBER I'M I'M SURE I GOT THIS AT THIS IS MY STAFF FOR THE FATHERS WERE LOOKING AT THIS BUT THERE IS ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR IN REVENUE IT'S GONNA. DECLINE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF OF YEARS BUT THIS ISN'T REVENUE NEUTRAL -- THE EITC EXPANSION IS SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND EXISTING E. I. T. C. IS ALREADY -- FOUR HUNDRED MILLION AND SO THERE'S AN EXTRA SIX HUNDRED MILLION -- OUT THERE AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE KIND ON THE LIKE KIND EXCHANGE AT LEAST THE IMPACT IT WOULD BE SOME AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION. SO I WOULD THINK EVEN THOUGH. TO OUR THIRTY EIGHT MILLION AS WHAT I HAVE IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. TO BE ABLE TO TO FIGURE THIS OUT IS THERE ANY ROOM AT ALL FOR NEGOTIATIONS. WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS I KNOW WE GET THIS OUT OF OUR COMMITTEE WE CAN'T AMEND IT -- ON THE FLOOR I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME OTHER BUT TIME CONSTRAINTS IT THERE BUT IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO BE ABLE TO TO GET EVERYBODY THAT TO BE ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY ON THIS -- OF THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE CAN IT CAN WORK OUT AS OR ANY TIME FOR THAT. SO I'LL SPEAK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION -- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK THE KEY THING HERE IS THAT THE BUDGET I KNOW PASSED OFF THE FLOOR LAST WEEK. AND THIS PACKAGE -- WITH ITS REVENUES AS WELL AS THE EITC IS PRETTY ESSENTIAL TO THE OVERALL BUDGET PACKAGE -- AND IN FACT THE BUDGET THAT WAS ADOPTED ASSUME THE REVENUES THAT WERE IN THIS PACKAGE SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL. TO GET THESE REVENUES -- BEFORE THE GOVERNOR CAN ACTUALLY SIGNED THE BUDGET ON WITH REGARD TO THE SPECIFICS OF THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION -- BEING LARGER THAN THE ONE BILLION OF THE EITC A COUPLE OF BRIEF POINTS FIRST I THINK AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED -- THAT ONE POINT SIX BILLION IS HIGH IN THE FIRST YEAR BECAUSE IT OF A QUIRK OF TIGHTENING AND OVER TIME IT ACTUALLY DECLINES TO ONE POINT THREE BILLION SO THAT THE CREDIT. AND THE REVENUE ARE MUCH MORE ALIGNED AND THAT WAS ALWAYS THE PURPOSE IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING THIS TALK INFORMALLY PACKAGE IN pBENEFITS THAT WE DISCUSSED. I THINK THE SECOND THING IS THAT THESE REVENUES ARE UNCERTAIN BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WERE ADOPTING MANY OF THESE PROVISIONS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED IN JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. SO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION ARE WORKING TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THESE ESTIMATES AND WE NAY OVERSHOOT WE MAY UNDER SHOOT IN TERMS OF ONE THE MONEY ACTUALLY COMES AND BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE CONSERVATIVE IN THOSE ESTIMATES BECAUSE IF THE REVENUE. DOES COME IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED -- THAT COULD LEAVE A BIG HOLE IN THE BUDGETS WE WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A BUFFER THERE AND THEN THE FINAL THING IS IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET AGREEMENT ITSELF -- THESE REVENUES AS MENTIONED ARE PART OF THE BUDGET AGREEMENT SO WHEN IT COMES TO OUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT LEVEL WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE OTHER ONGOING PROGRAMS THAT WERE INCREASED. AS PART OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. ON THOSE ARE ALREADY TAKING AND THESE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE PART OF THIS BILL -- SO WE DO THINK AT THIS POINT IT WOULD BE HARD TO UNWIND -- ELEMENTS OF THE BILL. I HAVE A QUESTION ON THAT IT MEDICARE I DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE BUT THAT'S FINE. IS ON THAT SITE ON IT. DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE AS TO IF WE DON'T WITH THE ACTUAL RETROACTIVITY PORTION HOW MUCH THAT WOULD COST. SO I I WILL MAKE ONE COMMENT ABOUT THAT AND THEN I MAY DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES A CHAMBER ONE AS WELL WHO'S WITH ME FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS PROVISION -- IS RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR IS THAT CORRECT. ACTUALLY TO JANUARY TENTH OF THIS YEAR THAT'S RIGHT JANUARY TENTH OF THIS YEAR AND THE REASON WE CHOSE THAT DATE IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS PUT OUT -- JANUARY NINTH I BELIEVE ACTUALLY AND SO WHILE THIS BILL MAY NOT BE PASSED UNTIL NEXT WEEK OR OR WHATEVER THE PASSAGE STATE IS -- WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE GOVERNOR PUT ITS BUDGET OUT -- EVERYONE WAS ON NOTICE THAT THESE PROVISIONS COULD BE IN THE LAWS SO WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS REALLY NO NEED OF SURPRISE HERE WITH REGARD TO THESE PROVISIONS. I THINK I WOULD AGREE TO DISAGREE BUT SO eYOU AMOUNT FROM THE APARTMENT OF FINANCE OF WHAT THE COST OF RETRO OF REMOVING THE RIGHT I JUST SO THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER. OF THE RETROACTIVITY WOULD COST WHAT IT WOULD COST TO TAKE I DO NOT HAVE NOTS IN FACT I'M NOT. REALLY CLEAR WHAT THAT PROPOSAL WOULD BE OKAY ALL RIGHT THINKING BUT YEAH. AND IT ACTUALLY A MINUTE ON CHANGE GEARS HERE FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT ACTUALLY IT WAS A LITTLE FASCINATED -- TO HEAR ABOUT THIS YOUNG CHILD -- BUT TAX CREDIT -- SO THAT AS A REFUNDABLE CREDIT AS WELL RIGHT SO THAT'S UP -- FOR BUT BUT SO. BECAUSE IT'S NEW AND HAVEN'T HAD A WHOLE TIME THE TO DIG INTO IT CAN I DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY GIVE A GIVE A BRIEF ON THAT OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK. AND THEN PART OF THAT TOO IS DOES IT START ON THE FIRST DOLLAR OF MADE OF GOT A BRIEF HERE FROM THE CAL BUDGET CENTER. AND IT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FROM WHAT I CAN TELL I DON'T HAVE THE COLOR CODING PROPER -- BUT DOES THAT START ON THE FIRST DOLLARS OF SOMEBODY MAKES A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN FILES I DO THEY GET A THOUSAND ARE TAX CREDIT OR DOES THAT. BEGIN TO SCALE UP LIKE THE REST OF THE HTC. SURE SO MAKE TWO COMMENTS ON THAT I THINK FIRST IS ONE THING THAT WE REALIZED IN SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THE EITC. IS IT IS IT CAN BE A VERY COMPLICATED PROPOSAL SO WHEN YOU WALK UP TO SOMEONE ON THE STREET AND SAY HEY THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. OFTENTIMES PEOPLE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING AND THEN THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO CLAIM THE BENEFIT SO WHAT WE REALIZED WITH THIS BILL THIS PROPOSAL IS IN ADDITION TO GENERALLY. STRENGTHENING THE CREDIT MAKING IT MORE GENEROUS AND AS MR TING MENTIONED EXTENDING IT TO PEOPLE WHO MAKE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS. IF THE MINIMUM WAGE WERE FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR ABOUT THE INCOME THAT YOU WOULD MAKE FOR A FORTY HOUR A WEEK FULL TIME JOB. FOR A YEAR WE ALSO WANT TO SAY IF YOU HAVE A YOUNG CHILD OR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX GIVEN THE PREVALENCE OF CHILD POVERTY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S A GOAL FOR THE GOVERNOR AND FOR I KNOW FOR SO MANY OF YOU. TO REDUCE CHILD POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA ON TOP OF THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MONEY TO SUPPORT YOU AS YOU RAISE YOUR KIDS AND IN OUR JANUARY PROPOSAL IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. A THROUGH THE NAY REVISION AS WE REFINED A REVENUE ESTIMATES AND SOME OF THE WAYS WE WERE DISCUSSING INCREASED IT TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS SO BASICALLY THE MESSAGE THAT. WE WANT TO CONVEY IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH MR TANG IN THE REST OF THE LEGISLATURE IS IS IN ADDITION TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT GENERALLY WHICH WERE MAKING WORK -- GENEROUS A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE IF YOU MAKE UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE HAVE A CHILD UNDER SIX AND YOU WORK THEN YOU GET AN EXTRA THOUSAND DOLLARS SO BUT IF YOU MAKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS OF INCOME DO YOU STILL GET A THOUSAND DOLLAR. CHECK FOR EVERY AND THEN IS IT LIMITED TO THE NUMBER OF THIS -- ANY CHILD AND THE AGE OF AGE OF SIX OF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU'LL GET A CHECK FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S CORRECT IF YOU WORK IF YOU'RE ASK SOMEONE WHO WORKS AND EARNS ANY TYPE OF WAGE FOR THAT YEAR YOU WOULD AND SEATS ON THE FIRST DOLLARS SO IF YOU MAKE FIFTY BUCKS -- YOU WILL GET A CHECK FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PAY NOTE STATE TAXES YOU'LL GET A CHECK FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S CORRECT. THANK YOU MANAGER. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. I'M OKAY SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION WE'RE GONNA GENERATE IN THE FIRST YEAR. SO THE BULK OF THIS IS FROM INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS OWNERS CORRECT THROUGH THE LIMITS ON NON CORPORATE BUSINESS LOSSES IS THAT. CORRECT THAT IS THE LARGEST REVENUE RAISER OKAY SO THAT'S A BIG CHUNK OF IT. SO I THINK. THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE WANT TO EXPAND IDC AND THAT IT'S A GOOD PROGRAM I THINK. MY CONCERN IS THE PROFILE OF THE TAX PAYERS THAN THAT ARE GOING TO BE FUNDING US AND I'D LOVE YOU TO HELP ME. UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE A CONCERN THAT. A LOT OF THESE FOLKS AREN'T YOU KNOW CAN A NAMELESS BILLIONAIRES AND AND YOU KNOW. FACELESS CORPORATIONS MY CONCERN IS THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE THE SAME FOLKS THAT WERE ACTUALLY HAD. QUITE ADVERSELY BY THE TRUMP TAX CHANGES. AND THAT THEY WEREN'T THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOYED A WINDFALL -- AND THAT THIS WILL IN FACT BE KIND OF A DOUBLE THE DOUBLE KNOCK FOR THEM SO CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND. THAT LION SHARE THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS CENTERS THAT ARE GONNA BE. PAYING THE LION'S SHARE OF THIS INCREMENTAL REVENUE WHAT'S THE PROFILE OF THOSE FOLKS. YES WE CAN ADD A COUPLE FACTS -- THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT PERSON LOOKS LIKE I THINK THE FIRST THING TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT. THE ACCESS BUSINESS LOSSES ARE ONLY FOR LOSSES IN EXCESS OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S FOR A MARRIED COUPLE SO ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS THAT IF YOU IF YOU'RE AND YOUR SPOUSE. MAKE LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A GIVEN YEAR THAN THIS BILL WILL NOT AFFECT YOU IN THAT YEAR YOU WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO DEDUCT -- ANY BUSINESS LOSSES AN OFFSET THAT OTHER INCOME -- WITH REGARD TO THE PEOPLE WHO DO MAKE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A GIVEN YEAR -- WE'VE LOOKED AT THE DATA AND THE BEST OUT OF THAT WE HAVE I THINK FROM THE YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN SHOWS THAT THIS PROVISION WOULD AFFECT SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF AND THAT THE AVERAGE INCOME OF THESE TAXPAYERS IS THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. ANY OTHER WEIGHT WHEN COULD LOVE DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE LIKE A A CHART THAT WE CAN SEE THAT DOES SO THE AVERAGE IS ONE THING BUT YOU KNOW ONE PERSON EARNING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OBVIOUSLY LIKES USE THAT A LOT. DO YOU HAVE THAT DISTRIBUTION IS THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE. WE DO NOT -- I HAVE NOT ASKED FOR THAT IT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO GET THAT I'M NOT SURE. OKAY THANKS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I HAVE. ONE SO -- TO MR MAYES POINT MY QUESTION IS SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE I. T. C. AND WHAT THE CHILD CREDIT YOUR PRIMARILY STE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO TRADITIONALLY DON'T ACTUALLY WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE A PILOT TAX RETURN. SO THAT THEN THEY GET THE CREDIT SO IN YOUR OPINION HOW OFTEN WOULD YOU FIND SOMEBODY WHO MAKES A HUNDRED DOLLARS WHO IS GOING TO FILE FOR THE TAX CREDIT FOR THE CREDIT FOR THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. BECAUSE YOU MUST HAVE CALCULATED SOME ERROR OR SOME PORTION FOR THAT. YES A FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE TO GET PEOPLE TO FILE FOR THE CREDIT SO I THINK WE'RE ATTACKING THAT ISSUE IN TWO WAYS ONE IS BY MAKING THE MESSAGE MUCH SIMPLER -- IT'S EASIER TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT THERE -- AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS ACTUALLY INCREASING OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS SO THE BUDGET AGREEMENT ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST WEEK INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR REGION. ACTUALLY THE ADMINISTRATION HAD FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS THROUGH THE CONFERENCE PROCESS THAT AMOUNT WAS DOUBLE TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS SO IT IS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THRESHOLD FOR FILING. STATE TAXES IS DIFFERENT FROM FEDERAL BUT WE'RE HOPING BUT THAT MUCH SIMPLER MESSAGE IF YOU HAVE A KID UNDER SIX YOU CAN GET A THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOU MAKE LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND WITH ACTUAL MONEY TO MATCH THE EFFORTS ON THE GROUND INCLUDING MANY OF THE FOLKS HERE CORRUGATION CANADIAN FOR TO GET THE WORD OUT WE THINK WE COULD REACH A LOT OF THAT POPULATION. SO THEORETICALLY TRADITIONALLY SOMEONE WHO MADE UNDER A THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THEM FILE AT ALL SO THAT. THE REALLY THE CHANCES SOMEONE WHO MAKES A HUNDRED DOLLARS WOULD NOT BE REALLY FILING FOR THIS TO GET THEIR THOUSAND DOLLARS. CORRECT YES THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA FIRE OKAY COMING. MET MADAM CHAIR IF I IF I CAN ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE I SHOULD SHARE THE STORY SO ACTUALLY WILL -- WHEN I DID PREPARE TAXES THIS WAS -- IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS ONE MY FIRST YEARS -- MEMBER SOMEBODY SITTING IN FRONT OF ME I'M ALSO THE STORY THE IN BUDGET BUT I WASN'T COMPLETE SO TELL THE COMPLETE STORY. I STILL REMEMBER SITTING DOWN AND THERE'S THIS -- INDIVIDUAL THAT CAME AND SAT BEFORE ME SHE SAID I'M A HAIRDRESSER. AS A GREAT LAW SHOW ME YOUR INITIATIVE FROM YOUR YOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SO SHE SO I GOT IT WRITTEN DOWN A SAID OKAY GREAT SO SHE WON'T CAñADA MEANS THAT SHE'S. FRONT OF ME AND I SAID OKAY WELL WHAT'S YOUR INCOME SHE SAID WHAT EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND SO I SAID OH EIGHT EIGHT THOUSAND ARE THAT'S GREAT WHAT YOUR EXPENSES WELL YOU KNOW I WORK FROM MY HOUSE AND YOU KNOW I BY BY SOME BY SOME SCISSORS AND AND AND BUT YOU KNOW A REALLY REALLY LOW AND JUST WHAT'S WHAT'S MY REFUND. WHAT'S YOUR REFUND SO COURSE CONTROL TAB. POPS UP AND SAYS -- IT'S FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WHATEVER THAT THE NUMBER IS SHE SAID YOU KNOW ACTUALLY I'M I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE I I I THINK MAYBE IT WAS -- TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MAYBE IS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHAT'S. A SAID OKAY SO IS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR PUT IN TEN THOUSAND SHE CONTROL TAB IN. AND THEN NOW SHE'S GETTING A REFUND OF NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SHE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A SWEET SPOT IN WHICH HER SELF EMPLOYMENT TAXES USE BUSES PAY ON THE FEDERAL AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. WAS OVER AND ABOVE THAT SO THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE SMART THEY ARE FOR THEIR FOLKS WHO WILL COME IN AND WILL. GAME THE SYSTEM ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD WHEN WE FIRST IMPLEMENTED THE COW AND I AM A SUPPORTER. OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD WAS WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO A TO INCLUDE ALL FILERS OR IF IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE FOR EMPLOYEES. HE YOU'LL RECEIVE A W. TWO WHEN YOU GET THAT W. TO YOU ENTER THAT W. -- TO INTO THE RETURN AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE THAT'S HOLDING YOU ACCOUNTABLE AS SOON AS YOU APPLY THIS TO ALL FILERS WHICH I THINK IS WHERE WERE. WE ARE CURRENTLY AT SO IF YOU OWN YOUR OWN BUSINESS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TO GET THIS SO SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY INCOME CAN CLAIM INCOME NOW HERE'S THE ONE THING. THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT -- THE UNDER FEDERAL LAW IT IS -- THAT YOU HAVE TO CLEAN ALL OF YOUR INCOME. BUT IF YOU CLAIM MORE THAN YOUR YOUR INCOME HOW DO YOU PROVE -- THAT THAT SOMEBODY DIDN'T MAKE IT THAT INCOME SO HOW TO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T ANY. ANY FRAUD OR HOW DO WE AT LEAST LIMIT  WHEN WE'RE TALKING BUT I GUESS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT FIRST THAT FIRST DOLLAR. YOU KNOW I'M I'M GONNA ASK FTV SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. FTV. ALL MAY TWO BRIEF COMMENTS MAYBE TAKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND THEN EFFECTIVELY. TO WITHDRAW MANAGER I'M NOT SURE GONNA BILL ANSYS TODAY IT'S FINE IF YOU GUYS GET BACK TO ME IS JUST A CONCERN BUT I I WISH I COULD NOT THINK OF THE BEACON PROBABLY ADDRESS. THOSE CONCERNS. YES SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN IDENTIFYING THE TRADE OFF THERE'S ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN -- BUT ALSO GUARDING AGAINST ANY POSSIBILITY OF FRAUD WHEN IT COMES TO THE ITEMS IN THIS SPECIFIC BILL I THINK THERE ARE -- TWO PLACES WHERE IT'S LESS OF A CONCERN THAN IT OTHERWISE MIGHT BE THE FIRST IS THE FACT AS YOU POINTED OUT AT SOMEONE I'M AMAZED AT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A THOUSAND DOLLAR FRANK. WHAT CREDIT MEANS THAT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY VERY WITH INCOME -- SO THE TYPE OF GAMESMANSHIP THAT YOU WERE REFERRING -- TO WOULDN'T HAPPEN SPECIFICALLY WITH THE THOUSAND DOLLAR YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT AND THEN I THINK THE SECOND THING AND THIS IS -- JUST A MATTER OF DEGREE -- BUT ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS -- DALE ETS AND THIS KIND OF GOES TO WHAT YOU WERE DISCUSSING IN THE CURRENT STATE -- EITC IT'S MUCH MORE GENEROUS -- FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE BETWEEN A DOLLAR AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT IT IS FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE REALLY MAKING -- THE LOWEST INCOME IN CALIFORNIA BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID IN THIS BILL -- THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS INCREASED BENEFITS AS WELL FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ALSO EXTENDING IT OUT TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THAT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE FLATTENED GENEROUS IN THOSE AREAS AND SO REDUCES SOME OF THE INCENTIVES THAT YOU WERE DISCUSSING. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. I'M. I'M SORRY MY FIRST TIME HERE THAT'S OKAY JUST PULL THE MIKE UP CLOSE TO YOU AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT MR MEANS HE HE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY I'M THE SIMILAR MEMBER IS RIGHT THERE ARE SOME I THINK THE TERM PEOPLEHAVE USED ARE BAD ACTORS -- YOU KNOW WHO WOULD TRY TO FIND THE SWEET SPOT OF THE EXACT NUMBER OF CREDIT -- THE DEPARTMENT HAS TRIED -- TO USE SOPHISTICATED -- REVENUE ANALYTICS AND PREDICTIVE MODELS -- SO THAT WE ARE GETTING BETTER AT IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW -- CLAIMS THAT WOULD WE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE IMPROPER -- AND IF WE IDENTIFY A CLAIM THAT'S AT THE SWEET SPOT YOU KNOW MAYBE THREE CHILDREN THE EXACT NUMBER OF INCOME TO GET THE EXACT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR MAXIMUM CREDIT -- THEN WE DO TRY TO SEND OUT A CORRESPONDENCE TO THE TAXPAYER AND ASK FOR VERIFICATION -- MAYBE THE TAXPAYERS CLAIMING THREE CHILDREN WE IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM A PRIOR YEAR WE MIGHT ASK FOR BIRTH CERTIFICATES ARE DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT WE DO TRY TO WORK WITH -- THE TAXPAYER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CORRECT INDIVIDUAL IS GETTING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY. ON MAKE ONE OTHER POINT -- ON THE SIMILAR TOPICS THE THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT IT DOES APPLY WITH THE FIRST DOLLAR OF INCOME BUT IT DOES FACE OUT SO WE'RE NOT IN A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU MAKE. THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE OF A CHILD UNDER SIX YOU GET A THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT BUT IF YOU MAKE A DOLLAR BEYOND THAT YOU LOSE THE WHOLE CREDIT THERE IS A BUILT IN FACE DOWN MECHANISM FOR THAT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE I'M GOING TO I JUST FIRST I THINK MR TING FOR PRESENTING FOR ME YOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB I WANT TO THINK THE CO AUTHORS FOR AB -- TWO SEVENTEEN THOSE THAT HAVE COME IN TESTIFIED TODAY EVEN SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT TRADITIONALLY AREN'T OF SOME OF OUR POVERTY PARTNERS AND WHO HAVE BECOME POVERTY PARTNERS LIKE THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE REALLY APPRECIATIVE AND THANKFUL FOR THE REPORT YOU'VE DONE. TO ALSO VERIFY THAT THE I. T. C. IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THAT THIS WE ACTUALLY THAT THIS IS PRETTY GOOD BILL YOU'VE RARELY DO WE COME UP WITH TWO PEOPLE ON A BILL THAT THAT OF THIS MAGNITUDE THAT. THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THERE IS SOME MIDDLE GROUND TO BE FOUND THERE. HOWEVER -- I DO WANT TO SAY THIS THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN LIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN DEEP CHILD POVERTY THAT MEANS THAT THEY LIVE A FAMILY OF FOUR UNDER THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. TO ME IF THERE IS A 2% OF THOSE PEOPLE. WHO ACTUALLY TAKE THE CREDIT WHO DID NOT DESERVE IT I'M OKAY WITH THAT? I CAN ACTUALLY LIVE WITH THAT THOSE CHILDREN NEED THAT MONEY AND THOSE FAMILIES NEED THAT MONEY. AND BY THE WAY NOT ALL I'M SORRY THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE. PEOPLE WERE DISHONEST BUT THE REALITY IS IS THAT ALL POOR PEOPLE NOT DISHONEST. THERE WERE THESE ARE WORKING POOR WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND NEED THIS HELP AND THEY HAVE EARNED IT. AND SO I THINK PHIL FOR HIS OR OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR CONSTANT WORK ON THIS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS I APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME MY COMMENTARY ON THIS BILL -- AND WITH THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THINK THAT'S CLOSE. IF I WERE YOU CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BURKE. WORK I'D BRO. BROWN NOT VOTING CHU. CHU AYE GRAY. GRAY AYE MAYES. MAYES NOT VOTING MELINDA'S MULLIN [inaudible] MULLIN I PETRIE-NORRIS. PETRIE-NORRIS NOT VOTING QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE RIVAS. RIVAS I TING TING ON FIVE SIX SEVEN THE BILL IS OUT MOVING TO FILE ITEM TO SB THREE FORTY NINE A SENSE SENATOR PORTANTINO WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN SEE HERE YEAH -- YOU KNOW -- YOUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE GONE NOW. 714- WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR PEOPLE AS YOU'RE LEAVING THE ROOM IF WE COULD BE QUITE WE STILL HAVE BUSINESS ON THE FILE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SAID TODAY I AM PRESENTING AN EASY BILL. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION SB -- THREE FOUR NINE WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX ON SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES AS WE ALL KNOW ARE THE BACKBONE OF A CALIFORNIA'S GOING ECONOMY. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT OVER THREE MILLION OF CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES ACCOUNT FOR SIGNIFICANT -- NUMBER STATE EMPLOYEE PLAYERS AND 45% OF CALIFORNIA'S EXPORTS UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE'S AN ANNUAL MINIMUM MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX OF EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ON EVERY CORPORATION. THIS TAX IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL STRUCTURE THAT -- MANY SMALL BUSINESSES STRUGGLE TO AFFORD STIFLES GROWTH GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY AND SIR SB THREE FOUR NINE CREATES A FEE STRUCTURE BASED ON A CORPORATION'S ANNUAL GROSS RECEIPTS THIS WILL HELP FOSTER GROWTH OF A SMALL BUSINESS AND ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. AND I'D LIKE TO ALSO ADD THAT WE HAVE TAKEN THE AMENDMENTS ON THIS BILL TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHAIR AND REVENUE AND TAX CODE SECTION. FORTY ONE AND TO DEVELOP A FIVE YEAR SUNSET PROVISION AND I HAVE ROBIN BLACK. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS -- THAT MADAM CHAIR ROBIN BLACK -- I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT BILL FORWARD -- WE'VE TRIED FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO COME TO THIS BODY AND ASK FOR A REDUCTION IN THAT MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX. AND IT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY TO A LOT OF FOLKS -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU JUST HAD ON THE OTHER VALLEY KIND OF EVEN FEEL GUILTY SITTING HERE. BUT IT IS IT IS A BIG DEAL TO SMALL BUSINESSES MANY SMALL BUSINESS ARE WOMEN IN MY ORDER MINORITY OWNED. MANY OF THEM DON'T MAKE A PROFIT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND MANY OF THEM ARE STRUGGLING -- TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESS GOING AND TRY TO EMPLOY PEOPLE -- IN SHOW OF YOUR ANALYSIS MAKES A POINT THAT I WANTED TO JUST REFERENCE VERY QUICKLY -- VERY WISELY MAKES A POINT AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT REALLY IS AT THE HEART OF THIS SPELL -- WHEN YOU DO CONSIDER FOR A LOT OF FOLKS WHEN THEY'RE NOT MAKING? MONEY ON THEIR SMALL BUSINESS THAT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS IS REALLY A BARRIER AND SO WHAT IT FORCES THEM TO DO IN MANY CASES IS JUST BE GOD CREATED A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP AS URINALYSIS REFERS. TO IF YOU DO CREATE AS A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR. MINIMUM TAX THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT YOU DON'T ENJOY ANY THE PROTECTIONS OF BEING A CORPORATION. AND YOU ARE PERSONALLY LIABLE -- FOR THAT SMALL BUSINESS AS A SOLE PROPRIETOR WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE -- SMALL BUSINESSES ACTUALLY INCORPORATE AND BY MAKING IT MORE AFFORDABLE TO DO SO WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU'LL HAVE A LOT MORE SMALL BUSINESSES -- COME INTO FULL CORPORATION PROTECTIONS AND BE PAYING INSTEAD OF JUST 17% PAYING. EIGHT HUNDRED YOU MAY HAVE. 80% PAYING TWO FOUR SIX EIGHT HUNDRED SELL -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE'D LIKE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU TO SNOW IN ASSISTANCE SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER TARA HILL WITH ERIN READING ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ENROLLED AGENTS. IN SUPPORT AND THE SPONSOR MENTIONED COME IT INCREASES COMPLIANCE WHEN YOU MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT SMOOTHER SO WE WERE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE OF PRODUCING THAT. THANK THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE -- COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL ANALYSIS I DO BILLS JUST SO I CAN SEE MISTER RUFF AND YOUR COMMITTEE WHO I HAVE A LONG SWEET SPOT. FOR AND SO THAT'S WHAT HITS ALL HIS FAULT THAT I'M BACK IN THIS CASE. LISTEN YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON TO GIVE HIM PROPS. TO AND WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR A VOTE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND HOPE TO SEE YU ALL AT SMALL BUSINESS DAY WHICH IS WEDNESDAY RIGHT NEXT WEDNESDAY ONCE FANTASTIC THANK YOU. THIS WEDNESDAY JUST. ONE THANK YOU KNOW ABOUT RIGHT. THE SILENCE FOR TESTIMONY ONLY THANKS. CENTERS DONE. FIVE MILLION FILE ITEM THREE SB THREE SIXTY FOUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT SB THREE SIXTY FOUR THE PROBLEM IS CURRENTLY PLAGUING CALIFORNIA'S OR AMOUNT OF VETERANS WHO ARE HOMELESS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX HOMELESS VETERANS EQUITY TO ALMOST 30% OF THE NATION'S TOTAL HOMELESS VETERAN POPULATION. VETERANS OF SACRIFICE SO MUCH FOR OUR COUNTRY AND LOCAL IN RETURN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS THE TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO HELP THEM SUCCEED. THERE'S NO SINGLE SOLUTION IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS REASONS FOR THE LARGE NUMBERS OF HOMELESS VETERANS ARE NUMEROUS AND COMPLEX. TWO OF THE BIGGEST FACTORS THOUGH ARE THE EXTREME SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LIVABLE INCOME. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR CAMPS ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS OF VETERANS FACED BY DOING THE FOLLOWING. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR FREEZES THE ANNUAL PROPERTY TAX INFLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR ALL HONORABLY DISCHARGED VETERANS WHO ARE SIXTY FIVE YEARS OR OLDER. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES BASIC STEP IN HELPING OUR VETERAN COMMUNITY. BY EXPANDING THE CURRENT PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION IN THE CURRENT REACH A LAW CALIFORNIA IS HONORING THE SACRIFICES OF OUR VETERANS. AND PROVIDING THEM A WAY TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES SB THREE SIXTY FOUR IS PASSED OFF THE SENATE FLOOR. AND OUT OF THE SENATE COMMITTEES UNANIMOUSLY OF THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. THANK YOU I WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION? QUITE TIME THAT APPROACH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BURKE GANDAK COMMITTEE MEMBERS AGAIN MY NAME IS JESSE SALINAS FROM THE YOLO COUNTY ASSESSOR. RECORDED REGISTER VOTERS BUT I'M HERE AS THE A COUNTY ASSESSOR AND REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SISTERS ASSOCIATION. SO -- FIRST ALLOW ME AYE WE'RE HERE IN OPPOSITION OF SB THREE SIXTY FOUR AND ALLOW ME TO FOR SURE THAT. THAT THE DISABLED AND EIGHT AND A AGING VETERANS HAVE THE SUPPORT AND RESPECT TO THE CALIFORNIA SISTERS. HOWEVER THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF SB THREE SIXTY FOUR IS PROBLEMATIC. AS OUTLINED THE LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE US TO MONITOR ALL PROPERTIES OWNED BY VETERANS AND TRACK THEIR ANNUAL INCOME AND H.. STARTING IN. TWENTY TWENTY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THE SENSORS WILL NEED TO DO THE FOLLOWING NUMBER ONE CREATE NEW REPORTING REFORMS AND RECORDS KEEPING STANDARDS. THAT IS THE UNIQUE TO THIS POPULATION AND REQUESTS PERSONAL DATA. SAID PROPERTY OWNERS FRANKLY ARE NOT ALWAYS EAGER TO SHARE. SECONDLY THERE ISN'T A NEED TO UPDATE OUR COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE KNOW DOING ANYTHING STATEWIDE RELATED TO COMPUTERS CAN BE A CHAT. CURRENTLY THERE ARE THIRTY ONE COUNTIES USING THE SAME PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM THE REMAINING TWENTY SEVEN COUNTIES HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUALIZED SYSTEMS. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEMS AND THE INTERPLAY OF SUCH INFORMATION WITH THE OVERALL CLOSING OF THE ROLE. ASKING TO COMPLETE THIS TYPE OF CHANGE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME LINE IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. AND IS LIKELY TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT GIVEN THE BROAD VARIATIONS OF SYSTEMS THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS A VARIOUS WORKAROUNDS WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED. LASTLY. IT WILL SET A PRECEDENT THAT COULD OPEN THE DOOR TO OTHER WILL INTENDED EFFORTS FOR OTHER RESPECTED GROUPS WANTING SIMILAR EXEMPTIONS. IF WE SAY YES TO THIS PROPOSAL WHO WILL BE THE NEXT GROUP KNOCKING ON THE DOOR ASKING FOR SUMMER EXEMPTIONS. WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA SUCH AS ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU HOLD THIS BILL -- TO FOR MEDITATE THANK YOU. THERE'S NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. JEFF NEAL REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES HERE RELUCTANTLY -- OPPOSING THE BILL FOR THE REASONS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY OF SUSPENDING THE INFLATION FACTORS NOT A WAY THAT WE DO THIS FOR ANY OTHER. ANY OTHER TAX EXEMPTION. ONE WHO -- EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. HAS BEEN I'M SURE THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION HAVING BEEN A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND THE FOURTH LARGEST COUNTY IN THIS. AND THE STATE AND THE TENTH LARGEST COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY I'M I'M WELL AWARE OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WHAT CAN'T BE DONE THE FREEDOM BY APPLICATION ONLY THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO GO AND PURGE ALL THE RECORDS SEE WHO THE VETERANS THAT ARE IN GOOD STANDING THE FALL. WITHIN CERTAIN INCOME CATEGORIES THEY HAVE TO FILE AN APPLICATION. THE THE FISCAL COST OF THE STATE OR TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A STATEWIDE AND IT'S GONNA IT WOULD AFFECT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S A VERY SMALL TOKEN OF APPRECIATION OF WE CONTROL THEM BY -- BY FREEZING THE PROPERTY TAXES LET THESE ELDERLY -- VETERANS -- HAVE ONE THING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM THAT'S THE ABILITY TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. AND THIS WOULD BE A GOOD STEP IN THAT DIRECTION OF THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THIS ITEM IS FOR A TEST MONNING ONLY TODAY THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR JONES.
