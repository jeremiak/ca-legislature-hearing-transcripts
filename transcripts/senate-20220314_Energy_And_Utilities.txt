STERN HERE SURE YOU HAVE A QUORUM. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM WHAT WILL GO TO OUR FIRST BILL ITEM NUMBER ONE OR THE BILL NUMBER SB EIGHT THREE THREE BY SENATOR DODD THE COMMUNITY ENERGY RESILIENCY ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND FOLLOWING HIS PRESENTATION WILL HAVE SPEAKERS. JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA FOLLOWED BY KIRK JOHNSON FROM THE CLIMATE CENTER AND THEY DO- JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THEY'RE QUEUED UP READY TO GO FOLLOWING HIS PRESENTATION SENATOR DODD WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN A GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AS WELL- I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST KNOW THAT I'LL BE TAKING THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. S. B. EIGHT THREE THREE CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF A NEW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. TO PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE RESOURCES TO DEVELOP CLEAN ENERGY RESILIENCE PLANTS WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH UTILITIES AND PRIORITIZING ENHANCE RESILIENCE FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE INCREASING FREQUENCY OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND THE UTILITIES USE A PROACTIVE POWER SHUT OFFS IMPOSE ENORMOUS COSTS IN CALIFORNIA IT PROMPTED MANY HOMEOWNERS BUSINESSES AND UTILITIES. TO PURCHASE HIGHLY POLLUTING BACKUP GENERATORS. THERE IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE THAT ENHANCES ENERGY RESILIENCE USING DECENTRALIZED LOCALLY PRODUCED CLEAN ENERGY I'M LIKE DIESEL GENERATORS THAT MIGHT ONLY BE USED A FEW DAYS A YEAR DISTRIBUTED CLEAN ENERGY CAN BE USED ON A DAILY BASIS INCLUDING TO LOAD SHIFT EXCESS SOLAR GENERATION FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY SO THE CONCERN OF THE EVENING. P. QUOTE. OUR STATE'S ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ENHANCE RESILIENCE THROUGH OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT THEY DO NOT CONTROL LOCAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE ROADS AND PARKING LOTS OF MUTE MUNICIPAL FACILITIES PLACES WHERE NEW DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. COULD STRATEGICALLY BE LOCATED. BECAUSE THE ENERGY RESILIENCE IS INHERENTLY LOCAL BUILDING A MORE RESILIENT SYSTEM WILL REQUIRE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH UTILITIES THE PLAN IN SIGHT DISTRIBUTED DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. THIS IS WHERE S. B. EIGHT THREE THREE FILLS THE CURRENT VOID IN STATE POLICY. IT PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH RESOURCES TO DETERMINE HOW AND WHERE TO SITE NEW ENERGY RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE IN COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL DISTRICT PUTIAN UTILITY RATHER THAN HAVING CRUCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT DECISIONS MEDIA PROCESS DISCONNECTED FROM LOCAL PRIORITIES AND NEEDS HE WOULD FOSTER COLLABORATION. AND STRATEGIC PLANNING. I'M JOINED HERE TODAY BY TWO WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT KURT JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY ENERGY RESILIENCE AT THE CLIMATE CENTER. IN JOHN KENNEDY ON BEHALF OF THE WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. OKAY WE'LL GO TO WE'LL BEGIN WITH JOHN KENNEDY MISTER KENNEDY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTESFOR YOUR PRESENTATION YOU CAN BEGIN NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JOHN KENNEDY I'M WITH RC RC AND I'M HERE TODAY TO PROBABLY SUPPORT SB EIGHT THIRTY THREE. ARE HERE TO REPRESENT THIRTY NINE WORLD COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THOSE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN HIT HARD BY WILDFIRES AND POWER OUTAGES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S CONTINUED INTEREST IN LOCAL ENERGY RESILIENCY AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE THE PROPOSAL SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE JUST A FEW MOMENTS TO WALK YOU THROUGH OUR WORLD AND WHY WE'RE SO INTERESTED IN S. B. EIGHT THIRTY THREE. AS I MENTIONED OUR COUNTIES HAVE BEEN HIT HARD BY PS PS AND I'M SORT OF THE LAST FEW YEARS- THEY LEFT MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT POWER FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT A TIME. LAST YEAR THERE WERE OVER SIX HUNDRED OUTAGES RELATED TO P. GENIES DEPLOYMENT OF ITS ENHANCED POWER LINE SAFETY SETTINGS PROGRAM THAT PROGRAM SHUTS OFF POWER ON TO SOMETHING COMES INTO CONTACT WITH THEM. MOST OF THOSE OUTAGES LASTED FOR EIGHT HOURS OR MORE AND WE'RE EXTREMELY DISRUPTIVE FOR RESIDENTS BUSINESSES ON THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY SERVICES. WHAT YOU NEED TO EXPANSION OF THE SETTINGS SYSTEM WIDE WE EXPECT TO SEE EVEN MORE DISRUPTIONS ACROSS THE STATE. BUT WE DON'T DISPUTE THE RISK AVOIDANCE ROLE THAT THESE THE PSS SYSTEMS PLAY WE JUST KNOW THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING SYSTEM. TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT THAT STUFF OUT. FURTHERMORE IT LAST. HAD SNOWS IN ARAPAHOE FOR SOME WEEKS. OF OUR MORE ROOM. NOW COMMUNITY. IT WAS THE STATE MOVED TO ELECTRIFY THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND OTHER THINGS. IT'S VITAL THAT WE ALSO IMPROVE ELECTRICAL RELIABILITY IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE A. THIRTY THREE WILL HELP US IMPROVE ENERGY RELIABILITY BY HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS. TO MEET OUR LOCAL NEEDS. WE APPRECIATE THAT SB EIGHT THIRTY THREE WILL PRIORITIZE THOSE COMMUNITIES IN GREATEST NEED AND AT GREATEST RISK. FOR THESE REASONS RC RC RESPECTFULLY URGES YOUR I KNOW TODAY. THANKS VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE TO. KIRK JOHNSON FROM THE CLIMATE CENTER YEP TWO MINUTES. VICE CHAIRMAN DOLLY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND KIRK JOHNSON WITH THE CLIMATE CENTER THE ORGANIZATION SPONSORING SB EIGHT THIRTY THREE I'M PLEASED TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE ON WHY THIS MEASURE IS SO CRITICAL. GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS SOME OF THE LEAST RELIABLE ELECTRICITY IN THE COUNTRY. AND THE CORE OF OUR CURRENT ENERGY RESILIENCE STRATEGY. IS DIESEL WE CAN DO BETTER. INSTEAD IMAGINE A DIFFERENT WORLD A WORLD WHERE EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE CLEAN ENERGY TO SAVE MONEY ENHANCE ENERGY RESILIENCE FOR CRITICAL FACILITIES. LIKE LA COUNTY SANTA BARBARA AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON. A WORLD WHERE LOCALLY DEVELOPED AND APPROVED COMMUNITY ENERGY RESILIENCE PLANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SO THAT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS AND STATE CLIMATE RESILIENCE FUNDS CAN BE QUICKLY PUT TO GOOD USE. A WORLD WHERE CLEAN ENERGY PROVIDERS CAN RAPIDLY PROCEED WITH PROJECT DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN HAVING TO NAVIGATE LOCAL POLITICS AND BUREAUCRACY. FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PROJECT. A WORLD WHERE CALIFORNIA'S DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH SUFFER THE MOST FROM AIR POLLUTION HAVE CLEAN RELIABLE LOCAL POWER BUILT FIRST. INSTEAD OF BEING THE LAST TO BENEFIT FROM THE CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION. A WORLD WHERE WE'RE NOT RUNNING FOSSIL FIRED PEAKER PLANTS EVERY EVENING TO MEET THE EVENING PEAK LOAD. INSTEAD WE'RE USING OUR CLEAN DISTRIBUTED ENERGY FLEET INCLUDING MILLION SOLAR ROOFS A MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS LOAD SHIFTING ASSETS STORING EXCESS SOLAR GENERATED DURING THE DAY. SHIFTING AND INTO THE EVENING WHEN WE NEED IT MOST. SB EIGHT THIRTY THREE IS A POLICY REFORM NEEDED TO HELP MAKE THIS BETTER FUTURE POSSIBLE. UNTIL NOW THIS KIND OF INTENSIVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND UTILITIES HAS NOT BEEN NECESSARY. THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS CHANGE THAT. WE NEED TO ADAPT ACCORDINGLY. DO YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING BUILT NEED TO HAVE A PLAN. RIGHT NOW FOR MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE PLAN FOR HOW TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON FOR CRITICAL FACILITIES IS DIESEL. CALIFORNIA CAN DO BETTER. I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

I'M SURE EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE REMEMBERS THE SUMMER BLACKOUTS FROM TWENTY TWENTY. ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA CALLED ON THE RELIABILITY WE RIGHT EXCUSE ME RELIABILITY DEMAND RESPONSE WHICH IS MOSTLY THE BILL UP FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS TO HELP MANAGE THE EXTREME HEAT AND ELECTRIC. ELECTRICITY USAGE AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MEGAWATTS OF LOAD WAS SHED MOST OF THAT BY THE INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE BACKUP. WITHOUT THE BACKUP THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CALL MORE ROTATING OUTAGES WHICH ILLUSTRATED NEARLY EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS AN HOUR TO FEND WITHOUT ELECTRICAL POWER. THE BIT WAS CALLED AGAIN IN THE SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY OVER THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND FIRST MUCH AS THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS AGAIN PREVENTING ROLLING BLACKOUTS FROM ENDANGERING- CALIFORNIA STORY ANOTHER EXTENDED HEAT STORM. EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS GREAT IMBALANCES AND OTHER CHALLENGES WILL CONTINUE CALIFORNIA NEEDS CLEANING EMERGENCY RELIABILITY RESOURCES THERE'S NOTHING CLEANER THAN AVOIDING CONSUMPTION TO BEGIN WITH. BY CODIFYING BIT WE ENSURED THAT THE C. P. U. C. THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION WILL INCLUDE THE EMERGENCY DEMAND RESPONSE THEIR PLANS TO AVOID ENERGY SUPPLY SHORTFALLS. SP EIGHT THIRTY NINE IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION WHOSE MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SHEDDING LOAD DURING GREAT EMERGENCIES LIKE THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY.

OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THAT SENATOR DODD NOTED IT HAD BEEN CALLED NINE TIMES EIGHT TIMES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND ONE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT CAN AND HAS BEEN CALLED SYSTEM WIDE OR ON A MORE GRANULAR BASIS IF THERE'S A LOCAL RELIABILITY NEEDS IN A LOCAL AREA. FIFTY PROGRAMS ALSO SERVE ANOTHER COURT DATE POLICY GOAL PREVENTING ECONOMIC AND EMISSIONS LEAKAGE BY PROVIDING PARTICIPATING INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS WITH A MUCH NEEDED TOOL TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT. OF THE VERY HIGH COST OF ELECTRICITY IN CALIFORNIA. F. B. EIGHT THIRTY NINE IS A STREAMLINED VERSION OF THE BILL THAT WAS VOTED OUT UNANIMOUSLY LAST YEAR BY THE COMMITTEE. IT ENSURES THAT THE CPC RETAINS DISCRETION OVER THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM FROM THE COST EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION WHICH OCCUR REGULARLY TO SETTING THE INCENTIVE LEVELS TO OTHER PROGRAM PARAMETERS. WE HAVE HAD MORE TIME TO WORK WITH INTERESTED PARTIES THAT ENGAGED WITH THAT AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE CONCERNS PROVIDED TO US DIRECTLY.

THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON BY CHURCH MEMBERS- I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS S. B. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN IS A SIMPLE SUNSET EXTENSION BILL. TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS CAN CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO BASIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. THIS BILL EXTENDS EXTENDS THE OPERATION OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH COST FUNDS BY FIVE YEARS UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXTENDED THE OPERATION OF THESE HIGH COST FUND. EIGHT TIMES SINCE THEIR CREATION THE CALIFORNIA HIGH COURT COSTS FUNDS PROVIDE RATE ASSISTANCE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS THAT MUST PROVIDE BASIC TELEPHONE PHONE SERVICES. IN AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES ARE YOU ON USUALLY HIGH. MANY OF THESE HIGH COST OR RULE COMMUNITIES- WITH- HI HI WILDFIRE RISKS AND HIGHER INFRASTRUCTURE COST. IS B. FIVE SEVEN SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA'S UNIVERSAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE POLICY BY ENABLING THE STATE TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGH COST TELECOMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT. AND ENSURING THE CALIFORNIANS AND HIGH COST COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE. AN ESSENTIAL TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES. AS PAID FIVE SEVEN HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. SENATOR NOW WE'LL GO TO OUR LEAD WITNESS SAID CHARLIE BORN AND THEN OUR SECOND LEAD WILL WITNESS PAM LOOMIS MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE T. UP OUR FIRST- LEAD WITNESS. AIRLINES ARE OPEN. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE NATURALLY BORN DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT ENSURING ALL CHARACTER PRINTER. WE ARE A LARGE- LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS SERVING IN MANY AREAS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FROM NORTH OF SAN DIEGO TO THE OREGON BORDER. AND THEN FROM COACH TOO THE NEVADA AND ARIZONA BORDERS AS WELL. SO WE INCLUDE MANY OF THE HIGH COST- RURAL AREA. IN RETURN WE OFFER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD TO EXTEND THE FRONT END OF THE FARM. PROGRAM FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS. THE PROGRAMS ARE ABOUT AFFORDABILITY M. PUBLIX'S. FIRST PORTABILITY. THE PROGRAM TO GUARANTEE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE DISTRICT BOYS SERVERS AND THE ABILITY TO CALL NINE ONE ONE. THE TRANSPORT IS PROVIDED PICTURES OF LAST RESORT ONLY FOR THE HIGH COST OF PARKS WHERE THE COSTS OF PROVIDING SERVERS. IT IS ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER MAPPED OUT WAS DETERMINED IN A LENGTHY. LOOSELY PROTECTED AND- PRINTERS MONTHLY SERVICE FOR THE- AVERAGES TWENTY TWO DOLLARS WITHOUT THE FRONT SUPPORT THE ROAD TO RECOVER THE COSTS OF PROVIDING SERVICE IN RURAL REMOTE AREAS WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT AMOUNT AND IN SOME AREAS BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IT WOULD NOT BE AFFORDABLE. SO THE GOOD BARN DOES PLAY A CRUCIAL AND FOUNDATIONAL- INSURING THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE DISTRICT SERVERS. TO ALL CUSTOMERS AND IT'S UNFAIR AND COMPETITIVELY NEUTRAL WAY TO SPREAD THESE COSTS. THROUGHOUT THE CUSTOMER BILL. THE REGARDING PUBLIC SAFETY ANNOUNCEMENT MENTIONED- IF YOU WERE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE HIGH COST AREA ON A MAP VIRTUES. WHAT A PLEASE SEE A DOCTOR THE FIRE MAP DESIGNATED AND- HI- FIRE DANGER ISN'T HERE TO ENSURE CURRENT. CLEAR A PRETTY GOOD OVERLOAD AND THEN YOU CAN AREAS- INCREASING COSTS OVER THE YEARS. ESPECIALLY.

MOREOVER THE WIRELINE VOICE SERVER IS ONLY. SERVICE AVAILABLE TO MANY OF THE HIGH FIRE DANGER AREA. INSPECTION IF THEY DON'T HAVE- BROADBAND OR WIRELESS. SO FINALLY I WANT TO KNOW THE B. TOWN CURRENTLY HAS A WHICH WILL CONTINUE DURING THE FIVE YEAR EXTENSION THROUGH THE BILL. ALL FORMS WILL CONTINUE TO REFLECT THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY THE ADDITIONAL.
