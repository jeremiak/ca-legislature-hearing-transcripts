SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION SENATOR PLACE TO BEGIN THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF FIRST OF ALL MISTER THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY ONTHIS BILL- I KNOW YOU'VE DEVOTED PERSONAL TIME AND YOUR COMMITTEE IS DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT TIME TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- I WILL BE ACCEPTING COMMITMENTS ALTHOUGH I'M GONNA SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO TWO OF THOSE AMENDMENTS. HERE A LITTLE LATER ON. THE PURPOSE THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS PRIVACY WHEN THEY- PURCHASE A DIRECT TO CONSUMER- GENETIC TESTING KIT- MANY OF US HAVE DONE SO I'VE DONE SO MY FAMILY'S DONE SO. IT'S VERY INTERESTING RESULTS BUT YOU WANT THOSE RESULTS TO SAY PRIVATE YOU DON'T WANT THOSE RESULTS TO BE DISSIPATED- PLACES WHERE IT COULD. WORK ADVERSELY TO YOUR INTEREST SO FOR EXAMPLE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT. INSURANCE OTHER AREAS. TO THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO IS TO PROTECT. YOUR GENET. AREA OF BEING LEASED WITHOUT YOUR SPECIFIC CONSENT. AS ORIGINALLY ALERTED SORT OF THE ISSUE ONE OF A MEMO LATE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WAS THE SEVENTY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE THE THAT WARN MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY NOT TO UP PROVIDE THEIR GENETIC MATERIAL TO DIRECT TO CONSUMER TESTING COMPANIES BECAUSE IT COULD BE IS FOR SUBVERSIVE PURPOSES THAT ALERTED ME TO THE FACT THAT THAT PERHAPS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK INTO IT IT. FORMED LOOK LATER N US AT. EIGHTY SPIN ISSUES IN THE BILL- ONE IS THE ISSUE OF DARK PATTERNS ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS A NETFLIX SERIES BUT IT'S NOT IT ACTUALLY- AND I THINK IT'S DESCRIBED QUITE WELL IN THE ANALYSIS- THE DARK PATTERN IS A USER INTERFACE DESIGNED OR DELAYED WITH SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT OF SUBURBAN OR IMPAIRING USER METONYMY. OR CHOICE FOR DEFINED BY. WHAT WE'VE DONE IT IS WE HAVE A ADOPTED THE DEFINITION OF A DARK PATTERN AS IS CONTAINED IN THE C. P. R. A. WHICH IS AN INITIATIVE THAT APPEAR ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER- IN ANTICIPATE THAT YOUR PASSAGE WE WANTED TO BE TESTED WITH WHAT WE'VE LOST LOCAL NEXT YOU ARE THAT. IN THIS STIFF NECK PORTION INITIATIVE DOES COME THE TWENTY TWO. BUT IT'S REAL. BOB PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WHATEVER YOUR INTERFACES IS NOT DECEPTIVE THE SECOND IS WITH RESPECT TO CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING- CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING. IS ADVERTISING THAT IS DIRECTED TO A CONSUMER BASED ON CERTAIN INFORMATION WE DO NOT WANT I DO NOT WANT I THINK MOST FOLKS DO NOT WANT ADVERTISING DIRECTED TO A CONSUMER BASED ON THEIR GENETIC MATERIAL SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF IT TURNS OUT YOU- AGE OF THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING COMPANY AND- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MAY HAVE A CERTAIN ILLNESS OR CERTAIN GENETIC PROPENSITY. YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO BE RELEASED TO A THIRD PARTY SO THAT THEY CAN DIRECT ADVERTISING CONCERNING THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE DISEASE WHATEVER IT MAY BE- HOWEVER. IF YOU SIMPLY ARE IF THE COMPANY IS SIMPLY PROVIDING- INFORMATION OR ADVERTISING BASED NOT ON THE GENETIC DATA BUT BASED ON THE FACT THAT YOU'VE ENGAGED WITH YOU KNOW FILL IN THE BLANK DIRECT TO CONSUMER- ENTITY. THAT WOULD NOT IN MY VIEW THAT WOULD NOT BE VIOLATIVE OF YOUR- RIGHT TO PROTECT YOUR GENETIC. INFORMATION AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENT BUT THIS STILL REMAINS A AN ITEM OF SOME CONTROVERSY AND MISTER CHAIR YOU AND I DISCUSSED CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE- SO. WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY US FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU SENATOR- LET'S NOW GO TO LAWS OF SUPPORT DEL WITNESSES SO STARTING WITH THE MARINE MAHONEY WITH THE CONSUMER REPORT I BELIEVE THIS TESTIFYING REMOTELY FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO WALK ON ON THIS ABOUT ONLY. WELCOME TO THE- THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY I'M- POLICY ANALYST AT CONSUMER REPORTS AND WERE STRONGLY SUPPORTING AS BE NINE EIGHTY BECAUSE IT WOULD PROVIDE IMPORTANT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OVER UNIQUELY SENSITIVE DATA- THIS DATA CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO WHETHER YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER MIGHT BE VULNERABLE TO CERTAIN THIS THIS. AND CONSUMER STRONGLY VALUE- THESE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND CONSUMERS RECENTLY SIGNED OUR PETITION CALLING ON LAWMAKERS TO ENSURE THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF THE STATE UP. MILLION CONSUMERS HAVE USE THESE TESTS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL HEALTH ISSUES MANY OF THEM LIKELY ASSUME THAT THIS HEALTH RELATED DATA IS COVER BY STRONG HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS LIKE HIP HOP. OR CMI AA- WHICH REQUIRE CONSENT FOR MOST IS CLOSER. TO THIRD PARTIES HOWEVER DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING COMPANIES. IN CALIFORNIA REGULATED CHIEFLY BY THE SEA CPA IN WHICH STUDENTS ARE DAHLE MODEL COULD ALLOW THESE COMPANIES BY DEFAULT TO LEGALLY SELL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES. THIS WILL REQUIRE COLLECTION SECOND USE AND DISCLOSURE OF THE STATE- IMPORTANTLY THERE'S A PROVISION GIVING CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO REVOKE CONSENT PUTTING CONSUMERS CORALINE CONTROL. IS ALSO A STRONG DEFINITION OF CONSENT WHICH INSUES THAT CONSUMERS CAN MAKE MEANINGFUL CHOICES WITH RESPECT TO THIS ERA. AND DATA SECURITY PROVISION WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF SECURITY BREACHES OF THESE COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS. INCLUDING ONE AT CHEN MATCH IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS. ALREADY STATES LIKE ILLINOIS AND MISSOURI HAVE STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OVER THE STATE UP. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS HAVE THE SAME AND WE ARE JUST SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT WITNESS I BELIEVE IS JOHN VERITY WITHOUT FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORUM ALSO. VIA THE TELEPHONE IS- MISTER VERY ARE YOU ON THE LINE. ON THE LINE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES TO CREATE THAT PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU A MONIES JOHN VERDY I AM VICE PRESIDENT POLICY AT THE FUTURE OF PRIVACY FORM WE ARE A- NONPARTISAN NON PROFIT THINK TANK IN WASHINGTON DC. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFEGUARDING CONSUMERS GENETIC INFORMATION. SB NINE EIGHTY WOULD CREATE IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND STANDARDIZE EMERGING BEST PRACTICES FOR DATA PROTECTION IN IRAQ. TO MERGING EXIT. I NEED IN MY VIEW WOULD DO THIS IN A WAY THAT COMPANIES CAN OPERATIONALIZE. WHY DO I THINK THIS WELL. I THINK THIS IS A WELL BALANCED APPROACH BECAUSE LEADING COMPANIES ARE ALREADY IMPLEMENTING THESE SORTS OF PROTECTIONS AND SB NINE EIGHTY WOULD EXTEND THOSE PROTECTIONS WALL CONSUMER. FORGET COST THE STREET. IN JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE FUTURE PRIVACY FORM RELEASED BEST PRIVACY BEST PRACTICES FOR CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING SERVICES. WE DEVELOP THESE BEST PRACTICES FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTS REGULATORS. LEADING CONSUMER GENETIC AND PERSONAL DRAMA TESTING COMPANIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THESE BEST PRACTICES INCLUDE STRICT STANDARDS FOR THE USE AND SHARING OF GENETIC INFORMATION GENERATED IN THE CONSUMER CONTEXT. INCLUDING STRONG REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW COMPANIES COLLECT USE AND SHARE GENETIC INFORMATION. REQUIREMENTS OF EXPRESS FUHRMAN OF CANCER AS A BASELINE REQUIREMENT FOR COLLECTING GENETIC INFORMATION. SEPARATE EXPRESS CONSENT FOR THE USE OF GENETIC MATERIAL OUTSIDE THE INITIAL SCOPE OF COLLECTION. SECONDARY EXPRESS CONSENT IS ALSO REQUIRED BEFORE COMPANY ENGAGES IN ON WILL TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL LEVEL INFORMATION. AND FPS BEST PRACTICES AND SB NINE EIGHTY WOULD PROVIDE STRONG INCENTIVES TO DE IDENTIFY DNA DATA TO BETTER PROTECT IT- AND ALSO GRANT CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS CORRECT OR DELETE GENETIC INFORMATION. SB NINE EIGHTY WOULD LIMIT SHARING WITH ENTITIES LIKE EMPLOYERS ARE INSURANCE COMPANIES EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITHOUT A CONSUMER'S CONSENT. RISKS CAN ARISE SHARING THAT ARE TOP OF MIND FOR CONSUMERS AND I'LL SAY A FINAL WORD ABOUT THE MARKETING- PROVISIONS OF SB NINE EIGHTY IT IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK ALL DAY THE REPRESENTATIVES AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAVE DONE TO NAVIGATE THESE DIFFICULT ISSUES. HAPPY WE FOUND. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE A GREAT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND ALL IN OR OPT OUT CONSENT FOR SENSITIVE DATA. WE'VE ALSO FOUND ON THIS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE INCENTIVES AND LAW INDIAN RULE ON FOR COMPANIES TO AGE IN LESS INVASIVE. NON INVASIVE ADVERTISING PRACTICED. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT COMPANIES MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN OBTAINING OPT IN CONSENT. FOR MARKETING BASED ON VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION WILL PROVIDE OPT OUT CONSENT. OKAY BASS ON WHAT. GEN FOR ENGAGING IN TAX ADVERTISING IT TYPICALLY DOES NOT USE INFORMATION ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL BUT RATHER TARGETED ADVERTISING TO THE CON OF THE WEB PAGE OR INTERNET- WE THINK IT'S A HEALTHY THING FOR THE A LEGAL SYSTEM TO PROVIDE TENNIS FOR COMPANIES. TWENTY LESSEN TRUTH FOR BETTER TIES AND RATHER THAN MORE INTRUSIVE FORMS OF ADVERTISING. ONE FINAL NOTE- I WOULD FLAG THAT IN IN THE VERY STRESSED THE BILL I KNOW FOLKS ARE- MOVING TOWARDS CONSENSUS LANGUAGE- AROUND HOW TO HANDLE ADVERTISING IN A CONTEXT- OF CONTEXTUAL BASEMENT- AND I THINK THAT THERE IS THERE IS MORE CONVERSATION PERHAPS TO BE HAD. ABOUT THE EXACT SENATOR OF THOSE EVER. WAYS THAT CAN BE. COMPLIED WITH BY COMP. AND ALSO WAY USED IT IS FORMALLY PROTECT CONSUMERS SO TO THE EXTENT THAT FOLKS ARE ARE FOCUSED ON ON THE NITTY GRITTY WORKS NOTHING OF WHETHER A PARTICULAR ADVERTISEMENTS ARE INTENDED- TO BE SEEN BY CERTAIN AUDIENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE SEEN BY CERTAIN AUDIENCES. I THINK THAT THERE IS A FURTHER. BEST FRIEND THOSE RULES THAT THEY CAN BECOME. TO MARS AND APPROPRIATELY IMPLEMENTED BY COMPANIES I THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ARE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WHAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VERITY ELSEWHERE TESTIMONY BEFORE WE GO TO THE- NEXT WITNESS LET'S ESTABLISH OUT QUORUM. CHANNEL KILEY THEIR POWER CAN HAND HERE BERMAN YOUR CALDERON CARILLO GABRIEL GALA.

YOU CAN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WORKING THE OPPOSITION AND WORKING WITH THE- PRIVACY ADVOCATES- TO TRY TO. BE A REAL. BILL ACCOUNT TO YOUR BALLS. BEING THIS A LINK IN SOME ON ON INDEED AND THE BIZ THAT WILL BE IMPACTED SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT COMING IN THE COMMITTEE- YOU YOU HAD A GOOD COMPROMISE BILL THAT LIKE IT HAD UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AND EVERYBODY WAS ON BOARD AND SOME AMENDMENTS PROPOSED- THAT. INITIALLY CREATED SOMECONCERN THAT IN OPPOSITION AND THERE'S A SECOND ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS AND THE A LOT OF THE- INDUSTRY AND A POSSIBLE OPPOSITION IT SEEMS TO BE COMFORTABLE ON 9% OF IS THAT WE HAVE FOR US TODAY A NUMBER THERE'S REALLY THIS ISSUE OF THE IN THE TEXT WHAT AS MID SECTION. THEY'RE NOT WE- WORDS EXPECT VERSUS. IS ALL IN DESPERATE EXPOSURE AND IS RARELY RARELY DO WE SEE IN THE LEGISLATURE SUCH A BIG IMPORTANT COMPLICATE. AND CHANGE. TWO WORDS AND REPLACE IT WITH. ALMOST EVERYBODY WOULD BE IN SUPPORT NOT EVERYBODY I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME GROUPS THAT MIGHT STILL BE POSE BUT BUT THE COMPANIES THAT WILL BE IMPACTED THE MOST- WOOD ALL THE SUDDEN FLIP FROM FROM SUPPORTIVE AMENDED TO SEE OR FOR THE BILL SO I JUST WANT TO TRY TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF YOU KNOW WE'RE- WE'RE TO. FROM WOULD IF YOU WANT COMMITTEE I. IN THIS REASONABLY X. LANGUAGE WOULD ALSO LOVE GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING FROM THE AUTHOR- AS TO WHETHER OR NOT EITHER YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OPTIONS OR IF YOU'RE A BILL IT TO TYLER OPTION FOR ME AS I KIND OF DIED THINK OF WHAT I'M pALL AT THE EARLY RETIREMENT MAYBE TURN OVER TO THE AUTHOR HE HAS ANY QUOTE- RESPONSE IT OUT BEFORE I DURING. AND I THINK 90% OF THE BILL HAS COME pTO. A VISIT OF ACCEPTANCE BE DESCRIBED AS FOLKS ARE SEWN BUT NOT MUTINOUS WHICH IS WHERE YOU WANT. YOUR SO. AB CONCERNING PARTICULAR A BIT OF A LANGUAGE- THAT THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AD NAUSEAM- I WE HAVE ACCEPTED THOSE AMENDMENTS BUT I AM CERTAINLY WILLING TO DEFERRED TO THE SENSE OF THE COMMITTEE AS TO WHETHER OF THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT THAT WE SHOULD STOP THE TWO WORD INTENDED FOR. THE TERM IS REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF. WE AS WAS ILLUSTRATED BY THE WITNESSES- WE DON'T WANT TO PUNISH COMPANIES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE ADVERTISING- IN A GENERIC FASHION TO ALL THE CONSUMERS WHO HAVING GATE. IN CANCER AND IT HAPPENS THAT YOU THAT YOU RECEIVE AN AD CONCERNING SOME SORT OF- BREAST CANCER ISSUE- IT IF IT'S NOT BASED ON THE INFORMATION DERIVED FROM THE GENETIC TESTING IS SIMPLY A GENERIC IT'S DISSEMINATED TO ANYBODY IS ENGAGED AYE AYE I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE TAPPED. AND I'M IN A YEAR. WE DEFINITELY MAKES PEOPLE'S PERSONAL INFORMATION ISN'T USE OR ABUSE BY THE COMPANY'S BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO INHIBIT THE COMPANIES TO THE POINT THAT THEY CAN'T YEAH PROVIDE. USEFUL INFORMATION TO THEIR THEIR CUSTOMERS- JUST SO LONG AS THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY USING THE INFORMATION THAT COMES BACK IN THE TEST WHICH WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS YOUR- PRIORITY WHICH I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH AND RESPECT- YOU KNOW WE ARE. IN THE BE. TIRED HOME. IN KEEP THE CAR GOING BUT WE ARE THE POLICY COMMITTEE AND WE ARE THE LAST POLICY COMMITTEE TO. REVIEW THIS THIS BILL IN THIS LANGUAGE BEFORE THE BALL MOVES FORWARD IF THE MOVE TOWARD SO I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IT'S AND THAT WE- GET SOME REST. TO ISSUE TODAY. AND NO TO HEAR THE COP AND THEN HERE I CALLED TO HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT BUT- I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT IT'S OUR ROLE TO JUST KINDA. BUT THE CONVERSATION. IT I CAN YOU KNOW THE- WHETHER CHANGE TODAY SO I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY WHAT WHAT THE CHAIR AS THE SAME TURN WHY. THE COMMITTEE MIGHT I AM NOT A REASONABLY EXPECTED VERSES INTENDED- BUT I PERSONALLY I LEAN TOWARDS INTENDED- BEING THE RIGHT KIND OF MIDDLE GROUND- FOR THIS ISSUE WHERE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE CAR IS ARE ABUSING MISSION THEY HAVE. THEY'RE STILL ABLE HELPFUL. EVER TO THEIR COST SO FEDERAL. YOUR BACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS BERMAN LET'S GO TO MR OBERNOLTE NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF CENTER THANKS FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. I WONDER IF YOU COULD WALK US THROUGH. THE NECESSITY FOR THE BILL FROM THE STATE OF LOS FREEDOM HORRIBLE'S THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN. YEAH THERE WAS A MULLIN. USE THIS GENETIC DATA SO- I MEAN YOU'VE RAISED SOME SOME INTERESTING. CASES IN THE BILL FOR EXACT. COUNT. IN THAT CASE IF THAT WAS OF CONCERN TO ME AS A CONSUMER I COULD JUST PICK A GENETIC TESTING COMPANY WHO HAD PLEDGED NOT TO DO THAT. RIGHT SO I BUT I KNOW THAT THEIR LARGER SOCIETAL WAS INVOLVED I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE A MINUTE AND TALK ABOUT- WITH C. AS IS- THE EFFECTS OF THIS. THAT THAT. A GREAT QUESTION. WHAT WHAT. DO IS TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE CONSUMER PROVIDES INFORMED CONSENT. SO IF THE CONSUMER WISHES THEY HAVE THEIR- INFORMATION DISSEMINATE WHILE IN SOME MAY. SO MAYBE ONE OF YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE RECEIVE ADVERTISEMENTS THAT PERTAIN TO A PARTICULAR GENETIC. MAKE UP. THAT'S JUST NEED TO CONSERVE TO THAT. THE GOOD. NEWS IS IT IF YOU HAVEN'T CONSENTED. THEN YOU'RE IN. BY THE- BACK. MO OF THE BE COME TO DO TO CONSUMER TESTING DO ABIDE BY A CODE OF ETHICS THAT IS LARGELY EMBODIED IN THIS BILL SO I DON'T WANT TO CAST ASPERSIONS AN INDUSTRY WHERE THAT'S NOT WHAT TO OUR SON OUT LIARS WHO THE AMPLE MAY PROVIDE THEY'RE NOT PRO SECURE THAT CAN BE ACCESSED. ALL SORTS OF- WILL JUST DIDN'T SORT OF DOING. DO YOU ALLOW REESE. BUT OTHERS THE THAT MAY WANT TO USE IT TO FOR EXAMPLE IDENTIFY- A POPULATION HAS A SPECIFIC GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO AN ILLNESS. AND EVER AS TWO OR EVEN FALSE EYES AS TO EMBODIES THAT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE EFFICACIOUSAND SO THOSE CONCERNS- PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT. THAT WHEN YOU PROVIDE THAT VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT. TO KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL SHOOT THE SIDE OF. OKAY I THANK YOU I ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF GENETIC DATA FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THIS IS A AREA OF RESEARCH AND A LOT OF THE HUMAN SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENTS TO TAKE PLACE COUNTRY OVER A CUP OUT OF OUR THEY'RE NOT A- PILOT GENETIC DATA. CAN YOU BROUGH SHOULD THE BILL TOMORROW HOW A- INSTITUTION WOULD GO ABOUT GET A HOLD OF ANONYMIZE DATA WHETHER AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF ONE THAT WAS PURCHASED. SO THE QUESTION W WERE WITH THE RECEIPT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I SHARE YOUR INTEREST AND CONCERN THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN THIS TIME OF COVERT CRISIS THAT THAT WE BE ABLE TO. HAVE AS MUCH RESEARCH DONE AS POSSIBLE BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU. PURCHASE AND YOU CONSENT TO HAVING YOUR MATERIAL USED RESEARCH PURPOSES WHICH MOST PEOPLE DO. THEN THEN IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED SPECIFIC IN INDIVIDUAL. IT'S THE- IN DECEMBER THAT FASHION OKAY. AND I'M NOT LASTLY I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A SETTLEMENT BERMAN'S COMMENTS ABOUT THIS THIS DIFFERENT THIS DEFINITION DEBT DIFFERENCE IN DEFINITION BETWEEN REASONABLY EXPECTED INTENDED I SHARE THAT CONCERN AS WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYONE'S IN HERE PUT LIMITATIONS ON TEST MAYES. WAS ABOUT AS IN THE DOOR JUST FOR. CHECK OUT BUT IS THE END UP WITH US WHAT WE- WHAT IT IS AT THE OF THE DISCUSSION. AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. I THINK IT QUICKLY ILLUSTRATE DIFFERENT. AT THAT WERE BEING AS THE FACT THAT THE MORE SOMETHING. YOU MIGHT HAVE IT ON AN OUTSIDE MIGHT HAVE A NEXT. THAT THE TAKE RATE FOR AN OFF WOULD BE BRENT FOR DIFFERENT IF. SUFFEREDYOUR PAYING A- ONE I BET. OFF TO EVERY OUR NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED AS BEING DIABETIC BECAUSE OF THEIR GENETIC DATA BUT- THE STATISTICAL DATA SOME ETHIC GROUP IS MORE PREVALENT IN- CONTRACTING DIABETES AND OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS SO I MEAN IF YOU'RE REASONABLE QUESTION THAT THE TAKE RATE FROM. BUT YOU'RE NOT. SO I JUST THINK TO BE FAIR AND IMPOSE THE SAME RULES ON THESE COMPANIES AS EXIST FOR OTHER COMPANIES AND I THINK THAT THAT WORDING CHANGE WOULD DO THAT SO WHAT THANK YOU FOR. YOUR HARD WORK. THANK YOU. OPEN LET'S GO TO MISS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AM I TO WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR IT IS- WE DISCUSSED PRIOR TO THIS I HAVEN'T USED ONE OF THESE SERVICES BECAUSE I'M SO CONCERNED. SINCE THE COME UP. WAS SAID BY THE WIND IS BELIEVE THESE ARE PROTECTED BY HAVE A AND OTHER I'M PROTECTIONS AND THEY ARE NOT AND SO I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE TAKE THIS STEP IN PROTECTING THIS WHAT I BELIEVE THE MOST PER. AND THAT NOW IS THAT. PLACE THANK YOU FOR THAT SO WHEN I COME YOU BECAUSE- TO MISTER BERMAN'S POINT. NOT OFTEN DO YOU HEAR BILLS COMMAND ESPECIALLY THIS NATURE WHERE YOU HAVE.

HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION TO EITHER JUST SAID WE SHOULD KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT AND- I'M- RESPECT. I WISH. IN THEIR EXPERTISE ON THIS YET. WHAT THE REASON WITH THAT I AGREE WITH MR THE SAME OR FOR THIS AND HOW QUICKLY THINGS ARE MOVING THAT WE NEED TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE OUT OF HERE IN A CONDITION THAT IS MOST ADVOCATE.

SO IN IN PARTICULAR AS A MATTER OF POLICY ALLOWING GENETIC TESTING COMPANIES TO ADVERTISE BASED. ON THE CONSUMERS PURCHASE HISTORY ONLY UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS UNLESS OBTAINING CONSENT IS I BELIEVE OR WE BELIEVE IS TO APPROPRIATE BALLOTS. NOW IS REASON. IT'S ALSO A SERVICE. THE KIND TEXTUAL HAVE AS WE HEARD. BY REQUIRING PROMINENT LABELLING OF TIES CAUGHT AND PROHIBITING. ADVERTISE WITH MS REASON BACK TO HAVE A CUENTA EFFECT. NOW SO THE A IS WAY WE SHOULD USE THAT THE REASONABLE EXPECT AND WORST INTENTION OF STANDARD UP. I WANNA I WANNA STRESSED OUT OF THE STANDARD- RELIES ON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF ADVERTISING RATHER THAN. XIN OF THE EVERY TIME TO PREVENT INDIRECT- DISCRIMINATORY ADVERTISING PRACTICES FROM GETTING- AROUND YOU KNOW DISPLAY YOU KNOW THIS IS. SOMEWHAT OF A PROBLEM THAT. AND THE REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IS REALLY A STANDARD METRIC USED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ALL IT IS RARE THAT SOMEBODY INTENDS TO DISCRIMINATE OR CREATE DESPERATE IMPACT WHAT WE CARE ABOUT AND LAW IS THE FACT NOT REALLY THE INTENT. ARM YEAH I THINK THE COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED THAT DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING COMPANY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MARKET TO CONSUMERS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT SO LONG AS THE DESPERATE- IMPACT ISN'T EXPECTED NOW THIS IS THE LESSER STANDARD. THEN OF WHAT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSE LAST WEEK- BUT YET STILL PROTECTIVE TEND TO SEE CPA. AND ALSO STAND APART THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REALLY THE- TWO OF THE BALLOT IN THE TO BE IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT. MEANT TO THE ALL AND ALSO TO THE STAKEHOLDERS. ARE IS TO- CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BECAUSE THIS AMENDMENT ACTUALLY WAS A PROPOSED LAST FRIDAY SO WE NEED A LITTLE LITTLE MORE TIME. TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS BUT I'M DEFINITELY OPEN- TO LOOKING AT THAT STANDARD. OB SO. IN A YOU KNOW I THINK THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE CITED BY OUR INTERNET ASSOCIATE ABOUT THE BREAST CANCER. WOMEN SHOULD THE T. HE SAYS HERE WOMEN SHOULD ONLY BE MORE LIKELY TO CD AT TEN MEN IF YOU HAVE AT TIMES BEEN IS BEING BASED ON THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH READY IS NOT PERMITTED BUT THEY ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO ADVERTISE ACCORDINGLY SO LONG AS THEY OBTAIN CONSENT FROM THE CONSUMER SO UP TO THE- YOU KNOW. SOMEONE IN BETWEEN C. C. P. A. N. ALSO HIPAA. YEAH AND THAT'S THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE BELIEVE STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE BUT IT BUT I DO HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES WHO REGARDING TO YOUR CONCERN. AND I'M COMMITTED TO MAKING OF YOU DON'T FOR THE CHANGES TO IT BEFORE IT GOES TO THE NEXT STOP A WHICH IS THE PROCREATION SO WE DO HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME THIS IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH AND- BUILT. SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME I CAN THIS IS THE LAST. OF MEETING WE NEED TO SEARCH FOR THIS OUT THE- SHOULD SO I DO I DO I COMMIT MYSELF TO DOING THAT AND I WANT TO MEET MY STAFF TEAM TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. SO YOU KNOW THE SURE YOU GONNA BE RESOLVED IT'S SO. WAS OPEN. RIGHT OR I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY. THE BILL BUT WITH THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE WORD. INTENDED FOR THE WORD THREE LOOKS LIKE. SECOND WE HAVE MISTER I DON'T THINK THAT'S A I THINK WHAT'S APPROPRIATE IS THAT AT THIS POINT WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU IN THE COMMITTEE ARE WORKING WITH THE WITH THE OFFICE WITH THE AUTHOR TO WORK AT THIS SUPPORT POSITION. THAT WE TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD CONTINUE TO WORK AND POSITION YOU'RE NOT VERY FAR APART YOU'RE VERY CLOSE THIS COMMITTEE GOES APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THAT I SAID ON. I THINK THAT. IT WE NEED TO ALLOW YOU THE TOP TO FIND THAT COMMON GROUND I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THEN ADOPT THIS LANGUAGE IS AN AMENDMENT- IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE INTO ALLOW YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. AND YEAH IN THE EVENT THAT YOU CAN'T GET THERE THEN THERE ARE THINGS.

BECOMES LAW AND SO I THINK IT REALLY BEHOOVES US TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE NOW AND I THINK IF IT. REQUIRES MORE TIME. THEN WE SHOULD TAKE THAT TIME FOR PASSING THAT BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE. I THINK THAT THIS IS A- PROPER PIES AND OTHER. ALL RIGHT. THERE WAS A MOTION ON TABLE THERE'S A FAIR. THE MR IF THE TWENTY SOMETHING OKAY ANYONE ELSE WILL WANT TO DISCUSS. SURE GLAD.
