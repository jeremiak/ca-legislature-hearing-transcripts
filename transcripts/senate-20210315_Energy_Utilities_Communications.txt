NOT ONLY CAN OUR- CLERK HERE YOU PUT. THE PUBLIC AS WELL- NOW WE ARE GONNA- MOVE OVER TO OUR NEXT. PRESENTER CENTER SKINNER ON S. B. EIGHTEEN THE BILL RELATED TO GREEN. HYDROGEN WELCOME CENTER SKINNER PLEASE WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CARE MEMBERS- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. THE REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS RICHER OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS- SO APPRECIATE THAT. HYDROGEN IS MOST OF US KNOW IS THE MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT BASIC ELEMENT IN THE UNIVERSE. AND IT IS POISED TO HELP CALIFORNIA AND THE ENTIRE WORLD MOVED TO A LOWER TO NO CARBON ECONOMY. WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED. WHAT HYDROGEN CAN DO IT IS. ONCE PRODUCED THROUGH ELECTROLYSIS STORE EXCESS RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY OUR SON OUR SOLAR AND WIND INSTALLATIONS SO THAT WE CAN THEN DEPLOY IT LATER. IT CAN ALSO BE A- IT CAN. IN FACT BE A THE PRODUCTION OF IT COULD BE A PRODUCTIVE USE FOR THE ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF WASTE WHICH IS WE KNOW PRODUCES METHANE AND SUCH AND WE CAN USE THAT NOTHING TO. POWER STEAM REFORMATION OR GASIFICATION TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN. AND THE OTHER BENEFITS OF HYDROGEN IS THAT IT CAN DECARBONISE DIFFICULT SECTORS LIKE SHIPPING LONG HAUL TRUCKING AIR TRAVEL SO MUCH AND BECAUSE IT COULD POTENTIALLY USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IT PRESERVES WELL PAYING JOBS. WHAT SB EIGHTEEN SPECIFICALLY DOES IS IT VANCE'S GREEN HYDROGEN BY ESTABLISHING A DEFINITION SO FAR THE ONLY DEFINITION WE HAVE BEEN CODE IS FOR GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN SO THIS ADDS A DEFINITION OF GREEN HYDROGEN. AND IT ASKS ARE YOUR RESOURCES BOARD TO ADD HYDROGEN TO THE SCOPING PLAN SAID WE HAVE ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR TOOL KIT. AND IT CLARIFIES THE GREEN HYDROGEN IS A ZERO CARBON RESOURCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD AND INTEGRATED INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN. IT REQUIRES OUR PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO ADD GREEN HYDROGEN INTO. RICHARD CONSIDERATIONS AROUND OUR EXISTING ENERGY STORAGE PROCUREMENT FIVE STATUTES SO LET ME NOW TURN TO MY- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THERE'S JANICE LAND FROM THE GREEN HYDROGEN COALITION AND JAMIE LEVIN FOR THE CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT. MODERATOR CAN WE ASK JANICE LYNN. TO SPEAK IF SHE'S AVAILABLE THERE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THINK CAREFULLY SO AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS JENNIFER AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE GREEN HYDROGEN COALITION OR GHC. FOR A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT WHOSE MISSION IS TO ADVANCE GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION I'M- ASKING L. TO ACCELERATE MULTI SECTORAL DECARBONISATION. AS SENATOR SKINNER MENTIONED GREEN HYDROGEN IS TRULY A GAME CHANGER IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE IT'LL ENABLE THE DECARBONISATION OF REALLY DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE FACTORSTHAT ARE NOT EASILY ELECTRIFIED. AND IMPORTANTLY AND AFFORDABLE AND RESPONSIBLE TRANSITION OUR FIRST POSSIBLE INTEREST OF TIME I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THREE KEY REASONS. FIRST GREEN HYDROGEN IT'S A GREAT WAY TO ELECTRIFYING AND CARBONIZED FUEL SUPPLY. MEETING AT SENATOR SKINNER MENTIONED WE CAN CONVERT ARE ABUNDANT LOW COST WIND AND SOLAR AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES AND OTHER WASTE PRODUCTS INTO A FLEXIBLE ZERO CARBON FUEL THAT CAN DISPLACING MANY FOSSIL FUEL APPLICATIONS INCREASING. RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY. SECONDLY CREATE HIGH WE CAN REPAIR VALUABLE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AFFORDABLE ENERGY TRANSITION AS AN EXAMPLE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER IS IN THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING ITS LAST REMAINING COAL PLANTS I. P. P. LOCATED IN CENTRAL UTAH. TO A COMBINED CYCLE GREEN HYDROGEN GAS TURBINE. I THINK HE WILL COMMENCE OPERATIONS SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WITH A 30% GREEN HYDROGEN LAND INCREASING THAT PERCENTAGE 21100% ON OR BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE. I. P. P. IS THE LARGEST GREEN HYDROGEN PROJECT IN NORTH AMERICA TODAY AND WILL ENABLE YOUR PORTABLE DISPATCHABLE RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY AND RELIABILITY FUTURE FOR THE REFERENCE. RESIDENTS OF THAT RIGHT. THIRD REASON AND I SENATORS- TO VERY WELL GREEN. GEN A TREND ECONOMIC TO THE AND FOR OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S A FAST GROWING GLOBALLY TRADED COMMODITY WITH LARGE EXPORT POTENTIAL. ALREADY MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE VYING TO BECOME THE LEADING GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCER GLOBALLY INCLUDING AUSTRALIA CHILE SPAIN AND EVEN SAUDI ARABIA. I WANT US TO BE THAT TOP PRODUCER MY FAVORITE NATION STATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS SO MANY GLOBAL ADVANTAGES FOR THE PRODUCTION AND EXPORT OF GREEN HYDROGEN. INCLUDING ABUNDANT RENEWABLE FEEDSTOCKS SKILLED WORKFORCE HI TOWARDS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE MANY LARGE LOCAL USES A GREEN HYDROGEN CUT THE SELLER TAKES GAILLAC. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LEADERSHIP. SB EIGHTEEN IS ESSENTIAL TO ESTABLISHING AN APPROPRIATE VISION AND LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THIS EMERGING GLOBAL GREEN HYDROGEN ECONOMY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR EITHER THANK YOU. MODERATOR CAN YOU ALSO NOW Q. JAMIE. ELEVEN YES SIR. SURE HUESO AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE THIS IS JAMIE LEVIN I PRESUME YOU CAN HEAR ME YES WELL I AM THE DIRECTOR OF WEST COAST OPERATIONS CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT I AM LOCATED IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA OUR FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION IS COMMITTED TO THE DEPLOYMENT. OF AND TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SPECIFICALLY IN THE HEAVY DUTY MARKET WE HAVE BEEN RECIPIENTS OF FUNDS FOR FUEL CELL TRUCKS BUSES MARINE CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT. AND WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND OUR OWN ENDEAVORS WORKING WITH VARIOUS TRANSIT AGENCIES IN FLEET OPERATORS THE SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF THESE VEHICLES BASED ON THEIR EXTENDED RANGE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED MILES ON A SINGLE FILL. THEIR PAYLOAD CAPACITY IN THE ABILITY TO FUEL QUICKLY AND THEY ARE PROVING NOW THERE IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT. TO THE ELECTRIFICATION OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE CONVERSION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. WE HAVE WE ARE ME MEANING. TANK TO. ZERO MISSION. BUT WE CANNOT MEET THREE WELL TO WHEEL IT UNLESS WE PURSUE THE- LEGISLATION THAT SENATOR SKINNER HAS PROPOSED TO THE S. B. HE- WE HAVE THE DEMAND GROWING IMPROVING ITS VIABILITY WE NEED THE FUEL SUPPLY COULD BE GREAT TO BE MADE GREEN AND AFFORDABLE SENATOR. SKINNER'S BILL WILL HELP PURSUE AN ACCELERATE THE EFFORTS OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN THE QC TO DELIVER THE GREEN HYDROGEN THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR STREETS GOALS OF TRANSFORMING OUR TRANSIT INDUSTRY TO GENERAL MISSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT. THANK YOU MISTER LEVIN WOULD PER SHARE COMMENTS NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE GALLERY HERE FOR THE PUBLIC. MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC PUBLIC HERE IN THE GALLERY WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTEEN. NOBODY NOW WILL GO TO ROOM. ONE TWELVE. ANYONE AND NO THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANYBODY IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. NOW WILL GO TO- WITNESSES TESTIFYING VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYBODY OF THAT.

GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS MEMBERS JULIE ARE LETTING ON BEHALF OF THE BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SH WE ARE LISTED IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTEEN BUT- FOR THE MOMENT OUR POSITION IS ACTUALLY SUPPORT IF AMENDED. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THIS BILL AND AGREE WITH SENATOR SKINNER AND THE SPONSOR THAT SRI HYDROGEN IS CRITICAL TO THE STATE'S PERMITTING POLICIES AND CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SENATOR SKINNER AND HER STAFF ON THE DEFINITION OF GREEN HYDROGEN UNFORTUNATELY THE DEFINITION THE BILL RIGHT NOW- DOES NOT TAKE A LIFE CYCLE BASED APPROACH AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL- FOR THE DEFINITION GREEN HYDROGEN AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANY PERFORMANCE STANDARDS NEED TO BE APPLIED. TO ALL SOURCES OF GREEN HYDROGEN EQUALLY- BUT WE ASSUME THAT WE CAN WORK OUT THOSE CHANGES WITH THE SENATOR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER AND THE COMMITTEE. ON THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO LEAVE ANY OTHER. YES WE DO WOMAN. THE NEXT ONE IN LINE NUMBER FIFTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS HIT ME FAN ON BEHALF OF AN E. AT THE COURT THANK YOU.

TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND GREEN HYDROGEN AND ZERO CARBON ENERGY RESOURCES PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON THE MAP IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET LEADER IN GREEN HYDROGEN AND ACCELERATED TOWARD STATES CLEAN ENERGY GOALS THANK IN ORDER MIND THE COLORS TO STATE YOUR NAME. THE ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL BUT NEXT BIGGER PLEASE. LINE NUMBERS SIXTY TO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AMERICAN PARKING REQUESTING STATE PATROL IN THE SITUATION WE ACTUALLY CALLED ME A NEUTRAL POSITION ON THE BELL AND THEN JUST TO CLARIFY THAT POSITION OUR MEMBERS ARE ENGAGED I LIKE THE PART ABOUT WE NEED TO.

THAT THE CLARIFIER POSITION REAL QUICK GIVEN HOW INCREDIBLY COMPLEX ISSUE IT'S FROM VIDAK BUT I DON'T G. FORCES THE PRODUCTION PRACTICES THAT COULD BE USED IN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR AND PRECISE AND CRACKING DEFINITION THE BILL. ON THE GOAL OF DIRECTING AGENCIES TO EXPLORE QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT RATHER THAN LOCKING IN AN OVERLY BROAD DEFINITION OF STATUTE THAT COULD LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SHOULD FINALLY THINKING ABOUT FOCUSING THE USE OF GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN ON FACTORS WHETHER FEW OTHER DECARBONISATION ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE BUT AGAIN. REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE TIME THE SENATOR STOPPED AT THE SPENDING ON THE BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO FASHION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT BIGGER. SPEEDLINE SIR WHO YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

OKAY THANK YOU ARE NOT CAN WE- ASK FOR SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. CAN WE HAVE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. MODERATOR. THE MODERATOR THERE. SB EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR THERE IS THERE'S ONE PERSON WITH AN OPERATOR AT THIS MOMENT. AT NINE THIRTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JAMIE COUNCILLORSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. APPRECIATE THE OTHERS LEADERSHIP ON CLEAN ENERGY HOWEVER WE MUST OPPOSE SB EIGHTEEN UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO NO LONGER INCLUDE A DEFINITION OF. GREEN HYDROGEN SOURCES THAT POLLUTE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND MAKE INCREASE METHANE EMISSIONS WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT HYDROGEN GENERATED FROM BIOGAS. DAIRIES BEING DEFINED AND MARKETED AS GREEN ENERGY. HE DIED DO ALMOST NOTHING TO MEDIATE THE SEVERE WATER AND AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS BUT ESPECIALLY LARGE KERRY HOW. ON NEARBY LOW INCOME SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY COMMUNITIES AND IN FACT ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXACERBATE THOSE IMPACTS BY ENCOURAGING LARGE SCALE OPERATIONS AND INCREASED HER EXACT SIZES. YOUR BIO METHANE INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'D BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS THESE CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. FOR WILL WILL COME TO THE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATORS ANYONE WISHING TO COMMENT- CENTER DOLLY. VICE CHAIR THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR I WILL I WANT TO JUST THANK THE AUTHOR FIRST OF ALL- I NEVER THOUGHT I'D LIVE TO SEE THE DAY WHERE WE ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT A GREAT. REALLY CLEAN ENERGY THAT'S AVAILABLE- ALL OUT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S A BETTER TRANSITION ENERGY THAN BATTERIES QUITE FRANKLY HYDROGEN PUTS OUT WATER. WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S USED FOR FUEL AND- WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH ALL THE BATTERIES AFTER WE GET DONE SO I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL I DO HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR THOUGH- CAN YOU COULD PLEASE CLARIFY. FOR THE RECORD AND THAT IS WOODY BIOMASS PART OF THIS GREEN ENERGY- GREEN GREEN HYDROGEN I SHOULD SAY- THROUGH THE CHAIR THE CIRCUIT. YES OKAY THANK YOU REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SO IN THE ANALYSIS YOU WILL NOTE THAT THE- THERE IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE NOTIONS OF KERKORIAN'S MEDIA GET THE ROOM TO BE WAS A TURQUOISE BUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT BLUE HYDROGEN AGREE NITROGEN THESE VARIOUS- THEY'RE NOT IN STATUTES YET BUT- AS I INDICATED BEFORE THE ONLY THING WE HAVE IN STATUTES YET A FOR A DEFINITION IS GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO HERE. IS CREATING DEFINITION FOR ANY HYDROGEN PRODUCED BY KNOWN FOSSIL FUEL FEEDSTOCKS SO THAT OF COURSE WOULD INCLUDE WOODY BIOMASS NOW AS YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THE SCREENERS THERE THEY HAVE A CONCERN THAT- PERHAPS THE DEFINITION WOULD BE WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT WOULD EXCLUDE IT THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENTION THOUGH- CLEARLY THERE'S STILL- DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAD WITH STAKEHOLDERS BUT AT THE MOMENT. I VIEW THE WOODY BIOMASS AS A NON FOSSIL FUEL SOURCE AND SHOULD BE ONE OF THE FEEDSTOCKS FOR GREEN HYDROGEN. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION I'M SUPER EXCITED TO HEAR THAT. I JUST WANTED IT ALSO JUST FOR THE RECORD SAY. THAT WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF TREES BURN OUT AND WHEN THEY DECAY THERE PUTTING UP NOTHING WHICH IS A POISONOUS GAS- WE CAN USE THOSE TO CREATE HYDROGEN WHICH IS A CLEAN FUEL SO. I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR LEGISLATION DAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. ON SOMETHING THAT'S SUPER EXCITING I THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ACTUALLY FINALLY BE MOVING FORWARD ON AN ENERGY THAT'S TRULY CLEAN- WHEN WE HAVE EXCESS ELECTRICITY TO MAKE IT SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO- WATCHING THIS BILL GO TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND GET SIGNED. SENATOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU I AM ALSO VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO COMMUTES BACK AND FORTH EVERY DAY GARCIA MY ELECTRIC CHARGE- BUT I GO TO AG LAND AND STILL SEE ALL KINDS OF- OPEN BURNS AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ALL KIND OF ORGANIC WASTE OUT IN OUR FIELD AND- BEING PRODUCED AT OUR DAIRIES AND EVERYWHERE ELSE AND IT'S ALREADY THERE WHEN I TOOK MY PRODUCING NEW IT IS THERE IT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH AND IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH IT IN A CLEAN WAY AND THEN WE JUST CONTINUE TO ADD TO THE TO THE WASTE. SO FOR ME THIS JUST HITS ALL I MEAN CREATING MORE ENERGY AND YOU AND WE CAN STORE IT ANOTHER HUGE ISSUE AND WE CAN ALSO USE WHAT'S ALREADY IN OUR ENVIRONMENT THAT WE USE- FOR ALL OTHER PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT SO I'M ALSO VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND LOVE. TO BE A CO AUTHOR WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT. SENATE HERTZBERG ONES. I DID. THINK MISTREATMENT. I JUST WANT TO PUT THIS DISCUSSION IN A LARGER CONTEXT FROM. MY EXPERIENCE IN LIFE AND YOU KNOW WE TRY IS HUMAN BEINGS TO COME UP WITH NEW WAYS. TO CREATE ENERGY VERY SORTS WHEN THE AUTOMOBILE WAS FIRST INTRODUCED FOR THE FIRST FOURTEEN YEARS 80% OF THE CARS WERE STEAM ENGINES. AND IT SHIFTED TO THIS INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FOR WHATEVER POLITICAL OR OTHER REASONS CERTAINLY WATER WAS A LOT CHEAPER THAN OIL AT THE TIME. AND WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR THE LAST MANY YEARS A SERIES OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THE ULTIMATE PERPETUAL ENERGY IN A BIGGER THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THE MALDIVES HAVE A RELIABLE ENERGY STANDARD PORTS FULLY INSTEAD OF A 100% BECAUSE THEY INTEGRATE ALL THEIR VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES. I AGREE WITH- THE COMMENT MADE EARLIER ABOUT BATTERIES. SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO I MEAN BATTERIES ARE HEAVY METAL THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO TO LANDFILLS THEY'VE GOT ALL SORTS OF CONSEQUENCES FOR. EVEN SOLAR EIGHT YEAR ENERGY PAY BACK ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO GO WITH NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS THERE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BELLY ACHE ABOUT. WHERE WE ARE BUT WE ARE AS A LEGISLATURE IS WE ALWAYS INVENTED WE CREATE COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS. THIS IS A FRAMEWORK LOOK AT ELECTROLYSIS WILL FURTHER REFINE THIS DEFINITION EVERYBODY'S AND THINGS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT I THINK IT'S GOING TO CREATE A LOT OF JOBS. I THINK IT'S GOING TO REALLY MOVE US TO A MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT APPROACH. TO ENERGY PRODUCTION AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED PACKAGE OF EVERYTHING WE DO THE ENERGY CRISIS THAT WE HAD. WAS NOT JUST A CRISIS ABOUT THE LIGHTS GOING OUT BUT WAS A CRISIS THAT A VERY SMALL GROUP OF COMPANIES HAD TOTAL CONTROL OVER OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION. AND WE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH WHETHER IT'S THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY POLAR. ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO DEAL WITH HOW TO CONVERT. OUR SOURCE OF ENERGY AND SO I THIS IS A VERY CREATIVE AREA THE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY. AND IT IS JUST ANOTHER STEP OF THE KIND OF APPROACH THAT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO TAKE IN THIS LEGISLATURE THIS GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO TAKE. TO INVENT THE FUTURE ASK FOR SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THANK YOU THE CENTER. BRADFORD DID YOU HAVE YOUR MAKE UP. THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANK YOU TO THE FOR BRINGING THE COMMENTS MEASURE BUT- I DO HAVE CONCERNS AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE ROLE THAT CAR WILL PLAY AND I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE CONCERNED BASED ON THE RECENT AUTHOR. OF CARBS IN ABILITY TO. REALLY MONITOR ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT THEY'VE BEEN TASKED WITH THE COME BACK WITH FEASIBLE WAYS OF. HOW TO BEST SPEND DOLLARS IN IT AND EVEN THE AUDIT SAYS. THEIR THEIR PRACTICES ARE INDEFENSIBLE AND TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW CAR TO DETERMINE WHAT'S BEST FOR LOW INCOME. OR MINORITY COMMUNITIES IS TOTALLY LAUGHABLE I ONLY WISH THERE WAS ANOTHER AGENCY WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SCOPING PLAN. AND COMING BACK WITH FEASIBLE PLANTS ARE REALLY ADDRESS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAINABLE BUT CARPETS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED. THEY'RE NOT THE AGENCY TO BE IN CHARGE OF THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE- CENTER CERTAIN. THANKS RICHER- APPRECIATE THE BILL AND GETTING OUT AHEAD OF THIS IF I THINK IS A REALLY SMART APPROACH JUST. GIVEN ALL THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN NEW ACTIVITY IN THIS ARENA I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT SOME GUARDRAILS IN PLACE- SO I THINK THE BILL SMART IN THAT WAY- I'M JUST HOPING THE AUTHOR CAN YOU JUST DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT I KNOW WOODY BIOMASS WAS BROUGHT UP BUT- THE CONCERNS RAISED BY- SOME OF THE TWEETERS. ABOUT SORT OF THE LIKE WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND THE VARIOUS FEEDSTOCKS SO I WOULD IMAGINE FOR INSTANCE A LIKE. WOODY BIOMASS TAKEN OUT OF OUR PROJECTS THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLY HARVESTED WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE OR- THAT THERE'S ACT BIOMASS FOR INSTANCE THAT WE YOU KNOW DIDN'T COMPLY WITH THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ALIKE JUST HOW TO. HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. EVEN ON THE DAIRY IN THE METHANE FRIEND I KNOW THAT'S A BIG ISSUE CAN YOU JUST TALK THROUGH. AND HE'S TRYING TO STAY HIGH LEVEL BUT HOW TO NAVIGATE ALL THE SORT OF ISSUES. THE CHAIR THEY HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. SO YOU KNOW THESE ARE IT'S LIKE SO MANY THINGS. DO WE LOOK TO ONE STATUTE. TO TAKE CARE OF ALL PROBLEMS NOT NECESSARILY. AND CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO ITS TAKES SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY PRACTICES. WE'RE GOING TO NEED. OUR EXISTING STATUTES ENFORCED. FOR BOARD POTENTIALLY NEW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HARVESTING MANAGING MAINTAINING OUR FOR SUSTAINABLY. AND TO BURDEN OUR DEFINITION OF GREEN HYDROGEN ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT PRACTICE WAS MET IT'S NOT A FAIR BURDEN. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. WHILE I APPRECIATE THERE'S A CONCERN THAT IF WE FOR EXAMPLE ALLOW FOR- WOODY BIOMASS GASIFICATION THAT THERE'S OTHER POLLUTANTS THAT COULD EMERGE. AND YES THAT IS POTENTIAL HOWEVER. HI TO CHEN HAS LEAGUE REDUCE POTENTIAL FOR SOME OF THE MOST NORTHERLY PROBLEMS WE HAVE LONG HILLS LONG HAUL TRUCKING. DIESEL POLLUTION IS NOT ONLY DETRIMENTAL FROM A CLIMATE PREVIEWS IT IS KILLING PEOPLE IT IS KILLING CALIFORNIANS NOW IT IS THE SINGLE LARGEST FOREIGN SOURCE OF SO MANY POLLUTANTS THAT ARE CREATING ALL KINDS OF HEALTH IMPACTS AND SO TO LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL FOR NOW I CERTAINLY DON'T AND I MY BILL DOESN'T ADVOCATE THAT WE CONVERT ALL LONG HAUL TRUCKS TO HYDROGEN THAT WAS PRODUCED USING FOSSIL FUELS NO THAT'S NOT SMART. HOWEVER IF WE ARE UTILIZING BIOMASS AND WHILE I WANT TO AVOID ANY OTHER POLLUTANTS AS A RESULT OF IT AND I THINK WE SHOULD NEED TO TIGHTEN UP RULES AROUND BIOMASS AND SUCH I DO NOT WANT TO EXCLUDE HYDROGEN FROM BIOMASS AND I THINK SOME OF AND I WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO MY COLLEAGUES AND ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO GET TO A MEETING OF THE MINDS. BUT I AM FAR MORE INTERESTED IN CUTTING OUT DIESEL AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT OTHER AND I'VE NOT YET HEARD OR SEEN OTHER TOOLS FOR DOING SO AND ELECTRIFICATION CAN ONLY GO SO FAR THERE SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT IN THE DEFINITIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO THAT WE DON'T GET SOME SO TIGHT THAT WE EXCLUDE IN OUR ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE THIS USE OF THIS RESOURCE AND A TRANSITION NERI WAY. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER. IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD CLOTHES. FOR YOUR LIFE GOING TO BE MY CLOTHES SO YEAH- BUT IF I COULD JUST ADD ON A FEW COMMENTS OF MY OWN BECAUSE I'M WORKING ON A- HYDROGEN BILL THAT I THINK WILL WORK TOGETHER WITH. A CENTER SKINNER'S HYDROGEN BILL BUT- GENERALLY MY BILL ALSO INCLUDES SOME PROVISIONS THAT WILL WILL ADDRESS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AS WELL BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES. A MISSIONS ARE LOCATED IN SOME OF- CALIFORNIA'S MOST UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND IF WE CAN CAPTURE. THOSE EMISSIONS TURN THAT INTO HYDROGEN- IN ESPECIALLY IN SOME FORMER. OF SUPERFUND SITES OR SOME FORMER- YOU KNOW FOSSIL FUEL. ENERGY PRODUCTION SITES IT WOULD BE A GOOD TRANSITION TO- CREATE JOBS AND ALSO CREATE RENEWABLE NATURAL POWER. FROM THE SOURCES SO THAT'S A BILL THAT WILL COME TO COMMITTEE LATER AND WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO FURTHER DISCUSS THIS. BUT WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SENATOR SKINNER ON THE DEFINITION TO MAKE SURE. THAT ACHIEVES THE GOALS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE STATE AS WELL SO.

MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SB TOOL FOR CODIFIES AND STANDARDIZES THE RULES FOR BASS INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS PIPP. I ACCEPT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS NOTED TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSISTHANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HER HELP. THE FILM IS AN EMERGENCY DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAM IT HELPS CONTRIBUTE TO THE GRID RELIABILITY WITH GENERATION CAPACITY BECOME SCARCE OR DURING TRANSMISSION EVENTS WHICH LIMITS. ACCESS TO SUPPLY. I'M SURE EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE REMEMBERS LAST SUMMER'S BLACKOUT. ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA CALLED ON RELIABILITY DEMAND RESPONSE WHICH IS MOSTLY THE BILL UP FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS TO HELP MANAGE THE EXTREME HEAT. ELECTRICITY USAGE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED DEMAND FOR AIR CONDITIONING. AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MEGAWATTS OF LOAD WAS SHED MOST OF THAT BY THE INDUSTRIAL COP CUSTOMERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE BILL. WITHOUT THE BILL OF THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR WOULD ENFORCE TO CALL MORE ROTATING OUT AGES WHICH WERE DESTROYED AND NEARLY A MILLION CALIFORNIANS IN OUR THE FED WITHOUT ELECTRICAL POWER. THE BILL WAS CALLED AGAIN IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY OVER THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND. FOR AS MUCH AS THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS AGAIN PREVENTING ROLLING BLACKOUTS BERMAN DANGER IN CALIFORNIA'S DURING ANOTHER EXTENDED HEAT STORM. THE BEST PERFORMANCE DURING THE AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER EVENTS PROVES ITS IMPORTANCE OF BENEFIT TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE. CALIFORNIANS EMERGENCY RELIABLE THE CHAT CHALLENGES DO NOT END OF THE SUBSIDENCE OF SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY HEAT STORMS EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. GREAT IMBALANCES AND OTHER CHALLENGES WILL CONTINUE. CAL WILL CONTINUE CALIFORNIA NEEDS CLEAN EMERGENCY RELIABILITY RESOURCES THERE'S NOTHING CLEANER. THAN AVOIDING CONSUMPTION. LET ME REPEAT THAT THERE IS NOTHING CLEANER THAN AVOIDING CONSUMPTION AT THE CPUC THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION DEVELOP PLANS TO AVOID A REPEAT OF LAST SUMMER'S ENERGY SOURCE. SUPPLY SHORTFALL IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT THE BILL BE AVAILABLE A RELIABLE SOURCE TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE LIGHTS STAY ON TO THAT END S. B. TWO OH FOUR PROTECTS PROMOTES AND PRESERVES RHYOLITIC RELIABILITY DEMAND RESPONSE BY ODIFYING THE BASE INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL REQUIRES A CPC TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER FOR TEA TO ENSURE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF DEMAND RESPONSE LOAD SHEDDING DURING GRADING VIRGIN SEES AND FINALLY THE BILL WOULD CREATE A PILOT ECONOMIC DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAM TO BE ADMINISTERED ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE'S TWO LARGEST ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS. SB TWO OR FOUR IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION WHOSE MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SHEDDING LOAD DURING GREAT EMERGENCIES LIKE LAST SUMMER.

THAT MEET THE GREAT NEED THE STATE CLIMATE NEEDS AND CUSTOMERS NEED. IT HAS WORKED CAN MEET THE GROUP NEEDS SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THAT CAN REDUCE DEMAND AND STABILIZE THE GRID NOT JUST DURING PEAK PERIODS ALL PERIOD. MOST PARTICIPANTS ARE HIGH LOAD FACTOR CUSTOMERS MEANING THEY DO NOT HAVE WHETHER SENSITIVE LOAD. IT IS AVAILABLE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR ON A COLD DAY IN FEBRUARY A MILD EVENING IN MAY AND DURING EXTREME HEAT WAVE. THAT STABILIZE THE GRID DURING BLACK ONE IF THE MEMBER AGENCIES AS WELL AS DURING LOCAL TRANSMISSION EMERGENCIES. STEP OFFICE OUR CLIMATE GOALS. HELPING TO KEEP EMISSIONS INTENSIVE TRADE EXPOSED TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA MAKING A GOOD PROVIDING THEIR SERVICES WITH CLEAN GREEN POWER. KEEPING INDUSTRY HERE AVOID EMISSIONS LEAKAGES THAT OCCUR WHEN MANUFACTURING LEAVES OUR GREAT STATE. BUT IT IS HARDER FOR THESE CUSTOMERS TO STAND CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW THE COST OF POWER HERE IS MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE NEIGHBORING STATE. FURTHER HELPS REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS WHEN IT'S CALLED BECAUSE IT AVOIDS THE DISPATCH OF GAS FIRED COMBUSTION TURBINES.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR- INTO THE COMMITTEE IS WELL FIRST OF ALL MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOUR FANTASTIC STAFF. FOR ALL OF THEIR ASSISTANCE OVER THESE PAST MANY WEEKS IN ADDITION WE'VE HAD A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT FROM PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS FROM ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS COMMUNICATION FROM CALIFORNIA'S TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS AND I SURE YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT THE COMMUNICATION THE CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE- IF YOU WOULD ALLOW THIS BILL TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE. IT'S THIS IS BEEN A FOCUS AREA FOR MANY OF US SINCE THE DEVASTATING FIRES A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR- DOLLY AT MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBER DIED FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP ON THIS BILL. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY ONE PROVIDES THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO CREATE BACKUP POWER RULES FOR CELL TOWERS MAINLINE OPERATIONS IN CABLE PHONE SYSTEMS HE AND IT MANDATES THAT THE STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES SHARES INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE ALREADY RECEIVING FROM TELECOM COMPANIES. ON NETWORK OUTAGES TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE REASON WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT IF YOU SEE WHO OVERSEES TELECOMS AND CREATES POLICY FOR TELECOMS DOESN'T HAVE THE STATUTORY ABILITY TO SEE THIS INFORMATION. THE STATE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES DOESN'T HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY. TO SHARE THE INFORMATION. NOW THIS IS WHY TO. DURING TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IS PRETTY TERRORIST BAKUL AT ITS PEAK NEARLY TWO MILLION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TWO MILLION HAVE THEIR LAND LINE. CELL PHONE AND CABLE SERVICE INTERRUPTED. OUR PHONES ARE LIFELINES IT'S HOW WE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. IN HOW WE RECEIVE EMERGENCY ALERTS. YET UP UNTIL LAST YEAR OUR CURRENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. IT'S NEVER BEEN MANDATED TO HAVE BACK UP POWER. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IN MANY IN THIS COMMITTEE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO MAKE SURE OUR OUR TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS. ARE MORE RESILIENT. IN THAT WE KNOW WHEN THEY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANTLY WHEN THEY'RE NOT WORKING. THE CPC IS% RECENTLY ADOPTED DECISIONS BACK IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY AND AGAIN IN FEBRUARY OF. THIS YEAR ORDERING TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP. COMPREHENSIVE RESILIENCY PLANS TO ENSURE THAT NETWORK FACILITIES ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS DURING A DISASTER POWER OUTAGE INCLUDING PS PS EVENTS FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS IN FIRE THREAT AREAS. IN ADDITION IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN VIA SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO SUBMIT AN OUTAGE NOTIFICATION. TO THE STATE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH THEN PASSES IT TO LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGERS WHENEVER AN OUTAGE OCCURS IN LIMITS THE ABILITY TO MAKE NINE ONE ONE CALLS. OR RECEIVE EMERGENCY ALERTS. THIS CRUCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING WHEN THERE'S BEEN A FAILURE IN THE NETWORK MAY ONLY BE SHARED CURRENTLY WITH LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS. IN THAT MAKES SENSE SO THOSE LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS KNOWS WHERE THOSE ENERGY STAR THAT PUT THE PUBLIC AT RISK IN WHEN THEY'RE OCCURRING BUT AGAIN. NONE OF THIS INFORMATION MAKES IT TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHO IS THE REGULATOR OF TELECOMS. THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES DOESN'T HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO SHARE THAT OUTAGE INFORMATION WITH THE CPUC. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION PC MUST RELY ON STAFF INITIATED DATA REQUESTS THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO LEARN ABOUT SOME FAILURES THAT ARE YET- YES HAD ALREADY BEEN NOTIFIED ABOUT. STILL SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT. A CLAIM THAT THE STAFF REQUESTS FROM THE PC ARE SUFFICIENT. BUT I WANT TO BE HONEST THEY'RE NOT. IN TAKE WEEKS WEEKS IF AT ALL THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION RECEIVES INFORMATION FROM TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES IN THIS BILL. IT WOULD BE AUTOMATIC ONE SO WE S. RECEIVES INFORMATION AND TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGE WHICH IS SIXTY MINUTES OF ADRS DISCOVERY THEY CAN THEN SEND ALONG TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY ONE WILL STRENGTHEN OUR TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRING THE- YES- TO SHARE OUT OF INFORMATION WITH TO SEE IF YOU SEE IT REQUIRES A PC TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN ACTION TAKEN. ON VARIOUS ADDITIVES. SECOND QUIT CLAIM I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF YOU DID THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO THROW OUT THE BRAND NEW BACKUP POWER RULES. THAT WERE RECENTLY ADOPTED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THAT COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. NUMBER ONE. THIS BILL PROVIDES THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE EXPLICIT EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO CREATE BACKUP POWER RULES FOR CELL TOWERS LAND LINE OPERATIONS IN CABLE PHONE SYSTEMS NUMBER TWO THE STRONG-BACKUP POWER RULES THAT EXIST TODAY TO SEE IF YOU SEE WOULD STAY IN PLACE. WOULD STAY IN PLACE AND BE UNAFFECTED BY THIS BILL. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE FURTHER CLARIFY THIS THANKS TO THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION WE'RE TAKING AMENDMENTS. TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY THAT IN AGAIN THIS IS A FACT I WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP FURTHER CLARIFIED THIS IN FUTURE AMENDMENTS IF THIS THERE THIS IS STILL A CONCERN. COMING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. NUMBER THREE. THIS BILL WILL ALSO HELP THE STATE IF TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY TO. EVER LITIGATE THESE RULES AT THE CPUC CHALLENGING THE FACT THAT THE PC HAS THE EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO ENACT BACKUP POWER RULES AND REGULATIONS. THIS BILL GIVES THEM THE EXPLICIT EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO DO SO. SB THREE FORTY ONE IS A COMMON SENSE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS IN THE CPUC ARE DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S NINE ONE ONE NETWORKS. IN TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO CRUCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUTAGES ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION STATE SHARES WILL COUNTY REPRESENT HIS CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CITIES JUST TO NAME A FEW. MISTER CHAIR WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WITH THIS DANCE THE FINAL HE'S FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CITY OF COSTA MESA. THEY WERE ALSO- HONORED TO HAVE CHORUSES IN THE WITH US FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I DON'T THINK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCHER FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT THANK YOU WILL GO FIRST TO- THE SPEAKERS SUPPORT DANIEL. THANKS TO FUNNEL IF HE IS ON THE PHONE. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON THAT YOU'RE HUESO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- APPRECIATE THE TIME TODAY MY NAME IS THE IT'S THE FINAL- AND I SERVICE THE FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CITY OF COSTA MESA SAY. AND ALSO SERVICE THE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TODAY- THE DISASTERS AND POWER SHUT OFFS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE EMERGENCY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. NEED TO BE IMPROVED BOTH RESIDENTS AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY ONE WILL IMPROVE OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS BY CREATING STRONGER OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION. PROVIDERS AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHEN IT COMES TO TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGES AND BACK UP POWER SYSTEMS. WHAT WE LOOK TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY FIRESTORMS INCLUDING THE TUBBS FIRE IN SANTA ROSA. OR THE THOMAS FIRE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OR THE DEVASTATING MUD AND DEBRIS DEBRIS FLOWS THAT FOLLOWED IT MINUS ITO- IN EARLY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE CAN REFERENCE THE CAMPFIRE LEADER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- OR THE WALLS HE FIRED IT STARTED LATER THAT DAY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. JUST JUST PROVIDING ALL VIVID EXAMPLES TO DEMONSTRATE GETTING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SAFELY EVACUATED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF A DISASTER CLEARLY ELEVATES THE DEFINE. THE DEFINING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE OR DEATH. AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND OUR RESIDENTS NEEDED AT OF COME TO EXPECT AND RIGHT WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT OUR PHONES WORK WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. IN ADDITION IT IS CENTER REQUIRE A ARTICULATED DURING THE POWER OUTAGES IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. WITH NEARLY TWO MILLION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENCE- HAD A LOT THEIR LAND LINE CELL PHONE THE CABLE SERVICE INTERRUPTED- ANOTHER NOTABLE ITEMS. KEEPING IN PERSPECTIVE IT SMALLER ENERGY IS OBVIOUSLY IF. OCCURRED IN WITHIN THE COMMUNICATION SEAT SYSTEM. BUT THE C. P. CPUC HAS NO IDEA WHEN THEY ARE OCCURRING THAT COMES BACK TO THE SHARING OF INFORMATION. THE CPUC REGULATES THE TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS AND REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE BACK UP POWER BUT IF TELCOS REPORT OUTAGES TO THEIR NETWORKS TO- YES THE CPUS HE IS UNABLE TO FIND OUT OF THAT HOW DID YOU ACTUALLY. HEARD SB THREE FORTY ONE WILL RECTIFY THIS AND WE'LL PROVE OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. SB THREE FORTY ONE REQUIRES- YES TO SHARE COMMUNITY ISOLATION OUTAGE INFORMATION WITH THE CPUC AND REQUIRES THE CPUC TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ACTION TAKEN. USING THE COMMUNITY ISOLATION OUTAGE INFORMATION. IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY ONE. THANK YOU NOW WILL GO TO CHORUSES A LOAF WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY CELLS ARE LOOKING ON BEHALF F THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. HAVING ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT NINE ONE ONE MARRIAGES IS VITAL NOT ONLY TO THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRST RESPONDERS. BOLSTERING OUTAGE MAP REQUIREMENTS WILL MAKE THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION MORE ACCESSIBLE. AND WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY ENSURING TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE HAS APPROPRIATE BACKUP ELECTRICAL SUPPLY. TO ADDRESS OUTAGES IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE CONSUMERS CAN COMMUNICATE. ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF DISASTER. AND FIRST RESPONDERS ARE NOT IMPEDED FROM DOING THEIR VITAL WORK. SB THREE FORTY ONE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HELLO YES. TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT BACKUP COLLECTIBLE SUPPLIES RULES SUPPLY RULES. FOR THESE REASONS CSSA IS PLEASED. TO SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY ONE.

THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE OVER TO SPEAKERS AND OPPOSITION WE HAVE ONE LEAD OPPOSITION SPEAKER STEVE CARLSON. WITH CITY AREAS MISTER CARLSON ONLINE. I AM MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO THINK MY COLLEAGUE BERNIE OROZCO MIGHT BE IN THE GALLERY- ONCOR'S CCPA BUT- HEY I RESPECTFULLY. OKAY WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THAT CENTER MCGUIRE OVER THE YEARS ON THE ON THE LATEST LEGISLATION- WE UNFORTUNATELY I BELIEVE THIS IS UNNECESSARY AND DUPLICATE DUPLICATIVE IN A AND A COUPLE OF WAYS- SB SIX SEVENTY THAT THE- CENTER MENTIONED WAS HIS BILL THAT WE HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY ON WE'RE WORKING NOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- BOND REGULATIONS. THOSE REGULATIONS ARE NOT EVEN FINAL YET THERE'S ANOTHER PROVISION OF THE BILL- THAT WILL REQUIRE ANOTHER REAL MAKING- IN TERMS REQUIRING MASSIVE OUTAGES AND REQUIRES EACH TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER TO MAINTAIN THAT MAP. THOSE ARE NOT REAL TIME MAPS AND WE KIND OF QUESTION WHAT THE VALUE OF THOSE- WILL BE GOING FORWARD. ON THE ISSUE OF THE- PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- THE INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED TO THE CALIFORNIA. BOB HERTZBERG D. SERVICES IS A REAL TIME EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION ON SITUATIONAL AWARENESS THAT IS NOT THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHO ARE ASKING ARE ARE AT OUR MEMBERS FOR THAT INFORMATION SO UP WE DON'T THINK THERE IS. THAT IT'S NOT AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON. LASHLEY AS THE THAT CENTER IN. THE PEWS HAS ALL- ENACTED- RULES ON SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACKUP POWER IN TIER TWO AND TIER THREE HI THREAT FIRE AREAS- THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL DOES NOT IS NOT LIMITED TO TIER TWO AND TIER THREE HIGH FIRE AREAS. AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS MIGHT YOU KNOW EXPAND THINGS MIGHT EVEN CAUSE THEM TO HAVE TO OPEN UP A NEW- EIGHT A NEW PROCEEDING. WELL WE WOULD HOPE ON THIS ISSUE THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER- TO STREAMLINE THE- ROSS SAYS TO GET TO POWER ON SITE THEY KNOW THE SENATOR- HAS HEARD THAT WE'VE HAD DIFFICULTY IN GETTING PERMITS OR- THE VERY BACK OF POWER THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR- ON ON THE SITE. AND TO AND TO LOOK FOR- OTHER WAYS TO EXPAND INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WILL- MILITATE AGAINST OUTAGES BUT THAT FOR THOSE REASONS WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE- WITH THE SENATOR BUT THAT RIGHT NOW WE A- BUNCH RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU BERNIE DID YOU WANT. YES I MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION- WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING MISTER CARLSON HAS JUST SAID. JUST FOR THE RECORD. THE P. YOU SEE ONLY FOUR WEEKS AGO FEBRUARY ELEVENTH SUGGESTS ADOPTED THOSE SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF BACKUP POWER REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS. SO WITHIN EIGHT MONTHS OF THAT DECISION FEBRUARY ELEVENTH WE HAVE TO HAVE IN PLACE. AT EVERY NODE THAT SERVES A CRITICAL FACILITY. OR A CELL TOWER OR A CRITICAL NETWORK THAT DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A WIRELESS SERVICE. BACK UP POWER. NOW THIS BACKUP POWER REQUIREMENTS. AS I SAID IT MUST BE WITHIN EIGHT MONTHS OF THAT DECISION WERE ALREADY MONEY ONE MONTH AND- AND THESE BACKUP POWER- THIS IS LIKE A HUGE BACK UP DIESEL GENERATORS SENATOR SKINNER. MENTIONED EARLIER THAT SHE IS NOT A BIG SUPPORTER OF DIESEL GENERATION WELL IT JUST AS AN EXAMPLE AROUND LAKE COUNTY FOR MEDIACOM. MEDIACOM WILL HAVE TO INSTALL A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BACK UP DIESEL GENERATORS JUST AROUND THE COUNTY THIS IS IN A CLEARLY. SO THIS IS A HUGE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT FOR OUR INDUSTRY SO WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF THIS DECISION. EVERY CUSTOMER WITH ANY TIER TWO AND TIER THREE FIRE THREAT DISTRICT. MUST ALSO HAVE BACKUP GENERATION SO. THE BACKUP DIESEL GENERATORS WILL BE THE FIRST QUICK RESPONSE- BEYOND THAT WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO PUT A THREE LARGE REFRIGERATOR SIZED. CABINETS NEAR A NOTE SO LORD FORBID THAT YOU HAVE A NOTE ON YOUR PROPERTY ON YOUR LONG BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET- BECAUSE SEVEN TWO HOURS IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF BACKUP POWER- SO. THIS IS A VERY HUGE ISSUE FOR US A HUGE INVESTMENT. IF THE BILL WERE TO BE HELPFUL THE THING THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR IS. SOME ASSISTANCE IN GETTING THOSE PERMITS FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO A HUNDRED TWENTY BACK UP DIESEL GENERATORS AND LAKE COUNTY AROUND CLEAR LAKE IT'S GOING TO BE HUGE TASK- THE CABLE INDUSTRY HAS FIFTY THOUSAND GENERATORS STATEWIDE. SO THIS IS A VERY LARGE NUMBER THE LANGUAGE. IN THE BILL THAT SAYS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A NEW PROCEED. I GET CONFUSED ABOUT BECAUSE THIS DECISION IS ALREDY OUT- IF YOU WERE TO CODIFY SOMETHING IN STATUTE. IN MY OPINION NOT SEEN THE LANGUAGE YOU MAY BE TYING THE HANDS OF THE P. YOU- READ NEEDS DID BUILDING TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE. OUR EFFORTS ARE GOING TO BE. AS SUCCESSFUL TO GET THOSE PERMITS AND SO THE PC MAY HAVE TO COME BACK AND RE OPEN THAT. AND ALL THE OTHER REASONS THAT MISTER CARLSON ALSO DESCRIBED OUT IS MAPS- THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE THE CALLOW YES IS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE- AND PROTECTED BY HOMELAND SECURITY. NGUYEN SB SIX SEVENTY WENT THROUGH IN TWENTY NINETEEN BECAME OPERATIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY. IT SAYS IN STATURE THAT THAT INFORMAION IS CONFIDENTIAL THEN TO TURN AROUND AND TO SHARE IT WITH THE P. YOU SEE. IT'S TO GROUNDWORK FOR THEIR PURPOSES THE PC AND THE RECENT DECISION. HAS SAID THAT THEY WANT FROM COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO RESOURCES- THE RESOURCE PLAN FOR THE RESILIENCY SO WE WILL HAVE TO GIVEN THE DETAIL THAT THAT NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ATTITUDES. FOR ALL THESE REASONS FOR YOUR OPPOSE BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP US. IN THIS ENDEAVOR WE WOULD ENCOURAGE SOME LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PROVIDE. EASIER ACCESS TO- LOCAL CITING PERMITS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'LL GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE. MODERATOR PLEASE Q. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. OF SP. THREE FORTY ONE. THANK YOU AGAIN THOSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AND OUR FIRST PERSON IS LINE NINETY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. LATE SO ALL WE HAVE A FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE WITH THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT BIGGER IN A POSITION. THANK YOU AND THAT COMES FROM A LINE NINETY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE IN MEMBERS- THIS IS YOUR LONG DEPEND SAID REPRESENTING CAL CALM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION- BUT LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORED BY OFFICE AND HIS STAFF THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WEEK OR IN A POSITION. THANK YOU AND THAT'S LINE SIXTY SEVEN. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE YOUNG WOMEN ON BEHALF OF CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS IN OPPOSITION. THIS MODERATOR OTHER ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. WELCOME TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANYONE- CENTER BRADFORD. FOLLOWED BY CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ONCE AGAIN I STAND WHAT CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THIS MEASURE- IT'S NO ARGUMENT THAT. THIS IS US A CLEARLY ARTICULATED WE NEED TO BE IN COMMUNICATION WITH OUR COMMUNICATION WORLD AND SO WE LIVE AND DIE BY OUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE BUT- ONCE AGAIN WE'RE ASKING CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT LIVE IN TIER ONE TIER TWO OR TIER THREE. THE BEAR THE COST OF THIS BACK UP GENERATION WHICH AGAIN IS TOTALLY UNFAIR TO BE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY- THESE PSP POWER INTERRUPTIONS- NO ONE IN L. A. COUNTY WELL I SHOULD SAY NO ONE AND ONLY CALLING BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE URBAN AREAS IN L. A. COUNTY OR ANY OF THE URBAN. COMMUNITIES OR WILL BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THESE WILDFIRES SO TO ASK THEM TO BEAR THE COST OF BACKUP GENERATION IS TOTALLY UNFAIR AGAIN AS INDIVIDUAL WHO SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE TELEPHONY SPACE. THE REAL ISSUE WHEN I HEAR LAN LINES WHICH ARE BEING INCLUDED IN THIS IT'S ALMOST LAUGHABLE BECAUSE THE REAL ISSUE WITH LANDLINES ARE VERY RARELY DO GLAM LIGHTS GO OUT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF POWER. THEY GO OUT BECAUSE OF POOR MAINTAIN MAINTENANCE AND. MAINTAINING THE COPPER WATER. JUST TEN YEARS WHEN I SERVICE HERE UTILITY. ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE WE HAD A MASSIVE RAINSTORMS. AND L. A. COUNTY. IN DURING THEIR RATING STORM. ALMOST A HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. LOST ELEVEN HE HAD NOTHING TO DO OF WILDFIRES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH POWER SHORTAGES HE HAD TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WASN'T MAINTAINED. AND THE C. LACKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LIKE FRONTIER WERE. UNABLE TO PROVIDE WILL FRONTIER IS NOT A PART OF THAT. PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMER AND AGAIN IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH POWER OUTAGES SO THE CONTINUE TO ADD LAN LINES AS TO. PART OF THIS REASON FOR BACK UP POWER IS DISINGENUOUS AN ARGUMENT IN AND OF ITSELF- SO. I WOULD ASKED AGAIN THAT WE ASK THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY FAR OUTAGES. I MEAN BY FIRES IN IN EXPERIENCE A POWER OUTAGE JUST THE BEAR THE COST OF THIS. THAT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR. THIRD OF THAT COST PROBABLY 25% OF THAT COST WOULD BE A BETTER INVESTMENT TO IMPROVE THE COPPER WIRE. INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER- SERVICE RELIABILITY FOR THOSE LANDLINE CUSTOMERS. THANK YOU DO CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. SURE THIS YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION AND YOU RECENTLY PASSED A BILL IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN S. B. SIX SEVENTY IN THE C. P. C. THE CQC RECENTLY ADDRESSED A BACKUP POWER REGULATIONS FOR COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS GIVEN THAT THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO REQUIRE DEPLOYMENT OF BACK UP GENERATORS AND BACKUP POWER FOR CAN YOU- COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS CAN YOU PLEASE EXPAND ON WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY- AND I ONLY ASK THAT BECAUSE I DON'T- I DON'T THINK THAT WITH THE CPUC WAS REQUIRED TO DO IN YOUR PREVIOUS LEGISLATION. HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED OR EVALUATED SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AT THIS TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH A COUPLE CLARIFICATIONS NUMBER ONE- WE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR THAT WOULD REQUIRE SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACKUP. IT WAS KILLED IN THE ASSEMBLY. SO I JUST WANNA BE VERY CLEAR THAT WE ADVANCE THE BILL IN SO WHERE THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE COMING FROM WHETHER THEY ARE LAND LINE OR THEIR CELL PHONE. FOR COMING FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. JULY WHAT IS THE CELL PHONE. REGULATION OF THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS. FEBRUARY THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION IS NOW REQUIRING SEVEN TWO HOUR BACKUP FOR LANDLINE. NOW THE REASON WHY THEY'RE DOING THAT NUMBER ONE. LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL IF YOU WILL TELECOMS ARE GOING FROM COPPER TO FIBRE WHICH THEN REQUIRES POWER BACK UP. IN WHAT WE ALSO SIGNED TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WAS PLAN LINE EVEN THE TRADITIONAL LOST POWER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS YEAH THAT WAS A SUSTAIN AN OUTAGE- BASED OFF OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. SO UNDER SIX SEVENTY THAT INFORMATION GOES TO THE STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. THE STATE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES DOESN'T HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO SHARE% THE INFORMATION TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. OF ANY PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHO IS THE REGULATOR FOR TELECOM DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO I REQUEST THAT INFORMATION SAID THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. NOW THE OTHER PC'S WHEN IT COMES TO PASS WHEN IT COMES TO OUTAGES FOR ESPECIALLY. OUT FIBER IN CELL IT COULD HAPPEN IN MANY WAYS SO LIVE IN A VERY RURAL PART OF CALIFORNIA. FIVE YEARS AGO. A SEMI TRUCK. TOOK DOWN A FEW OVERHEAD FIBER WIRE. THAT KNOCKED DOWN ALL TELECOMMUNICATION FROM WILLITS. ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH ARCADA FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS YOU CAN GET MONEY OUT OF THE BANK YOU CAN SWIPE YOUR CARD AT SAFEWAY. EXCEPT FOR SO THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT POWER BUT THIS IS WHEN IT COMES TO ANY OTHER TYPE OF NATURAL DISASTER IN THESE OUTRAGE MOUNTS ARE CRITICAL IF YOU LIVE IN THE SERVICE OF THE CALIFORNIA EDISON TERRITORY YOU LIVE IN P. JEANNIE. YOU EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A REAL TIME OUTAGE MAPS AND THIS WOULD HELP THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION AS WELL AS TELECOM. TO PASS TO BE ABLE TO THESE OUTAGE MAPS IS WELL. THE OTHER PIECE THAT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY. IS THAT. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK TODAY. NEXT TO THE CHAIR AND HIS INCREDIBLE STAFF CLARIFY THAT WE'RE NOT SEEKING ANY NEW PROCEEDINGS. BECAUSE THAT'S THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT TO DO SO THE AMENDMENTS ARE IN THE BILL ALL RIGHT TO SAY THAT WE ARE NOT REQUESTING ANY NEW PROCEEDINGS I AM HERE TODAY TO TELL EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. IF YOU NEED US TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY THAT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION I'D BE HAPPY TO DO SO BECAUSE THAT IS NOT OUR INTENT ABOUT AND I'M HERE TO STATE ON THE RECORD THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE WE THINK BUT- THE CHAIR IS DON. CLARIFIES THAT BUT HAPPY SO THE LAST PIECE OF CITIES IS ON CONFIDENTIALITY. UNDER PUBLIC UTILITIES RULE FIVE EIGHTY THREE. HI ANY INFORMATION THAT IS SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. IS NOT P. ARE ABLE EIGHT ISN'T SUBJECT TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IT'S CONFIDENTIAL. SO I KNOW THAT SOME MAY SAY THAT THERE MAY BE AN ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE A TO SEE THIS INFORMATION IT'S NOT YOU CAN'T ESTIMATE OF PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST IT'S ALREADY IN STATUTE. BUT IN THE BILL ONLY BE HAPPY TO CLARIFY THAT FURTHER AS WELL THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU MISTER CARLSON. MISTER CARLSON HAS LITERALLY FOR THE PAST YEAR AT FROM CTIA BEEN ON A CALL MISS REQUIRE OKAY JUST MAKE THOSE COMMENTS I SUPPOSE THE STATEMENTS MEASURES FOR THE I JUST WANTED TO ASK FOR- I JUST. FEDERAL AGENTS QUESTIONS DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATE OVER ELABORATE ANSWER ON THOSE QUESTIONS AND OTHERS I JUST HAVE ONE MORE THAN DO YOU HAVE A CONCERN AT ALL THAT EXPANDING- FOLLOWING UP ON MY A QUESTION FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM- DENIED DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR DO YOU HAVE A CONCERN AT ALL. THAT YOU KNOW REQUIRING THIS STATE WIDE VERSUS JUST IN TIER ONE TWO AND THREE AT HIGH FIRED THREAT DISTRICTS THAT THAT MIGHT TAKE AWAY FROM THESE HIGH MOST HIGH RISK. AREAS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE. I AM THOSE. OVER ALL WE CAN. OUR BILL WAS MY MORE. AT RISK. IN STRATEGIC LAST YEAR IN REGARDS TO- WHAT WOULD BE IN- THE OUTAGE MAPS BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. THIS BILL WE AREN'T SEEKING THEM. TO GO BEYOND TIER ONE THAT'S IT. THE ONLY LOOKING- IT NOT TO GO BEYOND TIER ONE. CENTER GROVE DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER NO MAKE YOU MISTER TERRY APPRECIATE KEPT THANK ASK QUESTIONS WILL GO TO CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY- AS IT PERTAINS TO- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED EMPIRE YEARS BUT I JUST HAVE A MEDICAL A CONCERN BUT RATHER IF THE AUTHOR WOULD ADDRESS IT- THE PREVIOUS- I THINK HE WAS OPPOSING NOT. STATED SOME CONCERNS AS IT PERTAINS TO PERMITS FROM LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND YOU KNOW COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AYE. I KNOW THEY'LL BE SOME CHALLENGES- HAVE THERE BEEN DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE CAN HELP LOCAL. MUNICIPALITIES EXPEDITE PERMITS OR OR PERHAPS FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO HELP. IN THAT REGARD. SO THROUGH THE CHAIR- CENTER RUBIO IS A CO CHAIR OF THE WILDFIRE WORKING GROUP. THERE WAS A BILL THAT THE STATE ADVANCED- AND I WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO HELP EXPEDITE. THOSE GENERATORS I THINK IT'S CRITICAL- I DO THIS IS A SENATOR DODD ALSO PART OF IT I THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE GROUP BUT I THINK MAJORITY MEMBERS WOULD HAVE. A CONSENSUS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE HAD A VERY SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR ON THAT I BELIEVE IT WAS AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY ONE. THAT WOULD EXPEDITE THOSE- THE GENERATORS THAT WE BE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY ON ACTS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. PRETTY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. WE HAVE A MOTION ON SPILL THE MOTION WOULD BE TO. PASS THIS BILL. AND ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY. MCNICHOLAS SENATE MCGUIRE MENTIONED HE IS TAKING THE- AMENDMENTS JUST WANT TO CLARIFY YOUR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS LOWS IN THE COMMITTEE CENTER MCGUIRE.

THE BILL IS OUT WILL- KEEP THE ROLE PERHAPS OF MEMBERS AND WE'LL MOVE ON NOW TO ITEM NUMBER SIX S. B. TO ENERGY PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS ON NON HEAVY NON ENERGY BENEFITS. SIR BECKER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY WHO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. SB THREE FORTY FIVE WILL DRIVE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SHOULD BE DID ENERGY INVESTMENTS THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE MOST NEED. FOR THE STARKLY BEEN LEFT OUT. EVERY YEAR THE CPUC OVERSEES SPENDING CLOSE TO BILLION DOLLARS FROM PUBLIC PURPOSE CHARGES ON UTILITY BILLS. PROVIDING PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SHOULD BE SOLAR ENERGY STORAGE ETCETERA. BUT IT CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THAT LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE LAGGING BEHIND IN ADOPTING DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. DECIDING WHICH PROJECTS TO FUND THE CBC USUALLY USES A COST EFFECTIVENESS TEST THE CONSIDERS ONLY THE BENEFITS OF THE GRID SUCH AS AVOIDING THE NEED TO BUILD MORE TRANSMISSION CAPACITY. THESE YOU DO NOT CONSIDER NON ENERGY BENEFITS LIKE LOWER BILLS ARE PROVED AIR QUALITY. WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACTS QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. WE SOULD BE AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THESE PUBLIC PERCIFORMES TO MAXIMIZE THE TOTAL BENEFITS. ESPECIALLY IN TO HELP COMMUNITIES WITH THE LEAST ABILITY TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO CLEANER ENERGY. ON THEIR OWN. THE BILL CAME DIRECTLY FROM RECOMMENDATIONS SB THREE FIFTY REPORT REDUCING BARRIERS TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND ACCESSING. THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAS A STRONG PITCH FOR THE ANALYSIS I THINK THAT YOUR OTHER STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING HERE DOES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT RATES. DOES NOT INADVERTENTLY TIE THE PUC'S HANDS TRIMMING THE BENEFITS. OF COST EFFECTIVENESS AND SHOULD BE GENERATION GOING FORWARD. AB THESE MOMENTS MAKE THE STRONGER AND BETTER ALIGNED ON ENERGY BENEFITS WITH THE BILL'S ORIGINAL INTENT. ESPECIALLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE BY TO ASSIST ANY BY THE PHONE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. WE'LL GO TO WITNESSES NOW WE HAVE A MATCH THEY KNOW THE GREEN LINE IN INSTITUTE IF THAT- THE FIRM. HELLO YES. GOD SPEAKS WONDERFUL. GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTRACT THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER FOR OFFERING SB THREE FORTY FIVE AND CHAMPIONING ENERGY JUSTICE MY NAME IS MATT CANO AND I AM THE ENERGY EQUITY SENIOR LEGAL COUNSEL WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE OF RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE NONPROFIT IN OAKLAND ARMS OF THIS LEGISLATION I'M HERE TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT SB THIRTY THREE POINT FIVE I HEARD YOUR SUPPORT TO THE FOLLOWING THREE REASONS ONE SB THREE FORTY FIVE HEALTH INSURER THE VALUE AND SERVE THE INTERESTS OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

I HAVE WORKED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER AND I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN ONE I'VE FIRSTHAND THAT FOR FAR TOO LONG OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND OVERLOOKED BY BOTH THE TPC AND THE THING YOU SEE PEOPLE MOBILE COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE AFFORDABLE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY INVESTMENTS BAKER BURKE. FAMILIES ARE DEALING WITH THE REAL LIFE CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT HAD AN EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ENERGY COST SAVINGS PROGRAM MANY LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO USE COCAINE WHICH IS VERY EXPENIVE OTHERS ARE DEALING WITH HIGH ELECTRIC BILL BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO UPGRADE THEIR APPLIANCES OR. MAKE THEIR HOME MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT. HE FAMILIES AVOID USING. BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TO RUN HEATER WHICH MEANS CHILDREN GO TO BED COLD NIGHT AND ALL. END UP GETTING SICK AND MISSING SCHOOL. OFTEN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS RELY ON BURNING WOOD TO KEEP WARM DURING THE WINTER ADDING TO AIR POLLUTION AND MAKING IT HARD TO BREATHE FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS. AZIMUTHALLY AND OTHER RESPIRATORY DISEASES ARE PREVALENT IN THESE COMMUNITIES. EMILY IS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST YES THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD MAKE CLEAN ENERGY MORE AFFORDABLE. SB THREE FORTY FIVE WILSHIRE THAT SITUATIONS LIKE% THE ONES THAT I MENTIONED AND OTHERS ARE NO LONGER IGNORED IT WILL ENSURE THAT THESE POTENTIALLY LIFE CHANGING NON ENERGY BENEFITS ARE CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING WHO HAS ACCESS TO ENERGY PROGRAMS.

BUT CONCLUDES OUR SPEAKERS ARE FROM THE PUBLIC WILL COME TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS NOW. ANYONE WISHING TO COMMENT- CENTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AGAIN I HAVE TO RISE IN JUST STATE MY CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO WHAT SOUNDS TO BE COMMONSENSE POLICY BUT VERY RARELY DOES IT REALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES AND INTENT TO CONTINUE TO SAY THAT LOW INCOME FOLKS- ONE SOLAR IS FAR FROM THE TRUTH BECAUSE MANY OF THEM CAN'T AFFORD. AND WIND SOLAR IS OFFERED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IT'S NOT TO SELL IT IT'S TO LEASE IT TO THEM OR THEY DON'T BENEFIT FROM THE TAX CREDITS AREN'T ANY OF THE REBATE WHAT FOLKS WANT IS AFFORDABLE ACTRESSES THE TURN WHEN THEY TURN ON THEIR WORKS AND THEY CAN AFFORD IT THEY WANT RELIABILITY. AND YOU KNOW THE AND THAT'S THE CRUX OF WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS YEAR TO BUT TO CONTINUE TO SAY BUT BEFORE YOU CAN STILL I INDIVIDUAL A SOLAR SYSTEM WHETHER THEY'RE LOW INCOME OR HIGH INCOME YOU GOT TO FIRST THROUGH THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SITUATION AND I'VE TALKED TO TOO MANY FOLKS WHO HAD SOLAR COMPANIES COME TO THEIR HOUSE WITHOUT FIRST TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IS ASIAN YOU HAVE TO SEAL THE UNIT BEFORE YOU CAN SIZE- A SOLAR SYSTEM. AND FAR TOO OFTEN THAT IS NOT HAPPENING IN IN THE PRESENTATION ADMITTED ENERGY EFFICIENCY BACK TO BE NUMBER ONE ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS MAKING SURE THAT THE PLACE THAT THEY LIVE IN IS- SEALED PROPERLY SO THERE'S NO HEAT LOSS OR NO COOLEY LOSS- WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING THEIR UTILITIES AND- MANY OF THESE SO CALLED LOW INCOME FOLKS DON'T OWN THEIR HOME SO THEY'RE NOT IN POSITION ANYWAY TO PUT SOLAR ON THEIR HOMES SO I JUST WISH. POOR FOLKS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE NOT SYNONYMOUS ARE QUICK BEING USED AS A POSTER CHILD FOR WHY MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE NEEDED WHEN THEY RARELY I SEE THE BENEFIT OF ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS AND AGAIN I WILL- LEAN BACK ON THE CAR BOUGHT IT THEY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT ALL THE DAILY ALLOCATED FOR AS FAR AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY ON WALL RENEWABLE ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE REDUCTIONS- I HAVE. VERY RARELY- EVER. HE MET THE GOAL AND IT THAT THEY CLAIM TO. THEY CAN'T DOCTOR AND WE CONTINUE AGAIN TO SAY- IT'S BENEFITING POOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN A VERY VERY. REACHES THEIR COMMUNITIES SO I'LL STAND ON THAT. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD OF ANYONE ELSE- CENTER DOT. YEAH I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT CENTER BRADFORD AUDIO ON THIS A VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPPOSITION- AND THE POTENTIAL COSTS TO- INCREASES TO RATEPAYERS- THAT SAID I BELIEVE THAT THE- AUTHOR- THIS FIRST. YEAR BUILDING FOR THIS COMMITTEE IS- REALLY SHOWN A GREAT PROPENSITY TO- AT THE TOP TO THE- TALK TO THE- THE OPPONENTS. AND I'VE SEE THAT THEIR- WILLING TO GIVE HIM A SHOT LOOK AT THOSE MEMBERS SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT RESERVE THE RIGHT. TO OPPOSE ON THE FLOOR IF NECESSARY AND THOSE MEMBERS- ARE NOT- SATISFACTORY SO I APPRECIATE THE OFFERS COOPERATION ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD AND YES WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR THE AUTHOR IS BEEN REALLY REALLY GOOD TO WORK WITH. ON ON A- ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AND I THINK PARTIALLY AMENDMENTS WOULD DO THAT SO I THINK. THEY'LL BE A DIFFERENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE NEXT HEARING. AND OF COURSE THIS. A BILL. BOB WOULD BE REFERRED TO APPROPRIATIONS WHERE WOULD HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ANOTHER HEARING THE WILL GO TO A CENTER BAKER MY CLOSING COMMENTS THERE'S NO OTHER ALL WE HAVE CENTER RUBIO. ATTENTION THAT CENTER BOARD JUST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I ALSO WANT TO JUST EXPRESS THAT- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME AMENDMENTS THAT CAME. AT THE LAST MINUTE BUT I DID HAVE CONCERNS AND- WE'RE GONNA. GET THE UP TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT I THINK EVERYONE EXPRESSED. BUT I ALSO WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF A LITTLE MORE WITH THE CENTER FROM GARDENA TODAY AND THAT. YOU KNOW MINORITY GROUPS AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE USUALLY USED AS A PERTAINS TO. THE BENEFITS BUT- I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT HARDLY EVER SEE SOME OF THESE BENEFITS SO. I WANT TO START THINKING IN A IN A MUCH BROADER WAY HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT IT. DOES GET TO THESE COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO FOR JUST COMMON YOU KNOW ALL OF US COULD NOT GO THROUGH OUR DISTRICT OFFICES TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS ELIGIBLE TO THE LOWEST INCOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE'S A WEATHER IS ATION PROGRAM THAT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS. AND WE HAVE A CONTRACTORS NETWORK IS PRETTY LARGE IN TERMS OF. ITS AVAILABILITY TO BRING SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE COMMUNITIES I OFFER ALSO. ENCOURAGE ARE SENATE OFFICES WORKING THROUGH LOCAL NONPROFITS TO COMMUTE BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE. BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE UP PROGRAMS ARE UNDER SUBSCRIBER I'M WORKING ON A BILL ON WEATHER IS ATION THAT'LL EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO MORE WEATHER IS ATION ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE IT'S HARDER. AND HARDER TO AFFORD A HOME THE CALIFORNIA MUCH MUCH LESS MAKE THESE. FOR EXPENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS AND WE HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT INCREASING. THE POOL OF FUNDS THEY'RE ALREADY AVAILABLE WOULD JUST INCREASE ELIGIBILITY AND HELP. MAKE MORE WITH THAT MAKE SURE WHETHER THEY SHOULD MORE VILLAGE WANDER THROUGH THE LITTLE PLUG IN THERE BECAUSE- THIS BILL IS ALSO COMING TO THIS COMMITTEE AND A CAR SEAT WORKS REALLY WELL. WITH. CENTER BACKERS BILL. ON THE CERES AND THIS AREA I HOPE THAT WE CAN. ADVANCE BY HIS BILL- SO BORJA DID YOU WANT ALSO MAKE. AND THEN WE HAVE CENTER HERTZBERG. I WANT TO COMMEND THE OF THE CENTER FOR MENLO PARK- I ANTICIPATED THAT. WE WOULD HAVE SOME PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES ON ON THIS ISSUE IN MY UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN. SOME SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS- I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION BUT- I THINK YOU'RE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB ENGAGING WITH FOLKS ON THIS ISSUE- ON. I'LL PROBABLY REMAIN AND NO FOR TODAY BUT- I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANOTHER BITE AT THIS- INOPPORTUNE TO BETTER APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS. THAT COULD VERY WELL CHANGE BUT FOR RIGHT NOW JUST ONE JUST LET YOU KNOW. I RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BUT I'M GONNA. BE RESPECTFUL OPPONENT JUST FOR TODAY THOUGH AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR WORK. THANK YOU. TEN HERTZBERG. I JUST WANT TO SHAKE MY CAUGHT MY THE POSITION THAT OF SENATOR DODD OF THE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT AT THE SAME RESERVATIONS STRESSES IN ADULT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER STERN. THINGS CHAIR I JUST JUST WANTED TO GET A TINY BIT OF CLARITY- FROM THE AUTHOR GOING FOR MY BIGGEST CONCERN- WAS THAT THE- SHE WAS THE INVERSE OF THE SENATOR FROM GUARDINO IS WHICH WAS NOT THAT THE BENEFITS- WILL BE OVER COUNTED BUT THAT THEY'LL BE UNDERCOUNTED THINGS LIKE RESILIENCY- THE ABILITY FOR THE GREAT SAY TO STAY ONLINE AND WILDFIRE ZONES THAT DAY TO GET YOU KNOW IT UNDER SOME DEFINITIONS THAT COULD BE SEEN AS A NON ENERGY BENEFITS. SO MY ONLY CONCERN IS THE P. YOU SEE LOOKS IT DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND LOOKS AT SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL VALUES OTHER ISSUES AROUND FORESTRY OR BIOMASS SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE NON ENERGY BENEFITS MAY BE RELATED TO YOU KNOW FORCE TO YOUR BIO MASS BENEFITS TO SOME OF THE PIECES LOOK AT SOMETIMES IT'S WILDFIRE IT JUST DEPENDS SO I APPRECIATE- I THINK I'VE HEARD WITH IT HEARD THE AUTHORS SAY MAYBE CAN JUST CLARIFIES THAT. YOU DON'T WANT THE BILL TO IMPACT. WHAT THE PUC'S DOING. ON OTHER FRONTS SAY IT'S A NET ENERGY METERING OR INTERCONNECTION OR OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU'RE SORT OF YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO STAY WITHIN THE LANE OF. HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE NON ENERGY BENEFITS ARE ASSESSED IN THE IN THIS SORT OF INCENTIVE BASED FRAMEWORK IN MY HEARING THAT RIGHT. YES ARE YOU THROUGH THE CHAIR SORRY. YES WE ARE A FOCUS ON THE BILLION DOLLARS HAS ALREADY COLLECTED TODAY AND THROUGH THIS MEASURE WE DO NOT MEAN TO INADVERTENTLY TIE AS I SAID TIED THE PUC'S HANDS. TO INCLUDE YOU KNOW DETERMINE THE BENEFITS OF RESILIENCE FOR- ACOSTA TAKEN STEPS TO SHOULD BE GENERATION OR ANY OF THAT GOING FORWARD SO YOU ARE CORRECT. I ALSO THINK THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE CASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THERE ISN'T ANYONE ELSE- SENATOR BAKER COULD YOU YOU WANNA MAKE YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS SURE I'LL JUST ADDRESS A FEW OF THE COMMENTS IN MY CLOTHES I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND ALL THE FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING WITH US. ON THIS BILL. JUST FOR THE CENTER FOR GARDENIA THIS. FEELING AS HE IS THE SHEER MENTIONS DOES INCLUDE WEATHER STATION PROGRAM IS A LOOK FORWARD TO. WORKING WITH HIM IN. A COLLECTIVELY ON A- ON ON HIS BILL. THAT I THINK WILL BE- AGAIN- ADDITIVE TO THIS. AND THE IDEA IS REALLY JUST YEAR MORE MONEY. TOWARDS POOR COMMUNITIES THAT DO GET MORE BUT YOU KNOW IT'S THE TO GET MORE BENEFITS. FROM CLEAR PINE FINANCES FROM SOLAR FROM WEATHER IS ATION. PROGRAMS THAT'S REALLY THE ATTENTIVE AND- AND JUST ADDRESS THE OTHER CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED AGAIN THIS IS NOT. GOING TO INCREASE FEES AT ALL THIS IS NOT INCREASING RATES AT ALL THIS IS A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S ALREADY COLLECTED. AND WE ARE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. HAVE MORE ACCESS TO THAT MONEY THAT IS ALREADY CONNECTED. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK AND FOR THE OTHER CLARIFICATIONS. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.
