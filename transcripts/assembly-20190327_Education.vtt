SO BY DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.586
TESTS THAT ARE JUNIORS TAKING A

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:37.388
JUNIOR YEAR IS A CRITICALLY

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:38.689
IMPORTANT HERE BUT ALSO A VERY

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:40.191
BUSY YEAR.

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:42.126
TAKING OUT FOUR DAYS OF TESTING.

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.728
IS A GOOD THING FOR THEM THEY'RE

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:45.262
READY TO TAKE THE SAT THEY KNOW

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:46.564
THE IMPLICATIONS IT MEANS

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:48.399
SOMETHING TO THEM AND THEY COME

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:50.835
PREPARED THAT DAY. TO DO THE

00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:52.169
ASPECT HAS AFTER THAT. FOR SOME

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:54.038
FOLKS AND AFTER ANY P. TEST HAS

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.207
ALREADY BEEN TAKEN -- LET'S JUST

00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:57.141
SAY THE FOCUS IS AND ALWAYS

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:58.242
THERE UNLESS IT'S HIGHLY

00:37:58.309 --> 00:38:00.044
INCENTIVIZE BY THINGS LIKE PROM

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:01.078
TICKETS IN YOUR BOOKS.

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:03.814
SO THIS IS AN OPTION FOR

00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:05.583
DISTRICTS TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.751
MEETS THE NEEDS OF THEIR VERY

00:38:06.817 --> 00:38:08.119
INDIVIDUALIZED SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:09.220
WITH OVER A THOUSAND IN THE

00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:10.588
STATE WE THINK THAT'S A VERY

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:11.722
IMPORTANT PIECE.

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:13.157
BUT WE KNOW FIRST HAND OUR KIDS

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:15.259

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:17.028
WANT TO SUPPORT THEM IN THIS

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:17.395

DURING THE SCHOOL DAY FOR FREE.

HELPING STUDENTS CONNECT TO THE

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:43.754
TEST IN FINANCIAL AID IS VERY

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:44.722
IMPORTANT.

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.524
IF YOU WANT MORE STUDENTS TO GO

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:09.260
WE DIDN'T GET OUR LETTER

00:42:09.326 --> 00:42:10.995
INTENDED TO MAKE THE COMMITTEE

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:13.797
ANALYSIS -- WE RECOGNIZE AND

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:14.832
APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS AN

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.967
EFFORT TO BOOST COLLEGE GOING

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:18.202
PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS THAT

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:19.737
WE ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF LOW

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:21.705
INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:23.040
COLOR.

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:26.377
BUT FRANKLY WE WE STUDIED THIS

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:28.045
OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR.

00:42:28.112 --> 00:42:29.813
WE AGONIZE OVER THE TRADE OFFS

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.515
AND THIS YEAR WE CAME TO A

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:33.117
DIFFERENT CONCLUSION AND THAT IS

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:34.852
WE THINK THE TRADE OFFS IN THE

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.387
COMPROMISE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:38.822
TO MAKE BY ADOPTING THIS BILL.

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:40.391
IS TOO GREAT OF A PRICE TO PAY.

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:42.693
AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS --

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.962
ARE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM RELIES

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:46.463
ON THE SCHOOL DASHBOARD. TO

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.499
IDENTIFY PROBLEMS BASED ON

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:50.501
COMPARING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:52.503
ACROSS SUB GROUPS AND ACROSS

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.038
DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES.

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:55.973
WHEN WE IDENTIFY A PROBLEM WE

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.508
HOPE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS BY

00:42:57.574 --> 00:43:00.177
DIRECTING ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.645
THROUGH THE SYSTEM SUPPORTS?

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:03.514
WE THINK THAT THIS APPROACH

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.050
ALTHOUGH WE APPLIED FREE AS A T.

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:06.717
FOR ALL.

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:08.018
WE THINK THIS APPROACH

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:10.254
UNDERMINES THE SORT OF THEORY OF

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:12.690
ACTION OF OUR SCHOOL DASHBOARD

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:13.490
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:16.226
ABLE TO SEE AS CLEARLY.

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:17.561
AS PRECISELY.

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:18.996
HOW STUDENTS ARE DOING BECAUSE

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:21.098
OUR SYSTEM RELIES ON COMPARING

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:22.366
THEM TO ONE ANOTHER?

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:24.735
SO WE HAVE STUDENTS TAKING

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.036
SEPARATE TESTS.

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.004
THERE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:29.306
PUT INTO PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:31.008
TO SOME KIND OF ALGORITHM OR

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:32.509
CONVERSION.

00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:34.244
AND EACH STEP THAT YOU TAKE TO

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:36.347
MAKE THAT CONVERSION IS GOING TO

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:37.548
INTRODUCE.

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:40.150
STATISTICAL ERROR VARIANCE IN

00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:41.618
IT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE CLARITY

00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:43.087
IN THE PRECISION OF THOSE

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:44.321
COMPARISONS.

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:46.957
SO OVERALL MY MAIN REASON FOR

00:43:47.024 --> 00:43:48.025
THE MAIN REASON WE'RE OPPOSED IS

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:49.393
THAT WE THINK THE TRADE OFF HERE

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.027
IS.

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:51.595
SOME STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.831
ABLE TO TAKE THE SAT FOR FREE.

00:43:53.897 --> 00:43:55.065
BUT THE STATE IS GOING TO BE

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:58.002
LESS ABLE TO CLEARLY SEE WHETHER

00:43:58.068 --> 00:44:00.304
OR NOT SCHOOLS ARE SERVING THEM

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:02.439
AND PREPARING THOSE STUDENTS TO

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.174
GAIN ADMISSION TO UNIVERSITY.

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:06.076
AND GO ON TO GRADUATE WE THINK

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:08.579
THAT THAT PRICE IS TOO HIGH TO

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:09.079
PAY.

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.314
SECONDLY.

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:11.648
WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.584
ABOUT ACCOMMODATIONS FOR TWO

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:16.053
SUBGROUPS IN PARTICULAR ENGLISH

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.621
LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WITH

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.089
SPECIAL WITH DISABILITIES.

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:21.925
LAST YEAR THE STATE ADVISORY

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:24.428
COMMISSION ON STUDENTS WITH

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:25.062
SPECIAL NEEDS LOOKED AT THIS

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:26.230
BILL.

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:28.532
THE THE PREVIOUS VERSION OPPOSED

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.267
IT AND CONCLUDED THAT STUDENTS

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.303
TO TAKE THE SAT OR STUDENTS WHO

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.038
TAKE.

00:44:34.104 --> 00:44:36.240
YES THE SAT FROM THOSE GROUPS

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:38.742
WOULD BE DISADVANTAGED RELATIVE

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:40.377
TO STUDENTS WHO TAKE THE S. BACK

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:41.712
SO THAT MEANS FOR THOSE GROUPS

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:43.547
WOULD BE EVEN LESS ABLE TO SEE

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:45.849
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THOSE SCHOOLS

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:47.451
AND IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.819
THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM FOR US AND

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:51.488
WE DON'T WANT TO RELY ON THE

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:52.856
PRESENT ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:55.392
AN INTERPRETATION OF REGULATIONS

00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:56.760
ON WHETHER OR NOT.

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:58.429
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S

00:44:58.495 --> 00:45:02.099
ENGLISH LONGER ENGLISH LEARNERS

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.100
ARE ADEQUATE.

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:04.468
LASTLY I THINK WE RESPECTFULLY

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:05.936
DISAGREE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:07.805
NOW IS THE TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.540
ON THE SAT.

00:45:09.606 --> 00:45:11.442
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:13.744
AN INVESTIGATION GOING ON OF THE

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:15.179
CURRENT SCANDAL.

00:45:15.245 --> 00:45:17.381
THE ACADEMIC SENATE IS REVIEWING

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:18.849
WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE USE

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:20.517
OF THE SAT IN UNIVERSITY

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:22.186
ADMISSIONS.

00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:24.021
UC REGENT AND THE COMMUNITY

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:25.456
COLLEGE CHANCELLOR YOU LLOYD

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:26.723
OAKLEY IS CALLING FOR

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.258
ELIMINATION OF THE USE OF THE S.

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:29.359
A. T..

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:30.761
AND IN MISSIONS.

00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:32.463
WE THINK RIGHT NOW'S NOT THE

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.498
TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE USE

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:36.133
OF THE S. A. T..

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.534
IN ADMISSIONS IN FACT WE THINK

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:39.002
NOW IS THE TIME TO PRESS THE

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:40.104
PAUSE BUTTON.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.705
AND ASK OURSELVES WHAT'S THE

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:43.073
EFFECT OF THE USE OF THE S. A.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.975
T. ON STUDENTS WHO ARE HAVING

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.243
TROUBLE ACCESSING HIGHER

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.277
EDUCATION.

00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:49.947
AND ARE WE DOING ALL THAT WE CAN

00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:53.517
TO REDUCE BIAS AND SAFEGUARD

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:54.885

EVERY DAY SO FOR THOSE REASONS

00:45:57.187 --> 00:46:00.757

WOULD BE BUILT INTO THE

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.947
DASHBOARD JUST AS THE RESULTS OF

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:26.049
THE ASPECTS ARE NOW -- IN THE

00:46:26.116 --> 00:46:28.519
BILL REQUIRES THE ASSESSMENT TO

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:29.019
BE ALIGNED TO THE STATE

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:29.920
STANDARDS.

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:30.888
MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:32.556
ENSURE THAT ACCOMMODATIONS ARE

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:33.757
PROVIDED IN SOME OF THE

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:35.492
OPPOSITION HE SPOKE OF WAS LAST

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:36.126
YEAR.

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:38.162
NOT TO THIS YEAR'S BILL SO I

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:39.963
APPRECIATE THAT BUT BUT BUT

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.431
AGAIN IF I GROUPS THAT OPPOSED

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:43.400
TO LAST YEAR -- THAT THAT THEY

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.701
ARE NOT HERE TODAY THEY'RE NOT

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:47.070
OPPOSING TODAY THAT -- THIS BILL

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:47.704
THEY ARE THEY'RE NEUTRAL AS FAR

AS I KNOW.

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:49.940
AND WITH REGARD TO SPECIAL ED

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:51.141
STUDENTS IT REQUIRES US TO

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:52.242
ACCOMMODATE SPECIAL STUDENTS IS

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:53.076
EVEN BETTER.

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:56.146
BECAUSE WE SCHOOL SITE PERSONNEL --

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.115
THAT WOULD BE -- INSURING THAT

00:46:58.182 --> 00:46:59.650
THE ACCOMMODATIONS ARE FULFILLED

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.251
AT THE SCHOOL SITE.

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.753
AND GIVING THE TEST AT THE

00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:04.855
SCHOOL SITE IS A SAFER MORE

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:06.657
SECURE ENVIRONMENT THEN THEN

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:07.758
THEN THEN I'VE BEEN OF SOME

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:09.860
PLACE OFF CAMPUS AND AND

00:47:09.927 --> 00:47:10.661
CONDUCTED BY A THIRD PARTY QUITE

00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:11.795
FRANKLY.

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:14.765
SO GIVEN THE CURRENT SCANDAL --

00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:16.533
I MEAN YOU CAN BLAME SAT YOU CAN

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.134
SAY A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:19.136
SAT BUT TO ME BLAMING US EIGHTY

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:20.871
FOR PEOPLE CHEATING ON IT'S KIND

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:21.805
OF LIKE BLAMING THE BANK FOR

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:22.573
GETTING ROBBED.

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:30.080
RIGHT -- IN AGAIN I I THINK.

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:30.714
THE CURRENT SITUATION MAKES THE

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:31.682
CASE FOR EIGHTY SEVEN FIVE ONE

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:32.282
BY ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:33.617
HAVE ACCESS TO TEST PREPARATION.

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:35.052
ONE INTO THE TEST IS GIVEN ON

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:37.654
SITE IN A VERY SECURE.

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:39.289
AND PROTOCOL ORIENTED FASHION

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:42.392
AND I KNOW MISS KERR HAD --

00:47:42.459 --> 00:47:42.960
THINK DID YOU WANT TO SHARE

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:43.660
SOMETHING.

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:46.096
WITH ME HE IS INTERESTED -- WE

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:47.497
DO HAVE RESEARCH TALKING ABOUT

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:49.233
THE CORRELATION RIGHT BETWEEN

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:51.201
THE SAT AND THE S. BACK -- AND

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:53.070
THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THEY ARE

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:53.904
BROADLY ASSESSING THE SAME

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:55.706
SKILLS THERE'S A ZERO POINT

00:47:55.772 --> 00:47:56.540
SEVEN SEVEN WHICH IS A STRONG

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:58.275
POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE

00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:00.010
ASPECT YOU NEED RW.

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.012
AN ASPECT YOU AWAY AND ZERO

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:02.913
POINT EIGHT TWO WHICH IS A VERY

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.947
STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:06.650
BETWEEN SAT MATH AND S. BACK

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:07.284
MATH.

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:07.951
BOTH TESTS INDICATE A COMPARABLE

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:09.052
PERCENTAGE OF ALL STUDENTS

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.288
MEETING THE STANDARDS IN THE LA

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:13.023
58% MET OR EXCEEDED S. BACK

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.359
WHILE FIFTY THREE MET SAT AND

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:16.026
MATH.

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:18.262
32% MET OR EXCEEDED S. BACK

00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:21.265
WHILE 31% MATT S..

00:48:21.331 --> 00:48:22.566
EIGHTY AND JUST ON THE SPECIAL

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:23.700
EDUCATION PIECE THERE'S

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:25.102
ESSENTIALLY A ONE TO ONE MATCH

00:48:25.168 --> 00:48:26.770
WHERE APPLICABLE BETWEEN THE

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:28.105
FORTY TWO UNIVERSAL TOOLS.

00:48:28.171 --> 00:48:29.306
DESIGNATED SUPPORTS AND

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:30.974
ACCOMMODATION WITH ANY ASPECT

00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:32.142
ANY ACCOMMODATIONS WITHIN THE

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:33.910
SAT.

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:35.112
THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:36.546
I WILL OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE

00:48:36.613 --> 00:48:40.651
MEMBER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:40.951
[inaudible]

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:42.419
DOCTOR WEBER [inaudible]

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:45.055
YES -- YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING THIS

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:46.323
IN REVERSE NOT RIVERSIDE LONG

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.958
BEACH I GATHER AT USING LONG

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:49.293
BEACH AND YOU ALSO STILL DO THE

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.594
TEST WE DO.

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:52.329
SO YOU DO THEM BOTH BECAUSE I AS

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:53.597
I LISTEN TO BOTH ARGUMENTS.

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:55.132
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S IT'S A STRONG

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:57.467
ARGUMENT FOR ACTUALLY HAVING YES

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.503
CITY ON CAMPUS AND FREE.

00:48:59.569 --> 00:49:01.138
I DIDN'T HEAR HOW IT HAD.

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:02.272
HOUSE STILL GIVING THE TEST

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:03.840
WOULD HAVE A THE OTHER TESTS AS

00:49:03.907 --> 00:49:04.608
BACK WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.575
EFFECT.

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:07.611
ON STUDENTS TO TAKE MORE THAN

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:08.478
ONE TEST IN THE ELEVENTH GRADE I

00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:09.813
MEAN.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.647
MY CONCERN IS ALWAYS BEEN WITH

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:12.049
AN AYE WE HAVE CONTINUING THE

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.216
SAME DATA SO THAT WE CAN ASSESS

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:14.484
WHAT NOT STUDENTS ARE MAKING A

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:15.686
KIND OF PROGRESS.

00:49:15.752 --> 00:49:16.853
AND WE'D LIKE TO THEM TO MAKE

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:17.854
AND SO HE'S KIND OF TAKE A PIECE

00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:19.990
OUT YOU YOU KIND OF BREAK THE

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:21.591
CYCLE IN TERMS OF PROGRESS BUT

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:23.093
BUT I THINK YOU'RE CONVERSATIONS

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:28.365
ALL SAID THAT YOU DO IT NOW.

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:29.032
ARE YOU STILL DO THE OTHER TESTS

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:29.566
CORRECT.

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:31.034
SO IS WORKING NOW SO WHY WOULD

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:31.568
WE WANT TO TAKE OUT THERE

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.337
BECAUSE I COULD SEE IS WANTING

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:33.904
TO BASICALLY ENCOURAGE EVERY

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.006
SCHOOL -- ESPECIALLY WITH KIDS

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:37.541
LOW INCOME TO BASICALLY DO THE

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:39.509
S. A. T. ON THEIR CAMPUS TO MAKE

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:41.211
IT FREE FOR KIDS TO BLACK

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:41.945
RESOURCES.

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:43.480
TO HAPPEN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:44.648
FOR THEM I THINK THAT'S THE

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:45.849
ISSUE OF EQUITY THAT THAT'S

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.584
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:51.154
NOT SURE WHAT THE NEGATIVE IS OF

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:51.722
YOUR CURRENT SYSTEM THAT YOU

00:49:51.788 --> 00:49:52.656
HAVE.

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:54.257
SO BECAUSE WE DO ADMINISTER BOTH

00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:55.559
TESTS WERE INCREASE THE COST OF

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:56.893
THOSE TASKS SO WHILE WE'RE

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.495
BROADLY USING THE PS EIGHTY AN

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:00.097
SAT FOR ALL OF THOSE YEARS WE

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:02.232
THEN DO THE S. BACK AGAIN WHICH

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:04.334
IS A FORTY TEST WHICH TAKES TIME

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:06.703
OUT AT STUDENT LEARNING AND

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:07.571
REFLECTION.

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:09.373
BUT IT'S ALSO NOT INCENTIVIZE

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:10.173
FOR THE STUDENTS BECAUSE THERE'S

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.509
NOTHING IN IT FOR THEM SO FOR MY

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:13.977
STUDENTS WHO TOOK THE ASPECT AS

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.245
JUNIORS THEY HAD ALREADY TAKEN

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:16.380
THE SAT.

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:17.647
AND THEY WERE WORKING TOWARDS

00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:19.649
COLLEGE ADMISSION BECAUSE TWO OF

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:20.250
MY KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL OUT OF

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:22.486
STATE -- SO THAT FOUR DAYS OF

00:50:22.552 --> 00:50:24.054
TESTING REALLY TOOK AWAY FROM

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:24.888
WHAT THEY WERE DOING IT FROM A

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:26.256
DISTRICT RESPECTED MORE THAN

00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:28.125
PAYING THE COST TO ADMINISTER A

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:28.925
SECOND TEST.

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:31.561
WHEN WE HAVE -- WHAT WE FEEL ARE

00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:34.131
EQUALLY IMPORTANT METRICS AS

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.665
WELL AS LONG TERM AT MULTI YEAR

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:37.234
METRICS THAT WE CAN USE TO DO

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.269
INTERVENTIONS IT IF I COULD IN

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:40.737
EVERY ON QUICKLY AND EVERYBODY

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:42.272
EVERY SINGLE TAKE THE SAT?

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:43.740
THERE WOULD NOT BE SOME CRACKING

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:44.941
AND SOME NOT SO WE OFFERED TWICE

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.209
A YEAR ACTUALLY SO WE OFFER IT

00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:47.978
TODAY IN THE SPRING FOR YOUR

00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:49.746
STUDENTS WE ALSO OFFERED AGAIN

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:51.448
FOR FREEIN THE FALL. FOR OUR

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:53.116
SENIORS WHO ARE LOOKING TO BUMP

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:54.651
UP THEIR SCORES FOR THEIR CSU

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:55.886
INDEX FOR SOME OF THE MORE

00:50:55.952 --> 00:50:56.853
COMPETITIVE SCHOOLS HAVE A

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.155
HIGHER REQUIREMENT.

00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.523
AND WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY AT

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:00.991
THAT POINT FOR SOMEONE TO GAIN

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.959
ADMISSION TO THE CSU IS TO

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:04.227
CHANGE THEIR SAT SCORE THEY

00:51:04.294 --> 00:51:05.195
CAN'T CHANGE THEIR GPA AT THAT

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:05.695
POINT.

00:51:05.762 --> 00:51:07.164
BUT WE DO THE MATH AND WE SEE

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:08.064
THAT IF THEY GOT FOUR MORE

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:09.866
QUESTIONS CORRECT ON THE SAT IN

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:11.268
THE FALL THAT BUMPED UP THEIR

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:12.869
ELIGIBILITY WHICH HELPS OUR LONG

00:51:12.936 --> 00:51:14.004
BEACH COLLEGE PROMISE.

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:14.971
SO LAST YEAR WE HAD

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:16.640
APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED

00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:17.641
FIFTEEN STUDENTS WHO WERE JUST

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:19.443
BARELY OFF THE COLLEGE PROMISE

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:21.645
METRIC OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.146
FOR CAL STATE LONG BEACH -- BUT

00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:24.581
WE NOTIFY THEM THEY KNEW WHAT

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:25.649
THEIR SCORES THEY DID SOME

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:28.985
REALLY INVALID INDIVIDUALIZED --

00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:31.421
TUTORING IN THOSE AREAS AND

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:33.824
APPROXIMATELY A HALF I BELIEVE

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.292
WE'RE ABLE TO BUMP UP THEIR SAT

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:36.927
A SCORE ENOUGH TO ALLOW THEM

00:51:36.993 --> 00:51:37.761
ADMISSION INTO CAL STATE LONG

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:39.129
BEACH SO IT HAS VERY REAL TIME A

00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:41.264
FAX -- SO THAT'S OUR COMMITMENT

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:47.938
TO THEM THAT WE'LL DO EVERYTHING

00:51:48.004 --> 00:51:50.073
WE CAN TO SUPPORT THAT.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:50.907
YOU WANT TO TELL YOU I JUST WANT

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:51.975
TO SHARE THEIR YOU JUST SAID IT

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:52.542
BASICALLY IT'S AN ASSESSMENT

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:52.776
SYSTEM.

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:53.844
NOT JUST A TRYING SYSTEM

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:54.411
ASSESSMENTS.

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:55.345
ADDRESS ACHIEVEMENT GAPS WITHIN

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:56.413
THAT ASSESSMENT SYSTEM ARENA.

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.081
AND IT INVESTED LISTEN KIDS A

00:51:58.148 --> 00:51:58.415
LOT OF GREAT.

00:51:58.482 --> 00:51:59.015
LOVE THEM THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:00.250
REAL INVESTED IN THESE TESTS

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:01.751
THAT DON'T MEAN A LOT TO THEM IN

00:52:01.818 --> 00:52:03.620
THE US BACK IS SUCH A TEST.

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:05.021
AND ALSO TIME TO GO.

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:06.957
TO THE LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:08.558
ADMINISTERING THE ASPECT ARE

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.360
SIGNIFICANT ESPECIALLY SOME OF

00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:11.461
OUR LARGER HIGH SCHOOLS THEY

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:12.829
WILL DISRUPT CLASSES FOR TWO

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:13.830
THREE WEEKS SOMETIMES.

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:15.966
JUST TO GET THAT TIME WINDOW --

00:52:16.032 --> 00:52:17.334
THAT STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE THE

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.202
ASPECT HAS TO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:20.504
OF TIME AND THEN AGAIN IN THAT

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:21.605
ELEVENTH GRADE YOU'RE A LOT OF

00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:23.306
KIDS HAVE A LOT OF STUFF GOING

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:25.375
ON THERE'S A P. TASKS -- THERE'S

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:26.843
COLLEGE APPLICATIONS THERE'S

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.411
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON

00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:29.946
DURING THAT ELEVENTH GRADE YEAR.

00:52:30.013 --> 00:52:33.550
THAT I THINK GIVING -- THAT THIS

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:35.085
APPROACH IS IS IS.

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:39.489
IS SMARTER TESTING NOT JUST MORE

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:41.157
TESTS.

00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:42.959
YEAH I'D LIKE TO WELL I I'M NOT

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:43.627
SUPPORTED TO DOUSE THE I'LL TRY

00:52:43.693 --> 00:52:44.628
TO GET THE ONLY INFORMATION THAT

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:45.495
HE HAD THAT HE SHARED WITH UP.

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:46.830
WITH THAT BECAUSE I'VE HAD SOME

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:49.032
CONCERNS BUT I THINK IT'S A I

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:50.200
THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:51.701
MAKE SAT AVAILABLE TO ALL

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:52.802
STUDENTS WHO WANT IT.

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:54.371
I KNOW DOING ANYTHING ON CAMPUS

00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:55.939
SOMETIMES A POSITIVE EFFECT FOR

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:58.275
STUDENTS AND SURELY PAYING FOR

00:52:58.341 --> 00:52:59.943
THAT NUMBER SCHOOL TO PAY FOR IT.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.611
AND AND AND IT'S A GOOD USE OF

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.079
THE TITLE ONE DOLLARS AND

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:04.548
EVERYTHING ELSE IS THERE TO GIVE

00:53:04.614 --> 00:53:05.582
THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:07.584
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE I DON'T KNOW

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:09.252
THE DATE WITH REGARD TO HOW WELL

00:53:09.319 --> 00:53:11.154
STUDENTS DO ON THAT KIND OF HIS

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:12.122
VERSES IS BAD.

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.690
I'M NOT SURE THE STUDENTS NOT

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:15.325
MOTIVATED ON ANY TESTS IS NOT BE

00:53:15.392 --> 00:53:17.527
ON SAID MOTIVATED ON SAT WHEN

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:18.061
THEY THEMSELVES HAVE NO

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:19.829
INTENTIONS OF OF GOING BEYOND

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:20.897
WHERE THEY ARE YOU KNOW IN OTHER

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:22.832
WORDS JUST GRADUATING IN DOING

00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:23.466
SOMETHING ELSE.

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:24.668
I'M NOT TOO THERE'S A REAL BIG

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:26.670
MOTIVATION FOR THAT BUT BUT IT

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:28.338
WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.540
WHAT IT IS AND WHETHER NOT WE

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:32.709
STILL NEED TOOLS TO ASSESS PUT

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.578
FOR TEACHING WITH REGARDS TO THE

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:35.712
S. BACK AS WITHIN OUT WHAT WE'RE

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:36.813
DOING IS EFFECTIVE OR

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.415
INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN?

00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:39.683
DOING THE SMARTER BALANCED WE'VE

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:40.183
BEEN DOING THE NEW CORE

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.851
CURRICULUM AND ALL THAT STUFF

00:53:41.918 --> 00:53:43.820
AND SO NEEDING TO CONSTANTLY

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.221
ASSESS WHAT THE NOT STUDENTS ARE

00:53:45.288 --> 00:53:46.423
GETTING IT MOVING FORWARD WITH

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:47.490
IT OR WHATEVER.

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:49.059
I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENS BUT I

00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:50.527
I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:52.062
BASICALLY HAVE AN ON CAMPUS FOR

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:53.663
EVERY STUDENT CHOOSE TO HAVE IT

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.498
AT A COST OF THREE YES NO

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:55.765
QUESTION.

00:53:55.832 --> 00:53:57.000
THANK YOU.

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:57.634
AND THERE IS A THERE IS A STUDY

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:59.336
OUT OF UC DAVIS I DON'T KNOW THE

00:53:59.402 --> 00:54:01.271
AUTHOR OF THE STUDY WHICH SHOWS

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:01.905
THAT THE TESTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.006
CORRELATED.

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:05.141
AND AND AS FAR AS HOW THEY

00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:06.943
PREDICT COLLEGE SUCCESS AND THAT

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.511
THE SAT IS ACTUALLY A SLIGHTLY

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:17.320
AS I UNDERSTAND IT A SLIGHTLY

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:19.122
BETTER PROTECT.

00:54:19.189 --> 00:54:20.657
YEAH BUT THE IN ADDITION TO THAT

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:22.525
THE THE STUDY OFTEN SHOWS TO

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:22.726
THAT.

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:23.793
STUDENTS OF COLOR DO BETTER ON

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.061
ACT AND SAT.

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.062
AND SO IT WOULD PUSH EVERYBODY

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:27.163
S. A. T. THERE WERE KIDS OF

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.064
COLOR DON'T DO VERY WELL.

00:54:28.131 --> 00:54:28.632
BUT THEY DO MUCH BETTER IN A

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:29.699
CITY BECAUSE OF THE FORMAT OF IT

00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:30.800
THEN WE MAY BE PUSHING THEM INTO

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:31.901
AN AREA WHERE.

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:32.736
YOU KNOW BECAUSE A LOT OF FOLKS

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:33.737
AND TALKING TO NOW WITH KIDS

00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:34.270
PUTTING THEM IN A CITIES

00:54:34.337 --> 00:54:35.872
PARTICULAR AFRICAN AMERICANS

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:37.440
BECAUSE IT CITIES HAS NOT BEEN.

00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:39.109
A WHATEVER THAT HONEST I'VE DONE

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:41.144
AND ALL THE TESTS AND AGES BUT I

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:42.345
KNOW THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:43.013
BETTER TEST IN A BETTER

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:43.913
ASSESSMENT.

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.182
OF AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS SO IF

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:47.651
YOU WANT TO GO TO SAT YOU'VE GOT

00:54:47.717 --> 00:54:48.451
A NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:49.986
KIDS IN THERE.

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:50.887
THEY MAY STILL WANT TO TAKE THE

00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:52.255
ACT THE PANTS ARE CONSCIOUS OF

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:53.289
IT SO THEY MAY FIND THEMSELVES

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:54.758
ONCE AGAIN BEING TESTED OVER AND

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:56.793
OVER AGAIN -- IN ORDER TO

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:57.861
ACHIEVE WHAT THEY WANT TO CHEESE

00:54:57.927 --> 00:54:59.362
SO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK YOU

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:00.664
SHOULD CONSIDER AS YOU MOVE

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.165
FORWARD WITH THIS THAT.

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:03.433
EVEN AS A T. HAS ITS CULTURAL

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.968
BIASES OF THE GENERALLY NOT IN

00:55:05.035 --> 00:55:06.002
FAVOR.

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.737
OF KIDS OF COLOR YOU KNOW IT'S

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:09.305
KIND LIKE THE I. Q. TESTS THEY

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:10.140
DO WE ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF KIDS

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:11.107
OF COLOR.

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:12.609
AND THE TEST A WHOLE LOT OF

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:14.077
STUFF IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:15.612
THAT GOES FAR BEYOND WHAT TO DO

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:17.280

THIS BILL.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.855
UNDER EXISTING LAW IF A STUDENT

WITH MISTER SIMONS AND TESTS.

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:29.765
HOWEVER FOR STUDENTS SUSPENDED

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:31.067
IT IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:32.602
TEACHER TO PROVIDE OF MISSED

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:33.402
WORK.

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:36.005
EVEN IF THE STUDENT OR PARENT

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:37.273
REQUESTED.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.241
AB NINE EIGHTY TWO WOULD REQUIRE

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:39.442
TEACHERS TO PROVIDE MISSED

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.143
HOMEWORK OF A PARENT OR GUARDIAN

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.279

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:44.747
SUSPENDED.

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.215
AS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:47.450
EVEN WITH THE DECLINE IN

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:48.918
SUSPENSIONS DISPARITIES STILL

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:50.453
EXIST.

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:51.520
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:52.922
CONTINUE TO BE SUSPENDED AT MUCH

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:55.791
HIGHER RATES THAN OTHER GROUPS.

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.326
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:59.195
PREVENT STUDENTS FROM FALLING

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:02.765
BEHIND AND BECOMING MORE OF A

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.367
JUST DISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS.

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.369
IT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:06.936
TO ADD ADDITIONAL BURDEN TO

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:07.803
TEACHERS.

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:09.605
SINCE THE TEACHERS ALREADY HAVE

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.974
A PREPARED LESSON PLAN THEY

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:12.908
WOULD JUST NEED TO SHARE THE

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.810
INFORMATION WITH THE PARENT OR

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:17.947
GUARDIAN UPON REQUEST.

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:20.816
AB NINE EIGHTY TWO IS CLEAR THAT.

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:23.519
THE GRADING OR PROVIDING CREDIT

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.354
FOR THIS MISSED WORK IS UP TO

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.590
THE DISCRETION OF THE TEACHER.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.358
I KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF THIS

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:30.059
COMMITTEE UNDERSTAND THE

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.727
IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATING ALL

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:32.895
STUDENTS.

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:34.463
AND IF THE PARENTS ARE CONCERNED

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:35.698
ENOUGH TO REQUEST THE HOMEWORK

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:40.136
AND TEACHERS SHOULD PROVIDE THE-SAME CLASS WORK THAT IS PROVIDED

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:40.503
TO THE EXCUSED.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.371
STUDENTS.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:43.873
IT IS SAFE TO SAY WE ARE ALL

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:45.474
HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE WANT ALL

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:46.676

TO SPEAK SUCCEED.

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:49.612
AND WE CANNOT IGNORE THE LASTING

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:51.681
IMPACT THE SUSPENSIONS HAVE ON

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:53.149
STUDENTS.

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:55.584
THIS BILL IS JUST ONE SMALL STEP.

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:56.585
TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:58.220
ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:40.463
WHICH IS WHY IN CALIFORNIA --

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:41.731
SUSPENSIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:46.369

VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:55.944
RATHER THAN THINKING IN TERMS OF

REMOVING THEM FROM A SCHOOL

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:57.279

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:17.933
FOURTH ONCE BEFORE WE HAD A

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.001
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT SOME WHILE

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:19.368
AGO.

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:21.103
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU --

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:21.770
STICKING WITH IT AND BRINGING IT

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:22.838
FORWARD.

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.773
I ONLY HAVE ONE PROBLEM AND THAT

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.909
IS THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.210
THE HOME WOULD BE GREAT IT.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.212
AND I I AND I AND AND THAT IS

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:31.880
STATED THERE -- AND I HAVE A

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:33.682
REAL CONCERN ABOUT THAT --

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.284
BECAUSE I THINK -- I'M IF MY

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.819
UNDERSTANDS CORRECT OUR SCHOOLS

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:38.320
ARE STILL GETTING PAID EIGHTY

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:39.521
EIGHT WHEN KIDS ARE SUSPENDED.

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:40.856
SO THE MONEY IS STILL COMING

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:42.291
INTO THE SCHOOLS TO SUPPORT THE

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:44.159
SCHOOL WILD KIDS ARE NOT THE

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:47.096
YOURSELF -- HAVING GIVE HOMEWORK

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:48.897
AND THEN HAVE NO ONE TO GREAT IT --

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:50.432
MAYBE THE PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:51.967
BACKGROUND EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:52.901
TO UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT MATTER

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:53.969
IF THE DEAL WITH ALGEBRA

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:55.604
WHATEVER IT MAY BE.

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.372
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT -- IT'S

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.408
NICE TO TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:02.010
MATERIAL I THINK IT'S BETTER TO

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:03.178
TO KEEP THEM IN THE PROCESS TO

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:04.813
HAVE THE TEACHERS OF GRADE

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.914
MATERIAL.

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.983
I YOU KNOW I JUST I I SAW THAT I

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.051
THOUGHT WELL WHY WOULD.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:11.086
YOU GIVE HOMEWORK IN SOME CASES

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:12.855
SEAT IS BUSY WORK UP BECAUSE

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.256
IT'S NOT BEEN GREAT.

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:15.591
AND SO THEY'RE NOT EVEN SURE IF

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:16.525
THEY'RE UNDERSTANDING THE

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:17.893
MATERIAL WHEN THEY COME BACK TO

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.494
THE CLASS THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.028
SAME HOPEFULLY UNDERSTANDING AS

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:21.063
OTHERS.

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.164
BEING SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL IS

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:25.334
PUNITIVE ENOUGH YOU KNOW NOT

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.735
WHICH APPEARS AND TO LEARN THE

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:27.636
KID MIGHT THINK IT'S A GREAT

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:27.870
THING.

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:28.971
BUT I THINK AS A PARENT WE KNOW

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:30.906
THAT THAT IS A HORRIBLE THING TO

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:33.609
HAPPEN FOR YOUR CHILD MS TWO

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:33.809
DAYS.

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:35.077
OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE -- SO I

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:36.044
DON'T KNOW WHY MAYBE YOU COULD

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:37.980
TELL ME WHY WOULD NOT ASKING

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.047
FOLKS TO GRADE THE HOMEWORK.

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:40.249
THAT WOULD GIVING WORK BUT WE'RE

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:42.751
NOT ASKING TO BE GRADED RIGHT --

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:50.459
I APPRECIATE THE THE QUESTION

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.060
DOCTOR WHATEVER I IT'S A

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.328
RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHAIR OF

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:56.331
THE COMMITTEE THAT.

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:56.632
IT WAS NOT.

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:58.200
NOT WHAT.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.802
THAT THAT I I I DIDN'T.

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:00.435
THAT ACTUALLY DID NOT COME FROM

01:14:00.502 --> 01:14:01.103
THE COMMITTEE BUT I THINK THAT'S

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:01.737
A CONVERSATION YOU SHOULD HAVE

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:02.104
GOING FORWARD.

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.472
ABOUT WHETHER NOT TO AMENDED TO

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:04.072
ENSURE THAT IT IS GREAT AND I

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.107
GET.

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:07.309
I GET THE CONCERNED WHY WOULD

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.477
YOU HAVE THEM DO IT IF IT'S NOT

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:09.478
GREAT MY OWN CLASSROOM HONESTLY

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:10.579
I I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:11.980
THE SIGNING WORK TO STUDENTS

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:13.415
SUSPENDED AND THEN GRADING IT.

01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:14.883
WASN'T A CHALLENGE TO ME IT

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:15.851
SEEMS LIKE A NO BRAINER THAT YOU

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:16.919
WOULD DO THAT SO I THINK WE

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:18.487
SHOULD DO IS KIND OF LIKE GOING

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:19.421
FOR WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:20.522
INCLUDE THAT.

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.524
I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:25.427
TO INCLUDE IT -- AND AND I I I

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:26.628
UNDERSTAND IT'S IT'S I DON'T

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.197
THINK IT SHOULD BE ACTUAL WORK

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:28.797
OF THE TEACHERS WILL BE GREEN

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:29.932
HOMEWORK ANYWAY.

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:30.933
I WOULD HOPE THAT A TEACHER

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:32.100
WOULD HAVE THAT MAYBE IT'S

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:34.436
SUSPENDED STUDENTS THAT BETTER.

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:35.037
IT BECOMES.

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:36.772
A YOU KNOW UNBELIEVABLE BUT AT

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:38.440
THE SAME TIME I I THINK IT HAS

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:40.108
VALUE TO BE ABLE TO FOR THE

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:41.443
STUDENTS KNOW THAT THIS WORK

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:44.112
MATTERS -- AND AND THEY NEED TO

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:45.214
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND IT ALSO

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.249
GIVES SOME LEVERAGE TO PARENTS.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.450
TO GET THE WORK DONE AND GET IT

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:49.718
DONE A CORRECTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:51.587
GOING TO GET SOME RESPONSE BACK

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.255
AS TO HOW WELL THE STUDENT DID

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:53.922
FOR THOSE TWO DAYS THEY HAD TO

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:54.523
DO.

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.191
IT WOULD HOME DOING HOMEWORK SO.

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:57.726
I THINK AS YOU MOVE FORWARD YOU

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:58.594
MAY WANT TO CONSIDER I THINK IT

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.028
STRENGTHENS IT MUCH MORE THAN

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:01.163
JUST SIMPLY ASKING FOR CAUSES

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.332
LIKE MAYBE BUSY WORK WHATEVER.

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:04.466
THAT IT OUGHT TO HAVE SOME VALUE

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:06.001
AND IT KEEPS THE STUDENTS ON

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.970

01:59:47.547 --> 01:59:48.848
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:50.016
REALIZATION THAT A LOT OF OUR

01:59:50.082 --> 01:59:51.217

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.302
CONFUSING AND WHAT YOU'RE

02:00:09.368 --> 02:00:10.903

NEVER BEING EXPOSED -- IT IS IS

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:15.341
A BARRIER AND SO WE WANT TO TRY

02:00:15.408 --> 02:00:17.143
TO REDUCE THAT WITH THE LEAST

02:00:17.209 --> 02:00:18.678

02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:49.061
MOST STUDIES DON'T SHOW A

02:12:49.127 --> 02:12:50.729
POSITIVE EFFECT OF TEACHER

02:12:50.796 --> 02:12:51.363

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.831
THE STUDIES THEY DO FIND A

02:12:52.898 --> 02:12:54.599
POSITIVE EFFECT TYPICALLY DON'T

02:12:54.666 --> 02:12:56.268
FIND IN EFFECT UNTIL THE FOURTH

02:12:57.703 --> 02:12:58.670
ONLY IN MATH.

02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:01.073

TEACHERS ARE GONE BY THE FOURTH

02:13:02.808 --> 02:13:04.643
AND FIFTH YEARS I THINK YOU HAVE%

02:13:04.710 --> 02:13:06.945
TO PUT A BIG ASTERIX BY THOSE

02:13:07.012 --> 02:13:08.313

02:13:11.983 --> 02:13:12.751

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:14.453

ON THIS TO THERE'S A COUPLE

02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:08.539
THINGS THAT COME TO MIND ONE IS --

02:29:08.606 --> 02:29:10.608
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE ONE LOW

02:29:10.675 --> 02:29:13.010

AND THAT BEING SAID I I I DO

02:29:25.056 --> 02:29:26.891
APPRECIATE THE ASPECT OF THE

02:29:26.957 --> 02:29:28.793
BILL THAT.

02:29:28.859 --> 02:29:30.294

SHOULD BE THAT.

02:29:34.098 --> 02:29:35.232

ULTIMATELY THAT INTERNSHIP TYPE

02:29:41.572 --> 02:29:44.241
PROGRAMS THE PURPOSE SHOULD BE

02:29:44.308 --> 02:29:46.243
AS WE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES

AND SO WE WANT TO FIND WAYS TO

02:30:02.059 --> 02:30:03.728
GET PEOPLE.

02:30:03.794 --> 02:30:05.463

WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A LONG A

02:30:21.245 --> 02:30:22.346

YOU KNOW WE GET OUT FOLKS THAT

02:30:30.988 --> 02:30:31.522

02:30:47.838 --> 02:30:48.739
CERTAINLY IS THE SHORT TERM

02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:49.006
IMPACTS.

02:30:49.073 --> 02:30:52.209

TITLE ONE SCHOOLS.

02:30:53.077 --> 02:30:56.180
I HAVE SOME DISTRICTS I THINK

02:30:56.247 --> 02:30:57.882
PROBABLY A MANY OF US DO THAT

02:30:57.948 --> 02:30:59.216

02:30:59.283 --> 02:31:00.718

IN THOSE DISTRICTS.

02:31:17.501 --> 02:31:18.502
THE SHORT TERM PRAGMATIC REALITY

02:31:18.569 --> 02:31:20.471
IS THAT I HAVE SOME DISTRICT

02:31:20.538 --> 02:31:22.573

02:31:46.430 --> 02:31:48.165
AGAIN YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS THE

02:31:48.232 --> 02:31:49.700
NUMBER OF US ARE.

02:31:49.767 --> 02:31:51.068
THAT IS THE WILLINGNESS TO HAVE

02:31:51.135 --> 02:31:53.971
SOMETHING CONVERSATIONS ON JUST.

02:31:54.038 --> 02:31:55.139
IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE OF

02:31:55.206 --> 02:31:57.408
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE IN SOME OF

02:31:57.475 --> 02:32:00.578
THE DISTRICTS AND AND MY

02:32:00.644 --> 02:32:02.480
COMMUNITY I I DON'T.

02:32:02.546 --> 02:32:04.548
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY

02:32:04.615 --> 02:32:05.049
SCHOOLS PERFORM POORLY.

02:32:05.115 --> 02:32:07.885
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE THE

02:32:07.952 --> 02:32:08.986
ADDRESS A LOT OF THEM AND I

02:32:09.053 --> 02:32:09.854
THINK THAT.

02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:11.555
CREATING THAT LONG TERM PIPELINE

02:32:11.622 --> 02:32:13.724
IS ABSOLUTELY A CORRECTLY

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:15.993
IDENTIFIED ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:17.761
MAKE SURE THAT THAT.

02:32:17.828 --> 02:32:19.330
AGAIN WITH OTHER COMING THROUGH

02:32:19.396 --> 02:32:21.031
A CSU INTERNSHIP WITH THEIR

02:32:21.098 --> 02:32:22.233
COMING THROUGH A THIRD PARTY IN

02:32:22.299 --> 02:32:23.000
SHIP YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THEY

02:32:23.067 --> 02:32:23.801
STAY THERE AND THE LADY LOVE

02:32:23.868 --> 02:32:25.236
TEACHING AND THAT THEY'RE

02:32:25.302 --> 02:32:26.570
THEY'RE NOT JUST FIVE YEARS BUT

02:32:26.637 --> 02:32:29.707
HOPEFULLY. TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT

02:32:29.773 --> 02:32:31.642
IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND

02:32:31.709 --> 02:32:32.776
EFFORT ENERGY TO HOW WE GET

02:32:32.843 --> 02:32:34.478
THERE AND SO I WOULD LOVE.

02:32:34.545 --> 02:32:36.046
THE OPPORTUNITY HOPEFULLY GET A

02:32:36.113 --> 02:32:37.515
COMMITMENT THAT WE CAN KEEP

02:32:37.581 --> 02:32:42.386
TALKING ON HOW WE ENSURE.

02:32:42.453 --> 02:32:43.587
THAT.

02:32:43.654 --> 02:32:44.855
THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:32:44.922 --> 02:32:45.789
NOT CREATING A LEASE SHORT TERM

02:32:45.856 --> 02:32:47.024
TRAUMA FOR SOME OF THE DISTRICTS

02:32:47.091 --> 02:32:48.325
BUT INTENTIONALLY.

02:32:48.392 --> 02:32:51.529
THAT IF WE DO GET A LONGER TERM

02:32:51.595 --> 02:32:55.366
COMMITMENT FROM ORGANIZATIONS --

02:32:55.432 --> 02:32:57.067
THAT MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE A PATH

02:32:57.134 --> 02:32:58.402
TO ALLOWING SOME THIRD PARTY

02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:59.737
ORGANIZATIONS WOULD YOU BE OPEN

02:32:59.803 --> 02:33:01.605
TO THAT CONVERSATION IF THERE'S

02:33:01.672 --> 02:33:03.474
AGAIN PARAMETERS IN PLACE THAT

02:33:03.541 --> 02:33:04.508
ENSURE.

02:33:04.575 --> 02:33:07.044
THAT IT'S REALLY BEING DONE TO

02:33:07.111 --> 02:33:10.080
CREATE A PIPELINE. FOR FUTURE

02:33:10.147 --> 02:33:10.648
TEACHING I I HOPE THAT MAKES

02:33:10.714 --> 02:33:11.682
SENSE.

02:33:11.749 --> 02:33:16.086
I WILL SAY THAT WE OPPOSITION --

02:33:16.153 --> 02:33:18.422
FOLKS WHO ARE HERE ARE OUR

02:33:18.489 --> 02:33:19.657
TEACHER OF THE YEAR WE WANT THAT

02:33:19.723 --> 02:33:21.058
PIPELINE SO I THINK WE HAVE SOME

02:33:21.125 --> 02:33:22.326
COMMON GROUND.

02:33:22.393 --> 02:33:23.494
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:33:23.561 --> 02:33:24.562
TEACHERS STAY IN THE CLASSROOM

02:33:24.628 --> 02:33:25.796
PASSED THAT PROFICIENCY IN TH OF

02:33:25.863 --> 02:33:27.264
IT TAKES TWO TO THREE YEARS TO

02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:28.899
BECOME PROFICIENT ON AVERAGE.

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:30.034
THE VIEW IN RECENT YEARS BEYOND

02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:31.835
THAT FOR THE INVESTMENT THAT

02:33:31.902 --> 02:33:35.573
THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO THIS -- I

02:33:35.639 --> 02:33:37.808
IF WE HAVE TEACHERS LIKE

02:33:37.875 --> 02:33:38.409
YOURSELF WE HAVE TO JUST LIKE

02:33:38.475 --> 02:33:39.543
MYSELF THAT.

02:33:39.610 --> 02:33:40.544
WE FIGURED IT OUT AND WE STAY

02:33:40.611 --> 02:33:41.845
THERE RIGHT I STAY THERE FOR

02:33:41.912 --> 02:33:42.446
THIRTEEN YEARS AND IT'S ALWAYS

02:33:42.513 --> 02:33:45.215
BEEN MY INTENTION TO RETURN TO

02:33:45.282 --> 02:33:47.084
THE CLASSROOM AFTER THIS CASE UP --

02:33:47.151 --> 02:33:49.286
AND AND SO WE CAN DEFINITELY

02:33:49.353 --> 02:33:50.754
HAVE THAT EXAMPLES BUT HOW DO WE

02:33:50.821 --> 02:33:52.189
MAKE SURE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY.

02:33:52.256 --> 02:33:53.791
ARE US AND WE'RE NOT THE

02:33:53.857 --> 02:33:54.992
EXCEPTION WHICH IS AT THE DATA

02:33:55.059 --> 02:33:56.026
SHOWING US RIGHT NOW IT'S I

02:33:56.093 --> 02:33:57.361
THINK WE HAVE THAT.

02:33:57.428 --> 02:33:59.029
IN COMMON I THINK I'M ONLY TO

02:33:59.096 --> 02:34:00.197
HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH

02:34:00.264 --> 02:34:02.733
EVERYONE I THINK MY PLAINTIFF OF

02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:03.701
THIS BILL EVEN PARADIS IS

02:34:03.767 --> 02:34:04.835
STARTED DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:06.403
MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS.

02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:07.605
WHEN WE IDENTIFY SCHOOLS HAD A

02:34:07.671 --> 02:34:09.073
ONE WAY SEEN THESE KIDS FROM THE

02:34:09.139 --> 02:34:11.942
BEGINNING HAVE ALL THE SYSTEMIC

02:34:12.009 --> 02:34:13.677
BARRIERS AGAINST THEM?

02:34:13.744 --> 02:34:14.912
DOES THIS ADD TO THE SYSTEMIC

02:34:14.979 --> 02:34:15.646
BARRIERS AND IF SO HOW DO WE

02:34:15.713 --> 02:34:16.680
MAKE SURE WE RATIFY FOR SOME OF

02:34:16.747 --> 02:34:18.449
THAT AND AND EVEN MORE SO WITH

02:34:18.515 --> 02:34:20.150
THEIR SPECIAL AT US SPECIAL ED

02:34:20.217 --> 02:34:21.018
STUDENTS AND NEEDS.

02:34:21.085 --> 02:34:22.620
AN ALLEY YOU IS THE ALL OF OUR

02:34:22.686 --> 02:34:24.054
TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS ONLY

02:34:24.121 --> 02:34:25.623
TEACHING SPECIAL EVENTS ARE MOST

02:34:25.689 --> 02:34:27.191
ONE OF THE STUDENTS OF COLOR

02:34:27.257 --> 02:34:29.493
SPECIAL THAT -- YOU KNOW AND SO

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:30.728
AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:34:30.794 --> 02:34:32.162
HAVING THAT DISCUSSION THIS

02:34:32.229 --> 02:34:33.063
TRAUMA WHEN YOU HAVE THIS

02:34:33.130 --> 02:34:34.765
CONSTANT CYCLE EVERY TWO TO

02:34:34.832 --> 02:34:35.299
THREE YEARS PEOPLE LEAVING

02:34:35.366 --> 02:34:36.467
THERE'S A TRAUMA THAT HAPPENS TO

02:34:36.533 --> 02:34:37.234
THE STUDENTS ARE THE TRAUMA

02:34:37.301 --> 02:34:37.768
HAPPENS IS GOING TO THE

02:34:37.835 --> 02:34:38.902
COMMUNITY.

02:34:38.969 --> 02:34:40.004
THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING I'M

02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:42.072
PRAGMATIC I'M MORE THAN WILLING

02:34:42.139 --> 02:34:43.540
TO ENGAGE ON A TIME LINE THAT

02:34:43.607 --> 02:34:45.676
MAKES SENE THAT MIGHT BE FAIR.

02:34:45.743 --> 02:34:46.710
TO TO ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE

02:34:46.777 --> 02:34:48.078
BEEN RELYING ON THESE PROGRAMS

02:34:48.145 --> 02:34:49.346
TO COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY AS

02:34:49.413 --> 02:34:51.081
WE MOVE FORWARD BUT I WANT TO

02:34:51.148 --> 02:34:51.649
MAKE SURE THAT AS I'M BEING

02:34:51.715 --> 02:34:52.916
PRAGMATIC AND I'M OPEN THAT THE

02:34:52.983 --> 02:34:54.184
OTHER SET IS OPEN.

02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:55.185
TO SOME OF THESE A MOMENT THAT

02:34:55.252 --> 02:34:57.221
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN FROM THE

02:34:57.287 --> 02:35:02.459
COMMITEE CHAIR TO DAY -- AND SO.

02:35:02.526 --> 02:35:04.261
I I WILL CONTINUE AS I THINK I

02:35:04.328 --> 02:35:04.862
HAVE RIVER THE MULTIPLE YEARS

02:35:04.928 --> 02:35:06.063
HERE TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT

02:35:06.130 --> 02:35:07.631
WHERE MAYBE AT THEN IT AT THE

02:35:07.698 --> 02:35:10.534
END WE ALL GET SOMETHING WHEN I

02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:12.436
WE HAVE A GOOD BILL.

02:35:12.503 --> 02:35:14.038
I I AND I APPRECIATE THAT OF A

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:15.606
SUMMER GARCIA SO I THINK THAT

02:35:15.673 --> 02:35:16.840
YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE REASON

02:35:16.907 --> 02:35:17.941
WHY THERE'S BEEN THAT THIS IN

02:35:18.008 --> 02:35:18.942
DEPTH CONVERSATION WITH A NUMBER

02:35:19.009 --> 02:35:21.045
OF US BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO

02:35:21.111 --> 02:35:21.612
GET THERE WITH THE ON YOUR

02:35:21.679 --> 02:35:22.579
INTENTION.

02:35:22.646 --> 02:35:24.448
WITHOUT CAUSING TO MUCH ISSUE

02:35:24.515 --> 02:35:25.983
WITH THE PRAGMATIC APPLICATION

02:35:26.050 --> 02:35:28.118
OF IT AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE

02:35:28.185 --> 02:35:29.687
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN.

02:35:29.753 --> 02:35:30.587
RUNNING THESE INTERNSHIP

02:35:30.654 --> 02:35:32.089
PROGRAMS AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:35:32.156 --> 02:35:33.490
SAY OKAY WELL IT THIS IS

02:35:33.557 --> 02:35:36.260
DIRECTION THAT THE ASSEMBLY SOME

02:35:36.326 --> 02:35:37.127
TO GO WITH EVEN WITH THESE

02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:37.995
AMENDMENTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

02:35:38.062 --> 02:35:39.329
THAT THERE'S A WAY TO KIND OF

02:35:39.396 --> 02:35:40.764
TRY TO COME TOGETHER SAY THAT

02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:41.365
THERE ARE SCHOOLS THAT STILL

02:35:41.432 --> 02:35:41.999
NEED.

02:35:42.066 --> 02:35:44.234
THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING

02:35:44.301 --> 02:35:45.669
ENOUGH TEACHERS THE DAY ONE TO

02:35:45.736 --> 02:35:47.438
COME INTO THOSE CLASSROOMS IS

02:35:47.504 --> 02:35:48.505
THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN ALL WORK

02:35:48.572 --> 02:35:50.407
TOGETHER TO CREATE A MORE ROBUST

02:35:50.474 --> 02:35:51.341
PROGRAM.

02:35:51.408 --> 02:35:52.209
THAT PUTS THE NEEDS OF THE

02:35:52.276 --> 02:35:53.911
STUDENTS WHICH IS REALLY WHAT

02:35:53.977 --> 02:35:54.912
IT'S ALL ABOUT CAN WE CREATE A

02:35:54.978 --> 02:35:56.814
MORE ROBUST PROGRAM THAT HAS A

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:58.382
LONGER TERM COMMITMENT.

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:01.285
AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT WERE NOT

02:36:01.351 --> 02:36:06.957
AT LEAST IN THE VERY SHORT TERM

02:36:07.024 --> 02:36:07.524
DISADVANTAGING THESE SCHOOLS

02:36:07.591 --> 02:36:09.193
THAT. FOR WHATEVER REASON AND

02:36:09.259 --> 02:36:09.760
THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF

02:36:09.827 --> 02:36:11.395
REASONS FOR IT ARE RELYING ON ON

02:36:11.462 --> 02:36:14.264
THIS SHORT TERM INTERNSHIP -- TO

02:36:14.331 --> 02:36:16.133
BUILD THEIR CLASSROOMS AND SO.

02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:18.602
THAT'S AND I AND I I I I WILL

02:36:18.669 --> 02:36:19.336
SAY.

02:36:19.403 --> 02:36:20.938
THERE DISADVANTAGED WITH OR

02:36:21.004 --> 02:36:22.740
WITHOUT THIS PART ACTUALLY --

02:36:22.806 --> 02:36:24.942
AND AS WE THINK ABOUT THE SHORT

02:36:25.008 --> 02:36:26.176
TERM I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:36:26.243 --> 02:36:27.911
DON'T GET TO ANOTHER THIRTY

02:36:27.978 --> 02:36:29.012
YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND WE'RE

02:36:29.079 --> 02:36:30.247
SAYING STILL STAYING.

02:36:30.314 --> 02:36:31.448
AWAY WE HAVEN'T REALLY FIX THE

02:36:31.515 --> 02:36:33.550
TEACHER SHORTAGE PROBLEM ARE WE

02:36:33.617 --> 02:36:34.218
HAVING GIVEN OUR TEACHERS ENOUGH

02:36:34.284 --> 02:36:35.786
SUPPORT THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS

02:36:35.853 --> 02:36:36.854
TO BE HAPPENING IN THIS

02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:38.322
DISCUSSION THE COMMITTEE.

02:36:38.388 --> 02:36:39.857
YOU HAVE LEADERS HERE HAVE BEEN

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:41.825
PART OF THOSE SOLUTIONS FOR FOR

02:36:41.892 --> 02:36:43.293
MANY YEARS SINCE IS ONCE.

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:44.728
ADDITIONAL LAYER TO THE

02:36:44.795 --> 02:36:46.430
DISCUSSION THAT HAS BEEN HAD --

02:36:46.497 --> 02:36:48.632
ENTERTAIN HERE AND SO I AGREE

02:36:48.699 --> 02:36:51.001
WITH YOU THAT DISCUSSES THE DO

02:36:51.068 --> 02:36:53.137
CONTINUE ON BOTH SIDES -- IT'S

02:36:53.203 --> 02:36:54.571
Y. TOOK SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS

02:36:54.638 --> 02:36:56.874
IN THIS COMMITTEE -- IT'S WHY I

02:36:56.940 --> 02:36:57.541
GUESS HAVE MULTIPLE COMMITTEES

02:36:57.608 --> 02:36:58.776
TO GO THROUGH AND AND PART OF

02:36:58.842 --> 02:37:00.978
THAT PROCESS AND SEND THE SAME

02:37:01.044 --> 02:37:01.812
WAY THAT I'VE TAKEN FROM

02:37:01.879 --> 02:37:03.614
SUBSTANTIVE A AMENDMENTS I WANT

02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:05.182
TO MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE I

02:37:05.249 --> 02:37:05.883
WANTED TO COMMIT TO ANY

02:37:05.949 --> 02:37:07.084
ADDITIONAL STUFF THAT I HAVE

02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:08.786
COMMITMENT FROM.

02:37:08.852 --> 02:37:09.353
THE OTHER SIDE THAT SOME OF

02:37:09.419 --> 02:37:11.021
THESE AMENDMENTS AND SOME OF THE

02:37:11.088 --> 02:37:12.723
ACTION IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:13.323
AND I'VE MONSTER I THINK THE

02:37:13.390 --> 02:37:14.725
LONGER TERM COMMITMENT IS

02:37:14.792 --> 02:37:15.793
SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT'S

02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:17.795
REALLY A PIPELINE I THINK THAT

02:37:17.861 --> 02:37:19.396
EVERYONE SHOULD AGREE.

02:37:19.463 --> 02:37:20.597
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET

02:37:20.664 --> 02:37:21.865
THERE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:37:21.932 --> 02:37:23.367
WERE SOME OF THE THIRD PARTY

02:37:23.433 --> 02:37:24.401
FOLKSY.

02:37:24.468 --> 02:37:25.569
TO COME TO THE TABLE BUT WITH

02:37:25.636 --> 02:37:27.738
YOU AND WITH OTHERS UP EDUCATION

02:37:27.805 --> 02:37:28.705

02:37:38.048 --> 02:37:39.249
HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT.

02:37:39.316 --> 02:37:41.118
THIS BILL GOING FORWARD I THINK

02:37:41.185 --> 02:37:43.687

THIS AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR

02:38:05.943 --> 02:38:07.611
EXPECTATIONS OF OTHERS TO BE

02:38:07.678 --> 02:38:09.279
ABLE TO COME BOARD AS WELL AND

02:38:09.346 --> 02:38:10.647

THE SHORTER DRAMA.

02:38:21.792 --> 02:38:22.326
YET WE'RE DEALING WITH A LONG

02:38:22.392 --> 02:38:24.394

SUPPORT THE BILL BUT RIGHT NOW I

02:38:28.065 --> 02:38:30.200
WANT TO VOTE FOR IT -- BUT WHEN

02:38:30.267 --> 02:38:31.468
IT GETS THE FLOOR I THINK A LOT

02:38:31.535 --> 02:38:32.703
OF THOUGHT OF THINGS A LOT OF

02:38:32.769 --> 02:38:33.704
CONVERSATIONS FROM ALL SIDES

02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:35.639
NEED TO HAPPEN AND I'LL BE

02:38:35.706 --> 02:38:41.144
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT LOUD AND

02:38:45.482 --> 02:38:45.616
FEW.

02:38:45.682 --> 02:38:47.351
QUESTIONS BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS

02:38:47.417 --> 02:38:49.486
A COMPLICATED TOUGH ISSUES ARE

02:38:49.553 --> 02:38:50.854
TAKING THE MOST AMOUNT OF TIME

02:38:50.921 --> 02:38:52.055
ON THIS BILL OF ALL THE BILLS

02:38:52.122 --> 02:38:53.423
TODAY THERE'S A BIG LINE OUT

02:38:53.490 --> 02:38:53.657
THERE.

02:38:53.724 --> 02:38:55.325
I THINK THERE ARE TWO ISSUES

02:38:55.392 --> 02:38:57.227
THAT THAT THAT -- WERE THAT

02:38:57.294 --> 02:38:58.695
TERROR ADDRESSES THAT ONE WE

02:38:58.762 --> 02:39:01.999
HAVE THIS REAL TEACHER SHORTAGE

02:39:02.065 --> 02:39:03.433
I KNOW EVERY YEAR.

02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:04.835
IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE RE

02:39:04.902 --> 02:39:06.103
OVERSEAS SCHOOL FUNDING.

02:39:06.169 --> 02:39:07.738
WHEN THAT COMMISSION ON TEACHER

02:39:07.804 --> 02:39:08.639
CREDENTIALING COMES AND GIVES

02:39:08.705 --> 02:39:10.340
THE RIVER THERE UPDATE ON THE

02:39:10.407 --> 02:39:11.441
NUMBER OF?

02:39:11.508 --> 02:39:13.176
EMERGENCY CREDENTIAL TEACHERS I

02:39:13.243 --> 02:39:14.978
THINK IT'S RELATIVELY STABLE I

02:39:15.045 --> 02:39:18.415
THINK IT'S THOUSANDS RIGHT SIX

02:39:18.482 --> 02:39:19.416
THOUSAND SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:39:19.483 --> 02:39:21.051
AND SO THAT'S REAL ON THOSE ARE

02:39:21.118 --> 02:39:23.053
KIDS THAT ARE IN CLASSROOMS WITH

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:24.755
TEACHERS THAT ARE NOT PROPERLY

02:39:24.821 --> 02:39:26.857
PREPARED THEY SOME OF THEM HAVE

02:39:26.924 --> 02:39:29.192
SUBSTITUTES FOR DAY ON DAY IN

02:39:29.259 --> 02:39:30.027
DAY IN DAY [inaudible]

02:39:30.093 --> 02:39:33.630
ON ON MONTHS AND SO.

02:39:33.697 --> 02:39:36.033
AND THEN THE SO WE KNOW ABOUT

02:39:36.099 --> 02:39:36.667
THE TEACHERS WERE IS OBVIOUS YOU

02:39:36.733 --> 02:39:38.068
ARE NOT COMPENSATING TEACHERS

02:39:38.135 --> 02:39:38.969
ENOUGH.

02:39:39.036 --> 02:39:40.804
IT'S HARD TO BE A TEACHER.

02:39:40.871 --> 02:39:43.040
AND STRESSFUL POSITION MR

02:39:43.106 --> 02:39:45.008

02:39:45.075 --> 02:39:49.046
TIME -- YEAH.

02:39:49.112 --> 02:39:51.415
AND THE THE THE FLIP SIDE IS

02:39:51.481 --> 02:39:53.116
THAT -- IN SOME OF THESE HIGH

02:39:53.183 --> 02:39:56.987
POVERTY SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS.

02:39:57.054 --> 02:39:57.888
IT'S JUST TOUGH FOR THE KIDS AT

02:39:57.955 --> 02:39:59.890
THE THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST

02:39:59.957 --> 02:40:01.725
THEM.

02:40:01.792 --> 02:40:03.427
IN THEIR IN THEIR HOME.

02:40:03.493 --> 02:40:05.028
IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:40:05.095 --> 02:40:06.897
HEALTHCARE JUST THEIR LIGHTS AND

02:40:06.964 --> 02:40:08.465
THEN THEY'RE IN SCHOOLS WITHOUT

02:40:08.532 --> 02:40:12.469
ADEQUATELY -- TRAIN TEACHERS AND

02:40:12.536 --> 02:40:13.770
AND THOSE ARE THE SCHOOLS THAT

02:40:13.837 --> 02:40:15.138
HAVE.

02:40:15.205 --> 02:40:17.374
THE THIS ISSUE AND SO I I

02:40:17.441 --> 02:40:18.809
UNDERSTAND -- WHERE YOU'RE

02:40:18.875 --> 02:40:20.610

02:40:20.677 --> 02:40:22.446
BALANCE THOSE THOSE ISSUES SO I

02:40:22.512 --> 02:40:23.981
I I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS

02:40:24.047 --> 02:40:25.082

DISTRICTS DO FOR THE TWO YEAR.

02:43:11.948 --> 02:43:13.583
COMMITMENT AND SO THEY WOULD

02:43:13.650 --> 02:43:14.918

02:47:44.154 --> 02:47:46.723
OF PLACEMENT STRATEGY SENSE OUR

02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:48.558

02:47:48.625 --> 02:47:50.093
COMMUNITIES AND THE STUDENTS

02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:51.327
THAT WE SERVE RATHER THERE IN

02:47:51.394 --> 02:47:52.562
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

02:47:52.629 --> 02:47:54.230

DON'T THINK WE HAVE A PARTICULAR

02:48:01.271 --> 02:48:03.106
PREFERENCE IN TERMS OF CHARTER

02:48:03.173 --> 02:48:04.641
VERSUS THAT TRADITIONAL PUBLIC

02:48:04.707 --> 02:48:05.408

DISTRICTS THAT WE PLACE IN HAVE

02:48:22.759 --> 02:48:24.527
MORE SCHOOLS THAN THE CHARTER

02:48:24.594 --> 02:48:25.795
SCHOOL SO IT'S PRETTY EVEN THAT

02:48:25.862 --> 02:48:27.697
IS THE GOAL. TO SERVE ALL OF THE

02:48:27.764 --> 02:48:29.766

TODAY I THINK THERE ARE SOME

02:49:00.196 --> 02:49:01.431
ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO KEEP

02:49:01.498 --> 02:49:03.466
SORTING OUT THE NINE I'M GLAD

02:49:03.533 --> 02:49:04.601

THANK THANK THE CHAIR OF THE

02:49:07.003 --> 02:49:09.038
COMMITTEE FOR CLARIFYING THIS IS

02:49:09.105 --> 02:49:11.674
A TYPE OF INDUCTION OF TEACHERS

02:49:11.741 --> 02:49:13.309
NOT NECESSARILY A BRAND I THINK

02:49:13.376 --> 02:49:16.212
THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL -- BUT

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:18.448
ALSO -- AS MISTER KALRA

02:49:18.515 --> 02:49:21.184
MENTIONED YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR

02:49:21.251 --> 02:49:23.152
SOME OF OUR SOME DISTRICTS ARE

02:49:23.219 --> 02:49:25.154
ALMOST ALL TITLE ONE AND THERE

02:49:25.221 --> 02:49:27.357
IS A VALUE IN IN THESE TYPE OF

02:49:27.423 --> 02:49:28.925
OF EFFORTS AND SO.

02:49:28.992 --> 02:49:30.326
YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF

02:49:30.393 --> 02:49:31.928
FLEXIBILITY OF GOING FORWARD TO

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:34.030
TO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE NONE IN

02:49:34.097 --> 02:49:35.231
TITLE ONE EVEN WITH A FIVE YEAR

02:49:35.298 --> 02:49:43.473
COMMITMENT BUT SOME TYPE OF LIKE

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:44.440
A RATIO IS AT ALL UNDER

02:49:44.507 --> 02:49:46.276
CONSIDERATION.

02:49:46.342 --> 02:49:47.544
I DON'T KNOW THE TWO THINGS THAT

02:49:47.610 --> 02:49:48.678
HAVE TO BE WOULD NEED TO HAPPEN

02:49:48.745 --> 02:49:50.513
THE FEASIBILITY OF A RATIO OR

02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:51.781
HOW WE TRACK THAT I MEAN YOU'RE

02:49:51.848 --> 02:49:52.415
ALREADY ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:49:52.482 --> 02:49:53.950
THE AND WE USE AND HOW WE KEEP

02:49:54.017 --> 02:49:54.717
THAT ACCOUNTABLE.

02:49:54.784 --> 02:49:56.319
AND SAYS THAT AT A LATER THAT

02:49:56.386 --> 02:49:58.555
KIND OF MAKES AN UNWORKABLE SO

02:49:58.621 --> 02:49:59.756
I'M NOT SAYING NO BUT IT IT IN

02:49:59.822 --> 02:50:00.323
THOSE QUESTIONS NEED TO BE

02:50:00.390 --> 02:50:01.190
ANSWERED AND FOR ME ALONG THE

02:50:01.257 --> 02:50:01.624
WAY.

02:50:01.691 --> 02:50:03.159
AND TO IF I'M GOING TO GO DOWN

02:50:03.226 --> 02:50:05.328
THAT PATHWAY I NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:50:05.395 --> 02:50:06.696
THAT IN THE COULD THE FIVE YEAR

02:50:06.763 --> 02:50:10.366
COMMITMENT -- IS.

02:50:10.433 --> 02:50:11.935
IS IMPORTANT KEEPING THOSE

02:50:12.001 --> 02:50:12.769
DOLLARS IN THE SCHOOLS IT'S

02:50:12.835 --> 02:50:13.903
IMPORTANT THAT ARE PART OF THE

02:50:13.970 --> 02:50:14.771
SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS THAT

02:50:14.837 --> 02:50:15.572
WE'VE TAKEN.

02:50:15.638 --> 02:50:17.941
TODAY FROM THE OPPOSITION AND SO

02:50:18.007 --> 02:50:19.943
I THINK AT THIS POINT IN THE

02:50:20.009 --> 02:50:20.743
DISCUSSION I CAN'T SAY NO TO

02:50:20.810 --> 02:50:23.613
ANYTHING -- BUT IF YOU KNOW WHEN

02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:24.347
IT'S RIGHT WHAT ARE THE

02:50:24.414 --> 02:50:26.916
CONSEQUENCES AND AND IN DOING SO.

02:50:26.983 --> 02:50:28.351
ARE WE GETTING TO THE GOAL OF A

02:50:28.418 --> 02:50:32.422
WITH THE BILL. ONE AMPS DO.

02:50:32.488 --> 02:50:32.722
THANK YOU.

02:50:32.789 --> 02:50:35.358
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

02:50:35.425 --> 02:50:37.527
THANK YOU A DOCTOR YES I I I I

02:50:37.594 --> 02:50:40.296
APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION --

02:50:40.363 --> 02:50:43.433
OBVIOUSLY IT BUT BRINGS TO OF

02:50:43.499 --> 02:50:45.201
FOR A NUMBER OF CRITICAL ISSUES

02:50:45.268 --> 02:50:46.970
WITH REGARDS TO EDUCATION AND

02:50:47.036 --> 02:50:48.771
PLACEMENT OF TEACHERS IN

02:50:48.838 --> 02:50:50.206
CLASSROOMS AND THOSE KINDS OF

02:50:50.273 --> 02:50:50.974
THINGS AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:51.808
THAT.

02:50:51.874 --> 02:50:54.243
YOU AND I OVER THE YEARS -- YEAH

02:50:54.310 --> 02:50:55.745
I THINK.

02:50:55.812 --> 02:50:57.080
IT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE

02:50:57.146 --> 02:50:58.414
TEACH FOR AMERICA'S BRAND IS OUT

02:50:58.481 --> 02:51:00.149
THERE AT THIS POINT AND SO I

02:51:00.216 --> 02:51:01.451
THINK THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT.

02:51:01.517 --> 02:51:02.919
NECESSARILY TO DEAL WITH THAT

02:51:02.986 --> 02:51:04.387
BUT TO DEAL WITH THE QUESTION OF

02:51:04.454 --> 02:51:06.155
PLACEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS IN

02:51:06.222 --> 02:51:08.358
SCHOOLS AND I THINK OF THOSE OF

02:51:08.424 --> 02:51:09.826
YOU FROM IN DOUBLY C. P. AND

02:51:09.892 --> 02:51:10.727
OTHERS WHO HAVE THE RESEARCH

02:51:10.793 --> 02:51:11.327
KNOW.

02:51:11.394 --> 02:51:11.861
THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST

02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:14.163
CHALLENGES AT MOST SCHOOLS HAVE

02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:16.299
SOMEONE HAVE GENERALLY THAT ARE --

02:51:16.366 --> 02:51:18.501
LOW INCOME OF SCHOOLS TITLE ONE

02:51:18.568 --> 02:51:19.736
SCHOOLS IS SHE MENTALLY

02:51:19.802 --> 02:51:21.537
CHALLENGED SCHOOLS HAVE MOST OF

02:51:21.604 --> 02:51:23.006
THE NEW TEACHERS THE

02:51:23.072 --> 02:51:24.240
INEXPERIENCED TEACHERS WHETHER

02:51:24.307 --> 02:51:24.607
THERE.

02:51:24.674 --> 02:51:26.242
IS A BE FORTY FOUR AMERICA THIS

02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:27.677
IS DURING TEACH FOR AMERICA NO

02:51:27.744 --> 02:51:29.779
BE ACTED TEACH FOR AMERICA --

02:51:29.846 --> 02:51:30.880
AND THAT'S THE ONGOING

02:51:30.947 --> 02:51:33.449
CHALLENGES THE PLACEMENT AND AS

02:51:33.516 --> 02:51:34.917
HAVING BEEN A SCHOOL BOARD

02:51:34.984 --> 02:51:36.519
MEMBER WITH THE AND NUMBER TITLE

02:51:36.586 --> 02:51:38.021
ONE SCHOOLS I SOMETIMES MUST

02:51:38.087 --> 02:51:39.555
DISTRICTS HAD MY SCHOOL

02:51:39.622 --> 02:51:40.757
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS HAD AS HIGH

02:51:40.823 --> 02:51:42.258
AS 70%.

02:51:42.325 --> 02:51:44.193
BRAND NEW TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL.

02:51:44.260 --> 02:51:45.595
OF LOW INCOME KIDS WERE REALLY

02:51:45.662 --> 02:51:47.664
CHALLENGED AND YOU CAN IMAGINE

02:51:47.730 --> 02:51:49.165
THERE'S NOT ONLY THEIR THOSE

02:51:49.232 --> 02:51:49.766
TEACHERS ARE TRYING TO LEARN

02:51:49.832 --> 02:51:52.001
WITH THE BEST THAT THEY CAN PUT

02:51:52.068 --> 02:51:54.437
TOGETHER A AS AS AS NEW TEACHERS.

02:51:54.504 --> 02:51:55.538
BUT THERE'S NO THEY'RE VERY FROM

02:51:55.605 --> 02:51:57.140
ROLE MODELS AT THAT SCHOOL IN

02:51:57.206 --> 02:51:58.574
TERMS OF EXPERIENCED TEACHERS

02:51:58.641 --> 02:52:00.643
WHO CAN HELP WHERE ACROSS

02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:02.378
INTERSTATE EIGHT YOU KNOW THERE

02:52:02.445 --> 02:52:04.147
ARE HOLES THE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES

02:52:04.213 --> 02:52:05.381
WITH THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF YEARS

02:52:05.448 --> 02:52:07.350
IS TEN FIFTEEN YEARS IN SCHOOL.

02:52:07.417 --> 02:52:08.484
AND WHEN YOU BRING IN A NEW

02:52:08.551 --> 02:52:10.420
TEACHER THEY HAVE WON FIVE

02:52:10.486 --> 02:52:12.288
MENTORS TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT

02:52:12.355 --> 02:52:13.589
THE CURRICULUM DO CLASSROOM

02:52:13.656 --> 02:52:15.024
MANAGEMENT AND ALL THOSE THINGS

02:52:15.091 --> 02:52:16.426
THAT NEW TEACHERS STRUGGLE WITH.

02:52:16.492 --> 02:52:18.461
SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH IS IS REALLY

02:52:18.528 --> 02:52:20.129
THE ISSUE OF PLACEMENT.

02:52:20.196 --> 02:52:22.098
AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE --

02:52:22.165 --> 02:52:24.100
THAT WE OFTEN PUT OUR NEW AS OUR

02:52:24.167 --> 02:52:25.201
NEW TEACHERS NO MATTER HOW

02:52:25.268 --> 02:52:26.335
ENERGETIC THEY ARE THEY GOING TO

02:52:26.402 --> 02:52:26.869
CHILD THE CHALLENGE WITH

02:52:26.936 --> 02:52:28.671
MANAGING CURRICULUM AND CLASS

02:52:28.738 --> 02:52:30.440
MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION AND

02:52:30.506 --> 02:52:31.307
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:52:31.374 --> 02:52:32.675
AND ISN'T TAKEN TWO THREE FOUR

02:52:32.742 --> 02:52:34.077
YEARS TO BECOME GOOD ENOUGH TO

02:52:34.143 --> 02:52:35.511
DEAL WITH IT IN THE IN THE

02:52:35.578 --> 02:52:37.980
MEANWHILE YOU'VE GOT KIDS

02:52:38.047 --> 02:52:44.787
SIGNALS CLASSROOMS WITH FOR

02:52:44.854 --> 02:52:46.422
YEARS.

02:52:46.489 --> 02:52:47.090
THE ONE CLASSROOM TO THE NEXT IF

02:52:47.156 --> 02:52:47.957
YOU HAVE A LOT OF BRAND NEW

02:52:48.024 --> 02:52:48.524
TEACHERS AT THE SCHOOL WILL

02:52:48.591 --> 02:52:49.092
GOING TO BE THE VICTIMS OF

02:52:49.158 --> 02:52:49.525
WHATEVER HAPPENS NOT

02:52:49.592 --> 02:52:49.892
INTENTIONALLY.

02:52:49.959 --> 02:52:50.493
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT'S THE

02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:51.060
NATURE OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING

02:52:51.127 --> 02:52:51.627
WITH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE

02:52:51.694 --> 02:52:51.861
ENOUGH.

02:52:51.928 --> 02:52:53.129
EXPERIENCE TEACHERS IN THOSE

02:52:53.196 --> 02:52:55.231
SCHOOLS TO INTERVENE TO SUPPORT

02:52:55.298 --> 02:52:56.399
AS WELL AS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO

02:52:56.466 --> 02:52:58.101
BE IN THOSE CLASSES AT SOME

02:52:58.167 --> 02:52:59.569
POINT YOU'RE GOING TO ALWAYS IN

02:52:59.635 --> 02:53:01.003
A WITH THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE.

02:53:01.070 --> 02:53:02.972
SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE

02:53:03.039 --> 02:53:04.340
LOOK AT IT I'M I'M.

02:53:04.407 --> 02:53:06.476
I I I'M CONCERNED A LITTLE BIT

02:53:06.542 --> 02:53:07.877
ABOUT THE LANGUAGE AND WILL WORK

02:53:07.944 --> 02:53:08.911
ON THAT BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT SURE

02:53:08.978 --> 02:53:09.812
IF THIS IS THE ISSUE OF

02:53:09.879 --> 02:53:12.782
CONTRACTING OUT CONTRACTING IT.

02:53:12.849 --> 02:53:13.616
IN MY MIND IT'S A MATTER OF

02:53:13.683 --> 02:53:14.584
PLACEMENT.

02:53:14.650 --> 02:53:16.252
AND A MATTER OF COMMITMENT --

02:53:16.319 --> 02:53:17.687
AND I KNOW OVER THE YEARS I'VE

02:53:17.754 --> 02:53:19.422
I'VE BASICALLY SAID WE SHOULD

02:53:19.489 --> 02:53:22.158
NEVER HAVE A A LARGER PERCENTAGE

02:53:22.225 --> 02:53:23.826
OF NEW TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL

02:53:23.893 --> 02:53:25.094
LARGER THAN WHAT THE DISTRICT

02:53:25.161 --> 02:53:25.795
PASS.

02:53:25.862 --> 02:53:27.196
SO THE DISTRICT HAS 10% NEW

02:53:27.263 --> 02:53:28.631
TEACHERS THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE

02:53:28.698 --> 02:53:30.733
THAN 10% NEW TEACHERS AT A POOR

02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:31.701
SCHOOL.

02:53:31.768 --> 02:53:32.535
BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED

02:53:32.602 --> 02:53:33.703
AROUND AT THAT OF COURSE BRINGS

02:53:33.770 --> 02:53:35.004
HEARTBREAK TO PEOPLE BECAUSE

02:53:35.071 --> 02:53:36.472
THAT MEANS SOME PEOPLE MAY BE

02:53:36.539 --> 02:53:37.740
MOVED FROM SCHOOL IF YOU'RE

02:53:37.807 --> 02:53:38.941
COMFORTABLE WITH BUT YET THEY'RE

02:53:39.008 --> 02:53:40.042
VERY EXPERIENCE AND THEY NEED TO

02:53:40.109 --> 02:53:41.277
GO SOME PLACE TO HELP.

02:53:41.344 --> 02:53:42.879
OUT WITH WHAT'S GOING ON SO I

02:53:42.945 --> 02:53:44.313
THINK THIS IS THE GIVES TO ISSUE

02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:45.615
BUT WE WHAT KIND OF STARTING

02:53:45.681 --> 02:53:47.383
AROUND IT IN TERMS OF TALKING

02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:48.151
ABOUT.

02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:50.286
TEACH FOR AMERICA AND ALL THAT

02:53:50.353 --> 02:53:51.921
WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IN

02:53:51.988 --> 02:53:53.589
EXPERIENCED TEACHERS NOT HAVING

02:53:53.656 --> 02:53:54.891
THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT THEY

02:53:54.957 --> 02:53:57.226
NEED TO BE AFFECTED AND BEING SO

02:53:57.293 --> 02:53:59.095
MANY OF THEM IN ONE SCHOOL.

02:53:59.162 --> 02:54:00.229
THAT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT WITH

02:54:00.296 --> 02:54:01.731
IT BECAUSE IF YOU GOT TEACH FOR

02:54:01.798 --> 02:54:02.365
AMERICA IN THE AND THEN YOU IF

02:54:02.431 --> 02:54:03.166
YOU'RE A POOR SCHOOL YOU

02:54:03.232 --> 02:54:04.767
PROBABLY HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF

02:54:04.834 --> 02:54:06.035
THOSE THAT ARE NOT TEACH FOR

02:54:06.102 --> 02:54:06.435
AMERICA.

02:54:06.502 --> 02:54:07.036
YOU CAN'T HAVE TO TEACH FOR

02:54:07.103 --> 02:54:07.637
AMERICA FOLKS BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:54:07.703 --> 02:54:08.204
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

02:54:08.271 --> 02:54:09.972
GOING ON AND SO WE HAVE THE

02:54:10.039 --> 02:54:11.941
SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT WOULD

02:54:12.008 --> 02:54:13.876
LARGE NUMBERS OF BRANDY TEACHERS.

02:54:13.943 --> 02:54:14.811
NOW WOULD NEVER BANNED BRENDA

02:54:14.877 --> 02:54:15.578
TEACHERS BECAUSE THEY BRING

02:54:15.645 --> 02:54:17.580
ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM INTO A

02:54:17.647 --> 02:54:18.881
SCHOOL BUT SOMETIMES THE OTHERS

02:54:18.948 --> 02:54:19.949
DON'T BRING.

02:54:20.016 --> 02:54:21.417
BUT THEY ALSO NEED MORE THAN

02:54:21.484 --> 02:54:22.718
JUST INCLUDES THE AS MAY NEED

02:54:22.785 --> 02:54:24.587
TRAINING I MEAN IT'S SUPPORT ON

02:54:24.654 --> 02:54:25.288
HOW TO BECOME AN EFFECTIVE

02:54:25.354 --> 02:54:28.291
TEACHER AND SO -- I'M OF SUPPORT

02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:29.192
IS NOT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WHEN

02:54:29.258 --> 02:54:30.359
YOU'VE COMMITTED TO CARRYING ON

02:54:30.426 --> 02:54:32.094
THE THE CONVERSATION BUT IT IS

02:54:32.161 --> 02:54:33.429
AN ISSUE THAT IS CRITICAL THAT

02:54:33.496 --> 02:54:35.531
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE RESEARCH

02:54:35.598 --> 02:54:36.332
BEARS OUT.

02:54:36.399 --> 02:54:38.434
THAT WE SHOULD BASICALLY BE

02:54:38.501 --> 02:54:39.602
DISTRIBUTING ARCS TEACHERS

02:54:39.669 --> 02:54:42.205
ACROSS THE BOARD WITH WITH XP

02:54:42.271 --> 02:54:43.439
BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND

02:54:43.506 --> 02:54:45.074
EXPERIENCE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN

02:54:45.141 --> 02:54:47.143
ACTUALLY TEACH THE STUDENTS HAVE

02:54:47.210 --> 02:54:48.811
SOME MENTORS SOME SUPPORT AS

02:54:48.878 --> 02:54:49.812
WELL AS THE OTHER KIND OF

02:54:49.879 --> 02:54:51.180
STRUCTURES THAT HELP PEOPLE

02:54:51.247 --> 02:54:51.414
BECOME.

02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:53.549
EFFECTIVE TEACHERS EVEN IN OUR

02:54:53.616 --> 02:54:55.585
OWN REGULAR TEACHER POOR WHEN WE

02:54:55.651 --> 02:54:57.186
HAD THE MEETING HERE TALKING

02:54:57.253 --> 02:54:58.054
ABOUT WHY ARE PEOPLE LEAVING THE

02:54:58.120 --> 02:54:58.588
PROFESSION.

02:54:58.654 --> 02:55:00.456
NUMBER ONE ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE

02:55:00.523 --> 02:55:02.892
REASONS ONE OF COURSE IT WAS IT

02:55:02.959 --> 02:55:03.292
ALL.

02:55:03.359 --> 02:55:11.400
MONEY AND SO FOR THIS ONE BUT

02:55:11.467 --> 02:55:12.001
ALSO THERE WAS AFFECTED PEOPLE

02:55:12.068 --> 02:55:13.502
DIDN'T FEEL SUCCESSFUL.

02:55:13.569 --> 02:55:14.070
AND THEY PROBABLY DID FEEL

02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:14.637
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY WERE

02:55:14.704 --> 02:55:15.238
BEING PUT IN SITUATIONS THAT

02:55:15.304 --> 02:55:15.872
THEY FELT THEY WOULD NOT DOING

02:55:15.938 --> 02:55:16.439
THE BEST THEY COULD DO AND

02:55:16.505 --> 02:55:16.873
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

02:55:16.939 --> 02:55:17.506
BECAUSE PROBABLY WITH A LITTLE

02:55:17.573 --> 02:55:18.174
BIT MORE SUPPORT THEY COULD HAVE

02:55:18.241 --> 02:55:18.841
BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUT THEY DIDN'T

02:55:18.908 --> 02:55:19.508
FEEL LIKE THEY WERE DOING A GOOD

02:55:19.575 --> 02:55:20.042
JOB AND SO THEY LEFT THE

02:55:20.109 --> 02:55:20.676
PROFESSION SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED

02:55:20.743 --> 02:55:22.044
BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

02:55:22.111 --> 02:55:23.713
WANT TO BASICALLY MESSEL ANYMORE

02:55:23.779 --> 02:55:24.247
KIDS.

02:55:24.313 --> 02:55:25.414
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND AND

02:55:25.481 --> 02:55:26.983
APPRECIATE THAT SO I I

02:55:27.049 --> 02:55:28.551
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU THE ISSUE

02:55:28.618 --> 02:55:29.485
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

OKAY -- I SEE THAT A A RANDOM

02:57:49.291 --> 02:57:50.593
SURVEY FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN SAID

02:57:50.659 --> 02:57:51.927
THAT A MAJORITY OF SCHOOL

02:57:51.994 --> 02:57:53.529
PRINCIPALS WOULD HIRE TEACH FOR

02:57:53.596 --> 02:57:55.498
AMERICA TEACHERS.

02:57:55.564 --> 02:57:56.632

HOSTILE.

02:58:04.106 --> 02:58:04.707

IMPORTANT AND MISTER CHAIR THIS

02:58:14.683 --> 02:58:15.818
IS ONE THE MOST HOSTILE PIECES

02:58:15.885 --> 02:58:16.952
OF LEGISLATION I'VE SEEN.

02:58:17.019 --> 02:58:18.254
SINCE MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:20.556
SO I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ASK

02:58:20.623 --> 02:58:21.323
QUESTIONS OF THE WITNESS THAT

02:58:21.390 --> 02:58:23.192
GET TO THE CORE MERITS OF THE

02:58:23.259 --> 02:58:24.060
LEGISLATION AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

02:58:24.126 --> 02:58:24.627
DOING.

02:58:24.693 --> 02:58:25.895
NOW DO YOU HAVE REASON TO

02:58:25.961 --> 02:58:26.796
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WRONG THAT

02:58:26.862 --> 02:58:28.998
OVER A MAJORITY OF TEACHERS AND

02:58:29.065 --> 02:58:31.400
CAL OF PRINCIPLES IN CALIFORNIA

02:58:31.467 --> 02:58:31.934
CITY WOULD HIRE TEACH FOR

02:58:32.001 --> 02:58:33.469
AMERICA TEACHERS.

02:58:33.536 --> 02:58:36.405
THESE PRINCIPLES IN AMERICA'S IN

02:58:36.472 --> 02:58:38.240
THE THIRTY PRINTS.

02:58:38.307 --> 02:58:39.809
FEATURES CALIFORNIA PRINCIPLES

02:58:39.875 --> 02:58:40.209
ARE SAYING THIS.

02:58:40.276 --> 02:58:40.843
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A

02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:41.510
GOOD QUESTION IN MY I DON'T KNOW

02:58:41.577 --> 02:58:43.279
THAT'S CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC OR OR

02:58:43.345 --> 02:58:44.447
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT I WOULD

02:58:44.513 --> 02:58:45.648
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CITY AND

02:58:45.714 --> 02:58:47.550
LOOK AT THEIR DATA AND ALSO YOU

02:58:47.616 --> 02:58:48.217
KNOW MAKE SURE THAT I AGREE WITH

02:58:48.284 --> 02:58:50.486
THEIR THEIR METHODOLOGY AND SEND

02:58:50.553 --> 02:58:51.253
THAT.

02:58:51.320 --> 02:58:52.588
PART I CAN SPEAK IF I HAVE THE

02:58:52.655 --> 02:58:53.756
DATE AND FINING ME SURE I HAVE

02:58:53.823 --> 02:58:54.723
THAT MUCH TRAINING BUT CERTAINLY

02:58:54.790 --> 02:58:56.659
WE CAN AGREE THAT AT LEAST SOME

02:58:56.725 --> 02:58:58.928
PRINCIPLES -- HIGHER TEACH FOR

02:58:58.994 --> 02:59:00.029
AMERICA TEACHERS LONG TERM CARE

02:59:00.096 --> 02:59:01.564
HIRING THE NUMBER AS EARLY AS

02:59:01.630 --> 02:59:03.099
OKAY SO WHY IS IT THAT YOU THINK

02:59:03.165 --> 02:59:04.166
THAT WE IS.

02:59:04.233 --> 02:59:05.701
THE STATE GOVERNMENT NO BETTER

02:59:05.768 --> 02:59:09.271
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE SCHOOLS THAN

02:59:09.338 --> 02:59:11.740
THOSE SCHOOL LEADERS.

02:59:11.807 --> 02:59:12.308
YES THEY GOVERNMENT COSTLY

02:59:12.374 --> 02:59:13.342
PASSED LEGISLATION THAT TELLS

02:59:13.409 --> 02:59:14.510
PEOPLE WHAT WE THINK THEY SHOULD

02:59:14.577 --> 02:59:15.144
BE DOING AS A BODY AS A WHOLE.

02:59:15.211 --> 02:59:16.946
OUT THERE AND SO PART OF WHAT WE

02:59:17.012 --> 02:59:18.147
DO IS DISCUSS IT AS THE BODY AND

02:59:18.214 --> 02:59:19.748
TRY TO COME TO A PIECE OF

02:59:19.815 --> 02:59:21.383
LEGISLATION TO GIVE DIRECTION TO

02:59:21.450 --> 02:59:22.585
OUR LEADERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:59:22.651 --> 02:59:24.553
ON A REGULAR BASIS NOT JUST IN

02:59:24.620 --> 02:59:26.522
THE SPACE.

02:59:26.589 --> 02:59:27.723
SURE MAYBE OTHER PIECES OF

02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:28.891
LEGISLATION DO SIMILAR THINGS

02:59:28.958 --> 02:59:30.659
I'M ASKING FOR THIS PARTICULAR

02:59:30.726 --> 02:59:31.694
PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHY DO YOU

02:59:31.760 --> 02:59:34.096
THINK WE AS THE STATE GOVERNOR

02:59:34.163 --> 02:59:34.830
BETTER EQUIPPED.

02:59:34.897 --> 02:59:37.299
THAN SCHOOL LEADERS TO DETERMINE

02:59:37.366 --> 02:59:39.101
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE STUDENTS AT

02:59:39.168 --> 02:59:41.570
THEIR SCHOOLS.

02:59:41.637 --> 02:59:44.673
I'VE I'VE I WOULD SAY THAT.

02:59:44.740 --> 02:59:45.474
INSTANCE WHERE YOU'RE IN THE

02:59:45.541 --> 02:59:46.408
THICK OF THINGS YOU MIGHT HAVE

02:59:46.475 --> 02:59:47.776
TELEVISION AND WE NEED TO STEP

02:59:47.843 --> 02:59:49.678
BACK AND LOOK AT IT AND THAT'S

02:59:49.745 --> 02:59:52.081
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY.

02:59:52.148 --> 02:59:53.048
OKAY SO YOU THINK THAT THE

02:59:53.115 --> 02:59:54.483
SCHOOL LEADERS WHO DECIDE TO

02:59:54.550 --> 02:59:55.985
HIRE TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS.

02:59:56.051 --> 02:59:57.419
ARE NOT MAKING DECISIONS THAT

02:59:57.486 --> 02:59:58.754
ARE BEST FOR THEIR SCHOOLS I

02:59:58.821 --> 03:00:00.122
THINK THE TEETH THE SCHOOL

03:00:00.189 --> 03:00:01.590
LEADERS WHO ARE.

03:00:01.657 --> 03:00:03.425
HIRING WHETHER TEACH FOR AMERICA

03:00:03.492 --> 03:00:04.994
OR OTHER INTERN TEACHERS WOULD

03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:06.028
ALL AGREE THAT WOULD THAT THEY

03:00:06.095 --> 03:00:07.730
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE TEACHER

03:00:07.796 --> 03:00:08.497
THERE FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS.

03:00:08.564 --> 03:00:09.131
OKAY.

03:00:09.198 --> 03:00:09.865
WHICH IS PART OF WHAT WE'RE

03:00:09.932 --> 03:00:11.500
TRYING TO DO HERE TRYING TO MAKE

03:00:11.567 --> 03:00:12.134
SURE WE HAVE A PIPELINE AND WE

03:00:12.201 --> 03:00:13.702
HAVE TO KEEP THESE INDIVIDUALS

03:00:13.769 --> 03:00:14.670
IN THE CLASSROOM.

03:00:14.737 --> 03:00:16.505
PASSED PROFICIENCY SO THAT ONCE

03:00:16.572 --> 03:00:17.473
THEY GET TO THAT LEVEL THEY'RE

03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:20.009
GIVING THAT SKILL SET BACK TO

03:00:20.075 --> 03:00:21.210
THE STUDENTS.

03:00:21.277 --> 03:00:22.378
OKAY SO IT BUT IN IN EACH AND

03:00:22.444 --> 03:00:23.345
EVERY INSTANCE WHERE SCHOOL

03:00:23.412 --> 03:00:24.580
LEADER IN CALIFORNIA HAS DECIDED

03:00:24.647 --> 03:00:25.114
TO PARTNER WITH TEACH FOR

03:00:25.181 --> 03:00:26.415
AMERICA AND HIGHER TEACH FOR

03:00:26.482 --> 03:00:26.949
AMERICA TEACHERS YOU'RE

03:00:27.016 --> 03:00:29.084
CONFIDENT THAT I WAS NOT THE

03:00:29.151 --> 03:00:31.153
RIGHT THING TO DO [inaudible]

03:00:31.220 --> 03:00:31.520
YES [inaudible]

03:00:31.587 --> 03:00:34.957
OKAY.

03:00:35.024 --> 03:00:36.492
DO YOU AYE AYE AS I UNDERSTAND

03:00:36.559 --> 03:00:39.261
YOUR POSITION YOU BELIEVE THAT.

03:00:39.328 --> 03:00:40.596
THE TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS

03:00:40.663 --> 03:00:41.864
BASED UPON THE TRAINING THEY

03:00:41.931 --> 03:00:43.132
RECEIVED ARE NOT.

03:00:43.199 --> 03:00:44.733
CAPABLE OF BEING AFFECTED

03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:45.701
TEACHERS IS THAT RIGHT.

03:00:45.768 --> 03:00:47.169
SOME OF THE MORE YOU HAVE A

03:00:47.236 --> 03:00:48.037
GREAT TEACHER HAIRFINITY HE'S

03:00:48.103 --> 03:00:49.104
BEEN TEAM TEACHER OF THE YEAR

03:00:49.171 --> 03:00:50.072

CONGRATULATIONS ASHLEY.

03:00:51.307 --> 03:00:53.709
SO SOME OF THEM ARE BUT WE HAVE

03:00:53.776 --> 03:00:55.244
85% OF THEM WHO ARE LEAVING.

03:00:55.311 --> 03:00:56.445
MANY OF THEM ARE NOT FINISHING

03:00:56.512 --> 03:00:58.080
EVEN THEIR TWO YEAR CONTRACT

03:00:58.147 --> 03:00:59.048
BECAUSE THEY DECIDED THAT THEY

03:00:59.114 --> 03:01:00.216
WANT.

03:01:00.282 --> 03:01:01.317
TO LEAVE A YEAR EARLIER BECAUSE

03:01:01.383 --> 03:01:02.418
IT WASN'T FOR THEM.

03:01:02.484 --> 03:01:04.954
OUT THERE AND SO IT'S NOT A 100%

EMPLOYMENT TYPE PROGRAMS THAT WE

03:05:01.857 --> 03:05:03.158

NEGOTIATED IN THE LOCAL DISTRICT

03:07:23.498 --> 03:07:24.833
MO YOU CONTRACT IT WOULD NOT BE

03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:27.235
SOMETHING THAT TO AN ANIMAL OF

03:07:27.302 --> 03:07:28.804
THE STATE -- NOT ACCURATE

03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:30.639
ACTUALLY THE STATE GOVERNMENT

03:07:30.706 --> 03:07:32.874
ACTUALLY ACT REQUIRES THAT IS

03:07:32.941 --> 03:07:34.643
BEING NEGOTIATED YOUR LINE OF

03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:36.712
QUESTIONING SO IT IS CUT OFF

03:07:36.778 --> 03:07:38.647
LET'S GO GET IT IS CORRECT THAT

03:07:38.714 --> 03:07:39.281
THAT IS TO GO SHE HATED -- AT

03:07:39.348 --> 03:07:40.415
THE DISTRICT LEVEL BUT THE

03:07:40.482 --> 03:07:42.050
REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A PROVISION

03:07:42.117 --> 03:07:43.952
RELATING TO CRESSMAN IS PRODUCT

03:07:44.019 --> 03:07:45.587
OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT CODE.

03:07:45.654 --> 03:07:46.722
SO -- THERE'VE BEEN A TIMES IN

03:07:46.788 --> 03:07:48.323
THIS LEGISLATURE TO ACTUALLY

03:07:48.390 --> 03:07:51.059
CHANGE THAT PROVISION OF THE

03:07:51.126 --> 03:07:53.962
STATE GOVERNMENT HAD. TO CHANGE

03:07:54.029 --> 03:07:55.297
THE SORT OF A SENIORITY BUMPING

03:07:55.364 --> 03:07:57.265
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE MOST

03:07:57.332 --> 03:07:58.734
EXPERIENCED TEACHERS GIVEN

03:07:58.800 --> 03:08:00.268
PREFERENCE WHERE TO GO AND AND

03:08:00.335 --> 03:08:01.470
YOU KNOW MORE OFTEN THAN NOT

03:08:01.536 --> 03:08:03.739
GOING AWAY FROM THE LOW INCOME

03:08:03.805 --> 03:08:04.873
SCHOOL SO WOULD YOU.

03:08:04.940 --> 03:08:07.809
COMMIT TO AMENDING THE BILL --

03:08:07.876 --> 03:08:08.644
TO TRY TO DO AWAY WITH THE SORT

03:08:08.710 --> 03:08:10.445
OF SENIORITY BUMPING PRACTICES

03:08:10.512 --> 03:08:19.221
TO GET YOUR CONCERN HAVING MORE

03:08:19.287 --> 03:08:19.855
EXPERIENCED TEACHERS LOW INCOME

03:08:19.921 --> 03:08:20.656
SCHOOLS [inaudible]

03:08:20.722 --> 03:08:21.623
NO [inaudible]

03:08:21.690 --> 03:08:22.491
OKAY.

03:08:22.557 --> 03:08:23.959
DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD NOT BE

03:08:24.026 --> 03:08:24.559
AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DEAL WITH

03:08:24.626 --> 03:08:25.093
THIS CONCERN.

03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:25.861
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE

03:08:25.927 --> 03:08:26.695
PURPOSE OF MY BILL AT THIS VERY

03:08:26.762 --> 03:08:27.996
MOMENT IN BRINGING LIGHT.

03:08:28.063 --> 03:08:28.530
I TO A PRACTICE THAT MIGHT

03:08:28.597 --> 03:08:29.698
INCLUDE THAT RELATE TO THAT --

03:08:29.765 --> 03:08:30.666
DISCUSSION BUT I'M NOT GOING TO

03:08:30.732 --> 03:08:32.100
COMMIT TO COMPLETELY CHANGE HIM

03:08:32.167 --> 03:08:38.473
A BILL TO PLEASE -- YOU TODAY AT

03:08:38.540 --> 03:08:39.474
SENDING YOU AND I COULD DISCUSS

03:08:39.541 --> 03:08:40.776
AT A LATER TIME ALL RIGHT THANK

03:08:40.842 --> 03:08:43.779
YOU VERY MUCH.

03:08:43.845 --> 03:08:45.847
I HAVE ABOUT ONE OTHER AREA SO

03:08:45.914 --> 03:08:46.782
THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION

03:08:46.848 --> 03:08:48.717
ABOUT DIFFERENT STUDIES AND I

03:08:48.784 --> 03:08:50.118
KNOW BOTH SIDES PRESENT

03:08:50.185 --> 03:08:51.820
CONFLICTING ARE TO SOME EXTENT

03:08:51.887 --> 03:08:55.023
CONFLICTING -- DATA AS TO

03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:55.957
TEACHER PERFORMANCE DO WE HAVE

03:08:56.024 --> 03:08:57.726
ANY DATA AS FAR AS THE

03:08:57.793 --> 03:08:59.361
PERFORMANCE OF TSA BAY TEACHERS

03:08:59.428 --> 03:09:01.596
VERSES THE PERFORMANCE OF LONG

03:09:01.663 --> 03:09:06.702
TERM SUBSTITUTES.

03:09:06.768 --> 03:09:09.738
SO THE WINNER DRAWING HAMMOND

03:09:09.805 --> 03:09:11.907
STUDY FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE WE

03:09:11.973 --> 03:09:13.375
LOOK THAT AND NOT EASILY

03:09:13.442 --> 03:09:16.278
SUBSTITUTES BUT UNCERTIFIED

03:09:16.344 --> 03:09:17.879
TEACHERS WHO COULD BE IN THAT --

03:09:17.946 --> 03:09:22.050
GROUP -- AND TFA PERFORM

03:09:22.117 --> 03:09:23.919
SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE AND

03:09:23.985 --> 03:09:25.554
CERTIFIED TEACHERS BUT NOT

03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:27.022
BETTER THAN THE CERTIFIED

03:09:27.089 --> 03:09:28.156
EXPERIENCED TEACHERS.

03:09:28.223 --> 03:09:30.959
BUT I THINK THE KEY THERE IS

03:09:31.026 --> 03:09:31.993
THAT.

03:09:32.060 --> 03:09:34.229
CHOOSING BATTLE WORSE IS THE

03:09:34.296 --> 03:09:37.365
ENEMY OF GOOD.

03:09:37.432 --> 03:09:39.334
OKAY BUT YEAH IT SOUNDS LIKE

03:09:39.401 --> 03:09:40.368
YOU'VE SORT OF ACCEPT WHAT IS MY

03:09:40.435 --> 03:09:42.204
IMPLICIT PROMISE -- THAT -- IF

03:09:42.270 --> 03:09:43.972
YOU YOU SIMPLY SAY WE CAN'T HAVE

03:09:44.039 --> 03:09:45.474
TFA ANYMORE THAT THERE WILL BE

03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:47.609
MORE LONG TERM SUBS PLACED IN

03:09:47.676 --> 03:09:50.679
SCHOOLS.

03:09:50.746 --> 03:09:52.147
THERE'S A STATE CAN HAVE MORE

03:09:52.214 --> 03:09:53.682
TFA.

03:09:53.749 --> 03:09:54.883
IS IS THAT YOUR OF YOUR SCHOOL

03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:55.450
DISTRICT WILL ENTER INTO A

03:09:55.517 --> 03:09:56.952
CONTRACT FOR FIVE YEARS WITH

03:09:57.018 --> 03:09:57.886
THIRD PARTIES WHICH INCLUDES

03:09:57.953 --> 03:09:59.354
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE.

03:09:59.421 --> 03:10:02.424
TFA OUT THERE ARE THAT YOU THAT

03:10:02.491 --> 03:10:04.326
YOU WILL MAKE SURE YOU TRY TO IF

03:10:04.392 --> 03:10:05.193
THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH FOR A STATUS

03:10:05.260 --> 03:10:06.328
TO THEM AND THEY SHOULD BE GOOD

03:10:06.394 --> 03:10:07.362
ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER SET OF

03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:09.231
STUDENTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE. TO

03:10:09.297 --> 03:10:09.831
CLASS THE STUDENTS AND SO I

03:10:09.898 --> 03:10:11.399
THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT

03:10:11.466 --> 03:10:12.634
WE HAVE TAKEN THAT'S WHAT THE

03:10:12.701 --> 03:10:17.639
BILL SAYS CORRECTED TO BE CLEAR --

03:10:17.706 --> 03:10:19.307
THE AMENDMENTS DON'T BAN TFA.

03:10:19.374 --> 03:10:20.575
WITH A C. TO DO IS GET MORE

03:10:20.642 --> 03:10:21.476
EXPERIENCE TEACHERS IN THE

03:10:21.543 --> 03:10:23.812
CLASSROOM THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF

03:10:23.879 --> 03:10:25.080
THE BILL.

03:10:25.147 --> 03:10:26.782
OKAY MISTER I CAN JUST ASK ALSO

03:10:26.848 --> 03:10:27.883
THE WITNESS AS WELL BECAUSE YOU

03:10:27.949 --> 03:10:29.417
WOULD COMMENT ON THIS AYE IN

03:10:29.484 --> 03:10:30.051
RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION DO YOU

03:10:30.118 --> 03:10:31.686
THAT EXCEPT THAT -- IS THE

03:10:31.753 --> 03:10:32.354
RESULT OF THIS BILL WOULD BE THE

03:10:32.420 --> 03:10:34.923
PLACEMENT OF MORE LONG TERM SUBS

03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:35.490
AT LEAST IN THE FORESEEABLE

03:10:35.557 --> 03:10:36.258
FUTURE.

03:10:36.324 --> 03:10:37.225
I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW

03:10:37.292 --> 03:10:39.127
WHETHER LABOR MARKET A LOOK LIKE

03:10:39.194 --> 03:10:40.028
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS

03:10:40.095 --> 03:10:40.562
AND IT.

03:10:40.629 --> 03:10:42.164
YOU KNOW -- MAYBE DISTRICTS WILL

03:10:42.230 --> 03:10:43.498
PAY TEACHERS MORE MAYBE WORKING

03:10:43.565 --> 03:10:45.167
CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE THERE'S

03:10:45.233 --> 03:10:46.168
I THINK TOO MANY VARIABLES TO

03:10:46.234 --> 03:10:47.502
MAKE THAT A SUNSET ALL THINGS

03:10:47.569 --> 03:10:48.537
BEING EQUAL DO YOU THINK THE

03:10:48.603 --> 03:10:49.471
BILL WOULD RESULT IN THE

03:10:49.538 --> 03:10:52.607
PLACEMENT OF MORE LONG TERM SUB

03:10:52.674 --> 03:10:55.610
SOMETHINGS ARE NEVER EQUAL.

03:10:55.677 --> 03:10:56.211
SO YOU'RE NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS

03:10:56.278 --> 03:10:58.680
ALL RIGHT.

03:10:58.747 --> 03:10:59.080
SO.

03:10:59.147 --> 03:11:00.382
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT YOU

03:11:00.448 --> 03:11:02.384
COULD SEE HIM IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:11:02.450 --> 03:11:04.452
GARCIA -- AT THAT WOULD GET YOU

03:11:04.519 --> 03:11:06.288
KNOW BASED UPON THE PERFORMANCE

03:11:06.354 --> 03:11:08.456
OF OF TFA TEACHES VERSUS NON TFA

03:11:08.523 --> 03:11:11.726
TEACHERS -- THAT WOULD CONVINCE

03:11:11.793 --> 03:11:13.461
YOU THIS BILL IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

03:11:13.528 --> 03:11:14.663
AT THE MOMENT THERE HASN'T BEEN

03:11:14.729 --> 03:11:15.630
BUT YOU AND I CAN CONTINUE THE

03:11:15.697 --> 03:11:18.200
DISCUSSION ON IN THE FUTURE I

03:11:18.266 --> 03:11:19.167
MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT.

03:11:19.234 --> 03:11:21.469
THE PARAMETERS OF THE DEBATE ARE

03:11:21.536 --> 03:11:22.070
SO IF WE WERE TO HAVE EVIDENCE

03:11:22.137 --> 03:11:24.406
SHOWING THAT.

03:11:24.472 --> 03:11:28.810
THE TEACHERS WERE FIRED AT ARMS.

03:11:28.877 --> 03:11:29.845
MEMBERS OF THE DEBATE ARE ON THE

03:11:29.911 --> 03:11:30.412
BILL.

03:11:30.478 --> 03:11:31.546
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO GET

03:11:31.613 --> 03:11:32.280
IS SOME ESOTERIC CONVERSATION

03:11:32.347 --> 03:11:33.114
ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO

03:11:33.181 --> 03:11:34.082
IN THE FUTURE CAN YOU SPEAK TO

03:11:34.149 --> 03:11:34.983
THE TENANTS OF THE BILL.

03:11:35.050 --> 03:11:36.551
VOTE NO VOTE YES.

03:11:36.618 --> 03:11:37.652
BUT THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING IS

03:11:37.719 --> 03:11:39.020
CONTINUING ON FOREVER AND

03:11:39.087 --> 03:11:41.389
GETTING NO WHERE.

03:11:41.456 --> 03:11:42.691
WELL I I THINK IT'S PARTLY TO

03:11:42.757 --> 03:11:44.025
BLAME FOR THAT MISTER CHAIR SO I

03:11:44.092 --> 03:11:45.560
WILL WRAP UP MY QUESTIONING AT

03:11:45.627 --> 03:11:47.395
THIS POINT.

03:11:47.462 --> 03:11:50.799
I AND I WILL SAY JUST IN CLOSING

03:11:50.866 --> 03:11:52.801
THAT I ACTUALLY WANT TO THANK

03:11:52.868 --> 03:11:52.968
YOU.

03:11:53.034 --> 03:11:53.735
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD

03:11:53.802 --> 03:11:54.035
[inaudible]

03:11:54.102 --> 03:11:57.339
WE HAVE. SEVEN THOUSAND TFA

03:11:57.405 --> 03:11:59.708
ALARMS IN CALIFORNIA WHO KNOW

03:11:59.774 --> 03:12:01.509
BETTER THAN ANYONE THAT OUR

03:12:01.576 --> 03:12:03.211
PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS

03:12:03.278 --> 03:12:05.580
FAILING OUR KIDS AND THE DATA

03:12:05.647 --> 03:12:06.348
BEAR THAT OUT.

03:12:06.414 --> 03:12:07.649
THAT OUR KIDS IN LOW INCOME

03:12:07.716 --> 03:12:09.484
SCHOOLS -- GET A WORSE EDUCATION

03:12:09.551 --> 03:12:12.320
HERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE

03:12:12.387 --> 03:12:13.288
COUNTRY TF ELEMENT ALUMS KNOW

03:12:13.355 --> 03:12:15.223
THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE AND THIS

03:12:15.290 --> 03:12:16.157
BILL.

03:12:16.224 --> 03:12:17.859
MAKES VERY CLEAR THE MAIN REASON

03:12:17.926 --> 03:12:20.028
WHY IS THAT WE HAVE A COMMITTEE

03:12:20.095 --> 03:12:21.096
HERE.

03:12:21.162 --> 03:12:23.098
AT THE LEGISLATURE THAT IS NOT

03:12:23.164 --> 03:12:25.433
FOCUSED ON KIDS AND IT OPERATES

03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:27.369
AS A DEFAULT MODE OF PASTA

03:12:27.435 --> 03:12:29.571
POLICY MAKING IS ANTI STUDENT

03:12:29.638 --> 03:12:31.973
ANTI TEACHER AND ACT ANTI I

03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:32.807
FORTY AND THERE IS A MOVEMENT TO

03:12:32.874 --> 03:12:33.141
CHANGE THAT.

03:12:33.208 --> 03:12:34.609
TEACH FOR AMERICA IS A BIG PART

03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:36.878
OF THAT MOVEMENT AND I THINK

03:12:36.945 --> 03:12:38.513
THIS BILL MIGHT GET PAST THIS

03:12:38.580 --> 03:12:39.414
COMMITTEE DON'T A DANIELLE WILL

03:12:39.481 --> 03:12:44.085
NOT PASS.

03:12:44.152 --> 03:12:46.821
AND I THINK IT WILL GO OUT.

03:12:46.888 --> 03:12:47.155
IF YOU DON'T.

03:12:47.222 --> 03:12:48.590

ENSURE THAT YES ONE DAY EVERY

CHILD IN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE

03:12:57.866 --> 03:13:00.101

COMPUTER SCIENCE STANDARDS AND

03:21:42.423 --> 03:21:44.025
THE SOON TO BE ADOPTED CS.

03:21:44.091 --> 03:21:45.593
STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.

03:21:45.660 --> 03:21:47.161
OUR COMPUTER SCIENCE CHAMPIONS

03:21:47.228 --> 03:21:48.496
KNOW THAT HAVING A FOUNDATIONAL

03:21:48.563 --> 03:21:49.864
KNOWLEDGE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE

03:21:49.931 --> 03:21:51.165
OPENS DOORS.

03:21:51.232 --> 03:21:52.500
AB ONE EIGHTY TWO WILL CREATE A

03:21:52.567 --> 03:21:53.901
CLEAR PATHWAY FOR FUTURE

03:21:53.968 --> 03:21:55.269
COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS.

03:21:55.336 --> 03:21:56.404
THE EXISTING SUPPLEMENTARY

03:21:56.471 --> 03:21:57.738
AUTHORIZATION FOR COMPUTER

03:21:57.805 --> 03:21:59.440
SCIENCE ALLOWS TEACHERS TO TEACH

03:21:59.507 --> 03:22:01.442
CS BUT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE

03:22:01.509 --> 03:22:02.610
ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

03:22:02.677 --> 03:22:04.111
SUPPORT TEACHERS WHO MAY WANT TO

03:22:04.178 --> 03:22:06.080
TEACH CS AS THEIR PRIMARY

03:22:06.147 --> 03:22:06.814
SUBJECT.

03:22:06.881 --> 03:22:08.483
INSTEAD OF A FUTURE COMPUTER

03:22:08.549 --> 03:22:09.584
SCIENCE EDUCATOR MUST OBTAIN A

03:22:09.650 --> 03:22:11.018
SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL IN

03:22:11.085 --> 03:22:12.954
ANOTHER SUBJECT AND THEN SPENT

03:22:13.020 --> 03:22:14.689
EXTRA TIME AND MONEY.

03:22:14.755 --> 03:22:15.323
OUTSIDE OF THEIR CREDENTIALING

03:22:15.389 --> 03:22:17.325
PROGRAM TO TAKE ADDITIONAL

03:22:17.391 --> 03:22:18.860
COURSEWORK IN COMPUTER SCIENCE.

03:22:18.926 --> 03:22:19.894
IT IS IMPORTANT TO OFFER

03:22:19.961 --> 03:22:21.529
TEACHERS MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO

03:22:21.596 --> 03:22:23.297
TEACH CS IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR

03:22:23.364 --> 03:22:24.098
NEEDS.

03:22:24.165 --> 03:22:24.966
THIS BILL CREATES A SINGLE

03:22:25.032 --> 03:22:26.367
SUBJECT CREDENTIAL FOR COMPUTER

03:22:26.434 --> 03:22:27.668
SCIENCE THAT WOULD TARGET

03:22:27.735 --> 03:22:28.736
TEACHERS WHO WANT TO TEACH THE

03:22:28.803 --> 03:22:31.205
S. AS THEIR PRIMARY SUBJECT AREA.

03:22:31.272 --> 03:22:32.240
CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO

03:22:32.306 --> 03:22:33.841
CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS IN

03:22:33.908 --> 03:22:35.109
COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT EXIST AT

03:22:35.176 --> 03:22:36.878
CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION

03:22:36.944 --> 03:22:38.312
INSTITUTIONS.

03:22:38.379 --> 03:22:39.514
THE CREATION OF A SINGLE SUBJECT

03:22:39.580 --> 03:22:40.615
CREDENTIAL IT WOULD INCENTIVIZE

03:22:40.681 --> 03:22:42.116
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO

03:22:42.183 --> 03:22:43.084
CREATE.

03:22:43.150 --> 03:22:44.819
CS CREDENTIALING PRORAMS THANK

03:22:44.886 --> 03:22:45.286
YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND

03:22:45.353 --> 03:22:50.558
CONSIDERATION WE RESPECTFULLY

03:22:50.625 --> 03:22:52.560
ASK YOUR SUPPORT.

03:22:52.627 --> 03:22:53.160
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SUSAN

03:22:53.227 --> 03:22:53.961
BONY AND HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY

03:22:54.028 --> 03:22:54.562
REPRESENTING A NONPROFIT READY

03:22:54.629 --> 03:22:56.264
NATION OF BUSINESS LEADERS.

03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:58.232
WHO CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT A

03:22:58.299 --> 03:23:00.201
COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IN

03:23:00.268 --> 03:23:01.502
OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM?

03:23:01.569 --> 03:23:03.304
I'M JUST A FEW POINTS I WANTED

03:23:03.371 --> 03:23:05.239
TO TOUCH ON ONE IS THAT --

03:23:05.306 --> 03:23:06.607
TEACHERS GO INTO THE PROFESSION

03:23:06.674 --> 03:23:08.442
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PASSION THEY

03:23:08.509 --> 03:23:09.911
ARE NOT IN IT FOR THE MONEY.

03:23:09.977 --> 03:23:11.746
AND SO IF WE ARE ABLE TO

03:23:11.812 --> 03:23:13.648
ESTABLISH A CREDENTIAL I REALLY

03:23:13.714 --> 03:23:15.082
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE THOSE

03:23:15.149 --> 03:23:16.951
FUTURE TEACHERS THAT HAVE A

03:23:17.018 --> 03:23:19.287
PASSION FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE

03:23:19.353 --> 03:23:19.820
MAYBE NOT FOR THOSE OTHER

03:23:19.887 --> 03:23:20.922
SUBJECTS.

03:23:20.988 --> 03:23:21.822
AND THAT THEY WOULD REALLY

03:23:21.889 --> 03:23:24.058
APPRECIATE IT DEDICATED COURSE

03:23:24.125 --> 03:23:25.927
OF TEACHER PREPARATION IN

03:23:25.993 --> 03:23:28.095
COMPUTER SCIENCE -- I YOU KNOW

03:23:28.162 --> 03:23:29.897
YOU CAN I THINK SOME PEOPLE

03:23:29.964 --> 03:23:31.165
THINK YOU CAN JUST TEACH ANY

03:23:31.232 --> 03:23:32.333
SUBJECT THAT MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A

03:23:32.400 --> 03:23:33.868
LOT OF EDUCATION BUT ACTUALLY

03:23:33.935 --> 03:23:35.703
THE SKILL OF TEACHING.

03:23:35.770 --> 03:23:37.605
IS UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT AND SO

03:23:37.672 --> 03:23:39.106
CERTAINLY NOT ONLY CAN WE

03:23:39.173 --> 03:23:40.541
CAPTURE THOSE PEOPLE WITH THAT

03:23:40.608 --> 03:23:42.343
PASSION BUT THEN WE HOPE TO

03:23:42.410 --> 03:23:44.478
ENCOURAGE OUR UNIVERSITIES TO

03:23:44.545 --> 03:23:45.947
ACTUALLY DEVELOP DEDICATED.

03:23:46.013 --> 03:23:48.149
COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION

03:23:48.215 --> 03:23:50.117
PROGRAMS -- THIS MIGHT BE

03:23:50.184 --> 03:23:51.319
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE

03:23:51.385 --> 03:23:53.254
COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJOR AND MIGHT

03:23:53.321 --> 03:23:54.922
SOLVE THAT PROBLEM WHERE

03:23:54.989 --> 03:23:56.757
COMPUTER SCIENTIST MAYBE ARE

03:23:56.824 --> 03:23:57.725
TRACKED INTO A DIFFERENT

03:23:57.792 --> 03:23:59.360
PROFESSIONAL TOGETHER BUT

03:23:59.427 --> 03:24:01.028
COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION

03:24:01.095 --> 03:24:03.097
MAJORS WANT TO GO AND HELP

03:24:03.164 --> 03:24:04.899
OTHERS UNDERSTAND -- THE

03:24:04.966 --> 03:24:07.068
INTRICACIES OF COMPUTER SCIENCE

03:24:07.134 --> 03:24:09.370
AND THEN UP FINALLY -- WE ARE

03:24:09.437 --> 03:24:10.004
ALSO HOPING THERE WOULD BE AN

03:24:10.071 --> 03:24:12.139
EXAM THAT WOULD THEN HAPPENED

03:24:12.206 --> 03:24:13.140
WITH THE NEW CREDENTIAL

03:24:13.207 --> 03:24:14.742
CURRENTLY THERE IS NO SEE SAID

03:24:14.809 --> 03:24:17.144
EXAM EVERY OTHER -- ONE OF OUR

03:24:17.211 --> 03:24:18.412
SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIALS

03:24:18.479 --> 03:24:20.815
REQUIRES THIS THE EXAM THEY TAKE

03:24:20.881 --> 03:24:22.483
IS FOR INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY

03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:25.086
WHICH DOES NOT HAVE ONE QUESTION

03:24:25.152 --> 03:24:26.887
ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE ON IT BUT

03:24:26.954 --> 03:24:28.889
IT DOES HAVE A QUESTION ASKING

03:24:28.956 --> 03:24:30.291
YOU HOW TO CHANGE A TIRE.

03:24:30.358 --> 03:24:31.726
SO I THINK THAT THERE IS A

03:24:31.792 --> 03:24:34.362
BENEFIT -- TO THE TEACHING

03:24:34.428 --> 03:24:35.529
PROFESSION EXPANDING THE

03:24:35.596 --> 03:24:37.565
PROFESSION AND MAKING SURE THAT

03:24:37.632 --> 03:24:39.767
THESE HIGH QUALITY -- TEACHING

03:24:39.834 --> 03:24:41.002
THAT HAPPENS AND I REALLY

03:24:41.068 --> 03:24:42.503
COMMEND THOSE TEACHERS OF THE

03:24:42.570 --> 03:24:44.472
FIRST ADOPTERS WHO ARE GOING OUT

03:24:44.538 --> 03:24:45.473
AND GETTING THAT SUPPLEMENTARY

03:24:45.539 --> 03:24:49.143
AUTHORIZATION.

03:24:49.210 --> 03:24:50.945
MY CONCERN IS AROUND EQUITY WHAT

03:24:51.012 --> 03:24:51.579
ABOUT THE DISTRICTS WHERE THERE

03:24:51.646 --> 03:24:52.780
ISN'T ONE OF THOSE REALLY GO

03:24:52.847 --> 03:24:54.548
GETTER TEACHERS THAT'S WILLING

03:24:54.615 --> 03:24:56.384
TO PUT IN THAT EXTRA TIME. FOR

03:24:56.450 --> 03:24:58.019
THE EXTRA TRAINING I THINK THIS

03:24:58.085 --> 03:24:59.820
IS A STATE WIDE INTEREST TO MAKE

03:24:59.887 --> 03:25:02.390
SURE THAT ALL ACROSS THE THE

03:25:02.456 --> 03:25:04.025
STATE IN YEARS TO COME THERE

03:25:04.091 --> 03:25:05.326
WOULD ACTUALLY BE A CREDENTIAL

03:25:05.393 --> 03:25:07.261
COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHER

03:25:07.328 --> 03:25:08.529

FROM OUT OF MY NOTES WHICH IS --

03:57:39.478 --> 03:57:42.548
I HAVE BEEN A CLASSROOM TEACHER.

03:57:42.615 --> 03:57:44.016
FOR CLOSE TO THIRTY YEARS AND

03:57:44.083 --> 03:57:46.285
HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING FROM WHAT

03:57:46.352 --> 03:57:49.588
WE USED TO CALL OF THE DUPLO

03:57:49.655 --> 03:57:51.657

03:57:51.724 --> 03:57:53.192
THAT YOU WOULD ROLL OUT DIDN'T

WRITE EVERYTHING BY HAND.

03:57:54.893 --> 03:57:57.262

03:58:00.065 --> 03:58:01.700
OF MY KIDS MY OWN CHILDREN TELL

03:58:01.767 --> 03:58:04.803
ME -- OUTDATED TO TECHNOLOGY BUT

03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:06.538
AT OVER THE THREE DECADES OF

03:58:06.605 --> 03:58:08.574
EDUCATION WE CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN

03:58:08.641 --> 03:58:11.143
NOT ONLY HOW ARE YOUNG LEARNERS

03:58:11.210 --> 03:58:13.512
ARE LEARNING DIFFERENTLY BUT

03:58:13.579 --> 03:58:15.447
HELL TEACHERS HAVE -- HAD TO

03:58:15.514 --> 03:58:17.916
EVOLVE OVER THOSE YEARS AND SO

03:58:17.983 --> 03:58:20.019
AS WE START TO LOOK AT

03:58:20.085 --> 03:58:22.054
TECHNOLOGY IS JUST.

03:58:22.121 --> 03:58:24.523
PART OF WHAT WE DO ALL OF US

03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:26.291
EVERY DAY LOOKING ARE AT OUR OWN

03:58:26.358 --> 03:58:27.726
DEVICES UP.

03:58:27.793 --> 03:58:29.395
TO I BELIEVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND

03:58:29.461 --> 03:58:31.196
TIMES A DAY IS WHAT I'VE HEARD

03:58:31.263 --> 03:58:33.599
WITH OUR INDIVIDUAL DEVICES IF

03:58:33.666 --> 03:58:35.167
YOU TRACKED THAT IT'S KIND OF

03:58:35.234 --> 03:58:37.703
SCARY BUT WE ARE USING

03:58:37.770 --> 03:58:39.772
TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT OUR DAY

03:58:39.838 --> 03:58:41.807
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE.

03:58:41.874 --> 03:58:47.780
THAT OUR COMPUTER SCIENCE --

03:58:47.846 --> 03:58:49.248
KILL -- IS AS UP TO DATE IN AS

03:58:49.314 --> 03:58:50.049
THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE SO THIS

03:58:50.115 --> 03:58:51.150
WOULD PREPARE AND ENCOURAGE

03:58:51.216 --> 03:58:53.952
STUDENTS AT AN EARLIER AGE TO

03:58:54.019 --> 03:58:58.023
PURSUE -- NOT ONLY A COMPUTER

03:58:58.090 --> 03:58:58.891
TECHNOLOGY BUT IT.

03:58:58.957 --> 03:59:00.225
ADDITIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

03:59:00.292 --> 03:59:02.594
TYPICALLY TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS --

03:59:02.661 --> 03:59:05.230
MAKING SURE THAT WE GO BEYOND

03:59:05.297 --> 03:59:07.066
DIGITAL LITERACY COMPUTER

03:59:07.132 --> 03:59:09.368
SCIENCE EDUCATION WOULD PREPARE

03:59:09.435 --> 03:59:10.969
THE NEXT GENERATION OF

03:59:11.036 --> 03:59:14.273
CALIFORNIANS TO SUCCEED AND YET.

03:59:14.339 --> 03:59:16.041
ALSO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE

03:59:16.108 --> 03:59:21.313
COURSES AVAILABLE FOR THIS AB

03:59:21.380 --> 03:59:22.548
FOURTEEN TEN WOULD GOVERN GROW

03:59:22.614 --> 03:59:24.783
AWARDING GRANTS TO SUPPORT

03:59:24.850 --> 03:59:26.518
TEACHERS IN ENTERTAINING A

03:59:26.585 --> 03:59:28.954
COMPUTER SCIENCE AUTHORIZATION

03:59:29.021 --> 03:59:31.056
IN THIS IS REALLY A KEY PART.

03:59:31.123 --> 03:59:32.491
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MANY

03:59:32.558 --> 03:59:34.460
TEACHERS HAVE EVOLVED IN

03:59:34.526 --> 03:59:36.462
LEARNING TO USE TECHNOLOGY OR

03:59:36.528 --> 03:59:37.996
HAVE GROWING UP WITH THAT BUT WE

03:59:38.063 --> 03:59:39.498
HAVE NOT OFFERED A COMPUTER

03:59:39.565 --> 03:59:43.268
SCIENCE AUTHORIZATION AND I KNOW

03:59:43.335 --> 03:59:45.738
IN THE HIRING OF TEACHERS.

03:59:45.804 --> 03:59:47.239
AND MORE AND MORE THESE ARE THE

03:59:47.306 --> 03:59:48.774
TYPE OF SKILLS WE WANT TO MAKE

03:59:48.841 --> 03:59:51.176
SURE THAT OUR TEACHERS HAVE BUT

03:59:51.243 --> 03:59:53.612
IF THEY GO THE EXTRA STEP MIKE

03:59:53.679 --> 03:59:55.080
WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT WOULD BE

03:59:55.147 --> 03:59:56.782
A VERY VALUABLE ASSET TO A

03:59:56.849 --> 03:59:59.284

03:59:59.351 --> 04:00:02.788
