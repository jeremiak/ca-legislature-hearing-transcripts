00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:23.133
APPROACH THAT'S NECESSARY IN

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.301
ORDER.

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.337
TO MITIGATE THE RISKS TO THE

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:27.838
PEOPLE AND PROPERTY.

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:29.306
OF THE STATE.

00:43:29.373 --> 00:43:32.109
I WELL WE ALSO ALLOW FOR SOME OF

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:34.979
THE LANDSCAPE TO BURN AND

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:37.314
REPLENISH ITS NATURAL STATE AS

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:38.515
WELL.

00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:41.318
SO OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS --

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:42.786
WE'VE HAD THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:45.022
SEASONS AND I'M JUST GONNA JUST

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.557
GONNA PUT IT IN IN -- STRUCTURE

00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:49.693
TERMS. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.863
HAD OVER TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES --

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.866
THAT BURNED DUE TO WILDFIRES.

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:56.900
THAT WAS THE WORST IN CALIFORNIA

00:43:56.967 --> 00:44:00.671
HISTORY. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:02.106
COMES AROUND.

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:04.641
AND WE DOUBLE THAT MORE THAN

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:06.543
DOUBLE THAT MORE THAN TWENTY

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.813
THOUSAND STRUCTURES BURNED IN.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.414
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:12.883
MOST -- OF DESTRUCTIVE AND

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.585
DEADLY.

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:16.587
WILDFIRES OCCURRED.

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:19.623
OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE -- PASSED

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:22.559
AWAY DUE TO WILDFIRE IN TWO

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:23.327
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SIX OF THOSE

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:25.295
BEING FIRST RESPONDERS.

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:28.432
A TRAGIC YEAR -- FOR SURE.

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.868
SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:32.803
COMBINED EFFECT OF CLIMATE

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:35.839
CHANGE -- FIRE SUPPRESSION

00:44:35.906 --> 00:44:38.108
ACTIVITIES LAND USE PLANNING

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:41.345
ACTIVITIES OVERGROWN -- FOREST

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:43.047
AREAS.

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:44.715
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN MANAGED OR

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:47.084
ALLOWED FOR NATURAL MANAGEMENT

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:49.353
THROUGH FIRE ACTIVITY -- AND

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.088
THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO THESE

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:56.160
LARGER AND MORE DAMAGING FIRES.

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:57.227
THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE

00:44:57.294 --> 00:44:59.096
SEEING IS.

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:02.533
A LOT OF GROWTH OF OF HUMAN

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:05.736
ACTIVITY AND DEVELOPMENT INTO

00:45:05.803 --> 00:45:07.404
THESE AREAS.

00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:09.339
AND THAT'S HAPPENED OVER DECADES

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:10.874
IT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT'S A NEW

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:11.809
PROBLEM.

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:12.876
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

00:45:12.943 --> 00:45:15.746
BECOMING VERY CLEAR TO US IS

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:17.481
THAT THERE IS -- A VULNERABILITY

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:19.850
ISSUE THAT WE DID NOT PREVIOUSLY

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:22.786
REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT -- THE

00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:25.389
OLD VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES --

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:28.725
INCLUDING -- YOU PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:45:28.792 --> 00:45:30.094
HAVE MOBILITY ISSUES

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:35.332
COMMUNICATIONS ISSUES -- OR EVEN

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:37.868
A LACK OF OF TRANSPORTATION FEW

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:40.904
CARS PER HOUSEHOLD -- MAYBE

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:42.506
YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:45.742
SCHOOL AGE AT HOME AND ARE NOT.

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.511
OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITY DURING

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:50.781
THE DAYTIME -- ALL OF THOSE

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:54.518
ISSUES ARE ARE -- VERY KEY -- TO

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:56.153
MITIGATING THIS PROBLEM IN THE

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.422
FUTURE AND IT'S NOT JUST A RURAL

00:45:58.489 --> 00:45:59.656
PROBLEM.

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:02.025
THERE CITIES THROUGHOUT --

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:03.727
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE VERY MUCH IN

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:07.631
PERIL -- CLOSE TO US -- SANTA

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:09.399
ROSA AS WE KNOW.

00:46:09.466 --> 00:46:11.969
GLARING EXAMPLE OAKLAND AS WELL

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:14.671
AND MANY OTHERS [inaudible]

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:17.474
SO.

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:20.344
I WANT AYE IT'S NOT NOT ALL

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:24.448
DESPAIR -- CAL FIRE AND THE

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:27.251
OFFICES OF OF A STATE GOVERNMENT

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:29.419
THAT HAVE RESPONSE --

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:31.722
RESPONSIBILITY -- INCLUDING --

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:34.124
CALLOW YES -- ARE IN THE

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:35.392
COMMUNITY AND WORKING WITH

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:37.594
COMMUNITIES TO PLAN FOR THESE

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:42.533
ACTIVITIES THAT NEED TO BE DONE --

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:44.468
AND PREPARING FOR A RISK

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:47.604
REDUCTION -- WELL IT'S NOT JUST

00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:50.541
FIRE RESPONSE -- IT INCLUDES --

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:51.742
HAZARD ASSESSMENT RISK

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:54.344
ASSESSMENT -- AND THEN FIRE

00:46:54.411 --> 00:46:56.413
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES DOING

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.814
THOSE THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT

00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:59.216
PREVIOUSLY FUELS MANAGEMENT.

00:46:59.283 --> 00:47:01.485
PRESCRIBED BURNING -- AND THOSE

00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:02.920
KIND OF THINGS.

00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.922
AND I THINK -- WHAT WE'D LIKE TO

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:07.624
DO I MEAN I I'M GONNA PASS THIS --

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:09.426
TO MY PARTNER.

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.495

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:17.734
THOSE THOSE -- PLANNING AND KIND

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:19.937
OF LONG RANGE -- PLANNED

00:47:20.003 --> 00:47:21.772
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES THAT WE'RE

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:25.108
WORKING THROUGH. TWENTY THANK

AND AREAS.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.068
DEVELOPING IN REVIEWING

00:47:51.134 --> 00:47:52.836
REGULATIONS AND BUILDING

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:55.005

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:58.242
PROTECTION METHODS AND

00:47:58.308 --> 00:47:59.409
RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:01.545
SINCE OUR FOCUS TODAY IS ON

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:02.613
HOUSING AND THE THREAT TO

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:04.982
HOUSING POSED BY WILDFIRE.

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.116
I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE OUR

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:07.985
PROGRAMS.

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.119
THAT MOST DIRECTLY IMPACT THE

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:10.887
SAFE DEVELOPMENT IN OCCUPANCY OF

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:13.457
HOMES IN WELFARE PRONE AREAS.

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:15.225
AND WHILE I'M GOING TO TALK

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:15.659
ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS

00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:16.827
INDIVIDUALLY.

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:18.328
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:19.496
ADOPTING A WILDFIRE IN

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:21.999
CALIFORNIA REQUIRES A SYSTEMATIC

00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:23.400
APPROACH.

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:25.569
IT REQUIRES PLANNING COMMUNITIES

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:26.670
THAT ARE HARDENED AGAINST

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:29.206
WILDFIRES WITH FEW BREAKS IN AND

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:31.608
AROUND THE COMMUNITIES.

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.677
ENSURING COMMUNITIES HAVE PROPER

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:36.613
EVACUATION ROUTES WATER SUPPLIES

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.416
IN FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES.

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:40.484
IN BUILDING HOMES AT A TIMBER

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.286
REDEEMER RESISTANT MATERIALS

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:43.820
WHILE MAINTAINING A ONE HUNDRED

FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:46.923
BY REMOVING DEAD AN OVERGROWN

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.393
VEGETATION WHICH ALSO AND ALSO

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:50.961
EDUCATING THE PUBLIC TO PREVENT

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:53.530
THE START AND SPREAD OF HUMAN

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:55.832
BECAUSE WILDFIRES.

00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:58.368
WELL BEFORE HOUSES ARE BUILT IN

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:00.103
COMMUNITIES ARE DEVELOPED THOUGH.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.140
WE IDENTIFY AND MAP FIRE HAZARD

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:04.775
AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.843
THESE AREAS ARE ZONES ARE MAPPED

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.712
USING A SCIENCE BASED COMPUTER

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:09.479
MODEL.

00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:10.914
THAT ASSIGNS A HAZARD SCORE

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:13.050
BASED ON MANY FACTORS THAT

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:15.052
INFLUENCE FIRE LIKELIHOOD AND

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.087
FIRE BEHAVIOR.

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:18.355
THE FACTORS CONSIDERED INCLUDE

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:20.624
FIRE HISTORY.

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:22.326
EXISTING AND POTENTIAL FUEL

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:23.927
NATURAL VEGETATION.

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:26.430
TOPOGRAPHY FLAME LINK BLOWING

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:28.965
MEMBERS AND TYPICAL WEATHER FOR

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:30.067
THE AREA.

00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:31.401
OUR FIRE RESOURCE ASSESSMENT

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:32.936
PROGRAM.

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.838
USES THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:36.573
AND DATED TO OF AVAILABLE TO

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.942
DEVELOP AND FIELD TESTING MODEL.

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:40.844
THAT IS USED TO IDENTIFY THREE

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:43.413
INCREASING FIRE HAZARDS.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.116
MEDIUM HIGH IN VERY HIGH.

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.718
WE HAVE BEGUN THE PROCESS FOR

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:48.919
UPDATING THE FIRE HAZARD TO

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:51.021
THEIR DESIGNS USING THE LATEST

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:52.956
TECHNOLOGIES AND MAPPING.

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:54.524
NEW MAPPING WILL INCLUDE NEW

00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:56.026
FACTORS INCLUDING.

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:58.729
THE RECENTLY AND USE CHANGES NEW

00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:00.864
SIGNIFICANT WIND EVENT DATA AS

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.432
WELL AS THE MODEL THAT IS MORE

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:04.368
SPATIALLY DETAILED. TWO HUNDRED

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:07.437
ACRES DOWN TO TWO ACRE PARCELS.

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.473
MAPS ARE IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IN

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:11.942
LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS.

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:13.810
WHERE THE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:15.178
SEVERITY ZONE TRIGGERS WELL IN

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:16.513
BUILDING CODES FOR NEW

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.881
CONSTRUCTION?

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:19.449
OF COURSE THESE CODES APPLY TO

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:21.618
ALL THREE ZONES IN THE STATE

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.987
RESPONSIBILITY AREA.

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:25.822
IT'S BEEN ASKED AT THESE MAPS

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:26.523
SHOULD BE UPDATED MORE

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:28.525
FREQUENTLY AND THE REALITY IS

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:30.894
MOST OF THE FACTORS ARE CONSTANT.

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:31.661
OVER THE YEARS AND ARE STILL

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:33.964
RELEVANT.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.866
HOWEVER WE UPDATE THE MODEL IS

00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:37.567
NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:38.969
BECOMES AVAILABLE.

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.370
AND FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE JUST NOW

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:43.240
COMPLETING NEW DATA AVAILABLE ON

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:44.708
SIGNIFICANT WHEN DEFENSE.

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:47.010
THESE ISOLATED AND EXTREME WIND

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:48.879
EVENTS HAVE BEEN THE ROOT OF

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:49.946
SEVERITY.

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:52.883
OF THE NORTH BAY FIRES IN TWO

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:53.517

THE NEXT THING.

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:16.646
MOVING OUTSIDE OF THE THE HUMAN

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:17.847
AND TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.282
STRUCTURE.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:22.452
IS DEFENSIBLE SPACE WE NEED.

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.654
EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR DEFENSIBLE

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:26.489
SPACE EVERYBODY.

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:29.792
IS LIKE HARDENING HOMES IF 90%

DO AND 10% DON'T.

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:34.964
THAT 10% IS GOING -- TO HAVE AN

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:37.133
ADVERSE EFFECT ON SOME OF THE

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.502
OTHER 90% PROBABLY NOT ALL OF IT

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.137
FOR MAYBE.

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:43.039

AND WE'RE TRYING TO TOUCH EVERY --

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.346
EVERY HOPE HOUSEHOLD ONCE EVERY

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.048
THREE YEARS WE ARE NOT MEETING

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:55.585
THAT BUT THAT IS THE THE GOAL --

01:00:55.651 --> 01:01:01.824
WE FIND THAT -- 82% OF OF OUR

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:04.160
FIRST INSPECTIONS ARE COMPLIANT

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.962
INSPECTIONS.

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.996
AND BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:10.233
THIRD INSPECTION -- 92% OF ALL

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:12.068
STRUCTURES ARE MEETING THAT --

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:14.237
THAT COMPLIANCE.

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:17.040
IT DOESN'T MEAN EVERY.

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:20.510
PROPERTY IS COMPLIANT.

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:21.611
SO.

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:24.180
FROM THERE WE NEED TO MOVE INTO

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:25.448
THE KIND OF THE THE WE WE THE

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.817
THAT ZONE THAT IS BETWEEN THE

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:30.319
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND WHAT I'LL

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:32.321
CALL THE WOODS OR THE BACK

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:33.489
COUNTRY.

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:35.224
OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.060
THAN THEN WHERE WE HAVE DANCE

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.161
HOUSING.

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:39.829
DEVELOPMENTS MAYBE THERE'S A

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:42.965
HOUSE EVERY FIVE TO TEN ACRES

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.267
BUT THAT'S KIND OF OUT THERE

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:46.769
THIS WILL EASE OWN IN BETWEEN --

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:49.272
THE THE CONSTRUCTED AREA OR THE

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:51.407
OR THE BUILT OUT AREA AND AND

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:55.545
THOSE MORE WERE OF RURAL AREAS --

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:57.647
WE NEED TO DO OF LANDSCAPE LEVEL

01:01:57.713 --> 01:02:00.516
FUEL STREETS [inaudible]

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:04.087
AND THE GOVERNOR KNEW SOME --

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:06.456
ORDERED -- THE CALIFORNIA YOU

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:08.324
LOOK AT WHERE WE WOULD DO THOSE

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.193
IN THE SHORT TERM THIS YEAR THIS

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:12.695
SEASON -- IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:15.164
RISK TO THE VULNERABLE --

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:17.233
ELEMENTS OF COMMUNITIES WHICH I

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.601
WAS MENTIONING PREVIOUSLY.

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:20.703
AND WE DID WE PUT THOSE SCREENS

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.905
OVER -- OUR PLANNING PROCESS WE

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:24.107
CAME UP WITH THIRTY FIVE

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.908
PROJECTS THAT WE COULD GET DONE

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:28.678
THIS YEAR -- THAT NEEDED TO GET

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:31.147
DONE THIS YEAR TO PROTECT --

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.616
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES OF TWO

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:36.719
HUNDRED PLUS -- COMMUNITIES

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:39.155
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:40.890
THE IMPORTANT THING THAT IS

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:43.292
DIFFERENT IS THIS SOCIO ECONOMIC

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.261
AND MOBILITY SCREEN THAT WE PUT

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:46.295
OVER IT.

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.331
SO IT'S NOT EVERY COMMUNITY

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:50.566
THAT'S IMPERIL TO WATCH WILDFIRE.

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:52.668
BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY THE COOLEY

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:54.003
THOSE THAT HAVE VULNERABLE.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.606
ELEMENTS WHERE WE COULD HAVE

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:59.242
CATASTROPHIC SITUATIONS OCCUR A

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.943
FIRE RUNS THROUGH THOSE AREAS

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.210
MEETING.

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.446
LOSS OF LIFE [inaudible]

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:04.981
SO.

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:06.916
WE'VE UNDERTAKEN THOSE PROJECTS

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.251
THE OTHER SCREENING ELEMENT OF

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:10.386
THOSE PROJECTS WERE THEY THEY

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.989
DID NOT HAVE SEEK WHAT ON SO.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.590
THE REQUIREMENT WAS THAT THEY

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:17.059
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY --

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:18.461
DECLARED IN ORDER -- TO

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.562
UNDERTAKE THEM.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.565
WE DID THAT -- THOSE THIRTY FIVE

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.800
PROJECTS WHILE THEY DO NOT HAVE

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:27.336
A FORMAL SEEK WHAT PROCESS.

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:29.705
ALL OF THAT PLANNING AND ALL OF

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:31.841
THAT REVIEW PROCESS IS TAKING

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.910
PLACE -- UNFORTUNATELY WE WE

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.245
DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO DO THE

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.813
THE PUBLIC SCREENING OF THAT BUT

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.617
WE DID DO THE THE WORK ON THAT

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:42.885
TWENTY EIGHT OF THOSE THIRTY

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.720
FIVE PROJECTS ARE ARE -- BEING

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:47.356

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.665
PLANNING SO THE IDEA IS THAT

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:50.666
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GENERAL

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.101
PLAN AND THE HAZARD MITIGATION

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.869
PLAN THEY COME TOGETHER.

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.304
THEY LINK TOGETHER AS

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:58.107
DEVELOPMENT STARTS -- TO BE

01:12:58.173 --> 01:13:00.542
CONSIDERED -- THEY'RE THINKING

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:01.777
ABOUT WHAT ARE THE RISKS

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.245
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT DEVELOPMENT

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:05.080
IT SHOULD GO FORWARD AND THEY'RE

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.782
PUTTING A MITIGATION EFFORTS TO

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:08.083
MAKE SURE THAT THAT.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.052
DEVELOPMENT OUR COMMUNITY IS AS

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:12.554
RESILIENT AS POSSIBLE MOVING

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.323
FORWARD.

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:16.024
IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT DISASTER

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:18.193
SO THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORTS AND

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:20.462
ACTIONS DEPENDING ON WE'RE A

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:21.430
COMMUNITY IS SITTING OR

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.165

ARE IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THE THE

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:10.873
PLAN CALIFORNIA OUR STATE HAS

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:13.041
MITIGATION PLAN WAS JUST UPDATED

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:15.510
APPROVED IN -- TWO THOUSAND

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:17.613
EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW IT -- IF IT IS

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.381

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:20.916
CLIMATE IMPACTS INTO THE

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.552
PLANNING ACTIVITIES -- IN FACT --

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:24.720
IT HAS THE MOST EXTENSIVE

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:26.355
CLIMATE SCIENCE AND STRATEGIES

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.689
THAN ANY OTHER PLAN IN THE

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.091
NATION AT THIS POINT.

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:31.260
WITH REGARDS OF A CURRENT --

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:32.427
SCIENCE UNDERSTANDING AND WHAT

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:34.396
WE'VE WE'VE PUT INTO THE A

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:35.397
PROGRAM.

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.332
AND BECAUSE OF THE HISTORIES OF

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:39.668
DISASTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA --

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.270
YOU KNOW ENCOURAGING COMMUNITIES

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:42.638
TO ADOPT THEIR LOCAL HAZARD

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.006
MITIGATION PLAN.

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:47.009
EARLY IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR US --

01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:50.379
IN FACT YOU BE SURPRISED THAT --

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:52.281
OR MAYBE NOT THAT -- WHEN THESE

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:53.749
DISASTERS YET WE STILL HAVE

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.350
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:57.352
NECESSARILY HAVE THE UP TO DATE

01:15:57.419 --> 01:15:58.587
HAS A MEDICATION PLAN OR HOW

01:15:58.654 --> 01:15:59.621
FAST MITIGATION PLAN?

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:00.789
AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IT'S

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:02.024
A PRIORITY FOR AS IS BEEN A

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.091
PRIORITY FOR US TO GET

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:06.495
COMMUNITIES -- FOCUSED ON THEIR

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:08.664
HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN -- AND

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.499
THEN MAKE SURE THIS TIED TO THAT

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:13.101
GENERAL PLAN -- IN FACT THE

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:14.636
FEDERAL DISASTER MITIGATION ACT

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.571
OF TWO THOUSAND DOES REQUIRE

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:17.673
THAT STAGE REVIEW LOCAL HAZARD

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.241
MITIGATION PLANS AS PART OF

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:20.309
THEIR STATE.

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.677
HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:24.146
PROCESS WHICH WE DO WHEN WE WENT

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:26.415
AWAY AT YES -- THE INTENT OF

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:28.183
THAT IS THREE FULL FIRST IS TO

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.818
GATHER HAZARD VULNERABILITY AND

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:31.887
MITIGATION INFORMATION FROM OUR

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:34.556
LOCAL -- LEVEL AND AND USE IT

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:35.791
FOR STATE LEVEL PLANNING.

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:37.392
SECOND IS TO ENSURE THE STATE

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:38.760
LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:40.862
IS COORDINATED TO THE GREATEST

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:41.430
EXTENT.

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:43.632
PRACTICAL AND THIRD IS TO ENSURE

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:44.733
THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.368
MADE AWARE.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.336
OF THE HAZARD -- HASN'T

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:48.670
VULNERABILITIES WITHIN THEIR

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:50.339
JURISDICTION AND TO DEVELOP

01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:55.811
STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THOSE

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.846
VULNERABILITIES -- SO.

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:58.880
WE GET FUNDING THROUGH FEMA

01:16:58.947 --> 01:16:59.514
TYPICALLY SO THERE'S A COUPLE

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:00.749
WAYS WE GET FUNDING TO SUPPORT

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:02.551
HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAMS AT

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:06.021

ROUGHLY BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND 20%

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.161
OF THE TOTAL COST OF THAT

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:15.197
DISASTER IS COMES BACK TO THE

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:16.298
STATE.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.200

COMMAND IT'S UP TO US TO MAKE A

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:36.485
DETERMINATION OF HOW HOW WE WANT

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:51.579
THAT UPDATE.

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:52.647
NEEDS TO BE BASED ON STATE

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:54.282
RESOURCES THAT WE AND OTHERS

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:55.984
MANAGE INCLUDING KHALLID OUT AND

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:56.918
CALIFORNIA ADAPTATION PLANNING

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:00.655
GUIDE -- AT OPR WE ALSO PRODUCE

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:01.890
THE FIRE HAZARD TECHNICAL

01:26:01.956 --> 01:26:04.225
ADVISORY TO HELP COMMUNITIES --

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:05.226
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THINK

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:06.694
YOU'RE WILD FIRE MITIGATION AND

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.062
PREPAREDNESS SO.

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:09.230
ALL OF THOSE PIECES IN

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:10.298
COMBINATION WITH EVERYTHING YOU

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:12.166
HEARD HERE ARE REALLY THE SHORT

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:14.035
TERM WHAT COMMUNITIES DO WITH

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:15.370
THEIR EXISTING STRUCTURES WITH

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.704
THEIR EXISTING PLANS.

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:17.939
UP TO BETTER PROTECT THEMSELVES

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.307
AND TO REDUCE RISK BUT THERE'S

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:21.476
ALSO A LONGER TERM PART OF THIS

01:26:21.543 --> 01:26:23.278
CONVERSATION WHICH IS THE HOW DO

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:26.381
WE START TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE.

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:27.649
WHEN WE KNOW AND MY COLLEAGUE

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:28.850
AND TERRIBLE TALK MUCH MORE

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.318
ABOUT THIS BUT WE KNOW THAT

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:32.153
CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXACERBATING

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.454
ALL THESE IMPACTS?

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:34.956
OF THAT WET SEASONS COMBINED AND

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:37.358
DRY SEASONS AS YOU KNOW CREATE

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:38.826
MORE VEGETATION WHICH THEN DRIES

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:41.763
OUT WHICH CREATES A SITUATION.

01:26:41.829 --> 01:26:43.531
THAT'S RIGHT FOR MORE FREQUENT

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:46.134
AND SEVERE WILDFIRES THAT IS

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.769
HAPPENING IN COMBINATION WITH.

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:49.103
AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN THE

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.271
STATE THAT'S MOVING PEOPLE

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:52.073
FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT OF SOME

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.675
OF THE MORE URBAN JOB CENTERS OF

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:55.443
THE STATE.

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:57.078
I I WAS THAT I IDEA EVENT WITH A

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.012
NUMBER OF FOLKS FROM PARADISE

01:26:58.079 --> 01:27:00.281
RECENTLY WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:01.749
EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH TWO

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:03.518
BEDROOM HOUSES IN PARADISE.

01:27:03.585 --> 01:27:05.587
THAT'S NOT A NUMBER YOU HERE IN

01:27:05.653 --> 01:27:06.387
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PEOPLE

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:08.356
ARE MOVING FURTHER OUT IN PART

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:10.058
TO FIND AFFORDABILITY A LOT OF

01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:12.093
THOSE FOLKS ARE SENIORS ON MIXED

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.494
AND ON FIXED INCOMES.

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.463
WE KNOW FROM ALL THE DATA AS YOU

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:16.998
ALL KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.933
THE FATALITIES IN THESE FIRES WE

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.135
HAVE BEEN PEOPLE OVER.

01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:21.903
SIXTY FIVE ON ZERO SORT OF

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.671
GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED SOCIALLY

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.373
ISOLATED FOLKS HAVING LESS

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.674
MOBILITY HARDER TO GET OUT OF

01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:28.843
THEIR HOMES AND A LOT OF THAT IS

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:29.944
EXACT NOT ALL BUT SOME OF IT IS

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:34.749
EXACERBATED BY THE AFFORDABILITY

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.217
CRISIS.

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:37.051
SO ALTERNATELY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:37.585
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:38.453
THINKING ABOUT THESE RISKS WHEN

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:39.387
DOING LONG TERM PLANNING.

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:41.356
WE NOW ON THE HOUSING SIDE WHICH

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:42.423
WERE ALSO VERY INVOLVED IN THAT

01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:43.958
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE REQUIRED

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:45.093
TO PLAN FOR THEIR HOUSING NEEDS

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.427
WERE HAVING A VERY ACTIVE STATE

01:27:46.494 --> 01:27:47.562
CONVERSATION AND OF COURSE THE

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:48.930
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS.

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:49.931
HAVING AN ACTIVE CONVERSATION

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:51.699
ABOUT WHAT THOSE PROJECTIONS

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:52.300
LOOK LIKE AND WHAT ARE HOUSING

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:53.267
NEEDS ARE.

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:54.836
UNFORTUNATELY SHORTFALLS IN OUR

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:55.937
HOUSING HIS COULD HAVE

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:58.139
CONTRIBUTED TO THIS THIS URGENCY

01:27:58.206 --> 01:27:59.641
IN THIS EMERGENCY AFFORDABILITY

01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:00.975
SITUATION THERE IS AN EXTREME

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.477
SHORTAGE OF HOUSING IN THE STATE

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:03.845
AS YOU KNOW EVERYONE OF YOUR

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:05.279
DISTRICTS HAS THIS PROBLEM.

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:07.548
YOU POINTED OUT -- REQUIRING

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:08.449
CALIFORNIANS TO SPEND AN

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:10.084
INCREASING AMOUNT OF MONEY ON

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:12.253
HOUSING BUT ALSO AN INCREASING

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.755
AMOUNT ON TRANSPORTATION.

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:15.490
SO IT'S SORT OF EXACERBATING ALL

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:17.358
THESE ISSUES AND THEN ULTIMATELY

01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:19.360
PUSHING FOLKS -- IN SOME CASES

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:23.498
INTO THESE WE WE AREAS THESE

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:24.499
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREAS.

01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:26.034
WE CANNOT USE THE HOUSING CRISIS

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.136
AS A REASON TO EXPAND HOUSING

01:28:28.202 --> 01:28:29.337
DEVELOPMENT OVER THE LONG TERM

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:30.705
INTO AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:31.673
THAT ARE.

01:28:31.739 --> 01:28:33.307
EXTREMELY HIGH RISK.

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:34.575
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:35.743
KNOW JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.645
ACROSS ALL THESE AREAS WHETHER

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:40.014
IT'S RISK AND LIABILITY TO THE

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:41.582
STATE AND INDIVIDUALS.

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:43.818
BOB ALSO WHETHER IT'S RISK TO

01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:45.153
UNDERMINING THE VERY CLIMATE

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:46.721
GOALS THAT CALIFORNIA LEADS ON

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:48.089
THAT ARE WE HOPE.

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.291
GOING TO EVENTUALLY MINIMIZE OUR

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:51.759
FIRE RISK IF WE CAN BRING

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:52.927
EMISSIONS DOWN.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.595
WE'RE THE AREA IN WHICH WE ARE

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:56.464
INCREASING EMISSIONS MOST EVERY

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:57.398
DAY IN THE STATE IS IN

01:28:57.465 --> 01:28:59.200
TRANSPORTATION AND LIGHT DUTY

01:28:59.267 --> 01:29:00.368
VEHICLES PEOPLE TRAVELING.

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:02.103
FARTHER AND FARTHER TO GET FROM

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:02.804
HOME TO WORK TO GET FROM HOME TO

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:04.605
SCHOOL THESE ARE INTER RELATED

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:06.140
ISSUES AND WE CAN'T RISK OUR

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:06.974
CLIMATE GOALS.

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:09.010
BY NOT ADDRESSING THIS LARGER

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:11.179
CRISIS OF HOUSING AND LONG TERM

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:12.980
DEVELOPMENT.

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.315
SO ALL OF THESE KIND OF ISSUES

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:16.617
CAN TO GOD CAME TOGETHER IN --

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.486
THE REPORT THAT RECENTLY CAME

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:19.253
OUT FROM THE WILD FIRE STRIKE

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.089
FORCE OF THE ENERGY STRIKE FORCE

01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:22.390
TEAM OF THE GOVERNOR WHICH BOTH

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:23.257
CHIEF PORTER.

01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:26.127
AND I WERE PART OF ANY IN THAT

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.962
REPORT -- ONE SET OF

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:29.731
RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ACTUALLY ON

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:31.532
LAND USE THE REPORT DID SURFACE

01:29:31.599 --> 01:29:32.734
SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND MAKE

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.335
THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:35.903
FIRST OF THAT STATE AND REGIONAL

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:37.038
GOVERNMENTS IN PLAINER SHOULD

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:38.439
INCORPORATE CAL FIRES RISK

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:40.374
PROJECTIONS AS WELL AS FIRE

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:41.275
PROJECTIONS IN CLIMATE

01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:42.577
PROJECTIONS FROM THE ADAPTATION

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:43.911
CLEARING HOUSE AND FOR CLIMATE

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:45.012
ASSESSMENT.

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:46.247
INTO SHORT AND LONG TERM

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:47.548
PLANNING THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN'T

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:50.284
THINK OF THIS AS A LUXURY.

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:52.420
OR A SIDE ISSUE TO INCORPORATE

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:53.888
THESE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS BUT

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:55.189
THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:29:55.256 --> 01:29:56.958
CRITICAL IN TERMS OF

01:29:57.024 --> 01:30:01.129
UNDERSTANDING THE REST TO

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:01.629
DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS IN

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:02.764
COMMUNITIES.

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:04.031
BOB WE I IN THAT REPORT THE

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:04.665
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE MADE THE CASE

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:05.533
THAT WE SHOULD BE.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.869
DE PRIORITIZE A NEW DEVELOPMENT

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:10.204
IN VERY HIGH RISK EXTREME VIRUS

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:11.372
CARRIES OF THE STATE.

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.641
AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENCOURAGING

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:15.409
DEVELOPMENT AS THE GOVERNOR'S

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:16.811
OFFICE IS DOING AND MANY OF YOU

01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:18.045
LEGISLATURE DOING.

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:20.748
PRIORITIZING I'M DEVELOPMENT AND

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.617
I EXISTING URBAN AREAS THAT ARE

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:23.484
LOWER.

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:26.053
IN ORDER TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE THE

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.555
HOUSING CRISIS WITHOUT PUTTING.

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:28.756
MORE AND MORE PRESSURE ON THESE

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:30.892
HIGH RISK SOUNDS.

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:33.194
WE ALSO -- OR THE REPORT ALSO

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.695
DIRECTED MY OFFICE OFFICE OF

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:35.963

01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:37.465
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT TO

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:38.733
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HIGH

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.967
FIRE RISK AND YOU IN TURN I

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:41.068
THINK WE'LL TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW

01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:42.069
WE'RE DOING THAT WE'RE DOING A

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:44.672
FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK IN THOSE

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:45.139
COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW.

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:46.140
ON THE GROUND.

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:46.908
I'M MANY OF THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.442
ARE RURAL AND UNDER RESOURCE TO

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:49.777
AND LACKING IN THE KIND OF

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.813
PLANNING CAPACITY THAT SOME OF

01:30:51.879 --> 01:30:52.780
THE MORE URBAN AREAS OF THE

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:53.447
STATE HOUSE.

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:54.916

TODAY'S ISSUE TO MARS ISSUE WILL

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.543
BE FLOODING AND THEN THE NEXT

01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:23.978
ISSUE WILL BE EXTREME HEAT AND

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:25.112
PASS AND THEN THE NEXT ISSUE

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:26.013
WILL BE.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.582
SEA LEVEL RISE IMPACTS ON OUR

AND MANY OF THOSE EFFORTS WERE

01:36:01.021 --> 01:36:02.389
TALKED ABOUT HERE BUT ALL HIGH

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:03.791
LIKE A COUPLE OF THOSE THAT

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:04.458
WE'VE BEEN IN YOU KNOW IN

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:06.026
PARTNERSHIP SPECIFICALLY WITH

BUT THE COUNCIL IS A REALLY A

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:14.368
GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:15.903
THAT DIALOGUE WITH OUR LOCAL

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:18.005
PARTNERS TO INFORM THE WORK THAT

WE'RE DOING ITS STATE AGENCIES.

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:23.010
SO OUR COUNCIL PROVIDES GUIDANCE

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:24.645
TO OPR INTO OUR ADAPTATION

01:36:24.712 --> 01:36:27.081
PROGRAM ON A BROAD ARRAY OF

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:28.682
RESILIENCE TOPICS AS WAS

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:30.017
MENTIONED YOU KNOW WILD FIRES

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:32.153
ONE OF MANY MANY CLIMATE IMPACTS

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:34.155
HERE -- BUT WHAT KEY AREA

01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:36.090
ESPECIALLY FOR THE OVER THE LAST

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:38.325
YEAR OR SO HAS BEEN OUR TOPIC

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:41.395
HAS BEEN AROUND SB THREE SEVENTY

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:43.364
NINE AND HOW LOCALS ARE ACTUALLY

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:45.599
MOVING FORWARD IN IMPLEMENTING.

01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:47.034
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR IN THEIR

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:48.936
GENERAL PLAN AND TRYING TO

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:50.271
BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE SOME

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:51.906
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:53.207
IN ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.341
INCORPORATE CLIMB INTO THEIR

01:36:54.408 --> 01:36:55.776
GENERAL PLANS.

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:59.180
AND THE THE ISSUE OF PRE AND

01:36:59.246 --> 01:37:00.814
POST WILD FIRE PLANNING HAVE

01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:03.217
BEEN TWO VERY IMPORTANT TOPICS

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:03.984
THAT HAVE COME UP THROUGH THE

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.419
COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION WITH

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:07.788
OUR COUNCIL AND THE WORK FOR

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:08.722
DOING IT -- PR.

01:37:08.789 --> 01:37:10.524
SO ONE AREA THAT I WANT TO TOUCH

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:13.761
ON THAT -- WAS MENTIONED HERE --

01:37:13.827 --> 01:37:15.796
BUT EARLIER IS THAT WE'VE DONE A

01:37:15.863 --> 01:37:17.464
FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK TO TRY TO

01:37:17.531 --> 01:37:19.166
BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE

01:37:19.233 --> 01:37:20.901
FACTORS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:22.336
DRIVING VULNERABILITY WITHIN

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:24.772
COMMUNITIES RECOGNIZING THAT

01:37:24.838 --> 01:37:27.508
UNDERLYING SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:29.310
AS WELL AS YOU KNOW ACCESS IN

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:30.811
OUR BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:32.479
AND OTHER UNDERLYING CONDITIONS

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:35.182
ARE JUST EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE

01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:36.617
IMPACTS SO WE GO THROUGH OUR

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:38.219
COUNCIL HAVE DEVELOPED A

01:37:38.285 --> 01:37:39.286
DEFINITION FOR VULNERABLE

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:41.555
COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS GUIDANCE

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:42.990
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:37:43.057 --> 01:37:44.725
IN THEIR PLANNING PROCESS SEES

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.827
ON HOW TO MAKE THAT DEFINITION

01:37:46.894 --> 01:37:48.362
ACTIONABLE IN THEIR WORK.

01:37:48.429 --> 01:37:50.431
AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:52.299
CAL FIRE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:54.034
THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT TO

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:55.169
MAKE SURE THAT WORK AND THE

01:37:55.236 --> 01:37:56.770
INPUT THAT CAME THROUGH THAT

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:58.072
PROCESS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:37:58.138 --> 01:37:59.840
WAS REFLECTED IN THAT STATE

01:37:59.907 --> 01:38:01.642
EFFORT.

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:04.812
SO RETURNING BACK TO SB THREE

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:05.379
SEVENTY NINE AND THE GENERAL

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:07.681
PLAN WE KNOW THATFOR MANY LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS THREE SEVENTY NINE

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.252
AND MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:12.920
WILL REALLY BE THE FIRST TIME

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:14.655
THAT THEY ARE INCORPORATING.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:15.623
CLIMATE INTO THEIR COMIC

01:38:15.689 --> 01:38:17.391
ADAPTATION INTO THEIR GENERAL

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:18.359
PLAN.

01:38:18.425 --> 01:38:20.227

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:22.830
REQUIREMENT IN BETTER

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:31.939
INFORMATION IN.

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:34.475
SO WE ARE EMBARKING ON DOING

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:36.076
KIND OF A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.511
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND TO

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:39.213
ENGAGE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

ENABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MEET

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:51.592
THOSE REQUIREMENTS --

01:38:51.659 --> 01:38:53.460
ANECDOTALLY WE'VE HEARD THAT YOU

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:56.063

ARE AND YOU KNOW RUNNING INTO

01:38:58.198 --> 01:38:59.400
STICKING POINTS WITH SOME OF THE

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:00.768
TECHNICAL ASPECTS AND

01:39:00.834 --> 01:39:02.736
PARTICULARLY RUNNING INTO SOME

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.305
OF THE CHALLENGES OF HOW TO

01:39:04.371 --> 01:39:06.273
INCORPORATE CLIMATE PROJECTIONS.

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:08.542
INTO PLANNING GIVEN THE LEVEL OF

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:11.111
UNCERTAINTY AND ALSO COMPOUNDING

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:13.714
ISSUES BETWEEN CLIMATE BUILT

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:16.350
INFRASTRUCTURE YOU KNOW AND ALSO --

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:18.085
YOU KNOW CASCADING IMPACTS OF

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:19.887
CLIMATE LIKE WILDFIRE AND

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:22.523
FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES -- AND

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:24.391
HOW THAT HOW DO YOU INCORPORATE

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:26.160
THAT INTO YOUR PLANNING EFFORTS.

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:27.661
SO ONE OTHER AREA THAT ALL

01:39:27.728 --> 01:39:29.596
BRIEFLY TOUCH ON IS WE'VE DONE A

01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:30.731
FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK WITH OUR

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.299
FEDERAL AND STATE PARTNERS TO

01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:33.667
ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW WE SUPPORT

01:39:33.734 --> 01:39:35.102
PLAN ALIGNMENT.

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:36.236
AND THIS IS WHERE THROUGH A

01:39:36.303 --> 01:39:37.905
GREAT PARTNERSHIP WITH CALLAWAY

01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:39.707
YES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK VERY

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:41.909
CLOSELY AROUND HOW WE SUPPORT

01:39:41.975 --> 01:39:44.011
ALIGNMENT BETWEEN GUIDANCE WE'RE

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:46.080
GIVING ON THE GENERAL PLANS --

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:47.181
YES IS GIVING ON LOCAL HAZARD

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:48.949
MITIGATION PLANS AND REALLY

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:49.817
WORKING TO IDENTIFY

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.785
OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE THESE

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:53.554
LOCAL PLANS AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.255
THEY'RE SUPPORTIVE OF BOTH NEAR

01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:57.458
TERM AND LONG TERM CLIMATE AND

01:39:57.524 --> 01:40:03.964
PLANNING GOALS -- WE ALSO --

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:06.300
THIS BRINGS ME TO MY AS A SORRY

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:07.568
THIS POINT ON PLAN ALIGNMENT

01:40:07.634 --> 01:40:08.135
ALSO BRINGS ME NOW THE LAST

01:40:08.202 --> 01:40:09.336
POINT ABOUT OUR WORK THROUGH I

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:11.004
CARP WHICH IS.

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:12.339
REALLY WORKING TO COORDINATE

01:40:12.406 --> 01:40:14.641
STATE EFFORTS SO MANY STATE

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:17.111
AGENCIES ISSUE A LOT OF GUIDANCE

01:40:17.177 --> 01:40:18.612
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THERE

01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:19.980
ARE A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS THERE

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:21.281
I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:22.516
REALLY BEEN FOCUSING ON IS HOW

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:23.784
WE BRING.

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.586
OUR STATE PARTNERS TOGETHER SO

01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:26.954
THAT IN WHEN WE'RE ISSUING

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.022
GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES TO LOCALS

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:32.459

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:33.327
THEIR NEEDS.

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:35.396
SO THE LAST POINT -- BEFORE I

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:37.698
CONCLUDE HERE IS THAT I WANT TO

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:39.767
JUST MENTION THAT OPR IS WORKING

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:41.301

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:18.732
HAVE EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:21.301

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:25.305
ORGANIZED.

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:27.074
BLOCK CAPTAINS AND EVERYBODY

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.375
KNOWS WHAT TO DO AN EMERGENCY

01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:29.610
KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH

01:42:29.676 --> 01:42:31.845
KINDERGARTEN KIDS BUT YOU KNOW

01:42:32.446 --> 01:42:33.580
COMMUNITIES.

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:35.015
AND WE HAVE OUR SEARCH PROGRAM

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:36.550
WHICH SOME PEOPLE DO AND WHICH

01:42:36.617 --> 01:42:38.285
IS GREAT BUT TENDS TO BE KIND OF

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:39.753
FUNDED THE NOT FUNDED AN ACTIVE

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.055
NOT ACTIVE IN ITS VOLUNTARY AND

01:42:42.122 --> 01:42:43.690
YOU MAY HAVE ONE PERSON ONE AREA

01:42:43.757 --> 01:42:45.425
THAT'S DONE IT BUT THE REST OF

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:46.159
PEOPLE ON THE BLOCK DON'T.

01:42:46.226 --> 01:42:48.295
EVEN KNOW SO IS A TIME FOR US TO

01:42:48.362 --> 01:42:51.565
THINK ABOUT IN SOME AREAS A MORE.

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:54.735
COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE PROGRAM

01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:56.637
THAT IS NOT VOLUNTARY FOR PEOPLE

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:58.572
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE DRILLS

01:42:58.639 --> 01:42:59.773
AND HAVE TO LEARN WHAT TO DO IN

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.208
AN EMERGENCY AND WHAT THEIR ROLE

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:03.477
IS AND WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S

01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:07.180

QUITE A BIT IN JAPAN AND AND AND

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:15.088
WORK WITH THE JAPANESE

01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:16.757
GOVERNMENT -- AND WE'VE GOT

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:19.326
PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE JAPANESE --

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:20.727
EIGHT FIRST OF ALL -- THEY THEY

01:43:20.794 --> 01:43:24.865
DO HAVE -- A VERY EXTENSIVE.

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:25.866
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM --

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:27.134
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.169
DIFFERENT CULTURE THAN WE DO --

01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:31.505
AND AND THEIR THEIR CULTURE IS

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:36.777
IS ONE OF OF BATES -- YOU KNOW I

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:38.178
DON'T WANT BANKS HAVE TRIED MY

01:43:38.245 --> 01:43:39.313
BEST WORDS BUT YOU KNOW THEY

01:43:39.379 --> 01:43:41.181
IT'S A COMPLIANCE.

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:43.517
MORE COMPLIANT CULTURE -- THEY

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:45.118
START AT A VERY YOUNG AGE

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:46.553
PRESCHOOL AND AND AND START

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.055
START TRAINING.

01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:50.691
ALL ON THE FACT PREDOMINANTLY

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:51.992
EARTHQUAKE RELATED BECAUSE THEY

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.627
HAVE HUGE EARTHQUAKES IN JAPAN

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:55.128
AND SO -- EARTHQUAKE

01:43:55.195 --> 01:43:56.697
PREPAREDNESS IS ONE OF THEIR

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:59.533
HUGE -- FOCUS POINTS -- THEY

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.667
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OTHER KINDS

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:03.003
DESPERATE TSUNAMI IS ANOTHER ONE

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:05.973
THAT THEY FOCUS IN ON AND THEIR

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.507
THEIR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.

01:44:07.574 --> 01:44:10.077
DOES -- FIND A SIGNIFICANT

01:44:10.143 --> 01:44:15.949
AMOUNT OF OF EFFORT TO PROVIDE

01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:17.985
TRAININGS AND IT BECOMES A THEIR

01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:19.052
CULTURE A SENSE OF COMMUNITY

01:44:19.119 --> 01:44:22.122
PRIDE. TO BE ABLE TO BUILD BLOCK.

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:24.257
CAPTAINS IN BLOCK TEAMS -- AND

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:25.325
THEY ACTUALLY ACT WE ACTUALLY

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:27.961
HAVE -- COMPETITIONS.

THINK THAT -- ONE OF THE

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:38.905
GREATEST THINGS THAT WE CAN --

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:40.974
ENCOURAGE IS BUILDING A CULTURE

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:44.411
PREPAREDNESS -- WE DO.

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:47.147
IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY -- AND NOT

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:48.949
AS A COMPLETE A COMPLIANT -- AS

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:51.485
THE JAPANESE ARE BUT YOU LOOK AT

01:44:51.551 --> 01:44:54.521

01:44:57.591 --> 01:44:59.359
PREPAREDNESS DOC -- DROP COVER

01:44:59.426 --> 01:45:01.128
AND HOLD SCHOOL KIDS START TO DO

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:02.629
THAT THEY THEY LEARNED THAT

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:03.664
THROUGH THEIR WHOLE LIVES IN

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:04.431
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EARTHQUAKE

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:09.302
RISK -- WILDFIRE DROP -- AND

01:45:09.369 --> 01:45:12.739
ROLL THAT'S RIGHT.

01:45:12.806 --> 01:45:13.340
I MAKE SURE I GOT IT STOP DROP

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:16.510
AND ROLL -- I I I I THINK

01:45:16.576 --> 01:45:17.177
THERE'S A BENEFIT THOUGH FOR US

01:45:17.244 --> 01:45:20.781
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR YOU

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:22.582
KNOW DEPARTMENT OF ADS.

01:45:22.649 --> 01:45:23.483
ONCE YOU BUILD THAT INTO THE

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:24.851
YOUTH AND IT STARTS TO COME

01:45:24.918 --> 01:45:26.286
FORWARD AND IF IT GETS

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:27.888
REINFORCED OVER AND ALL AND THEN

01:45:27.954 --> 01:45:29.289
IT'S PRACTICED.

01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:31.224
AS THEY GET OLDER -- IN

01:45:31.291 --> 01:45:33.093
BUSINESSES EXCEPT -- FOR AND I

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.327
THOUGHT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE

01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:36.263
PROBABLY HAD THE BEST COMPLIANCE

01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:37.964
FOR THIS IN THE AREA OF

01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:39.332
EARTHQUAKE AS WELL SO WE HAVE

01:45:39.399 --> 01:45:39.533
THAT.

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:42.069
THE THE THE THE SHAKE OUT EVERY

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:43.303
YEAR -- WE'VE GOT MILLIONS OF

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:45.238
PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN THAT --

01:45:45.305 --> 01:45:47.841
SCHOOLS BUSINESSES EXCEPT.

01:45:47.908 --> 01:45:49.076
FOR AND AND IN YOU A STRESS

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:50.744
AGENTS IN YOUR COMMUNITY REALLY

01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:52.179
ARE GREAT REPRESENTATION TO GET

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:54.448
COMMUNITIES TO FOCUS IN ON

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:56.483
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS.

01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:58.618
OF FUNDING MICE YOU KNOW IT HAS

01:45:58.685 --> 01:45:59.720
BEEN HIT AND MESSES UP AND DOWN

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:01.254
DEPENDS ON WHERE WE CAN GET THE

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:03.490
FUNDING -- TO BE ABLE TO DO IT --

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:04.758
IT IS I WOULD JUST SAY NOT

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:07.327
CONSISTENT ACROSS THE BOARD BUT

01:46:07.394 --> 01:46:08.662
YOU KNOW BETWEEN OUR FEDERAL

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:10.964
PARTNERS IN WHAT WE GET FROM FOR

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:12.799
STATE TAB PROGRAMS AND WHAT

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:14.901
LOCALS THEMSELVES PUT INTO IT --

01:46:14.968 --> 01:46:19.473
YOU KNOW WE TRY TO GET THE JOB

01:46:19.539 --> 01:46:20.407
DONE.

01:46:20.474 --> 01:46:22.008
I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO

01:46:22.075 --> 01:46:22.676
UNDERSTAND THAT -- WHAT WORKS IN

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:23.276
ONE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:46:23.343 --> 01:46:25.145
ALTERED? FOR THE CULTURE OF OUR

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:27.414
STATE -- AND WE DO OFFER

01:46:27.481 --> 01:46:28.682
TRAINING IN THERE OR SOMETHING

01:46:28.749 --> 01:46:31.251
SO PEOPLE KNOW -- BUT I HAVING

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:32.719
BEEN THROUGH SOME EARTHQUAKES

01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:35.188
AND OTHER DISASTERS MYSELF -- A

01:46:35.255 --> 01:46:37.023
LOT OF PEOPLE KIND OF KNOWING

01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:39.126
HOW TO DO SOME THINGS BUT THEN

01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:40.560
FEELING COMPLETELY ON THEIR OWN

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:42.129
AND NOT HAVING ANY ORGANIZED

01:46:42.195 --> 01:46:44.498
STRUCTURE -- AFTER EMERGENCY

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:46.466
HITS AND SORT OF WAITING FOR

01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:48.268
PEOPLE TO RESCUE THEM -- I THINK

01:46:48.335 --> 01:46:50.203
WE NEED TO I PERSONALLY THINK WE

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:51.972
HAVE TO RETHINK THAT STRATEGY --

01:46:52.038 --> 01:46:53.507
YOU KNOW I REMEMBERED IN THE IN

01:46:53.573 --> 01:46:54.875
THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE AND I HAD

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:55.742
JUST MOVED OUT.

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:57.144
RECENTLY WITH WATCHING PEOPLE

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:58.779
DRIVE.

01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:00.614
LIKE MANIACS UP AND DOWN DEAD

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:01.948
END STREETS TRYING TO FIND A WAY

01:47:02.015 --> 01:47:03.617
OUT OF LOS ANGELES AND PEOPLE

01:47:03.683 --> 01:47:05.519
AND FEELING MYSELF COMPLETELY

01:47:05.585 --> 01:47:06.787
ISOLATED.

01:47:06.853 --> 01:47:09.956
AND ALONE AND HAVING NO IDEA.

01:47:10.023 --> 01:47:11.057
WHAT TO DO IF YOU KNOW SORT OF

01:47:11.124 --> 01:47:12.492
THINGS HAD GONE ON LONGER IN

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:13.960
TERMS OF POWER BEING OUT THAT

01:47:14.027 --> 01:47:15.762
KIND OF THING SO?

01:47:15.829 --> 01:47:17.197
I THINK THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:18.832
NO MORE ORGANIZATION OF

01:47:18.899 --> 01:47:20.500
COMMUNITIES -- ON THE GROUND I

01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:21.434
DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT OR

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:22.569
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT I THINK

01:47:22.636 --> 01:47:26.373
pBUILDING OFF OF I'M NOT TO

01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:27.374
SWITCH TO HOUSING I MEAN

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.809
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THIS TENSION

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:30.844
NOW BETWEEN OUR DESIRE TO BUILD

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:32.112
THE HOUSING THAT WE NEED.

01:47:32.179 --> 01:47:34.214
AND FIGURING OUT WHERE TO BUILD

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:36.316
IT AND YOU EVERYBODY LOVES TO

01:47:36.383 --> 01:47:37.350
TALK ABOUT DOING MORE BUILDING

01:47:37.417 --> 01:47:38.618
BUT WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:47:38.685 --> 01:47:40.153
INDIVIDUAL CITIES ENTITLING

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.355
PROJECTS IN OUR URBAN AREAS WE

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:44.424
SEE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:46.259
RESISTANCE FROM PEOPLE.

01:47:46.326 --> 01:47:47.260
I JUST TODAY IN THE LA TIMES

01:47:47.327 --> 01:47:49.229
THERE WAS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:50.363
HOW SOME OF WHAT SOMEHOW

01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:51.731
BUILDING TALLER BUILDINGS IT'S

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:52.933
GOING TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:55.869
SKATEBOARDING ON SIDEWALKS AND

01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:57.103
PLAYING BALL IN THE STREET AND

01:47:57.170 --> 01:47:58.705
JUST YOU YOU HEARD HEARING CRAZY

01:47:58.772 --> 01:48:00.140
ARGUMENTS AGAINST BUILDING

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:01.474
HOUSING SO PEOPLE ARE BEING

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:01.708
FORCED.

01:48:01.775 --> 01:48:02.943
FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT.

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:04.444
BUT HOW DO WE YOU KNOW DON'T WE

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:05.812
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TO JUST

01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:07.147
SORT OF STOP BUILDING IF IT'S

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:08.248
GOING TO BE IN AREAS THAT ARE

01:48:08.315 --> 01:48:10.050
NOT DEFENSIBLE I MEAN IS A COME

01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:11.284
IS IT JUST THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE.

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:12.586
WHATEVER BUILDINGS

01:48:12.652 --> 01:48:15.422
MUNICIPALITIES WANT TO DO -- AS

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:16.790
DEFENSIBLE AS POSSIBLE OR IS

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:17.824
THERE A POINT AT WHICH WE SAY

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:19.159
YOU KNOW WHAT THESE AREAS ARE

01:48:19.226 --> 01:48:20.527
JUST GOING TO BE OFF LIMITS TO

01:48:20.594 --> 01:48:22.996
DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT'S JUST

01:48:23.063 --> 01:48:26.466
GOING TO BE TOO DANGEROUS DO YOU

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:26.733
HAVE ANY.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.869
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

01:48:28.935 --> 01:48:29.903
THANK -- NO I THINK IT'S IT'S A

01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:30.503
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT IN AND

01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:32.072
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS

01:48:32.138 --> 01:48:33.940
ISSUE OF COURSE IS THAT A LOT OF

01:48:34.007 --> 01:48:36.343
PEOPLE ALREADY LIVE IN THESE

01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:38.445
AREAS I THINK -- AND AND I YOU

01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:39.546
ALL CAN CORRECT ME IF THIS IS

01:48:39.613 --> 01:48:40.780
WRONG BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:42.883
THE VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS

01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:44.985
IT'S ABOUT TWO POINT. FOUR OR

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:46.686
SOMETHING MILLION PEOPLE AND IF

01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:47.754
YOU LOOK AT JUST THE WE WE

01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:49.356
GENERALLY IT'S LIKE ELEVEN

01:48:49.422 --> 01:48:50.991
MILLION PEOPLE SO IT'S A VERY

01:48:51.057 --> 01:48:53.927
LARGE POPULATION OF OF

01:48:53.994 --> 01:48:54.527
CALIFORNIA THAT'S ALREADY IN

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:55.428
THESE AREAS.

01:48:55.495 --> 01:48:56.863
SO WE'RE NOT OBVIOUSLY IN A

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:59.966
POSITION I KNOW ONE WOULD SAY

01:49:00.033 --> 01:49:01.001
THAT WERE IN A POSITION TO SAY.

01:49:01.067 --> 01:49:02.669
YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE RETREATING

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:04.704
IN SOMEWHERE RIGHT -- THE

01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:06.206
QUESTION BECOMES.

01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:08.375
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DEFENSIBLE

01:49:08.441 --> 01:49:09.910
AND DEFENSIBLE WITH THE RIGHT

01:49:09.976 --> 01:49:11.645
KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT YOU ALL

01:49:11.711 --> 01:49:13.747
HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND AND WITH I

01:49:13.813 --> 01:49:15.282
THINK MUCH STRONGER?

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:16.216
YOU KNOW FRANKLY MUCH STRONGER

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:17.651
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER

01:49:17.717 --> 01:49:19.786
RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAKING ON

01:49:19.853 --> 01:49:20.887
SOME OF THE DEFENSE OF SPACE

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:23.456
WITH HELP SOME OF THE

01:49:23.523 --> 01:49:24.691
DIFFERENCES SPACE WHICH IS ALSO.

01:49:24.758 --> 01:49:26.026
IN OUR OPEN SPACE AREAS THAT ARE

01:49:26.092 --> 01:49:28.295
GOING TO BE BUILT IN SO IT'S NOT

01:49:28.361 --> 01:49:29.296
YES SO THIS IS NOT YOUR LOOK OUT

01:49:29.362 --> 01:49:30.897
AND FILL IN ALREADY DEVELOPED

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:32.465
AREAS RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT AND SO

01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:33.700
GOING TO THE OTHER PART IS SORT

01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:35.035
OF LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH PLACES

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:36.036
THAT HAVE NOT.

01:49:36.102 --> 01:49:37.837
YET BEEN DEVELOPED SLASH --

01:49:37.904 --> 01:49:41.808
PLACES THAT ARE -- OR ARE REALLY

01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:44.811
REALLY HIGH RISK AND I THINK

01:49:44.878 --> 01:49:45.745
IT'S A REALLY.

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:47.213
GOOD QUESTION I MEAN AGAIN THE

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.214
THE THE GOVERNOR STRIPPERS

01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:49.783
REPORT I THINK WENT.

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:50.917
FURTHER THAN MANY THINGS HAVE

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:52.919
GONE IN THE PAST BY EVEN SAYING

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:54.487
WE SHOULD DISCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT.

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:57.057
IN SOME OF THESE HIGH RISK AREAS --

01:49:57.123 --> 01:49:57.757
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO

01:49:57.824 --> 01:49:59.259
DISCOURAGE I THINK PART OF WHAT

01:49:59.326 --> 01:50:01.027
THAT LOOKS LIKE IS INCREASE IS

01:50:01.094 --> 01:50:02.295
ENCOURAGING IT ELSEWHERE?

01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:04.564
SO ONE THING WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT

01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:07.167
AT OPR IS BARRIERS TO DEVELOPING

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:09.536
THE KIND OF INFILL HOUSING THAT

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:10.170
WE ALL TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME

01:50:10.236 --> 01:50:12.305
AND I THINK THIS STATE I THINK

01:50:12.372 --> 01:50:13.606
WE ALL KNOW THE STATE IS IN A

01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:14.874
POSITION TO LOOK AT LOWERING

01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:15.775
SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS.

01:50:15.842 --> 01:50:17.043
ON TO THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:18.144
SO THAT YOU'RE NOT PUTTING

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.879
DEVELOPERS IN A POSITION WHERE

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:21.314
IT'S JUST CHEAPER AND EASIER.

01:50:21.381 --> 01:50:23.516
FRANKLY TO BE IN A GREEN FIELD --

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:26.286
OPEN SPACE AREA ONE OTHER THING

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:27.620
THAT THAT FEEDS IN AND I DIDN'T

01:50:27.687 --> 01:50:28.288
SAID EARLIER BUT IT'S AN

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:29.222
IMPORTANT POINT TO FEES IN THIS

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:30.924
CONVERSATION WE KNOW FROM SOME

01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:31.691
OF THE FIRES THAT IT JUST

01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:33.093
HAPPENED THAT ACTUALLY

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:35.762
AGRICULTURE LAND.

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:37.964
WAS A BUFFER -- THAT STOP FIRE

01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:39.165
FROM SPREADING IN SOME PARTS OF

01:50:39.232 --> 01:50:40.333
THE STATE AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.368
PART OF THIS CONVERSATION IS HOW

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:43.303
DO WE PROTECT.

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:44.971
AGRICULTURE LAND THAT'S A BUFFER

01:50:45.038 --> 01:50:46.706
IN THESE HIGH RISK SITUATIONS AS

01:50:46.773 --> 01:50:48.308
WELL AS BEING PART OF THAT THE

01:50:48.375 --> 01:50:49.609
ECONOMY SO I THINK.

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:50.877
IT'S SORT OF WHAT THIS DOES IS

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:52.278
OPEN THE DOOR TO KIND OF JUST

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:53.179
TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A STEP

01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:54.914
BACK AND HAVING THIS LARGER

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:56.816
CONVERSATION ABOUT [inaudible]

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:58.418
WHERE IS?

01:50:58.485 --> 01:50:59.786
WHERE IS DEVELOPMENT MAKE THE

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:02.022
MOST SENSE -- AND WHERE DO WE AS

01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:03.256
A STATE WANT TO THINK ABOUT

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:05.425
WHERE ARE RISKS AND LIABILITIES

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:06.793
ARE AS WELL AS RECENT

01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:07.761
LIABILITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS I

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:09.195
DON'T HAVE THE PERFECT ANSWER ON

01:51:09.262 --> 01:51:11.531
THAT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT

01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:13.233
IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION.

01:51:13.299 --> 01:51:14.267
AND I JUST HAVE TWO MORE

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:16.302
QUESTIONS IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME

01:51:16.369 --> 01:51:16.903
JUST TWO MORE QUICK ONES THANK

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:20.407
YOU -- BUT SO WE DON'T PROHIBIT

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:21.975
DEVELOPMENT IN THESE AREAS WE

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:23.309
SORT OF WE DO LEAVE IT UP TO

01:51:23.376 --> 01:51:25.345
DISABILITIES AND COMING FROM

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:26.279
LOCAL GOVERNMENT I'VE NEVER SEEN

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:27.847
A PROJECT IS APPROVED FROM

01:51:27.914 --> 01:51:29.149
BECAUSE OF FIRE RESCUE NO NO

01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:30.750
MATTER HOW REMOTE.

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:32.786
IT SEEMED -- EVEN VERY LARGE

01:51:32.852 --> 01:51:34.687
DEVELOPMENTS WE DECIDED TO

01:51:34.754 --> 01:51:35.989
TWENTY THOUSAND UNIT DEVELOPMENT

01:51:36.056 --> 01:51:37.090
APPROVED AND MARK YOU KNOW

01:51:37.157 --> 01:51:41.294
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES -- AND WE

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:41.861
DO RECOVER.

01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:42.529
BETTER BUILDING REQUIREMENTS NOW

01:51:42.595 --> 01:51:43.563
WE HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.298
REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE A LOT OF OF

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:46.900
THE STANDARDS BUT WHAT IS THE

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:47.734
OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT

01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:49.369
MECHANISM I MEAN WHO ACTUALLY

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:50.970
GOES OUT AND DECIDES WHETHER AND

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:52.338
NEW DEVELOPMENT.

01:51:52.405 --> 01:51:54.374
IS UP TO THOSE STANDARDS AND IF

01:51:54.441 --> 01:51:56.810
THEY'RE NOT WHAT HAPPENS AND WHO

01:51:56.876 --> 01:52:01.714
WOULD ENFORCE THAT. FOR FIRED

01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:02.749
FOR ALL OF OUR FIRE WITH FIRE.

01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:05.485
WELL. FOR CAL FIRE ALL WE DO IS

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:08.321
IS WE PRIDE PROVIDE INFORMATION

01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:10.657
CONSOLE -- WE DON'T WE DON'T

01:52:10.723 --> 01:52:12.592
MAKE A RECOMMENDATION WE DON'T

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:15.762
DECIDE FOR THEM -- YOU KNOW WE

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:16.329
CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH A FIRE

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:17.397
HISTORY.

01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:18.631
WE CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH THE

01:52:18.698 --> 01:52:20.633
FIRE WEATHER -- WE CAN PROVIDE

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:21.968
THEM WITH THE ELEMENTS THAT THAT

01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:24.337
LEAD TO THE TO THE HAZARD.

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:25.805
AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:28.108
MITIGATING RISK BUT THE DECISION

01:52:28.174 --> 01:52:29.676
TO BUILD IS A IS A LOCAL

01:52:29.742 --> 01:52:32.045
DECISION.

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:32.779
IT JUST ADDED THAT I THINK

01:52:32.846 --> 01:52:34.080
THAT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:35.982
IN AND THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY

01:52:36.049 --> 01:52:37.417
STRONG INTEREST IN CONTINUING

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:39.752
WITH LOCAL KIND OF VERY LOCALLY

01:52:39.819 --> 01:52:40.987
SPECIFIC.

01:52:41.054 --> 01:52:42.655
APPROACHES TO LONG RANGE

01:52:42.722 --> 01:52:44.257
PLANNING THAT ARE THAT ARE.

01:52:44.324 --> 01:52:45.925
RELEVANT TO LOCAL AREAS.

01:52:45.992 --> 01:52:47.227
I WILL SAY THAT PLACES THAT HAVE

01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:48.228
BEEN THROUGH THIS IT'S

01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:49.462
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:50.563
IN A ROSE IS A REALLY

01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:51.965
INTERESTING EXAMPLE ALSO CENTER

01:52:52.031 --> 01:52:54.567
IS OBVIOUSLY.

01:52:54.634 --> 01:52:55.635
WENT THROUGH A VERY.

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:57.337
STRESSFUL AND TRAGIC FIRE

01:52:57.403 --> 01:53:00.106
SITUATION IN A WHAT THEY WOULD

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:01.808
NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF AS A FIRE

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:04.144
AREA RIGHT I MEAN THOSE THOSE

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:05.612
NEIGHBORHOODS WERE NOT FORESTED.

01:53:05.678 --> 01:53:08.515
COMMUNITY -- BUT WHAT SANTA ROSA

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:09.415
HAS DONE AND I THINK IT'S

01:53:09.482 --> 01:53:10.817
INSTRUCTIVE JUST FROM A LOCAL

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:12.318
LEVEL WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN TERMS

01:53:12.385 --> 01:53:13.720
OF REBUILDING.

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:15.655
THEY FIRST OF ALL -- HAVE REALLY

01:53:15.722 --> 01:53:16.756
REDUCE BARRIERS ONE OF THE

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:18.525
BIGGEST BARRIERS THAT WE SEE IN

01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:19.359
A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE

01:53:19.425 --> 01:53:19.959
ON THIS.

01:53:20.026 --> 01:53:21.961
LOCAL LOCAL ZONING AND PLANNING

01:53:22.028 --> 01:53:23.329
IS PROBABLY THE LARGEST BARRIER

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:25.098
TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT A LOT OF

01:53:25.165 --> 01:53:26.633
PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY IT SEEK WELL

01:53:26.699 --> 01:53:29.769
BUT MOST OF THE MOST THE THE DAY

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:31.437
EVIDENCE IS NOT BEAR THAT OUT

01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:32.572
ITS LOCAL ZONING PLANNING.

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:36.042
CENTER IS A REDUCED THEIR PERMIT.

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:37.744
DAYS FROM BIG FINALLY PERMIT TO

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:40.213
A PERMIT -- APPLICATION TO FIVE

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:44.350
DAYS.

01:53:44.417 --> 01:53:45.418
BUT MY QUESTION WAS NOT ABOUT.

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:46.653
ROSS IS MY QUESTION WAS IF A

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:47.320
LOCAL COMMUNITY IS RIGHT IT IS

01:53:47.387 --> 01:53:48.421
NOT FIRE FOLLOWING THE FIRE

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:50.089
REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN

01:53:50.156 --> 01:53:51.891
PLACE.

01:53:51.958 --> 01:53:54.260
WHO ENFORCES WHO MODULE?

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:55.528
OVER WHO WHO'S OVER WHO IS

01:53:55.595 --> 01:53:57.297
OVERSIGHT OF THAT AND WHO IN

01:53:57.363 --> 01:53:59.432
FORCES -- WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:02.769
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT IS

01:54:02.835 --> 01:54:04.170
THE MECHANISM?

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:06.105
THE GOVERNING BODY WOULD BE THE

01:54:06.172 --> 01:54:08.141
ENTITY THAT ENFORCES. TO ENSURE

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:10.210
THAT THE FIRE AGENCIES ENFORCING

01:54:10.276 --> 01:54:12.045
AND IF A COMMUNITY IS NOT HAVING

01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:13.146
THAT OVERSIGHT.

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:14.080
I'M SELF IF FOR WHATEVER REASON

01:54:14.147 --> 01:54:15.548
THEY'RE NOT DOING IT DON'T HAVE

01:54:15.615 --> 01:54:17.150
THE FUNDING TO DO IT DON'T HAVE

01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:18.151
THE WHERE WITH ALL WE JUST

01:54:18.218 --> 01:54:19.786
CHOOSE NOT TO IS THERE ANY OTHER

01:54:19.852 --> 01:54:21.254
OVERSIGHT THAT CAN COME IN.

01:54:21.321 --> 01:54:22.789
AND SAY YOU ARE NOT IN

01:54:22.855 --> 01:54:24.157
COMPLIANCE WITH EITHER BUILDING

01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:26.926
A A IN FORCING BUILDING CODES OR

01:54:26.993 --> 01:54:29.862
DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS.

01:54:29.929 --> 01:54:31.331
NOT FROM STATE OKAY.

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:33.366
GREAT LAST QUESTION I'M SB ONE

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:34.434
EIGHTY TWO DIED ON SENATOR

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.570
JACKSON REQUIRES THAT ALL --

01:54:37.637 --> 01:54:39.072
PARCELS WITHIN A DEVELOPMENT ARE

01:54:39.138 --> 01:54:40.273
SUBJECT TO AN ONGOING AND

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:42.675
PERMITTED FEE TAX OR ASSESSMENT.

01:54:42.742 --> 01:54:44.377
OR SOME SOMETHING SIMILAR TO

01:54:44.444 --> 01:54:45.712
ENSURE THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE

01:54:45.778 --> 01:54:48.381
MAINTENANCE A CURSE AND IS

01:54:48.448 --> 01:54:52.318
FUNDED -- SHOULD DEFENSIBLE

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:53.920
SPACE COMPLIANCE -- SHOULD

01:54:53.987 --> 01:54:55.188
COMMUNITY REQUIRED TO ENSURE

01:54:55.255 --> 01:54:56.489
THAT THAT WORK HAPPENS UP FRONT.

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:58.258
DO YOU THINK.

01:54:58.324 --> 01:55:00.260
OR IS IT OKAY FOR TO JUST KIND

01:55:00.326 --> 01:55:04.097
OF GO ON FOR YOU KNOW -- INDEX

01:55:04.163 --> 01:55:04.697
BE PUSHED OFF SORT OF INTO THE

01:55:04.764 --> 01:55:09.035
FUTURE.

01:55:09.102 --> 01:55:09.869
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FUNDING

01:55:09.936 --> 01:55:11.371
MECHANISM TO THINK THAT THAT

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:12.505
SHOULD BE.

01:55:12.572 --> 01:55:14.507
PAID UP FRONT CORD IS OVER THE

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:16.743
DEFENSIBLE SPACE OF A COMMUNITY

01:55:16.809 --> 01:55:18.478
OR DEFENSE YEAH FUNDING RECORD

01:55:18.544 --> 01:55:21.281
FOR THAT -- RELATED TO

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:25.084
DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICALLY -- THAT

01:55:25.151 --> 01:55:27.353
IS SOMETHING THAT THAT -- AGAIN

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.355
IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- AND WE

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:31.557
DON'T HAVE -- A ROLE IN

01:55:31.624 --> 01:55:33.259
DIFFERENT AND DEFINING THAT OR

01:55:33.326 --> 01:55:35.895
HOW THAT WOULD BE -- IMPLEMENTED

01:55:35.962 --> 01:55:41.067
AHEAD OF DURING AFTER -- AND

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:44.270
WHEN WE GET -- TO DEVELOPMENT IN

01:55:44.337 --> 01:55:45.772
THE S. R. A. ONCE IT IS

01:55:45.838 --> 01:55:48.107
DEVELOPED THEN -- DEFENSIBLE

01:55:48.174 --> 01:55:49.642
SPACE AROUND INDIVIDUAL

01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:53.046
STRUCTURES -- IS THE

01:55:53.112 --> 01:55:55.615
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OWNER OF

01:55:55.682 --> 01:55:58.451
THAT STRUCTURE -- BUT BEYOND

01:55:58.518 --> 01:56:00.453
THAT THERE IS THERE ISN'T A

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:02.822
MECHANISM AND THAT'S WHERE WHERE

01:56:02.889 --> 01:56:05.458
THE TEETH OF OF OUR COMPLIANCE

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:08.161
INSPECTION PROGRAM -- COME IN

01:56:08.227 --> 01:56:09.395
AND THEY COME INTO THE

01:56:09.462 --> 01:56:11.931
INDIVIDUAL LANDOWNER IN THAT

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:13.900
STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA -- AND

01:56:13.966 --> 01:56:15.868
THERE ARE AREAS AS YOU'RE WELL

01:56:15.935 --> 01:56:17.704
AWARE THAT ARE THAT ARE IN LIEU

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:20.540
LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREA

01:56:20.606 --> 01:56:22.308
THEY'RE STILL IN A VERY HIGH --

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:24.243
FIRE SEVERITY ZONE -- AND

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:26.045
THEY'RE NOT PART OF OF THE

01:56:26.112 --> 01:56:29.816
STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL IN

01:56:29.882 --> 01:56:31.150
THOSE CASES.

01:56:31.217 --> 01:56:31.784
AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.486
THIS IS GOING TO BE A A HUGE

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:35.588
ISSUE AND WE HAVE MILLIONS OF

01:56:35.655 --> 01:56:36.489
STRUCTURES AND A HAVE TO BE

01:56:36.556 --> 01:56:38.091
RETROFITTED AND MILLIONS OF

01:56:38.157 --> 01:56:39.292
LANDSCAPES.

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:40.126
THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

01:56:40.193 --> 01:56:42.362
LOOKED AT AND I THINK WE YOU

01:56:42.428 --> 01:56:44.430
HAVE A BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES

THANKS TO YOU IN YOUR EXPERTISE

POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE US WITH THE

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:01.814
WRITTEN TESTIMONY SO WE CAN --

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:03.649
ABSORB AGAIN ALL THE ACRONYMS

01:57:03.716 --> 01:57:06.085
AND AND AND FAX YOU PROVIDED TO

01:57:06.152 --> 01:57:07.487
US SO AS SOON AS WE THINK ABOUT

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:08.921
THIS FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS

01:57:08.988 --> 01:57:10.556
AND HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:57:10.623 --> 01:57:12.125
COLLEAGUES I WANNA TRY TO BREAK

01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:12.358
IT DOWN.

01:57:12.425 --> 01:57:13.860
MORE SIMPLY IF WHAT.

01:57:13.926 --> 01:57:15.461
I'LL JUST THROW OUT TO

01:57:15.528 --> 01:57:16.529
PRINCIPLES OF I THINK WHAT WE

01:57:16.596 --> 01:57:18.064
SHOULD DO WHEN IT COMES TO

01:57:18.131 --> 01:57:19.499
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:23.069
IT SEEMS THAT WE SHOULD BE -- WE

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:24.470
SHOULD BE BUILDING IN CERTAIN

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:25.638
AREAS I THINK WE ALL.

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:27.206
COULD AGREE WITH THAT AND WE

01:57:27.273 --> 01:57:28.474
SHOULD BE BUILDING MORE QUICKLY

01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:30.710
IN AREAS THAT WE CAN AGREE WE

01:57:30.777 --> 01:57:31.411
SHOULD BE BUILDING.

01:57:31.477 --> 01:57:32.545
BUT THE CHALLENGES AS MISS

01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:33.579
FREEMAN I THINK.

01:57:33.646 --> 01:57:35.481
PUT A GOOD POINT TO WE HAVEN'T

01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:36.916
REALLY BEEN DOING EITHER I LIKE

01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:39.051
TO JUST EXPLORE BOTH FOR A

01:57:39.118 --> 01:57:41.220
MOMENT -- I'VE HEARD I THINK MS

01:57:41.287 --> 01:57:42.722
GORDON TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO DE

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:44.223
PRIORITIZE DEVELOPMENTS IN HIGH

01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:45.758
RISK AREAS I HEARD THE TWO

01:57:45.825 --> 01:57:48.294
CHIEFS TALK ABOUT -- HAZARD

01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:50.229
SCORES AND THE AN ANALYSIS THAT

01:57:50.296 --> 01:57:52.265
YOU'VE DONE ON THIS BUT THE

01:57:52.331 --> 01:57:53.299
REALLY.

01:57:53.366 --> 01:57:54.400
ISN'T WE HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:56.636
AS A STATE THAT THERE ARE PARTS

01:57:56.702 --> 01:57:58.838
OF THE STATE THAT WE SHOULD

01:57:58.905 --> 01:57:59.705
CONSIDER NOT.

01:57:59.772 --> 01:58:01.407
DEVELOPING -- AND IT THIS IS A

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:03.376
VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION FOR

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:05.011
LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- BUT I THINK

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:07.647
IT MIGHT BE A ROLE FOR STATE

01:58:07.713 --> 01:58:09.282
GOVERNMENT TO HAVE THIS

01:58:09.348 --> 01:58:10.483
CONVERSATION AND I DO THINK.

01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:11.484
I'M GONNA PUT THIS DIFFICULT

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:13.853
TOPIC OUT THERE BECAUSE I'D.

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.555
I'D I'D LIKE YOUR FEEDBACK ON ON

01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:18.458
HOW WE WE DO THIS -- THERE'S NOT

01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:21.561
A SINGLE LEGISLATOR WHO WILL NOT

01:58:21.627 --> 01:58:22.094
SUPPORT THE IDEA OF LOCAL

01:58:22.161 --> 01:58:23.963
CONTROL -- BUT WE KNOW THAT

01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:25.531
THERE ARE THERE HAVE TO BE SOME

01:58:25.598 --> 01:58:27.066
NATURAL IMITATIONS TO LOCAL

01:58:27.133 --> 01:58:28.534
CONTROL AND INTERESTINGLY.

01:58:28.601 --> 01:58:29.802
WE ALL BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL

01:58:29.869 --> 01:58:31.003
WHEN IT COMES TO LAND USE

01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:32.805
DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING -- BUT

01:58:32.872 --> 01:58:34.707
WE HAVE STATEWIDE RULES AROUND

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:36.108
PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE CALIFORNIA --

01:58:36.175 --> 01:58:37.910
CRIMINAL LAW WE HAVE STATE WHAT

01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:39.345
RULES AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH

01:58:39.412 --> 01:58:41.280
AROUND PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND

01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:42.648
SAFETY OF OUR POPULATION.

01:58:42.715 --> 01:58:44.217
AND THE TOPIC WE'RE TALKING

01:58:44.283 --> 01:58:45.952
ABOUT TODAY INTERSECTS THOSE TWO

01:58:46.018 --> 01:58:47.220
THINGS AND SO.

01:58:47.286 --> 01:58:48.855
AGAIN I I GUESS I WOULD POSE THE

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:51.123
QUESTION A LITTLE MORE INTENSELY

01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:52.091
THAN MS FREEMAN TO YOU.

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:53.793
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE.

01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:54.393
PARTS OF THE STATE OR

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.162
COMMUNITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN

01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:57.763
RAVAGED BY WILDFIRES.

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:59.065
THAT WE REALLY SHOULDN'T

01:58:59.131 --> 01:59:00.867
DEVELOPMENT AND IF THAT'S THE

01:59:00.933 --> 01:59:02.335
CASE IN AT THEIR LOCAL

01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:04.003
COMMUNITIES THAT UNDERSTANDABLY

01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.670
WANT TO REBUILD WHERE THEY LIVED

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:06.873
BEFORE WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE

01:59:06.939 --> 01:59:10.109
STATE AND SAME WITH WE WE NEED

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:14.080
TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY.

01:59:14.146 --> 01:59:14.981
I KNOW IT'S A HARD QUESTION BUT

01:59:15.047 --> 01:59:16.682
THIS THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT I

01:59:16.749 --> 01:59:17.283
THINK WE NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:22.121
HERE.

01:59:22.188 --> 01:59:24.290
GO AHEAD I MEAN.

01:59:24.357 --> 01:59:25.391
YEAH I I THINK YOU'RE KIND OF

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:27.527
TOUCHING ON A LOT OF OUR AREAS

01:59:27.593 --> 01:59:31.898
AYE YOU KNOW IT IT IS -- LOOK.

01:59:31.964 --> 01:59:33.499
WE COULD BE HAVING THIS SAME

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:35.468
CONVERSATION ABOUT.

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:38.070
THE EAST BAY.

01:59:38.137 --> 01:59:40.006
HEY WOULD FALL RUNS RIGHT DOWN

01:59:40.072 --> 01:59:41.374
THE MIDDLE OF THE EAST BAY.

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:43.509
EVERY MAJOR HOSPITAL EVERY MAN

01:59:43.576 --> 01:59:45.711
THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ACCEPT

01:59:45.778 --> 01:59:48.014
ALL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE ON

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:50.283
THE EARTHQUAKE FAULT.

01:59:50.349 --> 01:59:51.350
THAT'S A BAD THING IT'S GOING TO

01:59:51.417 --> 01:59:52.618
HAPPEN IT'S A GOOD COULD PRODUCE

01:59:52.685 --> 01:59:53.386
OF A SEVEN POINT EIGHT

01:59:53.452 --> 01:59:56.088
EARTHQUAKE YET WE BUILD AND LIVE.

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:58.090
ON THIS FALL.

01:59:58.157 --> 02:00:00.159
OKAY THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:02.061
MANY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:00:02.128 --> 02:00:02.895
SO.

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:04.263
KNOWING THAT WE'VE GOT SOME

02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:06.499
LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF RISK OF

02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:07.934
SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF RISK

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.368
THE NEXT STEP IS.

02:00:09.435 --> 02:00:11.137
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU BUILD YOU

02:00:11.203 --> 02:00:13.906
BUILD? TO MAKE MORE RESILIENCY

02:00:13.973 --> 02:00:15.007
YOU INCREASED.

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:16.309
BUILDING CODES.

02:00:16.375 --> 02:00:18.010
YOU YOU YOU MAKE MORE RESILIENT

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:19.545
STRUCTURES IN THE CASE OF

02:00:19.612 --> 02:00:20.947
EARTHQUAKE THAT'S RETROFITTING

02:00:21.013 --> 02:00:22.248
ITS BUILDING TO HIRE BUILDING

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:23.382
CODES.

02:00:23.449 --> 02:00:25.117
IN THE CASE A WHILE I FIRE TO

02:00:25.184 --> 02:00:26.886
CHIEF REPRISE POINT IT'S IT'S

02:00:26.953 --> 02:00:28.654
IT'S LOOKING OUT OUR EXISTING

02:00:28.721 --> 02:00:29.355
CODES.

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:32.224
AND INCREASING THE COACH TO TRY

02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:33.559
TO MAKE.

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:34.827
HOMES THAT ARE GOING TO BE BUILT

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:37.096
IN THE WE WE MORE RESILIENT BUT

02:00:37.163 --> 02:00:39.165
IT'S ALSO LOOKING AT THE FIRE

02:00:39.231 --> 02:00:41.000
CORRIDOR AREA AND DETERMINE YOU

02:00:41.067 --> 02:00:43.569
MAYBE NOT EVERY PART OF THAT

02:00:43.636 --> 02:00:44.670
COMMUNITY.

02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:46.439
IS BUILDABLE MAYBE SOME OF IT

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:47.974
HAS TO HAVE GREEN SPACE IN IT TO

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:50.309
BUILD THESE FIRE BUFFERS THE QUE

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:51.010
TALKED ABOUT.

02:00:51.077 --> 02:00:54.580
SO SO SO THAT SO THAT THERE'S

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:56.882
THE ABILITY -- TO SLOWER

02:00:56.949 --> 02:00:58.351
DEFERRED FIRE SHOULD HAPPEN

02:00:58.417 --> 02:01:01.120
RIGHT THAT HAS TO BE BUILT INTO

02:01:01.187 --> 02:01:02.288
ALSO.

02:01:02.355 --> 02:01:03.556
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT A

02:01:03.623 --> 02:01:05.324
DEFENSIBLE SPACE PLANNING.

02:01:05.391 --> 02:01:07.526
SO IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE CHIEF'S

02:01:07.593 --> 02:01:08.160
QUARTERS.

02:01:08.227 --> 02:01:09.996
POINT NOT A SILVER BULLET IT'S A

02:01:10.062 --> 02:01:13.065
COMPENDIUM OF OF EFFORTS -- BUT

02:01:13.132 --> 02:01:14.800
WE NEED TO GET OVER THAT HURDLE

02:01:14.867 --> 02:01:16.068
FIRST.

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:17.770
BIT THAT SAYS.

02:01:17.837 --> 02:01:18.671
BOOK.

02:01:18.738 --> 02:01:20.339
I JUST THINK THE TAX BASE AND I

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:21.340
NEED TO BUILD.

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:25.778
AND YOUR REGARDLESS OF THOSE

02:01:25.845 --> 02:01:27.313
RISKS.

02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:28.247
WAR.

02:01:28.314 --> 02:01:28.848
WE'RE GONNA PROVE DEVELOPMENT

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:29.749
AND WE'LL WORRY ABOUT THE RISK

02:01:29.815 --> 02:01:29.982
LATER.

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:31.651
OR TEN INSURANCE PROBLEM OR THE

02:01:31.717 --> 02:01:33.152
FEDERAL OR STATE GOVERNMENT WILL

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:34.487
COME IN THE DISASTER RECOVERY.

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:35.655
WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO IS

02:01:35.721 --> 02:01:37.556
TAKE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF SAFETY

02:01:37.623 --> 02:01:39.792
AND SECURITY AND PUT IT ON THE

02:01:39.859 --> 02:01:41.293
FRONT END OF OUR?

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:43.496
GENERAL PLANNING FOR COMMUNITY

02:01:43.562 --> 02:01:45.631
AND BASED UPON THAT ASSESSMENT

02:01:45.698 --> 02:01:47.767
THEN BUILD YOUR MOVE FORWARD

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:49.301
WITH YOUR WITH YOUR BILL THAT

02:01:49.368 --> 02:01:54.006
MATCHES MY POINT CAN'T BE THAT.

02:01:54.073 --> 02:01:55.274
HARD.

02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:56.876
YEAH A AGAIN TOM BORDER -- CAL

02:01:56.942 --> 02:01:58.778
FIRE I I I I I AGREE WITH --

02:01:58.844 --> 02:01:59.512
DIRECTOR GIL DO CHEESE --

02:01:59.578 --> 02:02:01.947
COMMENTS A IT REALLY IS --

02:02:02.014 --> 02:02:04.650
CALIFORNIA AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING --

02:02:04.717 --> 02:02:06.752
ALL AFTERNOON IS A DISASTER

02:02:06.819 --> 02:02:08.988
PRONE -- LANDSCAPE IN THERE ARE

02:02:09.055 --> 02:02:11.557
VERY FEW AREAS OF THE STATE THAT

02:02:11.624 --> 02:02:14.360
YOU COULD SAY ARE TRULY NOT.

02:02:14.427 --> 02:02:18.197
IN PERIL BY SOME NATURAL OR

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:19.632
HUMAN CAUSED DISASTERS.

02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:23.035
AND SO -- WELL THAT -- KIND OF

02:02:23.102 --> 02:02:25.504
FIT IS A BIT OF A DEFEATIST --

02:02:25.571 --> 02:02:28.107
STATEMENT -- WE DO NEED TO DO

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:30.309
WHAT WE CAN TO BUY DOWN THE RISK

02:02:30.376 --> 02:02:34.046
AND SO -- WELL WE DO HAVE TWO

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:36.248
MILLION PLUS -- HOMES IN VERY

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:40.352
HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONE MAP

02:02:40.419 --> 02:02:43.189
AREAS ALREADY -- AND THERE ARE

02:02:43.255 --> 02:02:45.925
LOCAL A LAND USE PLANS THAT HAVE

02:02:45.991 --> 02:02:47.693
PLANS TO DEVELOP MORE IN THOSE

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:50.663
SAME AREAS -- PART OF THE

02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:53.933
EQUATION HERE IS REALLY THAT.

02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:55.067
ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH AND

02:02:55.134 --> 02:02:57.903
BUYING DOWN THE RISK BY DOING

02:02:57.970 --> 02:02:59.205
FUELS MANAGEMENT THAT IS.

02:02:59.271 --> 02:03:01.974
DISTANT TWO ADJACENT TO AND

02:03:02.041 --> 02:03:03.743
WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:05.745
AS HARDENING THE STRUCTURES OR

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:07.546
ENSURING THAT FUTURE STRUCTURES

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:09.281
ARE HARDENED TO THE POINT WHERE.

02:03:09.348 --> 02:03:12.752
THEY CAN -- THE COMMUNITY CAN BE

02:03:12.818 --> 02:03:14.954
RESILIENT THROUGH THE NEXT FIRE

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:16.555
THAT COMES WHEN TALKING ABOUT

02:03:16.622 --> 02:03:19.358
FIRES OF COURSE WE HAVE --

02:03:19.425 --> 02:03:21.927
MULTIPLE TYPES OF OF RISKS THAT

02:03:21.994 --> 02:03:23.696
ARE KIND OF OVERLAPPING WHETHER

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:25.131
IT'S EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE

02:03:25.197 --> 02:03:27.700
EARTHQUAKE FIRE FLOOD -- SETO

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:29.969
WAS A WAS A COMMUNITY THAT WAS

02:03:30.035 --> 02:03:33.139
REALLY HIT HARD BY FLOODS THAT.

02:03:33.205 --> 02:03:34.340
THAT WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE SEEN

02:03:34.406 --> 02:03:36.175
COMING BUT THEY ALSO WERE MUCH

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:38.477
MORE EXTREME THAN WE EXPECTED

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:39.845
EVER TO SEE.

02:03:39.912 --> 02:03:41.647
SO IT ALL OF THESE THINGS I I

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:44.350
BELIEVE -- MEMBER CHIU THIS IS

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:46.118
THIS IS AYE AYE AYE UP APPLAUD

02:03:46.185 --> 02:03:48.754
THIS DIFFICULT DECISION A

02:03:48.821 --> 02:03:50.422
DECISION COVER CONVERSATION THAT

02:03:50.489 --> 02:03:53.993
WE'RE HAVING BUT IT REALLY IS.

02:03:54.059 --> 02:03:55.194
THERE THERE'S WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

02:03:55.261 --> 02:03:56.996
IT FROM A VERY HOLISTIC APPROACH.

02:03:57.062 --> 02:03:59.298
JUST BRIEFLY TO ADD TO BOTH MY

02:03:59.365 --> 02:04:00.432
COLLEAGUES VERY GOOD COMMENTS ON

02:04:00.499 --> 02:04:03.469
THIS I I WOULD SAY THAT -- ONE

02:04:03.536 --> 02:04:04.970
OF THE CLASSIC TENSIONS THAT WE

02:04:05.037 --> 02:04:06.939
HAVE WHICH YOU BOTH REFER TO IS

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.040
THIS SORT OF ECONOMIC TENSION

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:10.042
PEOPLE WANT TO BUILD IN ORDER TO

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:11.644
GET THEY THEY THE TAX BASE.

02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:13.078
BOB AND IT'S HARD TO LOOK OUT

02:04:13.145 --> 02:04:13.979
FOR IF YOU'RE AN ELECTED

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:15.548
OFFICIAL ESPECIALLY WHO IS ON A

02:04:15.614 --> 02:04:17.516
SHORTER TIME HORIZON. ONE THING

02:04:17.583 --> 02:04:18.984
THAT I DO THINK THOUGH IS REALLY

02:04:19.051 --> 02:04:20.753
BECOMING MORE CLEAR AND

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.621
UNFORTUNATELY THIS PAST FEW

02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:24.089
MONTHS HAVE MADE IT MORE CLEAR.

02:04:24.156 --> 02:04:26.292
IS THAT CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE NOT

02:04:26.358 --> 02:04:28.427
A FAR OFF THING ANYMORE THE AND

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:30.029
THAT NOT ONLY THAT.

02:04:30.095 --> 02:04:31.564
BUT THEY ARE HAVING A DIRECT

02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:32.998
IMPACT ON THE ECONOMICS OF THESE

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:35.701
DECISIONS SO THE FACT THAT OUR

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:37.937
MAJOR UTILITIES WERE DOWNGRADED.

02:04:38.003 --> 02:04:39.238
RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED IN PART

02:04:39.305 --> 02:04:41.807
BECAUSE OF AN ABILITY TO REACT

02:04:41.874 --> 02:04:43.275
TO SOME OF THE INCREASED FIRE

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:44.176
RISK IN STATE.

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:46.445
IS AN IMPORTANT TOUCHSTONE

02:04:46.512 --> 02:04:48.080
BECAUSE IT IT IT IT IS AN

02:04:48.147 --> 02:04:49.782
EXAMPLE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE OF

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:51.617
RAIDER BOND RATERS INSURERS

02:04:51.684 --> 02:04:53.886
ISSUERS STARTING TO ACTUALLY

02:04:53.953 --> 02:04:54.854
INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE RISKS

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:56.155
INTO THEIR DECISION MAKING IN

02:04:56.222 --> 02:04:57.556
AND FINANCES.

02:04:57.623 --> 02:04:59.058
WE ARE A FEW YEARS AGO STATE

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:00.593
FARM ACTUALLY SUED THE CITY OF

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:01.660
CHICAGO FOR NOT BEING

02:05:01.727 --> 02:05:03.662
APPROPRIATELY RESPONSIVE TO

02:05:03.729 --> 02:05:04.897
CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND IT'S

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:06.131
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING.

02:05:06.198 --> 02:05:08.133
MANY PEOPLE EXPECT MORE OF THOSE

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.802
TYPES OF LAWSUITS GOING FORWARD

02:05:09.869 --> 02:05:11.737
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:12.538
AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

02:05:12.605 --> 02:05:13.038
THAT.

02:05:13.105 --> 02:05:14.440
CLIMATE RISKS ARE DIFFERENT THAN

02:05:14.506 --> 02:05:18.944
EARTHQUAKES IN THAT THEY ARE

02:05:19.011 --> 02:05:20.145
MUCH MORE PREDICTABLE.

02:05:20.212 --> 02:05:21.714
SO THE THE WORLD OF INVESTORS

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:23.015
LONG TERM INVESTORS IS ACTUALLY

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:24.350
STARTING TO PAY ATTENTION TO

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:25.484
THAT PREDICT RISK.

02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:27.887
I THINK WE WILL SEE MORE

02:05:27.953 --> 02:05:29.755
ECONOMIC IMPACTS FROM THOSE

02:05:29.822 --> 02:05:32.157
PREDICTIONS IN THESE PROJECTS

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:33.659
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER TO YOUR

02:05:33.726 --> 02:05:34.226
QUESTION OF WHAT THE STATE

02:05:34.293 --> 02:05:35.094
SHOULD BE DOING.

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:37.162
BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT

02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:38.530
ABOUT I THINK WHERE SOME OF

02:05:38.597 --> 02:05:39.698
THESE DECISIONS ARE GONNA START

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:40.900
BEING MADE POTENTIALLY AT THE

02:05:40.966 --> 02:05:42.835
LOCAL LEVEL WE DO FEEL LIKE OUR

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:44.670
ROLE AT THE STATE IS TO MAKE

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:46.105
THOSE DATA AS AVAILABLE AS

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:46.772
POSSIBLE.

02:05:46.839 --> 02:05:48.173
SO THAT WHEN COMMUNITIES ARE

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.276
LOOKING AT THE PREDICTIVE REST

02:05:50.342 --> 02:05:50.943
WE CAN GIVE THEM AS MUCH

02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:52.478
INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE TO BE

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:53.412
ABLE TO SAY.

02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:55.414
THIS IS WHERE WE SEE A HUNDRED

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:56.482
YEAR FLOOD BECOMING A TEN YEAR

02:05:56.548 --> 02:05:57.816
FLOOD THIS IS WHERE WE SEE

02:05:57.883 --> 02:05:59.985
SEVERITY AND AND AND FREQUENCY

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:00.886
INCREASING.

02:06:00.953 --> 02:06:02.554
AT SORT OF STAGGERING RATES THIS

02:06:02.621 --> 02:06:03.923
IS WHERE WE SEE THE IMPACTS

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.891
HITTING SOONER AND THEN LATER WE

02:06:05.958 --> 02:06:07.192
DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY WE

02:06:07.259 --> 02:06:11.163
THINK TO PROVIDE THAT.

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:11.764
BECAUSE THAT FEEDS INTO THESE

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:12.464
DECISIONS.

02:06:12.531 --> 02:06:13.632
APPRECIATE THAT.

02:06:13.699 --> 02:06:14.133
I HAD A NUMBER OF OTHER

02:06:14.199 --> 02:06:15.234
QUESTIONS BUT IN RESPECT TO

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:16.869
OTHER COLLEAGUES LET ME JUST

02:06:16.936 --> 02:06:19.071
MAKE TWO COMMENTS SO ON THE ONE

02:06:19.138 --> 02:06:21.573
HAND -- IT IT'S MY PERSPECTIVE

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:22.741
WE'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:23.375
WE DON'T BUILD BUT ON THE FLIP

02:06:23.442 --> 02:06:24.376
SIDE.

02:06:24.443 --> 02:06:25.711
OF WE ARE CLEARLY NOT DOING A

02:06:25.778 --> 02:06:27.212
GOOD JOB OF BUILDING WHERE THERE

02:06:27.279 --> 02:06:28.948
IS LESS RISK -- TO CHECK POOREST

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:30.282
POINT ASSUMING EVERY AREA HAS

02:06:30.349 --> 02:06:32.151
SOME REST I THINK WE CAN ALL

02:06:32.217 --> 02:06:32.751
AGREE THERE ARE PARTS OF THE

02:06:32.818 --> 02:06:34.320
STATE MANY PARTS OF THE STATE

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:35.988
THAT ARE LESS RISKY FOR US TO DO

02:06:36.055 --> 02:06:37.222
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE

02:06:37.289 --> 02:06:38.557
BEEN THINKING ABOUT AS I'M.

02:06:38.624 --> 02:06:39.825
LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONIES YOU

02:06:39.892 --> 02:06:41.794
LATER ON ALL OF THE DIFFERENT

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.963
ANALYSES AND HAZARD MITIGATION

02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:46.966
FEES AND SEQUEL AND AND IT ADDS

02:06:47.032 --> 02:06:47.967
TIME.

02:06:48.033 --> 02:06:49.935
AND AND MONEY TO ACTUALLY

02:06:50.002 --> 02:06:52.004
BUILDING HOUSING SO SO I THINK

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:53.706
THE IRONY HERE IS -- THERE'S A

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:55.507
NATURAL DESIRES FOR COMMUNITIES

02:06:55.574 --> 02:06:56.809
THAT HAVE BEEN RAVAGED AND

02:06:56.875 --> 02:06:58.577
DESTROYED TO REBUILD THEMSELVES

02:06:58.644 --> 02:07:00.045
AND THEIR ISSUES WITH THAT.

02:07:00.112 --> 02:07:02.281
AND THEN BECAUSE OF THE CLIMATE

02:07:02.348 --> 02:07:03.682
CHANGE IN THE CHALLENGES WERE

02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:04.416
LAYERING ON AND ACTUALLY

02:07:04.483 --> 02:07:05.617
POTENTIALLY MAKING IT SLOWER TO

02:07:05.684 --> 02:07:07.219
BUILD WHERE WE SHOULD.

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:09.488
AND THAT'S JUST A COMMENT AND

02:07:09.555 --> 02:07:10.889
AND I WOULD SAY COLLEAGUES I

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:11.724
HOPE WE CAN ENGAGE IN THIS AND

02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:13.726
THINK OF WHAT CAN WE DO TO SPEED

02:07:13.792 --> 02:07:15.761
UP PRODUCTION WE ARE IT IS LESS

02:07:15.828 --> 02:07:16.595
RISK IN THE LAST THING I WANT TO

02:07:16.662 --> 02:07:17.663
JUST.

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:19.531
ASK FOR SUGGEST IS I KNOW

02:07:19.598 --> 02:07:20.733
GOVERNOR NEWSOME HIS PROPOSED.

02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:22.568
NEW PLENTY DOLLARS THIS YEAR UP

02:07:22.634 --> 02:07:24.003
WHEN IT COMES TO THINK ABOUT

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:25.070
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BUT IT'S

02:07:25.137 --> 02:07:26.638
OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS PLANE

02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:28.474
DOLLARS ARE REALLY FOCUSED AS

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:28.974
MUCH AS THEY COULD BE ON

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:30.275
COMMUNITIES.

02:07:30.342 --> 02:07:30.843
LIKE THE ONES WE'RE TALKING

02:07:30.909 --> 02:07:32.578
ABOUT TODAY THAT REALLY NEED TO

02:07:32.644 --> 02:07:34.413
DO AN AWFUL LOT OF PLANNING TO

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.015
FIGURE THIS OUT AND AND I WOULD

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:38.250
SUPPORT THINKING ABOUT HOW WE

02:07:38.317 --> 02:07:38.951
CAN HELP.

02:07:39.018 --> 02:07:40.352
THOSE COMMUNITIES DO THIS

02:07:40.419 --> 02:07:41.653
PLANNING FASTER SO THEY CAN TAKE

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:42.988
THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE AND TAKE

02:07:43.055 --> 02:07:45.824
THE BEST THINKING THAT WE GOT IN

02:07:45.891 --> 02:07:46.458
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO EITHER

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:47.059
REBUILD OR NOT.

02:07:47.126 --> 02:07:48.160
AND THEN TO MAKE SURE OTHER

02:07:48.227 --> 02:07:49.294
COMMUNITIES ARE BUILDING EVEN

02:07:49.361 --> 02:07:51.063
FASTER TO DEAL WITH THE THE THE

02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:53.065
THE THE THE STRIKE THAT THE

02:07:53.132 --> 02:07:53.632
CRISIS.

02:07:53.699 --> 02:07:54.833
AND STRESS SO.

02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:55.768
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

02:07:55.834 --> 02:07:57.002
CONVERSATION TO LOOK FOR TO

02:07:57.069 --> 02:08:04.243
OTHERS -- WITH -- WITH HER

02:08:04.309 --> 02:08:06.745
COLLEAGUES THANK YOU.

02:08:06.812 --> 02:08:09.114
THANK YOU US A MEMORABLE FELL.

02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:09.782
MADAM CHAIR IN MY COLLEAGUES --

02:08:09.848 --> 02:08:10.983
I HAVE DEFINITION QUESTION AND

02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:11.483
DIRECTION HERE POSSIBLE

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:12.451
DIRECTION THAT THIS COMMITTEE

02:08:12.518 --> 02:08:13.886
AND THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE MAY

02:08:13.952 --> 02:08:15.921
POSSIBLY TAKE.

02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:18.891
SO FOR DEFINITION -- JUST TO

02:08:18.957 --> 02:08:19.992
MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:23.228
PAGE -- TAKE JUST A FEW SECONDS.

02:08:23.295 --> 02:08:24.530
INSURANCE SERVICE.

02:08:24.596 --> 02:08:26.265
OFFICE.

02:08:26.331 --> 02:08:28.233
STARTED SEVENTY YEARS AGO

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.035
BASICALLY AS AN INSURANCE

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:32.871
PAPERWORK FACTORY OKAY.

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:35.007
NOW THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.842
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES THE

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:40.145
I. S. O. INSURED SERVICE OFFICE.

02:08:40.212 --> 02:08:42.915
DOES FIRE -- ASSESSMENT

02:08:42.981 --> 02:08:44.416
DISTRICTS.

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:47.152
SO THE FIRE ASSESSMENT DISTRICT

02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:50.189
FOR INSURANCE PREMIUM PURPOSES

02:08:50.255 --> 02:08:51.790
GOES FROM.

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:55.260
AYE SO ONE THROUGH I. S. O.

02:08:55.327 --> 02:08:55.561
[inaudible]

02:08:55.627 --> 02:08:58.397
TEN NOW -- WITH THAT ESTABLISHED

02:08:58.464 --> 02:09:00.699
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK CAL FIRE.

02:09:00.766 --> 02:09:05.237
HOW MANY I SO NINE AND I. S. O.?

02:09:05.304 --> 02:09:07.039
TEN DISTRICTS ARE THERE IN

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:12.277
CALIFORNIA.

02:09:12.344 --> 02:09:13.679
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER I WOULD

02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:15.948
SPECULATE THAT MANY OF THE RURAL

02:09:16.014 --> 02:09:17.416
VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENTS.

02:09:17.483 --> 02:09:19.184
ARE PROBABLY IN THOSE CATEGORIES

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:20.786
IN THE CLASS ONES ARE PROBABLY

02:09:20.853 --> 02:09:21.553
MORE THAN LARGER METRO

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.755
DEPARTMENTS OKAY NOW THESE ARE

02:09:23.822 --> 02:09:25.491
FRIENDLY QUESTIONS OKAY.

02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:27.359
I'M.

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:28.961
I'M NOT GOING DOWN THE PLACE

02:09:29.027 --> 02:09:30.062
YOU'RE NOT GONNA OF LIKE TO GO

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:31.930
TO RIGHT.

02:09:31.997 --> 02:09:34.466
SO THE REASON I SET THAT UP FOR

02:09:34.533 --> 02:09:38.036
I SO NINE AND I ALSO TEN IS.

02:09:38.103 --> 02:09:42.307
I ALSO TEN AND NINE IS VERY HIGH

02:09:42.374 --> 02:09:44.409
INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND MANY

02:09:44.476 --> 02:09:47.012
TIMES THE HOMEOWNERS IN THOSE

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:49.781
AREAS THAT WE REALLY DON'T WANT

02:09:49.848 --> 02:09:50.349
THEM TO BUILD AND BUT THERE

02:09:50.415 --> 02:09:51.783
THERE.

02:09:51.850 --> 02:09:55.020
OKAY MANY TIMES THEY DO NOT BUY

02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:56.922
INSURANCE BECAUSE EITHER IT'S

02:09:56.989 --> 02:09:59.491
NOT OFFERED ON THE COMMERCIAL

02:09:59.558 --> 02:10:03.095
INSURANCE MARKETS. FOR THE

02:10:03.162 --> 02:10:06.165
CALIFORNIA HAS THE FAIR PLAN.

02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:07.432
WHICH MEANS IF YOU CAN'T GET

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:09.134
INSURANCE YOU BUY IT FROM THE

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:10.369
FAIR PLAN.

02:10:10.435 --> 02:10:13.038
WELL THE FAIR PLAN HOUSE DID NOT

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:15.207
GO BROKE SO THOSE PREMIUMS ARE

02:10:15.274 --> 02:10:16.875
VERY HIGH.

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:17.843
NOW.

02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:20.479
WHERE THAT BREEZES IS?

02:10:20.546 --> 02:10:22.915
YOU ALL HAVE A DATABASE.

02:10:22.981 --> 02:10:25.350
YOU KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN AYE SO

02:10:25.417 --> 02:10:27.619
AREAS OF DEVASTATING FIRES GOING

02:10:27.686 --> 02:10:29.655
TO BLOW THROUGH THERE EVERY

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:30.722
TWENTY TWO YEARS I'M JUST MAKING

02:10:30.789 --> 02:10:32.658
THAT UP FOR ILLUSTRATION.

02:10:32.724 --> 02:10:36.028
BUT YOU KNOW I SO KNOWS SO THIS

02:10:36.094 --> 02:10:39.231
COMMITTEE NEEDS TO GET.

02:10:39.298 --> 02:10:40.799
THE I SO.

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:41.900
IS FOR NINE AND TEN WE NEED TO

02:10:41.967 --> 02:10:44.903
GET THE DATABASE FOR YOU ALL.

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:46.972
COMPARE OKAY HERE'S WHERE I'M

02:10:47.039 --> 02:10:48.574
GOING WITH THIS AND YOU'LL LIKE

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.342
WHERE I'M GOING TO WRITE

02:10:50.409 --> 02:10:50.642
[inaudible]

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:53.612
SO.

02:10:53.679 --> 02:10:57.082
ACCORDING -- TO ONE OF MY BILLS

02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:58.784
YOU CANNOT PRECLUDE AND CAN

02:10:58.850 --> 02:11:01.220
COOLEY WILL.

02:11:01.286 --> 02:11:02.955
EITHER CONFIRM IZZARD DENY IT

02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:05.624
BECAUSE HE IS OF SMART ATTORNEY.

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:07.092
YOU CANNOT PRECLUDE ANYONE FROM

02:11:07.159 --> 02:11:09.094
SUING.

02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:11.029
SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE

02:11:11.096 --> 02:11:14.766
THAT'S MACRO IN CALIFORNIA IS.

02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:16.668
THESE FIRES BLOW THROUGH AND NOW

02:11:16.735 --> 02:11:19.004
EVERYONE SUES PGN THE S. D. G.

02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:22.608
IN THE EDISON WHATEVER. FOR A

02:11:22.674 --> 02:11:24.543
GAZILLION DOLLARS AND I JUST

02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:27.879
MADE THAT NUMBER UP -- WHICH

02:11:27.946 --> 02:11:30.916
MEANS THAT BY DEFAULT THE

02:11:30.983 --> 02:11:32.884
ELECTRIC COMPANIES OR WHOEVER

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:34.853
ELSE CAN BE A DEEP POCKET IS THE

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:37.422
INSURER FOR PEOPLE THAT REFUSE

02:11:37.489 --> 02:11:38.357
TO GET THE INSURANCE.

02:11:38.423 --> 02:11:42.461
SO. ONE OF MY POSSIBLE

02:11:42.527 --> 02:11:43.695
DIRECTIONS TO GO IN.

02:11:43.762 --> 02:11:44.830
IS.

02:11:44.896 --> 02:11:46.465
YOU CANNOT PRECLUDE ANYONE FROM

02:11:46.531 --> 02:11:47.599
SUING.

02:11:47.666 --> 02:11:49.568
BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS PRESIDENT

02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:51.436
SO WE NEED TO RESEARCH THIS IS A

02:11:51.503 --> 02:11:54.606
COMMITTEE. TO LIMIT HOW MUCH YOU

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:58.810
CONSUME FAR IN I SO NINE AND ISO.

02:11:58.877 --> 02:12:01.213
TEN THAT COULD BE A POSSIBLE WAY

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:08.253
OF GOING -- BUT WE NEED TO KNOW

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:11.690
WHERE THOSE DISTRICTS ARE.

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:14.192
AND THE I SO PEOPLE WON'T.

02:12:14.259 --> 02:12:16.395
RELEASE IT LETS YOU PAY MONEY OR

02:12:16.461 --> 02:12:17.763
YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT BODY.

02:12:17.829 --> 02:12:19.498
NOW I DID NOT TRY TO GET THAT

02:12:19.564 --> 02:12:21.400
INFORMATION BECAUSE I WANTED TO

02:12:21.466 --> 02:12:24.503
DEFER. TO THIS COMMITTEE AND THE

02:12:24.569 --> 02:12:25.937
INSURANCE COMMITTEE.

02:12:26.004 --> 02:12:29.574
SO THAT IS A POSSIBLE WAY OF

02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:32.277
GOING. TO MITIGATE.

02:12:32.344 --> 02:12:35.180
YOUR PROBLEMS AND THE MACRO

02:12:35.247 --> 02:12:36.848
PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY.

02:12:36.915 --> 02:12:39.384
FOR THE ELECTRIC COMPANIES.

02:12:39.451 --> 02:12:39.551
NOW.

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:40.619
IF.

02:12:40.686 --> 02:12:42.287
YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH MONEY

02:12:42.354 --> 02:12:44.356
YOU'LL GET PAID FOR A LAWSUIT

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:46.892
pWHEN YOU BUILD YOUR GIANT CABIN

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:48.460
UP IN THE MOUNTAINS.

02:12:48.527 --> 02:12:51.063
AND MAYBE GROW SOME TO YOU KNOW

02:12:51.129 --> 02:12:53.865
I DON'T KNOW -- YOU'LL THINK

02:12:53.932 --> 02:12:55.267
TWICE ABOUT BUILDING THE OR

02:12:55.334 --> 02:12:56.868
DOING WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING UP

02:12:56.935 --> 02:12:59.204
IN THE MOUNTAINS ESPECIALLY.

02:12:59.271 --> 02:13:01.406
IF WE ALSO WITHIN A POSSIBLE

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:04.409
BILL IN THE FUTURE PUT IN THAT

02:13:04.476 --> 02:13:07.012
YOU HAVE THAT WHOEVER IS SELLING

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:08.914
THAT PROPERTY HAS TO DO A FULL

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:10.215
DISCLOSURE.

02:13:10.282 --> 02:13:12.984
ON THE FIRE RISK IN HOW MANY HOW

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:15.153
OFTEN THE FIRE BLOWS THROUGH

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:15.887
THERE.

02:13:15.954 --> 02:13:18.190
SO YOU CAN DO SOME INTERESTING

02:13:18.256 --> 02:13:20.559
NEAT THINGS FROM AN INSURANCE

02:13:20.625 --> 02:13:21.660
VIEWPOINT.

02:13:21.727 --> 02:13:23.028
AND THAT'S MY COMMENTS.

02:13:23.095 --> 02:13:26.531
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY

02:13:26.598 --> 02:13:27.099

KIND OF FOLLOW UP AND TRY TO DIG

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:32.571
JUST A LITTLE BIT DEEPER AND

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:34.639
WHAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES UPSET --

02:13:34.706 --> 02:13:36.541
YOU MENTION MONEY CO I REPRESENT

02:13:36.608 --> 02:13:38.577
WANT TO CO AND CERTAINLY AND

02:13:38.643 --> 02:13:40.512
THAT'S BEEN HARD AND A LOT OF

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:41.747
EXAMPLES HAVE BEEN GIVEN OF

02:13:41.813 --> 02:13:42.848
THINGS I THINK THAT BEEN TURNED

02:13:42.914 --> 02:13:43.915
SANTA BARBARA COUNTY HAVE

02:13:43.982 --> 02:13:45.250
EXPERIENCE INCLUDING THE AD

02:13:45.317 --> 02:13:47.452
BUFFER -- FOR THE CITY OF SANTA

02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:49.254
PAULA AND YOU KNOW THINKING

02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:50.389
ABOUT WANT TO SEE YOU AS AN

02:13:50.455 --> 02:13:52.257
EXAMPLE AS IT RELATES TO

02:13:52.324 --> 02:13:53.925
BUILDING HOUSING WE KNOW SYMBOL

02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:56.261
I KNOW SO MUCH MORE ABOUT A

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:57.829
ALLUVIAL FANS NOW.

02:13:57.896 --> 02:13:59.931
THAN I DID BEFORE BUT I ALSO

02:13:59.998 --> 02:14:04.035
WITHIN READ THAT OTHER

02:14:04.102 --> 02:14:05.170
COMMUNITIES ARE BUILDING.

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:06.238
ON THE SAME ALLUVIAL FANS THAT

02:14:06.304 --> 02:14:07.272
BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:08.039
DIDN'T WANT TO SEE.

02:14:08.106 --> 02:14:09.741
AND SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

02:14:09.808 --> 02:14:10.509
WHERE.

02:14:10.575 --> 02:14:11.877
IN ANY THINK MY COLLEAGUES WRITE

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:13.979
WERE TRYING TO GET AT THIS TOO

02:14:14.045 --> 02:14:15.714
BUT WHERE'S THE NEXUS BETWEEN

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:17.983
WHAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY AND THE

02:14:18.049 --> 02:14:19.484
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE THOUGHTS

02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:20.419
AND THE FEEDBACK YOU'VE SHARED

02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:22.854
WITH US WITH HOW IT BECOMES.

02:14:22.921 --> 02:14:25.257
REAL IN COMMUNITIES IN MODESTY

02:14:25.323 --> 02:14:27.859
DO THERE WERE AREAS THAT THE

02:14:27.926 --> 02:14:29.995
COUNTY BOUGHT OUT -- BECAUSE

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:31.096
THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS THAT

02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:32.464
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:34.499
REBUILD BUT I MEAN I READ IN

02:14:34.566 --> 02:14:36.134
PAPERS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES IN

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:37.269
THE STATE THAT ARE THINKING

02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:38.970
ABOUT BUILDING MAJOR HOUSING

02:14:39.037 --> 02:14:40.505
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SAME AREA.

02:14:40.572 --> 02:14:43.408
WE HAVE -- IN NEED -- ADDED

02:14:43.475 --> 02:14:46.311
DESIRE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING IN

02:14:46.378 --> 02:14:48.680
THIS STATE BUT I MEAN WHERE IS

02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:50.148
THE NEXUS BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE

02:14:50.215 --> 02:14:52.417
HEARING TODAY AND WHAT IS REALLY

02:14:52.484 --> 02:14:53.952
HAPPENING IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES

02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:56.688
RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HOUSING --

02:14:56.755 --> 02:14:58.356
I THINK IT'S PLAYED ITSELF OUT

02:14:58.423 --> 02:15:00.425
IN A VERY COMPARABLE COMPLICATED

02:15:00.492 --> 02:15:00.992
WAY IN THE DISTRICT THAT I

02:15:01.059 --> 02:15:03.395
REPRESENT -- AND I KNOW WE WILL

02:15:03.462 --> 02:15:05.063
HAVE ANOTHER NATURAL DISASTER --

02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:06.598
INVENTOR IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY

02:15:06.665 --> 02:15:08.934
WE'VE HAD -- REGRETTABLY MANY

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.936
BUT I MEAN WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH

02:15:11.002 --> 02:15:12.537
THIS HOUSING SITUATION AWAY WE

02:15:12.604 --> 02:15:15.307
HADN'T -- IN ADDITION TO WE HAVE

02:15:15.373 --> 02:15:17.442
THE HIGH FIRE AREAS -- AND THEN

02:15:17.509 --> 02:15:19.611
WE HAVE A ONE A ONE AND THAT

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:22.080
BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- IS

02:15:22.147 --> 02:15:24.149
ERODING SO I'M THINKING

02:15:24.216 --> 02:15:25.717
EVACUATION PLANS I MEAN THIS IS

02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:27.886
I'M LIKE HOW. ONE NIGHT I HAD A

02:15:27.953 --> 02:15:28.520
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN MY

02:15:28.587 --> 02:15:29.888
DISTRICT EVACUATED SO I'M

02:15:29.955 --> 02:15:33.859
THINKING HOW DOES THIS ALL COME

02:15:33.925 --> 02:15:34.359
TO ONE TO MAKE THE BEST

02:15:34.426 --> 02:15:36.361
DECISIONS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE

02:15:36.428 --> 02:15:41.900
POLICIES WERE ALSO SEEN.

02:15:41.967 --> 02:15:43.702
ARE REALLY -- I DON'T THINK THEY

02:15:43.768 --> 02:15:44.336
DIG DEEP IN THIS AREA AND I AND

02:15:44.402 --> 02:15:45.403
I FIND MYSELF STRUGGLING WHAT DO

02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:46.805
WE REQUIRE.

02:15:46.872 --> 02:15:50.942
CITIES COUNTIES -- TO DO THAT

02:15:51.009 --> 02:15:52.911
CHANGES THE WAY OUR LOCAL COULD

02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:54.312
THE TOOLS THAT OUR LOCAL

02:15:54.379 --> 02:15:56.281
COMMUNITIES HAVE AND USED TO

02:15:56.348 --> 02:15:58.683
MAKE THESE VERY VERY.

02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:00.886
DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE

02:16:00.952 --> 02:16:02.787
HOUSING IS BUILT AND WHERE IT IS

02:16:02.854 --> 02:16:08.460
NOT BUILT.

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:10.228
THAT'S A TOUGH -- ONE NO YOU'RE

02:16:10.295 --> 02:16:11.830
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND AND

02:16:11.897 --> 02:16:13.565
I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGING

02:16:13.632 --> 02:16:14.232
THINGS ABOUT THIS ISSUE IS THAT

02:16:14.299 --> 02:16:16.401
AND A AND THE FIRES REALLY

02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:17.769
UNDERSCORED THAT IS THAT HE DOES

02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:18.703
BRING ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER

02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:20.872
WERE USED TO BEING ABLE TO THINK

02:16:20.939 --> 02:16:21.806
ABOUT.

02:16:21.873 --> 02:16:23.942
OUR CLIMATE MITIGATION AND WE

02:16:24.009 --> 02:16:24.809
HAVE SOME OF OUR CLEAN ENERGY

02:16:24.876 --> 02:16:26.244
GOES OVER HERE AND THEN WE HAVE

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:28.313
SOME BRAZILIAN STUFF OVER HERE

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:29.714
AND THEN WE HAVE ALL THIS LIKE.

02:16:29.781 --> 02:16:32.417
EVERY DAY FOCUS ON PLANNING RATE

02:16:32.484 --> 02:16:34.052
AND AND ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

02:16:34.119 --> 02:16:35.487
AND ALL THIS AND ALL THOSE

02:16:35.554 --> 02:16:36.521
THINGS ARE THE SAME THING.

02:16:36.588 --> 02:16:38.323
AND IT -- AND AND I JUST WANT TO

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:39.391
GREW WITH WITH WITH WHOEVER WAS

02:16:39.457 --> 02:16:41.626
YOU SAID -- ADDING ON MORE AND

02:16:41.693 --> 02:16:42.761
MORE AND MORE AND MORE PLANNING

02:16:42.827 --> 02:16:44.629
REQUIREMENTS TO LOCAL

02:16:44.696 --> 02:16:46.131
GOVERNMENTS IS NOT A GREAT

02:16:46.197 --> 02:16:48.166
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BECAUSE

02:16:48.233 --> 02:16:49.000
ESPECIALLY IN MANY OF THESE

02:16:49.067 --> 02:16:50.035
PLACES WERE TALK ABOUT SMALL

02:16:50.101 --> 02:16:51.069
COMMUNITIES WITH.

02:16:51.136 --> 02:16:52.737
VERY FEW PLANNING RESOURCES

02:16:52.804 --> 02:16:53.939
THAT'S ANOTHER THINGTHAT WE

02:16:54.005 --> 02:16:55.473
HEAR EVERY SINGLE TIME WE GO TO

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.741
ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:16:56.808 --> 02:16:58.977
CONVERSATION AS WE DON'T HAVE

02:16:59.044 --> 02:17:01.313
ANY CAPACITY TO BE PLANNING --

02:17:01.379 --> 02:17:02.747
AND SO.

02:17:02.814 --> 02:17:04.683
YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT THAT --

02:17:04.749 --> 02:17:05.951
YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LOT

02:17:06.017 --> 02:17:08.119
ABOUT IT -- PR I I THINK IT'S

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:10.355
IT'S REFLECTED IN THE WORK SOME

02:17:10.422 --> 02:17:12.757
BUSTED ON THE STRIKE FORCE IS

02:17:12.824 --> 02:17:14.526
THE NEED TO START REMAIN

02:17:14.593 --> 02:17:16.161
STREAMING THIS A LITTLE BIT TO

02:17:16.227 --> 02:17:17.662
INCORPORATING SOME OF THESE

02:17:17.729 --> 02:17:19.197
ISSUES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT

02:17:19.264 --> 02:17:20.332
ALL OF OUR AGENTS HE'S BEEN A

02:17:20.398 --> 02:17:21.600
LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT.

02:17:21.666 --> 02:17:23.468
INTO THAT MAINSTREAM THINKING

02:17:23.535 --> 02:17:24.436
AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

02:17:24.502 --> 02:17:26.504
MEAN ADDING ANOTHER LAYER TO A

02:17:26.571 --> 02:17:27.772
GENERAL PLAN IT CAN MEAN.

02:17:27.839 --> 02:17:29.374
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY INCORPORATING

02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:31.209
THESE ISSUES INTO LOCAL

02:17:31.276 --> 02:17:33.211
GOVERNMENT FINANCE INTO HOW WE

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:35.513
THINK ABOUT HOW BUDGETS ARE

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:36.881
CONSTRUCTED HOW WE THINK ABOUT.

02:17:36.948 --> 02:17:38.149
YOU KNOW WHAT HOW WE'RE WE'RE

02:17:38.216 --> 02:17:39.851
GETTING BOND MONEY AND IT WE DO

02:17:39.918 --> 02:17:41.820
KNOW AND AGAIN JUST GOING BACK

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:42.454
TO THE MARKETS WE DO KNOW THAT

02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:43.488
BOND.

02:17:43.555 --> 02:17:45.156
ISSUERS AND BOND RATERS ARE

02:17:45.223 --> 02:17:46.691
PAYING MORE AND MORE ATTENTION

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:48.193
TO THIS SET OF ISSUES BECAUSE

02:17:48.259 --> 02:17:49.527
THE IT IS.

02:17:49.594 --> 02:17:51.229
GONE FROM A LONG TERM RISK TO AN

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:53.298
IMMEDIATE RISK FINANCIALLY.

02:17:53.365 --> 02:17:54.699
AND SO I THINK WILL WILL BE

02:17:54.766 --> 02:17:56.968
FORCED I THINK THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:17:57.035 --> 02:17:58.069
AND STATE LEVEL FRANKLY TO TO BE

02:17:58.136 --> 02:17:59.371
INCORPORATING THAT MORE INTO

02:17:59.437 --> 02:18:00.338
THINKING.

02:18:00.405 --> 02:18:01.573
HOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY PLAY OUT

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:02.741
ON THE GROUND THAT'S THE WORRY

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:04.042
RIGHT IT'S LIKE THAT DOESN'T

02:18:04.109 --> 02:18:07.312
HELP US WITH SOMETHING THAT THE

02:18:07.379 --> 02:18:07.812
PRODUCT PROPOSED TODAY?

02:18:07.879 --> 02:18:08.413
BUT AT LEAST WE SHOULD I THINK

02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:09.648
ALL IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:18:09.714 --> 02:18:11.383
START THINKING ABOUT.

02:18:11.449 --> 02:18:13.752
HOW TO DO THAT HOW TO HOW TO HOW

02:18:13.818 --> 02:18:15.320
TO MODEL THAT IS A STATE

02:18:15.387 --> 02:18:16.755
HONESTLY AND THEN HOW TO THINK

02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:18.189
ABOUT KIND OF INCORPORATING SOME

02:18:18.256 --> 02:18:19.724
OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS INTO?

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:21.326
INTO LOCAL PLAN IT DOES MAKE ME

02:18:21.393 --> 02:18:22.994
NERVOUS TO THINK I WILL ADMIT TO

02:18:23.061 --> 02:18:25.030
THINK ABOUT ADDING ANOTHER LAYER.

02:18:25.096 --> 02:18:26.197
TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:18:26.264 --> 02:18:29.367
RESPONSIBILITIES -- BUT THIS IS

02:18:29.434 --> 02:18:30.735
A REALLY IMPORTANT LAYER SO

02:18:30.802 --> 02:18:31.870
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY WE CAN TRY

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:33.738
TO GET MORE EFFICIENCY BY BUT

02:18:33.805 --> 02:18:35.206
ALSO BRING IN THIS.

02:18:35.273 --> 02:18:35.974
THIS SET OF ISSUES BECAUSE

02:18:36.041 --> 02:18:36.775
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT MEAN

02:18:36.841 --> 02:18:38.777
ARTWORK CONSTRAINED AS A STATE

02:18:38.843 --> 02:18:40.278
BECAUSE ALL THIS IS A LOCAL.

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:41.479
THIS IS ALL LOCAL CONTROL

02:18:41.546 --> 02:18:42.380
EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:45.116
RIGHT NOW -- AND WE HAVE.

02:18:45.183 --> 02:18:46.885
VERY VERY IMPORTANT CLIMATE

02:18:46.951 --> 02:18:48.119
GOALS AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE

02:18:48.186 --> 02:18:49.587
VERY IMPORTANT FISCAL GOALS AT

02:18:49.654 --> 02:18:51.056
THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE AN OVER

02:18:51.122 --> 02:18:52.290
ARCHING GOAL THE GOVERNOR'S

02:18:52.357 --> 02:18:54.059
NUMBER CAN CALL OF OF YOU KNOW

02:18:54.125 --> 02:18:55.427
INCLUSION AND ADDRESSING

02:18:55.493 --> 02:18:56.995
INEQUALITIES ARE ALL RELATED.

02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:58.663
BUT ULTIMATELY THESE PLANNING

02:18:58.730 --> 02:19:00.265
ISSUES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE.

02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:02.067
HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL --

02:19:02.133 --> 02:19:03.835
AND AND SO.

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:05.637
I THINK AT LEAST TODAY OUR

02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:09.474
ABILITY TO AS THE STATE TO CAN

02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:14.879
AFFECT THAT IS FAIRLY LIMITED.

02:19:14.946 --> 02:19:16.815
ON I THIS IS VERY COMPLEX BUT I

02:19:16.881 --> 02:19:18.149
HAVE TO TELL YOU I I THINK IT

02:19:18.216 --> 02:19:19.517
STARTS BACK WITH.

02:19:19.584 --> 02:19:22.220
A CULTURE ISSUE RIGHT WE AS A

02:19:22.287 --> 02:19:24.823
CULTURE.

02:19:24.889 --> 02:19:27.625
NEED TO RETHINK THE WAY WE ARE

02:19:27.692 --> 02:19:29.527
DOING THIS RIGHT.

02:19:29.594 --> 02:19:30.628
WHEN WHEN I LOOK AT SO LIST

02:19:30.695 --> 02:19:32.630
TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT

02:19:32.697 --> 02:19:34.265
THERE ARE COUNTRIES I'VE BEEN TO

02:19:34.332 --> 02:19:35.467
HOLLAND FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A

02:19:35.533 --> 02:19:37.402
MASSIVE FLOODING PROBLEM FOR THE

02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:39.571
LONGEST TIME?

02:19:39.637 --> 02:19:41.639
WE DID THEIR THEIR WHOLE

02:19:41.706 --> 02:19:44.476
INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THE FACT

02:19:44.542 --> 02:19:47.011
THAT THEY PUT MITIGATION EFFORTS

02:19:47.078 --> 02:19:48.813
FIRST BEFORE THEY BUILT.

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:50.148
THEIR COMMUNITIES UP THEY WERE

02:19:50.215 --> 02:19:51.616
GETTING REPETITIVE LOS

02:19:51.683 --> 02:19:53.752
REPETITIVE LOSS RIGHT -- IT WAS

02:19:53.818 --> 02:19:55.720
HARD BECAUSE IT MOVE BUSINESSES

02:19:55.787 --> 02:19:57.188
THAT PRECLUDED WITH BUILDING WAS

02:19:57.255 --> 02:19:58.189
GOING TO GO.

02:19:58.256 --> 02:20:00.992
BUT BUT THEY DID IT AND NOW THEY

02:20:01.059 --> 02:20:03.328
HAVE A BASICALLY ZERO AMOUNT OF

02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:04.896
FLOODING THAT HAPPENS IN THEIR

02:20:04.963 --> 02:20:06.397
MAJOR MAJOR CAPITAL.

02:20:06.464 --> 02:20:07.665
I'VE BEEN TO OTHER PARTS OF THE

02:20:07.732 --> 02:20:09.567
WORLD INDONESIA WHICH HAS

02:20:09.634 --> 02:20:11.903
TSUNAMIS IN CHINA -- THERE ARE

02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:15.106
PLACES WHERE WHERE THE CULTURE.

02:20:15.173 --> 02:20:17.742
DICTATES THE FACT THAT

02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:18.042
[inaudible]

02:20:18.109 --> 02:20:19.677
LOOK.

02:20:19.744 --> 02:20:20.311
MAKE ME FEEL WE'RE GOING TO DO

02:20:20.378 --> 02:20:22.380
THAT FIRST AND THEN WE'RE GOING

02:20:22.447 --> 02:20:24.382
TO BUILD AROUND THAT IDEA.

02:20:24.449 --> 02:20:25.850
BEFORE WE JUST GO.

02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:27.485
BILL FIRST AND THEN BUILD IN A

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:29.220
SAFETY AND SECURITY OR JUST DO

02:20:29.287 --> 02:20:30.855
THE MINIMUM.

02:20:30.922 --> 02:20:32.624
BUILDING CODE OR TO THE MINIMUM --

02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:34.793
THAT'S REQUIRED -- THIS IS

02:20:34.859 --> 02:20:37.495
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHANGE AND

02:20:37.562 --> 02:20:39.964
ASK HAVE BECAUSE FROM A DISASTER

02:20:40.031 --> 02:20:40.965
STANDPOINT.

02:20:41.032 --> 02:20:45.136
THE COST OF THESE FAR OUT TO SEA --

02:20:45.203 --> 02:20:46.204
EXCEEDED.

02:20:46.271 --> 02:20:48.173
AFTERWARDS IN ECONOMIC LOSSES IN

02:20:48.239 --> 02:20:50.074
LIFE LOSSES IN PROPERTY

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:51.476
INFRASTRUCTURE THEN WHAT YOU'RE

02:20:51.543 --> 02:20:52.944
YOU'RE DOING ON THE FRONT END

02:20:53.011 --> 02:20:54.045
BEFORE YOU REPAIR.

02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:55.680
SO EGYPT WE JUST NEED TO THINK

02:20:55.747 --> 02:20:57.315
THROUGH IT DIFFERENTLY AND THE

02:20:57.382 --> 02:20:58.683
MARKETS WILL PROBABLY END UP.

02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:00.785
DRIVING IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE

02:21:00.852 --> 02:21:02.487
YOU KNOW YOU MAY NOT GET -- BE

02:21:02.554 --> 02:21:03.988
ABLE TO GET LOANS OR WHATEVER TO

02:21:04.055 --> 02:21:05.924
DO THIS BUT WE ALSO AT THE STATE

02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:07.659
CONTROL THE PURSE TO SOME DEGREE

02:21:07.725 --> 02:21:09.260
AND WE SHOULD BE.

02:21:09.327 --> 02:21:11.963
DRIVING SOME REQUIREMENTS I KNOW

02:21:12.030 --> 02:21:12.997
THIS BY.

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:14.432
LOCAL GOVERNING OTHER REALLY MAD

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:16.267
AT ME BUT YOU KNOW I THINK WE'D

02:21:16.334 --> 02:21:17.869
HAVE THAT THE TOP DISCUSSION

02:21:17.936 --> 02:21:20.171
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT.

02:21:20.238 --> 02:21:20.805
I DON'T THINK WE'RE REALLY DOING

02:21:20.872 --> 02:21:20.972
IT.

02:21:21.039 --> 02:21:23.341
RIGHT RIGHT NOW.

02:21:23.408 --> 02:21:24.008
FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE

02:21:24.075 --> 02:21:25.677
IT IS GETTING YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:21:25.743 --> 02:21:26.811
JUST TOO MANY REST THE REST.

02:21:26.878 --> 02:21:29.814
AS THE INCREASE IN POPULATION.

02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:31.816
FOR THE MOST POPULOUS STATE --

02:21:31.883 --> 02:21:32.750
COURSE WE GET MORE PEOPLE

02:21:32.817 --> 02:21:34.586
IMPACTED BECAUSE WE ARE THE MOST

02:21:34.652 --> 02:21:37.188
POPULOUS STATE -- BUT IT'S NOT

02:21:37.255 --> 02:21:38.423
JUST HERE VIEW LOOKING ACROSS

02:21:38.489 --> 02:21:39.991
THE COUNTRY IN CLIMATE RELATED

02:21:40.058 --> 02:21:41.326
DISASTER IMPACTS.

02:21:41.392 --> 02:21:42.694
ARE SEVERE THERE REALLY

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.529
SIGNIFICANT AND THERE ARE

02:21:44.596 --> 02:21:45.864
COMMUNITIES GETTING WIPED OUT

02:21:45.930 --> 02:21:48.433
TIME AND TIME LICENSE LIVES LOST --

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:49.667
WHERE THEY COULD HAVE MITIGATED

02:21:49.734 --> 02:21:51.469
SOME OF THAT IN IN IN -- NOT

02:21:51.536 --> 02:21:52.670
BUILDING IN CERTAIN AREAS OR

02:21:52.737 --> 02:21:54.272
DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS SO I

02:21:54.339 --> 02:21:55.073
MEAN I THINK THIS IS A WHOLE

02:21:55.139 --> 02:21:57.008
NOTHER EFFORT JUST TO SIT AND

02:21:57.075 --> 02:21:59.110
TALK ABOUT THAT BUT IT IS A IT

02:21:59.177 --> 02:22:01.946
IS A VERY IMPORTANT.

02:22:02.013 --> 02:22:02.580
THING WILL WE CHANGE OUR THOUGHT

02:22:02.647 --> 02:22:05.650
PROCESS

02:22:05.717 --> 02:22:07.452
CAN I CHIME IN ON THAT JUST.

02:22:07.518 --> 02:22:08.486
MAKE IT VERY QUICK.

02:22:08.553 --> 02:22:11.222
RELATED TO WILDFIRE SPECIFICALLY --

02:22:11.289 --> 02:22:13.324
WE DO HAVE -- A MODEL THAT WE'RE

02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:15.159
UTILIZING THROUGH OUR LAND USE

02:22:15.226 --> 02:22:17.195
PLANNING -- GROUP THAT THAT IS

02:22:17.262 --> 02:22:21.132
WORKING WITH -- LOCAL

02:22:21.199 --> 02:22:23.134
JURISDICTIONS BOTH CITIES AND

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:26.871
COUNTIES PARTICULARLY COUNTIES --

02:22:26.938 --> 02:22:30.174
TO WHEN THEY OPEN THEIR THEIR

02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:31.809
SAFETY ELEMENT OF THEIR GENERAL

02:22:31.876 --> 02:22:33.945
GENERAL PLAN INCORPORATE MANY OF

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:35.013
THE CONCEPTS THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:22:35.079 --> 02:22:36.214
TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY

02:22:36.281 --> 02:22:37.949
PARTICULARLY WHAT.

02:22:38.016 --> 02:22:38.816
WHAT CHIEF RICH ONE WAS TALKING

02:22:38.883 --> 02:22:40.285
ABOUT BUT ALSO THE HOUSING

02:22:40.351 --> 02:22:42.086
ELEMENT WE CAN ALSO GET IN THERE

02:22:42.153 --> 02:22:44.222
AND AT THAT TIME AS WELL I THINK

02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:45.356
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE AN

02:22:45.423 --> 02:22:47.926
OPPORTUNITY -- TO SPREAD THE

02:22:47.992 --> 02:22:50.361
CULTURAL ELEMENT THAT ANYTHING

02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:51.596
DIRECTOR GIL GIGI.

02:22:51.663 --> 02:22:53.097
AND GORDON HAVE BEEN TALKING

02:22:53.164 --> 02:22:54.165
ABOUT WE REALLY NEED TO CHANGE

02:22:54.232 --> 02:22:55.833
THE MINDSET OF THOSE THAT ARE

02:22:55.900 --> 02:22:57.435
DOING THE PLANNING AND APPROVING

02:22:57.502 --> 02:22:58.369
THE PLANS.

02:22:58.436 --> 02:23:00.805
THAT ARE COMING THROUGH AND

02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:02.740
MODELS TO LOOK AT AT THE LOCAL

02:23:02.807 --> 02:23:05.576
LEVEL -- THAT HAS BEEN VERY --

02:23:05.643 --> 02:23:07.779
PROGRESSIVE IS IN SAN DIEGO --

02:23:07.845 --> 02:23:10.581
THEY HAVE A VERY LONG TERM --

02:23:10.648 --> 02:23:12.717
PLANNING PROCESS THAT HAS HAS

02:23:12.784 --> 02:23:17.622
REALLY TIGHTENED -- AND

02:23:17.689 --> 02:23:18.856
ENCOURAGED.

02:23:18.923 --> 02:23:20.024
THIS INCENTIVIZE THE THE

02:23:20.091 --> 02:23:20.959
DEVELOPMENT IN THE BACK COUNTRY

02:23:21.025 --> 02:23:22.961
AND INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT

02:23:23.027 --> 02:23:25.863
IN THE CORRIDOR AREAS WHERE

02:23:25.930 --> 02:23:27.999
THERE'S MORE INFRASTRUCTURE --

02:23:28.066 --> 02:23:31.336
AND THERE'S ALSO AN EXAMPLE --

02:23:31.402 --> 02:23:32.704
TO PREVIOUS POINT.

02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:34.839
THAT OF OF DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS

02:23:34.906 --> 02:23:36.874
BEEN HELD UP FOR YEARS BECAUSE

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:38.609
IT CAN'T MEET FIRE SAFETY

02:23:38.676 --> 02:23:40.478
ELEMENT OF THAT AND IT IS IN THE

02:23:40.545 --> 02:23:41.913
GROWTH SO SO.

02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:43.715
WE DO HAVE THESE AREAS THAT ARE

02:23:43.781 --> 02:23:45.650
KIND OF OUT THERE THAT THAT

02:23:45.717 --> 02:23:48.419
WE'RE WORKING THROUGH AND AND

02:23:48.486 --> 02:23:49.287
THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF WE CAN

02:23:49.354 --> 02:23:50.888
LOOK AT THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:52.223
THAT MIGHT HAVE.

02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:56.394
KIND OF THAT -- STATE -- FLAVOR

02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:58.429
TO THEM THAT WE'RE LOOKING.

02:23:58.496 --> 02:23:59.030
FOR THANK YOU RAIN RUN WE'RE

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:00.565
RUNNING A LITTLE BIT BEHIND BUT

02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:01.799
WE'RE GOING TO LET ASSEMBLY

02:24:01.866 --> 02:24:03.034
MEMBER GALLAGHER AND ASSEMBLY

02:24:03.101 --> 02:24:04.535
MEMBER COOLEY SPEAK IF YOU COULD

02:24:04.602 --> 02:24:05.336
KEEP IT.

02:24:05.403 --> 02:24:06.671
SHORT WE HAVE -- WE'RE RUNNING

02:24:06.738 --> 02:24:08.339
BEHIND WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL

02:24:08.406 --> 02:24:10.842
STILL TO SEE OKAY I WILL TRY TO

02:24:10.908 --> 02:24:13.111
BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE -- LET

02:24:13.177 --> 02:24:14.512
OUT I THINK A LOT OF LEGITIMATE

02:24:14.579 --> 02:24:16.681
CONCERNS BROUGHT UP BY DIFFERENT

02:24:16.748 --> 02:24:19.017
COLLEAGUES TODAY -- BUT I THINK

02:24:19.083 --> 02:24:20.485
DIRECTOR GEAR Là DUDE SHE IS ON

02:24:20.551 --> 02:24:22.153
THE RIGHT TRACK AND WHAT HE SAME

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:23.054
WHICH IS.

02:24:23.121 --> 02:24:25.623
I THINK IT'S LESS ABOUT WHERE WE

02:24:25.690 --> 02:24:27.191
SHOULD BUILD OR NOT BUILD.

02:24:27.258 --> 02:24:29.660
AND MORE ABOUT HOW DO YOU PLAN

02:24:29.727 --> 02:24:31.462
FOR AND PAY THE COST OF

02:24:31.529 --> 02:24:34.065
MITIGATING THE RISK THAT EVERY

02:24:34.132 --> 02:24:35.400
PLACE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:24:35.466 --> 02:24:38.169
HAS -- INSURANCE CAN ALSO PLAY A

02:24:38.236 --> 02:24:39.771
ROLE -- AT THE PLAYS A

02:24:39.837 --> 02:24:42.940
SIGNIFICANT ROLE I MEAN IF YOU

02:24:43.007 --> 02:24:43.574
CAN'T GET INSURANCE [inaudible]

02:24:43.641 --> 02:24:45.209
DESPITE.

02:24:45.276 --> 02:24:47.645
YOUR DOING MITIGATION THE MAYBE

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:49.847
THAT ISN'T A PLACE. TO BUILD BUT

02:24:49.914 --> 02:24:51.716
I THINK IF WE TRY TO OVER

02:24:51.783 --> 02:24:52.984
SIMPLIFY THIS.

02:24:53.051 --> 02:24:54.018
AND START SAYING WELL HERE'S THE

02:24:54.085 --> 02:24:55.420
PLACES IN CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD

02:24:55.486 --> 02:24:57.155
BUILD AND NOT BUILD I THINK

02:24:57.221 --> 02:24:59.023
WE'RE MISSING A MAJOR POINT

02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:01.192
THERE -- AND AND A GREAT PLAN

02:25:01.259 --> 02:25:02.693
MEAN SHOULD WE DO PRIORITIZE

02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:06.064
PLACE THE I. D. PRIORITIZE

02:25:06.130 --> 02:25:07.799
PLACES THAT HAVE EARTHQUAKE RISK.

02:25:07.865 --> 02:25:08.900
AS SHE WE DO PRIORITIZE PLACES

02:25:08.966 --> 02:25:11.335
THAT HAVE FLOOD RISK -- WE'RE

02:25:11.402 --> 02:25:11.903
GONNA START RUNNING OUT OF

02:25:11.969 --> 02:25:13.171
PLACES THAT WE CAN BUILD AND WE

02:25:13.237 --> 02:25:14.772
KNOW WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED

02:25:14.839 --> 02:25:16.808
THOUSAND UNITS. FOR EXAMPLE THAT

02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:19.510
WE NEED TO BUILD TO CATCH UP. TO

02:25:19.577 --> 02:25:20.078
WHERE WE NEED FOR A HOUSING

02:25:20.144 --> 02:25:20.711
DEMAND.

02:25:20.778 --> 02:25:23.848
IN THIS STATE -- I WANT TO

02:25:23.915 --> 02:25:27.285
CONTEXTUALIZE A LITTLE BIT --

02:25:27.351 --> 02:25:27.885
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN MY

02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:28.619
DISTRICT.

02:25:28.686 --> 02:25:30.555
NUMBER ONE I MEAN THIS WAS A ONE

02:25:30.621 --> 02:25:31.923
IN A MILLION FIRE.

02:25:31.989 --> 02:25:33.791
EVERY FIREFIGHTER THAT I'VE

02:25:33.858 --> 02:25:35.259
TALKED TO SAID YOU KNOW.

02:25:35.326 --> 02:25:37.061
WHERE THIS FIRE STARTED IN A

02:25:37.128 --> 02:25:39.564
VERY REMOTE LOCATION HARD TO GET

02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:41.165
TO MADE IT HARD TO GET TO THE

02:25:41.232 --> 02:25:42.500
FIRE EARLY?

02:25:42.567 --> 02:25:44.435
BUT EVEN WITH THAT FIFTY MILE AN

02:25:44.502 --> 02:25:46.471
HOUR WINDS WERE BLOWING EXACTLY

02:25:46.537 --> 02:25:49.340
RIGHT AT COM CAL.

02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:50.741
AND ULTIMATELY PARADISE IN THIS

02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:54.645
FIRE JUMPED TO CANYONS. TWO OF A

02:25:54.712 --> 02:25:55.980
IN A MATTER OF IT IN A MATTER OF

02:25:56.047 --> 02:25:58.483
HOURS IN THE STARTING SPOT FIRES

02:25:58.549 --> 02:25:59.851
IN PARADISE BEFORE ANYBODY.

02:25:59.917 --> 02:26:01.185
WOULD HAVE EVER EXPECTED EVERY

02:26:01.252 --> 02:26:02.553
FIREFIGHTER SAID THIS QUICKLY

02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:04.388
BECAME NOT A FIRE FIGHT BUT A

02:26:04.455 --> 02:26:05.790
LIFESAVING MISSION.

02:26:05.857 --> 02:26:06.958
IMMEDIATELY IT WAS A NATURAL

02:26:07.024 --> 02:26:10.828
DISASTER -- AND YOU KNOW MAYBE

02:26:10.895 --> 02:26:12.497
TO PUT IN AN URBAN CONTENTS AND

02:26:12.563 --> 02:26:14.132
IMAGINE IF WE DID HAVE.

02:26:14.198 --> 02:26:16.134
A LARGE SCALE EARTHQUAKE IN SAN

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:18.169
FRANCISCO OR THE BAY AREA AND IT

02:26:18.236 --> 02:26:19.403
WAS LOCAL FIND SOIL IN THERE WAS

02:26:19.470 --> 02:26:21.105
BUILDINGS FALLING DOWN ALL OVER

02:26:21.172 --> 02:26:23.241
THE PLACE -- YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE

02:26:23.307 --> 02:26:25.176
WERE TRYING TO GET OUT AND

02:26:25.243 --> 02:26:26.077
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY PLACES TO

02:26:26.144 --> 02:26:27.812
GET OUT AND YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:26:27.879 --> 02:26:28.746
EVACUATE.

02:26:28.813 --> 02:26:30.214
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

02:26:30.281 --> 02:26:32.316
FROM AN AREA AND YOU ONLY GOT SO

02:26:32.383 --> 02:26:33.518
MANY BRIDGES IN.

02:26:33.584 --> 02:26:35.186
THE SAME EXACT THING COULD

02:26:35.253 --> 02:26:36.420
HAPPEN YOU KNOW.

02:26:36.487 --> 02:26:38.022
SO LET'S CONTEXTUALIZE A LITTLE

02:26:38.089 --> 02:26:39.423
BIT YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT SEEMS

02:26:39.490 --> 02:26:41.425
LIKE SOME OF THE COMMENTS LIKE

02:26:41.492 --> 02:26:42.026
WELL WE SHOULD ONLY BIRD BUILD

02:26:42.093 --> 02:26:43.995
IN OUR YOU KNOW MAYBE ALREADY

02:26:44.061 --> 02:26:46.197
URBANIZED AREAS AND BUILD

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:47.598
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE.

02:26:47.665 --> 02:26:48.933
AND THAT AND EVEN THE THE

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.334
CONTENTION THAT THAT'S WHERE THE

02:26:50.401 --> 02:26:51.736
HIGH PERFORMING SCHOOLS ARE --

02:26:51.802 --> 02:26:52.837
AND REALLY -- IS WE HAVE HIGH

02:26:52.904 --> 02:26:54.906
PERFORMING SCHOOLS TO AND WE

02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:56.774
HAVE ACCESS TO JOBS.

02:26:56.841 --> 02:26:58.743
IN ON ALL OF THAT -- BUT IMAGINE

02:26:58.809 --> 02:27:00.411
THOSE URBAN AREAS HAVE SOME SOME

02:27:00.478 --> 02:27:04.582
HIGH RISK TO UNDER THE RIGHT

02:27:04.649 --> 02:27:06.317
I THINK JUST FOCUSING ON HEY

02:27:06.384 --> 02:27:08.586
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE'RE

02:27:08.653 --> 02:27:09.820
GOING TO BUILD THIS IS.

02:27:09.887 --> 02:27:10.454
IS KIND OF THE WRONG WAY TO LOOK

02:27:10.521 --> 02:27:12.690
AT IT.

02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:14.625
UNDERSTAND THIS ABOUT PARADISE.

02:27:14.692 --> 02:27:15.960
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

02:27:16.027 --> 02:27:17.461
PEOPLE MOVE THERE BECAUSE THEY

02:27:17.528 --> 02:27:20.765
WANTED TO NOT BECAUSE THEY HAD.

02:27:20.831 --> 02:27:21.966
TO YES THERE WAS AFFORDABLE

02:27:22.033 --> 02:27:23.334
HOUSING UP THERE AND FOR SOME

02:27:23.401 --> 02:27:24.835
THAT WAS THE THING.

02:27:24.902 --> 02:27:26.771
BUT IF YOU KNOW THIS COMMUNITY

02:27:26.837 --> 02:27:28.272
PEOPLE WANTED TO LIVE THERE.

02:27:28.339 --> 02:27:30.041
IT WAS WHERE THEY IT HAS A VERY

02:27:30.107 --> 02:27:31.342
STRONG PLATE SENSE OF PLACE AND

02:27:31.409 --> 02:27:32.877
COMMUNITY AND IT'S BEEN THERE

02:27:32.944 --> 02:27:34.845
FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS THIS

02:27:34.912 --> 02:27:36.047
WASN'T A COMMUNITY THAT JUST.

02:27:36.113 --> 02:27:37.815
YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF GROWTH

02:27:37.882 --> 02:27:39.417
PATTERNS ALL THE SUDDEN APPEARED.

02:27:39.483 --> 02:27:40.585
YOU KNOW HERE IN THE LAST TWENTY

02:27:40.651 --> 02:27:42.687
YEARS IT'S IT'S BEEN THERE FOR A

02:27:42.753 --> 02:27:45.523
VERY LONG TIME -- CLIMB IT MEANS

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:48.259
WE HAVE MANY AREAS OF RISK FOR

02:27:48.326 --> 02:27:49.927
EXAMPLE RISING SEA LEVEL. FOR

02:27:49.994 --> 02:27:51.062
EXAMPLE AFFECTS COASTAL

02:27:51.128 --> 02:27:52.763
COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE MOSTLY

02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:54.198
URBAN.

02:27:54.265 --> 02:27:57.235
COMMUNITIES RIGHT -- AND YOU

02:27:57.301 --> 02:27:59.370
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO JUST

02:27:59.437 --> 02:28:00.938
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

02:28:01.005 --> 02:28:02.974
URBAN PARTS.

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:03.674
OF THE STATE.

02:28:03.741 --> 02:28:05.943
IT WITH THE MARKET FORCES ARE

02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:07.311
THE HIGH COST.

02:28:07.378 --> 02:28:09.213
OF THAT THE KOREAN LAND AND ALL

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.815
THE REGULATIONS AND RULES YOU'RE

02:28:10.881 --> 02:28:12.016
GONNA HAVE TO DO A HUGE TAX

02:28:12.083 --> 02:28:15.019
SUBSIDY -- TO GET PEOPLE DOWN TO

02:28:15.086 --> 02:28:17.121
RENTS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:18.489
PRICES ARE AFFORDABLE.

02:28:18.556 --> 02:28:20.524
SO LOOK YOU DO HAVE TO LOOK AT

02:28:20.591 --> 02:28:22.026
RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. TO

02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:23.995
MEET OUR AFFORDABILITY AND

02:28:24.061 --> 02:28:26.964
HOUSING DEMANDS AND UNDERSTAND

02:28:27.031 --> 02:28:27.598
IS THIS IS WHERE I THINK I PLAY

02:28:27.665 --> 02:28:28.599
A ROLE.

02:28:28.666 --> 02:28:30.401
IS THAT I OFTEN DO THIS IS I'M

02:28:30.468 --> 02:28:33.404
TRYING TO BRING. TO EXPLAIN WHAT

02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:34.939
RURAL CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:36.107
LIFE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK A LOT

02:28:36.173 --> 02:28:37.608
OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEEN THERE

02:28:37.675 --> 02:28:40.077
AND THAT'S WHY DO SO MANY TOURS.

02:28:40.144 --> 02:28:41.312
UP INTO MY DISTRICT IN AND

02:28:41.379 --> 02:28:43.114
ASSEMBLYMAN DOLLY DOES THE SAME

02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:45.916
THING -- NOT ALL OF RURAL

02:28:45.983 --> 02:28:47.318
CALIFORNIA IS THE SAME THERE'S A

02:28:47.385 --> 02:28:48.586
PRETTY BIG DIVERSITY OF

02:28:48.653 --> 02:28:49.787
GEOGRAPHY.

02:28:49.854 --> 02:28:52.356
UP THERE AND OUT THERE IN.

02:28:52.423 --> 02:28:53.724
YOU KNOW IN THE HINTERLANDS IF

02:28:53.791 --> 02:28:55.926
YOU WILL -- SO FOR EXAMPLE BUTTE

02:28:55.993 --> 02:28:57.962
COUNTY PARADISE YES IS IN A

02:28:58.029 --> 02:28:59.497
MOUNTAINOUS WOODED AREA.

02:28:59.563 --> 02:29:02.233
BUT THERE'S A LARGE PORTION OF

02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:02.833
BUTTE COUNTY THIS DOWN IN THE

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:03.200
VALLEY.

02:29:03.267 --> 02:29:04.568
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T HAVE FIRE

02:29:04.635 --> 02:29:06.804
RISK SO CAN KIND OF LOOKING AT

02:29:06.871 --> 02:29:07.405
BUTTE COUNTY AS THE WHOLE AREA

02:29:07.471 --> 02:29:10.574
IS A YOU KNOW A LOUIS.

02:29:10.641 --> 02:29:12.810
IS NOT ACCURATE IT'S WRONG --

02:29:12.877 --> 02:29:14.078
AND THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

02:29:14.145 --> 02:29:15.846
TO BUILD TRULY AFFORDABLE MARKET

02:29:15.913 --> 02:29:18.282
RATE HOUSING IMMORAL PARTS OF

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:20.351
THE STATE IF WE LOOK AT EXISTING

02:29:20.418 --> 02:29:21.819
COMMUNITIES SO EXAMPLE IN BUTTE

02:29:21.886 --> 02:29:23.220
COUNTY WE HAVE.

02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:25.323
THE CITIES OF CHICO AND BILL

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:27.858
BIGGS AND GRIDLEY THEIR EXISTING

02:29:27.925 --> 02:29:29.126
COMMUNITIES.

02:29:29.193 --> 02:29:31.162
WHERE LAND ACQUISITION AND OTHER

02:29:31.228 --> 02:29:33.197
COSTS ARE MUCH CHEAPER WE COULD

02:29:33.264 --> 02:29:35.366
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S

02:29:35.433 --> 02:29:38.836
NOT IN THE HI FIRE HAZARDS --

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:39.637
THESE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO SO

02:29:39.704 --> 02:29:40.638
JUST.

02:29:40.705 --> 02:29:41.439
I WANT TO REALLY PUSH BACK

02:29:41.505 --> 02:29:43.507
AGAINST MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:45.242
BIAS TOWARDS A WE CAN OF WE GOT

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:46.677
A STANDARD BEEN AREAS WE CAN'T

02:29:46.744 --> 02:29:48.212
GO OUT AND RURAL AREAS.

02:29:48.279 --> 02:29:49.747
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

02:29:49.814 --> 02:29:51.382
THAT'S NOT TRUE I MEAN IF YOU

02:29:51.449 --> 02:29:52.750
REALLY LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE

02:29:52.817 --> 02:29:54.485
CHARACTER IN THE DIVERSITY OF

02:29:54.552 --> 02:29:56.654
THESE REGIONS -- RURAL

02:29:56.721 --> 02:29:59.290
DEVELOPMENT -- YOU KNOW CAN BE

02:29:59.357 --> 02:30:01.258
DONE YOU KNOW AS I SAID AROUND

02:30:01.325 --> 02:30:02.860
THESE EXISTING COMMUNITIES.

02:30:02.927 --> 02:30:03.961
THAT REBUILDING IN A PLACE LIKE

02:30:04.028 --> 02:30:05.663
PARADISE.

02:30:05.730 --> 02:30:07.164
I THINK CAN BE DONE.

02:30:07.231 --> 02:30:08.599
YOU KNOW IT'S A MATTER OF

02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:10.334
MITIGATING THAT RISK AND I THINK

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:12.136
WE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW DO WE MAKE

02:30:12.203 --> 02:30:13.671
SURE THAT HIS BILL BETTER AND

02:30:13.738 --> 02:30:15.973
MORE RESILIENT -- AND GETTING

02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:17.942
BACK TO PLANNING.

02:30:18.008 --> 02:30:19.243
THANKS THIS YEAR IN ABOUT A

02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:21.612
BREWING COMPANY WHO MADE A LARGE

02:30:21.679 --> 02:30:22.980
DONATION TO THIS THEY HAVE A

02:30:23.047 --> 02:30:25.015
PLANNER RIGHT NOW IN THE IN THE

02:30:25.082 --> 02:30:27.918
TOWN OF PARADISE IN A CHURCH

02:30:27.985 --> 02:30:30.020
THAT STILL STANDING UP THERE --

02:30:30.087 --> 02:30:31.522
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERING

02:30:31.589 --> 02:30:33.491
AND THEY'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS

02:30:33.557 --> 02:30:35.226
ABOUT HOW DO WE BUILD SMARTER.

02:30:35.292 --> 02:30:36.360
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:30:36.427 --> 02:30:37.928
SAFER HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:30:37.995 --> 02:30:40.498
ROADWAYS CONNECTED DON'T DEAD

02:30:40.564 --> 02:30:42.867
END -- AND THEY'RE HAVING THOSE

02:30:42.933 --> 02:30:44.034
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW THEY

02:30:44.101 --> 02:30:45.469
TRULY MITIGATE.

02:30:45.536 --> 02:30:47.738
THE RISK FOR THIS COMMUNITY AND

02:30:47.805 --> 02:30:49.440
AND AND I THINK IT CAN BE DONE

02:30:49.507 --> 02:30:50.741
THIS CAN BE A MUCH SAFER

02:30:50.808 --> 02:30:52.076
RESILIENT.

02:30:52.143 --> 02:30:53.978
COMMUNITY IN THE LONG TERM THAT

02:30:54.044 --> 02:30:56.881
SHOULD BE OUR GOAL -- NOT TO SAY

02:30:56.947 --> 02:30:59.016
OH NO YOU NEVER YOU KNOW --

02:30:59.083 --> 02:31:00.017
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BUILD

02:31:00.084 --> 02:31:02.787
AND AND AND A PLACE AGAIN -- AND

02:31:02.853 --> 02:31:04.722
A AND M. AND NOBODY IS IGNORING

02:31:04.789 --> 02:31:06.323
THAT RISK [inaudible]

02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:08.692
WHATSOEVER -- IT'S SOMETHING I

02:31:08.759 --> 02:31:10.261
THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY COGNIZANT

02:31:10.327 --> 02:31:13.330
OF BUT YOU KNOW THE ISSUE SHOULD

02:31:13.397 --> 02:31:14.632
REALLY BE HEY HOW DO WE REALLY

02:31:14.698 --> 02:31:15.766
MAKE SURE THAT'S BETTER IN FOR

02:31:15.833 --> 02:31:18.202
AN AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN

02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:19.303
BROUGHT UP I THINK WE DO NEED.

02:31:19.370 --> 02:31:20.671
A MUCH BETTER ENFORCEMENT

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:22.640
MECHANISM. FOR ENSURING THE

02:31:22.706 --> 02:31:24.175
DEFENSIBLE SPACE ACTUALLY

02:31:24.241 --> 02:31:26.076
HAPPENS AND YOU CAN BE ENFORCED

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:27.244
AND AND THAT THERE ARE

02:31:27.311 --> 02:31:29.914
CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT DOING IT --

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:32.183
BECAUSE THAT WAS A HUGE ISSUE --

02:31:32.249 --> 02:31:33.617
FOR EXAMPLE IN PARADISE.

02:31:33.684 --> 02:31:35.319
BUILDING HOUSING SO THAT THE

02:31:35.386 --> 02:31:38.055
EMBERS CAN'T GET UNDERNEATH THE

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:39.323
EASE MANY OF THE HOUSES IN

02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:41.025
PARADISE BURNED DOWN FROM THE

02:31:41.091 --> 02:31:42.426
INSIDE OUT.

02:31:42.493 --> 02:31:44.261
BECAUSE EMBERS GOT INSIDE TO THE

02:31:44.328 --> 02:31:45.262
EAVES.

02:31:45.329 --> 02:31:47.198
IT WASN'T AND AND IT WAS A VERY

02:31:47.264 --> 02:31:48.999
QUICK BURNING FIERY IT WOULDN'T

02:31:49.066 --> 02:31:50.434
NECESSARILY HAVE TAKEN OUT AS

02:31:50.501 --> 02:31:51.735
MANY HOUSING.

02:31:51.802 --> 02:31:54.171
AS MUCH HOUSING HAD IT BEEN

02:31:54.238 --> 02:31:56.373
BUILT TO BETTER STANDARDS -- IN

02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:58.609
THE FIRST PLACE AND THE COST

02:31:58.676 --> 02:32:00.911
ACTUALLY FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION.

02:32:00.978 --> 02:32:02.313
TO BUILD A MORE FIRE RESILIENT

02:32:02.379 --> 02:32:03.681
HOUSE VERSUS THE OLDER STANDARDS

02:32:03.747 --> 02:32:05.950
THE COST IS VERY NEGLIGIBLE

02:32:06.016 --> 02:32:07.585
THERE'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE.

02:32:07.651 --> 02:32:10.020
SO WE CAN DO THAT AND STILL DO

02:32:10.087 --> 02:32:12.556
IT IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY --

02:32:12.623 --> 02:32:14.625
AND THEN IN THE LONG TERM.

02:32:14.692 --> 02:32:15.926
WE DO HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES

02:32:15.993 --> 02:32:17.995
ARE FIRE RESILIENT RATE THAT

02:32:18.062 --> 02:32:19.363
RIGHT NOW TODAY NEED TO BE

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:20.731
RETROFITTED.

02:32:20.798 --> 02:32:22.299
THAT'S WHERE THE EXPENSES IS

02:32:22.366 --> 02:32:23.701
PRETTY TOUGH TO GET THERE RIGHT

02:32:23.767 --> 02:32:25.135
AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HEY

02:32:25.202 --> 02:32:26.804
HOW CAN WE DO AS IT LOW COST

02:32:26.871 --> 02:32:28.372
LOANS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD.

02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:29.507
HAS LEGISLATION THAT HE'S

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:31.175
WORKING ON RIGHT NOW THE MAYBE

02:32:31.242 --> 02:32:32.843
CAN ASSIST PEOPLE AND MAKING

02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:34.578
SURE THEIR HOMES ARE RETROFITTED

02:32:34.645 --> 02:32:38.115
TO BECOME -- MORE FIRE RESILIENT --

02:32:38.182 --> 02:32:39.116
AND THAT WOULD BE A GETS

02:32:39.183 --> 02:32:40.885
EXPENDITURE OF MONEY THAT WOULD

02:32:40.951 --> 02:32:41.752
BE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY THAT WE

02:32:41.819 --> 02:32:42.253
COULD.

02:32:42.319 --> 02:32:44.755
NOT IT WOULD BE LITTLE IS GOING

02:32:44.822 --> 02:32:45.322
TO BE SIGNIFICANT BUT ID BE

02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:46.824
MONEY.

02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:49.126
WELL SPENT BECAUSE WHAT'S THE

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:50.561
COST OF A DISASTER AND I THINK

02:32:50.628 --> 02:32:51.962
THAT WAS A GREAT POINT THE CASA

02:32:52.029 --> 02:32:55.900
DISASTERS.

02:32:55.966 --> 02:32:57.835
MY IS EXPONENTIAL SO IF WE CAN

02:32:57.902 --> 02:32:58.903
IF WE CAN DO SOME OF THESE

02:32:58.969 --> 02:33:00.271
THINGS AND REALLY THINK ABOUT

02:33:00.337 --> 02:33:01.672
HEY HOW DO WE REALLY.

02:33:01.739 --> 02:33:03.541
PAY THE COST OF AND MITIGATE

02:33:03.607 --> 02:33:06.610
RISK -- WE CAN MEET OUR HOUSING

02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:08.045
GOALS.

02:33:08.112 --> 02:33:09.547
AND WE CAN  WE CAN

02:33:09.613 --> 02:33:11.549
SAFER AND MORE RESILIENT

02:33:11.615 --> 02:33:13.317
COMMUNITIES LONG TERM -- AND I

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:14.919
AND I IN A AND I THINK THAT'S

02:33:14.985 --> 02:33:15.819
WHERE THE AGREEMENT NEEDS TO

02:33:15.886 --> 02:33:17.421
COME AROUND AS IS FIGURE OUT HOW

02:33:17.488 --> 02:33:18.923
WE DO THAT.

02:33:18.989 --> 02:33:20.624
RATHER THAN GETTING INTO A WILL

02:33:20.691 --> 02:33:22.560
HATE THIS PLACE WE'RE NOT GOING

02:33:22.626 --> 02:33:24.461
TO BUILD WE'RE ONLY GOING TO

02:33:24.528 --> 02:33:25.829
BUILD HERE AND I JUST THINK

02:33:25.896 --> 02:33:27.097
THAT'S THE WRONG WAY TO

02:33:27.164 --> 02:33:28.332
CONCEPTUALIZE IT THAT'S ALL.

02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:29.600
THANK YOU SO REMEMBER GALLAGHER

02:33:29.667 --> 02:33:32.102
AND OUR FINALS A QUESTION SOME

02:33:32.169 --> 02:33:33.537
REMEMBER COOLEY.

02:33:33.604 --> 02:33:35.306
WELL I HAVE MORE COMMENTS I WANT

02:33:35.372 --> 02:33:36.707
TO SAY ACTUALLY I AGREE WITH MR

02:33:36.774 --> 02:33:38.442
GALLAGHER'S POINT.

02:33:38.509 --> 02:33:40.344
I THINK WOULD BE AS SERIOUS

02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:43.847
FAILURE THE INSTITUTION. TO NOT

02:33:43.914 --> 02:33:44.682
BE HAVING A STATEWIDE SOLUTION.

02:33:44.748 --> 02:33:46.450
RURAL VERSUS URBAN.

02:33:46.517 --> 02:33:48.152
I JUST THINK WE CAN'T SOLVE A

02:33:48.218 --> 02:33:50.020
PROBLEM THAT WAY.

02:33:50.087 --> 02:33:51.555
RURAL AREAS YOU TEND TO HAVE

02:33:51.622 --> 02:33:53.190
LARGER LOT SIZES AND FRANKLY I

02:33:53.257 --> 02:33:54.358
THINK YOU COULD ROUND REVERT

02:33:54.425 --> 02:33:55.759
RURAL AREAS.

02:33:55.826 --> 02:33:57.061
YOU REALIZE.

02:33:57.127 --> 02:33:59.196
ON OFF A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH

02:33:59.263 --> 02:34:00.364
THOSE LARGER LOT SIZES.

02:34:00.431 --> 02:34:01.966
THEY'VE TAKEN CARE OF THEIR

02:34:02.032 --> 02:34:03.067
PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:34:03.133 --> 02:34:05.035
EXPECT THAT IF THERE'S A FIRE

02:34:05.102 --> 02:34:07.037
THAT THE FIRE SERVICE TO GET

02:34:07.104 --> 02:34:07.671
THERE SOONER UP TO TAKE CARE OF

02:34:07.738 --> 02:34:08.505
THEM.

02:34:08.572 --> 02:34:10.007
SO MUCH MORE THAN OUR SERBAN

02:34:10.074 --> 02:34:11.642
DWELLERS IT'S A MATTER OF SELF

02:34:11.709 --> 02:34:13.978
PRESERVATION TO TRY TO CREATE

02:34:14.044 --> 02:34:15.346
DEFENSIBLE SPACE IF YOU HAVE.

02:34:15.412 --> 02:34:17.715
URBAN OR RURAL PROPERTY.

02:34:17.781 --> 02:34:19.316
I THINK AS YOU MOVE FORWARD I

02:34:19.383 --> 02:34:20.451
THINK THIS.

02:34:20.517 --> 02:34:22.886
TIME IS TO IDEAS OF HOW DO WE

02:34:22.953 --> 02:34:24.755
MEET OUR HOUSING NEEDS HOW TO

02:34:24.822 --> 02:34:26.490
ADDRESS OUR OUR FIRE RISK OR

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:28.292
DISASTER RISK.

02:34:28.359 --> 02:34:29.693
I ACTUALLY THINK COLLEAGUES WERE

02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:31.128
SORT OF IN AN ERA OF NEEDING A

02:34:31.195 --> 02:34:33.831
CALIFORNIA TYPE OF MARSHALL PLAN.

02:34:33.897 --> 02:34:34.865
WE NEED TO SCALE UP OUR

02:34:34.932 --> 02:34:37.134
SOLUTIONS TO DO WITH THESE TWO

02:34:37.201 --> 02:34:38.736
GREAT CHALLENGES.

02:34:38.802 --> 02:34:39.903
THAT BIND THE FUTURE STATE

02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:42.006
TOGETHER.

02:34:42.072 --> 02:34:43.507
IN A CONCERTED WAY.

02:34:43.574 --> 02:34:44.842
AND AND I JUST WANT TO OFFER THE

02:34:44.908 --> 02:34:46.310
OBSERVATION THAT WHEN USED AS

02:34:46.377 --> 02:34:48.779
LAWMAKERS.

02:34:48.846 --> 02:34:49.913
SAY WHAT THE HECK OF THE TOOLS

02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:51.815
ARE TOOL KIT.

02:34:51.882 --> 02:34:54.018
THEY ARE MORE THAN MONEY.

02:34:54.084 --> 02:34:56.053
THERE ARE MORE THAN PROGRAMMATIC

02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:57.621
I THINK AS LAWMAKERS.

02:34:57.688 --> 02:34:59.857
ARE JOB REALLY IS TO ASK HOW DO

02:34:59.923 --> 02:35:00.391
WE RELEASE ENERGY ON THIS

02:35:00.457 --> 02:35:01.992
PROBLEM.

02:35:02.059 --> 02:35:03.827
MONEY MAY BE A WAY A NEW PROGRAM

02:35:03.894 --> 02:35:05.496
MAY BE AWAY WE KNEW IT REALLY

02:35:05.562 --> 02:35:07.564
DOES HELP WHAT OTHER DYNAMICS

02:35:07.631 --> 02:35:08.899
WHERE YOU CAN AFFECT THE

02:35:08.966 --> 02:35:10.300
CHEMISTRY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING.

02:35:10.367 --> 02:35:11.535
IN PEOPLE'S HEADS AT THE LOCAL

02:35:11.602 --> 02:35:14.138
LEVEL COURSE I WAS FIRST B. P.

02:35:14.204 --> 02:35:15.139
OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES SO

02:35:15.205 --> 02:35:16.807
ALMOST PRESENT LEICA COME TO

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:18.375
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

02:35:18.442 --> 02:35:19.543
I SEE MY COLLEAGUES WHY SO SHE

02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:22.012
WITH THE SENATE JUDICIARY

02:35:22.079 --> 02:35:22.680
COMMITTEE IN THE ROOM.

02:35:22.746 --> 02:35:24.314
I THINK I WOULD SAY WE OUGHT TO

02:35:24.381 --> 02:35:26.083
BE GOING TO THE CIVIL CODE WHICH

02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:28.419
I HAD MY STAFF BRING TO ME. TO

02:35:28.485 --> 02:35:29.520
JUST SPEND A LITTLE TIME

02:35:29.586 --> 02:35:30.788
THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM IN

02:35:30.854 --> 02:35:34.124
LIGHT OF CIVIL CODE PROVISIONS.

02:35:34.191 --> 02:35:34.892
ELEVEN OH TWO THE TRANSFER

02:35:34.958 --> 02:35:36.694

02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:37.995
IN.

02:35:38.062 --> 02:35:39.196
NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE TRYING TO

02:35:39.263 --> 02:35:41.165
PROVE DISCLOSURES ON PROPERTY --

02:35:41.231 --> 02:35:43.033
THE NATURAL DISASTER DISCLOSURE

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:44.268
STATEMENT ELEVEN OH THREE THE

02:35:44.334 --> 02:35:46.336
CIVIL CODE.

02:35:46.403 --> 02:35:47.471
NINETEEN NINETY NINE LOOKING AT

02:35:47.538 --> 02:35:48.972
FIRE FLOOD.

02:35:49.039 --> 02:35:50.674
EARTHQUAKE.

02:35:50.741 --> 02:35:51.875
BECAUSE ACTION WHEN YOU READ

02:35:51.942 --> 02:35:53.811
THOSE TO JUST THOSE TWO

02:35:53.877 --> 02:35:54.878
PROVISIONS.

02:35:54.945 --> 02:35:55.879
YOU'LL START REALIZING OLDER'S

02:35:55.946 --> 02:35:57.614
MAPS OUT THERE THE PEOPLE OF

02:35:57.681 --> 02:35:59.149
CREATED TO GET FILED THE LOCAL

THAT SENDS A HEIGHTENED LEVEL

02:36:05.155 --> 02:36:07.491
RESPONSIBLE TO THE SYSTEM.

02:36:07.558 --> 02:36:08.926
I WOULD SAY.

02:36:08.992 --> 02:36:10.260
THAT WE MAY NEED OTHER SOLUTIONS

02:36:10.327 --> 02:36:11.662
BUT HONESTLY I THINK WE WOULD

02:36:11.729 --> 02:36:13.731
ENLARGE OUR FRAME OF REFERENCE

02:36:13.797 --> 02:36:16.200
ON THIS CONVERSATION. TO LOOK AT

02:36:16.266 --> 02:36:17.634
HOW THE TRANSFER DISCLOSURE

THE NATURAL HAZARD DISCLOSURE

02:36:24.908 --> 02:36:26.810
STATEMENT.

02:36:26.877 --> 02:36:28.445
THE STRUCTURES ARE OUT THERE THE

02:36:28.512 --> 02:36:30.114
WAY INFORMATION GETS ON MAPS

02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:32.783
RATED INUNDATION EXPOSURE AND

02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:33.383
HOW THAT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH

02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:36.520
THE THE HOUSING SYSTEM.

02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:37.688
AND NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO A

02:36:37.755 --> 02:36:39.156
CONVERSATION WHERE I THINK IT'S

02:36:39.223 --> 02:36:40.424
MORE OF THE RELEASE OF ENERGY

02:36:40.491 --> 02:36:41.492
CATEGORY.

02:36:41.558 --> 02:36:43.293
WHAT CAN YOU DO IN A NEW WANTS

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:45.329
WAY THIS STARTS GIVING PEOPLE

02:36:45.395 --> 02:36:46.663
MORE OF A STAKE IN THE SOLUTION?

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:48.899
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED

02:36:48.966 --> 02:36:50.801
HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT I

02:36:50.868 --> 02:36:54.972
DEFINITELY AGREE -- RURAL FOLKS

02:36:55.038 --> 02:36:56.106
THEY REPRESENT A DIFFERENT

02:36:56.173 --> 02:36:56.940
ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM BUT

02:36:57.007 --> 02:36:58.275
ACTUALLY THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF

02:36:58.342 --> 02:37:00.077
SELF HELP INTEGRAL TO WHAT IS

02:37:00.144 --> 02:37:01.078
DONE.

02:37:01.145 --> 02:37:03.347
I DO THINK THE PARADISE FIRE WAS

02:37:03.413 --> 02:37:06.750
VERY UNIQUE EVENT -- AND THAT'S

02:37:06.817 --> 02:37:08.085
NOT TO SAY THAT WE THEREFORE.

02:37:08.152 --> 02:37:09.686
DON'T TREAT IS A DATA SET WHAT

02:37:09.753 --> 02:37:12.022
HAPPENED SANTA ROSA AS WAS

02:37:12.089 --> 02:37:13.323
POINTED OUT VERY UNIQUE EVENT.

02:37:13.390 --> 02:37:14.992
WE SORT OF NEED TO LOOK AT HOW

02:37:15.058 --> 02:37:16.493
THESE DIFFERENT FACT THINGS

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:18.128
FACTORED SOLUTION.

02:37:18.195 --> 02:37:19.797
BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS IS A

02:37:19.863 --> 02:37:20.898
PLACE FOR THE STATE THESE

02:37:20.964 --> 02:37:22.032
LEADERSHIP I THINK IT NEEDS A

02:37:22.099 --> 02:37:23.600
MARSHALL PLAN.

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:24.635
THE GOVERNOR USE OUT ON AN

02:37:24.701 --> 02:37:26.970
OPERATION EXPECTED HOMELESS.

02:37:27.037 --> 02:37:28.505
I THINK I AGREE WITH THATBUT I

02:37:28.572 --> 02:37:29.473
THINK WE NEED THE SAME SORT OF

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:31.942
EMPHASIS ON THE FIRE ISSUE.

02:37:32.009 --> 02:37:32.643
THAT IS WHERE THE STATE OF

02:37:32.709 --> 02:37:34.578
CALIFORNIA COULD ORCHESTRATE

02:37:34.645 --> 02:37:35.746
SOLUTIONS FOR FORTY MILLION

02:37:35.813 --> 02:37:37.347
CALIFORNIANS BUT I THINK IT'S

02:37:37.414 --> 02:37:39.249
MORE THAN MONEY AND MORE THAN

02:37:39.316 --> 02:37:41.385
PROGRAMS WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW

02:37:41.451 --> 02:37:42.653
DO YORKERS AFFECT PEOPLE'S

02:37:42.719 --> 02:37:43.687

THIS RELEASE OF ENERGY CONCEPT

02:37:45.823 --> 02:37:46.790
WHICH I THINK.

02:37:46.857 --> 02:37:49.326
AS LAWMAKERS AND PARTNERS A

02:37:49.393 --> 02:37:49.893

NIGHT OF OCTOBER EIGHTH.

02:40:03.660 --> 02:40:04.227
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WOKE

GLOW FIRE IN THE DISTANCE.

02:40:07.364 --> 02:40:09.099

WIFE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE IN A

02:40:11.068 --> 02:40:12.469
MOBILE HOME PARK IN SANTA ROSA.

02:40:12.536 --> 02:40:13.637
UNFORTUNATELY WE ENDED UP

02:40:13.704 --> 02:40:16.073
EVACUATING GRANDMA IS WELL IN

02:40:16.139 --> 02:40:17.708
HER PARK WAS LARGELY DESTROYED

02:40:17.774 --> 02:40:19.076
BY EIGHT IN ENTIRELY SEPARATE

02:40:19.142 --> 02:40:22.279
FAR THE ROAD INTO SANTA ROSA

02:40:22.346 --> 02:40:23.413
FROM THE NORTHEAST THAT NIGHT.

02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:25.382
DESPITE OUR EXPERIENCE LOSING A

02:40:25.449 --> 02:40:27.317
HOME THAT WE DEARLY LOVED JUST

02:40:27.384 --> 02:40:29.052
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WE OWNED

02:40:29.119 --> 02:40:30.854
AND ONE OF OUR TWO DOGS.

02:40:30.921 --> 02:40:32.823
I CONSIDER OUR FAMILY TO HAVE

02:40:32.889 --> 02:40:34.524
BEEN INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE WE

02:40:34.591 --> 02:40:35.926
WERE SPARED THE HORRIFYING

02:40:35.993 --> 02:40:37.327
EXPERIENCES THAT MANY OF MY

02:40:37.394 --> 02:40:39.363
NEIGHBORS WENT THROUGH.

02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:41.064
RUSHING OUT OF THEIR HOMES WITH

02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:42.466
THEIR YARDS ALREADY ON FIRE

02:40:42.532 --> 02:40:44.401
ABANDONING BURNING CARS AND

02:40:44.468 --> 02:40:46.036
STRIKING OUT ON FOOT.

02:40:46.103 --> 02:40:47.104
CUTTING THROUGH BARBED WIRE

02:40:47.170 --> 02:40:48.572
FENCE AND DRIVING OVER LAND WITH

02:40:48.638 --> 02:40:49.906
A CAR FULL OF KIDS WHEN THE

02:40:49.973 --> 02:40:51.174
ROADS WERE BLOCKED BY FIRE AND

02:40:51.241 --> 02:40:52.843
FALLEN TREES.

02:40:52.909 --> 02:40:54.644
SHELTERING IN PLACE WHILE THE

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:56.413
HOMES AROUND THEM BURNED IN

02:40:56.480 --> 02:40:57.948
LARGE NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET

02:40:58.015 --> 02:40:59.783
WHO PASSED AWAY IN HIS HOME.

02:40:59.850 --> 02:41:01.385
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET OUT.

02:41:01.451 --> 02:41:03.120
OVER 70% OF THE HOMES IN MY

02:41:03.186 --> 02:41:04.721
NEIGHBORHOOD WERE DESTROYED IN

02:41:04.788 --> 02:41:07.290
JUST UNDER HALF OF THESE.

02:41:07.357 --> 02:41:08.425
OUR UNDER ALL ARE NOW BEING

02:41:08.492 --> 02:41:10.027
REBUILT ALMOST TWO YEARS AFTER

02:41:10.093 --> 02:41:11.094
THE EVENT.

02:41:11.161 --> 02:41:12.596
BUT THAT MEANS THAT MORE THAN

02:41:12.662 --> 02:41:13.930
HALF OF OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE NOT

02:41:13.997 --> 02:41:15.298
YET STARTED REBUILDING.

02:41:15.365 --> 02:41:16.733
SOME CAN'T AFFORD IT TOO

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:18.735
PERVASIVE OVER UNDER INSURANCE A

02:41:18.802 --> 02:41:20.604
HIGH BUILDING COSTS.

02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:22.939
BUT IS ALSO A TRAUMA THAT IS

02:41:23.006 --> 02:41:24.975
THAT VISITS PEOPLE IN THIS KIND

02:41:25.042 --> 02:41:26.109
OF SITUATION.

02:41:26.176 --> 02:41:28.011
AND THEY REMAIN TRAUMATIZED BY

02:41:28.078 --> 02:41:29.746
WITH THE EXPERIENCE THAT NIGHT

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:30.347
AND THEN IN THE MONTHS THAT

02:41:30.414 --> 02:41:32.249
FOLLOWED THAT IT'S PALPABLE WHEN

02:41:32.315 --> 02:41:33.316
YOU TALK TO THEM.

02:41:33.383 --> 02:41:34.451
IT REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT

02:41:34.518 --> 02:41:36.019
INTERFERES WITH THE FOCUS AND

02:41:36.086 --> 02:41:37.721
DECISIVENESS THAT'S NECESSARY TO

02:41:37.788 --> 02:41:39.523
MOVE FORWARD WITH A A REBUILDING

02:41:39.589 --> 02:41:41.658
PROJECT SO MY GUESS IS AROUND

02:41:41.725 --> 02:41:42.659
25% OF OUR NEIGHBORS WILL NEVER

02:41:42.726 --> 02:41:43.860
REBUILD.

02:41:43.927 --> 02:41:45.328
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FACE THE

02:41:45.395 --> 02:41:46.930
ADDITIONAL STRESSES AND DELAY

02:41:46.997 --> 02:41:48.865
THE LIKE THE DESIGN AND

02:41:48.932 --> 02:41:50.233
CONSTRUCTION PROCESS ENTAILS.

02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:51.768
IN MY POINT IN RAISING THESE

02:41:51.835 --> 02:41:54.071
ISSUES IS TO EMPHASIZE THE HUMAN

02:41:54.137 --> 02:41:55.839
TOLL THAT THESE WILDFIRES TAKE I

02:41:55.906 --> 02:41:57.274
KNOW THE THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:59.342
GALLAGHER IS VERY VERY FAMILIAR

02:41:59.409 --> 02:42:01.945
WITH THIS I'M SURE -- BUT IT'S

02:42:02.012 --> 02:42:03.513
MORE THAN STRUCTURES IT'S MORE

02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:05.148
THAN DOLLARS IT'S MORE THAN

02:42:05.215 --> 02:42:06.750
MATERIAL THINGS AND IT'S

02:42:06.817 --> 02:42:08.151
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY DO NEED

02:42:08.218 --> 02:42:08.985
TO KEEP IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR

02:42:09.052 --> 02:42:09.853
MINDS.

02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:11.321
AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE

02:42:11.388 --> 02:42:12.656
GOING TO REDUCE THESE HAZARDS

02:42:12.722 --> 02:42:15.459
AND REDUCE RISK IN THE FUTURE.

02:42:15.525 --> 02:42:16.526
IN WITH THIS IN MIND I'M OUT OF

02:42:16.593 --> 02:42:18.061
TOUCH ON AN ISSUE THAT YOU'VE

02:42:18.128 --> 02:42:19.563
ALREADY TOUCHED ON HERE.

02:42:19.629 --> 02:42:21.965
BUT IT'S REALLY A SHIFT THAT I

02:42:22.032 --> 02:42:23.500
BELIEVE IS NEEDED AND HOW WE

02:42:23.567 --> 02:42:25.702
PLAN FOR WILD FIRE HAZARDS.

02:42:25.769 --> 02:42:27.304
IN THE NEAR OUR COMMUNITIES IN

02:42:27.370 --> 02:42:28.772
ABOUT PLANNING FOR DEVELOPMENT

02:42:28.839 --> 02:42:31.808
GENERALLY IN WHILE FAR AREAS.

02:42:31.875 --> 02:42:33.410
SO IT'S A AS THE FOLKS FROM CAL

02:42:33.477 --> 02:42:34.945
FIRE INDICATED IT SHOULD BE

02:42:35.011 --> 02:42:36.279
PAINFULLY OBVIOUS TO ALL OF US

02:42:36.346 --> 02:42:37.848
NOW THAT WE LIVE.

02:42:37.914 --> 02:42:39.349
IN AN ENVIRONMENT MORE FOR FIRES

02:42:39.416 --> 02:42:41.551
AN ONION UNAVOIDABLE PART OF OUR

02:42:41.618 --> 02:42:42.686
LANDSCAPE.

02:42:42.752 --> 02:42:44.154
EVEN WITHOUT A SINGLE HUMAN

02:42:44.221 --> 02:42:46.056
STRUCTURED OUR STATE CALIFORNIA

02:42:46.123 --> 02:42:48.458
WOULD STILL HAVE WILDFIRES SOME

02:42:48.525 --> 02:42:49.226
OF THOSE FIRES WOULD BE VERY

02:42:49.292 --> 02:42:50.026
LARGE.

02:42:50.093 --> 02:42:52.162
IN THIS NATURAL PLANT LANDSCAPES

02:42:52.229 --> 02:42:53.029
DO.

02:42:53.096 --> 02:42:54.064
THE WILD LANDS IN CALIFORNIA

02:42:54.131 --> 02:42:55.899
HAVE ADAPTED TO THIS WILDFIRE

02:42:55.966 --> 02:42:58.101
REGIME AND NOW WE HAVE SCIENCE

02:42:58.168 --> 02:42:59.769
CALLED FIRE ECOLOGY.

02:42:59.836 --> 02:43:01.638
THE TELLS US THAT MANY OF CAL

02:43:01.705 --> 02:43:03.273
CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL COMMUNITIES

02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:05.775
ACTUALLY RELY ON REGULAR FIRES.

02:43:05.842 --> 02:43:07.144
TO MAINTAIN THEIR ECOLOGICAL

02:43:07.210 --> 02:43:08.578
HEALTH AND DIVERSITY.

02:43:08.645 --> 02:43:10.080
BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T LIVE IN A

02:43:10.147 --> 02:43:12.048
PRISTINE STATE OF NATURE ALREADY

02:43:12.115 --> 02:43:14.584
ABOUT A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS.

02:43:14.651 --> 02:43:16.253
LIVE AND WORK IN THE WILDLAND

02:43:16.319 --> 02:43:18.488
URBAN INTERFACE AREAS AND MORE

02:43:18.555 --> 02:43:20.123
PEOPLE ARE COMING ALL THE TIME.

02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:21.191
AND AS YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST

02:43:21.258 --> 02:43:22.759
CENTURY OR SO WHILE FAR

02:43:22.826 --> 02:43:24.127
MANAGEMENT OF THE UNITED STATES

02:43:24.194 --> 02:43:25.829
HAS BEEN BASED ON WILDFIRE

02:43:25.896 --> 02:43:27.564
PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION.

02:43:27.631 --> 02:43:30.033
AND WE NOW KNOW AS THE AGAINST

02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:31.434
THE FOLKS FROM CAL FIRE TOLD YOU.

02:43:31.501 --> 02:43:33.436
THE ONE RESULT OF THAT APPROACH

02:43:33.503 --> 02:43:35.405
IS A HUGE BUILD UP OF WILD LAND

02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:37.174
FUELS THE CONCERT CONTRIBUTES

02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:39.142
CONSIDERABLY TO THE DRAMATIC AND

02:43:39.209 --> 02:43:40.777
CATASTROPHIC FIRES.

02:43:40.844 --> 02:43:42.512
THAT WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY.

02:43:42.579 --> 02:43:44.214
WE'VE GOTTEN SO GOOD AT FIRE

02:43:44.281 --> 02:43:46.683
SUPPRESSION THOUGH THAT WE HAVE

02:43:46.750 --> 02:43:48.251
IT'S LED TO A CERTAIN HUBRIS ON

02:43:48.318 --> 02:43:49.853
THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE OF THINGS

02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:50.820
IN MY VIEW.

02:43:50.887 --> 02:43:51.988
THE SHARE OF OUR STATE'S

02:43:52.055 --> 02:43:55.192
POPULATION IN WE AREAS -- IT

02:43:55.258 --> 02:43:57.494
CONTINUES TO GROW EVEN NOW.

02:43:57.561 --> 02:43:58.828
AND HERE'S THE IS HERE IT'S

02:43:58.895 --> 02:44:00.363
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE

02:44:00.430 --> 02:44:02.032
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE

02:44:02.098 --> 02:44:03.633
INCLUDES FAR MORE THAN JUST THE

02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:06.203
VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY

02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:06.770
ZONES.

02:44:06.836 --> 02:44:08.705
MY OWN HOME FOR EXAMPLE WAS IN

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:10.340
AN AREA THAT WAS MAPPED BY CAL

02:44:10.407 --> 02:44:13.877
FIRE IS ONLY MODERATE -- FIRE

02:44:13.944 --> 02:44:14.911
HAZARD SECURITY.

02:44:14.978 --> 02:44:15.612
WE'VE DEVELOPED FIRE SAFE

02:44:15.679 --> 02:44:16.513
STANDARDS AND WE BUILDING CODES

02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:18.281
THAT ESSENTIALLY SAY GO AHEAD

02:44:18.348 --> 02:44:20.016
AND BUILD IN THESE AREAS WE CAN

02:44:20.083 --> 02:44:21.351
PROTECT YOU.

02:44:21.418 --> 02:44:22.886
AND I THINK THAT THE THE THE

02:44:22.953 --> 02:44:24.487
PUTTING THE LIE TO THAT IF YOU

02:44:24.554 --> 02:44:26.122
WILL IS SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US

02:44:26.189 --> 02:44:27.724
ARE REALIZING COLLECTIVELY HERE

02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:29.159
THE PAST COUPLE YEARS.

02:44:29.226 --> 02:44:30.760
AND AS WE'VE DONE THIS THOUGH AS

02:44:30.827 --> 02:44:32.229
THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS INCREASED

02:44:32.295 --> 02:44:33.763
OUT IN THESE WE WE AREAS.

02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:35.465
WE'VE ADDED LITERALLY ANOTHER

02:44:35.532 --> 02:44:37.901
MAJOR SOURCE OF FUEL TO THE FIRE.

02:44:37.968 --> 02:44:39.436
THE FIRE STORMS WE EXPERIENCE IN

02:44:39.502 --> 02:44:40.737
CINEMA COUNTY BUTTE COUNTY WERE

02:44:40.804 --> 02:44:42.339
EVERY BIT AS MUCH STRUCTURE

02:44:42.405 --> 02:44:44.341
FIRES AS THEY WERE WILD LAND

02:44:44.407 --> 02:44:45.175
FIRES.

02:44:45.242 --> 02:44:46.376
MEANING THAT THE STRUCTURES THAT

02:44:46.443 --> 02:44:49.479
WE HAD PUT IN THE PATH OF WILD

02:44:49.546 --> 02:44:50.280
LAND FIRES.

02:44:50.347 --> 02:44:51.314
ESSENTIALLY BECAME THE FUEL THAT

02:44:51.381 --> 02:44:53.016
RESULTED IN EVEN LARGER AND MORE

02:44:53.083 --> 02:44:56.119
DESTRUCTIVE FIRES. TO THE POINT

02:44:56.186 --> 02:44:59.789
THAT -- IN OUR AREA FOR EXAMPLE.

02:44:59.856 --> 02:45:01.424
FIRE SAFE STANDARDS AND WE

02:45:01.491 --> 02:45:02.726
BUILDING CODES OFFERED ONLY

02:45:02.792 --> 02:45:05.028
LIMITED PROTECTION FROM WIND

02:45:05.095 --> 02:45:06.596
DRIVEN FIRE STORMS THAT -- IN

02:45:06.663 --> 02:45:08.031
AREAS THAT WERE DEVELOPED AT

02:45:08.098 --> 02:45:09.366
SUBURBAN DENSITIES.

02:45:09.432 --> 02:45:10.900
SO THE SHIFT I'M TALKING ABOUT

02:45:10.967 --> 02:45:12.235
MEANS THAT INSTEAD OF PRETENDING

02:45:12.302 --> 02:45:13.503
THAT WE CAN KEEP BUILDING IN

02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:14.971
HAZARDOUS AREAS.

02:45:15.038 --> 02:45:16.473
AND ACTUALLY PROTECT OUR HOMES

02:45:16.539 --> 02:45:18.742
AND BUSINESSES AGAINST LITERAL

02:45:18.808 --> 02:45:19.909
FIRE STORMS.

02:45:19.976 --> 02:45:21.478
DRIVEN BY HIGH WINDS AND

02:45:21.544 --> 02:45:23.213
EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE WE

02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:24.748
NEED TO STOP MAKING THINGS WORSE

02:45:24.814 --> 02:45:27.150
BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF NEW

02:45:27.217 --> 02:45:28.351
DEVELOPMENT.

02:45:28.418 --> 02:45:30.553
THAT OCCURS IN THESE AREAS THIS

02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:31.288
STARTS WITH GOOD LAND USE

02:45:31.354 --> 02:45:32.055
PLANNING.

02:45:32.122 --> 02:45:33.423
THE REDUCES DENSITIES IN

02:45:33.490 --> 02:45:35.058
OUTLYING AREAS AND STRONGLY

02:45:35.125 --> 02:45:37.260
DISCOURAGES UP ZONING AND

02:45:37.327 --> 02:45:38.895
SUBDIVISIONS AND FIRE HAZARD

02:45:38.962 --> 02:45:39.729
AREAS.

02:45:39.796 --> 02:45:40.797
AND FOR THIS REASON APA

02:45:40.864 --> 02:45:42.399
CALIFORNIA'S VERY HAPPY TO BE

02:45:42.465 --> 02:45:45.635
SUPPORTING THIS YEAR -- EIGHT SB

02:45:45.702 --> 02:45:46.202
EIGHT ONE EIGHTY TWO WHICH I

02:45:46.269 --> 02:45:49.039
KNOW YOU YOUR COMMITTEES WILL BE

02:45:49.105 --> 02:45:49.606
HEARING AT SOME POINT IN THE

02:45:49.673 --> 02:45:49.939
NEAR FUTURE.

02:45:50.006 --> 02:45:51.107
THE OTHER REASON THE GOOD

02:45:51.174 --> 02:45:52.375
PLANNING IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS

02:45:52.442 --> 02:45:55.345
THE IS NEEDED IS TO ADDRESS THE

02:45:55.412 --> 02:45:56.980
OTHER SUBJECT OF YOUR HEARING

02:45:57.047 --> 02:45:58.782
TODAY HOUSING DELIVERY. FOR THE

02:45:58.848 --> 02:45:59.916
PAST COUPLE OF DECADES THE

02:45:59.983 --> 02:46:01.484
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS TAKEN

02:46:01.551 --> 02:46:03.386
A NUMBER OF STEPS. TO GUIDE LAND

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:05.255
USE DEVELOPMENT IN WAYS THAT

02:46:05.322 --> 02:46:06.556
MAKE OUR STATE MORE SUSTAINABLE

02:46:06.623 --> 02:46:09.092
I TALKING HERE ABOUT LAWS LIKE.

02:46:09.159 --> 02:46:10.760
THE SMART GROWTH PRINCIPLES OF

02:46:10.827 --> 02:46:12.495
AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN AND THE

02:46:12.562 --> 02:46:14.064
LINK BETWEEN THE LOCATION OF NEW

02:46:14.130 --> 02:46:15.165
LAND USES.

02:46:15.231 --> 02:46:17.734
AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS

02:46:17.801 --> 02:46:19.169
UNDER SB.

02:46:19.235 --> 02:46:19.736
THREE SEVENTY FIVE ALL THESE

02:46:19.803 --> 02:46:21.104
BILLS ALIGNED WITH THE COMMON

02:46:21.171 --> 02:46:23.173
THEME THAT IF CALIFORNIA IS

02:46:23.239 --> 02:46:24.574
GOING TO GROW MORE SUSTAINABLY

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:26.676
WE NEED TO ACTIVELY DISCOURAGE

02:46:26.743 --> 02:46:28.244
INCREASE ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT

02:46:28.311 --> 02:46:30.780
IN SOME AREAS AND DISCOURAGED IN

02:46:30.847 --> 02:46:31.648
OTHERS.

02:46:31.715 --> 02:46:32.949
IN MY HOME REGION THE BAY AREA

02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:34.584
GROWTH IN HOUSING ALLOCATIONS

02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:36.286
ARE ALREADY FOCUSED AS THEY

02:46:36.353 --> 02:46:38.021
SHOULD BE IN URBAN CORE AND JOB

02:46:38.088 --> 02:46:39.756
RICH AREAS AND AWAY FROM GREEN

02:46:39.823 --> 02:46:40.924
FIELD DEVELOPMENT IN

02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:43.960
AGRICULTURAL IN OUTLYING AREAS.

02:46:44.027 --> 02:46:44.861
SO WHAT IS THIS MEETING WILD

02:46:44.928 --> 02:46:46.796
FIRE HAZARD AREAS IT MEANS QUITE

02:46:46.863 --> 02:46:47.764
SIMPLY.

02:46:47.831 --> 02:46:49.499
THAT ADDING MORE FAR FLUNG RURAL

02:46:49.566 --> 02:46:51.501
SUBDIVISIONS IN OUTLYING WILD

02:46:51.568 --> 02:46:53.770
FIRE HAZARD AREAS IS NOT A

02:46:53.837 --> 02:46:55.305
SUSTAINABLE LAND USE PRACTICE.

02:46:55.372 --> 02:46:56.206
IT MEANS THAT CITIES AND

02:46:56.272 --> 02:46:57.807
COUNTIES WITH WE WE ARE IS THE

02:46:57.874 --> 02:46:59.342
TO FOCUS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN

02:46:59.409 --> 02:47:01.578
THE LEASE HAZARDOUS AREAS.

02:47:01.644 --> 02:47:03.113
EVEN IF IT MEANS INCREASING

02:47:03.179 --> 02:47:04.948
DENSITIES IN THOSE AREAS.

02:47:05.014 --> 02:47:06.716
AND THEY NEED TO INCLUDE ROBERT

02:47:06.783 --> 02:47:08.351
ROBUST FIRE PROTECTION IN

02:47:08.418 --> 02:47:09.719
MITIGATION MEASURES.

02:47:09.786 --> 02:47:11.087
IN APPROVING THOSE TWO

02:47:11.154 --> 02:47:12.622
DEVELOPMENTS AND ALL OF THAT

02:47:12.689 --> 02:47:13.923
TAKES GOOD PLANNING.

02:47:13.990 --> 02:47:15.291
EVERY COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S

02:47:15.358 --> 02:47:17.527
URBAN OR RURAL NEEDS TO MEET

02:47:17.594 --> 02:47:19.162
THEIR AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS

02:47:19.229 --> 02:47:20.930
AT STATE ROUTE LAW REQUIRES AND

02:47:20.997 --> 02:47:22.632
AS OUR COMMUNITY SO DESPERATELY

02:47:22.699 --> 02:47:24.634
NEEDS.

02:47:24.701 --> 02:47:25.802
BUT THEY NEED TO DO IT IN A

02:47:25.869 --> 02:47:27.070
SUSTAINABLE WAY.

02:47:27.137 --> 02:47:28.371
BUT COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE AN

02:47:28.438 --> 02:47:30.006
OBLIGATION TO APPROVE NEW

02:47:30.073 --> 02:47:31.875
UPSCALE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS OR

02:47:31.941 --> 02:47:32.842
RECREATION.

02:47:32.909 --> 02:47:34.811
OR RECREATIONAL OR SECOND HOMES

02:47:34.878 --> 02:47:36.679
SUBDIVISIONS IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD

02:47:36.746 --> 02:47:38.481
AREAS DEVELOPMENT THAT ONLY

02:47:38.548 --> 02:47:40.917
INCREASES HAZARDS FOR ALL OF US.

02:47:40.984 --> 02:47:41.985
THANK YOU A CONCLUDES MY

02:47:42.051 --> 02:47:43.219
TESTIMONY.

02:47:43.286 --> 02:47:46.623
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME IS

02:47:46.689 --> 02:47:46.823
SCARY.

02:47:46.890 --> 02:47:48.158
BEST TO SEE YOU.

02:47:48.224 --> 02:47:50.059
THANK YEAR CHAIRS -- AND MEMBERS

02:47:50.126 --> 02:47:52.362
OF TAKE COMMITTEES -- FOR ASKING

02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:53.730
ME HERE TO KIND OF SPEAK A

02:47:53.797 --> 02:47:54.464
LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE

02:47:54.531 --> 02:47:55.799
CHALLENGES THAT EMERGENCY

02:47:55.865 --> 02:47:58.134
MANAGEMENT HAS AT THE LOCAL

02:47:58.201 --> 02:47:59.402
LEVEL I HAVE.

02:47:59.469 --> 02:48:00.703
YOU HEARD THE PREVIOUS PANEL

02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:01.838
TALK ABOUT.

02:48:01.905 --> 02:48:05.175
ACRONYMS THAT NOBODY REMEMBERS --

02:48:05.241 --> 02:48:06.843
MAYBE EVEN ASKED FOR SOME OF

02:48:06.910 --> 02:48:08.645
THAT TESTIMONY IN WRITING SO

02:48:08.711 --> 02:48:10.313
THAT YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THAT.

02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:11.381
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE

02:48:11.448 --> 02:48:13.483
CHALLENGE OF TAKING EVERYTHING

02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:15.418
THAT COMES DOWN FROM THE FEDERAL

02:48:15.485 --> 02:48:17.887
OR STATE LEVEL AS EITHER A

02:48:17.954 --> 02:48:20.156
MANDATE OR A BEST PRACTICE OR

02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:21.624
TIED TO FUNDING AND MOST OF US

02:48:21.691 --> 02:48:22.992
WANT THAT FUNDING.

02:48:23.059 --> 02:48:25.762
WE NEED THAT MONEY TO DO THE

02:48:25.829 --> 02:48:27.397
WORK THAT WE HAVE THAT.

02:48:27.464 --> 02:48:29.566
GIVEN MY CHOICE. 1100% OF THE

02:48:29.632 --> 02:48:30.400
TIME I'LL TAKE ANY MONEY THAT

02:48:30.467 --> 02:48:31.367
COMES MY WAY AND PUT IT TO

02:48:31.434 --> 02:48:33.703
STAFFING BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HAVE.

02:48:33.770 --> 02:48:36.105
A LACK OF PERSONNEL SHE JUST

02:48:36.172 --> 02:48:38.241
SURELY TO GET THIS INFORMATION

02:48:38.308 --> 02:48:39.676
ACROSS TO THE PUBLIC.

02:48:39.742 --> 02:48:40.777
THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:48:40.844 --> 02:48:42.745
THE PROGRAMS THE PLANS HOW

02:48:42.812 --> 02:48:44.247
EVERYTHING INTERACTS WHAT WE

02:48:44.314 --> 02:48:46.950
NEED THEM TO KNOW IS SO COMPLEX.

02:48:47.016 --> 02:48:49.018
THAT SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE TO

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:50.520
KEEP GOING OVER.

02:48:50.587 --> 02:48:53.256
BASS LINE AFTER AGAIN AND AGAIN

02:48:53.323 --> 02:48:55.758
AND AGAIN IT'S VERY CHALLENGING

02:48:55.825 --> 02:48:57.026
FOR US AND REALLY THE MOST

02:48:57.093 --> 02:49:00.497
EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THAT IS IN

02:49:00.563 --> 02:49:03.166
PERSON -- I CAN SHARE THINGS ON

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:04.167
SOCIAL MEDIA I CAN PUSH OUT

02:49:04.234 --> 02:49:06.069
WEBSITE INFORMATION BUT NOTHING

02:49:06.135 --> 02:49:07.504
HEADS HOME MORE THAN STANDING IN

02:49:07.570 --> 02:49:09.172
FRONT OF THAT RESIDENT.

02:49:09.239 --> 02:49:12.509
AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME.

02:49:12.575 --> 02:49:14.611
SO I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO AND

02:49:14.677 --> 02:49:16.179
I'VE GIVEN YOU AN INFOGRAPHIC

02:49:16.246 --> 02:49:20.149
ABOUT THREE MAIN PLANNING --

02:49:20.216 --> 02:49:22.552
KIND OF OUR PLANS IF YOU WILL.

02:49:22.619 --> 02:49:23.586
AND PLANNING EFFORTS THAT WE

02:49:23.653 --> 02:49:25.989
PARTICIPATE IN THE FIRST ONE

02:49:26.055 --> 02:49:27.690
BEING THE GENERAL PLAN NOW

02:49:27.757 --> 02:49:30.159
OBVIOUSLY UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE

02:49:30.226 --> 02:49:32.428
AS SIX FIVE THREE HUNDRED AND WE

02:49:32.495 --> 02:49:34.564
HAVE A MANDATE IN OUR

02:49:34.631 --> 02:49:36.900
COMMUNITIES TO ADOPT A GENERAL

02:49:36.966 --> 02:49:37.901
PLAN.

02:49:37.967 --> 02:49:38.968
BUT IN MANY JURISDICTION GENERAL

02:49:39.035 --> 02:49:42.939
PLANS ARE NOT FREQUENTLY TOUCH

02:49:43.006 --> 02:49:45.508
OR REVISIONS.

02:49:45.575 --> 02:49:47.677
IN A WHOLE SOMETIMES ONLY PARTS

02:49:47.744 --> 02:49:49.178
IT'S BECAUSE OF ONE SPECIFIC

02:49:49.245 --> 02:49:50.146
MANDATE.

02:49:50.213 --> 02:49:51.447
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DOESN'T

02:49:51.514 --> 02:49:54.350
TYPICALLY CONTROL THE TIMELINE

02:49:54.417 --> 02:49:55.885
OR THE STATUS OF GENERAL PLAN

02:49:55.952 --> 02:49:57.086
UPDATE SO IT MAKES IT VERY

02:49:57.153 --> 02:49:59.322
CHALLENGING TO PUT SOMETHING IN

02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:01.758
THAT AT THAT LEVEL OF PLAN IN

02:50:01.824 --> 02:50:04.227
OUR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS.

02:50:04.294 --> 02:50:06.429
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- THE HAZARD

02:50:06.496 --> 02:50:08.998
MITIGATION PLAN THAT'S ONE BIT

02:50:09.065 --> 02:50:11.200
MY JURISDICTIONS SPECIFICALLY IS

02:50:11.267 --> 02:50:13.236
VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT TWO

02:50:13.303 --> 02:50:14.671
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE JUST

02:50:14.737 --> 02:50:16.506
WENT THROUGH OUR FIVE YEAR FEMA

02:50:16.573 --> 02:50:18.975
PLANNING REVISION CYCLE THAT IS

02:50:19.042 --> 02:50:20.276
A FIVE YEAR CYCLE.

02:50:20.343 --> 02:50:23.079
WHEN WE TIE THINGS TO THAT PLAN

02:50:23.146 --> 02:50:24.847
YOU HAVE THE PROPENSITY TO ONLY

02:50:24.914 --> 02:50:27.250
SEE THAT DONE IN FIVE YEARS TIME

02:50:27.317 --> 02:50:29.552
FROM TODAY IF THEY GET APPROVED

02:50:29.619 --> 02:50:31.187
BY SCHEME OF THIS YEAR?

02:50:31.254 --> 02:50:33.189
SO AGAIN ANOTHER LINK THE

02:50:33.256 --> 02:50:34.924
STANDARD IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET

02:50:34.991 --> 02:50:36.926
SOMETHING INTEGRATED BECAUSE WE

02:50:36.993 --> 02:50:38.561
HAVE TO HAVE ALL FIVE YEARS OF

02:50:38.628 --> 02:50:40.029
THAT TIME INCLUDES PUBLIC

02:50:40.096 --> 02:50:41.798
MEETINGS.

02:50:41.864 --> 02:50:44.634
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S IN

02:50:44.701 --> 02:50:46.035
200-017-2000 EIGHTEEN WE HAD

02:50:46.102 --> 02:50:48.271
ABOUT FOUR PUBLIC MEETING IS

02:50:48.338 --> 02:50:50.206
WHERE WE MESSAGED OUT TO

02:50:50.273 --> 02:50:52.775
EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTY. TO COME

02:50:52.842 --> 02:50:55.445
AND SHARE THEIR PERSPECTIVE WITH

02:50:55.511 --> 02:50:56.346
US.

02:50:56.412 --> 02:50:58.748
ABOUT MITIGATION WHAT PROJECTS

02:50:58.815 --> 02:51:00.617
WE SHOULD BE IT -- TACKING WITH

02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:02.518
THESE FUNDS YOU HEARD SOME

02:51:02.585 --> 02:51:04.220
PHENOMENAL.

02:51:04.287 --> 02:51:06.522
FUNDING AMOUNTS KIND OF THROWN

02:51:06.589 --> 02:51:08.224
OUT WITH THE LAST PANEL AND

02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:09.859
TELLING YOU THEY'RE SMALL WHEN

02:51:09.926 --> 02:51:10.994
THEY GET TO MY LEVEL THEY'RE

02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:12.261
HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WHEN THEY GET

02:51:12.328 --> 02:51:13.930
TO MY LEVEL.

02:51:13.997 --> 02:51:15.298
THEY'RE VERY HARD TO GET.

02:51:15.365 --> 02:51:16.966
SO IT'S NOT AN END ALL BE ALL

02:51:17.033 --> 02:51:18.534
SOLUTION FOR EMERGENCY

02:51:18.601 --> 02:51:20.003
MANAGEMENT WE'RE WE'RE VERY

02:51:20.069 --> 02:51:21.237
PROGRESSIVE ANY OTHER WE HAVE

02:51:21.304 --> 02:51:23.072
CLIMATE CHANGE IN OUR MITIGATION

02:51:23.139 --> 02:51:24.574
PLAN NOW THE ONLY.

02:51:24.641 --> 02:51:27.176
LEGAL STANDARD IN THERE IS TO

02:51:27.243 --> 02:51:28.811
HAVE THE NATURAL HAZARDS.

02:51:28.878 --> 02:51:30.013
NOT ANY OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL ARE

02:51:30.079 --> 02:51:33.216
MANMADE HAZARDS WHICH INCLUDES

02:51:33.282 --> 02:51:34.517
WILD FIRE.

02:51:34.584 --> 02:51:35.752
SO THAT MAKES IT SO THAT IN A

02:51:35.818 --> 02:51:36.686
LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

02:51:36.753 --> 02:51:38.554
AGENCY HAS TO BE PROGRESSIVE

02:51:38.621 --> 02:51:40.490
HOUSE TO GO OUT HAS TO TALK

02:51:40.556 --> 02:51:42.625
PEOPLE INTO INCLUDING MORE THAN

02:51:42.692 --> 02:51:45.094
WHAT'S MANDATED AN ALREADY VERY

02:51:45.161 --> 02:51:46.529
LONG TRYING CYCLE.

02:51:46.596 --> 02:51:49.632
THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF HANDS ON

02:51:49.699 --> 02:51:52.135
AND TOUCHING OF OUR COMMUNITY I

02:51:52.201 --> 02:51:53.069
CAN TELL YOU THIS PUBLIC

02:51:53.136 --> 02:51:55.371
MEETINGS WE HAD AN AVERAGE OF

02:51:55.438 --> 02:51:56.005
THREE PEOPLE SHOW UP TO EACH OF

02:51:56.072 --> 02:51:58.841
THEM. THREE OUT OF A COUNTY OF

02:51:58.908 --> 02:52:00.777
TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND

02:52:00.843 --> 02:52:02.111
OKAY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT

02:52:02.178 --> 02:52:04.013
THE CITY OF DAVIS CITY COUNCIL

02:52:04.080 --> 02:52:04.747
CHAMBERS.

02:52:04.814 --> 02:52:06.249
AT THE WINTERS PUBLIC SAFETY

02:52:06.315 --> 02:52:07.316
BUILDING THESE ARE NOT SMALL

02:52:07.383 --> 02:52:08.885
VENUES WERE PLANNING FOR MANY

02:52:08.951 --> 02:52:10.319
MANY PEOPLE TO COME WE WANT TO

02:52:10.386 --> 02:52:11.454
QUESTIONS.

02:52:11.521 --> 02:52:12.655
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST

02:52:12.722 --> 02:52:15.558
IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT.

02:52:15.625 --> 02:52:18.227
WHEN WE WE HAVE EIGHTEEN PAGES

02:52:18.294 --> 02:52:20.029
OF MITIGATION PROJECTS IN THE

02:52:20.096 --> 02:52:21.164
NEW YOLO COUNTY HAZARD

02:52:21.230 --> 02:52:22.532
MITIGATION PLAN?

02:52:22.598 --> 02:52:24.634
WE HAVE SOME THAT WE'VE ALREADY

02:52:24.701 --> 02:52:26.502
ACTUALLY APPLIED NOTICE OF

02:52:26.569 --> 02:52:27.937
INTENSE TO APPLY FOR MITIGATION

02:52:28.004 --> 02:52:29.839
FUNDS OUT OF MULTIPLE MEDICATION

02:52:29.906 --> 02:52:31.841
PATHWAYS PRE DISASTER MITIGATION --

02:52:31.908 --> 02:52:33.276
MITIGATION MONIES THAT OPEN UP

02:52:33.342 --> 02:52:36.079
AFTER A DISASTER HAPPENS ALL OF

02:52:36.145 --> 02:52:36.713
THOSE WE TRY TO MAKE USE OF ALL

02:52:36.779 --> 02:52:37.313
OF THEM.

02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:38.281
SOME OF THEM WE'VE BEEN TURNED

02:52:38.347 --> 02:52:40.683
DOWN FOUR AND FIVE TIMES IN JUST

02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:41.984

02:52:44.187 --> 02:52:45.021
AWARDED.

02:52:45.088 --> 02:52:46.622
SO IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING TO

02:52:46.689 --> 02:52:48.024
GET THOSE GRANTS EVEN THE MONEY

02:52:48.091 --> 02:52:49.826
IS THERE AND IT'S THERE FOR VERY

02:52:49.892 --> 02:52:51.527
GOOD REASON AND WE ALL WANTED IT

IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE YOU'RE

02:52:53.396 --> 02:52:54.931
COMPETING AGAINST.

02:52:54.997 --> 02:52:57.133
EVERYONE OF THE OTHER FIFTY

02:52:57.200 --> 02:52:58.367

OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR THESE

02:53:09.078 --> 02:53:10.480
GRANTS.

02:53:10.546 --> 02:53:13.382
AND IF THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL

02:53:13.449 --> 02:53:16.953
BASES TO OUTSOURCE THEIR GRANT

02:53:17.019 --> 02:53:18.588
WRITING AND THINGS LIKE THAT

02:53:18.654 --> 02:53:20.056
QUITE FREQUENTLY THEY WILL BEAT

02:53:20.123 --> 02:53:21.791
US OUT IF WE DO IT IN HOUSE.

02:53:21.858 --> 02:53:23.226
AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FACT

02:53:23.292 --> 02:53:25.328
WE REALLY REALLY WANT TO THAT

02:53:25.394 --> 02:53:27.497
MONEY WHEN WE TRAVEL TO THE VERY

THAT'S ONE OF MY INDUSTRY

02:53:33.469 --> 02:53:36.439
FREQUENTLY TOUCHES ALL THE TIME --

02:53:36.506 --> 02:53:37.507
IF WE'RE FOLLOWING THE

02:53:37.573 --> 02:53:39.509

02:55:36.392 --> 02:55:37.593
PLANNING THAT WERE ROLLING OUT

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:38.561
RIGHT NOW.

02:55:38.628 --> 02:55:39.662
LOTS OF THINGS WE'VE NEVER EVEN

02:55:39.729 --> 02:55:41.864
THOUGHT OF AND SOME OF THEM ARE

02:55:41.931 --> 02:55:44.000
SO SIMPLE THAT WE WONDER WHY WE

02:55:44.066 --> 02:55:45.134
DIDN'T THINK OF THEM I DON'T

02:55:45.201 --> 02:55:46.402
KNOW START A COMMUNITY MEETING

02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:47.603
THE OTHER NIGHT.

02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:48.905
A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAME UP

02:55:48.971 --> 02:55:50.039
TO ME AND SAID.

02:55:50.106 --> 02:55:52.475
WELL I HAVE LARGE ANIMALS OUR

02:55:52.541 --> 02:55:54.210
FORCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT I

02:55:54.277 --> 02:55:55.778
NEED A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO

02:55:55.845 --> 02:55:57.179
KNOW WHERE TO TAKE THEM AND WHEN

02:55:57.246 --> 02:55:58.648
WE SAY WE PUT IT OUT ON THE

02:55:58.714 --> 02:56:00.049
SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNEL WE PUT IT

02:56:00.116 --> 02:56:01.851
ON THIS WEBSITE WE BLASTED OUT

02:56:01.918 --> 02:56:02.518
THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

02:56:02.585 --> 02:56:04.387
HE SAYS I DON'T DO SOCIAL MEDIA

02:56:04.453 --> 02:56:05.955
I WANT A PHONE AND YOUR PHONE

02:56:06.022 --> 02:56:07.356
NUMBER TO CALL WHEN WE WERE UP

02:56:07.423 --> 02:56:08.724
IN THE CAPE PAY VALLEY.

02:56:08.791 --> 02:56:10.559
I NEED A PRINT VERSION OF THIS

02:56:10.626 --> 02:56:12.561
MAP I DON'T USE A COMPUTER

02:56:12.628 --> 02:56:14.297
THERE'S NO CELL SIGNAL UP HERE.

02:56:14.363 --> 02:56:16.265
I CAN'T USE MASS NOTIFICATION IN

02:56:16.332 --> 02:56:19.402
SYSTEM IN THE CAPE PAY VALLEY.

02:56:19.468 --> 02:56:19.902
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:21.203
CHALLENGES THAT LOCAL EMERGENCY

02:56:21.270 --> 02:56:22.838
MANAGERS HAVE CONNECTING THE

02:56:22.905 --> 02:56:25.474
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY WILD LAND.

02:56:25.541 --> 02:56:27.243
PLANNING PROCESS TO THE URBAN

02:56:27.310 --> 02:56:28.511
FORESTRY.

02:56:28.577 --> 02:56:30.713
PLANS THAT ARE NOW INCLUDING

02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:33.416
WILDFIRE INFORMATION IN THEM.

02:56:33.482 --> 02:56:34.283
COURTESY OF OTHER CAL FIRE

02:56:34.350 --> 02:56:35.685
GRANTS ARE ALL GREAT PLANNING

02:56:35.751 --> 02:56:36.686
PROCESS SEES.

02:56:36.752 --> 02:56:38.955
IF WE HAVE THREE TO FOUR URBAN

02:56:39.021 --> 02:56:40.923
FORESTRY PLANS AND THEN FOR

02:56:40.990 --> 02:56:43.225
COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE PROTECTION

02:56:43.292 --> 02:56:44.126
PLANS.

02:56:44.193 --> 02:56:46.062
MY INDUSTRY HAS TO FIGURE OUT

02:56:46.128 --> 02:56:47.596
HOW TO MAKE ALL THOSE PLANS WORK

02:56:47.663 --> 02:56:48.965
TOGETHER AND LET THE ENTIRE

02:56:49.031 --> 02:56:50.533
COMMUNITY KNOW WHERE THE

02:56:50.599 --> 02:56:51.600
CROSSOVERS ARE.

02:56:51.667 --> 02:56:53.102
IS WE'RE NOT JUST PLANNING FOR

02:56:53.169 --> 02:56:54.603
ONE TINY LITTLE CIRCLE OF OUR

02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:57.173
JURISDICTIONS THOSE HAZARDS.

02:56:57.239 --> 02:56:59.008
IF IT'S WATER IT FLOWS OUTSIDE

02:56:59.075 --> 02:57:00.443
OF THE AREA IF IT'S FIRE IT

02:57:00.509 --> 02:57:01.877
BURNS WE'VE HAD HISTORICAL FIRES

02:57:01.944 --> 02:57:02.878
INYO COUNTY.

02:57:02.945 --> 02:57:04.780
THAT OUTPACE THE EMERGENCY

02:57:04.847 --> 02:57:06.949
RESPONSE VEHICLES ON I FIVE

02:57:07.016 --> 02:57:08.651
BECAUSE OF THE WINDS BLOWING

02:57:08.718 --> 02:57:10.820
THEM THAT FAST. FOUR OUT OF FOUR

02:57:10.886 --> 02:57:11.954
YEARS AND I'VE BEEN EMERGENCY

02:57:12.021 --> 02:57:15.591
MANAGER -- WE'VE HAD OUR ANNUAL

02:57:15.658 --> 02:57:17.326
FIRE OUTSIDE OF WINTERS MOST

02:57:17.393 --> 02:57:18.694
PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER OUR FIRE

02:57:18.761 --> 02:57:22.565
OUR NINETY THOUSAND SQUARE ACRE

02:57:22.631 --> 02:57:23.399
FIRE LAST YEAR.

02:57:23.466 --> 02:57:24.300
BECAUSE BECAUSE NOBODY DIED AND

02:57:24.367 --> 02:57:24.867
NOBODY REALLY LOST A PRIMARY

02:57:24.934 --> 02:57:27.003
RESIDENCE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

02:57:27.069 --> 02:57:28.471
THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A WHAT THEY

02:57:28.537 --> 02:57:30.639
CALL A TYPE ONE LEVEL INCIDENT

02:57:30.706 --> 02:57:32.408
FOUR OUT OF FOUR YEARS IN YOLO

02:57:32.475 --> 02:57:33.909
COUNTY AND IT CROSSED.

02:57:33.976 --> 02:57:37.313
INTO NAPA AND SOLANO COUNTIES IN

02:57:37.380 --> 02:57:38.681
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE

02:57:38.748 --> 02:57:40.383
SO EMERGENCY MANAGERS FROM THREE

02:57:40.449 --> 02:57:42.084
COUNTIES HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

02:57:42.151 --> 02:57:43.953
TO MAKE SURE OUR PLANS TO JIVE

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:46.188
LOCKED TOGETHER AND WILL WORK

02:57:46.255 --> 02:57:48.024
TOGETHER ESPECIALLY FOR PUSHING

02:57:48.090 --> 02:57:49.925
OUR POPULATION INTO.

02:57:49.992 --> 02:57:51.494
THE NEIGHBORING COUNTY.

02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:52.995
SO THERE THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF

02:57:53.062 --> 02:57:54.530
THE CHALLENGES I CAN LIST THEM

02:57:54.597 --> 02:57:56.899
FOR DAYS IT'S REALLY THAT

02:57:56.966 --> 02:57:58.267
INHERENT.

02:57:58.334 --> 02:57:59.969
THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON WE HAVE

02:58:00.036 --> 02:58:02.038
DIFFICULTY GETTING THE PUBLIC TO

02:58:02.104 --> 02:58:03.939

02:58:04.006 --> 02:58:07.076
CHALLENGING -- PLANNING.

02:58:07.143 --> 02:58:08.978

02:58:09.045 --> 02:58:11.047

02:58:16.318 --> 02:58:17.720
MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A KIT.

02:58:17.787 --> 02:58:18.988
THAT THEY ARE INFORMED THAT THEY

02:58:19.055 --> 02:58:20.289

OF THE STATE TO THE LOCAL LEVER

03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:06.348
TO HELP US OUT SO I I WANTED TO

03:02:06.415 --> 03:02:09.818
SINGLE THEM OUT -- YOU KNOW --

03:02:09.885 --> 03:02:11.654
THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY I'M

03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:13.022
GONNA GIVE YOU A FEW POINTS ON

03:02:13.088 --> 03:02:14.156
AND WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING THAT

03:02:14.223 --> 03:02:16.125
MIGHT GIVE YOU THE FLAVOR OF IT

03:02:16.191 --> 03:02:17.192
FROM WORKERS AND SOMEWHAT

03:02:17.259 --> 03:02:19.295
STACCATO FASHION HERE -- NO

03:02:19.361 --> 03:02:21.130
POINTS I WANT TO MAKE -- ONE THE

03:02:21.196 --> 03:02:23.632
MAGNITUDE OF THIS DISASTER IS AT

03:02:23.699 --> 03:02:25.334
THE ROOT OF EVERYONE OF OUR

03:02:25.401 --> 03:02:27.736
REBUILDING PROBLEMS OR EIGHTEEN

03:02:27.803 --> 03:02:28.837
MONTHS INTO THIS SO WE'RE LESS

03:02:28.904 --> 03:02:31.440
THAN 20% FAR LESS THAN 20%

03:02:31.507 --> 03:02:32.875
REBUILD WITH PEOPLE IN.

03:02:32.941 --> 03:02:35.044
A BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE FIVE

03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:37.579
YEAR MARK WILL PROBABLY HAVE 60%

03:02:37.646 --> 03:02:40.883
PLUS OF HOMES TO REBUILD OR

03:02:40.949 --> 03:02:42.117
BUILT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT.

03:02:42.184 --> 03:02:43.085
TO FEMA TOLD ME WHEN I WAS

03:02:43.152 --> 03:02:44.887
WORKING AT THE FEMA CENTER RIGHT

03:02:44.953 --> 03:02:46.955
AFTER THE FIRES ON A STE

03:02:47.022 --> 03:02:54.530
NATIONWIDE ON ANY A NATIONAL

03:02:54.596 --> 03:02:56.999
DISASTER MAJOR DISASTER. 435% OF

03:02:57.066 --> 03:02:57.700
PEOPLE DON'T REBUILD FOR A

03:02:57.766 --> 03:02:58.300
VARIETY OF REASONS WELL I'VE

03:02:58.367 --> 03:02:58.934
TALKED TO HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

03:02:59.001 --> 03:02:59.468
OF BUILDERS AND LITERALLY

03:02:59.535 --> 03:03:00.536
THOUSANDS OF FIRE VICTIMS IN

03:03:00.602 --> 03:03:01.770
MEETINGS AT NIGHTS AND ON

03:03:01.837 --> 03:03:02.538
WEEKENDS.

03:03:02.604 --> 03:03:03.672
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

03:03:03.739 --> 03:03:05.808
HELP THEM AND I'M GOING TO GUESS

03:03:05.874 --> 03:03:08.077
THAT 40% OF OUR PEOPLE PROBABLY

03:03:08.143 --> 03:03:09.945
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS ARE NOT

03:03:10.012 --> 03:03:11.013
GOING TO REBUILD.

03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:12.614
AND THE STATE REALLY NEED

03:03:12.681 --> 03:03:15.584
UNDERSTAND OF HOUSEHOLDS SERIES

03:03:15.651 --> 03:03:16.251
OF AN ISSUE THIS IS FOR A

03:03:16.318 --> 03:03:18.487
COMMUNITY TO LOSE THAT MANY

03:03:18.554 --> 03:03:20.489
PEOPLE -- THE SANTA ROSA JUNIOR

03:03:20.556 --> 03:03:22.157
COLLEGE A CLOSE FOR TWO WEEKS

03:03:22.224 --> 03:03:25.394
AFTER THE FIRES -- IN OCTOBER

03:03:25.461 --> 03:03:26.028
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN THEY OPEN

03:03:26.095 --> 03:03:28.230
THEY WERE A THOUSAND STUDENT

03:03:28.297 --> 03:03:29.898
SHORT WHO WOULD DISAPPEAR -- THE

03:03:29.965 --> 03:03:31.767
CENTER OF THE CITY SCHOOLS LAW

03:03:31.834 --> 03:03:33.369
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY STUDENTS

03:03:33.435 --> 03:03:35.070
WHO DID NOT COME BACK TO CLASS

03:03:35.137 --> 03:03:36.505
AND THE TOLL THAT TAKES ON THE

03:03:36.572 --> 03:03:37.973
COMMUNITY IS STANDING.

03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:39.808
UP FOR BUILDERS OF THE MAGNITUDE

03:03:39.875 --> 03:03:41.610
OF THIS PROBLEM -- I NEED TO

03:03:41.677 --> 03:03:42.711
GIVE YOU A FACTOID THERE WERE

03:03:42.778 --> 03:03:44.747
MORE IN IN THE FIRE IF WE

03:03:44.813 --> 03:03:46.715
EXPERIENCE THERE WERE MORE HOMES

03:03:46.782 --> 03:03:49.151
AND BUSINESSES DESTROYED THEN

03:03:49.218 --> 03:03:51.687
THERE ARE LICENSED CONTRACTORS.

03:03:51.754 --> 03:03:53.589
SO IF YOU WONDER WHY WILL ALWAYS

03:03:53.655 --> 03:03:55.991
TAKE OR IN MY MIND HALF A DECADE

03:03:56.058 --> 03:03:57.259
TO A DECADE FOR US TO LOOK

03:03:57.326 --> 03:03:59.995
ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT WE LOOK LIKE

03:04:00.062 --> 03:04:01.497
BEFORE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY

03:04:01.563 --> 03:04:03.198
NOT THE CONTRACTORS AND THEY

03:04:03.265 --> 03:04:04.666
DON'T HAVE THE WORKERS.

03:04:04.733 --> 03:04:05.901
THE THE IT'S CALLED GREAT

03:04:05.968 --> 03:04:08.504
PROBLEMS I WILL GIVE A ALSO

03:04:08.570 --> 03:04:09.838
CREDIT TO THE CONTRACTORS STATE

03:04:09.905 --> 03:04:12.107
LICENSE BOARD -- THEY HAVE BEEN

03:04:12.174 --> 03:04:14.343
VERY HELPFUL IN ACCELERATING

03:04:14.410 --> 03:04:16.879
TRAINING FOR NEW CONTRACTORS THE

03:04:16.945 --> 03:04:18.947
LICENSING OF NEW CONTRACTOR TO

03:04:19.014 --> 03:04:21.583
GET THEM -- ELIGIBLE TO BE DOING

03:04:21.650 --> 03:04:23.652
THE WORK BECAUSE WE NEED THEM --

03:04:23.719 --> 03:04:26.388
ON A REALLY BADLY AND THEY

03:04:26.455 --> 03:04:28.857
THEY'VE BEEN A GREAT HELP ON THE

03:04:28.924 --> 03:04:30.759
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WAS BUSY

03:04:30.826 --> 03:04:32.327
BEFORE THE FIRE SO THEIR BODY

03:04:32.394 --> 03:04:35.264
UNDERSTANDS EVERYONE WAS BUSY.

03:04:35.330 --> 03:04:37.065
DURING A RECESSION WELL

03:04:37.132 --> 03:04:38.767
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY LOST HALF

03:04:38.834 --> 03:04:40.269
OF ITS PAYROLL HALF OF

03:04:40.335 --> 03:04:42.304
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WERE NO

03:04:42.371 --> 03:04:44.072
LONGER CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AT

03:04:44.139 --> 03:04:45.407
THE END OF THE RECESSION THEY

03:04:45.474 --> 03:04:47.242
WENT ON TO DO OTHER THINGS SO WE

03:04:47.309 --> 03:04:52.214
WERE STRAPPED.

03:04:52.281 --> 03:04:53.849
AND IT HAS CAUSED GREAT DELAYS

03:04:53.916 --> 03:04:55.184
ON OUR PART NOT BECAUSE THEY

03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:55.784
DON'T WANT TO BUILD BUT THEY

03:04:55.851 --> 03:04:56.819
CONTRACTORS HAVE PEOPLE LINED UP

03:04:56.885 --> 03:04:57.386
WHO WANT TO GET THEIR HOMES

03:04:57.453 --> 03:04:58.187
BUILT.

03:04:58.253 --> 03:04:59.621
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE WORKERS TO

03:04:59.688 --> 03:05:01.490
ACCOMMODATE THEM POINT NUMBER

03:05:01.557 --> 03:05:02.958
TWO BESIDES A SHORTAGE OF

NEAR ENOUGH WORKERS THE

03:05:08.197 --> 03:05:09.898
CONSTRUCTION WORKER YOU SHORTAGE

03:05:09.965 --> 03:05:11.667
THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT IS VERY

03:05:11.733 --> 03:05:13.602
RELIGIOUS NON MANUFACTURED AT

03:05:13.669 --> 03:05:16.038
ALL WE LOST SO MANY OF THEM

03:05:16.104 --> 03:05:17.206
DURING THE RECESSION.

03:05:17.272 --> 03:05:19.141
WE'RE TRYING TO REGENERATE

03:05:19.208 --> 03:05:21.410

03:06:06.989 --> 03:06:08.457
BUILDERS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

03:06:08.524 --> 03:06:10.225
OF THEM THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET

03:06:10.292 --> 03:06:11.960
NEW WORKERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO

03:06:12.027 --> 03:06:14.396

THE MARKET PLACE.

03:06:16.932 --> 03:06:18.834
UNDER THAN FIFTY POTENTIALLY

03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:20.736
SHARP YOUNG NEW WORKERS WHO ARE

03:06:20.802 --> 03:06:23.372
PHENOMENAL A READY TO GO SO WE

CAN TELL YOU IS A BY ANOTHER

03:06:26.341 --> 03:06:27.042
POINT.

03:06:27.109 --> 03:06:29.378
WHAT WE LEARNED IS A PROJECT OF

03:06:29.444 --> 03:06:30.979
A BUILDING PROJECT LIKE IS

03:06:31.046 --> 03:06:32.614
HAPPENING IN THE NORTH BAY

03:06:32.681 --> 03:06:34.816
DOESN'T FIT A BUILDER'S NORMAL

03:06:34.883 --> 03:06:35.784
MODEL?

03:06:35.851 --> 03:06:37.252
YET LET ME EXPLAIN THAT A

03:06:37.319 --> 03:06:39.454
BUILDER'S HIRED BY A DEVELOPER

03:06:39.521 --> 03:06:41.924
THE DEVELOPER HAS TEN ACRES --

03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:43.725
TWENTY ACRES THEY WANNA BUILD A

03:06:43.792 --> 03:06:46.094
DEVELOPMENT OF A HUNDRED FIFTY

03:06:46.161 --> 03:06:47.462
HOMES SO THEY CONTROLLED

03:06:47.529 --> 03:06:54.503
ENVIRONMENT THEY THEY BY THE

03:06:54.570 --> 03:06:55.437
LAND THEY PUT IN THE

03:06:55.504 --> 03:06:56.805
INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDERS BUILD A

03:06:56.872 --> 03:06:57.940
HOMES THEY MARKET THEM THEY SELL

03:06:58.006 --> 03:06:58.574
WOMAN THEY LEAVE.

03:06:58.640 --> 03:06:59.708
THIS DOESN'T FIT IN PARADISE OR

03:06:59.775 --> 03:07:00.842
IN OUR AREA ANY BUILDING PROJECT

03:07:00.909 --> 03:07:01.944
MODEL THAT ANY OF THE PEOPLE I

03:07:02.010 --> 03:07:03.645
REPRESENT WORK WITH HAS EVER

03:07:03.712 --> 03:07:06.448
EXPERIENCED THEY NOW HAVE FIVE

03:07:06.515 --> 03:07:07.849
THOUSAND DIFFERENT DEVELOPERS.

03:07:07.916 --> 03:07:09.618
AND THEY'RE NOT USED TO BUILDING

03:07:09.685 --> 03:07:10.953
A HOME OVER THERE THEN MOVE

03:07:11.019 --> 03:07:12.588
THEIR CREW BILL HOME OVER THERE

03:07:12.654 --> 03:07:14.289
THERE THERE AND THERE IT IS

03:07:14.356 --> 03:07:15.557
THROWN US FOR A LOOP.

03:07:15.624 --> 03:07:17.626
AND COFFEE PARK THIRTEEN HUNDRED

03:07:17.693 --> 03:07:18.961
HOMES WERE LOST THESE ARE THE

03:07:19.027 --> 03:07:20.963
EASY BUILD SIX THOUSAND SQUARE

03:07:21.029 --> 03:07:23.465
FOOT LOTS OF WITH -- THAT ARE

03:07:23.532 --> 03:07:25.801
FLAT EASIER TO BUILD ON AND

03:07:25.867 --> 03:07:27.603
THERE AREN'T ANY GIVEN TIME A

03:07:27.669 --> 03:07:28.537
HUNDRED OR MORE DIFFERENT

03:07:28.604 --> 03:07:31.373
CONTRACTORS AND WORKERS ROAMING

03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:33.375
AROUND THE STREETS AND AND

03:07:33.442 --> 03:07:35.611
TRAFFIC CLOGGING UP WITH TRUCKS.

03:07:35.677 --> 03:07:37.512
THE COORDINATION ANYTHING THE

03:07:37.579 --> 03:07:39.314
STATE CAN DO TO HELP A

03:07:39.381 --> 03:07:40.816
COORDINATE THINGS LIKE HIS AND

03:07:40.882 --> 03:07:42.751
IT'S PROBABLY MORE LOCAL BUT BE

03:07:42.818 --> 03:07:44.553
AWARE OF THE SERIOUS PROBLEM

03:07:44.620 --> 03:07:46.088
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP IN

03:07:46.154 --> 03:07:47.956
AN AREA THAT'S ENTIRELY.

03:07:48.023 --> 03:07:50.225
DIFFERENT THAN A MAJOR PROJECT

03:07:50.292 --> 03:07:52.694
MY LAST COUPLE POINTS BEST THING

03:07:52.761 --> 03:07:53.362
FOR HOME BUILDERS IN THE

03:13:14.015 --> 03:13:15.784
POSITIVE NEWS FOR THE COMMUNITY --

03:13:15.850 --> 03:13:18.753
STILL LOTS OF WORK TO DO

03:13:18.820 --> 03:13:21.222
TRANSBAIKALIA NEXT TOUCH ON A

03:13:21.289 --> 03:13:22.857
LITTLE BIT IS SOME OF THE THINGS

03:13:22.924 --> 03:13:24.392
THAT WE HAVE SEEN AS FAR AS

03:13:24.459 --> 03:13:25.260
CHALLENGES GO TO HAVEN'T

03:13:25.327 --> 03:13:26.795
DISCUSSED YET HERE TODAY THAT I

03:13:26.861 --> 03:13:27.862
KNOW SOMEONE GALLAGHER IS VERY

03:13:27.929 --> 03:13:29.297
VERY WELL AWARE OF BUT I THINK

03:13:29.364 --> 03:13:30.098
IT SHOULD BE ON EVERYONE'S.

03:13:30.165 --> 03:13:31.800
MIND -- FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

03:13:31.866 --> 03:13:33.568
IMPACTED IN A WAY SIMILAR TO THE

03:13:33.635 --> 03:13:35.370
WAY THAT -- YOU COUNTY WAS

03:13:35.437 --> 03:13:37.172
IMPACTED.

03:13:37.238 --> 03:13:37.639
THERE'S THREE OR FOUR

03:13:37.706 --> 03:13:38.106
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES.

03:13:38.173 --> 03:13:38.974
BEYOND HOUSING HOUSING CERTAINLY

03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:40.408
IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE BOTH

03:13:40.475 --> 03:13:42.410
INFORMALITY IN IN PERMANENT

03:13:42.477 --> 03:13:43.278
HOUSING.

03:13:43.345 --> 03:13:44.346
COUPLE OF THINGS RIGHT NOW THAT

03:13:44.412 --> 03:13:45.714
WE REALLY ARE DOING WITH THIS IS

03:13:45.780 --> 03:13:46.514
A TREES.

03:13:46.581 --> 03:13:48.016
NO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE

03:13:48.083 --> 03:13:53.488
A COMMUNITY THAT IS NOW --

03:13:53.555 --> 03:13:54.856
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT NEED

03:13:54.923 --> 03:13:56.524
TO NEED SOME PROCESS A MECHANISM

03:13:56.591 --> 03:13:58.126
TO BE REMOVED.

03:13:58.193 --> 03:13:59.160
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S DIFFERENT

03:13:59.227 --> 03:14:00.261
CATEGORIES THE TREES WE HAVE

03:14:00.328 --> 03:14:01.329
TREES THAT ARE ON PUBLIC RIGHT

03:14:01.396 --> 03:14:03.131
AWAY WE HAVE A GOOD PROCESS TO

03:14:03.198 --> 03:14:04.065
DEAL WITH THOSE PUBLIC TRIP

03:14:04.132 --> 03:14:05.600
PUBLICLY OWNED MAINTAIN TREES

03:14:05.667 --> 03:14:07.235
BUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND TREES

03:14:07.302 --> 03:14:08.436
ON PRIVATE PROPERTY THE IMPACT

03:14:08.503 --> 03:14:09.571
RIGHT AWAY.

03:14:09.637 --> 03:14:11.439
COULD POSSIBLY IMPEDE AND FALL

03:14:11.506 --> 03:14:13.375
ON A NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY --

03:14:13.441 --> 03:14:14.743
SOLUTIONS JUST OUR WORD THERE'S

03:14:14.809 --> 03:14:16.378
NOT A CLEAR SOLUTION FOR THAT

03:14:16.444 --> 03:14:17.746
RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE WORKING

03:14:17.812 --> 03:14:19.347
DILIGENTLY ON THAT TRYING TO

03:14:19.414 --> 03:14:20.482
TRYING TO RESOLVE THAT SO THAT'S

03:14:20.548 --> 03:14:21.816
THAT'S ONE ISSUE I THINK SHOULD

03:14:21.883 --> 03:14:23.351
BE ON EVERYONE'S MIND. FOR FOR

03:14:23.418 --> 03:14:26.054
FUTURE POTENTIAL DISASTERS.

03:14:26.121 --> 03:14:29.457
ALSO ROADS -- WHEN YOU HAVE SO

03:14:29.524 --> 03:14:29.924
MUCH?

03:14:29.991 --> 03:14:31.192
CONSTRUCTION AND HEAVY TRUCKS

03:14:31.259 --> 03:14:33.461
GOING ON ROADS MANY OF OUR ROADS

03:14:33.528 --> 03:14:35.597
ARE JUST SIMPLY DETERIORATING ON

03:14:35.663 --> 03:14:36.965
THEIRS AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

03:14:37.032 --> 03:14:40.468
KEEP UP THEY WEREN'T -- I WANTED

03:14:40.535 --> 03:14:41.836
WERE DESIGNED TO HAVE HAVE YOU

03:14:41.903 --> 03:14:42.470
THOUGHT THEY WERE DESIGNED HAVE

03:14:42.537 --> 03:14:44.205
HEAVY TRUCK ON THEM BUT PROBABLY

03:14:44.272 --> 03:14:45.573
NOT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:47.609
TRUCKS A DAY -- THE WEAR AND

03:14:47.675 --> 03:14:48.943
TEAR INTO THESE ROADS ARE IS

03:14:49.010 --> 03:14:50.678
TREMENDOUS AND ON I KNOW WE'VE

03:14:50.745 --> 03:14:51.579
WRITTEN SOME LETTERS AND WE

03:14:51.646 --> 03:14:53.348
NEEDS WE NEED SOME SUPPORT HERE

03:14:53.415 --> 03:14:55.383
BECAUSE ONE ACCESS ROAD WHERE

03:14:55.450 --> 03:14:57.085
ARE LANDFILLS AT RIGHT NOW IS

03:14:57.152 --> 03:14:59.621
LITERALLY -- ITS NEW ROAD GOING

03:14:59.687 --> 03:15:01.156
UP BUT FROM NINETY NINE UP TO

03:15:01.222 --> 03:15:02.724
PARADISE IT IS THERE'S SPOTS

03:15:02.791 --> 03:15:04.793
WHERE IT'S ALMOST TRINITY GRAVEL

03:15:04.859 --> 03:15:06.394
SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY BAD.

03:15:06.461 --> 03:15:07.829
THE WATER SITUATION I KNOW IS

03:15:07.896 --> 03:15:10.031
VERY WELL KNOWN BOTH IN PARADISE

03:15:10.098 --> 03:15:11.933
IN IN THE IN A CORPORATE AREA --

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:12.734
CERTAINLY THAT'S GOING TO BE AN

03:15:12.801 --> 03:15:14.335
ISSUE THAT IS HIGH ON OUR

03:15:14.402 --> 03:15:15.170
PRIORITY LIST TO MAKE SURE WE

03:15:15.236 --> 03:15:17.405
CAN -- HAVE WATER SYSTEMS

03:15:17.472 --> 03:15:19.140
PROVIDING CLEAN WATER TO OUR

03:15:19.207 --> 03:15:20.041
RESIDENTS BECAUSE TO BE A KEY

03:15:20.108 --> 03:15:22.043
AND CRITICAL COMPONENT BEFORE

03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:23.845
THE COMMUNITIES TRULY BEGAN. TO

03:15:23.912 --> 03:15:25.814
REBUILD SO THOSE ARE A FEW

03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:27.449
THINGS BEYOND JUST THE THE

03:15:27.515 --> 03:15:29.284
ENTRANT HOUSING IN THE IN THE

03:15:29.350 --> 03:15:30.151
PERMANENT HOUSING THAT I WANTED

03:15:30.218 --> 03:15:32.187
AT LEAST HIGHLIGHT AND PUT ON

03:15:32.253 --> 03:15:36.224
THE RECORD FOR FOR FUTURE --

03:15:36.291 --> 03:15:36.558
GENERATIONS.

03:15:36.624 --> 03:15:38.860
AS FAR AS PLANNING GOES YOU KNOW

03:15:38.927 --> 03:15:40.261
I THINK.

03:15:40.328 --> 03:15:41.463
I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO THINK YOU

03:15:41.529 --> 03:15:43.231
COUNTY WAS PRETTY PREPARED -- I

03:15:43.298 --> 03:15:44.399
THINK THE TEN A PARADISE TODAY I

03:15:44.466 --> 03:15:46.167
HAD A VERY ACTIVE FIRE ADVISORY

03:15:46.234 --> 03:15:46.935
COMMITTEE AND THEY HAD

03:15:47.001 --> 03:15:48.470
EVACUATION ROUTES IN THE AND IS

03:15:48.536 --> 03:15:49.504
THAT A LOT OF WORK.

03:15:49.571 --> 03:15:50.538
AND FORTUNATE WE'VE HAD A NUMBER

03:15:50.605 --> 03:15:52.707
OF FIRE SMALL MUCH SMALLER FIRES

03:15:52.774 --> 03:15:54.109
OVER THE YEARS WHERE WE'VE HAD A

03:15:54.175 --> 03:15:56.144
PRETTY EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM

03:15:56.211 --> 03:15:57.445
AND MERGE OPERATIONS CENTER AND

03:15:57.512 --> 03:16:00.115
WERE PRETTY PREPARED BUT TO SO

03:16:00.181 --> 03:16:01.049
MANY DOLLARS POINT THIS IS.

03:16:01.116 --> 03:16:01.649
PROBABLY A ONCE IN A LIFETIME

03:16:01.716 --> 03:16:03.618
FIRE ALL THE THE PERFECT

03:16:03.685 --> 03:16:06.020
CONDITIONS FOR A CRITICAL FIRE

03:16:06.087 --> 03:16:09.157
LINED UP IN IN IT HAPPENED --

03:16:09.224 --> 03:16:10.325
BUT WITH THAT SAID SOME THINGS

03:16:10.391 --> 03:16:12.193
THAT THAT I LIKE TO RECOMMEND

03:16:12.260 --> 03:16:13.328
FOR OTHER ENTITIES TO THINK

03:16:13.394 --> 03:16:14.896
ABOUT IN THE FUTURE.

03:16:14.963 --> 03:16:16.297
IF YOU'RE IN A BIT HIGH HAZARD

03:16:16.364 --> 03:16:17.665
AREA OR JUST ANY YEARS IS I

03:16:17.732 --> 03:16:18.666
THINK.

03:16:18.733 --> 03:16:20.001
THINKING AHEAD AND KNOWING WHAT

03:16:20.068 --> 03:16:21.669
YOUR INVENTORY IS LIFE AS FAR AS

03:16:21.736 --> 03:16:23.771
HOUSING GOES -- WHAT KIND OF

03:16:23.838 --> 03:16:25.039
PROPERTIES DO YOU HAVE WITH THE

MANUFACTURED HOMES TEMPORARY

03:16:38.353 --> 03:16:39.787
HOUSING ON IT'S BEEN A

03:16:39.854 --> 03:16:40.755
TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE WE'RE SIX

03:16:40.822 --> 03:16:42.123
MONTHS INTO THIS AND WE'RE STILL

03:16:42.190 --> 03:16:43.057
I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET OUR

03:16:43.124 --> 03:16:45.727

I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH FEMA AND

03:16:54.903 --> 03:16:56.738
YES HAVE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS BUT

03:16:56.804 --> 03:16:58.139
THERE'S JUST CHALLENGES.

03:16:58.206 --> 03:16:59.641
THAT IF YOU CAN DO SOME FORWARD

03:16:59.707 --> 03:17:01.543
THINKING PLAN AHEAD I THINK

03:17:01.609 --> 03:17:02.810
WOULD HELP US IN A HELP INTO

03:17:02.877 --> 03:17:04.279
THESE IN THE FUTURE SO.

03:17:04.345 --> 03:17:05.613
AGAIN IDENTIFY PROPERTIES

03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:07.415
POTENTIAL RENTAL CAPACITY AGAIN

03:17:07.482 --> 03:17:08.650
WE ARE IN A COMMUNITY WITHIN

03:17:08.716 --> 03:17:10.552
THAT HAD NEXT AND WE WERE PRETTY

03:17:10.618 --> 03:17:11.753
FULL CAPACITIES OF ALL THIS AND

03:17:11.819 --> 03:17:13.688

03:17:20.061 --> 03:17:23.965
CHALLENGE -- SO IDENTIFIED ANY.

03:17:24.032 --> 03:17:26.434
ALTERNATIVE -- LOCATIONS WITHIN

03:17:26.501 --> 03:17:27.268
YOUR COMMUNITY OR YOUR

03:17:27.335 --> 03:17:28.303
SURROUNDING COMMUNITY A LOT OF

03:17:28.369 --> 03:17:29.571
OUR FOLKS WANT TO STAY WITHIN

03:17:29.637 --> 03:17:30.905
OUR COMMUNITY WANT TO STAY THERE

03:17:30.972 --> 03:17:32.040
THEIR KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL THEY'RE

03:17:32.106 --> 03:17:33.208
INVESTED IN THE COMMUNITY LEVEL

03:17:33.274 --> 03:17:34.475
LIVING UP THERE THEY HAVE JOBS

03:17:34.542 --> 03:17:35.476
UP THERE SO.

03:17:35.543 --> 03:17:36.444
ANYTHING WITHIN THE COMMUTER

03:17:36.511 --> 03:17:38.179
WILL DISTANCE I WOULD RECOMMEND

03:17:38.246 --> 03:17:39.981
THAT ENTITIES LOOK AT TRY TO

03:17:40.048 --> 03:17:41.749
IDENTIFY OPTIONS WORK IF YOU

03:17:41.816 --> 03:17:43.017
HAVE A DISASTER EVEN A SMALLER

03:17:43.084 --> 03:17:44.886
SCALE WORKING PEOPLE.

03:17:44.953 --> 03:17:46.554
TEMPORARILY RESIDES HE CAN.

03:17:46.621 --> 03:17:47.388
KIND OF GET THOSE RELATIONSHIPS

03:17:47.455 --> 03:17:50.024
IN THOSE MAYBE PUT IN PLACE IN

03:17:50.091 --> 03:17:50.625
ADVANCE.

03:17:50.692 --> 03:17:53.461
THE BIG THING I THINK WOULD BE --

03:17:53.528 --> 03:17:54.662
AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIS

03:17:54.729 --> 03:17:56.064
AFTER SITTING DOWN WITH MORE

03:17:56.130 --> 03:17:58.266
WITH FEMA AND CAL WE **** AND

03:17:58.333 --> 03:17:59.567
TALK ABOUT LAND USE.

03:17:59.634 --> 03:18:01.936
RULES REGULATIONS THE POLITICAL

03:18:02.003 --> 03:18:04.272
CLIMATE THE APTITUDE THIS DISC

03:18:04.339 --> 03:18:05.440
ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE UNIQUE

03:18:05.506 --> 03:18:07.642
TO YEARS PARTICULAR JURISDICTION

03:18:07.709 --> 03:18:08.309
AS WELL I THINK WOULD GO A LONG

03:18:08.376 --> 03:18:10.511
WAYS -- AGAIN EVERYONE IS TRYING

03:18:10.578 --> 03:18:11.179
TO DO THEIR BEST BUT WHEN YOU'RE

03:18:11.246 --> 03:18:13.214
IN A MESS THE THE SITUATION THAT

03:18:13.281 --> 03:18:15.450
YOU'RE IN -- GET WAS ONE THING I

03:18:15.516 --> 03:18:16.217
THINK WE COULD HAVE DONE A

03:18:16.284 --> 03:18:17.385
LITTLE BETTER IS SET DOWN WITH

03:18:17.452 --> 03:18:18.720
EVERYBODY IS ABLE ONE TIME AND

03:18:18.786 --> 03:18:19.787
IDENTIFY.

03:18:19.854 --> 03:18:21.089
YOU KNOW JUST WHAT SOME OF THE

03:18:21.155 --> 03:18:24.592
THE ROAD BLOCKS MIGHT BE WITH

03:18:24.659 --> 03:18:26.561
WITH REGARDS -- TO HEALTHY

03:18:26.628 --> 03:18:27.028
OBVIOUS IF YOU COUNTY

03:18:27.095 --> 03:18:28.296
AGRICULTURE IS A VERY VERY VERY

03:18:28.363 --> 03:18:29.397
BIG.

03:18:29.464 --> 03:18:31.065
A COMPONENT OF OUR COMMUNITY AND

03:18:31.132 --> 03:18:32.267
AND THAT'S IT IT'S REALLY

03:18:32.333 --> 03:18:34.035
PROTECTED LAND THAT'S NOT

03:18:34.102 --> 03:18:34.802
SOMETHING WE WE WOULD WANT TO

03:18:34.869 --> 03:18:37.338
BUT HOUSING ON AND CERTAINLY

03:18:37.405 --> 03:18:37.905
THERE'S ENOUGH JEN AT THE

03:18:37.972 --> 03:18:39.407

03:18:58.326 --> 03:18:59.460
IMPACTED NOT ONLY JUST A TOWN OF

03:18:59.527 --> 03:19:01.562

THOUSAND PEOPLE COME TO THEIR

03:19:09.704 --> 03:19:11.039
COMMUNITY OVERNIGHT SO.

03:19:11.105 --> 03:19:11.673
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ABOUT

03:19:11.739 --> 03:19:12.840
OBVIOUSLY SERVICE LEVELS GO UP

03:19:12.907 --> 03:19:13.741
THERE'S THERE'S MUCH MORE

03:19:13.808 --> 03:19:15.410
TRAFFIC -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE

03:19:15.476 --> 03:19:16.711
NEED TO LIVE WITH THAT IT'S IT'S

03:19:16.778 --> 03:19:18.079
GOING TO BE THAT WAY WE WE HAVE

ANY ZONING ISSUES I THINK IT

03:19:33.594 --> 03:19:35.029

03:19:59.787 --> 03:20:01.489
HELPFUL -- BEYOND THAT I WOULD

THEY ARE IN REAL COMMUNITY

03:20:20.908 --> 03:20:21.709
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THAT

03:20:21.776 --> 03:20:23.277
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TETHERED

03:20:23.344 --> 03:20:25.279
TO A CELL PHONE -- SO WE HAVE TO

03:20:25.346 --> 03:20:26.748
BE COGNIZANT OF THAT I THINK

03:20:26.814 --> 03:20:28.983

TO BE SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF

03:20:33.654 --> 03:20:35.890
COMMUNITIES NEED TO LOOK AT

03:20:35.957 --> 03:20:37.425
BEYOND THAT I THINK WE'VE --

03:20:37.492 --> 03:20:38.393
WE'VE A LOT OF OTHER LESSONS

03:20:38.459 --> 03:20:40.361

HUNDRED HOUSING CHILDREN RIGHT

03:20:47.902 --> 03:20:49.337
NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PLACES

03:20:49.404 --> 03:20:50.104

THE WHERE DID OUR RESIDENTS GO

03:22:57.532 --> 03:22:58.533
TO LIVE IN THAT AREA I WISH I

03:22:58.599 --> 03:23:00.201
HAD A DATABASE OF LIKE I SAID AS

03:23:00.268 --> 03:23:01.269
WHO WAS THERE AND WHERE THEY GO.

03:23:01.335 --> 03:23:02.303
AND ARE THEY SAFE OR HOW DID

03:23:02.370 --> 03:23:02.870
THEY DID OR THE LIVING WITH

03:23:13.147 --> 03:23:15.283
EXPERIENCES.

03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:17.385
SO -- WITH THAT I I HAVE A

03:23:17.451 --> 03:23:19.053
COMMON I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO

03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:21.455
MISCARRY SO I GET COME I GET

03:23:21.522 --> 03:23:22.857
FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE

03:23:22.924 --> 03:23:24.759
YOU'RE COMING WITH WITH

03:23:24.825 --> 03:23:25.860
COMPETITION FUNDING.

03:23:25.927 --> 03:23:27.595
AND I THINK -- MISTER GALLAGHER

03:23:27.662 --> 03:23:28.529
IS PUTTING IN THE FACE THIS

03:23:28.596 --> 03:23:31.299
EXACT SAME THING IS BECAUSE SOME.

03:23:31.365 --> 03:23:32.733
I NEED TO FIND OUT AND I'M GOING

03:23:32.800 --> 03:23:34.635
TO DO THIS FOR YOU TO FIND OUT

03:23:34.702 --> 03:23:37.838
WHAT THE ACTUAL -- FORMULA IT IS

03:23:37.905 --> 03:23:39.674
TO COMPETE.

03:23:39.740 --> 03:23:41.776
WHAT IS IT THE WHY IS THE WE ARE

03:23:41.842 --> 03:23:42.743
NOT GETTING?

03:23:42.810 --> 03:23:44.545
THE OF FUNDING IN SOME OF OUR

03:23:44.612 --> 03:23:45.813
RURAL AREAS.

03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:47.281
AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

03:23:47.348 --> 03:23:49.083
WE'VE HAD OTHER THINGS ALONG THE

03:23:49.150 --> 03:23:50.017
WAY THAT I'M.

03:23:50.084 --> 03:23:51.852
IN WHETHER IT'S EDUCATION HEALTH

03:23:51.919 --> 03:23:53.955
CARE AND FUNDING AND THAT WE ARE

03:23:54.021 --> 03:23:55.389
UNABLE TO COMPETE BECAUSE THEY

03:23:55.456 --> 03:23:57.124
CONSIDER SOME OF OUR AREAS ARE

03:23:57.191 --> 03:23:58.693
MORE IN SUBURBAN AREAS.

03:23:58.759 --> 03:23:59.860
WHEN WE'RE REALLY IN A RURAL

03:23:59.927 --> 03:24:02.163
AREA COMPETING WITH LARGER

03:24:02.229 --> 03:24:02.630
COMMUNITIES?

03:24:02.697 --> 03:24:05.232
SO AND IF I MAY JUST RESPONDED

03:24:05.299 --> 03:24:07.068
THAT REALLY QUICKLY I WOULD LIKE

03:24:07.134 --> 03:24:08.569
TO THROW OUT THERE THAT YOLO IS

03:24:08.636 --> 03:24:10.204
INCREDIBLY PROGRESSIVE IN

03:24:10.271 --> 03:24:11.606

SO THE FACT THAT IT'S HARD FOR

03:24:28.055 --> 03:24:28.756
US.

03:24:28.823 --> 03:24:29.890

DISTRICT.

03:26:39.887 --> 03:26:41.122

FIRES IN YOUR YOUR DISTRICT.

03:27:01.909 --> 03:27:03.778
I NEVER WOULD'VE IMAGINED THAT.

YOU NEED TO BE READY -- FOR AND

03:27:21.829 --> 03:27:26.267
IT'S IT'S UNFORTUNATE -- AND YET.

03:27:26.333 --> 03:27:27.368
THE FACT THAT YOU WENT THROUGH

03:27:27.434 --> 03:27:29.270
THAT AND THAT YOU GUYS IN YOUR

03:27:29.336 --> 03:27:29.770
COMMUNITIES HAVE KIND OF

03:27:29.837 --> 03:27:31.472
DEVELOPED.

03:27:31.539 --> 03:27:33.841
IN A WAY -- A TEMPLATE FOR HOW

03:27:33.908 --> 03:27:35.442
YOU CAN YOU KNOW COME BACK AND

03:27:35.509 --> 03:27:36.677
HOW YOU CAN START PLANNING FOR

03:27:36.744 --> 03:27:38.179
THESE THINGS IN THE FUTURE AND I

03:27:38.245 --> 03:27:40.014
THINK THAT'S GOOD AND AND BRIAN

03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:42.116
HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW RUNNING OUR

03:27:42.183 --> 03:27:44.051
ORDERS ARE JOINT TASK FORCE THE

03:27:44.118 --> 03:27:45.786
UNITED I BELIEVE THE TEMPLE WAS

03:27:45.853 --> 03:27:48.022
KINDA STARTED IN IN CINEMA --

03:27:48.088 --> 03:27:50.491
BUT YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE SURE

03:27:50.558 --> 03:27:53.060
THAT ALL THE FEDERAL STATE AND

03:27:53.127 --> 03:27:54.461
LOCAL RESOURCES ARE TRYING TO

03:27:54.528 --> 03:27:55.763
TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WORK

03:27:55.830 --> 03:27:57.898
TOGETHER AND THAT'S BEEN A NO.

03:27:57.965 --> 03:27:58.532
YOU KNOW.

03:27:58.599 --> 03:28:00.701
SOMETIMES JEAN YOU KNOW AND BUT

03:28:00.768 --> 03:28:03.237
WE'VE ACTUALLY WORKED REALLY

03:28:03.304 --> 03:28:04.605
WELL TOGETHER I THINK.

03:28:04.672 --> 03:28:06.340
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS.

03:28:06.407 --> 03:28:07.508
TWO THINGS I JUST KNOW THAT WE

03:28:07.575 --> 03:28:09.143
KIND OF BROUGHT UP.

03:28:09.210 --> 03:28:11.278
YOU KNOW FEMA HAS A TEN YOU KNOW

03:28:11.345 --> 03:28:13.380
HAS THEIR WAY OF DOING THINGS IN

03:28:13.447 --> 03:28:14.849
TERMS OF INTERIM HOUSING.

03:28:14.915 --> 03:28:17.017
AND YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S SOME

03:28:17.084 --> 03:28:18.085
IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED OVER TIME

03:28:18.152 --> 03:28:18.986
BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS

03:28:19.053 --> 03:28:20.454
ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS THEY

03:28:20.521 --> 03:28:22.656
LOOK. TO BRING IN TEMPORARY

03:28:22.723 --> 03:28:24.625
INTERIM HOUSING LIKE MOBILE MH

03:28:24.692 --> 03:28:26.994
USE AND TRAILERS THEY WANT TO

03:28:27.061 --> 03:28:28.796
FIND SITES THAT ALREADY HAVE

03:28:28.863 --> 03:28:30.064
SEWER AND WATER.

03:28:30.130 --> 03:28:31.732
AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THEM YOU

03:28:31.799 --> 03:28:33.367
KNOW AND AND THEN.

03:28:33.434 --> 03:28:34.535
YOU ALSO TRYING TO FIND THOSE

03:28:34.602 --> 03:28:36.036
KIND OF SITES I THINK WE'VE GOT

03:28:36.103 --> 03:28:37.037
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUTSIDE

03:28:37.104 --> 03:28:38.572
THE BOX ON THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE

03:28:38.639 --> 03:28:39.740
NEED HOUSING.

03:28:39.807 --> 03:28:41.308
AND WE MAY NOT HAVE SEWER AND

03:28:41.375 --> 03:28:42.309
WATER THERE BUT MAYBE THERE'S

03:28:42.376 --> 03:28:43.277
OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH OUR

03:28:43.344 --> 03:28:44.778
TECHNOLOGY WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE

03:28:44.845 --> 03:28:46.347
OUT HOW TO HAVE YOU KNOW ABOVE

03:28:46.413 --> 03:28:48.249
GROUND WATER TANKS AND AND YOU

03:28:48.315 --> 03:28:49.950
KNOW.

03:28:50.017 --> 03:28:52.419
MAYBE INTERNAL YOU KNOW SEWAGE

03:28:52.486 --> 03:28:54.555
UNITS THAT CAN BE USED THEIR YOU

03:28:54.622 --> 03:28:56.824
KNOW -- TO BRING THAT.

03:28:56.891 --> 03:28:57.391
YOU KNOW TO BRING UP SITES

03:28:57.458 --> 03:28:58.859
QUICKER AND AND QUITE FRANKLY

03:28:58.926 --> 03:29:02.730
RENDON BE ISM TO WE DO YOU KNOW --

03:29:02.796 --> 03:29:03.497
PEOPLE SAY A LOT I WANT THAT

03:29:03.564 --> 03:29:04.431
HERE.

03:29:04.498 --> 03:29:07.067
AND YOU KNOW IN AN EMERGENCY.

03:29:07.134 --> 03:29:08.769
YOU KNOW WE NEED THE HOUSING

03:29:08.836 --> 03:29:10.471
RIGHT AND AND I THINK WE RUN

03:29:10.537 --> 03:29:11.438
INTO THAT EVEN WE'RE TALKING

03:29:11.505 --> 03:29:12.740
ABOUT BUILDING MORE PERMANENT

03:29:12.806 --> 03:29:15.309
HOUSING AND THE REASON IN THE

03:29:15.376 --> 03:29:17.611
REGION -- AND SO THAT THAT'S A

03:29:17.678 --> 03:29:19.146
SECOND FOR INTERIM I THINK WE

03:29:19.213 --> 03:29:20.648
NEED TO FIND BETTER WAYS TO

03:29:20.714 --> 03:29:23.017
BRING ON TRAILERS IN AND ENTER

03:29:23.083 --> 03:29:27.855
AND EMERGENCY HOUSING -- SOONER --

03:29:27.922 --> 03:29:29.123
AND REMOVE SOME OF THE

03:29:29.189 --> 03:29:30.324
ROADBLOCKS TO THAT.

03:29:30.391 --> 03:29:32.126
BUT THEN LONG TERM YOU KNOW

03:29:32.192 --> 03:29:32.793
FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THIS PLACE

03:29:32.860 --> 03:29:35.062
WE HAVE TO BUILD HOUSING AND WE

03:29:35.129 --> 03:29:38.132
NEED TO DO IT IN A IN A MUCH.

03:29:38.198 --> 03:29:40.034
MORE STREAMLINED FASTER WAY ASSN

FOR BUTTE COUNTY MAYBE -- FOUR

03:29:45.205 --> 03:29:45.739
THIRTY BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

03:29:45.806 --> 03:29:47.474
START THINKING ABOUT THAT IN

03:29:47.541 --> 03:29:49.009
THESE KIND OF SITUATIONS.

03:29:49.076 --> 03:29:50.144
AND HOW DO WE HELP OUR OUR

03:29:50.210 --> 03:29:51.278
BUILDING COMMUNITY HOW DO WE

03:29:51.345 --> 03:29:54.748
HELP OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS --

03:29:54.815 --> 03:29:56.116
ENSURE THAT THEY CAN BRING THAT

03:29:56.183 --> 03:29:57.952

TRY TO STREAMLINE THAT.

03:30:13.300 --> 03:30:14.635

PLANNED YOU KNOW BUT DO IT IN A

03:30:16.904 --> 03:30:19.707
