ISSUE THAT WILL BE A FACTOR IN EQUITY STRATEGIC PLAN WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE INEQUITIES ACROSS OUR STATE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PROCESS MEASURES LIKE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OTHER SERVICES ORANGE OUT. I'M MEASURES LIKE I'M- LIFE EXPECTANCY WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE THOSE. THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA THIS OCCURS HERBAL URBAN AND GROW AREA ALL WE ARE AND RURAL AREAS THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WE CONSIDER IN OUR PLANNING PROCESS SO WE'RE NOT LEAVING ANY COMMUNITY BEHIND AND I THINK RIGHT NOW GEOGRAPHIC DATA IS GETTING MUCH MORE GRANULAR ALLOWING US TO SPOT INEQUITIES AND MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT INVESTMENTS AND THE PLAN IS ANTICIPATING TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WITH THAT CHAIR I WILL CLASS TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY. QUESTIONS YOU PERMANENTLY. THE PERMANENT HUNG THANK FOR THE FACT. LOL A GOOD AFTERNOON- DOCTOR AMBULANCE WHEN YOU PICK WITH THE L. A. O- WE'VE REVIEWED THIS PARTICULAR REQUEST AND DO NOT RAISE ANY CONCERNS. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE D√çAS SO I WILL START MISS RUIZ IF I CAN- THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT- WANTED TO LOOK AT HOW WE WERE GOING TO ENSURE THAT OUR HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS WERE GOING TO SEE SOME OF THE SAME. ATTENTION THAT WE'VE- PROVIDED TOWARDS OUR HEALTH PROGRAMS AND WANTED TO HEAR EXPLICITLY FROM YOU HOW WE WERE GOING TO ENSURE. THAT HUMAN SERVICES WERE GOING TO HAVE AND LENDS OF EQUITY- IN PROGRAMS HOPING YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT. ABSOLUTELY CHAIR SO AS YOU ARE AWARE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES ALREADY UNDER WAY WITHIN HUMAN SERVICES SHE WOULD-DRIVE IN EQUITY AND IN OUR PROGRAMS. IN INCLUDING BANK CAL OR IN CALIFORNIA CLASS LAST YEAR DRAFT NEXT WEEK'S WITHIN OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM. OUT WHICH INVEST. CALPERS TO ADDRESS. THE ISSUE AS WELL AS I THINK ARE ARE IMMIGRATION PORTFOLIO WHICH INSURANCE THAT COMMUNITIES WHO ARE BY DESIGN INCLUDING- EXCLUDED FROM SOME PROGRAMS HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES TO ALLOW THEM TO RECOGNIZE THEIR STATUS TO BE ABLE TO- BOTH ACHIEVE GREATER ECONOMIC STABILITY BUT ALSO ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. ALL OF THAT INFORMATION ALL OF THIS INITIATIVE. IN FIRST PLANET I THINK THAT- CDSS LITTLE SERVICES I HAD A LONG OF WORKING ON EQUITY ISSUES WILL BE TO GUIDE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT OF THE FINAL CLASS I THINK IS TERRIFIC HERE FOR A LINE- AND SHARED THAT WILL IN ALSO THE ARE FAST. WHAT ABLE TO OUR VAST JUST BUT BUT LOCAL PERSON- I'M MAY FOCUS THE NUMBER BUT EXAMPLES SO THAT I CAN THEN SEE HOW WE CAN- MAKE SUGGESTIONS OR IMPROVEMENTS OF POSSIBLE BUT ONE TO FOCUS. L. L. C. SAYS WHERE WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THE- IN. PURCHASES OF. HOW WILL THE EQUITY. PLAN FOCUSED ON PRO WHERE WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED DSPARITIES. THAT WE KNOW ARE EMPIRICALLY WIDE AND DEEP WHAT SPECIFICALLY CAN WE DO WITH AND THIS OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO HELP US OUT WITH THAT. TURN I'M GONNA I THINK THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE QUESTIONS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THOSE ANSWERS JUST YET WE PLAN TO IS THE- BIG PLANTINGS THIS PROCESS. CHECK NUMBER WAS VERY TYPES OF QUESTIONS PARTICULARLY WHERE WE IDENTIFY THOSE INEQUITIES- BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE THIS QUESTION BACK AND. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS WELL. THANK FOR THAT AND I WOULD ADD- UNDER URBAN RURAL COAST AND INLAND YOU HAD PROCESS MEASURES AN OUTCOME MEASURES BUT- OFTENTIMES WE ALSO HAVE BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AS WELL AS- DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT STATUS. IN OUR IMMIGRATION AND BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION BUT JUST TO THINK BROADLY. ABOUT ALL OF THE HURDLES THAT SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN ACCESSING RESOURCES- WITH THAT I WILL THANKS VERY MUCH THIS PANEL WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWO ON THE OFFICE. BILLION SPONSOR BE. WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL FOR ISSUE TWO. IT WILL BEGIN WITH LIZ BASSINET CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER WITH CALIFORNIA HHS AND ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. FOLLOWED BY NINA ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON YOUR PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. L. LET'S BEGIN WITH LIZ BASSINET CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER FOR COLLEGE IT JUST. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY ARE YOU MENTION MY NAME BILLS WITH BASS AND I'M THE CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. SO AS YOU'RE AWARE DISASTERS IN CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE A SEASON ANY LONGER WE'RE VERY MUCH IN THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CYCLE AND THIS CAUSES DEPARTMENTS TO CONSISTENTLY HAVE OUR DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE PARALLEL RATIONS UP FOR MULTIPLE DISASTERS AT THE SAME TIME SO WHAT DOES THAT REALLY LOOK LIKE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS OBVIOUSLY. WE'RE STILL ACTIVELY PURSUING WILDFIRE RECOVERY OPERATIONS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO KOBE AS WELL AS PREPARING FOR AND STARTING TO RESPOND TO ADDRESS. PREPARING FOR ANOTHER MAJOR FIRES- AND WE HAVE THE GEOGRAPHICALLY DEFINED MISSIONS A WITH AN AGENCY SUCH AS A BORDER OR OTHER- INCIDENTS THAT OCCUR. SO CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WAS REAL ORIGINALLY DESIGNED. TO COORDINATE AND MANAGE THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF OR SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT MISSION ALONE REQUIRES ALL THE STAFF THAT. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. ZERO OVERSEAS AS YOU KNOW MOST A SMALL OFFICE SO PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN A DISASTER OCCURRED THE DURATION WAS MUCH SHORTER WE WORK ON THIS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. RESPONSE OPERATION. INDIVIDUALS WITHIN CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES COULD BE REDIRECTED TEMPORARILY TO GUIDE OUR DEPARTMENTSAND THEIR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY REMEMBER. S. OPERATE. COULD BE READ BACK FOR- THE POLICY FISCAL PRO MANAGE OF THE HEALTH IN HUMANS PROJECT BECAUSE OF THE CYCLE THAT WE'RE IN AND HAVE MAINTAIN NOW FOR MULTIPLE YEARS THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE AND A FULL TIME DEDICATED OFFICE AND TEAM ARE REALLY REQUIRED TO COORDINATE AND MANAGE OUR DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES THROUGH THE DISASTER CONTINUE ON. SO AS YOU ARE AWARE WERE REQUESTING I JUST UNDER TWO POINT SIX MILLION OF ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS FOR NINE POSITIONS TO HELP OVERSEE EACH FIVE CRITICAL PROGRAMMING AREAS. FOR THIS OFFICE WITH OUR DEPARTMENT SO IT WOULD BE PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE RECOVERY MITIGATION RESILIENCE AND SPECIAL PROJECTS. I E. PARTICIPATING IN EQUITY PLANNING OR CLIMATE CHANGE EXCEPT DROUGHT AS WE MOVE THROUGH SO REALLY AS A RESULT DOES REQUIRES THESE DEDICATED RESOURCES IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SKATE ALL. TO THE CONSTANT NATURE OF EMERGENCIES AND ADDING THIS NEW STAFF WITHIN THE OFFICE OF RESPONSE RESILIENCE WITHIN CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ALLOWS US TO HAVE A MORE APPROPRIATE SPAN OF CONTROL. AND WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR- DEPARTMENTS A DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT. AND ALL OF OUR POLICIES RESPOND. NOT SO WITH THAT ALL PUBLIC AND SEE IF THEY ANY. NINO ONE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD. FROM THE PADDOCK WITH L. L. C. PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. O. CAL A TEACHER INDICATE THAT A FOR THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THE CREATION OF THIS OFFICE RATHER THAN PERMANENT FUNDING IN ORDER TO TAKE A STEP BACK AT THE END OF THE THREE YEARS AND RE EVALUATE. THEY ARE. AND I'M- AND- YOU KNOW WHETHER THE OFFICE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL OR CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE SO WE WOULD KNOW HOWEVER THAT THE PROPOSAL LACKS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEIR HOW THE SORT OF RE EVALUATION OR EVALUATION WOULD WORK SO FOR EXAMPLE WILL CAL HHS CONDUCT A FORMAL ASSESSMENT- AND WHAT WE'LL CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE OFFICE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN WARRANT WARRANTS PERMANENT FUNDING- NOR DOES THE PROPOSAL DESCRIBE HOW KELLY TEACHERS WOULD INVOLVE THE LEGISLATURE IN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION SO WE SUBJECT ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION. ABOUT THIS- FINALLY WE NOTE THERE'S NO COME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROPOSAL- THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE IMPORTANT FOR IRONING OUT THE DETAILS AND LAYING OUT THE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE OFFICE AND WE SUGGEST THAT YOU ASK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR SUCH LANGUAGES SOON AS- FEASIBLE TO THE DIESS I WILL- TURNED TO MIST BASSINET IF I CAN- I'M QUITE- IMPRESSED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO PREPARE FOR AN EMERGENCY WHEN WE ARE NOT IN ONE. AND THUS I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE APPROPRIATE STAFF WHO ARE DEDICATED TO THE RESILIENCE AND RESPONSE WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY. BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK WHY IT'S ONLY LIMITED TERM FOR THESE THREE YEAR PERIOD AS WELL AS WHAT OUTCOMES- WE ARE ANTICIPATING OR HOW WE WILL MEASURE SUCCESS WITHIN THIS NEW OFFICE HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. YES ABSOLUTELY SO FOR THE FIRST PIECE OF BEING- AS WAS. INDICATED IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND KIND OF DO THIS FORMAL ASSESSMENT AT THE END OF THE THREE YEARS TO ENSURE. THAT WHAT WE'RE SETTING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL THAT WE'RE GETTING THE RIGHT RESOURCES TO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. AND THAT OUR OVER ARCHING POLICY IS- DAUGHTER BEING DEVELOPED AS DATA COMES IN FROM ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. THAT ACTUALLY. DOES FOR SUBSEQUENT RESPONSES HAD. A GOOD IMPACT. YOU KNOW A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS OBVIOUSLY IS WITH DROUGHT. TOP OF EVERYONE'S MIND AND SO REALLY AN ASSESSMENT AS EVEN RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WE'VE CREATED OUR DROUGHT ACTION PLAN AS A OUT OF AGENCIES ARE CROSSCUTTING ARGUMENTS THAT ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS KNOW. THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DROUGHT HOW GOING TO BE RESPONDING AND HOW ARE DIFFERENT PROGRAM. AND DIFFERENT WORK EACH OTHER. WHETHER THAT BE LOOKING UP THE NUMBER OF CALIBRATION CAL WORKS APPLE CANCER THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY HEALTH CARE PLANS. SUCH YOUR WORK PURCHASE IN THAT. BEING ABLE TO. DATA OF THE HIGH LEVEL. FOR POLICY AND THEN SHARE IT BACK DOWN THE ROAD APART IN ORDER TO DRIVE TO RESPONSE I THINK IT'S- IS. AND YOU HAVE MEANT IN YOUR REAL. THAT IT WAS A FORMER US. HAVE WE- HAVE WE FORMALIZE THAT AS WELL AS- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO PLEASE PROVIDE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS NEW OFFICE BEFORE OR- AT THE TIME OF MAY REVISE AND JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS AMENABLE TO THAT. YES WE RECEIVE THAT FEEDBACK AND ARE WORKING ON TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- IN TERMS OF THE FORMALITY OF THE ASSESSMENT I THINK THERE ARE STILL METRICS OF SUCCESS THAT NEED TO BE DETERMINED BUT CERTAINLY WITHIN THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL ITSELF. THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC METRICS ATTACHED TO DAYS- BETTER MILESTONES THAT ARE KEY FOR US TO MEET WITH THE CREATION OF THIS NEW OFFICE AND THEN VERY MUCH. IF WE MET THIS METRIC WHAT DID THAT MEAN FOR THE PATIENT OR THE WHOLE OF PERSON ON THE GROUND AND REALLY BE ABLE TO DELINEATE THOSE THINGS OUT. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL WE WILL HOLD FOR THIS ITEM OPEN AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE WHICH IS ON THE OFFICE OF AGENCY INFORMATION OFFICER. AND THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION ENTERPRISE CAPABILITIES BCP. WE WILL HAVE FOR PRESENT. AND THIS ISSUE FOR PANEL THREE BEGINNING WITH ADAM DONDERO. DEPUTY SECRETARY AND AGENCY CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER WITH CAL HHS. FOLLOWED BY DEANNA WORDEN DEPUTY AGENCY INFORMATION OFFICER WITH CALLIE TRADE. NINA HUANG WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND BRIAN METZGER WITH THE L. A. L. LET'S BEGIN WITH ADAM DONDERO PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU GET YOUR CHAIR MEMBERS OPERATIONS OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THIS PROPOSAL AROUND BRINGING MORE ENTERPRISE APPROACH TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY APLIKASI CAN THINK AND I'M GOING TO HAND IT OVER TO OUR DEPUTY ALBION ONE HAD A CAMERA FAILURE MADE YOU CAN KICK US OFF WHILE I TRY TO GET THAT BACK WORKING. NOT A PROBLEM YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY. SO DID YOU SEE IN THE PROPOSAL WERE PROPOSED BEING RESOURCES THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME ALLOW CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. TO BRING THAT ENTERPRISE APPROACH TO THE WAY THAT WE CAN DAHLE INFLAMMATION TECHNOLOGY. THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WITH MY OFFICE WE'VE BEEN TYPICALLY FOCUS ON. PROJECT OVERSIGHT WITH SMALL ABILITY TO DO OTHER WORK IN THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION ATTEMPTS BUT SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED. ON DOING THE LARGE SCALE COMPLEX PROJECT THE BUSINESS. PORTFOLIO BUT IN OUR OFFICE TO GATHER. IS TO BREAK OUT OF THE SILOS IN THE PRODUCT AND OFFICES. I THEIR- NEEDS WITHOUT THAT SCOPE OF WHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS THE AGENCY AND BEING ABLE TO WRITE. MEANS BY WHICH TO SHARE EXPERTISE SHARE RESOURCES GIVEN SHARE SYSTEMS. A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES THERE. APAN THEIR DM. AND SO HERE IS. WELL NOT A PROBLEM. THE IDEA IS THAT AT THE AGENCY LEVEL WE NEED RESOURCES WHO ARE NOT FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND YOU'VE SEEN WHAT MANY ID PROPOSAL BUT THE PROMPTER THAT SUBCOMMITTEE. THEY ARE SO. TO PARTICULAR PART LOOKING PROJECT TEMPLE VOLUME. LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY. LOOKING AT SECURITY THAT ALLOW US TO START LOOKING AT THINGS ACROSS THE ENTIRETY OFTHE AGENCY NOT A LOT OF BENEFITS TO GO TO THAT. SPECIFICALLY BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE SERVICES WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THE AND YOU WANT TO JUMP ON. SHURIKENS TO THE ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT WE PLAN TO STAND UP AND THIS WILL GIVE US A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR EXISTING AND OUR PLANNED IT ASSETS THOUGH. HAVING THAT AGENCY WIDE UNDERSTANDING WILL INFORM OUR PLANNING AND OUR PRIORITIZATION IN THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE BEAT THAT WE DECIDE TO MAKE IT. AS AN ARE INTERNET. WORKING ON THE ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WILL ALSO INCLUDE SOME DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING PROCESSES THAT ARE NEEDED TO MAKE THOSE KEY DECISIONS. AND WILL IDENTIFY POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO REUSE OUR EXISTING SOLUTIONS AND THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO LEVERAGE OUR PRIOR. INVESTMENTS AND TO REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORTING NEW PROGRAMS FROM SIMILAR CAPABILITIES. FINALLY IT WILL INFORM THE TO THE- OF SOLUTIONS THAT REALLY INTEGRATE AND WORK TOGETHER AS ADAM TALKED ABOUT THIS CROSS AGENCY PERSPECTIVE IS VERY IMPORTANT. AS IT SUPPORTS-OUR AGENCIES PRIORITIES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ALLOWS FOR THAT DATA SHARING THAT HELPS US INFORM THE POLICY THE PROGRAM DESIGN. I REALLY JUST BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION THAT WE THAT WE SERVE. ADAM ALSO MENTIONED A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE WE DO PROPOSED TO PUT TOGETHER A SMALL CENTER OF EXCELLENCE THAT CAN HELP ACCELERATE IN AND IMPROVE THE DELIVERY IN THE QUALITY OF THE I. T. SOLUTIONS. THIS IS A COUPLE OF AREAS FIRST OF. HHS HELPING HUMANS SPECIFIC TOOLS I TEMPLATES PLANNING GUIDANCE THAT ARE BASED ON PROVEN PRACTICES BUT OF COURSE THE LINE WITH THE CDT REQUIREMENTS BUT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE. PROGRAMMATIC ASPECTS OF THE THAT WE HAVE. THIS APPOINTMENT FOUNDATION FOR THE HIGHER QUALITY MORE EFFICIENT PLANNING AND THE SPEED. TO DELIVERY IF THOSE BUSINESS BENEFITS IN THE BUSINESS CAPABILITIES THAT ARE DEPARTMENTS VERY MUCH NEAT. OUR RESOURCES WILL DEVELOP THESE MAINTAIN THEM AND UPDATE THEM AS WE LEARN MORE AS WE IDENTIFY NEW STRATEGIES THAT WILL REDUCE THE TIME COST AND RISK AND WILL WORK DIRECTLY WITH A PARTNER. THE USE THESE. THIS INCREASE SOUTH A WELL WILL REDUCE THE RELY ON VENDORS TO HELP US PLAN. OUR SOLUTIONS AND IT WE FIND THAT pEMPLOYEES SKILLS AND RETENTION WHICH IS CRITICAL RIGHT NOW FOR THE TEAMS THAT WE HAVE. AS PART OF THIS CENTER OF EXCELLENCE WILL ALSO HAVE A SMALL SET OF HIGHLY EXPERIENCED TECHNOLOGIST IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET SOME OF THESE KEY SKILLS IN THE MARKET TODAY. I AM THESE TECHNOLOGISTS CAN HELP ITS JUMPSTART AND AUGMENT THE TEAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EARLY PLANNING WORK IN ONGOING PLANNING WORK RELATED TO THINGS LIKE ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE. DATA ARCHITECTURE SOLUTION INTEGRATION CYBER SECURITY TO MAKE SURE DEPARTMENT HAVE THE SKILL SETS AT THE READY FOR THEM AS THEY EMBARK ON THE SOLUTIONS. THIS WILL BE A PARTICULAR BENEFIT- SMALLER DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO OUR LARGE APARTMENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS AND THE ACCESS THESE THREE. SCRIPT BECAUSE WITHOUT WE DON'T LET OUR PRIDE SINCE WE END UP SOLUTIONS AND WILLING. IN THIS KEY AREAS. SO I'M- THIS PROPOSAL IS GOING TO HELP US DO A FEW THINGS SPEND THE LIMITED RESOURCES WHERE THEY'RE MOST NEEDED TO MANAGE BUILDING SUPPORTER ID EFFORTS MORE HOLISTICALLY DELIVER THE BENEFIT OF I. T. MORE QUICKLY AND AT A LOWER COST ALLOWING HER PROGRAMS TO FOCUS ON THE RESOURCES THAT HELP PEOPLE DIRECTLY AND DRIVE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT OUR AGENCY AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES FOR HELPING THE CALIFORNIANS NEED. VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR GENERATION APOLOGIZE FOR THE CAMERA ISSUES AND AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU WE WILL MEXICO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE CURRENT FINANCING HUNG NOTHING FURTHER AT. THANK YOU PRIME MINISTER WITH THE L. L. PRIME MINISTER ALAIA WE REVIEWED THIS PROPOSAL HAVE NO CONCERNS. THANK YOU- BRING IT UP TO THE DENTIST TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS I WILL BEGIN WITH. GROWER MISS HORTON IF I CAN I'M I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN. I HEARD THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON MORE HOLISTIC ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL BOTH LOWER COST AND DRIVE SOLUTIONS. INTO OUR- SYSTEMS BUT I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN GIVE US SOME SPECIFIC OUTCOMES FOR CLIENTS THAT CAN BE EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK. CAN YOU GIVE US A FEW EXAMPLES. WE'LL SEE. AS A RESULT OF THIS FUNDING. I CAN CERTAINLY GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES OF A HIGH LEVEL AND THEN I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH A COUPLE THAT IF IN PLACE WE COULD DELIVER THEM THE RELATED BENEFITS SO I MENTIONED THAT THE PROPOSAL SUPPORT MORE TIMELY DELIVERY- AND THAT THEY'LL MAKE BEST USE. AND WILL. RIGHT THE AREAS THAT I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON FOR US AT THE AGENCY LEVEL IS THE EXPANSION OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUPPORTING HOLISTIC CARE FOR MEDICARE OPULATION THIS WORK REALLY EXTENDS BEYOND THE WORK BEING DONE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BECAUSE MANY OF THE SERVICES AND SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED TO INFORM CENTER APPROACH TO AND TO WELL BEING INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL. AND RESIDE IN APARTMENTS ULTIMATELY AL INTEGRATE WITH THE MEDICAL SYSTEMS AND WITH OTHER SYSTEMS IN OUR DEPARTMENT HAVING THIS ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT YOU ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND AND LOOK AT ALL OF THIS DEPENDENCIES INTER DEPENDENCIES AND RIGHT SURE THAT WERE INFORMING THOSE MOTIONS EARLY BECAUSE WE DON'T WE END UP WITH A SILENT SOLUTION THAT THEN REQUIRES REDEVELOPMENT ADDITIONAL DOLLARS AND JUST DOESN'T LET US SHARE THE DATA THAT WE NEED TO SHARE. IT FEELS LIKE AN INDIRECT. IMPACT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T GET US ORDER TO. WHAT WE NEED OR AGENCY WHAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY SIR CALIFORNIANS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THAT- IN TERMS OF PROVIDING THOSE AUGMENTED RESOURCES DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HAS TAKEN ON A TREMENDOUS PROGRAMMATIC GROWTH. AND THEY HAVE TO BUILD THE I. T. SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT THERE'S REALLY NO OPTION BUT GETTING RESOURCES RECREATED AND ONBOARDED QUICKLY ENOUGH EVEN IN THOSE IT ESPECIALLY THOSE KEY SKILLS AT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND SO THROUGH THE SEPARATE I MENTIONED JUMPSTARTING IN AUGMENTING PROGRESS OF PROJECTS THIS CAN IN THIS HAS THIS DIRECT IMPACT. OF SPEECH. EVERY OF THE PROJECT WE DON'T HAVE THE DELAYS. IN GETTING THE BILL ABOUT OUT BY T. OF BRING. ACTUALLY PROVIDING SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS SINGER WE HAVE THESE PROGRAMS BUT IF WE CAN'T SUPPORT THEM WITH TECHNOLOGY IN A TIMELY MANNER WE CAN'T DELIVER THAT BUSINESS VALUE. I'M IN I THINK YOU KNOW A GOOD EXAMPLE TWO OF THE WORK THAT OUR SITE IS ALREADY DOING THAT LEANS TOWARDS THIS IS THE ARE. YOU POSTING STEP WITHIN THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY M. IT'S A VERY LARGE EFFORT ASSIGNED TO AN ORGANIZATION WITH LIMITED PRIOR EXPERIENCE AND SKILL RESOURCES SENATE WOULD HAVE REQUIRED CONSIDERABLE AND CHALLENGE RECRUITING AND TRAINING EFFORTS. IF I WERE SIGNED AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO AUGMENT THAT. I'M WE HAVE OTHER DEPARTMENTS EARLY AND SOME THINGS. AGING ALSO SMALLER A MASSIVE YOU'RE TAKING WITH EIGHT MASTER H. SO. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WE- WILL HELP ACCELERATE THIS BUSINESS BENEFITS AND GET SERVICES INTO THE HANDS OF OUR POPULATION CENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE- I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO BRING IN SILOS AS IT REALLY SEEMS THEY ARE BREAKING DOWN MANY OF THOSE SILOS. WITH CREATING AND HAVING. AN ENTERPRISE SOLUTION AND HAVING THE VANTAGE POINT THAT YOU DO. BRING UP THE POST IS CLOSE TO MY OFFICE AS WE WERE VERY INVOLVED ENSURING- THE THIS WAS INCLUDE INTO LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BREAK THOSE SILOS SO WE CAN BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND- NOW WOULD LIKE TO TRANSITION IF I CAN YOU SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY AND- THIS IS ALL. JUST LET. TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE. BUILDING SYSTEMS THAT WILL MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SUCCESS OF. THIS INITIATIVE SPECIFICALLY. SO I'D LIKE TO ASK HOW WE MAKE QUANTIFY AS WELL AS ON WHAT TIME BASIS WILL THIS OCCUR SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE LEGISLATURE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I'LL TURN THAT OVER TO YOU GIVEN OUR DISCUSSIONS. ABSOLUTELY YEAH AND IT STOP WHEN YOU'RE SETTING UP THE FOUNDATIONS FOR A PROJECT- TO PUT THOSE METRICS IN PLACE I THINK THAT AS WE LOOK AT WHAT WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE OVER THE NEXT ONE TO TWO YEARS. WHEN YOU ASK IN TERMS OF CRIME I UNDERSTAND THAT THANKS. FOR TALKING ABOUT. JENNIFER THESE SERVICES THE- PROVIDED AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL THE DEPARTMENT NEED LIKE A PENSION WOULD BE COULD COUNT ON A- LOOK AT. PROJECT INTAKE IT OUT PUT THE WOE WE CALL BY DOES THE- IN THE FIELD SERVICE. AND BEING ABLE TO RIDE. WHAT SKILLS. AND WE PUT IN PLACE IN THE BANNER BACK ONCE WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES AND ALIGN IN NUMBER THE NEED. ALONG WITH ANY GAPS THAT WE IDENTIFY IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL NEEDS WHERE WE COULD DO TAKE. THIS MORE ENTERPRISE APPROACH TO PROVIDE IT. WILL BE ABLE TO DOCUMENT THOSE. ADDITIONALLY IN TERMS OF WHAT ADIANTUM. THEN THE ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AT THE DEPARTMENT. I MEAN MEANT THAT THEY- TO ESTABLISH THAT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WE USE SHARED. AB AND AGENCIES ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE APPROACH THAT ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY THOSE OPPORTUNITIES EVEN BEFORE PROPOSAL MADE WELL WE CAN START GETTING IN FRONT OF THOSE AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL START TO SEE WHAT WE CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN PHOTOS THAT YOU I MEAN FOR ONE STATE I'M NOT ENTERPRISE APPROACH YOUR JOURNALISM MODEL. WE WANT TO LET SOMETHING. THAT THREE AGAINST TO FEL. METRICS A BIT OF A STRONG BUT OUTCOME OF BEATRIZ. FOR THANK YOU FOR THAT- WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT. OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES PROPOSAL ON THE DISCUSSION AGENDA. WE ARE NOW ON ISSUE FOR ON THE DIVISION OF COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE AND RESOLUTION PCP. WITH TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE WILL HAVE FOUR PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL BEGINNING WITH DIRECTOR NANCY PARCHMENT DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WHO.

PLEASE BE WHEN YOU ARE READY THANK YOU DR RANDY AND- THE COMMITTEES TIME TODAY TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT TO YOU. THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE- AS THE AGENDA CORRECTLY NOTES- THAT WE ARE PROPOSING A DIVISION OF COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE AND RESOLUTIONS. I'M IN THIS PROPOSAL WE ARE REQUESTING FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WITH TWENTY PERMANENT POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THIS ALSO INCLUDES- THE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE WITH THE AGREEMENT AND DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. SO AS WE KNOW THE BEST WAY THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE AND OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE. IS REALLY ENGAGING WITH THEM LISTENING TO WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT INITIATIVES. AND THIS IS ONE THAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN ABLE TO TAKE HAND IN HAND WITH OUR COMMUNITY OF OVER THE LAST YEAR TO UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE. SO WITH THIS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATE AND ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS. SO TO IMPROVE THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE THAT WE SERVE. THE NEW DIVISION WOULD ENABLE DDS TO CENTRALIZE THE CATHOLIC COMPLAINTS. AND RESOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN TIED TO THOSE COMPLAINTS AND THEN EMBRACING THE COLD LINGUISTICS SENSITIVITIES HAVE TRANSPARENCY. AND IN DOWN TREND THAT WE ARE SEEING IN OUR SYSTEM AND TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP POLICIES TO IMPROVE THOSE AS- THIS FOR. HAS TENTATIVE WOULD HAVE KEY COULD. THE FIRST IS- IMPROVING THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY COMPLAINTS- COMPLAINTS THAT ARE. REGARDING TO NILE CLIENT RIGHT- REFORMING OUR APPEALS AND OUR STATE HEARING PROCESS. SECOND WOULD BE ENHANCING THE DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE AND MEASURES. THIS WOULD BE THE AREA THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TIE. ALSO TO BE QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM. AND BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND STATEWIDE AND WITHIN EACH REGIONAL CENTER SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AS FAR AS MOVING TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY OUTCOMES. ALSO FOCUSING EFFORTS ON RISK MANAGEMENT IN SUPPORT OF CRITICAL INITIATIVES WE DO TRACK SPECIAL INCIDENT REPORTS WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO. BUT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A DESIGNATED AREA IN WHICH WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE ISSUES UNDERSTAND THE TRENDS AND DEVELOP RISK MANAGEMENT AND- PLANS TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS. LASTLY IS CREATING OMBUDSPERSON OFFICE THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE. SO WE'D LIKE TO THANK OUR SELF ADVOCATES AND FAMILIES THAT HAVE SHARED THE PERSONAL STORIES TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES. AND BE ABLE TO HELP US- REALLY DESIGN A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF OUR FAIR HEARING PROCESS ALSO WANT TO THANK HER COLLEAGUES OVER AT TGS THE DIRECTOR AND HER STAFF HAVE BEEN REMARKS. THINKING THIS.

OUTCOME FOCUSED. HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA QUESTIONS ONE THREE AND FOUR- ALL RELATE TO FAIR HEARING SO IF IT'S OKAY I'LL COVER THOSE FIRST AND THEN JUMP BACK TO NUMBER TWO. OF THE FIRST PART OF THE FIRST QUESTION ASKS ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT THE DEPARTMENT WENT THROUGH. APPRECIATE THE THOROUGH RIGHT UP IN THE AGENDA N THIS TOPIC STARTING ON PAGE FIFTEEN AND FIRST FULL PARAGRAPH DESCRIBES THAT A LITTLE BIT. BUT IT BUT IN SOME MORE DETAIL WE DID IS STARTING IN APRIL LAST YEAR CONVENE SIX DIFFERENT FOCUS GROUPS- WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDER. GROUPS WE- HE EQUITABLE ACCESS AND EQUITY CBO'S TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS- WITH FAMILY MEMBERS SELF ADVOCATES AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE STATE COUNCIL WE MET WITH FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS AND WE ABOUT WITH REGIONAL CENTERS ON THEIR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS- AND THEY'RE FAIR HEARING A COORDINATORS- WE ALSO MET SEPARATELY WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL OUTSIDE OF THOSE. ADDITIONALLY ON OCTTWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE- SURVEYED- ALL OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE THE HEARINGS PROCESS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS- AND- CONVENED AND- TWO SEPARATE FOLLOW UP FOCUS GROUPS WITH THEM AS WELL BASED ON THEIR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH US. AND THOSE ARE REALLY THAT- THE SOURCES- ADDITIONALLY- WE RECEIVED A REPORT DONE BY ADVOCATES ABOUT THE HEARING PROCESS THEY THEY WROTE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT REPORT AND WENT THROUGH THAT WITH US. SO WE HAD MULTIPLE SOURCES BEEN. UP TO THE UPPER DATES TO THE OVERALL APPEALS PROCESS NOT JUST THE HEARINGS THEMSELVES THAT CONTAINER APRIL ONE PROPOSAL. ON THE AGENDA IN THE SECOND HALF OF THAT QUESTION ASKED WHY WE CHOSE DGS- AS AS MY DIRECTOR ALLUDED TO WE HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM THE DIRECTOR OF DG ASSET AND HER TEAM.

BETTER FOR FAMILIES- WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE OF COURSE- MET THERE'S OBVIOUSLY EXPERTISE IN CONDUCTING HEARINGS IN MANY PLACES- IN THE ADMINISTRATION. BOTH DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDED INPUT TO OUR TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL- AND YOU SEE THAT REFLECTED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CASES SO- YOU KNOW AS A WHOLE OVERALL THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO MAKING THIS A BETTER PLACE AND- YOU KNOW. FRANKLY DANGERS OF THE MAGNITUDE PROPOSING COULD NOT HAPPEN JULY ONE ANYWAY AND WE THINK IT'S RIGHT TO GO AHEAD AND START WHERE THEY ARE AND TO APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT OF THE DGS TO PARTNER WITH US. TO MAKE THOSE THINGS A REALITY. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER ADAMS ITEMS AFTER THANK YOU SUNNY PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. S. SENATE PETTICOAT THE L. A- WE'VE REVIEWED THE PROPOSAL IN THE ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- THE PROPOSAL REALLY DOES TRY TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS. IN THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS- IMMEDIATELY WE DO NOT RAISE ANY CONCERNS BUT WILL CONTINUE TO GO OVER THE DETAILS AND COMMUNICATE WITH SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF- ON FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DENTIST REMEMBERS QUESTIONS I WILL KEEP IT HERE. WE HEARD ABOUT AN INDEPENDENT REPORT FROM STAKEHOLDERS OPENED OF FOLLOW UP WITH A LITTLE MORE DETAIL IF I CAN BUT WANTED TO SEE IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE THEIR REACTION TO THE DDS HEARINGS THUS FAR FROM THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY HOWEVER THEY- GAUGE WHAT'S IN THERE AND BUT LOOK FOR ALL OF US. SURE AND YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE REACTION TO PUZZLE YEP- OF THE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL WE'VE HAD PRIVATE BREEZED AND I LEAVING FOR THAT A LARGELY THEY SEEM THINGS THAT LIKE IT AND THEY SOME- WHERE. TURN FRANK AND- WE'VE TRIED TO DEFINE UNDER OF OUR TO WHAT THEY'LL WE MEANS- AND WE'VE- A PAST TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE WITH US- AND WE'VE SOLICITED- KIND OF LINE ITEM AT ITS IF YOU WILL AND THEMATIC THINGS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY TOLD US- FOR CONSIDERATION A ONE OF THE BIG MISSING THINGS IN OUR PROPOSAL AT THE MOMENT THAT WE KNOW NEEDS TO BE ADDED AND EXPECT TO HAVE DIALOGUE ON SPECIFICALLY- YOU'LL NOTICE THAT IN THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THERE IS NO. THERE ARE NO DATES AT ALL FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS. THE BILL IS ENACTED OF COURSE IT ALL BECOMES. EFFECTIVE JULY ONE. OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T CHANGE THE PROCESS WITHOUT EDUCATING PEOPLE ON WHAT THE NEW PROCESSES DEVELOPING THE FORMS. TRAINING THE STAFF CONDUCTING IT WILL DOING THE ALJ TRAINING SO SOME OF THE ROOF- PROPOSED UPDATES TO THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. NEED TO BE STAGGERED OVER TIME. AND SO FOR THAT REASON AS AN EXAMPLE- DIALOGUE REALLY NEEDS TO CONTINUE HERE AND WE'RE OPEN TO MAKING THIS A MUCH BETTER PROCESS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO. NEED AVAIL THEMSELVES OF IT. I'M ALONG THOSE LINES AND CONTINUING THE THEME OF EARLY. ISSUE BROUGHT UP. THE WHAT LATER MAKE SURE THAT PROPOSED CHANGES- THAT WE HAVE MEASURES THAT ARE. DETERMINING WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL OR NOT AND- SINCE WE DON'T HAVE TIME. DATA INCLUDED IN THE TRAILER BILL. WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE OUTCOMES WE WANT OUT OF THIS. WE'RE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE OF THE BILL PROCESS BEFORE- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SORRY BEFORE THE- THE BUDGETS AND ACTED SO WE HOPE TO PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY IN THAT REGARD- YOU YOU WILL ALSO SEE IN OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE FINAL- PROBABLY SIX OR EIGHT PAGES OF IT CONTAINED- SEVERAL. SUCH AS WHERE TALKING IT ON PARENTS SEE. THE INFORMATION THE PROCESS WHO'S USING IT WHO'S NOT USING IT WHO GOT RESOLVED AT WHAT STEP IN THE PROCESS AND THE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT WERE RESOLVED SO THERE ARE. SOME EXPAND COVERAGE OF THINGS OF WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT IN THE PROCESS THAT WILL HAVE STILL TATIAN. WHERE WHERE THERE ANY LESSONS LEARNED WHEN WE S. THE SELF DETERMINED. MMHM BUT- ARE. THAT CAN HELP US TO INFORM THE HEARING PRESSURING EFFORT THAT WE'RE DOING NOW HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT- THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IS A RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE SLICE SORRY OF THE OVERALL THING SO I WOULD SAY NOT NECESSARILY ACCEPT THAT I WOULD SAY WE KNOW THAT THAT DIRECT CONNECTION TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING A PROCESS. REALLY KEY TOWARD KNOWING HOW TO FIX IT AND REFORM AT. NOT SO THAT WOULD THAT WOULD KIND OF BE MY SHORT ANSWER TO THAT- THE OTHER THAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN RESOLVING ISSUES AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE LEVEL NOBODY WANTS TO GO TO A FORMAL HEARING WITH A JUDGE. ONE A SIMPLE CONVERSATION WITH THE REGIONAL SKINNER MIGHT RESOLVE THE ISSUE SO OUR PROPOSAL. REALLY OUTWEIGH VERY CLEARLY- INFORMAL MEETING PROCESS BEFORE MEDIA. AT ANY EVENT THANK YOU. AND THE FAMILY CAN CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE ANY COMBINATION OF THOSE OR ALL THREE OF THOSE. CHANGE THEIR MIND LATER IF THEY DON'T SEE THAT THEY'RE GETTING WHAT THEY WANT THEY CAN ALWAYS GO BACK AND SAY WELL WE TRIED THAT LET'S DO THIS NEXT SO. WE TRY TO ACCOMMODATE THAT FLEXIBILITY. IN AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT YOU HAD BECAUSE IF WE KEEP GROUNDING OURSELVES AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM THE PROGRAM WE'RE GOING TO BE DESIGNING BETTER PROGRAMS. ENOUGH WERE LOOKING TOWARDS THESE FAIR HEARINGS AND- DRAWING IN THE PURCHASE OF SERVICES WHICH WE KNOW. HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY A PROBLEM WITHIN OUR THE SYSTEM. I BELIEVE THAT BY GROUNDING OURSELVES IN THE STORIES AND- YEAH- EXPERIENCES. FROM OUR COMMUNITIES WILL BETTER ALLOW US TO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE WITH FAIR HEARINGS WILL ALLOW US TO. DRIVE BETTER PROCESS SEES BUT JUST SIMPLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE WERE GROUNDING OURSELVES AND THE PEOPLE ARE BENEFITING FROM THE PROGRAMS AND INCLUDING THEIR INPUT AND- MAKING CHANGES BECAUSE OF. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM.WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE ON THE RESEARCH AND DATA ENHANCEMENTS PCP WITH TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WE WILL HAVE FIVE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL FOR ISSUE FIVE BEGIN WITH CARLA CUSTOM YEAH THE- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. FOLLOWED BY PETE SERVING CO CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF DATA ANALYTICS AND STRATEGY WITH DDS. DR VICKY LOVELL CHIEF AUDITS AND RESEARCH WITH DDS. FOLLOWED BY CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. L. LET'S BEGIN WITH CARLA CASTANEDA. WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN PART BECAUSE THE OTHER DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES ON THIS REQUEST IS TO. DOLLARS TO BE HIRING NINETEEN STAFF TO SUPPORT OUR RESEARCH AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DIVISIONS. ON THIS INCREASES TO THREE POINT THREE MILLION ONGOING. OF THE AT THE INTENT IS TO ENHANCE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WOULD SUPPORT THE NEW AND CONTINUING INITIATIVES. THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES THE BILL AND LANGUAGE WOULD. PROVIDE I AM SPEND A THIRTY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT AND IMPLIED IN FOR. BUT IT ALSO- HOPES TO SEE OF PROVIDE BETTER- TRANSPARENCY FOR INFORMATION ONLINE FOR THE TOOL IS YOUR PARTS THANK YOU. MISTER SERVANT CONTROL. THANK YOU I THINK YOUR AGENDA ASK FOR SOME SPECIFIC TANGIBLE OUTCOMES- ASK DOCTOR LEVEL TO JUMP IN IN JUST A MOMENT- ON THAT POINT BUT I THINK TWO OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SYSTEM WIDE RALLY JUMP TO MIND HERE- THAT THE OF FIRST OF ALL- THE QUALITY INCENTIVE INITIATIVE- WHICH WHICH UNIVISION WHICH WOULD BE- STANDING UP AND REGIONAL CENTER PERFORMANCE MEASURES IS ANOTHER ONE. THESE EFFORTS REQUIRE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF DATA STRATIFIED IN A WAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT HERE TO FOUR HASN'T DONE IN A FREQUENCY THAT'S MORE THAT'S MORE REAL AND WALL YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE WORD CONSUMER IN EITHER OF THOSE THINGS BETTER PERFORMANCE AND BETTER QUALITY SERVICE IN THE HANDS OF THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE SO THOSE ARE TWO EXAMPLES WHERE DIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF THIS INVESTMENT IN OUR CAPACITY TO HANDLE THAT DATA. CONSUMER OUTCOMES- AND THAT'S WHAT WILL BE BETTER A SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND PERHAPS I COULD TURN IT TO DOCTOR LEVEL- TO CONTINUE TO ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION DR LEVEL CHIEF FOR THE FOR CORRECT. RESEARCH AUDIT AND EVALUATE BRANCH. FALLING ON ALL OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY WHAT THE PURPOSE F THE INITIATIVE THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDERTAKING- AND IN TERMS OF IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR CONSUMERS THAT ARE ALSO BEING VERY CLEAR ON WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES ARE. THIS EXPANSION WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE BASELINE SITUATION AND EXPERIENCE OF THE CONSUMER FACING OF THE CURRENT THING TODAY AT PARTICULARLY RELATED TO SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY WE DO HAVE A LOT. OF DATA AT A HIGH LEVEL- REGARDING OUR COUNTRY CONSUMERS EXPERIENCE THAT WE OFTEN DON'T CROWD MORE DETAILED INSIGHT BUT INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS THAT WE CAN AGGREGATE UP TO A LEVEL WHERE THAT INFORMATION IS USEFUL FOR POLICY AND PROGRAMS ENGINE. WE REALLY WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAPPENING ENHANCE DATA COLLECTION AND- BUDGET RELATED BALLOT OUTCOME IS THAT CONSUMERS THEMSELVES EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL GOALS FOR THE SERVICES THEY RECEIVE FROM THEIR- REGIONAL CENTERS. I WILL HAVE A BETTER A- AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON CONSUMER GOAL. WHICH WILL SUPPORT OUR HAVE TO ANNOUNCED- PERSON SAN AND OUT FOR. ON WITH THEM ABOUT GOALS AND SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. BEEN ABLE TO BETTER ADDRESS GAPS IN SERVICES THROUGH EXPANDED DATA COLLECTION AND BETTER DATA QUALITY MORE TIMELY DATA UPDATES AND MORE DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF BARRIERS THAT ARE FACED A WE CAN DEVELOP APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER OUT ON THE SIDE OF MR THANK YOU SUNNY PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. FUNNY PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. O. THERE IS ONE COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT CONCERNS A REPORT THAT WOULD BE SAID THAT IS SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE- THAT CONCERNS CHILDREN WHO ARE DUALLY SUIT SERVED BY THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. M. BY DDS- THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING TO INSTEAD OF SUBMITTING THIS REPORT TO MORE REGULARLY POST DATA ONLINE. AND- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- REPORTING ON A PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE GROUP OF CHILDREN IS OBVIOUSLY QUITE IMPORTANT BUT IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE USEFUL AND PROVIDED TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME. HAVING DDS AND SOCIAL SERVICES JOINT WE POST INFORMATION ON THEIR WEBSITES FOR PUBLIC AND LEGISLATIVE REVIEW DOES INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE STILL NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS INFORMATION SO ONE POSSIBLE COMPROMISE OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IT BEING THE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE. BILL NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE WHEN DATA UPDATES ARE MADE- AND POSTED ONLINE. AND THEN- ACTUALLY THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER HAVING THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE SPESSART OF DISTILL IMPORTANT FINDINGS FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO PERHAPS THAT COULD BE THROUGH THE OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION OR PERHAPS THEY COULD OFFER. BRIEFINGS TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF WERE PERHAPS THERE'S ANOTHER MEANS- THAT COULD BE BRAINSTORMED- IN ADDITION- WE'D IN CLOSING NOTE THAT GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT HAS PASSED SINCE THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT WAS FIRST CODIFIED. THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR BENEFIT FROM ANY CHANGES TO THE REQUIREMENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE PERHAPS IT WOULD BENEFIT FROM GETTING MORE INFORMATION FROM THE TWO DEPARTMENTS ABOUT OUTCOMES FOR THE CHILDREN WHO ARE DULY SERVED BY THE TWO DEPARTMENTS- IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY REPORTED ON. LIKE BASIC NUMBERS OF KIDS AND- SORT OF PROCESS ORIENTED TYPE MEASURES. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE D√çAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS- FIRST OLD ALL STAR JUST BY SAYING HOW INTERESTED MY OFFICE IS IN. BOTH COLLECTION OF DATA AND THEN THE ANALYSIS THAT COMES WITH IT AS- THAT WHICH IS NOT MEASURED CANNOT BE IMPROVED. AND SOME VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS WILLING TO. TACKLE THIS AND TO START ASKING AND ANSWERING SOME OF THE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. BUT WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THE REPORTING IF I CAN AS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REPORTED BUT THAT IT'S MEANINGFUL- IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO BOTH BE NOTIFIED AND OR GET A SUMMARY OF- WHAT THE DATA IS SHOWING HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT WERE INCLUDED AS YOU'RE SUBMITTING THAT INFORMATION. ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE WHOLE POINT OF THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION IS TO INFORM PUBLIC POLICY AND THAT IS NOT JUST THE ADMINISTRATION BUT THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL. WE DON'T ENVISION POSTING STATIC DATA TABLES- THERE WITH NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT IT MEANS AND WHAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER AS A RESULT. UP BITS OF THAT ARE IN THE CURRENT FORMAL REPORT THAT'S THAT'S PRODUCED- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WITH THEIR OPPORTUNITIES THERE TO MAKE THAT BOTH MORE USEFUL AS THE L. A. O. SUGGESTED. AND MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC THAN THAN IT'S CURRENTLY DONE AND SO THAT'S A VERY CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENT. LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION COULD CAN HAPPEN WE MEET WITH YOUR TEAM DOES STAFF QUARTERLY WE CAN TELL THEM WHEN THE WEBSITES UPDATED THIS. HAVING TO PHD IS A MY OFF SAID- AND HAVE. RESEARCH BACKGROUNDS ALSO A THIS TO BE ON ALLOWS OUR UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCHERS TO BE FOLLOWING AND GATHERING THIS INFORMATION WHICH IS NECESSARY SO ONCE TO THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION PROPOSALS. WE WILL START ON ISSUE SIX ON THE DISABILITY INNOVATION FUND BCP WE WILL HAVE FOUR PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL FOR ISSUE SIX BEGINNING WITH JOSIE BEER DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION TRONG LEAD ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION EMPLOYMENT DIVISION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION.

ACTUALLY SERVES THE FIRST NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE OF THIS GRANT AND NORMALLY WHEN IT DEPARTMENT RECEIVES. ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS FINANCE WOULD NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH WHAT IS CALLED A SECTION TWENTY EIGHT LETTER- TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDED THROUGH ALREADY IN THE CURRENT YEAR HOWEVER IN THIS INSTANCE AT D. O. R. HAD SUFFICIENT FEDERAL FUNDS A THIRTY IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND DID NOT NEED ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY AND THEREFORE A SECTION TWENTY EIGHT LETTER WAS NOT EXPLICITLY NECESSARY BUT WE STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAD THE PROPER NOTIFICATION- BUT WITH UNFORTUNATELY BEGAN. REVIEWING THIS REQUEST AT CLOSE TO THE TIMELINE FOR APRIL BCPS AND MADE THE DECISION TO- NOTIFY THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATURE OF THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IN THE BUDGET YEAR- IN THAT THIS GRANT PROVIDES- THROUGH THIS B. C. PIECE OF THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT IT. FIND ABOUT THIS BUT JUST WANTED TO PER SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THAT. THANK Q. SENATE PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. I THANK YOU WE'VE RIVER THE PROPOSAL AND DO NOT HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS AND MISTER BAKER ADDRESSED- ONE OF OUR SORT OF PRACTICAL. CONCERNS THANK YOU GREAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE D√çAS FOR ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS AND KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR I'M WOULD LIKE TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF SCOPE HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING ARE ARE EXPECTED TO BE SERVED BY THIS PROJECT AND- OVER WHAT TIME FRAME AND AGAIN. HOW WILL WE BE MEASURING RESULTS- WILL THERE BE METRICS AND OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING AND OW WILL THESE BE COMMUNICATED WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON A REGULAR BASIS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION UP ALL START THIS OFFER THEN KICK IT OVER TO MISTER LEE. SO LET LET ME START WITH THE EVALUATION PART- FIRST SO THIS IS OF COURSE I'M A FIVE YEAR GRANTS A FEDERAL GRANT AND THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF THAT GRANT A FORMAL EVALUATION. FROM IS- REQUIRED. AND SO WE WILL BE PREPARING THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY CONTRACTED WITH- ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES TO CONDUCT THAT EVALUATION. CERTAINLY MAKING THAT AVAILABLE. TO THE LEGISLATURE IS WHAT NOT AN ISSUE AT ALL- BUT KNOWING THAT THAT REALLY IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE IN YOUR FIVE OR SIX- WE DO HAVE- ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW FORMATIVE THOSE WOULD BE BUT CERTAINLY GLAD TO. COME BACK IN AND SHARE- ANY UPDATES OR ANYTHING IS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED IN THE INTERVENING YEARS WORTH OF THE LEGISLATURE- SO. OPEN TO THAT- I THINK IN TERMS OF. THE ACTUAL VOLUME PARTICIPANTS REPORT TALKING SOMEWHERE AROUND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED THIS IS STATEWIDE- AND IS TRONG MENTIONED EARLIER IN. THE APPLICATION ITSELF IN THE IN THE GRANT ITSELF THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DATA ELEMENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE COLLECTED.

NO I'M I'M IN CREDIBLY ENCOURAGED. BY THE- RECEIPT OF THESE FUNDS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK THE REASON WHY I'M ASKING FOR THE FOLLOW UP ON METRICS IS. THAT I'M ANTICIPATING US TO HAVE GOOD RESULTS FROM THIS INNOVATION FUND AND IF WERE HAVING THOSE RESULTS PRIOR TO THE- COMPLETION OF THE GRANT FUNDING AND THE EVALUATION IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS A LEGISLATURE SO WE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER WE- NEEDED TO INCREASE.

SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO OPIOID USE- WE PLANNED IT OUT THIS TRAINING COMPANY HOPE CAN BE CORPORATE AS PART OF A HOLISTIC RECOVERY APPROACH. THE TRAINING WILL FOCUS ON INCORPORATING THE FULL RANGE OF VOCATIONAL RELOCATION SERVICES INTO A PARTICIPANT'S TREATMENT IT'S PART OF A WHOLE PERSON APPROACH TO RECOVERY. TO DEVELOP AND PROVIDE SUPPORTS FOR INDIVIDUALS RETURNING TO OUR TRANSITION INTO WORK DURING AND FOLLOWING TREATMENT. STILL VERY MUCH IN CONCERT WITH THE BELIEF THAT EMPLOYMENT CAN AND SHOULD E AN INTEGRAL PART OF AND CAN ENHANCE THE RECOVERY PROCESS AND NOT BE SOMETHING THAT IS POSTPONED UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF TREATMENT. YOUR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND A MINIMUM OF FOUR TREATMENT CENTERS BY COMPLICATING STAFF IN THE SELECTED CENTERS. THAT ARE TREATING DIVERSE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. PARTICULARLY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED SEVERE AND DISPARATE IMPACT FROM THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC EMPLOYMENT SKILLS DEVELOPMENT COUNSELING GUIDANCE ON EMPLOYMENT OPTIONS JOB PLACEMENT IN ADVOCACY FOR. AN IDENTIFICATION OF LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTS THE PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RELATED TO OPIATE USE MAY REQUIRE TO BE SUCCESSFUL THE WORKPLACE.

A- OUR MAIN COMMENT- SORT OF REPEATS A THEME THAT'S BEEN COMMON THROUGHOUT THIS- HEARING TODAY AND THAT IS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT AS HAS NOT WORKED OUT YET HOW WOULD YOU EVALUATE THIS NOVEL PILOT PROGRAM TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S SUCCESSFUL AND SHOULD BE REPLICATED IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. I'M IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT- THEY INDICATED THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS BUT WE JUST NOTE THAT AS WRITTEN THE PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE ANY EVALUATIONS THAT GUARANTEE FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN- WE THINK THIS WOULD BE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY AND SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE- CONSIDER ADDING SUCH REQUIREMENTS. WE'LL BRING IT NOW UP TO THE DIGESTIVE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS AND KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT IF I CAN IN RESPONSE TO. THE L. A- HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON HOW WE WILL BE EVALUATING THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE TIMELINE THAT WE HAVE FOR PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. AND WHEN WE CAN EXPECT THIS PROGRAM TO BEGIN OPERATING. SO ALL START THAT NON GERMAN SO WITH THE WITH THE EVALUATION WILL CLEARLY WILL BE DOING AN EVALUATION HERE IS MUCH BETTER BECAUSE AS NOTED- EARNING HER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE WANTING TO ENSURE IS WHAT NOT JUST MEASURING TO TASK AND ACTIVITY HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE OUR HOW MANY SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. BUT REALLY MEASURING WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE SERVICES ON OF THE INDIVIDUAL. CHAU AS AN EXAMPLE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE A WIN FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT- MATE. WAIT AND COME BACK AT A LATER POINT IN SO THAT PATH THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRAVEL IS NOT GOING TO BE A LANDING GEAR AND SO WE- NOT ONLY DO WE WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT THOSE. MEASURES ARE GOING TO BE OF THAT IMPACT BUT BUT AS WE'RE WORKING WITH- THE TREATMENT PARTNERS WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INCLUDING THEM IN THAT CONVERSATION. SO WE WILL. DEFINITELY BE EVALUATING THIS AND CERTAINLY. SHARING THAT- BACK WITH THE LEGISLATURE GLAD TO DO SO AND MCCARTY YOUR TRADITIONAL DETAILS THE- RIGHT. THANK YOU DIRECTORS EVER AS AS DIRECTORS EVER NOTED- WE ARE PROPOSING TO COLLECT IN AND OUT AND ANALYZE DATA THE TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES EFFORTS TO SUPPORTS TRAINING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS.

THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO EMPLOYER THE RESOLUTION OF TREATMENT SERVICES AND THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DROP OUT OR DISCONTINUE PLUMBING SERVICES WHILE IN TREATMENT AND AFTER TREATMENT- WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE- TRACKING THE RECIPIENT OR GRAPHIC DATA. WHEN. IT'S PROVIDED BY THE TREATMENT PARTNER. DESTRUCTOR EXAM NO NO YOU KNOW OF INCOME NATURE OF SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT PARTICULARLY THOSE FIRST ENTERING INTO WERE SEEKING TREATMENT. AND MULTIPLE CO OCCURRING DISABILITIES AND INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS RELATED TO OPIOID USE. WE WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT SETTING PROJECTED QUALIFICATIONS. THERE MENTION WE DON'T WANT TO MEASURE TASK AN ACTIVITY WE WANT TO MEASURE OUTCOMES. INSTANCE THIS IS NEW WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE GOALS ARE REALISTIC AND REFLECT THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THE SERVICES. THEREFORE WE WILL NEED TO WORK WITH THE TREATMENT CENTERS AND THEIR STAFF TO JOIN ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE MEANS AND TARGETS TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF SERVICES ON OUTCOMES. WE'RE EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN AND OUT AND- EAGER. TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THESE SERVICES AND- EXPAND. THEM WHEN- POSSIBLE. IN REGARDS TO THE CHAIRS- RELAY TIMELINE- GONNA BE ONE OF BE ONE MAKE SURE THAT TRAINING IS DEVELOP CONTRACTS WITH THE CHEN TRAINING THAT WILL BE OFFERED TO THE PROVIDER.

IS THE TREATMENT CENTER IT IT'S SERVING A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF A TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION. IS THE CENTER LOCATED IN AND SERVING A COMMUNITY THAT'S JUST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE OPIOID CRISIS. DO THE SENATE LOCATIONS REPRESENT A VARIETY AND REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT LANDSCAPE FOR EXAMPLE RURAL VERSUS URBAN ECONOMIES. COMES AS HIGH TECH OF THE ECONOMIES- REPRESENTING VERY DIFFERENT TO THE WORK FORCE AND A DIFFERENT METHOD OF EMPLOYMENT AS AN AGRICULTURAL OR A- IN. REGENT THAT'S FOCUSED ON LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION- WE'RE ALSO SEEKING THE CENTERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN INNOVATION AND THAT THEY'RE OPEN TO PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU ARE TO ENSURE THAT WHAT FULL PLAN AS A PART OF THE INITIATIVE. AS NOTED WE ARE SEEKING TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFICACY OF INCLUDING APARTMENTS SERVICES PART OF RECOVERYAND EFFORT WE WANT. TO SELECT LOCATIONS THERE TOO SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER. AND AS YOU NOTED TO CRITICS ALSO SERVE THOSE THAT ARE MOST IN NEED SO WE REALLY ARE- NOT BEING DELIBERATE THE FIRST TWO WILL BE SELECTED AT IN IN CONSULTATION AND WORK WITH THE WITH THE- SERVICE COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS THE SECOND TWO- THE IDEA OUT- AS YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SERVING A BROAD RANGE OF COMMUNITIES AND CONSERVE. THEM AND SIMILAR LOOKING.

BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE SOME REMARKS AS WELL FROM YANG LEAVE THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ON BEHALF OF. DIRECTOR KIM JOHNSON MISTER LEAGUE CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. SURE THANK YOU. ELEVEN WITH THE CHURCH AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS YANG LEE AND I'M THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF DEPARTMENTS THOSE RESOURCES IT'S MY PLEASURE UP THANK YOU FOR ACTION HAPPINESS HERE AND PRESENTING ON ITS PROPOSALS IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF DIRECTED JOHNSON TO OPEN UP THE CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR APRIL ONE FINANCE LETTERS. OUT WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR AFTER THIS PAST YEAR IN PARTNERSHIP THE LEGISLATURE WE NEVER EXPAND OUT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAD ADINA BRESGE THE FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW FOR NEW PROGRAMS AND NEW FUNNY OVER UNVESTED CENTER DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THAT'S DOING A LOT OF GREAT STUFF FOR OUR CLIENTS. WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE CAN BE. WELL IT. OPERATIONAL NEEDS AN ARGUMENT SEVENTIES BURKE- MYSTERY PROSTHESES. AND LOT OF BEHIND THE PARK SCENES OVERALL SO. THESE PROPOSES THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU ARE REALLY CRITICAL FOR DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT AND ADMINISTER PROGRAMS. AND TO PROVIDE GOOD SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS- MY COLLEAGUES. FROM THE DEPARTMENT AVAIL ONLINE SO THEY COULD. PRESENT ON THE PROPOSAL AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR DOWN THE CONVERSATIONS OVERALL. TWENTY THANKED FOR THAT- SO WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH YOU MENTIONED WITH TARANTULA AND YOU CAN PRESENT ON THE FIRST. ISSUE SANFORD THANK YOU. RIGHT TO LOOK. YEAH YOU MIGHT HAVE. MISTER JULY YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR MICROPHONE MUTED. THE DIFFICULT CAN HEAR YOU NOW. OKAY GREAT- SO- RANCH LET WITH THE RESEARCH AUTOMATION AND DATA DIVISION- I'M GOING TO BE PRESENTING ABOUT THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE T. THAT SPECIAL BASKET OR SO CDS THAT'S IT'S REQUESTING ONE FULL TIME PERMANENT SUPERVISING SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR TO FULL TIME PERMANENT SPECIAL INVESTIGATORS AND ONE FULL TIME PERMANENT HEPA TO COMBAT EVER INCREASING THIRD PARTY E. T. APPS AS WELL AS OTHER POTENTIAL PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FRAUD IS NOT BEING INVESTIGATED CURRENTLY DUE TO. LACK OF RESOURCES STATEWIDE. RECIPIENTS OF HEALTH QUESTION HOW WORKS RECEIVED THEIR FOOD AND CASH BENEFITS ON EBT CARDS WHICH CAN THEN BE USED AT ATMS AND OTHER POINT OF SALE DEVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. RECENTLY WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THIRD PARTY THAT THE B. B. T. BENEFITS THROUGH- TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADEPT- SKIMMING AND SCAMMING. SKIMMING IS A FORM OF ELECTRONIC THEFT IN WHICH ABOLISHES ACTOR PLACES THAT DEVICE ON APPOINTED CIRCLE A POINT OF SALE TERMINAL. THAT CAPTURES THE CARD INFORMATION ON CARDS THAT ARE SCANNED AT THAT TERMINAL. AND SCANNING THE KURDS WHEN ABOLISHES ACTOR USES SOCIAL ENGINEERING- TO MANIPULATE CARDHOLDERS INTO DISCLOSING THEIR INFORMATION. IN BOTH INSTANCES THE MALICIOUS ACTOR CAN THEN USE THAT CARD INFORMATION TO CREATE A CLONE CARD IN DROUGHT ON BENEFITS- OFF WITH THE RIGHTFUL CARDHOLDERS ACCOUNT. OKAY PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS A THIRD PARTY THAT. HAS INCREASED FROM ABOUT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND PER MONTH- OVERSTATE FISCAL YEARS NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE- TO SOMETHING CLOSER TO THE TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLAR RANGE PER MONTH OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. CURRENT STATUTES IN PARTICULAR AB TWENTY THIRTY FIVE IN AB TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN MANDATE THAT THE STATE REPLACE BENEFITS THAT WERE STOLEN BY ELECTRONIC MEANS. SUCH AS SKIMMING AD SCAMMING- AND RESULTING CASH REIMBURSEMENTS ARE PAID OUT OF STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. IN ADDITION PUT THAT REIMBURSEMENTS WERE ADDED DUE TO THE OUTCOMES OF YOUR TAKEOVERS JOHNSON PARK FINDINGS AND ARE ALSO PAID FROM STATE GENERAL FUND. WHILE THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS ARE NOT AS HIGH AS THE CASH SIDE AFTER THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO GROWING. THAT PROPOSED POSITIONS ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT AND DETER THE THEFT OF EBT BENEFITS FROM VULNERABLE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WILL PROVIDE CSS WITH DEDICATED ABILITY TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND COORDINATE WITH OTHER. LOCAL AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS THESE RESOURCE IS WHAT ALLOWS CSS TO ADDRESS THE INCREASE IN UNITY THEFT IN THE CALFRESH EMPOWERS PROGRAMS. COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES. AND PROTECT. RECIPIENTS WERE BEING VICTIMIZED EXPERIENCING LOTS OF BENEFITS. THE STOCK MONITOR INVESTIGATE AND SUPPORT PROSECUTION OF THIRD PARTY EVEN TO TALK TO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FUNDS AT THE STATE LEVEL.ALSO RECEIVING ADDITIONAL PREVENTIVE MEASURES MEASURES TO REDUCE FUTURE ACTIVITIES. TAKE ME QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR JENNY DR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I OPINION DR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE L. L. RYAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE REVIEWED THIS PROPOSAL AND I HAVE NO CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DENTIST TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS- FOR MR GILLETTE IF I CAN I'M HOPING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THE THEFT PHENOMENON WHICH WE ARE EXPERIENCING. AS WELL A HOW THE RESOURCES IN THE P. C. P. WILL BE SET UP TO XXL FULLY BATTLE THIS SITE- NOTICED THAT THE PROPOSAL IS FOR LESS THAN WE ARE- LOSING WITHIN A GIVEN MONTH. AS A COST FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR WONDERING IF WE'RE AT THE RIGHT CARE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMBATING THIS EFFECTIVELY. YEAH SO GREAT QUESTION- WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE AND WE IN FACT THAT AS I MENTIONED- WE ARE STILL TRYING TO INVESTIGATE EXACTLY. WHY THIS IS HAPPENING- YEAH WE HAVE SOME THEORIES BUT- INVESTIGATES AND INVESTIGATIONS ARE ONGOING SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD TO SAY AT THIS POINT. OUR BEST GUESS IS THAT IN THE PAST IS THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN PURSUED BY. INDIVIDUAL ACTORS- AND- THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE NOW THAT THERE MIGHT BE. ORGANIZED IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE ORGANIZATION IT'S HAPPENING BEHIND IT WITH NO. PRIME BRAKES THAT ARE THEY'RE GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS WORK. WE ARE PURSUING A NUMBER STRATEGIES TO COMBAT UP ON THE FRONT END- SO FOR EXAMPLE WERE PLANNING TO ROLL OUT A NEW CARD VERIFICATION VALUE CVT TECHNOLOGY- ON EBT CARDS- NEXT MONTH WHICH SHOULD. BOTH BE SUBSTANTIALLY DOWN ON THE- SIDE OF THINGS- AND WE'RE ALSO THINKING ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN USE. THAT DATA THAT WE HAV ON CARD USAGE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY WHERE SOME OF THOSE SKIMMING DEVICES MAYBE. AND ALSO GLEANING INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED FOR INVESTIGATORS TO GO OUT AND PURSUE THOSE LEADS AND TRY TO TRACK DOWN SOME OF THE- PERPETRATORS OF THESE CRIMES- THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY BENEFICIAL. BECAUSE CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES ON THE STATE. SIDE PURSUE WORK BEST IT. RUSTICATED STOP I'M TO GO AND CONDUCT THOSE THOSE- INVESTIGATIONS WHERE WHERE THE TOPIC. AND SO THIS IS BECOMING MORE THAT IT IS THE STATE ISSUE IT CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF THERE ARE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES THAT- YOU KNOW SOMEONE HAS THEIR BENEFITS AS SOMEONE WHO IS A CARD HOLDER AND I LOS ANGELES HAS THEIR BENEFITS STOLEN BUT THEN DRAWN DOWN FROM AN ACCOUNT EXPECT IS THAT WOULD BE SITUATIONAL DEDICATED STATE RESOURCES WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PURSUE MORE OF THOSE LEADS IDENTIFY A MORE- ABOUT MALICIOUS ACTORS AND HOPEFULLY GET SOME ARRESTS THAT WOULD CUT DOWN ON ON FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M- I DO WANT TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT AS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE STRENGTHENING THE PROGRAM WHEN WE HAVE THIS THEFT OCCURRING- WE ARE THEN NOT HAVING CALFRESH DOLLARS GOING TOWARDS THEIR DESIGNATED. PURPOSE OF ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY AND SO I THINK THE REASON OR RATIONALE FOR MY QUESTIONING IS REALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO. PURSUE ENOUGH TO CURTAIL THE SENATE THIS IN THE BUD AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M ASKING OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS IN LIGHT OF. US HAVING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. IS THIS THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES FOR US TO STOP THIS AND NIP THIS IN THE BUD OR WILL YOU. NEED MORE IN THE FUTURE I WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT HONEST. CONVERSATION TODAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING- THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM HEAD ON. COMMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THIS- THE BUDGET REQUEST. ABSOLUTELY- SO. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ARE PURSUING OTHER EFFORTS TO ADD SUCH AS THE CVV VALUE ADD- YOU KNOW THESE OTHER SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS THAT THIS THIS IS ONE PART OF BROADER EFFORTS THAT ARE THAT ARE UNDER WAY- YOU KNOW WE DO BELIEVE THAT AT THIS POINT- ASKED THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATIVE STAFF- WHAT. WOULD BE. SUFFICIENT FOR THE ISLAND IS THAT WE'VE SEEN- BUT WOULD ALSO ADD THAT WE ARE PURSUING ADDITIONAL FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMS LIKE SNAP. I'M TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. OTHER FUNDING STREAMS ARE OUT THERE TO HELP INCREASE THAT- YEP OF THESE PROGRAMS. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US IS THE LEGISLATURE TO GET AN UPDATE PRIOR TO NEXT YEAR TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT- WE ARE BEING EFFECTIVE WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE'VE ALLOCATED HOW WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME. FOR US TO CHECK BACK IN TO SEE IF WE ARE. MAKING A SIGNIFICANT DENT ON THIS. YES WE CAN ABSOLUTELY PROVIDE YOU WITH REGULAR UPDATES ON- THE FAX NUMBER IS SENT AND IF WE'RE SEEING A DECLINE- WE WOULD HOPE THAT AS- MORE OF THESE- EFFORTS IN IN RESOURCES COME ONLINE WE WOULD START TO SEE A- HOPEFULLY PRETTY. STEEP DECLINE IN OUR ANNUAL IN OUR MONTHLY SEPTEMBER'S- SO WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT WITH. WHATEVER PRECONCEIVED LIKE WOULD YOU EXPECT THAT WITHIN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS OR SIX MONTHS TO SEE THAT SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE BECAUSE THAT. WOULD THEN BE THE APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME FOR US TO ASK FOR THAT INFORMATION BACK AND- WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT- YOU THINK IS WHAT YOU WOULD BE AMENABLE TO. I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT SIX MONTHS WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD POINT TO CHECK IN I'M AT THAT POINT WE SHOULD HAVE THE IT SEEMS TO BE TECHNOLOGY- IN PLACE AND- YOU ASSUMING THAT THE PC RESOURCES- COME ONLINE. HOW LEADS UNDER WAY AND THAT HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR THAT- SO CAN DEFINITELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL THINK THIS ENTIRE PANEL- MR LEE DOT PROGRAM BUT JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO HIRING STAFF TO TAKE SALUTE AWHILE TO BRING PEOPLE ON TRAINING THEM TO A- SIX MONTH IS A GOOD WAY FOR TO CHECK IN WITH YOU.

JACKIE PRESS ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST SAYS AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION REGARDING THIS PROPOSED BILL.

WAITING TO HEAR BACK ON SOME OF THE REASONS WHY. WE MAY BE DOING THE FAVOR OF UNEASE TO BE DECLINING- BT ALSO THAT RAISES BIGGER. LARGER CONCERNS AROUND THE SELF SUFFICIENCY OF THE FUND IF WE ARE SEEING THAT REVENUES ARE DECLINING. SO IT ENDED TO HER FOLLOW UP WE ALSO POSED A SO ASK THE FEASIBILITY. BROTHER IN FOR IN THE LONG RUN EVAN THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH PROJECTS. NOT NOW WITH AVENUES WILL ACT COME AND LOW- AS IN ALL. PAUSING PAYMENTS WERE WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST ON.
