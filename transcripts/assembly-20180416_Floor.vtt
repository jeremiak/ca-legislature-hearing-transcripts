00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.970 region:rollup2
AUSCHWITZ WAS THIS IS A WORD

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:54.938 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:57.274 region:rollup2
GENOCIDE. AND YET THEY DIDN'T

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:58.709 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT IT MEANT.

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.910 region:rollup2
ELEVEN PERCENT OF AMERICANS SAID

00:52:58.709 --> 00:53:02.179 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO HOLD NEO

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:04.048 region:rollup2

00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:07.084 region:rollup2
AS WE ALL KNOW. LAST YEAR OUR

OWN PRESIDENT.

00:53:07.084 --> 00:53:10.654 region:rollup2
REFUSED TO CONDEMN A NEO*

00:53:09.153 --> 00:53:12.523 region:rollup2
MARCH THAT LEAD TO DEATH IN THIS

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:13.424 region:rollup2
COUNTRY AND EVEN SAID THAT SOME

00:53:12.523 --> 00:53:14.992 region:rollup2
OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GOOD

00:53:13.424 --> 00:53:16.460 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:53:14.992 --> 00:53:18.829 region:rollup2
WHAT'S WORSE IS THE NUMBER OF A

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.230 region:rollup2
PROMINENT AMERICAN POLITICIANS

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:22.499 region:rollup2
AND THOUGHT LEADERS TO REFUSE TO

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:25.803 region:rollup2
STAND UP. AND PUBLICLY CONDEMNED

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:27.271 region:rollup2
THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT.

00:53:25.803 --> 00:53:27.771 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME AS AMERICANS

00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:29.006 region:rollup2
ARE FORGETTING ABOUT THE

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:30.074 region:rollup2
HOLOCAUST

00:53:29.006 --> 00:53:31.575 region:rollup2
THE FEBRUARY REPORT FROM THE

00:53:30.074 --> 00:53:32.910 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER SHOW

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:34.344 region:rollup2
THAT THE NUMBER OF HATE GROUPS

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:36.246 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES. HAS

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:38.582 region:rollup2
INCREASED BY TWENTY PERCENT IN

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:40.551 region:rollup2
THE PAST THREE YEARS.

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:41.785 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF NEO* GROUPS

00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:43.253 region:rollup2
HAS INCREASED FROM NINETY NINE

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:44.621 region:rollup2
AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TWO

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:46.156 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE AND TWO

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:48.358 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN.

00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:49.293 region:rollup2
MEMBERS MANY OF THOSE GROUPS ARE

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:51.829 region:rollup2
HEADQUARTERED RIGHT HERE IN

00:53:49.293 --> 00:53:52.963 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:56.066 region:rollup2
WE EVEN SEE THE UGLY FACE OF

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:56.567 region:rollup2
ANTI SEMITISM SHOWN PUBLICLY ON

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:58.469 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES IN

00:53:56.567 --> 00:53:59.837 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:00.971 region:rollup2
HOW MANY AMERICANS THINK THAT

00:53:59.837 --> 00:54:02.506 region:rollup2
HITLER ROSE TO POWER THROUGH

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:04.441 region:rollup2
FORCE THAT IT WASN'T OVER THROW

00:54:02.506 --> 00:54:06.343 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF MILITARY COUP IN

00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:06.910 region:rollup2
GERMANY BUT IT WASN'T?

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.645 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.547 region:rollup2
REMEMBER.

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:12.483 region:rollup2
HITLER CAME TO POWER THROUGH A

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:13.684 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATIC ELECTION.

00:54:12.483 --> 00:54:15.319 region:rollup2
IN A COUNTRY THAT WAS ONE OF THE

00:54:13.684 --> 00:54:17.187 region:rollup2
MOST EDUCATED AND AT THE TIME

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:19.656 region:rollup2
SOCIALLY PROGRESSIVE NATIONS ON

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:20.691 region:rollup2
EARTH.

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:23.260 region:rollup2
HE DIDN'T COME TO POWER ON A

00:54:20.691 --> 00:54:25.062 region:rollup2
PLATFORM OF MASS MURDER NO.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.630 region:rollup2
HE VERY INSIDIOUSLY

00:54:25.062 --> 00:54:28.365 region:rollup2
BEGAN TO A ROAD THE CIVIL

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:30.134 region:rollup2
LIBERTIES IN GERMANY.

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:31.735 region:rollup2
TURN THE POPULATION AGAINST ONE

00:54:30.134 --> 00:54:34.138 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BY MARGINALIZING

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:36.140 region:rollup2
MINORITY POPULATIONS.

00:54:34.138 --> 00:54:39.710 region:rollup2
TO WILL ALLOW THOSE RATES TO BE

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:41.712 region:rollup2
ERODED OVER TIME.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:43.113 region:rollup2
IT WAS HIS POPULIST VIEWS.

00:54:41.712 --> 00:54:46.717 region:rollup2
AND THAT STRATEGY OF

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:48.352 region:rollup2
MARGINALIZING CITIZENS.

00:54:46.717 --> 00:54:49.319 region:rollup2
AND TURNING CITIZENS AGAINST ONE

00:54:48.352 --> 00:54:50.454 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND AGAINST THEIR

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.455 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORS THAT LED TO THE

00:54:50.454 --> 00:54:53.157 region:rollup2
HOLOCAUST.

00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:54.925 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES

00:54:53.157 --> 00:54:56.126 region:rollup2
WE MUST STAND AGAINST THESE

00:54:54.925 --> 00:54:58.328 region:rollup2
KINDS OF TACTICS WHEN WE SEE

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:59.730 region:rollup2
THEM IN OUR MYTHS.

00:54:58.328 --> 00:55:03.634 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE A CURRENT FEDERAL

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:04.968 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THAT DE THAT. THAT.

00:55:03.634 --> 00:55:07.070 region:rollup2
HOLD ON TO POWER AND TRIES TO

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:09.973 region:rollup2
GAIN POWER BY MARGINALIZING

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:11.708 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF OUR OWN SOCIETY.

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:13.477 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION.

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:15.846 region:rollup2
SIX A DENIED BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS

00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:17.748 region:rollup2
BASED ON PEOPLE'S GENDER THEIR

00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:20.150 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THEIR RACE

00:55:17.748 --> 00:55:21.985 region:rollup2
THEIR RELIGION.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.554 region:rollup2
TO DEPORT OUR RESIDENTS IN THE

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:26.456 region:rollup2
DEAD OF NIGHT TO SEPARATE

00:55:23.554 --> 00:55:30.160 region:rollup2
FAMILIES FROM THEIR CHILDREN.

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:31.995 region:rollup2
WE MUST STAND OUT AGAINST THAT.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.864 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN POLAND THE LAW WAS

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:35.465 region:rollup2
PASSED JUST RECENTLY.

00:55:33.864 --> 00:55:36.834 region:rollup2
THAT MADE IT A CRIMINAL OFFENSE

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:37.901 region:rollup2
TO IMPLY THAT THE POLISH

00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:39.369 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT OR EVEN POLISH

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:43.807 region:rollup2
CITIZENS WERE IN ANY WAY

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:46.009 region:rollup2
COMPLICIT. IN THE HOLOCAUST.

TRUTH AND WE HAVE TO STAND IN

00:55:52.149 --> 00:55:56.286 region:rollup2
SOLIDARITY WITH THEM.

00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:58.121 region:rollup2
