VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS AND SOME

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.122
OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:46.557
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS BY ICE.

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:48.359
DEFEND OUR COMMUNITIES WE MUST

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:49.727
RECOGNIZE THAT THE IMMIGRATION

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:50.928
COURT ROOMS IN OUR STATE WERE

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.263
TODAY SO MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:54.498
STAND ALONE ARE ACTUALLY THE

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:56.267
FRONT LINES OF THIS BATTLE.

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:57.802
AND AS WE'VE HEARD AND I'M HERE

00:38:57.868 --> 00:38:59.103
TO ALSO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.438
THE STATE HAS MADE A REMARKABLE

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.139
INVESTMENT IN LEGAL SERVICES

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:03.174
HOWEVER.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.242
ONLY 20% OF THE FUNDING THAT THE

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:06.944
STATE HAS PROVIDED HAS GONE TO

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:08.612
REMOVAL DEFENSE SERVICES.

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:10.281
AND THOSE DOLLARS HAVE HONESTLY

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:12.616
BEEN LIMITED TO URBAN AREAS

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:14.051
WHERE THERE ARE STILL

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:15.820
ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE EXPERTISE

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:18.122
TO ACTUALLY MAKE RESPONSIBLE USE

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.657
OF THESE FUNDS.

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:20.624
CRITICAL SUPPORT FOR THESE

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:21.892
SERVICES IS JUST SIMPLY NOT

00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:23.828
REACHING CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IN

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:24.662
REMOTE AND RURAL REGIONS OF OUR

00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:25.496
STATE.

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:26.530
AND THT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE

00:39:26.597 --> 00:39:27.998
CASE UNLESS WE MAKE AN

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:29.834
INVESTMENT TO GROW CAPACITY. TO

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.602

YOU KNOW -- BETTER THAN ME HOW

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.575
ABOUT THAT THE API COMMUNITY --

00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.210
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS ALSO HOME

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:40.277
TO A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:41.846
THIS COMMUNITY SO THIS IS A

00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:43.380
PROPOSAL FOR CAPACITY BUILDING

00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:45.616
ON THIS ON THE ISSUE THAT YOU

00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:45.816
WERE.

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:47.218
ASKING EARLIER -- SO THE

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:48.419
CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT JUSTICE

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:50.087
FELLOWSHIP IS A ONE TIME FOUR

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:51.756
POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR ASKED

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:53.057
TO SUPPORT A PILOT PROGRAM.

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:54.592
IT WOULD DO SEVERAL THINGS FIRST

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:55.626
PROVIDE THE FIRST STATE

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:57.094
SPONSORED LEGAL FELLOWSHIP

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:58.529

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:00.231
MOBILE DEFENSE SERVICES FOR

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:01.599
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SECOND.

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:02.767
IT WOULD INCREASE WORKFORCE

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.668
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAW STUDENTS

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:05.703
AND YOUNG ATTORNEYS THAT WANT

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.905
NOTHING MORE THAN TO RETURN HOME

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:08.939
TO THESE AREAS OF HIGH NEED BUT

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.407
REALLY HAVE NO VIABLE OPTIONS

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:11.509
FOR DOING SO.

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.077
AND FINALLY IT WILL EXPAND THE

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.245
NUMBER OF REPUTABLE LEGAL

00:40:14.311 --> 00:40:16.213
SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ELIGIBLE

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.214

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:18.582
SERVICES OUR STATE.

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:19.784
AND WHILE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:20.951
BEGIN AS A PILOT IN NORTHERN

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:22.319
CALIFORNIA AND THE SF

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:23.654
IMMIGRATION COURT.

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:24.755
IT'S NOTEWORTHY THAT THE

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:26.056
JURISDICTION OF THE COURT

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:27.792
EXTENDS AS FAR NORTH AS OREGON

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:28.859
BORDER AND AS FAR SOUTH AS

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:30.628
BAKERSFIELD.

00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:32.696
SO THIS PROPOSAL -- WHAT THE

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:33.798
EXPERTISE RICHARD IT'S OUT OF

00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:35.065

FOR THE NEXT YEAR THAT WOULD

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:11.858
HONEST FIFTY TWO COUNTIES AND WE

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:12.892
SHOULD HEAR FROM LAST YEAR WE

WILL HAVE THAT WAY FOR A PLACE

01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:20.300
OKAY THE WILD CARD OF COURSE IS

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:24.471
THE FEDS HAVE A PROPOSED RULE

01:52:24.537 --> 01:52:25.905
OUT THAT JUST CLOSED FOR COMMENT.

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:26.573
THAT WOULD REALLY RADICALLY

01:52:26.639 --> 01:52:27.540
CHANGE THE WHOLE WAIVER

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:28.741
FRAMEWORK SO WE WILL WAIT AND

01:52:28.808 --> 01:52:30.310
SEE WHAT THE FINAL RULE IS.

01:52:30.376 --> 01:52:32.879
BUT PENDING -- NO CHANGE IN THAT

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:33.680
AND PENDING AT THIS YEAR'S

01:52:33.746 --> 01:52:35.014
WAIVERS APPROVED LIKE LAST

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:36.282
YEAR'S WHAT WE WE WOULD BE

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:37.417
IMPLEMENTING THAT TIME LIMIT IN

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:39.319
THE SIX COUNTIES OKAY STARTING

01:52:39.385 --> 01:52:40.687
IN SEPTEMBER [inaudible]

01:52:40.753 --> 01:52:46.226
AND OKAY AND AND JUST SO WHAT'S

01:52:46.292 --> 01:52:47.093
A CASE OF THE DAY THAT VERY

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.661
BRIEFLY THAT THAT FEDERAL RULE

01:52:48.728 --> 01:52:51.431
CHANGE THAT THEY CLOSE THEM AND

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:52.732
WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT AND WHEN

01:52:52.799 --> 01:52:53.900
WOULD THAT TAKE AFFECTED THEY

01:52:53.967 --> 01:52:55.435
ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THAT AGAIN

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:56.002
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FINAL

01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.836
RULE IS SO.

01:52:56.903 --> 01:52:58.371
IT'S A LITTLE BIT SPECULATION

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.807
BUT RIGHT TAKING THE LAST

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:01.841
QUESTION WAS PROPOSED A NOTICE

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:03.643
OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING WAS IN

01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:05.378
JANUARY AND IF THAT THE PROPOSED

01:53:05.445 --> 01:53:07.480
RULE BECAME FINAL AS PROPOSED

01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:08.915
WOULD BE OCTOBER FIRST.

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:10.550
THAT SEEMS ON THAT SEEMS VERY

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:11.951
FAST.

01:53:12.018 --> 01:53:13.586
GIVEN THAT WILL MAKE IT THE THE

01:53:13.653 --> 01:53:14.420
COMMENT PERIOD JUST CLOSE THIS

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:15.555
WEEK BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN

01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:16.789
PARTLY BECAUSE OF AN EXTENSION

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:18.057
BUT NONE THE LESS IT COULD BE A

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:20.126
QUITE FAST OUR TIME LINE.

01:53:20.193 --> 01:53:22.028
AND IT REALLY CHANGES ALL THE

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:28.968
CRITERIA FOR WAIVER CHANGES THE

01:53:29.035 --> 01:53:30.370
ABUSE ONE APPOINTMENT DATA. TO

01:53:30.436 --> 01:53:31.304
TO JUSTIFY A WAIVER FROM THE

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:32.105
TIME LIMIT YOU KNOW SUCH A WAY

01:53:32.172 --> 01:53:32.939
THAT ALMOST ALL OF CALIFORNIA

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:33.873
WOULD IMMEDIATELY COME OFTEN

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.375
NEED TO IMPLEMENT TIME LIMITED

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:36.609
WORK REQUIREMENTS ESSENTIALLY

01:53:36.676 --> 01:53:38.811
ESSENTIALLY MOVED INTRSTATE OFF.

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:40.780
YES AND THE OTHER BIG CHALLENGE

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:43.683
FOR US IS WE HAVE A BANK OF OF

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:45.118
MONTHS OF FOOD FROM YEARS OF

DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO SORT OF

02:13:11.016 --> 02:13:12.584
AUTOMATED INFORMATION MAKES IT

02:13:12.651 --> 02:13:13.985
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SERVE THE

02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:15.487

02:37:40.584 --> 02:37:41.985
ECONOMIST AND OTHERS HAVE RAISES

CERTAINLY HOPE THAT HAPPENS --

02:38:31.435 --> 02:38:33.136
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T PEOPLE ARE

02:38:55.192 --> 02:38:57.227
BUILD IN THE CONCEPT OF HAVE

02:38:57.294 --> 02:38:59.496
KIND OF THAT CASE LOAD AT BANDS

02:38:59.563 --> 02:39:01.064

ME TO DETERMINE WHAT ADDITIONAL

02:40:15.939 --> 02:40:17.808
ADJUSTMENTS MIGHT BE NEEDED.

02:40:17.874 --> 02:40:18.709
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WE'RE

02:40:18.775 --> 02:40:20.143
HOPING TO COME TO AGREEMENT ON

02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:21.645

TO WORK TOWARDS THAT OKAY I LIKE

02:40:34.458 --> 02:40:36.326
THAT IDEA.

02:40:36.393 --> 02:40:37.394
OKAY AND IS IT IN THIS THAT THAT

02:40:37.461 --> 02:40:38.929
SORT OF BECAUSE WE KNOW WE TOOK

02:40:38.996 --> 02:40:41.164
A ONE PIECE EARLIER SO THAT.

02:40:41.231 --> 02:40:44.267
THAT KIND OF ADDRESS THE ZERO I

02:40:44.334 --> 02:40:46.536
THINK THAT THAT SINGLE

02:40:46.603 --> 02:40:48.705
ALLOCATION ARE ARE.

02:40:48.772 --> 02:40:50.207

02:41:02.953 --> 02:41:04.988

02:45:17.707 --> 02:45:19.643
SOLUTIONS AS THE VENDOR TO YOU

02:45:19.709 --> 02:45:21.411
AT PROVIDE A ROAD MAP I IN A

02:45:21.478 --> 02:45:23.013
PLAN AND THEY UNDERTOOK A NUMBER

02:45:23.079 --> 02:45:25.148
OF FOCUS GROUPS -- INTERVIEWS

02:45:25.215 --> 02:45:26.549
AND SITE VISITS ACROSS THE STATE

02:45:26.616 --> 02:45:28.018
HAD TO REALLY TRYTO IDENTIFY

02:45:28.084 --> 02:45:29.586
WHAT TYPES OF SOLUTIONS WOULD

02:45:29.653 --> 02:45:31.254
SUPPORT VERIFICATION THE

02:45:31.321 --> 02:45:33.189
APPLICATION HUB WAS ONE AND

02:45:33.256 --> 02:45:33.790
SEVERAL DIFFERENT

02:45:33.857 --> 02:45:35.625
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MANY RELATED

02:45:35.692 --> 02:45:37.927
TO POLICY ALIGNMENT -- WAYS TO

02:45:37.994 --> 02:45:41.064
REDUCE THAT PAPERWORK -- AND ADD

02:45:41.131 --> 02:45:42.032
A STREAMLINED.

02:45:42.098 --> 02:45:42.932
PROCESSES SUCH AS SCANNING

02:45:42.999 --> 02:45:44.100
INFORMATION AND COUNTY SOCIAL

02:45:44.167 --> 02:45:45.302
SERVICE AGENCIES LOBBIES THOSE

02:45:45.368 --> 02:45:47.270
KINDS OF THINGS SO -- WE ARE

02:45:47.337 --> 02:45:48.705
JUST AT THE POINT WHERE WE ARE

02:45:48.772 --> 02:45:49.839
IDENTIFYING OF THOSE

02:45:49.906 --> 02:45:50.840
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE

02:45:50.907 --> 02:45:52.909
BROUGHT FORTH IN THAT REPORT

02:45:52.976 --> 02:45:54.644
INCLUDING THE HAVE HOW WE WILL.

02:45:54.711 --> 02:45:56.179
MOVE FORWARD TO PURSUE THOSE AND

02:45:56.246 --> 02:45:57.080
AS WE ARE IDENTIFYING THOSE WILL

02:45:57.147 --> 02:46:01.718
AGAIN ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS TO

02:46:01.785 --> 02:46:05.121
HELP US ALONG THE WAY.

02:46:05.188 --> 02:46:07.090
AND THEN -- THAT CHANGES THE

02:46:07.157 --> 02:46:08.925
CITY A RESERVE.

02:46:08.992 --> 02:46:09.859
THAT FINANCE SURE SO I CAN KIND

02:46:09.926 --> 02:46:10.493
OF EXPLAIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:12.028
THINKING ON THIS PROPOSAL ON

02:46:12.095 --> 02:46:13.963
THAT WAS GENERALLY THAT.

02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:15.565
WE CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:46:15.632 --> 02:46:18.568
WE WANTED TO APPROACH A RESERVE

02:46:18.635 --> 02:46:21.638
MORE NIMBLY AND CAME UP WITH THE

02:46:21.705 --> 02:46:22.806
IDEA THAT I WE DESCRIBED A

02:46:22.872 --> 02:46:24.274
METHODOLOGY AROUND PUTTING

02:46:24.341 --> 02:46:25.542
FUNDING.

02:46:25.608 --> 02:46:26.710
INTO THE RESERVE AND PULLING

02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:29.479
FINDING OUT DURING A RECESSION.

02:46:29.546 --> 02:46:32.482
IT MIGHT OVERLOOK HOW UNIQUE

02:46:32.549 --> 02:46:34.284
SUMMER SESSIONS ARE COMPARED TO

02:46:34.351 --> 02:46:35.285
OTHERS.

02:46:35.352 --> 02:46:36.619
AND WHAT THE MEDI CAL AND CAL

02:46:36.686 --> 02:46:38.088
WORKS PROGRAM LOOK LIKE IN TERMS

02:46:38.154 --> 02:46:40.123
OF SERVICE TYPES AT THAT POINT

02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:41.091
IN TIME.

02:46:41.157 --> 02:46:42.425
A CASELOAD LEVELS AND

02:46:42.492 --> 02:46:44.761
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THIS CASE LOADS.

02:46:44.828 --> 02:46:47.364
SO WE THOUGHT THAT BY REMOVING

02:46:47.430 --> 02:46:49.366
THAT METHODOLOGY THAT WOULD FREE

02:46:49.432 --> 02:46:50.567
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:46:50.633 --> 02:46:53.336
LEGISLATURE. TO HAVE A MORE

02:46:53.403 --> 02:46:56.072
FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING.

02:46:56.139 --> 02:46:57.173
WHAT FUNDING NEEDS TO GO INTO

02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:58.475
THE PROGRAM WHEN IT DOWNTURN

02:46:58.541 --> 02:47:00.410
OCCURS?

02:47:00.477 --> 02:47:02.112
AND THE FULL INTENT IS TO STILL

02:47:02.178 --> 02:47:04.114
KEEP THAT FUNDING SPECIFICALLY

02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:05.382
FOR THE COWARDS AND MEDICAL

02:47:05.448 --> 02:47:06.182
PROGRAMS [inaudible]

02:47:06.249 --> 02:47:08.918
OKAY.

02:47:08.985 --> 02:47:11.020
OKAY -- SO ANY COMMENTS FROM LA

02:47:11.087 --> 02:47:13.289
ABOUT ANY OF THESE OTHER -- ALL

02:47:13.356 --> 02:47:14.424
THE ITEMS THAT.

02:47:14.491 --> 02:47:17.060
SURE I'LL SPEAK -- SPECIFICALLY

02:47:17.127 --> 02:47:18.261
TO THE THE RESERVE A CENTRAL

02:47:18.328 --> 02:47:19.396
CHANGES THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:47:19.462 --> 02:47:20.764
PROPOSED.

02:47:20.830 --> 02:47:22.799
AS PART OF UP AS PART OF THIS

02:47:22.866 --> 02:47:25.769
BUDGET ON THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS

02:47:25.835 --> 02:47:27.170
JUST THE SORT OF STEP BACK ONE

02:47:27.237 --> 02:47:28.972
STEP IS THAT.

02:47:29.038 --> 02:47:30.707
THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET

02:47:30.774 --> 02:47:33.676
ACTS -- AND RELATED LEGISLATION.

02:47:33.743 --> 02:47:36.279
INCLUDED SUB ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE

02:47:36.346 --> 02:47:38.081
SAFETY NET RESERVE ONE EACH FOR

02:47:38.148 --> 02:47:41.084
CAL WORKSAND MEDI CAL AND SO.

02:47:41.151 --> 02:47:42.852
THERE WAS SORT OF FOR A FIRE

02:47:42.919 --> 02:47:43.052
WALL.

02:47:43.119 --> 02:47:44.454
STATUTORY.

02:47:44.521 --> 02:47:45.989
BUT NONETHELESS A FIREWALL

02:47:46.055 --> 02:47:46.990
BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMMERS ARE

02:47:47.056 --> 02:47:48.391
ACCOUNTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S

02:47:48.458 --> 02:47:49.626
PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE THAT AND

02:47:49.692 --> 02:47:51.261
TREAT THEM AS SORT OF IN A

02:47:51.327 --> 02:47:54.898
SINGLE BUCKET TOGETHER -- WE

02:47:54.964 --> 02:47:56.533
THINK THAT THAT MIGHT.

02:47:56.599 --> 02:47:57.000
ALLOW THE LEGISLATION

02:47:57.066 --> 02:47:58.201
ADMINISTRATION SOME ADDITIONAL

02:47:58.268 --> 02:48:00.236
FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE -- BUT

02:48:00.303 --> 02:48:01.704
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THE EXISTING

02:48:01.771 --> 02:48:03.773
STATUTORY.

02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:05.742
SUB ACCOUNTS STRUCTURE.

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:07.010
SORT OF ELIMINATED THE

02:48:07.076 --> 02:48:09.145
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE

02:48:09.212 --> 02:48:10.613
TO SHIFT FUNDS BACK AND FORTH.

02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:11.815
DEPENDING ON ITS NEEDS BECAUSE

02:48:11.881 --> 02:48:13.650
IT COULD CHANGE LAW UPPER

02:48:13.716 --> 02:48:14.784
STATUTE.

02:48:14.851 --> 02:48:16.052
AND THEN SECONDLY.

02:48:16.119 --> 02:48:18.788
THE FORMULA DRIVEN APPROACH THAT

02:48:18.855 --> 02:48:20.890
WAS -- SWIFT.

02:48:20.957 --> 02:48:23.827
RECOMMENDED OR OR THAT WAS --

02:48:23.893 --> 02:48:26.162
INCLUDED IN THAT THE EIGHTEEN

02:48:26.229 --> 02:48:27.964
NINETEEN BUDGET ACT RELATED

02:48:28.031 --> 02:48:30.066
LEGISLATION -- DEPARTING FROM

02:48:30.133 --> 02:48:32.802
THAT MY ALSO ALLOW THE

02:48:32.869 --> 02:48:34.771
LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SORT OF AS

02:48:34.838 --> 02:48:36.139
THE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:48:36.206 --> 02:48:37.807
MENTIONED -- SPECIFIC

02:48:37.874 --> 02:48:39.375
DETERMINATIONS DEPENDING ON

02:48:39.442 --> 02:48:41.144
WHERE YOU ARE IN THAT THE

02:48:41.211 --> 02:48:42.612
BUSINESS CYCLE OR OR THE COW

02:48:42.679 --> 02:48:45.148
WORKS CASELOAD THAT MIND ALLOW --

02:48:45.215 --> 02:48:46.449
SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY SO

02:48:46.516 --> 02:48:47.050
WE CAN MAKE SPECIFIC

02:48:47.116 --> 02:48:48.451
RECOMMENDATIONS ON EITHER OF

02:48:48.518 --> 02:48:49.552
THOSE TWO PROPOSALS.

02:48:49.619 --> 02:48:51.087
REGARDING THE FORMULA DIFFERENT

02:48:51.154 --> 02:48:52.889
APPROACH WE WE DID POINT OUT

02:48:52.956 --> 02:48:54.757
THAT ONE ALTERNATIVE MIGHT BE

02:48:54.824 --> 02:48:56.392
SORT OF A COMPROMISE -- TO

02:48:56.459 --> 02:48:58.294
INCLUDE AS PART OF THE THE

02:48:58.361 --> 02:48:59.696
BUDGET CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE

02:48:59.762 --> 02:49:01.297
ADMINISTRATION IN THE

02:49:01.364 --> 02:49:02.232
LEGISLATURE EACH YEAR.

02:49:02.298 --> 02:49:04.868
AN INDICATION OF WHAT THE CASE

02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:06.503
LOAD SAVINGS ARE IN A IN DOLLAR

02:49:06.569 --> 02:49:08.671
TERMS IN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM

02:49:08.738 --> 02:49:10.640
FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT AS THE

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:11.608
CASE LOADS DECLINING AS IT IS

02:49:11.674 --> 02:49:12.175
NOW.

02:49:12.242 --> 02:49:13.543
AND SORT OF HIGHLIGHTING ARE

02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:15.512
ELEVATING THAT NUMBER AS PART OF

02:49:15.578 --> 02:49:17.447
THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS ALLOWING

02:49:17.514 --> 02:49:21.050
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:49:21.117 --> 02:49:22.085
LEGISLATURE.

02:49:22.151 --> 02:49:23.786
TO SEE THAT NUMBER NEGOTIATE

02:49:23.853 --> 02:49:24.654
SAID A PORTION OF IT BE

02:49:24.721 --> 02:49:25.922
DEPOSITED IN THE RESERVE AND

02:49:25.989 --> 02:49:26.956
DIFFERENT PORTION BE USE FOR FOR

02:49:27.023 --> 02:49:28.958
OTHER PROGRAM PRIORITIES --

02:49:29.025 --> 02:49:30.093
WITHOUT THIS IS SORT OF A WAY TO

02:49:30.159 --> 02:49:32.095
KEEP THAT FRONT AND CENTER IN

02:49:32.161 --> 02:49:34.397
THE CONVERSATION.

02:49:34.464 --> 02:49:36.766
SO WHAT I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE

02:49:36.833 --> 02:49:40.003
SAFETY NET RESERVE -- AGAIN NICE

02:49:40.069 --> 02:49:41.604
THAT THOUGH I WOULD THE

02:49:41.671 --> 02:49:42.472
ULTIMATELY THE FOR TO OUR

02:49:42.539 --> 02:49:45.708
BUDGETARY WHO CONCEIVED OF THE

02:49:45.775 --> 02:49:47.877
RESERVE BUT I WOULD -- SAY AT

02:49:47.944 --> 02:49:50.647
LEAST IN MY MIND -- AND NOW WE

02:49:50.713 --> 02:49:51.881
TALK ABOUT THE LANGUAGE SO FORTH

02:49:51.948 --> 02:49:52.916
SO.

02:49:52.982 --> 02:49:53.850
RIGHT.

02:49:53.917 --> 02:49:54.584
IT'S SO IT'S A CERTAIN EXTENT OF

02:49:54.651 --> 02:49:56.319
FLEXIBILITY IS GOOD I MEAN AFTER

02:49:56.386 --> 02:49:58.021
ALL -- NOW WE MAKE DECISIONS AND

02:49:58.087 --> 02:49:59.489
HAVING MORE FLEXIBILITY -- AND

02:49:59.556 --> 02:50:01.090
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T

02:50:01.157 --> 02:50:02.025
HAVE FLEXIBILITY BUT I. SO WOULD

02:50:02.091 --> 02:50:04.160
BE SURE WE PROTECT THE INTENT OF

02:50:04.227 --> 02:50:05.929
THE SIX THAT RESERVE AT LEAST IN

02:50:05.995 --> 02:50:08.765
MY MIND THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:50:08.831 --> 02:50:09.098
FIRST OF ALL.

02:50:09.165 --> 02:50:10.500
THAT WERE.

02:50:10.567 --> 02:50:12.235
AND THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE

02:50:12.302 --> 02:50:13.770
RESERVE IS IS THAT DURING

02:50:13.836 --> 02:50:15.171
ESPECIALLY DURING A DOWNTURN

02:50:15.238 --> 02:50:17.440
THAT WE MAINTAIN AT LEAST UNTIL

02:50:17.507 --> 02:50:20.343
THE RESERVE IS EXHAUSTD THE THE

02:50:20.410 --> 02:50:22.312
THE SAME LEVEL OF BENEFITS AND

02:50:22.378 --> 02:50:23.846
THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND

02:50:23.913 --> 02:50:25.248
MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR

02:50:25.315 --> 02:50:26.916
BENEFICIARIES RIGHT FOR THE

02:50:26.983 --> 02:50:28.585
PEOPLE RECEIVING THAT THEY

02:50:28.651 --> 02:50:28.985
SHOULD.

02:50:29.052 --> 02:50:30.420
THAT EXISTS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO

02:50:30.486 --> 02:50:32.755
COUNTER CYCLICAL.

02:50:32.822 --> 02:50:34.624
YOU'RE LIKELY GET CUTS RIGHTS --

02:50:34.691 --> 02:50:36.125
BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WE SHOULD

02:50:36.192 --> 02:50:37.360
DO THAT THAT'S PART THE PURPOSE

02:50:37.427 --> 02:50:38.461
RESERVE THE EVEN THAT OUT.

02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:42.231
I WOULD ALSO PRICE SAY THAT --

02:50:42.298 --> 02:50:44.200
IN ALSO TO VOICE A PLANTATON TO

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:45.268
SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT I MEAN

02:50:45.335 --> 02:50:47.837
I COULD SEE EVEN GOOD TIMES ON

02:50:47.904 --> 02:50:49.272
SAYING -- YOU KNOW LOOK WE ARE

02:50:49.339 --> 02:50:50.073
MEETING -- TO TAKE OUT THE

02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:50.673
RESERVE AND WE CAN.

02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:51.874
MOVE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE SO

02:50:51.941 --> 02:50:52.909
THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT THE

02:50:52.976 --> 02:50:54.577
PURPOSE OF THE THE THE THE

02:50:54.644 --> 02:50:57.780
RESERVE AS WELL IS TO BASICALLY.

02:50:57.847 --> 02:50:59.315
ALLOW IT'S NOW I REALIZE THAT

02:50:59.382 --> 02:51:00.683
ANY FUTURE LEGISLATURE OR

02:51:00.750 --> 02:51:02.218
GOVERNOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE

02:51:02.285 --> 02:51:04.020
CONSTITUTION CAN EVENTUALLY DO I

02:51:04.087 --> 02:51:07.790
REALLY WANT THE TRAILER BILL

02:51:07.857 --> 02:51:10.226
LANGUAGE AT ALL CHANGES BUT BUT

02:51:10.293 --> 02:51:11.728
I I THINK THAT AT LEAST IN MY

02:51:11.794 --> 02:51:13.396
MIND CONCEPTUALLY -- DOWN THAT

02:51:13.463 --> 02:51:14.530
THE TOURNEY LOOK AT EXACTLY

02:51:14.597 --> 02:51:15.431
LANGUAGE I THINK THAT'S PLACE TO

02:51:15.498 --> 02:51:16.899
ME THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE IS THAT.

02:51:16.966 --> 02:51:17.600
YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT PRIOR

02:51:17.667 --> 02:51:19.636
YEAR AND YOU SAY WELL YOU KNOW

02:51:19.702 --> 02:51:22.005
WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING -- AND

02:51:22.071 --> 02:51:23.606
THAT EVEN IF WE PUT THE SAME

02:51:23.673 --> 02:51:26.175
LEVEL RESOURCE FOR SUSTAINING

02:51:26.242 --> 02:51:26.709
WERE NOT SO SO WE'RE NOT

02:51:26.776 --> 02:51:27.677
SUPPLANTING IN OUR PREVIOUS

02:51:27.744 --> 02:51:28.845
YEARS EFFORT.

02:51:28.911 --> 02:51:29.746
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STILL

02:51:29.812 --> 02:51:32.181
MAKE CUTS TO BENEFITS FOR THOSE

02:51:32.248 --> 02:51:33.583
PEOPLE WE GO THAT'S WHEN WE

02:51:33.650 --> 02:51:34.917
START DRYING DOWN FROM THAT

02:51:34.984 --> 02:51:36.352
<u>AFETY NET RESERVE.</u>

02:51:36.419 --> 02:51:38.788
NOT BEFORE AND BUT THAT'S A

02:51:38.855 --> 02:51:39.355
PURPOSE AND ONLY FOR THAT

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:41.457
PURPOSE SO AND CERTAINLY HAS

02:51:41.524 --> 02:51:45.194
MANY OTHER WORTHY ITEMS AND

02:51:45.261 --> 02:51:46.796
BUDGETS BUT IS.

02:51:46.863 --> 02:51:47.797
I MEAN THAT'S HOW I SEE IT.

02:51:47.864 --> 02:51:51.134
ANY THOUGHTS FROM FINANCE.

02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:53.636
SURE AND AND I THINK THAT THAT

02:51:53.703 --> 02:51:55.571
THE A LOT OF THE ORIGINAL INTENT

02:51:55.638 --> 02:51:57.073
YOU SPOKE OF HIS STILL.

02:51:57.140 --> 02:51:58.374
PRESERVED IN THAT LANGUAGE THAT

02:51:58.441 --> 02:51:59.742
THE FINDINGS DEDICATED FOR THOSE

02:51:59.809 --> 02:52:03.446
PURPOSES FOR THOSE PROGRAMS --

02:52:03.513 --> 02:52:05.682
HI BUT NOT NOTED ON HOW THE

02:52:05.748 --> 02:52:08.885
COUNTER CYCLICAL -- NATURE OF

02:52:08.951 --> 02:52:11.287
RECESSIONS NEEDS TO BE FACTORED

02:52:11.354 --> 02:52:13.890
IN TO HOW WE APPROACH USING

02:52:13.956 --> 02:52:15.391
THOSE RESERVE FUNDS.

02:52:15.458 --> 02:52:16.859
AND I I THINK OUR PROPOSAL

02:52:16.926 --> 02:52:18.528
ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT THAT AT

02:52:18.594 --> 02:52:19.829
THAT POINT IN TIME AND MAKE

02:52:19.896 --> 02:52:21.864
THOSE DETERMINATIONS ALONG WITH

02:52:21.931 --> 02:52:23.499
THE LEGISLATURE SO I THINK

02:52:23.566 --> 02:52:24.734
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN ANY WHATEVER

02:52:24.801 --> 02:52:26.869
LANGUAGE WE PUT IN RECOGNIZING

02:52:26.936 --> 02:52:27.470
BE CHANGED BY ANY FUTURE LET'S

02:52:27.537 --> 02:52:29.305
SURGERY GOVERNOR IS TO CLEAR TO

02:52:29.372 --> 02:52:33.843
CLEARLY.

02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:37.413
STATE WHAT OUR DESIRE -- YOU

02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:38.214
KNOW I THINK IT NEEDS A

02:52:38.281 --> 02:52:39.148
DIFFERENT KIND OF CONVERSATION

02:52:39.215 --> 02:52:39.716
WHEN ONE HAS TO CHANGE THAT

02:52:39.782 --> 02:52:39.982
LANGUAGE.

02:52:40.049 --> 02:52:42.018
IF YOU PUT IN THAT LANGUAGE THAT

02:52:42.085 --> 02:52:45.254
AND TO AND SIMPLY SAY WELL SOME

02:52:45.321 --> 02:52:47.457
LEGISLATURE SOME THAT AND THEN

02:52:47.523 --> 02:52:48.891
WE JUST GOT LEFT A BLANK THERE

02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:49.559
SO I'M HOPING THAT IN OUR

02:52:49.625 --> 02:52:50.993
CONVERSATIONS WE WILL HAVE SOME

02:52:51.060 --> 02:52:52.361
LANGUAGE TO VERY CLEARLY

02:52:52.428 --> 02:52:54.330
DESCRIBE WHAT IS THE INTENT OF

02:52:54.397 --> 02:52:55.732
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR.

02:52:55.798 --> 02:52:58.000
NOW FOR THIS RESERVE SO THAT --

02:52:58.067 --> 02:52:59.502
THE RESERVES USED IMPROPERLY AND

02:52:59.569 --> 02:53:02.004
CERTAINLY AGAIN ANY FUTURE

02:53:02.071 --> 02:53:04.207
LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR CAN.

02:53:04.273 --> 02:53:05.742

02:53:08.544 --> 02:53:09.612

02:53:09.679 --> 02:53:11.447
WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT STAGE ONE

02:53:11.514 --> 02:53:13.883
AND THEY NEED TO GO SHORTLY SO I

02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:15.718

I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF

03:01:33.482 --> 03:01:36.051
COMMENTS ABOUT THE OVERVIEW --

03:01:36.118 --> 03:01:39.221
AND REALLY -- FLEET TIED

03:01:39.288 --> 03:01:40.122
TOGETHER -- WHAT YOU HEARD

03:01:40.189 --> 03:01:41.590
AROUND THE DISCUSSION AROUND CAL

03:01:41.657 --> 03:01:43.692
OR AND AND THE SINGLE ALLOCATION

03:01:43.759 --> 03:01:45.327
BECAUSE WE SEE THEM AS? TWO

03:01:45.394 --> 03:01:47.162
PIECES OF THE SAME MOMENT IN THE

03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:49.498
SAME DIRECTION THAT THE STATE IS

03:01:49.565 --> 03:01:51.400
HEADED -- AND WE CAN COVER WITH

03:01:51.467 --> 03:01:53.102
THE STATE AND WE ARE WELL I

03:01:53.168 --> 03:01:54.270

TIME WORKING ON THIS WE ARE VERY --

03:01:59.375 --> 03:02:00.743
ENCOURAGED BY THE PATH THAT

03:02:00.809 --> 03:02:02.444
WE'RE GOING DOWN AND WE THINK

03:02:02.511 --> 03:02:04.146
THAT WILL MAKE A REALLY

03:02:04.213 --> 03:02:05.547
SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE WE THINK.

03:02:05.614 --> 03:02:10.953
ARMED AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER --

03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:11.787
I WOULD REALLY URGE THE

03:02:11.854 --> 03:02:12.655
LEGISLATURE TO PUT A VERY SHARP

03:02:12.721 --> 03:02:14.923
BY GOING FOR IT MAY REVISE AND

03:02:14.990 --> 03:02:15.624
BEYOND.

03:02:15.691 --> 03:02:17.626
ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE

03:02:17.693 --> 03:02:18.961
SINGLE ALLOCATION FORMULA.

03:02:19.028 --> 03:02:20.496
BECAUSE TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH

03:02:20.562 --> 03:02:22.731
WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE

03:02:22.798 --> 03:02:24.933
HOPE TO AND CAL WAR WE NEED TO

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:26.001
BE GIVING COUNTIES THE

03:02:26.068 --> 03:02:28.203
APPROPRIATE FISCAL INCENTIVES.

03:02:28.270 --> 03:02:29.938
TO PUSH THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF

03:02:30.005 --> 03:02:31.106
DOING THE THINGS THAT WE THINK

03:02:31.173 --> 03:02:33.075
ARE IMPORTANT FOR FAMILIES TO BE

03:02:33.142 --> 03:02:34.943
SUCCESSFUL -- AND SO IN

03:02:35.010 --> 03:02:36.578
PARTICULAR I THINK YOU KNOW WE

03:02:36.645 --> 03:02:38.614
WOULD LIKE MORE WE WOULD LIKE TO

03:02:38.681 --> 03:02:39.815
SEE AN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR FAMILY

03:02:39.882 --> 03:02:41.617
SO SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO WORK

03:02:41.684 --> 03:02:43.085
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE INCENTIVES.

03:02:43.152 --> 03:02:44.386
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET

03:02:44.453 --> 03:02:47.056
EDUCATION HALF THE RECIPIENTS OF

03:02:47.122 --> 03:02:48.691
THE PROGRAM COME INTO IT WOULD

03:02:48.757 --> 03:02:50.092
OUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA SO

03:02:50.159 --> 03:02:51.260
THESE ARE REALLY CRITICAL

03:02:51.327 --> 03:02:52.428
DEVELOPMENTS I THINK IS.

03:02:52.494 --> 03:02:54.096
AS YOU MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE

03:02:54.163 --> 03:02:55.431
THAT WE'RE DOING THAT AND TYING

03:02:55.497 --> 03:02:57.132
BACK INTO WHAT YOU JUST HEARD ON

03:02:57.199 --> 03:02:58.467
THE TWELVE MONTH AUTHORIZATION

03:02:58.534 --> 03:02:59.835
FOR CHILD CARE.

03:02:59.902 --> 03:03:01.136
IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT

03:03:01.203 --> 03:03:02.237
WE'RE PROVIDING APPROPRIATE

03:03:02.304 --> 03:03:04.473
FISCAL INCENTIVES WE ALSO WANT

03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:06.842
TO MAKE SURE THAT SERVICES ARE

03:03:06.909 --> 03:03:08.477
ACTUALLY BEING PROVIDED THAT

03:03:08.544 --> 03:03:10.846
PEOPLE NEED AT THE TIME THAT

03:03:10.913 --> 03:03:11.246
THEY NEED THEM.

03:03:11.313 --> 03:03:13.182
SO THAT ONCE WE TELL FAMILY

03:03:13.248 --> 03:03:14.450
THEY'RE GOING TO IT THEY'RE

03:03:14.516 --> 03:03:15.651
GOING TO BE GOING TO EDUCATION

03:03:15.718 --> 03:03:17.186
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO

03:03:17.252 --> 03:03:18.554
REPEATEDLY GO BACK AND PURSUE

03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:19.888
AND TRY TO GET APPROVAL FOR

03:03:19.955 --> 03:03:21.957

TO STUDENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF

03:03:27.863 --> 03:03:30.599
SEMESTERS SO IT'S MORE THAN JUST.

03:03:30.666 --> 03:03:31.967
FIXING THE SINGLE ALLOCATION

03:03:32.034 --> 03:03:33.435
IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE THAT

03:03:33.502 --> 03:03:35.504
SERVICES ARE PROVIDED NGUYEN

03:03:35.571 --> 03:03:37.940
FAMILIES NEED THEM AND REDUCING

03:03:38.006 --> 03:03:38.674
THE AMOUNT OF BACK AND FORTH

03:03:38.741 --> 03:03:40.209
IT'S GOOD CURRENTLY OCCURRING IN

03:03:40.275 --> 03:03:41.443
THE PROGRAM.

03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:42.778
SO WE JUST WANTED TO KIND OF

03:03:42.845 --> 03:03:44.146
BOLD TIE THOSE TWO ISSUES

03:03:44.213 --> 03:03:46.515
TOGETHER AND THEN LASTLY ON THE

CUTS -- BEFORE AND THAT WOULD

03:03:59.795 --> 03:04:01.196
HAVE MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IF WE

03:04:01.263 --> 03:04:03.065
HAD THAT RESERVE AT THAT TIME WE

03:04:03.132 --> 03:04:04.133

03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:16.745
BETTER JOB OF INSULATING CALLERS

03:04:16.812 --> 03:04:17.780

STAGE ONE CHILD CARE.

03:08:39.041 --> 03:08:40.142
OFTEN THEY ARE NOT AWARE THAT

03:08:40.208 --> 03:08:42.377
PAID CHILDCARE IS AVAILABLE IF

PROCESSES BURDENSOME AND FULL OF

03:08:45.981 --> 03:08:47.382
A LOT OF RED TAPE AND OR

03:08:47.449 --> 03:08:48.784
MULTIPLE STEPS TO GET AN

03:08:48.850 --> 03:08:50.052
AUTHORIZATION.

03:08:50.118 --> 03:08:51.653
THEY ARE OFTEN SHORT TERM AND

03:08:51.720 --> 03:08:53.655
FREQUENTLY DISRUPTED ONE DAY

03:08:53.722 --> 03:08:54.690
THREE DAYS.

03:08:54.756 --> 03:08:56.425
AND FAMILIES WHO DO SUCCEED AND

03:08:56.491 --> 03:08:58.460
GETTING AND KEEPING STAGE ONE

03:08:58.527 --> 03:09:00.429
CAN EXPERIENCE A DISRUPTION AT

03:09:00.495 --> 03:09:02.164
THE TIME THAT THEY TRANSFERRED

03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:04.466
TO THE NEXT STAGE OF CHILD CARE

03:09:04.533 --> 03:09:05.267
STAGE.

03:09:05.333 --> 03:09:06.468
TO WE FIND THAT THERE ARE

03:09:06.535 --> 03:09:08.336
PARENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CAL

03:09:08.403 --> 03:09:09.604
WORKS CHILD CARE WHO ARE

03:09:09.671 --> 03:09:11.139
APPEARING ON COUNTY WAITING

03:09:11.206 --> 03:09:12.908
LISTS FOR CHILDCARE BECAUSE

03:09:12.974 --> 03:09:14.342
THEY'VE NEVER BEEN PROPERLY

03:09:14.409 --> 03:09:16.311
CONNECTED TO THE RESOURCES THEY

03:09:16.378 --> 03:09:17.579
QUALIFY.

03:09:17.646 --> 03:09:20.515
FOR SO VERY SIMPLY THIS BUDGET.

03:09:20.582 --> 03:09:22.718
REQUEST WOULD ESTABLISH TWELVE

03:09:22.784 --> 03:09:24.720
MONTH ELIGIBILITY IN STAGE ONE

03:09:24.786 --> 03:09:26.588
WHICH IS ALREADY PROVIDED IN

03:09:26.655 --> 03:09:29.224
EVERY CHILD CARE SUBSIDY PROGRAM

03:09:29.291 --> 03:09:32.494
IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT FOR STAGE.

03:09:32.561 --> 03:09:34.930
ONE AND I WON'T GO INTO THE

03:09:34.996 --> 03:09:36.364
BENEFITS OF THAT BUT I THINK

03:09:36.431 --> 03:09:36.998
WHAT.

03:09:37.065 --> 03:09:38.834
MS JOHNSON JUST DESCRIBED OF

03:09:38.900 --> 03:09:40.635
MAKING SURE THERE ARE GOOD

03:09:40.702 --> 03:09:43.071
CONSISTENT QUALITY CHILD CARE

03:09:43.138 --> 03:09:45.574
OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO PARENTS AND

03:09:45.640 --> 03:09:47.142
THE BENEFITS TO CHILDREN OF

03:09:47.209 --> 03:09:49.211
HAVING THAT DURING THIS TIME OF

03:09:49.277 --> 03:09:50.579
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT.

03:09:50.645 --> 03:09:52.581
IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW PARENTS TO

03:09:52.647 --> 03:09:54.883
GET CHILD CARE TO PARTICIPATE IN

03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:57.385
NEEDED ACTIVITIES AND AGAIN --

03:09:57.452 --> 03:10:00.188
MOVING SLIGHTLY FROM THE WELFARE

03:10:00.255 --> 03:10:02.057
TO WORK CONCEPT TO WHAT IS IT

03:10:02.124 --> 03:10:03.992
THAT A FAMILY NEEDS TO STABILIZE

03:10:04.059 --> 03:10:05.794
AND IMPROVE ITS PROSPECTS YOU

03:10:05.861 --> 03:10:06.528
HEARD ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO

03:10:06.595 --> 03:10:07.829
COULDN'T GO TO A DOMESTIC

03:10:07.896 --> 03:10:09.297
VIOLENCE COUNSELLING OR TRAUMA

03:10:09.364 --> 03:10:10.165
COUNSELING.

03:10:10.232 --> 03:10:11.867
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T BRING

03:10:11.933 --> 03:10:12.901
THEIR CHILD WITH THEM.

03:10:12.968 --> 03:10:14.336
AND GIVE THE PARENT THE OPTIONAL

03:10:14.402 --> 03:10:15.871
FULL TIME CARE SO THAT THEIR

03:10:15.937 --> 03:10:17.739
CHILDREN GET BETTER ACCESS TO

03:10:17.806 --> 03:10:19.241
THE RANGE OF LICENSED EARLY

03:10:19.307 --> 03:10:20.275
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

03:10:20.342 --> 03:10:22.577
OPPORTUNITIES.

03:10:22.644 --> 03:10:24.012
ENSURE SMOOTH TRANSFERS.

03:10:24.079 --> 03:10:25.213
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:27.048
SAN FRANCISCO PILOT BUT IT HAS

03:10:27.115 --> 03:10:29.518
HAD -- AND A VERY BIG EFFECT ON

03:10:29.584 --> 03:10:31.052
THE STAGE ONE FAMILIES THAT HAVE

03:10:31.119 --> 03:10:33.221

03:17:35.677 --> 03:17:38.880
OF THE OVERALL ACCESS AT THAT

03:17:38.947 --> 03:17:40.481
THE AUTHORIZATION IS WHAT THAT

03:17:40.548 --> 03:17:41.649
THE PARENT KNOWS THEY KNOW THEY

03:17:41.716 --> 03:17:43.184
ARE AUTHORIZED FOR CARE AT THAT

03:17:43.251 --> 03:17:44.619
SPECIFICITY OF THEIR ACTIVITIES

03:17:44.686 --> 03:17:46.588
AND THAT'S HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO

03:17:46.654 --> 03:17:47.889
COMMUNICATE WHAT THEN -- THEY'RE

03:17:47.956 --> 03:17:49.090
LOOKING FOR WITH THE PROVIDER SO

03:17:49.157 --> 03:17:51.459
I THINK YOU COULD HEAR THAT SOME

03:17:51.526 --> 03:17:52.093
POVIDERS YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S

03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:53.928
A LOT OF VARIATION IN TERMS OF

03:17:53.995 --> 03:17:56.364
WHAT PROVIDERS -- I PROVIDE SOME

03:17:56.431 --> 03:17:57.398

SUMMER MORE FLEXIBLE PART TIME

03:17:58.967 --> 03:18:00.034
BUT THAT REALLY DOES VERY IN A

03:18:00.101 --> 03:18:05.607
VERY IS FOR THE AGE RANGE OF THE

03:18:05.673 --> 03:18:07.675
CHILD AS WELL.

03:18:07.742 --> 03:18:09.711
A AND A I'M ACTUALLY CURIOUS

03:18:09.777 --> 03:18:11.779
FROM THE THE I MEAN.

03:18:11.846 --> 03:18:13.715
WE HAVE PEOPLE TRY RUN CHILD

03:18:13.781 --> 03:18:15.283
CARE IS OUR REPRESENTS YOUR IS

03:18:15.350 --> 03:18:16.384
THAT GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE

03:18:16.451 --> 03:18:17.051
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW SO YOU KIND

03:18:17.118 --> 03:18:19.187
OF HAVE TO CHARGE MORE TO EVEN

03:18:19.254 --> 03:18:20.588
OUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE.

03:18:20.655 --> 03:18:21.689
AT THE PERSONS LIKE.

03:18:21.756 --> 03:18:23.758
IT NEEDS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE

03:18:23.825 --> 03:18:25.193
A SHIFTING STATE YOU HAVE A I'M

03:18:25.260 --> 03:18:26.494
JUST THINKING ABOUT THE TALES OF

03:18:26.561 --> 03:18:27.895
OBVIOUSLY WHAT OUR PRIORITIES

03:18:27.962 --> 03:18:29.564
THE THE THE THE CLIENT THE

03:18:29.631 --> 03:18:30.999
BENEFICIARY RIGHT IN THERE.

03:18:31.065 --> 03:18:31.666
AND HOW THEY HAVE TO MANAGE THAT

03:18:31.733 --> 03:18:32.700
I'M ALSO THINKING FROM THE IF

03:18:32.767 --> 03:18:33.768
YOU'RE A CHILD CARE PROVIDER NOW

03:18:33.835 --> 03:18:35.303
I REALIZE THE COUNTY RUNS AROUND

03:18:35.370 --> 03:18:36.004
ETCETERA.

03:18:36.070 --> 03:18:36.771
I THINK YOU THE COST OF RUNNING

03:18:36.838 --> 03:18:39.140
IT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING

03:18:39.207 --> 03:18:40.375
IN WHO BASICALLY.

03:18:40.441 --> 03:18:41.609
THEIR THEIR HOURS ARE CONSTANTLY

03:18:41.676 --> 03:18:43.311
SHIFTING BECAUSE YOU NEED TO

03:18:43.378 --> 03:18:47.181
MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL

03:18:47.248 --> 03:18:49.284
INFRASTRUCTURE NOW.

03:18:49.350 --> 03:18:50.918
AND AND IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE YOU

03:18:50.985 --> 03:18:52.086
HAVE OF GROUP OF CLASS I GO THE

03:18:52.153 --> 03:18:53.221
THE MATCH LIKE PUZZLE PIECES

03:18:53.288 --> 03:18:54.656
RIGHT SO BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT

03:18:54.722 --> 03:18:55.623
YOU MAY SOME THE HAVE A LARGER

03:18:55.690 --> 03:18:57.392
ENTRIES AND IT'S ONLY DROP RIGHT

03:18:57.458 --> 03:18:58.593
SO I AM ONE LEVEL BECAUSE A WELL

03:18:58.660 --> 03:18:59.093
WELL WE ONLY WE SHOULD.

03:18:59.160 --> 03:18:59.761
PAY FOR CHILD CARE ONLY FOR THE

03:18:59.827 --> 03:19:02.030
TIME THAT THEY NEED FOR VERY

03:19:02.096 --> 03:19:04.098
SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AND BUT IT

03:19:04.165 --> 03:19:04.966
SLIPS I'M THINKING IS THAT CHILD

03:19:05.033 --> 03:19:06.034
CARE GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE

03:19:06.100 --> 03:19:07.168
JUST BECAUSE A CHILD CARE

03:19:07.235 --> 03:19:08.836
PROVIDER HAS TO MAINTAIN A

03:19:08.903 --> 03:19:09.904
CERTAIN LEVEL I MEAN THEY DON'T

03:19:09.971 --> 03:19:11.406
HAVE CERTAIN TO EITHER SO.

03:19:11.472 --> 03:19:12.507
HOW THE HOW MUCH STAFF TO THEY

03:19:12.573 --> 03:19:14.309
HAVE HOW MUCH SPACE TO THE HAVE

03:19:14.375 --> 03:19:16.144
HOW MUCH SUPPLIES TODAY I MEAN

03:19:16.210 --> 03:19:17.478
I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IF I WAS

03:19:17.545 --> 03:19:19.247
A BUSINESS PERSON WHO HAD RUN

03:19:19.314 --> 03:19:20.581
THE CHILD CARE BUT THERE AND

03:19:20.648 --> 03:19:20.782
THAT?

03:19:20.848 --> 03:19:21.349
IS PERSON BECAUSE I OWN THE

03:19:21.416 --> 03:19:22.850
CHILD CARE OR EVEN JUST ON THE

03:19:22.917 --> 03:19:24.886
MANAGER FOR THE STATE HE FOR THE

03:19:24.952 --> 03:19:28.156
EIGHT COUNTY AGENCY THAT HAS TO

03:19:28.222 --> 03:19:29.824
MAINTAIN A CHILD CARE FACILITY.

03:19:29.891 --> 03:19:30.458
I WONDER IF SOMEONE LOOKED AT

03:19:30.525 --> 03:19:31.092
HOW WHAT THE COST OF DOING THAT

03:19:31.159 --> 03:19:32.827
WHEN YOU HAVE THIS.

03:19:32.894 --> 03:19:36.531
THIS VERY ABILITY -- TO YET IN

03:19:36.597 --> 03:19:39.701
IN IN YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR UP AT

03:19:39.767 --> 03:19:40.468
EIGHT EIGHT IS YOUR CLIENT ADDED

03:19:40.535 --> 03:19:41.269
THE NUMBER KIDS YOU HALF RIGHT

03:19:41.336 --> 03:19:42.970
AND AND AND THE AND THE RANGE OF

03:19:43.037 --> 03:19:44.872
THE AGES CELL.

03:19:44.939 --> 03:19:47.141
IT IS I'M JUST SORRY I'M STATE

03:19:47.208 --> 03:19:49.610
YES -- ABOUT THAT I DID HAVE A

03:19:49.677 --> 03:19:51.112
RACK SCHEDULE LIKE THAT TO HER --

03:19:51.179 --> 03:19:51.946
LIKE MY JANITOR JOB I WAS

03:19:52.013 --> 03:19:54.082
WORKING FOR PM TO THREE AM AND

03:19:54.148 --> 03:19:54.716
THEN I HAD ANOTHER JOB THAT WAS

03:19:54.782 --> 03:19:56.017
ON CALL.

03:19:56.084 --> 03:19:57.151
I COULD PUT MY KID AN ACTUAL THE

03:19:57.218 --> 03:19:58.486
FACILITY I HAD TO GO THROUGH A

03:19:58.553 --> 03:20:00.288
FAMILY MEMBER AND HAVE THEM.

03:20:00.355 --> 03:20:02.190
BUT ON MY CONTRACTS THEY

03:20:02.256 --> 03:20:04.292
ACTUALLY HAD PUT VARIOUS TIMES

03:20:04.359 --> 03:20:05.927
THEY COULDN'T PUT LIKE SET TIMES

03:20:05.993 --> 03:20:08.930
FOR MY IMAGE FOR A JOB THAT WAS

03:20:08.996 --> 03:20:10.164
ON CALL.

03:20:10.231 --> 03:20:10.832
SO THEY KNEW THAT THERE IS AN TO

03:20:10.898 --> 03:20:12.500
BE SOME VARIOUS TIMES IN THERE

03:20:12.567 --> 03:20:14.102
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PAY MY

03:20:14.168 --> 03:20:15.370
MY FAMILY MEMBER.

03:20:15.436 --> 03:20:16.738
FOR THE FOR THE JANITORIAL JOB

03:20:16.804 --> 03:20:21.676
IT WAS JUST BETWEEN THOSE TIMES

03:20:21.743 --> 03:20:22.443
THAT THEY WOULD PAY [inaudible]

03:20:22.510 --> 03:20:22.977
FOR OKAY.

03:20:23.044 --> 03:20:23.845
I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT FOR

03:20:23.911 --> 03:20:25.580
ANYONE WHO HAS -- IN

03:20:25.646 --> 03:20:27.715
INTERMITTENT SCHEDULE A VARIABLE

03:20:27.782 --> 03:20:29.450
SCHEDULE NONTRADITIONAL HOURS

03:20:29.517 --> 03:20:31.853
THE ONLY OPTION IS -- LICENSE

03:20:31.919 --> 03:20:33.321
EXAM TO A FAMILY FRIEND AND

03:20:33.388 --> 03:20:35.790
NEIGHBOR CARE AND WHEN YOU SAY

03:20:35.857 --> 03:20:37.225
WELL WOULDN'T THEY HAVE TO BE

03:20:37.291 --> 03:20:39.093
PAID MORE TO HOLD THAT SPACE

03:20:39.160 --> 03:20:42.130
OPEN THE ANSWER IS THAT THE

03:20:42.196 --> 03:20:42.330
STATE.

03:20:42.397 --> 03:20:43.264
SETS A CEILING ON HARASSMENT

03:20:43.331 --> 03:20:45.867
RATES SO THAT IS NOT AN OPTION

03:20:45.933 --> 03:20:48.336
AND AS A RESULT -- WE THINK THAT

03:20:48.403 --> 03:20:49.437
CREATING TWELVE MONTH

03:20:49.504 --> 03:20:51.305
ELIGIBILITY AND THE OPTION OF

03:20:51.372 --> 03:20:53.241
FULL TIME CARE MEANS THAT

03:20:53.307 --> 03:20:55.109
PARENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO A

03:20:55.176 --> 03:20:57.612
FULLER RANGE OF LICENSED QUALITY

03:20:57.678 --> 03:20:59.680
CHILDCARE OPTIONS THAT IS NOT

03:20:59.747 --> 03:21:01.282
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF

03:21:01.349 --> 03:21:02.917
JUST THE A PROBLEMS YOU'VE

03:21:02.984 --> 03:21:04.786
IDENTIFIED AT WAS A MORE

03:21:04.852 --> 03:21:05.686
EXPENSIVE.

03:21:05.753 --> 03:21:08.389
IT'S DRAIN YOUR WILL SO WHAT WE

03:21:08.456 --> 03:21:09.023
DO IS A STATE WE CAP THAT REYES

03:21:09.090 --> 03:21:09.991
SO BUT THE PROBLEM IS I'M SAYING

03:21:10.057 --> 03:21:11.592
THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY OPERATED

03:21:11.659 --> 03:21:12.260
AND SAYS WELL I CAN'T TAKE IT'S

03:21:12.326 --> 03:21:13.094
LIKE THAT.

03:21:13.161 --> 03:21:14.495
BECAUSE IT WILL COST ME MORE

03:21:14.562 --> 03:21:17.365
IT'S NOT YOU KNOW AND AND AND

03:21:17.432 --> 03:21:17.999
IT'S GONNA COST ME MORE THAN TO

03:21:18.065 --> 03:21:19.267
AND JUST TRY TO WALK THROUGH THE

03:21:19.333 --> 03:21:25.807
PROBLEM AND JUST THINKING ABOUT.

03:21:25.873 --> 03:21:26.474
YOU KNOW HOW TO BE SURE WE BUILD

03:21:26.541 --> 03:21:27.708
THAT CAPACITY FOR AVAILABLE

03:21:27.775 --> 03:21:32.413
CHILD CARE -- AND AND THEN FOR

03:21:32.480 --> 03:21:34.449
IT SO IT IS SOMETIMES SOMEONE

03:21:34.515 --> 03:21:36.250
BEING WHETHER REPAYING AND AGAIN

03:21:36.317 --> 03:21:36.951
I'M.

03:21:37.018 --> 03:21:39.053
THAT ARE SORT OF RUN NUMBERS

03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:39.887
ANYTHING BUT I'VE WAS EYES

03:21:39.954 --> 03:21:40.955
WONDER WHETHER BEING PENNY WISE

03:21:41.022 --> 03:21:41.789
POUND FOOLISH SIX I COULD SEE

03:21:41.856 --> 03:21:42.990
PEOPLE SAID WELL YOU KNOW THIS

03:21:43.057 --> 03:21:43.791
IS THE WAY TO SAVE MONEY WHICH

03:21:43.858 --> 03:21:44.592
ONLY PROVIDE CHILDCARE FOR VERY

03:21:44.659 --> 03:21:46.327
SPECIFIC THINGS BECAUSE THAT

03:21:46.394 --> 03:21:47.061
MAKE.

03:21:47.128 --> 03:21:48.529
IT WOULD WHILE SPEND MONEY ON

03:21:48.596 --> 03:21:49.564
DOUBT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE

03:21:49.630 --> 03:21:50.398
TO KIDS OF THOSE OTHER TIMES AND

03:21:50.465 --> 03:21:51.632
YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE PAYING FOR

03:21:51.699 --> 03:21:52.900
IT BUT IN THE END IF YOU'RE

DEPENDING ON THAT UNIVERSE OF

03:21:54.969 --> 03:21:55.303
THINGS.

03:21:55.369 --> 03:21:56.771
YOU MAY END UP WITH A SITUATION

03:21:56.838 --> 03:21:59.040

CONVERSATIONS AND BELIEVE IT.

03:25:31.352 --> 03:25:32.486

IN THE GOVERNOR.

ALSO THE BUDGET PROPOSES

03:26:13.761 --> 03:26:15.663
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE -- TO THE

IMPACT OF THOSE GRANTS.

03:26:36.217 --> 03:26:37.318
THE QUESTION IS WHAT PERCENTAGE

03:26:37.384 --> 03:26:39.887
OF A USE INCLUDE THE INELIGIBLE.

03:26:39.954 --> 03:26:41.689
UNNEEDED FAMILY MEMBERS -- THE

03:26:41.756 --> 03:26:43.124
CONCENTRATION OF THOSE CASES

WITHOUT -- IN A TO THE DOLE IS

03:26:45.893 --> 03:26:50.131
MOSTLY IN A YOU OF ONE

03:26:50.197 --> 03:26:52.333
APPROXIMATELY 80% OF EIGHT OF A

ON AN EIGHT EIGHT ADULT.

03:26:55.770 --> 03:26:57.104
BASED ON THE MAP LEVELS AFTER

03:26:57.171 --> 03:26:58.305
THIS OCTOBER FIRST THE TWENTY

27% OF CASES -- WILL BE OUT --

03:27:02.610 --> 03:27:03.811
BELOW THE FRONT AND FEDERAL

03:27:03.878 --> 03:27:04.712
POVERTY LEVEL AND CONSIDERED

03:27:04.779 --> 03:27:07.014
KIND OF THE FURTHEST AWAY FROM

03:27:07.081 --> 03:27:09.650
THAT 50% TARGET -- THAT 27%

03:27:09.717 --> 03:27:12.086
REPRESENTS PRIMARILY A USE OF

03:27:12.153 --> 03:27:14.321
ONE OF THE SOME SMALL PERCENTAGE

03:27:14.388 --> 03:27:14.922
ADDITIONS OF A USE OF EIGHT OR

03:27:14.989 --> 03:27:17.158
MORE.

03:27:17.224 --> 03:27:18.492
WITH REGARDS TO THE QUESTION ON

03:27:18.559 --> 03:27:20.728
THE LA OWES THIRD OPTION E DO

03:27:20.795 --> 03:27:21.128
BELIEVE IT CAN BE

03:27:21.195 --> 03:27:22.830
OPERATIONALIZED THIS PROPOSAL

03:27:22.897 --> 03:27:24.365
WOULD WOULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

03:27:24.431 --> 03:27:25.599
INCREASE IN FUNDING OVER WHAT'S

03:27:25.666 --> 03:27:26.867
BEEN PROPOSED IN THE CURRENT

03:27:26.934 --> 03:27:27.468
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET [inaudible]

03:27:27.535 --> 03:27:30.304
OKAY.

03:27:30.371 --> 03:27:31.472
ALLEVIATE SOME COMMENTS THAT AND

03:27:31.539 --> 03:27:33.974
ALSO QUESTION FOR YOU DIFFERENT

03:27:34.041 --> 03:27:36.477
OPTIONS YES THANK YOU.

03:27:36.544 --> 03:27:37.912
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED THIRTEEN

03:27:37.978 --> 03:27:40.347
POINT 1% ACROSS THE BOARD GRAN

03:27:40.414 --> 03:27:43.050
INCREASE DIFFERS IN SEVERAL KEY

03:27:43.117 --> 03:27:44.752
RESPECTS FROM THE LAN THAT WAS

03:27:44.819 --> 03:27:47.087
ADOPTED AS PART OF THE EIGHTEEN

03:27:47.154 --> 03:27:47.688
NINETEEN BUDGET ACT.

03:27:47.755 --> 03:27:49.557
IN OUR VIEW IT'S CLEARLY A STEP

03:27:49.623 --> 03:27:52.126
IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND SO IS

03:27:52.193 --> 03:27:54.028
AN INCOMPATIBLE -- WE THINK THE%

03:27:54.094 --> 03:27:55.596
LEGISLATURE SHOULD AND THE

03:27:55.663 --> 03:27:56.964
SUBCOMMITTEE SHOULD CONSIDER

03:27:57.031 --> 03:27:58.732
SORT OF ITS OPTIONS IN

03:27:58.799 --> 03:28:00.734
RECONCILING THE DIFFERENCE

03:28:00.801 --> 03:28:03.737
BETWEEN THE TWO PLANS -- THE

03:28:03.804 --> 03:28:05.472
GOVERNOR'S APPROACH APPROACH IS

03:28:05.539 --> 03:28:07.107
ACROSS THE BOARD TO EACH.

03:28:07.174 --> 03:28:09.577
ARE A YOU WOULD RECEIVE A GRANT

03:28:09.643 --> 03:28:10.444
INCREASE OF THE SAME PERCENTAGE

03:28:10.511 --> 03:28:11.178
AMOUNT.

03:28:11.245 --> 03:28:12.847
ON THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN THE

03:28:12.913 --> 03:28:14.248
GRANT INCREASES WOULD BE

03:28:14.315 --> 03:28:16.650
DISTRIBUTED DIFFERENTLY.

03:28:16.717 --> 03:28:19.220
IN IN SPECIFICALLY A LARGER

03:28:19.286 --> 03:28:19.687
GRANT INCREASE WILL BE

03:28:19.753 --> 03:28:21.121
DISTRIBUTED TO IN PARTICULAR THE

03:28:21.188 --> 03:28:23.157
A USE OF ONE WHICH UNDER CURRENT

03:28:23.224 --> 03:28:26.227
LAW ARE FURTHEST FROM 50% OF THE

03:28:26.293 --> 03:28:28.095
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. TO SORT

03:28:28.162 --> 03:28:30.998
OF AN OPTION OF WHICH DIRECTION

03:28:31.065 --> 03:28:34.635
TO TO FOLLOW AS PART OF THIS

03:28:34.702 --> 03:28:38.038
YEAR'S BUDGET -- WE THINK THERE

03:28:38.105 --> 03:28:39.039
ARE A COUPLE ALTERNATIVES TO THE

03:28:39.106 --> 03:28:40.641
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT THE

03:28:40.708 --> 03:28:41.408
LEGISLATURE CAN COULD CONSIDER

03:28:41.475 --> 03:28:43.544
IF IT WANTED TO PURSUE -- NOW

03:28:43.611 --> 03:28:44.979
COM THAT WAS MORE CLOSELY

03:28:45.045 --> 03:28:46.447
ALIGNED WITH ITS EIGHTEEN

03:28:46.513 --> 03:28:47.848
NINETEEN BUDGET PLAN HOT ONE

03:28:47.915 --> 03:28:50.117
OPTION IS TO WORK WITHIN THE THE

03:28:50.184 --> 03:28:51.518
PROPOSED BUDGETARY AMOUNT THAT

03:28:51.585 --> 03:28:53.687
THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. FOR

03:28:53.754 --> 03:28:55.356
THE BUDGET YEAR BUT INSTEAD OF

03:28:55.422 --> 03:28:56.156
PROVIDING A GRAND INCREASE

03:28:56.223 --> 03:28:58.392
ACROSS THE BOARD DISTRIBUTE

03:28:58.459 --> 03:29:01.262
THOSE SORT OF TARGETED IN A

03:29:01.328 --> 03:29:04.665
TARGETED FASHION SUCH THAT ALL.

03:29:04.732 --> 03:29:05.432
ALL A USER PART GRAHAM LEVELS

03:29:05.499 --> 03:29:06.567
ARE BROUGHT TO THE SAME

03:29:06.634 --> 03:29:07.268
PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL

03:29:07.334 --> 03:29:08.769
POVERTY LEVEL WE THINK THAT

03:29:08.836 --> 03:29:12.239
WOULD BE ABOUT 48% OF THE FPL

03:29:12.306 --> 03:29:13.507
THAT'S ONE OPTION --

03:29:13.574 --> 03:29:14.775
ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE

03:29:14.842 --> 03:29:17.778
COULD MOVE FORWARD WITH ITS --

03:29:17.845 --> 03:29:20.247
PLAN AS OUTLINED IS IN PART OF

03:29:20.314 --> 03:29:22.616
THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET

03:29:22.683 --> 03:29:22.816
ACTS.

03:29:22.883 --> 03:29:23.550
THAT WOULD.

03:29:23.617 --> 03:29:26.020
OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD INCREASE

03:29:26.086 --> 03:29:28.222
GRANT LEVELS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER

03:29:28.289 --> 03:29:29.156
THAN WHAT IS PROPOSED ON THE

03:29:29.223 --> 03:29:30.391
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS A

03:29:30.457 --> 03:29:32.326
DEPARTMENT MENTIONED -- BECAUSE

03:29:32.393 --> 03:29:34.328
NOT ONLY WOULD GRANT LEVELS BE

03:29:34.395 --> 03:29:37.131
INCREASED 250% OF THE FPL UNDER

03:29:37.197 --> 03:29:39.099
THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN IT WOULD

03:29:39.166 --> 03:29:40.000
BE 50% THE F. P. L. THAT

03:29:40.067 --> 03:29:41.035
CORRESPONDS.

03:29:41.101 --> 03:29:42.369
WITH THE FAMILY THAT'S ONE

03:29:42.436 --> 03:29:44.505
PERSON LARGER THAN THE COW WORKS

03:29:44.571 --> 03:29:47.041
ASSISTANCE UNIT ARE MINDFUL THAT

03:29:47.107 --> 03:29:49.343
MANY CAO WORKS CASES DO INCLUDE

03:29:49.410 --> 03:29:51.078
IN AN ELIGIBLE FAMILY MEMBER --

03:29:51.145 --> 03:29:52.780
SO THERE'S A SORT OF THE OPTIONS

03:29:52.846 --> 03:29:54.548
BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE HAPPY TO

03:29:54.615 --> 03:29:57.284

WHOSE EXACTLY THE KIND OF CASE

03:30:11.966 --> 03:30:13.734
IS THAT -- THE ONLY -- JUST

03:30:13.801 --> 03:30:16.704
DESCRIBED -- WHERE WE HAD SHE

03:30:16.770 --> 03:30:18.105
CHAIR IT WAS DURING THAT AND SHE

03:30:18.172 --> 03:30:18.872
IS THAT SHE'S SINGLE DAUGHTER

03:30:18.939 --> 03:30:20.507
BUT SHE'S TIME OFF OF THE

03:30:20.574 --> 03:30:22.209
SYSTEMS SHE SAID HER FORTY EIGHT

03:30:22.276 --> 03:30:22.743
MONTH LIMIT?

03:30:22.810 --> 03:30:24.044
SOMETHING WE HOPE YOU'LL ADDRESS

03:30:24.111 --> 03:30:25.512
DURING THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BY THE

03:30:25.579 --> 03:30:29.249
WAY -- BUT UNDER THE UNDER THE

03:30:29.316 --> 03:30:30.651
PROPOSAL PUT FORTH BY THE

03:30:30.718 --> 03:30:32.453
GOVERNOR -- HER GRANT LEVEL

03:30:32.519 --> 03:30:34.021
WOULD STILL BE I BELIEVE IT

03:30:34.088 --> 03:30:35.556
FORTY TWO OR 43% OF THE FEDERAL

03:30:35.622 --> 03:30:37.891
POVERTY LEVEL AND AGAIN WE ARE

03:30:37.958 --> 03:30:39.827
REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE

03:30:39.893 --> 03:30:40.627
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON

03:30:40.694 --> 03:30:41.362
THIS.

03:30:41.428 --> 03:30:43.263
WE JUST HAD A 10% GRANT INCREASE

03:30:43.330 --> 03:30:45.933
NOW WE HAVE A 13% INCREASE.

03:30:46.000 --> 03:30:47.301
ON TOP OF THAT IN THE SAME

03:30:47.368 --> 03:30:48.602
CALENDAR YEAR.

03:30:48.669 --> 03:30:50.504
THESE ARE REALLY HUGE STEPS THAT

03:30:50.571 --> 03:30:51.905
WERE MAKING AND IT'S GOING TO

03:30:51.972 --> 03:30:53.374
MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN

03:30:53.440 --> 03:30:56.243
PEOPLE'S LIVES -- HOWEVER WE

03:30:56.310 --> 03:30:57.444
WOULD PREFER THE APPROACH I

03:30:57.511 --> 03:30:58.679
THINK THAT WAS.

03:30:58.746 --> 03:30:59.980
PUT FORTH BY THE LEGISLATURE

03:31:00.047 --> 03:31:02.182
LAST YEAR IN WHICH WE WOULD

03:31:02.249 --> 03:31:04.251
RAISE GRANT LEVELS EXPRESSLY FOR

03:31:04.318 --> 03:31:05.786
AND WHAT WE THINK ARE VERY

03:31:05.853 --> 03:31:07.654
VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS OF STUFF

03:31:07.721 --> 03:31:08.922
BUT I'VE DESCRIBED AS SORT OF A

03:31:08.989 --> 03:31:10.057
LEGAL FICTION.

03:31:10.124 --> 03:31:11.425
THAT THESE ARE HOUSEHOLDS OF ONE

03:31:11.492 --> 03:31:12.793
IN FACT THERE ARE NO SUCH THING

03:31:12.860 --> 03:31:14.028
THEY'RE ALWAYS AT LEAST A TWO

03:31:14.094 --> 03:31:15.829
PERSON HOUSEHOLD AND THE PATH OF

03:31:15.896 --> 03:31:17.765
THE LEGISLATURE'S ESTABLISHED

03:31:17.831 --> 03:31:19.166
LAST YEAR WOULD BE INCREASE YOU

03:31:19.233 --> 03:31:20.968
WOULD BE PUTTING MORE FUNDING

03:31:21.035 --> 03:31:22.503
INCREASING THOSE GRANT LEVELS

03:31:22.569 --> 03:31:23.137
HIGHER.

03:31:23.203 --> 03:31:25.539
AND THEN IN TWO YEARS OUT WE

03:31:25.606 --> 03:31:27.307
WOULD BE GETTING TO WHAT THE LA --

03:31:27.374 --> 03:31:30.611
DESCRIBE WHICH WOULD BE 50% PLUS

03:31:30.677 --> 03:31:32.312
ONE ADDITIONAL PERSON IN THAT.

03:31:32.379 --> 03:31:33.747
CASE LOAD AND THAT WOULD MAKE

03:31:33.814 --> 03:31:34.882
SURE THAT.

03:31:34.948 --> 03:31:37.551
NO FAMILY EVEN WHERE WE HAVE AN

03:31:37.618 --> 03:31:39.153
EXCLUDED ADULT.

03:31:39.219 --> 03:31:40.954
IS BELOW 50% OF THE FEDERAL

03:31:41.021 --> 03:31:42.523
POVERTY LEVEL AND THAT'S WHAT

03:31:42.589 --> 03:31:44.625
WAS THE LEGISLATURE DROVE TOWARD

03:31:44.691 --> 03:31:45.993
IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR.

03:31:46.060 --> 03:31:47.728
AND WHILE WE AGAIN APPRECIATE

03:31:47.795 --> 03:31:49.563
THE GOVERNOR TAKING A VERY LARGE

03:31:49.630 --> 03:31:51.999
IMPORTANT STEP THIS YEAR -- WE

03:31:52.066 --> 03:31:53.667
WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP WITH

03:31:53.734 --> 03:32:01.275
THE DEAL AND TO PUT A LITTLE BIT

03:32:01.341 --> 03:32:01.909
MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET IN THIS

03:32:01.975 --> 03:32:03.377
YEAR SO WE STAY ON THAT PATH TO

03:32:03.444 --> 03:32:05.145
GET TO WHERE WE AGREE TO LAST

03:32:05.212 --> 03:32:05.345
YEAR.

03:32:05.412 --> 03:32:07.014
SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S OUR THAT'S

03:32:07.081 --> 03:32:07.748
WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHIEF

03:32:07.815 --> 03:32:08.515
THIS YEAR.

03:32:08.582 --> 03:32:09.049
THANK YOU THAT COMES FROM

03:32:09.116 --> 03:32:11.952
FINANCE.

03:32:12.019 --> 03:32:14.488
IT'S ONLY IT'S A QUESTION -- SO.

03:32:14.555 --> 03:32:15.089
THE PRE SHEET FIRST OF ALL I

03:32:15.155 --> 03:32:16.623
THINK GOVERNOR -- FOR FOR FOR

03:32:16.690 --> 03:32:17.624
RELATIONAL INCREASE -- AND IS

03:32:17.691 --> 03:32:19.093
PROPOSAL AND CERTAINLY THAT'S

03:32:19.159 --> 03:32:20.127
SOMETHING I THINK WE'RE IN

03:32:20.194 --> 03:32:23.097
LEGISLATURE'S VERY OPEN.

03:32:23.163 --> 03:32:25.999

03:32:28.936 --> 03:32:31.038
CROSS THE BOARD CUT ONLY SAYS

03:32:31.105 --> 03:32:32.673
HISTORICAL CONTENT I MEAN IT

WEISS'S STRUGGLE REASON THE YOU

03:32:47.287 --> 03:32:49.323
ONE IS SO FAR BEHIND.

03:32:49.389 --> 03:32:50.023
THIS WAS A POLICY THAT DROVE

03:32:50.090 --> 03:32:52.860
THAT OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE I

03:32:52.926 --> 03:32:53.861

03:33:00.734 --> 03:33:01.668
INCREASE.

03:33:01.735 --> 03:33:02.703
THE REASON -- BEHIND BECAUSE

03:33:02.769 --> 03:33:04.037
THEY WERE STARTED BEHIND SO WHY

03:33:04.104 --> 03:33:06.673
A WISE AN EIGHTY ONE SO FAR

03:33:06.740 --> 03:33:10.210
BELOW EVERYONE ELSE.

03:33:10.277 --> 03:33:11.845
NOW YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION --

03:33:11.912 --> 03:33:14.314
THIS IS LONG AS I'VE BEEN

03:33:14.381 --> 03:33:15.749
WORKING AT CAL WORKS GRANTS

03:33:15.816 --> 03:33:17.084
GOING BACK AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS

03:33:17.151 --> 03:33:19.353
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ALWAYS BEEN

03:33:19.419 --> 03:33:21.355
THE CASE -- IT WAS A DECISION

03:33:21.421 --> 03:33:23.457
MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE NGUYEN

03:33:23.524 --> 03:33:25.826
IN THE OLD A FDC DAYS -- IT AND

03:33:25.893 --> 03:33:27.060
IT'S A DECISION THAT THIS LET

03:33:27.127 --> 03:33:28.362
THE CURRENT LEGISLATURE COULD

03:33:28.428 --> 03:33:31.165
CHOOSE TO FIX IT'S JUST A POLICY

03:33:31.231 --> 03:33:32.466
AND BUDGETARY DECISION.

03:33:32.533 --> 03:33:34.701
THAT HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME

03:33:34.768 --> 03:33:36.703
UNFORTUNATELY AND ONE THAT WE

03:33:36.770 --> 03:33:37.971
HOPE IS GOING TO GET REVISITED

03:33:38.038 --> 03:33:40.073
OKAY SO THIS IS A REALLY LONG

03:33:40.140 --> 03:33:41.108
STANDING AREA.

03:33:41.175 --> 03:33:43.243
OKAY I'M GONNA SPECULATE BECAUSE

03:33:43.310 --> 03:33:44.578
I WAS A DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE

03:33:44.645 --> 03:33:46.313
SPECULATE THAT IF IT WAS THAT

03:33:46.380 --> 03:33:48.782
LONG AGO THAT PROBABLY PEOPLE

03:33:48.849 --> 03:33:50.417
SAID -- YOU KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY

03:33:50.484 --> 03:33:52.152
A SINGLE.

03:33:52.219 --> 03:33:54.621
PERSON DOESN'T HAVE KIDS WE

03:33:54.688 --> 03:33:56.089
DON'T KNOW WE'RE WORRIED WE

03:33:56.156 --> 03:33:57.958
THOUGHT OF A LOSS OF THE FEE AND

03:33:58.025 --> 03:33:58.692
THAT THEY SHOULD GET ON FULL OF

03:33:58.759 --> 03:33:59.493
THEIR BOOTSTRAPS AND GET THE

03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:00.661
WORK IS THAT -- PERHAPS WAS

03:34:00.727 --> 03:34:02.095
GOING ON BACK THEN THAT'S BEFORE

03:34:02.162 --> 03:34:04.164
LIMITS TO WHERE PEOPLE WITH SO I

03:34:04.231 --> 03:34:05.799
DON'T KNOW IS THAT MY GUESSING

03:34:05.866 --> 03:34:06.967
WRONG MAYBE.

03:34:07.034 --> 03:34:07.868
THE GAP BETWEEN THE ONE PERSON

03:34:07.935 --> 03:34:09.603
IN THE TWO PERSON HOUSEHOLD SIDE

03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:11.471
IS WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

03:34:11.538 --> 03:34:14.241
IT'S SUCH A LARGE GAP IT'S HARD

03:34:14.308 --> 03:34:15.642
EVEN JUST TO FIND THE GROUNDS A

03:34:15.709 --> 03:34:17.110
YOU JUST DELIVERED.

03:34:17.177 --> 03:34:18.212
HI HI.

03:34:18.278 --> 03:34:19.947
I THINK YOU PROBABLY AT SOME

03:34:20.013 --> 03:34:22.883
POINT WAS BASED ON THE ON THE

03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:25.085
OLD STANDARD THAT WE HAD AROUND

03:34:25.152 --> 03:34:27.087
THE THE EMBASSY SACK AS WE CALL

03:34:27.154 --> 03:34:28.789
IT THE MINIMUM BASIC STANDARD

03:34:28.855 --> 03:34:35.128
ADEQUATE CARE.

03:34:35.195 --> 03:34:38.432
AND THAT -- WAS SOMEWHAT CLOSELY

03:34:38.498 --> 03:34:39.666
ALIGNED WITH THE POVERTY LEVEL

03:34:39.733 --> 03:34:41.435
FOR THAT INCOME SIZE AS OF

03:34:41.501 --> 03:34:42.436
POVERTY WEALTH OF ADJUSTED

03:34:42.502 --> 03:34:44.037
OVERTIME AND WE'VE STOP USING

03:34:44.104 --> 03:34:45.072
THE OF THE SACK AS A WAY BE

03:34:45.138 --> 03:34:45.706
SECOND RANTS.

03:34:45.772 --> 03:34:47.140
THINGS I THINK JUST GOT EXTENDED

03:34:47.207 --> 03:34:50.711
OUT OF WHACK OVER TIME OKAY.

03:34:50.777 --> 03:34:52.679
SO LET ME JUST SAID AND LET ME

03:34:52.746 --> 03:34:54.715
POSE QUESTION DIRECTED IS

03:34:54.781 --> 03:34:56.717
ANSWERED IT I DON'T KNOW YEAH

03:34:56.783 --> 03:34:57.317
I'LL TRY THE EASIEST THING IS

03:34:57.384 --> 03:34:58.685
LET'S DEAL WITH IT WE HAVE MONEY

03:34:58.752 --> 03:35:00.554
WILL DO OAK TREES ACROSS THE

03:35:00.621 --> 03:35:01.154
BOARD I MEAN THIS THIS THE IN

03:35:01.221 --> 03:35:01.989
TERMS OF POLICY.

03:35:02.055 --> 03:35:04.024
ISSUE HAVING THIS DISPARITY

03:35:04.091 --> 03:35:04.825
BETWEEN AN EIGHTY ONE AND FOR

03:35:04.891 --> 03:35:06.126
WHATEVER HISTORICAL REASONS I

03:35:06.193 --> 03:35:06.660
SAID I'D TO SPECULATE NO

03:35:06.727 --> 03:35:10.530
EVIDENCE FOR ANYTHING AND I

03:35:10.597 --> 03:35:12.132
THINK YOU BROUGHT SOME OTHER.

03:35:12.199 --> 03:35:12.699
POINTS UP BUT AGAIN REALLY

03:35:12.766 --> 03:35:15.402
HISTORICAL -- DO IS -- POLICY

03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:16.069
ISSUE WITH SAYING THAT WE SHOULD

03:35:16.136 --> 03:35:18.071
TRY TO GET THE YOU KNOW EVEN

03:35:18.138 --> 03:35:19.740
THIS AT IN TERMS OF GETTING A

03:35:19.806 --> 03:35:21.408
YOU ONE OUT -- SO THAT WE DON'T

03:35:21.475 --> 03:35:22.676
HAVE SUCH A DISPARITY BETWEEN

03:35:22.743 --> 03:35:25.412
THE DIFFERENT -- THAT SYSTEM

03:35:25.479 --> 03:35:26.613
UNIT SIZES.

03:35:26.680 --> 03:35:28.315
A I THINK TO AT WHAT MR ALAMO

03:35:28.382 --> 03:35:30.550
OUTLINED IN LA WAS OUTLINED HERE --

03:35:30.617 --> 03:35:31.585
I THINK THAT'S THOSE ARE THE

03:35:31.652 --> 03:35:33.120
CHOICES THAT THAT CAN BE MADE

03:35:33.186 --> 03:35:34.187
SIX CERTAINLY WILLING TO

03:35:34.254 --> 03:35:35.389
CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

03:35:35.455 --> 03:35:35.889
BUT I JUST CHECKING THE

03:35:35.956 --> 03:35:37.157
MINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE ANY

03:35:37.224 --> 03:35:38.725
POLICY ISSUES WITH THE IDEA OF

03:35:38.792 --> 03:35:39.893
TRYING.

03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:40.861
TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN

03:35:40.927 --> 03:35:42.796
ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS THAT WE

03:35:42.863 --> 03:35:43.697
BASICALLY SAID WE DON'T THERE'S

03:35:43.764 --> 03:35:44.698
NO POLICY REASON TO HAVE A

03:35:44.765 --> 03:35:49.169
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF RELATIVE --

03:35:49.236 --> 03:35:50.304
BENEFITS FOR DIFFERENT SIZE

03:35:50.370 --> 03:35:55.309
ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS.

03:35:55.375 --> 03:35:56.343
I THINK AT THIS POINT WE

03:35:56.410 --> 03:35:57.210
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON

03:35:57.277 --> 03:35:59.379
THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT I WOULD

03:35:59.446 --> 03:36:01.181
SAY THAT THAT THIRTEEN POINT 1%

03:36:01.248 --> 03:36:02.282
ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN IT WAS

03:36:02.349 --> 03:36:04.651
ORIGINALLY PROPOSED LAST WAS.

03:36:04.718 --> 03:36:06.219
TARGETING THOSE HOUSEHOLDS OF

03:36:06.286 --> 03:36:08.055
TWO AND THREE WHICH MAKE UP OVER

03:36:08.121 --> 03:36:10.390
HALF OF THE CAL WORKS CASELOAD.

03:36:10.457 --> 03:36:12.926
BUT WE COULD CERTAINLY REVISIT

03:36:12.993 --> 03:36:15.362
IF IT'S LEGISLATURE'S INTENT TO

03:36:15.429 --> 03:36:18.732
REDISTRIBUTE THAT OKAY WELL I I

03:36:18.799 --> 03:36:20.667
YOU KNOW I I SAW THE DIVINE

03:36:20.734 --> 03:36:21.902
LEVELS THE MONEY WHICH OBVIOUSLY

03:36:21.968 --> 03:36:22.769
IS BUDGET COMMITTEE WE HAVE TO

03:36:22.836 --> 03:36:24.271
DEAL WITH THAT FIVE ALSO THERE'S

03:36:24.338 --> 03:36:25.806
AN UNDERLYING POLICY ISSUE RIGHT.

03:36:25.872 --> 03:36:28.942
AND I THINK -- AND THEN THEIR

03:36:29.009 --> 03:36:30.510
HEAD ASSESS PRICE OF HISTORICAL

03:36:30.577 --> 03:36:31.945
ROOTS WHICH WE MAY NOT KNOW IN

03:36:32.012 --> 03:36:37.517
THE MISTS OF TIME -- BUT I'M

03:36:37.584 --> 03:36:39.753
JUST WONDERING BASICALLY HE

03:36:39.820 --> 03:36:41.588
WOULD WHO ARE PERPETUATING THAT

03:36:41.655 --> 03:36:43.590
WHATEVER THAT POLICY CHOICE WAS

03:36:43.657 --> 03:36:44.424
BACK THEN.

03:36:44.491 --> 03:36:45.892
YOU KNOW MAYBE -- AND SO

03:36:45.959 --> 03:36:46.960
THINKING LIKE IS THAT SOMETHING

03:36:47.027 --> 03:36:47.761
WE SHOULD BE FIXING IS MAYBE

03:36:47.828 --> 03:36:51.365
BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT EITHER

03:36:51.431 --> 03:36:52.999
OF OUR WORK.

03:36:53.066 --> 03:36:53.600
FOLLOW ARE INCORRECT NOW RIGHT

03:36:53.667 --> 03:36:54.901
SO FOR EXAMPLE NOW THE SITUATION

03:36:54.968 --> 03:36:56.770
IS IS THAT -- AND I APPRECIATE

03:36:56.837 --> 03:36:59.072
THE GOVERNOR'S EMPHASIS ON YOU

03:36:59.139 --> 03:37:00.006
KNOW TREAT ON CHILDREN OF

03:37:00.073 --> 03:37:03.477
PEDIATRICIAN A FATHER -- AND THE

03:37:03.543 --> 03:37:04.878
A. S. IT STATES THAT YOU KNOW

03:37:04.945 --> 03:37:05.846
WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:37:05.912 --> 03:37:08.749
HOUSEHOLDS THAT DEPARTED REASON

03:37:08.815 --> 03:37:10.183
THE TEN A. L. MYSTERY OF UNIT

03:37:10.250 --> 03:37:11.618
ONE IS BECAUSE THERE MAY BE

03:37:11.685 --> 03:37:15.155
OTHER PEOPLE IN HOUSEHOLD.

03:37:15.222 --> 03:37:17.524
TWO DISCS FIRE SIDE METED OUT

03:37:17.591 --> 03:37:19.159
BITS THAT MAY NOT BE WHAT PEOPLE

03:37:19.226 --> 03:37:24.097
CONCEIVE THAT MY ASSUME THE

03:37:24.164 --> 03:37:26.600
HOUSEHOLD IS CORRECT.

03:37:26.666 --> 03:37:27.367
IS THAT IT GETS THE POINT YOU'RE

03:37:27.434 --> 03:37:27.601
MAKING.

03:37:27.667 --> 03:37:29.503
YEAH.

03:37:29.569 --> 03:37:30.370
COMMENTS FROM LA ABOUT THAT.

03:37:30.437 --> 03:37:31.271
I MEAN TO JUST.

03:37:31.338 --> 03:37:33.573
BRIEFLY WE'RE NOT AWARE OF

03:37:33.640 --> 03:37:33.974
HISTORICAL.

03:37:34.040 --> 03:37:35.809
SORT OF REASON FOR THIS THE

03:37:35.876 --> 03:37:37.411
DISTRIBUTION OF OF GRANTS ACROSS

03:37:37.477 --> 03:37:39.913
THE A USE NOW AN SIMILARLY.

03:37:39.980 --> 03:37:40.981
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS IN

03:37:41.047 --> 03:37:41.882
A PERFECT MEASURE.

03:37:41.948 --> 03:37:44.951
DIFFERENCES AMONG FAMILY SIZES --

03:37:45.018 --> 03:37:46.887
IT MIGHT BE MORE STANDARD -- I'M

03:37:46.953 --> 03:37:49.589
SPECULATING BUT WE'RE NOT AWARE

03:37:49.656 --> 03:37:51.358
OF THAT SORT OF EXISTING.

03:37:51.425 --> 03:37:54.861
STORY SO TO SPEAK OF OF WHY THE

03:37:54.928 --> 03:37:55.495
GRANTS ARE ARE THE WAY THEY ARE

03:37:55.562 --> 03:37:57.664
TODAY.

03:37:57.731 --> 03:37:58.999
WELL THIS IS THE SITE OF HER

03:37:59.065 --> 03:38:00.867
WELL UNDERLYING WHATEVER WE'RE

03:38:00.934 --> 03:38:02.702
DOING RIGHT AND THIS IS THE

03:38:02.769 --> 03:38:04.438
UNDERLYING IT THERE IS.

03:38:04.504 --> 03:38:06.606
WHETHER EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY.

03:38:06.673 --> 03:38:08.475
SOME DECISION WAS MADE WAY BACK

03:38:08.542 --> 03:38:10.410
WHEN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT OF

03:38:10.477 --> 03:38:12.012
ONLY WIND SHOULD GET A LOT LESS

03:38:12.078 --> 03:38:14.014
RELATIVE TO TWO OR MORE.

03:38:14.080 --> 03:38:16.683
RIGHT.

03:38:16.750 --> 03:38:20.020
AND FOR WHATEVER REASONS AND SO.

03:38:20.086 --> 03:38:22.722
I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS

03:38:22.789 --> 03:38:24.524
NOW IS IS THAT FOR WHATEVER AND

03:38:24.591 --> 03:38:25.859
AGAIN APPRECIATE GOVERNOR

03:38:25.926 --> 03:38:27.894
PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THIS.

03:38:27.961 --> 03:38:30.497
IS THAT DO WE WE CAN SIMPLY SAY

03:38:30.564 --> 03:38:31.398
WE GIVE MORE MONEY WEEK

03:38:31.465 --> 03:38:34.067
PERPETUATE THAT DIFFERENCE ABOUT

03:38:34.134 --> 03:38:35.402
BC THEY'RE GOING TO BENEFIT TO

03:38:35.469 --> 03:38:37.103
OR DO WE SAY THAT.

03:38:37.170 --> 03:38:38.038
KNOW WHAT WE LOOK BACK POLICY

03:38:38.104 --> 03:38:39.139
WAS WHATEVER REASON THAT

03:38:39.206 --> 03:38:41.208
HAPPENED BEFORE MAYBE THAT'S NOT

03:38:41.274 --> 03:38:42.142
SUCH A GOOD THING WE SHOULD

03:38:42.209 --> 03:38:43.310
CONTINUE NOW YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY

03:38:43.376 --> 03:38:44.878
ALSO UNDERSTAND ON THE DESIRE TO

03:38:44.945 --> 03:38:46.980
GET MORE RESOURCES TO YOUR

03:38:47.047 --> 03:38:48.648
FAMILY ON THE OTHER

03:38:48.715 --> 03:38:50.784
ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS.

03:38:50.851 --> 03:38:53.487
SO I AM NOT A CHANCE THAT BUT

03:38:53.553 --> 03:38:54.654
THAT THE I GUESS I'M TRYING TO

03:38:54.721 --> 03:38:55.455
DIG BACK INTO LIKE DOES IT MAKE

03:38:55.522 --> 03:38:56.790
SENSE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

03:38:56.857 --> 03:38:59.159
ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT SIZE ONE BE

03:38:59.226 --> 03:39:03.330
SO DESPERATE FROM.

03:39:03.396 --> 03:39:06.032
THE OTHER ONES.

03:39:06.099 --> 03:39:08.034
RIGHT I THINK THAT THAT BECAUSE

03:39:08.101 --> 03:39:09.035
WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT POLICY NONE

03:39:09.102 --> 03:39:10.504
OF US WERE HERE PROBABLY WANT TO

03:39:10.570 --> 03:39:12.806
HAPPEN DOWN ON TO THE VOTE WAS

03:39:12.873 --> 03:39:13.540
PRIDE VERY YOUNG BUT I HAD NO

03:39:13.607 --> 03:39:14.441
IDEA I WAS A PART OF IT BUT I'M

03:39:14.508 --> 03:39:14.641
JUST.

03:39:14.708 --> 03:39:16.109
I'M JUST RAISING THAT ISSUE

03:39:16.176 --> 03:39:17.043
BECAUSE I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL

03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.978
TO STEP BACK AND SAY WHAT IS OR

03:39:18.044 --> 03:39:19.145
WHAT DO WE WANT TO POLICY

03:39:19.212 --> 03:39:21.481
CALPERS TO BE.

03:39:21.548 --> 03:39:23.617
REGARDS TO THAT.

03:39:23.683 --> 03:39:24.518
SO HOPEFULLY THAT CAN BE A

03:39:24.584 --> 03:39:26.086
LITTLE BIT BUT THE DISCUSSION IS

03:39:26.152 --> 03:39:27.087
WORTH THINKING TOWARD MEET MAY

03:39:27.153 --> 03:39:30.690
REVISE -- THAT -- AND EVEN EVEN

03:39:30.757 --> 03:39:32.526
BEYOND IF WE DON'T DECIDE TO FIX

03:39:32.592 --> 03:39:35.795
IT RIGHT AWAY -- BUT I I THINK

03:39:35.862 --> 03:39:36.363
IT'S CERTAINLY IN THE

03:39:36.429 --> 03:39:37.664
LEGISLATURE WE FIRST THOUGHT

03:39:37.731 --> 03:39:40.233
ABOUT OUR PLAN I THINK THAT WAS

03:39:40.300 --> 03:39:41.201
PART.

03:39:41.268 --> 03:39:42.469
DISCUSSION WAS KIND OF LIKE WELL

03:39:42.536 --> 03:39:44.471
WE DON'T SEE WHY THAT THEY

03:39:44.538 --> 03:39:46.439
SHOULD BE SO DESPERATE AND MAYBE

03:39:46.506 --> 03:39:47.741
SHOULD TYPING EVERY THING ALL

03:39:47.807 --> 03:39:48.742
THE VOTES UP TO THE SAME LEVEL.

03:39:48.808 --> 03:39:50.944
CELL.

03:39:51.011 --> 03:39:52.012
BUT IF THERE'S A GOOD POLICY

03:39:52.078 --> 03:39:53.113
RATIONALLY KEEP THAT DIFFERENCE

03:39:53.179 --> 03:39:54.648
I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO HEARING IT

03:39:54.714 --> 03:39:56.316
BUT I'M NOT HEARING IT YET SELF

03:39:56.383 --> 03:39:57.484
OKAY.

03:39:57.551 --> 03:40:00.754
ANYTHING ELSE IN.

03:40:00.820 --> 03:40:01.054
ALL RIGHT.

03:40:01.121 --> 03:40:02.556
BUT I THINK IN THANK YOU SO MUCH

03:48:06.806 --> 03:48:08.074
AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THEN

03:48:08.141 --> 03:48:10.410
50% OF OF THE REST OF YOUR

03:48:10.476 --> 03:48:11.210
INCOME.

03:48:11.277 --> 03:48:12.779
AT THAT -- DISREGARD BEEN

03:48:12.845 --> 03:48:14.280
UPDATED FOR INFLATION AND THE

03:48:14.347 --> 03:48:15.548
MINIMUM WAGE IT WOULD CURRENTLY

03:48:15.615 --> 03:48:19.852
BE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND 50%

03:48:19.919 --> 03:48:21.220
TO ALMOST DOUBLE.

03:48:21.287 --> 03:48:23.089
AS A RESULT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS

03:48:23.156 --> 03:48:24.057
MORE OF A CLIFF THAN A BRIDGE --

03:48:24.123 --> 03:48:25.324
AND IT'S JEOPARDIZING THE

03:48:25.391 --> 03:48:26.926
SUCCESS OF HELPING -- MOVE

03:48:26.993 --> 03:48:28.327
PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK AND

03:48:28.394 --> 03:48:29.762
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO

03:48:29.829 --> 03:48:31.464
THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY

03:48:31.531 --> 03:48:32.965
CENTER -- IN THERE EXCELLENT

03:48:33.032 --> 03:48:34.700
RECENT ANALYSIS A PERSON WHO WAS

03:48:34.767 --> 03:48:36.069
WORKING AT A FULL TIME MINIMUM

03:48:36.135 --> 03:48:38.838
WAGE JOB AND CAL WORK STARTED --

03:48:38.905 --> 03:48:40.807
WOULD STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR A

03:48:40.873 --> 03:48:43.042
MODEST GRANT AND THE OTHER

03:48:43.109 --> 03:48:44.343
SUPPORT FROM THE CAL WORKS

03:48:44.410 --> 03:48:44.911
PROGRAM.

03:48:44.977 --> 03:48:46.913
A PERSON TODAY EARNING MINIMUM

03:48:46.979 --> 03:48:49.315
WAGE IS OFF CAL WORKS -- WITHOUT

03:48:49.382 --> 03:48:50.283
A GRANT AND WITHOUT THOSE

03:48:50.349 --> 03:48:52.418
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES LIKE

03:48:52.485 --> 03:48:53.853
TRANSPORTATION.

03:48:53.920 --> 03:48:55.221
IT'S A TERRIBLE CATCH TWENTY TWO

03:48:55.288 --> 03:48:58.357
FOR CLIENTS.

03:48:58.424 --> 03:48:58.991
THEY ARE FACED WITH THE CHOICE

03:48:59.058 --> 03:48:59.959
OF ACCEPTING MORE WORK -- BUT

03:49:00.026 --> 03:49:01.327
PERHAPS BEING PUSHED OFF THE

03:49:01.394 --> 03:49:02.595
PROGRAM IN THE LOSING THE

03:49:02.662 --> 03:49:04.330
CRITICAL SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO

03:49:04.397 --> 03:49:06.065
MAINTAIN THEIR CONNECTION TO THE

03:49:06.132 --> 03:49:06.866
WORK FORCE.

03:49:06.933 --> 03:49:09.335
THAT SAME CLIENT IN -- AT THE

03:49:09.402 --> 03:49:11.370
BEGINNING OF CAL WORKS FACED A

03:49:11.437 --> 03:49:12.705
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY MARKET

03:49:12.772 --> 03:49:13.940
THAT WAS THREE TIMES LESS

03:49:14.006 --> 03:49:15.541
EXPENSIVE.

03:49:15.608 --> 03:49:17.477
RENTS HAVE HAVE RAISED THREE

03:49:17.543 --> 03:49:19.045
TIMES THE RATE OF WAGES AND

03:49:19.112 --> 03:49:21.047
INFLATION AND SO THAT CLIENT

03:49:21.114 --> 03:49:22.882
TODAY WHO IS NOW OFF A ALSO

03:49:22.949 --> 03:49:24.317
FACES AN UNPRECEDENTEDLY

03:49:24.383 --> 03:49:25.952
UNPRECEDENTED EXPENSIVE HOUSING

03:49:26.018 --> 03:49:28.020
MARKET. TO OUR PROPOSAL IS TO

03:49:28.087 --> 03:49:29.455
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS

03:49:29.522 --> 03:49:34.961
REYES THAT THE DISREGARD -- TO

03:49:35.027 --> 03:49:36.929
ACCOUNT -- FOR THAT MINIMUM WAGE

03:49:36.996 --> 03:49:38.865
AND AND CURRENT AND SCHEDULED TO

03:49:38.931 --> 03:49:40.566
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND

03:49:40.633 --> 03:49:41.601
INFLATION.

03:49:41.667 --> 03:49:44.303
IT WOULD PHASE IN OVER TWO YEARS

03:49:44.370 --> 03:49:45.938
TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND 50%

03:49:46.005 --> 03:49:48.007
AND THERE AND THEN GOING FORWARD

03:49:48.074 --> 03:49:50.276
IT WOULD BE INDEXED -- FOR FOR

03:49:50.343 --> 03:49:52.778
INFLATION -- WERE NOT INCREASING

03:49:52.845 --> 03:49:54.113
THE GENEROSITY OF THE DISREGARD

03:49:54.180 --> 03:49:57.617
AS WE PROBABLY SHOULD -- BUT WE

03:49:57.683 --> 03:49:58.151
THINK THAT IT -- IT'S AN

03:49:58.217 --> 03:49:59.785
IMPORTANT -- POLICY THAT WOULD

03:49:59.852 --> 03:50:01.854
ALSO HELP US WITH THE FEDERAL W.

03:50:01.921 --> 03:50:04.724
P. R. BECAUSE THOSE CLIENTS WHO

03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:06.292
ARE KICKED OFF OF AID.

03:50:06.359 --> 03:50:08.094
PREMATURELY ARE ALSO KICKED OUT

03:50:08.161 --> 03:50:09.795
OF OUR DENOMINATOR -- IN OUR

03:50:09.862 --> 03:50:12.064
NUMERATOR AND SO IT WOULD HELP

03:50:12.131 --> 03:50:14.433
US MAINTAIN OUR FEDERAL

03:50:14.500 --> 03:50:15.468
COMPLIANCE AS WELL.

03:50:15.535 --> 03:50:17.603
OKAY THANK YOU.

03:50:22.341 --> 03:50:24.010
OVERDUE FOR AN UPDATE ESPECIALLY

INCENTIVIZE IS FAMILIES TO

03:50:31.150 --> 03:50:32.084
ENGAGE IN THE WORK FORCE WHILE

ADDITIONAL SKILLS.

03:50:34.387 --> 03:50:35.488
IN OVERCOMING.

03:50:35.555 --> 03:50:36.889
ADVERSITY THE DEPARTMENT

03:50:36.956 --> 03:50:39.358
ENCOURAGES THE CONSIDERATION --

03:50:39.425 --> 03:50:40.560
OF ALL THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS.

03:50:40.626 --> 03:50:41.694
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO

03:50:41.761 --> 03:50:42.461

AND EXAMINING THOSE FISCAL

03:50:45.464 --> 03:50:46.532
RESULTS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE

03:50:46.599 --> 03:50:47.567
LEGISLATORS PRIORITIES IN THE

03:50:47.633 --> 03:50:48.768
GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES.

03:50:48.834 --> 03:50:51.037
I THANK YOU AND I WILL RECOGNIZE

03:50:51.103 --> 03:50:53.372
THAT -- FINANCIAL POINT OUTSIDE

03:50:53.439 --> 03:50:54.574
FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND

03:50:54.640 --> 03:50:56.776
ALSO THE AGENCY LAST RECOGNIZE

03:50:56.842 --> 03:50:57.610
NOT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

03:50:57.677 --> 03:50:59.612
BUT BEYOND THAT I APPRECIATE THE

03:50:59.679 --> 03:51:02.882
TECHNICAL COMMENTS.

03:51:02.949 --> 03:51:04.450
THAT LEO.

03:51:04.517 --> 03:51:05.918
SIMILARLY -- WE'VE BEEN

03:51:05.985 --> 03:51:06.552
REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL AND ARE

03:51:06.619 --> 03:51:08.087
HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH

03:51:08.154 --> 03:51:08.821
YOUR STAFF AS THE SUBCOMMITTEE

03:51:08.888 --> 03:51:09.589
THINGS.

03:51:09.655 --> 03:51:11.958
THANK YOU FINANCE.

03:51:12.024 --> 03:51:14.060
CITY IRENE I KNOW IT IS A ALL

03:51:14.126 --> 03:51:15.561
RIGHT BUT IF YOU EVER HAVE ANY

03:51:15.628 --> 03:51:19.966
MORE YES CENTER STONE.

03:51:20.032 --> 03:51:21.400
I JUST WANT TO SAY IT -- IT MAY

03:51:21.467 --> 03:51:22.301
NOT BE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

03:51:22.368 --> 03:51:23.202
BUT I THINK YOU MAKE AVERY

03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:24.904
VALID ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY WE

03:51:24.971 --> 03:51:25.938
SHOULD BE ENTERTAINING THIS

03:51:26.005 --> 03:51:27.506
BECAUSE WE WANT TO JUST PUSH

03:51:27.573 --> 03:51:28.307
PEOPLE ARE.

03:51:28.374 --> 03:51:29.308
ARTIFICIALLY OVER THE CLIFF

03:51:29.375 --> 03:51:30.643
UNTIL THEY'RE READY TO BE SELF

03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:31.877
SUFFICIENT SO.

03:51:31.944 --> 03:51:33.379
YOU'RE IN CONTROL THE MINIMUM

03:51:33.446 --> 03:51:34.880
WAGE YOU DON'T CONTROL ACOSTA

03:51:34.947 --> 03:51:36.349
HOUSING AND SO

03:51:36.415 --> 03:51:37.516
I THINK IT'S A VERY --

03:51:37.583 --> 03:51:41.287
BENEFICIAL REQUEST THANK YOU FOR

03:51:41.354 --> 03:51:41.921
BEING HERE AND TELLING US ABOUT

03:51:41.988 --> 03:51:42.321
IT.

03:51:42.388 --> 03:51:44.890
AND I TO THINK.

03:51:44.957 --> 03:51:45.958
I MEAN CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT

03:51:46.025 --> 03:51:47.693
OF FUN GOOD POLICY RATIONALE FOR

03:51:47.760 --> 03:51:49.795
I GUESS IS HAS ANYONE LOOKED AT

03:51:49.862 --> 03:51:51.197
AND I KNOW TO BE HARD TO STUDY

03:51:51.264 --> 03:51:52.365
BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT

03:51:52.431 --> 03:51:53.766
SOMEONE'S APPROACHING IT THEN IS

03:51:53.833 --> 03:51:55.201
MAKING CERTAIN DECISIONS SO THEY

03:51:55.268 --> 03:51:56.836
MAY MAKE DIFFERENT DECISIONS IF

03:51:56.902 --> 03:51:58.938
THE INCOME DISREGARD.

03:51:59.005 --> 03:52:03.976
BUT ENOUGH TO TO ME.

03:52:04.043 --> 03:52:04.744
YEAH WE TALK ABOUT THE PLANNING

03:52:04.810 --> 03:52:05.344
PHASE LOAD BECAUSE ECONOMIES

03:52:05.411 --> 03:52:08.614
CONTINUE TO PROVE -- BUT ALSO TO

03:52:08.681 --> 03:52:11.817
WHAT DEGREE ARE WE ARE PEOPLE --

03:52:11.884 --> 03:52:14.520
THEM FOR GOING OUR OPPORTUNITIES

03:52:14.587 --> 03:52:16.389
TO EVENTUALLY GET OFF RIGHT

03:52:16.455 --> 03:52:16.956
BECAUSE THE FOOD BECAUSE THE

03:52:17.023 --> 03:52:18.324
ISSUE ISN'T THAT -- L. CAL WORKS

03:52:18.391 --> 03:52:19.759
I'M JUST NOW GETTING WELFARE AND

03:52:19.825 --> 03:52:21.360
GETTING YOU KNOW CHECKS FROM THE

03:52:21.427 --> 03:52:22.728
GOVERNMENT RIGHT IT'S ABOUT ALL

03:52:22.795 --> 03:52:24.163
SPORTS.

03:52:24.230 --> 03:52:25.765
AND SO THEY LOSE EVERYTHING

03:52:25.831 --> 03:52:27.800
RIGHT AND SO AND THEN THERE'S

03:52:27.867 --> 03:52:29.335
LESS LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL I

03:52:29.402 --> 03:52:30.403
MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE TRIED TO

03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:32.138
BUILD THIS THING AROUND THAT WAS

03:52:32.204 --> 03:52:36.442
KIND OF PART OF THE DEAL -- SO --

03:52:36.509 --> 03:52:37.543
YOU KNOW I AM JUST WONDERING

03:52:37.610 --> 03:52:39.612
LIKE IF WE HAD IF WE RAISE THIS

03:52:39.679 --> 03:52:40.780
REGARD BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS GOING

03:52:40.846 --> 03:52:42.648
COST X. NUMBER DOLLARS BECAUSE

03:52:42.715 --> 03:52:44.050
WE WOULD HAVE UP OF WHAT ELSE

03:52:44.116 --> 03:52:45.418
BUT IF WE DON'T DO IT.

03:52:45.484 --> 03:52:47.286
WHEN OVERFLOWED WE FOR GOING OUT

03:52:47.353 --> 03:52:48.754
OF THERE'S ANYBODY'S I'D DONE

03:52:48.821 --> 03:52:50.489
ANY SORT OF A LOOK I KNOW IT'S

03:52:50.556 --> 03:52:51.757
REALLY HARD THING TO FIGURE OUT?

03:52:51.824 --> 03:52:57.963
AS IT WENT IN ANY ASSESSMENT AS

03:52:58.030 --> 03:52:58.564
TO THERE WAS RESEARCH THAT WE

03:52:58.631 --> 03:52:59.165
BASED CALYX ON THAT SHOW THE

03:52:59.231 --> 03:52:59.765
POLICIES LIKE EARNED INCOME

03:52:59.832 --> 03:53:01.767
DISREGARDS ACTUALLY DID INCREASE

03:53:01.834 --> 03:53:02.435
WORK.

03:53:02.501 --> 03:53:03.836
AND INCREASE OUR CONNECTION TO

03:53:03.903 --> 03:53:04.937
THE WORK FORCE AND REDUCE YOUR

03:53:05.004 --> 03:53:06.405
LIKELIHOOD OF COMING BACK ON TO

03:53:06.472 --> 03:53:07.840
THE CAL ARTS PROGRAM.

03:53:07.907 --> 03:53:09.975
IT WAS BASED ON SOLID RESEARCH I

03:53:10.042 --> 03:53:11.077
DON'T THINK WE'VE.

03:53:11.143 --> 03:53:13.212
WE'VE LOOKED FROM A RESEARCH

03:53:13.279 --> 03:53:15.214
STANDPOINT ABOUT HOW HOW MUCH

03:53:15.281 --> 03:53:17.950
WE'VE LOST THOSE ADVANTAGES AS

03:53:18.017 --> 03:53:20.319
THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD --

03:53:20.386 --> 03:53:22.388
HAS ERODED BUT BASED ON THE

03:53:22.455 --> 03:53:23.789
SCIENCE THAT THE DID THAT THE

03:53:23.856 --> 03:53:25.024
DISREGARD IS BASED ON IN THE

03:53:25.091 --> 03:53:26.258
FIRST PLACE IT'S CLEARLY THE

03:53:26.325 --> 03:53:27.760
CASE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT

03:53:27.827 --> 03:53:29.261
ARE TURNING BACK ON TO THE ROLES.

03:53:29.328 --> 03:53:31.497
WHO WOULDN'T BE -- BECAUSE THAT

03:53:31.564 --> 03:53:33.065
THE INCENTIVE AND THE SUPPORT

03:53:33.132 --> 03:53:35.101
HAS HAS WANED -- AND AND MY

03:53:35.167 --> 03:53:37.169
CONCERN IS IS THAT NOW WE HAVE A

03:53:37.236 --> 03:53:38.571
CLOCK SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE

03:53:38.637 --> 03:53:39.939
MAIN APPEAL TURNED BACK BECAUSE

03:53:40.005 --> 03:53:41.941
THE CLOCK RAN OUT BUT NOW WE

03:53:42.007 --> 03:53:43.409
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FAMILIES TO

03:53:43.476 --> 03:53:44.443
BOTH CAN'T GET IT BECAUSE OF THE

03:53:44.510 --> 03:53:45.344
CLOCK.

03:53:45.411 --> 03:53:46.812
BUT WE ALSO SET THEM UP FOR

03:53:46.879 --> 03:53:49.949
FAILURE SO I MEAN I'M JUST

03:53:50.015 --> 03:53:52.485
WHINING ABOUT THE COST OF THAT.

03:53:52.551 --> 03:53:54.987
NOW I MEAN AS WE AS AS WE LOOK

03:53:55.054 --> 03:53:57.256
AT THE COST OF AT IN PARTNERSHIP

03:53:57.323 --> 03:53:58.724
WITH DSS.

03:53:58.791 --> 03:54:00.059
I THINK WE WE OUGHT TO LOOK FOR

03:54:00.126 --> 03:54:02.895
F. NOT STE YOU KNOW SCIENCE BUT

03:54:02.962 --> 03:54:04.663
AT LEAST SOME PROXY VARIABLES.

03:54:04.730 --> 03:54:07.333
TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELY REDUCE

03:54:07.400 --> 03:54:10.035
CHURN EFFECT OF MAKING THIS KIND

03:54:10.102 --> 03:54:10.803
OF INVESTMENT.

03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:13.038
OF ANY THEM THAT IT COVER IN

03:54:13.105 --> 03:54:13.639
ADDITION I'D LIKE TO NOTE IN

03:54:13.706 --> 03:54:15.007
WE'VE PROVIDED THIS TECHNICAL

03:54:15.074 --> 03:54:16.475
ASSISTANCE IS HE TO BE DAY WILL

03:54:16.542 --> 03:54:17.476
MAKE YOU AWARE OF IT AS WELL

03:54:17.543 --> 03:54:18.577
THAT THERE'S POTENTIAL COST

03:54:18.644 --> 03:54:19.945
pSAVINGS IN ADMINISTRATIVE

03:54:20.012 --> 03:54:21.447
SAVINGS WITH INCREASING THE

03:54:21.514 --> 03:54:23.416
INCOME REPORTING THRESHOLD ALONG

03:54:23.482 --> 03:54:25.451
SIDE THE E. ID -- AS A POTENTIAL

03:54:25.518 --> 03:54:26.852
COST SAVING AND STABILIZING

03:54:26.919 --> 03:54:29.688
MECHANISM ALONG SIDE.

03:54:29.755 --> 03:54:32.124
OKAY WELL LIKE THAT TO SELL ALL

03:54:32.191 --> 03:54:32.358
RIGHT.

03:54:32.425 --> 03:54:37.296
OKAY SO YEAH I I MEAN I THINK

03:54:37.363 --> 03:54:38.931
THAT.

03:54:38.998 --> 03:54:39.598
THE HOPEFULLY I REALIZE AS A BIG

03:54:39.665 --> 03:54:40.599
I MEAN WE'RE WORKING OUT THE

03:54:40.666 --> 03:54:41.233
NUMBER HAS A SOMEWHAT YOU KNOW

03:54:41.300 --> 03:54:42.835
THE THE THE THE PRICE TAG BUT

03:54:42.902 --> 03:54:44.770
ADDED MINIMUM AND I'M HOPING WE

03:54:44.837 --> 03:54:46.338
CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT

03:54:46.405 --> 03:54:47.940
MINIMUM AT LEAST TO A PILOT AND

03:54:48.007 --> 03:54:49.141
GET SOME MORE DATA.

03:54:49.208 --> 03:54:50.843
RIGHT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE

03:54:50.910 --> 03:54:51.977
REALLY.

03:54:52.044 --> 03:54:53.479
NO.

03:54:53.546 --> 03:54:55.014
I MEAN I'M.

03:54:55.080 --> 03:54:56.315
I THINK THAT'S NOT GONNA CLASSES

03:54:56.382 --> 03:54:57.850
MUCH AS WE THINK IT IS THAT'S

03:54:57.917 --> 03:54:59.218
WHY I WONDER.

03:54:59.285 --> 03:55:01.086
AND AND THAT THAT THAT THAT THIS

03:55:01.153 --> 03:55:02.388
IS ONE OF THE THAT'S THAT'S WHY

03:55:02.455 --> 03:55:03.889
THESE THINGS LIKE.

03:55:03.956 --> 03:55:05.691
IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW DO WE

03:55:05.758 --> 03:55:07.359
REALLY AND IT'S EASY TO SAY WELL

03:55:07.426 --> 03:55:07.927
IT'S GONNA COST EXT NUMBER

03:55:07.993 --> 03:55:09.462
BECAUSE NOW THE NOW THIS MAY

03:55:09.528 --> 03:55:11.030
PEOPLE THAT SET UP IT'S NOT A

03:55:11.096 --> 03:55:13.466
STREAMLINED CALCULATION RIGHT.

03:55:13.532 --> 03:55:14.733
AND SAID IF WE CAN DO

03:55:14.800 --> 03:55:15.534
ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES

03:55:15.601 --> 03:55:17.436
PEOPLE GALLON BEING ABLE TO COME

03:55:17.503 --> 03:55:19.038
OFF AND STAY OFF.

03:55:19.104 --> 03:55:20.940
AND BE IN THE WORKPLACE -- THAT

03:55:21.006 --> 03:55:22.942
IS HARDER TO CAPTURE THAT THAT

03:55:23.008 --> 03:55:25.377
COSTS SO I'D TELL I'M NOT A BAD

03:55:25.444 --> 03:55:26.912
WAY I'M NOT PROPOSING TO SAY

03:55:26.979 --> 03:55:28.380
THAT WE SHOULD DO PILE INSTEAD

03:55:28.447 --> 03:55:30.082
BUT IF WE FOR SOME REASON CAN'T

03:55:30.149 --> 03:55:31.083
GET TO BE CONVINCED PEOPLE AT

03:55:31.150 --> 03:55:32.718
LIKE WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND

03:55:32.785 --> 03:55:34.687
MUCH BIGGER BUDGET ITEMS.

03:55:34.753 --> 03:55:37.189
BASED ON HARD DATA THAT WE DON'T

03:55:37.256 --> 03:55:38.657
HAVE THAT REASONABLE PEOPLE MAKE

03:55:38.724 --> 03:55:40.593
REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON

03:55:40.659 --> 03:55:42.194
THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

03:55:42.261 --> 03:55:43.162
AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE ENOUGH

03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:44.263
INFORMATION TO MAKE SOME OF

03:55:44.330 --> 03:55:45.898
THOSE ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS

03:55:45.965 --> 03:55:50.002
PROPOSAL I BELIEVE.

03:55:50.069 --> 03:55:51.704
OKAY.

03:55:51.770 --> 03:55:52.471
ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT.

03:55:52.538 --> 03:55:53.105
THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE

03:55:53.172 --> 03:55:55.641
ON TO BEST NUMBER TO CAL WORKS

03:55:55.708 --> 03:55:57.142
TWO POINT OH AUTOMATION I THINK

03:55:57.209 --> 03:55:58.410
YOU'RE UP AGAINST DOCTOR PAN

03:55:58.477 --> 03:56:00.613
THIS IS A ONE TIME -- FUNDING

03:56:00.679 --> 03:56:02.314
REQUEST OF ABOUT FIVE MILLION

03:56:02.381 --> 03:56:04.884
DOLLARS. TO AUTOMATE TOOLS THAT

03:56:04.950 --> 03:56:06.352
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AS PART OF

03:56:06.418 --> 03:56:09.121
THAT CAL WORKS TO PLANO PROJECT.

03:56:09.188 --> 03:56:11.624
SO THE DSS FOLKS TOLD YOU ABOUT

03:56:11.690 --> 03:56:13.459
CAL OR IN AS A COMPANION TO CAL

03:56:13.526 --> 03:56:15.394
OR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS

03:56:15.461 --> 03:56:16.962
ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN PARTNERING.

03:56:17.029 --> 03:56:19.064
WITH MATHEMATICA POLICY RESEARCH

03:56:19.131 --> 03:56:21.133
AND OTHER -- AND UP AND ENGAGING

03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:23.736
ADVOCATES AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF.

03:56:23.802 --> 03:56:25.137
TO IMPROVE THE WAY WE DO CASE

03:56:25.204 --> 03:56:27.306
WORK TO TRY TO TO TRY TO GET AT

03:56:27.373 --> 03:56:29.141
THIS MORE HOLISTIC BROADER SAID

03:56:29.208 --> 03:56:31.877
ABOUT CALMS -- THE UTILIZING

03:56:31.944 --> 03:56:33.712
BRAIN SCIENCE BEHAVIORAL

03:56:33.779 --> 03:56:36.415
RESEARCH -- ON HOW ADULTS LEARN

03:56:36.482 --> 03:56:37.850
AND BUILD CRITICAL SKILLS.

03:56:37.917 --> 03:56:41.153
IT'S A CULTURE SHIFT AWAY FROM

03:56:41.220 --> 03:56:42.321
THE COMPLIANCE DRIVEN.

03:56:42.388 --> 03:56:43.756
CASE MANAGEMENT APPROACH IN

03:56:43.822 --> 03:56:46.392
TOWARD ONE THAT'S BASED ON

03:56:46.458 --> 03:56:48.260
RESPONSIVE REAL INTERACTIONS

03:56:48.327 --> 03:56:49.929
BETWEEN THE CASE MANAGER IN A

03:56:49.995 --> 03:56:52.398
CUSTOMER -- BASED ON IDENTIFYING

03:56:52.464 --> 03:56:54.867
PLANNING AND ACHIEVING GOALS

03:56:54.934 --> 03:56:56.302
THAT BUILD ONE UPON EACH OTHER

03:56:56.368 --> 03:56:57.703
IT'S IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

03:56:57.770 --> 03:56:59.004
WAY.

03:56:59.071 --> 03:57:00.940
OF DOING CASE WORK MATHEMATICA

03:57:01.006 --> 03:57:02.241
POLICY RESEARCH OUR PARTNERS

03:57:02.308 --> 03:57:03.876
DEVELOPED AN INCREDIBLE SUITE OF

03:57:03.943 --> 03:57:06.312
TOOLS TO HELP CASE WORKERS TO

03:57:06.378 --> 03:57:07.846
THEIR JOBS I SHOULD SAY MISS

03:57:07.913 --> 03:57:08.814
NIKOLAI WAS THE PRINCIPAL

03:57:08.881 --> 03:57:11.083
INVESTIGATOR WITH MATHEMATICA

03:57:11.150 --> 03:57:13.018
BEFORE SHE WAS STOLEN AWAY -- BY

03:57:13.085 --> 03:57:15.888
DSS -- A WIN WIN FOR ALL OF US I

03:57:15.955 --> 03:57:18.524
BELIEVE -- BUT THOSE THE SUITE

03:57:18.591 --> 03:57:20.359
OF TOOLS THIS IS A VOLUNTARY

03:57:20.426 --> 03:57:21.827
PROJECT THAT THE COUNTIES OF

ORDER TO INCREASE THE TAKE UP WE

03:57:25.664 --> 03:57:27.366
HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER I THINK

03:57:27.433 --> 03:57:29.001
FOR WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE

03:57:29.068 --> 03:57:29.835
TOOLS.

03:57:29.902 --> 03:57:31.303
AND IDEALLY WE WOULD EMBED THOSE

03:57:31.370 --> 03:57:33.172
TOOLS INTO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM

03:57:33.238 --> 03:57:34.573
THAT THEY'RE ALREADY USING SO

03:57:34.640 --> 03:57:36.108
THAT THAT DATA AND THE TOOLS CAN

03:57:36.175 --> 03:57:38.210
BE HELPFUL MOST HELPFUL FOR CASE

03:57:38.277 --> 03:57:38.644
MANAGEMENT.

FUNDING WILL ONLY GO FAR ENOUGH

03:59:42.301 --> 03:59:44.670
TO REACH AN ESTIMATED 80% OF THE

ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:59:55.481 --> 03:59:57.549
AND THIS IS -- VERY SMART POLICY

03:59:57.616 --> 03:59:59.518
BUT KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS

03:59:59.585 --> 04:00:01.120
APPROACH WILL BE DATA.

04:00:01.186 --> 04:00:04.623
AND ALSO -- INSURING THAT -- THE

ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS UNTIL

04:00:14.133 --> 04:00:15.634
LAST YEAR THIS ODD NETWORK WAS

MAXIMIZE SCARCE RESOURCES?

04:00:58.844 --> 04:01:00.145

04:04:28.053 --> 04:04:29.121
THE TIME ON AID.

04:04:29.187 --> 04:04:31.056
FROM THE FEDERAL MAXIMUM OF

04:04:31.123 --> 04:04:32.457
SIXTY MONTHS PUTTING US IN A

04:04:32.524 --> 04:04:34.092
MINORITY OF STATES IN THE UNITED

04:04:34.159 --> 04:04:36.395
STATES INCLUDING -- SEVERAL --

04:04:36.461 --> 04:04:37.729
SOUTHERN STATES THAT CONTINUED

04:04:37.796 --> 04:04:39.998
AB SIXTY MONTH CLOCKS OUR STATE

04:04:40.065 --> 04:04:41.133

YEAR THE LEGISLATURE.

04:04:44.302 --> 04:04:46.838
AGAIN UNDER THE DRESS OF A VERY

04:04:46.905 --> 04:04:49.174
DIFFICULT BUDGET SITUATION -- WE

04:04:49.241 --> 04:04:51.610
MADE CHANGES TO WE SPLIT THOSE

04:04:51.676 --> 04:04:53.578
FORTY EIGHT MONTHS IN HALF

04:04:53.645 --> 04:04:54.112
TWENTY FOUR FOR FLEXIBLE A

04:04:54.179 --> 04:04:55.981
FLEXIBLE CLOCK TWENTY FOUR

04:04:56.048 --> 04:04:57.916
MONTHS FOR THE MORE DIFFICULT

04:04:57.983 --> 04:05:00.752
CAN OFF TO A WORK REQUIREMENTS.

04:05:00.819 --> 04:05:02.821
I I THINK -- IN NOT JUST

04:05:02.888 --> 04:05:04.389
OURSELVES BUT I THINK THE RAND

04:05:04.456 --> 04:05:06.792
CORPORATION HAS -- CONFIRM THAT

04:05:06.858 --> 04:05:08.160
THOSE CHANGES EXPRESSLY

04:05:08.226 --> 04:05:09.995
SPLITTING THE CLOCK AND HAVE --

04:05:10.062 --> 04:05:12.864
HAD VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON THE

04:05:12.931 --> 04:05:14.866
ABILITY OF FAMILIES TO GET OUT

04:05:14.933 --> 04:05:17.536
OF POVERTY -- NOW HAVING SAID

04:05:17.602 --> 04:05:18.937
THAT I MEAN WE DO THINK THAT

04:05:19.004 --> 04:05:21.273
THERE IS A BENEFIT TO PRESERVING

04:05:21.339 --> 04:05:23.408
THE FLEXIBLE APPROACH WE THINK

04:05:23.475 --> 04:05:24.943
ABOUT APPROACH ACTUALLY MAKES

04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:26.511
SENSE IN LIGHT OF THE

04:05:26.578 --> 04:05:28.246
CONVERSATION THAT YOU JUST HAD.

04:05:28.313 --> 04:05:30.916
AROUND -- TOWN AFTER HOURS TWO

04:05:30.982 --> 04:05:32.884
POINT NO FEE THE NEW APPROACH

04:05:32.951 --> 04:05:34.386
THAT WERE USING THAT'S THE TO

04:05:34.453 --> 04:05:36.188
GENERATION APPROACH MOVING AWAY

04:05:36.254 --> 04:05:37.789
FROM THE OLD COMPLIANCE MODEL.

04:05:37.856 --> 04:05:39.491
SO THAT FLEXIBLE APPROACH WE

04:05:39.558 --> 04:05:41.693
BELIEVE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND

04:05:41.760 --> 04:05:43.528
SO IN GOING BACK TO THE SIXTY

04:05:43.595 --> 04:05:45.430
MONTH CLOCK WE WOULD ENCOURAGE

04:05:45.497 --> 04:05:47.566
THE STATE TO EXTEND OUT THAT

04:05:47.632 --> 04:05:49.601
FLEXIBLE PARTS OF THE ENTIRE

04:05:49.668 --> 04:05:51.970
SIXTY MONTHS. TO ALLOW TEN OF

04:05:52.037 --> 04:05:52.838
TWO POINT NO CALORIES TWO POINT

04:05:52.904 --> 04:05:55.407
NO TO BE ABLE TO APPLY ITSELF AS

04:05:55.474 --> 04:06:00.812
NEEDED -- THE OTHER THING THAT

04:06:00.879 --> 04:06:02.180
WE WOULD SAY ABOUT THE NEED FOR

04:06:02.247 --> 04:06:03.515
THE SIXTY MONTH CLOCK IS -- OUR

04:06:03.582 --> 04:06:05.317
FAMILIES ARE NOT ALL THE SAME

04:06:05.383 --> 04:06:08.286
AND THEY THEY THEY THEY SUCCEED

04:06:08.353 --> 04:06:10.589
IN THE PROGRAM AT DIFFERENT

04:06:10.655 --> 04:06:12.124
LEVELS AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS.

04:06:12.190 --> 04:06:13.592
M. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO

04:06:13.658 --> 04:06:15.494
KNOW WE HAVE A CASE LOAD NOW IS

04:06:15.560 --> 04:06:16.962
IT'S GOTTEN SMALLER AND SMALLER.

04:06:17.028 --> 04:06:18.763
THAT IS MORE COMPRISED OF

04:06:18.830 --> 04:06:21.333
FAMILIES WHO HAVE MORE BARRIERS

04:06:21.399 --> 04:06:22.901
TO OVERCOME I THINK WHEN YOU

04:06:22.968 --> 04:06:25.036
HEAR RECIPIENTS COME OFF AND ONE

04:06:25.103 --> 04:06:25.904
OF THE THINGS YOU'LL OFTEN HEAR

04:06:25.971 --> 04:06:27.472
THEM SAY AS THEY WERE LEAVING A

04:06:27.539 --> 04:06:29.007
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION.

04:06:29.074 --> 04:06:30.509
AT THE POINT THAT THEY ENTERED

04:06:30.575 --> 04:06:32.077
INTO THE CASELOAD -- PEOPLE

04:06:32.144 --> 04:06:34.479
OFTEN NEED MANY MONTHS TO TRY TO

04:06:34.546 --> 04:06:35.247
GET THROUGH A SITUATION LIKE

04:06:35.313 --> 04:06:37.149
THAT OUR CURRENT RULES STILL

04:08:25.724 --> 04:08:27.659
DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT CALOR AND

04:08:27.726 --> 04:08:30.395
CAL WORKS TWO POINT NO AND THE

04:08:30.462 --> 04:08:32.030
SINGLE ALLOCATION AND I MADE AN

04:08:32.097 --> 04:08:33.598
OR A PLEA EARLIER.

04:08:33.665 --> 04:08:35.867

04:08:35.934 --> 04:08:37.068
ALLOCATION.

04:08:37.135 --> 04:08:38.336
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN THIS

04:08:38.403 --> 04:08:41.006
ARENA IS ARE TWO THINGS I THINK

04:08:41.072 --> 04:08:41.906
ONE IS?

04:08:41.973 --> 04:08:43.842
AS THE COUNTIES BEGIN TO

04:08:43.908 --> 04:08:45.543
IMPLEMENT THE NEW TWO POINT OH

04:08:45.610 --> 04:08:48.713
APPROACH -- WE FEEL THERE'S A

04:08:48.780 --> 04:08:50.415
CONFLICT WITH THE EXISTING

04:08:50.482 --> 04:08:52.183
STATUTORY STRUCTURE WHICH

04:08:52.250 --> 04:08:54.653
CONTINUES TO PUSH TOWARDS --

04:08:54.719 --> 04:08:55.920
WHAT WAS EARLIER DESCRIBED IN

04:08:55.987 --> 04:08:57.989
OUR TESTIMONY DAYS THE OLD WORK

04:08:58.056 --> 04:09:00.125
FIRST APPROACH A SO THE COUNTY

04:09:00.191 --> 04:09:01.926
AND THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE

04:09:01.993 --> 04:09:03.461
ARE STILL OUT THERE?

04:09:03.528 --> 04:09:05.030
THAT THE COUNTY IS STILL

04:09:05.096 --> 04:09:06.965
REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE STATUTE --

04:09:07.032 --> 04:09:08.633
THE COUNTY IN SOME DEGREE IS

04:09:08.700 --> 04:09:10.735
STILL BEING PUSHED -- TO TRY TO

04:09:10.802 --> 04:09:12.437
ME WORK PARTICIPATION RATES EVEN

04:09:12.504 --> 04:09:14.506
THOUGH WE KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT

04:09:14.572 --> 04:09:17.275
REALLY A GOOD MEASURE WHAT WE

04:09:17.342 --> 04:09:18.143
WERE DOING AND IT.

04:09:18.209 --> 04:09:19.778

WE'RE DOING IN CALOR.

04:09:21.212 --> 04:09:22.781
SO OUR RECOMMENDATION ON THIS I

04:09:22.847 --> 04:09:25.517
REQUEST OF THE COMMITTEE IS THAT --

04:09:25.583 --> 04:09:27.585

04:21:07.018 --> 04:21:08.486
CERTAIN POINTS IF YOUR ASSETS

04:21:08.552 --> 04:21:10.488

04:26:27.938 --> 04:26:29.773

HAPPENING OF IN LA AT IN IN --

04:28:37.868 --> 04:28:39.803
AT A FASTER RATE AND THE REASON

04:28:39.870 --> 04:28:40.904
FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THE LOS

04:28:40.971 --> 04:28:42.506

04:28:42.573 --> 04:28:46.043

WE BEGAN OUR LAST YEAR AS OF

04:28:50.414 --> 04:28:53.050
LAST YEAR -- JULY AT OUR MINIMUM

AT SOME OF THE DATA AND WE'RE

04:29:06.597 --> 04:29:10.200
