GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER AND

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.546
IF WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.548
TEACHERS. AND OUR- FACULTY IN

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:11.616
UNIVERSITIES STUDENTS SHOULD BE

00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:13.485
PROTECTED AS WELL THERE SEEMS TO

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:15.787
BE A DISPARITY HERE AND WHAT THE

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:16.721

TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. THIS IS

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:33.939
NOT A COMPLETE PACKAGE SO

00:24:34.005 --> 00:24:35.040
BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS THOUGH

00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:36.908

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.677

HISTORICALLY CORRECT ME IF I'M

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:02.467
WRONG IS SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:03.602

WITH SOMETHING ELSE. AND YOU'RE

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:29.160
