THAT ARE ALREADY AT THE

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:53.459
FOREFRONT OF OUR ATTENTION AND

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.060
MANY OF THESE EFFORTS ARE WELL

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.929
UNDERWAY. FOR EXAMPLE SOLUTIONS

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.431
TO ENCOURAGE MODE SHIFT AND

00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:00.366
HELP REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCY ON

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.634
SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:04.737

CENTERED AROUND THIS CALIFORNIA

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:10.176
STATE REAL PLAN. INCREASING

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:11.644
TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS ABSOLUTELY

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:14.013
FUNDAMENTAL TO VMT REDUCTION AS

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.816
I MENTIONED EARLIER. AND THE

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:17.917
WAY TO BOLSTER RIDERSHIP IS TO

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.251
INCREASE THE SAFETY

FREQUENCY OF TRANSIT SERVICE.

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:26.525
IN ORDER ON THAT POINT I WANT

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.027
TO HIGHLIGHT THE CALIFORNIA

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:31.630
INTEGRATED TROUBLE PROJECT OR

TROUBLE SIMPLER AND COST

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:44.210
EFFECTIVE BY ENHANCING THE

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:46.245
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. ONE

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.113
SEAMLESS PAYMENT PLAN FOR THE

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.915
ENTIRE STATE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.083
STRATEGY TO ENCOURAGE MODE

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.985
SHIFT AND REDUCE VMT IS

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:54.320
EXPANDING BICYCLE AND

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.055

TRANSPORTATION IS A CRITICAL

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.262
FIRST AND LAST MILE SOLUTION TO

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.097
ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE AROUND

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:08.167
WITHOUT A VEHICLE. ALSO WE WANT

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:09.168

INFILL HOUSING YOUR JOBS. THE

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:14.907
IDEA IS TO ADVANCE PROJECTS

THAT HELP PROMOTE THE RIGHT

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:17.910
KIND OF DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.445
INCREASING HOUSING YOUR KEY

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.479
EMPLOYMENT CENTERS WILL HELP

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:21.781
REDUCE THE DISTANCE PEOPLE NEED

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.984
TO DRIVE. ADDITIONALLY WHEN

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.019
TACKLING CONGESTION. WE NEED TO

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:28.621
PRIORITIZE DEMAND MANAGEMENT

00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.756
STRATEGIES RATHER THAN HI WE

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:32.391
CAPACITY EXPANSION WHERE

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.560
FEASIBLE. THIS INCLUDES

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:35.594
STRATEGIES LIKE EQUITABLE

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:37.530
APPLICATIONS OF ROADWAY PRICING

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:39.231
WHETHER IT BE MANAGED LANES ARE

MORE INNOVATIVE PRICING

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:41.734
STRATEGIES SUCH AS COURTING

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:43.302
PRICING WHICH IS BEING PURSUED

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.438
IN WEST LA BY LA METRO AND

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:47.973
SCATTERED. FURTHERMORE WE NEED

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.641
TO ENSURE THAT OUR

00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:50.109
INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITATES THE

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:52.011
ADOPTION OF CLEAN VEHICLES AND

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:54.246
WE CAN DO THIS BY SUPPORTING

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:55.014

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.533
IMPORTANT. THESE PRINCIPLES

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.702
WILL DRIVER DECISION MAKING ON

WE FOCUS ON MOBILE SO. ARE RISK

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:10.109
FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF

INCREASINGLY WE'VE CLEANED UP

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.982
ENGINES AND WE'VE CLEANED UP

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:18.617
FUELS AND WE'VE GOT INCENTIVES

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:20.853
IN PLACE TO TURN OVER THE

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:23.222
VEHICLE FLEET. ALL OF WHICH

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.957
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE

THESE VERY TINY NUMBERS HERE ON

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:32.798
THIS SLIDE- BUT AT THE KEY THE

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.167
KEY THING IS- OBVIOUSLY THAT WE

UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THE

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:43.642
PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:45.311

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:55.988
WE GET THE- BURNING OF DOLE'S

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:57.956
FASSEL FEELS IN TURN. LEADS TO

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:05.698
THE KNOX. SO JUST THIS AHEAD

AREA- AND ALL WE HAVE ORDERS IN

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:17.903
PLACE NOW THAT WOULD GET US TO

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.339
A 100% NEW CAR SALES IS BEING

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:21.640
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.810
INCLUDING SCHOOL BUSES MARINE

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:33.652
AIRPORT- THE END THERE MENDES

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:37.589
OUT OF ACT. GOING ON IN AREA

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:39.925
BUT WE NEED TO ACT ACCORDING TO

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:42.961
CARBS ANALYSIS HAVE ALL

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:44.797
PASSENGER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:46.899
BE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:49.268
THAT COULD INCLUDE FUEL CELLS

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.303
NOT JUST BATTERY ELECTRIC BUT

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.206
SOMEHOW ZERO EMISSION. TWENTY

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:55.974
FORTY FIVE WHERE OBVIOUSLY VERY

00:17:56.041 --> 00:18:00.813
LONG WAY FROM THAT OR RIGHT NOW

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:02.414
WE NEED TO BE REDUCING THE

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.916
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED PER

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:06.919
CAPITA AND- WE NEED TO HAVE

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:09.955
OPTION AT SEC. KIM POINTED OUT

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.524
EARLIER TO MAKE IT DOWN IN THE

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.827
CURRENT SO WELL THERE'S A OF

00:18:14.893 --> 00:18:16.895
TALK NOW AT THE MOMENT ABOUT

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:18.096
YOU KNOW WHETHER WE NEED

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:21.366
EVOLUTION VERSUS INCREMENTAL

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:22.935
CHANGE AND THAT'S POLITICAL

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:26.104
DIALOGUE WERE IN. I THINK IT'S

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:28.307
FAIR TO SAY THAT WE ARE LOW

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:31.510
THING IN. THAT'S SOMETHING WE

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:34.213
ANNOUNCED TO EVOLUTION HOPE IT

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:37.349
HAPPENS IN A PAIN WAY IS DONE

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:43.188
IN A WAY WHERE JAMBOREE. REACH

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:47.192
READ THE CAN IS TO OFTEN THE

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:48.861
BLOW FOR THOSE FOR WHOM WOULD

00:18:48.927 --> 00:19:01.373
BE A BIRD. BUT. SECRETARY KIM

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.041
TALKED ABOUT THE DO SCOPING

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:05.177
PLAN THAN A RB IS WORKING ON

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.445
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:08.347
GRAPPLE WITH THESE ISSUES AND

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:10.749
BEING. A STATE THAT HAS A VERY

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:14.820
ROBUST- CONSTITUENCY AROUND ALL

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:16.955
TRANSPORTATION ISSUES IT MEANS

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:18.156
THAT WE CAN'T DO THIS BY

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:20.425
OURSELVES- OFF IN A IN A ROOM

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:21.660
SOMEWHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:23.929
TO. ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.098
STAKEHOLDERS AT BOTH URBAN AND

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:28.333
RURAL AND LARGE CITIES AND

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.636
SMALL AND TRY TO COME UP WITH

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:32.504
SOMETHING THAT WILL ACTUALLY.

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.840
MAKE PROGRESS WE ARE OPTIMISTIC

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:37.075
THAT WE CAN DO THIS- BECAUSE

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:38.577
WE'VE SEEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:42.080
TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE PAST- BUT-

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:44.049
WE DO FACE SOME OBSTACLES ONE

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:44.683
OF WHICH OF COURSE IS THE

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.818
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CURRENT

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:48.120
EFFORTS TO TAKE AWAY OUR

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:51.490
AUTHORITY- AS A STATE TO- TO

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:54.092
REQUIRE. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:59.698
AND TO TAKE A POSITION THAT THE

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:03.769
STATE HAS NO AUTHORITY TO DEAL

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:05.938
WITH. DILIGENTLY IN THE COURTS

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:07.773
AND WITH THE AGENCIES TO TRY TO

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:10.008
CHANGE THAT POSITION BUT THIS

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:12.878
IS STILL- STILL AN ONGOING.

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:16.915
STRUGGLE SO- I WANTED JUST-

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:18.984
FLIP AHEAD HERE A LITTLE BIT TO

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.453
TALK ABOUT LIGHT DUTY VERSUS

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.722
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES BECAUSE-

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:25.057
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ELECTRIC

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:27.459
VEHICLES MOST PEOPLE I THINK

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:31.630
PICTURE- YOU KNOW A LEAF FOR

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.732
TESLA MAYBE OR SOMETHING. THAT

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:36.568
IS AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION TO

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:38.704
PURCHASE AND WE ARE VERY

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.506
ENGAGED IN THAT- IN THAT

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:43.842
PROGRAM IN TERMS OF TRYING TO

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.210
EXPAND THE OPTIONS AND THE

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:47.245
CHOICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:50.148
TO MAKE OF VEHICLES AVAILABLE

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:51.216
AND ALL DIFFERENT

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:54.453
CONFIGURATIONS AND- AT PRICES

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:56.588
THAT PEOPLE CAN AFFORD HEY. WE

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.390
HAVE USED THE CLEAN VEHICLE

00:20:58.457 --> 00:21:01.994
REBATE PROJECT AS A WAY TO

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.795
PROVIDE REPEAT STEP. SERVERS AS

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:05.897
A BRINGING DOWN THE CALL. WE

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:09.067
HAVE ANOTHER. THAT SEEKS.

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:11.236
ADEQUATE CONSIDER. BY BRINGING

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:14.740
UP THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT AT-

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.742
A PERSON WHO HAS A CAR THAT

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:18.777
FAILS THE SMOG CHECK TEST CAN

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:20.379
GET TO PURCHASE A NEWER CLEANER

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.481
CAR. SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:24.216
ACTIVITY IN THAT SPACE AND IT'S

00:21:24.282 --> 00:21:25.217
MEANT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:29.121
BECOME THE- EPICENTER FOR

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:30.522
ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THE

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:32.824
COUNTRY WITH MORE- MORE

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:34.726
PASSENGER VEHICLES HERE THAN

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:36.962
ANY PLACE ELSE AND IN FACT MORE

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:38.430
THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:41.366
AB COMBINED BUT IT'S STLL ONLY

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:43.268
DEALS WITH ABOUT HALF THE

00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:46.204
PROBLEM IF YOU- FLIP THE HEAD

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:49.808
TO- THE TENTH PAGE OF THE

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:52.077
HANDOUT. YOU CAN SEE THE HEAVY

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:57.482
DUTY VEHICLES MAKE UP 20% OF

00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:58.417
TRANSPORTATION RELATED J. M.

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:00.519
AND OF LARGEST. OF KNOX

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:01.753
EMISSIONS WITHIN THE

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.090
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THAT 43%

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.359
SO IN ORDER TO MEET BOTH THE

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:08.994
AIR QUALITY STANDARDS AND

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:11.730
PARTICULARLY TO REDUCE THE

00:22:11.797 --> 00:22:13.432
BURDEN OF POLLUTION IN THE

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:17.502
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE CENTERED

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:18.270
AROUND FOR. RAIL YARDS

00:22:18.336 --> 00:22:20.939
TRANSPORTATION HUBS. CENTERS

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:23.542
LIKE THE WAREHOUSES- THAT WE

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:26.411
HAVE IN THE EASTERN AND THE LA

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:28.914
BASIN. WE HAVE TO TAKE A

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.782
BROADER APPROACH TO

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:32.484
ACCELERATING A LARGE SCALE

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:35.120
TRANSITION OF ZERO EMISSION

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:37.923
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:38.824
AND WE'RE DOING THIS THROUGH

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.625
THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADVANCED

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:43.328
CLEAN TRUCK REGULATION THIS IS

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:44.696
A WORK IN PROGRESS AT THE

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:46.765
MOMENT BUT IT'S INTENDED TO

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:48.333
ACCELERATE A LARGE SCALE

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.902
TRANSITION. OF ZERO EMISSION

00:22:50.969 --> 00:22:53.271
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:54.005
BOTH THROUGH A SALES

FLEET PURCHASERS IN PARTICULAR

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:04.883
AND WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.052
OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN BOLSTER

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:10.021
THIS. WHOLE AREA AS WELL

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:11.623
RECOGNIZING THIS COMPLICATED

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.458
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:15.327
THE ECONOMY THAT WE DO THIS

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:17.429
RIGHT BUT WITHOUT SENDING SOME

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:20.732
PRETTY- STOFF LONG TERM GOALS

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.901
AND COMING UP WITH METHODS TO

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:25.504
PUSH PEOPLE IN THAT DIRECTION I

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.605
DON'T THINK WE CAN JUST COUNT

00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:32.644
ON NATURAL ATTRITION TO GET US

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:33.278
TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO. ANYTIME

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:35.647
SOON SEC. WE'RE TRYING TO

00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:37.115
ANSWER PROJECTS IN THE HEAVY

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:39.618
DUTY AND FREIGHT SPACE AS WELL

00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:41.419
WE HAVE HAD PROGRAMS IN EFFECT

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:43.922
DOWN FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW TO

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:45.157
FUND THE PRE COMMERCIAL

00:23:45.223 --> 00:23:47.492
DEMONSTRATION PHASE PILOTS

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.628
EARLY COMMERCIALIZATION WHICH

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:50.495
CAN HELP WITH THE COMMERCIAL

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:52.764
DEPLOYMENT. AND MARKET SCALE

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:53.632

SUPPORT FOR COOPERATION AND

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.778
COLLABORATION FROM THE FEDERAL

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:08.580
GOVERNMENT WE ARE CONCERNED

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:09.815
THAT WE'RE GOING TO FACE

00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:13.852
OPPOSITION THERE AS WELL AND SO

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.787
WE ARE TRYING HARD WORKING OUT

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:18.089
WITH AGENCIES WITH THE INDUSTRY

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:20.559
WHICH WANTS TO SEE A NATIONAL

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:24.362
APPROACH HERE. FIVE TO GET OUT

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:26.198
OF PROGRAM WHICH WILL ACTUALLY

00:24:26.264 --> 00:24:28.333
BE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR US AND

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.101
FOR OTHER STATES THAT FACE SOME

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.504
SOME SIMILAR CONCERNS.

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:33.905
ATTAINING THE FEDERAL OZONE

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:37.108

BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. TO MEET

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.324
THE OZONE STANDARD AND THAT'S

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.693
AN EX BEEN EXTENDED OUT MANY

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:56.194
YEARS INTO THE FUTURE FROM

00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:57.596
WHERE IT WAS ORIGINALLY SET TO

00:24:57.662 --> 00:25:02.834
BE. AND 72% REDUCTION BY TWENTY

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.102

TWENTY THIRTY KNOCKS EMISSIONS

00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:11.142
FROM THE FEDERALLY REGULATED

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:13.712
SOURCES WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:15.881
THE ABILITY TO DIRECTLY CONTROL

00:25:15.947 --> 00:25:18.049
WHICH INCLUDE THE INTERSTATE

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:20.452
TRUCKS PLANES TRAINS AND SHIPS

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:22.287
WILL EXCEED THE EMISSIONS FROM

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.589
ALL OF THE SOURCES THAT CAR.

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:27.759
DOES ACTUALLY REGULATE SO OUR

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:29.628
THIRTY IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ON

00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:31.029
LIMITED HERE BUT WE ARE STILL

00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:33.231
TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:36.835
EMISSIONS FROM PHRASE WORKING

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:42.440
OTHER WITH A POOR. ON OUT BIRTH

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:44.276
REGGAE. ENGINES THEMSELVES BUT

00:25:44.342 --> 00:25:45.810
WE CAN WORK WITH THE PORTS AND

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:48.947
THE- AND THE OWNERS OF THE OF

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:52.083
THE- BIRTH THERE TO MAKE SURE

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.818
THAT WHEN THE SHIPS CALL THEY

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:57.589
ARE SWITCHING TO ELECTRICITY-

00:25:57.656 --> 00:25:58.757
WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO

00:25:58.823 --> 00:26:00.358
ELECTRIFY TRANSPORT

00:26:00.425 --> 00:26:03.194
REFRIGERATION UNITS- TO POWER

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:04.262
THE THAT POWER THE

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:06.097
REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS ON TRUCKS

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:08.400
AND- SHIPPING CONTAINERS. AND

00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:10.502
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE PLAN

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:13.204
TO ALSO PROPOSE REGULATIONS FOR

00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:14.406
ZERO EMISSION CARGO HANDLING

00:26:14.472 --> 00:26:16.274
EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS ON ROAD

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:18.310
DRAINAGE TRACKS. ALL OF WHICH

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:19.477
ARE CRITICAL FOR REDUCING

00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:21.246
EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:23.648
MOVING CARGO THROUGH PORTS AND

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:26.251
RAIL YARDS SO WITH ALL OF

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:30.388
THESE- MOVEMENTS A FOOT AND A

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.257
TREMENDOUS INVESTMENTS GOING ON

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:33.825
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:35.460
DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES

00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:37.595
HERE. I NEED TO ALSO POINT OUT

00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:39.831
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A SYSTEM

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.633
APPROACH HERE THIS IS NOT JUST

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.202
ABOUT A TRUCK OR A PIECE OF

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.204
EQUIPMENT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A

00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:48.239
ROBUST FEELING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:50.475
NETWORK AS WELL AS REPAIRS AND

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:52.844
OTHER ASSOCIATED FACILITIES.

00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:54.446
THAT WORK WITH THE IS AB

00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:57.582
VEHICLES AND SO OTHER AGENCIES

00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:59.684
INCLUDING THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:02.520
AND THE CPC ARE BOTH INVOLVED

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:04.489
AND WORKING HARD ON THAT TASK

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:06.558
AND WE CONSIDER THEM ESSENTIAL

00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:08.426
PARTNERS IN THIS IN THIS

00:27:08.493 --> 00:27:10.562
EFFORT. BUT WITH ALL THAT WE

00:27:10.628 --> 00:27:12.464
CAN DO ON TECHNOLOGY AND

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.466
TRANSFORMATION OF THE SYSTEM WE

00:27:14.532 --> 00:27:15.767
ARE GOING TO HAVE INTERNAL

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:18.169
COMBUSTION ENGINES WITH US FOR

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:20.872
MANY YEARS TO COME. AND THAT

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:22.874
MEANS THOSE VEHICLES ARE NOT

00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:24.542
ONLY GONNA NEED TO HAVE- THE

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:27.245
FUEL CONTINUALLY SUPPLIED BUT

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:29.180
HOPEFULLY GETTING CLEANER AND

00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:34.352
LESS- CO TWO- INTENSIVE- WE

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:36.654
ALSO NEED TO FIND WAYS TO

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:39.858
ACTUALLY. REDUCE THE NEED TO

00:27:39.924 --> 00:27:43.528
USE THOSE THOSE VEHICLES AND

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:44.596
AGAIN THIS IS ONE WHERE. A ARE

00:27:44.662 --> 00:27:46.664
B. HAS AUTHORITY AS SOME PIECE

00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:50.468
OF WHAT HAS TO BE DONE- SO

00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:53.138
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE WAYS

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:54.139
ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE

00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:56.841
TODAY- WE'VE SEEN SOME

00:27:56.908 --> 00:27:58.176
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND AGAIN NOT

00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:01.112
JUST ATTRIBUTABLE TO A RP BUT-

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.748
WORKING WITH- PR WE- CHANGE THE

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.050
DEFINITION THAT'S USED IN C.

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:06.418
CA. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:08.153
PROJECT AND YOU WANT TO SEE

00:28:08.219 --> 00:28:09.454
WHAT THE EFFECTIVE IT'S GOING

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:10.655
TO BE ON TRANSPORTATION

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.724
EMISSIONS WE DON'T JUST LOOK AT

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:15.293
THE OLD- METRIC OF LEVEL OF

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.095
SERVICE THAT IMPLIED THAT JUST

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:18.930
GETTING PLACES. GETTING PEOPLE

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:20.198
FROM PLACE TO PLACE AS QUICKLY

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:21.266
AS POSSIBLE THROUGH AN

00:28:21.332 --> 00:28:22.567
INTERSECTION WAS GOING TO BE

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:24.402
THE ONLY. METRIC THAT WE WERE

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:26.805
GONNA DO AS WE NOW LOOK AT. THE

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:29.941
M. T. AS AN E. A MORE EASILY

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:32.444
TRANSLATE A BULL- MEASUREMENT

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.412
AND THAT IN TURN HAS

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:36.981
IMPLICATIONS FOR. WHAT

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.783
ALTERNATIVES WE MIGHT WANT TO

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:39.984
BE LOOKING AT WHEN IT COMES TO

00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:44.823
NEW PROPOSED LAND USE PROJECTS-

00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:46.524
REDUCING THE NEED TO DRIVE AS

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:48.560
SECRETARY SAID INCLUDES A LOT

00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:50.628
OF OTHER. OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:28:50.695 --> 00:28:54.899
INVESTMENT IN ALTERNATE IS AND

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:57.035
IT HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:28:57.102 --> 00:29:01.106
EFFORT TIONS. COMMUNITIES

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:02.540
SERVED. GET DEAL WITH RELATED

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:03.541
ISSUES CONGESTION AND LONGER

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:05.944
COMMITTEE TIMES WE RECENTLY

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.414
HAVE FORTIFIED OUR WORK ON SB

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:10.014
THREE SEVENTY FIVE TO TRY TO

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:11.816
STRENGTHEN THE LONG TERM GOALS

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:13.184
THERE. IN THE HOPE THAT THAT

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:16.054
WILL ALSO BE AN INCENTIVE FOR

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:17.422
COMMUNITIES TO LOOK MORE

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.591
SERIOUSLY AT PROJECTS THAT THEY

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:21.359
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.361
THAT JUST INCREASED CAPACITY

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:25.263
FOR. VEHICLES BUT DON'T

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.965
ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO HELP

00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:28.967

HOW HOW WE MOVE THAT BEYOND A

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:11.362
GOOD FIGHT DISCUSSION- YOU KNOW

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:13.431
WE MAY BE PLANNING BEEN HAVING

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:14.299
CHATS ABOUT HOW TO BEST

00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:16.000
IMPLEMENT BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF

00:32:16.067 --> 00:32:17.535
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WITH SB

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.703
THIRTY THREE SEVEN FIVE IS THAT.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.937
IT DOESN'T AUTUMN AND WE HAVE

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:22.940
ENOUGH TEETH- YOU KNOW ARE WE

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:23.441
WE'RE NOT FINDING WHEN I

00:32:23.508 --> 00:32:25.076
BUILDING THOSE PROJECTS. HOW DO

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:26.944
YOU TRANSLATE THAT CONVERSATION

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:27.478
INTO SOMETHING IT'S MORE

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:30.715
TANGIBLE. WELL AS AS I'M SURE

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:32.650
THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS VERY WELL

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:34.952
ANY DISCUSSIONS THAT INVOLVE-

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:36.988
WHAT SEEN AS INTERFERING WITH

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:39.090
LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS. MEET

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:40.958
WITH- PRETTY STRONG RESISTANCE

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:42.827
WHEN IT COMES TO THE- LOCAL

00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:45.129
LAND USE AGENCIES AND EVEN WITH

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:46.998
THE OVER RIDING STATE GOALS HAS

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:50.802
BEEN VERY HARD. FOR US TO. DO A

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:53.371
LOT ESPECIALLY. WHEN THERE

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:55.606
AREN'T A LOT OF CARROTS- BUT

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:57.408
CERTAINLY NOT MUCH WITH STICKS-

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:59.844
THE PARENT WITH SB THREE

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:00.445
SEVENTY FIVE WAS SUPPOSED TO

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:04.449
BE. EXPEDITED REVIEW AND

00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:05.950
BASICALLY ELIMINATING THE

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:07.285
OBSTACLE OF HAVING TO LOOK AT

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:10.188
THE GREENHOUSE GAS. IMPACTS OF

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:11.556
PROJECTS THAT TRIGGERED SEE

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:12.390
CA THAT WAS WHAT WAS

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:15.360
SUPPOSED TO. BE THE- THING THAT

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:18.463
GOT LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WILLING

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:21.332
TO ACCEPT- PLEASE MORE STRICT

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:23.067
AND RIVER COMMENCED. LOOKING AT

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:25.837
G. H. T. OR REALLY VMT RELATED

00:33:25.903 --> 00:33:28.172
OUR GUEST. AN A. R. P.'S ROLE

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:30.975
IN THAT WAS LIMITED TO HAVING

00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:32.477
THE TARGETS WHICH WE DID AND-

00:33:32.543 --> 00:33:38.750
WITH. THE MPO. AND THEN TO.

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.051
OKAY AT THE ANTHEM SO THAT WERE

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:41.018
DEVELOPED AND SAY WHY THEY MET

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:43.020
THOSE TARGET AND YOU KNOW THE-

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:46.257
THERE'S A LOT OF- A LOT OF ROOM

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.693
FOR- VEGA DONE US OR

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.928
INTERPRETATION IN THESE KINDS

00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:54.298
OF- OF EXERCISES AND WHERE IT

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:56.467
GETS TO BE REALLY INTENSE AS

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.069
WHEN. YOU'VE GOT A SPECIFIC

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.405
PROJECT UNDER WAY I SUDDENLY

00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:02.140
OPPONENTS AND PROPONENTS ARE

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:04.208
ALL GATHERED AROUND YOU KNOW

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:06.878
EAGERLY TRYING TO USE THE-

00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:10.515
PROCESS- AS A WAY TO ATTACK- OR

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:12.350
SUPPORT OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:13.584
THE PROJECT IS I'VE BEEN.

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:14.752
PERSONALLY WATCHING THE

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:16.654
EVOLUTION OF SOME OF OUR

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:19.123
EFFORTS- TO LOOK AT STADIUM

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.726
PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE RECENTLY

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:25.096
AND SEEING HOW- A SUBSTANTIALLY

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:27.365
IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT A GIVEN

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:29.367
PROJECT AND MAKE A FINDING THAT

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:32.170
IT WILL NOT- EVER HAVE A

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:34.405
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON AG EMISSIONS

00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:36.307
IN THE FUTURE I MEAN WE DO IT

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:38.075
BECAUSE- WE'RE REQUIRED TO AND

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:39.877
WE GO THROUGH AN EXERCISE AND-

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:42.346
YOU KNOW WE FOUND WAYS. TO

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:44.315
CONVINCED THE DEVELOPERS IN

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:46.117
THESE CASES THERE YOU KNOW

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:48.453
LARGE AND WELL HEELED ENTITIES

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:50.421
AND SO IT'S RELATIVELY EASY

00:34:50.488 --> 00:34:52.690
COMPARED TO SOME SITUATIONS TO

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:54.892
GET PEOPLE TO AGREE TO PUT IN A

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:57.061
LECTURE CHARGING AND CREATE

00:34:57.128 --> 00:34:59.363
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSES AND-

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.165
BUT- ABSENCE OF A MORE

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:03.468
INTEGRATED APPROACH. THAT THE

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:06.370
COMMUNITIES BY INTO AND THAT-

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.239
THE AGENCIES ARE ALL A PART OF

00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:10.541
ITS IT FEELS SOMETIMES LIKE AN

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:14.011
EXERCISE IN FUTILITY BECAUSE

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:14.745
YOU KNOW THERE'S A DESPERATE

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:16.914
NEED TO THESE. PROJECTS IN THE

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:18.950
MINDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO BUILD

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:22.954
THEM AND SUPPORT THEM. AND.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.258
COMMUNITIES GENERALLY AT LEAST.

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:28.359
IT IF IT. IN THIS KIND OF CRAP.

00:35:28.426 --> 00:35:29.193
AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE GOING

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:29.861
TO BE A- BY THE ADDITIONAL

00:35:29.927 --> 00:35:32.296
TRAFFIC OR- FEEL LIKE IT'S

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:34.832
GONNA YOU KNOW. HAVE A NEGATIVE

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:37.268
IMPACT ON THEIR- QUALITYOF

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:39.237
LIFE ARE FIERCELY OPPOSED AND

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:41.639
YOU FIND YOURSELF HAVING THIS

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:43.574
BATTLE BEING FOUGHT OVER

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:46.010
GREENHOUSE GASES AS OPPOSED TO

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:47.645
WHETHER THIS IS ACTUALLY A YOU

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:49.313
KNOW A GOOD A GOOD THING TO BE

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.382
DOING ARE NOT. ALL I'M SAYING

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:53.518
ABOUT THAT IS THAT I THINK WE

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:56.087
NEED A BROADER BASED PLANNING

00:35:56.153 --> 00:35:58.022
APPROACH- TO THROUGH TO GET TO

00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:59.757
WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND PEOPLE

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:01.792
HAVE SAID THAT FOR A LONG TIME

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:03.194
BUT I CAN WHAT'S ABOUT. BEING

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:04.662
THOUGHTFUL AND BUT THE MADE

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:05.997
WITH YOU THERE'S LEAN

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:08.266
CERTIFICATION AND THEN AND THEN

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:08.799
AND THEN I DON'T THINK WE

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:09.367
SHOULD BE APPROVING ANYMORE

00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:10.334
MAJOR STADIUM PROJECTS ABOUT IN

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:13.271
YOUR RAIL AND IT. COMPONENT TO

00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:16.040
EVERY PROJECT THAT HAS TO BE A

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:16.607
GIVEN I THINK AT THIS POINT

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:20.044
GIVEN THE WAY. OVER AND SEVERAL

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:20.912
YEAR AND I IT WAS A MISSED AND

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:23.514
I WE NEED TO. YOU KNOW. WE HAVE

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.416
WE'RE WE'RE BUILDING OUT IT AND

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:26.150
MASSIVE FROM TRANSIT SYSTEM IN

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:28.085
LA. I'LL GET THE LYMPICS COMING

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:28.753
UP IT'S THE LARGEST

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.121
TRANSPORTATION IS LARGEST

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:32.223
TRANSIT. BUILD OUT IN THE

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.025
NATION RIGHT NOW AND- I ANOTHER

00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:35.393
ELECTION ISN'T IT TO TRY TO

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:37.428
CREATE A REAL SPUR- TO THE

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:43.000
STADIUM. AND SO YEAH FOR

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:45.670
ANYHOW- LOOK AT ONE OF THE QUIT

00:36:45.736 --> 00:36:47.338
WHY WHEN ASKED ABOUT ABOUT

00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:49.707
AVIATION YOU KNOW THAT SEEMS IS

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:53.744
ENORMOUS AREA OF EMISSIONS AND-

00:36:53.811 --> 00:36:57.548
I KNOW. IT SEEMS THAT WE JUST.

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:59.183
WE JUST SAY WELL WE DON'T HAVE

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.619
ANY ROLL OVER ANY EMISSIONS

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:03.187
ASSOCIATED WITH OUT OF STATE

00:37:03.254 --> 00:37:06.023
TRAVEL AND IS THAT A TERRIBLY

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.426
TRUE AND CAN WE DO

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:10.194
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE GIVEN ALL

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.195
THE EXCITING THINGS THAT ARE

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.264
HAPPENING WITH SHORT LEGS

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:17.468
ELECTRIFICATION AND BIO FUEL

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:18.202
OPPORTUNITIES THE AVIATION

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:21.272
SECTOR. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:23.074
THAT WE DON'T GET TO SET AN

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.609
EMISSIONS STANDARD FOR

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:26.677
AIRPLANES THE WAY WE DEAL WITH-

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:29.647
CARS OR- BANDS AND SO FORTH

00:37:29.714 --> 00:37:31.916
BUT- WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN

00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:34.452
THIS SPACE BOTH IN ENCOURAGING

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:37.521
AND SUPPORTING- TRANSITION TO

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:40.524
CLEANER AVIATION FEELS. AND

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:43.427
ALSO- WE'RE SEE I'M SOME REALLY

00:37:43.494 --> 00:37:45.896
EXCITING WORK GOING ON- MOSTLY

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:48.466
FILL IN THE PRE COMMERCIAL

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:49.333
SPACE BUT SOME OF IT MOVING

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.369
TOWARDS COMMERCIALIZATION FOR

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:54.505
SHORT HAUL AVIATION TO BE ZERO

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:57.074
EMISSION- AIRCRAFT THERE

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:59.276
ACTUALLY ARE NOW WORKING

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:01.979
DEMONSTRATIONS OF AIRPLANES

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:04.048
THAT COULD TO DO A FAIR AMOUNT

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:06.550
OF THE- SMALL BOWL- TRIPS THE

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:09.020
SHORT HOPS THAT VIEWS. ARE USED

00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:11.756
FOR DELIVERY PACKAGES MAIL

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:13.891
ETCETERA- IN A COMPLETELY ERO

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:17.662
EMISSION MODE THE AIRPORTS

00:38:17.728 --> 00:38:18.863
THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN INTERESTED

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:20.798
AND HAVE BEEN WORKING- PLAY

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:22.433
ACCESS TO IS ONE. RAIMES

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.002
MIGLIOR WITH DILIGENTLY FOR YOU

00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:26.971
IS THAT WITH A LOT OF PUSH FROM

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:29.240
THE SOUTH COAST DISTRICT TO

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:33.844
ALLOW UP TO FIVE THE THING ON

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:42.987
BROWN'S. ITEMS USED SMOKE. YEAH

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:46.857
I'M WHAT ABOUT I WANT ONE OF

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:48.559
THE ONE I SEE THAT YOU YOU MADE

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:51.262
SOME PRETTY. WE HAVE A- STRONG

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:52.530
COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEED TO

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:55.966
TRANSITION- AWAY FROM- INTERNAL

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:59.403
COMBUSTION ENGINE- IF THAT

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.338
TRULY HAPPENS DOES IS THE MTS

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:04.875
BIGGER PROBLEM. MOVING FORWARD.

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:07.044
HI IN THE IDEA BEING THAT DATE

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:08.779
RIGHT NOW WE ASSOCIATE VMT SO

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.181
MUCH WITH THE MISSIONS BECAUSE

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:11.348
WE WERE DOING AND WE'RE DOING

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:13.217
SO ON THE BASIS OF THINKING

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:15.786
ABOUT A CAR AS A- AS A HEAVY

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:19.323
POLLUTER- BUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.124
SIGNIFICANTLY TRANSCEND

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.692
TRANSITIONED OF THE OUR

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.294
AUTOMOBILE AND TRUCK FLEET.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.695
TOWARD LOWING LOWER POLLUTING

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:27.164
VEHICLES IS MUTE VEHICLE MILES

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:29.166
TRAVELED SPEAK A PROBLEM. OF IT

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:31.368
AS- AT OF SUGGESTIONS THAT WE

00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:32.636
SHOULD BE LOOKING IN A

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:34.505
DIFFERENT WAY AT A CLEAN MILE

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:35.973
STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.541
DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH

00:39:37.608 --> 00:39:39.276
VEHICLES ARE BEING USE. THAT

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:41.345
MIGHT BEA METRIC THAT YOU KNOW

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:43.114
SOMEBODY HAS EVEN A VERY CLEAN

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.750
VEHICLE BUT IT'S BEING USED.

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:48.552
MOST OF THE DAY TO ADD IN SOME

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:50.287
INSTANCES IN AN AUTONOMOUS

00:39:50.354 --> 00:39:52.990
FASHION WHEN IT ISN'T EVEN.

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:54.825
CARRYING ANYBODY OR ANYTHING-

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:57.328
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. THE OVERALL

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:58.996
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT FOR

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:01.165
TRAFFIC FURTHER ROADS THE-

00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:03.634
SAFETY THESE AREA. THE NO

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:05.736
QUESTION ABOUT IT IT'S A BIG

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:06.971
PROBLEM YET TRAFFIC CONGESTION

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:09.173
PERSPECTIVE YEAH SO FROM A FOR

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.176
A RARE. PERSPECTIVE IF IT'S

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:15.513
REALLY BEING READ. THIS IS.

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.414
EMISSIONS AND FUEL MEANING THE

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:20.084
OTHER. IS ALL RENEWABLE YOU CAN

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:23.621
GET PRETTY CLOSE TO A ZERO- A

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:26.624
ZERO EMISSIONS MODEL AND- I

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.726
THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT. OF

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:32.663
THAT ESPECIALLY IN URBAN AREAS

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.565
YEAH. WE WENT WITH IN MIND I

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:35.666
KNOW OF THE PRICE YOU PRICE A

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:37.334
LITTLE MADE A BRIEF ALLUSION I

00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:38.269
KNOW A CONTRA TOPIC BUT I THINK

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:39.570
IT IMPORTANT SUSPENSE MORE TIME

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:41.305
LOOKING AT- I WAS AT A

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:42.573

THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.949
ABOUT CONGESTION. PRICING

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:53.184
SOMEONE WHO. SOME MODELS HAVE

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.218
BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN EUROPE

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:57.121
WHERE. WHERE WE- ON ON THOSE

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.023
DISCUSSIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL

00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.590
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE MISTER

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:01.892
SECRETARY. PRICES A HUGELY

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:03.260
IMPORTANT STRATEGY IN AS YOU

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:04.795
POINTED OUT CHAIRMAN ALAN IT IS

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.964
CONTROVERSIAL IT IS SENSITIVE.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.766
BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:09.366
CONVERSATIONS IF WE'RE GONNA

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:11.135
GET SERIOUS ABOUT REDUCING VMT

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:12.736
REDUCING. GREENHOUSE GAS

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.705
EMISSIONS AND- URGING GREATER

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:18.475
MOTIONS AND SO I'M REALLY

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:19.009
ENCOURAGED THAT UP. ORDER

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.711
PRICING IS BEING EXPORTED LA

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.913
BY- WEST OF WEST LA BY ONLY

METRO SKAGGS OF THE BAY AREA IS

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:26.116
DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR I

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:27.751
BELIEVE RUN TREASURE ISLAND.

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:29.220
AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:31.121
CONVERSATIONS WE NEED TO HAVE.

00:41:31.188 --> 00:41:33.457
AND SO AT THE STATE LEVEL- WORK

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:35.125
FOR GAEA AND WE NEED WE NEED TO

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:36.660
HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS OF.

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:37.995
PROFESSOR BARNETT I KNOW HIM

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:40.197
WELL- WHEN THE LEADING EXPERTS

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:43.133
WHEN IT COMES TO PRICING. AND

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.001
WHEN IT COMES TO PARKING

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:46.237
PRICING DYNAMIC PRICING CORDON

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:48.272
PRICING YOU CONGESTION PRICING

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:49.039
THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN DO

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:50.741
THIS- IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR AND

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:53.143
EQUITABLE. AND ACHIEVE THE

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.445
OUTCOMES THAT WE WHICH IS OUR-

00:41:54.511 --> 00:41:56.313
OKAY AND THEN I WANT TO ASK YOU

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.350
SB SECRETARY- WE TALKED ABOUT

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:01.085
TRYING TO. REDUCE OUR

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:04.054
EMISSIONS. BUT THERE'S ALSO THE

00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:06.390
FACT THAT THE CLIMATE IMPACTS

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:08.726
ARE. MARK ON AN- IMPACT OUR

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:09.894
SYSTEM IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.429
REGARDLESS OF THE WORK WE DO-

00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:13.797
I'VE I WANTED TO RAISE A

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:14.832
CONCERN ABOUT THE EXTENT TO

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:15.566
WHICH CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE BEING

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:16.867
CONSIDERED BY STATE ENGINEERS

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:18.068
AS ROADS AND HIGHWAYS ARE

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:20.871
BEING. PLANNEDAND BUILT AND-

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:21.438
CAN YOU GIVE US AN

00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:24.475
UNDERSTANDING AS TO AS TO. WHAT

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:26.710
TO WHAT EXTENT OUR PLANNERS IN

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:27.611
OUR ENGINEERS ARE

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:30.314
INCORPORATING. BEST THE BEST

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.850
POSSIBLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ABOUT

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:33.984
HAD THE GROWING IMPACT OF

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.185
CLIMATE ON OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:36.620
INFRASTRUCTURE. AS ARE MAKING

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:39.156
PLANS ABOUT I'D WITH THE REST

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.257
OF BUILDING BRIDGES AND ROADS

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:42.259
AND EVERYTHING ELSE. CALTRANS

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:44.128
HAS LAUNCHED A SERIES OF-

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:45.229
CLIMATE VULNERABILITY

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:47.064
ASSESSMENTS IN EACH OF THE

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:48.599
TWELVE CALTRANS DISTRICTS SO

00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:51.235
THEY ARE- GOING ALL OUT TO

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:52.970
REALLY BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:54.238
DEGREE TO WHICH- OUR CURRENT

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:55.539
INFRASTRUCTURE IS IMPACTED BY

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:57.441
SEA LEVEL RISE ANOTHER.

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:58.208
EXAMPLES OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO

00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:00.311
WE'VE GOT OUT THAT'S A GOOD

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:02.012
BASELINE OF INFORMATION AND WE

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.414
CAN BUILD ON THAT IN TERMS OF

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.715
HOW DO WE BUILD RESILIENCY INTO

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:07.751
PROJECTS. EXAMPLE IS INTERNAL

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:10.154
WHITE HOUSE USER IS HIGHWAY%

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.356
THIRTY SEVEN- WHICH IS-

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:14.591
SURROUNDS IN AND SURROUNDS THE

00:43:14.658 --> 00:43:16.794
BAY AND WE'RE SEEING IMPACTS OF

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:19.129
THAT AND THEY'RE OLD WE NEED TO

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:22.199
BE A LONG TERM SOLUTION- IN THE

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:23.100
FORM OF EITHER RAIING. THE

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:25.536
ROADWAY FOR MOVING AWAY SO HUGE

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:26.904
AND CENTERED ON SORRY SENATOR

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:31.508
DODGE AREA YES- AND SO THAT'S A

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:32.710
GOOD THAT' A IT'S ALMOST LIKE

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:34.078
A POSTER CHILD FOR ON THE

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:35.913
IMPACT O CLIMATE CHANGE ON ON

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.981
THE TRANSPORTATION OF SOLD

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:38.115
EITHER OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:41.318
BUT- THE TO THE TO CLASSIC.

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:43.320
OKAY SHOULD THE ARBOR THE STEAM

00:43:43.387 --> 00:43:47.624
TRANSPORTATION. IF YOU TOOK A

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:49.960
HISTORICALLY- OF WHAT THE

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:51.195
FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:53.430
GOVERNMENTS HAVEDONE IN TERMS

00:43:53.497 --> 00:43:56.600
OF. YOU KNOW FINANCING

00:43:56.667 --> 00:44:00.404
TRANSPORTATION OF WE COULD

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:00.871
START WITH THE FEDERAL

00:44:00.938 --> 00:44:03.574
GOVERNMENT. NINETEEN EIGHTY

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.642
NINE- SO WAS THE LAST TIME THEY

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.444
RAISED- ANY KIND OF REVENUE

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:12.249
INCREASES FOR TRANSPORTATION.

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:14.418
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND-

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.453
BECAUSE THE GAS TAX IS A PER

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:21.258
GALLON TAX- IT DOESN'T RESPOND

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:25.062
TO INFLATION SO IT WE LOST THE-

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:28.232
OVER TIME- BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:32.302
DUE TO. THE INFLATION FROM THE

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:33.404
FEDERAL SHARE OF-

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.973
TRANSPORTATION THERE THE STATE

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.010
SO. OF INCREASE THE GASOLINE

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:41.712
TAX IN NINETY TWO AND THEN THE

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:46.884
SP ONE. AND WE ALSO INCREASED A

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:48.218
VEHICLE MADE HIS FEE AND THE

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:50.854
DIESEL FUEL TAX DIESEL FUEL TAX

00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:53.657
WENT TO TRANSIT. THE FUNDING

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:57.494
SOME OF THE TRANSIT PROGRAMS.

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.896
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF PAST-

00:44:58.962 --> 00:45:04.435
SO- SALES TAX INCREASES. OF

00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:06.370
SOME COUNTIES HAVE SUCCEEDED

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:10.507
SOME HAVE NOT. IN OTHER

00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:14.344
COUNTIES THE- THEY TRIED OF IT

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:16.947
BUT IT REQUIRES OF COURSE A TWO

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:19.850
THIRDS VOTE- AND SO WE HAVE

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:21.718
SOME WINNERS AND LOSERS THERE

00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:25.556
IN TERMS OF FUNDING- THE STATE

00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:27.591
ALSO DID BONDING IN TWO

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:29.426
THOUSAND AND SIX THE TWENTY

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:30.561
BILLION DOLLAR TRANSIT

00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:34.164
TRANSPORTATION BOND AND- FOR

00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:37.468
BILLION AND HOUSING IN TWO

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:40.204
THOUSAND AND SIX AND IN TWO

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:41.405
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOR BILL FOR

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:44.842
OUSTING. SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:49.113
FUNDING. TRANSPORTATION AND

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:53.317
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IF

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:56.587
YOU DEVELOP A PLAN ARE YOU. IF

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:58.489
YOU DEVELOP A PLAN DON'T TRY TO

00:45:58.555 --> 00:45:59.523
COME UP WITH A WAY OF FINDING

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.058
IT I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BIG

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:03.627
MISTAKE. I THINK I THINK YOU

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:04.595
HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN THAT

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:05.829
ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING OR

00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:07.898
OTHER AND GATHERS DUST ON. THE

00:46:07.965 --> 00:46:11.768
ACADEMICS BOOKSHELVES SO. WOULD

00:46:11.835 --> 00:46:13.270
YOU CONSIDER WHAT KIND OF

OPTIONS WE HAVE FOR. FUNDING

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.842
TRANSPORTATION THAT ARE

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:20.878
RESPONSIVE TO THE- GOALS WE

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:22.212
HAVE FOR GREENHOUSE GAS

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:24.481
EMISSION REDUCTIONS COULD YOU

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:26.049
COULD YOU CONSIDER BONDING

COMMITTEE. SB ONE. A

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:39.890
MAGNIFICENT ACCOMPLISHMENT. IT

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:41.992
DOES NOT MEET ALL THE NEEDS OF

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:42.893
THE STATE WHEN IT COMES

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.828
TRANSPORTATION- THE US

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:46.630
DEPARTMENT TRAVELS DAILY FOR.

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:48.832
BACKLOG OF REPAIRS THAT WOULD

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:51.201
HAVE BEEN DONE FOR. DECADES

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:53.303
CORRECT THAT'S AND- THE FEDERAL

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:54.404
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION EVERY

00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:55.772
YEARPUTS OUT A REPORT CALLED

00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:56.773
THE ANNUAL CONDITIONS AND

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.841
PERFORMANCE REPORT WHICH LOOKS

00:47:57.908 --> 00:47:59.509
OUT. WHAT IT WOULD COST TO

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:00.877
MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM BOTH

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:02.779
HIGHWAYS AND TRANSIT. AND WHAT

00:48:02.846 --> 00:48:03.814
WOULD IT COST TO IMPROVE THE

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.315
SYSTEM THERE IS NOT ENOUGH NOT

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:07.985
ENOUGH MONEY. TO MAINTAIN. LET

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.987
ALONE IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. AND

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:12.389
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE- NOT UNIQUE

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.157
TO CALIFORNIA'S NATIONWIDE

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:15.626

PARTNERSHIPS. NOW THAT IS NOT A

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:22.866
REPLACEMENT FOR PUBLIC FUND

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:25.235
FUNDING- THREES WORK IN SOME

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:26.136
SINCE THE TUITIONS BUT NOT

00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:30.274
EVERYWHERE- AND SO ALL THOSE

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:30.841
ALL THOSE OPTIONS MUST BE ON

00:48:30.907 --> 00:48:31.575
THE TABLE. IF THE FOR MY

BILLING- METRO. IN LOS ANGELES.

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:36.446
AND I END UP BECAUSE OF LACK OF

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:38.315
FINANCE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:41.752

ANY OF THESE TRANSIT PROJECTS

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.428
ARE ALL IT'S ALL THE SAME OKAY

00:48:51.495 --> 00:48:52.996
IS NO DIFFERENT REALLY BUT YOUR

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.197
BILL IT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:55.766
BECAUSE THEY'RE MOSTLY MOSTLY

00:48:55.832 --> 00:48:59.269
LOCALLY FUNDED. THEY'RE

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:01.038
BUILDING I'M IN PHASES. THE

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:04.241
BUILDING AND PIECES. AND

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:06.109
BUILDING THINGS IN PIECES.

00:49:06.176 --> 00:49:07.377
DOESN'T ACHIEVE WHAT WE'RE

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:08.545
TRYING TO DO WITH THE

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:10.881

TRANSIT THE GOES FROM POINT A

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.720
TO POINT B. COMPLETED RATHER

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.455
THAN LITTLE. PIECES ALONG THE

00:49:18.522 --> 00:49:20.290
WAY LIKE GOING DOWN WILSHIRE

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:23.226
BOULEVARD- GOING GOING THROUGH

00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:25.295
THE LOS ANGELES METRO GETTING

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.866
THE ROOM THE LINES THAT THEY'RE

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:32.102
TRYING TO BUILD AND SAN DIEGO

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:35.539
AND- AND- EXTENSION OF THE

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:39.443
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION. IN TO-

00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:42.646
MEANT FOR OR- WE SHOULD NOT WE

00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:43.814

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.149
THINGS BECAUSE OF WE GET OF GET

00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:49.186
IT DONE QUICKER. THE DIVIDEND

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:52.255
IS MORE TONS OF POLLUTANTS OUT

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:53.890
OF THERE RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:55.292
YOU GET YOU GET BETTER GET

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:56.393
BETTER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IF

YOU FINANCE THINGS LIKE THAT

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:00.497
AND GET HIM BUILT OSCAR. EVEN

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:01.565
THOUGH YOU MIGHT BE PAYING HIM

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.767
OFF OVER TIME YOU'RE STILL

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:07.270
GETTING A DIVIDEND THAT EXCEEDS

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:09.706
THE INTEREST COST. IS WHAT I'M

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.842
SAYING YOU KNOW AND- PROBABLY

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:14.578
THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS LOST. SO

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:16.546
IS THERE IS IT DO YOU HAVE SOME

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:18.215
SCHEMES THAT ARE BEING WORKED

00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:22.219
OUT. TO PROPOSE. SOME FINANCING

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:23.387
FOR SOME OF THE TRANSIT

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:25.188
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. I

00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:26.990
THINK YOU CORRECTLY POINTED OUT

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.959
THE FACT THE REALITY THAT WHEN

00:50:29.025 --> 00:50:30.827
IT COMES TO TRANSIT EXTENSIONS

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:33.263
WEATHERBY BARGE SAN JOSE OR THE

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.698
LA NATURAL PURPLE LINE

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:35.899
EXTENSION. THOSE ARE BEING DONE

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:37.434
IN PHASES BECAUSE THAT THE READ

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:39.035
THE FUNDING FOR PULLING OUT A

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.871
COUPLE ON. THE REALITY OF

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.038
FUNDING THE WAY THESE FUNDING

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:43.373
PROGRAMS WORK ESPECIALLY THE

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.042
FEDERAL LEVEL DOES NOT ALLOW.

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:47.744
IN TIRED EXTENSION TO BE BUILT

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.780
IN ONE FELL SWOOP AND UNTIL

00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:51.014
THERE IS WHOLESALE CHANGE

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:52.849
ESPECIALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:55.919
IN TERMS OF HOW. TRANSIT

00:50:55.986 --> 00:51:00.490
PROJECTS AND SYSTEMS ARE OFF.

00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:01.124
FOR IT'S GOING TO BE THAT MEAL

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:02.426
UP. THAT SIMPLY THE WAY THIS IS

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:04.361
SET UP SPECIAL THE FEDERAL. AND

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:06.763
DELETED DURABILITY BE A CHANGE

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:07.864
ON THAT NOW THIS THE TRIGGER

00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:08.832
THAT'S MY NEXT QUESTION THE

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:11.868
FEDERAL- THE FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:12.803

THIS SHOULD BE A KEY ISSUE IN

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.541
THIS SPECIALLY IN THE

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:26.676

THERE IS A LANGUAGE ON RESERVE

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.297
RESILIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:48.732

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:36.272
WAS LOOKING A RODENT REPAIRED

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:38.141
JUST BACKLOG THERE THAT'S NOT

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:38.942
NECESSARILY REDUCING EMISSIONS

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.944
AT ALL I THINK WE'RE SEVENTY

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:43.680
EIGHT BILLION IT SHORT- BASED

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:46.049
ON. THERE'S A RAND STUDY THAT'S

00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:47.584
JUST ON THAT SIDE A THINK WHAT

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:50.120
WE'RE GONNA FIFTY EIGHT BILLION

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:51.254
OFF SB ONE JUST TO DO THAT SO

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:53.790
THEN. THAT'S JUST MAINTAINING

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:55.458
THE EXISTING SYSTEM. YOU CAN

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:56.493
ARGUE ACTUALLY DOESN'T. DO

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:58.895
ANYTHING MUCH TO HELP. BUT ARE

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:00.330
WE TALKING THAT ORDER OF

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:02.132
MAGNITUDE ARE WE TALKING LIKE

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:03.566
IN A HUNDRED BILLION RANGE ARE

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:05.402
WE TALKING IN THE FIVE BILLION

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.137
RANGE I KNOW SOME OF IT IS

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:09.806
STICKS TO SO I. IT'S A QUESTION

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:13.576
THAT IS A FLUID. IT YOU KNOW

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:15.178
ORIENTATION AND THAT WAY RIGHT

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:17.080
BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU HAVE

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:19.582
STRICTER YELL VMT OR HOUSING

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:21.317
POLICY OR IF YOU POLLED TURN

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:23.420
THIS LEVER HERE ON THE VEHICLE

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.321
SIDE BUT- I'M TRYING TO GET A

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:28.425
SENSE OF. WHAT A REASONABLE

00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:31.027
SCOPE TO IT OVERALL

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:32.962
TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS

00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.563
REDUCTION INVESTMENT STRATEGY

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.232
LOOKS LIKE HERE'S AN EXAMPLE IN

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:38.334
SAN DIEGO- WE'VE GOT THE DEL

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:39.869
MAR BLUFFS WHICH IS JUST NORTH

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.304
OF SAN DIEGO THE CITY OF DEL

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:43.239
MAR. THAT IS HOME TO ONE OF THE

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:45.141
MOST- ACTUALLY CERTIFICATE RAIL

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:48.144
CORRIDORS ANYWHERE- IT'S HOME

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.913
TO THE LOS AND CORRIDOR AMTRAK

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.514
PACIFIC SURFLINER FROM SAN

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:53.016
DIEGO TO LA TO SAN LUIS OBISPO

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:55.752
IT ALSO CARE FREE REAL. DAHLE

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:58.088
MORE BLUFFS IS EXPERIENCING

00:55:58.154 --> 00:55:59.789
SIGNIFICANT EROSION EVERY TIME

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:02.425
THERE'S A MAJOR STORM EVENT AND

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:03.393
THERE ARE EFFORTS UNDERWAY TO

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.694
STABILIZE THOSE PLUS BUT THE

00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:06.796
LONG TERM SOLUTION. IS TO MOVE

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.465
THOSE RAILROAD TRACKS AWAY FROM

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.933
THE BLUFFS. THAT'S A MULTI

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:12.102
BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSITION IF

00:56:12.168 --> 00:56:14.104
YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY ALL THE

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:15.338
PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:17.140
HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY AND

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:19.209
SENATOR DODD'S AREA- MANY

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:21.644
OTHERS HIGHWAY ONE LAST TRANCE

00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:22.078
GREAT UP IN NORTHERN

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:24.247
CALIFORNIA. IT COULD BE I'M

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:25.415
JUST GUESSING BUT IT COULD BE

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:27.117
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IT'S A LOT

00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:30.553
OF MONEY. I WAS JUST GOING TO

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.223
ADD THAT- WE ARE FOCUSED HERE

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:35.759
ADD RIGHTLY SO ON THE PIECE OF

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:38.862
THIS INVOLVES. BE EMPTY BUT- WE

00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:40.430
STILL HAVE TO DO THE

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:42.832
TRANSFORMATION TO. ELECTRIC

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.634
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND WE

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:47.003
DO HAVE A ESTIMATE OF THE PRICE

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.471
ON THAT WHICH IS NOT NEARLY AS

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:52.175
SITE IS SO. GIVE US A SENSE- OF

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.477
WELL THE I THINK A BETWEEN THE

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:56.579
ENERGY COMMISSION AND- A. R. B.

00:56:56.646 --> 00:56:57.881
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK TO

00:56:57.947 --> 00:56:59.149
YOU ON THAT BUT- WE'VE LOOKED

00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:01.284
AT- YOU KNOW KIND OF TEN YEAR

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:03.153
PROJECTIONS TO GET TO THE-

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.621
GOALS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:57:04.687 --> 00:57:06.189
SAID AND IT'S- MORE IN THE

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.223
NEIGHBORHOOD OF A COUPLE OF

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.225
BILLION A YEAR. OVER A TEN YEAR

00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:11.161
PERIOD. AND I MEAN WHEN I LOOK

00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:12.629
HERE I SEE A 5% CONTINUES

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:16.666
APPROPRIATION FOR THE

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:17.333
TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS CHUNK.

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.168
THERE IS NO LONG TERM FUNDING

00:57:18.234 --> 00:57:19.302
STREAM ON LOW CARBON

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:21.304
TRANSPORTATION WRIT LARGE EVERY

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:23.206
YEAR IT'S UP AND DOWN AND CV

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.475
ARPINO C. V. R. P. AND THERE'S

00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:27.010
A LOT OF FITS AND STARTS WHICH-

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:30.113
IS. DEEPLY CONCERNING TO ME

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.015
THAT THE MARKET HAS NO. THERE

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:33.483
BUT I JUST I THINK THOSE

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.018
NUMBERS WOULD. I KNOW THEY'LL

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:36.319
BE INTIMIDATING WHEN YOU ALL

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:38.755
COME BACK TO US WITH THEM- BUT

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:40.290
I THINK WE NEED TO BE HONEST

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:41.124
ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:42.859
CHALLENGE. AND REALLY RIGHT

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:45.161
SIZE OUR CONVERSATION. AND THEN

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:47.764
SAY OKAY. WERE THREE HUNDRED

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:49.766
BILLION DOLLARS SHORT. ARE WHAT

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.000
IS THAT LOOK LIKE BUT MAYBE WE

00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:52.735
CAN EXECUTE. THIS IS A HAVE

00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:54.003
PIECE FOR TWENTY BILLION

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:57.440
DOLLARS OR- GO BEAT THE FOUR OH

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:58.341
FIVE IN THE FIVE FREEWAY FOR

00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:00.610
WHATEVER THE- THE D. I'M- OF

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.846
THE SURFLINER BY THE WAY.

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.047
WAITING FOR THE FREIGHT.

00:58:04.113 --> 00:58:06.349
FRIENDS TO MY FOR AND GOODS

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:08.051
MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE NEED. I

00:58:08.117 --> 00:58:09.919
LOVE THAT LINE ANY TRUST ME TO

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:13.423
KNOW WHEN THEY GOT ME EVEN. WE

00:58:13.489 --> 00:58:13.957
CAN SEE ICE BE REAL TALKED

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:16.593
ABOUT YET IN THIS HEARING- OR

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.328
ON THE LIST OF ANY OF THE

00:58:18.394 --> 00:58:19.696
STRATEGY SO I AM CURIOUS ABOUT

00:58:19.762 --> 00:58:22.131
THAT BUT- I GUESS EVEN SETTING

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:26.603
THAT ASID- THAT SOUTHERN

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:28.905
CALIFORNIA AREA ALONE. DWARFS

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:31.507
THE 25% CONTINUES APPROPRIATION

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:33.009
THAT IS GOING JUST TO HIGH

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:34.811
SPEED RAIL NOW RIGHT I MEAN AND

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.379
VERY LITTLE OF THAT IT'S COMING

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:38.081
DOWN TO LA SO I JUST I WANT TO

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:40.083
RIGHT SIZE THAT CONVERSATION I

00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:40.683
GUESS THE LAST QUESTION WOULD

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:45.088
BE. IS SETTING ASIDE MAYBE THE

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.823
BIG INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE FOR YOU

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.391
SECRETARY CAME IN MAY BE ON THE

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:50.026
SAFE SIDE- AND LOOK IN THAT

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:51.861
SORT OF CARBON SPACE L. CFS

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:53.796
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT HOW TO GET

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:56.165
MAYBE MORE CREATIVE ABOUT THAT

00:58:56.232 --> 00:58:58.334
COMPLIANCE MARKET I KNOW THAT

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:00.570
BILLIONS IN THAT IT'S NOT GOING

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:01.204
TO BE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS BUT

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:03.873
IT'S GOING TO BE TEN BILLION

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.540
OVER THE NEXT DECADE THAT COMES

00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:06.542
IN BUT IT COMES IN AFTER THE

00:59:06.609 --> 00:59:08.211
FACT IN A LOT OF THIS FLOWS OUT

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:09.979
OF STATE. THEIR WAYS TO

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:13.016
MONETIZE YOUR SECURITIZED. SOME

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.751
OF THAT COMPLIANCE MARKET TO

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:16.052
HELP AT LEAST TO THE V.

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:17.587
INFRASTRUCTURE BETTER SO WE

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:18.988
DON'T JUST HAVE TO LEAN ON JI

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:20.757
JURA FOR EVER. YEAH I THINK OF

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.592
THE FIRST PHASE OF OUR EFFORTS

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:24.661
TO KIND OF- THINK MORE

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:26.863
CREATIVELY ABOUT THAT PROGRAM-

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.398
HAVE BEEN TO WORK WITH THE

00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:29.799
ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO TAKE SOME

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:34.003
OF. THE VALUE THAT WENT TO THEM

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.204
FOR MOVING OUT WITH ELECTRIC

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.973
CHARGING STATIONS AS A WAY OF

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.441
GAINING CREDITS. UNDER THE LOW

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:40.843
CARBON FUEL STANDARD. AND HAVE

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.812
THEM CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS A

00:59:42.879 --> 00:59:45.281
PROGRAM THAT WILL PUT. MONEY ON

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:48.718
THE HOOD AS WE SAY OF BUYING A

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:51.554
LECTOR VEHICLES SO GIVE THE

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:54.123
GIVE THE DEALERS AN INCENTIVE

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:57.827
TO BE MORE. ACTIVELY INVOLVED

00:59:57.894 --> 00:59:58.928
AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST.

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:01.230
AND THE WILL TO. DOWN COSTS

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:02.532
UNTIL WE TO REAL PARITY. IN THE

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:05.001
NEW CAR MARKET- BUT THE NEXT

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:08.271
IDEA WHICH YOU'RE ALLUDING TO

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.406
WHICH IS TO HOW TO FOCUS ON WHO

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.222
WE'VE DONE ALL KINDS OF

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:36.626
LEGISLATIVE. FIXES I GUESS WE

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:38.361
HAVE EIGHTY USE NOW THAT WE CAN

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:40.263
PUT IN PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS-

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.931
WHICH DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:45.535
TRANSPORTATION SO WHERE I'M

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:46.202
HEADING WITH THIS IS THAT

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:48.704
POLITICALLY YOU KNOW WE HAD SB

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.106
FIFTY HERE AND WE COULDN'T GET

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:51.340
THE WE COULDN'T GET OUT OF

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:52.775
HERE. IT GOT HUNG UP AND YOU

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.744
KNOW WE HEARD THAT WE'RE GOING

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:56.412
TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN. IN

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:59.048
THAT AREA. AGAIN THIS YEAR AND

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:00.650
THEN WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:02.752
AND I HAPPEN TO BE FORTUNATE

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:03.986
ENOUGH TO SIT ON BOTH THE

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.621
CHAIRMAN'S COMMITTEES AND I'M

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:06.889
REALLY SUPER EXCITED ABOUT

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:09.292
THAT. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.494
OVERLAP IN HOW WE LOOK GLOBALLY

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.863
AT. OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:15.098
NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:17.834
WE REALLY MISS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.503
AND I KNOW THAT. THAT THE CHAIR

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.405
OF THE AIRPORT WHO SAT ON THE

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.107
BIODIVERSITY COUNSELED MANY

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.575
YEARS BACK AND I HAPPENED TO

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:27.443
BE. A PARTICIPATING THAT AS A

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.378
COUNTY SUPERVISOR WITH RC RC IF

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:31.814
YOU RECALL- WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.149
ABOUT FIRE IN WHICH IS

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:34.317
SOMETHING THAT WE PUT IN SB

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:35.818
NINE A ONE TWO. TO CALCULATE

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:38.154
THE AMOUNT OF YOU KNOW FORCE

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:40.490
FIRE MISSIONS THAT WE- YOU

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.592
KNOW. THE AND MET IN CALIFORNIA

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.393
AND I THINK THAT WE MISSED THAT

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.595
WE MISSED THE BOAT THERE THEN

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:47.864
WE DON'T. TALK ABOUT THAT AS

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.398
MUCH AS WE FOCUS ON.

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.334
TRANSPORTATION A LOT AND IT'S A

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.768
VERY HEAVY BURDEN FOR BUSINESS

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:56.172
AND IT'S COST. PER TIME THE

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:57.273
COST IS VERY HIGH AND THEN ON

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.307
THE I WANT TO TOUCH ON THIS

01:02:58.374 --> 01:02:59.842
WHICH- I KNOW NOBODY LIKES TO

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.644
HEAR IT BUT IT'S A FACT. WE

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:03.446
HAVE THE BULLET TRAIN THAT'S

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.481
BEING. SUPER SPENDING BILLIONS

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.083
OF DOLLARS ON THAT AND I I'M

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.751
CONVINCED WE SHOULD CUT OFF

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:11.154
THAT AND- LEAVE IT AND TAKE

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.723
THOSE RESOURCES AND- GO DO.

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:16.325
RAIL TRANSPORTATION. IN IN HIGH

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:17.994
POPULATED AREAS IN THE CITIES

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.295
WHERE WE CAN REALLY MAKE AN

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:21.797
IMPACT ON GHG. SO I JUST WANT

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.266
TO THROW THAT OUT I THINK IT'S

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:23.900
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.868
ON. AND THEN WHEN YOU TALK

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:27.236
ABOUT AND I WANTED ALSO TOUCH

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:30.606
ON. YOU KNOW. YEARS BACK WE

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:31.707
TALKED ABOUT GOING REDUCING

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:34.610
OUR- FOOTPRINT WITH COAL AND

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:35.178
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO NATURAL

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.613
GAS. AND NOW WE WENT FROM

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.383
NATURAL GAS TO BATTERIES THAT'S

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:41.317
WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.186
ABOUT IS STORAGE IN BATTERIES

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:45.188
IN THIS BUILDING SO I HAVE SOME

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.589
COMMENTS ABOUT TV'S I'M

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:47.623
ACTUALLY DOING SOME LEGISLATION

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.192
IN THIS AREA I DID SOME

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:51.661
LEGISLATION THIS AREA ON. ON

01:03:51.727 --> 01:03:53.930
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WHAT

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.364
WE GONNA DO WITH IN THE LIFE OF

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:56.599
BATTERIES NOBODY'S REALLY HAD

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.101
THAT CONVERSATION AND WHAT IS

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.570
THE WHAT IS THE FOOT PRINT LOOK

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:02.572
LIKE TO THE ENVIRONMENT WHEN WE

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:05.274
HAVE A MILLION DVDS AND THEY'RE

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.343
INTO THEIR LIFE IS THERE. SO I

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:09.312
DID SOME LEGISLATION WERE

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:09.845
SUPPOSED TO GET BACK SOME

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:10.780
INFORMATION ON WHAT THE PLAN

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:14.717
IS- GOING FORWARD. SO I WANT TO

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:17.353
JUST. THROW THAT OUT TO YOU I

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.522
ALSO WANT TO SAY. THAT THIS IS

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:21.090
A DIFFICULT SITUATION WE NEED

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.024
TO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.759
HOMES WE IT'LL BUILD. REDUCE

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:27.830
FIELD MILES TRANCE ED THE-

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:30.166
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND YOU

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:31.667
KNOW I HEARD IN YOUR COMMENTS

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.603
YOU SAY THAT YOU KNOW. WE NEED

01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:34.971
A REVOLUTION I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:35.705
KIND OF REVOLUTION YOU'RE

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:37.506
LOOKING FOR BUT- AND ALSO WE

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:38.941
NEED TO PUSH PEOPLE TO GET

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:40.810
WHERE WE WANT TO GO. AND I

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:42.211
THINK THOSE ARE DANGEROUS AREAS

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:44.013
IN THE IN THESE FOR THOSE OF US

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.781
WHO HAVE TO PUT OUR NAME ON THE

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:48.284
BALLOT AND- ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:49.118
PEOPLE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.620
AND I DON'T THINK. THIS IS THE

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:52.855
POINT OF MY MESSAGE. I WANT TO

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.924
BE THE TABLE WITH YOU ALL TO.

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.092
TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS ONE

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:57.960
BY ONE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.161
THEY'RE SILENT BUT HOLISTICALLY

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:02.398
I THINK WE- DON'T DO A VERY

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:04.800
GOOD JOB. BUT WITH TO BRING THE

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:05.701
PUBLIC ALONG WE HAVE NOT SPENT

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:08.571
THEIR MONEY WISELY. I THINK WE

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:11.240
TOO ARE NOT CREDIBLE ONE WHEN

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:11.807
WE COME BACK AND I'M TALKING

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:14.143
ABOUT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:17.013
COST PER TON. I THINK THERE'S

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:18.481
BETTER WAYS WE COULD REDUCE OUR

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.650
CARBON FOOTPRINT AND I AND I

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:21.651
SAY THAT WOULD FORCE FIRE THINK

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:22.918
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD USE NATURAL

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.920
GAS AS A BRIDGE UNTIL WE GET

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.455
THE EEVEE STAGGERED OUT AND

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:27.990
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AS FAR

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:30.393
STORAGE GOES I DON'T THINK

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:30.993
REMAIN CLOSE THEIR TECHNOLOGY

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.862
WISE. A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.730
SAYING THAT BUT THE COST TIME

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:37.266
AND FORCING PEOPLE OUT I HAD

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.068
THE MANUFACTURES OF DVDS-

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.570
OURSELVES BE OTHER CAR DEALERS

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:42.972
WHO ARE FORCED BASICALLY TO

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.874
SOMEONE ON THE LOT THEY'RE NOT.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.375
WE GET ABOUT WE'RE WE'RE

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:47.910
PUSHING THE PUBLIC IN A WAY

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:50.379
THAT I DON'T THINK IS THERE ONE

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:51.447
TO GO OR THEY DON'T LIKE IT AND

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:53.783
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WILL HEAD BUT

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:55.084
I THINK THAT'S DANGEROUS I

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.018
THINK THAT WE'LL GET SOME

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.386
BLOWBACK. AND I THINK WE NEED

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:58.854
TO DO IN A BETTER WAY SO I WANT

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.056
TO BE THE TABLE AS WE SHOULD

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:01.324
HAVE THE OF I THINK WE NEED TO

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.958

THAT. AS ONE. THAT WE NEED

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:20.042
MAYBE SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.910

ACTUALLY REGULATE FUEL ECONOMY

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.624
WE HAVE NO LEGAL AUTHORITY IN

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:17.860
THAT AREA AT ALL. THAT'S ALL

01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.328
UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.230
TRANSPORTATION AND THAT'S A

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:23.032
WHERE WE COME INTO THE PICTURE

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:24.800
IS THAT WE HAVE STANDARDS FOR

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:26.936
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. NOW

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.871
AS IT TURNS OUT GREENHOUSE TO

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.639
MEET A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:33.175
STANDARD FROM A VEHICLE MANY OF

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.277
THE THINGS YOU WOULD DO ALSO

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:36.512
HAVE AN IMPACT ON FEEL ECONOMY

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:39.415
SO THE TWO STANDARDS WERE DONE

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:41.250
TOGETHER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.319
AND THEN CALIFORNIA BOUGHT INTO

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:45.087
IT. BUT WE'RE VERY CAREFUL

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.423
NEVER TO SET A FUEL ECONOMY

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.059
LEVEL OR SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.060
WE'RE DOING WE ARE ONLY

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:54.497
FOCUSING ON ON ON THE HOUSE

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:56.465
GASSES. AND ARE. TO MEET THOSE

01:08:56.532 --> 01:08:58.567
STAND AS THEY ALSO DO SOME

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.102
THINGS RELATING TO OPERATION

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:02.004
THE VEHICLES ACTIVE ERIC THING

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:03.606
SYSTEMS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE

01:09:03.672 --> 01:09:05.407
ONE. ACCOUNT WELL I THINK IN

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.709
THE LONG RUN THAT'S THE

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:08.210
DIRECTION ACTUALLY THAT THE

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:09.745
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.814
HEADED IN AS WELL BECAUSE

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.148
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLAINTS

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:15.150
THAT THE CAFE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:17.720
IT WAS WELL INTENDED TO HELP

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:19.555
SAVE PETROLEUM AND A TIME WHEN

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.524
THAT WAS THE THING WE ARE MOST

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.758
WORRIED ABOUT AS IT'S ACTUALLY

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:27.630
IMPLEMENTED- IT INCENTIVIZE

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.965
LARGER HEAVIER VEHICLES AT THE

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:32.201
EXPENSE OF LESS. Vì AND MORE

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:36.438
FUEL EFFICIENT VIA. HAS OTHERS

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:40.042
ANGEL TEACHERS ARE NOT

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.645
PARTICULARLY. I'M NOT

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:45.481
PARTICULARLY HOPEFUL TODAY IS

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:50.085
CAP A STANDARDS. CAN THEM I IN

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:52.688
THE IN THE TOP FOUR TIME THANK

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:54.223
THE WAY THIS WORKS THE PEOPLE

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.659
GET. AND THEN A CAN SELL BLOOM.

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:57.426
TO OTHER MEN IF. SO THAT PEOPLE

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:59.895
CAN BE IN COMPLIANCE EITHER BY

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:01.096
PRODUCING CARS THAT MEET THE

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:03.465
STANDARD OR BUY CREDITS FROM

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:05.701
OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOT

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:09.872
LIMON ATTY AND SO EVERYONE IS

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:11.407
IN COMPLIANCE AND MOMENT. A LOT

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:12.308
OF THE FIGHT IT'S GOING ON AT

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:13.742
THE PRO LEVEL TO DO THE FACT

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:15.210
THAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.712
COMPANIES THAT ARE NOW MOVING

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:18.547
INTO HAVING TO BUY. MOST OF

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:19.748
THEIR CREDITS BECAUSE THEY

01:10:19.815 --> 01:10:20.983
DON'T HAVE A FLEET THAT MEETS

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.818
THE STANDARDS AND THEY REALLY

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.286
DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.321
POSITION SO THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:27.323
GET THE STANDARDS WEAKENED. AND

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:28.791
I GUESS THAT BRINGS US TO THIS

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.327
ZEV MANDATE BECAUSE WE HAVE WE

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.795
HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:35.331
VEHICLES THAT MUST BE SOLD. IN

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:39.234
CALIFORNIA- BY TWENTY TWENTY

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.436
THREE CAN YOU UPDATE THE

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:42.037
COMMITTEES ON HOW THOSE ARE

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:44.740
GOING BACK BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:46.442
THERE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:47.943
VEHICLES AND THAT'S VERY. THE

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:49.311
LARGEST BIT BUT BUT THAT

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:50.446
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE ON

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:53.215
TARGET TO MEET OUR STANDARDS

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.017
GIVEN THE CURRENT. SENSE IS

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.453
THAT MANDATE- WAS INTENDED TO

01:10:57.519 --> 01:11:00.956
SET A FLOOR. AND WE ARE NOW

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.993
DOING OR OR BACK ON TRACK. WITH

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:06.095
THE WITH THE MANDATE TO GET TO

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:09.264
THE 10% THAT WAS REQUIRED UNDER

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:12.201
THAT REGULATION. BUT AS I

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:14.203
INDICATED IN MY TESTIMONY WE

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:15.838
NEED A LOT MORE THAN THAT. IN

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.139
ORDER TO MEET OUR AIR QUALITY

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:18.607
AND TRANSPORTATION GOALS SO

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:19.875
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.410
WE SHOULD JUST RAISE THE

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.278
MANDATE THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:25.681
SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND- NOT.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.416
WORRY O MUCH ABOUT INCENTIVES

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:29.151
IN THE MARKET AND SO FORTH THAT

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.586
IT HAS BEEN A CONSCIOUS

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:33.055
DECISION ON OUR PART THAT WE

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.657
WOULD DO BETTER. AND IN IN

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.325
LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:37.493
SOMETHING WHERE CONSUMERS

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:39.395
ULTIMATELY HAVE THE HOICE AS

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.729
TO WHAT THEY WANT TO BUY AND

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:41.897
WHETHER THEY WANT TO BUY A NEW

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.899
CAR AND ALL. THAT WE SHOULD TRY

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.534
TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE AND

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:48.137
EASY FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THE

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:50.372
SWITCH INTO INTO THIS ALLEN

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:53.208
MISSION WORLD. IT CAUGHT MY

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:57.046
ATTENTION WE HAD. BUDGET ONE

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:59.648
GREEN AND- DID YOU HEAR F. FOR.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.750
THAT THE- OUR GOVERNOR'S

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:03.819
PROPOSAL FOR SPENDING THE FUNDS

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:06.522
FOR THE- SCV OUR P. HAS BEEN

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:08.323
REDUCED FROM A HUNDRED AND

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:09.958
EIGHTY MILLION TO A HUNDRED AND

01:12:10.025 --> 01:12:11.694
TWENTY MILLION AND THERE'S SOME

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.729
OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS BUT

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.431
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT- A

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:18.734
REDUCTION I. AM I GUESS THE

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.369
SIMPLE THINKING WOULD BE IF YOU

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:22.271
GIVE PEOPLE A TAX CREDIT- YOU

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:24.106
GIVE PEOPLE MONEY TO BUY

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.140
SOMETHING THERE'S MORE

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.276
INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO BUY IT

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:29.745
HOW IT WHAT'S THE- THE

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:32.181
DEPARTMENTS WERE THE AIRPORTS

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.248
THINKING IF WE REDUCE THE

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:35.517
INCENTIVE AS WE KNOW HOW DOES

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:38.320
THAT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT UP I

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:39.822
THINK THE BEST ANSWER TO THAT.

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:42.124
THE POINT IS TO SAY THAT. THIS

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.792
IS A TOPIC THAT NEEDS A BROADER

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.095
DISCUSSION- THAT AS A AS WE

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:47.796
WERE SAYING EARLIER THAT WE

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:49.098
NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OF OUR

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:50.799
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND THE

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.968
MANDATE FOR EXAMS. AND FIGURE

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:54.570
OUT WHAT'S A COMBINATION THAT'S

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:55.938
GOING TO GET US THE FOR THIS

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:58.407
THE FASTEST MAN. OF I THINK

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:01.376
WE'LL HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITIES

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:02.077
TO REVISIT THERE AMOUNTS THOSE

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.246
PROGRAMS WE MOVE ON IN THE

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:06.715
BUDGET. CONVERSATIONS AS WELL.

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:09.118
AS A GUEST SUITE THE QUESTION

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:13.155
IS THAT COSTS BECAUSE I THINK.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.124
YOU FOLKS JUST ISSUED A REPORT

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:17.960
ON OR THE ENERGY. DEPARTMENT H.

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:20.395
ISSUE THE REPORT ON WHAT'S THE

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.931
BENEFIT HOW MANY MISSIONS ARE

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:26.368
WE GOING TO GET REDUCE. IN BY

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:26.969
TWENTY FORTY OR WHATEVER THE

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:28.937
DATE IS IN AN OUR REPORTS IS

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:31.140
NEARLY. THREE BILLION I DON'T

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:32.608
KNOW IF IT'S THREE BILLION BUT

01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:34.476
WHERE ARE WHERE THE WHERE THAT

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:36.545
NUMBER CAME FROM BUT- CAN YOU

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:39.114
TALK ABOUT THE COST. OF THE C.

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.917
V. R. P. PROGRAM WE YOU KNOW WE

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:43.952
TALK ABOUT THE METRIC TONS WHAT

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:45.921
IS A COSTS IS FOR THE DOLLARS

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:48.323
THAT WE SPEND ON. ON THAT

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:50.459
PROGRAM IS IT ECONOMICAL OR IS

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:51.293
IT THE BEST PROGRAM WE'RE

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.929
TALKING ABOUT. REDUCING

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.497
SECTOR SO I KNOW THE LIMITED

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:59.234
THE CHARGE BUT I HAVE A NUMBER.

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:00.536
I THINK IT SHOULD YOUR NUMBER

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:03.038
OR THAT THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.339
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE.

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:07.776
DOLLARS PER METRIC TONS.

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:10.679
THROUGH THE C. C. R. P. PROGRAM

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:15.017
THAT SEEMS HIGH. OF WELL FIRST

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:15.651
OF ALL I GUESS ISHOULD SAY

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:18.687
THAT UNDER- AB THIRTY TWO WHICH

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:20.055
IS WHAT STARTED US DOWN THE

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:22.591
PATH TOWARDS DOING- GREENHOUSE

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:26.195
GAS REDUCTION PROGRAM THOSE

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:27.663
EMISSIONS STANDARDS THAT WERE

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:28.931
IN THE ORIGINAL POWERFULLY

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:32.734
LEGISLATION. AB FOURTEEN NINETY

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.303
THREE I BELIEVE IT WAS-

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:35.871
REQUIRED THAT WE SAT AND

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.339
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:39.741
STANDARDS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:42.711
OVERALL AND THAT MOVED US INTO

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:45.180
CHANGING THESE HAVE MANDATE

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:47.115
WHICH IS REALLY ONLY FOCUSED ON

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:49.017
CONVENTIONAL AIR POLLUTANTS

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:50.352
INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS FOCUSED

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:53.255
ON GREENHOUSE GASES AS WELL AND

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.657
THAT BECAME KIND OF THE CORE OF

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:58.527
THE WHOLE SCOPING PLAN THAT WE

01:14:58.594 --> 01:14:59.995
NOW HAVE AN EFFECT FOR

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:03.866
ACHIEVING OUR CLIMATE GOALS SO-

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:07.035
THAT PROGRAM IS SET IN THE LAWN

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:09.404
NOW AND- IF WE WERE TO LOSE

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:12.407
THAT. OR CHANGE IT WE'D HAVE TO

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:14.009
GO BACK TO GROUND ZERO IN TERMS

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:15.344
OF HOW WE'RE MEETING OUR

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:17.913
OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.783
OBJECTIVES THE MANDATE ON A RP

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.485
BUT TO TRY TO DEVELOP A COST

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:25.220
EFFECTIVE PROGRAM I MEAN WE

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:27.789
WERE REQUIRED TO DO THAT AND SO

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.591
WHAT WE DID WAS TO COME UP WITH

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:32.728
SOMETHING THAT IS A MIX OF. AYE

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:34.096
AYE CAPTAIN PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:37.566
AND THE OF DIFFERENT. MATT

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:38.700
ELEMENTS IN GETTING THE

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:40.502
GREENHOUSE GAS PIPE TYPE

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:41.637
EMISSIONS STAND. AND PUT THAT

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:45.274
TOGETHER SO THAT THE NET OF

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.542
THAT SHOULD BE A MOST. COST

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:49.511
EFFECTIVE WAY OF ACHIEVING THE

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:51.446
OVERALL GOAL AND WE'VE HAD THAT

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.148
LOOKED AT SEVERAL TIMES BY

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:56.985
OUTSIDE ECONOMISTS WHO HAVE

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:58.220
INDICATED THAT THEY THOUGHT.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:15:59.588
THAT KIND OF A NAY PROUD WHICH

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.723
WAS FACT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:03.959
SOME INCENTIVE SOME MANDATES

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:06.328
DIFFERENT SECTOR APPROACH TAKEN

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.764
TOGETHER MAKE SENSE OF THE

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:11.066
EXPENSE THE COST AS- AS

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:13.268
EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO GET

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:14.970
TO THE TO GET TO THE GOAL. TO

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:16.772
WHAT YOUR MODELING NOW ARE

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:17.773
WHERE THEY ARE MODELING THAT

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:20.809
USE BETWEEN D. V. PURCHASES IN

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:25.213
THE- PRICE OF GASOLINE BECAUSE

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:25.847
ONCE UPON A TIME YOU KNOW I'M-

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.182
HAVEN'T HAVEN'T BEEN QUIET

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:28.617
ABOUT WHERE I THINK THE PRICE

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:30.452
OF GASOLINE SHE GO TO BUT- BUT

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:31.887
YOU MUST HAVE SOME MODELING AT

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:33.455
THE AIRPORT AND-

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:34.556

NOW AND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:55.344
THE AIRPORT HAS ON THE- PEOPLE

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.045
WHEN THE PEOPLE SWITCH OVER. IN

REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:37.472
RELEASED. A LITTLE MORE THAN A

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:39.808
YEAR AGO- WHERE WE- ASSESS THE

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:41.510
STATE'S POLICIES THE MAJOR

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:46.014
POLICIES IN THE. TRANSPORTATION

AREA THE SERGEANTS TO BE IN AN

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:48.884
OUT HAND OUT WHICH TRY TO

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:49.751
SUMMARIZE SOME OF THOSE POINTS

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.119
I'LL BE ONE THROUGH TODAY. I

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.621
JUST FOR CONTACTS SO THAT

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:54.356
REPORT WAS DONE IN RESPONSE TO

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:55.223
THERE IS A STATUTORY

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.925
REQUIREMENT THAT OUR OFFICE.

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.693
REVIEW THE ECONOMIC AND TAX AND

01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.995
BENEFITS OF THE STATE'S

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:00.862
GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS

01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:02.998
ANNUALLY. AND SO THE APPROACH

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.366
WE'VE TAKEN IS TRY TO LOOK AT

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:05.867
DIFFERENT SECTORS AND KIND OF

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.202
POLICIES IN THOSE SECTORS. AND

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:08.870
TRY TO LOOK AT THE AVAILABLE

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:10.438
DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:12.574
WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT THOSE

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:13.141
POLICIES HAVE ACHIEVED BOTH

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:14.643
GOOD AND BAD. AND WHERE THERE

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:15.810
GAPS IN INFORMATION SO IT'S

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:17.212
LARGELY A- KIND OF

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:18.880
RETROSPECTIVE VIEW ON KIND OF

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:21.116
WHAT WE WHAT WE ACHIEVED SO FAR

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:22.384
WHICH WE HOPE IS KIND OF

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:23.218
INFORMATIVE FOR YOU AS YOU SORT

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:25.820
OF THINK ABOUT YOUR- YOUR GOALS

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.355
GOING FORWARD. SO IF YOU TURN

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:29.024
TO THE HAND OUT I'LL WE'VE

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:30.058
TOUCHED ON SOME OF THIS

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:31.326
INFORMATION ALREADY SO TRY TO

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.094
MOVE THROUGH IT FAIRLY QUICKLY

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:33.695
AND OF COURSE HAVE AN ANSWER

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:36.198
QUESTIONS. PAGE ONE OF THE HAND

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:37.832
OUT TO STANDING GIVES YOU. SOME

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:39.501
HIGH LEVEL CONTACTS FOR THE

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:41.570
STATE'S REENHOUSE GAS SCHOOLS-

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:43.371
ESTABLISH MAY BE THIRTY TWO AND

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:46.641
SB THIRTY TWO. AS YOU KNOW WE-

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:48.443
HAVE KIND OF HIT THAT- TWENTY

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.411
TWENTY TARGET A FEW YEARS

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:51.046
EARLY. I THINK ONE OF THE KEY

01:20:51.112 --> 01:20:52.414
TAKEAWAYS FROM THE CHART ON

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.217
PAGE ONE IS THAT THE- TWENTY

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:56.318
THIRTY GOAL IS YOU KNOW IS MUCH

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:58.520
MORE AMBITIOUS THAN. TWENTY

01:20:58.587 --> 01:20:59.287
TWENTY GOAL IN TERMS OF KIND OF

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:01.089
ANNUAL REDUCTIONS REQUIRED TO

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:02.390
MEET THAT TARGET- JUST FOR

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:04.025
CONTEXT THE KIND OF ANNUAL

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.360
REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET THE

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:06.228
TWENTY TWENTY TARGET WERE.

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:09.331
ROUGHLY 1% PER YEAR. OR AS THE

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:10.298
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET IS CLOSER

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:13.368
24% PER YEAR SO THAT GIVES YOU-KIND OF A SENSE OF THE- LEVEL

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.937
OF AMBITION ASSOCIATED WITH

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:17.739
THAT. TWENTY THIRTY. TURNING TO

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:20.475
PAGE TWO. OF THE HAND OUT-

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:21.243
DISTILLING DOWN A LITTLE BIT

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:23.578
MORE ON KIND OF WHERE WE'VE

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:24.779
SEEN EMISSIONS GO OVER THE

01:21:24.846 --> 01:21:27.616
LAST. COUPLE OF DECADES. BROKEN

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:30.218
OUT BY DIFFERENT SECTORS- I

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:31.620
THINK THE MAIN STORY HERE IS

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:32.787
THAT IT'S REALLY BEEN THE

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:34.022
ELECTRICITY SECTOR THAT HAS

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:35.890
BEEN THE DRIVER OF ALMOST ALL.

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:37.092
OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS WE

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:38.827
SEEN OVER THE LAST. DECADE OR

01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:42.397
SO YOU CAN SEE. THE KIND OF

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:44.199
THAT THE- LEFT SIDE OF THAT

01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:45.800
CHART THE SECOND HIGHEST LINE

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.535
IS KIND OF THE ELECTRICITY. ON

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:50.171
MISSIONS- AND ABOUT A DECADE

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.340
AGO YOU SAW THOSE- MISSIONS

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.609
DECLINED RATHER RAPIDLY-

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:56.011
LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGE

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:58.046
IN THE MIX OF. A GENERATION

01:21:58.113 --> 01:21:59.614
RESOURCES WE USE TO POWER

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:01.950
ELECTRICITY GRID- ON THE OTHER

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:03.251
HAND A LOT OF THE OTHER SECTORS

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.287
HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY FLAT AND

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:06.855
YOU CAN SEE THE- TOP LINE THERE

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:08.256
ARE TRANSPORTATION THE MAJOR

01:22:08.323 --> 01:22:10.025
SOURCE OF- BECAUSE- A SINGLE

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:14.496
SOURCE OF EMISSIONS- DECLINE

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:15.130
FOR A WHILE. AROUND THE TIME OF

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:16.765
CRASH. RISK WITHIN IS S. AN

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:18.066
UPTICK OR LOSS OF YEARS SOON AS

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:23.405
YOU KNOW. SO TURN INTO PAGE

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:25.874
THREE. OF THE HAND OUT- I

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:26.908
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:29.277
JUST LAY OUT NEAR THE POLICIES

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:30.512
THAT WE TRIED TO LOOK AT AS

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:31.913
PART OF OUR REPORT AND JUST

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.114
PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT OF ALL THE

01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:34.182
DIFFERENT POLICIES THAT THE

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.618
STATE HAS- IN DIFFERENT AREAS

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:37.819
TRYING TO ACHIEVE OR ARE

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:39.854
GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS IN

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:40.689
TRANSPORTATION. SO WE DIVIDED

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.390
ON INTO FOUR DIFFERENT

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:44.225
CATEGORIES- THE LIGHT DUTY

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:46.227
VEHICLE PROGRAMS- I'M NOT GONNA

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.662
GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:49.898
ESSENTIALLY THERE'S- A MIX OF A

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:51.866
LOT OF DIFFERENT- POLICIES HERE

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:54.069
SO WE HAVE REBATES FOR ELECTRIC

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:56.771
VEHICLES AS YOU DISCUSSED- HV

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:59.574
STICKERS- WE HAVE REGULATIONS

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:02.310
HICH ALSO A MENISCUS- CHARGING

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:06.081
INFRASTRUCTURE. IN A PUBLIC

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:07.482
FUNDING FOR ELECTRIC CHARGING

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:11.019
IN IS ALSO A BIG OF THIS ON THE

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:12.654
HEAVY DUTY SIDE AND WE FOCUS

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:13.722
MOSTLY ON THE INCENTIVES THERE

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:14.989
ARE SOME REGULATIONS IN HEAVY

01:23:15.056 --> 01:23:17.592
DUTY SECTOR BUT- OUR ANALYSIS

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.494
WAS MAINLY IN THE- THE

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.862
INCENTIVE SIDE OF THINGS. EVEN

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.564
WITHIN THAT THERE IS STILL A

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:23.998
DIFFERENT FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:27.135
WE HAVE AND THEY CAN FOCUS ON

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:29.204
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF KIND OF

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.904
THE HEAVY DUTY CHALLENGE SO

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.573
SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:32.107
PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:34.142
TRYING TO PROMOTE A NEW

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:35.944
TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING THOSE

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.046
NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PILOTING

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:39.314
THOSE. THE ARE MORE FOCUSSED

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:41.282
KIND OF PLANE MORE WELL

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:42.684
DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES AND KIND

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:44.419
OF EARLY- COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENT

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:47.856
STAGE THROUGH- VOUCHERS- THEIR

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:49.157
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE FOCUSED

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.392
MORE ON LOCAL AIR POLLUTION

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:52.360
REDUCTIONS I LIKE THE CAR WHERE

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:54.329
PROGRAM A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:56.698
FUNDING- AND THEN. AGAIN IN THE

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.400
HEAVY DUTY SPACE THERE'S- A

01:23:58.466 --> 01:23:59.234
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.404
RELATED TO- TO TRUCK CHARGING

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.004
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HEAVY DUTY

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:04.806
VEHICLES. AND FINALLY LAST TWO

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.374
CATEGORIES LOW CARBON FUELS IS

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:07.509
A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:10.612
WHICH IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED.

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:12.514
AND THEN SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE.

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.949
SO REAL QUICK- JUST WANNA KINDA

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:17.051
HIT THE HIGH POINTS ON FOR EACH

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:18.353
OF THESE CATEGORIES WHAT KIND

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.687
OF OUR MAIN TAKEAWAYS WERE

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:21.423
AFTER HAVING TRIED TO REVIEW

01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:23.825
ALL THE- AVAILABLE INFORMATION-

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:25.126
FOR THE LIGHT DUTY PROGRAMS I

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:26.327
THINK. KIND AND FRANKLY THE

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:27.562
MAIN TAKEAWAY IS THAT THE

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:28.997
MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECTS OF ALL

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:31.499
THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- WAS

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:34.402
LARGELY ON CLEAR- AND I THINK

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:35.837
THAT'S YOU KNOW IN LARGE PART

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.605
DUE TO JUST THE WIDE VARIETY OF

01:24:37.672 --> 01:24:39.808
PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN THAT AREA

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.876
AND WE DO THINGS- YOU KNOW EVEN

01:24:41.943 --> 01:24:42.477
THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:43.912
EMISSIONS OF PICKED UP OVER THE

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.346
LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE DO THINK

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:46.648
THAT. THESE PROGRAMS ARE HAVING

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:49.551
SOME- AFFECTS OF KIND OF

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:50.952
REDUCING EMISSIONS ASSIST

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:52.053
RELATIVE TO WHERE THEY WOULD

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.621
HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN BUT TRYING

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:55.390
TO TEASE OUT. BASICALLY WHAT IS

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:57.926
THE EFFECT OF OUR REGULATIONS

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:59.661
VERSES ARE INCENTIVES VERSUS

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:01.830
OUR FUNDING FOR ELECTRIC

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.731
VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:04.265
INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING AND

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.600
THERE HASN'T FRANKLY THAN A LOT

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.535
OF- CREE WORK IT'S AVAILABLE TO

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.938
COUNTER. TRYING TO GET ANSWER

01:25:10.004 --> 01:25:13.641
TO THAT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:16.344
FIVE- MOHAMMED ON TO THE HEAVY

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.880
DUTY VEHICLE PIECE OF IT- AND

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:19.981
THAT KIND OF MAIN TAKEAWAYS

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:23.751
THERE. ARE THE- WHEN YOU LOOK

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:24.819
AT SOME OF THE ESTIMATES THAT

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:25.887
HAVE PRODUCED BEEN PRODUCED BY

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:28.022
THEIR BOARD AROUND THE GHG

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:28.923
EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM THOSE

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:32.193
PROGRAMS. THEY ARE- GENERALLY

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.595
MUCH MORE COSTLY THAN SOME OF

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:35.463
THE OTHER POLICIES WE HAVE SO.

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:36.764
ON AVERAGE WE LOOKED AT IT WAS

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:38.266
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:40.168
TON FORTY EIGHT SHE'S. A

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:42.504
RANGING FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:43.104
TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:44.706
TON. AND COMPARING THAT TO

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:46.774
pPROGRAMS WE HAVE CAP AND TRADE

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:48.877
ALLOWANCE PRICES FOR CONTEXT OF

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:50.912
SEVENTEEN DOLLARS PER TON- WE

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.114
RECENTLY REVIEWED SOME- POLICY

01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:54.983
THING ELECTRICITY SECTOR- THE

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:56.084
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:58.586
WHICH RUN THE RANGE OF SIXTY TO

01:25:58.653 --> 01:25:59.254
SEVENTY DOLLARS PER TON SO THAT

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.055
CAN SEE A- A BIT OF CONTEXT FOR

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:03.958
THAT NUMBER- BUT I. ALSO THINK

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:05.093
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KIND OF KEEP

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:06.327
IN MIND THAT SOME OF THE GOALS

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:07.662
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.697
GO BEYOND JUST SORT OF- NEAR

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.232
TERM COST EFFECTIVE EMISSION

01:26:11.299 --> 01:26:12.300
REDUCTIONS AND THAT'S AN

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:13.401
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:14.602
KIND OF WAY IN THE TRADE OFFS

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:16.337
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS.

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:18.206
SO FOR EXAMPLE SUPPORT IN EARLY

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:19.474
STAGE TECHNOLOGIES WE THINK

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:21.809
THERE COULD BE. A VERY KIND OF

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:24.112
APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE STATE

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:25.313
THERE AND KIND OF- PROMOTING

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.381
KNOWLEDGE BILL OVERTON

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:27.882
PROMOTING TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:29.551
MAYBE THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WOULD

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:31.986
PROVIDE ON ITS OWN- AS WELL AS

01:26:32.053 --> 01:26:32.854
SOME OF THE LOCAL AIR QUALITY

01:26:32.921 --> 01:26:34.355
BENEFITS YOU CAN GET FROM A LOT

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:35.256
OF THESE PROGRAMS A LOT OF THIS

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:36.958
PROGRAM AS I MENTIONED. ARE

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.293
KIND OF TRYING TO TACKLE SOME

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:40.228
OF THOSE. MORE LOCAL AIR

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:41.563
QUALITY CHALLENGES AND HEAVY

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:43.531
DUTY VEHICLES ARE. THE MAJOR

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.733
CONTRIBUTOR TO- TO THOSE

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.502
CHALLENGES AND SO. ON WHEN THE

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:48.469
KIND OF THINKING ABOUT KIND OF

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:49.470
THE OVERALL BENEFITS AND COSTS

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:51.205
OF THESE PROGRAMS IT'S- AN RV I

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:52.774
THINK KIND OF A MATTER OF. WAY

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.076
IN THOSE RELATIVELY HIGH KIND

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:55.643
OF NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:56.878
REDUCTION COSTS WITH SOME OF

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.613
THOSE OTHER BENEFITS THAT YOU.

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:05.853
CAN SEE. FROM THESE PROGRAMS.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.524
FUEL STANDARD WHICH IS

01:27:09.591 --> 01:27:11.492
ESSENTIALLY A KIND OF PROGRAM

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:14.729
THAT ESSENTIALLY- PENALIZES

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:16.864
RELATIVELY HIGH CARBON FUEL

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:18.866
SUPPLIERS AND YOU KNOW-

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:20.902
SUBSIDIZES RELATIVELY LOW

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:22.570
CARBON FUEL SUPPLIERS THROUGH

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:24.072
THE SYSTEM INCREDIBLE CREDITS

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:26.908
THEIR ESTABLISHED- AND SEE A

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:27.475
BASED ON SOME OF THE

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.510
INFORMATION FROM CARVE IT- THE

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:31.079
PROGRAM THE CARBON INTENSITY OF

01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:33.014
THE TRANSPORTATION FUEL MIX HAS

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:35.416
DECREASED SINCE TWENTY TEN BY

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:38.853
ABOUT. 4% AND I THINK IF YOU

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.722
TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF THE HAND

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:42.824
OUT- ANTHOLOGIZED ON MOVING

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:43.758
THROUGH IT RATHER QUICKLY

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:45.793
BECAUSE AND- YOU WANNA LEAVE

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.195
TIME FOR QUESTIONS BUT I THINK

01:27:47.261 --> 01:27:48.930
THE ONE OF THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:51.432
IS THAT NEW CREDIT PRICES IN

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:53.167
THAT PROGRAM. RIGHT NOW AROUND

01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:55.169
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TON SO

01:27:55.236 --> 01:27:56.838
LESS THAN KIND OF SOME OF THE

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:58.239
COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO THE

01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.941
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS BUT

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:01.075
RELATIVE TO. SOME OF OUR OTHER

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:02.777
PROGRAMS LIKE CAP AND TRADE-

01:28:02.844 --> 01:28:05.346
QUITE A BIT HIGHER- AND AGAIN

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:06.848
AND I THINK WE THINK SORT OF

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:08.049
SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS TO BE

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:09.951
ASKED IN OUR- WHAT ARE SOME OF

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:11.185
THE OTHER BENEFITS THAT YOU'RE

01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:13.121
BEGINNING FROM. THE LCS US

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:14.188
PROGRAM THAT YOU CAN'T GET FROM

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:15.556
SOME OF. SOME OF OUR OTHER

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:17.058
PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT BE A BIT

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.693
MORE COST EFFECTIVE SO FOR

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.561
EXAMPLE. IS THE L. SURFACE KIND

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.563
OF PUSHING INNOVATION IN THIS

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.198
SPACE AND A LOW CARBON FUEL

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:26.034
SPACE OR THE DOING SORT OF A

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.268
YOU KNOW OTHER TYPES OF THINGS

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:28.069
THAT YOU KNOW CARBON PRICING

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:30.805
FOR EXAMPLE LONG CAN. CAN

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:35.743
ACCOMPLISH. PAGE EIGHT- HAS

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.912
JUST SOME COMMENTS ON SB THREE

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.113
SEVENTY FIVE. SELECT THERE'S

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.516
BEEN. QUITE A ROBUST DISCUSSION

01:28:41.582 --> 01:28:44.419
AROUND THAT- THAT- PIECE OF THE

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:46.020
PUZZLE SO FAR I THINK OUR

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:47.021
FINDINGS KIND OF REFLECT A LOT

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:48.690
OF THE- THE DISCUSSION THAT'S

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:50.224
HAPPENED SO FAR THAT THAT YOU

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:50.725
KNOW THOSE VEHICLE MILES

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.627
TRAVELED. ARE TARGETS OF NOT

01:28:52.694 --> 01:28:54.462
REALLY BEEN MET AND THERE'S-

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:57.031
YOU KNOW THAT'S A TOUGH ISSUE.

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.633
SO IF IT I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO.

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.836
PAGE NINE- WHERE I'M GONNA

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:02.704
HOPEFULLY TRY TO KIND OF WRAP

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:05.873
UP- YOU KNOW THE- THE WIDE

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:07.008
VARIETY OF COMMENTS RELATED ALL

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:08.242
THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:09.977
KIND OF. SYNTHESIZE BUT WE

01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:10.611
THINK ARE KIND OF THE KEY TAKE

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:13.514
AWAYS- FIRST AS ANY OF THE

01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:15.349
OVERALL MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:16.584
IMPACTS OF THE POLICIES IN MANY

01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:17.685
CASES NOT IN ALL THEIR SOME

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:18.186
GOOD INFORMATION BUT THE

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:20.188
OVERALL MAGNITUDE. OF THE A IN

01:29:20.254 --> 01:29:21.355
TAXES SOME OF THESE POLICIES IS

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:24.459
UNCLEAR- I THINK THAT WE THINK

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:25.226
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

01:29:25.293 --> 01:29:26.360
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:28.830
INTO. WHEN THESE POLICIES AND

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:30.398
REGULATIONS ARE DEVELOPED- UP

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:31.766
FRONT WHAT KIND OF THE

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:33.301
ESTIMATED IMPACTS OF THOSE WILL

01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:36.337
BE- THERE'S RELATIVELY LITTLE

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:37.939
WORK. AND KIND OF STRUCTURE IN

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:39.474
PLACE FOR ABOUT A WOOD IN AFTER

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.775
THE FACT AFTER THE PROGRAMS

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:42.677
HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. WHAT WE

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:44.112
KNOW SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE

01:29:44.178 --> 01:29:46.547
LINE ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:47.315
ACCOMPLISHED AND SO. YOU KNOW

01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:48.316
IT THAT THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:49.484
CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:50.818
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE LARGE

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:51.986
NUMBER OF PROGRAMS IN TRYING

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:54.388
TO. TEASE OUT EXACTLY WHICH ONE

01:29:54.455 --> 01:29:56.791
IS DOING HOW MUCH AND WHAT- BUT

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.993
WE DO THINK- OUR RECOMMENDATION

01:29:59.060 --> 01:29:59.727
IS THAT THE LOS LEGISLATURE

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:01.162
THINK ABOUT WAYS TO KIND OF

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:03.564
ESTABLISH A MORE. ROBUST SYSTEM

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:05.066
FOR EVALUATING. THE EFFECTS OF

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:06.534
THE POLICIES AFTER THEY'VE BEEN

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:07.101
IMPLEMENTED SO YOU CAN HAVE

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:09.303
THAT INFORMATION. FOR POTENTIAL

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:11.239
MODIFICATIONS GOING FORWARD.

01:30:11.305 --> 01:30:14.642
THE SECOND MAIN POINT- IS THAT.

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:15.643
BASED ON OUR REVIEW IN THE

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.278
INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE SO

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:18.946
FAR- THE POLICIES AND

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:19.614
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.916
RELATIVELY. COSTLY COMPARED TO

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:25.620
SOME OF OUR- OTHER POLICIES-

01:30:25.686 --> 01:30:27.321
AND SO WE DO RECOMMEND SNOW

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:29.423
FOCUSING TRYING TO FOCUS ON OUR

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:30.691
MOST COST EFFECTIVE POLICIES WE

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.160
THINK IN OUR- IN OUR RECAPPING.

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:34.295
TRADE AND JUST ECONOMY WIDE

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:35.429
CARBON PRICING IN GENERAL IS

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:37.532
THE MOST. COST EFFECTIVE

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:40.701
APPROACH- AND WE THINK NO COST

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:41.435
EFFECTIVENESS BECOMES EVEN MORE

01:30:41.502 --> 01:30:44.005
IMPORTANT AS THE GOALS BECOME

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:45.139
MORE AMBITIOUS HANDS. ON SOME

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:46.841
OF THE WILL AND IN FOR. TARGET

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:49.010
TAKEN AND SO TRYING- YOU. PLACE

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:50.845
EVEN A GREATER EMPHASIS ON COST

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:51.546
EFFECTIVENESS MAKES A LOT OF

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:56.284
SENSE- WITH THAT SAID THERE ARE

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:59.487
SOME. VERY GOOD REASONS TO

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:00.555
IMPLEMENT SOME COMPLIMENTARY

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:02.290
POLICIES WHERE THEY MAKE SENSE

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:04.325
AND SO- I THINK OUR- OUR

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:05.660
SUGGESTION IS JUST KIND OF

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:07.662
THINK ABOUT- WHAT ARE THE OTHER

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:08.830
GOALS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:31:08.896 --> 01:31:09.497
ACHIEVE WITH SOME OF THESE

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:10.932
OTHER POLICIES THAT. MIGHT BE

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:12.600
MORE COSTLY ON ON A KIND OF

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:14.168
NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS BASIS

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:16.003
BUT- THEY'RE STILL A STRONG

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:19.040
RATIONALE FOR. THE STATE TO

01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:20.041
INTERVENE IN AND ADOPT AN

01:31:20.107 --> 01:31:21.475
ADDITIONAL POLICY IN THAT AREA

01:31:21.542 --> 01:31:23.311
SO TWO. EXAMPLES THAT I

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:24.812
MENTIONED ARE KIND OF IN THE

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:25.880
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPACE

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:28.015
AND PUSHING TECHNOLOGIES WHERE

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:29.650
EVEN IF THERE IS A HIGHER

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:32.253
CARBON PRICE IT MIGHT NOT- YOU

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.421
KNOW IN. THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:34.989
MIGHT NOT KIND OF THE DOCTORS

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:36.157
TECHNOLOGIES DUE TO A VARIETY

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:38.593
OF OTHER FACTORS- AND THEN

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:40.428
FOCUSING ON LOCAL AIR POLLUTION

01:31:40.494 --> 01:31:41.295
THERE MIGHT BE. KIND OF AGAIN

01:31:41.362 --> 01:31:43.564
YOU KNOW VERY- SIGNIFICANT

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:44.665
BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:45.600
REDUCTIONS AND LOCAL AIR

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:47.368
POLLUTION BEYOND SORT OF THE

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:48.936
GREENHOUSE GAS SPACE AND SO

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:49.503
THERE MIGHT BE A VERY GOOD

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:50.571
REASON TO. TO BE PUT ON

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:55.343
SOMEBODY'S POLICY AND THEN THE-

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:58.546
COMMENT I GUESS I JUST US. BACK

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:00.214
A LITTLE BIT IS AS YOU'RE

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.415
THINKING ABOUT KIND OF THE

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:01.983
APPROPRIATE MIX OF POLICIES

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:04.018
GOING FORWARD. THINK ABOUT

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:06.254
WHICH POLICIES ARE. NOT LIKELY

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:06.821
TO ENCOURAGE EMISSION

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.222
REDUCTIONS IN OTHER

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:10.124
JURISDICTIONS GIVEN THE GLOBAL

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:11.459
NATURE OF THIS PROBLEM.

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.427
CALIFORNIA BEING A MALE ABOUT

01:32:13.494 --> 01:32:15.162
1% OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:16.664
EMISSIONS. THING ABOUT WHERE

01:32:16.731 --> 01:32:17.765
OUR POLICIES MAKING A

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:19.600
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE EVEN

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:20.701
OUTSIDE OF THE BORDER IF KIND

01:32:20.768 --> 01:32:23.004
OF THE PRIMARY TARGET HERE IS

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:24.538
SORT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:25.640
IN ADDRESSING THAT AND- THAT

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:27.008
COULD MEAN THINKING ABOUT IT IN

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:28.476
A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS ONE.

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:29.844
OUR POLICIES SERVING AS

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:31.212
AFFECTED DEMONSTRATIONS TO

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:32.680
OTHER JURISDICTIONS SORE OTHER

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:33.748
JURISDICTIONS KIND OF LOOKING

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:35.549
TO CALIFORNIA AND- AND LIKELY

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:37.051
TO KIND OF A TOP SOME OF THE

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:37.652
POLICIES THAT WERE TESTING OUT

01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:40.087
HERE- AND THEN THE OTHER IS

01:32:40.154 --> 01:32:41.756
THINKING ABOUT IT ON A- FROM A

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:43.524
TECHNOLOGICAL LENDS OUR OUR

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:46.294
POLICIES PUSHING. TECHNOLOGIES

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:49.196
THAT- IF THEY BECOME CHEAPER

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:50.665
AND MORE ACCESSIBLE ARE LIKELY

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:51.866
TO BE ADOPTED IN OTHER

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:53.301
JURISDICTIONS AND SO THAT. HAS

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:54.735
THE POTENTIAL TO KIND OF HIM

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:55.937
MAXIMIZE AND KIND OF INCREASE

01:32:56.003 --> 01:32:57.605
THE OVERALL EFFECT THAT THE-

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:59.173
THE STATE'S POLICIES HAVE HERE

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.142
BEYOND JUST CALIFORNIA BORDERS

01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:03.477
SO- THAT. TRIED TO COVER A LOT

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:04.879
OF MATERIAL- PRETTY QUICKLY

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:08.616
THEIR SON HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:10.051
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON. I VERY

01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:11.185
MUCH APPRECIATE ALL YOUR

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:13.554
COMMENTS- I WILL. ALSO WONDERED

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:15.122
DID THE FOLKS FROM CARVE WANNA

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:16.057
HELP PARTICIPATE IN THIS

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:18.726
DISCUSSION- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:23.164
YOU KNOW. YOUR AGENCIES. MEMBER

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:26.567

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:27.168
SAID TO LEAVE BUT IF YOU GUYS

WANNA. BE HERE FOR THE

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:34.175
DISCUSSION. DO YOU DO YOU WANT

01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:35.910
TO MAKE ANY KIND OF REACT A

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:37.578
GOOD INITIAL REACTION BEFORE WE

01:33:37.645 --> 01:33:40.948
OPEN UP TO THE SENATORS ARE. M.

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:42.316
GOOD MORNING AT SENATORS

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:44.118
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CHAIRS. I

01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:45.119
REGION- SO HEAD OF THE

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:47.788
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD AND-

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:48.889
MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT ROSS

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.358
MADE WE ACTUALLY VERY MUCH

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:52.293
AGREE WITH. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.295
THINK ABOUT THE OTHER FACTORS

01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:55.796
FOR THESE PROGRAMS MANY OF THE

01:33:55.863 --> 01:33:57.865
PROGRAMS THAT ARE CALLED FOR IN

01:33:57.932 --> 01:33:59.467
THE REPORT FOR LA YOU. ARE

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:00.368
ACTUALLY PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:03.037
SCOPING PLAN FOR TWO THOUSAND

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:03.671
SEVENTEEN TO ACHIEVE OUR TWENTY

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:04.672
THIRTY TARGET. WHEN WE DEVELOP

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:06.607
THAT SCOPING PLAN WE WENT BACK

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:07.441
AND LOOKED AT MANY OF THE

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:09.176
EXISTING PROGRAMS TO SEE IF WE

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:10.344
COULD LEVERAGE THOSE EXISTING

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:12.613
AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS FOR THEIR

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.581
CO BENEFITS FOR GREENHOUSE

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:15.916
GASES. WHAT WE REALIZED WAS WAS

01:34:15.983 --> 01:34:17.385
THAT BECAUSE OF THE FDERAL

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:18.052
MANDATES FOR STATE

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:19.487
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS ARE

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:20.588
REGIONAL AIR QUALITY

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:21.922
IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:23.824
TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH WE HAD

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:25.259
IN A- TOOL KIT OF

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:27.061
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ORDER

01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:28.496
IN PLACE THAT WE COULD LEVERAGE

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:30.831
FOR THE SCOPING PLAN. SO THE

01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:33.968
pPROGRAMS. IS ACTUALLY AIR

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:35.603
QUALITY WE'RE LEVERAGING THE CO

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:37.772
BENEFITS AND SO WHEN WE GO BACK

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:38.873
AND LOOK AT THOSE WITH GIGI

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:40.441
LANDS WE'RE NOT SEEING THE

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:42.243
COMPLETE PICTURE. AND MISTER

01:34:42.309 --> 01:34:44.378
BROWN FROM LA- ACTUALLY SPOKE

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:45.012
TO THAT THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:47.281
THE BROADER PICTURE. AND SO IF

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:48.449
WE WENT BACK TO THE SCOPING

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:50.184
PLAN AND WE PULLED OUT SOME OF

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:51.552
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WE SAID WE

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:52.553
DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SCOPING

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.755
PLANET JUST THINK ABOUT- DO WE

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:56.590
NEED THESE PROGRAMS AT ALL. WE

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:57.825
WOULD SAY YES BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:34:57.892 --> 01:34:59.860
NECESSARY FOR AIR QUALITY

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:01.595
TARGETS AND GOALS. PROGRAMS

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:03.431
LIKE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD.

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:04.632
ARE ACTUALLY DISPLACING ABOUT

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:06.500
TWO POINT THREE BILLION GALLONS

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:08.803
OF DIESEL. FUEL EVERY YEAR IN

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:09.336
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEY

01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:11.806
REFUSE KNOCKS BY ABOUT SIX

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:12.973
HUNDRED TONS ACROSS THE STATE.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.277
AND SO. TO READ ABOUT AIR

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:17.578
QUALITY FIRST. AND THEY TO LIVE

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:23.818
CO BENNETT U. G. SO. OKAY WELL.

01:35:23.884 --> 01:35:25.219
ALRIGHT I KNOW WHO TO A CATCH

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:26.987
YOU CAN HAVE SOM QUESTIONS

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:32.159
HERE THIS. WE ALWAYS STRUGGLE

WILL WORK ON IT I'M IN FOR A

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:23.777
FRACTION OF THE COST OF THAT

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:25.479
WE'RE PAYING FOR THERE ARE

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:27.815
VEHICLE PROGRAM HOW DO I

01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:29.383
BALANCE THAT YOU KNOW BESIDES

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.451
BALANCING THESE OTHERS

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:32.353
EXTERNALITIES HOW DO I LOOK AT

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:33.988
I GET LIMITED FUNDS WORK THE

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:40.294
MONEY IS. SHRINKING. YEAH I

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:41.929
MEAN IT'S A TOUGH BALANCE AND

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:43.531
AN EIGHT TO BE QUITE FRANK I'M

01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:44.565
NOT SURE THAT I CAN KIND OF

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.367
GIVE YOU AN EXACT ANSWER OF

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:47.868
KIND OF EXACTLY HOW TO WEIGH

01:36:47.935 --> 01:36:48.869
THOSE THINGS BUT I THINK YOU'VE

01:36:48.936 --> 01:36:50.538
KIND OF HIT THE NAIL ON THE

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:52.339
HEAD ON. HOW WE THINK YOU

01:36:52.406 --> 01:36:53.007
SHOULD BE KIND OF THINKING

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:54.341
ABOUT TRYING TO PRIORITIZE

01:36:54.408 --> 01:36:56.544
THESE DIFFERENT FUNDS I MEAN IN

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:57.144
ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:58.846
LOOK AT. YOU KNOW PURELY ON

01:36:58.913 --> 01:37:00.848
KIND OF YOU KNOW NEAR OR MID

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:02.883
TERM- ANNOUCEMENT OPTIONS

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:03.918
WITHIN THE STATE WHAT'S THE

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:06.020
MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO

01:37:06.086 --> 01:37:06.887
ACHIEVE THOSE REDUCTIONS AND-

01:37:06.954 --> 01:37:08.155
SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS MIGHT

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:10.124
SCORE OUT PRETTY WELL BASED ON

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:12.159
THAT METRIC AND IF THAT'S- THE

01:37:12.226 --> 01:37:13.928
PRIMARY GOAL- THEN YOU'RE

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:14.762
FOCUSING RESOURCES AND

01:37:14.828 --> 01:37:16.363
PRIORITIZING RESOURCES IN THAT

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:17.631
AREA. I THINK YOU MENTIONED

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:19.266
SOME OF THE BAG AND MATH PIECE

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.168
DOES THOSE ARE PIECES THAT KIND

01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:23.938
OF CONCERT FALL OUTSIDE OF. THE

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:25.139
KIND OF SCOPE OF THE CAP AND

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:26.874
TRADE PROGRAM AS WELL AND SO WE

01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:28.275
THINK THAT'S KIND OF ANOTHER

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:29.643
REASON TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:32.146
FOCUSING ON- RESOURCES AND

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:34.515
FUNDING IN THAT. KIND OF ON IT

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:36.183
IS THAT MAYBE I TARGETED BY. OR

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:36.984
COVERED BY THE CAPTAIN TRADE

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:39.253
PRO. BUT IT IS THIS BALANCE OF

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.223
CAN ABOUT WELL. THERE ARE

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:43.924

01:43:00.707 --> 01:43:02.709
EUROPEANS ARE DOING AS HAVE

01:43:02.776 --> 01:43:04.411
THEY'RE HAVING THEIR OPTIONS AT

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:06.680
THIRTY DOLLARS- PER METRIC TON

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:07.881
IN WHAT THE WORLD BANK HAS

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:09.249
SUGGESTED THAT THAT THE PRICE

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:11.151
OF CARBON ARE ALLOWING SHE

01:43:11.218 --> 01:43:12.886
SHOULD BE FORTY TO EIGHTY I

01:43:12.953 --> 01:43:15.522
MEAN WE'VE GONE FROM SEVENTEEN

01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:16.790
TO EIGHTEEN IN THIS THIS TODAY

01:43:16.857 --> 01:43:19.326
TODAY'S AUCTION OR LAST WEEK'S

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:22.329
AUCTION- IS THAT IS IN THERE

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:24.431
MORE INCENTIVE THAT THE AIRPORT

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.833
COULD DO OUR OR SIGNALS TO THE

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.602
MARKET ABOUT WHERE WE WANT TO

01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:32.239
SEE PRICES IN. IN FOUR YEARS

01:43:32.306 --> 01:43:34.308
BECAUSE IF WE GO 5% PER YEAR

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:41.114
PER YEAR THAT'S WAS AT.

01:43:41.181 --> 01:43:41.748

SEND SEND OF ENOUGH FOR YOUR

01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:58.932
MODELING. I THINK IT'S

01:43:58.999 --> 01:44:00.133
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT CAP

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.768
AND TRADE IS NOT THE ONLY TOOL

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:02.536
THAT WE HAVE TO REDUCE

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:04.771
EMISSIONS ANDIT'S ONE OF MANY

01:44:04.838 --> 01:44:05.906
TOOLS AND A SUITE OF POLICIES

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:07.774
AND THE SCOPING PLAN WHAT YOU

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:08.609

LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD SO

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:23.390
WHEN WE SEE VALUE SUCH AS A

01:44:23.457 --> 01:44:24.524
HUNDRED DOLLARS A TON WHAT

01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:25.859
YOU'RE SEEING IS PRICES IF

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:27.327
THERE WAS ONLY A CAP AND TRADE

01:44:27.394 --> 01:44:28.428

REDUCE EMISSIONS AND SO-

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.101
COMPARING THOSE PRICES AGAINST

01:44:34.167 --> 01:44:35.836
EACH OTHER ISN'T COMPARING

01:44:35.902 --> 01:44:37.771
APPLES TO APPLES NECESSARILY.

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:39.339
IN TERMS OF THE PRICES FOR THE

PROGRAM AND THE NEXT DECADE

01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:43.310
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT WE'VE

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:45.145
REDUCED EMISSIONS BELOW THE

01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:45.746
TWENTY TWENTY TARGET FOR YEARS

FAST ADVANCE IN CARS TO MAKE

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:54.054
SURE WE HAD THE TWENTY TWENTY

01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:56.056
TARGET. WERE HAD A SCHEDULE BUT

01:44:56.123 --> 01:44:57.557
WHAT ALSO HAPPENED IN THE LAST

01:44:57.624 --> 01:44:59.493
COPING PLAN IS WE SIGNALED THAT

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:03.030
STARTING FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:45:03.096 --> 01:45:03.630
TO TWENTY THIRTY WE HAVE TO

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:06.066
HAVE A MORE STRINGENT PROGRAMS.

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:08.835

STRINGENT AND SO THOSE PER AND

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:16.710
THAT STRAY STARTS TO KICK IN IN

01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:18.278
EARLY TWENTY TWENTY EARLY

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:20.280
TWENTY TO START EARLY TWENTY

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:25.318
TWENTY ONE AND I DON'T. ALL SIX

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:27.421
LOOKS LIKE SO THE NEXT DECADE

01:45:27.487 --> 01:45:28.488
IN TERMS OF RESPONSE FROM

SOURCES- IS GONNA LOOK QUITE

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.261
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT LOOKS

01:45:34.327 --> 01:45:35.562
LIKE TODAY BECAUSE EVERYONE'S

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:36.630
GOING TO BE RESPONDING TO MUCH

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:38.732
MORE STRINGENT PROGRAMS THE LA-

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:41.234
RICHEST REPORTED THAT ALL THE

TWENTY TWENTY CAN BE-

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:51.044
ACCUMULATED ELECTRIC TRICITY

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:52.412
SECTION IS THE R. P. S.

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:54.147
STANDARDS ALL THE REST OF THE

01:45:54.214 --> 01:45:55.682
PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOW COULD BE

01:45:55.749 --> 01:45:57.551
MORE STRINGENT DID NOTHING.

01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:59.786
ESSENTIALLY FOR AS FAR AS HE

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:01.788
MISSION REDUCTION RELATIVELY

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:02.923
NOTHING I MEAN THEY THEY MOVE

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:04.591
FROM ONE SIDE OF THE GRAPH THE

01:46:04.658 --> 01:46:06.560
OTHER SERIGRAPH BUT FLAT LINED

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:08.528
SINCE SINCE WE STARTED THE

01:46:08.595 --> 01:46:11.865
AUCTION PROGRAM SEVEN YEARS AGO

01:46:11.932 --> 01:46:14.134
SO. I'VE BEEN CRITICAL OF I

01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:16.603
THINK IT'S NOT ENOUGH OF THE

01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:17.971
GUIDANCE THAT YOU GIVEN TO THAT

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:20.207
THE MARKET PLACE AND YES WE'RE

01:46:20.273 --> 01:46:21.508
ALL GOING TO HOLD OUR BREATH

01:46:21.575 --> 01:46:23.210
TILL TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT WE

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:24.511
HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE

01:46:24.578 --> 01:46:25.545
MOVEMENT AND WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:46:25.612 --> 01:46:27.848
SEEN. INCREASES IN SOME OF

01:46:27.914 --> 01:46:32.085
THESE AND AREAS SO I A CAN YOU.

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:33.687
OTHER THAN YOU HAVE A PLAN AND

01:46:33.754 --> 01:46:34.821
YOU HAVE A OR YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:36.189
HOPING FOR IT THERE ARE OTHER

01:46:36.256 --> 01:46:38.759
MECHANISMS SO YOU CAN YOU YOU

01:46:38.825 --> 01:46:40.494
CAN PRICE. THE CARBON I MEAN

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.362
YOU YOU. THERE'S THERE IS A

01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:43.830
SIGNAL THAT YOU CAN GIVE TO THE

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:46.333
MARKET- WITH THE WITH THE PRICE

01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:49.035
THAT- THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:50.604
THERE SEEMS TO BE A HESITATION

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:53.607
BY. THIS ADMINISTRATION TO TELL

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:55.742
CALIFORNIANS OR TELL THE WORLD

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:57.244
THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT

01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:58.845
PRICING CARBON AND WE'RE WE'RE

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:00.213
SORT OF RELYING ON THESE

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.948
PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE A

01:47:02.015 --> 01:47:04.484
LACKLUSTER. FIVE PERFORMANCE

01:47:04.551 --> 01:47:06.987
SAVE THE U. BIO USED SAID OF

01:47:07.053 --> 01:47:09.723
HAVE HELPED BUILD THIS OUT ON

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:11.591
OUR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. I AM

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:13.426
SO I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:14.561
THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE LIKE

01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:15.595
A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:17.798
VANCE CLEAN CARS THOSE PROGRAMS

01:47:17.864 --> 01:47:19.966
HAVE DELIVERED REDUCTIONS IF IT

01:47:20.033 --> 01:47:21.168
WEREN'T FOR THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

01:47:21.234 --> 01:47:22.235
MISSIONS WOULD BE A LOT HIGHER

01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:24.371
TODAY AND SO EVEN THOUGH WHEN

01:47:24.437 --> 01:47:25.572
YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH IT LOOKS

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:26.540
LIKE. THE REDUCTIONS HAVING

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:27.808
OCCURRED WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:29.309
CONSTRAINED REDUCTIONS AND IN

01:47:29.376 --> 01:47:31.011
THE ABSENCE OF THOSE PROGRAMS

01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:32.646
REDUCTION OR EMISSIONS WOULD BE

01:47:32.712 --> 01:47:34.681
MUCH HIGHER- WITH LC FEST WE'VE

01:47:34.748 --> 01:47:35.982
DONE ESTIMATES BACK OF THE

01:47:36.049 --> 01:47:37.317
ENVELOPE ESTIMATES THAT THEY

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:38.418
WOULD BE FIVE MILLION TONS

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:39.719
HIGHER EVERY YEAR FOR THE LAST

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:41.154
FEW YEARS IF THAT PROGRAM

01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:43.323
HADN'T BEEN IN PLACE. AND SO WE

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:45.525
TOOK TO HEART THE COMMENTS THAT

01:47:45.592 --> 01:47:46.593
THE EARLIER REPORT MADE ABOUT

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.428
THE RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES AND

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:49.896
WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT AND

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:51.064
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO T.

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:52.532
SOME OF THIS INFORMATION OUT TO

01:47:52.599 --> 01:47:55.001
MAKE IT AVAILABLE. AND IN TERMS

01:47:55.068 --> 01:47:57.571
OF THE SIGNALS AND THE PRICES

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:58.505
AND WHY WE SEEM A LITTLE

01:47:58.572 --> 01:47:59.940
RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF

01:48:00.006 --> 01:48:01.775
THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS MARKET

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:04.477
ADMINISTRATORS WHAT WE SAY AND

01:48:04.544 --> 01:48:05.612
HOW WE DISCUSSED THE MARKET

01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:08.248
FUNDAMENTALS AND MARKET DESIGN.

01:48:08.315 --> 01:48:09.950
CAN SEND UNINTENDED SIGNAL TO

01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:11.618
THE MARKET AND ADD UNCERTAINTY

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:13.587
AND SO WE TRY TO AVOID THAT IN

01:48:13.653 --> 01:48:15.722
PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS WE TRY TO

01:48:15.789 --> 01:48:16.289
THINK ABOUT HOW TO THOUGHT

01:48:16.356 --> 01:48:17.257
FLUENTLY REALLY HAVE THOSE

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:19.159
DISCUSSIONS SO THAT EVERYBODY

01:48:19.226 --> 01:48:20.493
IS ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.062
AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON

01:48:22.128 --> 01:48:23.930
IN THE CONTEXT AROUND IT. I

01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:25.565
THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CAPS

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:27.334
FOR CAP AND TRADE YOU SEE THAT

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.668
THEY ARE DROPPING FOURTEEN

01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:30.737
MILLION TONS YEAR OVER YEAR

01:48:30.804 --> 01:48:32.806
STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:33.640
THAT'S A HUGE SIGNAL TO THE

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:34.774
MARKET PLACE. AND THAT'S

01:48:34.841 --> 01:48:36.309
ALREADY BEEN PRICED IN AND

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:38.044
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING PRICES

01:48:38.111 --> 01:48:41.047
IN THE OPTIONS STEP LEAVE ABOUT

01:48:41.114 --> 01:48:42.115
FOUR PRICE TODAY. LISTEN

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:44.184
INTERESTING BUT WE'RE I DO ONE

01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:46.019
MORE QUESTION ON THE ALLOWANCES

01:48:46.086 --> 01:48:47.554
PRODUCER HAS BEEN INTERNATIONAL

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:49.623
CRITICISM OF TOO MANY FREE

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:51.358
ALLOWANCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

01:48:51.424 --> 01:48:53.326
RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S BEEN A

01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:55.195
PRODUCT OF AS THE- AS THE

01:48:55.262 --> 01:48:57.097
OPERATOR OF THE MARKET THAT

01:48:57.163 --> 01:48:58.999
THEIR URGES THERE ARE WAY TOO

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:00.433
MANY AND THE SIGNAL THAT YOU'RE

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:01.902
GIVING IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO

01:49:01.968 --> 01:49:03.436
BE MORE FREE ALLOWANCES. THAT

01:49:03.503 --> 01:49:04.771
ARE GONNA BE AVAILABLE THERE'S

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:08.441
A GLUT OF ALLOWANCES RIGHT NOW

01:49:08.508 --> 01:49:11.778
THAT IS NOT CHANGING BEHAVIOR

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:12.712
FROM THE STATION SOURCES IN THE

01:49:12.779 --> 01:49:14.147
COVER. COVERED ENTITIES WHAT'S

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:18.585
THE- I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A

DEBATE CLASS SERVICE. I HAD A

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:22.188
ROUGH DAY YESTERDAY I'M SORRY

01:49:22.255 --> 01:49:26.693
OKAY. OKAY SO THE AMOUNT OF

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.428
ALLOWANCES THAT WE GIVE IT TO

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:30.430
INDUSTRY IS TO FOLLOW THE

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:31.831
DIRECTION AB THIRTY TO ABOUT

01:49:31.898 --> 01:49:33.433
MINIMIZING LEAKAGE YOU DON'T

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:34.401
WANT INDUSTRY TO MOVE

01:49:34.467 --> 01:49:35.635
PRODUCTION IF YOU DON'T WANT

01:49:35.702 --> 01:49:36.603
INDUSTRY TO PICK UP A MOVE

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:38.371
OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:49:38.438 --> 01:49:39.539
SO IT LOOKS LIKE ON OUR BOOKS

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:41.074
WE ACHIEVED A REDUCTION BUT THE

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:41.841
AT THE EMISSIONS ARE ACTUALLY

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:43.209
KERN SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY'RE

01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:44.978
STILL HAPPENING SO WE GIVE

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:46.346
ALLOWANCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:48.214
CAN HELP KEEP THE INDUSTRY

01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:50.483
COMPETITIVE BUT STILL SEND SOME

01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:51.952
SIGNAL TO THEM THAT THEY NEED

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:53.086
TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND SO WE

01:49:53.153 --> 01:49:55.522
DON'T GIVE ANYBODY A 100% OF

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:56.089
THE ALLOWANCES THEY NEED TO

01:49:56.156 --> 01:50:00.193
COMPLY. WHAT HAPPENS IS IN AB

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:00.827
THREE EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:02.195
WE GOT DIRECTION. TO CONSIDER

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:05.098
ALL INDUSTRY. AS HIGH RISK FOR

01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:07.534
LEAKAGE. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.868
SEEING IN A REGULATION NOW AND

01:50:08.935 --> 01:50:10.737
THE- REGULATION THAT WE ADOPTED

01:50:10.804 --> 01:50:12.439
TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH AB

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:13.039
THREE NINETY EIGHT IS. THE WE

01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:14.341
HAVE A SUSTAINED AMOUNT OF FREE

01:50:14.407 --> 01:50:16.876
ALLOCATION TO INDUSTRY- BASED

01:50:16.943 --> 01:50:18.778
ON DIRECTION IN LEGISLATION.

01:50:18.845 --> 01:50:20.280
BUT STILL EVEN UNDER THAT

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:21.748
SCENARIO WE'RE STILL NOT GIVING

01:50:21.815 --> 01:50:23.149
ANYBODY A 100% OF WHAT THEY

01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:24.718
NEED. SO PEOPLE ARE STILL

01:50:24.784 --> 01:50:27.454
FACING- A NEED TO EITHER REDUCE

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.290
EMISSIONS ON SITE OR GOING TO

01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:30.790
THE MARKET PLACE AND BY

01:50:30.857 --> 01:50:34.728
ALLOWANCES. OKAY MR HOTEL HAS

01:50:34.794 --> 01:50:36.563
OF COURSE I WOULD SAY YOU WON

01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:40.767
THAT DEBATE. I FOR ONE HAVE

01:50:40.834 --> 01:50:44.404
FEEL VERY- REFRESH THAT WE HAVE

01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:46.373
A REGULATOR THAT'S LOOKING AT

01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:48.975
ALL THESE ISSUES THAT YOU'LL

01:50:49.042 --> 01:50:52.545
WITH LEAKAGE. AND YOU KNOW

01:50:52.612 --> 01:50:53.713
PUTTING A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:54.948
IT I YOU KNOW I I'M REALLY

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:56.649
LOOKING TO LEARN A LOT MORE IN

01:50:56.716 --> 01:50:58.651
THIS AREA IN I GUESS TOUGH THE

01:50:58.718 --> 01:51:00.954
ONE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS

01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.489
HAVE YOU DONE ANY STUDIES ON.

01:51:02.555 --> 01:51:05.425
LIKE THE PRICE ELASTICITY ON-

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:06.793
YOU KNOW THIS AUCTION AND IF

01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:09.295
IT. WE WERE TO GO TO A POINT

01:51:09.362 --> 01:51:11.297
WHERE WE- ARBITRARILY INCREASE

01:51:11.364 --> 01:51:14.000
THE PRICE WHAT ARE THE CHANCES

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:16.770
OF. YOU HEALTH. ACTUALLY

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:18.705
GETTING LAST OR NOT GETTING

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:22.509
ENOUGH- THE- MARGINALLY TO MAKE

01:51:22.575 --> 01:51:24.277
IT EFFECTIVE IN THE LAST COPING

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:25.879
PLAN THAT THE BOARD ADOPTED IN

01:51:25.945 --> 01:51:27.447
LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE

01:51:27.514 --> 01:51:29.215
RAN A SCENARIO WHERE WE HAD A

01:51:29.282 --> 01:51:30.784
CARBON PRICE OF FIFTY DOLLARS A

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:33.253
TON. AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED IN

01:51:33.319 --> 01:51:34.387
THAT IS THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY

01:51:34.454 --> 01:51:35.955
HAVE INDUSTRY AND EMISSIONS

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:37.791
LEAKAGE OCCURRING THE STATE

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:38.892
BECAUSE OUR INDUSTRY WOULD NOT

01:51:38.958 --> 01:51:41.294
BE COMPETITIVE AT THAT PRICE

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:43.163
AND THEY'RE ONLY. RESPONSE

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:44.130
WOULD BE TO EITHER REDUCE

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:45.832
PRODUCTION IN STATE OR HAVE

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:47.767
THAT ACTIVITY MOVE OUT OF STATE

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:48.802
AND SO WE HAVE THE ECONOMIC

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:50.703
ANALYSES WE HAVE ALL OF THE

01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:51.538
TECHNICAL WORK TO SUPPORT THAT

01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:53.840
SCENARIO AND THAT EVALUATION ON

01:51:53.907 --> 01:51:55.075
OUR WEBSITE WOULD BE HAPPY TO.

01:51:55.141 --> 01:51:55.909
SHARE THAT YEAH I'D LIKE TO SEE

01:51:55.975 --> 01:51:57.977
THAT. I SHOULD PREFACE THAT

01:51:58.044 --> 01:51:59.379
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY

01:51:59.446 --> 01:52:02.682
COLLEAGUE- FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY.

01:52:02.749 --> 01:52:09.789
THE. SO I AND I AND- JUST TO

01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:11.724
GET YOUR REACTION TO. THE ISSUE

01:52:11.791 --> 01:52:15.795
OF CREDIBILITY OKAY THE

01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:19.399
CREDIBILITY- FACTOR IS VERY

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:22.368
IMPORTANT WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS.

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:23.903
AND TO HAVE CREDIBILITY IN THE

01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:29.242
TRANSPORTATION. AREA WHEN YOU

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:33.146
ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF EMISSIONS

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:37.217
REDUCTIONS PROGRAMS ARE OPTIONS.

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:41.354
IT REQUIRES THE PROPER ANALYSIS

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:44.657
AND A PROPER FEAR ANALYSIS I

01:52:44.724 --> 01:52:46.392
DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE OKAY

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:48.928
WE'RE NOT THERE SO. THE

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:52.932
QUESTION IS. HOW DO WE GO ABOUT

01:52:52.999 --> 01:52:54.934
CREATING A STRUCTURE. DEAD

01:52:55.001 --> 01:52:58.104
IMPROVES THE PROPER ANALYSIS IN

01:52:58.171 --> 01:53:01.241
THE TRANSPORTATION AREA SO

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:03.443
THAT'S THE QUESTION BOB VEHICLE

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:05.778
MILES TRAVELED I DON'T LIKE

01:53:05.845 --> 01:53:08.615
THAT OKAY I'M A I'M A PLANNER I

01:53:08.681 --> 01:53:09.983
WAS ON THE METROPOLITAN

01:53:10.049 --> 01:53:13.286
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FOR

01:53:13.353 --> 01:53:15.021
TWENTY TWO YEARS OKAY SIR DODD.

01:53:15.088 --> 01:53:17.857
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IS ONE

01:53:17.924 --> 01:53:18.424
WAY TO LOOK AT IT YOU ALSO

01:53:18.491 --> 01:53:20.827
SHOULD LOOK AT. THINGS LIKE

01:53:20.894 --> 01:53:23.630
CONGESTION ARE YOU ARE YOU.

01:53:23.696 --> 01:53:25.431
LIKE MY WIFE SAYS I DON'T

01:53:25.498 --> 01:53:27.333
REALLY CARE HOW MANY MILES HAVE

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.669
TO TRAVEL I CARE HOW LONG IT

01:53:29.736 --> 01:53:30.203
TAKES TO GET TO WHERE I'M

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:32.372
GOING. AND I THINK THE AVERAGE

01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:33.740
PERSON LOOKS AT IT THAT WAY

01:53:33.806 --> 01:53:35.608
QUITE FRANKLY. THEY WANT TO

01:53:35.675 --> 01:53:39.712
KNOW WHAT. THE TIME IT TAKES

01:53:39.779 --> 01:53:41.214
NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THE TIME IT

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:43.783
TAKES. WOULD MEAN THAT THE CAR

01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:46.386
WOULD BE RUNNING A LONGER. AND

01:53:46.452 --> 01:53:47.987
THEREFORE POLLUTING MORE. OKAY

01:53:48.054 --> 01:53:52.392
SO CARD OTHER OTHER IDEAS WOULD

01:53:52.458 --> 01:53:53.860
BE HOW MUCH GASOLINE IS BEING

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:57.230
USED. GOT OVERALL GASOLINE

01:53:57.297 --> 01:53:58.932
USAGE I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO

01:53:58.998 --> 01:54:01.834
LOOK AT SOME KIND OF

01:54:01.901 --> 01:54:03.970
MEASUREMENT DID MEASURES THAT.

01:54:04.037 --> 01:54:06.372
I ALSO THINK I ALSO THINK. THEN

01:54:06.439 --> 01:54:11.544
WHEN WE PROPOSED. POLICIES ON

01:54:11.611 --> 01:54:16.249
TRANSPORTATION AREA. WE SHOULD

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:18.785
FIND EMILY LOOK AT IT WHAT DOES

01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:19.319
IT DO IN TERMS OF TRANSIT

01:54:19.385 --> 01:54:21.521
RIDERSHIP. ARE WE PROMOTING

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:23.223
PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR CARS

01:54:23.289 --> 01:54:24.924
EITHER WALKING BY SCHOOLING OR

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:27.427
USING TRANSIT. IS THERE ARE-

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:30.830
APPALLED IS DOES THE POLICY-

01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:35.501
HELD. CONVERT PEOPLE FROM USING

01:54:35.568 --> 01:54:39.472
CARS WHICH POLLUTES. I WE I

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:41.474
WOULD EVEN ARGUE THAT ELECTRIC

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:43.443
CARS POLLUTE BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:45.111
STILL HAVE THE NUMBER OF CARS

01:54:45.178 --> 01:54:46.946
IN THE POPULATION GROWS AND

01:54:47.013 --> 01:54:49.682
EVERYBODY BUYS CARS AND THE

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:51.551
FREEWAYS STATE CONGESTED.

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:53.253
THERE'S OTHER CARS ARE OUT

01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:53.853
THERE THAT ARE POLLUTING MORE%

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:56.956
BECAUSE- THE VEHICLE HOURS

01:54:57.023 --> 01:54:59.259
TRAVEL IS CONTAINED TO GET

01:54:59.325 --> 01:55:00.960
LONGER THE MEDIC GASOLINE

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:02.095
PURCHASE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:03.263
HAVING MORE ELECTRIC CARS THEM

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:04.931
OUT OF GASOLINE. THAT'S

01:55:04.998 --> 01:55:07.700
PURCHASED IS CONTINUE TO RISE

01:55:07.767 --> 01:55:08.901
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STAY IN

01:55:08.968 --> 01:55:13.039
THEIR CARS LONGER AND FROM THE

01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:15.241
TAXPAYERS STANDPOINT THEY WANT.

01:55:15.308 --> 01:55:16.943
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET TO

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:19.545
AND FROM WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

01:55:19.612 --> 01:55:21.414
IN LESS TIME OKAY THAT'S-

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.116
THAT'S A THAT'S A GOAL THAT

01:55:23.182 --> 01:55:26.486
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. SO I

01:55:26.552 --> 01:55:28.821
HAD A QUESTION REGARDING THAT

01:55:28.888 --> 01:55:32.358
IS- IS THERE ANYBODY LOOKING

01:55:32.425 --> 01:55:35.295
AT. CHANGING THE FRAMEWORK TO

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:37.430
EMPHASIZE TRANSIT. TRANSIT

01:55:37.497 --> 01:55:40.800
RIDERSHIP IS TRANSIT RIGHT IS

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:41.768
THE IMPACT OF YOUR POLICIES ON

01:55:41.834 --> 01:55:44.837
TRANSIT RIDERSHIP LOOKED OUT.

01:55:44.904 --> 01:55:47.674
OF I'M I'M A MAJOR ADVOCATE

01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:48.941
I'VE BEEN PROBABLY ONE OF THE

01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:51.311
BIGGEST ADVOCATES IN. THE STATE

01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:53.046
FOR TRANSIT RIDERS TRANSIT

01:55:53.112 --> 01:55:55.882
PROGRAMS SO HOW DO YOU ANALYZE

01:55:55.948 --> 01:55:58.051
TRANSIT. IN TERMS OF HOW WOULD

01:55:58.117 --> 01:56:00.086
YOU ANALYZE IT ROSS AND MAYBE

01:56:00.153 --> 01:56:03.189
CAN. AND CREATE A PROPER

01:56:03.256 --> 01:56:06.492
SYSTEMATIC WAY OF LOOKING AT

01:56:06.559 --> 01:56:10.496
THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE I MEAN.

01:56:10.563 --> 01:56:12.632
CENTER ABOUT MINUTES- I THINK

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:14.267
IT DIFFICULT QUESTION AND TO BE

01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:15.368
QUITE FRANK I DON'T KNOW THAT I

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:17.970
HAVE AN EXACT ANSWER- BUT I

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:19.739
THINK CERTAINLY KIND OF ANSWER

01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:20.807
ANYWHERE THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING

01:56:20.873 --> 01:56:22.208
YEAH SO I MEAN I THINK

01:56:22.275 --> 01:56:23.509
CERTAINLY THINKING ABOUT

01:56:23.576 --> 01:56:25.311
THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:56:25.378 --> 01:56:26.846
THE KIND OF WHAT WHAT WHAT IS

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:27.980
THE GOAL THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:56:28.047 --> 01:56:29.382
ACHIEVE IS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT

01:56:29.449 --> 01:56:30.717
MORE TRANSIT RIGHT PART OF IT

01:56:30.783 --> 01:56:32.652
SO YEAH IS IT. MORE PEOPLE

01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:34.454
USING TRANSIT RIGHT AND SO AS

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:35.421
FAR AS SORT OF SETTING UP A

01:56:35.488 --> 01:56:37.457
STRUCTURE FOR GETTING GOOD

01:56:37.523 --> 01:56:39.325
ANSWERS TO THAT AND I THINK ONE

01:56:39.392 --> 01:56:40.626
IMPORTANT THING IN OUR MIND IS

01:56:40.693 --> 01:56:42.128
THINKING ABOUT AS PROGRAMS ARE

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:44.797
BEING IMPLEMENTED. IN THE EARLY

01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:46.499
STAGES THINKING ABOUT HOW ARE

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:47.700
WE GOING TO GET ANSWERS TO SOME

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:48.634
OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE

01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:50.069
ASKING HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:52.038
ANSWERS TO HOW IT HAS AFFECTED

01:56:52.105 --> 01:56:53.539
TRANSIT RIDERSHIP BECAUSE THESE

01:56:53.606 --> 01:56:54.774
ARE ARE OFTENTIMES VERY

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:56.876
DIFFICULT QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

01:56:56.943 --> 01:56:57.677
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:56:57.744 --> 01:56:58.911
DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT ARE

01:56:58.978 --> 01:57:00.413
INFLUENCING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP.

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.348
IN ADDITION TO A SPECIFIC

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:02.949
PROGRAM THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED

01:57:03.015 --> 01:57:04.984
WHEN YOU ANALYZE THE GREENHOUSE

01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:07.620
GAS. EMISSIONS REDUCTION

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:11.190
POLICIES DO THEY SPECIFICALLY

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:14.927
LOOK AT HOW THAT IMPACTS

01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:16.596
TRANSIT RIDERSHIP THAT'S-

01:57:16.662 --> 01:57:18.264
THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:20.666
IN MY OPINION. BECAUSE OF AN

01:57:20.733 --> 01:57:22.502
IMPASSE IT IN A NEGATIVE WAY.

01:57:22.568 --> 01:57:24.771
YOU SHOULD SAY THAT ALL THE

01:57:24.837 --> 01:57:27.106
POLICIES WE DO DO NOT. DECREASE

01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:28.975
OR IMPACT IN A NEGATIVE WAY

01:57:29.041 --> 01:57:31.711
TRANSIT RIDERSHIP. THAT SIR MY

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:35.982
VIEW IF I SEE MORE. POLICIES

01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:37.450
THAT- SOUND LIKE THEY'RE GOOD

01:57:37.517 --> 01:57:38.818
BUT THEN THE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP

01:57:38.885 --> 01:57:41.287
IS IMPACTED IN A BAD WAY I

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:42.522
DON'T I DON'T PARTICULARLY

01:57:42.588 --> 01:57:45.057
THINK THAT'S ACHIEVING OUR

01:57:45.124 --> 01:57:45.792
THAT'S GOES IN THE WRONG

01:57:45.858 --> 01:57:48.561
DIRECTION WHICH YEAH SO OUR

01:57:48.628 --> 01:57:50.897
ANALYSIS LOOKED AT GREENHOUSE

01:57:50.963 --> 01:57:52.465
GAS EMISSIONS WOULD NOT FOCUS

01:57:52.532 --> 01:57:55.501
ON- TRANSIT RIDERSHIP THERE ARE

01:57:55.568 --> 01:57:57.003
WITH THIS SESSIONS ABOUT FROM

01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:58.538
MY EYES SURE THE COMMITTEE ON

01:57:58.604 --> 01:58:00.406
TRANSPORTATION. I'M INTERESTED

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:02.241
IN A TRANSIT RIDERSHIP PART OF

01:58:02.308 --> 01:58:03.342
YEAH I THINK THERE ARE FOR

01:58:03.409 --> 01:58:05.011
CERTAIN SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:06.446
MIGHT BE KIND OF A PIECE OF THE

01:58:06.512 --> 01:58:07.747
ANALYSIS THAT THEY DO ON KIND

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:09.015
OF TRYING TO ESTIMATES-

01:58:09.081 --> 01:58:10.249
OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT

01:58:10.316 --> 01:58:11.417
I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT- THE

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:13.085
DETAILS OF THAT AND GET BACK TO

01:58:13.152 --> 01:58:14.954
YOU OKAY THANK YOU I WILL SAY I

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:16.289
THINK THE NEXT PANEL- WE GOT A

01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:17.490
COUPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSIT

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:19.792
EXPERTS- YEAH RIGHT WHO CAN.

01:58:19.859 --> 01:58:23.496
BANG FLASH ON THE SIDE. TRANSIT

01:58:23.563 --> 01:58:24.797
RIDERSHIP. STUFF OUT THE YOU'RE

01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:25.865
TALKING BUT I'M PASSED ABOUT AS

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:28.234
WELL SO. LOSE WITH YOUR

01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:30.069
FORBEARANCE NUMBER AMOUNT OF

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:32.505
GASOLINE ISN'T THAT A YEAH THE-

01:58:32.572 --> 01:58:34.607
PEOPLE CAN. DO THEY LOOK AT

01:58:34.674 --> 01:58:35.608
LIKE WHEN THEY LOOK AT GREEN

01:58:35.675 --> 01:58:37.944
EYES SEEMS LIKE HOW MUCH

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:39.679
GASOLINE IS PURCHASED. I MEAN

01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:43.249
THAT'S- THE GASOLINE'S BERM SO

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:45.785
IT'S POLLUTING SO WHEN WE SEE

01:58:45.852 --> 01:58:50.456
THE GASOLINE. PURCHASES FROM

01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:52.592
NIGHT DECREES THAT'S THIS KIND

01:58:52.658 --> 01:58:54.694
OF A BAD BILL WHETHER FOR US IN

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.295
TERMS OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

01:58:56.362 --> 01:58:59.365
EMISSIONS RIGHT SO THE KIND OF

01:58:59.432 --> 01:59:03.603
DEALING WITH THAT ISSUE. I'LL

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:04.937
JUST ADD IT IS JENNIFER DRESS

THEIR PLANS AND SO WILL WE WILL

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:22.755
LOOK AT TRANSIT RIDERSHIP AS

01:59:22.822 --> 01:59:24.490
PART OF THEIR PLAN IF IT'S A IF

01:59:24.557 --> 01:59:26.826

OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO ALL.

02:00:48.608 --> 02:00:50.476
I'M SUSAN HANDY I'M A PROFESSOR

02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:52.078
AT UC DAVIS WHERE I DIRECT THE

02:00:52.144 --> 02:00:53.579
NATIONAL CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE

02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:56.782
TRANSPORTATION- OF MY OWN WORK-

02:00:56.849 --> 02:01:00.152
FOCUSES ON. THE VMT QUESTIONS

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:02.154
SO MY COMMENTS WILL BE AND

02:01:02.221 --> 02:01:04.824
FOCUSED ON THAT. SO AS WE HEARD

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.626
THIS MORNING THE STATE HAS MADE

02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:08.127
SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON

02:01:08.194 --> 02:01:11.330
REDUCING EMISSIONS THROUGH. OF

02:01:11.397 --> 02:01:12.932
FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS

02:01:12.999 --> 02:01:14.634
EMISSIONS STANDARDS INCENTIVES

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:17.003
FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES- BUT

02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:18.904
ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE STATE

02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:21.440
WILL NOT MEET ITS GHG EMISSIONS

02:01:21.507 --> 02:01:23.376
GOALS WITHOUT ALSO REDUCING

02:01:23.442 --> 02:01:27.046
VEHICLE MILES OF TRAVEL- BY AS

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:29.548
MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT- THIS

02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:31.684
IS A TALL ORDER GIVEN HOW MUCH

02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:34.153
DRIVING CALIFORNANS DO. A IS

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:36.188
APPROACHING TEN THOUSAND MILES

02:01:36.255 --> 02:01:38.224
PER YEAR PER PERSON IN THE

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:40.660
STATE FOR A WHILE IT LOOKED

02:01:40.726 --> 02:01:42.895
LIKE THINGS WERE LEVELING OUT-

02:01:42.962 --> 02:01:44.964
BUT LATEST DATA SUGGESTS THAT

02:01:45.031 --> 02:01:50.302
IT'S TRENDING BACK UPWARDS. IF

02:01:50.369 --> 02:01:52.371
THANK YOU SO BE AND HE IS ALL

02:01:52.438 --> 02:01:53.706
OF IT OFTEN BEEN CALLED THE

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:55.608
SHAKY THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL

02:01:55.675 --> 02:01:57.276
MUCH HARDER TO ADDRESS THAN

02:01:57.343 --> 02:01:58.878
VEHICLES AND FUELS BUT

02:01:58.944 --> 02:02:01.313
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO MEETING

02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:03.416
OUR GOALS THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

02:02:03.482 --> 02:02:05.418
IF WE CAN DO IT WE GET MANY

02:02:05.484 --> 02:02:08.220
BENEFITS BEYOND- JUST EMISSIONS

02:02:08.287 --> 02:02:10.623
REDUCTIONS- OTHER KINDS OF

02:02:10.690 --> 02:02:12.391
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ECONOMIC

02:02:12.458 --> 02:02:15.661
BENEFITS SOCIAL EQUITY BENEFITS

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:16.162
AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH

02:02:16.228 --> 02:02:17.997
BENEFITS BUT OF COURSE THE BIG

02:02:18.064 --> 02:02:20.166
QUESTION IS HOW TO DO IT. AND

02:02:20.232 --> 02:02:21.667
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS

02:02:21.734 --> 02:02:23.569
QUESTION I APPROACH IT WITH A-

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:26.305
A TWO STEP FRAMEWORK- IF YOU

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:27.907
WILL AND ONE OF THE IMPORTANT

02:02:27.973 --> 02:02:29.442
POINT I WANT TO MAKE. THIS

02:02:29.508 --> 02:02:30.943
MORNING IS THAT BOTH OF THESE

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:33.813
STEPS ARE VERY MUCH NECESSARY.

02:02:33.879 --> 02:02:35.815
SO THE FIRST STEP IS TO MAKE IT

02:02:35.881 --> 02:02:38.751
POSSIBLE TO DRIVE LESS AND

02:02:38.818 --> 02:02:40.119
THAT'S GONNA TAKE EFFORTS AT

02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:41.654
THE LOCAL SCALE AS WELL AS THE

02:02:41.721 --> 02:02:43.656
REGIONAL SCALE. SO THE LOCAL

02:02:43.723 --> 02:02:45.591
SCALE WE NEED LAND USE PATTERNS

02:02:45.658 --> 02:02:48.260
THAT BRING DESTINATIONS- WITHIN

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:50.496
CLOSER REACH THAT WOULD MAKE

02:02:50.563 --> 02:02:52.398
DRIVING DISTANCES SHORTER AS

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:53.899
WELL AS WALKING AND BIKING MORE

02:02:53.966 --> 02:02:56.635
VIABLE- WE NEED INVESTMENTS TO

02:02:56.702 --> 02:02:57.970
IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND THE

02:02:58.037 --> 02:03:00.039
QUALITY. OF THE WALKING AND

02:03:00.106 --> 02:03:01.874
BIKING EXPERIENCE THAT WILL

02:03:01.941 --> 02:03:05.377
ALSO HELP TRANSIT- WE'VE GOT

02:03:05.444 --> 02:03:06.579
BIKE SHARINGAND SCOOTER

02:03:06.645 --> 02:03:08.314
SHARING PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.616
ADDING TO OUR LOCAL OPTIONS BUT

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:12.084
WE NEED BETTER WAYS TO

02:03:12.151 --> 02:03:14.987
INTEGRATE THOSE. INTO OUR LOCAL

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.655
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. AT THE

02:03:16.722 --> 02:03:17.823
REGIONAL SCALE WE NEED

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.859
INVESTMENTS IN TRANSIT SERVICE

02:03:19.925 --> 02:03:21.460
BOTH RAIL AND BUS TO IMPROVE

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:23.095
THE QUALITY AND THE COVERAGE OF

02:03:23.162 --> 02:03:25.297
THAT SERVICE. WE NEED LAND USE

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:26.432
PATTERNS THAT ENHANCE THE

02:03:26.499 --> 02:03:27.600
VIABILITY OF TRANSIT WHICH

02:03:27.666 --> 02:03:30.603
MEANS HIGHER DENSITIES AROUND

02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:32.638
TRANSIT STATIONS IT MEANS

02:03:32.705 --> 02:03:35.107
LOCATING KEY REDDICK REGIONAL

02:03:35.174 --> 02:03:36.942
DESTINATIONS LIKE STADIUMS-

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:39.912
NEAR RAIL STATIONS- AND OF

02:03:39.979 --> 02:03:40.746
COURSE WE NEED AFFORDABLE

02:03:40.813 --> 02:03:44.550
HOUSING. IN SHOP RICH AREAS. SO

02:03:44.617 --> 02:03:45.451
IF WE CAN DO THESE THINGS WE

02:03:45.518 --> 02:03:46.752
CREATE COMMUNITIES WHERE IT IS

02:03:46.819 --> 02:03:48.854
POSSIBLE TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO

02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:53.159
DO WITHOUT DRIVING SO MUCH- IF

02:03:53.225 --> 02:03:53.726
WE DO THIS WE GET IMPORTANT

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:57.396
EQUITY BENEFITS. IN TERMS OF

02:03:57.463 --> 02:04:00.666
ENSURING ADEQUATE ACCESSIBILITY

02:04:00.733 --> 02:04:02.501
FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO

02:04:02.568 --> 02:04:03.435
DRIVE FOR ONE REASON OR

02:04:03.502 --> 02:04:05.805
ANOTHER- AND WE KNOW THAT WE

02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:07.573
CAN'T DO THIS THAT WE'VE GOT

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:08.941
EXAMPLES OF ALL OF THESE

02:04:09.008 --> 02:04:11.210
STRATEGIES. IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:12.444
HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THEM FROM

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:14.780
SECRETARY KIM THIS MORNING-

02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:16.448
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS IN

02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:19.451
MY TIME A IN THE FIELD THAT WE

02:04:19.518 --> 02:04:21.754
CLEARLY HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:23.823
THE SECOND STEP. IS THAT WE

02:04:23.889 --> 02:04:25.624
ALSO NEED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:28.027
TO DRIVE LESS- SIMPLY GIVING

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:29.795
THEM THE OPTION THE OPPORTUNITY

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:31.530
TO DRIVE LESS DOESN'T GUARANTEE

02:04:31.597 --> 02:04:33.265
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT. SO

02:04:33.332 --> 02:04:35.467
WE CAN OFFER A CARROT APPROACH

02:04:35.534 --> 02:04:37.536
WE CAN TRY AND ENTICE PEOPLE TO

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:40.306
DRIVE LESS- WE COULD TRY SOCIAL

02:04:40.372 --> 02:04:42.041
MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO CHANGE

02:04:42.107 --> 02:04:44.610
THE NORMS AROUND DAILY TRAVEL.

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:46.445
THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO BE ENOUGH

02:04:46.512 --> 02:04:48.414
WE COULD TRY PAYING PEOPLE TO

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.782
CHOOSE ALTERNATIVES AND THERE'S

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:51.984
SOME. EXAMPLES OF THAT AND THAT

02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:54.019
COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE- BUT

02:04:54.086 --> 02:04:55.554
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WERE ALSO CAN

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:58.657
AND NEED TO WIELD THE STICK.

02:04:58.724 --> 02:04:59.892
AND THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS THAT

02:04:59.959 --> 02:05:01.994
WE CAN DO THIS SO ONE STICK WE

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:03.796
CAN WIELD OF COURSE IS TO MAKE

02:05:03.863 --> 02:05:05.931
DRIVING MORE EXPENSIVE. THROUGH

02:05:05.998 --> 02:05:08.000
VARIOUS FORMS OF PRICING WE'VE

02:05:08.067 --> 02:05:09.535
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT PARKING

02:05:09.602 --> 02:05:11.470
PRICING THIS MORNING. ON THE

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:12.738
SORT OF CORDON PRICING THIS

02:05:12.805 --> 02:05:14.473
BEING CONSIDERED IN LA AND SAN

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:17.610
FRANCISCO. ALL OF THESE THINGS-

02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:18.644
I THINK NEED TO BE ON THE

02:05:18.711 --> 02:05:20.646
TABLE. OF COURSE PRICING ALWAYS

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:23.582
RAISES EQUITY CONCERNS BUT- IS

02:05:23.649 --> 02:05:24.917
PRETTY CLEAR THEIR WAYS THAT

02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:27.586
THOSE CAN BE MITIGATED- THROUGH

02:05:27.653 --> 02:05:28.988
INVESTMENTS IN THE ALTERNATIVES

02:05:29.054 --> 02:05:30.923
TO DRIVING AND- EVEN PROVIDING

02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:34.326
SUBSIDIES- WHERE NEEDED. A

02:05:34.393 --> 02:05:36.629
SECOND STICK TO THINK ABOUT IS

02:05:36.695 --> 02:05:37.863
MAKING DRIVING LESS

02:05:37.930 --> 02:05:40.933
CONVENIENCE. ON AN EXAMPLE OF

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.001
THIS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTING

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:44.136
PARKING MAXIMIN MAXIMUMS RATHER

02:05:44.203 --> 02:05:45.237
THAN PARKING MINIMUMS THAT

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:47.106
MAKES DRIVING LESS CONVENIENT.

02:05:47.172 --> 02:05:48.607
AND ALSO HAS A SIDE BENEFIT OF

02:05:48.674 --> 02:05:49.975
MAKING WALKING BIKING AND

02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:55.714
pANOTHER EXAMPLE IS CLOSING

02:05:55.781 --> 02:05:57.449
STREETS TO PRIVATE VEHICLES THE

02:05:57.516 --> 02:05:59.051
WAY THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAS DONE

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:00.419
ON MARKET STREET AND APPARENTLY

02:06:00.486 --> 02:06:04.423
LA IS CONSIDERING THIS. AS WELL.

02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:05.791
BUT A THIRD STICK I WANT TO

02:06:05.858 --> 02:06:08.727
MENTION IS CONGESTION ITSELF AS

02:06:08.794 --> 02:06:11.330
A DETERRENT TO DRIVING- CLOGGED

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:12.698
ROADS MAY BE ONE OF THE

02:06:12.765 --> 02:06:14.300
GREATEST INCENTIVES TO GET

02:06:14.366 --> 02:06:16.068
PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS AND

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:16.502
TRYING SOME OF THESE

02:06:16.568 --> 02:06:18.504
ALTERNATIVES. AND OF COURSE

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:20.239
THAT THEN RAISES THE QUESTION

02:06:20.306 --> 02:06:22.942
ABOUT- DO WE WANT TO BE

02:06:23.008 --> 02:06:25.044
EXPANDING HIGHWAYS IF OUR GOAL

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:28.514
IS TO REDUCE. THE M. T. AND

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:29.615
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:31.517
EVIDENCE ON THE INDUCED TRAVEL

02:06:31.583 --> 02:06:35.621
A FACT- OF AT A CAPACITY SHOWS

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:38.557
THAT THE ANSWER IS A CLEAR NO-

02:06:38.624 --> 02:06:41.694
THAT IF WE INCREASE CAPACITY WE

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:45.197
INCREASE THE ANTI. WITHOUT

02:06:45.264 --> 02:06:48.300
ACTUALLY DECREASING CONGESTION

02:06:48.367 --> 02:06:52.004
IN ANY APPRECIABLE WAY SO I

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:53.138
THINK WE NEED TO BE DOING ALL

02:06:53.205 --> 02:06:56.108
OF THESE THINGS- AND CLEARLY WE

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:57.943
NEED TO BE DOING BOTH OF THESE

02:06:58.010 --> 02:07:01.313
BOTH OF THESE STEPS IF WE- IF

02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:02.915
WE PUSH PEOPLE TO DRIVE LAST

02:07:02.982 --> 02:07:03.882
WITHOUT GIVING THEM

02:07:03.949 --> 02:07:05.317
ALTERNATIVES THAT JUST CREATES

02:07:05.384 --> 02:07:09.121
PAIN FRUSTRATION- BUT IF WE DO

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:10.422
THE FIRST STEP IN TERMS OF

02:07:10.489 --> 02:07:11.523
PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH

02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:13.459
OPPORTUNITIES WITHOUT ALSO

02:07:13.525 --> 02:07:15.327
ENCOURAGING THEM TO USE THEM

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:16.428
THAT WOULD SORT OF WASTED THE

02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:20.099
EFFORTS- IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO

02:07:20.165 --> 02:07:22.134
I JUST WANNA AND BY POINTING TO

02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:23.736
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ALL OF

02:07:23.802 --> 02:07:25.237
OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THIS IS EASIER

02:07:25.304 --> 02:07:27.973
SAID THAN DONE- ONE OF THE BIG

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.441
CHALLENGES THAT. THAT WE'RE

02:07:29.508 --> 02:07:31.176
SEEING IT ARE THE SO CALLED

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:34.580
DISRUPTIONS IN TRANSPORTATION-

02:07:34.646 --> 02:07:36.548
THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

02:07:36.615 --> 02:07:39.151
COMPANIES LIKE UBER AND LIFT-

02:07:39.218 --> 02:07:41.286
THAT ARE ARE CHANGING HOW

02:07:41.353 --> 02:07:42.488
PEOPLE ARE GETTING AROUND ON A

02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:45.157
DAILY BASIS EVIDENCE SO FAR. IS

02:07:45.224 --> 02:07:47.192
THAT THEY ARE INCREASING RATHER

02:07:47.259 --> 02:07:49.661
THAN DECREASING V. M. T. OF

02:07:49.728 --> 02:07:51.196
WHICH POINTS TO THE NEED TO

02:07:51.263 --> 02:07:53.198
ENCOURAGE THE SHARED VERSIONS

02:07:53.265 --> 02:07:55.534
OF THESE KINDS OF SERVICES- BIG

02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:57.069
QUESTION ABOUT AUTOMATED

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:59.071
VEHICLES LOOMING OVER US IN THE

02:07:59.138 --> 02:08:01.273
FUTURE HUGE UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.442
WHEN- THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AND

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:05.978
HOW IT'S GONNA PLAY OUT. BUT

02:08:06.045 --> 02:08:08.380
AGAIN POINTING TO VERY LIKELY

02:08:08.447 --> 02:08:11.116
POSSIBILITIES OF THE INCREASE

02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:11.850
INCREASES IN V. M. T. AS A

02:08:11.917 --> 02:08:14.019
RESULT. SO WE'RE DOING A LOT OF

02:08:14.086 --> 02:08:15.888
WORK AT UC DAVIS TO LOOK AT

02:08:15.954 --> 02:08:18.123
THESE SORTS OF QUESTIONS-

02:08:18.190 --> 02:08:19.491
AUSTIN MAY SPEAK A LITTLE MORE

02:08:19.558 --> 02:08:21.427
ABOUT THAT- AND THINK ABOUT

02:08:21.493 --> 02:08:23.595
WHAT SORT OF POLICIES. WOULD

02:08:23.662 --> 02:08:25.864
PUSH THESE DISRUPTIONS IN A WAY

02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:28.934
THAT WILL. MINIMIZE THE

02:08:29.001 --> 02:08:30.436
ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS SECOND

02:08:30.502 --> 02:08:32.738
CHALLENGE AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:34.006
IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO TAKE

02:08:34.073 --> 02:08:34.940
ACTION AT ALL LEVELS OF

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:36.675
GOVERNMENT. THEIR THINGS THE

02:08:36.742 --> 02:08:39.311
STATE CAN DO ITSELF- I THINK

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:41.547
PARTICULARLY AROUND PRICING-

02:08:41.613 --> 02:08:42.848
BUT THE STATE IS ALSO GOING TO

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:43.982
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WYS TO

02:08:44.049 --> 02:08:45.317
MOTIVATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL

02:08:45.384 --> 02:08:48.420
GOVERNMENTS. A TO BE ADOPTING

02:08:48.487 --> 02:08:50.089
THE RIGHT SORTS OF POLICIES.

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:51.390
AND THEN I WILL ADD A THIRD

02:08:51.457 --> 02:08:53.225
CHALLENGE. WHICH IS THAT WE

02:08:53.292 --> 02:08:56.962
NEED BETTER DATA AND RESEARCH-

02:08:57.029 --> 02:08:58.664
TO REALLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS

02:08:58.730 --> 02:09:01.300
OF THE STATE- AND IT'S CLEAR

02:09:01.366 --> 02:09:03.902
THAT WE- THAT THERE'S A LOT WE

02:09:03.969 --> 02:09:05.604
STILL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS

02:09:05.671 --> 02:09:06.605
WE NEEDWE NEED HELP

02:09:06.672 --> 02:09:08.841
DEVELOPING. THIRD NEW TOOLS AND

02:09:08.907 --> 02:09:11.443
METHODS- SO THAT LOCAL

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:12.978
GOVERNMENTS CAN CAN MAKE THE

02:09:13.045 --> 02:09:15.514
RIGHT DECISIONS- WE HAVE A

02:09:15.581 --> 02:09:17.549
PROJECT AT AUSTIN'S LEADING. AT

02:09:17.616 --> 02:09:20.819
UC DAVIS THAT'S LOOKING AT- HOW

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:22.855
TO EVALUATE- THE KINDS OF

02:09:22.921 --> 02:09:24.523
PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED

02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:27.860
BY THE- G. G. R. F. WE NEED TO

02:09:27.926 --> 02:09:28.927
BE COLLECTING DATA AND

02:09:28.994 --> 02:09:31.330
EVALUATING THE STRATEGIES AS

02:09:31.396 --> 02:09:34.166
THEY ARE BEING ADOPTED- WE ALSO

02:09:34.233 --> 02:09:36.368
NEED IMPROVE METHODS AND TOOLS-

02:09:36.435 --> 02:09:38.871
WE'VE GOT SOME WORK FOR. BOTH

02:09:38.937 --> 02:09:41.640
CAR AND CALTRANS AT. THAT'S

02:09:41.707 --> 02:09:44.109
WORKING ON THIS QUESTION- THE

02:09:44.176 --> 02:09:45.644
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MANY OF THEM

02:09:45.711 --> 02:09:47.179
ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT

02:09:47.246 --> 02:09:48.046
THING BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:09:48.113 --> 02:09:51.517
RIGHT TO IT. TOOLS IN HAND- TO

02:09:51.583 --> 02:09:54.353
DO THAT IN A IN A CONFIDENT WAY.

02:09:54.419 --> 02:09:56.488
SO I THINK THAT'S A NICE NOTED

02:09:56.555 --> 02:09:58.557
AND DONE MORE RESEARCH. VERY

02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:02.461
MUCH. THANK YOU- THAT'S MY

DAD'S A PROFESSOR AND NOT

ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO END YOUR

02:10:05.731 --> 02:10:07.933
ESSAYS IS TO SAY THAT THIS

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.502
TOPIC RAISES THE NEED FOR MORE

02:10:10.569 --> 02:10:12.905
RESEARCH SO. OKAY WILL WILL

02:10:12.971 --> 02:10:14.873
WILL- WILL NEXT COULD ANOTHER

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:16.742

THE- DECISION MAKING ON ON

02:11:22.007 --> 02:11:23.809
CLIMB I BRING AN UPBEAT MESSAGE

TODAY. I'M HAPPY TO SAY- THIS

02:11:26.345 --> 02:11:28.413
RESEARCH BASICALLY LOOKED AT

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:29.948
THE STATE'S ASPIRATIONS FOR

02:11:30.015 --> 02:11:32.351
EASY DEPLOYMENT AS YOU KNOW-

02:11:32.417 --> 02:11:33.785
ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT IS SOMEWHAT

02:11:33.852 --> 02:11:35.587
DISAPPOINTING BY THAT STANDARD.

02:11:35.654 --> 02:11:39.291
BUT WE ASK THE QUESTION IF- IF.

02:11:39.358 --> 02:11:40.926
THE DEPLOYMENT DID SUCCEED WHAT

02:11:40.993 --> 02:11:42.294
WOULD BE THE ECONOMIC

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:44.029
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS. AND WE

THAT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN PAGES LONG

02:11:52.104 --> 02:11:54.106
THE- ACTUAL REPORT IS TEN TIMES

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:55.941
THIS LINK SO I'M GONNA GO VERY

02:11:56.008 --> 02:11:57.643
QUICKLY TO SUMMARIZE- THE MAIN

02:11:57.709 --> 02:12:01.546
FINDINGS. BUT AS I SAID- WE'VE

02:12:01.613 --> 02:12:03.415
THERE'S BEEN SOME

02:12:03.482 --> 02:12:04.316
DISAPPOINTMENT- THAT'S BEEN

02:12:04.383 --> 02:12:05.817
DISCUSSED ALREADY THIS MORNING-

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:07.152
THE STATE'S NOT ATTRACTED ME TO

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:08.687
SCHOOLS. TRANSPORTATION

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:10.289
EMISSIONS ARE RISING AS YOU CAN

02:12:10.355 --> 02:12:13.191
SEE ON PAGE THREE- SEVEN AND-

02:12:13.258 --> 02:12:15.594
AND OTHER- LOW EMISSIONS-

02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:18.297
VEHICLE TAX ADOPTION HAS BEEN

02:12:18.363 --> 02:12:19.631
IT HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:21.500
STATE'S STANDARDS. AND TO MEET

02:12:21.566 --> 02:12:22.034
THOSE GOALS IS GOING TO

02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:26.238
REQUIRE- A REALLY DETERMINE

02:12:26.305 --> 02:12:27.539
EFFORT. TO PROMOTE A DOG ON

02:12:27.606 --> 02:12:29.241
BEHALF OF BOTH THE POLICY

02:12:29.308 --> 02:12:31.276
MAKERS AND OF COURSE THE-

02:12:31.343 --> 02:12:34.179
VEHICLE SECTOR ITSELF- WE CAME

02:12:34.246 --> 02:12:35.881
UP WITH A SET OF SCENARIOS

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:38.717
WHICH ESSENTIALLY CAPTURED-

02:12:38.784 --> 02:12:40.152
WHAT I WOULD CALL THE SORT OF

02:12:40.218 --> 02:12:41.586
STATUS QUO PERSPECTIVE IT'S

02:12:41.653 --> 02:12:43.822
EMBODIED IN CC SO LONG TERM

02:12:43.889 --> 02:12:46.458
ENERGY STRATEGY- THAT WE CAME

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:47.492
OUT ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I WAS

02:12:47.559 --> 02:12:49.895
INVOLVED IN THAT- AND- WITH

02:12:49.961 --> 02:12:51.496
SOME OTHER. A RESEARCH

02:12:51.563 --> 02:12:53.332
INSTITUTIONS IN SUPPORTING CC

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:55.500
NCCC GENERALISES GENEROUSLY

02:12:55.567 --> 02:12:58.203
SUPPORTED OUR WORK ON THIS- BUT

02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:59.504
THAT IS SORT OF THE STATE OF

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:02.107
THE ART AS OF TWO YEARS AGO AND

02:13:02.174 --> 02:13:02.641
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:13:02.708 --> 02:13:04.576
TECHNOLOGIES- SINCE THEN WE

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:07.079
HAVE A MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC-

02:13:07.145 --> 02:13:08.547
TECHNOLOGY COST ESTIMATES FOR

02:13:08.613 --> 02:13:10.849
THE SECTOR. MUCH OF WHICH IS

02:13:10.916 --> 02:13:12.150
BEEN SPONSORED IN COLLABORATION

02:13:12.217 --> 02:13:13.952
WITH IDEAS AND DAVIS IS

02:13:14.019 --> 02:13:17.155
EFFORTS- TO PROMOTE RESEARCH.

02:13:17.222 --> 02:13:18.990
ON IN THE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES

02:13:19.057 --> 02:13:19.958
AND THEN WE ASK ANOTHER

02:13:20.025 --> 02:13:21.993
QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT ABOUT-

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:23.862
WHAT ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF

02:13:23.929 --> 02:13:26.498
VEHICLE OWNERSHIP- THIS IS NOT

02:13:26.565 --> 02:13:27.499
WHAT WE CALL AN INCLUSIVE

02:13:27.566 --> 02:13:29.534
PROCESS BY ANY STANDARD- THE

02:13:29.601 --> 02:13:30.969
INNOVATIVE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES

02:13:31.036 --> 02:13:32.738
WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE STILL WELL

02:13:32.804 --> 02:13:34.840
BEYOND THE REACH OF LOW INCOME

02:13:34.906 --> 02:13:36.108
COMMUNITIES. AROUND THE STATE

02:13:36.174 --> 02:13:40.445
YOU CAN SEE IN- IT THE FIGURES

02:13:40.512 --> 02:13:42.614
I THINK IT'S ON PAGE. SEVEN THE

02:13:42.681 --> 02:13:43.815
ACQUISITION OF THESE NEW

02:13:43.882 --> 02:13:45.717
VEHICLES IS DOMINATED BY-

02:13:45.784 --> 02:13:47.052
ESSENTIALLY AFFLUENT WHITE

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:48.787
POPULATION SO FAR THE STATE'S

02:13:48.854 --> 02:13:50.956
WELL AWARE THIS SEE BRP IS NOW

02:13:51.022 --> 02:13:53.291
BEING- RETOOL TO PROVIDE A MORE

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:56.094
INCLUSIVE. PROVIDE FOR MORE

02:13:56.161 --> 02:13:58.597
INCLUSIVE STRATEGIES- BUT STILL

02:13:58.663 --> 02:14:01.400
WE'RE SEEING- ADOPTION IN IN A

02:14:01.466 --> 02:14:03.802
RELATIVELY UNEQUAL MATTER-

02:14:03.869 --> 02:14:05.103
LARGELY BY INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:14:05.170 --> 02:14:06.505
MIGHT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THESE

02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:07.005
TECHNOLOGIES WITHOUT THE

02:14:07.072 --> 02:14:08.740
INCENTIVES IRONICALLY. BUT IN

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:11.877
ANY CASE WE ASK THIS QUESTION.

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:13.812
IN ORDER TO MEET ITS GOALS-

02:14:13.879 --> 02:14:15.247
THERE HAVE TO BE SUBSTANTIAL

02:14:15.313 --> 02:14:17.482
EDUCATION THE VEHICLE FLEET BY

02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:18.850
TWENTY THIRTY AN EVEN MORE

02:14:18.917 --> 02:14:21.052
DRAMATIC- DISPLACEMENT OF

02:14:21.119 --> 02:14:23.321
CARBON FUEL VEHICLES BY. TWENTY

02:14:23.388 --> 02:14:26.591
FIFTEEN- WE LOOKED AT THE- WHAT

02:14:26.658 --> 02:14:27.826
WOULD HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF

02:14:27.893 --> 02:14:29.995
DOING THAT- ON THE KIND OF

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:31.096
BUSINESS AS USUAL

02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:32.397
DISTRIBUTIONAL BASIS MEANING

02:14:32.464 --> 02:14:34.032
THAT. OWNERSHIP WOULD CONVERGE

02:14:34.099 --> 02:14:35.600
BY TWENTY FIFTY BUT NOT MUCH

02:14:35.667 --> 02:14:37.302
EARLIER THAN THAT AND THEN WE

02:14:37.369 --> 02:14:38.336
HAVE A SO CALLED EQUITY

02:14:38.403 --> 02:14:41.306
SCENARIO WHERE- POLICIES WHICH

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:43.241
HAVE YET TO BE DEVISED AND WE

02:14:43.308 --> 02:14:45.177
DON'T HAVE A ROADMAP FOR THIS.

02:14:45.243 --> 02:14:47.646
THREAD WOULD ACHIEVE AN

02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:48.914
EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:52.584
VEHICLES BY- TWENTY THIRTY. AND

02:14:52.651 --> 02:14:55.353
CONTINUE TO- INCREASE OVERALL

02:14:55.420 --> 02:15:00.392
FLEET- EVEY ADOPTION- TO TWENTY

02:15:00.459 --> 02:15:01.560
FIFTY BUT ESSENTIALLY DO SO

02:15:01.626 --> 02:15:03.328
UNIFORMLY SO THAT THERE'S A

02:15:03.395 --> 02:15:04.529
REAL TO THE EQUAL ACCESS AROUND

02:15:04.596 --> 02:15:06.164
THE STATE TO THESE VEHICLES.

02:15:06.231 --> 02:15:07.566
SIGNIFICANT SO THAT'LL BE CLEAR

02:15:07.632 --> 02:15:09.234
IN JUST A MOMENT BUT LET ME

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:10.569
BEGIN WITH A KIND OF A PUNCH

02:15:10.635 --> 02:15:14.439
LINE- THE MOST DRAMATIC RESULTS

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:17.042
OF THIS STUDY IS OUR DISCOVERY

02:15:17.108 --> 02:15:19.311
THAT DEVIATE OPTION IS A POTENT

02:15:19.377 --> 02:15:22.714
CATALYST FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:23.315
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

02:15:23.381 --> 02:15:24.483
THE REASON FOR THAT IS ACTUALLY

02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:26.284
VERY SIMPLE I CAN MAKE THIS

02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:29.054
WITH AN ECON ONE- ARGUMENTS- WE

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:30.655
SIMPLY DEVELOP THE EVIDENCE TO

02:15:30.722 --> 02:15:32.824
DEMONSTRATE. HOW POTENT THIS

02:15:32.891 --> 02:15:34.192
THING IS IT'S CALLED THE CANS

02:15:34.259 --> 02:15:37.329
IN MULTIPLIER. THE REASON-

02:15:37.395 --> 02:15:39.197
THAT. THERE IS A STIMULUS IN

02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:40.799
THE FIRST PLACE ARE YOU CAN SEE

02:15:40.866 --> 02:15:42.801
ON PAGE THIRTEEN. THERE'S AN

02:15:42.868 --> 02:15:44.736
EXAMPLE OF A VERY NICE LITTLE-

02:15:44.803 --> 02:15:47.772
DEVICE FROM THE WE- WHICH IS

02:15:47.839 --> 02:15:48.874
SITTING ON ITS WEBSITE RIGHT

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:50.008
NOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THE

02:15:50.075 --> 02:15:51.676
COMPARES THE OPERATING COST IN

02:15:51.743 --> 02:15:55.046
TERMS OF- OF IT OF FIVE. IF YOU

02:15:55.113 --> 02:15:57.382
ENERGIES EITHER FOR CARBON FUEL

02:15:57.449 --> 02:16:01.853
OR A- GASOLINE THAT SAY. OR OR

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:05.290
ELECTRIC TO. ELECTRIC POWER AND

02:16:05.357 --> 02:16:05.824
IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT COST

02:16:05.891 --> 02:16:07.759
ADVANTAGE TODAY. BETWEEN

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:09.794
ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN OPERATING

02:16:09.861 --> 02:16:10.829
THE REASON THAT ISN'T

02:16:10.896 --> 02:16:12.163
TRANSLATING INTO OVERALL

02:16:12.230 --> 02:16:13.298
ECONOMIC BENEFITS IS THAT THESE

02:16:13.365 --> 02:16:14.232
VEHICLES ARE STILL TO BE MORE

02:16:14.299 --> 02:16:15.734
EXPENSIVE THAN GASOLINE POWERED

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:18.236
VEHICLE SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO

02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:20.305
PAY BACK THE COST DIFFERENTIAL.

02:16:20.372 --> 02:16:21.373
ACOSTA DIFFERENTIAL BY THE

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:23.375
STANDARDS OF THE OF THE

02:16:23.441 --> 02:16:26.678
RESEARCH THAT OF THIS IS BEN I

02:16:26.745 --> 02:16:29.214
GUESS SPONSORED IN PART BUT

02:16:29.281 --> 02:16:31.082
ALSO A PROMOTED JUST THROUGH

02:16:31.149 --> 02:16:34.052
COLLEGIALITY BY IDEAS. INTO THE

02:16:34.119 --> 02:16:35.987
LATEST TECHNOLOGY COST

02:16:36.054 --> 02:16:37.088
ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT WILL

02:16:37.155 --> 02:16:39.057
REACH PARITY WITH- CONVENTIONAL

02:16:39.124 --> 02:16:41.893
FUEL VEHICLES BY THE MIDDLE OF

02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:45.063
THIS DECADE. SO THIS WON'T BE A

02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:46.298
PROBLEM ANYMORE AND THOSE COST

02:16:46.364 --> 02:16:47.566
SAVINGS THE OPERATING BECAUSE

02:16:47.632 --> 02:16:48.733
IT WAS WILL BEGIN TO KICK IN

02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:50.769
RIGHT AWAY THOSE TRANSLATE INTO

02:16:50.835 --> 02:16:52.637
AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FOUR

02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:55.040
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. OF

02:16:55.106 --> 02:16:56.608
FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES OVER THE

02:16:56.675 --> 02:16:59.110
TERM AVERAGE SCHIRMER THEIR USE

02:16:59.177 --> 02:17:00.478
NINE TO ELEVEN YEARS. NOW

02:17:00.545 --> 02:17:02.647
REMEMBER THIS SIZE OF THE

02:17:02.714 --> 02:17:04.583
VEHICLE FLEET IN CALIFORNIA. IF

02:17:04.649 --> 02:17:05.817
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF

02:17:05.884 --> 02:17:07.319
CARS BEING ADOPTED REALLY I

02:17:07.385 --> 02:17:08.486
MEAN FOR DIDN'T TAKE THIS

02:17:08.553 --> 02:17:10.622
ASPIRATION SERIOUSLY. THAT'S AN

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:14.125
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SAVINGS FOR

02:17:14.192 --> 02:17:16.328
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE UNITED STATES.

02:17:16.394 --> 02:17:19.564
EXACTLY RIGHT EXACTLY RIGHT.

02:17:19.631 --> 02:17:21.099
FOUR THOUSAND TIMES THIRTY FIVE

02:17:21.166 --> 02:17:22.934
MILLION THAT'S REAL MONEY TODAY

02:17:23.001 --> 02:17:24.769
CALIFORNIANS SPEND OVER FIFTY

02:17:24.836 --> 02:17:26.304
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:29.140
GASOLINE. AND IF THOSE SAVINGS

02:17:29.207 --> 02:17:30.875
CAN BE REDIRECTED INTO THINGS

02:17:30.942 --> 02:17:33.278
THAT HOUSEHOLDS REALLY WANT.

02:17:33.345 --> 02:17:34.579
THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY

02:17:34.646 --> 02:17:37.415
POTENT STIMULANT. SO THIS IS

02:17:37.482 --> 02:17:40.051
THE THIS IS WHERE THE STIMULUS

02:17:40.118 --> 02:17:42.120
COMES FROM WHAT IS A GO IMAGINE

02:17:42.187 --> 02:17:44.990
pMETAPHORICALLY AND YOU TAKE A

02:17:45.056 --> 02:17:47.259
DOLLAR- THAT GAS AS A HOUSEHOLD

02:17:47.325 --> 02:17:49.160
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WELL IT

02:17:49.227 --> 02:17:52.430
TURNS OUT THAT HOUSEHOLDS SPEND

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:52.931
70% OF THEIR- INCOME ON

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:55.066
SERVICES. THAT MEANS THAT IF WE

02:17:55.133 --> 02:17:57.002
CAN RE DIRECT EXPENDITURE

02:17:57.068 --> 02:17:59.037
YOU'LL SEE THIS ON PAGE TWELVE.

02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:00.238
IF THE EXPENDITURE OF THOSE

02:18:00.305 --> 02:18:03.041
SAVINGS IS DIRECTED IN THE

02:18:03.108 --> 02:18:04.709
USUAL WAY REMEMBER WE ALL LIVE

02:18:04.776 --> 02:18:06.978
IN A POST INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY

02:18:07.045 --> 02:18:08.580
CALIFORNIA LIKE MOST OF THE

02:18:08.647 --> 02:18:09.180
HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES AROUND

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:11.282
THE WORLD LIVES BY THE SEVENTY

02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:14.919
SEVENTY RULE. 70% OF GDP IS

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:16.287
HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION THE

02:18:16.354 --> 02:18:17.889
HOUSEHOLD AS A PRIMARY DRIVER

02:18:17.956 --> 02:18:19.290
THE CONSUMERS THE PRIMARY

02:18:19.357 --> 02:18:21.793
DRIVER OF THE ECONOMY. SAME IS

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:22.360
TRUE IN CALIFORNIA LOOK AT

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:25.864
HIGHER ACTUALLY. AND 70% OF

02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:27.766
THAT CONCEPTION IS FOR SERVICES.

02:18:27.832 --> 02:18:29.701
WE GET TO OVER TWO THIRDS OF

02:18:29.768 --> 02:18:31.236
OUR EMPLOYMENT BY GIVING EACH

02:18:31.302 --> 02:18:32.437
OTHER HAIR CUTS IN THE SERVICE

02:18:32.504 --> 02:18:33.772
OF DRINKS WE ARE LIVING IN A

02:18:33.838 --> 02:18:35.573
POST INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY. SO

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:37.842
WHAT WE BASICALLY SEE IS THAT

02:18:37.909 --> 02:18:39.844
THE SAVINGS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:42.113
A YEAR. IN ENERGY SAVINGS FROM

02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:44.049
OPERATING ELECTRIC VEHICLES

02:18:44.115 --> 02:18:46.785
WILL BE REDIRECTED INTO SERVICE

02:18:46.851 --> 02:18:49.187
SECTOR DEMAND. THESE ARE JOBS

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:50.922
ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE WITH

02:18:50.989 --> 02:18:52.357
THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE

02:18:52.424 --> 02:18:54.693
ENERGY FUEL SECTOR SORRY BUT I

02:18:54.759 --> 02:18:55.994
HAVEN'T FOUND A WAY TO DO CAR

02:18:56.061 --> 02:18:58.730
MINUTES ECONOMY THIS NOT

02:18:58.797 --> 02:18:59.264
ADVERSE TO THE FOSSIL FUEL

02:18:59.330 --> 02:19:02.734
SECTOR. I HAD TO TALK TO A

02:19:02.801 --> 02:19:04.069
JOURNALIST KERN COUNTY ABOUT

02:19:04.135 --> 02:19:04.803
THIS IT WAS SOMEWHAT

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:06.938
EMBARRASSING BUT- THAT SECTOR'S

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:08.840
GOING TO SUFFER THAT CAN BE.

02:19:08.907 --> 02:19:10.775
REALLY CAN'T BE AVOIDED BUT THE

02:19:10.842 --> 02:19:12.744
REST OF THE ECONOMY WILL SEE

02:19:12.811 --> 02:19:15.080
VERY STRONG STIMULUS HOW STRONG

02:19:15.146 --> 02:19:16.481
LIMóN LET'S LOOK AT THE MACRO

02:19:16.548 --> 02:19:18.516
RESULTS NOW THAT YOU KNOW- THAT

02:19:18.583 --> 02:19:19.451
I'VE EXPLAINED A MECHANISM TO

02:19:19.517 --> 02:19:20.985
YOU. LET'S LOOK AT THE MACRO

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:22.854
RESULTS IN TWENTY THIRTY. WILL

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:23.688
BE LOOKING A GROSS STATE

02:19:23.755 --> 02:19:26.124
PRODUCT IT'S EIGHTY TWO BILLION

02:19:26.191 --> 02:19:27.492
DOLLARS HIGHER AND ARE MORE

02:19:27.559 --> 02:19:30.662
CONSERVATIVE SCENARIO. IN IT.

02:19:30.729 --> 02:19:32.297
BUT SOMEONE I'M A PAGE ELEVEN.

02:19:32.363 --> 02:19:36.000
RIGHT YEAH THE TOP TABLE ON

02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:37.602
PAGE ELEVEN YEAH I'M SORRY THIS

02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:39.170
ISN'T AN SAID THIS REPORTS I'M

02:19:39.237 --> 02:19:39.904
GOING OUT OF SEQUENCE WITH

02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:41.539
REPORTS I WANT TO GET TO THE

02:19:41.606 --> 02:19:43.541
PUNCH LINES FOR THIS WE DON'T

02:19:43.608 --> 02:19:46.978
HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT. 86% YEAH

02:19:47.045 --> 02:19:48.213
EIGHTY TWO BILLION TWO HUNDRED

02:19:48.279 --> 02:19:49.948
AND FORTY BILLION OF ADDITIONAL

02:19:50.014 --> 02:19:51.916
REAL GDP AS AFTER DISCOUNTING

02:19:51.983 --> 02:19:53.852
FOR INFLATION BY TWENTY THIRTY

02:19:53.918 --> 02:19:55.487
BY TWENTY FIFTY WERE LOOKING IT

02:19:55.553 --> 02:19:58.056
OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS IN

02:19:58.123 --> 02:20:01.059
ADDED GDP BECAUSE OF THE

02:20:01.126 --> 02:20:03.762
VERSION OF EXPENDITURE FROM THE

02:20:03.828 --> 02:20:06.531
FOSSIL FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN. TO

02:20:06.598 --> 02:20:07.932
THE THINGS THAT HOUSEHOLDS

02:20:07.999 --> 02:20:09.634
REALLY SPEND THEIR MONEY ON.

02:20:09.701 --> 02:20:11.002
TWO THIRDS OF WHICH MORE THAN

02:20:11.069 --> 02:20:11.636
TWO THIRDS OF WHICH ARE

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:13.705
SERVICES. TO THIS CREATES BROAD

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:16.274
BASED EMPLOYMENT IT CREATES

02:20:16.341 --> 02:20:19.110
MANY MORE JOBS. THEN THE FOSSIL

02:20:19.177 --> 02:20:20.812
FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN MOST OF WHICH

02:20:20.879 --> 02:20:21.780
LEAKS OUT OF THE STATE ANYWAY

02:20:21.846 --> 02:20:23.882
CALIFORNIA PRODUCES 20% OF ITS

02:20:23.948 --> 02:20:27.018
OWN OIL. BUT THE JOB CREATION

02:20:27.085 --> 02:20:29.220
EFFECT IS GOING ACROSS ALL

02:20:29.287 --> 02:20:31.756
SERVICES. AND REMEMBER THESE

02:20:31.823 --> 02:20:34.626
ARE IN STATE SERVICES THESE ARE

02:20:34.692 --> 02:20:36.861
JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUT SOURCE.

02:20:36.928 --> 02:20:38.029
SO IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

02:20:38.096 --> 02:20:39.631
DRIVER OF THE ECONOMY BUT IN

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:40.932
FACT THAT'S THE STATUS QUO

02:20:40.999 --> 02:20:42.400
DRIVERS WILL BE EXPANDING

02:20:42.467 --> 02:20:43.768
EMPLOYMENT ACROSS ALL INCOME

02:20:43.835 --> 02:20:46.538
GROUPS. AND ACROSS ALL SERVICE

02:20:46.604 --> 02:20:47.772
SECTOR OCCUPATIONS AND ARE

02:20:47.839 --> 02:20:49.741
THESE ARE JUST LOW WAGE JOBS

02:20:49.808 --> 02:20:51.009
MEMBER SERVICES INCLUDE LEGAL

02:20:51.075 --> 02:20:52.644
SERVICES WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:53.912
LOW WAGE MEDICAL SERVICES

02:20:53.978 --> 02:20:56.681
ETCETERA. SO THIS EXPENDITURE

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:58.616
DIVERSION THAT'S FUELED BY NOPE

02:20:58.683 --> 02:21:00.919
INTENTIONAL PUN PLEASE AT THAT

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:03.321
IS FEEL BY. ENERGY SAVINGS FROM

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:05.056
ELECTRIC VEHICLES IF WE CAN

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:09.060
ACHIEVE OUR OUR- OUR LUXURY

02:21:09.127 --> 02:21:10.428
VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT GOALS. WOULD

02:21:10.495 --> 02:21:12.597
BE A VERY POTENT CATALYST FOR

02:21:12.664 --> 02:21:13.832
ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT'S THE

02:21:13.898 --> 02:21:15.333
FIRST MESSAGE THE SECOND MAIN

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:16.768
MAJOR MESSAGE OF THE REPORT

02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:18.369
CONCERNS PUBLIC HEALTH AS

02:21:18.436 --> 02:21:20.205
YOU'RE WELL AWARE VEHICLE STONE

02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:22.173
JUST IN IN THAT CO TWO DAMMIT

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:23.641
TOXIC CHEMICALS AND THOSE

02:21:23.708 --> 02:21:25.410
BECAUSE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

02:21:25.476 --> 02:21:27.045
PROBLEMS. WHICH ARE MORE

02:21:27.111 --> 02:21:28.680
CONCENTRATED IN SOME

02:21:28.746 --> 02:21:30.181
COMMUNITIES THAN OTHERS AND

02:21:30.248 --> 02:21:31.382
STATE I KNOW IS WELL AWARE OF

02:21:31.449 --> 02:21:32.717
THE SO CALLED DISADVANTAGED

02:21:32.784 --> 02:21:34.252
COMMUNITY CHALLENGE WHICH WE

02:21:34.319 --> 02:21:36.521
ADDRESSES AS PART OF THE THIRD

02:21:36.588 --> 02:21:40.758
PIECE OF THE STUDY. BUT WE FIND

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:42.360
THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS.

02:21:42.427 --> 02:21:43.928
OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT

02:21:43.995 --> 02:21:45.964
INTERNS REDUCING LOCAL CRITERIA

02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:47.398
POLLUTANTS THE REMEMBER THEY

02:21:47.465 --> 02:21:48.533
THEY CONSIDER TO DISCLOSE UP

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:50.301
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND AFFECTS

02:21:50.368 --> 02:21:51.970
GLOBAL WARMING WE'RE REALLY

02:21:52.036 --> 02:21:54.138
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. BUT THIS

02:21:54.205 --> 02:21:55.506
REPORT IS NOT ABOUT SAVING THE

02:21:55.573 --> 02:21:57.208
PLANET THAT'S A LOOK THAT'S A

02:21:57.275 --> 02:21:59.344
VERY LAUDABLE GOAL. THIS REPORT

02:21:59.410 --> 02:22:02.180
IS ABOUT SUBSTANTIVE MATERIAL

02:22:02.247 --> 02:22:04.482
GAINS FOR CALIFORNIANS. BOTH

02:22:04.549 --> 02:22:06.584
AND LIVELIHOODS AND IN THEIR

02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:08.753
HEALTH STATUS AND WE MONETIZE

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:10.054
THE HEALTH STATUS IN THOSE

02:22:10.121 --> 02:22:11.389
BENEFITS ARE IN THE BILLIONS OF

02:22:11.456 --> 02:22:13.057
DOLLARS I DON'T HAVE TIME TO

02:22:13.124 --> 02:22:15.193
COVER RECOVER ALL THE TABLES.

02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:18.363
BUT VERY SUBSTANTIAL. GAINES IN

02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:20.064
PUBLIC HEALTH JUST AS THE-

02:22:20.131 --> 02:22:21.432
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:23.735
THE WORK WE DID FOR CC SAME

02:22:23.801 --> 02:22:25.904
MESSAGE. DEPLOYING RENEWABLE

02:22:25.970 --> 02:22:28.873
ENERGY REDUCES EMISSIONS WHICH-

02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:30.608
TRANSLATES INTO BILLIONS OF

02:22:30.675 --> 02:22:32.243
DOLLARS AND PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:22:32.310 --> 02:22:35.747
BENEFITS AND IRONICALLY THE

02:22:35.813 --> 02:22:38.283
COST OF THE SAVINGS IN PUBLIC

02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:40.418
HEALTH OF THE OUR PS. ARE

02:22:40.485 --> 02:22:42.120
MATURE SIXTY EIGHT BILLION

02:22:42.186 --> 02:22:43.922
DOLLARS A YEAR ARE COMPARABLE

02:22:43.988 --> 02:22:46.024
TO THE COST OF BUILDING OUT THE

02:22:46.090 --> 02:22:47.592
RPF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY

02:22:47.659 --> 02:22:49.827
SYSTEM. SO YOU CAN JUSTIFY THAT

02:22:49.894 --> 02:22:51.763
DEPLOYMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE

02:22:51.829 --> 02:22:54.499
GAINS OF ALONE WITHOUT ANY

02:22:54.565 --> 02:22:57.035
REFERENCE TO GLOBAL WARMING.

02:22:57.101 --> 02:22:58.703
THE CITY AGAIN THESE ARE

02:22:58.770 --> 02:23:00.071
MATERIAL BENEFITS THE

02:23:00.138 --> 02:23:02.874
CALIFORNIANS NOT THAT NOT LET'S

02:23:02.941 --> 02:23:04.943
GO IT ALONE BECAUSE IT'S THE

02:23:05.009 --> 02:23:05.510
RIGHT THING TO DO IT IS THE

02:23:05.576 --> 02:23:07.078
RIGHT THING TO DO. CALIFORNIA

02:23:07.145 --> 02:23:08.246
IS DOING THE RIGHT THING ON

02:23:08.313 --> 02:23:10.214
CLIMATE. BUT THIS IS THE

02:23:10.281 --> 02:23:13.251
JUSTIFICATION THAT I THINK AN

02:23:13.318 --> 02:23:15.086
ELECTRIC CAN IMMEDIATELY.

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:17.221
APPRECIATE WITH RELATIVELY

02:23:17.288 --> 02:23:19.724
SIMPLE ECONOMIC. CONCEPTS SO

02:23:19.791 --> 02:23:21.426
THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS IN

02:23:21.492 --> 02:23:23.328
THE BILLIONS VERY SUBSTANTIAL

02:23:23.394 --> 02:23:26.164
AND FINALLY- THANKS TO THE

02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:28.700
SUPPORTING CC AND- ALSO THE

02:23:28.766 --> 02:23:30.702
CALIFORNIA IS SO. WE'VE BUILT

02:23:30.768 --> 02:23:33.204
OUR ARE FORECASTING MODELS TO

02:23:33.271 --> 02:23:34.605
INCORPORATE THE CALVET ENVIRO

02:23:34.672 --> 02:23:35.840
SCREEN SYSTEM WHICH IS A

02:23:35.907 --> 02:23:37.675
FANTASTIC DATABASE OF VERY

02:23:37.742 --> 02:23:39.444
DETAILED- DEMOGRAPHIC

02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:41.312
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC

02:23:41.379 --> 02:23:43.815
INFORMATION AND AS YOU CAN SEE

02:23:43.881 --> 02:23:46.250
ON PAGE FOURTEEN WE'RE ABLE TO

02:23:46.317 --> 02:23:48.519
ASSESS THESE IMPACTS JOBS

02:23:48.586 --> 02:23:51.489
INCOMES HEALTH STATUS. ETCETERA

02:23:51.556 --> 02:23:53.891
AT THE CENSUS TRACK LEVEL. AND

02:23:53.958 --> 02:23:55.493
SO WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:56.561
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:23:56.627 --> 02:23:57.962
BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE ARE

02:23:58.029 --> 02:23:59.197
SIGNIFICANT PRIORITY FOR THE

02:23:59.263 --> 02:24:01.099
STATE AND PAGE FIFTEEN YOU'LL

02:24:01.165 --> 02:24:02.467
SEE A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE

02:24:02.533 --> 02:24:04.869
FINDINGS OF MAKING A STINK TION

02:24:04.936 --> 02:24:07.071
BETWEEN DISADVANTAGED OR BACK

02:24:07.138 --> 02:24:08.039
COMMUNE A DISADVANTAGED

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:10.475
COMMUNITIES AND NON TAXES AND

02:24:10.541 --> 02:24:11.643
WHAT WE FIND IS PROPORTIONALLY

02:24:11.709 --> 02:24:13.845
THE JOB BENEFITS ARE GREATER

02:24:13.911 --> 02:24:15.413
FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:16.614
THIS IS WHERE AN ECONOMIST WITH

02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:19.350
CALL PRO POOR THAT IS THE VIEW

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:21.486
THE OPTION IT REGARDLESS OF WHO

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:23.521
BY THE VEHICLES BY JUNE. TV

02:24:23.588 --> 02:24:25.056
DEPLOYMENT WILL STIMULATE THIS

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:26.657
STATE ECONOMY IN A WAY THAT IS

02:24:26.724 --> 02:24:28.726
ESSENTIALLY PRO POOR. THE

02:24:28.793 --> 02:24:30.661
LOWEST 25% OF THE INCOME GROUP

02:24:30.728 --> 02:24:33.297
GETS 36% OF THE JOB GAINS

02:24:33.364 --> 02:24:33.998
BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE SECTOR

02:24:34.065 --> 02:24:35.500
ORIENTATION. OF THE JOB

02:24:35.566 --> 02:24:38.603
CREATION. RIGHT RIGHT AND IF

02:24:38.669 --> 02:24:40.071
THEY BUY THE CARS EVEN BETTER

02:24:40.138 --> 02:24:41.072
BECAUSE THEY'LL GET MORE THE

02:24:41.139 --> 02:24:42.807
LOCAL HEALTH BENEFITS. THAT

02:24:42.874 --> 02:24:44.308
WE'VEI'M AN ARDENT ADVOCATE AS

02:24:44.375 --> 02:24:46.244
THIS- THIS AN INCLUSIVE

02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:47.912
APPROACH TO VEHICLE POLICY.

02:24:47.979 --> 02:24:50.148
BECAUSE THE OF THE HEALTH

02:24:50.214 --> 02:24:52.116
CONSEQUENCES OF TRANSPORT

02:24:52.183 --> 02:24:53.151
MISSIONS ARE VERY UNEQUALLY

02:24:53.217 --> 02:24:54.619
DISTRIBUTED RUN STATE AND I

02:24:54.685 --> 02:24:55.253
KNOW YOU'RE ALL WELL AWARE OF

02:24:55.319 --> 02:24:57.522
THAT. SO THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:24:57.588 --> 02:24:59.157
THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT THE

02:24:59.223 --> 02:25:01.592
JOBS BENEFIT. IT'S POSITIVE FOR

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:03.127
BOOK ACROSS ALMOST ALL

02:25:03.194 --> 02:25:07.765
OCCUPATION CATEGORIES. BUT THE

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:09.434
IN THE IN THE CASE OF THE OF

02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:11.836
THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT IT'S

02:25:11.903 --> 02:25:14.038
AN ABSOLUTE TERMS HIGHER.

02:25:14.105 --> 02:25:15.506
BECAUSE THE BURDEN OF PUBLIC

02:25:15.573 --> 02:25:16.707
HEALTH RISK IS HIGHER IN THE

02:25:16.774 --> 02:25:18.276
LOWER INCOME TO COMMUNITIES

02:25:18.342 --> 02:25:19.243
THEY GET A LARGER ECONOMIC

02:25:19.310 --> 02:25:21.512
BENEFIT MUCH LARGER RELATIVELY

02:25:21.579 --> 02:25:22.713
BUT IN ABSOLUTE TERMSIT'S

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:24.849
LARGER SO THOSE ARE THE MAJOR

02:25:24.916 --> 02:25:27.118
MESSAGES POTENT STIMULUS FOR

02:25:27.185 --> 02:25:28.286
THE ECONOMY IF WE CAN ACHIEVE

02:25:28.352 --> 02:25:30.188
THEM AT THIS REPORT UNFORTUNATE

02:25:30.254 --> 02:25:31.489
CAN'T TELL THE STATE HOW TO

02:25:31.556 --> 02:25:33.091
READ BUT SHE THAT. BUT NOTICE

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:36.127
IF YOU LOOK SORRY ONE LAST

02:25:36.194 --> 02:25:36.727
POINT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MACRO

02:25:36.794 --> 02:25:44.936
RESULTS. WITCHER ON PLEASE SH

02:25:45.002 --> 02:25:50.007
STARTED DANCING AROUND. WELL

02:25:50.074 --> 02:25:51.809
THE SUMMARIZING FOR YOU IF YOU

02:25:51.876 --> 02:25:53.344
LOOK AT THE MACRO RESULTS

02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:55.146
YOU'LL SEE THAT WE ESTIMATE

02:25:55.213 --> 02:25:57.148
FISCAL REVENUE AS A RESULT OF

02:25:57.215 --> 02:26:00.284
THESE SCENARIOS. AND THIS IS

02:26:00.351 --> 02:26:01.552
THE PART THESE POLICIES COULD

02:26:01.619 --> 02:26:02.653
BE QUITE LUCRATIVE FOR THE

02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.188
STATE UP TO EIGHTY TWO BILLION

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:05.323
DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL TAX

02:26:05.389 --> 02:26:07.024
REVENUES THAT IT'S GOING INTO

02:26:07.091 --> 02:26:08.960
GENERAL REVENUE. SO WOULD HAVE

02:26:09.026 --> 02:26:10.394
DID YOU HAVE TO BE A WAY TO

02:26:10.461 --> 02:26:12.597
ALLOCATED BUT AS CHAIR AS CHAIR

02:26:12.663 --> 02:26:15.099
BUT I BELIEVE IS SURE ABOUT BUT

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:15.600
THE S. IN THE BILL SAID

02:26:15.666 --> 02:26:17.835
EARLIER. THE IDEA FINANCING

02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:20.104
SOME OF THESE POLICY

02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:21.973
INITIATIVES WITH BOND. OR

02:26:22.039 --> 02:26:23.875
BARRING INITIATIVE OTHER KINDS

02:26:23.941 --> 02:26:25.209
MAKES PERFECT SENSE IN THIS

02:26:25.276 --> 02:26:26.611
CASE BECAUSE THE BENEFITS WILL

02:26:26.677 --> 02:26:28.913
BE REALIZE FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:31.215
BUT THERE'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL.

02:26:31.282 --> 02:26:32.650
THE STATE REVENUE GAINS WILL BE

02:26:32.717 --> 02:26:35.386
VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR- AS A

02:26:35.453 --> 02:26:37.221
RESULT OF THE STIMULUS THAT

02:26:37.288 --> 02:26:39.290
COMES FROM- FROM DEPLOYING

02:26:39.357 --> 02:26:40.791
THESE VEHICLES THANK YOU VERY

02:26:40.858 --> 02:26:43.728
MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU.

02:26:43.794 --> 02:26:45.730
WHAT'S THE POINT WHERE. ALRIGHT

02:26:45.796 --> 02:26:47.465
LET'S NOW TURN TO PROFESSOR AND

02:26:47.532 --> 02:26:49.567
HIS COLLEAGUES AT DAVIS AUSTIN

02:26:49.634 --> 02:26:50.434
BROWN IS DIRECTOR OF YOU SEE

02:26:50.501 --> 02:26:52.036
GIVES POLICIES TO FOR ENERGY

02:26:52.103 --> 02:26:53.871
ENVIRONMENT AND THE ECONOMY.

02:26:53.938 --> 02:26:54.672
THANKS FOR THANKS SO MUCH FOR

02:26:54.739 --> 02:26:55.673
HAVING I'M AWARE WERE RUNNING A

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:57.208
LITTLE SHORT ON TIME SO TRY TO

02:26:57.275 --> 02:26:58.376
KEEP MYSELF BRIEF THAT'S NOT A

02:26:58.442 --> 02:26:59.877
CHARACTERISTIC I'M WELL KNOWN

02:26:59.944 --> 02:27:01.112
FOR BUT I WILL DO MY LEVEL

02:27:01.179 --> 02:27:03.414
BEST- SERVICING THE POLICY

02:27:03.481 --> 02:27:05.016
INSTITUTE POLITICIANS AND

02:27:05.082 --> 02:27:07.285
PROFESSORS. BUT I THE PROBLEMS%

02:27:07.351 --> 02:27:07.885
RIGHT HAVE YOU EVER FIND

02:27:07.952 --> 02:27:09.754
PROFESSOR TURNED POLITICIAN

02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:12.523
IT'S I THINK EE SO THE POLICIES

02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:14.091
TO WHICH A DIRECT- EXISTS TO

02:27:14.158 --> 02:27:15.526
HELP CONNECT OUR RESEARCH

02:27:15.593 --> 02:27:16.861
ECOSYSTEM INTO THE POLICY

02:27:16.928 --> 02:27:17.995
PROCESS REALLY TWO MECHANISMS

02:27:18.062 --> 02:27:20.464
LIKE THIS- AND AS AS THE-

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:21.832
SENATE BILL SAID WE TRY NOT TO.

02:27:21.899 --> 02:27:23.968
SIT ON ACADEMIC BOOKSHELVES SO

02:27:24.035 --> 02:27:24.635
OUR GOAL IS REALLY TO HELP

02:27:24.702 --> 02:27:25.803
COMMUNICATE THE RESEARCH

02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:26.871
BECAUSE SYSTEM AND BRING THAT

02:27:26.938 --> 02:27:27.939
TO MAKE IT USEFUL FOR YOU FOR

02:27:28.005 --> 02:27:29.273
YOU AND IN CONDUCTING OUR JOB.

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:30.908
THAT'S WHERE HERE THAT'S WHY

02:27:30.975 --> 02:27:33.144
I'M HERE- AND IT'S REALLY BORN

02:27:33.211 --> 02:27:33.978
TO DO SO TRANSPORTATION HAVE

02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:35.446
DISCUSSED IN PARTICULAR HARD TO

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:37.315
ADDRESS- AND IT'S ALSO REALLY

02:27:37.381 --> 02:27:38.416
HARD TO ADDRESS JUST FOR THE

02:27:38.482 --> 02:27:38.916
CARBON PRICE THE SIMPLE

02:27:38.983 --> 02:27:40.618
MECHANISM. A GOOD WAY TO SEE

02:27:40.685 --> 02:27:42.520
THIS IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO GET

02:27:42.587 --> 02:27:43.387
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A TONNE

02:27:43.454 --> 02:27:44.322
CARBON PRICE WHICH NOBODY'S

02:27:44.388 --> 02:27:45.223
TALKING ABOUT. THAT WOULD

02:27:45.289 --> 02:27:46.891
TRANSLATE TO ABOUT A DOLLAR A

02:27:46.958 --> 02:27:49.126
GALLON GASOLINE- AND THAT'S

02:27:49.193 --> 02:27:50.494
JUST NOT A BIG ENOUGH NOW TO

02:27:50.561 --> 02:27:51.429
MOVE PEOPLE FOR SIGNIFICANTLY

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:53.631
WE SEEN DOLLARS A GALLON SPIKES

02:27:53.698 --> 02:27:55.266
IN GAS PRICES PEOPLE CHANGE

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:56.834
THEIR BEHAVIOR IF YO PERCENT-

02:27:56.901 --> 02:27:57.969
SUCH A GOOD WAY TO SEE WHY WE

02:27:58.035 --> 02:27:59.670
HAVE THIS. ONE REASON HAVE THIS

02:27:59.737 --> 02:28:01.672
ROBUST SET OF COMPANY POLICIES

02:28:01.739 --> 02:28:02.807
TO KICKSTART SOME OF THE

02:28:02.873 --> 02:28:04.308
CHANGES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING-

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:05.643
SIGNAL CALIFORNIA'S LEADING ON

02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:06.811
MANY OF THESE POLICIES AS WE'VE

02:28:06.877 --> 02:28:08.279
HEARD ABOUT. WE ARE NOT ON

02:28:08.346 --> 02:28:11.415
TRACK TO MEET OUR GOALS- ANDS-

02:28:11.482 --> 02:28:13.351
NEED TO BE LOOKING MUCH MORE

02:28:13.417 --> 02:28:14.852
AT- WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT LOOK

02:28:14.919 --> 02:28:17.521
LIKE- SO. AND THEN AT THE SAME

02:28:17.588 --> 02:28:19.423
TIME WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK MORE-

02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:20.491
AGGRESSIVELY AT REDUCE OUR

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:21.325
MISSIONS THAT WE THOUGHT WE

02:28:21.392 --> 02:28:24.428
NEED TO BEFORE NOW WITH A GOAL

02:28:24.495 --> 02:28:25.696
NEUTRALITY ON THE TWENTY FORTY

02:28:25.763 --> 02:28:26.764
FIVE TIME FRAME WHICH IS.

02:28:26.831 --> 02:28:27.632
FASTER THAN WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:28:27.698 --> 02:28:30.134
CREDIBLE STUDIES EXPLORING SO

02:28:30.201 --> 02:28:31.002
FAR I MEAN THAT'S AN

02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:32.136
APPROPRIATE GOAL BASED ON

02:28:32.203 --> 02:28:33.571
CLIMATE SCIENCE AND BASED ON ON

02:28:33.638 --> 02:28:35.072
THE HEALTH AND- CONGESTION

02:28:35.139 --> 02:28:37.041
CRISES WERE IN AS WELL- BUT WE

02:28:37.108 --> 02:28:38.709
SHOULD BE CLEAR EYED ASIDE

02:28:38.776 --> 02:28:39.510
SENATOR STARK SAID. ABOUT THE

02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:41.112
SCALE THE CHALLENGE THAT WERE

02:28:41.178 --> 02:28:42.513
FACING. UP I'M GONNA TRY TO

02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:44.415
SUMMARIZE A REALLY HUGE MATTER

02:28:44.482 --> 02:28:46.183
OF RESEARCH IN JUST A FEW

02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:50.688
POINTS AND THAT MEANS THAT. A

02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:52.290
LOT OF TELLING AT LEAST. ONE

02:28:52.356 --> 02:28:53.324
HAPPY TO WORK WITH. I WITH YOUR

02:28:53.391 --> 02:28:55.960
OFFICE IS GOING FOR DENISE THIS.

02:28:56.027 --> 02:28:57.662
SO I LIKE TO. AT HOME THE A-

02:28:57.728 --> 02:28:59.163
THE- AMATEUR CHEF AND SO I THE

02:28:59.230 --> 02:28:59.764
ABOUT ALL THESE. IN TERMS OF

02:28:59.830 --> 02:29:01.098
WHAT WE WANT TO PUT TOGETHER AS-

02:29:01.165 --> 02:29:04.335
RECIPE'S INGREDIENTS- AND TO

02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:05.636
THE INGREDIENTS. OF A- CARBON

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:06.837
CARBON FREE TRANSPORTATION

02:29:06.904 --> 02:29:07.772
SYSTEM. I THINK A PRETTY WELL

02:29:07.838 --> 02:29:09.807
KNOWN BY NOW- NOW. ARE

02:29:09.874 --> 02:29:11.108
COMMUNICATIONS PEOPLE TELL ME

02:29:11.175 --> 02:29:12.743
TO LIMIT- THE NUMBERS OF LISTS

02:29:12.810 --> 02:29:14.645
I GIVE TO. ITEMS OF THREE OR

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:17.114
FEWER- I THINK I MEAN OPERATE

02:29:17.181 --> 02:29:17.848
IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. THERE

02:29:17.915 --> 02:29:19.250
LEGISLATORS ARE TO AT LEAST

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:20.184
TWICE AS GOOD AT KEEPING.

02:29:20.251 --> 02:29:21.552
INFORMATION IS. THE GENERAL

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:23.521
PUBLIC'S I'VE LIMITED MYSELF TO

02:29:23.587 --> 02:29:24.555
SIX WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE HOW WE

02:29:24.622 --> 02:29:26.757
GO WITH THAT- SO NUMBER ONE IF

02:29:26.824 --> 02:29:27.558
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. QUITE A

02:29:27.625 --> 02:29:29.160
BIT BEFORE AND SO I WON'T GO

02:29:29.226 --> 02:29:30.227
INTO DETAIL IS MITIGATING

02:29:30.294 --> 02:29:31.796
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND

02:29:31.862 --> 02:29:33.130
INCREASING I'M TRANSPORTATION

02:29:33.197 --> 02:29:34.699
MODE CHOICE. WITH OUR PLANNING

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:36.267
INVESTMENT- WE TALKED ABOUT

02:29:36.334 --> 02:29:38.035
WAS. DR HANDY TALKS IN GREAT.

02:29:38.102 --> 02:29:40.004
GREAT ELOQUENCE ABOUT THE NEED

02:29:40.071 --> 02:29:41.639
TO DO THIS. AND IN PARTICULAR

02:29:41.706 --> 02:29:42.306
THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT NEW

02:29:42.373 --> 02:29:43.541
MOBILITY. A WHICH HAS BEEN

02:29:43.607 --> 02:29:44.775
RAPIDLY SERVICES LIKE UBER

02:29:44.842 --> 02:29:47.845
LIFT- ARE SHARED AND- SUPPORT.

02:29:47.912 --> 02:29:49.380
RATHER THAN COMPETE. OUT

02:29:49.447 --> 02:29:52.049
TRANSIT. ON THIS STILL I THINK

02:29:52.116 --> 02:29:54.318
HAS A HUGE ROLE EVEN IF WE OVER

02:29:54.385 --> 02:29:56.287
PERFORMING ELECTRIFICATION. AND

02:29:56.354 --> 02:29:56.754
CLEAN UP THE VEHICLES

02:29:56.821 --> 02:29:59.156
THEMSELVES WILL CALL. IN HER ON.

02:29:59.223 --> 02:30:01.025
TO CHALLENGES. YES ACCESS.

02:30:01.092 --> 02:30:03.327
HEALTH FROM ACTIVE TRADE. ALL

02:30:03.394 --> 02:30:05.029
BENEFIT FROM A MORE DIVERSE SET

02:30:05.096 --> 02:30:06.430
OF CHOICES AND GETTING BEYOND

02:30:06.497 --> 02:30:08.399
THE- SINGLE OCCUPANT CAR. ON A

02:30:08.466 --> 02:30:12.002
CULTURE- THE NUMBER. TWO IS THE

02:30:12.069 --> 02:30:13.170
FULL ELECTRIFICATION OF LIGHT

02:30:13.237 --> 02:30:14.038
DUTY VEHICLES AS SOON AS

02:30:14.105 --> 02:30:17.074
POSSIBLE- THIS. IS A GOOD OPEN

02:30:17.141 --> 02:30:18.976
QUESTION ABOUT HOW. LONG WILL

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:20.611
NEED. A MULTI. FUEL VEHICLES

02:30:20.678 --> 02:30:22.813
LIKE PLUG IN HYBRIDS. ON YOU

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:25.116
CAN. FOR MORE. SO NEEDS. EVER

02:30:25.182 --> 02:30:29.687
THE SOURCE. VEHICLE MAKE IT.

02:30:29.754 --> 02:30:31.422
WE'RE SO. A BIT SLOW IN THE-

02:30:31.489 --> 02:30:32.556
CAN EVEN WE SEEN MILLION.

02:30:32.623 --> 02:30:33.691
AUGUST ON THE TECHNOLOGY AND

02:30:33.758 --> 02:30:40.731
PRODUCED DIRECTIONS. OF. THE

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:42.767
CITY VEHICLES. I'M AT THE SAME

02:30:42.833 --> 02:30:44.201
TIME. NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:30:44.268 --> 02:30:46.704
WE HAVE TO BETTER EQUITY FOR.

02:30:46.771 --> 02:30:47.538
JUST STARTING TO SEE YOU CAR

02:30:47.605 --> 02:30:48.706
MARK. SO THE GOING TO BE REALLY

02:30:48.773 --> 02:30:49.573
OPTION GET A LOT VEHICLES INTO.

02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:51.208
THE THAT NEED MOST WHICH OF THE

02:30:51.275 --> 02:30:51.842
LOWER INCOME. THAT OFTEN DON'T.

02:30:51.909 --> 02:30:52.376
GOOD ACCESS TO TRANSFER.

02:30:52.443 --> 02:30:54.545
SERVICES AND ALSO AS AS

02:30:54.612 --> 02:30:56.347
RESTAURANT HOLE SAID WHAT WOULD

02:30:56.414 --> 02:30:57.281
BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THOSE AIR

02:30:57.348 --> 02:30:58.449
QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS OF GTTING

02:30:58.516 --> 02:30:59.417
THOSE EASE INTO THEIR

02:30:59.483 --> 02:31:00.718
COMMUNITIES. HAS BEEN A REALLY

02:31:00.785 --> 02:31:02.887
IMPORTANT TIME FOR THAT. USED

02:31:02.953 --> 02:31:04.955
VEHICLE MARKET. TO BE ON LIKE

02:31:05.022 --> 02:31:06.757
THE VEHICLE IS ALSO LOOKING AT

02:31:06.824 --> 02:31:07.525
FULL RECTIFICATION OF MEDIUM

02:31:07.591 --> 02:31:09.193
DUTY DELIVERY. DRAINAGE AND

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:10.928
TRANSIT VEHICLES THESE VEHICLES

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:13.063
HAVE DUTY CYCLES THAT ARE

02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:13.697
INCREDIBLY- WELL ALIGNED WITH

02:31:13.764 --> 02:31:14.999
ELECTRIFICATION. THEY DON'T

02:31:15.065 --> 02:31:17.101
DRIVE. TOO FAR TO BE SUITABLE

02:31:17.168 --> 02:31:18.569
FOR A BATTERY APPLICATION. AND

02:31:18.636 --> 02:31:19.670
THEY ALSO HAVE HUGE LOCAL AIR

02:31:19.737 --> 02:31:20.905
QUALITY BENEFITS BECAUSE

02:31:20.971 --> 02:31:21.672
THEY'RE OPERATING RIGHT IN

02:31:21.739 --> 02:31:23.974
THOSE MARKETS- WHICH ARE MOST

02:31:24.041 --> 02:31:26.343
VULNERABLE- THE NUMBER FOUR IS

02:31:26.410 --> 02:31:28.145
A SLIGHT CONTRAST. NEED NOT

02:31:28.212 --> 02:31:29.647
NECESSARILY FULL OF VACATION

02:31:29.713 --> 02:31:30.915
BUT AS MUCH LIKE FOR CATIONS

02:31:30.981 --> 02:31:32.983
POSSIBLE. OF LONG HAUL A HEAVY

02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:34.685
DUTY FREE VEHICLES. I THINK AS

02:31:34.752 --> 02:31:35.753
MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THESE

02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:37.655
TEND TO HAVE LONGER DUTY CYCLES

02:31:37.721 --> 02:31:39.723
TRAVEL VERY LONG DISTANCES- AND

02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:42.259
SO- MAYBE- H. MORE CHALLENGING

02:31:42.326 --> 02:31:43.861
MARKET- AND MAY ALSO BE GOOD

02:31:43.928 --> 02:31:44.795
APPLICATION FEEL SUCH

02:31:44.862 --> 02:31:46.363
TECHNOLOGIES IF BATTERY-

02:31:46.430 --> 02:31:48.065
PROGRESS FLATTENS OUT- IN THE

02:31:48.132 --> 02:31:49.133
NEAR FUTURE. IT'S STILL

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:50.134
POSSIBLE THOUGH THAT BATTERIES

02:31:50.201 --> 02:31:50.901
WILL BE ABLE TO TRUST THOSE

02:31:50.968 --> 02:31:51.902
IT'S JUST WE HAVE LESS

02:31:51.969 --> 02:31:53.671
CONFIDENCE IN THE MEDIUM DUTY.

02:31:53.737 --> 02:31:55.606
AND MORE LOCAL DELIVERY. ON

02:31:55.673 --> 02:31:58.409
VEHICLES. NUMBER FIVE IS THE-

02:31:58.476 --> 02:32:00.945
ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:01.712
TO SUPPORT ALL OF THESE NEWMAN.

02:32:01.779 --> 02:32:03.414
PLEASE BE ALL THESE NEW MODES.

02:32:03.481 --> 02:32:04.748
I'M SO FOR PERSONALLY OWNED

02:32:04.815 --> 02:32:05.583
VEHICLES WE KNOW THAT MOST OF

02:32:05.649 --> 02:32:07.418
CHARGING WILL BE WALL AT HOME

02:32:07.485 --> 02:32:09.854
AND WALL AT WORK. NUMBER TWO-

02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:11.255
I'M INTENSE BUT SAYING WALL AT

02:32:11.322 --> 02:32:12.923
HOME RATHER THAN AT HOME. AS WE

02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:15.392
MOVE BEYOND PEOPLE WITH GARAGES

02:32:15.459 --> 02:32:15.993
OWNING THESE VEHICLES WE NEED

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:17.328
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. SUPPORT

02:32:17.394 --> 02:32:18.262
THEIR CHARGING WHILE THEY ARE

02:32:18.329 --> 02:32:19.597
AT HOME WITH THIS IN A MULTI

02:32:19.663 --> 02:32:21.599
FAMILY. DWELLING OR AWAY FROM

02:32:21.665 --> 02:32:23.334
THEIR- OR ON THE STREET OR WE

02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:25.836
FROM THEIR ACTUAL HOME. AND

02:32:25.903 --> 02:32:28.072
WHILE AT WORK BE ABLE TO CHARGE

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:29.773
THERE IS A NUMBER TWO. NUMBER

02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:31.141
ONE OPTION FOR THOSE A- CHART

02:32:31.208 --> 02:32:31.709
BUT HOME. FOR PUBLIC CHARTER

02:32:31.775 --> 02:32:33.444
STILL HAS A ROLE OF FOR

02:32:33.511 --> 02:32:35.112
IMPROMPTU CHARGING AND- THE

02:32:35.179 --> 02:32:41.552
BILL SOME CONFIDENCE. ON NEARLY

02:32:41.619 --> 02:32:43.020
CHARGING. OUT ACTUAL US OF

02:32:43.087 --> 02:32:44.188
STATIONS. THAT WHEN YOU START

02:32:44.255 --> 02:32:45.189
LOOK AT THE NEW. A USE OF LIKE

02:32:45.256 --> 02:32:46.490
VEHICLES. FOR WERE ARE SEEING

02:32:46.557 --> 02:32:47.858
WITH UBER LIFT THAT MUCH HIGHER.

02:32:47.925 --> 02:32:49.693
ON CHARGING. AND SO CITIES NEED

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:50.528
TO GET AHEAD OF THAT AND THINK

02:32:50.594 --> 02:32:51.762
ABOUT. HOW TO BUILD A CHARGING

02:32:51.829 --> 02:32:53.163
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS

02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:54.965
THE GOOD APPLICATIONS OF THESE-

02:32:55.032 --> 02:32:56.834
OF THESE NEW ABILITY FLEETS AND

02:32:56.901 --> 02:32:57.868
ALLOWS THEM TO ELECTRIFY MORE

02:32:57.935 --> 02:33:00.671
RAPIDLY- THEY WOULD OTHERWISE.

02:33:00.738 --> 02:33:01.272
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:33:01.338 --> 02:33:02.339
ALL OF THIS TURNING

02:33:02.406 --> 02:33:02.973
INFRASTRUCTURE INTEGRATES WELL

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:05.242
WITH THE GRID- AND I KNOW THIS

02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:06.043
IS BEING CONSIDERED BY SOME

02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.944
OTHER COMMITTEES A LEGISLATURE

02:33:07.011 --> 02:33:08.712
BUT- THINKING AHEAD ABOUT HOW

02:33:08.779 --> 02:33:09.713
TO USE. TRANSPORTATION CHARGING

02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:10.714
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:33:10.781 --> 02:33:12.016
INCORPORATE MORE HIGH LEVELS OF

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:13.851
IN THE WINTER G. RATHER THAN AS

02:33:13.918 --> 02:33:14.919
A RISK FACTOR. WE CAN ACTUALLY

02:33:14.985 --> 02:33:16.787
FORGET THE POLICIES RIGHT- HELP

02:33:16.854 --> 02:33:18.155
SUPPORT OUR NEW ENERGY GOALS

02:33:18.222 --> 02:33:19.757
AND THE STABILITY THE GREAT AT

02:33:19.823 --> 02:33:21.759
THE SAME TIME AS WE MOVE TO

02:33:21.825 --> 02:33:22.326
ELECTRIFICATION. I'M IN MY

02:33:22.393 --> 02:33:24.361
FINAL. A NUMBER SIX INGREDIENT

02:33:24.428 --> 02:33:26.096
IS ADVANCED RENEWABLE LIQUID

02:33:26.163 --> 02:33:27.064
FUELS FOR THE REMAINDER AND

02:33:27.131 --> 02:33:28.899
THIS GETS TO THE- AIRCRAFT AS

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:29.600
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER

02:33:29.667 --> 02:33:31.035
AS WELL AS MARINE APPLICATIONS.

02:33:31.101 --> 02:33:31.869
THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY

02:33:31.936 --> 02:33:33.571
CHALLENGING TO- TO MOVE TO

02:33:33.637 --> 02:33:36.006
ELECTRIFICATION- FEELS MAY BE A

02:33:36.073 --> 02:33:37.241
GOOD WAY TO GET AHEAD OF THIS.

02:33:37.308 --> 02:33:38.175
AND WE NEED TO BE THINKING IN

02:33:38.242 --> 02:33:39.176
ADVANCE ABOUT SOME TRULY LOWER

02:33:39.243 --> 02:33:40.678
CARBON FUELS. THAT AREN'T

02:33:40.744 --> 02:33:42.079
REALLY IN THE MARKET YET. SO

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:43.480
THOSE ARE SIX INGREDIENTS THIS

02:33:43.547 --> 02:33:44.515
ALSO MEANS THAT ARE OTHER

02:33:44.582 --> 02:33:45.716
OPTIONS THAT. SORT OF LOOK

02:33:45.783 --> 02:33:47.451
APPEALING AT THE BEGINNING BUT-

02:33:47.518 --> 02:33:49.186
JUST BASED ON THE- LONG TERM

02:33:49.253 --> 02:33:50.254
RESEARCH. WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:33:50.321 --> 02:33:51.288
CHALLENGE BEING A PART OF THE

02:33:51.355 --> 02:33:52.756
FUTURE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.

02:33:52.823 --> 02:33:54.992
SETS TECHNOLOGIES LIKE INTERNAL

02:33:55.059 --> 02:33:55.593
COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES FOR

02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:57.394
LIKE TWO VEHICLES. I EVEN IF

02:33:57.461 --> 02:33:58.262
YOU GET THE MORE EFFICIENT

02:33:58.329 --> 02:33:59.797
THERE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AN

02:33:59.863 --> 02:34:01.832
80% OR MORE REDUCTION- WE

02:34:01.899 --> 02:34:02.967
DEFINITELY CAN'T CONTINUE

02:34:03.033 --> 02:34:04.802
BUSINESS AS USUAL. AS WE BUILD.

02:34:04.868 --> 02:34:06.403
HOUSING AND INVEST IN TRANSIT

02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:07.404
WE NEED TO BE THINKING VERY

02:34:07.471 --> 02:34:08.238
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE-

02:34:08.305 --> 02:34:09.506
INVESTMENT PATTERNS WE'VE

02:34:09.573 --> 02:34:10.641
DOING. DISCUSSED A LOT SO I

02:34:10.708 --> 02:34:12.543
WILL MOVE. MOVE THROUGH THAT

02:34:12.610 --> 02:34:14.545
WOULD QUICKLY- WE ALSO NEED TO.

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:16.647
LOOK VERY CRITICALLY AT EFFORTS

02:34:16.714 --> 02:34:18.015
TO INCORPORATE NOTHING HOUSTON

02:34:18.082 --> 02:34:20.217
TRANSPORTATION- AND THERE'S

02:34:20.284 --> 02:34:20.985
JUST NO APPLICATION OF FOSSEL

02:34:21.051 --> 02:34:23.420
GAS- OTHER THAN WITH VERY HIGH

02:34:23.487 --> 02:34:24.855
LEVELS OF CARBON CAPTURED AT A-

02:34:24.922 --> 02:34:25.923
ELECTRIC. GENERATION PLANT.

02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:27.124
THAT'S PROBABLY PERCENT

02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:31.195
REDUCTIONS- RULE MATCH GOT DOES

02:34:31.261 --> 02:34:33.464
IT DEFINITELY VIABLE LOW CARB.

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:34.298
FUEL SPEAK SUPPORTED

02:34:34.365 --> 02:34:35.733
APPROPRIATELY BUT WILL COVER

02:34:35.799 --> 02:34:37.434
FUELS. ANDERSON CENTER THE

02:34:37.501 --> 02:34:39.970
TOTAL PLY. MUCH LOW. AND WOULD

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:41.205
BE NEEDED JUST FOR. THE CURRENT.

02:34:41.271 --> 02:34:44.908
AFTER GAS IN A SECTORS. NO WAY

02:34:44.975 --> 02:34:45.409
FOR TO SCALE UP TO MEET.

02:34:45.476 --> 02:34:45.943
SIGNATURE PORTION PASSED.

02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:47.478
YOU'LL I'M JUST BASED ON THE

02:34:47.544 --> 02:34:49.747
RESOURCES. AND THAT'S WELL. IN

02:34:49.813 --> 02:34:55.753
NOT. AS FAR AS AN SUBJECT.

02:34:55.819 --> 02:34:57.421
REPORTS WE HAVE ON THE TOP.

02:34:57.488 --> 02:34:58.222
UNCONVENTIONAL BUT RENEWABLE

02:34:58.288 --> 02:35:00.157
WALLS AFTER FOR A VENN THE

02:35:00.224 --> 02:35:02.026
PHASE OUT THINGS START A AT THE

02:35:02.092 --> 02:35:02.593
FOR AND POTENTIAL BODY VERY

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:04.461
BRIDGE IN THE IMPORTANT TO OF

02:35:04.528 --> 02:35:06.263
LIQUID FUEL. BUT THEY THOSE

02:35:06.330 --> 02:35:07.264
EARLY TECHNOLOGIES TO CAN'T GET

02:35:07.331 --> 02:35:08.866
TO CUSTOMERS RUSSIAN. I'M IN

02:35:08.932 --> 02:35:09.366
THE LAST WE CAN'T GO TO

02:35:09.433 --> 02:35:10.501
AUTOMATE POLICY BLIND CAN'T

02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:11.502
JUST AUTOMATE THESE. AND AS

02:35:11.568 --> 02:35:14.004
SOON SOUL OF OUR AS THE DOCTOR

02:35:14.071 --> 02:35:15.305
HAD HE SAID WE REALLY NEED TO

02:35:15.372 --> 02:35:16.807
THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS- FROM

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:18.676
HOW TO INCREASE THEIR BENEFITS

02:35:18.742 --> 02:35:20.010
SUPPORT POOLING SHARING

02:35:20.077 --> 02:35:22.012
ELECTRIFICATION- AND THE CLEAN

02:35:22.079 --> 02:35:23.781
MILE STANDARD ON THAT CHAIR

02:35:23.847 --> 02:35:25.482
NICHOLS MENTIONED EARLIER IS A

02:35:25.549 --> 02:35:26.350
REALLY IMPORTANT POLICY OOL

02:35:26.417 --> 02:35:27.885
HERE. OKAY SO WE KNOW ALL THOSE

02:35:27.951 --> 02:35:28.752
INGREDIENTS AND WHAT'S THE

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:30.487
RECIPE HOW MUCH OF EACH OF

02:35:30.554 --> 02:35:31.388
THESE I DON'T THINK WE KNOW ANY

02:35:31.455 --> 02:35:32.990
OF THAT YET EXACTLY NUMBER WE

02:35:33.057 --> 02:35:34.425
DON'T HAVE TO GET STARTED I'M

02:35:34.491 --> 02:35:35.659
HAVE TO DO OUR BEST AND JUST AS

02:35:35.726 --> 02:35:38.028
WE GO ALONG BUT YOU KNOW SOME

02:35:38.095 --> 02:35:38.595
TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO FIGURE

02:35:38.662 --> 02:35:40.631
THIS ALL OUT IT'S NOT A LOT OF

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:42.633
TIME AND- RATIFIED STATE IS

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:43.701
MOVING FORWARD A LEADERSHIP

02:35:43.767 --> 02:35:45.836
POSITION- AND TRY TO TAKE ON

02:35:45.903 --> 02:35:47.204
THESE INCREDIBLY TOUGH.

02:35:47.271 --> 02:35:48.906
CHALLENGES THE LAST POINT I'LL

02:35:48.972 --> 02:35:50.541
MENTION IS THAT THE- YOU SEE IN

02:35:50.607 --> 02:35:52.142
SUITS OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES

02:35:52.209 --> 02:35:53.677
ARE STARTING A CONFERENCE OF

02:35:53.744 --> 02:35:55.546
FOR CAMPUS STUDY NOW- WHICH IS

02:35:55.612 --> 02:35:56.580
FUNDED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR

02:35:56.647 --> 02:35:57.948
LOOKING AT THESE COMBINED

02:35:58.015 --> 02:36:00.617
SCENARIOS FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY

02:36:00.684 --> 02:36:01.251
TWENTY FORTY FIVE THAT WILL BE

02:36:01.318 --> 02:36:02.419
FIRST OF KIND STUDY WE'VE NEVER

02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:05.055
HAD A- ROBUST ACADEMIC STUDY

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:06.890
LOOKING AT A D. CONVERSATION

02:36:06.957 --> 02:36:11.528
SCENARIO THAT. AND THAT DEEP

02:36:11.595 --> 02:36:15.766
AND WHAT IS ASKED TO PROVIDE

02:36:15.833 --> 02:36:18.969

TECHNOLOGIES ALTERNATE. MODES

02:37:35.345 --> 02:37:37.114
THE TREND IS WORRISOME. BUT

02:37:37.181 --> 02:37:39.283
LOST IN THE HEADLINES OF

OUR AFFINITY FOR OUR CARS. IS

02:37:42.686 --> 02:37:43.687
THE REALITY THAT MANY OF THE

KEY STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING

02:37:44.988 --> 02:37:46.924
TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. AND

02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:48.125
SIMPLE AND SUPPORTING PUBLIC

02:37:48.192 --> 02:37:51.895
TRANSIT OPERATIONS. HAVE SELDOM

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:52.863
BEEN PURSUED. IN CALIFORNIA.

02:37:52.930 --> 02:37:54.598
THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE AND THE

02:37:54.665 --> 02:37:56.166
ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE FROM

02:37:56.233 --> 02:37:58.335
SEATTLE PORTLAND HOUSTON AND

02:37:58.402 --> 02:38:00.504
SACRAMENTO CITIES WHERE TRANSIT

02:38:00.571 --> 02:38:02.539
RIDERSHIP IS RISING IS CLEAR.

02:38:02.606 --> 02:38:04.308
WE CAN TAKE CARS OFF THE ROAD

02:38:04.374 --> 02:38:06.176
AN INCREASE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP

02:38:06.243 --> 02:38:07.511
WHEN TRADITIONAL TRANSIT

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:09.913
SERVICE IS FAST CONVENIENT

02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:11.849
FREQUENT RELIABLE AND COST

02:38:11.915 --> 02:38:14.518
COMPETITIVE. AND YOU MAY SAY

02:38:14.585 --> 02:38:16.119
GREAT THE STATE PROVIDES

02:38:16.186 --> 02:38:17.221
TRANSIT AGENCIES WITH

02:38:17.287 --> 02:38:18.789
SIGNIFICANT FUNDING NOW SO DO

02:38:18.856 --> 02:38:21.692
EXACTLY THAT. IT'S A HERE THAT

02:38:21.758 --> 02:38:23.160
IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

02:38:23.227 --> 02:38:24.528
THAT THERE ARE SOME STRATEGIES

02:38:24.595 --> 02:38:26.496
THAT TRANSIT AGENCIES CAN AND

02:38:26.563 --> 02:38:28.765
SHOULD PURSUE THEMSELVES AND

02:38:28.832 --> 02:38:31.335
OTHERS THAT WE DAYS SIMPLY HAVE

02:38:31.401 --> 02:38:33.737
NO CONTROL OVER. TRANSLATION

02:38:33.804 --> 02:38:35.305
SEES CAN CONDUCT OPERATIONAL

02:38:35.372 --> 02:38:37.107
ANALYSES TO ASSESS AND RECAST

02:38:37.174 --> 02:38:38.442
THEIR SERVICE NETWORKS BASED ON

02:38:38.508 --> 02:38:40.310
CHANGING DEMO DEMOGRAPHICS

02:38:40.377 --> 02:38:42.079
SERVICE NEEDS SHIFTING

02:38:42.145 --> 02:38:43.513
POPULATION ETCETERA. AND

02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:44.882
SEVERAL CALIFORNIA TRANSIT

02:38:44.948 --> 02:38:46.550
AGENCIES HAVE HAVE CONDUCTED

02:38:46.617 --> 02:38:47.851
ARE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

02:38:47.918 --> 02:38:49.820
CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES WE'VE

02:38:49.887 --> 02:38:51.221
DONE THIS IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH

02:38:51.288 --> 02:38:53.657
OUR MUNY FORWARD PROJECT REALLY

02:38:53.724 --> 02:38:55.626
WE REALIZE THAT 75% OF OUR

02:38:55.692 --> 02:38:57.194
RIDERSHIP IS ON THIRTEEN OF OUR

02:38:57.261 --> 02:38:59.096
PRIMARY ROUTES. AND YET WE

02:38:59.162 --> 02:39:01.164
OPERATE OVER HUNDRED ROUTES SO

02:39:01.231 --> 02:39:02.165
TRYING TO LOOK AT HOW TO

02:39:02.232 --> 02:39:04.601
PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE MORE

02:39:04.668 --> 02:39:05.168
EFFICIENTLY WHERE THE MOST

02:39:05.235 --> 02:39:07.404
DEMAND IS A KEY PART OF THE

02:39:07.471 --> 02:39:09.172
BUSINESS PROVIDING A BETTER

02:39:09.239 --> 02:39:11.842
PRODUCT. IN SAN DIEGO WITH

02:39:11.909 --> 02:39:14.444
SIMILAR WORK THEY SAW ONE POINT

02:39:14.511 --> 02:39:15.812
4% RIDERSHIP INCREASED OVER THE

02:39:15.879 --> 02:39:18.715
LAST YEAR IN SACRAMENTO A SIX

02:39:18.782 --> 02:39:22.886
POINT 35% WRITER IN IN THE

02:39:22.953 --> 02:39:25.989
QUARTER TWO NINETY. ADDITIONAL

02:39:26.056 --> 02:39:27.658
NINE LIGHT. THAT WOULD PROVIDE

02:39:27.724 --> 02:39:28.959
ON SB ONE THE STATE'S ONGOING

02:39:29.026 --> 02:39:30.560
ABOUT OF GREEN GAS FOR. FUNDS

02:39:30.627 --> 02:39:31.695
WE CAN INCREASE SERVICE LEVELS

02:39:31.762 --> 02:39:33.630
AND BE CAPACITY ADVANCE

02:39:33.697 --> 02:39:35.165
TARGETED FOR REDUCTIONS IN

02:39:35.232 --> 02:39:37.334
REHAB OUR VEHICLES. THAT IS TO

02:39:37.401 --> 02:39:39.369
MAKE THE DIRECT INVESTMENTS

02:39:39.436 --> 02:39:40.904
THAT WE KNOW WILL REDUCE

02:39:40.971 --> 02:39:42.039
EMISSIONS DIRECTLY FROM

02:39:42.105 --> 02:39:44.141
TRANSIT. AND THAT HELP MAKE

02:39:44.207 --> 02:39:46.043
TRANSIT MORE COMPETITIVE WITH

02:39:46.109 --> 02:39:48.078
AUTO TRAVEL. TO PUT A FINER

02:39:48.145 --> 02:39:49.746
POINT ON IT CALIFORNIA'S

02:39:49.813 --> 02:39:51.381
INVESTMENTS IN THE TRANSIT AND

02:39:51.448 --> 02:39:53.417
INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM

02:39:53.483 --> 02:39:54.384
AND LOW CARBON TRANSIT

02:39:54.451 --> 02:39:55.786
OPERATIONS PROGRAM WHICH HAVE

02:39:55.852 --> 02:39:56.453
BEEN REFERENCED YET THIS

02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:58.055
MORNING. HAVE DIRECTLY

02:39:58.121 --> 02:39:59.289
SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF

02:39:59.356 --> 02:40:00.958
CORE CAPACITY PROJECTS THE

02:40:01.024 --> 02:40:02.359
REPLACEMENT OF AGING TRANSIT

02:40:02.426 --> 02:40:04.161
VEHICLES AND INCREASE TRANSIT

02:40:04.227 --> 02:40:04.995
OPERATIONS THAT HAVE

02:40:05.062 --> 02:40:09.933
COLLECTIVELY. ENDS OF CARBON

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.269
DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT WITH THE

02:40:12.336 --> 02:40:13.503
STATE'S INVESTMENT IN ZERO

02:40:13.570 --> 02:40:15.005
MISSION BUSES CALIFORNIA IS NOW

02:40:15.072 --> 02:40:17.507
ON TRACK TO HAVE ONE THOUSAND

02:40:17.574 --> 02:40:18.275
ZERO EMISSION BUSES IN

02:40:18.342 --> 02:40:20.344
OPERATIONS ON THE ORDER OF BY

02:40:20.410 --> 02:40:22.612
THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THIS

02:40:22.679 --> 02:40:23.513
PROGRESS IS IN KEEPING WITH

02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:25.015
CARBS INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANSIT

02:40:25.082 --> 02:40:26.917
REGULATION AND IS MADE

02:40:26.984 --> 02:40:28.719
CALIFORNIA THE DOMINANT MARKET

02:40:28.785 --> 02:40:29.820
FOR ZERO MISSION BUSES IN THE

02:40:29.886 --> 02:40:32.122
COUNTRY AND AS A SIDE I WOULD

02:40:32.189 --> 02:40:33.290
NOTE IN THE PRESENTATION BY THE

02:40:33.357 --> 02:40:34.758
LEAD ANALYST THIS. THEY

02:40:34.825 --> 02:40:36.593
REFERENCED HOW CAN CALIFORNIA

02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:37.928
EXPORTS SOME OF THESE CONCEPTS

02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:40.464
TO BRING OTHER STATES ALONG AND

02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:42.065
ONE THING TO CONSIDER AND THIS

02:40:42.132 --> 02:40:43.967
GOES TO PROFESSOR ROLAND'S-

02:40:44.034 --> 02:40:45.869
COMMON ABOUT THE I WOULD CALL

02:40:45.936 --> 02:40:47.404
IT THE EEVEE DIVIDENDS LIKE A

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:49.373
PEACE DIVIDEND IS CALIFORNIA IS

02:40:49.439 --> 02:40:51.208
THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER ZERO

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:53.543
MISSION BUSES IN THE COUNTRY.

02:40:53.610 --> 02:40:56.013
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY THERE.

02:40:56.079 --> 02:40:56.613
THREE STATE EFFORTS LIKE THE

02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:57.647
CALIFORNIA INTEGRATED TRAVEL

02:40:57.714 --> 02:40:59.216
PLAN OR PROJECT TO TRANSIT

02:40:59.282 --> 02:41:00.817
AGENCIES WILL SOON HAVE THE

02:41:00.884 --> 02:41:02.886
TOOLS TO PRESENT AN INTEGRATED.

02:41:02.953 --> 02:41:05.122
AND SEAMLESS MOBILITY.

02:41:05.188 --> 02:41:06.990
EXPERIENCE TO WOULD BE WRITERS.

02:41:07.057 --> 02:41:09.126
BUT IMPORTANTLY AND I THINK

02:41:09.192 --> 02:41:10.227
WE'VE HEARD THIS A LOT THIS

02:41:10.293 --> 02:41:13.263
MORNING THERE ARE MANY-STRATEGIES THAT MANY IF NOT

02:41:13.330 --> 02:41:14.731
MOST TRANSIT AGENCIES CANNOT

02:41:14.798 --> 02:41:16.666
PURSUE THEMSELVES AND THAT

02:41:16.733 --> 02:41:17.968
REQUIRE EXTERNAL SUPPORT TO

02:41:18.035 --> 02:41:19.403
ACCOMPLISH INCLUDING FROM YOU

02:41:19.469 --> 02:41:22.039
ALL. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE

02:41:22.105 --> 02:41:23.373
SOME OF THE TOUGHER CHALLENGES

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:24.341
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WRESTLING

02:41:24.408 --> 02:41:26.610
WITH HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND

02:41:26.676 --> 02:41:28.979
LAND USE. AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY

02:41:29.046 --> 02:41:29.946
THIS MORNING THE SORT OF

02:41:30.013 --> 02:41:31.648
CONSISTENT MESSAGING AROUND THE

02:41:31.715 --> 02:41:33.717
NEED FOR PRICING. IN SAN

02:41:33.784 --> 02:41:34.918
FRANCISCO WE HAVE A TRANSIT

02:41:34.985 --> 02:41:36.486
FIRST POLICY WHICH MEANS THAT

02:41:36.553 --> 02:41:37.721
WE CAN ADVANCE DISCUSSIONS

02:41:37.788 --> 02:41:38.889
AROUND THE TYPE OF TRADE OFFS

02:41:38.955 --> 02:41:40.424
NEEDED. IN TERMS OF THE STREET

02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:41.958
RIGHT OF WAY TO MAKE TRANSIT A

02:41:42.025 --> 02:41:43.193
PRIORITY AND THERE WAS

02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:44.828
REFERENCE EARLIER TODAY ABOUT

02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:46.396
OUR RECENT DECISION TO CLOSE

02:41:46.463 --> 02:41:47.664
MARKET STREET AND IF YOU'VE

02:41:47.731 --> 02:41:48.598
BEEN TO SAN FRANCISCO YOU KNOW

02:41:48.665 --> 02:41:51.168
THAT MARKET STREET IS. OUR MOST

02:41:51.234 --> 02:41:54.104
IMPORTANT DOWNTOWN CORRIDOR IN

02:41:54.171 --> 02:41:56.039
JANUARY WE ELIMINATE ALL

02:41:56.106 --> 02:41:57.574
PRIVATE AUTOMOBILES ON MARKET

02:41:57.641 --> 02:41:59.776
STREET WE SEE TWO HUNDRED BUSES

02:41:59.843 --> 02:42:01.578
PER HOUR DURING THE PEAK. AND

02:42:01.645 --> 02:42:03.246
MANY TRAVEL TIMES HAVE IMPROVED

02:42:03.313 --> 02:42:05.949
BY 12% SINCE JANUARY I CAN TELL

02:42:06.016 --> 02:42:07.484
YOU THAT WHEN I WALK ON MARKET

02:42:07.551 --> 02:42:10.253
STREET NOW. IT'S AND IT'S YES

02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:13.190
THERE ARE NO PRIVATE CARS- YES

02:42:13.256 --> 02:42:15.058
WE'VE REMOVED. UBER AND LIFT.

02:42:15.125 --> 02:42:16.593
BUT WHAT PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTED

02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:19.029
ON IS HOW QUIET IT IS. IT'S

02:42:19.096 --> 02:42:20.730
ACTUALLY AN INCREDIBLE SHIFT IN

02:42:20.797 --> 02:42:23.366
AN EXPERIENCE AS A PEDESTRIAN.

02:42:23.433 --> 02:42:25.302
OR AS A MODE USER YOU CAN

02:42:25.368 --> 02:42:26.136
ACTUALLY HEAR BIRDS AT THIS

02:42:26.203 --> 02:42:27.637
POINT ON MARKET STREET WHICH IS

02:42:27.704 --> 02:42:29.473
REALLY INCREDIBLE. HOWEVER IN

02:42:29.539 --> 02:42:31.041
MOST CALIFORNIA CITIES BUSES

02:42:31.108 --> 02:42:32.809
LIGHT RAIL VEHICLES ARE FORCED

02:42:32.876 --> 02:42:34.144
TO OPERATE IN MIXED TRAFFIC.

02:42:34.211 --> 02:42:35.112
MEANING THAT WHEN THERE ARE

02:42:35.178 --> 02:42:37.481
TRAFFIC DELAYS ON THE ROADWAY

02:42:37.547 --> 02:42:38.682
DUE TO AN ACCIDENT TRAFFIC

02:42:38.748 --> 02:42:40.517
LIGHT TRANSIT IS LOADED PUSHED

02:42:40.584 --> 02:42:42.619
OFF SCHEDULE. THIS REALITY IS

02:42:42.686 --> 02:42:43.687
THE RESULT OF DECISIONS MADE BY

02:42:43.753 --> 02:42:45.388
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO GOVERN

02:42:45.455 --> 02:42:47.124
THE RIGHT OF WAY AND WHO ARE

02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.624
OFTEN THOUGH NOT ALWAYS

02:42:47.691 --> 02:42:48.458
DIVORCED FROM HER TRANSIT

02:42:48.525 --> 02:42:51.328
AGENCIES. ACTIONS TO CREATE BUS

02:42:51.394 --> 02:42:53.130
ONLY LANES. SUCH AS IN SAN

02:42:53.196 --> 02:42:54.231
FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND

02:42:54.297 --> 02:42:55.932
DEMOCRATIC DEDICATED RIGHT OF

02:42:55.999 --> 02:42:57.534
WAY LIKE LA METRO SILVER AN

02:42:57.601 --> 02:42:59.503
ORANGE LINES. OR TRAFFIC LIGHT

02:42:59.569 --> 02:43:00.804
PRIVATIZATION FOR PUBLIC

02:43:00.871 --> 02:43:02.539
TRANSIT ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM

02:43:02.606 --> 02:43:03.740
HEAD ON BY GIVING TRANSIT

02:43:03.807 --> 02:43:05.775
VEHICLES TRAVEL PREFERENCE OVER

02:43:05.842 --> 02:43:07.777
SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES. IN

02:43:07.844 --> 02:43:09.746
DOING SO THEY IMPROVE ON TIME

02:43:09.813 --> 02:43:10.714
PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:12.582
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION MAKING

02:43:12.649 --> 02:43:14.417
TRANSIT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO

02:43:14.484 --> 02:43:16.086
WOULD BE WRITERS. AND TRANSIT

02:43:16.153 --> 02:43:18.155
AGENCIES EXPECT THAT CHAIRMAN

02:43:18.221 --> 02:43:19.523
BILLS BUS ON SHOULDER

02:43:19.589 --> 02:43:20.991
LEGISLATION. COULD DELIVER

02:43:21.057 --> 02:43:22.926
SIMILAR BENEFITS TO COMMUTER

02:43:22.993 --> 02:43:24.060
BUSES OPERATING ON THE STATE

02:43:24.127 --> 02:43:26.663
HIGHWAY SYSTEM. HOWEVER THERE

02:43:26.730 --> 02:43:28.698
IS THEN LAND USE AND HOUSING.

02:43:28.765 --> 02:43:30.634
SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE PUT INTO

02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:31.835
PLACE THE FRAMEWORK FOR LINKING

02:43:31.902 --> 02:43:33.370
LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION

02:43:33.436 --> 02:43:35.305
DECISION MAKING BUT IT LACKS

02:43:35.372 --> 02:43:36.840
THE FUNDING SUPPORT AS WELL AS

02:43:36.907 --> 02:43:37.941
THE STICK TO ENSURE THAT

02:43:38.008 --> 02:43:40.043
REGION'S CAN COMPLY WITH THEIR

02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:41.912
OWN PLANS AND TARGET SETTING.

02:43:41.978 --> 02:43:43.380
WHAT RESULTS AND THIS IS BORNE

02:43:43.446 --> 02:43:44.581
OUT BY THE DATA PUBLISHED

02:43:44.648 --> 02:43:46.950
RECENTLY BY A RP IS THAT SPRAWL

02:43:47.017 --> 02:43:48.552
WHICH IS INHERENTLY CHALLENGING

02:43:48.618 --> 02:43:49.819
FOR TRANSIT TO PERFORM WELL

02:43:49.886 --> 02:43:51.821
ACROSS. CONTINUES TO CONSUME

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:54.257
OUR STATE AND OUR STATE. AND

02:43:54.324 --> 02:43:55.825
OUR RELIANCE ON AUTUMN ABILITY

02:43:55.892 --> 02:43:56.793
BECOMES MORE AND MORE

02:43:56.860 --> 02:44:01.565
ENTRENCHED. AT THE SAME TIME

02:44:01.631 --> 02:44:02.132
OUR STATE CONTINUING PROBLEM

02:44:02.199 --> 02:44:03.200
WITH HOUSING AFFORDABILITY HAS

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:05.168
SUBURBANITES PROPERTY PUSHING

02:44:05.235 --> 02:44:06.903
ONE SCORE TRANSIT RIDERS AWAY

02:44:06.970 --> 02:44:08.305
FROM THE CITY CENTERS WERE

02:44:08.371 --> 02:44:10.507
TRANSIT IS A PRACTICAL OPTION.

I COMMEND THIS TO YOU- AS A

02:44:21.218 --> 02:44:23.386
REALLY GREAT CONCISE IN ITS

02:44:23.453 --> 02:44:24.988
POLICY BRIEF SUMMARY ON THE

02:44:25.055 --> 02:44:26.289
TRENDS THAT ARE IMPACTING

02:44:26.356 --> 02:44:28.525
TRANSIT RIDERSHIP. MORE THAN

THREE AND FIVE BAY AREA WORKERS

02:44:29.659 --> 02:44:30.794
NOW LIVE AND WORK IN

02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:31.995
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH RELATIVELY

02:44:32.062 --> 02:44:33.463
POOR TRANSIT ACCESS TO

02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:35.632
EMPLOYMENT. WHAT'S MORE WE ARE

02:44:35.699 --> 02:44:37.167
NOW SEEING THAT FEWER BAY AREA

02:44:37.234 --> 02:44:38.969
RESIDENTS LIVE AND WORK IN THE

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:40.470

DISTANCES FOR ALL BAY AREA

02:44:42.272 --> 02:44:44.341

02:44:44.407 --> 02:44:45.609
ARE TO STEM THE TIDE OF RISING

02:44:45.675 --> 02:44:47.210
BMT AND TRANSPORTATION

02:44:47.277 --> 02:44:48.411

02:44:48.478 --> 02:44:49.746
THESE CHALLENGES HEAD ON. BY

SECRETARY KIM STATED SO WELL

02:45:01.091 --> 02:45:02.592
AND UNEQUIVOCALLY THIS MORNING

02:45:02.659 --> 02:45:04.461
IT MATTERS. IT'S A BIT

02:45:04.527 --> 02:45:05.362
REDUCTIVE BUT WHEN COMMUTERS

02:45:05.428 --> 02:45:07.397
HAVE THE OPTION OF TAKING A

02:45:07.464 --> 02:45:09.699

TRANSFERS FOR THREE DOLLARS.

02:45:12.669 --> 02:45:15.071
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THOSE

WITH MEANS CHOOSE THE FORMER.

02:45:17.107 --> 02:45:17.941
WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT

02:45:18.008 --> 02:45:19.276
PRICING OUR TRANSPORTATION

02:45:19.342 --> 02:45:21.511

GGG AND CONGESTION. REDUCE

02:45:28.985 --> 02:45:30.220
REDUCING THESE WE OUGHT TO

02:45:30.287 --> 02:45:32.455
APPLY A COST TO THAT AND BAKE

02:45:32.522 --> 02:45:34.824
IT RECIPE INTO THE PRICE OF

02:45:34.891 --> 02:45:35.959

ABOUT- ONE OF ONE OF THE

02:46:45.929 --> 02:46:48.131
STRATEGIES- TO GET MORE TRANSIT

02:46:48.198 --> 02:46:52.001
RIDERSHIP OF WOULD BE TO. THERE

02:46:52.068 --> 02:46:54.537
IS SOME KIND OF EXTREME FAIR

02:46:54.604 --> 02:46:57.374

STUDENTS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS

02:47:09.252 --> 02:47:13.823
IS THERE IS THERE. A RIDERSHIP

02:47:13.890 --> 02:47:15.392
INCREASE WHEN THE TRANSIT

02:47:15.458 --> 02:47:17.961
DISCOUNT FAIRER YOU KNOW LIKE

02:47:18.027 --> 02:47:19.696
THE GIVE TRANSIT PASSES SOME

02:47:19.763 --> 02:47:21.364
PLACES THE GIVEN FOR FREE THEY

02:47:21.431 --> 02:47:23.867
GET THEY GIVE HERE'S YOUR PAST

02:47:23.933 --> 02:47:26.369
YOU HAVE A BASS YOU. CAN CUT

02:47:26.436 --> 02:47:28.872
AND RIDE TRANSIT AND THEN THE

02:47:28.938 --> 02:47:30.340
OTHER THE OTHER STRATEGY ON THE

02:47:30.407 --> 02:47:32.842
OTHER HAND ON TRANSIT DISCOUNTS

02:47:32.909 --> 02:47:34.310
IS TO HAVE THE EMPLOYER PROVIDE

02:47:34.377 --> 02:47:37.313
ALL THEIR- EMPLOYEES WOULD

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:40.617
TRANSIT PASSES ARE THOSE KINDS

02:47:40.683 --> 02:47:44.587
OF OPTIONS- DO THEY HAVE AN

02:47:44.654 --> 02:47:47.924
IMPACT ON. A RIDERSHIP AND TO

02:47:47.991 --> 02:47:49.592
HAVE AN IMPACT ON GETTING

02:47:49.659 --> 02:47:54.597
PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS INTO

02:47:54.664 --> 02:47:56.766
FOR THE WE'VE SAID. WELL SO I

02:47:56.833 --> 02:47:59.836
WOULD SAY- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF

02:47:59.903 --> 02:48:01.638
IN GENERAL OF ALL PROGRAMS THAT

02:48:01.704 --> 02:48:03.339
PROVIDE TRANSIT AND ENCOURAGE

02:48:03.406 --> 02:48:04.541
TRANSIT RIDERSHIP WHETHER IT'S

02:48:04.607 --> 02:48:07.444
THROUGH EMPLOYERS OR USE PASSES

02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:08.645
ON IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE A

02:48:08.711 --> 02:48:11.614
VERY ROBUST ROBUST FREE MUNY

02:48:11.681 --> 02:48:13.817
FOR LOW INCOME YOUTH SENIORS

02:48:13.883 --> 02:48:16.619
AND DISABLED RESIDENTS. AND

02:48:16.686 --> 02:48:17.987
THROUGH THAT PROGRAM WE HAVE

02:48:18.054 --> 02:48:20.290
SEEN AN INCREASE ON RIDERSHIP

02:48:20.356 --> 02:48:23.593
AMONG STUDENTS USING MUNY- I

02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:26.162
THINK THE KEY ONE OF THE ONE OF

02:48:26.229 --> 02:48:27.664
THE IDEAS I HAVE IS THAT WHEN

02:48:27.730 --> 02:48:28.765
YOU GO TO KINDERGARTEN SHOULD

02:48:28.832 --> 02:48:30.366
GET A TRANSIT PASS. IT SHOULD

02:48:30.433 --> 02:48:31.534
BE HOW WE BRING ALONG

02:48:31.601 --> 02:48:33.236
GENERATION OF WRITERS BUT THE

02:48:33.303 --> 02:48:35.004
KEY IS TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW

02:48:35.071 --> 02:48:36.606
WE PAY FOR THAT I THINK THAT

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:39.042
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ON THIS AS

02:48:39.108 --> 02:48:42.378
A AS AS A AS A PROGRAM THAT WE

02:48:42.445 --> 02:48:44.414
WANT TO ENCOURAGE WE DO NEED TO

02:48:44.481 --> 02:48:46.683
THINK ABOUT. ALL THAT THE CALL

02:48:46.749 --> 02:48:49.686
THAT. HE I IT IS INSURANCE OUR

02:48:49.752 --> 02:48:51.287
PROGRAM I JUST AS FREE. COST US

02:48:51.354 --> 02:48:52.555
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR

02:48:52.622 --> 02:48:54.190
JUST A STRAIGHT UP THAT COMES

02:48:54.257 --> 02:48:56.192
OUT OF OUR OPERATING BUDGET- WE

02:48:56.259 --> 02:48:57.260
HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE IN SAN

02:48:57.327 --> 02:48:58.928
FRANCISCO TO HAVE A SORT OF OUR

02:48:58.995 --> 02:49:00.096
OPERATING BUDGET SUPPORTED BY

02:49:00.163 --> 02:49:01.297
THE GENERAL FUND OF THE CITY

02:49:01.364 --> 02:49:02.899
AND COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO. I

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:03.867
DON'T BELIEVE ANY OTHER

02:49:03.933 --> 02:49:06.503
OPERATOR IN CALIFORNIA HAS THAT

02:49:06.569 --> 02:49:08.338
AND SO AS WE LOOK TO THESE.

02:49:08.404 --> 02:49:09.839
PUSH AND PULL LEVERS AROUND

02:49:09.906 --> 02:49:12.542
PRICING. FOR EXAMPLE IF E'RE

02:49:12.609 --> 02:49:13.676
GOING TO IMPLEMENT CORDON

02:49:13.743 --> 02:49:15.111
PRICING OR CONGESTION PRICING

02:49:15.178 --> 02:49:17.146
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO SUPPORT.

02:49:17.213 --> 02:49:19.015
THE PRICING THAT WE NEAR THE OF

02:49:19.082 --> 02:49:19.883
THE FUNDING THAT WE NEED TO

02:49:19.949 --> 02:49:21.317
PROVIDE THESE KINDS OF

02:49:21.384 --> 02:49:25.455
PROPOSALS UNDER. THE COMMENT.

02:49:25.522 --> 02:49:29.893
ASKING PROFESSOR OF ROLEN HOPES

02:49:29.959 --> 02:49:31.394
THE WHOLE STE YOU WERE TALKING

02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:35.598
ABOUT- REACHING THIS PARITY ON-

02:49:35.665 --> 02:49:39.836
EVEY. PURCHASING PER OWNERSHIP

02:49:39.903 --> 02:49:42.672
RIGHTS BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTY

02:49:42.739 --> 02:49:44.674
AND WE HAVE WE HAVE A PROGRAM

02:49:44.741 --> 02:49:47.977
NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

02:49:48.044 --> 02:49:49.445
FOR LOW INCOME FOR OUR FOLKS

02:49:49.512 --> 02:49:52.749
SAID CARS FOR ALL THAT WE WANT

02:49:52.815 --> 02:49:55.318
WE HAVE A DESIRE TO MAKE SURE

02:49:55.385 --> 02:49:57.520
THAT THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE

02:49:57.587 --> 02:50:00.323
HAVE ACCESS TO PURCHASING- E.

02:50:00.390 --> 02:50:04.294
V. MY- VEHICLES. IS THAT

02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:05.662
REALISTIC BASED ON YOUR

02:50:05.728 --> 02:50:07.463
RESEARCH ME SEEMS LIKE A NICE

02:50:07.530 --> 02:50:11.334
PROGRAM. OR COULD THAT MONEY BE

02:50:11.401 --> 02:50:15.238
SPENT BETTER- IN THE SHORT TERM

02:50:15.305 --> 02:50:17.373
RATHER THAN THE LONG TERM I

02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:18.408
WOULD CERTAINLY ADVOCATES-

02:50:18.474 --> 02:50:20.143
SHORT TERM COMMITMENTS AND I'M

02:50:20.209 --> 02:50:23.379
VERY CONCERNED THIS BAG I. I

02:50:23.446 --> 02:50:25.481
CERTAINLY SHARE THE CONCERN

02:50:25.548 --> 02:50:28.351
THAT WAS EXPRESSED ABOUT THE-

02:50:28.418 --> 02:50:30.920
DOWNWARD- ADJUSTMENT- IN C. B.

02:50:30.987 --> 02:50:32.589
R. P. RESOURCES POTENTIAL

02:50:32.655 --> 02:50:34.057
DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS VIA THE

02:50:34.123 --> 02:50:35.458
RESOURCES BECAUSE I THINK THE

02:50:35.525 --> 02:50:36.626
STATE SHOULD BE DOUBLING DOWN

02:50:36.693 --> 02:50:39.696
RIGHT NOW AND- AS I. INDICATED

02:50:39.762 --> 02:50:41.164
OUR PROJECTIONS OF THE BE VERY

02:50:41.230 --> 02:50:43.700
SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE DIVIDENDS-

02:50:43.766 --> 02:50:44.634
AS A RESULT OF THE GROWTH

02:50:44.701 --> 02:50:46.769
STIMULUS SO THE STATE COULD GET

02:50:46.836 --> 02:50:48.671
THIS MONEY BACK IF IT HAS A

02:50:48.738 --> 02:50:50.773
LONG TERM FINANCING SCHEME.

02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:52.408
THAT WOULD ENABLE THAT AS FAR

02:50:52.475 --> 02:50:52.875
AS THE DISTRIBUTIONAL

02:50:52.942 --> 02:50:54.043
IMPLICATIONS YES I AM

02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:55.612
PERSONALLY AN ADVOCATE OF A

02:50:55.678 --> 02:50:57.213
MORE INCLUSIVE APPROACH TO- TO

02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:58.748
THESE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES

02:50:58.815 --> 02:51:01.117
AND I THINK THIS STATE. COULD

02:51:01.184 --> 02:51:03.219
SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE TERMS

02:51:03.286 --> 02:51:04.854
OF ACQUISITION FOR THESE

02:51:04.921 --> 02:51:06.656
VEHICLES FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE

02:51:06.723 --> 02:51:08.124
BECAUSE IT REALLY IS TO FIX

02:51:08.191 --> 02:51:09.459
COST THEY'LL BENEFIT

02:51:09.525 --> 02:51:10.193
PROPORTIONALLY MORE FROM THE

02:51:10.259 --> 02:51:12.028
FUEL THINGS BECAUSE- THAT'S

02:51:12.095 --> 02:51:13.463
EVERY YOU KNOW IT'S THE SAME

02:51:13.529 --> 02:51:15.298
COST PER GALLON. FOR EVERYBODY

02:51:15.365 --> 02:51:16.899
WHO DRIVES A GUESS MY QUESTION

02:51:16.966 --> 02:51:20.703
IS AS AN ECONOMIST WE HAVE. THE

02:51:20.770 --> 02:51:22.772
GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED A BUDGET

02:51:22.839 --> 02:51:24.607
THAT REDUCES THE C. B. R. P.

02:51:24.674 --> 02:51:25.575
FOUR HUNDRED. AND TWENTY WE'VE

02:51:25.642 --> 02:51:28.277
GOT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE 30% OF

02:51:28.344 --> 02:51:29.879
THAT HAS TO GO TO LOW INCOME

02:51:29.946 --> 02:51:31.748
FOLKS SO THAT REDUCE. THE

02:51:31.814 --> 02:51:35.885
AMOUNT EVEN MORE. TO IN THIS

02:51:35.952 --> 02:51:36.753
OTHER ENOUGH LIKELY VOTER.

02:51:36.819 --> 02:51:38.087
GIVEN THE NINETY FIVE DOLLAR

02:51:38.154 --> 02:51:41.190
INCENTIVE. GIVEN EVERY ALL THE

02:51:41.257 --> 02:51:43.159
OTHER STRAINS THAT PEOPLE HAVE

02:51:43.226 --> 02:51:44.360
TODAY TO PARTICIPATE MAY I

02:51:44.427 --> 02:51:45.695
GUESS WE'LL KNOW AT THE END OF

02:51:45.762 --> 02:51:46.996
THE YEAR WILL KNOW IT IT'LL

02:51:47.063 --> 02:51:48.264
DEPEND ON YOUR CONSTITUENCY OF

02:51:48.331 --> 02:51:50.867
COURSE RIGHT BUT- I THINK THAT

02:51:50.933 --> 02:51:52.201
THEY'RE JUST VERY STRONG

02:51:52.268 --> 02:51:54.003
JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TRYING TO

02:51:54.070 --> 02:51:55.038
MAKE THESE VEHICLESMORE

02:51:55.104 --> 02:51:58.241
ACCESSIBLE- AS SOON AS WE COULD

02:51:58.307 --> 02:51:59.809
DO THAT AND YOU THE FOLLOWING

02:51:59.876 --> 02:52:01.444
IS NECESSARY TO DO IT AND AS I

02:52:01.511 --> 02:52:02.912
SAID I THINK THE STATE SHOULD

02:52:02.979 --> 02:52:03.880
REALLY BE DOUBLING DOWN

02:52:03.946 --> 02:52:05.615
INCENTIVES. ACROSS THE BOARD

02:52:05.682 --> 02:52:07.183
BUT PARTICULARLY IN THOSE

02:52:07.250 --> 02:52:08.918
CATEGORIES- THEY'RE-

02:52:08.985 --> 02:52:11.054
UNDERSERVED BY THESE- BUT IT'S

02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:12.622
TECHNOLOGIES AND NEED THE

02:52:12.689 --> 02:52:13.690
BENNETT THIS LOCAL PUBLIC

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:15.024
HEALTH BENEFITS AND EVEN THE

02:52:15.091 --> 02:52:16.492
FUEL SAVINGS BENEFITS WILL MEAN

02:52:16.559 --> 02:52:18.528
MORE TO THEM AND SAYS SO I JUST

02:52:18.594 --> 02:52:21.230
I REALLY THINK. THE STATE

02:52:21.297 --> 02:52:23.599
SHOULD RECONSIDER- AND THINK

02:52:23.666 --> 02:52:25.068
ABOUT MAKING A MUCH MORE

02:52:25.134 --> 02:52:25.935
SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT TO

02:52:26.002 --> 02:52:27.670
INCENTIVES BECAUSE I THINK THAT

02:52:27.737 --> 02:52:29.906
THEY'LL BE PAID BACK OVER THE

02:52:29.972 --> 02:52:32.675
MEDIA. IN THE LONG TERM BY

02:52:32.742 --> 02:52:33.209
TWENTY FIFTY THAT'S RIGHT

02:52:33.276 --> 02:52:34.510
THAT'S RIGHT AND EVEN YOU KNOW

02:52:34.577 --> 02:52:36.446
EVEN IF WE REACH PARITY IN

02:52:36.512 --> 02:52:38.214
TERMS OF COST PREDICTING

02:52:38.281 --> 02:52:39.549
TECHNIQUE BUDGET OPTION IT IS A

02:52:39.615 --> 02:52:41.984
FOOL'S GAME IT'S REALLY HARD-

02:52:42.051 --> 02:52:43.753
WE DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE THE

02:52:43.820 --> 02:52:45.722
DOOR WE- A CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES

02:52:45.788 --> 02:52:47.824
AND NOT OTHERS BUT- IT'S CLEAR

02:52:47.890 --> 02:52:49.358
THAT. WE NEEDED SOMETHING IT'S

02:52:49.425 --> 02:52:51.094
LIKE AN IPHONE ON WHEELS THIS

02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:52.462
HAS TO BE A CONSUMER GOOD THE

02:52:52.528 --> 02:52:53.963
PEOPLE WHAT YOU CAN GET PEOPLE

02:52:54.030 --> 02:52:55.465
TO BUY YOU THESE BY GUILT

02:52:55.531 --> 02:52:57.200
TRIPPING ABOUT THE CLIMATE. YOU

02:52:57.266 --> 02:52:58.668
CAN DO IT BY GET SHOWING THEM

02:52:58.735 --> 02:53:00.103
LONG LISTS OF ACCOUNTING

02:53:00.169 --> 02:53:02.371
NUMBERS ABOUT PAY BACK THEY

02:53:02.438 --> 02:53:03.639
HAVE TO DESIRE THESE THINGS AND

02:53:03.706 --> 02:53:04.907
OF COURSE YOU KNOW TEXAS SEEMS

02:53:04.974 --> 02:53:06.609
TO BE GAINING MOMENTUM NOW

02:53:06.676 --> 02:53:08.945
WHICH IS A GOOD SIGN- THE OTHER

02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:10.179
BELIEVE ME WHAT IS REALLY GOING

02:53:10.246 --> 02:53:12.415
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE OR THE

02:53:12.482 --> 02:53:13.449
OTHER. ESPECIALLY INTERNATIONAL

02:53:13.516 --> 02:53:16.719
PRODUCES BOOK INSTITUTE TO WELL

02:53:16.786 --> 02:53:18.354
RIGHT IS IT LIKE VEHICLES BY

02:53:18.421 --> 02:53:20.022
THE NECK TO YOUR- AND WE'LL SEE

02:53:20.089 --> 02:53:21.190
UP TO THIRTY FORTY AS YOU'LL

02:53:21.257 --> 02:53:23.226
SEE IN THIS REPORT IN SURVEY OF

02:53:23.292 --> 02:53:25.795
MERGING OF VEHICLES CHOICE. W.

02:53:25.862 --> 02:53:27.230
PARITY AND THEY'RE JUST GOING

02:53:27.296 --> 02:53:28.331
TO BE TREMENDOUS PRIDE VARIETY

02:53:28.397 --> 02:53:31.834
SO I HOPE THAT THIS WILL AS A

02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:34.470
RESULT OF THE PUZZLE ABOUT WHY.

02:53:34.537 --> 02:53:36.572
DUSTING THESE VEHICLES TO SHARE

02:53:36.639 --> 02:53:43.980
BRING YOU INDICATED THAT. THE

02:53:44.046 --> 02:53:45.848
THAT THOU IN ET BUT IS. YES

02:53:45.915 --> 02:53:46.883
SOME OF. MANY OF THEM ARE

02:53:46.949 --> 02:53:48.818
PRODUCER CAL. HAS A BONA AFFECT

02:53:48.885 --> 02:53:52.188
OUTSIDE THE- TO SAY CAL WE HAVE

02:53:52.255 --> 02:53:54.323
PROVIDED. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

02:53:54.390 --> 02:53:56.526
MONEY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO-

02:53:56.592 --> 02:53:58.961
HAVE A BUS IS NOT A WHOLE LOT

02:53:59.028 --> 02:54:03.166
OF MONEY BUT IT'S BUT SOME WHAT.

02:54:03.232 --> 02:54:04.300
WHAT MIGHT WHAT TYPE OF

02:54:04.367 --> 02:54:05.568
INVESTMENT DO YOU THINK THAT WE

02:54:05.635 --> 02:54:06.602
NEED TO MAKE IN ORDER TO GET

02:54:06.669 --> 02:54:08.171
THAT TO SCALE ON A NATIONAL

02:54:08.237 --> 02:54:11.073
LEVEL TO. I MEAN I THINK THERE

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:12.408
IS AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE

02:54:12.475 --> 02:54:15.044
WORK WITH THE CARBS INNOVATIVE

02:54:15.111 --> 02:54:16.946
CLEAN TRANS REGULATION WE- THEY

02:54:17.013 --> 02:54:18.281
CAME TO UNDERSTAND I THINK THE

02:54:18.347 --> 02:54:19.816
LIMITATIONS OF THE INDUSTRY TO

02:54:19.882 --> 02:54:21.884
SCALE UP. LIKE THERE IS THIS%

02:54:21.951 --> 02:54:23.152
GETTING UP TO A PLACE WHERE WE

02:54:23.219 --> 02:54:24.954
CAN PRODUCE ENOUGH OF THE

02:54:25.021 --> 02:54:26.289
VEHICLES THAT THE DEMAND IS

02:54:26.355 --> 02:54:28.491
GOING TO BE FOR. SO I THINK THE

02:54:28.558 --> 02:54:30.426
MORE THAT WE CAN ADVANCED

02:54:30.493 --> 02:54:32.061

WE SEE THAT IT'S OPEN SOURCE.

02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:30.119
TRAFFIC CONGESTION I'M

02:55:30.186 --> 02:55:31.687
SUGGESTING TO YOU THAT THAT

02:55:31.754 --> 02:55:33.422
SHOULD BE SOMETHING BECOMING IN

02:55:33.489 --> 02:55:34.924
THE MANDATES OF YOUR ACTIVE

02:55:34.991 --> 02:55:37.493
TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THAT IS

02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:39.996
A SINGLE THING THAT AFFECTS

02:55:40.062 --> 02:55:41.931
MOST PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ES

BECAUSE THEY'RE NOW DISMANTLING

02:55:47.703 --> 02:55:49.906
THEIR RAPID TRANSIT BECAUSE

02:55:49.972 --> 02:55:50.806
THEY DIDN'T PUT THE SIGNAL

02:55:50.873 --> 02:55:53.042
ENHANCEMENTS AND OTHER THINGS

02:55:53.109 --> 02:55:55.411
THE DEAL WITH CONGESTION SINGLE

02:55:55.478 --> 02:55:57.546

WILL OFFER TO YOU IS I'M GOING

02:55:59.382 --> 02:56:00.716
TO SUGGEST TO YOU IS THAT YOU

02:56:00.783 --> 02:56:04.954
LOOK AT THE- ABILITY. OF

02:56:05.021 --> 02:56:08.257
NATURAL GAS AS A TAX REVENUE

02:56:08.324 --> 02:56:10.760
SOURCE DO NOT EXEMPT TRANSIT OR

02:56:10.826 --> 02:56:13.029
AGENCIES FROM IT SO THAT YOU

02:56:13.095 --> 02:56:15.464
CAN FIND THIS CHANGE OVER

02:56:15.531 --> 02:56:17.533
BECAUSE YOU REPEATEDLY SAY YOU

02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:20.636
DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR IT.

02:56:20.703 --> 02:56:22.705

WE CAN REDUCE. EMISSIONS BY TEN

03:10:35.290 --> 03:10:37.425
MILLION METRIC TONS ANNUALLY SO

03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:39.494
THAT'S JUST WHAT 5% OUR GOAL IS

03:10:39.561 --> 03:10:41.997

OPERATED DISADVANTAGED

03:17:47.222 --> 03:17:49.023
COMMUNITIES AS A LOT OF PLACES

03:17:49.090 --> 03:17:50.558
WHERE WAREHOUSES ARE IT'S A LOT

03:17:50.625 --> 03:17:51.492
OF PLACES WHERE TRUCKS HAVE TO

03:17:51.559 --> 03:17:52.860
TRAVEL THROUGH THOSE CORRIDORS

03:17:52.927 --> 03:17:55.096
SO BEING THAT W. DOWN ON THIS

03:17:55.163 --> 03:17:56.197
SPECIFIC PROGRAM DOES HELP BOTH

03:17:56.264 --> 03:17:57.565

03:17:57.632 --> 03:17:59.434
HAS A LOT EQUITY COMPONENT.

03:17:59.500 --> 03:18:00.435

INVESTMENT SHE MENTIONED ARE

03:18:26.194 --> 03:18:27.829
OFTEN SO VALUED BY CALIFORNIANS

03:18:27.895 --> 03:18:28.930
THAT THEY DRIVE HOUSING PRICES

03:18:28.997 --> 03:18:30.765
FAR ABOVE THE ABILITY FOR. THE

SEE SUBURBANIZATION OF POVERTY

03:18:42.310 --> 03:18:43.278
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE FALLING

03:18:43.344 --> 03:18:44.879
LAND VALUES. BECAUSE THE DEMAND

03:18:44.946 --> 03:18:46.014
ISN'T THERE WERE AS WERE YOU

SKYROCKET AND BECOME ACTUALLY A

03:18:52.487 --> 03:18:54.522
PROBLEM FOR KIND OF A RIDERSHIP

03:18:54.589 --> 03:18:55.857
FOR GREATER RIDERSHIP ISSUES SO

03:18:55.923 --> 03:18:57.225
WITHOUT THINGS LIKE

03:18:57.292 --> 03:18:58.192
AFFORDABILITY EMBEDDED IN TEO

03:18:58.259 --> 03:19:00.962
DE. UM SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A YOU

03:19:01.029 --> 03:19:03.331
KNOW AT. A LESS BAD PROBLEM TO

03:19:03.398 --> 03:19:04.666
HAVE RIGHT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:19:04.732 --> 03:19:05.867
CLAMORING TO LIVE WHERE THEY

03:19:05.933 --> 03:19:07.502
CAN HAVE GOOD ACCESS TO BUSES

IMPROVE TRANSITS

03:19:12.106 --> 03:19:13.274
COMPETITIVENESS AND PUBLIC

03:19:13.341 --> 03:19:14.475
THOROUGHFARES THROUGH BUS ONLY

03:19:14.542 --> 03:19:16.644
LANES AND OTHER WAYS. ARE KNOWN

03:19:16.711 --> 03:19:17.912
ONLY ENCOURAGING. THEY

03:19:17.979 --> 03:19:18.613
REPRESENT THE KINDS OF

03:19:18.680 --> 03:19:19.280
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

03:19:19.347 --> 03:19:20.982
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT

03:19:21.049 --> 03:19:22.850
REQUIRE NO NEW TECHNOLOGIES NOR

03:19:22.917 --> 03:19:23.718
ANY MAJOR SHIFT IN OUR

03:19:23.785 --> 03:19:25.353
THINKING. AND THESE GO TO WHAT

03:19:25.420 --> 03:19:26.954
SENATOR BELL HAD SAID WHEN HE

03:19:27.021 --> 03:19:27.755
TALKED ABOUT TIMES AND

03:19:27.822 --> 03:19:29.590
CONGESTION. THE TIMELINESS OF

03:19:29.657 --> 03:19:30.892
TRANSIT IN COMPETITION WITH

03:19:30.958 --> 03:19:31.759
OTHER MODES IS A VITAL

03:19:31.826 --> 03:19:33.394
COMPONENT. AND GOES DIRECTLY TO

03:19:33.461 --> 03:19:35.096
THE CONGESTION PROBLEM. TOO

03:19:35.163 --> 03:19:36.631
OFTEN PUBLIC TRANSIT IS STUCK

03:19:36.698 --> 03:19:38.299
IN THE SAME TRAFFIC. AND IT IS

03:19:38.366 --> 03:19:39.500
AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT THE

03:19:39.567 --> 03:19:40.702
MORE ROADS WE BUILD THE LONGER

03:19:40.768 --> 03:19:41.736
WE MAKE CONGESTION FOR ALL

03:19:41.803 --> 03:19:43.404
USERS. AND THE MORE WE

03:19:43.471 --> 03:19:44.238
INCENTIVIZE AND ST

03:19:44.305 --> 03:19:45.506
UNSUSTAINABLE GREEN FIELD

03:19:45.573 --> 03:19:46.941
DEVELOPMENT. AND WHEN I SAY AND

03:19:47.008 --> 03:19:48.843
SUSTAINABLE I MEAN IN TERMS OF

03:19:48.910 --> 03:19:50.011
CLIMATE BUT ALSO AN EXPENSE TO

03:19:50.078 --> 03:19:51.512
FAMILIES FORCED INTO DRIVING

03:19:51.579 --> 03:19:53.448
RIDICULOUSLY LONG COMMUTES. PAY

03:19:53.514 --> 03:19:55.016
FOR PARKING INSURANCE AND

03:19:55.083 --> 03:19:56.884
EXPENSE TO CITIES FORCED TO USE

03:19:56.951 --> 03:20:00.888
VALUABLE LANDS FOR PARKING

03:20:00.955 --> 03:20:01.456
SPACES. INSTEAD OF HOUSING.

03:20:01.522 --> 03:20:02.090
WHAT WE NEED A SICK. REFER OF

03:20:02.156 --> 03:20:03.424
CALIFORNIA'S. INFRASTRUCTURE

03:20:03.491 --> 03:20:05.593
INVESTMENTS WENEED TO ASK HOW

03:20:05.660 --> 03:20:06.761
TO DRAMATICALLY GROW TRANSIT

03:20:06.828 --> 03:20:08.229
RIDERSHIP. UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:20:08.296 --> 03:20:09.831
THE EXPENSE WILL BE LARGE BUT

03:20:09.897 --> 03:20:11.132
THE RESULT IN TREMENDOUS JOB

03:20:11.199 --> 03:20:12.433
CREATION BUT WILL RESULT IN

03:20:12.500 --> 03:20:13.868
TREMENDOUS JOB CREATION. AS

03:20:13.935 --> 03:20:16.170
WELL AS INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

03:20:16.237 --> 03:20:16.704
ALREADY GREATLY VALUED BY

03:20:16.771 --> 03:20:18.439
CALIFORNIANS. IT'S KNOWN ISSUE

03:20:18.506 --> 03:20:20.675
ABOUT. HOW TO BEST GROW TRANSIT

03:20:20.742 --> 03:20:21.542
THROUGH WRITER DEMAND IN

03:20:21.609 --> 03:20:22.977
TRANSIT SUPPLY IN A NOTED THAT

03:20:23.044 --> 03:20:24.445
THE LEGISLATURE SHOWING GREAT

03:20:24.512 --> 03:20:25.580
LEADERSHIP IN ITS SUPPORT FOR A

03:20:25.646 --> 03:20:26.681
VARIETY OF WAYS TO GROW

DEMAND NEEDED THROUGH TO PUSH

03:20:29.517 --> 03:20:31.419
TRANSIT IN PARTICULAR CURRENTLY

03:20:31.486 --> 03:20:32.520
THROUGH BILLS THAT WOULD

03:20:32.587 --> 03:20:34.789
PROVIDE FOR FAIR FREE ACCESS

03:20:34.856 --> 03:20:36.891

IS SHEER LANE I RUN THE ATRIUM

03:20:43.331 --> 03:20:44.699
WHICH IS A CREATIVE INNOVATION

03:20:44.766 --> 03:20:47.135
CENTER FOR SUSTAINABILITY- I

03:20:47.201 --> 03:20:49.137
WANT TO SAY THAT A LOT OF

03:20:49.203 --> 03:20:51.272
MENTION WAS HERE ON

03:20:51.339 --> 03:20:52.073
TRANSPORTATION BUT NOT A LOT

03:20:52.140 --> 03:20:54.609
WAS MENTIONED ON MANUFACTURING

03:20:54.675 --> 03:20:56.644
AND I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER

03:20:56.711 --> 03:20:59.180
THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. AS PART

03:20:59.247 --> 03:21:00.648
OF THESE EQUATIONS TO REDUCE

03:21:00.715 --> 03:21:03.351
THE GRENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS-

03:21:03.418 --> 03:21:04.652
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON A LINEAR

03:21:04.719 --> 03:21:06.154
ECONOMY WHERE EXTRACTING USING

03:21:06.220 --> 03:21:08.222
DISPOSING WHICH MEANS IS

03:21:08.289 --> 03:21:09.724
GREENHOUSE GASES OF TRENT

03:21:09.791 --> 03:21:11.626
CREATING IT GREENHOUSE GASES OF

03:21:11.692 --> 03:21:13.561
TRANSPORTING IT IN GREENHOUSE

03:21:13.628 --> 03:21:15.797
GASES OF THROWING IT AWAY WE

03:21:15.863 --> 03:21:17.265
NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE USE

03:21:17.331 --> 03:21:19.233
OUR RESOURCES HOW WE CAN TAKE

03:21:19.300 --> 03:21:21.436
THIS VALUABLE STUFF AND RE USE

03:21:21.502 --> 03:21:23.037
IT AND KEEP IT AS CLOSE AS

03:21:23.104 --> 03:21:25.273
POSSIBLE IN A SMALLER CIRCLE-

03:21:25.339 --> 03:21:27.141
IF WE CAN START OPENING THE

03:21:27.208 --> 03:21:28.576
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT I THINK

03:21:28.643 --> 03:21:29.677
THAT WOULD BE REALLY REALLY

03:21:29.744 --> 03:21:31.446
VALUABLE. TO OTHER THINGS APART

03:21:31.512 --> 03:21:34.182

INTERESTED IN TRANSIT. AND

03:21:47.361 --> 03:21:48.696
LISTEN TO A CONVERSATION TODAY

03:21:48.763 --> 03:21:51.566
I'M WONDERING WHY YOU'RE

03:21:51.632 --> 03:21:52.133
DANCING AROUND THE ISSUE OF

03:21:52.200 --> 03:21:54.569
FUNDING. THERE'S A REALLY

03:21:54.635 --> 03:21:57.505
SIMPLE WAY TO FUND THIS STUFF

03:21:57.572 --> 03:21:59.874
IS TO PUT A PRICE ON CARBON

03:21:59.941 --> 03:22:04.278
EMISSIONS. PUT A PRICE ON

03:22:04.345 --> 03:22:06.781
CARBON EMISSIONS. CREATE A

03:22:06.848 --> 03:22:08.316
BORDER ADJUSTMENT FOR PEOPLE

03:22:08.382 --> 03:22:10.418
THAT ARE EXPORTING GOODS

03:22:10.485 --> 03:22:13.554
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. AND THEN

03:22:13.621 --> 03:22:16.824
REBATE THE REVENUES TO THE

03:22:16.891 --> 03:22:19.427
POPULATION SODA SWISHES THE

03:22:19.494 --> 03:22:23.664
IMPACT. I A I REALLY DON'T

03:22:23.731 --> 03:22:25.500
UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS ALL

03:22:25.566 --> 03:22:27.535
THIS TALK ABOUT MAKING IT SHINY

03:22:27.602 --> 03:22:30.538
AND IN DO SEEING PEOPLE TO TRY
