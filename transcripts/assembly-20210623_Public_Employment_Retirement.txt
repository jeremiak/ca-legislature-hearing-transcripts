THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES REPLACE ON CALL THE BILL HAS FIVE ALL TO BE PLACED ON CALL WE'RE NOT MOVING ON THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA STARTING WITH SB SEVENTY SIXTH INTERNAL SEN. YOU MAY PRESENT WHEN READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND I'LL PUT IT THIS WAY I'M BACK. I'VE BEEN PERSISTENT WITH THIS BILL HUMAN RELATIONS AND FINANCE OF NOT LIKE THAT. THEY THINK IT GIVES UP SOME OF THEIR AUTHORITY AND THE BARGAINING PROCESS I GUESS. BUT THESE EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES ARE KIND OF THE FORGOTTEN INDIVIDUALS. THEY THROUGH THEIR CAREERS AGREED TO ADVANCE IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. BUT IT OFTEN DOESN'T NECESSARILY HELP THEM. THEY GET THE HEADACHES OF THAT HIGHER RESPONSIBILITY. BUT SOME OF THE BENEFITS THAT THE- REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES RECEIVED THEY DO NOT. THIS BILL TRIES TO HELP THEM. UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES IF THEY HAVE A DISAGREEMENT. THEIR ONLY RECOURSE. IS THE COURTS. THEY CAN GO TO THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD. BUT THESE ARE OFTEN ROUTINELY REJECTED. SO THIS CLASS OF EMPLOYEES IS GREATLY I WOULD ARGUE DISADVANTAGED. AND THEN AT THEIR THE KEY EMPLOYEES THE MANAGERS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. TO MAKE OUR GOVERNMENT WORK. THERE DISADVANTAGED SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IF DREAMLAND A GRIEVANCE PROCESS. WE ALLOW THE EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. AFTER THEY'VE EXHAUSTED THE NORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCESS. THEY CAN REQUEST ARBITRATION. I'M NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN A FAN OF ARBITRATION BUT IN THIS CASE I SEE ITS APPLICATION. THE CLASSROOM POLICIES THAT ARE MOST DESERVING. OF THAT BENEFIT NOW. THE AND AS THE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A SPIRE THE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY MANAGEMENT. THEY CAN HAVE SOME HOPE THAT THEY WON'T BE SO LONELY. AS I SAY I THINK THE INTEREST OF THE- APARTMENTS FINANCE IN HR WITH THE PASSED THROUGH JUST TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN. LEVERAGE IN THE PROCESS. BUT THEY'RE NOT THAT MANY OF THE EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. AND I DO NOT THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE AN ONEROUS BURDEN. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL THAT WE'VE ADDED A FIVE YEAR SUNSET. PHIL THERE CAN BE A RE EXAMINATION IF WE DON'T THINK THIS IS WORKING WELL. IN FIVE YEARS HALF. BUT IT WILL SPARE US I WOULD ARGUE NEEDLESS LITIGATION. AND I THINK THE DISADVANTAGE THAT PLEASE EXPLODED EMPLOYEES FEEL. I'D ASK IF YOU'D BE SO KIND AS TO LET THIS BILL MOVE ON AS WE HAVE BEFORE. AND FINALLY GAVE SOME HOPE TO OR EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES JOHN LEVEL REPRESENTS THE CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND SHAYLA SILVA DIFFERENTIATION THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPERVISORS THAT WOULD BE OUR WITNESSES MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU SENATOR- WHAT'S THE FIRST UP OUR PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT OUR JUNGLE LEVEL. OPERATOR.

OKAY THANK YOU- JOHN LEVEL WITH THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION. WE WANT TO COMMAND- CENTER NIELSEN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. THIS BILL WILL- CREATE. AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE PROBLEMS AND GRIEVANCES CAN BE SOLVED QUICKLY AND WE'RE GONNA A MINIMAL COST. RIGHT NOW IS SENATOR NIELSEN POINTS OUT. ALEX ARE JUST ROUTINELY REJECTS GRIEVANCES WHY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BUT THEN THE OPTION IS TO GO TO LITIGATION. AND LITIGATION IS VERY EXPENSIVE. IN OUR ORGANIZATION THE AVERAGE LITIGATION COST IS ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE WOULD SUBMIT BUT BUT BUT BUT- STATE BEARS THAT SIMILAR COST HAND WITH LITIGATION SOMETIMES CASES GET. STRUNG OUT WHERE THE DAMAGES INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY BY THE RECENT WALKER IN CASE WHERE THE STATE IS LOOKING AT POTENTIAL DAMAGES OF OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- THERE'S SOME. WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT EFFECT CASE HAD GONE TO ARBITRATION THE OTHER THING THIS BILL DOES IN THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IS IT COURAGE'S THE PARTIES TO TRY AND SOLVE- DISPUTES WHY BECAUSE OF THE BILL PROVIDES THAT THE LOSER MUST PAY FOR THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION. SO HERE FOR A CCSO FILES A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION. AND CAL H. R. LOOKS AT IT- AND THEY HAVE TO- DETERMINE OKAY ARE WE GOING TO WIN THIS ONE OR NOT. ANALYSTS ARE A 100% SURE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THEY'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND TRY AND WORK OUT A SETTLEMENT. CCSO IS IN THE SAME BOAT SO THE GENIUS OF THIS BILL. IS THAT IT PROVIDES FOR ARBITRATION. WHICH IS LESS EXPENSE OF THE MEDICATION AND QUICKER BUT ALL IN. THE PARTY. TO TRY AND INTERPRET OF THE- WORKOUT- SETTLEMENT CAN WE PUT THIS. INPUT RECENT- SENATOR- INTO.

ANYTHING FURTHER THERE ARE NO NEW REQUIREMENTS OFFER THE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS- JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- ESPECIALLY DURING EMERGENCIES HAVING ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL.

OUR NEXT PRIMARY SUPPORT IS LIBBY SANCHEZ. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LED THE PHANTASM TOGETHER THAT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE IT IS OUR SINCEREST HOPE THAT THE RESULT OF THE S. B. TWO SEVENTY WILL BE THAT UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES ARISING OUT OF FIVE VIOLATIONS OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT. NO LONGER HAVE TO BE FILED AND THAT THE ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS PROVISIONS OF THE MEASURE WILL NEVER HAVE TO BE RELIED UPON. THE BILL IS UNFORTUNATELY NECESSARY HOWEVER BECAUSE IN THE SHORT TIME THAT GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SOME EMPLOYERS HAVE SIMPLY BEEN UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH A STRAIGHT FORWARD AND NOT UNDULY BURDENSOME OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED THEREIN. IT'S BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE LACK OF COMPLIANCE IS DUE ONLY TO THE EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO SCORE COMPLIANCE WITH IMPUNITY IN OTHER WORDS NO ONE'S AFRAID OF THE REPERCUSSIONS OF VIOLATION BECAUSE THERE REALLY ARE NOT. EXCEPT OF COURSE THE PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR UNIONS WHO ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN NUMEROUS WAYS BY THE ISRAELIS AND- THE INTENT OF LABOR PROTECTIONS AT THE LEVEL AND ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT. IN THE EQUALISING MANNER THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED THE BILL A FABLESS IS A THOUGHTFUL AND TRULY BALANCED APPROACH TO REMEDYING THE PROBLEM. FIRST THE BILL CONTAINS CONTINUES TO BE IN THE EMPLOYERS COURT WHERE THE EMPLOYER CAN COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND NOTHING HAPPENS NO UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE NO POTENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS. BACK IN THE BILL ENCOURAGES RESOLUTION BY PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO CARE AND ESTABLISHING A NEUTRAL ATTORNEY FEE STRUCTURE AGAIN THE BILL WORK HOPEFULLY OPTIMISTIC WILL RARELY IF EVER HAVE TO BE YEARS BUT WITHOUT IT THE PRODUCTION OF THE LEGISLATURE THOUGHT THEY WERE IMPARTING TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS. UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT WILL CONTINUE TO BE ALL BUT ILLUSORY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. NESTLED WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM. I SEE A COUPLE. THEIR CELL COMING UP TO LIKE. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ORDER. AND GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID CHIU CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ASSOCIATION ARE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL IN SUPPORT AND THANKFUL TO SUNDRESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KRISTEN BROWN WITH CFTA UNION OF EDUCATORS AND CLASSIFY PROFESSIONALS HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PRODUCTION WAS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. NEXT REMOVED WITNESSES OPPOSITION WE HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS JASON SMELSER OPERATOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM HERE- THE BIGOTRY CARE NUMBERS- MY NAME IS JACOB SMELTER AND I'M HERE TODAY TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF PRISM PUBLIC RISK INNOVATION SOLUTIONS IN MANAGEMENT FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY VERY CLEARLY THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY THE AUTHORED THE SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS ARE FRUSTRATED BY PUBLIC EMPLOYERS YOU'RE SIMPLY FAILING TO DO THE JOB THAT'S REQUIRED OF THEM UNDER THE LAW. THAT THERE ARE THOSE EMPLOYERS- WE CAN SEE WHY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO APPLY A REASONABLE MONETARY PENALTY IN THAT SCENARIO TO DRIVE- PERFORMANCE- WE HAVE NO DEBATE. AT ALL ON THAT FRONT. WE WOULD ARGUE THOUGH- IS THAT THE BILL GOES TOO FAR BY APPLYING THESE PENALTIES FOR INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE DATA THAT'S PROVIDED TO A PUBLIC EMPLOYER PROVIDED BY A PUBLIC EMPLOYER WHO'S ATTEMPTING TO COMPLY IN GOOD FAITH. SO THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL- IS THAT A DATA INTEGRITY TO EXIST ACROSS EVERY TYPE OF GOVERNMENT PRIVATE BODY. DATA INTEGRITY CHALLENGES DATA ERRORS ARE DIVING INTO A FUTURE. OF DATA SETS NOT A BUG- THIS ISN'T NEWS TO ANYBODY WHO'S MANAGE DATA- THE PROBLEM WITH SB TWO SEVENTY IN PARTICULAR THAT IT ONLY ALLOWS THREE- CORRECTIONS AND A YEAR RIGHT TO CURE THREE TIMES IN A YEAR OR SO. WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM THREE TIMES SHOULD BE ENOUGH RIGHT WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THAT COUNTY I'LL JUST TAKE MY COUNTY THAT I LIVE IT. OTHER TWENTY SIX BARGAINING UNITS- IF YOU TAKE ALL OF THE REPORTS THAT ARE UNDER THE LAW THAT'S THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY FILINGS IN A YEAR. OF WHICH THERE COULD BE A SINGLE DATA ERROR IN EACH ONE THERE WILL BE I GUARANTEE YOU THERE WILL BE A DATA ERROR IN EACH ONE. SO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE YEAH THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN- WOULD BE TECH TECHNICALLY UNDER THE BILL SUBJECT TO PENALTIES- GIVE YOU TAKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TWENTY ONE BARGAINING UNITS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN TOTAL FILINGS. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOURTEEN STATEWIDE BARGAINING UNIT SEVENTEEN CAMPUS SPECIFIC BARGAINING UNITS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY. ANNUAL FILINGS THEY CAN CORRECT DATA ERRORS WHICH SHOULD BE EXPECTED ONLY THREE TIMES AROSE DURING THE PENALTY. WE JUST CAN'T SUPPORT THAT-% UNDER THE CURRENT. STRUCTURE OF THE BILL BUT AGAIN WE WOULD NOT OPPOSE THE BILL THAT SIMPLY IMPOSE PENALTIES ON EMPLOYERS. WHO FAIL TO COMPLY A FULL STOP- SO WITH THAT- THAT IS SHARED MEMBERS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE. TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MESSAOUD. WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM IN OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU OPERATOR WILL BRING THAT TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BUT JUST WITH THE SENATOR I'M ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT THE DATA ERRORS- WELL SIR YOU'RE ALLOWED THREE DATA ERRORS. I THINK IT'S THREE- ERRORS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THERE'S A TEN DAY CURE PERIOD NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES SO THIS IS NOT YOU GET THREE CHANCES AND AFTER THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU YOU YOU HAVE- A TEN DAY CURE PERIOD- AND YOU KNOW THE POINT OF THIS IS LOOK THIS IS. IF IT WERE TO BE SO SERIOUS AS TO IMPOSE THE MAXIMUM PENALTY THAT'S MONEY THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE PUBLIC EMPLOYER THAT'S NOT WITH YOUR ORGANIZATION'S THE REPRESENTATIVES ARE LOOKING FOR THEY'RE LOOKING TO FIX THE PROBLEM GET THEIR ATTENTION TO FIX THE PROBLEM SO. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WHERE THEY'RE GONNA BE WAITING AND WISHING AND HOPING THAT THERE IS ERROR SO THAT THEY CAN- GOTCHA GOTCHA AGAIN- SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE MAXIMUM PENALTY IS TEN THOUSAND THE PURPOSE GOING TO LOOK THROUGH T ALL. WHAT'S THE BUDGET OF THE EMPLOYER THE SEVERITY ANY PRIOR HISTORY SO I THINK WE'RE JUST MAKING THE MAKING THE OPPOSITION'S MAKING TOO MUCH OF A BIG DEAL THEY REALLY OUGHT TO BE FIGURING OUT HOW TO GIVE. ACCURATE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY JUST TO GIVE A REPORT. OUT OF SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN HUNDRED EMPLOYERS TO IN FORTY TWO DIDN'T EVEN SUBMIT ANYTHING. FORGET THE A MISTAKE THEN SUBMIT ANYTHING. SO I AND SOME OF THEM HAVE NEVER DONE IT SINCE THE LAW WAS PASSED SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT. AN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. I CARE.

FORTY ONE ON CALL CENTER THAT'S BILLS FORTY ONE AND SOME CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. NEXT UP WE'RE MOVING ON TO- SB TWO SEVENTY EIGHT THE CENTER LEYVA. MARKET IN THE CZECH CARE AFTERNOON MEMBERS EITHER A SUMMER COOPER I WAS THINKING IN MY SEVEN YEARS HERE THIS MIGHT BE THE FIRST TIME I PRESENTED. A BILL IN FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE HOW COULD NOT BE ACTED. HOW COULD THAT BE GOOD LUCK. ARTLESS YES. I SHOULD BE WORRIED A LITTLE BIT LIKE A REALLY GOOD LOOK IT. AS B. TWO SEVENTY EIGHT PROTECTS THE PROMISED AND PAID FOR REQUIRE RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF CALPERS MEMBERS THAT MAKING SURE THAT NO HARM COMES TO RETIREE FOR ANY COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED PENSIONABLE COMPENSATION THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE SYSTEM. THIS MAJOR RESPONSE IT TO CASES IN WHICH PENSIONABLE COMPENSATION AVERAGE QUITE RETIRED EMPLOYEES IS RETROACTIVELY DEEMED DISALLOWED BY CALPERS. IN THESE INSTANCES THE RETIRED EMPLOYEES ARE FORCED TO PAY BACK THE TOTAL OVERPAYMENT AMOUNT IS WILL SUFFER PERMANENT REDUCTIONS TO THEIR PENSIONS. MANY RETIREES LIVE ON FIXED INCOMES AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED CUTS TO THEIR BENEFITS AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN LONG AFTER THEY'VE RETIRED. SB TWO SEVENTY EIGHT GIVES RETIREES IMPORTANT PEACE OF MIND THAT THE RETIREMENT THAT THEY EARNED AND PAID FOR OVER A LIFETIME OF PUBLIC SERVICE WILL CONSISTENTLY BE THERE THROUGHOUT THE RETIREMENT YEARS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A PROCESS FOR CALPERS EMPLOYERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT RETIREE BENEFITS AND PREVENT THESE INSTANCES FROM EVER HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. SB TWO SEVENTY EIGHT ALSO COMPELS EMPLOYERS TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE PROMISE RETIREES AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM ANY REDUCTIONS TO THE RETIREMENT AS A RESULT OF DISALLOWED COMPENSATION. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT AS DOUG SUBER'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS MEMBERS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER SUBER'S. THANK YOU WITH THE CARE AND MEMBERS. OF THE HALF OF CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THANKS ARE LIVE UP FOR ONGOING LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE THIS ISSUE FIRST CAME TO THE C. P. AFTER. A FIREFIGHTER WHO WAS. EMPLOYED BY THE CITY OF DAVID FOR TIRED AFTER SERVING THE PUBLIC FOR THIRTY YEARS FIVE YEARS INTO HER RETIREMENT- SHE WAS NOTIFIED BY CALPERS THAT REPORTED SPECIAL COMPENSATION BY- THE CITY WAS DETERMINED TO BE DISALLOWED. PLAN WHEN CALPERS NOTIFIED SORRY WHEN CALPERS NOTIFIED THE RETIREE- THAT THERE WAS AN OVERPAYMENT THE CITY. EXCUSE ME CALPERS NOT DID NOT SEEK THE REPAYMENT FROM THE CITY THEY REAP SOUGHT THAT PAYMENT FROM THE RETIRED FIREFIGHTER. IT WAS A LUMP SUM OF FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HER RETIREMENT GOING FORWARD. SO WE BELIEVE THIS BILL. REALLY WILL PROTECT THE RETIREES- THAT ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED TO THE FIREFIGHTER AND DAVIS LIKE MANY RETIREES ON A FIREFIGHTER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER SCHOOL EMPLOYEE RETIRES THEY WERE LYING TO FIX MONTHS MONTHLY PENSION TO MEET THEIR DAY TO DAY NEEDS. AND MANY RETIREES INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL DO NOT HAVE ACCESS OR GET SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS SO THIS IS REALLY THERE ONE SOURCE OF INCOME. SO THIS BILL WILL PROTECT THOSE RETIREES AND IN THERE ARE CLEAR RULES AROUND-SPECIAL COMPENSATION- THE RETIREES- CAN BARGAIN FOR AND THOSE ARE LIKE HAZARD PAY LONGEVITY PAY EDUCATIONAL INCENTIVE PAY. AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL REALLY ENSURE THAT WHEN THOSE THINGS ARE BARGAINED AND PAID FOR- THEY WILL BE MAINTAINED AS PROMISED AND FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR OB. THANK YOU THANK YOU.

MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS QUEUED UP THANK YOU. WILL BRING BACK THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE DOUBLE BILL YES. SO. I HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS NOW. WHEN CALPERS. CALCULATES THE BENEFITS THE EMPLOYEE WHOEVER THEY MAY BE FIGURES THAT'S THE LAW THAT'S IT THEY'RE DONE. I WOULD ACCEPT THAT IF I WAS. THE EMPLOYEE SO. WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO FIGURE THIS OUT. NUMBER ONE. THE DIFFERENT CITIES AND JURISDICTIONS THAT. NEED TO KNOW. WHAT THEY DID. IN THE PAST PRESENT OR FUTURE. CALPERS IS ONLY DOING THEIR JOB. THEIR JOB IS TO COLLECT MONEY AND IF THERE'S A SHORTFALL. THEY'RE JUST DOING THEIR JOB. SO THE POINT I'M MAKING IS I WILL. SUPPORT THIS BILL ASSEMBLY OUT OF JUSTICE YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS USE THE WORD JUSTICE TODAY. BUT THE EMPLOYEE. ONLY DOES NINE OUT OF TEN TIMES WHAT THEY'RE TOLD. AND IF THEY'RE GETTING MONEY. FROM THE STATE FOR THEIR HARD WORK THEY ASSUME IT'S A CORRECT AMOUNT. SO WHY SHOULD THEY BE ON THE HOOK FOR THE DIFFERENCE IT SHOULD BE THE CITIES AND COUNTIES AND ENTITIES. THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO FIGURE THIS OUT SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN MY MIND ONLY ONE PERSON'S MIND. IS A LEVEL OF INCOMPETENCE HERE THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU THE SEATTLE THANK YOU MR VOEPEL. I HAVE A TENDENCY TO AGREE WITH US SOME OF THE POINTS MR VOEPEL- I WAS MAKING- YOUR BOTTOM LINE IS EMPLOYEES DON'T FIGURE OUT THEIR RETIREMENT. DíAS THAT'S A- PRODUCT OF THE WORK OF THE CITY AND CALPERS TOGETHER IN CALPERS ONLY PUTS TOGETHER WITH THE CITY HERE. I WOULD CALL THIS THE GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME BILL. BECAUSE IF YOU GET IT RIGHT FIRST TIME THE NOBODY HAS TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES CAN PLAN THEIR RETIREMENT ACCORDINGLY. AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS DO WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO- BUT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO GO ON. BY IF A MISTAKE IS MADE IT IS UP TO THE PERSONS THAT MAKE THE MISTAKE. TO RIGHT THAT WRONG. AND HE CAN'T DROP IN THE LAP OF SOMEBODY WHO HAD NO PART OF FIGURING OUT THE FORMULA FIRST PLACE. SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW IT HAS AFFECTED SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE-YEAH AND YOU KNOW TO THE CITIES I UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITION- YOU KNOW NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE TO PAY BUT SOMEBODY PAYS FOR MISTAKES. AND IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT THOSE LABOR ATTORNEYS ARE FOR THEY ARE HIRED BY CITIES IS TO MAKE SURE YOU DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME- SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR COOLEY. I JUST WANT TO JOIN ON. THE COMMENTS OF BOTH MY COLLEAGUES I THINK- EXORCISMS EXISTS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE. THAT THEY CAN- ENJOY RETIREMENT AND SECURITY RETIREMENT WELL THAT'S A BENEFACTION FOR THEM WELL THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR THEM IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE ECONOMY. BECAUSE THAT MEANS EVEN A DOWNTURN. A SENIOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEE CAN ACTUALLY OPT TO RETIRE- FOR WHATEVER REASON THE MOTIVATES THIS OPENS UP NEW JOBS TO PEOPLE IN THE ORGANIZATION. SO THAT IN GENERAL PENSION SYSTEMS ARE GOOD FOR THE WHOLE ECONOMY. THEY ALLOW FOR THE RENEWAL OF ORGANIZATIONS BRINGING PEOPLE AND SO. MY POINT IS THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS A- THERE IS A PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE GENERAL HEALTH OF THE LAW. IS TO SUPPORT THE WORKER AND TAKE THE BURDEN OFF THEM PROVIDE THEM WITH BENEFITS. IF WE DON'T HAVE A FIX LIKE THIS. IT SORT OF PUTS ON THE WORKER. THE BURDEN OF THE MISCALCULATION AND I AGREE- IT HELPS PEOPLE PLAN THEIR BENEFITS AS MY OTHER COLLEAGUES JUST STATED AND IT ALSO. I THINK THE ONE PERSON IS REALLY MONITORING THEIR THE STATE OF THEIR RETIREMENT WHAT THEY PROJECT FOR THE RETIREMENT IS THE WORKER TRYING TO MEASURE WHAT THEY WISH TO DO. I APPRECIATE THEIR FOR THE FACT THAT IN THE BILL SECTION ONE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE EXAMPLE FIREFIGHTER THAT THOUGHT IT WAS ON TRACK AND IN FIVE YEARS IN RETIREMENT. THEY TRY TO RE COMPUTE FULL MONEY BACK. THIS WAY ABSENCE INDIVIDUAL APPLE KERR. AND FOR THE PERSON'S NOT RETIRED. IF THERE WAS A MATERIAL ERROR THAT HAD COME TO LIGHT. THEY ACTED IN LIKE IT THEY MIGHT CONSIDER VOTE WITH THEIR FEET AND SEEK ANOTHER THAT'S RIGHT SETTING IN WHICH TO WORK. FOR RETIREMENT INTEREST AND- SO ON EVERY LEVEL THIS IS VERY VERY BAD FOR FOLKS IN THE WORKFORCE. AND I AGREE IT IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS ND TO GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SO I JOIN IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL IS OUR EMOTIONAL DID YOU. MOTION MAY. SECOND EVOLUTION A SECOND CONSIDER THINGS WILL BRING THIS BILL FOR THIS IMPORTANT DETECTOR OF THE THIS- WEIRD IT DEFINED BENEFIT. YEAH THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING DEFINED BENEFIT YOU WORK A CERTAIN TIME. AND YOU TOLD ME TO MAKE THE SALARY TO COME BACK. IT'S REALLY DISHEARTENING AND IN SOME CASES AND WE THINK ABOUT THIS THE AVERAGE PERS RETIREMENT. IS THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. BEFORE TAXES THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS BEFORE TAXES. IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY. IF YOUR TEACHER IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. A YEAR AND MOST OF THOSE TEACHERS ARE WOMEN. SO TO REALLY GO BACK IN AND TRY TO CALL THAT MONEY BACK IS NOT RIGHT. THE ENTITIES THE CITIES COUNTIES. THEY GOT DO A BETTER JOB OF COMPUTING. SO WHAT DO YOU DOUBLE CHECK AND TRIPLE CHECK IT. IT'S ALL ON YOU. BUT TO PUT ON THE BACK OF THE EMPLOYEES IS WRONG- THIS BILL THIS BILL DOESN'T ENJOY A DO PASS- SO WE GOT A FIRST THE SECOND. SECRETARY FOR ME OF LOCAL POLICE. CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING ALL OF OUR LOCAL SENATOR THANK. I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT THE WORKER- I THOUGHT ON A PENSION FUND FOR TWELVE YEARS BEFORE RUNNING FOR OFFICE. AND THE PERSON OR THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE CALCULATIONS WE TOLD THEM YOU NEED TO DOUBLE TRIPLE QUADRUPLE CHECK THOSE CALCULATIONS. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MAKING LIFE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT WE TELL THEM AND FOR ALL OF THE EMPLOYERS. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION THEY HAVE THE ABILITIES TO SUBMIT THOSE. DEMO USE AND CBA'S TO CALPERS AND CALPERS HAS TO GIVE THEM A RESPONSE WITHIN NINETY DAYS AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THERE'S ANY DISALLOWED COMPENSATION IN THERE. SO THERE IS A WAY TO DO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE BENEFITS BUT I JUST WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR LOOKING OUT FOR WORKING PEOPLE THANK YOU VERY-MUCH. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THOUGHT. THANK YOU. RUSSELL PLEASE. ON SENATE BILL TWO SEVEN EIGHT BY SENATOR LEYVA THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS COOPER HI COOPER HI VOEPEL RIGHT VOEPEL AYE CALDERON CALDERON HI COOLEY COOLEY I O'DONNELL RODRIGUEZ.

TO HAVE A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF SERVICE THEY CAN PROVIDE TO THEIR UNION- I THINK THAT THERE IS A WHILE WE HAVE A DEBATE SOMETIMES IN THIS HOUSE ABOUT TERM LIMITS I THINK WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE IS IN LEADERSHIP. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO RUN AND BE DULY ELECTED TO LEADERSHIP AND THEIR EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS AND EXPERIENCE BE GETS BETTER ORGANIZATIONS BETTER AND MORE EFFICACIOUS ORGANIZATIONS I CAN REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE MUCH BETTER SO WHY CURRENT LAW PUTS A CHILL ON THAT SERVICE WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PROVIDING THAT SERVICE AS AN ELECTED LEADER. AND THE RETIREMENT SECURITY IS A INTERESTING QUICK WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT THIS BILL IS HERE TO FIX AND REMEDY THAT SITUATION SO THAT INDIVIDUALS IF THEY ARE ELECTED CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THESE GREAT ROLES AND BRING THAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM AND- HOPEFULLY DO A BETTER JOB SO WE THANK YOU AND ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE- THIS AFTERNOON.

ELEVEN FINNER CORTESE. FOR I'M SORRY FOR LEVEL EXCUSE ME AS BEFORE ELEVEN. GOOD AFTERNOON THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE POLICE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER THEY SHOULD SAY PERCENT OF SB FOUR ELEVEN THE WORK AFTER RETIREMENT ACT SB FOUR ELEVEN WILL FOLLOW CALPERS STAFF TO WORK WITH RETIRED MEMBERS IN POOREST RESOLVE WORKING AFTER RETIREMENT VIOLATIONS INEFFICIENT AND AGREEABLE MANNER. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS A CALPERS RETIREE TO RETURN TO WORK WITH THE CALPERS EMPLOYER UNDER CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AS A THANK. ALL OF YOU KNOW- AND AS YOU ALSO KNOW THESE RETIREES- ALSO. KNOWN AS RETIRED IN NEWTON AND THEY'RE LIMITED TO NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOURS OF WORK PER YEAR. HAVE SOME RETIREES OF COURSE DO THIS TO SUPPLEMENT THE RETIREMENT INCOME WHILE OTHERS FEEL IN THE CENTRAL VACANCIES DURING AN EMERGENCY TO ENSURE-ADEQUATE STAFFING. FOR ME TEMPORARILY STUFF MAKING POSITIONS WHEN NEEDED. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THESE RETIREES ARE CURRENTLY FACING SIGNIFICANT. AND COMPOUNDING PENALTIES FOR UNINTENTIONALLY GOING OVER. THEIR CURRENT LIMITATION UNDER SIXTY HOURS. FOR INSTANCE THEY WEREN'T AWARE OF THIS LIMITATION REPORTER MOVE IN A VARIETY MISINFORM THE TERMS OF THEIR EARLY TOTALS. SB FOUR ELEVEN WOULD SIMPLY. GRANT THE CALPERS BOARD THE AUTHORITY TO WAIVE OR REDUCE FINES FOR THOSE RETIREES IN THE VERTICALLY OVER THE NINERS SIXTY ARGUMENT BASED ON THE ACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS OF THAT PARTICULAR VIOLATION. WITHOUT HAVING TO FORCE A RETIREE TO REINSTATE BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. THIS WILL PUT AN END TO WHAT IN SOME CASES CAN AMOUNT TO AN EGREGIOUS INCOMERS ARE RETIREES WHO COMPOUNDING IN INCREASE PENALTIES AND INSTEAD. ALLOW FOR MORE SWIFT AND EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION TO THESE UNINTENTIONAL VIOLATIONS. OUR RETIREES DESERVE RESPECT OF COURSE PEACE OF MIND AND A SENSE OF SECURITY FOR THEIR FUTURE. AS A CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR STATE SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME OF SUCH SOCIAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL AS WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH. THE LIKE TO NOTE- THAT SPONSORING THIS BILL IS A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. AND SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM CALPERS ALONG WITH OTHERS. WITH US TODAY IS DAVID CHIU TARA DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND HE'S HERE IN PERSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS NOT THE ISSUE PARA THANK. PLEASE GO AHEAD IT IS INDEED A DEAL SORRY. AT THE MASTERS OF IT MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW MAKES IT DIFFICULT RECKON RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER- THIS MOMENT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LIKE ME MY NAME IS DAVID APART AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. CSEA IS THE SPONSOR US BEFORE ELEVEN BECAUSE THE BILL REPRESENTS A MOVE TOWARD. FAIRNESS FOR RETIREES FOR THE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM. KNOWN AS CALPERS. AS YOU MAY KNOW. THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE- PENSION REFORM ACT KNOWN AS PETRA. ALLOWS RETIREES TO WORK FOR A PUBLIC EMPLOYER AFTER RETIREMENT. SO LONG IS THE WAIT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER RETIRING TO RETURN TO WORK AND- THEY WORK NO MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOURS PER FISCAL YEAR. IF RETIREES EXCEED THE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOUR LIMIT UNDER CURRENT LAW. CALPERS IS TECHNICALLY FORCED TO REINSTATE THEM AS ACTIVE MEMBERS. A PERSON WHO HAS DEDICATED YEARS OF THEIR LIFE TO OUR STATE. AND IN THE CASE OF CSEA MEMBERS TO STUDENTS IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. IS THEN REQUIRED TO PAY BACK ALL OF THEIR KERN RETIREE BENEFITS THEY RECEIVED AFTER EXCEEDING THE HOUR LIMIT BY EVEN JUST ONE HOUR. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE RULES THAT RETIREES MUST FOLLOW. BUT THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED PUNISHMENT HERE OFTEN DOES NOT FIT THE CRIME. CSEA RETIREES HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PAY BACK SIX FIGURES OF THEIR HARD EARNED RETIREE BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY WERE MISINFORMED OR MISLED BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. PEOPLE LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME WHO COUNT ON THE PENSION THEY'VE EARNED HAVE FACED MORTGAGING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS WHO HAS CENTER COURT AS HE MENTIONED OFTEN BIGGER RETIREES TO COME BACK AND FILL CRITICAL NEEDS THEN FAILED TO PROMPTLY REPORT THEIR HOURS. TO CALPERS AND NOTIFY THE RETIREE THEY'VE CROSSED THE NINE HUNDRED SIXTY OUR THRESHOLD. SB FOUR ELEVEN WOULD GIVE CALPERS THE ABILITY TO CONSIDER THESE SORTS OF MITIGATING FACTORS. IN DETERMINING WHETHER RETIREE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE REINSTATED AND HAVE TO PAY BACK THE EARNED BENEFITS OR- IF THERE'S A MORE REASONABLE SOLUTION. FOR RETIREES EXCEEDED THE CAP CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE. TO GIVE CALPERS THAT LIMITED DISCRETION TO CONSIDER THE NEW WANTS AND FAIRNESS OF EACH CASE. CSEA RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE ON AS BEFORE ELEVEN AND THANKS SENATOR CORTEZ HE- FOR AUTHORING THE BILL I WILL- JUST KNOW QUICKLY.

TO OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT NOT USED TO BEING SO CLOSE HERE ALL RIGHT SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIR HOW MEMBERS TODAY PRESENT SB FOUR TWENTY TWO A BILL THAT WILL SAVE THE STATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PERSONNEL COSTS IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES BY EXTENDING WORKFORCE FLEXIBILITY TO CIVIL SERVICE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. SB FOUR TWENTY TO SELL THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL REGISTRY COMPOSED OF STATE EMPLOYEES THAT SERVE. THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS HAD THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION. THE BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS CURRENT LABOR LAWS THAT LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF HOURS THE CIVIL SERVICE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL CAN PERFORM BEFORE THE STATE IS REQUIRED TO USE MORE COSTLY. THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS TRADITIONAL SERVICES. UNDER THE CURRENT MODEL THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS CHARGE THE STATE'S SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOR SERVICES COMPARED THESE TO THE USE OF EXISTING STATE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. IT'S REGISTRY HAS BEEN PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE COUNTY LOS ANGELES. THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS LAUNCHED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN RESULTING IN SAVINGS OF OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS BILL ENSURES FURTHER SAVINGS BY LIMITING ADDITIONAL HOURS SIR BY PARTICIPANTS. THE MAXIMUM TWENTY FOUR HOURS A WEEK. PARTICIPATION IN THE REGISTRY WILL ALSO CONSTITUTE TEMPORARY WORK AND REGISTRY PARTICIPANTS WILL FOREGO ANY EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ON TRADITIONAL HOURS. FURTHERMORE ADDITIONAL HOURS NOT BE COUNTED TOWARD THE CALCULATION OF THE EMPLOYEES PENSION. SB FOUR TWENTY TWO IS A SENSIBLE COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO SAVING THE STATE MONEY MATURING TO THE STATE MAINTAINS A COTTON WOULD CARE FOR ITS PATIENTS. PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL SUNSET ON JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN I HAVE- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT DR KIM AND DR STUART FUSSY. PRESIDENT THE UNION AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS TO SPEAK MORE ON THIS ISSUE AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS.

ADD DOCTOR PAN SAID THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS PRODUCING BETTER CONTINUITY OF CARE. FOR CALIFORNIA'S INMATES AND HOSPITALIZED MENTALLY ILL. AND IT WILL SAVE TAXPAYERS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. CONTRACTING OUT OF STATE EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE POSITIONS. HAS REMAINED A PROBLEM FOR DECADES IN THE STATE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. I TESTIFIED I RECOMMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE PRETEND PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS. TO MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM. AND- THE REGISTRY WAS ONE OF THEM. HI MORE HOPEFUL. THE STATE AND PD HAVE COLLABORATED RECENTLY IN A RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STUDY OVER THE PAST. NINE MONTHS. IN THIS JOINT REPORT STATISTICS HAVE SHOWN A FEDERALLY INCREASING AMOUNT OF MONEY. BEING SPENT ON PRIVATE HEALTH CARE CONTRACTORS TO BACK FILL THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POSITION VACANCIES IN CDCR AND D. S. H. THE STATE HOSPITALS. ONE CONTRACTOR IT MADE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AT ONE. AND ONE MONTH. THE STATE PAID CONTRACTORS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR BARGAINING SIXTEEN BARKING AT SIXTEEN WORK. AND MILLIONS MORE ONE CONTRACTING OUT BARGAINING NINETEEN PSYCHOLOGISTS SOCIAL WORKERS PHARMACISTS. BUT COLEMAN COURT SPECIAL MASTERS REPORTED TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REQUIRE GREAT RECOMMENDED BETTER SALARY OPPORTUNITIES. TO RETAIN OUR STATE CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS. THANK YOU WAITING AGO SHARED PREVIOUSLY ADDITIONAL APPOINTMENT LANGUAGE IN A TEMPLE YOU WITH THE STATE WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE EXTRA MANPOWER BY THE STATE EMPLOYEES. AT A BASE SALARY WAIT WHICH WAS ONE HALF OF A PRIVATE CONTRACT BUT THAT'S FAR. WHICH SO THEREFORE SB FOUR TWENTY TWO COMES ALONG WITH A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE OF AN EMPLOYEE REGISTRY. WOULD ENSURE THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM TO SUPPLY MORE RELIABLE HEALTHCARE AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST STATE EMPLOYEES IN CONTRAST TO PRIVATE CONTRACTORS ALREADY KNOW THEIR PATIENTS. AND THE INSTITUTIONS THEY WORK AND THEY WOULD PROVIDE BETTER CONTINUITY AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND 35% OF THEIR BASE SALARY DR PAN SAID THERE'S NO BENEFITS. IT'S JUST A PREMIUM SORRY AND THAT'S BETTER THAN THE CONTRACTORS OBVIOUS COST SAVINGS THE PROPOSED REGISTRY WILL BE MODELED AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL L. A. COUNTY REGISTRY. OF THOSE REGISTRY PROFESSIONALS AND THEIR PATIENTS ARE HAPPY AT THE COUNTY OF L. A. HAS SAVED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SB FOUR TWENTY TWO IS A- OR TWENTY TWO ZERO. CARACOL THE SAME RESULTS FOR THE STATE. I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT UP IN SOCCER CAMP. MY NAME IS DR KIM THANK YOU CHAIR AND SENATE COMMITTEE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. I LIKE THIS BILL I SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE THIS IS IN COOL SO I SPENT THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND IT TOOK ME THOSE MANY YEARS TO GET UP MY LAST TWELVE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO DESIGN HEALTH CARE PLANS. SO I'M A DESIGNER OF HEALTH CARE PLANS AN INDUSTRY EXPERT AT LEAST I THINK SO. YOU HAVE TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE DOCTORS AND PSYCHIATRISTS AND ALL IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD SO EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS GENERALLY WORKED THERE SIXTY HOURS A WEEK AS REGULAR DOCTORS THE WORK ANOTHER EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY HOURS A WEEK IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE OF NAY THEY CAN MAKE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. OF THEIR PAY. WITH THE EBB AND FLOW OF EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES. AND MANY OF THOSE DOCTORS ENGAGE IN BEING HIGH LEVEL GUNSHOT WOUND SPECIALISTS. SO IF WE'RE ONLY GOING A 135% HERE. CROSS THE BORDER HOLD MAN I'M THERE TRUST ME CENTERED AROUND THERE ON THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE A MAJOR SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS BECAUSE MANY OF AMER BABY BOOMERS LIKE ME THEY'RE PULLING UP THE PLUG AND REMOVING THE IDAHO. SO IF I WAS WRITING THIS BILL I WOULD BE GONE FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT. JUST SO YOU KNOW. ANYWAY GREAT BILL I SUPPORTED. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SIR THE MOTION. WELL YEAH. THANK YOU. ZERO SIR I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS A LITTLE BETTER- CURRENTLY THE CONTRACT OUT IN A COST THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS IF THEY HAD JUST HIRED BACK ONE OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE. WHY ON EARTH WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT. BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF A BUDGET. I FEEL LIKE I'M MISSING PART OF THE PICTURE IF YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE BUDGET. AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT. NOT SPEND THIS AND SPEND ONLY THIS. THEN YOU WOULD DO THAT. SO THERE'S GOTTA BE A REASON THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT. IT IS IT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH- PHYSICIANS TO HIRE BACK. BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY REASON IF THERE'S NOBODY AVAILABLE THEN THEY THEY HAVE TO DO THAT AND THIS BILL DOES NOT PRECLUDE THEM FROM CONTRACTING OUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POSITION TO DO IT CORRECTLY. EXACTLY SO. I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION- SO THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE THE ONES WHAT WE'RE- FOR SOME REASON- THEY HAVE NOT BEEN. IS INTERESTED IN CREATING A REGISTRY WHICH THEN WOULD CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY LOOK YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE YOUR OWN DOCTORS WHO ARE WILLING TO. DO SOME EXTRA TIME RIGHT AND ACTUALLY HAD A LOWER RATE THAN YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU ARE SPENDING NOT JUST HAVE TO SPEND THAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING. FOR CONTRACTING CONTRACTED OUT DOCTORS SO TO US- TO THE SPONSOR TONIGHT THIS JUST MAKES A LOT OF SENSE IT SAVES MONEY. THE DOCTORS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY NOTICES CELANESE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU JUST BRING IN A HIRED GUN HIS LIKE- WHERE'S THE STUFF AND WHERE HOW TO PLAY FILED YOU KNOW IT'S EVERYWHERE TO THINGS. AND SO NOW I'VE THANK YOU FOR THAT OKAY WELL THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.

MEMBERS LAUREL LAST AUTUMN PLEASE. DR BEN THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR COOPER AND MEMBERS AND CREATE THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION SO SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES ANOTHER COST SAVING BILL ACTUALLY AND FROM MY DISTRICT IT'S ALLOWS. EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS AT SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT DISTRICT RIGHT HERE- TO MOVE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES. TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD CURRENTLY THE DISTRICT AND SIMPLY ORGANIZATIONS MUST GO THROUGH THE OVER BURDENED AND UNDER RESOURCE SUPERIOR COURT SYSTEM FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION. THIS EXISTING PROCESS IS TIME CONSUMING MORE EXPENSIVE AND ACTUALLY MAY PLACE AN UNFAIR PRACTICE CHARGE WITH THE JUDGE WHO HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH. A PUBLIC EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS MEETING AGAIN EVEN MORE TIME WHEN THAT HAPPENS. IN COMPARISON THE PROCONSUL RESOLUTION PROCESS IS STREAMLINED LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS AND TAXPAYERS AND SPECIFIC THE CONFLICT RESOLUTION WITHIN PUBLIC SECTORS I SHOULD POINT OUT. THAT THIS IS SUPPORTED BY BOTH THE EMPLOYER SECOND REGIONAL TRANSIT AND THAT THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION SO ALL THE PARTIES WANT THIS BUT THAT EXPECT WE ASK WHEN I BUT TO MOVE THE BILL. OKAY WILL OF THE- NEXT REMOVE A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE'VE GOT TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES- FIRST OF HIS DAVID PHILLIPS.

AND- WHICH PROVIDES JURISDICTIONS FOR MOST OF OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION. THIS CURRENT SO THAT THERE IS AN ALLEGATION OF YOUR P. VIOLATIONS. WERE REQUIRED TO FILE A WRITTEN SUPERIOR COURT. THE WAY THE PROCESS IT CAN TAKE MONTHS TO YEARS TO BE GOOD JUDGMENT YEAH THIS COULD BE FROM A JUDGE. THAT MAY NOT HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE THE LABOR LAW. THIS IS ALSO A PART OF THE PROCESS THE TAXPAYERS ARE THE ONES THAT END UP HAVING TO PICK UP THE TAB FOR THESE. BOB THIS BILL CHANGES THAT BY PLACING SAKHAR T. UP WORKERS UNDER PREPARE STATION. COST EFFECTIVE THAT AT THE TIME WE WAITED SOLVE THEM FULLY EMPLOYEE RELATIONS. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT BOTH EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEGINNING FACE. IT LIMITS INTERFERENCE WITH THE POLIO ORGANIZATIONAL RIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME BUT ALSO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES FROM BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. FOR THE LACK OF FAIR REPRESENTATION BY THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY BELONG TO YOU- BUT AGAIN- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME NO I HOPE WE GET A YES VOTE ON THIS ONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
