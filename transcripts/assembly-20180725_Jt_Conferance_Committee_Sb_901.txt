GOOD MORNING I SHOULD SAY. THE AFTERNOON WILL BE HERE MOMENTARILY -- I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYBODY HERE TO THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON S. B.. NINE OH ONE I REALLY APPRECIATE MY SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY FOR TAKING. TIME ON THIS VERY VERY CRITICAL WORK. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE HERE. OR WHO ARE TURN IT TUNING IN AND PUBLIC REVIEW IN INPUT. IS A SATCHEL IN THE PUBLIC PROCESS. BEFORE WE KICK OFF THIS FIRST HEARING. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME IS CO CHAIR THEY CLEARLY EXPLAIN MY GOALS TODAY. AND OVER THE NEXT MONTH. THESE GOALS ARE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD FIRST AND FOREMOST. YOU FIGHT FOR THOSE DEVASTATE IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES. TO PREVENT FUTURE WILDFIRES FROM CLAIMING [inaudible] NEW VICTIMS [inaudible] SECOND PREVENTING RATEPAYERS AND TAXPAYERS FROM BEARING UNDUE COST. WE'VE SEEN UNPRECEDENTED WILDFIRES ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE IN RECENT YEARS. MY COMMUNITY WAS DEEPLY IMPACTED BY THESE WILDFIRES LAST YEAR AND I'VE ALREADY HAD NINETY THOUSAND ACRES. BURN IN MY DISTRICT ALONE THIS YEAR. WE CAN'T GO BACK IN TIME AND CHANGE THE PAST TRAGEDIES. BUT WE CANNOT FORGET ABOUT THE VICTIMS. AS A STATE WE MUST SUPPORT THEM WEREN'T FROM THE STAKES IN THE PAST. IT ENSURED THAT WE WORK TO PREVENT FUTURE WILDFIRES. IN IMPLEMENTED BEST PRACTICES GOING FORWARD. IN ELKS OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE. WE NO DOWN POWER LINES OF BECAUSE MANY OF THE DEVASTATING FIRES IN THE PAST. HELLFIRE IS COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS IT JUST SIXTEEN OF LAST YEAR'S FIRES IN ITS FOR ELEVEN CASES. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S BECAUSE THEY FOUND EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS MAINLY DEALING WITH TREE CLEARANCES. FRANKLY PGM A VIOLATED OUR TRUST INVEST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. CLEARLY THE UTILITIES IN THE CPUC NEED TO BE FORCED TO STEP UP. IT SURE THEY'RE MEETING OUR SAFETY NEEDS. BEFORE DISASTER STRIKES. IT'S ALSO ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE AND IT CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN. IF THE LEGISLATURE FAILS TO ACT. AVOIDABLE FIRES WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. THIS IS NOT ABOUT SPECIAL INTEREST. THEY'RE NOT OUR CONCERN RIGHT NOW. AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT COMMUNITIES. VICTIMS AND RATEPAYERS PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE. AND ULTIMATELY. WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM. I BEEN ON A MISSION OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY PREVENTION AND MITIGATION ALL YOUR LONG. THE LAST FIRE SEASON UNDERSCORED THE NEED TO THINK INNOVATIVELY AND PRO ACTIVELY. WE CAN ALL AGREE THE BUSINESS AS USUAL IN A WORD [inaudible] IS UNACCEPTABLE. IT WE ALL AGREE THAT WE SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB OF MANAGING OUR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. SO POWER LINES DON'T START HUGE FIRES. THAT WOULD INCLUDE STRENGTHENING FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VEGETATION REMOVAL. IF FOR STRUCTURE MAINTENANCE UTILITY COMPANY INSPECTIONS INTEMPERATE SHUT OFF OF POWER. DURING EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. MORE EXPANSIVE A DETAILED WILDFIRE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANTS. AND THAT MEANS BETTER UTILITY PLANNING A GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO OPERATE THE GRID. INCLUDING CHECKING COMPLIANCE. BEFORE A FIRE. THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THE CPUC HAS DONE QUITE POORLY REGULATED UTILITIES IN ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT WE ALL KNOW. THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET FOR PREVENTING. SUCH DEVASTATING WILDFIRES WE NEED TO TAKE A THOUGHTFUL HOLISTIC APPROACH. THIS IS GOING TO BE AN OPEN TRANSPARENT AND DELIBERATIVE PROCESS. TODAY WE ARE STARTING WITH AN OVERVIEW. AND WILL EXPLORE MORE ISSUES IN DEPTH AND SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS. AS A COMMITTEE WE WILL BE TARGETED OUR SCOPE. BUT LET ME MAKE THIS STATEMENT. THIS IS NOT A CHRISTMAS TREE TO ADD ON RELATED ISSUES. WORKING TOGETHER BUILDING UPON OUR WORK OVER THE LAST YEAR I TRULY BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE REAL PROGRESS THAT WILL MAKE OUR STATE. A SAFER PLACE. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR BEING HERE TODAY I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO THE CO CHAIR OF THIS. COMMITTEE CHRIS HOLDEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS HOLDEN. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD AND I JOIN WITH YOU AND YOUR ASSOCIATE WITH YOUR COMMENTS. OF OUR PURPOSE HERE IN THESE CLOSING WEEKS. SESSION IS TO BRING TO FRUITION MONTHS. OF RESEARCH AND DISCUSSION AND HEARINGS CONCERNING WILDFIRES. WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND YOU LOOK UTILITY IMPACTS. AS WE HAVE SEEN THE GROWING CHANGE IN OUR WEATHER PATTERNS AND A RESULTING RESULTING GROWING THREAT OF CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN OUR STATE. WE MUST CHANGE HOW WE THINK ABOUT AND MANAGE THAT THREAT. THAT STARTS WITH ENSURING A SAFE AND RELIABLE ELECTRIC GRID. WE MUST PREVENT THE FIRES THAT FROM OCCURRING. TO THE DEGREE POSSIBLE AND THAT THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES HAVE A CLEAR AND HIGH STANDARD OF CARE TO ENSURE PREVENTION AND SAFETY. WHEN THESE TRAGEDIES DO OCCUR? UTILITIES MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF THEY DO NOT MEET THAT STANDARD. BUT WE ALSO NEED OUR ELECTRIC UTILITIES. THERE ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR DAILY EXISTENCE AND OUR ECONOMY. THEREFORE WE MUST CONSIDER WAYS THAT THE UTILITIES CAN MANAGE THE COSTS WITHOUT DISRUPTING SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. OR TRIGGERING EXCESSIVE REPAIR IMPACTS. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOVERNOR BROWN'S LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE. I'M PLEASED TO ASSIST THE SEE THAT HE IS FULLY ENGAGED IN THIS IMPORTANT TIMELY ISSUE. WE WILL REVIEW AND CONSIDER HIS SUGGESTIONS AS PART OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM. AND AS SUCH I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR AGREEING TO SERVE. AND TAKING THEIR TIME TO BE A PART OF HELPING TO CRAFT WHAT WE THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT -- CONCLUSION TO SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES. THANK YOU CENTER GREAT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER [inaudible] FIRST. BEFORE OFFER ANY STATEMENT REGARDING THE ROLE OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE COMPLEX ISSUES THAT WE MUST FACE. I'D LIKE TO START WITH CONVEYING MY HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES. IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE POLICY AND IN THE BATTLE OVER THE POLITICS I DON'T WANT US TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE DEVASTATING. OF THE DEVASTATION FACED BY COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE WILDFIRES. DEVASTATION THAT IS DISPLACED THE LIVES OF ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. ERASED DREAMS AND MEMORIES AND THAT IS ULTIMATELY COST LIVES. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED WE OWE IT TO THEM TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS READY TO DEAL WITH THE GROWING. FIRE DEBT DANGER. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND THE GRATITUDE OF THIS COMMITTEE TO THE FIRST RESPONDERS. FIRST RESPONDERS WHO OF BATTLED OF THESE FIRES ARE CURRENTLY SUPPRESSING FIRES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. WORKING THE FIRE LINES MAYBE YOUR PROFESSION. BUT WE ARE AND ALL OF YOUR BRAVERY AND SACRIFICE AND THAT OF YOUR FAMILY'S WHILE YOU ARE IN HARM'S WAY. WE KNOW THAT THE DESTRUCTIVENESS OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA IS INCREASING DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS. INCLUDING MULTI YEAR DROUGHT THE AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS CLEAR THAT. IT IS A CLEAR THREAT THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR ARE MEASURES THAT CAN TAKE CAN AND MUST BE TAKEN TO REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES. ADDITIONALLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FOUND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WILD FIRES WE'VE ALREADY SUFFERED. MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT 50% OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMES FACE. SEVERE WILDFIRE RISKS. NO ONE IS INSULATED FROM THIS DANGER. THE RESULTING DESTRUCTION COSTS COST ALL OF US. INCREASED RATES OF INSURANCE PREMIUMS UTILITY CHARGES AND COST AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. LAST YEAR THE COST TO CALIFORNIA ALONE WAS OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THE POINT IS THAT WE ALL PAY IN SOME FORM. THERE IS THIS IS NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM. WE MUST USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DANGER THE RISKS AND OUR POLICY OPTIONS. THE NIGHT THE DANGER MAY BE INCREASED BUT WE SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THESE RESULTS AS THE NEW NORMAL. AS THE HOOVER INSTITUTION STATED IN A POLICY BRIEF ON CALIFORNIA'S FIRE DANGER. AND I QUOTE. DEVASTATING FIRES ARE NOTHING NEW IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY AND FROM EVERYTHING WE KNOW THEY WILL REMAIN A CONSTANT FORCE. HOWEVER A FUTURE FILLED WITH MORE AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES. EACH OUTDOING THE LAST IS NOT INEVITABLE. THE STATE CAN MAKE CHOICES NO THERE WILL HELP KEEP IT SAFE FOR IN THE FUTURE. WE'VE BEEN TASKED WITH REVIEWING EVIDENCE HEARING TESTIMONY AND WEIGHING THE INTEREST OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS OF PROPOSALS. THERE WILL BE. IN THE FINAL CONFERENCE REPORT. TODAY'S HEARING IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION STATE THE FACTS AND FRAME THE ISSUES. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON AN ISSUE THAT REQUIRES EXTRAORDINARY ATTENTION AND A COMMITMENT TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THOSE MOST AFFECTED. AND TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE RISK AND DANGER A FUTURE WILDFIRES. SO THERE HUESO. I JUST SIMPLY WANTED TO CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MISTER. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN. OF AND AND CONCUR WITH THE COMMON SORT OF MADE BUT SIMPLY TO STATE. THAT OF I BELIEVE. THAT. THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO REALLY STEP UP AND MAKE. SOME POLICY CHANGES SETTING CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS. THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING OUR STATE IS UNDERGOING. AN ENORMOUS CHANGE. I MEAN IF IF PEOPLE. NOW I BE NOT ONE THING I HAVEN'T HEARD IS THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS HAVE BEEN VERY QUIET LATELY. AND ONE THING IS VERY OBVIOUS -- EVEN EVEN THE ANIMALS ARE MIGRATING NORTH. SENDING US A MESSAGE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING WITHOUT A CHANGE OUR POLICY. TO ADDRESS THAT. AND AND IT SADDENS ME TO SEE. YOU KNOW AS WE SPEAK NOW. FIRES APPROACH YOSEMITE. THEIR FIRES BURNING CURRENTLY IN OUR STATE CAUSING ENORMOUS HARM. AND IN ITS ANNUAL COUNTY THERE BEEN JUST DEVASTATING FIRES JUST LIKE IN ANY OTHER COUNTY. BUT IT'S AN EAGLE COUNTY WE HAVE TAKEN. ALREADY SOME -- ENORMOUS MEASURES -- TO PREVENT. AND UNLESS IN THOSE FIRES AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE IN SAN DIEGO. AND ENSURE SERVES AS A MODEL OF WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE STATE. THEIR POLICIES AND SAN DIEGO THAT APPLY ONLY TO SAN DIEGO. AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BECAUSE FIRES ARE AFFECTED EVERY PART OF THE STATE NOW AND START FIRST WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT HOW. THAT'S WORKING FOR US IN HOW CAN HELP THE RISK STATES THANK YOU TAKE SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY. THANK YOU -- CHAIRS ALSO WANTED JUST TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY THINK THE GOVERNOR THE PROTIV IN THE SPEAKER. OF FOR CALLING THIS HEARING IS SO THAT WE CAN. A PROCESS THAT I THINK THE VICTIMS DESERVE I THINK THAT THE THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT TOM. YOU KNOW WHO'S LIABLE IT THERE IS LIABILITY OUT THAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF A BUT I WANT TO SHARE THAT -- FOR THE SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FIRES AND YOU KNOW REPRESENTING A FORCED TO DISTRICT AND OUR WATERSHEDS -- YOU KNOW WE PUT OURSELVES IN THIS POSITION -- WE'VE GOT A HUNDRED YEARS ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE SUPPRESSED WILDFIRE AND ALLOW THE VEGETATION -- TO GROW AND WITHOUT ADDRESSING THINNING ARE FORCED ALLOWING FIRE TO DO IT WAS NORMALLY SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH WAS THEN THE FOREST -- THAT'S GOTTA BE PARTICIPATION THAT WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVE MOVING FORWARD ON HOW WE MANAGE OUR FOREST. ADDED A PATIENTS GO WHERE WE CAN MAKE IT SAFER FIRE TO BE BACK INTO OUR ECOSYSTEM SO -- I APPLAUD THIS COMMITTEE FOR COME TOGETHER I APPLAUD THE SPEAKER THE GOVERNOR THE PROTIUM UP USES NECESSARY THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PIECES. OF THIS WON'T BE EASY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED. TO LAY OUT A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE HAD. FIVE OF THE STATE'S LARGEST FIRES AND THEY'RE NOT -- MANY DISTRICTS ARE AND THAT WE HAVE A VEGETATION AND FUEL LOADING PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. ALONG WITH A MANAGING OUR GRID IN A WAY THAT TIME MINIMIZES -- WILDFIRE SO AGAIN I THINK THIS COMMITTEE I'M LOOKING FORWARD. TO AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT -- MEETINGS WHERE WE ACTUALLY HEAR FROM ALL SIDES IN THAT WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT'S THE BETH PASSED FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHAT. THINKCENTRE DOT AND I ONE THING ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY FOR THOSE COMMENTS WE'VE BEEN PREACHING THE SAME MESSAGE FOR YEARS NOW AT I REMEMBER. DISTINCTLY THE LAST NIGHT OF SESSION TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HE SPOKE ABOUT THIS ON THE FLOOR AND THE VERY NEXT DAY A MAJOR FIRE BROKE OUT IN LATE COUNTY. AND HERE WE ARE THREE YEARS LATER WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL NOT CLOSER TO RESOLVING SOME THESE CRITICAL CRITICAL ISSUE SO I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR COMMENTS AND AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT. LIKE SENATOR DIED -- MY DISTRICT WAS DEVASTATED BY THE FIRES -- PEOPLE DIED. THAT HASN'T COME UP YET. FORTY FOUR PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THESE FIRES. THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES LOST THEIR HOMES EVERYTHING THEY OWNED IN ONE NIGHT. TODAY MIGHT MANY OF THOSE FAMILIES A LOT OF THIS CANCERS ARE LIVING WITH FRIENDS SUMMER STILL LIVING IN MOTELS. SUMMER LIVING IN RENTALS THAT HAVE SKYROCKETING COST ALBEIT WALLPAPER BY INSURANCE MOST OF THEM. GOOD TAKE AS MANY YEARS TO REBUILD THE HOMES THE BUSINESSES THAT WERE LOST AND IN THE END MY COMMUNITY WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. THESE PEOPLE ARE MY PRIORITY. HOW TO PREVENT AND PAY FOR WILDFIRES IS DOMINATED MY MY MY THOUGHTS EVERYDAY SINCE OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR? IT'S A COMPLICATED EMOTIONAL PROBLEM HOUSE OF THESE FOLKS BE MADE WHOLE. HOUSE WE BETTER MANAGE OUR FOR SOME WILD LANDS IN THIS NEW NORMAL. WHICH THE NEW WE SHOULD JUST TAKE IT OFF QUIZ THAT ENOUGH TIMES PASS I DON'T THINK IT'S NEW ANYMORE -- AND HOW CAN WE ENSURE THE VITALITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. A MEAGER TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SAFE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND A FAIR SYSTEM TO HOLD RESPONSIBLE PARTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FOR THEIR FOR THE DAMAGES. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR. I WILL VIEW EACH PROPOSAL FIRST AND FOREMOST DO THE LANDS. OF HOW IT WILL IMPACT THE SURVIVORS. NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT BUT EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHO HAS SUFFERED THE TRAGEDY OF THESE FIRES. AND WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR THE FAMILIES AND BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE TRYING TO BUILD THEIR REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND REBUILD THEIR LIVES. I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME THIS PAST YEAR THINKING AND TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME GOOD SOLUTIONS OUT THERE I'M I'M EXCITED TO WORK ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND I HOPE WE CAN COMEUP WITH SOME OF THOSE AND PUT THOSE INTO MOTION. BUT IF OVER STRONGLY THERE WAS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE MISSING. AND I'M CONCERNED WITHOUT KNOWING THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE TUBS FIRE. THE CONVERSATION MAY BE PREMATURE. I'M WAITING FOR THAT REPORT. HOW CAN WE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION WE DON'T HAVE THE BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS THE MOST EXPENSIVE FIRE IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THE REPORT ON THAT? I WANNA THANK THE CHAIRS IN THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING. THROUGH THE RECESS TO GET UNDERWAY HERE ON THANK THE PANELISTS FOR COMING TODAY AND I LOOK FOR TODAY'S CONVERSATION. SO HER STOMACH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES OF FIRST OF ALL -- LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANDRA DINO LIKE. TO THANK OUR FIRST RESPONDERS -- THAT HAVE DONE A YEOMAN'S JOB OF OF PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AND AND TRYING TO SAVE STRUCTURES AND PREVENT ME FOR THE LOSS OF LIFE THAN THE FORTY FOUR OF VICTIMS OF WE SAW HERE IN. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND INTO THE INTO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES -- WE COME TOGETHER HERE TODAY TO TRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT THE FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER BUT TO ENSURE THAT WE DO THE BEST WE CAN -- TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND IS OUR NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY AND I WANNA THANK -- ARE PRO TEM -- ATKINS -- FOR HAVING THE CONFIDENCE IN CHOOSING ME AND MY MY DEAR FRIEND US SENATOR CANNELLA. TO WORK WITH THIS VERY ESTEEMED BODY -- TO COME UP SOME BLISS WAS SOLUTIONS AND THAT AND FIGURE -- A LOT OF VARIABLES OUT THAT REGIS. DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT. I LIKE TO TRANSPARENCY THE COMMITTEE. BUT I JUST WANT TO MENTION A FEW THINGS AND I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO OUGHT TO FOCUS ON DURING OUR OUR DELIBERATIONS -- I CAME INTO THROUGH LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO GET TO THE STATE SENATE THAT WORKED -- AT THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE AND WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE THE VAST FOREST THAT YOU HAVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- THE WE DO HAVE THE THE IDYLLWILD AREA MOUNT SAINT ACENTO SO WE DO HAVE SOME FORESTED AREAS AND I QUICKLY LEARNED WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE IMPORTANT OF THE CALIFORNIA HERE TAX. BASE THAT WE HAD IN OUR LOCALITY. THE SUPERVISOR THAT I DEFEATED WANTED TO MOVE THAT YOUR TAX BASE FROM HAMMER RYAN AIRPORT WHICH WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES TO MARCH AIR FORCE BASE. WHICH MEANT THAT THE CAL FIRE AIR APPARATUS I WOULD HAVE TO OF GONE WITH THE FEDERAL FLIGHT PLANS TO GET TO THEIR DESTINATION WHICH MEANT IT COULD BE FORTY FIVE MINUTE DELAY. TO GET TO A FIRE IN OUR FIRE CHIEF OF MANY YEARS WHO WAS WITH HELLFIRE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS CHIEF HAWKINS EXPLAINED TO ME HASN'T. A YOUNG A SUPERVISOR THAT YOU WANT TO PREVENT THESE FIRES IN GOING BEYOND TWENTY ACRES OF THE WISE YOU NOW HAVE A WILDFIRE THAT COULD BE MUCH MORE MORE MORE DEVASTATING. SO I HOPE THAT WE ALSO THAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT WHERE WE HAVE OUR STRATEGIC AIR BASES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND DO WE HAVE AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TIMES TO THE MOST VULNERABLE. AREAS A OF THE STATE. AND THEN CERTAINLY IT YOU KNOW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- AS WE LOOK AT PLANNING APPLICATIONS SO I THINK WE NEED TO FURTHER SCRUTINIZE NOW WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO BUILD AN EXTREMELY FIRE PRONE AREAS AND AND AND START TALKING ABOUT AYE KNOW THE BUILDING INDUSTRY TO SOMEONE HERE ABOUT OTHER MANDATES BUT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW EXTERNAL SPRINKLERS ATION IN THESE AREAS ARE RICH EVEN DIFFICULT TO FIND. OF FIRE INSURANCE. I NOTHING TO WE NEED TO DO IS WE HAVE TO GET PAST SOME OF THE EXTREME POLICIES OF THE STATE WHEN IT COMES. TO THINNING OUR FORESTS THAT HAVE DEAD TREES I MEAN WE HAVE THE G. S. O. B. GOLD SUPPORTERS THE GOLD SPOTTED. ARE OPEN BORE IN OUR COUNTY THAT WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF DEAD TREES AND YET. WE CANNOT GET IN THERE TO REMOVE THEM AND THE FIRE HAZARDS -- THAT THEY THE THEY CREATE -- ALSO IF WE AS WERE ASSESSING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS FIRE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND IN MANY WAYS IT'S GOING TO BE. EXTREMELY IMPACTFUL -- TO ARE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN BE IMPACTFUL TO POTENTIALLY -- UTILITIES AND WE NEED TO HAVE A AN EMERGENCY FIRE RESERVE FUND THAT IS SOMEWHAT SUSTAINING SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE A DEVASTATING YEAR WHICH WE HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TOO MANY OF THESE THAT WE HAVE. THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING AND RESERVE READY TO GO TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE CAN DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REBUILD AND AND RESTORE THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT. OUR CITIZENS OF HAD TWO INDOOR WHAT THE LOST OF THEIR HOMES OTHER POSSESSIONS. AND AND I HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE GOD THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS A CLIMATE CHANGE WHETHER% WE SEE CLIMATE CHANGE AS A RESULT OF MANMADE CAUSES OR WHETHER IT'S JUST A CYCLE CHANGE IN THE ENVIRONMENT I THINK THAT THERE'S NO -- NO ARGUMENT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ODD GOING ON YET -- THE INSURANCE -- REGULATIONS OF THE STATE FOR BED. OUR OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR A CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THAT AND THEN LASTLY ó WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT. ALL OF OUR UTILITIES THAT HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT GOES IN AND THROUGH -- AREAS WHICH ARE EXTREMELY FIRE PRONE. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THE APPROPRIATE MEDICATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS APPROPRIATE WE TO PAYMENT AND AROUND THEIR LINES WITHIN A RADIUS OF THAT. LINE COMING DOWN AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE LINES HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH THAT IF THERE. ARE BLOWN DOWN THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SPARK AND CONTINUE A FIRE THAT EXISTING OR BECOME THE NIDUS OF AND IV. OF A FIRE IN BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR STANDARDS FOR FOR MITIGATING -- THESE BUT I APPRECIATE US SERVING WITH ALL OF YOU LOOK FORWARD TO COMING UP WITH SOME GOOD SOLUTIONS NOT ONLY. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES IN THE BEST WAY -- TO SOLVE THOSE ISSUES BUT TO PROSPECTIVELY COME UP WITH POLICIES AND POTENTIALLY LAWS THAT ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC -- FROM THE LOSS OF LIFE THAT WE CERTAINLY SEE AND THE LOSS OF PROPERTY -- AND THE IN THE DANGER MEANT OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY LIES CENTER THERE EVERYDAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE PROTECTED. THANK YOU SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE YOU HAVE A STATEMENT FROM -- SENATOR JACKSON. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF THE STATEMENT FROM SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON READS AS FOLLOWS THANK YOU SENATOR DOG IN SOME REMEMBER HOLDEN FOR ORGANIZING TODAY'S HEARING. I REGRET THAT I AM UNABLE TO JOIN BUT IS A CHAIR THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT THE SUBSTANCE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO ME. THE JOINT COMMITTEE IS HAVE HELD AT NO LESS THAN SIX HEARINGS ON WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE LAST OCTOBER'S. DEVASTATING NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES. OUR COURAGE MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS COMMITTEE TO REVIEW TESTIMONY FROM THOSE HEARINGS AS THEY CONSIDER PROPOSALS DISCUSSED TODAY. FOR ME THIS IS CENTER JACKSON. THIS ISSUE IS PERSONAL. EVERY EMBER OF LAST WINTER'S THOMAS FIRE THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY BURNED IN MY DISTRICT. FOR FORTY DAYS FIREFIGHTERS CAME FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND INTERNATIONALLY TO HELP US BATTLE A BLAZE THAT ULTIMATELY BURNED. OVER TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRES DESTROYED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND BUILDINGS AND CLAIMED TWO LIVES. AND HARDLY A MONTH FROM THE START THE FIRE UNPRECEDENTED REIGNS IN THE HILLS ABOVE MODESTY THOUGH UNLEASHED A FIRE CAUSED DEBRIS FLOW. THAT UP IN THE TREES SWEPT AWAY CARS LEVELED HOMES BURIED. HIGHWAY ONE A ONE UNDER TWELVE FEET OF MUD AND KILLED TWENTY THREE OF MY NEIGHBORS. THE PEOPLE OF SET SENATOR JACKSON'S DISTRICT CONTINUE TO LIVE WITH THIS DISASTER FOR EIGHT MONTHS NOW AND EVERY DAY FACE THE PROSPECT OF NEW FIRES ERUPTING IN THE DROUGHT PARCHED LANDSCAPE OF THE CENTRAL COAST. SENATOR JACKSON CONTINUES WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO GET AHEAD OF THESE INCIDENTS AND HELP OUR LANDSCAPES BECOME MORE RESILIENT. WHILE ALSO DOING ALL WE CAN TO STOP WILD FIRES FROM BREAKING OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE. OUR GOAL MUST BE AN ACQUITTAL UNEQUIVOCAL AND OUR STRATEGY CLEAR WE NEED TO REDUCE WILD FIRES IN CALIFORNIA. SO FOR EVERY PROPOSAL WE CONSIDER IN THIS COMMITTEE WE SHOULD ASK WILL THIS POLICY REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD AND SIZE OF WILDFLOWERS. WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA IF THE ANSWER IS NO THEN WE NEED TO KEEP SEARCHING. SENATOR JACKSON ENDS BY SAYING THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ORGANIZING TODAY'S HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO JOINING IN PERSON FOR FUTURE HEARINGS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO AT THIS TIME -- WE'RE GONNA. HAVE OUR FIRST -- SPEAKER PANEL BOB ARE UTILITIES A CLIMATE CHANGE MICHAEL JUARA. IS A RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE STATE'S DIRE TAYLOR CENTER FOR ENERGY POLICY IN FINANCE. THE STANFORD WOODS INSTITUTE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT [inaudible] WHAT UP? I DO WANT -- EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA PUBLIC A COMMENT AT THE END OF ALL THE PANELS. ONE COMMENT I PERIOD ALTHOUGH MEMBERS. OBVIOUSLY WILL BE ALLOWED TO ASK QUESTIONS AND HAVE DISCUSSION ON THESE IMPORTANT TOPICS THANK YOU [inaudible] THAT'S IF A MIKE THERE ABOUT NOW. THERE WE GO MUCH BETTER. SENATOR DODD ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO COME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY -- I AM GONNA TALK ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. I VIEW WILDFIRES. AS A SPECIES OF CATASTROPHIC RISK. TO HURRICANES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES FOR FLOOD RISK IN MANY PLACES FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM. WE CONFRONT AS A STATE AND YOU CONFRONT AS A COMMITTEE IS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM FOR ALLOCATING IN MANAGING THE RISK OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. IS UNSUSTAINABLE. FOR MULTIPLE REASONS. ONE IS THAT. THE SITUATION IS UNSAFE AS I HEARD YOU ELOQUENTLY SPEAK ABOUT THIS MORNING. TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED [inaudible] AND HURT. AND THEIR LIVES DESTROYED BY WILDFIRES IN THE STATE. PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT PART A RISK THAT IS THAT ALL SIDES OF THE PROBLEM ARE NOT BEING WORKED EFFECTIVELY. SUMMER BEING WORKED LESS THAN THEY SHOULD. SOME ARE NOT EVEN ADDRESSED IN ADDITION [inaudible] IMPORTANTLY. WILDFIRES AFFECT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THEIR IMPACTS ON THE FINANCES OF EVERYONE CALIFORNIA EITHER AS IN ELECTRICITY CUSTOMER. OR AS A TAXPAYER. RATE PAYER IMPACTS IF IT TURNS OUT THAT RATEPAYERS ARE ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE FIRE THAT WE KNOW THE LEAST ABOUT TUBBS FIRE [inaudible] COULD BE. ANYWHERE -- FROM TWENTY TO FORTY DOLLARS PER MONTH. FOR EVERYONE IN THE P. G. SERVICE TERRITORY. WE DON'T KNOW WITH THE OUTCOMES IN THE THERE BUT THAT RISK IS THERE FOR TUBS AND FOR A FUTURE FIRED THAT MIGHT OCCUR IF P. JEANNIE. BEHAVES PRUDENTLY WHICH HOPEFULLY THEY DO -- FINALLY. BECAUSE OF THE THREATS TO THE FINANCES OF THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES [inaudible] WILDFIRE. FUNDAMENTALLY THREATENS THE CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS OF THE STATE. UTILITY RISKS WILL WILL AND ALREADY ARE INCREASING THE EXPECTATION FOR RETURN ON EQUITY OF THE FOLKS THAT OWN P. JEANNIE SHARES. THAT'S GONNA RAISE THE COST FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU AND MANY OF THE MEMBERS -- WOULD LIKE TO ACCOMPLISH OVER THE NEXT DECADE. POTENTIALLY TO LEVELS THAT RULE OUT. ACHIEVING THE CLIMATE TARGETS -- AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BEAR IN MIND THAT ALL OF THIS IS CONNECTED. AND IT MANAGING THIS RISK AFFECTIVELY. SHRINKING THE RISK IS GONNA HELP. MAKE OTHER GOALS ACHIEVABLE. A SOLUTION TO WILDFIRE RISK IT'S AN ADDRESS ALL THE DIMENSIONS OF THE RISK WILDFIRE RISK IS NOT JUST A UTILITY ISSUE I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS NOT EVEN MOSTLY A UTILITY ISSUE. THERE ISSUES AROUND A POLICY SOLUTIONS GONNA REQUIRE THINKING ABOUT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LIABILITY. THAT ALREADY IS EXIT EXISTING. FOLKS NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE PUT BACK IN THEIR HOUSES AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. THEY'RE IMPORTANT ISSUES AROUND INVERSE CONDEMNATION UTILITY WILDFIRE PLANNING ACCOUNTABILITY AND ULTIMATELY COST RECOVERY. HOMEOWNERS PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE THERE'S A BREWING. INSURANCE CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THIS RISK AND THE LACK OF MANAGEMENT THAT'S OCCURRING WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. A HARD PROBLEM. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE CONTROLLED BURNS ARE IMPORTANT. BUT WHERE THE VALUE AT RISK AND THE LIVES AT RISK ARE MOST CONCENTRATED CONTROLLED BURNS ARE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOMPLISH OTHER SOLUTIONS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE DIVERSITY OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IN THE SMALL PARCELS ARE GONNA BE REQUIRED. LAND USE PLANNING AS WAS MENTIONED IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND BUILDING CODES ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER BUILDINGS. CURRENT FIRE SAFE BUILDING CODES APPLY ONLY TO BUILDINGS THAT ARE NEW SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OR SUBSTANTIALLY REBUILT SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO. EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IT'S GONNA APPORTION THE RISK TO THOSE WHO CAN MANAGE IT MOST EFFICIENTLY AND THAT MEANS CARVING UP. RIGHT NOW AT LEAST FOR UTILITY COSTS WILDFIRES. MOST OF THE RISK RESTS WITH UTILITY RATE PAYERS BY INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND EXPENSES ALLOWED IN RATES IF THE UTILITY WAS PRUDENT. OR WITH UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS BY INVERSE CONDEMNATION OR THE AND DISALLOWANCE IF THE UTILITY WAS NOT PRUDENT [inaudible] SIGNIFICANTLY HOMEOWNERS AND THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T BEAR A LOT OF THAT RISK BECAUSE THEY CAN SUBJUGATE AGAINST THE UTILITY. WE SHOULD BE ASKING WHETHER THAT IS APPROPRIATE NOT BECAUSE SOMEONE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT PAY. BUT BECAUSE ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM NEED TO BE WORKED DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS IMPORTANT. INSURANCE AND THE INCENTIVES THAT CREATES ARE SOME OF THE STRONGEST. METHODS FOR GETTING TO THE PARCEL LEVEL AND HELPING PEOPLE. TO MOBY MOTIVATED AND CONCERNED WITH CREATING THAT SPACE. BUT I THINK THE FIRST STEP IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE TO KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS ONE IS EXISTING LIABILITIES AND THE OTHER IS TO GO FORWARD PROBLEM THE FUTURE LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE CREATED AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT. TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING LIABILITIES FIRST IN MY VIEW BOTH BECAUSE THEY ARE REAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED AND OUR VICTIMS AND NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE. AND BECAUSE IT SIMPLIFIES. POLITICAL THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ADDRESSING THE GO FORWARD PROBLEM WHICH IS IN FACT I THINK CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES -- ONE PROPOSAL FOR THE EARLIER THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND POTENTIALLY EARLIER LIABILITY IS SECURITIZATION AND WE'VE SEEN AB THIRTY THREE INTRODUCED OR AMENDED BY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK -- I THINK IT'S A PROMISING PROPOSAL THAT HAS A NUMBER OF KEY ON ANSWER QUESTIONS ONE IS. WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT SECURITIZED HOW MUCH OUR RATEPAYERS GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM LEVEL THAT'S A BLANK SPOT IN THE BILL. ANOTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION IS THE PROCESS FOR CREDITING RATE PAYERS IF UTILITIES AT FAULT. AND SOME GUIDANCE FROM THE COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE ON THE PROCESS IF A DISALLOWANCE DOES NEED TO OCCUR. THE GO FORWARD RISK FROM WILDFIRES IS A MUCH MORE COMPLEX ISSUE. AND HERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SET EXPECTATIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM. NEEDS TO START THINKING ABOUT BUT MAY BE MORE COMPLEX THAN IS FEASIBLE TO ADDRESS IN A MONTH ONE POTENTIAL SOLUTION. POR PART OF A SOLUTION I WOULD I'M GONNA EXPLAIN WHY MEAN BY THAT IS IN VERSE COMBINATION REFORM. FROM MY VIEW IF THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THAT THE BEST OPTION IS TO MOVE AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES FROM STRICT LIABILITY TO A REASONABLE STANDARD. FOR ALL ELECTRIC UTILITIES BOTH PUBLIC AND INVEST AROUND. LIM DOT CHANGE TO WILDFIRES. AND INSURE THAT THE UTILITIES ARE STILL LIABLE IF THEY'RE NEGLIGENT WHICH THEY SHOULD BE. AS THEY A AND NOT THAT RECREATES IN CALIFORNIA THE NATIONAL STANDARD. FOR TO WHICH UTILITIES ARE HELD. MY VIEW IS THAT IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL I'M HAPPY EXPLAINING QUESTIONS ON WHY I THINK THAT. THE KEY ISSUE THOUGH. THE ONE NOT ADDRESSED SO FAR IS THAT OUT OF THAT MOVE ALLOCATES RISK FROM UTILITIES. TO HOMEOWNERS AND THEIR INSURERS -- ANOTHER PIECE OF THE STATE'S POTENTIAL SOLUTION IS UTILITY BETTER UTILITY WHILE ARE PLANNING A COST RECOVERY. WE HAVE TO REQUIRE UTILITIES TO TAKE INNOVATIVE STEPS TO REDUCE RISKS IN THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. TO SOME DEGREE THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING VIA THE CPC PROCESS AND AND FAST ACTION AT THE COMMISSION. ARE S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT OR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH IS MY I THINK IN SOME WAYS MODELED ON TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL IF ENACTED CREATE A SORT OF CENTRALIZED PROCESS FOR DOING THIS. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT OTHER MODELS FOR MANAGING RISK IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND AT THE ENTERPRISE LEVEL. AND TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT I THINK OUR SARBANES OXLEY. THE KILLER SECTION THREE OF TO IN SECTION FOUR A FOR WHICH REQUIRE CEO AND GENERAL COUNSEL LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RISK MANAGEMENT. AND THE NUCLEAR AND OIL INDUSTY WHERE COMPLEX SYSTEMS. SAFETY IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS IS A CORE MISSION. AND WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF LEARNING THAT HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES THAT WE COULD BENEFIT FROM AND THE UTILITIES COULD -- A THIRD PIECE OF A POTENTIAL SOLUTION AND ONE THAT WILL BECOME ESSENTIAL IN MY VIEW. IF INVERSE CONDEMNATION REFORM WERE TO OCCUR IS REFORM OF PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS. WE WOULD NEED IS A STATE TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO REDUCE THE EXIT OF MAJOR INSURERS FROM THE HOMEOWNERS MARKET. IF WE SHIFT SIGNIFICANT WILDFIRE RISK TOWARD HOMEOWNERS INSURERS THAT IS A PROBLEM THAT IS ALREADY HAPPENING ALREADY BREWING WHERE I LIVE. MANY OF THE LARGE INSURERS DO NOT WRITE NEW POLICIES THAT IS TRUE ACROSS LARGE FRACTIONS OF THE STATE AT THIS POINT. NONE OF THOSE INSURERS ARE CANCELING POLICIES ARE REFUSING TO RENEW. BUT IF WE WERE TO SHIFT A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF LIABILITY IN THEIR DIRECTION GIVEN PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE AND THEIR INABILITY TO PRICE THE RISK. THAT IS A FEASIBLE OUTCOME IF YOU LIMIT PRICE THE RESPONSE OF THE MARKET IS TO LIMIT SUPPLY WE'RESEEING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RIGHT NOW WE CAN SEE MUCH MORE IF IF THE STATE ISN'T CAREFUL. TOM I THINK A LOT OF THINKING NEEDS TO GO ON HERE THAT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE WITH VERY DIFFERENT POLITICS IN THE ENERGY SYSTEM. AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THAT I VIEW THIS LIABILITY REFORM ISSUE IS MORE COMPLEX THAN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LIABILITY. AND THE AND TO SOME DEGREE ARE CLARIFICATION OF THE COST RECOVERY PROCESS -- ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THIS IS MY TOWN. ON A BAD DAY IN. NINETEEN TWENTY NINE BUT PRINT THAT WE HOPE NEVER OCCURS AGAIN FOR FIRE. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT NOT JUST IN A CONTROL BURKE CONTEXT BUT WHERE PEOPLE LIVE. CURRENT NON UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DISPROPORTIONATE ON PUBLIC LANDS AND SPARSELY POPULATED AREAS THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE IF WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE RISK -- I HAVE A NUMBER OF AYE THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT -- BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE PROBABLY IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. AND THAT CARROTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE AND STATE -- WELL I JUST SAID THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN MANY VERY FINE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. IS LARGELY NONEXISTENT. THIS A PICTURE SAUSALITO ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE STATE FARM INSURANCE THAT'S NOT RIGHT NEW POLICIES AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. VERY HIGH VALUE REAL ESTATE. NO DEFENSIBLE SPACE LOT OF OLD STRUCTURES WITH SHINGLE SIDING. THAT IS A TINDERBOX WITH MANY LIVES AT RISK DENSELY POPULATED URBAN COMMUNITY. COULD BE JUST LIKE COFFEE PARK ON A BAD DAY -- WE NEED INSPECTION EDUCATION FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. AND POTENTIALLY ASSISTANCE TO HOMEOWNERS TO HELP THEM CUT DOWN TREES THAT THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE A HARD TIME AFFORDING TO HELP PAY FOR THAT BARBAROUS WORK IT'S GONNA KEEP THE COMMUNITY SAFE -- FINALLY AND MAYBE THIS IS THE HARDEST ISSUE [inaudible] ARE. LANCE LIMITING LAND USE EXPANSION INTO THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE BECAUSE OF THE RISKS BECAUSE OF THE COSTS CURRENTLY SOCIETY IS SOCIALIZING OF COSTS. EITHER IN RATES OR IN -- OR VIA TAXPAYER FUNDING OF FIREFIGHTER RESPONSE COSTS AND SOUND CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT DICTATES RETREAT FROM SOME OF THESE AREAS. AND AT A MINIMUM IMPOSING SOME OF THE COSTS ON THOSE AREAS THAT THEY CREATE. THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT POLITICAL PROBLEM WE'VE SEEN. EXAMPLES OF IT PLAY OUT IN THE FLOOD INSURANCE CONTACTS OR HAVEN'T MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS OTHER STATES HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO WINDS DAMAGES AND WIND INSURANCE I WOULD RECOMMEND THE COMMITTEE LOOK AT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE THERE A LOT OF SURPRISINGLY PROGRESSIVE POLICIES COMING OUT OF VERY CONSERVATIVE STATES TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. AND I THINK IT'S ANOTHER THIS IS ANOTHER. VERSION OF THAT. WE HAVE PUT PEOPLE IN HARM'S WAY VIA A WHOLE SLEW OF POLICIES THAT WERE WELL INTENDED OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS. AND WE NEED TO HELP THEM STAY OUT OF HARMS WAY BUT ALSO NOT MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE -- SO THERE'S A WHOLE SET OF THINGS UC A COMPLEX MENU. I THINK WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULLY ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM I HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE CAN MAKE A VERY GOOD START PERHAPS ACCOMPLISH SOME OF THE EARLY ISSUES THAT THE SIMPLER PROBLEMS NOW. AND MAYBE GET A VERY SIGNIFICANT SUBSTANTIVE BEGINNING AND START TO THE CONVERSATION ON THE HARDER ONES -- I JUST IF I SAID TO THEIR TWO SETS OF ISSUES ONCE TRACTABLE PERHAPS IN A MONTH. ANOTHER MAY. TAKE MORE TIME. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE SURGICAL BUT IT'S A STRETCH GOAL. TO RESOLVE THE LIABILITY QUESTION IN MY VIEW. AND I WOULD ALSO JUST EMPHASIZE ONE THING ARE. THAT THAT THAT IN CONCLUDING. THERE TO HAVE POLITICAL CONCLUSIONS THAT I'VE HEARD. IN THIS CONVERSATION FROM THE ELECTRICITY CRISIS AND I THINK THEY'RE BOTH WORTH BEARING IN MIND ONE IS DON'T LET UTILITIES GO BANKRUPT. AND WE'VE HEARD THAT THE CEO A P. GENIE HAS MENTIONED BANKRUPTCY ON AN EARNINGS CALL SHAREHOLDERS THAT'S AN UNUSUAL THING FOR CEO TO SAY. OUR TO HURT SHAREHOLDERS -- THE OTHER THOUGH IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT BEWARE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF COMPLEX CHANGES HASTILY MADE. RIGHT BEFORE THERE WAS A UTILITY BANKRUPTCY THERE WAS. RESTRUCTURING OF ELECTRICITY SYSTEM IN A MANNER THAT. TURNED OUT TO BE UNWISE AND DIDN'T FULLY TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CHANGES BEING UNDERTAKE. BOTH APPLY HERE. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO HELP TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE AND TO DO THE WORK THAT WE CAN DO THIS YEAR TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE AND TO MAKE THEM WHOLE. AND BUT ALSO TO BEAR IN MIND THAT SOLVING A PROBLEM IN THE ELECTRIC UTILITY SYSTEM BY CREATING ONE SOMEWHERE ELSE MAY NOT SERVE ANYONE'S INTERESTS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH I I'VE I'VE GOT ONE QUESTION THAT I I YOU TALK ABOUT THAT THE CONCEPT OF SECURITIZED INVESTOR OBLIGATIONS -- YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT. SECURITIZED AIMED AT AS AND A B. THIRTY THREE I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING IS IS. CAN YOU SECURE TIES [inaudible] THE INVESTOR. PORTION OF IT. IF IT WAS A HIGH BRED WHICH IS SAY OF AB. THIRTY THREE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THAT THAT WE FELT WAS NECESSARY. TO TO STAY WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. AND SOME PORTION WITH THE RATEPAYERS I'M WONDERING WHAT THE MECHANISM. COULD POSSIBLY BE TO SECURITIZED. TO HELP THE INVESTOR SO IT DOESN'T [inaudible] AT YELLOW. PERHAPS TAKEN INTO BANKRUPTCY IF THAT'S THE WORRY AFTER WE I HAVE THIS THIS DAY IS CONCLUDED WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE THIS AS FAR AS A PROCESS IN THAT REGARD. WELL I THINK I THINK THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD IS A REASONABLE ONE IT'S A ONE THAT IT'S ONE THAT HAS A TRACK RECORD THAT DATES BACK TO THE ELECTRICITY CRISIS WE ALL PAY ARGUE W. ARE BOND CHARGE ON OUR ELECTRICITY BILL -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE -- AND IN MY VIEW STE SECURITIZATION WAS TRADITION REALLY DOES IS SPREAD THE COSTS OUT OVER TIME. TO THE DEGREE THAT IT'S PROBLEMATIC WHAT'S PROBLEMATIC ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU'RE IMPOSING COSTS. THAT ARE CREATED BY CURRENT RATE PAYERS AND THE UTILITY TO CURRENT UTILITY ON FUTURE RATE PAYERS WHO MAYBE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO CAUSE THIS PROBLEM OR CREATE THIS PROBLEM. I THINK THAT. SECURITIZATION WOULD DO MUCH TO CALM SOME OF THE MARKETING IS IT THAT APPEARS TO EXIST AROUND THE CALIFORNIA INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND YOU SEE THAT IN THE STATEMENTS OF THE RATING AGENCIES [inaudible] ALSO THE THE PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AND AND ANALYST REPORTS FROM FROM THE FOLKS THAT OWN. OUR UTILITIES -- IT WOULD IT WOULD GIVE SOME CONFIDENCE THAT. THE UTILITIES -- THEY TILDE CONCERNS ARE TAKEN SERIOUS AT IN THIS FACT THIS COMMITTEE EVEN EXISTS GIVES SOME CONFERENCE ON TO THAT -- THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS IT'S A ONE OFF SOLUTION. RIGHT IT MAKES PEOPLE HOLE IT WOULD MEAN THAT. P. JEANNIE COULD SETTLE -- PERHAPS SOME OF THEIR LAWSUITS AND AND AND AND PAVE THE UNDERINSURED AND UNINSURED LIABILITIES FASTER RIGHT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES PARTY PAID. OR ARE PAYING MUCH OF THE INSURED LOS -- I'M LESS CONCERNED THAT THEY GET THEIR MONEY QUICKLY -- I THINK WE SHOULD BE LESS CONCERNED -- BUT THE THE BIG QUESTION AROUND I THINK THE BIG QUESTION AROUND THIS IS HOW THE CREDITING. RIGHT SO IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT IF THE FIRM SECURITIZED IS THE RISK -- AND IT TURNS OUT [inaudible] THAT. TABS OR OR ANOTHER YOU KNOW OR TALK HIGHWAYS THOMAS ISN'T IN THIS BECAUSE IT'S I ONLY CAN TURN SPEAKING AT THIS POINT. BUT IF THE TUBS FIRE WERE -- ATTRIBUTABLE -- TO P. GENIES IMPRUDENCE -- HOW WOULD THAT CREDITING TAKE PLACE OVER WHAT TIME FRAME WOULD RATE PAYERS BECOME UNSEATED WOULD BE OVER THE EXTENDED TIME FRAME THAT WOULD TEND TO GIVE? THE OWNERS OF THE COMPANY -- THE BENEFIT OF THAT TIME VALUE OF MONEY -- AND WOOD HELP TO CALM THEM IN TERMS OF THIS SORT OF PERCEIVED CRISIS. IT WOULD ALSO POTENTIALLY BENEFIT RATEPAYERS IN TERMS OF RETURN ON EQUITY -- THAT THAT THAT THERE WILL BE ACOSTA CAPITAL PROCEEDING EVENTUALLY FOR ALL OF THE UTILITIES AND IF THEY ARE EXPOSED TO THIS RISK FULY. THERE'S LIKELY TO BE A MUCH HIGHER COST OF CAPITAL MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN THERE IS NOW BUT THE KEY ISSUE THERE IS CLARIFICATION ON HOW HOW TO PAY BACK WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS WERE ALLOWED. PRIOR TO A FINDING APPROVED FIVE FINDING IT PRETTY FIVE PRIOR TO CONCLUSION OUT THE FULL CPUC PROCESS. THAT WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR. I GUESS THE I GUESS THE QUESTION AND AND IT MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER NOW WE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND THIS OUT. YOU AT SOME POINT TIME YEAH IT'S EITHER CREDIT BACK PAYERS OR SIMPLY. THE UTILITY PAINT THAT SHARE. YES OF THE SECURITIZATION YES EITHER ONE WOULD BE FEASIBLE YEAH [inaudible] THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH REPRESENTATION NIGHT OF A COUPLE QUESTIONS YOU KIND OF HIT ON A COUPLE THINGS THAT. THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT YOU MENTION EXIT OF INSURANCE SIR INSURERS FROM THE MARKET -- AND ENDING HE SAID WE NEED I THINK YOU SAID WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO STEM THE TIDE OF THAT OR MAYBE I MISSED THAT'S HOW I INTERPRETED IT -- AND YOU TALK ABOUT BROADER INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS -- DO YOU HAVE MORE THOUGHTS ON THAT I MEAN. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT CAME OUT OF THE FIRE THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRES. AIMED AT SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT I'LL BE HONEST YOU KNOW INS IN SUMMER CASES I KNOW. ABOUT 60% OF THE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT WHO HAD LOSSES OR UNDER INSURED. AND IN MANY CASES INSURERS ARE NOT WILLING TO WRITE UP POLICY FOR THE FULL VALUE. OF OF THE PROPERTY SO THEY WILL BE CONTINUE TO BE CHRONICALLY UNDER. AND THAT'S A CHALLENGING EVEN EFFORTS DO YOU ALLOW PEOPLE TO BUY EXCESS COVERAGE -- BEYOND WHAT THEIR POLICY HAVE BEEN MET WITH SOME RESISTANCE SO YOU HAVE. AS YOU AS WE START TALKING ABOUT THIS. AND AND THE SCOPE OF OF THE ISSUES HERE IN THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I JUST SEE. I SEE [inaudible] TEN BILLS COMING OUT OF OUT OF THIS LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF SOBS SUBJECTS BEYOND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE TODAY SO I WAS A BROAD QUESTION BUT DO YOU. YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT YOU COULD YOU MENTIONED YOU MENTIONED PROP ONE OF THREE AND THAT'S IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE DISCOVERED I DON'T THINK THAT PROP ONE OF THREE IS GOING TO CHANGE ANYTIME SOON. AND ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS ON THE INSURANCE SIDE HAS TO BE CONSISTENT FURTHER ITS PURPOSES. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE JUDGE MADE. LAW ON THE ISSUE -- SO THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE. INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HOMEOWNERS AT THE MOST AFFORDABLE PRICE THAT REFLECTS THE RISK THEY'RE TAKING RIGHT AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE AT LEAST IN THE VIEW OF THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGE INSURERS. THE PRICES THEY CAN CHARGE DO NOT REFLECT AT RISK. AND SO AND THAT'S PARTLY A FUNCTION OF PROP ONE OF THREE IT'S PARTLY FUNCTION OF RIGHT OF DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. IT'S IT'S A COMPLEX IT'S PARTLY A FUNCTION OF PUSH BACK FROM PEOPLE WHO RECENTLY YOU KNOW DON'T ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR BILLS AND FOR THEIR MORTGAGE. AND THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS A BIGGER INSURANCE BILL -- I THINK. THERE A NUMBER OF ASPECTS OF THE INSURANCE ON INSURANCE SIDE THAT COULD BE CHANGED BUT THE POLITICS OF INSURANCE ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE POLITICS OF ENERGY WHICH IS WHAT I'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH. SO I'M I WANT TO BE A LITTLE BIT HUMBLE HERE AND REFLECT THAT REFLECT THAT KIND. IGNORANCE -- BUT I THINK ONE OBVIOUS QUESTION TO ASK IS. WHY IT IS WHY IT IS THAT INSURERS CANNOT REINSURER? THEIR WILDFIRE RISK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IS A WELL USED TOOL FOR MANAGING CATASTROPHIC RISK IN OTHER STATES AND WE SHOULD BE ASKING. WHETHER THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE STEP TO TAKE THAT WOULD HELP THE INSURERS TO SPREAD OUT THEIR RISK HELP THEM TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE MORE. OF THE RISK IN CALIFORNIA -- ANOTHER QUESTION TO BE ASKING IS WHETHER WE WANT TO MOVE TOWARD THE APPROACH THAT THE SOUTHEASTERN U. S. IS TAKEN WHERE THERE ARE SEPARATE STATE RUN PROGRAMS THAT MANAGE A PARTICULAR SLICE OF THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE RISK. THIS IS THE WIND INSURANCE AND THE SOUTHEAST IT COULD WELL BE THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT FOR WILD FIRE INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD NOTS SING I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THAT THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THAT. I THINK THE LEARNING SINCE THAT TIME IT'S BEEN DONE IN THE SOUTHEAST ON WINS SUGGESTS A DIFFERENT MODEL THAT IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE -- AND I THINK THAT -- THERE HAS TO BE SOMEWAY IT'S WAS INTERESTING SO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET FIRE INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA KICKING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE BECAUSE OF FIRE. AND UP ON SOMETHING CALLED THE FAIR PLAN [inaudible] AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON THE FAIR PLAN. THAT -- THEY CAN BE CHARGED DIFFERENTIAL RATES DEPENDING ON THEIR RISK RATHER THEY HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE OR NOT. THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES. THE SAME THING IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE FOR THE REGULATED LINES. AND I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO START TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO EDUCATE HOMEOWNERS ABOUT WHAT THE RISKS ARE. MOST PEOPLE WHERE I LIVE DON'T HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE IT. NO ONE TELLS THEM. NO ONE SAYS TO THEM YOU COULD SAVE MONEY. IF YOU CUT DOWN THAT TREE. AND I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION IS A STATE THAT MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR SOME BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE TRIP. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. BUT IT ALSO IS RISKY AND INCREASINGLY RISKY AND THE CLIMATE WE LIVE. COM AND YOU TALKED INTO. JUST ANOTHER YOU TALK ABOUT PROTECTION ESPECIALLY IN THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE AND AND WE'RE NOT DOING AS MUCH OF THE GOOD IN YOU AND YOU JUST HIT ON THAT I THINK. I THINK SOMETIMES HOMEOWNERS DON'T KNOW THAT THE TREES ARE RISK AND THEN THERE I KNOW THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE HOMEOWNERS. MAY KNOW THERE'S A TO TREAT SERVICE THEY DON'T WANT THEM CUT DOWN BECAUSE FOR FOR OTHER REASONS -- I THINK THAT THAT AND THAT CONTINUES TO JUST THE FUEL LOADS IN THOSE AREAS CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM. AND WE KNOW WE'RE STARTING TO NO OTHER WERE WAITING FOR SOME ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS ON THIS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THESE HUGE FIRES ALL THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS. EFFORTS THAT WE'VE DONE FOR REDUCTION -- GO OUT THE WINDOW BY HUGE FACTORS AND THAT AIR QUALITY IS PRETTY AWFUL BUT QUITE FRANKLY AFTER HAVING LIVED THROUGH THAT. THE DAY AFTER OUT THE TUBS FIRE INBREEDING THAT FOR THREE OR FOUR WEEKS -- SO. IT YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON IT BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET GRANDSON MEAN CERTAINLY IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS WE CAN'T GET GRANTS -- FOR SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THINGS ARE SCORED -- THROUGH -- THROUGH ITS WE CAN'T GET ACCESS TO SOME OF THE FUNNY TO DO SOMETHING THE DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON ON HOW THAT MIGHT HAVE THAT MIGHT PLAY OUT GOING FORWARD. WELL I MEAN I SEE JUSTIN MY SLIDES THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF THE FUEL REDUCTION GRANTS IN THE STATE AND THAT THAT IS AN EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE ACTION. IN MY VIEW THOSE GRANTS ANY INCREASE IN FUNDING SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON WHERE PEOPLE LIVE. RIGHT DIRECTLY ON RISK REDUCTION KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE. THAT COULD BE A COST SHARE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER WHERE THEY HAVE A TREE THAT'S AT RISK. RIGHT IT'S BUDGET THAT CREATES RISKY BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S GONNA COST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO CUT DOWN. YOU KNOW THAT THAT MAY BE A COST SHARE FOR THE COMMUNITY. IT COULD BE FULLY FUNDING POSITIONS FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY -- ON THE IN THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND EDUCATE HOMEOWNERS ABOUT WHAT HOW THEY'RE CREATING RISKS. NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THEIR NEIGHBORS -- AND I THINK THE YOU KNOW THAT THE LAST IN AND HARDER QUESTION IS IS THIS ISSUE AROUND YOU DEVELOPMENT. AND AND AND THE FOOTPRINT OF NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE VERY HIGH HAZARD AREAS. AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THORNY DEVELOPMENT LAND USE IS A LOCAL. ISSUE ALONE AND ISSUE A REALLY LOCAL CONTROL. BY. WE'RE CREATING THAT LOCAL DECISION MAKING IS CREATING SIGNIFICANT EXTERNALITIES FOR THE STATE. IN TERMS OF THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM AND ALSO TAXPAYERS AND SO AT SOME POINT. QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ASKED IN MY VIEW. THANK YOU A CENTER CANNELLA. FIGURES CHAIRMAN SO IN YOUR SLIDES I WANT TO THANK YOU MENTION IS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHERE PEOPLE LIVE YOU SAID WE CAN EXPAND IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF MY QUESTION? OTHER THAN COSTS WERE SO THE IMPEDIMENTS TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT [inaudible] SEE -- ALL THE ALSO TO THAT I THINK ARE SIGNIFICANT. ONE IS THAT IN MANY COMMUNITIES -- YOU ACTUALLY NEED A PERMIT TO CUT DOWN TREES THAT ARE BIG. FROM WHOM FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE YOU NEED HERITAGE TREE PERMITS I THINK THAT THE STATE. SHOULD LOOK AT THAT ISSUE AND CONSIDER WHETHER -- IF A HERITAGE TREE IS LOCATED WITHIN THE ZONE ONE AS CAL FIRE I THINK LIKES TO CALL IT RIGHT THAT FIRST THIRTY FEET. FOUR HUNDRED FEET WEATHER PERMITS SHOULD BE REQUIRED IF HOMEOWNER ONE THIRTY FEET OR HER FEET FROM THEIR HOUSE STRUCTURE THAT YASSER -- AND THE YOU KNOW ANOTHER ANOTHER BEER IN THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT -- BUTI THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE TO BE THINKING ABOUT. IS THE ISSUE OF UTILITY. TREE TRIMMING AND ARBORISTS IN IS DENSELY POPULATED AREAS WITH LOTS OF SMALL PARCELS CURRENTLY. DE UTILITY CODE THE SAFETY CODE SAYS THAT UTILITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR CUTTING DOWN DEAD DYING EXECUTIVE TREES OUTSIDE OF THE UTILITY EASEMENT. RIGHT IF THEY COULD FALL INTO THE LINES THAT'S WHAT HAS CAUSED ALL THE FIRES FOR WHICH WE HAVE BY REPORTS SO FAR THIS FROM THE PAST YEAR. TREES OUTSIDE OF THAT TEN FOOT ZONE THAT'S CLEAR GETTING BLOWN INTO THE ZONE AND KNOCKING DOWN INFRASTRUCTURE CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT SO. THAT YOU'RE SAYING TREATING HOUSES OR TREES THING Y. TREE SITTING TREATING LINES OKAY SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT THAT REQUIREMENT AND TEN FEET FROM SO HOW FAR TO THE TREES OF BE CLEARED FROM THE ACTUAL LINES. THERE HAS TO BE TEN CLIP CLEARANCE. BEYOND AND PARDON ME I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPERTS SITTING BEHIND ME WHO KNOW THIS MUCH BETTER THAN I DO UNLESS THEM AS WELL BUT TEN FOOT CLEARANCE AND THEN IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY ARBORIST. TO CLEAR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THAT EASEMENT THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THE EASEMENT AND CAUSE A FIRE THE CHALLENGES. IN PLACES WITH THOUSANDS OF LANDOWNERS YOU GOT TRESPASS ISSUE. AND MY QUESTION IS HOW CAN NOT HOW CAN WE SERVE RESOLVE THAT TRESPASS PROBLEM. MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE ARBORIST GOING TO SOMEONE'S BACKYARD IN SAUSALITO AND CUT DOWN A TREE THAT'S A RISK IT'S DEAD OR DYING WITH DOUBTS -- AND AND AND MAKING OUT EASIER THIS BOTH GOING TO REDUCE RISK AND ALSO CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY GREATER CAO BECAUSE THE CODE ALSO EXEMPTS THE UTILITIES IF THEY HAVE TO TRESPASS. TO GET A TREE SO HOW DID YOU SEE THAT THE FIRES WERE CARS BECAUSE LARGELY BY. TREES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY THAT FILLED THESE LINES ARE WITH THESE OUT YOU KNOW I CAN'T I CAN'T LOOK AT IT I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID SO THERE ARE SAID CENTER WE'RE GONNA BE HAVE. I UNDERSTAND BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT TO CLARIFY WHAT HE SETS OKAY I CAN'T. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES THANK YOU. WHEN YOU NEED NOTED YOUR SOLUTIONS THE FIRST SLIDE ON SOLUTIONS HAVE TO DO WITH INVERSE CONDEMNATION? AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL ACTION. THAT A BIG PROBLEM WILL WORD TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION. A WHAT SPECIFICALLY DID YOU MEAN BY. CONSTITUTIONAL ACTION IN WHAT I'M SORRY THAT WAS -- UNCLEAR -- WHAT I MEANT BY THAT IS THAT IT WOULD BE CONSTITUTIONAL? FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS A LAW WHICH CLARIFIES -- CLARIFIES -- THE MEANING OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION -- AND THAT THAT ACTION IN MY VIEW. WOULD BE UPHELD NOT REALLY IF BUT WHEN IT WAS JUDICIALLY CHALLENGED BY THE COURTS AND THE KEY CASES THERE. THERE'S A CASE CALLED -- METHODIST HOSPITAL OF SACRAMENTO VERSUS SAILOR. WHICH IS KIND OF THE THE THAT DID MOST KEY CASON THAT DID LOOK WITH THE SUPREME COURT LOOKED AT ISSUE OF CLARIFICATIONS INTERPRETATIONS OF AMBIGUOUS PROVISIONS. IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LEVEL OF DEFERENCE THE COURTS WILL GIVE TO LEGISLATIVE INTERPRETATION OF AMBIGUOUS PROVISIONS AND THE COURT SAID IT IS NOT JUST THAT THEY THEY IN GENERAL WILL DIFFER IN THE SUPREME COURT'S YOU IT'S THEIR DUTY TO DIFFER. UNLESS THE PROVISION IS CLEAR -- AND AND IT LEGISLATURE IS TAKING ACTION THAT'S CLEARLY -- CONTRADICTORY TO THE CONSTITUTION NOW GIVEN THE CASE LAW ON INVERSE CONDEMNATION EARLY CASES ALBERS. AND THE FLOOD INSURANCE CASES -- LACHLAN AND ITS PROGENY -- I THINK THERE'S A CASE TO BE MADE A VERY GOOD CASE THAT A NARROWLY TAILORED INVERSE CONDEMNATION REFORM. IS CONSTITUTIONAL WOULD WOULD PASSED JUDICIAL MONSTER AND JUDICIAL REVIEW -- ABROAD EXEMPTION. IS A DIFFERENT STORY ALTOGETHER. RIGHT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT. FLOOD CASES OR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL [inaudible] ARE THEY'RE RELATIVELY NARROW. LIMITED TO A CERTAIN SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK -- A BILL THAT. LOOKS AT THAT ISSUE AND AND EVALUATES THE FACTORS AND THERE CAP APPLIES THEM TO THE FACTS WE CONFRONT NOW -- HAS THAT HAS A VERY GOOD CHANCE I'M OUT I WANT TO SAY IT'S A CERTAINTY BECAUSE NOTHING IS CERTAIN WHEN YOU. GOT BEEN IN LITIGATION -- GOT TO SUPREME COURT BUT I THINK IT HAS A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF SURVIVING YOU SHORTLY. TIM A MEMBER WOULD. THINK THANK YOU MISTER I JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP AND THAT WAS IT CO JOG MY THOUGHT PROCESS HERE. YOU KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT -- ART WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW WE COULD DO SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL GRANTS FOR FOR AWHILE AND ENTER THE URBAN INTERFACE -- AREAS AND IN MAKING AREA SAY ARE THERE EXAMPLES WERE OTHER JURISDICTION YOU TO AND YOU TALK BUT CARROTS AND STICKS SO THERE ANY EXAMPLES OUT THERE WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. IN THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT WE COULD. RATHER THAN REINVENTING THE WHEEL -- FIGURE OUT HOW. BEACON. IT'S I AGREE I I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING BUT ARE THERE IS THERE SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE. TO TELL I THINK YOU KNOW I I DON'T MEAN TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE IN THIS ONE BUT THAT THE WINDS PROGRAMS AND SOUTHEAST ARE GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS WHERE. THE KNOW THAT THE REFORMS THE INSURANCE REFORMS WERE PAIRED WITH BUILDING CODE AND LAND USE REFORM. THAT WAS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE EQUATION. AND THE INSURANCE REFORMS CREATE STRONG INCENTIVES FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO TAKE LESS RISK AND A BUILDING CODES AND THE LAND USE REFORMS HELP -- TO AVOID THE CREATION OF NEW. VALUE AT RISK [inaudible] AND SO -- YOU KNOW IT'S THAT COMBINATION. THAT ACTION THAT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT. THAT CHALLENGE IT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR REAL ESTATE MARKET WE HAVE FAR MORE VALUE AT RISK DUE TO WILDFIRE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. IN THE COUNTRY. THE DATA I'VE SEEN SUGGESTS THAT YOU KNOW ORGAN WASHINGTON ARE RIGHT BEHIND US BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE VALUE RISK IS LOWER BY A FACTOR OF FIVE AND SO. WE'RE IN A SOMEWHAT UNIQUE SITUATION -- AND WE HAVE TO WORK WE HAVE TO LEARN FROM ANALOGOUS PROGRAMS AND ALSO DO SOME. CREATIVE THINKING EXPERIMENTATION -- THE ONE OTHER PIECE TO THIS THAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT. THE BEST APPROACH IS ONE THAT CREATES PROCESS OF LEARNING. AND RE EVALUATION AND ITERATION RATHER THAN SPECIFYING ANSWER. RIGHT SO. IN THIS IS TRUE. ON THE PRIVATE LANDOWNER SIDE IT'S ALSO TRUE IN THE UTILITY SPACES WE THINK ABOUT WILDFIRE PLANNING FOR UTILITIES WHAT WE WANT UTILITIES TO DO. IS TO BE OPEN ABOUT WHERE THEIR SYSTEM FOR PLANNING IS WORKING AND WHERE IT IS NOT. AND NOT TO FEEL PRESSURE TO SAY EVERYTHING'S FINE. ALL GOOD HERE SO THAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE COST RECOVERY AND THAT'S A REAL TENSION RIGHT IT'S ATTENTION BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE GOING TO WANT. TO BE CERTIFIED AS COMPLIANT WITH WHATEVER PLAN [inaudible] APPROVED. PART OF THAT PLANNING PROCESS NEEDS TO BE SOME ADMISSION OF WHERE THINGS NEED WORK. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND LEARN [inaudible] SURE HOLD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANTED TO SORT PICK UP IN THE AREA OF THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND MORE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF OTHER STATES AND HOW. IT APPLIES SIMILARLY TO CALIFORNIA'S AND AND AND WHAT'S DIFFERENT HISTORICALLY AND HOW THEY GOT TO WHERE. THEY'RE APPLYING. OF THIS DOCTRINE IN THE SAME WAY. VERSUS HOW WE MAY BE DOING IT OR WHAT THE SIMULATORS MAY BE. SO OTHER THAN ALABAMA. CALIFORNIA AS AS FAR AS OUR RESEARCH HAS BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE INVERSE CONDEMNATION HAS BEEN APPLIED TO PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT HAVE THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN. THAT BEING SAID IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED LAW IN CALIFORNIA THAT. BECAUSE THESE PRIVATE ENTITIES DO HAVE THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN. THAT THEY SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO SOME FORM. BOB INVERSE CONDEMNATION LIABILITY. THE COURTS THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HAVE CREATED SOME NUANCE IN THE DOCTRINE -- WHERE? ESPECIALLY IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE LIABILITY MIGHT BE SO CRUSHING LIKE THE RISKS CREATED MIGHT BE SO DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. THAT IT WOULD TO TURF PROVISION OF THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. RIGHT SO THERE'S A BALANCE THAT HAS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED THERE WHERE -- ON THE ONE SIDE IS IS THE NEED TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS. FROM PAYING HAVING BEING FORCED TO PAY UNFAIRLY FOR THE PROVISION OF SOME PUBLIC BENEFIT BECAUSE THE HOUSE BURNS DOWN OR ITS UNDERWATER BECAUSE A LEVEE BREAKS -- ON THE OTHER SIDE IS THE VERY STRONG DESIRE OF THE STATE TO SEE THAT THESE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE PROVIDED RIGHT AND WE'VE. WE HAVE VERY STRONG PROTECTIONS FOR ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS THAT IN TERMS OF THE UTILITIES OBLIGATION TO SERVE THAT WERE REINFORCED DURING ELECTRICITY CRISIS [inaudible] AND AND SO UTILITIES ARE OBLIGATED TO SERVE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THEY DO SO AT A PRICE THAT'S AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE -- AND NOTS WHERE ANY OF THERE'S A QUESTION AND IT'S ONE FOR THE A COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER -- WHETHER YOU KNOW WHETHER THE RIGHT BALANCE IS BEING STRUCK. AND I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT I THINK IT'S A VERY POLITICALLY SENSITIVE QUESTION DISABLED LEAST -- BUT IT THERE IS CERTAINLY FLEXIBILITY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. IN OTHER STATES THESE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD. WHEN AND WILD FIRES OCCUR? RIGHT SO THEY IF THEY ARE NEGLIGENT IN MAINTENANCE OF THEIR SYSTEMS AND A WILDFIRE RESULTS [inaudible] THEY'VE HAD. IF THEY HAVE EXERCISED A REASONABLE DUTY OF CARE. THEY ARE NOT LIABLE -- AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND LOOK AT YOU KNOW SORT OF WILD FIRES AND UTILITIES WOULD YOU MOSTLY SEE IS THE DISASTER RESPONSE ISSUES. AND CONSIDERATION BY COMMISSIONS OF HOW THEY STAND THE WOULD POLLS UP AGAIN WHEN THEY'RE BEEN BURNT TO THE GROUND. NOT SO MUCH THE ISSUE OF HOW THE UTILITIES WOULD PAY. FOR THE DAMAGES THAT MIGHT ENSUE FROM A DOWNED Y. [inaudible] THANK YOU -- YES [inaudible] PLEASE. SO YOU ARE A LITTLE VAGUE YOU SAID OTHER STATES OVER WE AN OUT LIAR OR IS THERE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THE DEFINITION OF VERNE INVERSE CON MISSION ARE ARE USE INVERSE COMMISSION SAME WAY EXTENDED CALIFORNIA DOES. WHAT MANY STATES APPLIED THE SAME LAW TO PUBLIC ENTITIES RIGHT SORRY CLEAR OUT THAT -- MANY STATES APPLY INVERSE CONDEMNATION TO A PUBLIC ENTITY THAT -- TAKES PRIVATE PROPERTY EITHER INTENTIONALLY THAT'S SENATE MAIN OR UNINTENTIONALLY HOW BE ENFORCED -- ONLY ALABAMA INSOFAR AS WE CAN TELL HAS CASE LAW SUGGESTING THAT INVERSE CONDEMNATION SHOULD BE APPLIED TO PRIVATELY OWNED FIRMS THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN. SO THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NETWORK INDUSTRIES JESSA ALABAMA IN CALIFORNIA YES AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT IN ALABAMA. THE ALABAMA CASE IS MORE AKIN TO THE EARLY INVERSE CONDEMNATION CASES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE LEVEL OF DAMAGES IS VERY MODEST. IT IS NOT LIKE. THE SITUATION WE FACE TODAY WHERE THE LEVEL OF DAMAGES SUPPOSES YOU KNOW KIND OF AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL RISK TO THE COMPANIES. AND TO THAT PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT FLOWS FROM THAT POLICE AWAY WE USE IN CALIFORNIA IS UNUSUAL. YEAH SO. I DEFINITELY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SIR. I'LL DOT WHO REALLY PRETTY. COMING TO THE CAPITAL -- TO INFORM US OF ALL THESE THINGS AND ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME I TURN THE MEETING OVER THE NEXT PANEL -- TO CHAIR HOLD [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COVER ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT THAT CERTAINLY WAS A PRESENTATION THAT WAS -- TIMELY AND AND TOUCHED ON A LOT OF IMPORTANT ISSUES. THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE NEXUS WILL DO AS WELL. OF THIS IS GOING TO ADDRESS ENSURING A SAFE AND RELIABLE ELECTRIC GRID. AND I'D LIKE TO CALL THE PANEL OF FORWARD WHO WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS PART OF OUR HEARING TODAY. MICHAEL PICKER PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION [inaudible] ELIZAVETA -- SHINKO. DIRECTOR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TOM PORTER. CHIEF SOUTHERN REGION CAL FIRE. AND BRIAN DISGUSTING NO DIRECTOR FIRE SCIENCE AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC. WELCOME ALL OF YOU [inaudible] MR. THANK YOU AGAIN. THESE ARE ALWAYS DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS AROUND SAFETY POEM AND SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I TAKE EVERYTHING WHAT'S THERE WITH EXTREME GRAVITY THE FACT THAT PEOPLE'S LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST THAT. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE AT STAKE PROPERTY DAMAGE DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM. THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE OVERSEE. ALWAYS KEEPS ME -- ON UP LATER TONIGHT. I HAVE TO SAY THAT THAT FIRES ARE NOT SOMETHING I THOUGHT I WOULD DEAL WITH WHEN I CAME TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION BUT IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THEY ARE BECOMING A BIGGER AND MORE DRAMATIC ISSUE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS ALREADY SET A RECORD PACE FOR NEW WILDFIRES AND OTHER CONDITIONS REMAIN PRIME FOR MORE WE NOW APPEAR TO HAVE A NEVER ENDING WILDFIRE SEASON IN CALIFORNIA MUCH OF THE WEST. DROUGHT DRY SOIL HIGH WINDS AND OTHER EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS THINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN THE METEOROLOGICAL RECORDS IN THE PAST CONTINUE TO ENDANGER THE STATE IN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION THE CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUE TO BE IN JEOPARDY. SERVER DE TESTIFIED ABOUT -- AYE IN OTHER SETTINGS ON OUR STRONG NEW RULES AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND WE'VE -- RECENTLY -- PUT FORWARD VARIOUS -- CONSISTENT RULES ACROSS THE STATE FOR DE ENERGIZING DISTRIBUTE DISTRIBUTION LINES BEFORE BEACH DURING WINDSTORMS. AND DO ADDITIONAL WHERE I REQUIRE THAT WHEN A FIRE OCCURS UTILITIES RESPOND QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY SONG -- THAT INCLUDES WATER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT SERVICES OF ACT. AVAILABLE AND THAT THEIR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. WE'RE ABOUT TO ADOPT THOSE PARTICULAR MEASURES IN A PROPOSED DECISION WHICH IS OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AND AND UNDER EXISTING LAW SO WERE TASKED WITH REVIEWING WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLAN SUBMITTED BY THE UTILITIES WHICH ARE -- DIRECTOR OF SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT DIVISION POLICE VEDA MALASHENKO CAN SPEAK TO HI. ANOTHER IMPORTANT -- EFFORT HAS BEEN TO WORK MUCH MORE CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATE SAFETY AGENCIES WHILE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION WE ARE DEEMED A INDEPENDENT AGENCY. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK UNLESS WE WORK WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES WHO ARE ALSO WORKING IN THE SAME FIELDS THAT WE ARE. SO WHILE WE HAVE AGREEMENTS -- DO THE DIRECTOR MALASHENKO IS LEADERSHIP OF WITH OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND WORKOUT WITH CAL FIRE. ONE OF THE PRIMARY FOCUSES OF OUR WORK WITH CAL FIRE HAS BEEN THE EFFORT TO TARGET STRINGENT TREE IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. WHICH REQUIRED TRANSFORMING EARLIER STATE FIRE MAPS FROM A GENERAL MODELING GENERAL FIRE HAZARDS TO REAL STATE OF THE MARK ART MODEL THAT FOCUSES ON IGNITION RISK DUE TO AND UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IN DROUGHT. IN EXTREME FIRE WIND EVENTS. BUT BEYOND THAT WE THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO DEVELOP A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE OF THE FOUR POINT TWO MILLION -- WOODEN POLES TO CARRY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHO OWNS THEM THEY'RE UPDATED CONDITIONS WHAT'S ATTACHED THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN WINDSTORMS IS -- HAS EACH PIECE OF HAITIANS OR ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ATTACHED TO PULL ACTS LIKE A SEAL. YOU CAN MAKE THEM SUSCEPTIBLE TO OVERTOPPING A BREAKAGE. AND HOW THAT LOADING CAN -- CAN AFFECT THE POTENTIAL FOR FAILURES IN PUBLIC SAFETY SO. WERE ALSO REFINING NEW RULES FOR ENFORCEMENT WHICH BEEN LACKING WITH TELECOM EQUIPMENT ISN'T DUH WELL ATTACHED FOR HASN'T BEEN -- REPLACED IN A TIMELY FASHION. WHEN HE WENT ELECTRIC UTILITY REPLACES A POLL WE I RECENTLY TOURED A VARIETY OF -- OF SETTINGS IN -- IN SANTA CLARA THIS IS A FOLLOW ON TO MY VISITS TO TO OTHER FIRE SITES IN CALIFORNIA. AND FREQUENTLY WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THE ELECTRIC UTILITY WORKPLACE THE PAUL. A TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT IS JUST SORT OF DANGLING THERE OR IS ATTACHED WITH ROPES AND THEY DON'T RISK. ON THAT'S A HACER. WHAT I DO NEED TO POINT OUT I THINK IT'S BEEN STATED IN SOME RESPECTS? THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO AREAS OF ELEVATED AND SEVERE FIRE RISK WHAT WE CALL THOUGH WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. SO IN THE NORTH PART OF STATE THAT'S RECALL WE'VE ARE ON THIS YEAR AND AND SISKIYOU IN FORCE BUTTON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S RECALL WE CHAPARRAL. AND HERE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE HITS OAK WOODLAND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT -- PHONE FIRE SETTINGS HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS AND PRESENT DIFFERENT KINDS OF CHALLENGES. WE'RE NOT FIRE SCIENTISTS WERE NOT BY BOTANISTS WERE ECONOMIC REGULATORS LEESER HARD THINGS FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. AND THAT'S WHY WE PRIZED ARE GROWING RELATIONSHIP WITH CAL FIRE BECAUSE OF THEIR FIRE THEIR SCIENTISTS. AND BECAUSE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT FIRE BEHAVIOR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM WORKING WITH THEM IS THAT THE SIZE OF THE FIRE RISK AREAS GROWN PRETTY DRAMATICALLY THIS PREVIOUS FIREMEN UP WHICH WE CALLED THE INTERIM FIRE MAPS FIRE THREAT MATCH COVERED ABOUT THIRTY ONE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. THE NEW MAP MORE THAN DOUBLES THAT TO SEVENTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. THAT'S 44% CALIFORNIA'S LANMAN THE NEW MAP ALSO INCLUDES CALIFORNIA TREE MORTALITY HIGH HAZARD ZONES WHICH ENCOMPASS ABOUT NINE MILLION ACRES AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES WITH DIED TO DROUGHT AND BARK BEETLES. SO I THINK THIS IS THAT'S PRINCIPALLY IN THE SIERRA FORESTS IN THE SISKIYOU USE BUT WE ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF ADVANCING ON DIE TEMPERATURES CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTING OTHER TREE POPULATIONS. SO WHEN PEOPLE MOVE FURTHER OUT FROM DENSE URBAN CONCENTRATIONS THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE [inaudible] CHENEY'S. WE DON'T TELL THEM TO MOVE THEIR WE TELL THE UTILITIES THE YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SERVE. YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT INFEST -- SO THAT. PUTS MORE -- STRAIN ON OUR RESOURCES THE FIRE AGENCIES AND AND AND YOU TOLD THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WE CURRENTLY REQUIRE. UTILITIES TO CONNECT VIRTUALLY EVERY HOME EVERY BUILDING. IN EVERY BUSINESS IN THESE GROWING FIRE RISK AREAS THERE'S ABOUT OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION HOUSING UNITS. AND WHO LIVE WITH THAT IN WITHIN THIS FIRE -- THREATS OWNS WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE'S ABOUT A MILLION WOODEN POLES AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES OF OVERHEAD ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION LINES CROSSING THROUGH. SPANNING FIRE HAZARD ZONES JUST TO SERVE THESE GROWING POPULATIONS. ARE WE NEED REAL STRONG CENTRAL MANAGEMENT OF THE GRID FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT MORE DETAILED WILDFIRE MAPS -- WE NEED TO CONTINUE VARGAS AN EXISTING WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS INCLUDING ENSURING UTILITIES ARE IMPLEMENTING THE PLANTS UPDATING THE PLANTS ACTUALLY ADDRESSING. THE SAFETY CULTURES THAT THE UTILITIES I BELIEVE THAT -- DOCTOR OR SPOKE TO THAT. THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR US WE STARTED TO ACTUALLY AUDIT TOP TO BOTTOM HOME A ONE UTILITY TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT. THAT TOP TO BOTTOM EVERYBODY IS CONSCIOUS AND ACTIVE ON THESE ISSUES WHAT IS THE BOARD. TO WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT AN INCIDENT HOW DO THEY REACT WHAT QUESTIONS DO THEY ASK WHAT TAX INTO THEY TAKE WHO DO THEY HOLD ACCOUNTABLE -- I THINK THAT WE ALSO WERE INTERESTED IN IN IN OTHER AGENCIES ESTABLISHING -- BEST PRACTICE MODELS FOR ZONING AND BUILDING CODES. ARE AND DUH I ALSO MENTION INTO CONCURRENCE IN THE CPUC WILDFIRE DECISION WE HAVE -- TO REFINE THE LEGAL FRAME. TAKE COUNT ALL THESE CHANGES. I HAVE TO SAY THAT MANAGING AN OPERA IN THE GRID ITSELF CAN'T BE PARCELED OUT EASILY. JUST LIKE THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM THE WIRES AND POLES OF THE GRID HAVE TO HAVE SOME CONSISTENT MANAGEMENT ACROSS GEOGRAPHY IN ORDER TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. VOLTAGES HAVE TO MATCH UP. WHERE YOU HAVE A SITUATION LOS ANGELES IT LAUP IT HAS DIFFERENT VOLTAGES THAN THE REST OF THE STATE'S GRITS MAKES IT VERY HARD TO SHARE RESOURCES AND AND ANTI TIMES? OPERATORS HAVE TO HAVE VERY CLOSE COMMUNICATION ESSENTIALLY TO THE MILLISECOND. THE ARCHITECTURE THE GRID HAS TO BE CAREFULLY DESIGNED SO THE POWER GOES WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO -- AND WITH THE FORCE IT'S WELL WITHIN THE DESIGNED LIMITS OF THE SYSTEM. SO HERE THE YOU THE ROLE THE UTILITY IS NOT BY CONTRACT FROM INDEPENDENT GENERATORS TO AND THEN TO TO WE'LL THAT ELECTRICITY TO CUSTOMERS. BUT IS TO PROVIDE A RELIABLE AND SAFE DELIVERY SERVICE FROM OF VERY COMPLEX MACHINE. IT LOOKS. PEOPLE SEE PART WIRES AND POLES BUT IT'S NOT IT'S VERY DYNAMIC HOW IT OPERATES -- WIRES AMPLE -- PULLS IN UTILITY EQUIPMENT TO LOOK DELINEATE A VERY IMPORTANT THAT. I HAVE TO STRESS THE FACT THAT THE NETWORK IS NOT EASY TO TO DIVIDE. COMPLEX IN ITS A LARGE UNDERTAKING THAT PROVIDES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF VALUE TO CUSTOMERS NOT JUST -- ELECTRICITY BUT ALSO TELECOMMUNICATIONS. SO WHAT I HAVE TO I CAN'T. GO ARE FEW FALSE ASSURANCES LIKE IN A WAY I THINK THAT THAT'S NOT RIGHT. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WHILE IT'S CHIU OUR NEW FAR ROLES ARE THE TOUGHEST IN THE COUNTRY. WILL ALSO BE EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE GONE FURTHER BUT OUR RATE PAIR ADVOCATES REMINDED US. THAT THERE'S A COST THE SAFETY THEY OPPOSED THE NEW FIRE AND VEGETATION MAN [inaudible] PROGRAMS. THERE WE NEED TO CONSTANTLY EVALUATE THIS COST TO MAKE SURE THE RATES ARE ARE JUST AND REASONABLE -- BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A PLAN DOESN'T REALLY. ALLOW THE UTILITIES ARE OFF THE HOOK WE CAN'T JUST BECAUSE WE APPROVE A PLAN IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT AND THE ULTIMATELY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO OPERATE THEIRS THEIR SYSTEMS -- SAFELY AND BASED ON ON THE STANDARDS. SO WE GET BETTER SETTING OF STANDARDS. WE'VE DONE THAT WE'VE ADOPTED TO CHANGING AND ON EXPECTED CONDITIONS THE NEUFELD VEGETATION MAPPING DUE IN PART WHAT -- WHAT THE -- PROFESSOR WORSE AT THE ARE GOING TO REALLY. REQUIRE CUTTING BACK -- OF VEGETATION IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE. NOT EVERYWHERE THE PLACES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IDENTIFIED MY SUSPICION. IS THAT WITH THE ADVANCING TEMAS TEMPERATURE ONGOING DROUGHTS. TEEN YOU'D DUH MOVEMENT OF POPULATION STE A FIRE HAZARD AREAS WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO ADAPT THOSE MAPS DURING CREDIBLY GRANULAR. BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TO FOLLOW POPULATION MOVEMENTS AND DROUGHT AND THE FUEL AND AND CONTINUE TO ADAPT THEM -- SO I I JUST I WISH I COULD SAY THAT WE HAVE A PERFECT SYSTEM AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF OF MAKING SURE THAT IT'S APPLIED I THINK WE ARE CONSTANTLY. GOING TO BE ADVANCING. AND IMPROVING ON PAST PRACTICES I THINK THAT -- THAT IT MAY BE THAT PERFECT SAFETY AND THE AIR UP WHERE WERE RD SEEING MORE FIRES MORE MORE FEROCIOUS STORM FIRE START MORE FEROCIOUS WINDS [inaudible] DRIER SOILS. AND DIE AND ALMOST NO HUMIDITY DURING WIND EVENTS ALL UNPRECEDENTED NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- SAFETY JUST MADE NOT BE PERFECT. AND SO PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE AT RISK NO MATTER HOW HARD WE WORK. AS THE GOVERNOR SAID IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE WE CAN'T FIGHT NATURE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN HOW. TO GET ALONG WITH HER. SO I THINK THAT MAY ACTUALLY IS THE IS THE THE GOOD DOCTOR SAID DUH MEAN RETHINKING WHERE AND HOW DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS. AND AND BUILDING STANDARDS -- IF IT CONTINUES TO TO EXPAND IN THE URBAN WILDLAND IN. FOR INTERFACING CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WERE LIVING IN THOSE FIRE HAZARD AREAS EXPECTED TO GROW TO FIVE MILLION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGED WHO WORK HARD WILL DO OUR BEST. BUT I WANT EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER PERFECTION THEIR WILL BE A INCREMENTAL RISK SO LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO INTERMINGLE BAR URBAN DEVELOPMENT WITH A WILDLAND. INTERFACE. SO I THINK COOLEY SAVANNAH MAY HAVE SAID SOME THINGS TO ADD TO MY COMMENTS. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO US SPEAK HERE TODAY. I LEAD THE SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AT THE CPUC WHICH INCLUDES OVERSIGHT OF UTILITY AND RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE OVERALL GROUP GOOD IS COMPRISED OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY STAFF ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT OF THEM ARE IN THE ELECTRIC AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SAFETY PROGRAM. OF THIS GROUP LEAD THOUGH PERFORMS AUDITS AND INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS. AS WELL AS SUPPORTS THE COMMISSION IN DEVELOPMENTS OF ELECTRIC AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SAFETY POLICY. OF THE SIZE OVER A GROUP -- IN THE LECTURE EXCEEDS TWO MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN ENGINEERS WHO COVERED ALL OF ELECTRIC AND TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE. OF FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE CBC RECOGNIZE THAT I OWE THIS WAS INSUFFICIENT -- TO TACKLE ALL OF THE ISSUES RESOURCES INCLUDING ELSE THREE PEOPLE TO SPECIALIZE AND WILD FIRE. WELL PREVENTION. AND AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WERE BUSY HIRING AND TRAINING HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL STAFF. THEY WOULD JUST ABOUTS ONBOARD LAST FALL. ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT IN TWENTY SEVEN SEEM -- WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL FIRE. O. WHICH WAS -- MEMORIALIZE THROUGH A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE SIGNED LAST YEAR. PRESIDENT PICKER MENTIONED SOME AREAS SO WE ARE WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER -- IN THE DISH AND A WE HAVE BE IN THIS YEAR DEVELOPING DETAILED REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES. FOR WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS -- TO GO BEYOND WHAT UTILITIES CURRENTLY SUBMIT AS PART OF THEIR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE FILINGS. OF TODAY THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN PROACTIVE IN ADOPTING THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ELECTRIC STANDARDS ILL IN THE NATION MOST OF THE STATE'S HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS PRO MILLER PRIMARILY ON RELIABILITY RATHER THAN SAFETY. OF MOST OF THE STATES IN THE U. S. FULL SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE. DEVELOPED BY THE ELECTRIC AT ALL IN THE STREET. A THE HOUSES ON THE VEGETATION MANAGER. CLEARANCE IS NOT HARD REQUIREMENTS -- CALIFORNIANS WERE AGAIN ARE THE ONLY STATES THAT HOW HARD REQUIREMENTS SO ON THE DISTRIBUTION ALICE THE STUMP OF EDUCATION CLEARANCE AT ALL -- HOME. WILL SOMEHOW O. STRICTER O. POLLUTING OUR CALCULATIONS STANDARDS AT SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF WHERE THE CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS EXCEED. ABOUT THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODES [inaudible] OH THE O. COMMISSION ALSO ADOPTED THE FIRE HEALTH THREAT MOPS THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT AND ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. OF THESE NEW REGULATIONS REQUIRE UTILITIES TO MAINTAIN THAT EVEN STRICTER VEGETATION -- CLEARANCE STANDARDS AND I'LL MANDATE UTILITIES TO PRIORITIZE CORRECTIONS OF SAFETY HAZARDS BASED IN PART ON WHETHER THE SAFETY HAZARD IS LOCATED AND HI FI A THREAT. DISTRICT -- ALSO THE NEW REGULATIONS INTRODUCED NEW MINIMUM PATROL AND DETAILED INSPECTION CYCLES FOR OVERHEAD COMMUNICATION LINES WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE EXPANDING NUMBER OF COMMUNICATION FACILITIES WHICH ARE OFTEN OH COAL LOW KEYED AND WITH ELECTRIC FACILITIES ON UTILITY POLES -- AND THIS YEAR OH MY GROUP ALSO STARTED USING THE FIRE THREAT MAP TO FOCUS AND PRIORITIZE OUR AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS OF ELECTRIC AND TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE -- SINCE SO O. THE ADOPTION OF THE FIRE THREAT MAPS THE PCS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CAL FIRE ON THE EXPANDING THE SUFFERED BY DEVELOPING -- BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WIND CONDITIONS O. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE HOPE A REPORT THAT IS -- SCHEDULED TO COME OUT O. LEADER THIS YEAR WHOM. ON OUT HOWTO BUILD UPON THE FIGHT THRUPP MAPS -- WITH -- BETTER UNDERSTANDING ALL OF WIND CONDITIONS WHICH IS REALLY A CRITICAL OF A WOMAN'S WHEN WE ARE CONSIDERING  <u>THE OVER</u> WILL -- THREAT OF WILDFIRES [inaudible] HOME. IN JULY OF THE COMMISSION ALSO ADOPTED A POLICY FOR UTILITIES TO FOLLOW ONE PROACTIVE LEADS THE ENERGIZING. ELECTRIC LINES AS A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. OTHER COMMISSION REQUIRE UTILITIES TO MEET WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY MAY BE IMPACTED. NOBLE A FUTURE DO YOU KNOW JUST A CERTAIN EVENTS WELL BEFORE PUTTING THESE PRACTICES IN THE FACT -- IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA AND TO PROVIDE A CUSTOMER NOTIFICATIONS PRIOR -- TO IDEA DE ENERGIZING LINES OF OPERATIONALLY FEASIBLE -- WITHIN NINETY DAYS UTILITIES ARE A AND FOR IN WORKSHOPS O. WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM STATE AGENCIES. TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS O. LOCAL AGENCIES AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY ALL THESE EVENTS. THE PURPOSE OF THE WORKSHOPS IS TO EXPLAIN AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK ON THE UTILITIES -- DE IMAGES NATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE YEAR UTILITIES ARE ALSO NOW REQUIRED TO SUBMIT REPORTS TO THE CPC STAFF UP TO DE ENERGIZING OUTLINES. IN THE CBC WILL BE MONITORING THESE EVENTS CLOSELY OUT TO SEE HOW THIS -- PROGRAM IS SO PUT INTO EFFECT. AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THESE PRACTICES ARE WORKING IN MAY BE EL. AND THE COMMISSION MAY CONSIDER ADOPTING ADDITIONAL OF REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES. WELL LAST TIME SO WHEN THEY APPEAR BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE I TALKED ABOUT THE FIRE IGNITION DATA THAT THE UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THE ANNUAL BASIS AB TO THE PC. EL WOULD BE RECEIVING THIS DATA SINCE -- TWENTY FIFTY IN. AND ALL WE HAVE A TOTAL OF TO HUNT A TWO THOUSAND IGNITIONS IT TO THE COMMISSION. FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE UTILITIES OF REPORTED A COMBINED SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE OH INCIDENTS WHERE -- THEY HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR FACILITIES WERE INVOLVED IN THE LIGHTING A FIRE. OWE THE MAJORITY OF THESE ARE MINOR. FOR HELP BUT DOES THE TO GIVES A SUPPORT INSIGHT AS TO WHAT'S -- DRIVES SO IGNITIONS. AND IT CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THAT THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE IS SO VEGETATION O. FALLING INTO UTILITY OF LINES. SO THESE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE OWE THE UTILITY FACILITIES ARE NOT FEELING AS IN THE NATIONAL STEP IT'S ACTUALLY JUST VEGETATION THAT'S COMING AND CONTACTS -- WITH THE LINES SO ABOUT A QUARTER OF WHO AND HOME. IGNITIONS ARE ATTRIBUTED SO TO OF VEGETATION CONTACT OH IN VARIOUS EARL SOMEWHERE Y. TERRITORY WITH THE YOU ARE IN THE NORTH OR THE SOUTH BOY OVERALL OUT THAT TREND IS -- CONSISTENCE AND L. PART OF THE CHALLENGE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING ANTS OF EDUCATION MANAGEMENT WHEN IT COMES -- TO ELECTRIC LINES FACILITIES AND AGGRESSIONS IS BY -- ON THE WINDS OF FIFTEEN FIFTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR YOU HOPE HOLDS. TREES AND BRANCHES OUT THAT FAIL. O. HOME SO THAT THAT WAS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUDGET SEE FROM THE OUTSIDE OVER UTILITY CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS. ELM AND THAT'S ALSO GOES BEYOND A JUST DEAD AND DISEASED TREES THAT YOU'RE IDENTIFYING HOW POTENTIALLY DURING PATROLS. OMA SO. NOW THAT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGE OH WOULD THAT WOULD THAT DATE AND WHY WE SEEING. HOME I THINK SUCH HIGH WELL NUMBERS OF OF THE JUST THIESSEN RELATED ADMISSIONS -- THE SECOND BILL LEADING BECAUSE OVER CONDITIONS ACCORDING TO THE STATE THAT IS SO WIRES DOWN. HOME SO THAT'S THE CONDUCTORS ARE COMING DOWN O. FROM THE POLLS WERE FAILING L. AT THE SPLICE. HOME THAT ACCOUNTS ó FOR WELL IT'S ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT'S HOME OF ALL OF THE IGNITIONS REPORTED BY THE UTILITIES -- THE YOU KNOW THE PIECE IS STAFF FOCUSED ON AND IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES AND SOLUTIONS TO UTILITY THE AFIRE IGNITIONS AND WELFARE PREVENTION [inaudible] WELL. I GROUP THESE POLICIES AND THREE EL AREAS OF FIRES NEEDS SORT OF THREE THINGS TO SPREAD SO. NEED FUEL ó AND THAT MISSION SOURCE AND SPECIFIC WEATHER CONDITIONS ALSO FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS TO DO WITH THE SO FUEL REDUCTION. SO IT'S ANYTHING FROM UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM BUT ALSO GOING BEYOND THAT IN FIRE WAS WILLIAM FORESTS AND MANAGING THE WILDLAND. URBAN INTERFACE OF THE SECOND SET OF POLICIES AROUND SO YOU UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURES SOURCE OF IGNITION SO THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN LOOK AT HOME. INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING. HOME SURGES GOING AFTER THE SORT OF THE CORE THAT THE FIRST PROBLEM ELM. ALL OF WIRES DOWN OWE YOU CAN DO THINGS TO STRENGTHEN ó A CONDUCTORES AND INCREASE WAITED WHAT EXPANSIVE THAT CAN IMPROVE THE SAFETY OWN. FACTORED WAY THOUGH ENSURING THAT WIRES DO HOME BLOW INTO EACH OTHER FOR EXAMPLE WHEN AND HOW YOU HAVE HIGH WIND CONDITIONS. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES AROUND POLICIES ON AND IGNITION PREVENTION HOME. AND THEN THIRDLY IS THE WEATHER AND THINGS THAT WE CAN DO -- TO BUILD A BETTER SEAT. AND SEE GRANULAR CONDITIONS AT THE POINTS WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN WE FACING SUCH YOU YOU LARGE SCALE CHALLENGE. THAT WE HOW MILLIONS OF POLLS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LINES OF CONDUCTORS OWE MORE THAN ó THREATS [inaudible] HOME AREAS. HOME WE HAVE TO GET A LOT MORE GRANULAR AND IN TERMS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE NO WE SEE THAT WE HAVE -- RISKS AND WHEN ANNA AND GET SURGICAL AND AND OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND -- SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE CAPABILITIES THAT WE CAN BE BUILDING A HOME IN THE SORT OF WEATHER ó RELIEF DID HEALTH POLICIES -- SO SO. WELL IT WAS STAFF AT THE COMMISSION -- OR FOCUSED ON CONDUCTING AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS OF THE FACILITIES. ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS THEM INTO UTILITY INCIDENTS INCLUDING OUT THE FIRES -- AND WORLD SO -- SUPPORTING HIM. THE POLICY DEVELOPMENTS AND LOOKING FOR A HOME BEST PRACTICES TO PUT INTO PLACE TO PREVENT -- FIRES FROM HAPPENING. IN THE FUTURE EL THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY HOLE FOR THE CPC. A GOAL IS TO MAKE A TANGIBLE A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE AREAS THAT ARE MOST AT RISK OF WILDFIRES -- AND EL. YEAH. BUT THIS IS GOES BEYOND THE PC WILL HAVE A REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP ó WAS CAL FIRED THAT'S BE IN THE ESSENTIAL. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE QUIRKS PARTIES WILD FIRES HOME AND FIRE FIGHTING. ELSE WE RELY ON THE EXPERTISE OF CALIFORNIA HOME. WELL AS WE GROW I KEEP ABILITIES IN THIS AREA. HOW AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL? OWN ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER FLAYED THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. BURGER ALL THE PRISONERS IN THEM OKAY -- THANK YOU OF CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AND AND DODD FOR HOLDING THIS AND MEMBERS. OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING US MY NAME'S TOM PORTER I AM THE A REGION SHE FOR CAL FIRE AND A REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORESTER AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH -- FOR ALL THE COMMENTS YOU MADE PREVIOUSLY -- RELATED -- TO THE THANK YOUS TO OUR DEPARTMENT FOR RESPONSE BUT ALSO MY CONDOLENCES I'D BEEN WITH MANY OF YOU ON THE GROUND -- AT YOUR DISTRICTS [inaudible] HAD -- MEMBERS OF YOUR DISTRICT THAT THAT -- ARE NO LONGER WITH US AND LOTS OF PROPERTY LOSS AND DAMAGED. AND I CONDOLENCES FROM MYSELF AND AND ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENT -- FOR THAT -- THIS YEAR AS WAS REFERENCED ALREADY IS -- TURNING OUT TO BE -- MORE ACTIVE EVEN THAN LAST YEAR AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- WE HAVE MORE FIRES MORE ACRES BURNED THUS FAR THAN WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS AS YOU KNOW A RECORD YEAR FOR US AND THAT WE'RE ON TRACK -- TO AT LEAST BREAK THOSE RECORDS AND WE WILL HOPE NOT TO BREAK OTHER RECORDS -- THE RIGHT NOW WE'RE ENGAGED AND EIGHT EXTENDED ATTACK -- MULTIPLE DAY FIRES ACROSS THE STATE. A WE HAVE FIREFIGHTERS -- ON ON THE TWO BIGGEST FIRES FIRES -- THE WITH THE ONE THE CAR FIRE UP IN SHASTA COUNTY WHICH IS GROWING QUITE A BIT TODAY NUMBER IT LAUNCHING -- INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM PEAK -- AND THEN THE FERGUSON FIRE -- THE FERGUSON FIRED THIS MORNING WAS THE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY NINE THOUSAND ACRES AND 25% CONTAINED -- ONE OF THE THE THINGS THAT THE FERGUSON FIRE -- HAS ETCHED INTO OUR MEMORY IS THAT. THAT WE ARE NOT INVINCIBLE AS FIRE FIGHTERS AND THE FIREFIGHTING COMMUNITY EITHER -- WE LOST ONE OF OUR HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATORS ON THAT FIRE BRADEN BARNEY -- IT WAS VERY SAD DAY -- WE LAID HIM TO REST ON MONDAY. AND IT BROUGHT BACK -- DIFFICULT MEMORIES FROM THE THOMAS FIRE IN KOREA IVERSON -- WHO ALSO LOST HIS LIFE IT'S NOT INTERESTING TO NOTE BUT THANKFUL THAT THE LAST FIREFIGHTERS TO LOOK -- DIE IN THE LINE OF DUTY WAS -- CHRISTOPHER DOUGLAS IN RIVERSIDE SENATOR STONE I KNOW YOU REMEMBER THAT WELL. AND AND IT'S I AM I I HAD TO MENTION THOSE NAMES -- WE WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY STARTING TO LOSE FIRES AT A HIGH. FIREFIGHTERS AT A HIGHER RATE. AS WELL WITH THESE LARGE AND DAMAGING FIRES. SO. WHAT'S GOING ON WE'VE WE HAVE CLIMATE CHANGE AS AND INDUCING FACTOR -- TO WHAT WE'VE IT DUBBED THE NEW. THE NEW NORMAL IS NO LONGER THE NOR NEW NORMAL IT IS THE NORMAL AND I THINK -- THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED -- FROM FROM YOUR DYESS -- WE WE ARE SEEING -- A CONFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IGNITION SOURCES AND AND VEGETATIVE FUELS THAT ARE IN DESICCATED -- STATES [inaudible] AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT IS MAKING FOR A VERY DIFFICULT A CONDITION FOR ALL OF US IN OUR WILD FIRE SETTING. IT IF THOSE THREE FACTORS A COMBINED -- TO ELEVATE THE WILDFIRE RISK TO LIFE AND PROPERTY WHICH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. IN MY THIRTY YEARS AS A AS A REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORESTER I I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A VOLATILE CONDITIONS ACROSS THE SKATERS WE'VE HAD. I WAS IN SAN DIEGO DURING THE OF THE BEETLE KILL EPISODES THAT WE HAD IN THE TOO EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. AND TO SEE THE STATE OF OUR FOREST IN THE SIERRAS AND OTHER PARTS THE STATE IT'S MADE MY MY STOMACH SICK JUST TO SEE. SO GALPHARM AIR IS IS RESPONSIBLE -- FOR REDUCING RISK AND AND INCREASING RESILIENCE OF OUR WATERSHEDS AND FORESTED AREAS -- THROUGH -- PROFESSIONAL AND EFFECTIVE WILDFIRE RESPONSE PROACTIVE AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND FOUR STRAIGHT FORESTRY REGULATION. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THAT -- QUITE WELL -- THE AND THANKS AGAIN TO ALL OF YOU -- AND THE GOVERNOR FOR THE AND THE A BOLD INVESTMENTS THAT YOU HAVE MADE. AND OF FOREST HEALTH INITIATIVES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- THEY ARE UNPRECEDENTED AND VERY WELL NOTICED -- THOSE THOSE ACTION IN PLACE ON THE ON THE GROUND IN THE FORM OF GRANTS. THAT -- WILL BE AVAILABLE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE BUT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE TUNE OF TWO MILLION OR TWO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- AT LAST FISCAL YEAR AND ON AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION -- IN THE CURRENT BUDGET GOING FORWARD -- ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO GET THOSE SOME OF THOSE FUNDS. SO FOR DE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TO PROVIDE FOR RESILIENT COMMUNITIES AND THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY -- ALONG WITH MY UTILITY COMMISSION MEMBERS COLLEAGUES HERE IS TO ENSURING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE COORDINATED AND A LITTLE ELISABETTA -- WAS WAS CLEAR IN AND THE ITEMS THAT THAT -- WE ARE COLLABORATING ON AND AND TALKED -- VERY -- SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SEVERAL OF THOSE -- THE FIRED THREAT -- DISTRICTS THE FIRE THREAT MAP -- ELEMENTS OF THE FIRE THREAT MAP THAT ARE GOING TO BE ADDED TO INCLUDING A WIN AND AND LOADING ON THE POLLS. I WHICH IS EMPTY ACHE A KEY INFORMATION -- TO TWO ADD TO THOSE MAPS SO WILL HAVE A BETTER PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE -- BUT ALSO THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND WILDFIRE MEDICAID MITIGATION PLANS OF WHICH WE ARE -- TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND READ OF ALL OF THESE THESE ITEMS -- AND MORE -- OUR OUR IT DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMISSION ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY ON TO ENSURE THAT THAT THE BEST TECHNICAL SUPPORT AT IS GIVEN TO THE COMMISSION. AND ALSO THE FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION -- LAWS AND PUBLIC RESOURCES CORE CODER BEING MET UNDER -- CAL FIRES JURISDICTION. SO THOSE MAPS -- OR THE MAP I'LL DISCOLORED THE MAP -- FIRE THREAT MAP VERY IS IS VERY KEY TO TUNING OUR PROGRAMS FOR FIRE PREVENTION. I MENTION FIRE PREVENTION PREVIOUSLY I'M COMING BACK TO IT NOW. BECAUSE WE WE ARE -- WORKING UNDER -- DIRECTOR HIM LOTS OF LEADERSHIP TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF OUR FIVE OF OUR PRESCRIBED BURN PROGRAMS -- AND NUMBERS OF ACRES THAT WE BURN ANNUALLY -- FOR FUEL REDUCTION AND HABITAT MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS OUR OUR MANUAL FUEL REDUCTION PROJECT WORK WHICH WE CAN DO MORE SURGICALLY IN AND AROUND COMMUNITIES -- AND THEN -- IN PARTICULAR OUR INSPECTION PROGRAMS -- WE DO HAVE INSPECTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE CODIFIED IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. OF FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION -- THAT'S THE INSPECTIONS -- THAT OF THE FIRST PANEL REFER TO AS THOSE AREAS AROUND -- HABITABLE STRUCTURES WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF THAT STRUCTURE THERE'S A GRADUATED THIRTY FEET AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FEET AND THEIR DIFFERENT CRITERIA WITHIN THOSE -- SO THAT WE ARE WE ARE ENDEAVORING TO VISIT EVERY -- EVERY. HABITABLE STRUCTURE IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS -- THROUGH ARE PROGRAM AND WHO WERE VERY CLOSE TO THAT -- JUST. SLIGHTLY SHORT -- OF THAT GOAL THIS YEAR SO FAR -- BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENDEAVOR TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN -- FURTHER WE DO -- RAILROAD AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POINT SOURCE INSPECTIONS -- AND THEN -- PARTICULARLY -- PRUDENT HERE UTILITY LINE COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS -- THOSE ARE CODIFIED UNDER PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE FORTY TO NINETY TWO AND FORTY TWO NINETY THREE AND WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO INCREASE OUR PACE AND SCALE ON THOSE INSPECTIONS AS WELL OF THE FINAL FINAL ITEM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO A POINT YOUR ATTENTION TO IS -- WE HAVE A POWER LINE FIRE PREVENTION A FIELD GUIDE. AND I IT'S APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY PAGES LONG AND IT IS A REALLY THE GUY THAT THAT -- IDENTIFIES WITH PICTURES EQUIPMENT ON POLLS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OFTREATMENTS AND PRESCRIPTIONS TO REDUCE FIRE RISK -- FROM FROM THOSE AND ALSO ON THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SIDE. THAT THAT FIELD GUIDE IS IS -- BEING -- RE WRITTEN AS WE SPEAK AND WE WILL BE -- PUTTING THAT OUT SOON. SO IN CLOSING -- CAO FIRES POISED TO CONTINUE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CP YOU SEE AND BETTER PROTECT LIVES AND PROPERTY -- OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] AND THE ENEMY. ROOM AND WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MISTER CHAIRMAN MR CO CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. ARE MY NAME IS BRIAN D'AGOSTINO I'M THE DIRECTOR OF FIRE SCIENCE AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION FOR SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC. AND PART OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD WE HAVE A VERY EXTENSIVE FIRE MITIGATION PROGRAM IN SAN DIEGO SO PART OF WHAT I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS. HOW IF WE WORKED OVER THE LAST DECADE TO BUILD? IT'S NOT TO BUILD THIS MITIGATION PROGRAM AND REALLY HOW HAVE WE USED IT I'M NOT ONLY IN DECEMBER BUT EVEN JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AS WE'RE STARTING TO SEE EXTREME HEAT WAVES -- AN EXTREME FIRE POTENTIAL -- IMPART OF HOW THIS PROGRAM STARTED WHO IS WAS GATHERING WEATHER INFORMATION -- SO IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE EMBARKED ON AN EFFORT TO PUT A WEATHER STATION ON EVERY. ONE OF THE CIRCUITS THAT WE OPERATE ACROSS OUR HIGHEST RISK AREAS. AND AND WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND VALUE. AND THAT HAS COME FROM THAT NETWORK -- TODAY WE COLLECT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PIECES OF WEATHER DATA EVERY DAY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR. IT'S ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION AND OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE NOW WHERE APPROACHING A BILLION PIECES OF WEATHER DATA SO IT'S REALLY BECOMING A A BIG DATA -- WHETHER COLLECTION AND WE CAN DO LOTS OF INFORMATION -- AND MAKE LOTS OF GOOD CHOICES WITH A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION ON SOME OF THOSE EIGHT GOES AND NOT TO HELPING US BUILD TO WEATHER MODELS. BEING ABLE TO ANTICIPATE AND PREPARE. NOW FOR THESE EXTREME EVENTS WHEN THEY'RE COMING THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WE LOOK AT VERY CLOSELY SO WE OPERATE A MULTIPLE DATA SUPERCOMPUTERS IN SAN DIEGO. THAT TELL US EXACTLY HOW STRONG WE THINK THE WINDS ARE GOING TO BE AND EXACTLY WHERE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE UPDATE THOSE MULTIPLE TIMES EVERY DAY AND IT REALLY HELPS US MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN I GET CREWS AND RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT PLACES -- AT THE RIGHT TIME NOT IN ALL OF THIS INFORMATION -- THEN ENDS UP BEING SHARED -- WITH THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE -- WITH THE FIRE AGENCIES IN AND OTHER FOLKS SO A VERY VALUABLE RESOURCE -- THAT WE HAVE DOWN IN SAN DIEGO AND ALL OF THIS INFORMATION ALSO FEEDS INTO OUR TOOLS. A BIG PART OF WHAT WE'VE NEEDED TO OPERATE SAFELY AND RELIABLY IT'S AN UNDERSTANDING OF A WHAT IS THE FIRE POTENTIAL EVERYDAY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR. SO WE DEVELOPED SOMETHING CALLED THE FIRE POTENTIAL INDEX AND WHAT IT IT WAS DEVELOPED BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WITHIN THE UTILITY TEAM OF FIREFIGHTERS. AND A TEAM OF METEOROLOGISTS WE'VE COME TOGETHER AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DRIVES. HIGH FIRE DANGER IN SAN DIEGO. IN YOU CAN LOOK AND IT'S THAT THE GRASS CROP IN THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN THE LIVE VEGETATION AND THEN. THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN THE DEAD FUELS AND THEN OF COURSE THE WEATHER AND BY COMBINING ALL OF THOSE. INTO A SINGLE INDEX WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP THAT I'VE THIS ONE TOOL THAT THE FIRE POTENTIAL INDEX AND OVER TIME IT HAS GROWN OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE UTILITY. WE STARTED SHARING IT WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THEN THE CITY MANAGER'S AT ALL OF OUR LOCAL CITIES AND THEN SAN DIEGO FIRE AND RESCUE WE SEND IT TO CAL FIRE EVERY DAY THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIPS. I'VE DOWN IN SAN DIEGO. TARA SO CERTAINLY A A VERY VALUABLE -- TOOL AND SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN VERY NECESSARY IN OUR SAFE OPERATION -- DAY IN AND DAY OUT. SOMETHING I HEARD EARLIER -- IN THIS HEARING WHICH I CERTAINLY AGREED WITH WAS TAKE LOOKING AT FIRE WEATHER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND RELATING IT TO WHAT A HURRICANE COULD BE. OUR FOR THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT ONE THING THAT THEY HAD IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS A RATING WHERE IF A HURRICANE WAS COMING. YOU KNEW THEY WOULD SELL YOU IF IT WAS A CATEGORY ONE A CATEGORY THREE CATEGORY. FIVE LEADERSHIP THAT SDG ANY CHALLENGED US ARE. SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO DEVELOP A RATING SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THAT. AND OUT OF THAT PROJECT THE SANTA ANA WILDFIRE THREAT INDEX TOM WAS BORN AND IT'S NICE TO BE NEXT TO CHIEF PORTER HERE BECAUSE WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY. ON WITH HIS TEAM OF METEOROLOGISTS AND RIVERSIDE AND ALSO THE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES DEPARTMENT AT UCLA AND WE DEVELOPED THIS INDEX AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT TELLS US. ANA RATING FROM MARGINAL ALL THE WAY TWO EXTREME WHAT IS THE FIRE DANGER. WITH THIS PARTICULAR SANTA ANA WIND EVENT IN UNDERSTANDING THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT RISK BECOMES VERY CRITICAL TIME IN MITIGATING. AND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PARTICULAR SANTA ANA -- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS AVAILABLE ON TO ALL OF A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COVERS THE SEVEN NINE SEVEN MAJOR COUNTIES WE HAVE IN THE THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE. AND ITS ISSUED BY -- THE UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE ARE PREDICTIVE SERVICES AND CAL FIRE. ON EVERYDAY. SO GREAT TO HAVE A GREAT TOOL. I'VE BUT OUR OUR ANALYTICS HAS CONTINUED TO EVOLVE -- OVER THE YEARS AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW -- BECOMES FIRE BEHAVIOR MODEL LIKE IF A FIRE WHERE TO START -- EXACTLY WHERE WOULD IT GROW HOW FAST CAN WE EXPECT TO GROW ON AND WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE AND ITS WAY. AND HAVING THIS TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS IT'S BEEN REALLY THE LEADING EDGE -- OF OUR TECHNOLOGY THESE DAYS AND WITH SOME OF OUR BIG DATA -- WE ARE CURRENTLY -- SIMULATING OVER TEN MILLION VIRTUAL WILDFIRES ACROSS SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND WE'RE DOING THAT AT EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THAT TELLS US EXACTLY WHERE IF THEY FOUGHT IF A FIRE WERE TO START HERE. TODAY -- WE HAVE BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS THAT CAN TELL US WHERE IT WOULD GROW AND AND THE AREA THAT IT COULD ENCOMPASS AND THAT BECOMES REALLY GOOD INTEL -- WHEN TRYING TO OPERATE SAFELY? AND THEN AS RECENTLY AS JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AS WE START SEEING SEVERAL FIRES BREAKING OUT ACROSS SAN DIEGO. YOU CAN SIMULATE YOU GET A REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF IBM IMMEDIATE THREAT. POSTED BY SOME OF THESE A CONNECTION. ASA THESE ARE SOME SOME VERY VALUABLE -- TECHNOLOGY TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS THAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN PUSHING FORWARD. DOWN IN SAN DIEGO ITS STATE LEADING EDGE OF A LOT OF THE FIRE SCIENCE IN ITS WHERE FIRE SCIENCE IN BIG DATA MEET -- AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT FORWARD LIKE WE HAVE -- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND I FOCUSED A BIT ON THE TECHNOLOGY -- AND SOME OF THE INNOVATION THAT HAS HAPPENED ON MAJOR COMPONENT BECOMES OUR CUSTOMER OUTREACH ON THAT IS SOMETHING THAT -- WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUOUSLY WORKING ON ON AND EVOLVING UP PARTNERSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE AMERICAN RED CROSS I'M SAN DIEGO. TO ONE ONE OUR COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS LIKE THE CIRCUITS ON WE WORK WITH THESE FOLKS BECAUSE WE'RE ALL TRYING TO BE RESILIENT TOGETHER WE NOW HAVE A FIRE MITIGATION IN CLIMATE ADAPTATION GROUP -- WHICH IS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT THAT I DIRECTED NOW AND WEEP BRINGING IN A COMMUNITY RESILIENT SPECIALIST. AND PART OF IT IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND -- WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP THE COMMUNITY? A BE MORE RESILIENT AND REALLY UNDERSTAND THE RESILIENCY IN THE ADAPTATION ASPECT -- OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT IS SO AND I IMPORTANT MOVING FORWARD OTHER VERY CRITICAL ASPECTS OF OUR COMMUNITY FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM. ON WINE IS THE HELLER TANKER -- AS THE GENIE BRINGS THE LARGEST FIRE FIGHTING HELICOPTER ON THAT THERE IS IN THE UNITED STATES TO SAN DIEGO. OUGHT TO HELP FIGHT THESE FIRES AS WE IN. A SOME OF THE INTRODUCTORY MARKS FROM SENATOR STONE THE PROXIMITY TO GETTING AVIATION TO THE SITE. ARM AND HAVING WATER DROPPED ON A SITE IMMEDIATELY IS CRITICAL. ON AND WE HAD. RECOGNIZED THE CRITICALITY OF THAT NOT BECAUSE OF THAT WE BRING IN. OUR THIS HOW A TANKER YEAR ROUND TO DISPATCHED BY CAL FIRE. I'D TO IMMEDIATELY RESPOND AND HELP SUPPRESS ANY FIRES THAT BREAK OUT NOT JUST UTILITY RELATED WILDFIRES ANY WILDFIRES. THAT BREAK OUT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WE'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ON SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE OF COURSE EXTREMELY -- SERIOUSLY WE HAVE AN AWARD WINNING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND TREES WHICH ARE CURRENTLY LOGGED AND INSPECTED EVERY YEAR. ON AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT EVEN THIS YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS. ON TOP OF A HOBBY ALREADY A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM AND THAT IS IN PLACE -- SO SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN SYSTEM HARDENING WE WE'VE HEARD -- LIZA MENTIONING ABOUT -- HARDENING THE SYSTEM THERE'S ALREADY BEEN OVER A BILLION DOLLARS INVESTED IN SAN DIEGO IN FIRE HARDENING THE SYSTEM. I SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD OF EARLIER IT'S A CONVERTING WOULD POLLS TO STEAL POLLS GETTING THINGS HIGHER OFF THE GROUND SO IT'S LESS LIKELY THAT THE DEBRIS THAT WE HEAR ABOUT. AYE IT'S LESS LIKELY THAT THE DEBRIS IS GOING TO GET INTO THE LINES MOVING LINES FURTHER APART SO THAT THEY'RE LESS LIKELY. TO I COME INTO CONTACT AND IT IS A IT IS A HUGE -- HARDENING UNDERTAKING -- THROUGH ALL OF THIS BUT SOMETHING THAT -- SDG ANY IS A IS VERY COMMITTED. TO AND I WANTED -- TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RECENT EVENTS OUT BECAUSE AS WE HEAR ABOUT CLIMATE SHIFTS IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING A VERY MUCH SO IN SAN DIEGO JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE STATE AND THE RIGHT THE REST OF THE WORLD. AYE WE BROKE SOME ALL TIME HIGH TEMPERATURES EARLIER THIS MONTH ON JULY SIXTH. ON SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES NOT TOO FAR FROM THE BEACH I WOULD CONSIDER ARE FOOTHILLS WERE APPROACHING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES. AND THEY'D NEVER GONE HIGHER THAN A HUNDRED ELEVEN BEFORE -- AND AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD MULTIPLE WILD FIRES AND BREAKING OUT ALL ACROSS. AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- SO CERTAINLY A VERY UNPRECEDENTED TYPE OF EVENT FOR US IN THE MONTH OF JULY AND HISTORICALLY SPEAKING WE DO SEE FIRES IN JULY USUALLY UP IN THE MOUNTAINS AND AN AFTERNOON SEA BREEZE BUT THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT EVENT -- THAT WE EXPERIENCED ON THEIR WORST THREE OUTAGES ON OUR SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT IN JULY ON NINE THAT THE COMPANY PROACTIVELY DE ENERGIZED. AND THIS WAS THE TYPE OF EVENT ON THAT WEEK END UP TURNING OFF THE POWER ON ONE CIRCUIT NOT BECAUSE THE FIREFIGHTERS ASKED US. TO OFFER SAFETY AND WE COLLABORATE VERY CLOSELY WE HAVE RETIRED FIREFIGHTERS THAT JOIN INTO THE INCIDENT COMMAND ON THE SYSTEM AND HOW WE WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO KEEP. EVERYBODY SAFE -- DURING THESE TYPE OF EVENTS AND THEN ALSO THE THE FIRE ITSELF ON CAN CAUSE OUTAGES THROUGH THEIR BURNING INTO THE SYSTEM SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN EXPERIENCED -- EARLIER THIS MONTH. AND THE AIR CRANE WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT -- IS HAVING IT'S ON PACE TO BY FAR HAVE A RECORD YEAR IN SAN DIEGO. ON ONE FIRE LOAN EARLIER THIS MONTH THAT DROPPED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS OF WATER. ARE JUST JUST SHY OF FIFTY THOUSAND I SHOULD SAY. AND SO FAR THIS YEAR WERE APPROACHING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND GALLONS. ON THAT THE UTILITY PALITANA OCCUR. HAS RIGHT NOW CONTRIBUTED TO THE FIRE FIGHTING EFFORTS SO A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT I'M CONTRIBUTION THERE. WANTED. TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DECEMBER. AS WE'VE SPENT A DECADE DEVELOPING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM THAT WAS [inaudible] STRESSED IN DECEMBER WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EVENT THAT IMPACTED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND ULTIMATELY ONE OF THE BENEFITS WE WERE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE IT. AND WE WERE ABLE TO SEE IT COMING OUR MODELS TOLD A SEVEN TO TEN DAYS OUT. THAT THIS COULD BE I'M A TYPE OF EVENT THAT COMES AROUND. YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SAY IN OUR IN WHAT IS NOW NORMAL -- BUT OF RARE EVENT WILL SAY ONCE IN A TEN YEAR ONCE IN THE TWENTY FIVE YEAR TYPE OF EVENT. SO BEING ABLE TO SEE IT COMING WE TOOK ALL PRECAUTIONS TO MITIGATE THE RISK. THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT I'VE YOU PUT SENSITIVE RELAYS ON THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM. YOU MAKE SURE THAT ALL RE CLOSING IS TURNED OFF IN SOME CASES ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BEACH. AND YOU TAKE ALL THE STEPS TO BEGIN TO MITIGATE THAT YOU WORK WITH THE RED CROSS YOU WORK WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS -- AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE AWARE OF WHAT'S -- WHAT'S POTENTIALLY COMING ABOUT POTENTIALLY COULD HAPPEN -- BUT WHAT WE FOUND DURING THIS PARTICULAR EVENT. ON IS THAT THEIR WORD DE ENERGIZED HAITIANS FOR SAFETY -- AND THAT BECOMES THE LAST RESORT IT'S NEVER THE FOR THE FIRST THING THAT YOU WOULD DO BUT WHEN ALL OF THESE OTHER. MITIGATION OF FAT AS THE FACTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED ARE BUT THEY'RE STILL VERY SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUES THEN DE ENERGIZED ATION -- BECOMES A REAL OPTION AND IN THIS CASE YOU LOOK AT OTHER THINGS LIKE WARNINGS. ARE THERE RED FLAG WARNINGS IN A FACT IS THAT THE SANTA ANA WILDFIRE THREAD INDEX WHAT'S THE RATING ON THAT -- OUR INTERNAL TOOLS LIKE THE FIRE POTENTIAL INDEX IF ALL OF THOSE ARE TELLING US THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY RARE. VERY HIGH RISK EVENT -- WE LOOK AT WEATHER CONDITIONS FROM OUR WEATHER NETWORK -- WE'LL GET VEGETATION FUEL CONDITIONS HOW MUCH OF WHAT IS THE BURNING ENVIRONMENT FOR FIRE GOES AND WILL IT GROW EXPLOSIVELY. ON AVAILABILITY OF FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES IS IS A HUGE ONE IF THERE ARE FIRES BURNING ALL OVER THE STATE -- THAT BECOMES A BIG FACTOR AS WELL AS WINS A LOT OF TYPES CAN GROUND AND SO -- SO IF WE KNOW THAT IF A FIRE WERE TO START ALL OF THE ARE ALL OF THE AVIATION SUPPORT IS GROUNDED THAT BECOMES A VERY BIG FACTOR -- WHEN MAKING A DECISION LIKE THAT AND THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE CAME INTO IN DECEMBER -- WE WERE. MATTER WHICH DIRECTION WE LOOKED IN SAN DIEGO THERE WAS SMOKE IN THE SKY ALL AROUND US -- THE THOMAS FIRE HAD BEEN BURNING AT AN EXPLOSIVE RATE -- FOR THE PREVIOUS EIGHTEEN HOURS AND THERE WAS ALSO A LARGE FIRES DOWN IN NORTHERN BAJA -- WHICH WE WHERE I TRACKING SO WE WE AT THAT POINT HAD BEEN FULLY SURROUNDED AND WE'RE EXPECTING WINDS OF SIXTY TO NINETY MILES AN HOUR -- ACROSS OUR BACK COUNTRY IN OUR WEATHER NETWORK STARTED TO CAPTURE THAT WE ACTUALLY SAW WINDS ARE UP TO EIGHTY SEVEN MILES AN HOUR IN THE BACK COUNTRY OF SAN DIEGO UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS. I'M SO WAS EXTREMELY CRITICAL AND THAT'S WHEN WE DID TAKE THOSE STEPS -- TO DE ENERGIZED FOR FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC -- ONE OF THE BIG PIECES OF FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT AS AS SOON AS THE WINDS COME DOWN. EVERYONE SAYS OKAY LET'S LET'S TURN IT RIGHT BACK ON BUT RE ENERGIZING AYE IS A VERY LARGE EFFORT. I FOR A COUPLE REASONS WHEN THE SYSTEM IS DE ENERGIZED THERE COULD BE TREE LIMBS UNDER WIND CONDITIONS OF NINETY MILES AN HOUR THEIR COULD BE TREE LIMBS FROM HALF A MILE AWAY. THAT ARE IN THE LINE -- SO AT THAT POINT WE HAVE TO MONITOR. THE ENTIRE LINE INCH BY INCH AND LOOK AT IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN. IN THE LINES ITSELF AND THIS IS AFTER THE WINDS HAVE DROPPED LOW ENOUGH THAT WE'RE CONFIDENT NOTHING ELSE IS GOING. TO TO BLOW INTO THE LINES SOME OF THESE HAVE TO BE DONE BY HELICOPTER. AYE IN THE SAFETY OF THE PILOTS OF COURSES PARAMOUNT. AND SO EVEN AS THE WINDS IN A SANTA ANA DECREASE RIGHT THERE AT THE SURFACE THEY GET UP IN A HELICOPTER AND THEY SAY IT'S STILL REALLY WINDY APPEAR. NAM SO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR REALLY THE WHOLE EVENT. TO COME TO AN END AS WE START PATROLLING AND IN SOME CASES -- WERE PATROLLING HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF MILES -- OF LINES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CLEAR AND SAFE AND READY TO BE RE ENERGIZED SO THESE ARE SOME MAJOR FACTORS -- THAT WE LOOK AT AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND LOOK FORWARD IF THERE ARE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE DO APPRECIATE A NOT ONLY ARE PRESENTATION IT WAS VERY ENLIGHTENING IN TERMS OF WHAT -- YOU'RE TAKING THE TECHNOLOGY AND AND KIND OF LOOKING AT WHAT WAS DESCRIBED EARLIER ABOUT PC AND AS WEATHERIZATION ISSUES AND HOW. TO A GIVE US MORE INFORMATION TO BE IN A STRONGER POSITION SO I THINK THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I'M GONNA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR THE FACILITY ON FRIDAY SO IT ENCOURAGES. ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL THAT SOME POINT. A TO MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO DO SO AS WELL. ARE I'D LIKE. TO ASK A QUESTION OR TWO OF YOU MISTER PICKER AND THEN WE'LL TURN TO OTHER MEMBERS. TO EXPLORE QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE PUBLIC. THERE YOU'D MENTIONED THERE ARE BEING THE A SAFETY STANDARDS. AS A RELATED TO SAFETY STANDARDS WERE A MORE TYPICALLY BASED ON FUNDING -- RATHER THAN ON WHAT WAS NECESSARY FOR SAFETY OR MAYBE YOU CAN CORRECT ME ON ON THAT POINT BUT I BUT I GUESS IF THE PART THAT WE REALLY WANT TO GET TO IS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE MORE. APPROPRIATE TO MAYBE LOOK AT SETTING THESE SAFETY STANDARDS. I I THINK ABOUT THAT A LOT. OF BUT OUR OBLIGATION IS TO HAVE SORT OF A LEGALISTIC FRAMEWORK IT'S ALMOST LIKE A COURT IS SIMILAR TO THE ADMIRALTY COURTS WORD THEM WHEN WE AUTHORIZE EXPENDITURES A. COMES. FOR THE JUDGE WHO ALLOWS PEOPLE TO DECLARE THAT THEIR PARTIES IN THAT PROCEEDING AND THEY CAN CHALLENGE. THE UTILITIES ASSERTIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE SUITABLE EXPENDITURES. AND THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THIS BASED ON THE RECORD SO DEPENDING UPON HOW WELL THE UTILITY CAN MAKE THEIR ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHETHER AN EXPENDITURE IS REASONABLE AND JUST. AND THE EVIDENCE THAT'S PRESENTED BY PARTIES. I HOPE WE SOMETIMES DON'T HAVE THE RECORD TO MAKE A FINE THEN EXPENDITURES NECESSARY. HERE IN PART BECAUSE WE COULD RELY ON THE EFFORTS OF CALIFORNIA. AND ARE PROCEEDING AROUND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE DID NOT ACCEPT THE ARGUMENT FOR THEIR WORK FROM THE RATE PAYER ADVOCATES THAT THE EXPENDITURES THE NEW EXPENDITURES FOR IT AND MORE. EXPANDED DIVERT PROGRAM WERE INAPPROPRIATE WE FOUND THAT THEY WERE FROM. SO WE'VE BEEN ORDERED THIS THIS PAST IN THE COUNTRY [inaudible] SENATE PRACTICES [inaudible] IN THE WHO DO YOU CONSIDER THEY'RE BEING AN OPPORTUNITY OR NEED FOR THIS SAFETY STANDARDS. THEY COULD BE SAID BY. A DIFFERENT ENTITY BID THEN CLOSE THE P. YOU SEE MORE IN A POSITION OF IMPLEMENTATION SO I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR BEST PRACTICES AND SO WOULD EXAMPLE. WHAT I'VE SEEN ELSEWHERE IS FOR EXAMPLE A NUCLEAR SAFETY? WE DON'T CHALLENGE THE FINDINGS TO THE NRC. THEY SAID A SAFETY STANDARD AND THEN THE UTILITIES BRING FORWARD THEIR COST ESTIMATES WILL LOOK AT COST ESTIMATES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE REASONABLE BUT WE DON'T CHALLENGE THE STANDARD WE DON'T SET. SNOW HERE WE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S IT'S CURRENTLY OUR DUTY TO DO THAT WE WE WORK WITH CAL FIRE TO COME UP WITH -- A VEHICLE TO DO THAT AND SO UNTIL THERE'S MAYBE A STATEWIDE SAFETY AGENCY THAT DEALS WITH ALL KINDS OF SAFETY RISKS AND PUTS FORWARD STANDARDS. IT'LL ALWAYS FALL TO US TO TO DO THE SINKS WITHIN OUR EXISTING SETTING -- SO. A CHALLENGES ALWAYS OF COURSE THAT WHEN WE DO THINGS INDEPENDENT OF OTHER AGENCIES WE CAN SET A DIFFERENT STANDARD OR WE CAN UNDERCUT. OR OTHER AGENCIES CAN UNDERCUT WHAT WE COME UP WITH SO IT'S IT REQUIRES US TO BE VERY NOBLE. AND TO WORK VERY CAREFULLY FEATHER OUTSIDE AGENCIES. BUT EVEN THERE I THINK THAT THAT YOU WILL KIND OF GET PEOPLE KIND OF SHOPPING FOR THE JURISDICTION TO FIGHT OVER WHETHER SOMETHING IS REASONABLE WE AND EFFECTIVE. AND WHETHER THE EXPENDITURE IS IS IS NECESSARY. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND. SUCH A STATEWIDE AGENCY BE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO FIND A CERTAIN WAY. I THINK THAT THAT IF YOU START DOWN THAT PATH YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER INDEPENDENT AGENCIES WHO HAVE DEEP EXPERTISE IN OTHER KINDS OF INDUSTRIES AND OTHER KIND OF BEHAVIORS RANGING FROM WATER QUALITY TO THESE TOXICS TO ON HIGHWAY SAFETY. SO I THINK IT'S ROBABLY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS A WHOLE LOT OF THOUGHT I TALK A LOT WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE TO WE ASK HELLFIRE ABOUT HOW WE GET BETTER. IT SHARING INFORMATION AND COORDINATING. BUT I THINK IT'S AND IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT OUT BEYOND OUR CAR OUR PORTFOLIO TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT WHETHER SOMEBODY ELSE SHOULD DO IT. THERE ARE TIMES WE DO OUR BEST. ALRIGHT WE WOULD [inaudible] MR DOT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- CAUTIONARY NORSTAR. I'VE DOES FIT MANY HOURS WAS THE PRESIDENT PICKER AND I SPENT SOMETIME WITH CHIEF AND I JUST WANNA -- START OUT BY SAYING. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SECOND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT NOTED THAT TIME. A COUPLE YEARS BACK ON I DID STAND ON THE FLOOR AND SAY. FIRES IN EFFECT CALIFORNIA YEAH. IT'S WITH A HEAVY HEART. TO KNOW THAT WE LOST ABOUT FIFTY LIVES. THE CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM AND WE ARE HERE BECAUSE OF LIABILITY WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WHO'S GONNA PAY. AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE A FUEL LOADING PROBLEM. AND WE HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF THE TOOLS AWAY. THAT WE MANAGE THOSE HEELS WITH. I'VE DEBATED ABOUT GRAZING. I DEBATED ABOUT HOW WITHIN A FORCED. IN THE SIZE OF A TREE THAT YOU NEED TO COME OUT WHEN THEY'LL BURN DOWN. NOW WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SOME SERIOUS THINGS THAT HAPPEN HERE CALIFORNIA IF BEFORE WE LOSE. A LOT MORE LIVES AND A HELL OF A LOT OF PROPERTY DAMAGE. SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE BUT THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. WE SPENT ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. FROM 200-082-2000 AND FOURTEEN FIGHTING FIRE. AND WE LOST SOME GOOD MEN AND WOMEN OUT THERE DOING IT. WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY THEIR WE TALKED ABOUT THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ISSUES WE TALKED ABOUT. HOW WE GONNA TAKE THE BIOMASS AND PUT IT INTO A PLEA AND WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR THAT? AND BATTLED THOSE OUT BIPARTISAN IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. THIS IS A A PUBLIC PART WHETHER WE HAVE YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT IT THERE'S DEBATE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE NOT COMMITTEES MANY TIES UP WE ARE CLIMATE IS CHANGING. SO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES IN PLACES WORST. USED TO HER LAB. SO I WANTED TO SHARE YES. MY FRUSTRATION WITH. THE BILLION NOT REALLY ADDRESSED THE BIG PROBLEM THIS IS HOW ARE WE IN A MAJOR FUEL WE CAN SHUT DOWN THE GRID LIGHTING WILL STILL STRIKE. MEN MAKE BECAUSE THE A CAR CAN STARTED A RAILROAD THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS OUT THERE THAT WE DON'T. TALK ABOUT THE CAN START FIRE BUT I THOUGHT HUNDRED LEGISLATORS TO MY DISTRICT. AND I TAKE A MOUNTAIN FORCED. AND I SHAUNA FORCES OVERGROWN BECAUSE OF OUR POLICIES STOPPING WELFARE YOU CAN'T PUT WELFARE BACK IN THAT. FORCE BECAUSE THEY CROWN NOW THAT MEANS THAT THE TREES BURN. THEY'RE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER THE FIRE BURNS FROM TREE TO TREE. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE CANOPY. THAT MEANS OPEN UP THAT FOREST SO THAT FIRE CAN BURN ON THE FLOOR LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOW. AND WE CAN MANAGE THAT FIRE. WE HAVE ABOUT THE WHOLE STATE IN MY MIND IS A HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONE NOT YOU'RE ON THE COAST WE'LL HEAR THAT JACKSON LIVES. IT'S BRUSH THEIR WHO NEED TO MANAGE THAT AND IT'S A LIVE. ONE THING I THINK GO OUR CONSTITUENTS DONOR STAND IS THAT IT IS GROWING EVERY SINGLE DAY. IS GROWING UP THERE RIGHT NOW. AND IT WILL BURN. UNLESS WE MANAGE THAT FUEL. WE HAVE TO GET THE IDEOLOGY OF COTTON A CERTAIN SIZE TREE OR PUTTING GRAZING IN OR WHATEVER THOSE TOOLS ARE WE GOING TO START TALKING ABOUT THOSE TOOLS. THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US THAT DON'T COST OUR RATE PAYERS AND OUR TAXPAYERS USUALLY PAY FOR IT THAT AT THE UTILITY BILL ARE GONNA PAY FOR BY PUTTING MEN AND WOMEN IN HELICOPTERS AND AVIATION AND BULLDOZERS AND ALL THAT OTHER THEN YOU'RE GONNA PAY. FOR WHEN YOU GET YOUR WATER BILL BECAUSE AFTER BURNS THE REAL DEVASTATION COMES IN WE HAVE THE SLIDES WE HAVE HUGE. HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF WATERSHED THIS DESTROYED FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. SO I KNOW I'M RAMBLING BUT I'M I'M I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS THE FUEL LOADING OUT THERE WE NEED TO PUT THE TOOLS AND POLICIES IN PLACE THAT ALLOW US TO START DIRECTING THAT. PROBLEM THIS IS BEEN THERE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. AND THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR YOU DON'T ADDRESS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S JUST WHAT THE WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID. THERE'S THE WATER QUALITY PART OF IT THERE'S THE FORESTRY PART OF IT THERE'S THE FIREFIGHTING PARTS OF IT THERE'S A LIABILITY PART OF IT THERE'S ALL THESE MOVING PIECES. THAT IS HOPEFULLY [inaudible] GOT HOME. HE DID IN THIS HEARING WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE IN THAT WE TAKE THE TIME. NOT TO JUST FIX TO WHOEVER THE BEST LOBBYIST OF THE DAY IS TO GET THERE WHATEVER THEY NEED TO GET DONE WE ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE REAL ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. AND FIX IT FOR THE LONG TERM OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] CHAIR -- FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO SAY -- WELL THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND I'M I I WANT. TO SAM REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT'S GONE ON SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC AND I'M ACTUALLY. I'M CURSED BY THAT IN MY OWN COUNTY CINEMA COUNTY WHERE I LIVE OUR WATER AGENCIES LOOKING AT TRYING TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD I'M I WANT TO GET DOWN TO VISIT WITH YOU I I I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THINK EVERYBODY ON THIS DIET SHOULD BE DOWN TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE I THINK. IT IT IS A ROLE MODEL FOR HOW WE CAN HOW WE DO THINGS GOING FORWARD SO I APPRECIATE PRETTY PRESENTE. BUT YOU WANT TO COME BACK TO SOME THINGS THAT HAVE THAT DO DE DO CONCERN ME I THINK. TO PICK A YOU SAID RIGHTFULLY SO WE ARE NOT FIRE SCIENTISTS I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED YOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH CAL FIRE -- ON ON HOW WE GO FORWARD HERE -- I SHOULD ASSUME ANYTHING BUT WE I DO HAVE YOU SEEN THAT. OKAY ALRIGHT AND WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL SO POINT OBVIOUS THAT'S A STARTING POINT. BUT I WILL TELL YOU I I AM I HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- ABOUT ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN THEIR I THINK ONE OF THEM. IS. A HEARING TODAY HEARING ABOUT WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN SOUNDS LIKE THOSE THOSE ARE PLANS AND ALREADY EXIST OR THERE ARE PLANS OUT THERE FOR AWHILE FOR MITIGATION. BUT WE HAD THE WAY I READ THE PROPOSAL IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT STEPPING UP WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS FOR I'LL USE THE INVESTOR YOU TO IS AND OWNED UTILITIES IN A BIG WAY -- AND THERE'S THERE'S TIMES WHICH IS A TIMEFRAME FOR REVIEWING THOSE THREE MONTHS. BUT NO MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS AND THEN THERE'S IMPLEMENT DUE TO REVIEWS FOR IMPLEMENTATION WAS OR TWELVE MONTHS. NO MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. STILL ON THE SAME PAGE SO MOM I GUESS WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IF THIS PROPOSAL WERE TO GO THROUGH WITH SOME IS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO NEED? TO MAKE THIS GO THROUGH BECAUSE I WILL SAY AND I PASSED AND I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE AND I HAVE A BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT'S A TWEAK TO AN EXISTING PROGRAM. ALMOST OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS NOW WERE WAITING FOR FINAL REGULATIONS ON THAT. SOME OF A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MASSIVE WILD WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS HOW THAT HAPPENS OUT THERE. WHEN WE CAN GET REGULATIONS ON A ON A ON A BILL TO TWEAK AN EXISTING SYSTEM? IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS. SO -- SO. I HAVE A I HAVE THE SAME FRUSTRATIONS I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE WERE DESIGNED TO SLOW THINGS DOWN. WE WERE DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE. BOTH THE POLICY AND ALL THE CHANGES THAT ARE MADE STRAIGHT PEOPLE GET DIFFERENT BITES AT THE APPLE. AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH VERY LARGE. PEOPLE HAVE FOUND THAT THAT IS NECESSARY. SO -- IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU NEED A DIFFERENT STANDARD BY WHICH WE ADOPT CERTAIN KINDS OF POLICIES. THEN PERHAPS YOU NEED TO REALLY KIND OF THINK ABOUT REDESIGNING OUR PROCESSES I WILL SAY THAT ONE OF THE THE FEATURES THERE WERE WERE WRESTLING WITH IS THAT WE CAN DO SOME OF OUR FIVE SAY LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS. THROUGH NOTICING CAR COMMENT PROCESSES THAT'S NEW TO US IN WORD WORD WE'RE CONTINUING TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. EXPEDITIOUSLY HIM FAIRLY. SO IT WOULD RATHER THAN HAVING PEOPLE COME BEFORE A ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. AND PRESENTING A CASE AS TO WHY THEY OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE. HAVING THE PARTY'S COMMENT ON A SCOPING DOCUMENT AND NOT HAVING THE SCOPING DOCUMENT REPUBLISHED IS IN ORDER. THEN HAVING AND PEOPLE SUBMIT BRIEFS THEN HAVING PEOPLE ON COMMENT ON EACH OTHER'S PRES THEN HAVING EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS. HAVING CROSS EXAMINATION OF EACH OTHER'S WITNESSES. AND THEN ACTUALLY HAVING A PROPOSED -- DECISION COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED DECISION SOMETIMES REAL LITIGATION SOMETIME BIFURCATING PIECES OF IT WHERE THERE'S NOT A CONSENSUS OR A CLEAR RECORD. YEAH THAT'S SLOW. AND I WANT TO CHANGE IT WELL YOU KNOW I'M. YOU KNOW YEAH I DO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING LET'S TALK A PIECE WE'RE DYING LESS IT SO I'M CONCERNED. HOW LONG IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE DESIGNED TO SLOW THINGS DOWN? HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE? FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD ON SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD HOW LONG IS IT REALISTICALLY TAKE TO REVIEW THESE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO REALISTICALLY TAKE TO DO THE INSPECTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY. BECAUSE I'M REAL CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BASED ON MY MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE WAY THINGS WORK WELL I'D JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT ONE THING WHEN WE DEPART FROM THE LONG STANDING PRACTICE OR PRECEDENT FOR A SET OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. HE GETS LITIGATED WE GET SUED SOMETIMES PUBLIC POLICY ARGUMENT AS TO WHY WE'RE DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE. IT'S HELPFUL TO GET DIRECTION. CHANGE THOSE THINGS. THEN THAT AT LEAST IS ONE OF THE PUBLIC POLICY ELEMENTS THAT WE CAN DEPEND ON WHEN WE GET SUED. SO I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU THAT IT'S IF THAT IS THE DIRECTION THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS FOR US TO GO. YOU SHOULD. TELL US WHERE AND WHEN WE SHOULD USE THOSE OF THOSE NEW -- KINDS OF AUTHORITIES WHEN TO EXPEDITE PROCESSES WINTER ACTUALLY GO. IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS WHAT -- WHAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN SUGGESTED WHICH IS THAT MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER VENUES WHERE THESE THINGS ARE DECIDED AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY AND THAT IT'S UP TO US TO IMPLEMENT. STILL WILL TAKE SOME TIME BECAUSE IT MEANS TO IMPLEMENT THINGS YOU GOTTA HAVE PEOPLE IF IT'S NEW. HE GOT TO HAVE THEM TRAINED YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE STEPS. BUT I THINK THAT THAT. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S A LONG TEDIOUS PROCESS ALL I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT THAT'S THE WAY WE WORK DESIGN. THAT WAS PURPOSEFUL. YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT JACK. I'M JUST CONCERNED I DON'T WANNA BE HERE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WHEN? MILLIONS OF MORE ACRES MAYBE OF BURNING CALIFORNIA AND MANY MANY MORE LIVES OF LOS WONDERING WHAT THE HECK ARE WE DOING SO I PROJECT MY PASSION BUT NO I LIVE THIS IS MY DISTRICT GASES WERE FORTY FOUR PEOPLE. FORTY FOR MY CONSTITUENTS DIE. AND I'M I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYMORE DOT WEIRD I WATCHED FOR FOUR YEARS -- LITIGANTS PARTIES IN OUR PROCEEDINGS ARGUING ABOUT WHAT IS THE PROPER LIFE SPAN OF WOODEN POLES IT FORTY YEARS SERVICES SEVENTY YEARS WHETHER THE CRITERIA USED TO TO TO EVALUATE WHETHER WHERE UNDER UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD EVALUATE IT DIFFERENTLY. THAT SEEMS LIKE COULD BE A SIMPLE QUESTION. BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU THEIR WORK PANEL LIKE THE TAX COURTS WERE KINDA LIKE -- THE ADMIRALTY COURTS WERE KINDA LIKE THE PATENT COURTS AND I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THE ADMIRALTY COURTS ARE STILL LITIGATING WHETHER THE SPANISH ADMIRAL MADE A MISTAKE GOING TO THE WEST SIDE OF SCOTLAND AFTER HE GOT. BEAT BY THE BY DRAKE AND AND ENGLISH CHANNEL. SO THOSE THINGS. YOU MAY WANT NOT WANT TO KIND OF JUDICIAL BODY THAT WE WE WE FORM BUT IN OTHER CASES THERE SEEMS TO BE A PREFERENCE TO HAVE US PARTICULAR IN THINKS INVOLVED EXPENDITURES OF MONEY. DO WE HAVE STANDARDS ON POLLS. WE HAVE STANDARDS ON POLLS BUT THE HOW DO YOU BEGIN TO APPLY THEM WITH FOR ME AND PULLS DO YOU DO IT ON A HIGH EVERY SIX MONTHS BASIS DO YOU DO IT ON A FIVE YEAR BASIS DO IT ON A TEN YEAR BASIS IN INVASIVE INSPECTION. USUALLY DONE EVERY FIVE TO TEN YEARS DEPENDING UPON WHERE THE LOCATION. BUT POLLS TEND TO BE FAIRLY LONG LYFT OBJECTS I REMEMBER THAT A PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY IN THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES TEND TO ARGUE THAT THEY ARE NOT UNDER OURS ARE SUPERVISION. WHERE THE GENERAL MANAGER OF LADWP SAID THAT POLL IS BENT BECAUSE IT? WAS PROLLY FIRST PLACED IN THAT LOCATION WITH THOMAS EDISON WALKED THE FACE OF YOUR SO DO WE ABANDON THE VALUE OF A POLL THAT STILL IS FUNCTIONAL. WHERE DO WE DO WE TRY TO FOCUS ON THE ONES THAT TRULY NEED REPLACE? I TEND TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF SAFETY BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THERE'S AGREEMENT. YES AND AND AT A CHRISTIAN AND I UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT THERE APPRECIATE THAT. DO WE HAVE NGUYEN STANDARDS ON POLLS. WE DO THEY'RE VERY COMPLICATED AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE MADE TWENTY YEARS AGO THIRTY YEARS AGO STAND UP TO THE KINDS OF CONDITIONS THAT WE SAW IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I CAN A LITTLE LEASE OF ATTIC. TO GO INTO MUCH DEEPER BUT BASICALLY LOOK AT ALL THE EQUIPMENT CLEANING TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT THAT'S INSTALLED ON HE SAID. MORE -- EQUIPMENTS ATTACHABLE CAN ACT LIKE A SAIL WORK MORE WIRES THAT PUT ON THAT PEOPLE CAN ACT LIKE A SALE. IT CAN RESULT IN BREAKAGE OVERTOPPING. AND I WILL SAY THAT IN SOME CASES WE KNOW. THAT SOME FIRES RESULT IS IS. FROM INAPPROPRIATE WERE POORLY TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE ON A WOODEN POLE. WE GENERALLY HOLD ELECTROCUTED FOR MANAGING THAT BUT AS I SAID. SOMETIMES THEY DO THE RIGHT THING. IN THESE OTHER UTILITIES DON'T FOLLOW UP IN A TIMELY FASHION I'VE SEEN BUDDY PULLS THOSE POLLS WHERE THE ELECTRIC UTILITY REPLACES THE PAUL. BUT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOW UP ON THE SAME DAY THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP TWO WEEKS LATER. SEE HITS HITS SOMETIMES TWO YEARS LATER BEFORE YOU FINALLY START TO SEE THE TELECOM PROVIDER SH CHAU WHAT. TO DO ALL OF THEIR WARES SOMETIMES. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE FROM [inaudible] HOLD [inaudible] PHONE SERVICE. OLD CABLE SERVICE NEW PHONE COMPANY SERVICE THAT'S BOTH INTERNET CONTENT AND THE TELEPHONE. AND THEN CABLE COMPANY. ALL MORE WHERE YOU SEE SOME OF THE WIRES HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED BUT NOT ALL OF SO. THE UTILITY CAN CONSUME. BUT THEY CAN'T. WE CAN'T UNILATERALLY MOVE OTHER PEOPLE'S EQUIPMENT. IF YOU AND I AND DESPITE MY FINAL QUESTION IS ON CHEAT IN THIS TO CHEAP OR FIRST WELL I THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU OR YOUR STAFF HAS DONE. THROUGHOUT THE FIRES I SPENT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME WITH CAL FIRE PERSONNEL. OVER THE OVER IN OCTOBER AND SUBSEQUENTLY I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU GUYS DO. THERE MAY SEEM CREWS ON THE GROUND AND ALL THE MUTUAL AID EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SO THANK YOU I KNOW YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A LOT. YOU NEVER EVEN GOT A BREAK MEANS THE FIRE SEASON IS CONTINUED ON CONSTANTLY SINCE -- SINCE LAST YEAR AND AND I SO -- DO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF AN ESTIMATE ON WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GET THE REPORT ON THE TABS FIRE LIKE I SAID IN MY OPENING COMMENTS I FEEL LIKE WE'RE OPERATING. WITH A FEW CARDS MISSING FROM THE DECK AND I THINK IT'S I THINK IT. I'M NOT AYE I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE'S INFORMATION THAT WE WON'T BE CONSIDERING HERE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS IT THAT IT REPORT IS A FORTHCOMING FAIRLY SOON. WELL THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION -- YEAH WE WE DO HAVE A OF OF THE TWENTY SEVEN PLUS FIRES THAT OCCURRED IN OCTOBER DURING THAT FIRE SIEGE -- MEMBER -- WOULD WE WE DEFINITELY HAVE -- COME TO CONCLUSION ON MOST OF THEM. AND I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN OF THOSE HAVE BEEN REFERRED -- TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS FOR DETERMINATION ON ON MOVING THEM FORWARD. THEN THAT LEGAL SO -- AND THEN THERE ARE TWO THAT ARE SET OUTSTANDING OF WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS THE TUBS. AND OF THE TUBS IS A VERY DIFFICULT -- SITUATION -- WE COME ACROSS THEM ON OCCASION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT THE THOMAS FIRE IS BEING IS IS PROVING TO BE DIFFICULT AS WELL EVEN THOUGH THAT'S THAT'S IN -- THE THE COUNTY OF VENTURA US JURISDICTION -- THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT NAILING DOWN THE ACT EXACT BECAUSE CAN BE VERY TEDIOUS AND SO. WITH REGARD TO THE TUBS WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE EVIDENCE METHODICALLY. AND WE'RE TESTING AND RETESTING THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE. A SOME OF THAT'S OUT FOR THIRD PARTY WE CURRENTLY AND I DON'T HAVE FOR YOU -- WHAT YOU WANT IT BEING THAT DATE OR A TIME FRAME THAT THAT -- REPORT WILL BE [inaudible] THE COMPLETE -- WE ARE WORKING METHODICALLY AND VERY DILIGENTLY TO GET THAT DONE TRICKS [inaudible] THANK YOU. AB MISTER DOUGLAS DO YOU KNOW. WE IS DESCRIBED IT THE AID PROGRAM IN SAN DIEGO THAT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE. WHAT WAS THE NECESSARY INVESTMENT TO GET YOU TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW? WELL WHEN WE LOOK HOLISTICALLY THROUGH OUR AND THROUGH THE TECHNOLOGY. THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS -- VAST ENGINEERING. PROJECTS -- AND EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER OUTREACH ITS BEEN OVER A BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT -- ALREADY -- OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO IS. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IN SAN DIEGO SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE STATEWIDE? IT WOULD THERE'S VERY DIFFERENT TOPOGRAPHIES AND I'D DIFFERENT FACTORS -- IS THAT WOULD BE APPLIED STATEWIDE SO WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN REGION BY REGION TO TO LOOK AT ITS APPLICABILITY. ON IN DIFFERENT AREAS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE. THE RESULTS IN SAN DIEGO -- YES I FEEL THAT THROUGH THE COLLABORATION THROUGH THE TECHNOLOGY AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AT MITIGATING -- OUR FIRE RISK. SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND BE LOOKED AT FOR THE REST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] YES [inaudible] THANK YOU -- YOU STARTED TO TALK IN RESPONSE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS QUESTION OR ONE OF THE IN ONE OF THE ARTICLES FROM LA TIMES. VERY FIRST SENTENCE READS DOWNED POWER LINES AND SPARKING ELECTRIC. ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT IGNITED MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S RECENT DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. WHAT IS THE METHODOLOGY WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE CAUSE OF A FIRE ONE OF THE FACTORS YOU CONSIDERED? REYES -- WHILE I AM NOT A CERTIFIED INVESTIGATOR OF SUCH -- WHAT WE DO IS WE IDENTIFY INDICATORS -- INITIALLY OF AFTER A FIRE BURNS CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS HAPPEN TO DIFFERENT PLANETS AND DIFFERENT -- ELEMENTS THAT ARE BURNED YOU CAN IDENTIFY AND DIRECT BACK TO A POINT OF ORIGIN SO WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT POINT OF ORIGIN IS. ONCE WE DETERMINED THAT THEN THE POINT OF ORIGIN IS SEARCHED FOR ANY POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THAT -- AND THAT AND WE WE WEEK IT'S A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION -- WE DETERMINE WHAT WAS NOT THE CAUSE -- CHECK THOSE BOXES OFF UNTIL WE GET -- TO HANDFUL OR A POSSIBLE SINGLE. THIS IS WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE -- IF THERE'S A DEVICE IN THERE IN THE CASE OF AN ARSON -- THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED OUT WOULD BE -- BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE CAN'T FIND THE CAR SOMETIME ME SO -- IT'S A ROADSIDE [inaudible] ACTUAL. BECAUSE THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY. IT'S CLEAR THEM THAT IT IS A VERY DETAILED PROCESS WHEN YOU FIND. OR WHEN YOU PUBLICLY STATE. THAT AN ENTITY OR IT ARSONIST HAS CAUSED THE FIRE. YOU'VE GONE THROUGH QUITE A PROCEDURE BEFORE YOU HAVE COME TO THAT CONCLUSION. THAT IS CORRECT [inaudible] THANK YOU. IT IN THANK YOU IT. AT THAT WITH PEARCY -- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE. THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS YOU OF YOUR PLANS. HOW OFTEN ARE THOSE VIOLATED BY THE UTILITIES -- SO WE HAVE EXTENSIVE -- REQUIREMENTS FOR OVERHEAD AND ON THE GROUND. ELECTRIC EQUIPMENTS. AND WE CONDUCT AUDIT AND INCIDENTS INVESTIGATIONS -- THE FREQUENCY IS. HOME. IT REALLY RANGES EL IN TERMS ALL OF THEM. KHOMEINI EL VIOLATIONS WERE POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS THERE ARE. NO. THEY ALSO RANGE IN THERE WELL SEVERITY AND IMPACTS SO ON SAFETY CERTAIN EXAMPLE OF THAT I'D IS EVERY WELL PULL IS REQUIRED TO HAVE A HIGH VOLTAGE SIGN. ALL ON ITS OWN THE FREQUENTLY FALL OFF PEOPLE SOMETIMES LIKE TO USE THEM AS TARGET PRACTICE ALL KINDS OF THINGS. SO IT CAN BE TECHNICALLY A VIOLATION BUT IT'S A MISSILE IN HIGH VOLTAGE SIGN IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO FOR EXAMPLE SPARKED A FIRE. SO IT'S THE DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER IN TERMS OF L. FREQUENCY. HOME BUT IT'S THOUGH WE HAVE THE EL. IN THE EXTENT SO -- PROGRAM TO LOOK FOR WELL VIOLATIONS OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS AND ENSURE. THAT UTILITIES CORRECT THE HOME AND IN CASES WHEN THEY DO NOT THAT WE SEEK UP ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS THE STRAIN THEM THE EFFECTIVENESS? OF YOUR CURRENT STANDARDS. IF IF YOU SAY HERE'S A PLAN THEN HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IT ISN'T DONE. GIVE THEM FIND THE UTILITIES BUT HOW EFFECTIVE IS THAT. YEAH HER HISTORY IS AS ECONOMIC REGULATOR AND SO WHEN WHEN WE GET TO SAFETY WE FREQUENTLY USE THE SAME KINDS OF TOOLS SO WE'LL DO AUDITS. AND THEN WE'LL DO SPOT CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT THE UTILITY HAS IN PLACE IN THE REPORTS THEY HAVE ON THEIR THEIR ACTIVITIES ACTUALLY MATCH UP. TO TO WHAT WE SEE WHEN WE GO OUT AND DO THOSE THE SPOT CHECKS. WHO FREE CALL WE DO THAT BASED ON -- THE THE KIND OF A INDUSTRY RAIL IS IT WE WERE REQUIRED BY LAW TO DO A MUCH DIFFERENT KIND OF INSPECTION PROCESS AND WE DO WITH FOUR MILLION POLLS. SO FRANKLY I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO DO START TO RELY AND TECHNOLOGY. SO OUR REALIST BACKERS FOR EXAMPLE GO OUT EVERY YEAR HE LOOK AT EVERY FOOT OF TRACK AND THE CARRY LITTLE MIRROR SO THEY CAN LOOK AT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRACK TO SEE IF THERE ARE CRACKS. ARE DE FEDERAL RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION HAS A HIGH TECH LOCOMOTIVES THEY CAN ACTUALLY ROLL THAT SAME TRACK. DUE TO THREE TIMES A YEAR AND TAKES IMAGING. SOPHISTICATED ELECTRO -- MAGNETIC IMAGING THAT CAN DETECT THE CRACKS IN THE LOGO I DO THIS INSPECTION. I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO REALLY MONITORING THESE BROTHERS WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE DRONES WITH WHITE ARE. THE GENIE IS CURRENTLY USING TO ACTUALLY MANAGE SOME OF THEIR VEGETATION. AND THEN PATTERN RECOGNITION SOFTWARE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE EQUIPMENT SIGN THAT PULL AND THEY RELATE IT BACK TO THAT DATABASE FOR TRYING TO BILL TO UNDERSTAND. WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE AND IF SOMETHING SHOWS UP THAT'S NOT THERE IN THE DATE PATTERN RECOGNITION SOFTWARE -- DOESN'T RECOGNIZE. BUT THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR STATE GOVERNMENT -- TO ACTUALLY USE TECHNOLOGY ON THAT LEVEL AND PARTICULARLY TO START DE TO GET TO THAT HIGH LEVEL OF ALMOST ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO DO THE RECOGNITION OF BOTH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT'S ON IT. AND VEGETATION. BUT I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION THEY WERE HEADED. IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU FEEL WOULD BE HELPFUL HOUSE THAT PROPOSAL BEEN MADE. JUST FORCED BUDGET AS SOON AS I SAW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I THOUGHT THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO GO. BUT I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE A BUILDING PROCESS. THIS YOU WELL KNOW. AGENCIES DON'T GET TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ARE ON THEIR OWN THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH CAL I. T.. TO ACTUALLY GET PERMISSION TO DEVELOP THINKS I HAVE A NAP ON MY PHONE THAT WE THAT WE DEVELOPED. AT CPUC SO PEOPLE COULD TAKE A PICTURE. OF A POLL VIOLATION AND WOOD AUTOMATICALLY UPLOAD -- TO TO THE CPUC. BUT WE CANNOT GET. KIND OF DATABASE AND THE SERVERS THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY MANAGE THOSE THINGS AND BEGIN TO TURN IT INTO AN ENFORCEMENT TOOL. BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW FOR SURE THAT THERE ARE MANY. REQUIREMENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN IN MANY PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WHERE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLIED WITH WE ALREADY KNOW THAT. CORRECT. AND THAT THE UTILITIES ALREADY BEEN FINED. AND EVEN AFTER THEY'RE FINE THEY'RE STILL NOT CORRECTING IT IS THAT STILL HAPPENING. WE GENERALLY OF A MIDDLE DEFERRED TO TO TO KNOW HE'S VERY WE DO NOTICES OF VIOLATION WE DON'T HAVE THAT CITATION AUTHORITY FOR THE TELCO COMPANIES HOWEVER SO IT REALLY IS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. KIND OF A PROCESS SO WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP -- THE THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY GET THE OTHER UTILITIES UNDER COMPLIANCE. BUT I THINK THERE WILL WE FIND OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ISSUE WE REQUIRE CORRECTION. AND IF THERE ISN'T SPEEDY CORRECTION WE TRIED ESCALATED TO CITATION. CITATION IF WE FIND A PATTERN THEN WE MOVE IT TO AN INVESTIGATION. BUT LIKE A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT. DO YOU ACT WHEN LIGHTNING STRIKES. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY. POLICE DEPARTMENT KNOWS EVERY DRUG TRANSACTION WAS TAKING PLACE. SOMETIMES IN THE CATCH PEOPLE IN THE LIVE. SO I'M JUST SAYING THAT WITH FOUR MILLION POLES MILLIONS OF MILES. OF PHONE. FILE WIRES AND AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF TREES WHO. THE THE EXPENDITURE AND THE AMOUNT OF OF HUMAN LABOR THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO DO THAT IS EXTREME. P. GENIE FOR EXAMPLE HAS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THE PGA THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS ELEVEN TWELVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES RIGHT ABOUT NOW. AND THAT'S SPLIT ACROSS A WHOLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO TO ACTUALLY MATCH THAT KIND OF INSPECTION CAPABILITY. WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR US SO IN THE MEANTIME WE DEPEND ON AUDITS. OR EVEN IN YOUR AUDIT SO YOU'RE FINDING THAT THE COMPLIANCE IS NOT THERE. IS THAT CORRECT DO YOU GENERALLY DON'T FIND COMPLIANCE IN ANY PROGRAM TO BE PERFECT. AND SO WHAT YOU NEED NOT NOT. EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING SORRY I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT PERFECTION I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT RESPONSE JUST SO WE ARE ESCALATING AT OWN FORCED NOBODY. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY. WOULD REQUIRE PERFECTION BUT I THINK THAT HAVING A RESPONSE IT IF SOMEONE IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE AND YOU YOU THEN. ARE GOING TO FIND THEM GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL NOW INCREASES THE PENALTIES SUBSTANTIALLY. AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE IF THE PENALTIES THAT DO YOU OR HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO A CELLS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO GET THE CORRECTIVE ACTION. THAT PERHAPS YOU NEED MORE OF A PENALTY IS THAT GOING TO BE OF HELP TO YOU. I THINK IT WILL. I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE IN GAS -- PIPELINE MANAGEMENT THERE ARE ARE ARE PENALTIES ARE UNDER WHAT THEY EXPECT THEM TO BE. BUT THOSE LEVELS ARE SET BY THE LEGISLATURE SO WE'VE ACTUALLY ASKED ABOUT RAISING THOSE A NUMBER OF TIMES. I SUSPECT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF OPPOSITION TO INCREASING THE PENALTIES BECAUSE WE WOULD APPLY THOSE THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES AS WELL SO THE ELECTRICAL COME. I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF THERE ISN'T DUH CONCERN ON THE PART OF THESE OTHER UTILITIES. OKAY SAID THEY IT'S TO ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THE TELCOS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN WILL FAILURES. AND THEN MY LAST. QUESTION MORE MORE SO COMMENT. WHEN -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD WAS ASKING ABOUT THE PROCEDURE AND EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND STILL. NOTHING HAS HAPPENED IT. I REALIZE THAT THE YOUR COMMENT YOUR RESPONSE WAS THE LEGISLATURE'S ONE SETS THE STANDARD. IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH SOMETHING. WE WOULD LOOK TO YOU TO TELL US WHAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED. OR CHANGED SO SOMETHING IS HOLDING UP THE PROCESS WERE EXPECTING IT TO BE. TO TAKE WILL WHO RUN ITS COURSE AND COME UP WITH EVERITT DOES SOLUTION AT THE END IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS CAUSING A PROBLEM OR CAUSING. THE PROCESS TO SLOW. THIS DOESN'T EVEN SOUND LIKE IT'S SLOWING DOWN SOUNDS LIKE IT'S ALMOST STOPPED. I DON'T I TRULY I WOULD ABSOLUTELY I DID I WOULD PERSONALLY SAY WE WOULD ALL I WOULD WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED SO THAT WE CAN THEN LOOK TO SEE. WHAT WE DO TO HELP YOU DO THE JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THE P. YOU SEE? ABSOLUTELY WE RAISED A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND REFORM BILLS OF SEVERAL YEARS AGO. SENATOR HILL ACTUALLY -- RESPONDED ON ON ONE OF THOSE ISSUES AND GAVE US A A PROCESS TO BEGIN IN LINE ON ONE OF OUR THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS. SO WE'RE TRYING TO TO PERFECT THE I DON'T KNOW LAW WHICH THAT WOULD INCLUDE WHAT CATEGORY THIS SPECIFIC -- ON TWEAK THE YOU WANTED TO MAKE FELL. BUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE. A SETTING WHERE EVERYBODY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOICE AND EQUAL VOICE BEFORE A DECISION MAKER. DEMOCRACY IS THE GOAL OF DEMOCRACY HAS NEVER BEEN EFFICIENCY AND SPEED. BUT DEMOCRACY ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE COME TO A SOLUTION AND IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO COME TO A SOLUTION THE WE HAVE TO FIX. A PROCESS WHICH STILL HAVE DEMOCRACY AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT BUT IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE PROCESS WE'VE GOT TO FIX THE PROCESS SO WE ACTUALLY DO. GET DEMOCRACY WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE TO GO OVER SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT REJECTED BY IN THE LEGISLATURE LAST TIME AROUND I LOOK FORWARD. TO SO THERE WERE SOME. THANK YOU EN. I JUST WANNA THANK ALL ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL SO SPOKE TODAY AND IN AND RAISE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS I THINK THAT I THINK FOR THE NEXT STEP. YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO SEE US FOCUS ON WHAT WHAT WHAT THIS COMMITTEE INTENDS TO WORK ON AND REALLY BRING THOSE SOLUTIONS THE FOREFRONT HAVE THOSE BE DISCUSSED BECAUSE I MEAN. WEEK THAT AS AS MISTER WAR A MINIATURE AND THE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO THESE FIRE WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN GO VERY FAR INTO LAND USE. INTO WHERE WE BILL HOW WE BUILD WHAT CODES. ABOUT REQUIRE OF PEOPLE IN CONSTRUCTION AND WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THE UTILITIES IN TERMS OF WHAT POLLS WERE GOING TO USE WHAT KIND OF POWER WE'RE GONNA. SITE AND WHAT LOCATIONS WHERE WE WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO BE CONNECTED TO UTILITIES YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE. IN A VERY HIGH FAT FIRE HAZARD AREA WILL. WILL WE EVEN SHOULD WE EVEN ALLOW PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND IF THEY DO LIVE THERE. SHOULD THEY SHOULD WE HAVE POWER LINES EXTENDING. TO THOSE PARTS OF THE STATE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT. ENGINEERING WISE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS TODAY S. MR PICKER STE NAY STATED. ARE VERY DIFFERENT TODAY THAN THEY WERE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT NECESSITATE. DIFFERENT KIND OF WIRES DIFFERENT KIND POLLS. AND SO SO. I MEAN I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS TODAY I MEAN I I CAN I CAN ASK VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ON ON MANY OF THE DIFFERENT PRESENTATION BUT IN THE END WHAT WHAT WE I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED US LEGISLATURE. MISTER BEGIN THE FOCUS ON THE MOST URGENT. ISSUES I I UNDERSTAND BIOMASS PLANTS. AND HOW THEY CAN BE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF A SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. BUT IT'S NOT THE CHEAPEST WAY TO MANAGE. BRUSH AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD TREES BECAUSE JUST BY THE DROUGHT [inaudible] THAT WAS. THAT'S JUST IN THE SIERRA HIGH FOR US THAT IS THAT DOESN'T COVER THE WILD OAK WOODLAND PROBLEM OR DIE MANAGEMENT AND WE'RE SANDRA MAINLY PINE TREES. THE ONES THAT ARE MOST COMBUSTIBLE [inaudible] GENERALLY. WELL I UNLESS A RELISH VERY COMBUSTIBLE WAS AND BUT THAT'S NOT INCLUDED I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BRUSH OR THE THE THE THE THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE FOREST WHICH IF WE JUST FOCUSED ON THE GROUND FLOOR THAT WOULD BE [inaudible] EXORBITANTLY EXPENSIVE. THAT NEVER MIND THE TREES THAT ARE ARE STANDING AND THEN NEVER MIND. YOU KNOW THE POLLS THE ENGINEERING WISE ARE NOT. BUT WHAT THEY NEED TO BE. TO WITHSTAND WINDS AND FIRES AND EXTREME RAIN EVENTS. SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO PUT A PRICE TAG ON THE WHOLE I MEAN WE CAN TALK ABOUT PROCESS. I WAS ON THE SENDING A CITY COUNCIL AND UP THE COAST COMMISSION AT THE SAME TIME. THE CITY WAS TRYING TO CREATE NEW REGULATIONS FOR BRUSH MANAGEMENT WE WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO GET THESE APPROVED. AND THE COULD NOT CLOSE THE COMMISSION COMMISSION DENIED OUR APPLICATION SO IT TOOK. YEARS FOR US TO ACTUALLY GET. A BRUSH MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE CITY. AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND CENTER WHICH AT FIRST PEOPLE LAUGHED AT IT'S A LAUGHABLE THING YOU CAN SAY WE'RE GONNA USE GOATS. TO MANAGE OUR BRUSHES SENEGAL AND SAN DIEGO IN A CITY LIKE MANY PEOPLE RESPONDED. TO THAT PLANET LAUGHTER BUT ACTUALLY BEEN IT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. AND MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS AT TREATING BRUSH. IN RESIDENTIAL AND OPEN SPACE VERY. AND THEN IT ENDED UP BEING BUT THE COAST COMMISSION DIDN'T LIKE PUTTING. GOATS INSENSITIVE HABITAT. SO I MEAN THERE THERE ARE NO REAL CONSIDERATIONS. THAT -- OREGON -- BRING CONFLICT TO THIS DEBATE IN THE STATE CAN JUST COME AND SAY WE'RE GONNA AVOID. FORGET ABOUT SENSE OF HABITAT WE WERE GONNA IGNORE IT NOW BECAUSE OF FIRES SO DO ANYTHING ANYONE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE JUST I MEAN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. REGULATIONS A PROCESS YOU CAN'T JUST COME IN AND STEP ON CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT [inaudible] SO. HAVING THE LOCALS ENGAGE IN A LOCAL PROGRAM IS VERY EXPECT A VERY IMPORTANT. HAVE BEEN THE MANAGER LOCAL PROGRAMS VERY IMPORTANT AND THEN THE STATE CAN COME IN AND SUPPLANT AND THAT'S WHERE I I THINK THIS THIS HEARING WILL BE VERY HELPFUL GETTING PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN SAY YES. THIS IS WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE THIS IS WHAT WOULD THE STATE I DON'T THINK AND THINK WE'LL FIX EVERY PROBLEM IS IT'LL JUST BE JUST. COST PROHIBITIVE TO COME TO THE CP A SECOND FIX EVERY PROBLEM -- CAL FIRE FIX EVERY PROBLEM. UTILITIES YOU NEED A FIX EVERY PROBLEM. BUT WE CAN ALL. ALL AS A COMMITTEE AND THERE AS A COMMUNITY PROPOSE. THE MOST IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS TO THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS THAT COULD HELP US AT LEAST. YOU KNOW A ADDRESS. A MAKE THESE WILDFIRES LESS DESTRUCTIVE. MAKE THE STATE MORE PREPARED TO RESPONSE IN CASE OF A VERY. CATASTROPHIC EVENT. WHAT DO WE NEED HAVE A PLACE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A FEW BILLS THIS YEAR? THAT I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL. BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT THIS COMMITTEES GONNA HAVE TO GET TOGETHER PRIORITIZE AND SAY THESE ARE GOING TO BE THE ISSUES. THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ON THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT ME WE HAVE. FOR WEEKS TO WORK ON ON ON A MAJOR LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE AND FROM THAT OUT I WAS HOPING THAT WE COULD START TO FOCUS. NOW ON WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE GOING TO BE. AND AND MAYBE EVEN THE CREATE WORKING GROUPS IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAT MAY. SPILL INTO LAND USE -- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION -- AND AND INSURANCE ME WE STATE WE SET A CODE ON SHARON'S. AND THAT ME JUST BECAUSE ARISE. IN WHAT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE WHAT WHAT ONCE YOU SET REQUIREMENT. TO TO USE A CERTAIN METHOD. OR A CERTAIN PRODUCT. THAT IS GOING TO CREATE. OUT OF OUTNUMBER DON'T BE A MARKET ADJUSTMENT AND THAT MAY JUST BE HOW BY CREATING A RULE WE CREATE. AND INCREASED THE RATE PAYERS THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT. BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DO THIS MOST EFFICIENTLY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE THAT RATEPAYERS ARE NOT HARM -- TO OR OR THAT WE LOOK AFTER REPAIRS IN EVERY DECISION WE MAKE BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE MAY HAVE. I AN IMPACT ON RATE FAIRS I JUST COULD. IN TURN ALSO DEVASTATE OUR OUR ECONOMY AND DEVASTATE -- YOU KNOW THE POOR. HIS MILITARY TO THE POOR PEOPLE'S ABILITIES SAYING CALIFORNIA. AND AND HOW. AND HOUSING. WE KNOW WHERE WE CITED THE THE REASON WHY WE'RE HAVING SPRAWLS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT IT'S A FINE OUR URBAN CENTERS WIFE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S JUST POLITICALLY -- YOU KNOW I IT'S NOT POLITICALLY SMART. TO TO GO AGAINST WHAT PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ONE ARKHAM PEOPLE CALIFORNIA DO NOT WANT DENSITY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHY ZONING. HAS NOT CHANGED IF NOT WE HAVE DOWN SO WE'VE GONE FROM. ALLOWING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UNITS OF ZONING DOWN TILL A LESSON THAT'S IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WHICH IS MADE. SO I MEAN THAT EVERYTHING IS RELATED. WHERE EVERYTHING IS RELATED WE CAN'T IGNORE THOSE AREAS BUT I THINK AS THIS COMMITTEE WE NEED TO FOCUS? WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE AND? WE HAVE THE EXPERTS HERE THAT COULD LEND. SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD WORK ON AND AND I THINK WE SHOULD. GET STARTED ON ON ON ON WORKING ON THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ORNAMENT MISTER CHAIRS. THEY'D YOU SENATOR -- POINTS WILL TAKE HIM AND WE ARE. COLLABORATE INSIST TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AN ARCHITECT WITH THE NEXT MEETING WILL LOOK LIKE CAN GET MORE INTO THE ISSUES YOU DESCRIBE [inaudible] CENTER SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRS AND LAW I ALSO A WE ARE NEVER GOING TO HAVE PERFECTION -- IN OUR PROCESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T SEE BEST PRACTICES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO. YOU KNOW OFTEN LEAVES THE THE COUNTRY AND SOMETIMES THE WORLD. A AND A LOT OF INITIATIVES THAT WE WE DEAL WITH -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BY THE END OF THIS FOUR WEEK PROCESS AND WE HAVE. CHANGES IN PLACE THAT WILL BETTER GUARANTEED WERE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT WE HAVE WITNESSED -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AMOUNT TO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS I JUST GET A ATTACKS THAT -- IDYLLWILD IS HAVING EVACUATIONS NOW BECAUSE OF A WILDFIRE IN MY DISTRICT SO -- MY SISTER LIVES IN OREGON THEIR BAND AND WAS JUST TOLD HER HOUSE SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO POTENTIALLY EVACUATE. BECAUSE A FIRE SO -- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR -- FIRST DUH. TO MR PICKLER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO WHAT YOU DO WITH THE NUMBER PLACE THAT YOU HAVE. AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE CERTAINLY YOUR SCHOOL. OF RESPONSIBILITY HAS BECOME. MORE COMPLICATED -- OVERTIME NOT LESS COMPLICATED OVERTIME -- AND YOU SAID ON A A FEW DO ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF PEOPLE COHABITATING INFRASTRUCTURE ON POLLS YOU MENTION TELECOM AS AN EXAMPLE. SO WHEN TELECOM WANTS TO COLLECT KATE ON A HOLE IS THAT THE REVIEW THAT YOU DO OR IS THAT A REVIEW THAT THE UTILITY DOES IT SUBMITS IT TO YOU. TO ENSURE THAT. I ASSUME THERE'S SOME -- GUIDELINES THAT THEY HAVE TO FALL TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE. ATTACH SAFELY THAT THEY DON'T. CAUSE A FIRE HAZARD COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT FOR ME. IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPLEX IN THIS DIFFERENT AROUND THE STATE SO IN SAN DIEGO WHOSE -- GAS ELECTRIC SERVICE AREA THEY PRETTY MUCH MAINTAIN THE PROCESS IN HOUSE -- IN OTHER AREAS BECAUSE OF COMPLAINTS THAT THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES WERE SLOW -- AND REMEMBER PARTICULARLY AFTER DEREGULATION IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND A HUNGER TO SEE NEW TECHNOLOGIES BROUGHT TO TO THEIR CUSTOMERS -- THE THEY'VE SHOPPED IT OUT SO FOR EXAMPLE P. JEANNIE AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ACTION ACTUALLY GAVE UP TO THE WHAT THEY CALL THE COMMUNICATIONS SPACE. TO A TNT AND THEY MANAGE. THERE'S ARE ALSO VEHICLES THERE WE CALL THE POLISH AUTHORITIES WHO HAVE FOR MANY MANY MANY DECADES SORT OF MANAGE THAT PROCESS THEY COLLECT RENTS THEY FREQUENTLY TRACK. WHO'S DOING WHAT BUT THEY DON'T THEIR PRIVATE ASSOCIATIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING A SERVICE. TWO THE POLL. ABOUT 9295% OF ALL THE POLLS ROOM BY THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES. BUT AGAIN. THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT USING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO POPULATION TO RUN THE SERVE. SO WE PROVIDE A GRANT OF SERVICE BECAUSE OF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND. THAT'S DESIGNED TO HELP GET COMMUNITY DON'T HAVE HIGH SPEED OR BROADBAND TO THE HOUSE. AND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE HAS TO GO ON POLLS SO THERE'S COUNTERVAILING PRESSURES HERE. AND DUH AND WHO DEVELOPS A STANDARDS FOR THEM TO DEVELOP A STANDARDS. SO OF THE THE STANDARD O. FOR WELL POOL OF LOOTING AND FOR THE AT THE C. FOR ATTACHMENTS IS THE SAME FOR ELECTRIC AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. AND IT'S WITHIN THE SCENE ó SET OF REGULATIONS THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES ADOPTED [inaudible] OKAY. AND THIS BETTER ASSN. NICE TO MEET YOU ARE YOU TALK ABOUT THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A YEAR INTIMATING THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN CODE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD YOU COMPARE CONTRAST THE TWO JUST CALIFORNIA TAKE IT. A A STEP IN A MUCH BETTER DIRECTION AND YOU SEE AREAS WHERE OUR CALIFORNIA. ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE NEEDS TO BE. RADICALLY IMPROVE. ALONG WITH Z. THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S OVERHEAD FACILITIES SO OF SAFETY REGULATIONS SCHOOL GENERAL WOULD IN NINETY FIVE IT'S THESE THE CPUC STANDARD WHICH PREDATES THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE. I BELIEVE SO. AND A IT IS SPECIFICALLY MORE STRINGENT SOME OR ALL THE AREAS SO THE RELIEF IT'S WILD FIRE SAFETY. HOMELESS VEGETATION CLEARANCE REQUIRE -- AND POLLUTING CALCULATIONS OF THE AREAS SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS EXCEED THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE. WELL WE HAVE SEVERAL EL STUDIES THAT COMPARE OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE TO GENERAL ORDER. NINETY FIVE OH WHEN WE IDENTIFY SOME POTENTIAL AREAS SO WE ARE AT THE DID GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE CAN BE IMPROVED. WELL WE AND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PROPOSED THERE IS -- THERE'S BEEN AN ONGOING WORKING GROUP EL FOR GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE AND WE'VE HAD -- ALSO RULED PROCEEDINGS AT THE COMMISSION WE CONTINUOUSLY AMEND AND UPDATES -- THAT CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO SOLVE MAJOR AMENDMENTS TO IT JUST RECENTLY. WELL ONE OF THEM WAS THE FIRE THROAT MOPS THE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER HELD THE MAPS THEMSELVES HAD ANOTHER -- COMMISSION DECISION. AND THAT WAS ADOPTED SO WHAT MORAL LESS CONCURRENTLY OR HOW THE ELECTRIC CH T.. REQUIREMENTS -- OR DIFFERENCE DEPENDING ON THE FIRE RISKS SO THAT WAS A BIG AMENDMENTS A TO GENERAL ORDER IN NINETY FIVE A TO HELP MAKE IT MORE STRINGENT IN THE AREAS OF HIGH FIRE THREATS LOANS. AND THEN THERE'S THE THERE WAS ANOTHER DECISION RECENTLY THAT GO. NEED THOUGH CHANGES TO GO PORTION OF THAT RULE THAT DEALS WITH SO. HOW FAST THE UTILITIES HAVE TO CORRECT -- POTENTIAL ISSUES DEPENDING ON THEIR OF A SEVERITY OF SIGNIFICANTLY TIGHTENING UP THE TIME LINES AND STRENGTHENING HELL THOSE REQUIREMENTS. TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH ELECTRIC AND SO THE COMMUNICATION COMPANIES ARE INSPECTING THEIR FACILITIES AND AS THEY IDENTIFY ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT PROGRAM. THE TITLE NAM. AND WE CONTINUED TO EVALUATES ALL WERE THOUGH REGULATIONS AGAINST THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE AND LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR BEST PRACTICES WALL IN THE AREA OF WILD FIRE EL PREVENTION THAT'S MOSTLY AUSTRALIA. THAT KNOW THAT WE'RE OF FELT LOOKING UP WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING AS WELL AS CAL FIRE AND THE UTILITIES A SMALL. HOME THEY HAVE THE FACE SIMILAR ISSUES AND SO. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM YOU MENTIONED ALSO THAT A QUARTER OF THE ADDITIONS ARE DUE -- TO VEGETATION COMING CONTACT WITH -- ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ARMY PERCENTAGE -- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE A STAFF WITH THE ENORMOUS GEOGRAPHY THAT STATE CALIFORNIA HAS TO PROACTIVELY ENSURE THE VEGETATION IS. IS KEPT UNDER CONTROL NUMBER ONE TO NUMBER -- TWO ARE WE UTILIZING OUR TECHNOLOGY TO OUR BEST ADVANTAGE AS AN EXAMPLE. AND THE OTHER CORPORATE AREAS OF TO MACULAR VARIETY CAME FROM -- CAL STATE SAN DIEGO OWNS A TWO THOUSAND ACRE ECOLOGICAL RESERVE. THAT IS OBSERVE BY PEOPLE ALL OVER THE PLANET BECAUSE THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF CAMERAS WE KNOW THE COST OF THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS COME DOWN -- WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THINGS THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT WE'D BE ABLE TO SEE AS INEXPENSIVELY AS WE COULD HAS THERE BEEN A THOUGHT OF PUTTING. CAMERAS IN THESE VERY DANGEROUS FIRE PRONE AREAS WHERE INSTEAD OF HIRING PEOPLE WITH HELICOPTERS FLYING. OF PEOPLE TO GO ON THE GROUND WITH JEEPS AND LOOKING AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF MITIGATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WE COULD USE. TECHNOLOGY AS A COST EFFECTIVE ANY MUCH MORE EXPEDIENT WAY OF RECOGNIZING WHEN WE SEE OVER GROWTH THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE FIRES -- SO TO YOUR THE FIRST QUESTION AS TO WHETHER WE HAVE -- THE SUFFICIENT STAFFING O.. WE AS I MENTIONED IT IN MY TESTIMONY WE HAVE INCREASED OUR STAFFING AND WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE SO WAY NOW. WE NEED TO DO FROM THE PC AS WELL POINTS OF VIEW EL THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF AN ISSUE FACES OBVIOUSLY EARTHQUAKE EXTENSIVE. AND SO WE HAVE TO RELY ON UTILITIES TO DO OF THE PATROLLING TO ASSURE THE SAFETY OF THEIR LINES WHICH IS THE RESPONSIBILITY -- IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AN AREA WHERE -- ANYTHING THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY -- FOR USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY OTHER. PROVE HOW WE TACKLE THIS ISSUE. WELL THE CHALLENGES AS I MENTIONED WITH VEGETATION A REALLY OUTSIDE OF CLEARANCES MEAN WE YEAH BUT YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE A TENTH VOIGTS -- CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT NOW -- FOR HIGH VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION LINES BUT YOU CAN KEEP INCREASING OF THOSE LITTLE A LIMIT OF DIMINISHING RETURNS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ANY COULD LOOKED THE STREET BUT IS. A FULL TOLL THIRTY FORTY FOOT AWAY FROM THE ELECTRIC CLIMB IT STILL POSES DE PIECE THE FIRE WELL THREATS. SO UNLESS WE COMPLETELY CLEAR WELL WILL VEGETATION AND THAT THE SCHOOL ENOUGH TO POTENTIALLY FULL OVER YOU KNOW YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE RISK IN THE ONE THAT POINTS WHEN YOU HOW OF WINS. ELM ALL EXCESS OF FIFTY SIXTY AND UP TO NINETY MILES AN HOUR THAT VEGETATION CAN BE EL TROUBLING QUITE FAR SO WHAT WE CAN BE DOING WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES IS DOING MUCH MORE FREQUENT SURVEYING AND COLLECTING NO. DATA FOR ALMOST ALL LIGHT ARE FROM. HOME ADVENT OF THE TYPES OF THE DANCE IMAGING AND THEN USING ADVANCED ANALYTICS TO HELP HIM POINTS SO AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST RISKS IT'S REALLY COMBINING. ALL THE DATA THAT I EAT YOU CAN GET FROM -- TOOK A FROM THE ADVANCED SURVEYING WITH ANALYTICS BECAUSE AS THEY EAT TOO IF YOU HEALTH US SENSORS AND USE DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES. YOUR EVIL WITH TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY BUT CENTRAL VALLEY RISK O. VEGETATION LOOKS AT RISK THAT YOU JUST CANNOT DO WITH THE AT AN ARBORIST WAS VISUALLY LOOKING AT A TREE. SAVING TO GO THERE -- DE IN THE V. SENDS IN THE SPACE IN CAMERAS THAT CAN BE USED SO IT IS SO WOOD HELICOPTERS OR AMOUNTS OF THEM PULLS OF ALL KINDS OF SOLUTIONS. THAT ARE LIMON REACTING HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT THAT TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS INTO TECHNOLOGY WENT WITH COST APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS AND AND CHIEF PORTER. A THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY RECOGNIZE AND PER SITE FIREFIGHTER THAT -- LOST HIS LIFE I APPRECIATE THAT IN YOUR VIEW -- CHIEF WHAT IS THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT AFTER READING OUR FORCE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD TREES THAT ARE KINDLING. FOR OUR FIRE SITUATION HERE IN THE STATE -- CAPACITY IS IS -- THE BIGGEST ISSUE THERE -- SENATOR STONE BOTH CAPACITY IN THE ABILITY -- TO HAVE. CREWS AND EQUIPMENT AND JUST SURE -- HUMAN POWER TO REMOVE THOSE TREES -- BUT ALSO IN THE THE OUTLETS FOR THOSE FOR THE WOOD PRODUCTS THAT COULD COME FROM THOSE THINGS GOOD THOSE THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENTS -- FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY A LOT OF THESE TREES THE VAST MAJORITY ACTUALLY ARE IN THE BACK COUNTRY. AWAY FROM -- ROADS AND AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THEIR REMOVAL -- WHICH HAS -- SOME BENEFIT IN THAT THEY'RE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE NOT A HUMAN HAZARD AN ISSUE -- THERE STILL IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL COST TO THAT. ARE ALL OF THAT STANDING -- CARBON CELLULOSE IS GOING TO FALL AND HAS STARTED TO FALL -- AND THAT WILL BE -- FUEL LOADING PROBLEM FOR US FOR DECADES TO COME WHY UNDER I UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS IT'S JUST NOT GOING IN THERE WITH BULLDOZERS AND A AND REMOVING TREES. BUT I THINK WE NEED A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH IN THE STATE AND MAYBE WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF DEAD TREES THAT ARE CLOSE. TO POPULATION CENTERS SUPPOSEDLY HE A RISK. BECAUSE YOU DON'T IF WE LET THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE OF IT WAY TOO MUCH. WERE RISK OF HAVING A FIRE WHICH IS GOING TO DECIMATE THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES AND THERE WILL BE NO CRATERS LEFT OKAY ISN'T GOING IN THERE AND TRYING -- TO DO WEEKEND TO TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THAT WOULD -- YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO RIGHT NOW THERE'S A FIRE IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT IS VENTURE THAT DID YOU KNOW THAT ARE YOUR FIREFIGHTERS IT -- HAVEN'T RYAN ARE PROBABLY ACTIVELY FLYING THERE IN TRYING TO GET THAT FIRE OUT -- IS IT STILL CALIFORNIA YEARS POLICIES THAT THE FLY BY VISUAL FLIGHT RULES AND WILL ONLY FLY DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS OR DO WE NOW HAVE ADVANCED AIRCRAFT. THE COULD FIGHT FIRES -- THIRD OF THE TIME WHEN FIGHTERS ARE GOING IN SPREADING AND AND HISTORICALLY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT THE THING IN THE AIRPORT AMOUNT. IT'S SO RELATED TO FIXED WING AIRCRAFT -- IT IS VISUAL -- THEY THEY CAN FLY TO A HALF HOUR AFTER SUNSET -- AND THAT'S THAT'S THE END OF IT SO FOR THAT'S THE FIXED WING AND NOW FIXED WING THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT -- FLIGHT PATTERN VICTORY THAT AND WOOD ROTARY WING -- WE DO HAVE ROTARY WING THAT WEEK AND CALL UP BY -- OUR OUR CALL WHEN NEEDED PROGRAM AND SOME OF OUR PARTNER AGENCIES HAVE SHIPS THAT CAN FLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. SO THEY CAN DO WATER DROPPED -- IN THE IN THE IN THE NIGHT TIME. WE DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY TODAY -- BUT THE THE NEW FLEET THAT IS COMING THANKS -- TO THE EFFORTS OF OF ALL OF YOU AND AND HELPING US -- TO REPLACE OUR HELICOPTER FLEET ALL OF THOSE HELICOPTER WILL HAVE THAT CAPABILITY. AND SEVERAL OF THEM WILL BE -- ON AND STAFF TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE IN ORDER TO DO THAT. THAT MISSION IN THAT WILL BE AT EVERY ARE COPIES I SUMA BE REGIONALLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL ALL HAVE THE CAPABILITY -- AND DO IT THE BASES THAT WILL BE ON THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WILL BE REGIONALLY -- DISTRIBUTED THE RATE LIMITING STEP TO HAVING FIXED WING BEING ABLE TO FLY OR NOT FLY AT NIGHT ISN'T BASED ON THE AGE OF ARE FLYING INFRASTRUCTURE OR ARE THERE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT OUT THERE AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. DO FLY AT NIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. THERE ARE NOT -- READILY AVAILABLE -- FIXED WING AIRCRAFT THAT DO FIRE FIGHTING -- LIKE DROPPING ANYTHING OUT OF THE AIR AT NIGHT THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO OKAY SO WOULD WE NEED MORE THE HELICOPTERS WHATEVER WE CAN GET THOSE HELICOPTERS AND THEN LASTLY -- BEST BEDS DENIES THAT RIGHT -- EYES WANT TO SAY -- HOW IMPRESSED I AM WITH THE PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE IMPLEMENTED AT -- IN SAN DIEGO AND ALL QUOTE ROSS PEROT WHEN IT WHEN HE SAID THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH STEALING A GOOD IDEA FROM SOMEBODY ELSE. I THINK WE ALL NEED TO LEARN FROM YOUR VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE AND SAFEGUARDING THE CITIZENS OF OF SAN DIEGO AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. THANK YOU. IF IF I COULD. SENATOR YOU HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS CURRICULA SENSE SO HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BECAUSE I WANT WE'RE GONNA BE ON YOUR BUT FIVE SO. MOST OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED AT SOME COUPLE PHONE OKAY BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE CLOCK WE HAVE ONE MORE PRESENTER YEAH. AND AND THEN WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE. APPLE TIME FOR A QUESTION ANSWERS AND IT IS. CONCEIVABLE I ACTUALLY HAD MORE QUESTIONS AS WELL BUT WILL SUBMIT THOSE TO YOU IN WRITING BUT I'D I WANT HER DO YOU RESIST MEASURE THAT WE CAN. ALL BE BRIEF I DO HAVE SEVERAL OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO AS WELL POSSIBLE. SO I KNOW RUN SHORT ON TIME BUT JUST A COMMENT FIRST TO PRESENT PICKER YOU MENTIONED THAT. IT'S THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S DIRECTING. SAYS THAT WERE DIRECTED A LOT OF THESE THINGS BETWEEN POLLS BUT AS A REGISTERED CIVIL ENGINEER I WOULD NEVER. JUST SAY PUT THAT ON THAT TOLD ME WE SHOULD HAVE SOME ENGINEERING STANDARDS WE SHOULD HAVE ENGINEERS ARE LOOKING AT THESE POLLS. BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S THAT'S SO UNFAIR EXCUSE IF IF THAT'S THE REASON THAT'S HAPPENING WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR FIRST. TWO WE DO DO THAT BUT I'M JUST POINTING OUT THAT THERE ARE FREE CALL THE UNAUTHORIZED ATTACHMENTS THAT TAKE TIME TO CATCH IN THERE'S A THERE'S A SLOW PROCESS FOR THE TELCOS TO ACTUALLY CATCH UP TO THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES WE THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM. I DO THINK THAT. WE SHOULD POINT OUT THE LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY -- ADOPTED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HAVE PREEMPTED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO LIMIT WHAT'S ON POLLS THAT THEY OWN AND OPERATE. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A VERY AGGRESSIVE EFFORT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO ALSO -- PREEMPT STATE LAWS I THINK THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SAFETY STANDARDS BUT I THINK THAT. WHAT I'M TRYING TO DRIVE THAT IS THERE'S A HUNGER FOR MORE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ON THOSE SPORTS THAT NETWORK THAT I DESCRIBED? HAS MORE VALUE. THEN WE SEE. AND WE THINK AND IT'S TIGHTLY CONTESTED SPACE AND THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE COMPETITION CROWDING. AND I UNDERSTAND IT IF A CITY OR ANYBODY DIRECTED ME AS AN ENGINEER TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT SAFE. I WOULD NOT DO IT IF I DID I WOULD BE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE I THINK THE UTILITIES GENERALLY DO THAT ONE OF MY CONCERNS HOWEVER IS THE DESIGN STANDARDS A CONSTANTLY CHANGING WE NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE WINS AS FEROCIOUS AS WE SAW IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS OUTSIDE THE TEST THAT'S A DIFFERENT. ISSUE I UNDERSTAND WITH BUT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. AND THEN SHE PUT I THINK YOU YOU ADDRESS THIS IDENTIFIES OWN NOW BUT ARE THERE THINGS THAT ARE NOT. THAT THERE ARE OTHER BARRIERS THAT ARE EITHER KEEPING US FROM FROM SENDING THE FORCE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS SEEK REQUIREMENTS. THEY'RE MAKING SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE QUICKLY TAKING A LONG TIME OR NOT BEING ABLE TO DO LONG LIKE A SENATOR HUESO WITH WITH THE GOATS. AND THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO THAT SUBJECT -- WHAT WHAT WHAT I WANT TO TIE I WANT TO TIE? YOUR QUESTION -- SENATOR STONE'S QUESTION. AND BOTH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DOLLY AND AND WHAT'S QUESTIONS BACK TOGETHER -- AND ANSWER. THE THAT IS AN ISSUE THERE THERE IS A PROCESS THAT TAKES TIME -- ENVIRONMENTALLY TO CLEAR PROJECTS ON THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. THE THEIR IS -- FEDERAL PROCESS THROUGH NEPA -- THAT THAT TAKES TIME ON THE FEDERAL LANDS -- ALL OF THESE PROCESSES ARE BEING LOOKED AT FOR STREAMLINING AND ENTER INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION ACROSS FEDERAL STATE. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- AGENCIES AND GROUPS -- THROUGH THE THE NEWLY CREATED GOVERNOR'S -- FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK -- THAT WAS BORN OUT OF A BIGGER NEED STATE WHY. THAT WAS IDENTIFIED DURING THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE DAYS OF THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS.% AND SO THOSE EFFORTS ARE GOING TO BE EXPANDING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE REGULATORY. CONCERNS THAT YOU MENTIONED -- AND DAY THE MOVEMENT FORWARD OF OF THAT FOREST HEALTH INITIATIVE STATEWIDE OKAY WOULD LIKE US TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS A COMMITTEE AS WELL FOR LOOKING AT MAYBE SHIFTING SOME OF THE BURDEN TO RATEPAYERS OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WAYS TO EXPEDITE THIS [inaudible] AND THEN. THE ISSUES THAT I UNDERSTAND OCCUR WE'RE TRYING TO FEND THE FOREST IS WHAT DO WE DO WITH THOSE TREES ONCE WE TAKE THEM DOWN. IS BIOMASS ON THEM JUST ASK THE QUESTION ANYBODY CAN ANSWER BUT WOOD IS BIOMASS A IMPORTANT PART OF THAT TOO WILL KNOW INDICATE THAT ON OCCASION EVEN GROUND UP INTO SPREAD BUT THERE ARE SO MANY TREES WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH ALL THIS. ALL ALL THESE TREES WERE TO BE TAKEN DOWN. I'LL ANSWER FROM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CAL FIRE IN. FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE THAT IS BEING LOOKED AT AS ONE OF THE OPTIONS FOR AN OUTLOOK BIOMASS FOR THAT MATERIAL -- TYPICALLY WE LOOK AT A HIERARCHY OF THE THAT THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THE MATERIAL FIRST AND BURNING IT UP OR TURNING IT INTO POWER ARE LOWER ON THAT ON THAT. KIND OF GOOD CONTINUUM. BUT A LOT OF THE MATERIAL THAT'S THE ONLY -- THE ONLY POSSIBLE -- OUTLET FOR IT SO -- I'LL I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT FROM THE FOREST MANAGEMENT TESTABLE ISSUE RESPECTIVELY THAT'S SUFFICIENT THEY CAN THEN LASTLY MISTER D'AGOSTINO. SO. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT AS STATEWIDE. PERSPECTIVE. BUT I JUST HAVE TO IMAGINE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO. AND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO REROUTE POWER TO TO THOSE HOMES REVIEW DE ENERGIZED THEY HAVE NO POWER. AND HOW HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN FROM FROM THE CUSTOMER. WELL WE'VE WE'VE GONE OUT EVEN SENSE THE EVENT IN DECEMBER AND HOWLED TOWN HALL MEETINGS AND ALL OF THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO FIND WAYS THAT WE CAN TRY TO MITIGATE THAT IMPACT. ONE OF THEM THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW IS RESOURCE CENTERS SO PREDETERMINED LOCATIONS AND WE PUT THE ENGINEERING EQUIPMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE THAT WE CAN. HAVE A GENERATOR. TO TRY TO PROVIDE THIS FOR THESE LOCATIONS WE HAVE OTHER DOWNTOWN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT ENGINEERING SWITCHING PLANS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DONE. ON TO TRY TO RE ROUTE AROUND. PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK AREAS AND WE LEARNED A LOT IN DECEMBER ON ABOUT HOW THIS WHOLE -- AND DE ENERGIZE ATION PLANNED CAN PLAY OUT SO WE'RE ADDING ADDITIONAL SWITCHING TO THE SYSTEM ADDING ADDITIONAL WEATHER STATIONS TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE CUSTOMER IMPACT WHEREVER WE CAN SO IT'S A CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION WHERE YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR WE SEE MORE SAN AND AS WE LEARN MORE AND THEN WE FIND ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO TRY TO ADDRESS IT? AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT TO THE CUSTOMERS SO THAT'S HOW WE'RE CONTINUING TO APPROACH THIS MOVING FORWARD APPRECIATE THAT SO BUT WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE FROM THE CUSTOMERS IF THEY LOSE POWER. AYE IT IS BEEN MIXED SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THANK YOU -- AND AND SOME PEOPLE HAS BEEN YOU KNOW WE WE NEED THE POWER TO RUN OUR WELLS WE NEEDED. TO TO RUN OTHER THINGS SO IT IT'S BEEN A VERY MIXED RESPONSE OKAY THEY ARE VERY MUCH I'LL TESTIFY TO THAT EVERY TIME THERE'S A D. INITIALIZATION. THE PHONES LIGHT UP THE CP YOU SEE AND I GET FORTY OR FIFTY EMAILS PERSONALLY -- TASKING ME WITH MAKING SURE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN -- NO ACTUALLY I THINK THERE IS THERE IS THERE IS THIS DUTY TO SERVE WHICH IS STATUTORY BUT I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE BOTH LOVE AND HATE INTEREST. AND WHEN IT'S NOT THERE THEY'RE UPSET WHEN IT IS THERE TO HATE. THE LAST SERIES OF QUESTIONS WILL TURN TO CHAIRMAN DOT TO POST TO THIS PANEL AND THEN WILL INTRODUCE THE NEXT. YEAH BECAUSE THE TIMING ON DISCONNECT CUT WAY BACK IS THAT THIS PANEL AS THAT CREATED MORE QUESTIONS. BUT I THAT WOULD BEEN WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP US -- YOUR THE LONG RUN I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT I GET IT. THIS IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTIONS TO IT -- ARE NOT SO SIMPLE BUT THIS SHOULD BE AUGUSTI NO. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR COMPANY'S ABILITY. TO TRY TO ADAPT TO INVEST I EVEN VESTED A BILLION DOLLARS -- TO DATE THAT INCLUDES TREE TRIMMING AND EVERYTHING YES AND WHO AS WE LOOK AT IT NOW WE'RE REALLY JUST GETTING STARTED I MEAN WHEN WE LOOK HOLISTICALLY AT THIS AFRICA AND THERE'S YOU KNOW HAD ASKED ADDITION. AND THE NEXT ONE IS WHAT -- WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT WOODS IS OR WILL BE IN THE AD CHARGED TO RATEPAYERS? VERSUS THE INVESTORS. THAT'S FOR IMPOSSIBLE OUR INVESTMENT. WHAT WILL REPORT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ON THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK [inaudible] NUMBER -- ONE OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT I SEE ALSO THAT THERE'S BEEN THREE FIRES IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. ON ANY OF THOSE BY THOSE THREE FIRES IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN YOUR SERVICE AREA HAS THERE BEEN A DISTRICT ATTORNEY REFERRAL -- NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF THE WORLD REPORT BACK ON THAT AS WELL. IT ENDED FINALLY -- FOR THE THREE OF YOU WOULD YOU KNOW YOUR PARTNER SHIP IS I THINK SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- TO WHERE WE'RE GOING -- I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THESE -- I IN I THINK MISTER PRESIDENT YOU SAID. YEAH THESE ARE LONG HELD POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ROME WASN'T BE A BIT BUILT OVERNIGHT. I THINK TO SUGGEST ANYTHING MORE THAN WE NEED TO HELD A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA. WOULD BE A CHEAP SHOT I I JUST THINK IT'S IT IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF BUT I I AM A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT. GIVEN SOME OF THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TODAY HOW THAT MAKES LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS FEEL ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE STATE LEVEL HOW THAT MAKES OUR CONSTITUENTS FEEL ABOUT? AYE PROTECTING THE SAFETY -- OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN MAYBE EVEN -- YA I DON'T KNOW. I A WEEK WILL I'LL I'LL BE ASKING SUBMITTING A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS OF IN THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT HOW THE HELL DO WE EXPECT -- THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES OR I'M NOT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN GENERAL. I TO REACTED TO BE BEHAVING AND BECAUSE THE AUDITS AND SPOT CHECKS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING AGAIN. FOR NOT WORKING. SO WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT SOME OTHER WAY. I'M DOING THAT WITH THAT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND WE WILL BE BACK IN TOUCH. THANK YOU MISTER ARAFAT AND WE THANK ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US I THINK IT IS VERY. CLEAR THAT THISIS A COMPLICATED SET OF ISSUES AND AS WE OPENED ONE DOOR. THAT LEADS TO MANY MORE AND SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND SOMETIME AMONGST OURSELVES. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN NARROW THIS DOWN WITH ONLY BY THE TIME WE GET BACK IN AUGUST SIXTEEN WORKING DAYS TO TRY. TO COME TO SOME CONCLUSION NOT ONLY ON THIS ISSUE BLOOM MULTITUDE OF OTHERS. AND AND SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT -- WE KEEP YOUR OF ALL YOUR MEMBERS ON SPEED SPEED DIAL AND THEN WILL REACH BACK OUT TO YOU IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND I'M SURE WE WILL. BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I'LL TURN THE MEETING BACK OVER TO TURN INTO OKAY UP BRYAN BROWN MANAGING PRINCIPAL ANALYST FOR RESOURCES ENVIRONMENT INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE [inaudible] ANALYSTS -- IT'S GONNA DISCUSS RECENT FISCAL POLICY ACTIONS ON WHILE BY RESPONSE RECOVERY -- MISTER BROWN I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG YOU WERE -- PRESENTATION IS BUT IT I THINK YOU GET THE WE'RE COMING. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS -- NO THIS WILL BE A VERY OF REPRESENTATION AND SENSITIVE TO YOUR TIME -- AGAIN BRIAN BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE WILL JUST HAVE TO PROVIDE A REALLY BRIEF OVERVIEW ON RECENT SPENDING ON WILDFIRE RELATED ACTIVITIES -- IN SO WE HAVE A HANDOUT CAN DISTRIBUTE NOW BY THE BY THE SERGEANT. IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AND BELIEVE WILL BE POSTED ON THAT COMMITTEE WEBSITE AS WELL -- BUT THIS IS REALLY JUST MEANT TO GIVE YOU KIND OF THE HIGH LEVEL CONTACT THE FISCAL CONTEXT IF YOU CONTINUE TO DEBATE THE VERY SIGNIFICANT COMPLEX. POLICY QUESTION. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF TO HAND OUT THIS JUST SUMMARIZES. BEASTIE RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE TWO MAJOR SET THE FIRES IN SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND FALL OF LAST YEAR WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT IN TOTAL THE TWO YEAR -- OVER SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND OVER TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN COST THIS IS. THE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY RELATED COSTS SO IT PRIMARILY COVERS THE INITIAL RESPONSE ACTIVITIES BY FIREFIGHTERS AS WELL AS THE BREA REMOVAL. AND THEN -- IN ADDITION AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH -- REPAIRING OR REPLACING DAMAGED INFRASTRUCTURE. NOW MUCH OF THAT. COST IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE REIMBURSED PRIMARILY BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THAT STILL LEAVES ON NET GENERAL FUND COSTS IN THE RANGE OF THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED. YOU CAN SEE THOSE -- THOSE COSTS -- QUESTION THE LEGISLATURE PARTLY IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRES BUT I THINK JUST GIVEN THE HISTORY OF FIRE. IN CALIFORNIA BROADLY AND AND FOCUS IN RECENT YEARS ON FIRE PROTECTION OF PREVENTION AND HEALTHY FORESTS HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL. INVESTMENTS MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGETTHERE'S JUST APPROVED BY YOU LAST MONTH. AND SO WE'VE INCLUDED ON PAGE TWO SUMMARY OF SOME OF THOSE. SPENDING -- THIS TABLE INCLUDES -- DOES INCLUDE A FOUR CATEGORIES THE FIRST CATEGORY IS A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SPENDING. A BUDGET IT RELATED TO THOSE OF FIRE RECOVERY COSTS THAT WERE ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE. INTRIGUED ENOUGH ABOUT A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. OF FOR MOST OF THIS DE IS GOING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. TO COVER AT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE RELATED COSTS -- DAMAGE INFRASTRUCTURE SHARE AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND TO BACKFILL LOST PROPERTY TAXES. IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORCE CARMEN PLAN THIS WAS AN ADMINISTRATION. DOCUMENT RELEASED THIS SPRING THE INTENT OF THE PLAN IS. TO IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH BROADLY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- BOTH TO BE ABLE TO SEQUESTER MORE CARBON AS WELL AS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A WILDFIRE THAT EMIT CARMEN. IN DOING THAT THAT HAS -- CERTAINLY BROADER FORCED HEALTH BENEFITS IN IN FIRE PREVENTION IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF OF THESE ACTIVITIES INTO YOU CAN THROUGH THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO THAT -- THESE PROGRAM WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY CAL FIRE THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND AND THIS YEAR. CONSERVANCY IN PARTICULAR -- IN ADDITION TO PROGRAMS FUNDED AS PART OF THE FOURTH CAR THEM PLAN -- THERE IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING PRIMARILY FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THIS IS THE CAP AND TRADE AUCTION REVENUES HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR OTHER FOREST HEALTH AND HEALTHY FORCE RELATED ACTIVITIES THIS IS AN OFFICE A YEAR ONGOING PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN FUNDED IN IN PRIOR YEARS IT. VARIOUS ANNOUNCES THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE FROM THE GDR F. IS CHANGED OVER TIME BUT BUT INCLUDES A HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES. AND THEN LASTLY THE CATEGORY OF FIRE FIGHTING THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET -- INCLUDES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES PRIMARILY FOR CAL FIRE BUT ALSO SOME OF THESE RESOURCES ARE FOR LOCAL -- FIREFIGHTING AGENCIES TO IMPROVE BOND TWO WILDFIRES SO THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE HELICOPTER REPLACEMENT FLEET REPLACEMENT FOR CALIFORNIA THAT. FOUR HUNDRED ONE MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR TO REPLACE FOUR OF OUR EIGHTEEN HELICOPTERS WITH NEW. NEW ONE THAT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT'S RULED OUT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THE FULL FLEET REPLACEMENT -- THERE'S ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY FUND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE RESOURCES SET ASIDE FOR RESPONSE ACTIVITIES -- YOU'LL SEE A COUPLE OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR -- AMOUNTS HERE THE THOSE ARE THE AMOUNTS THAT WILL GO TO LOCAL. FIREFIGHTING AGENCIES FOR EQUIPMENT PURCHASES AND IN AND THEIR FLEET -- EXPANSION. AND IN THE LAST FEW ITEMS ON HERE WE'RE GOING TO INDIVIDUALLY BUT THOSE ARE ADDITIONAL -- FUNDING FOR STAFF MEAN A CALIFORNIA TO THAT THEY HAVE MORE STAFF AND ALSO AT THE CONSERVATION CORPS TO THEM MORE HAND CREWS. AVAILABLE -- TO TO RESPOND TO FIRES AND IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THEIR PROGRAM. OVERALL THIS IS -- CLOSE. TO BUDGET THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. AND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF IT IS FROM THE GENERAL FUND MOST OF THE REMAINDER IS EITHER FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THAT I MENTIONED OR FROM S. B. FIVE WHICH WAS A PROPOSITION SIXTY A APPROVED BY VOTERS. IT'S PAST JUNE AWFULLY THAT OF COURSE WILL BE REPAID BY. BY THE GENERAL FUND TO THE GENERAL OBLIGATION -- BUT THAT COMPLETE THEA THE FISCAL SUMMARY. THANK YOU FOR THAT WE HAVE -- QUESTIONS [inaudible] GO AHEAD. SOME OF MY WORK WHAT HER. KNOWLEDGE THANK YOU. IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET THE LIKE MAYBE TEN YEARS OF WHAT WE SPENT ON SUPPRESSION VERSES. WHAT WE DID ON TO MITIGATE THE? IMPACT TO DO -- PREVENTION. YEAH AND IN FACT OF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES JUST -- WORK ON REPORT THOSE RELEASED EARLIER THIS SPRING AND WE HAVE SOME DATA IN THERE I DON'T HAVE IT. OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT FROM MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT WE'VE SPENT OVER THE PAST DECADE PRIOR TO THE GDR OFF BEING UTILIZED FOR THAT FROM THE PREVENTION PURPOSES. ON AVERAGE CALVET WITH SPENDING SOMETHING LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HEON PREVENTION IF YOU'LL REDUCTION TYPE OF ACTIVITIES YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT'S PUMPED UP NOW UNDER THE THE NEW BUDGET -- THIS IT WAS REPRESENTS JUST -- THE SMALL VERY SMALL SHARE OF THE OVERALL CAL FIRE BUDGET WELL MORE THAN 90% OF IT IS ON FIREFIGHTING RELATED ACTIVE BUT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT THAT DETAIL TO IN YOUR IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS OF ABOUT 90% GET SPENT ON SUPPRESSION CURSES ABOUT 10% ON PREVENTION. I THINK IT EVEN HIGHER THAN 90% BUT THE MORE PRECISE NUMBERS THANK YOU. SO MEMORY WOULD. TAKE YOU THAT. APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THAT WAS THAT WAS RELEASED WHERE I WANTED TO GO I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. YEAH GATHERS TO THEIRS TO EARN SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THERE -- FOR THE FORCE CARVE A PLAN OTHER FOR TECHIES AND THAT'S GREAT -- BUT THERE'S ALSO THIS FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. RELATED TO FIRE SUPPRESSION AND AND AND RECENT RESET MAPPING THERE BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHERE SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IS A ONE TIME. INVESTMENT BUT YOU'RE NOT NINE GOING. YEARLY PROGRAMS WERE NOT. MUCH MY UNDERSTANDING RIGHT SO IN FACT IT FOR ITS CARBON PLAN THAT IS FUNDED PRIMARILY BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND WHICH THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO THAT ALL THE TIME THAT WILL COME BACK TO THIS NEXT YEAR FOR THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND IN THE MOOD FOR THE REMAINDER OF FROM S. B. FIVE WHICH AT ONE TIME FINDING GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. ON THERE IS SOME BECAUSE SOME OF THE S. B. FIVE AUTHORITY THAT WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE TO YOU NEXT YEAR BUT THAT'S NOT EXHAUSTED IN THE MAIN PART OF CARBON PLAN BUT THAT IS NOT UNLIMITED. SO FISCALLY IT'S BEEN PRIORITIES BEEN ON FIGHTING FIRES AND NOT. NOT THE SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE HELPING US IN THE LONG RUN. HISTORICALLY AT THE ABSOLUTELY THE PREDOMINANT SHARE OF SPENDING HAS BEEN ON FIRE FIGHTING ACTIVE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. YOU'RE GONNA GET SOME ABOUT QUESTIONS THAT SUBMITTED TO YOUR CAT THAT'S NOTHING EVEN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HELP. FOR YOUR TIME. I MEAN THAT. DO YOU WANT TO DO CLOSE. SO RICHARD OVER -- TO CHAIRMAN HOLDEN. THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT -- WE GET A SENSE OF AND I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A WILD GUESS THAT NOT THAT EVERYONE WHO IS STANDING AGAINST THE WALL IS PREPARED. TO PARTICIPATE PUBLIC COMMENT IS THERE ANYONE WHO'S NOT STANDING WHO WAS GOING TO JOIN IN THAT LINE AT SOME POINT. I JUST TRY. OKAY. ALRIGHT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE TO STAND RIGHT NOW I'M JUST TRYING TO GAUGE -- HOW MUCH TIME WILL WILL ALLOW FOR EACH PERSON TO SPEAK? ARMS.

THE DISCUSSION ON EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS MUTUAL AID AND INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE WE ARE ALARMED HOWEVER THAT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WANT TO SHIFT THE FOCUS TO HOW THEY COULD SPREAD THEIR LIABILITY WHEN THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES. ARE FOUND TO BE THE CAUSES OF CATASTROPHIC FIRES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALREADY ARE FACED WITH SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS FROM THESE WILDFIRES. ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE WIPED OUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS WERE BURNT. LONG TERM IMPACTS ARE YET TO BE DETERMINED. WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO CHANGE THE RULES NOW SEEMINGLY ONLY TO ONE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF UTILITIES.

WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION ISSUE -- WE BELIEVED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CREATE OF REASONABLENESS STANDARD UNDER OUR LIABILITY LAWS WE CANNOT STRIPPER WAY PROPERTY OWNERS CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS BAKER WE DON'T BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO DO IT THANK YOU.

SACCHARINE A STATION I SERVE ON THEIR BOARD OUR COUNTY HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THE LIABILITY LAWS BUT I WILL BE BRINGING IT UP BEFORE THEM -- AT OUR NEXT BOARD MEETING WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT LAWS LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BRINGING MULTIMILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES TO THE TABLE WITH VICTIMS. TO SETTLE FOR DAMAGE WE MUST HAVE THESE LAWS IN PLACE TO BRING PARTIES TO THE TABLE. RATHER THAN BATTLING IN COURT. WE BELIEVE IT'S HIGHLY. INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. DO SUGGEST CHANGES TO THE LIABILITY LAWS WITHOUT FIRST FULLY EXAMINING SAFETY REQUIREMENTS [inaudible] AND STANDARDS EVEN IF CHANGES STARLIGHT BELLY BE LAWS ARE NOT. RETROACTIVE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT ANY CHANGES -- WILL HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON CURRENT AND FUTURE E. VAS AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR COMMUNITIES [inaudible] CLICK [inaudible] THANK YOU. MINI SPAT WITH TURN THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S TIME TODAY WE'VE BEEN REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS AND SOME OF THE HISTORY WE'VE LEARNED DIDN'T SEEM TO BE -- DISCUSSED TODAY. PJ ANY THREATENING BANKRUPTCY IS NOTHING NEW WE'VE HEARD THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN EVERY TIME THEY HAVE TO FACE THE COST OF THEIR OWN. MISMANAGEMENT THEY THREATENED BANKRUPTCY. WILD FIRES ARE NOT NEW THEY MAY BE WORSE BUT OUR STATE'S BEEN DEALING WITH THEM AND MORE IMPORTANTLY CUSTOMERS PAY THE PGA ME. EVERY MONTH. TO TAKE CARE OF THESE PROBLEMS EVERYTIME PEACHY ANY RAISE RATES THEY TELL US WELL THIS IS HOW WE CAN KEEP YOU SAFE AND THIS IS SO -- WE CAN KEEP SERVICE RELIABLE SO THAT'S NOT NEW. THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT THING FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS KNOWN BAILOUT. WHEN CUSTOMERS CANNOT PAY THEIR BILLS? PGA ANY SHOT SOME OF YET HERE WE ARE FACING A SITUATION WHERE PGE NAME MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY ITS OWN LIABILITIES. AND WHAT DO THEY EXPECT THEY EXPECT US TO GIVE THEM A BAILOUT SO NO BAIL OUT ON THEM. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE IT APPEARS. I CHAIR OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A CHANCE TO ADDRESS YOU. MEMOREX FRAZIER PRESIDENT OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE WE DIDN'T INTEND TO SAY. SAFETY THERE WERE SOME REMARKS. RELATED TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SO WE FEEL COMPELLED TO AT LEAST SAY A FEW THINGS AND AND RESPONSE. WE THINK THE FIRST AND FOREMOST RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS GROUP IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GENIE. OF TAKES ITS CUE FROM WHAT'S NUMBER HAS DONE. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE NO FIRES AND THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT A P. GENIE SO FAR THERE ARE PERFECT AVERAGE OF SIXTEEN FOR SIXTEEN WITH TWELVE ROOM RESULTING IN REFERRALS. AND THEIR RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO CALL FOR FINANCIAL RELIEF IN ESSENCE TO ARE YOU THE CLIMATE CHANGE. AS PER IS SO PROFOUND THAT THEY CANNOT PROPERLY ADAPT TO IT MANAGE IT ON THEIR OWN. MEANWHILE INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE'RE STAYING IN COMMUNITIES AND WE HAD. WE HEARD EARLIER THE DISCUSSION ABOUT A UNIQUE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT. OUR INSURANCE RULES ARE NOT ONLY UNIQUE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT UNIQUE IN THE WORLD THERE'S NOTHING LIKE CALIFORNIA. BUT YET WE STAY HERE WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED US MUCH AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. WE'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO USE CLIMATE MODELS IN OUR RATE MAKING PROCESS. BUT YET THE ARGUMENT IS. P. GENIE CAN'T HANDLE THEIR CLIMATE RISKS SO LET'S DUMP THEIR RESTS ON OTHER FOLKS. IT FILTERS OUT TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND WE CAN'T EVEN INCLUDE CLIMATE RISK IN OUR RATES. ON THE ISSUE OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION JUST GOT IF YOU CAN JUST TAKE TEN SECONDS THERE ARE. THREE THERE ARE PRESENTLY THREE LEGAL CHALLENGES ON INVERSE CONDEMNATION PGA ANY HOUSE TO AN EDISON HAS. ONE AND P. JEANNIE AWAITS RESPONSE FROM THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ON THE VERY ISSUE. AND SO INSTEAD OF PURSUING SOME CONSTITUTIONALLY SUSPECT LEGISLATIVE CHANGE TO A JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION. WE ARE YOU THAT THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ALLOW THE COURTS TO CONCLUDE THEIR TASK MAKING. CATHERINE PETTIBONE AMERICAN INSURANCE DISSOCIATION REPRESENTING BOTH PERSONAL LINES AND COMMERCIAL INSURERS -- I'D LIKE TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS AND CERTAINLY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY AND WOOD STEVE YOU MADE VERY GOOD POINTS ABOUT WHERE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING. A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD TREES WE'VE ONLY TAKEN ON A MILLION WE'VE GOT SERIOUS ISSUES ARE INSURERS ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE STATE'S -- INVESTMENT IN GETTING THIS DEBT AGAIN WE THINK THE INVERSE IS PREMATURE WE DON'T HAVE THE FINAL REPORTS AND ALSO TO THE EXTENT WE ARE DISCUSSING INSURANCE WE'D LIKE TO CRACK SOME OF THE MISSTATEMENTS MADE EARLIER BITER THAT BY THE SPEAKER. AND HAVE A PROPER. A HEARING ON INSURANCE I THINK IT. CHAIRMAN -- DIED CHAIRMAN HOLDEN -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK ANDREW AND WE ON BEHALF OF THE PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS. SO SHE ATION -- WE'D LIKE THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE EQUAL TIME TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. A ECHOING THE COMMENTS JUST MADE WE'D LIKE A POLL PANEL TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS WHAT THE COMPOUND FOR SCOOBY TAKE A VERY HOLISTIC VIEW. ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEDGER IF YOU MAKE THIS CHANGE HOW WE DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARY THREE MAY WE DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE DON'T THINK IN FIVE WEEKS YOU CAN REALLY JUDGE [inaudible] THE IMPACT -- INSURERS HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME WE DEPLOYED OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL SO THAT'S A MISNOMER I WANTED TO CORRECT ON BEHALF OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. AND IN FIVE WEEKS YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION WITHIN THE FIVE WEEKS WAS SEVENTY TWO HOURS IN FRANCE MAKE A DECISION AND MAKE A VOTE. AND IS GOING TO HAVE IMPACTS LONG AFTER THIS. AB YOU KNOW MEASURE TWICE CUT ONCE MEASURE. FOURTEEN TIMES BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS CUT. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK JOSEF OF BEHALF OF THE COALITION CALIFORNIA TILDE EMPLOYEES. WE WOULD ASK THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO INCLUDE THREE THINGS IN YOUR FINAL CONFERENCE REPORT. FIRST WE HAVE TO BE SURELY MAKE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN VICTIMS HOLE. TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP THE GENIE OUT OF BANKRUPTCY AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THAT. IS TO ENACT THE SECURITIZATION LANGUAGE -- WHICH ALLOWS SPREADING OUT THE COSTS OVER TIME. THIS IS NOT A BAILOUT WEAKENED. DECIDE LATER HOW MUCH GOES TO RATEPAYERS HOW MUCH BECAUSE THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO BE SURE. THAT P.

THERE ARE MORE THAN THREE MILLION MEMBERS OF AARP IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY ALL OF WHOM ARE RATEPAYERS AND MANY OF WHOM LIVED ON FIXED INCOMES. TODAY IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIVE DEGREES OUTSIDE. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE AIR CONDITIONING IS PRETTY CRITICAL FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.

PRIORITIZING SAFETY AFFORDABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY I'M NOT A UTILITY -- BLANK CHECK AND I THINK TO THAT POINT WE WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU THAT IN THE PROCESS OF CONSIDERING. A WHATEVER REFORM SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE IMPACT RATE PAYERS [inaudible] RESIDENTIAL AGRICULTURAL. IN A DUST ROAD REPAIRS AS WELL ALL OF WITH ALL THESE CLASSES WHICH PAY WELL ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. ARE CURRENTLY IN UTILITY RATES I IN THE CASE OF INDUSTRIAL RATEPAYERS WERE ABOUT 86% ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND 10% ABOVE OUR NEIGHBORING STATES. THAT AFFECTS COMPETITIVENESS THAT AFFECTS THE AFFORDABILITY OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA THAT AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO CREATE. A GOOD PAYING JOBS -- ALSO OCCURRED YOU -- WIN WHEN CONSIDERING OTHER OPTIONS HERE -- REGARDING THAT TWENTY SEVENTEEN LIABILITIES. LOOK AT ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF REVENUE -- OUTSIDE OF THE REPAIRS -- WE BELIEVE THAT WALT REPAIRS -- BENEFITTED OR FROM THE INVESTMENT OR LACK OF INVESTMENT AYE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SYSTEM SHAREHOLDERS BENEFITTED AS WELL THE STATE BENEFITTED AS WELL.

TO THE CONSUMER SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND WITH RATE HERE COSTS. POTENTIALLY GOING UP DRAMATICALLY LOOKING AT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND ALSO LOOKING FORWARD. AND ADDS TO THE COST OF HARDENING THE SYSTEM IN SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE WE HAVE GREAT CONCERNS WITH THAT. ON AS REPAIRS WE KNOW WE BENEFIT FROM SAFE AND RELIABLE SYSTEMS AND WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S A COST WITH THAT. BUT IF THE STATE ALSO BENEFITS FROM A SAFE AND RELIABLE SYSTEM. SHAREHOLDERS ALSO BENEFIT FROM IN A SAFE AND RELIABLE SYSTEM. INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR A SAFE AND RELIABLE SYSTEM SO I'M I WON I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY FOR RAISING THE ISSUE OF OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS THANK YOU SENATOR DODD FOR ASKING THE QUESTION OF WHO PAID FOR THAT BILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENT DOWN IN SAN DIEGO. WHILE THE ANSWER WASN'T SAID TODAY I THAT RATE PAYERS PAID A LOT OF THAT -- SO WOULD CONTINUE I'M TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND ENSURE THAT ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM A SAFE AND RELIABLE SYSTEM HAVE A STAKE IN THE GAME IN PAYING FOR THAT.

HOWEVER WE'D LIKE TO COMMIT ECHO ARE BECAUSE THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT C. SAKON SUPERVISORS BROWN AND I DILLON. REGARDING THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION PROPOSAL WE ALSO QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT AND FEEL IT WOULD HAVE A EXTREME CONSEQUENCES FOR BOTH OF THOSE THAT SUFFER FROM THE WILDFIRES AND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

THESE INVESTMENTS TO GET MADE AFTER THESE CRISES COME FROM RATE PAYERS. WE'RE PAYING FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS AND GOING FORWARD I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LIABILITY RISK IS NOT JUST GETTING REDUCE FOR RATEPAYERS IT'S ALSO GETTING REDUCED. FOR SHAREHOLDERS AND WE WOULD DO A LOT BETTER IF SHAREHOLDERS HAD SOME SKIN IN THE GAME IF THEY WERE PICKING UP THEY'RE GETTING. THE SAME BENEFIT THE RATEPAYERS ARE REDUCED LIABILITY RISK THAT ALSO BE A LOT MORE PRUDENT ABOUT THE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS THEY MAKE.
