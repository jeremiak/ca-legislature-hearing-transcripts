00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.054
DEAD SALMON WE HEARD FROM

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.255

LEADERS AND FISHERMEN THAT THAT

00:15:58.657 --> 00:15:59.491
THAT INTEGRATED WATER

00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:00.959
MANAGEMENT POLICIES WAS

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:02.795
LITERALLY KILLING CALIFORNIA'S

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:05.798
ICONIC SALMON RUNS WE LEARNED

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:07.399
THAT IT WAS POTENTIALLY

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.168
POSSIBLE. THAT WE WOULD LOSE

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:12.338
ALL ENDANGERED WINTER RUN EGGS

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:13.605
THIS SUMMER ON THE SACRAMENTO

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:16.241
RIVER AND THE WORST CASE

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:18.110
SCENARIO HAS PLAYED OUT

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:19.311
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:23.782
MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE 80%

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:24.316
80% OF SALMON EGGS FOR THE

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:27.086
WINTER RUN. WE'RE LIKELY COOKED

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:27.619
TO DEATH ON THE SACRAMENTO

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:31.490
RIVER. AND WE ARE NOW HEARING

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:34.827
THAT ADDITIONAL 18% OF THE

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:37.296
REMAINING 20% JUVENILE SALMON

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.465
PERISHED DUE TO HIGH WATER

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:41.700
TEMPERATURES. THAT MEANS THAT

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:45.070
WE ONLY HAVE 2% SURVIVAL RATE

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:47.005
FOR THE WINTER RUN SALMON ON

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:50.275
THE SACRAMENTO. NOW THIS IS

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.778
WORSE THAN WHAT WE SAW IN TWO

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:56.815
PREVIOUS DEVASTATING YEARS IN

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:59.885
2000143% SURVIVAL RATE IN

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:01.520
2000155% SURVIVAL RATE SO WHAT

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:03.422
DOES THIS MEAN- AND I THINK

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:04.957
WE'RE GONNA HEAR THIS FROM THE

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:06.358

IN PURPLE URCHIN IN DEEP

ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH COAST.

TALK WITH US ABOUT THAT.

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.344
BASICALLY IT'S THE COOLER WATER

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:54.745
TEMPERATURES. I THINK THAT

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:55.713
WE'RE SEEING AND THAT WARM

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.548
WATER BLOB THAT WE HAD. FOR

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:58.916

IN THE YEARS TO COME- CENTER

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:10.895
EIGHT I THINK IT'S STILL A WORK

00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:12.163
IN PROGRESS I THINK. WE'RE

00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:13.998
WE'RE ALL EXCITED BY ANY SIGN

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.433
OF PROGRESS SINCE THERE'S BEEN

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:17.602
SO LITTLE. ON IT REALLY WITHIN

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:19.637
THE LAST YOU KNOW SIX YEARS

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:22.073
PLUS. ARMED WITH THE MARINE

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:24.775
HEAT WAVES AND THAT THAT- CHEN

00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:25.910
BEHRENS SAID REALLY WREAKED

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:27.645
HAVOC ON THE BULL KELP. ON

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:29.614
ESPECIALLY OFF A MENDOCINO AND

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.516
SONOMA COAST. AND SO ON IN THAT

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:36.087
REGARD. YOU KNOW WE KNOW HOW.

00:37:36.153 --> 00:37:37.989
MUCH PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THIS.

00:37:38.055 --> 00:37:39.123
NOT JUST FROM A FINANCIAL

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.957
STANDPOINT BUT JUST FROM A

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:41.959
CULTURAL STANDPOINT IT JUST

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:42.827
IT'S SUCH A HUGE PARTY

00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:44.795
IDENTITY. ON IN IN YOUR

00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:46.130
DISTRICT JUST AS YOU KNOW

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:47.999
BETTER THAN ANYBODY. ELSE SO

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:49.400
THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN WORKING

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.235
WITH. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:52.770
WHETHER IT'S- PURCHASE FISHING

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:56.507
COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS THE- NGOS

00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:58.709
ON TO IT TO REALLY TRY TO SEE

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.645
WHETHER. YOU KNOW RESTORATION

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:02.279
IS GOING TO HELP ACCELERATE

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:05.449
THAT RECOVERY. ON AND SO ON THE

00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:07.184
OTHER ASPECT IS WE HAVE SIX

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:08.386
DIFFERENT STUDIES SOME THE TOP

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:10.788
HELP. RESEARCHERS ON- IT

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:12.390
LITERALLY IN THE COUNTRY. THAT

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.858
ARE WORKING AT WHAT ARE THE

00:38:13.924 --> 00:38:15.092
BEST WAYS TO GO ABOUT

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:17.294
RESTORATION MOVING FORWARD. SO

00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:18.529
YES THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:20.331
COOLER WATERS ON HAS HELPED A

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:22.033
BIT. BUT I THINK IT'S STILL TOO

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:25.736
EARLY TO TELL. ON WHETHER OR

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.371
NOT THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:29.507
SUCCESS. OR WHETHER IT WERE

00:38:29.573 --> 00:38:30.641
GETTING SOME PROMISING

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:32.343
PRELIMINARY SIGNS AT THIS POINT

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.812
AND SO- THAT APARTMENT AND

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:36.480
OBESITY I MEAN WE REALLY ARE

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:37.581
WORKING ON THIS ALMOST DAILY

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:39.850
TOGETHER. ON IT GENERALLY

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:41.686
TRACKING THAT AND TRYING TO

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:47.725
MOVE FORWARD. SO THAT'S THAT'S

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:48.292
PRETTY MUCH WHERE WE'RE AT.

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:48.826
GREAT UPDATE ON- ISSUES OF

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:50.361
COMPANY GONNA GO TO. ALL THE OF.

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:53.064
WIND AND- MOST FOCUS ON THAT-

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.565
HUNDRED MEGAWATT PROJECT AREA

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:57.668
OFF OF THE HUMBLE COAST. AND

00:38:57.735 --> 00:38:59.904
WEAR A BOW ON THE FEDS HAVE

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.138
BEEN FOCUSED IN REGARDS TO THE

00:39:01.205 --> 00:39:02.606
PROJECT AREA I THINK ONE OF THE

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:04.108
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AND I

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.343
KNOW IT'S OUTSIDE THE TERRITORY

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:09.180
BUT RELATED. GETTING THESE-

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:11.115
THESE PROJECTS STOOD UP AND

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:13.250
BUILD IT'S CRITICAL BUT THE

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:14.585
TRANSMISSION LINES IS WHAT

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:15.886
WORLD WE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AT

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:17.521
AS AN UPGRADE. AND I THINK

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:18.756
THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO GO HAND

00:39:18.823 --> 00:39:22.359
IN HAND. DR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:24.028
WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT AT ALL.

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:26.030
ALL AT ALL I WOULD SAY AND IT'S

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:27.131
NOT GOING TO BE A DIRECT ANSWER

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:29.366
BUT YOU KNOW I. I HAVE NOT

00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:30.968
WORKED IN THE STATE FOR A LONG

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:31.936
TIME I'VE BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:33.070
TWO AND A HALF YEAR SINCE I WAS

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:36.474
OF ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU JUST

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.441
HEARD ABOUT THAT WE WORK ON

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:39.143
OBESITY. THE ONE THAT I'VE SEEN

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.112
BE GREATEST COLLABORATION ON IT

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:42.546
AND I REALLY GIVES THE ENERGY

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:43.848

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.018
BEEN OFFSHORE WIND ISSUE. AND

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:48.919
SO WHETHER IT'S THE COASTAL

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.688
COMMISSION OR THE DEPARTMENT OR

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:52.890
THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:54.391
WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING I AM NOT

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:56.527
EXAGGERATING MANY LEAST TWICE A

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.195
WEEK. TALKING ABOUT ALL OF

00:39:58.262 --> 00:39:59.130
THESE VARIOUS DIFFERENT ISSUES

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:01.465
INCLUDING TRANSMISSION. AND SUB

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:03.234
TRANSMISSION OBVIOUSLY IS MUCH

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.770
MORE IN THE PURVIEW. OF THE

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:08.472
ENERGY COMMISSION AND ON IT IS

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:09.273
REALLY WHAT THEIR FOCUS IS ON

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.275
AT THIS POINT. OUR FOCUS AS I

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:13.144
SAID BEFORE IS REALLY TRYING TO

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.179
FILL THOSE DATA GAPS- WHICH ARE

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:17.181
SO EXTENSIVE. I'M TO MAKE SURE

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.183
THAT WHEN WE DO MOVE FORWARD.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.118
WITH OFFSHORE WIND WE DO IT AND

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:22.386
BY FAR THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:23.554
SENSITIVE AND SUSTAINABLE WAY

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:25.356
POSSIBLE. YEAH AND I DON'T

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:27.024
THINK SO I THINK LONG TERM

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:28.425
THAT'S GOING TO BE HAD IN BY

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:29.860
THE WAY YOUR- DOCTOR WILL

00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:31.428
DEFINITELY RIGHT COMMISSIONER

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:32.997
DOUGLAS HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:34.532
TENACIOUS IN PURSUIT TO BE ABLE

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:36.167

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:37.434
IN THE STATE AND GRATEFUL FOR

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:39.403
HER LEADERSHIP ON THAT. I THINK

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.037
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.239
TO LOOK AT. THE INVESTMENT IN

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.240
TRANSMISSION LINE TO BE ABLE TO

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.708
GET THAT ENERGY INTO THE REST

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.076
OF THE CALIFORNIA GREAT. I

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:46.877
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:48.445
CRITICAL PIECE OF THAT. AND THE

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:49.480
OTHER ITEM AND THIS IS

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:50.214
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.550

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:53.651
COMPANIES ABOUT IN FACT WE

00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:55.953
HOSTED. A COMMITTEE HEARING

IN THE CITY OF EUREKA AND

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.325
HUMBOLDT COUNTY. IS RATHER THAN

CRAB FLEET WE NEED TO LOOK AT A

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:15.472

OF STRIPED BASS THAT'S

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.399
CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE OF

AROUND CERTAIN PLACES IN THE

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:39.242
ESTUARY AND THE CONFLUENCE OF

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:41.478
RIVERS TO THE ESTUARY CALLING

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:43.647
THEM HOT SPOTS ENGAGING IN

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:46.316
TARGETED SCIENTIFIC WORK TO A

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:48.051
RADICALLY WITHIN THE HOT SPOT.

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:49.152
AND THEN ASSESSED

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:50.787
SCIENTIFICALLY WHETHER THAT'S

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:54.391
PRODUCING A POPULATION BENEFIT

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:54.891
FOR WINTER RUN AND OTHER

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.493
IMPERILED SALMON. TURNING TO

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.228
THE MANY THINGS I'VE BEEN ASKED

00:49:58.295 --> 00:49:59.129
TO COVER TODAY LET'S START

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:01.698
WITH- THE RECENT SOUTHERN

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:05.869
CALIFORNIA OIL SPILL. NO OIL

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:09.439
SPILL IS GOOD. THE BEST WILL

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:13.777
SPELL IS ZERO SPILLS A HEART

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:15.379
THEY HURT US ECONOMICALLY THEY

00:50:15.445 --> 00:50:17.647
HEARD US AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL

00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:20.016
THE HARDEST ENVIRONMENTALLY. A

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:22.352
HARDEST AT THE PERSONAL LEVEL

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:25.088
SO ABOUT A MONTH AGO YOU MAY

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:27.023
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING AND

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:29.192
NOW KNOW THAT ABOUT FOUR AND A

FEDERAL WATERS. I HAD A LEAK

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:43.573
THE LIKELY LEAK SOURCE IS ABOUT

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.074
THIRTEEN INCH HORIZONTAL

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:46.309
CRACKS. THIS PIPELINE RUNS

00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:47.344

PREVENTION RESPONSE WAS CREATED

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:14.771
I THINK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE

BY THE LEGISLATURE IT IS THE

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:19.576

00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:07.690
BETTER PREPARE FOR A NEXT BILL.

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.359
LIKE HOW WE MIGHT REOPEN USING

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:11.661
PHASES OR HOW MIGHT WE

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:13.696
STREAMLINED THE SAMPLING EFFORT

00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:16.065
BUT IT'S REALLY NOT- BIBLE

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:18.368
STICKS TO THINK ABOUT. BUILDING

00:57:18.434 --> 00:57:21.304
ANOTHER LAB OR LAB CAPACITY TO

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:22.972
DEAL WITH THIS TECHNOMIC SO AS

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:25.642
OF RIGHT NOW. ALL GOES WELL

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.944
THINGS COME OUR WAY WE MIGHT BE

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:29.879
LOOKING AT AN ABILITY TO

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.815
DISCLOSURE DEALT WITH THEN

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:35.251
REMOVED AS WE GET TO THE END OF

00:57:35.318 --> 00:57:37.620
THIS. MAYBE STOP SCHERING

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:42.158
SCREEN AND LATER TURNED TO. THE

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:44.027
NEXT TOPIC IT IS A DIRECTOR AT

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.995
IS WHEN I DO A QUICK TIME CHECK

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:48.164
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HIT

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.333
DUNGENESS CRAB WHEN I IN THE

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.901
DELAY IN IF YOU CAN COVER ALL

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.269
ISSUES IN REGARDS TO THE

00:57:53.336 --> 00:57:55.471
PRESENCE OF WALES IN. WHEN THE

00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:57.040
LATEST FLIGHTS WERE NOT TO BE

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:58.942
ABLE TO MONITOR WELL SITUATION

00:57:59.008 --> 00:58:00.977
I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU HIT THE

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:02.178
WINNING RUN IN SACRAMENTO AND

00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:04.013
WE CAN. OPEN IT UP FOR

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.481
QUESTIONS AS WELL JUST BECAUSE

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:07.283
THE TIME BUT- LONG TURNED BACK

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.319
OVER TO YOU MR DIRECTOR YEP I

00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:11.020
WAS OLY GONNA DO THREE ISSUES

00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:13.189
EVEN THOUGH THE LONG LISTS FROM

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:13.890
STUFF AND JUST DEAL WITH THE

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:18.561
OTHER THINGS AND CAN AND SO LET

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:19.162
ME TURN TO DROUGHT. AND WINTER

00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:21.598
RUN. IT'S GRAHAM. IT'S IS WORSE

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:23.499
AS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY CAREER

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:26.202
IT'S WORSE. RIGHT NOW THAN IT

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:28.037
WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST

00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:32.108
ROW. NINE TWENTY TWENTY AND

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:33.409
TWENTY TWENTY ONE WATER YEARS

00:58:33.476 --> 00:58:35.245
ARE THE SECOND DRIEST TWO YEAR

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:37.146
PERIODS IN THE HISTORICAL

00:58:37.213 --> 00:58:39.582
RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. SO FORGET

00:58:39.649 --> 00:58:41.017
ABOUT THE NINETEEN SEVENTY JOB

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:42.518
THIS IS WORSE THAN THAT ALL OF

00:58:42.585 --> 00:58:44.387
OUR MAJOR FEDERAL AND STATE

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:45.388
RESERVOIRS SHASTA OR GO FULL

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:48.324
SOME. HAVE SEVERELY LOW STORAGE

00:58:48.391 --> 00:58:48.858
WE ARE IN A HOLE

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:51.227
HYDROLOGICALLY. THE RECENT RAIN

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:54.264
IS SUPER THANKFUL. BUT WE CAN'T

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:55.865
COUNT ON IT WITH SUCH A

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:58.568
HYDROLOGICAL HOLE TO DIG OUT OF

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:00.036
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO CALL KNOW

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:02.739
WHAT LEVELS OF RAIN NO WAS ARC

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:05.341
LEVELS OF RAIN TO GET OUT OF

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:06.943
THE DROUGHT WERE. IN SEVEN FACE

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.544
A SERIES OF THREATS YOU'VE GOT

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:10.513
THE ONGOING DROUGHT CONDITIONS.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.782
YOU'VE GOT A LONG TERM DECLINE

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:15.118
IN POPULATIONS. WE HAD

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:18.421
CONSECUTIVE DRY YEARS OR SEVEN

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:18.955
ZERO NINE THIRTEEN THROUGH

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:21.824
FIFTEEN. WE HAVE COMPETING

00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:23.793
INTERESTS FOR SCARCE WATER.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.094
LOOTING HOW WE MANAGE THE

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:27.730
SCARCE RESOURCE IS AND WE HAVE

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:30.033
RECENT DYNAMICS LIKE INCREASED

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:32.168
EFFICIENCY AND SALMON DIETS OUT

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:33.670
OF THE OCEAN THOSE THINGS

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:36.172
CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATISTICAL

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.241
REPORT UK FROM OUR FEDERAL

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:40.843
AGENTS YOU KNOW. SURVIVAL IN

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:44.714
THE SINGLE DIGITS WE CANNOT GET

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:47.216
RECOVERED SALMON POPULATIONS IS

00:59:47.283 --> 00:59:49.352
EVERY SEVERAL YEARS WE

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:50.920
EXPERIENCE A DYNAMIC WHERE WE

00:59:50.987 --> 00:59:52.488
HAVE SURVIVALS IN THE SINGLE

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:55.024
DIGITS THE POPULATION IS ON ITS

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:58.594
LONG SLOW DECLINE SOME YEARS

00:59:58.661 --> 01:00:00.930
WITHIN THAT ARE GOOD. AS AN

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:03.399
EXAMPLE THIS CURRENT YEAR HAS

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.868
ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY GOOD FOR

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:09.205
FISHING- ON ON SOME OF THE

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.708
FRONTS WE HAD A FIRE THEN USUAL

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.910
RETURNS UP YOU CREEK IS A GOOD

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:16.846
EXAMPLE WE HAD BETTER THAN

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:18.781
PREDICTED FISHING IN THE

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:19.849
COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:24.053
SPACE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.088
FISH THAT HAVE JUST COME BACK.

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:28.191
CAME IN WERE BORN IN WAR WERE

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:28.758
KIND OF RUNNING THROUGH OUR

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:30.860
RIVERS WENT BY RIVER LEVELS ARE

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.862
HIGHER THE CURRENT DROUGHT

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:36.432
SITUATION IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:39.469
VERY BAD RETURNS OF FINISH REAR

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:40.737
FOUR YEARS FROM NOW AND IF WE

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.638
KEEP HAVING. THESE INCREDIBLY

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.807
BAD YEARS WE WILL NOT DIG OUT

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:47.477
OF OUR POPULATION DECLINE

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.412
THAT'S JUST THE REALITY WE'VE

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.581
GOT TO ACCEPT THAT REALITY. SO

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:52.749
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:55.284
THE DEPARTMENT THIS YEAR TRY TO

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.920
MANAGE THROUGH THIS YEAR. WE'RE

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.622

TO OUR ESTUARIES. BUT THIS WILL

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:24.767
JUST BE THE BAND. IT'S TIME TO

RECOVERY NOT AVOIDING JUST

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:34.977
EXTINCTION. WE NEED TO GET

CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOR WE'RE

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:43.419
GONNA RUN OUT OF COLD WATER

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.821
YEAR AFTER YEAR LOOKING THROUGH

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:47.590
THE DECADES IS JUST A REALITY

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.492
DEALING WITH CLIMATE IMPACTS WE

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.726
NEED TO GET THEM INTO THEIR

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.895
HISTORICAL HABITAT. WE'VE GOT A

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.463

SUCCESSFULLY TO THE UPPER PART

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.270
OF THE SYSTEM FASTER WE'VE GOT

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:02.471
TO GET DOWN THE REMAINING

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:03.739

ELECTRIC COMPANY IN BATTLE

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:07.043
CREEK AND MAKE BATTLE CREEK A

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:08.778
REFUGIO FOR CENTRAL VALLEY

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.613
SALMON AS WELL. FRANKLY NEXT

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.114
YEAR WE OUGHT ALSO GO AHEAD PUT

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:14.984
FISH IN THE MCLEOD RIVER ABOVE

SHASTA DAM FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:17.720
TO DO SOME SCIENCE IF WE CAN DO

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:19.455
IT IF WE CAN'T GET THE FISH

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:19.956
THERE WE ALREADY LEASED

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.791
DEPLOYED THE EQUIPMENT. AND GET

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:23.426
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TESTED OUT

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:25.294
SO WE CAN DO A PRETTY PROBLEM

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:26.262
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET SALMON

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.830
INTO OTHER TRIBUTARIES LIKE THE

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:29.498
FEATHER OR MAYBE THE U. BUT AS

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:31.534
WELL IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.202
CHANCE AT BEATING THIS

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.971
POPULATION DECLINE IN THE BIG

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.739
PICTURE. THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:38.741
THINGS ON MY MIND LET ME TURN

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.543
TO CRAP AND HOPEFULLY I'LL GET

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.544
OUT OF THE WAY WITHIN THE TEN

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.446
MINUTES SO THE RECREATIONAL

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:45.581
TANK ATTENTIONS GRAB USING CRAB

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:48.451
TRAPS IN BASICALLY FROM SOME

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:53.422
MOMENTOUS. YOU KNOW DOWN TO

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:55.024
POINTS OR- I WENT. TO MAKE SURE

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:56.025
POINT LOOK POINT BE TEN.

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:58.961
RESTRICT IN A NORMAL WORLD THE

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:00.796
RECREATIONAL CRAB FISHERY WOULD

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:02.665
HAVE COMMENCED THIS NOVEMBER

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.867
SIX- THIS WEEKEND IT IS NOW

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:07.403
DELAYED. AND THAT CENTRAL PART

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.905
OF THE COAST IF YOU'RE UP ABOVE

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:11.674
THE SONOMA COUNTY LINE YOU CAN

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.476
GO AHEAD RECREATIONALLY FISH

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.311
FOR DUNGENESS CRAB. IF YOU'RE

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:18.481
BELOW THE POINT LOPEZ LINE YOU

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:19.081
CAN GO AHEAD AND RECREATION AS

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:22.518
FAST- EVER ALONG THE COAST

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.754
RECREATIONALLY YOU CAN USE

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.556
OTHER TYPES OF FISHING METHODS.

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.125
THAT'S INCREDIBLE STAIRS

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:31.294
RECREATIONALLY YOU CANNOT USE

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.729
THE TRUCKS. ON THE COMMERCIAL

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:38.067
FRONT AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:39.902
RIGHT NOW ALL WE ARE DELAYING

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:42.071
THE COMMERCIAL OPENER IN THAT

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:44.307
MIDDLE PART OF THE STATE. THE

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.776
NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.077
HEADED TOWARDS POTENTIALLY A

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:53.449
DECEMBER FIRST. QUALITY TESTING

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:54.784
OF THE MEAT WHICH IS AN

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.219
ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE THREE

01:05:57.286 --> 01:06:01.924
WEST COAST STATES. AND SOUTH OF

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.460
LOPEZ POINT- I'M SINGLE HAND

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:06.195
COMMERCIALLY FISH THE MIDDLE

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.364
PART OF THE STATE NOT YET AND

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.599
THE REASON IS WE'RE MANAGING. A

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.935
CHANGE IN OUR OCEAN WHICH FOR

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.770
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:16.572
EITHER GIVEN US A DEMO LIKE

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.974
ACID DELAY FOR COMMERCIAL

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:21.577
FISHING WORE A DELAY BECAUSE OF

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.679
PRESENCE OF WHALES AND SEA

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:26.215
TURTLES. SO THE MOST RECENT

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:29.185
INFORMATION I HAVE FROM

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:31.420
YESTERDAY AROUND- WE CONVERT

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:35.257
MILITARY HOURS AROUND THREE PM.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:36.025
SO WE'VE BEEN DOING ADDITIONAL

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:37.259
WELL SURVEYS WE HAVE

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.561
INFORMATION COMING IN FROM

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:40.663
OCTOBER THIRTY AND THIRTY ONE

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.898
FROM CASCADIA RESEARCH. SHOWING

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.734
A CONTINUED PRESENCE OF

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.603
HUMPBACK WHALES IN HIGH NUMBERS

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.605
IN FISHING ZONES THREE AND FOUR

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:51.874
THE RECENT STORM APPEARS TO NOT

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.876
HAVE CLEARED OUT THOSE WHALES-

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:56.345
SURVEYS SHOW UP TO SEVENTY NINE

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.881
WHALES IN ZONE THREE AND TWENTY

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:01.016
WHALES IN ZONE FOR. BOTH OF

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:03.753
THOSE CAN LEVELS EXCEED THE

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:05.588
TRIGGERS IN OUR REGULATIONS

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.256
WE'RE ALSO SEEING INFORMATION

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:08.524
COMING IN FROM THE MONTEREY BAY

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:10.326
A WHALE WATCH THAT SAYS WE'RE

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:12.828
ABOVE TRIGGER LEVELS WE FLEW

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:16.365
OUR OWN DEPARTMENT PLANE ON THE

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:17.466
SECOND TWO DAYS AGO. REALLY

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:20.569
POOR WEATHER LIMITED- VALUE OF

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:22.571
THAT FLIGHT BUT WE DID OBSERVE

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:25.474
WHALES HUMPBACKS IN SOME FREE.

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.543
WE'RE GONNA TRY TO FLY AGAIN AS

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.412
MUCH AS WE CAN. CURRENTLY THE

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.347
WEATHER FORECASTS INDICATES LOW

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:35.184
CLOUDS AND FOG. WHICH MAKES OUR

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:36.285
VISIBILITY FROM THE AIR VERY

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.421
DIFFICULT. I'M COGNIZANT OF

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:41.123
TIME- SOONER JUST LET ME

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.192
CONCLUDE ON THE CROP FRONT AND

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.361
SAY FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:46.962
BEEN APPLYING THIS APPROACH

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:48.464
THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR UNDER

FIRST TIME FOR THE RECREATIONAL

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:56.639
FISHERY WE KNOW THIS IS

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:59.909
DIFFICULT CHANGE TAKES TIME.

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:01.544
WHERE SHOULD HAVE OF OUR

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.212

YEARS WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN A

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:07.243
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE I

HAPPENING TO SACRAMENTO- DO DO

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.558

WE WILL NO LONGER SEE SALMON.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.195
ALONG THE SACRAMENTO DELTA IS

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:27.897
US IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS

01:09:27.963 --> 01:09:30.399
JUST. A FLAT REALITY THAT WE

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:33.269
HAVE TO ACCEPT. NOW I REJECT

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:39.041

REGION AS THE EXAMPLE. WHILE

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:47.416
THEY MAY BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:48.784
WE STILL HAVE SOUTHERN STILL

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:51.754
HAD RECESS IN WHAT ARGUABLY IS

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.589
THE BIGGEST MEGALOPOLIS IN THE

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:57.159
WORLD FROM- THE INTERNATIONAL

01:09:57.226 --> 01:10:00.596
BORDER UP TO SANTA BARBARA.

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:03.899
SOMETIMES FISH SOUTHERN STILL

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:06.402
HAD HEARTY VERSIONS OF SALMON

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:09.838
SWIM BACK INTO. MALIBU CREEK

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:16.679
OR- TRIBUTE GO CREEK OR- DALY

01:10:16.745 --> 01:10:19.148
RIVER OR VENTURA RIVER. THEY

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:21.917
PERSIST PERSIST OVER TIME

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.752
NATURE IS STRONG FOR JUST GIVE

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:25.921
HER HALF A CHANCE AND GIVING

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.723
OUR HAVE THE CHANCE INCLUDES

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:30.059
THINGS LIKE WE'RE GONNA TAKE

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:32.294
OUT SOME A DAM IN MATTEL HOT

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:34.530
CREEK TRIBUTARY TO THE VENTURA

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:37.132
RIVER AND OPEN UP ACCESS TO

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.268
SOUTHERN STILL HAD. AND IN

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:40.669
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.338
TO COMPLETE IT'LL BE THE END OF

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.340
MAY BUT COMPLETE THE WORLD'S

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.175
BIGGEST DAM REMOVAL RIVER

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:46.909
RESTORATION PROJECT ON THE

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:49.645
KLAMATH. AND OPEN UP THAT RIVER

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.580
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PLUS MILES

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:52.848
HISTORICAL HABITAT TO STAND

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:55.484
STILL. IF WE GIVE NATURE IN

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:58.120
THESE FISHES CHANCE BABY WILL

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:00.122
SURVIVE. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:03.659
IT'S- COMPLICATED BY THE FACT

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:06.328
IN MIND YOU. THESE FISH ARE

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:09.865
LIMITED TO LIVING ON THE TOP.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.668
FLOOR AND DAMS IN THE CENTRAL

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:14.670
VALLEY PROJECT FOR WATER IN THE

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.005
STATE WATER PROJECT ARE SO

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:17.940
LARGE AND INDISPENSABLE FOR

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:20.175
HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE ARE

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:21.910
STUCK IN A SITUATION THINKING

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:24.046
ABOUT WATER MANAGEMENT OF THE

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.748
SCARCE RESOURCE IN A WARMING

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:28.083
CLIMATE. AND THESE FISH CANNOT

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:31.420
ACCESS HISTORICAL HABITAT I

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.455
THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:34.857
TO THE OPTION OF PUTTING THEM

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:37.292
BACK ABOVE RIM DOWNS AS PART OF

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:39.895
OUR STRATEGY. BUT THEY SHOW AS

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.363
THEY CAN SURVIVE WE JUST HAVE

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.499
TO GIVE ME A CHANCE SO I REJECT

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:46.468
THE IDEA WE'RE GONNA LOSE

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:47.002
CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON AND

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:47.770
STEELHEAD. I DON'T THINK WE

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.271
HAVE RECOVERED PABLO

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:50.606
POPULATIONS WITHOUT A WHOLE

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:52.608
HECK OF A LOT OF HARD WORK. AND

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:55.377
TRYING THINGS AND BEEN WILLING

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:58.514
TO TRY AS A SOCIETY. ALSO JUST

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.950
VERY BRIEFLY A MORE POSITIVE-

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:04.486
SUBJECT YOU HAVE OVERSEEN- THE

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:06.388
KLAMATH RIVERS RESTORATION IN

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:09.992
THE- ELIMINATION OF THE KLAMATH

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:12.861
DAM- THAT THIS- LEGISLATURE

01:12:12.928 --> 01:12:14.930
FUNDED I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.432
YOU COULD PROVIDE US AN UPDATE

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:17.566
ON HOW THAT PROJECT IS GOING

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:19.501
AND- WHAT ITS CONTRIBUTION IS

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:21.704
GOING TO BE. GOING TO BE TWO

SCENE I MEAN LOOK I THINK THAT-

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:43.912
WE'RE BEGINNING TO WATCH. THE

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.014
EXTINCTION OF A CONDUCT SPECIES

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:48.450
RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES. IN

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:49.985
EACH YEAR IT KEEPS GETTING

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:52.421
WORSE FOR SALMON HERE IN THE

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:55.724
GOLDEN STATE. BUT I'M ALSO A

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.659
FIRM BELIEVER THAT ANTIQUATED

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:59.094
FEDERAL WATER POLICIES

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.864
CONTRIBUTED. TO THIS SPECIES

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:04.766
DECLINE IN OLD CEMENT. DIE OFF

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.668

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:08.337
I HAVE A SEVEN MONTH OLD AT

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:15.510
THAT HE WILL NEVER SEE. SALMON

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:15.978
THAT WHEN A RUN IN THE

01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:19.781
SACRAMENTO. SO THERE ARE

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:22.484
THERE'S SOME MOVEMENT PIVOTING

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:26.355
AWAY FROM THE TRUMP ERA

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:28.657
BIOLOGICAL OPINION FOR CENTRAL

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:30.492
VALLEY BUT WE STILL SEE THE

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:32.327
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT PROCESS IN

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:34.263
PLACE IN THE SACRAMENTO. WHAT

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:35.397
DO YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:38.233
THAT MR DIRECTOR BECAUSE I'M A

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.101
FIRM BELIEVER I THINK THERE

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:41.470
ARE. CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:43.438
UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:46.108
FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT. FEDERAL

01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:48.277
WATER POLICY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:50.279
THIS SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:53.749
ADDITION TO THE DROUGHT. AND

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:54.883
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE CAN'T

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:57.085
COUNT ON COLD WATER. IS BECAUSE

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:59.688
OF THE POLICIES OF THE PAST SO

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:01.590
MISTER DIRECTOR YOU WANT TO

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:06.328
COMMENT ON THAT. YES I'M

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.263
BECAUSE YOU ASK- I'LL BE

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:11.733
DIRECTING GIVE YOU MY VIEW SO.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.269
AS MOST PARTICIPATING TO KNOW

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:17.272
TODAY REALIZE- THE STATE OF

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:19.141
CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE NATURAL

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:21.877
RESOURCES AGENCY AND OUR STATE

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:23.946
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:25.247
AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:26.615
THROUGH THE CAPACITY OF OUR

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:29.651
ATTORNEY GENERAL. DID CHALLENGE

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:31.553
IN FEDERAL COURT WHAT ARE

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.988
CALLED THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:33.989
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.624
IT'S A FANCY WORD FOR OPERATING

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:38.961
RULES. FOR THE- FEDERAL CENTRAL

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:43.799
VALLEY PROJECT. AND RECENTLY

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.233
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.235
AGREED AND INFORM THE FEDERAL

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:49.771
COURT THAT IT WILL GO BACK AND

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:52.908
REDO THOSE RULES. I THINK

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.943
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT OUTCOME I

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:58.847
THINK MANY IN THIS PHONE CALL

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.615
THAT MAY PRESENT ON SUBSEQUENT

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:03.318
PANELS HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:06.355
THAT OUTCOME. SO WE'LL END UP

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:09.725
WITH NEW OPERATING RULES THAT

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:10.225
GOVERN THE FEDERAL WATER

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:14.029
PROJECT. MY HOPE IS THAT THOSE

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:15.397
RULES CAN BE DEVELOPED IN

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.765
COLLABORATION ACROSS ALL

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:18.934
AGENCIES BIOLOGICAL AGENCIES

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:23.672
AND WATER. BY AGENCIES THAT

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:26.208
THEY WILL ACCOUNT FOR ACTIVE

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:27.876
MEASURES THEY GIVE US A SENSE

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:30.779
OF IN ANY PLANNING CYCLE HOW

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:33.815
WILL HAVE PROTECTIVE THRESHOLDS

01:17:33.882 --> 01:17:35.751
FOR SALMON AND STEELHEAD. MY

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:38.253
HOPE IS THAT WE'LL HAVE AN

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.988
APPROACH THAT THINKS THROUGH

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:41.356
THE INTEGRATION OF ALL THESE

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:43.158
MAJOR RESERVOIRS RELATIVE TO

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:44.760
COLD WATER AND HOW YOU MANAGE

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:48.130
RESERVOIRS. AND MY HOPE IS THE

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:49.998
OUTCOME WILL BE A MORE STABLE

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:52.768
CENTER RULES. STABLE FOR WATER

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:55.637
SUPPLY BUT ALSO MORE PROTECTIVE

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:56.772
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE GONNA

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:58.707
HAVE TO. WORK THROUGH THAT IT'S

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:00.142
GONNA TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:03.011
THESE ARE NOT. PROCESS SEES

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.313
THAT SWITCH OVER NINE. IN THE

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.517
INTERIM MY OWN PERSONAL VIEWIS

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.285
NEXT CALENDAR YEAR OF THIS

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:12.954
WATER YEAR. MOST PEOPLE ARE ON

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:14.423
THE PHONE CALL I THINK REALIZE

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:16.992
WATER YEARS RUN FROM. YEAH END

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:19.061
OF OCTOBER THROUGH THE

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:22.464
FOLLOWING. AND I THINK NEXT

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.833
YEAR IS GOING TO BE JUST FINE

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.135
USUAL UNPRECEDENTED WE ARE

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:28.670
LOOKING AT THE HOUSE THE

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:31.973
LIKELIHOOD OF A THIRD JURAI

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.309
CRITICALLY DRY HYDROLOGICALLY

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.411
ON PRESIDENT CHALLENGING YEAR.

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:38.146
AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT NEXT

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:40.549
YEAR MINE MINE OUTSIDE OUR

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:43.785
USUAL STATUS QUO MENTALITY WE

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:46.021
NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT RISK

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.489
MANAGEMENT WE NEED TO BE

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:49.691
THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS OUR-

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:52.427
MOST IMAGINABLE. WORST CASE

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:55.630
SCENARIO AND THEN BE READY TO

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:56.631
DEAL WITH THAT AND I THINK WE

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:59.201
CAN. YEAH NO NINE AND MR GEORGE

01:18:59.267 --> 01:19:00.368
I THINK WE WERE A 100%

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:02.104
AGREEMENT IN NIGHT- AND I DON'T

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.438
EVER WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:05.740
DIRECTOR OR THE AGENCY BUT- I

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.309
THINK HE WANTS TO MOVE WITH

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:10.078
SPEED I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:12.848
HAVE TIME. TO BE ABLE TO GO

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.216
THROUGH TRADITIONAL RULE MAKING

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:15.517
PROCESS AND WE KNOW THAT THIS

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:16.618
SPECIES ON THE BRINK OF

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:18.620
EXTINCTION IN IS ABSOLUTELY ON

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.755
THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION TWO

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:26.428
THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WAS BAD- TWO

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:27.662
THOUSAND FOURTEEN WAS BAD IT

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:29.931
KEEPS GETTING WORSE AND NOW

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:31.600
WE'RE GONNA BE GOING THROUGH A

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:32.868
RULEMAKING PROCESS IN THE

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:33.802
CENTRAL VALLEY WE STILL HAVE

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.170
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS BY THE WAY

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.972
IN THE SACRAMENTO. IN THAT

01:19:37.038 --> 01:19:40.575
WHOLE WINTER RUN- IS ABSOLUTELY

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:42.611
THREATENED TO GO EXTINCT HERE

01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:43.979
IN THE COMING YEARS AND SO I

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:46.848
HAVE DEEP CONCERNS. ABOUT HOW

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:49.684
LONG THIS IS GOING TO TAKE- AND

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:55.524
WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS ARE. IF

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.125
WE DON'T MOVE WITH SPEED. THAT

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:57.726
SO WHICH IS WHICH IS WHY FOR

01:19:57.792 --> 01:20:01.463
NOW YEAR- I THINK OUR APPROACH

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:02.864
NEXT YEAR HAS TO INVOLVE

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:05.000
PRIVATIZATION I THINK WE AS

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:06.568
CALIFORNIANS NEED TO BE

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:09.171
THINKING FIRST ABOUT. WATER FOR

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:11.239
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:12.274
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE CANDEAL

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.842
WITH PEOPLE HAVE WATER AT THEIR

01:20:13.909 --> 01:20:17.345
TOP. THEN I THINK WENEED TO BE

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:19.214
LOOKING AT WHEN A RUN IN THE

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:20.749
SALMON RIVER. ARE IN THE

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:22.984
SACRAMENTO RIVER MANY THINKING

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:25.253
ABOUT TEMPERATURE CRITERIA. AND

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.122
MANAGING FOR THAT BECAUSE THESE

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.090
FISH MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:31.326
TOLERATE A THIRD YEAR LIKE THE

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.628
LAST TWO YEARS. AND AFTER WE

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.297
WORK THROUGH THAT PRIVATIZATION

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:36.565
WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:38.900
OUR RESERVOIRS. THERE CARRY

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:40.569
OVER AS WE HEAD INTO THE

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.437
FOLLOWING CALENDAR YEAR AND

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.773
THEN DEALING WITH ALL THE VERY

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:46.741
IMPORTANT USES OF WATER OUR

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.243
AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY OUR

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:49.678
WILDLIFE REFUGES BUT WE'RE

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:51.646
GONNA NEED SOME. FORM OF

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:53.915
PRIVATIZATION THAT ALLOWS US TO

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:55.517
LOOK AT PUBLIC HEALTH AND

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:58.286
SAFETY AND THEN TRY TO FOCUS IN

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.121
AFTER THAT ON THESE WINTER RUNS

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:02.591
**** THAT'S MY- 100% I THINK

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:03.425
THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:07.062
HAVE IN THIS IS. NOT WITHIN.

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:10.065
THE DIRECTORS. PURVIEW IS THAT

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:12.968
YOU KNOW THE STATE. I HAD

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.703
IMPLEMENTED NEW WATER FLOW

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:17.639
RULES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:18.273
EIGHTEEN YET WE HAVEN'T

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.674
IMPLEMENTED THOSE NEW WATER

01:21:19.741 --> 01:21:21.743
FLOW RULES THAT WOULD PROVIDE A

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:24.512
COLD WATER SOURCE- AND IN THE

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.748
MEANTIME. I'M GONNA KEEP GOING

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:27.949
BACK TO WHAT WERE SEEN AND

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:32.988
AGAIN THIS IS OUTSIDE OF THE.

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:34.889
WE CONTINUE TO SEE SPECIES

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.992
GOING EXTINCT EXTINCT IN FRONT

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.628
OF OUR EYES RIGHT NOW- AND IT

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:42.230
IS ICONIC FISHERY IN THE STATE

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:43.999
IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:45.834
THAT WE MOVE WITH SPEED WE HAVE

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.003
RULES THAT WE COULD USE. A AND

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.904
FOR SOME REASON HAVE NOT BEEN

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:52.073
ENACTED INTO DEEP CONCERN WE'LL

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.276
ALSO HEAR FROM- ENVIRONMENTAL

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:56.044
AND CONSERVATION LEADERS IN

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.812
JUST A FEW MOMENTS IN OUR NEXT

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:59.047
PANEL FOCUS ON THE DROUGHT

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:00.882
CRISIS IN SALMON FISHERIES IN

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:02.851
AND I DON'T WANNA LEAVE THIS

01:22:02.917 --> 01:22:04.653
DISCUSSION LET ME SIMPLY BEING

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:07.322
CRITICAL BECAUSE I GOTTA SAY

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:08.590
DIRECTOR BONHAM HIS TEAMMATE

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:09.457
CALIFORNIA APARTMENT FISH AND

01:22:09.524 --> 01:22:10.859
WILDLIFE. WORKING IN

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:11.593
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.194
LEGISLATURE QUITE FRANKLY OF

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.296
PROVIDING THE DEPARTMENT WITH

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:15.363
THE FUNDING THEY NEED TO BE

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:16.898
ABLE TO MOVE WITH SPEED TO BE

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.533
ABLE TO SAVE THIS SPECIES WITH

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.802
A BAND AID APPROACH RIGHT

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:21.903
HEARING ABOUT TRUCKING

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.472
LITERALLY SEVENTEEN MILLION.

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:27.342
FISHERY HATCHED SALMON AND

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:29.044
PUTTING THEM IN THE ACTUARIES

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.879
TO ENSURE THEIR SURVIVAL IS

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:34.182
CRITICAL BUT IT IS NOT A LONG

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.551
TERM STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS AND

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:37.419
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BE ABLE

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:39.721
TO LOOK AT LONG TERM POLICY

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.623
CHANGES OBVIOUSLY LOOKING

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:43.191
HEALTH ND SAFETY OF RESIDENTS

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:46.061
FIRST BUT THEN ALSO FOCUSING ON

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.229
THIS ICONIC FISH SPECIES HERE

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:50.699
IN CALIFORNIA. I I'D LIKE TO-

ALL ISSUES OF IS. LOOK I'M JUST

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.207
GOING TO BE BLUNT TONIGHT I

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:01.176
DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL BUT

01:23:01.242 --> 01:23:02.310
I'M VERY NERVOUS MISTER

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:03.645
DIRECTOR ABOUT HITTING THAT

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:07.549
THANKSGIVING MARKET- FOR-

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:09.484
DIGENIS CRAB. WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.785
THE MAJORITY DUNGEONS CRABS

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:13.722
CONSUME BETWEEN- THANKSGIVING

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:17.258
AND THE END OF THE YEAR- YOUR

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:19.260
CRYSTAL BALL NOW SIR AND I KNOW

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:19.928
YOU DON'T LIKE MAKING

01:23:19.994 --> 01:23:21.896
PREDICTIONS. BUT I THINK IT IS

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:24.699
IN A FULL COURT PRESS TO TRY TO

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:25.633
BE ABLE TO GET THIS FISHERY

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.802
OPENED. AT A MINIMUM AT A

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:30.939
MINIMUM- FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:34.309
WHEN IT COMES TO- CHRISTMAS.

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:36.344
THE NEW YEAR AND HANUKKAH- BUT

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:38.113
I'M NERVOUS IN REGARDS TO THE

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:39.714
SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA MONTEREY

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:42.517
BAY AS WELL AS A CINEMA IN

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:44.152
MARIN COUNTY'S. BECAUSE OF THE

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.854
PRESENCE OF WALES IS THAT A-

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.355
CORRECT ASSESSMENT IN REGARDS

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:48.423
TO HITTING THESE GIVING BUT

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:51.826
REALLY TRYING TO PUSH FOR THE

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:54.396
HOLIDAY SEASON FOR CHRISTMAS.

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:56.231
I'M NERVOUS LIKE YOU YEAH. I'VE

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:57.932
LIVED THROUGH THE LAST COUPLE

01:23:57.999 --> 01:24:01.336
YEARS WITH YOU- I THINK RIGHT

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:04.339
NOW. WE JUST NEED TO ACCEPT THE

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:06.307
CALENDAR SPACE BETWEEN NOVEMBER

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:09.377
FOURTH. AND THANKSGIVING IS

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:11.713
SHRINKING AND THERE'S A LT OF

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.181
STUFF WE HAVE TO DO ON OUR

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:16.184
SIDE. RELATIVE TO THAT KIND OF

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:18.820
THANKSGIVING MARKER WE NEED TO

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:20.622
KEEP GETTING IN THE AIR AS MUCH

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:22.590
AS WE CAN FOR AERIAL SURVEYS

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:24.726
THAT TAKES GETTING UP THERE

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:26.494
WEATHER PERMITTING PROCESSING

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:28.696
THAT DATA WE NEED TO KEEP OPEN

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:30.265
THE OTHER INFORMATION STREAMS

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:33.735
LIKE CASCADIA. WHALE WATCH BUT

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.537
THEN WE WOULD NEED TO PROCESS

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:38.406
ALL THAT INFORMATION. WE HAVE A

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:41.142
RISK ASSESSMENT. MOMENT ON THE

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:43.378
CALENDAR WITH THE COLLABORATIVE

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:45.146
WORKING GROUP COMMERCIAL

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:46.114
RECREATIONAL CONSERVATION

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:48.616
GROUPS IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED I

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:50.685
THINK FOR NOVEMBER A- WE NEED

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:53.955
TO THEN. ENGAGE THE WORKING

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:56.257
GROUP WE NEED TO TURN AROUND

01:24:56.324 --> 01:24:59.060
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE NEED TO

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:01.262
GO BACK OUT FOR NOTICE BECAUSE

01:25:01.329 --> 01:25:02.730
THAT'S THE WAY THE RULES AND

01:25:02.797 --> 01:25:05.667
LAWS WORK. EVEN IF WE GOT SUPER

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:07.969
FORTUNATE AND THE WHALES AND

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:10.071
TURTLES OF ACTUALLY DEPARTED.

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:12.540
IT WOULD STILL BE A VERY TIGHT

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.210
SQUEEZE TO TRY TO GET ALL THAT

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:16.911
DONE BEFORE THANKSGIVING IT'S

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:19.981
POSSIBLE. WE SHOULD HOLD OUT

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:20.482
HOPE THAT HOPE IS NOT A

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:22.550
STRATEGY. SO I THINK

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:24.486
SIMULTANEOUSLY AT THE

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:26.521
DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE AN EYE ON

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:27.922
THANKSGIVING BUT WE ALSO HAVE

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:29.858
AN EYE ON YOU KNOW THE END OF

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:31.759
DECEMBER I THINK ANNIKA'S MUCH

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:33.328
EARLIER THIS YEAR BUT LET'S SAY

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:34.996
MID IN DECEMBER STARTED THE NEW

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:39.033
YEAR. SADLY A COUPLE OF THE

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.002
LAST CYCLES WE'VE MISSED ALL

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:42.971
THE HOLIDAY SEASON. GETTING A

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:44.906
NEW YEAR. SO WE HAVE AN EYE ON

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.574
THANKSGIVING BUT WE ALSO HAVE

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.510
AN EYE ON THAT DECEMBER PERIOD

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:49.544
AND IF WE CAN'T GET

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:51.813
THANKSGIVING WE ARE TRYING TO

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:55.250
WORK TOWARDS DECEMBER. YOU KNOW

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:58.286
THIS- WE HAVE TRIED THIS

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:00.522
SEVERAL TIMES THE LAST SEVERAL

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:02.991
YEARS AND WHEN THE DEPARTMENT.

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:04.759
GEARS OUT I'M A GUYVER WAY

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.427
BALANCE WHALES AND GET THE

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.329
FLEET SOAP AND OCCASIONALLY THE

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:09.931
FLEET HAS DECIDED THEY DON'T

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:12.500
WANT TO GO FISH. SO I'M SUPER

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:15.303
NERVOUS WE'LL TRY THIS AGAIN

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:18.740
AND THE FLEET. CURRENT IS IN

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:20.642
THE EYE WITH A FINGER AT THE

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:23.144
END OF THE DAY SO WE'VE GOT TO

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:24.279
WORK THROUGH IT TOGETHER. HAVE

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:26.814
ANY CHANCE OF GETTING BOATS OUT

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:28.850
COMMERCIALLY IT'S TIME FOR THE

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.285
END OF THE YEAR HOLIDAYS LET

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:31.586
ALONE THANKSGIVING YEAH WHAT

01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:35.690
I'M HOPING IS BECAUSE- FROZEN

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:37.792
STOCK HAS BEEN DEPLETED BECAUSE

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:41.563
THE BLEAK YEAR LAST YEAR- THERE

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:46.401
ISN'T A LOT OF. SUPPLY LEFT- IN

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:48.770
FREEZERS FOR FROM PROCESSORS

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.204
WHICH MEANS I'M HOPING THAT

01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:51.272
PRICE YEAH I'M JUST GOING TO BE

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:52.974
VERY BLUNT HERE MISTER DIRECTOR

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:54.676
I'M HOPING THAT PRICES AT A

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:56.811
GOOD POINT SO THAT THE FLEET

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.813
CAN GO OUT ABOUT ONCE WHALES

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.114
HAVE MOVED SOUTH FOR THE

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:01.816
WINTER- AND WE CAN GET THIS

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.952
SEASON KICKED OFF. BECAUSE I

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.987
THINK THT'S BEEN ONE OF THE

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:08.056
UNDERTONES OF THIS TOO IS

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.424
OBVIOUSLY THE FLEET HAS DONE

01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.959
ALL THEY CAN AND I WANT TO SAY

01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:12.293
THANK YOU BECAUSE THE FLEET IS

TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.165
INSURE THAT THERE ISN'T A

01:27:17.231 --> 01:27:18.700
PRESENCE OF WHALES AND THEY

01:27:18.766 --> 01:27:20.034
BROUGHT THAT FOR THEMSELVES AND

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:21.803
BY THE WAY WE'LL ENTANGLEMENTS.

01:27:21.869 --> 01:27:24.205
ARE DOWN AND MENTALLY OVER THE

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:25.340
LAST FOUR YEARS I THINK WE'RE

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:28.176
AT LIKE SIXTY SEVEN OR SEVENTY

01:27:28.242 --> 01:27:29.344
TWO JUST FIVE YEARS AGO I THINK

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:32.213
WE HAD ONE OR TWO LAST YEAR- MR

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.681
DIRECTOR I MEAN IT IT'S DOWN

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.883
CONSIDERABLY- AND I'M HOPING

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:36.818
THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:38.453
PRICE YEAR SINCE THERE REALLY

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:40.188

DISEASE PATHOGEN IN THE FEATHER

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:05.780
RIVER CALLED C. SHASTA. IT'S

01:33:05.846 --> 01:33:07.715
THE SAME DISEASE PATHOGEN THAT.

01:33:07.782 --> 01:33:10.985
ANNUALLY TAKES OUT. ALL KINDS

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:11.519
OF JUVENILE SALMON ON THE

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:13.354
KLAMATH RIVER. I'VE COME TO

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:14.956
FIND OUT IT'S PROBABLY AS

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:17.491
PREVALENT AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:20.528
SO IN THE FEATHER RIVER. AND IT

01:33:20.594 --> 01:33:22.196
AFFLICTS A JUVENILE FISH ON

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:23.798
THEIR WAY OUT OF THE RIVER AND

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:26.500
ITS LETHAL- IN A RECENT SURVEY

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:29.136
I WAS TOLD THAT. OF FISH TRAP

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:31.072
TO THE UPPER FEATHER RIVER AND

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:32.773
RE TRAPPED A MERE FOURTEEN

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.543
MILES DOWNSTREAM. ONLY 50% OF

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:37.712
THEM SHOWED UP FOURTEEN MILES

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:39.280
DOWNSTREAM THE REST FOR LOST.

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:40.381
AND THOSE TRAPPED DOWNSTREAM

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:41.749
WERE ALL INFECTED WITH C.

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:43.718
SHASTA SO. THE CHANCE THEY

01:33:43.784 --> 01:33:45.753
NEVER MADE IT OUT TO THE OCEAN.

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.687
THE FEATHER RIVER HATCHERY IS

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:48.122
TOLD US THIS YEAR THAT THEY'LL

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:50.825
PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT

01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:51.993
SEVEN FIVE BILLION FISH OVER

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:54.462

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:01.202
SHASTA. THAT THE FEATHER RIVER

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:02.837
HATCHERY CONSIDER PRODUCING

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:04.672
THIS ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SEVEN

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:05.673
FIVE MILLION EVERY YEAR GOING

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.675
FORWARD. THE C. SHASTA THE

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:10.277
FEATHER RIVER IS PROBABLY DUE

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:11.679
TO A WATER TEMPERATURES OF LOW

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.681
FLOWS WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:15.116
IN OTHER RIVERS AND THAT CAN BE

01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:16.650
DIRECTLY TRACED BACK TO

01:34:16.717 --> 01:34:19.286

SUGGEST AS PART OF A FULL

01:34:25.426 --> 01:34:27.461
MITIGATION RESPONSIBILITY- THE

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:29.296
HATCHERY CONSIDER PRODUCING

01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:30.131
THESE ADDITIONAL FISH GOING

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:32.299
FORWARD. ALSO RIGHT NOW THE

01:34:32.366 --> 01:34:33.334
HATCHERY THERE TO FILL THE

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.735
RIVERS RELEASING ABOUT A

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:36.570
MILLION HATCHERY FISH INTO THE

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:39.106
FEATHER RIVER ANNUALLY- THIS IS

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:40.674
BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT FIVE TO

01:34:40.741 --> 01:34:42.877
SEVEN YEARS THE CODED WIRE TAG.

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:44.245
DATA FROM THESE VICIOUS PRETTY

01:34:44.311 --> 01:34:46.180
CLEAR WE'RE LOSING A MALL.

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:47.615
BETWEEN PREDATION AND C.

01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:50.851
SHASTA. THIS IS A- A WASTE

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:53.454
BASICALLY. BEFORE FIVE SEVEN

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:54.522
YEARS AGO THESE FISH FOR TRUCK

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.390
TO THE BAY AND CONTRIBUTED TO

01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:57.925
THE FISHERIES BUT THEY NO

01:34:57.992 --> 01:35:00.161
LONGER DO. SO WE'D LIKE TO ASK

01:35:00.227 --> 01:35:01.562
FOR CONSIDERATION THAT THIS

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:03.464
PRACTICE EITHER BE ELIMINATED.

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:04.865
OR THIS ONE MILLION FISH

01:35:04.932 --> 01:35:07.001
RELEASED BE GREATLY PARED DOWN

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:09.070
TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:10.805
FISH AT THE MOST. THAT SHOULD

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:13.374
SUPPLY THE STATISTICAL VALIDITY

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.609
FOR ANY DATA- THAT IS BEING

01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:19.947
GATHERED FROM THIS PRACTICE. I

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:20.514
WANT TO SHIFT DOWN TO SPEAK

01:35:20.581 --> 01:35:22.183
BRIEF WE HAVE- WERE FISHER. IN

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:25.219
IT OR SAN. BAY THE TRADITIONAL

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:26.821
AND HISTORIC RELEASE LOCATIONS

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:29.457
AROUND VALLEJO. OVER THE LAST

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:30.591
FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS FISHER BEEN

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:32.827
RELEASED OUT OF SAUSALITO.

01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:33.994
ENOUGH DATA HAS NOW BEEN

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:35.596
COLLECTED BUT WE CAN SEE

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:38.032
CLEARLY. THAT SAUSALITO RELEASE

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:40.734
FISH SURVIVE IT ABOUT TWICE.

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:41.836
WHAT THE FISH RELEASED IN

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:43.604
VALLEJO SURVIVE THAT THE

01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:45.739
DEPARTMENT IS- PRETTY GOOD

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:47.241
ABOUT STARTING TO CONSIDER

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:49.210
MOVING RELEASES FURTHER WEST.

01:35:49.276 --> 01:35:51.078
BUT WE WANT TO STRONGLY SUPPORT

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:53.781
THAT. IT'S NOT CLEAR OTHER THAN

01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:55.649
THE LOGISTICS THAT VALLEJOS

01:35:55.716 --> 01:35:58.152
CLOSER AND HAS. EASY FACILITIES

01:35:58.219 --> 01:35:59.320
TO WORK IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY WE

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:00.688
SHOULDN'T BE MOVING ALL OF OUR

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:03.057
RELEASES FURTHER WEST. IT GIVES

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:05.659
US BASICALLY. THE EQUIVALENT OF

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:07.094
EE OUR HATCHERY PRODUCTION

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:08.662
SIMPLY BY KEEPING THE TRUCKS ON

01:36:08.729 --> 01:36:12.733
THE ROAD JUST A FEW MORE MILES

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.334
AND GETTING THEM OUT NEAR THE

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.768
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE- I WANT TO

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:15.970
SWITCH AGAIN AND SPEAK REAL

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:17.671
BRIEFLY ABOUT CODED WIRE TAGS.

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:18.839
THESE ARE THE LITTLE BITS OF

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:21.308
WIRE- THAT- IN PLACED INTO THE

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:24.612
SNOUT. OF JUVENILE SALMON. THE

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:25.980
SALMON HAVE TO BE ABOUT THREE

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:28.616
INCHES LONG. IN ORDER FOR THE

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.317
MACHINES TO DO THIS IN MASS

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:32.353
QUANTITIES TO HANDLE THEM BUT

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:33.387
THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU'RE

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:37.124
GROWN THREE INCHES BIG ENOUGH-TO RECEIVE THAT TAG. YOU'RE

01:36:37.191 --> 01:36:38.893
BURNING UP THE CALENDAR YOU'VE

01:36:38.959 --> 01:36:40.694
GONE FROM WINTER INTO SPRING.

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:41.996
AND IF THESE FISH RLEASED INTO

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:44.965
THE SACRAMENTO BASIN BY APRIL

01:36:45.032 --> 01:36:46.901
YOU'VE GOT- AGRICULTURAL WATER

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:48.669
DIVERSIONS- REDUCING THE

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:50.237
QUALITY OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.972
FOR THESE FISH TO GET OUT. AND

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:52.973
YOU ALSO HAVE PREDATORS LIKE

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.608
STRIPED BASS AND START TO SWIM

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:56.777
UP INTO THE RIVER AND GOBBLE

01:36:56.844 --> 01:36:59.280
THESE FISH. SO THE GOLDEN STATE

01:36:59.346 --> 01:37:00.781
SALMON ASSOCIATION HAS

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:02.149

THE COLEMAN NATIONALHATCHERY

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.721
TO TRY A DIFFERENT APPROACH.

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:09.290
COLEMAN HATCHERY WILL PRODUCE

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:10.758
AN ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION FISH

THIS YEAR BUT INSTEAD OF

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:14.061
GROWING ABOUT TO THREE INCHES

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:16.564
AND TAGGING THEM. WE'RE TAKING

01:37:16.630 --> 01:37:18.599
TISSUE SAMPLES FROM THE ADULT

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:20.768
FISH THE PARROT FISH THAT'S A

01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:22.369
SHOT OF ME UP BUT- CALLED IN A

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:24.605
FEW WEEKS AGO. THOSE TISSUE

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:26.774
SAMPLES WILL BE ANALYZED FOR

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.443
THEIR DNA. AND THREE YEARS FROM

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.378
NOW WHEN THE OFFSPRING SWIM

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:32.947
BACK UP TO THE SACRAMENTO RIVER

AND SHE SHE WAS SAMPLED. A DNA

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:36.817
ANALYSIS WILL BE DONE ON A MAN

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:38.719
WILL BE ABLE TO COMPARE WHICH

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.354
OF THOSE RETURNING FISH WERE

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:43.157

CHINOOK SALMON IN THE CENTRAL

01:47:10.357 --> 01:47:11.391
VALLEY BUT I WANT TO TAKE A

01:47:11.458 --> 01:47:12.893
MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:47:12.959 --> 01:47:13.960
DEVASTATING SITUATION PASTING

01:47:14.027 --> 01:47:16.129
DATA. NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES.

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:17.464
AND THE SAME THEY DEPEND ON IN

01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:19.065
THE KLAMATH BASIN INCLUDING

01:47:19.132 --> 01:47:21.301
THE- CONTRAST RIVERS. MANY OF

01:47:21.368 --> 01:47:22.502
THE PROBLEMS THAT SAME INCREASE

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:24.738
IN THOSE STREAMS. ARE THE SAME

01:47:24.805 --> 01:47:25.872
AS THE PROBLEMS WE FACE IN THE

01:47:25.939 --> 01:47:27.174
CENTRAL VALLEY LACK OF ADEQUATE

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.408
INSTREAM FLOWS IN EXCESS OF

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:29.676
WATER TEMPERATURES LARGELY

01:47:29.743 --> 01:47:31.044
CAUSED BY OVER ALLOCATION OF

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:32.279
WATER RIGHTS AND UNSUSTAINABLE

01:47:32.345 --> 01:47:34.047
WATER DIVERSIONS. AND THOSE

01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:37.918
ADVERSE IMPACTS ARE ARE FAR

01:47:37.984 --> 01:47:38.485
MORE SEVERE IN DROUGHT YEARS

01:47:38.552 --> 01:47:39.319
LIKE THIS. IN THE CENTRAL

01:47:39.386 --> 01:47:40.187
VALLEY WE ARE FACING

01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:41.388
DEVASTATING MORTALITY THIS

01:47:41.454 --> 01:47:43.323
YEAR. YESTERDAY I RECEIVED AN

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:44.391
UPDATE FROM THE FEDERAL

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:46.026
NATIONAL. MARINE FISHERIES

01:47:46.092 --> 01:47:47.794
SERVICE ESTIMATING THAT. THEY

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:49.696
NOW ESTIMATE THAT 75% OF THE

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:50.564
HIGHLY ENDANGERED WINTER RUN

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:53.099
CHINOOK SALMON WERE KILLED THIS

01:47:53.166 --> 01:47:53.633
YEAR SOLELY BY LEGAL WATER

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:55.402
TEMPERATURE. AND WHEN YOU ADD

01:47:55.468 --> 01:47:56.837
IN THE ADDITIONAL MAN MADE AND

01:47:56.903 --> 01:47:58.438
NATURAL MORTALITY IT APPEARS

01:47:58.505 --> 01:48:00.173
THAT ONLY 122% OF THESE

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.275
ENDANGERED BABIES DEMONSTRATE

01:48:02.342 --> 01:48:03.143
JUST THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:05.111
THEIR LIVES. AND MIGRATE DOWN

01:48:05.178 --> 01:48:07.180
TO THE REQUEST THE REGION DAM

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:08.515
IN THE UPPER SACRAMENTO RIVER.

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:09.749
MEANS EVEN FEWER OF THEM WILL

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:11.218
SURVIVE THEIR MIGRATION DOWN

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:12.686
THE SACRAMENTO RIVER THROUGH

01:48:12.752 --> 01:48:13.954
THE DELTA THREE SAN FRANCISCO

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:16.656
BAY. AND THEN SPENDING TWO TO

01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:17.290
THREE YEARS IN THE OCEAN BEFORE

RETURNING TO SPAWN. THAT'S

01:48:18.658 --> 01:48:19.726
BECAUSE THE SCIENCE IS VERY

01:48:19.793 --> 01:48:22.963
CLEAR. THAT LOWER CLOSING THESE

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:23.463

01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:25.365
SURVIVING. AND IT'S NOT JUST

01:48:25.432 --> 01:48:27.234
THE ENDANGERED SALMON RUNS THIS

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.101

WHICH ARE STILL HERE THIS YEAR.

01:48:49.289 --> 01:48:50.690
BUT IS REALLY ALSO A FUNCTION

01:48:50.757 --> 01:48:51.791
OF OUR ANTIQUATED WATER RIGHT

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:53.093

FOR EXTENSION OF OUR SALMON

01:49:34.601 --> 01:49:35.669
RUNS. WHAT'S IS THAT THESE

01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:36.870
DECISIONS MEANS THAT CALIFORNIA

01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:38.738
HAVE EXTREMELY LOW WATER STORED

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:40.774

OCTOBER STORM WAS IMPRESSIVE IT

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:44.945
HARDLY MADE A DENT IN MOST OF

01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:55.021
LIKELY TO BE EVEN WORSE THIS

01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:56.823

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:59.492
DUE TO LEGAL WATER TEMPERATURES

01:49:59.559 --> 01:50:00.460

01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:02.095
INEVITABLE AND PERSONABLE AND

01:50:02.162 --> 01:50:03.596

OF DROUGHT OR NOW MORE SEVERE

01:50:06.599 --> 01:50:07.267

01:55:33.826 --> 01:55:35.528
BETWEEN. WHERE WE'RE AT NOW

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:37.430
STEPPING AWAY FROM THE

VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS IN THE

01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:40.566

HYDRAULIC IS GOING TO BE LIKE

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:51.811
NEXT YEAR. IT DOES NOT LOOK

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:52.378
GOOD AND AS A DIRECTOR NOTED

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:54.580
AND AS I NOTED. WE HAVE A HUGE

01:55:54.647 --> 01:55:56.149
DEFICIT IN TERMS OF RESERVOIR

01:55:56.215 --> 01:55:58.151
STORAGE- BECAUSE WE TRAIN THE

01:55:58.217 --> 01:56:00.320
RESERVOIRS TO MEET WATER

01:56:00.386 --> 01:56:02.155
DELIVERIES THIS YEAR. AND IT

01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:03.623
MEANS THAT IF NEXT YEAR IS DRY

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:05.258
AS PREDICTED. WE'RE LIKELY TO

01:56:05.325 --> 01:56:06.893
SEE ANOTHER TERRIBLE YEAR

01:56:06.959 --> 01:56:08.428
UNLESS WE CHANGE COURSE AND I

01:56:08.494 --> 01:56:09.696
THINK WE ARE STARTING TO SEE

01:56:09.762 --> 01:56:12.298
THAT- YOU KNOW. AS I MENTIONED

01:56:12.365 --> 01:56:12.899
THE STATE AND FEDERAL

01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:14.467
GOVERNMENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:15.935
INTERIM PROTECTIONS IN OUR

01:56:16.002 --> 01:56:18.137
FEDERAL COURT LITIGATION. WE'RE

01:56:18.204 --> 01:56:20.106
CONFIDENT THAT THOSE

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:23.076
PROTECTIONS DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH-

01:56:23.142 --> 01:56:23.676
AND THAT'S JUST FOR THIS NEXT

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:26.112
YEAR. YOU KNOW I THINK STEPPING

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:27.714
BACK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.948
RECOGNIZE THAT THE ENDANGERED

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:30.083
SPECIES ACT IS BEING INVOKED

01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:31.084
HERE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:33.453
FAILED TO UPHOLD ITS LEGAL

01:56:33.519 --> 01:56:35.488
OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT SALMON

01:56:35.555 --> 01:56:36.856
NOT JUST THE ENDANGERED RUNS

01:56:36.923 --> 01:56:38.157
BUT FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON AS

01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:39.592
WELL. AND THOSE BIOLOGICAL

01:56:39.659 --> 01:56:40.927
OPINIONS IN ESA PROTECTIONS

01:56:40.993 --> 01:56:42.762
DON'T PROTECT THE BALL RUN GET

01:56:42.829 --> 01:56:44.664
SOME INS INCIDENTAL ANCILLARY

01:56:44.731 --> 01:56:46.232
BENEFITS FROM PROTECTING THE

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:47.834
ENDANGERED GROUNDS BUT NOTHING

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:49.535
THAT'S FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON

01:56:49.602 --> 01:56:51.437
THAT AND THAT HAS TO CHANGE.

01:56:51.504 --> 01:56:52.538
YOU KNOW THAT IS THE STATE

01:56:52.605 --> 01:56:53.773
WATER BOARDS JOB THAT'S THE

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:54.741
CALIFORNIA APARTMENT FISHING

01:56:54.807 --> 01:56:57.009
GAMES JOB TO SAY WHAT IS

01:56:57.076 --> 01:56:59.145
NECESSARY TO PROTECT ALL SALMON

01:56:59.212 --> 01:57:00.279
RUNS NOT JUST THE ENDANGERED

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:02.382
RUNS AND I THINK YOU KNOW I AM

01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:03.449
OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:57:03.516 --> 01:57:05.017
SEE IMPROVE PROTECTIONS AND

01:57:05.084 --> 01:57:07.653
THEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE- THANKS

EFFORTS AND FRANKLY THE PURSUIT

01:57:20.566 --> 01:57:21.901
OF ONTARIO AGREEMENTS HAS

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:23.703
REALLY DELAYED THE STATE

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:25.471
BOARD'S ADOPTION OF MEANINGFUL

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:27.073
PROTECTIONS THAT WILL LAST NOT

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:28.941

PLEASANT TEMPERATURES IN ALL

01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:32.645
YEARS BECAUSE AS A DIRECTOR

01:57:32.712 --> 01:57:34.080
SAID WE CAN'T JUST PROTECT THEM

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:35.782
IN THE DROUGHTS AND LET THEM

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:36.983

CAN'T LOSE THEM AND IT ROUTES

01:57:38.418 --> 01:57:39.819
AND THEN PRETEND LIKE THE OTHER

01:57:39.886 --> 01:57:40.353

IS OCCURRING RIGHT NOW AND WHAT

01:58:07.713 --> 01:58:09.449
IT MEANS TO ME IS EVEN IF IT

01:58:09.515 --> 01:58:10.650

COMING DOWN THE SACRAMENTO

01:58:15.054 --> 01:58:17.590
RIVER NEXT SPRING BECAUSE

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:18.157
YOU'RE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO

01:58:18.224 --> 01:58:21.394
SURVIVE- OUT OF THE GRAVEL OUR

01:58:21.461 --> 01:58:23.663

CREEK THIS YEAR IN REALLY GOOD

01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:31.170
NUMBERS ACTUALLY- MOST OF THEM

01:58:31.237 --> 01:58:32.905
DIED PRIOR TO BEING ABLE TO

01:58:32.972 --> 01:58:34.674
SPOT BECAUSE OF HOT WATER.

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:37.210
HOWEVER SOME SURVIVED YEAH I

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:38.411
THINK IT WOULD BE WHO BOASTS OF

01:58:38.478 --> 01:58:40.112
THE DEPARTMENT WOULD GET WITH

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:42.648
THE WATER RESOURCES BOARD AND

01:58:42.715 --> 01:58:44.784
PREPARE FOR CURTAILMENTS. OF

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:46.886

CREEK AND DOWN THE SACRAMENTO

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.329
RIVER TO THE OCEAN SO THAT

01:58:56.395 --> 01:58:59.398
pANOTHER POINT I WOULD JUST LIKE

01:58:59.465 --> 01:59:01.234
TO VISIT- DOUG MENTION THE

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:03.302
TEMPORARY URGENCY CHANGE

01:59:03.369 --> 01:59:05.638
PETITIONS THESE ARE THE- THE

01:59:05.705 --> 01:59:07.940
PETITIONS. BASICALLY THAT THE

01:59:08.007 --> 01:59:10.076
WATER DIVERTERS TAKE TO THE

01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:10.977
STATE WATER BOARD GET RUBBER

01:59:11.043 --> 01:59:13.012
STAMPED WHETHER THEY NEED TO

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:16.182
VIOLATE- WATER RULES AS FAR AS

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:18.184
I CAN TELL THE WATER BOARD HAS

01:59:18.251 --> 01:59:19.752
BEEN APPROVING THESE THINGS

01:59:19.819 --> 01:59:20.853
WITH BASICALLY LITTLE OR NO

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:24.457
COST TO THE WATER CONTRACTORS.

01:59:24.524 --> 01:59:26.325
WHAT WAS THE COST ASSOCIATED

01:59:26.392 --> 01:59:26.959

GOING TO COST YOU SOMETHING IT

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:32.665
SEEMS TO ME THAT MIGHT GIVE

01:59:32.732 --> 01:59:34.100
SOME PAUSE TO THE WATER

01:59:34.166 --> 01:59:35.568
CONTRACTORS TO MAKE THEM THINK

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:37.370
THROUGH HOW OFTEN THEY WANT TO

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:39.071
GO BACK TO THE WELL AND ASKED

01:59:39.138 --> 01:59:40.706

MYSELF BECAUSE I SEEN THAT HAS

02:06:09.461 --> 02:06:10.296
THE BEST SKILL. THE BEST

02:06:10.362 --> 02:06:12.231
ACCURACY OVER THE YEARS AS I

02:06:12.298 --> 02:06:14.767
VALIDATE THIS AND SO- I JUST

02:06:14.833 --> 02:06:16.001
WANNA POINT OUT THESE MODELS

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:17.870
HEAVILY RELY ON STUDENTS AND

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:19.204

ARTS YOU WANT SOME TRACTOR.

02:06:27.713 --> 02:06:28.981
EARLIER ABOUT THAT YOU SHOULD

THERE'S A CRYSTAL BALL PARK-

02:06:36.956 --> 02:06:37.990
AND THIS IS THE PART WHERE I

02:06:38.057 --> 02:06:39.391
REALLY HOPE THE MODEL HAS ZERO

02:06:39.458 --> 02:06:40.693
SKILL. BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN

02:06:40.759 --> 02:06:42.361

02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:45.297
WHEN I LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT

02:06:45.364 --> 02:06:47.499
CELLULAR. CASTED IT SHOWS. HOT

02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:49.368
SPOT HOT SPOT HOT SPOT ONLY FOR

02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:50.903
THE NORTH COAST MEANING KIND OF

02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:51.804
MINUTES YOU KNOW COUNTY AND

02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:53.872
WORKS ON- AND I. I HOPE THAT

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:55.007
THAT'S NOT TRUE AND I DON'T

02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:56.208
KNOW WHAT IT MEANS ABSOLUTELY

02:06:56.275 --> 02:06:58.310
YES. BUT IT IS. NOT A GOOD

02:06:58.377 --> 02:07:00.713
SIGN. GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT

02:07:00.779 --> 02:07:02.081
THE DEMO GASES THAT IS ON THE

02:07:02.147 --> 02:07:03.716
SURFACE WATERS DOES MAKE ITS

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:10.356
WAY INTO THE VENT THOSE. TRAPS.

02:07:10.422 --> 02:07:10.956
IF IT'S THERE FOR A LONG. TIME

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:11.890
ON THIS IS IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU

02:07:11.957 --> 02:07:13.692
GO THERE. CLOSE WATCH. ON THEIR-

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:14.727
THAT. WHAT YOU SEE THIS IS THE

02:07:14.793 --> 02:07:15.527
KEY. OF DEAL OUTPUT YOU WOULD

02:07:15.594 --> 02:07:17.229
GET. ON WITH THE WARMER COLORS.

02:07:17.296 --> 02:07:19.465
HIGHER RISKS. OKAY SO THE NEXT

02:07:19.531 --> 02:07:21.166
THING WE'RE DOING- I'VE BEEN

02:07:21.233 --> 02:07:22.768
PUTTING THIS OUT THROUGH SCREWS

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:23.769
FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW I JUST

02:07:23.836 --> 02:07:24.570
WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE

02:07:24.636 --> 02:07:26.038
KNOWS ABOUT IT. YOU WANT TO GET

02:07:26.105 --> 02:07:27.306
ON THE LIST SERVICES PRETTY

02:07:27.373 --> 02:07:28.674
NICE THING IT'S NOT A FORWARD

02:07:28.741 --> 02:07:30.409
LOOKING THING PRINCIPLES AND IT

02:07:30.476 --> 02:07:32.144
GIVES YOU A RETROSPECTIVE. WHAT

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:33.612
DID THE C. HER MODEL SAY LAST

02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:35.647
MONTH- WHAT DID. WHAT HAPPENED

02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:36.915
REVEALS YOU'RE GETTING DATA.

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:38.317
EVERY MARINE MAMMAL STRANDING

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:39.318
CENTER. BUT IN TERMS OF

02:07:39.385 --> 02:07:41.120
FISHERIES WE GET. AS MUCH DATA

02:07:41.186 --> 02:07:43.322
AS WE CAN FROM C. PH AND WE HOT

02:07:43.389 --> 02:07:45.157
MEXICAN. FISHERIES DATA. BUT IT

02:07:45.224 --> 02:07:46.358
GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT.

02:07:46.425 --> 02:07:48.060
THEIR SAMPLING LOOKS LIKE AND

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:49.028
THE HOPE IS THAT WELL THERE'S

02:07:49.094 --> 02:07:50.763
NOT A LOT OF. FISH SPECIES IN

02:07:50.829 --> 02:07:52.231
HERE EXCEPT FOR THE BEAT WE

02:07:52.297 --> 02:07:53.432
WILL INSTALL THE ADVISORIES FOR

02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:55.000
THE STATE. WHAT IT DOES DO IS

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:56.468
HELP OU CALIBRATE WHAT THIS

02:07:56.535 --> 02:07:57.669
MODEL LOOKS LIKE RELATIVES

02:07:57.736 --> 02:07:58.504
ANYTHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

02:07:58.570 --> 02:08:00.606
THE SPATIAL- REGION YOU'RE

02:08:00.672 --> 02:08:02.574
INTERESTED IN TIME SKILLS. AND

02:08:02.641 --> 02:08:03.742
HELP YOU FIGURE OUT WHETHER

02:08:03.809 --> 02:08:05.344
THIS MODEL IS. WORKING FOR YOU

02:08:05.411 --> 02:08:06.678
OR NOT DOES IT REFLECT THE

02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:09.815
REALITY THAT YOU SEE ON THE

02:08:09.882 --> 02:08:10.983
GROUND OR DOES IT- SO THIS IS A

02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:12.851
PRETTY COOL TOOL- WHAT WE'RE

02:08:12.918 --> 02:08:16.355
TRYING TO DO TO. FULL

02:08:16.422 --> 02:08:18.791
INSTRUMENTS FUNDED BY. SECTION

02:08:18.857 --> 02:08:19.725
COUNCIL WE'RE GETTING THESE

02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:22.094
ROBOTIC. MICROSCOPES COMMITTING

02:08:22.161 --> 02:08:23.662
SUICIDE ABOUT. EVERY PEER IN

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:25.397
THE STATE INCLUDING TRINIDAD

02:08:25.464 --> 02:08:28.333
HERE SOON- BUT A GUY HAS AN

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.701
INTAKE. AT THEIR MARINE LAB

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:31.470
THAT WILL BE USING. BUT THESE

02:08:31.537 --> 02:08:32.871
TELL YOU IN REAL TIME EVERY

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:34.306
THIRTY MINUTES. USING MACHINE

02:08:34.373 --> 02:08:35.507
LEARNING KIND OF FACIAL

02:08:35.574 --> 02:08:36.542
RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS FOR THE

02:08:36.608 --> 02:08:38.644
CLINTON. WHAT'S THERE NOT

02:08:38.710 --> 02:08:40.913
TOXINS BUT IT TELLS YOU. WHAT

02:08:40.979 --> 02:08:42.448
IS THERE EVERY THIRTY MINUTES

02:08:42.514 --> 02:08:44.049
SO YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING IS

02:08:44.116 --> 02:08:46.452
RAMPING UP OR RAMPING DOWN- AND

02:08:46.518 --> 02:08:48.087
IT WILL BE CO LOCATED WITH ALL

02:08:48.153 --> 02:08:49.254
KINDS OF OTHER SENSORS TO TELL

02:08:49.321 --> 02:08:50.856
US WHETHER. OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

02:08:50.923 --> 02:08:52.791
IS ALSO PLAYING A ROLE AND I'M-

02:08:52.858 --> 02:08:55.727
THE INCREASE OR DECREASE OF

02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:56.361
CERTAIN SPECIES. WE'RE HOPING

02:08:56.428 --> 02:08:57.529
THIS IS GONNA BE REVOLUTIONARY

02:08:57.596 --> 02:08:58.764
FOR THE MODELING THE MODELING

02:08:58.831 --> 02:08:59.631
WE'RE PUSHING FORWARD IN A

02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:01.133
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS ONE IS

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:02.835
THE KIND OF MECHANISTIC FIRST

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:04.403
PRINCIPLES HOW WIDE IS DOING

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:06.505
OKAY AWESOME. PRODUCTION HAPPEN

02:09:06.572 --> 02:09:07.773
WHAT TURNS IT ON. TRYING TO

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.741
MAKE THAT HAPPEN THROUGH MODELS

02:09:09.808 --> 02:09:10.909
USING THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELS

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:12.044
BUT THEN ALSO SOMETHING THAT I

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:13.112
STARTED WORKING ON IN SANTA

02:09:13.178 --> 02:09:14.580
CRUZ WE'RE NOW DOING THIS WITH

02:09:14.646 --> 02:09:15.647
THE UCLA TEAM BUT TRYING TO

02:09:15.714 --> 02:09:17.349
GET. THAT FIRST PRINCIPLE

02:09:17.416 --> 02:09:18.951
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW NUTRIENTS

02:09:19.017 --> 02:09:20.752
OR STOMACH ACID PRODUCTION INTO

02:09:20.819 --> 02:09:22.821
THESE MODELS. WE MORE REALISTIC

02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:25.057
PREDICTIONS NOT OUT PRIME TIME

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:26.091
YET BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSER

02:09:26.158 --> 02:09:27.826
AND CLOSER. WE CAN ALSO THINK

02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:29.194
AROUND WITH THE INTERACTIONS

02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:30.262
WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

02:09:30.329 --> 02:09:31.930
HYPOXIA AND MODELS LIKE THIS

02:09:31.997 --> 02:09:35.100
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS KIND

02:09:35.167 --> 02:09:35.968
OF MODEL PARTICULARLY COOL. SH

02:09:36.034 --> 02:09:36.869
THE OTHER THING WE'RE DOING

02:09:36.935 --> 02:09:38.370
THIS ACTUALLY WILL BE PROBABLY

02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:39.838
THE COOLEST OF ALL OF THIS WHEN

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:40.806
IT COMES TO IMPROVING THE

02:09:40.873 --> 02:09:42.674
MODELS WHICH IS. NOW THAT- A

02:09:42.741 --> 02:09:44.676
GROUP HERE STRIPS. DISCOVER THE

02:09:44.743 --> 02:09:46.311
GENETIC BASIS FOR DINNER GAS

02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:48.247
PRODUCTION WE CAN TAKE A LOT

02:09:48.313 --> 02:09:49.414
ALL OF OUR INSTRUMENTATION AND

02:09:49.481 --> 02:09:50.182
GO OUT INTO THE FIELD AND

02:09:50.249 --> 02:09:52.017
ACTUALLY LOOK. WHEN THIS NEW

02:09:52.084 --> 02:09:53.485
TRAIN GOES UP DOES THAT GENE

02:09:53.552 --> 02:09:55.587
TURN ON- AND THEN THAT WILL

02:09:55.654 --> 02:09:56.822
GIVE US THE SKILL WE NEED

02:09:56.889 --> 02:09:58.090
MOVING FORWARD WE CAN CONTINUE

02:09:58.157 --> 02:09:59.525
TO DO THOSE MEASUREMENTS. AND

02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:00.926
PARAMETRIZED MODELS BETTER THAN

02:10:00.993 --> 02:10:02.895
WE CAN REALLY SAY ON THESE ARE

02:10:02.961 --> 02:10:04.096
THE CONDITIONS THAT TURN THIS

02:10:04.163 --> 02:10:05.664
ON IS THAT TELLS WHAT HAPPENS

02:10:05.731 --> 02:10:07.432
TO THE ANIMALS. IT ALSO HAPPENS

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:09.334
TO CRAB NO AND THAT'S THE PART

02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:10.769
WHERE I THINK THAT'S OUR

02:10:10.836 --> 02:10:13.105
ACHILLES HEEL. WE HAVE A GROUP

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:14.273
OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TRYING TO

02:10:14.339 --> 02:10:15.841
TACKLE THIS USING AGAIN MACHINE

02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:17.409
LEARNING. AND THE APPROACH HERE

02:10:17.476 --> 02:10:19.178
HAS BEEN REALLY PRACTICAL TAKE

02:10:19.244 --> 02:10:23.715
THE C. HARM OUTPUT IT SAYS THIS.

02:10:23.782 --> 02:10:24.283
IS THE RISK FOR DEMOCRATS IN

02:10:24.349 --> 02:10:24.917
THE WATER. I THEN TAKE ALL OF

02:10:24.983 --> 02:10:26.151
THE- WE HAVE FOR TOMORROW.

02:10:26.218 --> 02:10:27.152
ROUTES AND ALL THESE OTHER.

02:10:27.219 --> 02:10:29.421
SPECIES ON ROCK CLUB. STREET IS

02:10:29.488 --> 02:10:31.223
YOUR CLAIMS YOU NAME IT. AND

02:10:31.290 --> 02:10:32.824
TRY TO CONSTRAIN STATISTICALLY

02:10:32.891 --> 02:10:34.526
HOW DO YOU GET FROM THOSE IN

02:10:34.593 --> 02:10:36.595
WATER CONCENTRATIONS OR RISK

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:38.764
ASSESSMENTS. TO THE RISK FOR

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:40.999
THE ANIMALS- I KNEW THESE PLOTS

02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:42.501
ARE TINY THEY'RE HARD TO READ

02:10:42.568 --> 02:10:43.468
BUT ON THE RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE

02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:45.204
SEEING IS. IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:46.371
WE DO THAT AND WHAT DOES IT

02:10:46.438 --> 02:10:47.739
LOOK LIKE FOR DUNGENESS CRAB

02:10:47.806 --> 02:10:49.841
ANOTHER SPECIES. THROUGH SPACE

02:10:49.908 --> 02:10:51.376
AND TIME WE HAVEN'T PUBLISHED

02:10:51.443 --> 02:10:53.312
THIS YET. IT'S NOT OPERATIONAL

02:10:53.378 --> 02:10:55.547
MODEL YET. BUT IT LOOKS PRETTY

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:56.848
GOOD AND I THINK THIS IS THE

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:57.983
NEXT THING ON THE HORIZON FOR

02:10:58.050 --> 02:10:59.484
US TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE-

02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:01.353
HOW DO WE MOVE TOWARDS. WHAT WE

02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:02.788
CARE ABOUT WHICH IS THE FISHERY

02:11:02.854 --> 02:11:04.790
SPECIES. THIRTY SECONDS. I'M

02:11:04.856 --> 02:11:06.425
PRETTY MUCH DONE I THINK SO I

02:11:06.491 --> 02:11:08.193
JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT.

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.595
ALL OF THESE TOGETHER ARE IN

02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:11.230
OUR TOOLBOX NONE OF NONE OF

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:12.264
THESE THINGS ALONE IS GOING TO

02:11:12.331 --> 02:11:13.332
GIVE US THE ANSWERS THAT WE

02:11:13.398 --> 02:11:15.167
NEED BUT I THINK. WE WANT TO

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:15.767
REALLY GOOD CRYSTAL BALL WE

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:17.302
HAVE TO TACKLE THIS. FROM ALL

02:11:17.369 --> 02:11:18.870
DIFFERENT ANGLES SO THAT'S IT

02:11:18.937 --> 02:11:19.471
AND THESE ARE ALL OUR FUNDING

02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:21.306
SOURCES AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:25.477

MIGRATING UP FOR COACH IT IS

02:14:09.207 --> 02:14:10.375
HARD TO SEE HOW THE RARE

INTERACTION WITH COMMERCIAL

02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:13.678
DUNGENESS CRAB HERE WHICH

02:14:20.786 --> 02:14:22.954
FLEXIBILITY INTO THE RAFFLES IF

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:24.623
SO THEY SHOULD BE DOING

02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:26.024
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO FIGURE

02:14:26.091 --> 02:14:27.993

02:14:35.767 --> 02:14:36.701
PERMISSION TO RAISE THE LEVEL

02:14:36.768 --> 02:14:38.637

WHEN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

02:14:46.978 --> 02:14:48.680

TO REDUCE COSTS IS SUCH

02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:52.290
ATTAINMENTS. WOULD BE TO

02:23:52.357 --> 02:23:53.558

FISHERY. AND ENTANGLEMENT

02:23:58.730 --> 02:23:59.230
SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO. WHY

02:23:59.297 --> 02:24:00.164
PROBLEM IS THAT NTANGLEMENTS

02:24:00.231 --> 02:24:01.132
DON'T ALWAYS HAVE BLUES WHICH

02:24:01.199 --> 02:24:02.200
CAN BE USEFUL IN IDENTIFYING

02:24:02.266 --> 02:24:04.102
THE CULPRIT. OTHER STATES ARE

02:24:04.168 --> 02:24:05.103

COULD BE USEFUL IN CALIFORNIA.

02:24:08.506 --> 02:24:09.207

THE TOTAL COST OF THAT WILL

02:31:47.465 --> 02:31:49.266

02:37:10.888 --> 02:37:12.723
YEAR I THINK THAT IS THERE'S A-

02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:14.458
THERE'S A LOOPHOLE IN

02:37:14.525 --> 02:37:15.559
ESPECIALLY WHEN STAKES ARE SO

02:37:15.626 --> 02:37:19.029
HIGH- IF A MARINE MAMMAL IS

02:37:19.096 --> 02:37:21.098
ENTANGLED. IN THEY CAN'T FIGURE

02:37:21.165 --> 02:37:22.466
OUT WHERE IT CAME FROM IT

02:37:22.533 --> 02:37:23.200
AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN THE

02:37:23.267 --> 02:37:24.902
FISHERY MR CONROY THEY'LL GO TO

02:37:24.968 --> 02:37:27.337

WE'RE ALL WORKING ON. TO BE

02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:32.743
ABLE TO GET THIS THING FIXED.

THANKS FOR THAT. QUESTION THE

02:37:35.078 --> 02:37:36.914
CENTER REQUIRE IT IT IS A BIG

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:39.316
PROBLEM AND HOPEFULLY WITH A

02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:41.685
YEAH. BUT THE NEXT VERSION OF

02:37:41.752 --> 02:37:43.120

UPDATED SCIENCE IN TERMS OF THE

02:37:47.324 --> 02:37:48.325
NUMBERS OF WELLS THAT ARE

02:37:48.392 --> 02:37:50.360

RECENTLY YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS

02:37:55.566 --> 02:37:57.234

ACTUALLY BE REDUCED AND GIVEN

02:37:59.536 --> 02:38:01.138
THAT HOPEFULLY THE IMPACT THAT

02:38:01.205 --> 02:38:03.674
IT HAS ON. THE CRAB FISHERY

02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:07.044
WILL BE REDUCED AS WELL- IT'S

02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:08.512
ONE OF THOSE UNFORTUNATE

02:38:08.579 --> 02:38:10.147
RESULTS AND I THINK YOU KNOW

02:38:10.214 --> 02:38:11.615
THE DEPARTMENT IS SHE HAS BEEN

02:38:11.682 --> 02:38:13.016
WILLING TO WORK WITH THE

02:38:13.083 --> 02:38:14.318
WORKING GROUP IN TERMS OF

02:38:14.384 --> 02:38:15.886
LOOKING AT THOSE UNKNOWN

02:38:15.953 --> 02:38:19.990
ENTANGLEMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO.

02:38:20.057 --> 02:38:21.325
IF WE CAN'T RULE OUT. THE DEEP

02:38:21.391 --> 02:38:22.693
CRAP FISHERY AS A POTENTIAL

02:38:22.759 --> 02:38:24.695
CULPRIT THEN THAT WON'T COUNT

02:38:24.761 --> 02:38:26.830
AGAINST YOU CRABTREE. AND WE

02:38:26.897 --> 02:38:28.699
SAW THAT WITH A SPERM WHALE

02:38:28.765 --> 02:38:30.300
THAT WAS ENTANGLED I THINK IT

02:38:30.367 --> 02:38:32.035
WAS IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY.

02:38:32.102 --> 02:38:33.470
DOT UP SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST

02:38:33.537 --> 02:38:35.839
JUST LOOKING AT THE PICTURES OF

02:38:35.906 --> 02:38:37.674
THE OFFENDING HERE ITSELF YOU

02:38:37.741 --> 02:38:39.076
CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT IT WAS

02:38:39.142 --> 02:38:41.178
MONOFILAMENT BASED AND COULD

02:38:41.245 --> 02:38:41.812
NOT HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE

02:38:41.879 --> 02:38:43.947
DUNGEONS CRABTREE. SO THAT ONE

02:38:44.014 --> 02:38:45.249
EVEN THOUGH IT REMAINS UNKNOWN

02:38:45.315 --> 02:38:47.017
WAS NOT DID NOT COUNT AGAINST

02:38:47.084 --> 02:38:48.518
THE G. TROUT FISHERY SO.

02:38:48.585 --> 02:38:50.787
ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO. FURTHER

02:38:50.854 --> 02:38:52.155
VET THESE UNDER UNTANGLE

02:38:52.222 --> 02:38:56.326
INCENTIVE POSSIBLE. RULE OUT

02:38:56.393 --> 02:38:56.927
THE DEPRESSED FISHERY ALL THE

02:38:56.994 --> 02:38:59.363
BETTER. THANK YOU M. S. FIVE.

02:38:59.429 --> 02:39:01.498
YEAH I WOULD- ECHO WHAT WHAT

02:39:01.565 --> 02:39:05.736
MIKE HAS TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND-

02:39:05.802 --> 02:39:07.638
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST GLARING

02:39:07.704 --> 02:39:08.972
PROBLEMS WITH THE ORIGINAL

02:39:09.039 --> 02:39:11.608
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT- WHICH

02:39:11.675 --> 02:39:13.477
INCLUDED A CHARGE FOR

02:39:13.543 --> 02:39:15.746
UNIDENTIFIED TYPE CONTAINMENT

02:39:15.812 --> 02:39:18.949
SO- GIVEN THAT DATA MEETING TO

02:39:19.016 --> 02:39:21.218
RAP OR WE'RE HAVING TO TRY TO

02:39:21.285 --> 02:39:24.087
FIGURE OUT HOW TO- CORRECT THAT

02:39:24.154 --> 02:39:25.956
ISSUE BECAUSE IT CAN SERIOUSLY

02:39:26.023 --> 02:39:29.359
LIMIT THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY

02:39:29.426 --> 02:39:31.128
FOR NO GOOD REASON. THE WAY IT

02:39:31.194 --> 02:39:33.130
STANDS RIGHT NOW I WOULD LIKE

02:39:33.196 --> 02:39:33.897
TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME

02:39:33.964 --> 02:39:37.801
LEFT TO MENTION THAT THE OTHER

02:39:37.868 --> 02:39:39.036
PIECE OF THIS YEAR'S. D. THE

02:39:39.102 --> 02:39:40.137
FISHERY IS ALREADY DOING A

02:39:40.203 --> 02:39:41.538
REALLY GOOD JOB OF CLEANING UP

02:39:41.605 --> 02:39:43.340
THEIR OWN HERE HERE THAT COULD

02:39:43.407 --> 02:39:45.442
LATER BECOME AN IDENTIFIABLE

02:39:45.509 --> 02:39:47.344
BECAUSE OF MONSTER MOVIES OR-

02:39:47.411 --> 02:39:48.412
MOVIES THAT HAVE BEEN BROKEN

02:39:48.478 --> 02:39:54.051
OFF FOR- SUBMERGED- GEAR. SO-

02:39:54.117 --> 02:39:55.886
INITIALLY AND EVEN MORE SO

02:39:55.953 --> 02:39:57.888
TODAY WE ARE IN THE HABIT OF

02:39:57.955 --> 02:40:00.824
BRINGING IN ANY ABOUT IT- THAT

02:40:00.891 --> 02:40:02.059
WE SEE WHILE WE'RE FISHING

02:40:02.125 --> 02:40:04.227
DURING THE SEASON AFTER ALWAYS

02:40:04.294 --> 02:40:05.062
BEING BROUGHT TO THE DOCTOR IN

02:40:05.128 --> 02:40:07.731
SEASON. BY CRAP ABOUT SOULS AND

02:40:07.798 --> 02:40:09.666
PEOPLE OR PEOPLE THAT ON THE

02:40:09.733 --> 02:40:11.068
CRAB TRAPS GET CALLED IN THE

02:40:11.134 --> 02:40:12.736
COMING PICK UP THEIR EAR. AT

02:40:12.803 --> 02:40:14.838
THE END OF THE SEASON- I THINK

02:40:14.905 --> 02:40:16.606
FOR THE LAST MAYBE FIVE OR SIX

02:40:16.673 --> 02:40:18.642
YEARS NOW- THE NATURE

02:40:18.709 --> 02:40:20.577
CONSERVANCY AND OTHER HAPPEN

02:40:20.644 --> 02:40:23.480
BABY ASSOCIATION WERE PARTNERED

02:40:23.547 --> 02:40:27.351
IN A LOST YEAR RECOVERY PROGRAM.

02:40:27.417 --> 02:40:28.952
IT STARTED AND HOW BASED SIX.

02:40:29.019 --> 02:40:31.021
IN SPANISH AS SAN FRANCISCO.

02:40:31.088 --> 02:40:32.723
BAY AND FURTHER NORTH. AND

02:40:32.789 --> 02:40:34.424
HOUSE OF LAST YEAR- ARE

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:36.827
ASSOCIATION BEGAN TO SPONSOR

02:40:36.893 --> 02:40:39.997
THAT- IT'S STILL STATEWIDE

02:40:40.063 --> 02:40:42.065
CONDOMINIUMS IN INFANCY BUT-

02:40:42.132 --> 02:40:43.967
THE IDEA IS THAT AS SOON AS THE

02:40:44.034 --> 02:40:46.136
SEASON IS OVER WE HAVE-

02:40:46.203 --> 02:40:48.138
RETRIEVAL TEAMS IN EVERY PORT.

02:40:48.205 --> 02:40:50.374
EASTER GUYS THAT ARE HIRED TO-

02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:52.442
GO OUT AND GET PAID FOR EVERY

02:40:52.509 --> 02:40:54.578
LOSS HOT THAT THEY FIND SO

02:40:54.644 --> 02:40:57.681
WE'RE DOING. ALMOST A 100% YOUR

02:40:57.748 --> 02:41:00.217
RECOVERY NOW THERE'S VIRTUALLY

02:41:00.283 --> 02:41:03.086
NO LOST YEAR- AS AS LONG AS WE

02:41:03.153 --> 02:41:04.421
CONTINUE TO BE ALLOWED TO GO

02:41:04.488 --> 02:41:05.922
OUT AND GET THESE PARTS AND

02:41:05.989 --> 02:41:06.623
THEY WILL I BELIEVE IT'LL

02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:08.291
IMPROVE EVERY YEAR. I WOULD

02:41:08.358 --> 02:41:10.394
LIKE TO SEE THAT BE A- THE NEXT

02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:12.262
PRIORITY FOR THE STATE IN TERMS

02:41:12.329 --> 02:41:14.798
OF CRACK HERE IS. IS FINDING

02:41:14.865 --> 02:41:17.634
MORE FUNDING AVAILABLE- FOR

02:41:17.701 --> 02:41:18.602
THESE LOST YOUR RECOVERY

02:41:18.668 --> 02:41:20.170
PROGRAMS SHOULD NOT BE THE

02:41:20.237 --> 02:41:21.571
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATURE

02:41:21.638 --> 02:41:23.540
CONSERVANCY. AT A LOCAL

02:41:23.607 --> 02:41:25.375
ASSOCIATIONS- DURCH DIE THIS

02:41:25.442 --> 02:41:27.477
SUCH A BIG ISSUE THE LAST YEAR

02:41:27.544 --> 02:41:30.614
BUT TO ACTUALLY DIED. IT IS- IT

02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:32.282
IS LITERALLY OUR JOB TO CLEAN

02:41:32.349 --> 02:41:33.550
UP OUR SIDE OF THE STREET. WE

02:41:33.617 --> 02:41:36.253
ARE MOTIVATED TO DO THAT- BUT

02:41:36.319 --> 02:41:37.521
IT WOULD REALLY HELP IF THE

02:41:37.587 --> 02:41:38.955
STATE WOULD GET BEHIND IT AND

02:41:39.022 --> 02:41:40.791
WE COULD HAVE MORE CONSISTENCY

02:41:40.857 --> 02:41:43.026
IN THAT EFFORT. AND BE ABLE TO

02:41:43.093 --> 02:41:44.661
GET YOU A 100% OF YOUR

02:41:44.728 --> 02:41:46.396

CALIFORNIANS REALLY DIDN'T HEAR

02:42:05.248 --> 02:42:07.217
ABOUT DEMO CASSIDY AND DEMO

02:42:07.284 --> 02:42:10.353
CASTED. THE CHALLENGES THE DEMO

IN WHY IS IT SUCH A FORCE NOW-

02:42:38.048 --> 02:42:40.083
WHEN IT COMES TO THE FISHER.

02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:41.184
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'LL TRY

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:43.553
TO BE QUICK- BECAUSE IT'S A BIG

02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:44.988
ONE AND YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN

02:42:45.055 --> 02:42:46.790
AROUND A LONG TIME. SIGNATURES

02:42:46.857 --> 02:42:47.958
AND NATURALLY OCCURRING DIET

02:42:48.024 --> 02:42:50.193
TIME IN OUR SYSTEM. IT'S HARDLY

02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:52.095
NEW- THERE'S A INTERESTING

02:42:52.162 --> 02:42:54.831
EVIDENCE THAT SOMEWHERE IN. THE

02:42:54.898 --> 02:42:56.466
EARLY NINETIES IT DID SORT OF

02:42:56.533 --> 02:42:57.934
TURN ON AND MUCH HIGHER

02:42:58.001 --> 02:42:59.803
ABUNDANCE THAN IT USED TO BE

02:42:59.870 --> 02:43:01.571
ALTHOUGH THIS THIS STILL STANDS

02:43:01.638 --> 02:43:03.507
FOR DEBATE- BUT WE HAVE LOOKED

02:43:03.573 --> 02:43:05.208
AT. TIMES OR IS IT THE MOST

02:43:05.275 --> 02:43:07.177
ACCESS TO THE BEST WE CAN IN

02:43:07.244 --> 02:43:08.445
LIKES YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK IN

02:43:08.512 --> 02:43:09.312
THE SEDIMENTS AND SEDIMENT

02:43:09.379 --> 02:43:10.413
TRAPS AND GET THE DEMO LIKE

02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:12.315
ACID OUT OF THEM. AND WE'VE

02:43:12.382 --> 02:43:13.650
DONE THAT AND SEEN IT REALLY

02:43:13.717 --> 02:43:16.786
DOES RAMP UP AROUND THE YEAR

02:43:16.853 --> 02:43:17.387
TWO THOUSAND NINE I KNOW WHAT

02:43:17.454 --> 02:43:18.588
YOU'RE SAYING IT SEEMS LIKE TEN

02:43:18.655 --> 02:43:19.189
YEARS AGO WAS WHEN WE REALLY

02:43:19.256 --> 02:43:20.657
STARTED HEARING ABOUT IT. IT

02:43:20.724 --> 02:43:21.224
WAS REALLY THE BLOGGING YOU

02:43:21.291 --> 02:43:23.193
START HEARING ABOUT IT BUT- IT

02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:24.528
WAS A PROBLEM AND THEY WERE HOT

02:43:24.594 --> 02:43:26.062
SPOTS IN OUR CHANNEL WAS ALWAYS

02:43:26.129 --> 02:43:27.130
A BIG HOT SPOT AND THAT'S WHERE

02:43:27.197 --> 02:43:28.698
I STARTED WORKING ON IT- YOU

02:43:28.765 --> 02:43:30.467
CAN GO BACK TO THE NINETIES AND

02:43:30.534 --> 02:43:31.601
EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AND SEE

02:43:31.668 --> 02:43:33.336
SOME DRAMATIC CASES OF BIRD AND

02:43:33.403 --> 02:43:35.438
SEEN THEM ALL. WE'RE TELLING

02:43:35.505 --> 02:43:36.173
THE EVENTS OKAY SO THAT BEING

02:43:36.239 --> 02:43:38.308
SAID. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN

02:43:38.375 --> 02:43:40.010
TIME WHAT WE STARTED TO NOTICE

02:43:40.076 --> 02:43:40.877
IN THIS TIME SERIES WAS THAT

02:43:40.944 --> 02:43:43.413
WHERE IT USED TO BE THREE TO

02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:44.147
FOUR YEAR OCCURRENCE NOW IT'S

02:43:44.214 --> 02:43:46.183
EVERY SINGLE YEAR. YOU CAN

02:43:46.249 --> 02:43:47.184
COUNT ON IT FOR THE MOST PART

02:43:47.250 --> 02:43:49.386
SOMEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND

02:43:49.452 --> 02:43:51.021
WHY THAT IS WE'RE NOT A 100%

02:43:51.087 --> 02:43:52.355
SURE BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A LOT

02:43:52.422 --> 02:43:53.423
OF DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING

02:43:53.490 --> 02:43:55.258
NOT JUST TEMPERATURE. BUT THE

02:43:55.325 --> 02:43:56.893
WAY THAT THE NUTRIENT CHEMISTRY

02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:59.329
HAS CHANGED IN THE OCEAN AND-

02:43:59.396 --> 02:44:05.535
THAT NUTRI CHEMISTRY CHANGES IN.

02:44:05.602 --> 02:44:06.036
RESPONSE TO LARGE SCALE

02:44:06.102 --> 02:44:06.736
PATTERNS. THE R. CAN. TO ITS-

02:44:06.803 --> 02:44:08.705
IN. PACIFIC CAN BELIEVE. SO

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:10.040
THESE ARE PATTERNS THAT CHANGED

02:44:10.106 --> 02:44:12.709
WHEN- WHEN CIRCULATION PATTERNS

02:44:12.776 --> 02:44:14.878
CHANGE OVER A LARGE AREA LIKE

02:44:14.945 --> 02:44:17.047
THE PACIFIC AND NORTH PACIFIC-

02:44:17.113 --> 02:44:18.381
WHY THAT WOULD BE WELL THERE'S

02:44:18.448 --> 02:44:19.783
A LOT OF HYPOTHESES OUT THERE

02:44:19.849 --> 02:44:22.152
ABOUT HOW IT DOES. CONNECT BACK

02:44:22.219 --> 02:44:23.887
TO THE BIGGER GLOBAL PROBLEM OF

02:44:23.954 --> 02:44:26.089
CLIMATE CHANGE- THE EXACT

02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:27.657
MECHANISMS FOR HOW WE END UP

02:44:27.724 --> 02:44:29.593
WITH THE DIFFERENT- KIND OF

02:44:29.659 --> 02:44:31.428
NUTRIENT WATER THAT FUELS ARE

02:44:31.494 --> 02:44:32.162
APPALLING IS DIFFERENT IT'S

02:44:32.229 --> 02:44:34.698
HARD TO SAY. SO WE ARE HOMING

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:35.498
IN ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:44:35.565 --> 02:44:37.100
HYPOTHESES WARMING IS ONE OF

02:44:37.167 --> 02:44:38.468
THEM THE MOVEMENT OF SPECIES

02:44:38.535 --> 02:44:40.337
WITHOUT WARNING- NOT ALL

02:44:40.403 --> 02:44:42.405
SIGNATURE ARE. CREATED EQUAL IN

02:44:42.472 --> 02:44:43.974
THE SENSE THAT SOME ARE REALLY

02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:46.076
HOT COMPARED TO OTHERS- AND

02:44:46.142 --> 02:44:47.577
THOSE HOT ONES SEEM TO BE

02:44:47.644 --> 02:44:49.312
RESPONDING MAYBE- A LITTLE MORE

02:44:49.379 --> 02:44:51.147
DON'T. WARMING AND THERE IS

02:44:51.214 --> 02:44:51.681
EVIDENCE AND ALL KINDS OF

02:44:51.748 --> 02:44:53.750
RESEARCH THAT. WARMING AND

02:44:53.817 --> 02:44:56.052
INCREASED. OR DECREASED PH IN

02:44:56.119 --> 02:44:57.454
THE WATER IT'S THE HARMFUL

02:44:57.520 --> 02:44:59.089
ALGAL SPECIES ARE THE REALLY

02:44:59.155 --> 02:45:00.824
TOXIC ONES THAT TEND TO RESPOND

02:45:00.890 --> 02:45:03.593
THE MOST. WHAT I. NOT A 100%

02:45:03.660 --> 02:45:05.262
SURE BUT- IT DOES SEEM LIKE

02:45:05.328 --> 02:45:06.896
THERE IS A CONNECTION AND THAT

02:45:06.963 --> 02:45:08.665
MIGHT BE WHY. WE CONTINUE TO

02:45:08.732 --> 02:45:09.899
SEE THE SMART FORWARD AND I

02:45:09.966 --> 02:45:11.167
WOULD JUST SAY THAT. WHEN I

02:45:11.234 --> 02:45:12.602
STARTED WORKING ON THIS AND ONE

02:45:12.669 --> 02:45:13.336
OF THE REASONS I MENTIONED THE

02:45:13.403 --> 02:45:14.437
THRESHOLDS WHEN I MENTIONED THE

02:45:14.504 --> 02:45:15.739
MODEL SO THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO

02:45:15.805 --> 02:45:17.340
REVISE THOSE. WHAT MADE A

02:45:17.407 --> 02:45:18.942
REALLY HIGH PARTICULATE DEMO

02:45:19.009 --> 02:45:20.710
GAS CITY EVENT IN OUR MINDS.

02:45:20.777 --> 02:45:22.312
AND LET'S SAY AROUND THE EARLY

02:45:22.379 --> 02:45:24.147
TWO THOUSANDS WEST FIVE HUNDRED

02:45:24.214 --> 02:45:25.682
NANOGRAMS PER LITER. NOW DURING

02:45:25.749 --> 02:45:26.650
THAT THE BLOCK WHEN I FIRST

02:45:26.716 --> 02:45:29.352
TESTIFIED WITH YOU- WE WERE

02:45:29.419 --> 02:45:30.687
MADE ME REALIZE HOW MOBILE IS

02:45:30.754 --> 02:45:31.655
NOW A NEW HOT SPOT WE HAD

02:45:31.721 --> 02:45:33.423
NEVER. SEEN THAT BEFORE MAYBE

02:45:33.490 --> 02:45:35.325
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T MEASURING.

02:45:35.392 --> 02:45:37.227
BUT WE STARTED TO GET WATER.

02:45:37.294 --> 02:45:38.628
CONCENTRATIONS ON THE LEVEL OF

02:45:38.695 --> 02:45:39.896
A HUNDRED THOUSAND ANAGRAMS

02:45:39.963 --> 02:45:41.698
LEADER AND MORE SO YOU CAN JUST

02:45:41.765 --> 02:45:42.666
SEE THE SCALE OF WHAT WE'RE

02:45:42.732 --> 02:45:44.534
TALKING ABOUT. JUST HOW

02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:46.169
DRAMATICALLY THINGS HAVE

02:45:46.236 --> 02:45:48.772
CHANGED. SINCE YOU KNOW TWO

02:45:48.838 --> 02:45:50.407
DECADES AGO ENTERTAINERS AND I

02:45:50.473 --> 02:45:51.141
KNOW WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE

02:45:51.207 --> 02:45:53.777
LATE BUT YOU JUST QUICKLY. E.

02:45:53.843 --> 02:46:00.317
SO YOU YOU ALSO. BELIEVE THAT.

02:46:00.383 --> 02:46:01.418
THERE COULD BE LAN BASE.

02:46:01.484 --> 02:46:02.519
MATERIAL THAT FLOW. OUT INTO

02:46:02.585 --> 02:46:05.055
THE OCEAN IS ALSO CAUSING THIS

02:46:05.121 --> 02:46:06.456
JUST IF YOU DON'T MIND GIVE US

02:46:06.523 --> 02:46:08.625
SOME SNIPPETS ON YOUR

02:46:08.692 --> 02:46:10.827
HYPOTHESIS ON THIS. I WOULD

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:11.995
JUST CAUTION AND SAY WELL I

02:46:12.062 --> 02:46:14.030
THINK- LAND BASED NUTRIENTS CAN

02:46:14.097 --> 02:46:15.365
PLAY A ROLE I DON'T THINK

02:46:15.432 --> 02:46:16.800
THERE'S A COST FOR THE KIND OF

02:46:16.866 --> 02:46:18.335
CHANGES WERE SEEN HER SAY WHAT

02:46:18.401 --> 02:46:19.769
I THINK. THE ROLE THAT THEY

02:46:19.836 --> 02:46:21.204
PLAY IS THEY COULD PROBABLY

02:46:21.271 --> 02:46:23.406
POSSIBLY MAKE AN EVENT MORE

02:46:23.473 --> 02:46:25.408
TOXIC- THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT

02:46:25.475 --> 02:46:27.043
IF YOU HAVE AN EXTENT STUDENT

02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:28.645
YOU BLEW THE WATER LET'S SAY

02:46:28.712 --> 02:46:30.113
MODERATE PAIN YOU GET A BIG.

02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:31.648
ATMOSPHERIC RIVER EVENT A LOT

02:46:31.715 --> 02:46:33.350
OF FLOW FROM SANTA PANCHA WROTE

02:46:33.416 --> 02:46:34.617
THAT THOSE CELLS CAN TRAIN MORE

02:46:34.684 --> 02:46:36.953
TOXIC- AND THAT HAS TO DO AGAIN

02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:39.422
WITH MUSIC BOX NOW THE IDEA

02:46:39.489 --> 02:46:41.024
THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH RIVER FLOW

02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:41.725
ALL THE TIME THAT WHENEVER WE

02:46:41.791 --> 02:46:43.293
SEE A GIVEN THE MOST ACCIDENTS

02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:45.095
BECAUSE OF LAND BASED NUTRIENTS

02:46:45.161 --> 02:46:47.263
THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT- THEIR

02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:49.933
SYNERGISTIC. AND THEY CAN WORK

02:46:49.999 --> 02:46:51.301
OFF OF ONE ANOTHER BUT I WOULD

02:46:51.368 --> 02:46:53.303
SAY IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE THAT'S

02:46:53.370 --> 02:46:54.838
DRIVING THE TREND THAT YOU

02:46:54.904 --> 02:46:55.605

03:17:55.063 --> 03:17:56.497
REALLY A QUESTION YOU KNOW

THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT- SOME OF

03:17:58.566 --> 03:17:59.601
THAT FUNDING IS GOING TO BE

03:17:59.667 --> 03:18:00.468
MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER

THAT NEEDS TO BE BAD- WE'RE

03:18:09.444 --> 03:18:10.945

03:18:17.719 --> 03:18:19.887
THESE ACTIONS TAKE PLACE. WE

03:18:19.954 --> 03:18:22.657

AGENCIES. YEAH BUT WE NEED TO

03:18:34.602 --> 03:18:35.870
BE ABLE TO PUT THIS INTO PLACE

03:18:35.937 --> 03:18:37.505
RIGHT WITH POLICY SO I THINK

03:18:37.572 --> 03:18:38.006
THAT'S THE OTHER REALLY

03:18:38.072 --> 03:18:39.974
IMPORTANT ITEM. WHEN IT COMES

03:18:40.041 --> 03:18:41.142
TO INDEBTEDNESS SO IT BECOMES

03:18:41.209 --> 03:18:43.311
PART OF THE CULTURE RIGHT. WHEN

03:18:43.378 --> 03:18:45.546
IT COMES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

03:18:45.613 --> 03:18:47.415

BE ABLE TO BECOME. A HOME HERE

03:19:03.531 --> 03:19:05.133
ON THE WEST COAST FOR THIS. BUT

03:19:05.199 --> 03:19:07.101
THE LEVEL THERE ALWAYS SEEMS TO

03:19:07.168 --> 03:19:07.969
BE A BIT OF A STUMBLING BLOCK

03:19:08.036 --> 03:19:10.738

03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:03.991

ABOUT WHAT DATA WE'RE

03:25:48.369 --> 03:25:50.237
COLLECTING AND HOW WE DO IT.

03:25:50.304 --> 03:25:52.173
FOR EXAMPLE FISH YOUR BONES

03:25:52.239 --> 03:25:53.274
WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR

03:26:16.464 --> 03:26:17.298
THAT WE BREAK DOWN ANY

CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH

03:26:31.278 --> 03:26:32.146

03:26:32.213 --> 03:26:33.914
RESOURCES AND THE CAPACITY TO

03:26:33.981 --> 03:26:35.750
DO THEIR WORK AS PART OF THAT

03:26:35.816 --> 03:26:37.284
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO RECRUIT

03:26:37.351 --> 03:26:39.487
AND RETAIN GREAT PEOPLE. AS WE

03:26:39.553 --> 03:26:40.788
NOW KNOW FROM THE SERVICE BASED

MULTIPLE BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS

03:26:45.292 --> 03:26:45.826
AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT

03:26:45.893 --> 03:26:47.661
EMBRACED. THE DEPARTMENT

TARGETED INVESTMENT WILL BE

03:27:10.351 --> 03:27:12.953
NEEDED. IT IS ALSO IMPERATIVE

03:27:13.020 --> 03:27:14.221
THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUED TO

03:27:14.288 --> 03:27:15.256
DEDICATE ITS LIMITED STAFF

ENGAGEMENT IS A NECESSARY STEP

03:27:51.225 --> 03:27:52.293
IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT

03:27:52.359 --> 03:27:53.360

THE COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC HUMAN

03:28:01.735 --> 03:28:04.138

03:28:04.205 --> 03:28:05.606
WE HAVE MORE LATINO ASIAN

03:28:05.673 --> 03:28:07.308

ACCESS TO DECISION MAKING

03:28:11.445 --> 03:28:14.281
POWER. WHERE HOW AND WHEN WILL

03:28:14.348 --> 03:28:16.016
THEIR VOICES BE HEARD. HOW DO

03:28:16.083 --> 03:28:17.418
WE HAVE ALSO THAT OPPORTUNITIES

03:28:17.484 --> 03:28:19.186
IN FISHERIES AND FISHERIES

03:28:19.253 --> 03:28:19.920
DECISION MAKING ARE OPEN TO

AGENCY HAS SIGNALED THEY WANT

03:28:23.524 --> 03:28:25.092
TO START THIS DIALOGUE. WE ARE

03:28:25.159 --> 03:28:26.026
ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THIS

03:28:26.093 --> 03:28:27.761
IMPORTANT URGENT EFFORT AND

MUST BE INVITED PARTICIPANTS.

03:28:31.966 --> 03:28:33.868
RELATEDLY WE MUST THINK DEEPLY

03:28:33.934 --> 03:28:34.602
ABOUT OUR COASTAL FISHING

03:28:34.668 --> 03:28:36.337
CITIES AND TOWNS AND WHAT THE

OF USERS TO THE FISHING

03:44:11.337 --> 03:44:12.872
INDUSTRY. THE LACK OF

MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE

MANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE ASKED

COMMONPLACE JUST LAST WEEK WE

03:44:43.136 --> 03:44:44.170

WIND OVER THE LAST TWENTY

03:44:50.677 --> 03:44:52.545
YEARS. OUR MARINE ECOSYSTEM IS

03:44:52.612 --> 03:44:53.980
TOO IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE TO

03:44:54.047 --> 03:44:55.615
ALLOW INDUSTRIALIZATION WITHOUT

03:45:07.594 --> 03:45:08.561
WEEKLY IT KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE

03:45:08.628 --> 03:45:12.565
ARE. DIFFERENT FORMS AND TYPE

03:45:12.632 --> 03:45:13.132

03:45:13.199 --> 03:45:14.400
ABOUT- OPEN WATER AND FISH SELL

THESE INTRA OF LOSS OF FISHING.

03:45:15.969 --> 03:45:17.270
AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS

03:45:17.337 --> 03:45:19.405
SURROUNDING THE OPERATIONS. AND

03:45:19.472 --> 03:45:21.174
AS WE HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER FROM

PLIGHT OF THE STATE'S SALMON

03:45:24.277 --> 03:45:26.179
FISHERIES. I WILL NOTE THAT

03:45:26.246 --> 03:45:27.680
RECENT STUDIES HAVE POSTULATED

03:45:27.747 --> 03:45:29.048
THAT COVERING CALIFORNIA'S

03:45:29.115 --> 03:45:30.750

GENERATE EIGHT GIGAWATTS OF

RENEWABLE ENERGY WELL SAVING

03:45:33.887 --> 03:45:34.921
MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER

03:45:34.988 --> 03:45:36.556
FROM EVAPORATION WE SHOULD

03:45:36.623 --> 03:45:38.424
PRIORITIZE LOOKING AT THAT. IN

03:45:38.491 --> 03:45:39.926
TERMS OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

03:45:39.993 --> 03:45:41.461
WITH THIS REGARD YOU'RE SURE

03:45:41.527 --> 03:45:42.829
THAT THE FISHING INDUSTRY BOTH

03:45:42.896 --> 03:45:44.464
COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL HAD

03:45:44.530 --> 03:45:45.798
MEANINGFUL ROLES AN ACTIVE

03:45:47.967 --> 03:45:49.435
TO ACTIVITIES THAT INITIAL

03:45:49.502 --> 03:45:53.406
RESISTANCE RESTRICT. OUR ACCESS

03:45:53.473 --> 03:45:54.040
FOR EXAMPLE THIRTY. AFTER

03:45:54.107 --> 03:45:55.909

OUR FISHERIES ARE NUANCED AND

03:46:05.051 --> 03:46:06.686
MANAGEMENT OF THOSE REQUIRED OF

03:46:06.753 --> 03:46:07.954
THOSE REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE AND

03:46:08.021 --> 03:46:09.155
EXPERTISE AND HOW THESE

03:46:09.222 --> 03:46:10.823
FISHERIES OPERATE THERE IS A

03:46:10.890 --> 03:46:11.591
GROWING CONCERN THAT THE

03:46:11.658 --> 03:46:12.992
COMMISSION DOESN'T HAVE THAT

03:46:13.059 --> 03:46:15.128
NECESSARY EXPERTISE. THERE IS

03:46:15.194 --> 03:46:16.262
WANT TO WRAP UP BY TALKING

03:46:16.329 --> 03:46:17.764
ABOUT SOME OF THE UGLIER WE'RE

03:46:17.830 --> 03:46:19.332
WE'RE LOOKING AT ME THAT THERE

03:46:19.399 --> 03:46:21.000
IS A VERY REAL FEAR THAT ABSENT

03:46:21.067 --> 03:46:22.101
SUPPORT THERE MAY BE NO

03:46:22.168 --> 03:46:23.136

CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE NEXT TEN

03:46:24.537 --> 03:46:26.506
YEARS EVERY YEAR WE ARE ASKED

03:46:26.572 --> 03:46:27.807
TO GET MORE CATCH LAST AND

03:46:27.874 --> 03:46:28.942
CHANGE OUR OPERATING BUSINESS

03:46:29.008 --> 03:46:30.510
MODELS. THE FISHERMEN JUST

03:46:30.576 --> 03:46:31.644
TEXTED ME AND HIGHLIGHTED THE

03:46:31.711 --> 03:46:33.179
INCREASED COST OF OPERATING

03:46:33.246 --> 03:46:34.881
FROM INSURANCE TO FUEL TO

03:46:34.948 --> 03:46:35.949
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT TREATMENT OF

03:46:36.015 --> 03:46:37.583
CRUISE WE ASK THAT THE

03:46:37.650 --> 03:46:38.952
EXEMPTION PROVIDED FOR THE

03:46:39.018 --> 03:46:42.655

UNDER EIGHTY FIVE BE EXTENDED.

03:46:43.356 --> 03:46:44.590
COREY NOTED WE NEED TO

03:46:44.657 --> 03:46:45.758
PRIORITIZE SCIENCE TO GET

03:46:45.825 --> 03:46:47.293
TOGETHER TO MAKE OUR FISHERIES

03:46:47.360 --> 03:46:48.761
RESILIENT. TO CHANGING OCEAN

03:46:48.828 --> 03:46:50.263
CONDITIONS. WE MUST ALSO

03:46:50.330 --> 03:46:51.731
UNDERSTAND THE DEMOGRAPHICS THE

03:46:51.798 --> 03:46:52.966
CURRENT STATE OF INFRASTRUCTURE

03:46:53.032 --> 03:46:53.833
WHICH SUPPORTS FISHING

03:46:53.900 --> 03:46:55.068
ACTIVITIES AND PORTS AND

03:46:55.134 --> 03:46:56.502
HARBORS UP AND DOWN THE STATE.

03:46:56.569 --> 03:46:57.737
AND ANALYZE WHETHER THESE

03:46:57.804 --> 03:47:00.940
FACILITIES CONTINUE TO SERVE

03:47:01.007 --> 03:47:02.141
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SUPPORT.

03:47:02.208 --> 03:47:03.710
I WAS GONNA I WAS GONNA LET

03:47:03.776 --> 03:47:06.446
LEAVE ROGERS TESTIFYING AS HE

03:47:06.512 --> 03:47:06.946
SAID I DON'T KNOW THAT I

03:47:07.013 --> 03:47:08.281
COULDN'T STAND IT ANY BETTER.

03:47:08.348 --> 03:47:09.649
WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT FOR THE

03:47:09.716 --> 03:47:11.050
VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS

03:47:11.117 --> 03:47:12.819
THE ONLY ACCESS THEY HAVE TO

03:47:12.885 --> 03:47:14.087
THE LIVING REEF RESOURCES ARE

03:47:14.153 --> 03:47:15.888
STATE WATERS. IS THROUGH THE

03:47:15.955 --> 03:47:17.657
SEAFOOD WE HARVEST FOR THEM.

03:47:17.724 --> 03:47:18.825
ACTUALLY JUST RESTRICT OUR

GOVERNMENT CONSERVATION GROUPS

03:49:05.131 --> 03:49:06.232
BETWEEN A HEALTHY OCEAN

ENVIRONMENT. AND A HEALTHY

LOCAL SEAFOOD ECONOMY. A

03:49:10.169 --> 03:49:11.838
COMMERCIAL FISHING IS SUCH AN

03:49:11.904 --> 03:49:13.339
IMPORTANT PART OF THE CULTURE

03:49:13.406 --> 03:49:15.241
AND ECONOMY OF MONTEREY BAY.

03:49:15.308 --> 03:49:16.909
AND IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR FOOD

03:49:16.976 --> 03:49:19.212
SECURITY AS THE PENTECOSTAL. WE

03:49:19.278 --> 03:49:21.013
FEEL STRONGLY THAT OUR COASTAL

03:49:21.080 --> 03:49:22.982
COMMUNITIES SHOULD HAVE ACCESS

03:49:23.049 --> 03:49:24.650

UNSUSTAINABLY AND WITH

03:49:31.791 --> 03:49:33.426
QUESTIONABLE LABOR PRACTICES.

03:49:33.493 --> 03:49:34.894
THERE'S NO REASON WHY THAT

03:49:34.961 --> 03:49:36.496
SHOULD BE THE CASE WE HAVE MANY

03:49:36.562 --> 03:49:38.431
HEALTHY FISH STOCKS. ROBUST

03:49:38.498 --> 03:49:40.199
FISHERIES MANAGEMENT A GROWING

03:49:40.266 --> 03:49:41.767
LOCAL FOOD MOVEMENT AND

03:49:41.834 --> 03:49:44.036
FISHERMEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE

03:49:44.103 --> 03:49:46.572
EAGER TO WORK. BUT AS ROGER AND

03:49:46.639 --> 03:49:47.607
MIKE AND OTHERS HAVE DISCUSSED

03:49:47.673 --> 03:49:49.408
BEFORE ME CALIFORNIA'S FISHING

03:49:49.475 --> 03:49:51.744
INDUSTRY IS FACED WITH ENORMOUS

03:49:51.811 --> 03:49:53.980
CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES. AS A

03:49:54.046 --> 03:49:55.148
FISHERMAN SAID TO ME THE OTHER

03:49:55.214 --> 03:49:57.083
DAY IT FEELS LIKE A BUCKET FULL

03:49:57.150 --> 03:49:58.518
OF HOLES THAT JUST KEEPS

03:49:58.584 --> 03:49:59.952
BRINGING NEW LEAKS AND EVERY

03:50:00.019 --> 03:50:01.954
TIME YOU PLUG ONE HOLE ANOTHER

03:50:02.021 --> 03:50:04.423
HOLE OPENS UP. SO THIS PANEL IS

03:50:04.490 --> 03:50:05.892
ABOUT HOW TO KEEP CALIFORNIA

03:50:05.958 --> 03:50:07.026
FISHERIES AND COASTAL

03:50:07.093 --> 03:50:08.761
COMMUNITIES THRIVING. SO WHAT

03:50:08.828 --> 03:50:10.363
NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE IN ORDER

03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:12.398
TO DO THAT. WE NEED HEALTHY

03:50:12.465 --> 03:50:14.534
FISH STOCKS IN ECOSYSTEMS WHICH

03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:16.135
DEPENDS ON EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT

03:50:16.202 --> 03:50:17.570
AND STEWARDSHIP. AND THE

03:50:17.637 --> 03:50:19.505
MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION OF

03:50:19.572 --> 03:50:21.807
FISHERY STAKEHOLDERS. FISHERMEN

03:50:21.874 --> 03:50:24.010
NEED ACCESS TO FISHING RIGHTS

03:50:24.076 --> 03:50:25.077
THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND

03:50:25.144 --> 03:50:26.646
AVAILABLE AND THEY ALSO NEED

03:50:26.712 --> 03:50:28.080
ACCESS TO THEIR PRODUCTIVE

03:50:28.147 --> 03:50:29.949
FISHING GROUNDS. THEY NEED

03:50:30.016 --> 03:50:31.317
INFRASTRUCTURE WITH ICE

03:50:31.384 --> 03:50:33.853
MACHINES FUEL STORAGE IN A MIX

03:50:33.920 --> 03:50:36.055
OF BUSINESS SENSE. AND THEY

03:50:36.122 --> 03:50:36.689
NEED A DIVERSITY OF MARKETS IN

03:50:36.756 --> 03:50:39.325
CHOICE. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

03:50:39.392 --> 03:50:40.326
TO HAVE A DIVERSITY OF

03:50:40.393 --> 03:50:41.627
FISHERIES AND BOTH THE

03:50:41.694 --> 03:50:43.596
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND SUPPORT

03:50:43.663 --> 03:50:45.898
LEVEL. A JUSTICE FISHERMEN DO

03:50:45.965 --> 03:50:46.799
BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE MULTIPLE

03:50:46.866 --> 03:50:48.768
APARTMENTS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

03:50:48.834 --> 03:50:50.069
THAT THE MOST RESILIENT FISHING

03:50:50.136 --> 03:50:51.904
PORTS ARE THOSE THAT HAVE A MIX

03:50:51.971 --> 03:50:53.472
OF FISHERIES INCLUDING HIGH

03:50:53.539 --> 03:50:58.311
VOLUME LOW VOLUME DIFFERENT.

03:50:58.377 --> 03:50:59.979
ISSUE STRUGGLING FISHERMEN CAN

03:51:00.046 --> 03:51:01.847
LEAN ON OTHER FISHERIES AND

03:51:01.914 --> 03:51:03.082
THIS MAINTAINS A CENTRAL

03:51:03.149 --> 03:51:05.284
PROCESSING AND POOR

03:51:05.351 --> 03:51:05.818
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS

03:51:05.885 --> 03:51:08.354
MARKETS. AND FINALLY THE

03:51:08.421 --> 03:51:09.655
FISHING INDUSTRY NEEDS A

03:51:09.722 --> 03:51:11.624
SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT WITH

03:51:11.691 --> 03:51:13.759
GOVERNMENT MANAGERS CONSUMERS

03:51:13.826 --> 03:51:15.661
COMMUNITY PARTNERS LENDERS AND

03:51:15.728 --> 03:51:18.097
OTHER STOCKING. AT THE MONTEREY

03:51:18.164 --> 03:51:19.532
BAY FISHERIES TRUST WE BELIEVE

03:51:19.599 --> 03:51:21.400
WE NEED TO BE MOVING FORWARD ON

03:51:21.467 --> 03:51:22.702
ALL OF THESE FRONTS TO

03:51:22.768 --> 03:51:24.437
STRENGTHEN THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND

03:51:24.503 --> 03:51:25.972
IN DOING SO WE CAN BUILD

03:51:26.038 --> 03:51:27.273
RESILIENCE IN OUR FISHING

03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:28.674
COMMUNITIES SO THAT THEY'RE

03:51:28.741 --> 03:51:30.910
STRONGER AND BETTER ABLE TO

03:51:30.977 --> 03:51:32.712
WEATHER FUTURE STORMS. AMONG

03:51:32.778 --> 03:51:35.948
OUR PROGRAMS- WE STARTED IN TWO

03:51:36.015 --> 03:51:36.415
THOUSAND FOURTEEN AS A

03:51:36.482 --> 03:51:37.750
COMMUNITY QUOTA FUNDS FOR THE

03:51:37.817 --> 03:51:38.884
WEST COAST GROUNDFISH TRAWL

03:51:38.951 --> 03:51:40.419
FISHERY. TO PROTECT OUR

03:51:40.486 --> 03:51:42.655
COMMUNITY'S FUTURE ACCESS TO

03:51:42.722 --> 03:51:43.456
THIS HIGH VOLUME YEAR ROUND

03:51:43.522 --> 03:51:45.558
FISHERY. THIS WAS INTENDED TO

03:51:45.625 --> 03:51:47.226
PREVENT SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF

03:51:47.293 --> 03:51:48.594
CONSOLIDATION IN THE CAPTURE

03:51:48.661 --> 03:51:50.663

FISHERMEN AT AFFORDABLE RATES.

03:51:54.267 --> 03:51:55.635
BUT THIS IS JUST FOR ONE

03:51:55.701 --> 03:51:57.103
FISHERY. AND WE'RE STARTING TO

03:51:57.169 --> 03:51:58.604
EXPLORE WHETHER. WHETHER

03:51:58.671 --> 03:52:00.273
THERE'S A ROLE FOR GROUPS LIKE

03:52:00.339 --> 03:52:02.275
OURS TO PLAY IN OTHER FISHERIES

03:52:02.341 --> 03:52:04.977
TO HELP ADDRESS ISSUES OF

03:52:05.044 --> 03:52:06.412
ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. THERE

03:52:06.479 --> 03:52:08.180
ARE MANY SMALL SCALE FISHERMEN

03:52:08.247 --> 03:52:09.515
AND FISHING BUSINESSES THAT ARE

03:52:09.582 --> 03:52:11.550

HAVE THE BACKING AND RESOURCES

03:52:13.085 --> 03:52:14.987
THAT LARGER DISTANCES YOU. SO

03:52:15.054 --> 03:52:15.888
WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY

03:52:15.955 --> 03:52:17.523

TO WORK WORKING TO MAKE IT

03:52:20.860 --> 03:52:22.094
EASIER FOR FISHERMEN TO STAY

03:52:22.161 --> 03:52:23.729
INFORMED AND INVOLVED IN THE

03:52:23.796 --> 03:52:25.531
MANAGEMENT PROCESS TO ENSURE

03:52:25.598 --> 03:52:26.766
THEY HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE

03:52:26.832 --> 03:52:28.367
WHEN DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE

03:52:28.434 --> 03:52:30.169

03:52:41.247 --> 03:52:42.915
IS ALSO WORKING TO SUPPORT THE

03:52:42.982 --> 03:52:44.417
EXISTING STEWARDSHIP OF LOCAL

MARKET FLOYD'S FOR THE FISHING

03:52:58.464 --> 03:53:00.166
INDUSTRY DURING THE PANDEMIC. A

03:53:00.232 --> 03:53:01.734
BIG PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING

03:53:01.801 --> 03:53:03.436
TO DO IS TO CREATE A MORE

03:58:33.399 --> 03:58:35.034
STANCE IN QUITE SOME TIME. WHAT

03:58:35.100 --> 03:58:37.169
DO YOU THINK THE STATE NEEDS TO

SOLUTIONS TO THE LESSONS

I THANK YOU MR CHAIR ON. I

03:58:49.715 --> 03:58:52.317
THINK I'M LEARNING FROM THAT

03:58:52.384 --> 03:58:53.218
COUNCIL EXPERIENCE NOT FEDERAL

03:58:53.285 --> 03:58:55.921
EXPERIENCE- THE STATE CAN TAKE

03:58:55.988 --> 03:58:57.056
AWAY SORT OF STUFF SOME PROCESS

03:58:57.122 --> 03:58:58.390
RECOMMENDATIONS IN SALCOMBE

03:58:58.457 --> 03:59:00.259
RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK

03:59:00.325 --> 03:59:02.661
ANYTHING THAT THE STATE HAS TO

03:59:02.728 --> 03:59:03.729
THINK ABOUT THIS IT'S REALLY

03:59:03.796 --> 03:59:04.563
IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE

03:59:04.630 --> 03:59:06.398
STAKEHOLDERS- ONE OF OUR

03:59:06.465 --> 03:59:09.234
LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT

03:59:09.301 --> 03:59:11.336
PROCESS WAS THE IMPORTANCE. OF

03:59:11.403 --> 03:59:13.005
BRINGING IN STAKEHOLDERS NOT

03:59:13.072 --> 03:59:15.240
ONLY ON FISHERMEN AND OTHER

03:59:15.307 --> 03:59:16.175
FOLKS ASSOCIATED WITH

03:59:16.241 --> 03:59:17.976
FISHERIES- BUT THINKING WIDER

03:59:18.043 --> 03:59:20.412
THAN THAT- AND MAKING SURE THAT

03:59:20.479 --> 03:59:21.480
EVERYONE HAS THE ABILITY TO

03:59:21.547 --> 03:59:23.415
PARTICIPATE AND ADD THEIR POINT

03:59:23.482 --> 03:59:27.252
OF VIEW- OUTCOME LIES. I THINK

03:59:27.319 --> 03:59:28.120
THE COUNCIL AT THIS POINT IS

03:59:28.187 --> 03:59:29.822
ENTERTAINING A LOT OF REALLY

03:59:29.888 --> 03:59:31.623
GOOD IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE

03:59:31.690 --> 03:59:33.659
OUR FEDERAL FISHERIES READY FOR

03:59:33.726 --> 03:59:35.627
CLIMATE CHANGE ON A LOT OF THEM

03:59:35.694 --> 03:59:37.696
ARE ABOUT HOW CAN WE MAKE OUR

03:59:37.763 --> 03:59:38.430
SCIENCE AND DATA COLLECTION

03:59:38.497 --> 03:59:41.734
ROBUST. THINKING ABOUT THE-

03:59:41.800 --> 03:59:42.968
SUDDEN CHANGES THAT WE'RE

03:59:43.035 --> 03:59:44.770
SEEING FROM CLIMATE CHANGE-

03:59:44.837 --> 03:59:45.938
WHETHER THAT BE SOMETHING LIKE

03:59:46.004 --> 03:59:47.973
THE WARM BLOG OR SOCIAL CHANGE

03:59:48.040 --> 03:59:50.409
LIKE COATED- AND THEN THINKING

03:59:50.476 --> 03:59:51.543
ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN

03:59:51.610 --> 03:59:53.512
ACTUALLY DO FOR MANAGEMENT

03:59:53.579 --> 03:59:56.081
WHETHER THAT BE SOMETHING LIKE-

03:59:56.148 --> 03:59:57.382
REDOING OUR HARVESTING FOR
