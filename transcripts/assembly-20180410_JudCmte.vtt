I ALSO WANT TO VOTE. NOTE THAT

00:59:13.517 --> 00:59:16.787 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REALLY

WHEN HE TESTIFIED IN TWO

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:38.575 region:rollup2

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:40.710 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

00:59:38.575 --> 00:59:42.479 region:rollup2
WAS THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:44.281 region:rollup2

I DO WANT TO RAISE WHICH WAS

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:14.150 region:rollup2

THAT.

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:36.439 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY GETS ADDRESSED AND

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:38.541 region:rollup2

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.609 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE WE'RE ADDING.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:41.244 region:rollup2

ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WAS

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:50.386 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:53.556 region:rollup2

01:27:29.344 --> 01:27:32.547 region:rollup2
HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL AS

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.715 region:rollup2
IT'S

01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:35.751 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO BE AMENDED SINCE WE

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:38.153 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT SEEN THE LANGUAGE OF

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:40.455 region:rollup2
THAT. THOSE AMENDMENTS

01:27:38.153 --> 01:27:42.491 region:rollup2
I'M SO AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:44.326 region:rollup2
GENERALLY TO THE ISSUE HARM.

01:27:42.491 --> 01:27:46.294 region:rollup2

GREAT APPRECIATION

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:54.636 region:rollup2
FOR FOUND THAT SITUATION I THINK

01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:56.037 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ON

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:57.672 region:rollup2
CUTTING BACK ON THE SCOPE OF THE

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:59.708 region:rollup2
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IN SOME WAY.

01:27:57.672 --> 01:28:02.177 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BELIEVER AVOID THAT.

01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:04.045 region:rollup2
THAT KIND.

01:28:02.177 --> 01:28:06.481 region:rollup2
AND I'M I'M I'M NOT AT ALL SURE

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:08.517 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IT WOULD COME IN THE

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:09.584 region:rollup2
LAST WEEK I WOULD LIKE TO REVIEW

01:28:08.517 --> 01:28:13.522 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS WHEN THEY'RE.

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:14.156 region:rollup2

01:28:13.522 --> 01:28:14.356 region:rollup2
TECHNO LOOK AT THE BILL AT THAT

01:28:14.156 --> 01:28:17.859 region:rollup2

.

01:28:29.838 --> 01:28:32.240 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:28:30.939 --> 01:28:34.109 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WAS

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.944 region:rollup2
CREATED WITH A PRESUMPTION OF

01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:38.547 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION

01:28:35.944 --> 01:28:39.881 region:rollup2
ABOUT WITNESSES AND VICTIMS.

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:42.617 region:rollup2
IN ORDER FOR THE COMMUNITY

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:45.020 region:rollup2
ITSELF TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:46.655 region:rollup2
OF CRIME ARE IN IT IN THE AREA

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.490 region:rollup2
WHERE. PEOPLE LIVE

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:50.058 region:rollup2
ON AND ALSO TO HELP PROTECT

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:53.228 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES FROM THAT CRIME.

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:55.330 region:rollup2
AND ANY DIMINISHMENT OF ACCESS

01:28:53.228 --> 01:28:56.798 region:rollup2
TO THAT INFORMATION.

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:58.400 region:rollup2
DISABLED PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE

01:28:56.798 --> 01:29:01.002 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:03.071 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE WOULD NEVER SUGGEST

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:04.539 region:rollup2
THAT PUBLIC ACCESS SHOULD ALWAYS

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:06.575 region:rollup2
TRUMP.

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:08.977 region:rollup2
THE PERSONAL SAFETY OF SOMEONE

01:29:06.575 --> 01:29:10.645 region:rollup2
WHO WAS A VICTIM OR WITNESS.

01:29:08.977 --> 01:29:13.715 region:rollup2
THE LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS WHO FOR

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:17.118 region:rollup2
AMECHANISM TO BE USED WHEN

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:18.887 region:rollup2
THERE IS A THREAT TO A VICTIM A

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:20.488 region:rollup2
WITNESS OR THE INVESTIGATION

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:23.024 region:rollup2
ITSELF WE THINK THAT'S AN

01:29:20.488 --> 01:29:24.960 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE STANDARD AND. IF

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:26.127 region:rollup2
THERE IS ANYONE ANYWHERE WHERE

REFORM.

01:29:26.127 --> 01:29:31.633 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE FOCUSED IT IS ON THAT

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:32.701 region:rollup2
WHERE IT MAY BE DEFECTIVE OR

01:29:31.633 --> 01:29:34.536 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE IN PROTECTING.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:35.704 region:rollup2
OF VICTIMS OR WITNESSES WE THINK

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:37.539 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS WHERE.

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:38.707 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS SHOULD BE.

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:40.008 region:rollup2
I'M WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:41.076 region:rollup2

WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN THE BILL

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.923 region:rollup2
NOW. ALLOWING FOR ANYONE

DISCUSSION IN THE BILL'S

01:47:04.051 --> 01:47:07.988 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS.

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:09.089 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:10.858 region:rollup2
FROM THE LAW BANNING SEXUAL

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:13.794 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS OR

01:47:10.858 --> 01:47:16.096 region:rollup2

01:47:13.794 --> 01:47:17.531 region:rollup2
TWO CASES CHALLENGED THAT LAW

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:19.833 region:rollup2
UNDER FREE SPEECH AND FREE

01:47:24.505 --> 01:47:28.208 region:rollup2
THAT A PROHIBITION ON SO SHHH.

01:47:25.873 --> 01:47:30.244 region:rollup2
PERSONS UNDER EIGHTEEN SURVIVED

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:32.112 region:rollup2
TO THESE CHALLENGES BECAUSE THE

01:47:30.244 --> 01:47:33.614 region:rollup2
LAW WAS NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THE

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:34.949 region:rollup2
REGULATION OF PROFESSIONAL

01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:36.083 region:rollup2
CONDUCT.

01:47:34.949 --> 01:47:38.385 region:rollup2
BUT THE NINTH CIRCUIT FOUND THAT

01:47:36.083 --> 01:47:39.620 region:rollup2
EVEN LICENSED PROFESSIONALS

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:40.954 region:rollup2
COULD COMMUNICATE WITH THE

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:42.856 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ABOUT SOCIAL.

01:47:40.954 --> 01:47:44.091 region:rollup2
IN CONTRAST

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:45.159 region:rollup2
THIS BILL PROHIBITS SOCIAL

01:47:44.091 --> 01:47:47.294 region:rollup2
ADVERTISEMENTS

01:47:45.159 --> 01:47:48.295 region:rollup2
BY ALL PERSONS.

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:49.697 region:rollup2
FURTHER THE COURT FOUND THAT

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:51.398 region:rollup2
LICENSED PROFESSIONALS COULD

01:47:49.697 --> 01:47:52.933 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND SOCIAL TO

01:48:00.274 --> 01:48:03.210 region:rollup2

AWAY.

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:06.747 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE IS

01:48:05.179 --> 01:48:07.381 region:rollup2
NOT A REGULATION OF PROFESSIONAL

01:48:06.747 --> 01:48:12.886 region:rollup2
CONDUCT RATHER THAN THE BUSINESS

01:48:07.381 --> 01:48:15.456 region:rollup2
AND

PROFESSIONS CODE.

01:48:15.456 --> 01:48:18.525 region:rollup2
UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS LAW THIS

01:48:17.458 --> 01:48:18.993 region:rollup2
BILL STRETCHES FAR BEYOND

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:20.661 region:rollup2

MINISTRIES ENGAGED IN SOCIAL. IF

01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:28.635 region:rollup2

01:49:42.209 --> 01:49:45.779 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T FIT IN WITH THE BOYS

01:50:07.201 --> 01:50:10.571 region:rollup2
COULD HELP.

01:50:08.235 --> 01:50:13.207 region:rollup2

I MARRIED HER IN TWO THOUSAND

01:50:42.636 --> 01:50:45.906 region:rollup2
AND SIX.

01:50:43.837 --> 01:50:48.342 region:rollup2
SHE'S THE ONE PERSON WHO THROWS

01:50:45.906 --> 01:50:50.477 region:rollup2
ME SEXUALLY. I'M FAITHFUL TO HER

01:50:48.342 --> 01:50:52.679 region:rollup2

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:55.182 region:rollup2
AFTER DELIVERING MY TWINS.

01:50:52.679 --> 01:50:56.783 region:rollup2

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:06.793 region:rollup2
ASKING MY HELD HER HAND AS SHE

01:51:05.359 --> 01:51:08.795 region:rollup2

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:10.030 region:rollup2
SHE IS MY MOST PRECIOUS GIFT.

01:51:08.795 --> 01:51:11.198 region:rollup2
AND TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:12.599 region:rollup2

FRAUD ISSUE BECAUSE. I BELIEVE

01:59:58.858 --> 02:00:01.428 region:rollup2

THERAPIES THAT.

02:00:12.906 --> 02:00:15.041 region:rollup2
START HERB OF THE HAVE THE

02:00:13.773 --> 02:00:16.576 region:rollup2
PROMISE.

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:18.578 region:rollup2
THAT SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND

02:00:16.576 --> 02:00:21.448 region:rollup2

THAT LANGUAGE

02:03:00.039 --> 02:03:03.076 region:rollup2

WITH THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

02:41:11.362 --> 02:41:14.431 region:rollup2
SINCE THERE'S NO AGENCY OF

02:41:33.317 --> 02:41:35.753 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT IT CAN TAKE UP

THAT ACTUALLY MEANS THE SECOND

02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:44.628 region:rollup2
STEP IS REALLY.

02:41:43.561 --> 02:41:45.930 region:rollup2
IF YOU NEED TO HIRE THE

02:41:44.628 --> 02:41:48.666 region:rollup2

THE REASON WHY THIS IS SO

02:42:33.177 --> 02:42:36.480 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO COMBAT THE IN THIS

02:42:35.045 --> 02:42:38.082 region:rollup2

.

03:04:28.891 --> 03:04:31.727 region:rollup2
SO QUITE FRANKLY THE IDEA THAT

03:04:30.359 --> 03:04:32.695 region:rollup2

03:04:31.727 --> 03:04:34.931 region:rollup2
ON MY OWN CHILD.

03:04:32.695 --> 03:04:37.233 region:rollup2

03:04:34.931 --> 03:04:39.101 region:rollup2
I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT.

03:04:37.233 --> 03:04:41.170 region:rollup2

THE BILL BEFORE YOU ALL TODAY.

03:04:53.316 --> 03:04:56.552 region:rollup2

THAT WE ARE BREAKING THE

03:04:56.552 --> 03:05:00.823 region:rollup2
BARRIERS

03:04:57.954 --> 03:05:02.558 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN ACCESS IS.

03:05:00.823 --> 03:05:04.961 region:rollup2
BLOCK IS DENIED.

03:05:02.558 --> 03:05:07.396 region:rollup2

03:05:09.198 --> 03:05:14.103 region:rollup2
DOES IT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT

03:05:11.267 --> 03:05:15.504 region:rollup2
TRAGIC EVENT.

03:05:14.103 --> 03:05:17.974 region:rollup2

WORKING TOGETHER.

03:05:19.609 --> 03:05:23.012 region:rollup2
I'M NOT TRYING TO DENY ACCESS TO

03:05:21.243 --> 03:05:25.047 region:rollup2
ANYBODY ON TRYING TO ENSURE THAT

03:05:23.012 --> 03:05:26.515 region:rollup2
ACCESS IS THERE.

03:05:25.047 --> 03:05:28.050 region:rollup2

THAT WE ARE ENSURING.

03:05:33.556 --> 03:05:38.694 region:rollup2
THAT THINGS GET FIX.

03:05:36.926 --> 03:05:40.830 region:rollup2
FOR ME THIS ISN'T ABOUT LAWSUITS

03:05:38.694 --> 03:05:42.164 region:rollup2
TO SUSAN ABOUT ANY OF THIS THIS

03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:44.166 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT THE SIMPLE FACT.

03:05:42.164 --> 03:05:46.102 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

03:05:44.166 --> 03:05:47.937 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE'S FORTY

03:05:46.102 --> 03:05:49.872 region:rollup2

OWNERS WHO BARELY UNDERSTAND

03:05:55.111 --> 03:05:59.348 region:rollup2
ENGLISH LET ALONE THE

03:05:57.079 --> 03:06:01.217 region:rollup2
COMPLICATIONS OF OUR LAW.

03:05:59.348 --> 03:06:02.885 region:rollup2
WE HAVE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS WHO

03:06:01.217 --> 03:06:04.453 region:rollup2
DON'T REALIZE ALL THESE THINGS

03:06:02.885 --> 03:06:06.022 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CITIES AND COUNTIES AND

03:06:04.453 --> 03:06:07.289 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITIES THAT GIVE THESE

03:06:06.022 --> 03:06:08.891 region:rollup2

GOOD TO GO SO THEY'RE EXCITED

03:06:08.891 --> 03:06:12.428 region:rollup2
AND THEY THINK THEY'RE OKAY.

03:06:11.394 --> 03:06:14.096 region:rollup2
THE FACT IS WE HAVE A BROKEN

03:06:12.428 --> 03:06:15.498 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

03:06:14.096 --> 03:06:17.133 region:rollup2
