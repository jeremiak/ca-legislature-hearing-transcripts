MISTER TANK YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU BUT SPEAKER THIS IS S. B. ONE SEVENTY ARE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR AS WE REFLECT ON THIS YEAR'S BUDGET I THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. WE WENT INTO THIS YEAR VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT OUR BUDGET PICTURE MAY LOOK LIKE WE WERE STILL IN A WE'RE WE CONTINUE TO BE A PANDEMIC. OUR BUSINESSES WERE CLOSE WE WERE STAYING AT HOME WE WERE WORRIED VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT OUR REVENUE OUTLOOK WOULD BE WE PLAN FOR THE WORST AND WE GOT ONE OF THE BEST BUDGETS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY ACTUALLY BE LARGEST BUDGET IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. WE STARTED OFF THE YEAR VERY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT SCHOOLS WERE INCENTIVIZED TO RE OPEN WE DID AN EARLY WILDFIRE PACKAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT AHEAD OF WILDFIRE SEASON WITH THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE TO. SEND SOME OF THE LARGEST TAX BREAKS BACK TO INDIVIDUALS WERE STRUGGLING BUSINESSES THAT WERE HURTING FROM THE PANDEMIC MAKING SURE THAT OUR ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND TO FUNCTION AND EXPAND EVEN AS WE WERE CONTINUING TO GRAPPLE. GRAPPLE WITH COVERT. IN JUNE WEEK. THE BUT IS STATES. HIGHEST INVESTMENT IN OUR QUEUE THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM HI THIS POOR PEOPLE SPENDING IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. WE MOVE TOWARD UNIVERSAL T. K. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN CHILDCARE SO PEOPLE COULD GET BACK TO WORK WE EXPANDED OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO WE COULD MOVE CLOSER TO OUR GOAL OF UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE FOR EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIANS. IN OUR STATE THEN WE PUT IN. THE FUNDING FOR CLIMATE PACKAGE FOR OUR WILDFIRE PACKAGE IN OUR WATER PACKAGE WHICH WE'RE DEALING WITH TODAY. IT OF COURSE LAST BUT DEFINITELY OT LEAST. SEE HUGE INVESTMENTS FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS THE ISSUE THAT REALLY- WE CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH AS WE TRY TO FIND A WAY. TO HOUSE EVERY CALIFORNIAN WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO AS CALIFORNIANS MOVE HERE AS PEOPLE MOVE HERE TO CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE COULD NOT ONLY GOOD A JOB. BUT THAT THEY CAN FIND A PLACE TO LIVE. SO TODAY IN OUR SB ONE SEVENTY ARE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR OUR MAJOR ITEMS ARE WE HAVE NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR WILDFIRES. THE SIGNIFICANT SPENDING FOR FOREST HEALTH AND PREVENTION. WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE MILLION FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY. OF LARGEST PART OF THE GOING TO WORK TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM AS WELL AS- A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN URBAN GREENING IN. OUR VARIOUS CONSERVANCIES. EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR DROUGHT RESILIENCY. WITH A HUNDRED TWENTY FOR SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER. FOR THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT AS WELL AS A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION FOR WATER RECYCLING IN THIRTY MILLION TO BEGIN OUR INVESTMENT FOR P. FAST CLEAN UP WHICH HAS BEEN. IN A FORTUNATE CONTAMINANT OF OUR WATERS. OF FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE WITH TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN ABOUT FOUR FARMERS TO INCENTIVIZE THEM ENCOURAGE THEM TO REPLACE. THEIR OLD DIESEL MOTORS AND- MACHINES WITH NEWER MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND LESS POLLUTING MACHINES. TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR OUR PARKS TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION HOUSING WE'VE BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT. MAKING SURE. THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. YET WHILE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP OUR FEES FLAT. THE COST OF LIVING HAS GONE UP AND UP AND OFTEN TIMES THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GO TO SCHOOL NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE FEES. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE SO IT'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES UCCS YOU TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS. SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR OUR COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE PROGRAM TO REALLY ENSURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES HARDEST HIT. BY ARE TRANSITIONING TO A CLEANER GREENER ECONOMY ARE REALLY GOING TO GET INVESTMENT TO HELP THEM GET OUT OF OUR COVERT. KOVITZ A HERE DRAW THE SECOND ON. DOWNTURN IN AGAIN TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO ELIMINATE CRIMINAL FEES WHICH TO HELP. REIMBURSE COUNTIES AS WE ELIMINATE THESE FEES HELP BACKFILL THE REVENUE THAT'S BEING LOST. BY THE COUNTIES AND THEN LASTLY- TWENTY SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION TO SUPPORT AFGHAN REFUGEES WHO RECENTLY. LEFT AFGHANISTAN AND HAVE COME HERE TO. CALIFORNIA WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE FOR SB ONE SEVENTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHANG MR FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I UNFORTUNATELY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL FIRST LET ME SAY THAT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR ASSEMBLY BUDGET SHARE WHO I'VE WATCHED NAVIGATE A BUDGET YEAR UNLIKE ANY OTHER BUT MEMBERS OUR STATE IS FACING TREMENDOUS CRISES ON TOP OF THE PANDEMIC OUR STATE IS FACING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES WHICH THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS. BUT THE ONE CRISIS I'M AFRAID WE ARE NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSING WITH LONG TERM SOLUTIONS IS THE DROUGHT THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE DURING ESPECIALLY FOR US IN THE CENTER VALLEY CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING THE MOST SEVERE DROUGHT CONDITIONS SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HUMILITY'S A RUN OUT OF WATER. FARMERS ARE FORCED TO DESTROY CROPS THAT PROVIDE NEEDED FOOD PRODUCTION JOBS ARE BEING ELIMINATED IN CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE FACING THE REALITY OF HIGHER FOOD PRICES CALIFORNIA'S LAST SIGNIFICANT WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT WITH THE STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH WAS BUILT OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE STATE'S POPULATION WAS A MERE SIXTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA IS NOW HOME TO NEARLY FORTY MILLION PEOPLE OUR STATE NEEDS A RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY IN THIS FUNDAMENTAL NEED REQUIRES INCREASED WATER STORAGE AFFECTED CONVEYANCE FACILITIES THAT CAN MOVE WATER ACROSS OUR STATE. THIS BUDGET. PROVIDES NOT ONE ADDITIONAL DOLLAR. FOR ADDITIONAL WATER STORAGE PROJECTS. IT WAS CONFIRMED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT A BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING. CLAIMING THAT APPARENTLY PROP ONE WAS APPARENTLY ENOUGH. IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS SINCE PROBLEM WAS PASSED AND LESS THAN 7% OF THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN SPENT. PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED ARE STILL STE TRUCKSTOP IN A REGULATORY VORTEX WITH UNCERTAINTY FACING PENDING PERMITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. BUT DOES THIS BUDGET FASTRACK THESE PROJECTS TOWARD COMPLETION. NOW DOES THIS BUDGET PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO GET THESE PROJECTS DONE FASTER OR EVEN BETTER GET EVEN MORE WATER STORAGE CAPACITY ONLINE. NO DOES THIS BUDGET PROVIDE INVESTMENT TO COMPLETE THE CONVEYANCE AND SUBSIDENCE ISSUES HINDERING OUR ABILITY TO MOVE WATER ACROSS OUR STATE. NO ALL THE WHILE WE KNOW WE WILL SEE AN INDOOR MORE DROUGHTS IN THE FUTURE. THIS BUDGET IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE THE PROJECTS BUT WE APPARENTLY LACK THE POLITICAL WILL. MEMBERS ALL OF US HAVE STATED THAT PORTRAIT OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT HANGS ABOVE THIS CHAMBER. HE SERVED AND LED IN A TIME OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY. BUT ALSO TOOK ACTION THAT PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. WE ALSO SERVE IN A TIME OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY AND WE MUST MAKE DECISIONS THAT PLAN FOR THE FUTURE I WOULD MAKE IT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO WATER AND WATER STORAGE THESE ARE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS. WE TALK OF BEING BOLD WE TALK ABOUT BEING AMBITIOUS WE TALK ABOUT BEING FORWARD THINKING. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTING A WATER STORAGE NOT JUST FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ACTIONS TAKEN ARE NOT BOLD. THEY'RE NOT AMBITIOUS AND THEY'RE NOT FORWARD THINKING. THIS IS OUR FIFTH THE BUDGET BILL. WE HAVE INDEED. MADE IT'S A ROCKY FIVE OF THE BUDGET SEASON. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL I CAN RECOMMEND I URGE IN ABOUT. MISS FRIEDMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE SEVENTY I FIRST WANT TO COMMEND. OUR BUDGET CHAIR AND ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ON THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS HISTORIC BILL I DO WANT TO JUST MENTION ONE. POINT ONE ELEMENT OF THIS BILL. AND HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED YET AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. AS MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW WE HAVE BEEN- IN ONGOING TALKS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AND ARE SENATE PARTNERS. ON THE BEST WAY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS INCREDIBLY TRANSFORMATIVE AN IMPORTANT PROJECT THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IN OUR STATE- AS WE- ALLOCATE THE REST OF THE BOND MONEY THAT IS OUR ROLE ARE CORRECT ROLE AS- OVERSIGHT- AGENTS FOR THIS PROJECT. THE TALKS ARE EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT BY JANUARY WILL BE SEEING THE RESULTS OF THAT AND ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD- BUT I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET ALSO DOES CONTAIN BASELINE FUNDING FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. GINGER TO ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WHILE WE'RE HAVING OUR TALKS TO THERE'S NO INTERRUPTION OF THEIR WORK. I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT UP FOR MEMBERS AND FOR THE PUBLIC AND WITH THAT I RETURN I BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN DR WHAT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE CHAIR AND SPEAKER. INCLUDING IN THE BUDGET FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A BRIDGE LOAN TO DISTRICT HOSPITALS. MANY DISTRICT HOSPITALS ARE SMALLER FACILITIES LOCATED IN RURAL AREAS. IN ADDITION TO BEING HIT HARD BY THE PANDEMIC THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY STRUGGLED STRUGGLED FINANCIALLY. EVEN PRIOR TO THIS PANDEMIC. THIS MONEY PROVIDES GAP FUNDING FOR THE DISTRICT HOSPITALS AS A TRANSITION TO A NEW REIMBURSEMENT MODELS. WITHOUT THIS ASSISTANCE MULTIPLE CLOSURES WOULD HAVE COULD HAVE OCCURRED. THIS FUNDING DIVERT SECOND TASK IFFY. AND IT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED BY THE COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON THESE HOSPITALS. BUT ALSO LIKE TO EXPRESS THANKS FOR THE HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATE PARKS. WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT THESE JAMS CONTINUE TO BE SAFE. AND AFFORDABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THIS INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INCREDIBLE REDWOOD RIDING REDWOODS RISING PROJECT IN MY DISTRICT.

TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY NINE REQUIRES GREATER TRANSPARENCY ARE HOW OUR WILDFIRE DOLLARS ARE SPENT. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES A LIMITED AND TEMPORARY SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS BUT THIS EXEMPTION WILL NOT BE APPLYING TO THE DELTA TUNNELS.

THAT BROWN ON FEAR ANXIETY AND DESTRUCTION. WE ALL WE ALL AGREE THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS NEEDED BUT WHAT IS STILL LACKING OTHER CRITICAL STREAMLINING OF REGULATIONS THAT ALLOW FOR MORE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PROJECTS TO BE STARTED.

LAST WEEK SEVERAL OF US HEARD FROM HEALTHY FOR STEWARDS THAT BURDENSOME RED TAPE OR A MAJOR ROADBLOCK TO REMOVING OUR FORESTS OF DEAD TREES AND COMBUSTIBLE VEGETATION THAT ARE FUELING THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES.

THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT WHAT YOU SAW AT THAT TIME. AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING TODAY OUR NINE DAY. GIVEN THE STATE'S THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WINDFALL THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCLUDE FUNDING FOR NEEDED WATER STORAGE AND IS DISAPPOINTING THAT THIS OPPORTUNITY AS PASSING THIS LEGISLATURE BY. IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT BUDGETS REFLECT OUR PRIORITIES FOR US IN THE CENTER VALLEY. WATER IS LIFE. WATER STORAGE IS THE FOUNDATION.

THANK YOU FOR THE OBJECTION AS SOMEONE WHO'S NOT IN THE BUT COMMITTEE COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE RATIONALITY TO INCLUDE PAY RAISES FOR THE CPUC COMMISSIONERS. IN A BILL DEALING WITH COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND WELFARE PENSIONS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN DIRECTED US IN OUR IN YOUR CLOTHES. YOU ALSO BACK TO THE- NUMBER ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU. MYSTERIES ARE YOU CAN. CONCLUDED MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY. SAYING THANK YOU FOR GETTING THIS CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION- INTO THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF. THE SB NINE A ONE DEAL THAT WAS REACHED A FEW YEARS BACK AND GIVES ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. OF CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION TO ORDER MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE CAP AND TRADE G. G. R. F. FUND. TO FUND WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. I SAID AND BUDGET INFORMATIONAL HEARING. I'M NOT SURE WHO TO THANK FOR THAT. YOU KNOW I'M NOT AND I GUESS THAT'S MAYBE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I MEAN. SO MUCH OF THE STUFF WERE LEFT OUT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS. WE TALK ABOUT IT. WE BRING IT UP WE WRITE LETTERS- YOU CERTAINLY HEARD FOR ME A LOT ABOUT THIS THIS YEAR I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WAS SO HARD. TO MAKE SURE THIS IS A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION THAT'S ALWAYS SAID ALL YEAR LONG. IN A DIFFERENT BUDGET BILLS WE'D GET OKAY HERE'S A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT pACTUALLY A REDUCTION. IN FUNDING. THAT'S A PROBLEM- BUT I KNOW THAT OTHERS BEEN WORKING ON THIS VERY HARD AND I'M THANKFUL THAT THOSE VOICES ONE OUT IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND WE HAVE THAT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION COMMITMENT. WHAT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH THAT THAT THAT'S REALLY JUST A BASELINE. THAT'S A BASELINE WE'VE HAD THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND LAST YEAR THAT MONEY WAS ACTUALLY CUT BECAUSE THE CAP ND TRADE FUND DIDN'T PRODUCE ENOUGH REVENUE. AND THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM. SO WE NEED TO REALLY ENSURE THAT THIS MONEY IS GOING TO GET SPENT AND GET DOWN TO PROJECTS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN WITH THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. LAST YEAR WITH THE THIRTY FIVE STREAMLINED PROJECTS WE ONLY DID ELEVEN THOUSAND ACRES THAT'S THE FACT. WHEN WE NEED TO BE DOING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR. THAT'S WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY WE NEED TO DO TO GET ON TOP OF THIS ISSUE. AND WE NEED TO TREAT THIS WITH THE URGENCY THAT'S NECESSARY. SCIENTISTS TELL US THE SCIENCE TELLS US THAT EVEN WITH EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IT WOULD BE DECADES. BEFORE YOU REVERTED THE CLIMATE BACK. TO WHAT WE'RE USED TO. SO ALL THE MORE REASON THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING THINGS LIKE THIS LIKE FUEL REDUCTION ARE FOREST DOUBLING DOWN ON IT LIKE HAVING EARLIER ACTION. AERIAL FIRES SO THEY DON'T GET BIG GETTING WHEN THEY'RE SMALL. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE- FROM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO. THIS IS ABOUT CLIMATE ADAPTATION THIS IS A CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY JUST LIKE C. RISES JUST LIKE INCREASING BEACHES BEACH FRONT AND BRINGING AND SAND. THIS IS CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND YOU NEED TO TREAT IT WITH THE URGENCY THAT'S NECESSARY. TWO HUNDRED MILLION IS JUST A BASS LINE IF WE THINK THAT THAT'S IT. AND WE SAY HEY WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING AND WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE NOW WE'RE TRULY ON TOP OF THIS ISSUE YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION. WE ONLY ELEVEN THOUSAND ACRES LAST YEAR. WITH THIRTY FIVE STREAMLINED PROJECTS EQUAL STREAMLINED PROJECTS WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THIS BILL. WE DON'T DO ANYTHING TO DO SEEK A STREAMLINING. IN THIS BILL FOR NOT FOR WILDFIRE REDUCTION. WE DO IT FOR NATIVE FISH POPULATIONS WE KNOW THAT WE CAN DO IT. BECAUSE WE'RE DOING IT FOR NATIVE FISH. RESTORATION PROJECTS SEQUEL EXEMPTION FULL EXEMPTION. WE'RE DOING IT TO TAKE DOWN THEIR ARMS I MEAN THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND. WE'RE IN A DROUGHT. WE NEED MORE WATER STORAGE AND WE'RE WE'RE STREAMLINING THE SECRET PROCESS TO TAKE DOWNS DOWN. IT A LITTLE BIT MORE INFO ON THAT YOU KNOW WHO OWNS THOSE DAMS. WARREN BUFFETT. YOU KNOW WHO'S ON THE HOOK FOR LIABILITY IF THERE'S ISSUES WERE TAKEN DOWN THOSE DAMS THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER. SO WE'RE DOING A SEQUEL STREAMLINING THIRTY SETTING DOWN DAMS FOR WARREN BUFFETT. LET THAT SAID INTERESTED SECOND. AND I GUESS I'M JUST TIRED OF ALWAYS HAVING THIS HOBSON'S CHOICE. ON OUR SIDE ANYWAY WE DON'T GET INCLUDED NOBODY TALKS TO US WE GET A BILL AT THE END THERE'S SOME STUFF WE LIKE AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF THAT WE DON'T LIKE RAISES FOR PC COMMISSIONERS. REALLY THEY'VE BEEN DOING THEIR JOB OVERSEEING PG&amp;E. YOU WANT ME TO VOTE FOR THAT. NO ME TO VOTE TO TAKE DOWN THEIR ARMS. IN A DROUGHT NO ME TO VOTE FOR SEQUEL EXEMPTION TWENTY WON'T DO IT FOR A WHILE FOR PREVENTION THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THE STATE'S GOING TO ADMINISTER GALLAGHER. WE ALL RECOGNIZE IT BUT WE SHOULD SHOW. MIRED IN A. DR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR- ARE BUDGET CHAIRS FROM BOTH HOUSES ARE LEADERSHIP. YOU KNOW BUDGETS- THERE'S ALWAYS THINGS IN BUDGETS THAT THAT WE DON'T LIKE OR WE THINK SHOULD BE BETTER. THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THIS AND LESS OF THAT THAT IS THE CHOICE THAT WE ALL HAVE. ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE THERE THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEEN IN THIS IN SOME OF THESE BUDGET BILLS. THAT THAT WOULD BENEFIT MY COMMUNITIES MORE ABSOLUTELY I GOT A COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW COUPLE COMMUNITIES THEY'RE HAVING TO HAVE WATER TRUCK TO THEM IT'S A TWO HOUR DRIVE. THIS IS DRINKING WATER THIS IS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY. BUT THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO APPLY FOR A GRANT. AND HOPE THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET THAT GRANT BUT IN THE MEANTIME IT'S GOING TO BE A MILLION OR TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO TRUCK WATER FOR DRINKING WATER IN PUBLIC SAFETY BUT WE DIDN'T GET THAT. IN THE BUDGET. AND THAT'S AND I'LL KEEP FIGHTING FOR MY COMMUNITIES DESERVE THAT. THE WILDFIRE ISSUE YOU KNOW- WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR THAT FOR A LONG TIME. NOW SENATOR DOLLY AND MYSELF IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE CALL THAT THE DOLLYWOOD PLAN A BI PARTISAN EFFORT THEY GOT AS ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS FROM GIGI R. F. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF NAY SAYERS ESSAY YOU'LL NEVER GET MONEY FROM G. G. R. AFTER THAT. BUT I WANT TO CREDIT GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. FOR HIS FORESIGHT IN UNDERSTANDING AND SEEING. THAT THESE WILDFIRES EMIT HUGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THEREBY REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS HE RECOGNIZE THAT. AND WENT ALONG WITH THIS AND IT GAVE ADDITIONAL MONEY- AFTER AFTER CONVERSATION THAT'S A BIG DEAL TO GET THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION FOR THE AFTER HAN FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. IS HUGE. THAT'S WHAT THE L. A. O. RECOMMENDED INTEL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE DIDN'T GET IT. BUT WE GOT IT NOW. AND YES IS NOT ENOUGH I WOULD AGREE THE L. A. O. SAID IT SHOULD BE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. BUT WHICH IS A LONG LONG LONG WAY. DOWN THE ROAD IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION AND WE NEED TO CELEBRATE THAT AND I HOPE IT'S NOT MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE. CAN RECOGNIZE THAT. MY COMMUNITY WAS RAVAGED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED HOMES GONE. I RECOGNIZE THAT MIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM. BUT WHEREVER THAT IN IN BUTTE COUNTY. I'M SORRY INDICUS IN EAST NICHOLAS I BELIEVE- MY APOLOGIES. I RECOGNIZE THAT HIS COMMUNITIES WERE RAVAGED I RECOGNIZE THAT MY COLLEAGUES FROM FROM BEAVERS COMMUNITIES WERE RAVAGED AS WELL WE ALL SUFFERED FROM NOW. THIS IS A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I HOPE THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T LIKE EVERYTHING IN THE BUDGET THAT MAY BE BECAUSE OF THIS IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUSH THE GREEN BUTTON. IT'S A BIG DEAL IT'S A BIG BIG DEAL FOR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT MONEY THAT WAS BEING SPENT ISN'T JUST ABOUT THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECT THAT'S MONIES GOING OUT INTO COMMUNITIES. TO THE PER PROJECTS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. YOU'LL HEAR A BILL LATER THAT I HOPE. WE'LL CREATE MORE OF AN URGENCY AROUND THESE PROJECTS TO HAVE YEAR ROUND FIRE FOR FIRE PREVENTION REWS WORKING THAT ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY DURING FIRE SEASON.

THIS IS ON THE SENATE THIRD READING FILE. FILE ITEM ONE TWENTY FIVE SENATE BILL. SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN. AND A CORPORATE SENATE BILL SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR LEYVA AND ACCLIMATE TO IMPLEMENT MS GONZALEZ THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN AIMS TO PREVENT WAGE THEFT WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THE BILL REQUIRES JOINT LIABILITY OF DIRECT AND SUBCONTRACTORS FOR LOOK PENALTIES AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES DUE TO WAGE THAT BY SUBCONTRACTORS CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BILLS ARE INFRASTRUCTURE IS A KEY DRIVER THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND HAS PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSING UNITS ANNUALLY. THE INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY PROVIDED A PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS WITH FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS BUT FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS THOSE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY WORN DOWN TODAY OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE FAMILIES ARE CURRENTLY LOW INCOME IN OVER ONE THIRD OF ALL THESE FAMILIES EARN LESS THAN INCOME. CONSTRUCTION WAGES HAVE GONE DOWN BUT WAIT STAFF AND CASH PAYMENTS HAVE INCREASED CALIFORNIA LOSES BETWEEN THREE TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE PER YEAR DUE TO UNREPORTED UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION WAGES PROVIDING A SUBSIDY TO THE CONTRACTORS WHO STEAL FROM THESE WORKERS. UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS HAVE AN ILLEGAL AND UNFAIR ADVANTAGE SINCE THE UNDERMINE WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY EVEN THOUGH PASSED LEGISLATION IS MADE SOME DIFFERENCES IT'S NOT DONE ENOUGH SOME CONTRACTOR STILL CONSIDER WAGE THEFT AND THE EXPENSE OF PAYING FOR THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS JUST PART OF DOING BUSINESS SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY CONTRACTOR DO ANYTHING THEY'RE NOT ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE DOING A GENERAL CONTRACTOR SIMPLY NEED TO REVIEW THE RECORDS OF THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS. LEGALLY REQUIRED PAYROLL RECORDS IF THEY DON'T GET THEM OR IF THEY DON'T LOOK RIGHT THEY CAN STOP PAYMENT TILL THINGS ARE FIXED AND THEY WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY PENALTIES. IF THEY DON'T AND JUST LOOK THE OTHER WAY AS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR YEARS THEN I'LL SHARE IN THE LIABILITY FOR THOSE PENALTIES MEMBER IT'S TIME WE TREAT WAGE THEFT SERIOUSLY WE HAVE GOT TO STOP THIS PRACTICE WE CAN'T CONTINUE PLAY BLACK THEM ALL FROM THE STATE. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTORS SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ. MR SANTIAGO THANK YOU- I RISE THAT IS SUPPORT THE BILL AND ASK OUR COLLEAGUES TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF IT. MANY OF YOU KNEW THAT I ONCE WORKED AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. AND ONE OF THE JOBS AND RESPONSIBILITIES I HAD WAS TO RUN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY TASK FORCE. AND WHAT WE FOUND OUT. VERY QUICKLY AS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY THIS DOES A CAR. NOT MANY OF US CAN DRIVE BY SITES AND- MAYBE NOT NOTICE IT BUT OFTENTIMES YOU DO HAVE BAD ACTORS I'M NOT GONNA SILVA BACK IS A GOOD ACTORS TOO WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT. THE BY FAR WHICH THAT DOES OCCUR IN THIS INDUSTRY. AT RATES THAT ARE ALARMING. AND IT HAPPENS IN DIFFERENT WAYS YOU SEE IT IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHAT WE SEE IS YOU YOU PICK UP PEOPLE ON THE CORNER SOMETIMES FOLKS UNDOCUMENTED. SOMETIMES FOLKS DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO WORK. AND THEY TAKE HIM TO WORK AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IN THIS MY JOB WAS TO GO OUT THERE AND CRACK DOWN ON THIS STUFF. AND WHAT WE OFTEN SAW AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS ONES NOT THE NORMAL BUT MOST AGREE JUST. WHERE YOU PICK UP YOUNG MEN. AND IN SOME CASES UNDOCUMENTED. THANK YOU IF YOU SEE THOSE BIG TRASH TRUCKS WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH IT OPEN IN IN THOSE TOUCH YOU WOULD PULL OUT COURTS AND IN THESE CARDS THERE WAS DIFFERENT SORTS OF TOOL FOR DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK SO THEY WERE BEING ELECTRICAL WORKERS AT ONE POINT IN TIME. THEY WOULD BE PAINTERS AND APPOINT TIME IN ANOTHER TIME THAT WOULD PUT UP THEY WOULD PUT UP THE WALLS AND IS ANOTHER OR PLUMBERS. AND IT OFTEN WORK TWELVE HOURS A DAY. NOW WHEN WE WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO DO THESE MULTI AGENCY TASK FORCE SWEEPS. AND THEY WERE DONE WITH CAL OSHA E. DE DIR AND A NUMBER OF FTV BEALE WE A NUMBER OF AGENCIES WHAT WE WOULD FIND OUT IS THAT THE BOOKS OFTENTIMES SHOWED. THE PERSON FOR FORTY HOURS A WEEK. THOSE ARE THE COOKBOOKS THE ACTUAL DATA WHICH SHOW THAT THEY WORK TWELVE HOUR TWELVE HOURS A DAY AND THE ACTUAL PAYMENT WILL SHOW FOR TWENTY HOURS A DAY. SO THIS DOES OCCUR EVEN IF A BOOK SHOW THAT TOOK. WHAT WE ALSO FOUND OUT IS IF THERE'S NO TEETH DOES NOT LIABILITY THEY WILL COMPLY WITH THE LAW NOW THOSE IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS OF ACTS AND IT HAPPENED EVERYWHERE. RIGHT SMACK CENTER DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES I REPRESENT BUT ALSO ON THE L. A. COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD THAT I WORKED AT WHERE THEY DID HAVE WITH THE DID HELP RULES REGULATIONS FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS HAPPENS AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENFORCEMENT COMPLIANCE OR LIABILITY. YOU CAN'T STOP IT. AND I EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT THIS WASN'T JUST A ONE TIME THING. THIS HAPPENED OVER AND OVER. SO THIS BILL IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HOLD SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE WON'T HAPPEN HELLO BY AND FOR. BLAME FOR THE BEST CASE SCENARIO THAT THIS BILL IS NOT NEEDED BECAUSE FOLKS ARE FOLLOWING WHAT THE LAW WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. SO IF YOU'RE A GOOD CONTRACTOR YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FIGHT ON THIS. IF YOUR BED CONTRACTOR YEAH YOU COULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT WILL HOLD YOU LIABLE TO FOLLOW THE LAW WHICH IS BASICALLY. WHICH BASICALLY SAYS THAT YOU PAY SOMEBODY FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DID. AND IF YOU DON'T STEAL IT. AND WE ACTUALLY SAW THIS WE WOULD SEE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WORK. FOR TWO WEEKS OR FOUR MONTHS WHATEVER THE CONTRACT WAS. THEY GET PAID ON A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THAT WEIGHT. AND THEN THEY'D BE FIRED IF THEY COMPLAINED. SO WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO GET THIS DONE BECAUSE WAIT STAFF IS A REAL ISSUE AND PEOPLE HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THE ONLY WAY TO PAY. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THOSE IN THE CHAIN I HELD LIABLE FOR THAT WAIT STAFF. I CAN'T I CAN'T. SPEAK ABOUT THIS OR NOT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DID THIS WORK FOR SOME TIME. IT WE WOULD INTERVIEW PEOPLE OVER AND OVER AND OVER. WHO WOULD BE TERRIFIED TO LOSE THEIR JOB WHETHER WORKING TWELVE HOURS A DAY. THE BOOK SHOW THAT THEY WERE PAID FOR TWENTY TO FORTY HOURS THAT WEEK. AND THE PAYMENT PLAN REALLY WAS FOR TWENTY HOURS THAT WEEK. THIS DOES OCCUR IT'S REAL AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE WHAT'S AT STAKE IT'S PEOPLE WORKING AND HAVING THE WAGES STOLEN. I RESPECTFULLY WOULD ASK FOR DIVERT. THANK YOU MISS SANTIAGO MS REYES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I ALSO RISE. TO URGE OUR MEMBERS TO VOTE I ON THIS SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN ATTACHED THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. IVEL FOR PENALTIES OR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IF THE SUBCONTRACTORS THEY HIRE FAIRLY FAILED TO PAY THEIR WORKERS. CENTRAL LABOR HAS ACCEPTED CONTRACTOR AMENDMENTS THAT RELIEVE THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR IF AND ADDED LIVE OF ANY LYLE ADDED LIABILITIES IF THEY TAKE THE REQUIRED ACTIONS. THOSE AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE STANDARD PROCEDURES IN THE FORMAL CONSTRUCTION ECONOMY HAVE MOVED ALMOST ALL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATIONS FROM OPPOSED TO NEUTRAL. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY DOES NOT LET THE SUBCONTRACTORS OFF THE HOOK FOR VIOLATIONS IT MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THEY WILL VIOLATE THE LAW IN THE FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE THE GENERAL CONTRACTORS ARE JOINTLY LIABLE THEY WILL PAY MORE I PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS BEHAVIOR ON THE JOB. THAT WILL HELP WORKERS IT WILL HELP HONEST CONTRACTORS IT WILL HELP THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS REYES.
