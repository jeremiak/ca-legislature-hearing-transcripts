LEGISLATION REALLY TO THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND ADMINISTERED SMALL GRANT PROGRAM. AS A CURRENTLY HAD THE KELLY PA PROVIDES GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS -- TO HELP ADDRESS MY MIL JUST ISSUES IN THESE GRANT PAYMENTS MAXIMUM WARDS OF FIFTY THOUSAND ARE WE ARE AWARDED UPON THE COMPLETION OF PROGRAM WORK -- AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR APPROVED PROJECTS UNFORTUNATELY. SMALL ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALWAYS ABLE TO PUT UP BY THE INITIAL COST OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND ARE DETERRED FROM APPLYING FOR FIND IT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL WOULD GIVE. THE KELLY PAY A FORTY TO PROVIDE ADVANCE -- THESE PAYMENTS SHORTIES WHICH WILL RELIEVE THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON THE SMALL ORGANIZATIONS IS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THEY COULD ALSO BOOST THE PARTICIPATION ENCOURAGE MORE ORGANIZATIONS TO PIPER FINDING AND REALLY DRIVE THESE PROJECTS LOCALLY AND SO -- TWELVE FIFTY TO THE GOOD GOVERNMENT MEASURE WITH OBSERVABLE COSTS IS A BILL THAT IS RECEIVED. BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WE DO HAVE SOME BILL SPONSORS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARIA ROGER FROM CALIFORNIA RELIEF A NETWORK OF OVER HUNDRED ORGANIZATION STATEWIDE DROUGHT THE KIND OF THROUGHOUT THE STATE. COMMITTED TO PROMOTING URBAN FORTUNE IRVINE GRAINY -- WE AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE -- STUFF THAT. COMMITTEE STAFF THAT. THE NATURE OF THE SMALL GRANTS INHERENTLY MINIMIZED. RISKS TO MISUSE FUNDS WE SEE ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACCOUNTABILITY CONTROLS TO PREVENT THE MISUSE OF FUNDS AS BEING OBSERVABLE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL IN INFORMATION THAT MST. ALREADY BE PROVIDED BY APPLICANTS AND REVIEWED BY THE AGENCY STAFF FOR CURRENT -- GRANTS CARRY A WILL HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE IF AND HOW TO MEASURES. TO ADMINISTER EVENTS PAYMENTS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS -- FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE AYE VOTE. IN ANY OTHER WITNESSES SINCE SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION. SHARE FILE. WE DON'T HAVE AN APPROVED POSITION -- BUT WOULD KNOW THE KELLY EPA ESTIMATES THE COST OF THIS BILL ARE MINOR AN OBSERVABLE. WE DID A SHOW LATE NOTE THAT -- THE BILL MAY RESULT IN UNKNOWN POTENTIAL LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH MISSPENT AND OR MISUSED VANCE FUNDS TO EXTEND THEIR UNRECOVERABLE [inaudible] RESTORE CASH. WHAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE EIGHT MONTH PERIOD OF HAVING TO SPEND ALL THE MONEY ON THE GRANT WITHIN EIGHT MONTHS. SO THAT WAS AN AMENDMENT OF IN ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS SLEEK -- ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM THE FIRST PROPOSED SIX MONTHS OF AND THEN WAIT WITH DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNTY PA THEIR PREFERRED THE EIGHT MONTH -- SO THOUSAND MOMENT YEAH SO SO INITIALLY -- DE IT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL BILLS -- THE TIME FRAME WAS A YEAR AND SO -- THE APPROPRIATIONS STAFF FELT IT WAS YOU KNOW MORE EFFICIENT TO REDUCE IT TO EIGHTY TWO TO EIGHT MONTHS. BOTH FOR ACCOUNTABILITY -- YOU KNOW -- YOU KIND OF GET THE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF O OF OF OF THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE ALLOCATED AND TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT -- OF THESE PROJECTS WERE GOING TO BE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE PROJECT APPLICANTS. WERE WE KNOW WHAT IT HERE -- TO YOU KNOW THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW ADVANCE THEY'RE PLANNING WHEN IT CAME TO THE EXPENSE OF THESE FUNDS BUT FISCALLY THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE I MEAN YOU'RE DOING YOU'VE GOT. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WORKING ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES TO ARBITRARILY SAY THAT YOU HAVE. TO DO ALL YOUR PLANNING GRANT WITHIN SIX MONTHS DOESN'T REFLECT THE WORK THAT'S ON THE GROUND. I MEAN HOW WITH THE HOW THE WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS OTHER THAN JUST. BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FOLKS THEY MAY NOT BE READY IN SIX MONTHS AND YOU HAVE YOUR GRANT. PUSH OR ANY CONSIDERATION FOR WHAT YOUR PARTNERS BECAUSE NORMALLY AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUP IS PARTNERING WITH SOME. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ENGINEERS TECHNICIANS YET AT THAT. JUST TO SAY THE GRANT YOU HAVE TO SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY IN THE GRANT MAY NOT. REFLECT REALITY IT WAS NOT THE WHOLE GRAND -- THAT'S FOR THE FIRST ARE THE 50% ADVANCE PAYMENT AND THEN AFTER THAT THE EIGHT MONTHS THEY'LL HAVE SOME REPORTING TO DO AND THEN THEY WOULD. BE GIVEN AND ANOTHER 50%. SO IT'S NOT EIGHT MONTHS FOR THE WHOLE GRANT AMOUNT. IT'S ONLY 50% OF THE EVENTS HI. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IN. I CONDITION THAT SET THàNH TO PEOPLE THAT TYPICALLY ARE NOT WELL ORGANIZED AND YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THIS COMMUNITY TO GET THEM ORGANIZED TO PUT ANOTHER CONDITION ON THERE IN THE APPEARANCE THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO GET RESULTS -- I I GUESS. FROM A PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW I WOULD I WOULD CAUTION CAL EPA ON ON LETTING OUT THE MONEY IN ADVANCE THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS TO ME IS THAT. IT GOES UP 250% SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE. HAPPEN LESS MONEY DEPENDING ON WHAT THE GRANT YES WHICH IS. YOU KNOW SORT OF DEFEATING WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE WHOLE THING IS BUT I WILL -- LEAVE IT THERE. DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND AT ALL. YOU KNOW I THINK -- SO THIS WAS ADDRESSED AS WELL ON A PREVIOUS COMMITTEE ND I THINK IT IS A POINT WELL TAKEN YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE YOU KNOW THE TIME MEAN AND YOU KNOW I WOULD HOPE THAT FOLKS THAT ARE% PLANNED FOR THESE FUNDS THAT. YOU KNOW IN PREPARATION AND AND AND AND APPLY FOR SUCH FUNDS THAT THEY ANTICIPATE YOU KNOW. THE TIME FRAME YOU KNOW AND THE LONGEVITY OF HOW LONG THESE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO TAKE -- AND SO CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW I I YOU KNOW I AGREE IT IS A CONCERN BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES BUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR THE SMALL ORGANIZATIONS AND AND THE SMALL NONPROFITS. TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THESE IMPORTANT BY MIDDLE JUSTICE ISSUES THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW BEING HANDLED -- AS LOCALLY AS POSSIBLE. IT WITH THAT THAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SISTER MOTION.
