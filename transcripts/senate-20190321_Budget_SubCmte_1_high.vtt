00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.373
THAT.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.308
I'M A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.244
THE FUNDS WORK TO SUPPORT.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.146
NEW RESIDENCY SLOTS AND WHAT

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.948
THAT MEANS OUR IS SLOTS --

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.950
THE KIND OF GROWTH IN EXISTING

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.518
PROGRAMS --

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.387
AND THEN THE OTHER REMAINING

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.655
PORTION WAS.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:09.656
FOR THE KIND OF SUSTAINED

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.457
EXISTING SLOTS AND AN EXISTING

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:12.592
PROGRAM SO THAT WASN'T THAT

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.160
DOESN'T REFLECT GROWTH THAT'S

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.061
KIND OF SUSTAINING THE SLOTS

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:18.932
THAT THE THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:20.233
SOME SENSE --

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.734
AS TO HOW THE FUNDS MIGHT BE

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.536
SPENT ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.437
I'M SO I THOUGHT THAT

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:25.538
INFORMATION MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.240
I'M HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER ANY

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.041
OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.375
ON THIS ITEM DO YOU FIND A

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:30.310
PROBLEM WITH THAT [inaudible]

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.478
BREAKDOWN.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.413
WHAT?

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.581
IN WITH REGARD TO THE EXISTING

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.149
SLOT SO I THINK THE THE KEY

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.451
QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT IS THE

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:39.152
PURPOSE --

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.187
SOME PROGRAMS MIGHT HAVE A HARD

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.122
TIME SUSTAINING SLOTS IF THEY

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.057
RUN OUT OF FUNDING OR IF THEY

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:44.824
DON'T.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.060
QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL FUNDING SAY

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.761
FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY DON'T --

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:50.863
PROVIDE INPATIENT SERVICES OR IF

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.231
THEY DON'T SERVE AND AN OLDER

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.600
POPULATION THAT'S GENERALLY

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:54.734
SERVED BY MEDICARE.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.036
THEN EXISTING THOUGHTS MIGHT

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.138
HELP SUSTAIN SOME OF THOSE --

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:00.773
RESIDENCY BASS LOTS BUT TO THE

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.475
EXTENT THAT THERE JUST HOLDING A

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.711
FLAT IT MIGHT NOT BE ADDRESSING --

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.079
SHORTAGES THAT EXIST IN THE

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.680
STATE SO THATTHAT'S KIND OF A A

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.182
KEY QUESTION TO CONSIDER IF

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:09.782
YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:10.617
THIS DATA.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.251
WELL MAYBE AS WE MOVE THROUGH

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:15.722
THE THE PANEL THIS CAN CAN

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.357
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AS WELL.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.325
I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD I CAN

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.227
UNDERSTAND COVERING EXISTING

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.229
RESIDENCIES WHEN [inaudible]

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.898

OUT OF THE BACK AND AND THEN.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.404
AND THEN SO WE HAD A WE HAD AND

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.373
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A NET INCREASE

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.940
IN MONEY I GUESS IS WHAT I'M

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:34.907
SAYING.

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.876
BUT NOW WITH THE MONEY RESTORED

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.646
I THINK TO UC.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.247
AND THEN FORTY MILLION ON TOP

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.782
MAYBE SOMEONE COULD ADDRESS THE

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.183
USE OF THAT MONEY FOR EXISTING

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.685

THE DISTRIBUTION OR THE

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.622

AND BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:08.554
ISSUES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO BE

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.323
ADDRESSED IN IN FUTURE YEARS WE

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:12.692

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:23.302
LINE -- FOR

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:24.804
ADVERTISING TO GRANTEES AND HAVE

WERE TAUGHT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.191
WHICH I THINK.

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:47.026
BODES WELL FOR SAYING THIS MONEY

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.828
NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:50.730
ALLOCATED EVERY YEAR --

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:53.332
TO THIS PROGRAM SO THAT --

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:56.202
YOU KNOW WE CAN BEGIN TO TO TO

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.705
HAVE A STEADY WAY OF OF MEETING

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:01.140
SOME OF IT THE DEMAND OF THAT

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.408
STATE.

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:03.943
OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION --

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.244
ALSO SAY THAT PART OF THE

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.246
DECISION --

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:08.014
TO AND YOU LOOK AT THE

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.981
DISTRIBUTION OR SOME NEW

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.449
PROGRAMS AND SOME EXISTING

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:11.284
PROGRAMS.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.151
EXISTING --

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.586
GRADUATE GRADUATE MEDICAL

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.987
EDUCATION PROGRAMS CAN BE --

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:16.489
FUNDED THROUGH A NUMBER OF

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:18.424
DIFFERENT SOURCES IT'S NOT JUST

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:20.960
ONE SOURCE MANY MANY EXISTING

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.561
PROGRAMS RUN THROUGH GRANTS FROM

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.397
FROM PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS THERE

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:26.432
MAYBE FEDERAL GRANTS ARE USED SO

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.233
GO.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.436
AND MAYBE SOME INSTITUTIONAL

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:30.736
MONEY -- THE

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:33.706
SERVICE --

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:36.075
FUNDED SO WE THOUGHT THAT.

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:39.245
WELL THE GOAL TO EXPAND IS OUT

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.647
OF A GOAL AND TO ADD NEW SLOT WE

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:42.848
DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE SLOTS THAT

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:45.117
COULD POTENTIALLY BE IN JEOPARDY

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:47.720
OR NOT FIND IT SO THAT'S WHY YOU

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:48.854
SEE THAT MIX.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.790
ALSO SO SO THE EXISTING

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:53.726
RESIDENCY SLOTS WERE AT RISK OF

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:54.593
LOSING FUNDING.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.262
FROM SOME PROGRAM PERHAPS OTHER

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:59.465
THAN SOME ROUND OR RIGHT RIGHT.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.768
I SEE RIGHT EXACTLY SIR SO I

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.637
THINK THAT THAT OVERALL THE THE

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.339
TAKE AWAY WITH A LOT OF WORK TO

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:07.139
DO.

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:09.375
IN YEAR TWO GOING FORWARD YOU

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.444
IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW A GREAT NEED

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.714
IN IN IN TERMS OF PSYCHIATRY --

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.915
WE WE DO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.216
HAS PUT SOME MONEY IN THE BUDGET

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.818
FOR PSYCHIATRY I DON'T THINK I

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.586
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:22.254
MAYBE THIS COMMITTEE WILL OFFER

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.557
INTEREST FOR PSYCHIATRY --

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:25.992
WORK FORCE MAYBE --

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:27.760
THAT'S A SOURCE BUT I I DO THINK

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:30.096
THAT THIS PROGRAM THE INTEGRITY

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:35.301
OF THE ADVISORY GROUP IN AND THE

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:35.868
THE BOARD IN UNIVERSITY OF

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:39.372
REALLY WORKED HARD. TO ESTABLISH

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:42.975
AT AT A GOOD PROGRAM AND

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:44.243
HOPEFULLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR TO

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.578
YEAR WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD ON

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:47.346
THE SUCCESSES I'M VERY PLEASED

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:48.481
WITH WHAT --

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:49.115
WITH THE PROGRESS THAT YOU MADE

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:52.184
AND YOU I MEAN.

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.085
THERE IS A NEED UP INTO A

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.086
TREMENDOUS NEED UP AND DOWN THE

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.554
STATE FOR PRIMARY CARE

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.656
PHYSICIANS AND AND THOSE.

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:58.958
PRACTICE AREAS THAT ARE RELATED

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.026
TO THAT --

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:01.360
AND THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH MONEY

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:02.695
SO WE JUST.

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.196
NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIND

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:07.500
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO FUND

AND AS SHIA NARROW AND THE

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.989
INLAND EMPIRE THERE REALLY IS A

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:20.593
DIRE NEED. FOR PHYSICIANS AS

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:22.995
WELL AS FOR RESIDENCY TRAINING

KEEP THEM IN THE STATE OF

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:35.741
CALIFORNIA.

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:38.410
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN.

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:40.813
AND I'LL GOAL IS.

IN THE INLAND EMPIRE.

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:51.323
SO THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY REMAIN

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.525
IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHERE THERE

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:56.695
IS A DIRE NEED FOR POSITION.

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:58.697
I HOPE THEY DO.

00:14:58.764 --> 00:15:00.733
WE DO NEED THEM.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:04.203
OKAY IS THAT FINISH PROP

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:04.503
[inaudible]

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:09.742
FIFTY SIX ABOUT [inaudible]

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:12.845
OKAY -- LET

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:14.079
ME BEFORE I BEGAN ASK.

00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:16.282
WHETHER.

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:20.286
YOU BY CHANCE WE HAVE COPIES.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:21.520
I I'M.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.988
FIVE WE'LL REFER TO THIS --

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:25.024
AS I PROVIDE A FEW HIGHLIGHTS A

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.627
AND I THINK I'D LIKE TO MAKE --

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:32.031
FIVE THE IMPETUS FOR OUR UC

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.432
PRIME PROGRAMS.

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:34.967
BEGAN ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:38.003
AND IT WAS A STRATEGY --

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.905
FOR EXPANDING MEDICAL SCHOOL IN

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:40.939
ROMAN OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:42.641
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS FOR THE

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.677
FIRST TIME IN DECADES SO THIS.

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:50.049
PREDATES THE TRANSITION MEDICINE

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.750
AND OUR OUR THINKING REALLY WAS

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.719
THAT WE COULD ACCOMMODATE SOME

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.321
GROWTH WITHIN EXISTING MEDICAL

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:56.255
SCHOOLS.

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:56.989
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE FULL

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.424
COMPLEMENT OF BASIC SCIENCES AND

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.892
CLINICAL SCIENCES AND

00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.427
ACCREDITATION OF THOSE SCHOOLS.

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:02.995
BUT ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:05.631
GROWTH WOULD BE POSSIBLE BASED

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:07.466
UPON SPACING CAPITAL NEEDS --

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.001
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:12.037
AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:13.739
SEE -- TATE

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:14.807
DEVELOPED SOME INNOVATIVE

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:17.676
PROGRAMS THAT WE FELT --

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:20.012
WOULD SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:23.749
NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICALLY

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.851
WAS A STRATEGIC DECISION SYSTEM

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.086
WIDE DECISION.

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:28.887
WITH LOCA AUTHORITY BY THE

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.823
DEANS AND BY THE FACULTY AND WE

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:32.491
HAD SOME GRANT SUPPORT EARLY ON

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:34.660
TO ASSIST WITH PLANNING WE

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:35.661
VETTED THIS WITH OUR UNIVERSITY

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:37.363
OF CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP AT THAT

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:39.331
TIME WITH WITH STATE LEADERSHIP

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:40.899
AT THAT TIME AND AGAIN THIS IS.

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:42.468
PRE RECESSION BUT IT WAS A

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.837
STRATEGIC AN INITIATIVE AGAIN

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:47.206
TAKE INCREASE CLASS SIZE BUT TO

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:49.241
DO IT IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY --

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:51.510
WE WERE POST PROPOSITION TWO OH

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:52.044
NINE WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.879
DIVERSITY OF THE STATE AND WE

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.381
THOUGHT ABOUT --

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:58.417
ELEMENTS OF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:00.152
SEEK TO RECRUIT STUDENTS AND

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:02.087
THEN RETURN STUDENTS TO THOSE

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:03.489
COMMUNITIES OF GREATEST NEED.

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:06.091
SO WE IDENTIFIED --

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.860
SIX CORE ELEMENTS FOR EACH OF

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:09.528
OUR PRIME PROGRAMS YOU SEE THEM.

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:10.929
YOU SEE THEM LISTED IN TERMS OF

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:12.598
THEIR SPACE AND IN TERMS OF

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:13.932
THEIR NAME --

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:15.134
BUT WE ASK --

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.602
WITH THE PLANNING MONIES THAT

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:18.437
WERE PROVIDED FOR EACH DEAN'S

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:21.940
OFFICE. TO IDENTIFY A UNIQUE

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:25.344
AREA OF FOCUS THE STUDENTS TO

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.246
FACULTY TO OTHERS.

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:30.215
WE ASK EACH CAMPUS TO PLANT A

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:31.550
STUDENT OUTREACH --

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:34.653
AND RECRUITMENT STRATEGY TO SEEK

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.588
TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS --

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:39.725
LIKELY. TO WANT TO RETURN TO THE

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:41.827
COMMUNITY TO THE AREA OF FOCUS

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.462
THAT WE WERE LOOKING TO ADVANCE.

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:44.797
WE ASK -- I

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:46.365
DO A LOT OF WORK IN MEDICAL

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:48.133
SCHOOL ADMISSIONS AND KNOW THE

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.635
COMPLEXITY AND THE VOLUME.

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:51.870
SO WE ASK EACH PROGRAM TO

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:54.239
IDENTIFY SUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:56.241
MOST OF OUR PRIME STUDENTS HAVE

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:56.875
TO BE ADMITTED TO A UC MEDICAL

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:58.076
SCHOOL --

00:17:58.143 --> 00:17:59.077
AND THEN THEIRSUPPLEMENTAL

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:00.179
CRITERIA TO ASSESS

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.880
QUALIFICATIONS TO BE ADMITTED TO

00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:04.082
R. PRIME PROGRAMS I'M SO THIS IS

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:05.684
ABOUT STUDENT FIT.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:09.188
ON WE WE ASK AND MINDFUL OF HOW

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:10.789
IMPACTED THE MEDICAL SCHOOL

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:12.691
CURRICULUM IS THERE ARE

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.560
INTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS AND WANT

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.094
TO STUDENTS TO SUCCEED.

00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:17.496
I'M SO THIS IS NOT A REWRITE OF

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:19.231
THE CURRICULUM IT'S IT'S

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:21.633
INCREMENTAL ENHANCEMENT --

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.536
SO WE ASK --

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:27.606
THAT. FOR EACH PROGRAM HAND SMIT

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:29.041
IN THE PRECLINICAL YEARS THIS IS

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:30.275
ONE STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:32.344
BASIC SCIENCES SO EXAMPLES MIGHT

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:34.213
BE INSTRUCTION OR LECTURES ON

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:36.281
DISPARITIES IN HEALTH STATUS --

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:38.484
THERE IS AN EXAMPLE. FOR IRVINE

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.818
PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON THE

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:41.019
LATINO COMMUNITY THIS IF THIS

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:41.854
INCLUDED ADDITIONAL

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.388
OPPORTUNITIES IN IN MEDICAL

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:45.190
SPANISH --

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:46.725
IN THE CLINICAL CLERKSHIP HERE'S

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.660
THE THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR WE ASK

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:50.362
THAT SPECIAL ATTENTION BE MADE

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:51.997
TO PLACE OUR PRIME STUDENTS.

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:54.600
IN THOSE AREAS THAT WOULD END.

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.201
CREATE THEIR SKILL SET FOR

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:57.135
FUTURE PRACTICE IN THOSE

00:18:57.202 --> 00:18:58.804
SETTINGS AND THEN WE ASK FOR

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:00.239
CLEAR FACULTY MENTOR SHIP THE

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:03.642
DECISION MAKING WAS LOCAL --

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:04.910
YOU'LL SEE EXAMPLES THAT ARE

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:07.145
LISTED THAT ARE HERE --

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:09.915
WE HAVE SIX PRIME PROGRAMS IN

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.917
THE UC SYSTEMNOW WITH A TOTAL

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.586
ENROLLMENT OF THREE HUNDRED AND

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.488
FIFTY FOUR STUDENTS THIS IS OVER.

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:18.657
ALL PROGRAMS AND OVER ALL YEARS

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:19.858
OF THE PROGRAM SO MEDICAL

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.293
SCHOOLS A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM BY

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.728
AND LARGE.

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:24.129
AMONG THOSE.

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:27.165
STUDENTS 64% I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT --

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:28.901
THIS MOSTLY BECAUSE I LIVE IN

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:30.869
THIS SPACE BUT 64% OF THE

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:32.237
STUDENTS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:33.372
IN MEDICINE.

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:35.541
SO THIS LOOKS LIKE --

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:37.509
A LEVEL OF DIVERSITY THAT IS

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:38.810
MUCH NEEDED IN A STATE LIKE

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:41.146
CALIFORNIA BUT IT BUT THAT IS

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:43.248
REALLY HE SELDOM SEEN.

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:44.983
AMONG U. S. MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.952
WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO THE

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:49.821
IDENTITY OF THE PROGRAM AND WE I

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.189
ATTRIBUTED.

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:53.058
TO OUTREACH AND TO THE ELEMENTS

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.693
THAT I'VE DESCRIBED FOR EACH SO

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.995
I I WON'T GO INTO DETAILS FOR

00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:57.529
EACH.

00:19:57.596 --> 00:20:00.632
BUT OUR ROLE PRIME PROGRAMS AT

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:02.301
DAVIS IS ALIGNED WITH THE

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.001
MISSION OF THE DAVIS MEDICAL

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:05.003
SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE RECRUITED

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.338
FROM RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:09.107
PROGRAMS AS AN OUTREACH STRATEGY.

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:10.108
STUDENTS GET TAUGHT ABOUT

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:11.209
DISPARITIES FACING RURAL

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:12.844
COMMUNITIES STUDENTS GET

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:14.346
PREFERENTIAL --

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:15.914
INSTRUCTION IN TELEMEDICINE IS A

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:17.549
STRATEGY FOR INCREASING THEIR

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:19.117
SKILL SET --

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:21.420
WE HAVE A PRIME LC PROGRAM DOWN

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:24.957
AT UCI THE FIRST IN THE SYSTEM --

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:27.492
TOP OPEN WHERE --

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.161
STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED TO THE

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:30.829
MEDICAL SCHOOL.

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:31.930
BUT THEN HAVE SOME TYPE OF

INCREASE CLASS SIZE.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.345
WE HAD -- TO

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:22.247
BEGIN TO RECRUIT THERE WAS A LOT

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:24.082
OF INVESTMENT IN THE TWO OR

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:25.083
THREE YEARS LEADING TO THE

ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST CLASS.

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:27.953
AND THEN THE STATE'S ECONOMY

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.689
BEGAN TO UNRAVEL ON SO THAT THE

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.057
MISSION WAS GOOD THE AIM WAS

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.925
GREAT THE ENTHUSIASM WAS HIDE

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:36.495
THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:37.896
DID NOT ALIGN EIGHT IN ANY

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.998
FAVORABLY WAY SO OUR SCHOOL'S

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:41.933
MOVE FORWARD KID MET THEIR FIRST

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.335

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:53.845
HAPPENED AGAIN IS SORT OF SHOWN

00:21:53.912 --> 00:21:58.684
HERE THE FIRST PRIME PROGRAM IN

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.954
TWO THOUSAND ON AND SOMEBODY --

00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:06.058
WAS A SEVEN I THINK IT'S SEVEN

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:07.626
MAYBE IT WAS SIX WITH IT WAS THE

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:09.294
FIRST THAT WE HAD DAVIS SAN

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:11.029

ROLLING THEIR FIRST CLASSES.

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:15.333
AND WE HAD THREE YEARS OF PLAN

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.536
FUNDING SO WE WE CAME TO THE

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:18.704
STATE.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.604
FUNDING AS OUR CLASS SIZES

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.406
INCREASED THESE WERE INTENDED TO

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:23.442
BE TWELVE STUDENTS TO FIFTEEN

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:25.210
STUDENTS PER CLASS IN PRIME.

WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:28.380
MISSION AND AND THEN YOU SEE THE

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:30.382
EFFECTS OF OF THE STATE BUDGET

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:32.484
AND MULTI YEAR CUTS IN UC

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:34.219
FUNDING FOR HIGHER ED OVERALL SO

00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:35.954
WE'VE BEEN FROZEN WE RECOGNIZE

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.489
THE NEED TO COME BACK TO SECURE

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:41.126
THIS FUNDING --

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.227
AND THEY'RE OF SIMPLY BAN.

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:42.961
AN ENSUING NUMBER OF DIFFICULT

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:44.129
BUDGET YEARS AND COMPETING

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:46.364
PRIORITIES --

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:46.965
FOR FOR THE STATE AND FOR THE

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.867
SYSTEM -- SO

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:50.702
WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:52.504
REGULAR SLOTS THE THESE ARE

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:54.339
ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS --

00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:56.675
WE'VE GRADUATED FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:57.843
SEVENTY STUDENTS --

00:22:57.909 --> 00:23:00.178
TO DATE BUT ONLY SEVENTY EIGHT

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:01.813
OF OUR TOTAL COMPLEMENT OF PRIME

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.315
POSITIONS ACROSS.

00:23:03.381 --> 00:23:04.683
OUR SYSTEM --

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.485
HAVE THE BENEFIT OF GENERAL FUND

00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.886
SUPPORT SO THIS IS MARGINAL

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:10.222
GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR MEDICAL

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:11.823
STUDENTS WHICH IS A HIGHER RATE.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.692
THAN FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:15.026
IT DOES NOT COVER THE COST OF

00:23:15.093 --> 00:23:17.462
INSTRUCTION THE STUDENTS STILL

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:19.030
PAY TUITION.

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:19.664
PROFESSIONAL GRADE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:21.633
TUITION AND MANY STILL END UP

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.502
WITH SUBSTANTIAL DEBT TO HELP SO

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.437
THE FUNDING RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:27.172
STATE OF THE BUDGET IN THE PAST

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.007
AND WITH THEM THE FUNDING LEVELS

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:30.075
THAT YOU RECEIVED.

00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:31.910
HOW ARE ALL OF THE PRIME SO IT'S

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:35.013
FUN IS IT DOES IT COME OUT OF

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.248
THE WHOLE SYSTEM?

00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:37.883
NOW MONEY ON IT YOU KNOW IT

00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:39.484
COMES FROM YOU KNOW WE WE

00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:41.086
INVESTED --

00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:42.554
POLITICAL CAPITAL WITH

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:44.356
FOUNDATIONS AS THESE PROGRAMS

00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:45.624
WERE LAUNCHED.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.926
THERE WITH LOCAL ENTHUSIASM

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:49.327
THERE WAS DEAN'S LEVEL

00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:51.496
COMMITMENT TO TO MOVE FORWARD

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:52.864
THERE WAS THE HOPE OF RETURNING

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:53.565
ANNA.

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:54.800
I DON'T THINK ANY NEAR TERM

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:57.035
OPTIMISM IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:57.669
THAT THE RECESSION WAS ABOUT TO

00:23:57.736 --> 00:23:58.737
END -- BUT

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.138
WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO KEEP

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:02.374
A CRITICAL MASS OF IDENTITY.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.475
SO.

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.911
SOME MEDICAL SCHOOLS HAVE --

00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:07.512
PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:08.914
CALIFORNIAN DOWNS MINUTES FOR

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.881
THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:13.185
FOUNDATION IS NOT A SUPPORTER

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:14.219
SOME HAVE HAD --

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.320
DEAN'S RESERVES.

00:24:15.387 --> 00:24:17.589
SOME SCHOOLS DECREASE THEIR CORE

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:19.357
CLASS SIZE TO ACCOMMODATE A

00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:21.159
CRITICAL MASS OF PRIME STUDENTS

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:22.694
IT'S BEEN A COMBINATION.

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:24.529
AND IT'S BEEN A I YOU KNOW IT'S

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:27.265
BEEN A NEGOTIATION I WILL SAY.

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:29.401
AT TIMES OF LEADERSHIP CHANGE AT

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:32.604
TIMES OF ECONOMIC STRESS ARMS

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:34.673
WHAT'S IN NEEDED IS TO SUSTAIN

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:36.208
THE PROMINENT INCREASING CLASS

00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:37.876
SIZE THAT WE THOUGHT.

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:39.678
WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE

00:24:39.744 --> 00:24:40.979
ISSUE THAT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT

00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:43.381
WITH WITH YOU SEE OUR AND TO NOT

00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:45.851
HAVE THE FUNDS AT RISK OF

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:47.285
COMPETING PRIORITIES.

00:24:47.352 --> 00:24:50.589
JUST AS A AS A AS A DEDICATED --

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.490
PART OF USING ICLOUD WAS SEEMS

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:54.326
LIKE AN ESSENTIAL PROGRAM OF THE

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:56.194
THE EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION

00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:59.698
THAT'S REFERENCED IN THE AGENDA

00:24:59.764 --> 00:25:03.501
WILL THAT FULLY FUND THE IT IT

00:25:03.568 --> 00:25:04.669
WILL FORM THE TWO HUNDRED AND

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:06.638
FIFTY SLOT SYSTEM WIDE THAT HAVE

00:25:06.705 --> 00:25:08.940
NO GENERAL FUND SUPPORT.

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:10.709
IT'LL FIND THOSE SLOTS AT A

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:12.611
LEVEL OF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:14.512
DOLLARS PER STUDENT WHICH DOES

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:16.615
NOT COVER THE COST OF MEDICAL

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:17.415
EDUCATION.

00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:21.253
THIS WAS THE LAST RECOGNIZED

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:22.721
FIGURE -- BY

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:23.788
THE STATE THEY CAME IN

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:25.523
CONNECTION WITH THE FUNDING FOR

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.092
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PRIME PROGRAM.

00:25:27.158 --> 00:25:28.493
SO OUR SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PRIME

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.928
PROGRAM BENEFITS --

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:31.096
THROUGH A STATE BUDGET

00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:33.899
AUGMENTATION FOR TWELVE STUDENTS

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:35.600
PER YEAR WHICH IS THE SIZE OF

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:36.968
MOST OF OUR PRIME PROGRAMS

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:39.437
ACROSS FOUR YEARS MAKING IT.

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:42.908
FORTY EIGHT SO THERE'S THIRTY

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:43.541
FIVE THOUSAND SO WE USE THAT AS

00:25:43.608 --> 00:25:46.244
A BASELINE FOR MARGINAL COST

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:47.145
INCREASES.

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:49.514
SO THIS WILL SECURE THE PROGRAMS

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:51.883
IN PERPETUITY IN ADDITION TO

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.786
THOSE FUNDS STUDENTS PAY --

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:55.921
PROFESSIONAL DEGREE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:25:55.987 --> 00:25:58.123
TUITION TWO THIRDS OF WHICH IS

00:25:58.189 --> 00:25:59.424
USED TO SUPPORT INSTRUCTION IN

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:00.592
THIS PROGRAM IT'S THE SAME

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:02.060
AMOUNT PAID BY ALL YOU SEE

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:04.796
MEDICAL STUDENTS IN THE RANGE OF

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:05.397
EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN THOUSAND

00:26:05.463 --> 00:26:06.898
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:07.532
A THIRD OF WHICH IS RETURNED TO

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:09.200
AID.

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:10.535
SEEMS LIKE A MODEST REQUEST TO

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:11.369
ME.

00:26:11.436 --> 00:26:12.737
IT'S A MODEST REQUEST BY ANY

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:14.139
MEANS AND MIGHT BE USED YOUR

00:26:14.205 --> 00:26:16.675
STRATEGIC PLANS TO THEY INCLUDE --

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:20.612
AN EXPANSION OF MAYBE REFERENCES.

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:21.680
BLOW THROUGH MY HEAD THE NEXT.

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:23.348
EXPANSION THE PRIME PROGRAM IN

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:25.684
THE FUTURE SO THERE ARE A COUPLE

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.985
OF THINGS AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:28.420
QUESTION I WANT I WANT TO BE

00:26:28.486 --> 00:26:29.921
MINDFUL OF TIME --

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:33.525
ARE THE FUNDING REQUEST OF EIGHT

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.460
THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE TWO

HUNDRED AND FIFTY ON FUNDED

00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:37.963

REGION'S BUDGET --

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:43.868
UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:45.670
INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:47.105
JANUARY BUDGET --

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:48.773

THERE IS --

00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:57.849
CONSIDERABLE INTEREST I WILL SAY

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:59.551
MY MANY STAKEHOLDERS IN SEEING

00:26:59.617 --> 00:27:01.086

HAVE A PRIME FOR EVERY NEED AND

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:18.203
THERE'S CONSIDERABLE NEED IN THE

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.837
STATE.

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:20.405
AND IT WAS A FUNCTION OF OF OF

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:21.973
DECISION MAKING OUT THAT SIDE AT

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.575
THAT TIME SO WE HAVE ONE THAT'S

00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:26.011
REGIONALLY IDENTIFIED WE COULD

00:27:26.077 --> 00:27:27.612
CERTAINLY HAVE MORE THAN.

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:29.280
ONE WORLD PRIME MORE THAN ONE

00:27:29.347 --> 00:27:30.949
URBAN PRIME WE DON'T HAVE ALL

00:27:31.016 --> 00:27:32.183
PRIME --

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.952
THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS --

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:36.388
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:38.857
ABOUT A PRIME PROGRAM FOR UC

00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:41.092
RIVERSIDE UC RIVERSIDE BEFORE IT

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:42.093
BECAME AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.396
SCHOOL HAD A VERY SMALL PRIME

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:46.765
PROGRAM IN CONJUNCTION WITH UCLA.

00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:48.299
HI HOW ARE YOU FEELING SCHOOL OF

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.268
MEDICINE WITH THE LAST PROGRAM

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.736
TO OPEN ITS PRIME PROGRAM AND

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:53.905
THEREFORE HAS NO FUNDING FOR ITS

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:55.673
PRIME PROGRAM IN ENTIRETY --

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.875
WHEN THE RIVERSIDE PROGRAM

00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:59.477
OPENED THE MISSION WAS CLEARLY

00:27:59.544 --> 00:28:00.845
ALL ALIGNED WITH THE MISSION OF

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:03.081
PRIME SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:04.115
THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED NEEDS

00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:05.717
OF THE INLAND EMPIRE?

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:07.185
AND I THINK THE DECISION AT THAT

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:09.621
TIME WAS TO NOT SUSTAIN A SMALL

00:28:09.687 --> 00:28:11.189
FOR STUDENT PROGRAM TIME THE

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:12.457
SCHOOL WAS ATTEMPTING TO

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:14.025
ESTABLISH ITSELF INDEPENDENTLY.

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:15.693
SO WE HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.128
TALK ABOUT A PRIME PROGRAM

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.797
INCLUDING AN AREA OF FOCUS AND

00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:20.398
HOW THAT MIGHT WORK --

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:23.101
I I SPENT A HALF A DAY A COUPLE

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:24.436
OF WEEKS AGO WITH THE DEAN AND

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:25.937
HER SENIOR TEAM TALKING ABOUT

00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:26.805
THAT.

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:28.006
THERE IS INTEREST IN A POSSIBLE

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:32.343
EXPANSION OF PRIME PROGRAM IN

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.113
CONNECTION WITH THE JOINT

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.448
MEDICAL PROGRAM --

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:37.949
THEY COULD HAVE SOME EXPANSION

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:39.284
AND COULD BE A UNIQUE --

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.586
ADDITION SO THIS WOULD BE A TWO

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.822
YEAR THIS WITH AND FOLLOW --

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:46.024
IF IF THERE WERE THE WISHES AND

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:48.026
I THINK THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE

00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:49.194
HEALTH COMMISSION WAS A ON

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.296
ANOTHER AMONG THOSE ENTITIES

00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:53.331
THAT WANTED TO SEE.

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:55.567
SOME CAPABILITY TO GROW BEYOND

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:57.102
THE CURRENT ENROLLMENT IN OUR

00:28:57.168 --> 00:28:59.637
PRIME PROGRAM AND OUR OUR VIEW

00:28:59.704 --> 00:29:00.438
REALLY WAS.

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:01.973
AT THE CAMPUS LEADERSHIP LEVEL

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.308
AND IN OAKLAND AND WITH THE

00:29:03.374 --> 00:29:04.742
PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT THAT OUR

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:06.344
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS NEEDED

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:07.679
TO SECURE AND NEEDED TO BE TO

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.914
SECURE AND TO SUSTAIN THE SPOTS.

00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:11.516
AND THEN TO TAKE A YEAR TO TO

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.751
SEE WHAT NUMBER OF POSITIONS AND

00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:15.120
AREAS MAY BE POSSIBLE --

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:17.055
SO THAT COULD THAT COULD BE MET

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:17.856
WITH THE YEAR TWO FUNDING

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.390

AND IT'S BEYOND GREAT UP AND

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.271
DOWN THE STATE AND I KNOW THE

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:36.808
ADMINISTRATION REALIZES THAT AND

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.443

IS STILL DEBATING OPTIONS.

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:53.276
OPTIONS TO CHANGE.

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:54.911

OUR E. BUT TOOK TO CREATE SOME

00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:01.751
KIND OF SAVINGS SO THAT WE WE

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:04.654

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:08.591
RAPID INCREASE IN THE PAY AS YOU

LOOK YOU'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS.

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.164
YES WHAT WHAT WE'RE ON PENSIONS

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.666
MAY I MAKE A COMMENT.

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:17.801
WE'LL KEEP WILL KEEP YOU ON THE

00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:19.936
SAME SUBJECT MATTER --

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:24.374
SO I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.742
FOUR OH THREE B. PLAN WHICH IS

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:27.243
SIMILAR TO A FOUR OH ONE K. PLAN.

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:28.378
THAT YOU'RE OFFERING TO NEW

00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:29.612
EMPLOYEES --

00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:31.114
I REMAIN CONCERNED FOR TWO

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:34.083
REASONS. ONE IS A FOUR OH THREE

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:35.785
B. OR FOUR ONE K. PLAN PUTS ALL

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:38.254
THE RISK ON THE FUTURE RETIREE

00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:41.057
BECAUSE IT'S DEPENDENT UPON THE

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:41.791
STOCK MARKET.

00:57:41.858 --> 00:57:43.259
AND THEN SECONDLY WHAT I WORRY

00:57:43.326 --> 00:57:44.627
ABOUT IS WHEN YOU HAVE NEW

00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:46.329
PEOPLE COMING IN AND THEY DO NOT

00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:47.964
THEY ARE PART OF A DEFINED

00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:49.065
BENEFIT CONTRIBUTION.

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:51.901
IT HARMS THOSE THAT ARE IN THE

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.203
CONTRIBUTION.

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:54.671
BECAUSE THERE'S NO NEW REVENUE

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:56.706
BEING GENERATED AND AND BEING

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:58.241
PUT INTO THAT FUND.

00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.142
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:02.011
CHOICE BUT I JUST WORRY THAT THE

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:04.113
UC IS TRYING TO PHASE OUT THE

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.515
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:08.484
AND WORK MORE WITH A FOUR OH

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:11.821
THREE B. R. FOUR ONE K. PLAN.

YES SENATOR I UNDERSTAND YOUR

00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:15.158
CONCERNS --

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:17.594
CURRENTLY EMPLOYEES IF THEY DO

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.828
NOT MAKE A SELECTION TO A

00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:21.397
DEFAULT THE TRADITIONAL PLAN.

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:23.499
OF ALSO WE ARE CHARGING ALL OUR

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:27.270
CAMPUSES THAT 6% OF EXTRA FEE ON

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:29.038
ALSO THOSE EMPLOYEE WHO GO INTO

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:31.241
THE FOR ONE CASE STYLE PLAN.

00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:32.709
THAT GETS PUT INTO TO A

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.744
TRADITIONAL. TO THE DOOR I'M

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:36.379
BENEFIT TO THE DEFINED BENEFIT

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:39.349
PLAN. TO KEEP THAT PLAN HEALTHY

00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:41.918
AND MAKE UP THAT SHORTFALL IN

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:43.853
FUNDING THERE CURRENTLY OKAY

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.088
THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT

MILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE TO COVER

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:06.482

SALARY WAS MOVED THE MOST OFTEN

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.831
CITED REASON WHY OUR FACULTY

THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:27.850
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY BASED ON

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:29.685

WITH TWO OF OUR UNIONS CURRENTLY.

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:39.628

I THINK THAT THAT THAT SOUNDS

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.286
GOOD -- BUT

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:05.487
I WOULD ALSO THINK THAT IT MAKES

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:08.190
SENSE -- TO

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:09.692

BUT CLEARLY IF THEY'RE ON STRIKE

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:28.143
IT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE THINKING

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:29.044
THEY DESERVE.

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:30.913
SO.

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:33.348

THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PER OF

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:06.482
FUNDS THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:08.283
OF THE USES WHEN A REQUEST

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:09.952

SO THERE ARE. THREE ISSUES

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:23.398
BEFORE YOU WHEN THIS ITEM THE

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:26.969
FIRST IS A RESIDENT ROMAN IN

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:27.536
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:29.872
SECOND IS RESIDENT ROLE MEANT IN

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:30.472
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND IN

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:31.273
FUTURE YEARS.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.841
ON THE THIRD ISSUE IS NON

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:34.610
RESIDENT ROMANCE ALL TOUCH ON

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.011
EACH ISSUE.

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.179
WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST ISSUE

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.648
ENROLLMENT IN.

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:40.315
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ON YOUR

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.084
AGENDA PROVIDES A PRETTY LENGTHY

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:44.119
ANALYSIS OF OF WHAT HAPPENED

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:45.220
THAT YEAR AND IT'S A SOMEWHAT

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:47.289
COMPLICATED BACKSTORY BUT

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:49.925
EFFECTIVELY WHAT HAPPENED IS THE

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:52.327
STATE SAID IN A MORE PROVIDED

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:54.797
SOME ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING.

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:56.765
AND AN INTENT LANGUAGE STATED

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.300
THAT ONE OF THE PART OF THE

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:00.369
LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS TO GROW

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:01.737
MORE RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATES.

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:02.771

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:04.973
WRENCHED UNDERGRADUATE ALONG AND

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:05.407
BEYOND THAT TARGET.

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:06.642
THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT IN

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.277
PROVIDING THOSE FUNDS THE BUDGET

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:09.978
DIDN'T SET AT THE EXPLICIT

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:13.148
TARGET AND HOW MANY STUDENTS

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:13.515
THAT.

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:14.850
INITIAL TARGET.

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.451
AND IT DIDN'T CLARIFY HOW YOU

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:17.753
SEE WOULD CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:18.854
THAT ENROLLMENT --

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:21.223
AND AND LATER YEARS BECAUSE IT

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.990
WAS ONETIME FUNDING.

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.592
YOU SEE CURRENTLY ESTIMATES THAT

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:25.494
IT AND ROLLED ABOUT NINETEEN

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:26.628
HUNDRED MORE STUDENTS THAN WHAT

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.263
WAS EXPLICITLY BUDGETED AND THE

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.432
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:31.733
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TEN

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.302
MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:35.003
SUPPORT A THOUSAND STUDENTS SO

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.772
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ABOUT.

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:38.207
LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF THE

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:39.875
OVER BUDGET OF THE OVER BUDGET

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:41.009
STUDENTS.

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.011
AND GIVEN THE AMBIGUITIES IN

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:43.846
THIS LANGUAGE WE THINK THE

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:45.414
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ONE

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.882
REASONABLE APPROACH --

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:48.483
BUT ULTIMATELY WITH A QUESTION

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:50.152
FOR THE COMMITTEE IS WHAT DID

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:52.487
THE LEGISLATURE INTEND WHEN IT --

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:54.690
PROVIDED THESE ONE TIME FUNDS.

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:56.091
WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND ISSUE

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.759
ENROLLMENT IN LATER YEARS.

01:14:57.826 --> 01:14:58.927
WHAT IS AN AREA WHERE YOU DON'T

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:00.295
HAVE A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:01.563
GOVERNORS IN PROPOSING?

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:04.733
AN ENROLLMENT TARGET FOR IN

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.334
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY OR EVER

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.101
EVER LATER YEARS.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.135
AND ISN'T OUT ISN'T --

01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:08.437
APPROPRIATING ANY ADDITIONAL

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:10.472
FUNDING ABOVE THAT TEN MILLION

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:12.441
FOR A MOMENT IN.

01:15:12.507 --> 01:15:13.575
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE RECOMMEND

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:14.810
AS WE DO EVERY YEAR THAT YOU

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.078
SAID IN A ROMAN TARGET FOR YOU

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:18.146
SEE AND CLARIFIED THAT INSURES

01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:19.214
THAT YOU SEE IS MEETING YOUR

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:21.516
MOMENT THEIR LEGISLATURES IN

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:23.318
ROMANS EXPECTATIONS. ONE THING

01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:24.786
WE WOULD RECOMMEND IS INSTEAD OF

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.588
SITTING AT FOR TWENTY NINETEEN

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:27.256
TWENTY WE RECOMMEND YOU SET THAT

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:29.391
TARGET.

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:30.025
FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:31.026
THE REASONING FOR THAT IS THAT

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:32.461
BY THE TIME THE LEGISLATURE NEXT

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:33.528
THE BUDGET YOU SEE WILL HAVE

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:35.764
MADE ITS ADMISSION DECISIONS.

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:37.032
FOR FALL TWENTY NINETEEN SETTLED

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:38.033
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LATE TO

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.201
INFLUENCE THEIR DECISIONS OF THE

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.603
LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:42.204
TO SET ITS PRIORITIES FOR THE

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:44.439
FOR THE BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE AND

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:47.042
AS IN PREVIOUS BUDGET FOR THAT

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:50.012
AND IN PREVIOUS BUDGETS.

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:52.014
AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WELL IF

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.348
FOR THAT TARGET BE GROWTH.

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:55.317
MARINE FLAT WHAT WHAT SHOULD

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.052
THAT TARGET THE AND WE OFFER

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.387
SOME FACTORS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER

01:15:58.453 --> 01:15:59.488
A MEASURE AS YOU'RE THINKING

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:00.455
ABOUT THIS AND WEIGHING THIS

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:01.056
AGAINST.

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:02.557
YOUR OTHER BUDGET PRIORITIES FOR

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:03.725
THE SYSTEM.

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:06.328
ON THE ONE HAND THE UNIVERSITY.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.763
IS -- IN A

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:09.164
DRAWING FROM IT LIKELY DRAWING

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:10.933
FROM BEYOND ITS FRESHMAN

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:11.867
ELIGIBILITY.

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.568
FOR AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.537
ARE PROJECTED TO DECLINE SO MUCH

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:16.872
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS NOT THAT

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:17.940
MIGHT SUGGEST THAT THAT THIS

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.374
MIGHT BE A LOWER PRIORITY FOR

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:20.776
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.811
ON THE OTHER HAND MANY ELIGIBLE

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:24.446
STUDENTS ARE NOT ACCOMMODATED TO

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:25.948
THEIR CAMPUS OF CHOICE AND ARE

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.215
REDIRECTED TO MERCED AND AND

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:28.984
MOST STUDENTS ARE RE REFERRED TO

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:30.352
MERCED ON DON'T TAKE UP THE

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.454
ADDITION OFFER DON'T ENROLL IN

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:33.455
THE SYSTEM.

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:34.990
AND SO THAT MIGHT SUGGEST THAT

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:36.591
IT COULD STILL BE A HIGH

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.994
PRIORITY FOR THE COMMITTEE.

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:40.095
AND WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:40.996
ISSUE THE THIRD ISSUE

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.965
NONRESIDENT ROMANCE JUST A NOTE

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:43.765

TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ON THE

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:52.607
ONE AREA OF UNCERTAINTY HERE IS

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.142
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS.

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:55.344

HUNDRED STUDENTS MIGHT NOT.

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.025
IN THAT GROWTH MIGHT NOT IT

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.093
HAPPENED IN NINETEEN TWENTY

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.227
DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:13.762
LEGISLATURE --

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.330
INTENDS FOR USING A KERRY FOR

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:15.797
KERRY OUT OF THAT PLAN

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:16.098

RIGHT IT THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:31.747
ANTICIPATING --

NINETEEN HUNDRED THAT'S A GREAT

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.000
QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

AND THE UNIVERSITY.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.771

WAS.

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:05.981
THE TARGET THAT IS IT SET FOR

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:06.748
ITSELF.

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.450
THERE ARE OTHER MULTIPLE REVENUE

SO WE DECIDED TO FIND THE THE

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:16.224
TARGET.

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:18.293
IS WHAT WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.197

OUR ENROLLMENT FUNDING REQUESTS

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:30.772
THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL --

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.707
AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS.

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:33.809
WE ARE SEEKING TO GROW

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.177

AND BY A THOUSAND NEW GRADUATE

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:44.786
STUDENTS AND THIS WOULD COST A

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.188
TOTAL OF FORTY POINT THREE

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.422

STUDENTS FOR WHICH THERE IS NO

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.304
STATE MARGINAL COST OF

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:03.872
INSTRUCTION RESEARCH RECEIVED

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:06.341
CURRENTLY --

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.910
SO IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE

WAS FUNDING IDENTIFIED FOR TWO

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:18.653
THOUSAND OF FIVE MILLION WHICH

AND THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:26.394
NINETEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS WHO

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:27.496
ARRIVED --

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:29.798
SOME OF THE REASONS WE ENDED UP

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:31.433
OVER AND ROLLING IS THAT --

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.002
ADMISSIONS IS VERY MUCH OF AN

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:36.104
ART MORE THAN NECESSARILY A

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.073
SCIENCE THIS IS LESS THAN A

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.608
PERCENTAGE POINT OFF.

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:41.576
WILL CREATE THIS KIND OF A LARGE

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.078
SWING --

01:19:43.145 --> 01:19:44.746

HAD EXCELLED --

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.324
AND THOSE STUDENTS TOOK UP THOSE

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.126
OFFERS IN FAR GREATER NUMBERS

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:00.028

TO ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED WORDS LA

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.065

THE FIRST PUBLIC AND I CREATED A

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:18.246
LITTLE --

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.114
ADDITIONAL BUMP FOR THEM

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:19.414
[inaudible]

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:42.230
ABOUT.

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:44.265
HOW DO THEY HOW DO HOW DO THEY

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:48.002
PERCEIVE IT THAT THAT --

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:50.038
AND WHAT WHAT CONTRIBUTION TO

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:51.940
MAKE TO THE CAMPUS --

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:53.474
AND ALSO WE'VE LEARNED A LOT

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:54.909
ABOUT WHERE TO ADVERTISE FOR

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:56.678

CANDIDATES FOR FACULTY POSITIONS

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:01.683
SO.

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:02.083
WHERE --

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.751
WE'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS AND

01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:05.987
WE HOPE TO CONTINUE ON THAT.

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:07.589
ON SLIDE.

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:08.256
SEVENTEEN THE NEXT SLIDE UP INTO

CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ROMAN SO FAR

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:12.860
I KNOW THAT --

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:14.262
THE LEGISLATURE'S VERY CONCERNED

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:16.064
ABOUT THAT --

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.665
BUT ARE YOU CEASE.

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:19.233
ENROLLMENT OF NON RESIDENTS HAS

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.602
ALSO BEEN GROWING IN RECENT

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:21.536
YEARS.

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:24.772
IN THIS CHART ON FLIGHT

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:26.474
SEVENTEEN YOU WILL SEE THAT ARE --

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:27.875
HOW THE NON RESIDENTS

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:29.777
REPRESENTED BY DARK YELLOW BAR

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:30.878
HAVE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:32.313
LAST DECADE?

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.514
THE NON RESIDENT ROMAN HAS

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.350
BECOME A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:36.851
CORE FUND REVENUES FOR THE

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:38.152

OF THE PRESENTATION THAT I

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:42.190
STAYED AT THAT NON RESIDENT

01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:44.192
TUITION IS NOW OF ONE POINT

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:45.860
THREE BILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUES

FOR THE UNIVERSITY THAT'S BEING

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:49.030
PAID BY THOSE THAT YELLOW BAR

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:49.631

OF THE REGIONS ON MARCH

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:53.034
FOURTEENTH DECIDED TO DELAY A

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:54.435
VOTE TO INCREASE NONRESIDENTS

SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION BY TWO

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:57.772
POINT 6%.

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:58.906
OF THAT INCREASE WOULD HAVE

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:00.141
YIELDED --

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.876
ANOTHER ALMOST TWENTY NINE

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.111
MILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE THAT

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:04.946
THE UNIVERSITY BUT THE VOTE HAS

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.314
BEEN DELAYED.

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:09.851
ON THAT --

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:12.954
AN ON SLIDE.

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:13.554
EIGHTEEN I WANTED TO SHOW YOU

THE FOUR FUNDS OF THE UNIVERSITY.

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:18.092
OVER THE LAST --

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.394
TWO DECADES.

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:20.862
OR WE'VE MOVING AWAY FROM NON

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:23.564
RESIN -- WE

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.533
CAN TALK ABOUT NON REST I WAS

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.467
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CORE

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:28.036
FUNDS FOR STUDENT NUMBER HOW WE

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:29.203
WOULD SPEND THE ENROLLMENT MONEY

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:30.571
THAT WE'RE REQUESTING.

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:31.606
WELL I HAVE A COUPLE MAY ASK A

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:34.275
QUESTION YES OF COURSE SO I

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:36.611
NOTICED THAT --

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:38.246
THE APPARENTLY A COUPLE OF THE

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:40.548
CAMPUSES EXCEEDED THEIR CAP ON

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:41.849
NON RESIDENT [inaudible]

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:44.385
ESTIMATION.

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:46.521
I I HAVE A GENERAL CONCERN AND

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:48.523
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY --

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:50.558
RESTRICTED TO THE UC CAMPUS IT

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.759
HAPPENS TO BE IN THE SENATE

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:52.927
DISTRICT I'M PRIVILEGED TO

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:55.897
REPRESENT ITS ITS ITS ITS OTHER

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:57.298
UC CAMPUSES AS WELL.

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:58.399
THAT ARE NOT AS ATTRACTIVE

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.902
APPARENTLY TO THE NON RESIDENT

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:03.805
STUDENT AS SOME OF THE MORE --

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:05.306
SOME CAMPUSES COULD IF YOU

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:06.607
WOULDN'T HAVE A CAP COULD

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:08.643
PROBABLY FLOAT TO NON RESIDENT

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:11.079
STUDENT POPULATION MUCH HIGHER

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:12.613
THAN THE CAP I WOULD ASSUME.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.182
I BELIEVE SO --

01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:16.718
AND WHAT THAT DOES WHEN WE HAVE --

01:29:16.784 --> 01:29:18.686
RESIDENT TUITION SORT OF LEVEL

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:20.455
OR FLAT.

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:23.658
IT'LL ALLOW SOME CAMPUSES --

01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:25.660
TO TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT.

01:29:25.727 --> 01:29:27.462
ON CAMPUS REVENUES THROUGH NON

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:29.831
RESIDENT TUITION AND IF WE HAVE

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:31.132
WON THE NON RESIDENT TUITION

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.934
INCREASE.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.303
HOW DO YOU HOW HOW CAN WE DESIGN

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:38.473
A PLAN TO SORT OF SPREAD THAT?

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:39.807
EXTRA MONEY.

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:42.176
ACROSS ALL OF THE UC CAMPUSES

01:29:42.243 --> 01:29:43.945
THOSE THAT HAVE NO TROUBLE

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:46.080
ATTRACTING NONRESIDENT STUDENTS

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:47.682
AND THOSE THAT HAVE TROUBLE.

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:49.650
ATTRACTING NONRESIDENT STUDENTS

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:52.386
SO THAT WE BOATS FLOAT TO THE

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.722
SAME LEVEL.

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:57.425
ANY CHANGE IN THE FUNDING

01:29:57.492 --> 01:29:59.761
DISTRIBUTION FORMULA WOULD HAVE

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:01.963
TO GO TO BE APPROVED BY THE

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:04.132
REGENTS --

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:06.267
CURRENTLY THERE IS NO PROPOSED

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:09.270
CHANGE TO OUR OF FORMULA IN

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:10.171
FRONT OF THE REGIONS.

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.340
OF THE CAMPUS THAT IN ROLES TO

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:14.075
STUDENT GETS TO KEEP THE REVENUE

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:16.010
FROM THAT STUDENT --

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.879
PARTLY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:19.614
SERVICES THAT STUDENT AND IN

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.482
ORDER TO GROW SERVICES FOR THE

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:22.950
RESIDENT STUDENTS THROUGH THE

01:30:23.017 --> 01:30:25.253
EXTRA REVENUE THAT THEY GOT FROM

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:27.755
THOSE NON RESIDENTS --

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:29.457
I I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SIR

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:31.259
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE US TO

01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:33.294
CONSIDER SOME KIND OF A

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:34.529
DIFFERENTIAL REVENUE SHARE WITH

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.297
JUST IT IT CREATES OF CERTAIN

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:38.166
INEQUITY IN THE IN THE IN THE

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:39.667
SYSTEM AND I REALIZE YOU KNOW

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:40.735
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL.

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:42.537
SEPARATIONS AND ALL THAT BUT IT

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:45.139
DOES CREATE SORT OF IT SEEMS TO

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:46.240
ME AN INEQUITY IN THE SYSTEM.

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:48.075
BUT HAVE CAMPUSES AND THEY HAVE

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:50.678
NOT CAMPUSES AS IT PERTAINS.

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:51.846
TO NON RESIDENT STUDENT TUITION

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:53.047
AND THE COST OF EDUCATING THE

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:54.649
STUDENT.

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:55.616
THE NON RESIDENT STUDENT

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:57.084
PROBABLY IS THE SAME AS THE COST

01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:58.820
OF EDUCATING THE RESIDENT

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:00.087
STUDENT TO THE MOST YES.

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:01.756
AND SO THERE'S A DELTA THERE

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:04.592
THAT IS ABLE TO BE USED BY THE

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:06.961
HAVE CAMPUSES.

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:08.496
THAT THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE THAT.

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:10.865
DO WITHOUT AND AND WHAT PIQUED

01:31:10.932 --> 01:31:12.333
MY CURIOSITY WAS MY

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.769
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLAN.

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:16.437
TO DEAL WITH THE NET REVENUE

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:18.072
GENERATED BY --

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.007
THE OVER AND ROLL BUT OF NON

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:22.043
RESIDENT STUDENTS ABOVE THE

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:23.511
CAPTAIN IS MY UNDERSTANDING.

01:31:23.578 --> 01:31:24.979
THAT THAT'S GOING TO SORT OF BE

01:31:25.046 --> 01:31:26.881
DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE THROUGH

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:28.850
THE SYSTEM THAT'S CORRECT SIR

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:31.018
AND AND I WAS WHEN I READ THAT I

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:32.420
THOUGHT WELL WHAT WHY IS THAT

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:34.121
MONEY.

01:31:34.188 --> 01:31:36.490
IF IF NOTHING ELSE NOT BEING

01:31:36.557 --> 01:31:38.726
DISTRIBUTED TO THE CAMPUSES THAT

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.094
DON'T HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.496
RECRUITING AND RETAINING NON.

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:45.333
STUDENTS IF FOR NO OTHER REASON

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:47.702
THAN -- TO

01:31:47.768 --> 01:31:49.437
THIS INCENTIVIZE.

01:31:49.503 --> 01:31:51.572
THIS NON RESIDENT OF STUDENT

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:55.610
ENROLLMENT IF THAT'S THE GOAL --

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:56.944
HERE YOU SAY CORRECTLY THAT YOU

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:58.546
WOULD PREFER THE OVER ENROLLMENT

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:00.214
FUNDING FROM THOSE NON RESIDENTS

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.983
BE GIVEN TO THE CAMPUSES TO MAKE

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:04.852
CERTAIN OF ONE TWO CAMPUSES THAT

01:32:04.919 --> 01:32:06.187
DID NOT OVER AND ROLL ONLY.

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:07.555
RIGHT OR THE OKAY OKAY OR THOSE

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:10.091
CAMPUSES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE

01:32:10.157 --> 01:32:11.225
ABILITY.

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:13.027
TO OF SECURE VERY MANY NON

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:14.295
RESIDENT STUDENTS IN THERE BY

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.931
GENERATE THE ADDITIONAL

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:19.066
OPERATING REVENUES AT SOME

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.035
CAMPUSES A RIPPLE TO GENERATE.

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:22.637
OF WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:23.571
AND I MEAN I DON'T HAVE.

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:25.339
MY SAY RIGHT I MEAN I UNDERSTAND

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:26.574
THAT BUT I'M JUST I WAS

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:28.643
EXPRESSING CONCERN WITH THE WAY

01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:30.077
THE NON RESIDENT TUITION.

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.979
SYSTEM WORKS ACROSS YOU SEE

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.848
BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE'S MORE

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:35.750
THAN.

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:36.751
ONE UC CAMPUS.

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:37.818
THAT HAS TROUBLE ATTRACTING

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:39.687
NONRESIDENT STUDENTS --

01:32:39.754 --> 01:32:42.023
YES YES WE HAVE WE HAVE A FEW OF

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:43.124
THOSE AND THEN THERE'S SOME ON

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:44.859
THE COAST OF PROBABLY HAVE NO

01:32:44.926 --> 01:32:46.594
TROUBLE ATTRACTING NON RESIDENT

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.129
STUDENTS THAT'S CORRECT AND THEN

01:32:48.195 --> 01:32:49.897
IT SORT OF CREATES AN INEQUITY

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:51.933
IN THE WAY THE THE REVENUE

01:32:51.999 --> 01:32:54.302
SYSTEM WORKS AMONG UC CAMPUSES

01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:54.769
AND I I'M.

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:58.372
I'M JUST HOPEFUL WOULD YOU ALL

01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:01.108
THERE'S A MORE EQUITABLE WAY TO

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:03.811
AT LEAST --

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:04.979
DISTRIBUTE SOME OF THE FUNDS --

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:06.614
HOW ABOVE THE LEVEL NECESSARY TO

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:08.215
EDUCATE?

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:11.018
STUDENTS IN THE UC SYSTEM.

01:33:11.085 --> 01:33:13.321
SIR I WILL TAKE YOUR PERSPECTIVE

01:33:13.387 --> 01:33:15.022
BACK TO OUR LEADERSHIP THAT'S

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:16.257
ALWAYS WHAT IS THAT I I DIDN'T

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:17.591
MEAN TO BELABOR THE POINT I

01:33:17.658 --> 01:33:19.293
THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERESTING

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.962
READ THOUGH SO I WANT TO ASK BUT

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:21.862
PLEASE PROCEED.

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.230
ALL RIGHT --

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:26.100
SO ON SLIDE EIGHTEEN I HAVE SOME

01:33:26.167 --> 01:33:27.368
INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE ARE WE

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:28.903
IN TERMS OF OUR FUNDING FOR

01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:30.638
STUDENTS SYSTEM WIDE FOR THIS IS

01:33:30.705 --> 01:33:32.206
LOOKING SYSTEM WIDE.

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:33.574
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU SEE

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:37.311
OUR TOTAL FUNDS OF FROM

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:39.480
200-022-00018 AND YOU'LL SEE

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:40.047
THAT.

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:43.784
OF IN ACTUAL DOLLARS OUR CORE

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:45.753
FUNDS HAVE BEEN INCREASING A LOT

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.787
OF THIS IS BECAUSE THE

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:48.789
LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS HAS

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.658
BEEN PROVIDING YOU SEE WITH MORE

01:33:50.725 --> 01:33:52.393
FUNDING CONSISTENTLY ESTY

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.894
ECONOMY IMPROVED.

01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:55.596
THE LEGISLATURE WAS PROVIDING

01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:59.266
YOU SEE WITH FUNDING AND WE VERY

01:33:59.333 --> 01:33:59.734
MUCH APPRECIATE THAT.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.869
BUT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:34:01.936 --> 01:34:02.470
TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON THE MIDDLE

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:03.304
CHART THERE.

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:04.705
YOU WILL SEE THAT OUR STUDENT

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:07.041
ENROLLMENT AS A WHOLE INCREASED

01:34:07.108 --> 01:34:10.077
BY 59% OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:11.812
YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TAKING ON A

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.447
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STUDENTS.

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:14.715
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT

01:34:14.782 --> 01:34:16.617
OF INCREASED ENROLLMENT AND THE

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:18.786
DOLLARS THE DOLLARS AVAILABLE

01:34:18.853 --> 01:34:20.821
PER STUDENT SYSTEM WHITE OUR

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:23.124
CAMPUSES HAS ACTUALLY DECREASED

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:24.091
BY.

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:26.594
31% PER STUDENT IS IS IS THERE A

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.562
IS THERE A PROBLEM.

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:29.930
BECAUSE WE READ IN THE BUDGET

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:31.532
YOU KNOW GOING TO ENROLL TWO

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:32.600
THOUSAND WERE YOU DOING.

01:34:32.666 --> 01:34:35.069
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU WHATEVER IT

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:38.439
IS TWENTY HELLO WE USE.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:41.342
IN DOING OUR BUDGETING.

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:43.077
A NO WE AGREE WITH THE MARGINAL

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:44.512
COST OF INSTRUCTION THAT.

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:47.048
WE USE CURRENTLY --

01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:48.582
IT'S JUST THAT.

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:50.551
THE STATE FUNDS HAVEN'T KEPT UP

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:53.220
FULLY WITH THE ENROLLMENT AND WE

01:34:53.287 --> 01:34:54.488
WE NEED WE NEED ADDITIONAL

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:56.257
FUNDING.

01:34:56.323 --> 01:34:57.925
OKAY I'LL GO TO SCHOOL ON THAT

01:34:57.992 --> 01:34:59.593
SO NEXT TIME I'LL BE SMARTER.

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.962
SO THE MARGIN WE WE BUDGET TO

01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:03.330
THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION.

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:04.598
HELP ME FINANCE THAT THAT'S

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:05.933
CORRECT YEAH BUT IT'S EARLY IN

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.469
THE PAST WE'VE GIVEN MORE.

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:09.770
WELL HOW DO WE DO THAT WE GET IF

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:10.838
WE BROUGHT BUDGETING TO THE

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:12.206
MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION HOW

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:15.843
DO WE HAVE A 31% DECREASE.

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:17.211
THIRTY ONE ARE A LOT OF THAT HAD

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:18.345
TO DO WITH THE ONE BILLION

01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:20.548
DOLLAR CUT THE UNIVERSITY TOOK

01:35:20.614 --> 01:35:22.483
IN THE GREAT RECESSION.

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.118
WE WERE WE WERE CUT FROM THREE

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:25.753
BILLION TO TWO BILLION AND WHILE

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.721
YOU'VE BEEN BUILDING OUR BUDGET

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:29.457
UP I SEE IN HER ROOM AND WE IN

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:31.492
ROMAN GROUP AND WE HAVEN'T

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:32.159
REALLY IT RESTORED.

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:33.727
IN PROPORTION THE MONEY THAT WE

01:35:33.794 --> 01:35:36.197
TOOK FROM YOU THAT'S CORRECT SIR

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:39.934
I GET IT TAKES ME AWHILE.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.368
OF THANKS FINE IT'S I THINK I

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:42.736

01:35:42.803 --> 01:35:44.705
YOU'RE DEAD YOU GOT IT THANK YOU

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:46.507
SIR -- ON

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:47.975
THE NEXT SLIDE I WANTED TO TALK

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:49.610
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:52.012
THE IMPACT OF THIS DECREASE IN

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.114
31%.

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.582
QUALITY FOR STUDENTS.

01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:56.617
EARTH THE IMPACT ON QUALITY OF

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:59.553
THIS 31% DECREASE IN FUNDING FOR

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.588
STUDENT.

01:36:00.654 --> 01:36:02.256
AND YOU'LL SEE THERE THAT YOU

01:36:02.323 --> 01:36:04.358
CEASE STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.627
HAS BEEN INCREASING STEADILY

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:07.328
OVER THE LAST.

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:08.963
OUR SINS ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS

01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:11.732
BUT EXPRESSLY AND WE'VE BEEN

01:36:11.799 --> 01:36:13.601
GOING UP A LITTLE BIT --

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:15.469
OUR COMPARISON PUBLIC AND

01:36:15.536 --> 01:36:17.071
PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ARE WAY

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:18.239
BELOW US.

01:36:18.305 --> 01:36:19.974
SO EVEN THOUGH OUR COMPARISON

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.142
PUBLIC THEY'VE PAID THEIR

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:24.245
FACULTY ALONG A LITTLE BIT LESS.

01:36:24.311 --> 01:36:25.012
THERE ARE --

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:25.946
THERE.

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:27.348
THEY HAVE A LOT MORE STATE

01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:30.351
FUNDING AND PLACES LIKE MICHIGAN

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:32.153
QUITE FRANKLY HAVE 40% NON

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:33.721
RESIDENT EMPLOYMENT SO THEY HAVE

01:36:33.787 --> 01:36:34.588
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REVENUE

01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:36.090
COMING INTO THOSE KINDS OF

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:37.525
SOURCES --

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:39.059
AND THEY ARE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:43.364
STUDENT FACULTY RATIOS LOWER --

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:45.232
AND FLIGHT TWENTY IS WHERE I

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:46.066
REALLY WANT TO DRAW YOUR

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:47.735
ATTENTION BUT IS IS VERY FROM

01:36:47.801 --> 01:36:49.470
CAMPUS TO CAMPUS OR IS IT

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:50.871
GENERALLY.

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:52.773
THE SAME ACROSS CAMPUS IT VARIES

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.241
FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS THESE ARE

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:56.043
SYSTEM WIDE AVERAGES AND IT ALSO

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:57.611
VARIES WITH IN.

01:36:57.678 --> 01:37:00.714
DISCIPLINES ON CAMPUSES SO BACK

01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:02.316
TO THE NON RESIDENT TUITION

01:37:02.383 --> 01:37:04.185
CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD.

01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:05.319
THOSE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE

01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:07.154
SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:08.856
COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING NON

01:37:08.923 --> 01:37:10.558
RESIDENT STUDENTS WHO PAY NON

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:12.159
RESIDENT TUITION.

01:37:12.226 --> 01:37:13.661
WHAT I IF I WERE?

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:15.362
TO DO A DEEP DIVE WHAT I FIND

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:18.599
THAT THEIR STUDENT TO FACULTY

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:19.733
RATIO IS IS LOWER.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.602
THE LET'S SAY.

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:24.071
I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT THOSE

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:24.838
NUMBERS LET ME BRING THEM TO

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:25.739
YOUR OFFICE.

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:28.909
YES IF I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE.

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:30.644
BUT YOU MAY BE CORRECT ON THAT --

01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:32.346
SLIDE.

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.348
TWENTY OF OUR OVERALL STUDENT

01:37:34.415 --> 01:37:36.417
SATISFACTION AT UC AND THIS IS

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:38.152
REALLY THESE NUMBERS HERE ON

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:39.787
SLIDE TWENTY ARE ASED ON A

01:37:39.853 --> 01:37:40.921
SURVEY THAT WE DO OF OUR

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:43.090
UNDERGRADUATE EVERY TWO YEARS

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:44.058
WHERE WE ASK THEM HOWARE YOU

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:45.125
LIKING THE SEE.

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:46.794
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:47.494
EXPERIENCE HERE.

01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:50.297
AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX UNDER

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:51.966
RIGHT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.234
THERE --

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.802
STUDENTS WERE UP ASKED KNOWING

01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:56.136
WHAT I KNOW NOW WHAT I STILL

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:58.739
CHOOSE TO ENROLL AT MY UC CAMPUS.

01:37:58.806 --> 01:37:59.640
AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THIRTY

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:03.010
THREE PER ONLY YES ABSOLUTELY I

01:38:03.077 --> 01:38:04.812
WOULD COME AGAIN.

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:07.514
OF BY TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT A

01:38:07.581 --> 01:38:08.716
STRONG 218%.

01:38:08.782 --> 01:38:10.651
SAID STRONGLY YES.

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.886
SO THERE'S THERE'S A TREND

01:38:12.953 --> 01:38:14.221
OCCURRING THERE WERE STUDENTS

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:17.091
ARE BECOMING LESS SATISFIED.

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:19.660
WITH WHAT THEY'RE RECEIVING A QC.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:20.761
BUT PERHAPS SOME OF THE MOST

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:23.163
DISTURBING DATA IS THERE ON THE

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:24.798
RIGHT HAND SIDE.

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:27.568
THAT IN THE LAST DECADE FROM

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:29.737
200-062-2016 STUDENTS WHO COULD

01:38:29.803 --> 01:38:32.006
NOT GET INTO THEIR FIRST MAJOR.

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:35.476
INCREASE FROM 3% 213%.

01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:37.511
THE 13% OF OUR INCOMING FRESHMAN

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:39.346
CLASS CAN'T GET INTO THE MAJOR

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:40.381
THAT THEY WANT TO GET INTO

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:41.915
BECAUSE THEY'RE IMPACTED.

01:38:41.982 --> 01:38:43.550
BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH

01:38:43.617 --> 01:38:45.452
FACULTY TEACHING THEM.

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:46.887
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THERE'S A

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:48.355
TREMENDOUS LOSS OF HUMAN

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:50.291
POTENTIAL STUDENTS CAN STUDY THE

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:51.759
THING THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:53.961
PASSIONATE OR INTERESTED IN --

01:38:54.028 --> 01:38:56.230
AND ALSO THERE'S A SENSE OF

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:57.765
DISAPPOINTMENT IN A DAY MAYBE

01:38:57.831 --> 01:38:59.433
KICK START FEELING LOST MAYBE

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.934
THEY DON'T KNOW.

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:01.969
WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH OUR

01:39:02.036 --> 01:39:03.103
LIVES TO TO MAKE THE RIGHT

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:04.338
CHOICE LOOKS AT HER?

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:05.639
SO WHAT'S THE GATE THERE IS THE

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:06.807
GATE THE FIRST THE ENTRY LEVEL

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:09.043
COURSE INTO A PARTICULAR MAJORS

01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:10.844
HAVE POLITICAL SCIENCE ONE A ONE

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:12.012
AND THEY CAN'T GET INTO THAT.

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.380
AND IF THE CASTING CAN'T GET

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:16.483
INTO THAT THEN THEY CAN'T BE A

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:17.584
POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR.

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:18.252
ALRIGHT YOU TOTAL THE NUMBER OF

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:19.386
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE A

01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:21.055
POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR AND YOU

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:23.023
KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:24.725
FOR TWENTY FIVE MORE AND SO IF

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:26.860
FIFTY SHOW UP AT THE FRONT GATE.

01:39:26.927 --> 01:39:29.496
TWENTY FIVE GET IN AND TWENTY

01:39:29.563 --> 01:39:30.998
FIVE LADDER THAT FIFTY SHOW UP

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:32.266
IN TWENTY FIVE DON'T GET IT YEAH

01:39:32.333 --> 01:39:33.867
BECAUSE YOU COUNT THE NUMBER OF

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:35.869
PEOPLE WHO DECLARE POLITICAL

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:37.438
SCIENCE MAJOR IN YOU KNOW.

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:38.972
BUT YOU CAN ONLY HANDLE A

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:40.007
THOUSAND OF THEM THAT'S CORRECT

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.775
OKAY YEAH I DID NOT KNOW THAT'S

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:43.610
INTERESTING --

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:45.646

01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:47.281
OUR STUDENTS ARE FEELING LESS

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:48.949

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:51.251
THERE'S BEEN A 14% OF DROP.

01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:52.753
IN STUDENTS WHO SAY THEY KNOW

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:55.055
THEIR FACULTY WELL ENOUGH TO ASK

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:56.523

WHEN OUR FRESHMEN COME INTO UC

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:01.061
39% OF THEM SAY THEY WANT TO GO

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:02.629

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:20.347
THAT'S A REQUIREMENT WHY IS THAT

01:40:20.414 --> 01:40:22.216

TEACHING STUDENTS.

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:32.726
IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.695
FACULTY MY FATHER WAS A

01:45:34.761 --> 01:45:38.765
PROFESSOR AND HE DID NOT ENJOY

01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:40.233

PROFESSOR AND HE SPECIFICALLY

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:45.172
REQUEST TO TEACH UNDERGRADUATES

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:46.840
BECAUSE HE ENJOYS THEM SO.

01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:48.041
IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL

01:45:48.108 --> 01:45:50.410
FASCINATING ISSUE MAYBE THE BIOS

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:51.611
SHOULD BE INCREASED SO WE CAN

01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:53.680
HER TENURE TRACK FACULTY INSTEAD

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:55.182
OF LECTURES AND MAYBE THAT WOULD

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:57.250
HELP SOLVE THE STUDENTS

01:45:57.317 --> 01:45:58.552
SATISFACTION.

01:45:58.618 --> 01:46:01.054
I'M I'M NOT A 100% CERTAIN ON

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:03.090
THAT BECAUSE THE IT COMES OUT OF

01:46:03.156 --> 01:46:03.924
THE GRANT AND IT'S ALSO

01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:05.392
DEPENDENT ON THE GRANT A

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:06.760
PROVIDER.

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:09.329
WHAT THEY ALLOW AS PART OF THEIR

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:09.963
GRANTS?

01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:11.598
THE AT I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:13.166
WHAT MOST OF OUR GRANTS COME

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:14.534
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:15.569
SO I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT

01:46:15.635 --> 01:46:16.803
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PERMITS

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:18.305
ON THAT GRANT YOUR TERM LIMITED

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:20.674
AND SO AND SO WERE LECTURES.

01:46:20.741 --> 01:46:22.209
YES THE TENURE TRACK FACULTY OR

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:23.810
NOT SO THAT PROBABLY IS THE

01:46:23.877 --> 01:46:25.445
ANSWER BUT IT MAY ALSO CREATE

01:46:25.512 --> 01:46:27.214
THE PROBLEM INTERESTING I DON'T

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.181

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET --

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:19.332

WE ARE HEARTENED BY THE FACT

01:47:28.074 --> 01:47:29.109
THAT PRESIDENT OF METROPOLIS

01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:30.677
HONDA HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THAT

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:32.279
WILL BE THE CASE --

01:47:32.345 --> 01:47:33.113
WE LOOK FORWARD TO A

01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:34.648
CONVERSATION ON HOW WE CAN

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:36.016
COLLABORATE ON SHORT AND LONG

01:47:36.082 --> 01:47:37.184
TERM INITIATIVES WITH EASY TO

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:38.618
PROVIDE FISCAL CERTAINTY FOR

01:47:38.685 --> 01:47:39.853
STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.521
INCREASE ACCESS IMPROVED IN

01:47:41.588 --> 01:47:44.424
SUCCESS CREATE A MORE COST

01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:44.958
EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF HIGHER

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:45.592
EDUCATION.

01:47:45.659 --> 01:47:46.593
AND PROBABLY BETWEEN HIGHER

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.028
EDUCATION SKILLS NEEDED FOR THE

01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:49.563
ECONOMY NOW AND IN THE FUTURE

01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:51.431
THANKS THANK YOU THANKS FOR YOUR

01:47:51.498 --> 01:47:53.767
SUPPORT HELLO.

01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:55.669
SO THERE ARE THREE ISSUES HERE

01:47:55.735 --> 01:47:56.736
IN THIS ITEM --

01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:58.138
THE FIRST PERTAINS TO RESIDENT

01:47:58.205 --> 01:47:59.673
TUITION AND FEES THE SECOND

01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:01.141
PERTAINS TO NON RESIDENT TUITION

01:48:01.208 --> 01:48:02.175
AND FEES.

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:03.410
AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE IS

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:03.944
SOMETHING THAT THE

01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:04.644
ADMINISTRATION HAS RAISED

01:48:04.711 --> 01:48:07.013
REGARDING IMPROVING FISCAL

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.149
STABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:09.916
STUDENTS AND THEIR AND THEIR

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:10.684
HOUSEHOLDS.

01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:11.852
SOLDIERS EACH ISSUE.

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:15.722
REGARDING RED OUR ANALYSIS --

01:48:15.789 --> 01:48:17.023
AT THE TIME THERE WERE STILL

01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:18.158
SOME DISCUSSION MOTHER NOT

01:48:18.225 --> 01:48:18.992
THERE'D BE A TUITION INCREASE

01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:20.493
YOU SEE HAS ANNOUNCED THEY WILL

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:21.928
NOT INCREASE TUITION.

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:23.163
NONE THE LESS I THOUGHT IT MIGHT

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:24.231
BE INTERESTING TO DIRECT YOUR

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:25.966
ATTENTION TO PAGE SIXTEEN YOUR

01:48:26.032 --> 01:48:27.133
AGENDA.

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.902
WITH WHICH IS A IS A OF THE

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:30.937
FIGURE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER IT

01:48:31.004 --> 01:48:32.572
ESTIMATES.

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:34.307
I TRIED TO ESTIMATE THE HOW MUCH

01:48:34.374 --> 01:48:35.742
OF THE HOW MUCH CORE FUNDING IS

01:48:35.809 --> 01:48:37.377
SHARED BETWEEN.

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:39.079
OF THE STATE HOW MUCH THE BY

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:42.249
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND THEIR

01:48:42.315 --> 01:48:43.750
SHARED BY NON RESIDENT STUDENTS.

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:45.018
AND THE REASON WHY WE WE THINK

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:46.653
THE FIGURES ROLLED RELEVANT IS

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.389
BECAUSE AS THE LEGISLATURES ARE

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:49.990
WAYS TO WHICH INCREASES EVERY

01:48:50.056 --> 01:48:51.191
YEAR.

01:48:51.258 --> 01:48:52.525
REALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

01:48:52.592 --> 01:48:54.227
IS HOW DOES THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:54.294 --> 01:48:55.695
WANTED YOUR COST INCREASES EACH

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:57.330
YEAR BETWEEN THE STATE.

01:48:57.397 --> 01:48:58.865
BETWEEN STUDENTS AND ALSO

01:48:58.932 --> 01:49:01.534
INCREASINGLY BETWEEN NON

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:02.502
RESIDENT STUDENTS.

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:03.069
I'M IN YEARS WHERE THE STATE

01:49:03.136 --> 01:49:03.703
DOESN'T INCREASE TUITION

01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:05.538
EFFECTIVELY THAT INCREASES THE

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:06.773
STATE FAIR TO COVER COSTS IS THE

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.341
STATE'S COVERING THE COST

01:49:08.408 --> 01:49:10.010
INCREASES IN THAT YEAR --

01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:10.744
IN YEARS WHERE THERE'S NOT

01:49:10.810 --> 01:49:12.145
REALLY A RATHER IS A TUITION

01:49:12.212 --> 01:49:13.446
HIKE THAT INCREASES THE STUDENTS

01:49:13.513 --> 01:49:14.481
SHARE AND YOURS WERE THEY

01:49:14.547 --> 01:49:16.016
INCREASE ROUGHLY PROPORTIONATE

01:49:16.082 --> 01:49:17.384
THAT KIND OF KEEP THAT SHARON.

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:18.985
AND ON TRACK AND YOU CAN SEE

01:49:19.052 --> 01:49:21.554
HERE THE STAY FIND A SOMEWHAT

01:49:21.621 --> 01:49:23.156
OVER THE YEARS ESPECIALLY DURING

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:24.224
THE RECESSION WHEN THEY'RE IN

01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:25.825
THEIR BUDGET CUTS ENACTED AND

01:49:25.892 --> 01:49:27.060
YOU SEE --

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:28.161
COVERED SOME OF THAT WITH A

01:49:28.228 --> 01:49:29.329
TUITION INCREASE ON RESIDENT

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:30.664
STUDENTS --

01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:32.365
BUT IT'S STILL MORE THAN A HALF

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:33.967
IF YOU IF YOU FACTOR IN --

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:35.502
FINANCIALLY THAT STATE PROVIDES

01:49:35.568 --> 01:49:36.436
BOTH THROUGH THE CAL GRANT

01:49:36.503 --> 01:49:38.071
PROGRAM AND ALSO THAT TUITION

01:49:38.138 --> 01:49:39.739
AND FEES ARE WAIVED TO STUDENTS

01:49:39.806 --> 01:49:42.842
THREE YOU SEE A AND SO AGAIN THE

01:49:42.909 --> 01:49:43.944
KEY QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:44.344
IS.

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:46.279
IS DOES THIS MAKE SENSE IT'S

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:48.315
IT'S A FEATURE TO LOW TO TO HIRE

01:49:48.381 --> 01:49:49.749
STUDENTS CONTRIBUTING TO MUCH.

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:50.917
OF THAT'S REALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:52.218
QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:54.287
EACH YEAR THAT EVALUATES TUITION

01:49:54.354 --> 01:49:55.455
INCREASES.

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:57.057
REGARDING THE SECOND ISSUE NON

01:49:57.123 --> 01:49:58.892
RESIDENT TUITION I WANTED TO

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:00.627
TOUCH ON THAT OUR ANALYSIS HAD

01:50:00.694 --> 01:50:02.329
HAD RECOMMENDED THAT.

01:50:02.395 --> 01:50:04.898
THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER --

01:50:04.965 --> 01:50:06.266
THE NON RESIDENT TUITION

01:50:06.333 --> 01:50:07.300
INCREASES THAT YOU SEE HAD

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:09.169
PLANNED TO ADOPT AND USE THE

01:50:09.235 --> 01:50:10.804
ASSOCIATED REVENUE TO OFFSET

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.105
GENERAL FUND COSTS.

01:50:12.172 --> 01:50:13.940
OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS RECENTLY

01:50:14.007 --> 01:50:15.942
AND REJECTED A TUITION INCREASE

01:50:16.009 --> 01:50:17.377
SO THAT ASSOCIATED REVENUE

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.478
WOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE TO OFFSET

01:50:18.545 --> 01:50:20.246
COSTS AND LESS OF THE REGIONS.

01:50:20.313 --> 01:50:22.682
AT A LATER TIME DECIDE TO

01:50:22.749 --> 01:50:23.216
INCREASE THAT [inaudible]

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:25.452
TUITION CHARGE.

01:50:25.518 --> 01:50:26.653
AND WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST DAY

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.221
A TIRD ISSUE THAT THE

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:30.357
ADMINISTRATION RAISES. FOR

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:31.958
FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY.

01:50:32.025 --> 01:50:34.160
I WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO

01:50:34.227 --> 01:50:35.862
PAGE. FOURTEEN FOURTEEN IS

01:50:35.929 --> 01:50:37.130
REALLY WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:38.898
IS LOOKING AT WHEN WHEN THAT

01:50:38.965 --> 01:50:40.633
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT FISCAL SEE

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.335
US THE BILLETING.

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:43.803
AS YOU CAN SEE.

01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:45.739
UP IN SOME PERIOD SO THE STATE'S

01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:47.707
HISTORY TUITION HAS BEEN FLAT OR

01:50:47.774 --> 01:50:48.842
EVEN DECLINED.

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:49.609
AND THEIR OTHER YEARS WERE THERE

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:50.877
HAVE BEEN REALLY REALLY NOTABLE

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:52.912
TUITION HIKES THAT'S LARGELY

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:54.047
DRIVEN BY THE STATE OF THE BY

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:55.515
THE STATE BUDGET AND YEARS WERE

01:50:55.582 --> 01:50:56.816
REVENUES ARE STRONG THE STATE

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:58.218
HAS BEEN ABLE TO KEEP TUITION

01:50:58.284 --> 01:50:59.185
FLAT.

01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:00.987
AND YEARS WERE THEIR BUDGET

01:51:01.054 --> 01:51:03.189
REDUCTIONS YOU SEE IS HOW TO

01:51:03.256 --> 01:51:04.190
CREASES AND THAT.

01:51:04.257 --> 01:51:05.759
CREATES SOME UNPREDICTABILITY

01:51:05.825 --> 01:51:06.926
FOR STUDENTS AS THEY'RE GOING

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:07.460
THROUGH THREE YEARS AND IN

01:51:07.527 --> 01:51:09.562
COLLEGE.

01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:10.397
WE THINK THAT THIS IS THAT

01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:11.831
APPROPRIATE --

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:13.099
POLICY ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:51:13.166 --> 01:51:14.534
TO CONSIDER.

01:51:14.601 --> 01:51:16.136
I'M BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS IS

01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:17.937
AFFECTED BY THE STATE BUDGET ONE

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:19.406
KEY WAY TO LEGISLATE WHEN HE

01:51:19.472 --> 01:51:21.007
TOLD THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO

01:51:21.074 --> 01:51:22.442
ENSURE STABILITY IS TO SET ASIDE

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:23.710
FUNDS AND IN THE GENERAL FUND

01:51:23.777 --> 01:51:25.011
RESERVE VERY YEAR.

01:51:25.078 --> 01:51:26.012
SUCH THAT WHEN THERE IS A

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:27.781
RECESSION IT CAN USE THOSE FUNDS.

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:29.249
TO COVER --

01:51:29.315 --> 01:51:31.751
UP A POTENTIAL BUDGET CUTS AND

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:33.753
IF IT IN YEARS WERE REVENUES

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.188
DECLINED.

01:51:35.255 --> 01:51:36.756
ANOTHER UP ENDED IN TANDEM TO

01:51:36.823 --> 01:51:37.657
THAT --

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:39.025
HAVING A CLEAR POLICY ON HOW

01:51:39.092 --> 01:51:41.227
MUCH STUDENTS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:43.363
EACH YEAR TO THEIR OUR COSTS

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:44.464
WOULD ALSO HELP.

01:51:44.531 --> 01:51:45.231
ENSURE THAT THERE'S A CLEAR

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:46.833
POLICY IN A TRANSPARENT POLICY

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.234
GUIDING TUITION INCREASES IN THE

01:51:48.301 --> 01:51:49.302
WAY THAT MY WORK.

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:50.570
AS A LEGISLATURE WOULD DECIDE

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:51.805
WHAT WHAT YEAR OF COST SHOULD

01:51:51.871 --> 01:51:53.006
STUDENTS CONTRIBUTE TO THEY

01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:54.874
CONTRIBUTE 10% SHOULD THEY

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:56.176
CONTRIBUTE 20%.

01:51:56.242 --> 01:51:56.976
AND IT WOULD.

01:51:57.043 --> 01:51:58.311
BE AN OPERATIONAL POLICY THAT

01:51:58.378 --> 01:51:59.446
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WORK

01:51:59.512 --> 01:52:01.247
TOWARDS EVERY YEAR AND WHAT'S

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:02.615
ATTAINING THAT.

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:04.784
PROPORTION IT WOULD THEN SHARE

01:52:04.851 --> 01:52:06.419
CO EQUALLY GENTLE FUN TUITION

01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:07.587
EACH YEAR AND THAT WOULD BE ONE

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:09.456
WAY TO ADD MORE TRANSPARENCY TO

01:52:09.522 --> 01:52:10.890
THE TUITION DISCUSSION WELL

01:52:10.957 --> 01:52:12.592
ISN'T THERE OF ISN'T THERE MEAN

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:13.426
THERE'S THERE'S A CLEAR

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:15.228
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TUITION

TUITION INCREASES IN OUR

BUT THAT WAIVER PROCESS DOES NOT

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:43.403
CAPTURE EVERY UNDOCUMENTED

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:45.738
STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM --

01:55:45.805 --> 01:55:47.373

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:50.043
TENDED A CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL

FOR THREE YEARS I GRADUATED FROM

01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:53.146
A CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL.

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:55.848
IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THAT A.

01:55:55.915 --> 01:55:59.285
B. FIVE FORTY WAIVER --

01:55:59.352 --> 01:56:00.687
WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE CAMPUS

01:56:00.753 --> 01:56:04.891
BASED FEE A CAMPUS BASED FREE IS

01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:05.825
A FEVER --

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:06.926
THAT CAN COME ABOUT IN TWO WAYS

01:56:06.993 --> 01:56:09.195
MOSTLY VOTED IN BY THE STUDENTS

01:56:09.262 --> 01:56:11.264
THEMSELVES.

01:56:11.331 --> 01:56:13.066
THE STUDENTS CAN CHOOSE TO TAX

01:56:13.132 --> 01:56:14.600
THEMSELVES FOR PARTICULAR

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:17.270
PURPOSES THEY CAN DO THIS.

01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:19.172
FOR OF SOME.

01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:19.972
PROGRAMS --

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:24.811
SERVICE PRO THAT THEY DO --

01:56:24.877 --> 01:56:29.949
AND FOR EXAMPLE AS TO UC DAVIS --

01:56:30.016 --> 01:56:34.320
THERE IS A US LET'S SEE THEY DO

01:56:34.387 --> 01:56:36.022
CHARGE THEMSELVES A MEMORIAL

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:37.457
UNION FEE --

01:56:37.523 --> 01:56:39.025
WHICH HELPS PAY FOR PARTICULAR

01:56:39.092 --> 01:56:40.693
BUILDING ON THE CAMPUS --

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:42.895
UPGRADES TO THAT IT'S A STUDENT

01:56:42.962 --> 01:56:44.464
MEETING PLACE WHERE THEY CAN

01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:46.699
STUDY AND HAVE THEIR CLUBS AND

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:47.700
SUCH [inaudible]

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:50.670
SO OF THE CAMPUS BASED FEES ARE

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:52.171
VOTED IN EITHER BY THE STUDENTS

01:56:52.238 --> 01:56:53.740
OR REQUESTED FROM THE

01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:55.675
ADMINISTRATION APPROVED BY THE

01:56:55.742 --> 01:56:56.642
REGENTS.

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:58.244
SO IF THE THERE'S TO PROCESS

01:56:58.311 --> 01:57:00.279
THESE FOR THAT THEY VARY BY

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:02.248
CAMPUS SO THEY'RE NOT THE SAME

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:04.650
FOR ANY ANY TWO CAMPUSES.

01:57:04.717 --> 01:57:05.318
WELL THE REASON I GUESS THE

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:06.753
QUESTION IS THE ANALYSIS OU MAY

01:57:06.819 --> 01:57:08.388
HAVE SEEN REFERENCES CAMPUS

01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:10.356
BASED FEES AND REFERRING TO

01:57:10.423 --> 01:57:12.191
CAMPUS BASED FEES SET BY CHANCE

01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:13.793
OR IS AN APPROVED BY THE REGENTS

01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.561
THE ONE OF THE EXAMPLES WAS TO

01:57:15.628 --> 01:57:17.196
HELP ENSURE THE SAFETY OF

01:57:17.263 --> 01:57:18.831
STUDENTS SUCH AS THE SEISMIC.

01:57:18.898 --> 01:57:20.199
RETROFIT OF A BUILDING I DON'T

01:57:20.266 --> 01:57:23.336
KNOW IF THAT'S A CONCRETE

01:57:23.403 --> 01:57:24.370
EXAMPLE WHEN THEY UC SYSTEM BUT

01:57:24.437 --> 01:57:25.605
IF IT IS.

01:57:25.671 --> 01:57:27.173
I WAS WONDERING WHY IN THE WORLD

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:30.610
WE WOULD USE A CAMPUS BASE FEE.

01:57:30.676 --> 01:57:32.044
FOR THAT SERVER OF CAPITAL

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:34.514
IMPROVEMENT WE OUGHT TO BE.

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:36.482
WE OUGHT TO BE FUNDING THAT OUT

01:57:36.549 --> 01:57:37.984
OF THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET OR

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:40.420
THROUGH A BOND --

01:57:40.486 --> 01:57:42.822
AS OPPOSED TO CHARGING STUDENTS

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:44.223
TO SEISMICALLY RETROFIT THE

01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:47.260
BUILDING --

01:57:47.326 --> 01:57:48.895
IF THOSE THOSE CAMPUS BASED FEES

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:49.996
HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:51.697
REGIONS IN THE PAST THE BEST WAY

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:53.199
TO FUND CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAMS

01:57:53.266 --> 01:57:54.534
IS A DEAL BOND.

01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.035
DEFINITELY --

01:57:56.102 --> 01:57:57.937
WE ALSO HAVE AN INTERNAL CAPITAL

01:57:58.004 --> 01:57:59.539
OUTLAY PROCESS NOW THAT ALLOWS

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:02.375
US. TO SEEK APPROVAL FROM THE

01:58:02.442 --> 01:58:03.676
LEGISLATURE FOR SPECIFIC

01:58:03.743 --> 01:58:04.577
PROJECTS.

01:58:04.644 --> 01:58:06.012
AND THEN ONCE THAT APPROVAL IS

01:58:06.078 --> 01:58:09.248
GAINED WE CAN USE OUR INTERNAL

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:11.651
OPERATING REVENUES --

01:58:11.717 --> 01:58:13.186
AS COLLATERAL TOWARD.

01:58:13.252 --> 01:58:16.856
A DEATH PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS US

01:58:16.923 --> 01:58:18.391
TO WE HAVEN'T YOU SEE HAS NOT

01:58:18.458 --> 01:58:21.494
HAD A COUPON SINCE.

01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:22.495
TWO THOUSAND SIX SO WE'VE WE'VE

01:58:22.562 --> 01:58:24.096
BEEN WITHOUT THOSE CONSTRUCTION

01:58:24.163 --> 01:58:25.865
FUNDS FOR AWHILE YOU'LL LET US

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:28.267
KNOW HOWEVER IF CAN'T CAMPUS

BASED FEES TO USED TO DO.

01:58:30.002 --> 01:58:31.471
WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A CAPITAL

01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:33.206
PROJECT THAT THEY ART THERE ARE

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:35.007
USED FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS ON

01:58:35.074 --> 01:58:37.577
MULTIPLE CAMP WILL WELL?

01:58:37.643 --> 01:58:39.011

02:00:17.343 --> 02:00:19.378
EIGHT MILLION THAT WOULD HELP BY --

02:00:19.445 --> 02:00:20.947
IN THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

02:00:21.013 --> 02:00:22.648
INCREASING TUITION OURSELVES WE

02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:24.050

MONEY IS PART OF THE ENROLLMENT

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:29.922
REQUEST WE ALREADY WENT THROUGH

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:30.356
SO YOU DON'T.

02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:31.591

ONSITE TWENTY FOUR I WANTED TO

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:38.764
GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN IDEA

02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:40.833
OF HOW DOES THE UNIVERSITY SPEND

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.468
OUR STUDENT FEE REVENUE THAT WE

02:00:42.535 --> 02:00:43.970
RECEIVE --

02:00:44.036 --> 02:00:47.773
AND YOU'LL SEE THERE THAT ABOUT --

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.075
STUDENT FEES TO REMIND YOUR

02:00:49.141 --> 02:00:51.410
ABOUT 42% OF THE CORE FUNDS THIS

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:52.778
IS THE TUITION STUDENT SERVICES

02:00:52.845 --> 02:00:54.981
FEE COMPONENT OF THESE FEES.

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:57.550
AND 61% GO TO INSTRUCTION SO

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:59.151
THIS IS TO PAY.

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:00.519
FOR A OT OF RANK FACULTY

02:01:00.586 --> 02:01:03.556
LECTURERS ARE GRADUATE STUDENTS

02:01:03.623 --> 02:01:04.890
DOCTORS --

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:07.360
ANOTHER 27% GOES TO FINANCIAL

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:08.828
AID AND THE REASON THE FINANCIAL

02:01:08.894 --> 02:01:11.230
IS NOT THE FULL 33% IS BECAUSE

02:01:11.297 --> 02:01:14.367
THERE'S A HISTORICAL --

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:16.235
BASELINE TO IT WHERE IT USED TO

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:17.870
BE A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THIRD

02:01:17.937 --> 02:01:19.505
AND THEN IT'S A THIRD ON THE

02:01:19.572 --> 02:01:20.840
MARGINAL INCREASES.

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:21.974
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS BUT

02:01:22.041 --> 02:01:25.778
WE'RE PUTTING 23% OF 27% OF OF

02:01:25.845 --> 02:01:26.779
OUR FEES --

02:01:26.846 --> 02:01:29.148
INTO FINANCIAL AID.

02:01:29.215 --> 02:01:31.250

PROVIDERS ONE TIME FUNDING.

02:01:42.428 --> 02:01:44.363

A ONE MORE COMMON SIR I JUST

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:38.284
WANTED TO NOTE THAT --

02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:40.686
YOU SEE DOES HAVE A EXTENSIVE

02:02:40.753 --> 02:02:42.788
FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM AND IN OF

02:02:42.855 --> 02:02:44.590
THE LAST FISCAL YEAR THAT WE

OUR STUDENTS DID NOT PAY TUITION

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:51.664
BECAUSE FINANCIAL AID COVERED

02:02:51.731 --> 02:02:52.898
FOR THAT FOR THEM.

02:02:52.965 --> 02:02:54.433
THAT'S PRIMARILY THROUGH THE CAL

PROGRAM I NOTICED ON THE AGENDA

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:02.541
I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY

02:03:02.608 --> 02:03:03.843
IMPRESSIVE I WASN'T AWARE THAT

02:03:03.909 --> 02:03:04.143
[inaudible]

02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:10.616
VERY GOOD.

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:12.618
ARE WE ON THE NEXT TO BE READY

02:03:12.685 --> 02:03:14.620
FOR ISSUE NUMBER.

02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:15.821
FOUR YES WE'RE MOVING THROUGH

02:03:20.593 --> 02:03:21.427
DOLLARS --

I'M GOING GENERAL FUND FOR

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:23.963
DEGREE TEAM IS TO INSERVICE

02:03:24.029 --> 02:03:25.397
PROGRAMS THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW

02:03:25.464 --> 02:03:27.199
THE CITY TO HIRE NEEDED FACULTY

02:03:27.266 --> 02:03:29.101
AND OFFER SUPPORT SERVICES THAT

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:29.602
BETTER ENABLE.

02:03:29.668 --> 02:03:30.669
NOW COMES.

02:03:30.736 --> 02:03:32.171
AND IMPROVE TIME TO DEGREE AT

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:35.741
THE UC HAS BROAD DISCRETION USE

02:03:35.808 --> 02:03:36.308
THESE FUNDS TO ACHIEVE THOSE

02:03:36.375 --> 02:03:38.444
GOALS.

02:03:38.511 --> 02:03:38.711
LA -- ANY

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:40.045
COMMENT.

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:40.813
UP UP ALREADY THREE ISSUES FOR

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:44.049
THE THE FIRST --

02:03:44.116 --> 02:03:45.985
ISSUE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS THE

02:03:46.051 --> 02:03:47.620
EXTENT TO WHICH OF THE THIS

02:03:47.686 --> 02:03:49.355
FUNDING WOULD ADDRESS A PRIORITY

02:03:49.421 --> 02:03:51.023
OF OF THE LEGISLATURE --

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:52.391
OBVIOUSLY THE STATE HAS AN

02:03:52.458 --> 02:03:53.058
INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:54.727
STUDENTS SUCCEED WHEN THEY GET

02:03:54.794 --> 02:03:56.128
TO COLLEGE --

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:57.463
YOU SEE STUDENTS HAVE THE

02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:59.932
HIGHEST GRADUATION RATES --

02:03:59.999 --> 02:04:01.333
COMPARED TO THE STUDENTS AT CSUN

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:03.202
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE PAST

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:04.837
THE STATE HAS PRIORITIZED IN

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:06.539
SUCCESS RESOURCES FOR CS YOU IN

02:04:06.605 --> 02:04:07.606
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

02:04:07.673 --> 02:04:08.774
REALLY FOCUSED ITS POLICY

02:04:08.841 --> 02:04:10.342
ATTENTION THAT YOU SEE ON OTHER

02:04:10.409 --> 02:04:12.211
PRIORITIES LIKE CONTROLLING

02:04:12.278 --> 02:04:14.380
COSTS INSURING ACCESS IMPROVING

02:04:14.446 --> 02:04:15.815
BUDGET TRANSPARENCY.

02:04:15.881 --> 02:04:17.650
THAT'S BEEN A REASONABLE WAY TO

02:04:17.716 --> 02:04:19.418
APPROACH THE THE DIFF SEGMENTS

02:04:19.485 --> 02:04:20.753
AND THEY'RE DIFFERENT --

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.621
POLICY ISSUES ONE THING WE WOULD

02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:23.355
NOTE THOUGH --

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:24.790
IF YOU GO TO PAGE TWENTY OF YOUR

02:04:24.857 --> 02:04:26.625
AGENDA AS WE RESEARCH THIS

02:04:26.692 --> 02:04:28.494
PROPOSAL WE DID.

02:04:28.561 --> 02:04:34.133
LEARN THAT YOU SEE IT HAS --

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.034
PRETTY PERSISTENT.

02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:36.769
ACTUATION RATE GAPS BETWEEN US

02:04:36.836 --> 02:04:37.970
DIFFERENT A GREAT RACE AND

02:04:38.037 --> 02:04:38.537
ETHNICITY GROUPS.

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:39.138
ON THIS IS TRUE THE OTHER TWO

02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:40.606
SEGMENTS TRUE BUT IT IS PRESENT

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:42.474
AT UC -- AND

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:44.176
THIS WEEK WE'VE THIS THIS VERY

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:45.778
WELL COULD BE A PRIORITY FOR THE

02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:47.213
COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER AS IT

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:49.748
SWINGS OTHER BUDGET.

02:04:49.815 --> 02:04:51.317
IS OF DECISIONS.

02:04:51.383 --> 02:04:52.451
THE SECOND ISSUE FOR THE

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:53.385
COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER IS HOW

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:54.553
THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED AS THE

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:56.155
ADMINISTRATION NOTED YOU SEE

02:04:56.222 --> 02:04:56.822
WOULD HAVE.

02:04:56.889 --> 02:04:58.490
A BROAD DISCRETION TO ALLOCATE

02:04:58.557 --> 02:04:59.458
THESE FUNDS TWO CAMPUSES IN

02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:01.227
KANSAS WITH A BROAD DISCRETION

02:05:01.293 --> 02:05:03.762
TO USE THESE FUNDS TO ADDRESS

02:05:03.829 --> 02:05:05.364
STUDENT SUCCESS ISSUES --

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:06.932
AND USUALLY HAS DEVELOPED A LONG

02:05:06.999 --> 02:05:08.901
TERM PLAN WHICH YOU'LL HEAR

02:05:08.968 --> 02:05:10.102
ABOUT -- TO

02:05:10.169 --> 02:05:11.470
RICH AND IMPROVE FOR YOUR

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:12.872
GRADUATION RATES IMPROVE

02:05:12.938 --> 02:05:14.173
GRADUATION RATES AT CERTAIN

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:15.774
CAMPUSES WHERE THEY ARE LOWER.

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:17.009
AND ALSO REDUCE A GRADUATION

02:05:17.076 --> 02:05:21.180
RATE ETHNICITY AND THEY'VE ALSO --

02:05:21.247 --> 02:05:24.049
SUGGESTED SOME HIGH LEVEL.

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:26.452
USERS OF THE FUNDS FOR NINETEEN

02:05:26.518 --> 02:05:27.086
TWENTY THEY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED A

02:05:27.152 --> 02:05:29.154
MORE DETAILED EXPENDITURE PLAN

02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:29.755
AND HOW CAMPUSES WOULD USE THE

02:05:29.822 --> 02:05:30.723
FUNDS.

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:32.791
NOT CONCERN HERE IS IT'S NOT AND

02:05:32.858 --> 02:05:34.827
YOU SEE ALSO --

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:38.631
A IS HE ALSO SAYS THAT CAMPUSES

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:40.466
WILL HAVE A LOT OF OF

02:05:40.532 --> 02:05:42.001
FLEXIBILITY DECIDE HOW THEY

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:43.102
ALLOCATE THE FUNDS SO OUR

02:05:43.168 --> 02:05:44.603
CONCERN HERE.

02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:45.271
IS THAT --

02:05:45.337 --> 02:05:46.505
IT'S UNCLEAR HOW EXACTLY HOW THE

02:05:46.572 --> 02:05:48.040

02:05:48.107 --> 02:05:49.041
UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE FUNDS

02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:50.442
WOULD ACCOMPLISH AND ALSO IT'S

02:05:50.509 --> 02:05:51.543

OBJECTIVES THAT YOU SEE WANTS TO

INCOME STUDENTS --

02:09:44.143 --> 02:09:46.478

THOUSAND DOLLARS PER RENTAL

02:09:47.212 --> 02:09:49.348

02:09:49.414 --> 02:09:51.917
THERE IS STILL AN ELEVEN POINT

02:09:51.984 --> 02:09:54.153
7% FOUR YEAR DEGREE ATTAINMENT

02:09:54.219 --> 02:09:55.587
GAP BETWEEN THOSE STUDENTS.

02:09:55.654 --> 02:09:57.689
WHEN STUDENTS STAY LONGER SOME

02:09:57.756 --> 02:09:59.525
OF THE IMPACTS ARE THERE TAKING

02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:01.193
UP A SEAT ANOTHER STUDENT CAN

02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.161
COME INTO?

02:10:02.227 --> 02:10:03.662
OF AND ALSO THEY'RE TAKING ON

02:10:03.729 --> 02:10:06.331
MORE PERSONAL LOANS BECAUSE

02:10:06.398 --> 02:10:08.033
AFTER CAL GRANT BEGINS TO RUN

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.468
OUT AFTER FOUR YEARS.

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:11.403
THE UNIVERSITY STEPS IN AND A

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:12.237
FIFTY YEAR TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

02:10:12.304 --> 02:10:13.605

02:10:13.672 --> 02:10:16.842
FINANCIAL AID.

02:10:16.909 --> 02:10:17.976
BUT THEN --

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:18.644
THAT THIS THE FINANCIAL AID

02:10:18.710 --> 02:10:19.945
BEGINS TO RUN OUT AND STUDENTS

02:10:20.012 --> 02:10:22.581
BEGIN TO HAVE TO RELY ON LOANS --

02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:23.949
SO WE WANT TO GET THEM GRADUATED

02:10:24.016 --> 02:10:25.751
FASTER SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

02:10:25.817 --> 02:10:27.352
TO TAKE OUT THOSE LOANS IF

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:28.987
THEY'RE STAYING LONGER BECAUSE

02:10:29.054 --> 02:10:32.057
OF KNOWING WHICH COURSES TO TAKE.

02:10:32.124 --> 02:10:33.458
TO DO THE REMEDIAL COURSES KEEP

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:35.827
THEM.

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:38.030
ON CAMPUS LONGER.

02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:39.998
WE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY REMEDIAL

02:10:40.065 --> 02:10:42.668
COURSES BUT YES IT'S OFTEN

02:10:42.734 --> 02:10:44.703
REPEATING COURSES NOT REALIZING

02:10:44.770 --> 02:10:46.238
WHAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE AND

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:47.039
THAT'S THERE IN LIES THE

02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:49.141
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE C. ISSUE

02:10:49.208 --> 02:10:52.110
SYSTEM AND THE ADMISSION.

02:10:52.177 --> 02:10:54.279
PRACTICES THERE AND YOU SEIZE

02:10:54.346 --> 02:10:56.114
YOUR STUDENTS GENERALLY COME TO

02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:58.717
YOU BECAUSE OF A THROUGH G..

02:10:58.784 --> 02:11:01.820
QUALIFIED TO STEP RIGHT INTO THE

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:03.989
ENGLISH ONE OH ONE OR MATH.

02:11:04.056 --> 02:11:05.958
ONE SOON YES THAT'S CORRECT OUR

02:11:06.024 --> 02:11:08.193
STUDENTS ARE THE TAPPED TOP

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:09.461
TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT.

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:10.796
OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL

02:11:10.862 --> 02:11:12.564
GRADUATE SO THERE ARE COME TO US

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:13.899
BETTER PREPARED.

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:16.335
SO THE SIX YEAR ISSUE.

02:11:16.401 --> 02:11:18.470
IN PRT HAS TO DO WITH I GUESS

02:11:18.537 --> 02:11:19.771
YOU MENTION REPEATING CHORUSES

02:11:19.838 --> 02:11:21.673
AND NON AVAILABILITY OF COURSE

02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:23.642
IS NOT A NON AVAILABILITY OF

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:24.977
COURSES THEY NEED FOR THEIR

02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:26.845
MAJOR TO GRADUATE WHAT WE CALL

BOTTOM THE COURSES.

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:29.314
SO THOSE COURSES THAT END UP

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:31.283
HAVING A LONG WAIT LISTED THEN

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:32.184
STUDENTS.

02:11:32.251 --> 02:11:33.952
AND OF NOT GETTING THE CLASS AND

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:35.587
THEY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT

02:11:35.654 --> 02:11:37.222
TERM IN ORDER TO TAKE IT

02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:39.057
CONSUMER INTEREST IN ONLINE.

02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:40.759
AND YOUR INTEREST AND PERHAPS

THE BOTTLE NECK WERE WHERE IT'S

02:11:45.097 --> 02:11:47.199

BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT --

02:11:55.507 --> 02:11:58.810
THE BEST KIND IN THE CLASSROOM

02:11:58.877 --> 02:11:59.411

AS WELL AND DO WE KNOW WHETHER

02:12:23.402 --> 02:12:25.470
THE SIX YEAR PROBLEM OR BEYOND

IS IS CAUSED IN PART BY CHANGES

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:29.875
IN MAJORS.

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:31.109
SOME OF IT IS I DON'T HAVE THAT

AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:08.780
REMAIN GAPS IN THE GRADUATION

AND GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MATTER.

02:13:23.962 --> 02:13:25.464
GRADUATING FASTER USUALLY MEANS

02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:27.232
LESS DEATH AND STUDENTS ARE THAT

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:29.801
THE STUDENTS ARE TAKING ON IN

02:13:29.868 --> 02:13:30.669
NINETEEN TWENTY A PORTION OF THE

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:32.704
REQUESTED SIXTY MILLION WOULD BE

02:13:32.771 --> 02:13:34.072
USED TO HIRE.

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:35.540
THIRTY SEVEN FACULTY THAT WERE

02:13:35.607 --> 02:13:37.376
SHOWN ON SLIDE TWENTY ONE YOU

02:13:37.442 --> 02:13:38.310
DON'T NEED TO GO BACK BUT THERE

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:41.313
WERE TWO ROWS AND AS THE STUDENT

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:42.981
SUCCESS INITIATIVES THIRTY SEVEN

02:13:43.048 --> 02:13:45.517
FACULTY WOULD BE HIRED IN

02:13:45.584 --> 02:13:46.151
NINETEEN TWENTY WITH THESE FUNDS

02:13:46.218 --> 02:13:46.985
THE SIXTY MILLION.

02:13:47.052 --> 02:13:48.286
OF THESE ADDITIONAL LOTTERING

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:49.721
FACULTY WILL BE NEEDED TO HELP

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:51.523
ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF GRADUATING

02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:53.558
STUDENTS FASTER PARTICULAR WITH

02:13:53.625 --> 02:13:54.893
FIRST YEAR PROGRAMMING

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.428
CURRICULAR INNOVATIONS.

02:13:56.495 --> 02:13:59.731
pSUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM.

02:13:59.798 --> 02:14:00.932
THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDS WILL

02:14:00.999 --> 02:14:02.534
BE SPENT ON THE CAMPUS

02:14:02.601 --> 02:14:04.102
STRATEGIES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

02:14:04.169 --> 02:14:05.170
STUDENTS.

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:06.405
STUDENT SERVICES AND ENSURE THAT

02:14:06.471 --> 02:14:08.707
ACADEMICALLY STUDENTS STAY ON

02:14:08.774 --> 02:14:11.576
TRACK -- SO

02:14:11.643 --> 02:14:13.578
SLIDE TWENTY SEVEN INCLUDES A

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:16.615
BREAKDOWN OF HOW WE WOULD SPEND --

02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:19.418
SPEND THE FUNDING FOR THE SIXTY

02:14:19.484 --> 02:14:21.153
MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU'LL SEE

02:14:21.219 --> 02:14:22.687
WE HAVE VARIOUS PROGRAMS OF

02:14:22.754 --> 02:14:23.488
WHERE.

02:14:23.555 --> 02:14:25.390
SYSTEM WIDE INTENDING TO SPEND

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:27.926
THE FUNDS ON ADVISING AND HIRING

02:14:27.993 --> 02:14:29.694
NEW FACULTY ARE THE LARGEST OF

02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:31.129
THE TWO MAKING CERTAIN THAT

02:14:31.196 --> 02:14:32.697
STUDENTS KNOW WHICH CLASSES THEY

02:14:32.764 --> 02:14:34.266
NEED TO TAKE UNDERSTAND WHICH

02:14:34.332 --> 02:14:36.802
CLASSES CAN BE SWAPPED OUT FOR

02:14:36.868 --> 02:14:37.102
WHICH ONES.

02:14:37.169 --> 02:14:38.069
AND SO FORTH.

02:14:38.136 --> 02:14:40.038
AND THEN ON SLIDE TWENTY EIGHT I

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:41.973
GIVE YOUR KIND OF A BUSY SLIDE

02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:44.109
BUT SAMPLING OF WHAT THE VARIOUS

02:14:44.176 --> 02:14:45.477
CAMPUSES WOULD DO.

02:14:45.544 --> 02:14:47.245
IF THEY RECEIVED THESE FINDS

02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:48.613
THAT THEY TOLD US THAT ARE

02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:50.415
WITHIN THEIR PLANS.

02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:51.516
SOME OF THESE THINGS INCLUDE --

02:14:51.583 --> 02:14:55.253
THING AND COHORTS WHERE YOU HAVE

02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:56.755
A SMALLER GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:58.390
SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN PEER TO

02:14:58.457 --> 02:14:59.591
PEER MENTORING.

02:14:59.658 --> 02:15:01.293
AND TAKE COURSES TOGETHER AND

02:15:01.359 --> 02:15:02.761
WE'RE FINDINGTHAT THIS MAY BE

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:04.396
AN APPROACH --

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:06.865
TO HELP FIRST YEAR AND

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:07.899
UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY

02:15:07.966 --> 02:15:10.001
STUDENTS FEEL MORE ACCEPTED IN

02:15:10.068 --> 02:15:11.937
THE UNIVERSITY SETTING BY HAVING

02:15:12.003 --> 02:15:13.472
THIS CALL HER TO HELP THEM.

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:14.940
TAKE CLASSES THEY WOULD STUDY

02:15:15.006 --> 02:15:16.274
TOGETHER THEY WOULD BE IN THE

02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:18.343
VARIOUS COURSES TOGETHER A MOVE

02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:19.644
TO THE PROGRAMS --

02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:22.080
AS A UNIT AND I WOULD HELP

02:15:22.147 --> 02:15:23.949
CREATE SOME COHESION WITH THEM --

02:15:24.015 --> 02:15:25.383
A LOT OF THE FUNDS WOULD BE

02:15:25.450 --> 02:15:26.885
SPENT ON ADDITIONAL ADVISING.

02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:29.087
ADDITIONAL DATA TRACKING TOOLS

02:15:29.154 --> 02:15:31.289
THAT WOULD HELLO ADVISERS WHEN A

02:15:31.356 --> 02:15:33.191
STUDENT STOPS TAKING THE COURSES

02:15:33.258 --> 02:15:36.127
THEY NEED. FOR THEIR MAJOR --

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:37.829
THAT WOULD HELP THE ADVISER

02:15:37.896 --> 02:15:39.364
IDENTIFY THAT STUDENT BEING

02:15:39.431 --> 02:15:41.366
PERSONAL CONTACT AND LET THE

02:15:41.433 --> 02:15:43.101
STUDENTS KNOW HOW TO GET BACK ON

02:15:43.168 --> 02:15:44.703
TRACK ACADEMICALLY.

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:46.304
HOW ARE YOU --

02:15:46.371 --> 02:15:48.073
WILL THERE BE A SEE IF I CAN ASK

02:15:48.139 --> 02:15:49.241
A QUESTION.

02:15:49.307 --> 02:15:51.042
WILL THERE BE A TALKING ABOUT

02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:52.477
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS A

02:15:52.544 --> 02:15:54.379
REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND AND

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:55.680
ANALYSIS.

02:15:55.747 --> 02:15:57.883
PROCESS WHERE THESE VARIOUS NEW

02:15:57.949 --> 02:16:00.585
PROGRAMS COULD BE ANALYZED IN

02:16:00.652 --> 02:16:02.287
THE BEST OF THEM.

02:16:02.354 --> 02:16:04.456
SORT OF RANKED IN DECISIONS MADE

02:16:04.523 --> 02:16:06.725
AS TO WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE AND

02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:08.527
WHICH SHOULD NOT.

02:16:08.593 --> 02:16:09.995
I WOULD ASSUME THAT.

02:16:10.061 --> 02:16:12.163
SOME OF THESE MAY BE MORE

02:16:12.230 --> 02:16:13.865
SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS.

02:16:13.932 --> 02:16:15.767
I WOULD ASSUME SO SIR SIR AS

02:16:15.834 --> 02:16:17.235
WELL -- WE

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:19.437
WERE AT THE MOMENT LONG LOOK

02:16:19.504 --> 02:16:20.805
INTO THE CAMPUSES TO DO THEIR

02:16:20.872 --> 02:16:22.274
OWN INTERNAL ASSESSMENT ON

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:23.375
WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAMS ARE

02:16:23.441 --> 02:16:24.576
SUCCESSFUL.

02:16:24.643 --> 02:16:25.510
BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK

02:16:25.577 --> 02:16:26.945
WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON

02:16:27.012 --> 02:16:28.547
REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT THE

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:30.215
UNIVERSITY COULD COME BACK AND

02:16:30.282 --> 02:16:31.182
TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHICH ONE OF

02:16:31.249 --> 02:16:34.286
OUR PROGRAMS COULD BE REPLICATED

02:16:34.352 --> 02:16:35.854
SYSTEM WIDE AND WHICH ONES HAD A

02:16:35.921 --> 02:16:36.821
REAL IMPACT.

02:16:36.888 --> 02:16:37.589
WELL -- THE

02:16:37.656 --> 02:16:38.790
REASON I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION

02:16:38.857 --> 02:16:40.792
IS I MEAN IT COULD VERY WELL BE

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:43.695
FOR EXAMPLE THAT [inaudible]

02:16:43.762 --> 02:16:45.530
BERKELEY'S PROGRAM.

02:16:45.597 --> 02:16:47.332
INCREASING ACADEMIC ADVISORS AND

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:49.100
CETERA AND THE WAY THE BERKELEY

02:16:49.167 --> 02:16:52.070
IS STRUCTURES THAT ULTIMATELY --

02:16:52.137 --> 02:16:53.905
IS BETTER THAN THE ONE THE

02:16:53.972 --> 02:16:55.607
PROGRAM THAT SAN DIEGO PUT IN

02:16:55.674 --> 02:16:56.875
PLAY IT PUTS IN PLACE FOR

02:16:56.942 --> 02:16:58.877
STUDENT SUCCESS IN TERMS OF

02:16:58.944 --> 02:17:00.512
OUTCOMES.

02:17:00.579 --> 02:17:03.481
AND SAN DIEGO MAYBE NEEDS TO

02:17:03.548 --> 02:17:04.015
TAKE A LOOK AT BERKELEY'S

02:17:04.082 --> 02:17:05.684
PROGRAM.

02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:06.952
OR VICE VERSA HEAVEN FORBID

02:17:07.018 --> 02:17:08.453
RIVERSIDE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:10.388
IDEA THAN BERKELEY WELL THEN WE

02:17:10.455 --> 02:17:11.690
WOULD TAKE RIVERSIDE IS THAT

02:17:11.756 --> 02:17:13.391
MAKES SENSE YES IT MAKES SENSE

02:17:13.458 --> 02:17:14.893
TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES ACROSS

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:17.629
THE SYSTEM AND SEE WHICH HOW HOW

02:17:17.696 --> 02:17:19.064
THE PROGRAMS ARE STRUCTURED.

02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:20.365
THAT MAY HAVE MADE THE MORE

02:17:20.432 --> 02:17:21.733
SUCCESSFUL THAN A DIFFERENT

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:23.101
MATTER OF STRUCTURING A SIMILAR

02:17:23.168 --> 02:17:25.937
PROGRAM RIGHT IN THE MILITARY WE

02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:26.538
CALL IT CROSS FEED BUT I DON'T

02:17:26.605 --> 02:17:27.138
KNOW.

02:17:27.205 --> 02:17:28.306
YOU YOU WOULD CROSS FEED YOUR

02:17:28.373 --> 02:17:30.775
PROGRAMS AND SO PEOPLE COULD

02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:32.344
CHERRY PICK THE BEST ONES AND

02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:34.112
STEAL THEM AND PUT THEM IN PLACE

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:34.980
INSTEAD OF THE ONES THAT THEY

02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:36.781
TRIED AND PERHAPS WEREN'T AS

QUESTIONS ILIO.

02:18:51.456 --> 02:18:52.791
WE HAD A NUMBER OF CONCERNS OF

02:18:52.857 --> 02:18:54.526
THIS PROPOSAL AND ALL RACE THREE

02:18:54.592 --> 02:18:56.227
CONCERNS FOR THE COMMITTEE.

02:18:56.294 --> 02:18:58.830
THE FIRST IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL

02:18:58.897 --> 02:19:01.633
LACKS A LOT OF SPECIFICS.

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:03.201
ON HOW THE FUND TO BE SPENT THE

02:19:03.268 --> 02:19:05.437
ADMINISTRATION NOTES THAT THE

02:19:05.503 --> 02:19:06.371
FRONT IS HERE AND IT SEEMS BASED

02:19:06.438 --> 02:19:07.906
ON WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:10.442
INDICATED THAT THE KEY PRIORITY

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:11.109
FOR THE FUNDS WOULD BE TO CREATE

02:19:11.176 --> 02:19:11.543
NEW BACK.

02:19:11.609 --> 02:19:13.144
BACHELOR'S DEGREE COMPLETION

02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:15.046
PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:19:15.113 --> 02:19:16.548
HAVE SOME COLLEGE BUT NO DEGREE

02:19:16.614 --> 02:19:17.449
THE MISSION MINISTRATION NOTES

02:19:17.515 --> 02:19:18.917
OTHER ACTIVITIES THOSE SUCH AS

02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:19.684
OUT REACH.

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:21.052
AN EXPANDING CERTIFICATE

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:23.321
PROGRAMS AND THOSE ARE VERY ALL

02:19:23.388 --> 02:19:24.923
DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT

02:19:24.989 --> 02:19:25.890
POTENTIALLY GO TO ADDRESS

02:19:25.957 --> 02:19:26.958
DIFFERENT ISSUES.

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:29.060
WITHOUT MORE SPECIFICITY ON THE

02:19:29.127 --> 02:19:30.061
USE OF THE FUNDS IT'S DIFFICULT

02:19:30.128 --> 02:19:31.796
TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE FUNDS

02:19:31.863 --> 02:19:34.432
WOULD ACCOMPLISH AND ALSO IT'S

02:19:34.499 --> 02:19:35.633
DIFFICULT.

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:37.602
TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE

02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:40.672
PROPOSED FUNDING LEVELS EVEN IF

02:19:40.739 --> 02:19:41.940
THE LEGISLATURE HAD MORE

02:19:42.006 --> 02:19:43.007
SPECIFIC INFORMATION RIGHT

02:19:43.074 --> 02:19:44.476
INFORMATION.

02:19:44.542 --> 02:19:45.677
OF IT'S STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER

02:19:45.744 --> 02:19:47.445
STATE FUNDING IS NEEDED TO

02:19:47.512 --> 02:19:48.913
ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE.

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:50.448
USE THE EXTENSION IS A SELF

02:19:50.515 --> 02:19:52.083

OF A U. C. EXTENSION CENTERS.

02:19:54.619 --> 02:19:56.354
OF REGULAR OPERATING ACTIVITIES

02:19:56.421 --> 02:19:58.123
IS TO PLAN FOR AND DEVELOP NEW

02:19:58.189 --> 02:19:59.390
PROGRAMS.

02:19:59.457 --> 02:20:00.425
AND WE DON'T FEEL THAT THE

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:01.192
ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE A

02:20:01.259 --> 02:20:03.061
COMPELLING CASE THAT MORE STATE

02:20:03.128 --> 02:20:05.797
FUNDING IS IS NEEDED.

02:20:05.864 --> 02:20:07.465
TO CREATE THESE NEW PROGRAMS.

02:20:07.532 --> 02:20:09.033

THROUGH EXTENDED EDUCATION.

02:20:14.572 --> 02:20:15.740
AND THAT RAISES ADDITIONAL

02:20:15.807 --> 02:20:17.375
QUESTIONS FOR US WITH THESE

02:20:17.442 --> 02:20:18.676
PROPOSED NEW PROGRAMS BE

02:20:18.743 --> 02:20:20.345
DUPLICATIVE WOULD THEY BE ADDING

02:20:20.411 --> 02:20:21.212
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT

02:20:21.279 --> 02:20:22.747

THAT THEY ENROLL MORE STUDENTS

02:20:33.858 --> 02:20:35.160
AND HAVE LOWER GRADUATION RATES.

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:35.693
GIVEN THESE QUESTIONS WE

02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:36.394

CONCEPTS AND IDEAS IN THIS

02:20:55.346 --> 02:20:57.415
BUDGET I THINK IT'S REFRESHING

02:20:57.482 --> 02:21:00.118
AND THEY'RE ALL AREAS THAT NEED.

02:21:00.185 --> 02:21:01.619
TO NEED TO HAVE --

02:21:01.686 --> 02:21:03.321
DISCUSSION AND FOCUS ON THIS

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:04.856
PARTICULAR --

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:07.492
ONE I WAS UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT THE

02:21:07.559 --> 02:21:10.328
IN GAME.

02:21:10.395 --> 02:21:12.897
IS OR IS TO BE IS IT IS IT TO

TO ATTAIN A SKILL LEVEL --

02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:21.339
BECAUSE THE NOTE I MADE TO

02:21:21.406 --> 02:21:22.941
MYSELF ON THE AGENDA.

02:21:23.007 --> 02:21:24.709
ISN'T THIS REALLY THE MISSION OF

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:25.944
THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:27.545
SYSTEM INDOOR.

02:21:27.612 --> 02:21:29.514
C. T. E. N. THE EDUCATIONAL

02:21:29.581 --> 02:21:31.649
CONSORTIA THAT WE'VE STRUCTURED

02:21:31.716 --> 02:21:34.152
IN ANOTHER SETTING. TO FOCUS ON

02:21:34.219 --> 02:21:36.087
THE DEMAND SIDE JOBS AND SKILLS

02:21:36.154 --> 02:21:37.889
THAT ARE NEEDED AND DESIGN

02:21:37.956 --> 02:21:39.490
TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET THE

02:21:39.557 --> 02:21:41.459
NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS UP AND DOWN

02:21:41.526 --> 02:21:42.894
THE STATE.

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:44.162
THE GOAL HERE IS THE OTHER MANY

02:21:44.229 --> 02:21:45.964
STUDENTS THAT --

02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:47.432
THAT BUT LEAVE THE SCENE THEY

02:21:47.498 --> 02:21:48.700
HAVE QUITE A FEW AN INSTANT AND

02:21:48.766 --> 02:21:49.834
FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY ARE NOW

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:50.935
OUT OF THE SYSTEM WE WANT TO

02:21:51.002 --> 02:21:52.604
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PROGRAMS

02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:54.205
THERE ARE ACCESSIBLE FOR

02:21:54.272 --> 02:21:55.673
STUDENTS THAT. FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT

02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.442
BE WORKING --

02:21:57.509 --> 02:21:58.076
TO COME BACK AND COMPLETE THEIR

02:21:58.142 --> 02:22:00.345
DEGREE I MEAN IT'S NO SECRET

02:22:00.411 --> 02:22:02.180
THAT SETS THE WORKERS WITH

02:22:02.247 --> 02:22:03.948
BACHELOR'S DEGREES SIR FOR

02:22:04.015 --> 02:22:04.415
ASSISTANCE WITH OTHER

02:22:04.482 --> 02:22:05.583
CERTIFICATES. FOR MORE THAN

02:22:05.650 --> 02:22:08.119
STUDENTS WITHOUT THEM SO THE

02:22:08.186 --> 02:22:11.189
GOAL IS TO CREATE THE GET THOSE

02:22:11.256 --> 02:22:13.858
CREDENTIALS AND THEN SEEK HIGHER

02:22:13.925 --> 02:22:15.393
PAIRED PLACEMENT.

02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:15.960
SO THAT'S DOWN THE PASSAGE

02:22:16.027 --> 02:22:16.928
GREECE SIDE THERE IS A LARGE

02:22:16.995 --> 02:22:19.697
PROPORTION OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:21.232

IN TWO YEARS OF STEVE UNITS I

02:22:23.468 --> 02:22:24.602
THINK HE SEES MENTION THAT

02:22:24.669 --> 02:22:25.737
PREVIOUS HEARINGS OR OTHER

02:22:25.803 --> 02:22:26.638

PERHAPS WITH FEAR UNITS.

02:22:38.583 --> 02:22:39.984
MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND --

02:22:40.051 --> 02:22:41.486
ANOTHER CREDENTIAL THAT MAYBE

02:22:41.552 --> 02:22:43.187
NOT BE AS EXTENSIVE AS RASHES

02:22:43.254 --> 02:22:44.756
DEGREE BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE

02:22:44.822 --> 02:22:45.990
SKILLS AND EDUCATION THAT COULD

02:22:46.057 --> 02:22:53.131
BE CAPTURED AND AND SORT OF

WELL I'LL BE INTERESTED TO HEAR --

02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:56.834
UC'S PERSPECTIVE --

02:22:56.901 --> 02:22:58.369

FAMILY ISSUES.

02:23:07.578 --> 02:23:08.980
CAUSES THEM.

02:23:09.047 --> 02:23:10.682

02:23:10.748 --> 02:23:12.183
CAMPUS IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A

02:23:12.250 --> 02:23:13.818

PROGRAM WITH VARIOUS CAMPUSES IS

02:23:27.265 --> 02:23:29.000
REALLY THE PROPER PLACE FOR THIS

02:23:29.067 --> 02:23:31.202
SORT OF RETURN TO SCHOOL AND GET

02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:34.105

WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE

02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:47.986
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON THIS ITEM --

02:23:48.052 --> 02:23:48.853
WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT THE

02:23:50.588 --> 02:23:52.223
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS A

02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:53.257
ROLE -- IN

02:23:53.324 --> 02:23:55.326

NEVER GET A BACHELOR'S DEGREE --

02:24:25.056 --> 02:24:27.025
WE'RE STILL DEVELOPING THE PLAN

EXACTLY RUN THIS PROGRAM THIS IS

02:24:30.361 --> 02:24:31.629
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DID NOT

EITHER EX EXISTING OR NEW

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:10.601
CERTIFICATE STUFF WE WOULD

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:11.936
CREATE.

02:25:12.003 --> 02:25:13.337
SO THAT PEOPLE --

02:25:13.404 --> 02:25:17.141
WOULD FIND IT EASIER TO REENTER

02:25:17.208 --> 02:25:18.509
THE WORKFORCE.

02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:19.577
OF THIS FUNDING WOULD BE USED

02:25:19.644 --> 02:25:20.344
FOR OUTREACH TO FORMER UC

02:25:20.411 --> 02:25:21.879
STUDENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE WHO

02:25:21.946 --> 02:25:24.182
HAVE NOT ATTAINED A DEGREE --

02:25:24.248 --> 02:25:26.050
IT WILL BE USED FOR HIGH TOUCH

02:25:26.117 --> 02:25:27.718
STUDENT ACADEMIC SUPPORT SO A

02:25:27.785 --> 02:25:29.787
LOT OF BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN

02:25:29.854 --> 02:25:32.056
THE ADVISER AND STUDENT --

02:25:32.123 --> 02:25:33.624
AND FINANCIAL AID TO NEEDY

02:25:33.691 --> 02:25:36.094
STUDENTS TO PAY FOR THESE YOU

02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:38.062
SEE EXTENSION COURSES.

02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:41.833
SO ON SLIDE ON THIRTY YOU SEE A

02:25:41.899 --> 02:25:43.334
BIT ABOUT WHO THESE STUDENTS ARE

02:25:43.401 --> 02:25:45.736
WHO LEAVE WITHOUT A DEGREE --

02:25:45.803 --> 02:25:47.238
AND IT WAS QUITE SURPRISING TO

02:25:47.305 --> 02:25:48.706
ME PERSONALLY TO SEE.

02:25:48.773 --> 02:25:51.008
THAT 36% OF THOSE WHO DROP OUT

02:25:51.075 --> 02:25:52.810
DROP OFF WITH A HUNDRED UNITS OR

02:25:52.877 --> 02:25:54.912
MORE COMPLETED.

02:25:54.979 --> 02:25:57.415
A YOU SEE YOU NEED USUALLY ABOUT

02:25:57.482 --> 02:25:59.117
HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREE UNITS TO

02:25:59.183 --> 02:26:00.151
COMPLETE A DEGREE SO THE

02:26:00.218 --> 02:26:01.686
STUDENTS REPRESENT LOW HANGING

02:26:01.752 --> 02:26:03.221
FRUIT TO BRING THEM BACK.

02:26:03.287 --> 02:26:04.889
AND HAVE THEM COMPLETE THEIR

02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:07.692
DEGREES AND START PAYING --

02:26:07.759 --> 02:26:10.294
MORE TAXES A STATE GOT BETTER

02:26:10.361 --> 02:26:11.596
PAYING JOBS.

02:26:11.662 --> 02:26:13.297
UP IN TERMS OF YOU SEE HAVING

02:26:13.364 --> 02:26:16.067
ALREADY A PROGRAM LIKE THIS WE

02:26:16.134 --> 02:26:18.069
IF A STUDENT TAKES DROPS OUT AND

02:26:18.136 --> 02:26:20.004
COMES BACK WITHIN A SHORT AMOUNT

02:26:20.071 --> 02:26:22.373
OF TIME I BELIEVE IT'S TWO YEARS.

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:24.142
THEY CAN BE READMITTED THAT OUR

02:26:24.208 --> 02:26:25.810
CAMPUS OF ORIGIN.

02:26:25.877 --> 02:26:27.044
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A READMISSION

02:26:27.111 --> 02:26:31.149
PROGRAM WHO HAVE BEEN GONE. FOR

02:26:31.215 --> 02:26:33.284
FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS --

02:26:33.351 --> 02:26:35.153
THEY WOULD NEED TO APPLY THE UC

02:26:35.219 --> 02:26:37.555
CAMPUS AS A REGULAR

02:26:37.622 --> 02:26:39.090
UNDERGRADUATE.

02:26:39.157 --> 02:26:41.592
ADMIT WHICH IS HARDER FOR AN

02:26:41.659 --> 02:26:43.461
OLDER STUDENT --

02:26:43.528 --> 02:26:45.830
TO DO THAT [inaudible]

02:26:45.897 --> 02:26:47.765
AND HARDER PARTLY BECAUSE

02:26:47.832 --> 02:26:48.799
THERE'S NO FINANCIAL AID

02:26:48.866 --> 02:26:50.268
ASSOCIATED AND ALSO WE WOULD

02:26:50.334 --> 02:26:53.504
JUDGE THEM ON THEIR PRIOR GPA --

02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:55.473
SO BY BRINGING THEM IN FOR

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:57.175
EXTENSION HAVING THEM TAKE --

02:26:57.241 --> 02:26:59.377
EXTENSION COURSES --

02:26:59.443 --> 02:27:02.346
AND SHOW THAT THEY CAN EARN.

02:27:02.413 --> 02:27:03.481
GOOD GRADES WE WOULD THEN

02:27:03.548 --> 02:27:05.283
TRANSFER THOSE UNITS ON TO THE

02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:06.450
CAMPUS.

02:27:06.517 --> 02:27:09.587
AND HAVE THE CAMPUS OF MAJOR

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:11.122
GRANT THEM THE DEGREE WAS AS I

02:27:11.189 --> 02:27:13.191
SIT HERE.

02:27:13.257 --> 02:27:14.859
I MEAN I CAN THINK OF SOME I WAS

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:16.861
WONDERING WHY YOU SEE EXTENSION

02:27:16.928 --> 02:27:18.362
BUT I CAN THINK OF SOME.

02:27:18.429 --> 02:27:19.564
DEFINITE ADVANTAGES FOR THE TYPE

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:23.467
OF STUDENT GROUP THAT YOU'RE.

02:27:23.534 --> 02:27:24.869
HOPING TO HELP HERE.

02:27:24.936 --> 02:27:26.137
THE COURSES ARE GENERALLY TAUGHT

02:27:26.204 --> 02:27:29.340
IN THE EVENINGS.

02:27:29.407 --> 02:27:30.808
SO FOR SOMEONE WHO'S WORKING.

02:27:30.875 --> 02:27:32.310
FOR TAKING CARE OF A FAMILY

02:27:32.376 --> 02:27:34.512
THERE MAY BE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:27:34.579 --> 02:27:36.080
GO BACK IN AND COMPLETE THE

02:27:36.147 --> 02:27:37.715
COURSEBECAUSE OF THE EVENING

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:40.051
STRUCTURE OF UC EXTENSION.

02:27:40.117 --> 02:27:41.652
BUT I'M WONDERING DO WE HAVE ANY

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:43.321
IDEA FOR THESE STUDENTS WHO

02:27:43.387 --> 02:27:44.488
LEAVE.

02:27:44.555 --> 02:27:45.856
I MEAN ARE THERE CERTAIN COMMON

02:27:45.923 --> 02:27:49.093
COURSES THAT THEY LACK HOW HOW

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:51.429
WOULD YOU DESIGN A OF A PROGRAM

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:53.431
INSIDE OF YOU SEE EXTENSION TO

02:27:53.497 --> 02:27:54.732
ADDRESS [inaudible]

02:27:54.799 --> 02:27:56.934
VARIED [inaudible]

02:27:57.001 --> 02:27:59.170
ACADEMIC NEEDS.

02:27:59.237 --> 02:28:00.905
AM I MAKING YES YOU'RE MAKING

02:28:00.972 --> 02:28:01.872
SENSOR -- WE

02:28:01.939 --> 02:28:03.407
HAVE NOT YET CONSIDERED THIS I

02:28:03.474 --> 02:28:04.775
HAVEN'T SEEN THE ANALYSIS OF

02:28:04.842 --> 02:28:06.577
WHAT IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:08.145
AMONG THE STUDENTS.

02:28:08.212 --> 02:28:09.981
OTHER THAN THE NUMBER OF UNITS

02:28:10.047 --> 02:28:11.882
THEY COMPLETED PRIOR TO LEAVING

02:28:11.949 --> 02:28:14.051
THE UNIVERSITY AND THEN IN TERMS

02:28:14.118 --> 02:28:15.753
OF THE WELL I GUESS WE DON'T

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:18.789
HAVE THE PLAN YET BUT IN TERMS

02:28:18.856 --> 02:28:22.126
OF THE THE COST STRUCTURE IN THE

02:28:22.193 --> 02:28:24.095
THE FINANCES OF ALL OF THIS USE

02:28:24.161 --> 02:28:25.062
THE EXTENSION IS.

02:28:25.129 --> 02:28:26.197
MUCH DIFFERENT.

02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:27.698
AND OPERATES IN A MUCH DIFFERENT

02:28:27.765 --> 02:28:29.166
WAY.

02:28:29.233 --> 02:28:30.234
OBLIQUE FROM A BUDGETARY

02:28:30.301 --> 02:28:31.802
STANDPOINT INSIDE THE UC

02:28:31.869 --> 02:28:33.237
ORGANIZATION.

02:28:33.304 --> 02:28:34.605
FROM WHAT THE STUDENTS PAY TO

02:28:34.672 --> 02:28:37.074
GET IN WHAT THEY PAY TO GET

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:38.242
THEIR CERTIFICATE OR THEIR

02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:40.711
PROGRAM MUCH DIFFERENT THAN.

02:28:40.778 --> 02:28:42.780
THE TRADITIONAL UC CAMPUS COURSE

02:28:42.847 --> 02:28:45.349
THINK YES USUALLY THE EXTENSION

02:28:45.416 --> 02:28:47.051
COURSES ARE SELF SUPPORTING

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:48.586
MEANING THATTHEY HAVE TO THE

02:28:48.653 --> 02:28:50.454
FEES CHARGED THE STUDENTS HAVE

02:28:50.521 --> 02:28:51.956
TO COVER ALL OF THE EXPENDITURES

02:28:52.023 --> 02:28:53.090
OF RUNNING THAT EXTENSION

02:28:53.157 --> 02:28:54.425
PROGRAM.

02:28:54.492 --> 02:28:55.893
THE REASON YOU SEE EXTENSION WAS

02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:57.061
SELECTED AS THAT THEY DO A

02:28:57.128 --> 02:28:58.796
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OUTREACH

02:28:58.863 --> 02:29:00.564
CURRENTLY. TO TRY AND PULL IN

PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY WHO IS A

02:29:03.801 --> 02:29:05.403
STUDENT POPULATION WHO WOULD

02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:08.372
BENEFIT FROM THIS --

02:29:08.439 --> 02:29:11.208
THE CAMPUS DEPARTMENTS TWO

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:13.010
STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE STATEWIDE

02:29:13.077 --> 02:29:14.912
AND HAVE DROPPED OUT ALSO USE

02:29:14.979 --> 02:29:16.580
THE EXTENSION IS WHERE WE RUN A

02:29:16.647 --> 02:29:20.017
LOT OF ONLINE COURSES OUT OF SO

02:29:20.084 --> 02:29:22.019
MAKING THOSE AVAILABLE.

02:29:22.086 --> 02:29:23.554
THE DATE THEY RUN THEY OPERATE A

02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:25.323
LOT OF THE PLATFORMS THEY DO A

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:27.024
LOT OF THE CONTRACTING TO

02:29:27.091 --> 02:29:28.192
DEVELOP THE COURSES.

02:29:28.259 --> 02:29:29.093
AND THE MAINTENANCE --

02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:31.062
IS DONE.

02:29:31.128 --> 02:29:33.230
BY EXTENSION FOR VARIOUS.

02:29:33.297 --> 02:29:35.399
PROGRAMS ALREADY FOR ONLINE SO

02:29:35.466 --> 02:29:37.001
IF WE WERE TO USE ONLINE

02:29:37.068 --> 02:29:39.036
PLATFORMS TO OFFER THE STUDENTS

02:29:39.103 --> 02:29:40.738
OF WAY TO COMPLETE THEIR COURSES.

02:29:40.805 --> 02:29:42.206
EXTENSION WOULD ALREADY HAVE

02:29:42.273 --> 02:29:43.808
SOME OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN

02:29:43.874 --> 02:29:44.642
PLACE.

02:29:44.709 --> 02:29:46.143
AND IT'S A MUCH MORE USER

02:29:46.210 --> 02:29:48.512
FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT FOR SOMEONE

02:31:56.307 --> 02:31:58.976
FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHETHER

02:31:59.043 --> 02:31:59.543
THIS WOULD SUPPORT FINANCIAL

02:31:59.610 --> 02:32:01.045
LATER FOOD AND HOUSING

02:32:01.111 --> 02:32:05.149
INITIATIVES OR A MIX OF THE TWO

02:32:05.216 --> 02:32:06.884
AND YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY.

02:32:06.951 --> 02:32:07.918
GENERALLY WILL PROVIDE MORE

02:32:07.985 --> 02:32:08.719
INFORMATION ON ON WHERE THEY'RE

02:32:08.786 --> 02:32:09.854
AT IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:11.589
IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THIS

02:32:11.655 --> 02:32:13.123
ISSUE WE HAVE SOME ISSUES FOR

02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.991
THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER AS

02:32:14.058 --> 02:32:15.392
IT'S REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL.

02:32:15.459 --> 02:32:16.861
THE FIRST IS TO THINK ABOUT THE

02:32:16.927 --> 02:32:18.863
UNDERLYING CAUSES OF FOOD AND

02:32:18.929 --> 02:32:20.898
HOUSING AND SECURITY --

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:22.566
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RATES OF EACH

02:32:22.633 --> 02:32:24.668
EACH OF OUR FOOD SECURITY AT UC

02:32:24.735 --> 02:32:26.270
OTHER ROUGHLY COMPARABLE TO

02:32:26.337 --> 02:32:27.371
RATES THAT ARE REPORTED BY THE

02:32:27.438 --> 02:32:29.673
OTHER TWO SEGMENTS YES YOU

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:30.774
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

02:32:30.841 --> 02:32:32.476
BUT THEY'RE MUCH HIGHER THAN UP

02:32:32.543 --> 02:32:34.378
INSECURITY FOR THE STATE

02:32:34.445 --> 02:32:36.514
POPULATION FOR EXAMPLE.

02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:37.314
ENDED ACCORDING TO YOU SEE

02:32:37.381 --> 02:32:38.482
BETWEEN SECURITIES VERY

02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:39.850
PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT THE STUDENT

02:32:39.917 --> 02:32:41.519
BODY FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WHO

02:32:41.585 --> 02:32:43.521
COME FROM HOUSEHOLDS EARNING A

02:32:43.587 --> 02:32:44.121
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:32:44.188 --> 02:32:45.723
OR MORE A YEAR ALSO REPORT FOOD

02:32:45.789 --> 02:32:47.658
SECURITY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THEM

02:32:47.725 --> 02:32:48.926
REPORT THAT.

02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:49.894
SO IF YOU APPEAR TO BE VERY

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:50.661
PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT --

02:32:50.728 --> 02:32:52.329
THE STUDENT BODY.

02:32:52.396 --> 02:32:53.264
THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF

02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:55.199
CAUSES BEHIND THIS WOULDN'T

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:56.534
SECURITY COULD RANGE FROM.

02:32:56.600 --> 02:32:58.469
LACK OF RESOURCES TO PERHAPS

02:32:58.536 --> 02:32:59.670
LACK OF AWARENESS OF VARIOUS

02:32:59.737 --> 02:33:01.105
FINANCIAL AID AND PUBLIC

02:33:01.171 --> 02:33:02.907
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:33:02.973 --> 02:33:04.909
AVAILABLE TO COVER COSTS.

02:33:04.975 --> 02:33:05.576
STUDENTS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD

02:33:05.643 --> 02:33:06.877
COULD ALSO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY

02:33:06.944 --> 02:33:08.512
THAN WHAT'S ASSUMED AND YOU SEE

02:33:08.579 --> 02:33:10.381
IS A MODEL FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY --

02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:12.950
BAR LESSER WORK LAST WERE --

02:33:13.017 --> 02:33:15.119
PREFER TO CONTRIBUTE CLASS --

02:33:15.185 --> 02:33:17.054
ARE ARE HAVE HIGHER COSTS THAN

02:33:17.121 --> 02:33:18.022
MOTORISTS SOON WHO IS WE WE KNOW

02:33:18.088 --> 02:33:19.490
THE PERCENTAGES BUT WE DON'T

02:33:19.557 --> 02:33:21.659
KNOW WHY RIGHT EXACTLY THE

02:33:21.725 --> 02:33:22.293
UNDERLYING CAUSES.

02:33:22.359 --> 02:33:24.562
IS IT STILL A BIT OF A BLACK BOX

02:33:24.628 --> 02:33:25.763
AT LEAST IN OUR REVIEW OF THE

02:33:25.829 --> 02:33:26.664
DATA.

02:33:26.730 --> 02:33:29.567
PERHAPS YOU SEE WILL HAVE --

02:33:29.633 --> 02:33:31.902
SOME BETTER INFORMATION ON THAT

02:33:31.969 --> 02:33:33.704
AND HOW TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION

02:33:33.771 --> 02:33:35.205
DO YOU PROVIDE MORE FINANCIALLY

02:33:35.272 --> 02:33:36.907
DO YOU EXPAND FOOD AND HOUSING.

02:33:36.974 --> 02:33:38.542
AN INITIATIVE DO YOU PROVIDE

02:33:38.609 --> 02:33:39.743
FINANCIAL LITERACY COURSES ALL

02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:41.178
THESE ADDRESS KIND OF DIFFERENT

02:33:41.245 --> 02:33:42.846
CAUSES AND SO WITHOUT REALLY

02:33:42.913 --> 02:33:43.714
HAVING A FULLER PICTURE OF THAT

02:33:43.781 --> 02:33:45.282
IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE

02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:46.951
LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS --

02:33:47.017 --> 02:33:48.519
THAT DISCUSSION BETWEEN

02:33:48.586 --> 02:33:49.186
FINANCIAL AID AND FOOD AND

02:33:49.253 --> 02:33:50.654
HOUSING INITIATIVES ON THE

02:33:50.721 --> 02:33:52.456
CAMPUSES.

02:33:52.523 --> 02:33:54.658
THE SECOND ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS --

02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:56.393
KIND OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN

02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:57.027
FINANCIAL AID IN PUBLIC

02:33:57.094 --> 02:33:58.095
ASSISTANCE.

02:33:58.162 --> 02:33:59.496
USUALLY DOESN'T HAVE A

02:33:59.563 --> 02:34:01.665
COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON SOON

02:34:01.732 --> 02:34:03.267
PARTICIPATION IN CAL FRESH FOR

02:34:03.334 --> 02:34:04.868
EXAMPLE BUT SOME EVIDENCE

02:34:04.935 --> 02:34:06.270
SUGGESTS THAT THERE THERE COULD

02:34:06.337 --> 02:34:07.471
BE OTHER STUDENTS WHO COULD

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:08.939
BENEFIT FROM PUBLIC ASSISTANCE

02:34:09.006 --> 02:34:10.507
PROGRAMS AND ARE CURRENTLY DOING

02:34:10.574 --> 02:34:12.509
SO. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AND THE

02:34:12.576 --> 02:34:15.546
FIRST OF HALF OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:34:15.613 --> 02:34:16.146
YOU SEE REPORTS THAT IT AND

02:34:16.213 --> 02:34:17.581
ROLLED OVER TEN THOUSAND

02:34:17.648 --> 02:34:18.882
STUDENTS ON THE CAL FRESH.

02:34:18.949 --> 02:34:19.817
NOT SUGGEST THAT THERE THERE

02:34:19.883 --> 02:34:20.884
COULD HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT

02:34:20.951 --> 02:34:22.152
NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO MAYBE

02:34:22.219 --> 02:34:23.253
WEREN'T AWARE THAT THEY COULD

02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:24.755
ACCESS THOSE BENEFITS AND SO.

02:34:24.822 --> 02:34:25.889
GETTING MORE INFORMATION ON THAT

02:34:25.956 --> 02:34:26.890
COULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE

02:34:26.957 --> 02:34:28.826
ASSESS WHETHER IT SHOULD ADDRESS

02:34:28.892 --> 02:34:29.994
THESE ISSUES THROUGH FINANCIAL

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:32.963
LATER PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:34.031
OR SOME MIX OF THAT.

02:34:34.098 --> 02:34:34.832
THE THIRD ISSUE FOR THE

02:34:34.898 --> 02:34:36.000
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS

02:34:36.066 --> 02:34:37.334
INEQUITIES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:38.702
SEGMENTS --

02:34:38.769 --> 02:34:40.404
RIGHT NOW YOU SEE PROVIDES --

02:34:40.471 --> 02:34:42.539
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE AMOUNT OF AID

02:34:42.606 --> 02:34:44.408
FOR LIVING COSTS THAN US YES YOU

02:34:44.475 --> 02:34:46.410
IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:47.911
AND THAT MEANS THAT STUDENTS TO

02:34:47.978 --> 02:34:48.579
GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SEE

02:34:48.646 --> 02:34:50.347
IF YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BORROW MORE

02:34:50.414 --> 02:34:52.516
OR WORKING LONGER HOURS TO COVER

02:34:52.583 --> 02:34:53.584
COSTS.

02:34:53.651 --> 02:34:55.052
AND IN RECENT YEARS THE

02:34:55.119 --> 02:34:57.254
LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS

02:34:57.321 --> 02:34:59.056
THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO

02:34:59.123 --> 02:35:00.324
PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDS.

02:35:00.391 --> 02:35:01.258
FOR FOOD AND HOUSING AND

02:35:01.325 --> 02:35:03.193
SECURITY AT UC BUT ONE TIME

02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:04.595
FUNDS FOR C. AS YOU AND DOESN'T

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:06.196
HAVE AN ASSOCIATED PROPOSAL FOR

02:35:06.263 --> 02:35:09.066
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

02:35:09.133 --> 02:35:09.733
ALTHOUGH IT IS AS YOU'LL HEAR IN

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:10.801
A LATER SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING

02:35:10.868 --> 02:35:12.336
THERE IS A PROPOSAL --

02:35:12.403 --> 02:35:12.670
REGARDING --

02:35:12.736 --> 02:35:15.039
CAL GRANTS THAT LARGELY AFFECTS

02:35:15.105 --> 02:35:16.774
A PORTION OF STUDENTS AT

02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:18.308
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT THAT

02:35:18.375 --> 02:35:21.145
ADDRESS THE FUNDS MOVE GREATER

02:35:21.211 --> 02:35:21.745
LIVING COSTS THROUGH FINANCIAL

02:35:21.812 --> 02:35:22.146
AID.

02:35:22.212 --> 02:35:22.780
AND THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT

02:35:22.846 --> 02:35:23.580
TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT SHOULD

02:35:23.647 --> 02:35:25.282
PRIORITIZE ON GOING.

02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:25.849
WHERE THEY'RE?

02:35:25.916 --> 02:35:27.184
FINANCIALLY AS GREAT AS FOR

02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:28.218
EXAMPLE AT CSU AND COMMUNITY

02:35:28.285 --> 02:35:30.587
COLLEGES AND ONE WAY THE

02:35:30.654 --> 02:35:32.122
LEGISLATURE WHEN ONE TOOL JUST

02:35:32.189 --> 02:35:32.990
LIKE YOUR HOUSE IS AT ITS

02:35:33.057 --> 02:35:34.858
DISPOSABLE DISPOSAL FUSE ME.

02:35:34.925 --> 02:35:36.260
IS THE CAL GRANT BE AXIS AWARD

02:35:36.326 --> 02:35:37.594
WHICH COVERS LIVING COSTS

02:35:37.661 --> 02:35:39.663
PRIMARILY FOR STUDENTS AT CSUN

02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:41.398
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THERE'S

02:35:41.465 --> 02:35:42.633
SOME ISSUES TO CONSIDER IS

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:46.804
REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL.

02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:47.871
AND THEN OF COURSE.

02:35:47.938 --> 02:35:49.106
MY UNDERSTANDING IS IN AT THE

02:35:49.173 --> 02:35:49.740
COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL FOR FOR

02:35:49.807 --> 02:35:50.874
EXAMPLE IF YOUR OUT OF HIGH

02:35:50.941 --> 02:35:51.809
SCHOOL FOR A FEW YEARS YOU DON'T

02:35:51.875 --> 02:35:53.177
QUALIFY FOR THE KELLGREN

02:35:53.243 --> 02:35:54.778
ENTITLEMENT IN YOUR IN THE

02:35:54.845 --> 02:35:57.047
COMPETITIVE POOL IN THEIR THREE

02:35:57.114 --> 02:35:58.048
HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SO.

02:35:58.115 --> 02:36:01.885
APPLICANTS IN. TWENTY FIVE OR

02:36:01.952 --> 02:36:02.519
THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ACTUALLY

GET IT SO SUGGESTS THAT THERE

02:36:04.655 --> 02:36:07.291
ARE A COUPLE ON A COUPLE HUNDRED

02:36:07.357 --> 02:36:09.326
THOUSAND FOLKS IF THEY ALL GO.

02:36:09.393 --> 02:36:10.494
EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T GET

02:36:10.561 --> 02:36:12.062
KELLGREN ASSISTANTS WHO WERE

02:36:12.129 --> 02:36:13.697
FLOATING AROUND WITH IT WITHOUT

02:36:13.764 --> 02:36:14.798
ANY FINANCIAL AID.

02:36:14.865 --> 02:36:16.667
I GUESS.

02:36:16.734 --> 02:36:18.335
THAT THAT IS TRUE THAT --

02:36:18.402 --> 02:36:19.369
IF YOU WHICH IF YOU DON'T

02:36:19.436 --> 02:36:21.071
QUALIFY FOR AN ENTITLEMENT AND

02:36:21.138 --> 02:36:22.306
YOU HAVE TO YOU'RE SORT OF LEFT

IS A PROPOSAL TO TELL.

02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:27.578
EXPAND THAT A LIMIT OF THE

02:36:27.644 --> 02:36:29.012
GOVERNOR'S MAKING BUT YES --

02:36:29.079 --> 02:36:30.581
THERE MANY STUDENTS WHO DON'T

02:36:30.647 --> 02:36:33.150
QUALIFY FOR ENTITLEMENT ARE LEFT.

02:36:33.217 --> 02:36:34.518
TO WITH THOSE ARE LIMITED NUMBER

02:36:34.585 --> 02:36:37.521
OF COMPETITIVE WORDS WHICH

02:36:37.588 --> 02:36:38.822
UNDOUBTEDLY.

02:36:38.889 --> 02:36:43.026
CONTRIBUTES TO FOOD AND SECURITY.

02:36:43.093 --> 02:36:43.660
IF YOU THOUGHT OF FINANCIAL AID

02:36:43.727 --> 02:36:45.195
AND YOU NEED.

02:36:45.262 --> 02:36:46.530
OKAY THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE

02:36:46.597 --> 02:36:47.831
HOPEFULLY WE CAN DRILL DOWN AND

02:36:47.898 --> 02:36:50.100
GET SOME DATA AS TO WHY.

02:36:50.167 --> 02:36:51.702
I WAS SHOCKED BY THE NUMBERS

02:36:51.769 --> 02:36:54.271
ACTUALLY THE PERCENTAGES --

02:36:54.338 --> 02:36:55.606
OF THOSE STUDENTS EXPERIENCING

02:36:55.672 --> 02:36:58.275
FOOD IN SECURITY AND OF THE 26%

02:36:58.342 --> 02:36:59.543
OF FRESHMEN WITH FAMILY INCOMES

02:36:59.610 --> 02:37:00.711
ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:37:00.778 --> 02:37:02.045
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:37:02.112 --> 02:37:04.014
EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY

02:37:04.081 --> 02:37:05.749
REALLY SHOCKED ME SO.

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:06.850
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIND

02:37:06.917 --> 02:37:09.653
OUT WHY.

02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:10.387
YOU SEE.

02:37:10.454 --> 02:37:12.222
OF WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR

02:37:12.289 --> 02:37:14.358
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL --

02:37:14.424 --> 02:37:16.527
I WANTED TO GO LITTLE BIT OVER

02:37:16.593 --> 02:37:18.362
HOW WE CAME UP WITH THIS FIFTEEN

02:37:18.428 --> 02:37:19.630
MILLION DOLLAR.

02:37:19.696 --> 02:37:20.998
AMOUNT.

02:37:21.064 --> 02:37:25.302
IF WE HAD RAISED TUITION THE

02:37:25.369 --> 02:37:26.937
FIFTEEN MILLION IS THE AMOUNT OF

02:37:27.004 --> 02:37:28.238
WOULD HAVE GONE TO FINANCIAL AID

02:37:28.305 --> 02:37:29.773
OUT OF THAT AMOUNT SO THAT'S HOW

02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:32.276
WE CAME UP WITH THE NUMBER.

02:37:32.342 --> 02:37:33.310
FIFTEEN A MILLION AND YOU'LL

02:37:33.377 --> 02:37:34.645
HEAR PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS

02:37:34.711 --> 02:37:36.180
SOMETIMES A FINANCIAL AID

02:37:36.246 --> 02:37:37.147
PROPOSAL.

02:37:37.214 --> 02:37:38.782
SINCE WE SUBMIT THAT PROPOSAL

02:37:38.849 --> 02:37:41.919
THE GOVERNOR WE HAVE HEARD FROM

02:37:41.985 --> 02:37:43.520
MANY OF OUR STUDENTS AND THE ODD

02:37:43.587 --> 02:37:45.122
THE REGIONS HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED

02:37:45.189 --> 02:37:45.789
THIS.

02:37:45.856 --> 02:37:50.694
ITEM THIS AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND

02:37:50.761 --> 02:37:52.162
HAVE WANTED.

02:37:52.229 --> 02:37:52.796
TO HAVE IT AND HAVE IT INSTEAD

02:37:52.863 --> 02:37:54.731
BE DISTRIBUTED ON THE CAMPUSES

02:37:54.798 --> 02:37:57.067
AS DIRECT AID TO STUDENTS EITHER.

02:37:57.134 --> 02:38:00.070
AS EMERGENCY HOUSING ASSISTANCE

02:38:00.137 --> 02:38:02.372
OR FOOD BANKS STOCKING TO FOOD

02:38:02.439 --> 02:38:04.141
BANKS FOR THE CAMPUSES --

02:38:04.208 --> 02:38:05.275
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE

02:38:05.342 --> 02:38:07.177
STUDENTS WHO ARE REQUESTING --

02:38:07.244 --> 02:38:09.780
EMERGENCY AID RECEIVE IT AT THE

02:38:09.847 --> 02:38:11.248
MOMENT SO.

02:38:11.315 --> 02:38:12.816
THAT'S THE THAT'S DIRECTION

02:38:12.883 --> 02:38:18.355
WE'RE HEADED IN WITHTHOSE PLANS

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:19.323
A LIKE A GOOD PLAN --

02:38:19.389 --> 02:38:20.390
WE WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

02:38:20.457 --> 02:38:21.191
THE STUDENTS BENEFIT DIRECTLY

02:38:21.258 --> 02:38:22.960
FROM THESE FUNDS THAT'S WHAT THE

02:38:23.026 --> 02:38:25.662
UNIVERSITY ONCE --

02:38:25.729 --> 02:38:26.730
AS DEALIO --

02:38:26.797 --> 02:38:28.632
ALREADY REVIEWED IN TWENTY

02:38:28.699 --> 02:38:30.067
SIXTEEN WE HAD THIS STUDENT

02:38:30.133 --> 02:38:31.368
EXPERIENCE SURVEY THAT FOUND A

02:38:31.435 --> 02:38:32.836
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT.

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:37.407
OF STUDENT HUNGER WHERE FOR

02:38:37.474 --> 02:38:39.309
SYNDICATED OR SKIPPING A MEAL AT

02:38:39.376 --> 02:38:41.011
LEAST ONCE A MONTH SOME ANYMORE --

02:38:41.078 --> 02:38:42.346
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO

02:38:42.412 --> 02:38:43.447
PURCHASE FOOD.

02:38:43.513 --> 02:38:45.682
SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH --

02:38:45.749 --> 02:38:46.950
THE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID

02:38:47.017 --> 02:38:49.219
AVAILABLE WE HAVE YOU SEE HAS A

02:38:49.286 --> 02:38:51.121
VERY GENEROUS FINANCIAL AID

02:38:51.188 --> 02:38:52.022
PACKAGE WHERE FROM FOREST

02:38:52.089 --> 02:38:53.824
STUDENTS WE ALSO PROVIDE THEM

02:38:53.891 --> 02:38:56.960
WITH LIVING ALLOWANCE --

02:38:57.027 --> 02:38:59.630
LIVING ALONE LIVING AID.

02:38:59.696 --> 02:39:00.564
HOWEVER --

02:39:00.631 --> 02:39:01.965
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH MONEY TO GO

02:39:02.032 --> 02:39:04.534
AROUND SO --

02:39:04.601 --> 02:39:06.536
STUDENTS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO

02:39:06.603 --> 02:39:08.171
WORK OR BORROW.

02:39:08.238 --> 02:39:09.373
FOR AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND

02:39:09.439 --> 02:39:11.174
DOLLARS OF THEIR OWN EDUCATIONAL

02:39:11.241 --> 02:39:11.842
COSTS.

02:39:11.909 --> 02:39:14.411
AND THAT CREATES A BURDEN FOR

02:39:14.478 --> 02:39:15.712
SOME STUDENTS WHO.

02:39:15.779 --> 02:39:17.948
STRUGGLE WITH --

02:39:18.015 --> 02:39:21.151
BALANCING WORK AND SCHOOL AND

02:39:21.218 --> 02:39:23.253
WHO DON'T WANT TO BORROW SO SO

02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:25.422
WE DO KNOW WE DO KNOW THE BASIS

02:39:25.489 --> 02:39:26.990
FOR THE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE

02:39:27.057 --> 02:39:28.725
FOOD AND SECURITY IS LACK OF

02:39:28.792 --> 02:39:29.426
LACK OF MONEY.

02:39:29.493 --> 02:39:30.994
THAT'S WHAT THE STUDENTS

02:39:31.061 --> 02:39:32.562
INDICATED THEMSELVES YES.

02:39:32.629 --> 02:39:35.432
AND WHILE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:39:35.499 --> 02:39:36.433
THOUSAND DOLLARS N MANY PLACES

02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:38.101
WOULD SEEM LIKE EXTREMELY

02:39:38.168 --> 02:39:40.037
WEALTHY PARENTS.

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:41.905
IN CALIFORNIA AND MANY LIVING

02:39:41.972 --> 02:39:43.874
AREAS.

02:39:43.941 --> 02:39:45.842
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS ODD

02:39:45.909 --> 02:39:46.009
NOT.

02:39:46.076 --> 02:39:49.413
CONSIDERED CALLS WILL HAVE THEIR

02:39:49.479 --> 02:39:50.814
INCOME LOCKED UP IN PAYING OFF A

02:39:50.881 --> 02:39:51.848
MORTGAGE.

02:39:51.915 --> 02:39:54.985
AND THEN GIVING A CHILD THIRTY

02:39:55.052 --> 02:39:57.287
FOUR THOUSAND A YEAR TO GO TO UC

02:39:57.354 --> 02:39:58.021
THIRTY FOUR BEING --

02:39:58.088 --> 02:40:00.524
THE FEES AND LIVING COSTS TO

02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:01.491
GATHER.

02:40:01.558 --> 02:40:02.793
ODD THAT OUR PARENT OF WITH

02:40:02.859 --> 02:40:04.594
MAKING A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

02:40:04.661 --> 02:40:06.463
MAY BE ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE THEY

02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:08.131
MAY BE A LITTLE LATE ELIGIBLE

02:40:08.198 --> 02:40:09.066
FOR SOME OF THE MIDDLE CLASS

02:40:09.132 --> 02:40:10.367
SCHOLARSHIP AS WELL.

02:40:10.434 --> 02:40:12.069
WHICH WOULD ALLEVIATE THAT COST

02:40:12.135 --> 02:40:13.303
BUT THEY'RE STILL A SIGNIFICANT

02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:14.938
COST FOR THE FAMILY.

02:40:15.005 --> 02:40:16.206
AND SO PERHAPS THE STUDENT IS

02:40:16.273 --> 02:40:17.741
NOT WANTING TO ASK THEIR PARENTS

02:40:17.808 --> 02:40:19.743
FOR THE FULL AMOUNT IF THERE ARE

02:40:19.810 --> 02:40:20.911
OTHER THINGS GOING ON LIKE THE

02:40:20.978 --> 02:40:22.779
PARENTS ARE SUPPORTING MULTIPLE

02:40:22.846 --> 02:40:24.448
KIDS AT THE SAME TIME OR SO.

02:40:24.514 --> 02:40:25.615
SO ABSOLUTELY I WAS IN

02:40:25.682 --> 02:40:27.584
MINIMIZING THE ISSUE I THINK

02:40:27.651 --> 02:40:29.419
IT'S A VERY REAL ISSUE AND IT'S

02:40:29.486 --> 02:40:31.054
AN ISSUE WE NEED TO ADDRESS.

02:40:31.121 --> 02:40:32.189
SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY THAT THE

02:40:32.255 --> 02:40:33.357
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD PROVIDE

02:40:33.423 --> 02:40:35.292
US WITH FIFTEEN MILLION ON GOING

02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:39.229
TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS STUDENT

02:40:39.296 --> 02:40:41.164
BASIC NEEDS --

02:40:41.231 --> 02:40:42.799
WE ALL HAVE NOW TAKEN A LOT OF

02:40:42.866 --> 02:40:44.134
ACTIONS TO START ADDRESSING

02:40:44.201 --> 02:40:46.203
THESE ISSUES BUT THE ACTIONS

02:40:46.269 --> 02:40:47.537
HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN TAKEN WITH

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:49.206
ONE TIME FUNDS --

02:40:49.272 --> 02:40:51.108
THE PRESIDENT ALLOCATED ABOUT

02:40:51.174 --> 02:40:52.809
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SYSTEM WIDE

02:40:52.876 --> 02:40:54.111
STARTING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT

02:40:54.177 --> 02:40:55.112
THAT WAS ONE TIME MONEY THAT'S

02:40:55.178 --> 02:40:56.179
BEEN SPENT.

02:40:56.246 --> 02:40:57.681
AND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED US

02:40:57.748 --> 02:40:59.583
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:40:59.649 --> 02:41:00.951
WITH TWO POINT FIVE MILLION AND

02:41:01.018 --> 02:41:03.220
IN THE CURRENT YEAR EIGHTEEN

02:41:03.286 --> 02:41:03.854
NINETEEN WITH A ONE POINT FIVE

02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:04.588
MILLION.

02:41:04.654 --> 02:41:06.156
BUT THOSE HAVE BEEN ONE TIME

02:41:06.223 --> 02:41:09.459
FUNDS WE USE THEM TO BUY --

02:41:09.526 --> 02:41:11.628
FOOD BANKS ON CAMPUSES TO SET UP

02:41:11.695 --> 02:41:13.663
A STUDENT FOOD BANKS WE SET UP A

02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:15.532
PROCESS WHERE STUDENTS ARE WHO

02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:17.601
HAVE A MEAL PLAN CAN DONATE

02:41:17.667 --> 02:41:20.070
THEIR UNUSED MEALS. TO STUDENTS

02:41:20.137 --> 02:41:22.305
WHO EXPRESS NEED AND THE STUDENT

02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:24.641
WHO THEN CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR

02:41:24.708 --> 02:41:26.777
A MEAL JUST COASTER GOES TO THE

02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:29.813
CAFE AND ARE THE COSTS OF THE OF

02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:30.747
STUDENT --

02:41:30.814 --> 02:41:34.351
DORMITORY EATERY AND WITH THEIR

02:41:34.418 --> 02:41:37.154
VERIFIED PAPERWORK GTS GETS

02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:38.789
DOES FREE MEALS.

02:41:38.855 --> 02:41:39.423
IT'S AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM HOW'S

02:41:39.489 --> 02:41:40.924
THAT WORKING WE HAVE HAD --

02:41:40.991 --> 02:41:46.129
LAST YEAR FORTY THOUSAND MEALS

02:41:46.196 --> 02:41:46.963
WERE DONATED.

02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:48.165
SO THAT THAT'S HELPED.

02:41:48.231 --> 02:41:50.067
ALLEVIATE HUNGER TREMENDOUSLY.

02:41:50.133 --> 02:41:52.269
RESTORES MY FAITH IN.

02:41:52.335 --> 02:41:54.704
SOCIETY YES IT'S OUR STUDENTS

02:41:54.771 --> 02:41:56.907
ARE VERY IS ALIVE YES.

02:41:56.973 --> 02:41:58.642
YES EVEN AMONG OUR POOR STUDENTS

02:41:58.708 --> 02:41:59.943
WHO.

02:42:00.010 --> 02:42:01.244
WHO ARE STRUGGLING --

02:42:01.311 --> 02:42:02.846
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING OUT FOR

02:42:02.913 --> 02:42:05.482
EACH OTHER AND IT'S VERY

02:42:05.549 --> 02:42:06.817
ENCOURAGING --

02:42:06.883 --> 02:42:08.218
NOT ONLY ARE WE PLANNING ON

02:42:08.285 --> 02:42:10.220
ADDRESSING STUDENT HUNGER --

02:42:10.287 --> 02:42:11.755
BUT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO TACKLE

02:42:11.822 --> 02:42:13.523
STUDENT HOMELESSNESS

02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:15.592
DISTURBINGLY OUR STUDENT SURVEY

02:42:15.659 --> 02:42:17.928
FOUND A 5% OF STUDENTS SAID THAT

02:42:17.994 --> 02:42:19.296
THEY HAVE BEEN HOMELESS AT SOME

02:42:19.362 --> 02:42:20.597
POINT DURING THEIR UNDERGRADUATE

02:42:20.664 --> 02:42:21.598
TIMES.

02:42:21.665 --> 02:42:23.633
THAT'S A LOT OF STUDENTS 5% MAY

02:42:23.700 --> 02:42:25.268
NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT BUT WE HAVE.

02:42:25.335 --> 02:42:27.904
A TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND

02:42:27.971 --> 02:42:29.806
STUDENTS THE 5% OUT.

02:42:29.873 --> 02:42:31.942
DOESN'T UP BEING A LOT.

02:42:32.008 --> 02:42:35.112
AND WE HAVE A PLAN TO SOME

02:42:35.178 --> 02:42:36.546
SLIGHT THIRTY TWO YOU WILL SEE

02:42:36.613 --> 02:42:37.848
HOW MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

02:42:37.914 --> 02:42:39.950
HOUSED IN OUR DORMITORIES ON ON

02:42:40.016 --> 02:42:42.652
CAMPUS HOUSING --

02:42:42.719 --> 02:42:44.955
WHILE WE ARE HOUSING 37% OF OUR

02:42:45.021 --> 02:42:47.791
UNDERGRADUATES CURRENTLY WE ALSO --

02:42:47.858 --> 02:42:49.960
BEFORE FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:42:50.026 --> 02:42:51.528
THERE WERE THIRTEEN THOUSAND

02:42:51.595 --> 02:42:52.863
FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ON A WAIT

02:42:52.929 --> 02:42:54.498
LIST TO GET INTO A DORMITORY.

02:42:54.564 --> 02:42:56.233
THAT'S A LOT OF STUDENTS --

02:42:56.299 --> 02:42:57.534
SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:42:57.601 --> 02:42:59.603
FACT THAT THE COST OF LIVING

02:42:59.669 --> 02:43:01.104
NEAR MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES IS

02:43:01.171 --> 02:43:04.274
EXTREMELY HIGH. FOR EXAMPLE UCLA

02:43:04.341 --> 02:43:06.309
BORDERS ELLIS ANGELUS

02:43:06.376 --> 02:43:07.277
NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED BELLAIRE

02:43:07.344 --> 02:43:09.146
WHERE THE AVERAGE HOUSE PRICES

02:43:09.212 --> 02:43:11.214
THIRTY MILLION OF THOSE

02:43:11.281 --> 02:43:12.415
INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT LOOKING

02:43:12.482 --> 02:43:13.817
DIFFERENT A SPARE BEDROOM TO A

02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:16.052
UNIVERSITY STUDENT THAT

02:43:16.119 --> 02:43:19.222
RESTRICTS THE AVAILABLE FAR MORE

02:43:19.289 --> 02:43:22.225
EXPENSIVE FOR STUDENTS --

02:43:22.292 --> 02:43:24.094
ON SLIDE THIRTY THREE YOU WILL

02:43:24.161 --> 02:43:25.495
SEE OUR STUDENT HOUSING

02:43:25.562 --> 02:43:26.696
INITIATIVE.

02:43:26.763 --> 02:43:28.999
WHICH BY TWENTY THREE WE HAVE

02:43:29.065 --> 02:43:33.603
NOW EXPANDED AND BY. TWENTY

02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:34.804
TWENTY FIVE BETWEEN NOW AND SO

02:43:34.871 --> 02:43:37.340
BETWEEN FALL TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

02:43:37.407 --> 02:43:38.642
FALL.

02:43:38.708 --> 02:43:39.476
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE ARE

02:43:39.543 --> 02:43:41.278
PLANNING AND HAVE ALREADY

02:43:41.344 --> 02:43:42.879
CONSTRUCTED SOME BUT ARE

02:43:42.946 --> 02:43:45.382
PLANNING ON CONSTRUCTING THIRTY

02:43:45.448 --> 02:43:46.816
THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENT BEDS

02:43:46.883 --> 02:43:47.984
FOR OUR STUDENTS.

02:43:48.051 --> 02:43:49.953
SO THE LET THAT ENTIRE WAITLIST

02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:52.389
INTO STUDENT HOUSING AND THEN.

02:43:52.455 --> 02:43:53.890
MAKE CERTAIN THAT STUDENTS WHO

02:43:53.957 --> 02:43:56.059
ARE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM HAVE

02:43:56.126 --> 02:43:57.794
AFFORDABLE SAFE HOUSING WHERE

02:43:57.861 --> 02:44:00.697
THEY CAN LIVE WITH THEIR PEERS

02:44:00.764 --> 02:44:02.732
AND BE CLOSE TO THE LEARNING

02:44:02.799 --> 02:44:07.170
ENVIRONMENT [inaudible]

02:44:07.237 --> 02:44:09.039
SHOW.

02:44:09.105 --> 02:44:13.009
IS ACCESS TO STUDENT HOUSING.

02:44:13.076 --> 02:44:16.279
PRIOR BASED ON NEED.

02:44:16.346 --> 02:44:17.948
CURRENTLY I IT'S PRIORITIZED

02:44:18.014 --> 02:44:20.217
BASED ON FRESHMAN STATUS SO

02:44:20.283 --> 02:44:21.885
UNDERGRADUATES FRESHMAN GOT

02:44:21.952 --> 02:44:25.622
ACCESS FIRST AND SOFT MOORE'S.

02:44:25.689 --> 02:44:27.457
AND THAT BUT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT

02:44:27.524 --> 02:44:30.927
BASED ON NEED AS FAR AS I KNOW.

02:44:30.994 --> 02:44:32.362
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

02:44:32.429 --> 02:44:34.864
IF THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER AND

02:44:34.931 --> 02:44:38.168
SOME FOLKS MIGHT NEED.

02:44:38.235 --> 02:44:39.603
UNIVERSITY HOUSING MORE THAN

02:44:39.669 --> 02:44:41.504
OTHER FOLKS --

02:44:41.571 --> 02:44:46.843
BUT BUT WE ARE PLANNING ON

02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:48.478
EXPANDING CAPACITY DOUBLE ALSO

02:44:48.545 --> 02:44:50.380
PULL STUDENTS OUT OF THE NEARBY

02:44:50.447 --> 02:44:51.915
COMMUNITIES INTO THE STUDENT

02:44:51.982 --> 02:44:53.049
HOUSING --

02:44:53.116 --> 02:44:54.818
AND HOPEFULLY KEEP THE RENT

02:44:54.884 --> 02:44:56.386
PRICES FROM RISING TOO MUCH NEAR

02:44:56.453 --> 02:45:03.326
THE CAMPUS.

02:45:03.393 --> 02:45:06.329
I HAVE NO QUESTIONS THAT IS

02:45:06.396 --> 02:45:08.431
THAT'S THAT'S MY PRESENTATION ON

02:45:08.498 --> 02:45:10.267
BASICALLY.

02:45:10.333 --> 02:45:12.469
TALK ABOUT THE STUDENT MENTAL

02:45:12.535 --> 02:45:13.436
HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH IS

02:45:13.503 --> 02:45:14.571
ISSUE NUMBER.

02:45:14.638 --> 02:45:15.138
EIGHT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:45:15.205 --> 02:45:16.673
PROPOSES FIVE POINT THREE

02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:17.340
MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL

02:45:17.407 --> 02:45:17.841
FUND TO HIRE ADDITIONAL

02:45:17.907 --> 02:45:20.277
CLINICIANS TO CARE FOR STUDENTS

02:45:20.343 --> 02:45:21.311
WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AT THE

02:45:21.378 --> 02:45:21.845
UC -- THESE

02:45:21.911 --> 02:45:23.413
FUNDS WILL SUPPORT A LONG TERM

02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:25.782
USE INITIATIVE TO ACHIEVE

02:45:25.849 --> 02:45:26.750
RECOMMENDING STASHING MET

02:45:26.816 --> 02:45:28.385
RECOMMENDED STAFFING RATIOS AND

02:45:28.451 --> 02:45:33.423
DECREASE WAIT TIME PATIENCE.

02:45:33.490 --> 02:45:33.990
THIS IS AN ISSUE OUR OFFICES

02:45:34.057 --> 02:45:34.824
STILL REVEALING WE'RE WORKING

02:45:34.891 --> 02:45:36.693
WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO GET

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:39.029
BETTER DATA ON KIND OF WORKLOAD

02:45:39.095 --> 02:45:40.597
ESTIMATES THIS IS ULTIMATELY A

02:45:40.664 --> 02:45:41.464
STAFFING REQUEST WITH THE

02:45:41.531 --> 02:45:43.166
FUNDING WOULD BE USED FOR IS TO

02:45:43.233 --> 02:45:44.501
HIRE MORE STAFF COUNSELORS AND

02:45:44.567 --> 02:45:45.869
PSYCHOLOGIST SO WE'RE TRYING TO

02:45:45.935 --> 02:45:47.070
GET MORE INFORMATION BOTH.

02:45:47.137 --> 02:45:48.538
ON RISING DEMAND WHICH YOU SEE

02:45:48.605 --> 02:45:51.241
HAS PROVIDED SOME IN FOR

02:45:51.308 --> 02:45:54.044
EXISTING STAFFING CAPACITY --

02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:55.845
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HOW MUCH MORE

02:45:55.912 --> 02:45:56.646
STAFF WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH

02:45:56.713 --> 02:45:58.114
THE WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE

02:45:58.181 --> 02:46:00.116
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET --

02:46:00.183 --> 02:46:01.351
IN ADDITION THERE ARE TWO OTHER --

02:46:01.418 --> 02:46:03.019
ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION THAT

02:46:03.086 --> 02:46:04.421
THE COMMITTEE COULD CONSIDER --

02:46:04.487 --> 02:46:06.656
FIRST WORDS WERE STILL REVIEWING

02:46:06.723 --> 02:46:08.925
THIS OURSELVES BUT AT UC

02:46:08.992 --> 02:46:10.427
REQUIRES ALL STUDENTS AS A

02:46:10.493 --> 02:46:12.295
CONDITION OF RED REGISTERING TO

02:46:12.362 --> 02:46:14.064
HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND AS

02:46:14.130 --> 02:46:15.231
PART OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE

02:46:15.298 --> 02:46:16.633
TO ITS AND SUPPOSED TO COVER.

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.601
MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

02:46:18.668 --> 02:46:20.170
AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE

02:46:20.236 --> 02:46:21.171
STUDENTS --

02:46:21.237 --> 02:46:22.872
OF CAMPUS BASED FEES AND ALSO

02:46:22.939 --> 02:46:24.741
SYSTEM WIDE FEES TO COVER.

02:46:24.808 --> 02:46:28.511
ON CAMPUS HEALTH SERVICES AND

02:46:28.578 --> 02:46:29.746
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

02:46:29.813 --> 02:46:30.880
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE THE

02:46:30.947 --> 02:46:31.448
POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF

02:46:31.514 --> 02:46:33.616
NEGATIVES OF THIS APPROACH ON

02:46:33.683 --> 02:46:35.452
THE ONE HAND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT.

02:46:35.518 --> 02:46:35.952
BECAUSE DUNES ARE PAUL

02:46:36.019 --> 02:46:37.587
PURCHASING INSURANCE AND THEY'RE

02:46:37.654 --> 02:46:38.321
PAYING FOR FEES THERE COULD BE

02:46:38.388 --> 02:46:40.290
SOME DOUBLE CHARGING HERE ON THE

02:46:40.357 --> 02:46:41.624
OTHER HAND THE UNIVERSITY HAS

02:46:41.691 --> 02:46:43.326
SOME ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY IT.

02:46:43.393 --> 02:46:45.695
DOES IT THIS WAY FOR EXAMPLE IT

02:46:45.762 --> 02:46:47.630
ENTER STUDENT PRIVACY --

02:46:47.697 --> 02:46:48.264
IT BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND

02:46:48.331 --> 02:46:48.865
OF PREPAYING IT THROUGH THEIR

02:46:48.932 --> 02:46:50.066
FEES I DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH

02:46:50.133 --> 02:46:51.101
INSURANCE --

02:46:51.167 --> 02:46:53.670
ALSO THERE MIGHT BE SOME

02:46:53.737 --> 02:46:57.006
SERVICES THAT AREN'T COVERED.

02:46:57.073 --> 02:46:57.874
AND THEN THIRD --

02:46:57.941 --> 02:46:58.975
JUSTIN'S AS YOU HEARD OF BASIC

02:46:59.042 --> 02:47:01.044
NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

02:47:01.111 --> 02:47:02.345
THERE'S A AN EQUITY THERE

02:47:02.412 --> 02:47:03.713
BETWEEN YOU CCS YOUR COMMUNITY

02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:04.914
COLLEGES.

02:47:04.981 --> 02:47:05.849
I DON'T HAVE THE DATA IN FRONT

02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:07.083
OF ME UNFORTUNATELY BUT WE'RE

02:47:07.150 --> 02:47:08.718
HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT TO THE THE

02:47:08.785 --> 02:47:10.053
CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU DID

02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:10.987
SOME --

02:47:11.054 --> 02:47:12.055
ESTIMATE ACROSS THE THREE

02:47:12.122 --> 02:47:12.655
SEGMENTS.

02:47:12.722 --> 02:47:13.356
ON BUT USUALLY DOES HAVE A

02:47:13.423 --> 02:47:14.924
HIGHER COUNSELOR TO STUDENT

02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:15.592
RATIO THAN THE OTHER TWO

02:47:15.658 --> 02:47:17.160
SEGMENTS AND IT RAISES QUESTIONS

02:47:17.227 --> 02:47:18.895
AS TO WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE

02:47:18.962 --> 02:47:20.563
WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS

02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:21.598
FIRST ON KIND OF HOW MANY LIVES

02:47:21.664 --> 02:47:22.732
EQUITIES OR IF THERE'S A

02:47:22.799 --> 02:47:24.334
RATIONALE FOR EXAMPLE.

02:47:24.401 --> 02:47:26.169
YOU SEE CAMPUSES HAVE MORE.

02:47:26.236 --> 02:47:27.270
STUDENTS TO LIVE ON CAMPUS SO

02:47:27.337 --> 02:47:29.105
PERHAPS THERE'S A RATIONAL TO

02:47:29.172 --> 02:47:29.973
PROVIDE IT MORE IT YOU SEE THE

02:47:30.039 --> 02:47:31.674
NEWS USING COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE

02:47:31.741 --> 02:47:32.475
JUST RAISE IT AS AN ISSUE FOR

02:47:32.542 --> 02:47:33.410
YOU TO CONSIDER.

02:47:33.476 --> 02:47:37.914
WE'LL SEE ISSUE DOESN'T PROVIDE

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:38.481
THE EQUIVALENT OF SHIP

02:47:38.548 --> 02:47:38.782
[inaudible]

02:47:38.848 --> 02:47:40.150
EITHER.

02:47:40.216 --> 02:47:41.084
YES MY UNDERSTANDING I'M NOT I'M

02:47:41.151 --> 02:47:42.252
NOT AS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT --

02:47:42.318 --> 02:47:44.287
HEALTH INSURANCE IT'S YES YOU MY

02:47:44.354 --> 02:47:45.789
UNDERSTANDING IS AGED THE ISSUE

02:47:45.855 --> 02:47:47.791
DOES NOT PROVIDE A C. ISSUE --

02:47:47.857 --> 02:47:51.227
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AS YOU

02:47:51.294 --> 02:47:52.962
SEE DOES SO THAT'S THAT'S

02:47:53.029 --> 02:47:54.931
CERTAINLY ONE DIFFERENCE.

02:47:54.998 --> 02:47:55.598
WELL I'D BE INTERESTED IN I'D BE

02:47:55.665 --> 02:47:57.467
INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM YOU SEE

02:47:57.534 --> 02:47:58.368
ABOUT THIS --

02:47:58.435 --> 02:48:00.570
I ASSUME THE CAPS CENTERS DO NOT

02:48:00.637 --> 02:48:02.539
BILL AGAINST SHIP WHEN SERVICES

02:48:02.605 --> 02:48:05.175
ARE PROVIDED.

02:48:05.241 --> 02:48:07.777
UGH THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT THAT

02:48:07.844 --> 02:48:10.647
THE THAT STUDENT HEALTH

02:48:10.713 --> 02:48:12.882
INSURANCE IS NOT BILLED FOR THE

02:48:12.949 --> 02:48:16.686
OF REGULAR MENTAL HEALTH.

02:48:16.753 --> 02:48:18.888
OF THIS HAS TO DO A LOT WITH

02:48:18.955 --> 02:48:21.191
STUDENT PRIVACY CONCERNS --

02:48:21.257 --> 02:48:22.926
BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE INFORMED

02:48:22.992 --> 02:48:24.761
SOMETIMES WHEN --

02:48:24.828 --> 02:48:26.563
WHEN THERE IS SUCH BILLING

02:48:26.629 --> 02:48:28.097
AGAINST AN INSURANCE BUT IT HAS

02:48:28.164 --> 02:48:29.766
A LOT TO DO WITH THE KINDS OF

02:48:29.833 --> 02:48:31.668
SERVICES THAT ARE BUILD ARE NOT

02:48:31.734 --> 02:48:34.003
BILLABLE? TO INSURANCE OFTEN

02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:36.272
BECAUSE THEY ARE --

02:48:36.339 --> 02:48:38.374
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT --

02:48:38.441 --> 02:48:39.576
SIR THAT.

02:48:39.642 --> 02:48:42.145
ANGST RELATED TO BEING AWAY FROM

02:48:42.212 --> 02:48:43.379
PARENTS BEING IN A NEW

02:48:43.446 --> 02:48:44.647
ENVIRONMENT --

02:48:44.714 --> 02:48:46.683
THAT'S NOT USUALLY INSURANCE

02:48:46.749 --> 02:48:48.151
COVER FULL BECAUSE THE STUDENTS.

02:48:48.218 --> 02:48:49.419
ARE WHILE THEY MAY BE SEEKING

02:48:49.486 --> 02:48:50.653
MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING

02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:52.689
SERVICES OFTEN DON'T HAVE A

02:48:52.755 --> 02:48:54.123
DIAGNOSABLE DISORDER.

02:48:54.190 --> 02:48:56.593
SO IT CANNOT ALWAYS BE BUILT

02:48:56.659 --> 02:48:58.895
BACK TO INSURANCE --

02:48:58.962 --> 02:49:00.730
ALSO THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH

02:49:00.797 --> 02:49:03.233
IF WE STARTED BILLING FOR

02:49:03.299 --> 02:49:04.868
INSURANCE FOR THE REGULAR.

02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:07.270
OF MENTAL HEALTH OF COUNSELING

02:49:07.337 --> 02:49:08.505
VISITS.

02:49:08.571 --> 02:49:09.973
WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE MEDICARE

02:49:10.039 --> 02:49:11.674
ALL INSURANCE FOR THAT AS WELL

02:49:11.741 --> 02:49:12.909
AND IF WE DO THAT WE WOULD HAVE

02:49:12.976 --> 02:49:14.611
TO OPEN OUR STUDENT MENTAL

02:49:14.677 --> 02:49:16.045
HEALTH CLINICS.

02:49:16.112 --> 02:49:18.715
TO MEDIC CAL PATIENTS REGARDLESS

02:49:18.781 --> 02:49:20.049
OF THEIR STUDENT STATUS.

02:49:20.116 --> 02:49:21.150
AND WE WANT TO KEEP THOSE

02:49:21.217 --> 02:49:24.654
CLINICS FOR OUR STUDENTS ONLY --

02:49:24.721 --> 02:49:26.289
BUT I CAN LOOK INTO --

02:49:26.356 --> 02:49:28.892
INTO HOW WHICH DEVELOP OUR SHIP

02:49:28.958 --> 02:49:30.760
RATES WHETHER OR NOT.

02:49:30.827 --> 02:49:32.462
THERE IS ANY OVERLAP IN THAT.

02:49:32.529 --> 02:49:35.598
I HAVE NO CLUE IN THE QUESTION I

02:49:35.665 --> 02:49:37.500
THIS IS A VERY VERY --

02:49:37.567 --> 02:49:39.469
SERIOUS ISSUE SOME OF YOU MAY

02:49:39.536 --> 02:49:41.304
HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT IT AND

02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:44.374
IN CASE YOU TWELVE K..

02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:45.108
TWO FOURTEEN AND IT'S MY

02:49:45.174 --> 02:49:47.043
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STRESSORS

02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:49.279
OUR STUDENT POPULATION TODAY AT

02:49:49.345 --> 02:49:51.548
ALL LEVELS ARE.

02:49:51.614 --> 02:49:53.116
GREAT AND AND INCREASING --

02:49:53.182 --> 02:49:54.717
BY THE DAY IN THE MONTH SO WE

02:49:54.784 --> 02:49:55.919
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:49:55.985 --> 02:49:57.086
THE APPROPRIATE.

02:49:57.153 --> 02:49:59.122
A PROPERLY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS

02:49:59.188 --> 02:50:00.790
ON CAMPUS TO TRY TO HELP IN

02:50:00.857 --> 02:50:02.458
WHATEVER WAY WE WE CAN'T WHETHER

02:50:02.525 --> 02:50:05.595
IT'S ON THE CAP CENTERS OR

02:50:05.662 --> 02:50:06.162
THROUGH THE STUDENT HEALTH

02:50:06.229 --> 02:50:07.063
PROGRAM.

02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:09.265
AND WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING TODAY

02:50:09.332 --> 02:50:11.534
SERVICE ARE YOUR APPROVAL OF THE

02:50:11.601 --> 02:50:12.502
FIVE POINT THREE MILLION AN

02:50:12.569 --> 02:50:13.803
ONGOING FUNDING IN THE

02:50:13.870 --> 02:50:15.104
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

02:50:15.171 --> 02:50:17.540
BUT WE'RE ALSO REQUESTING --

02:50:17.607 --> 02:50:18.875
FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION IN ONE

02:50:18.942 --> 02:50:20.443
TIME FUNDING FROM CURRENT YEAR

02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:22.745
BE MADE PERMANENT ANOTHER STEP

02:50:22.812 --> 02:50:23.746
FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION AS PART

02:50:23.813 --> 02:50:25.248
OF THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION WE

02:50:25.315 --> 02:50:26.849
DISCUSSED EARLIER AT THE

02:50:26.916 --> 02:50:28.318
BEGINNING OF THIS HEARING.%

02:50:28.384 --> 02:50:30.353
SO WAS EMBEDDED IN THAT CURRENT

02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:32.589
YEAR ONE TIME FUNDS WE RECEIVED.

02:50:32.655 --> 02:50:33.323
THAT --

02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:38.394
WE'RE NOT RECEIVING AS AS AS CAN

02:50:38.461 --> 02:50:39.762
WE BE PROVIDED.

02:50:39.829 --> 02:50:41.698
THOSE FUNDS ARE CRITICAL FOR US

02:50:41.764 --> 02:50:43.066
TO CONTINUE OUR EMPLOYING THE

02:50:43.132 --> 02:50:44.500
MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS THAT WE

02:50:44.567 --> 02:50:46.035
HAVE ALREADY HIRED ON OUR

02:50:46.102 --> 02:50:47.770
CAMPUSES.

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:50.373
ON SLIDE THIRTY FIVE I HAVE SOME

02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:52.508
DATA ON HOW MANY STUDENTS HAVE

02:50:52.575 --> 02:50:53.843
BEEN REQUESTING --

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:55.678
APPOINTMENTS.

02:50:55.745 --> 02:50:58.648
AT AT OUR MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS

02:50:58.715 --> 02:51:00.316
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE OVER

ESTIMATES AS THE AND OR OR EVEN

02:59:09.038 --> 02:59:10.639
WHAT --

02:59:10.706 --> 02:59:12.174
CROSSES A SPECIAL FROM DEFERRED

02:59:12.241 --> 02:59:13.442
MAINTENANCE INTO CAPITAL OUTLAY.

02:59:13.509 --> 02:59:14.677
BUT WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE

02:59:14.743 --> 02:59:16.078
ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING

02:59:16.145 --> 02:59:17.313
TARGETED EFFORTS TO ADDRESS

02:59:17.379 --> 02:59:18.881
THESE DEPARTMENTS ONGOING

02:59:18.948 --> 02:59:21.250
FACILITY NEEDS BUT THIS GOAL OF

02:59:21.317 --> 02:59:22.084
PREVENTING AN INCREASE IN

02:59:22.151 --> 02:59:23.786
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE --

02:59:23.853 --> 02:59:25.921
BUT AS AS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE

02:59:25.988 --> 02:59:30.192
AND IT IS AN ALLIANCE WITH THE

02:59:30.259 --> 02:59:32.228
ADMINISTRATION'S PAL.

02:59:32.294 --> 02:59:33.996
IS BALANCING ONE TIME AN ONGOING

02:59:34.063 --> 02:59:35.631
NEEDS WELL IT OCCURS TO ME WE'RE

02:59:35.698 --> 02:59:36.432
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO I MEAN

02:59:36.499 --> 02:59:38.667
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS.

02:59:38.734 --> 02:59:39.268
SEEMS FINE TO ME WE NEED TO

02:59:39.335 --> 02:59:40.402
PROVIDE THE MONEY NECESSARY FOR

02:59:40.469 --> 02:59:41.303
THE INSTITUTION TO KEEP ITS

02:59:41.370 --> 02:59:44.240
FACILITIES --

02:59:44.306 --> 02:59:46.375
IN GOOD SHAPE.

02:59:46.442 --> 02:59:47.710
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A

02:59:47.776 --> 02:59:50.279
BROADER CONVERSATION ON HOW WE

02:59:50.346 --> 02:59:52.481
HOW WE FUND.

02:59:52.548 --> 02:59:54.617
THE THESE CAPITAL FOR DEFERRED

02:59:54.683 --> 02:59:55.384
MAINTENANCE PROJECTS

02:59:55.451 --> 02:59:57.253
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT

02:59:57.319 --> 02:59:59.388
THIS ONE'S FOUR POINT FOUR

02:59:59.455 --> 03:00:00.623
BILLION I THINK SEE ISSUE.

03:00:00.689 --> 03:00:01.924
THE ISSUE SYSTEM HAS SOMETHING

03:00:01.991 --> 03:00:03.692
SIMILAR SOMETHING AROUND FOUR

03:00:03.759 --> 03:00:06.328
BILLION DOLLARS IN NEEDS --

03:00:06.395 --> 03:00:08.964
SO THE TOTAL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

03:00:09.031 --> 03:00:11.901
EIGHT AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS --

03:00:11.967 --> 03:00:14.136
AND IT'S NOT GOING DOWN ON ITS

03:00:14.203 --> 03:00:15.771
OWN ACCORD.

03:00:15.838 --> 03:00:17.106
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A

03:00:17.173 --> 03:00:18.641
LARGER CONVERSATION HOW WE

03:00:18.707 --> 03:00:22.077
POSSIBLY AS A STATE CAN CAN FUND.

03:00:22.144 --> 03:00:23.812
THESE PROJECTS ON SOME REGULAR

03:00:23.879 --> 03:00:25.714
RECURRING BASIS SO WE WHITTLE

03:00:25.781 --> 03:00:28.184
THAT. NINE BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL

03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:29.652
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

03:00:29.718 --> 03:00:34.023
DOWN OVER TIME I THINK THE WAY.

03:00:34.089 --> 03:00:35.691
YEAH I'M I'M IS CERTAINLY A GOAL

03:00:35.758 --> 03:00:37.226
IT WOULD JUST HAVE TO BE WEIGHED

03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:38.694
IN TOO WITH ALL THE OTHER

03:00:38.761 --> 03:00:41.397

WE GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS.

03:00:50.306 --> 03:00:51.974
THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM AND

03:00:52.041 --> 03:00:53.075
BEGIN.

03:00:53.142 --> 03:00:55.177

MEANINGFUL WAY INSTEAD OF

03:00:57.479 --> 03:01:01.250
INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED MILLION

03:01:01.317 --> 03:01:03.686
THERE WHEN THE THE WOMEN NOT TO

WHEN THIS ITEM THE FIRST AS DEBT

03:01:22.204 --> 03:01:24.340
SERVICE COSTS THE SECOND IS --

03:01:24.406 --> 03:01:25.341
PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION AND

03:01:25.407 --> 03:01:28.777
RENOVATION PROJECTS AND TWENTY

03:01:28.844 --> 03:01:29.345
NINETEEN TWENTY AND IN THE

03:01:29.411 --> 03:01:30.112
THIRTIES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:01:30.179 --> 03:01:31.513
SOLVED ADDRESS EACH ISSUE ONE AT

03:01:31.580 --> 03:01:32.047
A TIME.

03:01:32.114 --> 03:01:33.515
REGARDING DEBT SERVICE COSTS

03:01:33.582 --> 03:01:35.050
VERY QUICKLY YOU SEE DEBT

03:01:35.117 --> 03:01:35.985
SERVICE COSTS ARE ANTICIPATED

03:01:36.051 --> 03:01:37.419
TURN INCREASED BY ABOUT FIFTEEN

03:01:37.486 --> 03:01:40.522
MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY

03:01:40.589 --> 03:01:41.123
NINETEEN TWENTY AND THESE ARE

03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.724
THIS DEBT SERVICE ASSOCIATED

03:01:41.790 --> 03:01:44.026
WITH PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED

03:01:44.093 --> 03:01:46.762
IN IN PREVIOUS YEARS BUT YOU SEE

03:01:46.829 --> 03:01:48.564
IS NOW BEGINNING TO FINANCE THEM --

03:01:48.631 --> 03:01:50.065
AND SO THIS IS A COST IT'S NOT

03:01:50.132 --> 03:01:51.033
IDENTIFIED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

03:01:51.100 --> 03:01:52.801
BUDGET AND IT MAY BE A COST THAT

03:01:52.868 --> 03:01:54.770
THE LEGISLATURE WANTS --

03:01:54.837 --> 03:01:55.938
TO FACTOR INTO ITS BUDGETS FINAL

03:01:56.005 --> 03:01:56.872
BUDGET DECISIONS FOR THE

03:01:56.939 --> 03:02:00.175
UNIVERSITY WHY DID WE CAP AT 15%

03:02:00.242 --> 03:02:03.946
CAN YOU REFRESH ME --

03:02:04.013 --> 03:02:05.648
ALSO THE ENGINE AND MAY I JUST

03:02:05.714 --> 03:02:06.782
MAKE SURE I DIDN'T MISS SPEAK

03:02:06.849 --> 03:02:08.517
THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS A

03:02:08.584 --> 03:02:10.152
JUST A INCREASE IN THE COST BUT

03:02:10.219 --> 03:02:11.720
YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE 15% SO

03:02:11.787 --> 03:02:13.255
WE KEPT THERE YEAH.

03:02:13.322 --> 03:02:14.923
OKAY JUST MAKE SURE MAKING

03:02:14.990 --> 03:02:17.192
JORDAN TO SPEAK ON THAT --

03:02:17.259 --> 03:02:17.726
BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE THE

03:02:17.793 --> 03:02:19.094
NUMBER FIFTEEN AND THEN --

03:02:19.161 --> 03:02:20.262
YOU WOULD BE ME WHO IT WOULD

03:02:20.329 --> 03:02:20.863
MISSPOKE YEAH SO THE THE IDEA

03:02:20.929 --> 03:02:22.464
BEHIND AND I DON'T HAVE

03:02:22.531 --> 03:02:25.034
INFORMATION AS TO WHY EXACTLY

03:02:25.100 --> 03:02:32.408
15% IT'S A IT'S A A 12% AT C. S.

03:02:32.474 --> 03:02:33.642
U. 15% IT YOU SEE SO IT'S A

03:02:33.709 --> 03:02:35.711
DIFFERENT PERCENTAGE SEGMENT --

03:02:35.778 --> 03:02:37.046
WHAT I WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT --

03:02:37.112 --> 03:02:37.680
IT IN FACTORING IN ROLLING IN

03:02:37.746 --> 03:02:38.547
DEBT SERVICE COSTS TO THE

03:02:38.614 --> 03:02:39.548
UNIVERSITY SUPPORT BUDGET --

03:02:39.615 --> 03:02:41.483
THE IDEA WAS THAT TH UNIVERSITY

03:02:41.550 --> 03:02:42.651
WOULD HAVE TWO WAY TRADE OFF

03:02:42.718 --> 03:02:44.086
EACH YEAR BETWEEN.

03:02:44.153 --> 03:02:45.487
A REGULARS ARE OPERATING COSTS

03:02:45.554 --> 03:02:48.991
AND ROMAN I CAPITAL OUTLAY AND

03:02:49.058 --> 03:02:51.593
SO THAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT WAS.

03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:52.328
TO PROVIDE A GREATER INCENTIVE

03:02:52.394 --> 03:02:54.797
FOR THAT THE CAP IS INTENDED I

03:02:54.863 --> 03:02:55.731
THINK.

03:02:55.798 --> 03:02:58.167
TO PROTECT --

03:02:58.233 --> 03:02:59.902
THE RECORD RAIN REMAINING

03:02:59.968 --> 03:03:01.070
PRIORITIES AND USE HIS BUDGET SO

03:03:01.136 --> 03:03:02.137
IT TO ENSURE IT DOESN'T GO ABOVE

03:03:02.204 --> 03:03:03.872
THAT PERCENT AND IT TAKES AWAY

03:03:03.939 --> 03:03:05.407
RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE MOMENT

03:03:05.474 --> 03:03:07.543
GROWTH OR COMPENSATION COSTS OR

03:03:07.609 --> 03:03:08.210
OTHER SORT OF OPERATING

03:03:08.277 --> 03:03:09.745
PRIORITIES I THINK THAT WAS THE

03:03:09.812 --> 03:03:10.612
INTENTION BEHIND THAT CAP BUT

03:03:10.679 --> 03:03:12.014
AGAIN I DON'T.

03:03:12.081 --> 03:03:12.781
HAVE ANY INFORMATION AS TO WHY

03:03:12.848 --> 03:03:15.851
THE C. LANDED ON THAT EXACT

03:03:15.918 --> 03:03:16.385
PERCENT [inaudible]

03:03:16.452 --> 03:03:17.553
THANK YOU.

03:03:17.619 --> 03:03:18.554
THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE THE

03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:20.255
SECOND ISSUE IS THE PROPOSED

03:03:20.322 --> 03:03:21.990
PROJECTS FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND

03:03:22.057 --> 03:03:23.392
YOU CAN SEE THOSE PROJECTS ON

03:03:23.459 --> 03:03:26.762
PAGE FORTY OF YOUR AGENDA.

03:03:26.829 --> 03:03:28.030
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE IS A

03:03:28.097 --> 03:03:29.164
THE FIRST ITEM THERE'S DEFERRED

03:03:29.231 --> 03:03:31.266
MAINTENANCE I'M GONNA SAVE THAT

03:03:31.333 --> 03:03:32.267
FOR THE THIRD.

03:03:32.334 --> 03:03:33.836
ISSUE THAT I RAISE SO THAT KEEP

03:03:33.902 --> 03:03:35.070
THE REMAINING SIX ARE IN OUR

03:03:35.137 --> 03:03:36.338
PROJECTS THEY GO TO CONSTRUCT

03:03:36.405 --> 03:03:37.840
NEW PROJECTS ON THE OR THE

03:03:37.906 --> 03:03:38.874
RENOVATION PROJECTS.

03:03:38.941 --> 03:03:40.976
AND WE RAISED ISSUES WITH WITH

03:03:41.043 --> 03:03:42.611
THE TWO OF THE PROJECTS --

03:03:42.678 --> 03:03:44.680
AT SANTA BARBARA AND SANTA CRUZ

03:03:44.747 --> 03:03:47.015
THEY'RE BOTH PROJECTS BROADLY --

03:03:47.082 --> 03:03:47.583
THEY'RE INTENDED THEIR THEIR

03:03:47.649 --> 03:03:48.717
INTENTION IS TO ADD MORE --

03:03:48.784 --> 03:03:50.719
CLASSROOM SPACE ACROSS THE

03:03:50.786 --> 03:03:51.387
CAMPUSES.

03:03:51.453 --> 03:03:54.456
A NEW BUILDINGS --

03:03:54.523 --> 03:03:55.691
WE HAVE SOME PROJECT LEVEL

03:03:55.758 --> 03:03:56.959
CONCERNS AS WELL BUT ARC ARE

03:03:57.025 --> 03:03:58.127
CROSS CUTTING CONCERN WITH BOTH

03:03:58.193 --> 03:03:59.528
PROJECTS IS THAT THEY FOCUS

03:03:59.595 --> 03:04:02.264
HEAVILY ON LARGE LECTURE SPACE

03:04:02.331 --> 03:04:02.865
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IF

03:04:02.931 --> 03:04:05.167
YOU LOOK AT CLASSROOM USE THAT

03:04:05.234 --> 03:04:06.168
YOU SEE AT THAT.

03:04:06.235 --> 03:04:08.437
VIRTUALLY ALL CAMPUSES --

03:04:08.504 --> 03:04:10.873
LARD LARGE LECTURE SPACE IS.

03:04:10.939 --> 03:04:12.307
IT USED MUCH MORE THAN SMALL

03:04:12.374 --> 03:04:12.908
CLASSROOM SPACE FOR EXAMPLE ON

03:04:12.975 --> 03:04:14.710
THAT.

03:04:14.777 --> 03:04:15.911
LINES OF OTHER INFORMATION YOU

03:04:15.978 --> 03:04:16.879
FOR TODAY FOR EXAMPLE --

03:04:16.945 --> 03:04:18.814
INCREASING CLASS SIZES FOR

03:04:18.881 --> 03:04:20.482
EXAMPLE THAT'S THAT'S FOR MANY

03:04:20.549 --> 03:04:21.083
YEARS HOW YOU SEE IS DELIVERED

03:04:21.150 --> 03:04:25.154
UNDER LARGE LECTURES STUDENTS

03:04:25.220 --> 03:04:26.422
ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

03:04:26.488 --> 03:04:29.057
STUDENTS IN A CLASS.

03:04:29.124 --> 03:04:30.392
OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE

03:04:30.459 --> 03:04:31.260
STATE IN RECENT YEARS HAS

03:04:31.326 --> 03:04:33.162
PROVIDED ONGOING FUNDING TO

03:04:33.228 --> 03:04:34.663
EXPAND ONLINE EDUCATION.

03:04:34.730 --> 03:04:36.365
AND YOU SEE NOTED THAT THERE IS --

03:04:36.432 --> 03:04:38.167
SOME POLICY DEBATE BETWEEN THE

03:04:38.233 --> 03:04:41.303
MERITS OF ONLINE VERSES IN FACE

03:04:41.370 --> 03:04:42.638
TO FACE INSTRUCTION IN OUR VIEW

03:04:42.704 --> 03:04:45.340
OF THE THAT DEBATE PROBABLY

03:04:45.407 --> 03:04:46.141
MAKES LESS SENSE ONCE THE CLASS

03:04:46.208 --> 03:04:47.843
I STARTS HITTING A HUNDRED FIFTY

03:04:47.910 --> 03:04:48.644
STUDENTS --

03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:50.679
IS PROBABLY NOT THE SAME LEVEL

03:04:50.746 --> 03:04:52.614
OF PERSONAL CONNECTION AS AS

03:04:52.681 --> 03:04:54.249
OPPOSED TO SAY --

03:04:54.316 --> 03:04:55.684
A CLASS THAT HAS MAYBE FORTY

03:04:55.751 --> 03:04:59.221
STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE.

03:04:59.288 --> 03:05:00.889
AND GIVEN THAT THE STATE IS.

03:05:00.956 --> 03:05:01.457
PROVIDING FUNDING TO EXPAND

03:05:01.523 --> 03:05:02.758
ONLINE EDUCATION.

03:05:02.825 --> 03:05:04.293
ARE WE RAISE THE CONCERN THAT

03:05:04.359 --> 03:05:04.893
WHETHER YOU SEE IS ADEQUATELY

03:05:04.960 --> 03:05:08.130
USING ONLINE EDUCATION. TO A

03:05:08.197 --> 03:05:09.498
KIND OF MEAT AND ROMAN DEMAND AN

03:05:09.565 --> 03:05:10.732
END USER TO HAVE AS AN

03:05:10.799 --> 03:05:12.234
ALTERNATIVE TO NEW CAMPUS

03:05:12.301 --> 03:05:13.969
CONTINUED --

03:05:14.036 --> 03:05:15.370
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION.

03:05:15.437 --> 03:05:16.438
AND ONE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT

03:05:16.505 --> 03:05:16.972
THE LEGISLATURE HAS MANY

03:05:17.039 --> 03:05:19.508
FACILITY OF PRIORITIES INCLUDING

03:05:19.575 --> 03:05:20.309
AS YOU NOTED DEFERRED

03:05:20.375 --> 03:05:21.743
MAINTENANCE LIFE SAFETY OF

03:05:21.810 --> 03:05:22.911
PROJECTS.

03:05:22.978 --> 03:05:24.546
AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY

03:05:24.613 --> 03:05:25.414
WE QUESTION WHETHER THE

03:05:25.481 --> 03:05:26.982
UNIVERSITY COULD DO MORE TO FIND

03:05:27.049 --> 03:05:28.951
ALTERNATIVES TO ACCOMMODATE

03:05:29.017 --> 03:05:30.719
ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND TO EASE --

03:05:30.786 --> 03:05:32.154
CAPACITY ISSUES IN LARGE LECTURE

03:05:32.221 --> 03:05:34.156
HALLS THAT'S OUR CONCERN THERE

03:05:34.223 --> 03:05:35.657
WELL IT YOU KNOW FROM MY

03:05:35.724 --> 03:05:39.895
PERSPECTIVE I I I I DO ENCOURAGE.

03:05:39.962 --> 03:05:41.263
IN THINK OUR UNIVERSITIES SHOULD

03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:42.931
LOOK AT ONLINE EDUCATION

03:05:42.998 --> 03:05:43.999
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF ISSUES

03:05:44.066 --> 03:05:45.334
DUKE'S SYSTEMS DOING THAT I

03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:46.869
THINK WE SHOULD.

03:05:46.935 --> 03:05:49.071
UTILIZE MORE ONLINE EDUCATION

03:05:49.137 --> 03:05:50.739
WERE APPROPRIATE CERTAINLY

03:05:50.806 --> 03:05:51.840
TAKING A LOOK AT THAT FOR

03:05:51.907 --> 03:05:53.208
BOTTLENECK COURSES AS WE

03:05:53.275 --> 03:05:54.710
DISCUSSED EARLIER.

03:05:54.776 --> 03:05:57.212
BUT I ALSO THINK IT SHOULD BE AN

03:05:57.279 --> 03:05:59.715
OPTION --

03:05:59.781 --> 03:06:01.083
FOR THE STUDENTS BECAUSE SOME

03:06:01.149 --> 03:06:02.351
STUDENTS ARE NOT GOING TO

03:06:02.417 --> 03:06:03.852
FUNCTION VERY WELL ON THE ONLINE

03:06:03.919 --> 03:06:05.587
ENVIRONMENT AND SOME.

03:06:05.654 --> 03:06:07.122
SOME WILL AND I JUST WONDER

03:06:07.189 --> 03:06:09.291
ADDING A LARGE LECTURE HALL FOR

03:06:09.358 --> 03:06:10.826
EXAMPLE THEY'RE PROBABLY MORE

03:06:10.893 --> 03:06:12.294
THAN ENOUGH STUDENTS.

03:06:12.361 --> 03:06:14.062
TO FILL THAT WHO WOULD OPT OUT

03:06:14.129 --> 03:06:16.698
OF ONLINE EDUCATION THAT WOULD

03:06:16.765 --> 03:06:18.700
YOU KNOW BE MY RESPONSE BUT I

03:06:18.767 --> 03:06:19.902
GUESS WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

03:06:19.968 --> 03:06:20.202
[inaudible]

03:06:20.269 --> 03:06:22.237
OKAY.

03:06:22.304 --> 03:06:24.172
ON AND THEN THE THE THIRD

03:06:24.239 --> 03:06:25.774
CONCERN A THIRD ISSUE WAS

03:06:25.841 --> 03:06:27.676
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND EGGS AT

03:06:27.743 --> 03:06:28.210
THIS IS A LITTLE CONFUSING

03:06:28.277 --> 03:06:29.378
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN TWO DIFFERENT

03:06:29.444 --> 03:06:30.546
AREAS BUT YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

03:06:30.612 --> 03:06:31.813
MEANINGS PROPOSALS.

03:06:31.880 --> 03:06:33.482
THE FIRST IS A HUNDRED AND

03:06:33.549 --> 03:06:34.049
THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS

03:06:34.116 --> 03:06:36.251
GENERAL FUND A ONE TIME GENERAL

03:06:36.318 --> 03:06:37.586
FUND FOR DEFERMENTS PROJECTS.

03:06:37.653 --> 03:06:40.889
AND THEN SECONDLY THE UNIVERSITY --

03:06:40.956 --> 03:06:42.624
IS ALSO PROPOSING A THIRTY FIVE

03:06:42.691 --> 03:06:44.126
MILLION DOLLARS IN BOND FUNDS

03:06:44.192 --> 03:06:44.826
FOR ADDITIONAL DEFERRED

03:06:44.893 --> 03:06:46.295
MAINTENANCE PROJECTS OF BOTH OF

03:06:46.361 --> 03:06:47.629
THOSE COMBINED OUR OUR IS WHAT'S

03:06:47.696 --> 03:06:49.298
BEFORE YOU IN TERMS OF DEFERRED

03:06:49.364 --> 03:06:52.100
MAINTENANCE PROPOSALS.

03:06:52.167 --> 03:06:53.669
WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THIS

03:06:53.735 --> 03:06:54.970
INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITIONS

03:06:55.037 --> 03:06:57.306
ASSESSMENT AND I'LL GET TO THAT

03:06:57.372 --> 03:06:58.240
IN MY TESTIMONY?

03:06:58.307 --> 03:06:59.274
A TOP I'LL BE SURETO TOUCH ON

03:06:59.341 --> 03:07:00.976
THAT -- AND

03:07:01.043 --> 03:07:03.946
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I SHOULD

03:07:04.012 --> 03:07:04.546
ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION

03:07:04.613 --> 03:07:07.316
NOW TO FIND THAT OUT OF THE BOND

03:07:07.382 --> 03:07:08.984
FUND SO THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION

03:07:09.051 --> 03:07:10.552
FIVE OF THAT WOULD GO FOR THE

03:07:10.619 --> 03:07:11.053
INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITION

03:07:11.119 --> 03:07:11.920
ASSESSMENT.

03:07:11.987 --> 03:07:13.121
THE REMAINING THIRTY WOULD BE

03:07:13.188 --> 03:07:14.323
FOR PROJECTS.

03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:17.626
IS THAT NORMAL.

03:07:17.693 --> 03:07:18.260
WHAT WE WRITE WE RAISE CONCERN

03:07:18.327 --> 03:07:19.795
WITH THAT WE THINK THAT'S AN

03:07:19.861 --> 03:07:21.530
INAPPROPRIATE USE OF BOND FUNDS

03:07:21.597 --> 03:07:22.464
THE BOND FUNDS CARRY THE COST OF

03:07:22.531 --> 03:07:23.198
A?

03:07:23.265 --> 03:07:25.534
PROJECT OVER MANY YEARS THIS

03:07:25.601 --> 03:07:26.868
WOULD BE A ONE TIME STUDY.

03:07:26.935 --> 03:07:28.403
I WILL NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY

03:07:28.470 --> 03:07:30.172
IS CURRENTLY DOING A FACILITY

03:07:30.238 --> 03:07:31.440
CONDITION ASSESSMENT THIS IS

03:07:31.506 --> 03:07:33.542
ASSESSING THE CONDITION OF ITS

03:07:33.609 --> 03:07:35.043
EXISTING FACILITIES AND SO YOU

03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:36.211
KNOW TO THE FOUR POINT FOUR

03:07:36.278 --> 03:07:37.145
BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED

03:07:37.212 --> 03:07:38.814
MAINTENANCE BACKLOG.

03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:39.848
OF THE UNIVERSITY --

03:07:39.915 --> 03:07:41.316
IS HOPING TO GET A MORE REFINED

03:07:41.383 --> 03:07:43.151
ESTIMATE FROM THE STUDY IT USED

03:07:43.218 --> 03:07:44.920
BOND FUNDS FOR THAT STUDY RAISE

03:07:44.987 --> 03:07:46.622
THE SAME CONCERNS NONE THE LESS

03:07:46.688 --> 03:07:47.689
OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED A

03:07:47.756 --> 03:07:49.625
UP A FORTY FOR THAT AND SO YOU

03:07:49.691 --> 03:07:51.493
KNOW DO YOU SEE WHAT I HAD AND

03:07:51.560 --> 03:07:52.561
FUNDED THAT'S THEIR BOND FUNDS.

03:07:52.628 --> 03:07:54.129
SO THEY THEY'VE DONE THAT IN THE

03:07:54.196 --> 03:07:55.263
IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR WE WE WE

03:07:55.330 --> 03:07:56.765
RAISE THE SAME CONCERNS WITH THE

03:07:56.832 --> 03:07:58.133
INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITION

03:07:58.200 --> 03:07:59.334
ASSESSMENT AND AND JUST TO

03:07:59.401 --> 03:08:00.569
SPECIFY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

03:08:00.636 --> 03:08:01.236
CONDITION ASSESSMENT IT'S

03:08:01.303 --> 03:08:02.838
LOOKING AT ROADWAYS UTILITIES

03:08:02.904 --> 03:08:04.439
OTHER THINGS THAT THAT ARE

03:08:04.506 --> 03:08:05.540
SEPARATE ROM THE FACILITIES AND

03:08:05.607 --> 03:08:06.675
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

03:08:06.742 --> 03:08:10.712
THOSE TWO STUDIES FOR THE FIVE

03:08:10.779 --> 03:08:14.116
MILLION.

03:08:14.182 --> 03:08:15.717
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I CAN GET

03:08:15.784 --> 03:08:17.486
I CAN GET BACK TO THEY THEY GAVE

03:08:17.552 --> 03:08:18.387
US A OF AN ESTIMATE OF DEBT

03:08:18.453 --> 03:08:19.388
SERVICE COSTS I DON'T HAVE IT IN

03:08:19.454 --> 03:08:20.555
FRONT OF ME BUT THEY THEY DID

03:08:20.622 --> 03:08:21.823
INCLUDE THE COST OF INTEREST I

03:08:21.890 --> 03:08:23.091
CAN I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON

03:08:23.158 --> 03:08:23.291
THAT.

03:08:23.358 --> 03:08:24.660
BUT THERE IS A COST OF INTEREST

03:08:24.726 --> 03:08:26.028
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

03:08:26.094 --> 03:08:27.095
I MEAN I THINK THIS IS WE NEED

03:08:27.162 --> 03:08:28.230
TO STUDY I MEAN I THINK THE

03:08:28.296 --> 03:08:29.931
STUDY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL I'M

03:08:29.998 --> 03:08:32.167
JUST WONDERING WHY WE DON'T FIND

03:08:32.234 --> 03:08:32.434
IT -- THE

03:08:32.501 --> 03:08:33.435
GENERAL FUND.

03:08:33.502 --> 03:08:35.570
IN AND PRESERVE.

03:08:35.637 --> 03:08:37.639
THAT SMALL RELATIVELY SMALL

03:08:37.706 --> 03:08:38.607
PIECE OF YOU SEES BONDING

03:08:38.674 --> 03:08:40.509
CAPACITY ANOTHER ISSUE TO

03:08:40.575 --> 03:08:42.010
CONSIDER IS THAT THIS IS --

03:08:42.077 --> 03:08:43.645
ONE TIME FUNDING LONG TERM YOU

03:08:43.712 --> 03:08:44.746
SEE WILL LIKELY HAVE TO

03:08:44.813 --> 03:08:46.281
OPERATIONALIZE THE STUDIES TO

03:08:46.348 --> 03:08:48.183
CONTINUE TO KEEP THAT ESTIMATE

03:08:48.250 --> 03:08:49.584
RELEVANT IN FUTURE YEARS.

03:08:49.651 --> 03:08:50.852
AND IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE

03:08:50.919 --> 03:08:52.554
QUESTION OF HOW YOU CIVIL --

03:08:52.621 --> 03:08:54.756
FUNDED IN AN ONGOING BASIS ONCE

03:08:54.823 --> 03:08:57.325
THE INITIAL STUDIES COMPLETED.

03:08:57.392 --> 03:08:59.161
NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE BUDGET.

03:08:59.227 --> 03:08:59.861
RIGHT UP IN THAT THAT'S ONE

03:08:59.928 --> 03:09:02.764
OPTION YES.

03:09:02.831 --> 03:09:05.167
BUT A MINIATURE OF TRUCK NOT

03:09:05.233 --> 03:09:06.134
SURE --

03:09:06.201 --> 03:09:06.768
SOMEONE THING WE WE NOTED WITH

03:09:06.835 --> 03:09:07.302
THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:09:07.369 --> 03:09:08.503
PROJECTS --

03:09:08.570 --> 03:09:09.438
WRIT LARGE IS THAT --

03:09:09.504 --> 03:09:11.006
THERE WEREN'T PROPOSE PROJECTS

03:09:11.073 --> 03:09:12.407
AT THE TIME WE RETURN ELSE'S WE

03:09:12.474 --> 03:09:13.475
RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE GET

03:09:13.542 --> 03:09:16.211
A LIST OF PROJECTS BEFORE

03:09:16.278 --> 03:09:16.878
APPROPRIATING FUNDS.

03:09:16.945 --> 03:09:17.512
I WILL NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY

03:09:17.579 --> 03:09:20.282
SUBMITTED TO OUR OFFICE --

03:09:20.348 --> 03:09:21.316
A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT INTENSE

03:09:21.383 --> 03:09:23.285
I IT APPEARS FOR BOTH THE ONE

03:09:23.351 --> 03:09:24.686
TIME FUNDING IN THE BOND FUNDING

03:09:24.753 --> 03:09:25.520
WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THAT LIST

03:09:25.587 --> 03:09:27.155
WE RECEIVED AT MONDAY AFTERNOON

03:09:27.222 --> 03:09:28.223
BUT THE UNIVERSITY WAS WORKING

03:09:28.290 --> 03:09:29.391
WITH US TO PROVIDE.

03:09:29.458 --> 03:09:30.425
MORE INFORMATION TO THE

03:09:30.492 --> 03:09:32.094
LEGISLATURE ON ON THE USE OF

03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:34.029
THOSE FUNDS.

03:09:34.096 --> 03:09:35.864
THE OTHER THING WE RECOMMENDED

03:09:35.931 --> 03:09:37.766
AND I THINK THIS GETS AT SOME OF

03:09:37.833 --> 03:09:39.101
THE BROADER QUESTION THAT YOU

03:09:39.167 --> 03:09:41.069
RAISE ABOUT --

03:09:41.136 --> 03:09:42.838
HAVING A LONG TERM PLAN TO

03:09:42.904 --> 03:09:44.072
ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

03:09:44.139 --> 03:09:46.541
CURLY THAT'S LACKING ACROSS ALL

03:09:46.608 --> 03:09:48.110
OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS.

03:09:48.176 --> 03:09:49.745
AND THAT DOESN'T GIVE THE

03:09:49.811 --> 03:09:51.947
LEGISLATURE MUCH --

03:09:52.013 --> 03:09:53.715
SENSE OF HOW IT THE THESE ONE

03:09:53.782 --> 03:09:55.083
TIME FUNDS EACH YEAR ARE REALLY

03:09:55.150 --> 03:09:56.418
GOING TO PAY DOWN THAT BACKLOG

03:09:56.485 --> 03:09:57.452
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

03:09:57.519 --> 03:10:00.355
LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE EACH

03:10:00.422 --> 03:10:02.991
SEGMENT TO INCLUDING YOU SEE.

03:10:03.058 --> 03:10:05.827
A LONG TERM PLAN TO RETIRE THIS

03:10:05.894 --> 03:10:07.529
BACKLOG AND THAT SUCH A PLAN

03:10:07.596 --> 03:10:09.564
WOULD IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT OF

03:10:09.631 --> 03:10:11.133
MONEY EACH YEAR NEEDED.

03:10:11.199 --> 03:10:11.933
TO RETIRE THAT BACK GLAD THAT

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:13.668
GIVE THE LEGISLATURE A BETTER A

03:10:13.735 --> 03:10:15.237
RATIONALE TO MAKE THESE SORT OF

03:10:15.303 --> 03:10:16.772
ONE TIME FUNDING DECISIONS.

03:10:16.838 --> 03:10:18.607
IN ADDITION TO THAT THE THAT

03:10:18.673 --> 03:10:20.108
PLAN WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A PLAN

03:10:20.175 --> 03:10:21.409
MOVING FORWARD AND HOW TO

03:10:21.476 --> 03:10:22.744
IMPROVE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES

03:10:22.811 --> 03:10:24.312
SUCH THAT A BACKLOG DOESN'T

03:10:24.379 --> 03:10:26.581
CONTINUE EACH YEAR AND ALL

03:10:26.648 --> 03:10:27.082
MAINTENANCE IS.

03:10:27.149 --> 03:10:29.651
PART OF THE REGULAR ONGOING

03:10:29.718 --> 03:10:31.219
OPERATIONS.

03:10:31.286 --> 03:10:32.454
MAYBE YOU SAID THIS DEFERRED

03:10:32.521 --> 03:10:33.488
MAINTENANCE HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

03:10:33.555 --> 03:10:34.122
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MAINTENANCE

03:10:34.189 --> 03:10:35.390
THAT.

03:10:35.457 --> 03:10:37.459
THAT REQUIRES CONSTRUCTION SO

03:10:37.526 --> 03:10:38.693
YOU'RE IMPROVING --

03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:40.495
CAPITAL FACILITY FOR EXAMPLE AS

03:10:40.562 --> 03:10:42.097
OPPOSED --

03:10:42.164 --> 03:10:43.765
TO REPLACING AN AIR CONDITIONING

03:10:43.832 --> 03:10:47.769
SYSTEM OR HEATING SYSTEM OR

03:10:47.836 --> 03:10:49.838
SOMETHING ELSE THAT.

03:10:49.905 --> 03:10:51.139
I WOULD THINK THAT LONG TERM

03:10:51.206 --> 03:10:52.274
BOND MONEY WOULD BE --

03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:53.341
IT WOULD BE QUESTIONABLE USE OF

03:10:53.408 --> 03:10:57.312
THAT SORT OF FUNDING STREAM.

03:10:57.379 --> 03:10:58.647
THAT'S RIGHT SO --

03:10:58.713 --> 03:10:59.948
TECHNICALLY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:11:00.015 --> 03:11:01.917
REFERS TO THE LATTER OF WHICH

03:11:01.983 --> 03:11:03.785
YOU DESCRIBE IT REFERS.

03:11:03.852 --> 03:11:05.387
TO H. FAQ REPLACEMENTS OTHER

03:11:05.453 --> 03:11:06.555
SERVER IN --

03:11:06.621 --> 03:11:08.857
FACILITY REPLACEMENTS THAT

03:11:08.924 --> 03:11:10.292
MAINTAIN THE USEFUL LIFE IT

03:11:10.358 --> 03:11:11.693
TYPICALLY DOESN'T INCLUDE

03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:12.727
CONSTRUCTION.

03:11:12.794 --> 03:11:14.830
OUR RENOVATIONS OR CORRECTIONS

03:11:14.896 --> 03:11:16.598
ARE THINGS THAT THAT CHANGE THE

03:11:16.665 --> 03:11:18.200
NATURE OF THE BUILDING.

03:11:18.266 --> 03:11:20.602
WE DID RAISE CONCERNS WITH.

03:11:20.669 --> 03:11:22.270
ADDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO

03:11:22.337 --> 03:11:23.972
AN ALLOWABLE USE A BOND FUNDS

03:11:24.039 --> 03:11:27.909
AND OF I THINK WHAT WAS ADDED IN

03:11:27.976 --> 03:11:28.677
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN RAISE THE

03:11:28.743 --> 03:11:29.678
CONCERN THEN.

03:11:29.744 --> 03:11:31.079
I'M WE WE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE

03:11:31.146 --> 03:11:32.047
EVEN A RATIONAL FOR SOME

03:11:32.113 --> 03:11:33.181
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS OF

03:11:33.248 --> 03:11:34.649
MIGHT HAVE A LONG USEFUL LIFE

03:11:34.716 --> 03:11:36.284
BUT WE WANTED SOME MORE WE

03:11:36.351 --> 03:11:37.152
RECOMMENDED THERE IS THERE BE

03:11:37.219 --> 03:11:38.620
MORE DEFINITION AS TO WHAT.

03:11:38.687 --> 03:11:39.955
CONSTITUTED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:11:40.021 --> 03:11:41.957
AND WOULD BE ALLOWABLE USE FOR

03:11:42.023 --> 03:11:44.693
BOND FUNDS --

03:11:44.759 --> 03:11:46.394
YOU LOST THAT ARGUMENT

03:11:46.461 --> 03:11:46.695
[inaudible]

03:11:46.761 --> 03:11:48.029
CORRECTION GOTCHA.

03:11:48.096 --> 03:11:49.130
OKAY I WAS JUST WONDERING IT

03:11:49.197 --> 03:11:50.498
WOULD BE YOU KNOW.

03:11:50.565 --> 03:11:51.099
THAT'S A REAL THAT'S A

03:11:51.166 --> 03:11:53.268
REASONABLE CONCERN TO RAISE.

03:11:53.335 --> 03:11:55.904
WE WOULD PROBABLY GET A HOME BUT

03:11:55.971 --> 03:11:57.472
I GUESS WE DO IT HERE.

03:11:57.539 --> 03:11:58.840
ON THE NET AND THOSE ARE THOSE

03:11:58.907 --> 03:11:59.774
ARE THE THREE ISSUES I THAT

03:11:59.841 --> 03:12:00.475
CONCLUDES MY REMARKS

03:12:00.542 --> 03:12:00.775
[inaudible]

03:12:00.842 --> 03:12:03.011
YOU SEE.

03:12:03.078 --> 03:12:05.747
I THANK YOU SENATOR WE REQUEST --

03:12:05.814 --> 03:12:07.449
YOUR APPROVAL OF THE GOVERNOR'S

03:12:07.515 --> 03:12:09.150
PROPOSED HUNDRED AND THIRTY

03:12:09.217 --> 03:12:10.051
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR

03:12:10.118 --> 03:12:11.653
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE YOU SEE

03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:13.355
CURRENTLY HAS THE FOUR POINT

03:12:13.421 --> 03:12:14.923
FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG THAT

03:12:14.990 --> 03:12:16.191
YOU HEARD ABOUT --

03:12:16.258 --> 03:12:17.726
THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO ADDRESS

03:12:17.792 --> 03:12:19.594
THE MOST CRITICALPROJECTS AND

03:12:19.661 --> 03:12:20.295
WERE.

03:12:20.362 --> 03:12:21.997
WERE VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO BE

03:12:22.063 --> 03:12:24.733
RECEIVING THESE FUNDS --

03:12:24.799 --> 03:12:26.568
WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE A

03:12:26.635 --> 03:12:28.203
CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT A

03:12:28.270 --> 03:12:29.537
LONG TERM PLAN.

03:12:29.604 --> 03:12:31.206
ON ADDRESSING THE DEFERRED

03:12:31.273 --> 03:12:33.675
MAINTENANCE ISSUES AT UC --

03:12:33.742 --> 03:12:35.410
I THINK OUR INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY

03:12:35.477 --> 03:12:37.178
WILL HELP WITH THAT ONCE WE HAVE

03:12:37.245 --> 03:12:40.949
AN IDEA OF OF WHAT.

03:12:41.016 --> 03:12:46.488
NEEDS TO GET FIXED OUR OR SURE --

03:12:46.554 --> 03:12:47.122
TO MAINTENANCE PROJECTS SO THAT

03:12:47.188 --> 03:12:50.158
WE MAXIMIZE --

03:12:50.225 --> 03:12:52.127
SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

03:12:52.193 --> 03:12:53.561
EFFICIENCIES GREAT TAKE

03:12:53.628 --> 03:12:54.462
ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE

03:12:54.529 --> 03:12:56.331
EFFICIENCIES WE CAN TAKE FOR

03:12:56.398 --> 03:12:57.632
EXAMPLE --

03:12:57.699 --> 03:12:59.401
IF WE HAVE AN AIR CONDITIONING

03:12:59.467 --> 03:13:01.303
SYSTEM THAT'S ABOUT TO FAIL WE

03:13:01.369 --> 03:13:02.804
WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AND SEE

03:13:02.871 --> 03:13:04.072
THAT MAYBE THERE'S TWENTY SUCH

03:13:04.139 --> 03:13:06.041
AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS ON ALL

03:13:06.107 --> 03:13:06.908
OUR CAMPUSES.

03:13:06.975 --> 03:13:08.143
AND THEN WE COULD NEGOTIATE A

03:13:08.209 --> 03:13:10.812
BETTER RATE WITH --

03:13:10.879 --> 03:13:13.615
WITH A PROVIDER FOR FOR THOSE

03:13:13.682 --> 03:13:15.383
ARE TWO UNITS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

03:13:15.450 --> 03:13:16.484
HOPING TO DO THIS ONE OF THE

03:13:16.551 --> 03:13:17.485
WHERE WE GET IT WE COULD HAVE A

03:13:17.552 --> 03:13:19.721
CONVERSATION WITH YOU IN THE

03:13:19.788 --> 03:13:22.123
ADMINISTRATION ON WHY WE WOULD

03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:22.657
BORROW.

03:13:22.724 --> 03:13:23.758
LET'S SAY I DON'T KNOW THE

03:13:23.825 --> 03:13:24.759
LENGTH OF THE BONDS BUT WHY WE

03:13:24.826 --> 03:13:26.394
WOULD BORROW AND USE THIRTY YOUR

03:13:26.461 --> 03:13:27.862
MONEY.

03:13:27.929 --> 03:13:29.064
BUY A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT

03:13:29.130 --> 03:13:31.766
HAS A SEVEN YEAR USEFUL LIFE AND

03:13:31.833 --> 03:13:34.636
MAYBE THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY.

03:13:34.703 --> 03:13:36.905
TO TO FINANCE THAT.

03:13:36.972 --> 03:13:39.708
OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND.

03:13:39.774 --> 03:13:41.176
TO CREATE A POOL FOR THAT SORT

03:13:41.242 --> 03:13:44.312
OF EQUIPMENT PURCHASES OPPOSED.

03:13:44.379 --> 03:13:45.280
TO YOU'RE GOING TO THE MARKET TO

03:13:45.347 --> 03:13:47.182
BORROW.

03:13:47.248 --> 03:13:48.950
X. AMOUNT OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

03:13:49.017 --> 03:13:49.751
FOR THIRTY YEARS TO BUY THAT

03:13:49.818 --> 03:13:51.119
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT YOU'RE

03:13:51.186 --> 03:13:53.688
GOING TO HAVE TO BUY. THREE OR

03:13:53.755 --> 03:13:55.056
FOUR TIMES FOR OR TWO OR THREE

03:13:55.123 --> 03:13:57.058
TIMES DURING MY MAKING SENSE

03:13:57.125 --> 03:13:58.460
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR DO I

03:13:58.526 --> 03:14:01.930
NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS.

03:14:01.997 --> 03:14:04.566
IN THE ARMY TO CRITICIZE.

03:14:04.632 --> 03:14:05.400
THANK YOU SENATOR --

03:14:05.467 --> 03:14:06.968
GENERALLY A LOT OF THE DEFERRED

03:14:07.035 --> 03:14:09.371
MAINTENANCE THAT IS BEING FUNDED

03:14:09.437 --> 03:14:11.306
WOULD BE SUCH AS BOILERS OR

03:14:11.373 --> 03:14:13.208
EIGHT TRACK SYSTEMS THAT TEND TO

03:14:13.274 --> 03:14:15.043
HAVE A USEFUL LIFE THAT WOULD BE

03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:16.945
LONGER THAN THAT THE TERM OF THE

03:14:17.012 --> 03:14:17.779
BOND.

03:14:17.846 --> 03:14:20.515
ALSO A LITTLE WHILE THAT MAKES

03:14:20.582 --> 03:14:21.583
OUR FALL GEO BONDS ARE OFTEN

03:14:21.649 --> 03:14:22.984
THOUGHT OF AS TWENTY FIVE OR

03:14:23.051 --> 03:14:25.020
THIRTY YEAR BONDS IT IS POSSIBLE

03:14:25.086 --> 03:14:26.287
TO STILL SHORTER TERM BONDS SO

03:14:26.354 --> 03:14:27.155
SAY.

03:14:27.222 --> 03:14:29.290
IF IT IS A CHILLER SYSTEM THAT'S

03:14:29.357 --> 03:14:34.529
SUPPOSED TO BE FIFTEEN YEARS.

03:14:34.596 --> 03:14:35.730
THEN YOU CAN SELL BONDS THAT

03:14:35.797 --> 03:14:36.564
WOULD BE PAID OFF IN ABOUT

03:14:36.631 --> 03:14:37.232
FIFTEEN YEARS AND SO THERE IS AN

03:14:37.298 --> 03:14:37.832
EFFORT TO MATCH THE LENGTH OF

03:14:37.899 --> 03:14:39.467
THE BOND WITH THE USEFUL LIFE OF

03:14:39.534 --> 03:14:42.203
THE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

03:14:42.270 --> 03:14:43.938
ITEM THAT YOU'RE WORKING NOW

03:14:44.005 --> 03:14:46.975
CERTAINLY THE GOAL SIR --

03:14:47.042 --> 03:14:48.543
BECAUSE THESE ARE YOU CEASE OWN

03:14:48.610 --> 03:14:50.211
INTERNAL BORROWING CAPACITY WE

03:14:50.278 --> 03:14:52.380
CAN CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE PAY

03:14:52.447 --> 03:14:53.782
BACK AMOUNT --

03:14:53.848 --> 03:14:55.650
WE DO AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE

03:14:55.717 --> 03:14:57.786
CONSULTANT AND PALEO THAT --

03:14:57.852 --> 03:14:59.587
IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO MOVE THE

03:14:59.654 --> 03:15:01.423
INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY OUT OF THE

03:15:01.489 --> 03:15:02.724
BOND INTO THE ONE TIME FUNDS

03:15:02.791 --> 03:15:05.060
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR SO IF

03:15:05.126 --> 03:15:05.693
YOU WOULD PERMIT US TO DO THAT

03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:06.227
WE'LL.

03:15:06.294 --> 03:15:07.462
WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT SO THAT

03:15:07.529 --> 03:15:08.897
THE BORROWING CAPACITY IS NOT

03:15:08.963 --> 03:15:10.465
PAYING FOR THE STUDY.

03:15:10.532 --> 03:15:12.267
OF BUT RATHER TO ONE TIME FUNDS

03:15:12.333 --> 03:15:13.735
WE WOULD GET WOULD PAY FOR THAT

03:15:13.802 --> 03:15:15.203
THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

03:15:15.270 --> 03:15:17.005
INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY THAT MAKES

03:15:17.072 --> 03:15:19.040
A LOT OF SENSE AND THANK YOU

03:15:19.107 --> 03:15:21.876
THAT THE LA ON TO THE COMMITTEE

03:15:21.943 --> 03:15:23.845
CONSULTANT FOR THAT --

03:15:23.912 --> 03:15:25.447
THE REASON WE HAVE DEVELOPED

03:15:25.513 --> 03:15:27.315
THIS VERY LENGTHY SOME OF THE

03:15:27.382 --> 03:15:28.850
REASONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED A VERY

03:15:28.917 --> 03:15:30.585
LENGTHY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:15:30.652 --> 03:15:31.820
PROJECT LIST IS THAT.

03:15:31.886 --> 03:15:33.455
YOU SEE UNDERWENT A LOT OF

03:15:33.521 --> 03:15:35.123
CONSTRUCTION DURING THE NINETEEN

03:15:35.190 --> 03:15:37.859
SIXTIES AND THESE BUILDINGS ARE

03:15:37.926 --> 03:15:38.493
NOW GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE

03:15:38.560 --> 03:15:40.428
THEY'RE STARTING TO FALL APART

03:15:40.495 --> 03:15:43.598
AND EVERYTHING IS BREAKING --

03:15:43.665 --> 03:15:44.799
AND WHILE [inaudible]

03:15:44.866 --> 03:15:47.335
WE WERE.

03:15:47.402 --> 03:15:49.504
HAVING OUR BUDGETS REDUCED OR

03:15:49.571 --> 03:15:51.806
NOT GROWN ENOUGH TO MEET SOME OF

03:15:51.873 --> 03:15:53.875
THE INSTRUCTIONAL DEMANDS OF OUR

03:15:53.942 --> 03:15:55.410
STUDENTS --

03:15:55.477 --> 03:15:58.546
WE SCALED BACK SOME OF THESE

03:15:58.613 --> 03:15:59.280
MAKE THOSE FUNDS THAT WAS AND

03:15:59.347 --> 03:16:01.850
THAT WAS ONE PLACE TO SCALE BACK.

03:16:01.916 --> 03:16:03.351
SO REALLY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:16:03.418 --> 03:16:06.020
AND OF BEING A REFLECTION OF THE

03:16:06.087 --> 03:16:07.789
UNIVERSITY'S ABILITY TO TAKE

03:16:07.856 --> 03:16:09.824
CARE OF ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS

03:16:09.891 --> 03:16:10.792
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE PLACES

03:16:10.859 --> 03:16:11.559
WHERE.

03:16:11.626 --> 03:16:13.528
OUR CUTBACKS WERE MADE WHEN

03:16:13.595 --> 03:16:15.029
FUNDS WERE NEEDED TO BE SHIFTED

03:16:15.096 --> 03:16:16.231
ELSEWHERE.

03:16:16.297 --> 03:16:17.599
THAT HASN'T BEEN ARCTIC

03:16:17.665 --> 03:16:19.267
ADEQUATELY FUNDED WELL I'M VERY

03:16:19.334 --> 03:16:20.969
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WE'RE FACING

03:16:21.035 --> 03:16:22.470
YOU'RE FACING AN ADULT THE STUDY

03:16:22.537 --> 03:16:25.740
IS IMPERATIVE AND HOWEVER WE

03:16:25.807 --> 03:16:26.708
FINANCE IT.

03:16:26.774 --> 03:16:27.876
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE

03:16:27.942 --> 03:16:29.711
RESULTS ALL RIGHT --

03:16:29.777 --> 03:16:31.079
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS

03:16:31.146 --> 03:16:33.748
ABOUT THE UC SANTA CRUZ AND UC

03:16:33.815 --> 03:16:36.484
SANTA BARBARA PROJECTS THAT WERE

03:16:36.551 --> 03:16:37.519
PRODUCT BY DE LA OKAY --

03:16:37.585 --> 03:16:38.686
FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO POINT

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE

03:19:21.015 --> 03:19:21.849
TWO PROJECTS --

03:19:21.916 --> 03:19:23.251
THAT I RAISED CONCERNS WITH

03:19:23.318 --> 03:19:23.951
EARLIER.

03:19:24.018 --> 03:19:25.286

03:19:31.092 --> 03:19:32.026
QUESTION YOU RAISED AS WELL

03:19:32.093 --> 03:19:33.394
SHOULDN'T STUDENTS HAVE A CHOICE

03:19:33.461 --> 03:19:34.295

FACE TO FACE AND ONLINE

03:19:35.697 --> 03:19:37.398
INSTRUCTION AND ALL WE WERE

03:19:37.465 --> 03:19:38.700
SUGGESTING IS THAT --

03:19:38.766 --> 03:19:40.735
YOU SEE COULD GRADUALLY MOVE

03:19:40.802 --> 03:19:41.969
TOWARDS USING INCORPORATING I'M

03:19:42.036 --> 03:19:44.038
ONLINE INSTRUCTION MORE IT STILL

HAS A LECTURE HALLS THAT USES

03:19:46.607 --> 03:19:47.475
FOR FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION TO

03:19:47.542 --> 03:19:48.710
STUDENTS STILL WOULD HAVE THAT

03:19:48.776 --> 03:19:49.243
CHOICE IT WOULD JUST BE A

03:19:49.310 --> 03:19:51.212
QUESTION OF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE

03:19:51.279 --> 03:19:52.914
TO EXPAND THOSE KINDS OF SPACES

03:19:52.980 --> 03:19:53.147
OR DO.

03:19:53.214 --> 03:19:54.515
YOU WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON THE

03:19:54.582 --> 03:19:55.750
LOWER --

03:19:55.817 --> 03:19:57.385
SMALLER CLASSROOMS WHERE THAT

03:19:57.452 --> 03:19:58.953
THERE'S MAYBE MORE OF THAT TRADE

03:19:59.020 --> 03:20:00.388
OFF BETWEEN --

03:20:00.455 --> 03:20:02.957

03:20:07.962 --> 03:20:08.763
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND I'M SURE

03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:09.731
WE'RE GONNA HAVE CONTINUED

03:20:09.797 --> 03:20:11.632
DISCUSSION I WOULD AGREE WITH

03:20:11.699 --> 03:20:14.168
YOU I THINK OF OUR INSTITUTIONS

03:20:14.235 --> 03:20:16.671
OF OUR SYSTEMS ALL THREE COULD

03:20:16.738 --> 03:20:18.306
DO MORE WITH ONLINE.

03:20:18.373 --> 03:20:19.774
THIS IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE --

03:20:19.841 --> 03:20:21.142
UNDER THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION

03:20:21.209 --> 03:20:22.410
IS STEPPING OUT FAIRLY SMARTLY

03:20:22.477 --> 03:20:25.980
ON AT THE BEGINNING STAGES BUT

03:20:26.047 --> 03:20:27.915
SEE ISSUE AND YOU SEE --

03:20:27.982 --> 03:20:29.517
HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT ONLINE IT'S

03:20:29.584 --> 03:20:32.320
A DEBATE AND INTERNAL DEBATE --

03:20:32.387 --> 03:20:34.122
I KNOW I THINK I KNOW WITH THE

03:20:34.188 --> 03:20:36.491
ACADEMIC SENATE AND FACULTY AND

03:20:36.557 --> 03:20:38.092
WHETHER ONLINE IS GOOD --

03:20:38.159 --> 03:20:40.361
ONLINE IS BAD BUT I'M SURE YOU

03:20:40.428 --> 03:20:42.597

03:20:42.663 --> 03:20:45.166
THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND AND WERE

03:20:45.233 --> 03:20:47.235
APPROPRIATE TRY --

03:20:47.301 --> 03:20:49.137
TO AND ONLINE PROGRAMS.

03:20:49.203 --> 03:20:50.671
BUT IN THE INTERIM AS WE PUSH

03:20:50.738 --> 03:20:51.539
THEM.

03:20:51.606 --> 03:20:52.907
TO TAKE IN MORE STUDENTS WE NEED

03:20:52.974 --> 03:20:53.741
TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

03:20:53.808 --> 03:20:55.176
CLASSROOMS TEACHING MEN AND SO

03:20:55.243 --> 03:20:56.144
THAT'S WHY I MADE THE COMMENT

03:20:56.210 --> 03:20:58.146
I'D I DID BUT I CERTAINLY

03:20:58.212 --> 03:20:59.046

THANK YOU JUST WANTED TO MAKE

03:21:01.282 --> 03:21:02.683
SURE I GAVE YOU THAT INFORMATION

03:21:02.750 --> 03:21:04.819
THE OTHER INFORMATION --

03:21:04.886 --> 03:21:05.420
JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE

03:21:05.486 --> 03:21:07.321
OF IS -- AS

03:21:07.388 --> 03:21:08.222
YOUR WEIGHING BETWEEN THE TWO

03:21:08.289 --> 03:21:09.424
CAMPUSES SANTA CRUZ IN SANTA

03:21:09.490 --> 03:21:09.824
BARBARA.

03:21:09.891 --> 03:21:11.893
SANTA CRUZ DOES HAVE A LOT MORE

03:21:11.959 --> 03:21:13.194
CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS THROUGH

03:21:13.261 --> 03:21:14.996
LARGE LECTURE HALLS ARE ARE

03:21:15.062 --> 03:21:16.264
HEAVILY UTILIZED AND THEIR LOOK

03:21:16.330 --> 03:21:17.865
SMALLER CLASSROOMS ALSO HEAVILY

03:21:17.932 --> 03:21:20.802
UTILIZED IN THE PROJECT WOULD DO

03:21:20.868 --> 03:21:23.604
A MIX OF BOTH AND THERE WAS SOME

03:21:23.671 --> 03:21:24.539
WE SAW SOME MERIT THERE WE HAD

03:21:24.605 --> 03:21:26.174
SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS WITH.

03:21:26.240 --> 03:21:26.741
SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL SPACE

03:21:26.808 --> 03:21:27.975
WHICH I'M HAPPY TO ELABORATE ON

03:21:28.042 --> 03:21:28.576
IF IF.

03:21:28.643 --> 03:21:29.710
THAT'S OF INTEREST TO THE

03:21:29.777 --> 03:21:30.845
COMMITTEE BUT THE SMALLER

03:21:30.912 --> 03:21:32.413
CLASSROOM SPACE HAD SOME MERIT

03:21:32.480 --> 03:21:32.713
[inaudible]

03:21:32.780 --> 03:21:34.515
BARBER CAMPUS.

03:21:34.582 --> 03:21:35.817
DOES HE WAS THERE A LARGE

03:21:35.883 --> 03:21:37.418
LECTURES OVER A 100% THEY'RE

03:21:37.485 --> 03:21:38.853
SMALLER CLASSROOMS ARE NOT USE

03:21:38.920 --> 03:21:40.455
THAT CAPACITY AND THE PROJECT

03:21:40.521 --> 03:21:42.156
CAN INCLUDE A MIX OF BOTH SMALL

03:21:42.223 --> 03:21:43.858
AND LARGE SPACE AND SO THAT WAS

03:21:43.925 --> 03:21:44.792
ONE RESULT.

03:21:44.859 --> 03:21:46.194
THE SCOPE OF THE SMALLER

03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:48.563
CLASSROOMS ALSO --

03:21:48.629 --> 03:21:49.797
HAD MAYBE LESS AMERICAN SAY AT

03:21:49.864 --> 03:21:51.199
THE SANTA CRUZ CAMPUS NOW GIVEN

03:21:51.265 --> 03:21:53.434
THE EXISTING UP PROCESS THE

03:21:53.501 --> 03:21:54.535
LEGISLATURE HAS A LOT LESS

03:21:54.602 --> 03:21:56.671
ABILITY TO PROVE A REJECT

03:21:56.737 --> 03:21:59.140
PROPOSALS HAVE EVEN LESS ABILITY.

03:21:59.207 --> 03:22:00.575
TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OF PROJECTS

03:22:00.641 --> 03:22:02.376
AND SO THAT THAT'S THE SORT OF

03:22:02.443 --> 03:22:03.811
COMPLEXITY IS REVIEWING THESE

03:22:03.878 --> 03:22:04.712
DIFFERENT SCOPES BUT THAT THAT

03:22:04.779 --> 03:22:06.247
SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR

03:22:06.314 --> 03:22:09.383
THOSE PROJECTS AS REVIEWING THEM.

03:22:09.450 --> 03:22:11.018
THANK YOU YES MA'AM.

03:22:11.085 --> 03:22:12.854
IF I MAY JUST COMMENT ABOUT THE

03:22:12.920 --> 03:22:14.322
WAY YOU.

03:22:14.388 --> 03:22:15.523
YOU SEE COMES UP WITH THESE

03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:17.391
PROJECTS IS THAT THERE IS A

03:22:17.458 --> 03:22:18.459
LENGTHY.

03:22:18.526 --> 03:22:21.128
OF APPROVAL AND REVIEW PROCESS

03:22:21.195 --> 03:22:23.030
OFF THEM WHERE THEY CAMPUSES

03:22:23.097 --> 03:22:24.599
DEVELOP A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT

03:22:24.665 --> 03:22:25.533
PLAN.

03:22:25.600 --> 03:22:27.268
OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY FOLKS ON

03:22:27.335 --> 03:22:28.603
THOSE CAMPUSES CAREFULLY

03:22:28.669 --> 03:22:30.571
EXAMINED THE NEEDS AND WHAT IT

03:22:30.638 --> 03:22:31.272
WOULD TAKE TO CONSTRUCT A

03:22:31.339 --> 03:22:32.173
BUILDING.

03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:34.542
IT GETS ON A TEN YEAR OF PLAN

03:22:34.609 --> 03:22:35.943
FOR THE CAMPUS THAT GETS

03:22:36.010 --> 03:22:37.178
APPROVED BY THE REGENTS.

03:22:37.245 --> 03:22:39.180
THEN WHEN THE PROJECT IS COMING

03:22:39.247 --> 03:22:40.515
UP FOR DEVELOPMENT.

03:22:40.581 --> 03:22:43.384
OF THE REDO THOSE PLANS AGAIN

03:22:43.451 --> 03:22:44.986
WERE MUCH MORE DETAIL SO IT'S NO

03:22:45.052 --> 03:22:45.853
LONGER BACK OF THE ENVELOPE BUT

03:22:45.920 --> 03:22:48.956
THEY'VE REALLY LOOK AT THE SITE

03:22:49.023 --> 03:22:53.628
AND WHAT THE WHAT ARE THE WHAT

03:22:53.694 --> 03:22:55.963
ARE THE BEST WAYS TO ADDRESS THE

03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:57.331
