SENATE BILL TWELVE FORTY EIGHT.

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:42.560
GIVEN CENTER BAKER'S COMMITMENT

00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:45.030
TO WITHDRAW THE COMMENTS-

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:47.766
REGARDING THE- THE BILL'S IMPACT

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:05.316
DANGER OF IMPACTING EXIT-

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:06.584
CURRENT LITIGATION THAT HAS BEEN

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:08.586
ONGOING FOR EIGHT YEARS AND

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:10.422
DEALS WITH EXACTLY THE TYPES OF

00:28:10.488 --> 00:28:14.592
ISSUES- THERE WOULD BE REYES. BY

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:18.696
THIS BILL. ONE OF THEM IS THAT-

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:20.432
THE TREATMENT OF MINOR LEAGUE

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:22.467
PLAYERS AS NON EXEMPT EMPLOYEES

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.003
IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BRING INTO

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.673
PLAY ALL SORTS OF- THINGS THAT.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.141
TEAMS AND PLAYERS NORMALLY DO

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:32.010
NOT DO FOR EXAMPLE TAKING REST

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:34.112
BREAKS AND MEAL BREAKS DURING

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:36.147
THE COURSE OF THE GAME. THOSE

00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:39.818
ARE JUST ONE OF THE VERY MANY-

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:41.386
THINGS THAT WOULD COME INTO PLAY

00:28:41.453 --> 00:28:45.190
IF THIS BILL WERE. ENACTED TO

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:47.225
MAKE PLAYERS EXACT PLAYERS. I'M

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:49.461
GOING TO FOCUS ON THE N. I. L.

00:28:49.527 --> 00:28:52.330
PROVISION- THIS BILL WOULD VOID

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:54.799
ANY PROVISION IN A MINOR LEAGUE

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:55.967
CONTRACT THAT COULD INTERFERE

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:58.203
WITH THE PLAYERS RIGHT. TO USE

00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:59.237
THE PLAYER'S NAME IMAGE OR

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:01.372
LIKENESS ALSO KNOWN AS AND I ALL

00:29:01.439 --> 00:29:03.575
RIGHT. THIS TOO IS UNNECESSARY

00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:05.143
BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING IN A

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.012
MINOR LEAGUE CONTRACT. I WAS A

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:12.650
PLAYER OF HIS AND I ALL RIGHT.

00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:13.785
FOR A MINOR LEAGUE CONTRACT

00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:15.086
GRANT EACH PLAYER'S CLUB THE

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:17.455
RIGHTS THAT IT NEEDS IN ORDER TO

00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:18.756
PROMOTE THE TEAM AND THE PLAYER.

00:29:18.823 --> 00:29:20.225
THE CONTRACT ALSO GRANTS THE

00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:21.359
CLUB THE RIGHT TO REVIEW AND

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.027
APPROVE OF PLAYERS USE OF HIS

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:24.896
AND I ALL RIGHT. THIS APPROVAL

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:27.465
PROCESS IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:29.134
A PLAYER WILL NOT AUTHORIZE THE

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.869
USE OF THESE RIGHTS IN

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:32.003
CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCT

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.205
GROUP OR ACTIVITY. THAT COULD BE

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.840
EMBARRASSING OR DETRIMENTAL TO

00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:38.243
THE PLAYER OR THE CLUB. THAT'S

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:39.811
WHY EVEN MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:41.079
HAVE AGREED IN COLLECTIVE

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:42.981
BARGAINING THE CLUB SHOULD HAVE

00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:44.682
A RIGHT TO REVIEW AND APPROVE

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:46.751
APPROVE A PLAYER'S USE OF THEIR-

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:49.287
RIGHTS FOR THE REASON I'VE

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:51.956
DECIDED- WE OPPOSE SENATE BILL

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:53.358
TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. NOW I'D LIKE

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:56.728
TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE

00:29:56.794 --> 00:30:00.598

FRANCISCO GIANTS. AND I'M GONNA

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:08.506
FOCUS ON THE FOR YOUR NATURE OF

00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:11.409
THE CONTRACT PROPOSAL- OBVIOUSLY

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.077
THERE'S A LOT. OF COMPLEXITIES

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:15.547
TO THIS LITIGATION- TO THIS THIS

00:30:15.613 --> 00:30:17.382
LEGISLATION AND THERE'S- THEY'RE

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:18.850
BEING PLAYED OUT IN LITIGATION

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:20.685
RIGHT NOW WITH RESPECT TO MILEY

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:23.788
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS- SO.

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:26.958
THE ISSUE OF MOVING FROM A SEVEN

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.226
TO A FOUR YEAR CONTRACT. THIS

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:30.295
PROVISION WOULD BE VERY HARMFUL

00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:31.863
TO CALIFORNIA BASED CLUBS A

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.799
CALIFORNIA BASED PLAYERS IN MANY

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:35.967
RESPECTS. IT CREATES A DIFFERENT

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:38.870
SET OF RULES ARE FOR CALIFORNIA

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:40.705
BASED CLUBS AND FOR CALIFORNIA

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:43.775
RESIDENTS AND FOR OF PLAYERS

00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:45.843
THAT PLAY FOR CALIFORNIA TEAMS.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:46.911
IT'S DIFFICULT TO OPERATE A

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:49.247
LEAGUE WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:51.049
ENGAGEMENT. BETWEEN THE

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:54.052
DIFFERENT CLUBS. FOR EXAMPLE OF

00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:55.820
A SEVEN YEAR CONTRACT VERSUS

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:57.589
FOUR YEAR CONTRACT MANY MINOR

00:30:57.655 --> 00:31:00.091
LEAGUE PLAYERS DO NOT MAKE THE

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:01.025
MAJOR LEAGUES WITHIN THE FOUR

00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:02.594
YEAR TIME FRAME. THIS IS

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.629
PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH PLAYERS

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:06.264
THAT ARE INTERNATIONAL OF THE

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:07.198
CHOSEN FROM AN EARLY

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:09.334
INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OR HAVE

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.702
NOT ATTENDED COLLEGE IN UNITED

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:12.637
STATES WHERE IT'S CUSTOMARY FOR

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:14.072
PLAYERS TO SPEND MORE THAN FOUR

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:15.773
YEARS IN THE MINOR LEAGUE SYSTEM

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.177
BEFORE THEY MAKE THE MAJORS. AND

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:20.445
SO IF YOU'RE A CALIFORNIA BASED

00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:22.113
CLUB. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.915
RECRUIT PLAYERS. IT'S A HUGE

00:31:23.982 --> 00:31:30.388
DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE. LIKELY NOT

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:31.723
TO MAKE THE MAJORS WITHIN FOUR

00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:33.224
YEARS MEANS THAT YOU WOULD

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:35.159
PROBABLY FOCUS YOUR ENERGIES ON

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:36.961
SIGNING COLLEGE PLAYERS WERE

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:38.796
MORE LIKELY TO MAKE THE MAJORS

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:40.298
WITHIN THE FOUR YEAR TIME FRAME

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.300
AND THEREFORE CALIFORNIA BASED

OF PLAYERS WHO DO NOT HAVE

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:45.303
COLLEGE BASEBALL EXPERIENCE WILL

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.106
BE GREATLY DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE

00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:50.174

00:31:56.648 --> 00:31:58.516
NOT WANT TO SIGN FOREIGN BORN

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:11.029
IN TIME AS WELL. IF YOU'RE A

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:13.097

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:23.975

RESPECT TO A CALIFORNIA CLUB WE

AND IF WE CAN ONLY SIGN COLLEGE

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.606

MINOR LEAGUE PLAYERS THAT ARE

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:58.676

WHO PLAYED IN HIGH SCHOOL AND

00:32:59.944 --> 00:33:01.346
DON'T PLAYING COLLEGE WOULD BE

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:03.014
SOMEWHAT OFF LIMITS TO US AT

00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:04.916
THAT WE CAN'T. BE SURE THAT THEY

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.918
COULD MAKE IT IN TIME AND SO WE

00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:09.454
WOULD BE SIGNING FROM A LIMITED

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.788
POOL PLAYERS IN CALIFORNIA

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:11.356
PUTTING IT IS ALSO A HUGE

00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:13.091
COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. IS VIA

CALIFORNIA'S PLAYERS WERE ALSO

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:17.829
PIECE THAT DISADVANTAGE IN THAT

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:19.530
THEY WOULD BE LESS MARKETABLE.

00:33:19.597 --> 00:33:21.299
AND FINALLY WE WOULD BE HAVING A

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:22.900
VERY DIFFICULT TIME TRADING A

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:24.669

TIME. IF THEY HAVE A LIMITED

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:29.407
CONTRACT LEFT- BECAUSE THAT

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:31.175
PLAYER WOULD BE OF LESS VALUE

00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:33.311
THAN A PLAYER. FOR US OF THAT

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:34.679
PLACE ROUTINE OUTSIDE OF

OF FOREIGN BORN PLAYER I SCHOOL

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:35.806
PLAYER. BUT IT'S ALSO A

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:37.475
DISADVANTAGE TO THOSE PLAYERS

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:40.010
THEMSELVES. WHO CAN ONLY SIGN A

NEW YORK YANKEES. AND YOU HAVE A

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.684
CHOICE BETWEEN A PLAYER THAT YOU

THE PLAYER THAT YOU CAN SIGN FOR

SEVEN YEARS SO THE PLAYERS WILL

00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:56.093
HAVE LESS OPPORTUNITY IF THEY

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.529
COME FROM CALIFORNIA. THAN THEY

00:39:58.596 --> 00:39:59.163
WOULD IF THEY CAME FROM OTHER

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.598
STATES. SO THIS WOULD

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:01.699
DISADVANTAGED BUT ONLY THE

BASED ON THEIR SKILLS. WE WANT

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:20.678

TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS. SO IT

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:33.057
IS RIGHT NOW MAKE YOUR THE

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:36.227
CONTENTION OF. THIS BILL AND-

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:37.661
THE ALL THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS

00:41:37.728 --> 00:41:39.630
BILL. THAT MAKING A HAVING A

00:41:39.697 --> 00:41:40.965
FOUR YEAR CONTRACT RATHER SEVEN

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.333
WOULD GIVE THAT LEVERAGE RIGHT

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:44.101
TO THINK ABOUT THE WITNESS WHO

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:46.237
TESTIFIED- THAT WAS. YOU KNOW WE

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:47.972
HAD TO WAIT TILL AFTER SEVEN

00:41:48.038 --> 00:41:49.607
YEARS- THAN DOING PERFORMING THE

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:52.243
SAME JOB. TO GET A TWELVE TIMES

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:55.145
HIGHER SALARY. AND SO PRESUMABLY

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:58.482
AFTER FOUR YEARS- THAT. ARE FOR

00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:00.951
A WITNESS- WOULD BE A MINOR

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.653
LEAGUE FREE AGENT. COULD HAVE

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.856
GOTTEN A MUCH HIGHER SALARY AT

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:07.258
THAT TIME. YEAH SO I THINK YOU

00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:08.959
KNOW A CLEARLY- I MEAN WHOLE

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:10.461
PREMISE OF FREE AGENCY IS THAT.

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:12.062
RIGHT IS THAT IT'S IN THE BEST

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:13.697
INTERESTS OF PLAYERS TO HAVE

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:15.532
THAT ABILITY TO GO AND

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.400
NEGOTIATE. AND THAT'S REALLY

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:18.269
THAT THE PREMISE I DON'T YOU

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:19.370
KNOW THAT THE CONTENTION IS

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:21.672
THAT. THAT WOULD MAKE YOU- TEAM

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:22.873
LESS LIKELY TO SIGN A YOUNG

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.141
PLAYERBECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:26.076
BEEN FOR FOUR YEARS AND IF THEY

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:28.112
MIGHT NOT SIGN THEM. AND I THINK

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:30.714
THE REALITY IS WE HAVE TO

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:31.348
BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW PLAYERS

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:33.884
WITH PROMISES ARE GOING TO GET

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:35.286
SIDE- AND FOR YOU TO GET THERE

00:42:35.352 --> 00:42:37.388
YOU FOUR YEARS TO VALUATE AND

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:39.156
AFTER THAT. YOU CAN STILL SIGN

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:39.957
THEM YOU KNOW IT IN UNDER OF OUR

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:42.126
BILL PASSES YOU FOR YEARS TO

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:43.761
EVALUATE. AND IF THE GREAT AND

00:42:43.827 --> 00:42:45.362
YOU WANT TO SIGN OF LONGER THAN

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:46.830
YOU CAN SIGN LONGER. RIGHT AND

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.265
AGAIN MOB COULD EVEN PUT A

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:49.033
PROVISION THAT YOU HAVE THE

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:51.802
RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL SOMEBODY

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:52.569
ELSE OFFERS THEM A MUCH BIGGER

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.238
DEAL YOU CAN MATCH THAT- AND-

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:55.205
AND WHY BEING. I'M SORRY TO

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:57.775
SWIM. WHY BEING FOREIGN BORN WHY

00:42:57.841 --> 00:43:00.844
IS THAT A DISADVANTAGE- I DON'T

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:01.879
THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS IS

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:04.848
VANISHING THE SCOUTING AND- IN

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.150
THESE COUNTRIES IS QUITE

00:43:06.216 --> 00:43:07.551
ADVANCED AND DEVELOPED AGAIN I

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:09.153
THINK THE CONTENTION WOULD BE IF

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:10.955
YOU ONLY FOUR YEARS YO'RE GOT

00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:12.423
WE ARE LESS LIKELY TO SIGN. A

00:43:12.489 --> 00:43:13.958
FORM FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE YOU KNOW

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.192
GENERALLY YOUNGER PLAYER THAN

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.927
YOU WOULD SAY A KID COMING OUT

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:19.797
OF COLLEGE IN THE US THAT'S THE

00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:21.231
CONTENTION YOU KNOW. BECAUSE

00:43:21.298 --> 00:43:23.867
THEY'VE ALREADY SHOWN THE KID

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:25.502
OUT OF COLLEGE IS ALREADY SHOWN

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:27.671
. BOB DOLE OR WOULD. YOU TO GET

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:30.140
TO IT JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN- YEAH

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:31.108
THAT THEY'RE OLDER AND YOU'VE

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:33.177
MORE YOU KNOW MORE. A MORE BODY

00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:36.447
WORK TO EVALUATE THEM ON. SO THE

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:38.415
CONTENTION WOULD BE THAT. YOU

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:41.885
pLIKELY TO SIGN SOMEONE- THE

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:45.255
FOREIGN BORN PLAYER. THAT YOU

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:46.523
YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE LESS TIME

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:50.728
TO EVALUATE. THE SENATE ADDRESS-

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:52.363
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR FROM

00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:56.233
THE- FROM THE WEST WITNESS. MR

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.068
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE AN

00:43:58.135 --> 00:43:59.370
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND YES-

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:01.372
FOREIGN BORN PLAYERS ARE SIGNED

00:44:01.438 --> 00:44:02.106
AND START PLAYING AT AGE

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:04.708
SEVENTEEN. THEY TYPICALLY PLAY

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:07.411
THREE YEARS OVERSEAS- IN THE

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:08.345
ACADEMIES IN THE DOMINICAN

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:10.147
REPUBLIC- AND THEN THEY

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:12.116
MATRICULATED UNITED STATES AND

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:13.450
THEY BEGIN THEIR CAREER IN

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:15.219
UNITED STATES AND SO IT'S VERY

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:17.021
RARE FOR A FOREIGN BORN PLAYER

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:18.589
TO MAKE THE MAJORS WITHIN FOUR

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:21.125
YEARS. SO THE ISSUE IS IF YOU'RE

00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:22.559
UNLIKELY TO GET THE BENEFIT OF

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:23.861
THE PLAYER MAKING THE MAJORS

00:44:23.927 --> 00:44:26.096
WITHIN FOUR YEARS WOULD YOU SIGN

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:28.432
INVEST IN THAT PLAYER. ARMED AND

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:29.633
ALL OTHER TEAMS OUTSIDE

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.101
CALIFORNIA THE TWENTY FIVE OTHER

00:44:31.168 --> 00:44:32.903
MAJOR LEAGUE CLUBS WOULD HAVE

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.538
THE ABILITY TO SIGN A PLAYER FOR

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:35.472
SEVEN YEARS AND THEREFORE

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:37.041
THEY'RE GOING TO SIGN PLAYERS

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:38.342
THAT ARE FOREIGN BORN AT A

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:40.344
HIGHER CLIP THAN WE WOULD. AND

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:42.279
WITH 40% OF THE MINOR LEAGUERS

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.680
BEING FOREIGN BORN IF WE CANNOT

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.582
COMPETE IN THAT MARKETPLACE

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:48.952
CALIFORNIA CLUBS ARE EXTREMELY

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:53.991
DISADVANTAGED. WELL I I'D HAVE

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.593

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.718
DOESN'T WANT THAT PLAYER WILL

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:57.888
JUST CUT THEM RIGHT SO THAT THE

00:45:57.955 --> 00:45:59.857
OF THE WHOLE PREMISE IS THAT

00:45:59.923 --> 00:46:01.525
AFTER FOUR YEARS THAT YOU ARE

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:03.460
YOU SEEN AS HAVING PROMISED

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:04.027
SOMEWHERE YOU'RE NOT SEEN

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:04.995
HOUSING PROMISE SOMEWHERE THE

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:06.897
PLAN I CAN KEEP YOU AROUND

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:08.098
ANYWAY IF YOU ARE SEEN AS HAVING

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:09.933
PROMISED SOMEWHERE THEN SOMEBODY

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.935
COULD SIGN BUT IT FORCES THAT

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:14.271
ISSUE IN A WAY THAT. SOMEBODY

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:16.507
COULD CONTINUE PLAYING UP UNTIL

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:17.474
SEVEN YEARS AND NOT HAVE THE

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:20.110
ISSUE FORCED AND MAKE IT AND

00:46:20.177 --> 00:46:22.446
THIS FORCES A TEAM TO DECIDE

00:46:22.513 --> 00:46:24.681
AFTER FOR WHEN THEY MIGHT STILL

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:26.783
HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DO IT.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.553
RIGHT I DON'T. NO I THINK IF THE

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.420
CONTENTIOUS SOMEHOW THIS HARMS

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:32.156
PLAYERS BECAUSE- THEY HAVE A

00:46:32.222 --> 00:46:33.957
RIGHT FOR YEARS. I JUST DON'T

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:36.560
THINK IF YOU IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.561

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.011
YEARS WHICH I THINK HE WAS IN

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:55.913
THE MINORS FOR LONGER THAN THAT

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.114
HOW WOULD HE FIT IN THIS

00:46:57.181 --> 00:46:58.782
DISCUSSION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:00.384
WELL UNDER UNDER THIS SITUATION

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:02.152
THE GIANTS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:04.388
SIGN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE TO A

00:47:04.454 --> 00:47:05.355
FOUR YEAR CONTRACT BECAUSE HE

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:07.291
WAS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD PLAYER

00:47:07.357 --> 00:47:07.891
INTERNATIONALLY. AND HE DIDN'T

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:09.526
MAKE IT TO THE MAJORS HE SIGNED

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:11.662
IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WE MADE

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.564
THE MAJORS IN TWO THOUSAND

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.599
EIGHT. SO AFTER FOUR YEARS THEN

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.201
HE WOULD A FREE AGENT AT ANY

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:19.102
TIME ANY TEAM COULD SIGN HIM. US

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.904
WE'D BE COMPETING AGAINST THE

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.839
TWENTY NINE OTHER CLUBS. OF FOR

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.508
HIS SERVICES SO. YOU KNOW IN

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:26.810
THAT SITUATION. PUBLIC SANDOVAL

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:28.679
MIGHT IT NOT HAVE BEEN A GIANT

00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:31.315
IF THIS LEGISLATION PASSES WOOD.

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:34.585
THE- THE OTHER PIECES IS WOULD.

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:36.119
YOU WITH WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:37.888

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:40.257
HAVE CONTINUED AFTER FOUR YEARS

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:42.192
C. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME. THIS

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:44.061
MOVES AHEAD AND SETS A MORE

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:47.531
ARBITRARY THING. AND I HAVEN'T

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:48.832
DETERMINED THAT THAT'S TO THE

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:50.834
ADVANTAGE OF THE PLAYERS THAT

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:52.269
I'M TRYING TO GET AT THAT WITH

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:54.404
THIS. I MEAN YOU'RE SAYING THAT

00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:55.839
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE HE NEVER

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:57.140
WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED IN THE

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:59.042
FIRST PLACE FOR THE MINERS THIS

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:00.510
IS THAT YOUR CONTENTION. RIGHT

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:01.945
MY CONTENTION WOULD BE THAT HE

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:03.313
WOULD BEEN SIGNED BY TEAM

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.682
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA TO A SEVEN

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:07.017
YEAR CONTRACT WHICH FITS THE

00:48:07.084 --> 00:48:08.518
DEVELOPMENT CYCLE BETTER FOR AN

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:10.254
INTERNATIONAL PLAYER. OF IF

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.955
FORCED TO SIGN A PLAYER FOR A

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:14.124
FOUR YEAR CONTRACT. IT MAKES IT

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:15.726
HARDER TO SIGN INTERNATIONAL

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:17.394
PLAYERS. AND DEPENDING ON WHERE

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:19.563
THAT PLAYER IS AT THE END OF

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.163
FOUR YEARS. WHETHER THEY'RE A

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.599
PROSPECT OR NOT THEY MAY WELL BE

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:23.533
A PROSPECT. THEY WOULD HAVE THE

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.935
ABILITY TO GO SIGN WITH ANOTHER

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:30.007
TEAM. AND NOT. THE GIANTS IN A

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:31.441
RELATED GEN I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:34.011
BE BETTER CITY. TO THE- HIS ROOM

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.379
IF W HAVE DIFFERENT ROLES FOR

00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:37.781
CALIFORNIA AND THE OTHER FORTY

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:39.616
NINE STATES. IS THERE PRESSURE

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:42.286
ANOTHER TEAMS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:44.087
OF CALIFORNIA'S RULES IF THEY'RE

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:45.822
DEFERRED AND DISADVANTAGED

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.758
EITHER PLAYERS OR TEAMS AND IF

00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:51.295
BECAUSE- ORIGINALLY. WHEN I READ

00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:53.297
THE ANNOUNCES THAT SAYS ANY THIS

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:54.998
APPLIES TO ANY TEAM THAT PLAYS

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:58.001
IN CALIFORNIA AND SO. THIS WOULD

00:48:58.068 --> 00:48:59.836
APPLY TO ANY TEAM FROM ANOTHER

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:01.838
STATE JUST PLAY HERE RIGHT IS

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:04.441
THAT CORRECT THEM. BECAUSE THE

00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:05.075
THAT SAID THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:07.244
ANALYSIS- I THINK THAT WAS

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:09.646
PRETTY MORE TOWARDS THE A

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:10.847
COMPENSATION OF PIECES SO IN

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:12.015
TERMS OF THE CONTRACT IT WOULD

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:16.520
BE- THERE'S LIVING HERE TEAMS

00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:18.355
BASED HERE. THANKS I WAS TRYING

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:19.990
TO DETERMINE IF THIS

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:22.693
DISADVANTAGES CALIFORNIA. WELL I

00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:23.927
THINK CERTAINLY THAT CONTENTION

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:26.330
WOULD BE YEAH THAT THAT WAS THE

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:29.566
CONTENTION MADE- AND I THINK YOU

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:30.801
KNOW IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:34.404
REALLY HAVE TO SAY AND SAVE- YOU

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:35.939
KNOW WHAT DO WE BELIEVE DO WE

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:37.240
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD SAY. YEAH

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:39.042
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PAYING THESE

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:41.345
POVERTY WAGES BECAUSE OF- THE

00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:43.914
CHANCE THAT MIGHT THAT THAT. YOU

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.682
KNOW THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN

00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:47.584
IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE IT'S NOT

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:48.552
LIKE YOU CAN'T SIGN THESE

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:50.354
PLAYERS FOR THREE MORE YEARS

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.555
RIGHT. OUR POINT IS YOU CAN SEND

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:53.023
ESPECIALLY MORE YEARS YOU YOU

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.591
MAY HAVE TO PAY THEM A HIGHER

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:55.892
SALARY. BUT YOU COULD IF YOU

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:58.628
WANT TO LOCK THEM UP FOR SEVEN

00:49:58.695 --> 00:49:59.296
YEARS YOU CAN SELECT SOME OF FOR

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:00.931
SEVEN YEARS. YOU JUST HAVE TO

00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:04.201
PAY A HIGHER SALARY- SO- THEN

00:50:04.267 --> 00:50:06.536
WHY DO A CONTRACT FOR FOUR YEARS

00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:08.705
IF YOU CAN STILL DO THAT.

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:09.940
BECAUSE THE POINT IS AFTER FOUR

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:12.008
YEARS BECAUSE WAY AND GET THE

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:14.378
WHOLE REASON FOR DOING THIS IS

00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:15.312
YOU YOU HER FOR THE WITNESSES

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:16.513
THE WAGES THAT ARE BEING PAID

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.484
RIGHT NOW. AND AND SO- AFTER

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.619
FOUR YEARS AGAIN HE YOU KNOW THE

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:24.187
CAN YOU HEAR THE WITH US RIGHT

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:26.289
SO IN YOUR EIGHT YEARS DOING THE

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:27.357
EXACT SAME JOB MAKING TWELVE

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:28.792
TIMES AS MUCH. RIGHT TO OUR

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.427
POINT IS YES AFTER FIVE YEARS

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:32.329
YOU CAN BE DOING THE EXACT SAME

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.030
JOB MAKING TWELVE TIMES AS MUCH.

00:50:34.097 --> 00:50:36.466
BUT THAT PRESUMES THAT THERE'S

00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:38.268
ADVANTAGE TO THE PLAYER THAT THE

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:39.669
PLAYERS GOOD ENOUGH IN EVERY

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:42.139
INSTANCE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN AS

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:44.307
OPPOSED TO. VOTE MOVING IT UP

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:45.942
AND BEING MORE ARBITRARY MOVING

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:48.245
IT UP FORCES PEOPLE OUT OF THE

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:49.112
SYSTEM WHEN THEY WOULD NOT AVE

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:50.947
BEEN FORCED OUT OF THE SYSTEM

FOREIGN BORN PLAYERS. THAT ARE

00:50:55.585 --> 00:50:57.287
DISPROPORTIONATELY IN THAT

00:50:57.354 --> 00:51:00.557
CATEGORY THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:01.324
YEAH I DO THINK IF YOU THINK

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:03.126
ABOUT IT THAT THIS NOTION THAT

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:04.127
SOMEHOW IT'S GONNA BE FORCED OUT

IN ORDER LEGISLATION YOU WOULD

UP WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF TEAMS.

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:23.914
IF NOBODY WANTS TO SIGN A AND MY

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.048
BEST OPTIONS STAY FOR THE

SITUATION IF IT'S ENACTED. MY

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.401
UNDERSTANDING IS THE BILL

PROVIDES THAT THERE CAN'T BE A

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:48.071
CONTRACT MORE THAN FOUR YEARS.

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:49.706
SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.308
THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO BRING

00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:53.176
A PLAYER TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:55.078

FOREIGN BORN PLAYERS THAT ARE

SIGNED AT A YOUNGER AGE. COLLEGE

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:07.090
PLAYERS THAT ARE SIGNED. OLDER

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:08.124
THEY HAVE MORE BASEBALL

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.359
EXPERIENCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:10.961
ABLE TO BE A VALUED WITHIN THAT

00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:13.129
TIME FRAME. UNDER UNDER THIS

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:15.465
SCENARIO TWENTY FIVE MAJOR

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:24.975
PLAYERS- AND BECOME MORE

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:26.610
COMPETITIVE THAN THE CALIFORNIA

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:28.778
BASED CLUBS THAT WOULD HAVE TO

00:52:28.845 --> 00:52:29.846
MAKE A DECISION. ON PLAYERS. IN

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.414
MANY CASES WELL BEFORE THAT

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:33.416
DECISION IS RIGHT. SO I JUST

00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:34.951
NEED TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE IF

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:36.686
THAT'S NOT CORRECT. THE BILL

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:37.988
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MINOR LEAGUE

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:39.556
FREE AGENTS ARE PEOPLE WHO LAST

A MINOR LEAGUE FREE AGENT TODAY.

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:50.333
WHICH IS A I BELIEVE. THIS WOULD

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.036
BE AT. AFTER FOUR YEARS RATHER

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:54.671
MINOR LEAGUE FREE AGENCY AFTER

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.306

THEY WENT OFF A- FIRE DEAL. THEY

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:11.187
GOT FOR HER DEAL. THE GIANTS

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:13.023
COULD STILL MATCH THAT AT WORK

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.391
BEAT THAT DEAL- BUT NOT SAYING

YOU GOT FROM A SOMEBODY REMARKS.

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:17.260

PREMISE AND I THINK YOU.

DRESSING SOMETHING ELSE. BECAUSE

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.069
THE PREMISES. THERE'S TWO HERE.

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:27.237
ONE IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'D BE

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:29.239
SIGNED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:31.174
FIRST PLACE. OUR CONVERSATION

00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:32.509
HAS BEEN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:33.910
FOUR YEARS OR SEVEN YEARS. IF

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:35.145
THEY'RE NOT SIGNED IN CALIFORNIA

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:36.947
IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS NO

00:53:37.013 --> 00:53:38.048
FOR YEARS OR THERE IS NO SEVEN

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:40.517
YEARS. BUT THE REAL THING. IS

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:42.686
THERE'S A PRESUMPTION. THAT

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:45.722
PABLO SANDOVAL. FOR THE WITNESS

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:48.258
THAT TESTIFIED. WOULD AT FOUR

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.760
YEARS BE ENTITLED TO THAT OR

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:52.929
RECOGNIZED AS A GOOD PLAYER AND

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:54.598
BE ENTITLED TO THAT. THAT BETTER

00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:57.734
SALARY. A. N. AND THE THING I'M

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.636
TRYING TO GET AT. IS WHETHER

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:02.372
MOVING TO FREE AGENCY MOVES.

00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:04.507
SYSTEM A BIT BECAUSE I DON'T

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:06.977
HAVE ENOUGH LEVERAGE ARE

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:10.013
PERCEIVED TO BE GOOD ENOUGH. A

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.248
CHECK. CHIU SOONER IN A WAY THAT

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:14.084
IS NOT TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.352
PLAYERS YEAH I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:17.520

PLAYER INTO POVERTY WAGES FOR AN

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:23.727
EXTRA THREE YEARS. BECAUSE OF

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.328
THE POSSIBLE EDGE CASE OF

00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:27.130
SOMEBODY IN THE BORDERLINE WHO'S

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:28.765

DISADVANTAGED RIGHT BECAUSE

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:35.739
pFREE AGENT SO IF SOMEBODY WANTS

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:37.173
TO OFFER YOU MORE MONEY. THEN

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.174
YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:40.210
YOU MIGHT SAY HEY ONE SERVICE

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:41.444

AMOUNT. BUT IF NO ONE OFFERS YOU

00:54:44.381 --> 00:54:46.249
MORE MONEY. THEN YOU'RE NO WORSE

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:48.752
OFF YOU CAN STILL STAY WITH THE

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:50.520
CURRENT ORGANIZATION- THAT YOU

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:51.888
EFFORTS TO ME THAT THEY WANT TO

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.823
PAY YOU. IF THEY'RE SIGNED IN

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.191
THE FIRST PLACE. IF THEY'RE

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:56.192
SIGNED A FIRST PLACE YEP. BUT

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:57.961
YET AGAIN THEN YOU'RE NOT

00:54:58.028 --> 00:54:58.495
DISMISSING ANY PLAYERS THE

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.664
QUESTION IS ARE YOU JUST

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:01.598
VANISHING CALIFORNIA TEENS. NINE

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:04.267
ONE. WHAT MADE. IT IN CRAFTING

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:06.903
THE BILL WHAT MADE YOU CHOOSE

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.872
SEVEN YEARS AND FOR I MEAN FOR

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:10.340
YEARS AS OPPOSED TO SEVEN. WHAT

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:12.609
WHAT AND WHAT WAS THE BENCHMARK

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:13.710
FOR DOING WELL BECAUSE WE

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:15.111
BELIEVE THAT FOR IT WE HAD TO

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:17.147
MAKE A CALL BUT WE LIVE FOUR

00:55:17.213 --> 00:55:18.782
YEARS IS SUFFICIENT TO EVALUATE-

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:21.351
A PLAYER. AND SEVEN YEARS I WAS

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:22.552
IN THE CURRENT WEB RIGHT NOW.

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.187
BUT AGAIN JUST. PHYSICALLY SIGN

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:25.355
A PLAYER TO SEVEN YEARS YOU'RE

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:27.157
NOT OBLIGATED. TO KEEP THAT PLAY

00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:28.191
FOR SEVEN YEARS PLAYERS GET CUT

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:30.026
ALL THE TIME. RIGHT SO THAT'S

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:31.361
WHY IT IS NOTION THAT. THEIR

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:32.429
SERVICE EDUCATE FOR SOME IS

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.697
DISADVANTAGED. I JUST DON'T

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:36.599
THINK THAT EDUCATE SUCCESS. UN

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:39.035
BUT THE- YEAH BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:40.970
NOT COMMITTED TO KEEP SOMEONE

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:41.871
FOR SEVEN YEARS SO NOT. YOUR

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:43.273
IT'S NOT A GUARANTEED. YOU KNOW

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:47.143
SAY SEVEN YEAR- EMPLOYMENT- SO

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.112
AGAIN I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY.

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:50.780
IT WILL BE DISADVANTAGING PLAY.

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:51.314
THE QUESTION ARE YOU

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:53.616
DISADVANTAGING CALIFORNIA TEENS.

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:56.286
AND YOU KNOW A HERE IS LIKE I

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:59.322
THINK IT'S UPON US THE SURVEY

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:00.724
DECISION ARE WE GOING TO. STAND

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:04.627
UP FOR WORKERS AND- THE WAY. I

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:05.895
DID CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY I

00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:07.163
THINK TO ME BASED GONNA HAVE TO

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:09.132
ADJUST. THIS IS IT LOOKS LIKE

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:11.367
THEY HAVE TO ADJUST IN IN OTHER

00:56:11.434 --> 00:56:12.368
WAYS AROUND COMPENSATION OTHER

00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:13.970
THINGS- JUST AS WE FOR SAID IN

00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:15.105
MANY OTHER. YOU KNOW WITH MANY

00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:16.439
OTHER PLACES WHERE CALIFORNIA'S

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:18.908
MOVE FIRST AND WE'VE MADE AND-

00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:20.677
THE REST OF COUNTRIES CAUGHT UP

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:22.345
TO US AT YOU KNOW FUEL ECONOMY

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:23.980
WAIVERS OR OTHER THINGS. I THINK

00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:25.348
THAT WERE BIG ENOUGH- THAT THE

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.550
SOLUTION WILL BE FOUND AND YOU

00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:28.985
KNOW I DON'T KNOW NOT TO GO SHE

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:32.756
MAYBE SOME TEACHERS WOULD MAYBE-

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:35.125
YOU KNOW- MAYBE THEY WANT TO

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:36.126
COME UP WITH SOMETHING. ALONG

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:37.627
YOU KNOW FOR SURE. BUT FOR

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:39.596
PLAYERS COMING OUT OF COLLEGE

00:56:39.662 --> 00:56:41.064
BUT- THE REALITIES RIGHT NOW YOU

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:43.099

THE WHICH IS- THAT THAT WE

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.606
IDENTIFIED IN ON JUST READ THOSE

00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:51.274
TO YOU JUST TO BE YOU KNOW NOW

I CAN DO ONE FOLLOW UP ON THE

00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:58.281
SUBJECT. HE I JUST GIVE YOU A

00:56:58.348 --> 00:57:01.251
CHANCE TO COMMENT ON. WHAT WAS

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:02.285
JUST SAID. WELL THERE THERE IS

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:03.887
ANOTHER. HERE THERE'S A RULE

00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:05.388
FIVE DRAFT FOR PLAYERS WITH FOUR

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:06.289
YEARS OF MINOR LEAGUE SERVICE

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:07.891
THAT ANOTHER TEAM CAN. SELECT

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:10.860
THEM- AND TAKE THEM ONTO THEIR

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:12.996
TEAM IF THEY ARE AT THE MAJOR

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:15.765
LEAGUE LEVEL S. IF A PLAYER IS-

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:18.034
AT THE OF THE- HAS THE ABILITY

00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:19.569
TO JUMP TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:20.770
THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:22.906
THEM- IF THEIR CLUB IS. IS

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:26.142
HOLDING THEM BACK PEOPLE OF. AND

00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:28.211
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:31.681
MENTIONING THAT- SO AND THEN

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:33.716
JUST TO EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:35.685
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL AND

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:38.188

ISSUES AND BENEFIT ISSUES- AND

00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:45.094
WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT WILL BE

00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:48.932
PRODUCTIVE I AND- THE MINOR

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:50.500
LEAGUE PLAYERS AND THE LEAKS

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:55.138
WILL HAVE- MODIFIED RUSHING. IN

00:57:55.205 --> 00:57:57.140
IF THERE IS THE COMPENSATION

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:59.108
ISSUES AND BENEFITS ADDRESSED IN

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:01.477
THIS LITIGATION. IT WOULD AFFECT

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:03.513
WHAT THEY'RE PAID WHETHER IT'S

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.182
FOUR YEARS OR SEVEN YES OKAY SO

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:07.317
THAT WOULD ITS ONGOING

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:09.352
LITIGATION THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:10.954
HAPPENING NOW I DON'T WANT TO

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.022
PRE JUDGE THEM- BUT WE BELIEVE

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:15.058
THAT THOSE SHOULD. BE GIVEN THE

00:58:15.124 --> 00:58:19.162

DEAD THAT THE COMPENSATION AND

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:52.595
BENEFITS SHOULD BE REALLY CLEAR

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:54.130
RATHER THAN IT BE OFF TO THE

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:56.599
SIDE IN SOME WAY. IS THAT

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:58.902

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:22.458
THE LITIGATION YES MA'AM. IN.

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:23.459
THE END WE- CLOSE OUR- OUR GONNA

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:25.295
CHIU THIS. THE AB RIGHT WHICH I

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:27.230
THINK GIVES OUR WITNESS WE HAVE

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.399
TREVOR SPEAK ON. ON A SOME OF

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:31.434
THESE QUESTIONS TO ABOUT FOUR

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:32.368
YEARS FOR SEVEN YEARS IF HE

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:33.336
THINKS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:39.108
DISADVANTAGED. BY BY- I THINK HE

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:41.444
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S- THE YOU

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:43.112
KNOW WE COULD HAVE EVERY SINGLE

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:44.881
PLAYER. I TESTIFY I THINK IT'S A

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:47.116
MORE GENERIC QUESTION THAT THAN

00:59:47.183 --> 00:59:48.818
THE INDIVIDUAL ONE I WANT TO

00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:50.053
CHANGE THE SUBJECT. TWENTY NINE

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:51.854
NO I BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.823
BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE IS THE

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:55.058
NAME IN IT IMAGE AND LIKENESS.

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:57.060
IN DIRT THE THING THAT WAS

00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:59.095
RAISED IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND I

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:01.564
WANT YOU TO SPEAK TO IT. IT IS

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:07.437
THAT. A TEAM LOSES CONTROL OF-

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:08.871
THE WHAT A PLAYER MIGHT SAY

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:11.374
ABOUT THE CLUB OR THE GAME IF

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:16.746
IT'S INDEPENDENT HOW. WOULD THIS

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:17.413
BILL ADDRESS THAT ARE NOT

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.449
ADDRESS THAT. YES A- WE FEEL

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:23.119
THAT'S- PRETTY CLEAR THAT YOU

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:24.354
AGREEMENT CAN BE REACHED AT

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.422
PLAYERS AND OWNERS VIA THE UPC

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:28.224
IN TERMS OF WHAT TYPES OF

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.892
PRODUCTS THAT CAN CAN BE

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.327
ENDORSED I'M JUSTWITH THE NCAA

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.162
RIGHT D. THAT PLAYERS HAVE AN

01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:34.731
IMAGE LIKENESS WE DON'T LET

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:37.900
PLAYERS- GO AND ENDORSE YOU KNOW

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.168
CIGARETTES OR OTHER THINGS RIGHT

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:42.005
SO- THE ADMISSION OF YOUR

01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:43.339
QUESTIONS BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:45.308
SORT OF LIKE I THINK WHAT I

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.677
HEARD. IS THAT THE TEAMS FEEL

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.679
LIKE THEY LOSE CONTROL OF THE

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.047
MESSAGE IS THERE A WAY WITHIN

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:52.382
YOUR BILL THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:53.916
BUT THEY HAVE TO GET REWARDED

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.152
FOR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS YES

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.787
AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.422
DOCUMENTED AND THAT THEY CAN

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:00.823
CONTINUE NEGOTIATE JUST OTHER

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:03.126
PLACES RIGHT THEY CAN BE ABLE TO

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.293
NEGOTIATE THAT THERE'S NOTHING

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.628
THAT HARMS A MAJOR LEAGUE

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:07.196
BASEBALL. I MEAN IT'S NOT

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:08.865
REQUIRED IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.233
THEY WOULD NEGOTIATE ON EVERY

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:13.669
SITUATION YES AND I WOULD PREFER

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:16.806
TO- I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:17.807
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THE BILL

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:22.145
YES- IT ACCORDING TO. THE PEOPLE

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:25.615
THAT WE'VE TALKED TO- AROUND US

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:27.683
IT'S REALLY ABOUT MAKING CAN SO

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.085
WE TOOK A VIDEO GAME EXAMPLE

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.087
WHERE THEY CURRENTLY DO NOT GET

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.423
COMPENSATED FOR THAT- BUT THE

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:34.590
OTHER PIECE. EXACT MECHANICS

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.292
AKIN TO THE EXACT MECHANICS

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:37.894
HERE- FOR THIS PURPOSE OF THIS

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.596
DISCUSSION THERE ARE MECHANICS

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:44.200
TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU CAN'T SAY

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:45.668
NEGOTIATE FOR CIGARETTES OR YOU

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:48.004
CAN'T DO SUPPORT FOR GAMBLING I

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:50.073
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING. I JUST

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.407
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:52.842

BELIEVE IT IS PROHIBITED NOW AND

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.126
I DON'T BELIEVE OUR BILL CHANGE

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:14.263
YES. ONE OFFICER TO WALKING TO

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.165
THE MICHAEL ASK YOU TO COMMENT

OF SENATOR DRAWS. YEAH. THE

01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:36.986
THING ABOUT THE BILL THAT'S

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.187
INTERESTING IS THAT IT HAS ONE

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.322
PROVISION THAT IS ALL

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:40.957
ENCOMPASSING AND USES THE WORD

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:45.094
INTERFERES. A CONTRACT CANNOT IT

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.162
THE BILL ACTUALLY SAYS A

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:48.598
CONTRACT CANNOT HAVE A PROVISION

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:49.265
THAT INTERFERES WITH THE

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.434
PLAYER'S. NAME IMAGE AND

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.070
LIKENESS RIGHT. THERE'S NO

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.371
DEFINITION OF WHAT INTERFERES

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.507
MEANS THE BILL THAT PURPORTS TO

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.442
GO ON TO GIVE THE CLUB SOME SORT

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:03.012
OF. RIGHT THAT IS A VERY

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:05.581
SPECIFIC ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:07.650
CONFLICTS BETWEEN WHAT THE

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:08.818
PLAYERS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:11.187
CLUBS TRYING TO DO. THAT IS BY

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.489
THE WAY BY A MUCH BROADER WAY

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.491
MUCH BROADER STANDARD THE

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.827
INTERFERES STANDARD. AN WHAT'S

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:19.529
IN THE MAJOR LEAGUE UNIFORM

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:20.730
PLAYER CONTRACT WHICH

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:22.732
SPECIFICALLY GIVES THE RIGHT.

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:25.768
THE CLUBS THE RIGHT TO REVIEW

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:28.037
AND APPROVE- THE USE OF NAME

01:03:28.104 --> 01:03:29.939
IMAGE AND LIKENESS. UNDER

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:33.075
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES CHAU.

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.911
THAT'S WHY WE OPPOSE THE

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:36.779
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AS IT IS

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.548
TODAY. AND I SHOULD POINT OUT AS

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:40.783
I DID EARLIER THE CURRENT MINOR

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:41.884
LEAGUE YOU UNIFORMED PLAYER

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:44.320
CONTRACT DOES NOT DEPRIVE A

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:47.490
PLAYER OF HIS AND I ALL RIGHTS

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.959
IT SIMPLY REQUIRES. THAT THE

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.595
CLUB REVIEW AND APPROVE THAT SO

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.765
THAT IT THEIR PROPERLY USED. IN

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:56.966
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE PROPOSING

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.301
SOMETHING DO HELLO ONE LAST

01:03:58.367 --> 01:03:59.502
QUESTION YOU'RE PROPOSING

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:01.504
SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO YOU DON'T

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.906
THINK THAT WORKS- THIS IS

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:05.741
EXACTLY THE NCA SITUATION THIS

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.376
IS REALLY WELL DOCUMENTED VERY

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:08.344
EASY TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:12.248
ANY- CERTAINLY- WE'RE NOT GONNA

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.950
DO ANYTHING WE MADE IT VERY

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:14.984
CLEAR. THAT WOULD GIVE THE BY

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:17.053
BUT I'VE READ I ASKED A

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.221
DIFFERENT QUESTION BIG BIG

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:19.055
BECAUSE THEY STATED THE WHITE

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.590
ITS OPERATING AND YOUR BILL

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.225
CHANGES THE WAY IT'S OPERATING

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.926
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE WAY

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:28.197
IT'S OPERATING NOW NEEDS TO BE

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.899
CHECKED. WHAT WE THINK IT'S NEED

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:30.967
TO CHECK. THE BILL CHANGES FROM

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:33.102
WHAT HE SAID. THE COST REGARDING

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:34.971
AND IT. DOESN'T IT STATE'S

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.172
PLAYERS WILL NOT MAKE PUBLIC

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.440
APPEARANCES PARTICIPANT RATER

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:38.808

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:39.809
FORMS OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:42.245
CONFERENCES OR ANY SUPPORT. SO

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:43.346
WE BELIEVE THAT A PERSON FROM

PROFITING FROM VIDEO GAMES. AND

01:04:45.414 --> 01:04:46.682
OTHER ITEMS OUTSIDE THEIR JOB

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.784
RESPONSIBILITIES. AND YEAH

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:49.352
THAT'S WHICH I CHANGE THAT

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.454
SMELLS ABOUT. SENATOR I WOULD

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.856
ASK SENATOR BACKER TO FINISH

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:55.258

THE NCAA SITUATION. WE'RE NOT

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:05.768
GONNA DO ANYTHING- THAT- YOU

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:06.969
KNOW THAT THIS IS THE SORT OF

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:10.139
WELL DOCUMENTED PIECE. AND WE

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:11.540
CAN IF THERE'S ANY CLEAR PRIMACY

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.809
BE TAKEN WE CAN TAKE UP. BUT THE

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:16.245
REALITY IS WE HAVE PLAYERS I'M

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:17.046
STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:18.881
THAT DOESN'T WORK AND WHY YOU

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:20.082
FEEL LIKE IT HAS TO CHANGE IT

CHANCE TO WORK IT OUT AND I'M

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.133
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER

THERE'S- SOMETHING HERE THAT CAN

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:14.603

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.947
THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:26.849
THAT WE DO BILLS ALL THE TIME

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.651
JUST LOOK AT THE ENERGY

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:29.452
DEREGULATION IT WAS SORT OF

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.187
CLEAR HERE'S OUR VALUES HERE SO

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:32.621
WE HAVE TO DO. THE CONSEQUENCES

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:34.423
WERE SO ON INTENDED THAT WE

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.926
DON'T WITH THEM FOR YEARS AND SO

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:38.294
I GET WHAT OUR VALUES ARE OUR

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:40.162
VALUES ARE REALLY CLEAR YOU'RE

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:42.331
ACTING OUT OF THE VALUES BUT I

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:43.399
CAN'T TELL IF WHAT THE BILL

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:45.968
DOES. MATCHES THAT AND DOESN'T

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.870
HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:49.939
ISN'T MUCH BROADER THAN IT

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:52.608
SHOULD BE SO THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.976
STRUGGLING WITH IN THE EARLY YOU

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:56.779
CAN DEAL WITH IT IN THE CLUB.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.148

CONVERSE CENTER NEWMAN DO YOU

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:03.786
HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.254
I DO AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.690
LATE INTO FIND. IF ANY THIS IS

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:08.257
DUPLICATIVE I APOLOGIZE IN

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:10.893
ADVANCE. I WANT TO COME BACK TO

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.796
THIS DISCUSSION OF- SEVEN USERS

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.131
FOR YEARS TO PLAY CONTROL AT THE

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:17.299
FOR MR BERGAN SEEMS VERY. AND I

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:19.668
DON'T KNOW IF YOU MENTIONED OR

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:20.302
TALKED ABOUT SIGNING BONUSES THE

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:22.571
AND THEIR IMPACT. ON NOT OLY

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:24.039
THE BUSINESS MODEL GENERALLY BUT

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:25.875
ON HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE.

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:27.443
YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IN THOSE

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:28.911
FOREIGN SEVEN AND HOW IT MIGHT

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:30.479
INFLUENCE YOUR- TREATMENT OF

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.214
TALENT- IF THAT WOULD CHANGE.

01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:33.816
THE LOOK OF A WITNESS ADDRESS IT

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.284
AFTERWARDS OKAY BECAUSE HE WAS

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:37.019
NOT HERE FOR THAT. YEAH I CAN I

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.188
CAN TELL YOU IN TWO THOUSAND ONE

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:40.389
THE AVERAGE SIGNING BONUS WAS

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:42.057
THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:43.225
THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER PLAYER BUT

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:44.360
THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:46.829
PLAYERS IT'S A RANGE- FROM

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:50.866
FAIRLY LOW. VERY VERY HIGH

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:52.268
FIGURE. SO THAT'S THE ARAB.

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:53.469
SIGNING BONUS FOR A PLAYER SO

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:55.304
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY PART OF THE

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:55.938
CONSIDERATION THE PLAYERS ARE.

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:58.073
LEARNING JOURNEY TO BE CLEAR I

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.975
MEAN YOU KNOW ON AVERAGE. A

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.377
PLAYER INJURED PLAYERS GETTING

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:03.045
SOME OUTSIDE OF US. AND THAT'S

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:04.480
BEING ADVERTISED ACROSS THE

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:07.483
LENGTH OF TEAM CONTROL. RIGHT SO

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.718
YOU KOW TO SOME EXTENT THEY MAY

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:11.821
BE- YOU TAKE A CHANCE ON THEIR

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:13.456
JOB THEY HAVE RECEIVED SOME

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:14.857
COMPENSATION IN ADVANCE- AND

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.459
THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SOME OF

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:19.462
THE TOWN THAT YOU WISH YOU

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:20.062
SEARCHES YOU MAKE CORRECT. YES

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.430
OBVIOUSLY THE PLAYERS THAT ARE

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:24.533
PERCEIVED AS- MORE TALENTED A

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.702
RECEIVE. HIGHER SIGNING BONUSES

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.471
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:31.507
ACROSS THE BOARD IT DEPENDS ON-

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:33.075
YOU KNOW ARE THEY COLLEGE PLAYER

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.477
OR THEY HIGH SCHOOL PLAYER AND

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:36.312
THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABLES AT

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:37.746
PLAY. SURE IF YOU'RE DURATION

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:39.615
YOUR CONTROLS LIMIT OF FOUR

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:42.618
YEARS WITH THAT CHANGE. HOW YOU

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:43.219
WOULD APPROACH THE BONUSES IF

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:45.154
YOU HAD. LESS LESS TIME TO

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:47.122
EVALUATE TALENTLESS TIME TO THE

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.824
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT. I THINK

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:50.826
CLUBS WOULD BE LOW TO SIGN

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:52.928
PLAYERS FOR HIGH SIGNING BONUSES

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:54.029
THAT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:55.931
PLAYER WOULD BE READY TO PLAY IN

01:08:55.998 --> 01:08:57.099
THE MAJORS WITHIN THE FOUR YEAR

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:58.400
TIME FRAME. WHICH WOULD MEAN

01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:01.437
THAT INTERNATIONAL LEE- FOREIGN

01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:02.605
BORN PLAYERS FOR HIGH SCHOOL

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.473
PLAYERS WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.143
BE SIGNED. AND LESS LIKELY TO BE

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:08.744
SIGNED FOR. HIGHER SIGNING

01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:10.746
BONUSES. PRECIADO TO SERVE THANK

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.014
YOU OR CLARIFYING SO COMING

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.449
BACK TO THE AND I'LL DISCUSSION

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:15.518
OF WITH THE FLEET OKAY. CAN I

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:17.353
DON'T KNOW GOOD SIR. NOPE BUT

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:19.088
SENATE RECORD BUDGET DID HER

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.089
WITNESS OF THE BECAUSE THERE

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:22.291
WITNESS FOR NOT INVESTMENT JUST

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:24.159
SO YOU KNOW. SO THE FULL LENGTH

01:09:24.226 --> 01:09:26.362
OFTHE PC PLAYERS TO PAY FOR PER

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:29.164
WEEK AT THE COMPLEX WE LEVEL.

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:30.032
FIVE HUNDRED PER WEEK A SINGLE A

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:32.234
LEVEL SIX HUNDRED PER WEEK IT'S

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:36.839
AVAILABLE. WE AT DOUBLE A. OF

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.073
THESE ARE NOT WHO ARE GET. BIG

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.608
SIGNING BONUSES SO I WOULDN'T

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.110
EXPECT- THAT THAT THREE THREE OF

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.878
THE AVERAGE CAN BE MISSED. SO IT

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:44.914
TWENTY FIVE POINT IT WOULD BE

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.081
GOOD TO HEAR FROM OUR WITNESS-

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:47.616

IT'S GOING TO BE THE THINKCENTRE

01:09:58.661 --> 01:09:59.595
LATER COVERED A LOT OF THIS- THE

01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:03.265
QUESTION AROUND AND- I. L.

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:06.101

FERNANDES AND SOAK IT MAY AS I

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.173
UNDERSTAND IT MAY BE TRUE FOR

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.141
VIDEO GAMES BUT IT'S REALLY NOT

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:14.109
TRUE FOR OTHER. APPLICATIONS ARE

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.377
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT MIGHT

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:16.712

FOR NAME IMAGE LIKENESS DEALS.

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:20.349
WELL THE ISSUE WHEN AND I'LL THE

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:22.818
NC DOUBLE A ISSUE WAS THAT THE

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:26.121
PLAYERS HAVE NO RIGHTS. I AS I

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:33.295

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:51.213
SECOND PART. IS THE PART THAT

USE. OF THE PLAYERS- AND I ALL

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:02.324
RIGHT. BUT THE PROVISION ITSELF

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.259
PRESERVES THE PLAYERS AND I ALL

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.861
RIGHTS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.563

WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SURE

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:31.240
THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE- ROBUST

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:33.776
DISCUSSION AND- ENGAGEMENT AND

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:36.211
THAT WAS FOR THAT CENTER ARCHER

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:38.213
HERE- BECAUSE HE'S APPRECIATE

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.415
HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR- TEAM I

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:44.052
THINK THAT THE QUESTION IS- IF

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:46.822
WE BELIEVE IN ANY WAY THAT. THAT

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.690
FORCED TO CONTROL. THE PLAYERS

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:50.459
TO BE CONTROLLED FOR SEVEN YEARS

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.194
IS SOMEHOW IN THEIR BEST

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.864
INTEREST. I THINK THAT IS A- IS-

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:57.833
KIND OF CLEARLY A LAUGHABLE-

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.569
PROPOSITION- SO I THINK THAT THE

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:01.837
QUESTION HERE IS YOU KNOW

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:03.205
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE TEAMS ARE

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.706
CONCERNED FOR THEIR-

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.542
COMPETITIVENESS. I THINK THAT.

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.143
YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S AN

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.711
OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA LEAD

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.780
AND I THINK THE RIGHT THING WILL

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.649
FOLLOW. UN IF THAT WERE TO

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.350
SOMEHOW- NOT HAPPENED THIS PAST

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.518
AND WE FOUR YEAR CONTRACTS IN

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:19.054
THAT AND SUCH. AGAIN PLAYER YOU

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.422
KNOW TEAMS HERE CAN STILL SIGN

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:21.957
SOMEONE FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:23.592
YEARS OF HER LIFE SO I JUST

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:25.160
THINK IT ANY ANY PROPOSITION

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:27.229
THAT SOMEHOW. CHANGING THIS I

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:28.931
MEAN AGAIN I'M SURE I WAS NOT

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.866
AROUND FREE AGENCY BUT I'M SURE

01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:32.067
THE EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS WERE

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:33.802
MADE HOW THIS THE FRIDGE SHE WAS

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:36.672
GETTING ATTACHMENT- SOMEHOW- TO

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:40.709
THE PLAYERS- AND- YOU KNOW AND-

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:42.010
LUCKILY YOU KNOW I THINK

01:14:42.077 --> 01:14:44.446
PREVAILED AND- I'LL GET THE KERR

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:45.514
FLIGHT CASE AND WE HAVE. A FREE

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:48.550
AGENCY UN SO I THINK THAT'S

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:49.484
REALLY THAT THE KEY POINT HERE

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:51.820
IS WE BELIEVE THAT ALLOWING

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:52.688
PLAYERS TO CONTROL IN SEVEN

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:55.023
YEARS. AT THE SALARIES THAT WE

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:57.626
ARE NOW WITH THE SIGNING BONUS

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:58.393
THAT WE HEARD IT'S PROBABLY ON

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.997
AVERAGE- IS IN THE PLAYER'S BEST

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:05.767
INTEREST NO. CLEARLY IT'S NOT.

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.636
QUESTION ARE WE WILLING TO. A

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:08.270
STEP FOR. IF THERE'S ISSUES AND

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.972
I OUT WERE HAPPY TO LOOK AT

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:11.874
THEM. THAT WE KNOW THERE'S THIS

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.508
GAME FOR EXAMPLE THEY DON'T GET

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:15.277
PAID FOR- BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.311
ALLOW THEM TO GO OUTSIDE YOU

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:17.980
KNOW THERE WILL STILL BE. I'M

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:19.748
SURE I JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.049
WAYS TO. MAKE SURE AND I THINK

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:23.218
THAT I DON'T THINK A BILL

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:25.087
CHANGES THAT- WHERE TEAMS CAN

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:29.458

TO MAKE SURE IS NO DAMAGE TO THE

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:32.661
BRAND TEAM. SO I THINK THAT'S

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.630
NOT AN ISSUE. AND AGAIN I

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:35.430

TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:19.740
PARTICULARLY NEEDED WHEN WE

OPPORTUNITIES. WELL YES- THE

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.694
BASIC POINT IS THAT WE DON'T

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.862
HAVE THE FOCUS AT THE STATE

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:44.065

THAT WE DO HAVE FOR WORKFORCE

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:50.271
TRAINING WE'RE NOT REALLY

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:53.140
FOCUSED ON YOUTH AND SO IF IT IF

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:54.976
FUNDS GET OUT THERE INTO YOUTH

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:57.078

ORGANIZED WAY OF GETTING THE

FUNDS TO THE YOUTH PROGRAM SO

01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:02.116
THAT'S THE MAIN PURPOSE IS THAT%

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:04.218
WE HAVE A STATE LEVEL- YOUTH

01:32:04.285 --> 01:32:06.320
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. THAT

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:10.057
WILL REALLY- FOCUS AND MAKE SURE

01:32:10.124 --> 01:32:11.559
THAT FUNDING AND ADEQUATE

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:14.695
FUNDING IS GOING INTO OUR YOUTH

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:53.393
QUESTION- SENATOR CORTESE NOT

01:53:58.131 --> 01:54:00.200
READING IN MY NOTES THAT-

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:01.768
THERE'S THE PENALTIES THAT ARE

01:54:01.834 --> 01:54:04.304
BEING ASSESSED- IN CASE OF A

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:07.273

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.508
AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS WOULD

01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:10.843
WORK IN THIS ENVIRONMENT BUT IS

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:12.679
THERE ARE- RIGHT TO CURE. THE

01:54:12.745 --> 01:54:14.447
PERIOD OF TIME WHERE PEOPLE

01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:15.315

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:18.751
AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN THE- THE

01:54:18.818 --> 01:54:21.454
PENALTIES ASSESSED HERE- YOU

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:23.122
KNOW WE HAVE TURNED OVER IN THE

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:26.759
BILL- THE WORK TO PROMULGATE THE

01:54:26.826 --> 01:54:28.595
ACTUAL REGULATIONS THAT WOULD

01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:30.063
THAT WOULD TRIGGER CODE

01:54:30.129 --> 01:54:31.931
ENFORCEMENT VIOLATIONS- TO CAL

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:34.267
OSHA. BUT I'M HAPPY AS WE GO

01:54:34.334 --> 01:54:37.237
FORWARD TO- TO GET MORE CLARITY

01:54:37.303 --> 01:54:39.038
ON THAT TO REPORT BACK TO YOUR

01:54:39.105 --> 01:54:40.940
OFFICE DIRECTLY BUT ALSO TO MAKE

01:54:41.007 --> 01:54:42.775
SURE ANYONE ELSE IN THE

01:54:42.842 --> 01:54:44.043
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BETTER

01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:46.512
UNDERSTAND- WHAT THE COMPLIANCE

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:48.514
PROCESS WOULD WOULD LOOK LIKE

01:54:48.581 --> 01:54:51.217
WITH- AN OSHA OFFICER SHOWS UP

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:53.453
ON THE SET. WHO TYPICALLY WITH

01:54:53.519 --> 01:54:54.687
CODE ENFORCEMENT VIOLATIONS OF

01:54:54.754 --> 01:54:56.923
THAT NATURE OF ANY NATURE IN THE

01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:59.459
IN THE WORKFORCE- THERE'S A

01:54:59.525 --> 01:55:00.460
COMPLIANCE ORDER THIS IS

01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:02.428
CORRECT. OR ELSE YOU'LL BE FINE

01:55:02.495 --> 01:55:04.230
WE'LL GET CLARITY ON THAT REPORT

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:06.566
BACK TO YOU. IT'S A VERY MUCH I

01:55:06.633 --> 01:55:08.001
THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:10.003
THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE

01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:11.804
SCARE OFF THE- MOVIE INDUSTRY.

01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:13.873
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE SO WHEN WE

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.475
HAVE FINES THAT CAN BE EXTREMELY

01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:17.210
EXPENSIVE AND WE DON'T KNOW YOU

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:19.012
KNOW HOW PROBLEMATIC THEY WOULD

01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:21.414
BE I MEAN I DON'T KNOW- BUT I

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.716
JUST I ALWAYS LIKE TO. GIVE

01:55:23.783 --> 01:55:24.651
EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:55:24.717 --> 01:55:27.654
ABLE TO- ADDRESS AN ISSUE OR A

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.322
CONCERN PRIOR TO BEING YOU KNOW

01:55:29.389 --> 01:55:32.125
FINAL. PENALIZE BASICALLY

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:33.226
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:55:33.293 --> 01:55:35.795
FINANCIAL- OPPORTUNITIES BUT I

01:55:35.862 --> 01:55:37.363
THINK SAFETY IS OF THE UTMOST

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:40.433
CONCERN AND THE OTHER QUESTION I

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.001
HAVE- IN YOUR OPINION THERE'S

01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:43.736
ANOTHER BILL THAT WE SUPPORTED.

01:55:43.803 --> 01:55:45.271
THAT I SUPPORTED AN ANSWER I

01:55:45.338 --> 01:55:46.572
THINK WE ALL DID- WITH SENATOR

01:55:46.639 --> 01:55:50.810
PORTANTINO'S BILL- HOW WOULD YOU

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:52.412
. SORT OF COMPARE YOUR BILL WITH

01:55:52.478 --> 01:55:56.149
WITH HIS BILL. I THINK THE MAIN

01:55:56.215 --> 01:55:57.050
OF WAR ONE OF THE MAIN

01:55:57.116 --> 01:55:59.285
DIFFERENCES AND I HAVEN'T- I

01:55:59.352 --> 01:56:00.953
