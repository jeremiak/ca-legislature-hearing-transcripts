AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:14.133
AND WHAT WHAT I AM COMMITTED TO

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:17.803
SUPPORTING IS- FOR WORKERS TO BE

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.905
EMPOWERED TO COME TOGETHER AND-

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:22.241
I MAKE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:23.675
WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:26.278

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:51.537
AND SO THAT IS REALLY WHAT OUR

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.572
PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO GET INTO

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:56.442
ENSURE THAT WORKERS. HAVE A

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:36.041
THE STANDARD PROCESS OF THE L.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:38.076

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:08.974
BY. I IT WAYS I BELIEVE IN

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.210
TWENTY EIGHTEEN- WHEN DOES THE

IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT THAT

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:30.596
THEY WERE IMPOUNDED AND I DON'T

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:31.463
BELIEVE THE INITIAL ELECTION

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.131
HAPPENED AND IN THE FALL OF

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:34.366

SPENT ON- THE REQUIRING THESE IN

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:46.311
IMMIGRANT FARM WORKERS IN THE

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:47.813
CENTRAL VALLEY TO GO THROUGH

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:50.382
THIS PROCESS- THE LENGTH OF TIME

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:55.821
THAT THEY DID. NO I DO NOT. OKAY

00:20:55.887 --> 00:20:56.822
ESTIMATES THAT I HAVE BEEN

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:58.256
DOCUMENTS I HAVE SHOW IT'S OVER

00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:00.092
TEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.693
WAS SPENT CAN YOU TELL ME F

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.595
THERE'S ANY MONEY BEING SPENT-

00:21:03.662 --> 00:21:07.165
ON THIS PROCESS NOW. BUT LIKE I

00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:11.436
SAID THAT CASE WAS CONCLUDED-

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:14.339
AND SO I'M NOT AWARE THAT THAT

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:15.474
IF THERE IS ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.409
BEING SPENT ON THE PROCESS THAT

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.544
SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO THE

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:21.913
ELECTION AND THE VALIDITY OF THE

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.450
ELECTION THERE THERE'S I THINK-

00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:27.052
AN ONGOING CASE INVOLVING

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:32.124
GROWING FARMING- BUT BUT THAT

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.092
THAT'S IN THE REMEDY PHASE SO

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:35.127
JUST TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:38.430
REMEDIES NOT NOT SPECIFIC TO THE

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:40.399
VALIDITY OF ELECTIONS- ARE YOU

00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:42.467
REFERRING TO THE- THAT AND FOR

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:44.069
LABOR PRACTICE THAT WAS FILED BY

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.937
EIGHTY- ONE OF THE MINORITY

IS THAT THE CASE YOU'RE TALKING

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:54.446
ABOUT. THE STILL ONGOING HI

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:56.415
THERE IS THERE IS A CASE WHERE

00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:58.183
THERE WAS A FINAL BOARD DECISION

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.619
ISSUED AS TO LIABILITY AND IT

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:03.522
WAS CONCLUSIVELY ADJUDICATED-

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:07.025
THAT. THAT THEY ARE WRONG WAS

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:09.127
LIABLE FOR SOMEONE FOR LABOR

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:11.430
PRACTICES. AND RIGHT NOW WHAT'S

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:12.898
WHAT'S PENDING THROUGH THE L.

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:15.133
BAHASA SEEDS INSTANCE TO

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:15.934
DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.369
REMEDIES- TO THE WORKER SAID

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:20.572
THAT IT THAT IS WHY IT'S

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:21.173
ACTUALLY PENDING SO THAT. THE

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:22.107
CASE INVOLVING LIABILITIES

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:23.975
SPANISH AND WERE IN THE REMEDY

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:25.243
PHASE OF THAT MAKES SENSE IT

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.813
DOES MAKE SENSE I. THINK THERE'S

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:29.347
ONE MORE CASEAND I COULD BE

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:31.983
WRONG. BUT THERE WAS A- OF ONE

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.887
OF THE FEW UNION WORKERS AT RON-

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:37.889

THAT BE JUST AN EXTENSION OF THE

00:46:58.182 --> 00:46:59.416
BUREAUCRACY PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.018
BUT- IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED

00:47:01.084 --> 00:47:03.120
VERY WELL- WHEN WE HAD MANY

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:06.323

SENATOR I THINK THAT IT'S A

00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:17.734
REALLY INTERESTING IDEA AND IN

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:20.470
FACT THAT THAT IS A WALL THAT

00:47:20.537 --> 00:47:22.272
DATE- WELL IN TERMS OF JUST A

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.708
PROVIDING. INFORMATION RESOURCES

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:27.778
THAT IT'S A ROLE THAT I THINK

00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:28.745
SOME OF OUR STAFF HAVE. STILL I

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.781
DON'T KNOW IF I CLICK ON BUTTON

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:32.449

PEOPLE IN GETTING WHERE THEY

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:38.989
NEED TO GO. AND SO WE HAVE WE

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:42.259
HAVE. BEEN WORKING TO. ACHIEVE

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:44.528
THAT AND- THAT'S BEEN WHAT WE'VE

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:47.831
BEEN DOING- SINCE WE- SINCE

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:49.333

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:50.867
HUNDRED NUMBER A LITTLE MORE

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:53.237
BROADLY- TO FARMWORKERS. BUT I

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:54.671
THINK CERTAINLY THERE'S A

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:57.741
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER MODELS-

00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:00.510
IDEAS THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:02.746
EXPLORED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:05.215
FARMWORKERS CAN. AND GET THE

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:07.618
HELP THEY NEED WHEN THEY CONTACT

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:08.819
SOMEBODY. AND THEY DON'T WORK

FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:14.458

00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:15.225
IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:17.194

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:20.464
STAKEHOLDERS ON. BOTH SIDES OF

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.299
AN ISSUE WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:24.134
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY- LAST

00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:27.070
QUESTION- THERE IS A QUESTION OF

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:28.605
WHETHER THERE IS A FIREWALL IF

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:30.507
YOU WILL BETWEEN YOUR DECISIONS

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:32.142
SANDALS OF THE BOARD. SINCE

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:33.310

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:37.214
DIVISIONS WITH HANNAH- LRB AND-

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:38.849

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:56.133
LIKE THERE'S AN INTEGRATION OF

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:57.267
STAFF. AND I MIGHT THAT NOT BE

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:59.202
YOU MIGHT NOT BE CORRECT BUT

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:00.337
THAT'S HOW IN READING THE

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:02.572
BACKGROUND IT SEEMS THAT YOU

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:06.510

SOMETIMES THAT ARE BASED ON

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:28.044
CIRCUMSTANCES OUTSIDE OF OUR

00:52:28.111 --> 00:52:29.913
CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW

MIGRATORY- THE WORK IS SEASONAL

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:36.653

SOMETIMES THAT'S JUST ONE

00:52:48.398 --> 00:52:49.900
EXAMPLE OF WHAT MIGHT DELAY A

00:52:49.966 --> 00:52:52.335
CASE AND SO THERE ARE SOME

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:54.070
CIRCUMSTANCES OUT OF OUR CONTROL

00:52:54.137 --> 00:52:55.272
BUT BUT FOR THOSE WITHIN OUR

CONTROL I AM VERY COMMITTED. TO

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:02.679
ENSURING THAT THAT WE- BOB DO

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:04.347

AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE SO

00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:09.386
THAT WE CAN GET A SWIFT

00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:12.322
RESOLUTION TO THESE MATTERS

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:13.390
THAT'S IN THE INTEREST OF

00:53:13.456 --> 00:53:16.860
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR THAT I

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:17.460
JUST BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.995
THINK THE COMMENTS FROM MY

00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:19.963
COLLEAGUES I WAS VERY INVOLVED

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.198
WITH THE- THE FARMWORKERS IN HER

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:24.968
DISTRICT I THINK THE DELAY IN A

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:27.737
DECISION BY YOUR- PARTICULAR-

00:53:27.804 --> 00:53:30.574
DIVISION. JEFF SOMETIMES THAT

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.742
THERE EVEN A FIREWALL. THE THREE

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:34.377
OF THE INSTITUTIONAL BIAS IN

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.979
DOUBT ABOUT BEING THE FINAL

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:37.213
DECISION COULD BE INFLUENCED BY

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.115
THAT. SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:40.584
THAT I'LL BE PAYING ATTENTION TO

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:41.718
AND APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS TO

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:44.688
THAT. HI I THINK YOUR GOAL IS TO

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:48.391
ENSURE THAT THE AGENCY- HAS THE

00:53:48.458 --> 00:53:50.527
HIGHEST LEVEL OF CREDIBILITY TO

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:51.995
ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.096
PRODUCING OUR FOOD IN THE

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:54.898
VALLEY. AND BEYOND AND I THINK

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:56.800
THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK

00:53:56.866 --> 00:53:59.669
TO BE DONE ON THAT FRONT IN

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:00.203
TERMS OF THE CONFIDENCE.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.271
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HEAR COMMENTS

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:03.039
THAT THEIR SON ATTEMPT TO DO A

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:06.409

OTHER WORDS THAT AGRICULTURAL

AND SOMETHING HAPPENED AS A

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:23.313
RESULT. THEN IT IT COULD BE ANY

00:56:23.379 --> 00:56:24.948
IT COULD BE ANY KIND OF TOPIC

PERMANENT HOUSING COULD HANDLE

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:44.400
AS WELL BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:49.773
THAT THE L. R. B. IS LOOKING AT

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:52.475
WHETHER- YOUR WET. WHETHER THEY

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:55.345

UNLAWFULLY RATE THAT WE CAN ALL

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:16.933
GET THOSE BUT THE L. R. B. HAS

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.702
THAT AUTHORITY TO GO INTO WORK

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:22.906
AND GET. OUR QUICK REMEDIES IF

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:38.882
AGRICULTURAL REGIONS- THROUGHOUT

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:40.950

00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:01.170
OF WORK IN ANY GIEN CASE- AND

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:03.339

TO THE L. R. B. AND IN ADDITION

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.385
EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:16.219
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A

00:59:16.286 --> 00:59:18.688
VIOLATION OF THE LAW- THEY'RE

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:21.157

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:31.334
NOT VIOLATING THE LAW- AND NO

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.536
OTHER DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY WOULD

HAVE ANY ANY ABILITY OR

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:36.372
JURISDICTION TO DO ANYTHING

COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW THEY WERE

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:46.950

PRESUMPTIONS IN PLACE AND THE

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.810
POINT OF PRESUMPTIONS IS WILL BE

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:57.145
TO REDUCE LITIGATION. AT LEAST

01:16:57.212 --> 01:16:59.014
AROUND THE THRESHOLD ISSUE OF AN

FOR CASES TO WORK THEIR WAY

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:09.658
THROUGH OUR SYSTEM YOU KNOW THE

GOING TO ACCEPT OR DENY THE

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:19.134
CLAIM. IF IT'S ACCEPTED THERE'S

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:21.169
NO NEED FOR LITIGATION AT THAT

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.872
POINT AND WE WOULDN'T EVEN COME

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.941
INTO OUR LITIGATION SYSTEM UNTIL

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:28.710

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:44.459
BE A TRIAL PROCESS WE DON'T GET

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:45.761
THE CASE UNTIL A DECISION ISSUED

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:47.896
AND SOME PARTY IS AGGRIEVED BY

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:50.165

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:52.968
GIVEN THE TIMING AND- SOME OF

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:55.037
THE DELAYS THAT COME OF IT IS

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.104

THAT I THINK PERHAPS THAT SLOWED

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:22.297
SOME OF THOSE CASES DOWN AND

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.199

STAFFING OVER THE PAST. OF LESS

01:18:49.624 --> 01:18:51.593

THEM ON THE MERITS WILL ALSO

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:07.776
DEPEND ON THE STATE OF THE LAW

WHEN THEY GET TO US. GOOD I HAVE

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:11.113

THERE IS. CERTAINLY I'D BE

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.549

SECOND QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.288
OF THE PROCESS. AND HAVING

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:21.756
PROBABLY ON THE FIRST STEP NOT

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:23.391
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE AN AT.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.727
ISSUE I BELIEVE IF YOU GET A

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:27.596
HUGE NUMBER COMING FORWARD IF

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:29.464
THE QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINER.

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:31.032
REQUIREMENT IN THE FIRST STEP IN

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.767
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH.

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:34.436
HAVING ENOUGH OF THOSE SO. I

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:35.904
SHARE WITH ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:39.975
HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE. Q.

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:42.177
IN ME FOR A PART OF THE SYSTEM.

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:43.812
WELL THE CERTIFICATION AND

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.347
SELECTION PROCESS IS ACTUALLY

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:47.048
OVERSEEN BY THE DIVISION OF

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:49.084
WORKERS COMPENSATION WHICH IS

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:51.052
SEPARATE FROM THE W. C. A. B.

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:53.822
BUT BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE YOU

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:56.324
KNOW AS A AS AN ADVOCATE AS A

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.927
JUDGE AS SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED IN

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.762
ADMINISTRATION THERE IS

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.063
DEFINITELY A PROBLEM WITH

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.399
FINDING OUT OF QUALIFYING AND

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:07.035
RETAINING DOCTORS TO SERVE IN

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:09.538
THOSE ROLES AND I KNOW THE D. W.

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.873
C. HAS QUITE A LOT OF EFFORT

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.776
INTO EXAMINING HOW DO THAT-

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:16.545
CHANGING FEE SCHEDULES

01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:18.914
INCREASING- SOME OF THE AMOUNTS

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.682
THAT DOCTORS CAN BE PAID FOR

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.484
VARIOUS PARTS OF THEIR SERVICES.

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:24.386
I THINK I'VE ALSO DONE A GOOD

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:26.655
JOB INCREASING OUR REACH TO

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:29.591
DOCTORS TO TRY TO SOLICIT- THE

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:32.561
INTEREST IN THAT PROGRAM SO

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:34.429
HOPEFULLY THOSE EFFORTS BEAR

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:37.899
FRUIT IF NOT- YOU KNOW I THINK

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:39.067
THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:44.172
STAKEHOLDERS COMING TOGETHER AND

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.941
JUST TALKING ABOUT. ZERO TO DEAL

01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:47.609
WITH WHATEVER BOTTLENECKS AND

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:50.612
LOGJAMS RESULT FROM NOT HAVING

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:53.682
ENOUGH DOCTORS. YOU KNOW THE

01:20:53.748 --> 01:20:57.285

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:02.390
POSSIBILITY THAT THOSE WHO HAVE

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:03.825
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:06.595

THE LEGISLATURE HAS THERE BEEN.

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.439
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN M. D.

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:20.942
BY BY DEFINITION OR BY BY BY LAW

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:23.678

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:31.185
UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE GIVEN YOUR

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:33.221
EXPERIENCE AND YOUR BACKGROUND.

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:34.289
DO YOU THINK RECENT REFORM

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.024
EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE COST OF

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:37.325
HEALTH CARE BENEFITS HAVE STRUCK

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:39.193
AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.796
COST TO EMPLOYERS. AND ACCESS TO

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.298
HEALTH CARE FOR INJURED WORKERS

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:46.234
AYE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU THINK OF

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:46.935
THIS LATE AT NIGHT. ARE ALONG

01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:48.803
THE LINES OF EXCITEMENT MISS COM

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.706
BLOGGER BUT OSCAR. BUT I WOULD

01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:53.808
LOVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.276
YES YOU KNOW THAT'S THE

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:57.512
FUNDAMENTAL TENSION I THINK

01:26:57.579 --> 01:27:01.416
WITHIN THE SYSTEM THE COSTS TO-

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:03.585
CARRIERS IN TWO PLAYERS AND ALSO

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:05.620
THERE'S A COST FACTOR TO INJURED

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:08.556
WORKERS IN THE TIME TAKEN TO

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:10.792
RESOLVE DISPUTES WHILE THEY'RE

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:12.460
NOT ABLE TO WORK WHILE THEY'RE

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:14.395
MAYBE NOT GETTING TREATMENT AND

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:17.031
TO OR OF WAITING FOR SOMETHING

01:27:17.098 --> 01:27:19.634
TO BE APPROVED AND YOU KNOW

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:21.269
PEOPLE NOT SHE'S SMARTER AND

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:22.971
MUCH MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE THAN I

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:26.240
AM HAVE SPENT. YEARS PUZZLING

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:28.543
OUT THE BEST WAYS TO RESOLVE

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:31.779
THESE ISSUES I THINK- YOU KNOW

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.548
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE OUT THERE

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:35.216
THE POSSIBILITY OF BUILDING A

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:38.686
BETTER MOUSETRAP A BETTER WAY TO

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:41.255
ADDRESS THIS. I DO THINK THAT

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:43.291
ANYTHING THAT EXPEDITES THE

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:46.160
PROCESS ALSO HAS TO COME WITH IT

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:47.562
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:51.065
HEARING OF THE CONCERNS RAISED

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:53.468
ON BOTH SIDES. AND YOU KNOW I

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:54.235
UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:56.237
GOALS OF THINGS LIKE UTILIZATION

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:58.039
REVIEW AND INDEPENDENT MEDICAL

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:01.376
REVIEW. TO INJECT OBJECTIVES OF

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:03.711
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING IT INTO

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:07.048
THE SYSTEM. BUT THAT CAN'T COME

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:09.217
AT THE EXPENSE OF FULL

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:12.387
CONSIDERATION OF THE PARTICULAR

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:14.956
CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOU KNOW ANY

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:17.025
INJURED WORKER AND WHAT THEIR

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:18.893
PARTICULAR NEEDS MIGHT BE AND

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.130
THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S A HARD

01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:23.531
BALANCE TO STRIKE. WELL AGAIN I

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.366
THINK GIVEN YOUR HISTORY ON THIS

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:28.302
BOARD AS WELL AS- IT IN YOUR OWN

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:30.171
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE I. I

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:31.873
COULDN'T RESIST THE CHANCE TO

01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:33.908
ASK AND LET ME GIVE CREDIT TO

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:35.176
STAFF I THINK THAT QUESTION CAME

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:37.545
FROM SOME OF OUR INTERNAL RULES

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:38.880
STAFF I THOUGHT IT WAS AN

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:40.782
EXCELLENT- RECESSION QUESTION TO

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:42.350
GET. FROM SOMEONE OF YOUR

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:44.886
EXPERIENCE. THE LAST ONE I HAVE

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:46.387
A SORT OF ALONG THOSE LINES. IS

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:48.489
IT APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:49.223
SUGGEST CHANGES TO THE WORKERS

01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:51.125
COMPENSATION SYSTEM IF YOU FIND

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:53.227
DEFICIENCIES OF LAW AND IF SO.

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.662
HOW WOULD YOU MAKE THOSE

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:57.398
SUGGESTIONS INTO HOME. WELL AS

01:28:57.465 --> 01:28:59.167
THE COURT YOU KNOW OUR ROLE IS

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:01.002
TO TAKE THE LAWS THAT YOU THE

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:03.671
LEGISLATURE PASSED. AND APPLY

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:05.573
THEM IN INDIVIDUAL CASES AND

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.075
INTERPRET THEM TO THE BEST OF

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:11.179
OUR ABILITY. SO IT'S DIFFICULT

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:13.314
FOR US TO THEN STEP OUT OF THAT

THINK. SOMEONE WHO IS INTERESTED

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:22.323
IN IMPROVING THE SYSTEM COULD

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.492

WHERE A LIST OF THREE DOCTORS IS

01:31:50.771 --> 01:31:53.808

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:11.259
EVALUATORS- THE ARRANGEMENTS

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:12.894
HERE SHE SAID ARE TREMENDOUSLY

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.861
HELPFUL BECAUSE THE PARTIES

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.863
AGREED AT THE OUTSET THAT

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.265
THEY'RE GOING TO ABIDE BY THE

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:19.333
OPINIONS OF THIS DOCTOR. OUR

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.569
BOARD HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW

01:32:21.636 --> 01:32:24.538
MANY CASES JUST IN THE SYSTEM IN

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:27.308

DOCTOR'S OPINIONS OR MAYBE THEIR

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.986
INTERPRETATION OF THEM SO IT'S

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:41.622
NOT FOOLPROOF BUT CERTAINLY YOU

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.424

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:47.495
PARTICULAR DOCTORS OPINIONS. BUT

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:48.996
