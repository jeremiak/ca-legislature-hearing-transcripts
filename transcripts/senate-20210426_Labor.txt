I'M SUPER THE CONSULTANT LOW ASK YOU TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR CORTEZ A YEAR. SENATOR JOE BOOK HERE SENATOR DORADO. SENATOR LAYERED. SENATOR NEWMAN HERE. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM- I THINK WE WILL WAIT TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THEM A FULL COMPLEMENT HERE BEFORE WE TAKE UP THE CONSENT CALENDAR WHICH MEANS WILL MOVE TO ITEM ONE ON THE AGENDA WHICH HAPPENS TO BE SB THREE THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS MY BILL- THEREFORE I'M GOING TO IMMEDIATELY. TRANSFER THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR MEDAVOY'S SURE ALTOGETHER WON'T COME OVER TO YOU. TO COME WITH COMMITTEE RULES WHICH SAY THAT THE CHAIR- WILL NOT PRESIDE OVER THE PRESENTATION. OF HIS OR HER OWN BILL. WELCOME SENATOR CORTESE YOU MAY NOW PRESENTER BILL SB THREE THREE FIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MINIATURE. TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB THREE THIRTY FIVE OF WHICH I BELIEVE IS COMMONSENSE MEASURE THAT WOULD SEEK TO REDUCE UNREASONABLE DELAYS ON WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS UNDER EXISTING LAW TIMELINES. MANY EMPLOYERS WAIT UNTIL THE TAIL END OF THE NIGHT IS CURRENTLY ALLOWED THEM TO DENY WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS CAUSING SERIOUS IMPACTS TO EMPLOYEES PHYSICAL MENTAL WELL BEING AND DOING THEM EVEN FURTHER FROM COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT AND EVENTUAL RETURN TO WORK. SB THREE THIRTY FIVE WOULD REDUE THE TIME THAT AN EMPLOYER HAS TO DENY OR ACCEPT LIABILITY FOR A WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIM FROM NINETY DAYS TO FORTY FIVE DAYS. FOR PUBLIC SAFETY OF VOICES WOULD BE REDUCED EVEN FURTHER TO THIRTY DAYS. WELL THERE'S A BACK INJURY CAUSING SEVERE PAIN OR CANCER THAT NEEDS URGENT TREATMENT BEFORE CAN SPREAD QUICKLY TO THE CATION OF AN INJURY CLAIM SHOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEE WHO'S BEEN INJURED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. ADDITIONALLY SB THREE THIRTY FIVE WOULD IMPOSE A 10% INCREASE ON THE AMOUNT DUE FOR ANY PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION IS FOUND TO BE UNREASONABLY DELAYED OR REFUSED. OPPONENTS OF THIS LEGISLATION WILL SAY THAT IT'S AN UNDULY HARSH PUNISHMENT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS PROVISION IS TARGETED TOWARDS. UNREASONABLE DELAYS AND REFUSALS WHICH ARE TOOLS OF BAD ACTOR IMPORTERS. FINALLY SB THREE THIRTY FIVE WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL TREATMENT AN EMPLOYER MUST IMMEDIATELY COVER. FROM A REASONABLE INCREASE THAT INTENDS TO PRESERVE THE VALUE OF THESE BENEFITS BY KNOWLEDGE IN THE INCREASES IN THE COST OF LIVING. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE ORIGINAL DOLLAR AMOUNT. HERE WITH US TO TESTIFY OVER THE PHONE HIS CHRISTY PALMER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THANK YOU MENTION. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE THREE FIVE- AND WE DO HAVE LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS CHRISTY BALMA SHE ON THE LINE. BOTH IN PERSON SORRY. PLEASE PROCEED WILL MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CHRISTY VALVE. MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS AND EMS PERSONNEL IN CALIFORNIA I'M PROUD SPONSORS OF SB THREE THIRTY FIVE LITTLE HARD TO HEAR GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHORED CHAIRMAN A LITTLE HARD TO HEAR I'M SORRY. IT'S PROBABLY NOT HER FAULT INNOVATIVE YOU BE DONE- AT SCHOOL. IS IT ON THIS IS A BETTER IS BETTER. ANYWAY WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOU INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE TO TACKLE UNREASONABLE DENIALS AND DELAYS IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IT IS NOT SPECULATIVE TO SUGGEST THE DELAYS INCREASED COSTS FOR ALL PARTIES IN THE SYSTEM. AND YET OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED WITH THESE DELAYS. IN EVERY ANALYSIS PUT OUT BY THIS COMMITTEE WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS ARE PROBABLY JUST APPROPRIATELY DESCRIBED AS A LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR PUTTING THEIR THUMB ON THE SCALE. TO TIP TIP THE BURDEN OF PROOF TOWARDS THE INJURED WORKER. SUCH INTERVENTIONS ARE FOR GOOD REASON FLICKR'S COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS ARE INVALUABLE PROTECTION. TO THE KNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE THE PERSONAL RISK FACED ON THE JOB BY FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER WORKERS COVERED BY THESE PRESUMPTIONS AND IMPORTANTLY THE ADVANCE THE GOAL THAT WE ALL SHARE OF GIVING FIREFIGHTERS ANOTHER INJURED WORKERS EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO THE JOB THEY LOVE. REMARKABLY FIREFIGHTERS DON'T EXPERIENCES DIFFERENCE WHEN DEALING WITH A PRESUMPTIVE INJURY OR ILLNESS. IT'S MORE COMMONPLACE NOW FOR THE EMPLOYER INSURER OR THIRD ARTY ADMINISTRATOR. TO INITIALLY DESIGNED TO DENY A PRESUMPTIVE CLAIMS. FACING NO MATERIAL RISK OF INCURRING PENALTIES OF THAT CLAIM IS ALTERNATELY ACCEPTED. NOT ONLY IS THE INJURY CLAIM DENIED. BUT ALSO OT OFF UNTIL THE NINETIETH DAY WITH LITTLE TO NO INVESTIGATION REQUESTS FOR MEDICAL RECORDS OR ANY OTHER ANALYSIS DONE BY THE EMPLOYER IN FACT. MANY OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS REGULARLY TO SEE RECEIVED A CONDITIONAL THE NILE. PENDING THE OUTCOME OF A QUEUE OF ME. THIS IS THE VERY PRACTICE OF THE OPPOSITION SUGGEST WOULD OCCUR IF THIS BILL PRESS PASSES. IT'S HPPENING NOW BECAUSE THE STATUS QUO. INJURED FIREFIGHTERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE CARRYING THE PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL BECAUSE OF AND REASONABLE TO AND DENIALS THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO SPEND THEIR TIME. FIGHTING THEIR INSTILL THIS DAN FIGHTING THE SYSTEM. TO WHAT END. EVERY DELAY HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR INJURED WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS MEASURE ACCURATELY ALIGNED BY THE GERMAN ALIGNS THE INCENTIVES TO ENSURE THE SPECIAL NATURE OF THESE INJURIES OR ILLNESSES ILLNESSES IS PRESERVED. AND CONDITIONAL DENIALS ONLY RESULT. WHEN THE EMPLOYERS MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO INVESTIGATE THE NATURE OF THE ENERGY INJURY. SORRY IT'S HARD TO SPEAK IN A MASK DON'T GET ME WRONG. THE ADVERSARIAL PART OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION EXISTS. TO BE EMPLOYED AND TO SCRUTINIZE THOSE CLAIMS THAT HAVE A CLEAR CONNECTION BEYOND WORK. IN A PRESENT OR PRESENT A COMPLEXITY THAT MUST BE EXAMINED BUT IN PRACTICE THAT ADVERSARIAL PROCESS. IS APPLIED ALL TOO OFTEN IN EVERY SINGLE CASE AND FIREFIGHTERS ARE FORCED TO WAIT AND TO FIGHT. MANY TIMES. SB THREE THIRTY FIVE IS CLEAR AND SIMPLE MEASURE RESPECTS THE VALUE OF A WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTION. REALIZE THE TIME LINES TO MOVE AN INJURED WORKER CLOSER TOWARDS RESOLUTION. OF THEIR INJURY CLAIMS. MANAGERS PROTECTION FOR THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING MEDICAL TREATMENT. WHILE THE CLAIM IS BEING REVIEWED FOR THESE REASONS. WE HEARD YOUR SUPPORT OF SB THREE THIRTY FIVE TODAY THANK. THANK YOU MS BOWMAN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS AFTERNOON.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE CHECK THE LINES ONE MORE TIME JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL OVER SUPPORT WITNESSES.

THANK YOU MADAM OUR MODERATOR HAVING HEARD FROM ALL OUR SUPPORTERS WILL NOT FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION. AND WE DO HAVE. TO LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESSES MR JASON SCHMIDT SMELTS SCHMELTER ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I JUST DON'T CARE THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED- THANK YOU- DECENT SHELTER HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE THIRTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND PRISON PUBLIC RISK INNOVATION SOLUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT. UNDER WORKERS COMPENSATION LAW EMPLOYERS ARE GIVEN NINETY DAYS TO DETERMINE LIABILITY FOR WORKPLACE INJURIES IF EMPLOYERS DO NOT IMMEDIATELY ACCEPT LIABILITY AND INSTEAD EXERCISED THE RIGHT TO INVESTIGATE A CLAIM THEN THEY MUST PROVIDE UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF MEDICAL TREATMENT TO THE INJURED WORKER. DURING THE PERIOD OF THAT INVESTIGATION SB THREE THIRTY FIVE CUTS THAT INVESTIGATION INTO FORTY FIVE DAYS FOR MOST CLAIMS AND THIRTY DAYS FOR CLAIMS THAT ARE COVERED BY A PRESUMPTION FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW FREQUENTLY EMPLOYERS UTILIZE THE INVESTIGATION PERIOD OUR CLIENT PRISM EVALUATED. THEIR LAST FIVE YEARS OF CLAIMS DATA THREE THREE THOUSAND CLAIMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE OU WITH THE NUMBERS THAT THE SPONSOR DID NOT 86% OF CLAIMS ARE ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY 13% OF CLAIMS WERE DELAYED TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. 10% OF THE CLAIMS OR ALTERNATELY DENIED AFTER INVESTIGATION 3% OF THE CLAIMS ARE ULTIMATELY ACCEPTED AND 1% WERE ALTERNATELY DENIED AND THEN ACCEPTED 1% SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IT MEANS THAT EMPLOYERS IMMEDIATELY ACCEPT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMS AVOID UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND ONLY A TINY PERCENTAGE OF OUR DECISIONS END UP BEING INCORRECT. SB THREE THIRTY FIVE HAS THE EFFECT OF DEPRIVING EMPLOYERS WITH ENOUGH TIME TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A SIMPLE AFFAIR WE'VE GOT A INTERVIEW THE INJURED WORKER EMPLOYERS DOCTORS AND WITNESSES WE'VE GOT TO OBTAIN RELEVANT MEDICAL INSURANCE RECORDS WE HAVE TO SCHEDULE MEDICAL LEGAL EVALUATION WE HAVE TO COMPLETE THE EVALUATION AND RECEIVED THE REPORT AND OCCASIONALLY WE NEED TO DEPOSE THE INJURED WORKER. SB THREE THIRTY FIVE WOULD DRASTICALLY CUT THE INVESTIGATION CARRIED TIME FOR EMPLOYERS BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY CHANGE OTHER PROVISIONS IN A LAW THAT WOULD CONFLICT WITH THIS NEW LAW. LET'S TOUCH ON THOSE VERY BRIEFLY. PLAYER COACH FORTY SIX TWO POINT ONE AND TWO TEN. FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE A PANEL CUMAE ONCE PANEL'S BEEN REQUESTED THE PARTIES ARE THEN GIVEN TEN DAYS TO STRIKE A DOCTOR FROM THE LAST. SECURE ME THEN HAS SIXTY DAYS TO SET AN APPOINTMENT AND ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS TO FINISH THE EVALUATION. WE STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW EMPLOYERS WOULD YOU EVER. GENERATION INVESTIGATION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SB THIRTY THREE THIRTY FIVE. IT'S POORLY CRAFTED AND WOULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION TO CALIFORNIA'S INJURED WORKERS EMPLOYERS AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR NOTEBOOK.

YET WE ARE ALSO ENCUMBERED BY FINANCIAL REALITIES THAT REQUIRE CAREFUL ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT WE WELCOME FURTHER CONVERSATION FUNDS AT JANICE AGENCY THAT SYSTEM DOES WORK TO ENSURE THAT ANY WORKER WITH AN INDUSTRIAL INJURY RECEIVED MEDICAL TREATMENT AT NO COST TO THE WORKER ALL INJURED WORKERS ARE ENTITLED TO IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE AT THEIR EMPLOYER'S EXPENSE AND WHILE THAT CARRIED BEING PROVIDED ADMINISTRATORS ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THAT ONE BE HONEST THIRTY THREE DESIGNATE AND Q. THAT IT WORK RELATED. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AN EMPLOYER FUNDED TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE UNTIL THE CLAIM IS ACCEPTED OR DENIED TO SHORTEN INVESTIGATION PERIOD AND THIS BILL MAY FORCE I COMPATIBILITY DECISIONS PRIOR TO RECEIVING MEDICAL RECORDS OR EVALUATING POSITION REPORTS WITHOUT WHICH A CLAIM CANNOT CONCEIVABLY BE APPROVED AS YOU HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER THAT JUSTIN IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE TIME FRAMES PROPOSED BY THE BILL NOR IS THERE SUFFICIENT DATA THAT IT'S NECESSARY. ULTIMATELY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE ABBREVIATED TIME FRAME WILL INCREASE CLAIM DENIALS FOSTER INCREASED AND UNNECESSARY LITIGATION TRY THAT CLAIM COSTS AND ULTIMATELY. NEGATIVELY IMPACT INJURED WORKERS- THIS BILL IF MORTGAGE THAN OFFICE. THE PROPOSAL. A LOT ANY OVER FOR AFTER BENNETT. THAT INCLUDE RECEIVING THEIR FULL SALARY TAX. AND RETIRED.

YOU ARE WELCOME TO PRESENT THE TIME THANK YOU MAY CHAIR- A MISTER CHAIR MADAM VICE AND AS THIRTY NINE MOST THE PER. AGAINST CLAIMS FILED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT FOR AND BENEFITS TO PREVENT THESE BENEFITS FROM GOING IN L. RE. THE CURRENT IN CURSEIN. FOLLOWING THE FED GOVERNMENT THREE TO COPE WITH IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY CALIBER TASK THE EDT WITH DISTURBING THE CARES ACT FRIENDS. THROUGH A NEWLY CREATED PANDEMIC AND ASSISTANCE AND EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM HOWEVER DESPITE HAVING BEEN WARNED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ABOUT THE POTENTIAL RISK OF FRAUD DDT WAS NOT PREPARED TO PREVENT OR ADDRESS FRAUDULENT CLAIMS WITH THE DEPARTMENT. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE STATE AUDIT REVEALED THAT THE E. D. D. M. THAT THE EDT WAS TOLD ABOUT THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM IN THE RISK FACTORS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND THEY DID NOTHING TO PREVENT THIS FRAUD. MANY OF THESE CLAIMS WERE FILED IN INMATES- FILED BY INMATES OR THEIR ACCOMPLICES SOME WERE FILED USING THE IDENTITIES OF WELL KNOWN CONVICTED MURDERERS LIKE SCOTT PETERSON OTHER EXAMPLES OF CONVICTED KILLERS- THAT HAD CLAIMS FILED UNDER THEIR NAMES INCLUDE ROYAL CLARK WHO WAS CONVICTED OF KILLING TWO YOUNG GIRLS IN ASSAULTING ANOTHER. IN SUSAN EUBANKS WHO SHOT HER FOUR SONS AGES. FOUR THREE FOURTEEN. ALL THE WHILE BEEN. WE'RE DELAY BY THE E. D. D. TO OUR SINK MOMS FATHER. AND WERE FORCED TO DRAW THEIR SAY ACCOUNTS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. FRAUDULENT CLAIMS THAT WERE NOT WARRANTED TO BE PAID SHOULD NOT BE AWARDED TO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT DESERVE THEM. AT THE TIME THE FRAUD WAS DISCOVERED IN CALIFORNIA THIRTY FIVE OTHER STATES HAD ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SOME SORT OF FRAUD PROTECTION. TO ADDRESS THESE INMATES SCAMS CALIFORNIA DID NOT AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER IN OUR STATE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WERE LEFT HIGH AND DRY. AS THE EDG FAILED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SERVICE AND WE ALL HEARD ABOUT IT FROM OUR DISTRICT OFFICES. AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THIS SORT OF FRAUD DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS JUST LOST THEIR JOB AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE OF THE CODE RESPONSE. CALIFORNIA MUST DO BETTER AND THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ANYTHING ELSE SB THIRTY NINE WILL PROTECT TAXPAYER FUNDS WHILE HELPING TO ENSURE THAT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS GO. TO ELIGIBLE UNEMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS BY MAINTAINING THAT THE EDG CONDUCT REGULAR CROSS MATCHING. OF THEIR RECORDS WITH DATA PROVIDED BY THE CDC ARE AT LEAST EVERY NINETY DAYS. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE DATA TO ONLY INCLUDE INFORMATION OF CURRENT INMATES. IT ALSO REQUIRES EDIE NOTIFY THE DOJ AND CDC ARE IF THEY DISCOVER EVIDENCE OF FRAUD IN THEIR CROSS MATCHING. PRIOR TO TODAY'S HEARING I WORKED WITH SENATOR SKINNER AND WIENER TO NARROW THE BILL TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RELATED TO THE SENSITIVE NATURE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION. THAT WOULD BE SHARED BETWEEN CDC R. N. E. D. D. THE APRIL FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS WERE RESULTED THIS THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I BELIEVE THEY SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS. THEIR CONCERNS AND FURTHER ANY AND FURTHER MY EFFORTS TO REBUILD THE TRUST AND- EXPECTATIONS THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE IN THEIR STAY A GOVERNMENT S. B. TH NINE. BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND WAS VOTED OUT OF PUBLIC SAFETY ON A FOUR ZERO VOTE FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE RESPECTFULLY.

THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD EIGHT ZERO NAY. ASSET ON PUBLIC SHE HELLO. IN TOWN WHERE WE HAVE HAD UNFORTUNATELY THE HIGHEST HOMICIDE RATE PER CAPITA IN CALIFORNIA FOR SEVERAL YEARS RUNNING. HUIZAR DEADLIEST YEAR ON RECORD IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX HOMICIDES TWENTY TWENTY ALSO BROUGHT US THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FRAUD ON TAXPAYER FUNDS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY WITH WIDESPREAD ET FRAUD WE SAW THIS FRAUD NOT ONLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITHIN OUR COUNTY JAIL AND IN STATE PRISONS. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOCAL AND STATE INMATES ARE INVOLVED. ORANGE COUNTY HAS BEEN PRETTY IMPACTED BY EDT FRAUD BECAUSE OUR COUNTY HAS FIVE STATE PRISONS. MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. AND MANY PROSECUTORS INVESTIGATORS IN MY OFFICE DESPITE IS HAVING SUCH A HIGH HOMICIDE RATE THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED FROM OTHER UNITS WITHIN THE OFFICE TO WORK EXCLUSIVELY ON EDT FRAUD. AT A LOSS TO TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATED WITH EDT FRAUD CONTINUES TO INCREASE AS WE LEARN ABOUT THE MASSIVE SCALE OF THIS ABUSE CURRENT ESTIMATES PLACE THE AMOUNT OF LOSS TO CALIFORNIA. AT THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS MANY OF CALIFORNIANS MOST VIOLENT INMATES TO SENATOR GIRLS THAT STATED HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE FRAUD IN IT AND IT CERTAINLY MAKES IT HARDER FOR US TO ASSERT THAT CRIME DOES NOT PAY. ANALYSTS CROSS MATCHING REQUIREMENTS LIKE THOSE PROPOSED HERE ARE IMPLEMENTED CALIFORNIA RISKS MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES THAT LEFT IT OPEN TO BE PICK POCKETED BY CRIMINALS ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. S. TO DO SERIES OF PUBLIC FUNDS WE ALL OWE A DUTY TO ENSURE THAT TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE PROTECTED FROM ABUSE AND FRAUD THEREFORE I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB. THIRTY NINE THANK YOU SO MUCH.

TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM THE CENTER DRAWS A- THANK YOU FOR. FIVE OBVIOUSLY AS THE AUTHOR NO THE WAS A IN ORDER RECEIVED MANY OF THE URGENCY OF GETTING THE AND FOUGHT THAT IMPACT EVERYBODY- HOWEVER I HAVE A SEVERAL CONCERN. OF PRIME AROUND OF THE DUKE. OF THESE AND WHO COULD BE DENIED. WITHOUT BOMB HAVING SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT THEY'LL JUST GET CAUGHT UP IN THE- IN THE WHIRLWIND OF IT ALL- AT THE E. D. D. HEARING THAT WE HAD A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. MONTHS AGO I THINK IT. IT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THE FRAUD CASES I KNOW IN THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THAT- EDT PAID BILLIONS THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FRAUDULENT KAMES AT CLAIMS. THAT MONEY WENT TO INMATES WHO ARE INELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THESE BENEFITS WHAT WAS VERY CLEAR FROM THE HEARING IS THAT 9295% OF THE FRAUD CASES WERE NOT ATTRIBUTED TO. ANYONE WHO HAD BEEN INCARCERATED DURING THAT TIME SO OVER TRUE BEAUTY IN THE PERCENTAGE OF FRAUD CASES. ARE SO DRAMATICALLY I THINK IS AN INCORRECT THING TO PUT FORWARD CONSIDERING THAT WHAT WE REALLY WANT IS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF ANYONE WHO BROKE THE LAW ANYBODY WHO FILED A FRAUDULENT CAME ON A CLAIM. SO I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT BECOMES THE DRIVING FORCE HERE THAT- YOU KNOW WOULD LEAD US TO DENY LEGITIMATE BY ANYONE WHO WAS EITHER INCARCERATED- AT THE TOP- AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST A RELEASE FROM CARS SERRATION OR MAYBE NOT EVEN EVER HAVING BEEN INCARCERATED- I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CORRECT APPROACH TO TAKE ON THIS. SO I- I WOULD- I THINK THAT THERE'S TO BE DONE FOR TWO THE DUE PROCESS OF A CLAIM IN REGARD OF WHO CLAIM IS- THAT. WE MAKE. THAT WE'RE NOT THE NINE THAT WHEN I TURN AROUND AND DO YOU NINE- PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LEGITIMATE CLAIMS SO I- I WOULD- VERY NARROW SOME. ON THE BILL IF- IF THERE WERE IS ASSURANCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADD DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS- SO THAT- EVERYONE HAS THE SAME RIGHT. TO COLLECT THE BENEFITS AND WITHOUT SORT OF BEING THROWN INTO. INTO. THE BATCH OF OTHER PEOPLE. THANK YOU AND MISTER OUR MAIN SPAHN JERRY FOR RESERVE YOUR COM AND YOUR- I'M SORRY IF I MISSED HER. THE THAT WAS MY AND- MIND AT SHOULD READ THAT THERE'S THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS OF ESTIMATED TOTAL FRAUD OUT THERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH WITH UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITFRAUD THERE'S AN ESTIMATE OF ALMOST TWO BILLION. I'M OF INMATE FRAUD A PERFECT EXAMPLE- IT IS JUST RECENTLY THERE WAS A AN INDIVIDUAL IN FRESNO WITH IT- JASON VERTS AND IT IS A FRESNO FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD ANNA POWERS. IS AN INMATE AT A CENTRAL FACILITY IN THE WOMEN'S FACILITY IN CHOWCHILLA SHE SUBMITTED FRAUDULENT CLAIMS AND ON THE INITIAL EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE BENEFIT PROGRAM AND IT DID SHOW THAT- A HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS PAID TO THOSE BENEFITS NOW THAT'S A SMALL PORTION. OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF ESTIMATED FRIED- THAT'S IN THE PRISON SYSTEM- BUT THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN PROVEN SO FAR. AND BUT THAT HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS NO MATTER HOW SMALL IT IS COMPARED TO THE TOTAL NUMBER IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR MY CONSTITUENTS FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WERE DELAYED BENEFITS- THE OTHER THING IS THAT. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN THAT SENATOR SKINNER SAYS SKINNER AND SENATOR WIENER AND I WORKED ON. IT NARROWED IT SO IT WASN'T A BLANKET JUST REPORT ONE TIME CDC ARE- REPORTS THOSE TWO EDT- EVERY NINETY DAYS SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE GET OUT- IF THERE'S ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS- ONCE THEY GET EMPLOYED OR THEY CAN GO BACK ON AN EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. PRIOR TO BEING INCARCERATED WITH THE DOLLARS THAT THEY ORANGE PRIOR TO BE INCARCERATED THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND WOULD BE VALIDATED FOR JUST THAT NINETY DAYS. AS FAR AS THE COMMENT THAT YOU MADE ABOUT- OTHER THAN INDIVIDUALS A INCARCERATED IN CDCR DURING THAT NINETY DAY PERIOD. I DON'T SEE HOW ANY OTHER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS TO BE PROVIDED TO THE EDT OFFICE BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING THEM DIRECTLY FROM CDC. ARE SO IF AND I YES YOU KNOW THERE COULD BE AN INVERSE NUMBER. AND THE MEASURE-OF THIS SECURE NUMBERS OR I WOULD SAY HI. HI READERS IS KARENA WOULD BE THOSE OF THE IN CARS. AND THEY WOULD BE ON. NINETY DAY PERIOD- PRIOR TO THE REPORT REQUEST. SYNDROMES OF ANYTHING ELSE ON. AND I JUST I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE OTHER ALL AMENDMENTS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO FURTHER PROTECT THE DUE PROCESS SO BOB BE SUBMITTING TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND MY MAN MY INTENTION IS NOT TO DENY ANYONE WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS TO HAVE BENEFITS IT'S A 1100% EMPLOYER FUNDED PROGRAM THE CARES ACT CAME FROM TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND IT'S JUST I FEEL AS LEGISLATORS WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AND HAVING THE HIGHEST- PRISON POPULATION IN MY DISTRICT WITH- SEVERAL PRISONS IT'S BECOMING EVIDENT THAT MORE AND MORE FRAUD IS BEING COMMITTED AND PERPETRATED AGAINST OUR OUR TAX PAYING CITIZENS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE BENEFITS THAT ARE NOT GETTING THESE BENEFITS AND- AS A LARGE NUMBER OF DOLLARS AND I REALIZE THAT TWO BILLION IS A FAR CRY FROM THIRTY BILLION BUT STILL TWO BILLION DOLLARS WOULD MAKE SURE THAT A LOT OF OUR INDIVIDUAL. CONSTITUENTS IN OUR DISTRICTS THAT ARE ENTITLED TO BENEFITS WOULD RECEIVE THOSE BENEFITS IF THEY WEREN'T BEING ILLEGALLY GIVEN TO AND INMATE CENTER CARS RATED THAT HAVE FILED FRAUDULENT CLAIMS.

IN CONSULTATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO FOR A BORDER RELATIONS COUNCIL TO JOINTLY FORM A STUDY GROUP OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO ANALYZE UNIQUE CHALLENGES. AND OPPORTUNITIES ARISING FROM THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE BI NATIONAL STUDENT POPULATION AND WORKFORCE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO BORDER. CALIFORNIA'S MANY OF US IN OUR IS PART OF THE WORLD'S MOST. IMPACTFUL WORLD ECONOMIES AND WE HAVE A REGION WITH IN CALIFORNIA COMBINED WITH MEXICO- OF WHICH OF. YOU KNOW IF YOU ADDED UP ALL THE BORDER STATES ALONG THE US MEXICO BORDER. THE BORDER STATES BEING OF THE STATE'S OF MEXICO AND- UNITED STATES THAT ARE- JOIN EACH OTHER TO BORDER. THE STATE'S JOINTLY WOULD CON THE THIRD LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. HEARING CALIFORNIA WHAT WE CALL THE LESS SANTEE CORRIDOR WHICH IS FROM LOS ANGELES TO THE QUANTUM. THIS CALL REGION WOULD HAVE THE LAW ELEVENTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THE PASSAGE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT LED TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE US AND MET MEXICAN ECONOMIES THROUGH INCREASED BORDER MANUFACTURING AND TRADE. OVER FIVE MILLION US JOBS ARE SUPPORTED BY TRADE WITH MEXICO FORMING PART OF A COMPLEX NETWORK OF CROSS BORDER SUPPLY CHAINS IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS TO WAIT TRADING GOODS BETWEEN MEXICO IN THE UNITED STATES INCREASED DRAMATICALLY FROM. EIGHTY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE. TO FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT. I'M BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY IN TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA EXPORTS TO MEXICO AMOUNTED TO TWENTY FOUR OVER TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA IMPORTED. OVER FORTY SEVEN BILLION IN GOODS FROM MEXICO. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN GROUND ZERO FOR ADVANCED CROSS BORDER MANUFACTURING AND TRADE WE HAVE NOT TAKEN THE APPROPRIATE STEPS NEEDED TO PREPARE THE WORKFORCE NEEDED TO SUSTAIN OUR BY NATIONAL ECONOMY RESEARCH SHOWS A CALIFORNIA COULD STAND TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM PREPARING OUR WORKFORCE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH THE SIGNING OF THE U. S. MCA. FOR THE US BORDER STATES THE INCREASE OF EMPLOYMENT AND GDP COULD RANGE FROM SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND TO ONE POINT FOUR MILLION JOBS CONFERENCE NINE DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED I'M I MEAN I'M SORRY FROM SIXTY NINE TWO HUNDRED FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDED TO GDP. WHAT THE LARGEST IMPACT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THESE BENEFITS CANNOT BE REALIZED IF WE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE MILLIONS OF KIDS AND YOUNG ADULTS. THAT ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEX HISTORY BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO TODAY THERE ARE NONE S. BEST ESTIMATED HALF A MILLION MINERS IN MEXICO WITH TIES TO THE UNITED STATES THAT'S WHAT SOME WHAT SOME FORMER OTHER THESE ARE U. S. CITIZENS LIVING IN MEXICO. AND MILLIONS OF STUDENTS FROM MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS HOUSEHOLDS ENROLLED IN SCHOOLS BETWEEN MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES THE STUDENTS COMPRISE A SEGMENT OF A GROWING BI NATIONAL STUDENT POPULATION INCLUDES STUDENTS ACROSS THE BORDER EVERY DAY TO ATTEND SCHOOL. STUDENTS OF MEXICAN DESCENT AND COLLEGE STUDENTS TAKEN BY NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES AMONG OTHERS APTLY CALLED THE STUDENTS WE SHARE. THIS IS A POPULATION OF STUDENTS SORT OF EXPERIENCE FUNCTIONING IN A MORE GLOBAL SOCIETY AND YET THEY REPORT LOWER EDUCATIONAL ASPIRATIONS AND THEIR PEERS BY BRINGING AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS A BI NATIONAL EDUCATION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

I REALLY THINK THIS IS A- GREAT IDEA OF- OF USING THE RESOURCES FROM EACH SIDE THE TALENT THE COMMITMENT THAT WE ALL HAVE. AND THAT'S NOT USUALLY. THE PICTURE THAT WE PAINT OUR FROM THE BORDER. YOU KNOW IT'S USUALLY ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE COMING OVER HERE TO THE SIDE AND- THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO OFFER THEIR RUNNING.

PLEASE COME ON UP I THINK WE HAVE A SANITIZED AREA FOR YOU THERE AND YOU MAY PERCENT WHENEVER YOU'RE COMFORTABLE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIR. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OVER THE COURSE OF THIS LAST YEAR LONGER THAN THAT NOW. I RATHER DOUBT IT EVER OFFICES HAVE RECEIVED MORE CALLS. COMPLAINTS AND FRANTIC ENTREATIES FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS THEN THE SITUATION AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. HAVING DEALT WITH THIS DEPARTMENT FOR MANY MANY YEARS I WOULD NOTE THAT IT IS A TROUBLED DEPARTMENT AND LONG HAS BEEN. I WOULD FURTHER NOTE THAT THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD LOYAL HARD WORKING PEOPLE WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT. SHOULD SHARE THEIR JOBS AND DOING THE BEST THEY CAN. BUT I WILL HAVE TO SAY THAT OF LATE. WE WITH THE PANDEMIC. THEY'VE BEEN A MISERABLE AND GRIEVOUS FATAL FAILURE. THE CALLS THE HELP COMMAND BESIEGE OUR OFFICERS SHOULD. WITH INSTRUCTIVE IN GETTING REPORTS FROM MY OWN TEAM MYSELF. PEOPLE WOULD CALL IN. AND HAVE A HUMAN VOICE ANSWERED THE PHONE AND BEGIN WEEPING. LEAPING BECAUSE THEY REACHED THE HUMAN VOICE. INSTEAD OF NOT HAVING ANY ACCESS BY MANY MEANS THAT OTHERS HAVE TRIED. IT DIDN'T WORK. MANY WERE IN JEOPARDY OF. LOSING THEIR APARTMENTS. NOT HAVING ANY FOOD. THIS IS UTTERLY AND ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE. IN THE STATE. IRONICALLY EVEN WELL INTO THIS DISASTER. THE DEPARTMNT. EXPERIENCE TO. TECHNOLOGY FAILURES. CRASHED THERE SYSTEMS CRASH. FURTHER COMPLICATING THEIR INABILITY. TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE THERE'S NO MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE BEFORE US TODAY MAYBE THAN OTHER THAN CORONAVIRUS. IN THIS ONE TO DEAL WITH ON BEHALF OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. THE AUDITOR'S DEPARTMENT DID A VERY THOROUGH REVIEW AND INVESTIGATION. OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ENTER PROFFERED REPORTS TO THIS HONORABLE BODY- WHICH I HAVE HERE. THERE WAS A WRITTEN REPORT AS WELL. IN A NOTE RELATED TO THESE. PORCH BUT THE STATE AUDITOR AND OR- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. VERY OFTEN WE MEMBERS IN OUR BUSINESS DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THESE REPORTS. I SUBMIT THAT WE CERTAINLY OUGHT TO. I TRY TO DISCIPLINE MYSELF AND NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M VERY GOOD AT IT EITHER. THEY DO STACK UP BUT THIS ONE. CANNOT BE IGNORED. THEY HAVE DEFINED WHAT THEY HAVE DEVELOPED DEPARTMENT TO BEAT THE GREAT SUPPOSED TO GREGIS UNNECESSARY PROBLEMS TO ADDRESS FOURTH WITH. WITHIN THIS DEPARTMENT. AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S INCUMBENT SINCE WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY EFFORTS MUCH PUT FORTH BY ATV. RIGHT NOW IT'S OUR JOB. THE LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND WITH THE MANAGERS LONG TERM SYSTEMIC DANCERS IN CHANGING HOW THE WHOLE OPERATION CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS. THE ORDER DID LOOK AT THE PLEASURE OF ITEMS WITHIN THEIR- PURVIEW AND HOW THEY DID THEIR JOBS. AND THEY HIGHLIGHTED A NUMBER OF. THIS BILL EXPRESSLY RECITES. MAJOR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR. PLEASE DIDN'T COME FROM A FAR I DIDN'T THINK THESE UP MYSELF. I'VE BEEN AWARE OF THEM FOR A VERY LONG TIME. BUT IN FORMULATING AND PRESENTING THE BILL TO YOU. THESE ARE FROM THE ORDER. AND ONE OF OUR COMMENTATORS AND I'M CALLING HIM A COMMENTATOR MISTER BOB HARRIS TODAY WILL BE ON THE LINE. THE AUDITOR DOES NOT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL NOT BE BEFORE OR OPPOSED TO. BUT WILL OFFER REASONS RATIONALE FOR THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. I SUFFICE TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THEY ARE CERTAINLY. UNBIASED BODY AND I'VE ENJOYED WORKING WITH THEM AND FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND MANY MANY ISSUES. QUICKLY TO ROLL OVER THIS I DON'T KNOW. A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF THE I. T. SYSTEM IS VITAL. THE NURSES ONE FOLKS WE HAVE GOT TO GET RIGHT OVER DECADES THIS STATE THE HIGH TECH CAPITAL OF THE WORLD HAS SELDOM IF EVER. GOTTEN ANY MAJOR BILLION DOLLAR HIGH TECH PROJECTS RIGHT. THE BILL OVER BUDGET NOT ON TIME. WE CANNOT DO THAT HERE. THE CALL CENTER OPERATIONS ALSO BEEN A MISERABLE FAILURE. AND THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED THERE. TO AND THEN INSISTING THEY HAVE TRAINED STAFF AVAILABLE TO MANAGE CALL STATIONS ONE OF THE IRONIES I GUESS I SHOULD MISSTATED THE DIDN'T PROPOSE ANYTHING WELL YEAH. HE DID THEY TOOK PEOPLE FROM OTHER AGENCIES HAVE ASSIGNED THEM THE EIGHTY D. AND THAT TOOK THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING THESE PROBLEM SOLVING JOBS HELPING OUR CONSTITUENTS AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS. THAT IS SIGNED INTO THE TRAINERS. THAT DEFIES LOGIC HOW THAT MAKES ANY SENSE OR HOW THAT HELPS. PEOPLE SO TRAINED STAFF WILL BE VITAL. THERE WILL ALSO NEED TO BE A WHOLE OVERHAUL OF HOW THIS AGENCY. DEALS WITH OR RATHER DOES NOT DEAL WITH FRAUD. I NOTED THERE EIGHT DIFFERENT LITTLE DIVISIONS OR DEPARTMENTS. WITHIN EIGHTY NOW THAT HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR FRAUD. WELL IT SEEMS LIKE NOBODY HAS BEEN ON DUTY. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A HUGE BILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM WITH FRAUD COULD CONTEND WITH. SEOUL TIME ADVOCATING A SINGLE UNIT THERE IN. IN CHARGE OF RESPONSIBLE FOR AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE. UNDER THE GOVERNOR ENTER THE LEGISLATURE FOR ENSURING THOSE FRAUD NUMBERS REMAIN. NOT REMAIN BELOW ARE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT DARE HOPE THAT WOULD BE THE CASE. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER AND CONSOLIDATION AND ONE UNIT FOCUSED ON AN ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIBLE I THINK WILL HELP. FURTHER THIS IS NOT BEYOND THE CAPABILITY. SHUTTING FOR CONTINGENCIES FOR SUCH EVENTUALITIES RECESSIONS. THEY DO HAPPEN. WE HAVE THE WORLD'S OF ECONOMIST. THOUSANDS OF HISTORY BOOKS WHICH WE CAN REVIEW OF THE PREDICTABILITY OF RECESSIONS. AND EVEN DEPRESSION. THEY WILL HAPPEN AND WE ARE SAYING NOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THIS AGENCY HAS. GATHER INFORMATION FROM THOSE KNOWING ENTITIES. THE PROJECT AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY OR EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY TO PREPARE FOR THOSE EVENTUALITIES IN THIS CASE NOTHING. NO PREPARATION FOR ANY EMERGENCY SITUATION AND- THEN THAT WE WOULD REQUIRE THEM. AND THIS IS ONE OF MY LEAST. IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. NOW WHY WOULD I SAY THAT'S MY LEAST. BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVER TAKE THOSE REPORTS SERIOUSLY. AND TO SELL THEM AS I SAID ON THE BEGAN THIS DISCUSSION NEWLY. A REPORT. IS WONDERFUL IF IT'S USED BUT MOST ARE NOT. THE CLOSING I WOULD SUBMIT. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR WATER. AND A GOOD STAFF. ARE ON POINT. THERE'S NOTHING DREAMY THIS ABOUT THIS AT ALL. THE COGENT WELL SUPPORTED AND I AM UNEQUIVOCALLY STATE THEY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. THEY MUST ALL BE THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO PURSUE THIS IN A STATUTORY WAY RATHER THAN REGULATION. OR DEPARTMENT OPERATION MANUAL. THIS HAS GOT TO BE STATUTORY FROM THE LEGISLATURE. WHERE THE COURSE THE SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE GOVERNOR. MISTER BOB CHERISH IS HERE WITH US WITH YOUR INDULGENCE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS IF YOU COULD COMMENT. AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE SOME OTHER WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT MISTER BOB CHERISH THIS YEAR. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR ROOM MISTER HARRIS. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BOB HARRIS FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I WAS A PROJECT MANAGER ON OUR TWO MOST RECENT AUDITS OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- AS A MATTER OF POLICY WE DON'T TAKE A FORMAL POSITION ON BILLS BUT ALL PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE WAYS THAT SB TWO THIRTY TWO ADDRESSES KEY CONCERNS THAT WE HAD COMING OUT OF THOSE AUDITS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE RELATED TO THEM. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- JUST HIGHLIGHT TWO AREAS OF THE BILL AND THEN TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE THE FIRST IS IN THE AREA OF RECESSION PLANNING WE FOUND THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC ET DE DID NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE RECESSION PLAN IN OTHER WORDS IT HAD NO COMPREHENSIVE PREPAREDNESS FOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN- IF AN ECONOMIC RECESSION OCCURRED AS WE KNOW. DEMAND FOR EDIE'S- NEEDED ASSISTANCE INCREASES IN TIMES OF RECESSION SO- BE GIVEN THE REGULAR NATURE OF THOSE RECESSIONS GIVEN SOME OF THE PAST HISTORY EDT- STRUGGLES THAT EDS HAD IN THE PAST RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO INCREASES IN DEMAND WERE RECOMMENDING THAT THEY BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE COMPREHENSIVELY FOR WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT A RECESSION CAUSES AN INCREASE IN DEMAND. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DO SO THE SECONDARY ALL COVER AND THEN TAKE QUESTIONS IN THE AREA OF. FRAUD ANALYSIS ESSENTIALLY KNOWING FOR CERTAIN THAT THE FRAUD PREVENTION TECHNIQUES EDT USERS ARE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING FRAUD THEY HAD NO SUCH ASSESSMENT WHEN WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THEM TO DO REGULAR FRAUD EFFECT FRAUD PREVENTION EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENTS IN A IN OTHER WORDS THEY SHOULD KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE STOPPING AS MUCH FRAUD AS POSSIBLE AND ALSO NOT UNDULY DELAYING LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS FROM RECEIVING THEIR BENEFITS BY USING. AN EFFECTIVE FRAUD PREVENTION TECHNIQUE. AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED WE ALSO RECOMMENDED DIRECTLY TO EDT THAT THEY CONSOLIDATE THEIR FRAUD PREVENTION OPERATIONS INTO A SINGLE UNIT DOING SO WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH FRAUD PREVENTION BEST PRACTICES I WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CENTRALLY ON OPERATOR FROM. PREVENT OPERATIONS AND WITH THAT I'LL TAKE ANY OF THE QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE I HAVE. THANK YOU OF THE SERVICE WE'RE GONNA PROCEED TO TAKE- SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES- IN FRONT TIME ALLOWS FOR YOU YOU WANT TO STAND BY THERE MAY BE QUESTIONS WE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND- I JUST REMIND US.

THERE ARE NO COMMENTS IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND- SEE IF THERE'S SO IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS BILL- SENATOR RUSSELL. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SERVE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR OR FOR MISTER HARRIS- I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE- WE HAD THIS HEARING. AND SO MUCH INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED FOR US AS MUCH AS COULD BE- ARE FROM THE STATE AUDITOR- WE ALSO HAVE THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM ANOTHER. ANOTHER SORT OF GROUP TO EVALUATE AND JUDGE OF WHAT HAPPENED. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF BIG PIECES CONNECTED TO THIS THIS IS THE- PREPARING IT WAS- PUT UP A PLAN TO BE PARRIS FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND YET AT THE SAME TIME ALL WHEN THERE'S LITTLE USE OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE THE LEAST RESOURCES ON THERE SO TO PREPARE FOR THAT ANYWAY THEY WERE ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE E. D. D. WHAT COULD OF WHAT WENT WRONG WHAT WHAT COULD WE DO ABOUT IT- I'M NOT SURE HERE- WITH THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS. AND NOW- THE SENATOR'S PROPOSAL IS. HOW DO WE COMPARE. HOW CAN WE FIGURE OUT HERE WHAT'S BEING TAKEN UP FROM ALL THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHAT'S BEEN LEFT OUT. ON IT'S KIND OF LIKE A PUZZLE EVERYTHING HAS TO FIT IN AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WERE SORT OF PICKING AND CHOOSING PIECES OF IT. BUT SOMETIMES THE PIECES DON'T ALWAYS ADD UP TO THE FULL PICTURE OF HOW WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD SO I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE PICK AND CHOOSE- FOR THEIR ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM EITHER THE STRIKE TEAM. OR THE AUDIT THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BILL WHICH ONES ARE THEY WHY AREN'T THEY INCLUDED. ON OUR THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN IN THE AUDIT THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED TODAY SO I JUST FEEL LIKE- I'M NOT. SURE I HAVE THE FULL. BENEFIT OF THE FULL PICTURE HERE. THE IN ORDER FOR NAY I WOULD LIKE TO DO FOR. SOURCE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT I THINK MISTER HARRIS CAN GIVE US A BETTER ANSWER MAYBE THE NóI THOSE WHO SERVICE IF YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO ATTEMPT A CONCISE RESPONSE TO- SENATOR OFFICES- EXCELLENT A POINT SCORING NUMBER VARIAS PLEASE DO SO AND THEN WE'LL TURN TO SENATOR LAYERED FOR HIS COMMENTS THANK YOU MR CHERRY YES SO- IF THERE IS SOME OVERLAP THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY OUR AUDIT DON'T DO NOT OVERLAP- ONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF. THIS BILL THAT WE SHARE WITH THE STRAIGHT TEAM- IN TERMS OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS RELATED TO THE I. T. SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT- THE SENATORS INCLUDED IN HIS BILL ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH IS THE SAME AS THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT EDT NEEDS TO START PRIORITIZING THE PARTS OF THAT PROJECT THAT CAN BEST SERVE CALIFORNIANS SO THE GOVERNOR'S STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROJECT BE PAUSED RECONSIDERED WE'VE SAID AS YOU RECONSIDER PLEASE. PRIORITIZE THE PARTS THAT CAN BE DONE MOST QUICKLY AND THAT CAN HELP CALIFORNIANS THE SOONEST SO I THINK THERE'S SOME GOOD OVERLAP BETWEEN US AND THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM THERE WITH RESPECT TO OUR THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE THAT ARE NOT IN THIS BILL YES THERE ARE SOME- THIS BILL DOES IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS. VIRTUALLY VERBATIM AS THE SENATOR SAID- AND SOME OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE ONCE OF THE NEED FOR RECESSIONARY PLANNING- AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE- THINGS ARE TIGHT THAT EDT NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO BEST MANAGE LIMITED RESOURCES- WHEN INCREASED DEMAND OCCURS- SAME THING FOR FRAUD PREVENTION EFFECTIVENESS- IT'S EATING STAFF A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOWALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS IT DOES TO PREVENT FRAUD ARE WORKING TOGETHER. OR NOT WORKING TOGETHER IDEALLY. THANK YOU. HOME SOON DRAWS ON IT BEFORE YOU SEE THE FOUR ONE MAKE SURE YOU CHECK AND SEE. I REALLY APPRECIATE- THE AUTHORS. EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS ARE I WOULD STILL SOMEHOW I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE MISTER CHAIR. HOW WE WOULD GET THE COMPARISON SO WE COULD SEE WHAT'S MISSING AND WHAT'S BEING ADDRESSED I DON'T HAVE THE IMPRESSION. THAT OKAY THIS IS DEALING WITH EVERYTHING AND THEN COME BACK AND SAY NO THEIR THIS WAS MISSING THIS WAS MISSING. FOR IT- THE BILL CONTAINS THINGS THAT MAYBE DON'T MAKE SENSE ARE COMPARED TO THE OTHER PIECES SO IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT WE COULD. I COULD GET THAT PROVIDED ALL THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR TODAY I WOULD. I WOULD SUPPORT BUT- I'M HOLDING ON TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE IN FOR HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO. DRAWS ARE THERE ARE MANY DEALS AND MANY IDEAS WELL NOT AS MANY AS I EXPECTED THERE MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF THE ANGER OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THE BUT THAT SAID. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOR THAT'S OUR JOB THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES WE NEED AND WE CONSIDER. FIVE SET TO THE LONG EIGHTY HEARINGS AS WELL. AND HEARD MANY IDEAS. ALL OF WHICH I LISTEN TO NONE OF US ARE NOT SOME OF WHICH I TOOK VERY SERIOUSLY OTHERS I DID NOT. BUT THAT'S OUR JOB AND THERE'S THE BILL'S PROGRESS BILLS PLURAL. THEN LEAVE THEM TO COLLECTIVELY THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR COMMITTEE STRUCTURES. THERE ARE LEADERSHIP NEGOTIATIONS WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN SOME CASES. WE WILL THEN AS WE USUALLY DO COME UP WITH THE FINAL SOLUTION. I EXPECT TO BE MORE THAN ONE BILL. BUT I DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING WE DO. THIS YEAR. MAY BE ENOUGH. THIS IS TAKEN DECADES TO GET THIS TANGLED UP AS IT HAS BEEN. BUT MY POINT IS WE MUST ACT WE OUGHT TO THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA ACT. EXPEDITIOUSLY AND THAT WOULD MEAN BY THE END OF THE SESSION. YOU SENATOR- CENTER LAYERED THANK YOU TOM. LET ME OFFER. A LITTLE LIGHT OF. THE B. BECAUSE- I'M ON J. LACK IN THE VICE CHAIR WE HAD A HERE THERE WAS AN AUDIT. A AND- THERE WERE AS I RECALL TWO MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THIS BILL HAS THE RECESSION PLANNING BECAUSE I'M DOING THAT BILL IT IS A BIPARTISAN BILL AND IT BASICALLY SAYS WITH THE RECOMMENDATION THAT CAME FROM THE AUDITOR THAT WE WOULD PUT THAT IN THE STATUTE. BECAUSE THERE WAS THE GREAT RECESSION AND A SIMILAR THING HAPPENED TEN YEARS AGO WITH THE D. D. THERE WAS AN AUDIT REPORT THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR IT WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED IT- THE MELTDOWN NEGATIVE RECOMMENDATION CAME UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN IT WASNOT IMPLEMENTED THEN THIS HAPPENED. UNDER GOVERNOR KNOWS SOME. AND WE DON'T TO FACE ANOTHER. WITHOUT THERE EVER BEING A PLAN THAT IS IN PLACE BEFORE HAND TO SCALE UP WHEN THAT HAPPENS SO WE DON'T HAVE WHAT HAPPENED HERE. BUT HAVEN'T I WAS NOT CONSIDERING THAT THERE MIGHT BE THINGS IN THE STRIKE TEAM. ARE THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN ADDITION TO THE AUDIT THAT WOULD BE AN BILLS BECAUSE I THINK. THE TWO MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE INCORPORATED BETWEEN THIS BILL AND THE BILL ON TO WHEN. THERE'S A STRIKE TEAM AND THE PLACE THAT THERE RE A TON OF BILLS ARE COMING OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY. BUT THEY HAVE DONE A COMPLETE PACKAGE AND THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY THINGS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE AUDIT TO OUR- PEOPLE DID THEIR OWN THINGS AND SO I THINK. TO BE RESPONSIVE TO SENATOR DORADO WHICH IS THE RIGHT QUESTION. IS IF THERE MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE STRIKE TEAM AND THEIR STUFF MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS OUT OF THE AUDIT THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BE EASILY CROSS REFERENCED WITH THE BILLS. TO FIND OUT WHAT'S INCLUDED AND WHAT'S MISSING I JUST KNOW THE MAJOR ONES THAT WERE IN THE AUDIT OR IN BILLS THAT ARE MOVING I DON'T KNOW. ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE- CONSTRUCTING RECOMMENDATIONS AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE ASSEMBLY BILLS AREN'T THINGS THAT WEREN'T IN EITHER OF THE OTHER DAY ARE REALLY TRYING TO STRIKE OUT. AND DEAL WITH THAT SO I THINK. THE FAIR QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET AN OVERALL LOOKS OF THAT WE DON'T HAVE A BILL COME BY AND WE TAKE ACTION PIECEMEAL WHICH I THINK IS YOUR POINT AND IT IS THE RIGHT POINT. AND IT'S UNPREPARED TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. ARE BECAUSE OF WHAT IT DOES IN RELATION THE AUDIT AND I HAVE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT DID NOT OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL THAT DOES STUFF. THE A RECESSION PLAN TO I THINK THE QUESTION IS AND I DON'T KNOW WHO DOES IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S- STAFF OF OUR COMMITTEE. FOR PEOPLE IN GENERAL I CAN HELP WITH THE ORDER COULD HELP BUT IT JUST NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND MAYBE COMING OUT OF THIS WE CAN MAKE SURE SO THAT BEFORE WE SEE. THIS BILL AGAIN SOMEWHERE OR ANOTHER BILL WE HAVE A FLAVOR. FOR WHAT THAT SITUATION IS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED ANY OTHER COMMENTS THAT APPEARED MEMBERS WOULD ARGUE THAT. WE ARE WE CAN'T JUST WALLOW IN EVERYTHING IS IN PROCESS IT IS A PROCESS THAT THE LEAD PROCESS. ONE BILL DOESN'T HAVE TO DO IT ALL. I DON'T EXPECT IT TO. AND THERE WILL BE NEGOTIATIONS AS WE PROCEED. THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE ARE THESE POLICIES SATISFACTORY TO THE COMMITTEE WILL THEY HELP THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE THEY BEEN OFFERED. BY A CREDIBLE SOURCE I DO NOT THINK YOU COULD FIND A MORE CREDIBLE SOURCE THEN WE HAVE FOR THE PROVISIONS AREA. AND WHATEVER BILL SHOULD COME TOGETHER AS WE PROCEED. THAT'S HOW WE WILL VOTE IN ACCORD WITH WHAT IS BEFORE US AT THE TIME. THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS IN FACT THAT. PEOPLE WORKING PROCESS ARE WE DONE WITH THIS BILL HEAVENS NO LONG WAY TO GO BUT I WOULD ASK THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE COMMITTEE TO BROUGH TO SO LONG AS A SOUND WELL THOUGHT OUT SUPPORTABLE VESSEL. AS WE PROCEED IN LEGISLATION TO HELP THE CITIZENS WHO HAVE BEEN SO AGGRIEVED MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED I DON'T THINK THESE COMMENTS WERE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IT'S I THINK PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO MOVE YOUR BILL LONG BECAUSE- FOR WHAT IT IS IT IS GOOD AND IT MEETS A RECOMMENDATION BUT IT IS A REALLY FAIR QUESTION TO SEE HOW THE WHOLE THING FITS TOGETHER. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THINGS THAT DON'T FIT TOGETHER SO IT'S LIKE I'M GOING TO VOTE AT THE RIGHT TIME TO MOVE THE BILL BY REALLY SUPPORT WHAT CENTER DRAWS SO SAID SO THAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT'S THERE ACROSS THE BOARD AND MAKING SURE THAT. IT THAT IT ISN'T THE GOVERNOR FIGURING IT OUT BY WHAT ORDER HE SIGNS BILL SAID TO CHAPTER OUT THINGS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKING US. QUESTIONS AS THE BILLS CAME BY. THE CENTER LANE. I DO- HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS- SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES IN THE EDT INCLUDED OUTDATED AND ARCHAIC TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY UPGRADE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES PROBLEMS WITH CLAIMS PROCESSING AND THE DELIVERY OF BENEFITS PROBLEMS WITH RESPONDING TO CUSTOMER ENQUIRIES AND ASSISTING CUSTOMERS WITH CLAIMS AND PROBLEMS WITH FRAUD DETECTION AND PREVENTION. AS I UNDERSTAND HAD THE PROVISIONS IN SB TWO THIRTY TO COME DRECTLY FROM RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE RECENT STATE AUDIT REPORT ON THE ED'S FAILURES DURING THE PANDEMIC. GIVING YOUR EXPERTISE- AND FAMILIARITY WITH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS CAN YOU BRIEFLY WALK ME THROUGH- THE MAJOR PROVISIONS THE PROBLEM THEY ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS. AND HOW DO YOU ENVISION THEM ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. YES MANAGER SO THE MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE BILL START WITH THE WHAT I MENTIONED BEFORE WHICH IS THE BENEFITS SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT TO CD'S LONGSTANDING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS TO PROJECTS TO MODERNIZE ITS SYSTEMS SO THAT THEY'RE MORE CUSTOMER FRIENDLY. AND THAT THEY WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY FOR EDT THE PROJECT HAS BEEN IN PROCESS FOR A LONG TIME- AND WASN'T SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- AS I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM RECOGNIZED THAT THE SYSTEM- MODERNIZATION PROJECT NEEDED TO BE PAUSED AND RESTOCKED. WE AGREE WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO EDT THAT THEY RETHINK THE PROJECT WITH A PRIORITY ON THE COMPONENT PARTS OF IT THAT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL TO CALIFORNIANS AND THE QUICKEST AMOUNT OF TIME IN THIS BILL. IMPLEMENTS THAT RECOMMENDATION BY REQUIRING EDT TO PRIORITIZE THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT. THE NEXT MAJOR AREA OF THE BILL IS THE CALL CENTER OPERATIONS IT ASKS EDT TO HAVE BETTER DATA ABOUT WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR ASSISTANCE SO THAT THEY CAN BE SERVED THROUGH NON CALL CENTER- AVENUES SO THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. TO GET THEIR BENEFITS MORE TIMELY WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT ON HOLD OR AND NOT ACTUALLY EVEN GET THROUGH TO A CALL CENTER AGENT. SAID THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE EDT TO UNDERTAKE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION COLLECTION. ASSESSMENT AND IN RESPONSE TO THAT ASSESSMENT. IN CHANGES TO ITS OPERATIONS TO BETTER SERVE THOSE WERE LOOKING FOR HELP. FOUR AUTHORED AT RECOMMENDING IN THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE EDT TO TRACK FIRST CALL RESOLUTION WHICH IS- MET AN INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICE METRIC WHICH WOULD- TELL EDT WHETHER IT'S SUCCESSFULLY ASSISTING PEOPLE THE FIRST TIME TO CALL FOR ASSISTANCE. SO THAT'S AN INDUSTRY STANDARD PRACTICE OF HOW WELL YOUR CALL CENTER OPERATES IF SOMEONE HAS TO CALL YOU MORE THAN ONCE THEN THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAVE TO LEARN FROM BUT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT TRACKING NOT AT ALL. SO THEY NEED TO START TRACKING AND MONITORING WHETHER THEY'RE SUCCESSFULLY ASSISTING. CLAIMANTS WHO CALLED THE FIRST TIME I CALL. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DO SO. THE BILL THEN REQUIRES EDT TO DEVELOP A RECESSION PLAN- IN LINE WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LESSONS LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC PERIOD BUT ALSO PAST RECESSIONS. AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY EARLIER TO BE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR THAT TIMELY ASSISTANCE THAT PEOPLE NEED. WHICH HAPPENS WHEN A RECESSION OCCURS. THEY SHOULD ALSO UPDATE THAT PLAN REGULARLY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DO. FINAL AREA THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO TAKE ACTION ON IS IN THE AREA FRAUD PREVENTION. AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY THEY HAD NO ASSESSMENT OF HOW EFFECTIVELY THEY ARE PREVENTING FRAUD WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE COMPONENT THINGS THAT THEY DO TO TRY AND PREVENT FRAUD. ARE BOTH ON THEIR OWN EFFECTIVE OR NOT. AND THAT THEY'RE WORKING WELL TOGETHER OR NOT. I NEED TO COMPILE THAT ASSESSMENT PROVIDED TO LEGISLATURE REFRESH ANNUALLY- REGULARLY. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DO FINALLY AS I MENTIONED THEY ALSO NEED TO CONSOLIDATE. THEIR FRAUD PREVENTION APPROACH INTO A SINGLE UNIT THAT'S WHAT. FRAUD PREVENTION BEST PRACTICES RECOMMEND IT'S NOT WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE DID THE AUDIT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO ADOPT OUR RECOMMENDATION. PERFECT THIRD JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. PURPOSES THIS BILL. RECESSION PLANNING AREA. AND TO BE FRIED- EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FRAUD PREVENTION APPROACH THERE'S A QUITE FOUNDATIONAL AREAS- THE EDT NEEDS TO MAKE ADVANCES ON. THAT COMPREHENSIVE RECESSION PLAN WILL ALLOW EDG TO KNOW. THAT WHEN DEMAND STARTS TO INCREASE FOR ITS ASSISTANCE. HOW IT'S GOING TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY SO IT DOESN'T. NEED TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IN A IN A SORT OF EMERGENCY MOMENT- IT'LL BE PREPARED IF IT DOES SUCH A PLAN. TO KNOW HOW'S IT GOING TO QUICKLY SCALE IT STAFF UP. WHAT AREAS OF ITS OPERATIONS CAN TEMPORARILY SCALED BACK AND NOT EXPERIENCE ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS. SO THOSE ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT PLANNING STEPS THAT THEY NEED TO UNDERTAKE AND SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS. WEAKNESSES THAT THEY KNOW THEY HALF THAT THEY'VE HEARD ABOUT FOR YEARS NOW. IN IN THE FRAUD PREVENTION EFFECTIVENESS. RIGHT NOW HE DOESN'T KNOW IF IT'S USING AN EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO PREVENT FRAUD. SO IT NEEDS TO KNOW WHETHER IT COULD BE ALLOWING US WE SAW SOME FRAUDULENT CLAIMS TO PASS THROUGH AND GET PAID- HOW CAN IT FINE TUNE ITS TOOLS TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN FINALLY. IS IT PREVENTING UNDULY LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS BY CATCHING THEM IN A FRAUD PREVENTION TOOL THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY VERY EFFECTIVE AT DETECTING FRAUD INSTEAD IT'S- A SITE TRACKING LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. TO DOING THAT ANALYSIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THE TWO PRETTY FOUNDATIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE BILL. WONDERFUL S. THIS BILL HAS A NUMBER OF IMPLEMENTATION DATES THAT ARE OVER A YEAR FROM NOW IN YOUR VIEW. ARE THESE STATE APPROPRIATE. AND WHAT WOULD BE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENSURING THAT EDT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTS THESE pCERTAINLY WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE SAID WE PUT DEADLINES ON OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL- AND SOME OF THESE ARE FURTHER OUT THAN THE RECOMMENDED DATES THAT WE SET BUT CERTAINLY THE BILLS WELL WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE SAID WHICH IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE DATE CERTAIN- THAT BY WHICH EDT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HAVING COMPLETED THE ACTIONS. AND. AND THE ISSUE OF ENSURING THAT EDT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTS THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT- SO FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE BILL ADOPTS THAT WE HAVE ALSO MADE DIRECTLY TO EDT OUR OFFICE DES A FOLLOW UP AND REPORT PUBLICLY ENSURES INFORMATION OF THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE PROGRESS THE DEPARTMENT MAKES IN IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE DIRECTLY TO EDT AND THE BILL DOES TAKE SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WOOD. IF PASSED INTO LAW AS IS HE WOULD GRADUATE THEM TO STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS NOT JUST RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE TO THE DEPARTMENT BUT EVEN SO WILL STILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE V. D. TO SEE WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO ADDRESS THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE DIRECTLY TO THEM WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE PARTS OF THE BILL. THEY ARE RECOMMENDATIONS WE NEED TO THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTLY BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THEM BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE HISTORY WITH EDT WE FELT THEY NEEDED TO BE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FROM THEN- WE WOULD OPINE ABOUT WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE TOOK THE ACTIONS WE RECOMMENDED- AND MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE FOR- FOLLOW UP REVIEW. OKAY IN A MINUTE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HEARING YOU'RE THE EXPERT- GIVEN THAT THESE ISSUES WERE KNOWN. WHY IN YOUR VIEW DIDN'T EDTA TRUSTEES ISSUES IN THE INTERVENING YEARS BETWEEN THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE OFFICE OF COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE EIGHTY CONTENDS THAT IT DID TAKE ACTION IN THE YEARS BETWEEN THE RECESSION AND THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC- IT DID TAKE SOME ACTIONS TO MODERNIZE ITS PROCESSES FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN NOW APPLY FOR BENEFITS ONLINE. OUR POSITION IS THAT THOSE CHANGES TO ITS OPERATIONS WERE NOT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH EVEN IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE PANDEMIC EDIE'S PERFORMANCE WAS SUBSTANTIVELY SIMILAR TO IT'S- PAST PER FOR PERFORMANCE. SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH EDT TOOK NO ACTION IT JUST DIDN'T TAKE SUFFICIENT ACTION TO ADDRESS ITS PERFORMANCE- AND THAT ULTIMATELY ENDED UP. HINDERING IT FROM EFFECTIVELY SERVING CALIFORNIANS DURING THE PANDEMIC WE ACKNOWLEDGE. IN THE AUDIT IT'S MULTIPLE TIMES THAT THE SCOPE SPAN AND SPEED OF THE PANDEMIC RECESSION WAS COMPLETELY UNPRECEDENTED. SO NOTHING THEY DID WAS GOING TO PREPARE THEM FULLY FOR THE PANDEMIC RECESSION. AT THE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PREPARED THAN THEY WERE. PERFECT AND- RIGHT NOW COULD YOU PROVIDE US AN UPDATE ON THE CURRENT PROGRESS- BASED ON THE EDT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS UP TO THIS POINT NOT AT THIS TIME EDIE'S FIRST RESPONSE BACK TO US ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS DUE THIS WEEK SO WILL RECEIVE IT THIS WEEK TO A FAST ASSESSMENT NOW WE'LL GET COMMITTEE THAT INFORMATION. WONDERFUL PERFECT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY I DO HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL. SENATOR LAYERED HAS MOVED TO THE- S. B. TWO THIRTY TWO.

WELCOME CENTER RUBIO. YOU MAY BE BETTER PRESENTED ON S. B. ZERO FIVE WOULD HAVE PUT YOUR COME FROM BEGINNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. TODAY I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT THROUGH A LOT OF HARD WORK AND COLLABORATION THIS BILL REFLECTS THE WELL. OF ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO CAME TO THE TABLE. I HAVE GOT IT THE ORIGINAL BILL AND NOW TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS NO LONGER AN AB FIVE EXEMPTION. IT REFLECTS THE GOAL OF THE ORIGINAL BILL BUT ALSO TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION. AS WELL AS MANY IDEAS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD. THIS BILL DOES TWO CRITICAL THINGS FIRST ESTABLISHES A GRANT PROGRAM FOR SMALL PERFORMING ARTS NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATIONS THESE FUNDS ARE MEANT TO HELP COMPLY WITH AB FIVE. THE BILL CLEARLY SPELLS OUT OF GRADUATION ANTHONY LEVELS THE MORE THE NONPROFIT'S MAKE THE LESS THEY QUALIFY FOR AND RIGHTFULLY SO WE WANT TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE SMALLEST OF THEATERS. NEXUS BILL CREATED ENTITY WITH STATE GOVERNMENT TO HELP WITH PAYROLL PROCESSING SERVICES THAT CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. BY CREATING THIS THESE NONPROFITS ARE ABLE TO GET DOWN. ON OPERATIONS AND AN OVERHEAD HELPING THEM SURVIVE. POLITICS THIS ISSUE AS I'VE EXPRESSED MANY OF YOU IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME THIS IS NOT JUST THE BILL BUT IT BECAME MY LIFE I GREW UP IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF DRUGS. GANGS AND VIOLENCE. EVERYWHERE YOU SAW OUR FRIENDS FAMILIES GOT PULLED INTO IT. I JUST HAPPENED TO BE A VERY CREATIVE CHILD. VERY ARTISTIC AND THE ART BECAME MY A STATE. AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE AROUND A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT EMBRACE THE ACT ALL THE ENOUGH. I WAS AROUND RIGHT BASS SAID O'NEILL SAID ONO GODFATHER THERE ONCE- ONCE STARTED TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND WHAT I SAW. ON SAW THEM FIFTY AND BRACE BILLS WITHOUT EXPERIENCE. I THOUGHT HOW THEY CREATED A SAFE PLACE FOR KIDS ARGUES AND ACTORS TO. PRACTICE AND REALLY HONE IN ON THE SKILLS IT REALLY GIVE A VOICE TO EVERYONE THEY WANTED TO GET A START IN THIS FIELD. BUT IT'S HARD NOT TO SEE THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT JUST ABOUT AXIS IN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IT'S ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE AS WELL. BERMAN ARTS HAVE BEEN A POWERFUL TOOL FOR THE VOICELESS HISTORICALLY MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY HAVE USED PERFORMING ARTS TO ELEVATE THEIR CALLS AND HELP SHAPE POLICY. FROM THE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT WHEN THEY USED TO USE PLACE TO ENGAGE AKRON WOMEN TO JOIN THE COST AND HELP THEM FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. TO BUT THERE WERE RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THAT ERA WAS REFERRED TO AS THE ERA OF CREATIVE ACTIVISM THEY USE IMAGERY POETRY SPOKEN WORD ANYTHING MAKE IT USED TO ELEVATE THEIR COSTS AND HELPED SHAPE POLICY THAT WILL HELP BETTER THEIR LIFE TO BE A BILL CAMPESINO WHICH STARTED IN THE FIELD FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH FARMWORKERS THESE ARE FOLKS FIGHTING FOR OPPORTUNITY FOR BETTER SALARIES I KNOW MY FATHER WAS A FARM WORKER. SO IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT PERFORMING ARTS PEOPLE HAD IN HAND. WITH WHAT THE MOVEMENT AND IT'S CRITICAL TO THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY AT A LOCAL LEVEL I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THAT THE FUNDING FOR ARTS IN OUR SCHOOLS IS DISAPPEARING I WAS A TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW MUCH PARTS WE HAD WHEN I STARTED NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO AND WHERE WE'RE AT NOW OUR CHILDREN ARE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO WHAT THEY NEED TO BECOME WELL ROUNDED INDIVIDUALS. AND I PERSONALLY DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO A TIME WHERE THE ARTS THEATER IS ONLY FOR THE WEALTHY WE SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO THE BILL'S IN INNER CITY COMMUNITIES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER SEE A PLAY A SHALL BE INTRIGUED BY THE POSSIBILITIES THE ARTS CREATE OPPORTUNITIES IT OPENS DOORS ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN LIKE MYSELF WHERE ARE YOU SAW WITH NOTHING BUT NEGATIVE ELEMENTS. PLEASE HELP ME. SAY SMALL. TODAY WITH ME I'M HONORED TO HAVE TWO DISTINGUISHED GUESTS WITH ME FIRST I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE. THE FETAL BIRTH AND AWARD WINNING PLAYWRIGHT WHO ROLLED WILL ROOM WITH REAL WOMEN HAVE CURVES.

I ALSO WROTE IT TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT I WAS UNDOCUMENTED AND I GOT AMNESTY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND IT BECAME A LEGAL RESIDENT- THIS PLAYED A ROLE BECAME A HUGE SUCCESS WITH OVER A HUNDRED PRODUCTIONS THROUGHOUT THE US. IT ALSO THE FILM HAS- HAS BEEN INDUCTED INTO THE NATIONAL REGISTRY AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS BECAUSE OF ITS CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE AND ITS CULTURAL VALUE. ADD THIS FILM WAS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE FEW pMUSEUM OF THE MOTION PICTURE ACADEMY. BUT WHEN I WAS GETTING STARTED AS A WRITER AND I WAS TRYING TO GET THIS PLAY PRODUCED. NOBODY WOULD PRODUCE MY PLAYING ANOTHER BIG THEATERS WILL PRODUCE MY PLATE IT WAS A LOT OF RACIST THINGS ABOUT WHAT THE NOSE. AND I GOT SO SICK AND TIRED OF IT. DID I DECIDED TO PRODUCE MY OWN PLACE. LET'S START MY OWN THEATER COMPANY. HOW IS IT FAIR THAT LATINOS OF THE MAJORITY IN LOS ANGELES. AND YET WE ARE INVISIBLE IN CINEMA TV AND THEATRE AS YOU CAN TELL BY THE OSCARS WE WEREN'T THERE. I STARTED MY OWN SMALL THEATER. SO THAT I CAN TELL STORIES ABOUT LATINOS SO THAT I CAN EDUCATE MY COMMUNITY TO TELL OUR STORIES. I GET VERY EMOTIONAL ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE TO SAVE MY LIFE.

AND THAT WE ARE BEING HEARD AND THAT WE ARE VISIBLE. IT HAS BEEN MY SMALL PETER HAS BEEN MY WAY OF CREATING A COMMUNITY SO WE CAN ALSO HEAR THE TRAUMA THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH DRAMA IN MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT USED TO BE KNOWN AS THE GANG CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES. SMALL THEATERS ARE THE ONLY WAY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES GET THEIR STORIES TOLD. SMALL FEEDERS ALLOW FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR TO HAVE THEIR DREAMS COME TRUE BECAUSE WE GET TO SEE THEM ON STAGE IT WILL WE SEE OURSELVES AS THE PROTAGONIST OF OUR LIVES WE GET TO SEE BE TE HEROES BECAUSE WE'RE TIRED OF PLAYING THE VILLAINS WE ARE TIRED OF BEING THEM WE WANT TO SEE OURSELVES REPRESENTED. IN THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN. SENATORS SMALL FEEDERS ARE ESSENTIAL TO TELL STORIES. I'VE STRUGGLED. REPRESENTATION JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. I'M SORRY I GET SO EMOTIONAL BUT TO ME IT'S MORE THAN JUST OF. IT IS SIGNIFICANT LITTLE THING YOU KNOW THIS IS MY LIFE. THERE'S SO MUCH INJUSTICE AT LEAST EVERY COULD TELL STORIES WHERE WE GET SOME KIND OF JUSTICE IN ON STAGE. THESE WARM SUPER HEART TO KEEP FIGHTING.

THANK YOU EDUARDO MARTINEZ WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION- WE'RE HERE WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION- ONE TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT MOVE THIS BILL AWAY FROM AN EIGHTY FIVE EXEMPTION AND TOWARDS A PAYMENT PAGEMASTER CONCEPT AN IDEA THAT MANY OF OUR UNIONS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR SOME TIME. WHAT WE ARE STILL IN OPPOSITION WERE COMFORTABLE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AT THE BILL MOVES AND COMMITTEE TODAY- ADMITTED B. YOU DON'T. HATCHER PROMISE TREMENDOUS PROMISE TO NOT ONLY IF THEY'RE STRUGGLING COMMUNITY LEADERS. BUT ALSO THE BROADER THEATER WORKFORCE MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN OUT OF WORK MUCH OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND WE'RE RESPECTFULLY ASKING SENATOR RUBIO AND THE COMMITTEE TO WORK WITHOUT AN ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE AMENDMENT OR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THAT ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THE THAT THE- PUBLIC WENT UP BUT- SUPPORTED WITNESSES STATED- IF I COULD JUST ALUMINUM RIGHT SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. NUMBER ONE WE WANT TO SEE WE'RE SEEKING CLARIFICATION IN THE BILL THAT NOTHING CHANGES THE EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF THE THEATER EMPLOYEES. SPECIFICALLY WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES RECEIVE THEIR WAGES IF PAYMASTER ENTITY THE REMAINING CLEAN OF THE CATERING WHICH THEY WORK. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT IT KNOWLEDGE IS THOSE COMMUNITIES THEATERS THAT HAVE ALREADY DONE RIGHT BY THEIR WORKERS. EITHER BY ENTERING INTO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT CREATING HIGH ROAD CAREER PATHWAYS OR SOME OTHER INVESTMENT IN THEIR WORKFORCE- THIRD WE'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT A DIFFERENT ENTITY OTHER THAN THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. GOVERNED BURKE DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUND. MANY GREAT EXAMPLES OF JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED GRANT PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. AND LASTLY WE'D LIKE TO WE'D LIKE THEATERS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THEIR APPLICATION ABOUT THEIR WORK FORCE. REACHED IN DATA POINTS LIKE HOW MANY W. TWO EMPLOYEES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT THE THEATER HAVE. A DOES THE THEATER HAVE DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION POLICIES AND HOW BIGGER ISSUES AND OF.

AND SHE'S WORKED HARD ON THIS ONE AND THERE STILL WAS THE OPPOSE US AMENDED FROM THE LABOR FEDERATION WHICH ACTUALLY SAID THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND SO- ARE OUR HIGH AM PREPARED TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. AND I THINK THAT THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT- FRANKLY COME HELL OR HIGH WATER OF THE AUTHOR'S GOING TO MAKE THIS WORK AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT FORMULATION TO SHE FINALLY GOT TO DO THAT AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY. TO GET THERE AND- I THINK THAT THE IF THIS ONE DOESN'T QUITE WORK AND SHE CAN FIGURE OUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT ACCOMPLISHES THE PURPOSE MORE POWER TO. ED WE DID TODAY WE CAN JUST GIVE HER THE OPTION OF CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS AND MEETING THE GOAL THIS BILL SO I'LL BE PREPARED T MOVE IT WHENEVER. WE GET TO THAT TIME. CERVERA'S OF. YES ARM. ARE ONE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL WORK THAT AUTHOR HAS DONE I KNOW WE HAD A- LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND- I KNOW THERE'S A GOAL THAT. SHE'S EXPLAINED TO ME THAT SHE HAS IN MIND.

VERY MUCH A SUPPORTER OF THE LOCAL ARTS- AND I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT FOR THE NONPROFIT PERFORMING ARTS CENTER SPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC THIS BILL HOWEVER IT IN MY OPINION IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM THIS INTERCITY CANNOT SURVIVE UNDER THE RESTRICTIONS OF AB FIVE AND SHOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM IT. AS A HUNDRED AND SEVEN OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE BEEN. AS THAT WOULD BE THE MOST FEASIBLE AND COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION. FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AS I WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND BE ABLE TO SURVIVE AND- BE ABLE TO FOLLOW WHAT IT IS THAT THEIR INTENT WAS ORIGINALLY. AND FOR THAT I HI- I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT BUT I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD. ON ON THIS EFFORT AND DO WISH YOU. THE VERY BEST AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL.

MEANINGFUL TO ME SOMEONE AT BANKER ON ANIMAL TAKING A LITTLE BIT WHO FLEW UP HERE TO GET HER PERSONAL TESTIMONY. AND YOU KNOW I WAS REALLY MOVED BY HER TESTIMONY AND HER. APOLOGIZING FOR GETTING EMOTIONAL BUT- I DON'T SEE WHY SHE SHOULD APOLOGIZE I'VE KNOWN HER FIFTEEN A FOR MANY YEARS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS WHEN SHE STARTED HER THEATER.

SENATOR TORONTO II CENTER LAYERED HI CENTER LAYERED HI SENATOR NEWMAN. CENTER NEWMAN HI. THE TO ONE SO THE BILL IS A THANK YOU FOR YOUR MESSAGE. BUT BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO. OUR LAST BILL FROM. EINEM HE MAYBE WE WILL GO AHEAD I WAS GOING WITH THE CALL BUT WHEN WE GO AHEAD AND- IT MOVED TO ITEM EIGHT AND THEN WILL A CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS ON PRIOR- PRIOR VOTING AFTER WE HEAR IT SENATE BILL FOR. ONE NINE FOUR NINETEEN SENATOR STERN'S BILL. IS SENATOR STERN. I BELIEVE YOU ARE WITH US REMOTELY TODAY THAT'S- OKAY MISTER CHAIR GOOD OKAY YOU YOU MAY PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS FIRST ONLY THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE ANALYSIS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB FOUR NINETEEN WHICH AT ITS CORE IS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR OIL AND GAS WELLS IN THIS STATE. AND RELYING ON. THE MOST SKILLED WORKERS I DECIDE SUBMIT IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR HERE IN CALIFORNIA- GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK A TRADE AN HONEST DAY'S WORK- BUT IN MAKING OUR COMMUNITY SAFER. IN THE PROCESS. WE KNOW THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY- VERY LARGE OIL OIL PRODUCING STATE AS WELL AS SOME GAS AND MANY OF THESE. OPERATIONS IN LARGE INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN SUMMER IT CLOSER TO NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES BUT- THE KEY IS THAT FOR ALL THAT OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MIDSTREAM SERVICES. THE KIND OF WORK THAT GOES AROUND THE WELL HEAD- WHEN IT COMES TO HOW TO PLUG AND ABANDON A WELL. TO BLOCK IT UP WITH THE- CEMENT DIDN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY AFTER IT'S BEEN COLLUDING IN THE COMMUNITY FOR YEARS OR JUST TO SIMPLY- TIGHTEN UP THE SURROUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THERE NO LEAKS AND THAT- PEOPLE NEARBY ARE KEPT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. THE FACT IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS BY TURN AROUND CONTRACTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE FROM OUT OF STATE. AND I THINK THAT IN CALIFORNIA ARE WORKING PEOPLE ARE THE BEST POSITION TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES SO THAT'S WHY RUNNING THIS LEGISLATION- TO ENSURE THAT- DATE THE BEST SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKERS ARE ABLE TO DO. THE WORK- IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR THAT THE STATE SO DESPERATELY NEEDS- I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PART OF THE AMERICAN JOBS PLANNED ROLLOUT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THEY'RE. REALLY BIG OPPORTUNITY STIFF TO BROKER- I'M LIKE PART. BETWEEN LATE AND FRIENDLY TO ME HERE AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES AND RIGHT NOW THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY MAY SEEM IMPOSSIBLE OR BLEAK OUTLOOK- AND THEN ALSO I DURING THEIR CORNERS BUT I TRULY THINK THAT IF WE- WE PAY DUE RESPECT AND ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE OF THE WORKING PEOPLE AND OIL AND GAS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN ACTUALLY FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND MAKE OURSELVES SAFER IN THE PROCESS SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR ROOM WE WILL MOVE TO LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES- WE HAVE SCOTT WHICH INTERNATIONAL THE ROLEX WORKERS REPRESENTING THEM. HERE IN THE ROOM. AND MARTIN RODRIGUEZ- WHO WILL BE CALLING ON THE COAST TELECONFERENCE ALLIANCE WILL START. MISTER WELCH. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. AND THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS. AS NO EXISTING LAW REQUIRES A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE WITH IN THE REFINERIES DURING TURNAROUND WORK. THAT'S BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY DANGEROUS JOBS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BOILERS- FLAMMABLE GAS HI PRESSURIZED PIPES THAT CARRY GAS OIL. STEAMED VERY DANGEROUS WORK AND THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THE REASON FOR THE REQUIREMENT OF A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE I WOULD LIKE TO NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION SUGGESTS AN AMENDMENT. CERTIFIED ELECTRICIANS WHO ARE CERTIFIED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO QUALIFY AS SKILLED AND TRAINED REGARDLESS IF THEY'VE GRADUATED FROM STATUS APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. GOING OUT THAT YOU CAN BECOME A CERTIFIED ELECTRICIAN THROUGH A TRAINEE PROGRAM. THE MESSAGE TELL THE COMMITTEE THAT A TRAINEE PROGRAMMES DID NOT COME CLOSE TO EQUALISING AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES FIVE YEARS OF INDENTURED SERVITUDE AND- INSTRUCT INTENSE INSTRUCTION IN THE CLASSROOM FOR FIVE YEARS THE REASON WHY THE NONUNION CONTRACTORS. PREFER TRAINEE PROGRAM IS AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENT IN THE MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO TRAINEES. BUT THERE ARE NON UNION- A PRINTER PROGRAMS IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY DON'T GRADUATE ANYBODY SO THEY HAVE A PATHWAY BUT THEY DON'T INVEST A LITTLE GRADUATE THE KIDS THAT'S WHY THEY WANT TO MISDIRECT TOWARDS TRAINING PROGRAMS. LASTLY I WOULD POINT OUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZES APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AS THE HEIGHTENED LOOKED AT THE TOP LEVEL OF TRAINING IS THAT WE REQUIRE THAT ONE AFRAID TO SPEAK POINT FOR EVERY FIGHT JOURNEYMEN ON EVERY SINGLE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT IN THE STATE. THAT IS NOT A STANDARD THAT APPLIES TO ANY OTHER TRAINING PROGRAM. FOR THESE REASONS READ URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU. FOR THE YOU MISTER WILL- MOVING TO- THE HORN RODRIGUEZ.

ARE THERE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF MANBIJ SERIES SO YOU MEAN IN DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT OR QUESTION I DID ME PROCEED S. R. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- I DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD GREATLY. REDUCE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BOTH ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND PROSPERITY FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMPLETED EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS OF WORK AND RECEIVED A LICENSURE THROUGH THE STATE WOULD BE EXCLUDED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY GRADUATED FROM AN ALTERNATIVE APPRENTICE- THIS BILL IS CREATING A SYSTEM OF INEQUITY I WOULD ENSURE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IS NOT AFFORDED TO ALL. MIND YOU N THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE EMPLOYEES HAVE ALREADY PROVEN THEIR MERIT FOR THE JOB. I JUST CAN'T PHANTOM THE LEGISLATURE OUR COMMITTEE STATING THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT WORTHY OF THEIR JOB BECAUSE THEY DID NOT. GO TO SCHOOL. HAVE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WITH A CERTAIN PROGRAM. IN MY PERSONAL OPINION. IT IS APPALLING. FOR THIS REASON HIGH WILL BE NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT SB FOUR NINETEEN. THANK YOU. KAMALA VOTE SURE OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CENTER NEWMAN THANK YOU MISTER SO THERE'S BEEN A BUNCH OF BACK AND FORTH. ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PARTNERSHIP AND I THINK THE CERTIFIED ELECTRICIANS SO WITH FOR MY EDIFICATION ASSUME OTHERS IF WE COULD HAVE MISTER WHICH COME BACK AND CLARIFY IF POSSIBLE TO.

AS A PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD WORKED IN THE LEXICAL FIELD AB WERE OLDER AND HAD GOTTEN THE EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS OF WORK IN THE FIELD BUT HAD NOT GONE THROUGH OFFICIAL TRAINING PROGRAM THEY COULD SIT AND TAKE THE TEST- THOSE STANFORD. A CERTIFICATION LAW DIFFERENTIATES BETWEEN TRAINEES AND APPRENTICES IN SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT WAYS ONE BEING. AN APPRENTICE IN A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. ONE JOURNEYMEN CONSUMER VICE TO APPRENTICES BECAUSE THEY ARE VIEWED AS BEING A HIGHER SKILLED TRAINEE WHEREAS. A TRAINEE HAS TO BE SUPERVISED ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS BY ADJOURNMENT BECAUSE ARE NOT OF THE SAME LEVEL LET ME GIVE YOU AN ANALOGY. YOU CAN SIT FOR THE BAR OF CALIFORNIA YOU CAN READ AND STUDY AND SIT AND TAKE THE BAR. TO BECOME. A LAWYER. LIKE KIM KARDASHIAN IS I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU WANT KIM KARDASHIAN REPRESENTING YOU IN COMPLEX LITIGATION OKAY THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO YES.
