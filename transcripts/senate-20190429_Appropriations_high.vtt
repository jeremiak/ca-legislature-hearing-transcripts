AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU INVEST

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:10.309
IN THIS BOOK PERHAPS IF WE

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:11.677

DEVELOPMENT FOR MAYBE ACTIVE

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:19.485
TRANSPORTATION IF THE FLOOR OF A

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.287
CAP AND TRADE WOULD GO FROM

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:22.288
FIFTEEN DOLLARS TO THIRTY

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.656
DOLLARS THAT WOULD DOUBLE THE

REVENUE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SO

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:25.924
WOULD.

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:27.793
THE CURRENTLY SIX HUNDRED

MILLION IT GOES TO AFFORDABLE

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.663
HOUSING WHICH WOULD DOUBLE TO

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.031
ONE POINT TWO MILLION WOULDN'T

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.766

AMOUNT A TRANSITORY IN

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:42.408
DEVELOPMENT IS AT THE TIME I'M

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:43.909
THINKING ABOUT THE MECHANISM OF

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:46.545
ALL THE REVENUE INCREASE TAX --

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.414
ANY KIND OF REVENUE INCREASE

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.918
EXPANDING THE TOP MAKING THE TAX

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:53.652
CREDIT.

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:54.286
WHICH REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:54.987
AGAIN.

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:55.921
THAT CAN BE DONE IT COULD BE ANY

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:57.122
KIND OF REVENUE LIKE THAT.

00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:00.092
IS A COULD BE MATCHED WITH

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:03.062
FEDERAL -- FEDERAL FUNDS LIKE I

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:06.699
LIKE TO POINT OUT THE I HAVE NOT

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.200
SEEN A PROPOSAL DOING THAT IT

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.369
CAN BE DONE [inaudible]

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:13.272
HOWEVER -- WELL WE DO NEED WHAT

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.240
WE DO KNOW WE NEED IS AN ONGOING

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.576
SOURCE OF REVENUE THAT STUDY ON

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:18.277
GOING.

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:19.945

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:21.847
EASILY USE BY CITIES WHICH TH

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.749
STARS.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:24.817
SO THE THIS.

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:29.822
PROPOSAL DOES NOT REQUIRE -- THE

00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:32.224
TWO THIRDS VOTE THAT DO YOU.

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:33.459

AUCTION WHICH HAS BEEN

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.065
DETERMINED BY THE COURTS TO NOT

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:41.767
BE IFFY AND NOT BE ATTACKS WOULD

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.102
REQUIRE TWO THIRDS BUT I JUST

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:44.203
WANTTO KNOW.

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:46.372
THE MECHANISMS THAT TREE THAT

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:48.374
YOU -- PEOPLE YES AGREE WITH

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:55.114

UNLIMITED REDEVELOPMENT IN THE

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:02.221
CRISIS THAT WE HAD IN THE BUDGET

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.489
I MEAN WE HAD.

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.457
WE HAD A GROUP OF PROGRAMS THAT

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:08.627
ENCOURAGE -- COMMUNITY

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:11.563
INVESTMENTS -- IT RICK IT DID

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.498

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.633
IT HAS SOME FAILINGS.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.771
AND THIS BILL -- WINDSOR REQUIRE

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:20.272

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.274
VARIOUS WAYS WE TRIED.

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:24.376
TO DEVISE A WAY WHERE WE CAN

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:26.078
CORRECT THOSE PROBLEMS.

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:28.547
MAKE CORRECTIONS AND MAKE IT

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:30.682
PHYSICALLY MORE RESPONSIBLE.

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:32.584
AND WE CAME UP WITH THIS BILL.

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:38.857
AND IN MY AREA -- THE LOCAL

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:41.193
GOVERNMENTS HAVE PASSED HOUSING

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.461
MEASURES.

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:43.462
HOWEVER THE STATE NEEDS TO COME

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:46.231
