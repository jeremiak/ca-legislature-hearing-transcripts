00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.846
THE GAME CHANGER AND IF WE HAD

00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:05.783
ENOUGH DOSES TO VACCINATE OUR

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.518
EDUCATORS THAT WOULD BE THE

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:10.254

THEM FOR US- ROBERT S. COLEMAN

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:22.667
NINETEEN TESTING IN CONTACT

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:28.239

DEPARTMENTS FOR WHAT'S CALLED-

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:46.517
THE PANDEMIC EBT WHICH PROVIDES

00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:49.086

PROGRAM. EVEN WITH THAT TESTING

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:45.903
PROGRAM THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:47.771
OUT AND CONTRACTED WITH THE

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.642
TESTING I EVEN WITH THAT

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:53.510
PROGRAM THEY PROJECT THAT ONE

THEIR SCHOOL- HOW ARE PONDERED

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.185
FOR COVERT. BUT A SYMPTOMATIC

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:03.754
IN SO THE REALLY SPEAKS TO THE

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:06.090

CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT. THERE EXT.

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:28.145
BM STAY OPENS THE FALL MINIMAL

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.514
ARE INCREASING GREAT EXCEPTION-

OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:33.751
PLACES LIKE SACRAMENTO COUNTY

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:36.587
WE'VE HEARD STORIES OF. SCHOOLS

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:37.421
OPENING AND THEN HAPPEN TO

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:38.856
CLOSE BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN AN

00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:41.558
INCREASE IN A COVERT TESTING.

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:43.627
THE RESEARCH THAT WE LOOKED AT

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:44.094
THE NATION AND REALLY

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:46.964
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD- SUGGESTS

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.766
THERE AGAIN IT'S THE RESULTS

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:51.101
ARE MIXED SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:54.171
BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN. SMALL OR

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:59.343
MINIMIZE THE SPRING- WHEN

00:42:59.410 --> 00:42:59.977
SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OPENED OTHERS

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:00.611
HAVE NOT. BY MOST ACCOUNTS WHAT

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.046
WE SEE IS OUR BEST EFFORT

00:43:02.112 --> 00:43:04.682
DISTINCT OPEN SCHOOLS IN PERSON

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.216
IN SMALLER GRADES K. THROUGH

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:08.852
SIX. IN THAT. IT RELATES TO

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.287
MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL OTHER

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:11.221
THAT CAN BE HIGHER RATES OF

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:12.723
TRANSMISSION AGAIN AND THIS IS

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:13.924
ALL BASED ON RESEARCH I'M NOT

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:15.759
AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST BUT WE'VE

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:16.927
BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH MANY

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:18.629
OF THEM- IN THIS IS WHAT THE

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.097
RESEARCH HAS TOLD US. IN THIS

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:20.998
IS WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM MANY

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:22.366
PARK DISTRICTS WHEN THEY SAID

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.801
MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THEY WANT

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:25.602
HELP THEY NEED DOLLARS TO GET

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:27.504
ACCESS TO CORRECT I THINK. THEY

00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:29.006
WANT ACCESS TO INFORMATION FROM%

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.841
HEALTH EXPERTS ON WHAT THE

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:32.876
TESTING INTERVAL SHOULD BE AND

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:36.981
HOW TO GO ABOUT TESTING IN.

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:37.614
CONTEXT RACING TO KEEP EVERYONE

JANUARY THIRTY THAT ACTUALLY

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.999
DOES HAVE A TESTING PROGRAM.

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:56.800
THE CADENCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:58.802
YOUR COLOR. RATHER THAN- CASES

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:01.005

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:13.050
LOT OF TESTING IN THERE. IT'S

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:14.418
IN THERE AND AGAIN IT'S

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.420
ASSOCIATED. WITH THE COLOR YOUR

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:17.988
COUNTY MAY BE AN- AND THERE'S

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:20.124

TRANSPARENCY WITH REGARD TO

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.636
COVER CASES. WHICH ARE BOTH

00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:34.538
TALKED IN. TO THE GOVERNOR'S

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:38.308

PROPOSAL IN ADDITION TO THE TWO

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:53.257
BILLION DOLLARS CREATES

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:55.793
REQUIREMENT FOR REPORTING- THAT

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:57.461
DOESN'T CURRENTLY EXIST AND

00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:59.797
IT'S SAD TO SAY THAT IN A STATE

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:00.831
WITH THE THOUSAND SCHOOL

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:01.865
DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALL RUN

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.600
LOCALLY WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:05.469
KIND OF SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW US.

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:07.204

THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SOME

00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:17.581
CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:19.383
DETAILS OF THE RE OPENING

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:20.551
PROPOSAL WE THINK THAT BY AND

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:21.952
LARGE. THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:23.387
COMPONENTS THAT WE HOPE YOU

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:26.924
WILL SUPPORT IS THE TWO BILLION

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:30.227
DOLLAR. PROJECT THANK YOU AT

DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:42.172
ABOUT THIS TWO BILLION PROPOSAL

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:44.341
AND- AND WHETHER IT'S WORKABLE

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.610
OR NOT AND SOME LARGER

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:48.712
DISTRICTS HAVE HAVE OUTLINED.

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:50.114
SOME FLAWS IN THAT DID NEVER BE

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.149
ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT SO DO YOU

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:55.018
HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. THANK

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:56.153
YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE WE'VE

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.521
BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THOSE

00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:59.490
DISTRICTS THAT RAISE CONCERN-

00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:01.391
IN THE CONCERNS HAVE RANGED

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.627
FROM- FEELING THAT THERE'S NOT

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:06.130
ENOUGH FUNDING- WELL YOU KNOW

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:07.331
WHAT WHICH IS LEGITIMATE WHEN

00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:08.765
YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:09.366
STUDENTS AND STAFF THAT WE'RE

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:12.369
TALKING ABOUT- BUT- I DON'T SEE

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:13.704
THAT AS A REASON TO NOT SUPPORT

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:14.771
THE TO THE- BILLION DOLLAR

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.073
INVESTMENT. AND IT'S A GOOD

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.008
START AND IN MANY WAYS. IT'S A

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:20.444
GREAT H. TO MARCH AND WE ARE

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:21.411
STATEREASON I SAY BRIDGE

00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:23.280
TOMORROW JUST BECAUSE WE KNOW

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:24.214
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY

00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:26.583
ESTABLISHED- A HUNDRED DAY

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.552
TIMELINE. TO GET SHOOLS OPEN

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:29.720
HAS TALKED ABOUT THE

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:31.755
POSSIBILITY OF MOVING FROM A

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:35.626
HUNDRED MILLION VACCINATIONS. A

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:37.427
DAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY. NO

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:41.165
MILLION TAX ASIANS. SO WE THANK

00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:42.766
THAT- WHY THEIR CONCERNS THE

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:44.134
DOLLAR AMOUNTS. AND WE THINK

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:45.636
THAT THIS IS A BRING. TO WHEN

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:48.105
I'M TAXING DOSES. ARE TASA.

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:49.106
THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT SOME

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:51.308
HAVE RAISED ABOUT THE TESTING

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.610
INTERVAL- I THINK ALSO TIED.TO

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:56.346
FUNDING. BUT BY MOST ACCOUNTS

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:57.915
TESTING WEEKLY OR EVEN EVERY

00:46:57.981 --> 00:46:59.650
OTHER WEEK. GIVES US THE

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.685
INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT OUR

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:02.920
STUDENTS AND STAFF WILL BE

00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.988
STAY. WHEN THEY RETURN TO

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:06.490
SCHOOL A MESSAGE I BELIEVE THAT

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:07.457
THE CONCERN THAT HAVE BEEN

00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:09.760
RAISED CAN BE ADDRESSED. IN WE

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:11.128
ARE PERSONALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:13.030
CONVERSATION BETWEEN SOME OF

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:13.897
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:15.499
CAMPS OFFICE AND MANY OF YOU.

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:20.871
TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO ADDRESS.

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:21.572
SOME OF THE DETAILS. AND I

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:22.306
THINK WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE

00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:24.374
DAY. OF BUT I THINK THAT THE

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:27.411
PROPOSAL- BY AND LARGE- HAS A

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:29.413
SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO OUR

00:47:29.479 --> 00:47:31.515
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND I THINK

00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:32.683
THAT THE FEEDBACK WE'RE GETTING

00:47:32.749 --> 00:47:34.184
FROM OUR DISTRICTS IS- THEY'RE

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:35.886
HELPING TO SHAPE. AND WE SHOULD

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.754
LISTEN TO THEM TO SHAPING US

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:40.991
THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:41.525
ACTUALLY MEETS THEIR NEEDS

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:45.862
GOING FOR. MR TANG. MR TO

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:48.432
PROTECT A GOOD TO SEE YOU- JUST

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:52.469
THE FULL QUESTION SO- YOUR WITH

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.638
A LETTER FROM THE SEVEN LARGEST

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.340
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE SAYING

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:58.875
THAT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:01.345
WOULDN'T ALLOW THEM TO OPEN DO

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:04.615
YOU HAVE A SENSE OF- GIVE A

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:06.483
SENSE OF WHAT HOW MANY

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.685
DISTRICTS WOULD ACTUALLY BE

00:48:08.752 --> 00:48:11.221
OPEN FOR ME IT WOULD BE A SHAME

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:12.689
TO APPROPRIATE THE TWO BILLION

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:14.524
DOLLARS AND THEN NOT SEE

00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:16.360
CHILDREN GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

00:48:16.426 --> 00:48:18.195
AND THEN WE IN REGARDS TO THE

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:20.130
SEVEN LARGEST DISTRICTS DO A

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:22.899
SENSE OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO-

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:24.301
MOVE THOSE DISTRICTS OR WHAT

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:26.803
WOULD IT TAKE TO ASSIST THOSE

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:30.540
DISTRICTS TO OPEN UP. FIFTY TWO

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:32.442
THE STATE A CERTAIN. AS I UNDER

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:34.244
IT THOSE DISTRICTS HAVE

00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:38.415
INDICATED A DESIRE. FOR MORE

00:48:38.482 --> 00:48:41.385
STATE STANDARDS CAN BE

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:45.822
ARTICULATED. DOWN OPENING NOW I

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.357
SUSPECT THAT THERE'S SOME A BIT

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.826
OF A GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:51.094
DISTRICTS ARE ASKING FOR WHAT

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:52.796
HAS BEEN PROVIDED BECAUSE THE

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:55.332
PROPOSALDOES CREATE SOME

00:48:55.399 --> 00:48:58.435
STANDARDS IT IT TALKS ABOUT

00:48:58.502 --> 00:49:01.672
THAT TESTING INTERVALS THAT

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:05.008
WOULD BE IMPORTANT- TO BE MAY I

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:06.743
STILL THINK THAT THERE'S ROOM

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:07.744
FOR ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION I

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:09.913
BELIEVE THAT MOST DISTRICTS

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.514
WOULD AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.417
FUNDING BUT SOME HAVE SAID.

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.585
THAT THE MONEY WOULDN'T BE

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:17.254
ENOUGH WHERE THEY HAD ISSUES

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:18.689
WITH SOME OF THE TIMELINE

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:20.557
DISTRICTS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:22.859
ABOUT SOME RECENT GUIDANCE THAT

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:23.727
HAS BEEN PUT OUT BY THE

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.195
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:27.264
THAT CHANGES WHAT IT WOULD TAKE

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.498
FOUR DIFFERENT THAT'S NOT OPEN

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:30.100
TO OPEN BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:30.967
FROM THE GOVERNOR AND GOVERNOR

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:34.638
STAFF THAT THEY'RE. WORKING TO

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:36.239
ADJUST THOSE. ASPECTS OF THE-

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:37.341
BECAUSE THEY WANT MORE

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:39.042
IMPORTANTLY WANT WITH ANYONE

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:41.345
SEE OUR SCHOOLS BE OPEN SO.

00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:42.779
ASSEMBLY MEETING I THINK THAT

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:44.648
IT IS POSSIBLE- TO WORK THROUGH

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:46.116
SOME OF THESE CONCERNS I KNOW

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.517
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:49.086
BEEN IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH A

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:50.754
NUMBER OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:53.056
THAT RAISE CONCERN- AND I THINK

00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:53.924
THAT ALTERNATELY THE PROPOSAL

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:55.892
SHOULD BE SUPPORTED- BUT SOME.

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:59.463
REVISIONS GET MADE TO BEST MEET

00:49:59.529 --> 00:49:59.963
THE NEEDS OF THE SCHOOL

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.098
DISTRICTS. THANK YOU MISTER

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:02.666

NOT THIS COMMITTEES BEEN SAYING

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:05.469
FOR. FOR QUITE A WHILE THE FACT

00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:07.003
WE HAD A HEARING ON IN THE

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.272
FALL. WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:10.040
PUBLIC HEALTH AND JUST

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:12.175
REITERATING. HOW CRITICAL THOSE

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:13.910
GUIDELINES WERE IN JUST HEARING

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:16.279
FROM. MANY OF OUR OUR SCHOOLS

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:17.748
ON OUR PERCENT WHEN THE LARGE

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:20.183
SCHOOL DISTRICTS- STATING HOW

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.852
THERE NEED TO BE CLEARER MORE

00:50:21.918 --> 00:50:23.787
SPECIFIC MORE DIRECTIVE AND

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:26.022
GUIDANCE FROM DPH AND- I THINK

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:28.191
WILDER MOST RECENT GUIDANCE WAS

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:30.227
A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION-

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:32.362
IT'S STILL NOT. QUITE ALL THE

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:33.797
WAY THERE ARE SOME I'M GLAD TO

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:34.798
HEAR THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.333
CONTINUES TO BE IN DISCUSSIONS

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.467
WITH THE- WITH THE DISTRICTS

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:40.771

DISTRICTS. CAN CAN KNOW WHAT

00:50:45.942 --> 00:50:46.877
DIRECTION TO FOLLOW I THINK

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:47.978

TESTING IS A THING THAT I THINK

00:52:09.759 --> 00:52:10.994
IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.529

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:40.624
PROGRAM IS EXPENSIVE SO. IT IF

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:41.992
WE HAD THAT RESOURCES TO DO

00:52:42.058 --> 00:52:43.493

THE- INABILITY TO ACCESS

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.540
TESTING IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:58.375
THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO OUR

00:52:58.441 --> 00:53:00.110
SCHOOLS OPENING EVEN GOING BACK

00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:03.113
TO THE FALL. IN IN SO WE'VE

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:04.381
ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT TESTING

00:53:04.447 --> 00:53:06.116
WAS NEEDED UNFORTUNATELY THE

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:11.588
SURGE HAS. SO AS YOU SAY

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:14.824

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:18.028
WAY TO GO OUT THERE ARE A LOT

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:19.496
OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE FOR

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:21.298
THEIR OWN TASK. LARGER

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.999
DISTRICTS HAVE PAID FOR THEIR

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:24.901
OWN CONTRACTS SMALLER DISTRICTS

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:26.136

THE ABILITY TO DO SO THEY NEED

00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:31.174

DISTANCE LEARNING- BUT I HAVE

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:56.092
MANY PUBLIC SCHOOLS ACTUALLY

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:57.026
THAT HAVE OPENED IN THE

00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:59.228
DISTRICT- AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

00:59:59.295 --> 01:00:02.432
DO SO SAFELY AND- AND- THERE'S

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:06.536
BEEN VERY LIMITED. CASES- A

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:07.670
MARKS SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.005
OPEN THEY'VE BEEN OPEN VERY

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:11.040
SUCCESSFULLY EVEN WITHOUT A

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:13.142
ROBUST CADENCE I MEAN I DON'T I

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:14.377
GUESS WE NEED TO DEFINE WHAT

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:17.547
THAT TERM IS- BUT AS ASSEMBLY

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:20.249
MEMBER MCCARTY. STATED THERE IS

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:22.251
TESTING AVAILABLE AND SCHOOLS

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:25.121
ARE TESTING- YOU KNOW IT AS

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:26.723
PART OF THEIR PROGRAM WHAT THEY

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.192
CAN DO AND WHAT'S FEASIBLE- AND

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:30.860
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT YOUR

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:33.496
VERY SUCCESSFULLY THUS FAR- I'M

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.164
REALLY AWARE OF ONLY ONE.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.767
OUTBREAK AT A LOCAL SCHOOL IT

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.235
DID NOT BECOME SOME KIND OF

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.237
LARGE SPREADING EVENT IT WAS

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.039
CONTAINED IN THE AND THEY YOU

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:45.008
KNOW. WERE ABLE TO GET THE KIDS

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.676
BACK INTO SCHOOL WITHOUT

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:49.145
WITHOUT ANY ISSUES SO I THINK

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:51.848
TO SOME EXTENT YOU KNOW THE YES

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:53.316
WE'D HAVE TESTING BUT IT'S GOT

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:54.250
TO BE SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.985
FEASIBLE FOR THE SCHOOL TO BE

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:59.022
ABLE TO DO- I HEAR A LOT OF IF

01:00:59.088 --> 01:00:59.956
IT'S A WEEKLY TESTING

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.791
REQUIREMENT THERE'S MANY

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:02.759
SCHOOLS ARE JUST NOT GOING TO

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:06.562
BE ABLE TO DO THAT- FEASIBLY-

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:07.897
SO I MEAN NOTE I THINK WE JUST

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:08.965
NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT WHAT

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:10.266
HAS BEEN THE EXPERIENCE YOU

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.300
KNOW HOW. HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.002
DO THIS SAFELY ALREADY I THINK

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:15.972
THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY YES- AS

01:01:16.039 --> 01:01:17.740
FAR AS VACCINES AND HAS BEEN

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.242
POINTED OUT THERE IS A

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.343
DISPARITY RIGHT NOW SOME

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.612
SCHOOLS SOME COUNTIES HAVE BEEN

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:24.747
ABLE TO MOVE FOR WITH VACCINES-

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.783
SCHOOL STAFF AND TEACHERS.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:27.717
WHEREAS OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN

01:01:27.784 --> 01:01:29.552
ABLE TO AND JUST TO SHED A

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:30.987
LITTLE BIT MORE LIGHT ON THIS

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:31.587

TO GET. OF OUR PROPOSAL ARE

01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:49.932
FEASIBLE. THERE ARE AT LEAST IN

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.967
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE DOING

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:52.534
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.103

FORTH AN IMPALA SO. I DON'T

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:10.252
NECESSARILY AGREE THAT THAT

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:11.887
IT'S UNLIKELY TO RESULT INQUIRY

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:14.356
OPENING OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:14.923
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.658
CHANGES. ON SOME OF THE DETAILS

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:17.426
OF THE PLAN TO MAKE IT MORE

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:20.062
FEASIBLE- BUT WE BELIEVE THAT

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:22.131
IF BOTH CAN AND WILL RESULT IN

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:24.399
INCREASING FOCUS SAFETY OF IN

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.340
THIS IS THE VACCINES AS I SAID

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:33.709
EARLIER ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:35.344
BASED UPON WHAT WE'RE GETTING

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:36.612
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:37.880
THE MANUFACTURERS BUT ONE

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:39.515
THING. I THINK WE COULD

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.316
ADDRESSES THAT IS THE TESTING.

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.051
AND I'VE HEARD FROM LOCAL AS

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:44.787
WAS MENTIONED EARLIER SCHOOLS

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:45.788
HERE IN SACRAMENTO PRIVATE

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:47.790
SCHOOLS AND HOW MUCH THEY ARE

01:13:47.856 --> 01:13:49.758
SPENDING ON TESTING BUT MONEY

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:51.393
IS NOT THE PROBLEM WE HAVE.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.228
INFUSION OF ONE TIME I IN THIS

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:55.097
BUDGET FOR REVENUES COMING IN

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.565
THE FIRST FEDERAL PACKAGE THE

01:13:56.632 --> 01:14:00.736
SECOND ONE. SO WHAT COULD WE DO

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.304
TO NOT LESSER AND I USED TO

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.706
PROVIDE CASH OR THE PROMISE TO

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:05.974
SCHOOL DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW I

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:07.876
MEAN. LAST YEAR OF THE DIESS WE

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.812
HAVE TO BUY. OR NOT WE HAVE TO

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:11.280

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:16.785
TESTS THAT WE. TAKE THE INSTANT

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:17.653
TEST WHATEVER THERE ARE THINK

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:18.554
THEY'RE THIRTY BUCKS A TE WOULD

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.823
HAVE YOU- BUT- WHY WE HAVE

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:21.990
ENOUGH MONEY IT'S- AND- MORE

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:24.493
COMING IN. TO JUST FRONT AND

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.094
ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:28.664
PURCHASE THESE. IS THAT AT ALL

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:29.998
IN THIS SCENARIO BECAUSE IT

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:31.900
WOULD BE A SHAME. TO GET THE

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.135
FEDERAL MONEY IN A FEW WEEKS

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:35.204

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.396
THE INITIAL REACTION OF MANY

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:37.032

THAT TO BE A SAFETY PROTOCOLS I

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:13.088
THINK THE GUIDANCE THAT WE

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:02.537
WHICH IS THIS. REDEFINITION OF

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:05.073

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.435
CERTAINLY SO I THINK WHAT YOU

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:34.870
WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:36.805
THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:56.124
AND- AND SO THAT'S THE CURRENT

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:57.526
PROPOSAL WE HAVE HEARD FROM A

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:59.494
LOT OF- ELEAZAR ESPECIALLY

MEMBER GALLAGHER AND SO THERE'S

01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:58.747
A COUPLE OF ISSUES AROUND

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:00.148
DIFFER ALSO WON THE FIRST

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:02.284
PIECES- WE HAVE NOT FINALIZED

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:04.286
REVENUES FOR IT BUT THE CURRENT

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:06.021
YEAR AND THE BUDGET YEAR-

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:08.123
THERE'S STILL QUITE A BIT AS- A

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:09.724
FLEXIBILITY IN THE AFFECTED BY

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:11.293
POSSIBLY. THERE COULD STILL BE

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:11.993
QUITE A BIT OF VOLATILITY IN

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.863
THOSE AND WE'RE NOT A 100%

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:15.797
LOCKED DOWN ON WHAT THAT COULD

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:17.632
BE I'M LOOKING FORWARD SO IT

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:18.933
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.236
PROPOSAL AND THAT WE JUST DON'T

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:23.471
KNOW AT WHAT OUR FINAL REVENUES

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:24.906
ARE GOING TO BE. STEP ONE

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.174
PIECES THE UNCERTAINTY THE

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:28.576
SECOND PIECE IS THAT AND FOR

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:31.313
THOSE ELEAZAR WHO HAS- GONE OUT

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:33.548
FOR TRANS WHICH ARE SHORT TERM

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:36.451
CASH LOAN AND THAT THEY OFTEN.

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:38.787
TAKE ON DURING THAT TIME THE

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:42.757
DEFERRAL- IT EAT EARLY PAYOFF

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:45.593
COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES- AND

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.995
OR TAX IMPLICATIONS AT THE

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:48.396
FEDERAL LEVEL AND I WOULD HAVE

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:51.266
TO DEFER FOR SPECIFICS. ON CUE

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.233
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:53.568
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:54.703
MORE INFORMATION AROUND THAT

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:56.838
BUT ESSENTIALLY- ELLIE A IS NOT

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.707
ALLOWED TO TAKE OUT A TREND

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.942
THAT IS BEYOND WHAT- IT'S

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:03.178
ACTUAL NEED IS SO IT COULD

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:04.312
CREATE COMPLICATIONS IN THE

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:06.081
FIELD TO THE EXTENT THAT WE-

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:13.388
TRY TO PAY OFF- DEFERRALS.

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:13.955
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY DEFERRED

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:15.990
THEN. AND SO. THAT'S ANOTHER P.

01:23:16.057 --> 01:23:17.959
AND THEN THE FINAL P. ISSUES

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:19.994
AROUND CASH DEPENDS FOR THIS-

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:21.029
THAT CASH FLOW WITH SOME. THAT

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:21.663
YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:22.597
AND NATURE THAT WE CAN DO IN

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:23.865
OUR SPA. WAY SO THERE ARE OTHER

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:25.900
COMPLICATIONS AROUND THAT AND

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.202
THAT YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT IN

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:28.536
TIME WHERE WE ARE IN THIS WHOLE

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:32.040
PROCESS- IT DOES NOT SEEM WIDE.

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:35.076
TO PAY THOSE OFF EARLY. OKAY

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:36.411
WELL WITH A FIFTEEN BILLION

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.613
DOLLAR WINDFALL AND SIX BILLION

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.514
COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:40.882
GOVERNMENT I THINK WE CAN MAKE

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:43.485
OUR SCHOOLS HOLE ON TO PAYMENTS

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:44.686
I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT I'LL

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:47.122
GO INTO A- YEAH YOU WANT TO

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:48.523
MORE SPECIFICS I THINK WHY THE

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:49.891
L. A. O. IS SAYING THAT YOUR RE

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:51.760
OPENING PLAN AN INCENTIVE GRANT

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:54.596
IS ON WORKABLE. IS BECAUSE OF A

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:55.497
FEW THINGS AND ALL THIS LIST

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:57.665
SOME OF THEM ONE IS YOU HAVE A

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.634
FEBRUARY ONE FILE DATE WE

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.469
HAVEN'T EVEN COMPLETED THIS

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:02.937
EARLY ACTION ITEM SO HOW ARE

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.472
THEY GONNA APPLY FOR MONEY NEXT

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:06.441
WEEK. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO BE

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:10.044
OPEN BY MID. FEBRUARY YOU KNOW

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.246
THE GOVERNOR'S GOT A BLUEPRINT

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:12.280
IN PLACE THAT SAYS IF YOU

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:13.648
DIDN'T REOPEN YOUR SCHOOL IN

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.784
THE FALL YOU CAN'T REOPEN UNTIL

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:17.485
YOU GET OUT OF PURPLE TEAR.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:18.987
UNLIKELY THAT MANY OF THESE

01:24:19.053 --> 01:24:20.622
COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE IN RED

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:22.557
DEER BY THAT TIME HOW ARE THEY

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.826
GOING TO RE OPEN- SO I MEAN

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.161
THAT THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:28.129
KIND OF A MAJOR BLOCKADE-

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:29.864
ANOTHER ONE. IS THE TESTING

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:31.666
CADENCE MANY DISTRICTS AS YOU

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.401
KNOW. I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:34.602
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:36.438
TO DO A WEEKLY TESTING CADENCE

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:37.539
WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:40.275
BE- THE CADENCE REQUIRED TO GET

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:42.677
INCENTIVE GRANT MONIES. ANOTHER

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:45.613
BARRIER. FOR DISTRICTS TO BE

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.247
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.550
MONEY- AND THEN YOU HAVE BEEN

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:51.686
HERE A REQUIREMENT THAT. THE-

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:52.921
TEACHERS LOCAL TEACHERS UNION

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:58.460
HAS TO SUPPORT. OR APPROVE ACT.

01:24:58.526 --> 01:24:59.661
RE OPENING PLANNED FOR THAT

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:01.496
SCHOOL I HAVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:02.430
GETTING CEASE AND DESIST

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:04.566
LETTERS FROM THE DAY AS WE

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:06.835
SPEAK- AND THERE YOU AND

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:07.836
THEY'RE GOING TO USE THIS

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.471
PROVISION ESSENTIALLY TO KEEP

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:11.039
SCHOOL SHUT DOWN SO THERE'S

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:14.742
SOME MAJOR. PROBLEMS WITH YOUR

01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:15.376
RE OPENING PRO AND I JUST GIVE

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.812
YOU A FEW- HOW DO YOU GUYS

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:18.913
INTEND TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.448
OTHERWISE I THINK YOU ARE NOT

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:23.184
GOING TO GET A LOT OF DISTRICTS

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:23.685
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:28.423
INCENTIVE MONEY. CERTAINLY AND

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:30.825
FIX IT TO TACKLE A BUT AT THE

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:32.994
BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS. AND WE

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:34.362
ARE AWARE THAT THEIR CONCERNS

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:35.697
AROUND TIMELINE DETECTING

01:25:35.763 --> 01:25:37.465
CADENCES AND THEN CONCERNED

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:38.900
ABOUT. SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:42.537
OPEN- AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:43.104
TO ENSURE THAT KIDS ARE NOT

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:45.340

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:47.976
OF AND AT STURGEON FACTION. I'M

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:49.043
FOR THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:50.745
ARE DEFINITELY WORKING ON-

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.514
AGAIN YOU KNOW OUR OUR

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.315
ANTICIPATION WITH THAT- YEAH WE

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:58.720
MIGHT HAVE IT AT A FASTER- MOVE

01:25:58.786 --> 01:26:00.288
ON THIS ITEM THAT HAD HAPPENED

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:01.956
AND SO CERTAINLY NEED TO LOOK

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:02.590
AT THAT FEBRUARY ONE DATE AS I

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:04.692
MENTIONED. I'M THE ONE THING I

01:26:04.759 --> 01:26:06.895
DO I DO WANT TO JUST CLARIFY-

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:10.031
ON DECLINING ISSUE IS THAT- THE

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:14.869
LANGUAGE IN THE EVEN IN THE.

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:15.370
CURRENT ITERATION OF THE

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.437
TRAILER BILL. DEFIES THAT

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:19.474
ELEAZAR ARE- YOU KNOW ABOUT

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:21.776
TWENTY. TO EIGHT AND- IT'S IT

WILL BE CHANGED FIVE. ABOUT THE

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.647
I. TWENTY FIVE HER HUNTER

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:27.348
THOUSAND- THAT AD THEY DON'T

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:29.851
HAVE TO RE OPEN- BY THE DATE

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:31.319
SPECIFIED THEY ONLY HAVE TO

01:26:31.386 --> 01:26:32.620
REOPEN LINDA THANK YOU DO YOU

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:33.988
FELT WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE-

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:35.456
THERE COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:37.125
RATES DROP. I JUST WANNA MAKE

01:26:37.191 --> 01:26:38.560
SURE THAT WAS CLEAR THAT WE'RE

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:40.962
NOT HOLDING ANYONE WHO IS- IN A

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.231
DEEP. PURPLE CONTUSION PEOPLE

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:44.499
ARE CALLING IT COULD REALLY.

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:47.769
AND TO REOPEN BEFORE IT IS SAFE

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:51.039
TO DO. WE HAVE MANY SCHOOL

01:26:51.105 --> 01:26:52.373
DISTRICTS THAT ARE OPEN RIGHT

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.042
NOW IN PURPLE TEAR- THEY

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:55.476
ALREADY RE OPEN IN THE FALL AND

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:57.812
THEY STAYED OPEN AND THEY ARE

01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:01.215
NOT HAVING PROBLEMS SO. I GUESS

01:27:01.282 --> 01:27:02.417
I UNDERSTAND THAT I MEAN SHOULD

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:03.151
THERE BE A CHANGE TO THE

01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:04.953
BLUEPRINT. FRAMEWORK I MEAN THE

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:06.754
GOVERNOR CHANGES PLANNED

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:09.057
OVERNIGHT LAST NIGHT- I'M

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:10.124
SUPPOSING YOU COULD PROBABLY

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:12.193
CHANGE THE BLUEPRINT TODAY TOO

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:17.865
IF YOU WANTED TO. I'M NOT SURE

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:19.500
WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS A

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:20.468
DEFINITE CHANGE IN THE FINE

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:21.970
OVERNIGHT LAST NIGHT HOWEVER

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:25.907
AND- I WOULD MENTION THAT MORE-

01:27:25.974 --> 01:27:27.241
THE REGIONAL STAY AT HOME WATER

01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:30.211
THAT HE LIFTED. NOT CONSISTENT

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:32.213
WITH HIS PREVIOUS CRITERIA AND

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.948
NONE OF US WERE TOLD ABOUT

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:37.885
AHEAD OF TIME THAT CHANGE.

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:39.253
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T I CAN'T

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.221
THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:42.323
MY AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT- WHAT

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:44.192
I CAN SAY IS THAT AS I

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:46.194
MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.895
LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.397
ENSURE THAT. ON SCHOOL

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.999
DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY OPEN

01:27:51.065 --> 01:27:52.934
AND THAT HAVE NOT HAD SEARCHES

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:54.902
OR OUTBREAKS OF INFECTION I'M

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:56.237
CAN ALSO BENEFIT FROM THIS

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:57.572
PROGRAM IS FILE AND NOT HAVE TO

01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:59.474
BE CLOSED SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:02.110
WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW I'M

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.011
TRYING TO FIND SOME SOLUTIONS

01:28:03.077 --> 01:28:10.351
FOR. OKAY. SAID MR GALLAGHER

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:12.453
YES I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT I

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.789
FULLY SUPPORT THE FIRST THING

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:16.791
THAT MR GALLAGHER BROUGHT UP AS

01:28:16.858 --> 01:28:19.827
FAR AS THE DEFERRALS FOR K.

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:20.828
TWELVE AND FOR COMMUNITY

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:23.531
COLLEGES- NOT TO MENTION THAT

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:24.832
WE'RE ANTICIPATING GETTING MORE

01:28:24.899 --> 01:28:27.035
MONEY IN MAY FROM INCREASE

01:28:27.101 --> 01:28:29.070
REVENUES JUST FROM THE ECONOMY

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:31.439
ARE TAX RECEIPTS PLUS WE HAVE

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:33.841
THIS INFUSION OF FEDERAL MONEY

01:28:33.908 --> 01:28:34.409
COMING UPGRADE IT'S ONLY ONE

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:36.077
TIME BUT- WE'RE- LOOKING AT

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:38.046
POTENTIALLY. THIRTEEN BILLION

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:39.714
ON TOP OF THE SIX WE ALREADY

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:42.083
GOT SO. I THINK THAT WE OWE IT

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:44.619
TO OUR SCHOOLS- TO MAKE THEM

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.254
HOLD ITS IS SMART BUDGETARY

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.589
PRACTICE SO I WITH THAT NEXT WE

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.491
HAVE SOME MEMBER OF DONALD ON

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:52.160

WE'VE BEEN ABOUT THIS SEEM.

01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:52.946
BASED ON THE THEME IN THIS THAT

I'VE HAD WITH AND IT'S OF LIKE.

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:56.850
MONEY BEEN THAT MAIN HURDLE

01:40:56.917 --> 01:41:00.921

CLEAR GUIDANCE AND CLEAR

01:41:01.488 --> 01:41:04.558
DIRECTION. YEAH I CERTAINLY

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:05.492
CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:06.693
OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY WILL SAY

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.961
THAT THE GUIDANCE THAT DATE

01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:09.363
THEY PUT OUT I KNOW IT FEELS

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:10.697
LIKE THEY'RE CONSTANTLY KIND

01:41:10.764 --> 01:41:12.633
BEING RELEASED BUT- REALLY THE

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:13.367
ONLY APPEALING TO PEOPLE TO

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:15.102
KIND OF PUT OUT HAVE BEEN IN

01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.969
AUGUST AND IN THE THREE POINT

01:41:16.036 --> 01:41:17.905
LINE AND- THEY WORK REALLY HARD

01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:19.273
TO ENSURE THAT. WHAT THEY DO

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:20.641
PUT OUT IS BASED ON THE BEST

01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:21.708
SCIENCE THAT THEY HAVE AT THE

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:23.243
TIME BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE

01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:24.278
DEFINITELY GET KIDS BACK INT

01:41:24.344 --> 01:41:25.279
SCHOOL THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:41:25.345 --> 01:41:26.413
THAT IT'S DONE SAFELY IN

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.748
DOESN'T EXACERBATE THE CURRENT

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:28.649
SITUATION WHICH WE FIND

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:31.151
OURSELVES. I'M HOWEVER I THINK

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:32.920
THAT WHERE THE INTERSECTION OF

01:41:32.986 --> 01:41:34.488
THE GUIDANCE AND THE GRANT ARE

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:35.823
CONCERNED I THINK THAT'S

01:41:35.889 --> 01:41:37.491
DEFINITELY AN AREA WHERE. WE'RE

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:38.926

PARTICIPATE IN THE GRANT AS IT

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:44.565
CONNECTS TO THE GUIDANCE SO. I

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:45.532
THINK THAT I THINK THAT'S A

01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:49.503
REALLY KEY AREA. AND THAT'S

01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:50.137
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:51.505

WE WOULD CONCUR AS WELL AS A

01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:54.174
NEW. I DON'T THINK YOU WERE AT

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:56.043
OUR HEARING AND I THINK IT WAS.

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:59.046
OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER- THAT WE

01:41:59.112 --> 01:42:00.514

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:28.242
DIVERSE CITY AND SITUATIONS

DISTRICTS ARE- ARE IN A PLACE

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.015
WHERE THEIR INFECTION RATES ARE

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:37.518
SO HIGH- THAT IT'S UNLIKELY

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:38.752

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:48.962
INCREDIBLY HIGH THAT. THAT

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:50.397
THEY'RE PLANNING FOR WHEN WE

01:42:50.464 --> 01:42:52.432
OPENING AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:53.901
THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT OUR

01:42:53.967 --> 01:42:56.503
PROPOSAL WILL ENCOURAGE- AT

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:57.471
LEAST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:58.805
HAVE THE PLANS IN PLACE AND I

01:42:58.872 --> 01:43:00.040
THINK THAT'S A REALLY CRUCIAL

01:43:00.107 --> 01:43:01.475
POINT THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:02.242
IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN OPEN

01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:03.844
RIGHT NOW. THAT YOU ARE READY

01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:05.245
TO GO WHEN YOUR INFECTION RATES

01:43:05.312 --> 01:43:06.413
DROPPED LOW ENOUGH TO MAKE IT

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.149
SAFE- BECAUSE I THINK BUT ONE

01:43:09.216 --> 01:43:10.784
OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IS

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:12.286
THAT. WE'RE NOT CAUGHT FLAT

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:14.655
FOOTED- AS AS YOU WELL KNOW AND

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:15.822
AS I MENTIONED IN THE LAST

01:43:15.889 --> 01:43:17.124
HEARING YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:18.825
THOUGHT BACK AT LAST MARCH

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:20.427
THAT. WILL CLOSURES WERE GONNA

01:43:20.494 --> 01:43:21.795
LAST YOU FOR A EW WEEKS AND

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:23.163
THEN WE GO BACK IN AND THEN

01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:25.032
THEY CAN CHANGES PRESS ON AND

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:26.233
THEN YOU KNOW WE- FINISH THE

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:27.200
SCHOOL YEAR AND DISTANCE

01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:28.735
LEARNING AND YOU KNOW IT IS

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:30.003
DONE SO ON AND SO FORTH AND SO

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:31.638
I THINK OUR- ONE OF OUR MAIN

01:43:31.705 --> 01:43:33.607
HE'S- AND GOLD WITH THIS GRANT.

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:35.075
IS NOT ONLY TO GET AS MANY

01:43:35.142 --> 01:43:36.476
PEOPLE BACK IN PERSON AS WE

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:38.378
CAN. I'M IN A SAFE MANNER WHERE

01:43:38.445 --> 01:43:39.913
IT IS SAFE TO DO SO BUT ALSO TO

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.748
MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE ELEAZAR

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:44.618
THAT ARE. IN HIGH TRANSMISSION

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:46.486
AREAS ARE READY TO GO AS SOON

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:47.821
AS A DISTINCT IDENTITY THEFT.

01:43:47.888 --> 01:43:49.756
THE HOME SOME WITH ALL DUE

01:43:49.823 --> 01:43:56.330

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:58.298
IN THE JULY BUDGET. WE GAVE

01:43:58.365 --> 01:44:00.467
ELEAZAR FIVE BILL. DOLLARS ON.

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:02.002
I THINK WE'LL ALL. OF PAST OUT

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:04.972
BUDGET. IN IN THE SUMMER THIS

01:44:05.038 --> 01:44:06.607
OPTION WAS EXACTLY WHAT YOU

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:08.241
SAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:09.977
READY THEY WERE GONNA DO THEIR

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:11.712
TAKE A SUMMER WE GAVE THEM FIVE

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:12.479
BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:15.482
RESOURCES. TO GET READY TO OPEN

01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:17.284
IN THE FALL AND WHAT WE SAW IS.

01:44:17.351 --> 01:44:21.121
ON HOW DO YOU KNOW AUGUST HIT.

01:44:21.188 --> 01:44:23.023
AND TRANSMISSION LEVELS WERE

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.858
WERE LOW MUCH MUCH LOWER THAN

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:28.328
THEY ARE TODAY. AND YET- YOU

01:44:28.395 --> 01:44:29.262
KNOW I WOULD I WOULD DISAGREE

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:30.797
DO YOU ARE YOU MAKE YOU

01:44:30.864 --> 01:44:32.399

KNOW ELLIE IS ALL OVER THE

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:34.735
PLACE ACTUALLY- HE'S ACTING

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:36.069
VERY CONSISTENTLY I THINK OVER

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:38.105
90% OF THEM ARE CLOSED. SO THAT

01:44:38.171 --> 01:44:39.640
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:40.974
SITUATION MAY BE DIFFERENT.

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:42.876
THEIR BEHAVIOR IS VERY

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:44.544
CONSISTENT JUST LIKE A YEAR AGO

01:44:44.611 --> 01:44:45.712
THEY WERE ALL PRETTY CONSISTENT

01:44:45.779 --> 01:44:49.282
THEY WERE ALL OPEN. SO AGAIN

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:53.453
THERE IS. YOU KNOW WE- I DON'T

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.822
WANT TO REPEAT WHAT WE DID IN.

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:56.456
IN JUNE WHEN WE PASSED A

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:59.493
BUDGET. GAVE SCHOOLS WHAT WE

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:01.128
BELIEVED WERE ADEQUATE

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:03.430
RESOURCES WHAT WE SAW IS. NOT

01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:05.232
NOT ONLY DID THIS DISTRICTS NOT

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:06.967
UTILIZE THOSE RESOURCES IN THE

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:08.935
SUMMER. THEY DIDN'T EVEN REALLY

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:10.404
UTILIZE THE RESOURCES UNTIL THE

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:12.506
FALL YOU DIDN'T EVEN SEE. MOST

01:45:12.572 --> 01:45:14.141
RESOURCES BEING PULLED DOWN

01:45:14.207 --> 01:45:15.275
UNTIL DECEMBER WHEN THE

01:45:15.342 --> 01:45:19.813
DEADLINE WAS COMING. IN SO- YOU

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:22.616
KNOW I WANT TO WORK WITH THE

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:24.484
ADMINISTRATION. WE ALL HAVE THE

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:25.752
SAME GOALS WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:28.989
HAVE SCHOOLS. BE REOPENED IN

01:45:29.056 --> 01:45:31.625
THE SAFEST MANNER. PASSABLE

01:45:31.692 --> 01:45:36.463
pTO REPEAT THE SAME. MISTAKE

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:38.398
THAT WE'VE MADE IN THIS LAST

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:41.468
BUDGET WERE BECAME DISTRICTS-

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:43.870
RESOURCES TO OPEN UP AND WE DID

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:48.642
NOT. SEE THAT HAPPEN. IS SO-

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:50.744
YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU YOU

01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:52.045
FEEL THAT THE TWO BILLION

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:53.647
DOLLARS COULD BE SPENT TO

01:45:53.714 --> 01:45:56.450
PREPARE. DISTRICTS TO OPEN UP

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:58.885
WHICH WOULD. DID YOU MEAN TO

01:45:58.952 --> 01:46:00.420
PREPARE THEM TO OPEN UP THIS

01:46:00.487 --> 01:46:01.354
YEAR OR YOU'RE TALKING IN THE

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:02.756
FALL BECAUSE IF WE'RE TALKING

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:03.824
IN THE FALL I DON'T I DON'T

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:05.325
THINK WE NEED TO DO IN THE-

01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:07.661
EARLY ACTION WE CAN JUST TAKE

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:11.832
ACTION IN. IN JUNE. SO THAT'S A

01:46:11.898 --> 01:46:14.801
GREAT POINT AND ATKINS. YEAH SO

01:46:14.868 --> 01:46:16.203
THE DIFFERENCE I THINK ONE OF

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.237
THE BIG ONE THE MAIN

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:18.171
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT WE DID

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:20.240
IN THIS IN THE SUMMER AND IN

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:21.541

TO ALL L. YATES REGARDLESS- OF-

01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:36.289
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE

PLANNING ON OPENING FOR IN

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:38.959
PERSON INSTRUCTION AND WE

01:46:39.025 --> 01:46:41.261
DIDN'T REQUIRE THEM TO OPEN FOR

01:46:41.328 --> 01:46:42.295
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION OR TO

01:46:42.362 --> 01:46:43.997
RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS. WE ALSO

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:44.798
TOLD THEM THEY COULD BE USED

01:46:44.865 --> 01:46:47.033
FOR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION-

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:48.969
DEFENDER VERY TARGETED TO IN

01:46:49.035 --> 01:46:50.704

CURRENTLY CRAFTING IT WE HAVE

01:49:31.998 --> 01:49:33.466

MOST OF THESE ISSUES AND IT

01:49:44.844 --> 01:49:45.879
SOUNDS LIKE DISCUSSIONS ARE

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:47.047
UNDER WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF

01:49:47.113 --> 01:49:48.648

AGAIN NEXT MONDAY. DISTRICTS

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.761

LABOR UNIONS. SECONDLY WE ARE

01:50:08.335 --> 01:50:09.602
ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:11.037
CAPACITY OF THE STATE AGENCIES

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:12.505

PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.188
STRUCTURED IS UNLIKELY TO BE TO

EARLIER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION.

01:50:29.956 --> 01:50:31.825
AND AGAIN ON THEIR TWO REASONS

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:33.760
FOR THIS. FIRST THE ROUTINE

01:50:33.827 --> 01:50:35.595
THERE ARE. FOR ROUTINE A

01:50:35.662 --> 01:50:37.330

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:50.843
TO THAT. AND ANOTHER TWO POINT

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:52.244
THREE BILLION IS PAID ON TOP OF

02:00:52.311 --> 02:00:54.046
THAT BECAUSE OF THE PROPOSITION

02:00:54.113 --> 02:00:55.514
NINETY EIGHT- SUPPLEMENTAL

02:00:55.581 --> 02:00:59.752
PAYMENTS. THE GOVERNOR DR

02:00:59.819 --> 02:01:00.920
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED

02:01:00.987 --> 02:01:02.088
AT THE THREE BILLION DEPOSITS

02:01:02.154 --> 02:01:03.422
IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:01:03.489 --> 02:01:05.057
RESERVE AND THE FACT THAT THAT

02:01:05.124 --> 02:01:06.492
FIGURES FOR THE FIRST TIME A

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:07.426
CAP ON SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:01:07.493 --> 02:01:09.996
RESERVES- THAT CAP IS EQUAL

02:01:10.062 --> 02:01:11.897
210% OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S

02:01:11.964 --> 02:01:13.366
ANNUAL EXPENDITURES. MOST

02:01:13.432 --> 02:01:14.667
DISTRICTS ARE EXEMPT FROM THAT

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:16.435
CAMP CAP AUTOMATICALLY IF A

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:17.937
DISTRICT HAS TWENTY FIVE

02:01:18.004 --> 02:01:19.271
HUNDRED OR FEWER STUDENTS IT'S

02:01:19.338 --> 02:01:21.807
NOT SUBJECT TO THAT CAP- BASED

02:01:21.874 --> 02:01:23.643
ON THE LATEST DATA THAT WE HAVE

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:24.777
A WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT A

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:25.911
HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEDIUM LARGE

02:01:25.978 --> 02:01:28.180
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I CURRENTLY

02:01:28.247 --> 02:01:30.049
MAINTAIN RESERVES ABOVE 10% OF

02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:32.351
THEIR EXPENDITURES. I DISTRICTS

02:01:32.418 --> 02:01:34.153
COULD RESPOND TO THAT CAP IN A

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:35.821
VARIETY OF WAYS THEY COULD BE

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:38.624
CLASSIFIED THEIR RESERVES- TO

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:39.925
AVOID THE CAP THEY COULD ALSO

02:01:39.992 --> 02:01:41.327
ASK THE COUNTY OFFICES OF

02:01:41.394 --> 02:01:42.128
EDUCATION TO APPROVE AN

02:01:42.194 --> 02:01:43.929
EXEMPTION. WE THINK ONE OR TWO

02:01:43.996 --> 02:01:45.331
OF THOSE APPROACHES ARE THE

02:01:45.398 --> 02:01:46.298
MOST LIKELY WAY THAT DISTRICTS

02:01:46.365 --> 02:01:48.200
WOULD RESPOND TO IT- BUT

02:01:48.267 --> 02:01:49.068
ALTERNATIVELY THEY COULD ALSO

02:01:49.135 --> 02:01:52.371
RESPOND BY SPENDING DOWN THOSE

02:01:52.438 --> 02:01:54.440
RESERVES- INTERIM. OF THE

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:56.575
GUARANTEE WE THINK THE AT AT

02:01:56.642 --> 02:01:57.276
THE MOMENTA FINANCES PUT

02:01:57.343 --> 02:01:58.678
FORWARD A GOOD STARTING POINT

02:01:58.744 --> 02:02:00.012
FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. OTHER

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:01.514
ESTIMATES ARE VERY CLOSE TO OUR

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.382
IS BOTH IN TERMS OF GENERAL

02:02:03.449 --> 02:02:04.817
FUND REVENUE AND LOCAL PROPERTY

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:07.687
TAX REVENUE. OVER THE THREE

02:02:07.753 --> 02:02:10.122
YEAR BUDGET PERIOD

02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:11.390
1-922-000-1920 THREE TWENTY ONE

02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:12.925
TWENTY TWO- THEIR ESTIMATES ARE

02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:14.293
JUST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ABOVE

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:17.730
OURS OVER THAT PERIOD SO

02:02:17.797 --> 02:02:18.297
REALLY- VERY CLOSE STARTING

02:02:18.364 --> 02:02:21.367
POINT- THE PROPOSITION NINETY

02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:22.468
EIGHT GUARANTEE WOULD CHANGE

02:02:22.535 --> 02:02:24.136
ABOUT. FORTY SOMETHING A DOLLAR

02:02:24.203 --> 02:02:25.438
FOR EACH DOLLAR OF HIGHER LOWER

02:02:25.504 --> 02:02:27.106
STATE REVENUE. AND GIVEN THE

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:28.407
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY THE

02:02:28.474 --> 02:02:30.943
STATE CASES RIGHT NOW WE THINK

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:32.511
SOME CHANGES ARE LIKELY BY MAY-

02:02:32.578 --> 02:02:33.913
BUT SURPRISINGLY THOSE CHANGES

02:02:33.979 --> 02:02:35.247
MIGHT NOT MEAN MORE OR LESS

02:02:35.314 --> 02:02:36.849
FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL

02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:38.951
PROGRAMS. I TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:39.985
THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:02:40.052 --> 02:02:41.721
GUARANTEE IS HIGHER THE STATE

02:02:41.787 --> 02:02:42.955
WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO DEPOSIT A

02:02:43.022 --> 02:02:44.390
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT

02:02:44.457 --> 02:02:45.491
INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:47.059
EIGHT RESERVE. AND TO THE

02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:48.461
EXTENT THAT THE GUARANTEE IS

02:02:48.527 --> 02:02:51.330
LOWER THE STATE WOULD PROBABLY

02:02:51.397 --> 02:02:53.132
NEED TO MAKE A SMALLER DEPOSIT.

02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:53.866
YOU HEARD THAT THE

02:02:53.933 --> 02:02:54.900
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO REVISIT

02:02:54.967 --> 02:02:56.702
THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. AND

02:02:56.769 --> 02:02:57.837
WE THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE

02:02:57.903 --> 02:02:59.405
IDEA- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

02:02:59.472 --> 02:03:00.773
BUDGET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.308
HAS RECOVERED THE GROUND THAT

02:03:02.374 --> 02:03:03.876
THE STATE WAS EXPECTING IT TO

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:06.145
LOSE BACK IN JUNE- BARRING

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:07.480
ANOTHER RECESSION A MINIMUM

02:03:07.546 --> 02:03:08.814
GUARANTEE LOOKS LIKE WOULD BE

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:11.350
ABLE TO SUPPORT- BOTH THE COST

02:03:11.417 --> 02:03:12.685
OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AS WELL AS

02:03:12.752 --> 02:03:14.286
OTHER AUGMENTATIONS OVER THE

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:16.188
NEXT COUPLE YEARS. ANOTHER

02:03:16.255 --> 02:03:18.557
CONSIDERATION WHICH IS AN ISSUE

02:03:18.624 --> 02:03:19.425
FOR THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE

02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:21.393
AS WELL. THAT THE STATE STATE

02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:23.362
IS FACING A GROWING OPERATING

02:03:23.429 --> 02:03:25.231
DEFICIT ON THE NON PROPOSITION

02:03:25.297 --> 02:03:25.765
NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:28.033
BUDGET- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:28.601
TO MODIFY THE SUPPLEMENTAL

02:03:28.667 --> 02:03:30.236
PAYMENTS DOESN'T ELIMINATE THAT

02:03:30.302 --> 02:03:31.971
OPERATING DEFICIT. BUT IT DOES

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:34.273
MAKE IT A LITTLE AT LEAST A

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:37.810
LITTLE BIT EASIER TO DEAL WITH.

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:39.345
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A GOOD

02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:40.212
OVERVIEW OKAY ALREADY OF THE

02:03:40.279 --> 02:03:41.447
SPECIFIC SPENDING PROPOSALS IN

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:43.282
THIS BUDGET AGAIN THAT'S

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:44.183
NINETEEN NINETEEN POINT ONE

02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:46.919
BILLION- A NEW PROPOSALS. BUT

02:03:46.986 --> 02:03:47.920
SIXTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION FOR

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:49.688
ONE TIME ACTIVITIES TWO POINT

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:52.591
SIX BILLION ONGOING- I'LL ADD

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.627
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL. ON

02:03:54.693 --> 02:03:56.462
ONE AREA THAT'S IN YOUR GENDER.

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:58.230
WHICH IS PENSIONS- SCHOOLS AND

02:03:58.297 --> 02:03:59.565
COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOTH HAVE

02:03:59.632 --> 02:04:03.202
EXPERIENCED LARGE. INCREASES IN

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:03.769
PENSION COSTS OVER THE PAST

02:04:03.836 --> 02:04:06.005
COUPLE YEARS- THE JUNE TWENTY

02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:07.239
TWENTY BUDGET PLAN PROVIDED TWO

02:04:07.306 --> 02:04:08.874
POINT THREE BILLION FOR A ONE

02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:10.676
TIME COST RELIEF. I SPREAD

02:04:10.743 --> 02:04:12.611
ABOUT EVENLY OVER TWENTY TWENTY

02:04:12.678 --> 02:04:14.480
ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

02:04:14.547 --> 02:04:15.381
THE STATE ESSENTIALLY BOUHT

02:04:15.447 --> 02:04:17.216
DOWN COSTA DISTRICTS WOULD

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:18.684
OTHERWISE HAVE PAID OUT OF THE

02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:20.586
LOCAL OPERATING BUDGETS. EVEN

02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:21.887
WITH THAT RELEASE KIND OF

02:04:21.954 --> 02:04:23.556
LOOKING AHEAD TO TWENTY ONE

02:04:23.622 --> 02:04:24.156
TWENTY TWO DISTRICTS ARE STILL

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:26.058
LOOKING AT COST INCREASES AT

02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:28.427
LEAST A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:29.028
POTENTIALLY AS LARGE AS HALF A

02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:31.096
BILLION. BUT A MUCH LARGER

02:04:31.163 --> 02:04:33.966
INCREASE- LOOKS LIKELY FOR

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:35.067
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE-

02:04:35.134 --> 02:04:36.936
CURRENT PROJECTIONS ARE THAT.

02:04:37.002 --> 02:04:38.337
AS THAT ONE TIME RELEASED

02:04:38.404 --> 02:04:40.172
EXPIRES IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:40.706
THREE DISTRICTS MIGHT BE

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:42.808
LOOKING AT AN INCREASE. OF

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:43.375
AROUND ONE POINT SIX BILLION

02:04:43.442 --> 02:04:47.680
DOLLARS. TURNING TO SOME OF OUR

02:04:47.746 --> 02:04:49.882
COMMENTS I THINK ONE KEY ASPECT

02:04:49.949 --> 02:04:51.150
OF THE OF THIS YEAR'S UDGET IS

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:52.218
THAT IT CONTAINS A LARGE ONE

02:04:52.284 --> 02:04:54.453
TIME QUESTION. OF THE FUNDING

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:57.189
THAT SPECIFICALLY ATTRIBUTABLE

02:04:57.256 --> 02:04:57.723
TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO A

02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:58.691
LITTLE OVER FIVE BILLION

02:04:58.757 --> 02:05:00.492
HISTORY ONE TIME ACTIVITIES AND

02:05:00.559 --> 02:05:01.293
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:03.062
THIS BUDGET BECAUSE THAT HELPS

02:05:03.128 --> 02:05:04.797
QUESTION THE BUDGET AGAINST

02:05:04.864 --> 02:05:05.231
SOME OF THE ECONOMIC

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:06.999
UNCERTAINTIES- THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:05:07.066 --> 02:05:08.367
TALKING ABOUT. I REDUCING THE

02:05:08.434 --> 02:05:10.336
LIKELIHOOD OF CUTS TO ONGOING

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:12.571
PROGRAM IS- IF REVENUE DOESN'T

02:05:12.638 --> 02:05:13.839
COME IN AS STRONG AS WE EXPECT

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:16.308
EITHER BY NAY OR POTENTIALLY A

02:05:16.375 --> 02:05:18.744
YEAR FROM NOW. ON THE ECONOMIC

02:05:18.811 --> 02:05:20.079
SUPPORT PROPOSAL I WON'T GO

02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:21.013
INTO THAT TOO MUCH YOU'VE

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:21.914
ALREADY TALKED TO QUITE A BIT

02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:24.917
ABOUT THAT- WE WOULD SUGGEST

02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:26.252
THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING A

02:05:26.318 --> 02:05:27.186
LITTLE BIT SMALLER AND MORE

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:29.121
TARGETED IN THE FOUR POINT SIX

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:30.122
BILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT

02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:32.925
FORWARD- AS- AS THE CHAIR AND

02:05:32.992 --> 02:05:33.926
OTHER MEMBERS MENTIONED ARE.

02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:36.061
ALREADY DISTRICTS RECEIVED MORE

02:05:36.128 --> 02:05:37.329
THAN SEVEN BILLION AND ONE TIME

02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:39.732
FLEXIBLE FUNDS IN TWENTY TWENTY

02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:41.800
ONE- THE LATEST. FEDERAL ACTION

02:05:41.867 --> 02:05:43.269
DECEMBER IT WILL PROVIDE

02:05:43.335 --> 02:05:44.837
ROUGHLY ANOTHER SIX BILLION

02:05:44.904 --> 02:05:46.805
ANYONE TWENTY TWO. AND SO

02:05:46.872 --> 02:05:49.174
RATHER THAN A THIRD ROUND OF A

02:05:49.241 --> 02:05:50.075
BROAD PROBABLY FLEXIBLE

02:05:50.142 --> 02:05:51.710
FUNDING. WE THINK YOU COULD

02:05:51.777 --> 02:05:52.678
MAKE PROVIDE A SMALLER

02:05:52.745 --> 02:05:53.913
AUGMENTATION AND MAYBE MAKE

02:05:53.979 --> 02:05:55.214
SOME MORE PROGRESS AND SOME OF

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.048
THE KEY PRIORITIES THAT YOU'VE

02:05:56.115 --> 02:05:58.350
ARTICULATED. AROUND WE OPENING

02:05:58.417 --> 02:06:01.987
AND MAKING UP FOR FUNDING LOS.

02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:03.255
UP WE ALSO THINK YOU COULD

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:06.125
CONSIDER. A FUNDING A FEW LESS-

02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:07.626
IF YOU'RE A NEW INITIATIVES-

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:09.962
THIS BUDGET HAS AROUND A DOZEN-

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:11.330
NEW PROPOSALS ACROSS CHOOLS

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:13.265
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AROUND

02:06:13.332 --> 02:06:16.769
HALF I ONE TIME AFTER I'M GOING.

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:17.770
AND WE DO THINK SOME OF THOSE

02:06:17.836 --> 02:06:19.471
PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE MOVING

02:06:19.538 --> 02:06:21.407
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT

02:06:21.473 --> 02:06:23.809
THIS IS A LOT TO PUT FORWARD-

02:06:23.876 --> 02:06:24.843
IN THE MID IN THE MIDST OF A

02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:27.313
PANDEMIC RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SOME

02:06:27.379 --> 02:06:28.147
CONCERNS THAT SO MANY NEW

02:06:28.213 --> 02:06:30.683
PROPOSALS- WITH THAT LARGE

02:06:30.749 --> 02:06:32.351
NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THE THEIR

02:06:32.418 --> 02:06:33.419
INDIVIDUAL IMPACT MIGHT BE

02:06:33.485 --> 02:06:35.387
DILUTED A LITTLE BIT. AND IT

02:06:35.454 --> 02:06:36.755
COULD SHIFT ATTENTION AWAY FROM

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:39.692
SOME OF THE CORE PROGRAMS AND

02:06:39.758 --> 02:06:40.292
PRIORITIES THAT YOU'VE TALKED

02:06:40.359 --> 02:06:42.127
ABOUT EARLIER. AND THEN LASTLY

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:43.963
WE RECOMMEND- ALLOCATING MORE

02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:46.932
FUNDING FOR BOTH PAYING DOWN

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:47.566
DEFERRALS AND ADJUSTING PENSION

02:06:47.633 --> 02:06:49.568
COSTS. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:50.903
BUDGET A LITTLE OVER FOUR

02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:52.104
BILLION WOULD REMAIN DEFERRED

02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:52.972
AT THE END OF TWENTY ONE TWENTY

02:06:53.038 --> 02:06:54.440
TWO. WE THINK YOU COULD MAKE

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:56.141
MORE PROGRESS ON THAT THAT

02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:57.810
WOULD GET THE PROPOSITION

02:06:57.876 --> 02:06:58.410
NINETY EIGHT BUDGET BACK IN

02:06:58.477 --> 02:07:01.146
BALANCE. I RELY ON GOING-

02:07:01.213 --> 02:07:02.748
PROGRAM COSTS WITH THE FUNDING

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:05.351
THAT'S AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:05.918
THOSE PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT

02:07:05.985 --> 02:07:07.453
MAKES SENSE- WE ALSO THANK YOU

02:07:07.519 --> 02:07:09.421
COULD- SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING

02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:10.589
NOW TO DEAL WITH THE LARGE

02:07:10.656 --> 02:07:13.058
PENSION COST INCREASES THAT'S-

02:07:13.125 --> 02:07:14.460
LIES AHEAD IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

02:07:14.526 --> 02:07:15.961
THREE. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SET

02:07:16.028 --> 02:07:17.529
ASIDE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION YOU

02:07:17.596 --> 02:07:19.398
COULD PROVIDE A MUCH SMOOTHER-

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:23.669
STEP UP FROM. TWENTY ONE TWENTY

02:07:23.736 --> 02:07:24.269
TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO

02:07:24.336 --> 02:07:24.903
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. WOULD

02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:26.238
MAKE THOSE COSTS MUCH EASIER

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:28.107
FOR DISTRICTS TO DEAL WITH- D.

02:07:28.173 --> 02:07:29.942
SOME LOCAL BUDGET PRESSURE. AND

02:07:30.009 --> 02:07:31.310
POTENTIALLY MAKE A DISTRICT

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:32.911
PROGRAMS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES

02:07:32.978 --> 02:07:33.879
THAT THEY'RE PUTTING IN PLACE

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:37.049
NOW. EASIER JUST TO SUSTAIN A

02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:39.551
LONG TERM BASIS. SO I THINK

02:07:39.618 --> 02:07:41.053
THAT- AND IT CONCLUDES OUR

02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:42.121
COMMENTS BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO

NOTE THAT- MUCH OF THAT ISN'T

02:09:42.908 --> 02:09:45.077
REALLY AVAILABLE FOR ON GOING

02:09:45.144 --> 02:09:45.711

ON PERSONS STIRS- YOU BASICALLY

02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:09.334
MENTIONED THAT. INDIA NOT YEARS

DISTRICTS ARE GOING IT IS-

02:10:13.705 --> 02:10:15.507

02:10:24.483 --> 02:10:25.017
COMMITMENT TO DO THAT A LARGER

02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:28.654
COMMITMENT. I THINK OUR CONCERN

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.289
IS THAT THE DEFERRALS THE

02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:33.325
PENSION COST INCREASES IN

02:10:33.392 --> 02:10:33.825
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO C.

02:10:33.892 --> 02:10:36.061
MANAGEABLE TO US. WITH THAT THE

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:37.863
COAL- THE THREE POINT 84% FOR

02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:39.731
LCS SELF. I THINK DISTRICTS CAN

02:10:39.798 --> 02:10:41.833
COVER ALL OF THOSE COST

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:42.868
INCREASES THEY'RE FACING IN

02:10:42.935 --> 02:10:44.203
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. BUT THE

02:10:44.269 --> 02:10:46.238
INCREASES IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:48.073
THREE ARE. MUCH LARGER ONE

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:49.241
POINT SIX BILLION THAT'S

02:10:49.308 --> 02:10:50.742
POTENTIALLY EVEN LARGER THAN

02:10:50.809 --> 02:10:52.177
THE COLA DISTRICTS MIGHT EXPECT

02:10:52.244 --> 02:10:54.346
RECEIVE NEXT YEAR. AND SO WE

02:10:54.413 --> 02:10:55.881
THINK YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO

02:10:55.948 --> 02:10:56.448
BE IN A POSITION WHERE IN A

02:10:56.515 --> 02:11:02.321
YEAR FROM NOW. DISTRICTS. ARE

02:11:02.387 --> 02:11:02.955
FACING VERY DIFFICULT INCREASE-

02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:03.855
THERE BUT HAVING TO MOVE. PEDAL

02:11:03.922 --> 02:11:04.556
AND SOME OF THE- OF MY

02:11:04.623 --> 02:11:05.857
IMPLEMENT. SO WE THINK USING

02:11:05.924 --> 02:11:07.159
SOME OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:08.560
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IN

02:11:08.627 --> 02:11:10.229
THIS YEAR- COULD MAKE FOR A

02:11:10.295 --> 02:11:14.366
MUCH. EASIER A LESS DIFFICULT

02:11:14.433 --> 02:11:15.000
BUDGET CONVERSATION A YEAR FROM

02:11:15.067 --> 02:11:16.235
NOW. THIS IS A DO YOU HAVE A

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:20.172
NUMBER. SURE SO ONE REASONABLE

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:21.173
ONE KIND OF NUMBER TO PUT OUT

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:22.341
THERE WOULD BE EIGHT HUNDRED

02:11:22.407 --> 02:11:23.976
MILLION- THAT WOULD BUY DOWN

02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:25.344
HALF OF THE ONE POINT SIX

02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:27.346
BILLION INCREASE IN COSTS AND

02:11:27.412 --> 02:11:29.014
WOULD CREATE MORE OF A FAST

02:11:29.081 --> 02:11:29.848
MOVING SUBJECT TO REVIEW FROM

02:11:29.915 --> 02:11:31.750
THIS YEAR- THROUGH THE NEXT

02:11:31.817 --> 02:11:34.820
SEVERAL YEARS. SO TO. THE

02:11:34.886 --> 02:11:36.088
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EIGHT

02:11:36.154 --> 02:11:38.323
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION. CORRECT

02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:39.891
AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

02:11:39.958 --> 02:11:41.760
ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION

02:11:41.827 --> 02:11:43.462
AND IS THAT IN A MILLION ON THE

02:11:43.528 --> 02:11:45.397
STREET SIDE OF THE PER SIDE OR

02:11:45.464 --> 02:11:47.366
WAS THAT A COMBINATION OF. THAT

02:11:47.432 --> 02:11:48.800
WOULD BE A COMBINATION THE END

02:11:48.867 --> 02:11:50.202
OF THE A COMBINATION OF BOTH

02:11:50.269 --> 02:11:51.203
MOST OF THAT IS RELATED TO

02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:52.904
STORIES JUST BECAUSE DISTRICTS

02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:55.741
HAVE MORE OF THEIR PAYROLL- FOR

02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:56.241
TEACHERS ON CERTIFICATED

02:11:56.308 --> 02:11:59.211
EMPLOYEES- AND THAT WOULD BE AT

02:11:59.278 --> 02:12:00.879
THE- THE NUMBERS THAT-

02:12:00.946 --> 02:12:01.980
DEPARTMENT FINANCE MENTIONED

02:12:02.047 --> 02:12:04.082
EARLIER WITH THE- I BELIEVE

02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:05.117
THAT WERE APPROVED IN THE

02:12:05.183 --> 02:12:07.552
TWENTY. TWENTY BUDGET PLAN- SO

02:12:07.619 --> 02:12:08.854
THAT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION YOU

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:10.222
ARE CORRECT WOULD BE ON TOP OF

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:11.523
THAT RELEASED THE STATE HAS

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:12.891
ALREADY PROVIDED. THE

02:12:12.958 --> 02:12:13.825
DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT IT

02:12:13.892 --> 02:12:15.527
WOULD BE A DISTRICTS WOULD

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:16.695
RECEIVE IT IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

02:12:16.762 --> 02:12:18.397
THREE. WHEREAS THE PREVIOUS

02:12:18.463 --> 02:12:21.466
ALLOCATION OF OVER TWENTY

02:12:21.533 --> 02:12:22.200
TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE

02:12:22.267 --> 02:12:22.901
TWENTY TWO. SO YOU'RE THERE

02:12:22.968 --> 02:12:24.069
YOU'RE THINKING ANOTHER EIGHT

02:12:24.136 --> 02:12:25.404
HUNDRED MILLION- DOES THE

02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:26.471
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE A

02:12:26.538 --> 02:12:28.307
COMMENT ON THAT IS THERE. DO DO

02:12:28.373 --> 02:12:29.608
DO THEY HAVE A CONCERN THAT THE

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:30.976
OUT YEARS THAT THE PERSON'S

02:12:31.043 --> 02:12:32.911
RESPONSE ARE GOING TO. BE A

02:12:32.978 --> 02:12:34.146
SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON DISTRICTS

02:12:34.212 --> 02:12:35.881
AND- MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:37.883
ABOUT. ADDRESSING THAT UP

02:12:37.949 --> 02:12:43.755
FRONT. I SEE THIS YEAR. AGAIN

02:12:43.822 --> 02:12:45.590
ORDER TO FINANCE- MISTER

CLINTON MEMBERS ARE PRECINCT-

02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:48.994
THE QUESTION AND CERTAINLY

02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:51.663
VALIDATE THINK WE- WE VALUE YOU

02:12:51.730 --> 02:12:55.734
KNOW THE ON GOING. COST

02:12:55.801 --> 02:12:56.968
RESEARCH I WANT TO SAY

02:12:57.035 --> 02:12:59.071
RESTRICTION BUT- THAT ELEAZAR

02:12:59.137 --> 02:13:01.340
FACING- STARS COURSE COST BEING

02:13:01.406 --> 02:13:03.208
ONE OF THE MANY AND WHILE WE

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:04.710
DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL STANCE

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:06.211
ON YOU KNOW THE L. A. O. SMITH

02:13:06.278 --> 02:13:08.046
IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL PROPOSAL-

02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:09.448
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT

02:13:09.514 --> 02:13:12.284
WE ARE AWARE OF AND- LOOKING

02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:12.851
FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THE

02:13:12.918 --> 02:13:14.820

THAT WAS NON PROPOSITION NINETY

02:13:33.472 --> 02:13:34.573
EIGHT GENERAL FUND AND SO THEY

02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:35.273
WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.541
CONVERSATION AROUND-

02:13:36.608 --> 02:13:38.243

SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS ARE

02:14:39.671 --> 02:14:41.139
SIGNIFICANT COST FACTORS FOR

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:42.507

ERIN PUBLIC FINANCE APPRECIATE

02:15:44.135 --> 02:15:46.738
THE QUESTION- UP FOR THE

02:15:46.805 --> 02:15:48.206
MINISTRATION I THINK NOW WE

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:50.575

THE PEARLS AS WELL- CERTAINLY

02:16:02.654 --> 02:16:03.822
COMPLICATES MATTERS EVEN MORE

GUARANTEED- IS LARGELY TAKEN UP

02:16:12.531 --> 02:16:13.465
WITH JUST GETTING US BACK TO

02:16:13.532 --> 02:16:15.033
WHERE WE WERE. AND THAT WAS A

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:16.801
HUGE PART OF A CALCULUS PROBLEM

02:16:16.868 --> 02:16:18.236
WE WERE CONTEMPLATING HOW TO

02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:20.171
APPLY THE COLA I WOULD NOTE-

02:16:20.238 --> 02:16:21.940
THAT COUNTY ALSO THE VEGETATION

02:16:22.007 --> 02:16:23.642
WE ARE ACTUALLY PROPOSING THE

02:16:23.708 --> 02:16:25.544
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO. APPLY

MAKE THAT- THAT QUICK NOTE AND

02:16:34.753 --> 02:16:36.488
OTHER THAN THAT- WE FELT THAT

THIS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:40.592
PROPOSE MAKES- THE MOST KIND OF

02:16:40.659 --> 02:16:41.760
APPROPRIATE MIX OF BONDS WITH

02:16:41.826 --> 02:16:43.895
AND EVERYTHING ELSE BETWEEN ALL

02:16:43.962 --> 02:16:44.529
THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVE

02:16:44.596 --> 02:16:46.298
A COLA- DO MEDIA ACTION IN THE

02:16:46.364 --> 02:16:49.601
EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS- AND TO

ONGOING COSTS MOVING FORWARD SO

02:16:54.573 --> 02:16:56.074
THAT WAS REALLY. THE ONE THAT

02:16:56.141 --> 02:16:56.975
WE WERE TRYING TO LOOK THROUGH

02:16:57.042 --> 02:16:58.743
AND BY WE APPROACH IT- IN THE

02:16:58.810 --> 02:16:59.945
WAY THAT WE DID I WOULD NOTE

02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:01.880
THAT WE IT AT A PANEL WE'RE

02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:03.081

02:54:30.193 --> 02:54:32.461
JUST. REALLY HAS A DIFFERENT

02:54:32.528 --> 02:54:34.130
PERSPECTIVE HOW WE LOOK AT OUR

02:54:34.197 --> 02:54:35.298

THEY'VE BEEN ONE OF THOSE

02:54:41.671 --> 02:54:43.172
STABLE DISTRICTS IN OUR REGION

DISTRESSED DISTRICT AS AN

02:54:54.217 --> 02:54:55.318
EXAMPLE OF THAT THOUSAND WE

02:54:55.384 --> 02:54:57.787
HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND HOW THE

02:54:57.854 --> 02:55:00.189
STATE. SHOULD CONSIDER. THESE

02:55:00.256 --> 02:55:03.125
ENROLLMENT CLASS- AS WE AS WE

02:55:03.192 --> 02:55:04.427
LOOK AT THIS FROM A BUDGET

02:55:04.493 --> 02:55:07.964

OUR THEIR DISTRICTS AND THEY'L

02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:22.178
GROW FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

DISTRICT BY WAY OF ENROLLMENT

02:55:25.882 --> 02:55:27.617
THEY FORECASTED GROWTH AGAIN

02:55:27.683 --> 02:55:30.152
THIS YEAR IN FACT THEY GAVE- A

02:55:30.219 --> 02:55:32.221
LOT OF DATA IN INPUT TO THE

02:55:32.288 --> 02:55:34.490
CONVERSATIONS- THAT THE

THEY PROJECTED. FOR- OF JUST

02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:03.152
OVER HUNDRED. THEY'VE ENDED UP

02:56:03.219 --> 02:56:04.420
WITH THE CLIP YEAR OVER YEAR

02:56:04.487 --> 02:56:06.455

SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENT. WELCOME

02:56:11.694 --> 02:56:13.930
CHANGE FROM WHERE THEY

02:56:13.996 --> 02:56:16.198
ANTICIPATED THEY WOULD BE SO

02:56:16.265 --> 02:56:18.567
FROM A BUDGET STANDPOINT FROM

02:56:18.634 --> 02:56:20.569
AN EXPENDITURE STANDPOINT. THE

02:56:20.636 --> 02:56:22.438
BUDGET FOR THE HIGHER NUMBER OF

02:56:22.505 --> 02:56:25.408
STUDENTS SO THAT THEY WERE

02:56:25.474 --> 02:56:26.809
PREPARED TO SERVE THEM- KERR

02:56:26.876 --> 02:56:28.544
AND NOW. IS ONGOING AND THEY

02:56:28.611 --> 02:56:29.779
DON'T HAVE THESE ANSWERS YET

02:56:29.845 --> 02:56:33.816
YEAH. BUT AS TO THE REASONS WHY

02:56:33.883 --> 02:56:35.051
THEY CAN CERTAINLY HAVE THEY

02:56:35.117 --> 02:56:37.019
THEY CERTAINLY KNOW THE ANSWERS

02:56:37.086 --> 02:56:38.220
TO THE DAY ARE CAN LOOK AT THE

02:56:38.287 --> 02:56:40.456
DATA. FOR SOME ANSWERS ABOUT

02:56:40.523 --> 02:56:42.658
50% OF THAT DROP IN ENROLLMENT

02:56:42.725 --> 02:56:44.527
FOR ALL GROWTH IS IN TKA

02:56:44.593 --> 02:56:45.594
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND

02:56:45.661 --> 02:56:48.064
KINDERGARTEN ARM THAT IS A

02:56:48.130 --> 02:56:49.932
TREND THAT WE ARE SEEING WHEN

02:56:49.999 --> 02:56:51.500
WE LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS

02:56:51.567 --> 02:56:52.868
DATA WE DON'T HAVE STATEWIDE

02:56:52.935 --> 02:56:55.338
DATA YET BY GRADE. SPAN BUT IF

02:56:55.404 --> 02:56:58.207
YOU LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL DATE

02:56:58.274 --> 02:56:58.774
DISTRICTS AND WE ENGAGE WITH

02:56:58.841 --> 02:57:00.643
THEM. THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS-

02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:02.645
THAT'S A VERY FREQUENT-

02:57:02.712 --> 02:57:04.780
CITATION IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT

02:57:04.847 --> 02:57:07.083
PIECE OF THEIR- IN ROMAN

02:57:07.149 --> 02:57:08.651
DECLINE IS IN THOSE VERY EARLY

02:57:08.718 --> 02:57:10.820
GRADES. AS YOU APPRECIATE THAT

02:57:10.886 --> 02:57:13.122
CAN BE VERY FRIGHTENING BECAUSE

02:57:13.189 --> 02:57:13.723
IF THOSE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY

02:57:13.789 --> 02:57:16.258
GONE- THEN WE WASHED UP FOR THE

02:57:16.325 --> 02:57:18.928
NEXT THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YEARS-

02:57:18.995 --> 02:57:20.629
BERMAN ROMAN STANDPOINT. WHAT

02:57:20.696 --> 02:57:22.298
WE SUSPECT IS THAT THOSE

02:57:22.365 --> 02:57:23.766
PARTICULAR GRADES ARE MORE

02:57:23.833 --> 02:57:25.601
HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE

02:57:25.668 --> 02:57:27.436
PANDEMIC THAN OTHER GRADES

02:57:27.503 --> 02:57:32.775
BECAUSE MANY PARENTS. CHOSE

02:57:32.842 --> 02:57:35.845
CHOSEN TO LEAD THEIR- KID- AT

02:57:35.911 --> 02:57:36.779
HOME AND NOT IN THEM IN

02:57:36.846 --> 02:57:38.214
DISTANCE LEARNING OR VIRTUAL

02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:40.416
EDUCATION AND SO WHAT WILL BE

02:57:40.483 --> 02:57:42.051
IMPORTANT FOR DISTRICT LIKE ALL

02:57:42.118 --> 02:57:43.652
GROVE AND FRANKLY ALL DISTRICTS

02:57:43.719 --> 02:57:45.688
THAT ARE EXPERIENCING A DECLINE

02:57:45.755 --> 02:57:46.922
IS TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR

02:57:46.989 --> 02:57:49.425
COMMUNITY ON A DEEPER BASIS TO

02:57:49.492 --> 02:57:50.926
UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE KIDS ARE

02:57:50.993 --> 02:57:52.661
THEY NEED TO REACH OUT TO THOSE

02:57:52.728 --> 02:57:53.896
SO IF THEY HAVE PRESCHOOL

02:57:53.963 --> 02:57:55.664
PROGRAMS AND THOSE KIDS DIDN'T

02:57:55.731 --> 02:57:58.601
SHOW UP IN TKA- THIS PAST YEAR

02:57:58.667 --> 02:57:59.602
THEY'VE GOT THEY KNOW THOSE

02:57:59.668 --> 02:58:01.070
PARENTS ARE IN THOSE FAMILIES

02:58:01.137 --> 02:58:02.805
ARE THEY CAN REACH OUT TO.

02:58:02.872 --> 02:58:04.673
THEIR KINDERGARTEN KIDS IT

02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:05.508
DIDN'T SHOW UP BUT THEY WERE

02:58:05.574 --> 02:58:07.843
THERE IN TJ THIS PAST YEAR THEY

02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:10.012
KNOW WHO THEY ARE- THIS WILL BE

02:58:10.079 --> 02:58:11.847
IMPORTANT IN THEIR ANALYSIS

02:58:11.914 --> 02:58:13.282
GOING FORWARD BUT IT WILL ALSO

02:58:13.349 --> 02:58:15.484
BE IMPORTANT AND HOW THE-

02:58:15.551 --> 02:58:17.386
STRUCTURED THEIR INTERVENTIONS

02:58:17.453 --> 02:58:19.622

TRAILER BILL PROVISIONS- THAT-

02:59:57.319 --> 02:59:59.755
WE BELIEVED WOULD STRENGTHEN-

02:59:59.822 --> 03:00:01.957
FISCAL OVERSIGHT REALLY IN MOST

03:00:02.024 --> 03:00:03.425

DEPTH CONVERSATION- WE DID NOT

03:00:40.296 --> 03:00:41.397
BRING THOSE BACK UP BECAUSE

03:00:41.463 --> 03:00:43.365
WE'RE STILL IN THE PANDEMIC I

03:00:43.432 --> 03:00:44.200
WOULD HOPE THEY'LL BE AN

03:00:44.266 --> 03:00:45.834
OPPORTUNITY TO. BRING SOME OF

03:00:45.901 --> 03:00:46.936
THOSE BACK UP AND HAVE MORE IN

03:00:47.002 --> 03:00:49.138
DEPTH DISCUSSION- IN THE FUTURE

03:00:49.205 --> 03:00:50.472
BUT I PROBABLY WOULD GROUP THE

03:00:50.539 --> 03:00:52.641
PENDING ITEMS- IN THREE

03:00:52.708 --> 03:00:55.978
CATEGORIES. ONE IS-

03:00:56.045 --> 03:00:58.647
STRENGTHENING THE REPORTING OUT

NOT EVEN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

03:01:10.759 --> 03:01:12.861
BUT ON REPRESENT IT WELL WE DID

03:01:12.928 --> 03:01:14.530
GET A GOOD CONVERSATION ON THAT

03:01:14.597 --> 03:01:16.599
STARTED LAST YEAR BUT BUT

03:01:16.665 --> 03:01:18.534
SIMPLY WITH THE PANDEMIC.

03:01:18.601 --> 03:01:20.769
INTERRUPTED FRUITFUL

03:01:20.836 --> 03:01:22.571
CONVERSATION THE SECOND

03:01:22.638 --> 03:01:25.241
CATEGORY- IS I THINK WE NEED TO

03:01:25.307 --> 03:01:29.645
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT- WHAT. WHAT

03:01:29.712 --> 03:01:31.413
THE BENEFIT IS SERVED BY OUR

03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:33.482
CURRENT PROVISIONS FOR FISCAL

ON DATA AND BACKGROUND FOR

03:01:44.159 --> 03:01:45.928
THAT. BUT THAT DISCUSSION I

03:01:45.995 --> 03:01:49.365
THINK OUR- NEEDS WITH SOME

03:01:49.431 --> 03:01:52.268
POINT TO SURFACE- IN AB AND

03:01:52.334 --> 03:01:54.436
HAVE A- IN DEPTH CONVERSATION

03:01:54.503 --> 03:01:55.571
ABOUT THOSE CATEGORIES OF

03:01:55.638 --> 03:01:56.905
DISTRICTS AND WHAT THE REAL

03:01:56.972 --> 03:01:59.975
BENEFIT IS TO THOSE- THOSE

03:02:00.042 --> 03:02:03.746
CLASSIFICATIONS. AND THEN THE

03:02:03.812 --> 03:02:05.981
THIRD WOULD BE- OPTIONS. ARE

03:02:06.048 --> 03:02:08.017
SPECIFICALLY IN MY MIND FOR THE

03:02:08.083 --> 03:02:09.018
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT TO

03:02:09.084 --> 03:02:09.952
STRENGTHEN THE COUNTY

03:02:10.019 --> 03:02:11.253
SUPERINTENDENT'S ROLE WHEN THE

03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:13.422
DISTRICT IS NOT PROPERTIES- OUR

03:02:13.489 --> 03:02:15.257
CURRENT OVERSIGHT SYSTEM IS

03:02:15.324 --> 03:02:16.525
BUILT ON A PROMISE OF

03:02:16.592 --> 03:02:17.860
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE

03:02:17.926 --> 03:02:19.428
DISTRICT. AND THE COUNTY

03:02:19.495 --> 03:02:22.064
SUPERINTENDENT IT'S BUILT ON A

03:02:22.131 --> 03:02:24.800
PREMISE BACK IN YOU KNOW THE

03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:25.467
NINETEEN NINETIES WITH AB

03:02:25.534 --> 03:02:27.569
TWELVE HUNDRED- IT'S BUILT ON

03:02:27.636 --> 03:02:29.805
THIS PREMISE THAT. ARE BOTH

03:02:29.872 --> 03:02:32.708
PARTIES RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S

03:02:32.775 --> 03:02:35.244
A PROBLEM- BAND THAT THEY WANT

03:02:35.311 --> 03:02:37.613
TO IMPROVE OVER THAT PROBLEM IN

03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:39.081
MAKE AND TAKE APPROPRIATE

03:02:39.148 --> 03:02:41.183
CORRECTIVE ACTION IN JOINTLY

03:02:41.250 --> 03:02:43.118
TOGETHER MOVE DOWN THE PATH.

03:02:43.185 --> 03:02:44.653
WHEN WE HAVE A DISTRICT THAT IS

03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:45.954
NOT ON BOARD AND WE HAVE A

03:02:46.021 --> 03:02:47.756
NUMBER OF THOSE EXAMPLES ARE

03:02:47.823 --> 03:02:50.693
THEN THEY'RE FISCAL RECOVERY IS

03:02:50.759 --> 03:02:53.462
DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY- AND THE

03:02:53.529 --> 03:02:54.730
CHALLENGE FOR THE ARE COUNTY

03:02:54.797 --> 03:02:56.799
SUPERINTENDENTS I'M INCREASES

03:02:56.865 --> 03:02:59.034
EVEN MORE. AND SO LOOKING AT

03:02:59.101 --> 03:03:00.969
SOME OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN

03:03:01.036 --> 03:03:06.642
THE DISTRICT DOES NOT- TIMELY-

03:03:06.709 --> 03:03:07.710
DOCTOR FISCAL STABILIZATION

03:03:07.776 --> 03:03:10.646
PLAN- FOR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT

03:03:10.713 --> 03:03:12.348
TO POTENTIALLY A DOCTOR

03:03:12.414 --> 03:03:14.316
POTENTIALLY TO PREPARE. AND

03:03:14.383 --> 03:03:16.085
IMPOSE IT ON A DISTRICT ISN'T

03:03:16.151 --> 03:03:18.387
AS ONE EXAMPLE- SO THOSE WOULD

03:03:18.454 --> 03:03:20.923
BE THE THREE CATEGORIES I WOULD

03:03:20.989 --> 03:03:22.224
IDENTIFY SAWYER WITH RESPECT

03:03:22.291 --> 03:03:24.993
TO- POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:31.967
CONVERSATION. OKAY THANK YOU.

03:03:32.034 --> 03:03:32.534
ASSEMBLY MEMBER VIA THAT S.

03:03:32.601 --> 03:03:35.104
THANK YOU I'M- STILL IN-

03:03:35.170 --> 03:03:36.472
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THIRTY EIGHT

03:03:36.538 --> 03:03:38.073
ARE DISTRICTS ARE SMALLER AND

03:03:38.140 --> 03:03:40.376
WE HAVE BEEN- EXPERIENCING

03:03:40.442 --> 03:03:40.943
DECLINE ENROLLMENT THAT IS A

03:03:41.009 --> 03:03:44.947
CONCERN- AND I. ACTUALLY THINK

03:03:45.013 --> 03:03:46.582
THERE'S ADDITIONAL CONCERN WHEN

03:03:46.648 --> 03:03:47.649
IT COMES TO HIGH SCHOOL

03:03:47.716 --> 03:03:49.418
STUDENTS ARE SEVEN THROUGH THE

03:03:49.485 --> 03:03:52.154
TWELVE- PARTICULARLY THIS YEAR

03:03:52.221 --> 03:03:54.723
AS IT'S NOW GOING ON A YEAR AS

03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:55.624
OF STUDENTS BEING OUT OF

03:03:55.691 --> 03:03:58.327
SCHOOL- PARTICULAR ATHLETES WHO

03:03:58.394 --> 03:03:59.928
ARE I AM AWARE ARE PLAYING OUT

03:03:59.995 --> 03:04:01.797
OF STATE. AND PARENTS ARE

03:04:01.864 --> 03:04:03.999
DECIDING THAT IF THEIR CHILDREN

03:04:04.066 --> 03:04:06.535
ARE REALLY GOING TO BE ENGAGED

03:04:06.602 --> 03:04:07.536
IN ATHLETICS AND ANOTHER STATE

03:04:07.603 --> 03:04:10.105
MAY BE- A PLACE FOR THEM TO DO

03:04:10.172 --> 03:04:12.274
THAT- THEY'RE DOING THAT NOW.

03:04:12.341 --> 03:04:14.309
WOULD IT BE YOUR RECOMMENDATION

03:04:14.376 --> 03:04:16.211
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER

03:04:16.278 --> 03:04:17.880
YOU KNOW EXTENDING AN EXTENSION

03:04:17.946 --> 03:04:20.549
OF THE HOLD HARMLESS FOR THE

03:04:20.616 --> 03:04:21.383
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEAR.

03:04:21.450 --> 03:04:23.619
AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION-

03:04:23.685 --> 03:04:25.587
WHAT WOULD BE THE ADVANTAGES OF

03:04:25.654 --> 03:04:28.424
ELEAZAR IF THE STATE REVERSED

03:04:28.490 --> 03:04:31.326
OR PAY DOWN THE DEFERRALS MORE

03:04:31.393 --> 03:04:35.364
QUICKLY. OKAY ON THE FIRST

03:04:35.431 --> 03:04:38.634
TOPIC OF THE I. OF THE SPECIAL

03:04:38.700 --> 03:04:40.035
EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS IN PLACE

03:04:40.102 --> 03:04:42.871
DUE TO THE PANDEMIC- IF TRULY

03:04:42.938 --> 03:04:43.839
WE SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF

03:04:43.906 --> 03:04:44.740
THE TUNNEL AS THE STATE

03:04:44.807 --> 03:04:46.909
SUPERINTENDENT. IN HIS COMMENTS

03:04:46.975 --> 03:04:49.011
EARLIER THIS MORNING ALLUDED TO

03:04:49.077 --> 03:04:50.546
AND I THINK MANY OF US ARE VERY

03:04:50.612 --> 03:04:53.115
HOPEFUL FOR- AND WE'RE LEFT

03:04:53.182 --> 03:04:55.083
WITH SIMPLY EXCEPTIONS NEXT

03:04:55.150 --> 03:04:57.786
YEAR AS OPPOSED TO THE NORM. OF

03:04:57.853 --> 03:04:59.254
THE DISTANCE LEARNING IS THE

03:04:59.321 --> 03:05:01.757
EXCEPTION- THEN NOW I DON'T SEE

03:05:01.824 --> 03:05:03.625
ANY REASON TO CONTINUE AT A

03:05:03.692 --> 03:05:04.960
DISTRICTS THAT ARE DECLINING

03:05:05.027 --> 03:05:06.762
WILL REVERT BACK TO THEIR

03:05:06.829 --> 03:05:08.530
TRADITIONAL EIGHTY A HOLD

03:05:08.597 --> 03:05:10.566
HARMLESS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY

03:05:10.632 --> 03:05:12.568
TWO. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS

03:05:12.634 --> 03:05:14.403
STILL BE FOR FUNDING PURPOSES

03:05:14.470 --> 03:05:17.039
BE USING AGAIN THERE NINETEEN

03:05:17.105 --> 03:05:18.173
TWENTY DATA AS THEY ARE DOING

03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:20.142
THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT. YOU'RE

03:05:20.209 --> 03:05:22.544
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO. BE FUNDED

03:05:22.611 --> 03:05:24.413
ON CURRENT THE HIGHER CURRENT

03:05:24.480 --> 03:05:26.815
YEAR OR PRIOR YEAR. IN NEXT IN

03:05:26.882 --> 03:05:28.750
THE BUDGET YEAR PRIOR YEAR WILL

03:05:28.817 --> 03:05:30.085
BE NINETEEN TWENTY BECAUSE

03:05:30.152 --> 03:05:32.588
WE'RE NOT CURRENTLY COLLECTING

03:05:32.654 --> 03:05:35.324
I'M AT ANY DATA IN TWENTY

03:05:35.390 --> 03:05:36.525
TWENTY ONE. SO THEY'LL HAVE A

03:05:36.592 --> 03:05:38.393
WHOLE ANOTHER YEAR IF YOU WILL

03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:40.462
AND HOLD HARMLESS- WITH RESPECT

03:05:40.529 --> 03:05:41.530
TO THEIR FUNDING BEFORE THEY

03:05:41.597 --> 03:05:42.431
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEIR

03:05:42.498 --> 03:05:44.433
DECLINE. ULTIMATELY DISTRICTS

03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:45.934
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE DECLINE

03:05:46.001 --> 03:05:48.337
THEY HAVETO ADJUST- STAFFING

03:05:48.403 --> 03:05:50.439
IN PROGRAMS AND SERVICES A TO

03:05:50.506 --> 03:05:51.773
GO HAND IN HAND WITH THE SIZE

03:05:51.840 --> 03:05:53.375
OF THE OF THE POPULATION

03:05:53.442 --> 03:05:56.979
THEY'RE SERVING- AND SO- I

03:05:57.045 --> 03:05:58.313
BELIEVE THAT. THE HOLD HARMLESS

03:05:58.380 --> 03:06:01.316
FOR THE PANDEMIC- HAS SERVED

03:06:01.383 --> 03:06:03.252
EVERYBODY. HAS SERVED ITS

03:06:03.318 --> 03:06:05.320
PURPOSE INSTANCE SERVICE WHILE

03:06:05.387 --> 03:06:07.556
ON IN AND THEN MOVING FORWARD

03:06:07.623 --> 03:06:11.159
THAT WOULD GO BACK TO THE NORM-

03:06:11.226 --> 03:06:14.630
WITH RESPECT TO- OPTIONS FOR

03:06:14.696 --> 03:06:16.198
DISTRICTS IT MAY HAVE TO CLOSE

03:06:16.265 --> 03:06:23.605
ON A TEMPORARY BASIS- NEXT YEAR

03:06:23.672 --> 03:06:24.406
I THINK- JUST GOT HOME. OF

03:06:24.473 --> 03:06:26.041
DEPART FINANCE ADDRESS IN THE

03:06:26.108 --> 03:06:28.343
GOVERNOR'S- THEY ARE LOOKING

03:06:28.410 --> 03:06:30.078
TO. CREATE AN OPTION FOR THOSE

03:06:30.145 --> 03:06:34.616
DISTRICTS. TO AGAIN DEAL WITH

03:06:34.683 --> 03:06:36.885
THAT EXCEPTION MAY BE CREATED

03:06:36.952 --> 03:06:39.855
BY A LOCAL HEALTH- RESTRICTIONS

03:06:39.922 --> 03:06:45.193
OUR DECISION TO CLOSE- IN

03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:46.662
PERSON INSTRUCTION EITHER

03:06:46.728 --> 03:06:48.096
TEMPORARILY OR EVEN A LONGER

03:06:48.163 --> 03:06:50.832
TERM- IN THE NEXT YEAR AS PART

03:06:50.899 --> 03:06:52.634
OF THIS IS VERY FLUID.

03:06:52.701 --> 03:06:55.103
OBVIOUSLY AS AS WE SEE

03:06:55.170 --> 03:06:57.072
IMPROVEMENT- AND GO THROUGH THE

03:06:57.139 --> 03:06:58.640
SEARCHES AND I THINK

03:06:58.707 --> 03:06:59.942
EVERYBODY'S PROBABLY ON THE

03:07:00.008 --> 03:07:01.877
SAME PAGE IN THAT WE WE'VE GOT

03:07:01.944 --> 03:07:02.744
TO CONTINUE TO BE SOMEWHAT

03:07:02.811 --> 03:07:04.680
FLEXIBLE HERE. WITH RESPECT TO

03:07:04.746 --> 03:07:05.213
YOUR SECOND QUESTION ON

03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:07.616
DEFERRALS ON CASH DEFERRALS

03:07:07.683 --> 03:07:10.452
ARE- NOT A POPULAR THING IN THE

03:07:10.519 --> 03:07:12.521
FIELD WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

03:07:12.588 --> 03:07:13.855
SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS

03:07:13.922 --> 03:07:19.227
YEAR WITH THE TWO- ARE. OUR

03:07:19.294 --> 03:07:21.063
KINSTON SOMETIMES BE HIT

03:07:21.129 --> 03:07:23.665
HARDER- BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY

03:07:23.732 --> 03:07:24.666
HAVE FEWER RESOURCES TO

03:07:24.733 --> 03:07:26.969
BALANCE- I THINK DISTRICTS

03:07:27.035 --> 03:07:29.471
OVERALL FOR THIS YEAR I GIVEN

03:07:29.538 --> 03:07:30.672
THE SIZE OF THE DEFERRALS IN

03:07:30.739 --> 03:07:32.574
THE COMPLEXITIES AROUND IT. ARE

03:07:32.641 --> 03:07:34.242
MANAGING OUT VERY WELL NOW THAT

03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:36.178
YES THEY HAVE YET TO BE A

03:07:36.244 --> 03:07:37.646
REALLY IMPACTED BECAUSE THEY GO

03:07:37.713 --> 03:07:39.982
INTO PLACE. IN JUST A COUPLE

03:07:40.048 --> 03:07:41.750
WEEKS IN FEBRUARY BUT THEY'VE

03:07:41.817 --> 03:07:43.518
ALL DONE THEY'RE PLANNING TO

03:07:43.585 --> 03:07:45.120
ACCOUNT FOR THAT- THEY DID THAT

03:07:45.187 --> 03:07:46.989
IN THE FALL. MOST OF MARIN

03:07:47.055 --> 03:07:48.890
TRAINS POOLS OF TAX AND REVENUE

03:07:48.957 --> 03:07:51.026
ANTICIPATION NOTE RULES IF YOU

03:07:51.093 --> 03:07:52.127
THEIR COUNTIES ARE THROUGH

03:07:52.194 --> 03:07:53.395
STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION THE

03:07:53.462 --> 03:07:54.997
STATE TREASURER DIFFERENT THAN

03:07:55.063 --> 03:07:56.198
THE GREAT RECESSION STEPPED UP

03:07:56.264 --> 03:07:58.400
AND CREATED A TRANSPORT. THIS

03:07:58.467 --> 03:08:00.302
YEAR AND WE- THROUGH THE

03:08:00.369 --> 03:08:03.739
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN SUPPORT-

03:08:03.805 --> 03:08:05.974
MADE THAT AVAILABLE- TO ALL

03:08:06.041 --> 03:08:07.476
TYPES OF DISTRICTS AND THEN

03:08:07.542 --> 03:08:09.177
THERE'S ANOTHER PROGRAM-

03:08:09.244 --> 03:08:10.345
THROUGH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE

03:08:10.412 --> 03:08:15.951
TO SUPPORT. CHARTER SCHOOLS-

03:08:16.018 --> 03:08:17.085
SHE CAN ADDRESSES BUT THERE

03:08:17.152 --> 03:08:18.487
WASN'T. PROCESS ALSO FOR

03:08:18.553 --> 03:08:20.288
DISTRICTS THAT DIDN'T LEAVE

03:08:20.355 --> 03:08:21.256
THEY CAN. MANAGE THEIR

03:08:21.323 --> 03:08:22.557
DEFERRALS AND WOULD MEET

03:08:22.624 --> 03:08:24.660
CERTAIN CRITERIA WELL THERE WAS

03:08:24.726 --> 03:08:26.662
AN APPLICATION PROCESS FOR.

03:08:26.728 --> 03:08:28.397
EXEMPTIONS FROM THE DEFERRALS

03:08:28.463 --> 03:08:30.165
AND CD IS BEEN THE ONE ON

03:08:30.232 --> 03:08:31.400
MANAGING OUT ALONG WITH

03:08:31.466 --> 03:08:33.335
FINANCING AND IN CAN SPEAK TO

03:08:33.402 --> 03:08:35.404
THAT. MY SENSE OVERALLS

03:08:35.470 --> 03:08:37.005
DISTRICTS HAVE MANAGED IT VERY

03:08:37.072 --> 03:08:39.908
VERY WELL- IS THERE A BENEFIT

03:08:39.975 --> 03:08:41.643
NOT TO HAVE DEFERRALS YES

03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:42.544
THERE'S A BENEFIT NOT TO HAVE

03:08:42.611 --> 03:08:44.846
DEFERRALS- I THINK THE

03:08:44.913 --> 03:08:46.615
ADMINISTRATION- CERTAINLY THEIR

03:08:46.682 --> 03:08:48.083
BUDGET PROPOSAL ACKNOWLEDGES

03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:49.451
THAT BY PAYING OFF. A

03:08:49.518 --> 03:08:51.486
SIGNIFICANT PIECE MORE THAN 70%

03:08:51.553 --> 03:08:53.722
OF THE EXISTING TO FOR ALSO-

03:08:53.789 --> 03:08:55.590
NOT THE PAIN I'M ALL OFF BUT

03:08:55.657 --> 03:08:58.927
THEN NOT CONTINUING- ONE SMALL

03:08:58.994 --> 03:09:01.329
ONE PIECE- THE DEFERRALS ARE

03:09:01.396 --> 03:09:07.602
COMPLICATED BY A SERIES. OF- A

03:09:07.669 --> 03:09:08.737
PROVISIONS ARE EVEN. THAN THEY

03:09:08.804 --> 03:09:10.005
WERE TO THE GREAT. WE NOW HAVE

03:09:10.072 --> 03:09:11.907
EDUCATION PROTECTION ACT WHICH

03:09:11.973 --> 03:09:14.309
CAME ABOUT AS WE EXITED THE

03:09:14.376 --> 03:09:16.511
GREAT RECESSION THAT OVERLAYS

03:09:16.578 --> 03:09:18.313
THIS AND COMPLICATES THINGS.

03:09:18.380 --> 03:09:20.816
ARM AND SO IT'S NOT BEEN THE

03:09:20.882 --> 03:09:23.151
EASIEST OF TOPICS CERTAINLY BUT

03:09:23.218 --> 03:09:24.920
