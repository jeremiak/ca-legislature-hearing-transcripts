THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS JOINT LET'S HEAD OF AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. AT THIS BILL OUR STUDENTS. WITH THIS AUDIT REQUEST. OF THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT. AN AUDIT. OF ALL PERSONAL PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF THE METROPOLITAN. WATER BOARD. IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. AND PROVIDE STATE OVERSIGHT. A WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY AS WELL AS PREVENT. WORK PLACE DISCRIMINATION. INCLUDING HARASSMENT BULLYING AND RETALIATION AND RELATED ISSUES IN LIGHT OF RECENT REPORTS RISING RAISING SERIOUS CONCERNS OVER METROPOLITANS HUMAN RESOURCE PRACTICES. ON FEBRUARY THE TWELFTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. TWENTY CURRENT AND FORMER STAFFERS HAVE COME FORWARD EXPOSING. A PATTERN OF COMPLAINTS ALLEGING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND BULLYING OF WOMEN WHO ENROLLED IN THE APPRENTICE PROGRAM AND METROPOLITAN METROPOLITAN WORKERS NEED A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THESE MATTERS. WHICH IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO PREVENT. OF THESE THINGS FROM TAKING PLACE. THE DAY IN JUSTICE IN IT WE FOUND BASED ON PEOPLE'S REPORTS IS THAT WOMEN AND LGBTQ PLUS INDIVIDUAL WORKERS AND METROPOLITAN HAVE BEEN HARASSED. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN EIGHTEEN WOMEN WORKING IN TRADE POSITIONS FOR THE DISTRICT AND SIX OF THEM FILED FORMAL COMPLAINTS. AFTER THEIR COMPLAINTS. THE WOMEN SAID THAT THEY WERE IGNORED. DISMISSED BY AGENCY OFFICIALS AS THEY COMPLAINED AND PLEADED FOR HELP. THREE SAID THAT THEY WERE PRESSURED TO CONTINUE WORKING AROUND MEN THAT MEN THAT THEY ACCUSED OF ABUSING OF ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR OR TO SEEKING LOW PAYING OTHER POSITIONS. ONE WOMAN WAS EVEN TRANSFERRED TO A FACILITY MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM HER HOME A MOVE THAT SPLIT HER FAMILY. APART. ON OCTOBER TWENTY SEVEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION WAS IITIATED BY THE METROPOLITAN PERSONNEL AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE. BUT THERE IS CONCERNS THAT INVESTIGATION WILL BE ADEQUATE TO. THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND FOCUS TOO NARROWLY. RATHER THAN TAKE A BROADER LOOK AT THE EMPLOYEES EXPERIENCE AND METROPOLITAN IN ORDER TO CREATE THE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES NECESSARY TO ENSURE WORKPLACE FREE FROM BULLYING DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT RETALIATION AND OTHER ABUSE ON THE JOB. MEMBERS WE MUST DO AND AT AND OF SUPPORT THIS RECOMMENDATION FOR AN AUDIENCE WE BELIEVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AS THE FORMER CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT THE STATE AUDITOR CAN GO IN AND DO A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND FORENSIC LOOK- THAT WAS SHARED SIGNIFICANT BUT A VERY VITAL IMPORTANT LIGHT ON WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHAT I VOTE- AUTHORIZING SUCH OUGHT TO BE DONE. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON AT THIS TIME I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. IF WE CAN HAVE THEM- GET ON THE LINE.

MANY MEMBERS MY NAME IS ELLEN MACKEY AS CHAIR OF THE ALBANY WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND A THIRTY YEAR DISTRICT EMPLOYEES I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE RAMPANT ABUSE FACING WORKERS PARTICULARLY WOMEN AND LGBTQ PEOPLE AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT'S BEEN DISMISSED ACCEPTED OR DOWNRIGHT PROMOTED BY MANAGEMENT.

A JARRING STATEMENT PARTIALLY EXPRESSED BY A TRANSITIONING NON BINARY PERSON WHO WAS PUBLICLY REPRIMANDED FOR HAVING A PROFITABLE IN THEIR EMAIL SIGNATURE BROUGHT BLOCK DURING PRIDE MONTH. ANOTHER JOKING EXAMPLE DISTRICT MANAGEMENT HIT A DESERT EMPLOYED BY FROM THE M. W. D. BOARD UNTIL AN LA TIMES ARTICLE EXPECTED. EVERYBODY WORKERS ACROSS DECADES HAVE BEEN SEVERELY DAMAGED BY THE UNFAIR TREATMENT INCLUDING SAFETY VIOLATIONS ADMINISTERED BY TO GET DISTRICT MANAGEMENT RULES ARE UNEVENLY APPLIED DEPENDING. ON WHETHER YOU ARE IN GROUP OR A GROUP. THIS LEGACY ABOUT NEED END THE PUBLIC IS WATCHING AND TO ME THAT AUDIT NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S MOVE ON TO MR SHANAHAN PLEASE. THANK YOU YOUR SALAS UNKNOWN MENTIONED LEADERS ON THE MEDIA NOT RUN THE AGENCY IN A MANNER WHICH SERVICE THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC. EFFORTS TO LIMIT OVERSIGHT RESTRICTING THE SCOPE OF THE ETHICS DEPARTMENT SUPPORTING CRONYISM JUST TO NAME A FEW HAS CREATED A CULTURE OF RETALIATION FAVORITISM AND FEAR. THE BOYS ARE AFRAID TO FILE COMPLAINTS OR GRIEVANCES THAT IT'LL BE HELD AGAINST THEM AND EFFECTIVE CAREERS DOZENS OF EMPLOYEES ARE REQUIRED TO FILE NDAS WHICH PAPERS OVER THE ABUSES AND WASTE PUBLIC MONEY DUE TO EVER INCREASING LEGAL COSTS AND SOMEONE SAID- NOT DISCLOSED TO THE BOARD. THE STATE AUDIT WOULD BE FAR MORE COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPARENT COMPLEMENT THE SHOW INVESTIGATION WHICH IS LIMITED TO FOUR ISSUES AND ONLY LOOKED AT OTHER MATTERS IF THEY ARE BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY EMPLOYEES. M. W. D. WAS PREVIOUSLY AUTUMN TWO THOUSAND THREE BUT LEADERSHIP FAILED TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMMITMENTS THEY MADE TO THE PUBLIC AND LEGISLATURE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH AND HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE NEW GM WAS COMMITTED TO FIXING ISSUES AT END OF THE DAY BUT COMPREHENSIVE STATE AUDIT INTO THESE MATTERS ALONG WITH THE SHAH REPORT WILL ONLY SERVE TO PROVIDE THE NEW GM. FORD AND REPRESENTATIVES WITH THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE CHANGE AT NWT. ALL EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY THOSE IN PUBLIC SERVICE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK FOR AN AGENCY THAT EXEMPLIFIES DIVERSITY FAIRNESS EQUITY AND INCLUSION. FREE FROM RETALIATION.

AS WELL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS ADDED TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND FOR YOUR- CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS AND GUIDANCE YOU ALONG WITH YOUR STAFF I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR SUPPORT- YOU JUST A QUICK PREAMBLE BEFORE BEFORE I BEGIN WE INITIALLY BEGAN WORKING ON THIS REQUEST JUST SO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES KNOW. BACK IN SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- AT THAT TIME GIVEN ALL THE DIFFERENT SHOOTINGS AND CASES WE WERE HEARING ABOUT I WANTED TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT. WHAT SOME OF THE DEEPER LINING ISSUES ARE AND SO WE CONTACTED THE- AUDITOR AND WE STARTED WORKING WITH HER ON FIGURING OUT WHAT THE LANGUAGE SHOULD BE. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BEST ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST OUTCOMES ARE GOING TO BE FROM A STUDY. FROM AN AUDIT AND SO SUMMER OF NINETEEN WE WORKED ON IT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LATE WE WERE ABLE TO- GET IT. PREPARED ENOUGH TO BE HEARD IN IN IN- THE AUGUST HEARING SO WE INTRODUCED IT IN TWENTY TWENTY. BECAUSE OF IT AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENED HERE WE ARE TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AUDIT IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES THAT ARE FREE FROM BIAS AND PREJUDICE. WE HAVE WITNESSED THE BIASED ACTIONS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FOR YEARS THE TRAGIC KILLING TWELVE GEORGE FLOYD. IN MINNEAPOLIS IN TWENTY TWENTY DREW HOW MUCH NEEDED ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. AND THAT UNFORTUNATE EVENT LED TO THIS ESSENTIAL LONG OVERDUE AUDIT. WITH OF GREATER EVEN GREATER CONVICTION. OUR AUDIT IS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTING INFORMATION RELATED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND PRISON GUARDS AFFILIATION. WITH SUBVERSIVE VIOLENT AND OR HE BASED ORGANIZATIONS. EVEN THOUGH. THERE IS NO CURRENT DEFINITION FOR HATE GROUPS WE. KNOW THAT THE TERM HATE AND CRIME. BUT LAW- DOES NOT MEAN RAGE ANGER OR GENERAL DISLIKE IT MEANS BIAS AGAINST PEOPLE OR GROUPS. WITH SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE DEFINED BY THE LAW. WE CAN DEDUCE THAT HATE GROUPS ARE THOSE THAT THREATEN TO PROMOTE ANIMOSITY BIAS OR MALICE ON THE BASIS OF THE VICTIMS PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL RACE COLOR RELIGION NATIONAL ORIGIN SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER GENDER IDENTITY OR DISABILITY. OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS OVER TATTOOED GANGS OF DEPUTIES IN THE LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WHICH DATES AS FAR BACK AS THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. THERE'S BEEN SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE EAST VALLEY SHERIFF'S STATION'S GANG INVOLVEMENT HAS RESULTED IN FAVORITISM SEXISM RACISM AND EVEN VIOLENCE. I'VE BEEN APPROACHED ABOUT CONCERNS REGARDING FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. USING THE LA SHERIFF'S AS AN EXAMPLE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT PREVENTS THEM FROM ORDERING DEPUTIES TO EXPOSE THEIR TATTOOS. HOWEVER ACCORDING TO LAURIE LEVENSON A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR WHO TEACHES CRIMINAL LAW AT LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL THOSE CONCERNS WOULD NOT APPLY IF THE TATTOOS ARE EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT IN A GROUP THAT ENGAGES IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. I HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AS STATED BEFORE WHO HELPED US DRAFT IS REQUEST AND ARE WE SURE THAT OUR REQUEST GIVES THEM ENOUGH. DISCRETION AND JUDGMENT TO PROPERLY CONDUCT THIS AUDIT WITHOUT THREATENING ANY INDIVIDUALS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS WITH THAT SAID I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WILL BE ABLE TO CONDUCT AN APPROPRIATE AUDIT THAT WILL PRODUCE INFORMATION. THAT HAS BEEN LONG OVERDUE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS AUDITS- ON THIS REQUEST TODAY. AND WITH ME I HAVE ARTIST AND MUSICIAN ALOE BLACC REPRESENTING MUSIC ARTISTS COALITION WHO WILL PROVIDE WITNESS TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF OUR AUDIT. THANK YOU.

WITHIN THE RANKS WHICH IS A STEP TOWARD A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. I WANTED TO COMMITTEE AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION- METAMODEL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- AS MISTER NAZARIAN OTHERS ARE REQUESTING THE FIRST THING WE WOULD DO IS- IDENTIFY THE STATE AGENCIES AND IN PARTICULAR THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AS WELL AS PARTNER JUSTICE. TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION THEY COLLECT AND MAINTAIN ABOUT HATE GROUPS AND THE MEMBERSHIP IN THOSE HATE GROUPS. OUT WE WOULD ALSO LOOK AT THAT PROCESS IS THAT THOSE AGENCIES PARTICULARLY- YES IN THE O. J. USED TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH EITHER THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL. OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PURPOSES- IN ADDITION WE WOULD LOOK AT A PEACE OFFICER. STANDARDS AND TRAINING AND WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE THIS POST PROVIDE TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE NCC ARE RELATED TO. SCREENING INDIVIDUALS DURING THE RECRUITING PROCESS THE HIRING PROCESS AND CERTAINLY DURING ONGOING EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION MISTER NAZARIAN AND OTHERS ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING ARE THERE ANY LEGAL IMPEDIMENTS. THAT WOULD LIMIT OR PREVENT YOU SEE OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING THIS INFORMATION WHEN MAKING EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS. ARE SO THAT IS A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE WOULD DO AT THE STATE LEVEL. THEN MISTER NAZARIAN AND OTHERS ABOUT SYSTEM SELECT. FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND DO A VARIETY OF THINGS LOOKING AT PROCESSES. EVALUATE THE PROCESS FOR SCREENING APPLICANTS COLLECTING INFORMATION MAKING HIRING DECISIONS MONITORING INDIVIDUALS AFTER THEY'VE BEEN HIRED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY DEVELOP ASSOCIATIONS WITH HATE GROUPS. AND THEN WHATEVER YOU LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES- ENGAGING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HIRING PEACE OFFICERS ARE THAT REFLECT THE AGENCIES RESPECTIVE COMMUNITY DO THEY HAVE A DIVERSE WORK FORCE. IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITY ACCESS. YOU KNOW THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LEVEL. AND THEN IT GOES SAY FOR INSTANCE THAT WE THOSE FOR LOW AND FORCE AGENTS. WHAT KIND OF PRICE. SUCH AS TRAINING FOR PEACE OFFICER- EMPLOYING THE TYPES OF TRAINING EDUCATING OFFICERS ABOUT BIAS AND PREJUDICE PREJUDICIAL STATEMENTS QUIETEST. ACTIONS AND WHAT DO THEY DO TO PROMOTE A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE AT THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENCY. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE IS REALLY LOOKING AT. AGAIN THE FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN THE EXTENT WE CAN POSSIBLY DO THIS TO IDENTIFY FINANCED OR PREJUDICIAL STATEMENTS POSTINGS ACTIONS BY POLICE OFFICERS EMPLOYEES OF THOSE AGENCIES. PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT IF THEY'RE OPEN COMPLAINTS. FILED AGAINST THOSE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS AND I LOOK AT TRYING TO IDENTIFY PASSED THE CURRENT MEMBERSHIP. IN ASSOCIATIONS OF DISSIPATION AND KNOWN HATE GROUP TO THE EXTENT WE WILL DO THAT TO THE EXTENT WE POSSIBLY CAN- BUT CERTAINLY LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE PROCESSES RELATED TO COLLECTING INFORMATION. USING THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE HIRING DECISIONS AND CERTAINLY HAVING AN ONGOING PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF THOSE AGENCIES ARE AWARE. IF IN THE EVENT INDIVIDUAL ASSOCIATES THEMSELVES WITH A HATE GROUP THAT THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS AWARE OF THAT- RELATIVELY. LARGE OUT OF THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED HOURS THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE'VE GOT TO GO TO. A COUPLE AT LEAST TWO OR THREE STATE AGENCIES WE'VE GOT TO GO TO THE FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES- TRADITIONAL AUDIT TEAM THAT WOULD TAKE US ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS BUT THIS IS ONE THAT I BELIEVE WE CAN. LEVERAGE OUR RESOURCES AND ESSENTIALLY HAVE A COUPLE OF WHAT IT USED TO REDUCE THE CHRONOLOGICAL TIME IT WOULD TAKE US TO CONDUCT THE AUDIT SO FOR EXAMPLE. WE WOULD HAVE THE TEAM GO OUT TOGETHER TO PERHAPS ONE OR TWO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THEN FOR THE SUBSEQUENT TO SPLIT UP AND GET THOSE TWO GONE DURING THE SAME WEEK SO. WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE- THE CHRONOLOGICAL TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS AUDIT. DONE AND GET THE INFORMATION TIME REALLY BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. WITHOUT MISTER CHAIR ALTERNATE BACK HERE. THANK YOU OUT OF ALL OF THE TIME WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND TO THE EFFECT AGENCIES AND AS A Q. THEM UP- LET ME ASK A PLEASE PER SE. IN THEIR COMMENTS AS WE HAVE A LONG AGENDA BEFORE US- WITH THAT LET'S MOVE TO THE OPERATOR AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE- SEVERAL FOLKS AFFECTED AGENCIES FROM CDC ARE POSTED PART ONE OF JUSTICE NO YES ON THE LINE WITH US SO LET'S GO TO BEGIN WITH THIS SARAH LARSON FROM CDC ARE.

ALL RIGHT HEARING AND SEEING NINE. WELL MR VOEPEL PLEASE PROCEED. SO THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL ARE NOT BILL BUT REQUEST. IS A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE BUT I MUST. RISE IN OPPOSITION AND RECOMMEND THAT WE NOT DO THIS AUDIT AND I HAVE. FOUR AND A HALF MAIN REASONS NUMBER ONE. IS HATE GROUPS ARE NOT DEFINED AND HATE GROUPS IN MY EXPERIENCE IN MY OPINION ARE VERY TRICKY LET ME START OUT WITH BLACK LIVES MATTERS. I BELIEVE THE BLACK LIVES MATTER CORE GROUP. ARE GOOD CITIZENS THAT ARE. DEFENDED AFRICAN AMERICANS OKAY BUT- THEY HAVE FRINGE GROUPS THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN VIOLENCE AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS AS PERCEIVED BY MAY. SOME SOUL BLM BASICALLY GOOD HAS BAD PEOPLE AFFILIATED NOW LET ME GO ON THE OTHER SIDE. TO PROMISE KEEPERS M. AS KEEPERS STARTED OUT AS A CHRISTIAN GROUP OF MAINLY MEN THAT WERE KEEPING THEIR PROMISES TO THEIR WIVES CHILDREN TO CHURCH EXCEPT FOR NOW OF COURSE PROMISE KEEPERS HAVE THEIR FRINGE GROUP. SO HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY DEFINE A HATE GROUP. THE REAL TRICKY PART OF THIS REQUEST. ALSO IT INCLUDES SPEECH AS WELL AS HATE GROUP AFFILIATIONS. SO. THE WAY I READ THIS. IF I SAID SOMETHING THIRTY YEARS AGO ON A TAX OR AN EMAIL OR WAS RECORDED OR WHATEVER IT COULD BE HELD AGAINST ME. EVEN IF I WAS DRUNKARD'S STUPID. YOU NEVER KNOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET ONLINE DRUNKEN STUPID AND SAY DUMB THINGS. CAN THAT BE HELD AGAINST THEM. MAYBE MAYBE NOT. HEY GROUP AFFILIATION- WHAT IF YOU WERE AFFILIATED WITH A HATE GROUP AND THEN LEFT THE HATE GROUP WHO. SO THAT GOES ON YOUR RECORD SEE. TODAY WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY. ANYTHING YOU DO IS RECORDED. EVERYTHING YOU SAY ANY EMAIL AND A TEXT CAN BE DREDGED UP I MEAN IF SOMEBODY GETS A DIVORCE THE FIRST PLACE. THE DIVORCE ATTORNEYS GO TO IS FACEBOOK. WELL PEOPLE ARE DRUNK AND STUPID ON FACEBOOK. M. TATTOOS SO WHAT IF I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I GET A HATE TED TO. AND THEN CHANGE MY MIND. NO LONGER A HATER. DOES THAT COUNT AGAINST YOU FOREVER DON'T KNOW. IN WHAT BOTHERS ME HERE ALSO IS. CAN ONLY POLITICALLY THAT TO. POLICE OFFICERS APPLY FOR A JOB OR CONTINUE TO SERVE. IF THEY'RE NOT CONVICTED CORRECTLY AND WHO DOES THE VETTING. NOW I GREATLY TRUST OUR CALIFORNIA'S STATE AUDITOR TRUST ME. SHE IS THE BEST AND HER WHOLE GROUP HER WHOLE CREW. I HAVE ABSOLUTE FAITH IN SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT PART OF IT BUT- WHAT I AM WORRIED ABOUT IS THE CRITERIA FOR THE AUDIT. AND THEN THE LAST THING THAT I'LL THROW IN. IS SIMPLY FORGIVENESS. DOES AN AUDIT LIKE THIS FORGIVE PAST BEHAVIOR AND HOW IS THAT FIGURES OUT. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN POLITICS. THANK YOU MR VOEPEL FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND LET ME FIRST BEGIN BY THANKING MISTER NAZARIAN WHO WORKED WITH US ON THE DEFINITION OF HATE- WHICH WE'VE NARROWED TO IT WERE A HATE GROUP SAP WE USE THE F. B. I.'S DEFINITION THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION WHICH STATES I HATE GROUPS PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO PROMOTE ANIMOSITY HOSTILITY AND MALICE AGAINST PERSONS. BELONGING TO A RACE RELIGION DISABILITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR ETHNICITY NATIONAL ORIGIN WHICH DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND WHAT THAT ARE GOING TO TURN INTO MISTER NAZARIAN TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE OTHER POINTS OF MR VOEPEL BROTHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HAPPY TOO AND YOU YOU TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH THAT WAS GONNA BE MY FIRST RESPONSE OF FIRST OF ALL% THE FEELINGS ARE MUTUAL MISTER VOEPEL I VERY MUCH RESPECT AND APPRECIATE YOU. I ALWAYS COUNT ON YOUR ADVICE AS MY VICE CHAIR IN AGING SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THESE POINTS AS WELL. IN FACT I WAS GOING TO PUT IT INTO THREE CATEGORIES THE FIRST ONE MISTER CHARITY ANSWERED SO I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THAT. THE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS- THINGS FROM PAST CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU WHAT IF THE IN TWO WHAT IF THE INDIVIDUAL LEFT THE GROUP. THAT THEY HAD JOINT OKAY AND THEN THREE TATTOOS WHAT IF IT WAS DONE IN THE YOUTH I'M PARAPHRASING BUT I THINK I CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF IT. I'LL BE VERY CANDID WITH YOU- I AND I GUESS THE SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE OF FORGIVENESS. MY GOAL. ISN'T AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE OF US WHO. ARE WANTING TO LOOK INTO. THE THIS BIT THE UNDERLYING ISSUE NOT JUST THE SYMPTOMS BUT THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF WHAT'S WRONG. ARE NOT GOING TO WORRY ABOUT THESE ISOLATED INCIDENTS MY GOAL IS. WHEN CERTAIN ISSUES ARE NOT ADDRESSED. THEY START FOSTERING A CULTURE OF THEIR OWN. WHEN WE HAVE A CULTURE WITHIN A DEPARTMENT THAT'S DANGEROUS THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE ROOTED OUT BECAUSE THAT'S A CANCER. WE DON'T WANT THAT CANCER TO BE MALIGNANT AND SPREAD AND CONTINUED TO DEVASTATE OTHER FUNCTIONS. I CAN SHARE WITH YOU MY OWN EXPERIENCE I'VE BEEN A VERY LONG TIME RESIDENT OF LA CITY. HAVE HARDLY GOTTEN PULLED OVER IN THE CITY OF LA BUT WHEN I GO TO A NEIGHBORING CITY. I KEPT I KEPT ON GETTING PULLED OVER I EVEN GOT PULLED OVER AS A STAFFER WITH EMPTY PLATE. THERE IS BIAS. AND I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT MYSELF BY THE WAY THAT OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS NOT PART OF THIS AUDIT BECAUSE I'M NOT A **** FOR TAT GUY I'M NOT TRYING TO GO AFTER SOMEONE FROM MY PAST THAT'S DONE SOMETHING MY GOAL. IS TO ROOT OUT. THE CANCER THAT TAKES HOLD AND BECOMES A CULTURE ONCE AND WE'VE HAD THAT HAPPEN SO OFTEN AND IT'S GONE ON UNCHECKED FOR SO LONG THAT NOW WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE INCIDENTS AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENS IS. INCIDENTS THAT RIGHTFULLY TAKE PLACE CAUGHT ON CAMERA GET BLURRED WITH INCIDENTS THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN PLACE AND IT BECOMES.

REGIONAL CENTERS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE AND I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR HARD WORKING STAFF MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR. THROUGH MY WORK IS CHAIR OF THE- ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I'VE HEARD FROM CALIFORNIANS AROUND THE STATE ABOUT VARIOUS AREAS OF CONCERN. INVOLVING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE LITTLE SERVICE. AND REGIONAL CENTERS. TO DATE I'VE HELD EIGHT SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS ACROSS THE STATE. SAN DIEGO COACHELLA FRESNO. CONCORD EUREKA SACRAMENTO RIVERSIDE AND READY. ADDITIONALLY HAVE MADE AN ONLINE SURVEY AVAILABLE ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE WITH THE PRIMARY GOAL. OF ASSESSING CLIENT AND CAREGIVER PARENT. EXPERIENCES WITH PROVIDERS AS WELL AS REGIONAL CENTERS. NEARLY SIX HUNDRED CONSUMERS HAVE COMPLETED THEM SELECT COMMITTEES ONLINE SURVEY DESCRIBING THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE DS IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS. I FOUND THAT THERE OF ARE THERE NOT OF NOT SERVICE PROVIDERS OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO HANDLE EXISTING CASELOADS AND REPEATED PROBLEMS A FULL TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN SERVICE COORDINATORS. AND THE CONSUMERS ON AVAILABLE SERVICES EITHER PROVIDED JUST TO NAME A FEW. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT I HAD. OCCURRENCE WITH WHO CAME TO ME SINGLE MOM WITH SEVERELY AUTISTIC YOUNG BOY. WHO WAS TOLD BY A SERVICE COORDINATOR THAT THEY COULD NOT. HAVE SERVICES PROVIDED BECAUSE SHE WAS SHE MADE TOO MUCH MONEY. SHE WAS DENIED SERVICES FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE OF THAT SERVICE COORDINATOR HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE SYSTEM AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT. THEY WERE DOING BASICALLY. BUT YET THAT THE YOUNG BOY LOST FIVE YEARS OF HIS LIFE OF HELP. THE MOTHER COULD NOT TAKE A SHOWER IN THE MORNING FOR FEAR THAT THE BOY WOULD HAVE DAMAGE HIMSELF OR THE- HOUSE. COULD NOT DRIVE TO SCHOOL WITHOUT BEING PUMMELED BY THAT YOUNG BOY. AT RISK OF OTHER DRIVERS TO. BECAUSE THE SERVICE COORDINATOR WAS A TRAINED WELL. AND AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO DISPOSE OF SERVICE CORNER BUT THERE IS A DESPERATE NEED. TO HAVE A LOOK AT HOW WE'RE DELIVERING SERVICES TO THIS COMMUNITY. THE REGIONAL CENTERS WERE DEVELOPED AND STARTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WE HAVE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS HAVE ID D. IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU JUST DO THE MATH AND YOU DO A QUESTIONS OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND. INDIVIDUALS PER REGIONAL CENTER. WE KNOW THERE'S A DESPERATE NEED. FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS WE'VE SAID THAT. ALSO IN DESPERATE NEED FOR EMPLOYEES OF THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE THE DIRECT SUPPORT. TO THE CONSUMER. WHAT I'M ASKING FOR AND YOU KNOW ALL THROUGH MY ROLE IN THE LAST NINE AND A HALF YEARS THAT AS BEING A CHAIRED IN DIFFERENT COMMITTEES I'VE HAD EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE STATE AUDITOR IN MY ROLE OF OVERSIGHT TO BE ABLE TO FOR MY JOB. WHEN I KNOW THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY IN THIS IS NOT TO DISPARAGE REGIONAL CENTERS OR DDS. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HOW WE ARE PROVIDING TO THE CONSUMER FROM THE CONSUMER BACK TO THE REGIONAL SERVICE HOW CAN WE DO A BETTER. WHAT ARE WE MISSING. WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT. BUT THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE AND I WOULD LOVE FOR US ALL TO COMBINE OUR OUR- OUR EFFORTS TO YOU KNOW WE JUST AS IT DID HISTORICALLY. FUNDING FOR THE IDT POPULATION THIS BUDGET. HISTORIC BUT YOU KNOW WHAT PLEASE OMIT THAT BROUGHT US UP TO. WHERE WE SHOULD BE. AS OF THREE YEARS AGO. THAT'S WHEN THE RACE STUDY WAS ACTUALLY COMPLETED. THIS ALSO GIVE US A WHAT KIND OF VALUE WE CAN GET FOR OUR MONEY. GOING FORWARD. LOOKING AT THE QUALITY OUTCOMES WHICH ARE IN THIS BUDGET METRICS OF OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE WHICH- GOD LOVE OUR DIRECTOR AND EDS NANCY BARGING HIS SHE IS ABSOLUTELY A GODSEND FOR THIS COMMUNITY. BUT SHE'S ONE PERSON. AND THERE'S THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE AS OUR ROLE. AS THE GUARDIANS FOR THIS POPULATION. THEY'RE BEING SERVED CORRECTLY AND APPROPRIATELY. AND I DO HAVE TO EXPERT WITNESSES MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO YOUR WITNESSES I BELIEVE WE HAVE- TRACY BUTLER THE PROGRAM COORDINATOR FOR THE STABILITY AND DEBBIE DAVIS OWNER AND DIRECTOR SPECIAL CARE SERVICES MY BELIEVE THEY'RE ON THE PHONE LINES WITH US. GOOD MOVE ADD TO THE PHONE LINES. AB MADAM OPERATOR. THEIR LINES ARE OPEN. PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS DEBBIE DAVIS AND I AM A REGISTERED NURSE IN A SMALL PROVIDER OF SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO ARE ALSO MEDICALLY FRAGILE IN THEIR HOME I'M ALSO THINKING OF THE FAMILY MEMBER OF A REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMER WITH COMPLEX NEEDS I SUPPORT THIS AUDIT AND I THINK IT IS CRUCIAL TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE THERE'S GAPS. AND BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM- AS WELL AS DISPARITIES IN ACCESSING THE SYSTEM AND THE THIRTY FIVE REGIONAL CENTER AND GEOGRAPHY SHOULDBE REALLY INCLUSIVE OF CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT IS PART OF THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT- OBJECTIVE IS TO INCLUDE THEM ON THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL FEEDBACK ON THE SERVICES AND SERVICE GAPS. WHAT DID THEY NEED THAT THEY DIDN'T GET- DUE TO YOUR LACK OF AUTHORIZATION OR LACK OF PROVIDERS. IN CERTAIN SERVICE AREAS. AND I THINK A LOT WITH THE THOUGHT OF THEIR WE WILL IMPORT FACTOR TO CONSIDER IN PLANNING- ESPECIALLY WITH THE TIMING- CODE NINETEEN S. HUGELY AFFECTED THE ENTIRE CD SYSTEM FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF- AND AT THIS POINT WE'RE STILL FAR FROM NORMAL- JUST. DEALING WITH ALL OF THE FALLOUT OF THAT. SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT- IF THE AUDIT IS DONE FAIRLY SOON THAT IT INCLUDED- THINGS WITH CODE NINETEEN WHAT WENT WELL WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL WHERE WERE THE CHALLENGES. WHAT COULD WE DO BETTER IN A SIMILAR SITUATION TO IMPROVE. OUR MAILBOX LOTS OF EMPLOYEES HILL UNEMPLOYMENT. AND YOU KNOW STARTING TO RECOVER NOW BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME- ALSO NUMBER TO THE AUDIT WOULD EVALUATE THE SYSTEM THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER DID MENTION THAT. FINANCIAL REPORT RATE STUDY WAS ALREADY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION UNDER FUNDED. BY THE RECENTLY AUTHORIZED ONE POINT YOU WILL THEN GET FIVE YEARS. WHAT GET UP TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FUNDING LEVELS AND THE TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN A GOOD START BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE IN THIS AREA. AND THEN AFTER THAT IT OUTLINES. THANK YOU. FOR YOU FOR COULD MOVE THIS BUT PLACE. HELLO MY NAME IS TRACY NOT AND I AM BALK AND I HAVE A AND A VENDOR- OF THE REGIONAL CENTER AS WELL AS A FAMILY MEMBER- I WANT TO- DEFINITELY SUPPORT THAT AUDIT FOR THE SYSTEM. I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN LACKING FOR MANY YEARS I'M LOOKING AT WORK OUR PROBLEMS ARE INSTEAD OF- DEALING WITH THEM BECAUSE OVERLOOKED- I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL AND FOLLOW THEM AND NOT START WITH THE RESULT THAT WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUALS AND FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE LACKING AND WHERE THEY ARE MAKING A SERVICES- I. YOU KNOW I'M LIKE IT'S A MUST MAN OF A- AND SHE DELIVER ME AND I COULD SEE HER CHAIR PROVIDERS. AND HAVE BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY. I HAD A HARD TIME NAVIGATING THE SYSTEM I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT ALL THE THINGS THAT SHE WAS- THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO HER WE'RE NOT EVER OFFERED IN MEETINGS. SO I HAD TO BRING THE START UP. AND THEN WHICH WILL ENSURE YOU CAN HAVE. THANK YOU. THERE IS SOMETHING THERE I'M NOT SURE IT'S JUST THE CASE MANAGEMENT HE'LL- PARTIAL TO SOME. VENDORS VERSUS OTHER VENDORS. SO I DO THINK THAT PACKAGE TO BE LOOKED AT- RESPONDING IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR US. AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HELP US GET THAT ONE. THANKS TO. BILLION DOLLARS THAT LIKE- IT MEANS THAT IT'S JUST START- I REALLY DO HOPE THAT THE TO HELP- LOOK AT ISSUE. WHAT'S REALLY ON WITH THAT OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. TODAY WITH A DENTIST- EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU THINK YOUR TESTIMONY. AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION. ADAM MONITOR PLEASE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF BOTH THE DEPARTMENT FELT NO SERVICES AND CERTAINLY GOING TO RATE A SELECTION OF REGIONAL CENTERS AND LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF ISSUES ARE REALLY AROUND THE PROCESS ACCESSIBILITY TO SERVICES THE QUALITY OF THOSE SERVICES THE TIMELINESS OF THOSE SERVICES BUT I'LL I'LL AT A HIGH LEVEL BILL THROUGH THE KEY OBJECTIVES AGAIN LOOKING AT TVS IN THEIR OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES. WHAT CASELOAD RATIOS HAVE THEY ESTABLISHED HOW DO THEY MAKE SURE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE ARE COMPLYING WITH THOSE PARTICULAR RATIOS AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES WHETHER OR NOT THE S. IS PROVIDING TRAINING TO REGIONAL CENTERS TO INCLUDE STEPS TO ASSESS QUALITY OF SERVICES AND SIMMERS HI MELINDA SAID THOSE SERVICES- AND THEN THE EFFORTS DDS AND THE REGIONAL CENTER TO MAKE THE EDUCATE PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RECEIVING SERVICES THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER WITH A VPN SERVICE PROVIDERS VIA THE REGIONAL CENTER. WHETHER OR NOT DDS AND A SELECTION OF REGIONAL CENTERS ACTUALLY MONITORS VENDORS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE DEQUATE THAT THEY'RE COST EFFECTIVE AND THAT THEY NEED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONSUMER THE NEEDS OF THE CONSUMER IN ADDITION AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS- MEMBERS ASKING US TO SELECT SOME INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLANS OF FORCING CONSUMERS TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THE GOALS ESTABLISHED IN THAT I. P. T. WERE ACTUALLY MAX AS THEIR MAIN FOLLOW UP- TO DETERMINE WHETHER CONSUMERS ARE GETTING QUALITY SERVICES IF CERTAIN SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE WITHIN THAT REGION. WHAT EFFORTS DOES THE REGIONAL CENTER TAKE TO TRY TO SEEK THOSE SERVICES ELSEWHERE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES THAT CONSUMER ON ASKING US TO LOOK AT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHAT RESPONSIBILITIES DID BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT THE VARIOUS REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE DO THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE THEY DUPLICATED ABOUT OF DDS RESPONSIBILITIES BUT CERTAINLY LOOKING AT WHAT THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS ARE DOING- TO THE EXTENT CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE SERVICES. AVAILABLE EVALUATE THE REASONS WHY FIVE AND AGAIN LOOKING TO DETERMINE WHETHER NOT REGIONAL CENTER ARE LOOKING ELSEWHERE TO BE TO TRY TO GET. SERVICES THOSE IN. I'M WHETHER OR NOT- DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT CENTER HAVE DATA COLLECTION. IN PURSUIT. FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE METRICS LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE HOW LONG DID IT CONSUMER HAVE TO WAIT FOR ACCESS TO A PARTICULAR SERVICE ARE CONVENIENT WAS THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE- WHAT'S THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE PROVIDES A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT METRICS. pPROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR STAFF AND MANAGEMENT AT BOTH DEVELOPMENTS- DON'T KNOW SERVICES HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND REGIONAL CENTERS ARE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO DIRECT SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED AND REALLY LOOKING AT HERE THE QUALIFICATIONS ARE WE ENSURING THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WE- HIRE AND EMPLOY. ME AND COMPLY WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND THEN THE LAST COUPLE OF OUR OBJECTIVES WERE RELATED TO IT DDS DETERMINES THAT- A SERVICE PROVIDER'S NEGLIGENCE OR IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW. WHAT MECHANISM DO THEY USE TO COMMUNICATE. THAT INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS. ACTUALLY TO OTHER CENTRES ETCETERA SO IS THAT INFORMATION GETTING OUT THERE SO PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT THIS PARTICULAR SERVICE PROVIDER IS IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND SHOULD NOT BE ONE THAT. PERHAPS THE STATE OR THE REGIONAL CENTER SHOULD BE CONTINUING TO ENGAGE WEST AND THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE IS REALLY LOOKING AGAIN AT SOME METRICS SELECTION OF REGIONAL CENTERS ASSESSED CONSISTENCY. TIMELINESS OF INTAKE. PROVISION OF SERVICES IF AN INDIVIDUAL OR THEIR LEGAL GUARDIAN OR PARENT REQUEST A MODIFICATION OF THOSE SERVICES IS THAT HAPPENING HOW TIMELY IS THAT- NOTIFICATION TODAY YES OR OTHER REGIONAL CENTRES I WAS SPEAKING A MINUTE AGO. BUT ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST OFFENDERS DID WE DID A REGIONAL CENTER OR THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TAKEN ACTION AGAINST OFFENDERS WELL THAT BE COMMUNICATED. TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER REGIONAL CENTER COMMUNITY ESSENTIALLY- WHAT INFORMATION DOES OUR OTHER DUE TO REGIONAL CENTRES PROVIDE. REGARDING HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAIN THIS WOULD BE THROUGH CONSUMERS THEMSELVES BUT ALSO TO LEGAL GUARDIANS AND PARENTS- HOW DO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO FILE A COMPLAINT OR DISPUTE SERVICES OR THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES THAT. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS RECEDING THE LAST TWO ISSUES. DO THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS ARE THEY TRANSPARENT ABOUT THEIR DISCUSSIONS ARE THERE MEETING MINUTES POSTED PUBLICLY WHAT KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS OR DISCUSSIONS ARE THE BOARDS HAVING AND THEN THE FINAL AREAS COMPLYING WITH CERTAIN CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE. THERE ARE LAID OUT CLEARLY SPECIFICALLY IN THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE- SO THEY STARTED AGAIN IS RELATIVELY LARGE BECAUSE IT THERE A LOT OF OBJECTIVES THAT THEY WENT OVER WE WENT DOWN TO A SELECTION OF A REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENT SERVICES- THIS ONE MAY BE SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE OTHER ARTISTS WHERE WE HAVE THE TEAM GO OUT TOGETHER. BUT THEN SPLIT THE TEAM UP SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE CHRONOLOGICAL TIME. IT WOULD TAKE US TO CONDUCT THE AUDIT. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU WATER WATER PRESHEAF THAT LET'S MOVE TO THE AFFECTED. AGENCIES AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE ON THE LINE IN WITH US- THIS BRIAN WENT. AND MR. RAMOS NAY. WHO ARE WITH THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOP SERVICES- MADAM OPERATOR FOR COULD TURN TO THE LINES PLEASE. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE PROCEED. BRANDON GILL CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS. WE APPRECIATE THE INTEREST IN OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AT THIS IS A MAJOR FOCUS BOTH FOR DDS AND FOR REGIONAL CENTERS. IN FACT THE DEPARTMENT REORGANIZATION IN TWENTY NINETEEN WAS AIMED AT. ADDRESSING AREAS OF NEED FOR ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ARCADIA STAFF TO OUR COMMUNITY. THERE'S A STATUTES REGULATIONS REGIONAL CENTER CONTRACT THAT PROVIDES FOR EXTENSIVE DDS OVERSIGHT OF REGIONAL CENTERS IN MANY AREAS INCLUDING REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS TO INCLUDE FAMILY RETREATS OF CASE OF RATIOS ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES PERSONALITY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SALARIES. DANIEL REGIONAL CENTER INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL AUDIT AND BY ANY OLD PDF FISCAL AUDIT. CAN BE THE PREVIEWS THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE POLICIES AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS. IN THE AREA REGIONAL CENTER PERFORMANCE ANGLE OUTCOME BASED PERFORMANCE CONTRACTOR REQUIRED BY REGIONAL CENTERS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE NATIONAL COURT INDICATOR SURVEYS WHERE WE- REVIEW THAT DATA TO ASSESS HOW REGIONAL CENTERS ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL CONSTITUENTS AND REGIONAL CENTERS USE. THAT DATA WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. HIS PERFORMANCE ALSO LOOK AT THE OF INTAKE AND THAT STUFF AND IMPROVEMENT THE YOU NEEDED TO. AS WELL AS THE ANGLE SERVICES DATA TO SPIN SURE THEY WERE MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WITH REGARDS TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS- OUR STAFF ATTEND ALL REGIONAL CENTER BOARD MEETINGS- WE ALSO REVIEW AND WILL POOR COMPETITION. AND WE ALSO REVIEW CONFLICTED INTEREST STATEMENTS BY BOARD MEMBERS AND FOLLOW UP WITH CLIPBOARDS ON ISSUES THAT ARE. OBSERVED IN MEETINGS AND OTHERWISE. WITH REGARDS TO HELP YOU TAKE IN SERVICES OUR STAFF REVIEWS SPECIAL INCIDENT REPORTS THAT ARE SUBMITTED BY REGIONAL CENTERS. ON A DAILY BASIS AND FOLLOW UP AS NEEDED I WOULD FOLLOW UP AND CONSUMERS RIGHTS AND WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT AND REVIEW. FAIR HEARING REQUESTED DATA. THIRD FOR AUTO ISN'T TO A REGARDING THE FOLK AND- ITSELF AND BROUGHT AND NOT TARGETED WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR DDS AND RETAIL CENTERS. TO BEST ASSIST AND SUPPORT THE REQUEST WITHOUT CLARITY. ADDITIONALLY SOME ELEMENTS ARE NOT MANDATED REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT IN ALIGNMENT WITH STATUTES REGULATIONS OUR CONTRACT. FOR EXAMPLE IT SPEAKS TO REGIONAL CENTER BOARD COMPENSATE BOARD MEMBER COMPENSATION WHERE AS BOARD MEMBERS ARE UNPAID VOLUNTEERS- THE STAKES OF BOARD MEMBER CONTACT INFORMATION WHILE ALL BOARDS HAVE A WAY TO CONTACT THE BOARD. THROUGH AN EMAIL ADDRESS OR OTHERWISE. WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE EMAIL ADDRESSES FOR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. CONTACT INFORMATION. AT THE REQUEST AFTER TVS TRACKS SERVICE PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FOUND TO BE NEGLIGENT OR VIOLATION OF LAW. THIS IS NOT A DDS FUNCTION AND NO DEFINITION IS GIVEN FOR NEGLIGENT AND SINCE SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST COMPLY WITH NUMEROUS LAWS THERE'S NO FOCUSED. WHICH ON WHICH. LAWS WOULD BE PERTINENT TO THE AUDIT. SEVERAL OF THE OTTER DIED WITH A T. TO BE ON. IN THE IN PROGRAM PLAN PROCESS WHERE DECISIONS ARE MADE REGARDING THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF SERVICES THAT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED. PRESS DDS DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. FOR EXAMPLE SERVICES BETTER UNAVAILABLE AND I REGIONAL CENTER CATCHMENT AREA DETERMINING WHETHER DDS TOOK ACTION TO SEEK OUT THE SERVICE WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING TO THE CONSUMER. I'M ENSURING THAT BENDER SERVICES ARE ADEQUATE AND COSTEFFECTIVE WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR DDS TO DO BUT THAT BEING PART OF THAT PLAN EIGHTEEN WHICH IS NOT CONSISTENT STATUTE. AND DETERMINING WHETHER DDS TAKES STEPS TO PROMOTE THE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES FROM VENDORS. AGAIN NOT A GOLD EDS- TAKES. PORTANTINO S. AS IN THE PREVIOUS OF NOTED TO FIFTY. THAT THE PARK TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUDGET BILLS HIRED INITIAL OF CHANGE AND REPRESENTS TRANSFORMATION OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM. EXAMPLES OF THIS REFORM INCLUDE IMPLEMENTATION OF RATE MODELS TO INCREASE PROVIDER RATE. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS PRIORITIZE HIS SERVICE COORDINATOR POSITIONS AND ASSOCIATED DEVELOPMENT OF PERSON CENTRED OUTCOMES. EACH OF THESE INITIATIVES ARE ANCHORED WITH A NEW INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM. ALL THE DANCE FROM A COMPLIANCE BASED SYSTEM TO ADOPT BASED SYSTEM. FIGURE PLEASE RAPIDLY. ITEMS FOR DISCUSS. I SORRY IF YOU COULD PLEASE RAPPER. WE APPRECIATE THAT YES GET THE AUDIT MOVES FORWARD THE SCOPE WOULD BE WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS GONNA BE REFINED WITH THE FOCUS BEING COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTES REGULATIONS AND CONTRACT AS WELL AS MEANINGFUL OUTCOMES. WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER IF THE DISCUSSION WOULD BE HELPFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. WAS- ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY.

HI THIS IS ERICA SHORE WHEN I'M COMMUNITY MEMBER OF THE ALABAMA LEE AND A MOTHER WITH A CHILD WITH DISABILITIES. WAS WAITED FOR ALMOST OVER A YEAR TO GET SERVICES TO REGIONAL CENTER AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE APPROVED THAT THE THOUGHT IT HAPPENED I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE TWELVE DIGIT. THANK YOU DAX- WITNESS PLEASE. AND MISTER MODERATED BY MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M SORRY I'M WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY ELSE THANK YOU. THANK ABOUT OPERATOR LET ME RETURN IT THE ITEM BACK TO MEMBERS HERE IN THE CHAMBER MAY ASK IF THERE ARE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MUSCLE RELATED PLEASE. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I'M AT AND A LOT OF US WORKED ON THE BUDGET THAT HAS JUST BEEN ADOPTED AND THAT. GENEROUS ONE POINT TWO BILLION. DOLLARS MORRIS WAS REFERENCED BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES. AND ALSO. HELP FOR SELF DETERMINATION PLANTS AND OTHER THINGS AND- AND IF YOU READ THE AUDIT THERE SOME THINGS THAT MIGHT BE ASCRIBED TO NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY. SO HOW DOES IT MIX WITH HOW YOU PREPARE THE AUDIT BEFORE WE DID THE BUDGET AND NOW THAT THERE'S MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR A BUNCH OF THESE THINGS HOW DO YOU THINK. THAT WILL UNFOLD IF WE WERE TO ADOPT THE AUDIT THE WAY IT'S REQUESTED. SHE HAD A QUESTION- WHICH- IN ALL HONESTY WHEN WE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS OF TRYING TO GET TO THIS POINT. FOR THIS AUDIT WE NEVER THOUGHT WE'D GET THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND YOU KNOW WE DO THE HARD WORK OF THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU FOR DOING SO AS IT WAS MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES THE IMPLEMENTATION ISN'T COMPLETE UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- YOU'RE GOING TO SEE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND AS YOU HEARD THE ONE WITNESS WHO HAS. HASN'T GOT ANY SERVICES FOR A YEAR AND STILL WAITING. THERE'S HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THAT ROLE. WE NEED JUST A UNBIASED SMOTHER SET OF EYES WHEN I WAS A BUILDING CONTRACTOR I ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE BUILDING INSPECTOR TO COME IN BECAUSE I WAS WALKING OVERSTAFFED HI MY NOT SEEN ANY SAVE ME TO DO A BETTER JOB. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR ANOTHER SET OF EYES. TO SAY. THAT WE ARE DOING IT RIGHT. WE CAN USE IMPROVEMENT OR WE'RE DOING THINGS. YOU DON'T REALLY DO NEED TO PROVIDE. BUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE RECEIVING THE SERVICES REALLY NEVER HAVE HAD A VOICE. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE CRUX OF THIS IS. ONE OF I'M OVER ME JUST ON MY OWN TIME COMMON APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT. THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM I WAS BUDGET CHAIR IN THIS CHAMBER FOR A MOD TWO THOUSAND FORTY EIGHT. AND A LOT OF THE- INSTITUTIONS WERE CLOSED DOWN AT THE TIME 80% OF THE MONEY. WANT 220% OF THE RECIPIENTS IN THE INSTITUTIONS AND- ARE 20% OF THE MONEY WENT LOCAL PROGRAMS AND YET. WHEN THE HOSPITALS WERE CLOSED DOWN THE SAVINGS FROM THE MONEY DIDN'T SHIFT TO THE LOCAL PROGRAMS. AND THE SO I THINK PART OF THIS IS. IT IS THE RESOURCES AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN ALLOCATED BUT- I'M ON THE GO WITH YOUR- SUGGESTION THAT ARE- WE HAVE THE INDEPENDENT EYES WE LOOK AT IT AND IF PART OF THE RECOMMENDATION IS MONEY. THEN IT WAS WE KNOW THAT THAT SAID OF PART OF IT IS THAT THE SERVICES COULD BE DELIVERED BETTER WITH THE EXISTING MONEY THEN WE WOULD GET AT THAT SO- THIS THE- THAT. THERE MIGHT BE SOME REDUNDANCIES IN HERE I THINK IT'S WORTH GOING AHEAD WITH WHAT PRESHEAF HAD ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE TO ADD CENTER IS. THE I. D. D. POPULATION GROWS BY 25% EVERY DECADE THERE'S NO COLON THAT. SO WE'LL LOOK INTO IN FIVE YEARS WILL HAVE A TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT. INCREASE IN POPULATION. BEING PAID THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. RIGHT THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE CHAMBER. HEARING AND SAYING NINE- WE ASK MISS FRAZIER IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. INVESTORS ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR STAYING THERE WITH ME. YOU STAY THERE BELIEVE IN ME. YOUR STAFF WAS WONDERFUL WORKING. MISTER LEONARD THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSTRAINT CONSIDERATION THIS IS SOMETHING ABOUT HUMANITY ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A VOICE AND ALL WE CARE ABOUT IS THAT THEY'RE BEING TREATED FAIRLY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR. ON BEHALF OF THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE SAN DIEGO DELEGATION THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT OUR REQUEST TO AUTHORIZE AN AUDIT OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. SAN DIEGO COUNTY FACES A CRISIS IN OUR JAIL SYSTEM. LOCAL ADVOCATES AND MEDIA HAVE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS AND LARGENUMBER OF SUICIDES AND OTHER DEATHS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES. THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE PUBLIC RECORD DOCUMENTING THE TRAGIC LOSS OF LIVES SYSTEMIC FAILURES AND INADEQUACIES OF OVERSIGHT. FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE DIED HAVE FILED NUMEROUS LAWSUITS ALLEGING THAT THE COUNTY AND JAIL STAFF ACTED WITH DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE TO AN INMATE'S SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH MEDICAL AND RELATED NEEDS. ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. FROM. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE SEVENTEEN INMATE SUICIDE DEATHS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY FAR OUTPACED OTHER LARGE CALIFORNIA COUNTY JAIL SYSTEMS. FOR EXAMPLE. THE ORANGE COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM HAD ONE SUICIDE AND THE RIVERSIDE AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM EACH HAD THREE SUICIDES DURING THE SAME THREE YEAR PERIOD. EVEN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM WHICH HAS AN INMATE POPULATION MORE THAN THREE TIMES LARGER THAN SAN DIEGO COUNTY JAIL POPULATION. AND A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS RELATED TO INADEQUATE SUICIDE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS HAD EIGHT SUICIDES DURING THIS THREE YEAR TIME PERIOD. LESS THAN HALF AS MANY AS SAN DIEGO COUNTY. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE SAN DIEGO UNION TRIBUNE INVESTIGATION. FOUND THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FORTY PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN COUNTY CUSTODY. MAKING SAN DIEGO COUNTY JAIL MORTALITY THE HIGHEST AMONG LARGE COUNTIES IN OUR STATE. WE KNOW THAT THIS CRISIS OF INMATES DYING BEHIND BARS IS NOT THE WORK OF ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL. THIS IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE THAT REQUIRES AN INDEPENDENT OBJECTIVE REVIEW SO THAT WE CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND HOW A JAIL SENTENCE IT BECAME A DE FACTO DEATH SENTENCE FOR MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THIS AUDIT IMPLEMENT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO PREVENT THIS FROM CONTINUING TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. WITH ME BY TELEPHONE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LIBERTY SANCHEZ FROM LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR SEIU CALIFORNIA AND PALOMA SERENA. WHOSE DAUGHTER UNFORTUNATELY DIED IN CUSTODY AT THE LOS COLINAS DETENTION AND RE ENTRY FACILITY AND NOVEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. THANK YOU.

I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE CONDITIONS IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY JAIL OVERSEEN AT THAT MINISTER BY THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. UNSAFE FOR DETAINEES AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS ALIKE. WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE STAFFING LEVELS AND LACK OF ADHERENCE TO GENERAL PRACTICE PROTOCOLS.

MY NUMBERS ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT DESPITE THEIR BEST OUT OF IT THEY SIMPLY CANNOT PROVIDE THE HIGH QUALITY LEVEL OF CARE DEMANDED BY THE HIGH RISK PATIENT POPULATION WHEN THEY ARE BETH OVERWORKED AND EXHAUSTED DUE TO INADEQUATE STAFFING. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL. APPROVE THE FATHER BUT BY. INSTRUCTIONS ASK THE ANSWER REGARD THE AND CONDITION AT THE SAME DIEGO CA JAIL. WE HOPE THAT THE PRINCIPLES AND ACCOUNTABILITY WILL BE TWO IMPORTANT CHANGES AT THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY JAIL TO WILL BETTER ENSURE AN ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF DETAINEES.

CENTREBOARD THIS IF I MAY IMPOSE A QUESTION OR TWO- THESE TWO TWO THROUGH THE CHAIR TO THE TO THE AUTHOR- AFTER CHATTING WITH HER MY COLLEAGUES IT APPEARS AS IF SAN DIEGO HAS A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF INMATE. DEATHS THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- AND I GUESS IT'S GOT WANTED TO POSE THE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. NORMALLY IF WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT WOULD ALMOST SEEM APPROPRIATE FOR US TO DO A STATEWIDE. OUR REVIEW OF THE INMATE DEATH. NUMBERS OF THE COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS AS OPPOSED TO JUST ONE PARTICULAR COUNTY. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR IDEAS ON. WHY THIS ONE IS SELECTED. ONLY AND NOT. WITHIN THE LARGER RUBRIC OF A STATE WIDE REVIEW. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION- THERE IS DATA OUT THERE ALREADY IN TERMS OF THE SUICIDE AND DEATH IN OTHER COUNTY THAT'S WHY WE KNOW THAT SAN DIEGO- HAS THE HIGHEST OF THE LARGEST COUNTY SO. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THIS AUDIT IS WHY RIGHT AND SO A PART OF THE AUDIT IS ALSO GOING TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NUMBERS THAT THEY GET. CORRELATE WITH THE NUMBERS THAT WE'VE SEEN BEFORE. BUT WE ALREADY KIND OF ALREADY KNOW THAT INFORMATION WE'RE JUST DIGGING DEEPER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT OUR SYSTEM. THAT WE HAVE MORE INMATES THAT HAVE DIED. SO THAT SERVICE IS NOT. EXTRAPOLATING OUT- HAVE SAN DIEGO IS DOING THINGS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA IT IS LIMITED ONLY TO HELP SAN DIEGO IS DOING THINGS THAT ALLOWS FOR THE DESPAIR AT NUMBERS THAT WE'RE SEEING OUT OF THAT COUNTY EXACTLY SO WE'RE LOOKING AT POLICIES PROCEDURES- STAFFING. LOOKING AT IT FROM OF A HOLISTIC STANDPOINT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ISSUE IS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST ONE THING IT IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE THAT WE HAVEN'T SO LOOKING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS TO THE WE CAN FIX IT THIS IS CLARIFICATION THE AUDITOR IS BEING DIRECTED THROUGH THIS REQUEST. BUT TO ALSO GIVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF PUT A GOOD AMOUNT OF EFFORT INTO HOW SAN DIEGO FITS INTO THE WHOLE OF THE CALIFORNIA- APPEAL EXPERIENCE EXACTLY SO WHEN THE AUDITOR- DISCUSSED IT SHE SAID THAT SHE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY ARE GOING TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK TO SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND COMPARED TO BEST STANDARDS AND BEST PRACTICES. THANK YOU. I THANK SEVERAL ASKED THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR VOEPEL PLEASE. SO I SUPPORT THIS AUDIT. FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS- WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A PROBLEM IN SAN DIEGO AND I BELIEVE THROUGH MY CONTACTS WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THAT THEY WELCOME THE AUDIT. AND I WORKED WITH THE OTHER DOCTOR WEBER FOR A YEAR BEFORE AND YOU CAN CONFIRM IT WITH HER OR GOOGLE IT. ON THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT. SO I DO HAVE- HURT FEELING THOUGH. I HURT FEELINGS. SO HE SAID THIS WAS SUPPORTED BY THE DEMOCRATIC SAN DIEGO. GROUP WHICH I CONSIDER MYSELF EVEN AS A REPUBLICAN TO BE PART OF THE SAN DIEGO DELEGATION. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MIGHT OCEANSIDE COLLEAGUES. AND WE HAVE ANOTHER REPUBLICAN KINDA UP NORTH SO. IF YOU COULD IN THE FUTURE AS A PERSONAL REQUEST JUST. FIGURE THAT THE SAN DIEGO DELEGATION WHICH OF MY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH. IN A CORD ON MOST THINGS. SO THAT SAID THANK YOU MR VOEPEL. AND WITHOUT WILL BE ASKED THERE'S ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HEARING AND SEEING NINE LET ME ASK- THIS LEVER IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE YES I WOULD I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL AND DON'T MEAN TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS- AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THE OVERSIGHT THE WAY THIS CAME ABOUT WAS- A RESOLUTION I CAME THROUGH THE SENATE GO DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE GOT ALL OF THE DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES TO SIGN ON- INCLUDING THE SENATOR SELL. IN THE FUTURE WE WILL DEFINITELY MAKE SURE TO REACH OUT TO YOU AND OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES- TO SIGN ON TO THIS BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT YOU IN IT EVEN THOUGH I KNOW YOU SUPPORTED IT- BECAUSE YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN SIGN A LETTER BUT IN THE FUTURE WE DEFINITELY WELL. I'M SO IT IS SAID. THAT A TRUE MEASURE OF ANY SOCIETY CAN BE FOUND IN HOW IT TREATS ITS MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS. AND BY THAT STANDARD IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE ARE FAILING. A JAIL SENTENCE SHOULD NOT BE A DE FACTO DEATH SENTENCE. WE MUST DO BETTER AND WE CAN DO BETTER. BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE MUST FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND FIX IT. AGAIN THIS IS CLEARLY A LONGSTANDING SYSTEMIC ISSUE THAT REQUIRES AN INDEPENDENT OBJECTIVE REVIEW. ON BEHALF OF OUR DELEGATION I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. WHAT WE WILL HAVE IS A FIFTEEN YEAR REPRESETATIVE SAMPLE THAT WILL GIVE US THE DATA THAT WE NEED TO FIX THE PROBLEM THAT WE CLEARLY HAVE WITHIN OUR JAIL SYSTEM. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK REST WEBER WOOD PROCEDURE BRING THIS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT'S PROTOCOLS AND POLICIES FOR ENSURING SAFETY OF THE INMATES WE KNOW THAT. SAN DIEGO HAS HAD AN ISSUE AND IT'S COUNTY JAILS AND WITH THAT I DO HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION AND I'M ASKING I BELIEVE IT WAS MOVED BY SENATOR LEYVA AND SECONDED BY MISS BERNARD ABOUT. MADAM SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. IN SALINAS ON. THE MOTION IS TO APPROVE AUDIT REQUEST TWENTY TWENTY ONE DASH ONE OH NINE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS HI SALAS I BOERNER HORVATH. BOERNER HORVATH I HIGHLY. PATTERSON RUBIO. VOEPEL VOEPEL I WOULD WOOD I SENATOR LAYERED. LAYERED I BACKER. GORGEOUS FOR JUST AYE GLAZER. HERTZBERG LEYVA LEYVA AYE NIELSEN NIELSEN HI. THE MOTION CARRIES WALDO WELL THE ROLE OPENED FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THANK THANK YOU MISS WEBER THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO FILE ITEM NUMBER. SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE DASH ONE FOURTEEN STATE AGENCIES MANAGEMENT OF SURPLUS PROPERTY WHEN YOU'RE READY TO PROCEED PLEASE PROCEED TO. ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUICK SILVA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM HERE TO PRESENT TO MY AUDIT REQUEST REGARDING STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES UP FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND IS COMMITTEE AND- FOR THEIR VERY DILIGENT WORK ON THIS MATTER. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC OUR STATE WAS FACING THE WORST HOUSING SHORTAGE WITH THE GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE PAST YEAR THESE ISSUES. HAVE ONLY GOTTEN WORSE AS A RESULT OF MANY CALIFORNIANS LOSING THEIR JOBS AND BECOMING HOUSING AND SECURE. WE'VE MADE MANY STEPS AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO ADDRESS THIS WITH A RECENT VOTE ON A RED MORATORIUM. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED TODAY IN THIS AUDIT INTERSECT AS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM FRAZIER'S AUDIT REQUEST FOR THE I. D. D. POPULATION. WE ALSO KNOW LOOKING IN THE FUTURE WITH THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT POTENTIALLY WILL MOVE FROM BEING HOUSED TO HOMELESS ARE TOO MANY TO COUNT. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT STATE PROPERTY STATE SURPLUS PROPERTY BUT WE HAVE SEEN AND EVAN FLOW JUST IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN I SAT ON ACCOUNTABILITY. COMMITTEE WE ARE ACTUALLY JUST REMOVING PART PROPERTIES FROM THE ROLES NOW WE FIND OURSELVES. IN A CRISIS AND EVERY PIECE OF LAND IS VALUABLE WE KNOW HOUSING PRICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF HEALTH CALIFORNIA ARE THE HIGHEST THEY'VE EVER BEEN. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT SURPLUS PROPERTY IT'S OUR DUTY TO NOT ONLY TAKE INVENTORY BUT TO AUDIT IT TO FIND OUT WHY WHEN CALIFORNIANS. THE ONE THING THEY DO AGREE ON. AND IS VERY CONTESTED PERIOD IS THAT WERE NOT DOING ENOUGH REGARDING HOMELESSNESS. THAT WE ARE NOT. HOUSING PEOPLE THAT WE ARE NOT BUILDING. AND THAT WE ARE FAILING WITH SOME OF OUR PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. SO WITH THAT WE HAVE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS 27% OF CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS POPULATION IS CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. JUST IN MY COUNTY OF ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE BETWEEN THIRTY TO FORTY DEATHS A MONTH OF PEOPLE DYING AND PUBLIC. SPACES BENCHES BUS STOPS PARKS THEREFORE IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE STATE IDENTIFY AND SELL SURPLUS PROPERTIES TO PURSUE SUSTAINABLE INNOVATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS IN TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. IN WHICH HE ORDERED THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF. HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES FOR COST EFFECTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. THEN CAME COATED IN THE PANDEMIC. AND AS YOU MIGHT GUESS WE HAVE SEEN VERY VERY VERY LITTLE. HOUSING THAT HAS NOW HAPPENED ON SURPLUS PROPERTY STATE PROPERTY. NOW THE STATE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED OVER FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PARCELS. NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE SUITABLE FOR HOUSING. BUT WE KNOW A MINUTE AMOUNT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN USED OR ARE GOING TO BE USED FOR FUTURE HOUSING IT IS MY HOPE THAT WITH THIS AUDIT WE WILL BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES DGS ALLOWS WHEN DISPOSING STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES. I BELIEVE IT ALL WHAT ALSO BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS FOLLOWED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WHEN DISPOSING TRANSFERRING AND SELLING OF STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES. COLLEAGUES WE HAVE SOME PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT ONLY A FEW ACRES BUT HUNDREDS OF ACRES THAT ARE NOT BEING USED RIGHT NOW. SOME OF THOSE PROPERTIES ARE FORMER HOSPITALS FOR OUR DISABLED. COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WERE CLOSED DOWN SOME OF THOSE PROPERTIES ARE SITTING IDLE WITH SOME BUT IN SOME CASES HUNDREDS OF ROOMS. THAT USED TO BE SERVE OUR FORMALLY DISABLED POPULATION. IN SAN FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO FRESNO LOS ANGELES ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO HAVE ALL SEEN GREAT. INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS AND SO IT IS MY **** THAT WE AUDIT OUR SURPLUS STATE PROPERTIES AND MAKE THE ENQUIRING TO FIND OUT WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FOR SEE IN THE FUTURE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HERE TO SPEAK WITH ME OR WITH YOU- IS IN THIS AUDIT IS HEATHER HEATHER STRATMAN THE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING FOR HEALTH ORANGE COUNTY. RIGHT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN WILL GO AHEAD AND TURN TO YOUR WITH THIS WE BELIEVE IS ON THE PHONE LINES THIS IS MATT MISS HEATHER STRATMAN DIRECTOR OF HOUSING FOR HEALTH ORANGE COUNTY. AT GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND MY NAME IS HEATHER STRATMAN NINETY SERVICE THE DIRECTOR FOR HOUSING FOR HELP ORANGE COUNTY. AT A WIDE KNOWN AS A TEACHER C. H. A THEME WITH FORMED TO IMPLEMENT AN ONLINE FINDING SUPPORT ORANGE COUNTY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED UNIT PLANTS DELIVER NEW AFFORDABLE AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TO OUR REGION. IT OUR CHALLENGE IS CLEAR WE DO NOT HAVE THE AVAILABLE LAND OR THE INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT SUPPORT THE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED UNIT PLAN. BUT LAND VALUES AT ALL HIGH ALL TIME RECORD HIGHS LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF. REAL ESTATE. AND A VERY COMPLEX AND TIME CONSUMING PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE CAPITAL FACT IT TO FINANCE AFFORDABLE AND PSH PROJECT. WE ARE SORELY LACKING IN BOTH THE SCALING CAPACITY TO HOW THE THOUSANDS OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA COUNTY AND SUPPORT THE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS. AND FAMILIES SEARCHING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND TWENTY NINETEEN AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- INDICATED THE STATE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL THOUSAND STATE ON SITE THAT WERE DEEMED SURPLUS PROPERTY. BUT IN FACT TIENEN WITH CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESOURCES THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY DIRECT ACTION MOVIE TYPE. FROM BAKING OR UNDER UTILIZED PROPERTIES TO BIBLE HOUSING PROJECT. MANY OF THE CHALLENGES I'VE ENCOUNTERED INCLUDE THE LACK OF A PREEMPTIVE ZONING PROCESS AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ENTITLE AND CONVEYED PROPERTY TO THE LOCAL ENTITY. A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL AT BOTH THE STATE LEVEL AND LOCALLY TO COMBAT THE NAME THE EFFORT. AND A DIVERGENT IDEOLOGY BETWEEN LABOR GROUP IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS BACK IN IN THE FAMILY VERILY LIMITING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK BEING BROUGHT TO THE MARKET. UNDER CURRENT STATE LAW- AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE A PARTY AFTER SURPLUS MIGHT. I RECOMMEND YOU MOVE THE PROPERTY TO THAT LIST OF THE DAY ARE READY FOR TRANSACTION. SECOND I RECOMMEND THAT THEY BE CONVEYED WITH BY RIGHT DESIGNATION IF THEY ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. THIS WILL PUT THE PARCEL INFLATE. AND CIRCUMVENT YOU CAN BE OBJECTION. IT OF THE OF. YOU NEEDED STATEWIDE. ANY AVAILABLE STATE FEDERAL HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS COMING INTO THE PIPELINE NOW IS THE TIME TO AT IT IT HAS STARTED OUT IT IN RELEASED THE SURPLUS PROPERTY MARKET THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME LEADERSHIP ON THE SOCIAL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION MADAM AUDITOR. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK SILVA INDICATED WAS REALLY LOOKING AT MANAGEMENT OF SURPLUS PROPERTIES IN CALIFORNIA FIRST OF ALL- WORKING WITH A PARTICULAR AGENCIES CALTRANS TGS DEPARTMENT FELDMAN SERVICES OUR HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. ARGUMENT TO IDENTIFY PROCESSES THEY USED TO IDENTIFYING REPORT SURPLUS PROPERTIES- WITH RESPECT TO THE FORTY FOUR THOUSAND- PARCELS THAT- IS BURKE SOLD AND I REFERRED TO YOU- LOOKING AT THE STATUS OF THOSE HOW MANY OF THOSE HAVE BEEN DEEMED SUITABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- WHAT'S THE PROGRESS AND TIMELINE OF ANY HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT I HAVE COMMENCED ON THOSE ON THOSE PARCELS IF THEY HAVE BEEN DEEMED NOT SUITABLE FOR HOUSING WHY IS THAT- TO TRY TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WHICH ONES WITHIN THAT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND AND THEN ANOTHER STEP. BEYOND THOSE FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DETERMINE WHAT THE STATE OWNS ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES- THAT IT IDENTIFIED IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT MAY BE SUITABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH A SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON THE COUNTIES- MISS CORK SILVA. I POINTED OUT IN HER COMMENTS THAT WOULD BE FRESNO LA ORANGE SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO AND SAN FRANCISCO I PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOSE COUNTY STEPS HAVE SEEN IT I'M- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO LOOKING AT THE A SELECTION OF PARCELS THAT WERE DEEMED SUITABLE FOR HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHAT STEPS NEED TO BE CARRIED OUT- TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO BUILD COST EFFECTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. ACTUALLY HAPPENS- SHE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT PROCESS ON ONE'S INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS IN IDENTIFYING PROPERTIES AND TRANSFERRING OR GETTING THOSE PROPERTIES IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS- IDENTIFY THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE ACTIVE. PLANS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND CONTRARY TO THAT- PROPERTIES DO NOTHAVE AN PLAN. DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEPART ARE WORKING TO OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLES THAT MAY BE IN A WAY I'M DEEMING THAT PROPERTY SUITABLE FOR HOUSING AND GETTING SOME PLANS ARE IN PLACE. AND THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE IS EVALUATING THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AGENCIES CALTRANS AGAIN D. A. D. S. I GENERAL SERVICES AND HEALTHCARE SERVICE I'M- HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS- WITH RESPECT TO TRANSPARENCY ENGAGING WITH THESE LOCALS TO. IDENTIFY AND WORK WITH THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILT IN CALIFORNIA- ALSO IDENTIFYING THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. WE SHOULD ENSURING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACTUALLY DO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM SURPLUS PROPERTIES ONE OF THE WITNESSES TALKED ABOUT NAME BASED SO. REALLY LOOKING TO SEE AS WE SAW IN A PREVIOUS SITE WE DID ON A HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA AND- DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. ASKING US TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THE STATE IS DOING TO ENGAGE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT THIS TYPE OF HOUSING IS BUILT- WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED HOURS. NOT A VERY BIG AUDIT- TAKES ABOUT. SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE THANK YOU. THANK YOU BARAMATI WHAT THAT LET'S AHEAD AND TO- A PUBLIC COMMENT REMOVED A PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME WE SEE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE CHAMBER. HEARING AND SEEING NINE WILL BE MOVED TO THE- I'M SORRY LET ME MOVE TO. THE AFFECTED AGENCIES- FROM THE SAUDADES AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THEM ON THE PHONE LINE- WE HAVE MEMBERS FROM DG YES H. C. D. DDS HAVE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. SO LET ME ASK. OF MADAME OPERATOR IF WE HAVE MISTER MATT BENDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. OR MR JASON KENNEY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. YES MISTER CHAIR- MY NAME IS TAKING CAN YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY YES PLEASE PROCEED AT. THANK YOU UNDER THE DIRECTOR FOR REAL ESTATE THAT APARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENT AND CONTACT ON THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. ASSEMBLY MEMBERSMAY BE AWARE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF TESTIFYING LOCAL PARK BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE NOW ON THE SUBJECT EXECUTIVE ORDER IN FACT COUNTING OR LEGISLATIVE OUTREACH TO MEMBERS ON SITE YOU'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON IN THE DISTRICT- DEJECTED AND CONTACTED FIFTY Q. LEGISLATIVE OFFICES COMMITTEES AND CAUCUSES ACROSS SIXTY NINE INSTANCES. OF BRIEFINGS MEETING INCREASE OUTREACH AND HEARING- BY PREVIOUSLY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRED DGS AND HOW THEN CAN YOU DEVELOPMENT HCD TRIBUTE THE ENTIRETY OF STATE OWNED PROPERTY FOR POTENTIAL HOUSING SITES. AND IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST FACT THAT I SHOULD CORRECT THE RECORD ON THERE ARE NOT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACCESS OR SURPLUS PARCELS. FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PARCELS IS THE ENTIRETY OF STATE OWNED PROPERTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- CERTAINLY IF WE HAD FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACCESS PROPERTIES I WOULD ABSOLUTELY SHARE ASSEMBLY WOMAN CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS THING DONE- THE FACT IS TYPICALLY WE HAVE VERY FEW ACCESS THIS SURPLUS PROPERTY ON THE GOLD AND BOARDING TIME- GENERALLY LESS THAN FIFTEEN OR SO. AND THAT'S WHY GOVERNOR NEWSOM CALLED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF STATE PROPERTY- TO MAKE SURE THAT NO STONE WAS LEFT UNTURNED. SO IN TWENTY NINETEEN NINETEEN ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT REVIEWED ALL OF THOSE FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH A PROPERTY WE WERE PRIMARILY LOOKING FOR PROPERTY THAT EITHER- WAS POTENTIALLY SUITABLE FOR HOUSING AND- THAT APPEARED TO BE UNDER UTILIZED BY STATE DEPARTMENT. YOU CAN IMAGINE CALIFORNIA OWNS A LOT OF PROPERTY THAT IS EITHER CLEARLY ACTIVELY IN USE BY DEPARTMENT OR EXPLAIN ME UNSUITABLE FOR HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE NATURAL RESOURCES BUDGET SPEECHES LAKE PARK CETERA. FACTORING THOSE PARCELED OUT AND WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT TO FURTHER SCREEN OUT PROPERTY THAT WERE CONTAMINATED THE WORD HEIRONEOUS LEE AND COUNTY PROPERTY RECORDS BELONG TO THE STATE OR THAT HAD REASONABLY LIKELY FUTURE. STATE USED PLAN WE'VE. BEEN A FIVE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR PARCELS SUITABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THAT INCLUDES A MENTION THAT WERE TO GET THE A FIVE GOVERNMENTS AND BY MY- OF LEGISLATURE. WHICH WE THEN AN STILL ACT ENCOURAGE. THOSE ONE TWENTY SITE SEVENTY ACT. AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT- AFTER WE COMPILED A HUNDRED TWENTY FOURTH FLIGHT BEGAN PRIORITIZING THEM FOR DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS AN EDITOR TO PROCESS. WE USED PUBLISHED CRITERIA THAT ALIGN WITH ATVS FINANCING PROGRAMS AND WE GENERALLY LOOKED AFTER FOCUSED ON SITE THEY CAN BREAK GROUND MORE QUICKLY. AND BE MORE COMPETITIVE FOR FINANCING. INTERWEAVE ACCOMPLISHED I THINK WE'VE MADE SOLID PROGRESS GIVEN THAT WE UNDERTOOK THIS EFFORT WITH NO ADDITIONAL STAFFING RESOURCES. EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS A VERY SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT MODEL IN MIND. WHICH IS PROBABLY ANOTHER PLACE TO CORRECT THE RECORD ON. THE STATE DOES NOT SELL OR TRANSFER PROPERTIES UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER WE LEASED THEM TO DEVELOPERS TO BUILD MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THE HOUSING IS. THANK YOU DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH IS MISTER BENDER THERE WITH YOU AS WELL ARE YOU. TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF BOTH OF YOU. I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE OF US I I'M ALMOST AT THAT. HELPS NUMBER TWENTY NINETEEN WE SHOULD GO FIRST PLEASE- RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHICH I'M HAPPY TO SAY PROGRAM LAST MONTH. I THINK THAT WE GET RATED ON THE MOST EFFICIENT APPROACH ITSELF WITH ANNUAL GLOBAL FORTY TWELVE EIGHT TO TWELVE BY DEVELOPERS. AT PRESENT WE HAVE SIXTEEN PROJECTS IN BOMBAY DEVELOPMENT TEN ARE FULLY AWARDED IT I DON'T THINK THAT FOURTEEN HUNDRED UNITS OF HOUSING THE OTHER SIX DURING PUBLICATION. WELCOME BUDGETARY LANGUAGE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THAT WE EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO FELT LIKE TO MAXIMIZE HOUSING SOME OF OUR LARGER SITES HAVE BEEN DELAYED UNTIL WE COULD ADDRESS SHORTCOMINGS THAT ARE LEASING THE AUTHORITY. WHICH WILL INCREASE OUR PIPELINE OVER THE SUMMER- COMMITTEE AFTER TODAY WOULD REQUIRE IF YOU CONCERNED INCLUDING MR KENNEY WE APPRECIATE WE HAVE. THREE OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE TO TESTIFY AS WELL. OF COURSE OF COURSE. I TO BE COMPLETE BY. FOR PURPOSES YOU GET ME. THE AND ALL THAT WITH EVERY SINGLE. AND PART OF THE PROBE MINUTES. AFTER ABLE TO SEARCH AND MAP- IT OFF THE LIST EVERY PROJECT WE HAVE IN THE PIPELINE INCLUDING APPLICATION. THEY CAN TAKE THEIR TESTIMONY COMPILED BUT HEARING THAT THANK YOU AND THE CRITERIA I MENTIONED EARLIER- WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. OR CANNELLA QUICKSILVER INCLUDING UP ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT. THE YELLOW FOR OUR EFFORTS TO HELP. WE THANK YOU FOR YOU WANTING TO WORK WITH. AN WITH THE ON. ON THE SIDE LIMIT THIS TIME ONLY ASK IF THERE'RE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOP ON THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY. YES THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS FOR FASTER WITHOUT THE CAR AGAIN AND I'M UNIT CHIEF IN THE HOUSING POLICY DIVISION. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH CD. TWENTY NINETEEN I WOULD EAT CITIES IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR. EXECUTIVE ORDER. IN A SEPARATE WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DEFENSE AND ISCHEMIC TGS TO BRING EIGHTEENTH MISSION AND OUR EXPERTISE OF DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTO THIS WORK. BEFORE HEARING ABOUT EACH CITIES ROLE IN THIS WORK I WANT TO MAKE A QUICK DISTINCTION BETWEEN LOCAL SURPLUS PROPERTY. AND STATE ACCESS PROPERTY- BINDING ABILITY TO TYPE THE PROPERTY IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION INCLUDING ON THE AUDIT REQUEST BEING CONSIDERED. AS THEY ARE SIMILAR BUT VERY DISTINCT TYPES OF PROPERTY. THE SURPLUS LAND ACT APPLIED TO LOCAL AGENCY OR DISPOSING OF LOCALLY OWNED. SURPLUS LAND FOR HOUSING OR OTHER USES. BUT IN CONTRAST EXECUTIVE ORDER ON EXCESS SITE CREATED A PATH FOR DTS AND HCV I MAKE STATE OWNED EXCEPT LAND AVAILABLE. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THE ANSWER OF THE IN THE AUDIT REQUEST LETTER I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON EACH EACH FALL AND IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE STATE EXERCISE EXECUTIVE ORDER. FIRST AFTER WE IDENTIFY THE STATE OWNED ACCESS PLAN FOR HOUSING WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. WE CONDUCT OUTREACH TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ENGAGING CITIES AND COUNTIES WERE STATE OWNED LAND EXISTS. LET'S START BY IDENTIFYING CONTACT WITH THE CITY OR COUNTY. WE DON'T HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED CONTACTS FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS SPENDING WORK WE REACH OUT. TO LOCAL HOUSING DEPARTMENT CITY PLANNING CITY MANAGERS OR SIMILAR DEPARTMENTS WERE THINKING ABOUT HOUSING IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY. FROM THERE WE SCHEDULE A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IN STATEMENT AVAILABLE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY. AND- WE QUIETLY INQUIRED ABOUT THEIR LOCAL EFFORTS TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THEIR VISION FOR THAT AREA AND THEIR PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING HOUSING NEED. AND DURING THOSE MEETINGS IT SHOULD BE AN EASY ACCESS ANSWER ANY QUESTION FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO ENGAGE THEIR LOCAL PARTNERS WHICH MAY INCLUDE A PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY. ALSO MAY BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. BUT THROUGH THESE CONVERSATIONS WE CAN BOTH AFFECT ENCOURAGE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS READINESS TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE. TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARCHITECT PLANT. RIGHT AT WEBER OUR- YES. NOW PLEASE PRESIDENT AROUND WHAT. WE APPRECIATE AYE WELL I AM I WILL BE BRIEF EIGHTY LEVERAGES OUR KNOWLEDGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REACH A RANGE OF AND HE FOR INTERESTED IN EXPERIENCE IN SUPPORTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE BUILT AND MAINTAINED A LIST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REACH OUT TO THEM ASIDE FROM THE GF COAST ON THE WEBSITE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WITH TO THE WEARER OF OPPORTUNITIES AND TO MAKE SURE WE TALKED A WIDE NET AROUND THE STATE BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORK I JUST DESCRIBED MY FINAL POINT OUR GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND ANY BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WE CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. IN THERE WE BRING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF FINANCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNING ALL AROUND HOUSING TO HELP REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS TO DEVELOPMENT AND WE MEET WITH THE PRINCIPAL STEVEN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WE ACT WITH URGENCY ENCOURAGE INNOVATION TO EXPAND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES BY REMOVING ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST CHALLENGING BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. WHICH IS THE AVAILABILITY OF LAND LIKE CASE AND I WOULD CLOSE BY SAYING THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DIRECTLY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR WORK ON THE EXECUTIVE.

THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DASH EIGHT OH SIX LOCAL HIGH RISK ASSESSMENT THE CITY OF RICHMOND AND WITH THAT LET ME GO AHEAD AND- TURN IT OVER TO- THE BETTER MONITOR FOR HER PRESENTATION ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WILL KEEP OUR PRESENTATION BREAKING I HAVE MISTER CHILDREN WHOSE AND DEPUTY STATE AUDITOR IN OUR OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOCAL I. REST PROGRAM I'LL GIVE YOU SOME THOUGHTS ON WHY WE FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONDUCT MARKET WORK AT THE CITY RICHMOND. ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON THIS MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S MIKE KILLED AND I'M A DEPUTY STATE AUDITOR- I DO THINK THAT. SKEWS ME AS I THINK THE COMMITTEE KNOWS WE HAVE A LOCAL HIGHER RISK OF PROGRAM IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AS A PART OF THAT WE ALSO HAVE. AN INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD THEY WERE RELEASED TWO YEARS AGO. AND RECENTLY THAT PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR US TO EVALUATE THE FINANCES. OF VIRTUALLY EVERY SITTING IN FINGER CALIFORNIA ACT AND PUBLISH THAT INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE AND- SINCE WE'VE HAD THE PROGRAM GOING IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WE'VE REALLY BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT FINANCES OUT OF THE CITY OF RICHMOND. AND SPECIFICALLY- SINCE WE ESTABLISHED THE DASH FOR THE CITY OF RICHMOND HAS REALLY BEEN MOVING UP OUR LIST. OF CITIES THAT ARE OUR MOST FISCALLY CHALLENGED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN OUR MOST RECENT UPDATE TO THE DASHBOARD IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. RICHMOND MOVED UP TO THE FIFTH MOST FISCALLY CHALLENGED CITY IN THE STATE. AND BASICALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THE CITY IS REALLY LACKING. SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESERVES. AND IT REALLY HAS A COMPROMISED ABILITY TO PAY ITS LONG TERM DEBTS. INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT UNFUNDED. RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. THE OTHER THING THAT WE FOR TROUBLE IS. THE CITY IS A HOW TO HARD TIME BALANCING ITS BUDGET OVER THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE TOWARDS FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE SLASH TWENTY TWO BUDGET. THE CITY HAD TO USE OUR- FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN STAINLESS MONEY THAT EXPECTS TO RECEIVE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REALLY BALANCE ITS BUDGET WITHOUT THAT THE CITY HAD A HOLD ITS TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. THE OTHER THING IS WE KNOW THAT THE CITY OF RICHMOND HAS RECENTLY HIRED MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS AMERICAN SOLDIERS COME UP WITH A TEN YEAR FINANCIAL FORECAST. AND NOT FORECAST PROJECTS AT THE CITY'S GENERAL FUND IS GONNA BE STARTING TO RUN A DEFICIT IN JUST A FEW YEARS BY FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AND BASICALLY THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE THE CITY IS EXPENDITURES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW MORE RAPIDLY THAN ITS REVENUES. IT PUTS STRESS FINANCES. AND SO JUST TO WALK THROUGH THE KEY OBJECTIVES IN OUR OUR PROPOSAL VERY QUICKLY IF THE ARTS APPROVED WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THE CITY'S FINANCES PROGRAM ASSESS ITS CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT ITS ABILITY TO PAY ITS BILLS BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM WE'RE GONNA IDENTIFY REALLY THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THE CITY OF RICHMOND HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING. FOR QUITE SOME TIME WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE CITY'S BUDGETING PRACTICES WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THEIR FINANCIAL FORECASTS OF AN ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE OF THE PROJECTIONS BOARDS REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE CITY'S PROCESS PROCESSING FEES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE CITY SETTING PLEASE AN APPROPRIATE MANNER THAT COVERS THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT ANY OTHER ARTS HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE CITY'S EXTERNAL FINANCIAL AUDITORS WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT HAS DONE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DUPLICATE ANY OF THAT WORK BUT WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW UP TO SEE WHAT WITHIN CITY HAS ACTUALLY MOVED FORWARD WITH IMPLEMENTING. ANY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT I THINK OF. IF THE COMMITTEE APPROVED THIS OP. WHAT THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE IS GOING TO PROVIDE. IS REALLY A COMPREHENSIVE. LISTING OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN PROVIDE A BLUE PRINT. FOR THE CITY OF RICHMOND TO REALLY TURN AROUND ITS FINANCES ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WE ALSO HAVE A VERY ROBUST PROCESS IN PLACE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MONITOR THE CITY'S EFFORTS. TO IMPLEMENT A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IN AS A PART OF THAT WE SEE THIS IS A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE CAN BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WILL BE THERE TO PROVIDE ADVICE TO THE CITY. AND TO SUPPORT ITS EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT A CORRECTIVE CTION PLAN THAT WOULD ADDRESS ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AT THE END OF THE DAY RESULT IN THE PROVISION OF MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SERVICES FOR ITS RESIDENTS. IN TERMS OF BUDGET WE THINK THIS THING WILL TAKE ABOUT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED HOURS AND ADEQUATE TO ABOUT A FOUR MONTH AUDIT EFFORT. BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ON SITE IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND PERFORMANCE LIKELY WE'D BE THERE FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS THE REST OF THE TIME WE BE. PLANNING SUMMARIZING OUR WORK IN DOING REPORT WRITING SO WE DON'T SEE THIS AS BEING A BURDEN TO THE CITY OF RICHMOND WHO WOULD GET IN THERE GET OUR WORK DONE AS EFFECTIVELY. AND EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN. RIGHT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME LET'S MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES. I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOMEONE ON THE LINE FROM THE CITY OF RICHMOND- MADAM OERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE Q. THE CITY OF RICHMOND. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. PLEASE PROCEED.

THAT MOTION CARRIES WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO ADD ON THAT TAKES US TO OUR FINAL ITEM FROM CENTER HERTZBERG THIS IS AGENDA ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE DASH ONE ONE FIVE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM SUTTER HERTZBERG WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE I AM READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR CHAIRMAN- AFTER THE PASSAGE OF PROP THIRTEEN AND PART OF THE WHOLE US SERRANO VERSUS PRIEST CASES OF THOSE RECALL THE IMPACTS OF ALLOCATING MONEY AND RESOURCES PARTICULARLY FOR SCHOOLS AREN'T THERE HAS BEEN EFFORTS FOR MANY MANY YEARS WHAT YOU KNOW SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT OF HOW TO FINANCE SCHOOLS HOW DO WE DO THAT PROP THIRTEEN WITH THE LIMITATIONS THERE WAS LESS MONEY COMING FROM THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD NEW SCHOOLS WE HAD FORMALLY DILAPIDATED SCHOOLS WITH THOSE TIMES WITH OVERCROWDING PROBLEMS. WHAT DO WE DO. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. BROWN THE CLOCK NEGOTIATIONS WE FINALLY CAME TO A BREAKTHROUGH IT WAS SB FIFTY. THE AUTHOR ALTHOUGH HE WAS IN THE ROOM AS OFTEN HAPPENS WAS. LEROY GREEN TOOL TO QUIT FOR THOSE THAT REMEMBER. HE WAS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE WITH NEGOTIATED THIS ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. AND WE CAME UP WITH SB FIFTY WHICH BECAME PROPOSITION ONE A. WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE VOTERS- BY SCHOOL FINANCE WAS QUITE BRILLIANT. IN TERMS OF HOW IT WORKS. EXCEPT IT HAD SOME ISSUES- THERE WAS A CASE FILED BY A SERIES OF GROUPS ONE OF THE PEOPLE TO WITNESS HERE TODAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SAN FRANCISCO CALLED WILLIAMS VERSUS STATE SUBSEQUENTLY GO TO AS- CURSES SCHWARZENEGGER IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THAT LOOKED AT THE ALLOCATION ON POPULATION AND THERE WAS A ISSUE OF SCHOOLS WE ARE BUILDING NEW SCHOOLS VERSUS COMMUNITIES WHERE THE HAD SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IT WAS QUITE IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE BILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT FROM THE SCHOOL FACILITIES FUNDING STATE ALLOCATION BOARD. SUBSEQUENT TO THAT. I ACTUALLY CREATED A BE SIXTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND TWO THOUSAND FOUR. WHICH RESULTED IN BY THE WAY THAT PROP ONE A. WAS NINE POINT SOMETHING BILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN I DID PROP BUT SB SIXTEEN WHICH WAS PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE BOTH OF WHICH PASSED. AUTHORIZING MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION SCHOOL MODERNIZATION SUBSEQUENT TO THAT SCHWARZEN SCHNITZEL DID ONE. UP PROPOSITION ONE D. PASSED AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE PASSED IT YOU KNOW- SHOULD TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO FUND THE SCHOOLS. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED HAS BEEN THERE'S BEEN A QUESTION BROADLY SPEAKING BROADLY SPEAKING THAT AS A RESULT THERE HAS BEEN. THE BILL GROUP ENROLLMENT GROWTH HAS DRAMATICALLY SLOWED ACROSS THE STATE THE RECENT YEARS. IT IS DECLINING IN MANY COMMUNITIES AND THE EMPHASIS BY THE STATE FACILITIES PROGRAM HAS SHIFTED FROM CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FACILITIES TO MODERNIZATION AND REHABILITATION OF EXISTING SCHOOL FACILITIES. A TWENTY TWENTY. STUDY BY THE PUBLIC POLICIES CALIFORNIA BORDER WHICH ARE USED TO SERVE ON FOUND THAT 38% OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS GO TO SCHOOLS THAT DON'T MEET THE MINIMUM FACILITY STANDARDS. THERE WAS ALSO A STUDY. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN STUDY BY BERKELEY SIMILARLY DEALING WITH INADEQUATE AND INEQUITABLE FACILITIES IN A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY BY STANFORD UNIVERSITY SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS. AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES AS WE EMBARK ON ON THE NEXT STEP. ALL OF SCHOOL FACILITIES FINANCING WHICH WE HAVE TO DO WHICH I FUNDAMENTALLY SUPPORT. WE NEED DATA AND I WANT TO I WANT YOU KNOW MENTION THIS IN MY CLOTHES ON. TO NARROW THE TERM I WAS TOLD BY THE AUDITOR WAS DETERMINES DOWN SCOPE THE AUDIT JUST TO DEAL WITH MODERNIZATION NUMBER ONE. AND TWO TO ASK FOR URGENCY IF THAT'S THE RIGHT TERM SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS DONE IN TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S EDUCATED. WHAT ARE THE STUDIES SHOW. IS THERE A REAL ISSUE OR NOT IF IT IS WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THE ISSUE. AND THEN INCORPORATE THAT IN OUR HOUSE AND TWENTY TWO EFFORTS OR ANY OTHER EFFORTS BEYOND. SO THAT THE BOTTOM LINE OF OUR BODIES LEGISLATURE. IS TO TRY TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS TO CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING. AND THEN THE CONT CONSCIOUSLY AND COVER AND CONSISTENTLY COURSE CORRECT TO LEARN TO GROW TO GET BETTER TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK BETTER TO IMPROVE WHAT'S GOING ON. THE PATTERNS OF STUDENTS IS GOING SCHOOLS CHANGED. THE NUMBER OF NEW SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN PAID EVAN- BUILT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY. BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE TO BE ON OUR TOES WE HAVE TO BE ON TOP OF IT SO THIS IS NOT AN AUDIT THAT'S DOING ANYTHING. THAT'S ADVERSE TO SCHOOLS IT CELEBRATES. AND I WANT TO FOCUS THAT NEAR THE FOCUS DOWNSIZED TO JUST. IN THE IN THE LETTER TO MODERNIZATION BECAUSE THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THIS WHAT WE GOTTA DO TO MODERNIZATION DOES THE COMMUNITIES ARE FACING THE CHALLENGE AND TO. ASK FOR URGENCY PROVISION SO THAT THIS THING CAN GET DONE QUICKLY AND WE CAN BE INFORMED AS WE MARCH FORWARD IN THE IMPORTANT. PROCESS OF EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE IN CLASSROOMS THAT THEY'RE SAFE. AND WE GET IT RIGHT AND WE CONTINUE TO DO IT AND THE NEXT LEGISLATURE AND THE NEXT LEGISLATURE FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPROVE IT. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR TWENTY SOME YEARS AND EVERY DAY I KEEP LEARNING AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER STEP FORWARD IN THAT MARCH I ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF THE SITE. THANK SENATOR HERTZBERG NAY DO BELIEVE YOU HAVE- TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT FOR MR WHICH I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU. I DON'T GET THAT FOR THOSE PEOPLE HAVE PERFECT EYES. HERE'S A PICTURE THAT'S IN MY OFFICE OF THE NEGOTIATING TEAM. BIPARTISAN NEGOTIATING TEAM BACK IN NINETY EIGHT. THAT LED THIS NEGOTIATIONS STARTED THE PROCESS IT WAS A LOT OF FUN. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR SHARING A BIT OF HISTORY WITH US IN THE PHOTO FREESHEET THAT AT THIS TIME LET'S MOVE TO MADAM OPERATOR TO THE PHONE LINES DO WE HAVE STEVE ENGLISH THE FOUNDING CO DIRECTOR OF THE ADVANCEMENT PROJECT ON THE LINE TO SPEAK IN. AS A TESTIMONY WITNESS. I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I GET RIGHT TO THE POINT NOW SPEAK FAST- SEVERAL ACADEMIC STUDIES HAVE FOUND- DISTURBING PATTERNS AS A MISTER TENDER'S BIGGEST SUGGESTED OF THE IN IN IN EQUITY IN THE EXPENDITURES OF STATE FUNDS- FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES PROJECTS- GENERALLY- SCHOOL FACILITIES PROJECTS ARE FUNDED WITH A COMBINATION OF STATE DOLLARS AND DOLLARS RAISED BY A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THE STATE MATCHES THE LOCAL THE LOCALLY RAISED FUNDS ACCORDING TO A FORMULA AND THE FORMULA IS DIFFERENT FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT. MY MAIN FOCUS HERE IS WITH MODERNIZATION PROJECT THESE ARE PROJECTS TO UPGRADE EXISTING FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE TO REPLACE A LEAKY ROOF OR FAILING HVAC SYSTEM. WHEN THE RESEARCHERS- LOOKED AT THE AMOUNTS THAT THE STATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECEIVED IN MODERNIZATION FUNDING FROM THE STATE OVER A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD THEY FOUND A VERY GREAT DISPARITY IN WHAT WAS GIVEN TO THE DISTRICTS BY THE STATE ON A PER PUPIL BASIS. FOR EXAMPLE THE BEST A FUNDED DISTRICT THE TOP 20% OF THE DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVED THE HIGHEST FUNDING PER PUPIL- THEY RECEIVED ON AVERAGE OVER TWENTY YEARS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND. FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER PUPIL IN STATE MODERNIZATION FUNDING IN CONTRAST TO THE WORST BONTA DISTRICT THE 20% TO RECEIVE THE LEAST STATE FUNDING RECEIVED ON AVERAGE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS PER PUPIL IN THE MODERNIZATION FUNDING FROM THE STATE. THE RESEARCHERS ALSO FOUND A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN THE WEALTH OF A DISTRICT IN TERMS OF THE PROPERTY VALUES IN THE DISTRICT AND THE AMOUNT OF MODERNIZATION FUNDS TO DISTRICTS RECEIVED FROM THE STATE IN GENERAL THE WEALTHY DISTRICTS WERE THE ONES THAT RECEIVED THE MOST STATE FUNDING PER PUPIL. AND THE POOREST TO. WERE THE ONES THAT RECEIVE THE LEAST. STATE FUNDING PER PUPIL- AS- CENTER HER FERGUS- ABOUT 4% OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS GO TO SCHOOLS THAT DO NOT MEET MINIMUM FACILITY STANDARDS. AND THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF DEFICIENCIES ARE IN THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE LOWER PROPERTY VALUES. SO STATE FUNDS ARE BEING PAID OUT HERE AND IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH THERE IS WARRANT. FOR THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO BRING IT TO POLICY EXPERTS PEACE AND ANALYTICAL SKILLS. TO BEAR HERE TO REVIEW AND VALIDATE OR DISPEL UPDATE THESE ACADEMIC FINDINGS ABOUT THE EXISTENCE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF ANY WEALTH BASED IN EQUITY IN THE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM. THANK YOU MISTER ENGLISH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO- THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION. OF THE REQUEST THAT'S WITHIN THE SCOPE AND RULES OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. MADAM AUDITOR PLEASE PROCEED THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- AS CENTER HERTZBERG INDICATED HIT IT APPEARS HIS HE WANTS US TO FOCUS ON MODERNIZATION WHICH- WE CAN WE CAN CERTAINLY DO- BUT LET ME GO THROUGH THE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE IN THE YARD ANALYSIS. UP CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL CAN NAY OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION THEIR ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHOOL FACILITIES OUT PROGRAMS FUNDING WHICH WOULD INCLUDE FUNDING RELATED TO MODERNIZATION. I'M ALSO LOOKING AT METHODS BY WHICH BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FINANCE ARE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF CRITICAL FACILITIES AND WE CAN WE CAN PAIR BACK- REVIEW OF CONSTRUCTION AND REALLY FOCUS ON MODERNIZATION. BUT I THINK THE HEART OF THE QUESTIONS THAT- CENTER HERTZBERG AND HIS WITNESSES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR CLEARLY OBJECTIVES FOR FIVE AND SIX- THE FLOOR IS RELATED TO LOOKING AT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LOOKING AT HER PUPIL VALUE OF ASSESSED PROPERTY. AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND ASSESS WHETHER THERE ARE EQUITY GAPS IN FINANCING- OBJECTIVE FIVE LOOKS AGAIN AT A SELECTION OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND EVALUATING THOSE DISTRICTS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE SAFE AND ADEQUATE PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES FOR. CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT THE SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY CARDS OUR REPORT CARDS WHICH REPORT ON CONDITIONS IN SCHOOLS AND DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT SCHOOLS ARE MEETING MINIMUM BENCHMARKS ARE THEIR DEFICIENCIES WERE THE DISTRICTS DOING TO MITIGATE THOSE DEFICIENCIES- SS SILVA NEEDS IDENTIFY OUTCOMES. EVALUATE METHODS BY WHICH- DISTRICTS ARE FINANCING WE SAY CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE- THAT SOUNDS LIKE HE WANTS US TO REALLY FOCUS ON MODERNIZATION- SO WE WOULD WOULD- PARA BACK OR NOT REALLY. LOOK AT CONSTRUCTION- OBJECTIVE SIX AS THE FUTURE NEED FOR MODERN IS. AND PRESENT BY OP IF THEY ARE THAT WE COULD IDENTIFY BASED ON LOOKING AT RESEARCH AT CETERA- FOR REVENUE THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE IS REALLY TO THE EXTENT WE POSSIBLY CAN'T AGAIN I BELIEVE AND WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS WE THINK WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT RESEARCH WHERE. IT'S TRYING TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF DEFERRED MODERNIZATION DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON STATEWIDE. HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES- IF THERE'S DEFERRED MODERNIZATION DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF SCHOOL FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. I'M CURRENTLY REPORTS TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED HOURS IF WE PARED BACK I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN EXACT ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH THE ON IT WOULD- THE COST OF THE AUDIT AND THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO COMPLETE WOULD BE REDUCED BUT IT. CERTAINLY WOULD BE REDUCED. THAT'S IT MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OUR WATER AND THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. AS WELL WE APPRECIATE THAT WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES- WITH THIS. PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE I BELIEVE WE HAVE ON THE LINE LISA SILVERMAN.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES AND DELIGHTED TO STAND UP ON THIS- MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FERNANDO WHO BLAZED THE TRAIL HERE. I CAN SAY I SOMEWHAT PRECEDED HIM IN TERMS OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION I THINK I'M STILL THE THIRD LONGEST TENURED MEMBER ON THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD WHICH IS THE STATE ENTITY THAT ALLOCATES THE FUNDING. AND I SERVED WITH THE LEGENDARY LEROY GREAT NO ONE WILL EXCEED LEROY'S TENURE BUT I CAME CLOSE. DURING THOSE YEARS IN THIS WOULD BE THROUGH THE LATE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES. WE MOSTLY WERE FOCUSED ON ALLOCATING DOLLARS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. BUT WHAT WE SAW WAS A TREMENDOUS DEMAND AND NEED ON REHABILITATION WE ALSO SAW THAT AS A GOOD WAY TO EXPAND OUR ADVOCACY OUR VALUE TO THE KIDS TO THE SCHOOLS BY THE REHABILITATING. AND SAVING SOME OF THE SCHOOLS THAT WERE DETERIORATING. NOW WE'VE COME A LONG WAYS EVEN FURTHER WHEREBY WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENT. AND WITH FACILITIES DETERIORATING. THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE DYNAMICS. AND THIS WOULD BE A GOOD ATTEMPT FOR US TO GET MORE CURRENT AND NOT JUST BE DEALING WITH SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. FROM SUPPOSITION. AND GUESSING THIS WOULD GIVE US SOMETHING CONCRETE SO I CERTAINLY ENDORSE THIS I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND IT WOULD BE A VERY NEEDED IDEA BASED ON CONTEMPORARY CIRCUMSTANCES. THANK YOU SENATOR LET ME ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. LET ME GO AHEAD AND JUST SAY CENTER HERTZBERG THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD I BELIEVE IT'S HIGHLY COMMENDABLE I THINK IT'S MORALLY RIGHT THAT WE LOOK AT THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN WEALTHY AND LOWER INCOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
