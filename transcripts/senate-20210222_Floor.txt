OF ALLOWING SENATE BILLS INTRODUCED IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS CALENDAR YEAR ONLY TO BE AMENDED HEARD AND ACTED UPON BY THE SENATE BEFORE THIRTY CALENDAR DAYS HAVE ELAPSED THESE REQUESTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE RULES COMMITTEE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS BALANCE PLEASE READ THE RESOLUTION. RESOLVED THAT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE FOUR SECTION EIGHT A OF THE CONSTITUTION SENATE BILLS INTRODUCED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BEING MAYBE HEARD IN COMMITTEE AND ACTED UPON BY THE SENATE BEFORE THIRTY CALENDAR DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE INTRODUCTION AND THAT THREE WILL FIFTY FIVE BE SUSPENDED TO PERMIT SUCH HEARING AND ACTION PRIOR TO BEING IN PRINT FOR THIRTY DAYS. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY MEMBERS DISCUSSION AT OR DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN MONITORED INQUIRY. PLEASE BECAUSE I MISS THE INQUIRE OF THE PROGRAM ARE THESE TRAILER BILLS OR JUST REGULAR SENATE BILL. THANK YOU FOR THE CALL- THE ARE. BILLS THANK YOU. BILLS. TO THANK YOU CENTER NELSON MAY ANY DISK FOR YES SENATOR. IT'S IN MY MIND. BERMAN. OKAY THANK YOU MEDICARE I UNDER THE SCHEDULE IN THE NEED DISK WORK HEARINGS IN THE MOST WAY ESPECIALLY DURING THE COLD WITH THE AND HAVE HOWEVER SINCE BEEN THE CON OF THE STATE LIMITED TRANCE BY NOT BILLS TO BE IN PRINT FOR THIRTY DAYS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I CAN SUPPORT JUST AS WE SAW IN REGARDS TO COPE WITH NINETEEN DATA CALIFORNIANS WANT MORE TRANSPARENCY FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THEIR AND THEIR GOVERNMENT TO WORK BETTER FOR THEM BY NOT ALLOWING THE STATE IF AT BY NOT ALLOWING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS CITIZENS THIRTY DAYS TO READ AND DIGEST THE BILL. SO THAT THEY CAN MOBILIZE IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION AND FRANKLY JUST KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS BUILDING AND IT COME UP AND COMMENT ON IT OR ACTUALLY ZOOM IN A COMMENT ON IT NOW IT'S AN UNACCEPTABLE AND I THINK I DIMINISHES BOTH TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS I'M ASKING ALL OF YOU COLLEAGUES NOT TO SUSPEND THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH HE DO WE SWORE TO UPHOLD AND STAND BY THE VOTERS IN THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA DEMANDING TRANSPARENCY AND NOT LESS AND. I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS MOTION. THANK SENATOR GROW FROM FOR JUST. OR DEBATE. CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I AM A STUDENT OF THIS INSTITUTION. I HOLD THE CONSTITUTION IN THE GREATEST REVERENCE THAT ANYONE CAN. THE GENIUS OF OUR CONSTITUTION AND THE FRAMEWORK THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT ITS CORE IS UMAN. WE ARE FACING AN EXTRAORDINARY GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WE AS A BODY TRYING TO REPRESENT THE NEAR FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT OUR TRYING TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT CREATES THE GREATEST LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY TO THOSE IN THIS BUILDING WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE- TO THE TO THE RISK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE STAFF EVERYBODY INVOLVED. AS WELL AS TO A PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE PUBLIC TO BE HEARD. WE SAW LAST YEAR'S WE TRY TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO BALANCE THOSE INTERESTS THAT WE HAD HEARINGS THAT LASTED INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING. WE HAD MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SITTING ON PHONE LINES FOR SEVEN EIGHT HOURS THAT WAS WRONG. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS A REQUEST TO PROVIDE SOME ABILITY TO IN FACT INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE. WE ONLY HAVE TWO HEARING ROOMS BECAUSE WE CAN'T SOCIAL INJUSTICE THIS CHAMBER AND FORTY TWO OH THREE. HOW DO WE MANAGE A SEVEN WEEK SCHEDULE AS A SENATE. THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE TO NOT SIT ON THE PHONE FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS AS THEY'VE DONE BEFORE. WHAT WE DO IS WE INCREASE THE TIME PERIOD WHICH IS THE UNDERLYING REASON FOR THIS VERY LIMITED REQUEST TO SUSPEND THE JOINT RULES IN THE CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW US TO HAVE HEARINGS TWO IN THE MORNING AND TWO IN THE AFTERNOON. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE OF THE WAIT SO LONG BUT THAT ACTUALLY THEY WERE THAT MANY PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. THEY DIDN'T TRAVEL TO SACRAMENTO TO AS WE FACE THIS EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE FOR THE PANDEMIC EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE EXTRAORDINARY. AND I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT YES THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO. BUT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES ANYTHING LESS I WOULD SAY I WOULD JOIN. US SENATOR GROSVENOR POINT OF VIEW BUT I THINK THAT UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE VIDEO PER OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE THIS IS A THOUGHTFUL AND REASONABLE SOLUTION THAT TO ME IS CONSISTENT WITH THE UNDERLYING FRAMEWORK OF OUR CONSTITUTION I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTERVILLE'S. NOT A PRIVILEGE ON THIS I THE MADE REFERENCE TO THIS BEFORE QUITE OFTEN THAT I REPEATED RIGHT NOW. AS FAR AS. IT THE INPUT OF THE PA. WE REALLY DON'T DO THAT HERE PROTECTING IN THE COMMITTEES. WE'RE ALLOWING THE PRESENTER. THEN WATER PEOPLE SAYING I LIKE THE BILL AND GET SUMMARIES. THANK FOR THE OPPOSITION. EVERYBODY FROM OF THESE PEOPLE FIT HOURS ON THE PHONE. THEY GET SAY. I'M JAMES. J. I'M AGAIN THAT ALL. I SUBMIT IS NOT PUBLIC AND I HAVE THIS NOT BEEN TO THAT. IN THE- BUT I'M GOING TO BEGIN TO. THAT IS NOT WHICH PUBLIC INPUT JUST TAKE CAL. THE AS YOU PRIORITIZE YOUR MAIL LOAD AND PUT SURE THE MASH FOR OF LETTERS COME IN. YOU DON'T GET A PRICE EVERYONE YOU GOTTA TELL. WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY WE COULD DO. RIGHT NOW WE ARE BY I SEE THE CAR TO MORE IN. THAT'S JUST TAKE A CAB THEN BY A LOT OF TIME IT'S NOT PUBLIC INPUT ALL YOU DO IS SAY I JIM I'M AGAINST. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON. THING NO FURTHER JUST. OR DEBATE SAID ATKINS WOULD YOU LIE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU YES MA'AM PER. I WOULD JUST MAKE A CUP OF FINAL. OF THE- ACTS ALLOW LA. TO TAKE ACTION SUCH AS THIS. AND I FURTHER SAY IT IS A RESPONSE ACTION. THIS YEAR WE'VE HAD OVER A WE HAD EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINE BILLS- SUBMITTED. OVER TWO HUNDRED OF THOSE ARE SPOT BILLS WHICH MEANS MORE INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED BEFORE THEY ARE SET FOR HEARING AT COMMITTEES. LAST YEAR MEMBERS IN THE SENATE AND I WANT TO AGAIN THANK YOU REDUCE THEIR BILL LOAD SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THAT WE WERE IN WITH THE PANDEMIC AND THE UNCERTAINTY. THIS YEAR WE HAVE SOME MORE CERTAINTY BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCHEDULE THINGS APPROPRIATELY SO THAT PEOPLE WILL BE SAFE PROTECTED AND WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. I THINK ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF OUR DECISION AS A SENATE BODY TO ALLOW REMOTE PARTICIPATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WAS TO ENSURE THAT MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC PEOPLE THAT DON'T USUALLY GET TO COME UP HERE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN- AND AT LEAST SAY THEIR NAME WHERE THEY RESIDE AND THAT THEY AGREE OR DISAGREE. AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING I HOPE WE FIND A WAY TO CONTINUE BEYOND THIS PANDEMIC TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC SO. I THINK THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE ACTION I THINK IT IS DUE. TO WHAT THE MAJORITY LEADER HAS SAID IN TERMS OF US TRYING TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND YET DO OUR BUSINESS I SAID THAT OUR BILLS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CUT LAST YEAR. THIS WOULD BE A SECOND YEAR IN WHICH WE AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. OUGHT WERE WE TO ACT DIFFERENTLY AND DO WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR AND REALLY PUSH TO CUT OUR BILL LOAD. WOULD NOT BE DOING THE JOB THAT WE FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO DO TO PRESENT LEGISLATION SO. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THIS BODY TO SUPPORT THIS ACTION FOR THIS CALENDAR YEAR. GIVEN ALL OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. BY MYSELF IN THE MAJORITY LEADER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT VIRGIN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM MEMBER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

AND WHAT DOES HAPPEN A LOT OF FUN AND GAMES OCCURS IN THESE BILLS THAT ARE NOT THROUGH THE DELIVERY PROCESS OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND EVEN SHORT CIRCUITED IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEES. SO THEREFORE THE PUBLIC THROUGH US DO NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND FUN GAMES ARE INDEED. INVOLVED AND INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF BILLS.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST WANTED. TO SAY THAT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN THIS BILL. AND WE HEARD IT DURING BUDGET AND I DID BRING UP THE FACT THAT THERE IS THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS THE LAST YEAR'S CONTRACT AND SO. FOR THOSE REASONS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD. NEVER ALLOW. A ONE OF OUR AGENCIES TO GO OUT AND DO AN R. F. P. WITH A HANDFUL. OF- WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR IT AND NOT DO IT IN THE DAYLIGHT AND SO. FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THINK IT'S WRONG. THAT WERE SLIPPING IN. THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM LAST YEAR'S CONTRACT IT IS- QUITE FRANKLY THERE'S A LAWSUIT ABOUT SO FOR THOSE REASONS. I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY SEVERAL CHOI BOGUE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE WITH CONCERNS ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTY FIVE THIS HAS SO MUCH GOOD IN IT MONEY FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FUNDING FOR PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS TWENTY FOUR CHILD CARE IN OUR CAL WORKS FAMILY MANY OF WHOM I'M HERE TO ADVOCATE. ON THEIR BEHALF. YEAH THERE'S A PORTION OF IT THAT SEEKS TO MAKE AN ILLEGAL CONTRACT LEGAL BY RETROACTIVELY CHANGING STATUTES. AFTER TAKING TIME TO REVIEW THE BILL I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TODAY. BUT I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROCESS. AS A FRESHMAN LEGISLATOR LEGISLATOR I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT A BILL WITH SO MANY GOOD THINGS AS AN ITEM THAT IS CURRENTLY SO CONTROVERSIAL. MOVING FORWARD I'M READY TO WORK WIH ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO DEVELOP POLICIES THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR OCHO BOGUE CENTER BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I HAVE A HARD TO BEGIN WITH I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. IF FIVE THE- SHE WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE. SENATE RATES I'M SORRY WHAT DID YOU SAY. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR IF SHE'S WILLING TO TAKE THAT. YEAH THERE ARE USUALLY TAKES I'M GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS YES PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU- THE AMERICAN WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN THAT THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD IN THE BILL THAT I THINK THAT THE ISSUE REGARDING THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. HI TO COVER THE SECRETARY OF STATE EXPENDITURE FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS IS THE ONE THAT'S VERY VERY QUESTIONABLE SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK- IF THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HAS INDICATED THAT THE AMENDMENT IS ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS HER CONCERNS. AND NUMBER TWO CAN FEDERAL FUNDS I THINK THERE'S TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNDER THE HELP AMERICA VOTE ACT LAWFULLY BE USED FOR THE GET OUT THE VOTE ACTIVITIES. AND I'D LIKE TO RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEN ON I WILL SPEAK ON MY OWN. YEAH THANK YOU. FIVE FIVE- MEMBERS. PLEASE OKAY. YES SO WE HAVE BEFORE US IS A TECH FIX THAT BOTH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE WORKED OUT WHICH CORRECTS WHAT WAS RAISED BY THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AS AMBIGUITY IN THE LANGUAGE AND THEY BOTH NOW BOTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AN THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AGREED THAT THIS LANGUAGE REMOVES THAT PAYING. AMBIGUITY AND IN RELATIONSHIP TO. THE FEDERAL QUESTION THIS PROGRAM THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE PROGRAM. WAS AFTER STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT WERE CONVENE WITH COUNTY OFFICIALS AND THE WORK GROUP OF COUNTY OFFICIALS INC AND OTHERS RECOMMENDED THE STATE WIDE CONTRACT FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. NONPARTISAN AIMED AT VOTERS WHO ARE VOTING BY MAIL FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WHO SPOKE EIGHT LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH SO THAT'S WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS DANTE AGAIN IN ANSWER TO THE DIRECT QUESTION ABOUT THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE YES THIS MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND IS AN AGREEMENT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI MY OWN TIME MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE. I THINK IT KIND OF MISSES THE POINT HERE SO I DO URGE OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE. RETROACTIVELY CHANGING THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALLOWED THE VERSION OF MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY. MEANT TO HELP COUNTIES AND I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND I KNOW THAT THAT MANY DURING OUR ELECTION IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT- IT HELPS COUNTIES COVER THE COSTS OF HOLDING ELECTION DURING A PANDEMIC. I TO A PARTISAN AND POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS WAS JUST NOT RIGHT IT IS WRONG FOR ALL OF OUR COUNTIES IS WRONG FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS THE FIRM THAT WAS SELECTED PRETTY PROMINENTLY STATED ON ITS WEBSITE. THAT IT WAS ON TEAM BYTON IT ALSO IT IS ALSO THE CASE OF THE FIRM WAS DOING WOK ON SEVERAL TARGETED CONGRESSIONAL RACES IN CALIFORNIA. THE CONTRACTOR NOT COMPLY WITH THE PUBLIC CONTRAST CODE AND THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT UP. IN THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS UNDER THE HELP AMERICA VOTE ACT CAN LAWFULLY BE USED FOR GET OUT THE VOTE ACTIVITIES. AND I WAS HERE WHEN THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN PRIOR SECRETARY OF STATE KEVIN SHELLEY HAD TO RESIGN. DUE TO HIS MISUSE OF HAVE A FUNDING. ARE YOU SURE THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE THE LEGISLATURE DOWN A PATH OF MISUSE OF HAVE A FUNDS I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE SHADY CONTRACTOR CURRENT. LEASE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHY WOULD WE THE SENATE WANT TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF SUCH A MASS RIGHT NOW. LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THESE ISSUES LET'S SEE WHAT COMES THROUGH THE AUDIT OF THE CONTRACT. AND RATHER THAN TURN OUR BACK ON IT NOW I URGE YOU KNOW THE- THANK YOU SENATOR. SAID MELINDA. THANK YOU MAY PRESIDENT I WOULD AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND JUST ADD THAT I TO RISE. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THIS THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT WHICH IT SEEMS WE ARE TRYING TO RETROACTIVELY SAY WAS APPROPRIATE WHEN IN FACT. IT WASN'T APPROPRIATE WHICH IS WHY THE BILL WAS NEVER PAID WE SAW THIS THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME JUST SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS WE SAW THIS. WITH THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT CAME IN FOR HOMEOWNERS WERE UNDERWATER THAT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION AND DECIDE TO USE FOR SOMETHING ELSE AFTER THE FACT. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I BELIEVE. THAT SAID IT'S OKAY THEY WE DID IT RETROACTIVELY NINETY I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE WAY TO HANDLE THIS FOR THOSE REASONS- I WILL BE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL JAY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT.

AND WITHOUT MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I HAVE A QUESTION THE AUTHORED BY MAY THURSDAY WE TAKE A QUESTION YES PLEASE PROCEED THOROUGHLY. IN A SO THIS IS ON- THE CAPPY PAYMENTS THOUGH THERE'S A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WHICH I UNDERSTAND THAT SSI AND S. S. P. AND I TEN FILERS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A WAY TO TRACK ALL THOSE FOLKS WHO WE WOULD KNOW- WHO'S RECEIVING THE BENEFITS BUT THE CAPPER- IS A WE ARE UNDER THE EDT. PROCESS WE JUST WENT THROUGH WE HAD ALL KINDS OF FRAUD. SO I'M I'M WONDERING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO LIKE MAKE THE PAYMENTS AND HOW HOW WOULD THEY BE QUALIFY THAT'S- A CONCERN I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD. A SOME INFORMATION OF HOW THAT. THAT POLICY ACTUALLY WOULD WORK OUT. SANDERS CAN. THANK YOU D. CAPPY PROGRAM DOES EXIST AND WHILE UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE ALSO EXISTED CAPPY RECIPIENTS ARM PRIMARILY ARE ALREADY LOGGED INTO THAT PROGRAM SO DIFFERENT THAN THE WHAT WE EXPERIENCE WITH TDD WHERE THERE WAS A WHOLE NEW SET OF PEOPLE WHO QUALIFIED AND DUSTY D. HAD TO PROCESS LOTS OF NEW APPLICATIONS IN MOST CASES ARE CAPPY RECIPIENTS ARE ALREADY FOLKS FOR IN THE CAPPY SYSTEM. TELL US TWENTY EDT SITUATION WHERE WE HAD THE FRAUD THEY EXCLUDED THE- EMPLOYERS FROM THAT FOR A BIG PERIOD OF TIME THEY EXCLUDED EMPLOYERS FROM VERIFYING- SO IN THIS CASE WHO WOULD VERIFY I'M I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S THAT. EVERYBODY IS ELIGIBLE- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HURTING THIS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO. ABILITY FOR FRAUD I MEAN I TEN FATHERS ABSOLUTELY WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE FILING WE SO WE HAVE A RECORD. SO JUST A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED THAT THERE COULD BE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FRAUD HERE DUPLICATIONS MANY DUPLICATIONS THAT'S THAT'S THE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE. THAT IN JUST AT THE PROCESS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. SOME OF AN ANSWER I GUESS I DIDN'T REALLY AYE MAYBE BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS ACTUALLY HOW IT WORKS- WELL I WILL DO MY BEST RIGHT NOW TO ELIMINATE THOSE SINCE I DON'T PERSONALLY ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU ALL THE DETAIL THAT YOU. MAY- D. WHAT CAPITAL IS EQUIVALENT TO FF HI FOUR OR DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHICH IS WHY THESE FOLKS ARE ALREADY IN THE PROGRAM AND IT IS A- THE OTHER SITUATION IS THAT IT'S A FAR SMALLER NUMBER. THEN WHAT EDG WAS HAVING TO PROCESS AND BEING A FAR SMALLER NUMBER IT IS EASIER TO DO VERIFICATIONS THEN OBVIOUSLY WHEN ANY AGENCY CONFRONTS THE TYPE OF VOLUME THAT R. E. D. D. SYSTEM CONFRONTED. ON MY OWN TIME I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER I THANK YOU FOR AYE- AS YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE WE'VE LOST MIL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO. FOLKS WHO HAVE DUPLICATED IN OUR EVEN STOLE SOMEBODY ELSE'S IDENTITY- IN OTHER PROGRAMS AND SO- I APPRECIATE TO THE CHAIR- TRYING TO EDUCATE ME AND I'M I WANT TO LOOK MORE FOLLOW UP ON IT BUT I WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT. NO THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR. ACTUATION THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE REALLY AREN'T MADE TO HANDLE IT AND THEIR THEIR GAMING IT AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE DOING IT AT THE DETRIMENT OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NINE CENTER SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I'M MADAM PRESIDENT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THIS ACTION AND I WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR. PUTTING FORWARD THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF HAVING THE STATE PROVIDE FUNDS TO OUR LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS RECOGNIZING THAT EVEN WITH THE SUPPORT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED OUR LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS HAVE REALLY FACED HARDSHIPS. HAVE HAVE HAD EITHER. DIPSTICK AND EXPENSES DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC THAT WERE UNEXPECTED CHILDREN STAYING HOME AND HAVING TO PROVIDE FOOD THEN MEALS THAT OTHERWISE MAY HAVE BEEN COVERED THROUGH THE CHILD CARE PROGRAM OR THEIR SCHOOLS PROGRAM SO MANY ADDITIONAL BURDENS THAT WERE PUT AS WE ALL KNOW ON ALL OF US FOR THIS PANDEMIC BUT FOR WHICH- THE LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS. HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME RESPONDING TO FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE HAVE NOT HAD TO FACE EITHER A REDUCTION IN OUR PAYCHECKS OR ELIMINATION OF OUR PAYCHECKS WHILE THIS PANDEMIC. HAS BEEN- I WOULD ADMIT TO ALL OF US.PRETTY MISERABLE IT HAS BEEN MUCH HARDER ON THOSE CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET SO I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE APPRECIATION TO THE GOVERNOR. TO THE STAFF IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE STAFF IN OUR BUDGET OFFICES AND ALL OF THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR TWO HOUSES AND ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO WORKED ON THIS. AND OUR ACTION TODAY AND OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR WILL SIGN IT VERY QUICKLY AND GIVEN THAT IT IS. FIVE PEOPLE CAN FILE THEIR TAXES NOW FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS IS DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST THOSE PEOPLE WHO FILE TWENTY TWENTY TAXES IT WILL GET TO PEOPLE FAST AND THAT'S GOOD AND IMPORTANT AND I THINK YOU ALL IN WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE.

SENATE BILL NINETY FOUR BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AS WE JUST ASSISTED OUR LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS WE ALSO KNOW. THAT SO MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ALSO GREATLY STRUGGLED IN THIS PANDEMIC. AND THIS BILL PROVIDES SOME RELIEF AND I'LL BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT RELIEF. IT PROVIDES WAIVERS FOR LICENSES OF THE BOARD OF BARBERING IN CARL COSMETOLOGY AND CERTAIN LICENSEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL. AS WE ALL KNOW BERBERS HERE NAIL SALONS AND SIMILAR BUSINESSES WERE PARTICULARLY HARD HIT. AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO CLOSE FOR MOST OF THIS PANDEMIC PERIOD. AND THE BILL APPROPRIATES TWENTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION TO BACK FILL FOR THE BOARD OF BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY TO COVER ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSES. AND THESE LICENSES ARE ACTIVE FOR TWO YEARS SO THE WAIVER COVERS TWO YEARS OR. ONE LICENSING CYCLE. AND THEN ON THE ABC. LIGHT LICENSES AS YOU NO BARS RESTAURANTS AND VENUES OTHER VENUES THAT HAVE ABC LICENSES. HAVE ALSO HAD TO SHUTTER THEIR DOORS FOR MUCH OF THIS YEAR. THE BILL APPROPRIATES FUNDING TO BACK FILL APPROXIMATELY FIFTY NINE THOUSAND LICENSEES. PRIMARILY RESTAURANTS AND BARS. AND THE LICENSEES ARE ACTIVE FOR ONE YEAR HOWEVER THE WAIVER COVERS TWO YEARS OR TWO LICENSING CYCLES. AND I WANT TO AGAIN EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE GOVERNOR. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THIS SUGGESTION AND FOR THE STAFF IN BOTH OF OUR HOUSES WORKING OUT THE DETAILS SO THAT WE HAVE THIS BEFORE US IN WITHOUT AYE ELSEVIER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I DO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE- THE COMMENT THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS JUST EIGHTY INTENSE. A CRIME OFF THE TABLE WHAT ARE RESTAURANTS IN OUR SALONS HAVE SUFFERED- OVER THE LAST YEAR. I HAVE A STYLIST. PART OF ME. SORRY SYSTEM MOTIONING TO FILL IF WE COULD RAISE YOUR MICROPHONE A LITTLE BECAUSE YOU'RE HARD TO HEAR. I HAVE A STYLIST SHE'S A SINGLE MOM AND HAS TWO KIDS. SHE LOST OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE HOME ORDER THAT THE GOVERNOR ISSUED. I'M SURE SHE APPRECIATES HER FIFTY DOLLARS THAT ARE IN THIS BILL THAT SHE WOULD GET BACK OVER A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. BUT AGAIN THAT IS SO MINIMAL COMPARED TO WHAT WAS LOST. THE SALON OWNER IN WHICH MY STYLIST WORKS OUT. HER PERSONAL INCOME WAS REDUCED BY ALMOST SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BUSINESS INCOME WAS REDUCED BY ALMOST SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. BEING THE SALON OWNER IN OUR PERSONAL INCOME WAS REDUCED BY ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUE FOR MOSTLY AND WOMEN AND MOST SINGLE WOMEN I NOTICE IT ALMOST IN THE SALON THAT I GO TO ALMOST EVERY PERSON IN THERE IS A SINGLE MOM. AND I THINK ABOUT THE MONEY THAT THEY LOST AND LIKE I SAID I'M SURE THEY APPRECIATE THIS FIFTY DOLLARS-THAT WILL GO. TOWARDS THEIR LICENSE FEE FOR THE NEXT- OF RETROACTIVELY FOR TWO YEARS. BUT I THINK SOMETHING DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THE REVENUE AND A LOSS BECAUSE THIS WAS A TAKING. THIS IS A TAKING BY GOVERNMENT WITHOUT COMPENSATION THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE. I CALLED A COUPLE OF RESTAURANT AND BAR OWNERS THAT HAVE IN THE DISTRICT. AND I TALKED TO ONE AND HE SAYS THAT HE LOST OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE TOTAL TIME FRAME- ALCOHOL SALES IN RESTAURANTS. A FOOD AND BEVERAGE. SO THAT MONEY WAS LOST SO AGAIN I'M SURE HE'S GOING TO PROCEED HIS UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CREDIT THAT HE WOULD GET FROM ABC. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S ANYWHERE SIGNIFICANT TO WHAT WAS LOST AND WE HAVE. WE HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OR THERE'S NO DOUBT OF THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT LOSS THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND RESTAURANT OWNERS- IN OUR SALON OWNERS HAVE LOST OR SALON STYLISTS HAVE LOST DURING THIS PANDEMIC. I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO APPLY FOR P. P. P. LOANS AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT JUST TO HAVE THEIR ABILITY NOT TO MAKE MONEY AND NOT TO EMPLOY THE ALMOST TWO MILLION IF NOT MORE. RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES AND FOOD SERVICE WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S JUST. SO SAD. AND SO WHILE I HAVE SUPPORT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I THINK IT'S A VERY MODEST STEP. TO IT'S A VERY MODEST STEP. TO HELP SOME OF OUR RESTAURANT OWNERS IT'S BY FAR DOES NOT GO AND NEARLY FAR ENOUGH THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING CENTER PAM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS- I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT- THIS UP THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS ONLY ONE OF A SERIES OF BILLS- THAT- WE ARE DOING TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES- AND CERTAINLY NOT THE LARGEST OF THEM ALL BUT- I DO APPRECIATE THAT- WE ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES EVEN FOR THE SMALLER THINGS LIKE WE ARE DOING THIS PARTICULAR BILL THE RECOGNIZING THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE LICENSES THAT- BY THE WAY WE DO NEED WE DO USE THAT REVENUE TO MAINTAIN THE TYPE OF STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE- FOR THOSE BUSINESS BUT RECOGNIZING THAT. SAYS THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE THAT PERHAPS IT'S NOT FAIR THAT WE CONTINUE TO BURDEN THEM WITH THIS EXPENSES EVEN IF THEY ARE SMALL COMPARISON TO THE TOTAL LOSSES BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE MANY OTHER BILLS AS WELL THAT WE ARE BOTH PASSING TODAY AND WILL IN THE FUTURE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE AND OF COURSE CALLING ON THE- APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN MANY DELAYS- FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS ACTUALLY IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

SENATE BILL EIGHTY SEVEN BY SENATOR CABALLERO AND ACTUALLY DID A SMALL BUSINESSES AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY DAHLE RELATED TO THE BUDGETS. SORRY ABOUT THAT SENATE CAREER ON TRYING TO GIVE YOUR BILL AWAY PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT S. B. O. S. B. EIGHTY SEVEN THIS AFTERNOON THE BILL THAT PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO SERVICE THE ECONOMIC ENGINES OF OUR STATE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR PRO TEM FOR HER CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL CO AUTHORS OF THE BILL AND THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS VISION TO CREATE THIS PROGRAM WHICH THIS BILL EXPANDS. DURING THE PANDEMIC SOMETHING REALLY REMARKABLE TO PLACE SMALL BUSINESSES MANY OF WHOM WERE HURT AND STRUGGLING THEMSELVES BEGAN STEPPING UP TO HELP OTHERS BUSINESSES LIKE RILEY'S BREWING COMPANY AND MADERA CONVERTED THEIR OPERATIONS TO PRODUCE HAND SANITIZER AND DISINFECTANT. GREATLY HELPING FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT BATTLING TO CONTAIN THE VIRUS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC OR RESTAURANTS LIKE THE BLUE FLAME DINER IN FIREBAUGH AND THAT BE TRUE CAFE AND HOLLISTER. THE PARTCIPATED IN THE GRADE PLATES DELIVERED PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT ARE VULNERABLE SENIORS RECEIVED THREE NUTRITIOUS MEALS A DAY DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO THEIR HOMES. JUST AS WE HAVE RELIED ON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES TO SERVE THOSE MEALS OR PER COFFEE IT IS NOW TIME FOR THE STATE TO STEP STEP UP TO SUPPORT. THEM AND THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WORK IN THIS IN THESE BUSINESSES TO PUT FOOD ON THEIR OWN TABLES. SB EIGHTY SEVEN FORMALLY ESTABLISHES AND EXPANDS THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS COBIT NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM THAT THE GOVERNOR CREATED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER TWO MONTHS AGO. THIS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE GRANTS OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFIT MISSION SERVICES. WITH UP TO TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE AND ELIGIBLE NONPROFIT CULTURE- INSTITUTION. SUCH AS SOON. MUSE AND PERFORMING ARTS COMPANIES. SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE DURING THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS. RECENT DATA INDICATES A CLOSE TO ONE THIRD OF SMALL BUSINESSES WILL NOT SURVIVE BEYOND THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS. NONPROFITS I'VE ALSO BEEN ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS THEIR RESOURCES AND FINANCES HAVE DECLINED WHILE THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES HAS INCREASED. SMALL BUSINESSES PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S THREE TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY. BUSINESSES WITH LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES MAKE UP ALMOST 90% OF THE BUSINESSES. AND THOSE WITH LESS THAN A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES REPRESENT 97% OF BUSINESSES IN THE STATE. AND AS OF NOVEMBER SMALL BUSINESS REVENUE IS DOWN THIRTY THREE PERCENT. THIS BILL APPROPRIATES JUST OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THE PROGRAM INCLUDING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO NONPROFIT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. THE GRANTS WILL BE ALLOCATED ACROSS AT LEAST FOUR ROUNDS ONE CLOSE AROUND USING THE EXISTENCE APPLICANTS FROM ROUND ONE AND TWO OF THE PREVIOUS CODE NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM. ONE ROUND FOR ELIGIBLE NONPROFIT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND AT LEAST TWO NEW OPEN ROUND FOR QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES. THE GRANT AMOUNTS VARY BASED ON ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE. ELIGIBLE USES FOR THE GRANT INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT ARE NOT LIMITED TO EMPLOYEE PAYROLL COSTS OR BENEFITS WORKING OVERHEAD SUCH AS RENT AND UTILITY PAYMENTS. COST ASSOCIATED WITH RE OPENING PLANTS AND OTHER COVERAGE COBIT RELATED EXPENSES. WE KNOW THAT OUR BUSINESSES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE ECONOMIC ROAD TO RECOVERY FOR OUR STATE AND SO IT IS IMPERATIVE WE MOVED TO HELP THEM WITH SWIFT AND BOLD ACTION. UNDERSTANDABLY THE GRANTS IN THIS BILL ARE SMALL COMPARED TO THE CITY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE LOSSES ARE SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE SUFFERED AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME DISCUSSION. ABOUT THAT ON THE FLOOR TODAY. MORRIS'S WILL BE CREATED TO ENSURE THAT THEY REMAIN ABLE TO STAY AFLOAT HOWEVER SB EIGHTY SEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR CABALLERO MEMBERS ARE GOING TO MOVE TO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE US SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I JUST WANT TO PLUG THE HARD WORK THAT THE GOVERNOR SENATE AND ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP IS PUT INTO THIS MEASURE I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE BUDGET CHAIR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS AND EVERYONE ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. BILL I AM PROUD AND HONORED TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR OF SB EIGHTY SEVEN THIS IS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS JUST MENTIONED GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WE CAN SEE A RETURN TO NORMALCY JUST AROUND THE CORNER. BUT TOO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT RIGHT NOW. LIKE MY COLLEAGUES FROM BAKERSFIELD AND SALINAS I TOO HAVE HEARD FROM MANY MANY SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT. THAT ARE DISTRACTING TO STAY AFLOAT RIGHT NOW. WHETHER TERROR SALONS OR SOFTWARE COMPANIES OR COFFEE SHOPS AND BARS AND RESTAURANTS. MANY OF THEM HAVE HAD TO FACE CLOSING TEMPORARILY- THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO HOLD ON TO THEIR EMPLOYEES THIS PROVIDES A CRITICAL LIFELINE TO THEM THIS WILL HELP THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND THE GRANT SAY PROVIDES WILL HELP SMALL BUSINESSES STAY OPEN IT WILL HELP THEM PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES THIS WILL BE CRITICAL FOR KEEPING SMALL BUSINESSES ALIVE. UNTIL WE GET BACK TO NORMAL WE ALL KNOW THE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL AB ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND WE HAVE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED. ENDEMIC DRIVEN DOWNTURN- SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL WE'LL BE THAT LIFELINE AND I'M GRATEFUL TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR EMPHASIZING SMALL BUSINESSES AND ALSO NON PROFITS IN THIS BUDGET PACKAGE. I WANT TO JUST GIVE A QUICK SHOUT OUT TO THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS APPROPRIATED. IN THIS BILL. FOR CULTURE NON. MAY OF US AND- IN ORDER HAVE IMPORTANT PERFORMING ARTS AND MUSEUMS AND ART INSTITUTES AND THEY TOO ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. AND SO THIS IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL AS WELL SO I URGE YOU FOR MY VOTE I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORKING IN THIS YEAR BECAUSE BUDGET TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIND ADDITIONAL WAYS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN CENTER BORJAS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I GOTTA TELL YOU FOLKS THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING ITEMS I'VE EVER WORKED ON DURING MY TENURE IN THE SENATE. THAT IS WHY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL. TWO BILLION RELIEF FUNDS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS- THEY'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE COCA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IN pSB SEVENTY FOR THE KEEP CALIFORNIA WORKING ACT. WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS WHICH SOUGHT TO PROVIDE TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THE BILL I THINK. EARNED MORE SUPPORT THAN FOLKS IMAGINED YOU'D BE ABLE TO GARNER. THE BILL WAS CO AUTHORED BY THIRTY SIX DEMOCRATS IN TWENTY SEVEN REPUBLICANS IN BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. THAT IS MORE THAN HALF OF THE ENTIRE STATE LEGISLATURE. TWENTY FIVE SENATORS IN THIS ROOM- CO SPONSORED THIS BILL SB SEVENTY FOUR IN FOR THAT. I THANK YOU IT MEANT THE WORLD TO ME TO MY COLLEAGUES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY% TO THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE SUFFERED- DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THE BILL ALSO ATTRACTED SUPPORT FROM MORE THAN EIGHTY BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE MOMENTUM GENERATED BY S. B. SEVENTY FOUR DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR GREATER INVESTMENT HELP STRUGGLING SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THAT THE FISCAL AMOUNT OF SB SEVENTY FOUR HAS PROPERLY BEEN. ARE CONVERTED INTO S. B. EIGHTY SEVEN TO PROVIDE THIS MUCH NEEDED RELIEF ESPECIALLY ON AN EXPEDITED BASIS. I'D LIKE TO THANK US SENATOR FROM SALINAS ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM ORANGE COUNTY THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY OF COURSE TO SUPPORT THIS. AND RECOGNIZE THE STAFF WHO WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING SEVENTY FOUR HAPPEN THAT OPEN THE DOOR FOR EIGHTY SEVEN TO BE A REALITY ON WHICH WERE VOTING TODAY. JEFFREY RALPH OUR SALLY COOPER DAVE RAMIREZ A LISA RIVERA FROM CENTER COUPLE YEARS OFFICE. CLEAR CONLIN- LIZZY COULD SAUNA AND JESS WONG FROM ASSEMBLY WHEN CARDI PETRIE-NORRIS IS OFFICE. IN JULIE CELLS MAKING TO SUSAN M. BLAKE SANTEE FROM MY OFFICE. THIS HAS BEEN AN EXPERIENCE. BUT I BELIEVE WE SHOULD REPLICATE AS FREQUENTLY AS OFTEN AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. THIS WAS A MOMENT WHERE THIS BODY TRANSCENDED PARTISANSHIP. AND WE'VE SEEN HOW HYPER PARTISAN WASHINGTON CAN BE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT IMMUNE TO IT IN SACRAMENTO. BUT OUR CONSTITUENCIES WANT US TO DELIVER RESULTS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES DEMAND THESE RESULTS. THAT IS WHY SB EIGHTY SEVEN IS SO EXCITING IT ALSO BROUGHT TO MIND SOMETHING THAT OUR FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR SAID- PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT A PERSON CAN DO. OR WHERE THEY CAN GO. IF THEY DON'T MIND WHO GETS THE CREDIT. COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND PLEASE LET'S VOTE HI SB. EIGHTY SEVEN. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO STAND AS A PROD CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR PROTEOME OUR BUDGET YEAR AND THE INCREDIBLE STAFF THAT HAS WORKED- TO GET THIS MEASURE TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY OTHERS NO DOUBT WE ALL KNOW THE SMALL BUSINESSES THE LIFE BLOOD OF OUR ECONOMY OVER 60% OF ALL EMPLOYEES WORK FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. SO THAT'S WHY I SAY THEY ARE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE MOST DESERVING OF THIS RELIEF AND IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AT THIS CRITICAL TIME. I WANT TO OFFER ALSO EMPHASIZED IN MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE CAN'T GO BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL AND OVERLOOKED SMALL BUSINESSES AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED IS WHAT MINORITIES. HAVE KNOWN HISTORICALLY. THAT MINORITY OWNED AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT OTHER BUSINESSES TAKE FOR GRANTED. THE SAME CAPITALIN PROGRAMS THAT THEY USE TO SURVIVE AND GROW THEIR BUSINESS. AND THIS IS STILL THE CASE TODAY WHEN IT COMES TO MINORITIES BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THIS. CREDIT AND LOANS FOR THEIR BUSINESSES BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC A STANFORD STUDY FOUND THAT 1% OF MINORITY BUSINESS OBTAIN LOANS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR COMPARED TO OVER 7% WHITE OWNED BUSINESSES. THIS SPREAD THEM BECAUSE ALL THE ONLY EXACERBATED THAT PROBLEM THAT HAS EXISTED FOR YEARS LAST YEAR FEDERAL RESERVE FOUND THAT 70% OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WERE TIGHTENING THEIR LENDING STANDARDS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT IS WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS SO ESSENTIAL AT THIS TIME AND WHY URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. WE NEED MORE THAN WHAT IS DONE TODAY THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP AND WHAT IS SO CRITICALLY NEEDED TO KEEP THESE BUSINESSES AFLOAT. IF WE ARE TO LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES OF THE GREAT RECESSION WE MUST GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES TO RESEARCH THEY NEED TO GROW. OUT OF THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WE CAN'T GO BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. FOR MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES WERE FORCED TO OPERATE AT A SERIOUS FINANCIAL DISADVANTAGE I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND WE BUILD UPON WHAT THIS LEGISLATION THE GOVERNOR HAS DONE. IN IN IN IN IN IN PROVIDING HELP FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND I HOPE IT CHIEF. LONG LASTING AND POSITIVE IMPACTS TO UNDERSERVED MINORITY COMMUNITIES I STRONGLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'VE AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE TODAY I ALSO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT IN A PROUD AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE I WANT TO THANK THEM. MY COLLEAGUE FROM CITY NOT. LEADERSHIP AND EVERYONE HERE IN THE SENATE FOR THIS MEASURE. THIS ISSUE IS GETTING CLOSER AND MORE PERSONAL EACH AND EVERY DAY THAT THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES. I WANT TO SHARE THAT SO MANY OF MY FORMER STUDENTS CALL ME DESPERATELY. PLEADING FOR ME TO HELP THEM MOST RECENTLY ONE STUDENTS THAT THEIR PARENTS HAVE LOST THEIR- CATERING BUSINESS. ASKED DURING A PANDEMIC THEY COULDN'T. GO OUT AND SERVICE PEOPLE. SO AGAIN WHEN WE HEAR THESE CRIES FOR HELP I THINK THIS MEASURE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND I HEARD ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SAY THAT ONE THIRD OF BUSINESSES WILL NOT SURVIVE. WE NEED TO DO BETTER. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM GUARDINO STATED. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO OVERLOOK. BUSINESSES AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES. I HEARD YOU KNOW RECENTLY MY FORMER OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM- THAT'S A CENTRAL VALLEY TALK ABOUT. WOMEN SINGLE WOMEN MINORITY WOMEN AGAIN BUSINESS CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THESE VEHICLES THAT HELPS OUR COMMUNITIES STAY AFLOAT PROVIDE THE TAX REVENUE THAT OUR LOCAL CITIES NEED. AND SO I'M SO PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND I HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE SMALL BUSINESSES SO THEY STAY A FLOAT. AND IT'S EVEN HARDER TIMES THESE ARE THE ONES THAT STEP UP. AND ARE FEEDING PEOPLE GIVING FREE MEALS TAKING FEMALES TO OUR SENIORS SO WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND THE AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER RUBY CENTER DRAWS. SHARE I ALSO RISE SUPPORT SB EIGHT SEVEN AND I THANK THE AUTHOR IN OUR LEADERSHIP OFFER MOVING THIS FORWARD AND THE GOVERNOR AS WELL- THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES OWNED BY IMMIGRANTS IN MY DISTRICT FROM. KOREATOWN TO BOYLE HEIGHTS TO CHINATOWN- AND- SO THERE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEN WITHIN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY THERE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT FAMILIAR THAT ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH ENGAGING IN THIS AND ASKING FOR THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND THAT OTHERS- GET- SO I REALLY HOPE AND MAYBE I COULD ASK THE QUESTION. MADAM CHAIR QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR CERTAINLY THANK YOU JUST WANT TO ASK A QUESTION THE AUTHOR IS GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OR A SENSE OF HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ASSISTANCE THAT'S SO BADLY NEEDED ESPECIALLY. WITHIN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES OR- BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR AND NOT COMFORTABLE- WITH PARTICIPATING IN AND THE GOVERNMENT PROCESS THIS WAY WHAT CAN WE DO OR WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE SURE IT GETS TO THEM AS WELL THANK YOU SENATE CABALLERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MATTER PRESIDENT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION SO ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN THIS PROGRAM IS THAT. THE THE CONTRACTOR WHO IS L'INDUSTRIE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS AND- PARTNERS IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY THAT ARE- PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO- THOSE PARTNERS HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN GETTING OUT THE WORD ABOUT THE PROGRAM BUT WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE- DO THE GRASS ROOTS. BOB CONTACT WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS I HAVE TWENTY SEVEN CITIES AND IN MY DISTRICT AND I'VE WEARING CAN IN CONTRACT WOULD HAVE A IN CONTACT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A- A VIRTUAL. AND WE'RE GOING TO USE A- THAT CAN BE UTILIZED TO PASS OUT EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS WITHIN A BUSINESS OWNER. SO THAT WE CAN GET TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WITH ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON HOW THEY THEY CAN ACCESS THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE GRASSROOTS EFFORTS GOING OUT THERE AND WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH OUR OWN OFFICES BUT ALSO THROUGH THE- THAT BOX UNDER CONTRACTED CDFI IS AND- BUT BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE HAVE AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ARE SOME. BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED TO ANY KIND OF FORMAL INSTITUTION AND IT'S GOING TO BE IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET THE WORD OUT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT WE ALSO HAVE. IN ANOTHER BUDGET ISSUE THAT THAT'LL COME UP LATER IN THE YEAR WE HAVE A- MICRO BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM IN THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THE SELF EMPLOYED VERY VERY SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THAT'LL BE A DIFFERENT ON A DIFFERENT PLATFORM IN A DIFFERENT OUT REGION SO LET'S STAY IN TOUCH SO WE CAN. CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE REACH REAL DEEP INTO THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT'S OUR GOAL. THANK YOU SARAH CABALLERO THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS THEM SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TODAY I STAND AS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF SB EIGHTY SEVEN AND I WANT TO COMMEND EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM FOR THIS EFFORT I'M SOMEBODY THAT BELIEVES A BIPARTISAN POLICIES LEAD TO THE BEST SOLUTIONS THEY'RE BETTER AND THEY'RE LONGER LASTING AND THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF COURSE I'D BE REMISS WITHOUT MENTIONING THAT SB SEVENTY FOUR. BY MY FRIEND FROM FRESNO SPONDE THIS- SB EIGHTY SEVEN THAT WE'RE TO BE SUPPORTING TODAY SO WITH HIS VISION AND HARD WORK ALONG WITH- THE FINE SENATOR FROM SALINAS WHILE WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE TO BUILD A COALITION NECESSARY. TO BRING HAVE THIS RIGHT UP TO THE TOP. ASSEMBLY IMPORTANT ALSO WHEN IT KNOWLEDGE INTAKE- THE PRO TEM AND HER STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK AND NEGOTIATING THE FINAL DETAILS WITH THE GOVERNOR. AND AS MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM IS ALREADY MENTIONED THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. BUT IT'S A START. AND IT'S A GREAT START BECAUSE IT WAS DONE WORKING TOGETHER IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER WHICH IS WHAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA EXPECT FROM US. SO WITH THAT. I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A UNANIMOUS VOTE TODAY WHICH ISN'T IT'S GOOD THING BUT THIS IS JUST A FIRST STEP. AND I AGAIN ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WILK CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IS A GREAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION I AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WORK WITH A LOT OF OTHER SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND- NOT SEE OR SHARE WITH YOU THAT. THE STORIES WE'VE ALL HEARD AND OUR NEIGHBORS IN THOSE THOSE WHO HAVE CAME HERE AND STARTED BUSINESS AND WE HEARD ABOUT THE IMMIGRANTS THEY'RE LIVING THEIR% DREAM AND THE SWEAT EQUITY THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR BUSINESSES. IT IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE AND THE PAIN THAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH OUR EMPLOYEES I COMMEND THE IPARTISANSHIP AND THE WORK. AND I WANT TO JUST. MANSION THAT THE YOU KNOW THE PRO TEM SAID TODAY THAT THIS IS A STARTING POINT WE'RE WORKING ON ALL THESE BILLS. TO TRY TO HELP OUT CALIFORNIANS AYE. I JUST WANT TO THANK GOD THAT WE HAVE. MEGAN A WORLDWIDE CORPORATIONS IN OUR STATE THAT ARE. CREATING THIS TAX BASE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE AVAILABLE TO US. TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW. BUT LONG TERM. YOU KNOW THIS IS A SHOT NORM. WE CANNOT CONTINUE FOREVER TO BE ABLE TO. PUT OUT THESE FIRES EVEN FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE ARE PRINTING. OR CREATING MONEY. THAT HAS NO BACKWARDS YOU GONNA SEE INFLATION. LIKE WE'VE NEVER SEEN IN MY OPINION BECAUSE WE'RE INFUSING SO MUCH. THAT CASH INTO OUR SYSTEM. SO THE REAL LONG. THE REAL LONG TERM PROJECTS FOR. THIS BODY IN IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR IS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN GET OUR BUSINESSES BACK GOING SAFELY. AND ACTUALLY LET THEM SUSTAIN AND BILL WILL NOT HAVE TO RELY ON- THESE FUNDS THAT ARE COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND US BUT FOR NOW. I KNOW WE MUST DO THIS. BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO. GET THE SMALL BUSINESSES THEY ARE THE BACKBONE. OF CALIFORNIA- AND OUR NATION- BACK ON THEIR FEET ACTUALLY OPERATING WITH WITHOUT HAVING TO USE ASSISTANCE SO AGAIN I APPLAUD. THE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU ENERGEN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY SEVEN AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO FOR HIS VISION AND LEADERSHIP. INCLUDING THIS- PROCESS STARTING THIS PROCESS LAST YEAR- I THINK I'D LIKE TO THINK YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE TO THINK SENATE PRO TEM FOR MAKING SURE THAT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION- ME TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOVERNOR. SO THAT THIS THIS RELIEF WHICH IS MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN THE LICENSE FEE WILL BE ABLE TO- WE CAN OFFER IT TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN STRUGGLING OVER THIS LAST YEAR DURING THE CODE LOCKED DOWN. OBVIOUSLY I'D LIKE TO THINK- MY COLLEAGUE AND SENATOR CAFIERO FOR HER INPUT ON THIS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OFTEN FEEL LEFT OUT AND WHEN LEGISLATION IS PASSED IT TENDS TO BENEFIT SOME OF OUR LARGER REGIONS. AND I JUST APPLAUD THE SENATOR FROM SENATOR CAFIERO FROM AND FROM THE MADERA MID MERCED AREA. TO YOU AND JOIN US IN THIS FIGHT TO RECOGNIZE IT AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHEN WE STICK TOGETHER GOOD PIECES OF LEGISLATION CAN HAPPEN. I KNOW ALL OF YOU- HAVE RESTAURANTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUFFERING INSIDE YOUR DISTRICTS. AND THIS IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BUSINESSES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO AND HELP. ELIMINATE SOME OF THE LOS THAT THEY FACED OVER THE LAST YEAR SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU CENTER GROW MEMBERS. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. C. AND HEARING THEM SENATE. MY CLOTHES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS THAT- SPOKE TODAY ON THE FLOOR. THIS IS REALLY BEEN A TEAM EFFORT AND I WANT TO THANK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU FOR SIGNING ON. EARLY ON TO SB SEVENTY FOUR AS WELL AS SIGNING ON TO. THIS BUSY BILL AS WELL WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU AND QUITE FRANKLY I THINK. ON ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS AND YOUR SECURE SIGNATURES MAKE THE MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN- CREATING A TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR- PACKAGE IN THE END THAT'S WHAT IT. IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE- THIS AS I SAID IT'S BEEN A TEAM EFFORT SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE RECOGNIZED THE STAFF AND I WANT TO THANK GOD. MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SENATOR FROM FRESNO FOR DOING THAT- WE COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN TO THIS POINT THIS QUICKLY. WITHOUT THEIR EFFORTS ON. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HEAR ME LOUD AND CLEAR HOW HOW THANKFUL I AM- BUT LET ME LET ME JUST SAY THAT THIS REALLY IS THE FIRST STEP. AND WE'RE TAKING A NUMBER OF STEPS BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE AN ECONOMIC. ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND OVER THE NEXT BUT THIS UPCOMING YEAR. I EXPECT THAT WE'LL SEE SOME BILLS START TO PUT NEW REGULATIONS OR NEW REQUIREMENTS ON SMALL BUSINESSES. WHEN I ASK YOU TO THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE WE- TAKE THOSE STEPS BECAUSE- THEY'RE HURTING AND THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW AND I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE WE- WE- WE SEE THEM ON A STRONG FOOTING. ARE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO OPERATE AND START TO CREATE THE- ECONOMIC. A THAT'S NAY TO BE ABLE TO BRING PEOPLE BACK SO THAT THEY CAN START WORKING. AND IF WE CAN DO THAT THEN WILL WILL HAVE ACHIEVED WHAT WE WANTED WE ACHIEVE WHICH IS THAT. WOULD HELP WILL HAVE OUR ECONOMY BACK WILL HAVE THE REVENUE COMING AND WILL HAVE PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO.
