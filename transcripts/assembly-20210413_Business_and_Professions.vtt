01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:56.878
FORTY NINE STATES HAVE GOTTEN

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:58.647
IT WRONG. AND EVEN THE GOVERNOR

01:21:58.713 --> 01:22:02.751
HAS SAID. QUOTE WE'RE ALL

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:04.552
GENIUSES IN HINDSIGHT. THE

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.388
PUTTING ALL THAT ASIDE. EVEN IF

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.023
YOU ARE OF THE MIND THAT THE

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:09.824
STATE HAS GOTTEN EVERYTHING

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:11.893
EXACTLY RIGHT. AND ANY

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.428
ESTABLISHMENT THAT WAS AT ANY

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:15.563
POINT OUT OF COMPLIANCE WAS IN

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:17.966
THE WRONG I STILL THINK THIS IS

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:20.268
A BILL WE SHOULD ALL SUPPORT.

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:21.636
TO ESTABLISH THE VERY IMPORTANT

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:23.872
PRINCIPLE.AGAIN THAT COVERT

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:26.074
ERA PUNISHMENTS SHOULD NOT BE

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:27.742
EXTENDED. BEYOND THE COVERED

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:30.378
AREA. THE QUESTION IS ADDS OUR

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:33.148
ECONOMY REOPENS IS OUR APPROACH

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:36.584
GOING TO BE PUNITIVE AND PETTY

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:38.987
OR FOR GIVING AND CONSTRUCTIVE.

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.288
WE FOCUS ON RETRIBUTION AND

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:43.825
RETALIATION OR ON RESTORATION

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:47.095
AND REVITALIZATION. MY BELIEF

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:48.963
IS THAT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:51.366
SETTLE SCORES IT IS TIME FOR A

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:52.567
MOVE EVERY OBSTACLE TO

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:53.968
RESTORING THE LIFE OF OUR

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:56.171
COMMUNITIES AND THE LIVELIHOODS

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:57.739
OF OUR PEOPLE THERE IS NO PLACE

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.709
FOR SPITE CERTAINLY NOT SPITE

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:01.309
BACKED. BY THE FORCE OF STATE

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:04.312
POWER. THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:06.314
FIFTY FOUR. INSURERS THAT THE

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:08.850
DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:09.384
AND DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOL

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:11.219
BEVERAGE CONTROL. CANNOT

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:13.321
RESERVE REVOKE A LICENSE FOR

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:15.757
FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COVERT

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.292
NINETEEN A MERCHANT'S YOURS.

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.760
UNLESS IT CAN BE PROVEN THAT A

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:22.130
LACK OF COMPLIANCE. CONTRIBUTED

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:24.332
TO THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN.

01:23:24.399 --> 01:23:25.633
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.769
UNDERSTAND THIS PROPOSAL. IN

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.572
THE CONTEXT OF. WHAT OUR SMALL

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:31.139
BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS GONE

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.907
THROUGH. SMALL BUSINESSES

01:23:32.974 --> 01:23:34.409
COMPRISE ROUGHLY HALF OF

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:35.977
CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE THAT WAS

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:37.579
BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:40.048
PANDEMIC. AND STATE DATA

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:42.183
RELEASED LAST AUGUST SURE THE

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.852
CLOSE TO HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:46.020
SMALL BUSINESSES WERE AT RISK

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:46.654
OF SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE OF THE

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:48.623
PANDEMIC. MINORITY OWNED

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:49.457
ESTABLISHMENTS WERE

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:51.292
DISPROPORTIONATELY AND AFFECTED

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:52.560
THE SURVEY CONCLUDED WITH A

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:53.728
NUMBER OF BUSINESSES OWNED BY

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:55.130
AFRICAN AMERICANS DROPPED ABOUT

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:57.399
DROPPING BY 41% LATINO OWNED

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.734
BUSINESSES BY 32% IN ASIAN

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:00.969
OWNED BUSINESSES BY TWENTY FIVE

01:24:01.035 --> 01:24:03.772
PERCENT. ROUGHLY 36% OF

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.507
IMMIGRANT OWNED BUSINESSES WENT

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:07.642
UNDER AS ONE EXAMPLE TAKE THE

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.544
RESTAURANT INDUSTRY LAST AUGUST

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:10.645
ASIDE FROM THE THOUSANDS OF

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:11.946
RESTAURANTS THAT ALREADY GONE

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:14.048
OUT OF BUSINESS 30% SAID THEY

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:14.516
WOULD EITHER LOSE THE

01:24:14.582 --> 01:24:16.050
RESTAURANTS PERMANENTLY WILL BE

01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:18.520
REQUIRED TO DOWNSIZE.

01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:20.355
OPERATIONS THIS WAS IN EFFECT

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:21.656
NOT JUST OF THE PANDEMIC

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:24.526
ITSELF. BUT OF COVERT NINETEEN

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:25.093
RESTRICTIONS THE WERE OFTEN

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.061
UNCLEAR. AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:30.165
CHANGING. AS A RESULT MANY

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.466
BUSINESSES IN ONE WAY OR

01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:33.168
ANOTHER AT ONE POINT OR

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:35.203
ANOTHER. WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:36.805
WITH THE STATE'S MANDATES.

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.339
SOMETIMES THIS IS BECAUSE THEY

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:39.941
WERE SIMPLY UNAWARE OF WHAT THE

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.776
MANDATES OR UNAWARE THAT THEY

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:44.012
WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. AT

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:44.612
OTHER TIMES THERE WAS A GOOD

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:47.182
FAITH DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:48.149
ESTABLISHMENT AND THE

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:49.918
AUTHORITIES AS TO WHETHER THEY

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:51.619
WERE IN COMPLIANCE AND IN OTHER

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:53.621
OCCASIONS. YOU ESTABLISHMENTS

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:56.324
WERE FORCED. THAT HAVE FACED AN

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:57.692
IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE. WHETHER TO

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.327
OBEY MANDATES THAT DIDN'T EXIST

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:00.795
IN ANY OTHER STATE AND CLEARLY

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:02.897
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY GOOD. OR

01:25:02.964 --> 01:25:04.399
WHETHER TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:08.269
FAMILIES. AND THEIR EMPLOYEES.

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.638
TO REJECT THIS BILL IS TO SAY

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:11.573
WE'RE GOING TO PROLONG

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:13.541
SUFFERING BEYOND THE LIFE OF

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.710
THE VIRUS. AND I JUST DON'T

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:18.313
THINK THAT'S RIGHT. AND I THINK

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:18.913
THERE ARE SEVERAL ADDITIONAL

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:21.382
REASONS WHY WE SHOULDN'T EXTEND

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:23.485
COBRA ERA PENALTIES. BE ON THE

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.386
COVERED AREA THE FIRST IS THAT

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:27.155
WOULD BE A DEPARTURE FROM OUR

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:30.658
CURRENT AND PAST PRACTICES.

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:32.961
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE CAMPUS WHEN

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:34.696
THIS STATE DECIDED TO REAL

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:37.632
LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL CANNABIS

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:39.534
WE DIDN'T SAY WELL FOR FOLKS

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:41.903
THAT IN THE PAST WERE CONVICTED

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:44.072
OF CANNABIS POSSESSION WE'RE

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:45.306
STILL GOING TO CONSIDER YOU A

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:48.009
CRIMINAL BECAUSE YOU NEWS

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:49.711
AGAINST THE LAW AT THAT TIME

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.546
AND YOU CHOSE TO USE IT ANYWAY.

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:53.314
NOW WHAT WE DID IS WE SAID NOW

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:54.249
WE'RE NO LONGER GOING TO

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.817
CONSIDER YOU CRIMINALS WE'RE

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:59.087
GOING TO HAVE A CLEAN SLATE AND

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:00.121
LIKE THOSE CONVICTIONS CLEAN.

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:02.156
IN THE SAME VEIN NOW THAT

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:03.691
BUSINESSES ARE ALLOWED TO BE

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:05.627
OPEN OR GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:07.495
BE OPEN. WE SHOULDN'T SAY WE'RE

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:09.264
STILL GOING TO PUNISH YOU. FOR

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.466
BEING OPEN IN THE PAST. WHEN

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:14.269
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE. THE

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.603
SECOND ADDITIONAL REASON TO

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:18.473
SUPPORT THIS BILL. IS THAT IF

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.042
WE PURSUE THE PATH OF A LICENSE

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:22.510
REVOCATION OF KEEPING

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.345
BUSINESSES CLOSED FOR PAST

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:26.881
PRACTICES IT WILL FAVOR LARGE

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.716
CORPORATIONS OVER THE SMALL

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:30.919
BUSINESS COMMUNITY. BIG

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:32.453
COMPANIES HAVE HAD BIG

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.188
COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE

01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:36.024
ABLE TO PROVIDE STATE BY STATE

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:38.026
GUIDANCE ON EXACTLY WHAT THEIR

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:40.061
FRANCHISES NEED TO DO- YOU KNOW

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:41.930
THEY'VE HAD- THEY'VE BEEN DOING

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:44.832
BY- I THRIVING STOCK MARKET AND

01:26:44.899 --> 01:26:46.968
THEY HAVE. A LARGE MARGINS AND

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:50.505
RESOURCES. TO ABSORB THE COST

01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:51.940
OF SHUTDOWNS THAT SIMPLY AREN'T

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:53.708
AVAILABLE TO SMALL BUSINESSES

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:55.276
AND IF THE GOVERNMENT NOW

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:57.278
ITSELF CAUSES ADDITIONAL SMALL

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:59.480
BUSINESSES TO CLOSE. IT IS ONLY

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:02.650
GONNA- ADVANTAGE THESE LARGE

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:04.385
COMPANIES EVEN MORE. THE THIRD

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:05.853
POINT I'D RAISE IS THAT THE

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.089
PROPOSAL THE PRINCIPLE THAT IS

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:10.124
IN THIS BILL IS IN THE INTEREST

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:11.159
OF PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE WHAT

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:12.894
IT SAYS. IS THAT OUR STATE

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:14.495
AGENCIES SHOULD FOCUS THEIR

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:16.130
RESOURCES ON THOSE

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:16.798
ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ARE

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:18.433
ACTUALLY CREATING A PROBLEM SO

01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:19.734
THERE'S STILL THE OPPORTUNITY

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:21.936
IT REPLACES PURSUE SANCTIONS

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:22.570
BUT ONLY IF IT CAN BE

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:24.539
DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE'S BEEN

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:25.840
AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PUBLIC

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.775
HEALTH. I THINK THAT ACTUALLY

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:29.544
WOULD GO A LOT FARTHER TOWARDS

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:30.778
CURBING TRANSMISSION OF THE

01:27:30.845 --> 01:27:32.780
VIRUS THAT HAVING STATE

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:34.082
BUREAUCRATS GOING AROUND

01:27:34.148 --> 01:27:35.016
SEARCHING FOR TECHNICAL

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:37.352
VIOLATIONS OR TARGETING

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:38.653
BUSINESSES THAT PERHAPS THE

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.855
MOST OUTSPOKEN- OR OFTENTIMES

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.023
YOU KNOW THESE ESTABLISHMENTS

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.691
OR- POLITICALLY DISFAVORED OR

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:45.393
JUST END UP BEING UNLUCKY. AND

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.061
THE FINAL POINT I'D RAISE IS

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:48.229
THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:50.465
POSTAL FOR RESTORING TRUST

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:51.366
THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:53.034
DISTRUST BRED THROUGHOUT THE

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:57.038
STATE- BY THE OFTEN EXISTENTIAL

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.307
RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE IMPOSED.

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:01.542
AND I THINK THAT THIS GESTURE

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:04.245
OF GOODWILL. WOULD REALLY GO A

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:05.780
LONG WAY. I WANT TO TAKE JUST A

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:09.617
MOMENT- IF YOU WILL TO ADDRESS.

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:11.085
A COUPLE ARGUMENTS THAT I'VE

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:11.619
HEARD RAISED AGAINST THIS

01:28:11.686 --> 01:28:14.489
PROPOSAL. NOW THERE'S ALWAYS

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:16.224
THIS IDEA OF DETERRENCE THAT WE

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:17.325
NEED TO HAVE THESE PENALTIES

01:28:17.392 --> 01:28:18.626
THERE IS A DETERRENT BUT THAT

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:20.595
SIMPLY DOESN'T APPLY TO THIS

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:21.896
SITUATION. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.831
GONNA- WHAT WE'RE GONNA ASK

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:25.700
THESE COMPANIES THAT IS

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:26.868
BUSINESSES TO BEHAVE BETTER THE

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.603
NEXT TIME A ONCE IN A CENTURY

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:30.204
PANDEMIC COMES AROUND THIS IS

01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:32.607
REALLY SOMETHING- THAT- YOU

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:34.909
KNOW IS. IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:35.443
IS GOING TO BE A RECURRING

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.578
PHENOMENON. AB SECOND THING A

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:38.980
POINT THAT'S ARGUMENTS AND

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.481
REYES IS THAT THERE IS- IT'S

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.483
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY PROVE.

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:44.252
THAT BUSINESS WAS A CAUSE OF

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:44.852
TRANSMISSION BUT I THINK THAT

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:47.021
THAT VERY ARGUMENT IS A REASON

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:48.389
WHY WE SHOULD DOPT THIS BILL

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:50.591
ISN'T IS EVIDENCE ITSELF- THAT

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.593
THE STATE HAS NOT BEEN PURSUING

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.128
SANCTIONS IN A WAY THAT'S

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:55.163
GUIDED BY PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:57.031
WE WERE REALLY CONCERNED. WITH

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.700
STOPPING BUSINESS ACTIVITY THAT

01:28:58.766 --> 01:29:00.735
CONTRIBUTES TO TRANSMISSION THE

01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:01.703
STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO

01:29:01.769 --> 01:29:02.804
DEVELOP A CONTACT RAISING

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:06.007
SPECIAL TOOLS BY WHICH THAT

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:06.941
COULD BE DEMONSTRATED. BUT MAIN

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:07.975
ARGUMENT I HEARD AGAINST THIS

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:10.578
IDEA. IS THAT. IT'S SOMEHOW

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:12.146
REWARDING BAD BEHAVIOR IT'S

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:14.816
UNFAIR TO TREAT THE SAME-

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:16.317
BUSINESSES THAT DECIDED TO OBEY

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.319
THE ORDERS AND STAY CLOSED. AND

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:21.456
THOSE THAT DECIDED. TO OPEN. I

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:23.091
POINT OUT FIRST OF ALL THAT

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:24.859
EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT.

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.360
THAT'S STILL NO REASON TO

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:29.163
PURSUE THE NUCLEAR OPTION OF AN

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:30.832
OF A LICENSE REVOCATION. I'D

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:31.766
CERTAINLY POINT OUT THAT THIS

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:34.268
IS AGAIN A DEPARTURE FROM LET'S

01:29:34.335 --> 01:29:35.103
SAY THE WAY WE'VE TREATED

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:36.938
CANNABIS WHERE YOU MIGHT

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:38.639
SIMILARLY REYES THE POINT WELL

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:39.540
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:41.075
WANTED TO USE CANNABIS WHEN IT

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:42.143
WAS ILLEGAL BUT THEY OBEY THE

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.878
LAW. AND SO NOW WE'RE TREATING

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:46.247
THEM THE SAME AS THE PEOPLE WHO

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:48.082
DID CHOOSE TO OBEY THE LAW. BY

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:50.518
THE SAME REASONING. THE SAME

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:52.587
REASONING WOULD APPLY HERE. THE

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:54.188
FINAL POINT I WANT TO RAISE IS

01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:55.256
THAT THE WAY THINGS ARE BEING

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:56.924
DONE RIGHT NOW IF WE PROCEED

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:58.960
WITH THESE LICENSE REVOCATIONS

01:29:59.026 --> 01:30:00.895
FOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.997
THERE'S A MUCH GREATER- THERE'S

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:05.566
A MUCH MORE PERVERSE IN EQUITY.

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:07.101
WHICH IS TO SAY THAT BUSINESSES

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:08.836
THAT OPEN SAFELY ARE TREATED

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.872
THE SAME WAY AS BUSINESSES THAT

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:13.107
OPENED RECKLESSLY SO YOU COULD

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:14.509
HAVE HAD A BUSINESS THAT

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:15.676
DECIDED TO OPEN AND DID

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:16.644
EVERYTHING IT COULD TO MAKE

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.446
THINGS SAFE AND ELIMINATE ANY

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:20.014
REAL RISK OF TRANSMISSION YOU

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:22.750
KNOW THEY I. INSISTED ON MASKS

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:24.218
THEY PUT UP THOSE PLASTIC

01:30:24.285 --> 01:30:26.120
DIVIDER THINGS- THEY DIDN'T

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:27.855
DEEP CLEANINGS EVEN THOUGH THE

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:29.891
CDC NOW SAYS THAT THAT. WAS

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.392
KIND OF POINTLESS MANY OF

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:32.827
ANOTHER BUSINESS THAT DECIDED

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:33.961
TO OPEN IT WAS COMPLETELY

01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:36.197
RECKLESS AND PACKED PEOPLE INTO

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.532
TO TAKE ORDERS YET UNDER THE

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:38.800
WAY THINGS ARE BEING DONE NOW

01:30:38.866 --> 01:30:40.001
THEY'RE TREATED EXACTLY THE

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:41.068
SAME DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE

01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:44.038
MISTER KIND YES I'M CLOSING

RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:46.107
AND SO I THINK THAT IF WE'RE

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.141
GONNA TALK ABOUT EQUITABLE

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:49.343
FRIEDMAN. THEN THAT ACTUALLY

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.712
WEIGHS IN FAVOR OF THE CRITERIA

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:53.281
SET FORTH IN THIS BILL. BUT IF

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:54.515
THE STATE'S GOING TO PURSUE

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:57.185
PUNITIVE ACTION. THEN THERE

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:59.053
SHOULD AT LEAST NEED TO BE A

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.189
BURDEN OF PROOF ON THE PART. OF

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:03.324
THE STATE AGENCY TO SHOW THAT

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:05.293
THERE WAS HARM DONE. AND SO

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:06.727
WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:08.629
