ISSUE NUMBER ONE A SECRETARY OF STATE. A VOTING SYSTEM REPLACEMENT FOR COUNTIES PLEASE PROCEED. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSON COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I'M SUSAN LAPSLEY DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE FIRST SECRETARY ALEX SEPARATE STATE ALEX PADILLA. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE SECTOR A STATE BUDGET ITEM WHICH PROVIDES A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF VOTING SYSTEMS FOR COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THIS BUDGET ALLOCATION. IS AN ESSENTIAL ENTIRELY INVESTMENT IN OUR DEMOCRACY AGING VOTING SYSTEMS ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS TODAY. THE VOTING TECHNOLOGY IN USE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S AT IS AT OR NEARING END OF LIFE ELECTION OFFICIALS IN THE STATE CANNOT GET REPLACEMENT PARTS. FOR ELECTION EQUIPMENT MANY OF THE SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONING ON OUT OF DATE OPERATING SYSTEMS WITH KNOWN SECURITY RISKS. THE DUE DILIGENCE AND UPKEEP AN OF KEEPING THESE AGING SYSTEMS LIKE DEDICATED ELECTION OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAS HELPED TO REDUCE THE RISK MANY OF THEM YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY. THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES INCLUDING THE STRICT. AND STRENUOUS TESTING THAT WE'VE DONE. BY THE STATE HAVE ALSO TO HELP MINIMIZE THIS RISK. BUT CALIFORNIA'S MODERNIZE OUR VOTING EQUIPMENT FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS THE URGENT NEED TO REPLACE OUR VOTING SYSTEMS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE. AS EARLY AS TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON ELECTION ADMINISTRATION ISSUED A REPORT. I HAD BEEN AND THE REPORTS. WARNED OF THE AGING EQUIPMENT AND THAT. THE BENCH. THE IMPENDING CRISIS IN VOTING TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS ABOUT TO HIT THE COUNTRY. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTEEN AND NEW YORK'S UNIVERSITIES UNIQUE NEW YORKERS OVERSEAS FRIENDS CENTER FOR JUSTICE ISSUED A REPORT THAT RAISE CONCERNS INCLUDING THE FAILURE OF EQUIPMENT. TO WORK AS INTENDED AND THE DIFFICULTY FINDING REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR MACHINES THEY'RE NO LONGER MANUFACTURED NO LONGER MANUFACTURED. AND JUST LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE REPORTED SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF AGING VOTING SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. I PERSONALLY CLEARLY REMEMBER THE TWO THOUSAND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE CONCLUDED WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT'S OF SETTLING THE BUSH V. GORE LEGAL BATTLE. HANGING CHADS AND BUTTERFLY BALLOTS THAT WAS MY FIRST ELECTION IS AHEAD OF ELECTIONS INVALID AND IT WAS QUITE STE. QUITE INTERESTING AND QUITE FUN WITH A LOT OF INTERESTING ISSUES. BUT MANY BELIEVE THAT THOSE ISSUES WERE CREATED BY THE AGING VOTING SYSTEMS AND FOR IN FLORIDA. IN RESPONSE TO THAT CONGRESS ACTED IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER TO PASS THE HELP AMERICA VOTE ACT THE PROVIDED FUNDING TO MODERNIZE VOTING SYSTEMS IN ALL FIFTY STATES. THAT SAME YEAR CALIFORNIAN LEGISLATURE PLACEPROP FORTY ONE ON THE TWO THOUSAND TWO BALLOT WHICH PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STATE VOTING SYSTEMS. THAT WAS MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND WE'RE BACK WHERE WE STARTED WITH AGING VOTING SYSTEMS THAT MAY FAIL. THE COUNTY VOTING MACHINES ARE FALLING APART INVENTORS NO LONGER MAKE REPLACEMENT PARTS COUNTIES TURN FREQUENTLY WHICH I'M SURE THEY'LL TELL YOU ABOUT. TO EBAY. AND LOOK FOR SCRAP PARTS FROM OTHER STATES TO KEEP THE MACHINES GOING. SOME COUNTIES OPERATE ON OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE SO OLD DEFENDER LONG LONG NO LONGER PROVIDES TECH SUPPORT MEANING SOME COUNTY. CALIFORNIA VOTING MACHINES CANNOT BE PATCH UPDATED WITH THE LATER CYBERSECURITY SOFTWARE. CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ALONE CANNOT BEAR THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF PURCHASING THE NEW SYSTEMS THEY NEED HELP. AND THEY NEED OUR HELP FROM THE STATE'S. WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO MODERNIZE OUR VOTING EQUIPMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE SECURITY OF ELECTIONS. TO EXPAND VOTING OPPORTUNITIES AND TO IMPROVE DISABILITY AND LANGUAGE ACCESS BY INCLUDING THIS ITEM IN THE BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE WILL CLEARLY ILLUSTRATE THEIR UNDERSTANDING THAT INVESTMENT IN VOTING SYSTEMS. IS INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA VOTERS. AND THE HEALTH OF OUR DEMOCRACY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND STATE INVESTMENT NEW VOTING SYSTEMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ELLIOTT. A CAROLINGIAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GIVEN THE CONDITION OF THE VOTING SYSTEMS I AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ARE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES. OFF FOR PURCHASING NEW VOTING EQUIPMENT. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER DISTRIBUTING THIS FUNDING. BASED ON THE COST COUNTIES WOULD INCUR FIVE TO IMPLEMENT THE SP FOUR FIFTY MODEL OR THE VOTE CENTER MONO WHICH WAS. A BILL PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO TO PERK UP OPEN VOTE CENTERS FOR LONGER DURATIONS OF TIME THAT THERE ARE FEWER OF THEM RELATIVE TO THE PRECINCT MODEL. WE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND REQUIRING. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF US BEFORE FIFTY DUE TO THE. NATURE OF THE VOTING SYSTEMS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT THAT DISTURBING THE FUNDING IN THIS METHOD WOULD PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO MOVE TO THIS. UP METHOD OF VOTING. FINANCE. JOHN FITZPATRICK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. JUST A SMALL NOTE THAT THE. WAY THE FUNDING IS PROJECTED TO BE DISTRIBUTED AT THIS TIME. PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE FOR EACH COUNTY TO MOVE TO THE VOTE CENTER MODEL AS THE COSTS THE LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MODEL. ARE WHAT. OUR PROJECT WHERE THE AMOUNTS PROJECTED BY ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS. THANK YOU. OF QUESTIONS THE PROPOSED LEVEL FUNDING ADEQUATE FOR ALL COUNTIES. REPLACE OUR VOTING SYSTEMS. AND WHAT IS THE BASIS THAT DETERMINATION OF I HEAR FROM THE. ACTORS TING FINANCE ON THAT. RIGHT SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FINANCING IS. AND HOW WE GOT THERE IT IS I REQUEST FOR. A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION WELL OVER A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION AND REQUIRES A FIFTY FIFTY MATCH THE WAY THAT WE THE SECRETARY OF STATE ARRIVED AT THIS NUMBER. WITH OVER THE YEARS WE'VE TAKEN A LOOK AND ANALYZE FOR EACH OF THE COUNTIES THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES CALIFORNIA WHAT WOULD IT TAKE IF THEY WERE IN A POLLING PLACE MODEL TO HAVE TO REPLACE THE. PRECINCT COUNTERS THERE'S CENTRAL COUNT ALL THE MIX ALL THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY WOULD NEED INCREASING MODEL. WE THEN TOOK AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT YOU GUYS SAW IN AB SIX SIX H. THAT FIGURE COMES UP AND I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN IT IN. ELIADES REPORTS IN IN OTHER PLACES. THIS REQUEST RIGHT HERE HAVE TAKES THE. US FIFTY COUNTIES AND ASSUMES THAT ANY COUNTY THAT'S FIFTY PERCENT OR LESS WILL STAY WITHIN A BEEN A TRADITIONAL POINT PLACE MODEL. IN THE ANY COUNTY OVER FIFTY TWO PRECINCTS WILL GO TO A VOTE CENTER MODEL SO WHAT PERSONS THE COUNTIES ARE OVER FIFTY AND. IT'S. I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT PERCENTAGE I COULD SAY I GIVE YOU JUST A REGULAR RUN OFF THE LIST OF THE ONES THAT WOULD BE UNDER FIFTY FOR YOU TO GIVE AN IDEA OUR FOLLOW UP AFTER THIS HAD. THIS MEETING JUST TO GIVE THE RUNDOWN OF IT THIS WAY SO THE ONES THAT ARE GREATER THAN FIFTY PRECINCTS WOULD BE OUR SOON TO BE IN A. A VOTE CENTER MODEL SO THERE'S. SAVINGS A REALIZE THE EQUIPMENT IS DIFFERENT THERE'S NOT AS MANY PRECINCT BASS COUNTERS IT'S MOSTLY YOUR CENTRAL COUNTY OF OTHER EQUIPMENT THAT'S INVOLVED WHICH IS. DEMAND SO THIS FIGURE THE ONE THIRTY FOUR. IS TAKES THAT. STRUCTURE AND PUTS IN PLACE AND HASA FIFTY FIFTY FIFTY MATCH BY THE COUNTIES. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IS ITS VISION. SUFFICIENT FOR WHAT THIS MODEL IDIOTS WHICH IS. LESS THAN FIFTY PRECINCTS RIGHT BASED THEY WITHIN A TRADITIONAL POINT PLACE MODEL GREATER THAN FIFTY PRECINCTS THERE IN A BOAT CENTER MODEL THAT'S WHAT GETS AT TAUGHT WHAT JOHN WAS SAYING THAT. THE INCENTIVE TO GO TO A VOTE CENTER IS THE. EFFICIENCIES THAT YOU'LL REAL THAT I COUNTY WOULD REALIZE IN GOING TO THAT AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO FUND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR COSTS VERSUS STAYING IN A TRADITIONAL POLLING PLACE. A MODEL FOR THAT HELP YES. JUST ILLEGAL COMMENTS ON THAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT RESPONSE. BUT SO WHERE WERE FAMILIAR WITH HOW THE NUMBER WAS. DETERMINED IN THIS ASSUMES AS WAS ALREADY NOTED A FIFTY FIFTY MATCH IN THE PAST. A FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE STATE ARE PASSED A BOND MEASURE TO I PURCHASE VOTING EQUIPMENT FOR COUNTIES IT WAS A THREE TO ONE MATCH WHERE THE BOND MONIES COVERED. A THREE QUARTERS OF THE VOTING SYSTEMS COSTS. AT THE OTHER I A POINT I'LL JUST AYE REINFORCES THAT ANY COUNTIES THAT OPS TO. A RETAINER MAC CONTINUE THE PRECINCT MODEL WILL INCUR COSTS ABOVE. WHAT IS ESTIMATED IN THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET ITEM? THE QUESTION THE COMMITTEE. STRUCTURE I GIVE US CHAIR ONA FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE CHAIR WAS JUST ASKING SO. ASSUMING THE FIFTY FIFTY MATCH ARE YOU THEN ASSUMING THAT THE LOCALS WILL BE ABLE TO DO THEIR PART OF THAT THE MATCH. WITHIN THERE'S YES THAT THEIR ASSUMPTION THAT THE COUNTIES WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE FIFTY FIFTY MATCH AND WOULD THEY BE BUYING THEIR EQUIPMENT TO RELEASING THEIR EQUIPMENT SO THE BUDGET PROPOSAL CONTEMPLATES THAT WOULD BE EITHER. BUYING OR PURCHASE OR LEASING. AND. I NO IN RECENT YEARS ARE BEEN A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO ELECTION LAW THAT CHANGES HOW COUNTIES ADMINISTER ELECTIONS ARE. A WITH THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WILL HE COUNTY BE ABLE TO KEEP UP. GIVEN THE LEVEL OF FUNDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK THAT THAT THE PROPOSAL ON THE ANALYSIS THAT WE DID ON THE COST CONTEMPLATE THE CHANGES THE EVIL BOOKS THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMING FORWARD THAT COUNTIES. I WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT WITH THEM THE FUNDING. CHIEF ABOLISH ABOUT THAT. I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. ARM. I ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER LEGISLATORS WE BELIEVE THAT. THAT IT MAKES SENSE FOR US AS A STATE TO LOOK AT A PUBLICLY OWNED OPEN SOURCE VOTING SYSTEM. I THINK THERE ARE MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO BELIEVE THAT SUCH A SYSTEM COULD HELP SAVE THE STATE AS WELL AS COUNTIES. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS RESOURCES AND I KNOW THERE IS A PROPOSAL FOR. ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR A MATCHING PROGRAM TO DEVELOP. AN OPEN SOURCE SYSTEM THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY COUNTY TO USE. AND THERE ELECTIONS AND WONDERING IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY INITIAL REACTIONS OUR THOUGHTS TO. THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE FLOATING AROUND ON THIS. I'LL GIVE YOU MY THOUGHTS I HAD IN MY BEHALF THE SECRETARY OF STATE I THINK. SECTOR STATE HAS BEEN A. A BIG SUPPORTER OF OPEN SOURCE VOTING A WE. HAVE BEEN WATCHING CLOSELY WITH EXCITEMENT WHAT LA IS DOING WITH THEIR VISA PROD PROJECT. HAVE HAD MANY COMMUNICATIONS WITH SAN FRANCISCO AND WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT FORWARDS IN DOING WITH THAT WITH AN OPEN SOURCE. SYSTEMS THE SECRETARY SUPPORTS OPEN SOURCE VOTING. HAS BEEN THREE SIXTY BUT IT IMPLEMENTED IN AND SPIT MAKE PROVISIONS FOR OPEN SOURCE VOTING WHICH PUTS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I THINK WAS. A. OF TIME SENATE'S. PRETTY ISN'T IT A PITY AS BILL SPONSORED SAM WE'VE ALSO BEGAN TO WORKING CLOSE WITH LA TWO INCH TO HELP THEM GET THEIR SYSTEM. TESTED WHICH JUST STARTED TESTING THAT THERE HAD CENTRAL COUNT SYSTEM AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT. WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT? PALM AND THEN. ARE YOU ASSUMING THEN THAT NOTHING THIS BUDGET THOUGH. MOVES IN THAT DIRECTION RIGHT. AT THIS MOMENT IT IS. IT IT DEAD TELL ME WOULD EXPLAIN IT BY A PHASER MONEY IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THAT WOULD MOVE FORWARD A AN OPEN SOURCE VOTING SYSTEM. THEY'RE IN THIS IT'S IT'S OPEN ENDED IT DOESN'T SAY WHAT TYPE OF SYSTEM ARE NOT IT I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT. AND THERE'S NO LIMITATION ON IT SO I WOULD ANTICIPATE FOR EXAMPLE THAT IF. LOS ANGELES COUNTY WANTED TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THAT EXPENDITURES THAT THEY'VE MADE IN. AND IT CREATING THEIR BE SAP HAD VOTING SYSTEM THAT THIS WOULD BE REIMBURSABLE THROUGH THIS FUND OKAY AND AND AND WOOD. WOULD YOUR AGENCY BE OPEN TO SOME SORT OF MATCHING PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TO COUNTIES TO HELP DEVELOP. AN OPEN SOURCE SYSTEM WILL BE OPEN TO ANY CONSIDERATION. I APPRECIATE THAT I CERTAINLY KNOW SPEAKING FOR FOR MY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE LEAST A SYSTEM SENSE. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND ARE UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE ESTIMATING THAT THE SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO BE OBSOLETE BY TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS IS CERTAINLY. HAS EMERGENCY FOR FOR MY COUNTY. BUT I ALSO KNOW I THINK THE IDEA OF AN OPEN SOURCE SYSTEM IS ONE THAT HAS. A LOT OF APPEAL FOR A LOT OF REASONS FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT FROM A SECURITY STANDPOINT FROM A. UP FROM A FROM A TRANSPARENCY STANDPOINT SO CERTAINLY SOMETHING I'M INTERESTED IN AND AND WORKING ON AND I KNOW I'VE HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH THE SECRETARY ABOUT A. A ABOUT HOUSE MS FOURTEEN BUCKS FOR I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT ABSOLUTELY DO ANY COMMENTS ON THAT. SO I SEE THAT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING I DO BUT NOT ON THAT AWAIT OKAY. ILIO OR DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE IDEA OF AN OPEN SOURCE SYSTEM. AND NOT SPECIFICALLY TO AN OPEN SOURCE SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING RELATIVELY CLOSELY WHAT. LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN DOING WHERE LESS MOTOR WITH SAN FRANCISCO BUT. TO THE EXTENT THAT COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP THESE SYSTEMS. AND GET THEM APPROVED THROUGH THE SECRETARY SEE IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE FOR THE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU. LOOK UP PUBLIC COMMENT. SORRY MISTER CHAIR FROM A VOTE BY A ROUGH COUNT HERE YOU'D ASKED HOW MANY OF THE COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE CONSIDERED SMALL COUNTIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PROPOSAL. IT'S ABOUT A QUARTER OF THOSE COUNTIES WHICH. CHARACTERIZED AS HAVING FIFTY PRECINCTS OR FEWER. AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE THE CHOICE BETWEEN VOTE CENTER OR POLLING PLACE FOR THOSE SMALLER COUNTIES. IS NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THEM THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE ASSOCIATED WITH CONSOLIDATING DOESN'T APPLY TO THE SAME DEGREE FOR THOSE SMALLER COUNTIES. AND SO I JUST WANT TO DEVELOP A GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S RIGHT NOW OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT. WELL DOCTOR CHOI. I WONDER IF YOU ARE AIMING FOR THIS I YEAR ELECTION. SEVENFOLD THIS A NEW MACHINES. I THINK IT WILL BE THAT WOULD BE OUR HOPE AND OUR GOAL IF THE IF IT'S. APPROVED THEN WE MOVE FORGET TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH THE COUNTY YOU ALREADY PRE SELECTED THE SYSTEM WHICH SYSTEMS SO IS A POPULAR OR NOT COUNTY SO. FAR IN THE STATE TO HAVE TO USE THE SAME KIND OF MACHINE NO SO WE WOULD IT UNDER THE ELECTION CODE WE LEAVE IT UP TO STILL UP TO THE COUNTIES AND WE THE SECTOR SHE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WE'VE PUT PARAMETERS ON THE MONEY. FOR EXAMPLE WE WOULD REQUIRE THAT IT BE ONLY USED FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR EQUIPMENT THAT HAS THAT MEETS THE NEW AND CVS AS THE CALIFORNIA VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS AND NOT TESTED TO THE OLD SYSTEM THE OLD STANDARDS WOULD WANT IT TO BE. THE NEW GENERATION EQUIPMENT NOT LEGACY EQUIPMENT THAT THEY'RE USING THE MONEY FOR IT WILL NOT BE. EASIER AND A CONVENIENT AND A SAFER TO. TRIED TO CHANGE. THE VOTING SYSTEM AND NOW I'M ELECTION YOU KNOW SO THAT THAT THEY CAN TEST AND THE TRAIN UP PROPERLY RATHER THAN JUST A RUSHED IN FEW MONTHS HE HAD THE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S REALLY UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COUNTIES THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY THAT WOULD BE. IDEAL LIKE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT NEW EQUIPMENT SO THEY'VE THEY'VE STARTED SOCIALIZING AND LOOKING AT THE. AT WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED AND WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY SO THERE MAY BE SOME SOME COUNTIES THAT WOULD ASSUMING WE GET CONTRACTS AND A PLACE THAT THEY. WOULD BE READY IN AND I NOVEMBER. BUT MOST IN THE TO YOU ALL LIKE I AND FORCING. MANDATING TO. A TWO IT THIS YEAR NO WE WOULD NOT SHIA. WHAT ABOUT THE EIFFEL TOWER MUSIC CANNOT COME UP WITH THE? IDEA TO HALF. I. HE YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A IF THE BILL PASSES AND IT'S A FIFTY FIFTY MATCH WOULD BUT WORK CLOSELY WITH COUNTIES TO SEE IF THERE WAS SOME OF THE SOME WAY THAT WE COULD ASSIST THEM ARE GEORGE PRIDE. OTHER RESOURCES AND WORK CLOSELY WITH THEIR BOARDS TO SEE IF THERE WAS THERE ANY OTHER OPTIONS AWAY TO FIND FUNDING SO IT WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM. WHEN THE COUNTIES UNKNOWNS IS COMING FOR A LONG TIME TO SELL. I THINK THAT HOPE THAT'S COMING FOR A LONG TIME. THE GUILTY PUBLIC COMMON ELEMENTS. AT YOUR CHAIR OF UNTIL LEVINE I AM REPPERT I'M FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY SEE YEAH COUNTY. AND SO. OKAY IT'S BROKEN AND I AM REPRESENTING THE COUNTY CLERK'S ASSOCIATION DAY COUNTY CLERKS. ELECTION OFFICIAL AND SAY THE WHOLE WORK IT'S. AND THIS MONEY IS LIKE PLEASE ARE VOTING SYSTEMS ARE OLD THEY ARE DECREPIT THEY ARE CAUSING US PROBLEMS AND. YOU KNOW THE STANDARDS ARE HIGH WE WANT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT US WITH OUR VOTING SYSTEMS AND MONEY MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED PERCENT. WE FIGHT WITH OUR IN OUR COUNTY THEM COUNTIES USE GENERAL FUND MONEY TO GET A VOTING SYSTEM. AND THIS IS NOT A SMALL PURCHASE AND WHEN WE HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST OUR SHERIFFS AND ARE. YOU KNOW. EVERYBODY ELSE IT'S SO IT'S DIFFICULT. MS EXAMPLE FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE'VE HAD OUR SYSTEM WE HAD OUR SYSTEM SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. WHEN WE TRIED TO TEST IT WHEN WE TESTED IT TOO FOR. LOGIC INACCURACY FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THERE WAS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE HAD AND IT TOOK US QUITE AWHILE TO FIND ENOUGH EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD PASS THE TESTING SO WE COULD PUT IT OUT THERE FOR TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. OUR CENTRAL COUNT MACHINE WAS SO OLD THAT IT KIND OF SHAPE SIDE OF A BALLOT OFF. AND THE VENDOR SAID THE BEST THING WE COULD DO IS PUT TAPE ON IT. SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE WE ARE IN ONE IT SUSAN COMMENTED THAT WE WERE LOOKING ON EBAY FOR PARTS AND USING TAPE TO HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER. WE WANT THAT ACCURACY WE WANT THESE NEW SYSTEMS SO THEY WILL WORK AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY'S ONLY ONE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT THAT. WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR NEW SYSTEMS. SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR VOTE ON THIS THANK YOU CLEAR STILL THAT'S MONTHLY OF AMAZING STAFF DOWN THERE. YEAH STARBASE THANK YOU.

PRETTY WELL THE RHETORIC REFLECT EGGMAN VENOMOUS COMEY EURO. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS MELINDA DUBROW FROM THE REGISTRAR FROM SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. I'M HERE IT TO VOICE SUPPORT IN OF THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. JUST IT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OUR OUR SYSTEMS ARE. SECURE IN ACCURATE. BUT THE MACHINES ARE FALLING APART. WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ALMOST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS THAT COME IN AND THEY NEED TO BE HAND FED ONE BY ONE INTO OUR SCANNING SYSTEM. THE THE ROLLERS THAT FEED THE PAPERS INTO THE SCANNERS ARE SOLD WE CAN'T FIND. REPLACEMENTS WE'VE HAD TO SEARCH AROUND FOR THEM. THE ROLLERS THAT WE HAVE OUR GOOEY. OF THE RUBBER IS DOING AND. WE WANT VERY MUCH TO REPLACE THE SYSTEMS I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT WE WANT OF THE COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO USE THE FUNDS BASED ON OUR OWN DETERMINATION OF OUR NEEDS. SO THAT WHETHER WE ARE A. VOTE CENTER COUNTY. RIGHT OFF THE BAT OR WE WAIT. AND. IMPLEMENT VOTE CENTERS ON THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT LATER WE WANT TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO SPEND THE FUNDS WHETHER IT'S A LEASE. OF OR TWO BUT.

VINCENT OF CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T BUILD SKILLED NURSING FACILITY GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS COBY PETERSON DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR THE VETERANS ON SOME OF. CALIFORNIA I'VE. NUMBER OF FOLKS WITH ME TODAY THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME ST GERARD ASSISTANT DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S FAIRS. GOOD AFTERNOON THOMAS MARMOSET STEP A SECRETARY FOR VETERANS. SO COME HALF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. REPRESENTS A PROPOSAL FOR A BRAND NEW TWO HUNDRED FORTY. BED SNIFF BUILDING AT THE ON BILL VETERANS HOME. OF THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL AYE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. REFLECTS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR PRELIMINARY PLANS. AND THE CUSTOMARY DESIGN BID BILL DELIVERY SYSTEM. SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE DONE AN EVALUATION OF THE PROPERTY. SOME ENVIRONMENTAL. STUDIES. SOME VALUE. ANALYSIS AND HAVE COME BACK WITH A PROPOSAL THAT REFLECTS A NEW. DELIVERY SYSTEM DESIGNED BUILT. THAT THE DESIGN BUILD. PROPOSAL REFLECTS THE REQUEST OF SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. THE DESIGN BUILD A PROPOSAL REFLECTS. WHAT WE THINK? IS. ADDED VALUE FOR THE STATE. AND OVERALL IT IS A REDUCTION IN TWENTY THREE POINT. IT'S MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEY. REDUCTION IN SCHEDULE OF SIX TO POTENTIALLY TWELVE MONTHS TIME. LL. JACKIE REST OF AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA. WE DO RAISE SOME INITIAL CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL BUT LARGELY JUST TAKING A STEP BACK. THE THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE PROPOSAL AS WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE CURRENT FACILITIES AND YAWNED BILL. IN. DUE TO THEIR AGE OR THEIR DESIGN THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE RESIDENTS WITH. HIGH LEVELS OF CARE AND THEN ALSO JUST THE COORDINATION OF THEIR EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES IS WHILE. AND DO WE AGREE THAT THIS DOES PRESENT AN ISSUE I THINK ARC MAIN CONCERNS REVOLVE AROUND THE PROCESS IN WHICH THIS IS HAPPENING. CURRENTLY. THERE IS THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING ON A LEGISLATIVELY REQUESTED MASTER PLAN THAT MAINLY IS HOPING TO LOOK AT NOT ONLY WHAT CURRENT NEEDS ARE BUT THEN ALSO FUTURE DEMANDS WITHIN THE VETERANS HOMES. SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN USE THAT AS A TOOL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO PRIORITIZE FUTURE CHANGES WITHIN THE ENTIRE VETERAN HOME SYSTEM MEAN ACROSS ALL EIGHT OF THE VETERANS HOMES. ON AND THEN WATER THE ASSOCIATED TRADE OFFS OF ANY CHANGES MADE TO THE VETERAN HOME SYSTEM AS YOUR PRIORITIZING THOSE PROJECTS. BE IT NEAR TERM OR THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THAT. WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IN GENERAL. IT A LACK OF A MASTER PLAN REALLY. RAISES SOME INITIAL QUESTIONS THAT JUST AREN'T ANSWERED QUITE YET. AS OUTLINED IN YOUR GENDER THOSE QUESTIONS REALLY REVOLVED AROUND ONE. HOUSE THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTING THAT THE PROPOSED CAPACITY OF THESE NEW FACILITIES WHICH MAINLY WOULD JUST REPLACE. THE CURRENT FACILITY OF SPENT YOUNG FELLA WOULDN'T NECESSARILY EXPAND CAPACITY ON IS THE BEST SIZE TO NOT ONLY MEET CURRENT DEMAND BUT ALSO FUTURE DEMAND. ALSO ARE THERE OTHER PLANS I'M IN ADDITION TO THIS ONE TO EXPAND CAPACITY WITHIN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND WITHIN THE SKILLED NURSING OR MEMORY CARE SERVICES WHICH CURRENTLY. IS ON ONE OF THE HIGHER UNMET NEEDS WITHIN THE CALM CALVET SYSTEM AND ANOTHER QUESTION TO JUST LOOKING FORWARD THERE SEEMS TO BE TO AT TIMES COMPETING. PRIORITIES AT PLAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CALVET SYSTEM ONE IS YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN CAPACITY IN ORDER TO MEET CURRENT NEEDS. BUT ANOTHER AND YOU ALSO WANT TO EXPAND CAPACITY IN LIGHT OF ANY FUTURE DEMAND OR UNMET NEED THAT WE CURRENTLY SEE IN IT SEEMS LIKE THIS PROPOSAL IS ON THE SIDE OF MAINTAINING CAPACITY. BUT LACK OF MASTER PLAN IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR WHAT ARE THE ASSOCIATED TRADE OFFS OF MAINTAINING CAPACITY AS OPPOSED TO EXPANDING CAPACITY IN THE NEAR TERM. AND IS THERE A LONG TERM THAN PLANNED TO GET UP THAT EXPANDED CAPACITY ISSUE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DELAY THE CHECK THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE ACCOUNT THAT VETERAN HOMES. FOR THE END WITHIN THE VETERAN HOME SYSTEM. PENDING THE COMPLETION OF THE MASTER PLAN WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED JULY TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE ALSO RAISE OTHER QUESTIONS. THAT OTHER ISSUES AROUND TO THIS POTENTIALLY IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE INTO CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THE MASTER PLAN AND PERHAPS. PROVIDE FURTHER GUIDANCE OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE MASTER PLAN IN. YOUR ATTENDED DOES LAY OUT IN THE STAFF COMMENT SECTION ONE LOOKING AT THE MODEL OF CARE WITHIN THE CALVET AND SYSTEM IF ENOUGH THAT SOMETHING OF INTEREST THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE. IN THIS LONG TERM MASTER PLAN CONCEPT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. YOU COULD ADD AS AN OBJECTIVE IN THE MASTER PLAN AND SCOPE PROPERLY BUT AGAIN WE ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF ANY ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES ARE THINGS THAT ARE TACKED ON TO THE MASTER PLAN TO ALSO LOOK AT THE RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. WELL I THINK YOU'RE VERY THOROUGH IN YOUR COMMENTS IN THOSE ACTUALLY DOVETAIL INTO MY QUESTIONS ON. THE MASTER PLAN IS FIFTEEN MONTHS WAY. IT WAS LIVE NEXT YEAR SO. CAN YOU ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS CERTAINLY SO ON. THE THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS FROM A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MASTER PLAN THAT WE DID SPECIFICALLY. SPECIFICALLY AT THE APPLE VETERANS HOME. THE NUMBERS. THAT ARE IN THE PROPOSAL REFLECT THE CURRENT. SNIFF. BED COUNT A LITTLE BIT OF THE WAITING LIST. AND IT ALSO REFLECTS THE ADEQUATE SIZE THAT THE PROPERTY CAN CAN HANDLE. THE IF YOU ASK IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR WHAT WOULD AN ADEQUATE SIZE OF A SNIFF BUILDING IS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY BEDS IS GETTING TOWARDS THE MAXIMUM WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH OUR WITH OUR CURRENT NEW HOMES. AND WE'RE FINDING THAT. TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED IS IS ABOUT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT SO OUR OUR. THAT THE NUMBER THAT WE'RE PROPOSING REFLECTS. SOME INTERNAL ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE DONE IT REFLECTS THE ANALYSIS DONE A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND IT DOES REPLACE THE EXISTING SNIFFED BUILDING. THE EXISTING STAFF BUILDING IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY POOR. CONDITION AT ANY GIVEN TIME ANY OF OUR CONTROL AGENCIES PUBLIC HEALTH CMS YOU STV A CAN GOING INSIDE THE US FOR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS YET THEY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION THEY DON'T GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THIS IS UNFIT. FOR LIVING BUT THEY DO CALL US OUT SO AT ANY GIVEN TIME WERE THROWING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS AT ANY. DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF REPAIRS AND SO FORTH. WE FEEL THAT REGARDLESS OF THE ANALYSIS THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE. THE THE END RESULT WILL BE A NEED FOR A NEW STAFF BUILDING AT THE OUTFIELD VETERANS HOME. ON THAT IF YOU WERE TO DELAY THIS THE THE FACT THAT WE ARE HERE TODAY IS. EVER SINCE I BEGAN IT CAL THAT WHICH IS IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FORWARD WITH A REQUEST FOR A NEW SNIFFED BUILDING. THERE IS MOMENTUM AT STAKE. GETTING STAKEHOLDERS TO. TO BUY OFF ON THE IDEA GETTING THE U. S. DEVIATE TOO ACCEPTED GRANT AND ACCEPT THAT GRANT LAST WEEK WE JUST UPDATED OUR PRE APPLICATION WITH U. S. DBA. TO STAY WITHIN THEIR BUDGET CYCLE SO IT'S NOT JUST. ALLOWING FOR THIS EXERCISE TO OCCUR AND PUTTING THAT THEN BACK IN PLACE AFTER FIFTEEN MONTHS WE'RE GOING TO DELAY IT MUCH LONGER THAN THAT BECAUSE OF THE THE MOMENTUM PROCESS THAT HAS TO OCCUR. SO SELECT CREEK THE ARGUMENT IS THE SIZE THE FACILITY WILL NOT CHANGE RUN THAT TO LEARN WITH A TUNER FORTY BED MAXIMUM. THAT DOES SO THAT'S THE PROPOSAL THAT WERE WERE MAKING WE FEEL BASED ON SOME OF THE EVALUATIONS THAT WE'VE DONE ENVIRONMENTALLY AND AND SO FORTH THAT THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER THEY'LL HAVE TO BE AN ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION DONE ON THE ENTIRE PROPERTY TO. TO ADDRESS THIS SO EVEN THAT WILL WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE SIGNS. ON THE STATE HA HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICE WILL WILL COMMENT ON THE APPROPRIATESIZE IT HAS TO MATCH THE EXISTING STRUCTURE BECAUSE THE FACILITIES SO ALL. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN PLAY OTHER JUST AN ANALYSIS THAT COMES BACK AND SAYS. THIS IS WHAT'S NECESSARY AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME ARE SYSTEM WIDE. OTHER LARGER SNIFF AUTHORITIES IN THE COUNTRY. OR DOES IT SO SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. MISTER CHAIRMAN THE NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL THE SENATE FACILITIES CROSS COUNTRY TO HONOR BETTER LESS BUT THERE'S A FIVE PERCENT THAT ARE A LITTLE SO. WE ARE THE LARGEST WE ARE NOW THAT THE LARGEST I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK IN IN COMPARISON AND SCOPE OF SIZE. IS IT IS A REALLY APPLES APPLES COMPARISON THERE WAS AB ITS OR IT IF IT'S NOT A SELL OT IS THE WHAT WE WANNA DO IS WHEN ADDRESSED THAT THE NEED THE AUDIENCE THE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE NEXT FIVE TEN TWENTY YEARS WE WANT TO BUILD. A FACILITY THAT'S TOO LARGE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE AUDIENCE ON THE OTHER HAND. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH ANY OF. ANY NEW CONSTRUCTION OR ANY SITE LOCATION IS IS GOING TO BE THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY SO IF YOU PUT A FIVE HUNDRED BED FACILITY IN THE NAPA COUNTY BURDEN THE ALPHA HOME THAT'S. THAT'S GONNA OVERWHELM DID THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE ABILITY TO% TAKE CARE OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY WHEN DAVE SAID THAT THEY'VE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT AND AND ENERGY INTO. WHAT WHAT WILL WHAT WILL WORK THERE? IT SO HAPPENS TO BE FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE NOW. THE THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD ADD IS THAT THE. THE REQUEST FOR PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. SATISFIES A STANDARD. SO THAT THE STANDARD BY WHICH THE THE FACILITY WILL BE BUILT. THE NUMBER IS IRRELEVANT. THE NUMBER CAN ALWAYS BE ADJUSTED SO WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT PERFORMANCE CRITERIA BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE IN PARALLEL WITH THE MASTER PLAN. CERTAINLY RETARDED REP OF THE NUMBER CAN BE ADJUSTED SO THERE'S. THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE TO TO BUILD OUTER. REFER ADDITIONS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHAT MS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IS THAT THE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND THE NUMBER OF OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY BED. PROPOSAL COULD BE ADJUSTED TO BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN NEED AT THE END OF THAT FIFTEEN MONTH PERIOD. ALL I'M SUGGESTING IS THAT WE SEE THAT AS POTENTIALLY A COMPROMISE THAT ALLOWS BOTH TO CONTINUE IN PARALLEL WE RESPECT THE FACT THAT THE THE. COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE A MASTER PLAN DONE ON A SYSTEM WIDE BASIS WE DON'T. HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT WE SEE THAT BOTH PROPOSALS CAN GO FORWARD IN PARALLEL NOT LINEAR BECAUSE IF THEY'RE PUT IN TO A LINEAR FASHION. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IS A MUCH LONGER DELAY THAN SIMPLY JUST FIFTEEN MONTHS FOR AN ANALYSIS TO BE DONE? OKAY A FINANCE. YES DAHLE LOOKING BUILT PARTNER FINANCE SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL FOR SOMETIME NOW. AND WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT SUPPORT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT AT THIS TIME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IT'S THE TO THE DEPARTMENT ALREADY STATED. HALDERMAN HOSPITAL HAS UP SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL AND FUNCTIONAL FOUND DEFICIENCIES NOT TO MENTION A FIRE LIKE SAFETY DEFICIENCIES. AND WHAT WE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE MASTER PLAN MIGHT DELIVER. SOME FINDINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION A ONE ACT ON IT SOME SOME LATER DATE. WE FEEL THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IT CONSIDERS THE CONDITION OF THE HALDERMAN FACILITY IT IT IS GOING TO COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION WHICH IS THAT THAT. FACILITY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED THE SAME CONCLUSION AS THE BUTTON. NAM DON'T GO MASTER PLAN FOR TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT. SO THIS THIS. STUDY WON'T BE DONE UNTIL JULY SO THE NEXT IF IF THIS IS DONE IN A LINEAR FASHION HAS OF MR DRIVE WAS SAYING. THEN WE COULDN'T CONSIDER THIS AGAIN UNTIL THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET SO THAT PUTS IT OUT TWO YEARS IN THAT ALSO. SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE PROJECT COST ARMING ESCALATION ALONE IT WOULD BE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY. AND ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER FACTORS MIGHT BE AFFECTING AT THAT TIME SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S AGREEMENT THAT THE. YOU KNOW THE FACILITY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED IN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROJECT MOVE FORWARD WITH IT SPEED BE PRUDENT TO DO SO NOW. OKAY THANK YOU. THE COMEDIAN AND STAFFERS SAID HERE ABOUT THE LOSS OF YOUR EMPLOYEES EARLIER THIS YEAR. AT THE ALPHA VETERANS HOME. UNDERSTAND CHP IN TWO THOUSAND TEN PROVIDING ASSESSMENT OF THE SECURITY ON CAMPUS. HE DISCUSS WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED NOT ASSESSMENT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. SO I'M WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO TO RESPOND TO TWO QUESTIONS OF SECURITY. BASED ON THE ON GOING INVESTIGATION AT THIS TIME SO MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT. AT A FURTHER DATE WE CAN PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION SURE AND IT WITH THIS COMMITTEE DOES HAVE AN INTEREST IN HEARING WHAT. WAS DONE NO SLOW AFTER THAT THE TWO THOUSAND CENSUS MINUTES EIGHT YEARS LATER SO THERE'S A STRONG INTEREST. FOR HIM TO SEE WHAT IS DONE AND YOU KNOW WHETHER ACTIONS BEING TAKEN TO. TO BE PARTICULARLY THEIR SO AT SOME POINT. WITH UNDERSERVED BACK AND DID IT DO PRESENTATION OF THE COMMITTEE. INTEREST SO MANY QUESTIONS IN COMMITTEE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. COUPLES PUBLIC COMMENT. ENSURE THE STATE'S VETERANS HOMES HAVE POLISH AUTHORITIES TO MEET THEIR NEEDS IS AGES CRITICAL FOR LONGTIME THE FACILITIES THAT HELP FILL A BIT OUT OF DATE. ACOSTA TO MAINTAIN THIS PROPOSAL ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT THAT HOWEVER. PROPOSAL IS COMING OUT IN ADVANCE OF THE SYSTEM WIDE MASTER PLAN THAT LEGISLATURE DIRECTED CALVET TO DEVELOP TO ADDRESS THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THE VETERANS. OUR COUNTRY IS MOVING DIRECTION PROVIDING COMMUNITY BASED CARE AND SO THE PROVIDING CARE INSTITUTIONS THEREFORE IT WAS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THE MASTER PLAN MIGHT TAKE THE NEED. TO PLACE NOW BILL IS OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY BASED CARE APPROACH. A COMMUNITY BASED APPROACH WILL LIKELY DEVELOP A GREATER NUMBER OF SMALLER SINGLE STORY FACILITIES THAT ALLOW VETERANS TO REMAIN PHYSICALLY CLOSER TO FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO PROVE THIS PROPOSAL IT WOULD MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO THE INSTITUTIONAL CARE AND DO NOTHING TO HELP THE VETERANS AGE. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WE'RE HOLDING OPEN THE SIDE OF TO RALPH TYPE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. TO CONSIDER IF ADDITIONAL STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN TO BETTER ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR VETERANS NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. THREE WHOLE THIS ITEM OPEN HOPE FOR YOU A. TAKE OUR COMMENTS TO CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHEN OUR NEXT AUTUMN. ISSUE NUMBER TWO. AND REPORTING LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE ON THE VETERANS ON TO CALIFORNIA. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY FIVE. MOMENT. HIGH ON GOOD AFTERNOON MY MY NAME IS BEST MISSION SCHEME AND CHIEF OF RESEARCH AND PROGRAM REVIEW FOR THE VETERANS HOMES DIVISION. ON MY WON'T. GOING TO TO TOO MUCH DETAIL BECAUSE YOU HAVE IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND I THINK IT'S SOME IT'S PRETTY. CLEAR AND CONCISE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND WE ARM. WE ARE. REQUESTING THE FUNDING FOR. POSITION ONE. OTHER THAN CAPITAL ASSETS UNIT RELATED TO. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TRACKING IT CETERA AND. ONE WITHIN ARE COUNTING OF THE UNIT. TO ADDRESS THE COST CALCULATIONS THAT COMPONENT OF IT I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS UNLESS YOU LIKE TO HEAR ADDITIONAL EVER FEEL. THAT YOU FAILURE. FINANCE. THE QUESTION THE COMMITTEE. ANYONE WISHES NICHOLAS ON PUBLIC. OKAY THERE NO CONCERNS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON THIS ITEM STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROVE THE PROPOSAL AND UP TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ADD TO THE ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. YOU COME IN THE CALVET PROVIDE INFORMATION ON ALL THE LEASES AND OTHER THIRD PARTY USES OF STATE PROPERTY AND CAL THAT'S A VETERANS HOMES. I SHOULD LEASES THE STATE INTEREST ENTERS INTO APPROPRIATE. WILL HELP FORM RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE WHOLE THIS ITEM OPEN. EVEN IF YOU. PUT IT ON YOUR NEXT ITEMS GIVES ME PART. PARDEE CHAIR SORRY YOUR CHILD PARTNER FINANCE WE JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT. THE PER OF THE TRAILER BILL IS NOT A PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND. Y. WE HAVEN'T GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NATALIE DANIEL I'M DEAD DEBBIE DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STAFF HERE THAT CAN HELP ASSIST WITH ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. DCA HAS TO PROPOSALS IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SP ONE SEVENTY THREE. THE FIRST IS A FALL BCP WHICH IS ACTUALLY REDIRECTS ELEVEN POSITIONS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS. FROM THE DCA TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE WHICH WOULD EFFECTIVE JULY ONE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO ADD SEVEN ADDITIONAL STAFF TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE AND ALLOWS FOR THEM TO CONTRACT WITH DC A. FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES BY MEANS OF AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT. AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR UP TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS A SPRING FINANCE LETTER THAT PROPOSES ADDITIONAL. AND INCREMENTAL REACH YOUR. I'M SORRY REDUCTIONS TO DCA CENTRAL AYE STAFF FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AN ON GOING. THE FINANCE WATER REDUCTIONS ARE PROPOSED IN ADDITION TO THE FALL BCP AND SHE WANTED TO LEAVE THE FINANCE WATER WILL REDUCE DCA CENTRALIZED SERVICES BY FIFTEEN POSITIONS. AND. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BALL B. CP THAT WOULD TOTAL TWENTY SIX POSITIONS AND APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. EARLIER. PULLING CURSING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TEST WE HAVE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THESE TWO PROPOSALS. UP FIRST WITH REGARD TO THE JANUARY PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THAT WILL THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO BEGIN CAPTURING DATA ON PAST CLIENT USAGE AND WORKLOAD. PARTICULARLY FOR ITS MAIN SERVICE SEGMENTS OF THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE OF LEGAL SERVICES IN HR SERVICES. REFER THEM. I RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT'S REPORT THIS INFORMATION. I'M SO THE MAIN RATIONALE BEHIND THIS RECOMMENDATION. I IS THAT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE WITH LIKELY OVERPAYING FOR DCA SERVICES. A MINUTE THEN CLEAR TO US HOW WIDESPREAD THE ISSUE IS WHETHER IT WAS. MOSTLY AT REAL ESTATE OR WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT AFFECTED MORE BOARDS AND BUREAUS. I'M SO IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE ISSUE ON THE ISSUE OF CROSS SUBSIDIZATION AND CONCERNS ABOUT PERRETTA HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN QUITE LONG STANDING OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS DURING THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS THAT. OF THE LEGISLATURE CONDUCTS EVERY YEAR ON THEIR OF BEEN CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THIS ISSUE I'M SO IT'S NOT A NEW ISSUE. CERTAINLY. I'M A PRETTY THIS REALLY ARISES BECAUSE THEY THE DEPARTMENT I'M ASSESSES ITS CHARGES ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. BUT RIGHT DEFERRED PURCHASE INCLUDING POSITION BASED. APPROACHES IT'S NOT CLEAR IF A POSITION ALLOCATION THAT THOSE ARE THE POSITIONS AT THE BOARDS AND HEROES IF THAT'S REALLY REFLECTIVE OF THE WORKLOAD THAT THEY REQUIRE FROM THE DEPARTMENT. SECTION NOTABLY ARE THE LEVEL OF PRO RATA THAT WAS BEING A FAST ON THE BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE WAS ONE OF THE MAIN RATIONALES BEHIND THIS LEGISLATION TO MOVE THEM OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND. IN FACT THAT RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF PER RATHER THAT THEY WERE PAYING. IS REFLECTED AS HE SAID IN THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU SEE. SPECIFICALLY IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OTHER BUREAU WAS PAYING ABOUT FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PRO RATA HOWEVER I HAD THEM THAT PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER REDUCTION IN THEIR BUDGET EVEN ACCOUNTING FOR APRIL LETTER. WE WOULD NOTICIAS PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE RAISED INCLUDING I THINK I AM A VERY RECENTLY UPDATED. DOCUMENT. BUT WE STILL THINK. THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WIDESPREAD THIS CROSS SUBSIDIZATION IS WHETHER IT'S JUST RELATED TO TO THE BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE OR WHETHER THIS IS REALLY I'M I'M MORE WIDESPREAD ISSUE. UP AND SAID WE THINK SOME OF THOSE. STILL DEFINITELY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED OUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE OTHER REPORTS WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO BETTER ASSESS THIS LEVEL OF CROSS OF CITIES SUBSIDIZATION AND DETERMINE WHETHER. ANY OTHER METHODOLOGIES USED FOR ALLOCATING COSTS. AND THE SECOND WITH REGARD TO THE APRIL FIRST LETTER. WE RECOMMEND THAT DCA THAT BE AT LEGISLATURE PREVIEW CA'S REQUESTED REDUCTIONS FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BUT NOT APPROVE THAT REQUESTED IT REDUCTIONS FOR THE OUT YEARS AT THIS POINT. INSTEAD HOW THE DEPARTMENT COME BACK IN REQUEST THOSE AT A FUTURE DATE. THIS IS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT INDICATE THAT IT BELIEVES THAT IT CAN MAKE THESE REDUCTIONS WITHOUT AFFECTING THE SERVICE LEVELS PROVIDED TO THE OTHER BOARDS AND BUREAUS. HOWEVER IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US THAT THIS IS CASE AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT HAS YET TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC POSITIONS THAT WILL BE REDUCED. AND THEREFORE DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF. SPECIFIC WAYS THAT IT'S GOING TO CHANGE ITS OPERATIONS WHETHER IT'S GONNA HOW IT CAN ABSORB THE WORKLOAD THOSE FOLKS WERE DOING OR REDISTRIBUTED ARE REALLY WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE GOING TO BE. I'M SO WE THINK BY TAKING THIS APPROACH IN JUST APPROVING THE FIRST YEAR IT WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO REVISIT THOSE. THAT'S THESE REDUCTIONS IN A FEW KEY IT NEXT YEAR BASICALLY HOW THE DEPARTMENT COME BACK THEY CAN REPORT ON THE EFFECTS OF THESE REDUCTIONS ON WHICH POSITIONS THE ELIMINATED WITH THE EFFECTS WORK AS WELL AS WHICH POSITIONS THEY'RE PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE IN FUTURE YEARS. I MEAN WE ALSO THINK THAT THE WORKLOAD INFORMATION THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THEY COLLECT COULD BE VERY VALUABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FOR INFORMING. LEGISLATIVE DECISION MAKING ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE STAFFING LEVELS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU FINANCE. LIZZY PARENTS APARTMENT FINANCE. JUST WANT TO. PROVIDE A COUPLE OF NOTES. IN RESPONSE TO THE ELLIOTTS CONCERNS WE DO UNDERSTAND THE LONGSTANDING CONCERNS REGARDING DC'S PRO RATA METHODOLOGY. HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION DOES SUPPORT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE IT'S AN EQUITABLE WAY TO DISTRIBUTE ACOSTA BOARDS AND BUREAUS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. WE FEEL THAT THIS PROVIDES OVERSIGHT AND ACCESS TO ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WITHOUT pWITHOUT. INCREASING COSTS TO DEPARTMENTS. I DO WANT TO NOTE A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT. DC IS CENTRALIZED SERVICES. MOST OF THEM ARE TRACKED. AND ACCOUNTED FOR. ON AN BONTA USE BASIS THE REMAINING SERVICES ARE CHARGED. AS PRO RATA BASED ON THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS BECAUSE THOSE. POLICY SERVICES CAN'T ALWAYS BE ATTRIBUTED TOOK FROM ONE BORDER BUREAU. HOWEVER. WE NOTE THAT DCA DOES PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND MEETS WITH ALL OF THE BOARDS BUREAUS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TALKS ABOUT THOSE PRO RATA CHARGES AND WHAT THOSE SERVICES WILL INCLUDE I'M ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS. ALSO A JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS AND CONCERNS THAT DEPARTMENT FINANCE HIGHS ABOUT TRACKING THE. USAGE IS. BUDGET PLANNING WOULD BE REALLY UNPREDICTABLE IF WE MOVED TO THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM OF ALL BASED ON. TRACKING IN USAGE. PRO RATA CHARGES COULD SPIKE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR AND ON A AN OPERATIONAL BASIS THAT PROVIDES A LOT OF. UNCERTAINTY FOR BOARDS AND HEROES AND PRETTY CA I WAS. ONE BUDGET COULD GO UP BECAUSE THEY'RE NEAT IN NEED OF MORE SERVICES AND. DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO COVER THOSE SERVICES IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE DIET A DCA DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A SYSTEM TO SUPPORT IT. THE TRACKING OF THEIR WORKLOAD AT THIS POINT TIME AND SO IT WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POSSIBLY. BESOS PROGRAM THAT WOULD ASSIST EMPLOYEES AND TRACKING THIS TYPE OF WORK. IT'S VERY UNIQUE AND NOT IT'S NOT JUST TRANSACTIONAL SERVICES THAT DC PROVIDES BUT ALSO POLICY SUPPORT SO SEPARATE FROM OTHER. STATE AGENCIES THAT DO YOU HAVE A PRO RATA STRUCTURE. THERE YOU KNOW ANALYZING POLICY ANALYZING BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AS OPPOSED TO JUST TRANSACTIONAL SUCH AS HUMAN RESOURCES AND BUDGETING TRANSACTIONAL SERVICES. THE LAST POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT TRACKING THE DATA FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT IT MAY POSSIBLY PRODUCE SKEWED DATA. AS YOU KNOW POLICY CHANGES THAT PRIORITIES CHANGE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND SO WHERE THERE MAY BE. A LOT OF POLICY EMPHASIS IN ONE SPECIFIC BORDER BUREAU IN ONE YEAR IT MIGHT IT MAY BE QUIET THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND SO IT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO. SUBSTANTIATE THIS DATA AND PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT'S VIABLE FOR US TO EVALUATE TO PRODUCE THE. THE ANSWERS THAT. THE LA EL AND AND. WOULD BE LOOKING FOR THE GOING BACK TO STATEMENT YOU THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT IS. WE DO THINK THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IS EQUITABLE AND PROVIDES A GUARANTEE OF THE SERVICE IS BEING DISTRIBUTED RIGHT WING REPORTED IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT HORRIBLE AND. PESSIMISM MEASURE YET THINGS CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUT SOME METHODOLOGY TO MEASURE WHAT. SOME IS BEING CHARGED. AND IN THE BEST ZIP LIKE GIVE A REFER SOME WERE YOU KNOW THE COUNTY. S. CHARGING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD A POLICE CAR. AND YET SOMEONE ELSE COULD DELIVER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE AS THEY GO BUT. NOT BE OVER CHARGED ON THAT'S I MEAN THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AND IT SHOULD BE A BETTER MECHANISM TO TRACK. THESE COST AND WE DO UNDERSTAND. THAT CONCERN TOTALLY. WE YOU KNOW HOW I NOTED THAT. THE MOST OF THOSE SERVICES ARE TRAPPED BY USAGE BUT THE REMAINING THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DO SUCH I'M TRACKING. ARE DONE WITH THE BEST METHODOLOGY THAT WE FEEL IS APPLICABLE TO ACROSS THE BOARD. WHOSE INTEGRAL STATE OBVIOUSLY GOT MOVED FOR A REASON AND IT REALLY STANDS OUT. SO. WHO A GOOD QUESTION ONCE APPEARED THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE? ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. FOR SELF AT A LOWER PRICE THAN THE CA TO PROVIDE SIMILAR SERVICES. I A PROVIDED A HANDOUT THAT. WAS PASSED OUT JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO THAT WALKS THROUGH THE BREAKOUT OF. THE ESTIMATED FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF WHAT BREED WOULD BE PAYING FOR THEIR PRO RATA NEXT YEAR SHOULD THEY HAVE STAINED. AND I CAN WALK THROUGH EACH OF THOSE ROSE IF YOU LIKE BUT. I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS. AND WHAT MAKES IT'S DIFFICULT IS THAT PRES CURRENT REQUEST FOR ON GOING STAFFING DOESN'T PERFECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE CA SERVICES ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS BECAUSE A LOT OF SERVICES ARE STAND ALONE SERVICES THAT REQUIRE. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE THIRTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE OR FORTY FOUR TWO BUREAUS. ADDITIONALLY THEORY HAS SOME ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN HOUSE. BEFORE JOINING THE CA PRE CONTRACTED FOR SOME SERVICES THAT THEY PRESUMABLY WILL CONTRACT FOR AGAIN ONCE THE EXIT AND THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR. ALSO. TO SAYS WITH ANY DEPARTMENT THAT STARTING OUT OR AT ANY POINT DURING THE BUDGET YEAR IF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. PRE HAS THE ABILITY TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THROUGH THE BCP PROCESS. SO. THEY MAY FIND THAT AS THEY GO ALONG THEY ARE NOT CORRECTLY RESOURCE. REMAINING DCA STAFF WILL BE REDIRECTED TO ASSIST OTHER PORTS AND BUREAUS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF NON JURISDICTIONAL WORKLOAD FUNCTIONS LIKE WHAT I WAS ALLUDING TO A MOMENT AGO THAT HAVE TO BE. SERVICED AND PAID FOR AT DCA. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE OUR PHONE BANKS OR OUR. EXECUTIVE TEAM WHO PRESUMABLY WORK ON POLICY REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY PORTS ARE BUREAUS ARE UNDERNEATH THEM. I AM. ADDITIONALLY DCA MAINTAINS A BASIC LEVEL OF CENTRO I SERVICES TO ACCOMMODATE WORKLOAD SPIKES THAT ARE NOT IT ANTICIPATED OR BUDGET IT. SO AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE THAT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS D. C. A. S. CLOWN CENTRO I STAFF TO KEEP THE BOARD. OF VOCATIONAL NURSES IN PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS AFLOAT. AND ALSO WE HAVE PROVIDED. ADDITIONAL DCA CENTRALIZED SERVICES TO ON FORWARD. HOUSEHOLD GOOD MOVERS TO BEAR HEFTY  <u><c.green>TAUGHT BUBBLES</c></u> WORKLOAD SPIKE SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT SPIKE IS NOT THERE. OBVIOUSLY YOU STILL. CARING THOSE FOLKS SO RIGHT SO ARE OUR CURRENT METHODOLOGY IN THE WAY PRO RATA WORKS IS IT'S BUILT ON AVERAGES SO IT ASSUMES THAT. EVERY POSITION MATS AND A BORDER BUREAU REQUIRES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT ON AVERAGE. SO LIKE WHEN YOU GET IN A POSITION THAT POSITION NEEDS TO BE HIRED THERE'S PAPERWORK AND I AND TERMS OF HIRING OPPOSITION GIVING THEM A PAYCHECK. ANY PERSONNEL TRANSACTIONS GETTING THEM RESOURCES AND BUDGETS I T. SUPPORT THAT'S NEEDED FOR THAT INDIVIDUALS TASK AND SO FORTH AND SO ON THEY HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF. OF OVERSIGHT MY I GET THAT BUT RIGHT SINGLES WITH SPIKES WE HAD LIKE SINCE YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT THERE'S AN EXTRA DEMAND LOAD FOR WORK RADICALLY ASSUME THAT DEMAND. SO WHAT IT WHATEVER IT MAY BE SILICON INTO SUMA INTERNALLY. THEN. OBVIOUSLY IS NOT THERE ALL THE TIME WHERE THEY DO THE REST THE TIME NOW WORKLOAD IS DOWN BY PULLING THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT. FOR ALL THE PORTS AND HEROES WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE EFFICIENCIES IN TERMS OF OUR COST BEING GENERALLY LOWER BUT IT ALSO SERVES AS A WAY TO BALANCE. THE PEAKS AND VALLEYS OF THE THIRTY PORTS AND BUREAUS SO. AND ALL THE SYSTEM WORKS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR ONE BORDER BUREAU MAY PICK UP A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN ANOTHER BUT. AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS INDICATED THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT YEAR OVER YEAR AND SEWER ONE BOARD OR BUREAU ME PEAK. AND. BYPASSED EUROPEAN IT MAY BE A DIFFERENT STORY IN THE NEXT YEAR BUT OVER TIME IT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO ALLOCATE CENTRO I SERVICES AND SOMETHING THAT'S USE WIDESPREAD. AMONG MANY MANY DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION SO OPPOSITION THE FUNCTIONS WILL BE ELIMINATED AS A RESULT OF THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER PROPOSAL. THAT FOR THE REDUCES DCA CENTRALIZED ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. AND WE ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT WE ARE SOLICITING INFORMATION FROM A WORK GROUP. ADAM SO WE HAVE INVITED FORWARD AND BUREAU STAFF TO TIME ASSIST US AND WHAT A SNOW THERE. RECOMMENDATIONS ON ITEMS THAT WE COULD REDUCE OR ELIMINATE IN THE FUTURE YEARS SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND CONSISTENT MESSAGES WITH WHAT WILL THEY WOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE OUR RESOURCES. PILOTED TOWARD AND IF WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AYE IN THE ONGOING YEARS THEN WE WILL BRING THEM TO THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE BCP PROCESS OF THAT. ADDITIONAL STAFF CAN BE VETTED AT THAT TIME AND AND ON A MORE FOCUSED BASIS INCOMES IN THE COMMITTEE. NICHOLAS THE PUBLIC. GOING CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT THEY SHOULD BE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW MUCH BOARDS AND GIRLS ARE BEING CHARGED FOR DC SERVICES. AND HOW MUCH OF SERVICES THEY USE COMPARED TO OTHERS. LEGISLATORS LEFT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS PROPOSAL TO SEE IF THERE'S AN APPROACH THAT WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. WHEN ALL THIS ITEM OPEN. SALUTE OUR FILE ITEM WHICH IS THE. BREEZE SYSTEM GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ALAN HONOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT'S BCP TO SUPPORT FREE SYSTEM MAINTENANCE. DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS IS REQUESTING APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY. STEAM POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOR THE SUPPORT OF PRES MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS. APPROVAL OF THIS REQUEST WILL ENSURE THAT THE EXISTING STATE CIVIL SERVICE RESOURCES AND STRATEGICALLY DECREASING VENDOR RESOURCES CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE BOARD IN HEROES WHO USED TO PRE SYSTEM. TO CONDUCT DATED A BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. FOR CONTEXT IN FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN FUNDING TO SUPPORT PRES MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS. AS IDENTIFIED IN SECTION EIGHT OF THE BCP. ASIDE FROM MAKING ITS OPERATIONS FUNDING FUNDING IN THE AMOUNT OF THREE POINT THREE MILLION IS BEING REQUESTED TO PAY THE CREDIT CARD PROCESSING FEES THAT ARE INCURRED WHEN SOMEBODY APPLIES ONLINE TO THE SYSTEM. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE ON THIS REQUEST ELLIOTT. WE HAVE THEIR CONCERNS FINANCE I THINK OUT INCLUSIVELY COMMITTEE. IF YOU THANK YOU OF YOUR BACK. A I THINK WHEN WE WERE ALL ASPECTS HERE WE STARTED A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BEING ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A. PROJECT THAT HAD TAKEN MUCH LONGER THAN WE EXPECTED AND JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE CONTEXT HER COLLEAGUES I KNOW IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET ESSENTIALLY TRIPLED. AND. HAS TAKEN A LONG TIME SO A COUPLE QUESTIONS WHAT IS THE TOTAL BUDGET AT THIS POINT IT WAS NOT IN THE. THE TOTAL BUDGET FOR THE PROJECT AND SO I DON'T HAVE IT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE PEER WHICH WAS SUBMITTED. I BELIEVE LAST YEAR NAM AS THE PROJECT FACES BEEN A CLOSED OUT THIS FUNDING IS FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF THE EIGHTEEN EXISTING BOARDS AND BUREAUS WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP WITH THAT INFORMATION ON THE TOTAL TOTAL PROJECT TRYING TO GET BIG PICTURE. ACTIVITY GARCIA DEPARTMENT FINANCE I NINETY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION POINT FIVE OKAY ASSERTIVE AND WHAT WAS PURPORTED ON THE PIER. GOTCHA AND AT THIS POINT THERE EIGHTEEN PORTS AND BUREAUS THAT USE PRE SOMEHOW ANYMORE STILL NEED TO COME ON. SIXTEEN SIXTEEN AND WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THAT. OF THE PLAN FOR THAT IS ENCAPSULATED IN OUR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION OTHERS LIKE ME TO GO INTO A LITTLE DETAIL CURRENT LOVE TO HEAR THAT AND ARE. IN NO LATE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AFTER SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING IN STABILIZING BREEZE RELEASED TO. US I'M SORRY JASON WHICH ONLY DEPARTMENT OF. CONSUMER AFFAIRS PRIVILEGE ICE. THE DEPARTMENT TURNED ITS FOCUS TO RELEASED THREE THE SIXTEEN PROGRAMS THAT EUROPE OF. ENQUIRING ABOUT OVER THE FIRST QUARTER OF A FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPED A STRUCTURED METHODOLOGY FOR THE RELEASE THREE. PROGRAMS EXCUSE ME. PROGRAM TO DOCUMENT ANALYZE. AND CHOOSE AN APPROPRIATE AND COST EFFECTIVE REPLACEMENT FOR THEIR LEGACY SYSTEMS. WE DEVELOPED THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN A SINGLE DOCUMENT. OUTLINING STRUCTURE AND GUARD RAILS FOR THE RELEASE THREE PROGRAMS WE ALSO DEVELOPED SIXTEEN DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODERNIZATION REPORTS. AN INDIVIDUALIZED DOCUMENT SPECIFIC TO EACH PROGRAM. THESE REPORTS INCLUDED INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAM'S OVERALL READINESS. AND INTRODUCTION TO CHANGE MANAGEMENT AND PROPOSED SCHEDULES. THE PLAN IN SIXTEEN REPORTS WERE DELIVERED TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEES IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THE FIRST STEP OF THE MODERNIZATION PLANS TO DOCUMENT ALL BUSINESS PROCESSES TO DETERMINE SPECIFIC BUSINESS FUNCTION REQUIREMENTS. FIVE PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN THESE ACTIVITIES. YOU'RE OF BOARD OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY AND THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD. THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS IS THE PAL PROCESS THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE WHICH IS REQUIRED APPROVAL PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. CURRENTLY ONE PROGRAM THE BOARD OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IS IN THE PAL PROCESS HAS SUBMITTED AND A. AND HAS GAINED APPROVAL FOR THE STAGE ONE OF THE POWER PROCESS. AND THREE OTHERS ARE CURRENTLY DRAFTING AND OF GOING TO SUBMIT IN THE NEAR FUTURE STAGE ONE OF THE POWER PROCESS THOSE ARE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS. AND THE FIDUCIARY BUREAU. VIS AD IF I I DON'T KNOW IF I MENTIONED IT BUT A LOT PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS COMPLETED IT THE STAGE ONE BUSINESS AND HOUSES FOR PAL. HAS ACHIEVED. DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY APPROVAL AND IS. SOON GOING TO SUBMIT STAGE TWO OF THAT POWER PROCESS. OTHER ELAINE LATELY JUST CERTAIN ARE UP BUT I JUST TO LOVE FEEDER JUST BREAK IT DOWN INTO. NUMBER CRADDICK ENGLISH SO WE'VE SIXTEEN APARTMENTS LEFT HOW LONG IT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO GET ALL THOSE UP ON BREEZE. I'M HEARING DIFFERENT STAGES OF THINGS AND. DIFFERENT ACRONYMS AND AND DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND DIFFERENT FACES BUT WHAT IS THIS WHAT IS THIS MADE FOR ONE IT'S GONNA GET OUT. THE PROPOSED SCHEDULE SPAN. IMPLEMENTATION BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. OKAY SO IT'LL IT'LL TAKE SIX MORE YEARS TO GET THE REMAINING EIGHTEEN UP ONBOARD. SO THIS PROJECT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. SO WE'LL TAKE THIRTEEN YEARS TO GET THIS PROJECT DONE. THIS PROJECT OF BEING A SEPARATE PROJECT FROM THE INITIAL BREEZE. AND OF THIS SCHOOL THE INITIAL PRES WAS SUPPOSED TO CAPTURE ALL DEPARTMENTS UNDER THE SEA HAS AUTHORITY RIGHT CORRECT AFTER TO FIT JANUARY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT NUMBER THREE A THREE POINT ONE. OF REMOVED THOSE EIGHTEEN AT THAT TIME SIXTEEN NOW PROGRAMS FROM THE PROJECT. REMOVE HIM BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO HARD. REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT RELEASED ONE BROUGHT. AND. DECISION MAKERS FELT THAT THAT WAS APPROVED IN A DECISION TO MAKE AT THE TIME. OKAY. AND HOW MUCH ARE WE EXPECTED TO SPEND ON THIS BETWEEN NOW AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR V. A DOLLARS WILL BE VETTED THROUGH THE FAW IS FISCAL ANALYSIS WORKSHEETS. WITHIN THE PAL PROCESS STAGE TWO OF THE POWER PROCESS WE DON'T KNOW. DO NOT OKAY WHAT'S YOUR GUESS. I COULDN'T HAVE HAD A CONCERT SO I I RAISES QUESTIONS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A PROJECT THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TWENTY MILLION WERE NOW AT NINETY. IT'S MILLION WERE HALFWAY DONE OR NOT TO BE FINISHED UNTIL ALL OF US GET TURNED OUT OF OFFICE CLOSE TO IT. I'M I. I KNOW I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD COLLEAGUES I'M JUST. TRYING TO GET A HANDLE OF HOW WE GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THESE PROJECTS I'M LOOKING AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF LOOKING AT ALEJO. IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS WOULD LOVE THEM I COULD JUST CONTINUE EVERY TIME ONE OF THESE MAJOR PROJECTS COME THROUGH THE SUBCOMMITTEE BUT I'M GETTING CLOSE TO THE POINT WHERE I MAY START VOTING AGAINST THESE PROJECTS I JUST WANNA. WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE IT IT IT JUST IT IT'S IT'S TESTING THE PATIENCE OF THIS COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY IT MAY. I I I APPRECIATE THAT. IN JUST TO. YOU SAID. REMOVE THE BUREAUCRATIC SPEAK. I AM VERY HAPPY TO DO THAT THE BUSINESS MONETIZATION STRUCTURE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE REMAINING SIXTEEN PROGRAMS. IS THE PATH FORWARD TO SUCCESSFUL IT IMPLEMENTATION EARLY SIGNS WITH THE BUSINESSES SPECIFICALLY HAVE SHOWN. GREAT SUCCESS GREAT ADOPTION EARLY STAGES MIND YOU. BUT SAID THE THREE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE GOT TAKEN THROUGH BUSINESS ACTIVITIES HAVE SHOWN. A ENGAGEMENT LEVEL THAT IS VERY HIGH AS WELL AS IT. EXCITEMENT LEVEL MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE OFF BUT AND EXCITEMENT LEVEL BECAUSE THEY'RE IDENTIFYING THEIR BUSINESS PROCESSES LIKE HAVING DONE IN THE PAST AND THEY'RE REALIZING EFFICIENCIES. AND THEY'RE REALIZING A PATHWAY FOR TO A SUCCESSFUL IT IMPLEMENTATION WHICH BEGINS WITH KNOWING THEIR BUSINESS I'M I HAVE SEVERAL QUOTES ON THAT I WILL READ TO YOU BUT TESTIMONIALS FROM THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH. SO FAR. THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS. AS WELL AS THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY THAT FULLY SUPPORT THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROCESS SO I. AGREE WITH YOUR FRUSTRATION. I AGREE WITH YOUR UP THAT SENTIMENT ABOUT PIC PATIENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE PATH FORWARD TO SUCCESS WHY TEAM IMPLEMENTATION WITH THE REMAINING SIXTEEN PROGRAMS. THE TIME AND. DOES SEEM WILL EXTEND OUT AND WE BELIEVE THAT TIME WILL BE WELL SPENT WITH THE PATH THAT WE SET OUT. IS THERE ANY WAY TO PULL THAT TIME FRAME OF SIX YEARS. SELECT TO YOU I MEAN AGAIN WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE LOOKING. TO. GET HELPED BY. STATE ON THIS SO THAT IF THERE'S A REASON YOU'RE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY. INTERACTING WITH JUST FIVE OF THE SIXTEEN UNITS FOR NOW RIGHT NEXT TWO YEARS YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY DOING THEM THAT WAY AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO. CORRECT TACKLE THEM TOGETHER AND SO I THINK YOU'RE ASK BY CONTRACT IN THE TIME FRAME IS IT POSSIBLE. BUT OF COURSE EVERYTHING IS PUT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WHAT WE WOULD ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON IS THE ORGANIZATIONAL READINESS WERE LOOKING AT EACH BOREDOM BUREAU TALKING WITH THEIR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. THEIR BOARD MEMBER THEIR BOARD LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS OUR STAFF TO SAY CAN YOU SUPPORT THIS PROJECT. FISCALLY STAFF AND. THE TIME COMMITMENT REQUIRED AND IF THEY ARE AT ALL SAY NO THEN WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OBSTACLES IN BRICK WALLS THAT WHEN WRITING TO DOWN THE LINE. SO WE WORK WITH THEM TO GET THEM MORE ORGANIZATIONALLY READY LIKE I SAID THE EARLY ADOPTERS THE FIVE OR SO THAT I RAN OFF. THEY WE WENT THROUGH WITH CHANGE MANAGEMENT WE WENT THROUGH WHAT TO EXPECT. DURING A PROJECT LIKE THIS AND AFTER THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS THERE WERE STILL EAGER IT TO COMMIT THE RESOURCES TO MOVE FORWARD. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING EARLY SUCCESSES WITH THIS CONTRACTING THE TIME SCHEDULE. I'LL BE HAPPY TO TRY TO FIGHT FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONTRACT THE TIME SCHEDULE. WOULD REQUIRE RESOURCES AT THIS TIME THAT I'M I'M UNAWARE OF AND THE ORGANIZATIONAL READINESS ACTS ASPECT IS OF COURSE. IN THE BOREDOM BUREAU ARENA. SO I'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT FOR YOU AND IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY ARE. DOLLARS TO HELP WITH SUPPORT IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THE OPERATION ONGOING. SO IS THIS THE LEVEL OF ONGOING EXPENDITURES WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE SPENDING SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS NEXT YEAR. EXCEPT TRY OUT INTO THE FUTURE IT IT'S A IT'S A GRADUAL DECLINE YEAH THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT REACHES ITS BASELINE. AND ON OF FIVE POINT SEVEN. THAT IRAQ WAIT SEVEN MILLION. AND THAT IS SIMPLY FOR SOFTWARE LICENSING WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WILL EXIST FOR. AS LONG AS WE REALIZE A SYSTEM AND STATE P. WISE TO SUPPORT THAT SYSTEM. THAT. DECLINE COMES AS WE ARE. DECREASING. CONTRACT WORK I AM TAKING ON. MORE OF THE WORK OURSELVES IF THE STATE STAFF WHICH THAT LINE HAS GONE UP OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. SEAN CAN YOU SHARE ANY STATISTICS IN THAT AREA SHARON FIFTEEN SIXTEEN OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM CHANGES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED AS REQUESTED BY THE BOARDS AND BUREAUS USING BREEZE. FORTY FIVE PERCENT AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WERE DONE EXCLUSIVELY BY STATE STAFF I IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT NUMBER ROSE TO SIXTY TWO PERCENT. WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER ON. JUST EARLIER THIS MONTH AND READ ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT THIS FISCAL YEAR FOR TOTAL NUMBER OF SYSTEM CHANGES DONE ENTIRELY BY STATE STOP WITHOUT CONTRACTOR VENDOR RESOURCES. OKAY BUT AND AND WE DON'T AGAIN HAVE A BUDGET OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET THE LAST SIXTEEN. BOARDS APPEARS UP AND RUNNING BUT WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE WHAT THE ONGOING COSTS ARE GOING TO BE. CHAU GOING TOTAL TOTAL OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE DOLLARS. THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FORTY OF A SENSE OF WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE. I BELIEVE THAT OUTLINED IN TABLE THREE OF THE OF THAT PAGE THREE OF THE VCP IN TABLE THREE WE ARE. WE PUT TOGETHER THE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTY ARE WE DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF US SORRY. WE HAVE THAT TABLE IT'S I JUST READ IN THE YEAH SURE SO FLOWER ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS IN ADDITION TO THAT THE AMOUNTS I MENTIONED. NINE POINT THREE MILLION TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO EIGHT POINT FOUR AND INTO THE BASELINE LEVEL OF FIVE POINT SEVEN SO WHAT'S THAT TOTAL OR IF I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. WHAT WE LEVEL OF SPENT BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MINUS THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS FOR THE NUMBERS YOU DON'T KNOW? YOU MEAN THAT INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS YEAH. TWENTY SIX. TWENTY SIX MILLION IF ONLY SIX MILLION OF ASSETS TWENTY SIX MILLION ON TOP OF WAS NINETY SIX MILLION. WHICH IS HOW MUCH IT COSTS OR TALK IN A HUNDRED AND. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR BREEZE PROJECT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO COST TWENTY. TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. ON I HIGH RAISES I'M NOT REALLY SURE I JUST KEEP I KEEP RAISING THIS I'M NOT. YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT MAYBE I GET TIRED OF IT BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO OUR COLLEAGUES AT. THE SIR THESE ARE BUDGET EXPENDITURES THAT. IF WE KNEW IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THOSE DECISIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AND AND FRANKLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SITTING HERE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. I'M WONDERING WHETHER WE WANT TO COMMIT TO THESE TYPES OF DOLLARS THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. ONE A NUMBER OF US. YOU KNOW. WILL BE OUR TENTH OR TWELFTH YEAR. ARM I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS. ONE QUESTION ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST OF STAFF IF POSSIBLE IN THE BACKGROUND. FUTURE. IF IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO PUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR THESE PROJECTS BECAUSE I THINK THE SUMMARY THAT WE HAVE. GIVES A A SNAPSHOT OF EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE TODAY BUT DOESN'T TELL US WHAT THE LONGEVITY IS. BUT. CLEARLY FROM ONE PERSPECTIVE SIDE. WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING RIGHT AND I I'M I'M NOT SURE WE DO NEXT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT. WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO TACKLE THESE LARGE IT PROJECTS YOU HAVE HURT ME. A TALK ABOUT THIS EVERY TWO WEEKS WITH ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WITH ANOTHER LARGE IT INFRASTRUCTURE. IMPLEMENTATION. THE ELF ALSO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS I DON'T HAVE MUCH STATE IN MUCH FAITH IN THE STATE I TEAM. BECAUSE WE COME. PROJECT AFTER PROJECT THAT'S OVER COST OVERRUN IN THIS DOESN'T REALLY GIVE CHIU SNAPSHOT. WAS OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHEN I FIRST STARTED IN IN WE TURN OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE THIRD OF OUR WAY THROUGH THIS STILL WILL NOT BE DONE. AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S SUBSTITUTING IT IT'S A IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY IT'S YOU KNOW IF THIS WAS. A PRIVATE BUSINESS. YOU KNOW I JUST. WE WE CAN FUNCTION. AND IT'S JUST IT'S AS IF IT BEST IS DYSFUNCTIONAL. YOU KNOW SO I I. I'M FRUSTRATED WHEN WE'RE ALL FRUSTRATED APPEARED I AGREED LIKELY WE SHOULDN'T BOTH THESE PROJECTS. AT SOME POINT AND WE'RE GONNA BE HERE FOR A WHILE STILL SO. WE STOPPED RUNNING IT. MR SHAPIRO. ACTUALLY I'M NOT PROBABLY BRINGS IT BUT A GOOD SUBJECT FOR A HEARING IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO HAVE. THAT THE. TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT COME AND TALK TO US ABOUT HOW THEY'VE CHANGED THE PROCUREMENT METHOD. BECAUSE THIS PROCUREMENT METHOD WAS THE OLD METHOD. THAT WAS UTILIZED WHICH IS YOU OUGHT YOU FIGURED OUT. IT'S IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A METHOD WHERE YOU USE YOU SAY HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. SO WE'RE GONNA BY WHAT WE KNOW. AND THEN YOU GET BIDS FOR THAT. AND THEN. IT TAKES IT'S IT IT'S AT LEAST A THREE YEAR PROCESS TO PUT THEM TO BED THAT ARE OF PIECE TOGETHER TO GO OUT TO GET THE BIDS IN AND RUN IT THROUGH. THE WAY THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE DEALS WITH THAT SO THAT WEEK THAT LEGISLATURE GETS INFORMATION. AND SO BY THE TIME THE LEGISLATURE'S IS PUTTING THE STAMP OF APPROVAL THE PROJECT HAS BEEN. IN OPERATION FOR LIKE FOUR YEARS SOME BUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN THEY START BUILDING IT. AND. AND THE CHALLENGE IS IT THAT IT THAT TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY OLD NUMBER ONE. IT'S UNKNOWN TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS AVAILABLE FIVE YEARS BEFORE AND SO TO THE TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED. AND SO ON AND. AND FRANKLY. IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS THAT EACH BOARD. HAD TO DETERMINE WHAT CHANGES THEY WOULD MAKE IN THEIR PROCESS SEIZE IN ORDER FOR THE FOR THEM TO THEN GIVE ADVICE. TO THE DEVELOPERS OF THE OF THE PLATFORM FOR THEIR BOARD. AND THEY IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO KNOW WHAT PROCESS SEES IT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SKILL SETS TO TO KNOW AND SO WE WERE WEIRD IT'S LIKE WE'RE DEALING WITH. WITH FORTY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THIS SO. THE PROCESSES CHANGED I KNOW IT'S CHANGED I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S TECHNOLOGY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WILL BE BUYING UNDER THAT SYSTEM ANY LONGER AND SO WOULD BE GOOD FOR US TO HAVE. I PRESENTATION SO WE CAN SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THAT THE NEW SYSTEM ENTAILS BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU IT IS FRUSTRATING YOU LOOK AT IT IT IT DIDN'T. OUT WORK WELL FOR MANY OF THE OF THE BOARDS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T DO THE ADVANCE PLANNING AND THEY JUST BASICALLY SAID HERE'S OUR PROCESSES. THERE TWENTY FIVE STEPS TO GET LICENSING AND SO WE'RE JUST CREATE THOSE TWENTY FIVE STEPS ON THE COULD HAVE REDONE THEIR. THEIR PROCESS AND HAVE HAD SOME EFFICIENCY NOT AGREEING GOING FOR LEASE IT PROJECTS WE SHOULD HAVE A. A BETTER SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ENTIRE PROCESS FROM DAY ONE THROUGH EMAIL BECAUSE IT WISE WE. THE US WERE ASKING WHERE A SINGLES OLD BCP'S. THAT'S OVER A MILLION NOW SO LESSEN MY AGATHA BB REQUEST THE COMMITTEE FOR FUTURE. I TO PROJECTS TO KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE INTO IT. AND AND I JUST THINK THAT IT'S IT'S BETTER IF WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT. THAT THE PROCUREMENT THE RFP. THE REASON THAT WE DO IT THAT WAY OR DID IT THAT WAY IT IT WORKS REALLY GOOD FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT BUT DOESN'T WORK REAL GOOD FOR AN IT PROJECT AND. THE CHALLENGES THAT THE REASON THAT WE DO IT THAT WAY SO THAT EVERYBODY GETS TO SEE WHAT THAT HIGH BID IS OR THE LOW BID I'M SORRY. AND YOU CAN LOOK AT APPLES TO APPLES TO ORANGES AND. TO DO I KEY PROJECTS THAT WE DID THAT MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME SURE. SO THERE'S NO COMMENTS WERE HOLES ITEM OPEN. DOCTOR CHOI. THERE REALLY ARE FRUSTRATING TO HEAR THAT YOU KNOW COST WISE I AM AND THE MESSED MESSIAH SO WRONG AND I EACH YEAR. THE OPERATING COST CLOSE UP BOMB IN THE PROCUREMENT OF CLOSE CLOSE UP BUT. I WONDER IF WHAT THIS US OFF TO A SLOW OR DEVELOP THE IN HOUSE SO WHAT DO YOU GO OUTSIDE LIKE A PROCUREMENT THROUGH UPDATING. AND AND AT THE SAME TIME THE NUMBER OF WILL USE THAT MEMBERS ARE OF YOU KNOW GROWING FORTY THREE PERCENT DAILY. POSITIONS SO YOU ARE REQUESTING HERE. AND AND THIS IS I DON'T HAVE A MUCH BACKGROUND ON HOW A NEW OPERATIONS SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME. THIS UNNECESSARY AYE TO SELF TO HEAR AS YOU'VE LA TRY TO. TO UPDATE THE IS IT INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT. OR OR IT IS IT'S A POWER P. THAT THE U. QUARK DEFENDERS. SO. AT THE TIME OF THE. PROJECTS PHASE OF THE BREACH OF PRES. WE PROCURED A COMMERCIAL OFF THE SHELF SYSTEMS SO IT'S A SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED ON AND BUILT TO DO. ENFORCEMENT AND LICENSING BUSINESS PROCESSES FOR. FOR ENTITIES SUCH AS THOSE THAT USE IT WITHIN A DEPARTMENT TUMOR FAIRS. ITS CONFIGURABLE SO IT'S IT'S NOT. INTENDED TO BE CUSTOM CODED. WE BROUGHT IN A SOLUTION VENDER UM ACCENTURE TO CONFIGURE THE SYSTEM DURING THE PROJECT PHASE. THEY HAVE BEEN RETAINED AT A LESSER LEVEL THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS PHASE. THE. CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW I QUOTED SOME STEPS IN NUMBERS ABOUT. THAT STATE STAFF. HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN THEIR CAPABILITY TO ENTIRELY MAIN MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM ON OUR OWN WHICH THAT IS THE. THAT GOAL AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRENDING TOWARDS WITH ON NEARLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL THE SYSTEM CHANGE REQUESTS IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR BEING DONE ENTIRELY BY STATE STAFF. ON THE FORTY THREE POSITIONS ON THAT YOU REFERENCED I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT THOSE ARE. NOT ADDITIONAL TO WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WE ONLY RECEIVED FUNDING FOR ONE BUDGET YEAR LAST YEAR SO I'M WE ARE SIMPLY CONTINUING UMP REQUESTING CONTINUING FUNDING OF THIS FORTY THREE POSITIONS. ON THAT WE THAT WE HAVE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. ONCE YOU APPROVED PROCURE WORTH A SYSTEM USES SOME AYE IT IS THAT MAINTAINED A BY OUR INTERNAL STAFF OR DO YOU. A CONTRACT OUT THAT THOUGH WHICHEVER THE SYSTEM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO PURCHASE SAID THAT THERE OUTSIDE OF VENDOR. THROUGH CONTRACT FIVE USE A TENURE SAID THEY'D DO THEY MAINTAIN. ON THAT DETERMINATION WILL BE MADE AS WE GO THROUGH THE. PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IF A SOLUTION WAS SELECTED THROUGH THAT PROCESS SUCH AS PRES. WE WOULD HAVE EXPERTISE IN HOUSE AND WE WOULD LOOK AT THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE THAT EXPERTISE. TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CONSCIOUS. CONTRACTOR RESOURCE THAT WOULD BE. BRING ONBOARD BUT THAT WOULD BE DETERMINED THROUGH THE PROJECT APPROVAL I MEAN MY AUTONOMOUS INSIST THAT THOUGH WHATEVER THE SYSTEM YOU HAPPEN TO CHOOSE TO AND AND THEN THE. NUMBER WILL APPEAR AT THE MAINTENANCE APPEARING TO FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS. IN THE CONTRACTING OUT THE LEFT AND THE RESPONSE BUT MAINTAINING THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO INCREASE OUR INTERNAL STAFF MEMBERS AND THE COSTING. YOU KNOW BUDGET JUSTICE OFTEN QUOTE COSCO'S CLOSE UP BY YOU MAINTENANCE OF PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON ADDING NEW PEOPLE AND KEEP AND TRY TO TRAIN THEM. YOU KNOW IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO ME. I UNDERSTAND. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CLAIRE I'M A NURSE I LIVE IN SOLANO COUNTY AND AM. I WORKING ALAMEDA COUNTY AND FACULTY ACOSTA EAST BAY. AN ACID AND HOP UP QUICKLY ENOUGH FOR THE PREVIOUS ITEM BUT THIS HAS TO DO BOTH WITH THE BEER AND WITHIN THE DCA. I'M SO RECENTLY EFFECTIVE APRIL FIFTH THE BR INCREASE LICENSING FEES QUITE INEQUITABLE  <u><c.green>AGAINST</c></u> PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND NURSING STUDENTS INTERESTED IN PUBLIC HEALTH. SO. MY COMMENT IS REALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE. ILIO AMONG RECOMMENDATION ABOUT REVIEWING AND THE. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PRODUCT COSTS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT BR AND INCREASED FEES. BECAUSE IT IS REALLY AN EQUITABLE AND BASED ON A SURVEY MY COLLEAGUES AND I DID THIS PAST SIXTIES. SIX PERCENT OF NURSING STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WILL CONTINUE IN THEIR CAREER SO IT REALLY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. OKAY. WHEN ELSE. OKAY PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. THE FINAL QUESTION HOW LONG HAVE THE TWO OF YOU BETTER AT DCA. I'VE BEEN AT DCA SINCE. IN MY CURRENT POSITION TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND. MID. THIRTEEN OCCUR IN A TWO THOUSAND. I'M IN MY CURRENT POSITION. BLADES TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT WITH DCA SINCE ARE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND WORKING AT A BOARDING NONE MOVING INTO IT IN TWENTY TEN I I ASK I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN. YOUR NAY DIRECTOR OF AND THAT BEING SAID I KNOW THAT BUREAUCRACIES ARE SLOW TO MOVE. AND. AND THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT HAVE. HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE BEFORE BOTH YOUR TIME. THEY WILL PROBABLY MAYBE AROUND AFTER TIME I JUST HAPPEN TO READ THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT WHICH WAS UNBELIEVABLY SKATING ABOUT WHAT WAS NOT HAPPENING. JUST A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME WHAT KIND OF HEADWAY SPIN MADE SO. I I'M I'M SURE THAT THE TWO OF YOU HERE MESSENGERS. IT BUT. BUT WE DO NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS. OVER TIME IT'S MY PERSPECTIVE WE ARE PROBABLY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING ON ON WASTEFUL IT PROJECTS AND. AND. THOSE OF US ON THIS SIDE OF THE AISLE WE WILL KEEP REYES NET BUT AT SOME POINT WE'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT WHERE THE RIVERS CAN HIT THE ROAD AND HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND I. LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS AND IDEAS HOPEFULLY FROM SOME OF THE OTHER. OVERSIGHT AGENCIES IN FISCAL AGENCIES AND WHAT WE CAN DO. WITH ANALYSTS ARE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. THAT IS TODAY'S FINAL ITEM. WE ARE NOW YOU'RE YEAH. YEAH I WASN'T I WASN'T ENTIRELY SURE. OKAY HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED. FROM WHERE THEY ALL LIVED THROUGH. OUT THE WORLD BY. I WASN'T REALLY FAIRLY. YEAH. HAVE. THEY TOOK
