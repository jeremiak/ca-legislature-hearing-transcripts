OUR FIRST ISSUE TODAY IS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE BUDGET PROPOSALS. OUR PANELISTS INCLUDE. JULIE ACROSS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. BRIAN WITH THE FORD WITH ALEJO AND CHARLENE MANNING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LET'S GET STARTED. AS MISS CROSSING THE LINE. LET'S START OVER LET'S CROSS I THINK WE'RE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH YOUR AUDIO. CAN HAVE YOU COME FROM ONE TO FIVE. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE GREAT THANK YOU MISS CROSS WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW LET'S GET STARTED. OKAY GREAT. SORRY ABOUT THAT. ALL RIGHT MY NAME IS JULIE ACROSS AND THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OVER THE ADMINISTRATION AND LICENSING SERVICES BRANCH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU TODAY I'LL START WITH OUR CONTINUATION OF ENHANCE FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS IN PREVENTION BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. CDI MONITORS AND PROSECUTE SO HE CAN ACTIONS ALSO REFERRED TO AS WELL AS A LOWER CASES MR FILED UNDER THE INSURANCE FRAUD PREVENTION ACT PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA INSURANCE CODE. SECTION EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE POINT SEVEN. THIS STATUTE ANY ASSESSMENTS AND FEES AWARDED FOR THESE CASES. PAGE THE GENERAL FUND. SAME STATUTE ALSO PER FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO. THESE FUNDS TO DECEIVE. TO BE USED FOR ENHANCE FRAUD INVESTIGATION. SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THE DEPARTMENT HAS COLLECTED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS. ADULT IN MORE THAN SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS PAID TO THE GENERAL FUND. ON REVENUE COLLECTION WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE RESOURCES CDI HAS RECEIVED OR THE RESOURCES THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY SEEKING. ON THE FLIP SIDE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THIS FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROVED MULTIPLE ONE TIME REQUESTS TOTALING ALMOST FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND UP TO FIFTY POSITIONS TO UTILIZE THESE FUNDS FOR ENHANCE FRAUD INVESTIGATION PREVENTION. OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS HE HAS DEMONSTRATED A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF MAKING RECOVERIES FOR THE GENERAL FUND AS A RESULT OF OUR WHISTLEBLOWER LITIGATION. HELLO MORE THAN COVER OUR RESOURCE REQUEST OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE COLLECTED AN AVERAGE OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE'VE ALREADY COLLECTED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AS A RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS. WE'RE REQUESTING SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. TO CONVERT THIRTY FOUR EXPIRING LIMITED TERM POSITION. TO PERMANENT POSITION TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THIS PROGRAM. AND ALSO SIX HUNDRED FORTY. SIX HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND EVERY THREE YEARS. BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TO CONTINUE OUR SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE SUBSCRIPTION OUR E. DISCOVERY PROGRAM. WALL OF OUR PREVIOUS FUNNY REQUESTED PAGE PER LIMITED TERM FUNDING THE LIMITED TERM STATUS OF THE FUNDING IS NO LONGER UPROOTED AND IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE PROGRAM AND THE STATE'S INTEREST. IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE A PERMANENT ONGOING APPROPRIATION TO CDI FOR THIS DEDICATED FUND SOURCE TO SUPPORT DEPARTMENTS ENHANCED FRAUD INVESTIGATION PREVENTION EFFORTS. SECURING PERMANENT FUNDING WILL PROVIDE MORE CONTINUITY IN THE PROGRAM RESULTING IN BETTER OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF MONETARY IMPLICATING WHISTLEBLOWER CASES AND DETERRING INVESTIGATING FRAUD WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL RESULT IN GREATER RECHARGE THE GENERAL FUND. THIS IN TURN WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS BY PROTECTING THEM FROM FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES AND HELPS TO INSULATE ONSUMERS FROM THE ULTIMATE COST OF INSURANCE FRAUD. WHICH IS PASSED ON TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND FEES SO WHAT WE DO WITH THESE RESOURCES AND WHAT ARE ENHANCE FRAUD INVESTIGATION AND PREVENTION EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE. IT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR IT WAS A QUIRKY SAYS. IT ALSO PROVIDES FUNDING TO INVESTIGATE SUSPECTED FRAUD WE USE THIS MONEY TO PUT EMPHASIS ON. OUR CASES HAVE IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SUSPECTED LOSSES INVOLVING THREE OR MORE VICTIMS SO THESE ARE HIGHER IMPACT FRAUD CASES. AS WELL AS ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF OUR FRAUD DATA ANALYTICS SYSTEM WHICH WE IMPLEMENTED USING PRIOR GENERAL FUND RESOURCES MADE POSSIBLE BY THE GENERAL FUND KEYCHAIN RECOVERIES AS WELL AS CONTINUING OUR EDISCOVERY SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE SUBSCRIPTION. WHICH IS ANOTHER GREAT ENHANCEMENT THAT WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY PRIOR GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. THE FINDINGS HE HAD HER QUESTION WOULD COME FROM THE KEYCHAIN RECOVERY CDI COLLECTS AS A RESULT OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE PAID TO THE GENERAL FUND. CI'S. CONFIDENT THAT WITH PERMANENT RESOURCE HIS CD I RECOVER. THEY NEED TO COVER PROPOSED EXPENDITURE. NO WE KNOW IMPACT TO JUMP FUND. I MADE A PRICE HERE FOR YOU QUESTIONS THIS FOR OR DO YOU ME TO- CONTINUE NOW WITH THEIR- OVERVIEW OF SECOND. SORRY MY MICROPHONE WAS OFF OF MISCONDUCT YES IF YOU CAN CONTINUE PLEASE THAT BE GREAT.

SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE BROUGHT TD EYES AT THE ALREADY OVER HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE DECISIONS I EXPANDING THE UNIVERSE OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS FOR WHICH INSURERS MUST PROVIDE.

AT THIS TIME WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON OUR PROPOSALS THANK M. S. CROSS LET'S HEAR FROM THE ALLELES. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M BRAND WHETHER FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA THE STATUS PREVIOUSLY FUNDED THESE ENHANCED INSURANCE FRAUD INVESTIGATION AND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS. THE PRIMARY REASON THAT ONGOING FUNDING WAS NOT PROVIDED TO FOUR IS THAT LEGAL JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS NOT A TRADITIONAL RECORDING RECURRING SOURCE OF FUNDING. IN THE AMOUNT FLUCTUATES FROM ONE YEAR TO ANOTHER. AS THE DEPARTMENT INDICATED HOWEVER THERE MAY BE OPERATIONAL BENEFITS FROM FUNDING THE POSITIONS ON THE BUDGET. ON AN ONGOING BASIS INSTEAD OF ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS. FOR EXAMPLE ONGOING FUNNY MAY IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF THE OF THE DEPARTMENT TO RECRUIT. AND RETAIN MORE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN THESE POSITIONS. WE HAVE ANALYZED THE FLOW OF REVENUES FROM LEGAL JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS. HAPPEN PRINCIPLE TO TEN INSURANCE FRAUD CASES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WE HVE DETERMINED THAT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE LEVEL OF ONGOING FUNDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING FOR THEIR ENHANCED INSURANCE FRAUD INVESTIGATION AND FRAUD. PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. BERMAN WE CAN ANSWER- ANY ADDITIONAL YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT. THAT AND WE HAVE NO COMMENT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH ITEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT- MISTER MANNING. OUR ASSORTMENTS MANNING FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SURELY MANNING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THE ENHANCE FRAUD INVESTIGATION AND PREVENTION PROGRAM ON GOING AS IT WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE MARC CASES RETAINED EXPERIENCE ATTORNEYS AND INVESTIGATORS AND RECOVER ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENTS.

THANK YOU FOR THAT MUCH UNDER WITH NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL. THANK YOU FOR THAT AT THE NEXT TO ISSUE IS RELATED TO THE STATE TREASURER ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN ELECTRONIC RESOURCES AUGMENTATION OUR FIRST PANELISTS- IS WITH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. THANK YOU BERMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I AM CHRISTENSEN KELLY MOORE FROM THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE INVESTMENT DIVISION. THE INVESTMENT DIVISION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTING TEMPORARY I DON'T FUNDS THAT ARE PART OF THE POOL OF MONEY INVESTMENT ACCOUNT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE CAMPAñA. ARE PROPOSAL TODAY REQUESTED ONGOING AUGMENTATION OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENTS TO MEET THE INCREASING COSTS OF ELECTRONIC SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO SAFELY AND PRUDENTLY INVEST STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT MONEY FOR THAT PMR YANG. THESE SERVICES INCLUDE SUBSCRIPTIONS TO CREDIT RATING AGENCIES SUCH AS STANDARD AND POOR'S MOODY'S AND FITCH AS WELL AS TO ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORMS SUCH AS BLOOMBERG AND REPRESENTATIVES THAT PROVIDE REAL TIME MARKET PRICING INFORMATION. AMONG OTHER FEATURES VARIOUS DALY AND SUPPLY NEEDED INFORMATION THAT ENSURE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. HELP TO SAFEGUARD BALLOT PRICING OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE PURCHASE AND SELL AND ALSO PREVENT THE PURCHASE OF RISKY SECURITIES. THAT PMI NAY WHICH INCLUDES THE GENERAL FUND SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT FUND AND LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND. GREW BY OVER THIRTY BILLION BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AND IN THIS YEAR HAS RISEN TO OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION GIVEN THE GROWTH THAT THIS ACCOUNT THE ELECTRONIC SUBSCRIPTIONS USED ARE VITAL TO THE TREASURER'S OFFICE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS FUNCTIONS. AND ENSURE THAT IT THE BILL'S OBLIGATIONS FOR SAFE AND PRUDENT INVESTMENT OF TAXPAYER MONEY. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT COSTS FOR ELECTRONICS OF PRESCRIPTIONS HAS INCREASED BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 5210% ANNUALLY. IN OUR CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THESE INCREASES GOING FORWARD- THEREFORE THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATION WOULD ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN CURRENT ELECTRONIC SUBSCRIPTION LEVELS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WITH THE INCREASED REIMBURSEMENTS COMING FROM PARTICIPANTS IN THE CAMPAñA SPECIFICALLY THE SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT FUND AND LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND PARTICIPANTS. THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS INFORMED BY THESE ELECTRONIC SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR PROPOSAL TODAY.

JIM DOYLE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. SEEN NONE I ALSO DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING. AT ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN IS RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE ACT BOARD. OF ISSUE FOURTEEN IS THE CONTINUED ADMINISTRATION OF THE CAL ABLE BOARD LISTS- GO WITH OUR FIRST PANELIST- MISTER DANTE ALLEN. ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DANTE ALLEN I'VE SERVED AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ABLE LIKE BOARD SINCE JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CONGRESS PASSED THE FEDERAL ACHIEVING BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCES THAT. THIS CHANGE TO THE IRS TAX CODE PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO SAVE AND INVEST IN TAX ADVANTAGED ACCOUNTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF BUILDING EQUITY IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE ADDED EXPENSES OF LIVING A LIFE WITH A DISABILITY. THESE ACCOUNTS ALSO PREDICT PROVIDED PROTECTION FOR INDIVIDUALS TO MAINTAIN THEM ELIGIBILITY. FOR GOVERNMENT BENEFIT PROGRAMS LIKE SSI AND MEDICAID. EVEN WHEN EXITING THE ASSET LIMIT. OF THESE PROGRAMS BY ACCUMULATING MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. ABLE PROVIDE THE MUCH NEEDED ECONOMIC BRIDGE FOR PEOPLE DISABILITIES TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY THAT IS FAR TOO COMMON AMONGST THE COMMUNITY. SIMPLY PUT ABLE ALLOWS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO PLAN AND SAVE FOR THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURES IN A WAY THAT WAS NEVER PREVIOUSLY POSSIBLE. CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATION ENABLING THE FORMATION OF CALAIS VOTE WAS PASSED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THE PROGRAM OPEN TO THE PUBLIC IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN. AT THE FORTY FIRST ABLE PROGRAM IN THE NATION. IN OUR FIRST TWO YEARS OF OPERATION NEARLY FORTY TWO HUNDRED TALLY BLOOD COUNTS HAVE BEEN OPENED WITH MORE THAN THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA HAS QUICKLY GROWN GROWN TO THE FIFTH LARGEST ABLE PROGRAM IN BOTH ACCOUNTS AND ASSETS. DESPITE COMING ONLINE THREE YEARS AFTER THE OLDEST AND LARGEST ABLE PROGRAM STATES FIRST BEGAN. WE'RE ON TRACK TO OVERTAKE THEM AND BECOME THE NATION'S LARGEST ABLE PROGRAM. IN THE FIRST YEARS OF OPERATION WE HAVE LEARNED MANY LESSONS- FIRST AMONG THOSE GOOD BACK THERE OBSTACLES IMPEDING ABLE FROM REACHING ITS FULL POTENTIAL- TO BE EMBRACED BY ALL WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. TO BE SURE AWARENESS OF THE PROGRAM IN THE NEED TO INSTILL TRUST- TO BUILD THESE ACCOUNTS STILL EXIST- AN EXPANSION OF THE ABLE ELIGIBLE POPULATION BEYOND THE DISABILITY OUTSIDE OF TWENTY SIX YEARS THEY WERE LEGISLATIVE FIX. IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IS ALSO A KEY DRIVER FOR CONTINUE ABLE SUCCESS. THE OTHER CRITICAL LESSON THAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE BALL IS THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE PRIOR TO ESTABLISHING CALIFORNIA THEY BLACK WERE INACCURATE. THE GROWTH COME AT A SMALLER PLACE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. AND THE WAY THEY WHICH ACCOUNT HOLDERS ARE USING THEIR ACCOUNTS VERY VASTLY. FROM THE FIVE TWENTY NINE COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAM THAT ABEL WAS MODELED AFTER. TRANSACTION A COMPONENT OF ABLE WHICH IS NOT A FEATURE OF COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAMS ME THAT ASSETS HELD IN ABLE ACCOUNTS HAVE GENERATED LESS REVENUE THAN ORIGINALLY PROJECTED. WHICH WILL RESULT IN A LONGER THAN EXPECTED TIMELINE FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE SELF SUSTAINABILITY AND REPAY THE GENERAL FUND LOANS THAT SUPPORT THE PROGRAM SINCE ITS INCEPTION. IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE SELF SUSTAINABILITY AND REPAY THE LOANS THAT ARE FUNDED CAL ABLE ON BEHALF. ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD WE HAVE SUBMITTED A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT REQUEST THAT FUNDING FOR CALLIE WILL SHIFT FROM LOANS TO AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION UNTIL THE- THE POINT THAT THE PROGRAM REACHES SELF SUSTAINABILITY. AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR FUTURE LOANS AND CAPITAL TO LAUNCH FOR REPAYMENT. WITH INVESTMENT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP IN THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF THIS PROGRAM THEN HELP SUPPORT FINANCIAL EQUITY AMONG ONE OF THE STATE'S MOST UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE EXPECT THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION TO COVER SHORTFALLS BETWEEN OPERATING COSTS AND REVENUE GENERATED. UNTIL CELLS WITHIN ABILITY CAN BE REACHED. IN GROWTH OF ACCOUNTS AND ASSETS WILL BE THE KEY DRIVERS FOR SUSTAINABILITY. ONE SELF SUSTAINABLE CALIBER WILL NO LONGER NEED FUNDING FROM THE STATE. AND WHILE CALIBER COULD CONTINUE TO RELY UPON THINKING ADDITIONAL LOANS RATHER THAN A NON. ANNUAL APPROPRIATION OUR CURRENT GROWTH PROJECTIONS ESTIMATE THE PROGRAM WOULD DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF LOANS ALREADY RECEIVED AND EXTEND THE TIME FOR REPAYMENT. I REQUEST FOR AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION IS MODELED AFTER SEVERAL STATES THAT THE POLICY IS BEING PASSED. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE AT THIS POIN. THANK YOU MISTER ALLEN LET'S HEAR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HELLO ARE YOU TO THROW IT THAT WAY OUT- WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL- AS LONG AS THE PROGRAM REMAINS THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FIND THE SHIFT IN APPROACH FROM LOAN TO APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND- THE REASON. AT LEAST UNTIL THE PROGRAM REACHES SELF SUSTAINABILITY- COMMITTEE STAFF NOTED THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER REQUESTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON- WENDY YEAH THAT'S PART OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE TOUGH THE THING ABILITY AND KIND OF ONGOING OVERSIGHT- REGARDING- INSURE WEDNESDAY AT APPROPRIATIONS BILL. FOR AN- THANK YOU FOR THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU KNOW HOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FINANCE SUPPORTS THE PROPOSAL. I'M SORRY ONE MORE TIME. BINANCE SUPPORTS THE PROPOSAL SUPPORT. OKAY THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MISTER COOPER IS MANAGER OF MR ALLEN WAS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND LOANS ISSUE TO DATE. TO DATE WE ARE JUST OVER FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION. AND WHAT'S THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND LOANS REPAID TODAY. ZERO WE HAVE NOT BE GIVEN REPAYMENT OF LONG JET. THE STAFF ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT BASED ON THE CURRENT FEE STRUCTURES IS ESTIMATED EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE REVENUE THE PROGRAM SUSTAINABILITY FOR SOMETIME- ALWAYS THAT'S REASON YOU WANT TO GO FROM THE LOANS TO THE GENERAL FUND MONEY. GIVE AN ESTIMATE ON WHEN THE PROGRAM WILL ACHIEVE SELF SUSTAINABILITY. WE DO WE'VE DONE- GROWTH PROJECTIONS AND LIKE- LIKE I SAID PREVIOUSLY- GROWTH OF THE PROGRAM IN A DOWNTURN OUT THAT. WILL BE THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE- I'M BASED ON TWO SEPARATE SCENARIOS WE SEE THE PROGRAM- IN A MODERATE CASE ACHIEVING SELF SUSTAINABILITY- BY- FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THIRTY- ED ARE LOWER CASE THEY COULD GO OUT- INTO THE TWENTY FORTY. SO WE'RE TALKING A BEST CASE SCENARIO SAID MODERATES GONNA BE TEN YEARS WORST CASE SCENARIO TWENTY YEARS SO I MEAN THE PROGRAMS A VERY WORTHWHILE AND GREAT PROGRAM BUT- STILL WITH. ME WHAT. DO WE HAVE DIRECT TO GUARANTEE AYE I GUESS FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL EVENTUALLY SUCCEED. YEAH THAT SAID SO THEY ARE NEVER QUESTION THAT I THINK THAT THAT IS. A GREAT ISSUE BUT THEIR NUMBER VARIABLES- BUT THE PRIMARY VERY WELL LIKE I SAID IS ELIGIBILITY AND IT'S BEEN BASED ON- THE DISABILITY BEGINNING BEFORE- AND ARBITRARY AGE OF TWENTY SIX- THERE'S BEEN SUBSTANTIAL MOVEMENT ON THAT ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO RAISE THAT TO. FORTY SIX THAT WILL VASTLY IMPROVE THE ELIGIBILITY POPULATION AND COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE GROWTH NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE- PROJECTED CURRENTLY. BOB I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE OVERALL ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROGRAM- HAS BEEN STRONG AND THAT- NATIONWIDE- BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME TO- TO GENERATE THESE- TO GENERATE THE ACCOUNT UP. THE AMOUNT OF- OF GROWTH THAT WE NEED. I THANK YOU YOUR SURE WILL NOT NONE OF US WILL BE HERE AND IN TEN YEARS LEVEL IN TWENTY YEARS SO I GUESS IS JUST TRYING TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE PUBLIC'S MONEY IN OTHER THERE REALLY ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT IT THAT IT WILL DO IT SO AT WHAT POINT- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE- IT'S JUST COMING BACK FROM FOR MORE MONEY- SO WHAT POINT DO WE- DO WE- CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER TEN YEARS BECAUSE- TO A TEN MORE YEARS TILL TWENTY THIRTY. THE PROGRAM ALL BEEN EXISTENCE WHAT. SIXTEEN YEARS- IT'S BEEN EXISTENCE HOW LONG NOW SIX YEARS- IT TOOK TWO YEARS. AGO TWO YEARS THAT OF THOSE TWELVE YEARS SO THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE DIFFICULT PART BECAUSE WHAT'S TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK IN L. LYING YEARS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS BEFORE YOU REACH TWENTY THIRTY. THE WHERE YOU'RE GOING RIGHT NOW THE MODEL THAT CAN. PARDON I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN IT I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE A MODEL THAT WE CAN- COMPARE OURSELVES TO IS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM- WHICH TOOK- SEVEN YEARS AFTER BEGINNING BEFORE- IT REPAID ITS LOANS THERE ARE SOME MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- ESPECIALLY HOURS GIVEN THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE DIFFERENT AND THEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESOURCES THAT ARE HELD IN THESE ACCOUNTS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- BUT THEY ARE SIMILAR TO COMPARE- THAT THEY DID EVENTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL OF SELF SUSTAINABILITY. BUT BUT ON THEIR PRODUCT THEY REPAID THE LOANS YOU'RE ASKING FOR GENERAL FUND MONEY TODAY WHICH WILL NOT BE REPAID. SO THERE'S A STRICTLY JEFF FROM FOR LOANS AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A MIXTURE BECAUSE GOING FOR THE CELLS LIKE IT WILL BE GENERAL FUND LOANS. THIS IS THE GENERAL FUND MONEY. CORRECT AND THAT'S% BUT ONE OF THE- LARGEST ELEMENTS IN THE LOANS THAT WE'VE TAKEN WITH THE START UP COSTS- AND SO- THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN. WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS TO GET THE PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING. OKAY I'LL ACCEPT A SUPPORT THE PROGRAM LASSEN GRAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT YOU KNOW SUSTAINABILITY FOR THE PROGRAM THANK YOU MANAGER. SLACKING YEAH HI I SURE IN THE CONCERN WITH THE CURRENT MODEL THE WAY THAT IT'S SET UP BUT- THE FACT THAT WERE WORRIED OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SUCH A- POWERFUL RETURN I THINK IS- SAD I MEAN. IN ALL HONESTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND MOST THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A VERY SMALL NUMBER. AND WHAT WE GET IN RETURN FOR THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WE NEED TO FIND A DIFFERENT WAY. TO FIND YOUR PROGRAM IS MY OPINION SIR. AND BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU IN WHATEVER WAY. I NEED TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU TO FIND THAT FUNDING STREAM. WHAT THANK YOU LET THAT MISTER LUCKY I HAVE A QUICK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU- MISTER ALAN CAN YOU PLEASE REMIND THE SUBCOMMITTEE WHY A GENERAL FUND LOAN WAS FIRST USE THAN WHY NOT A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS. THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY WITH THE PROGRAM. THAT THAT DOES- PREDATES ME SLIGHTLY- BUT I CAN OFFER- BACK TALLIED BOWL WAS STRUCTURED VERY SIMILARLY TO- THE PREVIOUS- COLLEGE SAVINGS PROGRAMS THAT I'VE MENTIONED- AND SO- PART OF THE RATIONALE IS THAT- THAT. IT IS THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL RESELL SUSTAINABILITY AND BE ABLE TO HAVE- EXCESS IN REVENUE THAT CAN REPAY THOSE LOANS. AND SO THE ABILITY FOR IT TO- TO STAND ON ITS OWN WAS. WAS PRIMARILY DRIVING FORCE. I SEE THANK YOU I'M IN A KNOW THAT YOU TOUCHED UPON IT BRIEFLY BY IT CAN YOU- THE TIMING FOR THE LOAN. AND ALSO A TIE WE THE ON CHEN FUND UP. OLAND SO THE X. IS THAT WE WOULD ACHIEVE SELF SUSTAINABILITY BY- YOU'RE TWENTY THIRTY INCLUDE THAT SO I'M- SORT OF AND A NINE YEAR TIMELINE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- AND- LOAN REPAYMENT WHAT WERE ONCE WE REACH THAT LEVEL OF SELF SUSTAINABILITY- WE WILL NO LONGER. REQUIRE ANY STATE FUNDING- AND USE- ACCESS REVENUE IN ORDER TO FULLY REPAIR BILLS WHILE. SO OUR EXTENDED HORIZON FOR LOAN REPAYMENT WOULD TAKE US TO ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY EIGHT. WELL THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK IT'S INSIGHTFUL TO HEAR- JUST REALLY THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE YES MISTER COOPER YES I- EXCEL NOT BE A HARD BUT YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD BUT MAYBE I'LL AGREE. JUST YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE TO GO TO THE PUBLIC MONEY. MAYBE THERE'S A WAY BECAUSE I DO AGREE A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NOT A LOT OF. MONEY IN THE AND WE LOOK AT THE ENTIRE STATE BUDGETS MAYBE SOME THE STATE CAN DO THAT- POSSIBLY REPAY LOAN OR SOMETHING TO HELP OUT BUT- STILL. THEY'VE GOT TO DO THEIR PART TO I MEAN. EMAIL TO ME SO MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S A POSSIBILITY MADAM CHAIR. AND I JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR THAT THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHO IS NOT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ITS ONE POINT. ONE POINT ONE MILLION. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER BROWN IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE CAN MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ISSUE. SEEN NONE WERE GONNA MOVE ON TO ACTUALLY OUR FINAL ISSUE OF THE DAY. THIS IS RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY. A SALES TAX EXCLUSION AS OUR FINAL ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN. WILL GO TO OUR PANELISTS MR SURE ENOUGH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- THIS IS DEREK SURE NOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY I BELIEVE HE- DEPARTMENT FINANCE WILL PRESENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. HI JACOB GRANDPARENT OF FINANCE SO THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY OPERATES A NUMBER OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO GREEN TECHNOLOGY FIRMS ONE OF THESE AS A SALES TAX EXEMPTION WHICH IS AWARDED THROUGH AN APPLICATION PROCESS AND IS INTENDED TO ASSIST MANUFACTURERS. IN PURCHASING CERTAIN EQUIPMENT FOR USE ALTERNATIVE SOURCE ENERGY PRODUCTION ADVANCED MANUFACTURING AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANUFACTURING THE PURPOSE OF THE SALES TAX EXEMPTION PROGRAM IS TO ENCOURAGE GREEN TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS TO TAKE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. SO OUR SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS ARE AWARDED TO APPLICANTS BASED ON A NET BENEFIT TEST WHICH IS OUTLINED IN THE PROGRAM'S REGULATIONS I MEAN IT'S COURSE PERSPECTIVE PROJECTS BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING THEIR ESTIMATED STATE AND LOCAL THAT'S GONNA FACT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT- AND ALSO THE EMPLOYMENT RATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE UP PROJECTS. PERSPECTIVE LOCATION SO THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY CAPPED AT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL EXEMPTIONS AVAILABLE TO BE AWARDED PER CALENDAR YEAR. AS CAP HAS BEEN REACHED EVERY YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN- AND THE PROGRAM IS ALREADY OVER SCRIPT OVERSUBSCRIBED FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALENDAR YEAR. SO THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME INCREASE TO THE CAP DOUBLING THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION THEN IF ANY AMOUNT OF THE EXTRA HUNDRED MILLION IS LEFT ON ALLOCATED IN THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE COULD BE ROLLED OVER AND AVAILABLE. FOR ALLOCATION IN TWENTY TWENTY TO- THIS. PROPOSALS RECORD OF THE NEED FOR FURTHER TAX RELIEF FOR BUSINESSES DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND DABNEY MINISTRATIONS RECOGNITION THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL MAGNIFICATION EFFECT ADDITIONAL AID FOR THESE INDUSTRIES MIGHT HAVE IN THE CURRENT MOMENT BUSINESSES ARE RECALIBRATING. I'M IN MAKING YOUR LONG TERM INVESTMENT PLANS PERHAPS RECONSIDERING. THEIR INVESTMENT LOCATION DECISIONS- EXACTLY TO MY COMMENTS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. I'M ALSO THIS DEREK HERE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY ANSWER SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATION. SIDE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PLEASE. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GRANULAR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE JUST HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS FIRST ON THE COST OF THE MEASURE WALL THE PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE THE ALLOCATION OF EXEMPTIONS BY A HUNDRED MILLION- WE WOULDN'T THAT THE ACTUAL FISCAL COSTS QUITE A BIT LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION FOR A COUPLE REASONS- ONE IS HISTORICALLY- ORTIZ AND NOT USED ALL OF THE EXEMPTION THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO THE- AND ALSO THAT. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP BETWEEN THIS PROGRAM AND ANOTHER- PROGRAM IN STATE LAW WHICH IS A PARTIAL EXEMPTION OF THE SALES TAX FOR A QUICK PURPOSES FOR MANUFACTURERS- AND FOR THOSE TWO REASONS THE ACTUAL COST OF THIS PROGRAM IS CLOSER TO THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. SPREAD OVER FIVE YEARS ONLY ABOUT SIX MILLION OF THAT IS ACTUAL GENERAL SPEED GENERAL FUND COSTS OF THE REMAINING- THIRTY TWO MILLION WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN LOCAL SALES TAX RETURNS. ARE ADDITIONALLY- IN GENERAL WE WOULD SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE AND PROVIDING BUSINESS ASSISTANCE AT THIS POINT IN THE STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY- THAT THE ASSISTANT SHOULD BE TARGETED AT BUSINESSES AND SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN- MOST IMPACTED BY THE CODEPENDENT MAKE AND ALSO THAT THAT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN A TIMELY MANNER- OVER CATTLE- WE DON'T FEEL THAT THIS PROGRAM. IS WELL TARGETED AT THE MOST IMPACT BUSINESSES AND ALSO THE BENEFITS WOULD OCCUR GRADUALLY OVER TIME I FOR THOSE REASONS AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE. WE'LL DISCRETION HOW TO ALLOCATE LOCAL SALES TAX DOLLARS AS OPPOSED TO REDIRECTING THEM FOR STATE PURPOSES- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER LUCKY. YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY% THAT THE COST OF NOT IMPLEMENTING THIS PROCESS. IS PRETTY HIGH BECAUSE WE HAVE INDUSTRIES REPRESENTED HERE THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS. THAT BRING IN A LOT OF INCOME TO THE STATE IN REVENUES THAT- DID MANAGE SEVERAL THESE INDUSTRIES COULD MOVE OUTSIDE OF STATE AND WE WOULD LOSE THE BENEFIT OF WHAT THEY FOR THIS. AND SO THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION SO I HIGHLY SUPPORT THIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BUT WILL A COLD MISTER MISTER LACKEYS CONCERNS AS WELL WE'LL BRING THIS ITEM UP AGAIN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FUTURE DISCUSSION ON ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO.
