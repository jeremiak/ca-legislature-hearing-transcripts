REGION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARITY [inaudible] THEY CAME. MEMBERS WERE GOING TO MOVE BACK TO THE SENATE THIRD READING FILE. ITEM NUMBER TWENTY SIX ON THE FILE SENATOR SKINNER. YOU'RE PREPARED. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FOUR BY SENATOR SKINNER AND ACT REALLY INTO CRIMINAL PROCEDURE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SB THREE NINETY FOUR CREATES THE OPTION OF A DIVERSION COURT. FOR PRIMARY CARE GIVERS OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN NOW. IN ORDER FOR THIS DIVERSION COURT FOR A DEFENDANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS DIVERSION COURT. THE PRESIDING JUDGE THE DA AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER ALL HAVE TO A DEGREE. I AGREE [inaudible] ADDITIONALLY DEFENDANTS CHARGED WITH SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES ARE EXCLUDED. FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCESS. THIS DIVERSION COURT IF. WE ARE IF IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT IS IN THE BILL. KNOW WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THREE NINETY FOUR ITS PURPOSE IS TO RECOGNIZE. THAT FAMILY SEPARATION HAS SIRIUS AND SOMETIMES PERMANENT IMPACTS. ON THE PARENT AND THE CHILD IMPACTED WE HEARD VERY VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONY IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE FROM A MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER. THE MOTHER ASHLEY WAS CHARGED IN PRIOR TO HER TRIAL. SHE TOOK HER THE FACT THAT SHE WAS IN THIS SERIOUS SITUATION QUITE SERIOUSLY AT THE POINT OF HER. BEING CHARGED SHE HAD. A CHILD WHO WAS A TODDLER. IN PRIOR TO THE TRIAL. SHE SECURED EMPLOYMENT. SHE ATTENDED VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN PARENTING CLASSES AND SHE DEMONSTRABLY TURNED HER LIFE AROUND BY THE TIME OF HER TRIAL. THERE WERE POLICE OFFICERS COMMUNITY LEADERS AND MANY OTHERS WHO TESTIFIED TO HER CHARACTER INTO THE CLEAR DEPARTURE FROM THE BEHAVIOR THAT SHE HAD EXHIBITED. THAT LED TO THE CHARGE. BUT GIVEN THAT THERE WERE NO DIVERSION COURT OPTIONS. SHE WAS SENTENCED AND SERVED THREE YEARS AT THE POINT THAT SHE STARTED HER INCARCERATION. HER DAUGHTER WAS THREE YEARS OLD. AT THE POINT THAT SHE WAS REUNITED WITH HER FAMILY AND HER DAUGHTER. THE DAUGHTER DIDN'T REALLY EVEN KNOW HER NOR DID ACTUALLY KNOW HER CHILD. AND THEY HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT DETACHMENT SINCE THAT TIME IN HER DAUGHTER ASIA TESTIFIED TO COMMITTEE. IT WAS VERY VERY POWERFUL NOW CLEARLY SUCH A DIVERSION COURT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ALL DEFENDANTS AND THAT IS WHY THE BILL IS DESIGNED NUMBER ONE TO EXCLUDE THOSE WITH SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES. AND ADDITIONALLY TO REQUIRE THE PRESIDING JUDGE THE DA AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER TO ALL AGREE BEFORE THAT DEFENDANT CAN HAVE THAT OPTION FOR DIVERSION COURT. AND WITH THAT I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT SB. THREE NINETY FOUR IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR GROVE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. ARE YOU PREPARED TO ACCEPT QUESTION YES. SO I A CAN ADDRESS IT IN YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU LIKE BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THERE'S NO DEBATE ON THE FLOOR BUT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS I'D LIKE CLARIFIED -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS -- PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER THE VETERANS COURT THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL I NEED TO KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT. AND IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE PROBE -- THE PUBLIC DEFENDER AND THE JUDGE HAVE I DON'T SEE VETO POWER BUT THEY HAVE SOME THEY CAN OBJECT TO SOMEONE. GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS IF THEY FEEL THAT THIS PERSON IS A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY OR IF THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S FILL THAT -- THIS THE PERSON THAT IS IN QUESTION DOES NOT MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PROGRAM. AND NUMBER THREE AND I HATE THAT THERE'S THREE BUT IT IS. IF THEY GO THROUGH THIS DIVERSION PROGRAM AND THEY DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY STAY ON THE PROGRAM COMPLETE ALL THE CLASSES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE THEM. OF OF A BETTER MEMBER OF SOCIETY LIKE JOBS AND YOU KNOW THINGS THAT ARE IN THE PROGRAM FOR DIVERSION. IF IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IS CAN THEY GO BACK TO TRIAL OR IS IT DISMISSED YEAH I NEED TO KNOW IF IT'S DISMISSED WITH OR WITHOUT PREJUDICE. SO IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I REALLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU. VERY GOOD IS THERE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SAYING NINE FIVE CENTER SKINNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU -- FOR ARE. MINORITY LEADER SCHOOL QUESTIONS WHICH I WILL ADDRESS IN THIS CLOSE SO AS I INDICATED IN MY OPENING. THIS DIVERSION COURT IF WE WERE TO ESTABLISH IT. WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO A DEFENDANT ON LESS. ALL. THREE THE JUDGE. THE DA. AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER AGREE AND THEY HAVE TO AGREE IN WRITING. THAT'S EXPLICIT IN THE BILL AND THE PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL VETERANS DIVERSION COURT WHICH WE RECOGNIZED IN ESTABLISHING IT WE RECOGNIZED THAT OUR VETERANS. COME BACK [inaudible] AND THEY'VE SUFFERED GREAT TRAUMA FROM THEIR EXPERIENCES IN OUR IN THEIR SERVICE ON OUR BEHALF. AND WE NOT ONLY HAVE THEY SUFFERED THIS DRAMA THEY'VE ALSO UNFORTUNATELY ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS. THERE THE SERVICES THAT ARE VETERANS DEPARTMENT WOULD OFFER THEM. SO NOW DOES THAT JUSTIFY ANY TYPE OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR NO BUT IT CERTAINLY WE WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT CAN LEAD A PERSON TO BEHAVIORS THAT. WE DON'T FIND ACCEPTABLE BUT THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO FACTOR THOSE THINGS. BEFORE WE SENTENCE THEM AARON TO INCARCERATE THEM AND SO THAT'S WHY WE ESTABLISH THE VETERANS COURT. AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT IS WORKING VERY VERY WELL. AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN A TERRIBLE UPTICK IN THOSE VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DIVERSIONARY COURT. IN THERE ARE. FIVE ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN THIS OPTION AND HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TYPE ACOSTA THE AVAILABLE TO THEM -- AND CERTAINLY THESE DO YOU. THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THAT IN A DIVERSION COURT IT IS THE THE ENTITIES THAT ARE PART OF THAT pSUCH THATDETERMINE THEN WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS IF THE PERSON IS NOT INCARCERATED. SO DOES INCLUDE ELECTRONIC MONITORING IS IT SUCH IS THE WHAT OTHER TYPES OF SUPERVISION IS THE PERSON PUT IN IN ORDER TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. AND SO WE'VE SEEN IT WORKED VERY WELL IN THE VETERANS DIVERSIONARY COURT IN SO YES THIS IS PATTERNED AFTER THAT. NOW TO THE QUESTION OF IF THE PERSON. IS BREAKS ANY OF THE IF YOU KNOW IF THEY VIOLATE ANY OF THE TERMS OF THE SUPERVISION. THEN YES THEY WOULD BE BROUGHT BACK THAT IS ALSO PART OF THE BILL IT IT THEY WOULDN'T THERE THIS IS NOT A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD. SO I HOPE THAT I ADDRESSED THE CONCERNS THAT ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT HAVE. AND THIS IS THE SERIOUS FELONIES. SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONY SUCH AS MURDER AND RAPE AND OF COURSE MANY OTHERS AND I DON'T MEAN ONLY TO BRING UP THOSE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE OTHER SERIOUS -- IN VIOLENT FELONIES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DEFENDANT BEING ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM. SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE IF THERE IS A CLEAR PATH. FOR A PERSONAGE DEMONSTRATED THEIR REHABILITATIVE. POTENTIAL AND WE CAN KEEP A FAMILY FROM BEING SEPARATED AND THUS A CHILD FROM GOING INTO FOSTER CARE FOR EXAMPLE. THIS IS ONE OPTION THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO PURSUE AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB. THREE NINETY FOUR THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. HI ARCHULETA.

SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR REQUIRE AN ACCOLADE ELECTIONS A DECLINE THEIR THROATS TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. CENTER MCGUIRE HEY GOOD MORNING MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH -- HONORED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S TE PRESIDENTIAL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. MEMBERS I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT TRANSPARENCY IS A NON PARTISAN ISSUE IN ITS THAT TRANSPARENCY THAT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT. FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS MEMBERS EVERY U. S. PRESIDENT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE HAVE RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. THESE PATRIOTS HAVE PUT THEIR NATION'S INTERESTS ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE PRESIDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE TO PUT THEIR OWN INTERESTS DECIDE WHETHER IT BE BUSINESS TIES OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF OUR NATION AND THAT GREATER GOOD IS AMERICAN SECURITY IN THE PROTECTION OF ITS PEOPLE. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES PROVIDE VOTERS WITH ESSENTIAL INFORMATION. ON REGARDING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DEALINGS FINANCIAL STATUS IS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS. AND WHILE THE RELEASING OF TAX RETURNS HAS SPARKED INTENSE CONVERSATION AND DEBATE OVER THE PAST MANY DECADES ALL CANDIDATES ALL CANDIDATES HAVE PUT THE DISCOMFORT ASIDE FOR THE PAST FOUR DECADES BECAUSE THE RELEASING OF TAX RETURNS. HAS BECOME A TIME HONORED TRADITION IN OUR DEMOCRACY NOW. I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THIS. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A STRONG EXAMPLE THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY. ONE THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS NOT ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC PERSON OR POLITICAL PARTY IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN ACT. AND I WOULD BE HERE SPEAKING ON THIS FLOOR TODAY IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD NOT RELEASED HER TAX RETURNS. STATES HAVE AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN PROVIDING CHECKS AND BALANCES TO FEDERAL POLICY IN FACT BY THE POWER OF THE US CONSTITUTION STATES HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE. THAT THE BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS VOTERS NOT ONLY DESERVE FULL DISCLOSURE OF THEIR FUTURE LEADERS TAX RETURNS THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED. AND THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP BRING THAT TRANSPARENCY BACK. SB ONE FORTY NINE IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE IN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM [inaudible] SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT WANTED TO BE A JOINT AUTHORED THIS BILL INTO A PARTNERED WITH -- THE SENATOR FROM HEALDSBURG ON AND I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP -- THIS IS BASIC TRANSPARENCY HAVING A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ALREADY LEGALLY REQUIRED FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. TO DISCLOSE THEIR TAX RETURNS BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A ROUTINE THING AND EVERYONE DID IT -- AND PEOPLE REALLY SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT IT'S NOT REQUIRED AND WE NEED TO MAKE A REQUIRED AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE SENATOR BURGESS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WASN'T PLANNING ON SPEAKING ON THIS MATTER -- THE IT HAD GONE TO JUDICIARY AND I WANT TO COMMEND -- THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL FOR BEING A MAN OF HIS WORD AND CONTINUING -- TO TO HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT BEGAN IN JUDICIARY -- I HAD EXPRESSED US OPPOSITION AT THAT POINT -- PRIMARILY BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD TREAT OUR FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR REGION WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL OFFICERS. ARE THE SAME AS OUR STATE OFFICERS AND VICE VERSA SO I THINK FOR CREDIBILITY PURPOSES IT WOULD BE HELPFUL THAT IF ANYTHING LIKE THIS WERE TO GO FORWARD. THAT THERE BE AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD I DON'T THINK THIS SCRUTINY SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER -- UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES SO AS A MATTER POLICY -- I HAD PRESENTED THAT JUDICIARY -- AND I I THINK -- WILL BE HEARING ABOUT THIS IN THE IN THE FUTURE I WILL -- RESPECTFULLY. DECLINE -- TO SUPPORT THIS AT THIS POINT BUT THOSE ARE MY SENTIMENTS THANK YOU CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS -- NONPARTISAN STATEMENT THAT HE WOULD BE SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL REGARDLESS OF THE NOMINEE EVEN IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD NOT SHARED HER -- TAX RETURNS I WOULD ALSO BE SPEAKING OPPOSITION. TO THIS BILL -- REGARDLESS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE ORTHEIR DESIRE TO RELEASE ARE NOT RELEASE THEIR TAX RETURNS. I HAD INITIALLY OFFERED AMENDMENTS -- DRAFTED -- TO TO EXPAND THIS MAJOR TO ALL CANDIDATES FOR FEDERAL OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WOULD BE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR U. S. HOUSE SEATS AND OUR TWO U. S. SENATE SEATS. MY THOUGHT WAS THE AS IN YOUR BOARD JUST MENTION THAT WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS ALSO GOOD FOR THE GANDER. AFTER ALL THE SECOND IN LINE OF SUCCESSION TO THE PRESIDENT. IS CURRENTLY THE HOUSE A HOUSE MEMBER FROM CALIFORNIA SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI. AND THE THIRD IN LINE OF SUCCESSION TO TO THE HOUSE THAT U. S. SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM. WALL CURRENTLY THAT OFFICES HELP AND I'M CERTAINLY BACK UP. THIRD IN LINE OF SUCCESSION IS THAT HOW YOU S. SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM. AND WHILE THAT CURRENTLY THAT OFFICE IS CURRENTLY HELD BY A SENATOR FROM IOWA. IT S POSSIBLE ONE DAY THAT IT COULD BE HELD FROM A SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA. ANYWAY LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL OPINED THAT MY MEMBERS JUST BE TWENTY SEVEN WOULD MOST LIKELY VIOLATE THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. SO I'M NOT GOING TO OFFER THOSE AMENDMENTS TODAY HAS I DON'T WANT TO WASTE ANY OF OUR TIME. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ALSO OPINED THAT SB TWENTY SEVEN ITSELF. VIOLATES THE US CONSTITUTION. FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN IS BEACH HAS VETOED THE PREDECESSOR TO SB TWENTY SEVEN LAST SESSION EVEN SAID THAT THE BILL PROBABLY WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. I GET THAT PLAYING THE RESISTANCE CARD MAY BE GOOD POLITICS FOR THE MAJORITY PARTY. BUT I WOULD SUBMIT THAT IT'S BAD POLICY FOR CALIFORNIANS. THE MAJORITY PARTY SOLVES ALL THE REAL PROBLEMS FACING OUR% STATE SUCH AS A HIGH GASOLINE TAX COSTS. LACK OF HOUSING RAMPANT HOMELESSNESS GRIDLOCK TRAFFIC HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. GAINES INVIOLATE CRIME THEN I'D RECOMMEND STOP PLAYING POLITICS AND LET'S START GOVERNING. I I RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON THIS MAJOR THANK YOU. SENATOR BREAUX. THANK YOU MEMBERS -- COUPLE OF HIS THOUGHTS THAT I HAD -- I I THINK MAYBE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN AUDIT OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS IN A ROW. AND HAS BEEN FOUND -- HIS TAXES ARE CLEAN BUT BUT THAT'S NOT THE DISCUSSION WHERE I WANT TO GO I THINK ABOUT IF THIS COMES DOWN TO US ON THE FLOOR I'VE SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE WHO OWN RENTAL PROPERTIES RIGHT. IN ON YUR SCHEDULE II IT HAS YOU KNOW YOUR ADDRESS HERE RENTAL PROPERTIES RIGHT SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE SOMEBODY. THAT WANTS TO HARM YOU -- THEY COULD GO TO YOUR RENTAL PROPERTY AND HARM YOUR TENANTS FOR AN EXAMPLE MILLER'S THAT'S PERSONAL INFORMATION IT'S GONNA INFECT YOUR TENANTS AND OTHER THINGS. AS WELL AS EVEN WHAT YOUR INVESTMENTS ARE EVEN MAYBE COMPANIES IT YOUR OWN SELF HABITAT -- PERSONAL AND PRIVATE INFORMATION -- FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS OUT THERE FOR EVERYBODY SEE I THINK -- COULD CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR FOR ALL OF US HERE IF WE END UP BY -- YOU KNOW HOW HOW DOES THE SAYING GO OPPORTUNITY ERA. OPPORTUNITY FOR í FAVORITISM TOWARDS NINE SO IF YOU BELIEVE IN AT THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD EXTEND OUT TO EVERYONE HERE TOO SO I WILL BE A NO VOTE ON IT BECAUSE I THINK -- IT'S NOT GREAT POLICY BUT I LOVE THE AUTHOR [inaudible] SENATOR ALAN. AND THE QUESTION TO THE OTHER. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ACCEPT QUESTION ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MAY PROCEED SENATE WE WERE JUST TALKING HERE ABOUT -- THE ISSUE OF CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AND BECAUSE THAT THAT COULD THAT COULD BE BE A PRETTY INVASIVE POTENTIALLY. WHEN WE ARE IN COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH RIGHT TO THE GOOD CENTER -- WE'RE COMMITTEE WE ACTUALLY SHOWED TO REDACTED VERSIONS ONE FROM A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH AND ONE FROM A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. I IN SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS REDACTED. REDACTED BY THE FEDS -- AND THEN PUT ONLINE -- AND WE WERE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE BOTH -- PROFITABLE A ON NONPROFIT CONTRIBUTIONS. WHERE I'M NOT SURE WHY A NON PROFIT -- CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE CONTROVERSIAL -- AND IN FACT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT EVERY US PRESIDENT SINCE JIMMY CARTER. EVERYONE OF THEM. AND IN EVERY MAJOR PARTY. CANDIDATE FOR US PRESIDENT SINCE JIMMY CARTER HAVE RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS IT'S GONE INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. IN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN THE PRESS AND HADN'T ABILITY TO BE ABLE. TO REVIEW THE FITNESS OF THAT PRESIDENT NOW. THE CURRENT PRESIDENT IS NOW IN THE WORLD'S LONGEST AUDIT FROM THE IRS I GET IT. I AIN'T -- EIGHT DISCLOSES VITAL INFORMATION ON WHAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS. AND IT THAT ALSO INCLUDES CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. I I GUESS MY QUESTION WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAY THE REDACTED BY THE FEDS WHO'S DOING THE REDACTING AND AND WHAT'S THE FORCE OF LAW FOR THAT WITH RELATION TO THIS BILL. TO THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE IS A AS STATED IN THE BILL WOULD ACTUALLY DO THE REDACTING. FIVE YEARS OF TAX. RETURNS WOULD BE COLLECTED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE THE SECTOR IS STATES OFFICE WOULD ACTUALLY DO THE REDACTING THIS INCIDENT PERMISSION SO FOR EXAMPLE SOCIAL. NUMBERS PERSONAL ADDRESSES HOME PHONE NUMBERS -- BUT AGAIN I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE PAST FORTY YEARS. THERE IS NOT BEEN A PRESIDENT. REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. WHO'S BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT HAS NOT RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS IT HAS NOT HARM THEM. HAS IT STARTED DEBATE IN THIS NATION ABSOLUTELY BUT THAT DEBATE IS HEALTHY FOCUSING ON POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOREIGN INVESTMENTS RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. BUSINESS INTERESTS I'M A AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND THE PRESS DESERVED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE IMPORTANT ITEMS. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MADAM AT PRESIDENT I DO APPRECIATE THE OTHER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD HOWEVER I THINK IT IS A COMPLETE AND ABSOLUTE VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION ARTICLE. ONE AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THERE HAS BEEN THIS RESISTANCE MOVING FORWARD CONTINUOUSLY. BUT WE AS A BODY IN THIS STATE NEED THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THINGS AND IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD GET THE POLICY ISSUES TO BE ABLE. TO GARNER THE THINGS THAT WE NEED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN A CONGENIAL WAY INSTEAD OF JUST THE CONSTANT BARRAGE AN ATTACK THIS IS A VIOLATION OF OUR CONSTITUTION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS INSTRUMENTAL IN YOU KNOW -- THE FIRES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE VALLEY THE DAMS THAT ARE BROKEN WE DO HAVE OUR I NEED TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL AT THE ADMINISTRATION. AND SO. ASIDE FROM ALL OF THAT THE BILL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VIOLATES ARTICLE ONE OF THE CONSTITUTION AND IT. REQUIRES THINGS THAT ARE NOT ACTUALLY APPROPRIATED SO I WOULD JUST APPRECIATE A NO VOTE SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT QUESTION THE AUTHOR. WE ACCEPT THE QUESTION IT'S BEEN A PRESENT THANK YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU HAVE HEARD A NUMBER OF MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR THE ME THAT THEY DETERMINE THAT THE BILL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL I WONDERED IF YOU HAD -- LET'S COUNCIL OPINION ON WHETHER OR NOT IT'S CONS THE HAS BEEN IT'S THEIR OPINION WHETHER OR NOT IT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS CONSTITUTIONAL ANNA THANK YOU SO MUCH. TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES WE'VE HAD SEVERAL OPINIONS -- THAT HAVE WEIGHED IN ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS BILL. THAT I COULD TALK ABOUT THREE OKAY. LEDGE COUNCIL LEDGE COUNCIL HAS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE CAN'T CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE BILL. THE END THE CHIEF ETHICS COUNCILS FOR BOTH GEORGE W. BUSH. AS WELL AS BROCK OBAMA THEY HAVE REVIEWED THE BILL. AND THEY DECLARE THAT THEY BELIEVE IT STANDS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY TEST. AND LOOK THE BOTTOM LINE IS IS WE CAN ALL TALK WE CAN ALL DEBATE ON THE FLOOR ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS BILL. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE A LOOK TO WHAT MAKES OUR DEMOCRACY STRONG. THE FOUNDATION OF ANY SUCCESSFUL GOVERNMENT IS TRANSPARENCY. TRANSPARENCY. IN ANDIDLY. OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS PATRIOTS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS OF LIKE IT'S STEPPED UP TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE THEIR TAX RETURNS THE RELEASE THEIR TAX RETURNS BECAUSE IT'S A TIME HONORED TRADITION. IN OUR NATION'S DEMOCRACY. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL REGARDLESS IF YOU'RE REPUBLICAN REGARDLESS IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT. THIS WILL HELP MAKE OUR DEMOCRACY STRONGER -- A AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL ALSO BE TESTED IN THE COURTS AND RIGHTFULLY SO. BUT TO BE ABLE TO ALSO TO ADDRESS THE SENATORS -- QUESTION ON BALLOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY PORTION THAT PEOPLE MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT. STATES HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT SIGNATURE GATHERING. THEY HAD TO BE AT A SET REQUIREMENTS IS THAT REQUIREMENTS ON FILING FEES THE MIDDLE DEADLINES ESSENTIALLY THE CONSTITUTIONALITY IS FOCUS ON IF EVERYONE CAN MEET THE DEMAND OF THE STATE. THIS IS GOING TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT CAN MEET THE DEMAND TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE THEIR TAX RETURNS. AND IT'S VERY CLEAR WITHIN THIS BILL IF YOU DO NOT FILE TAX RETURNS. YOUR NAME WOULD ALSO SHOW ON THE BALLOT. SO THIS IS NOT PROHIBITED OF ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL OR DIRECTED TO ONE IN ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL AND THAT IS WHAT THE COURTS ARE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL RIGHT CENTER MCGUIRE CAN I ACCEPT THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY ONE LAST ITEM MEN AND PRESIDENT -- IN THAT IS A TO THE GOOD FOR IT SENATOR FROM FRESNO -- I GAVE HIM MY WORD THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON POTENTIAL RELEASING OF TAX RETURNS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS IN THE STATE -- I AM NOT PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON THAT BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THAT TRYING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEED OF THE GOOD SENATOR FROM FRESNO. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS IN ON THAT AND HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME HEADWAY HERE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND ALL THIS -- INDY HERE WITH THIS. THERE ARE VERY FEW TIMES. WHERE YOU HAVE THE ETHICS ATTORNEYS FOR BOTH GEORGE W. BUSH? AS WELL AS BARACK OBAMA AGREE. AND THEY HAVE ALL AGREED THEY BOTH AGREED. THAT THIS WILL WITHSTAND THE CONSTITUTIONALITY TAX. IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPARENCY WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER SECRETARY THE ROLE ALLEN [inaudible] ARCHULETA [inaudible] HI ATKINS. I BATES. NO BILL. HI WE'RE JUST.
