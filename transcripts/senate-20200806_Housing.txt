AND LIKE A BETTER COME COMING. THINK HEARING. MR TO ON THE COMMITTEE LET ME JUST SAY THAT I AM REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S. WORK IN THIS AREA HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB- MOVING THE WHOLE ISSUE OF EIGHTY USE THAT NOW TO HELP. FINANCING IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- COMMITTEE. RAISED SOME CONCERNS AND I APOLOGIZE TO- CENTER SKINNER- I IN REGARDS TO THESE BUT- YOU'RE NOT THE AUTHOR BUT YOU'RE- DOING THE PRESENTATION SO ON MY CONCERNS HAVE TO DO WITH A NUMBER OF THE ITEMS THAT WERE LISTED. ONE I'M CONCERNED THAT- THAT THIS PROGRAM WORKS AND IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES AND IN PARTICULAR IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THERE'S A THERE'S A TREMENDOUS NEED PROBLEM AND THEN THERE WAS A RECOMMENDATION THAT. HE APA L. AND- THAT DAD. IF THAT'S THE CASE IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO COME UP WITH THE RULES IT'LL GOVERNESS- AND THE REASON THAT THE A. P. BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT IS THERE SOME COMMUNITIES. FROM THAT HAVE PRINT CIRCUMSTANCE AND ARE GONNA NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN HOW THIS GETS CREATED AND IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A VIBRANT PUBLIC OUTREACH PROCESS- YOU DON'T GET THE- THE INPUT AND THEN THE NEED. VERY COMMUNITIES AN IMPORTANT MANY OF MY- SO BE THEME FOR TODAY IS THAT I HAVE A TWENTY SEVEN CITIES AND- FOR THOSE CITIES ARE LARGER THAN FORTY THOUSAND THE REST ARE WAY BELOW I HAVE A COUPLE THAT ARE FIFTEEN HUNDRED RESIDENTS AND SO WHAT WORKS IN A BIG CITY DOESN'T NECESSARILY. IN THOSE DAYS BUT THE GREAT HOUSING. IS PARTICULAR AFFORDABLE. THOSE ARE I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT HE'S TRYING TO DOING THIS BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THOSE ARE KIND OF IMPORTANT TO ME AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH. TENER SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND YES MAY I. SO I AM A- AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. IT IS AN AB BUT I AM A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR. END OF. WORKING THE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND CAL HFA ON IT IN SO.I GUESS WHAT I WOULD RESPOND IS THAT. THE LAWS THAT HAVE. HELPED ENCOURAGE AND MAKE IT EASIER TO BILL EIGHTY USE. HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR STATEWIDE. AND THEY ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO. FOR DO NOT DISCRIMINATE THE BASS PLAYER ENCOURAGE. FOR EVERYONE WHAT THIS. IS A FINANCING BILL. ANY CAN THIS FINANCING TO. AS I UNDERSTAND IT. WOULD NOT BE IN THE I SAY AS I UNDERSTAND IT. BETTER. CAN SORRY. WOULD BE ONE THAT AGAIN IS NOT IS AVAILABLE TO ANY HOW AND REASON IT'S NECESSARY IS BECAUSE THERE ARE HOMEOWNERS ESPECIALLY UNFORTUNATELY LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE A GREAT ASSET OF THEIR HOME WITH GREAT EQUITY BUT THEY MAY NOT HAVE GREAT CREDIT. AND BECAUSE OF THEIR NON HAVING GREAT CREDIT THE USUAL FINANCING TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM- BUT BECAUSE THE IMPROVEMENT IS THE IMPROVEMENT TO THE HOME IMPROVEMENT IS WILL HAVE LITTLE INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE HOME SO WE'RE TRYING TO. GET OUR TOP BILLS BY FINANCING TOOL FOR EXACTLY THAT COMMUNITIES THAT MOST NEED SO I THINK THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU'RE EXPRESSING WOULD BE ADDRESSED. THIS IS WHAT I DID NOT MENTION IN MY OPENING IS AT. ALL THE TREASURES OFFICE IS PLAYING A ROLE WOULD BE DONE IN YOUR SHIP WITH H. C. D. AND CAL J. AND US BEFORE OFTEN. OKAY CLOSE DRAWS FIRST PUBLISHED. US CORRECTLY RELATED TO THE S. I WAS I'M ALL CO AUTHOR ON THIS IN PART OF THE IT MAY PROCEDURE FOR THAT THE REACHED THE POINT. THIS IS THE PRESSURES REPRESENTATIVE NOTED THIS IS A DERIVATIVE OF EXISTING LOAN PROGRAMS SO FOR THE- AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT IT'S CAPTURED IN THE PROGRAMS ARE GOING WE'RE NOT WE'RE CREATING THESE BRIDGE PLANS THE PRIVATE LENDERS ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES WHO ARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO GIVE GIVE THEM UP. I THINK THE MONEY PEOPLE HAVE WHAT WOULD EITHER HAVE INCOME THEY'RE NOT GONNA USE THIS PROGRAM HAZARDOUS GOING TO GO OUT AND PAY FOR THE EIGHTY YOU ARE GO TO WELLS FARGO AND GET IT IT'S GOING TO BE THAT SECOND TIER BY DEFINITION ARE THE ONES THAT. ARE GETTING THOSE LOANS AND DATE ON PAPER DON'T QUALIFY THROUGH THE PRIVATE LNDER STILL HAVE TO QUALIFY THEM BUT WE'RE GOING TO. GIVE THAT GUARANTEE SO THAT THEY CAN DROP A LOAN AND NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE PEOPLE COULD YOU STILL GET THE UNIT YOU'RE SOMEBODY'S GOT THAT OUT AT THE END OF THE- SO. IT TURNED OUT. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE THE PRO. AND A- WITH THE- PART OF THE SCHEME PRO TO GET. THIS OUT TO GET WITHIN WE CAN OUT FOLKS HIS. THROUGH THE OWNERS IN. HEALTH URBAN OR SUBURBAN CAL SO I THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THANK RIGHT NOW WE'RE OPEN TO. CONSIDERATIONS THANK YOU CENTER BECAUSE THE CENTER THERE ALSO AND THANK YOU FOR YIELDING TO CENTER BY CAL SKI TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER. WELCOME SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WHAT KIND OF FEEDBACK BASED ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE. HAS CAL HFA PROVIDED WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN THEIR FEEDBACK OR THEIR- RECOMMENDATIONS OR IDEAS. FIVE THREE CHAIR. BUT THE VENTURE FIRM KELLY AFFAIRS BEEN INVOLVED IN ALL OF THE DISCUSSIONS AND- CAL HFA HAS HAD A PILOT PROJECT RIGHT NOW BUT IN A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY AND- ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS THEY DID NOT SEE THE TAKE UP THAT THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE EXPECTING. I THINK YOU LOOK THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY PILOT WAS IT WAS NOT A COMMUNITY THAT HAD A HIGH HOUSING NEED AND IT WAS NOT IN A HIGH JOB EITHER AND SO IT WASN'T COMPLETELY SURPRISING THAT IT DIDN'T QUITE HAVE THE TAKE UP THAT PEOPLE HAVE EXPECTED- BUT WHAT THIS FIVE. WHAT IN WORKS CAL HFA IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE WHAT WE ARE ON WORKING ON DESIGNING IS TO HAVE. A CAL HFA HAS HAD HAVE SOME OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCE ENTITIES IN PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK WITH. WELL STATE MAY PLAY A ROLE. IN I'M IN HELPING CREATE A- BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR LENDER WE WOULD STILL BE REAL% ON SECTOR LENDERS AND SCALIGER OBVIOUSLY IT HAS THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE YES WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM. I'M SORRY MR CHAIRMAN RIGHT I HAVE TO I DIDN'T. ASK THAT THE YOU FOR PERMISSION FOR THE QUESTION SO I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION ABSOLUTELY SIR OKAY THANK YOU- THE OTHER IS- ISSUES WERE RAISED ABOUT ISSUING THE BONDS. ON AND- I THINK I KNOW BASIC ANSWER BUT IF YOU HAVE MORE INSIGHT IS- HOW. WOULD YOU RATE HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL BERRY IS WITH REGARDS TO THE BONDS OF THIS PROGRAM. THE TIME THAT IT TAKES AN. I'M THE MISTER WACO SKI DO YOU HAVE A BETTER ANSWER ON THE BONTA PORTION OF IT THERE. RIGHT THROUGH THE CHAIRS CENTER ONE HEALTHY YES- MISTER CHAIR PHIL SAID THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT ALREADY ISSUES REVENUES BONDS ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ISSUES ONE OF ONE OF THE OTHER COMPANION BILLS. COMPANION BILLS THAT WE HAVE HERE IS THOSE TAX CREDITS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE OUR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TAKE A- ADVANTAGE OF WHERE THE PEOPLE CAN'T PAY RENT THE LANDLORD COULD GET A TAX CREDIT. THAT'S GOING TO CREATE A FUND A POTENTIAL FUND OF MONEY WHAT WHAT THE BILLS DECIDED TO IS EXPAND THAT. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE USE OF FUNDS. TO THE EIGHTY YOU LET SO IT'S AUGMENTATION OF THE EXISTING FUNDS OR THEIR A PLUS THIS INCREMENTAL IT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE SIZE OF THE PIE AND- AGAIN. I THINK IT IS THE PRESENTER SAID THIS IS IT'S SIMPLY A BRIDGE LOAN SO WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW IF I IF I IF I. IT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO'S QUALIFIED IS GOING TO COME IN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS THE WE'RE GOING TO GUARANTEE THAT THIS. MUST HELPFUL GUARANTEED GOING TO BE THIS MONEY THIS COULD COME IN BUT THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO A BANK AFTER THE EIGHTEENTH KANNST. AND GET THE PHONE BACK ALL THE FEE TO THE STATE- JUST. THINGS SOURCES OF. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU CENTER THE AUTHORS MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I IT GET A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I CALL STYLE DRIFT WERE. EVERMAN STARTS TODAY HE SAID IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN ITS CORE BUSINESS- AND SOLD FOR JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING WILL WILL MAKE SENSE- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A FOUNDATION THEY WERE NOT A MORTGAGE COMPANY. AND WE ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN HAVE A LOW WAGE WORKFORCE WE HAVE PRETTY EXPENSIVE BENEFITS SO IT GETS REAL INTERESTING WHEN YOU WANT TO DO. SOME PASTA ASSIST TO SEE HOW THIS PENCILS OUT SO I. A THEM CURIOUS IF I COULD ASK MISTER TIM SCHAFER A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF HE'S STILL ON THE LINE. AND HERE SENATOR THANK YOU YES SO YOU MADE BY CENTER MORE LIKE WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION YOU MAY ANSWER THANK YOU MISTER WILL DISCLOSE THAT MR SCHAEFER IS A FORMER ORANGE COUNTY. AND A FRIEND SO. WITH THAT MISTER SCHAEFFER NOTED- BORROWERS ARE GOING TO GO LOOK AT THIS PROGRAM- PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO EQUITY IN THEIR PROPERTY OR- JONES. YOU KNOW HAVE THE MAYBE THE CREDIT RATING SCORE THAT WOULD BE- IN KERR JIM- SO MY CONCERN IS A DEFAULT RATE IT WOULD BE AWKWARD FOR THIS HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN FORECLOSURE AND SO YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING SOME WORK WITH. ORIGINATING LENDERS BUT BUT HOW HOW ARE WE ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP. AND MAINTAIN A VERY LOW. THANK YOU SENATOR OUT OF AND ATTACK THAT BY THE FIRST OF LANCASTER TRYING A LITTLE BIT AGREE WE INCREASE THE HOLD ON ONE SECOND COOLEY INCREASE THE AUDIO OR COULD YOU OR YOU SPEAK. SIX IS THAT BETTER SNOW YOU'RE VERY YOU'RE VERY FAINT AND SO I DON'T KNOW YEAH A- I HAVE HOW IS THIS ANY BETTER THAT'S MUCH BETTER. OKAY THANK YOU. SENATOR MARCO RIGHT INTO YOUR QUESTION THIS WAY AT THE END AGREED. TO WHAT MORE WERE TEMPORARY BYZANTINE AWKWARD STRUCTURE FREQUENTLY THEY WERE WEBER COLD CHANGE MARKET MARRIES HOME WOULD BORROW MONEY FOR FIVE OR TEN YEARS AND THEN WOULD HAVE SOME BRIEF AND PRESS. AND THAT'S WHAT THE THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGE BECAME MORE COMMON. ZELTER THAT STANDARD. LARA'S SINGLE FAMILY FOR MUCH MORE EASILY FROM. UNDERWRITING CRITERIA TO YOUR POINT ABOUT CREDIT WORTHINESS AND EQUITY COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE UNDERWRITING CRITERIA. IN THIS WHAT. THREE STARTED TO BECOME MORE THAT BECAME MORE DIFFICULT AGAIN THE THEY CHOOSE. TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. BE CONTEMPLATED FRAME FOR THE WOULD. WOULDN'T UNDERMINE STANDARDIZED UNDER CRY ANOTHER WAY. A PROPERTY IN ORDER TO CALL. EXCESS THREE TWO UNIT WOULD STILL HAVE TO MEET UNDERWRITING. OF THE UNDER. NOW THE PROBLEM IS. THAT IT'S A TIME PROBLEM THE IS THAT IF I'M BILL AND DWELLING UNIT IN MY HOME. IT ISN'T YEAH. AND SINCE IT'S NOT RENTED. THE UNDERWRITING CRITERIA TIPO YOU TO MARK WON'T. RATIOS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO THE PERIOD IN OTHER WORDS TO ENCOURAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU'RE KIDDING NORMAL UNDERWRITING CRITERIA. FOR ATTACK- DO YOU RATE THE HOMEOWNER TO. BE INCOME FROM THE RENTAL ANY COUNT EQUITY UNDER THAT INTERIM PERIOD TO PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR THAT MUCH AS THE FEDERAL HOUSING IT. IT FOR AFTER THE BREAK TO AND WHICH HAD HELD TO THE STANDARD OF THE THIRTY OR MORE AS WE KNOW IT AND THAT PERHAPS IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE SELECTED. FOR A WERE. CAN TO BE IN A VERY LOW RATE MARKET PLACE AND IT SAYS THAT THE STATE WILL CHARGE PREMIUMS FEET THEN AND SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. RISK FALLS SO PROGRAMS. SO I'M WONDERING IF YOUR LENDING COSTS WOULD BE HIGHER THAN WHAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. MR SHAPE FOR YOU MAN SO THE QUESTION. THANK YOU MR CERTAINLY SENATOR I CAN'T PREDICT THAT KIND OF FUTURE I WILL TELL YOU THAT IF THE PROGRAM IS MORE THREE AND THE TREASURY BELIEVES IT IS WORTH THREE I MEAN THAT THE FIRM. IS IN THE MARKET WILL WE HOPE TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED AND BASS PRO IF WE THE PROGRAM OPERATED BY. G. AS Y.

OKAY THAT CONCLUDES OPPOSITION TESTIMONY- WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS REGARDING AB. TWENTY THREE FORTY CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M I'M A STRUGGLE THIS ONE LET ME JUST SAY THAT I'VE SUPPORTED PROBABLY EVERY SINGLE HOUSING. BILL THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED MOSTLY BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY WHAT A CRISIS WE HAVE AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITIES ARE RESISTANT AND SOME THAT. THAT AND THEN WITH THEY NEEDED TO BUT- WHEN I LOOK AT THIS I WORRY BECAUSE THIS MAY HAVE WORKED IN SAN DIEGO BUT SAN DIEGO IS A IS A HIGHLY URBANIZED. AS I BELIEVE THAT. BUST TRANSFER. PUBLIC COUNTY. SYSTEM AND THAT REALLY IS BENEFICIAL WHEN YOU'RE STARTING THE INCREASED DENSITIES AND- I DID BONUS THEY WITH THIS FOR DOES. ABOUT IT SO I GET CONCERNED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR US TO TAKE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS DOLLARS AND USE IT TO BUILD PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. INTO THE SUBURBS. BRINKLEY THAT REALLY HASN'T TO FRUITION AND SO- IF I COULD CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE FIVE. OF THE ANALYSIS WHAT WHAT THE ANALYSIS SAYS IS AND I AND I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. AS YOU. DO YOU MOVE THROUGH THE DENSITY BONUSES WHERE THE IMPACTS ON YOUR DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND THERE'S FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALWAYS GOOD THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN START TO DECIDE WHAT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE INCENTIVES ARE AND- THE DENSITY BONUS. BECAUSE IT IT. OPPORTUNITY FOR. US TO SEE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILT BUT- BUT ON PAGE FIVE. THE ITEM NO TEN TALKS ABOUT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PARKING. LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN REQUIRE OF A CHECKED FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. TO FROM POINT FIVE SPACES PER UNIT TO ZERO SPACES PER UNIT AND WHAT IMMEDIATELY JUMPS INTO MY MIND IS FOR ALL THE UNITS WHICH MEANS THERE WOULD BE NO PARKING REQUIREMENT AS I READ THAT SENTENCE THE PARKING REQUIREMENT FOR PROJECT. AND DISTINGUISH. A TWENTY UNIT PROJECT. AND A TWO HUNDRED UNIT PROJECT AND SO I GET CONCERNED ABOUT. USING AND URBAN. MODEL AND SAYING THIS IS HOW WE SHOULD INTERPRET DENSITY BONUSES ALL OVER THE STATE SO I HATE TO PUT YOU IN A POSITION OF TRYING TO DEFEND THAT WHAT AND THEN BUT THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I'M COMING. I REALLY LIKE ON SEPT IN THE AND THEN I STARTED AT THE DETAIL AND I'M I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK WELL IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RICH I REPRESENTS- IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT AND- THAT WOULD BE FINE. TO CHECK. ON OUR WITNESS. SIR PLEASE. ABSOLUTELY MISTER PARENT. YEAH THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT ELEMENT TO THE BILL DOESN'T. MEAN THAT AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS WON'T HAVE PARKING WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT- DEVELOPER YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES IT BROWN PROFIT AND HE WILL GET. HOW MUCH PARKING THEY NEED FOR THE OF THE- BUT THE CREATING WHOLE. AND SO AT AS OPPOSED TO HAVE IT BE CREATED BY. BY US COUNCIL SUPER TO FOR EXAMPLE OF A DEVELOPER IS DOING A PROJECT FOR FAMILY HOMELESS VETERANS WHO MADE IT AND THEY HAPPEN TO KNOW. THAT THEIR POPULATION. UNLIKE CARS THE NATION IS PARTY AT THE NECESSARY .COM THEIR- NEXT OPPOSED POINT TO A. A SET OF RULES THIS WHICH MIGHT HELP EARLIER AND JUST SHARE TO WHAT IS THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO PARKING. MINIMUMS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS AND PROJECTS THAT ARE ON YOUR TRANSIT I DIDN'T SEE BONUS LAW CURRENTLY ALREADY DOES THIS JUST THIS JUST MAKES A LITTLE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR DEVELOPERS USING. BY ME TO ON TO THAT I JUST BE OF IT IS A NOT IN ANY WAY. A DEVELOPER WHETHER IT'S A NUMBER FOR ABOUT TO. OR WHATEVER TO HAVE MORE. AND WHAT IT DOES IS PREVENT A CUTTER. APPROACH BECAUSE WE HAVE. SOME LOCAL LAWS THAT BUT YOU HAVE TO THIS MINIMUM. INSTEAD OF ABOUT PARKS THAT IF YOU'RE A- URBAN I. HI TRANSIT AREA YOU GOING TO LOS PARK. THERE IS AN AREA WITH TREND NEARBY WITH. IT'S LIKELY UP. THE BILL OVER TO MAKE I MUCH BUT WE BASICALLY BY PROJECT INSTEAD OF A COOKIE CUTTER. LOS ST STE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I PUT THE CALM BUT I GUESS WHAT WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE FINAL DECISION IN THE END. AND I AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE IN. THAT THAT I HAVE SUPPORTED REDUCED REQUIREMENTS THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. THE ISSUE IS WHO MAKES THE DECISION AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THINGS CHANGE OF TIME. I'D SAY EVERY DAY IN IRAQ HAVE NOT SEEN A REDUCTION IN VEHICLES AND SO MOST OF THE HOUSING UNITS. IN THE CITY OF SALINAS AND IN A LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE THREE AND FOUR CARS PER UNIT BECAUSE ARE SO OVERCROWDED. SO MY CONCERN IS. TO NOT HAVE A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH TO ALLOWING A WAIVER IF YOU'RE DOING A DENSITY BONUS THAT THEN DOESN'T GIVE THE CITY COUNCIL AND ABILITY TO SAY YOU GOT A ROUTE WHERE YOUR- YOUR FOLKS ARE GOING TO PARTICIPATE. IN FOR THIS HOUSE IS PAID. THIRTY IN NEIGHBORHOODS IT I'VE SEEN IT ALREADY AND SO THAT I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE I'M GONNA LAY OFF FOR THIS RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA GO BACK. THIS HEARING- UP HI I'M CONCERNED AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE- I AM EXPERT TESTIMONY- WHETHER IT'S A NONPROFIT DEVELOPER. OR IT'S A FOR PROFIT DEVELOPER IN IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S STILL THE SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE RENTING AND THEY HAVE THE SAME VEHICLES AND YOU JUST. MS SO. I MADE TWENTY THANK YOU SO MUCH.

BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE ZONE A GREAT DEAL OF THE LAND IN OUR STATE TO SOME REASONS WHICH HAS A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS ABOUT THE EFFICIENCY OF EFFICIENT USE OF LAND. GIVEN GIVEN CHANGING PLAN. WILDFIRE RISK IN PUNISHING COMMUTES. THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT. THE STATE WILL GUARANTEE CITIES CREDIT TOWARD THEIR STATE ISSUED HOUSING TARGETS FOR EVERY SITE THAT IS UP SOON FROM SINGLE FAMILY FOUR PLEXUS. THE VALUE TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IS THAT THEY CAN CALCULATE THIS CREDIT UP FRONT. RATHER THAN AT THE END OF THE PROCESS AFTER AN EXPENSIVE AND TIMELY PROCESS OF ANALYSIS BY LOCALS AND REVIEW BY THE STATE. THIS BILL BUILD GUARDRAILS I'M SURE THE NEW UNITS COULD BE CREATED. ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAKES AND BY RIGHT. THAT THERE AREN'T OTHER STANDARDS THAT RENDERED THE UPS OWNING IN FEASIBLE. AND CITIES ARE ALSO INCENTIVIZED TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CREDIT GRANTED BY THIS BILL ALLOWING HEDT GIVEN ADDITIONAL CREDIT IF THEY DO SO. THIS BILL BALANCES THE NEEDS ARE IN TERMS OF HOUSING PRODUCTION. AND IS SUPPORTED BY BOTH EMTS ON ONE SIDE AND PRO HOUSING. FORCES AS WELL AS CITIES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT WILL RESULT. IN MORE HOUSING IN LOCATIONS CHOSEN BY CITIES IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS WITHOUT. LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS WHOSE CHRISLEY.

OKAY WONDERFUL WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER LIKE KELSEY. MISTER CHAIRMAN A QUESTION ON THE COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT DATE YOU KNOW H. AWAY SHE SAID EIGHT EXISTS I UNDERSTAND IT IT'S- NOW ON IN THE BILL IF THEY CANNOT AND RECENTLY RESTRICT. THEIR TRIBE PASS WITH PASSED THE AUTHOR IF THE CITY CITY COUNCIL DECIDES IT ALL H. WERE YOURS WILL BE- ZONE FOR THIS FOUR PLEX WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT IN THE NORMAL. ENTITLEMENT PROCESS WITH THE H. AWAY I GUESS BERRIER THERE. I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE HOUSING ELEMENT BUT I WILL THROUGH THE TERRIBLE- ASK THE AUTHOR COMMENT ON A- ASSEMBLY THAT THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE CAT'S FROM BANNING. ON RESUMING RESTRICTING AND BASICALLY APPLICATION THIS BILL- THERE BEEN SOME CONCERNS THAT SOMEHOW. WHAT ARE CURRENTLY. LANGUAGE WHEN IT COMES TO SEE IDEAS AND HOAS WOULD- WOULD WOULD WOULD CREATE AN ISSUE HERE. LAST YEAR THERE WAS A BILL THAT PROHIBITED CITIES FROM BANNING. EIGHTY YOU AND- CONSTRUCTION WE WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE WE'RE FOLLOWING THAT AS WELL. YEAH WHAT WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW WHEN WE SAY WE GIVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE RIGHT WHO IS THE ABOLITION EL HAGE HI THIS USE BY RIGHT AND WE CHANGED IT HAD CLOSING ELEMENT WHEN WE IDENTIFY ALL THE SITES I DON'T ANTICIPATE A CLASH WITH H. AWAY ASSOCIATIONS ON THE DETERMINATION WHEN SOMEBODY ACTUALLY APPLIES FOR BUT YOU KNOW IT'S MAYBE THAT'S- PART. BUT IT'S- ONE OF THE CONCERN. OKAY CENTER COUNTY WITHOUT IT OR DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. OKAY ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. REGARDING AB THIRTY FORTY. OKAY SEEING NINE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT AND RESPOND TO SOME OF THE- THE OPPOSITION THAT WAS REYES AND JUST CLARIFY A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS GOING TO GENTRIFY. NEIGHBORHOODS AND MY PERSONAL THAT THANKS TO YOUR GOOD CENTER CENTER SKINNER SB THREE THIRTY PROVIDES DEMOLITION PROTECTIONS. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ALSO PROPOSED A BILL BUT I JUST KNOW THAT THANKS TO THE BILL I THINK WE'VE A GOOD RESPONSE AND REAL PROTECTIONS IN THAT AREA AND THEN I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL REALLY AND SENT THE CONVERSION OF WHAT WILL LIKELY BE. MORE EXPENSIVE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES INTO MULTIPLE SMALLER LESS EXPENSIVE HOMES SO I THINK IT'LL HAVE ACTUALLY OPPOSITE IMPACTS OF WHAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED. OUR SUGGESTION AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO HAVE THAT AS ONE OF THE LEADING. TRANSPORT WHILE FUNDING. WORKING WITH. HOW DO. HOUSING ALL LEVELS OF AFFORDABLE ARE AND THIS ISN'T WAY TO GET THERE THERE WAS ALSO A SURGE THAT SOME THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO A LESS OF DIVERSE NAY AND I FIRST ONE JUST NOTE THAT WE'VE NEVER BEEN APPROACH AS A AS A FORMER CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY THIS IS A SPECIAL I WOULD BE ACUTELY KING TO. HOW NOT PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONS WERE. BLACK LATINO OR FATHER SAID RIGHTS ARE CONCERNED WITH THIS POINT. ONE OF CALPERS POINTED OUT ARE BEATING THE- HISTORY OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AS SOMETHING. THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND I WOULD WOULD AGREE TO THAT- OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ENSURE REAL DIVERSITY IN IN ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS. IN OUR STATE- BLESSING I WANT TO JUST MENTION IS WRITTEN THIS ISSUE OF LOCAL CONTROL- THERE WAS A SUGGESTION FOR EXAMPLE POTENTIAL FIRE SAFETY ISSUES. THIS I TRUE LOCAL CAN. TO LOCAL CHURCH TO THE DECISION OF WHETHER THEY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INCENTIVE THAT'S EMBODIED EMBODIED IN THIS BILL. FOR ARE OR WHETHER THEY WANT TO REZONE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THEIR CITY IT'S COMPLETELY UP TO THEM. SO IF THERE'S A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT POTENTIALLY COULD INVOLVE FIRE SAFETY ISSUES. A CITY COULD CHOOSE NOT TO. USE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THERE WERE SIMPLY TRYING TO GIVE ANOTHER TOOL. TO A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DECIDE AS THEY SEE FIT SO AGAIN FOR ALL THAT THE OPPOSITION IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. YOU WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE AS YOU DO IN YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE PROPER DEVELOPMENT AND UP WITH THAT. I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUPPORT OF. ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT LOCAL JURISDCTIONS WHICH- OBVIOUSLY THIS HOUSING CRISIS AND PROMISES CRISIS WE'RE DOING WE WANT TO DO ALL WE CAN. TO WIN SINCE THESE TO CONTROL. MORE AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HI. IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL. MOTION SENATOR ROTH EMERALD THE ROLL. THIRTY FORTY BY SOME MEMBER TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CENTER WINNER BY WINTER BY SEVERAL. MORRELL NOW SENATOR BATES NO BATES NO CABALLERO HI CABALLERO HI TORONTO HI DORADO MCGUIRE. MORLOCK MORLOCK HI ROTH NAY ROTH AYE SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE NUMBER. NUMBER FIVE HOTEL SKI SKI ICE. EIGHT TWO OKAY THAT'S NOT FOR TO GET OUT WILL PUT ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS- AND WE WILL NOW SINCE THE SUMMER SHE WAS HERE WE WILL- SKIP AHEAD TO ITEM FIFTEEN AB THREE TWO SIX NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY PRESENT. THE SB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN WOULD ADDRESS. SAYS ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS A COMMITTEE THE KNOWS FULL WELL THE DARK CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF OUR NEIGHBORS WERE HOMELESS. OUR STATE HAS HAD THE HIGHEST RATE OF ONE SHELTER HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE COUNTRY. SO WE ALL KNOW THAT AS MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HOUSE. MORTON FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS. WITH THE PANDEMIC. CARE BINGE PROJECTIONS OF HOMELESSNESS COULD INCREASE BY FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT. AS A RESULT OF THE RESEARCH. FOR EVEN MORE IF WE DON'T ADDRESS WHAT HAPPENED. AFTER JUDICIAL. THIS. TWENTY THIS IS A BILL THAT CAME OF TO. FOR EARLIER THIS. THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL ON REGIONAL HOMELESS ADVISORS HEADED UP BY THE FORMER SENATE PRO TEM. AND MAYOR OF ST. WILL START. WITH A WITNESS TODAY. PROPOSED A STELLAR OF AN ENFORCEABLE RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY MANDATE TO END HOMELESSNESS. SINCE PURELY VOLUNTARY EFFORTS BY MYRIAD OF LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FUNDING. HAVE FAILED. CHECK THIS BILL COMES OUT OF A CONVERSATION RELATED TO LAWSUITS. BEFORE CORONAVIRUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE COME UNDER INTENSE LEGAL PRESSURE TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. ADVOCATES OF SUCCESSFULLY SUED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE WHO FAIL TO HOUSE PART ON SHELTER. FOR EXAMPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY FEDERAL JUDGE DAVID CARTER. SUCCESSFUL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE TO PROVIDING EMERGENCY SHELTER BUT THAT PROCESS WAS VERY COMPLEX EXPENSIVE. AND TIME CONSUMING BOTH FOR GOVERNMENTS AND IT'S- SINCE THEN THE TERM OF FIVE A LAWSUIT. FOR SENT INTO LETTERS TO ANGELES SAN DIEGO SANTA CRUZ SACRAMENTO SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS AROUND STATE. THIS BILL WOULD A PROCESS MOVING STATED IN SEASON GOVERNMENT COUNCIL FOR HOUSING OR UNSHELTERED BASED ON MEASURABLE GOALS AND EXISTING RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED IN DOING THIS WITHOUT EXPENSIVE OR TIME CONSUMING LAWSUITS. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO COMPLETE A GAPS A NEEDS ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE. IT REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COMPLETE THE GAPS A NEEDS ANALYSIS AND TO WORK REGIONALLY TO CREATE AN ACTUAL PLAN TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS BY 90% BY THE- TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AND WE'RE- SINCE. THE WHOLE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNT OF FOR FAILING TO SUBMIT A PLAN FOR NOT TO SUBMIT A PLAN. AGAIN THE IDEAS BY HOLDING ALL OF US ACCOUNTABLE BASED ON BENCHMARKS IN PLANTS HOPEFULLY THIS WILL MOVE CALIFORNIA TOWARD FINALLY ADDRESSING MORE CRISIS OF OUR DAY. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO OR ONE MELENDEZ AND SUPPORT THE FORMER PRO TEM OF THIS BODY THE MAYOR SACRAMENTO MISTER DARRELL STEINBERG. OKAY WE WILL NOW GO TO- MAYOR STEINBERG BY MAYOR BACK TO THE SENATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND THANK YOU TO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR OFFERING THIS BILL AND TAKING ON THIS. IMPORTANT CHALLENGE YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN IN YOUR SHOES AND- I APPRECIATE. THE DIFFICULTY IN THE COMPLEXITY- MAKING PUBLIC POLICY IN THIS ARENA AMONG SO MANY JURISDICTIONS AND LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND HOW DO WE MAKE PROGRESS ON WHAT SOMETIMES SEEMS LIKE. A MOST INTRACTABLE ISSUE. AND I THINK THAT MAYBE THE LUXURY BEING OUT- AND CHAIRING THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE HERE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AS DID MY COLLEAGUES WHO SERVED WITH ME. TO ASK A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS WHY IS IT THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN THE AREA OF HOMELESSNESS. THE MOST CERTAINLY PRIOR TO THE CORONAVIRUS THE MOST SERIOUS HEALTH. PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES FACING OUR STATE WHY IS EVERYTHING WE DO. VOLUNTARY AND OPTIONAL WHY IS THERE NOTHING IN THE LAW THAT SAYS THAT ALL OF US WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING THIS PROBLEM BETTER AND SAVING THE LIVES WHY AREN'T WE REQUIRED COLLECTIVELY TO MOVE TOWARDS GETTING MORE PEOPLE OFF THE STREET INTO INTO HOUSING ALTERNATELY. A ROOF- AT FIRST AND WHATEVER SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED TO. I AM VERY LIVES. THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO USE PUBLIC POLICY TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION AND I BELIEVE IT DOES SO IN A VERY INTELLIGENT WAY. IT SAYS THAT OVER AND AGGRESSIVE BUT REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME THAT ALL OF US EVERY CITY EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MUST BE MUST MOVE TOWARDS- ACHIEVABLE BENCHMARKS IN REDUCING THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNSHELTERED. AND IT IS. A AS THE CHAIRMAN SAID THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE SAID. MR TO. APPOINT AN INSPECTOR GENERAL TO ENSURE THAT ALL JURISDICTIONS ARE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH TOWARDS MEETING THE BENCHMARKS. THIS IS ESSENTIAL AT LEAST SOME FORM OF THIS IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE NO AMOUNT OF MONEY. HE'S GOING TO CHANGE SOME OF THE DYSFUNCTIONS FRANKLY THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR HOMELESS SERVICES AND HOUSING SYSTEMS. THE MULTIPLICITY OF JURISDICTIONS THE FACT THAT MONEY IS NOT. THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO CONSOLIDATE RESOURCES ACROSS. TO MEET CASH PARKS THE FACT THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HOMELESS SHELTERS OR HOMELESS RELATED HOUSING IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS THE FACT THAT COLLECTIVELY WILL NOT DRIVEN TOWARDS A GOAL. IT WE MUST BE DRIVEN TOWARDS GOAL. AND SO I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASS THIS BILL. AND KNOWING THAT WERE LIVING IN THE MIDST OF A VERY DIFFICULT TIME CANNOT FORSAKE. ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND HOMELESSNESS IN LEGISLATIVE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY JUST BECAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN A TOUGH TIME THE BENCHMARKS THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU HAS IDENTIFIED ARE REASONABLE THE PROCESS TO DEVELOP BENCHMARKS I SHOULD SAY ARE VERY REASONABLE THEIR COLLABORATIVE. AND I KNOW SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE OPPOSED OR AT LEAST. OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED I WOULD JUST REMIND EVERYONE THAT AMONG I BELIEVE THE SIX THIRTEEN MEMBER TASK FORCE THAT THE GOVERNOR APPOINTED. A NUMBER NINETY SUPERVISORS AND CITY. AND MAYORS. AND SO THIS ISN'T A MANDATE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THIS IS A CALL TO ACTION FOR ALL. OF US. TO CREATE A- NOT A LEGAL RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT MAYBE I ORIGINALLY ADVOCATED ALREADY DISSIPATED. BUT A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATION ON ALL OF US TO DO THE RIGHT THING ON BEHALF OF THIS ISSUE LATER ON BEHALF OF TOO MANY SUFFERING PEOPLE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. I THANK YOU MR MAYOR- WE WILL NEXT GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT WILL ASK PEOPLE TO LIMIT THEIR REMARKS. TO THE NAME ASSOCIATION OF ANY AND YOUR SUPPORT- IN THE GALLERY GO AHEAD.

EVERYONE ADMIN OF THE COMMITTEE. KIANA VALENTINE ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA THIS AFTERNOON. REGRETFULLY OPPOSED AND- AB THREE TWO SIX NINE ONE ARE THE POSITION FOR US ARRIVE AT AT AND WE- TOOK SOME TO GET THERE BECAUSE COUNTY THE GREED THAT COMPREHENSIVE AND AGGRESSIVE NEW STRATEGY IS REQUIRED TO MEANINGFULLY. REDUCE HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES COUNTY IS BELIEVE THAT ANY NEW APPROACH NEEDS TO INCLUDE AT LEAST. THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL ELEMENT. CLEARLY ARTICULATED GOAL DEFINE ROLES IN RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN STATE COUNTY AND CITY GOVERNMENTS. THERE IT ONGOING FUNDING TO FULFILL THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE CHEAP. AND TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO HOLD EACH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRUDENT USE OF STATE RESOURCES. ALTHOUGH ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE TWO SIX NINE GENERALLY INCLUDES ARTICULATED GOAL BY SPECIFYING A PLANNING PROCESS AND REDUCTION TARGETS IN THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS INSPECTOR GENERAL IN COURT INTERVENTION PROP. HOWEVER THE MEASURE IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED DOES NOT PARTICULARLY CLEAR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR EACH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. NOR DID IT PROVIDE THE ON GOING YOU WERE THAT ARE VITAL FOR SUCCESS OUTCOMES. IN SHORT EIGHTY THREE TO SIX NINE CURRENTLY FOCUSES ON PLANNING WITHOUT FUNDING THE PROCESS PRESCRIBED THE SOLUTION WITHOUT A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS AND GAPS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. AND FOCUS AS OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT FINDING YOU AND TO ACHIEVE PROGRESS. CONSIDERING THE CURRENT FISCAL CLIMATE IN THE UNCERTAINTY THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE DUE TO THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WE BELIEVE THAT IF THE BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD ABSENT A MORE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IT SHOULD TAKE A MORE MEASURED APPROACH THIS YEAR THAN ITS CURRENT FORM. AND WE HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS TO THIS AND- AT THE TWO MOST CRITICAL AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE OFFERED IS STILL REQUIRING MANDATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCAL HOMELESSNESS PLANTS AND ALL FIFTY CAO PUTTING. IN THAT PROCESS THERE SO AND THREE. BUT PER THE FUNDING AFTER TO THE PLANNING PROCESS. AND SECONDLY TWO DIFFERENT ACTION ON SETTING GOALS AND MILESTONES TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. UNTIL THE LOCAL PLANS ARE COMPLETED AND THE DOWN THERE GOT. ALL PARTIES CAN. THE DATA AND ALSO HAVE A ROBUST. AB THE FINE ROLES AND- SO AGAIN COUNTY THAT AN AGGRESSIVE NEWS ON HOMELESSNESS IS NOT. AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF TAKING THE BEGINNING SEPT ABOUT STRATEGY THIS YEAR- WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AIR SIGN LEADERS ON THE CHRIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND LOOK FORWARD. TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH BOTH OF THEM IN PURSUIT OF A COPPER NEW HOMELESSNESS STRATEGY THAT WILL LEAD. OR DO THINGS. THANK YOU VERY WE WILL MAIL ON THIS BOB COMMON IS A ROOM.

OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING ABOUT THE COMMITTEE- FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER MCALISTER'S. MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAVE A- QUESTION REGARDING- D. RID OF MEN. HAVE MANDY. DAVIS PROCESS- IT'S HIGHLIGHTED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE STAFF REPORT. HE NOTICES BECAUSE OF THE COVERT WORK THIS BILL NORMALLY WE GO TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S- FIVE CHALLENGE HERE ABOUT THE THAT THIS GENERAL MAKING OF. MAKING THE DETERMINATION ON ON WHO'S FAILED. TO DO THIS AND THEN. I DON'T WANT TO PRE ORDER AND FOR FROM THE COURTS BUT HAVING COURTS RATHER USE INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT SIMPLY- RIPPER STAMPER IS- FACILITATE. THE VEHICLE THAT THE TERM THAT THE MAY SO THAT'S A SERVICE QUESTION IN THIS QUESTION IS THAT THIS. APPEAL. AGAIN IT'S- USUALLY WILL LET THE COR THE- WHAT SHOULD BE EXPERT I'M APPRECIATE THE FORMER PRO TEM'S TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THE CHALLENGE OF HOMELESSNESS BUT TO TELL THE COURTS THAT THESE. THESE ISSUES HAVE. ALEVE ATTENTION IS REALLY YOU KNOW NOT THE TRADITION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OF THE LAWS WOULD HAVE SAID LIKE THE AUTHOR COULD. COMMENT PONDERED. FIVE ISSUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERTAINLY SERVICEABLE AS A GOOD CENTER AND I WERE JUST DISCUSSING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE HEARING AS SOON AS WE GOT THIS COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT WE REACH OUT TO THE CENTER. MANY I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH THEM AND WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES SO THAT'S THE FIRST. THING I WANT TO SAY THAT THE SECOND ONE IS A IS. A THE PURPOSE FOR THIS BILL THIS IS A BILL THAT WE'VE INTRODUCED BECAUSE- WE HOME THIS CRISIS THAT SPANISH PROFOUND IN. IS PENDING NOT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS AN IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL PUT OUT BY THE GOVERNOR'S- ADVISERS SAYS BUT BECAUSE AT THIS MOMENT. ARE ARE ANY. ON THIS. THE MATTER IS A TWO HUNDRED THAT ARE BEING TO BY SEN AND LITIGANTS ARE AT RISK THAT ARE SPENT AND JUST GIVEN ALL THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE- IT'S TAKING AN AWFUL LOT. OUR TOO BAD THE COURT SYSTEM ADDRESSES SUPPORT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO ESSENTIALLY. CREATE A PROCESS BY WHICH- IT ADVOCATES FOR OUR HOMELESS RESIDENTS AND OUR BROADER COMMUNITY KNOW THAT EVERY JURISDICTION IS MAKING REAL HEADWAY TOWARD ADDRESSING THIS AND HOPEFULLY IDEALLY OF GETTING- OUR ALL THE LOSSES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW SO THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. THE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. NOW THAT BEING SAID THAT WAS THIS. EXPEDITING SOME LAWSUITS WOULD WOULD MAKE SENSE OF WE APPRECIATE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S PERSPECTIVE ON THIS WILL BE WORKING THROUGH IT I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO. KEEP YOU ABREAST OF THAT DISCUSSION AS- AS WE AS WE MOVE THROUGH. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MEASURE- I STRONGLY AFFIRM THE DIRECTION OF THIS BILL- THERE'S DEFINITELY BEEN A VACUUM HERE AND I CAN I CAN KIND OF SURE THAT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AFTER BECOMING THE PROVIDER IN TWO THOUSAND SIX- THE COUNTY WAS REAL ACTIVE IN PURSUING. WHAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO DO AND THAT WAS A COMMISSIONED IN HOMELESSNESS AND SO I WAS THE INITIAL CHAIRED SERVED IN THAT POSITION FROM MY- ENTIRE TWO TERMS AND I KNOW IT TAKES YEARS TO TRY AND DEAL WITH ALMOST THE IT'S NOT LIKE OVERNIGHT THING THE GOVERNOR I REALIZE. THAT IS WELL AND STEINBERG IS WELL. SO I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE AND EMPATHIZE WITH. I I'M JUST WONDERING IF THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AND SO MAYBE JUST. BEING SENSITIVE TO. THE COUNTIES AND THE CITIES. I LOOK AT THE THIS WAY IT WOULD IF WE ALREADY HAVE. COMMISSION STAY IN HOMELESSNESS AND WE'RE ALL WORKING ON ENDEAVORS I DON'T KNOW FOR A WHOLE NEW BUREAUCRACY WOULD PERHAPS STAFFING AND ALL THE REST OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IS TO GO I THINK THE GOVERNOR HOLE IS ALREADY GETTING. THEIR PLANS FOR HAS THEM WHILE GETTING THE MINUTES OF THEIR MONTHLY REPORT WE HAVE MONTHLY MEETINGS OF THE WORLD PROGRESS WORKING WITH. ALL THE SILOS PROFITS THE BUSINESSES BERMAN CITIES IS A BIG STEP AS OLD AS YOUR HEAD YOU KNOW WE WERE JUST TRYING TO DO A TEN YEAR PLAN. YOUR TRIP. FOR THAN A- EVERY THING SO MANY REACTIONS AND SO MANY SALUTE AND I'M NOT SO IF MAYBE SOME OF THEM SURE YOU CAN HELP ME IN YOUR CAR OR BUT I I'M NOT SO SURE THIS IS THE WAY THAT GOES I TO GO I AM WITHOUT WITH. ANILINGUS I WOULD PREFER FOR SOME OF COLLABORATE. EFFORT THAT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THREE WORK AND THEN SEE HOW THAT GOES AND THEN SEE IF WE NEED SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE- I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO. DIGITIZATION ERROR HEAVY HANDED IS WHAT COMES TO MINE AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT ONE BUT I PER WHAT WE WHAT DOING I'M THERE MY HEARTS THERE. I JUST. I JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S A LITTLE. DIFFERENT WAY TO. ATTEMPT TO MOVE THE SENATE THAT SUPPLY INPUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. FIVE THANK YOU AND- SUMMER OF A CLOSE CENTER BATES. I THINK YOU ARE DETERMINED WIENER ODD COUPLE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL A PROBABLY. ONE THAT I THINK IS OUTSTANDING AS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CIVIL PENALTY A COMMUNITY THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TRANSPORTING HOMELESS FROM ITS COMMUNITY TO ANOTHER AND BECAUSE SIDE THE HOMELESS POPULATION THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN OUR COUNTY TRANSCANADA HAS TO BE SOME. SORT OF CONTROL ON IT AND IT NEEDS TO BE PRESENTED HER FINDINGS THAT WOULD BE PRESENTED TO ACTUALLY INSURE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS NOT. BASED ON WHAT I'M READING THAT IT DOES NOT EVEN GO ON THROUGH THE COURTS IT'S REMAINS WITHOUT THIS NEW INSPECTOR GENERAL- OFFICE FOODS SO THAT'S ONE MAJOR CONCERN EITHER ONE OF. OUR CERTAINLY INTERVIEWS WITH THOSE WHO WERE STEPPING UP FOR. I OF THE HAS MADE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IT WAS INTERESTING TO NOTE. THAT PROJECT A ROOM KEY WHICH WAS FIVE. YOU KNOW A NEW. SOLUTION TO HOMELESS DURING OF THE OF SIGNIFICANT OUTBREAK EARLY AND THE COVE IN NINETEEN SITUATION. HAS BEEN CHANGED- MOVED TO OUR PROJECT HOME KEY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE GOING TO INVEST MONEY AND- ACTUALLY PURCHASING ALL MOTELS HOTELS THAT ARE WILLING. PROVIDE HOPPING FOR IN THE. SOMETHING THAT WILL A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CAN GOVERNMENTS THE STATE SO THIS SEEMS TO BE REALLY A HEAVY HANDED BEFORE WE'VE- THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE- THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. DON'T COMPLY IN THE SHORT TERM WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE ALREADY TO TRY TO ADDRESSED AND ALL OF THE VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. THAT WE HAVE WITH HOME FILE UNDER PROJECT A ROOM KEY PAUL LEVENTHAL FLYNN NO ROOMS WERE PURCHASED OR LEASED. OR FINANCED YET ONLY OCCUPIED THAT SUGGESTS THAT. THE TRANSIENT NATURE OF HOMELESS ON THE PROBLEMS THAT PROBABLY ARE BASICALLY ALL SIGNIFICANT HIM OUT. DO THING PERCENT. OF SO I THINK IT'S PER INTO WE HAVE THE BIGGER PLAN WE PRIDE. HOME KEY TO SEE IF WE ARE ABLE THROUGH THOSE PARTNERSHIPS OF THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT THE HEAVY HAND OF ANOTHER BUREAUCRACY AND A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN- THAT IS GOING TO BE. DESPITE TO COMPLAIN THAT MADE HAVE ANY FINDING WHICH IS SOMEONE WHO THINKS IT SHOULD BE DONE DIFFERENTLY. AND I HATE TO GIVE THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY WITHOUT SOME VERY VERY STRIPPED. DOWN CONFORMING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE SUCH HEAVY HANDS COME DOWN ON A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY SPEAKING ABOUT WHERE'S THE WHERE'S THE FUNDING FOLKS WHERE'S THE FUNDING SO- I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BACK. WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY ON THE YEARS THAT I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. CANNOT CERTAINLY THE APRS WITH THE- OWNER ON THE SIR ALL SIGNIFICANT. AND REDUCE. THE NAY IN THE TELEHEALTH COME. OF HOMELESS AND I THINK WE TO GIVE. OUR. INTO THE BEFORE WE TAKE THAT RATHER. HI I THINK. OF STAFF LAW WITH LOCAL THE- AMINA'S HERE TODAY LISTENING TO ALL OF THE OF THESE HOW. VOWED TO FOR MADE LOCAL. I MEAN IT ARE JUST ALL OVER THEM AND I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN WRONG IF WE WANT LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE A VERY STRONG PARTNER FINITARY POSITIVE PARTNER WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SOLVING OUR HOUSING. THE HOMELESS ISSUES. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU CENTER RATES ARE BECAUSE ANY THE COM OR. QUESTIONS OKAY NINE WE USED TO HAVE A MOTION TO PASS BILL. MOTION BY SENATOR RAW AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER FIRST OF ALL VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DETACHMENT IN THE DISCUSSION AND WE ALL KNOW. HOME CONTRACT. CHALLENGE FOR SIMILAR PERCEPTIONS AND- I WOULD HAZARD A GUESS THAT EVERY MEMBER IN THIS BODY HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME INTENSE WAYS OVER THE YEARS TO OUR CAREERS AND TRYING TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME COMMON THAT OUR CALLS FROM ORANGE COUNTY LATE PARTICULARLY SENATE MORLOCK AROUND YORK COUNTY EXPERIENCED. THIS BILL PART CAME OUT OF WAS INSPIRED BY WHAT IN ORANGE COUNTY WHEN HE SAID IN THE FALL WAY. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS. CITIES AND THE COUNTY THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH HOMELESSNESS. AND YET DESPITE THOSE EFFORTS YOU WERE SUED BY ADVOCATES. AND THROUGH A MULTI YEAR PROCESS YOU HAD A FEDERAL JUDGE. WHO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES. IN FAVOR OF CITIES AND COUNTIES DOING MORE TOGETHER. AND AT THIS MOMENT WE HAVE LAWSUITS- THAT ARE SIMILAR THAT ARE THREATENING JURISDICTIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING. TAKE A STEP. AS SIGNIFICANT COST AND I WOULD SUGGEST WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MOST HEAVY HANDED WAY OF APPROACHING THIS. WE ASK FIRST AND FOREMOST THROUGH THIS BILL ARE THAT THE STATE WORK WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ENGAGE AND- AN ANALYSIS OF GAPS IN NEEDS ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. MEMBERS HAVE DONE THEM. WE HAVE NO AN- WHAT HAPPENED AND REALLY SORT OF. EFFORTS ON AND WE ASK TO COME UP A PLAN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO OVER THE EIGHT. TO HOMELESSNESS AND A SIGNIFICANT WAY. ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CARE OUT I WOULD SUGGEST WE HAVE THE LATEST FORM OF. OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS WITH AN INSPECTOR GENERAL- THAT WOULD ONLY UNTIL A FEW STAFF TO ENSURE THAT. THE NEEDS ANALYSIS HAPPENS THE PLANT PROBLEMS AND THESE JURISDICTIONS ARE HELD ACCOUNT. ON I WANT ALSO RESPOND A NEW SERVED TO ASKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE ALL KNOWN OR COMMUNITIES AROUND HOMELESSNESS DUMPING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE LITERALLY IN FOLKS DOWN THE ROAD TO MAKE CITY THE NEXT COUNTERPART IN THE STATE WE ALWAYS SEEM TO A STOP AND DIE AS I COMMITTED TO CENTER WHITE HOUSE KEY CERTAINLY IN OUR CONVERSATION WITH SENATE COMMITTEE FOR HELPING. EUROPE IS THE- RIGHT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO SELF AGAIN I HAVE TO KEEP OF ON AS I DO. THANK IN GETTING OF OUR LOCAL JR AND SAY THAT IF YOU IF YOU DON'T THE COMMERCE WITH HAD WITH SAID IN URBAN COUNTIES AND OTHER. THERE'S A THAT WE CAN AGREE ON I THINK ALL AGREE WE NEED TO SKIP. SAYS WE NEED TO DO PLAN. AND I THERE WAS A SURGE THAT SOME THIS BILL DOESN'T PROVIDE FOR. AND I APPS CAN THAT PER THIS. AND FOR. IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE GAS. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PROBLEM. AND WHAT WE AS WE- ONCE WE- GAP IS AND WE KNOW WHAT THAT SAY WE- CONTRACT REVENUE GAP. WE WILL SERVE HAVEN'T COME IN THE FUTURE. ON RESEARCH WITH BUT ONE THING THOSE VERY. THIS PSPO IS WITH. DO NOT LOCAL BIRTH A- FOR DOING MORE TO SOURCE THEY HAVE. A VERY L. O. NO WORLD OVERTURES TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO NOW UP IN SAID HI WE ARE SO VERY MUCH A DISCUSSIONS WITH A LOCAL. WE WILL TO MAKE THIS WORK HI AND MY HOPE BELIEF THAT IN THE COMING WEEK WE WILL. BE ABLE TO. FINE TUNE THE INTERNAL THIS AND WAY THAT WILL MAKE SENSE OF. WHAT THAT. GENDER MUCH A- TWENTY AND UP. AND UP FOR ALL OF US WE NEED TO MAKE A MAJOR STEP IN THIS. IT IS. NOT JUST. HAVE TO DO BECAUSE CONSTRAINTS ARE ASKING THE- BUT WE- THIS BECAUSE IT IS THE THING DO. BOTH BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND CERTAINLY DURING PANDEMIC SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY FOR SOME. FIVE THANK YOU. DID I ASK FOR A VOTE YES SAN RAFIU THE BILL- EVERYONE NOW CALL THE ROLL.

THE BATRES WE WILL BE AMENDING THE BILL TO ALLOW HOAS WITH TIME BASED RENTAL VANS LONGER THAN THIRTY DAYS OF THOSE TIME FRAMES AUTOMATICALLY REDUCED TO THIRTY DAYS UNTIL THE HOAS CAN UPDATE THEIR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS THE AUTHORS ALSO AMENDING THE BILL TO PAY OUT THE RIGHT OPTION AS TO. IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE AND HOUSE DEBT THE JUDICIAL CANNOT COMMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS. BOB HOAS GOVERN 25% OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN AN H. AWAY. I'M TO DO A LOOPHOLE IN STATE LAW HM REYES AND OTHER COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS ARE ALLOWED TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT HOMEOWNERS FROM RENTING OUT THEIR HOMES THEY CAN ALSO BE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTY USE. WHAT AB THIRTY ONE EIGHTY TWO DOES. IS SOLVES THAT ISSUE BY AMENDING THE DAVIS STERLING ACT WHICH- GOVERNS COMMON LINE COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS. TO LIMIT AREAS WHERE HOAS CAN BE AN INTIMATE RENTERS. THE BILL SAYS THAT ANY PROVISION OF THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS OF A COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT THAT EFFECTIVELY PROHIBITS RENTALS IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE THERE TO ADDRESS THE PHONES CONCERNS THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO ALLOW HOAS TO CAP RENTALS. AT 25% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOMES. WHICH IS CURRENTLY BELOW THE ALLOWABLE. THAT EXISTS IN MOST HOAS AND THE 70% FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION CONDOMINIUM SWITCHES ALLOWED REQUIRED BY FHA AND THE VETERANS IS IT VA. WHAT THIRTY ONE EIGHTY TWO REALLY DOES IS CLOSE A VERY IMPORTANT LOOPHOLE TO MAKE NEW AND EXISTING HOUSING AVAILABLE TO MORE CALIFORNIANS. AND WE HAVE.

MINIMUM RENTAL PERIOD OF SIXTY EVEN NINETY DAYS- AND THIS BILL WOULD CAPITA THIRTY DAYS- IT MAY TAKE OUT TIME FOR SOME USERS SO IF TO CHANGE OUR DOCUMENTS- THE WAY THAT THE BILL IS STRUCTURED. IT COULD BE INTERPRETED THAT IF YOU DIDN'T QUICKLY CHANGING DOCUMENT BY JANUARY FIRST. EFFECTIVE DATE YOUR SUCCESS TODAY MINIMUM. FIVE REQUIREMENT WOOD RENTAL REQUIREMENT WOULD BE JUST ELIMINATED. AND PEOPLE COULD START DOING SHORT TERM RENTALS AND SO THE BILL WILL BE AMENDED. SO THAT AUTOMATICALLY EVEN IF YOU DON'T AND YOUR DOCUMENTS IF YOU HAVE A HIGHER. MINIMUM. WAGE THANK THIRTY.

THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M TO PRESENT MY BILL AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT TO RISK THE RIGHTS CAL TRIBAL GO. TO CON. ON PROJECTS THAT MAY FOR DIMINISH THE CULT AND THE REESE. REMAINING IN OUR STATE. JUST OVER A YEAR AGO ON JUNE SEVENTEENTH GOVERNOR NEWSOM. IS SHOOTING ORDER MARK MORE MEMORIALIZE AN APOLOGY THE COW NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION. HE SAID CALIFORNIA'S RECKONED WITH OUR DARKEST. CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUFFERED VIOLENCE DISCRIMINATION EXPLOITATION SANCTIONED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY. WE CAN NEVER UNDO THE WRONGS INFLICTED ON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED IN ON THIS LAND THAT WE NOW CALL CALIFORNIA SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. WELL WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD BRIDGES. TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR PAST AND BEGIN TO HEAL DEEP WOUNDS. TODAY WE CAN BEGIN TO RIGHT ONE WRONG AND BEGIN TO PUT THOSE WORDS INTO ACTION. FOR MUCH HELLO HISTORY. FILE IN TWO GAMES LEGAL RIGHTS INSTEAD IN THE LAW CONCERNING OF THEIR CULTURAL RESOURCES. THAT AMOUNT OF PROGRESS TOWARD THE SCHOOL WAS ACHIEVED IN SB EIGHTEEN TWO THOUSAND FOUR. AND AB FIFTY TWO IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. IT TWO THOUSAND. IN RECOGNITION OF OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS SB THIRTY FIVE ALLOWED MANY HOUSING PROJECTS TO BE EXEMPTED FROM THE SEQUEL. BUT TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES WERE NOT ON THIS LIST. THERE BY ELIMINATING TRIBAL RIGHTS TO CONSULTATION ON THESE PROJECTS. THE BILL EXEMPTED SEVERAL CATEGORIES OF NON TRIBAL RESOURCES FOR FROM STREAMLINING ELIMINATING ANY OPPORTUNITY INCLUDED INCLUDING NO LEGAL RECOURSE FOR DEVELOPERS TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT THAT IMPACTS A PROTECTED RESOURCE. LET ME BE CLEAR THE APPLICANT CAN ONLY CONTESTING OF AN EXAM RESEARCH. NOT TO PROCEED WITH A PROJECT TO DO WITH A PROJECT TO DAMAGES. THE TRIBAL CULTURE REDUCE THE BURDEN RELIGIOUS RESOURCES WERE LEFT OUT. LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR. I DO NOT BLAME YOU CHAIRMAN WIENER FOR THIS OVERSIGHT AS MANY OF US DELIVERING ON THAT BILL WE'RE ALSO UNAWARE OF THE DAMAGE WE WERE DOING TO TRIBAL RIGHTS. A SHOULD NOT THE FINEST. HOW WE WORK TO FIX IT DOES. WHAT BEGAN WE ALLEGE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN INTRODUCED IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR TO REESTABLISH THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT MAY IMPACT TRAVEL RESOURCES. SENATORS SINCE WE LEFT THIS COMMITTEE WITH A UNANIMOUS VOTE LAST FALL THE ONLY CHANGES MADE TO THE BILL HAVE BEEN MADE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM THE CHAIR. AND THE BUILDING COMMUNITY. WELL AFTER WELL AFTER WELL OVER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATION AND STAKEHOLDERS WITH STAKEHOLDERS CBA THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND HOUSING ADVOCATES. AND NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH MISTER CHAIR AND CONSULTANTS FROM THE THREE SENATE COMMITTEES OF JURISDICTION. HOUSING EQ GOVERNMENT FINANCES WE HAVE MADE SEVERAL ROUNDS OF MAJOR AMENDMENTS. WE HAVE PAINS TO CONSTRUCTED SCOPING LOCATION. FOR SUCH PROJECTS TO STILL STREAMLINING THAT EXISTS NO OTHER NON TRIBAL CATEGORY OF RESOURCE. WE NOW PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROJECTS INVOLVED INVOLVING TCRS TO ACCESS STREAMLINING. PROVIDE FOR NOTIFICATION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A PROJECT INTENSE A LOCAL DEVELOPMENT RULES ARE LOCKED IN PLACE SB THREE THIRTY. AND REQUIRE A NOTIFICATION OF PARTIES WHY PERMIT FOR SB THIRTY FIVE IS BEING REJECTED TO PROVIDE A RECORD OF ANY BAD FAITH DECISION BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AS YOU IN OUR MOST RECENT ME MR CHAIR WE ARE DOWN TO ISSUE. SO I WILL NOT ADDRESS THE- OF OTHER CHIU. WE'VE MADE TO MOVE THE BILL IN A DIRECTION YOU AND THE BUILDING COMMUNITY MIGHT ACCEPT. MOST WILL NOT BE OF INTEREST TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. MOST OF THE REMAINING PROJECTS THAT WARRANT INVESTIGATION WILL NOT THREATEN TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES. FOR THOSE THAT DO AN AGREEMENT TO AVOID OR MITIGATE IMPACTS TO A TRIBAL CULTURE OR RELIGIOUS RESOURCE WILL ALLOW THE PROJECT TO CONTINUE ON TO STREAMLINING. YOU'VE ALSO AGREED MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT THIS THAT THE SUGGESTION THAT TRIBE GOVERNMENTS WOULD MISS. SOMETHING SO CORE TO THEIR CULTURE AND BELIEVES IS ABSURD AND ALTHOUGH SO OPPONENTS MAY WHISPER. THIS COULD BE TRUE TO THEY'VE NEVER GIVEN UP FOR. EXAMPLE OF THIS. EVER ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. WHETHER ANOTHER RESOURCE EXISTS UNDER SB THIRTY FIVE CAN BE CHEN IN COURT. WHEN ONE SUGGESTED CULTURE RESEARCH DOES EXIST. WHAT IT IS. SO THE FINAL ISSUE BY THE COMMITTEE USURY FOR AN TO ALLOW ANY WHO CAN REACH INTO TO AVOID OR MITIGATE A TRY CALL OR RELIGIOUS RESOURCE TO SEEK COURT APPROVAL TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE OBJECTIONS OF THE IMPACT TO TRY. MISTER CHAIRMAN NO MATTER HOW MANY CREATIVE ANSWERS ARE CRAFTED. TO IGNORE THE REALITY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INSTANCES WHICH- QUESTION TRAVEL CULTURE. AND CAN ABOUT ITS EXISTENCE. I CANNOT ACCEPT WHICH WOULD PROVIDE FOR KNOWING DESTROY OF WHAT REMAINS OF TRIBAL HISTORY AND THE CULTURE OF THE STATE. IF AN APPLICANT WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT THE DEMAND DAMAGES OR DESTROYS THE TRIBAL RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL RESOURCE. THAT THAT REALITY EXISTENCE SEQUENCE WHERE AT LEAST THE TRIBES HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE. THE AMENDMENT THIS OP BY YOU DEVELOP STICKER WOULD TAKE AWAY ANY INCIDENT FOR. APPLICANTS TO SEEK A GREEN. KNOWING THEY HAVE THE BACKS OF OUR COURT SYSTEM WOULD. RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TRAMPLED FOR GENERATIONS. THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS IN SEQUENCE AND SHOULD NOT BE MADE EASIER. IF THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AN AMENDMENT TO ALLOW AN APPLICANT TO PURSUE A PROJECT IN A WETLAND THAT'S COASTAL ZONE RUN PROPERTY OF THE COW MISSIONS WHICH ARE CALLED HAS DEEMED HISTORICALLY. THREE COULD BE SO. AND WOULD BE HARSH. A MR CHEN AND SENATORS SB THIRTY FIVE PROVIDES NO. TO FOR OTHER NON REESE WHERE YOU ARE OUT IN THE TRIBES. FURTHER CLAIMS THAT THE BILL GIVE THE TRIBE SOME SORT OF VETO AUTHORITY PERSON UNTRUE. APPLICANTS ARE C. AN UP TO INDUSTRY. AND THE TRIBES HAVE CRAFT A- PROCESS. TO STILL ACCESS STREAMLINING. THE EXEMPTION OCCURS WHEN AN AGREEMENT TO AVOID OR MITIGATE ANY IMPACT OF TRIBAL CULTURE RESOURCE CANNOT BE REACHED. WE HAVE PAINSTAKINGLY CONSTRUCTED A PROCESS FOR SUCH PROJECTS TO STILL INDUSTRY MONEY THAT EXISTS FOR NO OTHER CATEGORY. OF RESOURCE. MORE OVER THE ALTERNATIVE IS NOT NOT BE TERMINATED PROJECT. IT IS THE SEQUEL PROCESS THIS LEGISLATURE HAS RESERVED FOR EVERY OTHER CATEGORY OF NON TRIBAL RESOURCES UNDER SB THIRTY FIVE. AND A PROCESS WHICH BY NATURE WILL BE BRIEF BECAUSE THE APPLICANT MUST CERTIFY NO OTHER C. PUT IN TAXES. THIS CHAIRMAN I WILL GLADLY ENGAGING YOU IN FURTHER DOES TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF LOW AND GOVERNMENTS BUT YOU BELIEVE TO BE AN CLEAR. WHAT I CANNOT ACCEPT. IS A CORPORATE. TO ALLOW PROJECT PROCEED EVEN IT WOULD JUST. A TRIBAL REDUCE. AGAIN THE ABILITY DOES NOT OF FOR ANY OTHER THINGS RESOURCE. EVERYONE HEARING WHO WE'VE DONE BREAKDOWN DAM TO OUR IN OUR TO INDEED PEOPLE AND GOT. I'VE MET WITH OF EACH OF YOU AND WE ALL WE MUST FIX THE ERROR MADE IN SB THIRTY FIVE IT WERE THE HAVE WITH THE FATAL FLAW. THE GOVERNOR SAID LAST YEAR WE MISS READ THE PAIN HAVE BEEN FOR THE- AND TRIED REAP THE REAL. WITH THEIR SAYS SITE TRIBE GOVERNMENTS. FORCING INTO A STACK COURT PROCESS EVERY TIME APPLICANT ONE TO PURSUE TO YET TO HIS. CULTURAL FOR RELIGIOUS RESTORE. FOR THE X. PURPOSE FOR PER TO. IT IS NOT THE WE BE TO REPAIR THE- THAT WE HAVE DONE. SO PAULA FOR IT ARE ERRORS IMPORT ACTIONS IN CHAU WHETHER WE REALLY MEAN THEM. I ASK FOR THIS PER OF A ANSWER SO THE TRIBAL.

THANK YOU FOR ALL THE EFFORTS IF YOU MADE IT HERE AND THE CHAIR OF GOVERNMENT- REVENUE AND THE CHAIR OF P. Q. AND ALL THE STAFF VOTE. DUNDAS I GUESS FIRST I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL HAVE DO THAT I'D LIKE TO COMMENT. ON THE- WE FIND OURSELVES ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF EXEMPTING. PROJECTS FROM SICK AND THE PROMISE OF SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH I VOTED FOR TWO YEARS AGO WE SAID THESE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE INFILL EASY BREEZY PROJECTS THAT WORSE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT WERE. YOU KNOW WE HAD THE CATEGORIES THAT WE ACCEPTED THINGS OUT AND AS I'M LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY FROM THE OPPONENTS AND THE PROPONENTS YOU KNOW WE CAN WERE. THE WRONG STATE CALIFORNIANS HAVE COMMITTED AGAINST IT FOUR AMERICANS HAVE COMMITTED AGAINST THE NATIVE AMERICANS WHETHER IT GOES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL TIME FOR WHEN WE DRAFTED JUSTICE SEQUEL. WHEN WE DRAFTED SYKORA WE ALL MADE IT PROVO TRAVEL CULTURAL RESOURCES AND THAT WAS FIXED IN FIFTY TWO- PUT OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GATTO. WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH BUT DOES. TO A PROJECTS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM STREAMLINING PROJECTS AND YOU KNOW THE SENATE HAS TWO REPORTS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED AT LEAST WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF EQ ONE FROM OUR OWN. INITIATION BOB CALL COMMITTEE THAT PAINS REVIEW OF PRIDE THE FINE OUT THAT REALLY THE AND THE LOT OF THE OPPOSITION IS TALKING ABOUT REALLY YOU'RE NOT SEEK WORK ORIENTED RATHER THEIR LOCAL PLANNING ORGANISER THERE BUT THERE'S A PHILOSOPHY THAT THAT UNLESS WE EXEMPT EXEMPT THINGS THAT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THE PROJECTS COULD BE DONE I THINK THE BILL AND THE AUTHORED. THAT'S WHEN HE MAKES A GOOD POINT THAT THAT THIS WAS. HOWEVER WE WANT TO CHARACTERIZE IT IS SAID. SB THIRTY FIVE DID NOT EMBRACE THE TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE AN EXCUSE TO FAST TRACK THE PROJECTS ARE PLOT EVERYBODY'S EFFORTS TO WORK ON THE BILL TO TRY TO GET SOME RESOLUTION BUT- THE- WITHOUT. WITHOUT SEQUEL WE HAVE NO POSSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC TO COMMUNICATE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME NON. VISIT COAL SOURCES IN. D. IDEA IN THE D. THE IDEA WE'VE EXEMPTS. THIS PROJECTS FROM THE ROBUST DISCUSSION OF THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY ACT IN CALIFORNIA IT SOMEHOW CREATES AN ENTITLEMENT THAT THEY HAVE THAT THAT THAT THE PEOPLE THE DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO DO IT AND THAT SOMEHOW WE CORRECT THAT MOVIE WE CORRECT BILLS ALL THE TIME WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE MADE A MISTAKE AND I'M PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE. OF THE TRIBAL LEADERS IN THE PROPONENTS ARE SAYING YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S GEOGRAPHICALLY DEFINED IS GOING TO BE BUT WE'VE DONE SCREWED SO MANY WRONGS. SLEEPER FOR ALTHOUGH I. VOTED FOR SB THIRTY FIVE FIVE BUT I THINK THAT PUBLIC PROCESS AND THAT. THAT ROBUST DISCUSSION GOES ON SO WITH WITH THAT HI I'M- SOMEWHAT ANNOYED THAT THERE ARE NO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THAT HAVE SPOKEN ON THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS WRAPPED UP WITH WITH C. COOPER WITHOUT A MOVE THE BILL AS IT IS AND I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S EFFORTS. AND CENTER CLARIFY THAT IS A MOTION TO SEND THE BILL TO THE FLOOR. BECAUSE WE'RE A RULE TWENTY NINE TEN. THE SPECIFIC FOR SOME CENTER CHARACTERS MADE A MOTION TO SEND AB ONE SIX IT TO THE FLOOR. THAT IS A MOTION ON THE TABLE. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CALL A. S. SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MEASURE HI I ALWAYS LIKE TO IN BUSINESS MAKE SURE THAT WE AVOID SURPRISES AND SO- I JUST WANNA ASK THE AUTHOR IF THERE IS A YOU KNOW PRETTY GOOD ROBUST THE LISTING OF. TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES THAT. YOU KNOW AND HONEST PERSON WHO'S PURCHASING LAND TO DEVELOP IS NOT STEPPING INTO A SITUATION THAT. EVEN GETS US TO THE POINT THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULLY DISCLOSED AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT IS THE CASE I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LOOK UP HISTORICAL LANDMARKS IN. STATE SENATE A REASONABLY GOOD JOB OF DEDICATING A LOT OF SITES IS STATE HISTORICAL LANDMARKS FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS. I WOULD GO. TRAILER WE'VE GOT BILL GRINDING SITES SOCIAL MOUNTAINS BURIAL GROUNDS SACRED SITES BUT- HOPEFULLY. WE HAVE A GOOD INVENTORY SO THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T EVEN FIND THEMSELVES. VISITATION YES I'LL TURN OVER THE ALL TOURNAMENT BUT I WAS UPSET BECAUSE WE NOW HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH US AND ABOUT THIS AND SO IMPORTANT- THERE ARE SEVERAL CATEGORIES THERE ARE REGISTRIES. OF TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES FEDERAL STATE OR TRIBAL REGISTRIES- AND THESE ARE LISTS THOSE ARE ALL CATEGORICALLY EXEMPT FROM SB THIRTY FIVE UNDER SB ONE SIXTY EIGHT. AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT FIVE ON A REGISTER. OF THINGS CHECKED OF VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT LISTED ON A REGISTRY AND THERE ARE MANY. VERY VERY WHEN. WHY NOT LISTED. ONE OF THOSE REASONS. SIRWHAT DOES THE CURRENT. AND IF YOU HAVE IT IS ON A RED JUST. EVEN IF IT'S THEIR PUBLIC COURTS SUPPOSED TO POKE A PAUL. AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE EITHER INTENSELY OR UNINTENTIONALLY ANNOYS PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SEE SOMETHING AND END UP DAMAGING AT. OR THE- BECAUSE- YOUR. ON THE STRINGS. AND SO IS THEY'RE ARE SOME POWER REASONS WHY THEY ARE ALL LISTED AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I KNOW I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL FIGURE OUT IN THIS BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU WANT TO- COMMENT ON THAT I WOULD LIKE LIKE TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE TRIBAL CANNOT. TO RESPOND AS WELL- I THINK YOU KNOW AS THE SENATOR DID A GOOD JOB RUNNING IDENTIFYING. WHAT THEY'RE WHERE THEY ARE IN THE REGISTRY CIVIC BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONS TO MY COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE THAT. SIR THE STRAND OF A SQUEAL OF ONE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT. OKAY YEAH. PRINCETON. OKAY I'M SORRY APPARENTLY THEY WERE MUTED BECAUSE THE FEEDBACKS OF THE MODERATOR- WHEN YOU I'M YOU MISS MARANDA. YOUR OKAY HELLO YES WE. IT'S A COMMON FACT THAT MEASURE CHARLIE SIGNIFICANT PLACES ARE NOT BROADCASTED TO THE WORLD- LISTED AND LAST THEY ARE THREATENED A HEART WRENCHING HISTORY OF NON CREDENTIALED ARCHAEOLOGIST HISTORIES AND BANDELE THEY'RE DESTROYING ARTIFACTS HAS CAUSED MANY TRIES TO WITHHOLD INFORMATION FROM LOCATION ABOUT PLACES UNTIL THEY ARE ACTUALLY UNDER THREAT. THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE ABOUT THE PLACES THAT IS HELD TIGHTLY WITHIN THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY SOMETIMES ONLY WITHIN CERTAIN ELDERS ARE DESIGNATED SPIRITUAL LEADERS THIS IS BECAUSE THE POWERFUL NATURE THE PLACES CULTURAL LIFE WAYS AND PRACTICES THIS INFORMATION IS NOT LOOSELY OR UNNECESSARILY SHARED IT'S VERY CONFIDENTIAL AND THIS IS BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A LONG HISTORY. WILL BE THREATENED PUNISHED AND EVEN KILL FOR PRACTICING OUR LIFE PLEASE AND REAL. THIS TYPE OF JUDGMENT AND SCRUTINY UNFORTUNATELY STILL OCCURS INSTITUTIONALIZED FORMS AND THIS TRIED TRAUMA AND SEGMENTATION OF TRIBAL BELIEFS DOES NOT CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRIBES AND WANTING TO SHARE THE INFORMATION AND- ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN. SO THE INTERLOCK SOMEONE OF CHOIRS A PIECE OF PROPERTY AND STARTS TO PROCEED BY AND GOES THROUGH THE STEPS OF. AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT AND IF THERE IS OPPOSITION BY A TRIBE THEN. THAT ELIMINATES THE OPTION OF THE STREAMLINING SO I'M. DEFENDER MARLON I'M CURIOUS MISTER SURE HOW WE RESOLVED THIS. ISSUE MOST OF US ARE JUST TRYING TO. THANK YOU RECORD OUT THERE WE'RE WE'RE WORKING REALLY REALLY HARD TO RESOLVE THE AND I'LL MAKE SOME MORE COMMENTS ABOUT THAT- AFTER OTHER MEMBERS HAVE COMMENTED TOPIC THAT IS AN ISSUE WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON- WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO RESOLVE. MORE THAN I WILL JUST PATIENTLY WAIT THANK YOU MISTER JENKINS FRAZIER BUSINESS ON CHECK IN MY MEMORY SOMEONE IS CONTINUE SHE HAD ASSEMBLY TO COMMENT YES ABOUT THE THIS GROUND THOUGH IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO- THINKING I MAKE IN ADDITION. HI AT. AND THIS IS LAURA MARIA AND GUIDED THE PER SE THREE FOR TRIBAL INVOLVED. AND THE TRIBAL SCOPING CONSULTATION THAT IS CREATED BECAUSE- THERE CAN THEY'RE AND NOT AS A WAY TO IDENTIFY. IF THERE ARE TRIBAL RESOURCES ON ON THE PROPERTY AND WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW SIGNIFICANT THEY MIGHT BE SO THAT IS ALREADY IN ONE SIXTY EIGHT AT THIS TIME AND IS THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WHY. THE DEVELOPING CONSULTATION WAS PLACED INTO THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MILLER ON ANY ADDITIONAL. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON YOUR DATA CENTER BATES AND THEN WE'LL GO TO CENTER THERE ALSO OKAY SO I'M JUST A CLARIFICATION BECAUSE THE MOTION THAT AS MADE BY OUR SENATOR Y. KASKI IS TO MOVE IT TO THE FULL. COULD YOU EXT PROCESS SINCE I THINK MOST OF US CAN SAY MOST OF THE LOBBY IN PARTICULAR WAITING TO HEAR SOME RESOLUTION ON UNDER APPEAL PROCESS OF SOME FASHION YEAH AND I I'M ASSUMING THAT'S WAS GOING TO BE WORKED ON. YEAH CENTER BATES- SO BECAUSE THIS BILL- THIS HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THIS COMMITTEEUNDER SENATE RULE TWENTY NINE TEN- BE BECAUSE IT WAS PREVIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS IS COMMITTEE PASTOR WITH MY SUPPORT. LAST YEAR WONDER GOING FINANCE- AND THEN THROUGH THE APPROPRIATIONS. COMMITTEE MAYBE EVEN YOU TO AS WELL I CAN'T REMEMBER CENTER A LOT OF COMMITTEES AND- IT WAS ON THE FLOOR AND THEN THE AUTHOR OF WHICH IS HER PROVOCATIVE. MADE SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS ON THE FLOOR IT BECAME A TO YOUR BILL IT WAS REFERRED BACK UNDER RULE TWENTY NINE TEN B. THAT MEANS THAT. WE CANNOT AMEND THE BILL IN COMMITTEE WE CAN OBTAIN AGREEMENTS TO AMENDED ON THE FLOOR. IT ALSO DOES NOT HAVE TO RISK. RELATIONS COMMITTEE SO OUR OPTIONS TODAY ARE TO HOLD THANK YOU PASS IT TO THE FLOOR. AS I WILL STATE AT THE END. ALL THE MOTION WHAT THE THAT SO MEMBER I RECORD CENTER MCGUIRE AND I ARE GOING TO SPEND ENERGY PARTNERS ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- AND I'M JUST AND I'M CONFIDENT HOW TO BUILD OVERALL GONNA RALLY AND GET BEHIND TO GET PAST HI YES THE ISSUE OF LEGAL RECOURSE IS I WILL BE SHORTLY IS ONE THAT IS ON MY MIND- AND IT'S ONE THAT- I BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESOLVE. PRESIDENT OF THE BUS SENATOR. THE DID GO THROUGH HERE. OKAY MMHM SENATORS ARE ALSO. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE MCGUIRE AND THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY I LOVE THESE WORDS A MISTAKE SHOULD NOT DEFINE AS HOW WE WORK TO FIX IT DOES AND- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR THIS ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU CENTER BY SENATOR ROTH. JUST OF THE COMMENTED A QUESTION CHAIR YOU KNOW I'VE- I. BELIEVE I ASK A QUESTION I'M NOT SURE I HAVE AN ANSWER YET THE BILL UTILIZES THE TERM POTENTIAL TROUBLE CULTURAL RESOURCE AND FOR EXAMPLE ND- REMEMBER WHAT. SUBSECTION THIS IS IT'S- FOR SECTION SEES SO IT'S IS IT IF BURKE PERMISSION TO REACH THE BILL MISTER. AFTER THE SCOPING CONSUL THE PARTY'S FINE TODAY POTENTIAL TROUBLE CULTURAL RESEARCH RESOURCE COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT. AND ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT IS NOT DOCUMENTED BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE IN THE LOCAL. GOVERNMENT REGARDING METHODS A TUTOR TO RETURN OF THE DEVELOPMENT SHALL NOT BE ELIGIBLE. FOR THE STREAMLINED MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS THIS IS MY QUESTION I GUESS IS THIS WHAT WHAT THE POTENTIAL TROUBLE CULTURAL RESOURCE IS NOT DEFINED. AS THAT MEAN WE THINK THERE IS ONE. WE'RE SPECULATING THAT THERE'S ONE OR THAT THERE IS A TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCE THAT COULD BE AFFECTED. AND THAT'S WHY. THE ACTION IS NOT TAKEN OR THE ACTIONS TAKEN. I WOULD PASSED THE GIVE THE AUTHOR BRAXTON'S BROWN THE TO. ON TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE COULD YOU POINT OF CLARIFICATION ON THAT PLEASE. WHAT I LIKE TO CLARIFY. OKAY YES. AROUND THE I'M SORRY TO KEEP. PUTTING YOU BACK IN BUT YOUR EXCELLENT ANSWER QUESTION SO IF YOU COULD- PROCESSED CENTER QUESTION. HELLO YES WE HEAR. SO NORMALLY DURING THE CONSUL PROCESS THE GOAL IS TO FIND OUT WHAT ATTENTION OF CULTURAL RESOURCES AND CULTURAL RESOURCES EXISTING AND POTENTIAL IS ABOUT. IDENTIFYING CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY INDICATE A RESOURCE UNDERGROUND A LOT OF THESE RESOURCES ARE NOT CLEARLY VISIBLE WHEN YOU ARE FIRST LOOKING AT DOING CERTAIN TEST EXCAVATIONS OR WHATNOT AND SOMETIMES ONLY A PARTIAL CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND- SO IT'S TAGGING THAT THERE'S THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE IS A CULTURAL RESOURCE WE MAY NOT KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF IT BUT WE'RE GOING TO AN AGREEMENT. TO CONCEPTS TERMS TO ADDRESS BOTH THE ACTUAL RESTORED AND WHAT MIGHT POTENTIALLY COME UP LIKE THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TERRIBLE MONITORS DURING GRADING BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THEY'RE STILL. MAYBE THINGS ON THE GROUND. THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BY SEEING NINE- I'M GOING TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS BUT I DO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT ARE THERE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OR SEVERAL BECAUSE AND I MEAN SOME OF THEM THE AUTHORS AGREE TO SOME SHE HAS NOT AGREED TO THOSE ONE WHERE THERE'S AN AGREEMENT CONCEPT OF WE'RE GONNA WORK OUT- SOME OF THE DETAILS. FOR THE PROCESS SO- COLLEAGUES AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT. IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT BILL. I'M FRANKLY THAT'S WHY. WE'VE TAKEN AS MUCH TIME AS A TAKEN OVER THE LAST YEAR. TO WORK ON IT IF THIS WERE NOT. A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BILL. IN TERMS OF WHAT IT PER TAX- WE WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN. THAT AMOUNT OF TIME. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY HOUSING COMMITTEE SUFFERS FROM MORE TIME OVER THE LAST YEAR ON THIS BUILDING OR ANY OTHER BILLS. AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE. THIS MATTER IS. PROTECTING TRIBAL RESOURCES MUST BE A HIGH PRIORITY. AND WE NEED TO GET IT RIGHT. AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT IS A LANDMARK BILL. BECAUSE SB THIRTY FIVE IS NOT THE ONLY STREAMLINING BILL. THIS IS A LANDMARK IMPORTANT PRESIDENTIAL CRITICAL BILL. IT HAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT GOAL OF PROTECTING TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES SO MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH OF COURSE AS HE WON SIXTY EIGHT AMENDS IS A LANDMARK HOUSING LOSS SET IS CURRENTLY AS WE SPEAK STREAMLINING APPROVAL OF MANY THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF HOUSING MANY HOMES. OVERWHELMINGLY HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING IN MY HOME CITY SEVERAL THOUSAND ALONE SYSTEM ONE CITY. AND INCLUDING IN CITIES THAT HAVE NEVER BEFORE ALLOW LOW INCOME HOUSING TO BE BUILT. IN THERE ARE COMMUNITIES TOPPING BECAUSE OF SB THIRTY FIVE. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR BOTH UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT PRIORITIES. TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES REFLECT THE CULTURE BUT PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED GENOCIDE AT THE HANDS OF COLONIZERS AND WE NEED TO CALL THIS FOR WHAT IT IS GENOCIDE EXTERMINATION. AT THE HANDS O COLONIZERS COLONIZERS WHO ATTEMPTED TO A RACE AND- GLITTERY THEIR CULTURE ENTIRELY. CALIFORNIA HAS EMBRACED PROTECTION OF THESE CULTURAL RESOURCES THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT WE KNOW THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR STATE. AND AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT IS AN ADDITIONAL STRONG STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA FACES A DRAMATIC AND DESTRUCTIVE HOUSING CRISIS DUE IN PART. TO HELP LONG IT TAKES TO GET HOUSING APPROVED TWO THREE FOUR FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS. TO GET HOUSING APPROVED. WE'RE SHORT MILLIONS OF HOMES IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. TWO TWO ARE SEVERE HOUSING SHORTAGE PEOPLE ARE BEING DISPLACED. FOR BEING PUSHED INTO POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN INTENSELY OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS WHICH IS WHY WE ARE SEEING CERTAIN COMMUNITIES BEING SO HORRIBLY IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO LIVE HOURS FROM WHERE THEY WORK SO THAT THEY HAVE TO SPEND FOUR HOURS A DAY IN A CAR. GETTING DIABETES HEART IN A BOX NOT SEEING THEIR CHILDREN DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT. PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA ENTIRELY. CALIFORNIA HAS 13% OF THE NATION'S POPULATION YET WE HAVE TWENTY 5% OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS AND 53% OF THE NATION'S UNSHELTERED HOMELESS THAT IS A MORAL FAILURE IN EXTREME. AND THE DESTRUCTION OF TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES IT IS A MORAL FAILURE IN THE EXTREME. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT TO SHOW WHAT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. THAT TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES AND HOUSING ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IT SHOULD NOT BE PITTED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER THESE ARE TOO HIGH HIGH PRIORITIES. THAT WE CAN ADVANCE BOTH. AND WE CAN HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR HOUSING AND WE CAN EMBRACE AND PRESERVE THE CULTURE THAT REMAINS AND THE RESOURCES THAT REMAIN FOR OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. WHEN I SB THIRTY FIVE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROCESS OF SB THIRTY FIVE I WAS THE AUTHOR OF THAT BILL IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT WAS ONE OF THE CENTERPIECES OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. LEGISLATIVE HOUSING PACKAGE THE GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED. THAT BILL. EVERY I'VE ALL I'VE INTRODUCED FORTY PIECES OF LEGISLATION SINCE I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE TO LEGISLATIVE SOCCER SEASON EIGHTY EIGHTY PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO LEGISLATIVE CYCLES NO LEGISLATION THAT I HAVE AUTHORED HAS RECEIVED MORE TECHNICAL AND LEGAL SCRUTINY AND SENATE BILL THIRTY FIVE HE WAS INTENSIVELY SCRUTINISED BY SIX DIFFERENT COMMITTEES INCLUDING THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION HOUSING COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY SENATOR ABOUT THE SENATE THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY SENATOR MCGUIRE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY SENATOR LARA. THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY SOMEONE TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR CURRY THE SENATE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY THE RUNNER GONZALEZ COMMITTEES WITH STRONG CHAIRS. WITH BRILLIANT STAFF. AND NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THESE CAN. IDENTIFIED THIS SHOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL EXEMPTION THAT WAS AN INSTITUTIONAL FAILINGS COLLECTIVE FAILURE BY ALL OF US AND I AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THAT WE HAVE TO OWN THAT. AND WE HAVE TO FIX IT I WILL ALSO SAY THAT ARE NOT BILL MANY MANY MANY ADVOCATES LOBBYISTS APPROACH US. WITH FEEDBACK AND IDEAS THE BILL. NOT A SINGLE LOBBYIST CAME FORWARD AND SAID HEY YOU MISSED PUTTING. TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES AND AS AN EXEMPTION. AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF LOBBYISTS IN THIS COMMUNITY WHO FOCUS ON THAT IS NOT A SINGLE ONE APPEARS TO HAVE CAUGHT IT THIS WAS A COLLECTIVE FAILURE. AND WE MUST FIX IT. AS I MENTIONED SB THIRTY FIVE. FRANKLY SHOULD BE SINGLED OUT THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF THIS BILL. BUT THIS ISN'T AS SB THIRTY FIVE WE HAVE MANY STREAMLINING BILL'S GOING BACK TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THIS BUILDING. I THINK. STREAMLINING BILLS THAT TAKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROJECTS OUT OF SEQUENCE. WE HAVE STREAMLINING LAWS. THAT HAVE REMOVED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. FROM SEQUENCE STREAMLINING LAWS THAT ARE REMOVED HOMELESS SHELTERS FOR NAVIGATION CENTERS FROM SEACROFT. AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THIS IS A BROADER. ISSUE IT'S NOT ABOUT ONE BILL. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER SPONSORS FOR WORKING. WITH THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE WORK TO DO AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED. THE WAY THE BILL IS STRUCTURED NOW. THERE IS NO LEGAL RECOURSE IF SOMEONE DISAGREES WITH THE DECISION. THERE IS NINE. WITH EVERY OTHER SB THIRTY FIVE EXEMPTS AND THERE IS LEGAL RECOURSE IF THE CITY DECIDES THAT THIS IS A HISTORIC RESOURCE FOR ITS ON A CERTAIN FLOOD MAP AND YOU DISAGREE YOU CAN SET UP A LEGAL REMEDY. TO CONTEST THAT. BUT NINE IN EIGHTY ONE SIXTY EIGHT. THAT IS THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE WORKING FOR. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE CIVIL COURT SYSTEM I KNOW. THAT THE TRIBES HAVE VERY WELL EARNS TO SUSPICION. THE CIVIL COURT SYSTEM AND I'M NOT BEEN TREATED THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE AND OUR CIVIL COURTS. AND SO WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE. ABOUT HOW WE GET TO A SYSTEM WHERE THERE IS SOME SORT OF RECOURSE IF SOMEONE BELIEVES THE LAW HAS BEEN VIOLATED. THAT IS SO FUNDAMENTAL. TO OUR LAWS AND TO BASIC FAIRNESS THAT IF YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE A LEGAL ENTITLEMENT AND HAS BEEN VIOLATED. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BE WRONG. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF LEGAL RECOURSE. I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER SPONSORS. FOR DEVOTING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME. MISTER AND I MISS COYLE WERE TWO OF THE- HAREDI GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE WE'VE BEEN MEETING FOR A YEAR WORKING TOGETHER BUT THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THEM. FOR PUTTING SO MUCH ENERGY INTO THIS SOMEWHAT FOR WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE. I WANT TO PARTICULARLY THANK HOUSING SOUTH. OF FOR PUTTING ENDLESS HOURS AND- TO WORK ON THIS DAY- HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB. AS I SAID. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY POOR BILL IT HAS TO HAPPEN WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. I WILL SUPPORT- THE MOTION TODAY TO MOVE THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE TO THE SENATE FLOOR. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WILL WORK OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS TO FIND AN AGREEABLE SOLUTION- RELATING TO THE RE OF THE PARTIES. ARE IN AGREEMENT. ADELE THE TRY CULTURAL RESOURCE DETERMINATION. SO I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY ON CENTER Y. CALYCES MOTION. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THE COMING WEEKS WHAT THE AUTHOR. CENTER MCGUIRE WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY AND OTHERS. AND THIS BILL WILL NOT BE TAKEN UP ON THE SENATE FLOOR. UNLESS WE HAVE. A CONSENSUS AMONG MYSELF CENTER MCGUIRE OF THE AUTHOR. AND OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS A CONSENSUS WHICH I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL REACH. WE WILL PASS AN EXCELLENT. THE BILL TO PROTECT THESE RESOURCES. SO WITH THAT I AM RECOMMENDING.

ALL SIDES HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY ON AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS PAST MONTHS. AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHAIR AND CENTER MCGUIRE. I'M WILLING TO COMMIT MORE TIME TO DISCUSSION OF ALTERNATIVES ON WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IN THE END AGREEMENT CANNOT BE REACHED AFTER A SCOPING CONSULTATION. UNDER AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT. ALTHOUGH THE IS COMPREHENSIVE AND REFLECTS ALMOST TWO YEARS OF STAKEHOLDERS WORK WE MUST ENGAGE WITH TRIBAL LEADERS AND OUR TRIBAL COALITION TO DISCUSS. POTENTIAL OPTIONS. IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE TIME TO EXPLORE THESE OPTIONS I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY. AND I WILL COMMIT TO YOU TO DO EVERYTHING Y POWER TO REACH AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN CHAIRPERSON. WIENER SENATOR MCGUIRE AND MYSELF IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. IN THE END I HOPE YOU WILL AGREE THE PROTECTION OF INDIGENOUS CULTURE RESOURCES.
