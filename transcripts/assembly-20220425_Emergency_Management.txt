OKAY THAT MOTION IS OUT ASSEMBLY WE DO HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM HERE- PHOTO NUMBER FOUR TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOW. SO WHEN YOU ARE READY SIR THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO BE PRESENTING AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE WHICH MAKES IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE ELDER CALIFORNIA PIPELINE SAFETY ACT. OF NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE. THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT ALL INTRASTATE PIPELINES ARE REGULARLY INSPECTED AND SAFELY OPERATED. CALIFORNIA OF COURSE HAS WORKED HARD TO ESTABLISH A MEANINGFUL AND EFFECTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT ENSURES PIPELINE SAFETY WHILE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION CONTINUES IN THE STATE. THE ELDER CALIFORNIA PIPELINE SAFETY ACT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS FRAMEWORK THE ACT DEFINES PIPELINE TO INCLUDE. EVERY INTERSTATE PIPELINE USED FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS LIQUID SUBSTANCES OR HIGHLY VOLATILE LIQUID SUBSTANCE AS SPECIFIED HOWEVER THE ACT EXCLUDES A PIPELINE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL THAT OPERATES. BAG GRAVITY OR TO STRESS LEVEL THAT IS LESS THAN TWENTY PERCENT. OR LESS OF THE SPECIFIED MINIMUM YIELD STRENGTH OF THE PIPE. UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF USE THIS EXCLUSION AS A LOOPHOLE TO CIRCUMVENT COMPLIANCE WITH STATE REGULATION WHICH MEANS THAT- ESSENTIAL SAFETY MEASURES SUCH AS INSPECTIONS AND TESTING THAT ENSURE THE INTEGRITY AND SAFE OPERATION OF PIPELINES ARE NOT MET. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE WILL CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE BY REQUIRING INSPECTION FOR ALL INTERSTATE PIPELINES WHETHER THEY'RE OPERATING AT FULL OR PARTIAL PRESSURE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- THESE ANNUAL ONEROUS BUT THEY'RE CRITICAL FOR ALL PARTIES TO AVOID DAMAGE AND LOSSES FROM OIL SPILLS. THIS BILL ALSO CLARIFIES THAT PIPELINE OPERATORS MUST KEEP RECORDS IN A USABLE AND READABLE FORM. AND PROVIDE THAT THOSE WORK AND PROVIDE THOSE RECORDS UPON REQUEST BY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. AGAIN THIS WILL ALLOW STATE REGULATORS TO SAFEGUARD PIPELINE OPERATIONS AND PROTECT THE STATE COMMUNITIES THE ENVIRONMENT AND ULTIMATELY THE INTEGRITY OF THE INDUSTRY ITSELF IN THE WAKE OF LAST YEAR'S ORANGE COUNTY SPILL THIS BILL IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO HELP ENSURE THAT ALL STATE REGULATED PIPELINES. ARE REGULARLY INSPECTED AND MAINTAINED SO THAT DAMAGE TO A PIPELINE DOES NOT LEAD TO YET ANOTHER CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME. IS TO BE JOINED BY MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA WITH CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. OKAY MISS ALL ROMERO MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLAME IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE. WHICH IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT ALL INTERSTATE PIPELINES ARE REGULARLY INSPECTED AND MAINTAINED WHILE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION CONTINUES IN THE STATE. THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL REGULATES THE SAFETY OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF INTERSTATE HAZARDOUS LIQUID TRANSPORTATION PIPELINES AND ACTS AS AN AGENT OF THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY. CONCERNING THE INSPECTION OF MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND MILES OF INTERSTATE PIPELINES. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO EXCLUDE ANY PIPELINE IT'S TRANSPORTING HAZARDOUS LIQUID SUBSTANCE IN OUR STATE FROM REGULAR INSPECTIONS AND TESTING. EACH ONE HAS HAD A CATHOLIC HAS HAD A CATASTROPHIC RISK TO ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY IF THEY ARE NOT PROPERLY MAINTAINED. OUR STATE'S HISTORY OF OIL SPILLS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF DEMONSTRATING. UP FROM THIS POINT FROM THE SANTA BARBARA OIL SPILL IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE TO OF COURSE THE OIL SPILL FROM LAST YEAR AND ORANGE COUNTY. EACH ONE HAS HAD A CATASTROPHIC IMPACT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES WILDLIFE- AND THIS THESE EVENTS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS. NOT A FAIL SAFE WAY TO EXTRACT AND TRANSPORT OIL BUT REGULAR INSPECTIONS AND PROPER MAINTENANCE OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS ESSENTIAL TO MINIMIZING THE RISK FUTURE OIL SPILLS. AND ASA FAMILY MEMBER BLOOM NOTED THESE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS ARE NOT EXCESSIVELY ONEROUS THEREFORE REQUIRING ALL INTERSTATE PIPELINES TO BE REGULATED. REGARDLESS OF OPERATING PRESSURE IS SENSIBLE FROM BOTH AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND INDUSTRY STANDPOINT. AND IS CRITICAL FOR ALL PARTIES TO AVOID DAMAGE AND LOSSES FROM OIL SPILLS. SERVER THESE REASONS CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS IS IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE. AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH.

WHEN YOU'RE READY RUSSIA. THANK YOU ARE A WHEELCHAIR I AM HERE PRESENT AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. SO UNDER CURRENT LAW THE CALIFORNIA REGENCY SERVICES ACT AUTHORIZES THE GOVERNOR TO SUSPEND ANY REGULATION OR STATUTE DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY. THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY POWERS ALSO GRANT THE ABILITY TO SUSPEND ANY LOCAL REGULATION OR LAW. ALL THESE POWERS ARE AUTHORIZED UPON THE DECLARATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND REMAIN IN EFFECT THROUGH THE END OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY EMERGENCY POWERS EXIST IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE STATE TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. TO AN IMMINENT CRISIS. CONSEQUENTLY HAS BEEN A LONG HELD ASSUMPTION THE EMERGENCY POWERS WILL ONLY BE EXERCISED TO RESPOND TO CONDITIONS RELATING TO THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY. HOWEVER AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT LIMIT EMERGENCY POWERS TO THAT END. THE LAW IN ITS EXISTING STE STATE AUTHORIZES THE POWERS PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED SIMPLY UNDER THE CONDITION THAT A STATE OF EMERGENCY EXISTS. EVEN IF THOSE POWERS ARE EXERCISED TO RESPOND TO AN UNRELATED ISSUES OR CONDITIONS. THEY'RE CURRENTLY TWENTY FIVE OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY RANGING FROM NEW YORK TO ALASKA THEY HAVE STATUTES SPECIFYING THAT EMERGENCY POWERS MUST BE USED TO RESPONSE BUT CIVICALLY TO CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE EMERGENCY. AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD JOIN CALIFORNIA WITH THESE THOSE STATES IN MAINTAINING THEIR CLEAR GUIDANCE UNDER EMERGENCY POWERS STATUTE BY CODIFYING THE ASSUMPTION THAT EMERGENCY POWERS ARE AUTHORIZED ONLY IN THE SCOPE AS THEY RELATE TO THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS OF THE EMERGENCY. AND THIS IS JUST SIMPLY A GOOD GOVERNANCE TYPE BILL THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE- THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

WALDRON WARD. SIX PLEA BUT OPEN ALL RIGHT WILL CONTINUE HAVE THE ROLLOVER FOR ANY MISSING MEMBERS SO THE NEXT ONE ON IS FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO AGUIAR-CURRY. WHEN YOU'RE READY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OKAY. SELECTION OF FISH WITH THE REGULAR. ALL RIGHT GOTIT. ALL RIGHT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBER I'M HERE TODAY TO A TWENTY FIFTY WHICH REQUIRES THE PUMP UTILITY COMMISSION TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON BROADWAY SERVICE EFFORTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER EMERGENCIES OR DISASTERS. YOU KNOW THE WILDFIRES OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CAUSED MASSIVE DEVASTATION FOR PROPERTY LOSS TO LOSS OF TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS DAMAGE. MANY PEOPLE REPORT THAT THEIR MOBILE PHONES WENT DARK AND INTERNET SERVICE WHEN OUT OF CELL TIME TOWERS WERE DAMAGED AN UNDERGROUND FIBER LINES WERE BURNED. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AN ONLINE SURVEY FOUND THAT 64% OF RESPONDENTS IN THE CINEMA COUNTY AS WELL FAR. AFFECTED THEIR LOST HIM LAND LINE PHONE SERVICE. IN TWENTY TWENTY THE GAS FIRE. GET I CLASSIFIER REPORTED DAMAGE ATTEMPT TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE CAUSING DISRUPTIONS IN PHONE SERVICE IN THE AFFECTED AREA. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THESE DEVASTATING FIRES THE STATE THE PC HAVE FOR FOCUS HEAVILY ON THE UTILITIES RESPONSE TO THE MASS OF DESTRUCTION. EVEN TODAY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE FULL IMPACT OF THESE NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE HAD ON OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND HOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES HAVE RESPONDED. CONCRETE RECOVERY PLANS ARE NOT SHARED WITH THE PC. OR THE LEGISLATURE WHOSE JOB IS TO OVERSEE THESE COMPANIES AND TO REPRESENT THE PUBLIC INTEREST. WE NEED THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE GOVERNMENTS ARE HELPING IN THIS REPAIR EFFORTS AND NOT IMPEDINGTHE RESTORATION. AB TWELVE TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO REQUIRES THE PC TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS EFFORTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACE THAT NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. AFTER THE EMERGENCIES OR DISASTERS. I WANT TO STRESS THAT THE BILL'S REQUIRED REPORTING IS NOT MANDATED TO BE SUBMITTED DURING THE EMERGENCIES THEMSELVES BUT IS INSTEAD A LOOK BACK TO MAKE SURE GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS IN THE SHORT TERM. DURING EMERGENCIES AN APPROPRIATE SERVICE TO SUPPORT LOCAL ECONOMIES AFTER DOES THE DISASTER IN THE LONG TERM. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT STATE REGULATORS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE INFORMED OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE FAILURES. AND NETWORK DAMAGE AFTER DISASTER NATURAL DISASTER. WITHOUT INFORMATION REGARDING THE METHODS AND THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO REBUILD THERE'S NO WAY TO ENSURE THE RESIDENTS HAVE THE SAME OR IMPROVED ACCESS TO RELIABLE NETWORK. FOR THE FOR MOST CALIFORNIANS RELIABLE VOICE TELEPHONE SERVICES NECESSARY TO REACH NINE ONE ONE WITHOUT IT THE ABILITY TO CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES LIMITED OR NON EXISTENT ANSWERING QUESTIONS ARE FRANK ERRORS SAY. MAN RIGHT. AND REGINA COSTA A RETURN TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY DIRECTOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU WITH THAT- WHO LIKE TO GO FIRST FRANK WOOD YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS FRANK I DON'T SEE IT BUT IT'S THE TOUGHEST FOUR LETTERS IN TH WORLD. ITSELF IT'S NO GOOD I AM EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT NINE WE ARE CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO. DISTRICT NINE COVERS CALIFORNIA NEVADA AND HAWAII AND WE REPRESENT THE WORKERS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY'S AND ABORTS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF OTHER INDUSTRIES WE ASK THAT YOU PASS A. B. TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO TO ENSURE THAT OUR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IS FULLY AND PROPERLY RESTORED FOLLOWING A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY. CW A MEMBERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE SENT OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WHERE THE B. URBAN OR RURAL TO RESTORE SERVICE AND REBUILD CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WHEN THERE IS DAMAGE CAUSED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF EVENTS. OUR MEMBERS AND WORKERS ARE THE ONES TRYING TO GET FAMILIES BACK ONLINE AND BACK CONNECTED. OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY HOME EVERY INTERNET CONNECTION IS BACK UP AND BACK IN THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE. AND IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS POSSIBLE FOR LONG TERM SERVICE TO STAYING ABILITY. INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BEEN SEEN THERE BROADBAND SERVICE INTERRUPTED BECAUSE OF EMERGENCY LIKE DURING THE AFOREMENTIONED GLASS FIRED CINEMA COUNTY IN TWENTY TWENTY. OUR WORKERS ARE OFTEN THE ONES HEARING FROM CUSTOMERS ABOUT THESE KINDS OF SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS. WE BELIEVE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT IS NEEDED TO ENSURE PROPER PROPER SERVICE RESTORATION. TEMPORARY MEASURES DEPLOYED AFTER THE FACT FOLLOWING A DISASTER ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. FOR EXAMPLE DRONES AND MOBILE TOWERS ON TRUCKS PROVIDE ONLY LIMITED. TEMPORARY RESTORATION NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR REAL CONNECTIVITY. WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE RESTORED FOR EVERY CUT. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO WILL LAY GROUNDWORK TO ADDRESS HOW PROVIDERS REBUILD WHOLE COMMUNITIES AFTER DISASTERS. ARE THEY INSTALLING UPGRADES WHENEVER POSSIBLE. OR ARE THEY JUST DOING THE BARE MINIMUM LEAVING THE NETWORK OUTDATED AND UNABLE TO BE TODAY'S AND TOMORROW'S NEEDS WE OWE IT TO THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE WILD FARMS AND TO RESTORE OUR ABILITY TO HOLD PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO TAKES IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR NEXT ORIGINAL. THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY. I'M REGION ACOSTA SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK A CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO. DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS THE IMPORTANCE A RELIABLE TELECOM AND BROADBAND SERVICE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO SHARP RELIEF BY BOTH THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND THE MANY DECLARED DISASTERS EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. RELIABLE BROADBAND DURING DISASTERS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE SEEKING INFORMATION DURING EMERGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE TO REACH WEBSITE SUCH AS ALERT WILDFIRE DOT ORG. LAST YEAR THE CPUC REQUIRED TELECOM SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT DAMAGE TO INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS BY DECLARED DISASTERS. INCLUDING THE DAMAGE AND THE STEPS TAKEN TO REPAIR OR REBUILD INFRASTRUCTURE. THE C. P. U. C. ACTION ADDRESS MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE PRIOR BILL AB ELEVEN HUNDRED. BUT THE CPUC ACTION DID NOT COVER BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO ADDRESSES THAT BY REQUIRING THE CPUC TO ALSO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT DAMAGE ROOF- AND REBUILDING OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE RESULTING FROM A DECLARED DISASTER. FOR ALL BROADBAND PROVIDERS THE BILL HAS THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT THE CPC REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. WHILE FOLLOWING THE CPC'S EXISTING PROCEDURES RELATING TO THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. THERE IS- OTHER DATA. UNDERTAKEN BY CAL- YES ABOUT TELECOM SERVICE OUTAGES IN REAL TIME TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF EMERGENCY OFFICIALS THE ACTION REQUIRED BY AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO SERVES A DIFFERENT PURPOSE. THE REPORT WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMISSION WITH A LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE ON THE RELIABILITY OF BROADBAND FOR ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. TO HELP INSURE THAT NO COMMUNITY IS LEFT BEHIND WE WERE SPLIT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. DANIEL GUTIERREZ ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SAM NUNN. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM FOR OPPOSITION FOR. CAN I GET. RIVAS RIGHT. WITH YOUR TERM CHRIS BERNIER OSCAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION- VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE BUT WE ARE IN OPPOSITION AND WE WERE IN OPPOSITION FOR NUMBER REASONS SO FIRST OF ALL WE AGREE WE AGREE WITH THE FIRES THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY WERE HORRIBLE THEY DESTROYED OUR NETWORKS WE HAD ON FIBER UNDERGROUND IN LAKE COUNTY THAT MELTED SO- THIS THE FARMERS WERE HORRIBLE. BUT WE RESTORED AND THEY WERE ALL RESTORED A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED SO HOPEFULLY FOLKS ROUND TABLE WILL LEARN THE SAME LESSONS. FIRST OF ALL. SIR MCGUIRE HAD LEGISLATION SB SIX SEVENTY IN A SENIOR NOW SAYS. SB SIX SEVENTY SAYS THAT WE MUST AS COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS WE MUST. SHARE IT WITH CAL OH YES. INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT WAS DESTROYED HOW LONG IS IT TAKING TO BE DESTROYED WHEN WILL BE BACK UP AND RUNNING AND WHEN IS UP AND RUNNING. THAT IS INFORMATION ONLY SHARED WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRST RESPONDERS BECAUSE IT IS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ADDITION TO THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. D. P. YOU SEE ADOPTED RESILIENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR WIRELESS INDUSTRY SO YOU HEARD ABOUT THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK GOING DOWN. AND WE AND WE GOT THAT AND WE LEARNED A LESSON FROM THAT AND THE P. SHE MADE A DECISION. ADOPTED NEW ZEALAND- RULES FOR RESTORATION. THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THE PC FINALLY ADOPTED. SIMILAR RESILIENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR WIRED COMMUNICATIONS IN ADDITION TO THAT WE MUST HAVE BACKUP POWER FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS. TO MAKE SURE THOSE COMMUNICATIONS ARE UP AND RUNNING DURING- DISASTERS DURING PS PS. AND WHATNOT SO WE HAVE DONE A LOT NOW IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR FOLKS SAY WELL. THAT THOSE RULES AND THAT LEGISLATION WAS TIED TO COMMUNICATIONS IT WASN'T TIED TO BROADBAND. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A REAL SHOCK TO- COMMITTEE IT'S THE SAME NETWORK SO THAT WAY IF IT GOES OUT OF THE VOICE GOES OUT. ROBIN GOES OUT YOUR TELEMEDICINE GOES OUT. YOUR VOICE COMMUNICATIONS YOUR VIDEO SERVICE SO IT ALL GOES OUT IT IS THE SAME NETWORK IT IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME NETWORK THAT GOES OUT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES KNOW IT ASKS FOR DIFFERENT TYPE OF INFORMATION AND WHAT IS GIVEN TO CAL OH YES AND CAL OH YES IT IS ABOUT. THE SERVICE WHAT IS THE SERVICE AND ALL THE SERVICES ARE HONORED TO BROADBAND VOICE AND VIDEO. COMMUNICATIONS THIS BILL WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT TECHNOLOGY SORT OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SO WHEN YOU RESTORED WHAT DID YOU RESTART WITH WELL WHO'S ASKING WOULD YOU WANT TO KNOW SO IS SERVE SOME PURPOSE TO THAT. OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE. COMMUNICATION SERVICES THE BROADBAND SERVICES IT IS NOT TO GET INTO WHAT. THE DEVICES WE ARE USING. NOW I KNOW THEY SAY IN THIS BILL THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION IN REAL TIME WELL GUESS WHAT YOU HAVE TO COLLECTED IN REAL TIME. EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T GIVE IT TO YOU RIGHT AWAY. YOU STILL HAVE TO COLLECTED IN REAL TIME SO. THAT'S A DISTRACTION WE'RE TRYING TO GET NETWORKS UP AND RUNNING. THEN TO SAY A BUT WE KNOW WE GOT TO GET THIS FOR. THE PC THEY'RE GONNA WANT THIS BUT THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU IN AN ANNUAL REPORT NOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WITH THAT I'M NOT SURE. IT SOUNDS LIKE. IF THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT RESTORATION EFFORTS. YOU WOULD THINK THAT THERE'S SOME PRECEDENT SOMEWHERE SO. IN THEIR PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS BILL. WE'VE ASKED FOR IF THERE'S A PROBLEM SOMEWHERE IF THERE'S A COMMUNITY SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE WAS NOT PROPER RESTORATION. PLEASE LET ME KNOW. TELL ME WHERE THAT COMMUNITY WHAT'S- IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC COMMUNITY THAT WAS NOT RESTORED. TO ITS FULL EXTENT OR BETTER. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. SO MAYBE RATHER THAN. REQUIRING A REPORT MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST WANT TO DO A STUDY MAYBE JUST GO BACK AND- YOU KNOW YOU. THE INCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED. THIS IS TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS FIVE YEARS AGO. SO IF YOU WANT TO DO A LOOK BACK I HEARD THAT. THE PHRASE LOOK BACK I'M AN EX AUDITOR GENERAL. STAFF SO I WAS AN AUDITOR FOR THREE AND HALF YEARS. AND I LOVE ON ITS I LOVE GOING BACK I LOVE YOU'RE FINE OU KNOW WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED SINCE THE INITIAL INCIDENT HAS OCCURRED. TO RATHER THAN ASSUME THAT. SOMETHING IS AMISS. MAYBE WE SHOULD CONFIRM THAT IT IS A MESS SO. UNTIL WE HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REASON WHY- WE WOULD OPPOSE THIS MEASURE. IF IT WERE CONSISTENT WITH INFORMATION PROVIDED BY CALLOVIAN ASPECTS MAYBE INFORMATION COULD BE SHARED BUT IT'S DIFFERENT. AGAIN WHY THE TECHNOLOGY WHAT WHO WHO'S ASKING WHY DO YOU WANT. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. I THANK YOU- ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION YES. YOUR LONG THE BENSON WITH US TELECOM WE ARE. REPRESENTATIVE OF CALIFORNIA FACILITY BASED. WIRE LINE. TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND BROUGHT PROVIDER- BELIEVE THAT. WE HAPPENED. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY TWO DOES IS ACTUALLY. OUTSIDE OF THE PURVIEW OF THE PC AS FAR AS- ITS LEGAL AUTHORITY. TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S BEYOND THEIR JURISDICTION BECAUSE BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE NOT PUBLIC. UTILITIES AS IS CURRENTLY WHY THE PC CAN COLLECT INFORMATION SUCH AS THIS. AND AS MENTIONED AS BERNIE MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THE PC ALREADY REQUIRES DISASTER IN PLAN RESTORATION INFORMATION TO BE FILED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FCC. ALSO HAS AN OPENING. UP AN OPEN PROCEEDING RIGHT NOW REGARDING NETWORK RESILIENCY AND NETWORK OUTAGE REPORTING WE BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE CALIFORNIA'S PACIFIC WOULD BE IN DIRECT CONFLICT. WITH POTENTIAL THE POTENTIAL FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT WILL BE COMING OUT. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWO AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM OPPOSITION. SEE NON WILL BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHAIR SIR TELL YOU HAVE A COMMENT QUESTION YES THEY DO- SO BEFORE AND IT SENT SOME OF IT WAS RELATED TO THE INFORMATION GOING OUT IMMEDIATELY AND YOU KIND OF ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE BIT HERE. BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS IT BEING THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE WERE TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PART AND WE'RE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ONE OF IS YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE DO IMMEDIATELY. TO GET- COMMUNICATIONS BACK UP. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE ALWAYS DEAL WITH IN THE FIRE SERVICE- IT'S AND IT'S A CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS IS THE MOST CRITICAL ELEMENT. AND SO THAT WHEN WE'RE DOING THAT PART OF IT- SPEED- IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN- THE YOU KNOW THE LINE LOVE THE LONGER OUTLOOK. AND THEN THERE'S THE LONGER OUTLOOK AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOUR BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS- MAKE CALLAWAY ELSE DOES ALREADY COLLECT- THEY THEY'RE THE ONES WHO COORDINATE. ALL OF THE DOWNED POWER ALL THE OUTAGES AND ALL THOSE THINGS ALREADY AND IT JUST SEEMS DUPLICATIVE FROM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PART. TO BE TRYING TO DO THAT- I THINK IS ONE GENTLEMAN IT STATED. IT IT KIND OF MONIES UP WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOIG WHICH IS AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO COMMUNICATING. AND- AND- WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS LONGER TERM IT SEEMS IS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPGRADE SYSTEMS. AND THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION BECAUSE THEN THAT BECOMES PART OF RATE PAYER ISSUES WHERE DOES THE STATE COME IN TO TRY TO HELP UPGRADE THOSE- THE- THOSE NAY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS THEMSELVES- BUT DURING THE A MANAGE THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PART OF IT. IT'S ABOUT THE MOBILE MOBILE COMMUNICATION TRACK SWITCHER OF KIND OF IN IT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE- ACCESSIBILITY LIMITED A LIMITS- AS THEY'RE TRYING TO POSITION THEMSELVES BUT THERE'S ALSO COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS THESE LITTLE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS. THEY CAN BE SET UP TEMPORARILY- AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THE STATE ROLE BUT I SHOULD BE THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE STATE PERSPECTIVES. AS BEING. YOU KNOW READYING OURSELVES FOR THESE TYPE OF EMERGENCIES- BUT I I'M NOT READY TO. GET ON BOARD WITH HAVE IT WITH THE P. YOU SEE- JUMP IN AGAIN- WITH MORE MANDATE- WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO RECOVER FROM. THE PREVIOUS STEP FIVE I MEAN- I THINK A GREAT EXAMPLE IS THE HOME REBUILDING PROCESS THEY'RE STRUGGLING MIGHTILY. BECAUSE THEY'VE BECOME FOCUSED O
