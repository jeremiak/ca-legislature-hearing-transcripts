SURPLUS WE'VE ADDED OVER THREE

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.548
MILLION JOBS SINCE THE DEATH OF

THE RECESSION WE'RE SEEING WAGES

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.318
RISING.

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:20.352
WHEN A STATE WITH MORE

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.821
SCIENTISTS MORE ENGINEERS MORE

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.857
NOBEL LAUREATES MORE VENTURE

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:46.612

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.080

CALIFORNIA DREAM OUT OF REACH

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:51.817
FOR TOO MANY.

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:54.286
BUT WE FACE HARD DECISIONS THAT

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:55.754
ARE COMING DUE.

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:56.922

AND IS DIRECTLY AS I CAN THE

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:08.667
TOUGH CALLS WE MUST MAKE

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:10.569
TOGETHER.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.971
ISSUES LIKE RAIL ON WATER.

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:13.806
AND ENERGY.

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:15.541
HOW WE PROTECT OUR MIGRANTS HOW

LET'S START WITH SOME OF THE

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:37.563
FEAR MONGERING.

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:38.764
THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE WHITE

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:39.832

FOR ME. FOR ME THIS IS AN ECHO

00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:48.807
FROM FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS IN

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:49.708
A NEW MAYOR.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.410
SITTING IN THE GALLERY AT THE

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:52.811
STATE OF THE UNION.

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.680
AND WASHING WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:56.248
SAID THAT THE LGBT AMERICANS

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:58.851
COULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED.

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:00.052
WAS AN ATTACK FROM MY

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.720
PERSPECTIVE ON OUR FRIENDS OUR

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:03.722

I WAS SO PROUD TO WATCH BRAVE

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:08.794
CALIFORNIANS ANSWER THOSE

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.564

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:28.680

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.152
WE MUST STAND UP FOR THOSE THAT

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:34.753

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.855
MARGINALIZED AND SCAPEGOAT.

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:38.457

AT ODDS WITH CALIFORNIA VALUES.

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.201
IT DESCRIBES A COUNTRY WHERE

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.769
INEQUALITY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:51.870
PROBLEM.

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:54.940
WORK CLIMATE CHANGE THEN EXIST.

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:55.741
AND WHERE THE GREATEST THREAT WE

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:59.545
FACE COMES FROM SEEKING ASYLUM

00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:00.712

00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:12.157
LOWEST NUMBER OF BORDER CROSSING

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.063
SEVENTY ONE CALIFORNIA LIKE OUR

IN MORE THAN A DECADE.

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:26.839
SOME FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:27.639
THOUSAND FEWER IN OUR STATE

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:29.508

COMMIT CRIMES AT A LOWER RATE

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:38.317

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:40.118
AND THOSE FAMILIES.

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:41.820
IN THOSE FAMILIES THOSE WOMEN

EMERGENCY IS NOTHING MORE THAN A

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:52.197
MANUFACTURED CRISIS IN

PROJECT AS PLANNED WOULD COST

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.393
TOO MUCH.

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.928
RESPECTFULLY TAKE TOO LONG.

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:37.429
THERE'S BEEN TOO LITTLE

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:38.630
OVERSIGHT.

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:40.632
AND NOT ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY.

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:42.100
RIGHT NOW THERE SIMPLY ISN'T A

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:44.503
PATH TO GET FROM SACRAMENTO TO

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:47.773
SAN DIEGO LET ALONE FROM.

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:48.774
SAN FRANCISCO TO LA.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.909
I WISH THERE WERE [inaudible]

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:51.343
HOWEVER [inaudible]

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:55.013
HE WE DO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.648
COMPLETE A HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:59.017
BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD

00:21:59.084 --> 00:22:00.752
NOW I KNOW.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:03.689
I KNOW SOME CRITICS ARE GONNA

00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:04.289
SAY WELL THAT'S A TRAINED IN A

00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:04.690
WAY.

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.992
BUT I THINK THAT'S WRONG.

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.660
AND I THINK THAT'S OFFENSIVE.

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.529
THE PEOPLE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:11.697
IN DURING THE WORST AIR

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.699
POLLUTION IN AMERICA AND HAVE

00:22:13.765 --> 00:22:15.534
SOME OF THE LONGEST COMMUTES IN

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.401
THIS STATE.

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:17.569
AND THEY HAVE SUFFERED TOO MANY

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:19.404
YEARS OF NEGLECT FROM POLICY

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.440
MAKERS RESPECTFULLY HERE IN

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:23.208
SACRAMENTO.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.377
THEY DESERVE BETTER.

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:27.179
AND A HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT TO

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:39.291
BE PART OF YOU CAN SEE THERE'S

00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:41.026
ANOTHER HIGH SPEED RAIL IS MORE

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:42.260
THAN A TRAIN PROJECT.

00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:43.462
IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:44.463
TRANSFORMATION IT'S ABOUT

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.531
UNLOCKING THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:48.233
OF THE VALLEY.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.035
NO WE CAN ALIGN OUR ECONOMIC AND

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:51.570
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:53.138
ANCHORED BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:54.840
IN TO THEM WITH TOOLS LIKE

00:22:54.906 --> 00:22:56.141
OPPORTUNITIES ONS THAT COULD

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:57.976
FORM THE BACKBONE OF THE RE

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.377
INVIGORATED.

00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:01.146
CENTRAL VALLEY ECONOMY.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.615
MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD AND

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:05.684
COMMUNITIES IN BETWEEN ARE MORE

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:08.220
DYNAMIC THAN PEOPLE REALIZE

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:08.520
[inaudible]

00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:15.293
THE VALLEY.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:15.694
WELL.

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:16.661
THE VALLEY MAY BE KNOWN AROUND

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:18.130
THE WORLD [inaudible] FOR

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:20.065
AGRICULTURE.

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:21.900
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER STORY.

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:23.802
READY TO BE TOLD A STORY OF A

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:26.138
REGION HUNGRY FOR INVESTMENT A

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:28.273
WORK FORCE EAGER FOR MORE

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.107
TRAINING AND GOOD JOBS

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:31.710
CALIFORNIANS THAT DESERVE A FAIR

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:35.447
SHARE OF OUR STATES PROSPERITY.

00:23:35.514 --> 00:23:35.647
LOOK.

00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:37.582

REGIONAL PROJECTS NORTH AND

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:40.218
SOUTH.

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:41.720
WE'LL FINISH PHASE ONE OF THE

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:43.255
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK.

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:44.589
WILL CONNECT THE REVITALIZED

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:45.824
CENTRAL VALLEY TO OTHER PARTS OF

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.759
THE STATE AND WE WILL CONTINUE

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:49.294
TO PUSH FOR FOR MORE FEDERAL

00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:51.463
FUNDING AND PRIVATE DOLLARS.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.900
BUT LET'S GET SOMETHING DONE

00:23:54.966 --> 00:24:03.975
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:05.277

THIS.

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:08.747
WHOLE PROJECT.

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:10.982
SO TO GIVE UP ON THIS ALL IN

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:13.151
THIS OFFER YOU THIS.

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:14.586
ABANDONING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:16.488
ENTIRELY MEANS WE WILL HAVE

00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:18.690
WASTED BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:21.426
DOLLARS WITH NOTHING BUT BROKEN

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:23.328
PROMISES PARTIALLY.

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:25.363
FILLED COMMITMENTS AND LAWSUITS

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.998
TO SHOW FOR AND WITH ALL DUE

00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:27.966
RESPECT.

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:30.135
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SENDING

00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:31.970
BACK THREE AND A HALF BILLION

00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:33.972
DOLLARS OF FEDERAL FUNDING THAT

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:36.041
WAS ALLOCATED TO THIS PROJECT TO

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:37.943
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:39.945
THAT WOULD DO IT AT THAT

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:40.545
FUNDAMENTALLY WOULD HAVE TO

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:41.847
HAPPEN.

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:43.381
BUT WE JUST WALKED AWAY.

00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:45.116
BUT ALSO I'M NOT INTERESTED IN

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:46.885
MAKING THE SAME ALL MISTAKES AND

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:48.353
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M ORDERING

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.689
SOME NEW TRANSPARENCY MEASURES.

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.557
GONNA HOLD CONTRACTORS.

00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:54.326

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:58.263
HOW TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.131
INCLUDING CHANGE ORDERS COST

00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:02.067
OVER RUNS AND EVEN TRAVEL

00:25:02.133 --> 00:25:18.250
EXPENSES

00:25:22.454 --> 00:25:22.520
.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.288
WE'RE ALSO WERE ALSO GOING TO

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:23.889
SEIZE OF GOVERNANCE CHANGES

00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:25.257
STARTING WITH MY MY PICK FOR THE

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:26.791
NEXT CHAIR OF THE HIGH SPEED

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.460
RAIL AUTHORITY LENNY MEN DOGS UP

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:38.803
MY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.105
ONE IS YOU KNOW IS IS RUNNING

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:41.773
ECONOMIC A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.607
AND I THIS FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:42.807
THAT.

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:45.076
TRANSPORTATION AND ECONOMIC

00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:47.913
DEVELOPMENT GO HAND IN HAND SO.

00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:48.546
THAT'S A POSITION OUR HIGH SPEED

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:49.714
RIGHT.

00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:54.619
LET'S TALK ABOUT WATER.

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:56.955
WE NEED A FRESH APPROACH WHEN IT

00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:58.990
COMES TO MEETING CALIFORNIA'S

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:01.059
MASSIVE WATER CHALLENGES.

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:03.295
WITH A BIG STATE DIVERSE WATER

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:04.863
NEEDS CITIES IN THAT THAT NEED

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.131
CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

00:26:06.197 --> 00:26:08.300
FARMS IN THE IRRIGATION TO KEEP

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:09.567
FEEDING THE WORLD FRAGILE

00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:11.269
ECOSYSTEMS THAT MUST BE

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:12.304
PROTECTED.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.738
OUR WATER SUPPLIES BECOMING LESS

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:15.106
RELIABLE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE

00:26:15.173 --> 00:26:16.574
CHANGE IN OUR POPULATIONS

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:17.442
GROWING.

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:19.277
BECAUSE A STRONG ECONOMY.

00:26:19.344 --> 00:26:20.979
THAT MEANS A LOT OF DEMAND ON

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:22.847
UNPREDICTABLE SUPPLY.

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:24.883
THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS BUT

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.553
LET ME BE AS DIRECT ABOUT WHERE

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.421
I STAND AS I CAN'T.

00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:31.957
I DO NOT SUPPORT THE WATER FIX

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:33.458
AS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED.

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:35.260
MEETING I DO NOT SUPPORT THE

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:45.537
TWIN TOWERS.

00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:48.740
WE CAN HOWEVER BUILD ON THE

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:49.341
IMPORTANT WORK THAT'S ALREADY

00:26:49.407 --> 00:26:50.542
BEEN DONE.

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:51.109
AND THAT'S WHY I DO SUPPORT.

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:55.780
A C. THE STATUS QUO IS NOT AN

00:26:55.847 --> 00:26:57.015
OPTION.

00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:58.583
WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR WATER

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.452
SUPPLY FROM EARTHQUAKES FROM

00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:02.020
RISING SEA LEVELS WE NEED TO

00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:03.755
PRESERVE DELTA FISHERIES AND WE

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:05.690
NEED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CITIES

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:06.925
AND FARMS.

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:08.994
WE HAVE GOT TO GET PAST IS ALL

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.129
BINARIES LIKE FARMERS VERSUS

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:12.464
ENVIRONMENTALISTS THE NORTH

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.732
VERSUS SOUTH.

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:16.634
OUR APPROACH CAN'T BE EITHER OR

00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:18.903
IT HAS TO BE YES AND CONVEYANCE

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.672
AND EFFICIENCY.

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:22.741
AND RECYCLING PROJECTS LIKE THE

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:23.908
ONES WERE SEEN IN SOUTHERN

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:26.144
CALIFORNIA MET WATER DISTRICT.

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:27.912
EXPANDING FLOOD PLAINS IN THE

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:29.814
CENTRAL VALLEY GROUNDWATER

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:31.116
RECHARGE LIKE FARMERS ARE

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:34.085
ALREADY DOING IN FRESNO COUNTY.

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:35.587
A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO THE

00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:37.622
BUILDING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:39.257
MEETING LONG TERM DEMAND.

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.760
IN TO HELP BRING THIS BALANCE.

00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:43.695
I'M APPOINTING A NEW CHAIR TO

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:47.832
THE CALIFORNIA WATER BOARD LOS

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:51.770
JOAQUIN ESCADA.

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:58.243
IN HIS FIRST TASK.

00:27:58.309 --> 00:27:59.944
HIS FIRST TASK OUR COLLECTIVE

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:00.979
EFFORT MUST BE TO CROSS THE

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:03.381
FINISH LINE ON REAL AGREEMENTS

00:28:03.448 --> 00:28:05.417
TO SAVE THE SAT SACRAMENTO.

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:06.818
SAN JOAQUIN BAY DELTA.

00:28:06.885 --> 00:28:08.119
WE MUST GET THIS DONE FOR THE

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:09.587
RESILIENCE OF A MIGHTY RIVERS.

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:10.789
FOR THE STABILITY OF OUR

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:13.024
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN THE

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:14.692
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:15.727
THAT DEPEND ON THIS WATER

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:17.796
EVERYDAY.

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:20.365
NOW LET'S TALK HONESTLY ABOUT

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:27.205
CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

00:28:27.272 --> 00:28:29.941
AND THIS IS NOT ME TAKING A SIP

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:31.743
AS A PROP --

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.411
BUT JUST THIS MORNING.

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:35.547
JUST THIS MORNING MORE THAN A

00:28:35.613 --> 00:28:37.949
MILLION CALIFORNIANS WOKE UP

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:40.718
WITHOUT CLEAN WATER BASIN LET

00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:42.120
ALONE DRINK.

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:43.888
SOME SCHOOLS HAVE SHUT DOWN

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:45.190
DRINKING FOUNTAINS DUE TO

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.391
CONTAMINATION.

00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:48.093
SOME POOR COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:50.395
I RECENTLY VISITED IN STANISLAUS

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:53.098
COUNTY ARE PAYING MORE FOR ON

00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:54.599
DRINKABLE WATER.

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:57.502
THEN BEVERLY HILLS PAYS FOR PER

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.737

00:28:59.804 --> 00:29:01.673
PRISTINE WATER.

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:02.941
WITH RESPECT THIS IS A MORAL

00:29:03.007 --> 00:29:04.442
DISGRACE AND IT'S A MEDICAL

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:05.076
EMERGENCY.

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:07.378
THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF

THEY WILL WORK WITH MY STRIKE

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:03.334
TEAM TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.370

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.022
ON ACHIEVING THE NATION'S MOST

00:30:24.088 --> 00:30:34.799
AMBITIOUS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS.

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:37.569
BUT THE PROBLEMS WE FACE ARE FAR

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:37.802
GREATER.

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:39.304
THAN TEACHING.

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.004
CLIMATE CHANGE IS PUTTING

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:41.873
PRESSURE ON ALL OF OUR UTILITIES

CREDIT RATINGS DOWN WITH.

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.883
THIS PRESSURE COMES AT A TIME

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.452
WHEN THE ENTIRE ENERGY MARKET IS

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.321
EVOLVING FROM ROOFTOP SOLAR WIND

ANTICIPATE THESE CHANGES.

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:20.678
SO WE MUST MAP OUT A LONGER TERM

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:22.247

THE TIME WE'RE SPENDING MORE ON

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:15.933

SCHOOL SYSTEMS EXCELLENCE IS

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:01.913
MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS BUDGETS.

WE NEED CLEAR AND ACHIEVABLE

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:52.436
PENSION.

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:53.838
AND A SUPPORT CIRCLE OF FAMILY

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:55.239

THOSE ADVANTAGE.

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.244
ALL OF THOSE ADVANTAGES.

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:01.412
WITH THE DAILY CHALLENGE FOR HIM

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:02.747

00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:03.748
IN PLACE AND MAINTAIN.

00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:05.549
A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE.

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.551
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIAN SHERRY

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:10.254
SIMILAR STORY AND THE NUMBERS.

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:11.322
ARE THE ONLY GROW.

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:14.058
IT'S TIME FOR A NEW MASTER PLAN

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:31.809
ON AGING IN CALIFORNIA

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:39.617
.

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:40.785
YOU KNOW IT'S GOT --

00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:42.520
DRESS PERSON CENTERED CARE.

00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:45.122
THE PATCHWORK OF PUBLIC SERVICES.

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:47.758
GOT ADDRESS SOCIAL ISOLATION.

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:49.193
BETTER LOCK SENIORS THE NEED

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.861
TRANSPORTATION.

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:54.932
DRESS THE NURSING SHORTAGE LV

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.634
ENDS IN OUR ENDS.

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.102
AND THE DEMAND ON AYE HSS ARNOLD

00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.403
SUPPORT SERVICES THAT FAR

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.172
OUTPACES ITS CAPACITY.

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:02.673
AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:03.774
AGING WITHOUT ALSO FOCUSING ON

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:07.912
ALL TIMES. TOO MANY OF US IN THE

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:09.280
CRUSHING GRIP OF THIS DISEASE ON

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:10.481
OUR LOVED ONES ESPECIALLY ON OUR

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:12.717
WIVES AND MOTHERS.

00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:14.618
BECAUSE TWO THIRDS OF ALL NEW

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:17.054
ALZHEIMER'S CASES ARE WOMEN. TWO

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:18.489
THIRDS.

00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:19.957
SO TODAY I'M WATCHING THE ALL

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:20.791
TIMES PREVENTION AND

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:21.459
PREPAREDNESS TASK FORCE BRING IN

00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:22.860
THE MOST RENOWNED SCIENTIST AND

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:23.728
THINKERS TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THE

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:24.895
FIRST OF ITS KIND RESEARCH IN

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:25.930
THIS AREA.

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:27.264
IT WILL BE HEADED.

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:29.066
BY LEADING ADVOCATE FOR FAMILIES

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:30.868
DEALING WITH ALZHEIMER'S.

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:35.706
AND THAT IS OUR FORMER EIGHTY

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:38.309
MARIA SHRIVER [inaudible]

00:39:38.375 --> 00:40:00.231
AND WE'RE UHHUH

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:01.832
[inaudible]

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.901
DIE TOGETHER.

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:06.036
MANY OF THESE ARE CHALLENGES WE

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.004
FACE IS THE BROADER COST.

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:08.839
CRISIS.

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:10.307
IN A RECENT SURVEY CAME OUT LAST

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:13.310
WEEK 61% OF YOUNG ADULTS IN

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:15.579
CALIFORNIA SO THEY CAN'T AFFORD

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:17.882
TO LIVE. 61%.

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:18.849
CALIFORNIA SHOULD NEVER BE A

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:19.950
PLACE WHERE ONLY THE WELL OFF

00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:21.619
CAN LEAD A GOOD LIFE.

00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:22.920
AND IT STARTS WITH HOUSING

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:25.489
PERHAPS THE MOST OVERWHELMING

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:27.691
CHALLENGE WE FACE RIGHT NOW.

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:32.096
WE ALL KNOW THE PROBLEM.

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:34.465
WELL THE PROBLEM. TOO MUCH

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:36.967
DEMAND. TOO LITTLE SUPPORT.

00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:37.968
AND THAT IS HAPPENING IN LARGE

00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:39.703
PART BECAUSE TOO MANY CITIES AND

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.405
COUNTIES AREN'T EVEN PLANNING

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:42.740
HOW TO BUILD.

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:44.575
SUMMER FLAT OUT REFUSING TO DO

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:46.076
ANYTHING AT ALL.

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:48.279
THAT'S WHY I COMMITTED SEVEN

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:48.813
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:50.080
DOLLARS FOR A MAJOR NEW

00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:52.049
INCENTIVE PACKAGE FOR

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.017
COMMUNITIES TO DO THE RIGHT

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.985
THING. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:56.120
DOLLARS IN SUPPORT FOR CITIES

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:57.655
AND COUNTIES TO UPDATE THEIR

00:40:57.721 --> 00:40:58.856
HOUSING PLANS TO REVAMP THERE'S

00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:00.825
ONLY PROCESS AND GET MORE

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:02.860
HOUSING ENTITLED. FIVE HUNDRED

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:05.629
MORE IN GRANTS WHEN THEY ACHIEVE

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:07.798
CERTAIN MILESTONES.

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:09.266
PUT IT WE WANT A CALIFORNIA FOR

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:11.502
ALL WE HAVE TO BUILD HOUSING FOR

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:27.618
ALL

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:36.760
.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.428
I WANT TO SUPPORT LOCAL

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:39.129
GOVERNMENTS.

00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:39.897
I WANT TO SUPPORT LOCAL

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.198
GOVERNMENTS TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:42.299
LIKE ANAHEIM.

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:44.301
LIKE SANTA ROSA.

00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:44.768
BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:45.402
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE THAT DO

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:47.805
NOT.

00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:49.206
CAN ALL TWO WEEKS AGO.

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:51.208
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUED THE

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:52.309
CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH FOR

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:53.544
FAILING TO MEET.

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:54.745
ITS OBLIGATIONS ON AFFORDABLE

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:55.913
HOUSING LET ME JUST TELL YOU

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.847
LOOK AT THE FORMER MAYOR THE

LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS THE

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:00.618
START MY TERM.

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:02.686
SUING THE CITY.

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:04.021
BUT RESPECTFULLY THEY LEFT US NO

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:05.689
CHOICE.

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:06.857
BY THE WAY IT'S NOT BOB PICKING

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:09.493
ON HUNTINGTON BEACH THEY JUST

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.095
HAPPEN TO BE FIRST BECAUSE OF A

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:12.196
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:13.864
BUT THERE ARE FORTY SEVEN OTHER

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:15.132
CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.433
ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH THEIR

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.868
PLANNING REQUIREMENTS IN ONE WAY

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:19.336
OR ANOTHER.

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:21.171
SOME CITIES ARE TRYING LIKE

00:42:21.238 --> 00:42:22.373
CLOTHES.

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:24.608

NOT GOING TO PRESIDE OVER

00:42:41.191 --> 00:42:59.476
NEGLECT AND DENIAL ANY LONGER

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:10.421

I WAS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL I

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:13.791
I'M NOT NAIVE.

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.426
THAT CITIES NEED TO SOME OF THAT

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:17.227
POLITICAL COURAGE AND WE GONNA

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.396

OKAY I ALSO WANTING KNOWLEDGE.

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:21.465
THAT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS

00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:23.334
BEYOND CITY PLANNING THAT HAVE

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.035
LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:26.437
MORE HOUSES.

00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:27.871
IN RECENT YEARS YOU KNOW.

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.573
WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB EXPEDITING

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.376
JUDICIAL REVIEW ON SEA QUEST FOR

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:48.759
PROFESSIONAL SPORTS

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:55.699

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:56.166
THERE'S SOME GOOD THINGS

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:57.568
HAPPENING.

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:59.269
SOMEONE APPLAUD.

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:00.037
THE RECENT EFFORTS BY HOME

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:01.438
BUILDERS AND LABOR LEADERS WHO

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:02.740
TOGETHER WORKING TO FORGE A

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:03.907
COMPROMISE IN THE SPACE TO

ACCELERATE PRODUCTION.

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:06.210
BUT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:07.811
ACHIEVE OUR AMBITIOUS TARGETS

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:09.780
UNLESS WE TRAIN A SKILLED

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.248
WORKFORCE.

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:12.616
THAT'S BIG ENOUGH TO MEET THE

00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:14.151
CHALLENGE AND ALSO.

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:16.687
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE WORKERS

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:18.389

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:21.091
HIGH ENOUGH TO ALSO SUPPORT

THEIR FAMILIES.

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:31.402

THIS YEAR.

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:38.275
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT.

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:39.510
LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT SOMETHING

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:41.078
ELSE.

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:42.980
A LOT OF US MADE COMMITMENTS

THE BALLOT LAST NOVEMBER.

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:49.653
AND THE PRESSURE ON VULNERABLE

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.322
RENTERS DID NOT GO AWAY.

00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:54.158
AFTER ELECTION.

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:56.060
WE NEED NEW RULES TO STABILIZE

00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:58.195
NEIGHBORHOODS TO PREVENT THE

00:44:58.262 --> 00:45:00.164
VACATIONS WITHOUT PUTTING SMALL

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.832

MAKING SURE HEALTHCARE IS A FOR

00:45:42.139 --> 00:45:43.407

ACT.

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:57.121
THEIR VANDALISM BY THE WAY IS

00:45:57.187 --> 00:45:58.689
ALREADY DONE.

00:45:58.755 --> 00:45:59.857
EXTRAORDINARY DAMAGE IN

00:45:59.923 --> 00:46:02.226
CALIFORNIA BY ELIMINATING THE

00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:03.694
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.729
THIS YEAR COVERED CALIFORNIA'S

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:08.065
PREMIUMS INCREASED ALMOST TWICE

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:09.533
AS MUCH.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.835
AS WE HAD EXPECTED.

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:13.370
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE FEAR AND

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:14.738
RESPECT LIKE IT'S EXACTLY WHAT

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:16.240
THEY WANT.

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:17.574
AND THAT'S WHY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:18.942
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.078
CALIFORNIA MUST ACT WHERE

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:29.820
WASHINGTON HAS FAILED.

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:31.255

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:46.236
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT.

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:47.838

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:54.244
AMERICA.

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:55.846

THIS IS ONLY PART OF THE

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:17.561
SOLUTION.

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:19.029
COSTS IS ANOTHER.

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:21.531

THEY MADE MEDICAL CARE SIMPLY

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:31.742
MORE EXPENSIVE

00:48:31.808 --> 00:48:32.676
WE ALSO MUST CONTINUE TO BRING

LESS THAN THEIR PARENTS DID AT

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.790

MUCH AS THREE TIMES.

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.970
LOOK IN THIS ECONOMY

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:40.270

J. BACK.

00:50:42.005 --> 00:50:42.773

WORLD OF WORK IS IN A PERPETUAL

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:46.309
STATE OF FLUX WHERE WORKERS ARE

00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:48.078
TOO OFTEN DISPLACED THE VALUE TO

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:49.346
DISCONNECTED FROM THE SOCIAL

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:50.881
SAFETY NET WE ALSO MUST.

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:52.282
THINK BIGGER.

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:53.884
IT'S TIME TO DEVELOP A NEW

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.052
MODERN COMPACT FOR CALIFORNIA'S

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:57.287

THIS RESPECTFULLY IS MUCH BIGGER

00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:00.824
THAN DYNAMAX.

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.993
CALIFORNIA NEEDS A COMPREHENSIVE

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:05.996
STATEWIDE STRATEGY UP LIFT AND

00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:07.798
UP SKILL OUR WORKERS TO ENSURE

00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:09.666
THAT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:12.269
IN A AYE BLOCKCHAIN BIG DATA ARE

00:51:12.335 --> 00:51:14.938
CREATING JOBS NOT DESTROYING

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:23.480
JOBS.

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:24.681
I BELIEVE WE NEED TO REFORM.

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.049
OUR INSTITUTIONS THAT SO THE

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:28.151
MORE WORKERS HAVE AN OWNERSHIP

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:28.819
STAKE.

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:31.054
IN THEIR SWEAT EQUITY.

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:32.255

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:34.958
FUTURE OF WORK THAT WILL BRING

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:35.926
TOGETHER LEADERS FROM LABOR

00:51:35.992 --> 00:51:37.160
BUSINESS WILL PUBLIC.

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:38.462
AND PRIVATE IN THEIR SIMON IS

00:51:38.528 --> 00:51:40.096
THIS TO COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:41.665
TO EXPAND WORKER OPPORTUNITY

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:43.433
WITHOUT EXTINGUISHING INNOVATION

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.435
OF FLEXIBILITY.

00:51:45.502 --> 00:51:46.436
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S OBVIOUSLY

00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:48.605
PROUD. TO BE HOME TECHNOLOGY

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:49.606
COMPANIES THAT ARE DETERMINED TO

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:50.607
CHANGE THE WORLD THE COMPANIES

00:51:50.674 --> 00:51:52.342

OF DOLLARS COLLECTING.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.179
CURATING MONETIZING OUR PERSONAL

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:58.448
DATA ALSO HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT.

00:51:58.515 --> 00:51:59.616
CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:01.284
AND CONTROL HOW THEIR DATA IS

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:04.654
BEING USED THANK YOU FOR PASSING

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:06.623
THE FIRST IN THE NATION DIGITAL

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:16.967
PRIVACY LAW LAST YEAR

[inaudible]

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:19.102
WELL.

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:21.404
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SHOULD ALSO

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:24.040
BE ABLE TO SHARE IN THE WEALTH.

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:27.177
THAT IS CREATED FROM THEIR DATA

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:29.546
SO I ASKED MY TEAM TO DEVELOP A

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:33.416
PROPOSAL FOR A NEW DATA DIVIDEND

00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:38.522
FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:43.393
RE RECORD. TO YOU WE CAN DO

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.262
SOMETHING BOLD IN THE SPACE.

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:49.299
LET ME AND BY MAKING THE OBVIOUS

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:50.534
POINT WOULD COVER A LOT OF BROWN.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.069
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT

00:52:53.136 --> 00:52:56.506
DESERVES OUR FOCUS CLIMATE

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:57.807
CHANGE REFORM IN OUR TAX CODE.

00:52:57.874 --> 00:52:59.676

MAJOR NATIONS LIKE PAID SICK

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:01.611
LEAVE UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL FREE

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.947
COMMUNITY COLLEGE REIMAGINING

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:10.253
THE DMV.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.588
THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH MORE IT

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:12.756
WILL BE TAKEN OUT ALL THOSE

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:14.558
ISSUES AND MORE.

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:17.928
IN THE COMING MONTHS.

00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:19.329
HI MY NOT ARRIVE.

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:20.664
A FEW WEEKS BACK I QUOTED THE

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.532
SERMON ON THE MOUNT.

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:24.601
ABOUT A HOUSE.

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:25.969
I DID NOT CALL THE FACE OF

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:26.970
FLOODS.

00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:27.904
AND STORMS BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:29.306
UPON A ROCK.

00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:30.774
A PROMISE THAT TOGETHER WE WILL

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.708
BUILD ONE HOUSE FOR ONE

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.076
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.744
WE STARTED DRAWING THE BLUEPRINT

00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:36.846
FOR THAT HOUSE IN IT TOGETHER.

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:38.114
GONNA FINISHES BUT THIS GOES

00:53:38.181 --> 00:53:39.549
DEEPER THAN BUDGET NUMBERS

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:40.784
FRIEDMAN PROGRAM DETAILS THIS IS

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.218
ABOUT THE BONDS.

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:43.987
BETWEEN US AS HUMAN BEINGS.

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:45.989
AND I ST PAUL SAID WE ARE MANY

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.857
PARTS BUT ONE BODY.

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:49.426
WERE ALL DIMINISHED WHEN ONE OF

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:52.262
THE STRUGGLES THE PROBLEMS WE

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:54.497
FACE ARE AS HARD AS THEY COME IN

00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:55.732
THERE IN MANY CASES DECADES IN

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.467
THE MAKING.

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:59.336
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE WE HAVE THE

00:53:59.402 --> 00:54:00.070
TOOLS TO SOLVE THEM WITH THE

00:54:00.136 --> 00:54:03.106
TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE THE KNOW HOW

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:04.374
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY.

00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:05.442
WE HAVE THE GENEROSITY OF OUR

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:07.911
PEOPLE.

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:09.846
