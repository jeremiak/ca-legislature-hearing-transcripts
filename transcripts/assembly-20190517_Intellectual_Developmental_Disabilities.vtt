REFLECTION OF VIRUSES VALUES AND

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:35.848
DEDICATION TO THE COMMUNITY.

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.983
IT ONLY INDICATES THE SCOPE OF

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.885
THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO MEET.

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:41.921
THE CHALLENGING NEEDS OF THE

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:42.755
CONSUMERS.

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:44.623
SEEK EDUCATION RECEIVE SUPPORT

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.724
FROM OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS TO

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:47.593
DELIVER EFFECTIVE AND HIGH

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.361
QUALITY PROGRAMS.

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:51.297
THE PROPOSED REDUCED RATE HAS

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:52.464
LED TO A DIFFICULT DECISION OF

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:54.533
COMPROMISING THE INTEGRITY OF

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.167
THE PROGRAM.

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:57.203
A POSITION THAT WOULD BE AN

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.038
APPLICABLE AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:00.940
TO ADDRESS THE VERY CHALLENGE

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:02.007
THAT INITIALLY BROUGHT US

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:03.876
TOGETHER.

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:06.779
AND THE END OF THIS.

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:07.379
TOGETHER ON THIS ENDEAVOR AND

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:09.682
QUOTE.

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:11.650
WE REALIZE I RC WE REALIZE WE

00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:12.785
HAD I RC REALIZE THAT WE HAVE

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.687
DIVERSE POPULATION OF CONSUMERS

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:19.258
OR UNDERSERVED OR UNSERVED.

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.293
AGAIN WE ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.361
CHANGE THIS.

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:23.429
HOWEVER REACHING OUT TO

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:25.297
UNDERSERVED CONSUMERS AND

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.232
RETHINKING OUR SERVICE DESIGNS

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:27.333
WILL COME AT A COST.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.667
HIGHER SEAT IS NOT COMPLETE ITS

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:29.368
FISCAL YEAR WITH THE PURCHASE OF

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:32.838
SERVICE SURPLUS WE SPEND ALL THE

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:36.375
MONEY THAT WE ARE ALLOCATED.

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:38.244
ACCORDING TO THE DDS DASHBOARD

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.612
FOUND ON THEIR WEBSITE THE

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:42.314
AVERAGE EXPENDITURE FOR

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.883
CONSUMERS OF ALL AGES STATEWIDE.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.852
IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND THIRTY SIX

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:48.053
DOLLARS PER CONSUMER PER YEAR.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.722
HOWEVER AND HIGHER SEIZE

00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:50.522
CATCHMENT AREA THAT AMOUNT IS

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:51.790
ONLY TEN THOUSAND EIGHTY PER

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:52.224
CONSUMER PER YEAR.

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:52.891
WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THAT

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.126
THE OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS ARE

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:56.128
OVER FUNDED WE REALIZE THEY HAVE

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:58.163
THEIR OWN SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.165
HOWEVER WE DO HOPE THAT HIGHER

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:00.933
SEE MY SEE MORE COMPARABLE

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.102
DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS IN THE

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:03.869
FUTURE.

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:05.070
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:06.038
ALSO THAT IN THE COACHELLA

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:08.874
VALLEY WHERE WE HAVE TWO

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:09.508
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:09.808
CONSUMERS.

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:16.482
WE SPENT TWO MILLION.

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:16.982
SIX HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:17.683
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TEN THOUSAND

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.284
SEVENTY SEVEN PER CONSUMER PER

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.385
YEAR.

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:21.253
THIS IS JUST THREE DOLLARS PER

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.421
YEAR LESS THAN WE SPEND PER

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.556
CONSUMER THROUGHOUT THE REST OF

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:25.190
OUR CATCHMENT AREA.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:27.059
ANOTHER ISSUES THAT ARE EXISTING

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:28.260
SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE HAVING

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:30.062
GREAT DIFFICULTY HIRING STAFF

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:32.831
BECAUSE THE RATES HIGHER SEE IS

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.933
ALLOWED TO OFFER ARE SO LOW.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.168
THEY SIMPLY CAN'T COMPETE WITH

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:37.770
OTHER INDUSTRIES.

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:38.704
IF WE DEVELOP MORE PROGRAMS ONE

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.706
MORE REASONABLE RATES AND WE

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:41.607
PROVIDE MORE SERVICES TO

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:43.609
UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED DIVERSE

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.577
POPULATIONS ARE PER CAPITA

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:46.679
EXPENDITURES ARE SURE TO

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.380
INCREASE.

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:49.782
WITH THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:53.218
CONSUMERS AND GROWING IF WE JUST

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:54.186
WOULD NEED TO PURCHASE A SERVICE.

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:56.455
AUGMENTATION OF A HUNDRED AND

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:57.089
FOURTEEN MILLION.

00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:59.058
HOWEVER EVEN RELATIVELY SMALL

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.960
CHANGES IMPLEMENTED AND VERY

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:03.028
LARGE REGIONAL CENTERS CAN HAVE

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:05.798
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT.

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:07.766
FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:10.736
THE THIRTY HOUR MONTH CAP ON

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.571
RESPITE WAS REMOVED.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:13.906
WE WERE WE VERY MUCH A PLOT THAT

00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:14.940
DECISION BUT AS A RESULT HIGHER

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:18.344
SEES ANYONE RESPITE EXPENDITURE.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.411
FOR JUMPED FROM APPROXIMATELY

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:22.247
FIFTY TWO MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:22.681
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:24.350
APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THREE

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:26.385
MILLION AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:28.253
AND IS NOW UP OVER EIGHTY FOUR

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.890
MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR.

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:32.458
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS IS AN

00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:33.058
INCREASE OF OVER THIRTY TWO

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.060
MILLION IN THE PAST TWO YEARS

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:36.862
AND RESPITE ALONE.

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.664
OUR SEIZE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS P.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.599
O. S. DISPARITY HAVE PLAYED A

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:41.667
ROLE IN IN THIS RESULT SINCE

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:45.738
JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:46.372
THE NUMBER OF NEW AUTHORS

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:48.407
RESPITE AUTHORIZATIONS.

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:51.377
ERROR SEE IS.

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:51.977
FOUR THOUSAND NINETY EIGHT OF

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:53.445
THESE NEW REQUEST THREE THOUSAND

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:56.048
EIGHT ARE APPROXIMATELY 75% OR

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:57.049
FOR CONSUMERS WHO PREVIOUSLY

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.984
RECEIVED NO POS.

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:00.219
WE REALIZE WE HAVE GAS AND

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:01.987
DEFICIT CENTER SERVICE PROJECT

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:02.921
PROVISION AND ARE WELL AND

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:04.256
WELCOME THE FEEDBACK FROM THE

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:05.791
COMMUNITY.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.826
AND HELPING US IDENTIFY AND

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:08.694
ADDRESS THE PRIORITIES.

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:10.696
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN MORE

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:11.764
RURAL AREAS WHERE IT IS

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.766
DIFFICULT TO TRACK SERVICE

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.501
SERVICE PROVIDERS.

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:16.668
I SHOULD NOTE THAT ONE OF THE

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:17.569
REASONS OUR RATES ARE SO LOW AS

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:19.471
THE TRADITIONALLY HIGHER SEE WAS

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.273
A VERY CONSERVATIVE EVEN CHEAP

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.307
REGIONAL CENTER.

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.176
THE RESULT IS THAT RATES

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:26.178
NEGOTIATED A DECADE OR TWO A OR

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.013
TWO AGO RELATIVELY LOW.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.081
WHILE THIS MAY BE ADMIRABLE FROM

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.049
THE TAXPAYER PERSPECTIVE IT IS

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:32.050
HAD SERIOUS LONG TERM NEGATIVE

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:34.787
CONSEQUENCES FOR HIGHER C..

00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:36.855
DESPITE OUR AIR SEIZE CURRENT

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:38.690
EFFORTS TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY.

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:39.825
ELEVEN YEARS AGO WELL FOR

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:43.629
INSTITUTIONS COAT FORTY SIX

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:44.463
NINETY ONE WAS INSTITUTED AND

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.432
LIMITED HIGHER SEIZE ABILITY TO

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:47.633
OFFER RATES THAT EXCEEDED

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:50.302
EXISTENT EXISTING MEDIAN RATES.

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.171
THIS IS COUNTRY SIGNIFICANTLY

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:54.173
CONTRIBUTED TO THE STAGNATION

00:17:54.239 --> 00:18:00.312
AND RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT IN OUR

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:01.079
AREA.

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:01.980
I'M SURE THAT YOU ARE AWARE THAT

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:03.081
THERE WAS A RECENT ATTEMPT BY

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.950
DDS AND A CONTRACTOR BURNS AND

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:06.185
ASSOCIATES TO LOOK AT RATE.

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:06.819
ADJUSTMENTS.

00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:07.753
WE HAVE SUMMARISED OUR

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.688
OPPOSITION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:10.689
OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS IN A

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.591
LETTER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:13.659
AND MARCH NINETEENTH.

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:16.795
AND IN A MEETING WITH HER ON

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:17.396
APRIL FIFTEENTH.

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.331
THERE ARE COPIES AVAILABLE FOR

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:20.299
IF YOU WISH TO REVIEW THEM.

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:23.268
WE DO SUPPORT THE 8% SHORT TERM

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:24.336
ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:27.139
PROPOSED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.106
FRAZIER AND HOLDEN.

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.042
AND WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF

00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:31.910
THEIR EFFORTS TO PROPOSE THIS.

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:33.111
ALTHOUGH THE FOCUS OF THIS

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:34.847
DISCUSSION HAS BEEN THE NEED TO

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:35.881
AUGMENT SERVICE PROVIDER RATES

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.850
AND INCREASE OUR PURCHASES

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:38.717
SERVICE BUDGET.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.686
WE WOULD ALSO ASK THAT YOU LOOK

00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:41.753
AT AND CONSIDER THE METS

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.523
METHODOLOGY FOR FUNDING IRIS.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.591
REGIONAL CENTER [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:47.426
OPERATIONS COST.

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:49.661
AS YOU KNOW HIGH STAFFING RATIOS

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:51.296
ARE PROBLEM PRETTY MUCH

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:51.897
THROUGHOUT THE REGIONAL CENTER

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.398
SYSTEM.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.267
IN SOME REGIONAL CENTERS.

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:57.269
IN SOME REGIONAL CENTERS HAVING

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:59.238
ADEQUATE STAFFING MAY AMOUNT TO

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:02.140
REPLACING PEOPLE WHO LEAVE OR

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:03.308
HIRING OCCASIONAL GROWTH

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:05.077
POSITIONS.

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:06.144
HOWEVER AND I RC WERE GROWTH IS

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:08.080
TREMENDOUS WE NEED TO HIRE NOT

00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:09.915
JUST FOR VACANCIES BUT ALSO TO

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.783
MEET THAT TREMENDOUS GROWTH.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.952
THAT MEANS ADDITIONAL FURNITURE

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.821
EQUIPMENT TRAVEL AND MILEAGE

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:17.956
COSTS WHICH CURRENTLY EXCEED A

00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:19.725
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:21.493
AND EVENTUALLY MORE OFFICE SPACE

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.028
WE NEED GOOD KIND OF A COP.

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:24.663
IT HAPPENS ASIAN PACKAGE TO

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.298
ATTRACT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES IN

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:28.233
TRADITIONAL FUNDING STRATEGIES.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.204
THAT THE STATE USES ARE BOTH

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:34.039
ANTIQUATED AND INSUFFICIENT.

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:34.873
THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN DECEMBER

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:35.941
OF TWENTY FIFTEEN RESULT AN

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.776
ATTORNEY TO SIGNIFICANTLY

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:38.744
INCREASE OUR SECURITY COST YET

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.746
NONE OF THIS WAS CONSIDERED AN

00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:41.747
ART BUDGET ALLOCATION.

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:43.815
IN FACT WE ACTUALLY RETURN ONE

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.884
POINT ABOUT. ONE POINT FOUR

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:48.420

FACTORS THAT COME INTO PLAY FOR

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:34.746
THAT.

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:37.716
BUT WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING IN

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:43.755
THIS AREA AND WE ARE AT THIS

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.824

THANK YOU.

00:23:52.397 --> 00:23:54.199
AS IT RELATES TO THE RATES IN

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:55.433
THE REIMBURSEMENT THAT'S BEEN AN

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.268
ISSUE THAT OUR OFFICES HAD A

00:23:56.334 --> 00:23:58.170
CONVERSATION WITH YOU BEFORE

00:23:58.236 --> 00:24:00.138
WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:01.039
MOVING FORWARD.

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:03.875
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT A

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:06.845
GREATER -- A PRESENCE OF A

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:10.015
PROVIDERS IN THE AREA FOR THE

00:24:10.081 --> 00:24:11.583
CLASS.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.517
I MEAN WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE

00:24:12.584 --> 00:24:13.418
IMPACT OF THE RATE STUDIES OR

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:14.553
ANY THAT IS GOING TO MEAN -- BUT

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:17.322
THE FOR INSTANCE THE MEDIAN RATE

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:18.557
ISSUE IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR US

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:20.225
BECAUSE AS I EXPLAINED EARLIER

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.326
THAT.

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:23.461
IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD VERY LOW

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:24.162
RATES HERE.

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:26.097
IN NEGOTIATED VERY LOW RATES AND

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:26.665
THEN THEY ESSENTIALLY PUT A

00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:29.067
FREEZE BACK ELEVEN YEARS AGO

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.169
THAT SAID THAT NO NEW RATES CAN

00:24:31.236 --> 00:24:31.970
EXCEED THE MEDIAN.

00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:34.873
SO UNTIL THAT IS IS CHANGING

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.841
EVEN WE PROBABLY BE CONTENT IF

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:37.242
THE IF WE WERE LIMITED TO THE

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:38.877
STATEWIDE MEDIAN AS OPPOSED TO

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.713
JUST OUR LOCAL MEDIA -- BECAUSE

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.449
YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES WE ARE

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:45.684
RATE IT DOESN'T ISN'T ENOUGH FOR

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.785
ON PEOPLE TO HIRE PEOPLE AT

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:48.587
MINIMUM WAGE MUCH LESS PAY

00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:51.289
BENEFITS -- OR HAVE THEIR OWN

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:53.291
OVERHEAD COVERAGE SO -- LIKE

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:55.026
WITH THE SEEK ISSUE YOU KNOW WE

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:56.228

00:32:51.436 --> 00:32:53.237
NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:55.373
APPEAL PROCESS IS IS -- TO MAKE

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.177
SURE THAT UP WE WERE -- VETTED --

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.045
ENTIRELY AS IT RELATES TO THE

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:02.280
SERVICES THAT WERE SEEKING OUT

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:03.815
WOULD YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT

00:33:03.881 --> 00:33:04.882
THAT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE FOR

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:05.983
THOSE THAT ARE HERE THE THOSE

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.719

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:09.987
LOOKS LIKE.

00:33:10.054 --> 00:33:10.688
THE ONE ON THE FOR YOU OUR

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:12.724
INTERNAL STRUCTURE IS PROBABLY

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:13.624
THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT THAT

00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:15.560
POINT WHEN SOMEBODY GOES THROUGH

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:16.427
IN TANKER COMES YOU'RE FROM

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:17.462
ANOTHER ARIAN IS ASSIGNED A CASE

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:18.363
MANAGER.

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:20.298
IN FACT IN THE PAST WE USED TO

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:21.666
REQUIRE THAT EVERYBODY BE SEEN

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:24.402
QUARTERLY -- AND BECAUSE OF THE

00:33:24.469 --> 00:33:27.271
GROWTH THE END INCREASES AND

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:29.040
DEMANDS OF WHAT THEY NEEDED TO

00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:30.808
DO AND BECAUSE OF OUR GROWTH

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:33.745
HERE -- WE MADE.

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.646

REQUIRING EVERY QUARTER.

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:42.487
BUT WE WENT BACK TO THE FIFTH IF

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:44.322
THE FAMILY FELT THAT ONE YEAR

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:45.823
ONCE YOU'RE WAS OKAY THEN THAT'S

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.292
THAT'S OKAY -- WE WOULD LIKE IN

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:48.926
FACT I'VE BEEN GOING AROUND A

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:50.228
MEETING WITH THE DIFFERENT UNITS

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:51.262

EVERY FRIDAY OR WHATEVER.

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:56.134
IN CALLING FAMILIES AND THAT

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.168
THEY HAVEN'T TALKED TO IN

WORKER AND THAT KIND OF THING

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:08.513
JUST TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:09.013
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BUILD

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.548
RELATIONSHIPS IN A YEAR.

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:11.749
BUT THE CASE MANAGERS BECAUSE OF

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:12.817
OUR GROWTH WE CHANGE CASE LAWS

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:13.651

EACH UNIT HAS ANYWHERE FROM

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.030
ABOUT FIFTEEN TO ADMIT EVEN

DISTRICT THERE ARE UNIQUE --

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:45.349
CHALLENGES TO THIS PARTICULAR

00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:46.350
DISTRICT THAT DON'T EXIST IN

00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:48.518
OTHER PARTS OF A CALIFORNIA THAT

I MEET WITH FAMILIES THE FIRST

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.226
THING THAT STRIKES ME IS THAT

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:57.294
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHO

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:57.961
REGIONAL CENTER IS?

00:49:58.028 --> 00:49:59.830
THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

00:49:59.896 --> 00:50:00.697
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO

WHERE THEY COME FROM IT'S JUST A

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:17.127
VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT TO NOT

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:18.395
ONLY DEALING WITH THE DISABILITY

00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:20.030

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:53.964
ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.966
I JUST THINK TO ATTACK -- WAY

00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:56.900
TOO MANY HAVE STATED I THINK THE

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:57.968
ACCESSIBILITY PART IS IS

00:53:58.034 --> 00:53:59.869
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN OUR

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:00.804
COMMUNITY.

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.739
AND WHAT I WOULD URGE THIS

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:03.807
COMMITTEE TO TO THINK ABOUT

00:54:03.873 --> 00:54:06.576
RESPECTFULLY IS IS ALSO THE THE

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:07.744
ASPECTS OF CULTURAL SENSITIVITY

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:09.679
AND KEEPING IN MIND THAT A LOT

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.414
OF OUR FAMILIES SOMETIMES LIVE

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:12.582
IN FEAR BECAUSE OF THE

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:13.249
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:54:13.316 --> 00:54:15.352
ARE THE POLITICAL CLIMATE --

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:16.286
THAT THEY'RE FACED WITH AND IT'S

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:18.188
VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:20.123
REALLY HAVE -- CONNECTIONS AND I

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.925
THINK THAT THE REASON WHY WE'VE

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:24.094
BEEN -- HEADED TOWARDS A A MORE

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.161
SUCCESSFUL PATH IS BECAUSE I

00:54:25.228 --> 00:54:26.196
THINK WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND

00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:27.964
WE'RE WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:29.966
MAKE THAT HAPPEN -- FOR US TO TO

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:31.701
HAVE THAT FEASIBILITY THE

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:34.537
ACCESSIBILITY AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:38.575
THAT HAVING MORE INROADS IN THAT

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:41.411
DIRECTION WOULD BE HELPFUL.

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:42.512
THE JUST REGARDS TO THE

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:43.513
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SCHOOL

IN -- AND RENOVATING FACILITIES

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:55.925
THAT THERE COULD BE -- A VIABLE

00:54:55.992 --> 00:54:57.927

THIS TYPE OF RESOLUTION BE --

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:25.922
FUNDING MECHANISM THAT COULD ADD

THERE IN A CLASSROOM THAT

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:01.690
DOESN'T HAVE A KITCHEN SETTING

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:04.426
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE USE THAT ARE.

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:07.429
COOKTOP ENACT CAMPING SINK TO

REHAB AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:24.679
BECAUSE THE TEACHER SHOULDN'T

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:25.280
HAVE TO GO OUT AND FIND THESE

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:26.615
JOBS.

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:28.583
AND THEY DO AND NOW THE TEACHERS

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:29.484
ARE HAVING TO GET TERRITORIAL

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:32.387
ABOUT WHERE THE JOBS ARE WHICH

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:33.588

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:34.623
WHERE I'VE ALSO BEEN HEARING

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.391

TO SCHOOL SITES IN THE DISTRICT?

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:43.164
SO IT'S AT THEIR INDIA TYPICAL

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.332
EDUCATION CENTERS LIKE IN YOUR

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:46.001

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:48.970
INTEGRATED WITH THE STUDENTS.

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:50.805
NOW THE DISTRICT IS TALKING

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:51.473
ABOUT PUTTING THEM IN A SEPARATE

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:53.808
SETTING WAY OFF IN THE BOWELS OF

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.777
INDIA AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED --

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:57.812
AGAIN THERE'S NO KITCHEN THERE I

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:58.680
DON'T KNOW WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.715
WHAT THE BENEFIT OF MOVING THEM

01:22:00.782 --> 01:22:01.549
WOULD BE.

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:02.550
THEY'VE THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:03.385
IT'S GOING TO BE MORE LIKE

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:05.387
COLLEGE SETTING BUT IF THEY WANT

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:06.488
TO COLLEGE SETTING WE HAVE A

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:12.193
BEAUTIFUL COD CAMPUS OUT HERE

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:12.761
WHY CAN'T WE MOVE THEM OVER

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:13.128
THERE.

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:14.996
SO WE'RE JUST VERY DISAPPOINTED

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.131
IN THIS ADULT PROGRAM IT'S

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.299
SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADULT TRAINING

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:18.233
PROGRAM AND DOLE TRANSITION

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:18.967
PROGRAM.

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:19.801
AND I JUST FEEL THE TEACHERS

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:21.803
JUST DO NOT GET THE SUPPORT THAT

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.072
THEY NEED FROM THE DISTRICT AND

01:22:24.139 --> 01:22:28.710
IT'S A SHAME [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:31.446
ABOUT THAT.

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:34.416
THE DISTRICT HAS NOT CONTACTED

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:36.284
APPEARANCE THEY HAVEN'T EVEN

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:38.320
CONTACTED THAN ADULTS I MEAN I

01:22:38.386 --> 01:22:40.121
CHILDREN THEY'RE ADULTS.

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.190
AND THEY HAVE RIGHTS IN WE HAVE

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:44.059
RIGHTS THEY HAVEN'T ASKED US

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:44.659
ANYTHING WE'RE HEARING THROUGH

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:45.393
THE GRAPEVINE THAT THEY'VE

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:46.394
ALREADY FILLED IS STILL TO MOVE

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:47.929
THEM.

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:49.831
AND TRANSITION THE LECTURE.

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:51.032
SO IT AFFECTS THEIR JOB SITES IT

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.167
AFFECTS THEIR TRANSPORTATION

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:53.702
IT'S NOT IN THE BEST AREA THAT'S

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:55.670
NOT MY BIGGEST CONCERN BUT THE

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.672
TEACHERS JUST HEARING FROM THE

01:22:57.739 --> 01:22:58.907

01:22:58.973 --> 01:22:59.541
MOVE.

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:00.775
BUT THEY FEEL THEY HAVE NO

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:06.481
CHOICE AND THEY FEEL THEY HAVE

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:09.317

ON THE THE ROAD TO BEING

01:57:42.255 --> 01:57:43.856
FINISHED IT'S A COLLABORATION

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:44.824
BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF
