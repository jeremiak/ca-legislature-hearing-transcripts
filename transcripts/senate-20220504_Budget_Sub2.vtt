00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:21.234
ABOUT THE CDC'S PRIMARY FUNDING

STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. ARE YOU SOME

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.375
OF YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS LAST

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.044
YEAR. THE REASON IS DEMAND FOR

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.211
THE SERVICES OF THE ENERGY

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:33.580
COMMISSION OF INCREASING

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:35.348
STEADILY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.251
YEARS INDEED IN THE LAST DECADE.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.053
THE LEGISLATURE STATUS-

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.789
APPROVED. OVER SEVENTY NEW

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.792
POSITIONS FUNDED BY- AND WE'RE

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.393
ORGANIZATION ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.128
SUCH A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:50.997
SIMULTANEOUSLY THE OPRAH

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.433
REVENUES THAT WE RELY ON AS ONE

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.101
OF OUR SHE FUNDING SOURCES BY

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:56.736
FAR OUR LARGEST HAVE BEEN

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:59.172
DECLINING. AND WE'D TO

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:00.506
CHARACTERIZE THIS AS ARE BEING

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.675
VICTIMS OF OUR OWN SUCCESS

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.243
BECAUSE THIS URBAN DECLINE IS

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.612
CHIEFLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO TWO

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.981
FACTORS THE FIRST IS BEHIND THE

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:12.518
METER- GROWTH- SOLAR IS CHIEF

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.320
AMONG THE RESOURCES THAT

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:16.889
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. AND WE'RE UP

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:20.293
TO TODAY ABOUT TWELVE GIGAWATTS

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.228
OF ROOF TOP SOLAR WHICH IS A

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.730
REALLY REMARKABLE DEVELOP.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:27.500
SECOND BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS-

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.135
SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER ON A PER

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:31.404
CAPITA BASIS THAN OTHER STATES

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.640
IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF. IN

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:35.675
TERMS OF ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:39.545
. AND THAT'S IN PART DUE TO THE

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.248
BUILDING CODES AND THE CLIENT

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.450
CODES THAT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.387
COMMISSION ADOPTS SO WHEN WE-

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.288
RATCHET DOWN THE AMOUNT OF

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.524
ENERGY THAT CAN BE CONSUMED BY

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:52.959
BUILDINGS THAT THEN DEPRESSES

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.827
THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY WE USE

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.396
WHICH IS GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:57.797
GREAT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE BUT IT

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.866
IT DOES IMPACT OUR REVENUES

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.901
SIMILARLY IN THE APPLIANCES I.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.803
JUST GIVING EXAMPLE TELEVISIONS

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.038
FROM YEARS AGO WERE IN A

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.472
FINANCIAL WE IMPOSED

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.908
REQUIREMENTS ON INDUSTRY TO.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.376
DECREASE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.945
FROM THOSE DEVICES AND THE

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.248
SAVINGS REMARKABLE EACH TV WE

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.583
ESTIMATED WOULD SAVE CONSUMERS

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.018
FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS PER YEAR AND

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:21.254
REDUCE ENERGY EXPENDITURES AND

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.156
WE HAVE SPENT ON A TEN YEAR

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.757
LIFESPAN FOR TELEVISION SO ABOUT

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.259
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:27.760
SAVINGS WHICH FAR OUTSTRIPS THE

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.896
VERY MARGINAL COST ADDITIONAL

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:32.265
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PUTTING

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.868
THINGS INTO DEVICES THAT REDUCE

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.737
THE ENERGY THAT THEY- YOUR- THE

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.372
- BEHIND ME. AND THE IF. HAVE

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.674
DRAMATICALLY REDUCED ELECTRICITY

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.010
CONSUMPTION AND THIS IS WHAT HAS

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.912
LED TO OUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:47.080
WOULD HAVE KEPT US AFLOAT IS

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.048
THAT WE'VE HAD IN OUR BALANCE

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.883
THAT WE'VE BEEN USING AS THERE'S

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.618
A DELTA BETWEEN WHAT THE

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.287
LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATE WHAT WE

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.255
STAND AND THEN WHAT WE BRING IN

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.658
TRUE- BUT- THEY SPEND DIFFERENT

00:05:58.725 --> 00:05:59.826
HEATING IS GOING FOR A WHILE. IN

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:01.461
ADDITION WE'VE BEEN VERY FRUGAL

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:02.795
THE LAST SEVERAL BUDGET CYCLES

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:06.099
WE HAVE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF-

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.533
PRESS ON- BUT BY THIRTY SEVEN

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.836
MILLION DOLLARS. OF THAT ABOUT

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:12.705
TWENTY IS FROM FUNDS- FUND

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:15.241
SHIFTED TO OTHER ACCOUNTS AND

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.610
SIXTEEN POINT THREE MILLION IS

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:19.545
FROM ACTUAL CITIES WOULD JUST

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:20.947
MADE CUTS AND I'LL GIVE YOU. A

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.915
QUICK EXAMPLE WE MOVED TO A NEW

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.384
BUILDING AND SUBSTANTIALLY

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:26.385
REDUCE OUR FOOTPRINT AS A

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:28.855
CONSEQUENCE WE ARE SAVING. OVER

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:31.124
ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.793
RENT. A SECOND. ISSUE I'VE SITE

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.862
IS SOON AFTER THE PANDEMIC HIT

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:38.097
IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY WE

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:39.832
DECIDED IT MADE SENSE TO

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.334
ELIMINATE OUR LANDLINE. WE ARE

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.535
STAFFED WITH FLIP PHONES

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:43.936
INEXPENSIVELY PHONES ARE VERY

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:46.773
INEXPENSIVE PLANS THAT IS SAVING

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.174
US OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.376
DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR AN AGENCY

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:56.749
OF. ABOUT REAL. QUICKLY- I'M A

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.384
YOU HAVE ON YOUR THE SAN. WE

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.019
WANT JUST I WANT TO GO THROUGH

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.355
VERY BRIEFLY WHAT ARE PROPOSAL

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:02.989
IS IN THE BUDGET. IT WOULD WE

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:05.091
WOULD DO THREE THINGS THE FIRST

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:07.593
IS TO EXTEND THE- SURCHARGE TO.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.395
BEHIND THE METER CONSUMPTION AS

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:11.464
NOTED EARLIER THIS THE ONLY THE

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:14.167
ONLY- CONSUMPTION THAT THE

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:15.902
CHARGES APPLIED AGAINST IS THAT

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:18.037
WHICH IS NEATER. IF WE EXTENDED

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.206
TO BY THE METER TYPICALLY SOLAR

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.340
THAT WILL GENERATE SIGNIFICANT

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:25.077
REVENUE. AND- BRING BRING THEM

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:26.412
IN LINE WITH EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.014
WHO'S BEEN PAYING THAT CHARGE BY

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.782
THE WAY THE AMOUNT. ON AVERAGE

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.652
PER RATEPAYER IS EIGHTEEN CENTS.

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.887
PER MONTH THAT'S HOW MUCH IT

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.455
COSTS TO FUND THE ENERGY

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:38.591
COMMISSION TROOP- BUT OBVIOUSLY

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:40.893
IF YOU'RE A VERY LARGE ENERGY

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.895
CONSUMER IT CAN COST MORE THAN

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.497
THAT BUT- BRIDGES EIGHT. CENTS

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.566
PER MONTH PER. METER SECOND PART

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.534
THE PROPOSAL IS TO RAISE THE

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.203
STATUTORY CAPSULE RIGHT NOW THE

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.638
STE THE STATUTE CAPS THE

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:55.007
SURCHARGE EIGHT POINT ZERO ZERO

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:58.077
ZERO THREE- CENTS PER. KILOWATT

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:01.347
HOUR OR THREE TENTHS OF ONE MILL

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.648
WE WOULD PROPOSE TO RAISE THAT

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:04.383
CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORT THE

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.885
SENATE REQUESTED FROM THE SENATE

OFFICE OFFICE OF RESEARCH TWO

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.289
POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO FIVE FIVE.

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:11.991
WHICH THE REPORT NOTED WOULD BE

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.392
ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD BE IF WE

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:15.027
HAD INDEXED THIS ONE TO

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:15.995
INFLATION- WHEN ENERGY

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:20.800
COMMISSION. RESET RIGHT NOW WE

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:23.102
ONLY CAN INCREASE AT THAT WOULD

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.604
INCREASE THE CAP. THE ENERGY

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.706
COMMISSION HAS TO MAKE AN ACTUAL

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.841
INCREASE TO THE RATE AND WE HAVE

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:30.509
TO DO IT A PUBLICLY NOTICED

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.211
MEANING AND IT'S ONLY ALLOWED-

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.146
IN IN THE IN THE MONTH OF

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:35.314
NOVEMBER SO WE WOULD WE'VE DONE

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.916
THAT A COUPLE TIMES OVER THE

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:38.217
YEARS. THAT WOULD BE THE

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:40.620
MECHANISM TO DO THAT AND- AND

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:41.254
ANALLY WE WOULD TIE THE STATURE

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.989
CAP TO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:44.891
SO WE DIDN'T. IT TO INFLATION.

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:46.359
IN CLOSING WE JUST SAY THAT WE

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.461
BELIEVE THIS IS AN ACTUAL

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:49.095
INVESTMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS. HE

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.330
IT EIGHTEEN CENTS PER MONTH THE

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:52.465
SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.800
BUILDING STANDARDS AND THE

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.669
APPLIANCE STANDARDS AND

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:59.305
EVERYBODY'S GOT CHARGERS.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.307
COMPUTERS COMMITTEE. WE RETURN

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.242
TO THE RAY PAYERS WHO FUND US

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.912
MORE THAN THEY PAY MORE MORE

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:08.347
THAN A PACK SO WE BELIEVE THAT

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:09.949
MAKES OUR INVESTMENT SOUND WHAT

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.517
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OF

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:12.652
COURSE I WILL BUY QUESTIONS

THANK YOU MISTER BROWN WITH THE

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:16.889
L. A. SHOULD WE- GET RID OF ALL

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:17.890
THE LAND LINES OVER AT THE L.

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:21.227
LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE TO

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:22.962
GIVE YOU A FLIP PHONE AND SAVE

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:28.367
SOME. I NOT SURE A COMMENT ON

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:31.704
PARTICULAR FOLDER RIGHT NOW WILL

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:33.639
. BAKER MAYBE ABOUT THAT THE

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:36.342
BIBLE. I SO BUT WE DO HAVE SOME

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.743
ON THE- THE PER ON THE ISSUE OF

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.679
THAT DIRECTOR BOW HAND TALK

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:42.114
ABOUT JUST NOW- SOMEONE RUN

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.849
THROUGH THAT QUICK I THINK FOR

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:46.319
OFF. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:49.455
DO A THAT THERE CURRENTLY IS A-

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:50.089
ANNUAL DEATH IN THE FUN IN THAT

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.190
LEGISLATIVE ACTION BE NEEDED TO

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.625
PREVENT INSOLVENCY SOMETIME IN

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:55.361
THE COMING YEARS- HOWEVER WE DO

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.063
THINK. THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.364
FACTORS THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.665
CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING JUST

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:00.866
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM AND

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.702
WHEN ACTION IS NEEDED- ONE OF

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.303
THEM SHORT TERM AND ONE OF THEM

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.739
MORE LONG TERM. SO I'M NOT SHORT

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:09.775
TERM SIDE- THE WE WANTED TO KNOW

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:10.676
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:12.645
THAT THE FUND WON'T GO INSOLVENT

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:15.581
UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:16.148
TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S A FEW

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:19.085
YEARS NOW SO AS RESULTS.

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:20.920
IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADDRESS THAT

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.521
THE DEFICIT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:24.724
NECESSARY- THIS YEAR. IT'S ALSO

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.392
WORTH NOTING THAT- THE

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.160
ADMINISTRATION. HAS NOT YET

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:30.796
PROVIDED A DETAILED KIND OF FIVE

00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:33.466
YEAR OR A PROJECTION OF THE FUND

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:34.967
CONDITION- FIRST SORT OF A FEW

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:36.435
YEARS THE ON THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:37.837
OTHER AS A RESULT THERE

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:39.505
CONTINUES TO BE SOME UNCERTAINTY

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:41.307
ABOUT. WHEN THE FIND EXACTLY

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:44.443
WHAT WOULD GO INSOLVENT- I'M

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.512
MORE OF THAT OF LONG TERM-

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:48.447
ISSUES AND KIND OF CONDITION OF

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:49.915
THE FUNDS. THE OTHER ISSUE I

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:52.918
WANTED FLAG IS- AVENUES ARE

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:54.954
PROJECTED TO GROW I'M GOING

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.722
FORWARD EVEN BUYING A BY THE

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:57.890
ENERGY COMMISSION AND BOTH ARE

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:00.259
GOING TO MAKE CASE AND HIGH CASE

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.527
SCENARIOS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:04.930
- SHARKS IN YOUR AGENDA- ON PAGE

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:05.831
TWENTY ONE THAT SORT OF. YOU

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:07.633
KNOW SHOWS SOME OF THOSE.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.968
PROJECTIONS IN SORT OF THE

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.636
GROWTH OF SALES GOING FORWARD

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:11.771
THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO. A STATE

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:12.938
EFFORTS AROUND ELECTRIFICATION

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.640
OF TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDINGS

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:16.909
WHICH IS- TALK ABOUT OF COURSE

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:19.445
IN PREVIOUSHEARINGS- AND SO AS

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.946
A RESULT EVEN KIND OF GETTING

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.681
OUT SOME OF THE ROADS AND-

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:24.483
DISTRIBUTE GENERATION- THE

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.285
GROWTH IN KIND OF. A RETAIL

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.054
SALES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.055
GOING FORWARD SO THE DEGREE TO

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:31.057
WHICH- A LONG TERM INCREASE IN

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:32.358
THE SURCHARGE RATE IS NEEDED IS

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:33.759
ALSO A BIT UNCLEAR AS REVENUE.

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.528
FROM INCREASING SALES COULD AT

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:37.196
LEAST PARTIALLY. ELIMINATE THE

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.832
FUNDS I DEFICIT. SO WITHOUT

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.100
THOSE KIND OF PIECES IN CONTEXT

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.668
IN MIND WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:44.003
HAS SOME DIFFERENT OPTIONS IT

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.505
COULD CONSIDER HERE- FIRST YOU

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:47.740
KNOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:48.707
CONSIDER REJECTING THE

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:50.209
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS THIS

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:51.944
YEAR THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR. BUT

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:54.447
IT OPS ARE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:55.614
REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES

00:11:55.681 --> 00:12:00.553
ADMINISTRATION. DATE ON THE-

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:01.454
NEXT YEAR INCLUDING. THE PROJECT

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.956
OF THE LONG. REVENUE IN CAR. AND

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:05.758
THIS COULD BE TO AND- YEARS A

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.226
LOT. ADOPTED TYPE OF REQUIREMENT

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:09.161
. AND THAT INFORMATION COULD

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.362
ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE K. TO

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:11.430
CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:14.300
CONDITION OF THE FUNDING TAKE

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:15.468
TAKE ACTION AS NECESSARY.

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:17.269
ALTERNATIVELY ALTERNATIVELY IF

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:19.038
THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO MAKE

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:20.239
CHANGES AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:21.507
BUDGET COULD YOU CONSIDER

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.042
ADOPTING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:23.976
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:26.545
REJECTING OTHERS SO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:27.513
IN OUR VIEW EXTENDING THE

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.782
SURCHARGE TO BEHIND THE METER

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:31.450
CONSUMPTION COULD HELP ENSURE.

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:32.485
REVENUES COLLECTED MORE

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:35.154
EQUITABLY ACROSS ALL ENERGY

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:36.889
CONSUMERS AND SO WE THINK. ALSO

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:38.324
CANADA AS ANOTHER PIECE OF THE

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.359
PROPOSAL THINK CHINA SURCHARGE

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.827
TO INFLATION IS A REASONABLE

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:43.729
STRATEGY TO ENSURE. FUTURE

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.197
REVENUES SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:47.433
GROWTH SPENDING- BASELINE COST

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.301
LIKE BROKEN SALARIES AND

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:51.704
BENEFITS FOR CDC STAFF. AND BOTH

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:52.938
OF THESE CASES BUT THE BEHIND

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:55.207
THE METER AND THAT TRYING TO

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:56.208
INFLATION WE THINK THERE'SA

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:57.042
CLEAR POLICY IN FISCAL RATIONALE

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.911
FOR MAKING THOSE CHANGES- THE

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:00.479
LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:02.882
OTHER OPTIONS THAT ROUTE REDUCE

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:05.417
URBAN SPENDING SUCH AS- SHIFTING

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:06.719
SOME OF THE COST IS ABOUT ONE

00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.387
POINT THREE MILLION. IN COSTS

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:09.955
RELATED TO THE EPIC PROGRAM

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:12.625
WHICH COULD BE SHIFTED TO A

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:13.726
DIFFERENT FUND AND- S. ARE A

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.427
PART OF THE ISSUE- SO THERE ARE

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:16.996
A- VARIETY OF OTHER.

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:18.297
ALTERNATIVES AND OPTIONS

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.733
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER- SO

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:22.835
JUST TO WRAP UP I GUESS OUR

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:23.936
OVERALL COMMENTS WE DO THINK

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:26.238
THERE ARE- OR SOME KIND OF A

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:27.006
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE URGENCY

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.140
NEEDED IN THE SHORT TERM AND THE

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:29.775
LONG TERM MAGNITUDE OF THE

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:32.144
PROBLEM- AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:34.180
COULD HAVE A- HAS A FEW

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:35.848
DIFFERENT- ALTERNATE. EXPLORE

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:38.951
YOU KNOW. PACKAGE OR IN SOME

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:40.052
FUTURE YEAR SO IN MY COMMENTS

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:41.921
THERE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.856
QUESTIONS YOU QUOTE LET ME ASK

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:45.391
YOU QUESTIONS BECAUSE I DIDN'T.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:46.926
REALIZED UNTIL IT CAME TO CHAIR

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.961
HERE WHETHER MALE IS AND WHAT

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:50.930
THE HUNDREDTH OF A MALE IS ON

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:52.932
THE ELECTRICAL RATES BUT IS THE

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:53.933
STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT YOU

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.101
KNOW. ONCE UPON A TIME WE SET

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:59.205
THE RATE AT A- ONE MILL AND THEN

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:01.340
INTO TWENTY YEARS AGO WE GAVE

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:03.676
THEM AUTHORITY TO GO TO. YOU

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:06.445
KNOW TO BILLS OR TO THREE MALES

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.380
RIGHT IN IN THE COURSE OF TWENTY

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:11.450
YEARS WE'VE SEEN THAT.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.652
ADJUSTMENT THERE ARE. IF THEY

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:14.653
DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.021
RECEIVE A DEFICIT OR REACHING

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:19.058
DEFICIT TOLL TWENTY FOUR TWENTY
