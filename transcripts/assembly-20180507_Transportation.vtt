AUTOMATED VEHICLES ARE SAFER

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:27.119
THAN HUMAN DRIVER.

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:27.920
DESPITE THE HIGH NUMBERS OF

WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS NEW

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:10.561
ISSUES ARISE. SAFETY IS

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:11.796
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:13.264
THE OUR PATROL TRAFFIC SAFETY ON

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:15.066
THE ROADWAYS AND THAT'S THE LENS

00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:15.566
THROUGH WHICH WE LOOK AT

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:16.734
EVERYTHING.

00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:18.936
AND SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:20.104
THOUGH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT FACES

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:22.173
NOT ONLY CHP BUT CERTAINLY OUR

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:23.741
LOCAL ALLIED AGENCY PARTNERS.

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:24.875
WHO WILL PROBABLY BE

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:27.044
EXPERIENCING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:29.447
MORE THAN CHP OFFICERS FRANKLY

00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:31.115
ARE OR THE UNCERTAINTY OF THIS

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:32.216
NEW TECHNOLOGY?

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:34.018
HOW IT'S BEING USED?

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:36.187
IT'S SO RAPID AND IT'S RAPIDLY

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:37.822
DEVELOPING AND IT'S IT'S

00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:38.889
FOR A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:39.790
OFFICERS OUT THERE ON THE ROAD

00:37:39.857 --> 00:37:40.958
THEY DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:43.260
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY.

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:44.295
ANOTHER BIG CHALLENGE IS A

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:46.030
STATUTORY CHALLENGES

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.198
PHIL TALK ABOUT EACH OF THESE IN

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.399
TURN FIRST FALL WITH WITH

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:50.267
RESPECT TO THE UNCERTAINTY.

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:51.636
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW WE

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:53.004
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WHAT IS

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.572
GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT IT WHAT ARE

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:55.873
THEY ALLOWED TO DO?

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.375
WHAT ARE THEY REQUIRED TO DO ON

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:59.143
THE ROADWAYS WHAT DOES LAW

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.945
ENFORCEMENT DO IF THEY IN IRAQ

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:02.279
ONE OF THESE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:03.247
AS A RESULT OF THE CALL OF A

00:38:03.314 --> 00:38:04.715
COLLISION? OR MAYBE AN

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:06.117
ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY HOW THEY

00:38:06.183 --> 00:38:07.418
HANDLE THAT.

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:08.653
CERTAINLY THE HIGHWAY PATROL

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:09.587
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING SO

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.188
CLOSELY WITH THE DMV WE HAVE A

00:38:11.255 --> 00:38:12.556
GOOD SENSE OF THE NEW REGULATORY

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:13.991
STRUCTURE BUT ARE A LOT OF

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:15.693
RALLIED AGENCY PARTNERS DON'T.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.527
IT'S WHITE HEARINGS LIKE THIS I

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.462
THINK ARE SO CRUCIAL FOR THE LAW

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:19.096
ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY CERTAINLY

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.531
HERE.

00:38:20.598 --> 00:38:21.666
IN COORDINATION WITH THE AND WE

00:38:21.732 --> 00:38:22.967
WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.468
WITH OUR ALLIED AGENCY PARTNERS

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:26.237
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:27.438
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.340
HAPPENING WITH THE EIGHTIES.

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:30.574
WHAT IS COMING AND OTHER SCHOOLS

NOW THE OTHER BIG CHALLENGE WE

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:17.174
HAD THAT I REFERENCED IS A

WE THINK WE HAVE.

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:39.930
.

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:41.732
VERY GOOD APPLICATION WE CAN

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:43.400
ENSURE TRAFFIC SAFETY BY GETTING

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:09.980
CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO

00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:11.181
ALREADY HAVE COMPANIES TESTING

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:12.549

NOW AND IT'S ON THE GROUNDS.

00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:26.096
PROPOSED FEDERAL LEGISLATION

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:26.797
COULD ALLOW THE EACH

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.032
MANUFACTURER DEPLOY UP TO EIGHTY

00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:29.767

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:32.669
MANY OF WHICH WE EXPECT IN URBAN

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:35.339
AREAS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO.

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:36.340
TODAY PUBLIC ATTENTION

IS FOCUSED ON THE VEHICLE ITSELF.

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:41.311
MORE THOUGHT MUST BE GIVEN TO

00:44:41.378 --> 00:44:42.246
THE ENVIRONMENT OF THESE

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:43.747
VEHICLES WILL OPERATE AND AND

THAT'S OF MTA IS CHARGED WITH

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:02.966
OVERSEEING A SAFE EFFECTIVE AND

WE SUPPORT INNOVATION AND

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.371
BELIEVES AND THE LONG TERM

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:08.806
AUTOMATION CAN REALLY HELP

00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:09.406
REDUCE A LOT OF THE DANGEROUS

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:10.407
DRIVING BEHAVIORS THAT WE SEE ON

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:12.142
THE STREETS.

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.577
AB IS COMMITTED TO HELP US

00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:15.245

FATALITIES ON CITY STREETS. AS

00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:23.353
WELL AS OUR TRANSIT FIRST POLICY

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.322
WHICH PRIORITIZES MASS TRANSIT

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:27.357
WALKING AND BIKING OVER SINGLE

OCCUPANCY VEHICLE TRIPS.

00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:30.928
WE SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:32.563
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES BUT ONLY IF

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:34.398
REGULATED CORRECTLY.

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.532
A PROACTIVE STATE AND LOCAL

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:37.234
GOVERNMENT ROLE IN SAFEGUARDING

00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:39.403
THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS CRUCIAL.

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:40.671
WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF AB IS

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:41.405
ON OUR STREETS.

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:43.140
OPPOSES A VARIETY OF ISSUES FOR

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:44.775
A CITY MUST BUT A CITY MUST

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:45.976
CONSIDER BUT TODAY WILL FOCUS ON

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:47.377
SAFETY.

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:49.012
THE TRAGIC FATALITY IN ARIZONA

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:49.646
HAS BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO THE

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:51.648
FRONT OF ALL OF OUR MINDS.

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:52.850
AND THE REALITY THAT A THESE ARE

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.218
NOT A SILVER BULLET TO SAFETY

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:55.486
WITHOUT FURTHER TESTING AND

00:45:55.552 --> 00:45:56.353
THOUGHTFUL REGULATION HAS BECOME

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.755
APPARENT.

00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:00.124
WITH A POTENTIALLY SWIFT PACE OF

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.358
INTRODUCTION OF EIGHTIES ON OUR

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:02.726
CITY STREETS WE BELIEVE THE

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:03.694
MANUFACTURERS NEED TO WORK

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.028
CLOSELY WITH CITIES TO ENSURE

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.430
THAT THE FIRST AB IS DEPLOYED

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:07.965
WILL SAFELY INTERACT WITH OTHER

00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:09.733
ROAD USERS. INCLUDED IN PUBLIC

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.735
TRANSIT VEHICLES AND PEOPLE

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:12.269
WALKING AND BIKING ON OUR

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:13.737
STREETS.

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:14.538
DURING THE PERIOD WHERE

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.406
AUTONOMOUS AND NON AUTONOMOUS

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:18.075
VEHICLES SHARE THE STREET. AB IS

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.476
MUST BE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:20.744
THE NEIGHBORHOOD CONTACTS AND

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:21.945
SHOULD WORK WITH CITIES TO

00:46:22.012 --> 00:46:23.447
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AREAS

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:25.849
FOR TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT.

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:27.351
TODAY ANSWER NAY LINGERS AROUND

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:29.253
THREE CRITICAL REGULATORY ISSUES

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:29.820
RELATED TO SAFETY THAT OFFER

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:31.588
THEIR DISCUSS.

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:32.256
THE FIRST IS MAINTAINING CONTROL

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:34.224
OF OUR LOCAL STREETS.

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:35.292
THE SECOND IS DEVELOPING

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:36.393
EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.262
INTERACTION PLANS AND THE THIRD

00:46:38.328 --> 00:46:39.396
IS ACCESS TO DATA ABOUT HOW

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:40.531
ATHEISTS WILL OPERATE ON CITY

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:42.799
STREETS.

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:43.634
IT'S CRITICAL THE CITY'S

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.402
MAINTAIN LOCAL CONTROL OF OUR

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:46.904
STREETS EVEN A THREE RELY ON THE

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.272
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SET AB

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:49.740
DESIGN OPERATION AND PERFORMANCE

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.141
STANDARDS.

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:52.309
WITH THE CURRENT FEDERAL

00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:53.744
LEGISLATION DISCUSSED HERE TODAY

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.012
ON CITIES AND STATES COULD BE

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:56.747
PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL RULES AND

00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:58.415
COULD LOSE THE ABILITY TO

00:46:58.482 --> 00:46:59.049
ENFORCE THE BASIC RULES OF THE

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:01.051
ROAD. THIS COULD CREATE A ONE

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:02.653
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO A. B.

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.188
TECHNOLOGY ACROSS THE COUNTRY OF

00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:05.522
THAT LACK SENSITIVITY TO LOCAL

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:07.191
CONTACTS.

00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:08.525
TO GIVE THE LOCAL EXAMPLE IN SAN

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:10.093
FRANCISCO IT IS AGAINST THE LAW

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.094
TO DRIVE THROUGH A CROSSWALK

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:13.096
ONCE PEDESTRIAN HAS ENTERED.

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:14.231
RECENTLY A CRUISE VEHICLE

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:15.499
OPERATING IN AUTONOMOUS MODE

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:16.667
WITH THE TEST DRIVER WAS

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:17.834
TICKETED FOR DRIVING THROUGH A

00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:19.203
CROSSWALK AFTER A PEDESTRIAN HAD

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:20.938
ALREADY ENTERED.

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:22.272
LUCKILY THE AV DID NOT HIT THE

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:23.874
PERSON CROSSING THE STREET.

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:25.509
HOWEVER THE FACT REMAINS THAT IN

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:26.910
AB WAS NOT PROGRAMMED TO.

00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:27.911
TO FOLLOW OUR LOCAL TRAFFIC

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:29.213
LAWS

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:30.480
AND TO ENSURE THAT SAM CISCO

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:32.216
REMAINS A SAFE CITY FOR ALL ROAD

00:47:32.282 --> 00:47:34.084
USERS INCLUDING THOSE LOCKED

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:34.651
LAWFULLY WALKING ACROSS THE

00:47:34.718 --> 00:47:36.386
STREET. WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE

00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:37.688
SURE THAT INCIDENTS LIKE THIS DO

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:39.523
NOT CONTINUE AND THAT IF YOU

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.758
FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE ROAD.

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:42.793
SECOND WE NEED TO ENSURE CLEAR

00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:44.094
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AB

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:44.761
MANUFACTURES AND FIRST

00:47:44.828 --> 00:47:46.363
RESPONDERS.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.764
IT'S ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTELY

00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:49.099
ESSENTIAL THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:50.367
AND FIRST RESPONDERS AND KNOW

00:47:50.434 --> 00:47:51.868
HOW TO INTERACT WITH AB IS IN

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:52.903
THE EVENT OF A TRAFFIC INCIDENT

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.304
OR COLLISION.

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.540
FOR EXAMPLE ONE AB RECOGNIZE

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:57.574
WHEN A POLICE OFFICER IS PULLING

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:58.875
IT OVER. HOW WILL THE FIRST

00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:00.043
RESPOND OR KNOW WHO TO CALL IN

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:01.411
THERE'S A COLLISION WHO WILL

00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:02.312
PICK UP THE PHONE ON THE OTHER

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:03.614
AND AND WHERE WILL THEY BE

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.715
LOCATED?

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:05.782
WILL THEY HAVE A REAL TIME

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:07.084
CONTROL OVER THE AB.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.818
THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:08.952
QUESTIONS THAT CURRENTLY REMAIN

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:11.021
UNANSWERED.

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:12.089
WERE ENCOURAGED TO THE DMV

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:13.890
REGULATIONS FOR DRIVERLESS AB

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:14.391
PERMITS.

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:15.459
REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURERS TO

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:17.761
SUBMIT THESE PLAN.

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:18.695
THE REGULATIONS ARE GOOD START

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:19.997
BUT WE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:21.598
CAN BE FURTHER STRENGTHENED.

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:22.799
IT'S INCREASINGLY CLEAR THE

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:24.434
EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL PLANS

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:25.669
MUST BE JOINTLY DEVELOPED

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:26.470
DEVELOPED BY THE PUBLIC AND

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:28.872
PRIVATE SECTOR.

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:30.107
IN MARCH SENSES BECAUSE MAYOR

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:31.508
MARK FARRELL CONVENED A ROUND

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.477
TABLE TO SPECIFICALLY DISCUSS AB

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:34.845
IS A PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.113
PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:37.314
MANUFACTURERS SUCH AS CREWS WHO

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:38.749
WERE LEFT

SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT NCHC.

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:49.026
THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:50.661
ENSURE THAT CITIES CONCERNS WERE

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:52.062
HEARD BY COMPANIES BEFORE THEY

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:53.797

STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:02.172
DISCUSS THE COMPANY'S APPROACH

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:03.607
TO PUBLIC SAFETY TO FURTHER CUT

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:04.741
TO INITIATE THIS DIALOGUE

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:05.342
BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

00:49:05.409 --> 00:49:07.577

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:09.479
AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK WE

00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:10.580
DEVELOP SEVERAL SPECIFIC POLICY

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:12.015
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN IMPROVE

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:12.749
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LAW

JURISDICTIONS.

00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:21.325
CLEAR PROTOCOL FOR COMMUNICATION

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.076
JEAN BERNARD.

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:21.378
HOW DOES THE DMV USE THE

DISENGAGEMENT REPORTS?

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:26.783
SO THAT WE NEED TO DISENGAGE

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:29.352
REPORTS TO TO MONITOR HALL THEIR

00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.154
TECHNOLOGY IS PROGRESSING AND

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.489
ALSO WHEN A COMPANY DOES APPLY

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:34.057
FOR A PERMIT WE USE THAT AS AN

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:36.660
ADDITIONAL TOOL TO EVALUATE. A

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:37.994
HOW THE PROGRESS THE COMPANIES

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:39.296

THANK YOU FOR THAT.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:47.504
SO WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.172
PROHIBITING MANUFACTURERS FROM

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.006
CHARGING PASSENGERS ONE THE

00:51:50.073 --> 00:51:52.108
TESTING PHASE.

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:53.376
WELL FOR THAT THAT THAT WAS

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:55.212
PRESS TO SEGMENT AT TESTING FROM

00:51:55.278 --> 00:51:56.646
DEPLOYMENT.

00:51:56.713 --> 00:51:58.548
IF THE COMPANY IS CHART ALLOWED

00:51:58.615 --> 00:52:00.050
TO CHARGE A FEE DURING TESTING A

00:52:00.116 --> 00:52:01.651
COMEY COULD CONTINUE

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:03.487
CONTINUOUSLY TASSELS THERE OUT

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:04.821
EVERITT THE PLANES WE WANT TO

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:06.756
MAKE SURE THAT COMPANIES. TESTED

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:11.294
AND THEN MOVED ON TO DEPLOYMENT.

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:14.431
IS TO KANSEN CHU.

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:15.632
PITCHER I JUST THOUGHT OH HOW

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:19.269
THE QUESTION FOUR. AND JD.

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:21.238
AND DR THE SENIOR ANALYST SO

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:23.707
YOU'RE. NOT WHEN WE HOW CLOSE

00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:25.575
ARE AUTONOMOUS VERY COOL ON THE

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:26.776
ROAD.

00:52:26.843 --> 00:52:30.113
BIKE LARGE. QUANTITY DO YOU SEE

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.783
THAT IT WILL INCREASE OR

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.018
DECREASE THE LOCAL TRAFFIC.

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:35.919
I WOULD IMAGINE THE

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:37.821
INTRODUCTION OF ANY NEW VEHICLES

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:38.722
ON THE STREETS WOULD INCREASE

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:40.357
TRAFFIC.

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:41.124
AND CONGESTION.

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:42.526
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:44.294
OPPORTUNITY FOR CITIES YOU KNOW

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:46.062
AND. IF WE DO HAVE MORE DATA

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:46.630
ABOUT.

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:48.398
THE MOVEMENT OF THESE VEHICLES

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:50.567
ON THE STREET TO. I'M DESIGN

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:52.202
ACCORDINGLY BUT I THINK AT THE

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:52.769
BEGINNING.

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.905
WE WOULD EXPECT FULL TRAFFIC

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:56.840
WHO MARK AND CHRIS WILSON POINT

00:52:56.907 --> 00:53:00.477
WE KIND OF. MORAL FIFTH THOMAS

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:01.811
SMITH VEHICLE ON THE ROAD.

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:03.647
IF NOTHING ELSE CHANGES THEN I'D

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:05.448
SAY YES MAHOOD THANK YOU.

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:06.716
THANK YOU THE BACK TO RUN THE

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:08.184
DMV.

00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:10.120
SO WHEN DOES THE DMV ANTICIPATE

00:53:10.186 --> 00:53:11.121
THEY WILL THEY WILL BEGIN

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:12.822
ISSUING REGULATIONS FOR TESTING

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:13.590
AND DEPLOYMENT VEHICLES OVER TEN

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.759
THOUSAND POUNDS.

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.527
SO AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NOT BEEN

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:18.962
FIFTH BEGUN WORKING ON THIS WE

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.064
WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THE SAFETY

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:22.699
AND REGULATORY CONDITIONS ABOUT

00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:24.501
SORT OF WITH THIS SO. AT THIS

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:27.404
TIME WE HAVE NOT BEGUN THAT.

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.372
LAST QUESTION TO THE DMV IS.

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:30.740
IS THE DMV CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:32.642
LACK OF APPLICATIONS TO TEST

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:34.578
DRIVE WAS CARS ON PUBLIC ROADS.

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:35.779
I KNOW THIS SHOWS THAT THE

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:36.913
COMPANIES ARE BEING VERY DELIVER

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.348
TIP IN.

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:39.349
LOOKING AT THAT AT TIMES

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:41.117
VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF

00:53:41.184 --> 00:53:42.419
SOME MEAN AN APPLICATION.

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:44.988
NO AT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT

00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:46.890
CONCERNED OKAY THANK YOU.

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:49.092
SO PROCEEDS BEING RICH.

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.527
IS A CSP GIVING ENOUGH

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:50.961
INFORMATION FOR THE

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:52.862
MANUFACTURERS IN THEIR LAW

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:55.098
ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION PLANTS.

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.232
BUT WE WE HAVE THE FIRST PLAN

00:53:56.299 --> 00:53:57.233
THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY REVIEWING

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:57.400
AND.

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:59.135
.

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.503
WHEN THE PROCESS OF THAT IT'S

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:01.738
NOT IT'S AN AND IT'S NOT ONLY

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:02.639
THE INFORMATION JUST HAVING A

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:03.974
DISCUSSION WITH THE ASSISTANT

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:04.541
CHIEF IS REVIEWING THE PLAN

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:05.675
ITSELF.

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:06.943
IT'S MAKING SURE THE INFORMATION

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.044
IS IN A.

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:09.813
USABLE READILY ACCESSIBLE

00:54:09.879 --> 00:54:10.947
FORMAT THAT'S KINDA HALF THE

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:12.415
BATTLE AND AND PULL IT ALL

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:13.650
TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE IT'S GONNA

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:15.085
BE EASY TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE

00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:16.353
OFFICER ON THE SIDE THE ROAD. IF

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:17.821
WE NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:18.755
WILL CERTAINLY ASK THE

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:20.123
MANUFACTURE FOR THAT INFORMATION

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.658
BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT I'M BEING

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:22.926
TOLD IS THAT WE HAVE THE

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:23.526

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:23.927
THIS FOR.

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:27.597
PERFECT.

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.132
SO WHAT IF ANYTHING DOES THE CHP

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.600
DO IF THEY LEARN A COMPANY WILL

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:32.268
BE TESTING AN AUTOMATED VEHICLE

00:54:32.335 --> 00:54:34.004
IN AN AREA WITHIN THEIR

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:37.340
JURISDICTION.

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:38.642
WELL THE FIRST THING WE WOULD DO

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:39.709
IT IS IS MAKE SURE THAT THEY

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.111
MANUFACTURE HAS PROVIDED THE

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:42.312
APPROPRIATE INFORMATION THAT

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:43.480
REQUIRED THE REGULATIONS BOTH

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:45.348
THE INFORMATION THAT GOES ALL

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:46.483
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:48.118
GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THAT THERE WHO

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:50.387
WHERE WEB WHEN WHAT WHY.

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.288
AND THEN ALSO OF COURSE MAKING

00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:53.256
SURE ALL THE INFORMATION FOR THE

00:54:53.323 --> 00:54:54.391
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:56.259
INTERACTION PLAN IS THERE. AND

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:57.160
THEN WE WOULD WITH SOME THAT

00:54:57.227 --> 00:54:58.595
WE'VE ALREADY DONE ACTUALLY JT

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:00.163

MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE

00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:09.339
LIST TO MAKE SURE WE ALL HAVE

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:11.007
THE SAME ENFORCEMENT POSTURE AND

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:12.509
CERTAINLY STAY IN TOUCH WITH

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:13.643
EACH OTHER AND SHARE EXPERIENCES

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.111
A BILL DRAWN THOSE EXPERIENCES

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.579
SO WE. ARE DOING THINGS THE

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:17.981
RIGHT WAY AND AND RELYING ON

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:20.016
EACH OTHER.

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:20.917
SO HERE'S ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:22.519
OF INTEREST.

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:23.953
HOW WITH THE CHP RESPONDED

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.955
SAYING AUTOMATED VEHICLE IN THE

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:26.990
AREA WHERE THEY HAVE NOT

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:27.457
SPECIFIED?

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:28.758
BUT THEY'VE.

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:31.428
WOULD BE TESTING.

00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:32.195
THAT YOU KNOW ACTION THERE'S

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:33.596
ACTUALLY AT ONE OF THE SECTIONS

00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:33.930
I REFERENCED.

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:35.765
.

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:36.533
COULD POTENTIALLY ADDRESS THAT

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:37.567
VERY THING I MEAN IT'S AN

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:39.936
INFRACTION TO BE TESTING AVR

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:40.670
PUBLIC ROADWAYS WITHOUT AN

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:42.405
APPROVED APPLICATION.

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:43.573
IF FOR INSTANCE THERE'S A

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.742
SITUATION WHERE A APPROVED A

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:47.510
LICENSEE OR SOMEONE HAS APPROVED

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:48.411
PERMIT AND THEY'RE JUST

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:49.479
OPERATING MAYBE A LITTLE BIT

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:50.547
OUTSIDE THE GEOGRAPHICAL

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:51.781
BOUNDARY WHERE THEY. WERE THAT

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.416
THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED WE WOULD

00:55:53.483 --> 00:55:55.151
CERTAINLY REFER THAT INFORMATION

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:56.119
TO THE DMV TO TAKE THE

00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:57.654
APPROPRIATE REGULATORY ACTION

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:57.987
AGAINST THAT.

00:55:58.054 --> 00:56:00.390
MANUFACTURE.

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:02.559
SO ONE WAS QUESTION FOR THE CHP.

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:05.395
SO YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OF.

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.230
I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS DONDE

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:09.733
TO IMPROVE THE.

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:12.435
ROLL OUT DOES HE'S PRE NEED ANY

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:13.002
ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION TO

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:14.003
REMOVE.

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.605
AUTOMATED VEHICLES THAT THERE

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:16.473
HAVE NOT BEEN PERMITTED TO

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:18.742
TESTING CALIFORNIA.

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.110
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:21.244
OF EVALUATING WHERE IN THE

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:22.045
VEHICLE CODE.

00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:24.314
ADJUSTMENTS MAY NEED TO BE MADE

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.915
TOO TO MAKE IT EXPLICIT THAT

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:27.584
BOTH THE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:28.418
AND OTHER.

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:30.653
AUTHORIZATIONS APPLY IN THE

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.221
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE CONTEXT.

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:33.923
.

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:35.592
FOR RIGHT NOW WE IT IN IN SOME

00:56:35.658 --> 00:56:37.260
PLACES IS PUTTING A SQUARE PEG

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:37.861
IN A ROUND HOLE.

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:40.096
BUT WE DO WE THINK WE DO HAVE

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:42.365
AN APPROACH TO TAKE TO GET AN

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:45.001
UNSAFE AB OFF THE ROAD SIR.

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:45.635

DC.

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:54.511
I WOULD SAY THAT.

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:55.912
AT LEAST YOUR.

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:58.148
TWO SENATORS ARE DOING A

00:56:58.214 --> 00:57:01.417
FANTASTIC JOB OF. ENSURING THAT

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.219
IF THE SENATE DOES MOVE FORWARD.

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:04.921
WITH THE BILL THAT.

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.322
THE CONCERNS THAT I'VE HEARD.

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:08.224
EXPRESSED HERE TODAY ARE TAKING

00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:08.925
INTO ACCOUNT.

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:10.627
WITH A WITH ANY FEDERAL BILL

00:57:10.693 --> 00:57:11.961

00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:18.168
SWIMMER BEEN A WHAT IS IT AND A

00:57:18.234 --> 00:57:19.736

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.608
.

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:27.143
I I THINK THAT QUESTION BOILS

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:27.443
DOWN TO.

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:31.114
REALLY.

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:32.882
AS STATES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:34.384
CURRENTLY ON.

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.186
ISSUE.

HUMAN TO OPERATE A MOTOR VEHICLE

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:42.759
HOW DOES THAT AUTHORITY EXTEND

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:43.326
TO WHEN THAT.

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:47.096
OPERATOR IS A A SOFTWARE ARM

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:49.165

STATES RETAIN THAT AUTHORITY

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:55.738
GOING FORWARD.

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:57.740
AS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE

INTRODUCED.

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:02.979

YEAH THIS POINT WE HAVEN'T BEEN

EXAMPLE WHERE CHRIS WAS TICKETED

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:22.332
THAT WAS JUST OUR OFFICERS OUT

00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:23.433
DOING WHAT THEY USUALLY DO

00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:25.101
MAKING SURE THAT ANY VEHICLE ON

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:26.769
THE ROAD IS FOLLOWING.

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:27.403

WE HAVE NOT YET DISCUSSED UP

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.584
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:42.085
SHOULD THAT WE SHOULD.

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:43.720

I'M A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION

00:58:57.934 --> 00:58:59.335

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:07.410
FRAMEWORK THAT WE HAVE NOW THAT

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:09.245

NOTICE WHEN IT'S ALREADY

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:23.092
HAPPENING.

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:24.560
A LOT OF THIS IS HAPPENING AT

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:26.162
THE STATE LEVEL YOU KNOW LIKE

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.900
THERE ARE IN CERTAIN STATES.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:11.968
WHERE WE HAVE?

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.803

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.531
JUST SO TWO QUICK FOLLOW UP TO

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.199
US IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICE ARE

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:44.767

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:51.607
DECISIONS.

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:52.875
SO I THINK ARE THE BIGGEST

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:55.344
QUESTION THAT WAS ANSWERED.

01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:56.846

SOME STATES ARE THAT WERE

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.993
ALLOWING TESTING TO GO FORWARD

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.061
WITHOUT AND SOME STATES.

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:14.330
THAT WERE NOT ALLOWING IT TO GO

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.032
FORWARD AND WE'VE SEEN A

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:18.000
MOVEMENT TOWARDS MANY STATES

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.502
INCLUDING NOW CALIFORNIA ARE

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.304
MOVING TOWARDS ALLOWING TESTING.

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:23.072
WITH THE APPROPRIATE

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:24.173

VEHICLE THAT IS ABLE TO BRING

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:40.423
THAT VEHICLE I TO A STOP.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:43.059
OR REMOVE IT FROM THE ROADWAY I

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.594

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.182
BECAUSE.

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:07.617
I THINK THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:08.518
THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:10.153

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:39.762
CONSEQUENCES I I DON'T THINK

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:42.932
WE'VE SEEN ON IN VEHICLES BEFORE.

OUR JOBS AND IDENTIFYING PRICING

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:41.424
IN MITIGATING RISK.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.626
THIS INCLUDES KNOWING WHEN

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:46.328
SYSTEMS DISENGAGE WARN DRIVERS

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.964
HAVE LAPSES IDENTIFY LAPSES

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.666
I'M OR FAIL A TO IDENTIFY

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.468
HAZARDS.

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:54.069
INSURERS WILL CERTAINLY GET

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:55.604
THIS DATA.

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:57.673
AS CLAIMS ARISE BUT IF WE'RE

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.208
GOOD TO GET OUT FRONT OF THIS WE

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:00.576
NEED AND AND BE ABLE OFFER

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:02.545
PRODUCTS. THAT A PROPERLY PRICED

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:04.313
PRODUCTS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.815
GET THIS DATA ON THE FRONT END.

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:08.884
IT HELPS US TO BOND CREE

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:10.653
CAPITAL FORMATION ON AND TO

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.855
CREATE AGAIN POLICY PRODUCTS FOR.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.057
INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:16.792
ONCE THERE'S A ROLL OUT. ON THE

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.595
DEPLOYMENT OF AB TECHNOLOGY AND

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:19.962
FINALLY I THINK.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:20.996
.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.631
THE INSURANCE MARKETPLACE CAN

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.533
SPEAK UNTO THE SAFETY OF

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.634
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES BY

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.002
AVOIDING CROSS SUBSIDIES THAT

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:29.538
HARM BETTER SAFER TECHNOLOGIES.

01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:31.340
WHILE BENEFITING READER WEAKER

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:33.809
AND LESS SAFE TECHNOLOGIES.

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.277
I THINK IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:36.946
ALREADY BUT THE DISENGAGEMENT

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:38.481
REPORTS WE THINK ARE.

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:41.016
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS.

01:08:41.083 --> 01:08:44.019
DATA ACQUISITION AND THESE

01:08:44.086 --> 01:08:45.788
REPORTS HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.490
THE RISK OF SYSTEM SHUT DOWNS OR

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:48.624
HANDOFFS.

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:50.493
AND I THINK IN PARTICULAR ON

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:52.528
THE USABILITY OF THESE REPORTS

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.096
ON THAT THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.831
ON THERE REALLY INSTRUCTS NOT

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:57.266
ONLY THAT IT JUST ENGAGED BUT

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:58.400
WHY DISENGAGED.

01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:01.136
AND ALLOWS UNINSURED UNDERSTAND

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.805
WHICH TECHNOLOGIES ON WORK

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.373
BETTER AND ARE SAFER.

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.308
AND THEN FINALLY I KNOW THERE'S

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.309
BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:07.877
THIS.

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:10.112

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:16.218
DO BELIEVE.

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:16.986
THAT.

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:18.220

THAT THE HUMAN DRIVER A MAY HAVE

INTERPOSING EFFORTS THAT ARE

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:04.994

FEDERAL LEVEL ON A WHOLE HOST OF

AV START ACT THAT IS IN DC WERE

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.089
VERY GRATEFUL FOR SENATOR

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:36.392
FEINSTEIN AND SENATOR HARRIS IS

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:39.061
ROLE. IN TAPPING THE BRAKES ON

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.963
THAT LEGISLATION IT'S

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.331
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED FOR A

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:44.199
NUMBER OF REASONS ONE OF THEM

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:46.702
BEING THAT WOULD PREEMPT STATE

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:47.469
LAW.

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:48.170
AND IT WOULD CREATE A REGULATORY

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:51.040
VACUUM WHERE THERE ARE NO NEW

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:52.508
FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.680
SPECIFIC TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY.

01:11:57.746 --> 01:12:00.182
WHILE OPENING THE FLOODGATES FOR

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:02.017
THE VEHICLES NOT ONLY TO BE.

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:04.053
DEVELOPED AND TESTED BUT

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:07.022
ACTUALLY TO BE SOLD CONSUMERS.

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:08.657
AND I THINK THAT BOOK THE.

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:10.292
CRASHES THAT ARE OCCURRING RIGHT

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:12.861
NOW OR UNFORTUNATELY VERY TRAGIC

01:12:12.928 --> 01:12:15.097
EVIDENCE THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:18.634
CAREFUL. ARM AND NOT.

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:19.935
LEAPT INTO THIS SPACE

PREMATURELY.

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.472
AND I WOULD QUOTE FROM OF

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:25.374
TESTIMONY BY THE PRESIDENT OF

LEADING AUTO INSURANCE COMPANIES.

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:38.320
THAT THE PROCESS CREATED IN THE

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:41.023
AB START ACT WOULD ALLOW

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:42.858
UNTESTED AND UNPROVEN.

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:44.493
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO BE SOLD

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.594
TO THE PUBLIC WITHOUT

NECESSARY PROTECTIONS. BOTH TO

SHARING THE ROADS WITH THEM.

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:57.906
.

01:12:57.973 --> 01:12:59.708
THE AV START ACT TAKES A WRONG

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:02.144
TURN BY ALLOWING FOR THE SALE OF

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.112
POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF

UNDERSTANDS OUR CAPABILITIES AND

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:14.523

PROTECT AGAINST HACKERS.

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:21.063
ACCORDING TO PATRICK LYNN WHO IS

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.598
DIRECTOR OF THE ETHICS IN

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:23.699
EMERGING SCIENCE IS GROUP A

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.400
CALIFORNIA POLYTECHNIC

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:27.903
UNIVERSITY SELF DRIVING CARS MAY

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.471
ENABLE NEW CRIMES WE CAN'T EVEN

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:30.739
IMAGINE.

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:33.008
TODAY SO WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.710
IT'S PREMATURE TO ALLOW THE

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.311
VEHICLES TO BE SOLD TO THE

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:39.114
PUBLIC BEFORE THESE PROTECTIONS

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.316
ARE IN PLACE. THEY REALLY SHOULD

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.552
HAPPEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:44.386
THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:45.888
SAFETY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:47.422
PROMULGATE THE RULES

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:50.159
SO THAT THESE VEHICLES ARE

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:51.927
RESISTANT TO HACKING.

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:54.563
AND WE ALSO ADVOCATE THAT THE

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:55.764
VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE TO PASS A

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:58.000
DRIVER'S TEST.

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.168
IF YOU ARE I ARE GETTING A

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:00.869
DRIVER'S LICENSE WE NEED TO

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:02.671
DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN OPERATE

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:03.906
SAFELY ON THE ROAD VARIOUS

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:05.707
CONDITIONS.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:06.809
THESE VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE TO DO

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.644
THE SAME.

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:10.078
RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THE VEHICLES

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:11.814
THAT ARE OUT THERE CAN'T REALLY

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.650
SEE TO GO SAFELY IN CONDITIONS

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:17.786
SUCH AS YOU KNOW OR FOG OR HEAVY

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:19.454
RAINS OR DENSE SMOKE.

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:21.657
WORK IF THEY GO OVER A STEEP

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:24.359
HILL WHAT THEY SEE IS SCOTT.

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:24.993
SO.

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.963
THEIR REAL LIMITATIONS TO WHERE

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.032
THEY CAN BE DRIVEN SAFELY. AND

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:31.867
THE PUBLIC IS VERY CONFUSED IN

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.368
FACT THEIR NEWS REPORTS AND SAY

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:34.870
THAT ELAINE CHAO WHO IS A

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:37.573
SECRETARY TRANSPORTATION IS SAID

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.141
SHE HERSELF IS VERY CONFUSED.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:40.242
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.477
DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY THERE ARE

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.246
SEMI AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THAT

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.281
ARE BEING SOLD TO THE PUBLIC

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:48.584
WHERE THEIR. UNCERTAIN WHAT THEY

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.819
CAN EXPECT THE VEHICLE TO DO TO

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:52.788
KEEP THEM SAFE AND WHAT ROLE

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:54.122
THEY NEED TO APPLY. THERE'S A

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:57.526
LOT OF DATA AVAILABLE THAT SHOWS

01:14:57.593 --> 01:14:59.461
THAT WHEN PEOPLE.

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:02.097
M. GOOGLE COULD I BELIEVE CAN

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:02.998
CONFIRM THIS GOOGLE IN WAY MO

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.833
THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN SEMI

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.668
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THEY TEND TO

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:07.836
BE LULLED INTO A FALSE SENSE OF

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:11.273
SECURITY. AND THROWN ZONE OUT.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.676
AND WE'RE QUESTIONING THE WISDOM

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:17.713
OF ALLOWING THOSE VEHICLES TO BE

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:19.147
SOLD TO THE PUBLIC.

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:21.583
BECAUSE OF THE.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:22.684
THEY THE FACT THAT.

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.887
.

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:26.388
THE VEHICLES.

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.423
CAN'T BE RELIED ON TO OPERATE

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:31.493
SAFELY. AT ALL TIMES AND IT'S

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.528
CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE THEY KNOW

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:34.863
WHEN THEY NEED TO TAKE THE WHEEL.

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.598
AND IT'S ALSO UNREALISTIC TO

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:38.333
EXPECT SOMEONE WHO HASN'T BEEN

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.802
PAYING ATTENTION. TO BE ABLE TO

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:42.671
PAY ATTENTION AND SAFELY

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:44.373
NAVIGATE IN AN EMERGENCY

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:46.308
SITUATION FOR INSTANCE IF THE

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.610
VEHICLE THIS ENGAGES WHEN IT

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.646
APPROACH IS A CONSTRUCTION ZONE.

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:51.580
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.482
DISENGAGEMENT REPORTS AND WE

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:56.018
APPLAUD THE DMV FOR REQUIRING

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:57.452
THOSE AND ALSO REQUIRING

01:15:57.519 --> 01:15:59.388
INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN THE

01:15:59.454 --> 01:16:01.023
VEHICLES DISENGAGED. A LOT OF

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:03.592
TIMES WHEN THEY DISENGAGE IT IS.

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:05.360
IN CONSTRUCTION ZONES.

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:06.194
WHEN.

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:08.931
YOU KNOW OUR OUR STATE WORKERS

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:10.465
OR OTHER WORKERS MAY BE. IN

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:12.167
HARM'S WAY.

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:14.536
AND I WOULD.

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:16.338
JUST VERY BRIEFLY LIKE TO

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:16.672
MENTION THAT.

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.807
.

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:20.409
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HEARD.

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:22.044
FROM TESLA THAT.

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:24.279
.

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:25.781
PUTTING AUTOPILOT IN THEIR

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:28.917
VEHICLES REDUCE CRASHES WHERE

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:30.352
THEY ARE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED BY

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.254
FORTY.

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:34.156
SENT AND THAT HAS BEEN QUESTION

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:36.425
FOR A LONG TIME NOW THERE'S NEW

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:38.360
REASON TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.195
THAT FIGURE AS ENCOURAGING IS IT

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:40.796
IS.

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:42.764
.

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:44.299
WHEN ADVOCATES FOR HIGHWAY AND

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:47.202
AUTO SAFETY EXAMINED THE FIGURE

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.904
WHAT THEY REPORTED IN THEIR

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:49.871
LETTER TO THE CHAIR OF THE

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.073
NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.508
BOARD WHICH IS A SISTER AGENCY

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:54.676
WITH THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.478
TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION.

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:58.513
UNDER THE US DEPARTMENT OF

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.215
TRANSPORTATION.

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:01.516
THEY REPORTED THAT THE NHTSA

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:02.617
REPORT MAKES A STATEMENT THEY

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:04.086
CRASH

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:06.788
RATES FOR TESLA VEHICLES DROPPED

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:07.689
AFTER THE INSTALLATION OF AUTO

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:08.991
PILOT.

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:10.826
THIS IS AN UNPROVEN AND

01:17:10.892 --> 01:17:12.661
UNSUPPORTED CONCLUSION BECAUSE

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.062
IN THE SAME SECTION OF THE

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.931
REPORT THE AGENCY ADMITS THAT

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:17.966
THE SAFETY IMPROVEMENT. IS NOT

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:21.203
RELATED TO ACTUAL AUTOPILOT USE.

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:22.771
THE FACT IS THAT THIS COMPARISON

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:24.406
IN NO WAY PROVES THAT AUTOPILOT

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.842
REDUCES CRASHES.

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:28.977

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:52.167
DOCTOR KALRA STATED THAT THE

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.970
NHTSA FOUND THE TESLA VEHICLES

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:56.238
EQUIPPED WITH AUTO PILOT WERE

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:58.340
INVOLVED IN FORTY PERCENT FEER

CRASH RATES. WHICH

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:06.875
WOULD HAVE INDICATED THAT

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:08.643
FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:10.846
NECESSARY. AND ACTUALLY IF YOU

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:12.214
LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.616
TESLA HAD INCLUDED.

AUTOPILOT SO. THERE ARE THOSE

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:26.228

VEHICLES SO I HAVE A FEW

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:23.218
THOUGHTS TO OFFER.

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:25.387
FIRST MODERN CARS ARE ALREADY

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.856
EXTREMELY HIGHLY COMPUTERIZED.

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:29.524
EVEN THOSE CARS THAT DON'T

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:30.458
INCORPORATE ANY KIND OF

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:31.226
AUTONOMOUS OR SELF DRIVING

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:32.928
CAPABILITY.

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.496
THE TREND HAS BEEN TOWARD DRIVE

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:36.231
BY WIRE SYSTEMS.

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:38.700
LIKE FLY BY WIRE IN AIRPLANES

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:40.502
WE'RE TURNING THE WHEEL OR

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:41.236
STEPPING ON THE GAS OR BRICK

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:43.371
PEDALS. MAY NO LONGER PHYSICALLY

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:43.939
ACTIVATE THE CARS MECHANICAL

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:45.907
CYST.

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:47.642
THE COMPUTER IS TOLD THAT THE

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:48.243
DRIVER PERFORMED A PARTICULAR

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:49.177
ACTION.

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:50.745
AND THE COMPUTER DECIDES

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.380
AGAIN IN SELF DRIVING OR NON

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.916
SELF DRIVING VEHICLES.

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:55.517
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.619
ACTION SHOULD?

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:58.887
THIS MEANS THAT IN SOME CARS

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:00.155
COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR EXAMPLE

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:01.690
DECIDES ON THE CONNECTION

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.625
OR LACK OF CONNECTION.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:04.559
BETWEEN STEPPING ON THE BRAKE

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:05.460
PEDAL AND MECHANICALLY ENGAGING

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.696
THE BREAK.

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:09.130
THAT MAKES THE RELIABILITY OF

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:10.432
THAT SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:12.100
CARS SAFE OPERATION.

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:13.101
BECAUSE MALICIOUS OR DEFECTIVE

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:15.103
SOFTWARE.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:16.438
DEPLOYED TO A CAR COULD MAKE IT

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:17.505
MALFUNCTIONING TRAFFIC DISABLE

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:19.341
SENSORS.

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:21.076
OR EVEN INVERT SAFETY LOGIC

01:21:21.142 --> 01:21:22.477
SO THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:23.411
ATTEMPTS TO CLOSE CRASHES

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:25.981
INSTEAD OF AVOIDING THEM.

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:27.148
THE MOST DISTURBING SCENARIO

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:28.950
THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:29.818
IN RELATION TO DELIBERATE

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:31.653
ATTACKS ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.155
HAS TO DO WITH SKILL.

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:35.156
HA AND I THINK MISTER MERCS

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:36.658
ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER AN

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:37.892
ATTACKER WHO WANTS TO CAUSE

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:39.594
MAYHEM AND FEAR TO TRY TO CAUSE

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:41.196
A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:42.530
TO MALFUNCTION IN THE SAME WAY

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:44.099
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:45.000
SUCH AS INTENTIONALLY CRASHING

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:47.269
INTO PEDESTRIANS.

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:47.869
OF COURSE THERE'S NO REASON TO

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.537
ASSUME.

01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:51.006
LET THIS KIND OF ATTACK IS

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:52.007
STRAIGHTFORWARD OR EASY TO PULL

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:53.475
OFF.

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:54.676
IT WOULD REQUIRE SUBVERTING THE

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:55.977
WIDE RANGE OF SECURITY CONTROLS

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:58.079
WITHOUT BEING DETECTED.

01:21:58.146 --> 01:21:59.114
BUT IF IT COULD BE DONE FOR

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.448
VARIOUS REASONS THE CONSEQUENCES

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:01.950
COULD BE. MORE WIDESPREAD AND

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:03.652
MORE FRIGHTENING.

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:04.619
THEN OTHER KINDS OF

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:06.121
TECHNOLOGICAL SABOTAGE DIRECTED

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:08.189
AND ON A TON OF THE.

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.057
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:10.859
DEMONSTRATIONS ALREADY THAT

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:12.327
SOFTWARE BASED ATTACKS AGAINST

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.562
CAR SAFETY COULD BE PRACTICAL.

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:15.864
THE MOST FAMOUS IS PROBABLY A

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:17.866
TWENTY FIFTEEN DEMONSTRATION.

01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:19.401
BY TWO RESEARCHERS WHO SHOWED

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:19.934
THAT THEY COULD REMOTELY

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:21.870
TAKEOVER SOME OF THE COMPUTER

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:23.438
SYSTEMS IN A JEEP CHEROKEE.

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:24.639
WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS BEING

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:25.640
DRIVEN IN A WAY THAT COULD HAVE

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.542
CAUSED THE CRASH.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:28.610
IT'S WORTH REITERATING THAT THE

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.078
VEHICLE IN THAT CASE WAS NOT

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:31.313
USING ANY SORT OF DRIVERLESS OR

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:33.048
AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY.

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:34.182
A HUMAN WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.184
OPERATING THE VEHICLE.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.053
EVEN SO IT GOES TO SHOW THE

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.587
COMPUTERS ARE ALREADY SO

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:42.157
INTEGRAL TO THE CAR'S OPERATION.

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:43.525
DOT THE PRESENCE OF RELIABLE

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:44.559
SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:46.928
A SAFETY HAZARD.

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.863
AS A RESULT JUST AS WITH OTHER

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.365
KINDS OF COMPUTING DEVICES BUT

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:52.600
MAYBE WITH HIGHER STAKES.

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:54.936
SOFTWARE UPDATES AND FIXES NEED

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.705
TO BE PERFORMED REGULARLY AND

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:57.872
THE INTEGRITY OF THE SOFTWARE

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:59.841
UPDATES NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED.

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:01.476
UNFORTUNATELY

01:23:01.543 --> 01:23:02.577
THE PROSPECT OF MAKING THE

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:03.812
SOFTWARE IN THE VEHICLES NON

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:05.480
UPDATABLE. IN ORDER TO AVOID

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:07.382
MALICIOUS UPDATES.

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:09.017
WOULD BE IN EVEN WORSE SOLUTION

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:09.951
BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN THAT

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:11.086
EFFECTS COULD BE FIXED.

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:13.521
WHEN THEY'RE DISCOVERED.

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:15.023
ARE AGAIN THIS RISK IS NOT

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:15.990
ENTIRELY SPECIFIC TO SELF

01:23:16.057 --> 01:23:17.459
DRIVING CARS

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:18.526
INCREASINGLY MANY OF THE SAME

01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:19.861
KINDS OF RISKS ALREADY EXISTING

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.730
CURRENT MODELS.

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:22.797
WHERE SAFETY FUNCTIONS ARE

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:23.998
MANAGED BY SOFTWARE THAT NEEDS

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:25.300
TO BE UPDATED OVER TIME AND IS

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:29.704
BEING UPDATED OVER TIME?

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.740
MANY OF HIS INCREASES IN RISKS

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:33.808
OUR ESSENTIALLY INCREMENTAL

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:34.376
INCREASES IN RISKS THAT MAY

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:35.777
ALREADY EXIST.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.112
SELF DRIVING VEHICLES MAY

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:39.447
CONTAIN ADDITIONAL SENSORS AND

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:41.015
ADDITIONAL LOGICAL FUNCTIONALITY.

01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:42.784
LEADING TO ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.319
WHICH DOES PROVIDE MORE

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:46.321
OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVENUES FOR

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:47.655
EXPORTABLE VULNERABILITIES

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:49.023
RELATIVE TO HIGHLY COMPUTERIZED

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:49.491
VEHICLES THAT ARE LESS

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:51.226
AUTONOMOUS.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.894
ALSO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES MAYBE

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:54.396
MORE RELIANT ON ACCURATE MAP

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:56.364
DATA. AND OTHER KINDS OF LIVE

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:57.999
DATA SERVICES PROVIDED BY

01:23:58.066 --> 01:23:58.733
MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.468
SUPPLIERS. AND THAT COULD BE

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:02.704
ANOTHER SOURCE OF DISRUPTION.

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:03.738
IF THESE SERVICES ARE INTERFERED

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:06.341
WITH OR DISABLED IN SOME WAY.

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.909
WE CAN ENVISION SOME KINDS OF

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:09.110
RISKS THAT ARE MORE SPECIFIC TO

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:10.912
SELF DRIVING CARS.

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:12.647
SUCH AS SO CALLED ADVERSARIAL

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.449
EXAMPLES IN COMPUTER VISION.

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:15.483
WHICH ARE IMAGES THAT ARE

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:16.951
SPECIFICALLY CRAFTED TO BE

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:18.887
SYSTEMATICALLY MISINTERPRETED.

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:19.721
BY PARTICULAR KIND OF COMPUTER

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:21.689
VISION SYSTEM.

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:23.191
IN GENERAL WE MIGHT THINK OF

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:24.692
COMPUTER SOFTWARE AS MORE

01:24:24.759 --> 01:24:25.794
COLORFUL AND READILY MANIPULATED.

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:27.695
THAN HUMAN BEINGS.

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:29.164
BUT OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE ALSO

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.232
EXTREMELY IN PERFECT AND PRONE

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:33.201
TO BIAS ERROR IN THIS BEHAVIOR.

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:34.269
AND VULNERABLE TO THINGS LIKE

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:35.970
OPTICAL ILLUSIONS.

01:24:36.037 --> 01:24:37.972
AND JUST BECOMING DISORIENTED.

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:39.741
IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY THAT HUMANS

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.276
AND MACHINES CAN BE MANIPULATED

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:42.944
OR LEAD TO MISBEHAVE IN

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:45.079
DIFFERENT WAYS FROM ONE ANOTHER.

01:24:45.146 --> 01:24:46.514
AS MANY OBSERVERS HAVE NOTED

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:47.916
COMPUTERS DON'T HAVE TO BE

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:50.118
AFFECTED BY FATIGUE OR EMOTION.

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:51.786
OR INTOXICANTS THEY DON'T DRIVE

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:53.221
DRUNK THEY DON'T GET ANGRY THEY

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:54.923
DON'T FALL ASLEEP.

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:57.358
THEY USUALLY CAN'T BE DISTRACTED.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.927
AND THEIR SENSORS MAY BE ABLE TO

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:00.495
FUNCTION IN CONDITIONS WHERE

01:25:00.562 --> 01:25:01.362
HUMAN SENSES WOULD BE STARTED.

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:05.166
AND VICE VERSA.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:07.001
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE MANUFACTURES

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:08.369
EXPERTS AND OTHER RESEARCHERS

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:08.870
NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.104
MANUFACTURERS

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:11.973
ARE ALSO PRODUCTIVELY EXPLORING

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.374
THE TOPIC OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:14.976
CYBERSECURITY.

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:16.444
FOR EXAMPLE ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:17.812
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:19.380
AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:21.416
HAVE FOUND IMPORTANT PROBLEMS

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:22.016
AND RISKS AS HAVE INDEPENDENT

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.952
GROUPS. THIS RESEARCH HELPS US

01:25:24.018 --> 01:25:25.420
TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT WHAT'S

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:26.020
POSSIBLE AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE

01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:27.322
FIXED.

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:28.623
BUT SECURITY RESEARCHERS WHO

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:29.557
COME TO OUR ORGANIZATION FOR

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:31.025
LEGAL ADVICE.

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:32.594
OFTEN WORRY THAT THEIR WORK MAY

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:33.628
EXPOSE THEM TO LIABILITY OR

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:35.029
LITIGATION.

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:36.531
FOR INSTANCE FROM MANUFACTURERS

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:37.665
WHO MIGHT FEAR EMBARRASSMENT

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:39.400
WHEN PROBLEMS ARE REVEALED.

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:41.035
SO PROTECTING RESEARCHERS AND

01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:41.669
MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN DO

01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:45.707
THEIR JOB IS OF TREMENDOUS

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:46.541
THERE MANY GOVERNMENT AND

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:48.176
INDUSTRY ENTITIES WORKING IN THE

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:50.211
FIELD OF VEHICULAR CYBERSECURITY.

01:25:50.278 --> 01:25:51.713
INCLUDING NHTSA AND IT IS AN

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:52.747
INDUSTRY GROUP CALLED THE AUTO

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:54.482
ISAC.

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:58.520
NEXT THE SAE AND OTHERS.

01:25:58.586 --> 01:25:59.854
IT'S REALLY WORTH EMPHASIZING

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:01.389
THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GUIDANCE

01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:02.957
AND STANDARDS IN THIS AREA IS

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:05.059
NOT A SILVER BULLET.

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:06.394
BECAUSE A SINGLE SOFTWARE BUGS

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:07.629
CAN BE ENOUGH TO CREATE A MAJOR

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:09.597
SAFETY AND SECURITY RISK.

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:10.965
MANY OF THE STANDARDS RELATED TO

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.133
VEHICULAR SECURITY ARE

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.034
ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT A

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:14.569
RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL.

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:16.838
AND NOT A LOW LEVEL OF TECHNICAL

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.306
DETAILS WERE SOME OF THE BUGS

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:19.140
MAY EXIST ON THE VULNERABILITIES

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:20.975
MAKE THIS.

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:22.410
INFORMATION SECURITY HAS BEEN AN

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:24.078
ENORMOUS CHALLENGE ELSEWHERE IN

01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:25.580
IT.

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.682
THERE HAS BEEN LOTS OF HACKS

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:29.150
LOTS OF OLDER GOODIES AND OTHER

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:30.885
KINDS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS.

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:32.120
THAT WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH VERY

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:33.955
WELL THAT THE COMPUTING

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:34.856
INDUSTRIES HAVE NOT DEALT WITH

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:36.624
VERY WELL. AND OVERALL THIS IS A

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:37.825
RELATIVELY NEW PREOCCUPATION FOR

01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:39.727
THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY.

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:41.496
SO THE INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURERS

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:42.597
BEYOND SIMPLY FOLLOWING A

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:44.232
CHECKLIST OR FORMULA. ARE GOING

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:46.301
TO NEED TO GET A LOT OF SPECIFIC

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:47.769
IN HOUSE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE.

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:50.738
IN INFORMATION SECURITY.

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.273
MODERN CARS ALSO HAVE EVER

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.708
GREATER PRIVACY RISKS BECAUSE OF

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:54.676
THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT AND

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:56.077
COMMUNICATE.

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:56.778
ABOUT THEIR OCCUPANTS

01:26:56.844 --> 01:26:58.913
WHEREABOUTS AND ENVIRONMENTS.

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.248
WELL IF THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.849
DESIGNS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT.

01:27:01.916 --> 01:27:03.184
INTENDED ENORMOUS NUMBER OF

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:04.752
SENSORS THAT CAN DETECT MORE

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:06.254
ABOUT THESE THINGS

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:07.722
AND ALL OF THEM TEND TO PHONE

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:08.790
HOME TO THEIR MANUFACTURES FOR A

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:10.792
RANGE OF REASONS.

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:11.926
INCLUDING HELPING THE

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:12.427
MANUFACTURE TO DEBUG THE

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:13.728
SOFTWARE.

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.029
AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW IT

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:16.164
PERFORMS IN PARTICULAR REAL

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:18.099
WORLD SITUATIONS.

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:18.833
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.301
MANUFACTURERS WOULD WANT THAT

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:20.868
INFORMATION FOR ALL OF THESE

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:22.503
REASONS.

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:23.171
BUT IT MEANS THAT THE

01:27:23.237 --> 01:27:24.539
MANUFACTURERS WILL COME INTO

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:26.741
POSSESSION OF A LOT OF SENSITIVE

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:29.177
INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE.

01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:30.612
WHERE PEOPLE GO WHOM THEY WERE

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:32.447
WITH WHAT HE DID?

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:33.615
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS

01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:34.515
ABOUT THEIR HANDLING AND

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.618
RETENTION OF THAT DATA.

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:37.986
THERE ALSO RISKS TO PRIVACY

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:40.088
POSSIBLE WHEN VEHICLES ANNOUNCER

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:42.457
BROADCAST THEIR OWN LOCATIONS.

01:27:42.523 --> 01:27:43.925
IF YOU EVER SEEN SERVICES LIKE

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:44.993
FLIGHTAWARE FOR TRACKING

01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:46.794
AIRPLANES.

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:48.096
THEY'RE USING THE AIRPLANE

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:49.931
EQUIVALENT CALLED THE DSP.

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:51.399
TO LITERALLY TRACK INDIVIDUAL

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:52.767
AIRPLANES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:54.469
FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT.

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:55.870
WE WOULDN'T BE THRILLED TO SEE A

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:57.805
CAR VERSION. OF THE FLIGHT AWARE

01:27:57.872 --> 01:27:59.340
SERVICE TO LET YOU LOOK UP THE

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:00.308
WHEREABOUTS OF SOMEONE'S

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:01.943
PARTICULAR CAR.

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:03.645
YEP TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THAT COULD

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.046
BE A PRIVACY INFRINGING

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:06.948
CONSEQUENCE OF SOME DESIGNS FOR

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:10.752
LIKE WIRELESS LOCATION BROADCAST.

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:11.886
FOR THAT REASON WE COMMENTED

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.488
LAST YEAR ON THE NHTSA VEHICLE

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:14.689
TO VEHICLE OR FEET OF THE

01:28:14.756 --> 01:28:16.090
PROPOSAL.

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:17.992
A PROPOSED REGULATORY MANDATE

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:18.459
FOR VEHICLE TO VEHICLE

01:28:18.526 --> 01:28:19.961
COMMUNICATIONS.

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:23.097
pFUTURE SAFETY APPLICATIONS FOR

01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:25.166
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES.

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.534
WE ARGUED THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:27.835
AN OBSOLETE AND PRIVACY INVASIVE

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:29.270
TECHNOLOGY. THAT COULD

01:28:29.337 --> 01:28:30.805
POTENTIALLY ALLOW ANYONE TO

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:31.939
MONITOR A VEHICLE BY RECEIVING

01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:33.675
ITS RADIO SIGNALS.

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.043
BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CARS WOULD

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.677
EFFECTIVELY BROADCAST THERE ON

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:37.378
THE PETITIONS.

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:38.980
THE COMPARATIVELY SMALL NUMBER

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.882
OF IDENTITIES PER CAR.

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.050
THIS REGULATION HASN'T BEEN

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:43.685
ADOPTED SO FAR BUT SEVERAL

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:45.053
AUTOMAKERS ARE VOLUNTARILY

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:46.654
IMPLEMENTING TELEMETRY AND

01:28:46.721 --> 01:28:47.055
VEHICLE TO VEHICLE

01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:48.322
COMMUNICATIONS.

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:49.290
AND WE REALLY NEED TO THINK

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:50.291
ABOUT THE PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:51.659
OF THOSE DATA FLOWS.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.494
FOR SAFETY REASONS

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:54.729
WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:56.497
CAR NEWS THAT A CLAIM TO

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:57.098
POSITION REPORT IS REALLY FROM

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:57.331
ANOTHER

01:28:57.398 --> 01:28:58.933
CAR.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.034
AND NOT FROM SOMEONE PRETENDING

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:00.835
TO BE A CAR AND SAYING HEY I'M

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:03.538
IN YOUR WAY.

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:04.739
IF MEMBERS ARE SAFER INTERESTED

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:05.840
IN THIS TOPIC THERE'S A HUGE

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:07.008
AMOUNT OF READING YOU CAN DO AND.

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:08.543
PEOPLE WITH INTEREST

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:10.845
THOUGHTS IN THIS AREA.

01:29:10.912 --> 01:29:11.446
INCLUDING SOME OF THE FEDERAL

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:13.848
REGULATORS THE GAO RESEARCHERS

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.917
OF WHO PUT OUT A REPORT TWO

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:16.384
YEARS AGO ON VEHICULAR

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:17.652
CYBERSECURITY.

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:19.320
AND THE SECURITY ENGINEERS AT

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:20.888
THE INDIVIDUAL AUTOMAKERS AND I

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:22.223
WOULD ENCOURAGE IN THE FUTURE.

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:23.558
GETTING SOME ENGINEERS IN HERE

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:24.292
AS WELL AS.

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:25.927
LAWYERS AND LOBBYISTS BECAUSE

01:29:25.993 --> 01:29:27.695
THE ENGINEERS WILL HAVE A LOT OF

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:28.830
INTERESTING HANDS ON EXPERIENCE.

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:30.898
.

01:29:30.965 --> 01:29:31.766
A BOARD MEMBER OF OUR OWN

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:33.501
ORGANIZATION BRAD TEMPLETON HAS

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:34.836
DONE A LOT OF CONSULTING IN THIS

01:29:34.902 --> 01:29:36.304
AREA AND HAS A VERY INTERESTING

01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:37.705
AND THOROUGH WEBSITE.

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.140
ON THE TOPIC AND OF COURSE

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:40.742
SECURITY RESEARCHERS OUTSIDE OF

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:41.709
INDUSTRY LIKE ACADEMIC

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:44.011
RESEARCHERS IN THE UNIVERSITIES

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:45.012
HAVE A LOT OF HANDS ON

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:47.181
EXPERIENCE ON THE SECURITY TOPIC.

01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:48.816
IF WE CAN BE OF ANY HELP IN

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:49.484
FINDING SPECIALISTS IN THIS AREA

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:51.252
YOU'D BE.

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:52.153
THRILLED TO AND.

QUESTIONS.

01:29:57.425 --> 01:29:58.793
THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.561
IT'S ABOUT A REAL PAPER.

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:01.462
I THOUGHT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

01:30:01.529 --> 01:30:02.930
MEMBERS SET THANK YOU FOR HAVING

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:04.532
ME HERE HIGH I KNOW ORGANIZED

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:06.200
LABOR DISCUSSION LIKE THIS IS

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:07.502
SORT OF LIKE HAVING YOUR CRAZY

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:08.903
HAND IN THE ROOM OR SOMETHING.

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:10.805
BECAUSE THE THOUGHT IS THAT ALL

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:13.941
WE CARE ABOUT IS OUR JOBS COM AT

01:30:14.008 --> 01:30:16.844
ANTIQUATED CONCEPT TOO MANY OF

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.312
THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM FRANKLY.

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:20.748
THEY DON'T CARE WHAT WE DO.

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:23.518
BUT WE ALSO KNOW SOMETHING ELSE.

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.853
OUR MEMBERS DRIVE THESE VEHICLES

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.555
EVERYDAY

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:29.791
DAY IN AND DAY OUT THEY KNOW

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:31.592
MORE ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF

01:30:31.659 --> 01:30:32.426
MOTOR VEHICLES THAN ANYBODY

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:34.462
THERE S..

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:35.997
THEY KNOW THINGS THAT THE

01:30:36.063 --> 01:30:37.865
MANUFACTURERS DATE DON'T KNOW

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:39.667
THEY KNOW A LOT.

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:41.402
AND THEY KNOW A LOT ABOUT SAFETY

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:43.805
IN THEIR VERY CONCERNED WITH

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:45.606
MAJOR ISSUES.

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:46.941
WITH THE TESTING AUTONOMOUS

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:48.509
VEHICLES WERE NOT HOSTILE TO

01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:50.011
CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY THEY

01:30:50.077 --> 01:30:51.179
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME THAT

01:30:51.245 --> 01:30:52.947
WOULDN'T BE A TEAMSTERS UNION IF

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:54.849
HORSES DIDN'T BECOME TRY.

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:57.218
SO THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE BUT

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:59.453
THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT SAFETY.

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.454
AND THERE IS A SENSE THAT WE

01:31:00.521 --> 01:31:02.123
HAVE.

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:04.058
THAT THE PACE OF CHANGE IS SO

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.861
BASS.

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:10.231
THAT POLICYMAKERS ARE JUST NOT.

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.867
ABLE TO RESPOND.

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:13.501
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:14.635
DO.

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:16.070
AND SO.

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:17.705
THEY'RE NOT

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:19.440
IN LEGISLATURE'S

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.008
AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:22.810
ARE SORT OF.

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:24.645
ABANDONING THE FIELD IN A

01:31:24.712 --> 01:31:25.246
CERTAIN WAY AND I'LL TELL YOU

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:27.448
WHY.

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:30.084
LET'S TALK ABOUT FIRST EMPLOYEE

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:33.688
AND SAFETY TESTING STANDARDS.

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:36.724
WHAT IS OUR SUCCESSFUL TEST OF

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:38.860
AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES?

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:40.595
WHAT IS THE STANDARD

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:43.030
WHEN DO THEY MEET THE STANDARD?

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:44.031
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO'S

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:46.267
TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY DO THEY

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.468
GET TO KILL SOMEONE IS IT

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:48.736
SUCCESSFUL.

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:51.138
SOMEONE DIES EVERY MILLION MILES

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:53.140
TWO MILLION MILES.

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:55.409
EVER ARE THEY ALLOWED EVER TO DO

01:31:55.476 --> 01:31:57.311
THAT I WOULD POSIT.

01:31:57.378 --> 01:31:58.613
THERE WERE GONNA GO TO FULLY

01:31:58.679 --> 01:32:00.147
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THEY SHOULD

01:32:00.214 --> 01:32:01.582
NEVER KILL PEOPLE.

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.251
ON.

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:05.653
WHAT ARE THEIR STANDARDS

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.188
THAT WERE ACTUALLY DOING THE

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:09.056
TESTING ANOTHER WORDS ARE WE

01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:10.958
TESTING THESE VEHICLES UNDER THE

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:13.594
REAL CONDITIONS OF OWNERSHIP?

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:14.495
THAT IS TO SAY ARE WE GONNA LET

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:16.631
THE CAR THE TIRES GO BALD ARE

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.299
PEOPLE GONNA FORGET TO MAINTAIN

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:19.767
THEM.

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:22.069
OR A WHAT IS THE REALITY OF THE

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:24.138
TESTING OR IS A MANUFACTURER

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:26.207
BASICALLY FREE TO TEST THE

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:28.843
PRISTINE VEHICLE IN PRISTINE.

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:30.478
CONDITIONS IN WHICH.

01:32:30.544 --> 01:32:33.180
THE OIL IS CHANGED AS OFTEN

01:32:33.247 --> 01:32:35.383
EXPOSED TO BE CHANGED BUT NOT AS

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:36.617
OFTEN AS IT MIGHT BE CHANGED IN

01:32:36.684 --> 01:32:39.153
THE REAL WORLD.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.455
ARE WE WERE REALLY PUSHING THESE

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:43.057
VEHICLES ANOTHER WORDS WHEN

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:45.326
THEY'RE TESTING RIGHT NOW FOR

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:46.794
EXAMPLE WHEN THEY'RE DRIVING

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.396
THESE VEHICLES AROUND SAN

01:32:48.462 --> 01:32:50.364
FRANCISCO IS SOMEBODY PAID TO

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:52.366
TRY TO HACK INTO ON EVERY SINGLE

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:54.535
DAY AND SEE IF THEY CAN. BREAK

01:32:54.602 --> 01:32:57.471
THEIR CYBERSECURITY.

01:32:57.538 --> 01:32:59.941
WHAT WHAT WHAT? OBJECTS ARE YOU

01:33:00.007 --> 01:33:01.309
THROWING IN FRONT OF THEM TO

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.710
MAKE SURE THEY DON'T RUN OVER

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:04.045
THEM ANOTHER WORDS.

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:06.113
SAFETY IS USUALLY A MARGIN OF

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:09.016
SAFETY BEYOND OF THEIR NORMAL WE

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.584
DON'T HAVE ANY MEASUREMENT FOR

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:12.687
ANY OF THAT AND YOU KURT THE DMV

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.422
PROPERLY SAY. WHAT WORLD WILL

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:15.790
JUST?

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:17.224
YOU KNOW APPROVE THESE THINGS

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:19.026
FOR TESTING IN CALIFORNIA OR

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.661
DEPLOYMENT IN CALIFORNIA WHEN

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:23.230
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES.

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:24.865
BOMB IT'S OKAY EXCEPT THE

01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:26.233
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS IN

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.836
FIGURING THIS OUT AT ALL.

01:33:28.903 --> 01:33:32.173
NOW.

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:34.008
HE THE LEGISLATURE MEAN FOR

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:38.145
EXAMPLE YOU GUYS SAID OR DUBBED.

01:33:38.212 --> 01:33:39.180
DMV SAID WELL WE'RE NOT READY TO

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:40.581
TEST COMMERCIAL VEHICLES THE

01:33:40.648 --> 01:33:41.782
LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY PASSED

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:43.684
TWO BILLS.

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:46.654
TO ALLOW THE TESTING OF BUSES.

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:50.257
ON HIGHWAYS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:52.126
HAVE NO STEERING WHEEL.

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:54.962
ON THAT HAVE NO BREAK.

01:33:55.029 --> 01:33:56.097
AND ARE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE ON

01:33:56.163 --> 01:33:57.198
THEM THEY'RE GONNA DOT THERE

01:33:57.264 --> 01:33:58.599
SUPPOSED TO BE THIS FIRST MILE

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:00.134
LAST MILE THING THAT GOES TWELVE

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:02.937
MILES AN HOUR. THE ENTITY THAT

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:04.872
IS IN CHARGE OF THE TESTING IS A

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:06.841
TRANSIT AGENCY. PEOPLE WITH

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:09.243
BASICALLY NO EXPERTISE ON HOW

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:10.678
YOU TEST

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:12.646
VEHICLES FOR SAFETY THAT'S NOT

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:13.948
WHAT THEY DO THEY BUY VEHICLES

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:16.550
ARE ALREADY APPROVED FOR TESTING.

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:17.551
AND BEING CONDUCTED BY THE

01:34:17.618 --> 01:34:19.453
MANUFACTURER WITH THEM WITH THAT

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.188
WITH ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:23.190
OUTCOME OF THE TESTING ALL ALONG

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:25.092
WITH THE TRANSIT AGENCY WHO DOES

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:26.894
A PRESS RELEASE SAYING WE'RE

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:28.262
GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:31.065
FUTURE. OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:32.833
THAT'S NOT WHO SHOULD BE TESTING

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.202
THESE THINGS SKEPTICS SHOULD BE

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:36.837
TESTING THE SEX

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:38.105
NOT PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANNOUNCED

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:39.473
THEIR THAT THEY'RE IN LOVE WITH

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:40.908
THE WHOLE THING. AND THEY'RE

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.143
GOING TO BE AT THE CENTER UP

01:34:42.209 --> 01:34:44.111
SOME FUTURE WORLD OF GOVERNMENT

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.713
ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN ADVANCE OF

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.982
THE TESTING.

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:49.583
SO THAT'S ALL HOLE PUT NUMBER OF

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:50.785
THE ISSUES THAT THAT HAVEN'T

01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:52.853
BEEN DEALT WITH THAT I THINK THE

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.823
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO GET INTO. I

01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:57.591
THINK YOU FOLKS NEED TO REALLY

01:34:57.658 --> 01:34:58.592
WAY INTO THIS.

01:34:58.659 --> 01:35:01.462
SECONDLY.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:04.198
AND I ALLUDED TO THIS.

01:35:04.265 --> 01:35:05.900
WORST WHAT'S THE REAL

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:07.735
TRANSPARENCY HERE

01:35:07.802 --> 01:35:08.469
WHAT IS STOP PUBLIC GET

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:11.572
TEN NO.

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:13.207
ABOUT THESE WOULD DO WE GET TO

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:14.408
KNOW EVERY COMPETE COMPUTER

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:16.410
FAILURE.

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:17.244
DO WE GET TO KNOW.

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:19.280
.

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:21.982
HOW OFTEN THERE'S?

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:24.552
UP POTENTIAL NEAR MESS I MEAN I

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:26.320
WHO KNOW WHO I DON'T KNOW I

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:27.421
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE REALLY KNOW I

01:35:27.488 --> 01:35:28.956
KNOW THAT THEY RELEASE WHEN

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.991
THERE'S AN ACCIDENT. WHEN

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:33.160
THERE'S AN INCIDENT BUT HEY

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:35.062
WE'VE ALL DRIVEN CARS THERE'S A

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:37.031
WHOLE LOT MORE MAYBE ALMOST

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:37.765
SORDID INCIDENTS.

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:39.500
THAT HAPPENED

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.669
WITH VEHICLES AND AS LONG AS

01:35:41.735 --> 01:35:43.671
PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE DRIVING

01:35:43.737 --> 01:35:45.206
VEHICLES AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:35:45.272 --> 01:35:46.874
SHARING THE ROAD WITH FULLY

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:49.009
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THERE'S

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:50.478
GOING TO BE A COLLISION. OF

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.213
TALENTS

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:53.614
AND LESS THAN COUNTS JUST AS THE

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:56.083
GENTLEMAN TO MY LEFT INDICATED.

01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:58.152
CARS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES MAY BE

01:35:58.219 --> 01:36:00.588
BETTER AT SOME THINGS AND PEOPLE

01:36:00.654 --> 01:36:02.890
MAY BE BETTER AT OTHER THINGS.

01:36:02.957 --> 01:36:05.159
AND THAT MADE NOT BE SOMETHING

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:07.728
THAT THE A COMPUTER WELL ALL

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:09.930
WILL BE ABLE TO OVERCOME.

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:11.632
AND AND SO THAT'S AN ISSUE WHAT

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:13.267
DO WE KNOW.

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:14.768
AND WHEN ARE WE GOING TO KNOW IT

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:17.371
AND LASTLY AND THIS IS A CLASSIC

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:20.241
AREA OF LEGISLATIVE. ACTIVITY.

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:22.143
WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE IN

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:23.878
THE LIABILITY INSURANCE MARKET

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:26.747
RELATED TO THIS?

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.249
WHAT DO ARE WE ALL SUPPOSED TO

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:29.917
BUY?

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.852
AUTO INSURANCE.

01:36:31.919 --> 01:36:34.522
ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE.

01:36:34.588 --> 01:36:36.924
IN WHICH WE DON'T OPERATE IT.

01:36:36.991 --> 01:36:38.959
WHEN THE RISK OF THE INSURANCE

01:36:39.026 --> 01:36:40.361
IS SUPPOSED TO BE ENSURING US

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:43.097
AGAINST OUR NEGLIGENCE.

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:45.499
IS THAT FAIR.

01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:47.101
OR SHOULD ALL THIS BE. A

01:36:47.168 --> 01:36:49.236
WARRANTY OF THE MANUFACTURER

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:51.071
SHOULD IF BIG CANDLES OF FULLY

01:36:51.138 --> 01:36:52.973
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE WHY AREN'T

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.709
THEY A HUNDRED PERCENT LIABLE.

01:36:55.776 --> 01:36:57.778
STRICTLY LIABLE IN TORT FOR ANY

01:36:57.845 --> 01:36:59.980
ACCIDENT THAT OCCURS IT'S NOT

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:02.049
MONEY DRIVING ERROR.

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:03.651
AYE SHOULD BE PAYING INSURANCE

01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:04.552
FOR SOMETHING THAT'S

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:06.620
ATTRIBUTABLE TO ME.

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:07.354
NOT TO A FAILURE OF THE

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:09.323
MANUFACTURE.

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:11.458
NONE AND SO THAT IS AN AREA THAT

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:12.760
THE LEGISLATURE REALLY OUGHT TO

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:14.161
BE LOOKING AT.

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:15.596
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:17.231
OF THESE COMPANIES.

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:19.300
SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE.

01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:21.235
.

01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:23.037
DEPLOYING THESE VEHICLES AS SOON

01:37:23.103 --> 01:37:25.339
AS THEY CAN.

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:27.441
AND THAT COULD BE.

01:37:27.508 --> 01:37:30.144
WHAT WITHIN A YEAR TO YEAR TOP

01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:31.412
WHEN ARE THEY ACTUALLY GOING TO

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.613
BE DOING IT?

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.315
AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN WE

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:35.149
HAVEN'T EVEN LOOKED AT THESE

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:36.417
ISSUES.

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:38.319
SO.

01:37:38.385 --> 01:37:39.887
HOME YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT OLD

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:40.754
STATEMENT.

YOU KNOW FOOLS RUSH IN WHERE

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:44.992
ANGELS DARE TO TREAD AND I THINK

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:46.327
IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT.

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:47.995
IT'S BEEN SAID TODAY BY

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:49.496
EVERYBODY ON THIS PANEL AND

01:37:49.563 --> 01:37:51.632
EVERYBODY ON THE PANEL BEFORE.

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.834
YOU KNOW A A A A A TRUER

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:55.102
STATEMENT WAS NEVER MADE THANK

01:37:58.339 --> 01:37:59.707

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:01.208
GLAZER JONES CAN GET RID.

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:03.277
MISTER BERMAN HAD A COUPLE

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:04.144
QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL WELL

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:05.412
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH IN AND I

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:06.480
APOLOGIZE AFTER THE BRIEF

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:08.249
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO FOR A PREP

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:09.083
CALL FOR.

01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:10.484
THOMAS VEHICLE PENAL I'M

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:12.119
SERVING ON THE MORROW.

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:15.489
BUT I THINK IT'S SOME VERY GOOD

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:17.791
QUESTIONS IN ISSUES WERE RAISED.

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.426
AND I WISH I'M GONNA TRY TO

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:22.129
MAKE IT BACK. TO HEAR FROM THE.

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:23.931
FROM THE THIRD PANEL HOPEFULLY

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:25.065
THEY ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:38:25.132 --> 01:38:25.899
CONCERNS I MEAN THERE ARE

01:38:25.966 --> 01:38:28.702
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS. ABOUT

01:38:28.769 --> 01:38:29.837
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND I THINK.

01:38:29.903 --> 01:38:31.338
THERE ARE THRESHOLD QUESTIONS

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:33.107
ONE IS ARE THEY GONNA BE GOOD

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:34.908
FOR SOCIETY OR ARE THEY GONNA BE

01:38:34.975 --> 01:38:37.311
THAT NEXT STEP OF THE APOCALYPSE.

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:39.146
ON AND WHAT YOU GET PAST THAT IF

01:38:39.213 --> 01:38:40.681
YOU CAN GET PAST THAT THEN THERE

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:41.849
ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS AS TO HOW

01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:43.217
YOU DEPLOY IT HOW YOU TO PLAY IT

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:45.452
SAFELY. I GIVE MY FIRST HEAD X.

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:46.754
TALKING TO THOMAS VEHICLES FOR

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.988
YEARS AGO.

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:50.257
AND AND. TALKED TO A LOT OF

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:52.159
PEOPLE IT IN PREP FOR FOR

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:53.360
PUTTING TOGETHER THE TALK WHO

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:54.895
HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:56.497
CYBERSECURITY I MEAN ABOUT

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:57.364
HACKING.

01:38:57.431 --> 01:39:00.000
ABOUT PRIVACY ABOUT WE NEED TO

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:01.502
COME UP IN AND CREATE A

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:02.903
REGULATORY AND INSURANCE

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.571
FRAMEWORK AND HOW THAT'S GONNA.

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.707
AGO WHEN ALL I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:07.708
MY FRIEND MR BROAD.

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:11.011
AS YOU KNOW EMPHASIZE THE

01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:11.645
IMPORTANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:11.812
THAT

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:13.213
BECAUSE LAST YEAR WHEN I HAD A

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.416
BILL ON TRYING TO CREATE A

01:39:15.482 --> 01:39:17.084
TESTING PROGRAM FOR A THOMAS

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:18.852
FREIGHT. ó IT WAS OPPOSED

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:20.387
VEHEMENTLY BY MY FRIEND MISTER

01:39:20.454 --> 01:39:21.088
BROAD.

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:23.123
AS WELL AS BY THE TECHNOLOGY

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:24.525
INDUSTRY SO I FOUND MYSELF IN

01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:25.359
THIS AWESOME SITUATION WHERE

01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:27.027
EVERYONE HATED MY.

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:29.630
BUT BUT I DO THINK IT'S A ROLE

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:30.964
THAT WE NEED TO PLAY I THINK WE

01:39:31.031 --> 01:39:32.466
NEED PARTNERS

01:39:32.533 --> 01:39:34.435
FROM ALL SIDES TO PARTICIPATE

01:39:34.501 --> 01:39:35.035
CONSTRUCTIVELY IN THAT

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.937
CONVERSATION.

01:39:37.004 --> 01:39:39.106
AND AND YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:40.808
FOLKS TALK ABOUT SAFETY AND AND

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:43.310
A.

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:46.213
IT BROUGHT UP THE QUESTION.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.048
YEAH I'M VERY YOU MENTIONED YOU

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:49.083
KNOW WHAT'S OF THE SAFETY

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:50.517
STANDARD BE AND IF IT TOO IF

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:51.885
YOU'RE FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

01:39:51.952 --> 01:39:53.654
SHOULD THERE BE NO DEATHS.

01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:54.988
ALRIGHT WELL CURRENTLY WE HAVE

01:39:55.055 --> 01:39:57.491
THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DEATHS BY

01:39:57.558 --> 01:39:59.793
AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT EVERY YEAR

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:01.395
IN IN THE UNITED STATES SO

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:01.929
THAT'S THE STATE THAT'S.

01:40:01.995 --> 01:40:03.997
KIND OF.

01:40:04.064 --> 01:40:04.431
THE.

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:06.867
THE BASELINE IF YOU WILL

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:08.369
AND AND SO THIRTY FOR THIRTY

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:09.803
SEVEN THOUSAND WE'VE ACCEPTED

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:11.472
THAT IS THAT'S OKAY.

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:12.740
IT'S OKAY FOR THIRTY SEVEN

01:40:12.806 --> 01:40:14.541
THOUSAND PEOPLE TO DIE EVERY

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:16.243
YEAR BECAUSE PEOPLE MAKE

01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:17.511
MISTAKES AND CRASH INTO EACH

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:18.779
OTHER.

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:20.781
AND.

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:23.584
SO IS IS A LIFE THAT'S TAKING IN

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:26.186
BECAUSE OVER HUMAN ACCIDENT

01:40:26.253 --> 01:40:27.988
WORTH LAST THEN A LIFE THAT

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:29.456
WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE THEN

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:31.692
ACCIDENT FROM TECHNOLOGY.

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:33.160
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAY

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:36.163
THAT THAT IF ONE ACCIDENT YEAH I

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:37.831
MEAN OF ONE PERSON DIES FROM A

01:40:37.898 --> 01:40:40.134
THOMAS VEHICLES THAT'S TOO MUCH

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.302
OR WHAT'S THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND.

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:43.804
BECAUSE THAT WAY TOO MUCH I

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:45.639
APPRECIATE THAT AND SO YOU KNOW

01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:48.409
HOW CAN WE. ARE ON AYE AND AND

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:51.145
THEN I I AM. TOTALLY AGREE WE

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:52.846
NEED TO BE COGNIZANT.

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:53.514
OF THE IMPACT IT'S GOING TO HAVE

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.649
ON JOBS WE NEED TO AND AND THE

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:56.984
TEAMSTERS AND I ACTUALLY WORK

01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:58.652
TOGETHER A WITH A TECHNOLOGY

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:00.387
COMPANY IN MY DISTRICT.

01:41:00.454 --> 01:41:01.288
ON ON.

01:41:01.922 --> 01:41:04.458
PLATOONING TECHNOLOGY IN TRUCKS

01:41:04.525 --> 01:41:05.058
AND I THOUGHT WE HAD A GREAT

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:06.026
CONVERSATION AND WAS REALLY GLAD

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:07.327
YEAH THERE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:08.362
TO DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY BUT NOT

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:09.997
IMPACT JOBS.

01:41:10.063 --> 01:41:11.398
AND SO THERE NEED TO BE THOSE

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:13.066
CONVERSATIONS ALSO BUT.

01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:15.102
YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S KEEP

01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:16.637
THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE.

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:18.172
AND AND FOR ME.

01:41:18.238 --> 01:41:20.307
YOU KNOW IT YOU THIRTY SEVEN

01:41:20.374 --> 01:41:22.009
THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING EVERY YEAR

01:41:22.075 --> 01:41:23.877
IS WAY TOO MUCH.

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:25.779
A AND I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:41:25.846 --> 01:41:28.115
DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY VERY CAREFULLY.

01:41:28.182 --> 01:41:29.716
AYE AYE SAID THIS FOUR YEARS

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:30.984
AGO THAT.

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.186
THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:33.554
READY WAY BEFORE WHAT WAY

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.122
EARLIER THAN WE ARE.

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:36.557
AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:37.758
DEFINITELY THE CASE.

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:40.160
BUT LET'S LET'S KIND OF YOU

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:41.662
KNOW TRY TO KEEP THE BIG PICTURE

01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:42.930
IN MIND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:44.798
SOME THESE ISSUES SO I APOLOGIZE

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:45.899
AFTER RUNNING TO TRY TO MAKE IT

01:41:45.966 --> 01:41:47.134
BACK OF THIS VEHICLE CALL. OF

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:48.802
THE THANK YOU AND REALLY LOOK

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:49.269
FORWARD TO A LOT MORE

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:50.003
CONVERSATIONS.

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:51.071
HE'S MOVING FORWARD.

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:53.106
THANK YOU MISTER BURN.

01:41:53.173 --> 01:41:54.441
A MISTER I KANSEN CHU.

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:56.076
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:41:56.143 --> 01:41:57.611
IT WAS SO VERY LIVELY

01:41:57.678 --> 01:41:59.046
DISCUSSION

01:41:59.112 --> 01:42:00.214
AND YOU KNOW THAT THEIR

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.716
TECHNOLOGIES THIS EVOLVING EVERY

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:05.018
DAY. AND WELL WE CAN'T

01:42:05.085 --> 01:42:07.821
ANTICIPATE. THAT DOES SOME DAY

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.990
YOU ALL THE TRUCKS ON THE ROAD

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:12.893
WILL BE A YOU KNOW A LOT OF SELF

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:13.794
DRIVING AUTONOMOUS.

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:17.097
AND MY CONCERN WAS TOO GOOD TEN

01:42:17.164 --> 01:42:19.266
THOUSAND THOUSANDS HOPE A.

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:21.602
LITTLE TOO SLOW TRUCK DRIVERS

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:23.837
AND AND GO WILL SO I WOULD LIKE

01:42:23.904 --> 01:42:25.205
TO. MAYBE.

01:42:25.305 --> 01:42:29.076
MISS HER BROW CAN TOUCH LITTLE

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:30.577
BIT ALCOHOL.

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:33.013
SURE WE HOW CAN WE AS THE STATE

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:34.815
LEGISLATURE TO.

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:37.351
TWO OF THE TO CONSIDER HELPING

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:39.052
THOSE WHO ARE CURRENT.

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:40.487
WORK FORCE SOONER DROPPED THE

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:41.922
TRUCK DRIVERS

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:43.323
TO TRANSITION INTO OTHER

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:48.095
PROFESSIONS.

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:50.230
WELL IT'S PROBABLY. BEYOND THE

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:52.032
SCOPE OF THIS HEARING BUT AND

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:53.500
BECAUSE IT'S A BIG TOPIC AND

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:55.369
THAT THAT THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT.

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:56.670
IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS

01:42:56.737 --> 01:42:58.572
DEPENDING ON THE ROLL OUT OF

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:00.574
THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT SOMEWHERE

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:01.942
AROUND TEN MILLION PEOPLE WILL

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:04.211
LOSE THEIR JOBS.

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:06.813
JOHN THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:07.981
AND THEN IN IN MANY OTHER

01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:09.850
INDUSTRIES SO THE QUESTION IS

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.251
WHETHER DO YOU TRAIN THEM FOR

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:13.053
ANOTHER INDUSTRY.

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:13.954
YOU GIVE THEM SORT OF JOB

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:15.022
TRAINING THAT'S SORT OF THE

01:43:15.088 --> 01:43:17.391
TRADITIONAL.

01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:19.126
THING STRATEGY.

01:43:19.192 --> 01:43:20.761
UPON IT MAY NOT BE A STRATEGY

01:43:20.827 --> 01:43:22.429
THAT WORKS.

01:43:22.496 --> 01:43:24.331
IF WERE FACING A FUTURE IN WHICH

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:26.400
THERE ARE.

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:28.101
THERE'S NO JOBS TO GO TO IN

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:30.671
OTHER WORDS IF YOU KEEP.

01:43:30.737 --> 01:43:32.372
IF THE PACE OF AUTOMATION YOU

01:43:32.439 --> 01:43:33.173
KNOW FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.841
NINETEENTH CENTURY TO NOW IS

01:43:34.908 --> 01:43:36.577
LIKE THIS WE MAY HAVE A PACE OF

01:43:36.643 --> 01:43:38.445
AUTOMATION THAT GOES LIKE THIS.

01:43:38.512 --> 01:43:39.713
AND WE MAY BE FACING SOMETHING

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:40.914
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT IN OUR

01:43:40.981 --> 01:43:42.683
SOCIETY WHICH FUTURE

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:45.319
LEGISLATURE'S BUT MAYBE THAT NOT.

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:47.020
FOR THAT NOT THAT FAR IN THE

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:49.489
FUTURE WILL BE FACING WHICH IS.

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.892
THE IDEA THAT THERE WILL BE.

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:53.860
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

01:43:53.927 --> 01:43:56.063
WHO ARE DETACHED PERMANENTLY

01:43:56.129 --> 01:43:57.164
FROM THE LABOR MARKET.

01:43:57.230 --> 01:43:58.699
AND

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:00.534
THE LOOPHOLE CONCEPT OF THE

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:01.635
LABOR THEORY OF VALUE WILL BE

01:44:01.702 --> 01:44:03.337
UNDER CHALLENGE

01:44:03.403 --> 01:44:04.705
SO I'D LIKE TO SAY IT'S EASY TO

01:44:04.771 --> 01:44:07.741
SAY TRAIN PEOPLE FOR ANOTHER JOB.

01:44:07.808 --> 01:44:10.143
BUT THERE MAY NOT BE ANOTHER JOB.

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.878
BECAUSE THAT GOES AUTONOMOUS

01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:13.914
VEHICLES ARE NOT THE ONLY PLACE

01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:15.616
WHERE AUTOMATION IS OCCURRING

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:18.251
IT'S OCCURRING. EVERYWHERE

01:44:18.318 --> 01:44:20.253
ACROSS THE ECONOMY VERY BROADLY

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.155
FROM.

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:24.091
YOU KNOW FARMWORKERS TO

01:44:24.157 --> 01:44:25.926
RESTAURANTS TO HOTELS TO AIRPORT

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:27.294
MEETS EVERYWHERE

01:44:27.361 --> 01:44:30.263
AND WOULD BE NAIVE TO THINK THAT.

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:32.599
THAT YOU KNOW TEACHING IT IT'S

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.534
WE NOT NAIVE TO THINK THAT THAT

01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:36.570
GENERAL TREND WILL NOT.

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:37.904
MUCH CHANGE IN WE MAY HAVE TO

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:40.507
THINK MUCH IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY

01:44:40.574 --> 01:44:42.476
AND WAY MORE CREATIVELY THAN

01:44:42.542 --> 01:44:44.177
JUST DRAW JOB TRAINING I I CAN'T

01:44:44.244 --> 01:44:46.013
TELL YOU AS I SIT HERE TODAY AND

01:44:46.079 --> 01:44:47.547
I I MEAN THAT'S VERY SINCERELY.

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:48.915
I CAN'T TELL YOU AS I SIT HERE

01:44:48.982 --> 01:44:50.951
TODAY WHAT THE ANSWER IS TO THAT

01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:52.486
PROBLEM.

01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:54.421
MIDDLE ONE TRADITIONAL ANSWER

01:44:54.488 --> 01:44:56.857
FRANKLY WAS THAT'S HOW THEY WENT

01:44:56.923 --> 01:44:58.859
FROM THE SIXTY HOUR WORK WEEK TO

01:44:58.925 --> 01:45:00.761
THE FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK DURING

01:45:00.827 --> 01:45:01.995
ANOTHER PERIOD OF INTENSE

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:03.930
AUTOMATION AND WHICH THEY SPREAD

01:45:03.997 --> 01:45:05.632
THE WORK AROUND.

01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:07.234
THAT WAS PART OF IT TO MAKE

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.902
PEOPLE WORK LAST TO HAVE A

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:10.737
BETTER LIFE AND TO SHORTEN THE

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:13.173
WORK WEEK AND IN GERMANY NOW

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:15.542
THERE ARE ON THIS THE. BIG

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:17.344
INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING

01:45:17.411 --> 01:45:19.046
EMPLOYERS AND THEIR UNIONS

01:45:19.112 --> 01:45:19.680
BECAUSE THEY DO SECTOR

01:45:19.746 --> 01:45:22.783
BARGAINING. JUST AGREED TO I

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:24.284
BELIEVE IT'S THE TWENTY EIGHT

01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:26.019
HOUR WORK WEEK.

01:45:26.086 --> 01:45:28.889
AS A FULL AS A FULL TIME JOB.

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:30.023
BECAUSE OF THE ADVANCE OF

01:45:30.090 --> 01:45:32.492
TECHNOLOGY FOR THIS PURPOSE AND

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:34.194
WHILE THAT MIGHT SOUND.

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:36.496
WAY OUT THERE.

01:45:36.563 --> 01:45:38.632
IT MAYBE IT ISN'T MAYBE WHAT WE

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:40.701
HAVE TO DO IS SPREAD WORK TO THE

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:43.036
ENTIRE POPULATION AS THE NUMBER

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:44.805
LITERALLY THE NUMBER OF JOBS TO

01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:47.441
BE PERFORMED BY HUMAN.

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:49.076
SO I I WISH I HAD A PAT ANSWER

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:49.609
FOR YOU.

01:45:49.676 --> 01:45:52.946
BUT I DON'T.

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:55.916
FONG.

01:45:55.982 --> 01:45:56.883
UP I.

01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:58.218
I APPRECIATE THE PANEL I THINK

01:45:58.285 --> 01:45:59.386
YOU.

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:01.121
PROVIDED SOME VERY LARGE.

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:02.689
CONCEPTUAL CONCEPTS THAT WE

01:46:02.756 --> 01:46:04.558
HAVE TO DIGEST IN AND.

01:46:04.624 --> 01:46:06.159
REPREHENSIBLE AND I GUESS WE

01:46:06.226 --> 01:46:07.627
CAN MAKE A DRILL DOWN WITH AT

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:08.762
LEAST WITH THE INSURANCE HAVE

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:10.630
FOLKS. WHAT CRITERIA ARE YOU

01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:12.532
GUYS YOU UTILIZING OR HAVE

01:46:12.599 --> 01:46:15.001
DEVELOPED TO AND? IN TERMS OF

01:46:15.068 --> 01:46:15.802
ENSURING AUTOMATED.

01:46:15.869 --> 01:46:17.104
VEHICLES ON THE ROADS

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:19.539
IF YOU HAVE THAT.

01:46:19.606 --> 01:46:20.774
I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT THAT IS

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:22.175
PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:46:22.242 --> 01:46:23.710
UNDERSTANDING THE TECHNOLOGY

01:46:23.777 --> 01:46:25.879
ITSELF WE CERTAINLY ARE IT IT'S

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:27.748
IT MIGHT ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:29.382
ARE BOTH COMMERCIAL INSURERS AND

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:30.617
PERSONAL INSURANCE I THINK ONCE

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:32.786
WE SEE PUBLIC DEPLOYMENT. OF

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:33.420
THESE IN OUR ARE THERE ACTUALLY

01:46:33.487 --> 01:46:35.956
SOLD ON TO INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL

01:46:36.022 --> 01:46:38.658
SEE THAT INVOLVING THINK WE SEE

01:46:38.725 --> 01:46:39.226
THAT COMING AND AND WE DON'T

01:46:39.292 --> 01:46:40.093
KNOW RIGHT NOW

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:40.460
IS THE ANSWER.

01:46:40.527 --> 01:46:42.629
WERE WERE. OBSERVING.

01:46:42.696 --> 01:46:44.731
THE TEST JUST LIKE EVERYBODY

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:45.732
ELSE TO FIGURE OUT.

01:46:45.799 --> 01:46:47.734
WHAT THE PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE IT

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:49.469
THINK MISTER BROAD? BROUGHT UP

01:46:49.536 --> 01:46:50.837
BUT THE STINK WHITE WE COULD

01:46:50.904 --> 01:46:52.305
DEEP DIVE I THINK IN JUST THE

01:46:52.372 --> 01:46:53.774
LIABILITY ISSUES.

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.408
AND HOW THAT WORKS OUT WITH ON

01:46:55.475 --> 01:46:56.810
SADDAM ITS VEHICLES A. AND MAY

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.178
PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE

01:46:58.245 --> 01:46:59.713
HEARING TODAY. WE'RE TRYING TO

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:00.413
UNDERSTAND.

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.150
THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF AND THE

01:47:03.216 --> 01:47:03.884
NOW THAT'S GOING TO INTEGRATE

01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:05.485
WITH OUR CURRENT TOWARD.

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:07.888
LIABILITY SYSTEM THAT WE USE.

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:09.589
IN THE IN THE BOTH PERSONAL CO

01:47:09.656 --> 01:47:11.625
COMMERCIAL AROUND SO I YOU KNOW

01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:12.559
THAT THE CRITERIA TO ANSWER

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.227
QUESTIONS. OF I DON'T KNOW WE'RE

01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:15.962
LOOKING AT I THINK LIKE

01:47:16.029 --> 01:47:17.597
EVERYBODY ELSE INTERESTED ON

01:47:17.664 --> 01:47:18.498
STAKEHOLDERS.

01:47:18.565 --> 01:47:20.400
AS TO THE THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:47:20.467 --> 01:47:21.668
THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:23.637
TO BE CLEAR WERE BULLISH ON AND

01:47:23.703 --> 01:47:25.605
AND WE THINK THAT IT'S SOMETHING.

01:47:25.672 --> 01:47:26.006
THAT.

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:28.408
KING CAN CREATE MORE STICK IT

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:30.443
EVENTUALLY CAN BECOME AND SAFER

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:33.713
AND MORE EFFICIENT ALWAYS TRAVEL.

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:35.081
IN IN ENTERS OF THE JUST WILL

01:47:35.148 --> 01:47:36.116
QUICKLY INTO THIS THE

01:47:36.183 --> 01:47:37.517
STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS OF WHO'S

01:47:37.584 --> 01:47:38.952
INVOLVED IN INTERNET THE STATE.

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:40.220
I MEAN THAT YOU'RE MORE MORE

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:41.421
GENERALLY SPEAKING SO I THINK

01:47:41.488 --> 01:47:42.222
EVERYBODY'S

01:47:42.289 --> 01:47:44.324
WE HEAR FROM CONSUMER ADVOCATES

01:47:44.391 --> 01:47:45.859
INSURERS MANUFACTURERS

01:47:45.926 --> 01:47:47.794
TECHNOLOGY GROUPS EXCEPT.

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:49.729
OKAY THANK YOU BYE AYE I THINK

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:51.598
BROADLY OUT OF SAY THAT WE WE

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:53.500
ARE GOING TO SOME TYPE OF YOU

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:54.768
KNOW INDEX REVOLUTION THERE'S

01:47:54.835 --> 01:47:55.735
GOING TO BE. TECHNOLOGY

01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:56.903
ADVANCEMENTS PROBABLY THAT'S

01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:58.705
GONNA HAPPEN I I DO GOODNESS

01:47:58.772 --> 01:47:59.406
BROUGHT THAT.

01:47:59.472 --> 01:48:01.541
IN THEN IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:03.276
OF THE JUSTICE.

01:48:03.343 --> 01:48:05.111
INNOVATIVE IN THE PAST FIFTY.

01:48:05.178 --> 01:48:07.147
I THINK WE DO HAVE TO. FIND A

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:08.715
WAY TO PRIORITIZE SAFETY AS

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:10.851
VISIT IN SPECIFICS WITH WITH

01:48:10.917 --> 01:48:11.551
AUTOMATED.

01:48:11.618 --> 01:48:13.753
VEHICLES AS WELL AS JOBS

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:15.722
INNOVATION AND KILL OUR STATE

01:48:15.789 --> 01:48:16.590
HAS A LONG HISTORY OF IT

01:48:16.656 --> 01:48:18.558
INNOVATION THAT WE. THAT WE NEED

01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:20.293
TO CONTINUE TO BE LATER ON AND

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:23.029
SO I'M NOT SURE IF WE WILL AS A

01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:24.030
LEGISLATURE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:48:24.097 --> 01:48:25.265
THAT WE DON'T STIFLE INNOVATION

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:26.366
BUT ALSO MAINTAIN.

01:48:26.433 --> 01:48:27.334
SET TYPE OF.

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.569
ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT.

01:48:29.636 --> 01:48:31.805
INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE ECONOMIC

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:35.876
OPPORTUNITY TO TO TO UP TO LIVE

01:48:35.942 --> 01:48:36.476
LOOK AT THE STATE SO THANK YOU

01:48:36.543 --> 01:48:39.446
VERY MUCH.

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:41.181
THANK YOU MISTER PHONE CONSUMER

01:48:41.248 --> 01:48:42.549
GOODS SETH.

01:48:42.616 --> 01:48:44.017
SO DO YOU THINK THE UTOMOTIVE

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:45.619
INDUSTRY IS DOING ENOUGH.

01:48:45.685 --> 01:48:46.987
I TO PROTECT ITS VEHICLES FROM

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:50.724
HACKING AT THIS POINT.

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:52.659
SO IT DIFFICULT TO SAY PARTLY

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:53.827
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:55.495
UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS IN.

01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:57.264
INFORMATION SECURITY.

01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:58.798
AND THERE ARE SO MANY ENTIRE

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.200
CLASSES OF VULNERABILITIES THAT

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:01.434
ARE STILL BEING DISCOVERED.

01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:03.904
.

01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:05.472
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

01:49:05.538 --> 01:49:06.072
THEY'RE WORKING PRETTY HARD ON

01:49:06.139 --> 01:49:06.706
IT.

01:49:06.773 --> 01:49:08.008
I THINK.

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:10.043
SINCE.

01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:12.445
THE FIELD IS SO NEW THERE'S JUST

01:49:12.512 --> 01:49:14.648
A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY OUT THERE.

01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:16.816
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:18.551
COLLABORATION WITH INDEPENDENT

01:49:18.618 --> 01:49:20.387
RESEARCHERS ON WITH ACADEMIC

01:49:20.453 --> 01:49:21.855
RESEARCHERS WHO ARE OFTEN PEOPLE

01:49:21.922 --> 01:49:23.023
WHOM WE REPRESENT AND GIVE LEGAL

01:49:23.089 --> 01:49:24.791
ADVICE TO.

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:25.825
WHO ARE ALSO WORKING IN THIS

01:49:25.892 --> 01:49:26.893
AREA AND WHO ARE OFTEN THE ONES

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:28.495
WHO DISCOVER?

01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:30.330
SOME OF THE NEW THINGS THAT

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.032
PEOPLE NEED TO BE WORRYING ABOUT.

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:33.633
I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:34.901
SUGGEST THAT THE MANUFACTURERS

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:36.436
ARE JUST SORT OF.

01:49:36.503 --> 01:49:38.705
FALLING ASLEEP AND.

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:40.807
COMPLETELY IGNORING THE ISSUE IN

01:49:40.874 --> 01:49:41.441
FACT THEY'RE WORKING ON IT QUITE

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:42.609
HARD.

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:44.411
THERE'S JUST SORT OF THE

01:49:44.477 --> 01:49:47.180
UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS PHENOMENON OF.

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:49.816
IS THAT ENOUGH.

01:49:49.883 --> 01:49:52.953
WHAT IS NECESSARY?

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:53.286
SO IS THERE A.

01:49:53.353 --> 01:49:55.455
.

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:56.556
POSSIBILITY CREATED A COMPUTER

01:49:56.623 --> 01:49:58.191
SYSTEM THOSE.

01:49:58.258 --> 01:50:00.593
CRASH PROOF.

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.595
SO I THOUGHT IT'S INTERESTING TO

01:50:02.662 --> 01:50:04.130
COMPARE WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF.

01:50:04.197 --> 01:50:06.099
.

01:50:06.166 --> 01:50:08.101
AVIATION.

01:50:08.168 --> 01:50:10.770
WHICH HAS HAD AUTONOMOUS.

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:12.472
SOFTWARE CONTROLLED NAVIGATION

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:14.674
FOR A LONG TIME NOW.

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:15.608
AND A LOT OF THE TIME WHEN

01:50:15.675 --> 01:50:16.643
YOU'RE ON A COMMERCIAL.

01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:18.945
AIRLINE.

01:50:19.012 --> 01:50:20.380
THE PILOT IS NOT IN FACT

01:50:20.447 --> 01:50:21.281
DIRECTLY INTERACTIVELY

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:22.949
CONTROLLING.

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:24.117
THE MOVEMENT OF THE AIRPLANE

01:50:24.184 --> 01:50:25.018
BECAUSE THE AUTO PILOTS ARE VERY

01:50:25.085 --> 01:50:26.586
EFFECTIVE.

01:50:26.653 --> 01:50:27.187
AND THEY'RE USED A LOT OF THE

01:50:27.253 --> 01:50:28.088
TIME.

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:29.656
NOW.

01:50:29.723 --> 01:50:31.624
THE.

01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:33.360
IF YOU ISSUE INDUSTRY IS VERY

01:50:33.426 --> 01:50:34.894
VERY HIGHLY REGULATED. AND

01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:36.129
THEY'VE SPENT ENORMOUS AMOUNTS

01:50:36.196 --> 01:50:37.564
OF MONEY ON SOFTWARE QUALITY

01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:39.132
ASSURANCE.

01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:40.934
THAT'S REALLY THE ENVY OF THE

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:43.503
REST OF THE IT WORLD.

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:45.939
AND.

01:50:46.006 --> 01:50:47.040
I THINK THERE IS A QUESTION

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.341
ABOUT WHETHER THAT KIND OF LEVEL

01:50:48.408 --> 01:50:49.676
OF INVESTMENT.

01:50:49.743 --> 01:50:50.744
IN QUALITY ASSURANCE

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.779
IS.

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:55.281
NECESSARY IN ORDER TO REACH THAT

01:50:55.348 --> 01:50:56.750
LEVEL OF ASSURANCE BECAUSE THEY.

01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:58.418
THEY'VE REACHED A VERY

01:50:58.485 --> 01:50:59.652
ADMIRABLE SAFETY RECORD

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:01.054
INCLUDING FOR AUTONOMOUS PHASES

01:51:01.121 --> 01:51:03.556
OF FLIGHT.

01:51:03.623 --> 01:51:04.858
AND THEY'VE REACHED THAT BY

01:51:04.924 --> 01:51:06.192
SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:07.260
AND A GREAT DEAL OF ENGINEERING

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:08.762
EFFORT ON THAT AND SO I THINK

01:51:08.828 --> 01:51:10.130
THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER

01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:11.698
THAT LEVEL OF ASSURANCE.

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:13.400
IS GOING TO REQUIRE PUTTING

01:51:13.466 --> 01:51:15.602
INCOMPARABLE RESOURCES

01:51:15.668 --> 01:51:17.604
IN THE AUTOMOTIVE FIELD AS WELL.

01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:18.872
HA AND I THINK IT MAY TURN OUT

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:20.173
THAT IT DOES WHICH MAY BE A BIT

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.708
UNCOMFORTABLE.

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:22.876
TO PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE

01:51:22.942 --> 01:51:24.444
USED TO JUST SORT OF SITTING

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:25.078
DOWN AND KNOCKING OUT A COMPUTER

01:51:25.145 --> 01:51:26.246
PROGRAM.

01:51:26.312 --> 01:51:27.280
NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S WHAT

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:28.181
THE SELF DRIVING

01:51:28.248 --> 01:51:29.049
SOFTWARE IS LIKE.

01:51:29.115 --> 01:51:31.151
BUT.

01:51:31.217 --> 01:51:32.852
THE AVIATION PEOPLE I MEAN YOU

01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:34.621
CAN TALK TO SOME OF THEM.

01:51:34.687 --> 01:51:36.322
THEY WRITE FORMAL SPECIFICATIONS

01:51:36.389 --> 01:51:37.857
AND THEY HAVE SO MANY FORMAL

01:51:37.924 --> 01:51:39.659
PROCESSES AND SO MANY TOOLS.

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:40.593
TO REALLY GET THE BUGS OUT OF

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:41.628
THEIR SOFTWARE.

01:51:41.694 --> 01:51:43.329
AT GREAT EXPENSE

01:51:43.396 --> 01:51:45.598
HAND IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE THAT

01:51:45.665 --> 01:51:47.801
FOR. THAT LEVEL OF RELIABILITY

01:51:47.867 --> 01:51:49.369
THAT WE EFFECTIVELY NEED TO GO

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:49.869
THERE WITH THAT KIND OF

01:51:49.936 --> 01:51:50.637
METHODOLOGY.

01:51:50.703 --> 01:51:52.839
THANK YOU.

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:55.542
SO ROSEMARY.

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:56.176
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING IMPATIENTLY

01:51:56.242 --> 01:51:57.944
THANK YOU.

01:51:58.011 --> 01:51:59.379
ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL STEPS

01:51:59.446 --> 01:52:00.680
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE TAKEN TO

01:52:00.747 --> 01:52:02.549
ENSURE THE SAFE TESTING.

01:52:02.615 --> 01:52:04.150
AUTOMATED.

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:06.820
AUTOMATED OF VEHICLES.

01:52:06.886 --> 01:52:07.554
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:09.089
QUESTION CHAIRMAN FRAZIER.

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:12.258
WE HAVE RECOMMENDED SEVERAL

01:52:12.325 --> 01:52:14.761
THINGS THAT WE AS A STATE CAN DO.

01:52:14.828 --> 01:52:18.765
TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND NUMBER

01:52:18.832 --> 01:52:20.967
ONE WOULD BE. TO REQUIRE A

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:22.869
RIGOROUSLY PROVEN TRACK RECORD

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:24.904
OF SAFE OPERATION WITHOUT

01:52:24.971 --> 01:52:26.473
DISENGAGEMENT IN ALL KINDS OF

01:52:26.539 --> 01:52:28.041
TRAFFIC CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS

01:52:28.108 --> 01:52:30.009
WEATHER CONDITIONS. INCLUDING

01:52:30.076 --> 01:52:32.645
FOG RAIN HEAVY SMOKE AND SNOW

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:35.048
BECAUSE. EVEN THOUGH IT'S ALMOST

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:36.216
ALWAYS GORGEOUS AND SUNNY IN

01:52:36.282 --> 01:52:37.283
CALIFORNIA.

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:39.119
WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT WEATHER

01:52:39.185 --> 01:52:41.421
PATTERNS AND AND WITH CLIMATE

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:43.223
CHANGE ESPECIALLY WHERE YOU SEE

01:52:43.289 --> 01:52:43.890
MORE OF THAT.

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:46.025
BEFORE THE VEHICLES ARE SOLD TO

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:46.926
THE PUBLIC.

01:52:46.993 --> 01:52:49.262
AND.

01:52:49.329 --> 01:52:50.597
REQUIRING THE AV'S PASS A

01:52:50.663 --> 01:52:52.398
DRIVER'S TEST

01:52:52.465 --> 01:52:54.434
SHOWING THAT THEY CAN SEE.

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:56.903
OBJECTS IN THE ROAD BEFORE THEM.

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:58.972
INCLUDING STATIONARY OBJECTS OR

01:52:59.038 --> 01:53:01.241
OBJECTS THAT ARE MOVING AND

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:02.242
APPARENTLY THERE ARE SOME

01:53:02.308 --> 01:53:03.910
VEHICLES THAT ARE BETTER AT THAT

01:53:03.977 --> 01:53:05.645
THAN OTHERS. THEY'RE CURRENTLY

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:08.748
BEING SOLD AND PROHIBIT.

01:53:08.815 --> 01:53:10.183
SALES OF LEVEL THREE AND FOUR

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:12.051
VEHICLES.

01:53:12.118 --> 01:53:13.052
AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:15.421
MANUFACTURERS WHO DIFFER IN

01:53:15.488 --> 01:53:16.723
THEIR OPINION OF WHETHER THAT'S

01:53:16.789 --> 01:53:18.158
A GOOD IDEA.

01:53:18.224 --> 01:53:20.193
BUT SOME MANUFACTURERS I THINK

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:23.029
WOULD AGREE WITH US THAT.

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:24.831
NOT SAFE TO RELY ON HUMAN

01:53:24.898 --> 01:53:26.166
DRIVERS NOT TO BECOME DISTRACTED

01:53:26.232 --> 01:53:27.901
AND.

01:53:27.967 --> 01:53:29.736
TO RELY ON THEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:53:29.802 --> 01:53:31.337
TAKE THE WHEEL A MOMENT'S NOTICE

01:53:31.404 --> 01:53:33.373
AND KNOW WHAT TO DO.

01:53:33.439 --> 01:53:35.808
EMERGENCY SITUATION.

01:53:35.875 --> 01:53:37.677
AND ESPECIALLY AS THE VEHICLES

01:53:37.744 --> 01:53:39.412
BECOME MORE COMMON YOU'RE

01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:41.047
DRIVING IS A SKILL TAKES A LOT

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:42.649
OF EXPERIENCE TO BECOME A REALLY

01:53:42.715 --> 01:53:44.751
GOOD DRIVER. SO WE ARE CONCERNED

01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:48.054
TOO ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN.

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:49.389
PEOPLE LOSE THAT SKILL AND

01:53:49.455 --> 01:53:50.924
HAVING DEVELOPED IT ARE THEY

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.724
GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER

01:53:51.791 --> 01:53:54.027
CONTROL.

01:53:54.093 --> 01:53:55.328
I'M MANDATE FULL PUBLIC

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:56.829
DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING OF

01:53:56.896 --> 01:53:58.364
CRASHES INVOLVING AUTONOMOUS

01:53:58.431 --> 01:53:59.966
VEHICLES.

01:54:00.033 --> 01:54:02.168
NOT ALLOWING MANUFACTURERS OF

01:54:02.235 --> 01:54:04.270
THEIR VEHICLES TO HIDE BEHIND

01:54:04.337 --> 01:54:05.939
LIKE FORCED ARBITRATION WHICH IS

01:54:06.005 --> 01:54:07.006
A CLOSED FORM.

01:54:07.073 --> 01:54:08.808
IN SECRET.

01:54:08.875 --> 01:54:10.476
AND ESTABLISH REASONABLE

01:54:10.543 --> 01:54:11.844
STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL

01:54:11.911 --> 01:54:14.814
STABILITY AND INSURANCE THE

01:54:14.881 --> 01:54:15.782
THRESHOLD IN.

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:18.651
SENATOR PADILLA'S PHIL WAS FIVE

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:20.019
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:54:20.086 --> 01:54:21.988
I'M.

01:54:22.055 --> 01:54:23.656
NOT SURE BUT I HAVE THE

01:54:23.723 --> 01:54:25.258
IMPRESSION THAT THAT WAS. WHAT

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:27.193
WAS IN MY JUST FOR THE TESTING

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.229
PHASE? SO FOR GOING TO ALLOW THE

01:54:29.295 --> 01:54:31.197
VEHICLES TO BE SOLD IN LARGE

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:34.634
VOLUMES WE WANT TO HAVE ENTITIES

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:35.568
THAT ARE FAR MORE SOLVENT THAN

01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:38.905
THAT. IN ONE LIFETIME EXPENSE

01:54:38.972 --> 01:54:40.406
FOR HEAD INJURED TEENAGER COST

01:54:40.473 --> 01:54:42.008
MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND FIVE

01:54:42.075 --> 01:54:44.377
MILLION DOLLARS SO WE DON'T WANT

01:54:44.444 --> 01:54:46.980
TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE.

01:54:47.046 --> 01:54:47.981
MORE.

01:54:48.047 --> 01:54:49.949
FLY BY NIGHT.

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:51.584
ENTITIES ARE ENTERING INTO THIS

01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:53.653
SPACE AND OFFERING PRODUCTS AND

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.888
THEN WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM NOT

01:54:55.955 --> 01:54:59.158
BE ABLE TO STAND BEHIND THEM.

01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:00.860
AND ALSO PROHIBIT MISLEADING

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:03.062
TERMINOLOGY IN FALSE ADVERTISING

01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:04.364
REGARDING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:05.965
IT'S

01:55:06.032 --> 01:55:08.268
WE BELIEVE IT'S MISLEADING

01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:10.603
SOMETIMES IF. PEOPLE. ARE HYPED

01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:12.705
BY THE TERMINOLOGY AND THEY

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:13.539
DON'T HAVE REASONABLE

01:55:13.606 --> 01:55:15.208
EXPECTATIONS.

01:55:15.275 --> 01:55:17.610
AND ALSO TO PROVIDE EDUCATION

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:19.612
MULTIPLE LANGUAGES.

01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:20.880
NO LOT OF TIMES THE OWNERS

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:23.316
MANUALS ARE ONLY IN ENGLISH.

01:55:23.383 --> 01:55:24.684
IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

01:55:24.751 --> 01:55:27.320
UNDERSTAND. HOW?

01:55:27.387 --> 01:55:28.855
WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM WHAT

01:55:28.921 --> 01:55:30.523
THEY CAN EXPECT TO THE VEHICLE

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:32.225
IN ORDER FOR TO OPERATE SAFELY

01:55:32.292 --> 01:55:33.760
YOU HAVE TO THINK WE? HAVE A

01:55:33.826 --> 01:55:35.528
VERY DIVERSE POPULATION OUR

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:36.663
STATE AND WE WANT ALL OF THEM TO

01:55:36.729 --> 01:55:38.798
BE SAFE.

01:55:38.865 --> 01:55:40.833
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:41.067
SO VERY.

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:43.603
.

01:55:43.670 --> 01:55:45.738
LOT OF GOOD POINTS.

01:55:45.805 --> 01:55:47.707
MULTIPLICITY OPEN APPRECIATE THE.

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:50.443
.

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:51.277
THE THOUGHTFULNESS ABOUT WHAT IS

01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:52.378
THE BAR.

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:54.380
SAFETY IN.

01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:56.115
I THINK MISTER BERMAN HAD A.

01:55:56.182 --> 01:55:58.551
A GREAT.

01:55:58.618 --> 01:55:59.919
STATEMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW THIRTY

01:55:59.986 --> 01:56:01.387
SEVEN THOUSAND.

01:56:01.454 --> 01:56:03.389
AND WE KNOW THE POTENTIAL OF.

01:56:03.456 --> 01:56:05.625
.

01:56:05.692 --> 01:56:08.227
SAVING LIVES CAN BE HUGE.

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:10.430
.

01:56:10.496 --> 01:56:11.597
SO DO THE TEAMSTERS HAVE

01:56:11.664 --> 01:56:12.899
CONCERNS ABOUT LEVELS OF

01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:14.600
AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY.

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:15.968
THAT WOULD REQUIRE DRIVER TO

01:56:16.035 --> 01:56:17.103
TAKE OVER THE WHEEL UNDER

01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:22.141
CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

01:56:22.208 --> 01:56:24.510
WE DON'T.

01:56:24.577 --> 01:56:26.879
WITH NO BASICALLY WE DON'T HAVE

01:56:26.946 --> 01:56:28.815
A PROBLEM WITH THAT ALTHOUGH.

01:56:28.881 --> 01:56:30.683
NONE.

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:31.584
I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:33.119
EXPERIENCE OF OUR MEMBERS WHO

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:35.955
OPERATE LOCOMOTIVES.

01:56:36.022 --> 01:56:37.890
WHERE YOU GO LONG STRETCHES OF

01:56:37.957 --> 01:56:39.692
TIME?

01:56:39.759 --> 01:56:42.128
IN WHICH.

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:42.862
THE TRAIN IS KIND OF RUNNING

01:56:42.929 --> 01:56:44.297
ITSELF

01:56:44.364 --> 01:56:45.598
AND THEN SOMETHING VERY JARRING

01:56:45.665 --> 01:56:47.433
CAN HAPPEN.

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:49.369
LIKE A KID CAN RIDE UP ON A BIKE

01:56:49.435 --> 01:56:50.737
TOWARDS OF WRITTEN A CROSSING

01:56:50.803 --> 01:56:51.904
WAS SOMETHING SUDDENLY CAN

01:56:51.971 --> 01:56:53.339
HAPPEN.

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:55.708
AND THEY DO REPORT THAT IN THOSE

01:56:55.775 --> 01:56:57.710
SITUATIONS IT'S A GOOD THING

01:56:57.777 --> 01:56:59.879
THERE'S A SECOND PERSON IN THAT

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:01.814
LOCOMOTIVE WITH AND THERE'S TWO

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:03.683
IN A FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVE BECAUSE.

01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:05.651
IT KEEPS YOU AWAKE AND ALERT AND

01:57:05.718 --> 01:57:07.153
WHEN YOU'RE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:08.521
ANOTHER PERSON SO YOU CAN STAY

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:09.956
AT THOSE CONTROLS. SO THERE ARE

01:57:10.022 --> 01:57:11.591
ISSUES.

01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:13.359
WHEN THERE'S IN ACTIVITY

01:57:13.426 --> 01:57:14.894
FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME THAT

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:16.396
PEOPLE'S MINDS BEGIN TO WANDER

01:57:16.462 --> 01:57:18.631
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRAIN

01:57:18.698 --> 01:57:20.366
DRIVERS HOW TO OPERATE.

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:22.869
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:57:22.935 --> 01:57:24.170
ON I JUST WANNA MAKE SOMETHING

01:57:24.237 --> 01:57:26.139
VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO

01:57:26.205 --> 01:57:27.874
QUESTION THAT.

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:29.642
FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:32.044
SOME POINT COULD SAVE LIVES

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:34.714
THE POINT I WAS MAKING IS NOT.

01:57:34.781 --> 01:57:36.649
THAT THERE CAN NEVER BE A DEATH

01:57:36.716 --> 01:57:38.451
BUT WHAT IS THE STANDARD

01:57:38.518 --> 01:57:39.919
IT'S THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:57:39.986 --> 01:57:41.421
PEOPLE ARE KILLED. ARE THEY

01:57:41.487 --> 01:57:43.890
WORKING IF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:57:43.956 --> 01:57:45.825
PEOPLE GET KILLED. EVERY YEAR

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:48.528
PROBABLY NOT ARE THEY WORKING IF

01:57:48.594 --> 01:57:50.129
TWENTY PEOPLE GET KILLED EVERY

01:57:50.196 --> 01:57:52.398
YEAR PROBABLY I MEAN ANOTHER

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:53.366
WORDS I'M JUST SAYING YOU HAVE

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:55.835
TO HAVE A STANDARD OF WHAT.

01:57:55.902 --> 01:57:59.372
MEETS THE LEVEL OF SAFETY THAT.

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:00.840
SAFETY EXPERTS THINK IS

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:03.309
REASONABLE. TO REQUIRE NOT.

01:58:03.376 --> 01:58:05.178
THAT.

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:07.180
THERE'S PERFECTION ALTHOUGH IT

01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:08.714
SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THEY'RE

01:58:08.781 --> 01:58:10.149
FULLY AUTONOMOUS THAT THE HOPE

01:58:10.216 --> 01:58:10.783
WOULD BE.

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:12.552
THAT.

01:58:12.618 --> 01:58:15.455
IT THERE WOULD BE.

01:58:15.521 --> 01:58:17.924
VERY VERY FEW INJURIES AND

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:19.826
DEATHS ON THE HIGHWAY WHICH

01:58:19.892 --> 01:58:21.794
WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS BENEFIT TO

01:58:21.861 --> 01:58:23.563
SOCIETY SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE.

01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:26.165
THAT'S MY ONLY POINT ABOUT THAT.

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:28.935
YEAH I KNOW THAT. THEY'D THROUGH

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:30.269
CALTRANS ANOTHER DEPARTMENTS

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:31.871
TREND TRANSPORTATION.

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:33.206
IT'S CALLED DEATH BY MILE COMEY

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:35.408
DESPERATE MILE WAS IN A CERTAIN.

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:38.411
AREA BEFORE THEY RESPOND HARM TO

01:58:38.478 --> 01:58:40.179
MAKE SAFETY CONCERNS IN ON

01:58:40.246 --> 01:58:42.482
ROADWAYS SO AGAIN THAT'S

01:58:42.548 --> 01:58:43.983
SOMETHING THAT THE. THE PEOPLE

01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:46.552
HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO YOU

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:48.654
KNOW ESTABLISH.

01:58:48.721 --> 01:58:50.656
AGAIN. POINT WELL TAKEN.

01:58:50.723 --> 01:58:52.592
AND THE I THINK THAT.

01:58:52.658 --> 01:58:54.227
AS YOU HAD MENTIONED.

01:58:54.293 --> 01:58:56.128
THAT FOR EVERY.

01:58:56.195 --> 01:58:57.630

02:17:00.545 --> 02:17:02.180
THE AGENCY ADVISE COMPANIES TO

02:17:02.247 --> 02:17:03.481
CONSIDER. WHEN DEVELOPING

02:17:03.548 --> 02:17:05.617
AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGIES.

02:17:05.684 --> 02:17:06.418
I THINK.

02:17:06.484 --> 02:17:08.420
AS AS WAY MODE DID WE.

02:17:08.486 --> 02:17:11.022
DISTRIBUTED A COPY OF THE GM

02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:11.790
REPORT I THINK.

02:17:11.856 --> 02:17:14.859
WE IN. GM AND WAY MORE THE ONLY

02:17:14.926 --> 02:17:15.927
TWO OF UP PUT THAT OUT SO FAR.

02:17:15.994 --> 02:17:19.164
THE REPORT.

02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:20.031
GM IS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:17:20.098 --> 02:17:21.333
ENVIRONMENT

02:17:21.399 --> 02:17:22.467
IT'S PART OF OUR VISION FOR THE

02:17:22.534 --> 02:17:23.868
FUTURE WE BELIEVE THAT ALL SELF

02:17:23.935 --> 02:17:24.603
DRIVING VEHICLES SHOULD BE

02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:26.004
ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:27.772
IN FACT.

02:17:27.839 --> 02:17:29.708
GM PLANS TO INTRODUCE TWENTY NEW

02:17:29.774 --> 02:17:30.742
ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY TWENTY

02:17:30.809 --> 02:17:32.644
TWENTY THREE.

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:34.279
SELF DRIVING VEHICLES ARE A GOOD

02:17:34.346 --> 02:17:35.380
WAY TO DEPLOY ELECTRIFICATION AT

02:17:35.447 --> 02:17:36.581
SCALE.

02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:38.116
OUR SELF DRIVING VEHICLES TODAY

02:17:38.183 --> 02:17:39.651
ARE BUILT ON THE BOLT EVEY

02:17:39.718 --> 02:17:41.319

ON A SINGLE CHARGE.

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:47.225
THE BOLT HAS NO TAILPIPE

02:17:47.292 --> 02:17:48.193
EMISSIONS WHICH ADVANCES OUR

02:17:48.259 --> 02:17:50.629
GOAL OF ZERO EMISSIONS.

02:17:50.695 --> 02:17:51.997
WE BELIEVE THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:17:52.063 --> 02:17:52.831
TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE THE

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:54.299

WORLD ZERO CRASHES ZERO

02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:00.005
EMISSIONS IN ZERO CONGESTION

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:03.008
THAT WE SEEK.

02:18:03.074 --> 02:18:04.576
SPEAKING OF CONGESTION.

02:18:04.643 --> 02:18:06.011
IT'S AN INCREASING CONCERN

02:18:06.077 --> 02:18:08.513
ESPECIALLY IN THE URBAN CENTERS.

02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:10.181

ABILITIES IN ADDRESSING THEM

02:22:23.434 --> 02:22:24.969
WERE PART OF THE OUT OF ICE ACT.

02:22:25.036 --> 02:22:25.870
IN AND.

02:22:25.937 --> 02:22:27.605
AND THERE'S A PROCESS BY

02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:29.107
SHARING INFORMATION THAT. ON A

02:22:29.173 --> 02:22:31.342

CYBER THAT THIS IS ACTION ISSUE

02:22:42.553 --> 02:22:43.688
THAT THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY

02:22:43.755 --> 02:22:44.789
MORE GENERALLY HAS TO GRAPPLE

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:46.524
WITH THAT AND EXPENSE TO

02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:48.426
CONNECTED CARS AS WELL AND SO. I

02:22:48.493 --> 02:22:50.495
THINK ADAM. WHAT OUR APPROACH TO

02:22:50.561 --> 02:22:51.629
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IS IT IT

02:22:51.696 --> 02:22:53.264
NEED NOT BE SORT OF CONNECTED

02:22:53.331 --> 02:22:55.600
INTO THIS THE ITS SYSTEM?

02:22:55.667 --> 02:22:56.534
AND SO.

02:22:56.601 --> 02:22:58.202
ROUTE REDUCING THE THE THREAT

02:22:58.269 --> 02:22:59.904
FACTORS I AS PART OF OUR THING

02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:01.806
UP BUILDING AT AND THEN ON

02:23:01.873 --> 02:23:02.073
PRIVACY.

02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:04.809
I THINK WE HAVE EXPERIENCE

02:23:04.876 --> 02:23:05.543
THINKING ABOUT.

02:23:05.610 --> 02:23:07.478
CONSUMER PRIVACY ISSUES GIVEN

02:23:07.545 --> 02:23:09.414
THAT WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING A

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:09.681
FLEET OF.

02:23:09.747 --> 02:23:10.315
.

02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:11.516
HAVING THESE RIGHTS ARE

02:23:11.582 --> 02:23:12.850
PASSENGERS FOR MANY YEARS.

02:23:12.917 --> 02:23:15.320
SO WE THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:16.354
THEIR PRIVACY AND WE WE HAVE A

02:23:16.421 --> 02:23:17.555
PRIVACY.

02:23:17.622 --> 02:23:19.524
DESIGN TEAM WHO IS THINKING

02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:21.793
ABOUT HOW TO MAXIMIZE ALL OF

02:23:21.859 --> 02:23:24.128
THIS IN IN THE AV WORLD AND WILL

02:23:24.195 --> 02:23:24.762
BE HAVING MORE SENSORS ON THE.

02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:30.501
VEHICLE.

02:23:30.568 --> 02:23:31.803
I WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE THING IT

02:23:31.869 --> 02:23:33.638
DID THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE

02:23:33.705 --> 02:23:35.707
WITNESSES SEEM TO.

02:23:35.773 --> 02:23:38.443
PROCEED FROM THE PREMISE THAT.

02:23:38.509 --> 02:23:39.544
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES MUST BE

02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:41.980
PERFECT OR NEAR PERFECT.

02:23:42.046 --> 02:23:44.482
AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THESE

02:23:44.549 --> 02:23:45.316
VEHICLES OF THE STANDARD SHOULD

02:23:45.383 --> 02:23:47.385
BE. DO THESE VEHICLE SAVE A

02:23:47.452 --> 02:23:49.287
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LIVES.

02:23:49.354 --> 02:23:51.089
BECAUSE WE WE ARE LOSING THIRTY

02:23:51.155 --> 02:23:52.590
SEVEN THOUSAND WATER SIXTY ONE

02:23:52.657 --> 02:23:53.224
LIVES.

02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:54.258
TWO YEARS AGO WAS MOST RECENT

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:55.593
STATS.

02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:57.929
AND THE QUESTION SHOULDN'T BE

02:23:57.996 --> 02:23:58.796
OUR IS IT BECAUSE IT.

02:23:58.863 --> 02:24:00.431
.

02:24:00.498 --> 02:24:02.233
STOPPING YOUR IN EVERY SINGLE

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:03.935
SITUATION ARE ARE THEY NOT

02:24:04.002 --> 02:24:05.603
CRASHING OR IN EVERY SINGLE

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:07.872
SITUATION DO THEY PREVENT. A

02:24:07.939 --> 02:24:10.074
CRASH FOR ONE THING IT WILL BE

02:24:10.141 --> 02:24:11.643
THIRTY YEARS BEFORE. AUTONOMOUS

02:24:11.709 --> 02:24:13.845
VEHICLES ARE THE ENTIRE CAR

02:24:13.911 --> 02:24:15.847
PARKED ON THE ROAD. I FOR A LONG

02:24:15.913 --> 02:24:17.749
TIME THEY WILL BE SHARING THE

02:24:17.815 --> 02:24:18.049
ROAD WITH.

02:24:18.116 --> 02:24:19.784
HUMAN DRIVERS AND MAYBE LONGER

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:21.152
THAN THIRTY YEARS.

02:24:21.219 --> 02:24:22.387
BUT AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS SO SO

02:24:22.453 --> 02:24:23.554
I THINK THAT THAT'S IT'S IT'S

02:24:23.621 --> 02:24:25.456
IT'S SORT OF A.

02:24:25.523 --> 02:24:27.258
IN MY VIEW AND GM'S VIEW OF

02:24:27.325 --> 02:24:28.826
MISTAKEN FRAMING OF THE ISSUE.

02:24:28.893 --> 02:24:30.261
IT SHOULDN'T BE HOW CLOSE TO

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:33.598
PERFECTION ARE WE IT SHOULD BE.

02:24:33.664 --> 02:24:35.366
ARE ARE WE SAVING A SIGNIFICANT

02:24:35.433 --> 02:24:37.268
NUMBER OF HUMAN LIVES

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:38.936
ANOTHER THING ON ON CYBER.

02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:40.538
THAT WHEN THE PEOPLE TIME

02:24:40.605 --> 02:24:42.006
OUTSIDE WHAT WE DID AT OUR

02:24:42.073 --> 02:24:43.641
SUBSIDIARY CREWS AUTOMATION IS

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:44.675
WE WENT OUT AND HIRED THE TO

02:24:44.742 --> 02:24:46.144
DEEP PACKERS.

02:24:46.210 --> 02:24:47.945
AND WE HAVE THEM DOT DOINGS ARE

02:24:48.012 --> 02:24:50.381
RED TEAM EVALUATION OF OUR.

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:51.883
OUR TECHNOLOGY.

02:24:51.949 --> 02:24:53.618
ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

02:24:53.684 --> 02:24:54.652
IT IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY HE'S

02:24:54.719 --> 02:24:56.454
SABERS IS A BIG CHALLENGE AND I

02:24:56.521 --> 02:24:58.022
THINK MOST COMPANIES MOST AUTO

02:24:58.089 --> 02:24:59.524
COMPANIES AND MY FELLOW

02:24:59.590 --> 02:25:00.958
PANELISTS OF THEIR COMPANIES ARE

02:25:01.025 --> 02:25:02.326
VERY AWARE OF IT AND WORKING

02:25:02.393 --> 02:25:03.594
HARD ON IT BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S

02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:04.729
SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BE.

02:25:04.796 --> 02:25:05.596
FOREVER VIGILANT ON.

02:25:06.964 --> 02:25:09.167
SO IT AND AND THEN I THINK THAT

02:25:09.233 --> 02:25:10.034
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:11.769
MENTION. WAS.

02:25:11.836 --> 02:25:12.904
THE INSURANCE IN THIS IS THIS IS

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:16.207
A WHOLE KIND OF.

02:25:16.274 --> 02:25:20.611
SERIES OF CONSOLATION ISSUES BUT.

02:25:20.678 --> 02:25:22.513
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE IN

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:24.449
GENERAL ARE OUR ECONOMIC ACT

02:25:24.515 --> 02:25:26.417
LIKE ANYBODY ELSE AND THAT THEY

02:25:26.484 --> 02:25:28.186
SHOULDN'T BE ENTITLED TO PRIVATE

02:25:28.252 --> 02:25:29.687
INFORMATION ANY MORE THAN ANYONE

02:25:29.754 --> 02:25:31.756
ELSE IS MEAN THAT'S NOT HOW THEY

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:32.857
DO IT NOW AND IF THEY WANT TO

02:25:32.924 --> 02:25:34.525
ENGAGE IN THAT. INSURANCE

02:25:34.592 --> 02:25:36.260
TRANSACTION WITH WITH AN AUTO

02:25:36.327 --> 02:25:37.528
COMPANY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:25:37.595 --> 02:25:39.097
THEY CAN ASK THE COMPANY IF

02:25:39.163 --> 02:25:40.064
THEY CAN HAVE DATA AND THE

02:25:40.131 --> 02:25:41.766
COMPANY CAN CHOOSE TO PROVIDE IT

02:25:41.833 --> 02:25:42.767
OR NOT.

02:25:42.834 --> 02:25:44.268
BUT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

02:25:44.335 --> 02:25:45.369
THERE SHOULD BE ANY SORT OF.

02:25:45.436 --> 02:25:47.572
.

02:25:47.638 --> 02:25:48.773
PRESUMPTION THAT THEY'RE

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:51.442
ENTITLED TO. ADDITIONAL DATA.

02:25:51.509 --> 02:25:52.743
MERELY BECAUSE OF THEIR

02:25:52.810 --> 02:25:54.178
INSURERS.

02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:03.020
MACRO COMMENTS I'VE IT WE'VE GOT

02:26:03.087 --> 02:26:04.489
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

MAY I I THINK I SAID I CAN

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:07.892
RIVERS ON THE COLLEGES HAD HER.

02:26:07.959 --> 02:26:09.527
BEFORE I LEFT HERE YOU KNOW THAT

02:26:09.594 --> 02:26:10.661
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO

02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:12.530
BE READY BEFORE SOCIETY IS.

02:26:12.597 --> 02:26:16.134
I FOR ONE AM A BIG BELIEVER IN

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:17.268
THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIST

02:26:17.335 --> 02:26:19.070
TECHNOLOGY WHETHER IT'S THE

02:26:19.137 --> 02:26:20.571
SAFETY COMPONENT WHETHER IT'S

02:26:20.638 --> 02:26:22.607
HOW WE TOTALLY. CHANGE.

02:26:22.673 --> 02:26:24.308
ARE BUILT LANDSCAPE OF OF

02:26:24.375 --> 02:26:26.611
CITIES AND AND HOW MOBILITY AND

02:26:26.677 --> 02:26:28.212
HOW WE GET AROUND ALISON YOU CAN

02:26:28.279 --> 02:26:29.614
YOU CAN.

02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:31.048
THAT LEAST SO I POSITED FOUR

02:26:31.115 --> 02:26:32.216
YEARS AGO IN THIS TEXT TALK

02:26:32.283 --> 02:26:34.285
TURNED. PARKING GARAGES AND.

02:26:34.352 --> 02:26:36.087
INTO AN APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE

02:26:36.154 --> 02:26:37.889
PARKS OR OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE

02:26:37.955 --> 02:26:39.824
A MASSIVE IMPACT BUT IT'S

02:26:39.891 --> 02:26:40.625
COMPLICATED.

02:26:40.691 --> 02:26:41.659
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:26:41.726 --> 02:26:43.094
DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS THAT

02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:44.228
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HAVE WITH

02:26:44.295 --> 02:26:46.430
EVERYBODY WHO SPOKEN TODAY.

02:26:46.497 --> 02:26:49.066
AND AND YEAH I'M THAT'S OUR JOB

02:26:49.133 --> 02:26:50.902
TO BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND

02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:51.402
AND HASH OUT THOSE HARD

02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:52.770
CONVERSATIONS.

02:26:52.837 --> 02:26:54.505
AND HOPEFULLY PUT FORTH A

02:26:54.572 --> 02:26:56.007
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT.

02:26:56.073 --> 02:26:58.209
BOTH PROMOTES.

02:26:58.276 --> 02:26:59.877
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION AND

02:26:59.944 --> 02:27:01.579
BUT IS ALSO SAFE.

02:27:01.646 --> 02:27:04.015
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S

02:27:04.081 --> 02:27:04.815
THE DIFFICULT BALANCE THAT WILL

02:27:04.882 --> 02:27:06.417
HAVE MOVING FORWARD BUT

02:27:06.484 --> 02:27:07.618
APPRECIATE ALL AND EVERYONE

02:27:07.685 --> 02:27:10.454
ELSE'S COME TO SPEAK TODAY. ON

02:27:10.521 --> 02:27:11.055
LOOKING FOR MORE CONVERSATIONS

02:27:11.122 --> 02:27:13.424
ABOUT IT.

02:27:13.491 --> 02:27:16.027
THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN SO.

02:27:16.093 --> 02:27:17.595
THIS IS KIND OF A GENERAL FOR

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:18.196
ALL OF YOU QUESTION FOR ALL OF

02:27:18.262 --> 02:27:19.530
YOU.

02:27:19.597 --> 02:27:20.565
SO WHAT IF ANY.

02:27:20.631 --> 02:27:23.768
INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES DO WE.

02:27:23.834 --> 02:27:25.469
AS CAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:27:25.536 --> 02:27:27.305
WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT WE MAKE

02:27:27.371 --> 02:27:28.306
IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE. OF

02:27:28.372 --> 02:27:31.242
AUTOMATED VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.

02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:32.310
A WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:27:32.376 --> 02:27:34.812
DIFFERENCES OF.

02:27:34.879 --> 02:27:36.948
URBAN RURAL. AND.

02:27:37.014 --> 02:27:39.784
ESERVER SUGGESTED.

02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:41.319
MODIFICATIONS THAT WE COULD BE

02:27:41.385 --> 02:27:43.521
MAKING TO CALTRANS

02:27:43.588 --> 02:27:48.793
TO. MAKE THIS INTEGRATION BETTER.

02:27:48.859 --> 02:27:49.961
I WAS LAST NIGHT OF THE FIRST

02:27:50.027 --> 02:27:50.561
TIMES OF THE FIRST THIS TIME.

02:27:50.628 --> 02:27:52.129
.

02:27:52.196 --> 02:27:54.031
I THINK THAT FOR THE MOST PART A

02:27:54.098 --> 02:27:55.132
LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:27:55.199 --> 02:27:57.435
CHANGES THAT CITIES THINK ABOUT.

02:27:57.501 --> 02:27:59.804
ARE FOR VEHICLE TO VEHICLE.

02:27:59.870 --> 02:28:01.339
YOU KNOW IT OR VEHICLE

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:02.773
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT KIND OF

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.508
RADIO WAVE COMMUNICATION.

02:28:04.575 --> 02:28:06.777
FOR OUR VEHICLE WE WE DON'T USE

02:28:06.844 --> 02:28:08.045
THAT KIND OF COMMUNICATION SO WE

02:28:08.112 --> 02:28:09.914
WOULDN'T NEED THAT.

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:12.583
WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IS

02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:12.783
MORE?

02:28:12.850 --> 02:28:14.552
?

02:28:14.619 --> 02:28:17.188
ELECTRICAL. INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:28:17.255 --> 02:28:19.156
AND THAT'S THAT INVOLVES A LOT

02:28:19.223 --> 02:28:20.791
OF DIFFERENT PLAYERS AND A LOT

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:21.392
OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND SO

02:28:21.459 --> 02:28:22.660
FORTH AND SO IT'S. IT'S

02:28:22.727 --> 02:28:24.228
SOMETHING THAT IT'S VALUABLE IN

02:28:24.295 --> 02:28:25.596
AND WORTH WHILE TO START

02:28:25.663 --> 02:28:26.831
THINKING ABOUT TALKING ABOUT

02:28:26.897 --> 02:28:28.399
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BECAUSE

02:28:28.466 --> 02:28:30.067
I THINK THAT THAT.

02:28:30.134 --> 02:28:31.469
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU WANT

02:28:31.535 --> 02:28:32.570
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON A

02:28:32.637 --> 02:28:34.138
CALIFORNIA IS IS HAS.

02:28:34.205 --> 02:28:35.172
A POLICY OF ENCOURAGING ELECTRIC

02:28:35.239 --> 02:28:36.574
VEHICLES.

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:38.809
YOU'VE GOT HAVE CHARGES FOR

02:28:38.876 --> 02:28:39.443
THEM TO.

02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:41.145
FOR THEM TO BE A VIABLE METHOD

02:28:41.212 --> 02:28:43.481
OF OF MOST PEOPLE GETTING AROUND

02:28:43.547 --> 02:28:44.048
SO THAT THAT'S WHAT I WOULD

02:28:44.115 --> 02:28:45.883
SUGGEST.

02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:47.618
THE OTHERS.

02:28:47.685 --> 02:28:48.986
I TO OTHERS THAT HAD.

02:28:49.053 --> 02:28:50.621
SORT OF.

02:28:50.688 --> 02:28:52.023
INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY MORE

02:28:52.089 --> 02:28:54.825
BROADLY I THINK IN IT'S CRITICAL

02:28:54.892 --> 02:28:57.194
TO INTEGRATE. INTO PUBLIC

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:59.430
TRANSIT AS WELL AS TO GENERAL.

02:28:59.497 --> 02:29:02.433
RIDESHARE TO START TO MAKE THE

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:03.834
SHIFT AWAY FROM PARKING SPOTS

02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:05.503
ENABLE MORE A PICK UP AND DROP

02:29:05.569 --> 02:29:06.971
OFF LOCATIONS.

02:29:07.038 --> 02:29:08.973
AND THAT SORT OF CAN.

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:10.374
YEAH I GO TO THE VISION A YOU

02:29:10.441 --> 02:29:11.742
DISCUSS THINGS I THINK THAT WILL

02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:13.277
TAKE A LOT OF WORK.

02:29:13.344 --> 02:29:15.112
AND WILL UNLOCK A LOT OF VALUE.

02:29:15.179 --> 02:29:17.081
A AND I THINK THE OTHER IS.

02:29:17.148 --> 02:29:19.216
AS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN PANELS

02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:21.652
THERE IS A RISK OF AS THE AV'S

02:29:21.719 --> 02:29:22.987
BECOME READILY MORE ACCESSIBLE

02:29:23.054 --> 02:29:23.754
WHICH IS GREAT TO INCREASE

02:29:23.821 --> 02:29:25.790
MOBILITY ACCESS THERE WILL BE. A

02:29:25.856 --> 02:29:27.825
HIGHER DEMAND AND SO THERE MAY

02:29:27.892 --> 02:29:29.493
RUN THE RISK OF CONGESTION SO

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:31.896
UNLOCKING THE ABILITY TO.

02:29:31.962 --> 02:29:33.130
USE.

02:29:33.197 --> 02:29:34.899
POLICIES SUCH AS CONGESTION

02:29:34.965 --> 02:29:36.600
PRICING OR ENCOURAGE HIGH

02:29:36.667 --> 02:29:37.868
OCCUPANCY VEHICLE LANES ARE

02:29:37.935 --> 02:29:39.503
OTHER WAYS TO ENCOURAGE AT THESE

02:29:39.570 --> 02:29:41.906
AV'S P. SHARED. A AND POOLS I

02:29:41.972 --> 02:29:43.407
THINK WOULD BE CRITICAL FOR

02:29:43.474 --> 02:29:46.544
THEIR SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT.

02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:48.145
WELL I I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD

02:29:48.212 --> 02:29:49.180
THAT THE THE PARKING ISSUE WHERE

02:29:49.246 --> 02:29:51.148
THE THE PICK UP POINT ISSUE AND

02:29:51.215 --> 02:29:52.483
DROP OFF POINT ISSUE FOR.

02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:53.984
FOR PASSENGERS IS A REALLY

02:29:54.051 --> 02:29:55.453
IMPORTANT ONE AND I THINK YOU

02:29:55.519 --> 02:29:56.620
KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING

02:29:56.687 --> 02:29:58.055
I'M SURE YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF US

02:29:58.122 --> 02:29:58.689
BUT WORKING WITH.

02:29:58.756 --> 02:30:00.658
IT'S THE CITIES AND LIKE IN THE

02:30:00.725 --> 02:30:02.259
SMALL AREAS AND.

02:30:02.326 --> 02:30:04.161
PHOENIX WERE ATTESTING TO AND

02:30:04.228 --> 02:30:05.629
THAT THE CITY SEEM TO BE VERY

02:30:05.696 --> 02:30:07.565
INTERESTED IN HELPING US FIND

02:30:07.631 --> 02:30:09.266
LOCATIONS ANYWHERE WHICH WE CAN.

02:30:09.333 --> 02:30:11.168
DO A SAFETY DROP OFF AND PICK

02:30:11.235 --> 02:30:12.136
UPS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH

02:30:12.203 --> 02:30:14.772
TRAFFIC SOME MORE EMPHASIS ON ON

02:30:14.839 --> 02:30:16.173
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT AYE

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:18.109
I THINK FIXING POTHOLES THIS IS

02:30:18.175 --> 02:30:20.010
GOOD FOR OUR CUSTOMER SITE MOVIE.

02:30:20.077 --> 02:30:21.712
BIG GRAVE WE CAN JUST FIX MORE

02:30:21.779 --> 02:30:23.280
THE BOTTLES I THINK.

02:30:23.347 --> 02:30:25.616
HAS BEEN HAS BE ONE ON YOUR ON

02:30:25.683 --> 02:30:27.485
YOUR SERVICE. IT AT YOUR SERVICE.

02:30:27.551 --> 02:30:29.553
NOW.

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:30.821
COMING NEAR YOU.

02:30:30.888 --> 02:30:32.656
NO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AND

02:30:32.723 --> 02:30:33.724
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY AND WHEN

02:30:33.791 --> 02:30:35.126
YOU MENTION THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:30:35.192 --> 02:30:38.863
GOING FORWARD SO ARE WE LIMITING.

02:30:38.929 --> 02:30:40.998
TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

02:30:41.065 --> 02:30:41.866
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS

02:30:41.932 --> 02:30:42.600
CONCENTRATION.

02:30:42.666 --> 02:30:44.502
ON.

02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:47.238
THIS VERY CONCENTRIC ISSUE AND

02:30:47.304 --> 02:30:48.572
SO DO I HAVE TO BUY A SEPARATE

02:30:48.639 --> 02:30:50.107
CAR.

02:30:50.174 --> 02:30:51.942
TO GO OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WANT

02:30:52.009 --> 02:30:53.677
TO GO TO TEXAS

02:30:53.744 --> 02:30:55.112
OR IF I WANNA GO TO WYOMING

02:30:55.179 --> 02:30:57.214
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MOVING IN

02:30:57.281 --> 02:30:59.583
THIS DIRECTION. AND SO SAY I I

02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:00.618
COMMIT TO.

02:31:00.684 --> 02:31:00.785
THE.

02:31:00.851 --> 02:31:02.620
.

02:31:02.686 --> 02:31:02.787
THE.

02:31:02.853 --> 02:31:05.289
THIS TECHNOLOGY.

02:31:05.356 --> 02:31:07.391
AND ALSO I GO TO THE BORDER AND

02:31:07.458 --> 02:31:08.592
I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY FOR

02:31:08.659 --> 02:31:10.594
INFASTRUCTURE.

02:31:10.661 --> 02:31:11.829
UP BECAUSE IT THERE'D NOT

02:31:11.896 --> 02:31:17.368
CONCENTRATING ON LIKE WE SHOULD.

02:31:17.435 --> 02:31:17.701
I THINK THAT.

02:31:17.768 --> 02:31:19.370
.

02:31:19.437 --> 02:31:20.938
ONE OF THINGS THAT RAISES IS

02:31:21.005 --> 02:31:22.173
QUESTION OF OF.

02:31:22.239 --> 02:31:24.675
UNIFORM FEDERAL POLICY VERSES A.

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:27.945
STATE BY STATE POLICY

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:28.879
AND.

02:31:28.946 --> 02:31:30.281
SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE WERE

02:31:30.347 --> 02:31:32.383
WERE ENCOURAGING YOU TO SOME OF

02:31:32.450 --> 02:31:33.584
THE EARLIER PANELS WE'RE

02:31:33.651 --> 02:31:34.652
ENCOURAGING YOU TO.

02:31:34.718 --> 02:31:36.253
AND ACT.

02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:39.356
LAWS GOVERNING THE PHYSICAL CAR.

02:31:39.423 --> 02:31:40.691
ARE AS A STATE AND A STATE BY

02:31:40.758 --> 02:31:42.226
STATE BASIS.

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:44.595
IF WE DO THAT I THINK WILL END

02:31:44.662 --> 02:31:45.863
UP WITH THE SCENARIO THAT YOU'RE

02:31:45.930 --> 02:31:47.731
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE NEVADA MAY

02:31:47.798 --> 02:31:48.866
HAVE A DIFFERENT ONE MAY HAVE A

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:50.334
DIFFERENT ONE FROM OREGON AND

02:31:50.401 --> 02:31:51.869
AND. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA THIRD

02:31:51.936 --> 02:31:53.270
AND SO FORTH.

02:31:53.337 --> 02:31:54.805
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE FEATURES OF

02:31:54.872 --> 02:31:56.307
THAT.

02:31:56.373 --> 02:31:57.475
THE LEGISLATION THE FEDERAL

02:31:57.541 --> 02:31:58.976
LEGISLATION IS THAT IT KEEPS IN

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:01.545
PLACE THE CURRENT ALLOCATION OF

02:32:01.612 --> 02:32:03.147
RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE

02:32:03.214 --> 02:32:03.781
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE

02:32:03.848 --> 02:32:04.849
GOVERNMENTS.

02:32:04.915 --> 02:32:06.350
AND IT IT THE THINGS THAT NEED

02:32:06.417 --> 02:32:08.319
TO BE UNIFORM.

02:32:08.385 --> 02:32:10.054
ARE THIS RESPONSIBILITY THE

02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:11.755
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT THE

02:32:11.822 --> 02:32:11.956
LOCAL.

02:32:12.022 --> 02:32:13.257
.

02:32:13.324 --> 02:32:14.592
MORE LOCAL AND STATE CONCERNS

02:32:14.658 --> 02:32:15.125
OUR RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:32:15.192 --> 02:32:16.494
STATE'S

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:18.462
SO SO THAT'S I I THINK IMPORTANT.

02:32:18.529 --> 02:32:22.333
POLICY CONSIDERATIONS.

02:32:22.399 --> 02:32:23.868
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT JUST

02:32:23.934 --> 02:32:24.969
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT.

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:27.104
YOU OVER FREIGHT.

02:32:27.171 --> 02:32:30.074
OH WE LOOK AT RIGHT NOW OF THE

02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:31.141
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT

02:32:31.208 --> 02:32:33.744
ARE ARE. CONSISTENTLY IMPACTED

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:36.213
BY THE DIESEL DISOWNS IN AND WE

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:39.717
LOOK FOR A AN ABILITY TO GO TO

02:32:39.783 --> 02:32:41.418
ELECTRIFICATION ON FREIGHT. ON

02:32:41.485 --> 02:32:41.886
VEHICLES.

02:32:41.952 --> 02:32:44.488
.

02:32:44.555 --> 02:32:46.690
UNLESSWE REDUCE THIS CONGESTION

02:32:46.757 --> 02:32:48.626
OUTSIDE OF OUR PORTS

02:32:48.692 --> 02:32:49.693
LET'S WE MAKE A CONCENTRATED

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:51.195
EFFORT.

02:32:51.262 --> 02:32:52.663
HAVE THINGS IT CAN BE THE BEST

02:32:52.730 --> 02:32:54.398
TECHNOLOGY BUT SITTING NOT

02:32:54.465 --> 02:32:56.600
MAKING ANY KIND OF.

02:32:56.667 --> 02:32:59.236
MONEY OR TURNS OR. IS JUST

02:32:59.303 --> 02:33:00.337
SITTING IS CONGESTION IN YOU'D

02:33:00.404 --> 02:33:02.072
MENTION ABOUT TO FROM MODES OF

02:33:02.139 --> 02:33:03.607
TRYING TO REDUCE.

02:33:03.674 --> 02:33:05.409
WE ALSO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:33:05.476 --> 02:33:07.845
CONTRAFLOW AND GETTING CAPACITY

02:33:07.912 --> 02:33:09.880
OF IN DIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC.

02:33:09.947 --> 02:33:11.682
A BIT.

02:33:11.749 --> 02:33:13.584
I WANTED WE TALK ABOUT

02:33:13.651 --> 02:33:15.553
INFRASTRUCTURE NEED.

02:33:15.619 --> 02:33:17.121
WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

02:33:17.187 --> 02:33:18.389
ABILITY TO REDUCE CONGESTION OUT

02:33:18.455 --> 02:33:20.958
OF OUR PORTS.

02:33:21.025 --> 02:33:23.260
TO BE ABLE TO TO INCENTIVIZE AN

02:33:23.327 --> 02:33:24.662
ECONOMY NUMBER ONE BECAUSE AGAIN

02:33:24.728 --> 02:33:26.764
IT'S A THIRD OF OUR ECONOMY. IN

02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:27.364
CALIFORNIA WE JUST MOVED UP TO

02:33:27.431 --> 02:33:28.499
THE.

02:33:28.566 --> 02:33:30.367
NUMBER FIVE IN THE WORLD.

02:33:30.434 --> 02:33:32.870
BUT I THINK WHAT WHEN YOU GUYS

02:33:32.937 --> 02:33:35.606
TALK ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO.

02:33:35.673 --> 02:33:37.474
BE PART OF THIS PROCESS I THINK

02:33:37.541 --> 02:33:38.776
IT'S A TWO WAY STREET WHEN YOU

02:33:38.842 --> 02:33:40.477
TALK ABOUT WANTING TO BE PART IN

02:33:40.544 --> 02:33:42.279
THE FREIGHT INDUSTRY. AND. IN

02:33:42.346 --> 02:33:43.948
THE TIMES WORLD.

02:33:44.014 --> 02:33:45.049
WE HAVE TO BECAUSE THE

02:33:45.115 --> 02:33:47.184
INTEGRATION WITH.

02:33:47.251 --> 02:33:48.552
NANA THOMAS AND THOMAS WE'RE

02:33:48.619 --> 02:33:50.054
GONNA HAVE.

02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:51.589
THE CONUNDRUM IF WE DON'T

02:33:51.655 --> 02:33:53.591
CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE

02:33:53.657 --> 02:33:56.093
REDUCTION OF CONGESTION AND

02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:57.795
IMPROVE THAT ECONOMY BECAUSE OUR

02:33:57.861 --> 02:33:59.730
FREIGHT IS GOING TO INCREASE

02:33:59.797 --> 02:34:01.432
DRAMATICALLY. IN THE NEXT THREE

02:34:01.498 --> 02:34:02.800
TO FIVE YEARS

02:34:02.866 --> 02:34:04.034
WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THAT

02:34:04.101 --> 02:34:05.102
INDUSTRY ANY REASON TO GO

02:34:05.169 --> 02:34:06.770
ELSEWHERE.

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:08.539
SO I THINK THAT.

02:34:08.606 --> 02:34:09.974
NOT ONLY IS THE STATE HAVE TO BE

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:11.742
A PART OF IT THE CALIFORNIA AIR

02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:12.910
RESOURCE BOARD HAS BEEN PART OF

02:34:12.977 --> 02:34:14.378
THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY ALSO HAS TO

02:34:14.445 --> 02:34:15.679
BE PART OF THAT. THREE LEGGED

02:34:15.746 --> 02:34:17.381
STOOL.

02:34:17.448 --> 02:34:19.984
CREATE AND SUPPORTER ECONOMY.

02:34:20.050 --> 02:34:21.118
NOT ONLY TO ADVANCE IN

02:34:21.185 --> 02:34:23.487
TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO REDUCTION OF

02:34:23.554 --> 02:34:26.090
GHGS PARTICULATES.

02:34:26.156 --> 02:34:27.992
BUT IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF

02:34:28.058 --> 02:34:30.995
ECONOMY PEOPLE MAKING. A LIVING.

02:34:31.061 --> 02:34:32.696
AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING

02:34:32.763 --> 02:34:34.231
YOU AND YOUR INDUSTRY BEING PART

02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:35.165
OF THAT.

02:34:35.232 --> 02:34:37.201
THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD.

02:34:37.267 --> 02:34:38.736
I THINK IT HAS COMMENTS AND I

02:34:38.802 --> 02:34:39.970
VERY MUCH AGREE I THINK THE A

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:41.538
THREE LEGGED STOOL APPROACHES

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:42.306
CRITICAL.

02:34:42.373 --> 02:34:43.774
WE WOULD BE EAGER TO CONTINUE

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:45.275
IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THEN

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:46.477
LOOKING AT BACK TO

02:34:46.543 --> 02:34:48.178
INFRASTRUCTURE GHG. AYE IF WE

02:34:48.245 --> 02:34:50.047
THINK ABOUT SORT OF WHAT THE

02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:52.182
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE I WILL MEAN

02:34:52.249 --> 02:34:53.183
FOR THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IT

02:34:53.250 --> 02:34:55.219
WILL ALLOW LONG HAUL TRUCKING.

02:34:55.285 --> 02:34:57.221
WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES BUT

02:34:57.287 --> 02:34:57.421
THEN.

02:34:57.488 --> 02:34:58.489
THAT WILL.

02:34:58.555 --> 02:34:59.957
WHAT WE'RE CALLING CREATE A LOT

02:35:00.024 --> 02:35:01.892
OF TRANSFER HUBS WHICH WILL BE A

02:35:01.959 --> 02:35:02.860
LOT OF SHORT STOPS

02:35:02.926 --> 02:35:04.328
AND THAT WILL BE DRIVEN BY HUMAN

02:35:04.395 --> 02:35:06.230
DRIVERS BUT ONE ADVANTAGE OF

02:35:06.296 --> 02:35:06.830
THAT?

02:35:06.897 --> 02:35:08.465
IS THAT FOR SHORTER HAUL

02:35:08.532 --> 02:35:10.634
TRUCKING THERE'S ABILITY TO RELY

02:35:10.701 --> 02:35:12.336
MORE ON THE ELECTRIC DRIVE TRAIN

02:35:12.403 --> 02:35:13.037
RATHER THAN.

02:35:13.103 --> 02:35:14.304
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FOR

02:35:14.371 --> 02:35:16.373
SHORTER DISTANCES I THINK I CAN

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:18.008
HELP WITH SOME OF THE GHC AND

02:35:18.075 --> 02:35:19.476
THAT IS ALSO BEEN LINKED BACK TO

02:35:19.543 --> 02:35:20.678
THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING THE

02:35:20.744 --> 02:35:22.212
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THESE TRANSFER

02:35:22.279 --> 02:35:23.981
HUBS JUST OUT OF SIGHT. MAJOR

02:35:24.048 --> 02:35:25.482
CITIES THAT WAS WOULD HELP WITH

02:35:25.549 --> 02:35:27.551
THIS FLOW.

02:35:27.618 --> 02:35:28.752
APPRECIATE IT SO I THINK THE

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:30.554
OUTCOME REALLY IS THE LOOKING

02:35:30.621 --> 02:35:31.855
HOW THE ELECTRIFICATION GOING

02:35:31.922 --> 02:35:34.091
TOWARDS. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:36.326
HYBRIDS OR WHATEVER THE THE

02:35:36.393 --> 02:35:38.128
COMPONENT IS THAT WE AS A

02:35:38.195 --> 02:35:39.797
LEGISLATURE. NEED TO BE

02:35:39.863 --> 02:35:42.366
CONSCIOUS OF THE THE IMPACT OF

02:35:42.433 --> 02:35:43.500
NOT BEING A PART OF THE.

02:35:44.702 --> 02:35:46.403
THE BIG PICTURE OF MAKING SURE

02:35:46.470 --> 02:35:48.205
THAT THE PLUGINS ARE READILY

02:35:48.272 --> 02:35:51.108
ACCESSIBLE TO TOOK AT AND. FOR

02:35:51.175 --> 02:35:52.876
THE MOBILITY OF THIS THIS

02:35:52.943 --> 02:35:55.079
TECHNOLOGY YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT

02:35:55.145 --> 02:35:55.746
CASE SCENARIOS WHERE.

02:35:55.813 --> 02:35:57.881
.

02:35:57.948 --> 02:35:59.483
WHEN YOU DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:35:59.550 --> 02:36:01.218
TO PROVIDE THE PICK UP AND PICK

02:36:01.285 --> 02:36:02.286
UP AREAS.

02:36:02.352 --> 02:36:03.854
THE FAST CHARGING THAT WOULD BE

02:36:03.921 --> 02:36:06.090
IMPERATIVE.

02:36:06.156 --> 02:36:07.725
HARD TO HAVE THAT THERE SO. YOU

02:36:07.791 --> 02:36:10.494
KNOW YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO.

02:36:10.561 --> 02:36:12.596
WITH YOUR POLITICAL WILL IN YOUR

02:36:12.663 --> 02:36:14.598
AND YOUR EXPERTISE.

02:36:14.665 --> 02:36:17.167
WHERE WE HAVE THE LEGISLATURE?

02:36:17.234 --> 02:36:18.969
CAN INTRODUCE ON WORK WITH OUR

02:36:19.036 --> 02:36:20.204
AGENCIES IT AND MAKE IT A

02:36:20.270 --> 02:36:22.639
PRIORITY. ANOTHER WAS AB EIGHT

02:36:22.706 --> 02:36:24.575
WAS CLOSE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.

02:36:24.641 --> 02:36:27.111
BUT IT HAS BEEN SO I WOULD SAY.

02:36:27.177 --> 02:36:29.980
A LEARNING PROCESS.

02:36:30.047 --> 02:36:31.582
OKAY I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE

02:36:31.648 --> 02:36:32.750
NEED TO HAVE PRIVATE INDUSTRY

02:36:32.816 --> 02:36:36.019
DRIVE THIS NO PUN INTENDED BUS.

02:36:36.086 --> 02:36:38.088
AND GET THIS THING GOING AND GET

02:36:38.155 --> 02:36:40.657
GRAY BUREAUCRACY OUT OF THE WAY.

02:36:40.724 --> 02:36:42.126
AND LET THE PRIVATE IS THREE

02:36:42.192 --> 02:36:44.061
TAKE IT OVER GET IT DONE SO THAT

02:36:44.128 --> 02:36:45.662
WE CAN PROMOTE AND GO OUT AND DO

02:36:45.729 --> 02:36:47.898
THIS GOOD STUFF. THAT WE WANT TO

02:36:47.965 --> 02:36:49.533
