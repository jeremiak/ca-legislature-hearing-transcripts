01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:34.195
TECHNICALLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:35.129
THE LANGUAGE OF THE CURRENT

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:38.432
LAW. BUT DEFINITELY NOT THE

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:40.167
SPIRIT OF THE LAW. IF EITHER

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:42.036
NAME INCLUDED THE WORD OIL IT

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:43.471
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:46.140
INTERPRETATION. THIS IS WHAT IS

01:35:46.207 --> 01:35:48.175
WHAT E KNOW AS A LOOPHOLE THIS

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:49.877
LAW HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:52.213
THE MID NINETIES. THOSE IN

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:53.914
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL DID NOT

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:55.816
ORIGINALLY INTEND TO DECEIVE.

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:57.318
BECAUSE THEY ALL STARTED BY

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:59.120
PRODUCING HOW 2% CALIFORNIA ALL

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:02.056

01:36:02.123 --> 01:36:03.657
DECISION OF THESE COMPANIES TO

01:36:03.724 --> 01:36:06.026
CREATE THE LOOPHOLE THE FLOOD

01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:08.629
TO MY BILL. JUST A FEW YEARS

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:10.464
AGO MY OPPONENTS PRODUCED A

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:13.934
PRODUCT WITH A 100% CALIFORNIA

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:16.670
ALL OF POLYPS. THAT PRODUCT WAS

01:36:16.737 --> 01:36:18.539
CHANGED SHORTLY AFTER TENS OF

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:19.540
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:21.175
INVESTED BY AN EAST COAST AND

01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:23.744
DOWN WITH. I FELT I FULLY

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:26.280
SUPPORT THEIR RIGHT TO PRODUCE

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:28.415
A PRODUCT AS THEY CHOOSE. BUT

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:31.018
USING CALIFORNIA ON A LABEL

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:33.454
WITH THE BLEND USING AS LOW AS

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:35.923
14% OF THE CALIFORNIA FALLS IS

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:37.691
NOT A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF

01:36:37.758 --> 01:36:40.995
THE PRODUCT. AND BY THE WAY

01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:41.629
THAT NUMBER COMES DIRECTLY FROM

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:44.431
THEM. WELL THEY DISCLOSE IN

01:36:44.498 --> 01:36:46.433
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW THE

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.036
PRODUCT IS BLENDED MOST

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:51.705
CONSUMERS ARE NOT AWARE.

01:36:51.772 --> 01:36:53.807
CALIFORNIA STANDARDS NOT EXCUSE

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.442

01:36:55.509 --> 01:36:57.478
APPLY 21100% CALIFORNIA OLIVE

01:36:57.545 --> 01:37:00.648
OIL. THE USE OF THE TERM IS NOT

01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:01.415
AN INNOCENT MARKETING OF A

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:03.484
BRAND IT DECEIVES THOSE WHO

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.386
THINK THEY'RE GETTING A 100%

01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:07.855
CALIFORNIA OIL. WITH ALL THE

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:09.823
STANDARDS WE MAKE OUR FARMERS

01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:11.592
LEVINE. THIS INACCURATE

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.194
LABELING HAS NOT ONLY CAUSED

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.196
CONSUMER CONFUSION BUT IT ALSO

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:16.530
LED TO A DEPRESSION IN THE

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:18.999
PRICE OF CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL.

01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:21.802
IN PLACE CALIFORNIA GROWERS AT

01:37:21.869 --> 01:37:23.437
A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. IN

CALIFORNIA BRED FOR THIS REASON.

01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:35.849
AND WHILE THIS PRACTICE

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:38.252
CONCERNS ME WHAT CONCERNS ME

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:40.221
MORE IS THIS RECENT DEVELOPMENT

01:37:40.287 --> 01:37:42.389

01:37:44.291 --> 01:37:47.394

ATTEND OR REVERSE ANY CURRENT

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:50.911
LAW AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:53.847

01:41:15.369 --> 01:41:16.603
DECEPTIVE PRACTICES THAT

OCCURRED WHEN SPECIFIC HIGH

DIDN'T ORIGINATE FROM THOSE

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:25.979
EGIONS. AND NOW THE SAME

01:41:26.046 --> 01:41:27.281
DECEPTIVE PRACTICES ARE BEING

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:29.016
USED IN ALL OF OIL AND THESE

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:29.850
COMPANIES ARE USING THE

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.552
ILLUSTRIOUS REPUTATIONS OF

01:41:31.618 --> 01:41:34.688
CALIFORNIA IN NAPA VALLEY ON

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:36.356
THE ROLE OF OIL LABELS EVEN

01:41:36.423 --> 01:41:36.890
THOUGH THE OIL INSIDE THE

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.395
THOSE REGIONS. SO THE EXTRA

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:55.642
EXACTING THAN THE REGULATIONS

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:56.844
FOR PRODUCERS IN OTHER

ENACTED ALL THESE POLICIES

01:42:19.833 --> 01:42:21.001

GOOD CARE OF OUR LABOR FORCE.

IN OUR LAND. BUT TO BE

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:29.576
COMPLIANT IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE

01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:30.177
TO CHARGE A PREMIUM PRICE FOR

PRODUCED IN A PREMIUM REGION.

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.315
AND SO IT'S SUPER DISRUPTIVE TO

ISN'T UNUSUAL OR

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.416
GROUNDBREAKING. LEGISLATION IT

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:10.617
JUST BRINGS THE HEALTH AND

OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE

01:55:37.964 --> 01:55:39.766
TRYING TO MODEL LIST SIMILAR TO

01:55:39.832 --> 01:55:42.435
LET'S SAY THE NAPA MODEL WHERE

01:55:42.502 --> 01:55:45.571
THE WINE INDUSTRY. REGULATED

01:55:45.638 --> 01:55:47.540
ITSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAD.

01:55:47.607 --> 01:55:49.509
AT LEAST A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE

01:55:49.575 --> 01:55:53.479
OF. ORIGIN FROM CALIFORNIA FOR

01:55:53.546 --> 01:55:56.382
A REGIONAL AREA SUCH AS IT IS

01:55:56.449 --> 01:55:59.752
TODAY WITH 85% THAT'S WHAT

01:55:59.819 --> 01:56:00.286
YOU'VE MODEL HERE IS THAT

01:56:00.353 --> 01:56:06.259
CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT- WHAT

01:56:06.326 --> 01:56:09.095
THE DIFFICULTY IS WITH WINE

01:56:09.162 --> 01:56:11.764
WINE IS PROTECTED UNDER THE

01:56:11.831 --> 01:56:13.299
TWENTY FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:15.935
CONSTITUTION BUT OLIVE OIL IS

01:56:16.002 --> 01:56:18.204
DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S IN FACT

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:19.072
IT WOULD EVEN BE IN THIS

01:56:19.138 --> 01:56:21.207
COMMITTEE IF IT WAS WHITE IT

01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:22.542
WOULD BE SOMEPLACE ELSE BUT

01:56:22.608 --> 01:56:24.344
BECAUSE THIS IS A FOOD AND

01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:25.511
THERE ARE FEDERAL LAWS

01:56:25.578 --> 01:56:28.514
REGULATING FOOD LABELING HOW DO

01:56:28.581 --> 01:56:29.082
YOU PROPOSE. THAT THIS BILL

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:32.685
AVOID. THE VERY REGULATIONS

01:56:32.752 --> 01:56:34.187
IT'S GOING TO NOW BE CHARGED

01:56:34.253 --> 01:56:41.828
WITH VIOLATING. THE COUPLE OF

01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:43.930
THE THINGS THAT I JUST WANT TO

01:56:43.996 --> 01:56:46.065
MAKE CLEAR IS THAT- THE

01:56:46.132 --> 01:56:49.168
CALIFORNIA- FORMS- CALIFORNIA

01:56:49.235 --> 01:56:53.639
OIL. THEY LAUNCH THEIR NEW LINE

01:56:53.706 --> 01:56:54.874
WITH BALLOONS IN TWO THOUSAND

01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:57.877
EIGHTEEN. AND THEY COMPILE AND-

01:56:57.944 --> 01:56:59.379
THEY COMPLIED WITH A HUNDRED

01:56:59.445 --> 01:57:01.314
PERCENT- REQUIREMENT BEFORE

01:57:01.381 --> 01:57:05.017
THEN. THEY WERE PURCHASED BY

01:57:05.084 --> 01:57:07.754
ENDOWMENT AND SO THEY HAVE NOT

01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:09.889
BEEN DOING THIS FOR TWENTY

01:57:09.956 --> 01:57:11.858
THREE YEARS JUST FOR STARTERS.

01:57:11.924 --> 01:57:13.459
THEY LEAD THE WAY ON CREATING

01:57:13.526 --> 01:57:15.528
CALIFORNIA BRAND WE NEED TO

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:17.230
GIVE THEM A GOOD THEY DID A

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:18.498
GREAT THING UNFORTUNATE ALL

01:57:18.564 --> 01:57:20.733
THEY'VE BEEN THEY'VE NOW LEAD

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.336
THE WAY TO GO AROUND IT. AND

01:57:23.403 --> 01:57:24.203
THAT'S WHERE MY CONCERN IS WITH

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:26.005
THIS. THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:28.007
THING THE LABELING WAS FINE AT

01:57:28.074 --> 01:57:30.676
THAT TIME AND THEN NOW IT'S NOT

01:57:30.743 --> 01:57:32.245
THE LABELING IT WAS THE PRODUCT

01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:33.212
THE CHANGE IN THE PRODUCT

01:57:33.279 --> 01:57:35.181
CHANGE FROM 1100% ALL

01:57:35.248 --> 01:57:37.683
CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL. TO A

01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:39.352
BLEND. AND THAT'S WHERE BUT

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:45.291
THAT'S WHAT THE ISSUE IS. THANK

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:48.528
YOU FOR THAT- ANSWER I

01:57:48.594 --> 01:57:50.763
APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT'S

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:51.497
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALL

01:57:51.564 --> 01:57:53.599
FIND. DIFFICULT HERE BECAUSE

01:57:53.666 --> 01:57:55.401
THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:56.769
ARE REALLY BEFORE US MISTER

01:57:56.836 --> 01:57:59.539
CHAIRMAN. WHEN WE START TALKING

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:01.340
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES. IT GETS

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:02.775
INTO THE CHALLENGES OF DO WE

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:03.976
WANT TO TAKE ON OTHER THINGS TO

01:58:04.043 --> 01:58:06.245
SAY CALIFORNIA. BY CALIFORNIA

01:58:06.312 --> 01:58:09.282
PIZZA. DO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:58:09.348 --> 01:58:11.217
OTHER IN THE ENTITIES THAT.

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:14.620
ANDERSON VALLEY- BREWERY WERE

01:58:14.687 --> 01:58:16.689
PICKING UPON REGIONAL AREAS.

01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:19.959
THIS GETS REALLY DOWN PRETTY

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:22.295
WEEDY AND DIFFICULT FOR US TO

01:58:22.361 --> 01:58:24.063
REGULATE BECAUSE IT OPENS A

01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:25.531
SLIPPERY SLOPE TO A LOT OF

01:58:25.598 --> 01:58:29.402
ISSUES. IN THE STATE. I THINK

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:32.171
IN RESPECT FOR THE TWO PARTIES

01:58:32.238 --> 01:58:33.940
HERE THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR US

01:58:34.006 --> 01:58:35.374
TO HAVE THEM COME TOGETHER AND

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:37.276
WORK ON AN ANSWER. OF

01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:39.979
ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS

01:58:40.046 --> 01:58:41.814
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF- TEAK.

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:45.051
OIL PRODUCERS IN THIS STATE AND

01:58:45.117 --> 01:58:47.186
THEY'RE BLENDING. THE QUESTION

01:58:47.253 --> 01:58:49.121
IS HOW DO THEY PLAN AND USE THE

01:58:49.188 --> 01:58:51.557
WORD CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S MY

01:58:51.624 --> 01:58:52.525
REAL CONCERN BECAUSE I THINK

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:54.627
THE TRADEMARK. IN THIS

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:57.797
PARTICULAR CASE THAT I

01:58:57.864 --> 01:59:00.266
IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL IS

01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:01.467
GOING TO BE THE COMPROMISING

01:59:01.534 --> 01:59:03.202
SITUATION BECAUSE ACROSS THE

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:04.737
LINE INTO PROTECTIONS UNDER THE

01:59:04.804 --> 01:59:06.606
FEDERAL LAW SO I THINK THIS

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:09.108
BILL IS A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE

01:59:09.175 --> 01:59:11.644
AND IT'S WORKING BECAUSE AS THE

01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:14.080
AUTHOR JUST ADDRESSED. TALKING

01:59:14.146 --> 01:59:16.516
ABOUT THE ISSUE OF BRINGING

01:59:16.582 --> 01:59:19.285
DIFFERENT BLAND'S FORD. THEY'VE

01:59:19.352 --> 01:59:20.887
ACTUALLY ALREADY COVERED AND

01:59:20.953 --> 01:59:22.121
STAYED WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF

01:59:22.188 --> 01:59:23.556
THIS WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:24.924
DO OR WHAT THE AUTHORS TRYING

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:26.826
TO DO YOU SEE IT ALL LABELS ON

EVERY BOTTLE. THAT'S PRESENTED.

01:59:30.329 --> 01:59:32.498
SO IT'S ALREADY IDENTIFIED SO

01:59:32.565 --> 01:59:33.599
THEY'RE MEETING THE NEEDS SO

01:59:33.666 --> 01:59:35.234
NOW COMES DOWN TO REALLY.

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:37.136
SOMEONE OR SOMEONES ARE

01:59:37.203 --> 01:59:40.139
CONTESTING THE USE OF THE NAME.

TO ADDRESS. THAT TRADEMARK NAME

01:59:53.753 --> 01:59:54.587
THAT'S WHAT THIS DEBATE IS

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:56.055
REALLY ABOUT HAS NOTHING TO DO

01:59:56.122 --> 01:59:59.158
WITH THE LABELING. IS BIG

DO HERE BUT I THINK IT'S

02:00:07.466 --> 02:00:09.769
PREMATURE FOR US TO SUPPORT

02:00:09.835 --> 02:00:11.170

IT TO THE AUTHOR WHEN USED IN

02:01:35.821 --> 02:01:38.891
YOUR OPENING YOU UP AND I DON'T

02:01:38.958 --> 02:01:39.759
KNOW IF IT'S CLEAR I'M LOOKING

02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:42.028
IN THE ANALYSIS NOW THAT UNDER

02:01:42.094 --> 02:01:46.332
EXISTING LAW- BEFORE THIS THAT-

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:47.667
BED YOU CAN'T SAY YOU'RE

02:01:47.733 --> 02:01:51.737
CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL- AND THAT

02:01:51.804 --> 02:01:53.906
IF THE CURRENT. BRAND NAME WAS

02:01:53.973 --> 02:01:56.342
CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL BRANCH

02:01:56.409 --> 02:01:57.810
FOR INSTANCE THAT WOULD ALREADY

02:01:57.877 --> 02:02:00.479
BE- WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

02:02:00.546 --> 02:02:02.415
ILLEGAL TO BE ABLE TO DO THE

02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:03.916
UNDER EXISTING LAW DID I HEAR

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:07.720
THAT CORRECTLY. SO WHEN BUT IN

02:02:07.787 --> 02:02:09.522
THE PAST AS I SAID THEY HAD

02:02:09.588 --> 02:02:12.191
GOTTEN THEY WERE CALIFORNIA ALL

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:13.225
OF OIL THEY WERE A HUNDRED

02:02:13.292 --> 02:02:16.095
PERCENT. THEY WERE PURCHASED.

02:02:16.162 --> 02:02:20.232
WHEN THEY'RE PURCHASED. THE NEW

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:23.669
OWNERS- CONTINUE TO USE THE

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:26.439
LABEL AND THEY HAVE OTHER

02:02:26.505 --> 02:02:28.874
BLENDED PRODUCT I DON'T HAVE A

02:02:28.941 --> 02:02:30.609
PROBLEM WITH THE PRODUCT THAT'S

02:02:30.676 --> 02:02:33.579
ABSOLUTELY FINE. WHEN YOU MIL

02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:35.181
ALL OF WALES IN CALIFORNIA IT

02:02:35.247 --> 02:02:37.450
IS AN ART IT IS AN ART AND

02:02:37.516 --> 02:02:38.818
THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING IT

02:02:38.884 --> 02:02:40.586
OUR FARMERS AND OUR MIDDLE

02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:43.089
MIDDLE PEOPLE- HAVE HIGH

02:02:43.155 --> 02:02:45.758
QUALITY EQUIPMENT. AND WE HAVE

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:47.593
TO I THINK WE SHOULD HONOR THAT

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:49.562
SO WHERE I'MGOING WITH THIS IS

02:02:49.628 --> 02:02:52.832
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

02:02:52.898 --> 02:02:54.633
REALIZE THAT ADDITIONALLY THEY

02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:58.237
HAVE THE RIGHT THEY HAD THE

02:02:58.304 --> 02:02:59.004
WHEN THEY ARE PURCHASED BY

02:02:59.071 --> 02:03:01.073
SOMEONE ELSE I FEEL LIKE THEY

02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:03.743
HAVE UNDERMINE OUR FARMERS IN

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:07.780
CALIFORNIA ALL FARMERS. OKAY I

02:03:07.847 --> 02:03:11.083
AM- I HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION

02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:12.418
LAST WEEK WITH THAT THE COMPANY

02:03:12.485 --> 02:03:14.386
IN QUESTION. I ACTUALLY WENT

02:03:14.453 --> 02:03:15.988
THROUGH THEIR LABELING- AND- I

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:18.491
THINK OF ANYBODY THAT LOOKED AT

02:03:18.557 --> 02:03:19.692
AND I THINK THEY'VE COME A LONG

02:03:19.759 --> 02:03:20.893
WAY IN MAKING SURE THAT TO

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:25.131
SEPARATE- THE CALIFORNIA. BRAND

02:03:25.197 --> 02:03:26.198
TO THE OTHER BLENDED FROM UP

02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:28.434
FROM- THAT WITH OILS THAT ARE

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:29.101
THAT ARE GLOBAL I'M GONNA

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:31.771
SUPPORT THIS- TODAY AND IN MY

02:03:31.837 --> 02:03:33.606
LINE OF THINKING FOR SUPPORTING

02:03:33.672 --> 02:03:36.275
IT TODAY. IS THAT IF WE COULD

02:03:36.342 --> 02:03:38.644
GO BACK ON THEM IT TABULAR ROSS

02:03:38.711 --> 02:03:41.413
SAID IF WE KNEW. IN THE FUTURE-

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.682
WHAT WHAT WHAT DID THE MARKET

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:45.785
PLACE WAS GOING TO LOOK LIKE I

02:03:45.851 --> 02:03:46.285
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:03:46.352 --> 02:03:48.487
CALIFORNIA. OF FOR US AS

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:50.523
CALIFORNIANS TO PROTECT THE

02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:52.725
CALIFORNIA BRAND NOT JUST IN

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:55.161
REGARDS TO ALL OF OIL- BUT FOR

02:03:55.227 --> 02:03:58.664
ALL THINGS AND IT WAS. DOWN MY-

02:03:58.731 --> 02:04:00.599
MY OTHER COLLEAGUE SPOKE ABOUT

02:04:00.666 --> 02:04:01.734
THE STEVEN KING OF QUEBEC

02:04:01.801 --> 02:04:03.302
CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN. AND

02:04:03.369 --> 02:04:04.470
IF YOU GO THROUGH A GROCERY

02:04:04.537 --> 02:04:05.704
STORE NOW YOU CAN SEE A BUNCH

02:04:05.771 --> 02:04:08.207
OF BRANDS SO NOT. PRODUCTS

02:04:08.274 --> 02:04:09.575
DESCRIBING PRODUCTS BUT THEIR

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:11.443
ACTUAL BRAND USING THE

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:13.078
CALIFORNIA NAME AND I THINK

02:04:13.145 --> 02:04:14.814
THERE'S A QUESTION. ABOUT MAKE

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.415
THE ABOUT ABOUT WHETHER WE

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:18.083
SHOULD PROTECT AND WHO OWNS-

02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:19.952
THAT THAT THAT NAME I NOW WE

02:04:20.019 --> 02:04:21.120
CAN START TO GO DOWN TO ALL THE

02:04:21.187 --> 02:04:22.488
DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND- WE GO

02:04:22.555 --> 02:04:24.056
DOWN TO CITIES AND ALL OF THAT

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:25.991
DOES WELL BUT- I DO THINK

02:04:26.058 --> 02:04:27.493
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.728
AND IF THIS HAD COME BEFORE US-

02:04:29.795 --> 02:04:32.198
I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED IT- AND

02:04:32.264 --> 02:04:33.899
KNOWING THAT- THERE WASN'T A

02:04:33.966 --> 02:04:35.167
COMPANY THAT HAD A TWENTY THREE

02:04:35.234 --> 02:04:36.602
YEAR OLD TRADEMARKS ALL BE

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:38.170

GOOD LEGISLATOR AND SHE'S GONNA

02:04:43.008 --> 02:04:44.343
BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH- SOME

02:04:44.410 --> 02:04:45.711
OF THESE THINGS WORK IT AND

02:04:45.778 --> 02:04:46.679
WORK IT OUT AS IT WORKS TO THE

02:04:46.745 --> 02:04:51.717
PROCESS- SO AGAIN I'LL BE

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND-

02:04:57.156 --> 02:04:59.024
KIND OF WHAT I'VE WAS GONNA SAY

02:04:59.091 --> 02:05:00.960
IS ALREADY BEEN STE STATED BUT

02:05:01.026 --> 02:05:01.460
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO

02:05:01.527 --> 02:05:02.895
REITERATE IT BECAUSE I AM IN

02:05:02.962 --> 02:05:05.464
THE SUPPORT THIS BILL. BUT I DO

02:05:05.531 --> 02:05:07.833
ACTUALLY THINK THAT. THE

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:12.705
COMPANY IN QUESTION- IS DOING

02:05:12.771 --> 02:05:15.207
WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THEM. WE

02:05:15.274 --> 02:05:17.776
CAN HAVE THE CONVERSATION IS

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:20.112
THAT ENOUGH MAYBE NOT. BUT I

02:05:20.179 --> 02:05:21.580
JUST PULLED UP THEIR WEBSITE

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:27.086
RIGHT HERE. AND. THE TOP ROCKER

02:05:27.152 --> 02:05:27.720
THAT ABSOLUTELY SAYS CALIFORNIA

02:05:27.786 --> 02:05:30.256
OLIVE RANCH. AND THIS IS ON THE

02:05:30.322 --> 02:05:32.758
GLOBAL SERIES. BUT AT THE

02:05:32.825 --> 02:05:36.095
BOTTOM. IT TALKS ABOUT WHERE

02:05:36.161 --> 02:05:36.629
SOME OF THE OTHER OILS ARE

02:05:36.695 --> 02:05:39.431
COMING FROM. THEN YOU GO TO THE

02:05:39.498 --> 02:05:42.134
HOW 2% CALIFORNIA PART OF IT.

02:05:42.201 --> 02:05:45.471
IT'S LABELED A 100% CALIFORNIA.

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:46.705
I AM SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:48.007
BECAUSE AS A GUY THAT CAME FROM

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:51.076
AG. ANY AMOUNT OF REGULATORY

02:05:51.143 --> 02:05:53.445
BURDEN AND WHAT IT MEANS TO DO

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:53.946
BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:56.348
CALIFORNIA. PROTECTING THE

02:05:56.415 --> 02:05:59.685
CALIFORNIA BRAND. IS INCREDIBLY

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:02.187
IMPORTANT TO ME. IT'S

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:05.491
INCREDIBLY- FRUSTRATING AT

02:06:05.557 --> 02:06:08.160
TIMES QUITE FRANKLY WHEN YOU

02:06:08.227 --> 02:06:09.828
SEE OTHER PRODUCTS IMPORTED

02:06:09.895 --> 02:06:12.231
UNDER OUR NAME KNOWING WHAT IT

02:06:12.298 --> 02:06:14.700
COSTS OUR GROWERS TO PRODUCE

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:18.871
THAT COMMODITY. BUT I DO FIND

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:20.039
IT SOMEWHAT INTERESTING THAT

02:06:20.105 --> 02:06:22.908
THIS PARTICULAR ALL OF OIL IS

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:23.475
BECOMING KIND THE NEXUS FOR

02:06:23.542 --> 02:06:25.711
THIS FIGHT. IT'S KIND OF THE

02:06:25.778 --> 02:06:27.446
TIP OF THE SPEAR AND I DO

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:27.880
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS

02:06:27.947 --> 02:06:30.182
UNFORTUNATE. BECAUSE I DO

02:06:30.249 --> 02:06:32.318
BELIEVE. THAT THEY ARE

02:06:32.384 --> 02:06:35.020
FOLLOWING THE LAW. THAT THEY

ARTICLES FOCUSED ON

03:00:10.566 --> 03:00:12.234
BODYBUILDING IT DOES NOT SAY

03:00:12.301 --> 03:00:13.302
ANYTHING ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS

03:00:13.369 --> 03:00:15.271

THAT WITH MORE WORK IN DIALOGUE

THERE IS A WAY TO THREAD THE

HAPPENS. WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS

03:58:35.901 --> 03:58:39.004
ADMITTED INTO THE ER ROOM. AS I

03:58:39.071 --> 03:58:42.007
SAID VERY SPECIFICALLY EARLY ON

03:58:42.074 --> 03:58:46.278
IN IN MY COMMENTS- THIS BILL

03:58:46.345 --> 03:58:47.746
REQUIRES HOSPITAL EMERGENCY

03:58:47.813 --> 03:58:49.348
DEPARTMENTS TO OFFER AN HIV

03:58:49.415 --> 03:58:51.817
TEST THAT ANY PATIENT FOR WHOM

03:58:51.884 --> 03:58:53.252
A BLOOD DROP IS ALREADY BEING

03:58:53.318 --> 03:58:56.321
DONE. SECOND IT REQUIRES A

03:58:56.388 --> 03:58:59.458
CONSENT SO IF A PATIENT IS IN A

03:58:59.525 --> 03:59:01.293
LIFE THREATENING CIRCUMSTANCES

03:59:01.360 --> 03:59:02.294
THEY'VE BEEN ADMITTED TO THE

03:59:02.361 --> 03:59:04.363
HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY WERE IN

03:59:04.430 --> 03:59:07.666
A- ACCIDENT. DAY CAN'T SPEAK

03:59:07.733 --> 03:59:09.702
THEY WILL NOT BE ASKED FOR

03:59:09.768 --> 03:59:11.303
CONSENT THEY WILL JUST NOT BE

03:59:11.370 --> 03:59:13.639
GIVEN THAT TEST. BECAUSE IT

03:59:13.706 --> 03:59:15.441
WILL NOT HAPPEN UNLESS THEY

03:59:15.507 --> 03:59:17.443
CONSCIOUSLY GIVE A VERBAL

03:59:17.509 --> 03:59:20.179
CONSENT TO THE TEST- TO THIS

03:59:20.245 --> 03:59:22.414
TESTING WE'VE BEEN AND I DO

03:59:22.481 --> 03:59:23.615
APPRECIATE MR MADDEN ALSO

03:59:23.682 --> 03:59:24.516
POINTING OUT THAT I'VE BEEN

03:59:24.583 --> 03:59:25.918
WORKING ON THIS SINCE I WAS

03:59:25.984 --> 03:59:27.186
FIRST ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND

03:59:27.252 --> 03:59:29.688
THIRTEEN. THIS IS THIS IS BEEN

03:59:29.755 --> 03:59:34.393
pTIME. AFTER THE MAGIC JOHNSON

03:59:34.460 --> 03:59:36.895
GENERATION. OF YOUTH WHO WERE

03:59:36.962 --> 03:59:38.764
IMPACTED WHEN MAGIC JOHNSON

03:59:38.831 --> 03:59:41.366
CONTRACTED HIV AND THE WHOLE

03:59:41.433 --> 03:59:44.536
WORLD BECAME MORE AWARE. OF

03:59:44.603 --> 03:59:47.072
WHAT HIV DOES EVERYONE TOOK

03:59:47.139 --> 03:59:49.241
MORE PRECAUTIONS- THE

03:59:49.308 --> 03:59:51.043
TECHNOLOGY AROUND HEALTH CARE

03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:53.612
ALSO ADVANCED WE WERE ABLE TO

03:59:53.679 --> 03:59:55.881
COME UP WITH. CARE THAT IS NOW

03:59:55.948 --> 03:59:58.350
MORE AFFORDABLE- AND ALLOWS

03:59:58.417 --> 03:59:59.852
PEOPLE TO LIVE LONGER BUT THE

03:59:59.918 --> 04:00:01.787
REALITY IS WE STILL NEED TO

04:00:01.854 --> 04:00:03.255
MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP CATCHING

04:00:03.322 --> 04:00:05.758
IT EARLY ENOUGH SO THAT WE CAN

04:00:05.824 --> 04:00:06.859
PROVIDE THE HEALTH ARE

04:00:06.925 --> 04:00:09.061
NECESSARY SO THAT THERE AREN'T

04:00:09.128 --> 04:00:11.029
OTHER CONSEQUENCES AS WELL. AS

04:00:11.096 --> 04:00:14.032
WELL AS A RAPID RAPIDLY GROWING

04:00:14.099 --> 04:00:15.901
RATE OF INFECTION ESPECIALLY

04:00:15.968 --> 04:00:17.970
AMONG YOUNGER THE AGE RANGE

04:00:18.036 --> 04:00:18.871
THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

04:00:18.937 --> 04:00:20.606
WHICH TENDS TO BE MORE

04:00:20.672 --> 04:00:25.144
PROMISCUOUS. AND ENGAGE IN

04:00:25.210 --> 04:00:27.346
RISKY BEHAVIOR. SORRY I WENT ON

04:00:27.412 --> 04:00:28.781
A BIT LONGER THAN WHAT YOUR

04:00:28.847 --> 04:00:31.350
QUESTION WAS ASKING BUT WAS

04:00:31.416 --> 04:00:31.884
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT I

04:00:31.950 --> 04:00:34.419
CAPTURE EVERYTHING. I JUST-

04:00:34.486 --> 04:00:36.255
THIS IS AN ABOUT AN IMPORTANT

04:00:36.321 --> 04:00:38.056
ISSUE TO ME- I KNOW ALONG WITH

04:00:38.123 --> 04:00:40.392
MY OTHER COLLEAGUE- FROM THE

04:00:40.459 --> 04:00:42.194
COACHELLA VALLEY WE'VE- WORKED

04:00:42.261 --> 04:00:44.163
ON CAMPAIGNS WITH- GET TESTED

04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:45.497
COACHELLA VALLEY BECAUSE JUST

04:00:45.564 --> 04:00:46.799
YOUR POINT THE MORE PEOPLE THAT

04:00:46.865 --> 04:00:48.400
ARE TESTED THE DON'T KNOW. THE

04:00:48.467 --> 04:00:52.671
BETTER OFF- THE TECHNOLOGY THE

04:00:52.738 --> 04:00:54.807
SCIENCE- IS IT IS GOTTEN IS

04:00:54.873 --> 04:00:56.108
BECOME AMAZING I THINK OF PREP

04:00:56.175 --> 04:00:58.277
AND PAT. AND THE EARLIER THAT

04:00:58.343 --> 04:00:59.711
YOU CATCH IT THE ABILITY TO BE

04:00:59.778 --> 04:01:02.214
ABLE TO ARREST IT- IS- IS THERE

04:01:02.281 --> 04:01:06.051
AND SO- YOUR YOUR DESIRE TO

04:01:06.118 --> 04:01:08.854
WANT TO WORK IN THE SPACE- I'M-

04:01:08.921 --> 04:01:10.689
ALSO VERY SYMPATHETIC I JUST

04:01:10.756 --> 04:01:12.391
I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'VE GOT

04:01:12.457 --> 04:01:13.725
EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS

04:01:13.792 --> 04:01:15.127
SAYING THAT THIS THIS IS GOING

04:01:15.194 --> 04:01:17.062
TO CREATE. ISSUES FOR THAT I'M

04:01:17.129 --> 04:01:18.130
AND I'M TRYING TO SQUARE THE

04:01:18.197 --> 04:01:20.299
CIRCLE A LITTLE BIT. A LITTLE

04:01:20.365 --> 04:01:22.467
BIT THERE AND- AND SO YOU KNOW

04:01:22.534 --> 04:01:24.503
AGAIN I'VE I GUESS I'D WHAT I

04:01:24.570 --> 04:01:26.572
HEARD FROM YOU IS THAT MAYBE

04:01:26.638 --> 04:01:27.940
THE EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS

04:01:28.006 --> 04:01:28.774
DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE

04:01:28.841 --> 04:01:29.775
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL OR THE OR

04:01:29.842 --> 04:01:31.577
IS THERE MORE WORK TO BE DONE.

04:01:31.643 --> 04:01:33.979
A TO BE DONE HERE. I LOOK I'VE

04:01:34.046 --> 04:01:36.014
MADE MYSELF AVAILABLE I'VE

04:01:36.081 --> 04:01:39.952
WORKED WITH THEM IN. EVERY

04:01:40.018 --> 04:01:41.286
TURN. THIS IS. I I'VE DONE NOW

04:01:41.353 --> 04:01:43.922
WHAT THE FIRST BILL WAS VETOED.

04:01:43.989 --> 04:01:45.791
AT THE SECOND ONE WAS NARROWLY

04:01:45.858 --> 04:01:47.593
CRAFTED SO THAT IT WOULD CREATE

04:01:47.659 --> 04:01:50.495
THE PILOT PROGRAMS THAT ENDED

04:01:50.562 --> 04:01:52.197
UP RESULTING IN THE STUDY THAT

04:01:52.264 --> 04:01:53.398
DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS A

04:01:53.465 --> 04:01:56.301
NEED WHEN 2% THERE IS 2%

04:01:56.368 --> 04:01:58.370
INFECTION RATE. YET WE'RE NOT

04:01:58.437 --> 04:02:00.172
TALKING ABOUT FRACTIONS ANYMORE

04:02:00.239 --> 04:02:02.007
IT'S TO HOLD BODIES BEING

04:02:02.074 --> 04:02:04.476
INFECTED AND EXT PASSING IT ON

04:02:04.543 --> 04:02:07.679
TO OTHERS- AND THAT'S WHY WE

04:02:07.746 --> 04:02:10.249
LOOK. GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE

04:02:10.315 --> 04:02:13.352
STUDY AND WHEN SEVEN OVER

04:02:13.418 --> 04:02:13.952
SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE

04:02:14.019 --> 04:02:15.120
PARTICIPATED IN THIS AND HAVE

04:02:15.187 --> 04:02:17.055
BEEN STUDY AND BY THE WAY LET'S

04:02:17.122 --> 04:02:18.857
NOT FORGET SEVENTY THOUSAND WHO

04:02:18.924 --> 04:02:21.760
GAVE CONSENT. TO BE TESTED. SO

04:02:21.827 --> 04:02:24.263
IT'S EVEN A SUBSET OF EVERYONE

04:02:24.329 --> 04:02:25.697
WHO'S BEEN ADMITTED TO THE C.

04:02:25.764 --> 04:02:27.933
R. ROOMS. UP WHEN YOU HAVE

04:02:28.000 --> 04:02:29.835
THESE NUMBERS WHICH BY THE WAY

04:02:29.902 --> 04:02:31.303
THE REASON I'M BRINGING THAT UP

04:02:31.370 --> 04:02:33.772
IS BECAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

04:02:33.839 --> 04:02:37.276
WHO WHO ARE. CONDUCTING AND

04:02:37.342 --> 04:02:37.876
EXPOSING THEMSELVES TO RISKY

04:02:37.943 --> 04:02:41.947
BEHAVIOR- ARE PROP PROBABLY IF

04:02:42.014 --> 04:02:43.949
THEY WERE TESTED MOST OF THOSE

04:02:44.016 --> 04:02:46.718
I'M BETTING WE'RE NOT WILLING

04:02:46.785 --> 04:02:48.387
TO BE TESTED. IS THEY DON'T

04:02:48.453 --> 04:02:50.055
UNFORTUNATELY WANT TO KNOW WHAT

04:02:50.122 --> 04:02:52.124
THE OUTCOME MIGHT BE SO IT

04:02:52.190 --> 04:02:53.825
FURTHER SKEWS THAT REPORT I

04:02:53.892 --> 04:02:55.227
WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THIS

04:02:55.294 --> 04:02:57.129
NUMBER WOULD HAVE TO WOULD BE

04:02:57.195 --> 04:03:00.399
EVEN HIGHER. IF EVERYONE WAS

04:03:00.465 --> 04:03:06.505
EXPECTED TO TEST. SO EIGHT I AM

04:03:06.571 --> 04:03:08.740
HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH

04:03:08.807 --> 04:03:12.177
THE ARM DOCTORS- BECAUSE I DO

04:03:12.244 --> 04:03:13.345
NOT WANT THIS TO BE A

04:03:13.412 --> 04:03:15.414
BURDENSOME ISSUE BUT I DO

04:03:15.480 --> 04:03:17.082
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A VERY

04:03:17.149 --> 04:03:19.017
CRITICAL PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE AT

04:03:19.084 --> 04:03:24.456
STAKE AS WELL STDS HAVE GONE UP.

04:03:24.523 --> 04:03:25.624
GOING BACK TO THE PREVIOUS

04:03:25.691 --> 04:03:26.925
POINT I MADE ABOUT THE MAGIC

04:03:26.992 --> 04:03:29.561
JOHNSON ERA IT SEEMS THAT AFTER

04:03:29.628 --> 04:03:30.729
TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE MAGIC

04:03:30.796 --> 04:03:33.432
JOHNSON PHENOMENA. MOST FOLKS

04:03:33.498 --> 04:03:35.100
STARTED TO WITH AND WITH THE

04:03:35.167 --> 04:03:36.568
ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY I

04:03:36.635 --> 04:03:38.737
THINK THIS RECENT GENERATION

04:03:38.804 --> 04:03:42.808
HAS- FORGOTTEN WHAT THE

04:03:42.874 --> 04:03:44.076
PREVIOUS GENERATION WENT

04:03:44.142 --> 04:03:46.144
THROUGH AND HOW CAREFUL WE HAD

04:03:46.211 --> 04:03:48.080
BECOME AND HOW MUCH MORE

04:03:48.146 --> 04:03:49.581
WILLING WE WERE TO TEST AND

04:03:49.648 --> 04:03:51.116
MAKE SURE WE KNEW WHAT WAS

04:03:51.183 --> 04:03:53.986
GOING ON WITH OUR BODIES- AND

04:03:54.052 --> 04:03:54.987
IT'S BEING DONE AT THE

04:03:55.053 --> 04:03:55.754
DETRIMENT OF THIS NEW

04:03:55.821 --> 04:03:58.991
GENERATION. AND SO WE NEED TO.

04:03:59.057 --> 04:04:03.595
PUT BACK CERTAIN- TESTING INTO

04:04:03.662 --> 04:04:05.097
PLACE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE

04:04:05.163 --> 04:04:06.932
THAT THE PEOPLE ARE THIS

04:04:06.999 --> 04:04:10.669
GENERATION. ISN'T LOST IN IN

04:04:10.736 --> 04:04:12.604
THIS FIGHT AND IF MISTER RAND

04:04:12.671 --> 04:04:14.106
WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING TO

04:04:14.172 --> 04:04:22.414
THIS I. THANK YOU IS THERE

04:04:22.481 --> 04:04:25.684
ANYONE ELSE. I JUST WANT TO

04:04:25.751 --> 04:04:27.352
MAKE TWO ADDITIONAL POINTS AS

04:04:27.419 --> 04:04:28.687
FROM POLYMER MISTER NAZARIAN

04:04:28.754 --> 04:04:30.455
SAID A NUMBER ONE THERE ARE

04:04:30.522 --> 04:04:31.957
OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'VE ALREADY

04:04:32.024 --> 04:04:33.825
BEGUN TALKING WITH CAL A STEP

04:04:33.892 --> 04:04:35.227
ABOUT AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO

04:04:35.293 --> 04:04:36.828
WE THINK WE CAN SAVE EVEN MORE

04:04:36.895 --> 04:04:38.964
TIME OFF THAT- IT WOULD ALSO

04:04:39.031 --> 04:04:40.265
LIKE TO POINT OUT WE WERE

04:04:40.332 --> 04:04:42.034
QUANTIFYING THE AMOUNT OF TIME.

04:04:42.100 --> 04:04:43.335
THE NUMBERS THAT WE WOULD

04:04:43.402 --> 04:04:43.935
CHALLENGE OF THE NUMBERS THAT

04:04:44.002 --> 04:04:45.837
THEY'RE USING BECAUSE THEY TALK

04:04:45.904 --> 04:04:48.040
ABOUT 42% OF EMERGENCY ROOM

04:04:48.106 --> 04:04:50.308
PATIENTS ARE GETTING A BLOOD

04:04:50.375 --> 04:04:52.044
DRAW TO BEGIN WITH- BUT THEN

04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:54.913
THEY USE THEIR CALCULATION AT

04:04:54.980 --> 04:04:56.748
THE FULL 100% OF PATIENTS TO

04:04:56.815 --> 04:04:58.617
COME UP WITH THEIR TWENTY EIGHT

04:04:58.683 --> 04:05:00.252
OR TWENTY NINE MILLION MINUTES

04:05:00.318 --> 04:05:02.087
AN ADDITIONAL TIME. SO WE THINK

04:05:02.154 --> 04:05:03.121
IT'S GOING TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY

04:05:03.188 --> 04:05:04.890
LESS WE TAKE OUT MOST OF THE

04:05:04.956 --> 04:05:06.858
THINGS THAT TAKE THE TIME- BUT

04:05:06.925 --> 04:05:07.592
IF THERE ARE MORE THINGS THAT

04:05:07.659 --> 04:05:09.461
WE CAN TAKE OUT THE TAKE OUT

04:05:09.528 --> 04:05:10.695
SOME ADDITIONAL TIME WE WILL DO

04:05:10.762 --> 04:05:12.531
THAT AS WELL THANK YOU THANK

04:05:12.597 --> 04:05:14.099
YOU AND THEN MISTER CHIEF YOU

04:05:14.166 --> 04:05:17.702
DON'T MIND I'D. LIKE TO ADD ONE

04:05:17.769 --> 04:05:18.303
MORE THING. AGAIN GIVEN THAT

04:05:18.370 --> 04:05:19.538
THE- TIMES THAT WE'VE WORKED ON

04:05:19.604 --> 04:05:22.441
THIS BILL. MAKING INTO A PILOT

04:05:22.507 --> 04:05:23.675
PROJECT AND THEN NOW MOVING

04:05:23.742 --> 04:05:27.112
FORWARD. IN ALL THOSE TIMES WE

04:05:27.179 --> 04:05:30.682
ALSO TRY TO CURTAIL THE BURDEN

04:05:30.749 --> 04:05:32.317
OF HAVING TO HAVE THE KEY OUR

04:05:32.384 --> 04:05:34.753
DOCTORS BE THE ONES EVEN EITHER

04:05:34.820 --> 04:05:36.922
COMMUNICATING THE INFORMATION-

04:05:36.988 --> 04:05:38.657
WE UNDERSTAND THEIR ER ROOM

04:05:38.723 --> 04:05:41.093
DOCTORS THEY SHOULD AND THEN

04:05:41.159 --> 04:05:43.295
SPACE. IT'S A VERY CRITICAL

04:05:43.361 --> 04:05:45.263
ISSUE WHEN YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN

04:05:45.330 --> 04:05:46.465
TO SOMEONE WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN

04:05:46.531 --> 04:05:47.532
INFECTED WITH WHEN THEY HAD NO

04:05:47.599 --> 04:05:49.668
IDEA THEY WERE COMING INTO THE

04:05:49.734 --> 04:05:50.535
HOSPITAL ROOM FOR SOME OTHER

04:05:50.602 --> 04:05:52.838
REASONS WE'VE GONE OUT OF OUR

04:05:52.904 --> 04:05:54.606
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN SOME

04:05:54.673 --> 04:05:56.374
OF THESE NUANCES THEY ARE NOT

04:05:56.441 --> 04:05:59.945
BURDENED WITH- TO IT AGAIN I'M

04:06:00.011 --> 04:06:01.580
HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON
