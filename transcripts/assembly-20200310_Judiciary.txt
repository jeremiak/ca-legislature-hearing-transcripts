MR GLORIA SO WE'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER THREE WHICH IS AB TWO OH NINE THREE WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINETY THREE THIS MORNING A FOR MANY OF YOU THIS BILL LOOKS EXTREMELY FAMILIAR THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A REDUCTION OF A BILL FROM LAST YEAR THAT WILL ACQUIRE PUBLIC AGENCIES TO RETAIN PUBLIC RECORDS TRANSMITTED BY EMAIL FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. I DECIDE TO REDUCE THIS WELL A BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLE OF TRANSPARENCY THAT ARE TRYING TO OUR STATE CONSTITUTION AND OUR PUBLIC EXISTING PUBLIC RECORD RETENTION LAWS NEED TO CONFORM WITH THE REALITIES OF TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WORK THE ONLY EMAILS THAT MY BILL IS INTERESTED IN OUR THOSE CONTAINING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CONDUCT OF THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS PREPARED OWNED USED OR RETAINED BY ANY PUBLIC AGENCY. EMAIL THAT ARE CRITICAL TO CONDUCTING THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS IT NEEDS TO BE PROPERLY- APPLY TO THEM WITHOUT THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION THERE ARE STILL ENTITIES THAT CONTINUE TO MASS DELETE EMAILS AFTER AS FEW AS THIRTY DAYS THIS DIRECTLY IMPLICATES PENDING AND FUTURE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST AS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE DISCLOSE WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DESTROYED. ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE SEEN CITIES LIKE SAN DIEGO THAT HAVE RETAIN THEIR EMAILS IS DEFINITELY SINCE TWENTY THOUSAND EIGHT THIS IS A GREAT EXPENSE TO TAXPAYERS PRESENTS DAHLE JUST TO SEE TO BELIEVE ACTUALLY COMPLY APPROPRIATELY PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. FIND AND IN INSTANCE. TENSION FOR EMAILS WOULD THE GOING OF FOR. SPAWNING TO THESE RICH. IN TWENTY TWENTY. IBM SAYING THIS EMAILS ARE EQUAL RELEVANCE TO PARA PUBLIC TO PAPER RECORDS LET ME. I KNOW THAT SET THE BALL CLAIM EARLY IN THE MORNING AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY- IN STRIDES AB TWENTY NINETY THREE ENSURES THAT PUBLIC RECORD RETENTION. REQUIREMENTS ARE PROPERLY APPLIED TO EMAILS GIVEN THEIR IMPORTANCE AND HOW THE PUBLIC AGENCIES CONDUCT THEIR WORK WE WENT WITH ME THIS MORNING IS IT- BRITNEY. BY SAUDI NOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. MARIE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRITNEY BAR SAUDI I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. AND SUPPORT OF TWENTY NINETY THREE. I WAS. ASSEMBLYMAN STATED WE ARE SEEN INSTANCES WHERE- AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE REGULARLY DELETING EMAILS. AUTOMATICALLY AND- SOME CASES AS CLOSE AS THIRTY DAYS. THESE RECORDS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE KHAM. CONDUCTING THEIR BUSINESS ESPECIALLY IN AN ERA AND TWENTY TWENTY WHERE EMAILS ARE SO REGULARLY YOU STE. AS YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT- INSURERS THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC IN THEIR PEOPLE'S BUSINESS AND IS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL BRIGHT AND NECESSARY RIGHT OF EVERY PERSON IN THIS STATE. SORRY DRY MOUTH- THE- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND. OF HEY THIS IS ALSO WHY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR RECOGNIZE THAT. PUBLIC IS THAT AMENDED THE CPR RATE TO INCLUDE EMAILS AS RATINGS AND WE'RE JUST ASKING THAT YOU- MAKE THAT THEY CONSISTENT WITH PAPER RECORDS THAT. THEY BE RETAINED FOR TWO YEARS- I RESPECTFULLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I VOTE ON THAT BEHALF OF AB TWENTY NINETY THREE. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. MORNING ONE- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DILLON GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS UP ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY NINETY THREE. I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT. OUR ASSOCIATION AND THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSING THIS LEGISLATION ALL SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN GOVERNMENT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL COULD LEAD TO THE OPPOSITE. AB TWENTY NINETY THREE DOESN'T CREATE ANY NEW RECORD. POLICIES OR DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IT SIMPLY REQUIRES PUBLIC AGENCIES TO MAINTAIN EMAILS EMAIL SENT OR RECEIVED. FOR TWO YEARS THE RESULT OF THIS- PUBLIC AGENCIES WILL HAVE THOUSANDS TO POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL EMAIL TO SORT THROUGH WHEN RESPONDING TO PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST THE DEPARTMENT O FINANCE ANALYSIS LAST YEAR THE SAME BILL LANGUAGE- STATED THE RETENTION OF NON PERTINENT EMAILS AND THE NEED TO SEARCH THROUGH THOSE EMAILS PARTICULARLY FOR LESS SPECIFIC CPR A REQUEST. INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO COMPLETE CPR A REQUEST THIS MAKES COMPLIANCE WITH THE CPR A MORE DIFFICULT IN THESE INSTANCES AND PRODUCES WORST OUTCOMES FOR PERSONS AND ENTITIES SUBMITTING THOSE REQUESTS. AND THEY WERE RIGHT. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER THE POLICIES OF THE CITY SAN DIEGO BUDGETS THIS LAST DECEMBER THE SAN DIEGO UNION TRIBUNE PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE ABOUT AN INTERNAL CITY AUDIT. LOOKING INTO THE NUMEROUS STRUGGLE TO CITIES HAVING WITH MEETING THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONDING TO CPR A REQUEST- IN THE ARTICLE THE CITY OF ATTORNEY SUGGESTS THE CITY MAY WANT TO STOP STORING EMAILS LONGER THAN REQUIRED BY. RECORDS RETENTION POLICIES WHICH COULD RID STORAGE AND SEARCH COST AND MAKE IT YOUR TOO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY SEARCH FOR SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS DUE TO THE MASSIVE VOLUME OF DOCTOR RESPONSIVE EMAILS. THE OBAMAS THROUGH WHEN RESPONDING TO REQUESTS. THIS BILL TO TAKE A THING LOW. BY STATE BY. NOTHING IS CHANGING THIS BILLS IT WAS BE BY THE GUY JUST FOR MONTHS A THE OPPOSITE WAS NOT CAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE IT WAS VETOED AND TELL WE RECEIVED IN THE MAIL LETTING US KNOW THAT THE BILL WAS REINTRODUCED. MOST OF YOU OF THE SUPPORTED THIS BILL LAST YEAR- IN SINCE THAT TIME. THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL. WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE COST OF THE BILL WILL BE IN THE MILLIONS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND EVEN MORE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE LEARNED THAT IT WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABILITY FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY RESPOND TO CPR A REQUEST. THE POLICIES FAILING WHERE IT IS CURRENTLY. BEING IMPLEMENTED. AND OVER ONE HUNDRED PUBLIC AGENCIES FROM ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SUBMITTED LETTERS OF OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND TWENTY TWENTY. I'M HOPING WITH THIS NEW INFORMATION THAT YOU WILL RECONSIDER YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL. THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOU KNOW VOTE ON AB TWENTY NINETY THREE. THANK YOU LEXUS WITH SAID MORNING SERRA BUT JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY NINETY THREE. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT DRIVE COSTS RELATING TO THE SPELLS SUCH AS IT INFRASTRUCTURE THE NUMBER OF P. R. EIGHT REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECEIVE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND STAFFING BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD RE DIRECTLY EMITTED STAFF TIME AND SCHOOL RESOURCES AWAY FROM OUR STUDENTS. AND CREATE A BACKLOG TO ME PR A REQUEST IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE BILL IS TO BROADEN ITS EMAIL RETENTION REQUIREMENTS WHICH WOULD FURTHER EXASPERATED SCHOOL DISTRICTS CURRENT FINANCIAL. BURDENS AS WE CURRENTLY RANKED THIRTY NINTH IN THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE SPENDING AND FORTY SEVENTH IN THE NATION IN THE NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATORS. ABOUT REGIONS AND MANY DEPEND ON YOUR RATE AND THE CALIFORNIA TO HELP TELECOM CONNECT FUND PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE DISCOUNTS TO SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES. TO ACCESS BROADBAND AND IT SERVICES. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA CONSIDER REQUIRING ALL PUBLIC AGENCIES A POLICY ON EMAIL RETENTION WITH GUIDANCE AND TRAINING TO STOP ON THE PROTOCOLS TO RETAIN OUR CONTACT AND DISPOSE OF EMAILS. WHICH PROVIDES EACH PUBLIC AGENCY'S BOARD AND IT'S- CONSTITUENTS. AND PERTINENT TO DISCUSS THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH OF TIME BEYOND CURRENT LAW AND REGULATIONS TO MAINTAIN EAGLES ACOSTA ASSOCIATED FOR PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY. ALL THE CLEAR. REGARDLESS THAT PRETEND TO REQUIRE. AND OTHER ELECTRONIC AND- PERTAIN TO LEAVE. OUR AUDITS ARC THAT ARE EXPECTED TO MORE HERE UP FROM ALL TAKE YOUR MUST RETAIN BE ON THE LITIGATION OR AUDIT UNTIL IT IS COMPLETED MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE SUCH POLICIES IN PLACE WE CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE TYPE OF RECORD AND DURATION OF RETENTION POLICIES BASED ON CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS TITLE FIVE SUB CHAPTER TWO BEGINNING WITH SECTION SIXTEEN- TWENTY HOWEVER AB TWENTY NINE NINETY THREE WOULD CREATE AN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT AT THIS TIME WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD WITH OUR CURRENT FINANCE SYSTEM. FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE AB TWENTY NINETY THREE THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. TO COME FOR THE MICROPHONE GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION GOOD MORNING- JASON BRIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DOWNTOWN ASSOCIATION WERE OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AT THREE MILLION ON BEHALF MESA WATER DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING BATH A LOSS ON THE OF VALLEY DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. JEFF NEAL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION. IN WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ALSO IN OPPOSITION. MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS CHORUS ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING BE CHEN MERRY ON BEHALF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES ALSO IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS ENJOY RIVERA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IT NOT IN OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR OBERNOLTE. A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MR GLORIA I KNOW YOU HAVE- EXPERIENCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS MOST OF US DO. YOU HAD MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT- THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ALREADY ENFORCESA POLICY SIMILAR TO THIS ONE AND THAT THE TIME AND EXPENSE THAT WAS- INVOLVED IN THAT AND I KNOW THAT THE- OPPOSITION ALSO RAISE THAT POINT WITH THIS MAKE THINGS LESS EXPENSIVE FOR SAN DIEGO- NO I'M NOT. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH EXACTLY WHAT THE POLICY IS. WELL IT MEETS POSSIBLE RIGHT IN THE CITY HAS AN INDEFINITE DETENTION POLICY CURRENTLY THIS. PAUL THE BILL BEFORE YOU SET IT AT TWO YEARS. OF WHERE WOULD ACTUALLY PROBABLY SAVE MONEY IT WOULD BE A BETTER LOCAL EXAMPLE WOULD BE A SANTA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- THEY'RE LOOSE RETENTION POLICY ACTUAL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT A COSTLY LITIGATION- THAT. SUBSEQUENTLY TOOK MONEY FROM OUR CLASSROOMS- SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE SAVINGS IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING CLEAR GUIDANCE THE RETENTION OF THESE EMAILS. REDUCING THE NEED FOR LITIGATION BY THOSE SEEKING THEIR RIGHT THE CONSTITUTION TO INFORMATION. TO THE GENERAL THIS WOULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN MORE EXPENSIVE. WHAT FOR SOME I MEAN FOR SOME THAT TO HAVE AND INDEFINITE POLICIES ANY THAT'S PUT IT PLATE. PROBABLY PRETTY OBVIOUS. I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT PROVIDING IT'S CLEAR THAT A DIRECTION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. A COULD MITIGATE LITIGATION- STORAGE COSTS YOU KNOW AT THAT COMES UP OFTEN- OF THERE IS THE ARGUMENT ALREADY THAT THESE ARE OF ATTAINABLE UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. LAW HOWEVER A MOST MANY OF THEM ARE BEING DELETED AFTER THIRTY DAYS- SO. YOU KNOW. I WILL LET YOU WAY FOR YOURSELF- THE MATHEMATICS OF THIS- BUT I THINK THE COSTS- THE CONCERNS ABOUT COSTS ARE OFTEN OVER EXAGGERATED. ON YOU CAN SEE THAT I KNOW YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY QUITE WELL. THE COST OF THE DATA STORAGE HAS GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS. I AGREE WITH YOU I MEAN THE- DATA STORAGE IS NOT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THE COST IS STORED TO SENSUALLY ZERO. BUT YOU KNOW AND I THINK WE'RE UNIFIED IN OUR DESIRE TO BE- OR TRANCE. WITH A POP AT ALL. GOV BUT- THE PROBLEM I THINK IS THAT THE IF YOU ARE A IS BROKEN. WITH HER. TO DO RECORDS AND MORE AND OF OUR RED ARE DID YOU INCLUDING. EMAIL FOR. SO HERE IT'S NOT TO. EXPAND ON THIS IT'S BROKE I MEAN IF THAT WILL A CITIZEN SOME A UNDER THE CPR A FOR RECORDS THE FACT THAT A HUMAN IS COMBING THROUGH DIGITAL RECORDS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S RELEVANT TO THAT REQUEST IS RIDICULOUS THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE DONE- SOMEHOW WE NEED TO AS A SOCIETY GET TO A POINT WHERE. ALL OF THAT INFORMATION THAT'S TAG IS A PUBLIC RECORD IS AUTOMATICALLY EXPOSED TO THE PUBLIC ND THEN ANYONE ANY INTERESTED PARTY THE PUBLIC CAN GO COMB THROUGH THOSE RECORDS TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RELEVANT TO WHAT THEY'RE INVESTIGATING WHAT'S NOT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT DOES IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE ALL OF THOSE RECORDS ARE EXPOSED TO THE PUBLIC IN THE PUBLIC DOES SO I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE IN THE STRANGE IN BETWEEN PLACE. WITH RESPECT TO EMAIL UNFORTUNATELY THE THIS BILL AND THE COUPLE THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD IN YEARS BEFORE THIS YOU KNOW TAKE THAT ARE TRYING TO A STEP TOWARDS GREATER TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT FIXING THE GREATER UNDERLYING PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE COMING THROUGH ALL THESE RECORDS SO UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS AGAIN I DID NOT SUPPORT LAST YEAR YEAH. IT AND OUT OF THE OF RELUCTANCE TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT THE PUBLIC BUT AT A DOLLARS MEANT THAT WE NEED TO HOLISTICALLY FIX THE CPR A AS RESPECT DIGITAL RECORDS RETENTION- AND THEN THIS PROBLEM WILL JUST GO AWAY SAW- BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE COMMITTED AS I AM FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY I WE JUST DISAGREE ON HOW TO GET THERE. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY. CREDIT AS THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THAT POINT SO IT IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MAIN COST BURDEN IS NOT IN DATA STORAGE COSTS BUT IN THE SEARCH COSTS FOR TRIPLE. IS IT YET UGH THERE THERE WILL BE STORAGE COSTS THOUGH IT IN COMPARISON TO WHAT THE OVERALL COST OF THE BILL IT'S GOING TO BE- MORE FOR THE ALL THE ATTORNEYS THAT ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE HIRED. TO COME THROUGH THE TWO YEARS WORTH OF EMAILS FOR EACH AND EVERY REQUESTS WE RECEIVE. WE RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF REQUESTS RIGHT NOW ASKING FOR- INFORMATION WE GO THROUGH YOU KNOW THE RECORDS THAT WE HAVE- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO RECEIVE IS PR A REQUEST ASKING FOR. ALL THE INFORMATION FROM EMAILS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY GO THROUGH EACH AND EVERYONE OF THOSE EMAILS TO ENSURE. THAT THE INFORMATION OF ABOUT PRIVATE CITIZENS IS REMOVED REDACTED THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND IT IS GOING TO HAVE WHETHER THIS IS A SMALL- AGENCY SMALL DISTRICT OR IT'S A EXTREMELY LARGE ONE THE LARGER THEY ARE THE MORE EMAILS ARE GOING TO HAVE. THE WAR CHINESE ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED TO GO THROUGH IN EACH EACH ONE TO ENSURE THE WHAT WE'RE RELEASING. IS SAFE. THE IS IT DOESN'T. PUT CITIZENS OR EMPLOYEES AT RISK. AND SO THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COST WITH JUST GOING THROUGH THOSE EMAILS. AND FOR US WE HAVE STUDENT AS WELL AS EMPLOYER RECORDS THAT WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT VIOLATING. ABOUT WERE FOR PAUL LOSS SAID THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH US THAT HALF OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SMALLS- HALF OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND THEN THAT MEANS. THAT'S THE SCOPE HOW MANY STAFF WE GOT A WE HAVE WITH THEM. IN TRYING TO ASSESS HOW DO WE DETERMINED AND HOW DO WE MEET THE REQUIRED THE REQUEST THAT COME IN WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN REQUESTS COMING IN BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES UNDER LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. PEOPLE ARE INTRIGUED AWARE SCHOOLS ARE NOW. RE DIRECTING RESOURCES SO WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER OF PR RABOR CLASS. INCREASE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND YET OUR TECHNOLOGY HASN'T KEPT UP. BECAUSE MANY OF OUR RULES SITES DON'T HAVE STRONG CONNECTIVITY SO WE'RE STILL BUILDING OUT WE'RE STILL UNFORTUNATELY LIVING IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE ADMINISTERED EDUCATION IN THE STATE. SO IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT SOME VERSION THAT ANALYSIS HAS TO BE DONE EVEN WITHOUT THIS BILL IT'S JUST. LIKE WHO MAKES THE DECISION WHETHER OR NOT RETAIN RIGHT NOW IS THAT DONE BY THE INDIVIDUAL. I EMPLOYEE OR IS IT DONE MORE HOLISTICALLY. IT'S DUE WITH SO WE'RE PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT IS A- A RECORD WHAT IS A DOCUMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP SO. USUALLY WHAT IT IS THE ATTACHMENT THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EMAIL. THAT IS THE DOCUMENT THAT IS THE RECORD THAT IT THAT IS CAPPED- THE- THINGS LIKE OUT OF OFFICE EMAILS THERE'S- CAKE IN THE BREAK ROOM THOSE KIND OF THINGS ARE ARE TYPICALLY DELETED. UNDER THIS LEGISLATION WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE KEEPING. EVERYTHING WITH IN DISCUSSING THE SORRY NOT GENERAL BUT AS WE SAID THEY ARE DELETED WHO DELETES THEM LIKE WHERE IS THAT ARE THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE BUT- OFTENTIMES WHAT THOSE DUES THE QUOTE DOES GO BACK ON TWO SEPARATE SERVERS SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY. GONE THEY THE- SO EXAMPLE FOR DISTRICT. I'M HERE THE- IF ONE OF YOUR- WERE. ANY IN THE- IT'S- ON THE LEAD. SERVER AND THE LEGISLATURE. GO THROUGH IN THE LEADS THOSE THINGS SO THEY'RE NOT. REALLY GONNA IN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES TO LEADING THEM BUT THEY'RE PROVIDED CERTAIN GUIDANCE ON. THESE RECORDS THESE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDING TO THE PUBLIC THAT HAVE. A POLICY THAT HAVE A- AN ACT THAT WE ARE WORKING ON OR PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE PUBLIC THOSE ARE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ALL CAP. BUT INSIGNIFICANT EMAILS AND THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED ABLE UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. THOSE KIND OF THINGS ARE DELETED. AFTER AFTER WHATEVER THAT IS THE POLICY THAT THAT- AGENCY HAS ESTABLISHED. AND OUR SCHOOLS AS I MENTIONED WE HAD WE FOLLOW REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE FOUR CLASSIFICATIONS ON HOW WE RETAIN INFORMATION SO WE TRAIN OUR STAFF. IN TERMS OF ITS PERMANENT RECORDS. EXAMPLES ARE PERSONAL RECORDS PAYROLL AND SCHOOL BOARD MINUTES IS A CLASSIFIED AS OPTIONAL RECORDS THESE CAN BE SOMETHING THAT OCCURS. IN TERMS OF A TIME LINE OF- AT DEAD DISCUSSION YOU KNOW THAT'S WORTH THE OF TEMPORARY PERSPIRATION BETWEEN THE SUPERINTENDENT AND IT DOES IT MEAN. AND SO WE WERE TAKING THEM FOR AN- FOR A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME BEFORE THEY'RE JUST STORY AND THEN WE HAVE THE DISPOSABLE RECORDS WITH WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED. THAT THERE OPTIONAL THAT THE CAMPUS DESTROYED WITHIN A- AFTER THE THIRD. JULY ONE PERSON US EXCEEDING THE COMPLETION OF ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENT WE'RE NOT ASKING THAT EMAIL TO YOUR SECOND. EMAIL PANOPLY OF I DON'T KNOW THAT I GOT MY QUESTION PRESS WE HAVE I'M CLASSIFIED UNDER SCHOOLS BY CATEGORIES SO I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOT ALL PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE THE SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS IN PLACE RIGHT. POINT POINT AS THE I GUESS IS MY QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE HAVING TO DO THAT ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW AND CITING WHAT TO. DELETE IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR EXISTING POLICIES. WHY IS THAT PROCESS NECESSARILY LESS BURDENSOME AND THE PROCESS YOU FEAR WOULD TAKE PLACE IN A MISTER GLORIA'S BELLER HAVING TO DO THAT ANALYSIS IN RESPONSE. ALRIGHT REQUESTS WE THINK IT JUST EXPANDS THE SCOPE BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BROAD BILL AT THIS POINT. WOULD MEAN WHEN WE'RE WEBER AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO BE KEEPING EVERY EMAIL IT'S ABOUT THE RESPONSE. TO THE C. P. R. A. RICK US IT'S- IN THE STORE IS A- LOW THE COST RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST WILL BE IN THE FUTURE WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT MICROSOFT- IS GOING TO CHARGE US AND- PERHAPS ONCE THEY SEE THAT WE HAVE BY LAW. TO RETAIN AND MAINTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STORAGE THEY MAY CHANGE THEIR PRICING. OF THE AND THAT THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ANALYSIS- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'LL SEE OF THIS BILL LAST THE WHILE COSTS. FOR STORAGE MAY BE LOW NOW WE CAN'T PREDICT. WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE. I THANK YOU MENTION. THANK YOU ARE AM THIS WAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT. A LOT OF OUR BILLS ON A LOT OF THE CURRENT LAN TRANSPARENCY RELATES TO WHEN WE WERE STRICTLY A PAPER. SOCIETY AND WHEN WE RECEIVE LETTERS FROM CONSTITUENTS- AND WHEN A MEMOS WENT BACK AND FORTH IN INTER OFFICE MAIL WENT BACK AND FORTH IN THOSE FOLDERS THAT YOU BUT HERE THAT'S NOT THE CASE NOW AND SO YOU'RE LEGISLATION ATTEMPTING TO DEAL WITH THIS TRANSFORMATION AND HOW GOVERNMENT DEALS WITH THE PUBLIC I THINK IS IMPORTANT- ALSO TO IN TERMS OF STORAGE CROSS EYED. I DO THINK THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO- PUT IN A POTENTIALLY LEAD TO MORE COSTS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT I THINK BY AND LARGE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT STORAGE COSTS ARE ON. A MICROSOFT AGO EVEN IPHONE OF THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FOR EXAMPLE USED APPLE THIS ABLE TO STORE FOR NINETY NINE CENTS A MONTH FOR INDIVIDUALS FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW THE COST IS PROBABLY AN EQUITABLE IN ADDITION- IN TERMS OF WHAT IT IS THIS NOTION OF THAT THERE IS SOME CONFUSION THERE COULD BE SOME CONFUSION AS WHAT. WHAT IS TO BE SAFE OR NOT THAT'S THAT COULD HAPPEN NOW I MEAN THAT YOUR BILL DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT. IS BUT- WHAT IS DISCOVERABLE ON UNDER A PUBLIC RECORDS. REQUEST IF SOMEBODY'S TALKING ABOUT GOING TO LUNCH THAT WAS NEVER DISCOVERABLE THAT'S NOT RELEVANT TO THE PUBLIC BUSINESS- SPAM EMAILS SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT UP WEREN'T RELEVANT BEFORE THEY'RE NOT RELEVANT NOW- IT IT. AND JUST A CURIOSITY ACTUALLY ONE THING ABOUT IT TOO WE'RE DISCUSSING IT. WITH ME BECAUSE ON A WHY TO WHAT AT WHAT CAME THE TWO YEAR ISSUE HOW DO YOU DECIDE ON THAT WHAT WAS WE WERE. YOU TRYING TO ESTABLISH YOU KNOW DOT THAT THAT THAT THE TO MINIMUM OF THIRTY DAYS TO THIS INDEFINITE. YOU KNOW IT'S FAIRLY ARBITRARY I'D BE WILLING TO WORK WITH FOLKS IF THEY FEEL LIKE THAT'S TOO MUCH- THERE WAS A TIME IN MY LIFE I PROPOSE ONE YEAR AND THAT WAS NOT WELL RECEIVED- BY MANY TRANSPARENCY EXPERTS SO WE LANDED IT TO- IF FOLKS HAVE A GENIUS IDEA MISTRAL NOT HE'S GOT NEVADA AND HIS MIND OF WHAT. OF OPEN GOVERNMENT LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE EIGHT A MAULERS BUT A BUT HONESTLY THAT WAS WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A HAPPY MEDIUM OF GOLDILOCKS OPTION IF YOU WILL BETWEEN THE TWO THE TWO SHORT AND THE TOO LONG. AN EXTRA THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I THINK TOO THAT THIS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GOES TO THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT. AND SO EVEN IF THERE ARE SOME INCIDENTAL COSTS THAT GO WITH THAT I THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT COSTS THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE TO. KEEP THESE DOCUMENTS AT A TIME WHEN- BUT THE WAY THE PUBLIC INTERACTS WITH GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED OR IS CHANGING. SO I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY MYSTICAL I AM PLEASED THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR SAN DIEGO IN TERMS OF. PARENTS FOR THE STATE AS A WHOLE. THANK YOU MISTER HOLDEN. YOU MISTER. MISTER GLORIA I'D- SIT. YOUR BILL LAST TIME AND I WILL FOR AGAIN. BUT I WILL SAY THAT. IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE WHEN YOU BRING A BILL BACK THE SECOND TIME AND THE GOVERNOR'S REALLY WAIT AND NOW AND KNOWS. YOU HAVE YOU HAVE CLARITY IN TERMS OF WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SEE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION SO. UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS BILL IS ON ITS WAY WOULD BE ASSUMING IT HAS THE VOTES TO APPROPRIATIONS IT PROBABLY WOULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO RECONVENE WITH THE OPPOSITION AND ALSO. TRY TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHT ON WHAT. MIGHT BE DONE TO YOUR BILL- IT IT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THANK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE HOW YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT. BUT I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE. THE HOLD ON A SECOND FOR ABOUT THE. THE GOVERNOR'S AGREEING WITH IT OFF FOR YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DID YOU KNOW THAT IS SEVEN YEARS THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED I'M NOT SURE WHERE TODAY- BUT ALL ARE REALLY SAYING IS THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW KIND OF GET A FIX ON WHAT WILL BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO YOUR BILL SUCCESSFULLY FORCE ADDRESS THIS TIME AROUND SO. COST SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE TO SOME DEGREE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HONE IN ON HOW YOU CAN. YOU KNOW SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND- I THINK THAT- YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT. A TO MOVE OUT MOVE ALONG TO ALLOW YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THERE SO. ALTHOUGH THE BILL. FIGURES FOR THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND THERE'S A SECOND. MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU. AT AT I THINK OKAY SORRY THE US. I'M SO FIRST OF ALL I SEE YOU RE ENTRY WE I KNOW WE MADE CHANGES LAST YEAR AND APPROPRIATIONS AND I APPRECIATE YOU INTRODUCING IT AS SUCH. I WANT TO ASK AGAIN I MEAN NOT A FLIP THAT WAY ABOUT THE TWO YEARS. I AND I UNDERSTAND HAVING. YOU PROPOSAL. OF CLIPS. BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN A REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT AN APPROPRIATE TIME. WOULD OR SHOULD LOOK LIKE. AND I'M SORRY FOR MY IGNORANCE BUT WHEN IT WAS PAPER WHAT IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR. TWO YEARS TWO YEARS OKAY SO THAT'S- WHAT THE THAT'S THE MORNING. THIS IS EXACTLY THE ISSUE OF GETTING TO BUY IS THAT YOU HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT FOR EXISTING IT WILL HIS STARK DOCUMENTS- EQUALIZING THAT- WITH THIS AGAIN IS A DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE FAR FAR LOWER OR IN SOME CASES FAR HIGHER REQUIREMENTS OF PROVIDING THIS GUIDANCE IN THE STATE. OF WHAT THIS COULD BE FINDING IT AS SUCH AS MR MAJOR TALK ABOUT WITH HOW WE COMMUNICATE TODAY AS WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST THAT'S WERE COMING FROM. AGAIN IF CALL IS TRULY THE CONCERN THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY TALK ABOUT THAT FURTHER- BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE DIGITAL CONVERSATION OF THE GOVERNOR ON WHAT'S NECESSARY AND I THINK THE OPPONENT TO HEAR TODAY NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE ELECTRNIC COMMUNICATION IS HOW WE COMMUNICATE TODAY AND SO A BILL WILL PASS. QUESTION IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE THIS EASIER ON THEM RIGHT- SO ON THE TEARS I'M SORRY JUST YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THE HISTORICAL WHAT. WHITE YOU DON'T KNOW WHY THAT WAY BETTER THAN THE COMPETITION IS HAVE HIT A ROOM. LIKE THIS AND- YEAH I AM. YOU KNOW WE- I THINK WE BOUNCE HISTORY. A LOT IN A PRESS. LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE RELATION TO COST AND- OF COURSE. AS THINGS CHANGE WRITTEN DOCUMENTS THAT WE KEPT WERE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN. MASSIVE THE EMAILS IT'S EIGHTY ONE GOT A LAUNCHER YOU KNOW THE CHAIN OF EMAILS THAT. COULD OR COULD NOT BE. RELATED TO THE ACTUAL. DISCOVERABLE DOCUMENT- IF YOU. BY CHANCE IN AND MOVING TO APPROPRIATIONS COULD. A NURSE ANY OF THAT I MEAN WE CAN DO THAT WORK I'M JUST VERY CURIOUS I ON HOW WE GOT TO TWO. IS THAT THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER- ESPECIALLY. IN AN EMAIL FORM WHERE SO MUCH MORE IS BEING RETAINED OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN RETAINED RENT DOCUMENTS I. AND I'M I'M- FOR TRANSPARENCY YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S GOOD I. YOU KNOW ALMOST WAS CONVINCED MAYBE SHOULD BE LONGER THAN TWO YEARS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COST A LOT TO STORE BUT WE WANTED TO BE MANAGEABLE AS WELL AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THOSE. REYES FOR POLITICAL REASONS THAT THAT ARE MASSIVE AND YOU KNOW REALLY HAVE NO. DESIRE BUT TO FIND SOME GOTCHA DOCUMENT- OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT IS EVERYBODY'S RIGHT TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT BUT I'D LOVE TO REALLY NOBLE STAND MORE HOW WE GOT TO TWO YEARS WHY THAT'S IN A PART NUMBER AND IF THAT SHOULD BE A APPROPRIATE. ARE MOVING FORWARD SCRIPTED THAT THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA ARE IT AND ACTUALLY THINK THIS DISCUSSION POINTS OUT WHY SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THE TWO YEARS I'M NOT SURE IN THE HISTORY OF THE TWO YEARS AROUND DOCUMENT RETENTION. PROBABLY WASN'T CHASING AT SOME POINT. THAT RECORDS ARE HELD LONG ENOUGH FOR AN ISSUE TO BE DISCOVERED AND THEN. AND THEN B. B. SOCK DOCUMENTS GET SOUGHT. BUT SOME OF THE COMMENTS WILL FIRST OF ALL THE STORAGE COSTS QUESTION TO ME IS. SPEECHES I MEAN THAT'S RIDICULOUS IT'S NOT GOING TO GO UP IT'S DOING NOTHING BUT GOING DOWN YOU CAN BY. NOW BY FOR PRETTY DARN CHEAP. BUT THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY CAN SIT HERE GLIBLY SAY WELL WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STORE ALL OF THESE USELESS EMAILS. HOW DO WE KNOW THEY'RE USELESS BUT WE HAVEN'T SET A STANDARD AND YES ATTACHMENTS CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT. MAYBE WEEK WE CAN DRAW SOME DISTINCTION THERE BUT OFTEN TIMES THERE IS INFORMATION THERE ARE ADMISSIONS THERE ARE THINGS IN THE BODY OF AN EMAIL THAT CAN BE VERY SIGNIFICANT TO LINE OF INQUIRY AND VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO SAY. THAT'S NOT PROBATIVE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE SOUGHT- FRANKLY SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC AGENCIES. IF PEOPLE ARE USING THEIR PUBLIC AGENCY EMAIL TO SET UP LUNCH STATES ROBERT WE NOT AN APPROPRIATE USE OF A STATE RESOURCE. I KNOW THAT HAPPENS. BUT THESE. THERE PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE SOME. DISCIPLINE AROUND HOW EMAILS GET USE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT IS THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION THAT I DO UNDERSTAND I HAVE BEEN BEAT UP LOCALLY OVER THIS BILL LAST YEAR. THAT POTENTIAL COST. THEY ARE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY BEING HELD ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S COMPUTER BECAUSE THAT INDIVIDUAL MIGHT BE CALLING THROUGH THOSE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE AGENCY'S STANDARDS ARE BUT THEY DO EXIST EITHER IN AN ARCHIVE OR ON AND AGENCIES SERVER THE FACT THAT IT'S ON A SERVER ALSO MAKES IT MORE INHERENTLY SEARCHABLE NOW I DON'T KNOW MISERABLE NOLTE FOR RIGHT. FOR THE DAY WHEN EVERYTHING THAT WE GENERATE BUT BY EMAIL ALL THESE COMMUNICATIONS ARE AUTOMATICALLY THEN SENT UP AND SEARCHABLE BY EVERYONE- WE YOU CAN YEAH- THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THAT'S A THAT'S A SEPARATE DISCUSSION ABOUT. THAT REALLY THAT THE OPENNESS AT SOME POINTS. I DON'T DISAGREE WE MAY BE THERE OR SOMEWHERE LIKE IT BUT I THINK WE AS A SOCIETY ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH WHAT. THE DIGITAL WORLD LOOKS LIKE AND MEANS AND IN THE MEANTIME. FOR US TO HAVE SUCH A VARIETY OF POLICIES AT DIFFERENT AGENCIES SOME SECIFICS I'M NOT SOME AND KNOWING SOME KIND OF A KNOWING. THEN SORT OF OBVIOUS GETS THE REAL VALUE OF WHAT SOME OF THESE DOCUMENTS ARE AND IDO UNDERSTAND THE COST INFORMATION AND MISS GONZALEZ I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE WORRYING ABOUT THAT BUT IF THE REASON FOR US TO SAY WE ARE NOT. GOING TO BE TRANSPARENT IS BECAUSE OF COSTS WILL THAT SHIP SAILED. DECADES AGO AS SOON AS WE STARTED DOWN THAT THE PATH OF PUBLIC RECORDS OF PUBLIC DISCO DISCLOSURES. SO I'M NOT SURE HOW WE SOLVE THAT. OR IF IT'S REALLY SOLVABLE BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION YES THERE'S A LOT OF CHAFF. BUT THERE'S ALSO INFORMATION THAT IS VALUABLE TO WHATEVER PUBLIC INQUIRIES COULD BE THAT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SHY. AWAY FROM THAT SIDE I THINK THAT FROM THIS COMMITTEE STANDPOINT THE FACT OF THE- GOVERNOR VETOED IT. MISTER GLORIA GOOD LUCK WITH THE GOVERNOR ON THAT THAT'S BEYOND WHAT THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO LOOK AT. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE POLICY WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE I AM VERY SENSITIVE THE COST ISSUES HERE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO. IN THIS-SITUATION OTHER THAN TRIED SET SOME CLEAR STANDARDS AND MOVE FORWARD. AND THIS OBERNOLTE MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE IN CONGRESS YOU CAN PROPOSE SOMETHING THAT OPENS UP. ALL PUBLIC. INTERACTIONS TO BE AUTOMATICALLY PUBLIC BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME BOOKS ON. THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH THAT IN MIND. ANYWAY SO I THINK THIS MEETS OUR STANDARD IS FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AS IT DID LAST YEAR. SHE IS WITH THE GOVERNOR AND OTHERS AND IF THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO DEFINE OR TO MANAGE COSTS I WOULD HOPE THAT WE LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I THINK FOR ALL OF US. THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE A SERIOUS ISSUE BUT UNDERLYING. THIS IS THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE. SEND PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IS REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT SO GLORIA MAY CLOSE. THE CHAIRMAN AS USUAL YOUR SPOT ON I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS FOR THE RECORD. I'LL BE CLEAR THAT I WILL WORK WITH ANY THE STAKEHOLDERS AFFECTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE END UP WITH A REASONABLE RESPONSIBLE POLICY. LIKE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D JERRY CONCERNED ABOUT COST ANY OF YOU KNOW ME KNOWING I'D CHEAP AS ALL GET OUT SO LISTEN. I WILL WORK WITH PEOPLE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE COSTS ARE CONTAINED. BUT I WANT TO MAKE pWERE TALKING TO THE TRUE COSTS. WHETHER THAT IS THE UNLIMITED ATTENTION BY CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THOSE COSTS OR THE REAL COST OF LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEADING RECORDS- BY JURISDICTIONS AND BETTER LATER. SOMEHOW DISCOVERED WE KNOW THAT THEIR ACOSTA SO DO SUCCEED WITH OUR CURRENT APPROACH THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THAT- AND- LASTLY I WANT TO SAY IS SOMEONE WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT IT ABOUT PRIVACY ISSUES. IN NO WAY WILL BE DISCLOSING PEOPLES- ALREADY- PROHIBITED A PERSONAL INFORMATION THEY'RE ALREADY PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW THIS BILL NO WAY EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF WHAT'S DISCOVERABLE UNDER. PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WHAT IT EXPANDS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT A RECORD THAT IS DISCOVERABLE BY THE PUBLIC ENTITLED TO THEM BY OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. IS NOT THE LEAD ON THE THIRTY FIRST DAY SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME OF OUR ALGORITHM TO DID AUTOMATICALLY AND NO ONE NO HUMAN BEING BOTHERED TO LOOK AT IT TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS DONE. SO THIS IS A VOTE FOR TRANSPARENCY AND I RECOGNIZE WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO WITH THE GOVERNOR. FOR DOING NETWORK BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S TWENTY TWENTY ALL. THE PAYMENTS RETAIN. BEERS IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME WE MADE UP WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER AND MISSED CHAIR THE CHAMBER APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I WILL DO THAT HOMEWORK TO MAKE SURE WE SHOP AT YOUR COMMITTEE APPROPRIATELY. A RESOURCE BUT AGAIN THE DOORS OPEN WILL WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THOSE KIND WORDS YOU ARE AGAIN AS USUAL SPOT ON I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR OUTLOOK.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURRS I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIFTY THREE. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTED AFTER TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO INSTALL FIRST AID KITS THAT WILL GROW TOURNIQUETS. A COMPRESS OF DEVICE THAT STOPS THE FLOW OF BLOOD THROUGH A VEIN ARTERY OR LAMB. SOMEWHERE TO HOW AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS WERE INTRODUCED TO PUBLIC SETTINGS. THESE FIRST AID KITS WILL BE A SUPPLEMENTAL TOOL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. A PERSON BEING CONDUCT FROM BLOOD LOSS WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OR LESS IT IS IMPERATIVE TO THAT THOSE NEAREST TO SOMEONE WITH LIFE THREATENING INJURIES OUR BEST POSITION TO PROVIDE FOR STATE CARE. WITH MASS SHOOTINGS OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY PUBLIC SETTING SUCH AS SCHOOLS CHURCHES AND LARGE GO PUBLIC EVENTS. IT IS VITAL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY THAT OFFER ST KITTS BUTTE WITH THE QUICK WIT TOURNIQUETS. I'M COMMITTED TO WORK WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS SO THAT WE MAY PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH. ACCESS TO EASY USE OF LIFE SAVING EQUIPMENT WITH ME TO THAT'S FIGHT TODAY IS CHRISTY WAS FROM THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE- SO WHEN SOMEONE'S BLEEDING EVERY SECOND COUNTS AND A TOURNIQUET CAN EMPOWER. THE LAY PERSON. TO TREAT AN INJURY UNTIL A PROFESSIONAL HELP ARRIVES. SO AS- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID WE ARE SEEING INCREASED- GUNSHOT WOUNDS AND OTHER THINGS. BUT REALLY YOU'RE MORE THAN LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER SOMEONE WITH THE EVERYDAY INJURY SOMETHING LIKE A CAR ACCIDENT A DEEP CUT. ACROSS BLOOM- OR SOME OTHER EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE AND AS HE SAID SOMEONE WHO'S WHO IS SEVERELY BLEEDING. COMPLETE TO DEATH IN AS LITTLE AS FIVE MINUTES- SO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LIKE THIS- TURNED EVERY DAY CITIZENS OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS. AND A TOURNIQUET CAN SAFELY LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD THE VICTIM. WILL LOSE BEFORE RECEIVING HOSPITAL TREATMENT- BYSTANDERS ARE OFTEN THE- ON THE SCENE OF A TRAFFIC INJURY BEFORE PROFESSIONAL RESCUERS. IN SOME CASES A BYSTANDER CARE CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER THE PATIENT SURVIVES OR NOT. SO EXPERIENCED WITH CPR IN AT T. SAYS THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT BYSTANDERS WILL ATTEMPT TO INTERVENE ESPECIALLY WHEN ACCESS TO EQUIPMENT. A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE OF PRE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE BITES THAT LAY RESPOND HERS ARE WILLING. TO APPLY SPECIALIZED DRESSINGS DESIGNED TO STOP SEVERE BLEEDING. WITH CIVILIANS PERFORM OF PRE HOSPITAL TOURNIQUET APPLICATION. THE RISK FOR DEATH WAS SIX TIMES LESS IN PATIENTS WITH BLUNT TRAUMA TO THE EXTREMITIES. SEVERAL STATES IN THE US ARE ALREADY EXACT- ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT CONSIDERS. THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF THE STOP THE BILLY PROGRAM. AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT LEAST TWELVE STATES INTRODUCED OR PASSED LEGISLATION TO INFORM EDUCATE. AND EMPOWER THEIR CITIZENS TO BECOME A- IMMEDIATE RESPOND WHO CAN SAVE THE LIFE. IN THE OF THE- OF A BILLY NUMBER SAY. IT'S A POOR TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE IN ACTION IS TAKEN BY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC BEFORE FIRST RESPONDERS ARRIVE ON THE SCENE GIVE VICTIMS A BETTER CHANCE AT RECOVERING FROM LIKE THREATENING. AND SERIOUS INJURIES FOR THIS REASON THE RED CROSS IS PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND SAVING LIVES. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. MORE MATURE MEMBERS RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION- ANY HELP WE CAN GET IN- SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES- WE APPRECIATE IT AND WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE. OR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SEE NONE AS THEIR OPPOSITION. I'D SAY NONE OF BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER BURN OFF THE- I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO- MISTER RODRIGUEZ SIDE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BILL FORWARD I HI. THE GOOD SAMARITAN LIABILITY PROTECTIONS CHIU PROPOSED IN THIS BILL I'M COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE OF I THINK THOSE ARE LONG OVERDUE- I STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR TRAUMA KITS AND THE REASON IS NOT. MY BELIEF THAT TRAUMA KIT SHOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE IN THESE LOCATIONS IT'S THE MANDATE YOU KNOW ADDING TO THE MANDATE THAT WE THAT THESE BE AVAILABLE IN ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS THAT THAT MEET THE CRITERIA THAT YOU'VE OUTLINED- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS WERE DOING IT ON THE BASIS OF STATISTICS AND SCIENTIFIC FACT RATHER THAN. YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS GOOD AND THE- PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WITH IT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS ON YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF EXPERIENCING ONE OF THESE TRAUMA RELATED INJURIES IN ONE OF THESE BUILDINGS IT'S INCREDIBLY LOW I MEAN LOWER DOWN YOUR ODDS OF GETTING OUT BY PUTTING. AND JUSTICE I'VE SEEN SO WHAT I PROPOSING THAT. YOU KNOW LIGHTNING KITS BE AVAILABLE IN ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS RIGHT AND YET THE DATA WOULD SUGGEST THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE OF A SOCIETAL BENEFIT THAN WHAT'S IN YOUR BILL SO WHAT. WE HAVE HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT BECAUSE THE STATISTICS SAY. THAT PUTTING THIS REQUIREMENT ON COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS IS NOT REASONABLE. WELL I CAN LOOK AT IT AS WHAT WE DO EIGHTY TEACH RIGHT THERE PRETTY MUCH WATCHWORD EVERYWHERE THERE ACTUALLY IN THE CAPITAL. SO I'M LOOKING AT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. THE CHALLENGES THAT WE GOT A E. DIS TO BE INSTALLED IN BUILDINGS. SUCH AS OURS. THAT THE SUGGEST A SUPPLEMENTAL- SAFETY DEVICE TO HELP FOLKS AS WE DO A DIS. I THINK IT'S VERY CHALLENGING BACK THEN AND I THINK THIS WOULD PROBABLY CALL SOME CONCERN WITH FOLKS LIKE YOURSELF AND OTHERS. THAT IT MAY NOT BE NEEDED BUT I THINK AS TIME. MOVES FORWARD AND JUST TYPES INSTANCE RECEIVED FREQUENT MARK DURING. THAT IS SOMETHING AS A JUST AN ADDITIONAL TOOL AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT A COST AS BEING OR MANDATE BECAUSE- VERY COSTS IS VERY MINIMAL I THINK OF YOU BY THESE ITS LARGE SCALE THAT. WE'RE DOING IS TRYING TO SAVE SOMEBODY'S LIFE IF WE TRYING TO. BOB POLITICIZED EVENT OR MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT'S NOT USEFUL THAN YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE SAYING TO FOLKS OUT THERE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO. HAVE SOMETHING AVAILABLE TO SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE AND IN THIS CASE IT'S A TOURNIQUET- I THINK I HELPS WHEN THEY'RE OUT THE- THE DIE START. WITH THE CHAIR FOR ANYONE TO LOOK AT IT IT'S VERY. VERY SMALL MINIMAL AND IF WE CAN PUT. HI FIRST AID KIT WITH THE TOURNIQUET SUCH AS THOSE THEIR NEXT TO AN A E. D. AS- WE DO ALREADY I MEAN AS SOME AREAS DO ALREADY. HAVE THAT I THINK. THE SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD- BECAUSE TO CONCERN BECAUSE OF COST OR OTHER THINGS OF THAT NATURE. RIGHT NOW IT'S MORE THE MANDATE. BECAUSE AS I SAID BEFORE GONNA PUT A MANDATE ON PEOPLE LET'S MAKE SURE THE MANDATE MAKES SENSE. AND TO YOUR POINT ABOUT EIGHTY D. IS. THE ODDS OF. SOMEONE NEEDING ACCESS TO DEVELOP GREATER. IN A COMMERCIAL BUILDING. YOU KNOW OUR- UP SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN ANYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND- SO. YOU KNOW IT'S- I THINK WHEN YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET STRUCK BY LIGHTNING THEN. TO NEED A TRAUMA KIT YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S COMPELLING SO BEING RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION AS I WAS LAST YEAR BUT- I RECOGNIZE THE GOOD INTENTIONS BY THE BILL AND AS I SAID. I WISH THAT THE STOOD SOMERTON PIECE OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SEPARATED OUT BECAUSE I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. AMOUNT THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MR HOLDEN. I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHEN AS WERE JUST DESCRIBING YOU DON'T NEED AN INTO YOU NEEDED SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE IT ACCESSIBLE. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WITH THE FIGURE LATER THERE'S INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE IT. THERE'S ITS CLARITY IN TERMS OF HOW OF TO ACTIVATE AND TO APPLY. IN THE CASE OF THE TURN TOURNIQUET ARE THERE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW A PERSON WOULD BECAUSE I WOULD ASSUME IF YOU DON'T DO IT RIGHT THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE WORSE THAN. THE NOT DOING IT AT ALL. YES SOME OF THEM ALREADY HAVE THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THERE BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE LATE PERSONS IT'S A ARE THE ONES THAT WILL BE USING IT I MEAN. IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THESE AND SISTERS ALWAYS SOMEBODY THAT'S OFF DUTY WHETHER IT'S A PEACE OFFICER FIREFIGHTER MEDIC THAT SEEMS TO BE THE FIRST ONES OUT THERE TO HELP- IN WHICH IN MANY CASES WERE. PEOPLE HAVE USED BELTS OR SHIRTS. AS IN PLACE OF A TOURNIQUET BECAUSE- YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO STOP BLOOD I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE MORE OF A SAFETY ISSUE MORE THAN. SOMETHING TO MAKE SOMEBODY WORSE- AS YOU SEE THOSE I THINK THEY THEY MAY HAVE A SMALL- DESTRUCTION MANUAL WITH THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY EASY SIMPLE TO USE. AND I'M NOT MANDATING EVERYBODY KNOW HOW TO USE THEM RIGHT AS YOU DO A EDIE'S BUT- AT THE VERY SIMPLE TOOL. AND I BELIEVE INSTRUCTIONS ARE REQUIRED ON ALL OF THEM THAT YOU PURCHASED NOWADAYS. HI OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SING DONE MISTER RODRIGUEZ YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECT AS FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU LOOKING FOR A MOTION EMOTIONAL BE DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE BY STONE I GALLAGHER CHOW CHOW I H. U. CHIU AYE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HOLDEN HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE NOW REYES. THAT BILLS OUT THANK YOU MISTER DAVIS. EXIST TO ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B. TWENTY FIFTY NINE THIS COLOR. MORNING MR CHAIR. I MEMBERS. I AM HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY FIFTY NINE THAT PROTECT AUG FROM UNNECESSARY TESTING ACT I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY DOGS ARE STILL BEING TESTED ON IN LABORATORIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND COMPELLED TO INTRODUCE THIS BILL WHICH WOULD END TOXICITY TESTING OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS ON DOGS. THE BILL DOES HAVE CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS WHICH I WANT TO STATE INCLUDING FOR TOXICITY TESTS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW. THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPACT MEDICAL RESEARCH FOR DRUGS VACCINES OR OTHER PRODUCTS MEANT FOR DOGS OR OTHER NON HUMAN ANIMALS AND IT DOES NOT IMPACT PESTICIDE TESTS CURRENTLY REQUIRED BY THE EPA. IT DOES NOT IMPACT MEDICAL DEVICE TESTING YET SOME COMPANIES CONDUCT TOXICITY TESTS ON DOGS THAT ARE NOT LET ME REPEAT NOT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW. EXAMPLES OF PRODUCTS AND SPECIFIC TESTS IMPACTED INCLUDE SOME PESTICIDE TESTS FOOD ADDITIVES CHEMICALS AND DRUGS INTENDED FOR HUMANS. THIS TESTING IS CONDUCTED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN PRIVATE LABS THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT WHAT TESTS THEY ARE CONDUCTING ON ANIMALS AND WHY. WHILE THIS BILL IS NARROW IN SCOPE IT WILL MATTER TO EVERY DOG SPARED FROM A LIFE ALONE IN A CAGE SUFFERING FROM NAUSEA VOMITING SEIZURES AND DEATH. DOG SUBJECTED TO TOXICITY TESTS ARE FORCED TO INGEST OR INHALE HIGH DOSES OF THE SUBSTANCE SOME ARE EVEN GIVEN INTRAVENOUSLY AND THEY ARE NEARLY ALWAYS KILLED AT THE END OF THE STUDY. THE EPA ELIMINATED THE ONE YEAR DOG TASK MORE THAN A DECADE AGO BECAUSE THE AGENCY TO TERM THAT THE TASK WAS NOT SCIENTIFICALLY NECESSARY YET COMPANIES STILL CARRY THESE TESTS OUT AND SEND RESULTS TO THE EPA FOR APPROVAL IN THIS SHOULD BE A NO NO. YOU ASKED WHAT ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY. I SAY THERE ARE SCIENTIFIC FLAWS IN TESTING ON DOGS FOR HUMANS MANY TESTS HAVE RESULTED IN FALSE NEGATIVES. THE FAILURE RATE FOR TOXICITY TESTING OF DOGS ON ANIMALS IT'S MORE THAN ON HUMANS PUTS THE HUMANS AT RISK. SO WHAT DOES THIS TELL YOU. IT SAYS THAT THESE TOXICITY TESTS DO NOT INSURE HUMAN SAFETY AND THEY TOTALLY DISREGARD CANINE LIFE. CALIFORNIA IS PROUD TO BE A LEADER IN INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY AND THE WORK OF COMPANIES HERE IN THE STATE ARE TO WHO ARE DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTING IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE. ORGAN ON A CHIP TECHNOLOGIES FOR EXAMPLE USE HUMAN CELLS AND STIMULATE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE HUMAN BODY. WE CAN ALSO USE COMPUTER MODELING TO ASSESS HISTORICAL DATA TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF A PRODUCT. THESE ALTERNATIVES ARE AVAILABLE AND CONTINUE TO BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED THE EPA HAS EMBRACED THIS APPROACH AS A WAY FORWARD AND ACTUALLY PLANS TO ELIMINATE ALL TESTING ON MAMMALS FOR PESTICIDES AND CHEMICALS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THE FDA IS ALSO WORKING ON A PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY ROAD MAP SEEKS TO REDUCE ANIMAL TESTING. NOW THESE APPROACHES IMPACT ALL ANIMALS BUT AB TWENTY FIFTY NINE IS JUST ABOUT THE DOGS. BUT WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HUMAN LIFE AND DOG LIFE PASSING AB TWENTY FIFTY NINE MEANS WE CAN SAVE CANINE LIVES AND PROTECT HUMAN SAFETY BY CARRYING OUT RELEVANT AND REQUIRED REQUIRED TOXICITY TESTING IN NEW WAYS. THAT ARE MORE RELIABLE AND SAFE FOR. NOW I WILL ALSO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH THIS BILL HAS BEEN PRINT IN PRINT FOR OVER A MONTH. CONCERNED PARTIES DID NOT SEND SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS UNTIL LAST THURSDAY AT FOUR PM. I HAVE ACCEPTED CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS AND I'M OPEN TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. THAT PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE BILL. HEY WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS VERY KIPPERMAN WITH THE HUMANE SOCIETY VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND KATHLEEN CALMLY WITH THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU SEE YOU'RE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS AS OTHERS YES MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALRIGHT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRMAN STERN VICE CHAIR GALLAGHER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIFTY NINE TO PROTECT DOGS FROM UNNECESSARY TESTING ACT. MY NAME IS KATHLEEN CONLEY I AM VICE PRESIDENT OF ANIMAL RESEARCH ISSUES FOR THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. I ACTUALLY WORKED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AT A PRIMATE BREEDING AND RESEARCH FACILITY BECAUSE I CARED ABOUT HUMAN HEALTH AND ANIMALS I LEFT THE LABORATORY FOR THOSE VERY SAME REASONS. FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND ANIMAL WELFARE CONCERNS I NOW ADVOCATE FOR TESTING AND RESEARCH THAT IS MORE HUMAN RELEVANT COST EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT AND SPARES ANIMALS FROM SUFFERING. YOU'VE HEARD HOW NARROW THIS BILL IS IT IS ABOUT TOXICITY TESTING ONLY THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF TESTING THIS IS ONLY ABOUT TOXICITY TESTING NOT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW. CARRIED OUT ON DOGS IN FRONT PRODUCTS MEANT FOR HUMANS NOT DOGS. EXAMPLES OF DRUG TESTING THOSE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL ARE CERTAIN TESTS ON PESTICIDES FOOD IN COLOR IT IS HUMAN DRUGS AND OTHERS. MOST PEOPLE AS YOU HEARD ARE SHOCKED TO HEAR THIS IS STILL HAPPENING AND TWENTY TWENTY. DOGS ARE USED TO THESE CHECKS BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN THEY'RE COMPLIANT INTERESTING ANIMALS. AND THAT MAKES IT EASY TO pINCENTIVE TO STOP. DRUG TESTING DOESN'T ENSURE HUMAN SAFETY AS YOU HEARD AND IT'S ACTUALLY HARM TO MEN'S JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE. VIOXX WHICH WAS REMOVED FROM THE GLOBAL MARKET WAS LINKED TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND HEART ATTACKS IN HUMANS SIXTY THOUSAND OF THOSE FATAL. THIS WAS AFTER SIX DIFFERENT ANIMAL STUDIES ON FOUR SPECIES INCLUDING DOGS WHICH SHOWED THAT VIDAK: WAS ACTUALLY PROTECTIVE AGAINST HEART ATTACKS WHEN ACTUALLY CAUSE HARM IN HUMANS. BILL GATES GAY RECENT REMARKS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE MEANING POINTING OUT THAT THIS IS TECHNOLOGY. HAS THE POTENTIAL THE NON ANIMAL METHODS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE YEARS OF THE TIME. IT TAKES TO EVALUATE SAFETY OF DRUGS OF THE PRACTICE AND SAY UNDER THE- DOLLARS. BE THE RESURGENT CLINICAL TRIALS SO WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE TO MOVE AWAY FROM FAILED TESTING ON DOGS. A DEMAND FOR CHANGE INCLUDING BY YOU IF YOU VOTE FOR AB TWENTY FIFTY NINE YOUR PROTECT DOGS INCREASE HUMAN SAFETY AND SPUR INNOVATION. I HOPE YOU CHOOSE TO DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US WITH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED COMMITTEE. I'M DOCTOR BERRY KIPPERMAN A CALIFORNIA LICENSED VETERINARIAN. BEEN PRACTICING FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS. I AM A BOARD CERTIFIED SPECIALIST AND SMALL ANIMAL INTERNAL MEDICINE AND ANIMAL WELFARE. I ALSO TEACH THE VETERINARY ETHICS COURSE AT UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE. I'M REPRESENTING THE HUMANE SOCIETY VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ORGANIZATION WITH ABOUT NINE THOUSAND VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS NATIONWIDE. INCLUDING ABOUT A THOUSAND CALIFORNIA VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS WITH A FOCUS ON THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF ALL ANIMALS. I SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIFTEEN NINE TO PROTECT DOGS FROM UNNECESSARY TESTING ACT. WHICH WOULD BRENT CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY TOXICITY TESTING ON DOGS IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE USDA ESTIMATED THAT FIVE THOUSAND DOGS IN CALIFORNIA WAS SUBJECTED TO RESEARCH FOR PRODUCT TESTING. THESE DOGS ARE EXPOSED TO DRUGS PESTICIDES AND OTHER CHEMICALS. THAT ARE OBSERVER HARMFUL EFFECTS SUCH AS NAUSEA DIARRHEA HEART FAILURE DIFFICULTY BREATHING OR EVEN DEATH. THE DOGS ARE OFTEN KILLED AFTER STUDIES THAT THEIR TISSUES AND ORGANS CAN BE EXAMINED. WINDOWS HAS BEEN STATED THAT THERE'S OFTEN POOR CORRELATION BETWEEN OUTCOMES ON ANIMALS AND OUT COMES ON HUMANS. THIS LEGISLATION PROVIDES EXEMPTIONS FOR SUCH FOR TOXICITY TESTED AFFAIR WE WERE. USING TWO BOXES WELL AS MEDICAL RE USING DRUGS WE THE STATE. ENCOURAGE THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF NON ANIMAL TESTING METHODS. THE FEDERAL FOOD DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUIRE THE USE OF ANIMALS IN TESTING PRODUCTS FOR SAFETY. THE FDA IS CONSISTENTLY ADVISED MANUFACTURERS TO EMPLOY WHATEVER TESTING IS APPROPRIATE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE SAFETY OF THEIR PRODUCTS. OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DOGS IS MAN'S BEST FRIEND SHOULD PRECLUDE DOGS FROM BEING A HARM FOR THE SAKE OF PROTECTING THE LIABILITY OF MANUFACTURERS OF CHEMICALS AND PESTICIDES. AS HAS BEEN STATED LAST YEAR THE EPA DECLARE PLANS TO AND TOXICITY TESTING FOR CHEMICALS AND PESTICIDES ON MAMMALS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN ANIMAL WELFARE HAVING BANNED THE SALE OF CAUSE MEDICS BEING TESTED ON ANIMALS AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIFTY NINE THAT HONORS OUR BOND WITH DOGS AND ENCOURAGES THE DEVELOPMENT OF NON ANIMAL ALTERNATIVES TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE. MONICA ANGER BIRTH MOM BEHALF OF CRUELTY FREE INTERNATIONAL IN SUPPORT. WHEN YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SAYS A MAN NOT LIGHT HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND IN SUPPORT ABOUT THANK YOU. MATT ROBINSON WE SHUDDER INTO SMELTER LYING I WAS ASKED TO CONVEY THE SUPPORT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT SING NONE IS THEIR OPPOSITION. I THINK. MORNING JENNIFER SNYDER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION I'M IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID A FORMAL- OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL WE DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST LAST WEEK TO MAKE WITH THE AUTHOR- AND WE WANT TO FIRST- EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE FOR HER- WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US AND- AND TAKE SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE REQUESTED ON THE WHEN WE TALKED TO HER JUST LATE LAST WEEK- I THINK. WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE JUST WE ACTUALLY JUST SAW THE AMENDMENTS YESTERDAY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK- AND AGAIN AS WE DO APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE AND WE THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE ARE STILL TAKING THE TIME TO ACTUALLY REVIEW THOSE AMENDMENTS- I'D WE CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO HINDER THE AUTHOR'S INTENT HERE WITH THIS BILL AT ALL- AND WE DON'T WE DON'T CONDONE AND THE CERES INTO PRO. I'M A USE OF DRUGS FOR SALAS TEST I THINK I'M FOR US IT'S ABOUT THE TWO THAT ARE USED IN THE BILL IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY COVER I DO DEVELOP FROM BIOLOGICAL SEARCH MEDICAL RESEARCH FROM START TO FINISH- AND IT'S NOT JUST ON THE ACTUAL DRUG DEVELOPMENT SELF BUT IT'S NOW WHAT GOOD INTO IT BEFORE CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEN- AFRICA'S SKIN SICK DETECTING THAT HAPPENS ONCE- THAT DRUGS ON THE MARKET SO FOR US IT'S JUST MORE ABOUT THE TERMS DETER AND WE SO. WE CAN'T CAN'T WORK WITH THIRD SHE'S MINUTES DO THAT I'M WE WILL BE ALL CIRCUIT TURNED THIS IS THE ONLY POLICY ON THE BILL SO WE MAYBE THE WE HAVE THE T WERE WITH HER AND- AS THIS BILL MOVES ON I'M IN THE PROCESS SO- PRITCHETT YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS GOOD MORNING YOU FOR OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE- I'M DOCTOR AMANDA UP BANKS FOR THE CALIFORNIA BY MEDICAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION. NOW LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING TO. CORRECT A FEW MISCONCEPTIONS AND PROVIDE SOME FACTS ABOUT BY MEDICAL RESEARCH THE NEEDS ANIMAL MODELS ONE OF THE COMMON BELIEF THAT ALTERNATIVES EXIST THAT CAN REPLACE THE WILL OF ANIMALS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE WHAT ALTERNATIVES A WIDELY USED WHENEVER POSSIBLE. FEDERAL LAW EXPECTS ANIMAL MODELS THERE'S NOTHING CAN WEEKS PLACE THE USE OF A WHOLE LIVING SYSTEM WHEN DEVELOPING DRUGS ENGAGING DRUG SAFETY AND EFFICACY. 95% OF ALL ANIMAL WORK NECESSARY IS CONDUCTED IN RODENTS AND LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT. OF SUCH WORK TAKES PLACE AND DOGS. OF THE DOGS NECESSARY PERFECT RESEARCH AND TEACHING CALIFORNIA 97% OR ADOPTED OUT TO FOREVER HOMES WHEN THE RESEARCH PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED. THE FDA EXPECTS SUCH WORK TO BE SHOWN EFFECTIVE IN TWO ANIMALMODELS TYPICALLY ROTOR MODEL IN A LARGE ANIMAL WE MUST PROVE BOTH SEPARATE SAFETY EPICS THE ANIMAL MODELS. BEFORE WILL ALLOW US TO PROCEED TO TESTING IN HUMANS. WHAT THE AUTHOR AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF THE AMENDMENTS WE STILL NEED A FEW MORE TO ENSURE WE DON'T LIMIT MEDICAL RESEARCH FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES. A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO COPE WITH THE NINETEEN VACCINES AND TREATMENTS AND WILL NEED CANINE TO TEST BEFORE. ALLOWING TESTING IN HUMANS DURING THIS TIME OF THE WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC HALTING MEDICAL RESEARCH IS WEARING. WE WILL REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT AB TWENTY FIFTY NINE UNTIL WE ARE SURE THE BILL DOES NOT ADVERSELY IN MY- IMPACT MEDICAL RESEARCH FOR HUMANE. AND FOR ANIMAL HEALTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO REGISTER OPPOSITION. GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION EMILY PAPPAS NAMELY PAPPAS ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL HALTH INSTITUTE WHERE BURKE PRESENT THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE MEDICINES FOR ANIMALS. THANK YOU. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF BIO COMMON ADMIT RICHEST EXPRESSED THE SAME CONCERNS AND THANK THE OFFER FOR AUTHOR FOR HER WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US THANKS. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER KILEY. NEWS THAT PROGRAM DO YOU THINK THAT IF WE CAN LAST- TESTING ON ON DOGS THAT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO FIX OR OTHER NON ROAD MAMMALS FOR THE STATE. IS THE YES IS THE SHORT ANSWER- YOU KNOW THERE'S- WE THE E. U. USES AND SEX- BUT A NUMBER OF COMPANIES HAVE BEGUN TO USE THREE D. MODELING. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE USE CHIMPANZEES FOR TESTING AND WE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT AND WE ARE STILL ABLE TO DEVELOP. AND TEST DRUGS- THAT ARE LIFESAVING SO THIS IS A CONVERSATION ABOUT CHANGING A BUSINESS MODEL TO SAVE CANINE LIFE IT IS NOT A CONVERSATION ABOUT STOPPING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH- SOMETIMES YOU NEED A PUSH. YEAH I. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT AND I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT ANIMAL TESTING THERE'S A COMPLEX BOUNCING ABOUT THE CALL OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVISIBLE CONSIDERATIONS SPENDING I RECOGNIZE THERE'S A SPECIAL SORT OF NINE HUMAN CANINE RELATIONSHIP I'M JUST TRYING I KIND OF PROBLEM WITH FROM THE ANIMAL WELFARE YOU OUT WHAT WHAT'S THE IMPLICATIONS ABOUT A PART OF THE QUESTION CASTING FROM- CANINES. TO SOME OTHER NON ROAD. WELL I WOULD CERTAINLY OPEN TO HAVING AN ETHICAL CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW ALL SEVENTEENTH BEINGS ARE TREATED- ON THIS PLANET- BUT I THINK AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOGS LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT HAS SHOWN THAT FALSE NEGATIVES HAVE COME AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THE TESTING SUGGESTS THAT MAYBE THE THAT'S NOT THE BEST OR MOST APPROPRIATE SPECIES I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE AND- THAT THIS DOES NOT IMPACT MEDICAL RESEARCH THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE TESTING FOR THE EFFICACY OF A DRUG IT'S ABOUT TOXICITY LEVELS. AND WE'D HAVE THAT CONVERSATION YEARS AGO AROUND LEAD PAINT- RIGHT SO IT'S- NOT ABOUT IF THE PAINT WORKS IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH TOXICITY IS IN THE PAIN AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO SORT OF CONTINUE TO KEEP OR TO MOVE AWAY FROM. WE MOVED AWAY FROM IT- SO YOU CAN YOU CAN STILL TEST IT ALSO DOES NOT IMPACT TESTING ON- DRUGS THAT ARE USED ON ANIMALS IN ON DOGS. SO I KNOW THAT THAT WAS STATED AND SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE- DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT REQUIRE TESTING ON A NON RODENT SPECIES BESIDES I KNOW YOUR- MA'AM IN SETTING DEAL WITH THE USDA BUT ARE THERE OTHER. FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT REQUIRED. THERE ARE SOME- EPA REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN DRUG TEST WHICH WOULD BE EXEMPT BY THIS BILL AND THEN FTA DOES NOT ALL EDC CDC DOESN'T DO ANY MANDATE ANY TESTING THEY DO LOOK AT- DRUGS FOR EXAMPLE A MAN APPROVED BY FDA AND AN ADVOCATE FOR THIS TO BE. IF THERE WERE OTHER. FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT REQUIRE THIS ON EARTH BETWEEN NOW AND APPROPRIATIONS YOU'D BE WILLING TO YES- SO THIS DOES SAY THAT THIS EXEMPTS ALL- THAT ARE REQUIRED BY LAW BY FEDERAL LAW I ANY FEDERALLY RIGHT. OKAY TO FILL FEDERAL AGENCY SAYS DOGS SPECIFICALLY YEAH. THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE EXEMPT. IF IT REQUIRES. TESTING ON A NON RODENT SPECIES. PACIFIC WE DOCK. SO IF THERE'S A IF A FEDERAL ID OTHER I'M SORRY I'M JUST NOW NOW I'M GETTING CONCERNED THAT WE'RE PICKING LIKE. ONE ANIMAL UHHUH WENT I MEAN AS A RABBIT WELL I WOULD CERTAINLY LOVE TO HAVE OF A BILL THAT SAYS WE STOP TESTING ON ALL ANIMALS- AND I'M SURE THESE NICE PEOPLE WOULD. NOT LOVE TO HAVE THAT AND SO WE ARE CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN A GLOBAL STEP FORWARD- BUT- SOMETIMES IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE INCREMENTAL STEPS SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS CONVERSATION BUT I WOULD LOVE IT- IF WE COULD SEE THE DAY WERE WERE NOT TESTING ON ANY ANIMALS AT ALL. DO YOU KNOW BESIDES DOG WHAT OTHER- ANIMALS ARE BEING TESTED THEN WHEN THEY'RE REQUIRED TO TEST NON RODENT SPECIES. VARIOUS OTHER SPECIES NO I NOW IRIS VERY VERIFY MAY I MEAN LIKE I'M OKAY WITH FERRIS BUT JUST JOKING JUST JOKING PLEASE DON'T EMAIL ME ABOUT THE PARENTS. WE'VE ALL BEEN DOWN THAT HOLE. I'M I'M JOKING. NOT JOKING THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN DOWN THAT HOLE- YES I OULD LOVE AN ANSWER I'M JUST I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE PUSHING IN THE TESTING TOWARDS HERE OF COURSE NOT YES WE ARE THERE'S REQUIRE WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR NON ANIMAL METHODS TO BE WHAT IT'S WHATEVER RIGHT OFF THE WALL- OTHER SPECIES ARE FAIR IT'S PRIMATES OTHER CURRENT VIRUS ARE FAIR AT SOME PRIMATES BEING USED RIGHT NOW. IT IS. ONE OF THE REASON THE ANIMAL YOU. AND WE USE NUMBERS FOR DOGS IS SO LOW IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER MODELS THAT ARE SO SPECIFICALLY. DESIGNED FOR EACH DISEASE THAT WE RESEARCH FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE STUDYING A MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ELECTRIC EELS OF THE MODEL OF CHOICE OF YOUR STUDYING. FOR INSTANCE LEPROSY ARMADILLOS AND MODEL CHOICE AND SO. CANINES OF THE MODEL OF CHOICE FOR VERY SPECIFIC PORTION OF DISEASE RESEARCH AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT WE MIGHT NEED TO DO. CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO. DEVELOP A DRUG FOR I DON'T KNOW BREAST CANCER AND USE IT AND DODD RESEARCH A MAN AND YOU STOCKS OF THE MODEL JUST. NOT THE CORRECT MODEL TO DO THAT. AND I DO WHAT THE FLICK TO SNEAK IN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER THAT. OF THE AUTHOR MENTION THAT FIVE THOUSAND DOGS WERE USED IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA I'M SORRY THIS IS NOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VEER OFF OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS GALLAGHER. YES SO I THINK I'M I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- I THINK THE- YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A PRACTICALITY ARGUMENT HERE AND THEN AND THEN THERE'S KIND OF A MORAL ARGUMENT IN THE PRACTICALITY IS IT APPEARS FROM SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT DOGS AREN'T ALWAYS A VERY GOOD INDICATOR OF. WHAT IS TOXIC TOWARDS HUMANS SAID OR AT LEAST THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VERY ABILITY AND SO WE'RE KINDA SAYING LOOK WHY USE AN ANIMAL THAT'S NOT VERY INDICATIVE OF TOXICITY RIGHT- AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF. A BIG REASON FOR MY SPORT BUT I THINK WHAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING THAT. IN SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION. IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE SAYING WE'RE OKAY WITH DOING TESTING. AND BECAUSE WHAT'S BECAUSE THE IMPLICATION HERE IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TOXICITY IN HUMANS WHEN WE USE DIFFERENT DRUGS OR WHEN WE'RE USING DIFFERENT. AND THE IDEA IS TO PROTECT. YOUR HUMAN LIFE AND- IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO DO SOME KIND OF TESTING TO SEE IF THERE'S- GONNA BE TOXICITY AND IT'S GOING TO BE HARMFUL TO HUMANS RIGHT SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE WERE AS SOCIETY EXCEPT IN SOME LEVEL OF TESTING. BUT THEN WE GET INTO LIKE WILL WHICH ANIMALS ARE OKAY TO TEST ON RAY. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE. YEAH I GUESS THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A STRUGGLE THERE LIKE ARE A RODENT SOMEHOW LESSER ANIMALS AND OTHERS- I THINK. A LOT OF US WOULD SAY YES WE LOVE OUR DOGS AND WE'RE NOT REALLY TOO THRILLED ABOUT RATS AND YOU KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW. BUT AT THE SAME TIME LIKE YOU SAID I MEAN THESE ARE ALL LIVING THINGS. AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO KIND OF WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE YEAH WELL YOU KNOW- IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL CONVERSATION. AND THE QUESTION ULTIMATELY IS WHAT'S THE APPETITE OF THIS BODY OR EVEN OUR CULTURE TO SAY CAN WE CONTINUE SCIENTIFIC TESTING WITHOUT DOING IT ON. ANIMALS ON CREATURES AT ALL I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO. MAKE AN DEVELOP A CAR THAT CAN DRIVE ITSELF. YOU CAN PROBABLY FIND A SCIENTIFIC METHOD THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO TEST TOXICITY LEVELS AND THE EFFICACY OF A DRUG WITHOUT USING A LIVING BREATHING CREATURE- BUT THAT. IS CERTAINLY UP FOR DEBATE. WE I THINK MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY THEY WANT TO MOVE TOWARDS NON ANIMAL METHODS- YOU KNOW AND ONCE AGAIN I THINK. THAT'S A QUESTION THAT SPEAKS TO YOU KNOW THE COURAGE OF A COMMUNITY TO SAY HOW DO WE MAKE THIS HAPPEN THIS IS ABOUT CHANGING A BUSINESS MODEL IS IT IS ABOUT AS YOU. ALSO STATED LOOKING AT- YOU KNOW HOW PRACTICAL IT IS TO DO SO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TESTING FOR EXAMPLE THE TAXES THE LEVELS OF ROUNDUP AND YOU'RE NOT YOU KNOW BE KILLING THE DOG BUT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S LEGAL TO HUMANS CHANCES ARE MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP DOING THAT KIND OF TEST ON THAT KIND OF CREATURE- SO I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE TIME TO GET INTO THOSE KINDS OF. EXISTENTIALIST SHINS BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE AN APPETITE AT SOME POINT TO SAY HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE THIS KIND OF SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT TO ALLOW US TO DO THESE KINDS OF STUDIES WITHOUT HARMING ANIMALS. ANY KIND OF. YOU KNOW AND HOW COME THERE ISN'T LIKE FULL DISCLOSURE ON ALL OF THE KINDS OF ANIMALS THAT ARE BEING TESTED HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE HOW MANY OF THEM DO GET ADOPTED AND HOW MANY OF THEM STAY ALIVE ONCE THEY ARE ADOPTED IN WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE- YOU KNOW BUT THOSE ARE SOME VERY REAL QUESTIONS. WHERE THE ANSWERS ARE ARE CLOAKED- I ALSO WANT TO JUST REITERATE THAT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT. TOP TEXTING ON THE EFFICACY OF. DRUGS AND SO I WOULD HATE FOR US ESPECIALLY IN THIS CLIMATE TO CONFLATE MEDICAL TESTING ON YOU KNOW HOW TO CURE VIRUSES. WITH TOXICITY LEVELS OF- YOU KNOW PESTICIDES AND OTHER CHEMICALS. IN AYE CAN I HAVE ONE POINT TO THAT UNLESS. YEP AND THAT WAS JUST GONNA FALL JOBS YOU YOU WERE MENTIONING SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIVE THOUSAND NUMBER IS THAT NOT CORRECT HERE. NO ACTUALLY THE USDA REQUIRES REGISTRATION OF DOGS IN ANY SPECIES ABOVE A HAMSTER WITH THE USDA AND THEY DO AN ANNUAL CENSUS AND CALIFORNIA LAST YOU HAD FIVE THOUSAND DOGS THAT WERE CONSIDERED USED. AND MEDICAL RESEARCH OR TEACHING UNDER THE USDA- EIGHT MORE THAN 80% OF THOSE WERE ACTUALLY CONSTIPATED COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH THAT NAY TECHNICIAN TRAINING PROGRAMS WITH A TEACH PET EXAMS OR SPAY NEUTER CLINIC ASSISTANCE. ONLY 20% OF THE DOGS OF THE OF THE- A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR THOUSAND WERE INVOLVED BY MEDICAL RESEARCH AND RESEARCH AS A PERSON AS WE ARE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY- AND AFTER RESEARCH PROTOCOL IS CONCLUDED.
