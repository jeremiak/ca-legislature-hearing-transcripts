TRAILER BILL TWO HUNDRED

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:00.462
MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS A

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:02.931
CONTINUATION OF. THE SB NINE A

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:04.332
ONE DEAL THAT WAS REACHED A FEW

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:06.001
YEARS BACK AND GIVES ANOTHER

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:08.270
FIVE YEARS. OF CONTINUOUS

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:09.838
APPROPRIATION TO ORDER MILLION

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:10.839
DOLLARS OUT OF THE CAP AND

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:14.809
TRADE G. G. R. F. FUND. TO FUND

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:17.679
WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. I

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:18.280
SAID AND BUDGET INFORMATIONAL

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:20.282
HEARING. I'M NOT SURE WHO TO

THANK FOR THAT. YOU KNOW I'M

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:24.452
NOT AND I GUESS THAT'S MAYBE

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.421
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I MEAN. SO

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.156
MUCH OF THE STUFF WERE LEFT OUT

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:30.258
OF THESE DISCUSSIONS. WE TALK

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.294
ABOUT IT. WE BRING IT UP WE

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.364
WRITE LETTERS- YOU CERTAINLY

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:37.666
HEARD FOR ME A LOT ABOUT THIS

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:39.034
THIS YEAR I DON'T KNOW WHY IT

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.903
WAS SO HARD. TO MAKE SURE THIS

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.172
IS A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:44.739
THAT'S ALWAYS SAID ALL YEAR

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:47.175
LONG. IN A DIFFERENT BUDGET

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:50.011
BILLS WE'D GET OKAY HERE'S A

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:50.645
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:54.849
pACTUALLY A REDUCTION. IN

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:59.454
FUNDING. THAT'S A PROBLEM- BUT

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.456
I KNOW THAT OTHERS BEEN WORKING

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:01.990
ON THIS VERY HARD AND I'M

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:05.460
THANKFUL THAT THOSE VOICES ONE

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:06.228
OUT IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:08.463
WE HAVE THAT CONTINUOUS

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.665
APPROPRIATION COMMITMENT. WHAT

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:11.766
WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:13.034
THOUGH THAT THAT THAT'S REALLY

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:15.637
JUST A BASELINE. THAT'S A

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.739
BASELINE WE'VE HAD THE TWO

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:19.808
HUNDRED MILLION FOR AT LEAST

01:21:19.874 --> 01:21:23.545
THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND LAST

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.614
YEAR THAT MONEY WAS ACTUALLY

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.749
CUT BECAUSE THE CAP ND TRADE

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:28.283
FUND DIDN'T PRODUCE ENOUGH

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.151
REVENUE. AND THAT'S ANOTHER

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:33.355
PROBLEM. SO WE NEED TO REALLY

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.357
ENSURE THAT THIS MONEY IS GOING

01:21:35.423 --> 01:21:36.157
TO GET SPENT AND GET DOWN TO

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:39.728
PROJECTS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:40.262
EVEN WITH THE TWO HUNDRED

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:43.531
MILLION A YEAR. LAST YEAR WITH

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:44.833
THE THIRTY FIVE STREAMLINED

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:46.935
PROJECTS WE ONLY DID ELEVEN

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:49.004
THOUSAND ACRES THAT'S THE FACT.

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.373
WHEN WE NEED TO BE DOING FIVE

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:52.807
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR.

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:53.875
THAT'S WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY WE

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:55.744
NEED TO DO TO GET ON TOP OF

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.812
THIS ISSUE. AND WE NEED TO

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:59.080
TREAT THIS WITH THE URGENCY

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:13.461
THAT'S NECESSARY. SCIENTISTS

01:22:13.528 --> 01:22:14.596
TELL US THE SCIENCE TELLS US

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:16.364
THAT EVEN WITH EVERYTHING WE'RE

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.099
DOING IT WOULD BE DECADES.

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:19.567
BEFORE YOU REVERTED THE CLIMATE

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:23.838
BACK. TO WHAT WE'RE USED TO. SO

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.807
ALL THE MORE REASON THAT WE

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:27.142
NEED TO BE DOING THINGS LIKE

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.810
THIS LIKE FUEL REDUCTION ARE

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:31.313
FOREST DOUBLING DOWN ON IT LIKE

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:35.116
HAVING EARLIER ACTION. AERIAL

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:36.918
FIRES SO THEY DON'T GET BIG

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:40.121
GETTING WHEN THEY'RE SMALL. I

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.424
AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE- FROM

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.826
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO. THIS IS

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.594
ABOUT CLIMATE ADAPTATION THIS

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:47.962
IS A CLIMATE ADAPTATION

01:22:48.029 --> 01:22:50.031
STRATEGY JUST LIKE C. RISES

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:53.101
JUST LIKE INCREASING BEACHES

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:53.668
BEACH FRONT AND BRINGING AND

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:56.037
SAND. THIS IS CLIMATE

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:58.406
ADAPTATION AND YOU NEED TO

01:22:58.473 --> 01:22:58.940
TREAT IT WITH THE URGENCY

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:01.009
THAT'S NECESSARY. TWO HUNDRED

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.410
MILLION IS JUST A BASS LINE IF

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:04.379
WE THINK THAT THAT'S IT. AND WE

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:05.480
SAY HEY WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.715

WE'RE TRULY ON TOP OF THIS

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:09.184
ISSUE YOU'RE NOT PAYING

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.953
ATTENTION. WE ONLY ELEVEN

ARMS I MEAN THINK ABOUT THAT

01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:43.485
FOR A SECOND. WE'RE IN A

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:46.688
DROUGHT. WE NEED MORE WATER

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:47.956
STORAGE AND WE'RE WE'RE

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:49.691

WOULD LIKE TO SEEN IN THIS IN

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:33.194
SOME OF THESE BUDGET BILLS.

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:34.863
THAT THAT WOULD BENEFIT MY

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:37.031
COMMUNITIES MORE ABSOLUTELY I

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:38.399
GOT A COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:39.734
COUPLE COMMUNITIES THEY'RE

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:41.936
HAVING TO HAVE WATER TRUCK TO

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:43.805
THEM IT'S A TWO HOUR DRIVE.

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:45.340
THIS IS DRINKING WATER THIS IS

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:47.742
FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY. BUT

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:48.843
THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE BUDGET

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:50.512
FOR THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:52.547
APPLY FOR A GRANT. AND HOPE

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:53.481
THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET THAT

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:55.383
GRANT BUT IN THE MEANTIME IT'S

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:56.384
GOING TO BE A MILLION OR TWO

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:59.053
MILLION DOLLARS TO TRUCK WATER

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.021
FOR DRINKING WATER IN PUBLIC

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:01.956
SAFETY BUT WE DIDN'T GET THAT.

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:04.225
IN THE BUDGET. AND THAT'S AND

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:05.593
I'LL KEEP FIGHTING FOR MY

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.329
COMMUNITIES DESERVE THAT. THE

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:11.466
WILDFIRE ISSUE YOU KNOW- WE

WE CALL THAT THE DOLLYWOOD PLAN

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:21.376
A BI PARTISAN EFFORT THEY GOT

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:24.112
AS ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:26.447
FIVE YEARS FROM GIGI R. F. AND

AMOUNTS OF CARBON INTO THE

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:43.431
ATMOSPHERE. THEREBY REDUCING

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:45.633

GAVE ADDITIONAL MONEY- AFTER

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:52.574
AFTER CONVERSATION THAT'S A BIG

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.275
DEAL TO GET THE CONTINUOUS

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:55.643
APPROPRIATION FOR THE AFTER

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.712

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:08.690
NOT ENOUGH I WOULD AGREE THE L.

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:10.291
A. O. SAID IT SHOULD BE THREE

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:12.160
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:27:12.226 --> 01:27:13.728
BUT WHICH IS A LONG LONG LONG

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.430
WAY. DOWN THE ROAD IN A

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:16.864

AND A NUMBER OF FTV BEALE WE A

01:55:35.295 --> 01:55:36.829
NUMBER OF AGENCIES WHAT WE

01:55:36.896 --> 01:55:38.031
WOULD FIND OUT IS THAT THE

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:40.366
BOOKS OFTENTIMES SHOWED. THE

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:42.068

01:55:42.135 --> 01:55:44.370
THOSE ARE THE COOKBOOKS THE

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:46.272
ACTUAL DATA WHICH SHOW THAT

01:55:46.339 --> 01:55:47.407
THEY WORK TWELVE HOUR TWELVE

01:55:47.473 --> 01:55:48.708

PAYMENT WILL SHOW FOR TWENTY

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:53.313
HOURS A DAY. SO THIS DOES OCCUR

01:55:53.379 --> 01:55:55.348
EVEN IF A BOOK SHOW THAT TOOK.

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:57.383
WHAT WE ALSO FOUND OUT IS IF

01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:58.151
THERE'S NO TEETH DOES NOT

01:55:58.217 --> 01:56:00.253
LIABILITY THEY WILL COMPLY WITH

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.487
THE LAW NOW THOSE IN THE MOST

01:56:01.554 --> 01:56:03.022
EGREGIOUS OF ACTS AND IT

01:56:03.089 --> 01:56:04.590
HAPPENED EVERYWHERE. RIGHT

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:05.658
SMACK CENTER DOWNTOWN LOS

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:07.927
ANGELES I REPRESENT BUT ALSO ON

01:56:07.994 --> 01:56:08.861
THE L. A. COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:09.929
BOARD THAT I WORKED AT WHERE

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:12.665
THEY DID HAVE WITH THE DID HELP

01:56:12.732 --> 01:56:13.266
RULES REGULATIONS FOR THIS TO

01:56:13.333 --> 01:56:15.535
HAPPEN. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT

01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:17.370
THIS HAPPENS AND IF YOU DON'T

01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:18.137

THIS WASN'T JUST A ONE TIME

01:56:23.976 --> 01:56:25.345
THING. THIS HAPPENED OVER AND

01:56:25.411 --> 01:56:27.780
OVER. SO THIS BILL IS

01:56:27.847 --> 01:56:29.215
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BECAUSE IF

01:56:29.282 --> 01:56:30.416
YOU DON'T HOLD SOMEBODY

01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:32.151
ACCOUNTABLE WON'T HAPPEN HELLO

01:56:32.218 --> 01:56:35.288
BY AND FOR. BLAME FOR THE BEST

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:36.255
CASE SCENARIO THAT THIS BILL IS

01:56:36.322 --> 01:56:37.190
NOT NEEDED BECAUSE FOLKS ARE

FOLLOWING WHAT THE LAW WHAT

01:56:39.459 --> 01:56:41.094
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. SO IF

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.528
YOU'RE A GOOD CONTRACTOR YOU

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:45.465
HAVE NOTHING TO FIGHT ON THIS.

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:46.799
IF YOUR BED CONTRACTOR YEAH YOU

01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:48.234
COULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THIS

01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:50.069
BECAUSE IT WILL HOLD YOU LIABLE

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:51.971
TO FOLLOW THE LAW WHICH IS

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:54.474
BASICALLY. WHICH BASICALLY SAYS

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:55.241
THAT YOU PAY SOMEBODY FOR THE

01:56:55.308 --> 01:56:56.876
WORK THAT THEY DID. AND IF YOU

01:56:56.943 --> 01:56:58.711
DON'T STEAL IT. AND WE ACTUALLY

01:56:58.778 --> 01:57:00.980
SAW THIS WE WOULD SEE PEOPLE

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:03.049
WHO WOULD WORK. FOR TWO WEEKS

01:57:03.116 --> 01:57:03.983
OR FOUR MONTHS WHATEVER THE

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.818
CONTRACT WAS. THEY GET PAID ON

01:57:05.885 --> 01:57:07.086
A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THAT

01:57:07.153 --> 01:57:08.721
WEIGHT. AND THEN THEY'D BE

01:57:08.788 --> 01:57:13.159
FIRED IF THEY COMPLAINED. SO WE
