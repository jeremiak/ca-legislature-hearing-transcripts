HELLO I'M SOLANO RACE DIRECTOR OF STATE LOCAL POLICY FOR PROSPERITY NOW. WE ARE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO EXPANDING FINANCIAL STABILITY WEALTH AND PROSPERITY FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I REPORT FROM THAT YALE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL REVEALED THAT. I SIXTY PERCENT ERROR RATE FOR PAID TAX. IN SO GIVEN THE CHANGES IN THE STATE TAX CODE AND THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF THE FEDERAL CODE. HOLDING PAID PAID TAX REPAIRS ACCOUNTABLE CAN HELP REDUCE ERRORS AND ENSURE FILERS. ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME FILERS. MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE CODE. WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSIDERATION AND BUT WE DO SUPPORT WITH THESE AMENDMENTS. ENSURING TRANSPARENCY SO MAKING SURE THAT OF P. TAX REPAIRS ARE DISCLOSING THEIR THERE'S FEES AND FOR SERVICES NOT JUST REFUND ANTICIPATION LOANS AND TAX. INSTITUTING A STANDARDIZED EXAM WE KNOW THAT THIS COULD AYE DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PAY TAX REPAIRS BUT. WHEN WE TALK TO FOLKS IN OTHER STATES LIKE MARYLAND THE BOARD OF INDIVIDUAL TAX PREPARERS FOUND THAT THERE WAS AN INITIAL DEBT. BUT MANY BECAME ENROLLED AGENTS AFTER THAT AND SO LASTLY ANOTHER AMENDMENT IS TO PUBLICIZE COMPLAINTS. MAKE CREATING A PUBLIC DATABASE OF COMPLAINTS WOULD HELP CONSUMERS COMPARE PREPARES. IT WOULD ALSO HELP THE HAVE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD MAKE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT POTENTIAL SUSPENSIONS. SO WITH THAT WE HAVE A FEW OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ALL HOLDEN AND THERE AND OVERALL PROSPERITY NOW SUPPORTS THREE ONE FOUR THREE WITH THESE AMENDMENTS.

A SIMILAR THOMAS WELCOME PLEASE PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. I THINK IT WAS CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT THE GIVE SPOKEN TO ALMOST EVERY. MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ALREADY ABOUT VALLEY FEVER. AND. YOU KNOW I CAN TELL YOU. VALLEY FEVER CURRENTLY HAS NO VACCINE NO CURE. WE KNOW THAT ACCORDING TO THE CDC EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CASES GO UNREPORTED EVERY SINGLE YEAR. WE KNOW THAT ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE VALLEY FEVER DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO WHICH TRYING TO GET AT THE MISDIAGNOSIS WE SEE THAT. IT'S ESTIMATED ANYWHERE BETWEEN SIXTY AND EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE FOLKS THAT. ULTIMATELY ARE DIAGNOSED OR MISDIAGNOSED INITIALLY AND WHAT THAT MEANS INITIALLY IS THAT THEY'RE GIVEN ANTIBIOTICS THAT DON'T TREAT VALLEY. SO WITH THAT LET ME JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE BILL WOULD DUE TO HELP CORRECT THIS MISDIAGNOSIS. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ON LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS TO MAKE AVAILABLE PROTOCOLS AND GUIDELINES BASED ON THE MOST. RECENT SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL EDUCATION ON VALLEY FEVER TO EDUCATE PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ON THE CAUSES OF THE DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND STATE NURSES SURVEILLANCE AND TREATMENT. WHILE EXISTING REGULATIONS ALREADY REQUIRE PHYSICIANS TO REPORT CASES OF ALLAH THEORISTS AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES PRIMARY CARE CLINICS. AND GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS TO DEVELOP ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT A WRITTEN POLICY. AND PROCEDURE REGARDING. REQUIRED REPORTING TO THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS ON THE CASE OR A SUSPECTED CASE OF VALLEY FEVER ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE INFECTED BY VALLEY FEVER FACE. IS THAT THE DISEASE'S FREQUENTLY MISDIAGNOSED AND WITH THAT I DO HAVE ONE OF MY. JOINT AUTHORS WHO WILL. SHARE HIS STORY ABOUT OUT HERE. THANK YOU A SIMILAR MEMBERS HOUSE. SO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND. CHAIR I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY IS SOMEONE THAT WAS MISDIAGNOSED. AND WAS GIVEN MEDICATION THAT REALLY DIDN'T HELP MY SITUATION BECAUSE I HAD VALLEY FEVER. AND I IT WASN'T UNTIL A NURSE. CAME IN AND ACTUALLY LOOKED AT ME. AND I ASK IF I'D BEEN GIVEN MEDICATION I SAID YES AND. I TOLD WHAT THE. BUT WHAT THE MEDICATION WAS AND SHE WAS LIKE THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP YOU HAVE VALLEY FEVER NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE KNEW THAT. BUT FOR SOME REASON SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE IT AND. SEE THE. THE SEE WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH AND IMMEDIATELY THE DIRECTION WAS CHANGED THE CORRECTION WAS MADE AND THAT I WAS ABLE TO IMPROVE SO I AM A LIVING TESTIMONY. OF EXACTLY WHY WE NEED THIS BILL TODAY. CLAIMS SUBMISSION ADDITIONAL WITNESSES SUPPORT IT WON'T KILEY DELGADO WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT WE THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL HELP EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ABOUT THIS VERY SERIOUS ILLNESS.

WHICH PROHIBITS THE OPERATORS OF INTERNET WEBSITES ONLINE SERVICES ONLINE APPLICATIONS AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS THERE ARE DIRECTOR AT. TO MINORS FROM MARKETING CERTAIN TYPES OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SELL TO MINORS FROM MARKETING I'M. HOW TO PURCHASE A SUCH AS ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO THE LAW ALSO PROHIBITS ALL WEBSITES AND SERVICES FROM MARKETING SUCH PRODUCTS TO A MINOR? IF THE OPERATOR HAS ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE THAT A MINOR IS USING THAT WEBSITE OR ONLINE SERVICE. THE LAW PROHIBITED DRUCK UP PARAPHERNALIA FROM BEING ADVERTISED TO MINORS HOWEVER DID NOT SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT THE ADVERTISING OF CANADA'S. BECAUSE AT THE TIME RECREATIONAL USE OF CANNABIS WAS NOT LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL AB TO I THIRTY SIXTY SEVEN WOULD REMEDY THIS SITUATION BY ADDING TOWN OF IS TO THE LIST OF ITEMS THAT ARE PROHIBITED FROM BEING ADVERTISED. ON CHILDREN'S WEBSITE. NOW ADDING CANNABIS TO THIS LIST WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THESE ONLINE OPERATORS SO ARE PROHIBITED FROM MARKETING CANADA'S PRODUCTS. TO A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN IF THE OPERATOR HAS KNOWLEDGE THAT THE UNDER EACH OTHER INDIVIDUALS USING OF THE SERVICE ARE ONLINE. WELL THIS BILL WOULD ALSO CONSIDER ON AN ONLINE OPERATE OPERATOR TO BE IN COMPLIANCE SO WITH THIS LAW. IF THE OPERATOR TAKES REASONABLE ACTIONS IN GOOD FAITH ARE DESIGNED TO AVOID MARKETING OF THE PRODUCT YOU ARE THOSE UNDER EIGTEEN. ARE AND FINALLY THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE OPERATOR WHAT THIRD PARTY ON HIS BEHALF FROM KNOWINGLY USING A DISCLOSING OR COMPILING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF SOMEONE UNDER EIGHTEEN.

CENA WAS SHALL WE JOIN CLUBS IDEA I SWEAR I WILL TAKE YOU. THIS ENJOYS A SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES AND WILL TAKE THIS UP ONLY SALVAGE CORPS THAT IMAGE THANK YOU. SHE ASSEMBLY WOMAN. AGUIAR-CURRY WOULD LIKE TO PERCENT. FILE ITEM TWELVE AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX MORE IN THE MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ENGAGING WITH ME ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS. WHICH I BELIEVE STRENGTH IN THE DRAFTING OF THE LANGUAGE. NEARLY TWO DOZEN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WERE IMPACTED DURING THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRE SEASON PUTTING THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS CARE RISK. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX TAKES THE RECENT EXPERIENCES OF CLINICS PHARMACIES AND HEALTH PROVIDERS INTO ACCOUNT. THE PROPOSES CHANGES THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR CAN CONTINUITY OF CARE IN THE FACE OF NATURAL DISASTERS. THIS BILL SETS OUT AN ACCELERATED PERMITTING PROCESS FOR TEMPORARY PHARMACY LICENSES DURING A PROCLAIM STATE OF EMERGENCY. WHICH IS THE CENTRAL WHEN A HEALTH CENTER HAS BEEN DESTROYED OR CANNOT OPERATE THE PHARMACY TO DISPENSE MEDICATION TO PATIENTS. AUTHORIZING THE BOARD OF PHARMACY TWO ISSUED TEMPORARY PHARMACY LICENSES TO CLINICS AND MOBILE PHARMACIES. WILL PROVIDE PATIENTS IN DISTRESS. ACCESS TO MEDICAID MEDICATIONS WITHOUT DISRUPTION. IT IS IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST TO TEMPORARILY INCREASE FLEXIBILITY DURING THESE TRYING TIMES TO PROVIDE FOR OUR PATIENTS NEEDS. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT MILLION FARE FROM THE DIRECTOR OF COMPLIANCE ASSURANCES SANTA ROSA COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER AND. MAY CONSUMERS FROM CALIFORNIA HEALTH. OUT ADVOCATES. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS KNOWING PHARAOH I'M THE DIRECTOR OF COMPLIANCE INSURANCE AT SANTA ROSA COMMUNITY HEALTH. A NONPROFIT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER PROVIDING OUTPATIENT MEDICAL DENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AT ELEVEN CAMPUSES FOR OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PATIENTS THROUGHOUT SANTA ROSA. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WE SERVE ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. ONE THIRD OF OUR PATIENTS ARE CHILDREN. MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILY WE CARE FOR ALREADY STRUGGLED WITH HIGH HOUSING COSTS AND HOMELESSNESS BEFORE THE FIRES. ON OCTOBER NINTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN SANTA ROSA COMMUNITY HEALTH'S LARGEST HEALTH CENTER A VISTA CAMPUS WAS DESTROYED. DUE TO EXTENSIVE FIRE SMOKE HEAT AND WATER DAMAGE IN THE FIRE STORM THAT HIT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OF NOTE THE VISTA CAMPUS WAS HOME TO ONE OF JUST TWO PHARMACIES COLOCATED AT SANTA ROSA COMMUNITY HEALTH SITES. IN A FEW SHORT HOURS TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND OTHER PATIENTS LOST THEIR MEDICAL HOME. WHERE THEY HAD RECEIVED COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES? AND HOUR ORGANIZATION WAS DOWN TO JUST ONE PHARMACY DEDICATED TO SERVING ALL OF SANTA ROSA COMMUNITY HEALTH PATIENTS. WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE COLOCATED PHARMACY SERVICES ARE ORGANIZATIONS SET SUSTAINABILITY AND OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTH AND WELL BEING WAS. AND STILL IS AT RISK. WHILE THE FIRES WERE STILL RAGING WHILE OUR PHONE LINES WERE DOWN AND OUR IT SERVERS WERE DESTROYED. WHILE WE WERE STILL TRIAGE IN OUR DAMAGES AND MANAGING TEMPORARY CLOSURES AT VARIOUS SITES. DUE TO SMOKE AND CHANGING FIRE PATTERNS WE NEVER STOP PROVIDING HEALTH CARE OF PATIENTS NEEDED. I PRIORITIES REMAIN TO SEE ALL OF OUR PATIENTS WHO NEED CARE AND SERVE ALL OF THEIR NOON NEEDS. INCLUDING ACCESS TO PHARMACEUTICALS AND MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. TO PROVIDE MEDICAL MEANINGFUL WORK FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLY SPACE FOR A NURSE PRACTITIONER AND FAMILY PRACTICE RESIDENTS TO CONTINUE. THEIR TRAINING. OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD IN LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. TO DOESN'T HEALTH CENTER CORPORATIONS SERVING A TEN COUNTY REGION AND ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS WERE IMPACTED BY FIRES. WHEN THE HEALTH CENTER OR A COLOCATED PHARMACY HAS BEEN DESTROYED DAMAGED OR CLOSED. THE PHARMACY SERVICES INCLUDING THE DISPENSING OF MEDICATION IS IMPACTED TO. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED TO PRESERVE PHARMACY ACCESS DURING AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE DECLARED EMERGENCY. LAST OCTOBER WHERE AND WHEN IT WAS SAFE TO OPERATE* CENTER STAFF RUSHED TO PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE ANYWAY THEY COULD. AND WE IMMEDIATELY TRY TO RESTORE THE LEVEL OF PHARMACEUTICAL ACCESS A PATIENT'S RELIED ON. BUT AS I SIT HERE TODAY THE LEVEL OF PHARMACY ACCESS IS STILL NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. AND THE IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE NEED HAVE TAKEN FAR TOO LONG. WHILE EXISTING LAW ALREADY HAS SIGNIFICANT ALLOWANCES FOR EMERGENCY PRESCRIPTIONS AND PHARMACY ACTIVITIES DURING EMERGENCIES. THERE WAS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH GUIDANCE IN THE LAW AS IT RELATES TO CLINIC PERMITS FOR PHARMACIES AND COLOCATED PHARMACIES. AS A RESULT AFTER WE IDENTIFY THE HEALTH CENTER SITE WHERE WE WANTED TO PROVIDE POST DISASTER PATIENT SERVICES. THERE WERE ADMINISTRATIVE DELAYS FOR OUR CLINIC DISPENSARY TO BECOME OPERATIONAL. SIMILARLY AS WE RUSHED TO OPEN A NEW SITE PLANNEDPRIOR TO THE FIRE STORMS BUT NOW NEEDED MORE URGENTLY. WE AGAIN FOUND THE CURRENT LICENSING PROCESS TO BE LIMITING. AND WHILE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE BOARD OF PHARMACY RESPONDED TO OUR URGENT NEEDS AS BEST THEY COULD. IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WE COULD DO BETTER TO SUPPORT DECISIVE QUICK RESPONSES BY CREATING A CLEAR POLICY PATH. THAT IS NOW BUILT INTO AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX. WE MUST LEARN FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO MAKE SURE HEALTH CENTERS ARE BETTER PREPARED TO CONTINUE DELIVERING CARE. DURING AND AFTER DECLARED EMERGENCY AND THIS BILL AIMS TO PROVIDE THE BOARD OF PHARMACY ADDITIONAL TOOLS NECESSARY TO STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING PROCESS FOR CLINIC PHARMACIES. AND LICENSING FOR COLOCATED PHARMACIES DURING DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY ON AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SAY THANK IF I COULD JUST INTERRUPT YOU FOR SECOND.

THE FOUR SEASONS THE COALITION OF MORE THAN THIRTY LEAVING STATEWIDE CONSUMER HEALTH ORGANIZATION SOME PROVIDER GROUPS TO PROMOTE THE COLLABORATIVE WORK OF POLICYMAKERS. INDUSTRY LEADERS PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THREE PAINS TO CURTAIL PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERPAYMENT ALSO KNOWN AS FAR BACK. WHEN COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS COPAYMENTS EXCEED THE TOTAL COST OF THE DRUG TO THEIR INSURANCE OUR PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER. THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO LEARN ABOUT THIS TYPE OF ANTI CONSUMER PRACTICE. WE BELIEVE TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THREE HAS THE SOLUTION TO HELP CONSUMERS. ONE AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THREE WOULD LIMIT THE AMOUNT HEALTH CARRIER PBM MAY REQUIRE A BENEFICIARY TO PAY AT THE POINT OF SALE. FOR COVERED PRESCRIPTION TO THE LOWEST AVAILABLE COST WHETHER IS IT APPLICABLE CARSHARING AMOUNT FOR THE RETAIL PRICE. ENSURING CONSUMERS ARE NOT OVERPAYING FOR THEIR PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS. THEY WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE RETAIL PRICE INSTEAD OF JUST THE CO PAY TO APPLY TOWARDS THEIR DEDUCTIBLE IN OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM. IF THE BENEFICIARY OPS TO PAY THE CASH PRICE. AND IN RECENT STUDY DONE BY U. S. C. SHAPER CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS IT SIGN IT AND CITED BY ME THIRTEEN PUBLICATION FROM KAISER HEALTH NEWS. PATIENT OVER PAY FOR PRESCRIPTION TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF THE TIMES. THIS IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT SHARON OVERALL DRUG STANDING IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND IN FACT ONE PBM SHOWED REVENUE OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION AND A PROFIT OF OVER FIVE BILLION WHILE TAKING WHEN THE REST OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN BEARS ALL THE RISK THIS IS QUITE A PHENOMENON. AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THREE WILL HELP TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS THROUGH BETTER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MEDICATIONS THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED. IT WILL PUT AN END TO THE CLAWBACK AND UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES. CONSUMERS SHOULD ALWAYS. POCKET ANY OUT THERE WILL SAVINGS ON THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WE STRONGLY URGE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS BILL IS ABOUT PROVIDING ANOTHER PATH TO FOSTER YOU. WE KNOW THE STATISTICS. THANK YOU THAT FOSTER YOUTH REALLY STRUGGLE AND YET A LOT OF WHAT TO BECOME SOCIAL WORKERS AND WHAT THAT ALL THIS BILL DOES IS GIVE THEM A DAD OPPORTUNITY. BY PROVIDING A LITTLE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO SEEK THE. STANDARDS OF BECOMING A SOCIAL WORKER TO GO BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY TO BRING WHAT THEY HAD BROUGHT TO BEAR WHAT THEY HAD GONE THROUGH INTO THE SOCIAL WORK FIELD. IT'S JUST PROVIDING A LITTLE BIT OF A SET OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THEM. WITH A LOAN AMOUNTS HELPING THEM REPAY LOANS AND FIND A A BETTER PATH FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN IMPROVING THEIR LOT IN LIFE. BECAUSE THEY COME FROM SITUATIONS NOT OF THEIR FAULT NOT OF THEIR CHOOSING BUT MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND A PATH FORWARD. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE THAT THANK YOU SO WITNESSES FOR. WELL GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSE AGUILAR. AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING JENNY HOUSE OF THE SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY SIX OR EIGHT. OF FOR THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS JENNY HOUSES THAT FORMER FOX YOUTH ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN HELPING THEM IN ROLE IN GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. AB TWENTY SIX ONLY REFLECTS ONE OF JENNY HOUSES LONG STANDING VALUES WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE CLOSEST TO AN ISSUE OF UNIQUELY SUITED. TO DRIVE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. ALTHOUGH OVER NINETY THREE PERCENT OF FOSTER YOUTH ASPIRE TO GO TO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE. ONLY THREE PERCENT OF THEM WILL EARN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AND LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. WE'LL GET A MASTER'S OR DOCTORATE DEGREE. PEOPLE OF LOOK THROUGH THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM HAVE UNIQUE INSIGHT. ON THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT DRIVE SOCIAL WORK. COMBINING THE PERSONAL LIVED EXPERIENCES OF A FOX YOU CAN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. WITH A GRADUATE SOCIAL WORK DEGREE WOULD ENABLE THEM TO NOT ONLY GIVE BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. BUT WAS SENT IN THE FIELD AS A WHOLE. AB TWENTY SIX VOICE SEEKS TO CREATE A CLEAR PATHWAY. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS TO BECOME. A LEADER IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL WORK. THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE THE LOAN REPAYMENT GRANT FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR FOSTER YOUTH. AND WILL PRIORITIZE THEM IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THE LICENSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDER DUCATION PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF FOSSIL QUALIFY FOR UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM. AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SYSTEM PAYING OFF THEIR SCHOOL LOANS. BY MAKING THESE CRUCIAL INVESTMENTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE. ITS COMMITMENT AS A LEADER IN SOCIAL WORK TO THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE IN FOSTER CARE. T IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE'RE URGING SUPPORT ON AB TWENTY SIX I. THANK YOU DISH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MY NAME IS DOCTOR MIKE'S TO DIRECT. MY NAME IS DOCTOR MIKE SEGURA I HAVE A PHD COMING FROM FOSTER CARE. I WANT TO START ONLY THIS EASY FOR YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EXCEEDINGLY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE. GIVEN THAT OVER HALF OF. TRANSITION AGE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE YOU THERE. AT DESTINED FOR HOMELESSNESS OR A. YOUNG CORPORATION SYSTEM. AS THE ONE PERCENT THAT DO GO ON TO GET GRABBED AGREES. FIFTY PERCENT PERCENT OF THEM GOING TO WHAT THEY CALL THE HELPING PROFESSIONS. THAT'S PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC POLICY LIKE MYSELF. SOCIAL WORK THINGS LIKE THAT. SO IT'S A MINUSCULE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT I SEE THIS IS SOMEWHAT ROUGHLY ANALOGOUS TO SORT OF A TEACH FOR AMERICA MODEL. WHERE IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM THEY'RE GOING TO BE? OBLIGATED TO SERVE AS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS IN SOCIAL WORK WHICH IS A FIELD THAT I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF HAS EXTREMELY HIGH TURNOVER LOW INCENTIVES. SO WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IF YOU GO TO A MASSIVE VIOLENCE SHELTER. THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE ARE SURVIVORS. IF YOU GO TO A SUBSTANCE ABUSE CENTER. MANY OF THE WORKERS THERE ARE SURVIVORS. THAT EXPLAINS PART OF THE PHENOMENON OF WHY. FORMER PROSECUTOR SO MOTIVATED TO GO INTO SOCIAL WORK. AGAIN IT'S AN EXCEEDINGLY SMALL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE AND THAT'S GONNA TRANSLATE TO A DROP IN THE BUCKET IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL IMPACT. I DO WANT TO SHARE THAT. THERE ARE NO. FUNDING PROGRAMS SUPPORT FROM THE FROSTY THING GRAD SCHOOL. AS A GRAD STUDENT MYSELF I WAS COMPETING WITH THE SAME YOU KNOW FUNDING AS EVERYONE ELSE THERE ARE NO ANALOGOUS THINGS LIKE CALGARY ENERGY TO GRANTED THINGS LIKE THAT. FOR FORMER FROSTY THROUGH OUR IN GRAD SCHOOL SO ANYTHING THAT CAN INCENTIVIZE THEIR SERVICE. OUT APPRECIATE A SUPPORT ON THANK YOU. THEY DO VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEN ON ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SEEM NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND QUESTIONS ARE COMING FROM KEY MEMBERS. MISSTATEMENT AND THEN MR. THANK YOU SO I NOTICE YOU HAVE NOBODY. YOU DON'T HAVE NAY LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS HERE WITH YOU SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. TRUE. OKAY UP AND IT WOULD JUST BE REMISS OF ME NOT TO SAY AS A LCSW THAT YOU ARE. US IF THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME PROGRAM THE TITLE FOR THE PROGRAM WHICH WE HAVE THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO WORK IN AN CHAO PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND AND PAYS FOR A PORTION OF THEIR. GRADUATE SCHOOL A AS WELL AS NAME PLACES THEM IN IN FUEL PLACEMENT SPECIFICALLY IN. A. JOB OFFER AGENCIES. AND THAT IS THAT IS STATE FUND THAT TEACH FOR AMERICA THAT IS ALSO FUNDED BY A GENERAL FUNDS. SO YOU ARE IT IS IT JUST ME OR DOUBLING THE FEES YOU ARE DOUBLING THE FEES ON A POPULATION A DEMOGRAPHIC WHO HAS CHOSEN TO GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE. DOES NOT MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. AND SO IT. I WILL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND BECAUSE SOCIAL WORKERS AND ENCOUNTERS ARE NICE PEOPLE I DON'T THINK YOU SEE ANYBODY HERE. BUT IF THEM I WOULD TO SAY IF WE WERE DOING IT TO REAL ESTATE AGENTS TO ANYBODY ELSE I WOULD IMAGINE THERE WAS A RECENT BOOK SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION WHEN YOU. DOUBLE. THE FEE FOR ONE TO RENEW ONCE LICENSE. IT AND THAT IS A VERY GOOD POINT THAT YOU MAKE WE ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO SEE BECAUSE OF COURSE THE TEST WAS THERE THEN THIS NO OPPOSITION FROM THAT GROUP. I WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT THIS IF THERE WAS A LOT OF CONSTERNATION. POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN. THESE ARE WORKERS THISIS A COMMUNITY WHO ABSOLUTELY CARES ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVE THEY ARE UNFORTUNATELY WILLING. TO SEE THIS DOUBLING DEFEATS BECAUSE THIS IS AN EXISTING PROGRAM AND WHAT WE'RE ALL WE'RE DOING REALLY HERE'S EXPANDING IT. THEY WERE WILLING TO DO THAT. AND AYE WAS HATED THAT MAKES ME WANT TO GO FIND ANOTHER FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS ABSOLUTELY DOES. BUT WE HAVE THE FUNDING SOURCE WE HAVE THE PROGRAM. OVER REALLY DOING IS EXPANDING AT. FROM A POPULATION WHO IS WILLING TO HELP. I WOULD YOUR POINT I WOULD. I WOULD HOPE THAT OTHER. AREAS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXPANDING HE'S ESPECIALLY WHEN WERE ADDRESSING A SMALL POPULATION. WHO REALLY NEEDS US TO STAND UP FOR THEM THAT THEY WOULD BE THE SAME LEVEL OF WILLINGNESS? TO HELP AS WE ARE FROM THE FOLKS FROM HOME WE ARE ASKING FOR THE CITIES ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT QUESTION. AND THAT'S WHY WE DID THAT OUREACH TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS NOT GOING TO BE ANY OPPOSITION TO IT. THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THRILLED. BUT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND. WE'RE NOT OPPOSED. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE UP FOR. A LOT OF A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE VALUE BASED IF WE REALLY DO VALUE THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEN THEM WE SHOULD FIND. DIFFERENT WAYS TO PAY FOR IT THINK CONTINUING A TO TO CHARGE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE WORK. YES AND IT THIS THIS WASN'T ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAM MAYBE WE SHOULD PROPOSE THAT MAKE UP A BUDGET ASK I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITHIN. THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAD BECAUSE THOSE ARE USUALLY THE EASIEST BILLS TO GET THROUGH. BUT THE SIZE THE POPULATION THE BENEFITS THAT THIS PROVIDES GETTING SOME OF THESE KIDS INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND. AND REALLY HELPING THAT BROADER POPULATION IS IS ABSOLUTELY A LOT OF LOCAL SO WE DO WORK WITH THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE. AND. HAPPY TO EXPLORE OTHER WAYS OF TRYING TO PUT EVEN MORE MONEY INTO THE PROGRAM. THAT HIS SUCCESSFUL LIKE THIS AND HAS THE BENEFITS THAT IT DOES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SURE I'M NO QUESTION BY ONE I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR YOU SO DESIRE THANK YOU UNTIL I KNOW THAT YOU WORK IN THIS IN THIS SPACE ROUTE FOSTER CARE. AND SO OF AYE. IS CERTAINLY MORE THINK YOU'RE SPEAKER OF FOR ONE. SHARE HIS TESTIMONY BECAUSE CERTAINLY SAID AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW FOSTER YOUTH HAS POOL THEIR SELVES UP BY THE BOOTSTRAPS AND DONE SOMETHING SUCCESSFUL. AND RISEN TO A LEVEL OF HAVING A DOCTOR DEGREE IN THIS PARTICULAR FIELD AS OF THAT'S WE WANT TO DO IS TRY TO ENCOURAGE. OF THOSE WHO THE FOSTER SYSTEM BUILT BECAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE RECEIVED. A NUMBER OF JUST BEING DRAMATIC JAZZ. AND JUST THE WHOLE SITUATION BEING A FOSTER KID AND. FACING THOSE OPPOSITIONS. AND GIVING AVE OPPORTUNITY THAT ALL THE REST OF THE KIDS HAVE INSERTED THIS BILL DOES THAT AYE WHEN COMMEND YOU ON IT. AND AGAIN WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE COOPER OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER GIPSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER. THANK YOU I WOULD JUST IN THEM WHY CLARIFY TO SAY THAT I DON'T THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THERE'S NO OPPOSITION. IT'S STILL THE CASE THE CALIFORNIA DIVISION OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST OPPOSES THE BILL TODAY. REMOVE STATUS IT WAS NO OPPOSITION BUT WE REACHED OUT TO THE FOLKS WHO WOULD BE PAYING THIS AND THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE NOT OPPOSED TO IT THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONCERNS RAISED BECAUSE WERE PRIORITIZING FOSTER KIDS. AND BOTH FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND WE'RE GIVING THEM A STIPEND WE ARE PRIORITIZE IN THEM. YES WE ARE IN THIS CASE THIS IS A POPULATION THAT DESERVES. A LEG UP WE PRIORITIZE THEM FOR ENROLLMENT IN COLLEGES WE PRIORITIZE THEM FOR FUNDING FOR EDUCATION GETTING THEM INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL GETTING THEM TO COMPLETE. WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO TO GET BACK INTO IN THE FIELD AND AND GIVE BACK IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT I'D THERE ARE PLENTY OF NEED FOR? SOCIAL WORKERS I DON'T THINK THIS WILL IMPACT OTHERS WHO WANT TO GET IN THE FIELD BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL POPULATION AND GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY AND SOME SOME HOPE. IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT I THINK YOU AND I THINK IF YOU COMMITMENT TWO. WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE CAN HELP FOSTER YOU THINK I'M JUST ALSO MINDFUL OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF MINE WHO ARE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST IF THEY IF THEY MAY END UP PAYING THIS BUT. I I THINK YOU FOR THAT AND APPRECIATE. THE. YOUR FOCUS ON ON FOSTER CHILDREN I I'M JUST VERY CONCERNED WITH.

BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE. JUST AS A REMINDER WILL ALLOW UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AND UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE WELCOME PLEASE PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I MISTER CHAIRMAN BORIS. AS MOST OF YOU BY NOW KNOW THAT I HAD MY DAUGHTER VIA C. SURROGATE. AND WHEN I MET MY SURROGATE WE HAD THIS GREAT CAMARADERIE AND AS WE WERE I WAS WALKING BACK TO MY CAR SHE SAID OH AND BY THE WAY. I LIKE TO HAVE MY CHILDREN. WITH THE MIDWIFE. AND ICE NODDED AND I SMILED AND I WALKED TO THE CAR AND I GOT TO THE CAR AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT IS A MIDWIFE. I HAD NO IDEA. BUT I SOON LEARNED. MIDWIVES ARE EXTRAORDINARY. AND WORKING WITH ONE IS AN ENRICHING AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE. I. PEOPLE ASKED ME WHY I'VE BEEN SO COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE THREE AND A HALF YEARS LATER HERE I AM. AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS. HOW DO YOU SHOW RESPECT FOR THE PERSON WHO GAVE THEIR BODY? SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE GREATEST GIFT OF YOUR. YOU MAKE SURE THAT SHE ALWAYS HAS THE CHOICE WHEN IT COMES TO HER BODY. HOW SHE CONTINUES TO GET THAT GIFT? SO LIKE I SAID HERE I AM. THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW. FOR WHAT I BELIEVE WILL BE THE LAST TIME. IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND SO I THINK YOU GUYS FROM MY AUNT FOR YOUR INDULGENCE OVER THIS LAST THREE YEARS. BUT WE ARE AT A TIPPING POINT IN CALIFORNIA. RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS CONTINUE TO BURDEN WORKING PEOPLE. ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE IS NOT A REALITY FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS. WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO NOTHING AND LET MARKET WORK ITSELF OUT. OR WE CAN TAKE IMMEASURABLE ACTION TO MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER. WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE FIGHTING CHANCE TO SEE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. WE CAN ENSURE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE IS NOT JUST A POLITICAL TALKING POINTS. BUT AN ACTION THAT WE ARE TAKING AND WORKING TOWARDS. LIKE I SAID EARLIER I SPENT MY LAST THREE YEARS HERE IN THE LEGISLATOR FIGHT LEGISLATURE FIGHTING TO ALLOW CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIFE TO USE THEIR SKILLS. THEIR TALENTS AND THEIR TRAINING TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM BETTER. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BECOME A CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIFE. BECOMING A CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIFE IS NOT EASY. IT TAKES MANY STEPS INCLUDING GRADUATING FROM A NURSING PROGRAM. PASSING THAT AND KLAX AND BEING IT LICENSE DOES A REGISTERED NURSE. AFTER THEY BECOME A REGISTERED NURSE THEY MUST ATTAIN A MASTER'S DEGREE OR HIGHER IN THEIR SMITH THREE. AND MANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS REQUIRE ONE OR MORE YEARS OF NURSING EXPERIENCE TO GAIN ADMISSION. ONCE THEY HAVE BECOME A REGISTERED NURSE GAIN EXPERIENCE COMPLETED A GRADUATE LEVEL PROGRAM UNEARTHLY WE'VE NOW THEY MUST PASSED THE NATIONAL CERTIFICATION EXAM IN NURSE MIDWIFERY. AND AFTER THE HAVE BECOME AND REGISTERED NURSE GAIN EXPERIENCE. A GRADUATE LEVEL. PASSED THE NATIONAL EXAM THEY MUST APPLY AND E APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSE FOR ADVANCED PRACTICING NURSE LICENSURE IN CERTIFIED NURSE MY FURRY. MIDWIFERY. AND AFTER ALL THAT THE READY TO GO TO WORK SPECIALISING IN WOMEN'S HEALTH AND MATERNAL CARE. WE HAVE NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE MOST OTHER STATES ALLOW CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY WERE ONE OF ONLY SIX STATES THAT STILL REQUIRE PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION. CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES CNN TO PRACTICE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A PHYSICIAN BUT SPECIFIES BUT THATS SUPERVISION REQUIREMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO REQUIRE THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF A PHYSICIAN. AND I WANNA REITERATE THAT. THE PHYSICIAN IS NOT PHYSICALLY PRESENT DURING BIRTH UNDER CURRENT LAW. ALTHOUGH THE SUPERVISION REQUIREMENT HEATHER C. N. N.'S TO PRACTICE ONLY ONE WHERE A PHYSICIAN CAN SUPERVISE IT DOES NOT CONSIST OF ANY ACTUAL OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. INSPECTION A REVIEW OF CHARTS CO SIGNATURES ON PRESCRIPTION DIRECT CARE OF THE PATIENT OR EVALUATION OF CNN PATIENTS AT ANY POINT DURING PREGNANCY OR A WELL WOMAN CARE. IN COMMUNITIES WITHOUT OBSTETRICIANS OR GYNECOLOGIST THE SUPERVISION REQUIRED LIMITS ACCESS TO CARE FOR WOMEN EVEN WHEN A SENATE CNM IS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE CARE. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AB THIRTEEN NO IT WAS APPROVED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR TO REMOVE PHYSICIAN'S SUPERVISION OF LICENSED MIDWIVES. UNLIKE LICENSED MIDWIVES CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A GRADUATE LEVEL OF EDUCATION. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR LICENSURE AND YET ARE STILL SUBJECT TO PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION. AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO CREATES A LEVEL OF PARITY IN LAW. BETWEEN ISLANDS AND CNN'S BY REMOVING THE PHYSICIAN'S SUPERVISION REQUIREMENT FOR CNN'S. ALLOWING THEM PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY WITH IN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. I ASK THE SERGEANTS TO PASS OUT A SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON OF C. N. N.'S AND AND IT EL ENDS REGULATORY BODIES. AN EDUCATION SO THAT YOU HAVE IT. IN ADDITION AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TO SPECIFY THAT CNN SHALL CONSULT WITH AND IF NECESSARY CO MANAGE REFER TO OR TRANSFER CARE TO ITS POSITION INSURGENT IN ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS. IF THE CURRENT CONDITION IS BE ON THE CNM SCOPE OF PRACTICE BASED ON EDUCATION IN PREPARATION. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT A CONDITION OR DISEASE LIKELY JEOPARDIZES THE HEALTH OR LIFE OF THE NEWBORN OUR MOTHER. THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND PET PERSONNEL ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE SETTING OF CARE. PREGNANCY IS NOT A HIGH RISK MEDICAL CONDITION. LOOK PERMITTED TO WORK TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR EDUCATION EXPERIENCE CNN'S CAN EXPERTLY MANAGE MORE PERSON CALIFORNIA. I'M TELLING CNN FROM PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION REQUIREMENT WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR THOUSANDS OF WOMEN IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO IS A GOOD STEP TO GIVE CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE AND IT IS IMMEASURABLE ACTION TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM BETTER. WE HAVE HAD GREAT STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER MEETING HIS. A WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL AGAIN LIKE I SAID FOR FLORA. ALLOWING TO ME TO BE BACK HERE AGAIN YEAR AFTER YEAR AND HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE LAST TIME IN THIS COMMITTEE YOU WILL HEAR FROM ME. WITH THAT UP TO DATE WE HAVE HOLLY SMITH THE CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIFE AND DR ANNETTE FEINBERG OBGYN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND TO AND. SUMMER BURKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TESTING OR GIVE FOR FOR A HUG NO HASHEM. YOUR. QUITE PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION AGAIN FROM AT AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC UP TO THREE MINUTES TOTAL FOR TESTIMONY SUPPORT THESE WHEN EVERY READING. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS HOLLY SMITH I AM A NURSE MIDWIFE IN THE CO CHAIR OF THE HEALTH POLICY COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA NURSE MIDWIVES ASSOCIATION. NATIONWIDE POLICYMAKERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE SOUNDING THE ALARM ON THE MATERNITY CARE CRISIS. CURRENTLY THE UNITED STATES HAS THE WORST MATERNAL DEATH RATE AMONG ALL COUNTRIES IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD. IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE MADE SOME AMAZING PROGRESS IN REGARDS TO DEATH DURING PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH. DESPITE THIS BLACK WOMEN ARE STILL DYING AT A RATE THREE TO FOUR TIMES THAT OF WHITE WITH. CAESAREAN SECTION IS NOW THE MOST COMMON HOSPITAL SURGERY AND PRETERM BIRTH THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE IS INCREASING AND CALIFORNIA AFTER YEARS OF DECLINE. ADD TO THIS CRISIS THE SEVERE AND WORSENING SHORTAGE OF OB CHAINS THROUGHOUT THE STATE NINE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE NO OBSTETRICIAN AT ALL NINETEEN COUNTIES HAVE FIVE OR FEWER. AND THERE HAS BEEN NO INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OBSTETRICIANS TRAIN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY. TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM EIGHTY TWO SIX EIGHT TWO SIX TO REMOVE THE SUPERVISORY TETHER FROM NURSE MIDWIFERY PRACTICE. SO THAT WE CAN GO WHERE WE ARE NEEDED. AS OTHER STATES HAVE PROVEN PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION DOES NOT IMPROVE SAFETY NOR OVERSIGHT. THE DATA CLEARLY REVEALED THAT RURAL AND HEALTH PROVIDER SHORTAGE AREAS FOR SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WE ARE FAILING WOMEN AND BABIES IN THESE AREAS. YOU COULD EVEN SAY THAT OUR UNWILLINGNESS TO INTEGRATE NURSE MIDWIVES TO IMPROVE THE MATERNITY CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THESE PLACES THAT NEED IT MOST IS IN FACT HARMING WOMEN. MY HOPE TODAY IS THAT YOU WILL SEE THE URGENCY OF THIS CRISIS. TO SIMPLY CONTINUE AS WE ARE ESSENTIALLY MEANS WE ARE OKAY WITH THE STATUS QUO. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT HOW WE VALUE WOMEN AND FAMILIES?

AND TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHER CALIFORNIANS HAVE THAT GREATER ACCESS. AND WE'VE AS YOU POINTED OUT VERY WELL HAVE ALREADY.

THANKS VERY MUCH FOR SHARING NUMBERS BIG YOU VERY MUCH. A SUMMER MOVIE NOW IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT TEN BUT IT'S OUR STANDING AT LEAST PROCESS AND A TESTIMONY TODAY BUT NOT SIMPLY VOTERS THAT CORRECT YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CLARE. WE GOT A. CALIFORNIANS WHO TRAVELED. FROM NEAR AND FAR TOO I TO SHARE TESTIMONY AND I WANTED TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY OTHERS A LOT OF. INTEREST IN THIS BILL AND WANTED TO HAVE IT AIRED. IN NO WAY THAT YOU CAN ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY EIGHT TEN TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIA SUN GROWN CANNABIS COMMISSION. AND CALIFORNIA INDOOR GROWN CANNABIS COMMISSION SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS VOTED TO AUTHORIZE THE CREATION OF MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONS. TODAY NINETEEN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE INDUSTRY THEY PRESENT REPRESENT INCLUDING LAST YEAR'S BILL AUTHORIZING THE SPINY LOBSTER INDUSTRY TO FORM A COMMISSION. I GET JOB ON THAT ONE. PROP SIXTY FOUR MADE CANNABIS ILLEGAL CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS SON GROWN CANNABIS FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY FARMER UN I REPRESENT THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH MARKET SHARE. GOVERNMENT REGULATION COSTS AND SUSTAINABILITY WHILE THEY GROW THE SAME PRODUCT THE INDOOR CULTIVATORS FACE VERY DIFFERENT ISSUES BOTH SEGMENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM THE STRUCTURE. OF AN AGRICULTURAL COMMISSION. THE SUN GROWN CANADA A COMMISSION WILL REPRESENT OUTDOOR CANNABIS FARMERS WITH EITHER AN OUTDOOR OR MIXED LIGHT LICENSE FOR STATE. THESE ARE THE TRADITIONAL SMALL FAMILY OPERATIONS MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FARMING. FOR DECADES. THE INDOOR COMMISSION OR REPRESENT INDOOR CANNABIS CULTIVATORS IN CALIFORNIA INDOOR CULTIVATIONS REPRESENT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF REGULATORY AND MARKET ISSUES THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE COMMISSION. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO A FEW ISSUES RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS. FIRST IS THE. CONCERNED THAT THE COMMISSIONS ARE NOT APPROPRIATE THIS TIME BECAUSE CANNABIS CULTIVATION IS A PARTICULARLY VOLATILE SECTOR. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT CDFA. STATES THAT THE NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN ACT THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF COMMISSIONS WAS ESTABLISHED AND I QUOTE. TO BRING STABILITY TO AGRICULTURAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION THE GROWERS IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY WILL HAVE FINAL SAY ON ESTABLISHING A COMMISSION. WHEN IMPLEMENTATION VOTE IS PUT BEFORE THEM. AS YOU'LL HEAR FURTHER TODAY FROM FARMERS THEMSELVES THE TWO COMMISSIONS. ARE NEEDED FOR TO HELP THEIR NEEDS TO HELP MEET THEIR CONCERNS. AND ULTIMATELY ALSO WHY CREATE TWO COMMISSIONS FOR THE SAME CROP. THE ANSWER TO THAT IS WHY THE COMMISSION STRUCTURE WAS CREATED N LAW. COMMISSIONS CAN BE DESIGNED TO pFARMERS PAIN THE ASSESSMENTS. IN THIS EXAMPLE SON GROWN IN INDOOR CULTIVATORS GROW THE SAME CROP. BUT WHEN YOU ARE. BUT WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT ISSUES IT MIGHT AS WELL BE TWO DIFFERENT CROPS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH NEEDS GROWING PRACTICES MARKET CONCERNS AT SARAH. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE AB TWENTY TEN AND ASSURE TESTIMONY IS CHRIS NEVIN LL PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL CANNABIS FARMERS ASSOCIATION AND A FORMER HERSELF. AND MARVIN PINEDA WHO HAS BECOME HALF OF THE INDOOR CANNABIS INDUSTRY I ALSO HAVE LOUIS BROWN. EYES WITH AN EXPERT ON AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONS TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THE STRUCTURE IN HISTORY OF THESE ENTITIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN UP TO THREE MINUTES OUR WITNESSES WISH LIST BEGINS PLEASE. GREAT THANK YOU. MY NAME IS KRISTEN AT ALL AND I WANT TO JUST THINK EVERYONE FOR TAKING THE TIME TO. HERE COMMENTS REGARDING AB TWENTY TEN ST I'M AYE LIVING BARBERVILLE WHICH IS IN HUMBLE COUNTY AND I'M A LONG TIME MEDICAL CANNABIS FARMER. AS ONE OF THE CO FOUNDERS OF THE EMERALD GROWERS ASSOCIATION ALSO SERVE. ON THE BOARD OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WHERE I CHAIR THE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE FOR CCI A. AND THEN. AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE MENTIONED I'M THE FOUNDING CHAIR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CANNABIS FARMERS ASSOCIATION. IN SHORT I HAVE SPENT MOST OF MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE. SUPPORTING BEST PRACTICES FOR SOME GROUND CANNABIS CULTIVATORS. YOU KNOW THIS BILL IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO US A SON CROWN A COMMISSION WITH SUPPORT OUT TORN EXPLAIN TIER ONE FARMERS. WE'D DO YOU CURRENTLY MAKE US PROBABLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE CULTIVATORS IN THE STEAMY YET WE ONLY REALIZE AROUND TWENTY PERCENT OF THE MARKETPLACE. THAT'S KIND OF FLIPPED ON ITS HEAD AMERICAN WILL SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT. INDOOR CULTIVATORS ARE A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF CULTIVATORS THE SPEEDS IN THE STATE BUT YET MAKEUP AROUND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE. MARKET SHARE CURRENTLY IN THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR KEEPING THESE TO COMMISSION SEPARATE IS THAT THE RESEARCH THE REGULATORY NEEDS AND RELIEF THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENTS THAT COULD COME OUT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN A COMMISSION ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN. SONG GROWN FARMERS AND WOOD INDOOR FARMERS NEED. WHAT WE NEED FOR RESEARCH IS MUCH MORE BEAST IN THE ROUND OF APPELLATION OF ORIGIN? ENVIRONMENTAL IN WATERSHED BEST PRACTICES I'M LEARNING HOW TO OPERATE WITHIN THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE LAND SO THAT WE CAN. SUSTAIN OURSELVES ON OUR HOMESTEADS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN CALLED TO BE MEAN FOR DECADES UP POINT. AND ALSO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FROM A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE IS WE HAVE EXPONENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS COMPARED TO INDOOR CULTIVATORS WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE WATER RESOURCE BOARDS. AGRICULTURAL DISCHARGE PROGRAM AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S I'M LAKE CONSTRAIN BAD AGREEMENTS. AND THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE IN THE OWNERS NATURE OF THOSE ARE INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING FOR MOST OF THESE SMALL SCALE OUTDOOR IMMENSELY TIER ONE FARMERS ONCE YOU ENCLOSE CULTIVATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO THOSE REGULATIONS SO INDOOR CULTIVATORS ULTIMATELY BEING IN IN CLOSE I MEAN ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THOSE REGULATIONS WE HAVE DIFFERENT REGULATORY NEEDS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND THE RESEARCH IS DIFFERENT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. AND SO. INSURED MAYBE I JUST WANT ALSO MENTION THAT. THE CULTIVATION THAT HAPPENING TEN SECOND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THINGS YOU APOLOGIES FOR GOING OVER. IS AN ECONOMIC BACKBONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND UNLESS WE CAN STABILIZE THESE CULTIVATORS BY BRINGING THEM INTO A REGULATORY SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR THEM LONG TERM WE WILL LOSE THAT ECONOMIC BACKBONE. WE WILL LOSE THESE FARMERS AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME. TO DISCUSS THIS BILL ON THE NEED FOR IT TODAY THINKING OF GREAT ANY ADDITIONAL ME TO USE. JUST ABOUT REALLY QUICK MOMENT BEEN OUT THE NIGHT KIND AS BUSINESS ALLIANCE PERCENT MEAN HOWEVER HUNDRED DISPENSARIES HIGH. THEY NEED WE WE NEED A COMMISSION AND WHERE COMPLIANCE WE. WANT WE HAVE THEIR FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS AND WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WE NEED TO STATUS RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR OUTSIDE GROWERS. AND THIS IS THE BILL THEY HAVE YOU CAN SEE I THINK ANY ADDITIONAL ME TO USE. PLEASE. HI AM PRECISE HE'S SENT ME TO. THE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE UNIT INTERNATIONAL CANNABIS FARMERS ASSOCIATION HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE REGARDING THE STRUCTURE THE INTENT IN THE PURPOSE OF AN AGRICULTURAL COMMISSION.

WHICH MILLER AMERICAN ALLIANCE FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS AND SUPPORT WE NEED THE CULTIVARS. TO BE PROTECTED FOR THE PATIENTS IN THE STATE THANK YOU. WARDING HER HAPPY MEMBERS SAID JASON BRIGHT CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A COMMISSION. WOULD DO HAVE MEMBERS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TIMING THIS BILL SO WE ARE IN FACT NEUTRAL AB APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEN ON ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SEE NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEM NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIVING GIVES TO CLOSE OFF YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY IN IN HEARING ABOUT THE GREAT NEED. HERE WHAT I'M HEARING FROM DISPENSARIES IS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY RUNNING OUT OF CANNABIS THAT THE. CULTIVATORS OF CANNABIS ARE NOT NOT ABLE TO GET LICENSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DON'T KNOW HOW WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS THAT CULTIVATORS FARMERS. WANT TO BAND TOGETHER. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THROUGH THIS REGULATORY PROCESS AND BE ABLE TO LIFT THEMSELVES OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE AND OUT OF THE BLACK MARKET. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXISTING AND FOUR OUT FOR THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE CREATED AYE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE NEED TO AS LAWMAKERS ASSIST THEM. TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE LEGALLY. AND IF AND IF THEY ARE ASKING US TO HELP THEM OPERATE LEGALLY A WE REALLY MUST REACH OUT BACK TO THEM. TWO OUT TO HELP LIFT THEM UP I RATHER THAN PUTTING A FAMILY FARMS OUT OF BUSINESS AND HURTING THE LOCAL ECONOMIES ORDER. PUSHING THEM FURTHER INTO THE SHADOWS AND CONTINUING. WHAT WAS A MARKETPLACE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE AND BRING BACK OUT BRING INTO A SYSTEM WERE ABLE TO TAX IT AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE SAFE? THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I HOPE TO BRING THIS BACK TO YOU SOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER NINE WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU AND MYSELF AND SO I'LL JOIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AT THE PODIUM AND HAND THIS OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR GOOD MORNING. TO THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT. WHICH WOULD HELP TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING AND LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE MY JOINT AUTHOR AS WELL AS HIS STAFF FOR HIT THEIR EXPENSIVE WORK WITH THAT WITH OUR OFFICE. IN OUR STATE AT THIS TIME ALMOST EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE CLOSE TO ONE IN THREE ADULTS HAVE AN ARREST OR CONVICTION RECORD. AND OUR STATE HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RECIDIVISM RATES IN OUR COUNTRY. ONE OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF RECIDIVISM. ARE THE EXTRA EXTENSIVE CHALLENGES THAT FACE EX OFFENDERS TO GET A JOB UPON REENTRY. SPIKE BAN THE BOX POLICIES. AT THE SAME TIME NEARLY THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL OF OUR STATES JOBS REQUIRE A LICENSE A CERTIFICATE WORD APPROVAL BY OVERSIGHT BOARD OR AGENCY FOR ALMOST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS. WHAT THIS MEANS IS EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS WHEN SEEKING A LICENSE TO WORK? QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS WERE DENIED A LICENSE EVEN THOUGH THE PRIOR ARREST FOR CONVICTION IS OLD. UNRELATED TO THE JOB OR OTHERWISE DISMISSED BY THE COURTS. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO ESTABLISH LICENSING THAT GIVES THESE CALIFORNIANS A FAIR CHANCE AS IS THE CASE IN A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES. BY PROHIBITING THE DENIAL REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF A LICENSE ON THE BASIS OF A NON VIOLENT CONVICTION THAT IS OLDER THAN FIVE YEARS. OR DISMISS CONVICTION OR A NON CONVICTION ACT UNLESS IT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE DUTIES OF THE PROFESSION FOR WHICH THE APPLICATION IS MADE. FOR ALL LICENSES UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS WHICH REGULATES ALMOST FORTY MAJOR PORTS OR BUREAUS. OUR BILL WOULD REQUIRE PORTS TO COLLECT AND PUBLISH DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ABOUT WHO IS DENIED A LICENSE OR IS HAD A LICENSE REVOKED OR SUSPENDED. THIS BILL ALSO PROHIBITS BOARDS FROM ACQUIRING AN APPLICANT TO SELF DISCLOSE CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION THAT CAN ALREADY BE OBTAINED THROUGH DOJ BACKGROUND CHECKS. LET ME KNOW THAT ARE BILL REFERENCES THE TWENTY THREE CRIMES THAT ARE CONSIDERED VIOLENT UNDER STATE LAW AND WOULD BE ABLE TO BE CONSIDERED BY A LICENSING BOARD. IF THE INTENT OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS REHABILITATION WE NEED TO WALK THE WALK WE CAN'T SAY WE WANT TO REHABILITATE INDIVIDUALS AND THEN BLOCK THEM FROM ACCESSING JOBS WHEN RELEASED. WHICH IN TURN LEADS TO MORE RECIDIVISM AND MORE CRIME WITH THAT LIKE TO TURN OVER TO OUR JOINT AUTHORS MR LA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR AND FOR ALLOWING A ASSEMBLY WHICH UNITED JOINT AUTHORED THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WHICH FOCUSES ON THE EFFORTS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT WE PROVIDE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO. GET BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SET UP A FRAMEWORK AND WHICH RECESS ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE SET UP FOR SUCCESS AN OPERA. IN THIS SCENE CHO THE CELLS MUCH OF THAT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. LET'S TURN OVER TO OUR WITNESSES FROM THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER AND LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN. JAIL. OTHER GOOD EVENING OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHAIR AND AND OTHERS. WE THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL TODAY I'M MY NAME'S JOHN MAYER COME WITH THESE MAKE ME LOS INNER AND WE WORK WITH OUR CLIENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS. WHO HAVE? CRIMINAL RECORDS AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER THEY'VE MOVED ON FROM THEIR PAST AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON THE GROUND OF. TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS THAT THE CURRENT LIE LICENSING LAWS AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOCK THEM. OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IN MANY CASES EVEN IF THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND ARE SUCCESSFUL W. RESTRICTED LICENSE WHICH WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY GET A JOB. IN THAT FIELD. ANOTHER CASES. THEY ACTUALLY WON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS BECAUSE YOU NEED HELP FROM AN ATTORNEY UP IN MANY CASES TO NAVIGATE THIS STUFF. SO. THAT'S WERE SEEN ON THE GROUND I'M WERE ALSO SING THE DATA THIS BILL IS BASED ON DATA. WHAT THE DATA SHOWS US NATIONAL PLAN ALLOW PRO PROJECT A COUPLE YEARS AGO? FOUND OUT THAT BASICALLY AFTER SIX YEARS. AFTER SOMEONE'S BEEN. OUT THERE LESS LIKELY THERE'D THERE'D JUST ABOUT THE ONLY MARGINALLY MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT A CRIME THAT ANYONE WITH NO CRIMINAL RECORD AT ALL I'M WE ALSO FOUND. THAT ACCORDING TO ARIZONA STATE. UNIVERSITY STUDY THAT STATES THAT HAVE. LICENSING POLICIES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE ARM COMES OUR STATE RIGHT NOW THAT HAVE LICENSE BECAUSE WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A NINE PERCENT HIGHER RECIDIVISM RATES. AND THOSE WHO HAVE A LIFE AND POLICIES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE CRITICAL CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS HAVE A TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT LOWER RATE EACH YEAR SO. DATA SHOWS US THAT THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE SHOULD BE GOING AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM MOST PC WILL SHARE SOME MORE STORIES GOOD MORNING I'M EVER DALLAIRE STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH CHILDREN. WE DO CLINICS ONE DAY CLINICS HELPING PEOPLE CLEAR THEIR RECORDS ALL OVER THE STATE AND I MEET CLIENTS REGULARLY WORKING TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEIR. STE THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN THESE CLIENTS WANT JOBS IN ORDER TO GET. WHAT JOB IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES IN THOSE JOBS REQUIRE AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE? CURRENTLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL CLIENTS WE CAN CLEAR THEIR RECORD BUT THOSE SPORTS OFTEN STILL CONSIDERING TONIGHT PEOPLE BASED ON DISMISSED CONVICTIONS. I WAS IN THE FRESNO RECENTLY WORKING ON OF. A CLINIC AND I WAS WORKING WITH A CLIENT WHO IS A YOUNG MAN HE WAS STILL IN COLLEGE AND HE WANTS TO DO PASSED CONTROL A JOB THAT REQUIRES AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE. AND SO ALTHOUGH HIS RECORD HAD IN FACT ALREADY BEEN CLEARED HE WAS COMING BACK TO SEE IF THERE WAS A WAY TO CLEAR IT SO THAT HE COULD GET THAT OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE. I'D LIKE THIS BILL TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT HIM AND I'M GETTING A JOB THAT WILL SUPPORT HIM AND. YOU KNOW SOMEDAY HIS FAMILY SIMILARLY I WORKED WITH A WOMAN WHO HAS A CALLING TO BE A PRACTICING NURSE. AND SHE HAD TO FIGHT FOR TWO DECADES IN ORDER TO LIVE THAT. LIVE THAT CALL AND TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE AGAIN BECAUSE OF A PRIOR CONVICTION AND THE LICENSING RESTRICTIONS. I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT ONE MORE JUST REALLY QUICKLY I'VE. WORKED WITH A MAN WHO. WAS HIRED AS A LOS PREVENTS PREVENTION OFFICER. BUT BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET THE LICENSE THAT COMPANY KEPT HIM IN TRAINING STATUS SO HE WAS MAKING SEVERAL DOLLARS LESS PER HOUR THAN OTHER PEOPLE DOING THE EXACT SAME WORK. AND THAT COMPANY HE COULDN'T GET THE LICENSE BECAUSE OF A CONVICTION HISTORY. US OF THOSE. AT OUR CLINICS PEOPLE WHO. DISPROPORTIONATELY HAVE BEEN IN JAIL OR ON PROBATION I JUST WANNA ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE MANY PROGRAMS IN THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM THAT IS OUR TRAINING PEOPLE TO DO THESE JOBS THAT LATER REQUIRE. AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE THIS IS FROM CDC OURS WEBSITE THEIR REENTRY PROGRAMS INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY CARPENTRY DRYWALL MASONRY PLUMBING INDUSTRIAL PAINTING ELECTRONIC ELECTRICAL. CONSTRUCTION COSMETOLOGY MACHINE SHOP HEATING VENTILATION AIR CONDITIONING REFRIGERATION SHEET METAL WELDING ELECTRONICS NETWORK CABLING ROOFING SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPE DESIGN. OFFICE SERVICES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES COMPUTER ILLITERACY AUTO MECHANICS ENGINE SERVICE AND REPAIR SMALL ENGINE REPAIR REPAIR AUTOMOTIVE BODY REPAIR AND REST FINISHING. I I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE DOING THIS WORK ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A FAIR CHANCE AT CAREERS AND WE NEED TO FIX THESE RULES SO PEOPLE CAN APPLY AND BE HIRED. FOR JOBS THAT THEY'RE QUALIFIED. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THEY DO OFTEN ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN SPORT.

IN FACT OUR ASSOCIATIONS ARE AND SOME OF THEIR. MEMBERS. WORK WITH CDC ARE ON PRE APPRENTICESHIP IN CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO PREPARE OFFENDERS FOR RE ENTRY INTO THE CONSTRUCTION FIELD. HOWEVER ARMED OPPOSITION STEMS FROM A BELIEF THAT IN THE CASE OF CONTRACTORS THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD IS DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB. OF OF THEIR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND THE SECOND IS TO ALLOW NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE CONSTRUCTION FIELD AND AS HOME IMPROVEMENT SALES PERSONS. THEIR OWN RECORDS INDICATE A THAT AND ONLY ABOUT ONE PERCENT. OF POSITIVE HITS FOR CRIMINAL RECORD A RESULT IN A OF AN APPLICANT A FAILING TO RECEIVE THEIR LICENSE SO NINETY NINE PERCENT. OF THOSE. APPLICANTS THAT DO HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD WHO APPLIED TO CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD ARE BEING LICENSED OR. IT POTENTIALLY A A CONDITIONAL LICENSE. SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT. THIS BILL IS A KIND OF A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FORTY DIFFERENT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT ARE ALL UNDER THE PART OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. IT WOULD TAKE AN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELL BOTH FOR THE CONTRACTOR COMMUNITY THE CONSUMERS AND THE OFFENDERS WHO ARE APPLYING FOR A LICENSE. AND REPLACING IT WITH A A NEW SYSTEM. AT COST TO THE STATE. AND A POTENTIALLY A DELAY IN AS THEY IMPLEMENT THIS AND I GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE NEW PROGRAMS TO EVALUATE THE RECORDS. THEY HAVE A STAFF THAT IS DEDICATED A TO REVIEWING OF THE APPLICANTS OTHER COME BACK WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD A AND WE THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING A AN EXCELLENT JOB FOR THAT REASON WERE OPPOSED. THANK YOU DISH AWARENESS IS OPPOSITION. SEEING NOT BRING THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. MS BAKER THANK YOU AND THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL I THINK. JUSTICE COMMITTEE LAST WEEKEND PART TIME TO REALLY LOOK FOR WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BE. ENSURING THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT TOO MANY BARRIERS TO CAREER PATHWAYS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WANT TO BEGIN AGAIN. AND. FOR WHOM WE NEED THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING MANY MORE PEOPLE RETIRE AND LEAVE THE WORK. SO HERE'S THE THING THAT WE WE DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR TO THE OTHER SIDE SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT PROVISIONS THE BILL HELP ME DECIPHER GOING. WHERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING IF IT'S TOO FAR ONE IS I KNOW THAT IN ORDER FOR THE BOARD MY WENT OVER SIMPLIFIED AND YOU THIS BILL TO BE ABLE TO DENY? LICENSE APPLICATION BASED ON A CONVICTION IT NEEDS TO BE A CONVICTION IS TO BE RELATED. TO THE JOB FOR WHICH THEY ARE REQUESTING LICENSE OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THAT. DOES PERJURY FALL INTO THAT. I WOULD ASSUME THAT IF LINE. IN A IN THE BUSINESS CONTEXT IS RELEVANT TO THE PROFESSION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CLINTON. AND THAT WOULD BE UP TO EACH BOARD TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION IT'S UNDER THE AUTHORITY THE BOARD TO DECIDE WHAT TEMPLE LAWS WOULD BE PERMITTED EN MI READ OF IT WAS THAT PERJURY. IT'S IT'S QUESTIONABLE EXPERTS QUESTION AND I WOULD THINK THAT PERJURY IS ONE THAT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE EXPLICIT THAT THE BOARD. CAN MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND THAT'S WET POPPED OUT IN MY MIND RIGHT AWAY AND IF IF YOU'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE BILL THAT WOULD BE ONE THING. ABSOLUTELY LOOK AT. AND THE OTHER IS VIOLENT FELONY. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU HAVE ADOPTING SOME OF THE STATUTES. IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY YOU'RE NOT REWRITING THE LIST YOU'RE ADOPTING OTHER PROVISIONS. TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY FIVE DEFINITIONS OF VIOLENT FELONY WHICH I REPEATEDLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BECAUSE IT LEAVES OUT. SOME. CRIMES THAT ARE NOT FELONIES ARE MISDEMEANORS INCLUDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VIOLATING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. AND IF WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME TO BE LICENSED IN AN AREA WHERE. YOU YOU ARE REPEATEDLY VIOLATING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER I THINK THAT SHE SOMETHING THE BOARD SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONSIDERING EVEN HAVE AS A BASIS FOR. FOR SAYING NO YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT THERE YET YOU NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS LICENSE BUT. THEY'RE NOT CONSIDERED VIOLENT FELONIES UNDER OUR LAWS SOMETIMES. THREATS OF ASSAULT TO A PEACE OFFICER ALSO ARE NOT CONSIDERED VIOLENT FELONIES. AND SO THAT WAS CAN OFTEN BE TOO NARROW A LIST I HAVE FOUND IN CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S TOO NARROW WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT. MANY OF OUR LAWS ARE SAYING WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE THE BASIS IT SOUNDS VERY GOOD AND I'M I'M SURE THAT'S HOW YOU DOING THIS BUT IT OFTEN SOUNDS GET FOLKS TO SAY. I WE'RE MAKING SURE THE VIOLENT FELONIES ARE PROTECTED. THAT'S OFTEN A WEAKNESS IN THE SECOND ONE IS IS IS IT A FELONY FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S STATE. SO LET'S SAY SOMEBODY COMES TO CALIFORNIA APPLIES FOR A LICENSE AND SOMETHING IS A VIOLENT FELONY IN ANOTHER STATE BUT ISN'T A VIOLENT FELONY HERE. AND I'D I WOULD LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE TIME THE. HANDS OF THE LICENSE BOARDS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS AND. IT MAY I I MAY NOT HAVE READ IT CAREFULLY BUT I DIDN'T POP OUT TO ME. AND THEN WHY FIVE YEARS FIVE YEARS SEEMS PARTICULARLY. THIS. A SHORT TIME PERIOD YOU KNOW BECAUSE ADULTS HAVE A A LIFE OF. BEHAVIOR THAT WE CARRY WITH US. WHAT BROUGHT YOU TO THE CONCLUSION OF FIVE YEARS BEING THE CUT OFF BECAUSE FOR ME THAT'S THE DEBATE ON THE NARROW SIDE PARTICULAR BECAUSE? WITH SOME OF THE PRESSURE PROGRAMS TAKES UP TO THREE YEARS AND SOME OF THE OTHER TRAINING AND SO SOMEONE TO BE IN A TRADE FOR FIVE YEARS FAIRLY NEW TO IT AND THEIR CONVICTION IS. SO WE WERE TRIED STRUCK A BALANCE IN THIS BILL. ON THE ONE HAND. WE THOUGHT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO APPLY FOR A LICENSE RIGHT AFTER CONVICTION THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE RIGHT THAT WOULD BE THE ZERO MARK. ON THE OTHER HAND. THE LONGER WE WAIT WERE TALKING AGAIN ABOUT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS ONE OUT OF THREE ADULTS WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM ALMOST THIRTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA JOBS THAT'S. CHALLENGE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS FIVE YEARS FELT LIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE TO US. I KNOW UNDER. UNDER SOME STANDARDS. DOJ. BACKGROUND CHECKS AND OTHERS IT'S MORE OF A SEVEN YEAR STANDARD I'M OPEN TO CONVERSATION THE COMEDIAN ALSO SUGGEST THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING FOR US TO DISCUSS BUT. BUT I THINK FIVE YEARS FEELS LIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE AFTER SOMEONE'S BEEN CONVICTED TO. OF HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AYE AND DURING THAT TIME PERIOD IF THEY HAVE IT RE OFFENDED. AND THERE'S NOT A SUBSEQUENT CONVICTION I THINK THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS OUGHT TO TO HAVE A CHANCE AND SO IT IT IT IS A ADMITTEDLY BALLOTS BUT. IS ONE THAT SEEM TEMP TO MAKE SENSE IF THE GOAL OF OUR SYSTEM IS TO TRY TO PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM RE OFFENDING. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS LET'S GIVE THEM A JOBLESS GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A LICENSE TO HAVE A JOB YOU WANNA TAKE A MOMENT AND AND? AND. ADDRESS YOUR ISSUE AROUND THE DEFINITION OF OF VIOLENT CRIMES YES WE DIDN'T WANT THIS BILL TO BE THE SUBJECT OF A DEBATE ON WHAT IS IN THAT CATEGORY AND NOT SO. THIS BILL SIMPLY REFERENCES THE DEFINITION OF WHAT UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE IS CONSIDERED A A VIOLENT CRIME. APPRECIATE THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE IN THAT CATEGORY. BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THAT MADE SENSE WE WE DON'T WANT TO RE LITIGATE THAT ISSUE HERE AND I THINK I AM BECAUSE IT'S VIOLENT FELONY. THERE ARE BUILT THEIR VIOLENT CRIMES AND OTHER VIOLENT JUST FELONIES AND SO THAT WOULD BE ONE AREA THAT I'M AYE WE CONSIDER THEIR MANY AREAS THAT ARE NOW MISDEMEANORS THAT ARE WORTH LOOKING AT. I'M AND FINALLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT HELPFUL ANSWER THERE'S ONE MORE POINT THAT SEEMS TO BE IT IS IN DISPUTE HAVE WE HEARD FROM OPPOSITION THAT NINETY NINE PERCENT. OF THOSE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR THESE LICENSES ARE GETTING THEM REGARDLESS OF PRIOR. FELONY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND COOPER CONVICTION THAT'S ONE PERCENT THAT'S A FAIRLY NARROW MOUNTAIN THAT THE THE BOARD YOU DOING A GOOD JOB. YOU JUST PRESENTED THE INFORMATION AND I MAY HAVE HEARD AROUND ONE IN THREE OR EIGHT MILLION ARE NOT GETTING. OR MAYBE COULD STATE AGAIN ARE NOT GETTING A LICENSE FOR IT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SOURCES ARE ON IT BUT. I'VE HAD CONTRACTORS EMPLOYERS IN MY BUSINESS IN HER MY DISTRICT COME TO ME AND SAY WE WE ARE. AGGRESSIVELY LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE REBUILDING THEIR LIVES BECAUSE WE NEED THE WORK FORCE AND I'M NOT SEEN. THE DENIALS AS MUCH IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE STUDENTS TO STATISTICS THAT SEEM TO BE COMPLETELY CONTRARY. BECAUSE IT HELPS US GET A SENSE OF HOW MUCH IS THERE REALLY A PROBLEM SO LET ME LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THE STATISTICS THAT I REFERENCED SO WHERE ST ALMOST EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS. EITHER BEEN ARRESTED OR CONVICTED SO THAT'S THE POPULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THEN THERE ARE THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL CALIFORNIA JOBS REQUIRE A LICENSE OR CERTIFICATE SO THAT'S THE UNIVERSE OF FOLKS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE DENIED ACCESS TO LICENSE NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE. IN PART BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THIS DATA AND ONE ASPECT OF THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY COLLECT THE STATUS OF THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS. BUT I CAN TELL YOU AND ASSURE YOU THAT THE MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS ARE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE. THEY ARE CONNECTED WITH THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNABLE TO TO ACCESS THESE OCCUPATIONS BECAUSE OF THIS LICENSE ONE FINAL THING I'LL JUST MENTION IS. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IF YOU VISIT THEIR WEBSITE IT LIST TWENTY CAREER OR TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS PROVIDED TO PRISONERS FOLKS IN OUR SYSTEM. BUT IRONICALLY MOST OF THESE VERY PROGRAMS ONCE YOU GET OUT OF PRISON YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY APPLY FOR. A LICENSE IN THAT PROFESSION STRUCTURE IN COSMETOLOGY AUTO REPAIR EXCEPT TRUCK BECAUSE OF THE VERY SITUATION WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW SO WE'VE WE SET UP OUR CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM HOPEFULLY TRAIN FOLKS. TO GET THESE JOBS AND THEN THEY COME OUT AND THEY CAN'T SO HE CAN'T APPLY FOR THEM AT ALL. ARE THEY ARE THEY MAY NOT GET A LICENSE THEY MAY NOT GET A LICENSE OP BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE DEFINITION OF WHAT THE SPORTS CAN LOOK AT IS VERY BROAD. SO THE REALLY NO STANDARDS AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS FOR THAT CATEGORY OF NON VIOLENT OFFENDERS WHOSE CONVICTION IS LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS. WE WANT TO GIVE THEM A SHOT AND WE THINK THAT THAT CATEGORY OUGHT TO OUGHT NOT BE LOOKED AT. AGAIN UNLESS THE CRIME FITS. AND IS RELATED TO THE PROFESSION I THINK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT'S HELPFUL I I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF TERRIFIC PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL PARTICULAR THE NEED FOR DATA. WHICH I THINK THIS. DISCUSSION UNDERSCORES AS WELL AS THE PRECISION ABOUT WHAT DATA WE HAVE IF IT'S THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING. DENIED AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR A LICENSE WHICH YOU JUST MENTIONED ARE NOT IT'S JUST WHAT IS REALLY CAUSING THE DENIAL SO THAT WE CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISE ABOUT IT. PARTICULAR BECAUSE THESE BOARDS ARE FOR CONSUMER SAFETY FOR ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FIRST AND FOREMOST NOT. RESTRICTING PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO THE FIELD I I I CAN'T GET THERE TODAY ON IT HERE BUT I HOPE I'VE GIVEN SOME SPECIFICS THAT ARE WHERE HOPEFULLY WOULD BE HELPFUL IS IF THE BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE. AND AND THAT WE CAN BE LOOKING FOR SOME OF THOSE AREAS THAT WE ALL AGREE ON THERE'S A LOT OF CONSENSUS. AND START THERE AND SEE IF IT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO GO AS BROAD AS I FEEL THE BILL GOES TODAY. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WORSE CHAIR ARMS CERTAINLY I WANT TO SAY THAT OF THIS IS EXCITING BILL TO ME. I REMEMBER WHEN. FORMER SPEAKER EMERITUS KAREN BASS WAS HERE AND SHE CARES IN THE PRE SELECTED SLASH BECAUSE PEOPLE WHICH WEREPRESENT. A WHO GET OUT OF JAIL OR PRISON. HAVE CERTAIN WAS DENIED SPECIALLY THOSE IN WAS TO. PURSUE A CAREER IN TERMS OF BORROWING CUTTING HERE IS A LEARNED THAT PARTICULAR TRADE AND CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THE FIVE YEAR I THINK THAT THAT SPEAKS TO. A PARTICULAR A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT THIS CAN REALLY HELP MOVING FORWARD. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL IN CERTAIN WILL ASKS IF I COULD BE A COAUTHOR OF THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT MAKES SENSE EXPRESS BUT AND. BUT AARON WHICH I REPRESENT BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED AND. CANNOT RECEIVE A LICENSE I WANT TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. THEY DO IT ON THE GROUND. AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE COME WE WANT WHEREBY DOES COME OUT OF SHADOWS WE WANT THEM TO COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS. AND BE ABLE TO DO IT IN THE RIGHT WAY. AND SO PAY THEIR TAXES. NOT HAVING TO HIDE. AND DO THE RIGHT THING TO PROVIDE A SERVICE AND WHEN THEY OPEN UP THEIR OWN BARBER SHOP AND SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO I KNOW PERSONALLY. WHO'LL BE X. CERTAIN EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE COST OF TO BRING HIS BILL AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE. BUT THERE'S A MOTION BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN EGGMAN AND A SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMAN CHEN. THIS YOU CHOOSE SHARE REFLECT CLOSE. I JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT. AGAIN WE'VE BEEN WORKING AND CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH PARTNERS CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND WANT TO THANK OUR SO OUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ENSURING THAT WE ARE IN CONTINUE DIALOGUE WITH THE BOARDS AND DCA. AND LET ME JUST SAY APPRECIATE THAT THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS HAVE JUST BEEN RAISED IN A LAST WEEK. THERE WAS A BILL ON THE OTHER SIDE THE AISLE THAT DID ALSO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS VERY SO TOPICS AROUND OUR LICENSING SYSTEM AND HOW WE CAN. MAKE IT EASIER FOR INDIVIDUALS PARTICULARLY WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GAINFULLY. RECEIVE SOME EMPLOYMENT THROUGH THAT SYSTEM AGAIN THE END OF THE DAY IF WE ALL ARE TRUE TO THE VALUE OF REHABILITATION WE NEED TO WALK THE WALK AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE. MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO'VE DONE THEIR TIME HAVE A CHANCE OF BEING ABLE TO REINTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY WITH MANY OF THESE PROFESSIONS AGAIN CLOSED EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PROFESSIONS THAT IN OUR STATE CURRENTLY REQUIRE A LICENSE. CERTIFICATE OR OTHER APPROVAL FROM AN OVERSIGHT BOARD WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. MOTION IS THE PAST APPROPRIATIONS LOW. LOW EYEBROW. BRUNO ARAMBULA. BAKER. BAKER NOW BLOOM. CHEN. CHIU.

AS YOU WILL RECALL. WE HAD CRAP PRESENTATION. LAST WEEK AND I IN RECOGNITION OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PRESENTATIONS OCCURRING. FEE MY BILL TO LIMIT SOME OF THAT. TESTIMONY SO THAT WE CAN FULLY ENGAGED AND FRUITFUL DIALOGUE SO HAVING SAID THAT ASSEMBLY OR MOMENT PLEASE PRESENT WHEN EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AS THE CHAIR INDICATED LAST WEEK I PERCENT AND IN FULL. THE MERITS OF AB THIRTY ONE TEN DO YOU AND DISCUSS MY TEN WITH THE BILL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH US ON AMENDMENTS. TO STRENGTHENING CLARIFY THE BILL OVER THE PAST WEEK I'M ACCEPTING ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS NOTED IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS. THE CHAIRS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS REMOVE THE PROVISIONS THAT IMPOSE LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND STATE CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR REGISTRATION AND TITLE PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS. FOR THE RECORD WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE DETAIL RELATED TO THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND WILL CONTINUE OUGHT TO BE BOB WORKING ON THOSE ISSUES GOING FORWARD. UPON APPROVAL OF THE BILL TODAY IN ESSENCE IT IS MY OPINION THAT A CONSUMER INJURED INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE WHERE TO SEEK TREATMENT. AND NOT BE LIMITED WITH CERTAIN OBVIOUS. NOT BE LIMITED WITH CERTAIN OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS AGAIN MY PRIMARY GOAL WITH A. B. THIRTY ONE TEN IS TO PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE. HEALTHCARE PROVIDER CERTIFIED AS HAVING COMPLETED TRAINING IN THE FIELD THAT THE CONSUMER HAS AN AGENCY TO CHECK THE CREDENTIALS AND HAVE A PLACE TO LODGE COMPLAINTS IF THEY RECEIVE POOR TREATMENT. NONE OF THAT EXISTS TODAY CALIFORNIA REMAINS AN OUTLINE AIR IN THIS REGARD AND WITH THAT LET ME SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. DID YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. A GOOD MORNING AND ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS MIKE JUST ARMED ATHLETIC TRAINERS PHYSICAL THERAPISTS IN HERE REPRESENTING THE. CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOCIATION. AND AS NOTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLINS I'M INTRODUCED A BILL THAT WOULD LICENSE AFFLECK TRAINERS. AND WE HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE CMA THE NC DOUBLE A NUMEROUS PHYSICIAN GROUPS A CIF PARENT ADVOCACY GROUPS. AND BUSINESSES. I BECAUSE. ALL THOSE ORGANIZATIONS FELT THAT IT HELP PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AND ALSO WOULD REMOVE THE LEGAL GRAY AREA THAT SURROUNDED THE PRACTICE OF ATHLETIC TRAINING. I'M AN INCREASE LIABILITY. FOR THOSE EMPLOYERS OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AND WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT LICENSURE THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHOD OF REGULATING THIS ALLIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSION. BUT IN SPITE OF THIS BELIEF CATIA'S HAS. MADE A MAJOR CONCESSION IS SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENTS DRAFTED BY COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE CHAIR WE APPRECIATE THE TIME AND EFFORT THAT THEY SPENT. ON THOUGHTFULLY DOING SO. AND WE ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT AND IT WOULD HELP PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AND PREVENT FUTURE IS HE'S FROM HAPPENING. AND WE DO HAVE IS NOTED SOME TECHNICAL AND CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT UP WITH THE AUTHOR WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND APPRECIATE THEIR COMMITMENTS. I'M TO ADDRESS THOSE. AND THE CA RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK SUPPORT. OKAY SEEM NOW MEMBER YES. I THINK YOU AYE MISTER CHAIR.

TO MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SIR KARL LONDON HERE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATIONAL TRY TO. KEEP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE CONSIDERING. A FIRST OF ALL YOU WANT I THINK YOUR STAFF. VINCE CHIEF FOR THE WORK YOU PUT ANY WAS. VERY TRANSPARENT WORKING WITH US WE APPRECIATE THAT. WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE. IN THE POSITION OF TRYING TO RE WRITE A BILL THIS CLOSE TO. HEARING DATE LIKE THIS BILL ACTUALLY IS EVEN REAL IMPRINT. AND SO WERE RESPONDING AS BEST WE CAN WITH THAT WE HAD ALL FALL WINTER THE FRONT END OF THE SPRING TO TALK TO THESE ISSUES. YET HERE WE ARE WRITING A BILL. THE SHORT A NOTICE. WE GET THE AMENDMENTS MONDAY MORNING. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THEM WE OVERALL STILL BELIEVE THAT. THE TITLE PROTECTION CERTIFICATION SCHEME IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO HANDLE THE ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED BY THE AUTHOR THE AUTHORS NOTED THAT HE'S INTERESTED IN. MAKING SURE THE ATHLETIC TRAINERS CAN TRAVEL SUPPORT THEIR TEAMS ATHLETES IN OF THE STATE'S. AND MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE IN CALIFORNIA WHO CALL THEMSELVES AN ATHLETIC TRAINER. UNLESS A PROPER CREDENTIALS A TITLE PROTECTION CERTIFICATION WOULD HANDLE THAT. ALSO NOTE. THIS BEEN SAID OVER OVER AGAIN THE WITH THE LAST THE TO REGULATE ATHLETIC TRAINERS THAT SON A SURLY TRUE WATER STATES DO HAVE. A TITLE PROTECTION CERTIFICATION SCHEME. I THAT USES THE NET CERTIFICATION PROCESS WHICH IS REALLY THE GOLD STANDARD IN PROFESSIONAL AND COLLEGE SPORTS ANYWAY. THE BILL AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE BELIEVE STILL HAVE A LOT OF HOLES. AS EXAMPLES OF JUST CITE A COUPLE AGAIN WE'RE DOING THIS ON SHORT NOTICE BUT IN SUBSECTION FOUR OF THE SECTION DEFINES THE SCOPE. THERE'S A SECTION THAT SAYS THE ACTIVITIES THAT AFFECT TRIGGERS ME BILL WILL DO IT SAYS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO. WE SEE THAT IS A VERY OPEN DOOR FOR ANY OTHER KIND OF ACTIVITY THEY WANT TO DO. THE PROTOCOL THAT'S REQUIRED AND IS A MEMBER STE WHEN A PHYSICIAN ATHLETIC TRAINER WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE TIED TO THE SPECIFIC ATHLETE. AND NOT WRITTEN AS THE GENERAL PROTOCOL AS IT APPEARS TO BE WHERE THE ATHLETIC TRAINER CAN OPERATE. UNDER ANY KIND OF. RELATIONSHIP THEY HAVE TO HAVE WITH THE PHYSICIAN. THE DEFINITION MATH ATHLETIC ACTIVITY STILL INCLUDES WHAT WE WOULD DESCRIBE AS THE RECREATIONAL ATHLETE. FOR WHOM NO PRE PARTICIPATION SCREENING A BASELINE IS REQUIRED ARE KNOWN. THE MEMBERS ALSO DO SOMETHING THAT I DON'T BELIEVE I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE WHICH IS ALLOWED THIS BOARD THIS CREATED. TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE PRIVATE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THE PROFESSION THAT IT'S INTENDED OVERSEE. AS SEEMS VERY ODD TO SEEMS AT A MINIMUM TO BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. AND. THE LAST THING WE SEE IS THE PRACTICE IN THIS BILL THAT'S BEEN DEFINED. SHOULDN'T BE ONLY ATTACHED ATHLETES IN SPORTS BUT TO ALSO INCLUDE WE BELIEVE SPORTS SETTINGS AND SPORTS VENUES. AGAIN WE'RE DOING THIS ON SHORT NOTICE WE DID AN EMERGENCY PHONE CALL US NOT TO DO THE BEST WE COULD BE RESPONSIVE. WE'RE. OPPOSING THIS BILL WHEN ASKED THIS BILL NOT BE MOVED FORWARD IN THE WE INSTEAD. DO THIS THROUGH A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH WE HAVE THE BILL IS NOW WHAT DID THESE THINGS THANK YOU.

BY THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST WHEN MR LONDON'S TESTIMONY. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN I CAN ALSO REPRESENT THAT. MY LEADERSHIP AT A A T. A N.

THOUGHT THAT THIS GROUP OF FOLK PROVIDERS WASN'T FOR. A PARAMOUNT TO A CONCERN TO ME SO I'M GLAD THAT. OF THAT YOU FOUND ANOTHER WAY TO. TO HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT FOR UP FOR THIS GROUP. I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS IS ALL HAPPENING AT THE LAST MINUTE AND. THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME LANGUAGE DISCREPANCIES WHICH IS KEEPING THE PANTIES IN THE OUT HE'S. FROM.

IT HAPPENS THAT WAY SOMETIMES IT'S NOT IDEAL BUT. I THINK WE DO HAVE A PATH FORWARD. SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED HERE AROUND THE FUNDS AND OUT SORT OF A UNIQUE STRUCTURE THERE. SHOULD THIS BILL GOING APPROPRIATIONS WILL CERTAINLY REVIEW ALL OF THOSE OUTSTANDING ISSUES SO THE GOAL HERE IS CONSUMER PROTECTION PROTECTING THE PUBLIC PROTECTING EMPLOYERS OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS. PROTECTING ATHLETIC TRAINERS THEMSELVES THIS IS IT LICENSURE THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANTED. ULTIMATELY. BUT I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC AND IT'S A BRIDGE I THINK ULTIMATELY TO LICENSURE BUT THAT WILL BE A A FULL CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER DAY BUT AT THIS POINT I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT. I'M PROUD TO STAND. BEHIND IT WITH THE ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS SOMEWHERE MULLIN AND TO ECHOES THE.
