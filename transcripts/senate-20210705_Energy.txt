IF THERE ARE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE CENTER GONZALEZ THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL WHEN APPROPRIATE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER CONTINUED WORK IN BROADBAND- OF COURSE ADVOCATING FOR ALL OF THE STATE BUT PARTICULARLY FOR COMMUNITIES IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND I MYSELF CARRYING THE BILL- AND I IN THE SENATE- IT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THESE TWO BILLS MOVING FORWARD WE KNOW THAT THIS IS ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY WE KEEP SAYING THIS BIKE. BYCHKOVA NINETEEN IT'S BEEN VERY VERY CLEAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS THE BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO INCREASE SPEEDS AND TO ENSURE THAT EVERY PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS- IS COVERED I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR HIS CONTINUED WORK HE'S BEEN LIKE A MENTOR TO ME FOR THEM THE BROADBAND SPACE IN HIS COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS AS WELL FOR THEIR CONTINUED WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT WILL GO TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO DISPERSE SAY THAT- TO THE AUTHOR AND BOTH AUTHORS ACTUALLY. THAT- I KNOW YOUR HEART I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING REALLY HARD TO TRY TO GET SOMETHING THAT. THE SILLY RUMOR I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SHE'S BEEN WORKING A DECADE I ONLY BEEN HERE NINE YEARS. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AS WELL SO I WANTED JUST. A MINUTE I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I WANT TO LAY OUT SOME REASONS WHY. I DON'T BELIEVE. WE'RE GOING TO GET. WHERE WE WANT TO GO. IN I KNOW THAT WHEN THE SENATOR HAD HER BILL UP I TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE. SAME SAME REASONS FIRST OFF I WANT TO SHARE. THAT ADDING MONEY TO THE POT ISN'T ALWAYS GONNA SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND I KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO PUT A LOT OF RESOURCES IN BUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT. CALIFORNIA IS A MAP OF WHO'S BEING SERED BY PRIVATE COMPANIES AND WHO'S NOT BEING SERVED AND I KNOW THAT THE SENATOR COPULAR OWES BILL. WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THAT IN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE ARE THAT. THE PRIVATE SIDE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GONNA SUPPORT OF AMENDED. BUT IN THE TIME I'VE BEEN HERE ONLY ONE COMPANY. HAS USED THE CAST OF FUNDS TO ACTUALLY EXTEND OUT. AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE FORCED TO IN AN ACQUISITION TO SUPPLY SERVICES. SO WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE A CAR IN CALIFORNIA IS BROADBAND WITH NO WHEELS ON IT WE CAN'T GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO. BUT WE CONTINUE TO PUT GAS IN IT AND ADD MORE GAS BUT IT'S NOT MOVING. WE HAVE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE- BUDGET POTENTIAL SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IT'S GOING TO BE SUPPOSE THE USED.FOR THE MIDDLE MILE. SO THAT'S LIKE A FREEWAY WITH BILL ON RAMPS OR OFF RAMPS WE CAN'T GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO. SO FOR ME THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT WE NEED TO SIT DOWN AND WE NEED TO SAY TO THAT WHERE DO WE HAVE PLACES THAT WE DON'T. HAVE SERVICE AND I HAVE A LOT OF THOSE PLACES. AND WE NEED TO SAY TO THE PRIVATE UTILITY. YOU'RE GOING TO HELP US GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO IN THIS CASE THEY WON'T TAKE THE CAST OF FUNDS. THEY DON'T USE. AND THE HISTORY WILL SHOW US THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE MONEY AGAIN. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET. WHERE WE WANT TO GO. INTEL WE PUT THE UTILITIES. THAT'S COMCAST EIGHTEEN T. VERIZON ALL THOSE PEOPLE ALONG WITH THE REGULATOR WHICH IS THE P. U. C. PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND THE LEGISLATOR IN A ROOM AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY DELIVER THE SERVICES IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE DOING THE SAME THING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS WHICH IS PUTTING MONEY IN THE SYSTEM. AND NOT GETTING DELIVERABLES OUT THE OTHER END SO THIS IS THE THIS IS TO THE POOR BILLS NOW PUT TOGETHER. THERE WAS. A TWO OTHER BUILDERS ANOTHER BILL COMING UP TODAY ON BROAD BANDS WE'VE GOT FOUR BILLS. TO THE LEGISLATURE TO RATHER SIMPLY TWO OUT OF THE SENATE I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING ANY OF THEM WE'RE GONNA BE UNTIL WE SIT DOWN AND ACTUALLY DO THE RIGHT THING WHICH IS. GET GOOD POLICY AND BASICALLY GET THE UTILITIES TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. NOW I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHICH YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT. THEY'RE C. TO EIGHTEEN EIGHTY HAS A- GIANT SIX LANE FREEWAY GOING RIGHT UP MY DISTRICT. OF BROADBAND AND I CANNOT TAP INTO IT BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE NOT TO. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY THERE. THESE CASTS OF FUNDS COULD HELP. PUT THE MONEY IN THE POT. TO GET THAT GET THAT SERVICES TO MY SCHOOLS TO MY TO MY LIBRARIES TO OUR BUSINESSES. BUT THEY CHOOSE NOT TO USE IT AND THAT GOES FOR ALL THE TEAMS I'M NOT JUST PICKING ON ONE THEY ALL DO IT BECAUSE THEIR- PROFIT CENTERS. THIS BILLS THIS MONEY SHOULD BE HELPING US GET THERE BUT IF THEY NEVER TAP INTO IT WE WON'T GET THERE. SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO FORCE THEM TO BE AT THE TABLE THE SAYS. WE'RE GOING TO GET THE SERVICES WITHOUT HAVING TO BUILD. A COMPLETE NEW NETWORK. AROUND THEM TO GET THERE THE CALL THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY. IN THE STATE TO EVER GET THERE SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WANT TO SAY AGAIN I RESPECT BOTH THE AUTHORS. I KNOW THEIR HEART I KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT THIS ISN'T GONNA GET WHAT WE WANT. IN MY OPINION. THANK YOU MR CHAIR OUR BOARD JUST. SURE I'D LIKE TO I COMMEND THE AUTHORS OFFER THE WORK THEY'RE DOING IN THE SPACE- I'VE DONE MY BEST TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ABSENCE OF BROADBAND IN- MY DISTRICT REPRESENTING ALL OR PARTS OF ELEVEN COUNTIES NATIONALLY I'M GONNA HAVE A LOT OF RURAL FOOTHILL AND MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES- THAT DO NOT HAVE SERVICE. I THINK WHAT I'VE LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC IS THAT AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. WHAT WE DEEM TO BE ESSENTIAL SERVICES SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS SUPPLY CHAIN FOOD WATER. AND OTHER TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PANDEMIC TAUGHT US THAT BROADBAND SHOULD NOW BE CONSIDERED. PART OF OUR CENTRAL PORTFOLIO. IT IF THAT IS THE CASE AS CALIFORNIA DEEMS IT TO BE. WITH OUR SURPLUS OF LET'S SAY SEVENTY FIVE AND IT'S A BIT OF A MOVING TARGET STILL. THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING MORE STATE INVESTMENT INTO THIS NINE OH SEVEN BILLION IS NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT. IF THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT IS MOVING FORWARD RIGHT NOW. HI I APPLAUD THE INVESTMENT IN THE MIDDLE MILE IN OTHER IN- IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BUT THAT FINAL MILE. NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE EQUATION. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THESE RURAL AREAS I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR REPRESENTS A NUMBER OF THEM HERSELF- I DON'T BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE A SURCHARGE TO BE ABLE TO PUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS FORWARD THERE SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD BE USING GENERAL FUND MONEY TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT NOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF VARIATIONS THAT COULD TAKE PLACE WITH A SURCHARGE WHETHER IT BE A STATE GUARANTEE OR THE SURCHARGE IS SATISFIED BY THE STATE COMMITMENTS- IN MAYBE DOWN THE ROAD MAINTENANCE COULD BE- BORNE BY THOSE ACCOUNT HOLDERS. BUT I THINK THIS IS A STRONG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THE FUNDING MECHANISM I THINK IS MISPLACED GIVEN HOW WE HAVE STATED BOTH AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL AS WELL AS LEGISLATIVE LEVEL THAT IF THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE CENTRAL SERVICE WE NEED TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS A GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT AND I KNOW THERE ARE POLITICAL CURRENTS AND CROSS CURRENTS THAT MAY- DISCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENT BUT THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. VERY WELL- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE DO HAVE- GOING EXCEPT CENTER GONZALEZ MOTION NOW ON THE BILL THAT INCLUDES AMENDMENTS AND I BELIEVE THAT IN THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS MINISTER FOR CEMENT AND RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. WILL BE SEEN ANOTHER COMMITTEE AND IN THE INTERIM I KNOW- THE AUTHORS EXPRESSED INTEREST TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW WE ARE WORKING ON NOT ONLY SEVERAL BILLS BUT SOME BUDGET ITEMS THAT MAY PERTAIN TO THIS SO HOW WE STRUCTURE THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE SHARED TODAY. IN TERMS OF THAT IN SOME STATE FUNDS INTO THIS INITIATIVE AND I THINK GENERALLY THEY SHOULD COVER THE CONNECTIONS FROM THE MIDDLE MILE TO OUR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES AND THIS FUND COURSE I BELIEVE REALLY NEEDS A GIRL THAT THE MONEY HAS BEEN UTILIZED SUCCESSFULLY PASS AND ALL WE CAN DO IT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A STRATEGY AND WE'RE WORKING ON IMPROVING ON THAT STRATEGY AS WE SPEAK. SO I WANT TO ASK THE- AUTHOR TO MAKE SOME CLOSING REMARKS FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE IF NOT WE HAVE RAGE ABOUT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND I DO WANT TO CLARIFICATIONS FOR SENATOR DOLLY. AT FOURTEEN EXPANDS WHO CAN USE CAN THE CASTLE TO MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE I AGREE WITH YOU THAT AT THE FIRST TIME WE DID SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE THERE WERE SOME BUMPS IN THE ROAD YOU KNOW IF WE COULD DO PERFECT- LEGISLATION EVERY SINGLE TIME I STOOD UP HERE THAT THE ONE THING BUT ONE OF MY GOALS IS TO MAKE SURE WE DO A VERY GOOD- FRAMEWORK AND. THE SENATOR AND I HAVE WORKED. FOR HOURS AND DAYS AND HALF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD A GOOD FRAMEWORK TO GO AHEAD. YOU KNOW I WANT TO JUST REMIND YOU THAT DOES BENEFIT THE RURAL AREAS. YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHERE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SATISFY THOUGH BUT ALSO AS SENATOR GONZALES WILL TELL YOU. THAT HER URBAN AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY. THE BILL PER PRIORITIZES RURAL AREAS. OFF THE TERROR ONLY AT TEN ONE SERVICE THAT PROVIDES BROADBAND AND AREAS I. S. P.'S- TYPICALLY SERVE. MONEY FOR THEM WITH LITTLE RETURN. IN THE BILL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GPAS TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS COOPS CAN ACCESS THE CAPS OF FUNDS TO BUILD BROADBAND I'M MAKING THIS LOCAL REGIONAL APPROACH AS YOU KNOW IN YOUR DISCIPLINE THIS HAS ONE OF THE BEST SYSTEMS AND I REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD MIRROR WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND WE WANT THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. END USERS WILL FIND THE SURCHARGE RATE. TO DIG DEEP FREEZE. SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT THIS IS LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD IS THE MAX WE CAN COLLECT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IT WILL BE USE VERY- STRATEGICALLY- IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S STRATEGIC PLAN FOR BROADBAND. I WOULD THINK- I THINK MY VEHICLE. AUTHOR MRS- GETS ALL THIS AND I CAN AGREE THAT A LOT OF THE STUFF IS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT'S IN OUR BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FORWARD ON THAT AND WE HAVE SUGGESTIONS EVEN MAKE THAT BETTER. SO I CAN I KNOW YOUR CONCERN I KNOW THAT- WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE A POINT. ABOUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT WE CANNOT GO ON. ANY LONGER WITHOUT HAVING CONNECT CONNECTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR I WILL. VERY WELL THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION- SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AP FOURTEEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUILAR CURRY THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST THE MEN'S AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. WESSEL HI WESSEL HI DOLLY. TALLY KNOWN BETTER BY BECKER HI. FORTUS BRADFORD ALL RIGHT BRADFORD HI DOT. THE FIRM HI. FIGMENT HI AIKMAN HI CONTROLLERS HI CONSOL IS FINE GROSS. HERTZBERG REQUIRE. MAN WELL I MAN HI RUBIO. RUBIO HI STERN HI STERN I IT. IT'S WEDNESDAY IT'S BETTER THE BILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT WILL KEEP THE ROLE OF THE PROPS OF MEMBERS THANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS A TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR VOTES EXCELLENT WORK WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO FOLLOW THE NUMBER TWO A. B. FORTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOOD RELATED TO BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT. WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GENERATE SO WHEN MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE OF THE MYRIAD OF WAYS IN WHICH THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AS MANIFESTED ITSELF THROUGHOUT OUR STATE THIS PAST YEAR. WHETHER IT IS EDUCATION THE DIGITAL MARKETPLACE HEALTH CARE OR ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT SERVICES. THE GATEWAY TO FUNDAMENTAL RESOURCES IS INCREASINGLY ONLINE. THE PROPOSALS I PUT FORTH IN AB FORTY ONE OUR BASELINE STEPS WE MUST TAKE TO BRING ALIFORNIA'S DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. IT'S TAKING OFFICE COMMON SENSE EXPANSION OF BROADBAND ACCESS HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF MINE. I'M EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO BRING THAT WORKING KNOWLEDGE TO THE TABLE AS WE COLLABORATE BY CAMERON LEE AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE CONCEPT OF DIG ONCE IS NOT A NEW POLICY AREA FOR ME I'M BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE MY COLLEAGUES AGAIN. BECAUSE% UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF OUR STATE AGENCIES DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY WITH WHICH WE MUST ROLL OUT BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. AS SIMPLY AS WE UPGRADE OUR STATE ROADWAYS WE NEED TO DETERMINE HOW. NOT IF BROADBAND IS A PART OF THAT IMMINENT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT. I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY THAN TO LAY CONDUIT- WHEN WE HAVE THE GROUND ALREADY OPENED UP. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MIDDLE MILE DEPLOYMENT WHICH IS EXCITING. BUT THEN WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAXIMIZE COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK IF WE GET BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT. YEAH AND PLANNED ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES IN SYNC. I'M ASKING FOR SOME SIMPLE PLANNING BY OUR STATE AGENCIES WHICH CAN REDUCE THE COST OF DEPLOYMENT BY UP HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION. SIMILARLY I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR CURRENT BROADBAND SERVICE MAPS ARE WOEFULLY LACKING IN DETAIL. THEY LEAVE PEOPLE DISCONNECTED AND FRUSTRATED BY CRUDELY MARKING BASS CENSUS BLOCKS SERVED. AND UNSERVED SOMETIMES BASED ON A SINGLE HOUSEHOLD. I GREW INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED AS WE CONTINUE DISCUSSING ACCESS TO STATE GRANTS AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT BASED ON MAPS THAT ARE FLAT WRONG. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS COOPERATIVES AND MANY OTHERS ARE EAGER TO GET ONLINE. THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS TO GIVE THEM AN ACCURATE MAP. THAT ACTUALLY CAPTURES THE PROBLEM IN THEIR COMMUNITY THEY ARE WORKING TO SOLVE. I'M CONFIDENT THE C. P. C. C. P. U. C. HAS THE DATA WE SIMPLY NEED TO PRESENT. IT IN A WAY THAT GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE POWER TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY LIKE MANY OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY DONE. WE WORKED WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT I BELIEVE REFINE AND PRESERVE THE SPIRIT OF THIS BILL. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THEIR TIME. AND THEY DO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS. YOUR EXPERTISE IN THIS ISSUE. I KNOW THEY ARE HIS PASSIONS I AM ABOUT GETTING CALIFORNIA'S ONLINE. MULTI MILLIONAIRE PROPOSAL SIMPLE FIRST LET'S BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR CURRENT BROADBAND NEEDS AND LET'S USE A LITTLE FORESIGHT. WHEN CALTRANS BREAKS GROUND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT.

PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO ACCESS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE WHAT WHAT IS AROUND THEM HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT CURRENTLY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THE MAPS ARE NOW INACCURATE. AS I SAID IN MY STATEMENT- YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE A ONE PERSON HAVING SERVICE IN A CENSUS BLOCK AND THAT WOULD- THAT WOULD THAT WOULD SHOW THAT THAT AREA IS SERVED AND THAT'S REALLY NOT SERVED QUITE FRANKLY IN MY OPINION. SO WE'RE RYING TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE- INTERESTED PARTIES THAT ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BUILD OUT INTERNET ACCESS CAN GET THE DATA THEY NEED. TO SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY THERE- AND WHAT OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT BE TO COLLABORATE WITH THE CURRENT PROVIDERS. THANK YOU THEY CANNOT TIME. DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. OKAY I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE- WE HAVE A MOTION- ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS I THINK FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS IS THAT AND I AND I THINK SUSAN AS AS SENATOR ECHOING SKEWS ME- FOR HER COMMENTS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY MEASURE MEASURE TWICE AND CUT ONCE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS IT AND USE IT IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE MANNER- AND WHEN WE ARE ACTUALLY BUILDING THINGS- IT WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE COULD ACTUALLY- UTILIZE THE OPEN INFRASTRUCTURE- AS IS BEING CONSTRUCTED TO ACTUALLY MOVE THESE PROJECTS FORWARD- AND- WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE MOTION IS TO PASS IN ROOF RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION. SEGMENT OF SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

ELEVEN A STRIP THAT'S ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUTPUT WILL LOOK AT THE ROLE OF TRAPS MEMBERS WILL GO TO ITEM NUMBER THREE A. B. THREE TWENTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER SALAS SIR BILL RELATED. TO BIOMASS WELCOME SIR A SIMILAR NUMBER CELLS BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK SENATOR MEMBERS- PLEASE APOLOGIZE USE OF SUNGLASSES OF THEY ARE MEDICALLY NECESSARY THIS WEEK. BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWENTY TWO WHICH WILL CORRECT CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO CONSIDER PRIORITIZING. FUNDING FOR NEW INNOVATIVE BIOMASS PROJECTS THROUGH THE EPIC PROGRAM. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF FORESTRY MORE EPIC FUNDING IS NEEDED FOR BIOMASS PROJECTS TO REDUCE OPEN BURNING OF AGRICULTURAL WASTE. MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISKS AND CREATE CLEAN ENERGY TO STABILIZE OUR GRIDS EIGHTY THREE TWENTY TWO WILL HELP REDUCE WASTE AND MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS BY INVESTING IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF BIOMASS. PROJECTS WHICH WILL PRODUCE RENEWABLE ENERGY OUT OF WASTE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PUT IN A LANDFILL OR BURNED. AT MEMBERS JUST QUITE FRANKLY. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH THE BIOMASS FACILITIES BECAUSE IF YOU DRIVE THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR- EVEN A LOT OF PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS A LOT OF WAYS IS ACTUALLY PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. AND LIT ON FIRE AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IN TERMS OF PARTICULATE MATTER GOING INTO THE AIR. IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. THIS IS A MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS FOR SOME OF THAT TO BE CAPTURED. AND RISK FREE RENEWABLE ENERGY OUT OF IT. EIGHTY THREE TWENTY TWO IS SUPPORTED BY A WIDE COALITION OF AIR DISTRICTS. WATER AND WASTEWATER AGENCIES THIRTY SEVERAL COUNTIES RENEWABLE ENERGY STAKEHOLDERS. AND CLEAN ENERGY GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WITH LEADERS TESTIFIED BY PHONE SUPPORT IS. JULIA LEVIN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND MISS CHRISTINA DARLINGTON FROM THE PLASTER COUNTY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. VERY WELL IF THEY'RE ON THE PHONE WE HAVE THREE MINUTES SET ASIDE FOR BOTH SPEAKERS FOR EACH SPEAKER GETS. A MINUTE AND A HALF WILL BEGIN WITH JULIA LEVIN. WHAT ABOUT BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON JULIANNA SEVEN WITH A BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. A. B. THREE TWO TWO WILL PROVIDE MANY BENEFITS TO RATEPAYERS THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE CLIMATE. CALIFORNIA GENERATES MILLIONS OF TONS OF BIOMASS WASTE ANNUALLY INCLUDING FOREST WASTE THAT MUST BE REMOVED PURSUANT TO SB NINE OH ONE- CULTURAL WASTE AND URBAN WOOD WASTE. MOST OF THIS WASTE EITHER SENT TO LANDFILLS CAN PILE TO DECAY OR OPEN BURNED. ALL OF WHICH WERE THESE POWERFUL SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT. AND OF BURNING OR LANDFILLING IS WASTE CAN BE CONVERTED TO FIRM RENEWABLE POWER THAT'S AVAILABLE IN SOLAR AND WIND OR NOT. EIGHTY THREE TO ASK THE CDC TO CONSIDER USING EPIC FUNDING TO DEMONSTRATE NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO CONVERT BIOMASS WASTE TO ELECTRICITY. FUNDING CANNOT BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE EXISTING FACILITIES OLD TECHNOLOGIES. STATE AGENCIES ARE DEPENDING ON BIOMASS TO MEET A WIDE RANGE OF OBJECTIVES THE AIRPORT IS CALLED FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR BIOENERGY TO REDUCE OPEN BURNING OF WASTE THE BOARD OF FORESTRY IS CULTURE ETHICS FUNDING TO CONVERT FOREST BIOMASS TO ENERGY. RECYCLED WASTE DIVERSION REGULATIONS ONLY ALLOW TWO ALTERNATIVES TO LANDFILLING CONVERTING BIOMASS TO ELECTRICITY OR TO MULCH AND CPC A CALL FOR MORE FROM POWER FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES EIGHTY THREE TO HELP CALIFORNIA DEAL WITH MILLIONS OF TONS OF WASTE ANNUALLY AND INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF PHARMACEUTICAL POWER WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASS EIGHTY THREE TO TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL NOW MOVE TO- CHRISTINA DARLINGTON THE. PLASTER COUNTY- POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. HI THIS IS CHRISTINA ARLINGTON AND TESTIFYING ON TWITTER TO OUR DISTRICT ACTION NORTHERN SONOMA COUNTY AND THE COUNTY ARE POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. BOTH OF WHICH SUPPORT THIS BILL. AT TWO AM DECIDE WHAT JULIA HAD MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS MOMENTS. WE SEE THAT BIOMASS ENERGY CAN REALLY HELP OUR AIR QUALITY. FOR EXAMPLE PLASTER COUNTY WE DID A STUDY JUST OUT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT RECOGNIZES THAT USING BIOMASS. FOR ELECTRICITY ACTUALLY REDUCES BLACK CARBON AND PARTICULAR MATTER WHAT YOU'RE WANTING TO CHANGE MY NINETY EIGHT PERCENT. METHANE AND VOCS ARE REDUCED BY NINETY FIVE PERCENT. KNOX AND SMOG FORMING POLLUTANTS REDUCE BY OVER FORTY PERCENT. AND THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT ARE WELL RELEVANT TO THE EXISTING BIOMASS ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT THESE NUMBERS YOU CAN EXPECT EVEN FURTHER REDUCTIONS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A DANCE TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH. SOME OF THE MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ALSO RECOGNIZED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOCUS ON THE PORT THROUGH THE FOREST CARBON PLANTS AND USING BIOMASS LATER LIKE TRAGEDY AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES. BUT THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH. THE WOOD WASTE THAT'S COMING OUT OF OUR FUEL REDUCTION FUEL LOAD PRODUCT- PROJECT IF WE DO NOT FIND A WAY TO USE THAT AND THE PLACES WHERE WASTE USUALLY ENDS UP IN A WILDFIRE. EXACERBATING AN ALREADY CRITICAL ISSUE WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO ON ON BEHALF OF BOTH OF THE AIR DISTRICT. WE- I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER VOTING YES. ON THIS EIGHTY THREE TO TWO THANK YOU. I THIRTY OF THAT VERY MUCH THANK YOU. HOW WE'RE GONNA- WE CURRENT INSURED SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. BUT A. B. THREE TWENTY TWO WILL COME TO THE GALLERY AND THE SPEAKERS AND SUPPORT IN THE GALLERY WE HAVE.

AFTER WE WORK ALONGSIDE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE SEVENTEEN EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY- MANY OF WHOM ARE IMPACTED BY THE- BY OPEN AGRICULTURAL BURNING OF COURSE GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING. THE ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS AS WELL AS MEETING CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS UNFORTUNATELY ET THREE TWENTY TWO FAILS TO ADDRESS ADEQUATELY ADDRESS EITHER OF THESE SCHOOLS. HE YOU KNOW BIOMASS IS NOT A CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY- GET AMID CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS WELL IS IT ADMITTING. PARABEN AND IT. BUT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT IT YOU KNOW BIG BILL EIGHTY THREE TWENTY TWO WOULD COMMIT 20% OF EPIC'S FUNDING. TOWARD THESE TECHNOLOGIES RATHER THAN. INVESTING IN TRUE RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES IN ADDITION. ALTHOUGH BIOMASS FACILITIES ARE MARGINALLY BETTER THAN OPEN AGRICULTURAL BURNING CALIFORNIA SHOULDN'T SET INSTEAD INVEST IN NON EMITTING NON COMBUSTION SOLUTIONS. FOR AGRICULTURAL WASTE RATHER THAN INCENTIVISING PROGRAMS THAT CONTINUE TO AMEND AND CLICK THE ERROR AND COMMUTING TO WORK ALONG SIDE FOR THOSE REASONS. ALL WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON EIGHTY THREE TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU WILL GO TO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION OF A. B. THREE TWENTY TWO DO WE HAVE ANYONE HERE IN THE GALLERIES- THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THREE TWENTY TWO. OKAY WE'LL GO TO ROOM ONE TWELVE ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION NO ONE IS PRESENT ROOM ONE TWELVE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR COULD YOU PLEASE Q. SPEAKERS.

OKAY VERY WELL WILL COME TO THE FLOOR BEGINNING WITH THE CENTER A COMMAND AND FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR DEPORT PROVE IT TOUGH I COULD BE A CO AUTHOR THIS IS JUST KIND OF BILL THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE. INVESTING IN A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT THAT WE AS HUMANS MAKE TRASH IN OUR- ENVIRONMENT AND ON OUR WAYS OF LIVING HAVE HAVE PRODUCTS THAT WE MAKE IT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH WE DON'T DO SOMETHING WITH THEM THE EITHER END UP IN LANDFILLS AND I CAN CERTAINLY TELL YOU AS SOMEBODY WHO LIVES IN THE VALLEY IF YOU DRIVE DOWN THE VALLEY. ON A DAY WHEN THEY'RE DOING OPEN BURNS YOU CAN'T BREATHE YOU CAN'T SEE AND IT'S ALL JUST SITTING THERE HOVERING SUCH WHEN THE FOG STARTS ROLLING IN AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A BIG COMPRESSION KEEPING ALL THAT BAD AIR RIGHT DOWN ON THIS. IS A SMART WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THE WAYS THAT WE CREATE IN A LESSER GONNA STOP EATING I WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE WASTE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS JUST AS WE DO AS HUMAN BEINGS. SO I WOULD I WOULD MOVE THIS BILL I WOULD THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS AND I WOULD ASK. TO BE A CO AUTHOR. FERRE DOLLAR. THE MATURE ALSO LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THE OPPOSITION WHO CALLED IN. THAT LOOK IT ISN'T A 100% BUT IT'S 98% AND I'D RATHER HAVE 98% THEN ZERO WHAT YOU'RE GETTING FROM OPEN BURNER OTHER AREAS SO. THIS IS THE ONE AREA THAT I KNOW THE AUTHOR HAS WORKED ON THIS WE WORKED ON THESE TOGETHER WE HAD A- A BILL TOGETHER A FEW YEARS AGO TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

OKAY VERY WELL ANYONE ELSE THEN THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL SO THE MOTION BE DO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. SIR BRADFORD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TO JUST WANT TO. ADD MY VOICE IN SUPPORT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND IT'S AMAZING THAT YOU CAN GO TO EUROPE AND THEY HAVE BIOMASS AND BIO WASTE FACILITIES AND THERE IS CLEAN AS ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD EVER HOPE FOR BUT HERE IN AMERICA HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE CAN'T DO IT AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON STATED AS LONG AS YOU HAVE HUMAN BEINGS YOU WILL HAVE WASTE AND THIS IS A RELIABLE SOURCE IS DISPATCHABLE FAR MORE RELIABLE THAN WIND AND SOLAR SO I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE. OUR ON THIS COMMON SENSE MEASURE. VERY WELL- CENTER BECKER. VETERAN SAID THAT TAB I DO HEAR THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ARE JUST ONE NOTE THIS BILL. I READ DOESN'T SPECIFY IT BUT A PARTICULAR AMOUNT OR PERCENT OF EPIC FANTASY DOESN'T OBLIGATE ANYTHING IT DOES MAKE IT AVAILABLE. THROUGH THE CHAIR- YEAH THE OPPOSITION WAS ACTUALLY SPEAKING TO THE FIRST VERSION OF THE BILL BEFORE IT WAS AMENDED THAT HAD A PERCENTAGE THAT WE REMOVED AS AMENDMENTS. TO KIND OF SATISFY EVERYONE'S CONCERNS AS IT WAS MOVING THROUGH SO. THE OPPOSITION. FOR THE PERCENTAGE YOU ARE CORRECT WAS A PREVIOUS VERSION AND NOT IN THIS VERSION. GREAT JOB IT WANTS TO CLARIFY THAT.

FOR US TO MOVE TO MOVE FORWARD I'D RATHER HAVE I THINK IT WAS- SENATOR THAT SPOKE EARLIER FROM BEAVERS SAID 90% INSTEAD OF 0% BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW THE DISSERVICE TO CALIFORNIANS TO JUST OPEN FIELD BURN AND NOT CREATE RENEWABLE ENERGY OUT OF OUR WASTE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVE A- VERY WELL- WE HAVE A MOTION US SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

TANESHA THE BILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT THANK YOU THE ROLE OF REPS MEMBERS WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR A. B. FIVE TWENTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU- A BILL HAVING TO DO WITH WIND GENERATION WELCOME AND BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THE CENTERS. EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE WILL JUMP START A NEW CLEAN ENERGY INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA BY DIRECTING THE STATE TO PREPARE A STRATEGIC PLAN TO HARNESS THE POWER OF OFFSHORE WIND. AFTER THIS PAST YEAR HEAT WAVES WILDFIRES BLACKOUTS IN THE LOSS OF OVER A MILLION JOBS. CALIFORNIA HAS A ONCE IN A. GENERATION OPPORTUNITY JUST TWENTY TO THIRTY MILES OFF OUR COAST. TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. OUR STATE IS ACCESS TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST UNTAPPED SOURCES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. OFFSHORE WIND WITH THE POTENTIAL TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE MEEDER CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND PROVIDE GOOD PAYING JOBS. IN EUROPE AND ASIA MANY COUNTRIES ARE FAR AHEAD OF THE UNITED STATES IN THIS AREA. FORTUNATELY THE BINA MINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT IN OFFSHORE WIND. WELL EAST COAST STATES AUTHORITIES SAID TWENTY NINE GIGAWATTS OF TARGETS IN THIS ARENA. OUR STATE HAS ESTABLISHED NINE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT LEFT BEHIND. THIS BILL GIVES US THE CHANCE TO CATCH UP PARTICULARLY WITH THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND A GOVERNOR TO MOVE FORWARD WITH LEASE AUCTIONS OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST. BUFFER WIND CAN ENSURE A DIVERSE RELIABLE PORTFOLIO OF CLEAN POWER. COMPLEMENTING SOLAR WITH WIND ENERGY AT NIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS DOWN. IT WILL ADD THOUSANDS OF HIGHLY SKILLED JOBS IN SUPPLY CHAIN DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. MODELING BY THE SP ONE HUNDRED JOINT AGENCY REPORT SHOWED THAT WITHOUT OFFSHORE WIND TOTAL ENERGY COSTS BECOMES ONE BILLION DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. BECAUSE OFFSHORE WIND ALLOW RENEWABLES TO MEET ENERGY MAN DURING ALL HOURS. ALL AROUND THE YEAR. THIS WILL MAKE SURE WE TAP INTO ALL THE BENEFITS OF OFFSHORE WIND BY GIVING WHILE GIVING CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TO OUR STATE'S MARINE AND COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS AND PRIORITIZING DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS OF LEAST CONFLICT. WITH THAT I LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESSES LAURA HAHN WITH ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA. AND JEREMY SMITH WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES.

I'M HERE CHAIRMAN RICE SO AND THEN THE NUMBER TWO AND I'M ALREADY HOME STATE DIRECTOR AT ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR EIGHTY FIVE TO FIVE SO THAT WE CAN KICK START OFF SHORE WIND OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST. THE REASON HEAT WAVES WILDFIRES AND THE CURRENT DRIVE EMERGENCY UNDERSCORED THE NEED TO ACCELERATE OUR TRANSITION. TO A ONE OF THE BACK CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL IS THE WIND BLOWING OFF OUR COAST SH WHERE THE WIND BLOWS FASTER AND HARDER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR RECENT REPORT OFFSHORE WIND FOR AMERICA AND THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL COULD MEET MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF. OUR ENTIRE STATE ELECTRICITY NEEDS FROM TWENTY NINETEEN JACK FROM OFFSHORE WIND. EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY FIVE WILL CATALYZE CALIFORNIA'S OFFICIAL PRODUCTION BY DIRECTING THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO COORDINATE WITH THE RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES. ARTICLE AND CREATE A PLAN TO PULL BACK ON OFF SHORE WIND POWER PROTECTING OUR CRITICAL MARINE ECOSYSTEM SHOULD CONTACT EIGHT FIVE DIVERSITY AND THE FASTER WE CAN MOVE TO THE CLOUD CLEAN ENERGY AND FAT AS- BURNING FOSSIL FUELS THE BAXTER COUNTY ALL HAVE FOR THE FUTURE.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER. WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR AS WELL IN ORDER TO BE A CO AUTHOR HERE JUST THREE QUICK POINTS THAT OFFSHORE WIND IS. ACTUALLY CRUCIAL TO MEETING OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS OF A 100% CLEAN ENERGY SECONDLY THAT WITHOUT OFFSHORE WIND IT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO SO. AND THIRD IS THE AUTHOR MENTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A NEW EXPORT INDUSTRY FOR THIS STATE AS WEST COAST CENTER FOR MANUFACTURING PORT FACILITIES INSTALLATION EXPERTISE. WHICH CAN DRIVE NEW- COULD PAY WELL PAID JOBS SO I'M- UNDER SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. CENTER REDFORD. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND I TO SUPPORT WHOLEHEARTEDLY THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE PROMISE OF OFFSHORE WIND I'VE SEEN IT WORK AGAIN OVER IN EUROPE SO IT'S NO DOUBT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY. TIME HAS COME MY CONCERN HERE IS ALWAYS THE PROMISE. OF JOBS AND- AND PROMISE OF A DIVERSE WORKFORCE MAPPED. A INDIVIDUAL WHO SPENT CLOSE TO TWENTY YEARS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR. THE PROMISE OF DIVERSE JOBS HAS NOT YET TO ARRIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THE ART PORTFOLIO HAS DIVERSIFIED OUR WORKFORCE HASN'T SHOW. ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROMISE JOBS THEY HAVE TO BE REAL AND WE GOT TO QUIT USING. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND POOR FOLKS AS A REASON WHY WE DO MOST OF THESE THINGS WHEN THEY VERY RARELY IF EVER. BENEFIT FROM ANY OF THESE JOBS AND I HOPE THAT A EUROPEAN CONT COMPANY. IS OUR GOAL I QUESTION IF THEY'RE FAR MORE COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY HERE IN THIS COUNTRY THAN THEY ARE IN THEIR OWN BUT- HOPEFULLY- YOU CAN PROVE ME WRONG BUT- I SUPPORT THE TECHNOLOGY BUT AGAIN. I HOPE THE JOBS ARE REALITY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A WIND AND SOLAR INDUSTRY SO- HOPEFULLY WE CAN SEE IT IN OFF SHORE WHERE. ANYONE ELSE TO HAVE A MOTION. SENATOR DODD- MAKES A MOTION MOTION IS TO PASS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER- THE CENTER RUBIO DID YOU WANNA MAKE A COMMENT. YES THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR I THINK THAT YOU NOW THIS BILL WILL BRING A LOT IMMEDIATE BENEFITS BUT ALSO LONG TERM BENEFITS AND I THINK JUST TOPPED BUT GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT IT WILL PRODUCES BENEFIT IN ITSELF BUT YOU KNOW ALSO MEETING OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO. BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. DID YOU WANNA MAKE SOME CLOSING COMMENTS CENTER TEACHER.

AND I KNOW YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON. UTILITY SUPPLIER DIVERSITY AND I APPLAUD THAT I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THAT IN THIS BILL- THERE ARE PROVISIONS THAT HAS THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. PLANS FOR THIS PARTICULAR AROUND WORK FORCE THAT THEY LOOK AT. HOW WE HAVE TARGETED HIRING STANDARDS WHICH REALLY IS LOOKING AT THE DIVERSITY OF THIS FUTURE WORK FORCE WE WANNA MAKE SURE- THAT IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL HERE- WE'RE PUTTING EVERY ASPECT OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO WORK AND DOING THAT IN A NEW WAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE JUST TRANSITION AND I. I JUST THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE WILL CERTAINLY BE MONITORING TO SEE OTHER NONSENSE- AS THIS PROCEEDS- ELSE WANNA JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK THE TREMENDOUS COALITION OF LABOR. ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLEAN ENERGY ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WE'VE HAD FOR THIS. THIS IS- OFFSHORE WIND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY TRANSFORM OUR STATE. WITH ENORMOUS ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF WORK BUT IT'S GOT TO START WITH THEM WITH PLANNING- AND REALLY THINKING HOLISTICALLY ABOUT HOW WE PUT CALIFORNIA ON THE MAP. PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FAR AHEAD OF US- WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY AND HOPEFULLY WITH THIS BILL WE CAN DO THAT- AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE.

SIX FORTY ONE BY- SIMPLY GERMAN HOLDEN. A BILL HAVING TO DO WITH- PUBLICLY ONLY ELECTRIC UTILITIES. BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY MEMBERS I FIRST LIKE TO START. BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS- TODAY. AND TO THINK THAT YOU'RE IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ATTENTION AND DEDICATION TO IMPROVING THE SPELL. AS WE HAVE SEEN DEMAND FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS GROWING. WE HAVE A SET GOAL IN THE STATE OF FIVE MILLION EV'S BY TWENTY THIRTY WHICH MEANS WE'LL NEED OVER ONE MILLION SHARED CHARGERS TO COME ON LINE ACROSS THE STATE. BUILD OUT OF THE V. CHARGERS IS OCCURRING IN MANY AREAS BUT WE ARE RELYING HEAVILY ON THE STATE'S ELECTRIC I'LL USE TO FILL THIS NEED. WE MUST BE SURE THAT PO USER FILLING THE GAP IN THEIR TERRITORIES AS WELL. AS THEY SERVE A THIRD OF OUR STATE'S ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS. THIS BILL WOULD DO JUST THAT BY REQUIRING ALL PEOPLE USED TO INSURE PUBLIC CHARGING IS AVAILABLE IN THEIR TERRITORIES AND IT GIVES THEM FULL ATTITUDE ON HOW THEY MAKE THAT HAPPEN INCLUDING CHARGING FOR THE SERVICE OR WORKING WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY. TO FILL THE NEED MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS ON EIGHTY SIX FORTY ONE. AND WE HAVE SOME- SPEAKERS- IN AN ORGANIZED PRESENTATION- WE HAVE IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION. WE'LL BEGIN WITHIN SUPPORT WE HAVE A SCOTT WHAT'S LISTED AS A SPEAKER. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS CAN YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. AS YOU KNOW- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- PLANS TO SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON CONTINUING TO EXPAND THE T. V- INFRASTRUCTURE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED NUMEROUS BILLS- DIRECTING THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO BUILD OUT THEIR TEARS SERVICE TERRITORIES THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE GREAT SWATHS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH ARE COVERED BY MUNICIPAL UTILITIES AND MANY OF THOSE AREAS ARE IMPOVERISHED- IN BOTH RURAL AND URBANIZED- TERRITORIES. IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES INVEST. ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A STATE WOULD HAVE AND HAVE NOTS AND THEN ALL OF THOSE- AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
