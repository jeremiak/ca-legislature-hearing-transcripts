FOLLOWING THE REPATRIATION ACT-

BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS REAL

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:46.677
INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:50.014
CAMPUSES- UC BERKELEY HAD. THE

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:52.250

IN THOSE REMAINS AND THEN

00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:21.779
SIMILARLY AS FAR AS

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.581
COMMUNICATION THERE NEEDS TO BE

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:24.916

THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF TRIBES

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:36.427

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:38.095
COMMUNICATIONS. THEY WERE

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:39.564
EXPECTING THINGS IN WRITING

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.300

ISSUES HOW TOGETHER THE THIRD

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:20.891

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:34.605
COMMITTEES HAVE EQUAL

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:36.473
REPRESENTATION OF UNIVERSITY

JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT WAS

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.983
NOT THE CASE. IN FACT I UC

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.217
BERKELEY WAS PARTICULARLY

00:44:47.284 --> 00:44:49.753
PROBLEMATIC BUT WE SAW PROBLEMS

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.921
WITH THE COMPOSITION OF THOSE

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:52.156
COMMITTEES AT EACH OF THE

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:54.191
CAMPUSES THAT WE LOOK AT SO

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:55.826
THIS WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN

00:44:55.893 --> 00:44:57.895
THAT WE HAVE- BECAUSE THE

00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.396
UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA WAS NOT

LEGISLATURE'S INTENT WAS WHEN

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:05.035

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.757
BECAUSE THE- COMMISSION

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:28.325
NOMINATES THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:29.760

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:44.414
SO WHAT WOULD YOU TELL ME. AS

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:46.016
SOMEONE WHO'S VERY INTERESTED

00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:47.784
IN THIS MATTER WHAT WHAT IS

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:49.352
KEEPING BERKELEY FROM DOING A

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:55.291
BETTER JOB. AS COMPARED TO UCLA

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:58.828
AND UC DAVIS SURE MISTER MEDINA

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:00.930
AND I'LL AND I'LL DEFER TO

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:02.899
MISTER ADAMS AND MAN ONE OF THE

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.734
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH YOU

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:07.337
BERKELEY'S ROACH IS THAT OVER

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:09.305
EXPECTING TRIBES TO PROVIDE

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:12.375
MUCH MORE EVIDENCE THAN OTHER

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:16.780
UCLA OR UC DAVIS ALSO- WITH

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:18.548
THREE STATUS WORK WITH RESPECT

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:19.783
TO AFFILIATION AND THEN THERE'S

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:21.718
A DISPOSITION JUST A DIFFERENT

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.687
PROCESS AND THAT ONE IS ISN'T

00:55:23.753 --> 00:55:25.388
INVOLVES COMMUNICATION WITH THE

00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:27.190
DIFFERENT TRIBES SO REACHING

00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:28.625
OUT TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:31.528
TRIBES HI JERRY TO DETERMINE

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:35.999
WHETHER OR NOT. THEY ARE

00:55:36.066 --> 00:55:36.566
AFFILIATED OR OR ASSOCIATED

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:37.600
WITH IT OF THOSE THREE ARE AND

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.269
WHAT WE SAW THAT YOU SEE BURKE

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.304
IS AND MORE STRINGENT PROCESS

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:42.572
THEY WERE EXPECTING STUFF THEY

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:44.808
REACHED OUT TO FIFTEEN TRIBES

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.176
THEY WERE WAITING TO HEAR BACK

00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:48.578
IN WRITING. FROM EACH AND EVERY

00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:49.913
ONE OF THOSE TRIED BEFORE THEY

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.214
WERE WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD IN

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:53.450
THE PROCESS AND WE FELT THAT

00:55:53.516 --> 00:55:54.884
THAT WAS VERY STRINGENT. NOW

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:56.419
AGAIN I THINK THE UNIVERSITY

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:58.154
CALIFORNIA THEY ALSO PRESENT

00:55:58.221 --> 00:56:00.724
NEEDS TO GET THAT POLICY WITH

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:02.225
RESPECT TO FOLLOW THIS.

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:03.927
REPATRIATION ACT IS GOING TO BE

00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:05.962
CARRIED OUT OUT THERE SO THAT

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.597
THERE IS CONSISTENCY FROM ONE

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:08.832
CAMPUS TO ANOTHER BECAUSE I

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:11.568
THINK BERKELEY. IS BEING MUCH

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:13.503
MORE RESTRICTIVE ON MAKING IT

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.105
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR TRIBES

00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:17.474
TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS AND

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.708
FOR THOSE REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:20.343
SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THEIR

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.011
RIGHTFUL OWNERS BUT I'LL I'LL

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:23.446
ASK HIM IF HE HAS ANY OTHER

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:25.348
ADDITIONAL CONTENT AND AGAIN

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.417
WHILE OTHER CAMPUSES HAVE.

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:32.489
CLOSE 290% BERKELEY. IS ONLY

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.057
WHERE AT WHAT ARE APPROXIMATELY

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:35.825
NINE TWENTY FIRST HAS A TINY

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:38.828
FOR. OF OUT THE RETURNING WHAT

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:41.164
WHAT NEEDS TO BE RETURNED RIGHT

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:42.999
AND THEY SIGNIFICAN THEY HAVE A

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:44.801
VERY LARGE COLLECTION SO THERE

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:46.236
ARE A LOT OF REMAINS AND

00:56:46.302 --> 00:56:49.139
ARTEFACTS AT UC BERKELEY STILL

00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:49.773
AT LEAST AT THE TIME WE

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:51.775
CONDUCTED THE AUDIT LAST YEAR I

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:54.077
STILL HAVE IN ITS INVENTORY

00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:55.545
THAT IT NEEDS TO REALLY WORK

00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:57.781
VERY HARD AND RETURNING THOSE

00:56:57.847 --> 00:57:00.316
THOSE ARTIFACTS AND REMAINS- WE

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:00.817
NEED TO SEE MUCH BETTER

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:03.186
PROGRESS. WITH UC BERKELEY AND

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:05.488
IT IF YOU COPY YOU KNOW REALLY

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:07.323
FOCUSES AS WE SAID THERE'S THAT

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.658
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT THEY

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:10.727
DEVELOPED RELATED TO MISSING

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.695
REMAINS BAKER PLAN TOGETHER BUT

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:13.963
AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.565
THAT PLANS MEDICAL MINUTES SO I

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:16.766
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.802
OF FOCUS AND ATTENTION ON YEARS

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:20.970

GETTING THESE REMAINS AND

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:29.879
ARTIFACTS RETURNED. ONTO THE

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:30.880

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:22.585
ONLY EVIDENCE THAT WE AVE AND

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:07.769
PRESSING MY COMPLETE. I DON'T

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:12.073
KNOW FRUSTRATION- AND JUST-

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.574
UNACCEPTABILITY OF WHAT I'M

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:18.112
HEARING. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:20.648
THIS AT CONTINUED TO HEAR THE

01:30:20.715 --> 01:30:21.682

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.555
YOU KNOW I WAS IN A HEARING ON

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:29.590
A DIFFERENT TOPIC IN HIGHER

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:30.958
EDUCATION AND I REMEMBER THE

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.760
PROFESSOR FROM BERKELEY WHO

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:34.695
SAID THINGS HAPPEN WHEN THEY

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:36.697
WANT TO HAPPEN I THINK THAT IS

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:39.734
TRUE I THINK IT'S TRUE IN LOTS

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:42.603
OF DIFFERENT THINGS- CERTAINLY

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:44.105
IN HIGHER EDUCATION I THINK

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:46.107
IT'S TRUE WHEN THERE'S A WILL

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.408
TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AND I

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:50.778
THINK UCLA AND UC DAVIS ARE

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:52.880
EXAMPLES OF THAT THEY HAPPEN

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.715

BERKELEY'S APPROACH YOU KNOW

01:41:42.429 --> 01:41:44.264
UNNECESSARY LIFE UNNECESSARILY

THEY THEY CLAIM AND YOU CAN

01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:04.318
TELL ME BECAUSE YOU'RE A

01:42:04.384 --> 01:42:06.186

CAMPUS IS NOT CONNECT FOR THE

01:42:07.354 --> 01:42:24.771
WORK ON A. BECAUSE QUOTE IT IS

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:26.440
NOT THE CAMPUS PLACE PRESSURE

01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:28.208
TRIBES RESPOND TO THE TIMELINE

01:42:28.275 --> 01:42:30.477
THAT IT SETS AND QUOTE. AS A

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:32.012
RESULT OF TOOK ANOTHER TWENTY

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:33.313

WHO SHOULD RIVER WHO SHOULD

RECEIVE THE REMAINS- SO I GUESS

01:42:48.295 --> 01:42:50.130
THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WHAT

01:42:50.197 --> 01:42:51.398
IS UC BERKELEY GOING TO DO TO

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:53.166
PREVENT A RECURRENCE AND ENSURE

01:42:53.233 --> 01:43:07.481

COMPARED TO MANY MANY MONTHS

01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:42.282
PREVIOUSLY AND I THINK THAT'S

01:43:42.349 --> 01:43:45.152

01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:21.154
PROCESS SEES FOR RETURNING-

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:25.092
ITEMS- THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

01:44:25.158 --> 01:44:28.295
IT WE NO LONGER- PLAY THE

01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:31.431
WAITING GAME- GIVE US MORE

01:44:31.498 --> 01:44:32.899
EVIDENCE GIVE US MORE EVIDENCE

01:44:32.966 --> 01:44:34.401
GIVES MORE EVIDENCE EACH ONE OF

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:36.069
THESE INTERACTIONS TAKING

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:37.771
LITERALLY MONTHS IF NOT YEARS

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:39.673
TO COMPLETE A CYCLE. WE'VE NOW

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.676
MOVED TOWARDS- TAKING A MUCH

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:45.145
GREATER WEIGHT OF ORAL

01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:48.715
TESTIMONY AND- WE'RE NOT

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:52.853
LOOKING FOR- ARCHAEOLOGICAL-

01:44:52.919 --> 01:44:55.756
PROOF- AFFILIATION BUT WE'RE

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:57.791
WE'RE FOLLOWING- THE NEW

01:44:57.858 --> 01:45:00.927
PROCESS- LISTENING TO ORAL

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:02.596
TRADITIONS AND TAKING INTO

01:45:02.663 --> 01:45:04.264
ACCOUNT GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:06.099
THINGS OF THAT NATURE. WHICH

01:45:06.166 --> 01:45:08.435
WILL WILL HELP US IN A MUCH

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:11.238
MORE RAPID APPROACH- IN ORDER

01:45:11.304 --> 01:45:13.106
TO RENDER A DECISION TO-

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:15.175
REPATRIATES SO THERE ARE

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:16.810
NUMEROUS THINGS BOTH IN TERMS

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:17.978
OF ADDITIONAL STAFFING IN

01:45:18.045 --> 01:45:20.113
ADDITIONAL STAFF ROLES. TO WORK

01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:22.049
PROACTIVELY AND COLLABORATIVELY

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:23.116
WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN

01:45:23.183 --> 01:45:24.651
COMMUNITY AND AN INTERNAL

01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:28.155
PROCESS THAT- YOU KNOW VALUES

01:45:28.221 --> 01:45:30.357
AND PRIVILEGES THE ORAL

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:32.325
HISTORIES AND TRADITIONS SO

01:45:32.392 --> 01:45:33.293
THAT WE CAN GET TO A

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.995
REPATRIATION DECISION MUCH

01:45:35.062 --> 01:45:38.298
FASTER. THESE ARE EXAMPLES- OF

01:45:38.365 --> 01:45:40.167
I THINK- THESE KINDS OF

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:41.535
APPROACHES HAVE BEEN USED AT

01:45:41.601 --> 01:45:43.837
OTHER UC CAMPUSES AND IS A PART

01:45:43.904 --> 01:45:45.338
OF THE VALUE OF THE SYSTEM WIDE

01:45:45.405 --> 01:45:47.474
APPROACH. THAT YOU SEE AS THAT

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:49.710
WE CAN LEARN BEST PRACTICES

01:45:49.776 --> 01:45:51.278
FROM THOSE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE

01:45:51.344 --> 01:45:53.480
DONE WELL IN LARGELY IF NOT

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.015
COMPLETELY REPATRIATING THEIR

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:56.917
HOLDINGS SUCH AS UCLA AND

01:45:56.983 --> 01:45:59.586
DAVIS- WERE WERE ADOPTING THEIR

01:45:59.653 --> 01:46:01.154
BEST PRACTICES SO THAT WE CAN

01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:02.789
MOVE THROUGH WHAT AMOUNTS TO

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:04.491
THE LARGEST COLLECTION. OF

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:09.529
HOLDINGS WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM.

01:46:09.596 --> 01:46:10.230
IN A MUCH MORE RAPID MANNER

01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:11.565
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:14.701
AND- LOOK FORWARD TO MORE.

01:46:14.768 --> 01:46:16.737
EXPEDIENCY AND THAT WITH THE-

01:46:16.803 --> 01:46:19.106
WITH THE NEW- POLICIES- JUST

01:46:19.172 --> 01:46:20.540
QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION YOU

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:22.642
MENTIONED EARLIER THE UC

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:24.444
BERKELEY- CONTAINS A LARGE

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:26.413
INVENTORY AND- THINK IT WAS

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.948
REPORTED THAT OVER HALF A

01:46:28.014 --> 01:46:29.983
MILLION TRIBAL ARTIFACTS ARE

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:31.551
ACTUALLY IN UC BERKELEY'S

01:46:31.618 --> 01:46:34.154
POSSESSION- AND I KNOW YOU

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:36.323
SAID. YOU KNOW PERCENTAGES.

01:46:36.389 --> 01:46:39.025
DON'T DO- DON'T TELL THE WHOLE

01:46:39.092 --> 01:46:40.794
STORY BUT CAN YOU TELL ME OF.

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.863
THOSE TRIBAL REMAINS AND

01:46:42.929 --> 01:46:44.698
ARTIFACTS HOW MANY HAVE BEEN

01:46:44.765 --> 01:46:47.200
REPATRIATED OF THE NEARLY HALF

01:46:47.267 --> 01:46:50.937
A MILLION YES WELL I WILL GET

01:46:51.004 --> 01:46:52.139
YOU YOU KNOW SORT OF FULL

01:46:52.205 --> 01:46:54.040
INFORMATION IN A FOLLOW UP ON

01:46:54.107 --> 01:46:55.709
THAT BUT I DO HAVE SOME

01:46:55.776 --> 01:46:57.644
STATISTICS AT MY FINGERTIPS OF

01:46:57.711 --> 01:46:58.879
WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO OVER

01:46:58.945 --> 01:47:00.347
THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS JUST TO

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:02.315
PUT THINGS IN IN PERSPECTIVE.

01:47:02.382 --> 01:47:05.986
SO WE OVER THE PAST YEAR WE

01:47:06.052 --> 01:47:08.288
REPATRIATED TWO HUNDRED AND

01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:09.322
NINETY EIGHT CENTS OF ANCESTRAL

01:47:09.389 --> 01:47:11.892
REMAINS- IF I RECALL THE RIGHT

01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:13.593
NUMBER WE HAVE ABOUT TEN

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.862
THOUSAND- WE HAD OF

01:47:15.929 --> 01:47:18.565
REPATRIATION A FEW YEARS AGO A

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:21.134
FIFTEEN HUNDRED REMAINS- SO TWO

01:47:21.201 --> 01:47:21.768
HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT OVER YEAR

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:22.969
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT

01:47:23.036 --> 01:47:25.539
IT'S INDICATIVE OF. OUR EFFORTS

01:47:25.605 --> 01:47:28.542
TO ACCELERATE THE RETURN- OVER

01:47:28.608 --> 01:47:30.744
ALMOST SIXTEEN THOUSAND SETS OF

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.445
FUNERARY OBJECTS WERE RETURNED

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:34.314
IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS AND

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:35.849
TWENTY THREE CULTURAL ITEMS WE

01:47:35.916 --> 01:47:38.885
HAD SEVEN NOTICES OF A

01:47:38.952 --> 01:47:40.687
REPATRIATION OVER THE LAST

01:47:40.754 --> 01:47:41.254
TWELVE MONTHS AND I LEARNED

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:43.123
THIS MORNING WE HAD AN EIGHT

01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:44.991
THAT WAS PUBLISHED YESTERDAY SO

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:46.426
THESE ARE SIGNATURES OF HOW

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:48.361
WE'RE TRYING TO ACCELERATE. BUT

01:47:48.428 --> 01:47:50.730
CHAIR CHAIR SALAS I ALSO WANT

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:51.364
TO PUT IN THE IN THE

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:55.035
PERSPECTIVE OKAY TEN THOUSAND

01:47:55.101 --> 01:47:57.337
UMAN REMAINS WE WISH TO

01:47:57.404 --> 01:48:01.007
REPATRIATE ALL OF THEM. ARE IN

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:03.710
THE LAST YEAR WE'VE DONE ABOUT

01:48:03.777 --> 01:48:04.444
THREE HUNDRED YOU CAN DO THE

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:07.013
MATH THIS IS JUST AN ENORMOUS

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.416
LEFT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO

01:48:09.482 --> 01:48:12.352
IDENTIFY TO WHOM THESE REMAINS

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:15.555
ARE- AFFILIATED WITH THE LONG

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:16.122
TWO OR THE APPROPRIATE

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:18.525
DESCENDANTS- WE DON'T WANT TO

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:19.826
STAND IN THE WAY OF THAT BUT

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:21.428
JUST THE SHEER NUMBERS

01:48:21.494 --> 01:48:22.896
REPRESENT A TREMENDOUS

01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:24.164
CHALLENGE FOR US WITH OUR

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:27.500
EXISTING RESOURCES. TO GET FROM

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:28.134
THREE HUNDRED A YEAR TO A

01:48:28.201 --> 01:48:32.472
NUMBER MORE LIKE. THREE

01:48:32.539 --> 01:48:33.106
THOUSAND A YEAR. WHICH IS WHERE

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:34.341
WE WANT TO GO AND JUST AS

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:36.309
FOLLOW UP WHAT WOULD YOU NEED

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:38.144
TO ACCOMPLISH THAT I MEAN. I

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:39.679
WOULD IMAGINE DNA TESTING HELPS

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:41.915
A LOT SHE SAID USE A DIFFERENT

01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:44.251
METHODS TERRITORIAL. AND WHAT

01:48:44.317 --> 01:48:46.086
NOT BUT WHAT. WHAT WOULD IT

01:48:46.152 --> 01:48:47.754
TAKE TO GET THERE TO THE THREE

01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:49.856
THOUSAND METER YES WELL THE AYE

01:48:49.923 --> 01:48:51.258
AYE AGAIN AN EXCELLENT QUESTION

01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:55.996
SHARE SALAS- DNA TESTING IS NOT

01:48:56.062 --> 01:48:58.131
SOMETHING THAT WE USE OUR

01:48:58.198 --> 01:49:00.467
BECAUSE IT'S IN THE DESTRUCTIVE

01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:02.636
MATH METHOD AND YOU KNOW THERE

01:49:02.702 --> 01:49:04.671
ARE MANY MANY CULTURAL ISSUES

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:06.640
ASSOCIATED WITH- USING THAT

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.875
KIND OF APPROACH SO THE WAY

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:11.878
THAT WE ARE GOING FORWARD IS

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:14.047
THAT MANY OF THE ANCESTRAL

01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:15.949
REMAINS A LARGE VERY LARGE

01:49:16.016 --> 01:49:18.852
NUMBER OF THEM. I AS ONE COULD

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.553
IMAGINE WERE FROM THE

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:23.290
GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF THE UP ALONE

01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:25.692
EIGHT PEOPLE AND- THE SORT OF

01:49:25.759 --> 01:49:28.261
BAY AREA COMMUNITIES AND SO BY

01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:31.331
WORKING WITH THAT GROUP OF-

01:49:31.398 --> 01:49:33.733
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WE ARE HAVE

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:35.669
THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING ABLE

01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:37.504
TO REPATRIATE VERY LARGE

01:49:37.570 --> 01:49:41.942
NUMBERS. OF REMAINS IN A SINGLE

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:44.678
ACTION IN A SINGLE INTERACTION

01:49:44.744 --> 01:49:46.713
WITH THE TRIBES AND THROUGH THE

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:48.715
NECESSARY THE DICTATED BY

01:49:48.782 --> 01:49:50.717
POLICY PROCESS SEEMS TO DO IT

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:51.718
SO THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT

01:49:51.785 --> 01:49:54.421
WE'RE TAKING IS TO IDENTIFY

01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:57.290
THOSE ITEMS AND ANCESTORS

01:49:57.357 --> 01:50:00.093
WITHIN OUR COLLECTION. THAT WE

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.996
ALREADY KNOW BECAUSE OF THE

01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:05.098
GEOGRAPHY THE COMMUNITY OF

01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:06.833
INTEREST ARE SO THAT WE CAN

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.903
WORK WITH THEM TO ACHIEVE LARGE

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.771
GROUP REPATRIATIONS.

01:50:11.838 --> 01:50:13.974
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THAT'S OW

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.175
WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO THE

01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:16.476
VERY LARGE NUMBERS AND OF

01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:17.677
COURSE IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE

01:50:17.744 --> 01:50:21.581
NEED. THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF- YOU

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:23.616
KNOW SORT OF STAFFING SUPPORT-

01:50:23.683 --> 01:50:25.652
IN ORDER TO DOCUMENT THOSE

01:50:25.719 --> 01:50:26.987
THINGS AND SO ON AND I I'D

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:28.621
MENTION THAT NOT BECAUSE I WANT

01:50:28.688 --> 01:50:30.457
TO SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN. WE

01:50:30.523 --> 01:50:32.492
ARE ENTIRELY COMMITTED TO

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:33.927
REPATRIATING OUR ENTIRE

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:35.962
COLLECTION AS SOON AS IS

01:50:36.029 --> 01:50:38.098
FEASIBLE IT'S REALLY A QUESTION

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:39.933
OF GETTING THOSE INVENTORIES

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.102
CORRECT CORRECT IDENTIFYING THE

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:43.903
COMMUNITIES TO INTERACT WITH

01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:45.739
WORKING WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:46.606
TO ESTABLISH THE RIGHT

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:48.908
DOCUMENTATION SO THAT WE CAN DO

01:50:48.975 --> 01:50:50.777
VERY LARGE GROUP REPATRIATIONS-

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:54.247
OF. ALL IN THE SINGLES WOULD

01:50:54.314 --> 01:50:55.815
GOT IT UNDERSTOOD APPRECIATE

01:50:55.882 --> 01:50:57.617
THAT AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE

01:50:57.684 --> 01:50:58.718
LOOKING AT THE REPORT A LOT OF

01:50:58.785 --> 01:51:02.022
IT. POINTS TO INADEQUACIES AT

01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:04.557
UC BERKELEY. AND OTHERS ASKING

01:51:04.624 --> 01:51:05.792
THE SAME QUESTION LAST

01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:09.896
PROPOSES- WHEN YOU ANTICIPATE.

01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:11.998
I GUESS JUST FOR UC BERKELEY

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:15.368
ANYWAYS IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THE

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:15.935
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE AUDIT

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:20.407
REPORT YEAH SO- AS I MENTIONED

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:22.609
TO OUR- WE HAVE ALREADY

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:25.178
RECONSTITUTE ARE NAG ADVISORY

TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE'RE ONE

01:51:29.315 --> 01:51:31.084
OF THE TWO UC CAMPUSES THAT

01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:33.553
THAT ACTED ON THE COMMITTEE.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:36.056
RECOMMENDED THAT THE- AUDIT

01:51:36.122 --> 01:51:37.724
FINDING ABOUT ESTABLISHING-

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:38.658
COMMITTEE WITH TRIBAL

01:51:38.725 --> 01:51:40.627
REPRESENTATION WE'VE GOT THAT

01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:42.429
SINCE JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR

TO REVIEW CASES AND TO MAKE

01:51:51.104 --> 01:51:52.972
REPATRIATION DECISIONS SO WE'RE

SCIENTIFIC STUDY THAT IS NO

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:43.970
LONGER THE DESIRED GOAL OF THE

02:00:44.036 --> 02:00:45.871
UNIVERSITY TO HAVE THESE ITEMS

02:00:45.938 --> 02:00:48.040

THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN

02:01:02.221 --> 02:01:04.724
AND- THE ABILITY TO WAIT ORAL

02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:07.193
TRADITIONS. IS A DRAMATIC

02:01:07.259 --> 02:01:09.528
REDUCTION ON THE BURDEN TO THE

02:01:09.595 --> 02:01:11.163
NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES TO

FOR THE UNIVERSITY AND FOR ME

02:01:48.467 --> 02:01:50.302

REQUIREMENTS WE MUST HAVE THIS.

02:02:15.361 --> 02:02:17.029

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:52.131
REMAINS THAT WERE NOT IN THE

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:53.833
MUSEUM WE WERE ABLE TO COLLECT

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:55.334

ONE HALF OF 1% OF THE ITEMS-

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:32.037
THAT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY SO

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:34.607
IT'S A SMALL NUMBER. BUT IT'S

02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:36.342
ONE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO

02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:38.177
TRACK DOWN IN IMPROVE OUR

02:03:38.244 --> 02:03:40.579
INVENTORIES BUT WE DO THIS IN

02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:42.214
CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH A

02:03:42.281 --> 02:03:43.816
NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES

02:03:43.883 --> 02:03:46.051
BECAUSE- SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:48.420
MORE HARM. BY LOOKING FOR

02:03:48.487 --> 02:03:50.623
THINGS THEN THEN NOT

02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:52.191
NECESSARILY KNOWING EXACTLY

02:03:52.258 --> 02:03:53.959
WHERE THEY ARE I KNOW THAT

02:03:54.026 --> 02:03:56.162
SOUNDS SOUNDS A LITTLE STRANGE

02:03:56.228 --> 02:04:01.000
BUT- WE DO NOT WISH TO DISTURB.

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:01.600
THE ANCESTRAL REMAINS THAT WE

02:04:01.667 --> 02:04:03.435
HAVE IN ORDER TO FIND IT MAY BE

02:04:03.502 --> 02:04:06.272
ON A MISSING ANCESTRAL BONE. OR

02:04:06.338 --> 02:04:08.674
SOME SUCH- YOU KNOW SOME ARE

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:11.677
PART OF AN ANCESTRAL REMAINS-

02:04:11.744 --> 02:04:14.413
SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ADVANCING

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:16.448
NOT TO SLOW ANYTHING DOWN IN

02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:19.218
NOT TO- YOU KNOW SORT OF MAKING

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:21.487
EXCUSES BUT IN IN. VERY

02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:23.689
CULTURALLY SENSITIVE WAY OF

02:04:23.756 --> 02:04:25.024
WORKING WITH THE NATIVE

02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:27.026
AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO CORRECT

02:04:27.092 --> 02:04:29.762
AND UPDATE OUR INVENTORY TO GET

02:04:29.829 --> 02:04:31.730
TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. BUT IN

02:04:31.797 --> 02:04:33.065
A WAY THAT DOES NOT DO MORE

02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:35.534
HARM THAN GOOD- AS WE GO

02:04:35.601 --> 02:04:38.437
FORWARD THANK YOU- FOR YOUR

02:04:38.504 --> 02:04:42.508
TESTIMONY AND REGARD ONE OF

02:04:42.575 --> 02:04:46.078
THOSE WHAT REMAINS REPRESENTS A

02:04:46.145 --> 02:04:48.747
PERSON REPRESENTS FAMILIES AND

02:04:48.814 --> 02:04:52.651
IN MANY CASES- SO I THINK EVEN

02:04:52.718 --> 02:04:54.920
IN TESTIMONY SHOWING- THAT

02:04:54.987 --> 02:04:56.121
PROPER RESPECT FOR THE

02:04:56.188 --> 02:04:58.591
INDIVIDUAL THAT'S LOST RIGHT

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:00.993
THERE'S EVEN AT AT HALF A

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.395
PERCENT OF 1% OF THE MARKET

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:05.831
THAT'S STILL A LARGE PERCENTAGE

02:05:05.898 --> 02:05:08.400
OF A MISSING. NATIVE AMERICAN

02:05:08.467 --> 02:05:11.337
REMAINS THAT WILL NEVER BE ABLE

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:13.606
TO BE REPATRIATED BACK INTO THE

02:05:13.672 --> 02:05:17.076
GROUND AND SO IF WE COULD GET A

02:05:17.142 --> 02:05:19.044
LITTLE BIT MORE FOLLOW UP ON

02:05:19.111 --> 02:05:22.815
MORE DATA ON THE MISSING- ITEMS

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:25.084
THAT CAN NO LONGER BE FOUND.

02:05:25.150 --> 02:05:25.584
BUT ALSO IF YOU COULD A

02:05:25.651 --> 02:05:29.154
ADDRESS- THAT THE TOPIC OF

02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:30.756
UNKNOWN RIGHT WHEN SOMEONE

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:33.092
DOESN'T KNOW IT IN YOUR

02:05:33.158 --> 02:05:34.860
ESTABLISHMENT WHERE THEY DON'T

02:05:34.927 --> 02:05:36.762
KNOW WHERE A CULTURAL

02:05:36.829 --> 02:05:38.530
AFFILIATION IS ARE THEY STILL

02:05:38.597 --> 02:05:40.666
MATT MISS CLASSIFYING. THOSE

02:05:40.733 --> 02:05:43.702
REMAINS TO GOING TO A- AN AREA

02:05:43.769 --> 02:05:49.441
OF UNKNOWN. SO IF I COULD- TRY

02:05:49.508 --> 02:05:51.510
TAKING ANSWER- THE FIRST POINT

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:53.445
THAT THAT YOU RAISED- CHAIRMAN

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:56.749
RAY MOST. I DO I DON'T WANT TO

02:05:56.815 --> 02:05:58.083
LEAVE YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION

02:05:58.150 --> 02:06:00.386
THAT THESE ITEMS ARE

02:06:00.452 --> 02:06:03.923
IRREVOCABLY LOST- AS YOU CAN

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.524
IMAGINE IN ANY ANY SORT OF

02:06:05.591 --> 02:06:07.626
LARGE COLLECTION. THINK OF IT

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:09.228
AS I MEAN IT'S NOT REALLY THE

02:06:09.295 --> 02:06:12.665
APPROPRIATE ANALOGY I I'M AND I

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:13.933
AM TRYING TO BE VERY SENSITIVE

02:06:13.999 --> 02:06:16.302
HERE. BUT THINK OF IT ALONG THE

02:06:16.368 --> 02:06:18.871
LINES OF A- A FILE THAT HAS

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:20.406
BEEN YOU KNOW A PIECE OF PAPER

02:06:20.472 --> 02:06:22.341
THAT HAS BEEN MIS FILED. I

02:06:22.408 --> 02:06:23.609
DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:25.344
THEY'RE THEY'RE LOST FOREVER

02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:28.614
THAT OUR INVENTORY AND WHAT WE

02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:31.951
HAVE UNDER OUR CARE ARE NOT IN

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:33.519
ONE FOUR ONE CORRESPONDENCE.

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:35.888
BUT WERE WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:38.257
THAT. IF WE SEARCHED WE COULD

02:06:38.324 --> 02:06:40.292
FIND IT. BUT WE HAVE TO BE

02:06:40.359 --> 02:06:41.860
CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE SEARCH FOR

02:06:41.927 --> 02:06:44.430
THESE THINGS BECAUSE IN LOOKING

02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:46.632
FOR THESE THESE MESS MISSED

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:49.134
ITEMS WE MIGHT DO MORE HARM

02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:50.636
THAN GOOD SO WE NEED TO DO THIS

02:06:50.703 --> 02:06:51.470
IN A WAY WHICH IS VERY

02:06:51.537 --> 02:06:52.972
CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND IN

02:06:53.038 --> 02:06:54.573
COLLABORATION WITH THE TRIBES.

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:57.943
AGAIN I AGREE WITH YOU- IT

02:06:58.010 --> 02:07:01.480
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE ITEMS

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:03.248
AGAIN NOT NOT THE BEST

02:07:03.315 --> 02:07:06.952
TERMINOLOGY TO USE PERHAPS- IS

02:07:07.019 --> 02:07:09.321
IT BUT IS THERE'S A DESCENDANTS

02:07:09.388 --> 02:07:11.557
WHO WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THAT

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:14.426
AND- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:07:14.493 --> 02:07:16.462
GET OUR BOOKKEEPING IN ORDER

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:18.630
IF. WE ARE ABLE TO FIND THESE

02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:20.833
ITEMS BUT IT I DON'T WANT YOU

02:07:20.899 --> 02:07:21.433
TO COME AWAY WITH THE THOUGHT

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:23.669
OF. WILL NEVER FIND THEM

02:07:23.736 --> 02:07:25.204
THEY'RE GONE FOREVER EVER THERE

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:27.239
IN OUR COLLECTION BUT WHERE

02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:29.508
EXACTLY IN OUR COLLECTION IS

02:07:29.575 --> 02:07:31.643
WHERE THE SORT OF MISSING ITEM

02:07:31.710 --> 02:07:34.680
ISSUE KIND OF COMES UP NOW THE

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:37.850
OTHER THAT YOU RAISED IS ABOUT-

02:07:37.916 --> 02:07:40.519
THE CULTURAL AFFILIATION AND

02:07:40.586 --> 02:07:42.388
THE ISSUES OF THE HOW TO

02:07:42.454 --> 02:07:45.024
CLASSIFY THAT THOSE YOU KNOW

02:07:45.090 --> 02:07:45.591
TEN THOUSAND SETS OF HUMAN

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:48.093
REMAINS- SUMMER CULTURALLY

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:51.663
AFFILIATED SOME ARE. FOLLOWING

02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:53.298
KIND OF STRICT LEGAL

02:07:53.365 --> 02:07:56.668
TERMINOLOGY WERE DECIDED TO BE-

02:07:56.735 --> 02:07:59.004
NOT AFFILIATED UP WE'VE

02:07:59.071 --> 02:08:01.006
COMPLETELY CHANGED OUR APPROACH

02:08:01.073 --> 02:08:03.342
TO THIS- WE'RE TAKING INTO

02:08:03.409 --> 02:08:05.377
ACCOUNT THINGS LIKE OF THAT THE

02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:07.479
THINGS THAT WE KNOW. WHERE WE
