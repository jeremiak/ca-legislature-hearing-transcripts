00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:24.802
THIS POPULATION.

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:27.238
BUT MORE WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:30.508
AND THE THREE KEY STEPS BEFORE

THAT THAT SUPPORTS THE THE

00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:57.835
MISSION AND I SEE THAT AS A

00:33:57.902 --> 00:33:59.036
CULTURE.

00:33:59.103 --> 00:34:01.639

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.540
SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THAT

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:53.144
LAWSUIT ENDED AND SEVERAL YEARS

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.911
FROM CURRENT STATE.

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:55.413
SO IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW EFFECTIVE

00:36:55.479 --> 00:36:56.514
THE CURRENT PROGRAMS IN.

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:57.748
DE TODAY ARE AT REHABILITATING

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:59.550
YOUTH.

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:00.785
IN ADDITION WE WOULD WANT TO

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:01.552
CONSIDER ONE OF THE POTENTIAL

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:03.487
BENEFITS OF ITS REORGANIZATION.

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.655
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MENTIONED

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:06.090
SEVERAL POTENTIAL BENEFITS

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:06.724
HOWEVER IT'S NOT GOING TO CLEAR

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:08.092
HOW THESE BENEFITS WOULD BE

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:10.061
OPERATIONALIZED.

00:37:10.127 --> 00:37:11.662
AND THE NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:12.630
ONE OF THE POTENTIAL

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:13.798
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS

00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:16.801
REORGANIZATION.

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:18.069
WITHOUT KNOWING HOW THE CAN

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.103
OPERATIONALIZE THESE BENEFITS

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.071
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THAT WOULD

00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:21.305
BE IMPROVEMENTS TO

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:22.440
REHABILITATION.

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.075
IN ADDITION IT COULD LEAD TO

00:37:24.141 --> 00:37:25.710
INCREASED COSTS STUDENT THE NEED

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:26.944
TO DUPLICATE.

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:29.113
EFFORTS ARE CURRENTLY SHARED

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.915
WITH YOU SEE OUR ON THE

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:31.415
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:33.317
CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION.

00:37:33.384 --> 00:37:34.585
AND THAT NO COULD ALSO BE

00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:36.988
POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:38.923
COMPLICATING THE COORDINATION

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.257
BETWEEN.

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:43.394
DJJ NCDC ARW.

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:44.662
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE WANT TO

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:46.097
CONSIDER WHETHER THE ALTERNATIVE

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:47.898
ORGANIZATIONAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE.

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:49.266
WE LOOKED AT HOW OTHER STATES

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:50.568
HAVE ORGANIZED -- JUVENILE

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:52.703
JUSTICE SYSTEMS.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.537
AND WHILE MANY STATES HAVE HAD

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:54.905
THE OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS

00:37:54.972 --> 00:37:56.374
UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.174
SERVICES AGENCY.

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:58.609
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE

00:37:58.676 --> 00:37:59.443
ABOUT HALF THE STATES WHO HAD

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.646
THIS MODEL HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:03.347
IT TO MOVE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:04.782
SYSTEM PRIMARILY INTO EITHER ONE

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:05.816
INDEPENDENT DEPARTMENT THAT'S

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.084
NOT UNDER AN AGENCY.

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:11.155
OR INTO -- AGENCY THAT SPECIFIC

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:14.025
TO YOUTH AND FAMILY -- IN

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:16.027
ADDITION ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE

00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:16.560
TO POTENTIALLY REALIGN THE

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:18.229
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:19.764
COMPLETELY TO THE COUNTIES.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.433
CURRENTLY ABOUT 13% OF THE YOUTH

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.868
WHO ARE IN -- CORRECTIONAL

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:26.837
FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA OUR HOUSE

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:29.206
IN THE STATE IN DJ THEIR MAIN

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:31.942
OUR HOUSE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL.

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:33.010
AND IN ADDITION BOTH THE STATE

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:35.146
FACILITIES AND COUNTY FACILITIES

00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:36.180
ARE.

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:37.748
GENERALLY OUT ABOUT A THIRD OF

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.183
THE TOTAL CAPACITY.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.818
REALIGNING THE YOUTH TO THE

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:42.053
COUNTY LEVEL.

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:44.655
COULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF COST

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.090
SAVINGS BOTH FOR THE STATE AND

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:50.661
THE COUNTIES AS WELL AS GET PUT

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:51.495
IN THE YOUTH CLOSER TO THOSE.

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:52.563
SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS A

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.600
FAMILY -- ANOTHER.

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:57.501
QUESTION WE WANT TO RAISE IS

00:38:57.568 --> 00:38:58.035
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.904
APPROPRIATE USE OF BUDGET TRAVEL

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:03.407

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:05.009
THAT PRIMARY REORGANIZATIONS

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:06.444

AT THAT SALAS BY STATUTE IT'S

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.751
NOT CLEAR WHY THIS

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:15.986
REORGANIZATION SHOULD GO THROUGH

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:19.223
TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION INSTEAD --

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:20.291

WE THINK IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:18.903
WHILE WE ARE IN THIS PERIOD OF

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:20.938

A WE'RE NOT OPPOSING THIS WE WE

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.198
THINK THOUGH THAT WORK WE HAVE

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:50.634
SOME CONCERNS ONE IS THAT

00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.403

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.952
THERE'S AN ECONOMY OF SCALE IN A

00:44:39.777 --> 00:44:41.578
OF THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE DJJ INTO

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:43.113

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.316
BUT WITH CONCERN THAT -- A NAME

00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:48.385
CHANGE ALONE WILL NOT.

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:51.355
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE DAILY LIFE

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:52.489

REPORT LOOKING AT CURRENT

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:58.395
CONDITIONS AT DJJ AND FOUND THAT

00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:00.431
THEY REMAIN UNSAFE AND

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:03.267
FUNDAMENTALLY NON REHABILITATIVE.

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:04.768
AND THAT'S DUE TO FACTORS THAT

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:08.839
ARE REALLY ENDEMIC TO CONGREGATE

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:10.174

HUMAN SERVICES A SEARCH GREATER

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:27.791

GOOD AFTERNOON SUPER RAIL AND

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.067
I'M WITH THE PACIFIC JUVENILE

DEFENDER CENTER WE'VE BEEN

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:40.437
WORKING WITH THE TEN BY TEN

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:42.406
WORKING GROUP AND WORKED ON THE

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:45.075
LANGUAGE THAT WERE SUBMITTING --

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:47.411
DID TO FOR INCLUSION IN PROPOSED

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.246
INCLUSION IN THE TRAILER BILL WE

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:52.015
SUPPORT THE MOVE OF H. OF DJ TO

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:54.985
HHS BUT WE ALSO AS OTHERS HAVE

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:55.552
SAID.

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:56.987
I THINK THAT IT'SONLY A PART OF

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:58.689
THE PICTURE WE SUPPORT THE STAFF

00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:01.358
RECOMMENDATION. FOR A TASK FORCE

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:02.559
THAT WILL LOOK BOTH THAT THE

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:05.562
TRANSITION OF DJJ ITSELF AND THE

00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:08.098
TRANSFORMATION OF DJJ INTO

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:09.500
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN WE

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:11.502
NOW HAVE IT IT SEEMS LIKE THE

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:12.836
PERFECT TIME TO DO THAT.

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:14.438
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT WILL WORK

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:16.540
VERY WELL IN HHS BUT WE ALSO

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:18.775
THINK THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR A

00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:21.211
MUCH BIGGER POLICY PRESENCE AT

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.179
THE STATE LEVEL THAN WE

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:23.947
CURRENTLY HAVE ALL WE HAVE RIGHT

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:26.049

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:38.195
THERE.

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:40.597
AND WE THINK THAT THERE WE WE

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:42.032
MUST BE ONE OF THE ONLY STATES

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:43.901
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A STATE LEVEL

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:47.004
POLICY AGENCY -- AND SINCE DJJ

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.505

OF JUVENILE JUSTICE OUT OF THE

00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:19.129
ADULT CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM -- I I

00:48:19.196 --> 00:48:21.298
DO WANT TO REFLECT UPON KIND OF

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:22.499
THE WHAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:24.835
ABOUT MOVING -- DJJ AT THE STATE

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:26.870
LEVEL THAT IS AN APPROACH THAT

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:28.639
WE RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND --

00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:30.140
IT'S IT ALIGNS VERY MUCH ¢H

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:31.742
HOW PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:48:31.808 --> 00:48:34.144
STRUCTURED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL --

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:35.646
A SIMILARLY WHICH OPERATES

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:37.147
DISTINCT FROM AT THE ADULT

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:38.148
CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM SO IT'S

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:39.182
CERTAINLY AN APPROACH THAT WE

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:40.450
APPRECIATE UNDERSTAND AND

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:42.019
BELIEVE THERE'S THERE TO BE

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:44.554
BENEFITS -- TO I DO WANT TO TAKE

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:45.689
JUST A MOMENT I THINK IT'S VERY

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:46.723
IMPORTANT -- TO REITERATE AND

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.058
HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:49.626
OF WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE OVER

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:51.028
THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES OF

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.963
PROBATION CHIEFS AND AND MANY OF

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.231
OUR OUR STATE LOCAL PARTNERS.

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.532
HAVE DONE SIGNIFICANT WORK TO

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.634
REALLY LEAD AN EVOLUTION OF

00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:59.069
GETTING CALIFORNIA TO A PLACE

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:00.337
WHERE WE HAVE THE LOWEST A

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:01.638
JUVENILE ARREST RATES AND

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:03.473
DETENTION RATES -- IN OUR

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.107
HISTORY AND IT'S IT'S SOMETHING

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:05.842
THAT I THINK -- WE ALWAYS WANT

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:07.144
TO LOOK TO HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.812
BUILD UPON THAT AND ENHANCE --

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:10.047
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT I THINK WHEN

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:11.682
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT HIS

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:13.216
CHANGE MEANS KIND OF IN THE

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:15.218
CURRENT CONSTRUCT -- DOT SHE

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:20.924

COUNTIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND

00:49:28.598 --> 00:49:29.299
SO I THINK AS WORKS WERE

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:31.034
THINKING ABOUT -- MOVING FORWARD

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:32.602
ON THIS PROPOSAL IT'S IT'S VERY

00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:34.604
IMPORTANT -- TO THE CHIEFS THAT

00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:36.139
WE CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON THAT

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:37.207
DIALOGUE KNOWING THAT THEY ARE

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:38.809

AFFECTION WITH THIS CHANGE -- IN

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:42.779
A WAY THAT PROTECTS PUBLIC

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:44.481
SAFETY -- BUILDS UPON THE

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:45.716
REHABILITATIVE GOALS IN ALL OF

MS RUBIO.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:01.725
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:02.626

00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:03.193
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES AN

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.227
INCREASE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND%

00:51:04.294 --> 00:51:05.061
SIXTY YOUTH.

00:51:05.128 --> 00:51:07.464
ARE IN THE SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:08.465

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:17.407
ANYONE -- JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:20.277
NOT ASKED ME INCREASE OF SEVEN

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:21.545
HUNDRED AND SIXTY THE YOUTH.

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:24.047
WE'RE ESTIMATING AN INCREASE TO

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:24.581
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTIETH

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:25.081
ROUGHLY.

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.683
SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY MORE

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.351
LIKE AN INCREASE OF ABOUT SIXTY

00:51:28.418 --> 00:51:30.287
OR SEVENTY IN THE BUDGET YEAR

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:31.455
THAT WE'RE PROJECTING.

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:32.255
BUT THERE'S AN INCREASE YES AND

00:51:32.322 --> 00:51:35.959
THAT IS PRIMARILY RELATED.

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.160
TO EXCUSE ME THE YOUNG ADULT

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:38.161
OFFENDER PROGRAM.

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:42.332
WHICH IS IS DESIGNED TO DIVERT --

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:43.567
INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD HAVE

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:44.401
OTHERWISE WENT INTO THE ADULT

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:47.504
CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM -- TO DJJ

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.239
WHERE THEY CAN RECEIVE MORE

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:52.843
ROBUST REHABILITATIVE SERVICES --

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:56.012
WE RECOGNIZE THAT DJJ IS --

00:51:56.079 --> 00:52:00.150
BETTER SUITED TO DEAL WITH.

00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:01.818
FOLKS YOUNGER OFFENDERS THEIR

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:02.986
PSYCHOLOGY IS DIFFERENT THAN

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:04.521
ADULT OFFENDERS THE RESPOND

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:05.689
DIFFERENTLY TO PROGRAMMING AND

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:08.558
SO THE IDEA WAS TO TO PUT THOSE

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:11.328
INDIVIDUALS IN IN DJJ WHERE THEY

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:12.662
WOULD RECEIVE ARE.

00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:13.897
MORE APPROPRIATE SERVICES.

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:18.468
AND THAT'S THE PRIMARY REASON

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:18.969
FOR THE INCREASE IN THE

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.570
POPULATION [inaudible]

BECAUSE I I I I WAS A CERTAIN

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:03.647
FOR TEN YEARS I'VE SEEN ALL

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:04.214

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.532

LA.

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:29.472
WELL I THINK THAT.

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:31.308
FUNDAMENTALLY [inaudible]

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.410
WE ARE.

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:36.146
DOUBLING DOWN ON THE MISSION.

00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:38.915
OF AND THIS IS ACTUALLY IN THE

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:41.251
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OF HELPING

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:43.520
YOUTH WHO HAVE HURT PEOPLE.

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:45.322
AND IT DIDN'T HURT THEMSELVES.

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:46.923
RETURN SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.725

THAT NOW FROM WHERE YOU'RE AT

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:59.402
VERSUS CHANGING DEPARTMENT WELL

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:01.871
I THINK THAT BY A VERSUS

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:02.939
CREATING YOU KNOW IT THE AND YOU

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:04.274
COULD DO THAT FOR RIGHT NOW

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:05.342
TODAY [inaudible]

00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:07.877
SO.

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:10.246
THE IDEA IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:10.814
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.483
THAT.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.685
DJJ SHOULD BE THE LAST STOP IN

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:16.720
THAT SYSTEM THE NEXT STOP SHOULD

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:19.522
NOT BE A CELL ON THE ADULT SIDE.

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:20.991
AND THAT.

00:54:21.057 --> 00:54:22.258
IT MEANS THAT.

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:23.493
DOMINANTLY THE LENS THROUGH

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.861
WHICH WE LOOK THROUGH HIS

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:28.565
REHABILITATION AS WELL AS

00:54:28.632 --> 00:54:29.799
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE.

00:54:29.866 --> 00:54:31.167
AT HEALTH PLANS IF YOU WILL.

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.802
AND IT JUST MAKES MORE SENSE

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:33.770
THAT.

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:36.573
THAT BE BASED IN AN AGENCY WHO

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.375
THAT TWO IS THE PREDOMINANT

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:40.510
MISSION AND FOCUS OF THAT AGENCY

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:41.911
SO ORGANIZATIONALLY AND MAKES

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:43.213
SENSE TO BE AN ORGAN WITHIN AN

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:44.247
ORGANIZATION.

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:45.649
THAT SHARES AND IS PREDOMINATELY

00:54:45.715 --> 00:54:47.217
ABOUT THE EXACT SAME MISSION

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:49.285
IMPERATIVE WHICH WE HAVE TO BE

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:50.020
ABLE.

00:54:50.086 --> 00:54:50.987
TO SERVE THESE YOU THE PROPERLY

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:51.821
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

00:54:51.888 --> 00:54:53.690
CAPABLE OF RETURNING SAFELY TO

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:54.958
THE COMMUNITY.

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:56.426
SECONDLY SO MANY OF THE

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:59.629
RESOURCES AND SERVICES THAT ARE

00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:00.964
APPROPRIATE AND FOR THE

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:02.565
POPULATION THAT WE ARE

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:04.167
ATTEMPTING TO SERVE.

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:05.035
OUR HOUSE WITHIN.

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:06.336
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:07.671
HUMAN SERVICES.

00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:09.172
AND BY BEING WITHIN THE

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:11.441
ORGANIZATION WE STRONGLY BELIEVE

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:12.008
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE FAR

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:14.711
GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR CLOSE.

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.379
COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:18.048
WITH THOSE SERVICES THAN BEING

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:24.154
WITHIN CDC ARE.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.056
BUT YOU IS THE DIRECTOR DON'T

00:55:26.122 --> 00:55:27.424
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:32.162
THAT MISSION.

00:55:32.228 --> 00:55:33.396
WITHOUT CHANGING DEPARTMENTS

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:33.697
[inaudible]

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:35.832
CERTAINLY.

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.000
I HAVE YOU KNOW ISN'T IT WITHIN

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:38.968
YOUR POWER TO DO THAT. TO CHASE

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:40.070
MISSION ABSOLUTELY BEEN TERMS

00:55:40.136 --> 00:55:41.204
THE ORGANIZATIONAL SETTING THAT

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:42.772
WOULD NOT BE IN MY PURVIEW TO BE

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:43.907
ABLE TO DO THAT AND I THINK THE

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:45.341
GOVERNOR BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT.

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:46.876
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT

00:55:46.943 --> 00:55:48.511
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS

00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:50.246
WITHIN THE ADULT PRISON SYSTEM

00:55:50.313 --> 00:55:51.047
WHEN THE MISSION OF THE

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:53.583
ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE TO HELP

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.317
GET THE YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:55:54.384 --> 00:55:55.685
OUT OF THE CRIMINAL GANGS IN THE

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:56.619
NAME ON THE WALL IS GOING TO

00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.922
CHANGE HOW THE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH

00:55:58.988 --> 00:56:02.759
YOU OFFER A THAT THAT COMES FROM

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:05.228
THE TOP THAT COMES FROM YOU SIR.

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:06.629
ABSOLUTELY AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW

00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:08.698
A WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.900
THAT I BELIEVE WOULD BE.

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:13.203
MORE EASILY IMPLEMENTED.

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:13.937
WITHIN A HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:15.438
SERVICES HEALTH AND HUMAN

I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:33.443

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:54.030
FELT STRONGLY ABOUT HAVING A

00:58:54.097 --> 00:58:56.332
LONGER TRANSITION HAVING THE

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:58.201

IS THAT.

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:12.615
MOST EVERYONE AGREES.

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:14.384
THAT THIS IS A GOOD THING.

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:15.585
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS A

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:18.755
GOOD THING -- ART USE FROM ONE

00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:20.189
DEPARTMENT TO ANOTHER SO YOU

00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:22.191
DON'T HAVE THE DUPLICATION NOT

00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:25.662
TRYING TO BRING IN DHHS OVER.

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:29.666

00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:32.969
NOW BE HOUSED UNDER -- DHHS

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:33.269
[inaudible]

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:36.105
BUT THE TRANSITION.

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:38.041
HOUSE TO BE A GOOD TRANSITION SO

00:59:38.107 --> 00:59:38.741
THAT.

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:40.643
GOING BACK TO THE COMMENTS FROM

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:43.313
MR MATHESON -- MISTER FRAZIER

00:59:43.379 --> 00:59:43.947
THERE WERE SURE THAT THERE'S A

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:44.881
CHANGE.

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:47.450
IN THE CULTURE SO THAT IT ISN'T

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:49.819
JUST TO HELP HOUSING THEM IN ONE

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:51.187
DEPARTMENT SOMETHING UP TO

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:51.821
ANOTHER.

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:53.156
AND THEN LATER TRYING TO FIGURE

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:54.190
OUT WITH THE CHANGING CULTURE IS

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:55.024
GOING TO BE.

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.359
BUT TO BE SURE THAT YOUR

00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:59.028
INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE CHANGE IN

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:01.431
THE CULTURE OF HOW THE YOUTH ARE

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:03.366
GOING TO BE TREATED -- THE

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:07.971
SERVICE IS GOING TO BE PROVIDED.

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:09.472
IT IT IT AND ON AND ON I THINK

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:11.174
THAT.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.310
THE TRANSITION HAS THE CAPACITY

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:16.245
AND THE POWER TO SET THE TONE

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.914
FOR YOUTH RESTORATION WHICH IS

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.215
REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:22.552
AND YES THE TITLE OF THE PROGRAM.

01:00:22.618 --> 01:00:24.087
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT A

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:25.688
CÃM.

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:26.889
IF YOU ARE.

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:30.693
IT PROGRAM THAT IS CALLED.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.963
LET ME FIND MY NOTES.

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.732
THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:36.966
COMMUNITY RESTORATION.

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:38.735
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN TO BE

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.203
HOUSED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:41.604
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS.

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:43.206
AND REHABILITATION.

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.440
AND I THINK THAT -- IT'S

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:47.343
SOMETHING THAT -- IS IS PROPERLY

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.479
NOTED THAT WE THAT IS SOMETHING

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:49.679
THAT.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:52.015
WE WOULD WANT.

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.316
THE PURPOSE IS TO CHANGE AND

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.885
IMPROVE THESE YOUNG LIVES AND I

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:58.521
THINK THAT -- THE CHANGE WOULD

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.523
BE GOOD TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:03.226
NEGATIVE AND TOXIC PRACTICES.

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:05.194
THAT OUR CONSTRUCTIVE.

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:07.196
IN THE INTEREST OF HOPEFULNESS

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.198
AND PERSONAL CAPACITY OF THESE

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.768
YOUNG CALIFORNIANS.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:16.139
I DO WANT TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU --

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:17.607
SPECIFIC IT AND APPRECIATE THAT

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:19.642
WE DID RECEIVE THAT THE TRAILER

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:22.945
BILL LANGUAGE ALSO -- THAT.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.914
THAT WILL FRAME THE FIRST STEPS

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.216
FOR THIS TRANSITION.

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:28.851
BUT A FEW QUESTIONS.

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:30.987
IS THE ADMINISTRATION AMENABLE

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:33.990
TO SLIGHTLY LONGER TIME FRAME.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:36.392
SPECIFICALLY AN ADDITIONAL YEAR

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.660
FOR CONSTRUCTION THE BASES OF

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:39.328
THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND HOW IT

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:44.333
WILL FUNCTION.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.769
SO I THINK YOU KNOW LEE

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:47.370

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:48.571

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:05.408
FEEDBACK ON RECOMMENDED CHANGES.

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.310
TO THE ADMINISTRATION --

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:08.444
SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.812
TRAILER BILL.

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:14.951

LEFT BUT I THINK IT IS.

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:31.567
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:35.204
HEARD FROM SO MANY STAKEHOLDERS --

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:37.073
AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.008
HAS BEEN A TASK FORCE THAT THIS

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:42.678
IS NOT SOMETHING NEW.

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:43.613
BUT I THINK THAT IT'S SOMETHING

01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:45.114
THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE -- AS

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:48.918

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:53.022

SURE THE REST OF THE THE MEMBERS

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:57.693
WOULD LIKE.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.096
TO REMAIN INFORMED -- AS A

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:01.731

GATHERING THE INFORMATION.

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:08.004
SO THAT WE DO PUT THE

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.138
APPROPRIATE TRAILER BILL

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:14.844
LANGUAGE. FOR THIS TRANSITION.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.379
BUT AGAIN I DO WANT TO SAY THAT

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:19.248
I'M VERY GLAD ABOUT THE PROPOSAL.

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:21.250
I DON'T I'VE HEARD VERY FEW

FROM THOSE SAYING THAT IT IS NOT

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:26.355
A GOOD THING.

WE DO NEED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:30.059
THOUGH AND I THINK THAT.

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.694
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:33.296
LEADERSHIP.

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:36.165

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:52.133
DEPARTMENTAL EFFORT TO TAKE THE

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.235
MEDS SYSTEM WHICH STORES --

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:56.871

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:58.373
AND NUMEROUS -- PUBLICLY

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.342

PROGRAMS ACROSS -- MULTIPLE

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:02.977
DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE OF

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:03.778
CALIFORNIA.

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:05.680
THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:08.083
THAT IT HAS -- LAID ON TOP OF OR

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:10.051
SORRY THAT IT'S MADE FROM REALLY

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:11.519
GOES BACK TO THE EARLY SEVENTIES --

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:14.489
IT WAS ORIGINALLY IMPLEMENTED IN

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:15.323
NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE I BELIEVE.

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:18.059
AND SO THAT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:20.161
WHAT I READ THE YEAH WE'RE A

01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:21.563
LITTLE YOU KNOW.

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:22.163
WE'RE A LITTLE OUT OF DATE --

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:23.231
THOUGH THAT THE SYSTEM RUNS VERY

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:25.500
WELL -- AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:26.835
BUT IT'S NOT FLEXIBLE WITH

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:28.403
REGARDS TO SOME OF THE INTER

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:29.070
OPERABILITY IS THAT WE'RE

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.272
LOOKING OUT FOR CROSS PROGRAMS

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:34.309
ACROSS STATE -- WHEN IT COMES --

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:34.876
TO YOU KNOW INTERACTIVITY.

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.344
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:38.246
WITH THIS EFFORT IS TO TAKE BY

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:41.349
FACE STARTING WITH THE HEALTH

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:42.851
INFORMATION SYSTEM.

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.419

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:51.926
EFFORT THAT WILL BE MULTI YEAR --

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:54.229
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS IS

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:56.731
WE WANT TO A DO SOME LEARNING --

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:57.632
AS WERE DOING MODULAR NOT ONLY

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.601
THAT BUT E WANT TO ENSURE THAT

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:00.468
WE'RE MOVING METHODICALLY

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:03.037
UNDERSTANDING TO MINIMIZE THE

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:04.806
LAST THING WE WANT IS ANY IMPACT

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:07.475
BENEFICIARIES AS WORKS MOVING.

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:08.777
UP INFORMATION OR INNER

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:09.944
CONNECTIVE ITTY WITH THE SIZE

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:11.746
AND CAL HERE'S AS ARE

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:13.448
MODERNIZING AT NOT ONLY THAT WE

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:14.816
WANT TO REDUCE IMPACT FOR COUNTY

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.284

BUSINESS PROCESS SEES.

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:30.098

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:30.465
LEVEL.

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:31.099

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:03.878
WE WOULD END UP LOSING CONTRACT

THIS PROOF OF CONCEPT THE WHOLE

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:05.279
THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF HAVING THIS

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:06.914
IS PART OF THE POWER IS TO LEARN

ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE'VE MADE ARE

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:12.186
THEY ACCURATE DO THEY NEED TO BE

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:13.621
TWEAKED A BIT BEFORE WE HAVE AN

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:15.957
APPROVED PROJECTS SO OUR GOAL.

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.458
IS VERY MUCH IN ALIGNMENT WITH

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:19.260
YOURS WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT WE

PROJECT OFF ON THE STRONGEST

01:33:22.563 --> 01:33:28.102
FOOTING WE CAN'T -- SO.

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:29.670
IN THE IN THAT REGARD THAT

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:30.771
THAT'S THE INSURANCE I CAN GIVE

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.206
IS THAT THAT'S THE WORK WE'RE

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:32.807
DOING IS.

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:33.474
TO DO AS MUCH AS PROACTIVELY AS

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:34.608
POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THE

PROJECT IS SUCCESSFUL AND I'M

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:36.711
NOT TRYING.

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:39.847
TO DIMINISH YOUR YOUR OF VIGOR.

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:40.414
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD US

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.083
BEFORE.

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:43.417

WE HAVE.

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:47.588

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:58.132
AGENCIES THEN WE HAVE TO PUT

01:33:58.199 --> 01:33:59.700
BANDAIDS ON AND THEN I HAVE TO

01:33:59.767 --> 01:34:01.535
PUT MORE MONEY INTO IT.

01:34:01.602 --> 01:34:03.471
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:07.641
AND THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE

01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:10.945

WE FOUND IN LARGER.

01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:54.628
PROJECTS THAT WHEN YOU INTEGRATE

A PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE THAT

01:39:03.037 --> 01:39:04.371
ACTUALLY CAN COME THROUGH AND

01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:07.608
SAY -- THE AND VALIDATE LIKE

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:10.611
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT AT THE

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:12.746
STOP GAP.

01:39:12.813 --> 01:39:15.282
BONUS -- UNBIASED ON A BASH TO

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:17.751
READY TO GO WITH THE INFORMATION

AND YOU KNOW.

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:21.989
IS THERE ANY KIND OF OF PURPOSE

01:39:22.056 --> 01:39:23.324
OR ANY COMMITTEE LIKE THAT

01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:24.358
APPEAR REVIEW COMMITTEE I I I

01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:26.126
WOULD ANSWER IT THIS WAY THE HHS

01:39:26.193 --> 01:39:27.795
AGENCY IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE.

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:28.595
THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS

01:39:28.662 --> 01:39:30.197
INTEGRATION IN OUR AGENCY

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:31.765
ACTUALLY KIND OF PERFORMS THAT

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:32.599
FUNCTION BECAUSE THEY'RE THE

01:39:32.666 --> 01:39:34.168
PROJECT MANAGER ON BEHALF OF ALL

01:39:34.234 --> 01:39:35.869
THE PROJECT SO THEY HAVE THE

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:37.004
VISIBILITY TO THAT.

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:38.305
THAT'S IN ADDITION TO OUTSIDE

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:40.507
VENDORS LIKE IVY ENVY OR THE

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:42.643
INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:43.610
CONSULTANTS THAT WE TALKED AYE

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:45.112
POCK THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:46.447
WE HAVE A COMBINATION OF THOSE

01:39:46.513 --> 01:39:47.881
THINGS.

01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:52.219
WHEN WE HIRE A VENDOR WE DON'T?

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:53.087
KIND OF PAY THEM PUT THEM IN A

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:54.488
ROOM AND NOT TALK TO THEM YOU

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:55.155
KNOW THAT'S LIKE ARE WE WILL IS

01:39:55.222 --> 01:39:56.290
WHAT WE'RE DOING MAKES SENSE HOW

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:57.458
WOULD YOU DO IT.

01:39:57.524 --> 01:39:59.159
WE'RE INCREASINGLY TRYING TO

01:39:59.226 --> 01:40:00.794
DEFINE THE OUTCOME OF WHAT WE

01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:02.963
WANT TO ACHIEVE AND NOT DEFINED

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:05.032
THE HOW YOU HAVE TO GET THEIR

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:07.301
WHICH IMPOSES A LIMIT AND ALLOWS

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:08.802
THAT CREATIVE THINKING AND THE

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:09.536
TWO WAY DIALOGUE.

01:40:09.603 --> 01:40:10.537
SO THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT

01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:12.706
WE'RE DOING CAN WE GUARANTEE

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.208
SUCCESS OF COURSE NOT.

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:15.909
CAN WE GUARANTEE TRANSPARENCY

01:40:15.976 --> 01:40:17.444
INTO A CLEAR DISCUSSION OF

01:40:17.511 --> 01:40:20.180
ISSUES AS THEY ARISE AND BEST

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:20.681
EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THEM

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:21.448
ABSOLUTELY.

01:40:21.515 --> 01:40:22.750
AND PARTICULARLY ON THE LARGE

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:24.084
PROJECTS THAT YOU'RE HEARING

01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:25.652
ABOUT TODAY WHAT WE'RE ASKING

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:27.888
FOR ADEQUATE STATE STAFF SUPPORT.

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:28.789
FOR WE FOUND THAT WHERE WERE

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.457
UNDER RESOURCE AND DON'T HAVE

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:32.326
THE SKILL SETS IS EXACTLY WHERE

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:34.228
THE PROBLEMS COME UP.

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:35.429
RIGHT.

01:40:35.496 --> 01:40:36.697
I APPRECIATE YOUR AND YOUR

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:37.698
SUPPORT AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN I

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:39.867
APPRECIATE YOU RECOGNIZING THAT.

01:40:39.933 --> 01:40:41.201
REVIEWS IS.

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:42.369
IMPORTANT PART OF THE YES

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:46.673
ABSOLUTELY IT IS THANKS.

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.941
THANK YOU.

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:49.410
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK AND WE TOOK

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:51.178
THE APPLICATION HUB FIRST FOR A

01:40:51.245 --> 01:40:52.112
REASON LIKE I DO WANT TO TO

01:40:52.179 --> 01:40:52.913
EXPLAIN.

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.681
HOW THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMEND

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:56.550
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE

01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:57.718
APPLICATION HUB?

01:40:57.785 --> 01:41:00.354
ARE INFLUENCING THE DESIGN

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:07.928
DEVELOPMENT -- AND IT'S BOND --

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:10.731
YEAH BARBARA WHO WANTS TO TALK

01:41:10.798 --> 01:41:11.732
ABOUT FIRST YEAR [inaudible]

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:14.268
OF THE FOR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:41:14.334 --> 01:41:15.335
ALTHOUGH AS MISS SMALL INDICATED

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.103
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:17.004
MEDS DOES THERE'S ACTUALLY I

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:19.406
THINK A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:20.407
HUNDRED EIGHTY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:21.642
THAT MET AND FOUGHT AND OTHER

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:23.644
DEPARTMENTS AND FUNCTIONS THAT

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:25.045
MEDS INTEROPERATES WITH.

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:29.016
SO IT'S A FAIRLY COMPLEX SYSTEM --

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:34.555
IT. FOR OUR PROGRAMS.

01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:35.589
IT'S VERY OFTEN THE THE SYSTEM

01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:37.558
OF RECORD -- WHETHER SOMEBODY'S

01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:39.059
BEEN ON AID WHICH AID CODES

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:41.061
THEY'VE BEEN AND AND AND SO WE

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:42.663
USE THAT IN OUR ELIGIBILITY

01:41:42.729 --> 01:41:44.198
PROCESS SEES.

01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:47.167
I THAT INPUT IS PROVIDED. TO THE

01:41:47.234 --> 01:41:49.403
MADS LARGELY FROM US -- AND AND

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.872
IT'S A LOOKUP FUNCTION FOR US.

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:53.373
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT LESS IN

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.808
TERMS OF THE APPLICATION HARD

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:56.410
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SYSTEM THAT

01:41:56.477 --> 01:41:57.978
ACTIVELY FOR US DETERMINING

01:41:58.045 --> 01:42:00.013
ELIGIBILITY ITS RECORDING

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.182
ELIGIBILITY.

01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:03.951
OVER TIME IN THE PROGRAM BLESS

01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:05.118
YOU THANK YOU.

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:05.986
AND ACROSS MULTIROTOR CROSS

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:08.155
MULTIPLE PROGRAM SO THE FUNCTION

01:42:08.222 --> 01:42:09.690
IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FOR US

01:42:09.756 --> 01:42:11.458
THE HUB IS MOSTLY CENTERED

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:13.460
AROUND THE SAUCE SYSTEMS WHICH

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:18.165
FOR MEDI CAL CAL FRESH -- I KEEP

01:42:18.232 --> 01:42:18.866
SAYING TEN F. BUT IT'S CAL WORKS --

01:42:18.932 --> 01:42:20.100
AND A VARIETY OF THE OTHER

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:24.137
PROGRAMS -- DEBT.

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:25.105
THE SAWS IS THE SYSTEM THAT'S

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:26.807
PROCESSING ELIGIBILITY THAT WILL

01:42:26.874 --> 01:42:29.376
BENEFIT THE MOST FROM FROM THE

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:29.776
HARM.

01:42:29.843 --> 01:42:32.312
BUT THE CLIENT CENTERED FOCUS

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:33.947
ARE WE GETTING WHAT WE NEED WHEN

01:42:34.014 --> 01:42:35.482
I THINK OF MADS AND I THINK OF

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:37.017
THE THE COUNTY USER FROM MY

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:38.519
DEPARTMENTS PERSPECTIVE IT'S THE

01:42:38.585 --> 01:42:41.021
COUNTY USER THAT'S THE CLIENT.

01:42:41.088 --> 01:42:42.890
AND ARE THEY ABLE TO GET WHAT

01:42:42.956 --> 01:42:44.525
THEY WANT RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE

01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:45.792
A LOT OF THE FUNCTIONALITY WE

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:47.194
NEED IS OVERNIGHT BATCH

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.428
PROCESSING.

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:49.696
SO THEY CAN'T ALWAYS GET AN

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:51.164
ANSWER WHEN THE CLIENT SITTING

01:42:51.231 --> 01:42:52.165
IN FRONT OF THEM.

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:53.267
AND THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THAT

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:56.537
WE CAN IN AT THE MOMENT IN TIME.

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:58.338
THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF WE WANT

01:42:58.405 --> 01:42:59.673
TO CHANGE AND A HOBBY IN REAL

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.108
TIME ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:02.109
WILL HELP.

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:03.810
MODERNIZING MADS PUTTING ON A

01:43:03.877 --> 01:43:06.246
PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS REAL TIME

01:43:06.313 --> 01:43:08.081
WILL BE OF ASSISTANCE TO US.

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:09.349
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU LIKE THE

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:10.617
HUB IS GOING TO DRAMATICALLY

01:43:10.684 --> 01:43:12.119
CHANGE THE MEDS BUT THE

01:43:12.185 --> 01:43:14.555
PRINCIPLE OF OUR USERS GETTING

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:16.623
WHAT THEY WANT IS WHAT I WOULD.

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:18.392
TELL YOU IS A CONNECTION I I

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:19.192
DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY WANTS TO

01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:19.726
ADD.

01:43:19.793 --> 01:43:21.161
THE ONLY OTHER THING I'D ADD IS

01:43:21.228 --> 01:43:23.697
THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:25.365
THE SYSTEMS ACROSS THE BOARD WE

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:28.402
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE.

01:43:28.468 --> 01:43:29.836
TO AS WE WERE WORKING ON THE

01:43:29.903 --> 01:43:31.371
DEVELOPMENT TAKE THE PICTURE.

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:33.440
INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE WE

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:34.641
HAVE MAD WE HAVE THE

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:36.710
VERIFICATION HAVE WE HAVE THE

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:39.947
SAWS WE HAVE CAL HEARERS AND WE

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:41.715
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS IN A

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:43.216
WORLD VALUE FOR ALL OF THOSE

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:44.117
SYSTEMS.

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:46.486
BUT WE ALSO MEANT WE THEN HAVE

HEARD OF GOAL ATTAINMENT THE

02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:33.693
RESEARCH SAYS IT'S A BETTER WAY

02:00:33.759 --> 02:00:35.861

SUPERVISORS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE

02:00:50.977 --> 02:00:53.279
THE LEARNING OF CAL WORKS TO

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:53.980
POINT OUT.

STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE

02:01:06.425 --> 02:01:07.326
SYSTEM.

02:01:07.393 --> 02:01:09.562

02:01:38.758 --> 02:01:40.259
THAT'S NOW BASED ON A DIFFERENT

02:01:40.326 --> 02:01:41.894
WAY OF ENGAGING IT'S IT'S A

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:44.063
MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.

02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:46.732
THAT WERE WORKING ON BOTH TO

02:11:46.798 --> 02:11:47.933
CLARIFY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.401
REPORTING ON THE PROGRESS AND

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:50.969
THE OUTCOMES WE WERE TALKING

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:52.004
ABOUT FORMAL REPORT.

02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:52.971
WE'RE HAPPY WITH THAT BEING AN

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:54.606
UPDATE TO THE LEGISLATURE JUST

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:56.108
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL

02:11:56.174 --> 02:11:57.909
ENGAGED IN INVOLVED -- AND

02:11:57.976 --> 02:11:59.378
MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WITHIN

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:02.414
TECHNOLOGY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:04.116
WITH AN EXISTING TECHNOLOGY OR

02:12:04.182 --> 02:12:05.484
MINIMIZING THE BURDENS OF THE

02:12:05.550 --> 02:12:07.219
ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND THAT THAT

02:12:07.286 --> 02:12:08.487
IS SORT OF THE GUIDING STAR.

02:12:08.553 --> 02:12:10.188
OF THESE WORK GROUPS BECAUSE I

02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:12.024
THINK THERE'S THIRTY FOUR

02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:13.492
DIFFERENT WORK GROUPS NOW WE

02:12:13.558 --> 02:12:14.926
CAN'T ALL BE IN ALL PLACES AT

02:12:14.993 --> 02:12:16.261
THAT TIME AND SO WHAT WE'RE

02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:17.963
HOPING THROUGH THIS IS THAT.

02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:19.698
AS CHANGES ARE MADE AS I. T.

02:12:19.765 --> 02:12:20.999
DECISIONS ARE MADE THAT WERE

02:12:21.066 --> 02:12:23.001
ASKING IS THIS DECISION ACTUALLY

02:12:23.068 --> 02:12:23.735
REDUCING THE BURDEN FOR THE

02:12:23.802 --> 02:12:25.737
CLIENT IT IS BEING DONE IN FOR

02:12:25.804 --> 02:12:27.239
MY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE.

02:12:27.306 --> 02:12:28.440
UNDERSTANDING MANY PEOPLE COMING

02:12:28.507 --> 02:12:29.508
TO THESE PROGRAMS ARE

02:12:29.574 --> 02:12:32.844
EXPERIENCING POVERTY TRAUMA A

02:12:32.911 --> 02:12:34.179
NUMBER OF CHALLENGES AND SO THE

02:12:34.246 --> 02:12:35.480
COSTS SERVE COGNITIVE LOAD

02:12:35.547 --> 02:12:37.149
BEHAVIORAL ATTENTION THE ABILITY

02:12:37.215 --> 02:12:39.084
TO NAVIGATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS CAN

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:40.585
BE MUCH HARDER FOR THESE CLIENTS.

02:12:40.652 --> 02:12:41.753
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:43.088
THE PROCESS LEADS TO THE

02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:44.990
OUTCOMES -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT

02:12:45.057 --> 02:12:46.124
THAT CAN BE CHALLENGE

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:47.359
CHALLENGING TO PUT INTO

02:12:47.426 --> 02:12:49.428
STATUTORY LANGUAGE AND SO WE'RE

02:12:49.494 --> 02:12:50.929
WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:52.698
HAVE PROCESS AND OUTCOMES THAT

02:12:52.764 --> 02:12:56.401
LEAD TO WHAT WE ALL WANT AT THE

02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:57.002
END OF THIS MULTI YEAR PROCESS

DON'T HAVE OBJECTIONS TO

02:13:06.311 --> 02:13:07.746
CODIFYING OF THIS I THINK WE'D

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:09.214
HAVE TO MINOR COMMENTS THAT AS

STAR -- IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN

02:13:13.018 --> 02:13:14.052
AS A MANDATE THAT THE SYSTEM

02:13:14.119 --> 02:13:15.887
SHALL WE THINK MAYBE EXPRESSING

02:13:15.954 --> 02:13:18.824
IT AS A GOAL WOULD BE HELPFUL.

02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:20.359
AND THERE'S A A REQUIREMENT IN

02:13:20.425 --> 02:13:22.361
AS THE DRAFT ON PAGE FORTY FIVE

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:24.596

AS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT TODAY --

02:13:29.167 --> 02:13:30.502
WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM

02:13:30.569 --> 02:13:31.903
REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:33.438
BECAUSE THERE'S A LONG FORMAL

02:13:33.505 --> 02:13:35.040
REVIEW PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:13:35.107 --> 02:13:35.574

02:18:57.495 --> 02:18:59.030
SPECIFICS OF THE DEVELOPMENT

02:18:59.097 --> 02:19:01.499
PROCESS -- AND HELP US WITH OUR

02:19:01.566 --> 02:19:02.901
FOCUS ON THE USER CENTERED

02:19:02.967 --> 02:19:04.669
DESIGN AND USER RESEARCH

02:19:04.736 --> 02:19:05.804
ACTIVITIES.

02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:07.639
IN ADDITION TO THAT THIS PAST

02:19:07.706 --> 02:19:09.274
YEAR WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT OTHER

02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:10.542
WAYS TO ACCELERATE THE

02:19:10.608 --> 02:19:13.678
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS EVENTUALLY.

02:19:13.745 --> 02:19:14.779
I THINK WHEN WE FIRST STARTED

02:19:14.846 --> 02:19:16.548
THIS PROJECT WE WERE A LITTLE

02:19:16.614 --> 02:19:18.550
NAIVE ABOUT HOW TO DO -- AGILE

02:19:18.616 --> 02:19:21.519
PROJECTS AND A LITTLE BIT NAIVE

02:19:21.586 --> 02:19:23.755
ON THE APPROACH TO BUILDING THIS

02:19:23.822 --> 02:19:25.290
SYSTEM -- USING CUSTOM

02:19:25.356 --> 02:19:26.991
DEVELOPMENT APPROACH AND THAT

02:19:27.058 --> 02:19:28.660
WAS WHAT PRECIPITATED THE

02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:30.261
RECOMMENDATION FROM A SEE WHY I

02:19:30.328 --> 02:19:31.730
HAVE TO DO ONE THING AT A TIME

02:19:31.796 --> 02:19:33.965
IN OTHER WORDS GET BETTER AT

02:19:34.032 --> 02:19:35.266
COMPLETING SOMETHING ALL THE WAY

02:19:35.333 --> 02:19:36.835
THROUGH DON'T START TOO MANY

02:19:36.901 --> 02:19:38.336
THINGS AT ONCE AND SO WE'VE

02:19:38.403 --> 02:19:38.636
TAKEN THAT.

02:19:38.703 --> 02:19:40.839
ADVICE TO HEART AND WE WANT TO

02:19:40.905 --> 02:19:42.674
CONTINUE THAT APPROACH INTO THE

02:19:42.741 --> 02:19:45.877
NEXT YEAR -- AND AND ALLOW US --

02:19:45.944 --> 02:19:47.245
TO SHOW AND DELIVER THE THING

02:19:47.312 --> 02:19:48.880
THE VALUE -- ESPECIALLY THE

02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:51.182
VALUE TO THE CHILD WELFARE

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.784
WORKERS AS WELL AS THE FAMILIES.

02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:54.452

02:19:54.519 --> 02:19:56.955
OBSERVATION AND AND FIGHT

02:19:57.021 --> 02:20:00.291

WELFARE SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT

02:20:11.669 --> 02:20:13.738
SYSTEM HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE --

02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:17.442
DEPLOYED TALK COUNTY SINCE --

02:20:17.509 --> 02:20:18.109
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT STARTED AS

02:20:18.176 --> 02:20:20.145
A PROJECT IN ABOUT NINETEEN

02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:21.312
NINETY TWO AND REPRESENTS -- THE

02:20:21.379 --> 02:20:23.081
STATE OF THE ART FOR NINETEEN

02:20:23.148 --> 02:20:24.716
EIGHTY NINE AND SO WHILE THERE

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:28.319
IS A DIRE NEED -- TO TO TO

02:20:28.386 --> 02:20:30.321

FIGURE OUT -- AS A PUBLIC SECTOR

02:21:05.256 --> 02:21:07.859
ENTITY HOW TO HOW TO BUILD

02:21:07.926 --> 02:21:10.094
SOFTWARE IN THE WAYS THAT --

02:21:10.161 --> 02:21:11.863
THAT PRIVATE INDUSTRY DOES BUT

02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:13.631
IN A IN A WAY THAT'S TRANSPARENT

PR BUT WANTED TO PROVIDE THOSE

02:24:00.832 --> 02:24:04.235
NOTES ABOUT THE NINETEEN TWENTY

02:24:04.302 --> 02:24:04.769

THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:24:06.337 --> 02:24:08.272
PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible]

02:24:08.339 --> 02:24:11.376
MEETING.

02:24:11.442 --> 02:24:13.177
CAN YOU TELL US HOW THE COST AND

02:24:13.244 --> 02:24:15.880
TIME LINES FOR SEATS CWS CARES

02:24:15.947 --> 02:24:19.350
HAVE SHIFTED.

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:21.452
YES WELL HOW COME THE THE THE

02:24:21.519 --> 02:24:23.721
TIME LINES HAVE SHIFTED IN --

02:24:23.788 --> 02:24:25.656
AND WE AS SOME FRIEND MENTIONED

02:24:25.723 --> 02:24:27.325
A MINUTE AGO WE'RE WORKING ON A

02:24:27.392 --> 02:24:29.594
NEW SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT --

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:30.928
AND IN WORKING ON THIS THE

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:32.663
BLUEPRINT THAT I REFERENCED AND

02:24:32.730 --> 02:24:35.133
THE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR

02:24:35.199 --> 02:24:37.101
DEVELOPMENT APPROACH.

02:24:37.168 --> 02:24:40.171
WE INTEND TO BUILD OUT A NEW --

02:24:40.238 --> 02:24:42.774
A PROJECTION ON SCHEDULING COST

02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:46.110
AND THE THE EXPECTATION -- IN

02:24:46.177 --> 02:24:48.746
THAT CONTEXT WOULD BE THAT IT'LL

02:24:48.813 --> 02:24:51.215
IT'LL STILL -- TAKE US SOME

02:24:51.282 --> 02:24:52.984
ADDITIONAL NUMBERS OF YEARS AND

02:24:53.051 --> 02:24:54.752
I WOULD GUESS ABOUT FOUR AT THIS

02:24:54.819 --> 02:24:56.421
POINT FOUR MORE YEARS TO FINISH

02:24:56.487 --> 02:24:57.755
THIS UP THAT'S A GAS.

02:24:57.822 --> 02:25:00.591
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S IT'S

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:02.193
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THE

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:05.329
PROJECT -- USING THIS APPROACH

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:07.265
AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT THAT

02:25:07.331 --> 02:25:10.334
OLOGY WILL -- CONTINUE ON INTO

02:25:10.401 --> 02:25:12.770
THE FUTURE AS THE SYSTEM LIVES

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:15.339
SO IT WILL -- IT'LL REQUIRE

02:25:15.406 --> 02:25:17.108
ONGOING FUNDING FOR MAINTAINING

02:25:17.175 --> 02:25:18.176
AND OPERATING IT WITH THE

02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:20.411
AMBITION THAT WE WILL CONTINUE

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:22.380
TO ENHANCE IT AND MODIFY IT AS

02:25:22.447 --> 02:25:23.414
IT DOES.

02:25:23.481 --> 02:25:25.249
SO -- WANT WHEN I TYPICALLY

02:25:25.316 --> 02:25:26.818
THINK OF A PROJECT TIMELINE I

02:25:26.884 --> 02:25:28.219
THINK OF WHEN YOU GET TO FULL

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:29.654
IMPLEMENTATION.

02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:30.922
AND THEY'LL BE A TIME THAT WE

02:25:30.988 --> 02:25:34.225
ARE ABLE TO TURN OFF THE CMS

02:25:34.292 --> 02:25:36.227
SYSTEM THE LEGACY SYSTEM.

02:25:36.294 --> 02:25:37.595
AND A TIME WHEN WHEN ALL --

02:25:37.662 --> 02:25:39.030
CHILD WELFARE WORKERS ARE

02:25:39.097 --> 02:25:40.965
UTILIZING THE NEW SYSTEM BUT

02:25:41.032 --> 02:25:41.866
THEN THEY'LL BE SUBSEQUENT

02:25:41.933 --> 02:25:42.967
PERIODS OF YOU KNOW THEY'LL

02:25:43.034 --> 02:25:44.902
THEY'LL BE ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS

02:25:44.969 --> 02:25:46.070
MADE TO THE SYSTEM AFTER THAT I

02:25:46.137 --> 02:25:47.905
THINK. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH

02:25:47.972 --> 02:25:50.942
STATE LEGACY SYSTEMS IS THAT --

02:25:51.008 --> 02:25:52.577
WE WE WORK REALLY HARD WE GET

02:25:52.643 --> 02:25:54.545
THE PROJECT DONE FOR BETTER OR

02:25:54.612 --> 02:25:57.215
WORSE WITH THE WITH A LARGE --

02:25:57.281 --> 02:25:59.917
COMPLEMENT OF UNMET NEEDS AND

02:25:59.984 --> 02:26:01.352
THEN THE SYSTEMS ARE NOT

02:26:01.419 --> 02:26:03.521
INVESTED IN ANYMORE SO THAT THE

02:26:03.588 --> 02:26:05.089
FACT THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM AS

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:06.791
KEVIN INDICATED THAT WAS

02:26:06.858 --> 02:26:07.992
DEPLOYED IN.

02:26:08.059 --> 02:26:08.526
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT VERY

02:26:08.593 --> 02:26:10.361
LITTLE IN TERMS OF MODERNIZING

02:26:10.428 --> 02:26:12.230
THE TECHNOLOGY VIRTUALLY NOTHING

02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:13.931
IS TAKING PLACE IN THAT SYSTEM

02:26:13.998 --> 02:26:14.765
ALL THE TIME.

02:26:14.832 --> 02:26:20.304
LOTS OF POLICY REQUIREMENTS OF

02:26:20.371 --> 02:26:22.106
WITHIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW

02:26:22.173 --> 02:26:22.773
REQUIREMENTS -- HAVE COME ABOUT

02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:24.108
BUT NOT ANY MODERNIZATION SO.

02:26:24.175 --> 02:26:25.877
THIS SYSTEM -- THE PART OF THE

02:26:25.943 --> 02:26:28.346
DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT UP PROP

02:26:28.412 --> 02:26:29.714
ASPECT OF THIS SYSTEM IS.

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:31.415
LET'S GET GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING

02:26:31.482 --> 02:26:33.251
ARCHITECTURE IN CREATING A

02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:35.086
SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO ENHANCE

02:26:35.153 --> 02:26:36.587
IN OVERTIME AND THEN LET'S KEEP.

02:26:36.654 --> 02:26:39.624
AN ORGANIZATION IN PLACE ONGOING

02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:41.025
THAT WILL MAINTAIN AND OPERATE

02:26:41.092 --> 02:26:43.060
THAT SYSTEM FOR YEARS TO COME SO

02:26:43.127 --> 02:26:45.062
THEY'LL NEVER AGAIN GET OUTDATED --

02:26:45.129 --> 02:26:46.430
AND THE WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO

02:26:46.497 --> 02:26:47.832
GIVE GIVE UP.

02:26:47.899 --> 02:26:49.200
BUT THAT.

02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:49.767
THAT'S A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT

02:26:49.834 --> 02:26:51.035
MINDSET AND DIFFERENT SKILL SET

02:26:51.102 --> 02:26:52.870
I THINK THEM WHAT WE ORIGINALLY

02:26:52.937 --> 02:26:53.971
UNDERSTOOD FULL ANDTHAT'S WHY

02:26:54.038 --> 02:26:55.673
WE'RE SPENDING THIS ADDITIONAL

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:58.042
TIME INVESTING IN THAT -- THE S.

02:26:58.109 --> 02:27:00.278
P. R. THAT WE FINISH UP -- AND

02:27:00.344 --> 02:27:02.713
AND DELIVER THIS MID SUMMER WILL

02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:05.016
ALSO BE -- ACCOMPANIED BY A

02:27:05.082 --> 02:27:06.717
FEDERAL APPROVAL.

02:27:06.784 --> 02:27:08.653
PLANNING DOCUMENT AS WELL AND WE

02:27:08.719 --> 02:27:10.688
WILL PROJECT THAT THE COST TO

02:27:10.755 --> 02:27:13.257
GET TO THE POINT OF COMPLETING

02:27:13.324 --> 02:27:15.092
FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE CMS

02:27:15.159 --> 02:27:17.261
SYSTEM -- AND IT'LL BE A

02:27:17.328 --> 02:27:18.696
PLACEHOLDER AMOUNTS FOR

02:27:18.763 --> 02:27:20.264
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT BUT BUT WE'LL

02:27:20.331 --> 02:27:21.933
TRY TO GIVE SOME RELATIVE ORDER

02:27:21.999 --> 02:27:24.302
OF MAGNITUDE OF TIME AND MONEY

02:27:24.368 --> 02:27:26.470
AND THAT S. P. R..

02:27:26.537 --> 02:27:27.271
WONDERFUL IT ARE ARE YOU WHAT

THE THREE GOVERNANCE -- POINTS

02:28:48.953 --> 02:28:50.988
OF THE PROJECT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:28:51.055 --> 02:28:51.722
THAT ALL OF THOSE VOICES ARE

02:28:51.789 --> 02:28:52.356
HEARD.

02:28:52.423 --> 02:28:54.191
OUR INITIAL FEEDBACK FROM

02:28:54.258 --> 02:28:56.160
COUNTIES -- HAS BEEN --

02:28:56.227 --> 02:28:57.895
APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROCESS OF

02:28:57.962 --> 02:28:58.829
INCLUDING THEM THEY'VE BEEN VERY

02:28:58.896 --> 02:29:00.931
APPRECIATIVE OF THE OF THE FOCUS

02:29:00.998 --> 02:29:03.167
OF USING USER RESEARCH USER

02:29:03.234 --> 02:29:04.835
CENTERED DESIGN -- THAT'S AN

02:29:04.902 --> 02:29:07.705
IMPORTANT -- ASPECT OF CREATING

02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:10.141
ON THE NEW SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU

02:29:10.207 --> 02:29:12.510
NEED TO TO REALLY ACTUALLY SEE

02:29:12.576 --> 02:29:13.844
WHAT THEY DO AND ACTUALLY

02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:16.380
PARTICIPATE IN A IN A VISIONING

02:29:16.447 --> 02:29:18.316
PUT IT THAT WAY SESSION OF HOW

02:29:18.382 --> 02:29:20.818
TO GET THINGS DONE -- BETTER SO

02:29:20.885 --> 02:29:21.886
FOR EXAMPLE AGAIN JUST GIVE YOU

02:29:21.952 --> 02:29:27.258
A QUICK EXAMPLE NOT TAKE UP TOO

02:29:27.325 --> 02:29:28.726
MUCH MORE OF YOUR TIME BUT ONE

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:29.860
WHEN WE SAT DOWN WITH PEOPLE WHO

02:29:29.927 --> 02:29:30.528
WERE IN THE PROGRAM AREA ON THE

02:29:30.594 --> 02:29:31.562
SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE AND THE

02:29:31.629 --> 02:29:32.129
COUNTY USERS.

02:29:32.196 --> 02:29:33.331
AND WE SAID HOW DO WE IMPROVE

02:29:33.397 --> 02:29:35.366
THIS PROCESS AND RESOURCE FAMILY

02:29:35.433 --> 02:29:37.201
APPLICATION IS AN EGG IS THE

02:29:37.268 --> 02:29:38.836
EXAMPLE I'M THINKING OF

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:41.238
EVERYBODY WAS SAYING IT TAKES

02:29:41.305 --> 02:29:42.206
TWO HUNDRED AND TEN DAYS NOW ON

02:29:42.273 --> 02:29:43.774
AVERAGE FOR AN APPLICATION TO GO

02:29:43.841 --> 02:29:44.508
THROUGH.

02:29:44.575 --> 02:29:46.510
IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING CLOSER TO

02:29:46.577 --> 02:29:49.080
WHAT IS IT. ONE ONE SIXTY OR

02:29:49.146 --> 02:29:50.414
NINETY NINETY SORRY HOW NEW IS A

02:29:50.481 --> 02:29:52.650
LOT SHORTER IT SHOULD BE CLOSER

02:29:52.717 --> 02:29:55.019
TO NINETY AND SO -- THE PROCESS

02:29:55.086 --> 02:29:56.754
WE GO THROUGH IS TO SAY OKAY

02:29:56.821 --> 02:29:58.456
LET'S MAP OUT HOW IT IS AND THEN

02:29:58.522 --> 02:29:59.957
WE LOOK TOGETHER AND THE

02:30:00.024 --> 02:30:01.258
COUNTIES BECOME IMPORTANT

02:30:01.325 --> 02:30:03.160
FEEDBACK LOOP HERE. TO SAY COULD

02:30:03.227 --> 02:30:05.930
WE DO ATTRACT THIS PROCESS COULD

02:30:05.996 --> 02:30:08.866
WE LEAPFROG OVER THIS THIS --

02:30:08.933 --> 02:30:10.368
DEPENDENCY HERE AND PICK IT UP

02:30:10.434 --> 02:30:11.302
LATER SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:30:11.369 --> 02:30:13.070
BUSINESS PROCESS REVIEW AN

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:14.839
ADDITION TO JUST HOW THE SYSTEM

02:30:14.905 --> 02:30:16.340
WILL ACTUALLY FUNCTION.

02:30:16.407 --> 02:30:17.675
AND WE CAN'T DO THAT BUSINESS

02:30:17.742 --> 02:30:19.577
PROCESS REVIEW WITHOUT COUNTY

02:30:19.643 --> 02:30:20.578
ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE WOULD

02:30:20.644 --> 02:30:22.813
PROBABLY MESS UP -- WE WOULD

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.782
MAKE A AN ASSUMPTION THAT THEY

02:30:24.849 --> 02:30:26.117
DON'T NEED TO MEET WITH CLIENTS

02:30:26.183 --> 02:30:26.851
SECOND YOU KNOWING SAVE TIME

02:30:26.917 --> 02:30:28.252
DON'T MEET WITH THE CLIENTS --

02:30:28.319 --> 02:30:30.621
THAT WOULD BE WRONG ALRIGHT SO --

02:30:30.688 --> 02:30:32.156
COUNTY PARTICIPATION IN THAT AS

02:30:32.223 --> 02:30:36.026
WELL AS SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAM

02:30:36.093 --> 02:30:36.794
PARTICIPATION IS IMPORTANT.

02:30:36.861 --> 02:30:38.562
THAT ACTIVE PARTICIPATION.

02:30:38.629 --> 02:30:41.165
IS TAKES A LOT MORE TIME THAN

02:30:41.232 --> 02:30:42.933
PEOPLE GOING INTO A ROOM AND

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:44.735
WRITING REQUIREMENTS FOR SYSTEM

02:30:44.802 --> 02:30:46.837
AND THROWING IT OVER THE WALL --

02:30:46.904 --> 02:30:48.773
IT JUSTDOES AND BUT IT IT'LL

02:30:48.839 --> 02:30:50.374
END UP WITH A BETTER RESULT.

02:30:50.441 --> 02:30:52.476
AND THE THE GETTING USED TO

02:30:52.543 --> 02:30:53.677
LISTENING TO EACH OTHER AND

02:30:53.744 --> 02:30:55.246
CARING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S A BIG

02:30:55.312 --> 02:30:58.215
PART OF OF WHAT ULTIMATELY THIS

02:30:58.282 --> 02:31:00.084
PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO DO.

02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:00.918
ANDI THINK THE END RESULT IS

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.720
GOING TO BE SO MUCH BETTER I

02:31:02.787 --> 02:31:09.059
THINK SO -- WONDERFUL -- YES

02:31:09.126 --> 02:31:13.097
MOST FRAZIER.

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:16.600
I SINCE THE YOUR FRUSTRATION ON

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:19.403
FROM NINETY TWO TO NINETY AND

02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:20.571
THEN NINETY EIGHT NOW I'VE.

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:23.407
I GET IT -- I THINK THAT WOULD

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:24.775
BE APPROPRIATE AND WE LOOK AT

02:31:24.842 --> 02:31:26.911
FUTURE GOALS TO GO FOR THAT WE

02:31:26.977 --> 02:31:28.045
HAVE AN INDEXING.

02:31:28.112 --> 02:31:30.114
ON A BUDGET INCREASE EVERY YEAR

02:31:30.181 --> 02:31:31.182
TO BE ABLE.

02:31:31.248 --> 02:31:32.683
TO ACCOMMODATE OPERATIONS AND

02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:35.719
MAINTENANCE OF PUTTING FORTH I

02:31:35.786 --> 02:31:36.320
THINK IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE A

02:31:36.387 --> 02:31:38.756
MONEY SAVER -- RATHER THAN

02:31:38.823 --> 02:31:40.991
REVAMPING THE WHOLE PROGRAM OR

02:31:41.058 --> 02:31:42.259
SIT SITUATION REPORT.

02:31:42.326 --> 02:31:44.662
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:31:44.728 --> 02:31:46.363
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO BE.

02:31:46.430 --> 02:31:47.798
MAYBE -- OF COLLABORATION WITH

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:49.433
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AND

02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:51.669
AND LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO

02:31:51.735 --> 02:31:53.971
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT WOULD BE.

02:31:54.038 --> 02:31:55.506
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:31:55.573 --> 02:31:56.941
THAT PROCESS IS AN ONGOING

02:31:57.007 --> 02:31:58.909
UPGRADE YES GOING FORWARD I

02:31:58.976 --> 02:32:00.744
THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:01.679
BUSINESS THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOES

02:32:01.745 --> 02:32:03.881
IT -- I DON'T SEE WHY WE SHOULD

02:32:03.948 --> 02:32:04.348
BE.

02:32:04.415 --> 02:32:06.550
DOING THE SAME THING I APOLOGIZE

02:32:06.617 --> 02:32:08.552
FOR TWENTY YEARS OF OF OF

02:32:08.619 --> 02:32:10.354
WAITING.

02:32:10.421 --> 02:32:12.456
AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE

02:32:12.523 --> 02:32:14.825
AGENCIES WILLINGNESS.

02:32:14.892 --> 02:32:18.195
TO ADVANCE TO SERVICE THE PEOPLE

02:32:18.262 --> 02:32:19.463
THAT WE REPRESENT.

02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:21.932
HI I SEE THAT ONGOING MESSAGE

02:32:21.999 --> 02:32:23.567
GOING FORWARD HOW WE CAN BETTER

02:32:23.634 --> 02:32:24.802
SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT WE

02:32:24.869 --> 02:32:27.037
REPRESENT NIGHT I CAN'T THANK

02:32:27.104 --> 02:32:29.006
YOU ENOUGH FOR THAT IT'S NO.

02:32:29.073 --> 02:32:31.475
USE FACE OF GOVERNMENT WELL AS

02:32:31.542 --> 02:32:33.043
ACTUALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:34.712
THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT --

02:32:34.778 --> 02:32:36.280
NEED YOUR HELP AND THE BETTER

02:32:36.347 --> 02:32:38.148
THAT WE CAN SERVE YOU CONSERVE

02:32:38.215 --> 02:32:40.651
THEM ACTUALLY HELPS US ALSO IN

02:32:40.718 --> 02:32:43.554
OUR OR WAY OF REPRESENTING SO --

02:32:43.621 --> 02:32:44.088
LOOKING FOR DOOR FOR THE

02:32:44.154 --> 02:32:46.924
DEPARTMENT TO AND HOW WE CAN
