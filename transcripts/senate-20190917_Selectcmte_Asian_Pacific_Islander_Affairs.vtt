AMERICANS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY

AMERICA. WE DO A LOT OF HEAVY

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:54.607

PART OF. AND WE'RE DOING BETTER

IS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS.

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.892
OKAY IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:13.392
GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN HAS

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.827

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:15.427
SEVENTY ASIAN AMERICAN JUDGES

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:16.729
AND THE LAST SEVEN YEARS IN

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.797
LARGE PART BECAUSE OF EFFORTS

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.933
LIKE THIS GETTING THE WORD OUT

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.768
GETTING PEOPLE TO APPLY GETTING

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:24.770
US MOVING FORWARD NO ASIAN

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:28.474
AMERICANS OR 16% THE POPULATION

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.543

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:34.680
COURT JUDICIARY A HUGE STEP

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:38.717
FORWARD AND I JUST WANT TO SAY

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:40.986
I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE OF

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.955
THIS WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR WITH

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:46.625
GOVERNOR. SOME A GOOD TRACK.

00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:47.092
WERE BROWN. EXCELLENT

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:50.796
APPOINTMENTS LIKE ME. I HAVE TO

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.698
SAY IT'S BEEN AN EXCITING TIME

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:54.700
FOR US BUT AS SENATOR PAN SAID

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.835
THERE IS A STUDY THAT WAS PUT

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:58.771
TOGETHER BY JUSTUS GOODWIN LIU

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:00.873
WITH HELP FROM THE PABA AND THE

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.577
YALE LAW SCHOOL AND THAT STUDY

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:06.745
GIVES US A NUMBER OF A NUMBER

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.747
OF NUMBERS ACTUALLY ABOUT THE

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:10.816
STATE OF ASIAN AMERICANS AND

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:12.751
THE LAW AND IT REALLY COMES TO

00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:14.820
THE CONCLUSION THAT WE STILL

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:16.789
HAVE A LONG LONG WAY TO GO. SO

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:18.891
IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THE

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.960
NUMBER OF ASIAN AMERICANS GOING

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.795
TO LAW SCHOOL INSTEAD OF

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:26.665
MEDICAL SCHOOL HAS INCREASED IT

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:28.701
HAS ACTUALLY QUADRUPLED SO WE

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:32.771
HAVE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:36.709
ASIAN AMERICANS BEING INTO THE

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:40.746
FASHION. BUT THAT SOME IS NOT.

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.881
EITHER IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:44.750
IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE ARENA. SO

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:45.317
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHAT

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:48.687
WE'RE SEEING IS LARGE LAW FIRMS

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.889
BIG TOP TEN LAW FIRMS THERE

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.691
CERTAINLY HIRING A MAID AT

00:14:52.758 --> 00:14:54.760
ASIAN AMERICAN LAWYERS FACT. IF

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.829
YOU LOOK AT A LAW FIRM AND YOU

00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:58.831
COUNT UP ALL THE ASIAN AND ALL

00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:00.899
THE ALL THE MINORITY ASSOCIATES

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:02.968
AND PARTNERS. ASIAN AMERICANS

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:05.070
ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE LARGEST

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:07.072
MINORITY GROUP IN PRIVATE LAW

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:09.074
FIRMS. BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:10.876
ASSOCIATES THAT HAVE THE

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:12.945
HIGHEST ATTRITION RATES AND THE

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:14.947
LOWEST RATIO OF PARTNERS TO

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.915
ASSOCIATES. SO TRANSLATION

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:19.118
THEY'RE LEAVING IN DROVES AND

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:21.053
THEY'RE NOT MOVING UP. AND WE

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.923
SEE THAT SAME TREND ECHOED IN

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:29.028
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SERVICE SO

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:33.098
ONE OF THE M. IN. THAT CAME OUT

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:33.666
OF THIS STUDY WAS THAT MOST

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:34.300
ASIAN AMERICANS DON'T GO INTO

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.301
THE LEGAL PROFESSION THINKING

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:35.901
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:37.036
GOVERNMENT OR THINKING IF

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:37.670
THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO PUBLIC

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:39.305
SERVICE. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:41.273
CHICKEN AND EGG ISSUES RIGHT

IN THOSE POSITIONS YOU CAN'T

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.112

THAT OUT OF THE TWO THOUSAND

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:21.113

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.227
THE FEDERAL SIDE SO WE HAVE

THE FACT THAT THE MOTHER IN

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:11.262
CONTENT START. STARTS IN THE

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.929
MINDS OF THESE WRITERS WHO THEN

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:15.266

ENOUGH. WRITERS ALSO NEEDED TO

00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:37.188
LEARN THE BUSINESS OF HOLLYWOOD.

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:45.162

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:03.347
NOT THE BEST TRACK RECORDS IN

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.298
SOMETIMES IT'S RARE TO HAVE

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:14.204
THIS PART. AND MY CHILDREN THEN

00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.173
SAID HE COULDN'T SEE THAT TOO

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.308
BUT TO HIS CREDIT HE SAID TO GO

00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:20.277
AHEAD IF I COULD FIND THE RIGHT

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:22.212
ACTOR FOR THE ROLE HE WOULD

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:24.281
SUPPORT IT. SO I SENT THE

00:46:24.348 --> 00:46:24.815
CHARACTER DESCRIPTION FOR

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:26.250

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:29.019
QUESTIONS THEY ASKED WAS CAN

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:30.387
YOU FEEL IT TINO OR AFRICAN

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:34.158
AMERICAN. AND WHEN I SAID NO

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:36.527
THE SENT US A HANDFUL OF HIS

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:37.094
LEAST ROUNDED UP ACTORS WHO

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:38.529
WERE NOWHERE CLOSE TO HITTING

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:40.197
THE MARK. THEY EXPLAINED THAT

00:46:40.264 --> 00:46:40.697
THE KIND OF GOOD LOOKING

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.432
CHARMING TALENTED SEXUALLY

LOOKING FOR DID NOT EXIST. CAN

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:50.841
BE FOUND. THANKFULLY I WAS CO

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:52.109
WRITING THE SCRIPT WITH ANOTHER

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:52.743
ASIAN AMERICAN WRITER WHO TOOK

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.178
THIS VERY PERSONALLY AND

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:56.313
TOGETHER. WE PUSHED ON CASTING

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.215
AND REFUSED TO CONCEDE UNTIL

00:46:58.282 --> 00:47:00.117
THEY FOUND IS THE RIGHT ACTOR.

00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:02.219
DIG DEEPER. AND EVENTUALLY THEY

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:04.121
DID THE ACTOR WAS AMAZING

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:06.390
WONDERFUL THE EPISODE TURNED

00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:08.125
OUT WELL AND HE BROUGHT SO MUCH

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:08.759
TO THE ROLE AND HE IS YOU KNOW

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:12.129
IT'S CONTINUED TO ACT AND STAR

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:12.596
IN. A BE FEATURED IN A

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:16.099
TELEVISION SERIES. THIS WAS

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:16.700
SIXTEEN YEARS AGO. AND SINCE

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:18.335
THEN I'VE WORKED ON A VARIETY

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:20.404
OF SHOWS BUT OFTEN I RUN INTO

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.971
THE SAME SITUATION AGAIN AND

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:24.208
AGAIN. ON ONE OF THE LAST SHOWS

00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:26.109
I WAS ON WE HAD A VILLAIN

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:26.710
CHARACTER WHO WAS PHYSICALLY

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.111
AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:30.180
INTIMIDATING. AND I WANTED TO

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:30.781
LOOK AT USING ACTORS FOR THE

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:32.549
PART AND THAT SHOW RUNNER SAID

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:36.119
YOU COULDN'T SEE IT. AND THIS

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:36.720
TIME HE DID NOT TO GIVE ME THE

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:38.188
GO AHEAD TO PURSUE THAT. SO

00:47:38.255 --> 00:47:40.591
WHAT I WILL. THAT IF I WANT TO

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.426
CAST AN ASIAN ACTOR IN A PART.

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:44.261
THAT ISN'T GENERIC MUGGING

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:46.363
VICTIM NUMBER TWO OR STEER

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.432
TYPICALLY ASIAN NAIL SALON

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:50.267

FOR WOMEN. OR COMPUTER TECH

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:54.137
ENGINEER TRIAD MEMBER FOR MEN.

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.273
I WOULD GET VARYING DEGREES OF

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.508
PUSH BACK WHETHER IT'S FROM THE

00:47:58.575 --> 00:47:59.109
SHOW RUNNERS CASTING A STUDIO

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:00.444
EXECUTIVES. NO ONE WOULD EVER

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.546
OPENLY SAY WE DON'T WANT TO

00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:04.281
CAST ASIANS THAT WOULD JUST BE

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:06.183
A SILENCE OR I'D GET A LIST OF

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:06.750
POTENTIAL ACTORS WERE NOT

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:08.652
ASIAN. OR THEY SAY THEY WERE

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.520
ALL FOR PROMOTING DIVERSITY BUT

00:48:10.587 --> 00:48:11.088
THE TALENT POOL SIMPLY ISN'T

00:48:11.154 --> 00:48:14.625
THERE. THESE ARE BATTLES I. IN

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.460
OTHER API CREATORS ARE USED TO

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:18.495
FIGHTING. BUT EVEN WHEN WE DO

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.330
SUCCEED THAT VICTORY FEELS FAN.

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:22.399
THE PARTS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:24.301
ARE FOR SMALLER ROLES. OF THE

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:24.968
DOZEN TV SHOWS I'VE WORKED ON

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:26.737
ALL THE LEAD ROLES WHAT WE CALL

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.605
NUMBER ONE ON THE CALL SHEET

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:30.574
OUR WHITE. AND FOR THAT MATTER

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:31.174
NUMBER TWO THREE AND SOMETIMES

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:36.346
FOUR WHITE. NUMBER FIVE

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:36.980
SOMETIMES AND THAT'S WHERE YOU

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.382
SORT OF BERRY LIKE YOU KNOW

00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:39.016
DETECTIVE NUMBER FOUR AND YOU

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:40.450
KNOW THAT'S WHERE YOU GET YOUR

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:41.051
PERSON OF COLOR ON ON THAT TV

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:44.655
SHOW. I'M THAT'S NOT TO SAY

00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:46.423
THERE HASN'T BEEN. THERE HAVE

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.225
BEEN MANY BREAK OUT MEANINGFUL

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:50.360
ROLES FOR API ACTORS. CENTER

JIM MAIL AND- MANY JUSTIN SO IN

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:58.568
A GOOD PLACE AND JUST TO NAME A

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.637
FEW. BUT WE SHOULD NOT TAKE

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:02.272
THIS PROGRESS FOR GRANTED.

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:04.374
STUDIOS STILL CLAIM THAT YOU'RE

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:04.875
PROMOTING DIVERSITY M.

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:06.576
VISIBILITY BY CASTING ASIANS IN

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:08.645
WHAT. YOU WOULD VIEW AS MINOR

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:09.246
AND SOMETIMES INTERCHANGEABLE

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:12.649
ROLES. AND THE TRUTH IS THOSE

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:16.320
TOKEN EFFORTS TO PROMOTE. IT TO

00:49:16.386 --> 00:49:16.887
PROMOTE DIVERSITY YOU KNOW

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:18.555
ACTUALLY PROMOTES ANOTHER

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:20.424
DAMAGING NARRATIVE SWITCHES

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.559
ASIANS CAN BE BIT PLAYERS BUT

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:23.160
THEY ARE NOT THE HEROES OF THE

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:24.561
STORY. AND THIS BEGS THE

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:26.596
QUESTION WHY ISN'T THERE MORE

00:49:26.663 --> 00:49:28.432
CONTENT FEATURING ASIAN LEADS

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:30.567
AND STORIES. FIRST ALTHOUGH AS

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.369
MITCHELL POINTED OUT THE

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:34.237
NUMBERS ARE IMPROVING THERE'S A

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:36.239
LACK OF API CONTENT CREATORS.

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:36.840
AND EVEN FOR THOSE OF US WHO

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:38.475
BECOME SUCCESSFUL SHOW RUNNERS

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:40.477
WRITERS DIRECTORS. DIRECTORS WE

00:49:40.544 --> 00:49:42.479
FACE A GAUNTLET OF OBSTACLES

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:44.314
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO GET OR

00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:46.249
SELL SHOWS WITH LEADS WHO LOOK

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:48.418
LIKE US. I KNOW AND HAVE

00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:48.952
COMMISERATE WITH SEVERAL

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:50.554
EXPERIENCE WELL REGARDED API

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.656
WRITERS WHO SUCCESSFULLY

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:54.524
SUCCESSFULLY RUN SHOWS WITH

00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:56.493
WHITE LEADS BUT CAN'T LAUNCH

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.395
SHOWS WITH ASIAN LEADS. AND THE

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:00.464
CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE THAT

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.399
AMONG THE DEVELOPMENT

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:02.966
EXECUTIVES AND PRODUCERS WHO

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.468
ARE OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE THEY

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:06.603
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE STORIES

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:07.104
UNDERSTAND THE CULTURAL

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.538
SPECIFICITY AND BECAUSE THEY

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:12.676
CAN'T RELATE TO OUR STORIES. AS

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:14.444
A RESULT WE DON'T CHAMPION THEM.

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:16.513
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS OF COURSE

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.080
THIS PAST YEAR WE'VE HAD A

00:50:17.147 --> 00:50:18.815
WEALTH OF ASIAN DRIVEN MOVIE

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.817
HITS. SUCH AS TO ALL THE BOYS

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.552
OF LOVE BEFORE SEARCHING ALWAYS

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:24.688
BE MY MAYBE AND OF COURSE CRAZY

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:26.523
RICH ASIANS. WHICH TOGETHER

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:28.358
COLLECTIVELY PROVED MAINSTREAM

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:30.427
AMERICA IS READY AND

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:31.027
ENTHUSIASTIC TO C. API DRIVEN

00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:32.763
CONTENT. THE STUDIO SYSTEM IS

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:34.765
SLOW TO ADAPT. AFTER THE BOX

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:36.733
OFFICE SUCCESS A CRAZY RICH

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.468
ASIANS THERE WAS TALK OF THIS

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:40.370
NEW ERA IN HOLLYWOOD AND THAT

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:41.004
THERE WAS A RECORD NUMBER OF

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:41.571
ASIAN DRIVEN PROJECTS BEING

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:46.443
PICKED UP. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:47.110
SAY THAT THAT WAS A YEAR AGO OF

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:48.645
THE NUMBER OF SHOWS THAT WERE

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:50.881
AT LEAST DEVELOPED. AS MITCHELL

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:54.684
POINTED OUT ONE WAS PICKED OUT

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:56.386
FOR NETWORK BROADCAST PRIMETIME.

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:58.588
THE BIGGER ISSUE. IS NOT JUST

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:00.524
GIVING OPPORTUNITIES TO ASIAN

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.191
ACTORS I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:04.361
ROOM KNOWS THAT. MOVIES AND TV

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:06.463
ARE A MIRROR TO AMERICA. I WAS

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.997
AN IMMIGRANT I GREW UP IN

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:08.365
MALAYSIA I CAME HERE WHEN I WAS

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:10.367
NINETEEN AND EVERYTHING I KNEW

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:11.001
ABOUT AMERICA WAS FROM MOVIES

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:12.769
IT'S WHY I WANTED TO COME TO

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:13.303
THIS COUNTRY TO BE PART OF

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.504
SOMETHING AMAZING. HAVING

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:16.873
WORKED IN IT I KNOW NOW IT IS A

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.742
DISTORTED MIRROR. ONE THAT HAS

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:20.544
SELECTIVELY IGNORE THE FACES

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:21.144
STORIES AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:24.648
OF OUR COMMUNITY. I DON'T KNOW

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:26.550
WHAT THE SOLUTION IS BUT I DO

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:27.083
KNOW THAT IT STARTS WITH

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.585
SHINING A SPOTLIGHT ON THE DEEP

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:29.119
SYSTEMIC ISSUES FACING OUR

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:32.389
CREATIVE COMMUNITY TODAY.

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:32.956
CALLING OUT BY IS UNFAIR

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:36.460
BLATANTLY RACIST PRACTICES WHEN

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:37.060
WE SEE THEM. INSTEAD OF GOING

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:38.562
ALONG TO GET ALONG. AND PUTTING

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.363
PRESSURE ON THE STUDIOS TO MAKE

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.931
MEANINGFUL CHANGES. IN THE

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:42.599
PRACTICE IS TO PROMOTE

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:44.367
DIVERSITY AND NOT JUST PAYING

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:46.369
IT LIP SERVICE. IF THEY CLAIM

00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:48.472
THEY CAN'T C. S. LET'S MAKE

00:51:48.538 --> 00:51:49.072
SURE THE AT LEAST CAN HEAR US.

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:58.682
THANK YOU. QUESTIONS SERVER

00:51:58.748 --> 00:52:02.919
CHOW JIM I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP

00:52:02.986 --> 00:52:06.623
ON YOUR LAST COMMENT. AND THEN.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.859
YEAH BY PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:12.596
STUDIOS. YOU KNOW WHAT

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.564
SPECIFICALLY CAN WE DO I MEAN

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.600
AT YOU KNOW HE IS REFERRING TO

00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:19.069
LET'S SAY AS A **** AS WE COULD

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.871
PROBABLY OF VOICE ALL CONCERNED

00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:22.906
PROBABLY UP IS THAT SOMETHING

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:26.576
THAT YOU KNOW THAT WE COULD CUT.

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:28.712
IT CANNOT DO AS AS AS A AS A AS

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:30.747
A BODY. ABSOLUTELY I. THERE WAS

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.616
MUCH OF THE TAX CREDIT STUDIOS

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:34.684
ABSOLUTELY RESPOND TO THE

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:36.853
PRESSURE FROM THE PUBLIC AND

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.354
PRESSURE FROM LAWMAKERS

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.755
PARTICULARLY WHEN THEIR TAX

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:40.857
INCENTIVES DANGLED IN FRONT OF

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:42.559
THEM AND I THINK ONE OF THE

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:43.193
THINGS THAT CAN BE IT PUT TO

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.928
THEM IS JUST TO IMPROVE THE

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:46.663
EXISTING NUMBERS. AND THAT

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.632
REALLY DOES COME FROM HIRING

00:52:48.698 --> 00:52:50.834
API CONTENT CREATORS NOT JUST

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:52.769
SUPERFICIALLY BOOSTING THEIR

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.671
NUMBERS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.640
LOWER LEVEL WRITERS ON TV SHOWS

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:57.207
THAT ARE BEING HIRED BECAUSE

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:58.942
WHEN YOU HIRE A WHEN YOU HIRE

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:02.479
AN API CONTENT CREATOR DIRECTOR

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:04.681
FOR FILM OR A SHOW RUNNER FOR

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:06.683
TELEVISION. THERE ARE CHANGES

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.485
UP AND DOWN THE RANKS WHETHER

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.687
IT'S IN CASTING AND CREW BEHIND

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:12.622
THE SCENES ALL OF THOSE NUMBERS

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.558
CHANGE AT AS A REACTION TO

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:16.626
THAT. NOW YOU MENTIONED I THINK

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:18.495
I THINK WAS MACHEL MENTION

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:19.062
ABOUT THE TAX CREDIT ANDY

00:53:19.129 --> 00:53:20.697
INCLUSION WRITERS SO

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:22.799
SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW AT THE

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:24.501
STATE LEVEL AT THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:26.703
LEVEL CAN YOU THINK OF ANY ANY

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.905
OTHER MEASURES THAT. WE COULD

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:34.578
TAKE ON IT AS AS A WHOLE. I

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:35.111
THINK IF WE CAN CONTINUE

00:53:35.178 --> 00:53:36.646
PUSHING ON THOSE LEVERS THAT WE

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.648
HAVE AND- AND ALSO IF THERE'S

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:39.215
MORE EVEN JUST. SHINING THE

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:40.884
SPOTLIGHT SAYING WHAT ARE SOME

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.953
OF WHICH ARE YOUR NUMBERS OF

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:44.821
EXECUTIVES I DON'T THINK I HAVE

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:46.489
BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY STUDY.

00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:48.491
AND MAYBE SOMEONE ON TODAY'S

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:49.125
PANEL WILL HOPEFULLY WE'LL DO A

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:52.495
STUDY AFTER TODAY WHAT DOES.

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:54.598
HOLLY WOULD SPECIFICALLY WHAT

00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:58.602
IS THERE EXECUTIVE RANKS LOOK

00:53:58.668 --> 00:53:59.169
LIKE IN TERMS OF THEIR- API

00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:06.576
MAKE UP. SCOTT AND. SO MY CAR

SOME OF US MIKE **** HAD A

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:14.951
CHANCE TO MEET WITH YOU THE LOS

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:16.920
ANGELES WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:18.822
THE INDUSTRY I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

00:54:18.888 --> 00:54:19.456
A SHOW RUNNER WAS THE TIMES I'M

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:23.059
GLAD YOU ACTUALLY. THERE'S MORE

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:23.627
BUREAUCRACY IN HOLLYWOOD AND

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:26.730
POLITICS. THE GOVERNMENT. BUT

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:28.598
BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH

00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:29.232
AND YOU MENTIONED A TAX CREDIT

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:31.101
AND- THAT. CREDIT THE CREDIT

00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:32.936
FOR GETTING THE TAX CREDIT AND

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:34.671
THAT CONVERSATION TO REALLY.

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:36.606
DOESN'T BELONG LEGISLATURE IT

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:37.240
BELONGS THE TWO OF YOU AND THE

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:38.842
OTHERS THAT REALLY CONTINUE TO

00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:39.442
SPEAK UP AND HAVE BEEN FOR A

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.044
VERY LONG TIME. A VERY LONG

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:46.650
TIME. AND LET ME TALK ABOUT TO.

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:49.052
THAT ONE OF THE QUOTES THAT I

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.620
W. SAYS WE'RE ALL FOR DIVERSITY

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:51.187
BUT THE TOPPLE SIMPLY ISN'T

00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:52.689
THERE. WE HEAR THAT A LOT. M.

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:54.758
AND WE HEAR THAT ACROSS THE

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:55.258
BOARD I THINK A LOT OF

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:56.726
DIFFERENT YOU KNOW WOMEN HERE

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:59.029
THAT. ALL THE TIME. BUT IF I

00:54:59.095 --> 00:55:00.730
GET ESPECIALLY DODD BUT TRACK.

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:03.133
I GOT A LOT OF CONVERSATION TED

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:03.767
WHEN IT COMES AFTER MIKE LEFT

00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:05.035
IN THIS THAT. TOPPLED AS THEIR

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:06.803
AND HOLLY WOULD CERTAINLY I

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.872
THINK A NUMBER. OF MINORITY

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:10.874
GROUPS AS WELL AS WOMEN HERE

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.809
THAT OFTEN TIMES. AND IT'S

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:13.376
UNACCEPTABLE IT'S A TOTALLY

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:18.982
UNACCEPTABLE AND. SO WHAT I

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:19.549
SAY. IS THEN YOU CREATE THE

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:21.051
TALENT POOL. AS THE PEOPLE ARE

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:22.886
THERE THE TALENTS THERE. AND SO

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:23.453
PART OF IT IS CERTAINLY AN

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.788
IMPLICIT BIAS WHICH IS

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:25.321
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN.

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.723
DEALING WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:27.323
THIS YEAR ALONE ONE OF ONE OF

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:28.992
OUR COLLEAGUES WHILE THEY- HAD

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:30.960
THREE DIFFERENT TWO DIFFERENT

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:32.729
BILLS. THAT HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:33.363
BUT THE COURT SYSTEM CANNELLA

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.065
JUST SYSTEM OF THE HEALTHCARE

00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:36.800
SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF TRAINING ON

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:37.434
IMPLICIT BIAS THAT MIGHT BE A

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.069
DIRECTION. WE CAN TALK ABOUT

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:40.737
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AS

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.772
WELL. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:44.841
MATTER. OF THE NUMBERS. IT'S

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:45.375
ALSO A MATTER OF HOW WE'RE

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:49.012
PORTRAYED. AND MIKE YOU COME

00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:51.147
HERE AND THE TV AND MOVIES AND-

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:53.049
WHEN YOU SEE HIGHER PERPETRATED

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:54.718
END UP BEING BULLIED BECAUSE-

00:55:54.784 --> 00:55:56.820
HOW. IN MY CASE INDIANS OF A

00:55:56.886 --> 00:55:58.988
TRADE ON TV. AND IT'S JUST. YOU

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:00.990
KNOW TO THINK ABOUT. HOW FAR

00:56:01.057 --> 00:56:03.126
WE'VE COME AND HELP OUT WE

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:05.028
HAVEN'T COME. AND SO YOU KNOW

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:06.796
WHEN IT COMES TO PORTRAYAL SO

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.732
THE ONE THING IS THE NUMBERS

00:56:08.798 --> 00:56:09.365
AND THE OTHER THING IS OUR PRE

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:11.134
TRADE. HOW CAN WE MOVE ON ON

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:14.738
THAT ISSUE OF POWER FOR TRADE.

00:56:14.804 --> 00:56:16.973
NOT SIMPLY JUST HOW MAY WHAT

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.979
THE NUMBERS. ARE WHICH IS

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:23.613
SOMETHING WE ALL AGREE NEEDS TO

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.016
IMPROVE AS WELL. I'M IN TERMS

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:28.752
OF HOW WE ARE PORTRAYED IT.

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:29.385
DOES REALLY GO BACK TO HAVING A

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:30.887
PI. CONTENT CREATE. BECAUSE

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:31.454
THERE IS. WHAT WE DO IS SO

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:33.123
SUBJECTIVE. AND THERE IS A PREP

00:56:33.189 --> 00:56:34.924
THE PROBLEM IDEA THAT WHITE

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:36.726
MALE SHOW RUNNERS WHITE MALE

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:37.327
FEATURE WRITERS CAN WRITE FOR

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:40.797
ANYBODY. WHERE AS WE ARE

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:42.832
RELEGATED TO ONLY WRITE NEEDS

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:43.433
ONLY WRITING FOR YOU KNOW OUR

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.137
COMMUNITY. AND I DON'T HAVE TO

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:48.738
TELL THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:49.372
BUT YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO HAVE

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.107
WALKED IN THOSE SHOES TO BE

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:52.842
ABLE TO WRITE FROM THAT

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:54.911
CHARACTER FOR THAT CHARACTER.

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:55.512
TO PROVIDE AN AUTHENTIC POINT

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:57.213
OF VIEW A UNIQUE WORLD VIEW

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.282
THERE'S NOTHING THAT REALLY

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:01.151
EXPO REPLACES. LIFE EXPERIENCE

00:57:01.217 --> 00:57:03.119
AND AGAIN I WANT TO LIVE IN THE

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:04.854
IDEAL WORLD WHERE EVERYONE CAN

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:05.455
RIGHT FOR EVERYONE BUT THAT

00:57:05.522 --> 00:57:06.923
COMES WITH HAVING A GREAT

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.858
UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATION

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.860
AND AFFECTION FOR THAT CULTURE.

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:11.528
AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S SIMPLY

00:57:11.594 --> 00:57:13.329
NOT THERE YOU KNOW FOR A LOOK

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:16.900
FOR A LOT OF THESE WRITERS. SO

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:17.534
I WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS OF

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.169
HOW WE ARE PORTRAYED WHEN I

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:22.839
TALK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE OF

00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:23.473
SHOW RUNNERS SAYING YOU KNOW I

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.107
JUST CAN'T SEE THAT. YEAH RIGHT

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:25.141
SPECIFICALLY FROM THEIR POINT

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.976
OF VIEW OF GROWING UP IN YOU

00:57:27.043 --> 00:57:27.577
KNOW A WEALTHY SUBURB ON THE

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:29.279
EAST COAST HAVING GONE TO A

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:31.047
REALLY GREAT SCHOOL AND YOU

00:57:31.114 --> 00:57:31.548
KNOW THERE ONE CIRCLE OF

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:33.183
FRIENDS IF THEY DON'T SEE.

00:57:33.249 --> 00:57:36.886
PEOPLE OF COLOR YOU KNOW WHAT.

00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:37.520
OCCUPY A CERTAIN SPACE IN THEIR

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.122
LIVES THEY DON'T NEED IT AND IT

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:39.722
DOES MATTER THAT WE ON STAFF

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:41.324
HAVE C. HAVE THOSE PEOPLE GREW

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:43.159
UP WITH THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:45.295
TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT BECAUSE

00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:45.929
WHAT WE DO IS SUBJECT IF THEY

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:47.230
CAN CHOOSE NOT. SO REALLY IT IS

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:50.867
A BOTTOM AND YOU KNOW THE

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:51.434
AMAZING. THE I. WRITERS AND-

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:57.140
WRITERS WHO ARE. TO GO OUT AND

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:59.108
DEVELOP AND SELL. FROM THE

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:00.844
STUDIOS PICK UP THOSE SHOWS

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:01.411
BECAUSE AGAIN BECAUSE THERE

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:02.045
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME SUMMER

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.112
CAMP EXPERIENCES AS WE DO WITH

00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:03.746
THE FAMILY EXPERIENCES YOU KNOW

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:04.981
THE IT'S LESS LIKELY FOR AN

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:05.548
EXECUTIVE OR SOMEONE WITH

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:07.116
GREENLIGHT POWER TO SAVE I LOVE

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.018
THAT STORY I HAD THAT

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:09.652
EXPERIENCE I'M GOING TO BACK IT

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:13.056
ALL THE WAY THAT THE CHANCES OF

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:13.690
THAT HAPPENING WITH ONE OF OUR

00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:16.860
PROJECT IS MUCH MUCH LOWER.

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:17.427
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY IS

00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:17.961
ALMOST COMICAL TO ME THAT

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:20.964
THAT'S THIS. IT'S LIKE WOMEN

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.564
PEOPLE COLOR WE HAVE THE CODES

00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:22.999
WHICH ALL THE TIME WE HAVE NO

00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:23.566
LEGAL UNDER ROOM. HOW DO WE

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:24.968
HAVE TO CHANGE OURSELVES TO BE

00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:26.936
ACCEPTED IN THAT ROOM. AND

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:27.537
WHITE MAN ON THE TOTEM POLE

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:29.272
APART ON THE BOTTOM OF THE

00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:31.174
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO C.

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:31.708
PERSPECTIVE OTHER PEOPLE.

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:34.878
BECAUSE THE SOCIETY WHERE. SO

00:58:34.944 --> 00:58:35.545
BUT IT'S NOT UNUSUAL THAT'S THE

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:37.347
NORM I THINK IN MANY INDUSTRIES

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:39.048
WHERE. THE NORMATIVE

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:41.150
PERSPECTIVE IS THE WHITE MALE

00:58:41.217 --> 00:58:43.219
PERSPECTIVE. BUT YOU THINK THAT

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:44.921
ENTERTAINMENT. IT'S JUST THE

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:46.856
FACT THAT THAT'S THE NORM IN

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:48.858
ANY INDUSTRY IS COMICAL. BUT IN

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:49.492
ENTERTAINMENT WHEN YOU REALLY

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:50.960
WANT TO TRY TO. HAVE

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:52.962
INTERESTING STORIES AND I SEE

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:53.596
ALL THESE NEW SHOWS COMING OUT

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:55.098
IT'S THE SAME. KIND OF SAME

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:57.066
KIND OF EITHER DRAMA OR SIT COM

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:59.269
WITH ALL WHITE MILK WHAT WHAT

00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:01.137
ALL WHITE CAST. THE SAME THING

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:03.339
THEY JUST REGURGITATE OVER AND

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:05.141
OVER AGAIN SO I JUST SAW AN

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.210
INTERESTING. I JUST LIKE TO ADD

00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:09.045
ONE OF A SMALL NOTE TO THE IS

00:59:09.112 --> 00:59:09.679
THAT THE THRESHOLD OF. THERE IS

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:11.180
ALSO DIFFERENT FOR US. IN ANY

00:59:11.247 --> 00:59:13.016
GIVEN YEAR WE HAVE A LOT OF.

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:15.118
PILOTS THAT YOU WILL NEVER SEE

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:16.953
YOU KNOW THEY'LL TAKE A LOOK AT

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:19.289
THAT AND WHEN IT IS AS YOU KNOW

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:20.990
A SHOW RUNNER WITH. A WHITE

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:23.226
SHOW AND IT FEELS IT'S WELL THE

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:25.094
CHEMISTRY WASN'T RIGHT YOU KNOW

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:32.902
YOU CAN'T GET IT RIGHT. TIME.

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:33.503
BUT IF YOU ARE AN AGENT JANET

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:43.046
SURE MINE. DRIVEN. VERSUS YOU

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:45.081
KNOW IT THEY COULD HAVE. AGAIN

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:47.083
WHAT WE DO. SO SUBJECTIVE IT'S

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:49.052
IT IT'S AN ALCHEMY ALMOST AND

00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:51.354
SO YOU KNOW IT. IT REALLY HURTS

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:53.389
THE- THE WHOLE THE CAUSE OF

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:55.224
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. WHEN

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:57.226
OUR RACE BECOMES THE WITH M.

00:59:57.293 --> 00:59:59.295
THE REASON FOR THE FAILURE.

00:59:59.362 --> 01:00:01.164
RENTED PIGGYBACKING ON THAT

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:02.999
THAT MAKES THE- WINDOW.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:05.068
EXTREMELY SMALL BECAUSE THE

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:05.735
BARRIER TO ENTRY IS SO HIGH FOR

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:09.105
US. NOW IS TO GET THERE WHEN

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:11.040
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO FAIL AND

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:11.641
THEN WHEN WE DO IT'S NOT LIKE

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:15.311
JUST CLOSES. I HAVE ONE MORE

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:18.982

THINGS ARE CHANGING WE DON'T

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:37.126
HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:38.995
ANYMORE. BUT THE THING TO BEAR

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:39.629
IN MIND WAS WEAK BUT THE FIRST

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.330
ALL ASIAN CAST CONTEMPORARY

LEVERS THAT YOU CAN PUNCH. ON

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:41.644
THAT END. AND ANY THOUGHTS FROM

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.245
FROM THE POSITION AS A WRITER

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:45.581
IS THAT IT EVEN IN THE IN THE

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:47.283
UNIVERSE OR IS THAT JUST.

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:47.917
FINANCE IS I'M OUT OF MY DEPTH

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:48.517
THEY WAS WHAT MY MOTHER WANTS

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:49.285
ME TO MAJOR IN IN COLLEGE AND I

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.520
SADLY I DID NOT I JUST BECAME A

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.389
WRITER. BUT IT YOU KNOW I FROM

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:55.258
A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW IN

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:55.791
TERMS OF WHAT STUDIOS ARE

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:59.262
AFFECTED BY IT REALLY. IT'S SAD

01:04:59.328 --> 01:04:59.829
TO SAY I WISH IT WASN'T THE

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:01.664
CASE BUT IT IS A LOT OF TIMES

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.266
YOU KNOW EITHER PUBLIC SHAMING

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:05.468
OR SOMEHOW YOU KNOW. INCENTIVES

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:07.637
FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:08.204
THEIR PRODUCTIONS YOU KNOW

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:09.705
LOCALLY BETTER AT LEAST WORK AT

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.440
LEAST FOR CALIFORNIA YEAH THAT

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.376
WAS A LOT OF GRUMBLING IT. A

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:15.244
LOT OF DOCTORS USED TO BE

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:15.878
CENTERED IN LOS ANGELES AROUND

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:19.282
CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE LOSING A

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:19.915
LOT OF THAT TO ATLANTA TO YOU

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:23.419
KNOW NINE NORTH AND- I THINK

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.254
LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA. LOUISIANA

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:27.356
AND THERE IS THAT APPS

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:27.957
ABSOLUTELY THAT INTEREST IN

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:29.659
LIKE YOU KNOW PULLING THE

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:31.327
PULLING PRODUCTION BACK TO

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:33.629
CALIFORNIA. SO I FEEL LIKE

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:39.302
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD AREA.

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:43.506
TERMS OF LEVERAGE OKAY GREAT. I

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:44.140

ALL AREA THAT THAT'S ONE AREA

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:46.342
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FURTHER

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:47.610
EXPLORED YET YOU KNOW THAT

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:48.144
REQUIRES COAL PRODUCTION I

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:49.679
THINK WE CAN PROBABLY HELP OUT

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:51.380
TO SOME EXTENT DEPENDING ON

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.014
WHAT IT IS BUT IF THAT'S WERE

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:53.849

REFERRING TO AS AJ IT WAS

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.975
FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.844
WHICH IS EASY FOR ME TO

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:02.511
REMEMBER BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO MY

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:05.581
AIR. TO CREATE A COMMUNITY OF

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:06.148
SUPPORT FOR JOURNALISTS OF

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.783
ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:09.552
ISLANDER BACKGROUNDS. THE

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:11.587
ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZED EARLY

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.856
ON THAT JOURNALISTS NEED TO

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.758
SUPPORT AT EVERY LEVEL OF THEIR

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.760
CAREER FROM EXPIRING

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.695
JOURNALISTS IN HIGH SCHOOL

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:21.730
COLLEGE EARLY CAREER MADE

01:08:21.797 --> 01:08:23.866
CAREER. THOSE LOOKING TOWARDS

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.835
LEADERSHIP AND THOSE FEW OF US

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:27.703
THERE WERE FORTUNOFF TO ACHIEVE

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:31.640
LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. SO AJ

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:35.511
REALLY IDENTIFIED THIS PROBLEM

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:35.978
WITH THE DIVERSITY AND

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.513
INCLUSION IN THE JOURNALISM

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.582
INDUSTRY PRETTY EARLY ON AND

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:40.182
TRIES TO ADDRESS IT THROUGH

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:41.851
PROGRAMMING AND STRATEGY WHICH

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.819
IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.888
STRATEGY AND OUTRAGE SO TODAY

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.990
WE WANT TO ADDRESS THE FACT

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:49.792
THAT THE NEEDLE HAS MOVED VERY

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.894
LITTLE ON THE DESERT DIVERSITY

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.629
INCLUSION FRONTS IN THE

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:55.664
JOURNALISM INDUSTRY IN THE LAST

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.766
THIRTY YEARS. BECAUSE THAT'S

01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.869
WHAT'S AT STAKE ULTIMATELY IS

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:01.971
THE COVERAGE OF OUR COMMUNITIES

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:05.574
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND OUR

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:06.208
CAREER TRAJECTORIES WHICH WILL

01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:09.578
GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO AS

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:10.045
FAR AS HOW MESSY IT IS

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:11.614
ESPECIALLY ADDITIONAL SPACE

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.616
WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATED ABOUT

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.584
THE ENTERTAINMENT PANEL WAS

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:16.151
THAT HIERARCHY. OF THE TV'S

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:19.688
WRITERS GROUP. I WANT THAT FOR

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:20.289
THE DIGITAL SPACE I THINK YOU

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:21.757
KNOW NOT ONLY HAS OUR INDUSTRY

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:23.726
BEEN DISRUPTED BY YOU KNOW A

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.694
VERY BUSINESS ORIENTED

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.830
CHALLENGES AS FAR AS FINDING A

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.532
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.500
DECLINING AD DOLLARS. BUT ALSO

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.602
AT THE TECH INNOVATIONS THAT

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:34.136
HAVE HAPPENED AND LEGACY

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.771
ORGANIZATIONS NEEDING TO PAVE

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:37.907
IT OR MORE DIGITAL START UPS

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.675
KIND OF SPROUTING UP WE DON'T

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.510
HAVE ANYTHING NICE AND NEAT

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:42.144
LIKE THAT SO WE'RE STILL VERY

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:45.514
MUCH MAPPING OUT. TRAJECTORIES

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:46.115
FOR FOLKS AND WHAT CAREERS CAN

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.850
LOOK LIKE. THAT ACTUALLY IS

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.952
REFLECTED IN THE DATA THAT

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.520
WE'VE GOT OUR M. OUR INDUSTRY

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.622
RELIES ON A SURVEY BY THE

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.791
AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWS

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:57.760
EDITORS WHICH THEY STARTED

01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:58.394
COLLECTING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.630
EIGHT. AND THAT THE SERVICE

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:02.264
CHANGE A LITTLE BIT OVER THAT

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:03.899
TIME BUT BROADLY SPEAKING THE

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:05.634
SERVER NUMBERS INDICATE THAT.

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:07.803
IT IN IN BOTH AGGREGATE AND IN

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.638
PROPORTION THE INDUSTRY HASN'T

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:10.172
REALLY MADE A SIGNIFICANT

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.107
PROGRESS OVER THE PAST THIRTY

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:15.878
YEARS. AND SOME YOU KNOW THERE

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:17.913
ARE A FEW BRIGHT SPOTS AND

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.848
THERE ARE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:21.617
THAT HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:23.886
OVER THAT TIME. BUT GENERAL

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.721
CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY AND-

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.790
REALLY LEAVE LARGE GAPS AND

01:10:27.856 --> 01:10:30.059
HOLES YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DOES

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.727
IT MEAN AT THE WASHINGTON POST

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:33.796
HAS IMPROVED THEIR DIVERSITY

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.698
NUMBERS. TO PEOPLE LIVING IN

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.967
STOWE OR YOU KNOW TENAQUIP. I'M

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:41.870
AND- ARE ARE REALLY LARGE

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:43.906
CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE THINK

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.943
ABOUT COVERAGE AND JUST THE WAY

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:48.544
THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS REALLY

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:50.079
CHANGED. WE HAVE SEEN A GENERAL

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:53.649
COLLAPSE OF LOCAL REPORTING.

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.618
FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AS

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:57.720
BUSINESS MODELS OF SHIFTED FROM

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.855
NEWSPAPERS AND LOCAL TV

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:03.692
STATIONS TO ONLINE LET'S. AND

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:06.095
WHERE THAT DOLLARS EVERY ONE OF

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:11.800
BINGE GOOD LUCK TECH COMPANY. A

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:12.434
FEW COMPANIES THAT HAVE MANAGED

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:17.906
TO MAKE THAT. AND SO THAT THE

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:18.540
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS YOU KNOW

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:19.808
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ABOUT IN THE

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:20.376
SAME PLACES WHEN WE STARTED

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:21.010
COLLECTING DATA. THERE'S A PEAK

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:22.044
IN THE MID. TWO THOUSAND TWO

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:22.578
THOUSAND FIVE THROUGH TWO

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:23.846
THOUSAND SEVEN WHERE THERE IS A

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:26.081
SLIGHT BUMP BUTTON THAT WE JUST

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:26.682
ACTUALLY REGRESSED SINCE THEN.

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:28.083
SO I WISH I HAD BETTER NEWS ON

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:28.651
THAT FRONT BUT YOU KNOW THIS

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:29.752
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:31.954
THAT MAKE A REALLY BIG

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:32.521
DIFFERENCE AT THE LOCAL AND

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:35.824
STATE LEVEL. IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.726
SORTS OF STORIES GET TOLD WHO

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.895
IS TELLING THEM AND YOU KNOW

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.730
HOW THEY WERE AT AT THE EXTENT

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:42.264
TO WHICH THEY ACCURATELY

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:47.736
REFLECT THE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:51.774
ARE LIVING. AROUND THE STATE.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.441
OKAY THANK YOU. A QUESTION THAT

JUST A COUPLE. FOLLOW UP

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.880
QUESTIONS SO IN LIGHT OF THE

01:11:57.946 --> 01:11:59.982
CHANGING. LANDSCAPE OF

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:02.051
PUBLICATION I II GOING ONLINE

THAT THEY TALK ABOUT THE

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:30.446
CHALLENGES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:33.749
NOW AS AS WHEN THIS WAS WRITTEN

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:35.751
FIFTY AND- I GUESS ACTUALLY

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:50.432
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WE WERE

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.334
JUST READING AN EXCERPT FROM

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:53.869
NINETEEN NINETY THAT TALKS

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:54.503
ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM WE HAVE

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:56.271
NOW ACROSS INDUSTRIES WHICH IS

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:57.973
THAT WE ARE BEING HIRED. BUT

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.008
WE'RE NOT BEING PROMOTED WE'RE

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:00.609
NOT BEING EMPOWERED WERE NOT

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:04.046
BEING ELEVATED AND EITHER

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:05.914
THROUGH CONVERSATIONS AND

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:08.150
THROUGH COMMUNITY BUILDING JUST

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.985
IN THE JOURNALIST COLOR SPACE.

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:11.954
YOU FOUND THAT THERE IS A

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.856
THREAD A M. THAT MOST JOURNALS

01:13:13.922 --> 01:13:14.356
OF COLOR FOR REALLY FEEL

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:15.991
ACUTELY ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.127
DIGITAL. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.962
A NON TRADITIONAL ROLE WHICH

01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:22.231
JOEL SPACES RIFE UP WITH BROOKE

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:28.036
PRODUCERS. DATE OF FOLKS

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:30.139
DEVELOPERS THOSE NON

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:34.076
TRADITIONAL ROLES NOT THAT PORT

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:36.411
AT THE END OF THEY'RE OFTEN NOT

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:38.313
MIGHT NOT REDDIT. AND SO THE

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.182
PROJECT RESULT REALLY MURKY

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.117
THERE'S A PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:42.684
THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR FUTURE

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.019
COULD BE IN THE INDUSTRY AND SO

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:48.190
FOLKS WILL LEAVE. NOT KNOWING

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:48.824
YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU'RE IN THIS

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:55.964
INDUSTRY COULD LOOK LIKE. SO

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:56.598
SAID WHAT THEY ARE SAYING HERE

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.333
IS ABOUT THE GLASS CEILING YOU

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.002
SAID THAT BEGAN IN JOURNALISM.

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:00.636
ALL THE OTHER FIELDS PEOPLE GET

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:02.204
AP I GET HIRED. THEY'LL GET

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.339
PROMOTED WHAT DO YOU THINK IS

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:05.974
SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LEAST

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:06.542
NOW WE'RE MOVING TO DIGITAL

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:07.176
SPACE THERE'S LESS OF A CLEAR

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:08.310
PATH AS WELL. ALTHOUGH ONE

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:08.911
WOULD ARGUE I MEAN THAT THAT

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:10.212
IT'S THE PATH IS CLEAR NO

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:10.813
MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE IS SO

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:12.047
WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.149
PARTICULARLY BLOCKING API FROM

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:16.118
GETTING PROMOTED IN JOURNALISM

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:18.153
IS THAT STEREOTYPES ABOUT. OUR

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.322
YEAH ABOUT API AND OUR PEOPLE

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:24.293
SKILLS PERHAPS ARE ARE WHAT

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:24.860
WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT IN THE

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.428
JOURNAL OF SPACE THAT KEEPS API

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:32.201
FROM FROM MOVING UP IN THE

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:36.338
RANKS. I'M THERE ARE. LET'S SEE

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.307
HOW ABBAS FOR THIS IT. WHAT ONE

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:40.175
OF THE THINGS WITH THERE'S THE

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:40.776
SORT OF GENERAL QUESTION OF

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:41.343
LIKE HOW LARGE THE PIE IS AS

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.511
WELL I MEAN JUST THE NUMBER OF

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:42.978
OPPORTUNITIES AS OKAY

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:46.181
DECREASED. AND THAT THAT MEANS

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:48.250
THAT THE COUPLE COMPETITION IS

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.519
FEARS AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:52.187
DO PEOPLE RELY UPON WHEN

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:52.788
THEY'RE ACTUALLY. RECRUITING

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:54.356
FOR CANDIDATES IN LOOKING FOR

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.291
FULL AND SO THERE'S EVEN BEEN

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:58.093
DISCUSSIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:58.694
ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE RELYING

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.629
ON PEOPLE OF I BELIEVE WE GET

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:04.233
TO CATIONS RIGHT. AND SO THE

01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:06.535
AND THE DIVERSITY CHALLENGES

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.070
THAT YOU SEE IN THOSE PLACES

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:10.472
ACTUALLY ALSO WE EXACERBATE OUR

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:14.509
OUR. CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:16.311
HIRING PROMOTING. AND YOU KNOW

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:20.249
WHERE EVEN. WHERE DO WHAT

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:20.816
WHAT'S OUR ROLES TO DO ASIAN

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:22.451
AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS

01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:26.221
AND UP IN AND THERE'S A ISSUES

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.156
WITHIN THE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF

01:15:28.223 --> 01:15:30.092
DIVERSITY BEING SLOTTED INTO

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:30.692
FELLOWSHIP POSITIONS WHICH ARE

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.461
OFTEN PAID LESS THAN THE

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:34.496
STAFFER. AND THEN THE QUESTION

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:36.465
IS WHAT WHAT'S THE PROMOTION

01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:38.567
TRACK OUT OF THAT ANDERSON SO

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:40.469
YOU ADDING ANOTHER WRONG ON THE

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:41.003
BOTTOM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:44.206
TRYING TO CLIMB UP. OKAY

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:46.174
DIVERSITY IS OFTEN TREATED AS

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:48.210
THIS SEPARATE TOPIC ALMOST

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.145
LITERAL JOURNALISM SPACE. I'M

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:50.812
NOT SURE IF IT'S BECAUSE OF THE

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.547
NATURE OF OUR WORK THAT WE LIKE

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:54.283
TO PUT THINGS IN. TOPIC AREAS

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:56.218
AND BUCKETS AND WHAT NOT BUT

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.086
EVEN AT SOME OF OUR JOURNALISM

01:15:58.153 --> 01:15:58.754
CONFERENCES YOU'LL FIND THERE'S

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.322
A DIVERSITY TRACK. THAT

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:02.391
COMPETES WITH DATA JOURNALISM

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:02.824
THAT COMPETES WITH

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.393
INVESTIGATIVE AND SO IF YOU'RE

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:06.361
A JOURNALIST TRYING TO. LEVEL

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:08.530
UP YOU HAVE TO PICK BETWEEN

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:10.098
DIVERSITY AND INVESTIGATIVE

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:10.699
SKILLS LIKE THAT'S THAT'S A

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.701
REALLY ODD CONFLICT THAT'S KIND

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:16.104
OF HAPPENING THAT WE SEE. IN

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:18.240
THE IN A VERY TANGIBLE WAY. I

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:20.375
THINK ANOTHER VERY SPECIFIC

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:22.477
THING THAT I'VE LOOKED AT

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:26.114
PERSONALLY IS HIRING PROCESS

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:28.517
HIRING PRACTICES. SO IT'D LEE.

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:32.254
TOM AND ALICE HAVE A VERY

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:32.821
DEMANDING JOB AND IF YOU'RE

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.323
HIRING ON TOP OF IT. THAT'S

01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:36.391
ANOTHER DUTY ON TOP OF FULL

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:37.025
TIME JOB SO TO THE CREDIT OF A

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:40.495
LOT OF FOLKS I'VE SPOKEN TO IN

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:44.399
LEADERSHIP I THINK. ANALYZING

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:46.535
WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW THAT

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:47.135
PLAYS OUT HAS BEEN A REALLY

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:47.803
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION OVER THE

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:48.637
LAST COUPLE YEARS MEANING IF

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:50.605
YOU'RE TOO BUSY TO HIRE WHAT

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:52.441
SHORT CUTS TO YOU TAKE. AND IF

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.343
LEADERSHIP IN JOURNALISM IS NOT

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:56.578
DIVERSE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:58.647
THEN WHEN FOLKS UP TOP. OUR

01:16:58.714 --> 01:17:02.217
DIVERSE. OUR MAJORITY WHITE.

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:04.219
AND THEY'RE TAKING SHORT CUTS.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.288
THAT MEANS THAT ULTIMATELY THE

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:06.855
FOLKS BEING HIRED ARE MOST

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:08.590
LIKELY GOING TO LEÓN THAT WAY

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:10.459
FROM DIVERSE CANADA THEY'RE

01:17:10.525 --> 01:17:11.093
RELYING ON THEIR NETWORKS WORD

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.627
IS NOW IF YOU KNOW PEOPLE THEY

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:14.329
CAN TRUST THAT THEY BELIEVE

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:16.198
THEY CAN TRUST TO GET THE JOB

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:18.200
DONE AND THE QUESTION IS. ARE

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:18.800
YOU ACTUALLY RUNNING A PROCESS

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:22.304
THAT GIVES ALL APPLICANTS. SORT

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:24.406
OF AN EQUAL SHOT AT GETTING

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:28.310
THOSE ROLES SO SOME NEW IDEAS

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:28.944
AND THESE ARE EXACTLY RIGHT AS

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:30.412
FOR SOME IDEAS. LORD I'VE

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.381
WORKED VERY WELL IS YOU KNOW

01:17:32.447 --> 01:17:32.914
COULD YOU COULD YOU BE A

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:34.516
DEVELOPING A HIRING COMMITTEE

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:36.218
THAT SUPPORTS THIS HIRING

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:38.253
MANAGER WHO IS ADMITTEDLY A

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.222
SHORT ON TIME. AND RESOURCES

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:44.226
AND CAN THEY GIVE JUST A LARGER

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:48.330
RANGE OF PERSPECTIVE. TO A

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:54.236
CANDIDATE POOL MEETING YOU. I.

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:56.304
ACTIVE ALL CANADA. THEY

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.507
RECOGNIZE THE MORE OBSCURE

01:17:58.573 --> 01:17:59.107
PUBLICATION FOLKS WHO NO THIS

01:17:59.174 --> 01:17:59.741
PERSON TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:00.442
A LITTLE BIT MORE OFF THE WALL

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:02.310
AND NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL KIND

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:02.911
OF BUCKET OF JOURNALISM SELLS

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:04.212
AND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SUPPORT

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:04.846
AND JUST GIVE ALL OF A LARGER

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.615
RANGE OF PERSPECTIVE TO THAT

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:08.483
CONVERSATION AND SO HIRING

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.485
COMMITTEES THAT DIVERSITY

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:12.421
COMMITTEES THOSE HAVE BEEN

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.222
SOMETHING THAT HAVE WORKED WELL

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:16.224
TO TACKLE THIS REALLY SPECIFIC

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:16.825
PROBLEM BUT I THINK RETENTION

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:18.560
OF RISING RETENTION ARE STILL

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:20.429
VERY MUCH. BOB PROBLEMS AND

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:22.397
WE'RE DEALING WITH WE SEE THAT

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:24.499
EVEN WITHIN AJ COMMUNITY WHERE

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.401
SOME OF OUR CHAPTER LEADERS OF

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:27.002
PEOPLE WHO LEFT THE INDUSTRY

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:30.338
THEY THEY'RE STILL IMPORTANT

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:32.541
RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:34.709
YOU STARTING THEIR CAREER

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:38.380
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:40.549
A LITTLE WHILE BUT THE FACT

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:44.586
THAT THEY DON'T SEE A PLACE FOR

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:48.490
THEMSELVES. IN IN THE END. I'M

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.592
A- DISTRICT. AND WHEN THE OTHER

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:51.226
AGAIN WITH THE SHRINKING OF THE

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:52.661
PIE IS YOU KNOW. CITIES USED TO

01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:53.295
HAVE TWO NEWSPAPERS AND SO YOU

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:54.529
KNOW IF YOUR WRITER THAN MAYBE

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:55.097
COULD BETH BETWEEN THEM BUT

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:55.697
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE. THE

01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:56.765
ONLY SO MANY SLOTS TO LIVE IN

01:18:56.832 --> 01:19:00.335
THAT COMMUNITY AND SO YOU KNOW

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:00.936
AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.704
ABOUT THAT AND I SHOULD MENTION

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.739
ABOUT THE S. ANY SURVEY IS THAT

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:06.408
WE THE DIRECTION THE

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:08.343
INDUSTRY'S. HEADED IS HOW YOU

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.345
BEST HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.314
REPRESENT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.616
AS REFLECTED IN THE CENSUS OF

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.318
THEIR ACTUAL ACTION TRYING

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:18.320
WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:20.322
WHERE THE NEWS ROOM LITERALLY

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:22.757
DOES REFLECT THE COMMUNITIES.

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:24.493
WHERE STILL OTHER. QUESTION

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:26.561
ABOUT STEREO TYPES IN A I THINK

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:28.430
LEADERSHIP TRAINING IS ALSO

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:29.030
ANOTHER REALLY EFFECTIVE WAY

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:32.567
TO. TACKLE PART OF THIS

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:36.638
PROBLEM. AND IN THAT. CELL IN

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:38.507
THE IN THE EXECUTIVE THE SHIP.

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:39.107
THAT I TOOK. WITH AJ I THINK

IN THE STORY. SO THERE WILL

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:09.097
COME IS A VERY LOW. COMPANY

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:15.236

REPRESENTATION. WE ALL KNOW

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:47.108
THAT AND THE AND SO THE DATE IS

NICE BUT THAT BETTER BETTER

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:51.145
THING YOU DO THE DATA IS STILL

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:51.712
CALCULATION. AND LOOK AT THE

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:55.183
FALLOUT. THROUGH THE PIPELINE.

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:57.185
SO WE CREATED THERE'S TWO TO

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:57.852
TWO TERMS OKAY WANT US TO LOOK

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.353

APPOINT A NINE POINT. TEN POINT

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:13.467
NINETY IS. POINT TWENTY FIVE.

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:15.169
WHAT THAT MEANS IS PERCENTAGE

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.538
AT THE TOP. IS ONLY 25% AT THE

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:19.340
CENTER OF THE BOTTOM THE IWIN

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.442
TRIP THAT IS SENTRY ASIAN

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:25.446

CASE OF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AS

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:48.469
A BASIC CONCEPT. AND THE NICE

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:49.470
THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THEN I

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:51.439

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:11.525
OUR LOAN OF THEIR DID THERE'S

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:13.594
NOT A SIGNIFICANT. THE MORE

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:15.496
SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS ARE FOR IT

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:17.598
ASIAN MEN ASIAN WOMEN COMPARED

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:46.153
WHITE WOMEN ARE ABOVE PARITY IN

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:51.292
MIDDLE MANAGEMENT. ALL

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:53.294
COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:55.629
SAMPLE ALL ASIAN MEN AND ASIAN

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:59.333
WOMEN ARE BELOW PARITY IN

01:33:59.400 --> 01:33:59.834
MIDDLE MANAGEMENT UNDER

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.335
REPRESENT MIDDLE MANAGERS. IN

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:03.504
THE END AND THERE AVERAGE HERE

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:05.339
THE OTHER SILICON VALLEY ONE

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:07.375
THIRTY SEVEN IT'S REALLY THAT

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:08.009
THE NUMBERS THAT WERE ACTUALLY

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:09.710
PUT TOGETHER A BY THE BUT YOU

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:13.280
RECEIVE HAMPSHIRE ON A PROJECT

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:13.814
THEY DID THEY DID FOR THE

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:17.284
CENTER OF INVESTING REPORTING

01:34:17.351 --> 01:34:17.885
AND REVEAL THAT LOOKED AT THE

01:34:17.952 --> 01:34:19.487
ACCURATE NUMBERS SO HOLLY. AND

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:21.288
THAT AVERAGE SO WAS ESSENTIALLY

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:27.328
BUT A WHITE MAN OR WHITE WOMAN.

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:27.962
SUCH HAS A DOUBLE THE UP DOUBLE

01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:29.330
THE CHANCE OF BEING PROMOTED.

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:33.567
AMANDA RACHEL SO THIS IS THE

01:34:33.634 --> 01:34:35.736
VALUE OF THE DATA AND ANALYSIS

01:34:35.803 --> 01:34:37.571
OF POINT OKAY I'M YOU CAN FIND

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:39.640
AGGREGATED DATA AT THE EEOC NOT

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.609
INDIVIDUAL AGGREGATED DATA AT

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:43.811
THE IT IT BUT YOU'LL SEE

01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:45.613
WEBSITE AND IT'S EVERY YEAR BY

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:47.815
NET FIND NATIONAL DATA. STATE

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:49.483
AND LOCAL DATA. AND WITHIN

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:50.117
THOSE AGGREGATIONS YOU CAN FIND

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:51.685
IT BY SECTOR. SO FOR EXAMPLE I

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:53.521
CAN LOOK AT CALIFORNIA. AND

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:55.589
HERE'S THE NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:57.625
ALL INDUSTRIES IN EACH MATCH

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:58.192
BALL THE LARGE METROPOLITAN

01:34:58.259 --> 01:35:01.495
AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. AND A

01:35:01.562 --> 01:35:02.096
COMPUTER EXACTLY PARITY INDEX

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:05.299
FOR EACH OF THESE. AND THE

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:05.933
THING THAT NOTE IS THAT BY AND

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:06.500
LARGE TO SHAPE THE CURVE IS

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:09.737
CENTRAL ST. THAT ASIAN MAN AN

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:11.772
ASIAN WOMEN ARE FARING LESS

01:35:11.839 --> 01:35:12.373
WELL THAN WHITE MEN AND WHITE

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:15.509
WOMEN. IT SAYS AGAIN IF YOU

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:17.378
LOOK AT SUCCESS IS THE GENDER

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:17.945
GAP. BUT THE UPSHOT OF THIS

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:19.547
CHART SHOULD BE THIS. IF YOU'RE

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:21.482
GONNA HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.617
THE GLASS CEILING YOU HAVE TO

01:35:23.684 --> 01:35:25.453
HAVE A DISCUSSION OF RACE AND

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:27.521
GENDER AND IN EFFECT AND THE

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:28.155
EFFECT OF THE INTERSECTION OF

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:31.425
BOTH. THAT'S WHAT THIS SHOWS.

01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:33.928
SO IN SUMMARY I WANT TO SUM UP

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:37.398
CENTRAL WHAT WE FOUND. WITH OUR

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:37.998
RESEARCH USING IO ONES. NUMBER

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:43.404
ONE. THAT AT LEAST THE DATA IS

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:43.971
THE DATA IS AND WE FOCUS ON

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:45.606
SILICON VALLEY FOR BECAUSE

01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:47.741
WE'RE HERE. WE FOUND BASICALLY

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:51.512
THAT THAT ASIAN AND ASIAN WOMEN

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:52.012
ARE THE LEAST LIKELY BE

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.747
PROMOTED. SO FOUND BY THE WAY

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:55.549
THAT LOOKED AT DATA NOT JUST

01:35:55.616 --> 01:35:57.384
FOR ASIANS BUT FOR BLACK

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:58.018
HISPANICS WE ALSO SEE IS ALL

01:35:58.085 --> 01:36:01.522
THE NUMBERS OF. OF BLACKS

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:02.089
HISPANICS HAVE INCREASED I

01:36:02.156 --> 01:36:03.390
SHOULD RATHER THAN PATIENT

01:36:03.457 --> 01:36:05.493
DECREASED SO AS A REGION WE'RE

01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:06.127
NOT DOING WELL SO THAT'S OTHER

01:36:06.193 --> 01:36:07.862
OTHER VALUE OF THE DATA SO YOU

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:11.398
CAN LOOK. AT EVERYBODY'S

01:36:11.465 --> 01:36:13.534
REPORTS IN CONTEXT OF WHAT'S

01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:15.669
GOING ON OKAY SO THE DATA IS

01:36:15.736 --> 01:36:19.640
THERE. IT'S ONLY THE POWER FOR

01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:20.241
THE COMPANIES THAT ARE WILLING

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:23.777
SCHOOL. AS TO THE CENTER FOR

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:25.646
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING. I

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:29.450
ACTUALLY WANTED TO GET. FILED A

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:30.084
FEED RESERVATION REQUESTS TO A

01:36:30.151 --> 01:36:31.819
LOT OF COMPANIES AND WE'RE DONE

01:36:31.886 --> 01:36:33.554
DIED THEY SUED THEM. AND GOT A

REPORTS FROM BUT I THINK TEN

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:37.725
OTHERS. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:39.393
UNWILLING TO RELEASE REPORTS.

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:41.495
THAT LIMITS WHAT WE CAN DO IN A

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:42.029
COMPARISON VALLEY AND THE

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:43.998
NUMBERS IN SOME VALUE ALL THOSE

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:45.566
AVAILABLE THEY'RE NOT

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:47.568

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:32.466
HUNDRED CORPORATE BOARDS WHICH

01:44:32.532 --> 01:44:33.100
WE'VE BEEN PRODUCING SINCE TWO

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:34.601
THOUSAND FOUR. AND I BELIEVE

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:36.870
THAT I BILL I REALLY BELIEVE IN

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:38.705
THE SCENE. WHAT GETS MEASURED

01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:42.676
GETS DONE. AND LIKE THE A

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:44.378
SENATE REPORT THAT WAS AUTHORED

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:46.446
BY BUCK G. ANTONY'S PACK THE

01:44:46.513 --> 01:44:48.548
MISSING PIECES REPORT IS MEANT

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:52.352
TO SHINE A SPOTLIGHT. ON FAX

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:54.354
AND THE FACT BASED REALITY

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:56.490
ABOARD SENSES NUMBER AND IN THE

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:58.525
PROCESS SPUR GREATER AWARENESS

01:44:58.592 --> 01:44:59.026
AN OPTION FOR INCREASED

01:44:59.092 --> 01:45:00.894
INCLUSION OF DIVERSE DIRECTORS

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:02.796
ON CORPORATE BOARDS. WHAT MORE

01:45:02.863 --> 01:45:04.898
SPECIALLY I BELIEVE THAT USING

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:08.602
DATA THAT WE PRODUCE FOR

01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:10.470
REPORTS LIKE THIS ALSO DEBUNKS

01:45:10.537 --> 01:45:12.606
THE MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:14.641
OVER REPRESENTATION OF ASIAN

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:16.376
AMERICANS ON CORPORATE BOARDS.

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:20.647
UNFORTUNATELY EVEN IN SPACES

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:22.482
THAT YOU WOULD THINK PEOPLE NO.

01:45:22.549 --> 01:45:24.551
DON'T ALWAYS REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:26.653
THE TRUE NUMBERS AND OFTEN

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:27.287
TIMES A STUDENT THAT ASIANS ARE

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:28.588
MUCH BETTER REPRESENTED THEN

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:30.724
WHEN WE REALLY ARE AND I WILL

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.659
SAY THAT IT'S BEEN TO MY SHOCK

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:33.260
FORTUNATELY AND I'M NO LONGER

01:45:33.326 --> 01:45:36.463
SHOCKED. THAT IN THE DIVERSITY

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:38.665
AND INCLUSION SPACE WHO I FEEL

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:40.867
SHOULD KNOW BETTER DON'T OFTEN

01:45:40.934 --> 01:45:42.903
KNOW BETTER AND THEY'RE OFTEN

01:45:42.969 --> 01:45:46.873
TIMES WHEN TWEET THE SAME IT

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:50.610
ASSISTS ANYONE ELSE'S. WE'LL

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.479
SHARE THAT IN THE NUMBERS THAT

01:45:52.546 --> 01:45:53.113
ARE GONNA SPEAK ABOUT THERE ARE

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:53.680
INDICATORS FOR OPTIMISM FOR

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:54.648
THIS COMMUNITY OUR COMMUNITY

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:55.248
THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:55.882
BUT I WILL SAY THAT ADVANCEMENT

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:56.850
IS SLOW AND CORPORATE BOARDS

01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:58.552
ARE NOT STILL REPRESENTATIVE OF

01:45:58.618 --> 01:46:00.687
THE BROAD DEMOGRAPHIC

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:01.321
TRANSFORMATIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:46:01.388 --> 01:46:02.756
IN THIS COUNTRY. QUEEN TWENTY

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:04.825
SIXTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:06.560
SAW THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:07.194
AVAILABLE CORPORATE BOARD SEATS

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:10.530
GROW LARGER BY ABOUT TWO

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:11.164
HUNDRED THIRTY SEATS SO IN AN

01:46:11.231 --> 01:46:12.866
ANALOGY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:14.634
THE PIE HAS GROWN SLIGHTLY

01:46:14.701 --> 01:46:16.737
LARGER. AND INSTEAD OF JUST

01:46:16.803 --> 01:46:18.472
GETTING A SLIVER NOW WE GET

01:46:18.538 --> 01:46:19.072
MORE OF A SLICE IN TERMS OF

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.640
WOMEN AND MINORITIES. BUT WHAT

01:46:20.707 --> 01:46:22.809
WE'RE SEEING IS THAT GROWTH IS

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:24.811
BEING LED BY FORTUNE ONE

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:28.482
HUNDRED COMPANIES. AND YET

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:30.550
ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE

01:46:30.617 --> 01:46:32.486
SPECIFICALLY I'LL JUST SAY THIS

01:46:32.552 --> 01:46:34.554
ASIAN AMERICANS GREW FASTEST IN

01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:36.556
TERMS OF BOARD SEATS ON THE

01:46:36.623 --> 01:46:38.492
FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:40.761
LIST. AGAIN AS I MENTIONED

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:42.496
UNDER REPRESENTATION STILL

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:46.500
ISSUE BUT HERE ARE SOME CONTEXT

01:46:46.566 --> 01:46:48.468
FOR SMALL WHAT I'M GONNA SHARE

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:50.570
ON FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED BOARDS.

01:46:50.637 --> 01:46:51.138
EIGHT TEN AMERICAN WOMAN LET

01:46:51.204 --> 01:46:54.741
THE GAME. GROWTH RATE OF THIRTY

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:56.643
EIGHT POINT 6% SUCH A PRETTY

01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:57.244
IMPRESSIVE RIGHT THIRTY EIGHT

01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.844
POINT SIX PERCENT. IT'S ONLY

01:46:57.911 --> 01:47:02.582
SEVENTEEN SEATS. ON THE FORTUNE

01:47:02.649 --> 01:47:03.150
ONE HUNDRED ASIAN AMERICAN

01:47:03.216 --> 01:47:06.720
WOMEN GAINED THIRTY POINT 8% IN

01:47:06.787 --> 01:47:07.254
TERMS OF TOTAL BOARD SEATS

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:12.692
GROWN. IT WAS ONLY FOUR SEATS.

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:15.128
SO WHAT ARE WHY I'M SAYING THIS

01:47:15.195 --> 01:47:17.164
IS THAT THE PERCENTAGES SAY ONE

01:47:17.230 --> 01:47:18.865
THING BUT THE ACTUAL WRONG

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:20.834
NUMBER SAY SOMETHING ELSE AND

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:22.936
OUR NUMBERS AS ASIAN AMERICANS

01:47:23.003 --> 01:47:24.805
WHEN OUR NUMBERS ARE SO LOW TO

01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:26.873
BEGIN WITH ANY GROWTH IS GOING

TO SEEM LIKE WOW A LOT OF

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:30.644

ACTUAL RUN NUMBERS IT'S REALLY

01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:34.781

AFRICAN AMERICAN HISPANIC.

01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:38.778
DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS HOWEVER I

01:48:38.845 --> 01:48:42.616
WANT TO MENTION THAT. FOR THE

01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:44.751
TECH AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS

01:48:44.818 --> 01:48:46.786
IF WE LOOK AT THE THIRTY FIVE

01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:48.722
COMPANIES THERE ONLY TO TECH

01:48:48.788 --> 01:48:49.256
COMPANIES THAT HAD BROAD

01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:50.857
DIVERSITY. H. P. N. H. P.

01:48:50.924 --> 01:48:54.928
ENTERPRISES. AND THERE ARE ONLY

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:58.598
TWO ENTERTAINMENT COMPANIES

01:48:58.665 --> 01:48:59.099
THAT HAVE THE BROADEST

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:00.734
DIVERSITIES COMCAST

NBCUNIVERSAL AND WALT DISNEY.

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:06.606
THAT WAS IT NOT SURPRISING

01:49:06.673 --> 01:49:07.274
GIVEN THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:11.011
NO LAW FIRMS NO NO NEWSPAPERS

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:12.712
NO BIG SURPRISE RIGHT. SO I

01:49:12.779 --> 01:49:13.346
THOUGHT I JUST MENTIONED THAT

01:49:13.413 --> 01:49:16.750
THAT THERE'S SOME BUT THERE'S A

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:18.752
LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE I

01:49:18.818 --> 01:49:19.352
LASTLY I WANT TO JUST MENTION

01:49:19.419 --> 01:49:21.121
IN TERMS OF THE CORPORATE BOARD

01:49:21.187 --> 01:49:23.089
REPORT I JUST WANT TO MENTION

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:25.158
THAT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR- THE

01:49:25.225 --> 01:49:27.027
USE OF THE WORDS ASIAN AND

01:49:27.093 --> 01:49:28.895
PACIFIC ISLANDERS. I WANT TO

01:49:28.962 --> 01:49:29.462
JUST NOTE THAT THERE IS A

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:32.699
COMPLETE ABSENCE OF NATIVE

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:33.333
HAWAIIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.770
ON CORPORATE BOARDS AND SO FOR

01:49:36.836 --> 01:49:37.337
THE RECORD I WANTED TO JUST

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:39.072
STATE THAT BECAUSE I THINK

01:49:39.139 --> 01:49:41.041
OFTEN TIMES. I THINK FROM AN

01:49:41.107 --> 01:49:43.143
ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY

01:49:43.209 --> 01:49:44.945
PERSPECTIVE WE'RE FIGHTING FOR

01:49:45.011 --> 01:49:46.813
RECOGNITION I THINK TOO OFTEN

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.347
WERE IN SPACES WERE WERE

01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:49.082
COMPLETELY ERASED AND

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:50.717
OVERLOOKED. AND I THINK THE

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:51.284
SAME OUR IS BEING DONE TO

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:53.086
NATIVE HAWAIIANS AND PACIFIC

01:49:53.153 --> 01:49:55.155
ISLANDERS. I DO WANT TO JUST

01:49:55.221 --> 01:49:57.057
SAY THAT DIVERSITY DOES WORK

01:49:57.123 --> 01:49:58.892
AND IT MATTERS BUT I THINK. IT

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:01.094
TAKES SUPPORTERS. POLICY MAKERS

01:50:01.161 --> 01:50:03.196
LIKE YOU ADVOCATES LIKE ALL OF

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:05.231
US HERE. TO STAY AWARE AND TO

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:07.133
ENSURE THAT WE DON'T GET

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:10.971
COMPLACENT AND THAT. WITH THE

01:50:11.037 --> 01:50:13.039
DATA THAT WE GAIN WE GET A

01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:15.008
BETTER LEYVA LOUD BUT THERE'S

01:50:15.075 --> 01:50:17.077
ACTIONS THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE

01:50:17.143 --> 01:50:19.179
TAKEN. SO FROM A POLICYMAKER

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:21.181
PERSPECTIVE I WILL RECOMMEND

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:24.884
THE STEPS ONE. I APPRECIATE AND

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:25.452
I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO

01:50:25.518 --> 01:50:28.822
CONTINUE RAISING THESE ISSUES.

01:50:28.888 --> 01:50:31.024
I THINK IN ABLE TO EDUCATE

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:31.658
PEOPLE MORE BROADLY IT'S GONNA

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:33.259
BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK

01:50:33.326 --> 01:50:35.028
THERE'S CONTINUE. TO BE. S.

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:37.097
MISPERCEPTION ABOUT OUR OVER

01:50:37.163 --> 01:50:38.965
REPRESENTATION. I THINK

01:50:39.032 --> 01:50:44.904
CONTINUING TO ASK. THE

01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:45.538
QUESTIONS WHETHER IT'S M. PRIDE

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:49.142
OR ISN'T. ALL THE COMPANIES

01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:50.877
DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:51.478
IMPORTANT AS WELL TOO BECAUSE

THESE QUESTIONS. PEOPLE START

01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:57.117
TO TAKE NOTICE NOT ONLY FROM A

01:50:57.183 --> 01:50:58.885
FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE BUT

01:50:58.952 --> 01:51:00.820

IMPORTANT THAT WE CHALLENGE

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:04.858
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM BECAUSE I

01:51:04.924 --> 01:51:06.826

01:51:06.893 --> 01:51:08.928

01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:47.914
FOR ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:51.684
ISLANDER INTACT IS BOTH COMPLEX

01:54:51.751 --> 01:54:52.318
SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S ALREADY

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:53.720
BEEN REVEALED I'M IN IN WAYS

01:54:53.786 --> 01:54:55.588
IT'S COMPLETE AS WE HAVE A LACK

01:54:55.655 --> 01:54:56.122
OF DISAGGREGATED DATA IN

01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:57.657
TRANSPARENCY OF DATA ON

01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:59.626
SPECIFIC SUBGROUPS AND THAT

01:54:59.692 --> 01:55:01.527
REALLY I THINK CAMPERS. OUR

01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:03.830
ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF

01:55:03.896 --> 01:55:05.632
THE TRENDS AND TO MAKE AND THIS

01:55:05.698 --> 01:55:07.533
ONE'S ABOUT INTERVENTIONS SO

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.902
JUST TO START OFF IN CASE OF

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:13.840
EDUCATION YOU MIGHT THE ASIANS

01:55:13.906 --> 01:55:15.541
DO OVER OPEN IN COMPUTERS THE

01:55:15.608 --> 01:55:21.781
DUCATION. BUT NOT THE FULL

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:27.887
STORY. THE FACT I DID THE WE

01:55:27.954 --> 01:55:29.656
NOW HAVE DIFFERENT. THE

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:30.256
VIETNAMESE STUDENTS ARE SIMONE

01:55:30.323 --> 01:55:30.823
STUDENTS VERSUS CHINESE AND

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:31.991
KOREAN STUDENTS WE ALSO FOUND

01:55:32.058 --> 01:55:32.592
THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE

01:55:32.659 --> 01:55:33.192
ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY

01:55:33.259 --> 01:55:33.760
TO HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTER

01:55:33.826 --> 01:55:34.360
SCIENCE EDUCATION AND THEN OF

01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:35.628
THE ASIAN STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:36.262
TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE 70% ARE

01:55:36.329 --> 01:55:37.730
MALE SO GOING BACK TO BUCKS

01:55:37.797 --> 01:55:38.331
POINT THERE IS. WE MUST PAY

01:55:38.398 --> 01:55:39.799
ATTENTION TO BOTH INTERSECTION

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:40.366
OF REASONS UNDER I'M IN THE

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:41.934
TECH WORK FORCE JUST TO

01:55:42.001 --> 01:55:43.936
REITERATE WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN

01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:45.705
SAID THANKS TO THE GROUND

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:46.306
BREAKING RESEARCH BY ASCENDS

01:55:46.372 --> 01:55:47.940
FOUNDATION AND ALSO US AND DO

01:55:48.007 --> 01:55:49.942
JEFF RING CARED JAN AT REVEAL

01:55:50.009 --> 01:55:53.579
NEWS. WE KNOW THAT THE

01:55:53.646 --> 01:55:54.180
ADVANCEMENT OF ASIAN AMERICANS

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:55.748
IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN TECH

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:59.719
IN SILICON VALLEY ASIAN ASIANS

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:01.688
MAKE UP ABOUT 30% OF ALL TECH

01:56:01.754 --> 01:56:02.088
EMPLOYEES BUT THE

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:03.756
REPRESENTATION DECREASES

01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:05.825
SIGNIFICANTLY OUT THAT BOTH THE

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:06.426
MANAGERIAL AND EXECUTIVE LEVEL

01:56:06.492 --> 01:56:08.094
WHICH WE JUST SAW FROM EO ONE.

01:56:08.161 --> 01:56:11.664
A REPORT EXAMPLE I'M AND AGAIN

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:13.766
DATA OR WORK FOR ASIAN WOMEN

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:16.135
AND ASIAN WOMEN ACTUALLY C. N.

01:56:16.202 --> 01:56:18.037
N. OUT COMPLETELY OPPOSITE

01:56:18.104 --> 01:56:19.772
TREND FROM WHITE WOMEN SO I

01:56:19.839 --> 01:56:21.774
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE

01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:23.976
TO POINT OUT. AS WE HEAR A LOT

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:25.745
OF TALK ABOUT OUR DIVERSITY IN

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:29.682
TECH. WE ALSO A STUDY IN THE

01:56:29.749 --> 01:56:35.888
SIXTEEN REVERSED. WHICH BUT

01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:39.859
INCLUDE WITH AN- S. AN OVERT

01:56:39.926 --> 01:56:41.928
BIAS RIPPING. OFF MAN THIRD

01:56:41.994 --> 01:56:43.763
TYPING TO BEING PASSED OVER FOR

01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:44.397
PROMOTION WERE EXPERIENCES THAT

01:56:44.464 --> 01:56:44.997
FOLKS WHO WENT THERE IN THE

01:56:45.064 --> 01:56:45.798
DOOR IN TECH COMPANIES. WERE

01:56:45.865 --> 01:56:46.366
THAN DRIVING THEM OUT SO I

01:56:46.432 --> 01:56:46.933
THINK THAT ANOTHER QUESTION

01:56:46.999 --> 01:56:47.934
ABOUT THE DATA IS. WHO'S BEING

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:48.534
PASSED OVER FOR PROMOTION AND

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:49.669
STAYING OUT OF A LOWER LEVEL

01:56:49.736 --> 01:56:51.704
AND WHOSE ACTUALLY LEAVING I

01:56:51.771 --> 01:56:52.338
THINK TED IS EXAMPLE OF LEAVING

01:56:52.405 --> 01:56:53.806
TO GO START A COMPANY. SO IN

01:56:53.873 --> 01:56:55.975
ADDITION TO BIAS IN HIRING

01:56:56.042 --> 01:56:57.744
PROMOTION I'M JUST WANT TO

01:56:57.810 --> 01:56:58.344
POINT OUT THAT INCLUSION IS

01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:00.012
REALLY CRITICAL. AND THEN WE

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:02.014
ALSO SEE THE GLASS CEILING FOR.

01:57:02.081 --> 01:57:03.783
ASIAN WOMEN SPECIFICALLY

01:57:03.850 --> 01:57:05.818
EXTENDING INTO ENTREPRENEURSHIP

01:57:05.885 --> 01:57:07.954
AND VENTURE CAPITAL. AND THIS

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.989
IS AN AREA THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

01:57:10.056 --> 01:57:10.590
TON OF DATA BUT ASIANS AS A

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:12.091
WHOLE COMPRISE JUST 12% OF ALL

01:57:12.158 --> 01:57:14.327
START UP FOUNDERS EVEN THOUGH

01:57:14.394 --> 01:57:15.895
THEY'RE MUCH LARGER. PROPORTION

01:57:15.962 --> 01:57:17.964
OF THE TECH WORK FORCE. AND WE

01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:19.966
DID A SMALL STUDY OF ABOUT

01:57:20.032 --> 01:57:21.868
FIFTY FEMALE TECH FOUNDERS AND

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:25.805
FOUND THAT. SORRY FIFTY FEMALE

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:27.840
TECH FOUNDERS AND FOUND THAT.

01:57:27.907 --> 01:57:29.976
EAST SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH ASIAN

01:57:30.042 --> 01:57:31.778
X. IT WOMEN EXPERIENCE

01:57:31.844 --> 01:57:32.278
STEREOTYPES ABOUT RACE

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:33.880
UNWELCOME COMMENTS ABOUT

01:57:33.946 --> 01:57:35.782
LANGUAGE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN.

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:36.416
ETCETERA DURING THE PROCESS OF

01:57:36.482 --> 01:57:39.786
PITCHING THEIR COMPANIES IDEAS.

01:57:39.852 --> 01:57:40.286
AND THAT BEN US A FAX

01:57:40.353 --> 01:57:42.188
DISPARITIES IN IN CAPITAL THAT

01:57:42.255 --> 01:57:43.956
COULD BE INVESTED IN THEIR

01:57:44.023 --> 01:57:46.159
COMPANIES. AND THEN IN VENTURE

01:57:46.225 --> 01:57:49.796
CAPITAL ASIAN MEN ARE THREE

01:57:49.862 --> 01:57:50.296
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE

01:57:50.363 --> 01:57:53.866
INVESTORS THAN ASIAN WOMEN. SO

01:57:53.933 --> 01:57:56.002
IN CONCLUSION I WE KNOW ASIAN

01:57:56.068 --> 01:57:56.569
POPULATIONS ARE THE FASTEST

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:57.804
GROWING IN THE U. S. AND ALSO.

01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:58.404
RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE PEW

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:00.173
RESEARCH CENTER SO THAT ANY

01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:01.974
QUALITY WITHIN THE ASIAN

01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:03.810
COMMUNITY IS GROWING MOST

01:58:03.876 --> 01:58:04.377
RAPIDLY THAN ANY OTHER SUB

01:58:04.444 --> 01:58:06.045
GROUP WHICH IS. A REALLY

01:58:06.112 --> 01:58:07.814
IMPORTANT PIECE TO POINT OUT.

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:09.949
AND SO AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES

01:58:10.016 --> 01:58:12.118
TO PLAY. AN INTEGRAL PART OF

01:58:12.185 --> 01:58:14.153
OUR ECONOMY AND ESPECIALLY OUR

01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:15.922
ECONOMY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I

01:58:15.988 --> 01:58:16.289
HAVE THREE QUICK

01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:18.157
RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE

01:58:18.224 --> 01:58:19.959
PARTICIPATION AND SUCCESS. OF

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:22.028
API'S ONE IS REALLY

01:58:22.094 --> 01:58:26.098
ARTICULATING THE NEED FOR US

01:58:26.165 --> 01:58:27.967
AGGREGATED DATA COLLECTION. IN

01:58:28.034 --> 01:58:30.036
C. AND REPORTING SO DE

01:58:30.102 --> 01:58:30.670
SEGREGATION AT. THE STATE LEVEL

01:58:30.736 --> 01:58:32.138
IN EDUCATION DATA AT THE

01:58:32.205 --> 01:58:34.140
NATIONAL LEVEL. I'M NATIONAL

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:35.908
SCIENCE FOUNDATION DEPARTMENT

01:58:35.975 --> 01:58:36.542
OF EDUCATION AND THAT THE WORK

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:42.114
FORCE LEVEL WITH THE EEOC DATA

01:58:42.181 --> 01:58:42.648
AND ALSO WITH THE COMPANY

01:58:42.715 --> 01:58:46.219
DIVERSE REPORTS. AND THEN.

01:58:46.285 --> 01:58:46.819
SPECIFIC THIS IS THE RESEARCH

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:48.387
ON. ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:49.989
POPULATIONS THAT ARE MOST

01:58:50.056 --> 01:58:50.556
UNDERSERVED AND USING THAT

01:58:50.623 --> 01:58:51.090
INFORMATION TO HELP DRIVE

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:54.193
INTERVENTIONS. AND THEN

01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:56.295
SECONDLY COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:58:56.362 --> 01:58:58.130
ACCESS AND EQUITY IN K. TWELVE

01:58:58.197 --> 01:58:59.999
AND AGAIN FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:00.633
ON WHAT WHO ARE THE POPULATIONS

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.268
THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING

01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:04.470
SERVED. WITH A FOCUS ON LOW

01:59:04.537 --> 01:59:06.205
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND GIRLS.

01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:08.207
AND THEN FINALLY INCREASING

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:10.142
UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:59:10.209 --> 01:59:10.743
EXPERIENCES THAT ARE AT THE

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:12.345
INTERSECTION OF RACE AND GENDER

01:59:12.411 --> 01:59:14.280
AFFECTING ASIAN AMERICAN

01:59:14.347 --> 01:59:16.282
PACIFIC ISLANDER WOMEN AND THEN

01:59:16.349 --> 01:59:18.284
TARGETING INTERVENTIONS TOWARDS

01:59:18.351 --> 01:59:24.123
A SOLUTION. SO WITH THAT I

01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:24.690
WOULD LIKE TO JUST THANK YOU

01:59:24.757 --> 01:59:25.291
AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY GIVE

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:26.392
SOME REMARKS. THANK YOU AND

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:32.465
FINALLY. I'LL JUST DO A QUICK

01:59:32.532 --> 01:59:33.132
THANK YOU OKAY SAYING THEY WERE

01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:36.168
RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO I AM THE

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:38.104
CEO OF WATER MARK AND WATER

01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:38.671
MARK IS THE LARGEST WOMEN'S

01:59:38.738 --> 01:59:40.406
ORGANIZATION IN THE STATE OF

01:59:40.473 --> 01:59:44.277
CALIFORNIA M. AS WAS MENTIONED

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:48.114
IN MY BIO WE FOCUS ON

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:50.249
DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN AND WE

01:59:50.316 --> 01:59:52.451
ALSO FOCUS ON THE INTERSECTION

01:59:52.518 --> 01:59:54.186
ALLERGY ISSUES. WOMEN FACE. SO

01:59:54.253 --> 01:59:54.787
I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:59:54.854 --> 02:00:00.226
ABOUT AN EXAMPLE SO WE WERE

02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:00.826
SORT OF BOOK ENDING WITH TED

02:00:00.893 --> 02:00:04.263
AND I IN TERMS OF A OF A

02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:04.931
PERSONAL EXAMPLE AND THIS IS IN

02:00:04.997 --> 02:00:08.267
REFERENCE TO WHAT I SAW WHEN I

02:00:08.334 --> 02:00:10.403
WAS CHIEF IN MY TIME AS CHIEF

02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:12.305
DIVERSITY OFFICER AT CISCO. AND

02:00:12.371 --> 02:00:14.240
I THINK THIS WILL REINFORCE

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:14.840
SOME OF THE REQUESTS THAT WERE

02:00:14.907 --> 02:00:20.346
MADE. SO WHAT HAPPENED WHAT I

02:00:20.413 --> 02:00:22.615
NOTICED DURING MY TENURE AS

02:00:22.682 --> 02:00:24.517
CHIEF DIVERSITY OFFICER IS IT'S

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:26.452
PRETTY SIMPLE AND EASY TO

02:00:26.519 --> 02:00:28.287
UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES AND

02:00:28.354 --> 02:00:30.423
CHALLENGES FOR BLACK AND LATINO

02:00:30.489 --> 02:00:32.358
X. POPULATIONS IT'S A

02:00:32.425 --> 02:00:34.527
RECRUITMENT ISSUE AND SO WHEN

02:00:34.594 --> 02:00:36.462
YOU'RE WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S A

02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:37.063
RECRUITMENT ISSUE BECAUSE YOU

02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:38.764
HAVE MINISCULE POPULATIONS YOU

02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:40.666
CAN RECRUIT AT ANY LEVEL WHICH

02:00:40.733 --> 02:00:42.768
MEANS YOU CAN RECRUIT A V. P.

02:00:42.835 --> 02:00:46.439
N. S. VP OR AN EXECUTIVE. THAT

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:47.106
HAS A HIGHER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK

02:00:47.173 --> 02:00:50.643
THEN IF YOUR CREW A FIRST LEVEL

02:00:50.710 --> 02:00:54.580
PERSON YOU KNOW AT. AN AN ENTRY

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:56.616
LEVEL ENGINEER. WHAT WE FOUND

02:00:56.682 --> 02:00:58.651
WAS THAT THERE REALLY THE

02:00:58.718 --> 02:01:02.321
PERCEPTION AS HAS BEEN SPOKEN

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:04.390
ABOUT WAS THAT THERE WAS AN

02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:08.327
OVER SUBSCRIPTION OR CERTAINLY

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:10.529
ADEQUATE POPULATION IN AT THE

02:01:10.596 --> 02:01:14.400
ASIAN PACIFIC POPULATION AND SO

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:16.602
I WAS APPROACHED BY BACH IN ONE

02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:18.337
OF HIS COLLEAGUES AND DENISE

02:01:18.404 --> 02:01:20.506
AND ACTUALLY A GROUP OF TWELVE.

02:01:20.573 --> 02:01:24.577
ASIAN LEADERS AT AT CISCO WHO

02:01:24.644 --> 02:01:26.646
SAID WE THINK THAT THIS HAS TO

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:28.748
BE RAISED TO OUR CEO JOHN

02:01:28.814 --> 02:01:30.483
CHAMBERS AT THE TIME. SO WE

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:32.551
ARRANGED A MEETING WITH JOHN

02:01:32.618 --> 02:01:34.854
AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:36.455
BE A VERY QUICK MEETING JOHN

02:01:36.522 --> 02:01:38.557
ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A

02:01:38.624 --> 02:01:39.158
VERY QUICK MEETING AND THOUGHT

02:01:39.225 --> 02:01:40.493
WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE HOW WELL

WHILE WE SHARED WITH HIM THE

02:02:04.650 --> 02:02:08.354
ACTUAL DATA AROUND IT'S NOT A

02:02:08.421 --> 02:02:08.921
REPRESENTATION ISSUE AND IN

02:02:08.988 --> 02:02:12.525
FACT YOU'RE COUNTING ON THE

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.593
ASIAN POPULATION TO SHORE UP OR

02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:16.696
NUMBERS OUR OUR AGGREGATE

02:02:16.762 --> 02:02:20.533
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. OUR

02:02:20.599 --> 02:02:21.200
ASIAN POPULATION DOES NOT MOVE

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:22.635
UP THROUGH THE RANKS AND SO THE

02:02:22.702 --> 02:02:24.503

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:26.439
THE TWELVE IN THE ROOM. NICE

02:02:26.505 --> 02:02:28.641
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:02:28.708 --> 02:02:29.275
REPRESENTATION AND I LOVED YOUR

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:30.776
PYRAMID. WE'RE ALL AT THE

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:32.845
BOTTOM PREDOMINANTLY AND WHEN

02:02:32.912 --> 02:02:34.947
YOU GET TO THE TOP OF THAT

02:02:35.014 --> 02:02:36.682
PYRAMID IT'S ABYSMALLY SMALL.

02:02:36.749 --> 02:02:38.751
AND PROPORTIONATELY IN AND

02:02:38.818 --> 02:02:42.688
THAT'S WHY THE ASCEND REPORT

02:02:42.755 --> 02:02:44.590
THAT SHOWS THAT PROPORTION IT.

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:46.792
PRESENTATION IS SO POWERFUL SO

02:02:46.859 --> 02:02:48.861
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT MEETING

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:50.563
AND THIS IS WHY I THINK THIS IS

02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:51.163
AN IMPORTANT STORY EVEN THOUGH

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:52.932
IT'S A BIT DATED WHAT HAPPENED

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:54.800
IN THE MEETING. IS WHAT WAS

02:02:54.867 --> 02:02:56.702
SUPPOSED TO BE A SHORT MEETING

02:02:56.769 --> 02:02:58.838
JOHN IMMEDIATELY SAID WE NEED

02:02:58.904 --> 02:03:00.906
MORE TIME. SO HE SAID THIS IS

02:03:00.973 --> 02:03:02.775
AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I NEED

02:03:02.842 --> 02:03:04.643
TO DIG INTO IT AND SO HE

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:06.612
LISTENED AND HE HEARD THE

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:08.714
ISSUES AND CHALLENGES THAT WERE

02:03:08.781 --> 02:03:10.549
ACTUALLY BEING FACED BY HIS

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:12.685
LARGE HIS SECOND LARGEST

02:03:12.752 --> 02:03:14.820
PERCENT. OF HIS EMPLOYEES WERE

02:03:14.887 --> 02:03:18.691
FACING A CRITICAL ISSUE AND HE

02:03:18.758 --> 02:03:22.828
HAD NO IDEA OF IT. ONCE HE

02:03:22.895 --> 02:03:26.932
KNEW. AT W. EXTENDED MEETINGS

02:03:26.999 --> 02:03:28.768
HE SAID OKAY WE HAVE TO MAKE AN

02:03:28.834 --> 02:03:29.335
INVESTMENT AND WE HAVE TO DO

02:03:29.401 --> 02:03:32.638
SOME THINGS. SO HE PUT TWO

02:03:32.705 --> 02:03:33.272
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:03:33.339 --> 02:03:36.876
IN TWO REALLY DENISE'S HEAVENS

02:03:36.942 --> 02:03:38.677

IN. ME AS CHIEF DIVERSITY

02:03:44.650 --> 02:03:46.652
OFFICER THE LEADERS COME BACK

02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:48.788
IN WITH SOLUTIONS AND PART OF

02:03:48.854 --> 02:03:50.756
THOSE SOLUTIONS WERE LEADERSHIP

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:52.725
DEVELOPMENT BUT PART OF THOSE

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:54.927
SOLUTIONS WERE A SPONSORSHIP

02:03:54.994 --> 02:03:56.562
PROGRAM PART OF THE SOLUTIONS

02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:57.196
WERE OTHER. ELEMENTS THAT WE

02:03:57.263 --> 02:04:00.800
KNEW WE HAD TO. SHIFT IN THE

02:04:00.866 --> 02:04:02.835
CULTURE AND SO ESSENTIALLY THIS

02:04:02.902 --> 02:04:06.572
EXAMPLE. HAS BEEN PLAYED OUT

02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:07.173
FOR ME AND IN MY CONSULTING

02:04:07.239 --> 02:04:09.008
WORK THROUGH THE YEARS AND ALSO

02:04:09.074 --> 02:04:10.910
WHAT I HEAR FROM THE SENIOR

02:04:10.976 --> 02:04:12.678
EXECUTIVE LEADERS THAT

02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:14.647
PARTICIPATED WATERMARK IF YOU

02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:18.784
AND I THINK. ON HE SAID THIS

02:04:18.851 --> 02:04:20.853
INITIALLY USING A MEDICAL

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:22.688
METAPHOR IF YOU DON'T KNOW

02:04:22.755 --> 02:04:24.690
THERE'S A MEDICAL ISSUE YOU

02:04:24.757 --> 02:04:26.826
CAN'T FIND A CURE. DIVERSITY

02:04:26.892 --> 02:04:28.661
PROBLEMS ARE HARD AND WE KNOW

02:04:28.727 --> 02:04:29.261
BRING THAT IS NOT OF A QUICK

02:04:29.328 --> 02:04:31.063
FIX AND IT'S NOT IN A PIT BUT

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:32.998
THERE'S NO MAGIC PILL BUT IF

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:34.934
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU HAVE A

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:35.501
PROBLEM YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO

02:04:35.568 --> 02:04:37.002
ADDRESS IT. I WILL TELL YOU THE

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:38.938
EXPERIENCE THAT WAS VERY

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:41.040
DIFFERENT AND THAT'S ONE THAT

02:04:41.106 --> 02:04:42.908
WE SAW WITH THE HR SEE WHICH IS

02:04:42.975 --> 02:04:44.877

IN TERMS OF SUPPORT. BILL G.

02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:55.321

ARE NOT. THE TWO PRONGED

02:04:59.058 --> 02:05:01.026
APPROACH NOT ONLY DOES THAT

02:05:01.093 --> 02:05:01.627
VISIBILITY FORCE COMPANIES TO

02:05:01.694 --> 02:05:02.995
SAY WE BETTER BE ON THAT LIST

02:05:03.062 --> 02:05:03.629
BECAUSE WE WANNA TRACKED GOOD

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:06.699
TALENTED FOR NOT. BUT CONSUMERS

02:05:06.765 --> 02:05:10.769
OF COMPANY PRODUCTS ALSO KNOW

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:11.403

DIVERSITY AND MY POPULATION AND

02:05:47.373 --> 02:05:49.275

02:08:52.791 --> 02:08:53.559
THE BOARD TO MAKE UP. AND CAN

02:08:53.625 --> 02:08:54.159
YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS AND

02:08:54.226 --> 02:08:55.594
HOW THAT WORKS PLEASE YEAH SO

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:57.396
WHAT IT TAUGHT WHAT IT SPEAKS

02:08:57.463 --> 02:08:59.364
TO IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU

02:08:59.431 --> 02:09:01.300
WERE PLACED ON SCHOOL BOARD. OR

02:09:01.366 --> 02:09:03.235
ACTUALLY MAYBE VERNON JORDAN'S

02:09:03.302 --> 02:09:03.735
PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS

02:09:03.802 --> 02:09:05.637
EXAMPLE VERNON JORDAN SAT ON

02:09:05.704 --> 02:09:06.271
SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT OR NINE

02:09:06.338 --> 02:09:09.475
DIFFERENT BOARDS AND SO FORTH.

02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:11.343
EACH TIME HE- IS SITTING L.

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:15.314
OCCUPYING ABOARD C. WHAT THAT'S

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:17.382
CALLED IS HOW MANY TIMES HAS HE

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:19.318
BEEN QUOTE UNQUOTE RECYCLED

02:09:19.384 --> 02:09:21.753
ONTO A DIFFERENT FULLER AFTER.

02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:25.524
YEAH GOT IT OKAY. FOR DOCTOR

02:09:25.591 --> 02:09:27.593
SCOTT. THE NUMBERS AGAINST

02:09:27.659 --> 02:09:29.394
ASIAN WOMEN'S IS STAGGERING. AS

02:09:29.461 --> 02:09:29.962
YOU MENTIONED. SO I'M JUST

02:09:30.028 --> 02:09:33.432
WONDERING ARE WE DOING ENOUGH

02:09:33.499 --> 02:09:35.601
TO RECRUIT THEM. YOU KNOW TO

02:09:35.667 --> 02:09:37.669
ENTER THE ARCHITECT FEEL OUR

02:09:37.736 --> 02:09:39.671
AND AT WHAT LEVEL WOULD WE- TWO

02:09:39.738 --> 02:09:41.673
AT MOST EFFECTIVE WITH A LET'S

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.809
SAY YOU KNOW IT WHETHER IT'S

02:09:43.876 --> 02:09:44.376
THE COLLEGE LEVEL OR EVEN A

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:47.679
LITTLE LOWER. YEAH I THINK

02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:48.280
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I

02:09:48.347 --> 02:09:49.982
THINK. SO WE HAVE A PROJECT

02:09:50.048 --> 02:09:51.917
BASED ON WOMEN OF COLOR IN

02:09:51.984 --> 02:09:53.619
COMPUTING AND WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:09:53.685 --> 02:09:55.621
ENTIRE PIPELINE AND I THINK K.

02:09:55.687 --> 02:09:56.155
TWELVE IS OBVIOUSLY VERY

02:09:56.221 --> 02:09:57.956
CRITICAL AND THEN YOU SEE KIND

02:09:58.023 --> 02:09:59.892
OF A DROP OFF OVER TIME I'M FOR

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:01.894
ALL GROUPS I'M FOR ALL. GROUPS

02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:03.862
OF WOMEN ARE WOMEN FROM ALL

02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:05.898
BACKGROUNDS I WOULD LOVE TO DIG

02:10:05.964 --> 02:10:07.866
INTO MORE OF THE DATE OF THE C.

02:10:07.933 --> 02:10:09.601
WHERE SPECIFICALLY THE DROP OFF

02:10:09.668 --> 02:10:10.169
IS FOR ASIAN WOMEN BUT GIVEN

02:10:10.235 --> 02:10:12.004
THE- GIVEN THE FACT THAT ONLY

02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:15.707
70% ARE ONLY 30% OF THE ONES

02:10:15.774 --> 02:10:17.743
TAKING A PCS ARE. ARE WOMEN I

02:10:17.809 --> 02:10:20.012
WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

02:10:20.078 --> 02:10:22.047
THERE'S A SOMETHING THAT WE

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:24.049
COULD BE DOING AND I PRE K.

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:27.719
TWELVE EDUCATION AS WELL AND

02:10:27.786 --> 02:10:28.320
DON'T WANT TO I MEAN I THINK

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:30.022
THIS COVERS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:10:30.088 --> 02:10:32.124
SAY THAT THIS IS UP A PIPELINE

02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:33.825
ISSUE IN THAT WE DON'T JUST

02:10:33.892 --> 02:10:34.459
FOCUS THERE AND SAY IF WE JUST

02:10:34.526 --> 02:10:36.061
FIX K. TWELVE THEN WE CAN FIX

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:37.796
ISSUES IN THE WORKPLACE OR IN

02:10:37.863 --> 02:10:43.635
IN A- PROMOTION BUT ABSOLUTELY

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:44.236
I THINK IT'S WORTH. IT TO DO.

02:10:44.303 --> 02:10:49.942
OKAY THANK X. JUST CLICK JUST

02:10:50.008 --> 02:10:51.843
JUST IT JUST COVER SOME TURN.

02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:52.411
CHECK THE C. SILICON VALLEY

02:10:52.477 --> 02:10:53.045
FREES UP THE NUMBERS WE LOOKED

02:10:53.111 --> 02:10:54.112
AT. TWENTY SIXTY. TWO THOUSAND

02:10:54.179 --> 02:10:54.646
FIFTEEN. 40% OF THE TECH

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:55.981
WORKERS WERE ASIAN WOMEN.

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:56.582
SENATE TECH WORKERS WERE WHITE

02:10:56.648 --> 02:11:01.687
WOMEN. GOT IT GOT IT THANK YOU.

02:11:01.753 --> 02:11:03.822

02:11:03.889 --> 02:11:07.659
PRESENTATIONS YES IN TERMS OF

02:11:07.726 --> 02:11:09.761
SO SOME YOUR SUGGESTION SEEMS

02:11:09.828 --> 02:11:11.797
TO IMPLY THAT PERHAPS ONE OF

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:12.397
THE CHALLENGES AND THIS IS A

02:11:12.464 --> 02:11:13.966
CHALLENGE FOR I THINK MANY

02:11:14.032 --> 02:11:14.566
MINORITY GROUPS IS I GUESS A

02:11:14.633 --> 02:11:17.803
LACK OF. WHAT COULD TERM SOCIAL

02:11:17.869 --> 02:11:19.838
CAPITAL NETWORKING ABILITY AND

02:11:19.905 --> 02:11:25.744
SO FORTH. AND THEN I REALIZED

02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:26.378
THAT THAT THESE TWO THINGS MAY

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:29.748
ALSO INTERACT TO WHAT DEGREE IS

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:31.817
IT THE LACK YOU KNOW SO YOU

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:33.885
WERE AN ASIAN AND- WORKING

02:11:33.952 --> 02:11:35.821
ATTACK STERN ALOT OF ASIANS AND

02:11:35.887 --> 02:11:36.421
SENIOR MANAGEMENT SO YOU HAVE

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:38.190
VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO THINK OF

02:11:38.257 --> 02:11:39.858
YOU TO PULL YOU UP. NOT THAT

02:11:39.925 --> 02:11:40.459
THE PERSON HAS TO BE ASIAN TO

02:11:40.525 --> 02:11:42.060
PULL YOU UP BUT YOU'RE LESS

02:11:42.127 --> 02:11:43.862
LIKELY HAVE. YOU KNOW MAYBE

02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:44.396
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OTHER

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:46.131
THINGS. TO WHAT DEGREE IS IT

02:11:46.198 --> 02:11:48.133
THAT THE SORT OF THE YOUR OF

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.868
CONNECTIONS ARE MAINLY WITH

02:11:49.935 --> 02:11:50.535
PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN RANK AND NOT

02:11:50.602 --> 02:11:52.204
THERE FOR PEOPLE ABOVE SO YOU

02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:53.972
DON'T GET PULLED UP. VERSUS

02:11:54.039 --> 02:11:56.008
STEREOTYPES LIKE ASIANS JUST

02:11:56.074 --> 02:11:57.776
AREN'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOOD

02:11:57.843 --> 02:11:58.377
ENGINEERS ARE JUST NOT GOOD

02:11:58.443 --> 02:12:05.851
MANAGERS. AND THAT AND SO. SO

02:12:05.917 --> 02:12:06.418
I'M JUST TRY IT TRYING TO

02:12:06.485 --> 02:12:08.053
FIGURE OUT THAT PARTICULAR

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.755
ATTENTION ABOUT STEREOTYPES

02:12:09.821 --> 02:12:10.389
VERSES LIKE. HEY YOU KNOW WHAT.

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:10.989
YEAH JOHNNY IS A REALLY GOOD

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:12.157
PERSON AND BUT I'VE NEVER GOT

02:12:12.224 --> 02:12:14.126
IT I DON'T REALLY THINK OF HIM

02:12:14.192 --> 02:12:14.760
AS IT DID GOES BACK TO WHAT I

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:16.261
SEE PEOPLE AS- I DON'T SEE THAT

02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:18.163
PERSON AS A C. L. OR AS A

02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:20.065
SENIOR MANAGER BECAUSE- THEY'RE

02:12:20.132 --> 02:12:21.900
REALLY GOOD ENGINEERING CODING

02:12:21.967 --> 02:12:24.136
BUT THEY'RE NOT SO GOOD. YEAH

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:25.871
BUT I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW. SO I

02:12:25.937 --> 02:12:30.142
DID START. I THINK IT'S A

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:31.943
COMBINATION OF BOTH THINGS. AND

02:12:32.010 --> 02:12:34.079
I HAVE DONE. INCLUSIVE

02:12:34.146 --> 02:12:36.081
LEADERSHIP TRAINING. ACROSS THE

02:12:36.148 --> 02:12:38.183
BOARD FROM THE FORTUNE FIVE

02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:39.985
HUNDRED SO THAT START UPS. WHAT

02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:43.922
I HEAR CONSISTENTLY IS A

02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:44.556
COMBINATION OF BOTH THINGS ONE

02:12:44.623 --> 02:12:47.993
IS. A LACK OF SPONSORSHIP FROM

02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:49.895
SENIOR PEOPLE PULLING PEOPLE UP.

02:12:49.961 --> 02:12:52.331
AND THERE ARE NOT PEOPLE LIKE

02:12:52.397 --> 02:12:54.132
ME AND I THINK IT WAS SAID BY A

02:12:54.199 --> 02:12:56.068
FEW PEOPLE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE

02:12:56.134 --> 02:12:57.936
TO LOOK AT THAT SENIOR TEAM AND

02:12:58.003 --> 02:13:00.038
SAY THEY'RE PEOPLE LIKE ME I'M

02:13:00.105 --> 02:13:00.706
GONNA STICK IT OUT AND TOUGH IT

02:13:00.772 --> 02:13:02.474
OUT AND FIND THOSE ADVOCATES

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:04.309
AND NETWORK IN MY OWN WAY. SO

02:13:04.376 --> 02:13:06.311
THERE IS THAT IS A LACK AND

02:13:06.378 --> 02:13:08.180
THAT IT THAT IS OF CONCERN THE

02:13:08.246 --> 02:13:11.983
SECOND THING IT IS THAT THEY'RE

02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:14.086
ABSOLUTELY ARE NOT JUST

02:13:14.152 --> 02:13:14.586
UNCONSCIOUS BIASES BUT

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:17.989
CONSCIOUS VERY CONSCIOUS BIASES

02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:21.993
THERE ARE. THERE CONTINUE TO BE

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:26.098
THE QUESTIONS OF WHERE YOU KNOW

02:13:26.164 --> 02:13:27.999
WHERE YOU REALLY FROM I'M FROM

02:13:28.066 --> 02:13:28.567
OHIO NO BUT WHERE YOU. FROM

02:13:28.633 --> 02:13:33.972
REALLY FROM OHIO. THOSE KINDS

02:13:34.039 --> 02:13:34.606
OF THINGS GREAT ON PEOPLE THEY

02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:36.141
DEMORALIZED PEOPLE AND ALL OF

02:13:36.208 --> 02:13:36.775
THOSE THINGS SO YOU'RE FACED

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:38.577
WITH I DON'T SEE ANYONE LIKE ME

02:13:38.643 --> 02:13:40.412
IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT I DON'T

02:13:40.479 --> 02:13:42.280
HAVE ANYONE ADVOCATING FOR ME

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:44.182
UNLESS THEY'RE ASSIGNED. IT'S

02:13:44.249 --> 02:13:46.151
HARDER FOR ME TO NETWORK ALL

02:13:46.218 --> 02:13:48.286
UP. AND THERE'S THE PERCEPTION

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:48.754
THAT I DON'T HAVE THE

02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:50.422
LEADERSHIP SKILLS BECAUSE I'M

02:13:50.489 --> 02:13:52.557
I'M ESPECIALLY IF I'M OUT ON

02:13:52.624 --> 02:13:54.393
ASIAN WOMAN. I DON'T SPEAK UP

02:13:54.459 --> 02:13:56.261
ON NOT ASSERTIVE IT CETERA

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:58.397
ETCETERA AND ALL OF THE OTHER

02:13:58.463 --> 02:14:00.565
BIASES THAT COME ALONG SO

02:14:00.632 --> 02:14:02.267
YOU'RE FIGHTING THE STEREO

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:04.436
TYPES THE BIASES. AND YOU DON'T

02:14:04.503 --> 02:14:06.271
HAVE THOSE ROLE MODELS AT THE

02:14:06.338 --> 02:14:10.308
SAME TIME SO IT'S A SORT OF A

02:14:10.375 --> 02:14:14.346
ONE TWO PUNCH. IT IS A. ALSO

02:14:14.413 --> 02:14:16.448
HAVE SOME ANSWERS THAT QUESTION

02:14:16.515 --> 02:14:18.350
BUT I'M SCOTT IT'S UP TO THE

02:14:18.417 --> 02:14:18.884
LOW ANDY CAN IF ANYONE TO

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:19.384
FOLLOWS UP DANCE YOU CAN

02:14:19.451 --> 02:14:22.487
REFLECT. SO OFTEN THERE'S YOU

02:14:22.554 --> 02:14:22.954
KNOW WHAT SOME OF THE

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:23.588
SUGGESTIONS ARE WE NEED TO HAVE

02:14:23.655 --> 02:14:24.356
MORE LIKE LEADERSHIP TRAINING

02:14:24.423 --> 02:14:24.990
AND SO FORTH AND I'M NOT SAYING

02:14:25.056 --> 02:14:26.224
THAT THAT DOESN'T HAVE VALUE.

02:14:26.291 --> 02:14:28.560
BUT TO WHAT DEGREE WOULD BE. IS

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:30.495
THE PROBLEM REALLY THAT THE

02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:32.664
PERSON HAS A LACK OF LEADERSHIP

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.366
TRAINING AND SKILLS AND- AND

02:14:34.433 --> 02:14:36.501
TODAY WE PREFER C. LIKE MAYBE I

02:14:36.568 --> 02:14:37.102
GOT MORE LEADERSHIP TRAINING

02:14:37.169 --> 02:14:40.338
I'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE UP VERSUS.

02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:42.207
WELL IF THE PERSON WHO'S HIRING

02:14:42.274 --> 02:14:44.209
THE BUT THAT LEVEL. YEAH WASN'T

02:14:44.276 --> 02:14:46.344
SO DISCRIMINATORY ARE HAD

02:14:46.411 --> 02:14:48.480
PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHO I WAS

02:14:48.547 --> 02:14:52.384
IS IT IS US IS THAT. THAT'S A

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:52.851
LEADERSHIP TRAINING IS

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:54.486
IMPORTANT BUT TO WHAT DEGREE

02:14:54.553 --> 02:14:55.086
ARE PEOPLE SEEKING LEADERSHIP

02:14:55.153 --> 02:14:55.554
TRAINING EMBEDDING IN

02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:56.521
THEMSELVES. AT A SENSE THAT

02:14:56.588 --> 02:14:58.323
THEY'RE MISSING SOMETHING THAT

02:14:58.390 --> 02:15:00.292
IS IT REALLY A LACK IN

02:15:00.358 --> 02:15:02.194
THEMSELVES BUT IS REALLY A LACK

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:02.727
IN THE PERSON WHO AND THE

02:15:02.794 --> 02:15:04.463
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSE THE

02:15:04.529 --> 02:15:06.264
HIRING THEM LIKE. SO WE GOT ALL

02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:06.865
THESE ARE TRAINING THEY WANT

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:08.667
BUT IT IS ALSO KNOWN PERCEIVE

02:15:08.733 --> 02:15:10.502
THEM AS HAVING IT YEAH THEY'RE

02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:12.337
NEVER GOING TO. PREVENT THEM SO

02:15:12.404 --> 02:15:14.539
WHAT WELL I WOULD SAY IT'S TWO

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:16.374
FOLD IT'S THE IT'S- IT'S NOT

02:15:16.441 --> 02:15:16.908
JUST DEVELOPING YOUR OWN

02:15:16.975 --> 02:15:18.577
LEADERSHIP SKILLS I THINK IT'S

02:15:18.643 --> 02:15:20.479
MORE OF AN ISSUE OF DEVELOPING

02:15:20.545 --> 02:15:22.280
LEADERSHIP SKILLS OF LEADERS OR

02:15:22.347 --> 02:15:22.881
SELECTING THE PEOPLE. ONE OF

02:15:22.948 --> 02:15:24.483
THE THINGS WE'RE DOING AT

02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:26.318
WATERMARK IS WE'RE WORKING WITH

02:15:26.384 --> 02:15:28.320
SOME COMPANIES LIKE PIPELINE

02:15:28.386 --> 02:15:30.388
EQUITY THAT SAY FOR EVERY

RACIAL INFORMATION AND THE NAME

QUALIFIED PERSON YOU NEED TO

JUSTIFY WHAT WHY NOT. SO THAT

02:15:44.803 --> 02:15:48.306
FILTER OUT THE IF THESE. AND

02:15:48.373 --> 02:15:50.308
WE'RE HELPING COMPANIES THAT

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:52.511
WATERMARK PARTNER TO SAY YOU

02:15:52.577 --> 02:15:54.546

DODD BIASED. AT THE SAME TIME I

ALSO THINK YOU WANT TO. A.

02:16:08.426 --> 02:16:10.428
WANTED THEIR OWN. SKILLS THAT

02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:11.062
THAT'S A NO BRAINER BUT I DON'T

02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:12.731
THINK THAT'S THE HOLD UP OKAY

02:16:12.797 --> 02:16:14.633
WHAT I'D LIKE. JUMP IN ON THIS

02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:16.601
CONVERSATION SO. I THINK THAT

02:16:16.668 --> 02:16:17.235
THERE IT'S A IT'S A MUCH MORE

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:18.503
COMPLICATED AND NUANCED KIND OF

02:16:18.570 --> 02:16:19.037
PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S

02:16:19.104 --> 02:16:19.638
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID BUT I

02:16:19.704 --> 02:16:20.539
THINK THAT FROM A LEADERSHIP

02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:21.172
DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE I THINK

02:16:21.239 --> 02:16:24.676
THERE'S- ET. SOMEONE CALL WROTE

02:16:24.743 --> 02:16:26.511
IT YOU KNOW MENTIONED THE CODE

02:16:26.578 --> 02:16:28.713
SWITCHING THAT MANY OF US WHO

02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:32.317
ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE TO DO.

02:16:32.384 --> 02:16:34.386
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T JUST WALK IN

02:16:34.452 --> 02:16:35.020
AND JUST ASSUME PEOPLE ARE JUST

02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:36.454
GONNA ACCEPT US THE WAY WE ARE

02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:38.323
IN AND WE'VE LEARNED TO DO THAT

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:40.392
BUT I THINK SOMETIMES. IT'S THE

02:16:40.458 --> 02:16:42.327
DEGREE TO WHICH WE HAVE TO CODE

02:16:42.394 --> 02:16:42.894
SWITCH AND SOMETIMES WE GET

02:16:42.961 --> 02:16:44.796
STUCK IN THIS YOU KNOW HOW TO

02:16:44.863 --> 02:16:48.466
WHITE. HONOR QUITE M. FROM A

02:16:48.533 --> 02:16:49.000
CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE MIGHT

02:16:49.067 --> 02:16:50.835
MIGHT MY IDENTITY AND MY VALUES

02:16:50.902 --> 02:16:52.804
AND STILL BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:54.806
THIS ORGANIZATION THAT EXPECTS

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:58.376
CERTAIN THINGS OF US. AND I

02:16:58.443 --> 02:17:00.345
THINK BEING ABLE TO GO THROUGH

02:17:00.412 --> 02:17:00.912
SOME OF THESE. I'LL CALL IT

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:04.416
CULTURALLY A RIPPLE OF IN

02:17:04.482 --> 02:17:04.983
CULTURALLY SENSITIVE TYPE OF

02:17:05.050 --> 02:17:06.685
LEADERSHIP BALL MINT IS IT NOT

02:17:06.751 --> 02:17:10.355
THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT

02:17:10.422 --> 02:17:16.428
ITSELF IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE

02:17:16.494 --> 02:17:16.995
GROW OR SOLD. AND SO THAT WE

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:22.534
CAN. THIS. HOW TO. OFTENTIMES

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:26.972
AT TAUGHT THINGS IN A CERTAIN

02:17:27.038 --> 02:17:27.606
WAY RIGHT RESPECT ELDERS MEANS.

02:17:27.672 --> 02:17:28.173
AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING IN A

02:17:28.239 --> 02:17:28.773
MEETING BUT SOMETIMES RESPECT

02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:29.374
RESPECT YOUR YOUR BOSS MEANS

02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:29.908
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP AND I

02:17:29.975 --> 02:17:30.408
THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

02:17:30.475 --> 02:17:32.611
TEACHING. EATING CODES WHICH IN

02:17:32.677 --> 02:17:33.278
A WAY THAT ENABLES YOU TO HONOR

02:17:33.345 --> 02:17:34.512
WHO YOU ARE BUT ALSO STILL BE

02:17:34.579 --> 02:17:36.848
ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:38.483
ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE IN AND

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:39.050
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:17:39.117 --> 02:17:40.785
TRYING TO DO. I WILL ALSO MAKE

02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:44.456
ONE OTHER COMMENT I THINK ALSO

02:17:44.522 --> 02:17:46.658
THERE'S A CHALLENGE FOR ASIAN

02:17:46.725 --> 02:17:48.360
AMERICANS WHO ARE IN LEADERSHIP

02:17:48.426 --> 02:17:50.495
WHO DO NOT. HELP OTHERS.

02:17:50.562 --> 02:17:52.864
PULLING THEM UP BECAUSE IT'S SO

02:17:52.931 --> 02:17:54.866
SELF CONSCIOUS AND SO AFRAID OF

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:56.701
GETTING ACCUSED OF FAVORING OH

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:58.770
MY GOD GOD FORBID THAT THEY

02:17:58.837 --> 02:18:00.438
HAVE TO HELP ANOTHER ASIAN

02:18:00.505 --> 02:18:02.540
PERSON. THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:18:02.607 --> 02:18:04.643
THEY WILL NOT HELP OTHERS AT

02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:06.544
ALL BUT NOBODY LIKE PETTY

02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:08.446
TALKED ABOUT NOBODY QUESTIONS

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:09.080
WHEN PEOPLE PULL UP. YOU KNOW

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:10.715
WHEN WHITE GUYS PULL UP JUNIOR

02:18:10.782 --> 02:18:12.751
WHITE MEN. AND NOBODY EVER

02:18:12.817 --> 02:18:14.986
QUESTIONS THAT AND THAT'S ALSO

02:18:15.053 --> 02:18:18.657
AN ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO. I

02:18:18.723 --> 02:18:19.290
WOULD ALSO OFFER THAT THIS IS

02:18:19.357 --> 02:18:20.592
PART OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE

02:18:20.659 --> 02:18:21.192
NEED TO HAVE TO HAVE WITH THE

02:18:21.259 --> 02:18:22.861
LARGER COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS

02:18:22.927 --> 02:18:24.863
THE KIND OF DISCUSSION I WOULD

02:18:24.929 --> 02:18:26.665
LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE AT

02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:28.667
THE SUMMIT THAT IF WE CAN

02:18:28.733 --> 02:18:30.902
ORGANIZE IT. BECAUSE I THINK IS

02:18:30.969 --> 02:18:32.570
A MULTI PART CONVERSATION

02:18:32.637 --> 02:18:34.873
HAVING ASIANS DEVELOP THEIR OWN

02:18:34.939 --> 02:18:36.708
LEADERSHIP STYLES AND GROWING

02:18:36.775 --> 02:18:38.643
THERE YOURS IS ONE THING BUT

02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:40.679
WHEN THEY GO BACK OUTSIDE THAT

02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:41.279
LEADERSHIP TRAINING INTO THE

02:18:41.346 --> 02:18:41.746
REGULAR WORKFORCE ARE

02:18:41.813 --> 02:18:42.814
CONFRONTED WITH ALL THESE

02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:44.716
DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS ABOUT WHO

02:18:44.783 --> 02:18:46.551
THEY ARE. AND OUR OWN

02:18:46.618 --> 02:18:48.620
PERCEPTIONS ABOUT WHO THEY ARE

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:49.187
AS WELL AND THAT THE MORE

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:50.989
GLOBAL SOCIETY SO I THINK THIS

02:18:51.056 --> 02:18:54.759
IS A- TWO PART CONVERSATION I

02:18:54.826 --> 02:18:58.563
