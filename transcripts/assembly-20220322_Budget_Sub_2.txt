BEGIN AT TODAY'S HEARING THIS NEW COMMITTEE ROOM ANY DAY OVER HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL SWING SPACE A TODAY WERE HEARING THE ASSEMBLY. BUDGET COMMUNITY EDUCATION FINANCE- A VARIETY OF ISSUES LATEST STUDENT CAREER COLLEGE READINESS EDUCATOR PIPELINE AND THE INTER AGENCY DATA OVERSIGHT WELL THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSALS- WE WILL HEAR FROM PEOPLE IN PERSON AND- YOUR WEBEX TODAY- THE FIRST TWO ISSUES. ARE RELATED TO- THE EDUCATOR PIPELINE IN SHORTAGE AND THEN WE'LL GET INTO ISSUE NUMBER THREE RELATE TO THE EDUCATOR PIPELINE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSALS. A SERVER THAT- WE WILL BEGIN OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT SINCE THE PANDEMIC- TEACHERS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WEGET ITS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM AND LEARNING AND WE DO HAVE A SHORTAGE ACROSS. OUR STATE AND FRANKLY OUR NATIO REPLACING THAT RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO OUR OWN. SEXY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND TEACHERS ON LABOR ISSUES- RELATE TO OF COURSE COMPENSATION AS ALWAYS BUT- THE EDUCATOR WORK FORCE SHORTAGE WHICH I'M- WE KNOW IS SECURED RIGHT HERE IN MY HOMETOWN OF SACRAMENTO BUT ALSO ACROSS THE STATE. SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE AND BRING UP THE FIRST PANEL WE HAVE THE L. A. O. YOUR IN PERSON AND EVERYBODY ELSE I BELIEVE IS PARTICIPATING VIA. WEBEX. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BIRDS ANNUALLY WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO THIS MORNING I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATOR WORKFORCE CAPACITY AND ASSOCIATED RECOMMENDATIONS. I WILL PLAN TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHAT THE TEACHER PIPELINE LOOKS LIKE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THEN GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW THINGS MAY HAVE CHANGED SUBSEQUENTLY. SO PART OF THE PANDEMIC I THINK WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE CHRONIC AREAS OF TEACHER SHORTAGE THAT WE HAD IN THE STATE THAT WERE SUBJECT SPECIFIC AND AFFECTED CERTAIN SCHOOLS MORE. SO IN TERMS OF SUBJECTS WE KNOW THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION THE STEM FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND MATH AND BILINGUAL EDUCATION WERE MORE LIKELY CHALLENGING TO STAFFORD DISTRICTS. IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC SCHOOLS ARMORED AFFECTED LOW INCOME URBAN SCHOOLS AS WELL AS RULES SCHOOLS HAVE THE MOST CHALLENGES RECRUITING AND RETAINING TEACHERS. NOT TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED AND- THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA HAS UNDERGONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF STRAIN AND STRESS THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHERE DO WE STAND NOW. THE FIRST YET THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR THIS QUESTION AND NO SATISFACTORY ANSWERS YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF MEDIA REPORTS AND TALKING TO THE TEACHERS THAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH WE KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF. A PANDEMIC RELATED WORK STRESS- BUT I THINK WILL ALSO GO THROUGH. SOME PIECES OF DATA TODAY THAT KIND OF SUGGESTS THAT. CONCERNS ABOUT MASSIVE ACCIDENTS OUT OF THE TEACHER WORKFORCE MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GROUNDED IN THE DATA THAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW. SO AND TO SORT OF INFORMAL CONVERSATION I WANT TO DISCUSS SOME FACTORS THAT MAY BE DRIVING UP DEMAND FOR TEACHERS AS WELL AS DRIVING DOWN DEMAND AND THEN WE'LL DISCUSS SOME INDICATORS THAT WE USUALLY LOOK AT WHEN. GAUGING I TEACHER SUPPLY AND DEMAND. SO FIRST ON FACTORS DRIVING DEMAND- THEIR TWO KEY FACTORS THAT I WANT TO DISCUSS TODAY. THE FIRST IS WE KNOW THAT KUBICA CELEBRATED SOME TEACHERS LEAVING THE WORK FORCE EARLY I THINK THIS FALLS INTO GROUPS SO FIRST TO TEACHERS THAT LEAVE THE PROFESSION EARLY. BEFORE RETIREMENT AND THEN SECOND IS. COMMENTS SO AGAIN A LOT OF STE WORKING CONDITIONS A LOT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS BURN MAY HAVE CAUSED A LOT OF TEACHERS TO JUST WANT TO LEAVE I'M LOOKING FIRST AT THE PERFECT TEACHERS THAT LEFT THE PROFESSION EARLY SO THAT THE STATE DOESN'T REALLY COLLECTED DATA ON TEACHERS THAT LEAVE THE WORK FORCE EARLY SO IT'S A BIT UNCLEAR AT IN TERMS OF THIS AREA BUT THERE IS A RECENT SURVEY DATA FROM JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT REPORTS THAT THERE IS A MORE LIKELY TO LEAVE THEIR CURRENT JOB DUE TO PANDEMIC RELATED STRESS THAT IN TYPICAL YEARS- ADDITIONALLY THERE'S ALSO FEDERAL DATA THAT. IT COLLECTS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND RATES OF INDIVIDUALS LEAVING CERTAIN INDUSTRIES WE KNOW THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION ACTUALLY HAS ON THE LOWER END OF QUICK RATES COMPARED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES AND SO THAT SORT OF HELPS SET THE GROUND SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT- TEACHERS LEAVING AND IN THESE TWO PIECES I THINK THERE'S KIND OF MIXED EVIDENCE THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TEACHER RETIREMENT DATE AT SO LAST YEAR- THE CALIFORNIA AS SEATED TEACHER A PENSION SYSTEM CAL STIRS RELEASED A BLOG POST THAT SUGGESTED THAT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE SAW A 26% INCREASE IN TEACHERS RETIRING IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. BECAUSE A FAIR AMOUNT OF CONCERN WE SINCE CHECKED IN WITH POSTERS AND IT SOUND AND IT LOOKS LIKE A TEACHER RETIREMENTS WERE UP 8% AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE OVER PAST YEARS- WE INTERPRET THE EARLIER DATA- OF 26% AS MANY TEACHERS WERE PLANNING TO RETIRE LATER ON IN THE YEAR INSTEAD DID SO DURING THE YEAR MOST LIKELY RETIRING WAS A LITTLE BIT EASIER THAN DEALING WITH THE LOGISTICS OF DISTANCE LEARNING AND ASSOCIATED CHALLENGES- THE EARLY TRANSFER TWENTY TWENTY ONE- TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YOU ARE ON TRACK WITH PRIOR TRENDS- SO AGAIN TEACHER RETIREMENT DATA WAS HER. ACTED BUT NOTHING TO INDICATE MASSIVE AT CONCERNING CRISIS LEVELS AT THIS POINT. THE SECOND FACTOR I WANTED DISCUSSING OF DRY UP TO ME. IS A PROGRAM EXT. SO WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED IN THE SUB COMMITTEE THAT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WILL BE EXPANDED IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND DISTRICTS WILL BE EXPECTED TO HIRE NEW TEACHERS. WITH LOWER CLASS SIZES AND THAT CREATES A DEMAND FOR MORE TEACHERS AND ADDITIONALLY THERE MIGHT BE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT PUT STRESS ON THIS TEACHER SUPPLY FOR EXAMPLE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUT JANUARY BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR LITERACY COACHES SOME OF THESE LITERACY COACHES MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEACHER CLASSROOM TEACHERS. AND SO THAT MIGHT ALSO DRIVE UP DEMAND FOR MORE TEACHERS. I'M NEXT MOVING ON TWO FACTORS THAT MIGHT REDUCE DEMAND I'M SO THEIR TWO FACTORS THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. BRIEFLY HERE THE FIRST IS DECLINING ENROLLMENT- OBVIOUSLY THIS TREND PREDATES KOBE BUT DURING COVE IT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE SEEN AN ACCELERATION OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT TRENDS. THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES ARE THESE SHORT TERM TRENDS THAT ARE LIKELY TO REBOUND IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AS WE SEE. MORE STUDENTS COMING BACK INTO PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. OR ARE THERE GOING TO BE LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL IMPACTS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT WERE NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR ABOUT YET- AS DATA BECOMES MORE AVAILABLE WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITORING THIS ADD TO SPECIFIC FACTOR. I'M THE SECOND FACTOR IN TERMS OF REDUCING DEMAND MIGHT JUST BE BETTER MANAGEMENT OF CODEPENDENT MAKE STATE WIDE- IDEALLY AS- I SAID SCHOOLS. UNDERSTAND HOW TO HANDLE CASES AND OPERATES A LITTLE BIT MORE. THAT SHOULD HELP ALLEVIATE SOME TEACHER STRESS RELATED TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS AND- HOPEFULLY- KIND OF ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS ABOUT LEAVING THE PROFESSION PROFESSION EARLY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. NO NEXT MOVE INTO INDICATORS OF THE TEACHER MARKET AND THEY'RE TO DATE INDICATORS THAT WE USUALLY LOOK AT HERE. THE FIRST IS ESTIMATED TO TEACHER HIRES VERSES NEWLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. SO ESTIMATED TEACHER HIRES THIS IS WHAT DISTRICTS REPORT TO CDP ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN TERMS OF. HOW MANY VACANCIES AND NEW TEACHING POSITIONS THEY EXPECT IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR- THIS IS USUALLY AN INDICATOR OF DEMAND. IDEALLY THIS REFLECTS FACTORS SUCH AS TEACHER RETIREMENTS CHANGES IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT DEMAND IN DIFFERENT SUBJECT AREAS AND SO ON. THAT WHEN WE MATCH. THE DATA FOR DEMAND ESTIMATED HIRES WITH SUPPLY FROM NEWLY CREDENTIALED YOU'RE- A CRITIC NEW ISSUE CREDENTIALS FROM CDC FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE DO SEE A CONVERGENCE OF TRENDS WITH ESTIMATED HIGHER IS DECREASING AND NEWLY ISSUED CREDENTIALS INCREASING. SO THIS DATA ACTUALLY COULD SUGGEST THAT THE GAP BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS. ACTUALLY NEARING IN RECENT YEARS. I'M THE NEXT DATA INDICATOR THAT WE LOOK AT IS EMERGENCY CURRENT- PREMIERLEAGUE. THE OF WEAVERS AND PERMITS AS IT SHARE OF TOTAL WORK FORCE WHEN IT DISTRICTS CANNOT HIRE FULLY PREPARE TEACHERS FOR OPENINGS THE USUALLY REQUEST EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS FROM CDC. THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS ISSUED ACTUALLY DROPPED BY 27% BETWEEN NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOWEVER THIS MAY NOT BE REFLECTIVE OF ACTUAL DEMAND GIVEN THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY AND HECTIC SCHOOL YEAR AND- ALL SCHOOLS ARE STILL IN DISTANCE LEARNING. LASTLY SHORT OF ANY DATA WE DO HAVE AN ADULT DAUGHTER REPORTS I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE OF AT THIS POINT. I SCHOOLS HAVE REPORTED WIDESPREAD STAFFING SHORTAGES AND VACANCIES IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SOME TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. HAVE REPORTED INCREASES IN PROGRAM ENROLLMENT- SO WHAT I THINK THAT'S JUST A QUICK RUN THROUGH OF THE DATA INDICATORS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE AT THIS POINT I THINK THE KEY TAKE AWAY HERE IS THAT. THE DATA WE HAVE AVAILABLE NOW DOESN'T SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A MAJOR TEACHER SHORTAGE CRISIS BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE FULL PICTURE GATT AND IT'S- HARD TO TELL WHAT IMPACT CORBETT HAD AND WILL HAVE ON THE TEACHER MARKET- I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION. AS MORE DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE. IN TERMS OF RECOMMENDATIONS- WE MENTION IN OUR EDUCATOR WORKFORCE ANALYSIS THAT IT MIGHT BENEFIT THE STATE TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS IN CASE THERE IS A LARGER DEMAND FOR TEACHERS THAN SUPPLY. IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO CODE IT I'M THE STATE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF CHANGING TEACHER RECRUITMENT APPROACHES EVERY FEW YEARS. AND WENT ACTUALLY A FEW YEARS WITHOUT ANY STATEWIDE TEACHER RECRUITMENT INITIATIVES BEFORE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE AT SO THE STATE CAN SWITCH BETWEEN TARGETED RECRUITMENT FOR THE CHRONIC SHORTAGE AREAS AND LARGE SCALE EFFORTS SUCH AS POST KOBE. MIGHT BENEFIT THE STATE AND WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY- TESTIMONY. BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU COME BACK TO YOU NEXT WE HAVE. MERRY SANDY WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MERRY BIXI SANDY AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING I'M JOINED TODAY BY TWO MEMBERS OF MY TEAM WHO WILL HOPEFULLY HELP I ANSWER QUESTIONS A LITTLE BIT LOOK AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. STAFFING SHORTAGES HAVE BEEN ONGOING OF FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT WORSENED DURING THE PANDEMIC THE COMMISSION'S ANNUAL TEACHER SUPPLY REPORT WILL BE RELEASED THIS FRIDAY WITH A FIVE YEAR DATA THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE CREDENTIAL APPLICATION VOLUME SHRINK OVERALL BY ALMOST 11% ACROSS ALL CREDENTIAL AREAS. DESPITE THIS OVERALL DOWNTURN HOWEVER PRELIMINARY TEACHING IN SERVICES CREDENTIALS ISSUED LAST YEAR REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF ABOUT NUMBER OF EMERGENCY PERMITS ISSUED DECREASED BY ALMOST HALF IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH COULD BE DUE TO THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF FULLY PREPARED AND CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AS WELL AS THE REDUCED NEED FOR EMERGENCY PERMIT HOLDERS. DURING THE CALL WITH YEAR OF SCHOOL CLOSURES. I THINK IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A TREND- THE VOLATILITY OF STAFFING DURING THE KOBE PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT THAN EVER TO MAKE PREDICTIONS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES FOUR POSITIONS FOR THE COMMISSION TO SUPPORT DATA GATHERING RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS OF TEACHER ASSIGNMENT CALIFORNIA'S PK TWELVE EDUCATION WORKFORCE TRENDS AND TEACHER GRANT PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO PARTICIPATION IN THE CRADLE TO CAREER SYSTEM. IT IS OUR HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT THE SUPPORT WILL ENABLE THE COMMISSION TO PROVIDE GREATER INSIGHT INTO THE EMPLOYMENT RETENTION MOBILITY AND ATTRITION OF EDUCATORS IN THE COMING YEARS. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT OVER SEVERAL YEARS ABOUT HALF OF THE NEW TEACHING CREDENTIALS AND PERMITS ISSUED ANNUALLY BY THE COMMISSION HAVE BEEN FOR EMERGENCY PERMITS AND WAIVERS AND INTERNS AND THE OTHER HALF TO FULLY. PREPARED AND CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. THE SITUATION IS WORSE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WE'RE ONLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE CREDENTIALING DOCUMENTS ISSUED GO TO FULLY PREPARE TEACHERS. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS IS PREPARING A CREDENTIALING AND FOCUS MORE INTENTIONALLY INTENSELY ON THE RETENTION OF THE TEACHERS WE HAVE IN THE CLASSROOM. IN ORDER TO TURN THE CHRONIC PROBLEM WITH TEACHER SHORTAGES AROUND. WE ALSO NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE COMPLETION PATTERNS OF CANDIDATES AND ROLLING IN TEACHER EDUCATION. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. TWENTY NINETEEN IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR JUST UNDER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CANDIDATES WERE ENROLLED IN TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS AND JUST OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM COMPLETED THEIR PROGRAMS. AND- TEACHING CREDENTIALS THAT YEAR. CSU IN ROLE JUST OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND CANDIDATES IN TEACHER PREPARATION AND RECOMMENDED JUST OVER SIXTY THREE HUNDRED TEACHERS FOR CREDENTIALS THAT YEAR. THE NUMBERS ARE SMALLER AND CLOSER IN THE UC SYSTEM WITH ENROLLMENT JUST UNDER A THOUSAND CANDIDATES IN CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED CANDIDATES RECOMMENDED FOR A TEACHING CREDENTIAL. IN THE PRIVATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES JUST OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND CANDIDATES WERE ENROLLED THAT YEAR AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND WENT ON TO EARN A CREDENTIAL. MANY OF THESE CANDIDATES MAY BE ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS THAT TAKE LONGER THAN ONE YEAR TO COMPLETE FULL TIME AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO CONSIDER. MAYBE MAY ALSO BE ATTENDING PART TIME AND SOMEBODY OF DETERMINES THE TEACHING IS NOT FOR THEM. IF MORTARBOARD CANDIDATES COMPLETED PREPARATION AND- CREDENTIALS HOWEVER WE COULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHO POTENTIAL ANNUAL IN. THE NEXT THREE SPEAKERS ON THE PANEL MAY HAVE GREATER INSIGHT INTO THE ISSUES THAT IMPACT RETENTION AND COMPLETION. PROGRAMS LIKE THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT AND THE RESIDENCY GRANT PROGRAM PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR CANDIDATES SEEKING TO COMPLETE PROGRAMS AND MOVE INTO TEACHING. ENABLING MORE TO WORK AT IT FULL TIME AND IDEALLY FINISH EARLIER SO THEY CAN MOVE INTO TEACHING. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES IMPORTANT TARGETED FUNDING IT WILL COMPLEMENT INVESTMENTS MADE IN PRIOR YEARS TO SUPPORT AND DEVELOP THE TEACHING WORKFORCE. I'M SO THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT- I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU I CERTAINLY WILL COME BACK TO YOU AT NEXT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM CSU. GOOD MORNING IT IS AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS TEACHER PREPARATION WITH YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS DECLINE AND I AM THE INTERIM ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR EDUCATION PREPARATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAMS HERE AT THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THIS IS YOUR IS TWENTY TWO CAMPUSES WITH TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THE GREAT THINGS WE ARE DOING. OUR CAMPUSES ARE GEARING UP FOR THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS ARE INTEGRATED PROGRAMS ARE GROWING AND MANY CAMPUSES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANTS TO CREATE PROGRAMS. THE CALIPHATE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY ENROLLING APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND TEACHER CANDIDATES PER YEAR MULTIPLE SUBJECTS SINGLE SUBJECT AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS ENROLLMENTS HAVE BEEN STEADILY INCREASING FROM APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CANDIDATES FIVE YEARS AGO TO APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND. THIS YEAR WE PREPARE A LITTLE UNDER HALF THE TEACHERS OF THE STATE. WITH EVERY INCREMENTAL A MOMENT GROWTH FIRST PROVIDED BY THE STATE THEN DIVIDED THAT THEN DECIDED BY EACH CAMPUS LEADERSHIP TEAM MOST PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INCOMING CANDIDATES. EIGHTEEN CAMPUSES ACCOMMODATED ALL ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ACADEMIC YEAR. SOME CAMPUSES THAT REPORTED THEY COULD ACCOMMODATE ALL CANDIDATES ARE REACHING CAPACITY AN APPOINTMENT THEY WILL NEED TO ADD STAFF AND FACULTY IN ORDER TO KEEP ADMITTING ALL QUALIFIED CANDIDATES. FOR OF OUR CAMPUSES MONTEREY BAY NORTHRIDGE SAN JOSE AND SACRAMENTO COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE ALL ELIGIBLE CANDIDATES. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TURNED AWAY WENT FROM A HIGH OF TWENTY TO ALLOW A HIGH OF TWO HUNDRED. TO A LOW OF TWENTY OF THE FOUR CAMPUSES THE REASONS VERY FROM CHANGES AN ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS THAT ENABLE STUDENTS TO BE ADMITTED WITHOUT HAVING TO PASS A NUMBER OF STANDARDIZED TESTS. LARGER THAN ANTICIPATED GROUP INTEGRATED PATHWAYS CANDIDATES CSU RESOURCE LIMITATIONS TRADEOFFS BETWEEN ACADEMIC PROGRAMS NEED TO INCREASE STAFF SUPPORTS FOR LONG TERM GROWTH. ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES IN THE PROGRAM ALL OF OUR- CAMPUS PROGRAMS NEEDS TO STAND RESOURCES FOR STAFF HELP. WITH MEETING ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR BECOMING A TEACHER INCLUDING STATE TEACHING SO. STAFF FOR ADVICE CANNOT RECORD. AND WITH VERIFYING BASIC SKILLS AND SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCY. HOW CAN THE STATE HELP WE BELIEVE THE STATE IS ALREADY WELL DOWN THE ROAD IN HELPING BY COMMITTING TO GROW ENROLLMENT AT THE CSU THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNMENT COMMITTED LAST YEAR TO GO ON ROMIT BY. OVER NINE THOUSAND F. TES IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FUNDING FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THAT WOULD SUPPORT THAT ENROLLMENT GROWTH COMMITMENT I WOULD THE FOUR CAMPUSES I MENTIONED THAT COULD GROW THEIR TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS THIS ISSUE HAS ALREADY COMMITTED TO PASS ALONG TO THOSE CAMPUSES ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING IF INDEED THAT FUNDING IS INCLUDED IN THE FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT THE SUMMER. THIS WOULD IMPROVE THE PROSPECTS OF THOSE FOUR CAMPUSES UNDER DISTRICT LEADERSHIP TEAMS AND POTENTIALLY EXPANDING THOSE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS TO MEET PROSPECTIVE STUDENT DEMAND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE A LITTLE ON THE CSU TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS AND I AM WILLING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU NEXT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. YES HI GOOD MORNING JERRY MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CLAUDIA MARTINEZ AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATOR PROGRAMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. I'M I'M ALSO JOINED THIS MORNING BY MY COLLEAGUE DR ANNA MARIE FRANCE LAW WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CENTER EXIT UCLA. AND THE UC REPRESENTATIVE ON THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSIN ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING WHO IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING. ABOUT THE UC'S ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE PREPARATION OF EDUCATORS AND SCHOOL LEADERS. THE RECRUITMENT PREPARATION AND RETENTION OF HIGH QUALITY EDUCATORS HAS ONLY BEEN MADE MORE URGENT AS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. CONTINUE TO BE TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGED BY THE EFFECTS OF THE CODE PANDEMIC CRISIS AND ITS MANY ONGOING DISRUPTIONS TO TEACHING AND LEARNING. THE UC HAS A LONG TRADITION OF PRODUCING EDUCATIONAL LEADERS FOR OUR STATE AND THE WORK OF EDUCATOR PREPARATION OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FOR TEACHERS AS ONE THAT ALIGNS SQUARELY. WITH THE UC'S MISSION OF RESEARCH TEACHING AND SERVICE. OUR EDUCATOR PROGRAMS RECRUIT PREPARING SUPPORT PRE SERVICE AND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS AND SCHOOL SITE LEADERS. WHO ARE COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE EQUITY AND ARE DEDICATED TO MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE STUDENTS. THIS WORK AND EDUCATE UC'S EDUCATOR PROGRAMS IS ORGANIZED ORGANIZED ALONG A CONTINUUM THAT BEGINS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL THROUGH CREDENTIALING THROUGH DOCTORAL TRAINING INTO LIFELONG PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. AT THE UNDERGRADUATE PREPARATION LEVELER CAL TEACH PROGRAM WHICH HELPS TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE IN THE SUPPLY WELL QUALIFIED K. TWELVE MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE TEACHERS. MY SUCCESSFULLY RECRUITING PREPARING AND MOTOR INTELLIGENT UNDERGRADUATE STEM MAJORS TO PURSUE CAREERS AS EDUCATORS. ON TODAY THE CAL TEACHPROGRAMS PREPARED SIX HUNDRED MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS. AND NOTABLY ONE OUT OF FOUR SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIALS AND STEM FIELDS WERE AWARDED IN CALIFORNIA WERE AWARDED IN CALIFORNIA. WAS AWARDED TO A CAL TEACH GRADUATE. AT THE POST. SKEWS ME AT THE- BACCALAUREATE ARE. TEACHER AT. PROGRAMS AND TO PRINCIPALLY TO SHIP INSTITUTES PREPARE NEARLY A THOUSAND TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND APPRXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE ADMINISTRATOR CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES PER YEAR. AND FOR IN SERVICE TEACHERS THE CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT THE STATE'S INTERSECT METAL NETWORK OF TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SUPPORTS OVER THIRTY THOUSAND K. TWELVE EDUCATORS ANNUALLY. BY CULTIVATING STRONG CLASSROOM LEADERSHIP SKILLS PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY DISCIPLINE BASED PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORKS WHILE MAINTAINING LONG TERM COLLABORATIONS WITH UNIVERSITY FACULTY FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. IN ADDITION TO THE PREPARATION OF TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS YOU SEE IS ALSO ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN DOCTORAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH YOU SEE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE PREPARATION OF EDUCATION FACULTY AND TEACHER EDUCATION SCHOLARS BY WAY OF ITS DOCTORAL PROGRAMS. MANY OF THESE GRADUATES EVENTUALLY BECOME FACULTY AND TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS NOT ONLY AT UC CAMPUSES IN A DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE CSU AND ELSEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND LASTLY YOU SEE CONDUCTS RIGOROUS RESEARCH AND TEACHER EDUCATION DEVELOPING PROGRAMS AND BEST PRACTICES FOR EDUCATORS AND THEN IS ABLE TO RESEARCH THE EFFECTIVENESS AND PRACTICAL SCHOOL BASED SETTINGS. HOW WAS YOU SEE RESPONDING TO THE CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LANDSCAPE FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN INNOVATING AND MODIFYING OUR TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND CURRICULUM IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE PREPARATION TEACHERS NEED TO TEACH EFFECTIVELY IN A POST COLD IN ERA AND RESPOND TO THE EDUCATIONAL INEQUITIES THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. BY SOCIETAL RECKONING AROUND PROFOUND RACIAL AND SOCIAL INJUSTICES YOU SEE TEEPEES ARE EXPANDING ACCESS TO TEACHER RESIDENCIES ACROSS THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM AT UCLA RECRUITS ARE PREPARES ASPIRING TEACHERS DISTURBANCE STEM COMPUTER SCIENCE AND BILINGUAL CLASSROOMS ALL AREAS OF HIGH NEED AND STATE. NOTABLY THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT ATTRACTING IN GRADUATING HIGH PERCENTAGES OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES AND OTHER TEACHERS OF COLOR. UC'S PRINCIPLE LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT IS DESIGNING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES THEY WILL NEED. ON TO STRENGTHEN THEIR EFFECTIVENESS THIS IS THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CALIFORNIA STATE LEADERSHIP ACADEMY STATE CENTER WHICH IS A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE OF. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER HAS ENGAGED. IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CAL COLLABORATIVE FOR. EXCELLENCE TO CREATE INNOVATIVE ONLINE RESOURCES AND TOOLS THE SCIENTISTS PROVIDE CONTENT AND PEDAGOGICAL SUPPORT- INCLUDING THOSE FOR SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STATE AND OUR HIGHER EDUCATION AND K. TWELVE PARTNERS TO HELP CALIFORNIA DEVELOP A STATE WIDE SUSTAINABLE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE OF TEACHER PREPARATION THAT WILL MITIGATE CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATOR SHORTAGE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURING TEACHER QUALITY. AT THIS TIME INCREASING THE INVOLVEMENT OF OUR TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS AT ALL POINTS ALONG THE CONTINUUM A TEACHER PROFESSION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS LIMITED ONLY BY THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES. ON AN ONGOING RESOURCES FOR TWO CRITICAL PURPOSES FIRST FUNDING IS NEEDED TO RECRUIT AND SUPPORT APPLICANTS FROM LOW INCOME RURAL AND OTHER UNDERSERVED REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND SECOND FUNDING IS NEEDED TO HIRE THE FACULTY AND STAFF NECESSARY TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL STUDENTS IN HIGH NEED SUBJECT MATTER AREAS- SEWING. UC'S TEACHER EDUCATION INITIATIVES ARE RESEARCH BASED AND CLINICALLY ROBUST THEY'RE GROUNDED IN THE BELIEF THAT EDUCATED DIVERSITY QUALITY AND RETENTION DEPENDS ON THE CULTIVATION OF AN ECOSYSTEM OF HIGH QUALITY. TEACHER PREPARATION OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DOCTORAL PREPARATION AND RESEARCH RECRUITING PREPARING AND RETAINING A DIVERSE QUALIFIED WORK FORCE OF EDUCATORS TO TEACH AND LEADING CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS IS CRITICAL TO OUR STATE'S FUTURE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS FOR ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY TEACHERS THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU I WILL CERTAINLY COME BACK TO YOU LASTLY WE HAVE. A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE. GOOD MORNING I'M DESIREE CARVER THOMAS I'M A RESEARCHER AND POLICY ANALYST AT LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE AND I STUDY TEACHERS APPLYING BUT IN DEMAND BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY- TODAY I'M SHARING RESULTS FROM OUR MOST RECENT STUDY TEACHER SHORTAGES DURING THE PANDEMIC HOW CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS ARE RESPONDING. I JUST CAME OUT IN JANUARY AND BUILT UPON FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A PREVIOUS TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT WHICH IS REFERENCED IN THE HEARING AGENDA. BUT FIRST WHY DO TEACHER SHORTAGES MATTER TEACHER SHORTAGES IMPACT STUDENT LEARNING HAVING MORE FULLY PREPARED TEACHERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER STUDENT OUTCOMES ESPECIALLY FOR BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS UNDERPREPARED TEACHERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO TURN OVER NEW RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 42% OF CALIFORNIA TEACHERS WHO BEGAN TEACHING ON EMERGENCY STYLE. PERMITS LEFT WITHIN THREE YEARS THIS CREATES CHAU. HAS FINANCIAL COSTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTS STUDENT LEARNING. FINALLY TEACHER SHORTAGES ARE KEY DRIVER UP EDUCATIONAL INEQUITY STUDENTS OF COLOR AND FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF SHORTAGES. THE NUMBER OF SUBSTANDARD CREDENTIALS IN PERMITS TRIPLED BETWEEN TWENTY TWELVE THIRTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I THESE CAN ONLY BE ISSUED AS AS MENTIONED BEFORE I WANT TO FULLY CREDENTIALED TEACHER IS NOT AVAILABLE MAKING THEM A KEY INDICATOR OF SHORTAGES. EMERGENCY STYLE PERMITS AND WAIVERS ISSUED TO ARE LEAST PREPARED TEACHERS HAVE GROWN SEVEN FOLD THESE NUMBERS TELL US THAT SHORTAGES HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT AND GROWING AND THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE LEAST PREPARATION ARE INCREASING IN NUMBER AT THE VERY FASTEST RATES IN SOME. AT THE TEACHER SHORTAGE WAS ALREADY A DIRE SITUATION BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE DECIDED TO LEARN HOW CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS WERE EXPERIENCING RETIREMENTS RESIGNATIONS VACANCIES AND HIRING DURING THE PANDEMIC IN SUMMER TWENTY ONE WE SURVEYED DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS FROM TWELVE DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING EIGHT. OF THE LARGEST AND FOR SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS. AS WE KNOW THAT THEIR CHALLENGES CAN BE DISTINCT IN TOTAL THESE. ARE ONE ANSWER CAL STUDENTS. COMPARED TO PRE COPING YEARS WE FOUND THE DISTRICTS HAD MORE TEACHER VACANCIES BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR AND THOSE VACANCIES WERE HARDER TO FILL. WE FOUND TWO PRIMARY REASONS FOR THIS FIRST MANY DISTRICTS ATTRIBUTED HIGHER VACANCY RATES TO INCREASE RETIREMENTS OR RESIGNATIONS OVER PRE COOK YEARS. IN ONE LARGE DISTRICT RESIGNATIONS INCREASED BY ABOUT TWO THIRDS THAT'S NEARLY 70% COMPARED TO BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SMALL WORLD DISTRICTS TOLD IS THAT LOSING EVEN ONE TEACHER HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON STAFFING OF COURSE OFFERINGS. THE SECOND REASON DISTRICTS EXPERIENCED GREATER VACANCIES THIS YEAR WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO CREATE ADDITIONAL TEACHING POSITIONS WITH RECOVERY FUNDS THESE POSITIONS WERE CRITICAL TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS COMING BACK TO SCHOOL AFTER. AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF DISRUPTED LEARNING ONE ADMINISTRATOR TOLD US. WE TYPICALLY HIRE AROUND A HUNDRED FORTY EACH YEAR THIS YEAR WE'VE HIRED THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE SO FAR. EVERY DISTRICT IN OUR STUDY HAD HIRED AT LEAST SOME TEACHERS ON SUB STANDARD CREDENTIALS AND PERMITS% WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT POSITIONS TO FILL BEING THOSE CHRONIC SHORTAGE SUBJECTS MATH SCIENCE SPECIAL EDUCATION BILINGUAL EDUCATION. HOWEVER MANY DISTRICTS WERE ALSO WORKING TO MITIGATE THE SHORTAGES FIRST DISTRICTS WERE INCREASING COMPENSATION FOR TEACHERS AND SUBSTITUTES SECOND DISTRICTS FOR INVESTING IN STUDENT SUPPORTS LIKE- HIRING COUNSELORS AND OTHERS OTHER US SUPPORT STAFF FOR STUDENTS- AND ALSO TO EASE THE WORKLOAD ON TEACHERS WE KNOW THAT WORKLOAD. AND STRESS INFLUENCE TEACHERS FEELINGS ABOUT STAYING IN THE PROFESSION. THIRD DISTRICTS REPORTED TAKING ADVANTAGE OF STATE GRANT FUNDS TO CREATE HIGH RETENTION PATHWAYS INTO TEACHING THEY USED A CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE FUNDS AND FUNDS FOR TEACHER RESIDENCIES- DISTRICTS WITH ESTABLISHED RESIDENCY PROGRAMS EXPLAINED THAT THEY HELP THEM NAVIGATE. THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE THEY COULD COUNT ON HAVING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF NEW TEACHERS IN HARD TO STAFF SUBJECTS AND LOCATIONS. FINALLY DISTRICT MITIGATED SHORTAGES BY INCREASING THE RECRUITMENT AND HIRING CAPACITY TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE. IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE HAS TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN OUR PREVIOUS TWENTY TWENTY ONE TEACHER SHORTAGE REPORT DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA FOR THIS HEARING. AND YOU'LL HEAR ON A LATER PANEL JUST LAST YEAR THE STATE INVESTED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN BUILDING THE TEACHER PIPELINE WITH FUNDS FOR TEACHER RESIDENCIES TEACHER SCHOLARSHIPS AND MORE THE STATE HAS ALSO INVESTED IN SUPPORTING THE WORK FORCE WE HAVE WHICH IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. FOR ADDRESSING SHORTAGES THERE ARE INCENTIVES FOR NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHERS AND FUNDS ARE FOR THOSE PURSUING THAT CERTIFICATION THIS WILL HELP BUILD A POOL OF TEACHER MENTORS TO SUPPORT NEW TEACHERS COMING INTO THE FIELD. THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR MOST RECENT JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO REPORT SUGGEST WAYS TO BUILD UPON THESE INVESTMENTS AND STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN WELL PREPARED TEACHERS. ON THE RECRUITMENT SIDE A STATE WIDE RECRUITMENT INITIATIVE IS CRITICAL BECAUSE NAVIGATING THE PROCESS OF BECOMING A TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA CAN BE COMPLEX. AND DAUNTING. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PREPARATION PROGRAMS CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS. TEST SPEEDS. AND MORE IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO LOOK BEYOND PROMOTIONAL OR MARKETING CAMPAIGNS- AND TO REALLY ENSURE THAT THERE ARE TOUCH POINTS FOR CAREER COUNSELING THAT HELP PEOPLE NAVIGATE THE PROCESS AND ADDRESS POTENTIAL BARRIERS. HIGHER ADIPOSITY BUILDING IS ALSO CRUCIAL TEACHER PREP PROGRAMS WILL NEED TO WILL NEED SUPPORT TO ENROLL MORE CANDIDATES IN HIGH DEMAND FIELDS LIKE MATH AND SCIENCE. TO IMPLEMENT THE STATE'S NEW STANDARDS FOR GENERAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND TO PREPARE MORE EARLY EDUCATORS- WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL AS THE STATE WORKS TO CHEAP UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. I THE STATE COULD ESTABLISH CAPACITY BUILDING GRANTS- SYSTEM A SIMILAR PROGRAM FUNDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- AND WAS SUCCESSFU. IN LAUNCHING NEW FOUR YEAR INTEGRATED TEACHER PREP PROGRAMS IN CERTAIN HIGH NEED FIELDS. THE STATE COULD ALSO CONSIDER SUPPORTING TO PUSH TO PROGRAMS THAT MAKE A TEACHER PREP MORE ACCESSIBLE TO CANDIDATES WHO MIGHT NOT ALREADY HAVE. ACCESS TO TEACHER EDUCATION THIS CAN SUPPORT RURAL COMMUNITIES AND CAN HELP WITH TEACHER DIVERSITY. INCREASING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE PREPARATION IN THESE WAYS ALSO A RETENTION STRATEGY TEACHERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO STAY IN THE FIELD. WHEN THEY'VE HAD ROBUST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AND COURSE WORK BEFORE BEGINNING TEACHING. I'M IN ADDITION COMPENSATION MATTERS TEACHER SALARIES ARE LOCALLY BARGAINED BUT THE STATE CAN IMPROVE- TEACHER INCOME BY REDUCING DEBT AND IT DRAFTING HIGH HOUSING COSTS THE STATE HAS TAKEN SOME OF THE STEPS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE GOLDEN STATE PROGRAM. BUT A DIGITAL STEPS COULD BE TAKE- RECENT OR ANTI HOUSE AND HEALTH RECORD PROVIDING FUNDS FOR PLANNING AND CAPITAL COSTS FOR PROJECTS TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FOR SCHOOL STAFF. IN ACCORDING TO THAT REPORT SANTA CLARA UNIFIED HAS HIGH DEMAND FOR ITS HOUSING- AND TEACHERS WHO RECEIVE THIS HOUSING HAVE ATTRITION RATES. TWO THIRDS LOWER THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS WHO DO NOT. FINALLY IMPROVED WORKING CONDITIONS ARE KEY TO RETAINING TEACHERS SEVERAL STATES NORTH CAROLINA KENTUCKY OHIO OREGON AND SO ON ADMINISTER REGULAR. TEACHER TEACHER WORKING CONDITIONS SURVEYS TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS. IMPACTING TEACHER RETENTION IN ORDER TO INFORM IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA COULD CONSIDER A SIMILAR EFFORT. TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- YEAH SO THIS IS AN OVERVIEW OF THAT OF THAT WORK FOR SHORTAGE CRISIS AND THEN ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE ACTIONS FROM THE FROM THE LAST YEAR ON THIS ISSUE AND THEN THREE IS THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSALS SO WE'RE GOING TO HEAR AN ISSUE TO NOW AND THEN HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS ON BOTH THESE TWO ISSUES COMBINED. I ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS THE OVERVIEW. OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO pMAY RELATE TO THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHERS PROGRAM TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES CREDENTIALING PROGRAM. THE FIRST L. A. L. IN CITY THROUGH NAY COMMISSION AND CTC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AMY LEE WITH THE L. A- AGAIN- I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE EDUCATOR PIPELINE PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVED FUNDING AND CURRENT YEAR ALTOGETHER THERE ARE SIX PROGRAMS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT MENTIONED IN YOUR AGENDA ARE THE FIRST THREE ARE DESCRIBED IN THE TOP ROWS OF THE TABLE ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA- AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT THREE I THINK I'LL JUST ADD THIS DESCRIBE EVER PLAY. SO- THE GOLDEN STARTING WITH THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND THIS PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED BY C. SACK AND PROVIDES TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS ENROLLED IN TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS WHO AGREE TO TEACH FOR FOUR YEARS IN HIGH NEED SUBJECT AREAS AT SCHOOLS WHERE ARE THERE ARE MORE THAN ENGLISH LEARNERS. AND TEACHERS ARE WHO ARE UNABLE TO MEET THIS FOR YOUR TEACHING REQUIREMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY BACK A PORTION OF GRANT FUNDS- MOVING ON TO THE TEACHER. GRANT PROGRAM SO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OVER FIVE YEARS. THIS PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED BY CTC- OF YOURS PANELS HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED. ASPECTS OF THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM I'LL JUST MENTION THAT THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF GRANTS GRANTS THAT ARE PROVIDED FIRST- PLANNING GRANTS OF UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS ISTO BUILD CAPACITY FOR THE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN ALLEY AS AND HIGHER AT INSTITUTIONS. RUNNING TEACHER PREP PROGRAMS IN THE SECOND- RESIDENCY GRANTS OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER RESIDENT- BUT THAT IS. IN AND ROLLED IN A NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAM- UNDER THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PACKAGE. I LIAISE RECEIVING GRANTS ARE NOW REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AN EIGHTY CENT MATCH FOR EVERY DOLLAR GRANT STE- FUNDING FROM THE STATE. OTHERS ALSO ADDITIONAL PRIORITY GIVEN TO APPLICANTS WHO DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO INCREASING DIVERSITY AND THE TEACHING WORK FIRST. AND HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN OTHER AFRICANS OF UNDUPLICATED PUPILS AND HAVE ONE OR MORE SCHOOLS THAT EXHIBIT ONE OF THE FOLLOWING. AB CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING A SCHOOL WHERE 50% OR MORE OF THE- PEOPLES ARE ENROLLED IN FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH. OR AT A SCHOOL THAT IS EITHER LOCATED IN A RULE OR DENSELY POPULATED AREA. NEXT MOVE ONTO A CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROGRAM. THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT OVER FIVE YEARS. . D. C. A COMPETITIVELY AWARDS THESE GRANTS. ON THESE THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OF GRANTS UP TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PARTICIPATE OVER FIVE YEARS TO CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE OR EMPLOYEES SUCH AS- INSTRUCTIONAL AIDES BUS DRIVERS CAFETERIA WORKERS TO PURSUE THEIR TEACHING CREDENTIAL. IN ADDITION TO EXISTING PROGRAM CRITERIA- THAT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PACKAGE GIVES PRIORITY TO LBJ'S MEETING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING. INCLUDING NOT HAVING PREVIOUSLY ROOF RECEIVED FUNDING HAVING A HIGHER SHARE THAN OTHER APPLICANTS UNDUPLICATED PUPILS AND HAS A PLAN TO ADDRESS STAFFING NEEDS FOR EXPANDED LEARNING PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS KINDERGARTEN AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FOR.

WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING DYSLEXIA ANSWER THAT CONCLUDES THIS OVERVIEW BUT I'M SURE THAT THAT SUCH COMPOUNDS WILL BE PROVIDING PROGRAM UPDATES ASKING FOR EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS THANK YOU. AHEAD WITH THE. WE CAN GO AHEAD WITH THE NEXT PANELISTS PLEASE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CHERYL COTTON DEBBIE SUPERINTENDENT OF IN THE INSTRUCTION MEASUREMENT ADMINISTRATION BRANCH AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'M PRESENTING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT MANY EARLY RETIREMENTS AND RESIGNATIONS FROM TEACHERS WHICH IS INTENSIFIED THE PERSISTENT NATIONAL TEACHER SHORTAGE. TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS HAVE REPORTED HAVING MORE TEACHER VACANCIES AND DIFFICULTIES ATTRACTING NEW TEACHERS THIS YEAR. ADDITIONAL CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR CANDIDATES IN CALIFORNIAINCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL TWO TO THREE SEMESTERS AFTER COMPLETING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. TWO OF THE SEMESTERS MUST BE SPENT DOING UNPAID STUDENT TEACHING. FOR MANY THIS OPTION IS UNREASONABLE FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR SECOND CAREER CANDIDATES THAT MAY HAVE ALREADY THAT MAY ALREADY HAVE HOUSEHOLDS SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA HAS DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS FOR TEACHERS TO EARN TEACHING CREDENTIALS AS WELL AS OTHER FISCAL SUPPORTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ALLEVIATE THE TEACHERS' SUPPORT DID THE TEACHER SHORTAGE. IN PARTICULAR INEFFECTIVE MEANS TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND SMOOTHER TRANSITIONS TO TEACHING IN HIGH NEED SCHOOLS MANY DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE FORMED PARTNERSHIPS WITH TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS WHERE TEACHERS CAN BE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR STUDENT TEACHING THIS ALLOWS THE DISTRICT TO GAIN ACCESS TO NEW TEACHERS ENTERING THE PROFESSION AND HIRE THEM STRAIGHT OUT OF THEIR TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. THE TEACHER CAN'T IS IN TURN ARE ALREADY ACCUSTOMED TO THE DISTRICT PROCEDURES AND POLICIES AND OF ALSO EXPERIENCE WITH STUDENTS IN THE CULTURE OF THE SCHOOL. ASSESSMENTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ENROLLMENT IS STRONG AND TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION-AT 41% IN SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING MATH OR STEM AT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF ENROLLEES ARE HISPANIC OR LATIN NEXT AT 46% AND FEMALE 73% HOWEVER HE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE EMERGED INCLUDING A MAJORITY OF RESIDENTS REPORT EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS DURING THE RESIDENTS HERE AND RESIDENTS OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. MOST RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE OFFERING DISTRICT BASED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO RESIDENTS SUCH AS HAVING THEM SERVICE SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS PARA PROFESSIONALS OUR TUTORS. BUT FEWER THAN HALF OF RESIDENTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THESE OPPORTUNITIES. MOST PROGRAMS ARE NOT YET BROADENING THEIR FUNDING SOURCES AND STRATEGIES TO ENABLE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY BEYOND THE GRANT PROGRAM AND MANY PROGRAMS COULD STRENGTHEN THEIR PARTNERSHIPS WITH PARTNER ELEAZAR AND BUILD INTERNAL CAPACITY TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABILITY. WE KNOW THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD OFF OF THESE EXISTING WORK FORCE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ASSISTING THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE CTC AND OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY ENTITIES. TO ADDRESS THE TEACHER SHORTAGE WITH ME TODAY IS KRISTIN CHRIS ALLEN FROM THE EDUCATOR EXCELLENCE AND EQUITY DIVISION AND WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR NEXT PANELIST JAKE RUNNER. FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION WILL BE JOINING US REMOTELY. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS JAKE REMEMBER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND VERY HAPPY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE- I UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM. WITH THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP OUR STATE ADDRESSED THE TEACHER PIPELINE ISSUES THAT- PRIOR PANELISTS HAVE RAISED AND- TO PROVIDE A PATHWAY FOR ASPIRING EDUCATORS TO EARN A CREDENTIAL. AND THEN GO ON TO SERVE IN OUR SCHOOLS SERVING THE MOST LOW INCOME ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER AND FOSTER YOUTH STUDENTS- ARE L. A. O. COLLEAGUE ALREADY PROVIDED YOU WITH A SHORT A RECAP OF WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES- WHAT I'LL NOTE IS THAT. THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION FROM LAST YEAR'S STATE BUDGET WAS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT BUT BUILT ON TOP OF A PRIOR YEAR INVESTMENT OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT FUNDING. ALLOWED US TO START SERVING STUDENTS WERE ENTERING TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS AND COMMITTED TO SERVING AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER. SO WE'RE IN YEAR ONE STILL OF THIS EXPANDED VERSION OF THE PROPOSAL IT'S TAKEN ON OTHER HIGH PRIORITY SUBJECT AREAS BUT WE ARE HERE TO. OF THE FUNDING FOR IDEATE AND FOR STUDENTS ENTERING SPECIAL EDUCATION. TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. AFTER THE ENACTMENT OF THE BUDGET AND THE APPROPRIATION OF FUNDING THE STUDENT COMMISSION UTILIZED OUR EMERGENCY REGULATORY AUTHORITY THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US IN THE TRAILER BILL TOO QUICKLY DEVELOPING ISSUED GUIDELINES FOR THIS PROGRAM AS WE ARE EXPANDING ITS SCOPE. NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THE- HIGH PRIORITY SUBJECT AREAS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAMMATIC ELIGIBILITY- TO INCLUDE PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. THERE'S NO APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR THIS PROGRAM SO THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION RECEIVED APPLICATIONS ON A ROLLING BASIS SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS AND A WAR- STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND- QUALIFIED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS PROVIDES DATA FROM LAST MONTH ON HOW MANY APPLICATIONS THIS TECHNIQUE COMMISSION HAS RECEIVED SO FAR FOR THIS YEAR. WE'VE RECEIVED EVEN MORE APPLICATIONS FROM THE SPRING TERM AND THE TIME SENSE. SO AS OF THIS WEEK- THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION HAS RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY. THIRTY TWO HUNDRED TOTAL APPLICATIONS- AND WE ANTICIPATE WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A FEW MORE APPLICATIONS- BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THIS YEAR AND AGAIN WE ARE CONTINUING TO PROCESS THOSE APPLICATIONS AND ISSUE CHECKS. ON THAT ULING BASIS. I'M PLEASED TO SHARE- I'M UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE IN EXTENDING HE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED TOWARD THIS PROGRAM I'LL START WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT FUNDING TO IDEATE FUNDING THAT WAS FIRST APPROPRIATED IN THAT TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. AND ACTUALLY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION NOW HAS OR WILL IN THE NEXT WEEK I HAVE EXPENDED ALL OF THAT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATIONS. BILL SPONSORED BEEN AWARDED TO A ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX STUDENTS THAT MADE- THEIR TEACHER COMMITMENT TO ENTER THE SPECIAL EDUCATION SUBJECT OR AREA. AT A HIGH PRIORITY SCHOOL AS DEFINED IN STATUTE SERVING THOSE LARGE NUMBERS OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND FOSTER YOUTH STUDENTS. ON THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION- MADE LAST YEAR- COMMISSION HAS BEEN ASKED TO A WORD TO QUALIFIED STUDENTS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. SO FAR WE HAVE EXPANDED ABOUT SEVENTEEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT APPROPRIATION. WELL THIS IS A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE FUNDS AGAIN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS OVER THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE STILL IN YOUR ONE OF THIS PROGRAM AND WORKING TO STRENGTHEN. MARC OUTREACH PARTNERSHIPS PARTICULARLY AROUND THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. AND MAY NOT BE ADMINISTERED BY AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION ARE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION BUT WHAT PRIORESS TO PARTNER WITH OUR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. SO FAR ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND IT'S BEEN AWARDED TO STUDENTS I'M NOT REPRESENTS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE SOME KIND OF A WAR AND THOSE- CHECKS CONTINUE TO BE ISSUED ON A WEEKLY BASIS. MOVING FORWARD WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO MAKE THE APPLICATION AVAILABLE- FOR THE FUTURE HERE- STARTING ACTUALLY IN JUST A COUPLE WEEKS IN APRIL I'M HOWEVER CURRENT STATUTORY LANGUAGE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO INFORM US YOU CAN THAT THEY'RE AWARDED A GRANT. UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY ENROLL IN THERE A TEACHER CREDENTIAL PROGRAM- THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN AMENDMENT YOUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS WELL AS ARE CURRENTLY APPROVED REGULATIONS. AND WE PROVIDED LANGUAGE TO THE COMMITTEES OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEES AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WOULD ADDRESS. THOSE ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY WE SUGGESTED ANOTHER TECHNICAL MODIFICATION THAT WILL HELP US BETTER SERVE STUDENTS WHO WERE SPEAKING TO US SERVICE EDUCATORS AND BILINGUAL OR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION FIELDS. AS I MENTIONED OUTSIDE OF THE STATURE. CHANGES THAT YOU NEED COMMISSION LOOKING DEEPEN OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH K. TWELVE STAKEHOLDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO BETTER PROMOTE THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE AWARDS AND WHILE WE HAVE EXISTING COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WITH OUR HIGHER EDUCATION PARTNERS IN COLLEGES OF EDUCATION. IF THOSE NEW NEWLY ELIGIBLE ELLIE A PROGRAMS WHERE WE KNOW WE CAN PARTICULARLY- DEEP AND OUR REACH CUTE THE TEACHER STAFFING SHORTAGES AS CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND OTHER PANELISTS NOTED IN THE EARLIER REMARKS SO- WERE OF COURSE A VERY MOTIVATED TO WORK WITH ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED TO HELP. GET THE WORD OUT ACROSS THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE AWARDS A PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL MORE YEARS OR WE CAN EXPAND THESE BONDS AND CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE THIS FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT OUR PANELISTS HAVE MENTIONED AROUND THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AND HARDSHIPS PARTICULARLY DURING THE RESIDENCY PERIOD. SO WITH THAT AT ALL- STOP MY COMMENTS THERE AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU LASTLY WE'LL GO BACK TO THE CTC. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN VERY BIG SEE SANDY WITH COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING THE STATE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATED WORKFORCE INITIATIVES THAT SHOW GREAT PROMISE IN THEIR ABILITY TO DRAW PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS INTO THE PROFESSION AND SUPPORT THEIR PREPARATION FOR CREDENTIAL. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THESE INVESTMENTS ESTABLISHED SIXTY ONE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE CREDENTIALED THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN TEACHERS TO DATE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN OF THEM IN SPECIAL EDUCATION A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE AND STEM THIRTY ONE IN MULTIPLE SUBJECTS IN SEVENTY FIVE IN BILINGUAL EDUCATION. 70% OF THESE RESIDENTS SELF IDENTIFY AS BILINGUAL INDIGENOUS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. INVESTMENTS IN THE CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROGRAM HAS SUPPORTED FIFTY THREE GRANTS YEAH AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SLOTS. ARE AND HAVE LED TO THE ISSUANCE OF 10003100403% NOT PRELIMINARY CREDENTIALS EARNED SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN MORE THAN HALF OF THESE HAVE BEEN IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN STEM AND CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED AND MULTIPLE SUBJECTS AND OVER A HUNDRED IN BILINGUAL EDUCATION. AS WITH RESIDENCIES THIS PROGRAM IS ATTRACTING A MORE DIVERSE POPULATION OF FUTURE TEACHERS WERE EFFECTIVE GROW YOUR OWN LOCAL STRATEGIES. WITH THIS YEAR'S INVESTMENT OF JUST UNDER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR THESE TWO PROGRAMS ARE POISED TO BRING TO BUILD ON THIS EARLY BEGINNING. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FIVE POSITIONS AT THE COMMISSION WHICH WILL ENABLE THE COMMISSION TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE GRANT PROGRAMS. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. COMMISSION IS OFFERING TO SUBMISSION WINDOWS PER YEAR FOR ELEAZAR SEEKING THESE GRANTS AND THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WILL ENABLE US TO ENGAGE WITH THE- YEAH I AM TEACHER PREPARATION COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND EXTEND THE REACH OF THESE PROGRAMS STATEWIDE. WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER ADDITIONAL ONGOING FUNDING IS NEEDED IT MAY BE TOO EARLY TO TELL. SUSTAINING AND PROTECTING THE INVESTMENT IN THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE IMPORTANT HOWEVER IN THE COMING YEARS TO ENSURE STABILITY AND THE HELP THE STATE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED TEACHER SHORTAGES. THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU WE'LL HAVE IT A SERIES OF QUESTIONS NOW FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS BEFORE WE GET TO THE SHOULD NUMBER THREE WHICH IS THE THAT PROPOSAL'S GOING FORWARD I'M A START OFF WITH MR MEDINA AND THEN MISTER O'DONNELL AND ALL THAT MR LEE WITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU TO THE PALACE I THINK THERE PRESENTATION IS- TIMELY AND VERY INFORMATIVE. AND I CANNOT HELP BUT MKE A NOTE THAT IT SEEMS TO ME AS A FORMER TEACHER OF SITTING HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM LONG BEACH ALSO A FORMER TEACHER HOW MUCH EDUCATION IS CHANGED IN JUST THE LAST YEAR AND EVERYTHING THAT THE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND WHAT THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH IN THE LAST YEAR. SO I FOUND IT VERY INFORMATIVE BUT I WANT TO DOUBLE LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP- I HEARD ABOUT THE NUMBERS I HARD NUMBERS AND THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS THAT ARE NEEDED THE NUMBER OF THE SHORTAGE YOU KNOW IT WHEN I WAS A TEACHER I REALIZE THAT MANY TEACHERS WERE LIKE ME OLDER AND READY TO RETIRE AND NOW WE'VE SEEN THAT. NUMBERS INCREASE- BUT MORE THAN JUST THE NUMBERS. KEEPING IN MIND HOW MUCH EDUCATION IS CHANGED IN THE LAST YEAR- BOTH. BECAUSE OF COVERT AND THE- ONE YEAR THAT WE EXPERIENCE- THE BLACK LIVES MATTERS IN THE- OFFICES ON SOCIAL JUSTICE ONE THING THAT I DID NOT HEAR. VERY MUCH ABOUT AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE IS THE DIVERSITY OF THE TEACHING OF FIELD. I THINK OF THE PRESENTER FROM- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND IT ALLUDED TO THAT YOU KNOW HOW WELL TEACHERS ARE PREPARED I KNOW. IS I WAS A FIRST YEAR TEACHER AT ONE TIME AND ALSO THE FACT THAT STUDENTS. WE KNOW AND THE DATA SHOWS DO BETTER. WHEN THEY HAVE TEACHERS WHO LOOK LIKE THEM STANDING IN FRONT IN THE CLASSROOM. SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM MOST OF THE PANELISTS FROM UC FROM CSU FROM DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT. TONY THURMOND IN HIS FIRST YEAR SAID IT WAS GONNA BE A BIG EFFORT ON HIS PART TO CHANGE THE- THE COME WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE WHO THE TEACHERS ARE. SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING DO WE HAVE DATA FROM THE COMMISSION ON TEACHING CREDENTIALING AND WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THAT WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS- ETHNICALLY WHAT WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS RACIALLY HOW ARE WE DOING. AND IMPROVING THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN TEACHERS ARE WE DOING WITH LATINO TEACHERS AND I LAST THING AND I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM CSU UC- WHERE ARE WE IN PREPARING TEACHERS. WHO WILL BE- GOING TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES I KNOW THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS AT UC AND I BELIEVE CSU HAS A PROGRAMS AS WELL SO I KNOW THAT'S A LOT BUT I DO WANT TO HEAR- RESPONSE. UC CSU A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE COMMISSION OF TEACHING CREDENTIALING AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO MIGHT WANNA. CHIME IN. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING- I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE EFFORTS THAT THAT- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS MAKING AS FAR AS DIVERSIFYING THE TEACHER WORKFORCE- SO THE SUPERINTENDENT- GATHERED A COMMITTEE- TO COME TOGETHER AND TO SEEK RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO DIVERSE BY THE TEACHER WORKFORCE I THINK CDC MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE US- NUMBERS AND STATISTICS AS FAR AS WHAT OUR WORKFORCE LOOKS LIKE IN CALIFORNIA- BUT PRIMARILY IT'S FEMALE- AND IT'S WHITE. SO WE KNOW THAT- AND WE DID GIVE YOU SOME SOME NUMBERS THOUGH THAT TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ARE INCREASING- ALLOWED MAX A NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHICH IS EXCELLENT- AND BUT THEY'RE NOT SEEING A HUGE RISE- AN AFRICAN AMERICAN I THINK ABOUT REPORT- ARE IN THOSE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS- BUT GETTING BACK TO OUR OUR COMMITTEE THAT WE- HAD TRAVIS DR TRAVIS BRISTOL- OVERSEE WE BROUGHT TOGETHER ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT PANELS- FROM THE HIGH LEVELS AND- DISTRICTS AT COUNTY LEVEL AND AT THE TEACHER LEVEL. AND TO FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING STATEWIDE TO DIVERSIFY THEIR TEACHER WORKFORCE THEY PUT TOGETHER A- RECOMMENDATION A REPORT THAT WILL BE POSTING VERY SOON AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HOSTING A WEBINAR AT THE END OF THIS MONTH ABOUT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS- AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY WE CREATED- THROUGH OUR OFFICE OUR BRANCH- A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE- SO WE ARE GATHERING REPRESENTATIVES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OUR FINDING OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING LOCALLY TO DIVERSE BY THE TEACHER WORKFORCE AND WE HOPE TO PUT OUT A NUMBER OF. RESOURCES FOR OTHER DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA- TO IF THERE'S NOT FUNDING AVAILABLE WHAT ARE SOME DIFFERENT METHODS THEY CAN USE TO DIVERSE BY THE TEACHER WORKFORCE STATEWIDE. THANK YOU. YES CSU OR UC. YES HI- ARE MEMBER MEDINATHANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- YES THAT YOU SEE- THE DIVERSITY OF OUR TEACHER PREPARATION STUDENTS AND ADMINISTRATOR PREPARATION STUDENTS ARE IS OF ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES THAT WE- THAT WE- WE'VE SOUGHT AND WORKED HARD TO- TO ADDRESS. CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW ABOUT 34% OF OUR TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES COME FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUNDS THAT INCLUDES AFRICAN AMERICAN. HISPANICS LATINOS NATIVE AMERICAN FILIPINO WITH THE LARGEST GROUP ABOUT 30% BEING CHICANA LATINA X. AND OVER IF YOU IF YOU INCLUDED ON NON UNDER REPRESENTED- ASIAN BASTIONS FROM ANONYMOUS. SKEWS ME STILL FROM NON UNDER. ASIAN BACKGROUNDS- ON OVER HALF OF OUR TV CANDIDATES OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR BUT WE WANTED TO WE WANT TO DO MORE- WE THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE TO ADDRESS- A DIVERSE ENGINES HELP SUPPORT A DIVERSE TEACHER WORKFORCE- AND ONE OF THE- STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE BEEN- UNDERTAKING HAS BEEN MORE INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT. AND OUTREACH AND- IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND UNDER REPRESENTED AREAS IN THE WORLD COMMUNITIES- IN ORDER TO FAMILIARIZE THEM WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU SEE HAS TO OFFER- AND THE OTHER IS- AND MENTION THIS IN MY TESTIMONY THE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. WE'RE SEEING EVIDENCE OF MUCH GREATER DIVERSITY THAT- IS REPRESENTED IN THOSE PROGRAMS UCLA PROGRAM- IS HIGHLY DIVERSE AND WHERE WE SEE THAT AS A PROMISING PRACTICE THAT WE CAN SCALE UP ACROSS ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS AND ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES. AND SECONDLY- THIRDLY- YOUR YOUR QUESTION REGARDING ETHNIC STUDIES PATHWAYS YES WE DO HAVE ETHNIC STUDIES PATHWAYS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN OUR UC RIVERSIDE UCLA- AND YOU SEE MORE SAD AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE THE OTHER UC CAMPUSES ARE EXPLORING WAYS TO. INTEGRATE ETHNIC STUDIES. PATHWAYS INTO THEIR CURRICULUM. THANK YOU AND IT MAYBE WE COULD HEAR FROM CSU CSU FOR THE EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. QUESTION WE HAVE A GROUP OF OUR COLLEGE OF ED AND SCHOOL OF EDUCATION DEAN'S THAT HAVE CREATED AN EQUITY IN CLARET AND EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION GROUP AND THEY LOOK SPECIFICALLY TO THIS. ISSUE ON HOW TO DO GROW YOUR OWN AND HOW TO INCREASE THE NUMBER IN ALL OF THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES EVENTS SO THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO DO THAT. WE HAVE A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO ARE GRADUATES AND WE BRING THEM TOGETHER AND CREATE A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE TO HELP WITH THE RETENTION ISSUE OUR RECRUITMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS STILL REMAINS. EXTREMELY SMALL AND ABOUT 3% WE DO HAVE ABOUT LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE IN US AND SO THE IMPROVE THE RECRUITMENT FOR LATINOS AND LATINAS HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD AND HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER TIME. AND AS FOR ETHNIC STUDIES WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO DEVELOPING ETHNIC STUDIES PATHWAYS AND MOST OF OUR SITE- SINGLE SUBJECT PROGRAMS. THANK YOU N. NOT SURE IF WE WANNA HEAR OF- EITHER- DESIREE OR- DOCTOR RIXEY SANDY MIGHT HAVE- ANYTHING THAT THEY'D LIKE TO AT. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN IF WE DO HAVE DATA THAT WE COLLECT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STAFF DEMOCRATIC THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA THAT IS REPORTED ANNUALLY- SO IN TERMS OF THE GENDER RACE AND ETHNICITY ETHNIC ETHNIC DISTRIBUTION OF TEACHERS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIFTY NINE POINT 1% OF THE TEACHERS- SOUTHWARD AS WHITE. OF THREE POINT 9% AFRICAN AMERICAN TWENTY TWO POINT 8% IN SPANISH OR LATINO. IN THE CURRENT WORKFORCE ARE IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT IN TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY HERE. THIRTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT. OF THE ENROLLED CANDIDATES SELF DECLARED AS WHITE. THREE POINT 9% LACK OF THIRTY TWO POINT 5% HISPANIC. AND THAT'S KIND OF THE BROAD BREAKDOWN IN TERMS OF AS BIG A DISTRIBUTION IN THE EXISTING ENDING INCOME WORKFORCE. AND IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO JUST ADD ADD ON TO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN STATED I'M WE HAVE LOOKED AT SOME DATA SHOWING THAT- BLACK TEACHERS IN PARTICULAR ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENTER THE TEACHING PROFESSION IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH. ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION PATHWAYS OR- WITH EMERGENCY STYLE CREDENTIALS AND PERMITS IN FACT- FEWER THAN HALF OF BLACK TEACHERS RECEIVE ANY STUDENT TEACHING BEFORE BECOMING A TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS REALLY A SOBERING FACT. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT I'M HAVING THAT COMPREHENSIVE PREPARATION IS KEY TO BEING RETAINED AND THE TEACHER WORKFORCE AND SO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT ACCURATE MANY TEACHERS OF COLOR COME INTO THE FIELD BUT THEN THAT- THAT LACK OF PREPARATION CAN CREATE HIGH TURNOVER RATES THAT UNDERMINE THAT GROWTH- AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT THE RESEARCH SAYS ABOUT WHY. TEACHERS OF COLOR AND BLACK TEACHERS IN PARTICULAR MORE LIKE TO LEAD TO ENTER THROUGH- ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION PATHWAYS IN THE KEY. FACTOR THERE IS THE COST OF PREPARATION AND BEING ABLE TO ACCESS TEACHER EDUCATION- AND SO I THINK THIS GOES BACK TO SOMETHING I MENTIONED BEFORE WHICH IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE NAVIGATION SUPPORT SO THAT- POTENTIAL CANDIDATES OF COLOR CAN ACCESS IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS THAT THE STATE HAS MADE. IN THE PRESIDENCIES AND THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM AND SO ON- IN ADDITION TO POST TWO PROGRAMS ARE THESE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS THEY CAN CREATE A PATHWAY FROM WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE TEACHER OR WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE DIVERSITY IN THE STATE WHICH IS IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'M INTO THAT IS YOU KNOW POTENTIAL OUT OF PLACE TO FOCUS- YOU KNOW TO INCREASE OUR DIVERSITY. THANK ARE AND I JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY THE TEACHING PROFESSION. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU MR O'DONNELL. IS THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK I'M I'M SEEING A MAJOR DISCONNECT AGAIN. BETWEEN THE CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE TO SACRAMENTO YOU KNOW ALL THESE PROGRAMS ARE GOOD I'M SURE THEY HELP. BUT IF YOU'RE A NEW TEACHER YOU'RE LOOKING TO GO INTO THE PROFESSION LOOK AT THE POLITICAL DYNAMIC OUT THERE. ON THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT. RIGHT EDUCATION HAS BEEN WEAPONIZED SO WHAT'S GOING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET IN THE CLASSROOM WILL BETTER PAY FOR SURE AND SOMETHING WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ENOUGH UP HERE ALL THIS MONEY INTO PROGRAMS IS GREAT BUT LOWER CLASS SIZES WE HAVE THE HIGHEST CLASS SIZES IN THE NATION THAT SPEAKS TO STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH INSIDE THE CLASSROOM THE SIZE OF A CLASS ALSO TEACHER MAIL. A SUB OVER THE FALL THE CLASS SIZES WERE LOWERBECAUSE MANY STUDENTS WERE THERE THEY WERE QUARANTINED RIGHT SO IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM HAVE TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR STUDENTS SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENS RIGHT THE TONE OF THE OF THE DAY OF THE CLASS CHANGES SO I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO TALK ABOUT WORKING CONDITIONS AND PAY NOT JUST ALL THESE PROGRAMS TO LAND PEOPLE TO SCHOOL SITE. BUT TO KEEP THEM THERE AND AGAIN I JUST THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A REAL DISCONNECT AND I APPRECIATE ALL THESE PROGRAMS I'M NOT SAYING- THEY SHOULDN'T EXIST AS MUCH AS I'M SAYING THERE'S A LOT MORE WE NEED TO DO AND IT'S KIND OF AGAIN INSIDE BASEBALL HERE PROGRAMS PROGRAMS PROGRAMS. NOT SALARY NOT CLASS SIZE NOT LOOKING AT HOW PEOPLE OVERALL LOOK AT THE TEACHING PROFESSION AND IF WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE PROPOSED BUDGET RIGHT NOW HAS A FIVE POINT 33% KUALA AND THAT'S CREATING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT A LOT OF NEW PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET. THEY HAVE SCHOOL PROGRAMS ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF GREAT GREAT EVERYONE'S AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS I WANT THEM BUT LOOK AT THIS FIVE POINT 33% COLA YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T DECREASE CLASS SIZES WITH THAT YOU CAN'T PAY PEOPLE MORE MONEY WITH THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY CREATING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT A STRUCTURAL CLASSROOM DEFICIT WHEN THE ON GOING TO. LIST FOR STATUS QUO TO THE EXPENSES FOR NEXT YEAR ARE GOING INCREASED THIRTEEN POINT AVERAGE SEVEN POINT 5% CPI PLUS PROBABLY HIGHER TODAY RIGHT- INCREASES OF STIRS AND PURSUE DISTRICTS THIS YEAR AS OPPOSED TO LAST YEAR TWO POINT 35% THEN OTHER COST PRESSURES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO DISTRICTS NON CPA CPI pTHIRTEEN POINT EIGHTY FIVE IT EIGHT FIVE PER. AND THE OFFER NOW. ON THE TABLE BUILT IN THE BUDGET IS LANDED YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATORS LAPIS FIVE POINT THREE THREE PERCENT. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IF WE'RE GOING. TO LOWER CLASS SIZES WHICH WE NEED TO DO. IF WE'RE GOING TO PAY TEACHERS ARE RESPONSIBLE SALARY WHICH WE NEED TO DO IF WE WANT TO KEEP THEM. NOT JUST GET HIM IN THE CLASSROOM. WE NEED TO ADD MONEY INTO THAT BASE ALLOCATION- SO I TURN IT BACK TO YOU STRUCTURE. YES I'LL GET TO THAT IN A BIT- THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL AWESOME COMMENTS MR LEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I DEFINITELY WANT TO ALSO SYMPATHIZE AND AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH IS ALL ABOUT INCREASING THE BASS BUT OVERALL GENERALLY WANT TO. THANKTHE PANEL SERVING HERE. AND ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR CITING THE HIGH COST OF TEACHING AND LIVING IN MY HOME COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY IT SEEMS EVERYONE'S FAVORITE EXAMPLE. IS MY HOME COUNTY. SANTA CLARA COUNTY BUT THAT IS I THINK THE REAL IMPEDIMENT WE HAVE RIGHT WELL AS WE HAVE. MORE STAB WISH MORE SENIOR TEACHERS AGING OUT RETIRING RIGHT NOW. AND FRANKLY WHO CAN BLAME THEM AFTER THAT TWO THREE YEARS THEY'VE BEEN THOROUGH. NOW WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE INCREASE THE WORKFORCE OF EDUCATORS AND EDUCATION STAFF RIGHT. I HAVE A LOT OF CONSTITUENTS AND A LOT OF FRIENDS EVEN IN MY AGE RANGE AT ALL TRYING TO COME TEACHERS. BUT THERE IS THE ONEROUS REALITY THAT PICKUP TO BECOME A STUDENT TEACHER. YOUR PAYING TO WORK AND THIS IS UNLIKE MANY OTHER FIELDS WERE IF YOU BECOME A MEDICAL PRACTITIONER OF SOME SORT YOUR RESIDENCY YOU GENERALLY HAVE SOME SORT OF- CUSHIONED- ASH. IT WOULD APPEAR PROVIDED FOR ABBOTT THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS EVEN IN MY EAR IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT ESPECIALLY IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR PAT IT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE AND IT'S A HUGE BARRIER I THINK SO I REALLY LIKE OBVIOUSLY HAVING OUR PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE MORE TIME NEW TEACHERS GET IN LIKE. THE GOLDEN STATE'S FUTURE PROGRAMMING THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM BUT I WONDER SOMETIMES IF THIS IS IN ITSELF KIND OF LIKE GOING BACK TO MR DONALD'S COMMENTS KILEY CREATING MORE PROGRAMS A BUREAUCRACY FOR SOON WE HAVE THINK ABOUT HOW TO INCENTIVIZE BRING IN NEW EDUCATORS AND NOT SAY WELL OKAY WHEN I PUT UP ALL THIS WALL YOU HAVE TO DO ALL THESE LITTLE STEPS SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE MORE COMPLICATED I DON'T KNOW IF WHO WOULD BE THE RIGHT PERSON ASKED US TO DO IS. YOU KNOW WE'RE COMMITTING ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS IN TE NEXT COUPLE YEARS TO I INTO DEVISING OR ENCOURAGING NEW TEACHERS A RETAINING NEW TEACHERS ALWAYS A STUDENT TEACHERS WOULD NOT BE MORE SIMPLE FIGHT EVEN IN JUST THE SAME CRITERIA TEACHERS TO JUST GIVE THEM THE MONEY RATHER THAN DOING ALL THESE ALL THESE PROGRAMS BUT JUST ENCOURAGE THEM TO HAVE THIS A WHILE YOUR STUDENT TEACHER YOU ARE PROVIDED FOR YOU HAVE COMPENSATION AND YOU CAN DO THIS AND THEN YOU COME OF TEACHER RATHER THAN HAVING TO. WELL MAKE SURE IF I AM IN THE RIGHT STATE YOU'RE RIGHT SCHOOL THE RIGHT CRITERIA ECCENTRIC ETCETERA I AM FILLING OUT ALL THESE APPLICATIONS DOING THESE THINGS ON TOP OF BEING A STUDENT TEACHER WOULD NOT BE SIMPLER TO THAT I WONDER IF IT WOULD COST MORE COSTS LESS THAT'S MYKINDA GENERAL BROAD BROAD QUESTIONS OUR PANEL SAYS WOULD IT COST MORE OR WOULD BE OR COSTS MORE COST LESS TO JUST PAY INCOMING SIN TEACHERS AT THE RATE THAT WE'RE HAVING OR SEEN THEM AT. OUR END WOULD BE. SIMPLER JUST TO GIVE THEM THE COMPENSATION. WHO'S THAT QUESTION DIRECTED TO MR LEE. I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE BEST PERSON WOULD BE MAYBE L. A. L. I WAS THINKING MAYBE C. T. C. A. R. CITY SOON SURE. WEALTHY I WISH I HAD A GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK IN AN IDEAL WORLD AND IN SOME COUNTRIES THEY DO JUSTICE THEY PAY FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE WORK FORCE. WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HAVE ELECTED TO DO THIS. THROUGH A VARIETY OF- OF PROGRAMS THAT DO PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR THE INCOMING WORKFORCE THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM. COULD B CONSIDERED A PAID STUDENT TEACHING PLACEMENT. OF FOR SOMEONE BRAIDED THAT- MADE MAKING ALSO OF USE OF THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT WE HAVE SOME ABILITY TO- TESTS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT IT CERTAINLY IS. OF ALL BY ITSELF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ISN'T NECESSARILY A LIVING WAGE IN MANY PLACES IN THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT- I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE IDEA IN A WORTHWHILE QUESTION TO STUDY- FOR NOW WE'RE HAPPY TO. SUPPORT EVER INVESTMENTS IN THE WORK FORCE. OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT BEFORE US. IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR CAN I AWAY AND QUICKLY SO I ANYWAY FROM THE ALLEY GO I THINK I WOULD JUST ADD TO THIS CONVERSATION THAT. THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM THOSE ARE MORE TARGETED EFFORTS THAT FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE AREAS OF CHRONIC SHORTAGE THAT WE EXPERIENCE OUT THINGS LIKE SPECIAL EDUCATION IN THE STEM FIELDS BILINGUAL. AND NOW TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THESE ARE VERY INTENTIONAL TARGETS FOR THESE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS I THINK IN TERMS OF YOUR IDEA IT'S JUST A CONSIDERING THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN BROADER. I'M FUNDS FOR STUDENT TEACHING VERSES THIS MORE TARGETED APPROACH THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN IN THE PAST. THANK YOU FOR THAT. OKAY THANK YOU MR DRY. OKAY YEAH I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS SO AS WAS NOTED BY MR LEE- WE APPROPRIATED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS TO THESE ISSUES. LAST YEAR BEING SPENT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THIS YEAR JANUARY BUDGET THIS HAS FIFTY MILLION CELL I THINK IT'S BETTER TO LOOK AT THAT BILLION. OUR HAS BEEN THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAN JUST FOCUSING SOLELY ON THE- ON THE FIFTIES OF COURSE WERE DOING LITTLE OVERSIGHT TODAY AND THEY GO GOING FORWARD. I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE WE'VE HEARD THIS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS- YOU KNOW RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. L. WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT PROBABLY BOTH IMPORTANT BUT WE KNOW WE'VE HEARD ABOUT AS THE- AGENDA NOTES THAT THE TEACHER. SHORTAGE ISSUE FOR TWENTY YEARS SO I REMEMBER WHEN I HAD THIS JOB. TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE IS A CAL GRANT PROGRAMS LANGUAGE THE CAL GRANT T. FOR TEACHERS BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE MONEY TO GO THE TEACHER PROFESSION. SO WE'VE BEEN ON THIS CASE FOR. A LONG TIME. AND HELLO PORTENT SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON MORE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AND IS IT THAT YOU KNOW THE ISSUE THAT TEACHERS WHO AREN'T STICKING AROUND IS THAT IT'S A STRESSFUL JOB. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING PAID ENOUGH I MEAN LITERALLY RIGHT DOWN THE STREET OR HAVING A DEBATE WITH MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE LOCAL TEACHERS. ASSOCIATION- SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE CAN PUT INTO THESE PROGRAMS THEY ALL GOES BACK TO ARE WE ADEQUATELY FUNDING. OUR SCHOOLS. WITH FLEXIBLE MONEY TO ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE OUR TEACHERS IN THIS WORK FORCE SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN MAXIMIZE MONEY. TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COMING MONTHS AND SELL WORKED AS PART THAT FOR NOW BUT BACK TO- THAT THE MAYBE I CAN ASK- THE L. P. IRCTC. ARE ARE WE ON THE RIGHT PATH ARE WE MAKING SURE WE'RE SPENDING ALL THIS MASSIVE INFUSION OF MONEY THAT THE BILLION FROM LAST YEAR AND I GUESS A FIFTY MILLION THIS YEAR AND THE RIGHT IN THE RIGHT SPOTS TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE I KNOW WE NEED TO PAY TEACHERS WELL TO STICK IN THERE FOR THE LONG RUN AND- MOST TEACHERS DO IT NOT TO BECOME RICH BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE JOB A LOT OF THE KIDS. IN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW TAKE CARE THEM ALONG THE WAY TO THEIR INCENTIVIZE TO STICK AROUND. BUT OF THESE EXTRA EFFORTS WERE DOING HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH. I THANK YOU VERY SANTEE WITH THE COMMISSION. I THINK IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR- PROPOSITION- RECRUITMENT OR RETENTION I THINK YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON BOTH. IF WE ONLY FOCUS ON RECRUITMENT AND WE'RE NOT INTENDED TO THE RETENTION OF OUR WORK FORCE. OF WE WERE MISSING A HUGE PART OF WHAT'S NECESSARY TO KEEP A STABLE WORKFORCE IN OUR SCHOOLS AND THAT IS TO PROVIDE THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF THE- THE OTHER KINDS OF FACTORS. OF THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY LPI AND OTHERS. SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO DO BOTH THINGS. I BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. LONG TERM IT INITIATIVE- IT THE RESEARCH ON RESIDENCIES IS THAT THEY ARE PREPARING- TEACHERS WELL AND THE TEACHERS WERE COMING THROUGH RESIDENCY PROGRAMS TEND TO STAY IN THE PROFESSION. AND THIS IS KEY THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ADDRESSING BOTH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION BY PROVIDING SUPPORTED WAY INTO TEACHING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF. IS AN IMPORTANT ARTIFACT THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT AS WE MOVE FORWARD- AND IDEALLY BEGIN TO REDUCE THE SHORTAGES THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING SO I THINK IT'S NOT EITHER OR- AND I THINK THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS BEING BUILT RIGHT NOW. AND PROVIDING THAT THE FUNDING LIKE FOR THE CLASSIFIED GRANT PROGRAMS FOR LOCAL REGIONAL GROW YOUR OWN EFFORTS TO BRING A MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITY INTO THE INTO THE WORK FORCE. THESE ARE THESE ARE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT DO BUT TEND. TO BOTH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. SO LET ME FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS A THERE RESEARCH. FOCUSING ON. WHEN TEACHERS LEAVE WHY THEY LEAVE IS BECAUSE IT'S IF IT WEREN'T PROPERLY PREPARED TO THE JOB AND RESIDENCIES REALLY HELPS THAT. MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SUCCEED AS ECONOMIC FACTORS OF COURSE PAID WILL GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE AS MUCH STRESS. WHAT DO WE THINK IS THAT IS THE FACTOR THERE MOST. REPORTING FACE I KNOW I KNOW THERE'S RESEARCH OUT THERE AND I'M WONDERING IF DESIREE CARVER TANYA LPI. JANICE HERO HE ARE PROBABLY HAS DONE SOME RESEARCH IN THIS AREA. YES MY PLEASURE A DESIREE CARVER THOMAS THAT LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE AND WE HAVE STUDIED THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT TEACHER RETENTION- AND THERE'S SEVERAL FACTORS THAT- ARE ARE INVOLVED- ONE ASPECT IS ACCESS TO- AT CONFERENCE OF TEACHER PREPARATION. SO WE KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ENTER THE FIELD WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE PREPARATION HAVE- TURNOVER RATE THERE TWO TO THREE TIMES AS GREAT AS THOSE WINTER WITH. THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PREPARATION WE ALSO KNOW THAT- ACCESS TO MENTORING AND INDUCTION- IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER RETENTION- ACCESS TO GREATER COMPENSATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER ATTENTION ENOUGH IS ALSO. THAT IMPORTANT RECRUITMENT STRATEGY AS WELL- YOU KNOW THERE'S- A HOST OF. WHERE CONDITIONS THAT MATTER AND ONE OF THE PRIMARY WORKING CONDITIONS THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH- TURNOVER IS ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SO THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT OUR TEACHERS WHO REPORT THAT THEIR ADMINISTRATOR IT'S NOT ENCOURAGING OR SUPPORTIVE LEAVE THE PROFESSION IT OR THEIR CLASSROOMS THAT OUT MORE THAN TWICE THE RATE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SAY THAT THEIR ADMINISTRATION. IS SUPPORTIVE AND SO YOU KNOW THAT I THINK POINTS TO. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS OF SOME OF THE- INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN AT AT TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY ONE C. SLA- FOR EXAMPLE- AND ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF- THE INVESTMENTS IN AS- IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANT- WHICH USED TO- DEVELOP. TEACHER LEADERSHIP AND- AT AN EFFICACY SO ALL THESE THINGS ARE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH- RETENTION AND I WOULD. JUST ECHO THE POINT THAT YOUR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION- REALLY INEXTRICABLE- WE KNOW THAT BEING BETTER PREPARED LEADS TO BEING BETTER RETAINED- AND SO THOSE THOSE REALLY GO TOGETHER IN ADDITION. REDUCING TURNOVER RATES REDUCES THAT THE DEMAND FOR TEACHERS SO CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT AN EIGHT PERCENT- ATTRITION RATE PEOPLE LEAVING THE PROFESSION IN THE STATE- AND THAT IS- ABOUT AVERAGE AT ABOUT A SIMILAR TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE- OF- ADD TURNOVER RATES- STATES- THERE OTHER STATES. AND IN OTHER SCHOOL SYSTEMS AROUND THE COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD WHERE- YOU KNOW TEACHERS STATE OF LONGER THAN THEY DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO IF WE COULD REDUCE OUR- TEACHER TURNOVER RATES TO BE COMPARABLE WITH HIGH PERFORMING SCHOOL SYSTEMS. IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW THAT WOULD REDUCE THE NEED TAPPED TO CONTINUALLY NEED TO HIRE MORE NEW TEACHERS SO THESE REAL PEACE THESE ISSUES REALLY PUT TOGETHER. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE TWO FACTORS WITH WITH ECONOMIC- FACTORS COMPENSATION AND- A JUST SALARY BUT YOU KNOW BENEFITS AND SO FORTH WE'RE SUPPORT WHAT DO WE FIND IS MORE OF AN INDICATOR AS FAR AS PEOPLE WERE LEAVING. THE PROFESSION EARLY ON. YEAH I IT I COULDN'T SAY THAT WE HAVE ONE FACTOR THAT- STAND OUT FROM THE REST IT REALLY IS A FULL PICTURE- AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT TEACHERS ON ON EACH OF THOSE FRIENDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE COMPENSATION SO THAT THE DOLLARS AND SENSE OF WORK TO BE A TEACHER- WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH INCREASED SALARIES OR LESS THAT. LESS STUDENT DEBT LIKE THROUGH THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM OR BY HAVING TO SUBSIDIZE HOUSING SO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE AND WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES- AND THEN ALSO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY COME TO SCHOOL THEY'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE SUPPORTED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE POINT THAT WAS MADE ABOUT TEACHER DIVERSITY- TEACHER WORKING CONDITIONS REALLY MATTER FOR THAT- AND SOMETHING LIKE A WORKING CONDITIONS SURVEY HELPS OUT COULD HELP THE STATE. TO PROVIDE MORE TAILORED- IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE BOARD SO THAT WE CAN SEE DISAGGREGATE WILL WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATORS WHICH YOU KNOW WE'VE WRITTEN A REPORT THAT SHOWS THAT THEY'RE REALLY DISTINCT- WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR TEACHERS OF COLOR IN THE STATE WHERE ARE THERE PLACES THAT ARE DOING A BETTER JOB AT RETAINING A CERTAIN STAFF MEMBERS THAT. ARE IN HARD TO STAFF POSITIONS- AND WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THAT WAS AND KIND OF SCALE ACROSS THE STATE. SO LET'S LAST YEAR AS AS WAS NOTED BY MR LEAD TO STEPPED OUT WE HAD IT YOU KNOW ONCE IN A- GENERATION TYPE OF A BUDGET DID A LOT OF THINGS WITH. YOU KNOW. BUT A BILLION DOLLARS INTO THIS ISSUE. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO AND SO WHICH PROGRAMS WE THINK HAVE THE MOST. AMERICAN SUCCESS SO. WE'VE SPENT THE LION'S SHARE ON THREE. THAT THE TEACHER GRANT CONSIDER GRANT PROGRAM TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES CREDENTIALING. PROGRAM ON. THE TO MR MEDINA'S QUESTIONS FAR AS- DIVERSITY IN. IT DO WE HAVE. ANY INDICATION OF WHICH ONES OF THESE. WOULD PRODUCE AND SUPPORT A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE WHEN I WHEN I SAW FOR EXAMPLE FROM THAT CLASSIFIED TEACHER. PROGRAM WHICH I WORKED ON THAT. SEVERAL YEARS AGO. YEAH THE NUMBERS COMING FROM THAT WERE OFF THE CHARTS AS FAR AS DIVERSITY CAN LOOK WHO ARE CLASSIFIED IN PLACE MOST LIKELY VERY VERY DIVERSE- DO WE HAVE ANY INDICATORS IS THAT. MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THAT ISSUE ARE SOME. MORE DIVERSE THAN OTHERS THE THREE PROGRAMS. DAVID TO CARE FROM. MISSION OF THE CREDENTIAL- WITH WE CAN START WITH LOOKING AT THE CLOCK OF NINETY. ON EMPLOYEE FRIENDLY PROGRAM. AND WE FIND THAT OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS- ONLY. ABOUT 30% OF THE GRANT WENT TO CANDIDATES WHO ARE WHAT THE CLERK IS ALWAYS BEEN WHITE SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO THE PEOPLE OF COLOR THE RESIDENCY GRANTS. SO I THINK THAT THESE TWO PROGRAMS- DEFINITELY ARE. ATTRACTING AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF TEACHERS OF COLOR- I THINK IF YOU'RE- INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT RETENTION I THINK WHAT DESIREE CARVER THOMAS TALKED ABOUT TERMS OF STATE WHEN I MET STUDIES LIKE OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO LOOK AT SO THAT YOU ARE GETTING NEARLY DATA- FROM. THE TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOMS AS TO HOW THEY PERCEIVE- BUT CONDITIONS IN THEIR SCHOOL YES I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THIS THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF. PARTICIPANTS IS IT IS IT ABOUT OF THESE THREE IS IT ARE THEY ABOUT THE SAME AT THE EXISTING TEACHER WORKFORCE WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT GREAT. ARE THEY SOME MUCH HIGHER AND WHICH ONES HAVE HAD ART HAS SHOW THE MOST PROMISE AS FAR AS- DIVERSIFYING OUR WORKFORCE. SO THE CURRENT TEACHER WORKFORCE IS APPROXIMATELY 60%WHITE 40% TEACHERS OF COLOR- THE RESIDENCY GRANTS AND THE- CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE GRANTS. ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR- SO THOSE ARE THOSE TARGETED GRANTS ARE WORKING- I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE GOLDEN STATE SO MAYBE SOMEONE FROM C. SACRAMENTO ABOUT ONE. MCCARTY THIS IS- JAKE PARTNER WITH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION I DON'T HAVE- BRACE THAT NEEDS TO BE DATA OR DEMOGRAPHIC DATA OF THAT KIND TODAY WITH ME ON THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM BUT I'M HAPPY TO GO BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES AND SEE WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO YOU IN THE COMMITTEE. OKAY. I'M LET'S SEE BACK TO MR MEDINA COME BACK FOR A FINAL QUESTION. ALL RIGHT I WANT TO. THANK A DESIREE- FOR- LISTING AND ANSWERING OUR OUR CHAIRS QUESTION ON TEACHER RETENTION AND TO ALSO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH YOU KNOW WHETHER OF THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN SACRAMENTO AND WHAT ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE IN THE CLASSROOM- SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT THAT ARE. PERHAPS WITHIN OUR CONTROL ARE NOT IN OUR CONTROL RIGHT A TEACHER PAY THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE FACTORS THAT CERTAINLY AFFECT TEACHERS. AND IF WE REDUCE CLASS SIZE WE KNOW WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BETTER LEARNING OUTCOMES AS WELL PROBABLY HAVE- HIGHER- TEACHER SATISFACTION WITH SMALLER LASS SIZE YOU KNOW I IF WE LOOK BACK EAST I'VE HEARD OF CLASSES YOU KNOW OUT IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT WHERE THEY MAYBE HAVE. TWENTY STUDENTS PER TEACHER AND- I'M SURE THERE TEACHERS PROBABLY STAY LONGER BUT THE AND PAY YOU KNOW I DO NOT WANNA DIMINISH- HOW IMPORTANT TEACHER PAY IS WELL I WHEN I WAS A TEACHER CAME HERE JOINT PROBABLY TWENTY THOUSAND TEACHERS AND WE- ARE RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL. AND MARCHED HERE OF FOR INCREASED TEACHER PAY AND WE GOT IT THAT YEAR. AND FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS THAT YOU KNOW TEACHER PAY WENT UP BUT THOSE ARE NOT THE ONLY FACTORS THAT AFFECT A TEACHER SATISFACTION AND THE ONE FACTOR THAT I WANTED TO ADD- IS NOT TANGIBLE LIKE THAT. LIKE THOSE YOU KNOW TO CLASS SIZE OR TEACHER PAY AND THAT IS TEACHER EMPOWERMENT THAT HAVE TEACHERS FELT EMPOWERED IN THEIR SCHOOLS IN THEIR CLASSROOM. THEY THEY WOULD STAY LONGER AND THAT DOES GO TO YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THEM AND THEIR- ADMINISTRATORS- IT THAT GOES TO PREPARATION- IN SERVICE BUT IT TEACHERS FELT MORE EMPOWERED I THINK THAT WOULD DO A LOT TO- TEACHER SATISFACTION JUST WANTED THAT THAT. STRUCTURE OKAY. THANK YOU. CHARMING MCCARTY YES MARK LAUDI MARTINA WITH THE UC- YEAH I JUST WANTED TO I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T COMMENT ON THAT POINT IN PARTICULAR AND RETENTION- BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA MAKE GREAT POINTS ABOUT THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF PRACTICING TEACHERS BEING ARMED CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK NOT. ANY MORE IMPORTANT PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER DO YOU TO WHAT TEACHERS HAVE BEEN- FACE WITH A STRUGGLING WITH THIS PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND SO I JUST WANTED TO- MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT WHICH IS THE STATE'S PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT NETWORK IN INTERSEGMENT ALL PROGRAMS THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ADMINISTERS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CSU AND THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IT'S DISCIPLINE SPECIFICS ACROSS ALL NINE- DISCIPLINES- IN THE STATE AND- IT SERVES OVER THIRTY THOUSAND TEACHERS. A YEAR PROBABLY OR NEW DATA WILL SHOW MORE BECAUSE WE'VE GONE TO PROVIDING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES WITH THESE INVESTMENTS ONLINE EXPANDING INTO- UNDERSERVED AREAS I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THAT THESE FUNDS THAT- THESE NEW THIS NEW INFUSION OF FUNDING IT IS ONE TIME STATE FUNDS THAT AND IN SOME CASES FEDERAL FUNDS- THAT THAT WILL EXPIRE AND SO WE AREN'T ABLE TO CREATE THE KINDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND- IN UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE AND WITH UNDERSERVED SCHOOLS TO THE EXTENT THAT WOULD LIKE TO. PERMANENTLY ON ONGOING BASIS BUT THESE SERVICES HAVE BEEN I THINK CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING TEACHERS- WHO HAVE HAD TO PET IT AND LEARN NEW STRATEGIES AND OUR NEW AND DIFFICULT CONDITIONS- SO THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PROGRAM THE SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT PROGRAMS ARE THE ONES WHERE THERE IS A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITIES BETWEEN OUR K. TWELVE DISTRICTS AND PARTNERS AND. TEACHERS ON THE GROUND EVERY DAY A YOUR ALL YOUR ROUND THAT BECAUSE THAT. WE HAVE BENEFITTED. THOSE THE INVEST AND WE ARE SEEING THAT THERE ARE- PROVIDED A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS ON AT THIS VERY CRITICAL TIME. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU I KNOW THE NEXT ISSUE IS FOCUSING ON SOME OF THE PROPOSALS AND ONE IS THE INTEGRATED TEACHER PREP PROGRAM BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT OVERALL COMPENSATION IT IT'S NOT COMPLICATED THAT IF YOU GO TO SCHOOL FOR FOUR YEARS TO GET A DEGREE YOU CAN GO GET A CAREER AND LOOK AT THE AVERAGE SALARY FOR THAT. YOU CAN GO GET A TEACHING JOB WHICH WILL BE LESS THAN THE AVERAGE SALARY YOU HAVE TO GO TO COLLEGE FOR ONE MORE YEAR YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID FOR THAT YEAR AND YET MORE DEBT SO. THAT I THINK IS A FACTOR WE CAN'T IGNORE AS WELL AND SO. I KNOW WE'RE GONNA GET TO THAT NEXT. BUT BUT I KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY HERE FROM. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM C-SPAN NEED FOR- ACCELERATE THROUGH THE MANAGEMENT SIDE. AND I WONDER- I KNOW THERE WAS SOME REPORTS AND- SOME. SOME EDUCATION PUBLICATIONS LAST WEEK TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING ALL THIS. PROGRAMS AND GRANTS STOP BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY. ON ON THE GROUND THESE DISTRICTS IS THAT MAKING MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE SO THE C. T. O. R. FINANCE RALLY- HAVE ANY INSIGHTS AS FAR AS- WHAT DID THAT. WHAT DOES THE- THE FIELD OUT THERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SCHOOL BOARDS YOU KNOW TEACHES THAT WHAT WHAT IT WHAT DID THEY SAY IS MOST NEEDED TO HELP ADDRESS THIS. RETENTION RECRUITMENT TEACHER SHORTAGE ISSUE. I'M IF I CAN SPEAK TO THE RETENTION ISSUE A LITTLE BIT I AGREE WITH THE PANELISTS THAT SAID IT I THINK WE NEED INVESTMENTS IN BOTH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AND WON- PROGRAM THAT'S ACTUALLY RAN THROUGH OUR OFFICE IS THE NATIONAL BOARD- INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WENT THROUGH LAST YEAR AT THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- INVESTMENT. AND WE'RE JUST REALLY EXCITED TO REPORT- THAT WE HAD OVER TWO THOUSAND APPLICANTS FOR THE SUBSIDY WHICH MEANS- TWO THOUSAND MORE NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHER IS IN CALIFORNIA AND OVER APPROXIMATELY I THINK TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED FOR THE INCENTIVES SO PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED- THAT WILL GET FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS- THAT BEING SAID I THINK MANY OF US TEACHERS- ENTER THE PROFESSION OF COURSE I ENTERED IT I THINK TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND A YEAR AND I WAS PART OF THE GROUP THAT GOT THE BUMP THAT UP TO THIRTY TWO AND THEN THIRTY FOUR WHICH WAS REALLY EXCITING. I AM BUT I WAS ALREADY IN RIGHT I WAS HOOKED IT WE DON'T DO IT FOR THE MONEY IT IS A CALLING AND I'M NOT SAYING I DON'T WANT MY BY FELLOW TEACHERS OUT THERE TO GET- RAISES THEY CERTAINLY CERTAINLY DESERVE IT- AFTER THESE. TOUGH YEARS- BUT MANY OF US WERE MORE SEEKING ADDITIONAL- SALARY ARE ONLY OPTION WE SEE IS TO GO BECOME ADMINISTRATORS WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID GOT MY ADMINISTRATIVE CREDENTIAL KNEW THAT THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT AND THEN WE LOSE THOSE REALLY GOOD TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOMS TO GO BECOME ADMINISTRATORS WHICH WE ALSO NEED REALLY GOOD ADMINISTRATORS RIGHT- BUT NATIONAL BOARD HAS SHOWN. THAT YOU RETAIN TEACHERS- ESPECIALLY IN DISTRICTS THAT GIVE THEIR OWN INCENTIVES SO I KNOW L. A. UST OFFERS A 15% PAY BUMP UP FOR NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHERS AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY'LL GET OUR NEW INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND LOOK AT THE FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS- SO PROGRAMS LIKE THAT THAT CAN KEEP. I'M IN CLASSROOM BECAUSE THEY CAN THAT EXTRA. OF FUNDING FOR THEMSELVES EXTRA SALARY AND THEN ALSO SOME MORE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT- AND MORE YOU KNOW PASSION THROUGH RENEWING THAT. NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFICATION I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. OKAY THANK YOU CHOI. REGARDING THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION- I WONDER IF OF THAT WERE SET ANY STUDY- REGION TO REGION ARE THEY ARE LIVING COSTS IS AT THE FRONT EVEN CITY TO CITY AND LIVING COSTS IS DIFFERENT TO THE CITY I COME FROM A CITY OF IRVINE IN ORANGE COUNTY. IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE- AT THE GASOLINE PUMP- OKAY LEARN REGULAR WAS- SIX DOLLARS TO ELEVEN WHY EVEN- LA WAS SO STATED FIVE EIGHTY NINE OFF. BELOW IS A IS. SIX DOLLARS SO AMONG OTHER FOOD PRICES- HOUSING COSTS OF OUR CD AT THE MINIMUM ONE BEDROOM WOULD BE- OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED I BELIEVE BUT OUR BALLPARK MONTH TO START LIVING COSTS IS MUCH MUCH HIGHER TEACHERS- AVERAGES SALARY IS A STEP AND COLUMN ALL PAY DOING THE VOICEOVER WHEN THEY ENTER IN EVEN ORANGE COUNTY LA ALL VENTURA- ONE SAN FRANCISCO OF THE ARTS EIGHTEEN. WELL IDEA ANY CONSIDERATIONS THE LEAVING COST OF A SUDDEN RETURN MY CITY. DR TRIED THE NEW A DIRECT THE QUESTION TO- ANYBODY I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING OFF TENS OKAY. WAS IT TAKEN SENATE. L. A. L. YES WE CAN TAKE A SHOT AT THAT THEM IN WITHOUT OUT TRY TO AN THAT QUESTION IF ANY OTHER PANELISTS WANNA JUMP AND SO ARE SO AS SEVEN CALL. THEY TO COME LAW THAT NOT GO ON A ON A BY LEVEL AND SO OFTEN TIMES YOU DO HAVE BURDEN UNITS DO ASKING FOR MORE HI YOU'RE A HIGHER SALARIES AND COMPENSATION TO REFLECT HIGHER COST OF LIVING WE'D SO WE DO SEE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN AVERAGE SALARY PER TEACHER. IF THAT'S HELPFUL. AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF THAT I KNOW I SERVED ON THE IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- IN ON BOARD- IN MY EARLY. CAREER AND THE TROUBLE- FOR THE IRVINE LOSS OF STRUCTURAL REFORM INTO LAW- THE- OF MY SCHOOL DISTRICT RECEIVED A MUCH MUCH LESS I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF FORMULA WHEN IT WAS CLASSIFIED AS A RURAL AREA NOT ALWAYS HAVE TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY AFTER YOU KNOW FORTY FIVE YEARS SO. ARM AT THAT SHOULD BE REFORMULATED ABOUT THE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PIE IS TO SAY IS NOT GROWING. SO IF OUR- IRVINE DE DEMO ALLOCATION DONE SOMEBODY HAS TO GET THE NECESSARY LIES OF THE PIES SO THEREFORE LIKE THAT- LA SQUID WOULD FIGHT TO DEATH- AND WOULD NOT ALLOW DESSEL. IT HAS BEEN AVERAGE ABOUT THE HUNDRED DOLLARS A LAST POST CHILDREN IN COMPARISON- A DISTRICTS- SO. THEY HAD TO COME UP WITH YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE UP BOB FOR DIFFERENT SYSTEM. FROM PRIVATE DONATIONS SO- PUBLIC SCHOOL FOUNDATION HAS BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO RAISE- YOU KNOW MONEY YOU KNOW FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO THEY BEEN COMPENSATING BUT NOT. WHEN THEY ARE BUDGET IS UNDERFUNDED- ADEN. IT THOUGH THEY- WANT. ARE ATTRACTED. INCENTIVIZE SOME TEACHER OVER THE TEACHERS JOB- NO BUDGET IS A FIX DONE IS NOT GROWINGBECAUSE OF THE ARE OLD FASHIONED OFF FORMULA SO THEY ARE STUCK SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IRVINE SCHOOL- THE BEGINNING TEACHERS ARE PAID THE MORE THAN NOT LIKE A COTTON GROUP FOR EVEN OF THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO AN ORANGE COUNTY. I THINK WHAT OUR BOTTOM LINE. IS THAT THE- STATE HAS TO REPEAT THINGS IF I EDUCATION IS OUR PRIORITY I KNOW ARADIA A NEW A 60% OF ALL STATE BUDGET IS ALLOCATED FOR EDUCATION BUT I THINK WE NEED TO. EXPAND THE AND- THE TEACHER IS SO NOBLE JOB BAR AND- WE ARE A PROPERLY COMPENSATED- AND THE PEOPLE WILL IN ALL. OF CRAZY TO BECOME A TEACHER FOR EVEN FOR GOOD- THE- STARTING SALARY AND ALSO PROVIDING. A HOUSING. FOR MIDDLE INCOME- EMPLOYEES ARE LIVING IN THAT THE- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE- OF HOMELESSNESS A SITUATION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING NO LOW INCOME BUT THE- WAY IT TEACHES TO BE LONG. OUR THE OUR LOW LOW INCOME ON A MIDDLE INCOME BUT THAT THEY ARE NOT HIGHLY ARE NOT- HI HIGHER INCOME OWNERS DEFINITELY MEDIUM LEVEL INCOME EARNERS SO WHEN THEY BEGIN SO HOW CAN THEY LIVE IN THE CITY WITH A SALARY. OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE- BUT- I DON'T. I THINK THAT MAY COME OUT TO BE MAYBE FIFTEEN TWENTY DOLLARS TO POWER- SO YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LEAVE- IN HIGH COST- ASSIDUOUS ADVOCACY OF IRVINE SO I. THINK WE NEED TO- REALLY- BRIEF. OUR FUNDING- AND LOOK TO A- SECTOR. OKAY THANK YOU. WE COME. LIVE NOW OKAY AT WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR THE EDUC EDUCATOR PIPELINE THIS OF COURSE IS ON TOP OF THE ONE BILLION OR SO THAT WE ALLOCATED LAST YEAR WHICH ARE MULTI YEAR- EFFORTS. SO WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO FINANCE LMAO THE COMMUNICABLE CHANCES OFFICE CVE NCTC. GOOD MORNING MEGAN PROVIDES PERMANENT FINANCE. THE TWENTY TWO YEAR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES INVESTMENT OF FIFTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF SCHOOLS TO HIRE QUALIFIED TEACHERS AND SUBSTITUTE. THIS FUNDING BUILDS UPON TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT TO PREPARE TRAIN AND RECRUIT A DIVERSE EDUCATOR WORKFORCE AS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL DURING THE PRIOR PANEL. AND TO REPLACE THE MEDICAL INVESTMENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S TEACHER SHORTAGE INCLUDE TWENTY FOUR MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO WAIVE CERTAIN TEACHER EXAMINATION FEES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. TWELVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO EXTEND THE CURRENT WAIVER OF FLAT CREDENTIAL AND PERMIT CREDENTIAL FEES FOR INDIVIDUALS ENTERING THE EDUCATOR WORK FOURTH THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR I'M FUNDING FOR ONE POSITION AT THE COMMISSION TO SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INTEGRATED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM. FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. THE PROPOSAL WILL BUILD ON PREVIOUS INVESTMENT PROVIDED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ALLOW FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLABORATIVE. IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AND FUNDING FOR TWO POSITIONS TO REESTABLISH THE PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAMS PROGRAM. IBM IS DESIGNED TO ASSIST LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND APPROVING HIRING AND RECRUITMENT PRACTICES. I'M IN THE GOVERNOR BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES A ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FIND- FOR EIGHT POSITIONS AT THE COMMISSION WHICH WILL SERVE AS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT IN CAREER COUNSELORS FOR PROSPECTIVE EDUCATORS. AS WELL AS ONE POSITION WHICH WILL WORK TO DEVELOP A MULTI FACETED PORTAL TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WANTING TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION INTO A P. RT K. THROUGH TWELVE CAREER. ADDITIONALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ONE POSITION ON GOING FOR THE COMMISSION TO CONTRACT FOR PUBLIC OUTREACH TO HIGHLIGHT THE VALUE AND BENEFITS OF EDUCATIONAL CAREER IN CALIFORNIA PRE K. THROUGH GRADE TWELVE SCHOOL. WHICH I'M SURE THE GOAL HERE IS THAT THAT PERSONAL MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM WAR TEAM MAP PROGRAM. OR IN POP I REACHED. WILL WORK TO COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER TO CREATE A COHESIVE SYSTEM TO IMPROVE RECRUITMENT AND THE EFFICIENCY OF THE STATE'S TEACHER CAREER PIPELINE. APERTURE REALLY AIMED AT ENSURING THAT ALL THE INFORMATION ON HOW TO BECOME A TEACHER IS AVAILABLE TO A PROSPECTIVE TEACHER. THE LAST GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTMENT BUT I'LL TOUCH ON IN SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE THOUSAND GENERAL FUND FOR FIVE POSITIONS AT THE COMMISSION TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE NUMEROUS LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS. AND PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH THE COMMISSION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AND THESE INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT NECESSARILY LIMITED TO A TEACHER RESIDENCY IS CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE CREDENTIALING GRANT INTEGRATED TEACHER PROGRAMS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE AT ONE AND THREE AUTHORIZATION. GRANTS- FOR THERE IS SOME. BILLING WHICH EXTENDS FLEXIBLE FOR SOME. TEACHERS AUTHOR. ANY OF THE CREDENTIAL PERMIT ISSUED BY THE COMMISSION TO SERVE IN A SUBSTITUTE TEACHING ASSIGNMENT ALIGNED WITH THAT AUTHORIZATION INCLUDING PERFECT AGENCIES. AT BRACKETT SIXTY CUMULATIVE DAYS FOR ANY ONE ASSIGNMENT- LASTLY THERE IS SOME TRAILER BILL AMENDING THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS. AT THIS LINK WHICH ADDRESSES TWO ISSUES THE FIRST THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO CONSISTENT METRICS TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAM. I MEAN THE LANGUAGE DEFINED CRITERIA TO MEASURE AND ASSESS PERFORMANCE AND THEN BACK IN THE LANGUAGE REQUIRED THAT GRANTEES PARTICIPATE IN ANY EXTERNAL ABOUT ITALIAN RATIO COORDINATED BY. AND BY THE COLLABORATIVE. AT BUT I COMPLETE MY REMARKS ON GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL- IN THE EDUCATORS FACE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANYQUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE. TIME THANK YOU NEXT L. L. IN NEARLY WITH L. A. L. SO THERE ARE SEVERAL EDUCATOR WORK FOR PROPOSED UNDER THE ITEM I PLAY TO WALK THROUGH OUR- FOR EACH OF THESE FOR. STARTING ON PAGE NINETEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. THERE STARTING FIRST WITH THE GOVERNORS OF NEW TEACHER RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES WHICH PROPOSES ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO CDC FOR NEW A CAREER COUNSELOR IS A NEW TEACHER RECRUITMENT WEB PORTAL AND A STATEWIDE PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE MODIFY THESE PROPOSALS TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO ONE OF THE EXISTING ENTITIES THAT ALREADY DO THIS WORK ATHER THAN CTC FORGET SINCE BOTH CD AND THE CENTRE ON TEACHING CAREERS ALREADY OPERATES AN ONLINE PLATFORM TO RECRUIT NEW TEACHERS TO THE PROFESSION. AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS THE CENTER ALSO HAS EXPERIENCE RUNNING STATEWIDE PREFER PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES AS WELL. THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES FOR CTC WHAT ESSENTIALLY DUPLICATE EXISTING EFFORTS RATHER THAN ESTABLISH ONE COORDINATED AUTHORITATIVE PLATFORM THAT ALL PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS CAN GO TO GUIDE THEM THROUGH A RATHER COMPLEX PROCESS. WE ALSO THINK THAT C. D. E. OR THE CENTER WOULD BE BETTER POSITIONED TO ACT SWIFTLY IN RESPONSE TO ANY PANDEMIC AND DRIVEN TEACHER SHORTAGES SINCE BOTH ALREADY HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND PARTNERSHIPS IN PLACE TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER THE VARIOUS TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH FUNDING EITHER ENTITY INCLUDING EXPERTISE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE ONLINE PLATFORM AND FUNDING SOURCE. PUZZLE TO REAR. THE ON. ASSISTANT TEAMS HE NOTS RECOMMENDS THE LEGISLATURE REJECTED THIS PROPOSAL. THE DISTRICTS ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO PERSONAL MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE EXPERTISE THROUGH THE FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM FICK MATT AND CURRENT- COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. CURRENTLY DISTRICTS CAN REQUEST VIC MATT TO STUDY AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE THE DISTRICT'S TEACHER HIRING PROCESS TEACHER RETENTION GREAT AND SUPPLY OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT P. MATS COULD HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS ESPECIALLY IF THE DISTRICT'S CURRENT PRACTICES ARE DRIVEN BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WHICH PAYMENTS ARE UNLIKELY TO CHANGE. WE ALSO THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REJECT THE PROPOSED TEACHER EXAMINATION AND CREDENTIALING FEE WAIVERS WE THINK THESE WAIVERS ARE UNLIKELY TO ATTRACT MORE TEACHERS TO THE PROFESSION. AND ADDRESS THE CURRENT TEACHER SHORTAGES ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST TEACHERS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THESE WAIVERS BEFORE APPLYING TO THESE PROPER GRAMS. OTHER EFFORTS SUCH AS STREAMLINING THE STATE'S COMPLEX CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS COULD EFFECTIVELY LOWER BARRIERS TO BECOMING A TEACHER. LASTLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE INTEGRATED UNDERGRADUATE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS THESE PROPOSALS THESE PROGRAMS OFFER A COST EFFICIENT AND QUICKER WAY FOR INTERESTED UNDERGRADUATES TO RECEIVE. TRAINING AND BECOME TEACHERS AFTER GRADUATING I'M I WILL PASS IT OVER TO PAUL STEEN HOUSING MY COLLEAGUE AT THE ALLEY- TO COVER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TEACHER CREDENTIALING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM PROPOSAL NEXT. THANK YOU BOSSINEY WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS YOUR GENDER NOTES ON PAGE EIGHTEEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. AS CONTACTS THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. BUDGET PROVIDED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FOR THE SAME PROGRAM AND IT FUNDED THREE PILOT PROGRAMS WHICH ARE ON YOUR- IN YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE EIGHTEEN. JUST WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR THIS IS NOT THE TWO PLUS TWO PROGRAM THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT IN ISSUE TWO- THIS IS A DIFFERENT GRANT IT WAS SET UP TO ALLOW ASPIRING TEACHERS. WHO ALREADY HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE TO TRAVEL TO A PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THERE ARE THE IDEAS THAT THE- STUDENT WOULD SIT IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSROOM OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE COMPUTER LAB. AND TAKE ONLINE TEACHER PREPARATION COURSEWORK. THROUGH A CAL STATE UNIVERSITY OR OTHER UNIVERSITY TEACHER PREP PROGRAM SO THESE ARE NOT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS USER POST BACCALAUREATE STUDENTS AND A TEACHER PREP PROGRAM TAKING AN ONLINE CLASS. IN PERSON AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SO START YOU REQUIRES OUR OFFICE TO EVALUATE THE PILOT PROGRAM AND THAT REPORT IS DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES. AS FAR AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE THINK IT WOULD BE PREMATURE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE A NEW INFLUX OF MONEY TO THIS PROGRAM WHEN THE CURRENT ONE HASN'T BEEN EVALUATED. YOU KNOW A LOT HAS CHANGED OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. OUR FINANCE MENTIONED THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS. IS X. INTENDED TO EXPAND. OPPORTUNITIES FOR REMOTE INSTRUCTION WE DO NOTE THAT ONLINE CLASSES ARE COMMONPLACE NOW SINCE THE PANDEMIC. THE STATE HAS CONTINUED TO INVEST HEAVILY IN LAPTOPS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT AND EXPAND BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE. HOLD OFF REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THIS YEAR. HAVE SOME TIME. TO LOOK INTO THIS PROGRAM AND HOW IT'S WORKING AS I MENTIONED THE LA ALWAYS GOING TO DO A REPORT ON THIS BY NEXT APRIL IT'S IN STATUTE. AND WE HOPE THE LEGISLATURE. WOULD FIND THIS REPORT USEFUL SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION COME BACK NEXT. SPRING OR NEXT JANUARY WITH THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOLLOWED BY C. D. E. AND THEN C. T. C. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN PARTY MEMBERS OF THE- EDUCATION BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE LISETTE NEVER AT EXECUTIVE VICE USER. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT PROPOSALS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OR A SPECIFIC TO THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES. I'M GONNA FOCUS ON ON THE TOPIC THAT THE ALLEY I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PARTNERSHIP. AS YOU MAY RECALL THIS WAS ESTABLISHED BY SENATE BILL FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR DODD AND AS WAS SHARED WAS CREATED- TO PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEACHER CREDENTIALING. THOSE WHO ALREADY- POSSESSED THE GREASY AND- WE'RE SERVING AND SHORT TERM- CAPACITIES- OR HAD LIMITED. ACCESS TO COMMISSION APPROVED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS THE FOCUS REALLY WAS I TEACHER SHORTAGES IN RURAL AREAS- AN ASTHMA SHARED WHEN THIS WAS AUTHORIZED THE INTENT WAS JUST TO PROVIDE CAPACITY. TO PROVIDE A SPACE SO THAT THESE TEACHERS DID NOT HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FURTHER EXACERBATE THE TEACHER SHORTAGE. GRANTS WERE PROVIDED TO THREE DISTRICTS FEATHER RIVER COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT MONTEREY PENINSULA AND YUBA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE PILOTS JUST CONCLUDED THEIR PLANNING PHASE SO AS A SHARED LIMITED INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT A LOT HAS CHANGED- CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGES NOT TEACHER CREDENTIALING PARTNERSHIP REALLY EXPOSE SOME POTENTIAL FOR A MORE FRUITFUL. A COLLABORATION- AND CREATING A TEACHER PIPELINE ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT COMEY CALLS COMPLAIN IMPORTANT ROLE INCREASING FUTURE WORK FORCE ESPECIALLY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD ADD. IN LEVERAGING OUR EXISTING CHILD DEVELOPMENT LABS AT CENTERS IN TEACHING WHAT LABS. ARE WE CAN PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT- BY PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS TO DIVERSITY AS WE SERVE THEIR GREATEST PROPORTION OF- DIVERSE STUDENTS ACROSS ALL OF HIGHER EDUCATION. I'M IN A MORE INTENTIONAL DESIGN OF THIS PROGRAM COULD REALLY HAVE- INCREASE RETENTION IMPROVING ACCESS TO QUALITY TEACHING AND LEARNING ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT HAVE LOW COLLEGE GOING RATES SO. WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING MORE THIS PROGRAM AND HOW WE CAN CREATE A MORE SPECIFIC PIPELINE THE TEACHER CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS- AND LEARNING FROM WHAT WHAT IS CHANGED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN THE EDUCATION FIELD- I'M WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU C. D. E. N. N. C. T. C. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND AGAIN I'M CHERYL COTTON DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE INSTRUCTION MEASUREMENT AND ADMINISTRATION BRANCH. OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND PRESENTED TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMAN WITH ME AGAIN IT'S KRISTIN CHRIS ALLEN FROM THE EDUCATOR EXCELLENCE AND EQUITY DIVISION. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S TEACHER SHORTAGE AS I MENTIONED IN MY PRIOR REMARKS NOT ONLY ARE WE FACING AN EDUCATOR WORKFORCE SHORTAGE THAT WAS EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN PRE K. THROUGH TWELVE PROGRAMS. WE ARE SEEING SCHOOLS STRUGGLING TO IMPLEMENT THESE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS DUE TO DIFFICULTIES IN HIRING QUALIFIED STAFF. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT TEACHERS ARE BEING ASKED TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL IMMENSE WORKLOAD AND NAVIGATE NEW CHALLENGES OF THIS NEW REALITY AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON WORK FORCE PROPOSALS THAT INCENTIVIZE. AND ASSIST TEACHER CANDIDATES ENTERING THE TEACHING PROFESSION SO SCHOOLS CAN RETAIN THEIR TALENT AND REDUCE TEACHER TURNOVER THAT IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC IN HIGH NEED SCHOOLS. FURTHER AS SCHOOLS BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL PRE KINDERGARTEN AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION WE NEED TO SUPPORT DIVERSE TEACHER PIPELINES TO HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING. FOR THESE IMPORTANT EARLY GRADES. WITH THIS THERE IS ALSO A NEED TO INCENTIVIZE AND SPARK INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. TO MORE QUICKLY ADAPTED SUPPORT COURSES AND PATHWAYS TO CREATE MORE CREDENTIALED AND PERMITTED TECHERS AND PARA EDUCATORS. AS THESE CANDIDATES GRADUATE FROM PROGRAMS WE NEED WAYS TO SUPPORT THEM AS THEY TRANSITION FROM GRADUATE PROGRAMS TO FULL TIME INSTRUCTION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE AND RELEVANT STATE ENTITIES AS WE DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE WORKFORCE PROPOSALS AND ARE READY TO HELP SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS IN ANY WAY WE CAN. THANK YOU AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN VERY BIG SEE SANDY WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. THE INVESTMENTS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REPRESENT AN ALIGNED EFFORT AT THE STATE REGIONAL LOCAL AND INDIVIDUAL LEVELS THEY CAN SUPPORT AND GROW THE EDUCATION WORKFORCE IN THE NEAR AND THE LONG TERM. I WOULD AGREE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST THAT THE STATE NEEDS A COORDINATED AUTHORITATIVE PLATFORM THAT ALL PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS CAN USE TO GUIDE THEM THROUGH A COMPLEX PROCESS OF BECOMING A TEACHER. I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT THIS IS NOT A ZERO SUM GAME. WELL IN ANY AND EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE COORDINATED. THEY TEACH CALIFORNIA DOT ORG SITE HOSTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS AN IMPORTANT BEACON THAT SHOULD HAVE A HOME AT THE STATE EDUCATION AGENCY. IT PROVIDES INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION IN A HIGHLY ENGAGING FORMAT FOR INTERESTED TEACHERS AND DOES NOT COMPETE WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING- OR EXCUSE ME THE COMMISSION OR THE CENTER FOR TEACHING CAREERS IN HOLDING THAT SPACE. MANY PEOPLE GO TO THE CD AS A FIRST STOP ON THEIR WAY TO CONSIDERING A CAREER IN TEACHER. A TEACHING SIMILARLY THE CALIFORNIA TEACH DOT WORK SITE HOSTED BY TELLER COUNTY PROVIDES INVALUABLE INFORMATION FOR JOB SEEKERS AND AGAIN INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO ENTER TEACHING. THE CENTER IS WELL POSITIONED TO ADVOCATE FOR THE TEACHING PROFESSION AND SERVE AS A COMPREHENSIVE JOB WORK. THE COMMISSION REMAINS HOWEVER THE LICENSING AGENCY ALL APPLICANTS MUST COME THROUGH THE COMMISSION IN ORDER TO BE CREDENTIAL. THE CAREER COUNSELORS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WOULD BE USED TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR NEEDS THE CALIFORNIA'S POTENTIAL AND CURRENT EDUCATORS HAVE FOR INFORMATION REGARDING EARNING A CREDENTIAL AND WORKING IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS. OVER THE LAST DECADE THE DEMAND FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THE COMMISSION'S CERTIFICATION DIVISION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CURRENTLY THE COMMISSION STAFF RESPOND TO APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND EMAIL AND ENGAGING FORD FIVE HUNDRED ONLINE CHATS WERE WEAK. THAT. IS AROUND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND EMAIL ONE FOURTEEN. OR FOR THOUSAND LIVECHATS TODAY- THAT- STAFFER ENGAGED WITH PROSPECTIVE OR CURRENT CREDENTIAL HOLDERS AROUND CREDENTIALING ISSUES. THIS IS LIKELY DUE IN PART TO THE EXPANSION OF OPTIONS AND PATHWAYS TO ME CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNDERGRADUATE INTEGRATED PROGRAMMING DEGREE PROGRAMS. INTERNSHIP ROUTES INTO TEACHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENCY AND CLASSIFIED STAFF PATHWAYS INTO TEACHING. WE ACCREDIT EIGHT EIGHTY ABOUT EIGHTY INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE OTHER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ELEAZAR AND ACROSS THESE PROGRAMS WE HAVE MAYBE A THOUSAND DIFFERENT PROGRAM PATHWAYS THE CANDIDATES CAN CHOOSE FROM IT IS A COMPLEX. ARRAY OF OPTIONS THESE NEW OPTIONS FOR PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS AS WELL AS THE RECENT EXPANSION OF OPTIONS FOR MEETING BASIC SKILLS AND SUBJECT MATTER REQUIREMENTS. MAKE THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING PREPARATION AND EARNING A CREDENTIAL MORE COMPLEX AND OFTEN CONFUSING FOR PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS. IN MANY WAYS IT WOULD BE EASIER TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BY ISSUING FEWER TYPES OF CREDENTIALS AND REDUCING THE OPTIONS FOR MEETING CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS. BUT MAINTAINING MULTIPLE ACCESSIBLE PATHWAYS INTO TEACHING IS KEY TO DIVERSIFYING AND GROWING THE RANKS OF OUR TEACHING FORCE. THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE GETTING FROM CANDIDATES SHIFT FROM HELP HOW DO I BECOME A TEACHER HOW DOES ANYONE BECOME A TEACHER. TO REALLY HOW CAN I BEST WHAT'S MY BEST PATHWAY FOR BECOMING A TEACHER GIVEN. MY UNIQUE SITUATION. POST CAREER K. WERE BE DEDICATED TO CREATING AN ONLINE SYSTEM THAT LEADS A PROSPECTIVE TEACHER THROUGH THEIR UNIQUE QUESTIONS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT WHEN NEEDED. IMPROVED ACCESS TO ONLINE INFORMATION ABOUT PATHWAYS OPTIONS FOR MEETING CREDENTIALS REQUIREMENTS PROGRAM AND GRANT OPPORTUNITIES COUPLED WITH DEDICATED STAFF ASSISTANCE WILL ASSIST ALL PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS IN NAVIGATING THE CREDENTIAL PROCESS. IN SHORT COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO BE THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND SUPPORT NAVIGATION WITH PRUDENTIAL ANALYST IN PREPARATION PROGRAMS AND FEEL. THE COMPLEXITIES OF RUNNING A CREDENTIAL. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU I'M GOING TO FIRST APP POSE A QUESTION THAT MR O'DONNELL. ASKED ME TO- TO LOOK AT HE HAD TO STEP OUT OF ITS WAY TO THE- TO THE TO THE FOUR YEAR PROGRAM DESIGN FROM THE TRADITIONAL FIVE YEAR DESIGN FOR ADDITIONAL PLANNING OF COURSE WE STARTED THIS A FEW YEARS AGO- THE QUESTION HE HAS IS THAT. WHY I HAPPEN TO BE RECEIVE MORE PRODUCT OUT OF THIS AND WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT PLANNING. SO AS THESE PROGRAMS TAKE SOME TIME TO DEVELOP- WHY HAVEN'T WE SEEN MORE PRODUCT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION I SUPPOSE IT IS THAT GOES TO THE CHOICES. THAT UNDERGRADUATE TEACHERS ARE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE ABOUT WHAT CAREER PATHWAYS THEY MIGHT LACK. LET ME REPHRASE THAT SO I THINK THIS WAS CREATED YEARS AGO SUSAN BUT HE HAD A BILL AUTHORIZING THIS AND SOME PILOTS AND WE STARTED THIS. AND WE'VE BEEN. IN THE PLANNING STAGES SO WHAT IS IT THAT THAT WE NEED TO DO TO REALLY MAKE THESE A REALITY AND NOT JUST. IF CAMPUSES MONEY TO PLAN FOR IT I THINK. IT'S NOT. SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE REPLICATED. WE'VE SEEN SOME FOR YOUR KIDS COLLEGES HAVE THIS SO I CAN WE JUST GET GOING ON MOVE IT AND HELP STUDENTS GRADUATE WITHIN FOUR YEARS ALLOWS MUCH STUDENT DEBT AND- THE DRESSER. TEACHER SHORTAGE ISSUE HEAD ON. IT'S EMIR MAY NOT BE A CASE OF IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME- SO AND CERTAINLY HAVING OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT HAVING RECRUITMENT AND OUTREACH EFFORTS ARE GOING TO YOU KNOW CREATE INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT THE OPTIONS THAT LIE BEFORE THEM- I THINK IF YOU DO USE A STEADY THE UNDERGRADUATE INTEGRATED SPACE WE FUNDED AND THE LAST GO ROUND WITH WITH GRANTS WE FUNDED FORTY ONE- GRANT OPPORTUNITIES AND DEVELOP PROGRAMS ACROSS FORTY ONE INSTITUTIONS THAT LEAD TO THE UNDERGRADUATE PATHWAYS- EIGHT. WE DO WE DO HAVE I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US AS WE LOOK AT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN THE MOVEMENT TOWARD TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN OF THE WE'RE LOOKING TO PROBABLY BRING ANOTHER ELEVEN THOUSAND TEACHERS INTO THE SYSTEM OF WHO WILL BE WORKING IN THAT TRANSITIONAL KERR KINDERGARTEN SPACE AND THE UNDERGRADUATE INTEGRATED PROGRAM ROUTE- IS IDEALLY SUITED FOR MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE BEGUN THEIR WORK WITH THE TWO YEAR PROGRAM- AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND CAN TRANSITION OR TRANSFER INTO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION. AND IF WE CAN CREATE THESE PROGRAM PATHWAYS FOR THEM THAT WOULD BE A READY- AND I THINK A VERY EFFICIENT PATHWAY FOR BRINGING THE EARLY CHILDHOOD WORKFORCE IN THAT BUT WE NEED TO BRING IN- SO BEYOND THAT I THINK THAT THE MOST OF THE TEACHERS WHO ARE COMING THROUGH AND I GETTING TEACHING CREDENTIALS ARE DOING SO THROUGH ADDITIONAL FIFTY YEAR PROGRAM STILL. OF WAR THROUGH INTERNET PROGRAMS ARE SEEING REAL GROWTH IN THE INTERNET SPACE HOPING TO SEE GROWTH OF THE RESIDENCY SPACE BUT THERE IS A PLACE FOR THIS PARTICULAR INFRASTRUCTURE THE UNDERGRADUATE PATHWAY IN- AND I THINK IN PARTICULAR FOR THE EARLY CHILDHOOD. WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED TO RECRUIT. OKAY AT NEXT QUESTION FOR YOU FOR YOU AGAIN- MERRY SANDY IS. DURING THE PRIOR YEAR WE HAD THAT WAVING OF THE- THE FEES THE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEES. AND WANT TO ASK YOU DO WE SEE AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITYIN APPLICATIONS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS WITH THE WAIVING THE FEE. I'D LIKE TO INVITE- ERR IN SCHOOL ARE DIRECTOR OF CERTIFICATION TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- AT WE DID SEE A- AN INCREASE IN OUR CREDENTIAL APPLICATIONS- THERE WAS AN APPROXIMATE TWENTY SIX POINT 8% INCREASE OVER THE EIGHT MONTH PERIOD WHEN THAT- COMMISSION OFFERED THE FEE WAIVER. AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AND THAT WOULD BE THE 202-020-2020 TWENTY ONE YEAR- BUT WE KNOW THAT WAS A COOL WITH YOUR SO WE DID LOOK BACK- TO BOTH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY FOR THAT SCENE EIGHT MONTH PERIOD. AND THERE WAS AN APPROXIMATE 13% INCREASE- OTHER APPLICATIONS OVER THAT TIME PERIOD WOW. OKAY SO DO YOU THINK THAT IT WAS WORTHWHILE THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE IT IN PERPETUITY. I'M I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN ATTRIBUTE ALL OF THAT INCREASE TO THE FEE WAIVER BUT I DO THINK IT WAS PART OF A MULTI PRONG- APPROACH THAT THE- GOVERNOR- PUT FORWARD TO SUPPORT THE INCREASE IN TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND SO I DO THINK THAT IT DID INCENTIVIZE MANY INDIVIDUALS TO- APPLY FOR TEACHER PREPARATION AND TO APPLY FOR ESPECIALLY SUBSTITUTE PERMITS WE DID SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SUBSIDY PERMITS OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. OKAY AN AMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF I MAY JUST CHIME IN AS WELL- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF THE FEE WAIVER AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE SOME- INVESTMENTS AND AROUND COULD THAT GUIDANCE COUNSELORS AS WELL AS THE- PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL PUTMORE AWARENESS AND OUT INTO THE FIELD ABOUT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF- YOU KNOW PROGRAMS TO GET INTO THE TEACHER'S BASE INCLUDING THAT THE WAIVER SO WE WOULD ANTICIPATE- DEMAND TO INCREASE IN FUTURE YEARS. OKAY BACK I ONE MORE QUESTION TO. MERRY SANDY WITH THE C. T. C. AB THIS ALSO IS IN THE AGENDA ARE THERE ANY OTHER PANDEMIC RELATED FLEXIBILITIES. OR CAPACITY THAT CDC WOULD RECOMMEND FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. ACTUALLY WE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITIES STATE THE INITIAL FLEXIBILITIES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE OF TWENTY TWENTY MANY OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH- LOWERING TO THE TESTING BARRIER. OF DUE TO TESTING CENTER CLOSURES AND THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR TOOK ACTION TO EXPAND OPTIONS FOR MEETING BASIC SKILLS REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS THE SUBJECT MATTER REQUIREMENTS. OF GREETING OPTION OPTIONS TO THE C. BEST TEST AND THE SEAS THAT PASSED ON AND THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO HAVE IT A VERY INTERESTING IMPACT THAT WILL BE TRACKING IN THE COMING YEARS- TO SEE HOW THOSE FLEXIBILITIES THAT WERE INITIALLY COVERT FLEXIBILITIES HAVE BECOME NOW. A NEW- SET OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO WENT INTO TEACHING- WE THINK IT IT'S TIME TO. LEARN FROM THE LESSONS OF KOBE AND PUT THE RIGHT STRUCTURES BACK IN PLACE BASED ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED- AND THAT'S. REALLY WHAT WE WOULD ADVISE AT THAT STAGE. OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER MEDINA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE INTEGRATED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM- AND QUESTIONS ON ON THAT- MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT IT WAS A AN INVESTMENT OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS THAT CORRECT YES THAT'S CORRECT AND WE HAVE A THIRTY THREE INSTITUTIONS OF PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. EIGHTEEN A CS USE TO UC'S AND SEVERAL- PRIVATE COLLEGES AND I DID THAT I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME BUT I DID SEE- FIGURES OF HOW MANY TEACHERS- THOSE INSTITUTIONS HAVE A CREDENTIAL TO MY RIGHT. SO THAT THEY THEY HAVE PRODUCED FEATURES THEY HAVE CREDENTIALED TEACHERS ALL THOSE ALL THOSE INSTITUTIONS. AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING YES RIGHT SO IT ALL THE MONEY HAS NOT JUST GONE INTO PLANNING. WELL LET ME JUST CLARIFY THAT THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT THAT WAS PROVIDED A WAS EXPLICITLY AND ONLY FOR PLANNING IT PROVIDED SUPPORT TO DESIGN A PROGRAM. AND NOW THE PROGRAM IS NOT FUNDED THE INTEGRATED PROGRAM IS NOT FUNDED TO RECRUIT OR DEVELOPMENT AND THE TEACHERS WHO. WHO CAME OUT OF THOSE PROGRAMS THERE THERE HAVE BEEN TEACHERS HAVE COME OUT OF THOSE PROGRAMS. THERE HAVE BEEN BUT THEY WERE NOT THEY DID NOT GET ANY OF THE GRANT FUNDING TO SUPPORT THEIR COMPLETION WAS ALRIGHT BUT THEY'RE THERE AND THEY DID GET SUPPORT IS THAT CORRECT THEY DID GET FINANCIAL SUPPORT. NOT NOT FROM THAT GRANT THAT THEY NOT I GOT IT FROM SOMEWHERE. THEY MAY HAVE GOTTEN. A FINANCIAL AID AND PARTICIPATED IN OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL AID PELL GRANTS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THERE WAS NO DESIGNATED. SUPPORT FUNDING FOR CANDIDATES TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATED PROGRAMS AT THAT TIME. CERTAINLY THEY HAVE ACCESS NOW TO THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT THAT COULD HELP THEM. ALONG THE WAY BUT THERE IS NO DESIGNATED FUNDING TO SUPPORT ENROLLED CANDIDATES IN AN INTEGRATED PROGRAM SO THE HUNDRED MILLION. THAT THAT- CALVARY SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION- INCREASE IN IN THAT PROGRAM- AND I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE MIGHT BE OUT THERE TO HELP ANSWER MY QUESTION A- INCREASE OF THE PROGRAM TO A HUNDRED MILLION OF THE INTEGRATED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM. DOES THAT ANY OF THAT MONEY GO DIRECTLY TO HELP OTHER STUDENTS GET THROUGH THE CREDENTIALING PROGRAM. IF WE WERE TO INCREASE IT TO A HUNDRED MILLION. I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I SEE THAT. RT I THINK IF I REMEMBER BUT YOU KNOW IF I MAY YES REMAINED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WHAT I WOULD SAY IT'S TWO TWO MEMBER MCCARTY'S EARLIER STATEMENT- CHAIRMAN PARTIES EARLIER STATEMENT TO THE EXTENT THERE STUDENTS FINISHING IN FOUR YEARS AND SAID A PIPE THROUGH AN INTEGRATED PROGRAM. THAT IS CERTAINLY A FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO THE STUDENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO COMPLETE IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION THEREBY NOT INCURRING ANOTHER YEAR OF YOU KNOW COST OF LIVING- NON TUITION CULTURE EVEN TUITION COSTS SO THERE IS A FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO STUDENTS FROM FINISHING THOSE PROGRAMS. IN FOUR YEARS INSTEAD OF FIVE THANK YOU BUT THE MONEY DOESN'T GO DIRECTLY TO IT'S IN ANY WAY TO SUPPORT THE STUDENT HIMSELF IN IN GRANT AND IT'S MONEY TO% THE INSTITUTION TO EXPAND THOSE PROGRAMS. THAT IS ACCURATE. BUT THANK YOU AND THAT THAT. THE HELPS CLARIFY- BUT IF STUDENTS WERE ABLE AS WE WERE JUST THEN SAYING AND BE ABLE TO FINISH IN FOUR YEARS INSTEAD OF FIVE- AND YOU HAVE A T. A CREDENTIAL WHEN THEY'RE FNISHED IN FOUR YEARS. INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTH YEAR WHICH IS I THINK- MISTER LEE'S POINT ABOUT WORKING FOR FREE- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I HAVE HERE- IN FRONT OF ME THAT IF WE DID INCREASE IT. WE COULD SEE AN INCREASE OF TWO UP TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS UGH COMING OUT OF THIS PROGRAM. SO I DO WANT TO SPEAK OUT IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING THE PROGRAM THE INTEGRATED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM. AND TO SEE THE INCREASE IN THE BUDGET FROM. TO THE HUNDRED MILLION. WOULD BE- WOULD I WOULD SUPPORT OKAY THANK YOU. PHILLY NOTED THEY ALL RIGHT WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE- OPEN AND PROCEED NO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A LEO AND CD. BY FINDING.

THANK YOU CITY. THE MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE COMMITTEE AGAIN I'M CHERYL COTTON DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE INSTRUCTION MEASUREMENT ADMINISTRATION BRANCH OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I'M PRESENTING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMAN AND WITH ME IS KRISTIN CHRIS ALLEN. FROM THE EDUCATOR EXCELLENCE AND EQUITY DIVISION. WE KNOW THAT ONGOING PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FOR EDUCATORS IS INTEGRAL. TO ATTAINING POSITIVE SCHOOL AND STUDENT OUTCOMES BUT IT TAKES ON NEW URGENCY WHEN CONSIDERING THE CONTEXT OF SCHOOLING. THE PANDEMIC FORCE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO TAKE ON NEW ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO ENSURE THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THEIR STUDENTS. WHILE ALSO RETHINKING WAYS TO APPROACH THIS STUDENT GAUGE MINT AND LEARNING ACCELERATION. AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAD TO CONTEND WITH IMMENSE STUDENT AND FAMILY TRAUMA AND STRESS. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND SUPPORT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE APPARENT I'M SORRY IMPERATIVE. FOR CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS A HIGH QUALITY PROFESSIONAL LEARNING SYSTEM DOES MORE TO HELP BUT DOES MORE THAN HELP. EDUCATORS MASTER DISCREET CONTENT AND INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES IT CONTRIBUTES A BROADER PROCESS OF TRANSFORMING PRACTICE AND HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. SCHOOL CULTURE AND CLIMATE LABOR MANAGEMENT DYNAMICS EDUCATOR EQUITY AND STUDENT AND EDUCATOR OUTCOMES. AND EFFECTIVE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING SYSTEM ATTENDS TO THE NEEDS OF SCHOOL LEADERS AND TEACHERS. SCHOOL LEADERS LEARN FROM EXPORT EXPERT MENTORS COACHES AND PEERS ABOUT HOW TO BECOME TRUE INSTRUCTIONAL LEADERS. THEY WERE COLLABORATIVE LEE WITH STAFF TO CREATE THE CULTURE AND STRUCTURES NECESSARY FOR CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL LEARNING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND STUDENT LEARNING NEEDS AND TO MAKE DATA TO SIFT DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS ABOUT CONTENT AND PEDAGOGY. AND ASSESS LEARNING IN A WAY THAT MAINTAINS HIGH EXPECTATIONS. EATERS ARE PROVIDED REGULAR PROTECTED AND SUPPORTED OPPORTUNITIES IN THEIR SCHEDULE TO MEET IN GRADE LEVEL OR CONTENT AREAS. A TEEN AREA TEAMS AND THEY SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. THESE LEARNING TEAMS FOLLOW A CYCLE OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT THAT INCLUDES EXAMINING STUDENT DATA TO DETERMINE AREAS OF GREATEST STUDENT AND EDUCATOR NEEDS IDENTIFYING CREATING LEARNING EXPERIENCES TO ADDRESS EDUCATOR NEEDS AS WELL. DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LESSONS AND ASSESSMENTS APPLYING NEW CLASSROOM STRATEGIES REFINING LESSONS AND ASSESSMENTS BASED ON NEW LEARNING REFLECTING ON THE IMPACT OF STUDENT LEARNING AND THEN REPEATING THE CYCLE AS NICHOLS EMERGE. IN RESPONSE TO THE TO THE DISPARITIES AND CHALLENGES EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC HIGH QUALITY PROFESSIONAL LEARNING SUPPORT EDUCATORS TO IMPLEMENT TRAUMA INFORMED AND HEALING CENTERS PRACTICES RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES CULTURAL RESPONSIVE AND ANTI RACIST TEACHING PRACTICES. RELATIONSHIP CENTERED SCHOOLS FAMILY ENGAGEMENT PRACTICES IN OTHER WHOLE CHILD PRACTICES WITHIN A SCIENCE OF LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK. COOL SCHEDULES INCLUDING DEDICATED INCLUDE DEDICATED DEDICATED PAID INDIVIDUAL PLANNING AND GROUP COLLABORATION TIME EDUCATORS HAVE ACCESS TO SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO SHARE RESOURCES AND KNOWLEDGE STAFF RETREATS AND TEAM BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP REBUILD RELATIONSHIPS AFTER THE ISOLATION OF DISTANCE LEARNING. AND PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT STAFF AND HEALTH AND WELL BEING. AND SOME ARE EDUCATORS DESERVE HIGH QUALITY PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT SUPPORT THEM TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE STRUCTURES AND CONTENT WE NOW LEAD TO POSITIVE OUTCOMES AMID THE PRESSING NEEDS. OF THIS EXCEPTIONAL TYPE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. I'M JOINED WITH KRISTEN CHRIS ALLEN FRUIT FROM OUR EDUCATOR EXCELLENCE AND EQUITY DIVISION WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. RIGHT. THANK YOU JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION IS THIS IS A QUESTION. YOU GOT THAT. GROWING PAINS. ARE THERE ANY EDUCATOR INDUCTION OR MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS- THAT ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY FUNDED TO ALL ELEAZAR. AT THE BOTTOM PART OF THE FINANCE- FINANCE RECOGNIZES THAT EVERYBODY WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION FOR WHAT IT MEANS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY FUNDED- I'LL NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT TEACHER INDUCTION AND- PROMOTE MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. OKAY. THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR THIS ITEM NO ONE ELSE IS HERE SO PROCEED TO ISSUE NUMBER HOLD IT OPEN WELL THAT OPEN TILL OUR MAY REVISE HEARING ISSUE NUMBER FIVE CAREER AND COLLEGE READINESS. AND L. A. O. CD E. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE OFFICE OF. PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. OKAY WE'LL START WITH L. A. L. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BRUCE MICHAEL FEATHERS WITH THE ILLEGAL. A PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CT RELATED ISSUES AND THE STATES KEEP ON FIFTY PROGRAMS. OF A BEGIN BY SHARING A FEW STATISTICS ABOUT GRADUATION AND COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. THE LEADERS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO SO THAT THE CALIFORNIA'S FOR YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES. ARE ABOUT 86% WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. ALL OF THE STATE'S GRADUATE 54% ENROLLED IN COLLEGE AFTER GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL. OF THOSE ENROLLING IN COLLEGE FIFTY FIVE PERCENT- ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE 30% ENROLLED IN EITHER UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OR THE USE USE USE YOUR SYSTEM. NOW WITH THE REMAINING 50% ENROLLED EITHER OUT OF STATE OR PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. OF THE STATE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ABOUT HALF COMPLETED THE COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSEWORK REQUIRED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FRESHMAN ADMISSION TO UC AND CSU SYSTEMS. KNOWN AS THE A. THREE G. SERIES SUBGROUPS FOR EXAMPLE 40% OF GRADUATES WERE LOW INCOME- COMPLETED THIS A THREE G. SERIES. AND ONLY 12% OF FOSTER YOU'VE WELCOME TO H. TWO G. SERIES. WHAT IS IT AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET INCLUDED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. FOR THE R. EIGHT THREE G. COMPLETION IMPROVEMENT GRANT PROGRAM. WHICH WAS AIMED AT ON INCREASING IF THE REGION COMPLETION RATES FOR FOSTER YOUTH LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AND ENGLISH LEARNERS. AS PART OF THE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THIS REPORT VARIOUS L. COMES. TO THE STATE WHICH IS THEN DISPLAYED ON THE PUBLIC'S WEBSITE ON A SCHOOL DASHBOARD. UNDER THE STATE'S ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE POOR PERFORMANCE. FOR ONE OR MORE STUDENTS OF GROUP BASED ON THE INDICATORS MUST EXAMINE. ON THE REAL ISSUES AND ACCESS SUPPORT TO HELP THEM TO IMPROVE. THE US COULD ASK FOR INPUT ON INCLUDES A VARIETY OF DATA INCLUDING STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES GRADUATION RATES IN SUSPENSION RATES. ANOTHER KEY INDICATOR IS THE COLLEGE AND CAREER INDICATOR WHICH COMBINES ALL INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENTS. OF COURSE COMPLETION CITY PROGRAM PARTICIPATION. AND TEST SCORES OF THE INDICATOR ALLOWS MULTIPLE WAYS FOR THE DISPLAY FOR STUDENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED OR PROPORTION PREPARED. OF SUCH AS ON LOW COMPLETING FIRST USE YOU AT HOME AND YOU SEE REQUIREMENTS- PARTICIPATING IN CITY PATHWAYS PROGRAM. A COMPUTER AP COURSEWORK SO BEING PREPARED WOULD BE IN THAT THEY- COMPLETED TWO OF THOSE CRITERIA AND APPROACHING REPAIRS JUST COMPLETING ONE AND NOT PREPARED IS- NOT. COMPLETING ANY OF THOSE INDICATORS. MMHM AND 209044% OF THE STATE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WORD AGAIN PREPARED 17% WERE APPROACHING PREPARED. AND 39% WERE NOT PREPARED. AS A FIGURE ON PAGE THIRTY ONE OF YOUR AGENDA SHOWS. THERE ARE OFTEN GAPS IN THEIR OWN COLLEGE READINESS. ABOUT RACIAL SUBGROUPS. MMHM THE STATE HAS TO K. TWELVE FIFTY PROGRAMS VIA A CRITICAL EDUCATION A FDERAL GRANT ONE OF THE FEW TOOK PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE CITY AND THE K. TOOLS FROM WERE FIRST PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE CCC FERIA CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON THE PROGRAMS BOTH PROVIDE COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO SCHOOLS WITH DIFFERENT FORMULAS TO CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS- FIFTY PROGRAM FIVE AND BOTH PROGRAMS HAVE A LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENT OF. TWO DOLLARS FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR BEEN THINKING- WHERE THE CITY THE FIFTY PROGRAM IS. INTENDED TO COVER A BROADER RANGE OF GOALS. BEYOND FOR FIRST TRAINING SUCH AS STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND CAREER EXPLORATION. THE K. TWELVE FROM OUR FIRST PROGRAM IS PRIMARILY INTENDED TO ADDRESS REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. AND CORKER SCHOOLS TO PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BOTH PROGRAMS WERE FUNDED AT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING ON THE LAST FISCAL YEAR BUT AT THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. DOUBLED THE FUNDING FOR C. TWO TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION- IN ADDITION TO THE K. TWELVE FIFTY PROGRAMS. THERE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROGRAMS. THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THE PROVIDE SUPPORT TO EXISTING K. TWELVE PROGRAMS. THAT PROMOTE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS THE STATE PROVIDES. TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOR THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR OUR FIRST PROGRAM. WHICH SHARE THE SAME REGIONAL STRUCTURE WITH THE KIDS WILL STRONGER FOR PROGRAM. ON BOTH PROGRAMS ARE REQUIRED TO FOCUS ON- REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS WITH THE CABLE PROGRAM INTENDED TO.

CALLOUS ON THE DIVISION DIRECTOR OF THE CAREER COLLEGE TRANSITION DIVISION AT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TODAY I'M- HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMAN. THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION CENTER GRANT PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER A THREE YEAR SPAN. AND ACTED AS A BRIDGE FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO SUPPORT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS UNTIL THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WAS FULLY FUNDED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. THE C. TAG IN THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAMS WERE EACH ALLOCATED A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDS THE DISSIDENT AN ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION WAS PROVIDED ANNUALLY TO ESTABLISH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS IN WORKFORCE PATHWAY QUARTERS IN SUPPORT OF BOTH STATE INITIATIVES. THE C. TAKE AND K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY. THE CITY IS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE K. TWELVE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA THREE COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT C.

A. IS BASED ON A FORMULA WITH NINE VARIABLES THAT INCLUDE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE ALONG WITH EIGHT POSSIBLE. POSITIVE CONSIDERATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. L. A. ALLOCATION IS THE LESSER OF THE FORMULA CALCULATION. OR THE TWO TO ONE MATCH. AS A TOTAL FUNDS AVAILABLE INCREASE THE MATCH RATIO OF TWO TO ONE LIMITS THE ABILITY FOR C. D. E. TO DISTRIBUTE ALL OF THE AVAILABLE FUNDS. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH THE ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE THERE WAS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE WITH A ONE TO ONE MATCH. AND CD WAS ABLE TO ALLOCATE. ALL OF THOSE FUNDS. CD IS GRATEFUL FOR THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR THE CG PARTICULAR EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM.

THIS YEAR TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN APPLICATIONS WERE AWARDED ACROSS EIGHT REGIONS WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO EXPAND THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROGRAM MEETING THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL ALIGNMENT BETWEEN OUR WORK- AND EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION AT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT IS THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS BARBARA CAN'T MINOR AND THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION I AM HAPPY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REGIONAL K. SIXTEEN EDUCATION COVERAGE GRANT PROGRAM WITH YOU TODAY. ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION IS A MINISTER IN THE COMPETITIVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. REGIONAL K. SIXTEEN EDUCATION CLUBBERS GRANT PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET ACTS. THE PSC WAS SELECTED DUE TO OUR DECADES LONG EXPERIENCE AND ADMINISTERING THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM AND OUR FAMILIARITY WITH THE K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT POPULATION. ACTUALLY ALSO AUTHORIZED THE USE OF A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. AND THE FOUNDATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WAS SELECTED AS THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR AND IS ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE PSC ON THE ON THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. FOUNDATION CCC BRINGS A STRONG BACKGROUND WITH HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AT ALL LEVELS AS WELL AS BACKGROUND GRANT PROGRAMS AND THEY HAVE PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH CONGRESS AS WELL. GENERAL STATUS ON THE PROGRAM AND PROGRAM THAT REACHES READ TO DATE THERE HAVE BEEN TWO INFORMATIONAL WEBINARS THE FIRST OCCURRED IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THIS WAS A- A BROADER OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM GOALS. AND THE SECOND OCCURRED ON FEBRUARY FIFTH AND IN FEBRUARY THIS WAS AN EXPANSION OF THAT OVERVIEW AND ALSO SHARE THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE PROGRAM WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO SEEK FEEDBACK ON AND THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. THIS DEBATE TO THE CREATION OF A SHARED INTEREST LISTS SO THAT MEMBERS. OF THE POTENTIAL PARTNERS FOR THE COLLABORATIVE COULD REACH OUT TO OTHERS IN THEIR REGION TO CONNECT AND SEE IF THERE WAS SOME INTEREST IN JOINING FORCES AND SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION. THERE IS ALSO AN ADDITIONAL WEAPON ARE SCHEDULED FOR APRIL EIGHTH FROM TEN THIRTY TO ELEVEN THIRTY AND THIS WEAPON ARE IS GOING TO WALK THE INTERESTED APPLICANTS THE ROOM LOOKS. THE ACTUAL GRANT APPLICATION ITSELF. SO THE PROGRAM THAT WEBSITE IS LIVE IN ITS NEW FORMAT OKAY YES HE HAD ESTABLISHED A TEMPORARY HOLD A SPOT FOR THE PROGRAM AND THAT INITIAL STAGES FALCONS WERE GETTING STARTED. BUT WE HAVE TRANSITIONED OVER TO THAT NEW WEBSITE AND ALL NEW INFORMATION IS NOW FOUND AT. W. W. W. DOT K. SIXTEEN COLLABORATIVE DOESN'T WORK. AND IT DOES INCLUDE A LIST SERVE AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS DOCUMENT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROGRAM DESIGN AND- ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE OPTED TO USE THE ESTABLISHED REGIONS THAT ALIGN WITH THE SURF REGIONS THE COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE FUND REGIONS. IT MADE SENSE TO LINK UP WITH THIS COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM WITH SIR BECAUSE OF THE SIMILARITIES. FOR THE TWO PROGRAMS. YEAH THE INTENT OF THE- PROGRAM IN TO ANSWER. REGIONAL EDGE. OR WORKFORCE. AS A TO MAKE A SICK. IMPACT ON THE REGIONAL ECONOMY SO IT'S IMPRACTICAL TO KEEP THE REGIONAL BOUNDARIES AT THE SAME FOR THOSE TWO PROGRAMS. WE DO ANTICIPATE HAVING ONE AWARD HER SERVE REGION. AND THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED IN TWO PHASES AND THE FIRST PHASE IS COMING UP VERY SOON AND THIS IS GOING TO BE. AND WE'RE CALLING IT OUR FAST TRACK THING IS THIS IS FOR THE MORE ESTABLISHED COOPERATIVES WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY READY TO GET STARTED WITH THIS GRANT FUNDING. SO THIS IS THE PHASE ONE GROUP AND THE APPLICATION FILING PERIOD FOR THIS GROUP ACTUALLY BEGINS NEXT WEEK ON APRIL FIRST AND CLOSES ON MAY SECOND. GRANT AWARDS WILL BE ANNOUNCED ON MAY TWENTIETH AND THERE IS A SELF ASSESSMENT TOOL ON THE NEW WEBSITE THAT APPLICANTS CAN USE TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE A GOOD FIT. FOR THE PHASE ONE APPLICATION PROCESS. DURING THE M. B. DURING THE DISCUSSIONS THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENTS AND IT IT BECAME. BECAME EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE A LOT LOT OF POTENTIAL PARTNERS FOR THE COLLABORATIVE'S THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN THIS EFFORT BUT MAYBE WE'RE NOT QUITE READY TO GO THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE PARTNERSHIPS IN PLACE AND WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT AND THE STUDENTS SO THAT PROGRAM DESIGN INCORPORATED. A PHASE TWO FOR FUNDING AND THE SECOND PHASE INCLUDED AN INITIAL PLANNING GRANTS AS WELL AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR AN IMPLEMENTATION GRANT LATER ON SO THE FAMOUS TO PLANNING GRANTS THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL BE LAUNCHED ON SEPTEMBER FIRST OF THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND AWARDS WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANT PERIOD WILL FOLLOW ABOUT A YEAR LATER SO SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE APPLICATION WILL BE LAUNCHED IN AWARDS WILL E ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS FOR BOTH PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER COLLABORATIVE AND THE PLANNING GRANTS WILL RANGE FROM A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT DIFFERENT COLLABORATORS WILL HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS WITHIN THOSE FUNDING. OF PRINTERS. IN JUST A FEW ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE- THIS WE DO HAVE A GRANT AGREEMENT AND- DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS REGULAR REPORTING PERIODS. AFTER AUDITS AND CHECK INS RELATED TO BOTH EXPENDITURES ON PROGRESS. AND WE EXPECT SOME CASE STUDIES TO COME-OUT OF THIS AS WELL AS OTHER TYPES OF DATA COLLECTION. AND IN CLOSING WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE APPLICATIONS COME IN VERY SOON WE HAVE. SEEN A LOT OF INTEREST SO FAR ACROSS THE STATE AND- ALL AREAS SO WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THE APPLICANTS PUT FORTH IN THERE AND PROPOSALS. AND WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SO FAR AND- RELATED TO THIS EXCITING PROGRAM. AND WITH THAT I AM AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU. THIS IS A UNIQUE PROGRAMMING CATHERINE AT THE END LAST YEAR NOT. CERTAIN THE- VIA THE MERITS OF THIS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE BUT- YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON TO OTHER STUFF. I'M I THINK THE ONE ISSUE THAT THAT WE ARE CONVINCED APPEAR ON THE BODY AT. DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE TWO. CD PROGRAM HAS A GREAT LOVE FOR C. T. AND WE'RE NOT CERTAIN WHY WE HAVE TO PROGRAM SO. AND MR DONNELLY STRONG OPINIONS ON THIS AND PENDING LEGISLATION AGAIN. WE HAVE HEARD FROM LA- WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. AND THE PROGRAM CDP WHICH WE- STRONGLY SUPPORT AND DOUBLE OUR STATE SUPPORT FOR LAST YEAR AND HAS ON GOING DOWN TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN PLANNING MAKE AN ONGOING. PRIORITY DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE TWO PROGRAMS WE CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE. FROM A RECORD BROUGHT THE LEADS WE DON'T **** WITH WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION- ON THIS ISSUE AND THEY DO THE PROGRAMS DO SIR SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- GOLD HERE SO I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE IS YOU KNOW TO WHAT LEVEL OF- YOU KNOW AND INFINITE. PUBLIC ON BOTH THE MINERAL DUNFORD DOUBLES PREFERENCE FOR THIS THE TECH PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT IN TERMS OF DESIGNING THAT PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE. THEY HAVE TO BE VERY SPECIFICALLY ALIGNED TO THE I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE A RECCO YOU DON'T HAVE ONE FOR US TODAY BUT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE GOING FORWARD IN. CALIFORNIA YOUR EDGAR KING FOR THE DAY IN CITY. WOULD YOU HAVE TO COMPANION THINGS ARE. FOCUSED ON. ON ONE PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN MAXIMIZE. WITH REGARD TO GET DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU THINK THAT THESE. CALLS ARE CLEAR BUT YOU'RE CLEARLY GETTING DIFFERENT THINGS FROM BOTH PROGRAMS THAT YOU LIKE- AND IF YOU DO THEM THAT MAYBE THERE'S A REASON TO HAVE THEM SEPARATE BUT- IF THE PROGRAMS ARE. ESSENTIALLY SERVING FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU FIND OUT THAT. ON THE GROUND DISTRICTS ARE USING THEM FOR SIMPLY THE FAME PROGRAM BUT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND DOUBLE THE APPLICATIONS THEN YOU'D HAVE MORE WE WOULD HAVE MORE CONCERNS. A POSITIVE FOR SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THAT LEVEL THE DIVIDING EVERYTHING THAT'S- OUT OF THE WAY WE WOULD THINK ABOUT- DECIDING WHETHER YOU THINK THAT. IT'S WORTH HAVING THE TWO PROGRAMS THAT I AGREED IN GENERAL AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS IS. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THAT DISTRICTS HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT RULES AND UNDERSTAND HOW EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS WORK. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THERE IS CLARITY AND CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE GETTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT HERE AND THAT IT MAKES. THERE'S LIKE A CLEAR CLEAR CASE FOR WHY NOT WHY THAT SHOULD OCCUR. OKAY AND THEN FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PERSPECTIVE. WE HEARD FOR YEARS THAT THEY NEEDED ONGOING NOT JUST ONE TIME TO DO PROPER PLANNING. AND DO WE THINK THAT SINCE WE NOW HAVE HAD ONGOING THAT ALL DISTRICTS HAVE STEPPED UP AND BASICALLY BROUGHT BACK THEIR PROGRAMS THAT MAYBE DIDN'T. EXIST DURING THE RECESSION. YES I THINK THAT'S- WHERE. YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN THESE PROGRAMS WERE DEVELOPED I THINK FROM. YOU KNOW THIS WAS ALL. COMING THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALFIE FF THERE WAS A- ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROVIDED FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL FOR HIGH SCHOOL. EIGHTY EIGHT WITH THE IDEA THAT THAT WOULD BE USED IN PART FOR. THE D. E. IN THESE PROGRAMS WERE WERE CONTINUED IN PART BECAUSE THERE MIGHT NEED TO BE SOME FUNDING TO KEEP THE PROGRAM GOING. MIGHT BE NEED SOME ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. ARE YOU MIGHT WANT TO FUN WITH THESE GRANTS. I THINK OUR OFFICE IN GENERAL HAS TENDED TO. RECOMMEND YOU KNOW. USING VLC OF ADD ON OR ELSE IF I PROCESS AS A WAY TO FIND T. T. E. SO I THINK. IT IT IT DOES SEEM LIKE AT THIS POINT IF YOUR CONCERN WAS. GETTING YOU KNOW. PROGRAMS GOING AWAY ANY PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED OVER TIME ADDING THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES LIKE. YOU KNOW. IF THEIR INTERESTS ARE AND NEED FOR. ADDITIONAL START UP. FUNDING FOR NEW PROGRAMS TO BE DEVELOPED. OKAY ENDED THAT CHARACTER MANY COLLEGES MUST NEVER AT ONE IN- RESPOND THEN. WHY WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TWO PROGRAMS IN YOUR UNIQUE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. SIMILARLY WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION THE ONLY THING THAT WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THAT- AS YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BOTH IN THE BUDGET AND POLICY- IF THE LEGISLATURE WORD TO TRANSITION THE PROGRAM WOULD. THAT WE'D REQUEST THAT IT BE DONE BEFORE THE FIFTH ROUND OF GRANTS BEGAN IN AUGUST AND DID THAT THE FULL PROGRAM TRANSITION AS YOU KNOW THE CANCERS OFFICE PROVIDES THE CAPACITY FOR THESE GRANTS THAT ESSENTIALLY ALL GO. TO K. TWELVE SO WE ARE SHOULDERING THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION WE DO SEE THE BENEFITS AND ALIGNING- THOSE TRANSITIONS FROM ME OR FROM K. TWELVE TO- TO A HIGHER READ- AS ALL OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS THAT RECEIVED GRANTS AND FUNDING THE TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN. DO YOU HAVE A HIGHER AND PARTNER AT THE WORK CLOSELY IN THE DESIGN. BUT IF- THAT LEGISLATURE WORD TO DESIRE THIS TO LIVE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE AGAIN WE WOULD. ASK THAT THE FULL PROGRAM BE MOVED AND NOT JUST PARTS OF IT. OKAY THANK YOU MR DONALD. I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT I THINK WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY COVERED I JUST WALKED IN I WAS IN ANOTHER MEETING I THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND THAT IS JUST THAT WE SHOULD COMBINE THE TWO- THE STRONG WORK FORCE SLIDE BACK UP SLIDE OVER TO SEE WHERE IT BELONGS IF YOU LOOK AT THE AUDIT WE SHOULD ENSURE CODE IT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THERE HAS NOT WORKED- AND I KNOW YOU'RE AN OVERWORKED IT I KNOW THAT. THE CHANCES OFFICES AN OVERWORKED OFFICE I GET IT- BUT I JUST THINK FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- PUTTING THE STRONG WORK FORCE OVER IN CD IS A MUCH BETTER THING FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WITH THAT BACK TO YOU MR. S. THANK YOU WILL HOLD WELL THIS IS SHE WAS JUST INFORMATIONAL LAST YEAR'S. BUDGET AND ONGOING. A C. T. PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA AT ISSUE NUMBER FIVE IS RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSALS RELATE TO COLLEGE AND CAREER READY. I'M SORRY. THE ISSUE SIX YES THANK YOU AND WE'LL HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIE LCD AND THEN THE CHANCES OFFICE ONCE AGAIN. THE CHAIR OUT CHRIS FERGUSON WITH ART IN FINANCE- ALL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS RELATIVELY BRIEF Q. AND HE HAS TO EXPAND THE OFFERING OF SEAMLESS PATHWAYS FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE AND CAREER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PATHWAYS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY IN THE FIELDS OF TECHNOLOGY HEALTH CARE EDUCATION AND CLIMATE RELATED FIELDS- THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GOLDEN STATE PATHWAYS PROGRAM. THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED FOR TWO TYPES OF AWARDS A PLANNING- AWARD AND AN IMPLEMENTATION AWARD- FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE WOULD BE AVAILABLE THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING A GRANT UNDER THE- GOLDEN STATE PATHWAYS PROGRAM A RECIPIENT WOULD COMMIT TO. IDENTIFYING LONG TERM RESOURCES TO SUSTAIN THE ONGOING OPERATIONAL COSTS OF THE- PATHWAYS PROGRAMS. THAT ARE DEVELOPED- THERE'S A LOT A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO SUPPORT. AND EXPAND ACCESS TO DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS- WHICH WE KNOW FROM RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE WHEEL HEALTH CENTER AT UC DAVIS- AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA- DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS HAVE. SHOWN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF INCREASING OUR PATHWAYS. FOR STUDENTS TO ENTER COLLEGE FROM OR UNIVERSITY FROM HIGH SCHOOL- WITH GREATER PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN. A DUAL ENROLLMENT COURSES ULTIMATELY ENROLLING IN COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY- ADDITIONALLY OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE SET THE SPACE THAT ARE NOTED IN THE AGENDA INCLUDE A TWO MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT TO SUPPORT THE- AGRICULTURAL CATION- EDUCATION- INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THERE IS- TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME TO SUPPORT THE- PATHWAYS GRANT PROGRAM FOR HIGH SKILLED CAREERS WHICH IS- ADDED AN INNOVATION OF AN EXISTING A ONE TIME GRANT PROGRAM PREVIOUSLY FUNDED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR- WE PROPOSE. A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHCARE ROTATIONAL- PATHWAYS THROUGH ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS. ON ENGLISH LEARNER PROFICIENCY COURSES AND PATHWAYS- AND WITH THAT I WILL. TURN IT OVER TO. ALL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU. HELLO. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU AGAIN- CHAIRMAN OR THE COMMITTEE I GOT FED UP WITH THE ILLEGAL WE HAVE PUBLISHED A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON OUR WEBSITE A LITTLE KEEPER COMMENTS HERE- TO A HIGH LEVEL OF FOCUS AND TO SECURE KEY ISSUES. REGARDING THE GOLDEN STATE PATHWAYS PROPOSAL OUR FIRST CONCERN IS THAT IT WOULD ADD MORE COMPLEXITY TO THE STATE'S APPROACH TO FUNDING COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS THE PROPOSAL HAS SEVERAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE STATE TO VISIT TO EXISTING HIGH SCHOOL CTE PROGRAMS HOWEVER THE SET THE PROGRAM HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS HAVING A PATHWAYS BE ALIGNED WITH USE YOU AND YOU SEE A COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH INTEGRATED SUPPORT SERVICES. THERE COULD BE BENEFITS TO ENCOURAGING SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT SCHOOL PROGRAMS OF THIS TYPE AS THEY CAN PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH GREATER OPTIONS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE SCHOOLS OFTEN OPERATING PROGRAMS WITH THREE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING AND THREE DIFFERENT PROGRAM RULES THIS CAN MAKE IMPLEMENTING WELL L. PROGRAMS A MINISTRY TO FLEE AND FISCALLY CHALLENGING FOR US SCHOOLS. OUR SECOND CONCERN IS THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSAL HAS CLEAR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE TYPES OF PATHWAYS THE PROGRAM GRANT RECIPIENTS MUST DEVELOP AND ALSO REQUIRES THEM TO SUBMIT OVER BLESSED OF OUTCOME DATA COLLECTION CRITICAL DETAILS AND LEAVES A FEW A KEY DECISIONS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AND THE BOARD OF EDUCATION SUCH AS- GRANT AMOUNTS AND ALLOWABLE USES OF THE FUNDING WITHOUT THESE DETAILS IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS. THE PROGRAM'S POTENTIAL BENEFITS. A TO THESE. WERE RECOMMEND THE- REQUEST MINISTER PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THE PROPOSALS FROM ALL. PARTS OF MY REVISION MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO GENDER. A FULL LIST OF OUR QUESTIONS IS ON YOUR AGENDA STARTING ON PAGE FORTY THREE. REGARDING THE DORMER PROPOSALS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT THE MINISTRATION HAS NOT IDENTIFIED WHAT PROBLEMS CURRENTLY EXIST. WITH ONE WOMAN IN PARTICULAR DEMONSTRATION IS NOT SPECIFY WHAT BARRIERS LEDS CURRENTLY FAITH. AND- IMPLEMENTED TO ENROLLMENT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE FOR THE- A COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS PROGRAMS BECAUSE HE KEPT PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR BOTH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE ENROLLMENT FOR THE C. CAP PROGRAMS HAVE GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY OVER RECENT YEARS EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC AGAINST THE OVERALL TREND OF THE MOMENT THE CLIENT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ON THE LAST CONCERN WE HAVE A PLACE TO BOTH OF THE PROPOSALS. ON WHAT IS THAT THEY BOTH DO LITTLE TO TARGET FUNDING TO SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT THE MOST. THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE PRIORITY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH AT LEAST HALF OF THE STUDENT POPULATION CONSISTING OF ENGLISH LEARNERS AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AMONG OTHER METRICS SUCH AS HAVING HIGHER THAN AVERAGE DROPOUT REEF. BUT BASED ON JUST ON THAT NUMBER OF- INVESTORS A LOCUM STUDENTS WE FIND THAT AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR. PRIORITY SUCH A BROAD DEFINITION IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON STUDENTS THAT COULD MOST BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. IF THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS A PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER OTHER WAYS TO TARGET FUNDING TO SCHOOLS. AND STUDENTS WITH THE HIGHEST NEED. OF FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER INCREASING THE THRESHOLD FOR PRIORITY FOR DISTRICTS WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THEIR STUDENT POPULATION- BEING LOW COMPARING MR STUDENTS. OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO REQUIRE GRANTEES TO DEMONSTRATE. THAT THEY WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS EQUITABLY ACROSS VARIOUS SCHOOLS FAITH. AND IN A WAY THAT IS TARGETED TO BENEFIT STUDENT SUBGROUPS WITH LOWER COLLEGE AND CAREER. OUTCOMES I'LL NOW TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ALLELE OF POSTING HOW OFTEN. THANK YOU- OSTEEN HOUSE WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I WILL TALK ABOUT TWO ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE INTRODUCED THAT'S THE PATHWAY GRANT PROGRAM FOR HIGH SKILLED CAREERS AND HEALTH CARE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION THROUGH THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM. AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES ON PAGE THIRTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE PATHWAYS GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS FORMALLY KNOWN IN STATUTE AS THE CALIFORNIA STEM PATHWAYS GRANT PROGRAM. BUT JUST TO MAKE THE CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSALS YOU'VE JUST HEARD THE PATHWAY GRANT PROGRAM IS REALLY A UNIQUE TYPE OF DUAL ENROLLMENT IS DESIGNED TO HAVE A CLOSE CONNECTION INDUSTRY YOU HAVE COHORTS OF STUDENTS START IN NINTH GRADE AND THEY RECEIVE INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT. SO THEY CAN PROGRESS AT THEIR OWN PACE AND THEN THE PROGRAM. ONLY MATES IN A ASSOCIATES DEGREE THE LEGISLATURE IS BEING ASKED TO FUND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN THESE PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET YEAR THEY'D HELP THE LEGISLATURE MAKE A MORE INFORMED DECISION ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE LEGISLATURE REALLY WOULD BENEFIT FROM A STATUS UPDATE FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON HOW THE CURRENTLY FUNDED PROGRAM IS GOING. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ASK THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOR INFORMATION SUCH AS HOW MANY STUDENTS INITIALLY STARTED THESE GRANT FUNDED PROGRAMS HOW MANY A COUPLE YEARS AND ARE STILL ENROLLED BUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STUDENTS WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS ARE THEY MAKING TOWARD THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND GETTING COLLEGE CREDITS. AND I UNDERSTAND IS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS COMPILED SOME INITIAL DATA. OF FROM THE GRANTEES LEGISLATURE COULD USE THIS IN SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO. THE SIDE AND WEIGH WHETHER TO FUND THIS PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET YEAR OR TO USE THE MONEY FOR OTHER- HIGHER PRIORITY PURPOSES. WITH REGARD TO HEALTH CARE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION THROUGH THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM THIS IS AIMED AT ENGLISH LEARNERS. THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARD IN A PRIOR HIGHER READ OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. MEETING ABOUT HOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT HAS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. NOW ENROLLMENT IN ADULT EDUCATION WHICH FOCUS OF FOCUSES ON PRE COLLEGIATE LEVEL INSTRUCTIONAL WORKFORCE TRAINING. HAS ACTUALLY DECLINED EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY ENROLLMENT DATA FOR THE ADULT SCHOOLS THROUGH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE NON CREDIT PROGRAMS SHOWS THAT. ADULT EDUCATION SERVING ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS FEWER. THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO DECLINE OF ABOUT A THIRD OF STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE SERVING. NOW BASED ON PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ADULT EDUCATION ROMANCES RECOVERING SLIGHTLY IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUT PROVIDERS ARE STILL WELL BELOW THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEY WERE SERVING- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. NOW THOUGH ENROLLMENT IS DOWN PROVIDERS FUNDED BY THE STATE'S ABILITY CATION PROGRAM ARE ACTUALLY- HAD NOT SEEN A REDUCTION IN THE FUNDING LEVEL. THAT'S BECAUSE IN STATUTE. THE CREATED THE ADULT EDUCATION CATEGORICAL PROGRAM. THE PROVIDERS GET THIS MONEY REGARDLESS OF ENROLLMENT SO IN THE CURRENT YEAR THEY'RE GETTING FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ACTUALLY WHICH IS AN INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR SO AS A RESULT PROVIDERS LIKELY WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT- INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY NEXT YEAR TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS WETHERBY IN ENGLISH A SECOND LANGUAGE IN THE HEALTH CARE TRAINING OR OTHER TYPES OF ADULT EDUCATION INSTRUCTION. WITH US RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND INSTEAD RE DIRECT FUNDS TO HIGHER PRIORITY- PURPOSES IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND HAVE THE ADULT ED PROVIDERS SERVE THESE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS IF THEY CAN ENROLL THE STUDENTS USING THE FUNDS THEY ALREADY HAVE. GIVEN ALL THE EXCESS CAPACITY CURRENTLY HAVE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WHEN THE GO AGAIN TO SEE THE E. AND OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THANK YOU TERRY MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CALLAS THE DIVISION DIRECTOR OVER THE CURRENT CALL TRANSITION DIVISION HERE ON BEHALF OF TESTIFYING ON BEHALF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMAN. PROPOSED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS PROGRAMS THE PROPOSED PROGRAM LANGUAGE FOR THE GOLD C. PATHWAYS HAS MANY SIMILARITIES TO LANGUAGE FOR THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES PROGRAMME. CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP ACADEMY PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS IS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON INTEGRATED COURSES ACROSS A SPECIFIC PATHWAY STUDENTS ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP CALORIES HAVING A THREE G. COMPLETION RATE OF APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE OF RATE OF ABOVE 95% IT IS ALSO ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE OF EIGHTY SEVEN POINT THREE PERCENT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED OPPORTUNITIES FURTHER DISCUSS THE SUSTAINABILITY PLAN FOR THE GOLDEN STATE PATHWAYS PROGRAM ALSO REGARDING THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF DORM ROOM AT PROGRAMS OUR DIVISION HAS SUPPORTED EARLY COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL AND MIDDLE COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS ALONG WITH DUAL ENROLLMENT ACROSS THE STATE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER EXPAND DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS WHICH IN OUR SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS OF THE PROPRIOCEPTIVE THANK YOU- COMMUNICATE LEGIS. AFTERNOON GOOD YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN- MEMBER PARTY MEMBER O'DONNELL- UNDER THIS ITEM I'LL FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THREE AREAS IT DUAL ENROLLMENT UNDER THE- COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS KNOWN TO SEE CAP. ADULT EDUCATION AND TO THE CALIFORNIA STEM PATHWAYS GRANT. WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT I DO ONE ROLE MANAGER C. CAP WAS ELEVATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CURRENTLY SEVENTY SIX COMMUNITY COLLEGES PARTICIPATING C. CAB. RIDING NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO. EARLY COLLEGE AND THESE PATHWAYS THAT ARE PROVEN. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SPECIALLY APPLIED THE PROPOSAL TO REMOVE THE SUNSET ON THIS PROVEN PROGRAM. THE SUNSET HAS BEEN A BARRIER TO EXPANDING PATHWAYS EXPANDING PARTNERSHIPS WITH K. TWELVE DISTRICTS. AND IN CREATING LONG TERM PLANNING TO RECRUIT. AND ENGAGE UNDER REPRESENTED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- WE ALSO URGE THAT THE CONTINUED FOCUS ON DOING ROMAN EXPANSION- BE FOCUSED ON TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND ENCOURAGE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT DUAL CREDIT. I AND THAT STUDENTS- FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS YOUR GREATER AND TARGETED. ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH. WITH REGARD TO ADULT EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL- A PROPOSAL- WE FIND THE GOALS A LAUDABLE BUT CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE A POSITION NO WAIT FOR FURTHER DETAILS AND DISCUSSION. AROUND THE CALIFORNIA STEM PATHWAYS GRANT AND THIS IS A RELATIVELY NEW PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES- AS WAS SHARED BY THE YELLOW- GRADES NINE THROUGH FOURTEEN EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS AND- TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH ALL INDUSTRIES. THAT ARE GROWING HAVE. PROVEN CREDENTIALS THAT PROVIDE LITTLE LIVING WAGES FOR STUDENTS AND ALSO ARE KNOWN FOR NEEDING ADDITIONAL DIVERSE. AND GREATER ACCESS PATHWAYS FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS THESE PARTNERSHIPS ESTABLISHED PATHWAYS BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES HIGH SCHOOLS AND INDUSTRY EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE AN INDUSTRY PARTNER THAT WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH THEM. THE GENERAL GENERALLY THE GRANTS HAVE SUPPORTED HIGH SCHOOLS THE COLLEGE ONLINE PROGRAMS WITH A DIRECT CONNECTION TO ENTRY LEVEL JOBS THAT LEADER PROVIDE A CAREER LADDER FOR STUDENTS. ARE THE PROGRAMS RECENTLY LAUNCHED AS I MENTIONED IN TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND CURRENTLY SERVE JUST OVER SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS. T AN INITIAL REPORT IS NOT DUE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUT WE WILL WE ARE COMPILING SURVEY DATA SO THAT YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF THIS PROGRAM AND- AND ITS POTENTIAL AND BENEFITS. EARLY SURVEY DATA INDICATES THAT THE PROGRAM IS MEETING THE INTENT- AND PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS TO DUAL ENROLLMENT SPECIFICALLY IN STEM TO TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WE THINK THIS IS A WORTHY EFFORT. THANK YOU AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR THE DUAL ENROLLMENT PROPOSAL. SO THAT BEFORE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YEAH I GUESS YOU NEED. YES THERE ARE BIG FANS OF DUAL ENROLLMENT I THINK IT CAN BE A GAME CHANGER FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ACCESS AND- GETTING THROUGH COLLEGE QUICKER RATE LESS DEBT YOU KNOW LOTS OF PLUSES. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS STUDENT ROLES THEY GET ETA OF COURSE AND THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES HAVE A PIECE OF IT TO. SO WHAT IS THIS PROPOSING TO DO. SO THERE THERE ARE TWO KEY COMPONENTS TO IT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THE FIRST IS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO ALLOW AN ABEL AND ELLY EIGHT TO ENTER INTO A C. CAP AGREEMENT AND THEN TO A ULTIMATELY DEVELOP BUT OF COURSE- FOR LIKE CATALOG OF AVAILABLE COURSES FOR STUDENTS- AFTER. AFTER SCHOOL FIGHT THE SECOND AND PROBABLY LARGER COMPONENT- TO THE PROPOSAL ACTUALLY TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO- ROB PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES TO STUDENTS ON THOSE CAMPUSES SO IT'S NOT JUST- YOU KNOW THE TEACHING COMPONENT BUT IT'S ALSO TO PROVIDE. SOME LEVEL OF SUPPORT SERVICES FOR TUTORING OR ACCESS T THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES AFTER THOSE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN THESE COURSES. SO CAN I ONE TIME YOU WANT ONE TIME PLANNING MONEY TO HELP. IT OUT- THE DYLAN ROMAN COMPONENT YES OF THE PROPOSAL THAT THE GRANTS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE THAT'S THE SMALLEST COMPONENT IT'S ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT FOR SCHOOL SITE- BUT BOTH THE LARGER COMPONENT WHICH IS FOCUSED ON THE STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES IS INTENDED TO BE USED OVER BY SCHOOLS OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD TOOK A PRIVATE TO PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORT SERVICES SO IT'S NOT JUST PLANNING IT SAID ADULT SERVICES ACTUAL THOUGHT AROUND HOW WE CAN HELP THOSE STUDENTS BE SUCCESSFUL THROUGH THOSE COURSES. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT'S NOT JUST ACCESS THE TOLL FOR SUCCESS IN THOSE COURSES YES SO YOU WE OFFER THE COURSES SO IS IT LIKE SUPPORT IS A FINANCIAL IS A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE GIVING TO THE STUDENTS WHO IS A KOREAN. ROCK LIKE INVESTED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IS GOING TO. NOW HIRING JOHNSON HIGH SCHOOL. THINK OF IT SAC CITY COLLEGE FOR ONE MOMENT. WHAT WILL THEY NOW HAVE BECAUSE OF THIS PROPOSAL. CERTAINLY I THINK WHAT WHAT WE ENVISIONED AT THE PREDOMINANT- MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS TO BE USED FOR WOULD BE YOU KNOW SERVICES LIKE TUTORING SERVICES LIKE SUPPLEMENTAL- INSTRUCTION IF YOU NEED HELP I IN YOUR COURSE- THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE ENVISION THE BULK OF THE MONEY TO BE USED BY SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE IT CAN ALSO PROVIDE- YOU KNOW FOR COUNSELING FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO THE- TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHAT THEIR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITIES COULD BE. AND HOW TO ENGAGE IN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW ONCE THEY'RE THERE YOU COMPLETED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL. CAREER OKAY. THANK YOU. SO IT IS THERE EVER BEEN A THOUGHT FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I KNOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO NOT INAPPROPRIATELY SPENT ONE TIME MONEY TO DO OUR BEST WE HAVE THIS INFUSION OF ONE TIME MONEY AND SO ASKED ISSUE AND SOME THAT THINGS ARE KIND OF A STRETCH AND- WE PUT THIS ONE TIME MONEY OUT THERE AND- I'M SEEING THIS LOCALLY WITH MY OWN SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE. BUT THE LOOMING STRIKE IS THAT THERE'S ONE TIME FEDERAL MONEY AND- YOU KNOW. COVERED MONEY AND IT'S HARD TO. SPEND ON PEOPLE IS THERE THE DISTRICTS ARE NERVOUS ABOUT HAVING IT THERE SO. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT LIKE BUNDLING THIS MORNING USING IT OVER YOU KNOW FIVE TO TEN YEAR PERIOD SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CERTAINTY IN ACTUALLY. OUR PEOPLE TO DO THE STUFF WE WANT TO DO BECAUSE YOU'RE RUNNING INTO THE SAME ISSUE OVER AND OVER WE HAVE THESE GRAND IDEAS. FOR ONE TIME AND WHEN THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD OUT THERE. DOESN'T QUITE WORK. YES THE CERTAINLY WORK MORE TEMPTING TO YOU KNOW WE UTILIZE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE OVER A MULTIYEAR PERIOD- YOU KNOW WHERE WE THINK WE CAN- DO THAT PRETTY SUCCESSFULLY- SO YOU KNOW WE TRY TO BUILD THAT INTO THIS PROGRAM- ESPECIALLY ON THE SUPPORT SERVICE SIDE- SO CERTAINLY WERE OPEN TO A CONVERSATION AROUND. YOU KNOW IF POTENTIALLY WORK WE'RE LOOKING AT A TIME FRAME THAT'S TOO SHORT- AND WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE UP FURTHER BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THIS TIES BACK TO THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGES THAT WE'RE SEEING THROUGHOUT INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW RIGHT WHERE. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS WILL HELP WITH CREATING COLLEGE GOING CULTURES HELP WITH TRANSITIONS FROM- YOU KNOW BETTER OR CAN COLLEGE COMPLETION IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION BECAUSE WE'LL START WITH SOME UNITS- WHEN YOU ENTER A CULTURE UNIVERSITY SO WE DO THESE PROGRAMS REALLY IS SORT OF HELPING. TO PUSH STUDENTS THROUGH THE HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM AND INTO THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND THEN ULTIMATELY WITH OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE YOU KNOW THE HIGHER EDUCATION SPACE IT'S PULLING THOSE STUDENTS INTO THAT SPHERE AND ULTIMATELY TRAINING UP FOR A LOT OF THESE AREAS WHERE WE SEE THESE RECOGNIZE PRONOUNCED. IN A WORK FORCE SHORTAGES RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU- WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND THAT WILL- CONCLUDED THIS ITEM WE ARE GOING TO NOT HERE ISSUE NUMBER THE LAST ISSUE ON THAT CAREER. A CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM WE'LL HAVE THAT AND THAT.
