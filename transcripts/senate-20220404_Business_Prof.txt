IN THE INTERIM WE WILL MOVE FORWARD AND ACT AS A SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING BILLS WE HAVE THE PRO TEM CENTER ATKINS WITH THIS APPROACH HIM YOU HAVE ONE BILL BEFORE US TODAY SENATE BILL THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THIS MORNING AS I PERCENT SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. AND TO START I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL I READ THE ANALYSIS WITH GREAT INTEREST. AND I SO APPRECIATE YOUR APPROACH AND YOUR SUGGESTIONS. SHOULD SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE ADVANCE TODAY I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE POLICY CONSIDERATION MENTIONED. SPECIFICALLY ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS RELATING TO REDUCING. ABORTION TRAINING BARRIERS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRANSITION TO PRACTICE. IF YOU ASK ME THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS MANAGING A COMMUNITY CLINIC- SERVICES AT A WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTER. IF I'D STILL BE TALKING ABOUT DEFENDING ROE VERSUS WADE AND FIGHTING FOR ABORTION ACCESS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I WOULD HAVE SAID I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT. BUT HERE WE ARE. IN STATE HOUSES IN COURTHOUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALL THEWAY TO THE SUPREME COURT ARE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ARE BEING STOLEN FROM US. ONCE AGAIN WOMEN ARE BEING PUSHED TO EXTREME MEASURES TO ACCESS ABORTION CARE. AND ONCE AGAIN THEY FACE HAVING TO PUT THEIR BODIES IN DANGER. AND THAT'S WHY WE FIND OURSELVES YET AGAIN IN A POSITION OF DEFENSE. NO I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO ON THE BASKETBALL COURT THE BEST DEFENSE IS A GOOD OFFENSE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. BY GIVING MORE TRAINED AND QUALIFIED NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE ABORTIONS WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE IS A PROACTIVE STEP TO FURTHER INCREASE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY REPRODUCTIVE CARE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR STATE IS FACING A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS. ESPECIALLY IN THE LATINO BLACK AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES A PROBLEM THAT'S EXPECTED TO GET EVEN MORE DIRE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. CURRENTLY OVER 40% OF COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T EVEN HAVE CLINICS OR PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE ABORTION. THOSE TWO FACTORS COMBINED ME THAT FAR TOO MANY PREGNANT PEOPLE WHO MAY NEED TO CONSIDER ABORTION AS AN OPTION CAN I DO SO. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD OFFER THAT OPTION TO MORE WOMEN AND FAMILIES. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A LEADER IN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. BUT THE PRACTICAL NEED TO ENSURE REAL ACCESS IS FAR FROM DONE. ONE EARLY STEP I TOOK WAS OFFERING AB ONE FIFTY FOUR IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO EXPAND THE TYPES OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO CAN PERFORM FIRST TERM ABORTIONS WITH THE SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR TO INCLUDE NURSE PRACTITIONERS. IN SEVEN YEARS LATER THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB EIGHT NINETY AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOOD AND IT CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR QUALIFYING NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE CARE FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR. AND NOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE LAWS CAN WORK TOGETHER IN UNISON. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY CAN ALSO PROVIDE FIRST TERM ABORTIONS WITHOUT A PHYSICIAN'S SUPERVISION. THE BILL ALSO CLARIFIED THAT AMONG OTHER CRITERIA NURSE PRACTITIONERS NEED THREE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE UNDER A PHYSICIAN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY. NURSE PRACTITIONERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PROVIDING REPRODUCTIVE CARE. ALLOWING EXPERIENCED PART NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO UTILIZE THEIR FULL TRAINING AND EDUCATION WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED REPRODUCTIVE CARE PRACTITIONERS. PARTICULARLY IN AREAS LACKING ACCESS TO CARE. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE BILLS OFF OF THE SUCCESS OF THESE TWO PRIOR LEGISLATION ON BILLS TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE CARE WHILE ALSO LIFTING UP A WORKFORCE OF SKILLED NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND GIVING THEM MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS. WHILE TIME SEEMS TO BE MOVING BACKWARDS I THINK IN MANY PLACES ACROSS THE NATION THIS BILL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD- TO TESTIFY MISTER CHAIRMAN. IN SUPPORT WE HAVE CHRISTY WASTE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND DEBBIE BAMBERGER A WOMEN'S HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONER AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN EAST OAKLAND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND- YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM BEFORE MOVING FORWARD WITH TESTIMONY LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM BUT INSTEAD OF DIRECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ROTH HERE ROTH HERE MELENDEZ ARCHULETA ARCHULETA HERE BEAT BACKER BACKER HERE DAUGHTER EGGMAN- TARO. JONES JONES HERE LEYVA LEYVA HERE MAN. MANY HERE NEWMAN NEWMAN HERE A SHOW ABOUT A SHOW BOTH HERE PAN. AND HERE. WE HAVE A QUORUM. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ANYONE WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO THE TWO INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED BY THE PRO TEM DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAY INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY. IN THIS CASE EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURES. DECEMBER CHRISTY WIESE PLEASE PROCEED. CHRISTY WE SOMEHOW FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PROGRAM'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND THRILLED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT AND AS THE SPONSOR. I WANT TO GIVE THE REST OF MY TIME TO ONE OF OUR NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO BE BOMBARDED WHO WILL SPEAK TO HER EXPERIENCE IN MORE DETAIL AS A NURSE PRACTITIONER WORKING I'M IN THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND ABORTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR AND DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUE TODAY. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE PROTON FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO ABORTION SERVICES. MY NAME IS DEBBIE BAMBERGER I'M A WOMEN'S HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONER AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN EAST OAKLAND AND A CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS MEMBER. I'M ALSO AN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER FOR TEACH TRAINING AND EARLY ABORTION FOR COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. I'VE BEEN A PRACTICING NURSE PRACTITIONER FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS I EARNED A MASTER OF SCIENCE IN NURSING AS WELL AS A DOCTORATE OF NURSING PRACTICE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. IN MY WORK AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD I PROVIDE FAMILY PLANNING GYNECOLOGY AND ABORTION SERVICES BOTH MEDICATION AND ASPIRATION OR SURGICAL. I WAS THE FIRST NURSE PRACTITIONER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WAS TRAINED TO DO ASPIRATION ABORTION WHEN SENATOR ATKINS PREVIOUS BILL AB ONE FIFTY FOUR WAS MADE LAW ALLOWING SUPERVISED AND PEAS PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AND NURSE MIDWIVES. TO PROVIDE ABORTION SERVICES TO OUR PATIENTS. AT MY CLINIC WE SERVE A DIVERSE URBAN POPULATION WITH PATIENTS COMING FROM ALL SURROUNDING AREAS TO RECEIVE CRITICALLY NEEDED REPRODUCTIVE CARE. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A SHORTAGE OF ABORTION PROVIDERS OVER 40% OF COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T EVEN HAVE A SINGLE CLINIC THAT PROVIDES ABORTION. AND BECAUSEOF THE ATTACKS ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IN OTHER STATES WE ARE ALREADY SEEING PATIENTS FROM TEXAS. TRAVELING HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO GET AN ABORTION PROCEDURE THAT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD INCREASE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY ABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE CARE BY CONTINUING THE INTENT OF TWO PREVIOUS BILLS. AB ONE FIFTY FOUR AND AB EIGHT NINETY BECAUSE AB EIGHT NINETY GAVE CALIFORNIA AND P. IS THE ABILITY TO PRACTICE WITHOUT A PHYSICIAN'S SUPERVISION. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD BRING THE STATUTE ALLOWING MPS TO PROVIDE FIRST TRIMESTER ABORTION IN LINE WITH ALL THE OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND PEAS CAN OFFER. THE INTENT OF SENATOR ATKINS PREVIOUS BILL AB ONE FIFTY FOUR WAS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE BY EXPANDING THE TYPES OF PROVIDERS WHO PERFORM ABORTIONS. WHILE THERE ARE MANY CALIFORNIA AND PEACE WHO ARE WILLING AND INTERESTED IN BEING TRAINED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. AND PEAS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND PROVIDERS WHO WILL TRAIN THEM AS MANY OF THE TRAINING PROCEDURES ARE GIVEN TO PHYSICIAN RESIDENTS RATHER THAN OTHER PROVIDERS. THERE IS A PARTICULAR DEARTH OF TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN AREAS LIKE FRESNO BAKERSFIELD AND MERCED. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD NOT ONLY INCREASE ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES BUT WOULD GROW THE PROVIDER POOL SINCE EXPERIENCED MPS COULD TRAIN OTHER MPS ON ABORTION PROCEDURES. THERE IS NO REASON THAT ABORTION SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER PROCEDURES AND PEAS PROVIDE. EVEN BEFORE AB EIGHT NINETY I WAS PROVIDING ABORTION CARE AND SERVING PATIENTS WHEN MY SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN WAS NOT PHYSICALLY PRESENT. OFTEN HOURS AWAY I KNOW MY LIMITATIONS I KNOW WHEN TO CONSULT OTHER PROVIDERS AND I KNOW WHEN TO CALL FOR HELP. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WILL ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ABORTION SERVICES WITHOUT THE UNNECESSARY STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES THAT LIMIT THE NUMBERS OF MPS WHO CAN PRACTICE. I RECENTLY HAD A PATIENT WHO IS IN URGENT NEED OF AN ASPIRATION PROCEDURE THIS WAS A NONVIABLE PREGNANCY THAT RESULTED IN A MISCARRIAGE THE PATIENT WAS FROM HAYWARD AND HOW TO TRAVEL TO MY CLINIC IN EAST OAKLAND IN ORDER TO GET THE CARE SHE NEEDED. IF I HADN'T BEEN AVAILABLE SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM POTENTIALLY WAITING MANY HOURS FOR CARE DURING A SCARY AND VULNERABLE TO HI. AND THIS PLACE IN URBAN AREA OF CALIFORNIA IMAGINE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN ONE OF THE COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY ABORTION PROVIDERS. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE IS ABOUT GETTING MORE PEOPLE IN FAMILIES THE CARE THEY NEED I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND THE GROWING NEED FOR MORE PROVIDERS OF ABORTION SERVICES AND ALL OTHER HEALTH CARE. SERVICES PASSING SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WILL ALLOW HIGHLY TRAINED AND QUALIFIED NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO ALLEVIATE THE HEAVY WORKLOAD THAT IS CARRIED BY ALL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AND THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO PATIENT CARE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR TESTIMONY.

THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I WANNA ABOUT THE PROGRAM FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- WE OBVIOUSLY OF GOVERN STATE AFFAIRS BUT IT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WITH OUR FEDERAL COURTS INCLUDING THE SUPREME COURT BEING INCREASINGLY OVERTAKEN BY RADICAL IDEOLOGUES WHO HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. S. N. N. OR FOUR FREEDOMS AND IT LOOKS UNLIKELY THAT ROE V. WADE I WILL MAKE IT TO THE FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY ON JANUARY TWENTY SECOND NEXT YEAR- REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS ARE UNDER ATTACK ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IN OUR COURTS. IN OUR SUPREME COURT AND SO ONCE AGAIN I THINK CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE IN A POSITION TO LEAD SO I THINK THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT I RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION BUT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE PREPARE IN THE STATE FOR WHAT WILL LIKELY BE. A FLOOD OF WOMEN SEEKING REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES IN OUR STATE AND SO- I I'M GOING TO VOTE I AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THE CO AUTHOR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN CENTER PAM.

IN TERMS OF- TRAINING AND SUPERVISION- I CERTAINLY SUPPORT VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL- REGARDING- EXPAND THE ACCESS TO- FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS PERFORM- THE ASPIRATION PROCEDURES AS AS OUTLINED- BUT ALSO BUT DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT TRIED. AS NURSE PRACTITIONERS HAVE. MOVING TOWARD IN A PRACTICE THAT WE HAVE SOME EQUIVALENCE WITH OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE INDEPENDENT PRACTICE FOR EXAMPLE TO AMOUNT OF CME EACH OF US HAVE TO TAKE IT'S NOT EQUIVALENT TO THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE REQUIRED THE LAST- AND IN TERMS IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF THE EXPERIENCE DURING CLINICAL TIME. TO BE SURE THAT CORRESPONDS IN THAT TRANSITION TO PRACTICE THAT CORRESPONDS TO WHAT THEY'LL BE DOING IN PRACTICE- THAT THERE'S NOT SCRIPT AND SEE THEIR- WHICH- SO.

THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SENTIMENT. THANK YOU MR HERE AS USUAL CENTER PANAS SPOKEN FOR MAYBE IT WAS THE WITNESS VERY.

COMMENTS OR- SEEING NO MIKE'S UP MISTER TERRY AND COLLEAGUES I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INTO THE- THE WITNESSES TODAY I APPRECIATE- THE DISCUSSION AND THE SUPPORT AND I WILL SAY MOVING FORWARD I AM COMMITTED TO FINDING WAYS TO IMPROVE ABORTION TRAINING STANDARDS- TO COME TO SOME AGREEMENT WITH- THOSE THAT HAVE FEEDBACK STAKEHOLDERS. YOU KNOW I HOPE. IN RECOGNIZING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT- CRITERIA FOR TRAINING. OF PRACTITIONERS FRANKLY AT EVERY LEVEL OF PRACTICING CLINICIANS SO I FEEL THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN BUILD UPON THIS AND HOPEFULLY COME TO SOME AGREEMENT. SO I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK IN GOOD FAITH WITH PHYSICIANS AND ANY OTHER INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS. AND TO YOUR POINT WITH AN INCREASING PROVIDER SHORTAGE WHICH HAS ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES. NOT JUST AN ABORTION CARE BUT I WOULD SAY IN PRIMARY CARE AS WELL WE WANT TO STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S POSITION AS A LEADER OUR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM.

IS IT OKAY IF I PRESENT FROM MY EARLY MAY AND I WOULD ASK THOSE ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE TO PLEASE MUTE YOUR- BONES. THERE JONES SENATE BILL NINE ONE NINE PLEASE PROCEED IN READING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATE BILL NINE ONE NINE WOULD HELP COMBAT CATHOLIC CONVERTER THEFTS WITH A THREE PRONGED APPROACH. FIRST THIS BILL REQUIRES NEW AND USED MOTOR VEHICLE DEALERS TO PERMANENTLY MARK THE VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OR THE VAN ON A CALORIE CONVERTER OF ANY VEHICLE BEFORE THEY SELL IT THIS REQUIREMENT WILL CREEK RECREATE WILL CREATE A WAY TO IDENTIFY A CALCULATOR IF IT IS ILLEGALLY REMOVED FROM THE CAR. SECOND THIS BILL ALLOWS METAL RECYCLERS TO BUY CATALYTIC CONVERTERS ONLY IF THEY HAVE A CLEARLY VISIBLE AND ON TAMPERED VAN ON THEM. RECYCLERS WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO KEEP DETAILED RECORDS OF ALL SALES FROM BOTH BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS AND MAKE THOSE RECORDS ACCESSIBLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIRD THIS BILL ADDS FINES TO THE CURRENT PENALTIES FOR CALIBER THEFTS AND MAKES IT EASIER TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST AND PROSECUTION. I WANT TO SHOW THE COMMITTEE WHERE CAROL CONVERTER LOOKS LIKE- BUT I FORGOT TO BRING IT SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT IN THE NATION FOR KELLY CONVERTER THEFTS WITH EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DEATHS JUST LAST YEAR. THAT'S A 13100% INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WEALTHY YOU CAN STILL CALIBURN UNDER TWO MINUTES AND MAKE A QUICK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. THEFT VICTIMS OF FACE UP TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE CONVERTER. AND A LOSS OF THE VEHICLE WHILE THERE'S GETS FIXED. THE PROBLEM HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SLOWING DOWN. THAT'S MAKING OUR ACTION TODAY ON THE MAJOR OF THE UP MOST IMPORTANCE. MY BILL INCORPORATES A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO TACKLE CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS FROM ALL ANGLES. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME MAY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ADDITIONAL MANDATES ON BUSINESSES AND I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. TO FIND A SOLUTION ADDRESSES THEIR CONCERNS AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM CALICUT BERNARD THEFTS. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU OF CENTER JONES I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE- TWO WITNESSES ON THE LINE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT YES SIR A DETECTIVE LEONARD WITH THE CHULA VISTA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ALISON ADDY IF I PRONOUNCE THAT LAST NAME CORRECTLY. WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU WERE ON THE LINE PLEASE PLEASE PROCEED. THIS IS DETECTIVE LEONARD. PLEASE PROCEED SIR. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SAMSON LEONARD AND I'M A DETECTIVE WITH THE TO THE BEST A POLICE DEPARTMENT. CATALYTIC CONVERTERS OR CATS ARE THE PERFECT TARGET FOR THIEVES. VALUABLE SIMPLE TO STILL IMPOSSIBLE TO TRADE. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS NO RECOURSE. POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY IS A CRIME AGAINST THE PERSON. SO WITHOUT A PERSON OR VICTIM THERE'S NO CRIME. OFFICERS LOCATE CATCH DURING TRAFFIC STOPS. KNOW THAT THEIR STONE BECAME PROVE IT. AND THE SUSPECTS ARE NEVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAD OVER TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED CAPTIVES REPORTED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT'S IN MY CITY INCREASED BY SEVEN HUNDRED PERCENT. THIS YEAR'S LOOKING WORSE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE PARK ON THE STREET OR UNSECURED LOTS- SPECIALLY VULNERABLE. I MET VICTIMS LIKE CLAUDIA AND JORGE WHO CAN AFFORD REPAIRED OR STOLEN CATCH ANOTHER MAKE PAYMENTS ON CARS THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN USE. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS CURRENT LAW CREATED A BLACK MARKET TO MINIMAL OVERSIGHT OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CASH TRANSACTIONS. IF I WOULD HAVE POLITICIANS BUSINESS THEM APPLICATION WITH THE COUNTY I COULD SELL CATS TO RECYCLER. THAT NOW NEED ONLY LOG MY BUSINESS NAME. THE RECYCLERS ARE ACTING WITHIN THE LAW AND THEY CAN CLAIM IGNORANCE BECAUSE THE STONE CAT HAS ALREADY BEEN LAUNDERED BY THE PREVIOUS TRANSACTION. BETWEEN THE FIFTH AND MY SHOW BUSINESS. I SPECTATORS WHERE. WE THOUSAND OF CASH THE UP WAITING SHE TO OUR- TO THE TRAINED- CATCH JACK CUTS STOLEN. BUT HOW DO YOU PROVE THAT SOMETHING ENTREES STONE. SENATE BILL NINE ONE NINE MAKE THE STATE BEFORE REACHING FOR SARTELL. CATS WILL NOT BE MARKED WITH. MAKING UNIQUE ALLOWING OFFICERS TO LOCATE VICTIMS MAKE ARRESTS. ACT BASED ON PROBABLE CAUSE ABSENT IN A READILY AVAILABLE VICTIM AND FINALLY. THIS BILL WILL CLOSE LOOPHOLES AND THAT REQUIREMENTS MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LAUNDER STOLEN CATS. AND THE BLACK MARKET WILL SLOW OVERNIGHT. OPPONENTS OF THE BILL OUR COMPANIES WORRIED ABOUT INCREASED OVERHEAD. BUT SUPPORTERS ARE JORGE CLAUDIA AND EVERY CALIFORNIAN IMPACTED AND FRUSTRATED BY THIS CRIME. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT A FIGHTING CHANCE AND THAT'S WHAT I SUPPORT SENATE BILL NINE ONE NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR MISSOURI PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING PONDERED THE DEVELOPMENT EIGHTY WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT SEVEN OF THE STATE'S LARGEST HOME AND AUTO INSURER.

DESPITE THE FACT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN VEHICLE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AT THE ANALYSIS WHILE POINTS OUT THAT HAD ONLY BEEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUT THIS ISSUE IS IN THE FOREGROUND ONE COMPANY NOTED THAT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL CATALYTIC CONVERTER BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH ONLY FIFTY SEVEN. BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WITH THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THIS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY ON AVERAGE THIS IS RESULTING IN TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN QUEENS. HER COMPANY ANNUALLY.

ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION IN PERSON. TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION SIR PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND PROCEED VERY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY SAMPSON WITH SAMPSON ADVISERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. THE IN CDA HAS TAKEN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB NINE NINE NINETEEN AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE. WITH US REGARDING OUR CONCERNS. FIRST YOU CAN SEE A- THE UNDERLYING INTENT TO THE BILL. INTO THIS AND CURRENTLY SUPPORTS OTHER CATALYTIC CONVERTER MEASURES. FOCUSED ON INCREASED ENFORCEMENT. AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL CNC DA'S CONCERNS RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO THE REQUIREMENT THE DEALERSHIPS PERMANENTLY MARK. OR ETCH THE VIN NUMBER INTO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BEFORE THE VEHICLE CAN BE SOLD. WE'VE BEEN INFORMED THAT SOME BELIEVE THAT PERMANENT MARKING PERMANENTLY MARKING THE VIN NUMBER IS SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE. BUT IS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT MANY VEHICLE MODELS INCORPORATE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. IS PART OF THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD REQUIRING DEALERSHIP TECHNICIANS TO DISASSEMBLE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE VEHICLE ENGINE JUST ACCESS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. TO PROVIDE JUSTTWO EXAMPLES TO PERMANENTLY MARK ONE BALL THE MODEL. IT WOULD TAKE DEALERSHIP TECHNICIANS TWO POINT EIGHT TO FOUR HOURS TO PERMANENTLY MARK ONE VEHICLE DEPENDING ON ENGINE VARIANT. FOR CERTAIN ACURA MODELS IT CAN TAKE TWO TO FIVE HOURS. BUT EVEN ASSUMING PERMANENTLY MARKING VIN NUMBERS INTO CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WAS SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE. WE WOULD KNOW FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT MANY OF THE MOST TARGETED VELAR VEHICLES ARE NOT EVEN BEING SOLD BY NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS. DATA FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF ONE LARGE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT MOST. BUT THAT THE MOST TARGETED VEHICLE ARE 200-062-0009 PREVIOUS'S WHICH VERY FEW NEW CAR DEALERS EVEN SELL. RATHER THOSE ARE OFTEN SOLD THROUGH PRIVATE VENDORS SELLERS LIKE CRAIGSLIST EBAY MOTORS IN FACEBOOK MARKET PLACE GET SB NINE NINETEEN DOES NOT SEEK TO REQUIRE PERMANENT MARKING THROUGH THOSE FORMS. WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S NO SERVICE SILVER BULLET TO THIS PROBLEM AT THE SAME TIME C. N. C. D. A WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON A MORE TARGETED SOLUTION WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS. ARE NOT SALAS SADDLED WITH THE LABOR INTENSIVE AND COSTLY OBLIGATION OF PERMANENTLY MARKING EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE THAT THEY SELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY. THE TELECONFERENCE ORVIS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE MODERATOR IF YOU'D PLEASE PROMPT ANY SUCH INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY. IN OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL NINE ONE NINE WE WILL CONTINUE. RIGHT DON'T. AND IF YOU NEEDED THE Q. ONE ZERO. AND ONE MOMENT PLEASE. ANALYZE IT HERE UP HERE ONE MOMENT.

AT DAVIS YOU'RE- TO THE AUTHOR BED DIDN'T THE- ISSUES RAISED BY THE NEW CAR DEALERS. OPS POTENTIAL- I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR SISTER YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEM AS A SAID SOMETHING I THINK THE WHERE YOU CAN MEET THEM. A KIND OF POSSIBLY. BUT AND ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. YES WHERE WERE WE HAD A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION LAST WEEK- MY STAFF IS RUDE IS IN CONTINUOUS CONVERSATION WITH THEM. WHEN WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT THERE'D BE ALMOST A DOZEN OTHER YOU KNOW CONVERTER BILLS ON THIS AS WELL SO- WE'RE WE'RE GONNA WORK VERY AGGRESSIVELY WITH THEM IN AND- THEY'RE HAVING A BOARD MEETING AT SOME POINT TIME THIS WEEK I THINK. AND HOPEFULLY GET TO A POINT WHERE. WE'RE ALL HAPPY WITH LANGUAGE ANSWER TO BE CLEARLY DID WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE FOR NEW CARS- AN OLDER MODEL CARS AS RELATES TO ACCESS TO CATALYTIC CONVERTERS YES ON SOME OF THE NEW CARS- WE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IF IT'S HARD FOR THE MECHANIC TO GET TO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. I THINK THE SAME ASSUMPTIONS IS HARD FOR THE CONVERTER WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AT THIS POINT TIME IS HOW DO WE PRETEND TO LANGUAGE. AS TO. THE CONVERTERS ARE DIFFICULT TO GET TO VERSUS THE ONES THAT ARE EASIER TO GET TO. PROJECTED BASED ON THAT OF THE GLASS WITH BUILDING THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR NORMAN CENTER PAM ACTUALLY SERVE ALONG THE SAME LINES A CENTER- NEWMAN- AND DOES MAKE I THINK THAT THAT ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THERE'S LIKE TEN BILLS ON CALCULATORS- SO AND CERTAINLY NO THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM AND- MY DISTRICT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD- I GUESS INTRACELLULARLY WITH THE NEW CAR DEALERS- AND- IT IS. VISITORS DATA AS ANYONE BEEN ABLE TO GET DATA IN TERMS OF THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE NEWER AND THE NEWER MODELS WHEN THEY'RE IN THE MANIFOLDS ORDERS ACTUALLY BEING STOLEN AT THAT BECAUSE- THEY'RE HARDER TO GET TO SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE. INFORMATION OR ANY OF THE WITNESSES THAT HAVE HAS INFORMATION. REGARDS TO THE- DEGREE OF RISK OF THOSE CAL CONVERTS COMPARED TO ONES IN OLDER MODELS WHERE THEY'RE MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE AND UNDERSIDE CAR. MY UNDERSTANDING WITH MY CONVERSATION WITH THE NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION LAST WEEK IS SOME VEHICLES ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET TO. AND SOME NEW VIEW NEWER VEHICLES. ARE NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET TO SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS. WHAT MATRIX- DO WE USED TO JUST DISCERN THAT AND LAW. AND WHAT LANGUAGE CAN WE COME UP WITH TO MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE. AND SO I TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THERE BEING NUMEROUS BILLS. ON THIS ISSUE- I WOULD IMAGINE AT SOME POINT TIME. YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE BILLS ARE GONNA BE NARROWED DOWN. AND YOU KNOW FOR ME PERSONALLY I'M SUPPORTING ALL OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BILLS TODAY. BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING IN AND HAVE A ROBUST DIALOGUE AMONGST BOTH HOUSES. AND IN AND GET TO A SOLUTION I THINK WE WILL- BETWEEN THE SEVERAL AUTHORS AND THE STAKEHOLDERS I THINK WE'LL GET THERE. IF WE- KEEP EVERYTHING MOVING AT THIS POINT TIME. OKAY OKAY WELL I THINK I THINK RESOLUTION THAT PARTICULAR ISSUES GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AT LEAST FOR ME AND PERHAPS FOR SOME MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL- I DON'T WANT TO SEE DEALERS HAVING TO ESSENTIALLY TAKE APART. NEW CARS IN ORDER TO GET RID OF IN NUMBER AND THEN PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND POTENTIALITY. WHETHER IT'S A NEW CAR OR EVEN A FAIRLY RECENT CARD IT'S NOW DOWN AND A LOT- AND- IT'S NOT EXPENSE BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY- YOU KNOW. WELL BANDAGING CAR SOME OTHER HELP. SO ESPECIALLY IF THE RISK IS MUCH LOWER FOR SOMEONE TO STEAL THIS CALICOBURGERS BECAUSE OF THE POSITION ITSELF- SO APPRECIATE AN ANSWER AND- CERTAINLY. ABOUT FOUR TO MOVING THE BILL FORWARD BUT HOPE THAT THAT'S- EXPECTED THAT TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE IT. SHOWS UP ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU. SIR PAN AGREE WITH YOU ALMOST VERBATIM.

DIFFICULT OR- YOU KNOW A LOT OF LEG WORK TO FIND OUT. YOU KNOW WHICH CAN WHICH BOARD- LICENSE YOU CAN APPLY FOR. AND EVENTUALLY GET APPROVED. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION BEING READILY AVAILABLE SO OUR OUR GOAL HERE IS TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION MORE READILY AVAILABLE. SO THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO RE ENTER THE WORKFORCE.

CENTER MEN WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR NOVEL IF HE'S ON THE LINE TURNOVER PLEASE PROCEED. YES SIR CAN YOU HEAR ME TRONG PERFECT. I AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED- BUT ANYWAY GOOD MORNING UPDATE YOUR ROUGHLY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS PEDRO NAVA CHAIR LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIFTY SIXTY FIVE. AS YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE GOVERNMENT NOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE COMMISSION ISSUED A REPORT EXAMINING CALIFORNIA'S OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING SYSTEM. AND DURING OUR STUDY WE FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA'S WITH CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS ON THEIR RECORDS THANKS SEVERAL CHALLENGES WHEN TRYNG TO BECOME LICENSE IN A REPORT ENTITLED JOB FOR CALIFORNIANS STRATEGIES TO EASE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING BARRIERS WE OFFER SEVERAL STEPS TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. FIRST IF THEY COULD ONLY ASK FOR OFFICIAL CONVICTION RECORDS RATHER THAN RELYING ON AN APPLICANT'S MEMORY THIS WILL ENSURE THAT APPLICANTS WON'T FACE DISQUALIFICATION BECAUSE THE CONVICTIONS THEY PUT ON THEIR APPLICATIONS DON'T MATCH WHAT. COMES BACK ON A BACKGROUND CHECK. SECOND LIFE IN A DOOR SHOULD BE RE. TO LIFT ON THEIR WAY. THE CRIED TO THAT IS USED TO EVALUATE APPLICANTS WITH CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. WE WANTED TO DO THIS UP FRONT SO THAT FORMER OFFENDERS DECIDE WHETHER TO INVEST IN THE EDUCATION THE TRAINING AND THE APPLICATION PROCESS. AND FINALLY THE STATE COULD CREATE AN INFORMAL APPEALS PROCESS TO PROVIDE APPLICANTS THE OPPORTUNITY. EXPLAINED PROBLEMS WITH THEIR APPLICATIONS RIGHT NOW APPLICANTS WHO ARE DENIED A LICENSE MAY ENGAGE IN AN APPEALS PROCESS BUT THAT CAN BE CONFUSING AND EXPENSIVE. SB THIRTEEN SIXTY FIVE WOULD ADVANCE THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS. BY HELPING MITIGATE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CALIFORNIA'S WITH CONVICTIONS ON THEIR RECORDS FACE WHEN TRYING TO BECOME LIFE. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR JONES FOR THIS LEGISLATION ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY ON BEHALF COOPER COMMISSION. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME BACK IN LINE. THANK YOU JOURNAL FOR YOUR- CENTER MEN. THANK YOU TO ROTH- I WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO- YOU KNOW I THINK WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT- YOU KNOW FIRST WHY I SHOULD SAY I APPLAUD THE GOALS OF THIS PARTICULAR. BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY WE PROVIDE PATHWAYS- FOR THOSE WHO WERE REHABILITATED WHO. SERVE THEIR TIME- BUT I ALSO WORRY ABOUT. THE BURDENS THAT WERE IMPOSING ON BUSINESSES ACROSS THE BOAR HERE IN THE STATE- IT DOES STRIKE ME I CERTAINLY RESPECT. THE FACT THAT LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION A BODY ON WHICH I SAID IS SUPPORTING THIS BILL- THE FACT THAT I CHAIR NOVELS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUT BUT I DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW REDUNDANT THIS BILL IS WHAT THE COST OF THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE BOTH THE STATE. I ENTERED THE BUSINESSES AND THE PROFESSIONALS THAT IT WILL IMPACT. AND I KNOW THAT THIS BILL AT THIS POINT DOES NOT HAVE A FISCAL IMPACT- IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS UNDER STUDY- SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO CHERNOV A INTO THE AUTHOR IS. I DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL COST MIGHT BE- AND DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF AGAIN MAY MAYBE THIS IS ALREADY BEEN. ANSWERED TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE BUT- YOU KNOW IS THERE A WAY TO REDUCE THE REDUNDANCY OF THIS BILL SO THERE'S NOT CREATING OVERLAPPING REGULATIONS OF THE KIND THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE. IN MY DISTRICT- COMPLAIN ABOUT. DOES THE RANGE THE CHECKOUT PERSON YES ALL OF OUR LIVES. THE REDUNDANCY I'M I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION ON THE REDUNDANCY YOU KNOW IT THE- YOU KNOW A SPORTING COMMISSION- IS INDEPENDENT TO SOME DEGREE IN IS GOING TO HAVE TO. YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PUT THIS INFORMATION ON. THEIR WEBSITE BUT I THINK THAT'S NECESSARY AS PART OF THE BILL- ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OF THE BILL AS FAR AS THE COST- I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE THAT WORKED OUT IN APPROPRIATIONS. I SAID ON THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SO I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT COSTS TO THE DIFFERENT BOARDS AND GROWS ON THIS AS WELL SO WILL BE TAKEN IN OVER THE PHONE THAT TO THE PROCESS AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO. US CENTER MAN ONCE THAT FISCAL ANALYSIS IS DONE. THANK YOU AND THEN JUST A FOLLOW UP I'D SAY I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY JUST GIVEN THE LEVEL OF LIVER COMMISSION SUPPORT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND A GOOD SIGNAL- BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS THIS BILL MOVES ALONG TO. IDENTIFY THE COSTS AND THE BENEFITS RIGHT HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF- YOU KNOW WHETHER THIS BILLS GETTING A BANG FOR THE BUCK WELL I'M HOPEFULLY THE BENEFIT IS THAT MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA. THAT HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME AND THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY WILL BE ABLE TO COME BACK INTO SOCIETY AND BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS AND WORK ALONGSIDE WITH ALL OF US. TO MAKE A BETTER CALIFORNIA.

RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF CROPLAND LEFT DRY AND ON PLANET IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA ALONE RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT. AS OF NOW THERE'S NO STATEWIDE ENERGY THAT IS MEASURING THE EFFECTS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAVING ON THE STATE'S ECONOMIC OUTPUT. TO INFORM POLICY MAKING AROUND OUR EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THSE CLIMATE EVENTS ARE AFFECTING THE STATE'S ECONOMIC OUTPUT. WE SHOULD TAKE KEY DATA POINTS BASED ON THE CONTINUED INCREASES IN WILDFIRES ACROSS THE STATE. THE REDUCTION OF SNOWPACK IN THE SIERRA AND MORE AND MAP THEM INTO AN ECONOMIC FORECASTS THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. I AM HAVING CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH APPROPRIATE STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY CLIMATE SECTORS WE WANT EXAMINED EXPECTED COST ESTIMATES SUGGESTED FUNDING MECHANISMS AND WHETHER GOMEZ IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO DO THE WORK.

WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE HARDER TO GO THROUGH- DIRECTLY AND IN THE IDEAL WORLD. WE WOULD HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE THE ANDERSON SCHOOL INCORPORATED INTO THE AIR I THANK THEY HAVE TO HAVE A RESOLUTION FROM THE BOARD OF REGENTS AND DO ALL THIS STUFF IN SO I THINK WE WOULD PURSUE THINGS LIKE THAT AND SEE IF THAT WORKS AND IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE. GOBIZ COULD SUBCONTRACT WITH THEM AND GET AROUND ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT MIGHT SLOW IT DOWN AND DECIDED THAT THEY COULD DO IT SO FOR US IT'S JUST AS YOU SAID WE WANT TO DO THIS ORDER SEARCHING FOR MECHANISM THAT WORKS IN THE BEST WAY.

BY ELIMINATING REDUNDANT REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL AFTER A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COMPLETE SEQUEL BUT WHILE THE LEGAL MARKET CONTINUES TO EXPAND ILLEGAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY REMAINS PERSISTENT AND THIS BILL AIMS TO ENSURE TAT THOSE ENTERING INTO THE REGULATED MARKET. BY SHORTENING THE TIME IT TAKES TO AND TAINT AND ANNUAL LICENSE ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. THE EXISTING PROCESS IS THIS ONE APPLE CAN SUPPLY FOR STATE CANNABIS LICENSE THEY TYPICALLY WORK WITH THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTION FIRST TO ATTEND LOCAL APPROVAL. THE APPROVAL PROCESS INVOLVES COMPLYING WITH SEQUEL WHETHER IT RESULTS IN APPLYING FOR AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION OR PREPARING A ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW SUCH AS A NEGATIVE DECLARATION OR AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. WHEN THAT LOCAL PROCESS IS COMPLETED AND THE APPLICANT APPLIES FOR STATE COMMERCIAL CANNABIS LICENSE THE STATE MUST COMPLY WITH SEQUEL EVEN THOUGH FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE STATE SEEK WILL REVIEW THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT IS THE SAME THAT WAS ANALYZED UNDER SEEK WHAT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE DEPARTMENT CAN RELY ON A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COMPLETED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW BUT MUST UTILIZE ITS OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT A PROCESS WHICH CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TIME AND RESOURCES ASSOCIATED. WITH FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW ON THE SAME SCOPE OF THE PROJECT THAT WAS REVIEWED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- THE STATE DESIRES TO BRING EVERYBODY INTO LEGAL COMPLIANCE THERE'S DEADLINES.

COMPLIANCE pWE SEE AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW IS IMPORTANT. AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE SEE WHEN IT COMES TO MARIJUANA THE CULTIVATION THE GROWTH THE DISTRIBUTION THE SALE. OF MARIJUANA IN THE STATE IS THAT THOSE WHO PLAY BY THE RULES THOSE WHO APPLY FOR LICENSES TO PAY THE FEES AND TAXES I HAVE TO RUN THROUGH HURDLE AFTER HURDLE- AND IT IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING- AS MY COLLEAGUES IMPORTANT ALLUDED TO IT IT JUST IT NOT. A COMPETITIVE OR- YOU KNOW SALVAGEABLE POSITION FOR THESE FOLKS TO BE AND- WHEN THEY'RE COMPETING AGAINST AN UNLICENSED MARKET THAT IS REALLY.

SORRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I CALL YESTERDAY I'M PRESENTING- SENATE BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX. BY WHICH WILL PROVIDE A CALIFORNIANS WITH ACCESS TO SAFE AND TESTED MEDICINAL CANNABIS- BY ENSURING THAT OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE CITIES IN OUR COUNTIES- ALLOW- FOR THE SALE OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS. WHETHER THROUGH RETAIL OR DELIVERY OR BOTH- TO BE CLEAR I WANNA MAKE SURE A FEW THINGS ABOUT THIS BILL. THE PURPOSE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AS WE SPEAK NOW. CATEGORICALLY BANNING ANY AND ALL SALE OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS. AND STRESSED MEDICINAL CANNABIS THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE ADULT USE CANNABIS AND THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR- THIS BILL IS DIRECTLY RELATED. TO MEDICAL CANNABIS WHICH THE VOTERS LEGALIZED IN CALIFORNIA IN. NINETEEN NINETY SIX- LEGALIZING MEDICINAL CANNABIS- AM TWENTY SIX YEARS LATER- A HUGE SWATH OF CALIFORNIA CITIES CONTINUE- TO UNDERMINE- WHAT PROP TWO THIRTEEN DEAD. BY CATEGORICALLY BANNING THE SALE OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS CANNABIS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION. MEDICAL CANNABIS AS THE VOTERS ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE SCIENCE RECOGNIZES- IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH VARIOUS CONDITIONS ON MEDICAL CANNABIS- REALLY TOOK HOLD IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES- WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING FROM AIDS USED MEDICAL CANNABIS- TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH- AND TO EXPERIENCE LESS PAIN AND SUFFERING AS THEY STRUGGLED THROUGH- HIV. ARE WE ARE THE PEOPLE LIVING WITH CANCER BENEFIT CANNABIS PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING BAD SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY ON PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH ARTHRITIS WITH INSOMNIA WITH A NUMBER OF HEALTH CONDITIONS OR MEDICAL HANNAH CANNABIS HELPS PEOPLE BE HEALTHIER AND LEAD BETTER LIVES WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY THE VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY CALIFORNIA. LEGALIZED IT AND IN FACT SINCE CALIFORNIA LEGALIZED MEDICAL CANNABIS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE. STATES HAVE FOLLOWED SUIT AND YET IN CALIFORNIA TRAGICALLY- ACTIONS BY A LARGE MAJORITY OF CITIES- HAVE MADE IT. DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO PURCHASE LEGAL MEDICAL CANNABIS LEGAL MEDICINE. 62% OF CITIES 62% MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED CITIES IN CALIFORNIA CATEGORICALLY BAND. ANY SALE A CANNABIS LARGEST ADULT USE MEDICAL CANNABIS AS WELL HUGE SWATHS OF THE STATE. LITERALLY PROHIBIT AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF YOU ARE SOMEONE LET'S SAY WHO'S- UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY OR LIVING WITH HIV OR HAS SEVERE ARTHRITIS OR ANOTHER HEALTH CONDITION WHERE YOU WILL BENEFIT. AND YOU ARE BENEFITING FROM THIS ON CANNABIS YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES. EITHER TO HAVE TO TRAVEL SOMETIMES VERY LONG DISTANCES TO OBTAIN LEGAL MEDICAL CANNABIS OR MORE LIKELY YOU'LL SIMPLY BY IT ON THE ILLICIT MARKET AND I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS MADE THE PREVIOUS BILLS. THAT THIS CRIMINAL EFFECTIVE CRIMINALIZATION. BANNING. SUSAN THE LEGAL SALE AFFECTIVELY FUELS ILLICIT MARKET AND FORCES PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH CONDITIONS THE BY WHEN YOU LISTEN MARKET WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME ASSURANCE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR THE SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT THAT THEY ARE PURCHASING NOW THE REASON WHY CITIES ARE CURRENTLY AT LEAST ARGUABLY ALLOWED TO BAN THE SALE MEDICAL CANNABIS THERE'S CURRENTLY A LEGAL DISPUTE ABOUT DELIVERY BUT THE COURTS TO ADDRESS THAT THE REASON IS. THAT AFTER PROP SIXTY FOUR PASSED WHICH- AUTHORIZES CITIES THE LOCAL CONTROL TO ALLOW CITIES TO BAN THE SALE OF ADULT USE WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES AND WE'RE NOT TOUCHING ON NORTH PROBABLY COULD WAIT. THE LEGISLATURE THE NEXT YEAR AND PASSING IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION FOR PER PROP SIXTY FOUR- WITHOUT BEING REQUIRED TO DO SO THROUGH IN MEDICAL CANNABIS AND AUTHORIZED CITIES. TO BAN THE SALE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION- THAT WAS A MISTAKE I AM AND THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP WALK OUT BACK. ON WHAT SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX DIES THERE'S A SAYS THE CITY'S YOU YOU CAN DECIDE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GRAD ALLOW LEGAL MEDICAL CANNABIS CELLS IN YOUR BOUNDARIES. YOU CAN AUTHORIZE DELIVERY YOU CAN AUTHORIZE STOREFRONTS CAN AUTHORIZE BOTH- YOU WILL HAVE BROAD LATITUDE IN DECIDING- LIMITATIONS AS LONG AS IT'S REASONABLE AND ARE NOT EFFECTIVELY BANNING IT IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS AND SO FORTH- AND- THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO. IS JUST CAMPAÑA EVERYTHING I'M SO COLLEAGUES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ACCESS- BILL I APPRECIATE ALL THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR I. BOATS- WITH ME HERE TODAY- TO TESTIFY ON HIS AB JENKINS WERE BELIEVERS HERE IN PERSON FROM THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. AND THEN APPEARING BY TELEPHONE IS DEL GARINGER FROM CALIFORNIA. A NORMAL. THANK YOU SO AS JENKINS PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THE PROUD SPONSOR OF SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX THE MEDICINAL CANNABIS PATIENTS RIGHT ACCESS ACT. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION WHICH WILL RESTORE MUCH NEEDED ACCESS TO LEGAL MEDICINAL CANNABIS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE TO LEGALIZE MEDICAL CANNABIS WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP TO FIX TWO TO SEVENTEEN THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR A DECADE LATER HAS LED TO FEWER LEGALLY PERMISSIVE. PERMISSIBLE CANNABIS RETAILERS IN THE STATE THAN THERE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN OTHER WORDS MEDICINAL CANNABIS IS HARDER TO FIND THAN IT WAS A DECADE AGO WHILE ESTIMATES VARY IT IS BELIEVED THAT MORE THAN 65% OF CALIFORNIANS TWO THOUSAND PLUS. MEDICINAL DISPENSARIES SHUT THEIR DOORS BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN DEPRIVING MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENTS ACCESS TO SAFE QUALITY TESTED PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO REPORT PUBLISHED BY POLITICO THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY TWO LEGAL DISPENSARIES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ONE OF THE LOWEST RATES IN THE NATION. AMONG STATE SUPPORTING LEGAL CANNABIS SALES THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM CAN BE FOUND IN PROP SIXTY FOUR IS DUAL LICENSING STRUCTURE WHEREBY CANNABIS BUSINESSES MUST BE LICENSED BY BOTH THE STATE AND APPROPRIATE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO OPERATE. ACCORDING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE OUT OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY JURISDICTIONS VOTED IN FAVOR OF LEGALIZATION GET TO DATE TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA CITIES STILL PROHIBIT COMMERCIAL CANNABIS RETAIL. PROP SIXTY FOUR INDIFFERENTLY TRIGGERED THE CLOSURE OF THOUSANDS OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS DISPENSARIES AND THE CREATION OF NEW DRY ZONES ACROSS THE STATE. UNLICENSED CANNABIS BUSINESSES HAPPENED A MONOPOLY ON CANNABIS COMMERCE AND THIS IS NOT A THREE THEORETICAL ISSUE BUT A HUMAN ONE. CANCER PATIENTS LOOKING FOR RELIEF FROM PAINFUL SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTS VETERANS LOOKING FOR NON PHARMACEUTICAL ALTERNATIVES FOR PTSD RELATED SLEEP ISSUES AND STRESS AND CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS. LOOKING FOR SAFE LONG TERM ALTERNATIVES TO OPIATES OPIOIDS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM CALIFORNIA WROTE THE COMPASSIONATE CARE ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX. AND THE PEOPLE TO WHOM WE OWE A DUTY OF LOYALTY TODAY. SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX DOES NOT SEEK TO OVERTURN LOCAL CONTROL OR PREVENT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FROM JUST SAYING NO TO ADULT USE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. IT SIMPLY PREVENTS JURISDICTIONS FROM BARRING PATIENTS FROM ACCESSING THE MEDICINE THEY NEED FOR THESE REASONS C. C. I. A. IS PROUD TO SPONSOR SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX.

PERFECT LET'S BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE SENATE CHAMBER COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS STARTING FIRST WITH SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU TERRA- I DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL AND I'VE ADDRESS THOSE WITH THE AUTHOR- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE- IN CHARGE OF FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS IN THE STATE AND- I THINK THERE IS A PLACE FOR LOCAL CONTROL A STRONG PLACE FOR LOCAL CONTROL. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR THE ONES THAT WOULD OVERRIDE LOCAL ZONING AROUND RETAIL STOREFRONTS- THAT BEING SAID I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR IS WORKING RIGHT NOW- IN IN TRYING TO NEGOTIATE- ASPECTS OF THIS BILL WITH OPPOSITION WITH THE LEAGUE OF. CITIES AND- I DO WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR MORE TIME TO TRY TO MAKE THIS BILL IN A PLACE THAT THAT I COULD BEFORE I WEAR THIS BILL TO COME TO VOTE RIGHT NOW ON THE FLOOR I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR I WOULD NOT VOTE FOR IT- BUT I WILL VOTE FOR TODAY- JUST BECAUSE I DO WANT TO GIVE THE OTHER TIME TO. TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I HOPE HE DOES THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SETTLEMENT CENTER PANEL. THANK YOU AND- YEAH I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- DRESSING AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THIS BILL NOT THAT I'M PERSONALY A BIT OF A SKEPTICAL ABOUT MEDICAL MARIJUANA- BUT- I'D THE VOTERS SPOKE CLEARLY ABOUT ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA AND THEN THEY SPOKE AGAIN ABOUT ACCESS TO MARIJUANA. AND AND CERTAINLY THERE IS. YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE FOR. THE USE OF MARIJUANA TO HELP WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS- SO I GUESS THAT THE QUESTION OF WHAT OPPOSED TO THE OP THERE IS THAT AND WHAT LANE FOR SAY THAT- WEALTHY OPPONENTS HAVE. TESTIFIED THAT. BUT LARGE PERCENTAGE OF CALIFORNIANS- HAVE ACCESSTO MARIJUANA MEDICAL MARIJUANA CHALLENGES IS THAT WHAT THE- PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SAID IS THAT ACTUALLY. ALL CALIFORNIANS SO YOU SHOULDN'T DEPEND ON WHERE YOU LIVE WELL YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA OR NOT AND SO I BELIEVE WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND PERHAPS OFFER COMPLETE BY IS THAT IS LIKELY DOESN'T REQUIRE A LOCALITY TO HAVE A- STOREFRONT. JUST THAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE A STOREFRONT THAT THEY HAVE TO ALLOW DELIVERY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET GET GET ACCESS AS- PEOPLE CALIFORNIA SAID PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA. AND PERHAPS MAYBE CAN ALSO TOUCH ON WHETHER. LOCALITIES WOULD BE ABLE TO PERHAPS. HAVE SOME GUIDELINES ON THE DELIVERY BUT THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS DELIVERY INTERNET ALLOW STOREFRONT AND THEN SECOND OF ALL IN THE NOW IS DISAPPOINTED OUT THAT THERE IS A- YOU KNOW ISSUE ABOUT WHAT IS- UNREASONABLE AND- MAYBE. JUST CLARIFY- ACTUALLY EXACTLY HOW MUCH- SAY DOES A LOCALITY HAVE UNDER THAT STANDARD TO ACTUALLY- RESTRICT- IS A STOREFRONT- SO. AGAIN APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER POUND. WHY I'M AND I AGREE WITH YOU THE VOTERS KALISTA THAT THEY WANTED. PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS I DO JUST WANT TO KNOW- IN TERMS OF THE TESTIMONY FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS. AND THEIR LETTER I JUST HAVE TO BE HONEST AND I WORK WITH THESE GROUPS ALL THE TIME A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THEM- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LETTER. IN THE LEAST SEE SOCCER ROLE COUNTY SO WE RECEIVED- ON IT IN OUR IN OUR FUTURE- STILL COLLEGE STATISTICS. TEXTBOOK IN THE CHAPTER ABOUT HOW TO MANIPULATE STATISTICS THAT LETTER SHOULD BE AN EXHIBIT IN THAT IN THAT TEXTBOOK I DON'T SAY THAT. LIGHTLY ON THAT LETTER AND I HOPE THAT THEY WILL STOP DOING THIS IS AN EXTREME MANIPULATION- THE DATA AND IT REALLY PAINTS A VERY MISLEADING. PICTURE YOU KNOW TO TALK ABOUT COUNTIES WHEN COUNTIES ONLY REGULATE UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DISPUTES ON THAT ON THAT DATA WHEN 62% OF CITIES IN CALIFORNIA CATEGORICALLY BANUS. IN TERMS OF WHAT CITIES CAN DO- AND WE THE CITIES WILL HAVE WIDE LATITUDE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW UNDER THIS BILL AGAIN BEING. CLEAR THERE IS AN ONGOING. STAY AT THIS ABOUT WHETHER CITIES ARE ALL TO RISK DELIVERY AT ALL. THERE'S THAT'S BEING LITIGATED RIGHT NOW UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR AND THE COURTS AND THE END RESULT IS NOT. ANYWAY TOUCH OUR WE'RE NOT CHANGING- ANY EXISTING RIGHTS AND ONE HOUSE. ON THE DAY TEN- JUST YOU ONLY DELIVERY. THEIR WINE. AND THEN AND THEN THEY CAN ALSO WITH DELIVERY STOREFRONT. THEY CAN PUT AS YOU KNOW TO REASONABLE- LIMITATIONS ON AS LONG AS- THAT THOSE LIMIT THOSE LIMITATIONS. MARIN SO SEVERE THAT IT EFFECTIVELY- YOU KNOW- MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OVERLY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS. AND SO IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER IF THEY GO WITH STOREFRONT THE NUMBER OF STOREFRONTS THEY WILL HAVE. SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY THERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO ALLOW AS MANY AS PEOPLE WANT TO BUILD. THEY CAN HAVE AND REASONABLE LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF WHERE- IN TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER- SO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE. A SMALL TOWN. AND IF THEY GO WITH STORE FRONT ONE DISPENSARY MAY BE HIGHLY REASONABLE. IF THE IF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH IS AN ISSUE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALLOW CAMERAS. CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND ONE DISPENSARY. THAT'S PROBABLY ON REASONABLE FOR CITY OF ALMOST THREE MILLION. PEOPLE DAVID CAN YOU KNOW. THEY DON'T HAVE STOREFRONTS FOR EXAMPLE THEY DON'T HAVE TO LET IT BE OPEN TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. THEY CAN PUT REASONABLE HOURS LIMITATIONS- BUT NINE YEAR THEY CAN'T BUT IF THEY SAID YOU CAN BE OPEN ONE HOUR A WEEK. THAT WOULD CLEARLY BE. UNREASONABLE ON IF SOMEONE CHALLENGES THE CITY'S DETERMINATION OF WHAT'S REASONABLE. THE CITY WILL BE THAT THE WHAT WE CALL. AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION STANDARD WOULD BE APPLIED. WHICH MEANS THAT AS LONG AS THERE'S SOME REASONABLE BASIS FOR WHAT THE CITY DECIDED. THE CITY WILL HAVE BROAD LATITUDE- SO CITIES WILL STILL HI SIGNIFICANT PART. THEY SIMPLY CAN'T DO ACCOUNTABLE BAN ANYMORE HELPFUL- SO. I THINK. YOU'VE UNDERSCORED THAT CITY IS THAT LOCALITIES CITIES AND COUNTIES WILL HAVE A STILL CONTINUE TO HAVE- SERVE LATITUDE THANK THEY COULD ACTUALLY OF- ELIMINATE STORMS SAY WE WANT A STOREFRONT AND AGAIN THIS IS A JUST ABOUT MEDICAL CANNABIS THIS IS NOT CAMPUS OVERALL THE MEDICAL CANNABIS THAT THEY WOULD STILL BUT THEN THEY WOULD STILL NEED TO ALLOW PEOPLE LIVE IN THEIR TO HAVE ACCESS TO IT THROUGH THE LIVERY. SO SO WITH THAT ANY APPRECIATE CLARIFICATIONS I THINK THAT THE VOTERS DID SAY THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS AND I THINK THAT- AND SO THE NINE THEM DANCE- BY BASICALLY ELIMINATE ALL OPPORTUNITIES I THINK THIS IS PROBLEMATIC AND SO BUT I DO HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LOCALITIES TO FIGURE OUT SOMEBODY'S BOUNDARIES BUT WITH THAT- CERTAINLY- I APPRECIATE THE RAIN BILL FORD AND LOCAL SUPPORT THE BILL SO YOU CAN WORK ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR PAN- SENATOR NEW. JUST A LINE MIGHT SELF WORTH TO PANIC. AND THE BILL WHEN. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU.

BOB HUNT CUSTOMERS FROM IDENTITY THEFT AND ALSO PROTECT THE SAME CUSTOMERS FROM POTENTIAL PROFILING BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THIRD PARTY VENDORS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO IDENTIFYING CUSTOMER INFORMATION. FARM BROKERS IN CALIFORNIA HEAVILY REGULATED AND PROVIDE A VALUABLE SOURCE OF SHORT TERM CREDIT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE CREDIT SAVINGS FOR MONEY TO PAY AN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE SUCH AS CAR REPAIR ARMOR MEDICAL EMERGENCY. PROMPT BURKE POT BROKERS ALSO SERVE AS A FINANCIAL SAFETY NET FOR THE UNBANKED POPULATION AS EVERYONE WHO SEEKS A PAWN LOAN CAN BORROW MONEY REGARDLESS OF THEIR CREDIT. WORTHINESS FOR EVERY PAWN LOAN EIGHT ZERO NUMBER OF THE ITEM USE ASK COLLATERAL AS WELL AS DETAILED PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE CUSTOMER IS ENTERED INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CALIFORNIA UPON. AND SECONDHAND DEALERS SYSTEM BETTER KNOWN AS CAPS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY HIGH PROFILE DATA BREACHES IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ACCORDINGLY THE POTENTIAL FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION UPON CUSTOMERS TO BE LEAKED CREATES A HEIGHTENED RISK. OF IDENTITY THEFT BECAUSE THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES THEY ARE OFTEN LEFT WITH LITTLE OR NO RECOURSE IN THE EVENT OF THAT THEIR PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED. REDUCING THE RISK OF EXPOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION DURING SECONDHAND PAWN TRANSACTIONS IS CRITICAL TO PROTECTING VALUABLE COMMUNITIES FROM THEFT IN PREDATORY SCHEMES UNDER THIS BILL. PAWN BROKERS WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT AND RECORD THE SERIAL NUMBERS OF ALL ITEMS USED AS COLLATERAL AS WELL AS PERSONAL INFORMATION OF THE CUSTOMER. HOWEVER ONLY SERIAL NUMBERS WOULD BE ENTERED INTO THE CAPS SYSTEM THEREBY PROTECTING THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS. PAWNBROKERS WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE PERSONAL IDENTIFYING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WHEN REQUESTED ADDITIONALLY I'M AMENDING THIS BILL FOLLOWING THE COMMITTEES- WE ARE FOLLOWING THIS COMMITTEE TO CLARIFY THIS INFORMATION MUST BE PROVIDED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IMMEDIATELY UPON REQUEST AND NO LATER THAN THE NEXT BUSINESS DAY. I WANT TO THANK TWO COMEDIANS CHEER FOR THE ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDING THIS AMENDMENT. TESTIFYING TODAY AS FORMER MEMBER OF BURKE TOOK TO RICO WHO REPRESENTS THE CALIFORNIA PAWNBROKERS ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MR THREE CO PLEASE PROCEED. THANKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANKS HER BRADFORD APPROACH WORK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SOLICITATION BUMMER BECAUSE OF A CONCERN FOR YEARS ABOUT PROTECTING THE PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION FOR THE CUSTOMERS MANY OF WHOM ARE OUR IMPACT AS MUCH OF MY CENTER BRADFORD AND RUFFLE UP WITH LITTLE OR NO RECOURSE IN THE EVENT OF PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS COMPROMISED MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE CAPS FOR THE CUP REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WHAT A DEFECT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE NEITHER LEGISLATORS NOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ENVISIONED THAT JUST TWO WEEKS AGO PRESIDENT BOTTOM WOULD ACTUAL FORMAL WARNING TO AMERICAN BUSINESS LEADERS TELLING THEM TO STRENGTHEN THEIR COMPANY'S CYBER SECURITY'S IMMEDIATELY. THE PRESENCE CONCERNED ARE SHARED BY A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF US SENATORS HOOSIER LETTER LAST MONTH TO HOMELAND SECURITY RAISING QUESTION ABOUT AMERICA'S READINESS. FOR RUSSIAN CYBER AND DISINFORMATION THREATS. IN TWENTY TWENTY- GOVERNMENT ONE THE WORST. CYBERESPIONAGE INSTANCE RECORDED THAT WERE ACT US FIRMS INCLUDING MICROSOFT. WHILE IT WAS INITIALLY BELIEVED THAT THE ATTACK WAS LIMIT US TREASURY DEPARTMENT. OFFICIALS LATER LEARNED THAT THOUSANDS OF GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE INCLUDING NUMEROUS ENTITIES WITHIN THE U. S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUFFER FROM A SINGLE ATTACK. AND WENT UNDETECTED FOR MONTHS. WHEN THE PUBLIC RESPONSE TODAY SB THIRTY SEVENTEEN THE GOAL WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU LUCK GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY MY NAME IS ALEX PARKIN AND I'M A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY- WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. IN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS FOURTEEN OF WHICH WERE WITH THE A LOS ANGELES COUNTY AUTO THEFT TASK FORCE WHERE HE SERVED AS THE DEPUTY IN CHARGE- ONCE AGAIN I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU ALL. ABOUT WHAT A BIG PROBLEM CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT AS WE ALL KNOW IT- IT'S A NATIONWIDE PROBLEM AND PROSECUTORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE ALL FACE THE SAME ISSUE. UNLESS THERE'S AN IDENTIFYING NUMBER ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO PROSECUTE THIS AS A CRIME- EVERYONE'S CAR HAS A- THE SERIAL NUMBERS COLUSA IN ITS ON YOUR DASHBOARD ANYBODY CAN SEE IT BUT WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS THAT ALL THROUGH THE INSIDE OF YOUR CAR. THAT VIN NUMBERS DUPLICATED ON EVERY IMPORTANT SYSTEM EVERYTHING THAT'S EXPENSIVE INSIDE YOUR CAR THAT'S WORTH STEALING HAS THE VIN NUMBER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A CATALYTIC CONVERTER- THE REASON THAT THAT THE- STAFF HAS EXPLODED LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE THE PAYS A LOT OF MONEY AND IT'S VIRTUALLY RISK FREE. UNLESS WE ACTUALLY CATCH THESE GUYS IN THE ACT IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT. FOR US TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. FURTHERMORE THE TAKE HIS PART THEY SELDOM A LOT OF MONEY A LOT FUN THE WAY- A- RECYCLER. AND DOES THE RECYCLE ALSO. BE HOW RESPONSIBLE FOR BY SCHOOL GOODS IDENTIFY NUMBER THERE'S NO THAT WE CAN. THAT THEY STOLEN- THE DATE- SENATOR UMBERG HIS- YOU KNOW PUT. ADDRESSES OF THESE ISSUES IT'LL HAPPEN. IN IF THE SHOULD GO INTO EFFECT IF THESE ARE CAUGHT WITH A FEW CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WE WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE MORE- ONCE WE CAN IDENTIFY THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. THE MARKET FOR THE STOLEN PARTS SHOULD COLLAPSE- CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT IS NEVER GONNA GO AWAY JUST LIKE ALL KINDS OF AUTO THEFT. WITH THIS BILL SHOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE PROBLEM- ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLEAGUES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE CONSIDERING SIMILAR APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING THESE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AND WERE URGING YOU TO DO TO SAY.

AND IT COSTS REAL HARDSHIP FOR THEM NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY OFTEN HAVE TO PAY HALF THE DEDUCTIBLE SOMETIMES ALSO SEE THEIR INSURANCE RATE INCREASE. BUT THE HARMFUL FACTOR OF HAVING TO REPLACE THE CONVERTER- LOGISTICALLY SPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK AT A JOB WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET TIME OFF FROM WORK AND- SHE LEFT THEIR CARD WHATEVER IT NEEDS TO GO TO BE REPAIRED- IT CAUSES WILL WELL PROBLEMS. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR- BURKE IN THE DRESSING THAT PROBLEM BOTH.

SKEWS ME TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION ANTHONY SAMPSON. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REYES ANTHONY SAMPSON HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION- YOU'VE HEARD THIS TESTIMONY ALREADY TODAY BUT- TO ENSURE THAT THE- THAT THE AUTHOR HAS THE BENEFIT OF HEARING MY REMARKS I'LL REPEAT THEM AGAIN HERE. THE NCAA HAS TAKEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB NINE EIGHTY SIX AND APPRECIATE SENATOR UMBERG'S WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH US REGARDING OUR CONCERNS. BURSAE IN CDA SUPPORTS THE UNDERLYING INTENT OF THE BILL AND TO THIS END CURRENTLY SUPPORTS OTHER CATALYTIC CONVERTER MEASURES FOCUSED ON INCREASED ENFORCEMENT. AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL C. N. CD'S CONCERNS RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO THE REQUIREMENT THE DEALERSHIPS PERMANENTLY MARK OR ETCH THE VIN NUMBER INTO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BEFORE VEHICLE CAN BE SOLD. WE'VE BEEN INFORMED. THAT SOME BELIEVE PERMANENT MARKING THE VIN NUMBER NUMBER IS SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE. WHAT IS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT MANY VEHICLE MODELS INCORPORATE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AS PART OF THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD REQUIRING DEALERSHIP TECHNICIANS TO DISASSEMBLE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE VEHICLE ENGINE JUST TO ACCESS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. BY JUST TWO EXAMPLES TO PERMANENTLY MARK ONE VOLVO MODEL WOULD TAKE DEALERSHIP TECHNICIANS TWO POINT EIGHT FOUR HOURS THE PERMANENTLY MARKED ONE VEHICLE DEPENDING ON ENGINE VARIANTS AND FOR CERTAIN ACURA MODELS IT CAN TAKE TWO TO FIVE HOURS. BUT EVEN ASSUMING PERMANENT MARKING THE VIN NUMBERS INTO CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WAS SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE WE WOULD NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT MANY OF THE MOST TARGETED VEHICLES ARE NOT EVEN BEING SOLD BY NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS. DATA FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF ONE LARGE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT THE MOST TARGETED VEHICLE IS THAT IT ARE THE 200-062-0009 PRIUS IS WHICH VERY FEW NEW CAR DEALERS EVEN SELL. RATHER THAN THOSE ARE OFTEN SOLD THROUGH PRIVATE VENDORS SELLERS LIKE RECKLESS EBOOK EBAY MOTORS. AND FACEBOOK MARKET PLACE YET SB NINETY SIX DOES NOT SEEK TO REQUIRE PERMANENT MARKING THROUGH THOSE FORUMS. WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AT THE SAME TIME C. AND C. D. A. WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH SENATOR- BURKE ON A MORE TARGETED SOLUTION WHILE ALSO ENSURING. THAT CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS ARE NOT SADDLED WITH THE LABOR INTENSIVE AND COSTLY OBLIGATION OF PERMANENTLY MARKING EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE THEY SELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR LET'S MOVE NOW MOVES FOLLOW ME ASK ANY FURTHER OPPOSITION WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY. THING NONE LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY. VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE MODERATOR.

MOBILE PHARMACY COULD HAVE COME TO THEM AND THEY COULD START THE MEDICATIONS IMMEDIATELY. IN ANOTHER EXAM. A PATIENT. HOMELESSNESS WITH EVALUATED BY A PHYSICIAN FROM THE STREET SCENE AND NEEDED TO GET A LIFESAVING MEDICATIONS AT A PHARMACY. HOWEVER THE PATIENT WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE HIS BELONGINGS UNATTENDED AT A HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT. AND COULD YOU TAKE EVERYTHING WITH HIM TO THE PHARMACY. THE PHARMACIST COULD COME WITH A MOBILE PHARMACY TO DISPENSE THE MEDICATION. ANSWER QUESTIONS TO HELP THE PATIENT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING THE MEDICATION AND PICKING UP CORRECTLY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SENATORS- FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK KAREN COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING MY OFFICE ON THE AMENDMENTS TO REFLECT IN THE ANALYSIS NUMBER OF THE PRESENT SENATE BILL TEN NINETY SEVEN CANNABIS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT THIS MEASURES BASED ON THE STATE OF THE ART SCIENCE AND HOW TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE KEY HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED CANNABIS. AND WHICH IS USED IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS FIRST REQUIRES RETAILERS PROVIDE FIRST TIME CONSUMERS A SCIENCE BASED DOUBLE SINGLE PAGE BROCHURE WITH A SIMPLE STEP SIMPLE STEPS RECEIVE FOR USE SECOND REQUIRES A ROTATING HEALTH WARNING LABEL ENCOURAGING CONSUMERS TO BUY LEGAL PRODUCTS AND EXPLAIN THE POSSIBLE HAZARDS OF ILLICIT CANNABIS AND THIRTY REQUIRES MORE PROMINENT ROTATING HEALTH WARNING LABELS BASED ON ESTABLISHED SCIENCE FOR CANNABIS PACKAGING. BILL ALSO SPECIFIES THAT THE ROTATING MESSAGES IS THAT DOES THE DESIGN FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT CATEGORIES FOR EXAMPLE IN HILL PRODUCTS WILL CONTAINERISED ANY MESSAGE AROUND HAZARDS OF SMOKING A PRODUCT WEARS ANIMAL PRODUCTS WILL CONTAIN A WARNING ON THE AFFECT THAT ON WHEN THE EFFECTS COULD START AND WHY WAITING. QUITE A WAIT BEFORE EATING MORE THE LABELING STANDARDS IN SB TEN NINETY SEVEN ALREADY USED IN CANADA AND ALIGN WITH SIMILAR INCOMING FTA PROVING CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE THEY TO TOBACCO LABELLING STANDARDS CURRENTLY THE LABELING ON CAMPUS PRODUCT IT'S HARD TO SEE AND INSUFFICIENT FOR EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ON HEALTH RISKS AND IF I USE A PROP SO YOU SAMPLED YOU CAN'T SEE VERY MUCH HERE. PRINT SMALL NOT KNOWING THE CURRENT HEALTH RISK COULD BE DETRIMENTAL PARTICULARLY FOR TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE MOST. VULNERABLE TO THESE HARMS AFTER TO PROSECUTE DIDN'T SEE. INCREASE IN CANNABIS USE AMONG CAL TEENS IN DAILY USE BY ADULTS THERE'S ALSO BEEN AN INCREASE IN THC CONTENT OR POTENCY OF THE CANNABIS PRODUCTS. USES THESE MORE POTENT PRODUCTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE NEGATIVE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS AND CAUSE HARMFUL CHANGES. TO DEVELOPING BRAINS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH UP UNTIL THEIR MID TWENTIES. WELL THE CURRENT LABELS MAY LIST THE HIGH THC CONTENT THEY DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT THE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THINK OF MENTAL HEALTH. WE MADE. AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL RESPONSE THE HELPFUL ISSUES. IDENTIFIED THANKS THE HELPFUL FEEDBACK BILL WILL NOT REQUIRE ANY INCREASES IN PACKAGING AND- AND FONT SIZE CAN BE SKILLED OF PACKAGES USUALLY SMALL. MAJOR NEW CAR SHOULD NOT BE KURDS AND THE WARNING LABELS WILL. CHANGE THE DESIGN EXISTING PACKAGING THE MUSCLE REPRINTED.

CAN YOU HEAR ME FINGERPRINT A GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB TEN NINETY SEVEN THIS BILL WOULD SUBJECT THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO DUPLICATIVE LABELING REQUIREMENTS CREATE EXCESSIVE NEW COSTUME LANDFILL WASTE AND IN PRACTICE DO A DISSERVICE TO THE CONSUMER. SB TEN NINETY SEVENS INTENDED OBJECTIVES TO DISCOURAGE YOUTH ACCESS IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CANNABIS PRODUCTS FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET ARE LAUDABLE HOWEVER WE FAIL TO SEE HOW SB TEN NINETY SEVEN WOULD MEET THOSE OBJECTIVES UNDER RECURSOS LEGAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO INCLUDE CLEAR AND EFFECTIVE WARNING LABELS THAT COMMUNICATE SCIENTIFICALLY ESTABLISHED HEALTH RISKS SB TEN NINETY SEVEN FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEW RECENTLY APPROVED PROP NIGHT SIXTY FIVE LABELING. MARC REQUIREMENTS WHICH ALREADY INCLUDE THE ADDITION OF THE WORD LEARNING NEW LANGUAGE ABOUT EXPOSURE TO SMOKE AND T. H. C. AND A LIST OF POSSIBLE CARCINOGENS BY NAME SB TEN NINETY SEVEN IS BASED ON A FLAWED PREMISE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ACCESSING LEGAL PRODUCTS WELL WE DO NOT DISPUTE THE FACT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ACCESSING CANNABIS PRODUCTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT COMMISSIONED BY THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR HIGHWAY SAFETY. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S OF CHICAGO MINNESOTA AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DID NOT FIND A SINGLE INSTANCE OF A LEGAL CALIFORNIA RETAILER ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL INTO THEIR PROMISES WITHOUT PROPER IDENTIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION OF TEN NINETY SEVEN WILL MAKE LEGAL PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE HIGHER COSTS TO PRODUCE LEGAL PRODUCTS WERE INEVITABLY RESULT IN HIGHER PRODUCT PRICES WITH CALIFORNIA'S ILLICIT CANNABIS MARKET ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH NEARLY EIGHT BILLION ANNUALLY SB TEN NINETY SEVEN WILL ONLY SERVE TO BOLSTER THE UNLICENSED CANNABIS MARKET. BY DRIVING MORE CONSUMERS TO THE ILLICIT MARKET UNDERMINING CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR THESE REASONS THE CIA RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES. SB TEN NINETY SEVEN. IF THANK YOU PLEASE.

AND RECOGNIZE AN ECHO CONCERNS ABOUT YOUTH CONSUMPTION HOWEVER WE'RE STILL HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM THAT THIS BILL AIMS TO SOLVE. OR ADDRESS BY THESE ONEROUS LABELING REQUIREMENTS. THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN ADDING DUPLICATIVE AND SOMETIMES. CONFLICTING LABELS WILL ONLY HURT THE INDUSTRY AND BOLSTER THE ILLICIT MARKET. COMPREHENSIVE A FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. PARTY REQUIRE WARNING LABELS AND CHILDPROOF PACKAGING FOR CANNABIS PRODUCTS SOLD BY LICENSED RETAIL. DEALERS IN THE STATE. SB TEN NINETY SEVEN ALONG INCREASED COSTS FOR ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATORS WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO COMPETE WITH THE ILLICIT MARKET. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THIRD ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTING HOW. THIS BILL WILL HAVE FINANCIAL AND LABOR IMPACTS TO LEGAL OPERATORS AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND ANOTHER IMPORTANT IN UNANSWERED QUESTION IS HOW WILL THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WORK. WITH THE EXISTING LABELS BROUGHT FORTH BY THE CURSOR AND PROP SIXTY FOUR- FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE A PART IN OPPOSITION. ENERGEN OVER TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THE PRIEGO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION AND ALSO THE COUNTY CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION TO SB CA NINETY SEVEN SURELY HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MR MODERATOR. LET'S NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE SENATE CHAMBER COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OR CONCERNS REGARDING SENATE BILL TEN NINETY SEVEN. OKAY SENATOR EGGMAN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU DR PAN- I ARE YOU HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ABOUT YOUR BILL AS I DO WITH A LOT OF BILLS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH LABELING CAN YOU I MEAN JUST FIRST TELL ME WHAT WHY THIS TWO PART WHY THE- THE HANDOUT WHICH SEEMS MORE REASONABLE. AND THEN THE LABELING AND WHILE THERE'S A LOT OF DETAILED INFORMATION. ABOUT SOME OF THE HARM THAT COMES NONE OF THAT REALLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF LABELING AND HOW LABELING WOULD INDEED HELP. AND THEN. THIS JUST JUST IMPACTS. THE LEGAL MARKET WHICH IS ONLY PLACE WE CAN IMPACT. WHICH IS ALREADY STRUGGLING AND BY DEFINITION IS MORE IS SAFER THAN THE ILLEGAL MARKET SO HOW DOES THIS CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR LEGAL MARKET. FUNCTIONAL THREE QUESTIONS HOW DOES COOPER LEGAL MARKET FUNCTIONING WHAT DATA DO WE REALLY HAVE ON THE IMPACTS OF LABELING. AND THERE WAS A STUDY FUNDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ON TO LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF LABELING AND WE STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT- AND THEN WIDE BY THE TWO PART APPROACH. OKAY THANK YOU FOR SUCH A QUESTION SIR AG MEN UP FIRST OF ALL I WANNA SAY THAT THE- YEAH WE ACTUALLY DO WANT TO DISCOURAGE USE OF ILLICIT CANNABIS AND- AND CERTAINLY- YEAH. WELL PART OF IT IS EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THE NOT JUST THE DANGERS CANNABIS BUT PARTICULARLY INCLUDING DANGERS OF ILLICIT CANNABIS NOW BELIEVE THAT THESE. LABELS ARE ALSO CITE THE ILLICIT PEOPLE CRY AND LIKELY TO PUT THE LABELS ON OTHER TECHNICALLY I THINK THEY COULD BE YOU KNOW ACTUALLY PROSECUTE THEY DON'T HAVE THE LABELS ON. BECAUSE THEY'RE SELLING CANNABIS IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHERS IS THAT THEY COULD BE PROSECUTED FOR. THE AND IN TERMS OF THE- EVENTS AROUND THE LABELING ITSELF WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE FROM EXPERIENCE WITH TOBACCO AND LABELING TOBACCO PRODUCTS- IN TERMS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LABELING PARTICULARLY DISCOURAGING- USE BY YOUTH- AND- BE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE DIFFERENT- CHALLENGES THAT ARE RAISED BY- TOBACCO IN AND IN THIS CASE- THAT CANNABIS THAT REASON FOR THE TWO STAGES IS THAT- CERTAINLY AGAIN I WILL KNOW WHEN. WE TOOK AMENDMENTS AND ALSO WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE LABELS AND LIKE THE WHOLE PACKAGE RIGHT SO YOU THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH INFORMATION YOU CAN PUT ON A LABEL BUT- TO BE SURE THAT. IT'S TIME CUSTOMERS DO YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT SAID PEOPLE MAY NOT BE AWARE. THAT THAT MODERN- CANNABIS OFTEN TIMES MORE POTENT THAN PERHAPS THAN. SOME PEOPLE WOULD USE IN THE PAST OR- ARE THAT- THEY REMEMBER TO HEAR FROM OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT PEOPLE HAVE UP TO DATE INFORMATION. WHICH WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD THAT YOU CAN. EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL IN A BROCHURE YOU KNOW I. HAVEN'T PUT IT ALL INTO A LABEL AND THE LABEL WOULD. BASICALLY KEEP POINT INTO ROTATING LABELS WELL. AND THIS BUT THE SCIENCE ON THE LABELING COMES FROM OUR EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE FROM. FROM LABELING AND TOBACCO. AND AND SO THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT TYPE OF LABELING FROM THAT EXPERIENCE. OKAY I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S ANALOGOUS TO TOBACCO BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A LEGAL AND ILLEGAL ILLICIT TOBACCO MARKET GOING AT THE SAME TIME. AS A LEGAL ONE AND IT WASN'T JUST THE LABELING WAS ALSO TAXES AND INCREASED IN A BIG. PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS OF. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER. OKAY I THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN SENTIMENT. THANK YOU MR SIX HUNDRED GRAND- FORTUNATELY FOR ME CENTER EGGMAN IS. EFFECTIVELY ARTICULATED A COUPLE OF MY QUESTIONS. AND TO HER POINT I GUESS IN IN RESPONSE TO YOUR REPLY. ONE OF THE POINTS MADE I THINK THAT'S COMPELLING TO ME BY THE OPPONENTS IS. IF WE'RE DISCUSSING USE BY YOU. WHAT WHERE WE'RE ALSO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DISCUSSING PRODUCTS WHICH BY DEFINITION- IF THEY ARE LEGAL WILL ONLY BE FOUND AND CAN ONLY BE PURCHASED BY ADULTS. IN LICENSES PRESSURES SO YOU KNOW THERE'S THE BROADER QUESTION ABOUT THE I GUESS THE SECONDARY USER SECONDARY EXPLOSIONS THE PRODUCTS- AND I'M- I AM AS WITH SUGAR WINNERS EARLY BILL. CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACTS ON THE LEGAL MARKET ESPECIALLY THE CITY AT THE APPARENT SUCCESS OVER TIME SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN OF US MARKET- AND SO FOR THAT REASON- I WILL BE STAYING UP THIS BILL TODAY- I DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO LIKE I DO THINK THERE IS A NEED. FOR CONTINUAL EDUCATION OF CONSUMERS TO TAKE YOUNG PEOPLE- BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE IN IN TALKING TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET. THEY'RE GLAD TO DO THAT IN GOOD FAITH- AND TO CENTER EGGMAN'S POINT YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR SOME DATA BACK. AS THE BEST PRACTICES- JOHN WITHHOLD MY DECISION ON THAT BASIS THANK YOU COMMENTS OR CONCERNS SENATOR MELINDA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SENATOR PAN RIGHT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT- YOU'RE BASING THIS OFF OF THE TYPE OF WARNINGS THAT WERE USED FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS- BUT I'M LOOKING AT A STUDY HERE FROM JAVA THAT SAYS. HE DID A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. SAYS THT THEY FOUND GRAPHIC WARNING LABELS DECREASED POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF CIGARETTES BUT WITHOUT CLEARLY INCREASING HEALTH CONCERNS AND THEY ALSO INCREASED QUITTING COGNITIONS BUT DID NOT AFFECT EITHER CIGARETTE SENSATION CESSATION OR CONSUMPTION LEVELS SO I'M JUST. IS THERE. WHAT STUDY IS IT THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO THAT SUGGESTS THAT PUTTING A WARNING LABEL NOT A GRAPHIC ONE LIKE- THIS STUDY SUGGESTS BY WHAT CITIES ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT. WHAT WOULD INDICATE THAT A WARNING LABEL FOR CANNABIS USE WOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT AT ALL ON. THE USER. WELL I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE GET ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT- BACK CANNABIS AND- EFFECT ACTUALLY THERE THERE'S DATA TO SHOW THAT- PEOPLE. ARE NOT NECESSARILY AWARE OF- BY THE NAME OF THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT WILL RAISE BY THE WITNESSES WHO ARE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT- WE ALSO NOTE THAT- THAT BASICALLY OURSELVES. THE WARNING LABELS ENSURE THAT- WELL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS PUT IN IS BEFORE THE USERS IN ADDITION TO OF COURSE THEY SAID THE THEY HAND OUT WHICH GOES INTO THAT CAN GO INTO A LITTLE MORE MORE IN DEPTH- THE- L. IT THERE IS- THE REASON LABELING IS A PUT ON TOBACCO IS BECAUSE- THERE IS OUT THERE. THERE'S BEEN FOUND TO BE IN COMBINATION I THINK I SHOULD MAKE NOTE THAT IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER EFFORTS EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS IT DOES HELP- THAT SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT- THE WELL CERTAINLY IT'S ILLEGAL FOR SOMEONE TO SELL CANNABIS TO USE. THAT DOESN'T STOP AN ADULT FROM POTENTIALLY PURCHASING- CANNABIS THANK INCINERATING- THIS PERHAPS SHARING IT WITH SOMEONE WHO'S YOUNGER AND. THE CERTAINLY- LABEL WOULD- INDICATE- PERHAPS IT MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A GOOD IDEA- SO THAT- THEY WOULD BE AWARE OF THE OF THE RISKS THAT. ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- BUT- I THINK THAT- ACTUALLY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK- BY A TECHNICAL SOMEONE- DUCTAL IN SILVER TO ADDRESS THE EVIDENCE BASED ON THE LABEL THAT IF THAT'S IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE. THAT SURE CERTAINLY DOCTOR. DOCTOR WHO THEY'RE WITH CAN YOU RESPOND. YES MICROPHONE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THANK YOU FOR THE- VERY PERTINENT QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY- SENATOR MELENDEZ IN REGARD TO YOUR QUESTION THERE'S A LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH ON WARNING LABELS- FOR TOBACCO- AND THE BALANCE OF THE EVIDENCE ON IS THE PICTORIAL WARNING LABELS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AND THAT THESE LARGER PROMINENT OF ROTATING MESSAGES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AT INFLUENCING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR INTENT TO CONSUME- AS WELL AS THEIR RECALL OF INFORMATION. SIMILAR STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE FOR CANNABIS BY GROUPS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO DAVID HAMMOND AND OTHERS- AS WELL AS WE HAVE OUR FIRST PAPER THAT'S BEEN DONE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN THAT'S CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW AND WE FOUND THE COMPARING HER IN CALIFORNIA LABELS TO THESE A STRONGER MORE PROMINENT PICTORIAL LABELS ON THE LATTER WERE. MORE EFFECTIVE- SO THERE'S A REASONABLE BODY OF EVIDENCE WHICH IS WHAT THE CASE OF TOBACCO HAS LED THE FDA TO ADOPT. THAT APPROACH- IF I COULD JUST INTERJECT HERE- THE BILL DOES NOT SUGGEST USING- GRAPHIC PICTORIAL TYPES OF WARNINGS CORRECT. DR PANDA'S OR IS THAT IS YOUR BILL INTEND TO USE GRAPHIC. PICTURES AS PART OF THE WARNING. NO OKAY BECAUSE I AND I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE RELATING TO PICTORIALS AND MORE GRAPHIC PICTURES WHICH AS I POINTED OUT IN THE IN THE DRAMA THEY'VE SAID THAT REALLY HASN'T HAD MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON PEOPLE EITHER QUITTING OR NOT STARTING IT AND IT MAKES THEM THINK ABOUT IT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON WHETHER THEY CONTINUE. TO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR AND THAT'S WITH THE GRAPHIC PICTURES SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CSE- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING MUCH MORE SUBDUED AND I'M STRUGGLING TO SEE WHAT THE- YOU KNOW I GUESS THE- THE ACTUAL OUTCOME WILL BE. IF IT DOESN'T HAVE AN EFFECT ON PEOPLE EVEN WITH GRAPHIC PICTURES AND THE WAYS THAT. YOU KNOW TOBACCO CAN HARM PEOPLE SO- THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THAT'S ALL I HAVE THANK YOU SENATOR HOLLINGS ANY FURTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. I SEE NO OTHER. MICROPHONES UP. SO DR PAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU I WAS GONNA ASK DR SILVER TO MAYBE ADDRESS THE ABSENCE OF GRAPHIC PICTURES BUT THAT'S FINE RIGHT- THANKS OVER WOULD YOU MIND AND I'LL CLOSE. MISTER CHAIR. THE CLARIFICATION THE BILL DOES CALL FOR PICTORIAL WARNING LABELS. SO THE NATURE OF THOSE. THIS IS NOT SPECIFIED BUT IT DOES INCLUDE PICTORIAL WARNING LABELS WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE STANDARD THE RESEARCH YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. FORGERS ARE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU FAIR SAID. AT KERN LABELS THAT ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED UNFORTUNATELY ARE USUALLY MESS ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED THE MATURITY IS A PROP COMBINED WITH FUN FILLED FUN COLORFUL- CHILD APPEALING PACKAGES LIKE THIS ONE. IN FLAVORS AND ALTHOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT WHEN THEY WERE FIRST ENACTED THERE'S GOING EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THEY DO NOT PROPERLY INFORMED CONSUMERS OF THE VARIOUS HEALTH RISKS. THIS MEASURE UP TO FIX THAT SB TEN NINETY SEVEN ABOUT CONSUMER SAFETY IN PARTICULAR SAFETY FOR TEENS YOUNG ADULTS WHO ACTUALLY ARE LEGALLY ALOWED TO PURCHASE. AN INFANT DURING PREGNANCY THEIR BRAINS ARE STILL DEVELOPING AND IT'S CLEAR SIGNS THAT CANNABIS CAN HAVE LONG TERM DAMAGING EFFECTS LIKE IMPOSING ADDITION MEMORY LOSS. COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND PSYCHOSIS AS YOU HEARD FROM THE WITNESSES. ELEVEN REQUIREMENT SB TEN NINETY SEVEN ARE BASED ON SCIENCE BUT SCIENCE SHOWS TO BE EFFECTIVE NOT ONLY FOR TOBACCO BUT FOR OTHER SIMILAR WARNING LABELS I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION WE MET WITH THEM WE UNDERSTAND THAT BOTH SIDES WANT TO ENSURE CONSUMER SAFETY. I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM AND COMMITTEE ON THE BILL SHOULD ADVANCE TODAY TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO OUR DEPEND RIVER MOTION ON SENATE BILL TEN NINETY SEVEN. SIDEROXYLON MOVES TO BE.

FINALLY NUMBER SIXTEEN SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT SENATOR ARCHULETA WELCOME YOU HAVE ONE BUILT PLEASE PROCEED IN READING THANK YOU MEASURE. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE STAFF WERE WORKING WITH ME ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA SEKOLAH THE PSYCHOLOGY COULDN'T ASSOCIATION PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION WOULD CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF REGISTERED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. A PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING TECHNICIANS PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING TECHNICIANS TO MEET THE GROWING NEEDS FOR CYCLE FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND NEUROLOGICAL SERVICES WHILE PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND PAYERS THESE TECHNICIANS WOULD OPERATE AS SERVICING CENTERS FOR THE PSYCHOLOGIST. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T GO BUT NINETEEN IS PUT SO MUCH PRESSURE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD ACROSS THE BOARD THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT MORE PERSONNEL ARE NEEDED TO CONTINUE WORKING AND DOING THE JOB THEY DO THE DEMAND FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL NEUROLOGICAL SERVICES HAS BEEN. STEADILY INCREASING UNFORTUNATELY STATE STATUTE DOES NOT DEFINE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND IN THIS IS THE ISSUE IN THE PRACTICE OF PSYCHOLOGY AND CREATING SIGNIFICANT DELAYS INTO AND TO ACCESS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING SERVICES THEY'RE OVERWHELMED THEY NEED THE HELP. CALIFORNIA IS ALSO EXPERIENCING A DIRE SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND GRAPPLING WITH MEETING THIS NEED ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH FOR CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO- IT'S ON TRACK TO LOSE AT LEAST ELEVEN PERCENT. OF A PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE NEXT DEFICIT DECADE AND THIS IS TOP PRIORITY AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH SCARCITY. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE RECEIVED DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURIES IN AFFECTED BY PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER AND REQUIRES SETTLEMENT IS PART OF THE LEGAL EDUCATIONAL PROCEEDINGS THEY RELY ON THE WORK BY THESE LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST. THE PSYCHOLOGIST REFORM BATTERIES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS THAT CAN VARY IN LENGTH DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE REFERRALS THEY CAN RECEIVE IT'S UNUSUAL AND IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO REQUIRE ONE TO TWO FULL DAYS OF FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- OF ADMINISTERING THE TEST. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST AND JUST FOR ONE SINGLE PATIENT SOMETIMES TWO TO THREE DAYS THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING TECHNICIANS TO ADMINISTER AND SCORE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND NEUROLOGICAL TEST UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF THE LICENSE I COLLEGES. THESE TECHNICIANS WOULD BE REGISTERED AND WELL READ REGULATED. BY THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY. THE USE OF IT TO PRIMARY ALLOWS THE PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS TO UTILIZE THEIR TIME. MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE PRODUCTIVELY FREEING THEM PRINT OUT TO ENGAGE IN OTHER INTERPRETATIONS AND- MEETING WITH THE PATIENT ONE ON ONE WHICH IS SO VITAL IN THE SERVICE OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT REQUIRES THEIR TIME. AND SKILL SET AS SUCH AS PROVIDING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CYCLE THERAPY AND REHAB TREATMENTS AND PLANNING CYCLE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ENGAGING IN RESEARCH AND TO REVISING PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATES. WITHOUT EMPLOYING TECHNICIANS THE MAJORITY OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE TIME IS SO SPENT IN ADMINISTRATION- DUTIES SCORE IN THE STANDARDIZED TEST THE RESULTS FOR WHICH IS THE PSYCHOLOGIST WORKING IN THE AREA THAT CAN BE MORE. USEFUL WORKING WITH PATIENTS OR SHOULD THAT TIME BE USED- CHECKING TEST WHICH THE TECHNICIAN CAN DO THIS BOTTLENECK IN SERVICE IMPACTS INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND UP AND OTHER DISORDERS IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE GIVE- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TO PROVISION. TO TAKE PLACE THE USE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING TECHNICIANS HAS BEEN ON NATIONALLY ESTABLISH STANDARD IN PRACTICE IN THE FIELD FOR DECADES BUT NOT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SO TEST. OF THE UTILIZATION TECHNICIANS IS PARALLEL TO OTHER LOCAL DIRECTORIAL LEVEL PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYING TECHNICIANS SUCH AS NEUROLOGISTS WITH THEIR EEGS AS THE TECHNICIANS AND RADIOLOGISTS. WITH X. RAY TECHNICIANS. PERSONNEL THAT. THE TOP PRIZE. PERSONNEL. AT LEAST TWENTY THREE STATES HAVE EXPLICIT LAWS ENABLING THE USE OF TECHNICIANS INCLUDING IN GOES ON ILLINOIS NORTH CAROLINA ACROSS THE BOARD THE LATEST IT NEW YORK AND CONNECTICUT. THE VA THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ALSO PERMITS TO USE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING TECHNICIAN SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT IT IS NOW TIME TO OPEN THE DOOR. TO TO OPEN THE DOOR THESE TECHNICIANS BUT THE FIELD IS VAGUE AND WE HAVE TO CLEAR THIS- SERVICE UP HERE WITH US TODAY WE HAVE DR WILLIAM MCCULLEN- WITH THE- CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION TO TESTIFY. AND COLIN CHAU INSURERS- ALSO WITH THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION THE ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. AND I THANK YOU FOR THE BY THE TIME- MISTER CHAIR AND- ESPECIALLY THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. FOR THE EFFORTS AND I HOPE THEY'RE STILL WITH US. WELL WE'LL CHECK THANK YOU SEE. I LIKE TO MAKE BUT MULLIN ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YEAHI AM CAN YOU HEAR ME PERFECTLY PLEASE PROCEED. RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR WILLIAM MCMULLEN I'M A PRACTICING BOARD CERTIFIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY CONCERNED FRANCISCO AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION TO SPONSOR OF THE BILL. WE'RE SPONSORING SB FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES BY ESTABLISHING A NEW REGISTRATION CATEGORY UNDER THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY OR PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING TECHNICIAN. THE USE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING TECHNICIANS AND SERVICE THEIR STANDARDS INTERNATIONALLY ESTABLISHED STANDARDS AND IS INCREASING USED ACROSS THE COUNTRY BY MYSELF WITH OBJECTING TECHNICIAN IN MICHIGAN IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES AND ADMINISTERED MANY TEST BATTERY. ADDITIONALLY WHILE OF PRE DOCTORAL INTERN AT THE CLEVELAND VA MEDICAL CENTER I WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE THE SERVICES OF THAT CASTING TECHNICIAN AND ONE OF MY ROTATIONS THERE AND THIS GREATLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY WILL PUSH HARD WORK. WELL THERE YOU CAN TESTING TECHNICIAN COMMON IN OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA MARKET IS FINALLY ON THIS ISSUE MEETING THAT PSYCHOLOGIST IN CALIFORNIA GENERALLY MUST ADMINISTER THEIR OWN TSK EVEN THOSE THAT ARE HIGHLY MANUAL LIGHT AND ROUTINE. THIS CAN TAKE AS MANY HOURS AFTER ONE TO TWO DAYS PER PATIENT AND THAT IS FINE BUT I COULD BE SPENDING INTERPRETING PATH LEADING UP RESULT IN PLANNING APPROPRIATE TREATMENTS FOR THE PATIENTS UNLOCK THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHING THE AUTHORITY TO USE BIOLOGICAL TESTING TECHNICIANS WHICH CLEARLY NEEDED. THIS LAW WILL NOT ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE IT WILL PROTECT PATIENTS BY REQUIRING SPECIFIED TRAINING AND PROVIDING FOR REGULATION UNDER THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY. THE EIGHTY HOURS OF TRAINING TWENTY FOUR ETHICS AND CONFIDENTIALITY TWENTY FOR OBSERVATION AND TESTING BY A PSYCHOLOGIST AND FORTY FOUR ADMINISTRATION AND SCORING IN THE PRESENCE OF PSYCHOLOGISTS WILL PREPARE THESE TECHNICIANS FOR PRACTICE. THE BOARD IS IN AGREEMENT THAT THIS NEW REGISTRATION CATEGORY IS VIABLE AND IS AMENABLE TO TAKING ON OVERSIGHT. AFTER REGISTRATION. THE NORTH ACROSS ARE UTILIZED TESTING FREQUENT IN MY- INTO THE BENEFITS OF BEING IN TO HAVE. TECHNICIAN JUSTICE ME ALLOWING ME OPERATE TO THE- UNDER MY STILL OF. AND SEE MANY CASE THAN I. DO CURRENTLY GREAT IS NOW IN THE TO MY WHEN I THIS IS TRUE THE MOST PART. AROUND THE ABILITY TO USE THAT TO. THE SICKNESS REDUCED TIME SPENDING AND OF PATIENTS AT THE BE SEEN BY ALLOW THEM TO INTO SCORING POWERS BE DONE THE TECH. THE CATEGORY ALSO IN. THE OF THE STATE MENTAL MORE. ONE PER THOSE UNDER. DEGREE IN. TO FIND EMPLOYMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE. E. I BELIEVE BUT THIS BILL IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO EXPAND TIMELY ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO PROVIDE A CLEAR LINE OF OVERSIGHT OF CASTING TECHNICIANS THROUGH THE BORDER TECHNOLOGY. AND WITH FURTHER THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGISTS TECHNICIANS AND PATIENTS AND DELIVERING THIS CARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR I THINK- YOUR OTHER. MEMBERS SIMPLY THERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS CORRECT. I'M HERE TO ANSWER I CAN OF MINE AND LEGISLATION HERE AS WELL OKAY. WELL LET'S MOVE TO OTHER WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY IN SUPPORT. SAYING NO WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY IN SUPPORT LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE ARVEST MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT THE INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WE WILL BEGIN. HE PUSHED ASIDE IN SUPPORT OF FOURTEEN TWENTY PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. I'M SURE HAVE NO ENTRY UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU IT'S ALL THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION FIRST WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE GALLERY. THING OF SUCH WITNESSES LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA THE TELECONFERENCE OF US IN OPPOSITION. MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT ANY INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. THE SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THEM. AND IF YOU WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE AND YOUR AT THE TIME. SURE WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU LET'S BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE CHAMBER- FIRST- DOCTOR PAN FOLLOWED BY A DOCTOR EGGMAN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- SENATOR ARCHULETA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE- PURPOSE OF TH BILL WHICH TO CLARIFY A IN IN THE CODE THAT- THAT PSYCHOLOGIST CAN USE TECHNICIANS TO HELP THEM DO TESTING IS DEVELOPED A BEAUTICIAN OF. THE LIVES MANY PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS AND WORK WITH THE CAUCUS SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND A PSYCHOLOGIST TO DO THOSE. I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU WHICH IS- IN THE ANALYSIS IS THAT- IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY HAVING TO REGISTER THEM ALL WITH. THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY- IS NOTED THERE MIGHT BE A OF. YOU KNOW. HOW MUCH A ONEROUS BUT BASICALLY. INCREASED EXPENSE AND ALSO THE- ALSO PERHAPS EVEN POTENTIALLY LIMITED NUMBER PEOPLE MIGHT BE DOING THIS SO. CAN YOU JUST ADDRESS WHAT IN ALICE'S SAID ABOUT TERMS OF- REGISTRATION AND- IS THIS SOMETHING THAT. THESE TECHNICIANS NEED TO BE REGISTERED WITH THE BORDERS IT'S SIMPLY ENOUGH THAT THEY HAVE A PSYCHOLOGIST WHOSE CERTAIN YOU KNOW SAYING THAT THEY'RE SUPERVISING THEM AND THAT THAT THERE OVERSEEING TO WORK AND THAT THEY'RE DOING ACCEPTABLE WORK. THANK YOU I UNDERSTAND IT'S ALL UNDER SUPERVISION BUT ALAS THE EXPERT TO- JOIN IN AND ANSWERED THAT QUESTION FOR ME. SURE AND HOLLINGER'S HERE AS WELL TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ON THAT- I THINK THE FEELING WAS THAT- WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING WITH PATIENTS- AND CURRENTLY EVERYBODY WHO THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY OVERSEES THE PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE ADDED TO THE PORTAGE BY CALLING HERE HAVING RESPONSIBILITY TO. ACT IN A MAINTAINER LICENSOR AND COMPLY WITH ALL REGULATIONS TO SOME PERSON BUYING I'M IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN THE- ANOTHER PROFESSIONAL- DOWN THERE SHOULD BE SOME OVERSIGHT BY THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY FOR EXACTLY HOW THIS IS DONE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT. CPA HAS BEEN WORKING AT WORKING THROUGH- I DON'T THINK IT WOULD NEED A LOOKS LIKE A VERY ONEROUS PROCESS IT LOOKS LIKE AND THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT. ALL ETHICS AND CONFIDENTIALITY EDUCATION IT NEEDS TO BE DONE WHICH I THINK IS ONLY ARE. YOU KNOW IN KEEPING WITH WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU ARE WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING AS PATIENTS ARE YOU KNOW VERY WELL OUR PRODUCT OF THE FACT THAT THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY AND SO ON. AND THE OVERSIGHT- THE THEY'RE TRYING TO KIND OF. TO WIN THE TO- MAKE HOURS- TOOLS HOUR THE PROVISION OF. PASS INCLUDING- OF BURKE. FOR CYCLE ARE- I THINK ARE THINGS THAT ARE. AND WILL BE RE. CONNECTIONS IS A TO MINISTER THE STAFF WHEN I WAS- A PSYCHOLOGY TESTING. AND IN MICHIGAN I MEAN I BEEN. I'M GOING TO COURTS WERE I HAVE I WAS ALREADY PROJECTS. OFFER CLINICAL. EXTERNAL AND A LOT THE TOP ARE LEARNED ADDITIONAL TESTING PRACTICE AND MICE- AND SO THIS- RED. ARE JUST PUTTING ARE KIND OF YOUR TO COLLEGE YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY LEARN HOW TO DO THAT. THE BATON TO YOU CAN DO. ACCURATELY AND RETURN WITH PETER LEE EXACTLY WANT TO SPECIFIC. FOR EACH OF THE NINE AND I'M SORRY I DON'T IT'S AN ALL PROCESS. APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AGAIN IT'S TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL MOVING FORWARD- I DID EIGHT NO THAT. WE DO SUNSET RE AND SO FORTH THE WORK ON OVER BORE. AND WHETHER THERE'S AN ASSESSOR FOR. THE THAT TECHNO THEY HAVE TO. DO MORE REGISTRY SO THINK THE ISSUES MORE THE BURDEN OF WORK ON TO THE BOARD AND NECESSITY OF THAT. FISHER QUA. OF WAS FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO BE SUPER. BY LICENSED. AS WELL SO BUT THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT'S REALLY SUPPORT THE BILL WE TRYING TO DO AND THE- VOTING FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR GRANT. THEY'RE EGGMAN. BUT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO CENTER ACTUALLY BRING THIS FORWARD. AND I GUESS MY QUESTIONS WERE KIND OF ON THAT SAME LINE. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DOING THIS FUNCTION. BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW IS PUT SOME REQUIREMENTS ON THEM. TO GET REGISTERED TO DO THIS FUNCTION. AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IF THERE'S A LACK OF. WORK FORCE IS INCREASING- THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS. WILL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FOLKS WE HAVE HELPING OUT OR DECREASE IT AND- MY FIRST QUESTION A FEW QUESTIONS YEAH I THINK IT WILL INCREASE. AND WHAT IT IS IT IN STATUTE THAT IT IS NOT EXPLICITLY SHOWN HOW THE TECHNICIAN CAN PERFORM. OR EVEN IF THEY CAN. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT LAW IN SOME OF THE OTHER STATES WE KNOW THERE IT IS LAW IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT EXPLICIT. THIS JUST BRINGS IT UP THIS SHOWS THAT USE A PSYCHOLOGIST YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT FIELD. YOU CAN HIRE YOUR TECHNICIAN TRAINING GUIDE. AND AS THEY GET CERTIFIED BY THE ASSOCIATION THEY COULD GO FORWARD WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS OPEN UP DOORS FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. WHO HAVE BEEN STUDIED PSYCHOLOGY AND AT THE MASTERS AND SO ON TO ENTER THE FIELD AND MAYBE NOT BE THE THERAPIST 1100% BUT- OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE THE GUIDE THE EIGHT AND SO ON. AND I I'D BE OUT QUITE HONESTLY I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE TESTING WOULD GO ON SO LONG. WHERE THAT PSYCHOLOGIST COULD BE ALREADY WORKING WITH THE PATIENT BUT THERE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME REVIEWING AND- LOOKING AT THE DOCUMENTS. WHERE THAT TECHNICIAN COULD HAVE JUST SAT THERE AND INTERVIEWED QUESTION AFTER QUESTION AFTER QUESTION AND THEN TURNED OVER THE RESULTS TO BE ANALYZED AND THEN IN TURN. THE PSYCHOLOGIST MEET ONE ON ONE WITH THE PATIENT AND WHERE THEY ARE DOING ONE OR TWO A DAY NOW THAT WOULD IT GO BUT OPEN UP MORE. IN BECAUSE THE VA IS ALREADY DOING THIS ISSUE TELLS ME THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR MORE AND THIS WILL JUST CLEAR UP THAT. VAGUENESS ABOUT IT BEING LEGALLY. ABLE TO BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY N. AND MAYBE TO THE TO THE WITNESS AS WELL BUT THERE ARE ALREADY PEOPLE PERFORMING THIS FUNCTION AS I UNDERSTAND IT. BUT THE LAW IS SILENT ON IT SO NOW WE'RE GONNA. WE'RE GONNA. WE'RE GONNA CREATE A LAW AND THEREBY ALSO CREATE THE SUPERVISION AND- THE REGISTRATION AND THE LICENSE IF YOU WILL TO REGISTRATION. AND THEN WHO'S IN CHARGE IS THAT THE IS THE PSYCHOLOGIST IN IN CHARGE OF. IS IT A ONE TIME REGISTRATION IS IT ONGOING IS THERE. THE C. E. IZARD A GRADUATION OR IS IT JUST A REGISTRATION AND THEN THAT PERSON IS READY TO GO AND HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT NOW. DESPITE JUST BEING REGISTERED. AND ALL THAT THE EXPERT- ENSURE THAT ONE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER CALLS WERE AS- WITH THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON WITH THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY ON TO THE FIRST PART YOUR QUESTION THAT'S A GREAT POINT- WE DON'T ACTUALLY TRACK WHO IS DOING THIS WORK RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OUR- CHIEF- CHIEF ORGANIZATION THAT. DEALS WITH OUR OVERSIGHT DOESN'T ACTUALLY TRACKED INFORMATION WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE THAN ANECDOTAL WE KNOW. THAT SOME VA CLINICS USE THEM. AND THERE IS SOME YEARS IN ACADEMIC SETTINGS BUT AS TERMS OF WIDESPREAD USE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT TO BE THE CASE- I AS THE SECOND POINT WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY ON DEVELOPING AMENDMENTS THAT WE LOOK ON TAKING AS THE BILL MOVES. THAT WOULD STREAMLINE THE CONTINUING EDUCATION PROCESS IN LINE WHAT WE DO FOR LICENSEES. ARE CREATING AN ANNUAL REGISTRATION PROCESS INCLUDING- INTAKE FORMS FOR LIFE SCANNED AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS MAKE OF LICENSEES- BUT ALSO ESTABLISHING A PROCESS BY WHICH INDIVIDUALS WHO OVERSEEING- ADEQUATE TRAINING AND EDUCATION AND OTHER STATES- MAY HAVE AN INTAKE PROCESS SO THEY CAN ALSO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING. AMENDMENTS WORKING WITH THE BOARD PSYCHOLOGY AND OBVIOUSLY WITH COMMITTEE WHO HAS DONE A GREAT WORK ON THIS BILL SO FAR. SO THAT ONCE WE DO GET FOLKS IN THE HOPPER. WHO WILL BE ABLE TO GET THOSE TECHNICIANS. ON THE JOB TRAINING AS PART OF THEIR KERR- IS PART OF THEIR EIGHTY HOURS OF REQUIRED TRAINING PROCESSES. IT THE CHAIR I CAN ASK SO IT IN THE REQUIREMENTS IS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T SPECIFY ANY. TYPE OF BACHELORS. YES IT DOES SO IN THE BILL AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER THE BILL. REQUIRES AT LEAST A BACHELOR'S IN PSYCHOLOGY OR RELATED FIELD SO OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE IN LINE WITH THE SOCIAL WORK MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY- BUT IT DOES REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN A- MENTAL HEALTH RELATED- DEGREE. IT CAN ALSO BE A MASTERS AS WELL THAT'S IN THE STATUTE BUT AT LEAST A MINIMUM OF BACHELOR'S DEGREE. THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR DID I HEAR YOU TO SAY THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TESTING TAX ARE UP THERE. IN CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS OFFICES. ASSISTING THE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST. AT MISS HERE I'M NOT AWARE THAT THERE'S ANY THAT WILL ADMIT TO THAT FACT BUT I'LL LET AGAIN THE EXPERT TO ANSWER THAT WHOSE- AS A PULSE ON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- COLLINS WORSE AGAIN SO NONE OF OUR MEMBERS- WHEN WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS OVER SEVERAL YEARS ON THIS ITEM INTERNALLY- WE DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE THAT ACTUALLY USES TECHNICIANS BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD PRETTY CLEAR DIRECTION FROM A REGULATORY BOARD THAT. THIS PRACTICE IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER LAW- BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S CONTRARY TO THE ANALYSIS YOU UNDERSTAND WELL I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE ANALYSIS TAKE HOWEVER I WILL SAY THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. HAVE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP- THAT THE USAGE OF THESE TECHNICIANS IS WE DON'T SEE AS BEING PERMITTED UNDER THE LAW- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHERS WHO DO USED TECHNICIANS- IF THAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE IT'S ANECDOTAL- BUT THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY NOR CPA COLLECT ANY INFORMATION OTHER USE TECHNICIANS. WITH THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T COLLECTED DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NOT IN USE CORRECT. IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE CENTER I CAN'T SPEAK TO ALL THE PRACTICING PSYCHOLOGISTS HOWEVER I WILL SAY THE FOLKS IN OUR NEUROPSYCHOLOGY DIVISION OF WHICH- DOCUMENT MULLIN IS A MEMBER- WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANYONE WHO IS ACTIVELY. THESE FOLKS WITHIN THE PRACTICE. WITHIN THE LAST AT LEAST HALF DECADE. SO WITH RESPECT TRANSACTION EDUCATION. GO AHEAD PLEASE STEPANEK FALLING APART I JUST WANTED TO JUMP IN THE YOU KNOW CONTRAST THIS WITH HOW THINGS IN OTHER STATES IF IT WAS IF I AND MY COLLEAGUES VIEWED US AS BEING ACCEPTABLE FROM THE BY THE BOARD AND LEGAL- I WOULD ALREADY BE USING ONE- WHEN I WAS IN ANOTHER STATE I WAS USING ONE IT MAKES THE PRACTICE SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT BUT IT'S HIGHLY DESIRABLE THAT WE COULD USE ONE. BUT IN CALIFORNIA IT'S- IT'S CLEAR THAT- AT LEAST THE-PERCEPTION ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY REPORTERS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT- IT IS- IS TO BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO CLARIFICATION ON. IT WILL JUST NEED TO SCALE HERE'S MY HERE'S MY PROBLEM I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH USING THE LICENSE REGISTRATION. RECOGNITION PROCESS. WHERE IT'S NOT AB REQUIRE BECAUSE IS THE ANALYSIS OF DATA. AND I FOR BELIEVE. THESE RULES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE- CAN SERVE AS A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT AND THEY'RE A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT. VERY MUCH FOR THE FOR THE PIECES IN PORTIONS OF THE POPULATION THAT WE OFTEN CARED THE MOST AND FIGHT THE MOST FOR. HERE IN THIS FLOOR THE DISADVANTAGED AND THOSE WHO COME. FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND SO I REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THESE REQUIREMENTS IN THESE REQUESTS FOR REGISTRATION OR RECOGNITION. OF VERY SERIOUSLY FOR EXAMPLE THE REQUIREMENT FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WAS THAT YOU ALL ARE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS AND- IN AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WAS THAT VALIDATED IN SOME WAY BY A STUDY. IN OTHER WORDS WHAT TASKS ARE THESE TESTING TAX GOING TO PERFORM. THAT WOULD REQUIRE NECESSARILY A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY AND IS IT A DEGREE IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY IS IT A DEGREE AND- IN THE OTHER DISCIPLINES WITHIN THE PSYCHOLOGY FIELD AND IF SO WHY. MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN GO AHEAD- DOCUMENT MULLIN. I WOULD SAY THAT AND THE REASON THAT TAX IN THERE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT SORT OF STANDARD ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEN IT'S BEEN RECOMMENDED BY OUR PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND KNOWS THE COLLEGES THAT- ACTUALLY TECHNICIANS ARE HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND BE TRAINED UP BY THE PSYCHOLOGY I THINK YOU'RE A STRAPLESS THING- YOU KNOW SENATE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE IT. AS A BARRIER TO OUR- HI THIS IS THE BILL ACTUALLY ON- LIKE TO THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN. HEALTH BECAUSE IT'LL BE MORE PEOPLE THIS THIS POINT. IF THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE USING TACTIC TESTING TECHNICIANS ADDITION A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF WHAT WILL BE AND WHAT WILL END UP HAPPENING IF- IF AND WHEN. THE BILL PASSES AND LOOKED IN THE STATUS OF TESTING TECHNICIANS IS CLARIFIED BECAUSE WITH DISAPPOINTING. YOU KNOW I WOULD. MENTION CLARIFIED I WOULD DEFINITELY- YOU KNOW ADVERTISED. TO HIRE IS TESTING TECHNICIAN I WOULD GET FROM MY EMPLOYER TO DO SO I'M AND I THINK A LOT OF PLACES WHERE THERE'S JUST A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING BUSINESS AND SO I THINK IT WOULD GENERALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. DOING THIS WORK WELL YOU KNOW IN THE EMPLOYMENT FIELD. FIFTY PRETTY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE SET QUALIFICATIONS BECAUSE IF YOU SET THE QUALIFICATION OF A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FOR EXAMPLE. WITHOUT DIRECTLY TYING IT TO THE SKILLS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO DO THE JOB. THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE AT LEAST HISTORICALLY IT TENDS TO DISCRIMINATE. AGAINST MINORITIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THAT'S WHY AS MIKE. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR BROTHER DEGREE REQUIRED. HAVE YOU HAD ANY COMPLY WITH AS I'M ASSUME SOME AROUND SOME IS BEEN ASSISTING A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST SOMEWHERE IN CONDUCTING TESTS NOT INTERPRETING THEM BUT CONDUCTING THEM. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY COMPLAINTS ANY COMPLAINTS OF HARM ADDRESSED TO THE BOARD AS A RESULT OF A TESTING TAX SOMEWHERE. OR WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT AN INTERN OR A PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSISTANT- CONDUCTING THESE TESTS WHERE. ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT WOULD BE CALLED FOR. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE- IN CONVERSATION FOR PSYCHOLOGY NOT RECEIVED ANY OF THAT INFORMATION. WELL THEN I HAVE ANOTHER ONE AND I'LL TY TO WRAP IT UP- WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR WRONG. AND THERE ARE TESTING TECHS OUT THERE. IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA ASSISTING. PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTY TO MAKE THEIR WORK DAY MORE EFFICIENT AND I'M- FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. WHO DON'T MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR GRADUATE DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY. EIGHTY HOURS OF TRAINING AND ON AND ON BUT HAVE BEEN PERFORMING THE DUTIES. OF THEIR POSITION FOR TEN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS. IS THERE SOME PROVISION IN THIS. BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO BECOME. GRANDFATHERED SO THEY ARE GRANDFATHERED WHATEVER THE PROPER TERM IS THESE DAYS SO THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO PERFORM THEIR- THEIR JOBS WITHOUT. UNDUE INTERFERENCE WITH THEIR ABILITY TO GENERATE A WAGE MISTER CHAIR- PART OF THE WHAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO ON THIS BILL AS IT MOVES IS WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY TO FIND OUT IF THERE ARE THOSE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON- EXTERNAL MESSAGING TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THOSE FOLKS ARE IN PRACTICE THEY CAN REACH OUT TO US. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY AMENABLE TO WORKING ON TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD GRANDFATHER IN INDIVIDUALS WITH A CERTAIN BASE LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING OR AS- MAKES SENSE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THESE NATIONAL STANDARDS- BUT AS YET WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANY INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM PRACTICING. BY THE INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE OF THIS BILL I STILL THINK YOU NEED YOU MAY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK. AT THE STANDARDS THAT YOU PLUGGED INTO THE BILL IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO ARTICULATE WHY YOU'VE PICKED. A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WHY YOU'VE PICKED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS AND INSTEAD OF SIMPLY INCLUDED THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SOME OTHER STATE DID I THINK. WE PROBABLY. MAYBE MORE EXACTING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE WAY WE SET OUR STANDARDS. I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- OF WE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. AS HE MOVES A BILL FORWARD I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT STRANDING. WORKERS ANYWHERE BY SETTING NEW STANDARDS AND NOT PROVIDING. FOR A PATHWAY WERE OFFERING UP FOR THOSE WORKERS TO. CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR WHATEVER PERIOD OF TIME THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT. SENATOR MELENDEZ THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN- I JUST WANT TO. GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST SAID WITH RESPECT TO- GRANDFATHERING IN. THOSE WHO MAY ALREADY BE DOING THIS- TYPE OF WORK YOU SAID THAT. YOU ARE WORD I MEAN A BOWL TO MAKING SOME AMENDMENTS PERHAPS DOWN THE ROAD PROVIDED THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAD THE MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS WHICH TO ME SAYS THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE SO THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE GRANDFATHERED IN UNLESS. THEY YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF THERE'D THEIR STOCK CAN YOU JUST GO BACK TO THAT PLEASE CERTAINLY SO I WHEN I WAS TRYING TO REFERENCE IS NOT NECESSARILY A MINIMUM OF BACHELOR'S DEGREE BUT- TO ESTABLISH SOME MINIMUM STANDARD FOR FOLKS WHO MAY BE DOING THIS WORK SOMEWHERE. OUT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DETERMINE WHAT AN APPROPRIATE MINIMUM STANDARD WOULD BE ALONGSIDE OR LIKE YOU- REGULATOR AND THE COMMITTEES OF BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE SO I WASN'T ATTEMPTING TO. MAKE A STATEMENT THAT IT HAD TO BE OUR MINIMUM STANDARDS BUT IF THEY ARE OUT THERE PRACTICING WE WOULD NEED TO ESTABLISH SOME MINIMUM FROM GRANDFATHER OKAY THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT BECAUSE I'M- I FEEL FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT WE DO HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALREADY PERFORMING. THESE TASKS IN CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD HATE TO. BE PARTY TO A BILL THAT. ESSENTIALLY CUTS THEM OUT OF EMPLOYMENT UNLESS THEY GO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR THEIR- BACHELORS OR WHATEVER IT IS DETERMINED IS NECESSARY FOR THIS WORK SAID THANK YOU SO MUCH.
