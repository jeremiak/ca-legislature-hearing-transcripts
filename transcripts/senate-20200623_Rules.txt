I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EACH OF YOU FOR CONSIDERING THE CONFIRMATION OF MY APPOINTMENT AS INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CALTRANS. I KNOW YOU HAVE MY RESUME BEFORE USE SO I WILL BE BRIEF AND FOCUS ON LAND INTERESTED IN THIS POSITION. I HAVE A DEGREE IN MANAGEMENT FROM SAINT MARY'S COLLEGE OF. CALIFORNIA I HAVE MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF STATE SERVICE WITHIN TRANSPORTATION MOST OF THAT TIME HAS BEEN SPENT IN A LEADERSHIP CAPACITY. WITH INCREASING RESPONSIBILITIES OVER THE YEARS. INCLUDING MY PREVIOUS POSITION AS DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF TRAFFIC SAFETY WHERE I ADMINISTERED A NEARLY NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TRAFFIC SAFETY GRANT PROGRAM. IN THIS CAPACITY THE OFFICE THE TRAFFIC SAFETY IS ALREADY EVERY THREE YEARS BY THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION SO I FEEL LIKE I HAVE. A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO SEE CLEAR AND CONCISE INFORMATION THAT IS USEFUL AND PROVIDES THE KIND OF FEEDBACK IS NECESSARY FOR YOU TO MAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION. IF NECESSARY. WALGREENS GRAVITATED TO POSITIONS WHERE I COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE FROM LEADING TEAMS ESTABLISHED TO STREAMLINE IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITY. AFTER BEING ALONG WITH STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS THAT I BELIEVE ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS POSITION. SB ONE EMPATHIZES ACCOUNTABILITY IN TRANSPORTATION IN TRANSPARENCY FOR THE TIME BEING GRAMS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATION. SPECIFICALLY THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE EDUCATION WAS CREATED TO ENSURE THAT CALTRANS AN EXTERNAL IN ENTITIES WHO RECEIVED STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING ARE USING THOSE FOR THE- SHE IN AN EFFECTIVE. EFFICIENT AND COST EFFICIENT MANNER. IT IS USED IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS HOW WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY ISSUING OUTSTANDING PRODUCTS THAT ARE TIMELY. ACTIVE BALANCED IN PRESENTED IN SUCH A WAY TO BE ABLE TO ACT ON INFORMATION TO BAIT. WE CAN ACTIVELY IDENTIFY REPORT BEST PRACTICES. OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN INTERNAL CONTROLS WE CAN ADD VALUE IN PROVIDE INFORMATION TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND COST REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS ENHANCE DECISION MAKING THAT PROMOTES ACCOUNTABILITY. IN CLOSING ACCOUNTABILITY IS KEY TO MAINTAINING PUBLIC TRUST. FOUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND EXCELLENT WE CAN FOSTER AND PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY AND INTEGRITY MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS CRAFT I THINK I'M GONNA LOOK. IN THIS DIRECTION AND START WITH SENATOR MINING. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- CONGRATULATIONS INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT HAS A NICE RING TO IT DOESN'T IT- WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE YOU HAVE. MANY YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR THAT SERVICE- PRIOR TO THIS APPOINTMENT WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION YESTERDAY I THINK ONE THING THAT WOULD PERHAPS BE OF INTEREST. TO OUR PANEL IN THE PUBLIC- ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT MAY GET TOO TECHNICAL TOO FAST BUT- PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICES AS I UNDERSTAND IT WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE. AND OVER FIVE BILLION A YEAR ANTICIPATED FOR ROAD REPAIR ROAD MAINTENANCE OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION DEVELOPMENT- IS FOR YOUR OFFICE TO. ALSO LOOK AT THE FISSION SEES SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCIES. IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY IS HOW- WITHIN EXISTING PROGRAMS WHERE THERE'S AN ASPIRATION FOR SAVINGS. HOW DO WE MOVING FORWARD DETERMINE IF WE'RE GETTING BETTER AT THAT OR MAYBE JUST SHARE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOW YOU MEASURE OF EFFICIENCY VERSUS SAVINGS. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT QUESTION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YESTERDAY AND I APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU. SO I THINK IT BE HELPFUL IF I KIND THEY WOULD DESCRIBE. HELLO MY HOT OFFICE INVOLVED WITH EACH EFFICIENCY. AND THIS MY OFFICE REVIEWS THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PROCESSES AND METHODOLOGIES USED BY CALTRANS. COURT REPORTING SERVICE. SO THESE THESE ARE INDUSTRY STANDARDS USED BY MANY DOT'S THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND REQUIRE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TO BE THERE EVERY STEP. OF THE PROJECT. ANY END THESE ARE THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE USE AND TO REVIEW IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE MET THE RECORDED SAVINGS THAT THEY HAVE INDICATED AND IT IS DURING THIS PROCESS THAT WE BELIEVE IS HELPFUL IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE HAVING THE PERFORMANCE IN THE OUTCOMES THAT IS EXPECTED OF SH BACKED IT WAS THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EFFICIENCY REPORT. THAT THERE WAS AN OVER REPORTING IN SO WE ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT WE USE. IN ORDER TO REVIEW. THE EFFICIENCY AND THE METHODOLOGY THAT IS USED BY CALTRANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH XIN IN IT WAS WITH REFERENCE TO THAT EARLIER REPORT THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU HELPED ME TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IN IN HOW YEAR OFFICE IS EQUIPPED TO IDENTIFY AN OVER REPORTING. OF A SAVINGS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT IN- AGAIN I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY I DON'T HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS TODAY- BAIT AGAIN- MADAM INSPECTOR GENERAL WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND POLLACK FOR DEVOTING FOR YEAR CONFIRMATION TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU BOB MADAM INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT'S KIND OF A NEAT TITLE IS LYNETTE BACK TO BE WEARING A UNIFORM AROUND HER HOUSE BUT NOT REALLY BAD SO I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR APPOINTMENT TO VERY VERY IMPORTANT POSITION IN SOMETHING THAT WENT INTO SB ONE I THINK THAT I WAS VERY MUCH A BI PARTISAN AND DESIRE TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS THE INDEPENDENCE FROM CALTRANS AND WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF ON THE THINGS THAT OF SENATOR MONNING MENTIONED. REGARDING THAT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN PARTICULAR LEAVE MEETING THE EFFICIENCIES THAT WERE HOPE FOR IS- WE LOOK AT TODD THOSE VERY PRECIOUS DOLLARS GOING TO OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM SO I MY QUESTION IS GOING TO FOCUS ON YOUR INDEPENDENCE FROM CALTRANS AND WHAT- SEASON PROCEDURES YOU MAY HAVE THE IMPLEMENTED OR ARE CONSIDERING HIM FOR BEING TO ENSURE THAT YOU DO HAVE THAT. IF A MEASURES SO PERHAPS CANDLE IF YOU FEEL YOU NEED MORE TOOLS AND THINGS THAT WILL ENSURE THAT THE OFFICE OF HE HAS A VERY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH CALTRANS BUT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE THERE TO LOOK AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MEETING THE TASKS THAT WERE SET BEFORE THEM THROUGH SB ONE. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT AND YOUR BATES- I THINK UP START OUT BY TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE OFFICE PRIOR TO YOU. SB ONE AND THAT IS THAT IT WAS AN INTERNAL ORGANIZATION WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON CALTRANS MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES. AND NOT IT'S WE'RE PERFORMED ON DEMAND MANAGEMENT DISCRETION. THE HIGHER LEVEL OF EXPECTATIONS UNDER SB ONE REQUIRES AYE AYES TO SHIFT TO A MORE INDEPENDENT. RISK BASED ORGANIZATION FOR FOCUSED ON PERFORMANCE OUT. SO THESE OPTIONS IT'S CRITICAL TO FOR ME TO BEGIN WITH IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING THE INDEPENDENCE THAT EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT IN DIRECTION ON BECAUSE THIS IS A CHANGE IN TERMS OF THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE THERE PREVIOUSLY. JOINING THE ORGANIZATION YEAH FOCUS FOR ME RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING INDEPENDENCE IN HELPING THE STAFF TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS FOCUSING ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION OUR WORK PRODUCTS COMMUNICATION. PRODUCT TO BE TOOLS IN ADDITION THE OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS FOLLOWS THE YELLOW BOOK STANDARD. YELLOW BOOK STANDARD DEEPER BY FOUR AND REQUIRE A LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE WORK OF THE AUDITORS AND THE WORK THAT TO BE OUT OF IT. THERE ARE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS CONTINUING EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS THE OTHER THING STAFF TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING THOSE THINGS AND IT ABSOLUTELY IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE YELLOW BOOK STANDARD AND FOR US TO FOLLOW SH SO THE INDEPENDENCE I THINK SHE IS VESTED WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS THAT ARE FOLLOWED BY THE OFFICE. I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE. HOPING THE STAFF TO UNDERSTAND THE SEPARATION OF THOSE DUTIES OR THAT RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK THAT I WOULD JUST STOP THERE IN TERMS OF THE INDEPENDENT SUGGESTS THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF THAT INDEPENDENCE- BUT IT IS ALSO IN HERE IT IN THE STANDARDS THAT ARE FOLLOWED BY MY OFFICE IN TERMS OF THE CONDUCT OF. IT SHOULD BE. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND THAT CERTAINLY GOES TO THE HEART OF ALL THE THINGS THAT I WAS LOOKING OUT OF I'M LOOKING OUT TO THE NEW THE NEW ARE POSITIONED IN CERTAINLY WHAT YOU BRING TO THAT POSITION SO I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO SERVICE NOTICE YOU ARE TAKEN SAFETY AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THAT'S HOW I STARTED MY CAREER INTX BEING. THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE DIESEL NO DOUBT T&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; IS A VERY IMPORTANT JOB EVEN OUT THE VERY SIMPLE LEVEL IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND YOU I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR CALTRANS AND CERTAINLY OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THEY WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR- OUR- A GREAT. TO IT AND THAT WE HAVE THE SO THREE SHEET THAT AND YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION THANKS AGAIN. IN HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. BECKY AT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR EMPLOYMENT SO I LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON. SENATOR BATES QUESTION. SO WE'VE NOW SWITCH FROM THIS INTERNAL TO THIS EXTERNAL SO IS A MAJOR PARADIGM SHIFT AND COURSE. TRANSPORTATION VERY LARGE CHAU ORGANIZATION SOME JUST CURIOUS IN TERMS OF HOW YOU WHAT CRITERIA DO YOU USE TO PRIDE PRIORITIZE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS. WELL INVESTIGATIONS ARE PRIOR TO PRIORITIZE BASED ON THE JUST LAST SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD QUESTION- BASICALLY WHAT WE DO IS WE LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A THREAT TO. PUBLIC SAFETY. OBVIOUSLY IF WE SEE ANY ISSUES LIKE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE PRECEDENCE- WE ALSO WORK ALONGSIDE A SEAT IN STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS U. S. D. O. T. ON ISSUES OF CONCERN. SOMETIMES THOSE ISSUES TAKE PRECEDENT OVER OTHERS- AND CALTRANS THEY CAN BRING THINGS TO OUR ATTENTION- THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY AROUND. IN WHAT I THINK WHAT I THINK IS HELPFUL IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE. IS THAT IT THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN. OUR INDEPENDENCE AND ALSO BEING AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS. URGENT ISSUES THAT CALTRANS MAY BE AWARE. OF THAT MAYBE WE GOT BUT I THINK THAT THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE. LENDS ITSELF TO A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP BUT STILL ALLOWING US TO BE SEPARATE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN MAKE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON. THANK YOU FOR THAT AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON APPOINTMENT AND FOR YOUR LONG STANDING SERVICE MADAM CHAIR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE CONFIRMATION.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MS NORTON SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU MAN PRO TEM- CONGRATULATIONS VENTURE. HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND A WELL DESERVED A NOMINATION. I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT- WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND WE DID NOT A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT WE HAD A WE HAVE HAD AN ISSUE. INVOLVING THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. AND AS YOU KNOW- THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM IS IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO SP ONE AND IT WAS CARRIED OVER- WITH SP ONE AND AS- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROGRAM LOCAL COUNTIES WERE. INCENTIVIZE TO PASS A LOCAL TAX MEASURE FOR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING AND THEN THE LOCAL A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM PROVIDED MATCHING FUNDING. OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAS LONG BEEN A SELF HELP COUNTY AND CONTINUES TO BE ONE. HISTORICALLY THIS L. P. P. p5% ALLOCATION FORMULA. THOSE OF US WHO VOTED FOR SB ONE CERTAINLY THIS SENATOR ASSUMED THAT THAT HISTORICAL FORMULA WOULD CONTINUE ON WITH SB ONE. IN THE- SP ONE WAS NOT SPECIFIC AS TO THE FORMULA ALLOCATION FOR THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. FUNDS THAT WERE THAT FLOW THROUGH TO THE PROGRAM AFTER THE VOTE. SOMETIME AFTER THE VOTE SOME OF US WERE INFORMED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT IT WAS NOT THE ADMINISTRATION'S AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE THIS STORE PRACTICE INSTEAD TO GIVE THE CTC FULL DISCRETION. YEAH HOW TO ALLOCATE THE MONEY. BUT THAT WAS SOMEWHAT BOTHERSOME TO SOME OF US THERE WAS SOME LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS- BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO. FIX A FORMULA OR AT LEAST A FORMULA RANGE WHICH WERE. FIND SUCCESSFUL WHEN THE EFFORTS REACHED THE HORSESHOE. AND OF COURSE THAT'S THE GOVERNOR'S PROVOCATIVE BUT WHAT I WOULD ASK AND IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CDC HAS THE DISCRETION IN THE AUTHORITY TO SET THAT ALLOCATION FORMULA BUT WHAT I WOULD ASK OF YOU IN YOUR CAPACITY. AS THE CDC COMMISSIONER AND AS CHAIR WHEN YOU ARE CONFIRMED AND I FULLY INTEND TO SUPPORT THE CONFIRMATION AND IN FACT. MAKE THE MOTION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU AND YOUR FELLOW COMMISSIONERS TAKE THE- HISTORICAL PRACTICES AT LEAST. INTO ACCOUNT IN MAKING DECISIONS WITH THE- WITH REGARD LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE. AND THAT'S MY COMMENT AND THAT'S MY REQUEST AND WITH THAT. CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN I LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING THAT MOTION THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM. THANK YOU ARE MISSING DO YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT BEFORE I GO TO OUR VICE CHAIRMAN. I THINK. I BECAME UC CTC COMMISSIONER AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ALLOCATION FORMULAS HAD OCCURRED I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND I TAKE. SENATORS REQUEST VERY SERIOUSLY AND IT WILL BE PART OF OUR CONSIDERATION AS WE WORK WITH THIS NEW SET OF GUIDELINES AND OUR NEW REVIEW A PROJECTS AND I'D LIKE TO MEET WITH. FOUR WE FINISHED THOSE REVIEWS AND TO TALK FURTHER ABOUT HIS CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OKAY CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT AND WILL BE SUPPORTING YOU I WILL NOT BE MAKING THE MOTION BECAUSE CENTER ROTH. HAS THAT HONOR I DO BUT I REALLY JUST ONE MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL I WANTED THANK YOU FOR YOUR STRONG APPLICATION FOR MORE COMMUTER RAIL ON MITCHELL LINKS ON NORTHERN EL COUNTY TO DOWNTOWN LA. ALREADY KNOW THE FOURTEEN FREEWAYS ALREADY. BURDENED AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CCAC PROJECTIONS FOR HOUSING IT'S ALL COMING TO NORTH COUNTY I'M NOT SURE HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THAT GROWTH. BUT ONE WAY OBVIOUSLY IS INCREASE COMMUTER RAIL SO I KNOW YOU'RE A STRONG ADVOCATE ON THAT. IT'S SOMETHING NEAR TO DEAR TO MY HEART THAT YOU BEEN AND JUST A LEADER ON IS IN THE MODERNIZATION. HI FIVE THROUGH NEW HALL PASS. EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM AND EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT YEAH STANDS SIMPLE THE I. FIVE RIGHT IT'S THE- BC TO BC BARK. TO BRITISH COLUMBIA BUT THE CHOKE POINT IS THERE THE NEW HALL PASS IN THE SENATE CREATIVE ALLEY. SO UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THE THINGS THAT HAVE. THAT HAVE HAPPENED ARE GONNA HAPPEN. THAT INCREASES THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR. MY CONSTITUENTS PERCENTER STEARNS. AND BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT- THE GOODS MOVEMENT WHICH IS IMPORTANT. TO OUR ECONOMY SO AGAIN I HAVE NO QUESTIONS FOR YOU MATTER CHAIR AND A LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS. AND THANK YOU MISTER VICE. ARE THE SENATOR BATES IN YOU THANK. ON THE ME AB. ON TO MY COLLEAGUES AND WHEN I READ YOUR RESPONSES TO. THE QUESTIONS- MISS NORTON I SAID HERE'S A PERSON AFTER MY OWN HEART YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING AT SYKORA. SO THAT CAN BE STREAMLINED FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS BECAUSE IT WAS ALWAYS DISTURBING TO US OUT IN THE- OUT IN THE MOVIES THAT IT TOOK OF NOT. LESS THAN SEVEN YEARS JUST TO GET SOMETHING MOVING ON THE GROUND WITH SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WAS THERE BACK ALL OF THE PROCESS BEING IN THE- OPPORTUNITIES. PULLING A DEBT SEEK CHALLENGE. SALUTE AND HOUSE. YOU HAVE ONE. ARE FOR YOU REGARDING THE DECLINE IN OUR GAS TAX REVENUES AS A RESULT OF CODED NINETEEN. YONDER WIND OUT TO WHEN WE HAD TO KIND OF A SET BACK WITH. THE EARLIER RECESSION. WERE ARE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE A REMOVED FROM CONSIDERATION AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALREADY APPROVED IN NINE AND CAN I AM I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WHEN WE-PRIORITIZE. PROJECTS TO CONTINUE RECEIVE FUNDING OR THAT ARE COMING IN THE QUEUE TO RECEIVE FUNDING HOW WILL YOU APPROACH THAT PRIORITIZATION IT WASN'T RELIEF LEE. HOW TO MY DISTRICT AT THE OUTSET. RIGHT THOSE ARE THINGS OUT TO I KNOW LOOKING OUT WHAT CONDITION MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED FOR THEIR QUALITY AND THE BASINS AND ALL OF THOSE FACTORS THAT GO INTO THAT BUT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME. THEY'RE JUST ON THE QUEUE REDY TO GO AND THEN WE GOT WORD THAT SOME OF THEM WERE GOING TO BE REMOVED AND- THAT WAS TROUBLING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A REAL. CRITERIA THAT PRIOR. SO COULD YOU SHARE SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS OF HOW YOU MIGHT PRO CHOICE OUT OF THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING ON YOUR AGENDA COMING UP. SURE I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK. THAT ARE BATES FOR THAT QUESTION. I THINK. BECAUSE WE ARE FACING. CONSTRAINTS ON FUNDS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE GOING STATE WIDE TO TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THE WORLD HAS CHANGED WITH KOBE NINETEEN. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE POSITIONING PROJECTS AND THE BEST WAYTO LEVERAGE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING OUT LATE AND NEED A MATCH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. BEING THE WISEST STEWARD OF FUNDS AND SO WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PROJECTS AND AS AND LOOK AT HOW WE CAN EXPEDITE OTHER PLANS THAT COULD. POTENTIALLY ADD MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM SUCH AS- EXPANDING. WIDE NETWORK OF EXPRESS LANES AND TOLL LANES BECAUSE THOSE HAVE SUCH PROFOUND BENEFITS. TO MOBILITY BUT ALSO TO TRANSIT THEY HELP MOVE PEOPLE AWAY FROM- THE GOODS WILL BE COURT ORDERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON. ADDRESSING WHERE GAS TAX MAY FALTER POTENTIALLY EVEN WITH OTHER WAYS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PER MILE CHARGE ETCETERA SO THAT. WE DON'T HAVE TO SAY NO THIS PROJECTS THAT PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON BUT TO LOOK AT INSTEAD HOW DO WE INVEST IN THE VERY PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE THESE MULTIPLE NETWORK BENEFITS AND IN. LOOTING THE ENVIRONMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE KEEPING OUR PROMISES WITH THE VOTERS WE'RE KEEPING PROMISES THAT THE LEGISLATURE THAT MADE VERY COURAGEOUS DECISIONS. FOR SB NINE AND BACK PROP SIX. SO I NEED. SENSING SO IN THE NEW HOPE IN NINETEEN. THANK YOU THAT I'M I'M CALM WITH THE YEAR POINT BECAUSE I FEEL THAT YOU HAVE A REAL CLOSE CA. WITH THE DISK HAND IS NEEDED TO AND WE'LL GIVE IT A FAIR SHOT AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WILL BE ABLE TO EMBRACE IT FAR PROJECT COMES UP ON THE CUT LIST OR A LITTLE CUTTING ARE ABOUT I THINK THEY'LL BE AN EXPLANATION THERE AND IF NOT I'LL BE CALLING YOU SO.

HOW DID YOU USE THE NET PROCEEDS TO SUPPORT IMPACTED COMMUNITY SIR ADJACENT COMMUNITIES AND I THINK IT WOULD BE VALUABLE FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO HEAR HOW THAT'S BEEN PUT INTO ACTION NOT JUST THEORETICAL. HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTING IF YOU COULD SHARE SOME OF THAT THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER MINING I REALLY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION TODAY AND UP WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW EXPRESS LANES IN TOLL LANES CAN BE AN EMPOWERMENT TOOL FOR- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT. RIGHT FROM THE OUTSET AND I WAS PLEASE TO SEE THE LEADERSHIP OF. STEPHANIE WIGGINS WHO IS NOW THE CEO METROLINK WHO WHO RAN THIS THIS PROGRAM IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST- ON THE WEST COAST. OF THE PART THAT WE HAD WITH THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WAS THAT HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION OF THE TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION ALL RIGHT INTO THE BUS SYSTEM SO WE NOT ONLY MADE SURE THAT WITH THAT YOU HAD GOOD. BUSES WE HAD. FUNDS TO THE NET TOLL REVENUE AS YOU PASSED GO TO THINGS OR- METRO BIKE SHARE THEY WENT TO LIGHTING AND SAFE STATION ALONG THESE CORRIDORS THAT MEANT. BETTER MOBILITY AND WE MADE SURE THAT THERE WERE THINGS LIKE THE EQUITY PROGRAM FOR THE ON BANKS SO THAT PEOPLE. HATE YOU A TRANSPONDER BUT DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A BANK YOU DON'T THINK IT PAYING PASSED THE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE IT ON A- CREDIT CARD. IN ADDITION I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN A HALLMARK OF WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE NET TOOL PROGRAM AND WHAT I HOPE IS INCLUDED IN FUTURE. EXPRESSED IN PROGRAMS IS THAT WITHIN THAT MY RADIUS. IS TOLL. LAKE EVEY- CONVERSION INTO THE ADA COMPLIANT VEHICLES WE HAD. IN ADDITION AS PART OF THE EXPRESS LANES PEOPLE HAVE NOTED THAT IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXPRESS LANES AS A DRIVER IT WAS THE BASIS OF 40% OF NEW EVEY VEHICLES BEING PURCHASED THAT WAS A UCLA STUDY AND SO IN THAT NOT ONLY DID WE REDUCE TRAFFIC REDUCE IDOLING. WE CAN ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT INTO EVEY TRANSPORTATION SO IN THE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED BY ASTHMA AND OBESITY AND- HIGH PRESSURE AND ALL OF THESE EMERGING ISSUES THAT ARE MAKING PEOPLE EVEN MORE VULNERABLE TO COVERT NINETEEN WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT HOW TO CLEAN THE AIR MOVE PEOPLE BETTER AND GET PEOPLE TO MORE JOBS ALONG THESE CORRIDORS THE NEVER HAD. FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH GEN I THINK. THE ONE THEME THAT CAME OUT OF OUR CONVERSATION WAS THE PUBLIC HEALTH IS INTERCONNECTED WITH HOW WE APPROACH TRANSPORTATION SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT IN A MADAM CHAIR I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT- THE NOMINATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. IF YOU SEND A THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR LEBRETON. YES SENATOR AWFUL YES PLEASE. I'M SURE OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GOOD TO MAY NOT FALL WITHIN YOUR SANDBOX BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU WILL WERE OF IT IS OF. THE RULE MAKING PROCESS GOING TO DEAL WITH VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND TRANSPORTATION WERE IN ESSENCE- NO ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION MILES IN TERMS OF LANES. CAN BE APPROVED AS I UNDERSTAND IT. UNLESS IF IT IF IT INCREASES THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED NOW WHEN YOU LIVE IN WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS YOU KNOW. MOST OF OUR JOBS ARE IN A HIGHLY IN THE URBANIZED COASTAL AREAS LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY. BUT DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF LAND IN THE COST OF LAND AND HOUSING. THE HOUSING DEVELOPS OUT WHERE I COME FROM. SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM WHERE I AM TO THE JOBS UNTIL WE SOMEHOW BALANCE OUT OUR JOBS NO WE HAVE A HOUSING POLICY THAT ENCOURAGES HOUSING IN FACT REQUIRES HOUSING TO BE BUILT WHERE I AM. DEVELOP TATIAN POP DISCOURAGE. THE LAYING OF NEW ROADWAY. TO MOVE PEOPLE WHO MOVE TO THOSE HOUSES. ARE WE HAVE VIRTUALLY NO TRANSIT IN TERMS OF EFFECTIVE BUS. WHERE I AM THE LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY FOR JOBS AND THE RAIL LINES ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE IN TERMS OF TIME AND FREQUENCY. SO I THINK IS A STATE AND AS I SAID I DON'T THINK THIS FALLS WITHIN THE C. D. C.'S PURVIEW. BUT AS A STATE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN OUR HOUSING POLICY. OUR TRANSPORTATION POLICY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THROUGH THE TO GO BECAUSE WE ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO MOVE TO THE COASTAL AREAS. OR EXPAND IN THE COASTAL AREAS. WITHOUT REQUIRING THE COASTAL OR IS TO DEVELOP THE HOUSING SO I THOUGHT IS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION YOU SHOULD AT LEAST BE AWARE OF THE DISCONNECT AND HELP US. IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT. AND TRY TO GET SOME. FOLKS WHO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO FOCUS. ON THOSE ISSUES I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND SORRY TO BRING THAT UP AT THE END BUT WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM THANK YOU ARE SENATOR ROTH AND IN FACT THAT IS A- DISCUSSION THAT WILL CONTINUE- IN THE SENATE BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME A DISCUSSION AS PART OF.
