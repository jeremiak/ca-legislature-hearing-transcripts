MEMBERS OVER. TO BANKING THAT WOULD BE GREAT. AND I SEE MISTER CHOI IS HERE SO WE CAN. WE CAN START AS A SUB COMMITTEE -- AND TILL WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS HERE SINCE WE HAVE. THE AUTHOR HERE -- YEAH HE WAS. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG NAY. YOU WILL BE PRESENTING SPF. FIFTY ONE PLEASE FEEL FREE PROCEED. LOST MY THIRTY TWO MILLION LISTENERS OKAY WE GOT A SEARCH MILLION [inaudible] OKAY THE TOGETHER WITH THE TREASURE OF THE CITY CALIFORNIA FIONA MAW I AGAIN PRESENT THIS MEASURE THAT WE PRESENTED LAST YEAR. THE VOTERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR BY A VOTE OF 57% TO LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. THAT CREATED A MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE WHICH INFORMED BY A TENSION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT MARIJUANA IS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG. AND AS SUCH YOU COULD NOT USE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THAT DRUG AND DEPOSITED INTO BANKS. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE ON THE ONE HAND AND MANAGE THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE VOTERS. DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES THAT INFORM THIS ISSUE DEAL WITH THE THE ACCOUNTING ISSUES AND DEAL WITH THE TAX COLLECTION ISSUES OF AN INDUSTRY. THAT'S ANYWHERE EXPECTED WIEN FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND REQUIRED TELLS ME THAT HE THINKS THERE'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS BURIED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HIS DISTRICT A FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN A TRACTOR TRAILER. IT IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE SEEN STORIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WHERE THERE HAS BEEN THE HORRIBLE -- BOB BERRY IS DEATHS AND ALL KINDS OF HORRIBLE THINGS. AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE DO HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALLOWS US TO BANK THIS MONEY WHAT WE DO. AND SO ARE HONESTLY THIS IS NOT A THAT WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE WITH THE COMMITTEE WAS IT NEAR THE SENATE THAT THE REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT FINANCES CALLED IN THE SENATE. AND ON THIS ISSUE CAME BEFORE ME WITH A NUMBER OF MEMBERS. AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAD EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA THE LAW MANY YEARS AGO MY THOUGHT WAS TO COME UP WITH A LIMITED CHARTER BANK WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. WE HAVE THIS KIND OF INTERREGNUM WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE PROCESS BUT WE DON'T WANT TO COME TO DO SOMETHING AND THAT SOMETHING BRAND NEW. SO THE IDEA WAS TO BOLT ON A LIMITED CHARTER BANK AND ON CREDIT UNION INTO THE BANKING SYSTEM UNDER THE BANKING COMMISSIONER WE CHANGE THE NAME TO THERE ARE NO IT'S CALLED BUT I STILL CALL. THE BANKING COMMISSIONER AND SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT WE DO AND WE CREATED THIS BANK WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE'S NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BRANCHES AROUND CALIFORNIA THE BEEN CLOSED SO WE COULD LITERALLY IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE ALL THESE SAFES ALL OVER THE PLACE TO PUT. MONEY IN THE BANKS. OR CREDIT UNIONS THE CASE MAY BE. AND WE CAME UP WITH FOR PURPOSES THAT WE WOULD LIMIT THIS TO PURPOSE NUMBER ONE IS TO PAY TAXES FEES LOCAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE LIKE WHERE YOU COULD USE A CHECK. FROM THE LIMITED CHARTER BANK THE CHECK WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS. AND IT WOULD JUST BASICALLY SAY THIS CHECK IS ISSUED BY S. P. FIFTY ONE CANNABIS BANK IN THE ONLY DEPOSIT CASH IN THE LIMITED CHARTER BANK. YOU COULDN'T DEPOSITS INTO ANOTHER FEDERAL BANKER STATE BANK THE ONLY COULD DEPOSITED INTO YOUR BANK OR TO ANOTHER BANK WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT. WELL IF YOU'RE GONNA GO PAY YOUR RENT IF YOU CAN GO PAID MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT WHAT WE SEE IS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS MANY OF THEM. WHERE WERE PAYING FOR HIGHER PATROL TO ACTUALLY -- ESCORT THE MONEY WE'RE PAYING FOR BULLET PROOF GLASS I TALKED TO ET DE ID NUMBER THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE CASH AND AND TO MANAGE TO COUNT ALL THE KINDS OF CASH SOMETIMES A MILLION DOLLARS A DAY THAT COMES INTO A GOVERNMENT OFFICE. WELL THE SAID YOU GET A MUCH OF CHECKS NOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE THESE CHECKS AND GO. CATCH THEM AT THE AT THE CHARTER BANK OR CREDIT STONE ACCOUNT IF THEY WILL BUT IT'S A CONVENIENCE CASH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IF YOU WILL. SO WE SAID WHAT ARE THE FOUR THINGS THAT WE COULD DO THAT KIND OF LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT'S NOT TOO COMPLICATED ONE ALL YOUR GOVERNMENT FEES. WITHIN THE OPTION OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO YOUR RENT. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU HAVE A LANDLORD WHO IS TEN FOLKS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE RENTING TO WHY THEY HAVE TO COME IN WITH BIG PILES OF CASH EVERY MONTH THAT GET A CHECK. AND DELIVER THREE YOUR VENDORS EUROPE EUROPE PLUMBER AND RATHER HAVING GIVE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED BUCKS TO A PLUMBER -- IN CASH YOU CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER CHECK AND PAY THE BILLS AND LASTLY TO INVEST THE MONEY. A AT THE STATE TREASURY WHERE IT'S WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN ESSENCE JUST TO KIND OF CUT TO THE CHASE OF HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS IT'S WE COULD CALL THE BANK. AND THE IDEA IS THAT ULTIMATELY. WENT WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONFORMS AND THEY WILL AT SOME POINTS BECAUSE OTHER STATES HAVE SIMILAR KINDS OF ISSUES WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONFORMS. YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THESE INSTITUTIONS AND ROLL THEM INTO EXISTING BANKS THE THE BIG BANKS WE'VE SEEN THIS WITH COMMITTEE BANKS ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO IT BECOMES EASY BECAUSE THE ALL OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF BANKING WILL APPLY WE DON'T WANT TO REINVENT A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR THIS. SO THAT MEANS THAT THE PRODUCE YOUR OBLIGATIONS THE ROLE OF DIRECTORS THE AUDIT PROVISIONS ALL OF THE THINGS THAT INFORM WHAT BANKING. N. N. N. H. N. DOUG WITH THE COLUMN -- CREDIT UNIONS ARE. BASICALLY BAY FALL WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK AND ANSWER THE LAST QUESTION IS WHAT HOUSES ALL PAID FOR WHAT REALLY HAPPENS OHIO HAS DONE THIS TO SOME EXTENT. DID YOU KNOW BANK WHAT IS BANKING BANKING IS I TAKE YOUR DEPOSIT I GIVE YOU THIS MUCH INTEREST I CAN I TAKE YOUR MONEY I LANDED TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND I MAKE THE BIG. RIGHT I PAY MY EXPENSES MY MAKE A PROFIT ON INTEREST WITH NO INTEREST BECAUSE NO LOANS IN THIS BANK IT'S NOT GONNA BE NORMAL BANK. IT'S LITERALLY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AND THE WAY IT'S GOING TO WORK AS YOU CAN CHARGE FEES. AND SO MY QUESTION TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH KEEP AN ACCOUNT AND MY QUESTION HOW DOES A CHECK BUT IT'S A LOT LESS MONEY IN SECURITY ALL THE OTHER RISKS AND STUFF ASSOCIATED. THE FINAL POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IN BANKING IS IS INSURANCE NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE THE MONEY GIVE IT TO A BANK AND THEN THE BANK IT'S ROBIN YOU LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY OR SEIZED OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IS NORMALLY THE ENTITY. THAT INSURERS I'VE MET WITH A NUMBER OF IT PRIVATE IN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT FOR A FEE. THEY WILL PROVIDE THE INSURANCE A TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER COUNT ON LIKE THAT FEDERAL DEPOSIT CHURCH CORPORATIONS TO EARN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PER. CUSTOMER I HAVE TEN ACCOUNTS A GET TWO POINT FIVE MILLION OF INSURANCE SO WE WE IF COME UP WITH A PRETTY ELEGANT APPROACH. EIGHTY FOUR VOTES THROUGH BOTH HOUSES LAST TIME ONLY ELEVEN THOSE BIPARTISAN AND BASICALLY WENT TO THE SYSTEM. AND AND IN ESSENCE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE FORMER. BANKING COMMISSIONER SAID WE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH AT THE END OF THE TERM SO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CALLED THE CHAIR OF APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I'M INFORMED I COULD BE WRONG BUT I THINK I'M PROUD PRETTY RIGHT. AND SAID HOLD THIS BILL THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED THIS IS AN URGENCY BILL IT'S GONE THRUGH -- THE OTHER HOUSE I THINK ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY. AND THE IDEA IS TO COME UP WITH AN APPROACH IS A PERFECT I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU KNOW THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS THING IS WE GOT A PROBLEM. AND WE'VE GOT IT GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF IT MEANS WE AT AMENDED LATER AND FIX STUFF LATER WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. BUT HOW CAN WE SIT BACK AND LEAVE ALL THIS CASH THAT NOW THEY'RE IN THE SYSTEM AND NOT PROVIDE A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH I THINK THIS IS PRETTY SMART PROCHE ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. OFF THE TREASURER'S OFFICE THANK YOU AND I WILL DO A QUICK INTERMISSION JUST BECAUSE WE DO HAVE QUORUM RIGHT NOW SO I WANNA OFFICIALLY START THE HEARING. AND WE WILL START WITH A IF WE CAN JUST DO THE ROLL CALL PLEASE THANK [inaudible] LEÃ³N [inaudible] CHEN [inaudible] ERA CAN [inaudible] BURKE [inaudible] CERVANTES [inaudible] CHOI [inaudible] APRIL [inaudible] GRAYSON [inaudible] MELENDEZ [inaudible] STONE. WEBER. WICKS HERE. THANK YOU AND I DO WANT TO MAKE IT QUICK AND NOW ANNOUNCEMENT ITEM NUMBER FOUR IN OUR AGENDA SB FIVE FORTY JONES HAS BEEN RESET FOR OUR NEXT HEARING ON JULY EIGHTH. AT THE REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR. SO WITH THAT WE WILL GO BACK TO THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL SURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS CASEY O'CONNOR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR STATE TREASURER FEE ON A MOCK. AS ALTHOUGH ALSO WITH AS MUCH OF DIRECTOR WHEN WE'RE AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND DURING HER TENURE ON THE BOARD WE WERE THE AGENCY THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTING SALES AND USE TAX PAYMENTS IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY SIX UP UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN CD TFA TOOK THAT OVER AS ONE THEIR AND ACCORD TO THE ALEJO'S OFFICE AFTER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS LESS IN TAX REVENUE THAN WAS FORECASTED. AND THIS IS DUE IN PART TO SNIFF AGAIN TAX BURDEN COUPLED WITH THE LACK OF ACCESS TO SAFE RESPONSIBLE BANKING UNLIKE MOST BUSINESS AS AS A SENATOR TOUCHED ON CANNABIS BUSINESSES ARRIVE TO GOVERNMENT. CANNABIS BINS AS ARRIVE TO THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES WITH DUFFEL BAG FULL OF CASH AS THEY DID ARE BE A WE OFFICE THEY WOULD SHOW UP WITH THEIR TAX REVENUE IN DUFFEL BAG SOME OF THEM WOULD DRIVE THROUGH UNDER FIFTY MILES BECAUSE THERE BE A WE OFFICES. WOULD NOT TAKE IT IN CERTAIN AREAS OF CALIFORNIA THE BE ARRIVING TO OUR OFFICES WITH THEIR BAGS WE COUNT IT THERE CLOSE UP SHOP HAVE TO CALL THE BANK LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE COMING WITH THIS REVENUE. TELL YOU WHAT -- THE HIGHER THE ARMY CORPS YOUR SERVICES THEY WOULD DRIVE IT FROM OUR OFFICE TO THE BANK OF AMERICA BANKAMERICARD CLOSE FOR ABOUT TEN HOURS -- BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF CASHWOULD HAVE WE GOT WHEN WE CAN AGAIN WITH THEM IT'S NOT A VERY RESPONSIBLE ARE SAFE WAY. TO HANDLE IT AND ALSO FOR AUDITING PURPOSES THE BOARD WOULD -- WE HAVE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION PEOPLE STAY OUTSIDE DISPENSARIES FOR ABOUT SIX DAYS THREE HOURS A DAY DIFFERENT IS THE MONTH THEY WOULD COUNT HOW MANY PEOPLE GO INTO THAT DISPENSARY. THEY WOULD PUT A BASE -- A NUMBER ON ABOUT EIGHTY DOLLARS WITH THE AVERAGE. A PAYMENT THERE THEY WITHIN EXTRAPOLATE BACK AND TRY TO GUESS WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE RECEIVING AN TAXES. IT PROVED TO BE A BARRIER PROVED TO BE AN OFFICIAL AND APPROVED TO NOT BE VERY ACCURATE SO THE CHARGERS BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FINDING A VIABLE WAY TO BANK THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY FOR YEARS NOW. SB FIFTY ONE OF THEM PARTNERING WITH THE CENTER HERTZBERG SINCE THE BEGINNING WE SEE THIS AS A NECESSARY REAL SOLUTION TO GETTING CASH OFF THE STREETS. HI IN PUBLIC SAFETY INCREASE TAX COLLECTION AND TRANSPARENT AUDITING OF THE MONEY FROM CANNABIS TO INCENTIVIZE COMPLIANCE. WE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WE APPRECIATE THAT COMMITTEE SUPPORT LAST YEAR AND I WANT TO GIVE ME CHEN CAN SOMETIME AS WELL. THANK YOU CASEY THANK YOU SENATOR MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO -- VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL FOR THE SECOND TIME IN ONE I THINK THE SENATOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP -- AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AND I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE REAL WORLD EXAMPLES AND WE WE HAVE HAD UNAVOIDABLE PUBLIC SAFETY AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ISSUES OUR MEMBERS AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATION -- TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE ONE MEMBER COMPANY THAT IS FORCED TO TRANSPORT AS MUCH AS A MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S JUST ONE COMPANY. IN A MONTH IN CASH TO SEE THE TFA IS REGIONAL OFFICE TO PREPARE FOR PAYMENT THIS COMPANY HAS FOR STAFF MEMBERS FULL TIME THAT DO NOTHING BUT COUNT CASH. WHICH IS THEN TRANSPORTED BY AN ARMED GUARD COMPANY IN TOTAL THIS PARTICULAR CANNABIS OPERATOR SPENDS -- MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR SIMPLY SECURING AN COUNTING CASH NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF PURCHASING CASHIER'S CHECKS TO PAY RENT AND OTHER BUSINESS SERVICES INCLUDING TO PAY THE I. MEMBER% ASSOCIATION DUES. SO AND AND AND AS I SAID THESE ISSUES DO NOT SIMPLY A FACT THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY THAT TOUCH THE PLANT BUT ALSO ANCILLARY ENTITIES -- CCA ITSELF HAS -- HAD ITS BANK ACCOUNTS SHUT DOWN SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE NAME CANNABIS IN OUR ASSOCIATION TITLE OUR PACKET COUNT HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN NUMEROUS TIMES. WE SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS TRYING TO FIND NEW CREDIT UNIONS OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO BANK OUR INDUSTRY -- AND WE HAVE A FULL TIME STAFF PERSON THAT IS SIMPLY DEDICATED TO CONTACTING MEMBERS EACH MONTH BECAUSE THEY TOO ARE GOING THROUGH BANK ACCOUNTS ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS OR JUST SIMPLY -- WE HAVE TO JUST ARRANGE TO TO GET THE CASH SO THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED WE HAVE BEEN -- PARTNERS AND WORKING WITH THAT THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE WE TESTIFIED AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- BUT REALLY BELIEVE THIS BILL IS -- A SENSIBLE SOLUTION WHILE THE FEDS -- DELIBERATE AND HOPEFULLY CHANGE THEIR POLICY GOING FORWARD WHICH IS WHY WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT PLEASE TO STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR POSITION CHAIR MEMBERS ROSSBACH THEM GOT TO SEE IF SACRAMENTO IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BRANDS TO GRAB HOP UP LA COUNTY DEPART ACT. BOARD OF SUPERVISORS STRONG SUPPORTER THANK YOU. IN AFGHAN BLAST SHEPHERD ON BEHALF OF THE CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE'LL BILL. OKAY. SO NOTICES OPPOSITION WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND [inaudible] MEMBERS [inaudible] ANSWER QUESTIONS. MR CHOI. SENATOR. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW WHAT THOSE STAYS -- THAT HAVE LEGALIZED SO YOU CAN WAS BUSINESS ON A COLORADO OREGON HOW ARE THEY HANDLING I HAVEN'T DONE ANY RESEARCH ALSO. WHAT THANK YOU SIR IS A QUESTION I HAVE I'VE TALKED TO A HIGH OF TOOK TO WASHINGTON OF TALK TO COLORADO IF TALKED A NUMBER OF THE STATE'S EXPERTS? FOLKS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND YOU KNOW PART OF WHICH IS TO HIT MISS WITH AS WAS INDICATED TRYING TO OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COLORADO RELATING -- TO WHICH MCCALL IT -- TO BANKING DEAL THERE A HIGH -- HAS A CHARGING BANKS BUT IT'S REALLY HIT AND MISS IT'S REALLY BEEN HARD WASHINGTON'S REALLY BEEN. A JOURNALIST STRUGGLING WITH IT AND AND AND QUITE FRANKLY THEY'VE ALL CALLED US AND LOOKING AT THIS HIGH TIER BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. I MEAN BASICALLY YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS A PRIVATE BANK NOT A PUBLIC BANK SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS INVESTORS ARE GOING TO COME ALONG. JUST LIKE YOU DO WHEN YOU FORM A BANK AND THEY'RE GONNA PUT UP TEN MILLION DOLLARS OR WHATEVER THEY'RE GONNA PUT UP IN CAPITAL THEY GET TO INVEST THE MONEY THEY'RE GONNA RENTED A BANK BRANCH. AND THEY'RE GONNA OWN A BANK AND THEY'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY MAKE MONEY ON IT AND I THINK PROBABLY WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS A YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THE INDUSTRY OF COME AND TALK TO US BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BANK TO BE ABLE TO JUST LIKE REAL ESTATE. DEVELOPERS DO TO GET A BANK TO HELP THEM IN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AND THEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS ONCE IT BECOMES LEGALIZED AS I INDICATED MY OPENING. THE THE LARGER BANKS ARE GOING TO COME IN AND AND AND ROLL THEM UP AND THEY'RE GONNA MAKE BIG PROFITS CAUSING OLYMPIC AGAIN A FIVE ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN DEPOSITS OR WHATEVER IT IS AND THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO BANK WITH THOSE FOLKS. ANDTHEY'LL BUILD RELATIONSHIPS SO THE IDEA IS IT'S FORMED AROUND REALLY QUITE FRANKLY IT WAS MY ADVERSE REACTION TO THE PUBLIC BANK IDEA BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IN TEN YEARS. AND THE IDEA WAS WE HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY HERE TO GET THIS UP AND RUNNING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ACCOUNTING FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I WOULD SUSPECT. THAT GOVERNMENT IS NOT RECEIVING AS MUCH MONEY AS IT SHOULD BECAUSE THE HASSLE OF JUST DEALING WITH THE CASH VERSUS WRITING A CHECK TO PAY THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE ESTIMATES IN MY JUDGMENT IS LOWER THAN IT SHOULD BE. I REALIZE THAT THAT THIS ISSUE YOUR INTERIM MEASURE THAT'S RIGHT I A WONDER AT THE WRIST -- AND THE MOVEMENT. TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC BANKING AND IN THAT THE BANKING COMMITTEE. I ASKED THAT QUESTION WHETHER THE DO REAL HIDDEN MOTIVATION OF THAT THE IDEA WAS SET TO ACCOMMODATE THIS -- CANNABIS -- INDUSTRY -- MONEY AND EVERYBODY IN THE AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE. IT. IF THAT IDEA PUBLIC BANKING COURSED THROUGH. THEN NOW -- WILL THE PUBLIC BANKING -- LUCKY CITIES AND COUNTIES OR WHATEVER AND LOCAL UNITS -- SET UP -- UP OUR ARE THEY AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF TIME NEEDED TO TAKE THAT THIS KIND OF A CAN IT WAS -- WELL WE'VE LOOKED AT AND THAT WAS A NUMBER OF LAWYERS ON THE SITUATION IN. THE PROBLEM WHETHER IT'S A STATE INSTITUTION OR A PRIVATE INSTITUTION THE NOTION OF WORKING TO THE FEDERAL CLEARING HOUSES. AND THE NOTION OF HAVING FDIC INSURANCE ALL INFORMS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID. BASICALLY THE NOTIONS HERE'S WHAT'S CALLED A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM SO THAT YOU ONLY CAN DEPOSIT MONEY OR TAKE MONEY OUT OF YOUR BANK BRANCH NOW LET'S ASSUME THERE'S IT IN IT IS -- TEN COMPANIES TO COME ALONG AND FORM BANKS THEY COULD FORM IN IRAQ INNER BANKING AGREEMENTS AMONG THEM SO I COULD GO IN CASH MY CANNABIS BANK SAY IN IN IN ANOTHER IN ANOTHER COUNTY IF THEY HAD ONE AND THEY COULD HAVE AGREEMENTS AMONG THEMSELVES. BUT THE KEY FRAMEWORK IS IT HAS TO OPERATE ONLY WITHIN THE STATE. WE CANNOT USE FEDERAL INSURANCE AND I CAN'T USE THE FEDERAL CLEARING HOUSE IT HAS TO BE WITH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WITHIN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS SO THAT WOULD I WOULD NOT THINK. THAT A PUBLIC BANK COULD COULD REALLY DO CANNABIS THE PUBLIC BANKING IS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO REDUCE COSTS AND AFFORDING WHETHER IT'S STUDENT LOANS OR LOW INCOME HOUSING OR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IS REALLY THE THE IMPETUS OF THE PUBLIC BANKING SYSTEM AS FAR AS I CAN DETECT. THANK. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT CNN SENATOR HERTZBERG CAN YOU COMMENT JUST A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT YOU FEEL SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT CONCERNS HAVE BEEN AND HOW. THEY COULD OR COULD NOT BE ADDRESSED YES IT'S HARD OKAY THIS IS HARD I MEAN I DON'T OKAY I'M NOT. THIS IS HARD IT IS WHAT IT IS AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW REGULATORS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE IN WHATEVER AND I'M PUSHING THEM. AND BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A REAL PUBLIC INTEREST HERE AND AND THAT YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF MEETINGS WITH THAT WITH WITH THE COMMISSIONER OWNS WAS FANTASTIC OF OUR FOREVER AND ALL THE RICH IT PRE PREVIOUS JOBS IN THE LIKE. BUT I THINK THEY WERE JUST FEARFUL OF A HARD IT WAS GOING TO BE A MET WITH THE NEW COMMISSIONER WHOSE FANTASTIC. AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE WORRIED AND I TOLD WILL HELP THEM BUT BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THESE CHALLENGES IN PUBLIC LIFE WHERE YOU'VE GOT THIS UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT PROBLEM WITH ALL THIS CASH THAT'S THAT IMPACTS SO MANY ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE LIFE. AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND SOMEHOW WE JUST GOT TO GO FOR IT AND THE BAND AND WILL HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT ISN'T IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS IT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH THERE IS NO QUESTION. THEIR WORD ABOUT THE REGULATIONS THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND AND AND AND AND AND AND THE LIKE I DON'T BLAME THEM BUT BUT YOU KNOW THERE SOMETIMES WHERE ARE YOU GONNA DO YOU GONNA JUST TAKE ACTION AND WE'RE IN THIS HORRIBLE POSITION IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S WHAT INFORMS MY DECISION TO CARRY THIS LEGISLATION WITH THE US THEY TREASURE AND FORMERLY THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THANK YOU I KNOW IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND AS YOU SAID I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT THE REAL WORLD EVERY DAY A LIFE IS -- FOR A LOT OF THE FOLKS ON INTERSTATE IN TERMS OF CASH AND SO IT WE ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD. TO SOME KIND OF SOLUTION AND THAT SOLUTION NOT SUPER CLEAR BUT A THINK OUR STATE IS A VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THIS THANK YOU SAID ONE THING MANAGER. IS LOCAL WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS THING IN A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COME OF ALL THIS COCKAMAMIE IDEAS AND CREDIT CARDS AND THIS AND THAT DO THIS STUFF. WE WOULD TALK A TREASURE'S OFFICE TOOK AN EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE VIEW ABOUT WHAT THIS OPENING ACT LOOKS LIKE WE KNOW THAT IF THERE'S A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE CANNABIS BECOMES RECOGNIZED IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SURE THIS BANKING MODEL. RIGHT BUT WE STARTED WITH THE SUPER SIMPLE WE YOU KNOW BRANCH SUPER BASIC THINGS WHICH WORKS WITHIN A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM MORE MONEY TRANSFERS WITHIN THAT WORLD. AND THEN THE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY AND THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES IN THIS IS NO QUESTION WE SOUGHT. TO IF SOMEONE HAS A BUNCH OF MONEY WHATEVER ECONOMY DOLLARS IN THE BANK I CAN'T TUNING WITH IT WELL I CAN GIVE IT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND GET INTEREST ON IT. AND THE STATE GET SOME MONEY FOR A BOND OR A MUNICIPAL ENTITY CAUSES WITHIN THE STATE YES SIR CHALLENGES NO QUESTION. BUT THAT WAS THE THINKING SUPER CONSERVATIVE LIMITED APPROACH. ALL THESE OTHER FOLKS WITH ALL THESE OTHER ELECTRONIC IDEAS AND CREDIT CARD SYSTEMS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF WE LIMITED IT. AND AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR AN OPENING -- ON THIS CUT SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS THIS. THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I THINK THAT WAS IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT SO WITH THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND VOTE.
