UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE FACING A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA OF PREDATORY TOWING COMPANIES IMPOUNDING THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES AND HOLDING THEM ILLEGALLY WITHOUT FOLLOWING STATUTORY PROTOCOL. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THE TOWING COMPANIES MUST FOLLOW THE REQUIREMENTS OF CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE SECTION TWO TWO SIX FIVE EIGHT IN ORDER TO TELL MICHAEL MOBILITY VEHICLES FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY. IN OUR EXPERIENCE PREDATORY TOWING COMPANIES WILL POINT TO THE CALIFORNIA TELLING STATUTE AS JUSTIFICATION FOR REMOVING OUR VEHICLES FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY WHILE ALSO ARGUING THAT BECAUSE THE MICROBIOLOGY DEVICES NOT COUNTED THE VEHICLE UNDER THE SAME STATUTE. THE TOWING COMPANIES DO NOT NEED TO FOLLOW ITS PROTOCOL AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY FOUR WOULD RESOLVE THIS LEGAL GRAY AREA. I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THE SYSTEMS THE LONGHORN POUNDING MAKE MOBILITY DEVICES FROM PUBLIC SPACE WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED WITH AND BY OUR CITY PARTNERS. ARE NOT AT ISSUE HERE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT UNDER AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY FOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO TELL MY FOR MOBILITY DEVICES.

DURING THAT WAR THE REPUBLIC OF CREE DISPATCH THE SECOND LARGEST NUMBER OF COMBAT TROOPS AFTER UNITED STATES AS AN ALLY OF THE U. S. AND MAN MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO HELP THE MILITARY.

OPERATOR DO YOU HAVE SCOTT HOLE OR DON HARPER. YES PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SCOTT HALL WELL I AM THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY TWO FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS THE LETTER DESIGNATION OF A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE IS THE RESULT OF MULTIPLE YEARS OF GROUNDWORK EDUCATION LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY OUR ORGANIZATION CA CDSL AND SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA'S ACTIVE VETERAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURPOSE FOR THE DESIGNATION OF THE DRIVER'S LICENSE IS TO INCENTIVIZE VETERANS TO COME AND VISIT THEIR LOCAL CVS SO TO BE SCREENED FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL VETERANS BENEFITS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE- DESPITE PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS WITH CYSTIC CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS IN RECEIVING OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IF YOU FEDERAL BENEFITS PAID DIRECTLY TO THE VETERAN ULTIMATELY BEING IN HOUSTON THE STATE'S ECONOMY. FEDERAL VA BENEFITS CAN BE QUITE GENEROUS HOWEVER THE VERY COMPLICATED TO APPLY FOR. A BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE APPLICATIONS AND ALSO BECAUSE OF VETERANS CIRCUMSTANCES BEING DIFFERENT I TEACH VETERANS OUTREACH TO VETERANS IS EXPENSIVE AND IS LABOR INTENSIVE HITS A VALUE OF HAVING A POPULAR BENEFIT LIKE TO THAT OUR DESIGNATION OF THE DRIVER'S LICENSE. WHICH DRIVES VETERANS TO OUR OFFICES FOR DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY TWO WOULD GREATLY MODEL THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM BY INTRODUCING DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS. OF VETERANS OF THE DRIVER'S LICENSE PROGRAM. NUMBER TO STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES WHO OFFER BENEFITS FOR QUALIFIED US VETERANS DEPEND ON THE VETERAN DESIGNATION TO DETERMINE QUALIFICATION. THIS BILL WOULD DIMINISH THE UTILITY OF THAT DESIGNATION AND LEAD TO A CONFUSION AND HESITANCY TO USE IT. THREE EIGHTY TWENTY NINE FIFTY TWO IT ALSO CONSIDERS THE PUBLIC VETR DESIGNATION ON THE DRIVER'S LICENSE ALLOWS VETERANS WHO SERVED IN THIS NATION'S MILITARY. AWAITED PROBABLY INDICATE THEIR SERVICE ALSO MANY BUSINESSES EXTEND DISCOUNTS TO VETERANS. AND ADDING ANOTHER CLASSIFICATION OF VETERAN WOULD CONFUSE BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYEES AND MAY EVEN RESULT IN THE CURTAILMENT OF SOME OF THESE DISCOUNTS. IT FOR DURING OUR MULTI YEAR EFFORT- TO GIVE VETERAN PLACED ON THE DRIVER'S LICENSE WE FACED RECURRING HURDLES- FROM CONCERNS- WITH CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL REGARDING THE INCLUSION OF TOO MUCH INFORMATION ON A LICENSE. DMV HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF ROOM ON THE LICENSE TO FIT THE DESIGNATION. AND ALSO THE REAL ID ACT HAS ITS OWN LIMITATIONS ON WHAT COULD BE ON A LICENSE- WE HAD ISSUES GETTING SEVEN LETTERS INSERTED ON THE LICENSE I'M NOT SURE. HUDDLED DMV WOULD AGREE TO PUTTING TWENTY TWO CHARACTERS ON TO A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND SO IN CLOSING. VETERANS OF ALLIED MILITARIES THAT ASSISTED OUR NATION AND ALL OF OUR NATION'S ONES ARE INDEED I NEED YOU TO A PRIVATE. READY. TO AND THIS TEAM I AM SAID UP THEIR YOU MA'AM. HOW THE FACT REMAINS ARE NOT YOU S. MILLER JET IN THE- PROPOSED BY EIGHTY TWO NINETY SIX TWO DOES NOT PICK WAY TO RECOGNIZE THEM THE SATURDAY. OKAY LICENSE I CARD WITH OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OF.

ANY OTHER VETERANS FOUND IN TERMS TO THE LICENSE WILL CONFUSE THE PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES THAT USE THAT DESIGNATION TO CONFER. BENEFITS TO VETERANS. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY TO SPEAK TO HAVE THEM BE A CALVET WORK TOGETHER TO ESTABLISH A ELIGIBILITY OF NON US VETERAN APPLICANTS FOR THE PROPOSED DESIGNATION. THIS WILL NOT WORK EITHER DEAR BE NO CALIPHATE HAVE THE LANGUAGE SKILLED MANPOWER OR KNOWLEDGE. OKAY MORE MILITARY. IF YOU'RE NOT BETTER MYSELF ONE FIVE ONE START THEIR DEGREE VETERANS THE CREAMERY VS SO I HAVE TOTALLY. BEFORE THE GREAT READ IT THAT THEY GET WHEN THEY SURE TO GET HOWEVER IF NOTHING TO READ YOU CUT TO. VETERANS DOES ON THE LINE FIRST AND FOREMOST A TOOL TO CONNECT US BETTER TO THEIR FEDERAL BENEFITS BY ADDING NON BUREAUCRATIC VIETNAM BETTER LANGUAGE TO THE DRIVER'S LICENSE WOULD BE CONFUSING FOR ALL. PARTIES HE DID AGAIN VETERAN DESIGNATE ON THE DRUGGIST IS REALLY AND REGION TOOL. TO ASSIST US VERY ONLY GOOD PAINTER BETTER. THERE ARE NO BA OR OR BETTER OF ARMY HOW DOES HELP THEM.

ON THE ABILITY OF. THE DMV TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AND ALSO TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T DIMINISH- ARE VETERANS YOU KNOW I NOTE THAT THE STATE OF GEORGIA ALASKA CONNECTICUT HAVE ALREADY FIGURED OUT. HOW TO DO THIS- AND THOSE ARE STATES WITH VERY STRONG TRADITIONS OF HONORING OUR UNITED STATES MILITARY VETERANS YOU KNOW I HAVE TO- YOU KNOW HESITATE TO THINK THAT GEORGE R. ALASKA CONNECTICUT WOUD HAVE DONE ANYTHING THAT WOULD DIMINISH. THE ABILITY OF U. U. S. VETERANS TO ACCESS BENEFITS SO WE WILL FIND A WAY TO THREAD THE NEEDLE.

CITIZENS ARE DEFINITELY DESERVING OF RECOGNITION. THEY'RE NOT SEEKING BENEFITS THEY'RE NOT SEEKING MONEY THEY SIMPLY WANT RECOGNITION OF. THE RISKS AND THE COULD THEN THE SACRIFICES THAT THEY MADE AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT SO COMMITTED TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT- AND WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL TAKE THE BILL UP ON WE HAVE MORE MEMBERS PRESENT THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE NOW TO MR HOLDEN. FOUR AB. TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY THREE. YOU MAY PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- TODAY I AM PRESENTING AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY THREE. THE BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE PEACE OFFICERS MAKING A TRAFFIC OR PEDESTRIAN STOP THE STATE THE REASON FOR QUESTIONS UNLESS THE OFFICE THE REASON WE BELIEVES THAT WITHHOLDING THE REASON FOR THE STOP IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT LIFE. PROP OR PROPERTY FROM IMMINENT HARM. MEMBERS FOR NEARLY A YEAR MY OFFICES WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT POST VARIOUS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS LEGISLATION SURROUNDING TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIAN STOPS. OVER THE PAST YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS ENDEAVOR PORTS SURROUNDING TRAFFIC STOPS TO INCLUDE IN INCLUDE INVESTIGATIONS FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES IN LA TIMES IN A REPORT FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE. THE COMMON THEME SURROUNDING THESE REPORTS IS THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR. PEOPLE OF COLOR MORE SO FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE STOPPED THAN WHITE INDIVIDUALS. WHAT IS MORE TROUBLING IS THAT ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE STOPS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE THREE TIMES. MORE LIKELY TO INVOLVE A WEAPON THEN STOPS OF WHITE INDIVIDUALS. WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. AND POST AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY THREE REQUIRES A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO DOCUMENT THE REASON FOR THE STOP ON CITATION- POLICE REPORT RESULTING FROM THE STOP. IN TERMS OF EDUCATING THE PUBLIC THIS BILL REQUIRES THE DMV TO INCLUDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DUTY OF A POLICE OFFICER TO STATE THE REASON. FOR THE STOP IN THE DMV HANDBOOK AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY. AS YOU MAY RECALL THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AND GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED MY BILL AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH NOW REQUIRES A DMV. TO INCLUDE INFORMATION REGARDING A PERSON CIVIL RIGHTS. DURING A STOP. INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST A PEACE OFFICER. FINALLY THIS BILL MAKES FAILURE TO STATE THE REASON FOR THE STOP GROUNDS FOR A STATUTORY MOTION TO SUPPRESS SUPPRESS. I'M AWARE THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION OF THE BILL IS CAUSING HEARTBURN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PLEDGE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND AN ALTERNATIVE WAY. THE WHOLE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR FAILURE TO DISCLOSE THE REASON OF THE STOP. IN CLOSING MEMBERS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT THE PUBLIC BEGINS BECAUSE PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE BEING ASKED TO SURRENDER THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS AND DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY WERE BEING STOPPED. BUT THEY ARE FORCED TO COMPLY. SURELY THIS BODY CAN FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS DILEMMA. THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I MIGHT ADD ALSO AS I AS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THAT WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE FULLNESS OF THE BILL. BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS FOCUSED ON THAT PART THE DEALS WITH THE DMV. ARE UPDATING UNDER THE REASON FOR THE STOP- BUT WE'VE HAVE IT PERFECTLY VETTED IN PUBLIC SAFETY ON THE OTHER ISSUES AND AS I'VE- INDICATED WILL PREPARE TO. CONTINUE TO WORK TO FIND A- REASONABLE SOLUTION TO. OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT. TO ADDRESS AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU HAVE A WITNESS HERE IN PERSON I DO. LET'S SEE SO IN A PRIOR. HE'S ON THE PHONE LINE OKAY FINANCES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA HAWAII STATE CONFERENCE OF THE END OF LAST WEEK OKAY THANK YOU. I'M OPERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE FIND MISS PRIOR FOR US.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT RICK CALENDAR AND THE CALIFORNIA HAWAII STATE CONFERENCE OF THE NAACP REPRESENTING FIFTY SEVEN BRANCHES IN TWENTY THREE MINUTES STATEWIDE I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A PEACE OFFICER TO STATE THE REASON FOR IN STOCK UNLESS THE OFFICER REASONABLY BELIEVES. THAT WITHHOLDING THE INFORMATION FOR THE STOP AS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE LIFE OR PROPERTY FROM A MINUTE THREATS- CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT'S OPERATIONALLY DISPROPORTIONATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE STOPPED. SEARCH AND SEARCH AS WHITE CALIFORNIANS AT THE RATE OF ABOUT 20% 38% OF ALL STOPS. I'M MORE OFTEN THAN NOT BE STOPPED THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND BEGIN WHEN PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE NOT AFFORDED THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING WHY THEY ARE PULLED OVER OR STOPPED FROM CONTINUING THEIR WALK WHEN THEY'RE DR- I HAVE A PERSONAL STORY OF BEING PULLED OVER. I WAS ON MY WAY TO CHURCH WITH MY TWO TEENAGE SONS DRIVING DOWN TRAVIS BOULEVARD I WAS DRIVING% AT THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC IT WAS PULLED OVER. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED INTO THE SLOW LANE A SLOW DOWN TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR AND BECAUSE THERE WAS AN EMBANKMENT I DID NOT BILL I COULD SAFELY PULL OFF THE ROAD SO I DROVE TO THE NEXT EXIT. WHEN THE OFFICER CAME OVER TO THE CAR I ASKED WHY HE PULLED ME OVER AND HE ASKED ME WHY I DIDN'T PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE. WANTS FROM THEM THEY LIKELY HAVE GUNS AND DRUGS IN THE CAR HE THEN ASKED ME FOR MY I. D. AND THE KIDS I'D BE AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE CAME BACK THAT HE TOLD ME I WAS SPEEDING AND HE WAS GIVEN ME A TICKET. THIS OFFICERS BIAS UNFORTUNATELY SEEMS TO BE THE. NORM WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR- I DON'T DRUG. I DON'T OWN A GUN. MY KIDS ARE NOT IN GAINES ORPHALI WITH GANGS. I BELIEVE HE MAY HAVE CLOCKED SOMEONE ELSE BUT BECAUSE I. THE LESS. I WOULD ARGUE THE- AND I WAS IF YOU WITHOUT. BEING BILL- AND QUAL. DATA SHOW LONG. ACROSS THE STATE AND COUNTRY MISUSED POWER. MOST FREQUENTLY DURING. STOPS TO FISH WERE IN. OR SUSPECT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WHICH PERPETUATE THE MISTRUST IN THE COMMUNITY. AND LEAD TO UNNECESSARY FATALITIES.

THE NEWEST BUILDING IS OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD THESE STRUCTURES ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF UPGRADES. AND IN ADDITION THE MPS RECENT EFFORTS TO MOVE SERVICES ONLINE AND DIRECT CUSTOMERS TO THE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY KIOSKS THAT THEY'VE ESTABLISHED STATEWIDE. MEANS THAT LARGE UNDER UTILIZED FIELD OFFICES MAY NOT BE NEEDED TO BEST SERVE CALIFORNIANS. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY NINE SIMPLY DIRECTS G. G. F. D. G. S. IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DMV AND THE RESPECTIVE CITIES TO RENOVATE THE THREE DMV FIELD OFFICES. AND INCLUDE 1100% PORTABLE HOUSING. THE STATE WILL LEASE THE PARCELS AT ZERO COST TO THE DEVELOPER IN EXCHANGE THE HOUSING DEVELOPER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING. AND THE NEW DMV FACILITIES THE M. B. SERVICES MUST CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDED DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS AND AMPLE PARKING MUST BE BUILT FOR THE PUBLIC IN THE NEW FACILITIES. AS THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY NINE PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK THE WAY THAT WE UTILIZE STATE IS TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES TO HOUSE PEOPLE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE SYLVIUS STROSS. REPRESENTING THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA IS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. HELLO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SYLVIA SOLUTION ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA THE CITY WOULD LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM FOR AUTHORING THIS MEASURE ABOUT A DECADE AGO AT THE CITY REALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS CURRENTLY UNDER UTILIZED PROPERTY AS THE CITY BELIEVES THAT THE DMV SITE IN SANTA MONICA'S IDEALLY SITUATED FOR DOUBLE HOUSE. FOR EXAMPLE THE SITE IS VERY CLOSE TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WELL PAID JOBS IN OUR CITY IT'S TWO BLOCKS FROM AN L. A. METRO EXPO LINE TRAIN. STATION AND IT IS ALSO TWO BLOCKS FROM A PUBLIC SCHOOL. THE SITE ALSO REPRESENTS ONE OF THE LARGEST PUBLICLY OWNED SITES IN THE CITY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY ACCOMMODATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. HOUSE A NEW DMV FACILITY THAT COULD BETTER ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF DMV CUSTOMERS TODAY PARTICULARLY AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED A LOT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN NOW BE PROCESSED ONLINE. THIS DEVELOPED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SITE WOULD ALSO ALIGN WITH THE CITY'S BROADER STRATEGY OF USING PUBLICLY OWNED LAND TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SUCH AS THE RECENT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY UNIT PROJECT ON CITY OWNED LAND NEAR CITY HALL. AS WELL AS ANOTHER PROJECT THAT WILL CREATE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY AFFORDABLE UNITS ON THE SIDE OF A CITY OWNED PARKING STRUCTURE. FOR THE NEXT HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE THE CITY'S RENO NUMBER IS ALMOST NINE THOUSAND UNITS 69% OF WHICH MUST BE AFFORDABLE. THE INNOVATIVE USE OF PUBLICLY OWNED LAND AS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL IS ONE WAY TO HELP THE CITY REACH ITS HOUSING GOALS AND WE ASK FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS SUPPORT THANK YOU.

EMOTION IN A SECOND SO WHEN YOU TRY TO MAKE THIS QUICK BUT I JUST DO NEED TO SAY A FEW THINGS ON. MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FIRST AND FOREMOST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE OF FOR ALL THE WORK ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- AB TWENTY FOUR OH SIX SIX TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES FROM BEING CHARGED EXCESSIVE AND UNFAIR FEES. ALSO KNOWN AS DETENTION AND DEMURRAGE BY INTERMODAL MARINE EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS. FOR REASONS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE BUSINESS BY CLARIFYING. AND MODERNIZING THE PROTECTION SET BY S. B. FORTY FIVE. SB FORTY FIVE WAS CHAPTER IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN A PERFECT PROHIBITED LEVYING OF THE CITY'S AGAINST TRUCKERS WHEN THEY THE DELAYED PICK UP OR RETURN OF A CONTAINER. IS NOT WITHIN THE CONTROL OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. HOWEVER THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT HAS EVOLVED SINCE THIS LAW WAS ADOPTED AND IT NEEDS TO BE MODERNIZED. TODAY AN APPOINTMENT IS REQUIRED TO ACCESS MARINE TERMINALS WHICH IS WAS NOT THE CASE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE MARINE TERMINALS HAVE BEGUNIMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THOSE THESE APPOINTMENTS BY LIMITING THE RETURN OF EMPTY CONVICT CONTAINERS FROM SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS. CONTROLLING WHICH LOADED CONTAINERS CAN BE PULLED OUT ORANGE TO ENTIRELY LOCKING OUT INTO CONTAINERS FROM TERMINAL FACILITIES. WHEN MARINE TERMINALS ARE OVERLY CONGESTED EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS OFTEN FAIL TO ARRANGE FOR AN ALTERNATIVE ALTERNATIVE- RETURN LOCATION RESULTING IN CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES HAVING TO HOLD THESE EMPTY CONTAINERS OUT THERE FACILITIES WHICH THEN RESULTS IN THE ACCRUAL OF LATE CHARGES. THIS PRACTICE HAS GREATLY IMPACTED AGRICULTURAL EXPORTERS WERE BEEN CHARGE EXCESSIVE LATE FEES DUE TO SHIPPING VESSELS BY PASSING EXPERT CALLS IN OAKLAND. LIVING EXPORTERS STUCK WITH LOADED CONTAINERS OCCURRING A DETENTION CHARGES FOR SHIPS THAT ARE CANCELED OR DELAYED. AS A RESULT ALGAL CULTURE EXPLORE EXPORTERS ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS AROUND THE GLOBE. IN SHORT ABUSIVE DETENTION AND DEMURRAGE PRACTICES WORSEN SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS BY MONETIZING DELAYS TO THE BENEFIT OF THE QUICKENING PROVIDERS AT THE COST OF. CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. HOWEVER I DO WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY MET WITH THE OPPONENTS MULTIPLE TIMES AND I AM COMMITTING TO YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO ADDRESS. AS MANY OF THOSE CONCERNS IT'S POSSIBLE WITH RATED TESTIFIED TODAY'S CHRISTIAN MODE ON BEHALF OF ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. AND ROGER IT IS SOME FROM THE WESTERN AGRICULTURAL PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION AT THE CALIFORNIA COTTON JENNER'S AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION DILLON. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR FRIEDMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KRISHNADAS CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FOUR OH SIX WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY SIXTY FIVE OF THE NATION'S LEADING SUPPLY CHAIN ORGANIZATIONS AS STATED BY THE AUTHOR AB TWENTY FOUR OH SIX UPDATES EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW TO BETTER PROTECT CALIFORNIA TRUCKERS IMPORTERS IN AG EXPORTERS FROM UNFAIR CHIEF FEES CHARGED BY OCEAN CARRIERS. THESE FEES ARE KNOWN AS DETENTION AND DEMURRAGE WHICH PENALIZE THE LATE PICK UP OR RETURN OF SHIPPING CONTAINERS HOWEVER TRUCKERS IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS ARE OFTEN BUILD EVEN WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS MARINE TERMINALS DUE TO THE CHIU ASIANS OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. A WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS SAY YOU RENTED A CAR AND TRIED TO RETURN IT ON A MONDAY THE RENTAL AGENCY SAYS SORRY THE LOT IS FULL RIGHT NOW BRING THE CAR BACK ON FRIDAY THEN PROCEEDS TO CHARGE YOU RENTAL FEES FOR THOSE FIVE DAYS THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW DETENTION AND DEMURRAGE WORKS TODAY. THESE UNFAIR FEES INCREASE COSTS FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND HARM TRADE DEPENDENT CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND JOBS ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE FACT SHEET ON THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY OCEAN CARRIERS BILL TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN DETENTION AND DEMURRAGE OVER JUST A THREE MONTH PERIOD LAST YEAR IN INDUSTRY RESEARCH FOUND THAT THESE FEES OR TWO TO TEN TIMES HIGHER CALIFORNIA PORTS AND OTHER PORTS WORLDWIDE. CALIFORNIA WITH THE ADOPTION SB FORTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE WHICH THIS BILL WOULD AMEND LED THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION ON DETENTION DEMERGER FORM THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WILL ENSURE THAT RENEWED STATE AND FEDERAL EFFORTS TO REFORM DETENTION DEMURRAGE PRACTICES ARE ALIGNED WE LIKE TO THINK THEAUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. REPRIAND CHURN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ROGER ISOM. ON THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA CONGENERS AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS. THE COTTON INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE WESTERN AGRICULTURAL PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION. WHICHREPRESENTS THE TREE NOT HAULING AND PROCESSING INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA. OF ALMONDS WALNUTS PECANS AND PISTACHIOS. I'M THE CARD IS THREE EXPORTS 1100% OF THE COTTON PRIEST IN CALIFORNIA THE TREE DOWN THE STREET ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE FOUR TREE NUTS EXPORTS 70% OF ITS PRODUCTS SO CONSEQUENCES CONSEQUENTLY THE CRISIS AT THE PORTS OF LA LONG BEACH AND OAKLAND HAS HAD A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OUR MEMBERS WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LOST SALES REDUCED INCOME AND THEN TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY. INCREASED FEES IN THE FORM OF THE TENSION DEMURRAGE. AB TWENTY FOUR OH SIX WHAT ADDRESS A PORTION OF THE ISSUE FOR US. AND THAT IS WHEN WE ASSESS THE DETENTION DEMURRAGE FEES WHEN IT'S NOT OUR FAULT. WE HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF BEING ASSESSED THESE FEES. ARE RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN FEES THAT WERE AGAIN NOT OUR FAULT THEY WERE EITHER CANCELLATION OF A SHIP. A DELAY OF A SHIP OR ROLL OVER TO THE NEXT SHIP. I'M MORE WE HAVE TO PAY THOSE FEES WHEN IT WHEN THE LAWYERS OUR FAULT WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND EXPECT THE FEE BUT ONE IS NOT IT SHOULD NOT BE ASSESSED TO US. THIS IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BILL AND WE ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY FOUR OH SIX TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE ONE OPPOSITION WITNESS- REGISTERED MIKE JACOB MISTER JACOB YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME UP TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

I'M NOT JUST ON THIS BILL BUT ON A PANOPLY OF SUPPLY CHAIN EFFORTS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND HAVING A CONVERSATION- AND WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE AND- AND WOULD. READILY AGREE WITH FOLKS WERE FRUSTRATED ABOUT THE STATE OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN WHERE A CRISIS IT'S UNPRECEDENTED- AND IT HAS RESULTED IN. NUMEROUS COSTS FOR LOTS OF PARTIES- LOTS OF LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S BEING EXPERIENCED IT'S A CUTE- AND THAT IS NOT LIMITED TO CARGO OWNERS AND SOFFICI FELT ACROSS THE CARRIER CONTINUUM AS WELL FOR MOTOR CARRIERS LIKE MISTER SCHMIDT IS MEMBERS OF THE TRUCKING ASSOCIATION BUT ALSO FOR OCEAN CARRIERS- WITH RESPECT OUR PRODUCTIVITY OUR EFFICIENCY- THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU IS. IS NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE AS- ONE MIGHT BE LED TO BELIEVE GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SPACE WERE WORKING IN- THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF WHAT'S LIMITED UNDER CURRENT LAW WITH RESPECT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MARINE TERMINALS AND TRUCKS DISCREET. IT'S LIMITED NATURE AND WHAT AB TWENTY FOUR SIX IS ATTEMPTING TO DO ESSENTIALLY IS TO EXPAND THAT. TO MILLIONS AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN MILLIONS OF PARTIES WORLDWIDE- IT'S A- IT'S AN AREA OF THE LAW WHICH IS AGAIN COMPLEX IT'S FEDERALLY REGULATED. ALL OF THE OPERATIONS THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN A KERR AND I CONTEXT OF THE FEDERAL SHIPPING OUT WHICH IS- AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION. THOSE RULES IN THE FRUSTRATION THAT THAN UNDER LIGHT THIS BILL THAT WE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND WE AGAIN WILL BE SITTING DOWN AND GETTING THE WORK ON THIS BILL- HAVE LED TO CONGRESSIONAL. REFORM LEGISLATION IN BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE BEING PASSED. THAT LEGISLATION IS BEING WORKED OUT IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IF ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR MEDINA. A QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION- I GREW UP IN A PLACE WHERE. NEXT TO THE PANAMA CANAL WATCH A CONTAINER SHIPS GO BY GO THROUGH THE PANAMA CANAL. A JOB MY HIGH SCHOOL. AND SO FAMILIAR WITH WITH WITH- GOODS MOVEMENT AND I REPRESENT- RIVERSIDE WHERE A LOT OF THE GOODS AND UP MOVING THROUGH. SO THE QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION IS HOW. DO YOU JUSTIFY ADDING ADDITIONAL PENALTIES TO FOLKS WHO USE THOSE% A FOR- OTHER TRANSPORTATION WHEN- LENGTH OF TIME. IS NOT UNDER THEIR CONTROL YES SIR IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO THERE'S THE TWO FOLD- IT IS ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A CARGO OWNER- AND OCEAN CARRIER ANY OTHER CARRIER FOR THAT MATTER THERE'S A THERE'S A CONTRACT THAT'S INVOLVED WITH RESPECT TO BOTH THE CARRIAGE IN THE AND THE INTERCHANGE OF THAT EQUIPMENT- BOTH OF THOSE THINGS SPECIFY. THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THOSE ARE USE THEIR NEGOTIATED- THOSE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LAW- SO TO THE EXTENT THAT ANYONE BELIEVE THAT THOSE ARE DONE. IN A WAY WHICH IS IMPROPER OR THEIR OWN FAIR THIS COMPLAINT PROCESS FOR THAT AND PEOPLE GO THROUGH THAT OUR MEMBERS ABIDE BY THAT- AND HAVE BEEN FINED- AND THERE ARE ACTIONS AGAINST THOSE FOR THESE VERY SAME THINGS WHICH ARE BEING COMPLAINED ABOUT HERE- I THINK THE QUESTION FOR THIS BILL IS WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE WANTS TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL LAYER. OF STEPPING INTO THAT PROCESS AS WELL- BUT THE BASIS FOR HOW YOU MOVE CARGO IS A CONTRACT ON THOSE TERMS ARE NEGOTIATED- WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTIES FEEL LIKE TO HAVE THE BARGAINING POWER THAT THEY'RE OF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR I THINK IS OBVIOUSLY UP FOR DEBATE- BUT PEOPLE HAVE EYES WIDE OPEN MOVING NTO THAT BUT WHAT I WILL SAY- MOVING INTO WHERE WE ARE AT THE PANDEMIC- IS. WE ARE DEALING WITH UNPRECEDENTED SITUATIONS- THEY HAVE RESULTED IN ON PRESIDENT NANA FINDS. DISRUPTIONS AND THINGS WHICH WERE NOT ANTICIPATED SO THOSE THINGS HAVE TO WORK THEMSELVES THROUGH THIS PROCESS. PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINTS NEED TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS WITH SET UP UNDER FEDERAL LAW ARE RIGHT NOW- AND THAT IS OCCURRING- BUT THE FINES ARE NOT A SURPRISE. TO FOLKS WHO ARE OPERATING UNDER THE CONTRACT WHICH OUTLINES THE FINES OR THEY'RE UNDER A TARIFF. ON WHICH ALREADY EXISTS AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY A PORT- BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF WHERE WE'RE SITTING RIGHT NOW. THOSE OF THOSE ARE NOT AGAIN NOT A SURPRISE TO ANYONE ON THE KNOW WHAT THE TERMS ARE- THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE APPLICATION OF THOSE THOSE ARE FAIR- AND THEN WHO'S GOING TO BE THE ARBITER. OF WHETHER NOT THEIR FAIR WINNER POST. THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW IF THE- SIDE WANTS TO RESPOND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARMENIANS QUESTION AND MISTER JACOBS RESPONSE YOU KNOW- WE WOULD JUST SAY THAT- SB FORTY FIVE WAS PASSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER WE ARE STILL HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF DETENTION DEMURRAGE AND SO. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE FINAL DISCUSSIONS ARE PRODUCTIVE IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WILL ENSURE THAT- WHATEVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES OR DOES NOT END UP DOING IS ALIGNED WITH THOSE FEDERAL EFFORTS SO I THINK THERE'S WIDE RECOGNITION THAT A DETENTION DEMURRAGE NEEDS- FOR THE SCRUTINY- IN THE FAIRNESS OF THOSE FEES- NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED. THANK YOU. MISTER GIBSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION- AND ONE WHO REPRESENTS THE YOU KNOW FOR LOS ANGELES- AND THE GOODS MOVEMENT COMING IN AND OUT- I THINK WE I AND I'VE BEEN WITH AND MET WITH AND TAKEN TOURS OF BUSINESSES OF SOMETIME THERE ARE OUT OF THE OUT OF- ONES- CONTROL IF A SHIP DECIDES THEY DON'T WANT ANYMORE CAN IN CONTAINERS. THEN THOSE COMPANIES HAVE TO HOLD THEM AND THEY HAVE TO HOLD THEM AND KERR THE COSTS. OF AND NOW AND THEN TO BE PENALIZED AS A RESULT OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS TRYING TO GET AT THE CRUX. OF MAKING SURE- THAT WHEN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN THAT THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT UNFAIRLY- PENALIZED BECAUSE IF A SHIP REJECTED FOR WHATEVER REASON BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN. ARM THERE IS THE BURDENS ON THE- OWNER OR WHO OWNS THE CONTAINERS AND SOMETIME THEY CAN SIT FOR DAYS I'M AT A TIME UNTIL WHATEVER THEY FEEL LIKE ASKING FOR THOSE CONTAINERS TO BE UP TO BE BROUGHT FORTH. AND I THINK THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS MAKING SURE THAT THESE ARE BUSINESSES STAY AFLOAT- BUT ALSO I HEARD THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK- AND TRYING TO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND- SO THAT WE CAN LEAST ADDRESS THIS NOT THINK THIS. ADDRESS AND BRINGS THE CONVERSATION- TO LIGHT AND SO- AM I CORRECT IN TERMS OF THAT MIKE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT THE YEAH AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL- IN YOUR YOUR EXACTLY CORRECT- WE HAVE A CONGESTION CRISIS- AND WE DO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE CANNOT ACCEPT- BOXES THE TERMINALS ARE FULL. A AND THERE IS A CONSEQUENCES. AND THAT THAT IS PHYSICALLY OCCURRING RIGHT YOU CAN'T CHANGE LAWS OF PHYSICS- AND IF YOU CAN ONLY ACCEPT SO MANY BOXES WHEN YOU'RE FULL SORRY SORRY EXACTLY RIGHT ABOUT THAT AGAIN THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH THOSE CONTRACTS AND THE QUESTION OF IMPOSITION OF FEES. AND WHOSE ARBITER OVER THOSE QUESTIONS- SO ARE QUITE OUR OUR ISSUE WITH THE BILL FRANKLY IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE A PROCESS FOR RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS- IT'S WHAT'S THE EXTENT OF THAT A PROCESS HOW MUCH OF IT SHOULD BE HAPPENING AT THE STATE LEVEL HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE YOU BEGIN TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S A FEDERAL PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHAT'S REASONABLE AND FAIR. AND THOSE WILL BE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WELL I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE- AND FOR ACCEPTING AMEND AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL AND I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND HER FOR HER TENACIOUS NESS AND HER PASSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHE KNOWS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF OUR EXPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK WE ALL HAVE SYMPATHY. WITH THE HAVOC THAT COOPER NINETEEN IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES OF HAD ON CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND I ALSO APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION WE'RE ALSO OF COURSE IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS I'M I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AT THIS POINT IS THAT WHILE THERE'S A FEDERAL LAW MAKING HAPPENING THAT YOU'VE THE BILL WILL CONFORM WITH ANY FEDERAL REGULATION SO THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE AN OUT LIAR OR BEING IN BE IN CONFLICT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY FOUR ADDRESSES INEQUITY IN OUR WHOLE SYSTEM. THIS WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY A NEW STORY IN THE BAY AREA WHERE I SHOCKINGLY FOUND OUT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY RESIDENT WAS FACING A BILL OF OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE THAN 90% AND PENALTIES. SIMPLY BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL HAD BEEN DRIVING ACROSS OUR BRIDGES GETTING NOTIFICATIONS NEVER GOT THE NOTIFICATIONS BUT KEPT GETTING CONTINUOUSLY FIND. THE BILL DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS IT REQUIRES DMV TO NOTIFY PEOPLE TO UPDATE THEIR VEHICLE REGISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'LL GET NOTICE OF THAT WHOLE REQUIRES RENTAL AGENCIES TO NOTIFY PEOPLE OF THEIR ABILITY TO REGISTER THE PLIGHT OF AGENCIES THAT THE CAP ON THE FIND AGENCIES CAN OPPOSE. A REQUIRES TO AGENCIES TO SET UP A PAYMENT PLAN REQUIRES TOLL AGENCIES TO HAVE A CASH PAYMENT OPTIONS ESPECIALLY WE NOW RELY ON FAST TRACK DEPEND MOST PORTALS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BANKED ARE THEY CAN'T GET ACCESS TO THAT AND THEN LASTLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALLEGE IS OPERATE.

WHILE ALSO TRYING TO ADVANCE THE BILL'S COMMENDABLE GOALS WHICH I SUPPORT. AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY FOUR AIMS TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S TOLL FACILITIES CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER. THIS MAKES TREMENDOUS SENSE AND IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AT BATTLE WE ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING A TOLL EQUITY PLAN AND OUR FIRST MAJOR STEP WHICH REDUCING OUR PENALTIES BY 80% EARLIER THIS YEAR. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING HARD TO HELP PEOPLE AVOID ACCUMULATING PENALTIES. DUE TO THE SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO COVERT. CALTRANS WISELY MADE A QUICK DECISION TO REMOVE CASH PAYMENT PAYMENT OPTIONS FROM THE BRIDGES. RECOGNIZING HOW ABRUPT BROUGHT THIS CHANGE WAS FOR MOTORISTS WHO WERE USED TO PAYING WITH CASH. WE SUSPENDED PENALTIES THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SHIFTED TO A SYSTEM WHERE THE FIRST NOTICE A PERSON RECEIVES ISN'T A VIOLATION AT ALL. IT'S AN INVOICE AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE THAT WE CONTINUE TO TAKE THIS APPROACH. AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY FOUR WOULD ALSO MANDATE PAYMENT PLANS FOR UNPAID. PENALTIES WHILE THE DETAILS ARE STILL BEING WORKED OUT WE ALL AGREE WITH THE CONCEPT OF HELPING MOTORISTS. METER TOLL OBLIGATIONS ON A SCHEDULE WITHIN THEIR BUDGET.

TWENTY FOUR NINETY SIX. YOU HAVE A MOTION YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE RIGHT BUTTON THAT'S ON THE TABLE. ON THE TABLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M HERE TO AT PRESENT AB TWO FOUR NINE SIX WHICH PROVIDES LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH A MUCH NEEDED OOL TO CURB HARMFUL NOISE POLLUTION BY REQUIRING DRIVERS TICKETED FOR MODIFYING THEIR EXHAUST TO IMPLY THE NOISE OF THEIR VEHICLE TO PROVE THAT THEY FIXED THE MODIFICATION OR FACE A HOLD ON THE REGISTRATION. NOISE POLLUTION HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES CONSISTENT EXPOSURE TO NOISE CAN HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON HUMAN HEALTH INCLUDING STRESS ANXIETY DEPRESSION HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART DISEASE STUDIES HAVE EVEN SHOWN THAT CONSISTENT EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE MAY AFFECT CHILDREN'S COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT LAB VEHICLES ARE A MAJOR AND GROWING SOURCE OF NOISE POLLUTION IT ACCORDING TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT REYES POLLUTION IS OFTEN CAUSED BY VEHICLES THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY MODIFIED TO EXCEED NOISE LIMITS. UNDER CURRENT LAW DRIVERS TICKETED FOR ILLEGALLY MODIFIED EXHAUSTS CAN OPT TO PAY A FINE RATHER THAN FIX THE MODIFICATION WITHOUT REQUIRING DRIVERS TO FIX THE PROBLEM LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE LEFT WITH OUT THE PREVENTIVE TOOL THEY NEED TO CURB HARMFUL NOISE POLLUTION FROM VEHICLES AB TWO FOUR NINE SIX WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING DRIVERS TICKETED FOR ILLEGALLY MODIFIED EXHAUST TO PROVE THAT THEY REMOVE THE MODIFICATION WITH IN THREE MONTHS THIS WILL PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY MARK SAVAGE FROM STREETS FOR ALL WHO I BELIEVE IS TESTIFYING VIA PHONE. THANK YOU. YES WE CAN PLEASE GO AHEAD.

THIS AARON. WHEN I O'DONNELL. WARD WORN I WICKS WICKS I. EIGHT ZERO THAT BILL IS NOT LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND YOUR NEXT BILL IS AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN. THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR I'M HERE TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN THIS BILL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA REACH ITS CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS BY INCENTIVIZING INCREASED PRODUCTION. AND USE A VERY LOW TO CARBON NEUTRAL TRANSPORTATION FUELS. DIESEL CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION SECTOR DIESEL POWERED HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF SMOG FORMING POLLUTION AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE WORK TO BUILD OUR CLEAN ENERGY ZERO EMISSION FUTURE WE NEED MORE POLICY TOOLS RIGHT NOW TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND TO HELP SUPPORT. THE DECARBONISATION OF FUELS AB TWO SEVEN NINE SEVEN I WILL COMPLEMENT THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD BY OFFERING ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES. THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM HIGH CARBON FUELS. NOW PLEASE BE JOINED BY TWO WITNESSES JULIE ELEVEN FROM BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND PATRICK HUNTING. FROM THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THANK YOU- YOU ONLY TO PUSH THE BUTTON. THANK YOU THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON JULIA LEVIN WITH A BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ABOUT A HUNDRED PUBLIC AGENCIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT ARE CONVERTING ORGANIC WASTE TO ENERGY TO MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WILL ACCELERATE THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF VERY LOW CARBON CARBON NEGATIVE FUELS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS CRITICAL TO MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND I WAS THE ONE WHO PRODUCED THE SLIDES THAT ARE IN FRONT OF YOU AND I AND HOPEFULLY THEY REALLY UNDERSCORE THE URGENCY OF THESE MEASURES. WE KNOW FROM CLIMATE SCIENCE THE BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IN FACT THE ONLY THING THEY CAN BEGIN TO COOL THE CLIMATE RIGHT AWAY IS THE REDUCTION OF SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. AND CALIFORNIA THE BIGGEST SOURCES ARE GANNETT WASTE AND BY FAR THE MOST BENEFICIAL ALTERNATIVE TO LANDFILLING OR OPEN BURNING THAT WASTE IS TO CONVERT IT TO A LOW CARBON CARBON NEGATIVE TRANSPORTATION FUELS. PRESIDENT BIDEN THE HEAD OF THE UNITED NATIONS THE HEAD OF THE IPCC ALL SAY THAT THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST URGENT THING WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE. THESE ARE ALSO THE SAME MEASURES THAT CAN PROVIDE CARBON NEGATIVE EMISSIONS WHICH WE NEED TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY MID CENTURY. AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THE AIRPORT HAS SAID THESE ARE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE OF ALL OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE INVESTMENTS DESPITE ALL OF THAT THE AIRPORT IS SAID WE ARE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET OUR SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT REQUIREMENTS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW. SO THIS BILL IS REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ACCELERATE NOT JUST THE USE OF LOW CARBON A CARBON NEGATIVE FUELS BUT FUELS THAT COULD HELP US REDUCE METHANE BLACK CARBON AND OTHER SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND URGED THE COMMITTEE TO PASS IT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR NEXT WITNESS. LAUGHTER COMMITTEE ON PATRICK CUTTING WITH THE COALITION FOR GLOBAL NATURAL GAS. OUR MEMBERSHIP IS MADE UP OF CONSTRUCTION LABOR UNIONS. OF CITIES COUNTIES UTILITIES- AND- INDUSTRY PARTNERS THAT PRODUCE 95% OF THE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. A NORTH AMERICA. CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A WORLD LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY BUT IT ALSO HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE- WITH DROUGHTS WILDFIRES. CONTINUED ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES- IN RESPONSE TO- THE SPEAKER PRO TEM GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CONTINUED CALL TO WRAP UP OUR INVESTMENT EFFORTS- INTO- MEET. OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND LOWER EMISSIONS. OF THIS BUDGET YEAR TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN WILL DO THIS. HELP CALIFORNIA REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL BY INCENTIVIZING INCREASED PRODUCTION AND USE. THE VERY LOW TO NET NEGATIVE CARBON FUELS- GIVEN THE STATE'S CLIMATE- REGENCY THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AND WE'RE PROUD TO JOIN. THE DEPARTMENTAL GROUPS IN SUPPORT OF THIS. MEASURE THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING US REACH OUR- GOALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO HAVE ONE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION JAMIE CATS ON THE TELEPHONE OPERATOR IF YOU CAN FIND JIMMY KATZ PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON HELLO HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JAMIE COMPLEMENT ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY CALLING INTEREST PRESS NOW I'M HERE EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION AND NONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES FROM FOOD AND WATER WATCH YOUR CLUB CALIFORNIA AND IF THE- RESIDENTS TO AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY STOP WE'RE ALARMS THAT WOULD DIRECT SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR A FALSE SOLUTION TO CALIFORNIA'S MANDATE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. WE OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR THREE REASONS FIRST BECAUSE THE FURTHER INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF SO CALLED NET NEGATIVE CARBON FUEL ESPECIALLY BIO METHANE DERIVED FROM INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE. INDUSTRIAL SCALE DAIRIES POLLUTE THE WATER AND AIR OF NEARBY COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE FACTORY FARM GAS DOES NOT MITIGATE THE IMPACTS THE PRODUCTION OF FACTORY FARM GAS REQUIRED LARGE CONCENTRATED ANIMAL HERDS AND LIQUEFIED MANURE. PLEASE WHICH ARE THE MOST POLLUTING PRACTICES INCENTIVES TO PRODUCE THIS GAS OR ACCELERATING CONCENTRATION OF DAIRY HERDS IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH GAS INFRASTRUCTURE THE SECOND FACTORED FORM GOT DID NOT A REAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS NOR DO THEY REPRESENT ACTUAL REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THE PRODUCTION OF FACTORY FARMED OUT TO ONLY APPEARS CARBON NEGATIVE BECAUSE THE LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS EXCLUDES BOTH UP AND DOWNSTREAM EMISSIONS. AND IGNORES HEARD AND WE'RE MANAGEMENT CHOICES WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS MINUSCULES COMBUSTED AS TRANSPORTATION FUEL IT GENERATES BOTH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND LOCALIZED AIR POLLUTION FINALLY THIS BILL WOULD INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF AT THE TOP OF THE BRIDGE YOU ALL WENT FUNDING SHOULD BE INCREASED SHOULD INSTEAD BE DIRECTED TO ACCELERATE REAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS WE MUST NOT LET THIRTY THREE LEAD TO SEEMINGLY SIMPLE SOLUTIONS BOB ALSO WISHES. FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE THIS BILL WE'VE SPOKEN WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE I WOULD LOVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THIS SUPPORT THE TRANSPORTATION TRANSITION THAT EXCEED CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS. WILL NOT FURTHER POLLUTING COME A. B. AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS ANYONE IN THE WISHING TO TEST IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MEASURE MEMBERS INJURY AND WE ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN PROPANE GAS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. VENTURA MEMBERS RYAN KENNY FROM CLEAN ENERGY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

CHRIS CHAVEZ OF COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANYONE ON THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS AND I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW MENTION THAT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AROUND SOME THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED- YOU KNOW ABOUT CREATING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND MAYBE- INCENTIVIZING CERTAIN ACTIONS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO AND ALSO- WHETHER OR NOT THIS INVESTMENT WITH THAT WHETHER OR NOT THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT REALLY WARRANTS- THE INVESTMENT BUT BUT I VERY MUCH. TRUST THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR WILL WILL WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK OUT ANY ISSUES THAT THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO- SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN COMMITTEE TODAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND DAD YES I'M CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND ADDITIVE TO FORGE A COHERENT STRATEGY AND DIED AND I HOPE THAT THE PATH FORWARD THAT TAX. IF THEY CAN CAN GET BY. ANYONE ELSE. SO I WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION PROTESTS BUYING TODAY AND RAISING CONCERNS THESE WERE LATE BREAKING CONCERNS FOR US WHICH IS WHY I'M A NON RECCO TODAY- BUT WILL SUPPORT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD SO THAT I AND OTHERS CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT AND EVALUATE IT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I AND THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AS YOU YOU SAID THESE WERE. SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPOSITION WE'RE WE'RE REYES VERY LATE IN THE PROCESS- WE'RE CERTAINLY. COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM AND- INSURING THAT THEY'RE NOT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH THE POLICIES THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING. A YEAH I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CALLS I REALLY DO THINK WE NEED TO TAKE IN ALL OF THE ABOVE. APPROACH I THINK ALONG SIDE INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING TO BUILD UP ZERO EMISSION. VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. I'VE INVESTMENTS ARE MAKING TO INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WE NEED TO COUPLE THAT WITH SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS THAT FIVE WILL GET US ON THAT PATH SO. I'M SHE ATE AT THE THAT. QUESTIONS AND CONVERSATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A POSITION ON THAT. AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY BUT- OKAY DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION. AND WE HAVE A SECOND ROLL CALL PLEASE. TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN HI FONG. FONG I BERMAN BERMAN AYE CHAN CHAN I DALY. DAVIES DAVIES I GIPSON. KALRA LEE LEAD NOT VOTING. MEDINA THIS AREA. WHEN I O'DONNELL. WARD FORD I WICKS WICKS I. EIGHT ZERO EIGHT ZERO THE BILL IS OUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER MOORE SAID SHE IS NOT HERE YET SO MR BERMAN ID LIKE TO PRESENT. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FOR MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED ON BEHALF OF OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY I THINK THIS IS MY SECOND TIME PRESENTING A BILL FOR MR MCCARTY IN A WEEK FIRST THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY IS HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. CALIFORNIA IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND LEADS THE NATION IN SETTING AND MAINTAINING AIR QUALITY AND EMISSIONS STANDARDS HOWEVER THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR REMAINS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE. CALIFORNIA'S GOAL OF TRANSITIONING TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IS CRITICAL TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND STEM THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT IT WILL PUT NEW DEMANDS ON CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC GRID ELECTRICAL GRID PLANNING IS NECESSARY IN TIME IS NEEDED TO UPGRADE THE GREAT CHANGE FOR IT IS READY TO SUPPORT THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING. THESE UPGRADES CAN TAKE YEARS CREATING A BOTTLENECK THAT COULD DELAY PROGRESS TOWARDS THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION GOALS BY REQUIRING CARP TO SHARE ELECTRIC FLEET DATA WITH THE STATE'S UTILITIES SO THEY CAN BETTER ANTICIPATE ELECTRICITY DEMAND AB TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED WILL ENABLE PROACTIVE GRID PLANNING AND KEEP CALIFORNIA ON TRACK TOWARDS ITS AMBITIOUS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TARGETS. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE STEP THAT ALIGNS CALIFORNIA'S GRID PLANNING PROCESS PROCESS SEES WITH THE STATE'S IS THEY HAVE AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE GOALS ARE SPECIALLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND WITH ME- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR MILES MULLIN- MULLER OR MUELLER I APOLOGIZE- BY PHONE. IN ADAM SMITH HERE IN PERSON. THANK YOU YOU- WHO WHICH WITNESS- IS IT THE PHONE WITNESS FIRST SURE WHY NOT OKAY- I OPERATE IF YOU CAN PLEASE FIND MR MILLER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS MILES MULLER CLIMBING CLEAN ENERGY TTORNEY AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. AND I'M PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED. AB TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED IN A CRITICAL MEASURE FOR KEEPING CALIFORNIA ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE ITS AIR QUALITY CLIMATE GOAL. MIND SHARING THE LEXICOGRAPHER CARE TO SUPPORT TRANSPORTATION OCCUPATION. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN BASIS GOLDEN REGULATIONS FOR ELECTRIFYING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR GOALS OF HAVING MISSION BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. TO MEET THAT GOAL DEJECTED AFTER ME THE CALIFORNIA WILL NEED ROUGHLY ONE POINT TWO MILLION CHARGERS AND EIGHT MILLION EV'S ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRD. HOWEVER THE KERR JUSTIN TIME OCCUR FOR. READ UPGRADE MY CUSTOMERS INTEGRATING LARGE ELECTRIFICATION WOULD REQUIRE UTILITY SERVICE. RESULT IN DELAYS BARRIERS AND LARGER COSTS. THEY WILL ULTIMATELY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO REALIZE THE CLIMATE TRANSPORTATION GOLD. THAT BY CALIFORNIA'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND STATE REGULATIONS LIKE THE ADVANCED GREEN TRUCK. AND A VAN CLEEF WITHDRAWALS. IN ORDER TO REPAIR THE GRID THE ATTIC SERVE ALL THE NEW ELECTRIC CARS AND TRUCKS COMING OVER THE NEXT DECADE. WE NEEDA MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH TO GRID PLANNING AND SERVING ITS CUSTOMERS. AB TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED WOULD ENABLE THIS BY BETTER INFORMING STRATEGIC PLANNING SO WE HAVE TO CREATE NEED TO ACCOMMODATE WIDESPREAD TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. WHEN WE NEED IT TO MEET THE STATE. CLIMATE AIR QUALITY IN EQUITY GOAL. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR SUPPORTING THE ELECTROCUTION OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. WHICH WILL VOTE WHICH WILL PROVIDE MUCH INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THAT OFF IN THE NEAR FREEWAYS PORTS RAIL YARDS AND OTHER FACILITIES. THE GENERATING IT AGAIN LEVELS OF ENGINEERS OUT. SO WE MORE TWO DECLINING INVESTMENT ELECTRIFICATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CAN BE COST EFFECTIVE. IT'S ALL THE PROGRESS WITH ITS- AND MAXIMIZE BENEFITS FOR ALL UTILITY CUSTOMERS. INSTALLING ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO CHARGE THE VEHICLES WILL NOT ONLY HELP THE BIG NEEDED CLIMATE EQUITY IN OUR QUALITY GOALS. BUT ALSO COLOR TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION COULD PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON WHAT YOU'RE GRAYSON BUILD. TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL CHARACTERS. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FINANCING OF COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL AND RESPECTFULLY- DRIVER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND YOU HAVE A WITNESS IN PERSON ADAM SMITH. IF YOU PUSH THE BUTTON THEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THERE WE- JEFF IN CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- SMITH A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SHARING OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED. I THINK THE PROBLEM STATEMENT THE GOALS THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS ALL BEEN LAID OUT VERY WELL SO I WON'T RETREAD THAT GROUND. BUT I WILL SAY I THINK THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP IS HAVING REAL RESULTS IN THIS AREA. AS PORTS WAREHOUSES AND OTHER BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GRID IS READY FOR THEM. AB TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOES JUST THAT. IT WOULD ENSURE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS LIKE OURS CAN MEET CRITICAL GRID INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN ANTICIPATION OF INCREASED VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION. THE BILL WOULD HAVE CARP AS YOU'VE HEARD SHARE FLEET DATA WITH ENTITIES COMPLYING WITH THE REGULATIONS WITH US THE UTILITIES. SO THAT WE CAN PLAN APPROPRIATELY AND READY THE GRANT FOR THE VEHICLES THESE COMPANIES PLAN TO PLUG INTO IT. AB TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED GETS UTILITIES WHAT WE NEED TO PLAN APPROPRIATELY BUT THEN ALSO DIRECTS US TO TAKE ACTION. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE UTILITIES WITH ANNUAL FLEET DATA ALLOWING. US TO FORECAST AND ANTICIPATE FUTURE ELECTRIFICATION EXPANSION WITH GREATER CONFIDENCE. THIS DATA WILL INFORM PLANS THAT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WILL SEND TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOR APPROVAL. AND ONCE APPROVED WE GET TO WORK. WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS GOOD IDEA FOR WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN FOR PRESENTING IT TODAY. WE SUPPORT IT AS AN IMPLEMENTING UTILITY AND WE URGE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO SUPPORT IT TODAY AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO HAVE ONE WITNESS- IN OPPOSITION PATRICK WELCH. AND YOU MAY COME UP TO THE TABLE IF YOU LIKE SIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS HAVE HAD TO GO TO THE CALIFORNIA MINISTRY TOLD THE ASSOCIATION OF KEEP IT BRIEF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. AND THE SPONSORS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS OUR MEMBERS AT WHICH PROVIDE ELECTRICITY HELPING TO DEPLOY EV'S WITH EVEY REBATES. GETTING THEIR GRADE READY EINSTEIN CHARGERS WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT THAT REQUIRES. UTILITIES TO MAKE TIMELY UPGRADES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT EVEY- INFRASTRUCTURE WE THINK THAT IS OVERLY BROAD AND VAGUE AND CREATE SOME LEGAL JEOPARDY AND I THINK THE MEHMET'S ADOPTED TODAY MOVE US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE THINK SOME ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS ARE PROBABLY NEEDED. A TOWARDS THAT END AND ONE THING I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE POINT OUT UTILITIES AS WELL. THERE ARE CURRENTLY HUGE SUPPLY CAKE. A CHAIN CONSTRAINTS ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR ELECTRIC INDUSTRY USED TO TAKE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS TO GET A TRANSFORMER NOW TAKES TWO TO THREE YEARS AT A COST INCREASE OF ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORD TIMELY UPGRADES THERE ARE THINGS ARE OUT OF CONTROL OF OUR MEMBERS HANDS. GLOBAL ISSUES THAT WE CANNOT CONTROL THAT WE CANNOT FIX WE ARE URGING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANY AUTHORITY TO DO SO- AND WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH AUTHORED ADDRESSES CONCERNS IN THE FOR THE FOR THE REFINING THE LANGUAGE.

THIS BILL IS CONTINUING THE THEME OF A BUILDING OUT THE NECESSARY EVEY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR US TO REACH NOT ONLY ARE. ELECTRIC VEHICLE GOALS BUT ALSO ALSO OUR CLIMATE GOALS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS CONVENIENT RELIABLE AND EQUITABLE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS SIR DIAZ WITH CHARGEPOINT. AND ALSO KAREN SWORE AS A WITH THE MAKING HOPE HAPPEN FOUNDATION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM SO SORRY IS SENIOR POLICY MANAGER FOR CHARGEPOINT. FIRST YOU WANT TO THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS CG FOR AUTHORING THIS MEASURE AND FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BENNETT PLUMAS RIOS FOR COOPER IN THE MEASURE AS WELL AS A COMMITTEE STAFFER ASSISTING US IN THIS MATTER. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL OF MAKING CALIFORNIA SENSORS INTO ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM A SUCCESS. BUT IT COULD ONLY BE CALLED SUCCESS IF EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO NUMBER FROM INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE. THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. YOU CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE MUST BE CONVENIENT RELIABLE EASY TO OPERATE AND ACCESSIBLE IN ALL NEIGHBORHOODS TO ALL DRIVERS BOTH CURRENT. AND FUTURE. AB TWENTY SEVEN OF THREE DOES TWO IMPORTANT REQUIRES A CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS. AND REQUIRES CC DEVELOP RELIABILITY STANDARDS FOR E. EVEY CHARGING STATIONS AND CONDITIONS UPON WHICH IS THE FUNDING COMPLIANCE WITH RELIABILITY STANDARDS. AS A CHARGING ECOSYSTEM EXPANDS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE- INSURE THE RELIABILITY OF THE STATE'S EXISTING IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CDC AND- RESEARCHERS BOARD HAVE BOTH IDENTIFY EAST ASIA ABILITIES A TOP CONCERN FOR YOU DRIVERS. AND THE CC RECENTLY HELD A WORKSHOP ON SUCH TOPICS FURTHER. THIS MEASURE WILL HELP DEVELOP RELIABILITY STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC HE RECHARGE STATIONS THAT WILL ENSURE THE DRIVERS HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE. THE STATE RECEIVED A RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENT INCREASE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN STATE TV INFRASTRUCTURE. ONCE AGAIN WE WERE SITTING SOMEWHERE MURATSUCHI. FOR OFFERING THIS BILL WILL AFFORD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THE CO AUTHORS THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT.

IN DISADVANTAGED OR WHAT WE CALL PRIORITY NEIGHBORHOODS TO CHARGE THEIR ELECTRIC VEHICLES EXISTING EVEN INFRASTRUCTURE THE LESS ACCESSIBLE FOR PRIORITY POPULATIONS PARTICULARLY IN DECEMBER THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN ST BERNARD YOU KNOW RESIDENTS AN OLDER MULTI FAMILY DWELLING DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CHARGING AND THOSE THAT HAVE LIVED HERE FOR GENERATIONS AND MAY OWN OR RENT A HOME HAVE OLDER HOUSING STOCK THAT WOULD REQUIRE COSTLY UPDATES AND REPAIRS. AS A RESULT INDIVIDUAL WHO ONE EVENING MUST RELY MORE ON PUBLIC CHARGING AT RETAIL LOCATION WELL OTHER PROGRAMS PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS FOR EASY CHARGING THAT FINANCIALLY IT IS LIMITED TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE OVERSUBSCRIBED AND DELIVERED ON ONE EVEN CHARGING NETWORK THE VITAL DIFFERENTIATOR IN THIS BILL IS THAT THE PROGRAM WILL MAKE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE THROUGH A RELOADABLE PAYMENT CARD THAT HAS BOTH AN EMV CHIP AND CONTACTLESS CAPABILITIES. THAT MEANS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CAN USE OF PAYMENT CARD ANYWHERE NOT JUST AT ONE EASY CHARGING COMPANY AT A TIME THAT IS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM THIS MEASURE WILL BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS TO COMMUTE OUT OF OUR CITY FOR WORK AND PROVIDE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO FEEL AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE WE THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON.

CALEXICO AND THE I MET WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUP WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY FELT THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO THEIR RESIDENTS. MOVING OUT OF A- INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES NTV'S WHICH THEY VERY MUCH FAVOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE HUGE AIR POLLUTION IN JUST- ISSUES IS NOT THE MAN OF THE INCENTIVES BUT RATHER THE LACK OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TACKLING THAT ISSUE. I DO HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CARB AND CEEC TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THAT WE'RE PROCEEDING WITH THIS IS REALLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF HELPING WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE.
