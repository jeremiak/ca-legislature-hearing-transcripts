PRIDE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE A BRING UP TODAY BUT I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE BREACH IN THE PROGRAM WHICH IS OF COURSE NOW BEING REPAID SO IT'S RE PROCREATIVE AND SUCH A LARGE PROGRAM I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY REMARKABLE STATEMENT ABOUT THE PROGRAM ITSELF AND THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M ELIZABETH LANDS BURKE DIRECTOR BOSCH. AS INDICATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET OFFICE GROWING PORTFOLIO MAKES IT TIME TO RECAST JOSH BUT AS THE DEPARTMENT OF WE AND WE'VE GIVEN CAREFUL CONSIDERATION ON HOW TO DO THAT AS WELL AS REVIEWS ARE PROGRAMS FOR AREAS WHERE WE CAN STRENGTHEN THEM- WE HAVE REVIEWED THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORT. EARLIER REPORTS AND OTHERS MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE TO CHANNEL THE BEST THINKING AND THE NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS AND ALL OF THAT INPUT IN FORM THE PROPOSALS THAT WE ARE BRINGING FORTH. ASHTEAD LOOKS IMPROVE OUR AFFECT. IN PROVIDING THE DATA AND PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP THE STATE'S NEEDED HEALTH HEALTH CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION OF OUR DATA ASSETS AND OUR WORKFORCE. SO WE THINK THAT WITH THE ADDITION OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND THE PROPOSED CHANGES ON WORK FORCE PROGRAM DATA ASSETS THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE POISED TO BE A THOUGHT LEADER ON HEALTH ACCESSING INFORMATION. SO I'M GONNA- START WITH BOTH QUESTIONS ONE AND TWO AND GOING THROUGH EACH ELEMENT OF OUR PROPOSAL THANK YOU AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE OTHER QUESTIONS. SO THE FIRST ELEMENT- IN OUR PROPOSAL WOULD RECAST AND EXPAND THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE CLEARING HOUSE AS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH. WORKFORCE RESEARCH AND DATA CENTER. SO THE CAL HEALTH WORK RESEARCH AND DATA CENTER WOULD SERVE AS THE STATE'S CENTRAL HUB OF HEALTH WORKFORCE DATA. WE PROPOSE REQUIRING ALL HEALTH CARE LICENSING BOARDS TO COLLECT OF COURSE AT A FEDERALLY RECOMMENDED DATA ELEMENTS. FOR HEALTH WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND TO PROVIDE THIS DATA TO THE TOSH AT THE CLEARING HOUSE'S NEVER HAD THE DATA THAT WE NEEDED AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE SYSTEMATIZED AND HAVE A BASELINE SET OF DATA. THE RESEARCH AND DATA CENTER WOULD PROVIDE BETTER AND TIMELIER DATA ANALYSIS TO INFORM STATE POLICY REGARDING ISSUES OF WORKFORCE SHORTAGE EQUITY IN DISTRIBUTION. WHAT ALSO HELPED- WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IF THAT IS APPROVED AS WELL AS ARE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE ARE HEALTH PAYMENTS DATA PROGRAM. THE RESOURCES REQUESTED HERE WOULD ALLOW US TO PERFORM VALUABLE TESTING ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND INFORM POLICY AND PROGRAMMATIC DECISIONS. WE ALSO HAVE A PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A SINGLE STATEWIDE HEALTH CARE CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL WHICH WOULD- REPLACED THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FOUNDATION PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE SONG BROWN COMMISSION. SO I STARTED SEEKING EFFICIENCY BY OPERATING THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FOUNDATION WORKFORCE PROGRAMS DIRECTLY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- AND MAINTAINING THE LICENSING REVENUE STREAMS BUT BUT DISCONTINUING THE FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE STATUS OF THE FOUNDATION AND ALL ADDRESS THAT IN MORE DETAIL WITH QUESTION NUMBER THREE. AND THEY WERE ALSO PROPOSING TO TRANSITION FROM THE CURRENT SONG BROWN CONNECTION TO THIS NEW HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL WOULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON STATEWIDE EDUCATION AND HEALTH WORKFORCE TRAINING NEEDS ACROSS KEY AREAS INCLUDING GENERAL PHYSICIAN EDUCATION PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND WOULD ADVISE ON INCREASING THE SUPPLY AND DIVERSITY OF BOTH PHYSICIAN AND NON PHYSICIAN PROVIDERS AS WELL AS THE PLACEMENT OF PROVIDERS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA. SO WE WANT TO BE POSITIONED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO NEW RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA NEEDS- MORE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND MAKE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S OTHER WORKFORCE PROGRAMS- I WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP TEN RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION. IS TO HAVE A BODY THAT IS ALWAYS TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAMS. WE WILL CONSIDER THE COUNCIL'S POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AS IT ADMINISTERS THE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. THE CURRENT BOARD AND COMMISSION THE H. PATH FORWARD AND OUR SONG BROWN COMMISSION PROVIDE DIRECTION ON A SUBSET OF OPTIONS PROGRAMS. BUT NO ONE ENTITY IN THE STATE- IS CURRENTLY ANALYZING- ADVISING ON THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE BOTCHED ITS PROGRAMS FOR COORDINATING WITH OTHER STATE ENTITIES THAT HAVE HEALTH WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND THAT IS WHAT WE SEEK TO DO WITHIN. ACCOUNTS ALL WHILE MAINTAINING A THIS IS CRITICAL ALL OF THE PROGRAMS OVERSEEN BY THESE TWO COUNCILS BUT BY HAVING ONE UNIFIED ADVISORY BOARD INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT MORE FRACTURED APPROACH WE THINK THIS IS BETTER GOVERNMENT MORE EFFICIENT- IMPORTANT TO TAKE THAT STRATEGIC YOU. WE ALSO ARE PROPOSING TO INTEGRATE THE STATE OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH. AND THE J. ONE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM IN JOSH HAS PRIMARY CARE OFFICE. SO CONSOLIDATING THE STATE OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH WHICH IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE PRIMARY CARE OFFICE. WILL PROVIDE A CENTRALIZED IN BETTER TARGETED APPROACH TO WORKING WITH RURAL COMMUNITIES ON THEIR HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE NEEDS AND DOES SO- BY LEVERAGING OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE WOULD BE IN GOOD COMPANY FORTY OTHER STATES ALREADY COMBINED THESE FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION ASPECTS EXPERTISE- MAKES IT WELL SUITED TO ADMINISTER THE J. ONE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM WHICH ASSISTS DOCTORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND OBTAINING A J. ONE VISA. TO TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN CALIFORNIA WERE ALREADY ANALYZING WHERE WHERE THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS ARE AND WE WOULD BE WELL POISED TO SORT OUT HOW TO BEST- POSITION THOSE THOSE DOCTORS. WELL I GOT A COUPLE OF PROPOSALS TO STRENGTHEN OUR DATA PROGRAMS- SO WITH EXISTING RESOURCES USHERED PROPOSES SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CHANGES ON DATA RECORDING TO ENHANCE DATA QUALITY. IMPROVE ACCESS TO AVAILABLE DATA AND REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON DATA PROVIDERS SO SPECIFICALLY- IN TERMS OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COST TRANSPARENCY STATUTE- WELL KNOWN AS SB SEVENTEEN. WE PROPOSE TO ADD DATA POINTS THAT WOULD HELP IDENTIFY THE THERAPEUTIC TYPE OF DRUGS. FACTORS DESCRIBING THE REASON FOR A PRICE INCREASE. REASONS FOR NOT DISCLOSING INFORMATION AND CLEAR AUTHORITY FOR THE NEW DEPARTMENT TO ASSESS. REPORTING FOR COMPLETENESS. WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO UPDATE SB SEVENTEEN- TO IMPROVE DATA QUALITY COMPLETENESS BY CLARIFYING DEFINITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING AND ADDING INFORMATION TO SUPPORT COMPARISONS OF BRANDED VERSUS GENERIC DRUGS SO WE'VE BEEN- COLLECTING THAT SB SEVENTEEN DATA FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THESE ARE OBSERVATIONS ABOUT SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO STREAMLINE THAT COLLECTION PROCESS AND PROVIDE THE TRANSPARENCY THAT THE LEGISLATURE SOUGHT. WE ALSO HAVE A PROPOSAL- PERTAINING TO OUR CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT OUTCOMES ARE REPORTING TO PROVIDE US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO PERFORM OUTCOMES REPORTING FOR NEW AND EMERGING CARDIAC PROCEDURES INSTEAD OF BEING STUCK- IN TERMS OF REPORTING ON THE SAME CARDIAC PROCEDURE WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PAY THAT AS THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE WE THINK IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO A LOOK AT THE TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE. AND THEN FINALLY WE'RE PROPOSING TO UPDATE STATUTES PERTAINING TO VITAL STATISTICS TO ENSURE TIMELY EFFICIENT TRANSMISSION OF BIRTH AND DEATH DATA. IN ORDER FOR BOTH PUBLIC OR- FORTY RESEARCH- ON ISSUES SUCH AS MATERNAL QUALITY OF CARE AND INPATIENT MORTALITY. LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS IN OFFICE GROWING PORTFOLIO- WE DO FEEL IT'S TIME TO CHANGE AGAIN THE GOVERNOR'S INDICATED TIME STUFF GRADUATED HE WILL FROM AN OFFICE WITH DEPARTMENT AND WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD THE NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS INFORMATION OR H. HI WE THINK THAT BETTER REFLECTS OUR MERGING HEALTH POLICY LEADERSHIP ROLE. THE DEPARTMENT'S WORK IS CENTERED ON ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. ACCESS TO STATE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES ACCESS TO THAT CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY CARE ACCESS TO FINANCING FOR HEALTH FACILITIES. AND THE INFORMATION TO MAKE ASSESSMENTS ABOUT HEALTH OUTCOMES FACILITIES WORKFORCE AND FINANCE. SO THAT WAS MY PRESENTATION ON QUESTIONS ON NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JUST BRIEFLY CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ABOUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH REMOTE THAT IT WAS BEING DISTANT AND EVERYTHING GOT AND HOW HOW HOW IS WHAT WE LEARNED GONE INTO YOUR THINKING. ABOUT PLANNING FOR THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR I THINK THERE'S STILL A LOT OF OUR RESEARCH NEEDED INTO- THE INCREDIBLE. INCREDIBLY QUICK PAYDAY TO TELEHEALTH- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR IN PERSON OF COURSE PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO I HAD TO WORK CONTINUES TO BE TO. IDENTIFY THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS- AND TO- AND BUT BUT I THINK WE DO NEED TO LOG HELLO HEALTHCARE. IT'LL IS- IN TERMS OF PROVIDING- ACCESS TO CARE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THE PANDEMIC HAS CERTAINLY SHOWN US ABOUT WORKFORCE IS THE INCREDIBLE NEED WE HAVE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE- I THINK IT SHONE A LIGHT ON INCREASED ON THE PAIN OF RACIAL. INEQUITIES AND THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE'RE SUFFERING AN INCREDIBLE NEED WE HAVE TO REALLY GROWS UP THE STATE'S WORKFORCE- IN SO MANY AREAS- ANOTHER QUESTION PRODUCTION ANYONE FROM. THE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT UNTIL UNTIL IT HAPPENS- SOME OF THE SOME OF THE COMMISSIONS THAT YOU'RE FOR THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER SHOULD TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN ONE PLACE WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE- HAVE YOU STARTED TO BEGIN TO DO SOME OF THAT WORK SO THAT. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TURF ISSUES GOING ON AND HAS THERE BEEN A COLLABORATION AND HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND JUST THE DOW I THINK IT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW BUT IT IS BEARS BEING SAID AS I GOT ANOTHER REPORT FROM MY DISTRICT OFFICE ABOUT THE OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF EDT CASES COMING IN RIGHT AND SO WE THINK ABOUT STATE DEPARTMENTS AND WE THINK ABOUT ANOTHER STATE DEPARTMENT AND WE'RE WE'VE OT HIGH HOPES- BUT AS WE POTENTIALLY MOVE TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION. HELLO MAKING SURE THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER. AND WORKING WITH THIS LITTLE TURF ISSUES AND SILOS AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I THINK- THE MOVING ABOUT THE STATE OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH OVER TOSH AND IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE WHERE WE DIDN'T FACE ANY TURF ISSUES WE REACH OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SET FORTY EIGHT OTHER STATES DO IT THIS WAY. WE THINK WE CAN PROVIDE THE MOST EFFICIENT- CARE- TO CALIFORNIA BY BY PULLING THESE OFFICES TOGETHER AND THEY ABOLUTELY AGREED SO THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S SIMILARLY WORK TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ABOUT TRYING TO GET. BASELINE DATA FROM ALL OF THE- STATE LICENSING BOARDS UP A PROPOSAL EVERYTHING MAKES GOOD SENSE- IN TERMS OF THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND STARTING TO TRANSITION THEIR OF COURSE WE CAN OFFICIALLY DO SO. UNTIL THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS- IS AGREED UPON BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ABOUT HOW TO- HOW TO HAVE THE NEW COUNCIL TAKE THAT STRATEGIC APPROACH- AGAIN WE THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN GOOD RESEARCH AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT HAVE BEEN BEEN PUT OUT AND IT'S INCUMBENT UPON. US TO TRY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU THIRTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH- DIRECTOR FOR PRESENTATION I DID A FEW QUESTIONS- RELATED- YOUR PRESENTATION AND TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH US FIVE NOW- THIS NEW DEPARTMENT NAME IS TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD- SO FIRST OF ALL IN APPRECIATE YOUR GETTING THE DATA FROM THE VARIOUS LICENSING BOARDS I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT HOWEVER I ALSO MAKE NOTE TO SAY ACTUALLY A LICENSEE AND ALSO SOMEONE SEARCHED ON. BUSINESS PROFESSIONS THAT- VERY THE MINISTRATIONS ENTERTAINING VERY LARGE INCREASES AND LICENSING FEES FOR- PEOPLE WHO WISH TO ACTUALLY PRACTICE- SO. I GUESS FIRST QUESTIONS IS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THE COST OF COLLECTING THIS DATA AND THEN ANALYZING THIS DATA WILL THIS BE BORNE BY THE GENERAL FUND OR OTHER RESOURCES OR IS GOING TO BE BORNE BY THE LICENSEES THEMSELVES ALREADY. LOOKING AT LICENSING YOU KNOW FEE INCREASES OF NO NOT JUST A COUPLE PERCENT BUT YOU KNOW YEAH LICENSE FEE INCREASES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I WILL GIVE INITIAL ANSWER ON SATURDAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THAT I MAY DIAL A FRIEND WITH THEM DEPUTY DIRECTOR VALLIER ERICKSON- TO JUMP IN FOR ME BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO USE OUR OWN DATA FUNDS- AND I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THESE COSTS ARE COMING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS OR ANY LICENSING FEES PAID BY. LICENSEES TO THE TO THE LICENSING POINTS OUT IF I'M INCORRECT- DEBBIE BUT DIRECTOR ERICSON. PLEASE PLEASE CORRECT ME. NO GARAGE OKAY OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY YES IT MONICA SO YOU KNOW YOU ARE CORRECT- DIRECTOR LANCE BURKE SO THE ONLY THING WE HAVE ARE TWO COMPONENTS TO THIS WORK WE ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL WE HAVE AN ONGOING CONTRACT WE'RE GOING TO BE SETTING UP FOR THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE WILL BE REIMBURSING DCA FOR THEIR WORK. AND THAT I BELIEVE IS COMING OUT OF THE DATA FUND AND THEN I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PROPOSAL OF IN ADDITION TO THAT ONE TIME- EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR SYSTEM TO DEAL OUT. IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO GET THE STATE AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO THINGS THANKS REPORTER ALL RIGHT APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU- THAT SAID I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT IMPORTANCE- OF THE STATE AND I PRESUME THAT THE DATA THAT YOU'RE COLLECTING AT LEAST- THE INDIVIDUAL DATA WILL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL THAT'S NOT SUBJECT THE P. R. A. OTHER TYPES OF- EXPOSURE CORRECT. ABSOLUTELY OKAY- THE OTHER COULD NEXT QUESTION IS ACTUALLY- YOU TALKED ABOUT SENSUALLY CENTRALIZING- THE- CREATING ONE CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION TRAINING COUNCIL TO REPLACE ESSENTIALLY THE SONG BROWN COMMISSION AND- THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE FALLS COMMISSION OTHERS. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE COMPOSITION OF THIS COUNCIL BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW WHAT THE SONG BROWN COMMISSION HATS REPRESENTATIVES REPRESENTING SPECTACULAR VERY IMPORTANT SECTORS- NORTH FOR ABLE TO PROPONENTS FUNCTION RIGHT THERE'S REPRESENTATION FROM PRIMARY CARE RESIDENTS- MEDICAL SCHOOLS THAT PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AT CETERA- SO WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE COMPOSITION OF THIS CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE POLICY COMMISSION SO THAT- THERE'S AT APPROPRIATE. REPRESENTATION. AND EXPERTISE ON THIS COMMISSION. THANK YOU SENATOR AND SO ARE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WITHIN. TO HAVE THE COMMISSION- THE THOSE COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS MADE BY A COMBINATION OF THE GOVERNOR'S-OFFICE SENATE RULES THAT ASSEMBLY SO WE'VE LAID OUT AREAS OF EXPERTISE THAT WE THINK ARE CRITICAL- AS YOU KNOW IT'S ON BROWN- COMMISSION HAS A WONDERFUL PERFECT. RECOMMITTED EXPERTISE SO WE WOULD WANT TO CONTINUE TO TAP. INTO AS MANY OF THOSE FOLKS WHO- MEET MEET THE COMMISSION NEEDS THAT WOULD WHICH IS GOING TO BE BROADER SO IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON PRIMARY CARE ALSO LOOKING AT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ALLIED PROFESSIONS- I-THE MASCARA REYES ALL TO JUMP AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE INDICATED. A COUPLE OF SPECIFICS ABOUT THE POSITION KERRY CAN HELP US WITH THAT HE'S- I'M SURE. HI I AM KAREN REYES- ACTOR HEALTHCARE WORK FIRST ON THE DIVISION ASHRIDGE AND- AS AS- DURECT ANNOUNCED BURKE SAID- SCOPE IS WE'RE LOOKING TO. LOOK AT EXPERTISE IN OUR FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH GRANTED GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION WITH TRAINING PROGRAMS WITH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATION FOR EXAMPLE- AND THEN THE OTHER STATE OFFICES AS WELL THAT ENGAGING HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ON UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. SYSTEM X. CETERA. OKAY SO THE SPECIFICS ARE NON- ANALYSES AT THIS POINT- BUT- PERHAPS YOU CAN PROVIDE THEM THAT MIGHT BE SOME SUBJECTIVE SOME DISCUSSION DEPENDING ON. EXACTLY WHAT THE DETAILS ARE SO APPRECIATE THAT THE AT THE OTHER ISSUE THAT ACTUALLY ONE TOUCH ON SO YOU KNOW PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED- PRIMARILY. LOOKED AT SENSUALLY THE PIPELINE ITSELF RIGHT SO WE HAVE SOME GROUND WE HAVE OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS AS WELL AND I KNOW LATER WE'RE GONNA BE TOUCHING ON- AND YOU'RE ALSO GONNA BE DOING A LOT OF DATA COLLECTION- AND THEN- THERE'S YOU KNOW SOME DISCUSSION AFFORDABILITY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING ON LATER AND I BELIEVE THIS OFFICE WAS. IT'S GOING TO BE IN THIS. AND IN YOUR VIEW OF WHAT'S NO LONGER IN OFFICE ANYMORE DEPARTMENT- HOWEVER IS IT IS WELL AS FODDER FOR THAT THE SUCCESSOR LARGE FINES DEPARTMENT GOING TO DO TO LABOR- ANALYSES. REGARDING V. AROUND THE WORK FORCE SO I MEAN I DO WORKFORCE RES I DID WORKFORCE RESEARCH BEFORE I CAME TO LEGISLATORS I THINK A LITTLE EXPERTISE NOT SOMETIMES WE COME TO WORK FORCE PEOPLE FOCUS. ON THE PIPELINE BUT ALSO POINT OUT. THAT YOU CAN TRY TO. THE TO TRY AND- BUT THERE ISN'T A MARKET FOR THEM THE PAY ISN'T APPROPRIATE- WORK. THE THE POSITIONS AREN'T THERE SO ONCE CAPPED OFF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE TO HIRE- AND SO FORTH THEN YOU CAN TRY TO PUSH ALL THE PEOPLE YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET INTO THE PIPELINE BUT- THEY'RE NOT GOING INTO THE PIPELINE OR TO COME OUT THE PIPELINE DOING UNTIL THE ONE ELSE DON'T ENTER. BECAUSE THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AREN'T THERE- TO PAY THE BENEFITS THE WORKING CONDITIONS AT CETERA. SO ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE NOW THIS NEW DEPARTMENT OF ACCESS AND INFORMATION YOU HAVE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GIVING YOU ACCESS A LOT OF INFORMATION CAN DO LABOR ECONOMIC ANALYSES- IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE- THE WORKING. CONDITIONS YOU KNOW THE PAY AND SO FORTH AT HAND HOW COMPETITIVE WE ARE AND BECAUSE AFTER ALL MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY SKILLED SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA THEY CAN GO MOVED TO OTHER STATES. IF WE DON'T CREATE THE RIGHT KIND OF MARKET FOR THEM. SO SILVA SAMPLE LET'S LOOK AT THE- TALK ABOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RIGHT. ARE WE ARE WE COMPETITIVE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OR ANOTHER AREA THAT ACTUALLY I KNOW THAT WERE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGED. IS THIS WITH AN AGING POPULATION WITH A MASTER PLAN AGING BUT WE HAVE A REAL CHALLENGE RECRUITING PEOPLE TO WORK AND- OUR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES RIGHT- AND SOME OF THAT MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT. WE HAVEN'T INCREASED US TECHNICALLY REIMBURSEMENT FOR LONG TERM CARE FACILITY SO HE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASED PAY. SO ARE WE GONNA BE LOOKING IS THIS NEW DEPARTMENT CAN BE LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES. IF YOU'RE. PART OF YOUR MISSION IS LOOKING AT WORKFORCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CALL. AND PANEL YES I. WE DO. WILL PRETTY HOMELESS. AT THOSE. AND DEMAND I'M HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DATA. SO WE HAVE CALLED OUT HERE. PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE DATA FROM LICENSING BOARDS. THAT WOULD INCLUDE- YOU KNOW RETIREMENT PLANS- SOME. MEASURES OF SATISFACTION AS WELL AS THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA THAT WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL. ALSO TO WORK WITH- ET DE. AND THE UNIVERSITIES TO GET DATA FROM THEM- I. HAVEN'T CONSIDERED A LOT OF NEEDING TO LOOK AT- FACTORS SUCH AS PAPER OF COURSE THAT IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF FOR FINDING THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT. COMING INTO THE PROFESSION BECAUSE OF THAT SO I APPRECIATE YOU FLAG NAPPIES. AND THEN I GUESS THE FOLLOW UP TO THAT IS I APPRECIATE EVEN DO THIS ANALYSIS BY HOPE THOSE WILL ALSO BE. REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE AND PERHAPS YOU CAN SPEAK TO WHAT YOU THINK THE REPORTING RELATIONSHIP. SHOULD BE ON THESE THINGS TO THE LEGISLATURE. YES WE- THE PURPOSE OF THAT OF THE DATA CENTER WOULD BE TO MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE THE DATA OFF BROADLY AVAILABLE- WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM OUR STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS THAT FOLKS. WANT US NOT TO BE A CONVENER AND TO MAKE THOSE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS- TO THE LEGISLATURE SO YES WE WILL BE. BE ISSUING PUBLIC UP. ISSUE A PUBLIC REPORTS INCLUDING TO THE LEGISLATURE OKAY WELL I THINK THAT NOT JUST POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK WE WERE THE ONES WHO ALSO HELPED SHAPE POLICY BUT THE DATA ITSELF THAT IMPLIES IT IS GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT. OKAY ALL RIGHT. WELL CERTAINLY WE CAN SPEND A LOT MORE TIME TALKING ABOUT ALL THE VARIETY THINGS ARE DOING BUT- AT LEAST THIS IS FOR STARTIN AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ANSWERS AND I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP ON. ON ON SOME OF THIS WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR IN JUST A ONE MORE QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON AS- WITH DOCTOR PRANCE QUESTION ABOUT OUR OUR- OUR SENIOR GROWING SENIOR POPULATION AND THE NEED TO GROW SENIOR WORKFORCE. WE ALSO LOOK AT AT AT PROFESSIONS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY CERTIFICATE OR LICENSE OR. AND HOW YOU HOW WE GO ABOUT. I COULDN'T MAKING A DRIVE TO HAVE MORE OF A OF THOSE CA KINDS OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO A COUPLE OF PIECES THAT ONE IS THERE IS A SEPARATE PROPOSAL- AROUND THE GERIATRICS WORKFORCE IN PARTICULAR- AND WE'VE DONE SOME GOOD LEARNING ABOUT THE DEEDS THEY'RE OPPOSED TO HELP. EDUCATE THE CURRENT PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE TO GET GERIATRIC. RATING AS WELL AS TO TRAIN SPECIALIZED GERIATRICIANS I YES WE DEFINITELY ARE LOOKING AT THE FALL SO THE FOR THE FULL- PANOPLY OF TYPES OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. INCLUDING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS- AND ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DOCTORS AND PSYCHIATRISTS. OKAY AND WILL WILL DISPUTE APARTMENT ALSO BE LOOKING AT THINGS POTENTIALLY LIKE. TITLE PROTECTION. I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOUR TOTAL PROTECTION PARDON ME SORRY TO IT'S A PET PEEVE BUT TO GET A TO BE OF A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PERSON TO GET IN. MSW AN LCSW- IN MOST OF OUR OUR- CLASSIFICATIONS IN THE STATE- YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE A DEGREE IN YOU MAY BE CALLED THE SOCIAL WORKER. SO SOME OF US WHO WHO SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING SEN- IS SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE IT DOESN'T HAVE QUITE AS MUCH VALUE IF THERE ARE OTHERS WHO CALL THEMSELVES THE SAME THING. WITHOUT THE SAME QUALIFICATIONS IF YOU WILL. SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU LOOK AT ANYTHING LIKE THAT LIKE KIND OF PROTECTIONS AS THEY RELATE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF LEGISLATION TO A LEGISLATION. AROUND THAT AROUND SCOPE AND KIND OF PROTECTION SO WILL THIS OFFICE TO BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT- WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT IT WASN'T- ASSEMBLY WE HAD HAD IT JUST FADED DOING BUT IT. WENT ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ACCORDING. RIGHT TO MOVE ON. THANK YOU SEE THAT THREE THIS YES OKAY SO IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSED DATA CENTER- THE DATA CENTER REVIEWS DATA FROM. DEALING ARE ARTS LICENSING BOARDS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SUPPLY GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND DIVERSITY OF THE HEALTH WORKFORCE. THE CENTER WOULD USE THESE DATA AND PARTS WHEN FARM PROGRAM POLICY DECISIONS REGARDING THE STATE'S HEALTH WORKFORCE. THE CENTER WOULD ALSO USE LICENSURE DATA AS AN INPUT TO CREATE PUBLIC FACING DASHBOARDS MAPS AND REPORTS WHICH WOULD INFORM STAKEHOLDERS ON THE SUPPLY AT THE STATE'S HEALTH WORKFORCE. WE WOULD ALSO USE THIS DATA TO PREPARE REPORTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL HELP INFORM POLICY DIRECTION AND DECISIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING. BOB UTILIZES VITAL STATISTICS BIRTH AND HEALTH DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO SUPPORT ALBUMS REPORTING FOR PATIENT MORTALITY MATERNAL. POLITY AND THE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES REPORTING PROGRAM AS WELL AS TO ASSIST WITH DATA LEAKAGE THE VITAL STATISTICS DATA WILL ALSO BE USED BY THE HEALTHCARE PAYMENTS DATA PROGRAM TO SUPPORT ANALYSIS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COST QUALITY AND PATIENT OUTCOMES. ALL SUPPORT DEFICIENCIES TO ADVANCE ONGOING POPULATION HEALTH RESEARCH AND DATA USE. CREAM CDPH JOSH PARRIS. ALSO SET OF HEALTHCARE INFORMATION ESSENTIALLY MANAGED AS PART OF THE OSHER ENTERPRISE DATA WAREHOUSE WHERE WE HAVE STRICT SECURITY ACCESS ENCRYPTION AND OTHER CONTROLS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE DATA HOLY AUTHORIZE JOSH HAS STAFF HAS ACCESS TO THE DATA AND TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL CONFIDENTIALITY WE AGGREGATE AND DE IDENTIFY ANY PUBLIC REPORTING A RECORD LEVEL DATA. THESE PROCEDURES ARE OVERSEEN BY OPTIONS CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER AND PRIVACY OFFICER IN A FORCED TO BUY WITH ALL STATE FEDERAL AND OTHER APPLICABLES LAWS. I'M GOOD ACTUALLY GET NOTHING THANK YOU AND I AND I THINK THAT ALSO COVERED ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS I PREVIOUSLY ASKED- THIS IS YOUR LOOKING AT THE LICENSING DATA I AM I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- S. I GUESS ONE OF THINGS HOPEFULLY YOU'RE pWELL LOT THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIONS WERE LICENSE PLATE STATE CALIFORNIA WHO ACTUALLY DON'T LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY MIGHT BE NEWLY DONE SO WE NEED TO YEAH SO THE NUMBER OF LICENSES ISSUED ITSELF OBVIOUSLY- DOESN'T REFLECT THE WORK FORCE AND THEN. THE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE ACTUALLY DON'T SPEND A LOT MAY SPEND A FRACTION OF TIME CLINICAL CARE SELVES AGAIN BE SURE ONLY COLLECT THE DATA. THAT WE'RE NOT FALSELY- XP. THE ABOUT OF CLINICAL. NO WE HAVEN'T IS A LOT DIFFERENT FACTORS AFFECTED I GUESS I WOULD FALL UNDER THAT PERCENTAGE OF PHYSICIANS- THE ACTUALLY I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S ABOUT 22% OF POSITIONS. SPEND LESS THAN HALF TWENTY TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK PROVIDING CLINICAL CARE. I GUESS I WOULD. FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY AS WELL AS A S. AS IN MY WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT- AGAIN THINKING ABOUT THAT AND THEN. MAKING NOTE THAT- I THINK A THIRD OF ALL PHYSICIANS ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY SO DEPENDING ON WHEN THEY PLAN TO RETIRE IF WE COULD LOSE A BUNCH. THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FROM THE LICENSING- BOARDS. YEAH YES ABSOLUTELY SENATORS SO WE WOULD COLLECT ON DATE OF BIRTH SO WE WOULD HAVE THE AGE WE WOULD COLLECT- THE AREAS WHERE THEY'RE PRACTICING- SO. SO ZIP CODE AND ACTUAL CLINICS WHERE THEY'RE PRACTICING AND THERE IS A BREAK DOWN- IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONS THAT FOLKS ARE ARE PERFORMING CLINICAL VERSUS ADMINISTRATOR VERSES. THE WORK OUTSIDE OF THE PROFESSION. OKAY AND I WOULD NAY NOTICED SOMEONE AGAIN HIS LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE YEAH THEY DID USE THE LEAST BUT MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA DOES. DO SOME SURVEYS BUT- I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH VERIFICATION THEY'RE DOING I'M NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE WITH FALSE. RIGHT YEAH SOMETIMES YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET YOUR LICENSE RENEWED SO YOU MAKE SOME GUESSES AND YOU. PLUG THAT IN JUST A YOU CAN GET THROUGH YOUR LICENSING APPLICATION. SO YOU MAY NEED TO DO SOME DATA CLEANING ARE CROSS CHECKING MORE IN DEPTH TO BE SURE. THAT AGAIN I DON'T THINK PEOPLE DOING IT TO BE DISHONEST I THINK JUST THAT IF YOU'RE RE LICENSING YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET YOUR LICENSE TIME. YOU KNOW THAT NIGHT OF THE FOR THE DEADLINE GETS AND TO HIT SUBMIT BEFORE- VERSES THAT YOU KNOW THINKING DEEPLY ABOUT- I DID A LOG OF HOW MUCH TIME I SPEND DOING ALL MY DIFFERENT. THINGS OVER A WEEK. I WILL TELL AND. OKAY SO YOU M. IS THAT IF THE SHOULD MOVE ON ISSUE FOUR. OKAY SO IF NUMBER ASK ABOUT THE- FOR THIS. OF FOUNDATION- SO JUST OVER BIT OF BACK THAT HELPED HER. EDUCATION FOUNDATION WITH ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TO PROVIDE A CLEAR WAY FOR PRIVATE TAX DEDUCTIBLE DONATIONS THE SUPPORT SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOAN REPAYMENT AWARDS FOR EXPIRING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AS IT TURNS OF UNNECESSARY FOR STATE PROGRAMS TO BE UNDER A FIVE ONE THREE THREE TO PROVIDE THE TAXES AND TREATMENT DONATE. AND BECAUSE OF THE FIVE ONCE THREES. THE ACCOUNT AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS OF EACH HAVE BEEN COSTLY AND BURDENSOME. WE JUST DON'T THINK IT MAKES THAT FASTBALL SENSE TO HAVE A SEPARATE NONPROFIT. ENTITY BY ALL OF THOSE. FEDERAL STATE WILL WORK. SUCH AS IN ANY PLAN OUT OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT. THIS CALL RESOURCE REQUIRE TO. THE AND FINANCIAL AUDIT. TAKE AWAY FROM THE FUNDING OF. FOR ALLEGED. APPLE THAT WOULD SOMEDAY JUST DOESN'T SEEM THERE'S A IN THE HAVE A- FRONT PAGE. FIND OUT THESE. WE THINK IT MAKES THE FASTBALL TO THE- DAHLE ALL FORTY. RIGHT THAN OVER ACTIVE. BE A PREPARATION FORCE PROGRAM. SUCH AS STEVEN HOW TOM'S. MARIEHAMN PROBE ARE. GREAT CRITICALLY. AND WITH. AS THEY CAN NOW IT WAS AS PART OF OUR- SENATE HEALTH. WORKFORCE PRO. AND WE THINK THAT INTEGRATE THE FROM AND OVER. PROGRAM PART. WOULD ALLOW APPLE TO HAVE A COMPANY YOUR ALL THE PRO. AND WOULD ALLOW OUR EFFECTIVE AND IF CAL THAT'S NOT. ACROSS PORTFOLIO. THANK YOU. NUMBER. FIVE THE HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL ROLE WOULD BE TO ADVISE ON THE DIRECTION OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH WORKFORCE TRAINING FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND NATIONAL WORK FORCE PROGRAMS THE COUNCIL ROLE WOULD BE GREATLY EXPANDED FROM THE COMMISSION VOLTS RECOMMEND THE BEST USE CASH THAT WORKFORCE FUNDS INCLUDING SONGS BROWN. TO PREPARE THE STATE FOR ITS FUTURE NEEDS. BY THE COUNCIL PRO. HEALTH WORKFORCE. AND COORDINATING THE STATE'S EFFORTS NOT JUST WITH GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION FUNDING FOR PHYSICIANS BUT ALSO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS. SO RATHER THAN HAVING THE COUNCIL TO THE ACTUAL REVIEW OF AWARDS OF APPLICATIONS AND AWARDS IT WOULD RECOMMEND HOW TO TARGET THE FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH HEALTH PROFESSIONS OR PROGRAMS WHERE YOU. NEEDS THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM WOULD CONTINUE AS IT IS WITHIN AUSTIN HAS- COLLECTING APPLICATIONS SUPPORTING PROGRAMS AND MAKING FUNDING DECISIONS. ANY FUTURE CHANGES IN APPLICATION CRITERIA WOULD INVOLVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC. OSCAR SHARE OUR OF BROWN OTHER WORKFORCE PROGRAMS WITH THE COUNCIL GAVE THEM DEVELOPING STATEWIDE HEALTH WORKFORCE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS IS A BACK TO SAID EUROPEAN SPECIALLY EARLIER SO THE CURRENT STATUTE FOR THE COMMISSION CALLS FOR A VARIETY OF MEMBERS INVOLVED KEEP GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. NURSING POSITIONS ASSISTANT AND NURSE PRACTITIONER TRAINING AND ARE PRACTICING CLINICIANS ALONG WITH PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVES SO THE INTENT OF THE COUNCIL IS TO BROADEN AND DIVERSIFY THE MEMBERSHIP. TO INCLUDE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION HEALTH WORKFORCE TRAINING AND HEALTH DELIVERY. THAT WERE ENVISIONING THAT WOULD INCLUDE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM DIRECTORS REPRESENTATIVES OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TRAINING PROGRAMS REPRESENTATIVES OF ADVANCED. ALLIED HEALTH TRAINING PROGRAMS. REPUBLICAN PRICE HEALTH DELIVERY ALREADY. AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT ENGAGE IN HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE H. YES- AND THE UC AND CSU SYSTEMS. OUR COMPOSITION OF COUNCIL MEMBERS WOULD ENABLE ASHTEAD TO TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR DEVELOPING HEALTH WORK FIRST WORKFORCE PRIORITIES AND ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY IN MATCHING COUNCIL COMPOSITION WITH THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THE STATE. I GUESS THE FIRST THING I WOULD ASK IS TO MAKE SURE. WE ALL ALSO HAVING STATEWIDE REGIONAL REPRESENTATION AS WE LOOK AT THE DIVERSITY AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEW BOARD. YEAH IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT- MADAM CHAIR AND SO WE WENT WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY IN IN MAKING THE APPOINTMENTS- TO ADVISE ON ON REGIONAL DIVERSITY BUT HE AGREED THAT VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS. OKAY OKAY I THINK WE'RE GOOD. SHOWING THE ONE DOLLAR HEALTH CARE FERTILITY. OUR TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND L. A. L. OF COURSE. DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO COMMENTS THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU FOR OIL. HI COREY THIS YEAR WITH THE L. A- JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL I'LL BE VERY FAST- YOU KNOW IN THIS PROPOSAL WE JUST KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR. CONCERNS TO RAISE YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT THE GOALS OF ESTABLISHING THIS NEW DEPARTMENT WHICH ARE YOU KNOW GENERALLY TO ESTABLISH A DEPARTMENT WITH A STRONGER CAPACITY FOR BOTH RESEARCH AND EVALUATION OF. YOU KNOW STATE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE ISSUES AND AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS MAKES SENSE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE ADDITION OF THE OFFICE AFFORDABILITY. YOU KNOW FURTHERMORE YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT THIS OFFICE DOES ACTUALLY PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION MORE ACCOUNTABLE ON ISSUES RELATED TO HEALTH CARE ACCESS YOU KNOW AFFORDABILITY AND ON THE COLLECTION OF HEALTH INFORMATION YOU KNOW THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE FOR OUR WORKFORCE RELATED ISSUES. YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH WHICH ALSO WORK ON THESE ISSUES- YOU KNOW WHICH INDICATE THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULDN'T FULLY CONSOLIDATE THIS RESPONSIBILITY INTO ONE DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW WITH THIS RECASTING THE NEW DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW WOULD PRESENT ITSELF AS A CENTRAL POINT OF CONTACT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THESE ISSUES- WHICH MAY HELP FACILITY FACILITATES ACCOUNTABILITY. I'M TO THE LEGISLATURE ESPECIALLY IN RECEIVING EVALUATION MATERIALS OUT OF WORKFORCE IN AFFORDABILITY ISSUES THAT THE DEPARTMENT. THE NEW DEPARTMENT WOULD COLLECT INFORMATION ON. SO THAT THAT'S ALL INCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY- AND I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BILL KRAMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE HEALTH POLICY PURCHASER BUSINESS GROUP RYAN WHICH LARA AND NOLAN HI CHECK. ED TANISHQ- THE LOCAL A JENNIFER MILEY AND JASMINE PALLID. THE CREAMERY THERE TO START US OFF. YES I AM HE AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED TOPS OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. I'M BILL KRAMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH POLICY AT THE PURCHASER BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH. FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE PACIFIC BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH. WE ARE NOT FOR PROFIT COALITION BASE IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING NEARLY FORTY LARGE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS AND PUBLIC ENTITIES. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSED COSTS OF HEALTH CARE FOR ABILITY. AS ALL OF YOU KNOW. WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH. CREATING FINANCIAL BARRIERS FOR PATIENTS TO GET NECESSARY CARE. HI COSTS ALSO PUT A SEVERE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND FAMILIES. THAT'S CRIED CROWDING OUT BUSINESS INVESTMENT JOB GROWTH AND WORKERS WAGES THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT HEALTHCARE IT'S ABOUT THE ECONOMY JOBS AND WAGES. WE KNOW THE HEALTHCARE COSTS COULD BE LOWER MUCH LOWER WHILE MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF CARE AND ACCESS TO NEEDED CARE. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE AMOUNT OF UNNECESSARY SPENDING. IS NEARLY 2230% WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN GROUPS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICESAT MUCH LOWER COST THAN OTHER PROVIDERS. IT ALSO HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY PRESENTS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THE COST OF CARE ARE REASONABLE AND AFFORDABLE. AND THERE MIGHT BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS OTHER STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED OR PROPOSED SIMILAR OFFICER COMMISSIONS. AND THE PROPOSED DESIGN OF CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY BUILDS ON THEIR EXPERIENCE. IT MIKE'S OPINION THE CALIFORNIA MODEL IS LIKELY TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN PARTICULAR WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WILL BE AFFECTED BECAUSE- IT SCOPE IS BROAD. IT'S TAKING INTO ACCOUNT QUALITY ACCESS AND EQUITY NOT JUST COSTS. SECOND WE WILL SAID APPROPRIATE TARGETS WITH MEANINGFUL INCENTIVES FOR MEETING THE TARGETS. AND THIRTY WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDERS FOR HELP IN MEETING THE TARGETS. THERE'S ONE ELEMENT OF THE BILL I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED. OF THE ROLE THE ADVISORY BOARD IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SUCCESS ON THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S MEMBERS ARE ACTING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SPECIFICALLY THE BOARD SHOULD ENSURE THE INTERESTS OF PATIENTS CONSUMERS AND PURCHASERS THOSE WHO RECEIVE HEALTH SERVICES AND PAY FOR THEM. OUR PROPERTY REPRESENTATIVE. I RECOMMEND THAT WE FIND WAYS TO ENSURE A DEVICE REPORT IS ACTING ON BEHALF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST PROJECT. IN SUMMARY CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING A SEVERE CRISIS OF HEALTHCARE COSTS WALDIE ACCESS AND EQUITY. I BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED TOPS OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY REPRESENTS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS. THANK YOU FOR ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AFTER THE PANEL SPEAKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. M. THIS SHOULD I INVESTED THAT DIZZY MINISTRATION WANNA SPEAK FIRST OR JUST WANT TO GO OVER TO THE PANELISTS. OR WHATEVER WHATEVER MANAGER FOR PRINCES WERE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CHANGES WHATEVER IN WHATEVER ORDER YOU PREFER. ANOTHER WE STARTED WHEN WE HEAR FIRST AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL CLOSE WITH YOU HOW'S THAT OKAY OKAY. ALL RIGHT THAT RAIN WHICH PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RYAN WHAT'S NICE SERVICE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. CJ APPRECIATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IS IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING CALIFORNIA. DRESSING THIS PROBLEM IS NO EASY TASK AND WHILE OFFICE OF HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY AS OUTLINED. BY A YOUTH IN AB ELEVEN THIRTY AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRAILER BILL ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR CURBING THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE CRITICAL CHANGES NEEDED. AT THIS PROPOSALS TO BE BOTH SUCCESSFUL AND SUSTAINABLE OUTLINED IN TODAY'S GENDER ARE THREE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR CJ. AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT DURING THESE REMARKS. AND ALSO TAKE QUESTIONS WHEN APPROPRIATE. FIRST I SUPPOSE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE COULD BE DETRIMENTAL AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL SUGGESTS THAT THE HEALTHCARE SPENDING TODAY. IS IN THE RIGHT AMOUNTS IN IS IN THE RIGHT PLACES. AS MANY KNOWLEDGE CODE NINETEEN HAS SHOWN THAT CURRENT SPENDING ON BEHAVIOR HEALTH IS INSUFFICIENT FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. IN FACT THIS IS ALSO THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION AS WE'VE SEEN THEIR BUDGET PROPOSAL. TO INVEST MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND. STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. UNDER THE SUPER BOWL THESE TYPES OF INVEST WOULD OWN BE IMPLEMENTED IF OTHER SPENDING IS REDUCED FORCING A CHOICE BETWEEN NEW BENEFICIAL SPENDING AND CUTS TO EXISTING SERVICES. SECOND WE WERE ASKED TO CONSIDER OTHER MODELS WELL WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR WELL INTENTIONED POLICY LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES UNDER THE MEDICARE'S NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN SUSTAINABLE GROWTH RATE POLICY S. YOUR POLICY. AND EVEN THOUGH THE S. G. R. WAS DESIGNED TO CONTROL COSTS GROWTH MEDICARE PAYMENTS FOR POSITIONS IN HOWEVER FAILED. TO ADDICT ACCURATELY ADDRESSED THE INPUT COSTS CHANGES IN A ROLE WITHIN INCREASED SPENDING DUE TO NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SZOLD AFTER SEVENTEEN YEARS OF SHORT TERM CONGRESSIONAL FIXES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA- CONGRESS ABANDON THE FLOOD POLICY BECAUSE OF TOO MUCH INSTABILITY FOR DOCTORS. THIS LEADS TO THE FINAL QUESTION ARE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSIONS TODAY WITH DOCTOR WITHIN HIS TEAM AS WELL AS THIS ADMINISTRATION ARE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FALL INTO FOUR MAIN AREAS FIRST THE OFFICE DOES NOT TREAT ALL HEALTHCARE ENTITIES EQUITABLY. SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDERS AND PAYERS OUR AMENDMENTS EQUALIZED THESE AT THE TREATMENT OF PAYERS AND PROVIDERS TO ENSURE CONSUMERS AND PURCHASERS REALIZED THE BENEFITS. EVERY SECTOR SHOULD MEET THE SAME STANDARDS TO BE IN THE SAME BOAT ALL RUNNING TOGETHER. SECOND HEALTHCARE ENTITIES NEEDED. AND STABLE PATHWAY TO CHANGE CHANGE CANNOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION SHOULDN'T JEOPARDIZE ACCESS TO OR THE QUALITY CARE. THIRD THE OFFICE SHOULD MINIMIZE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND PREVENT PERVERSE INCENTIVES AS AN EXAMPLE. ARE IN THE OFFICE TO ESTABLISH SECTOR BASED TARGETS INCENTIVIZE COST SHIFTING BETWEEN SECTORS INSTEAD THE OFFICE SHOULD FOCUS ON PROMOTING COLLABORATION NOT SOLIDIFYING SILOS. AND FINALLY THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES TO INSTILL CONFIDENCE AND BUY IN FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS ARE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FOCUS ON ADDING AN APPEALS PROCESS GREATER TRANSPARENCY ENSURING A MORE BALANCED PERSPECTIVE WITH THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WE THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME AND REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BLUESHIELD. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS MARLON PAYCHECK AND I'M A SENIOR- AND SENIOR MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS TEAM WE FEEL THAT CALIFORNIA IS A NONPROFIT HEALTH PLAN GUIDED BY ITS MISSION TO REIMAGINE HEALTH. INTO A SYSTEM THAT IS WORTHY OF OUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHILE BLUESHIELD REPRESENTS FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS IN THE STATE OF FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS WE HAVE A GOAL AND ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AT AN AFFORDABLE RATE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS WE'VE COLLABORATED WITH PROVIDERS BUSINESS LABOR GROUPS AND CONSUMER GROUPS TO CREATE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN CONTAINING COSTS AND ALL THAT ALSO BRING HEALTHCARE IN THE DIGITAL AGE THIS CAN BE DONE BY LEVERAGING- CALL PATIENT CHARACTER HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. AS ENVISIONED IN AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER ONE AND HERE THIS COST CONTAINMENT PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU WHICH WE SUPPORT AND WE THINK IT TAKES CONCRETE STRESSED THAT IN A DRAFTING RISING HEALTH COSTS IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T THINK- THAT HEALTH COSTS ARE UNSUSTAINABLE HEARING THE STATE AND NOT HELICOPTER OUTSTRIPPING WAGE GROWTH- IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL CONTROVERSY COUNTABLE IN THE STATE. PROGRAMS REPRESENT- 20% OF PREMIUM. ARE TO FEDERAL AND STATE OVERSIGHT- MULTIPLE A OR- AND GREAT REVIEW WHEN IT TO COST. THE OTHER. 80% OF THE- OF COSTS HAVE THE SAME TREND. OR REVIEW PROCESS. MS OUR REFLECTION OF COST TO THE SYSTEM WHETHER THAT BROWN INSURERS HOSPITALS PROVIDERS OR DRUG PRICES. GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT INTO THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE UNDER THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY ABOUT PORTABILITY NEED COST SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS WHETHER THAT BE A REDUCTION IN PREMIUM OR SLOWER RATE INCREASES- THE LONG ANY APPLE WE HAVE AND THIS IS FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. CENTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR VERSION OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY THEY HAVE SEEN IT HEALTHCARE SPENDING ANNUAL GROWTH RATE DECLINE FROM AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION THE FOURTH LOWEST GENERATING UP TO SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION AND AVOIDED COMMERCIAL SPENDING BETWEEN. TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHT P. HELLO YES. PLANS WILL DE BE SUBJECT TO OF. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- BANK HOWEVER UNDER THE FRAMEWORK OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY ALL CREDIT COST DRIVERS WILL BE UNDER GOD OVERSIGHT AND GREATER TRANSPARENCY WHICH WE THINK REALLY WILL LEAD TO LOWER COSTS IN THE SYSTEM. ULTIMATELY THIS PROPOSAL IS CREATING A PUBLIC PLATFORM TO REALLY LOOK AT **** TRENDS DRIVERS OF THOSE TRENDS AND STRATEGIES TO BRING THOSE TRENDS DOWN. AND WE THINK THAT THAT TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT AND PUBLIC PLATFORM WELL REALLY PROMOTE CHANGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND HELP US PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE AT AT THE SENIOR BOWL RATE- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JANICE WAS CMA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JANICE RONCO VICE PRESIDENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND COVERAGE ON BEHALF OF THE NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AT SEEM IS SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO CURB COSTS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM INCREASED COMPETITION REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY IS AN INCREASE CARE COORDINATION WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AND HAVE ASKED FOR AMENDMENTS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. FIRST THE DEFINITION OF PROVIDER IN THE PROPOSAL IS OVERLY BROAD IT WOULD INCLUDE ALL PHYSICIAN PRACTICES. WE'VE ASKED FOR AMENDMENTS TO NARROW THE DEFINITION OF PROVIDER IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON THE REAL COST RIGHT FIRST AND TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON PHYSICIAN PRACTICES. THERE ARE VARIOUS ECONOMIC STUDIES THAT INDICATE THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS OF CALIFORNIA ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY THE CONSOLIDATED HEALTH CARE MARKET IN WHICH HEALTH INSURER THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. AND AS SUCH AS A COSTS BETTER AND MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THE HOSPITAL MARKET IS CONSIDERED HIGHLY CONCENTRATE ON ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION GUIDELINES ACROSS TARGETS THAT APPLY TO ALL PHYSICIAN PRACTICES ARE OVERLY BURDENSOME ON ENTITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE MARKET POWER TO SET PROVIDER RATES. AND THEY'RE INCONSISTENT WITH HOW OTHER STATES HAVE HANDLED SIMILAR EFFORTS. AT TUESDAY'S WERE RELEASED TODAY THAT SHOW THAT WHEN HOSPITALS ACQUIRE IS SURE PRACTICES COSTS INCREASED. AND DONE INCORRECTLY A PROPOSAL IN THIS VEIN- COULD LEAD TO MORE SITUATIONS OF. SMALLER PRACTICES BEING GOBBLED UP BY OTHERS. I'M ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WHEN COST CONTAINMENT IS THE SOLE FOCUS WHEN YOU'RE SENDING THE COST TARGETS WHEN QUALITY- AND ACCESS ARE ACTUALLY A PART OF THE TARGET SETTING AS- AS A IN THE BILL CURRENTLY- THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE A SEPARATE- PART OF THE BILL WHERE THEY'RE- PART OF A REPORT. FOR THE COST ANY- YOU CAN INADVERTENTLY HARM QUALITY AND ACCESS A CMA SUPPORTERS. MANAKALA EXPANSION TO FOR INSTANCE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATIONS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SHORT TERM INCREASE COSTS OF PROVIDING CARE. TO THOSE WHO LACK ACCESS. TO HEALTH CARE- AND NO FROM SHOULD BE. FOR SERVING A NEW INSURED. WE ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OLD PRIZE HERE. TAKES INTO ACCOUNT QUALITY EQUITY AND ACCESS. THEM I ALSO BELIEVES THAT WHO MAKES THE DECISION ABOUT THE COST TARGET MATTERS WE SUPPORT PUTTING THIS CRITICAL DECISION IN THE HANDS OF A STATEWIDE ELECTED OFFICIAL WHETHER THAT BE THE GOVERNOR OR THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. EXPERIENCE TELLS US THAT HAVING ONE APPOINTEE WHO'S NOT DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE. TO THE VOTERS IS NOT THE IDEAL WAY TO GO UNDER PRIOR ADMINISTRATION THAT WAS LESS FOCUSED ON HEALTH CARE THAN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION WE SAW FIRST WITH HEALTH INSURANCE RATE REVIEW. THAT THE ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WHO HAD FAR FEWER COVERED LIVES IN THE POLICIES THAT HE REGULATED THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE WAS ABLE TO SAVE CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES FAR MORE MONEY IN PREMIUM SAVINGS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE. WE SAW IT AGAIN WITH HEALTH INSURANCE MERGER APPROVALS WHERE THE ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WORKED WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND MOST SUCCESSFUL AT PREVENTING MERGERS. THAT WOULD INCREASE HEALTH CARE COSTS IN CALIFORNIA WHILE THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE EITHER APPROVED THE MERGERS- OR TOOK NO POSITION ON THEM. THOSE ARE JUST ALTERNATELY BLOCKED BY COURTS CONSISTENT WITH WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WAS ARGUING FOR. THE SYSTEM WE BUILD HERE NEEDS TO LAST BEYOND THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION- THERE ARE ALSO SOME TIMING ISSUES AND WE THINK THAT THE APC APC THE NEEDS TO BE UP AND RUNNING BEFORE THE STATE. WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO FINALIZE- WHAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDER. CONSIDERING AND SETTING THE COST TARGETS A CMA LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE DEMONSTRATION AND STAKEHOLDERS TO BUILD SOLUTIONS THAT WILL DRIVE COSTS DOWN FOR CONSUMERS THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR VOCAL- OKAY WE'LL MOVE ON WITH THAT DENNIS O'MALLEY. PLEASE WITH THE LABOR FOR IT. SORRY ABOUT THAT. WORKING ON THE NEW BUTTON HELLO CARE EGGMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER MALLEY AND I AM THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TOWARDS ISSUE THROUGH THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. THE OFFICE OF AFFORDABILITY THE CULMINATION OF YEARS OF WORK ON BEHALF OF LABOR AND STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE MADE. MANY ATTEMPTS TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO CONTROL THE SKYROCKETING COSTS OF HEALTH CARE. ALL THIS WORK HAS LED US TO THIS POINT OF TAKING A STRATEGIC DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO ANALYZE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE STATE. TO GET AT THE ROOT PROBLEM OF AFFORDABILITY QUALITY ACCESS AND EQUITY. IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYER COVERAGE INCREASED BY TWO HUNDRED AND 49% BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND TWO THOUSAND SAYS SEVENTEEN. SIX TIMES THE RATE OF INFLATION. FOUR YEARS OUR MEMBERS HAVE FORGONE WAGE INCREASES IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO MAINTAIN AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY HEALTH COVERAGE USUALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES. MANY OF OUR BARGAINING DISPUTES WITH EMPLOYERS ARE TIED DIRECTLY TO EMPLOYERS TRYING TO SHIFT THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE ON TO WORKERS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER PREMIUMS AND HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS. THIS IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE WAY TO DO BUSINESS. A HANDFUL OF STATES INCLUDING MASSACHUSETTS MARYLAND RHODE ISLAND AND OREGON HAVE STARTED TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS BY TAKING A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE WHOLE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. PLEASE MODEL SERVE AS EVIDENCE THAT SYSTEMS AFFECT STATE WHY TARGET FOR REDUCING RATES. INCREASING COST TRANSPARENCY AND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE BASED DATA COLLECTION CAN AND WILL HELP CONSUMERS EMPLOYERS WORKERS AND TAXPAYERS. THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ADDRESSING THE SOARING COST OF HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIANS. HOWEVER WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THE JOBS OF OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AT THE EXPENSE OF COST CONTAINMENT. HEALTHCARE JOBS. ARE GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WITH HIGHLY SKILLED AND VALUED PROFESSIONAL. OFTENTIMES COST CUTTING PROVISIONS MEANS THAT WORKERS JOBS ARE TARGETED AS A COST SAVINGS MEASURE WHICH LEADS TO SHORT STAFFING HIGH TURNOVER AND LOWER QUALITY OF CARE. WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS A FAMILY MEMBER WITH THE OFFENSE AND STRENGTHENING LANGUAGE THAT RESPECT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THE OFFICE SUGGESTS THE HEALTHCARE COSTS TARGET OR ITS APPROACHES AND NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE HEALTH WORKFORCE. WORKFORCE IS STRENGTHENED BY THIS PROPOSAL. INTO THE COMMITTEE QUESTION ON HOW THE OFFICE WOULD IMPACT WORKERS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN THE STATE. CALIFORNIA'S WORKING FAMILIES FACE SIRIUS AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES ON ALL FRONTS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC FROM HOUSING FOOD TRANSPORTATION CHILD CARE AND OTHER BASIC LIFE NECESSITIES. THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE IS UNSUSTAINABLE AND CONTINUES TO BE AN ONGOING NATIONAL AND STATE PROBLEM. LOW AND MODERATE INCOME WORKERS AND CONSUMERS ARE ESPECIALLY HARD HIT HARD WITH THE HIGH COST OF CARE. SUCH HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE FURTHER CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH CARE INEQUALITY AS WORKERS FOR THE WAGE INCREASES TO PAY FOR INCREASING PREMIUMS DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS THAT FUND THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ACCORDING TO THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER WORKERS WITH JOB BASED COVERAGE AND THEIR EMPLOYERS WILL SPEND AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ON PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS TO PREMIUMS ULTIMATELY COME OUT OF WORKERS POCKETS AS A PART AS THEY ARE PART OF WORKERS TOTAL COMPENSATION. IF WE DO NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HIGH COST. COMBINED SPENDING COULD REACH TWO HUNDRED AND SIX BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY THIRTY FOUR. BY IMPLEMENTING A MECHANISM THAT WOULD CURTAIL THE RISING COST OF CARE AND SHARING THOSE COST SAVINGS BUT THE WORKERS WHO'VE BEEN PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE WOULD RESULT IN MEANINGFUL FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR TAXPAYERS EMPLOYERS AND OUR MEMBERS. WITH LOWER PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS THE STATE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN FACT THE SAME ANALYSIS FROM UC BERKELEY'S LABOR CENTER THAT I CITED EARLIER ESTIMATES THAT IT WOULD BE FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE THE AUTHOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CELICA BALANCE OF COST CONTAINMENT. TO PROTECT WORKERS AND HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE AS WELL AS CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS IN THE STATE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU PASSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MS YASMIN ALLEN IS A PELLET. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ME PALLID WITH BACK CAL. THE STATE WIDE HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COLA WE ARE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF CREATING THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY EVERY CALIFORNIA CONSUMER WITH PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IS BEING HIT BY THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE THANK HIGHER PREMIUMS DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS AND FEELING THE IMPACT OF STAGNATING WAGES. SO MANY CONSUMERS FORGO CARE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT. RESTRICTIONS DOCTORS VISITS LAB TESTS OR OTHER NECESSARY KERR. THE OFFICE OF HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY AIMS TO TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH BY CONTAINING HEALTHCARE COSTS RESULTING FROM YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND GAUGING INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT CAN WORK THE OFFICE WOULD SET ENFORCEABLE COST TARGETS FOR THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEVY FINANCIAL PENALTIES OR OTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION IF AN ENTITY EXCEEDS THE TARGET. TARGETS WOULD BE SUPPLY SECTOR AND WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT REGIONAL VARIATION RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENCES AND COMPLEXITIES IN CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. UNLIKE RATE SETTING WHICH DETERMINES HOW MUCH A DOCTOR'S VISIT OR HOSPITAL STAY IS THE TARGET SERVES AS AN OVERALL GOAL OF THE INDUSTRY MUST MEET BUT PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY TO ACHIEVE IT IN A WAY THAT WORKS BEST. WELL ALL PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE OFFICE AND THE COST HER GUESTS HEARD ME SOME PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY UNDERGO MORE SCRUTINY THAN OTHERS FOR INSTANCE CALIFORNIA HAS AN EXTENSIVE AND ROBUST RATE REVIEW PROGRAM FOR HEALTH PLANS AND HEALTH INSURANCE. WHICH HAS PROVIDED A WEALTH OF INFORMATION AND OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS FOR CONSUMERS HOWEVER FOR PROVIDERS LIKE MEDICAL GROUPS AND HOSPITALS THERE'S MUCH LESS OVERSIGHT AND. UNDERSTANDING OF THE CUSTOMER'S. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. AGENCY OVER SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY BUT NO AGENCY TASKED WITH LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE SECTOR MUCH LESS SETTING GOALS FOR AFFORDABILITY QUALITY AND EQUITY. AND WE WILL NEVER MEET A GOAL THAT WE DON'T SIX. THANK TO THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTIONS WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED OFFICE WOULD HAVE BROAD IMPACTS FOR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY RESEARCH ANALYSIS FROM BOTH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION AND THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER SHOW THAT USING AN APPROACH LIKE THE OFFICE COULD SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. RESULTING IN LOWER PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS. ON THE SECOND QUESTION IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT ARE THE ONES PAYING THE BILLS. IT HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL GROUPS RAISE THEIR PRICES INSURERS JUST RAISE PREMIUMS OR INCREASE COST SHARING. EMPLOYERS MAY TAKE ON WAGES OR INCREASE YOUR PREMIUM OR DEDUCTIBLES FOR WORKERS. ONE RESULT HAS BEEN THE GROWTH OF HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS EXPOSING CONSUMERS TO EXTREMELY HIGH COSTS OFTEN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF EXPOSURE BEFORE COVERAGE EVEN KICKS IN. THE DATA SHOWS AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT THE MAIN COST DRIVER AND HEALTH CARE IS NOT HIGH UTILIZATION BUT HIGHER PRICES. AND THOSE HIGH PRICES ARE NOT CORRELATED WITH MORE CARE OR BETTER CARE. WELL THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM INDUSTRY HAS GOTTEN VERY SOPHISTICATED ON HOW IT CAN MAXIMIZE PROFITS FOR EXECUTIVES AND SHAREHOLDERS THE OFFICE WILL FOCUS THE INDUSTRY ON HOW TO PROVIDE A REAL AFFORDABILITY TO CALIFORNIA. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PLEASED TO PROPOSE TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT DIRECTOR SO I WENT OUT OF ORDER BUT MAYBE IT'S NICE FOR YOU TO COME BACK NOW. AND BE ABLE TO. DO PRESENTATION ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM. THE ADVOCATES SAY LIKE IT. AND THEN PROVIDERS NOT SO MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- EVERYONE GOT A BREAK FROM HEARING FROM ME AND I GOT TO HAVE A DRINK OF WATER SO. HAPPY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON ON WHERE WE ARE IN THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. PROPOSAL WHICH WE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMMITTEE PREVIOUSLY HEARD IN FEBRUARY- SO JUST TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOT YET MODIFIED THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. BUT IS NOTED WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT'S OFFICE AND TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE PROPOSED OFFICE- SO THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE UNDER OUR ONGOING. BUT I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT. HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE BILL AS A RESULT OF THE CONVERSATIONS. SO WE'VE HEARD A LOT EARLY ON ABOUT CONCERNS ABOUT THE REPORTING TIMELINE. OUR DUTY IMPACT OF THE- SO FOLKS OF WE WE'VE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT THE IMPACT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. SO IN TERMS OF THE DATA AND THE YEAR IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO. WE'RE PROPOSING TO HAVE- DATA COLLECTED. FOR TWENTY TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO RELEASE TRY TO LOOK AT THE WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC WAS IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL COST OF CARE. DATA THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH HIS INITIAL DATA SET. FOR WITH THE BASELINE DATA SO WE'RE LOOKING TO PUSH OUT- SO THAT THE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHAT ESTABLISH THE BASELINE- AND OFSHE HEAD WOULD REPORT ON THIS DATA- IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE FIRST YEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE- A MEASUREMENT AGAINST OUR COST TARGET WOULD BE FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DATA. AND THEN THE FIRST TIME THERE WOULD BE SECTOR SPECIFIC TARGETS BE TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN SO ALL THAT TO SAY IS WE'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS YOU KNOW PANDEMIC DATA IS NOT- SHOULDN'T BE THE BASS LINE. AND SO WE PUSHED ALL THOSE TIME FRAMES OUT. WE'VE HEARD A VARIETY OF TYPES OF FEEDBACK ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE ADVISORY BOARD AND AGREED WITH ADDING TWO MORE MEMBERS TO BRING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE- ADVISORY BOARD TO ELEVEN- ONE MEMBER WHAT EXPLICITLY REPRESENTED PURCHASER OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE YOUR BENEFITS. WITH EXPERIENCE AND HELPFUL EVERY FINANCING MANAGEMENT OR ADMINISTRATION AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO ADD ON THE CALPERS CHIEF HEALTH DIRECTOR OR THEIR DESIGNEES- ON THE HEALTH CARE COST TARGETS. WE'VE AGREED WITH CLARIFYING THAT THE ARCH THAT DIRECTOR CAN YOU JUST COST TARGETS BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION SUBREGION SUBREGION- AND SECTORS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE NATIONAL DIRECTOR DETERMINES THE COST TARGET TO DIFFER FROM THE COST TARGET RECORD RECOMMENDED BY THE BOARD THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAVE TO ISSUE A PUBLIC REPORT ON ALTERNATE COST TARGETS DEMONSTRATING THAT THE ALTERNATE TARGET WOULD RESULT IN GREATER SAVINGS HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS. THAN THAT SET BY THE BOARD WITHOUT REDUCING THE QUALITY OF CARE. WE'VE ALSO HEARD CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT APPROACH SO REALLY WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE FUNDING FOR SMALLER PROJECT THE OFFICE WOULD BE- VERY PROGRESSIVE IN NATURE- WE WOULD SEEK TO ASSIST HEALTHCARE ENTITIES. THAT COME INTO COMPLIANCE INCLUDING THROUGHOUT REACH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS BEFORE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES UNLESS THE VIOLATION IS EGREGIOUS. AN EXAMPLE OF A GRADE JUST VIOLATIONS WHEN MERITED MINISTRY TO PENALTIES WOULD BE REPEATED FAILURE TO FILE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN FOR EXAMPLE OR REPEATED FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT- I CORRECTED. CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. FOR INVESTMENTS IN CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WE ALSO AGREE WITH REQUIRING THE SPENDING BENCHMARKS FOR PRIMARY CARE TO CONSIDER CURRENTLY FORM UNDER FUNDING OF PRIMARY CARE SERVICES AND ISSUE RAISED BY- THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND ON HEALTHCARE WORK FOR STABILITY WE AGREE THAT IN PURSUING AFFORDABILITY WE WOULD RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BOTH MAINTAIN AND INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND TO RESPECT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE CLARIFICATIONS AS TO WHAT THE OFFICES ROLE WOULD BE WITH RESPECT TO CONSOLIDATION MAKING CLEAR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OFFICE AND THOSE KIND OF EXISTING JURISDICTIONS IN THOSE AREAS. SO THIS IS SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE ISSUES WE'VE WORKED OUT- WHICH I THINK REFLECTS A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT ON BY ALL OF THE PARTIES REPRESENTED HERE TODAY AS WELL AS OTHERS AND AGAIN REALLY WANT TO STRESS THAT THERE ARE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS. LEGISLATIVE ENGAGEMENT IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE OFFICE AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE HERE TO LISTEN TO YOUR FEEDBACK AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN CAN WE GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI AN APARTMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU THE L. A. O. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN HAVE COREY SHE CAN FROM THE L. A. ALL THREE VERY BRIEF AGAIN- WE JUST HAVE A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL GENERALLY YOU KNOW IN A MAJOR CONCERNS TO RAISE JUST A FEW. CONSIDERATIONS TO BRING UP GOING FORWARD- YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS OFFICE WHICH YOU KNOW GENERALLY AS THE GOAL OF CONTAINING ESCALATING HEALTH CARE COSTS ACROSS THE STATE MAKES SENSE IN CONCERT- IS A METHOD TO RESPOND TO THE STATE'S AFFORDABILITY ISSUES- YOU KNOW WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES A VERY SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCE REQUESTS YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY RAMPING UP TO. OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY POSITIONS IN ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN A FEW YEARS- AND THAT THIS OFFICE IS LIKELY GOING TO BE VERY ADMINISTRATIVELY COMPLEX TO IMPLEMENT- THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF ENTITIES AS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. BE THERE PROVIDED ME THEY PROVIDERS OR PAYERS AND THIS OFFICE IS GOING TO NEED TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW WHAT INFORMATION TO COLLECT AND WHAT TARGETS THESE ENTITIES WILL NEED TO MEET A WHICH IS GOING TO BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT LIFT- YOU KNOW AS SUCH YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD THE LEGISLATURE ME ONE OF MONITOR SORT OF THE PROGRESS TOWARDS FULLY IMPLEMENTING- THIS PROPOSED OFFICES. STUDENTS GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW THIS COULD INCLUDE CHECKING IN WITH SOME DEGREE OF REGULARITY ON WHETHER THE LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES ATTACHED TO THIS PROPOSAL ARE OUR PROCREATE- YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS TO SOME EXTENT. BASING ITS RESOURCE REQUEST WAS ALSO ON ACTIVITIES IN ANOTHER STATE- WHICH MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE SAID TO CALIFORNIA'S SITUATIONS. THAT THAT SOME ALL OR COMMENTS. ON THIS ISSUE THANK VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND DIRECT I WOULD HAVE- COMMITTEE I THINK WE PROBABLY. ALL WE ALL SEE THE NEED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND ANNA- IN MY EARLIER CONVERSATIONS WITH DOCTOR WOULD. TWIN THE QUESTIONS I ASK WHAT TOOK US SO LONG TO GET HERE ECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PLACE AND CAN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO BE HAVING. BUT OF COURSE. IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS IN IN GETTING IT DONE- CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BITABOUT AND I KNOW. I KNOW WE'RE TALKING. ALSO ABOUT THE ISSUE OF A- OF ACCESS AND EQUITY- BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A SITTING DIFFERENT TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS AROUND THE STATE. ONE OF THE ISSUES OF COURSE WE HAVE IS NOT HAVING ENOUGH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND IN MORE RURAL AREAS AND IN MORE. AREAS WHERE- MAYBE THE QUALITY OF LIVING ISN'T QUITE AS GLAMOROUS OR R. OR THE PAY IS NOT QUITE AS HIGH- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THEN HOW DO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN. A PROVIDERS IN ALL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA HAS WE REALLY LOOK GOING TOWARD COST CONTAINMENT- HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE WE BALANCE. REGIONAL EQUITY AS WELL AS COST CONTAINMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE AND ONE THAT WE DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT AS MUCH TODAY BUT WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR AGAIN THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE OFFICE IS- NOT TO HAVE A RACE TO THE BOTTOM RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO CONTROL COSTS. BY PUTTING ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM SUCH THAT WE LOSE PROVIDERS QUITE THE OPPOSITE SO AS YOU NOTED WE DO HAVE COMPONENTS THAT LOOK TO MEASURE QUALITY- AND EQUITY AND WE WANT TO LEVERAGE THE WORK BEING DONE BY FIVE MEDIC CAL AND- COVER CALIFORNIAN DMH SEAT AND OTHERS IN TERMS OF QUALITY IN EQUITY METRICS. AND THEN IN TERMS OF PRIMARY CARE YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION AND THE OFFICE WOULD SPECIFICALLY MEASURE AND PROMOTE OF A BASELINE SPENT ON PRIMARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE ENOUGH INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND THAT THAT INVESTMENT IN TURN HELPS BRING DOWN COSTS AND SO WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT- ON A REGIONAL BASIS JUST TRY TO ADDRESS EXACTLY THE QUESTION THAT. YOU CONCERNED THAT YOU POSE. OKAY THANK YOU I'M. MASTAKA PANDACAN. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I DO HAVE QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS. PRECIADO THAT'S- AND I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION- AND- I GUESS I WOULD JUST FIRST OF ALL- START OFF BY SAYING YOU KNOW MY CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THAT I'M A PHYSICIAN. AND I TAKE YOUR PEOPLE UNDER SEC- I ALSO TRIED PREVENT DISEASES WELL EFFECTIVE FEATURES AND THAT'S WHAT SPEND MOST MY TIME BUT ALSO KNOWLEDGE THAT PROBABLY FROM SPENDING POINT OF VIEW IF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY- HAVE HEALTH CARE NEEDS. IN FACT- LET'S REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE CHRONIC DISEASE- SPEND ABOUT THERE ABOUT 40% OF CALIFORNIANS- SO AS WE TRY TO CAP OFF COSTS JUST KEEP IN MIND WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT. IN FACT THE SICKEST 10% SPEND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF ALL HEALTH CARE SPENDING SO- SO JUST BEGAN A REMINDER OF WHO WERE IMPACTING- AND THEIR ACCESS TO CARE AS WELL. I ALSO THINK IT'S INTERESTING I DO NOTE THAT INTO TESTIMONY- WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- MEDICARE AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT MEDICARE'S FACED- IN TERMS OF THEIR PAYMENT- THE SVR WHO WAS A FAILED ATTEMPT BY CONGRESS TO TIE. PAYMENTS TO- ESSENTIALLY THE G. P. AND- OVER SEVERAL YEARS IN FACT OVER MORE IN A DECADE THAT BECAME A DISASTER AND FINALLY CONGRESS HAD TO STEP IN AND FIX THAT- BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO QUOTE PEAK YOU KNOW THINGS MORE AFFORDABLE OR TO. LIMIT SPENDING BUT BECAUSE IT IN ACTUALLY TIED IT TO AND ECONOMIC DATA MARKER THAT WAS NOT RELATED TO ACTUAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS IT CERTAINLY CAUSED ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS THE OTHER THING ACTUALLY APPROVE APROPOS WAS IS REGARDING- PAYMENT RATES. AS WELL FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS- AND MEDICARE ACTUALLY THE ESTABLISHED REGIONS WHEN MEDICARE WAS ESTABLISHED ANSWERS ENOUGH SACRAMENTO AT THE TIME I KNOW SOME PEOPLE CALL US A COW TOWN IT'LL THE CORE CAL TOWN BUT- YOU KNOW WE WILL CONSIDER RULE ACTUALLY WHEN MEDICARE WAS ESTABLISHED. IN FACT- THE PROBLEM WAS IS THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR AREAS LIKE SACRAMENTO EVEN THOSE WE BECAME MORE URBANIZED AND- AND ACTUALLY COSTS A PRACTICE WENT UP WE WERE STILL REIMBURSE. WISE FOR MEDICARE TO BEING- SAY AS THE OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT DIDN'T REFLECT OUR THE COST OF A PRACTICE SO. AGAIN I THINK REGIONAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE GONNA BE IMPORTANT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO REFLECT THIS AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR BRING OUT- ISSUE THAT OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT SOMEONE HAS SOME COST ANALYSIS AS- YEAH RULED PRACTICES. WHAT CHEAPER BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY YEAH. THAT RENTAL COSTS OTHER TYPES OF EXPENSES ARE ARE PERHAPS LESS BUT THEN THAT BECOMES A DISINCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TEND TO GO INTO PRACTICE. IN THIS AREA SO. THAT WILL BE HAVE TO BE MONITORED CAREFULLY- BUT I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTOR- MENTIONING ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS L. TALKING TO- DOCTOR WOULD DO IS CARRYING A BILL- THAT- WE'RE THE SENATE HERE. SO THERE'S TWO HOUSES THE LEGISLATURE I TAP INTO CHAIRED A HEALTH COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE TO AND DOES SO I HAVEN'T HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS AT ALL WITH THAT. DIRECTOR LANDS VERY ABOUT THIS- WHEN AM I GOING TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT A DETAILED POLICY DISCUSSION. IN REGARD TO THIS AND IS THE PLAN ADMINISTRATION TO SIMPLY IMPLEMENT THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET ARE THERE IS DOCTOR WOODS- ASSEMBLY RELIGIOUS- BILL'S GOING TO BE THE VEHICLE AND SO WE'LL HAVE A- FULL POLICY DISCUSSION. HERE IN THE SENATE AS WELL IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH. SO CAN YOU PLEASE. TELL ME WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENTIONS ARE. WELL SAID MANAGE YOU KNOW THE IS BUDGET PROPOSAL. IT IS A JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THERE IS THE PARALLEL. OF POLICY BILL AS AS YOU REFERENCE AND SO AT THIS POINT. IT'S UP TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PROCESS TO WORK ITS WAY THROUGH AS AS WHICH VEHICLE MOVES OKAY WELL AND YES IT IS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE END THAT WILL DECIDE- BUT WHAT IS. THE PREFERENCE OF THE ADMINISTRATION. WE DO NOT HAVE A STATED PREFERENCE AT THAT AT THIS TIME SAID OR OKAY SO- AND- SO I GUESS I WOULD MAKE NO THEN IS THAT- CERTAINLY WE WOULD WANT TO POLICY VETTING. OF THIS PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE- SO WHICH WHICHEVER THROUGHOUT EVERY VENUE- WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT- SUMMER WOODS BILL AT THE TIME IT'S A- PASSED OUT OF THE- COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND ASSEMBLY. WAS DESCRIBED MERRILEES WORK IN PROGRESS I HEAR YOU SAY THEY'RE STILL. EVEN THOUGH YOU DID SAY A FEW THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING. IT'S STILL WORK IN PROGRESS MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING TO STAFF IN THE SUB COMMITTEE THAT IT THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF MISSING PIECES- WHAT WHAT POINT TIME WE HAVE A FULL PROPOSAL SO WE COULD DO A FULL POLICY GUIDING. SO IN TERMS I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD- ALSO WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO HIS OFFICE- AS WELL AS TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS. SO AS YOU NOTED THERE WERE SOME- THAT. AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN AND IN POLICY COMMITTEE AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE MAY BE AN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS. BEING TAKEN ON THEIR PREPARATIONS AND WE ARE WORKING TO TRY TO SORT THROUGH ALL OF THE- POLICY ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. OKAY SO I GUESS I'M ONE OF THOSE WHEN SHOULD I EXPECT SINCE I ALSO SUB UPSET ON THE SUB COMMITTEE AS WELL AS CHAIRED HEALTH COMMITTEE WHEN CAN I EXPECT A FULL POLICY PROPOSAL. TO REVIEW- PRIOR TO BEING EXPECTED TO VOTE ON IT. WHETHER IT'S IN POLICY OR AND WHETHER IT'S IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE OR AND- POLICY COMMITTEE. AS NOTED SENATOR WE ARE WE ARE WORKING- AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN TO TRY TO RESOLVE ALL THE ISSUES I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT DATE FOR YOU BUT CERTAINLY NOTE- THAT THEY NEED TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE PLAN. THAT THE REMAINING ISSUES SO DO I HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM YOU TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME ASSURE THE HEALTH COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE. OF COURSE INSTITUTE ABOUT BEFORE- THIS. BEFORE THIS COMES UP FOR A VOTE AND THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER IT'S AND BUDGET OR IN POP INCIDENT AND IN THE- SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE. OF COURSE IN YOUR PANTS OKAY. ALL RIGHT- I DO HAVE SEVERAL. QUESTIONS TO HELP ME FLESH OUT AT LEAST SOME OF THE POLICY ISSUES. HERE SO YOU KNOW YOU DO REFERENCE THERE WERE. CERTAIN CAL STATES FOR SPENDING TARGETS INCLUDING CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE. WHAT KIND OF DATA DOES YOUR- DOES DID THE ADMINISTRATION OR YOUR- NOW DEPARTMENT I GUESS MY NAME IS A DEPARTMENT. OF THE OFFICE. WITH THAT DO YOU FEEL WILL BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO APPROACH POLICE. ESTABLISH. EVIDENCE BASED SPENDING TARGETS. SO WE SEEK TO COLLECT SOME DATA ON THE TOTAL COST OF CARE AND SO THAT IS BOTH ACCESSING DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE- THROUGH YOUR REACHES ENTITIES NOW BUT IT'S REALLY IT'S PRIMARILY COLLECTING DATA FROM THE PAYERS- AS YOU. THE TOTAL COST OF CARE INCLUDES- PREMIUM PAYMENTS SO THAT AS YOU KNOW THE APCD R. R. H. P. D. DATABASE PROGRAM IS PRIMARILY LOOKING AT CLAIMS. AND THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND IN GATHERING THE TOTAL COST OF CARE DATA WILL LOCK IN ADDITION TOUGH CLAIMS PAID- WILL ALSO LOOK AT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. PREMIUM PAYMENTS COPAYS THAT ARE MADE BY- THE CONSUMERS. AND WILL LOOK AT BOTH CLAIMS. AND NON THINGS OKAY. OKAY SO ON THE SIDE WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE PLAYERS CLAIMS DATABASES IT UP AND RUNNING FULLY OR YOU FULLY COLLECTING OR WHEN YOU EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN BYE IT IS NOT FULLY UP AND RUNNING AND I'M GONNA SEE IF MIKE VALLEY CAN. CAN JUMP AND ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT EXACTLY WHEN WILL HAVE ALL THAT DATA BUT JUST TO NOTICE AS YOU AND I DISCUSSED BRIBERY WE DON'T NEED ALL THE DATA FROM THE- FROM THE- H. P. D. IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT CAPTURE THE TOTAL COSTS OF WHERE AND WHEN DID YOU EXPECT ALL THE DATA. MIKE VALLEY ARE YOU THERE. I AM HERE THANK. YOU THANK YOU DIRECTOR LANDSBERG AND THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD FOR THE QUESTION- REGARDING THE HEALTHCARE PAYMENTS- DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION- CALIFORNIA'S AUTHOR CLAIMS IT REYES WE ARE ON TRACK AND MAKING PROGRESS TO SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE THE DATABASE BY JULY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE AS DESCRIBED IN. IN STATUTE WERE WERE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH WITH STAKEHOLDERS- AS WELL AS COLLEAGUES OF THE CALIFORNIA PART OF TECHNOLOGY ON. ON THE DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE FOR THE DATABASE ITSELF. A NUMBER ALSO ON TRACK TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS FOR DATA COLLECTION CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE A PLACE. DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE AT LEAST THREE YEARS OF HISTORICAL DATA AVAILABLE WHEN. A DATABASE FINANCIALLY COMPLETE JULY TWENTY THREE OKAY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT WHILE THERE WAS WELL SAID THAT YOU DON'T NEED ALL THE INFORMATION I WAS EXPECTED NEEDS A SUBSTANTIAL. PORTION THIS INVESTORS- INFORMATION SO THAT'S THAT THAT IS AND THEN SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT SO JUST COLLECTING THE DATA. DATA. ANALYSIS TAKES TIME AS WELL SO THERE'S- A BRIEF TIME TO. JANUARY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY FOUR. SO ASIDE FROM THIS PAYMENT DATA- YOU KNOW HEALTH CARES ABOUT HEALTH. SO ASIDE FROM THE PAYMENT DATA WHAT WHAT OTHER INPUTS ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THAT YOU TINK ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A SPENDING TARGET. WELL AS YOU KNOW WE WILL BE COLLECTING DATA ON ON QUALITY AND EQUITY- AND SO WE WILL WANT TO DO THAT IN TANDEM BEFORE THERE IS ANY ENFORCEABLE COST TARGET THAT IS SET AND WHAT KIND OF- AND YOU CAN USE. SO FOR EXAMPLE QUALITY DATA. WHAT KIND OF QUALITY DATA ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THAT YOU THAT YOU NEED TO COLLECT. SO WE WANT TO LEVERAGE EXISTING EFFORTS- TO NOT UNNECESSARILY DUPLICATE SO I KNOW THE NEXT ITEM YOU'RE HEARING IS ABOUT THE NHC'S PROPOSAL IS THAT QUALITY AND EQUITY METRICS WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE EFFORTS UNDERWAY WITH MEDIC CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA WITH HEALTH FIRST. SO WE WILL HAVE A SUBSET OF OUR STAFF- AND RESEARCHERS THAT ARE LOOKING AT US SAID OF QUALITY DATA- AGAIN WANTING TO LEVERAGE EXISTING- SELECTED. OF MEASURES BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT QUALITY IS NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OKAY AS WE OPPOSE THE PAST ARE NO I AM AND I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK ONE NO TO SOMEONE WHO'S ALSO DONE RESEARCH IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT- IS THAT. QUALITY DATA IS OF COURSE MOST USUALLY AVAILABLE AND DISEASES THAT ARE FAIRLY WIDESPREAD- THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT. CERTAINLY IT'S A LOT EASIER TO COLLECT THE GETS MORE CHALLENGING WE TALK ABOUT RARE CONDITIONS FUND US THEY'RE JUST MUCH SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE- THAT- THERE- AND SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT NCQA OR YOU LOOK AT HE TO YOU KNOW THE IS VERY STATUS AT C. DISCOURSE BASED ON MINISTRY OF DATA- YOU KNOW IT'S- WELL CERTAINLY THE- CAN BE. HELPFUL AND YOU LOOK AT THE LIKE. OR DIABETES USUALLY HAVE LIKE AND LARGE NUMBERS WHEN YOU START TALKING TO SMALLER NUMBERS. ALTHOUGH HUMILIATE ALL THE SMALL OF THE SMALL NUMBER CONDITIONS ALTOGETHER IT'S ARE ACTUALLY STARTS TO BECOME A FAIRLY LARGE NMBER- BUT THE QUALITY DATA IS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING. AND THE SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN- DOING QUALITY DATA ANALYSIS. I THINK HOPEFULLY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE KNOWLEDGE TO FIGHT AND IT DIDN'T AND THE STUDIES OF THE TASK FORCE IS THAT WE'RE NOT OVERLY FOCUS JUST ON THE- CONDITIONS THAT. THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY DO HAVE A LARGER IMPACT. ON ON SPENDING BUT THE OTHER ONE'S HUMILITY. ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SPENDING. YES THERE IS A THIS IS ALWAYS THE HEARING YOU HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT EXPERTISE AND SO WE DO PLAN TO BRING IT YOU KNOW WORK OFF OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE MODELS AND SO I THINK YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN THAT- IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT WIDESPREAD DISEASES LIKE LIKE DIABETES AND OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS- THERE'S LESS FREQUENT BUT BUT VERY IMPACTFUL. LOCATIONS AS WELL SO I JUST MAKE NOTE THAT THERE MAY NOT BE DATA AT YOU KNOW THERE THERE MAY BE DATA VOIGTS OKAY BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S HARD TO COLLECTED ON THESE. SMALL CONDITIONS I'M NOT SAYING THAT- AND I THINK SO YOU NEED TO BE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY TO DEAL WITH THE DATA VOID ISSUE- THAT YOU DON'T SIMPLY SAY HELP BECAUSE THERE'S NO DATA THEREFORE WE DON'T HAVE TO. ARE WE YOU KNOW THE EXPANDING PART- YOU'D BE BASICALLY I THOUGHT U. ZERO ALTO OR- OR UNDERESTIMATE SO I JUST WANNA POINT THAT OUT AND THEN CERTAINLY EQUITY WHICH I. KNOW WILL HERE FROM THE NDC. THE I OFTENTIMES SOME ISSUE HARM PLACE BECAUSE- THE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO HAVE LESS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE OFTENTIMES HAVE LESS ACCESS TO PEOPLE ACTUALLY STUDY HOW WELL THEY'RE DOING. UNFORTUNATELY AND- SO. AGAIN EQUITY FRAMEWORK. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE SO. I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT AS A SOMEONE WHO IS- ASIAN. TO REPLICATE CHAIRS THE ATI CAUCUS AND- IT IS- ASIAN THAT- ACTUALLY I THINK ONLY IS VERY SMALL FRACTION OF STUDIES HAVE YOU GO LOOK AT THE LITERATURE PUBLISHED LITERATURE. ACTUALLY INCLUDE ATI IS A CATEGORY THAT THEY STUDIED. WE'RE USUALLY NOT THERE. WE DON'T EXIST. AND YET OUR COMMUNITY WHICH REPRESENTS BE COUNTING ON YOU TO NOT TO MAKE US DISAPPEAR. EVEN THOUGH THE RESEARCH DATA ISN'T THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T STUDIES. AND I HOPE I CAN COUNT ON YOU TO NOT DO THAT TO US. LOU THANK YOU FOR FLAGGING OUT OF. SELF AGAIN AS A DATA VOIGTS RIGHT. NOW THE OTHER ISSUE I ACTUALLY WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IS- THE ADVISORY BOARD AND IT WAS BROUGHT UP BUT- WHAT. HE'D SPEAK TO THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE ADVISORY BOARD TO YOU KNOW I'M I'M ELECTED OFFICIAL SAYS ONLY RESPONSIBLE TO VOTERS AND I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE- BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S SOME ARGUMENT THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE OVERLY- INFLUENCED BY POLITICAL AND FOR THE ADDRESS WITH BASICALLY SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY. EVIDENCE AND DATA SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE ADVISORY BOARD FROM LET'S SAY THE GOVERNOR OR OTHER ELECTED- BODIES. CERTAINLY CENTER PAINS OF THE CURRENT- PROPOSED STRUCTURE THAT WE PUT FORWARD DOES HAVE THE ADVISORY BOARD BEING PRIMARILY APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY WITH US A FEW EX OFFICIO. MEMBER ON THE FX TERMS WHERE THEY CANNOT FEED THAT DID ARE THEY SERVING AT WILL OR THE- ACTUALLY ONCE ARE POINTED THEY- HAVE SUFFICIENT TERMS IN THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO. DISMISSAL UNLESS OBVIOUSLY IF THEY COMPASSIONATE TO COMMIT SOME EGREGIOUS ACT OR SOMETHING SO IS THERE DEBT LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE. I BELIEVE THERE ARE FIXED TERMS YES OKAY ALL RIGHT I WOULD CERTAINLY AGAIN WHAT IS POLICY THINGS I WOULD APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. AND THEN THAT DID COME UP WITH THE F. DEFINITION OF A PROVIDER AND AGAIN I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SPECIFICS- SO- AND IT WAS MEN. BY CMA. THAT FOR EXAMPLE A SOLO PRACTICE DOCTOR WOULD BE CONSIDERED A PROVIDER- IT IS SOAKING FIRST OF ALL CAN YOU TELL ME THAT'S TRUE AND THEN LET'S SEE A DENTIST IS A DENTIST A PROVIDER UNDER JUST DEFINITIONS THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THE SAME THING. AND THEN FINALLY A CHIROPRACTOR WITH THEY ALSO FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION AS WELL. SO AN YOU SELL INDIVIDUAL SOLO PRACTICE PHYSICIAN INDEPENDENT PRACTICE. DENTIST AND THE CNTRACTOR. BUT ALSO UNDER THE PHOENICIAN. YOUR LAST POINT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE YES THE LITTLE ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS WOULD SERVE- FOR FOUR YEARS SO WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE IN TERMS OF WHETHER A SINGLE PRACTITIONER WOULD. BE SUBJECT TO THE COST TARGET- NO THEY CERTAINLY WOULD NOT- THE BILL THAT WE ARE RELEASED IN. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OF THE MEASURES RELEASED IN EARLY FEBRUARY LEAVES OPEN THE DEFINITION OF A HEALTH CARE ENTITY THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO COST TARGET WE WILL LEAVE THAT UP TO REGULATIONS- WE UNDERSTAND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. THERE'S THAT THAT DEFINITION B. B. SEVEN STATURE IS ARE WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING- ON WHAT THE NUMBER HOW LARGER PRACTICE SHOULD BE INCLUDED. IN THAT DEFINITION OF HEALTH CARE ENTITY. OKAY AND THEN AND THEN- SO. SO THAT SEEM A REPRESENTS. DOCTORS ABOUT DENNISON CHIROPRACTORS. YEAH DO THEY NOT DOWN THERE SO YOU KNOW YOU SMALL GROUPS EVEN HAVE LARGE YOU HAVEN'T HAVE LARGE GROUPERS LARGE GROUPS OF THOSE ENTITIES AS WELL. YEAH I DO NOT BELIEVE WE PLAN TO INCLUDE DENTISTS- AND WE AGAIN WILL WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL DEFINITION. OF EXEMPTED- REGULATION EXEMPTION PROVIDERS IN THE IN THE REGULATIONS- SO THE LINES OF BUSINESS WILL BE IDENTIFIED I DON'T. THE H. P. FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE CHOSEN NOT TO START DOCUMENTS- DENTISTRY- AT THE OUTSET- AND NOR NOR CHIROPRACTORS. OKAY AND- AND THAT WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT BILLIONS ARE SPENT IN ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE. EXPENSES IS THAT GOING TO BE ALSO UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THIS- OF THIS BODY- THAT IS A SUBSTANTIAL. PORTION OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING. I'M CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION OF THE TOTAL COST OF CARE DOESN'T INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT A CONSUMER CHOSE TO SPEND ON THEIR OWN OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOME OKAY REYES SAYS IT'S OUTSIDE HEALTH COVERAGE SO THEREFORE FOR EXAMPLE CONCIERGE PRACTICES WOULD NOT FALL UNDER THIS. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'M HAPPY FOR MY FAILURE OR WRITE ABOUT THE TO CORRECTLY I DON'T THINK WE'VE REACHED THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL OKAY SO AND THEN I GUESS AND I REALIZE THAT. BUT THEN WE STARTING TO EQUITY ISSUE. RIGHT AFTER ALL WHO CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE GOING TO BE A SYSTEM WHERE WE SAY GUESS WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT RICHARD RICH ENOUGH YOU CAN BUY OUT IF YOU'RE NOT RICH ENOUGH YOU'RE STUCK UNDER A CAPS. CORRECT WELL CONCIERGE PAYMENTS ARE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE USUAL COPAYS- OKAY LIKE THAT AGAIN I JUST POSE THAT OUT THERE TO THINK ABOUT OKAY SO YEAH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO BUY THEMSELVES OUT. ESSENTIALLY OKAY- THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT- SO IN TERMS OF THAT OTHER INPUTS- THIS PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING THESE COST TARGETS. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. A YEAH AND YOU KNOW THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE KNOW THAT ONE DRIVER HEALTHCARE COSTS THIS TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE CHANGING TECHNOLOGY. ANOTHER ONE IS FOR EXAMPLE NEW DISEASES HAVING CERTAINLY THAT HOPEFULLY IS QUITE EVIDENT TO ANYONE RIGHT NOW AS WE ARE FACING COVET AND CORONAVIRUS. YOU KNOW IT HIV BEFORE AND SO FORTH- HOW AND THEN IT SO HOW HOW DO YOU SEE THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS WHEN YOU HAVE- AND PROJECT YET AND EVENTUALLY I DID WORKFORCE PROJECTIONS BEFORE IN MY- PREVIOUS RESEARCH AS A THE FOR KIND OF THE LEGISLATURE- SO. OFTEN TIMES AGAIN THESE ARE PLACES WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE PLAYING YOU KNOW BEST PLANS GO AWRY. BUT IF YOU DON'T DO THINGS RIGHT THEN YOU SUDDENLY SAY GUESS WHAT WE DON'T NEED MORE ID DOCTORS AND THEN HIV STARTS SHOWING UP AND WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THAT HAS ON. ON POPULATIONS. SO HOW HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS MAYBE SOMEWHAT LOW MORE PREDICTABLE AND YOU DISEASES AND TRYING TO PROJECT AND TRYING TO ESTABLISH THESE KIND OF SPENDING TARGETS TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T DENY CARE. OR UNDER RESOURCE CARE FOR POPULATIONS ANY PARTICULAR VULNERABLE. TO THESE CONDITIONS. YES ARE NONE SO IT IS REASONWERE INTEREST IN COLLECT THE DATA ON CURRENT. YEAR IS- AT SOME POINT OF COMPARISON WHO KNOWS- WHAT WHAT WILL BE COMING OUR WAY SO WE THINK THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT BASELINE DATA AS WELL AS TO HOPEFULLY HAVE- IF WE IF WE GET BACK TO A NEW NORMAL IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE HAVE. HAVE THAT BASELINE DATA- WE CERTAINLY THINK THERE WILL BE. IT WOULD WE WOULD. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS THE ADVISORY BOARD LOOKS TO SET THE COST TARGET TO ALLOW FOR THE INCREASE HOPEFULLY IS GOING TO EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED TO GO TO- IT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPROVE CARE WHICH WOULD BE- IT. A VALUABLE INNOVATIONS AS WELL AS A- INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGYSO ONE OF THE PIECES THAT THE- OFFICE WILL ALSO BE DOING IS TRYING TO PROMOTE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS- WE THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT VEHICLES. TO HELP. INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENTS- IN IN TECHNOLOGY AND THEN THE MOST INNOVATIVE EFFECTIVE. MEDICAL STRATEGIES. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW SHE SAID THE WORD HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY IS A LITTLE SCARY BECAUSE HOPEFULLY. I THINK WE NEED TO PLAN FOR THIS WE NEED TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY ANTICIPATE FOR THIS THIS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ADVISE YOU COMMITTEES RESPONSES. TO THIS THAT THEY DON'T TO AT IT OR NOT AND NOT NOT UNRESPONSIVE TO THIS SO HOPEFULLY IT'S MORE THAN. HOPEFULLY SO I SAID HOPEFULLY BECAUSE- THEY DíAS TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD INSIST. THAT WE ARE CORRECT FOR THIS- AND THEN CERTAINLY ONE PART THAT SHOULD BE VERY PREDICTABLE AS THE AGING POPULATION AND INCREASING DEMAND FOR THAT SO. AS. WE LOOK AT HEALTH- IT'S- I MEAN THAT'S ONE RE WHY. IS GOING TO BE FASTER INFLATION BECAUSE THE POPULATION IS NOT GONNA BE THE SAME NEXT YEAR IT'S A YEAR OLDER AND WELL YES WE DO HAVE PEOPLE DYING AT ONE END AND PEOPLE BEING BORED THE OTHER. WE KNOW THAT THE OVERALL AGE AVERAGE AGE OF OUR POPULATION IS INCREASING. OVER A OVER TIME AND THAT- AND THAT IS THEY'RE DOING THAT THE COSTS TARGETS. AT THAT WE NEED TO JUST WITHOUT GIVING ANY NOTICE AYE AYE HE HEARD THE TESTIMONY AND THAT'S IT I KNOW IT'S COMMONLY SAID THAT- WE ALWAYS SPEND 30% HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE NECESSARY- BUT I WOULD BE NO STATUS IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH- PREVIOUS SECRETARY DULY- AT. THE CHALLENGES FINDING WHICH 30% RIGHT I MEAN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY START LOOKING INDIVIDUAL CASES I KNOW IT'S COMMONLY THROWN OUT THERE. BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THE STUDY WHICH ACTUALLY THEN THEY'LL SAY OKAY HERE'S THE 30% OF THE WASTEFUL PART. RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUSH COMES TO SHOVE AND EOPLE TRY TO FIND IT IT'S NOT SO EASY TO FIND. AND THEN. THE OTHER THING IS THE OTHER QUESTION YOU'VE MADE SOME REFERENCE TO THIS OKAY SO. LABOR COSTS- WE KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE AND HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY AGAIN. REPRESENTED BY THE UNIONS WHICH IS A GOOD THING I MYSELF AM A MEMBER OF THE LABOR UNIONS- SO ARE WE ARE SO IF AN ENTITY ACTUALLY HAS A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. AND THAT LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN WAGES AND BENEFITS. THAT AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE THEIR COST TARGET REFLECTOR INCREASE IN LABOR EXPENSES ESPECIALLY SINCE 60% OF HEALTHCARE IS LABOR. SO WE THERE IS OF CURRENTLY LANGUAGE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOODS BILL THAT LOOKS TO- HAVING TO RECOGNIZE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CHANGES AS AS AN INPUT TO BE CONSIDERED. JUST TO BE CONSIDERED WELL AS AS AN ECONOMIC INDICATOR AS PART OF THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THAT'S DONE OKAY- EVALUATE THE COST ARGUE. OKAY SO- I JUST WANT TO BE A LOT SO YOU YES SOMEONE'S NEGOTIATING AND THERE FOR IT IS I THINK WE NEED TO BE CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE TO THE- TO THE- EMPLOYERS WHO ARE NEGOTIATING AS WELL AS THE UNIONS THAT- THAT DOESN'T BECOME AN EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH OR TO- TO LIMIT- BECAUSE- YEAH. THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS LIKE YOU HAVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT YOU GO TO ADVISORY COMMITTEE BAG DEVICE OR CAN BE DIVIDED COMMITTEE DECIDES YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS LATER FINALLY OKAY WILL GIVE. YOU AN INCREASE BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S CETERA. AND THEN PEOPLE SAY NEXT COLLECTIVE ARE GAS. SO WE DON'T GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN- SO I THINK WE NEED TO BUILD IN SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE- ASSURED- FOR PEOPLE THAT- THAT WHEN THERE'S A- YOU KNOW FAIR BARGAINING CONTRACT THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE REFLECTED. SO THAT THEY CAN GET- SO THAT- THAT DOESN'T BECOME A BARRIER TO- TO NEGOTIATING A FAIR CONTRACT- I CERTAINLY CAN ASK MANY MANY MORE QUESTIONS BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SENATE- AND- IS TERRENCE AND HELPED ME ON THE POLICY ISSUES PRIOR TO ANY VOTE. ON THIS PROPOSAL AND- AND- SO LOOK FOR TO PERHAPS EXPLORING. OTHER ADDITIONAL ISSUES AND AGAIN IS THAT YOU MENTIONED- SUMMER WOODS BILL HAS NOT MADE IT OVER THE SENATE YET SO WELL YOU MADE REFERENCE TO IT- ASIDE FROM THE BROADER OUTLINES- I HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DELVE INTO IT MORE DEEPLY AND FACT- PROBABLY. WANT TO SEE WHAT THE VERSION COMES OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS. AND ASSEMBLY- SO I KNOW WHAT I'M WORKING WITH THEIR BUT I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAM MY STUFF OR JUST YOUR STAFF THIS AFTERNOON SET. SOMETHING UP OKAY THANK YOU. COURSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AT. CLEARLY THERE'S A LAW OF INTEREST ON THIS TOPIC- IN BOTH HOUSES IN BOTH HOUSES SO WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO THAT- THAT. THE MEMBER WOODS BILL MAKING OVER TO THE SIDE FOR A FULL POLICY HEARING- BUT- AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE THE- THE NEED I THINK WE ALL HAVE. TO REALLY GRAPPLE WITH THIS ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY- BOTH AS DR PAN SAID PUT OUR AGING POPULATION. AND THEN ALSO AS WE SPOKE BEFORE ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS- AND I GUESS IS THE POINT I WANT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE IS THAT WE LOOK AT EQUITY. ACROSS THE STATE WITH A LOT OF ATTENTION TO OUR DIFFERENT REGIONS- FIVE. IT WITH A DIFFERENT REGIONS AND THAT IT'S IT DOESN'T EXIST PROVIDERS DON'T EXIST IN A SILO RIGHT THEY WORKING AND OF. ORGANIZATIONS THAT OFTENTIMES ARE LESS RESOURCE AND OFTENTIMES ARE TREATING PEOPLE AS START DEPEND HAS SAID BEFORE WHO HAVE EVEN HIGHER. HEALTH NEEDS- AND IT'S HARDER TO KEEP PEOPLE THERE OF PROVIDERS THEIR- BECAUSE OFTENTIMES OUR SCHOOLS DON'T REFLECT. THE HIGH QUALITY. THAT SOME FOLKS ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY WHEN THEY COME OUT OF- COLLEGE WITH A WHOLE LOT OF DEBT SO UP IT JUST NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN. IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALL THE OTHER FACTORS THAT GO INTO OUR HEALTH OUTCOMES BECAUSE AGAIN AS WE LOOK AT COSTS WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT. OUTCOMES AND WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE. M. AND THEN JUST TO SAY THAT SOMEBODY WHO SERVED ON A STOCKTON CITY COUNCIL WHEN WE WENT INTO THE VERY PAINFUL BANKRUPTCY A LOT OF THAT. WAS DUE TO THE MORTGAGE MELTDOWN BUT THERE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT RELATED TO OUR OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS- SO I CERTAINLY HOPE AND WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING IN. COLLABORATION I KNOW WE'VE GOT. SOME FOLKS FROM LABOR. BUT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP AND DOWN STATE. ARE AT THE- ON THE PRECIPICE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE IT WITH OUR HEALTH CARE COST SO MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE THOSE THINGS INTO. CONSIDERATION ALSO. AND BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT JUST MAINTAINS A GOOD HEALTHY WORK FORCE AND GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND CONSERVANCY FOR ABLE TO. PROPERLY AND HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH BENEFITS. OKAY AND WITH THAT I THINK WILL MOVE ON AND TAKE YOUR IMAGINATION IN DIRECTIONS. OKAY NOW WE ARE MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER AT WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE. AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME OK WE CAN'T. YES GREAT SO I'M VERY MUCH NOT BE ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY ARE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR DANCE OTHER IS WELL.

THE PLANS WILL ANNUALLY SUBMIT A REPORT CONTAINING DATA AND INFORMATION ON THE MEASURES AND ANNUAL BENCHMARKS TO THE DAMAGE C. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- MEASUREMENT HERE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. DO YOU MAY SEE WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION WHEN HEALTH EQUITY AND QUALITY BENCHMARKS ARE NOT ARE NOT MET. THIS INCLUDES MONITORING CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AN IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS WERE NEEDED AND TAKING PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST NON COMPLIANT HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS AS APPROPRIATE. DMACC WILL PRODUCE ANNUAL HEALTH EQUITY IN QUALITY COMPLIANCE REPORT BEGINNING JUNE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE DEAL MAKES IT WILL MAKE CHANGES TO THE OVERCROWDING QUALITY MEASURES AND ANNUAL BENCHMARKS UNTIL THE REQUIREMENTS ARE CODIFIED IN REGULATION. IN ADDITION TO PLANTS AND THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS HEALTH PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE OR NCQA ACCREDITATION BY JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX. BROKE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROPOSAL THE GMAC WILL COLLABORATE WITH OPTIONAL DAC ASKAR CALIFORNIA CALPERS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN ESTABLISHING THE PRIORITIES SET A STANDARD ALL THE MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS. THE DH WILL COORDINATE THE INMATES YOU TO CONDUCT SIMILAR FOR K. ORGAN HEALTH SYSTEM- THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN HE KNOCKS KEEN LICENSE. THE DEAL MAKES THE REQUEST THE FOLLOWING.

AND HEALTH PLAN REPRESENTS READ IT REPRESENTATIVES PROVIDERS- AND OTHER ENTITIES WITH RELEVANT EXPERIENCE- ARE INCENTIVES TO ISSUE A SOURCE OF BOTH THE PATIENT FOR MEMBERS AND SELECT MEMBERS WITH EXPERTISE IN QUALITY MEASUREMENT BUT ALSO IN HEALTH EQUITY- THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE INCLUDING RACIAL ETHNIC CULTURAL GENDER GEOGRAPHIC. THANKS I ALSO MENTION PLAN TO CONQUER CANCER IN CERTAIN CONSOLE EXPERTISE IN THE SUBJECT AREA WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN PLAN WORK AND FACILITATING MEETING- WE'RE EXPECTING THAT THE X. COMES MAY I HAVE- EXPERTISE AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHO TO SOLICIT- PARTICIPATION ON THAT COMMITTEE AND CAN. HELP US WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS. ALL RIGHT MOVING ON TO QUESTION THREE PLEASE DESCRIBE SOME EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES OF ACCORDION QUALITY MEASURES AND BENCHMARK THAT COULD BECOME A NEW PLAN RESPONSIBILITIES AS A RESULT OF THOSE FOR PROPOSAL- TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON BOTH THE HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS AND TO AVOID DUPLICATION. THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO SELECT A PRIORITY SET OF MEASURES AND WE'RE TALKING PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN TWELVE FIFTEEN MAX. CERTAINLY AND REPORTED OTHER ENTITIES SUCH AS THC HAS COVERED CALIFORNIAN CALPERS. WHAT'S THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THIS IS LIKELY- WILL INCLUDE A SUBSET OF QUALITY MEASURES AS A SAD COLLECTED BY HEALTH PLANS INCLUDING HEALTH CARE EFFECTIVENESS DATA AND INFORMATION SET MEASURES ARE HE JUST MEASURES AND CONSUMER SATISFACTION SURVEY SURVEYS SUCH AS THE CONSUMER ASSESSMENT OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND SYSTEMS SURVEY CAPS SURVEY. THE MEASURES NAY ALSO INCLUDE THOSE CONDITIONS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OR OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND COULD INCLUDE A MIX OF CHILD AN ADULT MEASURES. SOME EXAMPLES OF POTENTIAL MEASURES IMPROPRIETIES FOR OLD FOR FRESHER CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING ASAMOAH. PRENATAL AND POSTPARTUM CARE OPIOID USE IMMUNIZATIONS AND DEPRESSION SCREENING. SOME EXAMPLES OF CONSUMER SATISFACTION SURVEY QUESTION INCLUDE THOSE RELATED TO CONSUMER EXPERIENCES OBTAINING NECESSARY AND TIMELY CARE ACCESS TO CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE CARE HEALTH PLAN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ABILITY TO RECEIVE SPECIAL TREATMENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. A FULL SERVICE IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH PLANS WILL MAKE ALCOHOL MODIFICATIONS FOR QUALITY ASSURANCEPROGRAM POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND ANNUALLY COLLECT AND SUBMIT A REPORT COMPETING TAKING DATA AND INFORMATION ON THE PRIORITY SET OF MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS TO THE DEAL MAKES THE BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY OR PERMISSION YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY. THREE SOME OF THE QUESTION FOR THIS TO OF THE ACTIONS DEPARTMENT WOULD EXPECT OF HEALTH PLANS AS THEY SEEK TO COMPLY WITH THE EQUITY QUALITY MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS. I'M SO HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS DO NOT DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS. FOR THE HEALTHCARE SERVICE PLAN TO IMPLEMENT ACTION PLANS TO ACHIEVE AND DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE HEALTH HEALTH EQUITY IN QUALITY STANDARD MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS. ADDITIONAL ACT EXPECTATIONS MAY INCLUDE THE HEALTH PLAN IDENTIFYING ROOT CAUSES OF FAILURE TO MEET THE BENCHMARK STANDARDS. CONDUCTING OUTREACH TO THEIR CONTRACTOR PROVIDERS ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS EFFECTIVENESS OF PAYMENT AND SENATE AND SAID INCENTIVES FOR OTHER INTERVENTIONS AND MAKING CHANGES AS NECESSARY- WE ALSO CAN REQUIRE PROVIDER PLANS TO SUBMIT MORE FREQUENT REPORTING AS PART OF OUR MONITORING. OF RESPECT PROCESS. IN THE FINAL QUESTION NUMBER HERE IS AFTER THE REQUIRE PUBLICATION REGULATIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN THE STATE MAKES THE EXPECT TO HAVE TO PROMULGATE NEW REGULATIONS WHEN EQUITY IN QUALITY MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY. SO THIS IS A TOUGH ONE I WILL. DEPARTMENT TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND AVOID POTENTIAL LEGAL CHALLENGES WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL NEED TO CODIFY THE MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS AND REGULATIONS- WE WILL NEED TO AMEND THE REGULATIONS IF WE MAKE CHANGES TO THOSE BENCHMARKS. OR MEASURES- WE INTEND TO RE EVALUATE AND MAKE CHANGES TO THE EQUITY IN QUALITY MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS AS NECESSARY- A REALLY GOING TO AND INTO THIS WITH AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THERE IS A LOT THAT WILL CHANGE AS WE START TO COLLECT THIS DATA BOTH IN THE MEASURES AND THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF HEALTH EQUITY- IT'LL BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO. CONTINUALLY RE EVALUATE AND WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING APPROPRIATE CHANGES- TO THE MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS SAYS BUT TECHNOLOGY IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM INVOLVES BUT WILL NEED TO CODIFY THAT. IN A MINUTE BUT REGULATIONS. I THINK THE QUESTION THAT ARE FORMAL BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKING COURSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING FOR THE APARTMENT FINANCE. THANK YOU NO COMMENTS OKAY THE L. A. O. MADAM CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS AB IN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY NOTE THAT WE SUPPORT THE GOALS THAT UNDERLIE THIS BCP AND SPECIFICALLY FIND THAT MEASURING AND REPORTING IN HOLDING PLANS. RESPONSIBLE FOR MEETING FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE AGAINST QUALITY IN EQUITY STANDARDS- CAN DRIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE RECOGNIZE THAT CARRYING OUT THESE NEW ACTIVITIES OUT ROOF WOULD REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING FOR DMH SEE AND DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE RESOURCE REQUEST OR THE ASSOCIATED- PROPOSED STATUTORY CHANGES AND JUST RECOMMEND CONTINUED LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS AS THEY DEVELOP THAT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. AND AS THEY DEVELOP THE PROCESSES FOR MONITORING REPORTING AND ENFORCING THOSE STANDARDS THANK YOU. IN YOU VERY MUCH AND I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTIONS WOULD BE AROUND- WELL AGAIN THAT A TECHNOLOGY AND THINKING YOU FOR YOU WORK WITH US. BUT ALSO THEN- AGAIN JUST THE IDEA OF EQUITY AROUND REGIONALLY AROUND THE STATE JUST IF WE CAN KEEP THAT IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS. AND WHAT WHAT IS YOUR PLAN THEN FOR MAINTAINING. I MEAN IT IT'S GONNA BE COLLECTING A LOT OF DATA SITTING ON A BENCH MARKS. OR ARE WE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT. I GUESS HOW DO THANK HEAVENS TO KEEP SAYING IS HOW DO WE AVOID THE- ADD TO BUCKLE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT I. T. AND THEN DATA COLLECTION. AND START THERE PLEASE. NO I AND I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW COLLECTING HE DOES STATE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THE PLANS ARE ALREADY REPORTING AGAIN WITH THIS IDEA THAT WE'RE NOT- YOU KNOW CREATING A NEW SET OF MEASURES THIS IS REALLY BUILT AROUND- IDENTIFY MEASURES THAT ARE ALREADY BEING COLLECTED AND REPORTED TO PURCHASERS AND OTHER STATE ENTITIES AND SO- THIS IS NOT- IN TERMS OF LIKE SUBMITTING THE DATA THIS IS NOT HUGE HUGE DATABASES- THIS IS DATA THAT CAN BE- JUST SUBMITTED AN AGGREGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT FAIRLY SIMPLY- SO AGAIN ALREADY DATA THAT'S BEING COLLECTED AND REPORTED BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SOMEONE HOW WE DEAL WITH THE OTHER DATA THAT WE COLLECT. AND CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ONE OF THE AS ONE OF MY OTHER HATCHES OF MOISTURE THE LGBT CAUCUS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE COLLECTION I WAS THE LACK OF COLLECTION OF UP SO G. DATA AND THEN BUT THE LACK OF REPORTING THAT OR DOCUMENTING THAT SOMEWHERE I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE EQUITY FACTORS MIXED IN AS WELL OR INCLUDED AS WELL. NO NOT THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A PRIORITY FOR US AS WELL I WILL SAY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE OVERALL IN DATA COLLECTION IS WEEK WE DON'T HAVE- YOU KNOW COMPLETE ROBUST STATE ON BOTH RACE ETHNICITY OBVIOUSLY SO G. DATE AS WELL- AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT WE CAN LOOK AT YOU KNOW GEOGRAPHY ANOTHER PROXIES. IT'S AN AREA THAT WE REALLY WILL BE LOOKING TO BOTH OUR SISTER AGENCIES ALL BUT ALSO THE COMMITTEE TO ADVISE US ON HOW DO WE CAPTURE THAT DATA HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT MISSING OUT ON CERTAIN COMMUNITIES- THIS IS ANOTHER AREA THAT I THINK WE ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT AS TIME GOES BY ANDTHE AVAILABILITY OF THAT DATA WILL IMPROVE. AND THIS IS WHERE OUR ABILITY TO BE NIMBLE MEN MOVE AND MAKE CHANGES TO THOSE MEASURES AND THE BENCHMARKS WILL BE IMPORTANT OKAY AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE USING THIS. DATA TO AT. INCREASED EQUITY AND USE IT FOR PER. HOW WHAT IS IT WHAT IS THE I. ABOUT THE RELATION BACK WITH THE LATEST AS FAR AS REPORTING THIS DATA SO WE CAN MAIN WE CAN BE AWARE OF WHERE THE GAPS ARE OF- WHICH PROVIDERS ARE ARE BEING ABLE TO MEET THE OUTCOMES. AND WHAT WHAT'S YOUR IDEA ABOUT COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR UPDATES AND REPORTS. SURE KNOWING WHERE WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO PROVIDE UPDATES- ON ON THE WORK THAT WE DO- I THINK THE KEY PIECE YEAR ROUND TRANSPARENCY WILL BE THE ANNUAL REPORT THAT WE WILL HAVE ON OUR WEBSITE SO OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT STARTING AT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE IT'LL BE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. THAT WILL WHO WILL SHOW HOW THE PLANS ARE DOING IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE AND MEETING THOSE BENCHMARKS. THANK YOU DOCTOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- IT. AND YES CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND- AND ENSURE YOUR DESIRE NOT TO INCREASE IN MISTER BURDENS ON PLANTS WERE REPORTING A LOT OF DATA TO THE DEPARTMENT AND TO OUR STATE GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER I THINK IF WE'RE DEALING WITH EQUITY- WE HAD WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE NOW- IT DID COME FROM THIS YOU KNOW- THE FIRST IS A SYSTEMIC RACISM IT'S NICE BUILT INTO OUR SYSTEM SO I THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT OUR EXISTING DATA SYSTEMS. DATA COLLECTION AND LOOK AT WHERE THINGS WERE NOT COLLECTING THAT WE PERHAPS SHOULD BE SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO STICK THE THINGS YOU'RE A YET BUT I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT PEN ON THERE NOT TO SAY THAT LET'S GO IN TO CREATE A WHOLE BUNCH OF NEW MEASURES- BUT I DO THINK THAT'S- SO BUT THE ONE PLACE I THINK WE REALLY DO NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WORK WITH THE PLANS BUT- BUT BEFORE WE GET REALLY. GOOD INACCURATE DATA IS AROUND THE BENEFICIARIES THEMSELVES BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT ALL THE REST OF IT YOU CAN'T REALLY INTERPRET SO FOR EXAMPLE ARE WE DO WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO CONFIDENTIALLY AND ACTUALLY AT LEAST TRY TO COLLECT DATA ON- YOU KNOW- SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY RIGHT. BECAUSE IT BASICALLY IF THERE ISN'T A MECHANISM DO THAT THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THAT AND THEN I THINK FOR THE API COMMUNITY HAVING A DISAGGREGATED DATA SO YOU KNOW THAT IT'S MENTION THAT. THE EIGHTY I CAN BE REPRESENTS PEOPLE COME FROM THE BIGGEST COTTON IN THE WORLD THE BIGGEST OCEAN IN THE WORLD THERE'S A LOT OF DIVERSITY WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY AND SO IF YOU DON'T GET THE- DISAGGREGATED DATA. GOING TO MISS A LOT THINGS THERE- SO. I IS SO. SOME NOT SURE THE CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE ADEQUATE ENOUGH AND THAT THERE IS IF WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO ACHIEVE EQUITY. WE NEED TO. DEMAND THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE BETTER IN TERMS OF THAT THAT BASELINE DATA BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE HEATERS AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE- PARTS OUT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE L. G. B. T. Q. DATA. YOU DON'T HAVE THE DISAGGREGATED AGI DAYS SIMPLY SAY LIKE ASIANS ARE DOING FINE AND THAT CETERA BUT IT COULD BE THAT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THE PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE DOING SO WELL FACT WE SEE THIS WITH OPEN RIGHT OPPOSITE GUY ANDERS ACTUALLY HAVE THE HIGHEST DEATH RATE OF ANY. GROUP BUT IF WE JUST FOLDED THE MEN AS A TI. FELLOW BEEN LOST SO. SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. IN AN ECHO FRAMEWORK THAT. NOT SAY THAT WELL WHAT WE HAVE IS GOOD ENOUGH WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AND COLLECTING AT LEAST. SOME OF THE DATA. THE OTHER THING THAT I ALSO WANT TO MENTION IS THE EDITIONS OF COURSE TO THE DATA YOU COLLECT IS ALSO- HOW YOU ANALYZE EXISTING DATA SO LET ME JUST POSE THIS QUESTION- WELL THE LATEST BEFORE BECAUSE THIS QUESTION- I ALSO WANNA GET BACK TO CERTAINLY FOR THE API COMMUNITY BUT- AS FOR OTHER. MUSIC COLOR- IT. ACCESS TO INTERPRETERS ALL RIGHT Y. SE INTERPRETERS I MEAN YOU KNOW NOT JUST TRANSLATION. ALL RIGHT NOT JUST A PHONE PERSON SO ARE WE GONNA BE COLLECTING DATA ON ACCESS TO INTERPRETER TO LET INTERPRETERS MEDICAL INTERPRETERS AND- AND OF SAMPLE PERCENTAGE OF TIMES THAT HAPPENED AND SO FORTH SO IT'S NOT JUST LIKE A CALL THE PHONE THING WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO LITERALLY TRANSLATES AND CAN'T AND SO YOU YOU DON'T GET THE CULTURAL CONTACTED CETERA. ARE WE GOING TO BE COLLECTING THAT INFORMATION AS FAR AS EQUITY EFFORT. NO I JUST ON THE COLLECTING OF RACE ETHNICITY AND SO G. DATA- YOU KNOW HAVING. TO WORK ON THIS THROUGHOUT MY CAREER THERE'S ALWAYS THIS TRYING TO FIND THIS BALANCE FROM TRYING TO CAPTURE THE DATA TO DO THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT- WITHOUT CREATING A BARRIER TO ENROLLMENT AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE WILL. CONTINUE TO WORK ON- IN PARTICULAR- WORKING WITH PURCHASERS WHO WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS AS WELL- IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO TRANSLATOR SERVICES THAT THIS PROBLEM. HM THAT'S A INTERPRETER SIR. THERE'S ACTUALLY A DIFFERENCE. CANCELLATION CANCELLATION IS DIFFERENT THAN INTERPRETING TRANSLATION IS CAN JUST BE A LITERAL TRANSLATION I'LL TELL YOU AS SOMEONE WHO'S A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER A LITERAL TRANSLATION WELL MORE HELPFUL THAN NOTHING DOESN'T INCLUDE THE CULTURAL CONTEXT OF THE INTERACTION. AND SO IT'S NOT AS USEFUL THAT'S WHY USE MEDICAL INTERPRETERS. NOT JUST TRANSLATORS. SURE NO I AND I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY THERE IS PROBABLY THROUGH SOME SORT OF CONSUMER SATISFACTION SURVEY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE MEMBER EXPERIENCE FOR EXAMPLE- I ASSUME THE CODE FOR THIS BECAUSE USUALLY IT SHOULD BE OFTEN AND EXPENSE SO IT'S OUR WAY WE CAN COLLECTED ASIDE FROM JUST ASKING THAT. PATIENTS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AROUND DOUBLE PAYMENT HOW MAY I HELP YOU CAN HELP ME OUT FOR A MID STATE PAY FORWARD THE NAME I MEAN THAT THAT'S A LEVEL OF ACCESS. I WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE THAT BACK AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH OUR COMMITTEE ABOUT OKAY SO CERTAINLY I APPRECIATE CATCHING IT ON THE CONSUMER AND I AND I ALWAYS RECOMMEND I THINK IN OUR CONVERSATION THE PAST OF THE SURVEY TO CONSUMERS AS WELL. THIS CASE IS WILL REVERSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE CONSUMER INFORMATION PERHAPS SOME CAPS AND AGAIN THAT'S IN THE SAMPLE. GOING BACK THE OTHER WAY HI YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO GET COMPARISONS TO. THE WHAT TO WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PAYING FOR AND HOW OFTEN YOU'RE PAYING FOR SAID IT CENTER AND THEN OF COURSE IS TIED TO KNOWING BASS FISHERY BUT ALSO PERHAPS ALSO SOME GEOGRAPHIC DATA RIGHT. SO YOU KNOW THE LIVING IN AN AREA THAT HAS A HIGH DENSITY AT CETERA. AS TO IF ONE PLAN ISN'T PAYING FOR VERY MUCH AND THE OTHER ONE IS. THERE MIGHT BE TELLING YOU SOMETHING. OKAY SO AGAIN I THINK THAT CERTAINLY FOR THE H. E. I. CAN ME THIS CAN BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- BUT I IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE OF DATA I THINK YOU NEED TO BE LOOKING AT FROM ANALYTICAL STANDPOINT SO YOU KNOW YOU DO GET DATA ON. WHICH PROVIDERS THE CONTRACT AND YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND SO FORTH SO YOU GET THAT INFORMATION. BUT ARE WE GONNA DO ANALYSES. AND ALSO SENSE OF THE BENEFICIARIES AND WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED SO GEOGRAPHIC IT'S CETERA. BUT ARE WE GONNA LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE- AND- IT TO THE GREED THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE LOCATED. IN AND LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES BECAUSE UP THAT'S HOW YOU ONE WAY IF I DON'T WANT TO HIRE EXPENSE AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT EQUITY IS I JUST BASE ALL MY- DOCTORS OFFICES PHARMACIES YOU KNOW HOSPITALS AND IN MIDDLE CLASS UPPER MIDDLE CLASS IT'S CETERA COMMUNITIES AND SAY FINE I'M WILLING TO SELL YOU A HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN. BUT YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN A POOR COMMUNITY YOU JUST GONNA HAVE TO TAKE TWO BUSES AND WHATEVER ELSE TO GET THERE. AND SO I MAKE IT MUCH LESS CONVENIENT SO- THAN OTHER EQUITY MEASURE IS TO SEE EXACTLY DO YOU HAVE PROVIDERS IN WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING DOCTORS ON TALKING PHARMACIES AND TALK ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES. YOU KNOW A DEBTOR LOCATED IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AFTER ALL WE HAVE WE HAVE TO EASE DIVIDED BY THESE I FORGOT WHAT THE NAMES OF THE THESE QUARTILES FOR. HELP SO WHEN WE DO WE HAVE MEASURES- THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY SO HE SHOULD SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE'S A- SOLDIER FIGHTING HEALTH INSURANCE YOU KNOW EVEN. IF THERE'S ONLY HEALTH INSURANCE RT RT BASICALLY INTENTIONALLY JUST CONTRACTING WITH PEOPLE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES TO AVOID. HAVING ENCOURAGING. BEEN OFFICIALLY SIGNING UP FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS AS YOU KNOW- WE DO HAVE QUITE A ROBUST DATABASE ON. WORKSITE. MEDICAL PLANS NETWORK SO. IT IS LIKELY THAT I DO THINK THERE'S AN OP. VERTICALLY AS WE AT HER ACTION PLAN TO TRY TO. REALLY TRY TO INTO THE CAUSE- AND THERE AN OP. FOR US TO KNOW KIND OF A LINE THE WITH THE OTHER AREA OF WORK AT THE DEAL MAKES THE- ARE. ACT OUT OKAY. REFUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE DATA FOR NETWORK. BUT ALSO. PERHAPS OKAY DEVELOP THE ANALYTICAL CAPACITY TO LOOK AT ALSO FROM AN EQUITY LINES AND PROVIDE REPUBLIC REPORTS ABOUT THAT. AND THEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THEN TO. COUNTY THROUGH YOUR AGENCY DIRECTLY BUT ALSO THROUGH- OTHER MEANS TO. ENCOURAGE PLANS TO HAVE MORE EQUITABLE EFFORTS IN TERMS OF- THEIR NETWORKS I MEAN NOT JUST AND IT'S NOT THE NETWORK ITSELF IT'S ACTUALLY WHO. YOU KNOW WHO WHO. ACTUALLY HAS ACCESS TO THE PLAN ITSELF. RIGHT ANY BECAUSE OF DRUGS YOU KNOW LOCATING A NEIGHBORHOOD YOU DON'T HAVE A PHARMACY THERE ETCETERA. YES SO YOU TRAVEL YOU'LL FIND THE DOCTOR DOCTOR WRITES A PRESCRIPTION NOW YOU CAN'T FIND A PHARMACY THAT SEND YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD SO EVERY TIME YOU DO RESELL YOU GOTTA GO TAKE ANOTHER LONG TRIP IT'S ADDRESS SO. THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO SCOURGE FOR SOMEONE FROM SIGNING UP FOR YOUR FOR THAT PLAN RIGHT. THAT'S NOT EQUITABLE. SO WE CAN TAKE A LOOK IT'S ALL ABOUT ANALYSIS SO THAT'S DATA YOU'RE COLLECTING BUT LET'S DO IT LET'S DO THE ANALYTICS FOR THAT OKAY LET'S THAT JUST SOME IDEAS SO THROUGHOUT THEIR EXPLAINS MORE BUT I'LL- I'LL STOP THERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON THEN TO- ONE OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. HELLO HELLO PUBLIC HEALTH. HI THIS IS SUSAN VALLEY ON THE CHIEF DEPUTY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE PROVIDING THE UPDATE TODAY WE WELCOME YOU VERY MUCH YOU CAN PROVIDE US AN UPDATE BEFORE WE GO TO OUR PANELISTS. OKAY SO ON THE COVERAGE FRONT WE HAVE TODAY REPORTED ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE NEW CASES BRINGING OUR TOTAL ARGUMENT OF TOTAL TO THREE POINT SIX MILLION CASES ARE ARE EFFECTIVE DATE RANGES FROM ZERO POINT EIGHT EIGHT TWO ZERO POINT EIGHT NINE AS YOU KNOW OUR CASE NUMBERS ARE TEST POSITIVE GET READY AND HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE STABLE AT AND OR DECREASING ACROSS THE STATE. OUR CASE NUMBER PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS AT FOUR POINT ONE WITH A SEVEN DAY AVERAGING SEVEN DAY LAG ON OUR THAT COMPARES TO THE PREVIOUS COUPLE OF MONDAYS IN TERMS OF NEW CASES WHICH WERE- FOURTEEN FORTY FIVE- TWO MONDAYS AGO ON FOUR TWENTY SIX IN SIXTEEN OH SIX- ON FOUR NINETEEN SO AGAIN LOOKING BETTER IN TERMS OF LOST NUMBER OF CASES ARE HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE ALSO MUCH LOWER THAN. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND HAVE STABILIZED WITH- ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX NEW EMISSIONS EVERY DAY BUT THE NUMBERS OF HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE WELL BELOW WHERE WE WERE ON IN OCTOBER BEFORE THE HEALTHCARE SEARCH I'M SO MORTALITY WE HAD TWO NEW DEATHS REPORTED TODAY BRINGING OUR STATEWIDE TOTAL TO SIXTY THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE. OUR NUMBER OF TESTS REPORTED OUR 480-008-0040 NINE TODAY BURKINA THAT NUMBER OF TESTS ACROSS A LOT OF THAT PANDEMIC AT SIXTY MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY OUR SEVEN DAY POSITIVITY OTHER. AT ONE POINT 1% AND I PICKED UP ON THE BACKS FRONT WE HAVE A MINISTER A TOTAL OF MILLION. FIVE HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN VACCINE DOSES- THAT MEANS ABOUT ROUGHLY CALIFORNIANS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE. HOWEVER THAT'S NOT THE SAME ACROSS THE- STATE WITH ONLY 47% OF PEOPLE IN ON THE QUARTILE ONE OR LOWEST EQUITY QUARTILE COMPARED 270% IN Q. TO Q. FOUR WHICH IS OUR HIGHEST- HEALTHY PLACES IN NEXT COURT TRIAL SO. AGAIN SEEING- SOME DISPARITY ACROSS THE STATE AND- I'M GREAT WE'VE ALSO BEGUN TO SEE A- SLOWDOWN IN THE OPTIC AND CANCELLING APPOINTMENTS AND SO WE ARE LOOKING OUT THAT ACROSS THE STATE AND LOOKING AT WAYS OF INCREASING. ON THE INTEREST IN GETTING VACCINATED BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED AND MOVING AWAY FROM. I'M PLEASED VACCINATION SITES NOT THAT WE DON'T STILL NEED SOME OF THOSE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MOVE OUR VACCINATIONS TO SITES WHERE PEOPLE ARE FREQUENT- PLACES THAT ARE MORE TRUSTED SUCH AS SCHOOL CAMPUSES GROCERY STORES. A WHOLE HOST OF PLACES WHERE THAT MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER AND MORE CONVENIENT FOR PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED IF I COULD INTERRUPT YOU JUST ONE SECOND TO DISHONOR- PREVIOUS MEETING. WITH THE GOVERNOR- HE SAID LAST FOR FIVE DAYS HAVE BEEN STARTLING THE DROP OFF SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE TRACKING THAT ARE YOU ALSO TRACKING IN THAT FROM. AN EQUITY STANDPOINT AS FAR AS- WHAT WHO WHO'S NOT COMING BACK ON WHO'S NOT WHO'S NOT GETTING VACCINATED WHO IS THAT SIMILAR TO THE EARLIER THE NUMBER SHE GAVE. IT IS SIMILAR- I THINK WE'VE SEEN AND READ DECLINE ACROSS THE BOARD IN ALL FOUR COUNTS OF THE STATE. I'M BUT I THINK AND IN FACT AND I THINK THAT GAP BETWEEN Q. FOUR AND Q. ONE HAS REDUCED A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY IT'S JUST A REFLECTION OF REDUCTIONS ACROSS THE BOARD. AND VACCINE. HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE ARE WE ARE STILL. MAKING GREAT PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD IN VACCINATIONS AND WE WERE HOPING THAT IT'S A SLIGHT DOWNTURN GIVEN THAT POTS ON THE J. AND J. RACKS THE SOME OF THE OTHER- PROSAUROPOD IN SO WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN WERE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY EAST YOU. SHARE BEST PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING CREATIVE- BREALEY WORKING OUT WAYS TO GET PEOPLE MORE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTAND. THE SAFETY OF THE VACCINES. THANK YOU. I'M CAUGHT THIS IS THIRTY FIFTH WEEK THE BLUEPRINTS- FOR A SAFER ECONOMY WE HAVE FIVE COUNTIES THAT MOVED TO A LESS RESTRICTIVE HERE THIS WEEK FROM RED TO ORANGE WE HAD INYO COUNTY WHICH BRED BEING SUBSTANTIAL DISEASE AN ORANGE BEING MODERATE DISEASE WE HAD- THREE COUNTIES MOVED FROM ORANGE TO YELLOW WHICH IS FROM MODERATE TO MINIMAL- LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO AND TRINITY SO ALL THOSE FIVE COUNTIES MOVED TO A LESS RESTRICTIVE HERE AS YOU KNOW OUR CURTAINS CURRENT STATS OVERALL THE STATE THERE'S ZERO IN WIDESPREAD PROPOSED HERE AND THERE ARE TWELVE COUNTIES IN SUBSTANTIAL THERE THIRTY NINE COUNTIES IN MODERATE AND SEVEN COUNTIES AND MINIMAL SO. DEFINITELY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE GONNA HIT THE GYM JUNE FIFTEENTH DEADLINE- WE ARE SURE GOING TO TRY AND SO I THINK WE ARE- LOOKING AT OPEN YOU KNOW- OPENING THE STATE ON JUNE FIFTEENTH AS THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE VACCINATED- SO THAT AS WE BEGIN TO OPEN UP THE STATE THAT WE REALLY DO HAVE A AND A LOT OF PROTECTION OUT THERE TO KEEP THE TRANSMISSION FROM MOVING FORWARD. I AM SO I THINK THE NEXT STEP I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PANDEMIC UPDATE ABOUT SORT OF A QUICK UPDATE. AND YOU WERE TO MOVE ON TO THE QUESTION THE WHOLE. OKAY SO THE NEXT ONE WAS TO YOU PLEASE PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE STATE'S COORDINATED PREVENTION AND RESPONSE ACTIVITIES WE SORT OF BUCKET THESE ACTIVITIES AND- A FEW CATEGORIES SOME ONE BEING MONITORING THE SCOPE ON PROGRESS OF THE PANDEMIC TO INFORM OUR RESPONSE. AND THAT INCLUDES ALL OF OUR SAY SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS ARE MODELING OUR ANALYSIS OF DATA TO UNDERSTAND THOSE DISPARATE IMPACTS AND OUR IT SYSTEMS ALL VERY BIG EFFORTS- IN TERMS OF THIS ONGOING PANDEMIC. WE TRY TO DEVELOP THE POLICIES THAT SUPPORT THIS MISSION TO PROVIDE A SCIENCE BASED FRAMEWORK FOR SAFE RE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY TO MINIMIZE THOSE HEALTH IMPACTS. WE DEVELOP AND PROMOTE EQUITABLE POLICIES AND RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS AND WE ALIGN PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE POLICIES INACTION WITH CHANGING SCOPES AND DEMAND. DEMANDS OF THE PANDEMIC. WE ALSO WORK TO MITIGATE AND SUPPRESSED COBIT NINETEEN DISEASE BY DIRECTING AND PREVENTING NON PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS ARE AND P. EYES TO MINIMIZE MINIMIZE ADVERSE HEALTH IMPACTS WE PROVIDE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS JUST SUPPRESSED. AND CONTAINED COVER NINETEEN WITH TESTING TRACING OR CONTRACT RACING AND ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR HELP MAKE OUTBREAK CONTROL AND CONGREGATE LIVING FACILITIES CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES WORKPLACES SCHOOLS. AND OTHER COMMUNITY SETTINGS WE DEVELOP AND PROVIDE INNOVATIVE AND EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS FOR CHANGING THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC. OF THE NEXT BUCKET IS COORDINATING AND SUPPLEMENTING STATEWIDE HEALTH CARE RESOURCES AND PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS- DEVELOPING AN ACT. IN RESPECT DEVELOP AN APP COVERT NINETY VACCINE JUST PLN. STRONGLY AND INFLUENZA VACCINATIONS TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ENHANCING INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS AND ALL OVER HEALTH CARE FACILITY SETTINGS AND MONITORING AND PROVIDING AVAILABLE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HEALTHCARE STAFF ICU BEDS AND VENTILATORS TO MEET THOSE THIRDS HEALTHCARE SERVICE DEMANDS- NEXT IS COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY TO THE PUBLIC AND ENGAGING OUR STAKEHOLDERS- INCLUDING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT SAYS ARE KEY. OUR PRIMARY PARTNERS COMMUNICATING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC TO BRIGHTEN UP TO DATE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND SCIENCE BASED EASIER UNDERSTAND INFORMATION. THAT'S ACCESSIBLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. WE PARTICIPATE IN A QUARTER COORDINATED STATE GOVERNMENT AND CJ JUST RESPONSE IN ENGAGING IN AN ALL GOVERNMENT APPROACH AS YOU KNOW THIS IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE ARE AN ALL OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO THIS- AS IT IMPACTS ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE SECTORS WITHIN THE POPULATION SO FOSTERING THAT COORDINATED MULTI AGENCY APPROACH TO- NEED THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE VARIOUS SUBGROUPS WITHIN THE POPULATION AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA AS- WE DEVELOP UNIFIED DATA SYSTEMS AND ANALYTICAL DASHBOARDS- FOR. FOR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY CONTINUE ON THAT CROSSES MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS. AND THEN WE'VE REALLY PARTNER WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE STRATEGIES. I'M AND I THINK THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE KEY AREAS OF RESPONSE THAT WE ARE. CONTINUING AND AS YOU KNOW AS ONE SORT OF WHITES DOWN ANOTHER ONE. PICKS UP AND SO AS WE ARE YEAH WE ALL STILL OBVIOUSLY SEE THE VALUE AND NOT ONLY VACCINATION BUT IN TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY- THAT. STRAINS THAT WERE USED TO SEEING AND CALIFORNIA BUT SOME OF THE. VARIANT STRAINS MATT AND WE CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT- SURROUND THOSE CASE. AND ICE CORN VOTE SO THAT WE DON'T SEE. THE VARIANT STRAINS ON GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER. THE QUESTION NUMBER THREE HAS A CURRENT- COVE IN NINETEEN RESPONSE HIGHLIGHTED ANY GAPS AND READY IN US THAT MIGHT BE- MIGHT HELP THE STATE AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC. AND YES I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE ALL RECOGNIZED AND KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME IS THAT THE CORE ASSET OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS STAFFING AND WE KNOW THAT OVER THE YEARS OF- CUTTING OF FUNDS AND- YEAH ONE TIME FUNDING SOURCES TO ADDRESS. MANY OF BALANCE THAT WE HAVE AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS- NEEDS HELP AND PRIMARILY AND STAFFING ALSO THE WORLD HAS CHANGED A LOT IN TERMS OF DATA ANALYTICS AND THE WAY THAT WE LOOK AT DATA SO I THINK WE WOULD. PUT INTO THE BUCKET OF STAFFING THAT WE NEED. BIGGER PUBLIC HEALTH AND- THAT INCLUDES MORE EPIDEMIOLOGISTS GENOMICS ON GENOMIC TESTING AND SEQUENCING MODELING- EVALUATION OF OUR INTERVENTIONS AND PARTNERING WITH ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN A BIGGER WAY. YOU'VE ALL SEEN IT PLAY OUT ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER IN TERMS OF OUR IT AND DATA SYSTEMS AND THAT WE HAVE INVESTED A LOT THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC AND WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK IN TERMS OF BUILDING. THOSE SYSTEMS THAT CAN REALLY- WITH STANDARD THE NUMBER AND THE TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT WE- NEED TO PUT I FROM TESTING TO VACCINATIONS AND I'M CONNECTING ALL OF THAT DATA. I THINK THAT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE BUILT FOR THE SCANNED THEM EXCELLENT WE ARE INDEED READY TO DEAL WITH. ANY PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE BUT ALSO ANY OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT MAY COME OUR DIRECTION I THINK WE HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE H. ONE AND ONE REPORT BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY. KEEP A LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD UP DURING H. ONE AND ONE AND- LONG ENOUGH TO. ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC. THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW SHOULD STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS APPROACH FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP DETERMINE WHERE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AS REQUIRED AND WHETHER THERE IS A NEED. TO ADDRESS FUNDING GAPS OR TO ASSESS WHAT THOSE GAPS ARE. I THINK HISTORICALLY FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH HAS INCREASED MOSTLY IN RESPONSE TO SIGNIFICANT EVENTS. AND THESE FUNDING INCREASES AS I'M SAT HAVE BEEN SHORT TERM. ONE TIME- AND HAVEN'T ALLOWED US TO BUILD SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. AND WE NEED THAT STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE TO RESPOND TO FUTURE EVENTS AS RIGHT AS WELL AS PROMOTE. OUR REGULAR HEALTH PROGRAMS. THIS FUNDING NEEDS TO ACCOUNT FOR BOTH THE INCREASING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN RESOURCES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU'VE GOT LEVEL FUNDING. OVER TIME THE COST FOR SALARIES AND BENEFITS AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS CONTINUE TO INCREASE SO YOU'RE REALLY. GETTING A REDUCTION IF YOU'RE NOT KEEPING UP WITH THOSE BENEFIT COSTS. AND THERE ARE TOOLS THAT ESTIMATE NECESSARY STAFFING LEVELS FOR AND NEED IT FOR MANY PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS- YOU KNOW WE JUST CAN USE THE EXAMPLE OF CONTACT TRACING. FIFTEEN CONTACT TRACERS FOR EVERY HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION- YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS THAT SET UP. ON HOW MANY STAFF YOU SHOULD HAVE ON A PER CAPITA ASIS. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER MODELS THAT LOOK AT. PER CAPITA SPENDING ON PUBLIC HEALTH. AND YOU KNOW MANY- COME MAKE COMPARISONS ARE FROM ACROSS THE NATION ACROSS THE WORLD ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS. IN PUBLIC HEALTH PER CAPITA. I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE UNLESS. IN ORDER ACCURATE ACCURATELY GAUGE WHETHER ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AS REQUIRED I THINK IT COULD BE HELPFUL TO DO SOME SORT OF AN ASSESSMENT PARTICULARLY. IF WE COULD DESIGN THAT IS THAT I'M- THE ASSESSMENT SUCH A WAY THAT ALLOWED FOR LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND STILL MEASURED SOME CORE CAPABILITIES OF EACH PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WE WOULD NEED TO SORT OF DO THAT THROUGH A CONTRACT I THINK- AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK AS WE ASSESS ONGOING WORKFORCE NEEDS LABOR CAPACITY CRITICAL SUPPLIES- AND WE WOULD NEED TO ENGAGE THEIR STAKEHOLDERS FROM LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. HEALTH OFFICERS LAB DIRECTORS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT THERE ARE. VERY DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT WE NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE STATUTORY RULES AND SOME OF THAT EVEN DUTY STATEMENTS THAT WE WRITE AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SOME OF THESE POSITIONS TO SEE IF THEY REALLY ARE- WARRANTED AND WHETHER THERE ARE SOME WAYS TO YOU- GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY- TO MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS AND THE ROLES OF. THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND WHERE WE CAN USE OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS OR MAY WANT TO- EXPAND. THE ROLE OF SOME OF THOSE OTHER FOLKS AND OF MEAT COMMUNITY NEEDS. I'M IN TERMS PUBLIC. THE NOT NOT QUESTION VERSION WHAT SEVEN. IN OUR HEALTH FIRST WOULD BE OF. THERE'S NATIONAL FREE MORE THAT I. SHE ATKINS. AS WELL AS THAT OF. ARE IN FOR OF REALLY LOOKING AT THE WAY THAT WE- KIND OF. UNDERSTAND WHAT IS PUBLIC HEALTH AND WHAT ARE THE CAPABILITIES THAT PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS TO HAVE- IT'S A NATIONAL MODEL IT LOOKS AT THAT KIND OF. THE SEVEN CORE CAPABILITIES OF A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT- THE OTHER ABILITY TO ASSESS AND SURVEY ALL OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT. COMMUNICATIONS COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMPETENCIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT THAT WAS NOT CORPS FRAMEWORK ALLOWS YOU TO DO OTHER PRESS ANY OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND IF YOU HAVE A AND- GOOD RESOURCES IN EACH OF THOSE BUCKETS YOU CAN ALSO READ DIRECT STAFF TO YOU WHATEVER IT MEANT. NEW WEST ADVANTAGE MIGHT BE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A PANDEMIC AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF THAT ALSO SHOULD IT INVOLVES SOME CROSS TRAINING AND SAM. AND IT'S REALLY HARD WHEN YOU HAVE CATEGORICAL FUNDING IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER TO DO AND THAT CROSS TRAINING BUT WE DO BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE IN THAT AND PARTNERING- ON THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. ADDRESS THE NEXT AND THE NEXT BIG THING- AN EQUITY APPROACH WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT- THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC OF THOSE THAT ARE. I'M MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED WE KNOW THAT ALL OF PUBLIC HEALTH REALLY IT HAS ABOUT. THE ADDRESSING THE DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES IN THE IN THE STATE IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH YOU HAVE TO GET TO. SOME OF THE ROOT CAUSES BUT- MAKE FOR PEOPLE AND MAKE THE- RESULT IN- LAST HEALTH FOR PEOPLE- THE RECALLS ARE HISTORICAL AND STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES INCLUDING RACISM. DISCRIMINATION SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES THE IMPACT EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION ACT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES HOUSING HAVE THEIR SONS AND ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS AND ENVIRONMENTS. THESE CHRONIC STRESSES AND TRAUMA AND EXPOSURES ADVERSELY. IMPACT THAN OR DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN IN AN IMPACT BRAINS AND- THROUGHOUT THER LIFE. AND THAT RESULT IN HIGHER RATES OF CHRONIC DISEASE MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE AND SO WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND PHYSICAL MENTAL IMPACTS. OF NOT ONLY. THE SYSTEM BUT ALSO OF THIS PANDEMIC AND THAT'S BEEN HAD IN AN ENORMOUS AND LONG LASTING IMPACT THAT WE DON'T YET UNDERSTAND. AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE THAT CHALLENGE OVER PROMOTING AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY IS A LONG TERM ENDEAVOR AND WE NEED TO BE READY TO TAKE THAT ON. I AM AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE STRATEGIES ARE TO ASSESS AND MONITOR CHANGES IN THE RANGE OF CONDITIONS AND FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE IMPACTED THE PANDEMIC ESTABLISH AND EXECUTE A LONG TERM SURVEILLANCE AND HAPPY ANALYSIS PLAN. APPLY RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY MODEL TO ESTABLISH ESTABLISH THOSE POPULATION RESULT IN INDICATORS SO WE REALLY CAN MEASURE THEM OVER TIME. AND INCORPORATE A TARGETED SET OF KEY TOPICS AND STATE HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OFFER ONGOING MONITORING. ON AND YOU KNOW I THINK BACK PROBABLY AS WE'RE ALL STOCKTON. REPAIR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THE GROUP MOVE ON TO THE PANELISTS NOW BUT BEFORE WE DO HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO THE NATIONAL MODEL. I'M THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION AND I DON'T BUT I THINK WE ARE PUTTING THAT TOGETHER THE NATIONAL MODEL IS A SET OF CAPABILITIES IT IS NOT SO IT DOESN'T GO SO FAR AS TO SAY HOW MANY PEOPLE IT JUST SAYS YOU NEED TO HAVE THESE CAPABILITIES AND SO WE ARE- YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON SOME OF THIS AND WILL BE- LOOKING AT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE RECEIVED A PROPOSAL FROM G. ACTIN THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ON KIND OF HOW THEY SEE. DO YOU AGAIN THESE WITH THE SAME MODEL MIND IN THE SAME CAPABLE FOR MORE TO COME I DON'T HAVE THAT TO SHARE TODAY OKAY BUT AS A PUBLIC HEALTH FIRST PERSON IF THAT MONEY WERE NO OBJECT JUST HAVING THAT FULLY INCORPORATED INTO CALIFORNIA WOULD BE YOUR WISH. OKAY OKAY LET'S MOVE. IT SHOULD QUICK COMMENT THANK YOU THREE I WOULD MAKE NOTE. AT THIS ACTUALLY INTERESTING IN FOR LAST OF THIS OF YEAR PER THE PEN- THE BECAUSE US TO.

SO WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW THE DISEASE'S DON'T STOP AT THE BORDERS POLITICAL BORDERS SO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE A STATE THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE HAVE THE VARIOUS COUNTIES AND WE HAVE SOME CITY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH BUT WHAT IS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THEM. RIGHT AND EVEN BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AND ALSO THE OTHER LOCAL DEPARTMENTS FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT WE'VE CLOSE MANY PUBLIC HEALTH LABS SO IT'S KIND OF BY THE FULL REGIONAL LIES BUT IT'S NOT PLANNED REGIONALI STRAIGHT SO COUNTY DECIDED THEY DON'T WANT A PUBLIC EVER TRY MY SON THAT KIND HAVE. AND NOW THE ACCOUNT RELY ON ANOTHER COUNTIES HEALTH RIGHT SO BE INTERESTED ONE PANEL IS TO TALK ABOUT SORT OF THIS HEALTH. WHICH WOULD YOU KNOW WE HAVE THAT'S IF ON THE FED RATE BUT THE STATE. AN THE STATE HAS ITS OWN. AND THE CAL. AND SOME OF THE COUNT HAVE A LOT. IN IN. IS REQUIRED. FOR EACH COUNTY MAINTAIN A CERTAIN. OF FOR OWN K. AS- AND THEN THE WHAT DEGREE. DO WE- AND- OF. IN WHETHER IT'S AT THE COUNTY LOW TO STAY LEVEL I WAS A PANDEMIC OF ME. SERVE Y. HUNDRED YEAR. BUT I WOULD POINT OUT WE ALWAYS HAVE AN OUTPUT. EVERY YEAR JUST ALWAYS AT LEAST ONE NOT BOTH. THING I CAN PLAY TO EVER SINGLE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO. COMPARE SO LIKE TO ALSO THE- OF. HOW WE BUILD AND SEARCH CAPACITY. THAT OFTEN IS NOT ONE. A TIME IT'S EITHER RE.

AND I SENATOR PAN I DID HEAR YOUR QUESTIONS AND IF THE CHAIR WILL ALLOW ME A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME I WILL TRY TO ADDRESS THEM WITHIN MY REMARKS. AND BUT IS ESSENTIALLY OUR COALITIONS MESSAGES THEY CAL CAN'T WAIT THE NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH. TO INVEST IN LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THESE INVESTMENTS NEED TO HAPPEN NOW AND I'D UNDERSCORE MUCH OF WHAT MR ELLIE SHARED REGARDING THE NEEDS- AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED WENT HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OF KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THE DISAPPEAR UNDER OF HEALTH OR STAY I'M PREPARED TO ADDRESS A PANDEMIC SUCH AS THEIR- AND TWENTY. SENATOR P. YOU CHAIRED AT THE SENATE COMMITTEE INFORMATION HEARING ON HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND COULD ADD CAPACITY. DURING THAT HEARING A PUBLIC HEALTH LAB DIRECTOR AND THIS I THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH LAB PLAY IN OUR- AND- TO EMERGING. AND PROVIDING TIE INCOME. TESTING AND DURING THAT HEARING SHE GOT THAT NOT LABS PUBLIC HEALTH LAB TO CLOSE IN THE PRIOR TEN YEARS DUE TO A OF FUNDING. AND I BELIEVE ME I'LL JUST THE- WE NEEDED OR ANDY SYSTEM AND HIGHLY THE NEED ADDITIONAL. IN TECH SYSTEMS AND STAFF. A PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECT IDENTIFY THE LACK OF SUSTAINABLE FLEXIBLE. AND I DON'T THAT IS A KEEP TO DRAW THE BIRD OF CHRONIC DISEASE- AND THE DISK. IMPACT ON COMMUNITY OF COLOR. ANOTHER HEALTH DIRECTOR NOTED THAT HEALTH INCLUDING DOT. NURSES AT THE D. LEVERAGE IN- AND DISEASE INVEST. ARE OTHERS ARE THE MOST CA. OF A HER. I THAT TIME SHE THAT LOW HEALTH TO DID HAVE THE- NEEDED TO RESPOND TO A LARGE. ALONG TERM IN THE- AND URSULA. CONSIDER FONG INVEST AND HOW HEALTH AND- JUST DRINKING THE LOCAL COULD. WILL DID WE KNOW THEN KOBE NINETEEN WHICH AROUND THE- WELL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE IS. BETTER FUNDING I'M GOING COHEN. S. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE FINDINGS THE THIS FUNDING SO SPECIFIC AND CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS. CRITICAL THAT AS STDS ARE DISEASE AND IS SUPPORT THE DATA WORK OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO. BE THE NINETEEN. AND THIS IS WHY ON. SO FLEXIBLE ISN'T. THE CAN'T WE KHALILI IS USED. ARE TO. NINETY ONGOING GENERAL FOR COLOR HEALTH WORK AND I INTEREST NEEDS. AND JUST UNDER THREE FIVE AND FOR IN A- OF PUBLIC HEALTH RIGHT INTO. AS RECALL BY EIGHTY FORTY. IN SAN JUAN. THIS MEANS FUND TO STAFF MOBILE IN THE- CLINICS FOR. HAVE C. AND HER TEXAS ALLOW PUBLIC HEALTH TO REACH THEM WATER NEIGHBORHOOD SUCH AS- AND HOMELESS. IN SACRAMENTO THIS FUNDING INCREASED CAPACITY TO INVEST. SCREENING CAN COMING DISEASE SUCH AS- AND RIVERSIDE THIS FUNDING TO EXPAND OF COMING. DISEASE INVESTING. AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT IN TWENTY ONE RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAD THE SAME NUMBER OF CA. DID INVEST. THAT HAD IN THE- EIGHTIES DESPITE THE GROWING PART. FOR OTHER JURISTIC ACROSS THE STATE IN NEED TO BAN. WE WORK. CHRONIC DISEASE AND INTERVENTION SIX PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE COME. PROGRAMS AMONGST OTHER BY. TO COMMUNITY. AND WE CAN'T WORK THE SITE OF HEALTH. WHICH NEW YORK UP AT CHARACTER I AS NICKEL. PANICKING OR P. AND SENATOR CAN'T ADDRESS SOME YOUR- ABOUT THE ROLE OF REAL. AND ACCOUNT IN THE STATE AND FOR UP WITH. FOR TO FIND PUBLIC HEALTH. AT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO RECEIVE. NINETY ONE RELY. AID ONE OF THAT FUNDS FUNDING SOURCES LOCAL DRESSED. HAVE AND JURISTIC. AT COUNTIES IN AND AS- THAT THIS. THREE CITIES ME ALL PUT UP AND WILL I AM. ATTY OTHER AND ALL I MEAN IT'S A FOR X. ME. IN THE- CON AROUND REALIGN WAS THAT. WE WOULD BUT THERE WAS OF FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD BE REAL LIKE REAL. TO THIS IS REALLY NOT MEETING THAT OBLIGATION AND I SHOULD ALSO SAY THAT. I'M IN TERMS OF STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING AS ISN'T WE ALL PROBABLY KNOW HAT WE'VE SEEN IS. THAT FUNDING COMING DOWN BASED ON THE DISEASE. SO EACH ONE ADELINE ABLE AS HE GOT WEST NILE LIKE THEIR BUCKETS OF FUNDING BUT THE REAL CHALLENGES THAT IT PROHIBITS US TO LOOK ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT AND REALLY ADDRESSED THINGS HOLISTICALLY. AND KEEPS OUR DEPARTMENTS IN THESE INDIVIDUAL FUNDING CYCLES. AND THEN IN TERMS OF SURGE CAPACITY WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS- THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND REALLY THAT THE- KEY CHALLENGES HAVING THE STAFF ON HAND AND MANY OF OUR DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC TURNED INTO. CULVER DEPARTMENTS FOR LACK OF BETTER TERMS WHERE. MANY OF THE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAD TO BE SATISFIED AND PUT ON HOLD WHICH CREATES- EVEN MORE CHALLENGES RATE STD RATES HAVE GROWN. YOU KNOW WAS IT TREMENDOUSLY DURING THIS TIME. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE AND SO HAVING MORE STAFF THAT COULD BE FLEXIBLE THAT WE CAN USE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT OUTBREAKS AND PUBLIC HEALTH THAT'S THAT WE WILL SEE. AND CONTINUE TO FACE WOULD BE HELPFUL I'M AND IT WOULD HELP THE SEARCH CAPACITY BUT RIGHT NOW OUR OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT STAFFING. HAS HAS SHRUNK BY 2224% IN TERMS OF WORK FORCE AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT HAVING. SEARCH CAPACITY ON HAND HAS BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR US. AND SO THIS IS WHY WE ARE YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THAT THE SENATE DEMOCRATS INCLUDED PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEIR PRIORITIES AND WE'RE ASKING- THAT YOU SUPPORT OUR REQUEST FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION ON GOING PUBLIC. I HAD GENERAL FUND FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE WE NEED PEOPLE. AND THE MOST BENEFICIAL THING THAT WE COULD HAVE HAD THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC IS PEOPLE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MOVED IN TRANSITION. AND AS YOU KNOW AND AS YOU STATED CENTER PAN WEEK WE PROBABLY WILL NOT HAVE THIS PANDEMIC OF THIS MAGNITUDE IN THE NEXT. YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY MANY MANY YEARS BUT WE WILL HAVE OTHER LESSER. CHALLENGES THAT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL NEED TO FACE AND SO WE SHOULD ALSO EVALUATE. WHAT IS OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. DO WE HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING RATIOS INCAPAZ. I MEAN WE HAVE INTEREST. WHERE THEY- YOU KNOW FIVE PUBLIC HEALTH. WE OTHERS HAVE QUITE FIVE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND THAT DOES NOT. ASSURE THAT WE HAVE A STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE. I BELIEVE NOW THAT. OVER ELEVEN A ROUGH ELEVEN HEALTH LABS THAT IT CLOSED. AT THE LAST YOU KNOW DO. OR MORE. AND WHEN WE REALLY THINK OF THAT HEALTH LABORATORIES WORD FIRST. THAT DO ANY OF THE TEST RELATED KOBE TO NOW THERE ARE. MOVING ON IT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW SEQUENCING AND SO FOR SO THEY PAY A CRITICAL ROLE. AND WE WERE NEED A- WHAT THE RIGHT SIZE OF PUBLIC YOU KNOW PUBLIC LABS IN OUR SPEECH BE AND I THINK THERE'S MANY OTHER IT. THAT I WOULD JUST YEAR WHERE. YOU KNOW REALLY NEED TO. AND THEN. WORK TOWARD- ABLE TO STAFF UP AT HAVE THE RIGHT RESOURCES THAT WE CAN BE PREPARED WE LOOK AT PUBLIC HEALTH. JUST AS A OTHER. SAFETY FUNCTION RIGHT AND- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR STATE AND PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ALLOWING ME TO GO A LITTLE LONGER TO ADDRESS OUR QUESTIONS.

WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FROM THE CHANGES WE MAKE WE'VE SEEN THE BENEFITS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REACH OTHER STUDENTS WHEN WE CREATED PROGRAMS TO SERVE THE CRITICAL NEEDS OF DEMOCRATS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY IGNORED IN THE PAST. WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION.

AT THE BEGINNING WE WEREN'T EQUIPPED WITH PP INSPECTORS RASTER SPEC BUSINESS AS WELL HE IS FINE WANTED REJECT THEMSELVES AND LOVED ONES AT HOME. IT'S A SITUATION AND NOBODY SHOULD EVER FIND THEMSELVES. AS QUOTED MARSHON INSPECTORS WERE CONFRONTED BY HOSPITAL WORKERS AND PATIENTS FOR EXAMPLE LEGIONS INSPECTORS INTO A VERBAL ABUSE WELL THE INTERACTIONS WERE FILMED AND POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE COULD HAVE BEEN MINIMIZED IF RESOURCES WERE AVAILABLE LOCALLY OR POSSIBLY PROVIDED ON THE STATE FEDERAL LOCAL. EXAMPLE THE NEED FOR PP WAS SOMETHING THAT SEEMED TO CATCH EVERYONE OFF GUARD IT SPEAKS TO THE NEED FOR ENHANCED PREPARATION. OR FOR ALL THE- LOCALLY WE COULD HAVE BENEFITTED IF THE GROUNDWORK WAS ALREADY LATE. ON LICENSE FOOD VENDING. LOCALLY THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE NO FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE TO DO THIS WORK ALTHOUGH WE DID WELL THEIR DRESS CODE ISSUES AND PERMITTED FOOD FACILITIES.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT ANY ANY INPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. A NOTHING AND THIS TIME VENTURE AT. EJECUTIVAS FINANCE THANKS JACK. OF THE L. A. L. I MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AND SEND YOU A PIC FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- I JUST HAVE ONE SORT OF INFORMATIONAL POINTS TO RAISE ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT AND IT WAS NOT YET DISCUSSED IT AT- DURING THIS ISSUE TODAY AND- THAT IS RELATED TO THE VARIOUS- ACTIVITIES AND EFFORTS OVER THE COMING YEAR I WANTED TO MENTION THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WILL BECOME AVAILABLE. TO THE STATE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT THAT WAS RECENTLY PASSED- AND I WOULD NOTE THAT IN ADDITION OUR OFFICE WILL BE PUBLISHING A POST IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS- HIGHLIGHTING THE HEALTH RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE ACT SO- I WON'T GET INTO IT TOO ALL OF THE SPECIFIC AMOUNTS BUT I JUST MENTION THAT IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE A. R. P. ACT INCLUDES NEARLY SIXTY SEVEN BILLION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS WITH SEPARATE POTS OF FUNDING FOR TESTING CONTACT TRACING BLACK CAPACITY AND RELATED ACTIVITIES ABOUT GOOD FOR GENOMICS SEQUENCING ABOUT GOOD FOR VACCINE RELATED ACTIVITIES AND THEN A SEPARATE BUCKET FOR SUPPORTING AND SUSTAINING THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH FUNDING WILL COME TO CALIFORNIA- WE DO KNOW THAT THUS FAR THE STATE IS SET TO RECEIVE- AT LEAST ONE POINT TWO SIX BILLION AND L. A. COUNTY WILL RECEIVE- ITS OWN DIRECTOR LOCATIONS OF AT LEAST A THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILLION- SOME OF THIS FUNDING IS FOR ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT SCHOOL PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY. TO SUPPORT SCHOOL RE OPENING- THE STATE WILL ALSO SOME THE FUNDS FOR TO SUPPORT GENOMIC SEQUENCE SEQUENCING- THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN MILLION FOR VACCINE RELATED ACTIVITIES. AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THE STATE WILL ALSO RECEIVE ARE PRESUMABLY WILL RECEIVE SOME AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE WHICH HAS- ARE A BEEN AN ISSUE THAT'S- BEEN BROUGHT UP IN A NUMBER OF. BY A NUMBER OF THE SPEAKERS TODAY- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- ONE CHALLENGE WITH THIS FUNDING IS THAT IT'S ONE TIME IN NATURE. AND SO EVEN THOUGH THE ALLOWABLE EXPENSES INCLUDE SPENDING ON WAGES AND BENEFITS- THE FUNDING CAN ALSO BE USED ON GP DATA MNAGEMENT AND I. T. SO THERE WILL JUST. YOU KNOW. JUST TAKE CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING HOW TO SPEND THIS FUNDING- THAT IT IS ONE TIME IN NATURE AND- THE LEGISLATURE MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER HOW TO LEVERAGE THAT FUNDING- MOVING FORWARD AND GIVEN THAT. IT WILL. EXPIRE SO THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BE LOOKING LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT- IF I COULD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATIONS AND THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE FOR. YOUR TIRELESS WORK. DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND ALL THE TIME I PUBLIC. EVERYBODY KNOWS NOW HOW IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH IS- DURING THE PANDEMIC I WAS MOSTLY DEALING WITH I JUST HAD A SINGLE COUNTY AT THAT TIME BUT I BUT I KNOW ISSUES AROUND CAL READY AND DATA ENTRY AND COMMUNICATION. ALL OF THOSE THINGS OF COURSE. WERE WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH THEM BUT I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT. OUR OUR VACCINE RATES GOING DOWN. AND ALSO IT'S JUST SOME OF THE- THE STRESS AND TENSION I THINK THAT WAS CREATED. BY NOT HAVING FULLY FUNDED PUBLIC HEALTH AND JUST THE DIVISION THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING THEN. BUT THIS IDEA AROUND MESSAGING I IS AND IMPORTANT AND I'M ONE. I DON'T KNOW FROM THE LOW BUT ALL FROM THE STATE LEVEL HOW ARE WE- HOWEVER WE USE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE- AND WE'RE THINKING. MESSAGE AND FOR. TO LIKE THAT I MEAN I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THE- AT T. IT WAS A HOT MESS. WE DID THE BEST WE COULD SOME OF THE BEING FAXED AND HAND WRITTEN AND- EVERYTHING WE CAN WE'LL DO BETTER ON THAT BUT THIS IDEA OF MESSAGING I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT- COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC RIGHT NOW CAN CAN SIMPLY SPEAK TO MIL ROUTE MESSAGING ON WHAT THE PLAN IS FOR THAT GOING FORWARD JUST IN IN GETTING VACCINATED BUT EVEN THEN FURTHER THAT JUST IT WOULDN'T GET BACK TO TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH IN A WAY THAT- MOST AMERICANS CAN HEAR. AND WHAT'S THAT GOING TO COST. DURING THE FINALE MIGHT HAVE TO COME BACK TO YOU. WHO ARE SO I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE EFFORTS UNDERWAY WE HAVE OUR VACINE ALL FIFTY EIGHT CAMPAIGN. I'M I THINK THERE WAS A AND AN INITIAL TIME INVESTMENT OF ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS I'M AND WE ARE AND THIS MONTH. REALLY FOCUSING ON YOUTH AFRICAN AMERICAN LATIN POPULATIONS TO REALLY GET A LOT OF MESSAGING OUT AND HOSTING A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THIS MONTH TO TRY TO- REALLY ADDRESS THE VACCINE HESITANCY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE VACCINE IS SAFE. I'M AND YOU REALLY WORK WITH NOT ONLY- BESTEHT AND CAMPAIGNS BUT TO WORK WITH A TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND TO ENGAGE CPOS IN THIS WORK THEY'VE BEEN I'M- THERE WAS FUNDING FOR BRINGING ON CBO'S AS WE ARE DOING TESTING AND OTHER THINGS WE RE DIRECTED SOME OF THOSE SAME. I'M PEOPLE ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY TO ADDRESS OUTRAGE AND SO A NUMBER OF EFFORTS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW WE ARE ON THE GROUND IN SEVERAL COUNTIES. REALLY LOOKING OUT VACCINE HESITANCY FROM OUT SORT OF COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT WHERE WE CAN STAGE THE- I SPENT OF AND VACCINE. AND LOCATIONS WITH SURROUNDING THAT WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OUTREACH TO DRUM UP DEMAND IN THOSE AREAS AND THEN FOLLOW THAT. WITH ONGOING MESSAGING AROUND SAFETY AND VACCINE- CONCERNS SO THAT WE GET TO PEOPLE WITH EASY TO EASY TO GET VACCINATED. ALSO THE EDUCATION A MESSAGING AND TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND SO I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EFFORTS UNDER WAY I KNOW THERE ARE ALSO SOME OF OUR LOCALS WHO MAY WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THEIR INNOVATIVE IDEAS FOR MESSAGING- FOR. PARTNERSHIPS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- ONE THAT WE HEARD ABOUT TODAY CAME FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY WHICH THEY'RE PUTTING IN PLACE TOMORROW CALLED FIRE AND ICE. THEY'RE USING FIREMEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ALONG WITH ICE CREAM TRUCKS YOU TRY TO GET SOME INTEREST IN GETTING VACCINATED AND REALLY LOOKING AT WAYS THAT THAT CAN COME ON BOARD WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT THE NATION IN NEW JERSEY OF ALL PLACES WHICH IS WHERE I WAS BORN. THEY'LL BRING UP THEIR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE- SHOTS AND BEERS AND ALL OF THEIR BREWERIES ARE OFFERING- IN A VACCINE WITH. A FREE BEER IF YOU GET VACCINATED DID TO TRY AND ATTRACT SOME OF THE YOUNGER POPULATION AND SO WE'RE SEEING SOME VERY INNOVATIVE IDEAS PARTNERSHIPS WITH HEALTH CARE PARTNERSHIPS WITH CBO'S RIGHT SOME PEOPLE CALLING IT THE TRIO WHERE YOU'VE GOT. A CBO- PROVIDER AND MAYBE I HAVE MY CAL BACKS IMPROVED PROVIDER AND SOME CLINICAL STAFF TOGETHER TO REALLY LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS OF BRINGING VACCINATIONS IN TWO COMMUNITIES AND WE KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO HIT THE KEY ONE POPULATION. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE TARGETED AND FOCUSED AND DO IT IN WAYS THAT REALLY INVITE PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED. WHO MIGHT HAVE DISTRUST IN THIS. MICHELLE GIVE FROM ENJOY OKAY HANDS UP TO TALK ABOUT LOCAL EFFORTS OKAY. THE AREA OKAY TALK TO BE. YEAH SURE I WAS TALKING ABOUT- RPI OR PUBLIC INFORMATION PERSON AND WE REALLY NEED- A DEDICATED PERSON THIS IS A THERE'S A SCIENCE TO COMMUNICATION IS A SKILL TO HAVE AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE FOUNDATIONAL CAPABILITIES THAT THAT WAS FINALLY HAVE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT ALL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YEAH THERE ISN'T A DEDICATED FUNDING STREAM FOR IT DOESN'T FIT INTO REALLY THOSE SILENT FINDINGS AND SO. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MANY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DIDN'T POP IN PLACE- WE HAD ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE TRYING TO FILL THAT FUNCTION BUT YOU DON'T REALLY DEVELOP GOOD SKILLS THAT THAT I HAVE TO SAY IF IT'S A FUNCTION DON'T BY FIVE PEOPLE SO. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL- STAFF. THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE FUNDING TO KEEP ON GOING- SO THERE'S THAT. OF THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS DEVELOPING THAT PARTNERING WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OUR SCHOOLS AND OTHERS TO DO THAT- AND THEN THINKING ABOUT HOW- JUST TALKING ABOUT. GETTING VACCINES OUT AND- IT MESSAGING ABOUT IT AND ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK WE STOLEN FROM MADERA COUNTY IS GOING INTO SCHOOLS AND WE HAVE HEALTH PLANS- FUNDING- MONEY SO YOU. YOU YOU COME AND GET YOUR VACCINE AS A STUDENT AND YOU COULDN'T. TELL- DESIGNATE A APPROVED COLLECTIVITY TO RECEIVE A DOLLAR THAT'S COMING FOR THE HEALTH PLAN SO IT'S A WAY TO FUNDRAISE FOR YOUR YOUR SPORTS TEAM FOR EUROPE. LATIN CLUB WHATEVER YOU HAVE. AND GET VACCINE AND BRING IN YOUR FAMILY AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN JUST KEEP MULTIPLYING THE FUNDING SO. TRYING TO FIND UNIQUE WAYS TO GO INTO OUR MOST H. BACK PORCH ON ONE SCHOOLS AND- AND HELP THEM RAISE MONEY FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES AS WELL SO. LOOKING AT SOME INTERESTING WAYS I LIKE THE ASKING TO- ANYWAY LET TO TRY TO PROMOTE. AND COMMUNICATE. AND ENSURE ACCESSION. THANK YOU AS WAS GIVEN TO THE GOD AND UP AS WELL. YES THEY YOU- I WOULD JUST ADD. ECHO MUCH OF WHAT ADD DOCTOR VS. ONLY A COUPLE THINGS THAT I WOULD OUT AS YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE OFTEN HAS TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND AS FOR TURNING THE CORNER INTO THE HARDER TO REACH POPULATIONS AS WELL THOSE THAT. HAVE A BIT MORE HESITANCY AND GOING OUT INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES IT'S BEEN THE TOP OF OUR DISCUSSIONS IN GOING IN AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GOING INTO WHERE THEY ARE VERSUS TRYING TO DRAW THEM INTO THE MASS BACKSIDES AND SO. JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE WHETHER THAT'S COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ARE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND OTHERS THAT HAVE THOSE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS THAT WILL BE THOSE TRUSTED MESSENGERS IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL- AND THEN TWO OTHER AREAS OUTSIDE OF VACCINE MESSAGING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS- I THINK THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE- SOME. SOME BROAD MESSAGING ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE AGING WORKFORCE AND AS YOU HEARD FROM- THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. AND PARTICIPANTS THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIND OF LEFT PUBLIC HEALTH DURING THIS TIME REALLY WERE EARLY RETIREMENTS AND SO FORTH AND SO WE WILL NEED TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE CAMPAIGN TO DRIVE INTEREST INTO THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. AND THEN LASTLY I THINK AND- DURING THE PANDEMIC FOLKS KNOW WHO PUBLIC HEALTH IS THAT OFTEN BECAUSE OF RULES AND REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WERE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE AND SHOW ALL OF THE OTHER AREAS IN WHICH PUBLIC HEALTH HELPS TO BENEFIT COMMUNITIES AND NOT JUST THAT. THE RULES IN THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SO I THINK THERE COULD BE BETTER MESSAGING THERE SO THAT FOLKS REALLY UNDERSTAND AND VALUE PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE FUTURE. I THOUGHT MR DELA. CRUZ DID A LOVELY JOB OF TALKING ABOUT THAT- ICE- MS. HOSTED FOR. AUTO MANUFACTURER AND- THANK YOU MUCH- YES I JUST WANTED TO REALLY LEAN INTO THE POINT AROUND THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS IF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAMILIES AND YOUNG PEOPLE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE WHAT PEOPLE LEAN INTO AND SO TO BE STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED IN COMMUNITIES TO HAVE THOSE INTER GENERATIONAL AND HISTORIC RELATIONSHIPS HAVE REALLY MADE THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF REACHING IS HARD- HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS. OUR ORGANIZATION- AS PART OF OUR- CRT P. WORK- HAS MADE OVER THREE THOUSAND PHONE CALLS TO FAMILIES AROUND THE VACCINATIONS AND HELP TO SCHEDULE OVER NINE HUNDRED APPOINTMENTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND IT REALLY TAKES IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION BECAUSE OF FAMILIES ARE NOT ABLE TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE EVEN WITH THEIR CELL PHONES TO MAKE THE VACCINATION APPOINTMENTS THEY NEED THAT WARM HAND OFF AND THEY'LL ONLY ACCEPT THE WARM HAND OFF IF THEY ARE HAVE TRUST. IN THE MESSENGER SO JUST WANTED TO STRESS THAT AND ALSO THAT IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS- THAT ARE HERE AND IT FOR EXAMPLE IN MY IN POPULATIONS WHO DO NOT HAVE A WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND SO YOU NEED TO HAVE AGAIN THE CULTURALLY COMPETENT MESSENGERS THAT REPRESENT THOSE COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE. IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH BROWN AND SPECIFICALLY AROUND VACCINATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEM BACK TO MS GIVENS POINT TO ABOUT TO- MESSAGING ABOUT WORKFORCE WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT OF OUR- FOLKS COMING FROM ARE MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WITH FOR TRUSTED MESSENGERS I KNOW JUST. EVERY TIME I READ THE PAPER I SEE ONE MORE OF OUR BLACK SENIORS WHO WHO HAVES SUCCUMB TO THIS WAR- UNIT IN MY IN MY WORK IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY I KNOW THAT THE A LOT OF THE OUTRAGE WE DO IS- IS SO INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT BUT IT'S SO VALUED ONE WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY REACHED AND THEN JUST TODAY WITH THE BITS BIG MACS. VAST MAX BACKS AND ASIAN SITE AND ARE ARENA. WE HAD TROUBLE WITH OUR API COMMUNITY WITH- MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. ON THAT PEOPLE NEEDED AND IN TRANSPORTATION WAS ALSO ANOTHER ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR ACROSS TOWN. SO I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION I KNOW DOCTOR PAN IS EAGER TO GET IN HERE IS JUST AROUND. AND AS YOU KNOW THE SENATE HAS REALLY PRIORITIZE PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR BUILD BACK BOLDLY AND WILL BE MAKING VERY BIG INVESTMENTS- FOR THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM. BUT I GUESS WHEN WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT OUR WORK FORCE- IT IS IT. AND I KNOW WE'VE LOST ENOUGH AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL HAVE WE LOST LIKE TO I WE DO WE NEED TO DOUBLE IT DO WE NEED TO TRIPLE IT WHAT ARE WE- WHAT ARE SOME KIND OF PROJECTIONS- ONLY TALK ABOUT. INCREASING STAFF BOTH AT THE STATE AND THE- AND THE COUNTY LEVELS. I DON'T KNOW THE STARTER FINALE- REFUSE FINALE OR- ON THE OTHER PANELIST. HEY THIS IS MICHELLE GIBBONS AGAIN I WOULD JUST MAYBE START OFF THE CONVERSATION BY GIVING YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND THEY HAD SAID THAT THEY HVE HAD DOUBLE NEARLY TRIPLE THE SIZE OF THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC SO THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW KIND OF WHERE THE DEFICITS WERE- ALSO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WORK FORCES DECLINE BY ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. I'M OVER THE PAST DECADES AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT TO THINK THROUGH THAT. PART OF THE REASON WHY WE REALLY NEED THE ASSESSMENT. IS TO REALLY. AND WHAT THE ADEQUATE LEVELS OF WORKFORCE THE TO BE FOR OUR STATE BUT ONE THING THAT I CAN SAY IS WE WILL BE. IN AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THERE WILL BE THAT THE TWO COMPETING ISSUES ONE IS THAT WE NEED ONGOING FUNDING IN ORDER TO BOLSTER AND GROW THAT WORK FORCE THE OTHER IS THAT WE WILL BE BACK FILLING POSITIONS THAT WE- WE HAVE CURRENTLY- BECAUSE OF THOSE EARLY RETIREMENTS ARE MOVING ON AND SO. I'M I THINK I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE TWO CHALLENGES FOR YOU AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE RE DIRECTED SO MANY STAFF THAT PART OF HOW WE'RE USING THE FEDERAL DOLLARS IS TO ALLOW SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE TO BE DIRECTED BACK TO THEIR NORMAL WORK. ON SAID WE'VE INCREASED OUR STAFFING POSSIBLY RE DIRECT. IT NEARLY HALF OF OUR STAFF OF THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THIRTY PM. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR OF FIRST OF ALL IT'S ONCE AGAIN- I KNOW THAT- I THINK- MR DELA CRUZ FROM S. YEAH YOU- BRIEFLY MENTIONED IN HIS REMARKS BUT- I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK ALL THE PEOPLE WERE ON THE FRONT LINES AND PUBLIC HEALTH I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU UNFORTUNATELY HAVE IN DOING YOUR WORK AND DOING YOUR JOB AND PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO HATE AND PERSONAL ATTACKS. WE SEEN THIS WITH- HEALTH OFFICERS IN FACT JUST COUPLE DAYS AGO AND OF HAVING TO RELEASE A STATEMENT WHERE A PUBLIC LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER UP IN YUBA SUTTER ACTUALLY THAT I COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER WAS USING DEATH THREATS FOR MONTHS- AND IS NOW HAVE TO HAS HAS ARMED GUARDS- BECAUSE OF THAT- BUT THAT GOAL DIFFERENT LOOK OUT LEVELS- THAT PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS HAVE BEEN. UNFORTUNATELY SUBJECT TO- PERSONAL AND THREATS AND I KNOW THERE WAS ENVIRONMENTAL OFFICER WHO WAS STABBED AND DIE I THINK. AS WELL THE PAST YEAR- IT I JUST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK ON THE FRONT LINES AND FRANKLY THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT THE THAT PEOPLE CALLING FOR THESE. TYPES THE BROTHER TERRASSE MEANT OR ACTUAL ATTACKS ON ON PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES. SO I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT- BECAUSE OF. QUESTION I GUESS IS FOR- L. A- YOU YOU MENTIONED SO THEY- RESCUE PLAN JUST TO BE CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING SO WE'RE ALL SAYING LOOK AT ALL THIS FEDERAL MONEY IT'S- IT THIS IS. TEMPORARY MONEY RIGHT IT'S ALL IS IT ONLY FOR A YEAR HOW LONG IS HOW HOW LONG DO WE GET THE MONEY FOR- THE STATIC. THANK YOU SENATOR SOME OF THE FUNDING SOME OF THE PARAMETERS AROUND THE FUNDING- JUST. YEAH HAVE BEEN RELEASED YEAH SO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE MORE DETAILS BUT- YEAH WE'RE STILL WAITING WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S ONE TIME IN NATURE OKAY YOU CAN FINANCE SPEAK TO THIS I MEAN HOW I KNOW IT'S ONE TIME HOW LONG THE ONLY TALK ABOUT ONE TIME A YEAR AT IT AND REALIZE THAT MAYBE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS BUT PARTICULARLY THE PUBLIC HEALTH PORTIONS OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. I CERVANTES GENTLE FINANCE- THE VARIOUS RANGES- THE VARIOUS POCKETS OF FINDING AN AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ARE TYPICALLY AVAILABLE FOR ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS- IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE TO. HOW TO DRILL INTO THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF THE ACT TO GIVE YOU A CLEAR ANSWER ON EACH ONE BUT- MOST OF THEM ARE AVAILABLE OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS OKAY SO WELL YOU'RE TALKING TWO TO FOUR YEARS- AND ESPECIALLY AGAIN THE FOCUS HERE I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING A PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY- I MEAN IT'S HARD TO HIRE SOMEONE UNTIL SOMEONE BY THE WAY I HAVE. TWO YEARS OF FUNDING AND WERE HOPING YEARS JOB WILL STILL BE THERE SO- SO I THINK PART OF OUR JOB HERE IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BUILD OUT YOU KNOW NOT BOTH NOW IN THE OUT YEARS AS WELL- FOR SUSTAINING THESE POSITIONS- NEXT. QUESTION I HAVE ACTUALLY IS- ACTUALLY FOR- CD P. H. I KNOW THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW HE DOES BASICALLY THE VACCINATION EFFORTS AND- THE COVERT EFFORTS AND SO FORTH. AND BASICALLY AND I HEARD THAT US A LOT OF HEALTH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SENT TO BECOME COVERT DEPARTMENTS BUT I WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN BEFORE CODED- WE HAD. THE MEASLES OUTBREAK THAT HAPPENED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- ACTUALLY THANKS TO PREVIOUS LEGISLATION IT WASN'T AS BAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WAS IN OTHER STATES. HE MAY BE TO THE WHAT DEGREE BOTH IN AND PERHAPS MAYBE MS GIVENS ME. MITCHELL GIVENS MAY SPEAK TO THIS TO WHAT DEGREE DO WE ACTUALLY TO SHIFT PEOPLE SO THAT OF COURSE COVERED WOULD TALK ABOUT OKAY YOU KNOW LAST A HUNDRED. YEARS AGO YOU KNOW THAT THE BIGGEST WANTED CENTER AND OBVIOUSLY REALLY BIG. BUT EVEN WITH THAT THAT MEASLES OUTBREAK WE HAD IN TWENTY NINETEEN. TO WHAT DEGREE DID THAT IMPACT PUBLIC HEALTH. DEPARTMENTS BOTH STATE AND LOCAL IN TERMS OF HAVING SHIFT PERSONNEL. I THINK EVERY LARGE OUTBREAK REQUIRES THAT WE SHIFT PERSONNEL BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL FROM OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES TO DEAL WITH THE OUTBREAK. I THINK IT VARIES BY THE IMPACT- ON. IN EACH COUNTY. BUT I KNOW THAT IN THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WE RE DIRECT MANY PEOPLE FOR EACH OF THOSE OUTBREAKS FOR THE MEASLES FOR THE HEPATITIS. pSEEN RATHER MULTI COUNTY IN THE STATE NEEDS TO STEP IN. OKAY SO AND SO I THINK CERTAINLY AND- AND PERHAPS AND IT- THAT WE GOT THINK ABOUT THIS ONGOING SURGE CAPACITY RIGHT- IN TERMS OF- BE SURE WE HAVE THE SURGE CAPACITY- IT. IN TERMS OF RIGHT IT IN SPITE T. CAPACITY WE HEARD ABOUT WITH CODED FOR EXAMPLE- I KNOW THAT- THE GOOD HEALTH OFF FROM STANISLAUS COUNTY TALK ABOUT HOW JUST. JUST TOTALLY OVERWHELMED I MEAN AND I'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT ESSENTIALLY PEOPLE TRYING TO SEND DATA BY FAX MACHINE HE- AND THEN HAVING TO BUY A SHE WASN'T SIXTY MINUTES HE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE BIO HAVE ACTUALLY. BOUGHT TWO FAX MACHINES IT TO COMMUNICATE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- SO- CAN WE SPEAK TO THE STATE. OF OUR IT INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACTUALLY SERVED UP EVEN IF. AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RAN INTO THIS WITH SOME OF THESE OTHER OUTBREAKS BUT- IS THERE A STATE I MEAN THIS IS WHAT. IS YOUR STATEWIDE I. T. ASSESSMENT SO AND I KNOW WE NEED STAFF TO AND THAT'S ALSO YOU COULD EASILY IGNITE MORE IMPORTANT BUT- IN TERMS OF OUR IT CAPACITY IN PUBLIC HEALTH AS A WHOLE NETWORKS OF MILLER TO HAVE CD PH YOU HAVE. COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEN IT NEEDS INTERFACE OF HOSPITALS LABS AND OTHERS HEALTHCARE ENTITIES AS WELL- HAS SOMEONE DONE A IN I. T. ASSESSMENT FOR. PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH I MEAN OF COURSE I'M SURE WE JUST NOW BUILT UP SOME SYSTEMS RECOVERED AND SO FORTH- IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY- YOU KNOW WE HAD REPLACED CAL READY BUT REALLY THINKING SYSTEMATICALLY. ABOUT THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND CERTAINLY I'VE BEEN TAUGHT- IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IS TO PUBLIC HEALTH DATA AS THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL PUBLIC HEALTH SO WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD ARTISTE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN'T REALLY DO OUR JOBS. SO CAN WE SEE THIS ONCE THE LAST TIME THE DEPARTMENT- YOUNG STATE GOVERNMENT'S DONE AND I. T. THE TOTAL I. T. EVALUATION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SO IT'S NOT JUST STATE. YOU KNOW C. P. H. I. T. SYSTEM IT'S REALLY UP AND DOWN YOU KNOW ENTER HOW INTERFACES THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HOW COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S HOW INTERFACES THE STATE HOW THE INTERFACE OF LAUGHTER UNIFIED WITH. HOSPITALS OTHER PROVIDERS OR HAVING TO REPORT DATA AND OF COURSE IT'S NOT JUST CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. OVER TALK ABOUT EQUITY AND OTHERS OTHER THINGS. BUT WHAT WHAT HAS IT EVER BEEN DONE OUR WINS LAST TIME THAT'S BEEN EVALUATED. M. I CAN TELL YOU THE LAST TIME BUT I CAN TELL YOU WERE OVERDUE I THINK WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS AS WE LOOKED AT THE COW READY SYSTEM AS WE LOOK AT CARE AS WE LOOKED AT GROWING HOW CAN ACT I THINK THE WAY THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING SYSTEMS. LEND THEMSELVES TO USING SIMILAR PAP PLATFORMS AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO TO CONNECT ALL OF THE LECTERN OF HEALTH RECORDS- I THINK WE'RE MOVING DOWN THAT PATH BUT I THINK THAT ONE THAT YOU KNOW AS WE'RE INVESTING SOME OF THESE FEDERAL DOLLARS WERE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THAT OVER ARCHING ISSUE. THAT WE HAVE EVERY STATE I PLEASE ALLOW LOOKING LOOKING IS THERE IS SO JUST THANKS FOR THE QUESTION THEN- WHEN CAN WE EXPECT IN I. T. PLANNED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND I KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S EVEN LEGISLATION GOING THROUGH NOW ABOUT REGIONAL HEALTH EXCHANGES AND SO FORTH. THAT AND KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE TO INTERFACE NOT ONLY WITHIN BUT ALSO SO- IS WITH HIM ON SOCIAL SERVICES THERE'S A LARGE IT PROJECT GOING THROUGH WITH THE STATE THE SSS AND COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT CETERA PRAYER WILL BE DONE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WHEN CAN WE EXPECT A PLAN FROM CDPH AND VARIOUS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR AN IT INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM I WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I CAN'T COMMIT TO A DAY OR TIME TODAY BUT I KNOW THAT IT IS A PRIORITY FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND WE'LL GET OUR I. T. INTERNET AGENTS WORKS TOGETHER TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE KNOW HOW I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A PROPOSAL AND IT CAN BE TOTALLY FUNDED FROM THE FEDS. MORE POWER TO YOU- BUT IF YOU NEED STATE MONEY THEN WE SHOULD BE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT OKAY. AND THEN- ALL RIGHT AND THEN IT AND I SAID THIS IS NOT JUST FOR CD PH THIS IS THIS IS TOP YOU KNOW TOP THROUGH BUT YOU DON'T BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE A LOT ABOUT CONNECTING HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE SURGEON AND A LOT OF THE OTHER PIECES THAT WE NEED TO CONTACT. RESPOND TO SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE BUT ALSO THE RIPPLE RESPONDED FIRES AND OTHER EVENTS THAT HAPPEN EVERY YEAR RIGHT AND THEN WE HAVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND ELSEWHERE YES VALLEY FEVER WE HAVE. LOTS OF THINGS GOING ON AND WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY RIGHT SO WE NEED TO HAVE OKAY- AND THEN THE OTHER PART IS I JUST ON THE STAFFING LEVEL- AND I KNOW THERE'S VARIOUS PROPOSAL OUT THERE- BUT- SHOULDN'T HAVE SO YOU KNOW AND- YES WE HAD ESSENTIALLY. WE HAVE A CERTAIN YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A SYSTEM MUTUAL AID SYSTEM RIGHT. SO WE HAVE FIRE DEPARTMENTS- YES PROVIDES THEM WITH FIRE TRUCKS AND OTHER TYPES OF EQUIPMENT AND THEN WHEN THERE'S OF WILDFIRE AND YES THERE'S BEEN TIMES THEY'VE BEEN OVERRUN BLENDER SO MANY WILDFIRES BUT- HAVE WE THOUGHT ABOUT ESSENTIALLY A KIND OF MUTUAL AID SYSTEM FUNDED BY THE STATE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WHERE WE ACTUALLY PAY FOR IT WOULD NOT FIRE TRUCKS BUT MAYBE STE. PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF WILL BE STATIONED AT LOCAL YOU KNOW AND ACTUALLY IMPRESSED PAID FOR BY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OR CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BUT- COULD BE MOBILIZED ONE HAVE BASIC SKILL SETS THAT COULD BE MOBILIZED TO HANDLE OUTBREAKS- SAYS- SO THAT- WE WOULD BE SO WE HAVE. THAT IN PLACE A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM HAS BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT FOR IS A WAY TO IS THIS ONE AT LEAST. ONE ELEMENT OF THE WORK FORCE APPROACH. WE ARE USING SOME OF FEDERAL DOLLARS LOOK AT OF LIKE A- HOW. CORPS AND LOOKING AT WAYS TO BUILD UP SOME OF THOSE STAFF AND PLACING THEM AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SO WE ARE. DOING SOME OF THAT WE HAVE- YOU CDC STAFF IN THAT SAME WAY- THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC. I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. DO YOU HAVE A PRETTY ROBUST MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WHEN EMERGENCIES HIT. WHERE THEY DO RESPOND TO ONE ANOTHER AND PUT SOME OF THEIR- HAPPY STAFF SOME OF THEIR RESPONSE STAFF IN- ONE. AND YOU KNOW FROM ONE JURISDICTION INTO AN IMPACTED JURISDICTION BUT I THINK. THAT IS MORE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR RESPONSE IT DOES IMPACT BOTH OF THOSE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN TERMS OF- LETTING SOME OF THEIR STAFF AND- SO. WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THAT SO I HOPE I HOPE THERE CAN BE SOME WORK. DONE ON THAT AND I REALIZE THAT FIRST OF ALL- I KNOW THAT. PUBLIC HEALTH COOPERATIVES THE OTHER PART IS BECAUSE WE ARE EVERYONE SO SHORT STAFFED. I DON'T THINK IT. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON PEOPLE HAVE TO DO THAT AS WELL BUT LET'S THINK ABOUT DOING IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY IS IT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE SHORT STAFFED BECAUSE WERE ADEQUATELY STAFFED. SO SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AND THEN FINALLY. I IN TERMS OF LAB RESOURCES AND I KNOW WE TALKED- TOUCHED ON. IT A IT WAS MENTIONED THAT MANY. REGIONAL LABS ARE CLOSED. IS THERE IS THAT THERE IS THERE BEEN DISCUSSIONS AT C. PH AND REGIONALLY AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN ALSO HAVE. THIS GIVENS ADDRESSED THIS. AT ALL THE DIFFERENT EIGHT YOU KNOW I KIND OF DROPPED HER OFF BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE ITEMS AS WELL AFTER ACKERMAN C. PH. IN TERMS OF MAYBE A REGIONAL APPROACH TO LAB. TWO TWO TWO LABS. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE. COUNTIES AT CLOSE LABS BUT THERE'S NOT LIKE A SYSTEMATIC PLAN. SO THEN THE COUNTY GOES OKAY WE'LL CLOSE OUR LAB AND THEN WE'LL FIND SOME OTHER COUNTY LAB TO COVER FOR US IT'S UNDER- BUT- THAT IS THERE SOME SORT OF PLANNING APPROACH TO LAB CAPACITY. BEYOND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY A STATE LAB BUT THEN WE ALSO. YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE SOME REMAINING COUNTY LABS. IS. THERE REGIONAL APPROACH TO A LAB RESOURCES. SOME NOW I THINK WE RE EXAMINING THAT WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WERE SETTING UP SOME PUBLIC HEALTH WORK FORCE AND WORK GROUPS TO REALLY LOOK AT. I'M AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE PANDEMIC AS WELL AS AND WHAT COMES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR. LOOKING AT WHAT. CAPABILITY SHOULD BE REGIONAL WHAT. CAPABILITIES SHOULD BE STATEWIDE WHAT SHOULD BE LOCAL. I'M AND REALLY LOOKING AT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LAB INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED A LOT. ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO MEET AND THAT. NEED FOR NAY ABILITY TO BRING ON NEW TASKS AND BRING THEM ON QUICKLY AND TO YOU. KNOW WITH HE VALENCIA LAB SORT OF WHAT THE FUTURE OF THAT LAB LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF- BOW QUARTER PUBLIC HEALTH. CAPACITY BUT I THINK AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ROOM TO GROW- AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT EACH HEALTH DEPARTMENT. HAVING THEIR OWN PUBLIC HEALTH LAB PROBABLY. MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT WHERE- MAYBE IT JUST DOESN'T IF THE COUNTY IS SO SMALL WHERE WE A REGIONAL APPROACH MIGHT MAKE. SENSE I THINK OR WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF REGIONAL APPROACH IS MAYBE. SPECIALIZING SOME OF OUR LABS TO PLAY SOME OF THE ROLES. THAT MAYBE EVERY LAB HERE- PLAY. THAT'S REGIONALIZATION. WELL AT THE AT THE END LIKE IT'S A THINK ABOUT MORE SYSTEMATICALLY THAN JUST THE EACH COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISORS GOING WITHIN CLOSE OUR LAB. SO AND- HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT SUPPORTING THE LABS ARE THERE SO. MAYBE PERHAPS WE CAN NOT FOLLOW UP ON AGAIN I TALKED ABOUT THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE. STAFFAN LABS PERHAPS MAYBE MICHELLE GIBBONS AND PERHAPS ALSO CITED THAT IF WE CAN HAVE THE HEALTH OFFICERS DOWN THE COUNTY DR- SORRY VISION PAN. MAYBE COMMENT ON THOSE ITEMS AS WELL. FROM THEIR EXPERIENCES AND THE COUNTY. I THINK IT'S AN PAN QUESTIONS IS USED. AND I WOULD JUST SAY TERMS THE TWENTY NINETEEN MEASLES OUTBREAK YOU ARE CORRECTED THAT THERE ALWAYS HAS TO BE A SHIFT OF. FOCUS IN A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHEN THERE IS AN OUTBREAK. AND SO MANY OF THE STAFF GET COLD FROM OTHER ISSUES OTHER AT PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM SO YOU CAN. IMAGINE SOMEONE AND THAT S. TV PROGRAMS. AND GETTING PULLED OVER TO YOU KNOW FOCUS ON THE MEASLES OUTBREAK IN NEW DISEASE INVESTIGATION. THE ONE THING I JUST WANTED TO REALLY CALL OUT IS WHEN THEY'RE BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT FEDERAL FUNDING USUALLY COMES DOWN FOR THE BIG THINGS AND- AND- WIN THAT% DISEASE OUTBREAK HAPPENS IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS COME DOWN THEY'RE STILL. AT A TIME LAG. IN ADDITION WE'RE TAKING A INDIVIDUAL FRIEND ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT'S FEDERALLY FUNDED POTENTIALLY OR STATE FUNDED WITH REQUIREMENTS. THEN THAT THEN HAVE TO BE SHIFTED OVER TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE COMING DOWN THE WAY. AND SO THAT MEANS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A GAP IN TIME IN WHICH THAT PERSON CANNOT ACTUALLY. MEET THE DELIVERABLES OF THEIR ORIGINAL PROGRAM AND THEN PUT A FURTHER STRAIN ON THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS WELL SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT TO JUST CALL OUT. IN TERMS OF THE DEED I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK MANY OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS LEAD THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO REVISIT THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE AND FIGURE OUT. A WAY TO EXPAND AND MAKE IT MORE ROBUST. THERE WAS NOTHING MORE CHALLENGING THAN TRYING TO- WALK THROUGH DATA CHALLENGES DURING THE PANDEMIC IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DATA WAS MATCHING AND WHERE THERE WERE DISCREPANCIES THAT WE WERE IDENTIFYING AND FIGURING OUT WHAT THE ISSUES WERE. AND INDEED IT TOOK UP A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND SO WE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THERE- AND THE ONE THING THAT I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT IN THE ASSESSMENT THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD ARE PROPOSING THREE EIGHTY TWO FORTY. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST WORKFORCE I THINK WORKFORCE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THAT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO ACCESS DATA INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE OUR- LABORATORY CAPACITY SO I THINK ALL OF THOSE ARE THINGS THAT. WHILE WE SHOULD NOT WAIT TO INVEST IN THEM NOW WE SHOULD MAKESURE THAT WE HAVE A ROAD MAP FOR WHAT. WE WANT CALIFORNIA TO BE CALM AND MAKE SURE THEY WE ARE CONTINUE. TO MAKE. TO GET THEIR- AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE STAFF BEING- YOU YOU KNOW I THINK AS- MISS FINALE ADDRESS THIS. AND YES WE DEFINITELY WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN. ACT WHERE WE HAVE MUTUAL AID AND SO WE DO THE MEDICAL MUTUAL AID SYSTEM INCLUDES PUBLIC HEALTH WORK FORCE AND I THINK THAT. CRITICAL CHALLENGE THERE IS IF EVERYBODY'S UNDER RESOURCE THAT NOBODY CAN SHARE AND NOT IS THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS AND SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE COULD MAKE THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE LOCALLY MORE ROBUST IN PLACE MORE PEOPLE THEY WILL HAVE LOCAL EXPERTISE THAT THEN COULD GO INTO ANOTHER JURISDICTION AND SUPPORT THEM. AND THEY ALREADY HAVE TRAINING AND PRACTICES THERE SO INSTEAD OF KEEPING THEM IN SOME. KIND OF RESERVE AREA WHICH- YOU KNOW I THINK GETTING MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE IN. THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT HELPING TO ADDRESS THE DAY TO DAY ISSUES AND THEN AT THE AVAILABLE FOR MUTUAL AID IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN- JUST ONE ECHO THE LABORATORY RESOURCES I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE REVISIT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. INVESTMENT IS UNTIL LABS AND WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE ACROSS THE STATE AND MANY YOU KNOW LOOK SMALLER JURISDICTIONS WHEN A LABORATORY CLOSED. AT THE POOL TOGETHER A CONTRACT WITH ONE LAB IN AND AS WE SEE IN KOBE THEN THE LAB THAT IS OVERSEEING. THE JURISDICTION OVERSEAS A LOT THEY HAVE TO PRIORITIZE THEIR SPECIMENS- IN IN THE EVENT OF SOMETHING BIG LIKE THIS AND THEN OTHERS ARE- THEIR PRIORITY BUT- THERE ARE SOME LADS THE END UP HAPPENING AND SO WHEN THE STATE STEPPED IN WITH THE VALENCIA BRANCH LAB THAT WAS. REALLY HELPFUL AND I THINK. WE SHOULD IT REALLY REVISIT AND TRY TO BE INNOVATIVE AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE LABORATORY CAPACITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I WOULD JUST. SORRY TO BE LONG WINDED THE LAST THING I WOULD JUST SAY IS. ALL OF THESE AREAS TAKE REALLY CRITICAL AND HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE SO AT AND THEN IT CONTEXT OF LABORATORIES FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW LAB DIRECTORS ARE NOT EASY TO COME BY AND- WE REALLY NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A PIPELINE SO THAT WE HAVE. THE STAFF BEING IN THE CAPABILITIES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE- QUALITY. SERVICES COMING OUT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL. OKAY AND THEN- APPRECIATE THAT AND PERHAPS. WECHT PAN AND JUST PARTICULAR FOCUS ON. THE YOU'RE WILLINGNESS. TO AND YOUR DEPARTMENT WHEN DOES YOUR FELLOW HEALTH OFFICERS TO PARTNER AND TRYING TO. DEVELOP THESE PARTICULAR PLANS SO THAT QUICKLY. I THINK WE KEEP ASKING FOR PLANS AND I'VE I'VE I'VE SERVE INDICATED HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR EVERY YEAR BUT- WE BETTER HAVE ONE SOON SO WE CAN START. YOU KNOW MOVING ON THEM. THANK YOU YES THANK YOU AND I VERY MUCH AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID SO FAR SO- WE WILL ABSOLUTELY AREN'T STAND READY TO. HELP AND COORDINATE AND I THINK A GOOD ASSESSMENT IS NEEDED WE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WHAT THE GAPS ARE IN. AND WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE OUR OUR- OUR INTERVENTIONS AND CHANGE THINGS SO. JUST TO SPEAK- OF THE LABORATORY ISSUE ENOUGH LABORATORIES YOU THAT SECOND- THE I. T. ISSUE REPORTS YOU KNOW ELECTRONIC LAB REPORTS SO NOT ALL WERE AND HOW MANY WERE THEY BY LAW PROVIDERS ALSO HAVE TO REPORT AND THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE AN EASY WAY TO COURT AND THAT WAS MOST OF THE PHONE CALLS AND FAXES WAS PROVIDERS REPORTING UNCOVERED NINETEEN TESTS ESPECIALLY THE ANTIGEN TEST THEMSELVES. I KNOW WE WERE WORKING ON WHAT WE CALL THE EACH CASE REPORTING SO DIRECT MESSAGING FROM- PH OURS INTO POWER READY AND THAT WAS MOVING FORWARD THAT PILOT COUNTIES IT WAS MOVING BUT THE PANDEMIC KIND OF STOP THE MOVEMENT BUT THAT SOME OF THE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO IMPLEMENT TO- MORE OPERATIONALIZE OUR DATA. AND STREAMLINE WHAT WE'RE DOING- FOR THE LABORATORIES AGAINST YOU KNOW FUNDING IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE BUT MISGIVINGS JUST BROUGHT UP RIGHT THERE AT THE END- WE ARE ONE OF THE COUNTIES THE COSTAR LAB I BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND- IT WAS BECAUSE WE REALLY HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO EVER RECORD A LOT DIRECTOR I THINK WE HAVE A PART TIME RETIRED PERSON FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS IT WAS REALLY ALMOST MARCH I'M SPECIALIZED STAFFING THEN. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SAVING MONEY THIS WAS NOT ABOUT SAVING MONEY IT WAS ABOUT- TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE RESOURCES IN TRYING TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE BETWEEN TWO COUNTIES THAN AND THAT A SINGLE LAP AND IT SINGLE LABS IN BOTH COUNTIES HIMSELF REALLY I'M LOOKING AT A REGIONAL APPROACH IN A REGIONAL PLAN AND FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT WHAT WHAT IS REALLY NECESSARY IN ENSURING THAT THE STAFF IS AVAILABLE TO- IMPLEMENT THE PLAN AND WE STAND READY TO HELP ABSOLUTELY. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN JUST ONE LAST QUESTION- FOR THE CD PH- WE TALK ABOUT VACCINE OUT REACH AND I KNOW YOU TALKED AND CERTAINLY WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO VARIOUS COMMITTEES COLOR WE PARTICULARLY NEED TO PRIORITIZE GETTING VACCINES I THINK VACCINES ACCESS IS ALSO CERTAINLY A HUGE ISSUE FOR.

NATIONALLY STATE HOSPITAL'S ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS AND HOSPITALS WITH ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC UNITS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO EITHER MITIGATE THESE LIGATURE RISK OR RISK LOSING. THEIR ACCREDITATION- THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CHALLENGE AND MITIGATING THESE RISKS BASED ON THE PURCHASING AND PRODUCTION PROCESS THESE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TYPES OF CHANGES. A SPECIFIC CHALLENGES WE'VE EXPERIENCED AMONG OTHERS NATIONALLY ARE THE PRODUCTS USED TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS ARE USUALLY NOT STOCKTON MASS QUANTITIES BY VENDORS IN MANY INSTANCES ARE MADE TO CUSTOM ORDER- GIVEN THE HIGH NATIONAL DEMAND COMBINED WITH. THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY IN STOCK HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THESE MATERIALS IN A TIMELY FASHION ON THE SUFFOCATING THE LONGER PERIOD OF AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. ADDITIONALLY COVERED NINETEEN HAS IMPACTED DSHS ABILITY TO ADDRESS LIKE INTERESTING THE WAY WE HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED. ON THIS IMPACT WAS NOT ONLY FILL OUT OUR HOSPITALS WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE OPERATIONAL CHANGES TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND STAFF. INCLUDING LIMITING CONSTRUCTION AND RETROFITS A PATIENT UNITS BUT ALSO IMPACTED THE VENDORS THAT PRODUCE AND SUPPLY THESE MATERIALS. ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES ARE ONCE THE PRODUCTS ARE OBTAINED INSTALLATION OF THE SPECIALIZED MATERIALS DOES REQUIRE PLANNING AND MAY REQUIRE COORDINATION OF MULTIPLE SKILLED TRADE LABOR SUCH AS DEMOLITION CARPENTERS.

THANKS SO MUCH ANYWAYS K&lt;c.cyan&gt; RAVEL AND&lt;/c&gt; THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY ELIGIBILITY IN RESEARCHING COVER CALIFORNIA AND HAPPY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE TONIGHT ON OUR PROGRAM AND RESPONSES TO YOUR QUESTIONS UNDER ITEM ONE. A BEGIN BY PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON OUR MOST RECENT OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD IN SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIODS AND THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE AMERICAN ARRESTED PLAN ON AFFORDABILITY FOR CONSUMERS. AS OF JANUARY NEARLY ONE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAD EITHER RENEWED OR SIGNED UP FOR NEW COVERAGE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HIS NUMBER WAS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD LAST YEAR I REPRESENTED A NEW HIGH WATER MARK FOR OUR ENROLLMENT. SINCE THE END OF OUR TRADITIONAL OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD ON JANUARY THIRTY FIRST YOU CAN ACTIVELY PROMOTING SPECIAL SUB SEVERAL SPECIAL ENROLLMENT EVENTS AS PART OF OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. IN FEBRUARY WE OPEN THE SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD TO ALIGN WITH THE SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD THAT WAS LAUNCHED BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AT THE END OF JANUARY. THEN ON MARCH ELEVENTH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN WAS SIGNED- WE'VE WORKED QUICKLY TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW AND EXPANDED PREMIUM SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE UNDER THAT LAW. AND ON APRIL TWELFTH WE ANNOUNCED A NEW SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD THAT WILL RUN THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO BENEFIT FROM THE LOWER HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ACT. UP COVER CALIFORNIA WILL EMPHASIZE EARLY SIGN UPS BY INVESTING UP TO THREE AND A THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON TELEVISION RADIO AND PRINT ADS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BETWEEN ALL IN JUNE. I NOW IN THE MOVE TO THE- OF THE AMERICA RESCUE. IN RESCUE CLINIC STEP PROVISIONS TO MAKE THROUGH CHAIN MORE. FOR PLANNING TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. OUR FIRST AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE FEDERAL PREMIUM SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW LEVEL. IT ALSO ELIMINATED THE CAP ON FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME ABOVE LEVEL- FINALLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR OR RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE WEEK OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PREMIUM AND COST SHARING SUPPORT AVAILABLE THROUGH PROGRAM- THIS PROVISION WILL APPLY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE ONLY. BY THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PREMIUM AFFORDABILITY WITHIN EXCHANGES LIKE FOR CALIFORNIA. THE LAW ENSURES THAT NO ONE HAS TO PAY MORE THAN EIGHT POINT 5% OF THEIR INCOME IN PREMIUMS FOR A BENCHMARK SILVER PLANS. IT ALSO ELIMINATES PREMIUM CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOME BELOW 110050% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR MORE HELP. WOMEN GROUPS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THESE CHANGES THAT THE UNINSURED. THOSE WHO ENROLLED IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET TODAY OUTSIDE OF COVER CALIFORNIA AND OF COURSE COVER CALIFORNIA NUMBERS- CAL MEMBERS ALONE YESTERDAY THE NEW PREMIUM TAX CREDITS WILL PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY THREE BILLION MEDICINAL FEDERAL PREMIUM SAVINGS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE PROJECT THAT ON AVERAGE THAT PREMIUMS WILL DECREASE BY OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS. PER HOUSEHOLD PER MONTH COMPARED TO WHAT COSTS WOULD HAVE BEEN PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. WELL THE EXACT AMOUNT OF PREMIUM. SUBSIDY DEPENDS ON CONSUMER SPECIFIC SITUATION WE ESTIMATE THAT UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS EARNING BETWEEN NINETEEN AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR WHICH COMPRISE TWO THIRDS OF THE ELIGIBLE UNINSURED. CAN ENROLL IN THE BENCHMARK SILVER PLANS REDUCED COST SHARING FOR AN AVERAGE OF SIXTY ONE DOLLARS PER MONTH AND VIRTUALLY ALL COULD GET A BRONZE PLAN FOR ONE DOLLAR A NUMBER OF MONTHS. EXCHANGE CONSUMERS ARE FOR ANOTHER EXAMPLE OVER 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WILL HAVE A CALIFORNIA IN MAY. WILL RECEIVE AN AVERAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH IN FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR POTENTIAL SAVINGS OF NEARLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TERRY MOLD. FOR THE TWENTY MONTHS ARE THE BENEFIT IS AVAILABLE BETWEEN MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIANS CAN TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THESE NEW AND EXPANDED BENEFITS WE WORKED QUICKLY TO UPDATE OUR ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM. AS OF APRIL TWELFTH CONSUMERS WERE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE AMERICAN AS YOU PLAN SUBSIDIES FOR COVERAGE STARTING THE FIRST. ALSO IN APRIL WE AUTOMATICALLY REPROCESSED ELIGIBILITY FOR ALL OF OUR EXISTING MEMBERS RECEIVE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. IN ORDER TO LOWER THEIR BILLS BEGINNING MAY FIRST. FINALLY IN JULY WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER THE ADDITIONAL PREMIUM AND COST SHARING BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. I'LL CLOSE THIS ITEM WITH THE IMPACT TO THE STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN PROVIDING STATE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS OVER 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDED ENHANCED PREMIUM SUPPORT FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ENROLLEES WITH INCOMES BELOW 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AS YOU COMMITTEE AGENDA NOTES THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATE PREMIUMS SUBSIDY LEVELS HAVE BEEN SUBSUMED BY THE MORE GENEROUS FEDERAL PREMIUM SUBSIDIES PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. AND DUE TO THE RAPID IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL BENEFITS IN OUR SYSTEM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY EXPENDITURES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE PERIOD. OF JANUARY THROUGH APRIL. RICH FROM MAY FIRST ON HIS. WILL RECEIVE FEDERAL PREMIUM ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD EVENING DIANA DOUGLAS ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATEWIDE HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION IS ESTABLISHING STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES IN TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION IN KEEPING OUR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET PLACE AFFORDABLE IN FACT THE RECENT FEDERAL EXPANSION OF PREMIUM SUBSIDIES WHICH WILL ENSURE NO ONE PAYS MORE THAN A HALF PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME TOWARDS PREMIUMS. BUILT UPON% CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABILITY WORK WELL WE WELCOME THE INCREASED FEDERAL ASSISTANCE WE ALSO URGE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAINTAIN THEIR COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH COVERAGE IN OUR HIGH COST OF LIVING STATE THIS MEANS A RE PURPOSING OUR EXISTING PREMIUM SUBSIDY INVESTMENTS WHICH WILL BE SUPPLANTED BY FEDERAL FUNDS TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARDS AFFORDABILITY IN THE CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. BUT THE STATE OUT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE EXCELLENT PROGRESS IN READING AND MONTHLY PREMIUM COSTS ARE STILL REAL AFFORDABILITY NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES SUCH AS DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET. THE PERSON MAKING THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR WHOSE AND ROLLED IN A STANDARD SILVER AND HAS A DEDUCTIBLE OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHICH EQUALS MORE THAN A MONTH OF THEIR SALARY NEARLY A THIRD OF PEOPLE IN THIS INCOME RANGE CHOOSE BROWN'S PLANTS DEDUCTIBLES OVER SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. OUR PROPOSAL OUTLINES POSSIBLE ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CARSHARING OPTION ONE USES THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF COST SHARING REDUCTIONS IMPROVES UPON IT BY LEVELING UP ALL COVERED CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES MAKING UNDER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. POVERTY TO THE NEXT MOST GENEROUS COST SHARING TIER. FOR EXAMPLE IN RELEASE SINCE OVER EIGHTY SEVEN WITH A FIFTEEN DOLLAR COPAY WOULD GET A BUMP UP TO SILVER NINETY FOUR AND HAVE ONLY A FIVE DOLLAR COPAY FOR DOCTOR VISITS. EVERYONE IN THE JUNE 524100% POVERTY RANGE WOULD UPGRADE INTO GOLD COST SHARING WITH ZERO DEDUCTIBLES. ALTERNATIVELY OPTION TWO WOULD TAKE A SIMPLE APPROACH TO LEVEL OUT ALL DEDUCTIBLES TWO ZERO. RELEASE BELOW 4100% OF POVERTY AND LOWER COPAYS FOR JUST SOME INCOME LEVELS. EITHER OF THESE OPTIONS WOULD GO JUST A REALLY LONG WAY TOWARDS ENSURING CALIFORNIANS CAN USE THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE AND WILL ALSO HELP ENCOURAGE. NEW PEOPLE TO ENROLL WHO RIGHT NOW MIGHT BE JUST HEARD WHEN THEY SEE DEDUCTIBLES IN THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. EITHER OPTION WOULD BE FULLY FUNDED BY OUR EXISTING STATE AFFORDABILITY INVESTMENTS- COUPLED WITH JUST SOME PORTION OF THE REVENUE FROM THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY. LOWER IN COST SHARING IS A NEEDED STEP TO HELP CONSUMERS ARE ALSO OTHER OPTIONS AND STATE COULD PURSUE. FOR EXAMPLE REDIRECTING STATE SUBSIDIES TO ZERO OUT PREMIUMS EARNED ZERO DEDUCTIBLES FOR EVERYONE I'M SORRY YOUR OUT PREMIUMS FOR EVERYONE MAKING UNDER 2100% OF POVERTY- THIS WOULD GO BEYOND THE NEW FEDERAL SUBSIDIES AND PROVIDE MORE HELP TO CALIFORNIANS WERE JUST ABOVE THE MEDIC CAL THRESHOLD ON THEIR PREMIUMS. FINALLY IS A SEPARATE ISSUE WERE ALSO CHAMPIONING A MODEST PROPOSAL UNDER TO MAKE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THAT WOULD OFFER TRUE. ZERO PREMIUMS IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT IS ALL. STATE SUBS TO COME THE ONE. REMEMBER MONTH PREMIUM THAT IS CURRENTLY. FOR STATE OR COVERS. RESEARCHERS ON THE ANY PREMIUM NO MATTER HOW SMALL DETERS ENROLLMENT IN HEALTH PLANS. THIS ONE DOLLAR PREMIUM ALSO RESIDE IN MINISTRY TO FROM BLACK THAT IS A CHALLENGE FOR AUTO ENROLMENT TRANSITIONS BETWEEN MEDIC HAL AND COVER CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA PROVIDED PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR ADDITIONAL PORTABILITY ASSISTANCE AND WE'RE EXCITED THAT CALIFORNIA CAN AGAIN TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE. ESPECIALLY IN OUR HIGH COST OF LIVING STATE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEM TO MOVE ON. WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THIRTY POINT WHERE WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY- I WILL BE COVERING THAT THE QUESTION FEWEST REGARD AFFECT- INCREASE THE COST SHARING REDUCTION ON ENROLLMENT- BUT IT HAS SHOWN THAT HE AFTER PREMIUMS THE NEXT MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN WHETHER SOMEONE WILL ENROLL IS THAT OUT OF POCKET COSTS THAT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT FACTOR THAN WHAT BENEFITS ARE COVERED WHETHER THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE OR WHETHER THERE ARE THE DOCTORS THAT THEY WANT TO BE AVAILABLE IN THE NETWORK. IN FACT. CORNIA PREVIOUSLY AB EIGHTEEN AND WERE ALL. MOSCOW ON THE TEN COREY FOR A COST SHARING. THAT WOULD BE OUT OF POCKET COSTS- AND HE'D SHOW A BUMP IN ENROLLMENT NOT AS SIGNIFICANT AS REDUCING PREMIUMS. HOWEVER I THINK IT'S A AT TO LOOK ONLY AT THE INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT WHEN LOOKING AT WHAT IT DOES TO DECREASE OUT OF POCKET COSTS. BECAUSE STUDIES ALSO SHOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THE COST OF THEIR CARE EVEN IF THEY'RE COVERED THANK YOU LATE THINKING TREATMENT THEY DON'T GET PRESCRIPTION FILLED THEY DELAYED PATH- AND OTHERWISE JUST DON'T GET THE CARE THEY NEED IN OTHER WORDS HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS. THIRD THE CONTENDED PURPOSE TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING CARE- WHAT WHAT THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY IS WITH. PAY A 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. NOW UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN THEY HAVE INCREDIBLY GENEROUS- PREMIUM- EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION OF THE PREMIUMS WHEN IT HAPPENS YOU PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT SOMEBODY INCOME IS AT THAT RATE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE FULL TIME WORKERS UNDER THE CURRENT MINIMUM WAGE. THEIR TAKE HOME PAY IS DONE OVER A FEW THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH THAT'S GROSS BEFORE TAXES. EVEN WITH CAPPING IT OUT 2% OF THEIR INCOME WHILE FORTY DOLLARS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LARGE PREMIUM WHEN THEY LOOK AT WHAT THEY CAN GET FOR FORTY THREE DOLLARS THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE AND BUSINESS WAYS COST SHARING REDUCTION CURRENTLY THE ENHANCE. THE OVER SEVENTY THREE PLANTS- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU CAN ADD ANOTHER L. AFTER YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR HOUSE BEING YOUR FOOD IN YOUR TRANSPORTATION AND THINGS THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT THEY ARE FLOATING CALIFORNIA. CERTAINLY HEALTHCARE START TO FEEL LIKE A GAMBLE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SHOULD I TAKE A FORTY TWO DOLLAR MONTHLY BILL AND THEN I KNOW WHEN IF I NEED TO GET THE KING CARE I MAY BE FACED WITH A DEDUCTIBLE THAT HIGHER THAN MY MONTHLY INCOME. THAT FEELS LIKE SILLY MONEY AND. NOT A GOOD VALUE TO PEOPLE. NOW THIS IS A CALL AND COVER CAL. OR HOW THIS IS GOING WITH DESIGN TO WORK. I'M INVOLVED IN THE PLAN TO WITH COME CAL. TWENTY FOUR. AND THAT'S FIRST FOURTEEN PLAN THERE DID. FOR THIS GROUP OF. WITH HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT'S LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT IT CURRENTLY IS. BUT LIKE. IN CAL. THAT HAVE GONE UP. ONLY THE CALL GONNA EVEN. THE THEY HAVE FOR HOW AND OTHER THINGS. SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AFFECT. THERE ARE OFTEN MADE RATIONAL DECISION AND OTHER TODAY GOING. CARE BECAUSE JUST CAN'T AFFORD ENOUGH BELL OR THEIR- SEEING THE BRONZE PLAN WHICH FOR MANY OF THEM AT THE DOLLAR PLAN NOW. AND THINKING OKAY I'LL GET THAT DONE. BUT THEY NEVER PLANNED ON. USING THEIR CARE. FOR A BIT MORE CONSTRUCTIVE HE- PEOPLE WHO ARE AT A HUNDRED AND THE POVERTY LEVEL IF THEY HAVE KIDS THEIR KIDS ARE LIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE AND UNDER MEDICARE WE DON'T IMPOSE THESE KIND OF OUT OF POCKET COSTS ALL OF THE CARRIAGE GREET THE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS KAPPLER. OCT BOB AND IT COMPARES LITTLE BIT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT- HE REALIZED FIVE EIGHTY FOUR AND THE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND THRESHOLD. WELL AND THAT WILL YOU KNOW IF WE EVER GET HER FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN AN INCREASE IN MINIMUM WAGE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR JUST OVER. I'M ALLEVIATE INDIVIDUAL THEY CAN'T GET THAT ENHANCE OVER AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE FACED WITH A FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE AND NOT ONLY THAT IT. EXCEL PREMIUM. SO IN SHORT WHILE THE M. RESCUE PLAN HAS MADE HUGE AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS FOR CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING PREMIUMS AT THE PLATE THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT ENVISION PAYING- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET THE CARE ONCE THERE AND ALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER HERBERT. WHERE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARK HERBERT WITH SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY WE ARE A SMALL BUSINESS EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND WILLIE WE EXISTS TO HELP ENTREPRENEURS TAKE THEIR NEXT UP ON THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY YOUR CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OVER FOUR MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES. FOUR MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES I 99% OF BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA ARE SMALL. AND EMPLOYEE COSTS THE WORK FORCE AND THE BUSINESS IS CREATING MOST OF THE JOBS HAVE LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES. AND THE REALLY TINY BUSINESSES- EIGHT THAT WILL WITH LESS THAN TEN EMPLOYEES CONSTITUTE 80% OF ALL CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND IT'S THESE REALLY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE HAVING THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME AFFORDING INSURANCE IN THE SMALL GROUP MARKET FOR THEMSELVES. AND THEIR EMPLOYEES. ONLY ABOUT HALF ARE ABLE TO DO SO. YOU TOO ARE PULLING EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THE INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE COVER CALIFORNIA ANOTHER MARKET PLACES ACROSS THE CROSS THE COUNTRY WERE ESSENTIAL- FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THEIR EMPLOYEES AND SELF EMPLOYED ENTREPRENEURS WE ESTIMATED THAT ROUGHLY HALF OF ALL THE FOLKS. IN THE MARKET PLACE I'M OR ONE OF THESE THREE CATEGORIES. THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE- AS SINCE CALIFORNIA'S TAKING THE LEAD TO EXPAND SUBSIDIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE AVERAGE IN MEDIAN INCOME FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WAS AROUND IS AROUND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHICH PUTS THEM RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX ON A PERCENT FPL- GAP THAT WHICH THE STATE STEPPED IN TO FILL THE AMERICAN. RECOVERY PLAN IS HOUSE THAT DIDN'T DISPEL AND OUT WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY. THE EXPANSION OF SUBSIDIES TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HERE IN THE STATE- WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA ACTORS HAVE A HUGE SAY IN HOW AFFORDABLE COVERAGE CALIFORNIA IS MOVING FORWARD. THAT'S BECAUSE THE WHAT'S HAPPENED% THIS PAST YEAR ACCORDING TO OUR POLLING ROUGHLY THIRTY THREE PERCENT. OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY HAD TO DROP. HEALTH INSURANCE WERE REDUCED HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND THAT'S EVEN MORE ACUTE WHEN WE TALKED ON SPLURGE COLOR BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY PERCENT. OF AHCH TOWARDS OF COLOR HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT DROPPING HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE OF COST OVER THIS PAST YEAR. AND EVEN LOOKING FORWARD ROUGHLY 16% OF BUSINESSES I THINKING THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DO THAT- AND AGAIN THAT IS EVEN MORE ACUTE. FOR UNDER RESOURCE ENTREPRENEURS ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT ROUGHLY 60% OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE NOT RETURNED TO PRE PANDEMIC EMPLOYEE LEVELS. SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS THE POTENTIALLY BE ABLE TO ACCESS SOME SORT OF SMALL GROUP PLAN- AND THE LAST PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IS WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN AN EXPLOSION OF SMALL BUSINESS STARTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND OVER 20% INCREASE FROM THE YEAR BEFORE- AND SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ENTREPRENEURS AS THEY STARTED BUSINESSES AND PSYCHIC BECOMES. A MORE. ROBUST BUSINESS THAT'S ABLE TO PROVIDING I'M- THOSE. ARE ABLE ACCESS AND AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTH INSURANCE. THROUGH COVERED HEALTH. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDA. SMALL BUSINESSES IN OXNARD TRYING TO STAKE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND COVER CALIFORNIA PANDEMICS MADE EVEN MORE CHALLENGING FOR REALLY SMALL BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE THAT SMALL GROUP COVERAGE- AND WITH NEW BUSINESS STARTS COMING INTO THE MARKETPLACE IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST IN INCREDIBLY AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA MARKETPLACE SO. SHE GOT RICH DANTE SHARE THE SMALL BIZ RESPECTIVE AND- PICTURE TIME. I THINK US DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING UNLESS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. OKAY THE L. A. O. FIVE VAN JOHNSON WITH THE L. A. O. JUST QUICKLY NOTE THAT AS THE AGENDA AND THE SPEAKERS HAVE HAVE SHARED- THAT THE NEW FEDERAL SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN TO USE FULLY SUBSUMES- THE STATE PROGRAM AT LEAST FOR MOST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND PART OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO PRESENTING THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY THAT I THINK A LOT OF THE ADVOCATES OF SPOKEN UP TODAY- FURTHER ENHANCING- THE STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM THROUGH LOWERING PREMIUMS DEDUCTIBLES AND SO FORTH. OR ACTUALLY ALSO TO RE DIRECTING THIS GENERAL FUND FUNDING CURRENTLY ALLOCATED TO THE STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM TO OTHER PURPOSES THAT'S ALL THANK YOU OKAY IS L. A. O. HAVE A POSITION ON- ON THE- FRONT. APPS NOT WE WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE'S PREROGATIVE JUST THAT- JUST THAT YOU HAVE FLEXIBILITY BEFORE YOU IN WHICH DECISION THAT YOU MAKE. OKAY M. BACK TO- BUT CLINTON IN A FOR SECOND THE COVER CALIFORNIA. DO I MEAN DO THE NUMBERS I'M I'M THINKING REALLY PAN OUT THAT THE HIGHER THE DEDUCTIBLE THE LESS CARE AT THAT IS YOU UTILIZED. YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE DATA AT MY FINGERTIPS ON ON THAT TO PROVIDE TO YOU. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH- THE STAFF ON OKAY AND I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT. THANK YOU DOCTOR. A COUPLE QUESTION FIRST ABOUT COVERED CALIFORNIA SO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF. PEOPLE SAYING FOR COVER CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY SIGNED FOR THE BRONZE PLAN. AND I WISH I HAD THAT AT MY FINGER TIPS AS WELL- WE WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP. UNDER UNDER THIRD I WOULD SAY OKAY BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT- CERTAIN ABOUT ANY SO FIRST OF ALL REALLY HAPPY THAT THIS IS THAT THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT STEPPING AND- I AGAIN I WANT TO POINT OUT AND DAY COVERED CALIFORNIA WITH OUR WITH OUR OWN STATE SUBSIDIES. TO DATE FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW- THE AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE TO COVER CALIFORNIA'S BEEN UNDER 1% TWO YEARS IN A ROW WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IS THIRD YEAR- HOPEFULLY WITH- WITH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN BILL WILL CONTINUE. THAT TREND WILL CONTINUE. SO IN TERMS OF FORD ABILITY I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS IS ACTUALLY BE SURE EVERYONE'S IN THE POOL- THE RESULTS ASKING OXYGEN BRONZE PLAN IS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WHAT QUALITY CONCERNS IS THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD. I MEAN THE BRONZE PLAN I KNOW IT'S THEIR ACTUAR RATES ARE UP BUT THE COAT YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION IS VERY HIGH. HE KEEPS THE PREMIUMS LOW BUT WE PARTICULARLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS ACTUALLY- LOOKING AT THE BRONZE PLANS THEY WILL HAVE SOMEONE I CAN AFFORD BUT THEN FINDING OUT THEY CAN'T. YOU KNOW THE COST SHARING SO HIGH THAT THEY ACTUALLY CAN GET SERVICES THEY NEED ESPECIALLY FOR ON GOING HEALTHCARE SO. THE DEGREE THAT WE CAN INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE AND MAKE THE SILVER PLAN OR THE OTHER PLANS MORE COMPETITIVE THE BRONZE PLAN I THINK IT'S- WOULD WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL AND I KNOW THE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THAT. CALL CALIFORNIA. I JUST ADD BULK OF OUR ENROLLMENTIS IN THE SUBURBS. OKAY GNL. OF THAT FEDERAL COST SHARING SUBSIDIES IN THAT PLAN. AND IN GENERAL WE DO. ADVERTISE AND DO OUR EACH OUR MEMBERS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYONE WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR COST SHARING REDUCTIONS USES THE SILVER PLANS VERY IMPORTANT TO US OBVIOUSLY IS THAT OUR MEMBERS CAN TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE FEDERAL BENEFITS. BOTH ON THE PREMIUM SIDE IN THE CRUSHING SIDE. OKAY EXCELLENT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW THE YOU HAVE THE ANSWER THE QUESTION OR ACCESS FINANCE SO THE SUBSIDIES FOR THE AMERICAN RESCUE. PLAN HOW LONG DO THEY LAST FOR. THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES LAST THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO THERE'S A SPECIAL BENEFIT ALSO FOR INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IT'S JUST FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ALL RIGHT SO THIS I MEAN THIS LITERALLY IS ONLY FOR A YEAR. SO SO I'VE I GUESS WE JUST THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND I KNOW THAT WHEN WE- FUNDED THE STATE'S OF THESE WATER THINGS YOU WANNA TRY TO DO IS- NOT HAVE PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR A PLAN AND HAVE YOU KNOW THE SUBSIDY. GOING BACK IN FOR HIM CERTAINLY YEAH WE WANNA BE SURE THAT PEOPLE GET SEVENTIES THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN BUT IF THAT EXPIRES AND CONGRESS IS NOT ABLE TO EXTEND IT. WE MAY HAVE TO STEP BACK IN- WITH OUR SUBSIDY I'D HATE FOR US TO FALL OFF A CLIFF THERE. AND SO JUST IN TERMS OF LONGER TERM PLANNING- I'M HOPING THAT WE BUILDING WE'RE BUILDING THAT OUT IN THE OUT YEARS THAT- IN CASE THAT HAPPENS THAT PART WE RESUME OUR STATE SUBSIDIES SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE A CONSISTENT. EXPERIENCE I DON'T PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR THE PLANET SOMEBODY HAVING SOME OF THESE YANKED OUT FROM UNDER THEM. AND IF I NEED TO DO I COMMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU MADISON CHAPEL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

AND AT ELEVEN THIRTY WELL WE AGREE WITH MANY OF THE GOALS OF THE AFFORDABILITY PROPOSAL THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW IT'S WRITTEN THAT COULD IMPACT CHILDREN ESPECIALLY CARE AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF DRUG TREATMENT APPROVED TWO YEARS AGO TO TURN OFTEN FATAL MUSCLE WASTING CONDITION INTENT OCT TWO MILLION DOLLARS PER CHILD TO ADMINISTER. OUR PATIENTS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE REATMENT LIKE THAT UNDER BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW BUT JUST A HANDFUL OF CASES A YEAR AT A COST COULD EASILY PUSH A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OR THEIR SECTOR OVER A COSTS ARE GET. WILL BE OFFICE BE EMPOWERED TO ESTABLISH THE COVERS FOR NEW HIGH COST TREATMENTS LIKE THIS ONE WHAT A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BE EXPECTED TO SEEK APPROVAL BEFORE ADMINISTERING ANY TREATMENT. WOULD THEY BE REQUIRED TO OFFER IT WITHOUT KNOWING IF THEY BE PENALIZED AFTER THE FACT WILL THEY BE EXPECTED TO LIMIT ACCESS TO COSTLY TREATMENTS LIKE THIS ONE IN ORDER TO STAY WITHIN THEIR TARGET. WILL STATE AND FEDERAL LAW THE ADJUSTED TO MAKE THAT IND OF RATIONING LEGAL. NONE OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE CURRENTLY ANSWERED BY EITHER PROPOSAL BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS LIKE THESE IN THE COMING WEEKS PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS AND OUR PATIENT A DIFFICULT THE WON'T LIMIT LIMIT ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND LIFE SAVING CARE THANK YOU.

HI TO PERMANENTLY VERY COMMITTED TO AFFORDABILITY CAN WE ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE IN THE CONCEPT AND COULD BE DEPORTED WE ARE SIMPLY SEEKING AMENDMENT THAT WOULD RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF THE BILL. UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU FLIPPING MESSAGES ON ONE HAND THE BILL CALLS FOR A MOVE AWAY FROM COPLEY AND FRAGMENTED FEE FOR SERVICE CARE AND AWAY FROM HERE THAT WILL WORK VOLUMES AND NOT VALUE AND IT ALSO PROMOTES THE ADOPTION OF NON CLAIMS BASED PAYMENT MODELS THAT REWARD EFFICIENT HIGH QUALITY CARE. AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND THE BILL DISREGARD THE VALUE THAT FULLY INTEGRATED SYSTEM PROVIDES BY NOT PERMITTING ME OFF WITH TO ESTABLISH A TOP TARGET USING A TOTAL COST OF CARE METRIC AND THIS MAKES VERY LITTLE SENSE IT JUST REINFORCES THE HEALTH CARE SILOS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE TODAY AND WILL DISCONTENT INVITED BE DEFICIENT PAYMENT MODELS. BY FORCING INTEGRATED SYSTEMS TO BE HELP YOU FACTORS THAT THAT THAT TARGET INSTEAD OF BEING MEASURED ON A GLOBAL BASIS WE CONTINUE TO BE PUZZLED BY THE INHERENT CONFLICT IN THE BILL GIVEN THE STATED GOAL. AND FINALLY WE ARE ALSO TROUBLED BY LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME CREDITS ADDITION GROUPS TO SUBMIT VERY SENSITIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT TO THE OFFICE.
