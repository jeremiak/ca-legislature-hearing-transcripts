NINETEENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE -- AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MEMBERS TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM BUT I KNOW THAT THEIR NUMBER SENATORS THAT HAVE. MEETINGS TO CHAIR SO WE WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND I'M GONNA CALL FOR ALL MEMBERS AND ASK THE SERGEANTS TO PLEASE CALL MEMBERS DOWN TO ROOM. ONE TWENTY SIX BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND WITH THAT LIKE TO CALL UP SENATOR HILL. FILE ITEM SIX SB. THREE TWENTY SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE. FOR THEIR THAT DEDICATED WORK HARD WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND I GLADLY ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WHICH FURTHER CLARIFY THAT SB THREE TWENTY SIX DOES NOT PRECLUDE AN H. O. A BOARD FROM FULFILLING THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER SB. EIGHT HUNDRED I HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FIND LANGUAGE THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO ALL PARTIES AND HOPE THIS AMENDMENT BRINGS US TO A FINAL CONSENSUS. SB THREE TWENTY SIX BUILDS UPON LAST YEAR'S SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WHICH I AUTHORED TO ADDRESS BALCONY EXPERT INSPECTIONS AND REPAIRS FOR APARTMENT BUILDINGS FOLLOWING THE DEADLY. TWENTY FIFTEEN BERKELEY BALCONY COLLAPSE THAT KILLED SIX AND INJURED. SEVEN SB THREE TWENTY SIX REQUIRES AN EXISTING CONDOMINIUM BUILDINGS GOVERNED BY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS HAVE INSPECTIONS AT LEAST ONCE EVERY NINE YEARS ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BALCONIES. STAIR WELLS AND OTHER EXTERIOR ELEVATED L. ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THEY ARE SAFE. SB THREE TWENTY SIX ALSO PREVENTS BUILDERS FROM PLACING LANGUAGE IN AN H. ALWAYS COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS RCC AND HOURS. THAT WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE H. AWAY BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SUE THE DEVELOPER IF THERE ARE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION THE CASES CURRENTLY BEING LITIGATED IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE A ROUTINE WATER LEAK REVEALED THAT A MAIN WALKWAY ON THE THIRD FLOOR. WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE DUE TO WOOD ROT WITH THE H. AWAY ATTEMPTED TO FILE A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE DEVELOPER THEY FOUND REQUIREMENTS IN THERE SHE SHE IN OURS. PLACE THERE BY THE DEVELOPER THAT REQUIRED A FULL MEMBER VOTE BEFORE THEY COULD LEGALLY SEEK DAMAGES A TOOK THE BOARD MONTHS TO CONDUCT THE MEMBER VOTE. AND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON CONSTRUCTION DEFECT DEFECT LAWSUIT NEARLY RAN OUT. THE SITUATION IS BECOMING ALL TOO COMMON THESE DEVELOPER AUTHORED PROVISIONS CAN REQUIRE AS MUCH AS AN 80% MAJORITY VOTE BEFORE THEY CAN BE SUED FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS. INCONVENIENTLY THESE PROVISIONS ARE OFTEN PRECLUDED FROM BEING REMOVED WITHOUT THE DEVELOPERS CONSENT SB THREE TWENTY SIX PRESERVE EACH H. ALWAYS RIGHT TO DECIDE HOW THEY WANT THEIR ASSOCIATION GOVERNED. BY KEEPING DEVELOPERS FROM INSERTING POISON PILL REQUIREMENTS THIS MEASURE PLACES THE DECISION MAKING POWER SQUARELY IN THE HANDS OF THE HOMEOWNERS. I DO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MISTER THANK YOU YOUR WITNESSES. YOUR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION'S INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I WANT TO ECHO THE AUTHORS STATEMENTS AND IN APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US IN AND HOPEFULLY FINDING A RESOLUTION TODAY. A TO THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD. AS WAS MENTIONED SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WAS A BILL THAT WE OPPOSE LAST YEAR. I WAS A BILL THAT SIMPLY DIDN'T FIT THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OR THE WAY COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS. ARE RUN AND DEAL WITH THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES WE COMMITTED AT THE TIME TO COME BACK TO SENATOR HILL AND WORK WITH HIM ON A BILL THAT WOULD. REALLY ADDRESSED HIS ISSUES AND OUR CONCERNS WITH GOVERNANCE AND WE BELIEVE THAT SB THREE TWENTY SIX HAS DONE THAT -- BY FINDING A VERY COMMON SENSE PRACTICAL APPROACH FOR COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS TO DEAL WITH -- ELEVATED STRUCTURES AND IN A TIMELY FASHION ADDRESS THOSE -- THAT -- POSE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE SO HOW WITH THOSE WERE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY [inaudible] OTHER WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND IN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK CAN TRIGGER A I'VE BEEN. PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE REPRESENTED BOTH PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS IN CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. LITIGATION OVER THAT TIME FRAME. AS A PRACTITIONER I FEEL THIS LEGISLATION IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER. ONE IT PROTECTS HOME BUYERS FROM DANGEROUS AND LATENT CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS IN ELEVATED STRUCTURES. AND NUMBER TWO IT PROMOTES COMPLIANCE. WITH THE PRE LITIGATION DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES. THAT ALREADY EXIST UNDER CIVIL CODE SECTION. EIGHT NINE FIVE AT SAC ALSO NOTICE TITLE. SEVEN OR THE RIGHT TO REPAIR Là WE GENERICALLY REFER TO IT AS SB EIGHT HUNDRED SENATE BILL. EIGHT HUNDRED REGULAR AND PERIODIC INSPECTIONS OF ELEVATED STRUCTURES. BY PROPERLY LICENSED AND TRAINED EXPERTS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. BECAUSE THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT APPARENT TO HOMEOWNERS. WHO DON'T KNOW? WHAT IT IS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR OR LOOKING AT? WE'VE HANDLED MANY CASES OVER -- THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS. WERE ELEVATED WALKWAYS AND BALCONIES WERE DANGEROUSLY DEFECTIVE. BUT WE'RE NOT DISCOVERED UNTIL EXPERT THE RIGHT KIND OF EXPERT. WERE CALLED IN TO INVESTIGATE THE CONDITION -- THE SECOND PIECE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS THE THE PROVISION THAT. INVALIDATE WHAT WE CALL THESE POISON PILL PROCEDURES -- SB EIGHT HUNDRED WAS DESIGNED AND INTENDED. TO PROMOTE A PRE LITIGATION DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE AN EARLY DISCUSSION AND AN EARLY RESOLUTION. OF CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE REPAIRS SOONER THAN LATER. THE POISON PILL PROVISIONS ARE DESIGNED TO THWART THAT PROCESS THAT THEY ACTUALLY UNDERMINE THE INTENT OF SB. EIGHT HUNDRED BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T. PAST THE VOTE OR YOU PASS THE VOTE TOO LATE YOU LOSE YOUR RIGHTS. SO. THAT DECISION SHOULD BE VESTED IN THE BOARD. NOT THE MEMBERSHIP -- AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THESE PROVISIONS ARE INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED AND USED IMPRESSIVELY IN LITIGATION. TO WIN THE CASE ON BEHALF OF THE DEVELOPERS BEFORE THE CASE CAN EVEN GET STARTED SO THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT -- PROVISION AS WELL AND WE APPRECIATE SENATOR HEROES SENATOR HILLS EFFORTS. ON THIS IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE AND THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION TO THE MATTER AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER. MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION. OR TWO WINNERS. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- NICK CAMERA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. BEFORE I START MY COMMENTS -- I I I I WANNA BE CLEAR ON WHAT IT IS THAT'S BEFORE US -- AND I WANNA I WANNA SAYING FIRST OF ALL THE CHAIR AND IS THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AT AND THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON THIS. HOWEVER I DID NOTICE THAT THE VERSION OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS GOING TO BE AMENDED INTO THE BILL WAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN THE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FROM WHAT I THINK WE AGREED TELL AND I JUST WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHICH ONE IS IT. I BELIEVE THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS REACHED BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND SEE I A AND R. COMMITTEE ON A SLIGHTLY AMENDED VERSION BUT I WILL LET THE AUTHOR -- IT DESCRIBE THAT IF THAT MAKES SENSE. I I HAVE THE LANGUAGE THAT I THOUGHT WAS THE LANGUAGE THAT IS BEFORE US AND I MEAN WE CAN READ IT BUT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE THAT YET IF YOU MAYBE YOU THINK WHAT'S THE DISTRIBUTED PART. MAYBE WHAT I SHOULD JUST AS READ BUT I THINK WE HAVE IT'S ONE SENTENCE AND AND IT'S IN THE SUB DIVISION II. OF SECTION TWO OF THE BILL. AND IT ELIMINATES THE SECOND SEXY THE SECOND SET SENS IN THAT SECTION. AND IT REPLACES IT WITH. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL AFFECT ANY OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF AN ASSOCIATION CONTAINED IN TITLE. SEVEN COMMENCING WITH SECTION EIGHT NINETY FIVE OF PART TWO DIVISION. TWO OR OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE ASSOCIATION CCAR'S RELATED TO ARBITRATION OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES THAT'S MY UNDERSTAND A LANGUAGE THAT I THINK ALL THE PARTIES INCLUDING THE COMMITTEE STAFF WRITER. TO THANK YOU GREAT -- AT AS PROMISED IN OUR IN OUR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE A WE WILL BE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS RIGHT THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRIAN PLANT I AM THE MANAGING PARTNER OF PLANT Là PHOBIC L. L. P.. WERE A LITIGATION LAW FIRM WITH OFFICES IN IRVINE SAN FRANCISCO AND PHOENIX. I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING HOME BUILDERS THANK YOU AND CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION. EXCUSE ME FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION ONLY TO SECTION TWO OF THE BILL. I'VE GOT THREE POINTS THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE. FIRST I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM -- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SECTION TWO OF THE BILL IS ABOUT HOMEOWNERS I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT BUILDERS. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER ENTRY AREA I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT. PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS WANTING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GET THESE CASES INTO LITIGATION BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY. AS THE COMMITTEE KNOWS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOT HOW TO CURB CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION OVER THE YEARS. AND THE ENACTMENT OF SB EIGHT HUNDRED WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFORTS. WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS IS THAT IT HASN'T HAD THE EFFECT THAT EVERYBODY INTENDED? AND THE PROBLEM IS WHEN REPAIRS ARE ACTUATED PLAINTIFFS CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWYERS DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY. THEY WORK ON A CONTINGENCY FEE BASIS AND THEY ONLY MAKE MONEY IF THESE CASES GOING TO LITIGATION AND THERE'S A CASH SETTLEMENT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. THE A THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT VOTING PROVISIONS SUCH AS THESE HAVE BEEN AROUND pFOR DECADES. AND THEY'RE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW IN FACT LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL IN THE BRANCHES CASE CONSIDERED THE EXACT VOTING PROVISION THAT SECTION TWO OF THIS BILL SEEKS TO ABOUT. H. O. A. LAWYERS IN THAT CASE MADE ALL THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT THE PROPONENTS OF SECTION TWO OF THIS BILL ARE MAKING HERE. AND THE COURT REJECTED THOSE ARGUMENTS THE COURT FOUND THAT THE PUBLIC POLICY UNDERLYING HOMEOWNER INTERESTS AND HOMEOWNERRIGHTS. AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION JUSTIFIED THESE VOTING REQUIREMENTS THE COURT WENT ON TO ADD THAT THE MINIMAL INCONVENIENCE TO AN H. O. WAY OF HAVING TO CONDUCT A VOTE BEFORE EMBARKING. ON WHAT IS A HUGE STEP IN FILING A CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWSUIT IS OUTWEIGHED BY THE BENEFITS THAT IS A FORTY TO THE HOMEOWNERS OF THESE VOTING REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT TAKES IN MY THIRD POINT THIS REALLY IS ABOUT THE HOMEOWNERS AND I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY ALL LOOKING AT ME SAYING YOU'RE A BUILDER ATTORNEY WHAT DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE HOMEOWNERS WELL I'LL TELL YOU. BUILDERS DO CARE ABOUT THEIR HOMEOWNERS AND BUILDERS CARE ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR HOMEOWNERS FROM ROW BOARDS AND FROM AMBITIOUS PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS. BUILDERS DON'T WANT THEIR COMMUNITIES TO GOING TO LITIGATION BUILDER BUILDERS DON'T WANT THEIR HOMES TO GO INTO LITIGATION LITIGATION DOESN'T HELP ANYBODY BUT THE ATTORNEYS. ANY RESULTS IF AN INCREASE HOUSING COSTS IN AND ALL READY. ON AFFORDABLE ENVIRONMENT IN MARYLAND THE VOTE PROVISION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL IT DOES IS PROVIDE CHECKS AND BALANCES ON IT H. O. WAYS OF FORTY TO ACT WHEN IT PERTAINS TO THINGS THAT THAT AFFECT THE MEMBERS AND THAT AFFECT THE MEMBERS SEPARATE INTERESTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS PROVISIONS AND PROJECTS CCAR'S THEIR RESTRICTED NATURE WAYS ABILITY TO ACT. AND JUST BECAUSE THESE DOCUMENTS ARE PREPARED BY THE HOME BUILDERS DOESN'T MEAN HE'S PROVISIONS ARE BAD IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE ON FAIR AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY DON'T BENEFIT THE HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE THEY DO. AND WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY ARE WE SINGLING OUT VOTING REQUIREMENTS ONLY FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION NOT FOR ANY OTHER KIND OF LITIGATION NOT FOR ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON A MAJOR WAYS ABILITY TO ACT PARTICULARLY WHEN IT PERTAINS TO SEPARATE INTERESTS MATTERS. FOR DOING IT BECAUSE THE LAWYERS ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GET THESE CASES INTO LITIGATION. THERE'S NOTHING PRO BUILDER ABOUT THE VOTING REQUIREMENTS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE HAS SCRUTINIZE THESE PROVISIONS FOR YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FAIR. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PUT PROVISIONS IN THAT REQUIRE MORE THAN A SIMPLE MAJORITY THE 80% FIGURE WHICH I HEARD I'VE NOT SEEN IN MY ENTIRE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF PRACTICE. THE D. R. E. WILL NOT LET WILL NOT ALLOW VOTING REQUIREMENTS THAT EXCEED A 51% SIMPLE MAJORITY THE D. R. A. WILL NOT LEAD BUILDER REPRESENTATIVES PARTICIPATE IN THE VOTE. THE G. R. E. WILL NOT LET VOTE REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO PRE LITIGATION PROCEDURES THEY ONLY APPLY TO LITIGATION ALL OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE PROPONENTS OF SECTION TWO OF THIS BILLS SEEK. ARE ALREADY IN EXISTENCE AND THE BILL GOES TOO FAR. CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION IS A HUGE DEAL FOR HOMEOWNERS IT HAS. IT HAS TREMENDOUS NEGATIVE IMPACTS IT CREATES DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. THEY HAVE DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS BUYERS CAN'T GET FINANCING EXISTING HOME OWNERS CAN'T GET REFINANCING IT'S A HUGE DEAL FOR HOMEOWNERS AND THEY DESERVE TO HAVE A SAY. BEFORE WHAT IS IN MOST CASES THEIR SINGLE LARGEST ASSET IS THROWN INTO LITIGATION. BY SOMEONE ON THEIR BEHALF WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. I KNOW IT'S A LAWSUIT CLAIMING THAT THEIR PROPERTY IS DEFECTIVE THEY DESERVE TO HAVE A SAY IN THIS AND THAT'S ALL THE VOTING REQUIREMENT DOES A AND I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS THOUGHT. IN THIS. DAY AND AGE OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY SECTION TWO OF THIS BILL TAKES A HUGE STEP BACKWARDS. WHAT IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS A SELECT FEW THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS? TO IN AN EXECUTIVE SESSION. IN SECRECY OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE MEMBERSHIP. TO MAKE A DECISION TO INITIATE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION A DECISION WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE HUGE RAMIFICATIONS AS OUR COURT OF APPEAL NOTED IN THE BRANCHES CASE. ON THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS AND BEAR IN MIND THAT THE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS DOING THIS UNDER THE AUSPICES MISTER BEFORE WE LOSE A QUORUM I LIKE TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT ESTABLISH A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY. CHIU HERE TO HEAR DEEP DEEP HERE GABRIELLE. GLORIA GLORIA HERE KILEY KILEY HERE THE MONTH. THE MONTH HERE MAIENSCHEIN QUIRK SILVA WE HAVE A QUORUM AND SIR IT LIKE TO ASK IF YOU COULD WRAP UP SHORTLY IF YOU CAN YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WELL. WHAT SECTION TWO OF THIS BILL DOES IS IT ALLOWS A SELECT GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS IN AN EXECUTIVE SESSION IN SECRECY OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE HOMEOWNERS? TO MAKE A DECISION UNILATERALLY THAT WILL IMPACT THOSE HOMEOWNERS AND THEIR INVESTMENT FOR YEARS TO COME. AND BEAR IN MIND THAT THEY'RE MAKING THAT DECISION UNDER THE AUSPICES OF ADVICE OF COUNSEL. COUNSEL WHO DOESN'T REPRESENT THE HOMEOWNERS WHO ONLY REPRESENTS THE H. AWAY AND ITS BOARD MEMBERS. THE ONLY PROTECTION TO HOMEOWNERS HAVE IS THE VOTING REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC -- ALSO OPPOSE THIS BILL. SEEN ON LET'S BRING BACK TO DISCUSSION -- COLLEAGUES ANY DISCUSSION. I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- FOR ENGAGING IN THIS CONVERSATION I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A PASSION OF YOURS CERTAINLY AFTER THE TRAGEDY. IN RECENT YEARS AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND AND MOVING -- WHAT YOU DID A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE CONTEXT OF -- THE APARTMENT BUILDINGS THAT REQUIRED INSPECTIONS ABOUT KINNEY'S TO PROTECTIONS AND COMMON INTERESTS DEVELOPMENTS. I ALSO DO THINK. THAT YOU HAVE STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE -- HERE WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING WHAT HAS BEEN A BIT OF A POISON PILL I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE AUTHOR WITH C. B. I A AND OTHERS IN OUR OFFICE -- I KNOW IT TOOK A BIT OF TIME BUT I THINK THAT THE CONCLUSION POLITICALLY TO PROTECT -- THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEDIATION AND ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- CERTAINLY HERE -- AND APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OPPONENT -- BUT WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT -- EVERY RESIDENT IN ONE OF THESE COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS WILL RECEIVE NOTICE OF THE DECISION MADE BY THE BOARD -- AND SO WITH THAT I AM PREPARED -- TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TODAY -- ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. THERE'S BEEN A MOTION WITH THE BILLS ARE SECOND. THERE'S BEEN A SECOND. SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A FINAL AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND OUR THANKS TO BE A FOR WORKING. DILIGENTLY HARD FEE AND IT SOMETIMES -- IN A VERY DIFFICULT -- MANNER AND IT -- A LITTLE FRUSTRATING FOR I THINK ALL OF US AND BUT IT WORKED AT THE END IN AND THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB AND THEY DO REPRESENT -- THE BUILDERS OF THE STATE AND I I RESPECT THEM FOR THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE AS WELL THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU SENATOR -- WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY TO HI CHIU I DEEP. I GABRIELLE GLORIA. GLORIA I KILEY. KILEY NO LIMóN. LIMóN I MAIENSCHEIN QUIRK SILVA. YOU HAVE FOUR VOTES YOU NEED ONE MORE TO GET IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN UNTIL OTHER MEMBERS AWRY FEATURED THANK YOU CALLING. IT VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER. OUR NEXT ITEMS WILL BE. PRESENTED BY CENTERS WHITE HOUSE SKI ODDS ITEMS TWO AND FIVE I'LL SOON MAYBE I'LL TAKE FILE ITEM TO FIRST IN THE FOLLOWER SB THIRTEEN S. [inaudible] SENATOR. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS -- MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING TO PROPOSE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS -- THIS IS SIDE SB THIRTEEN WHICH IS ADDRESSES SOME OF THE TOP EREADERS -- TO EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING A TO INCLUDE -- REDUCING IMPACT FEES -- STRENGTHENING -- THE HOUSING COMING DEVELOPMENT OVERSIGHT ELIMINATING OWNER OCCUPANCY AND PROVIDING A SAFE PATH FOR ALLOWING I'M PERMITTED EIGHTY USE BROUGHT UP TO CODE. I WANT TO ASSURE EVERYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE THAT THESE THAT THE CHECKS AND THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS NOT MADE UP IN A VACUUM IT'S PART OF THE HEARINGS THAT WERE HELD BETWEEN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND THE HOUSING BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT. IDENTIFYING SPECIFICALLY WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS THAT STILL EXIST -- TO EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENT WE HAVESIGNIFICANT STUDIES THAT IT FROM PLACES LIKE THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ AND UC BERKELEY TO TURN A REPORT THAT'S QUOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT DEVELOPMENT FEES. ARE EXCESSIVELY HIGH FOR EIGHTY USE FOR INSTANCE UC BERKELEY FOUND THAT SOME LOCALITIES ARE CHARGING AS MUCH AS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PR UNIT. AND THAT NUMBER DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE IMPACT FEES CHARGED BY UTILITY COMPANIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHER DISTRICTS. SO MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO BILL NEEDY YOU ARE SIMPLY STOPPED IN THEIR TRACKS WHEN THEY'RE HANDED THESE -- THESE FEE REQUEST EIGHTY USER BUILT ON LOTS THAT HAVE ALREADY PAID THEIR DEVELOPMENT FEES WHAT WE'VE DONE IN A SERIES OF FORTY YEARS WE HAVE THEIR CALL DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES. AND WHEN WE HAD LANGUAGE THAT USES SECONDARY UNIT CITIES AND COUNTIES SAID -- THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THIS IS A NEW STRUCTURE SO WE'RE GONNA CHARTS AND THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE AND WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND CITIES ALLOWED OUT WERE ALLOWED TO DO IT. WILL. THE CITY OF LIVERMORE IT'S TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN IMPACT FEE AND WE WONDER WHY WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THEY JUST PASS IT ON AND PART OF THE DEFINITIONAL CHANGED EXCESS READ WALLING UNITS WAS. TO REMIND PEOPLE AND CLARIFY THAT THESE ARE EXCESS RE TO THE HOUSE THAT IS ALREADY PAID THEIR IMPACT FEES -- HOMEOWNER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THEM AGAIN SINCE THEY PAID WHEN THEY BOUGHT THE HOUSE A LITTLE ON PAY THE AMOUNT THAT'S BEING CHARGED ON THE PRIMARY UNIT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE FACT THAT A HOMEOWNER CAN EXPAND THEIR HOUSE FOR A BEDROOM A KITCHEN A BATHROOM AND THEY WOULD PAY NO. IMPACT FEES I THINK I TESTIFIED LAST YEAR MY WIFE AND I BUILT A FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FOOT ADDITION TO OUR HOUSE IT WAS A ONE DAY PERMIT. WOULD PUT IN ANOTHER KITCHEN ANOTHER -- SINK IN THE KITCHEN A SECOND STOVE A BRAND NEW BATHROOM AND EXPANDED. FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FEET NO IMPACT FEES MINISTERIAL IN THE APPROVAL. THE OPTION OPPOSITION WILL SAY AND I WANT TO ADDRESS THIS THAT WE SHOULD WAIT FOR THE STUDY ON THE GRAYSON LEGISLATION THAT IS DUE LATER ON THIS MONTH. BUT I'VE CALLED -- THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THEY HAVE TOLD ME. THAT EIGHTY USE ARE NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SURVEY SO EVEN IF THEY ARE YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT I'VE TALKED TO THE CHAIR -- AND THE OTHER EIGHTY YOU BILLS THAT ARE PROGRESSING IN THE THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE LOOK FOR A RECONCILIATION AND IF THERE'S IS LANGUAGE IN THERE WHICH I DON'T EXPECT THAT I WILL. I WILL YOU KNOW -- COOPERATE WITH A RECONCILIATION OF THOSE NUMBERS WITH THE CHAIRS ASSISTANCE. ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THIS BILL IS THAT. SB THIRTEEN PROHIBITS OWNER OCCUPANCY ORDINANCES WHICH REQUIRED THAT THE OWNER LIVE EITHER ON THE EIGHTY YOU OR IN THE PRIMARY UNIT. BUT THERE'S THIS UNFOUNDED FEAR THAT INVESTORS ARE BUYING HOUSES JUST TO BUILD EIGHTY USED TO RENT THEM OUT. AND IN REALITY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MAJORITY OF EIGHTY USE ARE BUILT BY HOMEOWNERS TO HOUSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS THE CITY OF PORTLAND DID THE DID A SURVEY OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY USE. AND FOUND THAT ONLY 10% OF THEM WERE BUILT BY INVESTORS. OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIRES REQUIREMENTS LIMIT THE MARKET BILL DVD USE AND PREVENTS THE CONSTRUCTIONS OF THEM THE BANKS OPPOSE THE OWNER OCCUPANCY BECAUSE IF THE HOUSE GOES INTO FORECLOSURE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MECHANISM TO TAKE OCCUPANCY IN ORDER TO OWN THE HOUSE -- DO WE WE DEVELOP REAL PROPERTY LOSS THAT WE HAVE TRANSFER BUILDING IT'S EASY IT'S WE WANT TO HAVE CLEAR TITLE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE TRANSFER ABILITY OF PROPERTY. THERE'S NO OTHER TYPE OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS THAT HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON ON OUR OCCUPANCY FOUR PLEX APARTMENT COMPLEXES NONE. SO -- WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE REMAINING -- BARRIERS TO EIGHTY YOU CONSTRUCTIONS EIGHTY USER SMALL. BUT THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN -- A TRIP ALLEVIATING THE HOUSING CRISIS IN WITH ME I HAVE. NEWS BURKE WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] HERE WITNESSES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL REPRESENT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS. IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA REGION. AND IF YOU TALK TO OUR SEALS HOUSING AND THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS IS THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THE REGION FOR TRACKING RETAINING WORKERS. THIS HOUSING CRISIS IS CAUSED BY THE LACK OF SUPPLY. WE NEED EIGHTY USE TO HELP FILL THAT GAP SB THIRTEEN IS IMPORTANT BILL TO HELP EXPEDITE EIGHTY USE THESE ARE HOUSING UNITS FOR TEACHERS. STUDENTS NURSES GRANDPARENTS. AND OTHERS NUMBER. TWO WE TALK ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND HOW WE WANT TO DO BETTER FOR THE CLIMATE WE NEED TO REALLY EXPAND UPON INFILL HOUSING. SB THIRTEEN WILL HELP US DO THAT. AND LASTLY GOING HERE TODAY ABOUT FOR ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. SB THIRTEEN AS A LOW CONTROL BILL IT GIVES THE CONTROL BACK TO THE PROPERTY OWNER OF LOCAL YOU CAN GET. SO GIVE HOMEOWNERS BACK CONTROL OF THEIR PROPERTY PLEASE SUPPORT SB THRTEEN TODAY. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. MR CHEN MEMBERS AARON EVANS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA A AND B.

DOES SOMEONE ELSE GIVE THERE IS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. CORNISH CHAIR MEMBERS CHASE RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES. WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY POSE LESS AMENDED WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATOR AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT -- ARE STICKING POINT REALLY REMAINS THAT THE FEES AND I ON CALL LISTEN IN AND YOU KNOW I CAN KERR WITH A LOT OF WHAT THE SENATOR SAID AROUND THE FEES IN THAT THEY ARE. YOU KNOW HIGH IN SOME SITUATIONS AND AND REALLY IT'S A FUNCTION OF MITIGATION FEE ACTS SO -- THE FEE ISN'T OR EXCUSE ME THE THE REPORT IS IMPORTANT AND WHILE THE REPORT DOES NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS EIGHTY USE -- I DON'T IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT THAT IT WOULD SINCE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MITIGATION FEE ACT AND HOW WE APPLY THAT WHEN WE IMPOSE A FEE AND THOSE FEES ARE PRIDE BROADLY TO ANY TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION -- SO IT IS A LITTLE UNNECESSARY TO FOCUS ON A SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY -- EIGHTY USE IT'LL ALL BE CAPTURED IN THAT SO -- YOU KNOW IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD HOW MANY WE CERTAINLY WANT TO CONTAIN THE CONVERSATION ON FEES THAT WE CAN HAVE AN APPROPRIATE FEE STRUCTURE -- IF WE ARE ANY PEOPLE TO THE COMMUNITY THERE WILL BE IMPACTS AND WE AS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO TO ADDRESSES IMPACTS WITH THAT WE REQUEST TO A NOBLE. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THEM JUST GO GAGA WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES HERE TODAY WITH AN OPPOSE AND LAST AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. OUR ISSUE IS VERY NARROW AND IT RELATES TO CONNECTION AND CAPACITY FEES FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE -- WE'RE REQUESTING AN AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY THAT THE IMPACT FEE LIMITATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO CONNECTION CAPACITY CHARGES FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE. THESE CHARGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE ASSESSED PROPORTIONATELY BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ANDERS -- PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AND PROP TWENTY SIX THEY ARE ALREADY THERE ARE ALREADY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE CAN ASSESS THESE FEES -- THAT FORMULA WAS DECIDED BY SB TEN SIXTY NINE IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE MOMENT WE'RE SEEKING WOULD CLARIFY THAT ARE FEES REMAIN SUBJECT TO THAT% FORMULA ESTABLISHED UNDER SB SIXTY NINE SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF AS THE BILL MOVES INTO THE NEXT MANY. ME ASK IF THERE IS OTHER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. HAVE YOU GOT TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES SENSATION ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE SIKASSO JUST ADD WE WOULD AGREE WITH THE CENTER THAT RECONCILIATION OF THE OTHER EIGHTY YOU BILLS IS.

TO THIS BILL THANK YOU -- TWENTY WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT SO SHOULD NOT MISS THE SUPPORT LINE BUT JUST ONE CLEAR FOR THE WORD SUPPORT SB. THIRTEEN LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. MISTER GORE I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE AUTHOR FOR THE COMMENT THAT DON'T QUESTION I HAD WAS TO BE EXTENDED THIS IS A DYNAMIC SITUATION THERE'S COMPETE LEGISLATION AND THERE'S THIS STUDY THAT. YOU'RE NOT HELPFUL FOR I'VE BEEN IN THAT SAME BOAT TOO BUT YOU KNOW HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL RIGHT -- BUT YOUR OVERALL COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO SORT OF GRIND OUT THIS ISSUE AND MAKE SURE WE TAKE SOME DECISIVE ACTION IS PERSONALLY MEANINGFUL TO ME. KNOWLEDGE I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL WHICH I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON THIS -- EIGHTY IS NOT GONNA BE THIS -- THE CURE ALL FOR HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK THE FEES THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPACTFUL WHETHER NOT PEOPLE CHOOSE TO PROCEED WITH A NOT. A NOT A MAN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SIDEWALK IS THE BILL THE VOTE HAS BEEN LAID -- THE POWER LINES HAVE BEEN INSTALLED -- YOU KNOW IS SHERRY WITH MY COLLEAGUE YOU KNOW MY GRANDMOTHER LIVES IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WAS BUILT SEVENTY YEARS AGO BY HERSELF SHE MOVED OUT TOMORROW. AT A LOCAL FAMILY MOVED IN THE NEXT DAY THEY WOULD NOT BE ASSESSED ANYTHING EXTRA FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE ACTIONS THAT WILL PUT MORE AND MORE ROOFS OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS AT PRICES THEY CAN AFFORD WELL MISTER RIGHT WITH SENATORS DOING IS A NATURALLY AFFORDABLE PRODUCT. I'M BY NATURE OF ITS DESIGN AND LOCATION -- THIS IS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE PUSHING TO DO -- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS AGAIN TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED -- IN THE DYNAMIC NATURE THE SITUATION BUT OVERALL I THINK THIS IS A NO BRAINER I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL MR MEASURE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THEIR WORK HOURS HE IN IN IN IN IN YOUR COMMENT YOU KNOW -- AND THAT WAS ALSO A JUST REWRITE -- MY COLLEAGUE MISTER GLORIA THE YOU SAID THAT. DE THE ORIGINAL HOMEOWNER. ALREADY PAVE ALL THE THE LOCAL IMPACT FEES SIDEWALKS OF THE STREET LAMPS. OF MY MY MY CONCERN OF COMING FROM A SPECIAL DISTRICT UP BACKGROUND IS THE CONNECTION FEES ON WHEN. WHEN? YOU HAVE NEW TENANTS -- IT'S ASSUME THAT -- INCREASING VOLUME OF TO SEE WHICH CONNECTIONS WILL WILL WILL WILL GO UP AND AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A TO BE FAIR FOR THE EFFORT SANITARY DISTRICT OR SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER. IN ALLOWING THEM TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO RECOVER -- THAT -- THAT COSTS -- MINIMALLY JUST JUST TO BE ABLE TO A CONNECTS OF THAT EIGHTY USED TO THE TO THE SEWAGE LATERAL -- AND AT THE LAST BUT MY COUNTY -- VICE CHAIR THROUGH THE THROUGH THE CHAIR IS -- CLEARLY I WILL WORK WITH THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS SO WITH THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHEN THERE'S THERE'S AN IMPACT FEE AND THEN THERE'S CONNECTION FEE CURRENTLY AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WE WROTE TEN SIXTY NINE AND WE SAID. CAN BE THE FEE COULD BE PROPORTIONAL TO WHAT THE THE MOTHER HOUSE IS IF RIGHT NOW IF THE IF YOU'RE CONNECTING TO THE MAIN LINE IN THE SIDEWALK THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT. TO CHARGE FOR THAT CONNECTION FEE IF I'M RUNNING A LINE FROM THE EIGHTY YOU TO MY HOUSE THAT'S A PLUMBER I PAY I PAY THE THE PLUMBER FOR FOR THAT THING THOSE. ENVIRONMENTAL FEES AND ALL THOSE OTHER FEES THAT YOU PAY TO THE EVERY JURISDICTION THOSE I'M NOT I'M JUST TALK TALKING ABOUT THE THE LARGE IMPACT FEE THAT'S A NO LOOK. LOOK NO LOOK CHART SO -- I AGREE WITH YOU AND AGREE WITH THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA IS THAT AS THIS SHOULD. EARN YOUR SUPPORT TODAY AND THE BILL PROCEEDS THAT I'M ABLE TO CONTINUE HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR HI. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHO HAVE BILLS IN THE SENATE TO TO WORK ON RECONCILING -- SELLING IT BUT I AM SENSITIVE TO THE THE ACTUAL FEES FOR WORK VERSUS JUST THE IMPACT THAT'S A SORT OF A NO LOOK ABOVE THE LINE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. GREAT LET ME -- IT PROVIDE A FEW OF MY OWN THOUGHTS FOR SOME MAY THINK THE SENATOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON EIGHTY YOU POLICY YOU'VE BEEN. TOILING AWAY AT THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND AND REALLY HELPING TO MOVE EIGHTY USED TO THE FOREFRONT OF BEING A MAJOR SOLUTION FOR HOUSING CRISIS AND THEIR MANY ASPECTS OF THIS BILL THAT I THINK ARE VERY NON CONTROVERSIAL. BUT TAKE SIGNIFICANT STEPS AROUND OWNER OCCUPANCY PARKING THE SIZE LOCATIONS OF EIGHTY IS SO WHEN I THANK YOU FOR THAT. AS I THINK WE ALL KNOW THERE IS ONE MAJOR ISSUE IN THIS BILL THAT. CREATES A LOT OF HEARTBURN AND THAT IS AROUND FEES -- AND LET ME SAY THIS -- TWO THOUGHTS WHICH IS I HAVE PUBLICLY STATED THAT I DO THINK WE NEED TO DO SIGNIFICANTLY REFORM ACROSS THE BOARD INCLUDING IN THE AREAS OF EIGHTY USE OF DIRECTIONALLY I AM SUPPORTIVE -- THAT BEING SAID I A AS WE'VE DISCUSSED I AM NOT YET CONVINCED THAT WHAT YOU HAVE PROPOSED IN THIS BILL AROUND EIGHTY YOU FEE REDUCTION IS EXACT LEE RIGHT FORMULA -- I THINK THEIR NUMBER POTENTIAL NUANCES THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO CREATE AND THINK ABOUT DEPENDING ON THE DISTRICTS DEPENDING ON THE TYPES OF JURISDICTION -- WHETHER 25% IS THE RIGHT NUMBER MAYBE IT SHOULD BE LARGER -- BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID -- LAST YEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE YOU HAVE THE SAME BILL AND I'D ASK YOU TO TAKE THOSE PROVISIONS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE DID REMOVE THOSE PROVISIONS. IN PART BECAUSE WE WERE AWAITING THE RESULTS OF A STUDY THAT IS GOING TO COME OUT IN A WEEK. THIS YEAR I FEEL A BIT DIFFERENTLY I DO THINK IT IS RIGHT FOR US TO TACKLE THIS THIS YEAR I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS AT THIS YEAR -- RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AMENDMENTS MAKES SENSE HERE AND THEN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION REPLICATE ITSELF IN A FEW WEEKS IN THE LOCAL GOV COMMITTEE -- I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIRWOMAN OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU AND I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH THE TWO OF US. AS WELL AS OTHER AUTHORS OF A DO YOU BILLS TO REALLY WANTS THAT REPORT COMES OUT -- TO PROVIDE A RATIONAL STRUCTURE ACROSS ALL OF THE VARIOUS FEE REDUCTION PROPOSALS -- TO ADDRESSES SO MY SUPPORT THIS BILL TO DAY -- I I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY IT IS CONDITIONAL ARE BASED ON ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND AND I KNOW WE WILL HAVE MANY OF THOSE AROUND HOW WE ENSURE. THAT WE PRODUCE EIGHTY YEARS BUT ALSO PROVIDING RESIDENTS THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED SO -- APPRECIATE THE SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS UNITE HAD ON THIS AND THE WORK WILL CONTINUE BUT AT LEAST I THINK FOR PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THIS BILL TO CONTINUE ON SO LISTENING TO OTHER QUESTIONS. I'LL RETURN IT BACK TO THE CENTER I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE GREAT -- THERE HAS BEEN A MOTION IS OUR SECOND. TO ME THIS FORTY SECOND. THERE'S BEEN A SECOND AND THAT WITH THAT MADAM. SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHIU HI. HI DAVE HI I GABRIELLE GLORIA AYE GLORIA I KILEY. KILEY IDEALLY MON [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN. QUIRK SILVA AYE QUIRK SILVA I YOU HAVE VOTES GET OUT WILL WAIT FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON AND WITHOUT CENTER YOU HAVE FILE ITEM. FIVE SB. THREE TWENTY THREE THANK YOU A FIVE IF [inaudible] MEMBERS COULD. TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF THE STAFF ANALYSIS MAY BE HELPFUL BECAUSE MOST OF MY COMMENTS WILL BE -- GEARED TOWARDS THE S. COMMITTEE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT FIRST OFF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M AGREE TO ACCEPT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IT CONTAINS THE ANALYSIS. I'M UNABLE -- TO EXCEPT THE SECOND COMMITTEE AMENDMENT -- NOT ONLY BECAUSE I'M TO LOSE THE SUPPORT OF THE THE ADVOCATES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THIS AREA FOR FOR YEARS -- BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE BILL WILL BE LEFT OVER -- TO CONTINUE TO MOVE NOW A PROPERTY MANAGER IS THE RIGHT ARM OF A OF THE BOARD AND I'VE HEARD TOO MANY STORIES FROM THE FROM THE ADVOCATES OF INSTANCES -- WHICH THE PROPERTY OWNER HAS COLLUDED WITH A CORRUPT AND DYSFUNCTIONAL BOARD AND LET'S. JUST THROW IT OUT THERE THERE'S FIFTY TWO THOUSAND HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF THESE THINGS BUT ENOUGH OUR DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES HERS IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT WE WERE TRYING TO IMPROVE THIS AND GET IT RIGHT -- THIS IS PEOPLE THAT ARE EFFECTIVE ARE OUR OUR RESIDENTS. REQUIRING THAT THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS ONLY BE PAID FOR ELECTION WERE IS ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THESE ELECTIONS THE H. O. WAYS NOW FUNCTION AS THE FACT THOUGH CITY COUNCIL SAID WITH AFFECTING PEOPLE'S. RIGHTS IT'S NOT A MATTER OF COSTS. NOT ONLY THIS IS THE OPPOSITION STATED. BEFORE IN ANOTHER IT H. AWAY LEGISLATION THAT THE COST OF AN ELECTION IS ONE TO TWO DOLLARS PER UNIT LET'S CALL IT THREE UNITS THE STAFF REPORT CLEARLY WALKS OUT THAT MOTION. MOST OF THESE ARE LESS THAN FIFTY UNITS SO IT'S NOT A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY -- BUT THEY'RE ALSO LOW COST ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS IF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS AND OTHER CIVIC MINDED NONPROFITS AS POINTED OUT IN THE ACTUAL TAX OF SECTION FIVE FIVE ONE WHICH SAYS WHICH CALLS FOR THE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY -- MAYBE A MEMBER OF THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION SO YOU CAN HAVE A MEMBER THAT WHAT WANT TO DO THE ELECTION BUT NOT A DIRECTOR A CANDIDATE -- FOR DIRECTOR AND OR BE RELATED TO DIRECTOR CANDIDATES DIRECTOR AND THE AGAIN SECTION FIVE ONE ONE ZERO SAYS THE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY -- MAY NOT BE A PERSON BUSINESS ENTITY OR SUB DIVISION OF THE BUSINESS ENTITY WHO IS CURRENTLY EMPLOYED -- UNDER CONTRACT TO THE ASSOCIATION FOR ANY COMPENSABLE SERVICES THEN THEY HAVE THAT MAGIC UNLESS THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. OUR AGREES BY BOTH TO DO IT SO SO THE BASIS OF THE LAW IS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE THIS INDEPENDENT WE PUT IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING -- TO REMOVE HERE. HI. I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THIS BILL IS NEARER THAN LAST YEAR'S BILL I WHICH PASSED THE THIS COMMITTEE AND I'LL JUST GO OVER THEM I'VE REMOVED THE PRIVACY CONCERNS FROM LAST YEAR'S BILL I DELETED THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE VOTE COUNTING. LOCATION BE ACCESSIBLE IN NEAR THE H. AWAY PROPERTY AND I'VE ALLEVIATED ALL CONCERNS FROM THE BUILDING -- INDUSTRY WHO WAS REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION. AND WITH ME IS -- JUDGE TOM SIR WITH THE CENTER OF CALIFORNIA H. AWAY LAW AND IT REGION I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR AT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW IS THE ONE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS. ADVOCATES FOR THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS IN NATURE WAYS -- THE CENTER HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE PERSON OF MARJORIE MURRAY OUR FOUNDING PRESIDENT. IN THE WRITING OF THE LEGISLATION MUCH OF THE LEGISLATION THAT PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF HOMEOWNERS INCLUDING IN THE AREA OF ELECTIONS. I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AND GOT INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF WORK. AFTER I MOVED INTO RETIRED FROM THE COURT AND MOVED INTO A LARGE SENIOR. A COMMUNITY GOVERNED BY AN H. AWAY AND LEARNED. TO BY SURPRISE THAT HI MY ASSUMPTION THAT I WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE SELF GOVERNANCE OF THAT ORGANIZATION JUST LIKE I HAD THE AND CITY GOVERNMENTS -- WHEREVER I HAVE LIVED -- AND I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT THAT WAS. AN UNWARRANTED ASSUMPTION. I'D NOTE THAT THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT. TO ELECT A BOARD AND TO RUN FOR THAT BOARD IS THOUGH SINGLE. SOVEREIGN ACT THAT A MEMBER IS AVAIL HAS IS AVAILABLE TO IN A TO AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER EVERY. OPPOSED CHANGE IN THE LAW IN THIS BILL. IS BASED UPON. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT THE CENTER RECEIVED FROM ALL AROUND THE STATE WE HAVE MEMBERS FROM ALL AROUND. EVERY COUNTY. AND WE TAKE THESE COMPLAINTS AND ANALYZE THEM AND TRY TO WORK ON FIXES. FOR THESE COMPLAINTS. AND SO THAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE LEGISLATION IT'S COMPLAINTS FROM. PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE WHO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH. OF THE ABUSE OF POWER BY THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT IS THE ORIGIN. AND SO THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU IS REALLY. UP. MAY WE MOVE FORWARD TO FIX THE FLAWS IN THE EXISTING LAW. AND TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTION PROCESS. AND SO I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIDGE THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE. BUT TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- WE'VE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE NOW FOR TWO YEARS -- WITH SENATOR IN INTO APPRECIATE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE BILL SINCE LAST YEAR. BUT WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS BILL IS SIGNIFICANTLY SIMILAR TO THE BILL THAT WAS GOT VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN LAST YEAR FOR BEING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH WHERE THE AUTHOR STATE THAT. HOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF ASSOCIATIONS? THAT HAVE TROUBLE WITH THEIR ELECTIONS THERE'S OVER FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THOSE ELECTIONS HAPPEN ON A REGULAR BASIS THEIR FAIR THEIR TRANSPARENT WE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. SET OF ELECTION LAWS FOR HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS IN THE NATION IT'S IN THE DAVIS STIRLING ACT AS WELL AS IN THE CORPORATION'S CODE BECAUSE THESE PUBLIC NOT FOR PROFIT CORPORATIONS ARE GOVERNED BY BOTH SECTIONS OF THE CODE. SB TWELVE SIXTY FIVE WAS NEARBY AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL AS IT WAS STATED. WITH FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ASSOCIATIONS AND STATE 70% OF THEM ARE FIFTY UNITS WERE LESS AND YET WE'RE MAKING. NOT CHANGES TO DEAL WITH JUST VOTER RIGHTS WERE MAKING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE ENTIRE PROCESS THAT IN MOST CASES 70% OF THE TIME ARE GENERALLY OVERSEEN. BY VOLUNTEERS. THOSE VOLUNTEERS IF THEY MAKE A MISTAKE THIS BILL. HAS CREATED THE GOTCHA AT THE END OF IT I BY CHANGING THE BURDEN OF PROOF THAT A A COURT WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT IN TODAY'S LAW. IF THERE IS A MISTAKE IN AN ELECTION AND IT HAPPENS TO GO TO COURT IT IS UP TO THE JUDGE TO BALANCE THE FACTS. OF THE CASE TO DETERMINE IF IF A MISTAKE WAS MADE WHETHER OR NOT THAT MISTAKE ACTUALLY HAD. A RESULT ON THE OUTCOME AND IF THE JUDGE DECIDES THAT AFTER BALANCING THE FACTS THEY CAN OVERTURN THE ELECTION. SB THREE TWENTY THREE TURNS OUT ON ITS HEAD BY NOW STATING THAT IT THE ASSOCIATION HAS THE BURDEN TO PROVE THAT A MISTAKE THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED DID NOT HAVE AN OUTCOME ON THE ELECTION IF THEY CANNOT PROVE THAT. MEN THE JUDGE SHALL VOID THE ELECTION SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF THE SITUATIONS WHERE MISTAKE HAVE OCCURRED THE ASSOCIATION CAN'T PROVE IT DIDN'T HAVE A AN OUTCOME RESULT ON THE OUTCOME. YET ANOTHER ELECTION AND SB THREE TWENTY THREE HAS EXTENDED THE IT'S TIME FOR THE ELECTION TO NOW OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS. THE OTHER ISSUE WITH THE BILL IS THAT IT COVERS THE ELECTION PROCESS. WOULD HAVE WHICH HAPPENS WHEN A SPECIAL ASSESSMENT TAKES PLACE WHEN A CHANGE IN THE BYLAWS TAKE PLACE WHEN A BOARD OF DIRECTORS ELECTION TAKES PLACE. BUT THE MAIN FOCUS BY THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL OR THE BOARD OF ELECTION. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ELECTIONS SO WE'VE NOW CHANGE THE PROCESS. FOR ALL THESE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE PLACE WE'VE INCREASED HE COST OF THIS ELECTION FOR ALL THESE OTHER ACTIVITIES TAKE PLACE. FOR WHAT WE'RE SEEING THEIR WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND PROBLEMS. WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ELECTIONS. THE ONE AMENDMENT THAT THE PROPONENTS THE AUTHOR ARE NOT ACCEPTING HIS RATHER SIGNIFICANT -- BECAUSE AGAIN THIS GOES TO THE ISSUE OF NOT ONLY DEALING WITH BOARD OF A LOT DIRECTOR ELECTIONS IT'S ALL ELECTIONS. SO RIGHT NOW IN SOME CASES WHERE THERE IS A COMMUNITY MANAGER THAT COMMUNITY MANAGER AS PART OF THEIR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP THEIR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ASSOCIATION MAY SERVICE THAT. INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY THE CPA. OF THE ASSOCIATION MAY SERVE THAT ROLE. THE ATTORNEY MAY STATE SERVE THAT ROLE. WITH THIS BILL AND THE CHANGES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED NONE OF THOSE ENTITIES EVEN THOSE WHO ARE STATE LICENSE HAVE CODE OF ETHICS. REGARDING CERTAIN ISSUES LIKE THIS COULD NOT SERVE IN THAT ROLE THEREFORE THE ASSOCIATION HAS NO OTHER RESPONSE OR ANOTHER ROLE BUT ACTUALLY GOING OUT AND FINDING A PROFESSIONAL. NOW THERE MAY BE VOLUNTEERS TO COULD DO THIS. BUT UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION CURRENT ELECTION RULES IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT LET'S DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE ELECTION IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE LET'S ADD ADDITIONAL STEPS LET'S ADD ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS BY THIS INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY. INVESTIGATOR OF ELECTIONS AND NOW ASK OF ALL INTO YOUR TO DO IT WE'RE ONLY GOING TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE MISTAKES WHEN CREATE OPPORTUNITIES WERE MORE ELECTIONS ARE GONNA BE AVOIDED. AND INCREASING COSTS. FINALLY TO THE POINT OF THE BUDGETS AGAIN. 70% SO STATION STATE A CALIFORNIA FIFTY UNITS FOR LESS 53% THE ASSOCIATION'S CALIFORNIA HAVE BUDGETS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS THOSE BUDGETS ARE PAID FOR BY THE HOMEOWNERS. THOSE BUDGETS ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE OPERATION OF THE ASSOCIATION THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPERTY THE MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY VALUES SO EVERY ADDITIONAL DOLLAR THAT GOES TO SOME OTHER PROCESS. THAT IS NOT WARRANTED ESPECIALLY ON A STATEWIDE BASIS IMPACTING FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ASSOCIATIONS WHAT ULTIMATELY COST HOMEOWNERS ADDITIONAL MONEY AND IN A TIME IN A STATE WHERE WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOMEOWNERS AND HOMEOWNER AFFORDABILITY. WE JUST THINK THAT SB. THREE TWENTY THREE IS THE WRONG SOLUTION FOR THIS PERCY PROBLEM ASK FOR NO VOTE. WELL I'M SORRY. THE MAN CLIP WE HAVE ANY TIME LEFT FOR THE OPPOSITION OKAY PLEASE. MY OPPOSITION IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY STATED JENNIFER WHAT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS. ALSO HERE OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED WE DO FEEL WITH THE AMOUNT OF AID TO WAYS IN CALIFORNIA THAT THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS PROBLEMATIC. ESPECIALLY IN THIS INSTANCE WHERE THERE ARE VOLUNTEER THESE ARE VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE GIVING THEIR TIME -- AND IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE SCOPE OF AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE FOR THE HOMEOWNERS IN THAT COMMUNITY FOR EACH ASSOCIATION TO BE ABLE. TO CUSTOMIZE WHATEVER -- ELECTION PROCEDURES ARE NECESSARY TO SUIT THE HOMEOWNERSHIP WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY SO FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED. WE OPPOSE THE BILL. OKAY -- EIGHTY WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THE IS THE BILL. MY KNEES ARE SHOT A STEPHANO I I AM FULLY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] SUPPORT [inaudible] MY LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE LET ME JUST START BY FIRST CLEAR FIND THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE CHAIR AND I HAD AGREED TO I KNOW THERE WERE TWO MINUTES THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU WILL BE TAKING THE FIRST AMENDMENT AROUND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS WHICH I THINK IS A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT TO REGAIN INSURE -- BOTH CLARITY BUT BUT BUT MAKING SURE THAT CANDIDATES -- ARE APPROPRIATELY FOLLOWING UP WHAT WE NEED TO SEE DONE IN THIS OP WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE WE WILL CONTINUE. TO WORK ON I'M NOT GOING TO ASK OR INSIST ON NOT BEING TAKEN FOR THIS COMMITTEE -- WE CAN OBVIOUSLY HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IF FOLKS SO CHOOSE BUT THAT IS THE DISCUSSION THAT THE AUTHOR I HAD OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. WITH THAT IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION BY THE COMMITTEE. MR YEP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE ROOM MY MY CONCERN -- ABOUT THE BUT THE BILL IS BEFORE IS IS THAT -- I ALSO LIVE IN NAY -- IN H. AWAY AND I'VE. OF PARTICIPATED IN IN THE IN IN IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS ON IF I GUESS IF YOU WANT TO CALL THAT. AND YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO DO. I'M A WE GET OFF THAT AT THAT BOARD SOON BUT MY MY CONCERN ABOUT IT THIS BILL IS THAT. I'M OKAY WITH ALLOWING INDIVIDUAL H. AWAY THE SAID SANDERS FOR EXAMPLE. SOME H. AWAY THIS HAVE ANY REQUIREMENT AT ALL MEANING. IF YOU'RE IF YOU IF YOU'RE A HOMEOWNER. ON WHETHER YOU LIVE ON SITE OR OFFSITE. YOU CAN STILL PARTICIPATE -- SOME H. AWAY THAT I THAT I KNOW OF WOULD ALLOW OR IT WOULD WOULD GO WOULD LIMIT. ELIGIBILITY TO HOLD WATER THE ACTUALLY LIVE. IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU KNOW HE OR SHE IT'S A SIMILAR WITH THE MEDIA AND THE COMMUNITY. AND SO I'M NOT SURE IF IF -- IF WE WANT. TO PROHIBITS H. AWAY FROM THIS FROM SETTING CERTAIN STANDARDS OUR GUIDELINE ON ON HOW -- CANDIDATES OF FROM THESE THESE HOME A SHOULD BE ALLOWED OR NOT ALLOWED TO RUN ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A DIVERSE. GROUP OF OF H. AWAY HE'S A HANNAH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN ANY ANY. PROBLEMS OR WRONGDOING BUT RELEASE FORM FROM FROM ORANGE COUNTY -- I HAVEN'T SEEN A TO AB -- BECOMING A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE THE THE GAME OR THE RIG THE ELECTION IN A WAY WHERE ONLY THEIR FRIENDS OR OR ALLOWED TO RUN OR SEATED ON NEEDS A TO A BOARDS. RIGHT AT WITH REGARD TO THE ELIGIBILITY I'VE BEEN TAKING THE AMENDMENT ON ON THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS I HAD ARGUED OF BEFORE THAT YOU KNOW IF. ANY MEMBERS ON THE DAY AS DON'T PAY THEIR TAXES THAT'S AN ISSUE OF THE OF THE OF THE CANDIDACY YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING FOR THAT THE ASSEMBLY YOU JUST. HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND WHY YOU DIDN'T PAY YOUR TAXES. HI BUT I'M WITH THAT SAID I I THINK THAT OKAY IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR SPECIAL ASSESSMENT OR YOU'RE NOT IN A PAYMENT PLAN WERE YOU HAVING GAVIN YOU'RE RIGHT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO YOU KNOW OBJECTION THOSE HEARINGS. THEN YOU'RE STILL ELIGIBLE IF YOU PASS THOSE THINGS THEN I'VE AGREED TO STEP AWAY FROM FROM THAT ALGAE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. I'M IN THERE ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE YOU'RE CORRECT IN THAT SOME. H. AWAY HE'S SET DIFFERENT STANDARDS ON WHO HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN TO THE THE EQUIRE ARE THE H. AWAY. TO BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE WE'RE LOOKING HERE FOCUSING MOSTLY ON THE PROCESS OF THAT OF THE ELECTION. YOU KNOW IN IN IN THE ACTUAL TIME THAT PEOPLE CAN BE A CANDIDATE WHAT WOULD DISQUALIFY THEM -- AND AND WHO CAN GET WHO CAN GET ON THE LIST -- AND I KNOW THAT THERE WERE THE OBJECT THE OPPOSITION RAISE A LOT OF POINTS THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON THE ON AND THEIR PURVIEW WE ARE WE'RE HERE IN HOUSING. ON ON I THINK THE ASSESSMENTS IS A BIG PART OF IT THE CONCERN AND I'VE TAKEN THE STEP THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. I HOPE THAT CLARIFIES. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. LET ME -- THANK THE AUTHOR -- FOR FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD A NOTE THIS IS A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE -- BILL AND WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS AROUND -- SAFEGUARDS TO THE C. ID ELECTION PROCESS MY HOPE IS WE MIGHT BE AT THE END OF THAT. RELATIVELY SOON. BUT AGAIN APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS ON SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS AND UNLESS THERE IS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION ANY FINAL COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. I WOULD SAY AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ABOUT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND WHAT THIS BILL HOPES TO DO IS YOU KNOW I MAKE THINGS MORE DEMOCRATIC IN THE GOVERNANCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT LIVE IN A CHOICE IT'S JUST. WE MANY OF THE THINGS WE'RE ASKING FOR WOULD BE SECOND NATURE IF SOMEBODY JUST LIVED IN THE CITY AND WE'RE ASKING FOR THEIR ELECTION TO THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THEIR THEIR DECISION SO -- THESE ARE FOR THE ACTUAL -- PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THERE WITH THAT I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. AND THE ANSWER IS OUR MOTION WITH THIS. FOR IS OUR SECOND. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

SIX TO GIVE CATHOLIC WOMAN SIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THANK YOU -- FOR CONSIDERATION SB SIX MEMBERS -- TODAY I PERCENT THIS BILL WHICH WILL. IN CALIFORNIA CENTRALIZED DATABASE OF STATE AND LOCAL KNOWN SURPLUS AND VACANT. LAND AND PROPERTIES IDENTIFIED FOR CONSTRUCTION. AS WE ALL KNOW WHERE THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET. THAT'S GOING TO ADDRESS ARE STAGGERING HOUSING CRISIS THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PROPOSAL -- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OBSTACLES TO CONSTRUCTION. NOW STAKEHOLDERS HAVE IDENTIFIED LAND COSTS SPECIFICALLY. AS A BARRIER TO BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPERS OFTEN DO NOT KNOW NGUYEN SITES ARE AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP. AND WHICH ENTITIES MANAGE THE LAND -- SB -- SIX PROPOSALS TO UTILIZE INFORMATION ARE REPORTED BY CITIES. COUNTIES IN THE STATE. ANOTHER AGENCIES TO MAKE IT -- MORE READILY AVAILABLE. AND EASY TO ACCESS -- TODAY IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE PAUL GONZALEZ A REPRESENT -- RUN COMMITTEE LAND TRUSTS -- PEDRO GAL THE ALL OF NONPROFIT HOUSING. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ALTERNATE OR THE WITNESS. YOUR WITNESS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BALKANS OFFICE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE IRVINE COMMITTEE LAND TRUST. THEIR BY CHAMELEON TRUST IS A IS ONE OF TWENTY TWO INTRO THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT MAKE UP THE CALIFORNIA INTEREST NETWORK -- THE WIND TRUST MODEL PROVIDES PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE RENTAL AND HOME OWNERSHIP AND SERVE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE TAKE A PROJECT FROM CONCEPT TO CONSTRUCTION TO LEASING AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HELP FAMILIES REALIZE THE AMERICAN DREAM OF OWNING A HOME. WHAT'S THE FAMILY DECIDES TO SELL THEIR INTEREST HOME. THEY MUST SELL IT TO ANOTHER INCOME QUALIFIED FAMILY WHICH KEEPS OUR UNITS AFFORDABLE IN PERPETUITY. THE IRVINE CHAMELEON TRUST IN THE CALIFORNIA INTEREST NETWORK ARE EAGER TO GROW SERVE MORE FAMILIES SB SIX CAN HELP US IN OTHER DEVELOPERS IDENTIFY LAND READY FOR DEVELOPMENT. WE'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE MANY BARRIERS AND TRYING TO COMPLETE THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN A CENTRALIZED DATABASE OF STATE AND LOCALLY ON SURPLUS THEN VACANT LAND AND PROPERTIES VERY FOR DEVELOPMENT CAN HELP EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OBSTACLES TO BUILDING HOUSING IN THE STATE AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT. CHECK -- GOOD MORNING CHAIR -- TO RECOVER WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB SIX AND BEFORE FOR US WE SAY THAT THERE'S THREE CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING LAND MONEY AND POLITICAL WILL AND THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE LAND ISSUE. AS SENATOR BELL SAID WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH IN THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY. HOUSING OPPORTUNITY SITES IN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS AND REPORT THAT INFORMATION TO THE STATE THIS SIMPLY CREATES A CENTRALIZED DATABASE OF THAT INFORMATION AND AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS. ORGANIZATIONS THAT BUILDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS WOULD MAKE IT FAR EASIER TO IDENTIFY SITES THAT COULD BE. READY TO HELP BUILD MORE HOMES AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORTERS BONTA BROUGH CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION HERE IN SUPPORT.

YOU HAVE FOUR VOTES YOU NEED ONE MORE TO GET IT OUT APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION [inaudible] SENATOR PORTANTINO. WELCOME. YOU HAVE FILE ITEM NINE SB. FIVE THIRTY TWO YOU MAY PROCEED. WHENEVER YOU LIKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SOB PRESENTING SB FIVE THIRTY TWO I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE MINOR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS PRESENTED BY THE COMMITTEE -- THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE GLENDALE TO USE THE RAIN REMAINING BOND PROCEEDS FROM THEIR TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SUBORDINATE TAXABLE TAX ALLOCATION BOND FOR THE PURPOSE. OF INCREASING AND IMPROVING AND PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHIN THE CITY I KNOW A SIMILAR BILL BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE I WENT THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND I BELIEVE PASSED THE ASSEMBLY. FOR A SEVENTY TWO TO ZERO WHEN THE CLOSURE OF REDEVELOPMENT HAPPENED ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE REMOVAL OF FINANCING FOR A ROLE PORTABLE HOUSING -- REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THE NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL -- I DON'T KNOW IF SOME OF YOU KNOW BUT AT THE TIME I ACTUALLY OPPOSED THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AND HAVE THE BATTLE SCARS. TO PROVE IT -- GLENDALE IS TRYING TO BE A GOOD ACTOR HERE THEY HAVE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF NON HOUSING DOLLARS FROM THE CENTRAL GLENDALE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA. THAT IT IT IS PREVENTED FROM USING BY THE STATE BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT -- RATHER THAN -- CANCEL THIS BOND GLENDALE REQUESTS TO DELEGATE IT TOWARDS A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING PURPOSES THIS WOULD PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME SOLE SOURCE OF FUNDS I'M TOLD LANDALE HOPES TO LEVERAGE THIS TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH ANOTHER I BELIEVE EIGHTY MILLION AND PRODUCE CLOSE. TO FOUR HUNDRED AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP LOCAL TAX DOLLARS LOCAL FOR A LAUDABLE PURPOSE I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL. COSTS THE STATE ANYTHING AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE FOR THIS DISTRICT SPECIFIC BILL. THANK YOU BEFORE YOU PROCEED UNFORTUNATELY I'VE INSTALLED THAT I HAVE TO ADD ON ANOTHER COMMITTEE OR ALSO ABOUT TO CLOSE A ROLE BUT LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL AT THE RIGHT TIME WHEN IT IS TIME TO VOTE I'M GONNA HAVE THE GAVEL OVER TO ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES.

GOOD MORNING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND I DO WANT TO STATE THAT WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T -- OPPOSE -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE ACTUALLY CAM AND THE CREATIVITY THAT'S BEING UTILIZED TO TRY TO ADDRESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THERE WE RECENTLY TOOK AN OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS MEASURE AS WELL AS AB ELEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE AS IT'S COME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THIS COULD HAVE A LONG TERM IMPACT ON LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THOSE AREAS THAT RELY ON PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. HE COULD EITHER HINDER THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD GO TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE RELYING IN THOSE AREAS OR COULD HAVE A LONG TERM IMPACT IN DELAYING THE OVERALL REVENUES THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OUR CONCERN IS MAKING SURE THAT LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTICULARLY A FOR IN IN TIME OF ECONOMIC DECLINE OR WE HAVE ANOTHER RECESSION THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE DON'T WANT TO SEE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS PUT AT A COMPETITIVE AT A DISADVANTAGE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN OPPOSITION AND WE ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION.

TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN JUDICIARY PERFECT IMITATION TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR CHIU [inaudible] STATE. GABRIEL GABRIEL I GLORIA AYE GLORIA AYE KILEY. KILEY IDLY MON. LIMóN NINE MAIENSCHEIN QUIRK GOOD. FOR EFFICIENT USE OF INTERLUDE -- WHAT IS NOW A PERFECT TIME TO BRING FORTUNATE A SKIN AND PRESENTER BILL? THERE'S GONNA YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE ONE WAS SOME CONSENT SO -- YOU'LL BE PRESENTING SENATE BILL -- THREE THIRTY THREE THANK YOU ARE. CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- I WANT. TO START FIRST BY INDICATING THAT IN YOUR ANALYSIS THERE'S A LIST OF COMMITTEE MEMINTA TIME TAKING ALL OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- ADDITIONALLY I WILL BE TAKING SOME OTHER AMENDMENTS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN JUST A FEW MINUTES THE BILL NEXT GOES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I'VE MET WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHAIR AND THEIR STAFF SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE HOUSING COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT STAFF WORK TOGETHER. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL WHEN IT -- KNOCK ON WOOD GETS OUT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE IT REFLECTS -- BOTH THE COMMITMENTS I'VE ADE HERE AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN THE ANALYSIS HERE AND THE ONES I WILL BE DESCRIBING BUT BEFORE I DESCRIBE THOSE I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY. WHAT THIS BILL DOES BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF MYTHS OUT THERE? AND THIS BILL IS. HAS REALLY DESIGNED ON A VERY SIMPLE PREMISE. THAT IS IF WE WE'VE ALL ACCEPTED THAT WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS CALIFORNIA NEITHER HAS ENOUGH HOUSING. NOR. AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THOSE ARE TWO REALITIES. AND YET WHEN WE LOOK AT EACH OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY HAVE IN THEIR EXISTING GENERAL PLANS ZONING RULES ALL. THEY HAVE MORE HOUSING THAT IS BEEN ALLOWED ON ON PAPER RIGHT IN THEIR DOCUMENTS THEN AS YOU HAVE BEEN BUILT. SO. WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT IS IF WE'RE IN A CRISIS? AND WE WANT FAST ACTION. THEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET FAST ACTION IS TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THAT WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY DOING. AND JUST DO IT WITH A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENCY AND MORE CERTAINTY. SO THIS BILL IS. BASICALLY RESPECTS LOCAL ZONING. IT SAYS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR THOSE HOUSING APPLICATIONS THAT MEET YOUR EXISTING RULES. ONCE THE APPLICANT HAS PROVIDED YOU ALL THE INFORMATION YOU REQUIRE AND THE BILL. LISTS THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED THAT IS TYPICALLY CONSIDERED A COMPLETE APPLICATION. AND SO LET'S SAY I'M THE HOUSING APPLICANT AND I SUBMIT SOMETHING BUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOOKS AT IT AND SAYS YOU KNOW WE NEED A IN A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER ANALYSIS HERE WE CAN'T ANALYZE THIS. UNTIL WE HAVE -- SOME INFORMATION FROM A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER OR WE CAN ANALYZE THIS YET UNTIL IT HAS YOU KNOW THIS INFORMATION OR THAT INFORMATION SO ONCE I HAVE. GIVEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE REQUIRED ME I'M THE HOUSING APPLIQUE KIT. AND MY IN THAT THING OF THAT I AM SUBMITTING MY APPLICATION FOR MEETS. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ZONING RULES. THEN AT THAT POINT THIS IS WHAT THE BILL DOES AT THAT POINT. FEES ARE LOCKED. IN THE RULES ARE LOCKED SO THEN IT GIVES ME THE APPLICANT THE CERTAINTY. THAT. THINGS I'M NOT GOING TO BE IN THE SHIFTING LANDSCAPE SO I CAN GET THE FINANCING FOR MY PROJECT OR FIVE ALREADY SECURED IT. I CAN HAVE THE ASSURANCE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE AND WHILE CONSTRUCTION COSTS MIGHT GO UP AT LEAST THE FEES FROM THIS CITY THAT'S I'VE APPLIED TO THOSE WILL PULL UP. IN THEIR DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS WHICH I'VE ALREADY UNDERSTAND AND I'VE ALREADY MET THOSE WON'T CHANGE SO THAT'S THE SIMPLE PREMISE. AND IT WAS BASED SANTA ROSA AFTER THE COFFEE FIRE SO IN THE COFFEE FIRE THE EXPERIENCED. VERY SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF UNITS OVER A THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS WERE LOST. IN THE REALIZED THEY NEEDED TO HELP. THEIR RESIDENTS GET THOSE HOUSING UNITS BACK FAST AND EFFICIENTLY. SO THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA BASICALLY SPED UP THEIR PROCESS HE STREAMLINED THERE. THE THE PERMITTING PROCESS SO AND GAVE SOME CERTAINTY TO THE APPLICANTS TO GET THOSE UNITS BACK AND MY STAFF WATCHING THAT I ASKED MY STAFF. IT WAS MORE THAN A YEAR AGO TO CALL SANTA ROSA PLANNING DEPARTMENT. AND GET THERE I'M TO GET THE ORDINANCE IS TO GET THE MATERIALS THAT THEY DID WE BASED THIS LAW. ON WHAT SANTA ROSA DID TO RESPOND TO A CRISIS WHICH IS WHY WE CALL IT THE HOUSING CRISIS ACT. NOW THE BILL WHEN IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION IS BASED ON THE BILL WHEN IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. THE BILL HAS BEEN GREATLY MODIFIED SINCE THEN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AMENDMENTS THIS IS A LIST OF ALL THE WAYS THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED SINCE IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. SO WHILE THERE ARE OPPONENTS HERE I THINK IF THEY WERE TO READ THE BILL TODAY AND ESPECIALLY THE BILL. ONCE THE IT HAS THE AMENDMENTS THAT I'M TAKING. THE BETTER IN YOUR ANALYSIS BEFORE YOU. AND ADDITIONALLY. I AM SO NO LET ME BACK UP SO MY PURPOSE WAS TO GIVE THAT CERTAINTY TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING. AND WHEN WE COMES TO AFFORDABILITY A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WELL BUT IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE FACT IS THAT. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VERY FREQUENTLY FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH THE IN LIEU FEES AND OTHER FEES IMPACT FEES THAT THEY GET FROM THE MARKET RATE HOUSING. THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO MORE MARKET RATE HOUSING THAN THEY WOULD ALREADY HAVE SAID YES. TO BUT IT ALLOWS THEM TO DO IT A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND THEN THEY GET THAT REVENUE TO HELP THEM DO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND ADDITIONALLY OF COURSE IN THE BUDGET WE JUST APPROVED WE JUST GAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY TOWARDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT LET ME GO FURTHER. I'M SOMEONE WHO KNEW MY HISTORY. IT WILL REVEAL TOO MUCH ABOUT MY AGE BUT I WAS INVOLVED IN THE WRITING OF BERKELEY'S RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES IN THE SEVENTIES. I WAS INVOLVED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND THE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BERKELEY RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES. I HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT AND LONG HISTORY WITH RENT CONTROL I AM ONE OF THE FEW. LEGISLATORS WHO SUPPORTED PROP. TEN WHICH I REALIZE IS AN ANATHEMA TO MANY PEOPLE. AND I STILL SUPPORT RENT CONTROL AND I STILL WANT THERE TO BE EVICTION PROTECTIONS AND OTHER PROTECTIONS FOR OUR TENANTS OF EVERY SORT. BUT RENT CONTROL IS NOT ENOUGH MY OWN COMMUNITY BERKELEY HAS HAD RENT CONTROL AS I JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU SINCE THAT TIME NO CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF STATE LAWS THAT HAVE. INHIBITED SOME OF THE INTENTIONS OF BERKELEY'S ORIGINAL RENT CONTROL BUT RENT CONTROL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE SUPPLY CRISIS SO WHILE WE MUST PROTECT LOW INCOME TENANTS AND I AM A VERY STRONG ADVOCATE FOR PROTECTING LOW INCOME TENANTS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL YOU'LL SEE. THAT THIS BILL CONTAINS PROTECTIONS FOR LOW INCOME TO TENANTS SO THAT IF THERE'S ANY PROPOSAL TO DEMOLISH AND AFFORDABLE UNITS. THAT OCCURSDURING THE FIVE YEARS THAT THIS BILL IS IN EFFECT IN THIS BILL ONLY HAS. PROVISIONS FOR FIVE YEARS IT SUNSETS IN FIVE YEARS BUT THOSE TENET PROTECTIONS ARE THAT IF FOR ANY REASON A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WERE TO APPROVE A DEMOLITION AND I'M NOT ADVOCATING THAT THEY EVER DO. BUT IF THEY WERE TO THEN AND IT WAS A LOW INCOME UNITS. THEN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE GUARANTEED TO REPLACE AT LEAST THAT MANY LOW INCOME UNITS THE TENANTS IMPACTED WOULD HAVE TO BE RELOCATED. AND THEIR RELOCATION EXPENSES PAID. FOR AND THE A GUARANTEE THAT THEY HAVE OUR FIRST RIGHT ON THE UNITS THAT REPLACE AT THE SAME RENT SO THERE IS STRONG STRONG PROTECTIONS. FOR LOW INCOME TENANTS IN THIS BILL. BUT AGAIN WHAT IS THIS BILL TRYING TO DO IT'S TRYING TO HELP US. GET THE HOUSING THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALREADY APPROVED BUT TO DO IT EFFECTIVELY. AND EFFICIENTLY TO RESPOND TO THIS HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE ARE IN NOW I MENTIONED THAT I WILL TAKE ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS. I AM ALSO COMMITTED TO FULLY DELETING THE SECTIONS ON PARKING. NOW. THAT ONE JUST FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY DID I PUT THAT IN THE BILL AND LET ME AND WHEN I SAY HI. THIS BILL IS MY BILL THIS IS A BILL THAT MY STAFF AND I CRAFTED YES WE HAVE SUPPORTERS YES WE HAVE SPONSORS BUT WE CRAFTED THIS BILL AND WE CRAFTED IT BASED ON SANTA ROSA'S ACTION. BUT THE REASON THAT WE INCLUDED THE PARKING PORTION IS BECAUSE PARKING ADDS COST. AND WHILE MANY PEOPLE SAY THIS DOES NOTHING FOR AFFORDABILITY MY PURPOSE IS TO TRY TO EVEN BRING DOWN THE COST OF MARKET RATE. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T CONTROL THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. THAT IS SOMEWHAT OUT OF MY CONTROL BUT AT LEAST BY REMOVING THOSE COSTLY ELEMENTS THAT DO COULD WE DO HAVE CONTROL OVER AND THOSE COSTLY ELEMENTS ARE THINGS LIKE TIME AND UNCERTAINTY. BUT ALSO PARKING THAT WAS MY MOTIVATION IT WAS TO REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT OF PARKING IT WAS NOT TO PREVENT PARKING IF THE APPLICANT FELT THAT THEY NEEDED PARKING THIS BILL WOULD NOT OF PROHIBITED. BUT BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION HAS TURNED THAT INTO SECTION. YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO KILL THE BASIC OTHER ESSENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS BILL I'M WILLING TO GET RID OF IT. SO I AM GONNA FULLY DELETE THE REFERENCES TO THE PARKING. SO THAT SECTION FIVE BE ONE THAT WILL BE DONE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. AND I'M GOING TO ALSO FULLY ELIMINATE. THE PART THAT'S AROUND THAT WOULD HAVE RESTRICTED CHEST FOR THE FIVE YEARS. ANY VOTER -- REQUIREMENTS ON APPROVING. A CITIES. SO WE HAVE SOME COMMUNITIES WHERE IF THE CITY ACTS. TO PROVE CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT THEN HAS TO GO BEFORE THE VOTERS WHICH OF COURSE GREAT LEAD DELAYS THE PROJECT. AND ADD SIGNIFICANT COST BUT BECAUSE THE BILL IS ONLY IN EFFECT FOR FIVE YEARS AND IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT IN A FIVE YEAR PROCESS YOU WOULD HAVE. A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTING AND THEN THE ABILITY FOR THE VOTERS TO ACT IT'S JUST BETTER TO GET RID OF IT BECAUSE IT REMOVES THAN THIS THING THAT SOME OPPOSITION SEEMS TO HAVE LATCHED ON TO AS THE POISON PILL OF THE BILL. SO FINE WE'LL GET RID OF IT WE HAVE STILL PRESERVED THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO RESPECT EXISTING ZONING BUT GIVE THE APPLICANT CERTAINTY. AND GIVE THEM A TIME LINE WHICH EXISTING LAW UNDER THE PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT ALLOWS. FOR SO THAT'S IN EFFECT WITH THE BILL DOES APOLOGIES FOR GIVING A BENEFITTED BY DOING SO. AND I WOULD NOW ALLOW MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO SPEAK. THANK YOU SENATOR TO YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING CARE TO PRODUCT ALTHOUGH WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT ONE CRITICAL THING WE'RE HERE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF SB THREE THIRTY BECAUSE WHILE IT IS NOT A BILL THAT'S EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL HAVE MANY BENEFITS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS LIKE ANY DEVELOPMENT STILL MUST PAY -- IMPACT FEES AND STILL FACE THE LACK OF CERTAINTY OVER ISSUES THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES LIKE. CERTAIN LIKE FEES ZONING AND EVEN HISTORIC STATUS. AND SO -- WITH THAT WITHOUT CERTAINTY THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FASTER. THAT IS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED BY BAY AREA RESIDENTS AND BY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STATEWIDE -- TO GIVE YOU AN AN IDEA RIGHT NOW IT TAKES A PROJECT ANYWHERE BETWEEN FROM FOUR TO TEN YEARS TO GO FROM CONCEPT TO REALITY. IF THIS BILL CAN SHORTEN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME EVEN BY A COUPLE OF MONTHS OR IDEALLY A COUPLE OF YEARS. THAT WOULD MEAN THAT HOMES CAN GET. THAT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS CAN GET A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD FASTER AND THAT WE CAN GET ALL THE BENEFITS THAT COME WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUCH AS THE BETTER EDUCATIONAL HEALTH. AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES SOONER -- FOR OUR STATE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT SB THREE THIRTY AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD MORNING HOW THERE'S THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN CHIU MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION. AT UC BERKELEY WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING PARTICULARLY TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT. WE ARE IN THE DPTHS OF A DEEP AND WORSENING HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE OVER HALF OF OUR RENTER'S PAYING MORE -- THAN -- 30% OF THEIR THEIR INCOME ON RENT AND OF THOSE WE HAVE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION PAYING MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT AND SO. ON TOP OF THAT'S WE ARE EXPERIENCING OUR LOWEST LEVELS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTY SO IT'S CLEAR THAT THE SCALE OF THIS CHALLENGE DEMANDS SOLUTIONS -- THAT MATCH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM AND THERE ARE FEW PROPOSALS -- LEFT ON THE TABLE THIS SESSION THAT ARE AS IMPORTANT AS SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY SO WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS BILL FOR TWO SPECIFIC REASONS THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY OUR RESEARCH IN THE FIRST IS THAT. THIS BILL LARGELY PROHIBITS CITIES FROM ENACTING A DOWN ZONING TO MORATORIUM'S THAT WOULD LIMIT THE LIMIT THE CAPACITY OF NEW HOUSING AND AS OUR WORK HAS SHOWN THROUGH OUR CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU SURVEY. MOST CITIES ARE DOING THEIR PARTS TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO NEW CONSTRUCTION BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE STILL SOME PLACES THAT ARE USING LAND USE POLICIES IN A RESTRICTIVE MANNER. TO MAKE IT. MORE DIFFICULT TO BUILD NEW HOMES IN MANY TIMES THESE PLACES ARE -- AREAS THAT THE STATE HAS DEEMED HI OPPORTUNITY AND THAT WE ARE WE WOULD LIKE TO PRIORITIZE THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THESE LOCATIONS. AND SO THE SECOND REASON WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS BILL IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE COST AND TIME THAT IT TAKES TO DELIVER HOUSING CALIFORNIA WE HAVE WORK FORCE COMING NEXT MONTH. ON THE COST TO BUILD A DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALIFORNIA AND OUR RESEARCH IS SHOWING THAT THINGS LIKE PARKING THINGS LIKE -- INCREASING FEES UNCERTAIN TIME LINES THESE ARE AT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF COSTS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEW RESOURCES THANKS TO LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT COSTS KEEP RISING. THOSE NEW RESOURCES WILL NOT BE AS EFFICIENT AND AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY COULD BE AND SO THIS BILL BY LOCKING IN WHAT COULD BE CHARGING FEES AND SIMPLY ASKING CITIES. TO BE A BIT MORE EXPEDITIOUS WITH THE APPROVAL PROCESS THE PROCESS IS ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE THIS KIND OF A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY. TO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY DELIVER -- HOMES PARTICULARLY AFFORDABLE HOMES SO -- I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT WHEN I THINK SENATOR FOR WORK ON THIS THINK COMMITTEE AS WELL AND I LOOK FOR TO THE DISCUSSION. OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRPERSON MISTER SURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CORNELIS BURKE WITH THE BEAR COUNCIL IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. JENNIFER SPECTRUM HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS ALSO IN SUPPORT.

LOUIS MANTE WITH CALIFORNIAN BE IN STRONG SUPPORT. REGGAE'S WITH UP FOR GROWTH ACTION IN STRONG SUPPORT. ANY GEORGIA IS WHAT AGAIN BEFORE THE OPPOSITION IT WE ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS% STEADILY SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE NEW AMENDMENTS WE'VE MOVED TO NEUTRAL. AND LOOK FORWARD TO REASSESS IT OUR POSITION AFTER WE SEE THEM BUT THE REST THE MEMBERS THANK YOU. ME ASK IF THERE IS ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE YES HELLO THANK YOU I AM. MY NAME IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME IN. CO DIRECTOR WITH THE SAN DIEGO TENANTS UNION. I WE REPRESENT AND ORGANIZE TENANTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THREE THIRTY WEEK WE BELIEVE THIS IS A DISPLACEMENT BILL. WE BELIEVE IN A CITY LIKE SAN DIEGO THAT'S PRO DEVELOPER -- THIS DOES VERY LITTLE TO PROTECT TENANTS THIS ACTUALLY. MAKES THE HOUSING CRISIS WORSE BY. POURING FOR MORE GASOLINE ON THE FIRE. THE SPOT ZONING IS A REAL PROBLEM I DON'T ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU COMBINE IT WITH. THE FACT THAT THERE'S AN ENCOURAGING OF DEVELOPERS. HAVING THE ABILITY TO SUE. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IF THEY DON'T APPROVE THEIR PROJECT. WE BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA STRAIN I OUR RESOURCES AT THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE THINK THIS IS PART OF A PATTERN. OF POLICY MAKING THAT'S SUPPORTIVE OF DEVELOPERS AND IS NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT IT. THESE ARE IN FACT -- BILLS LIKE SB FIFTY THAT ARE DISPLACING COMMUNITIES -- THESE ARE ACCELERATING THE DISPLACEMENT OF COMMUNITIES AND EXCELLING ACCELERATING GENTRIFICATION. WHAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEN IT HAPPEN -- ANIME ON A MASS SCALE WE'RE SEEING. RENT INCREASES AND ABUSES BY A OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT. THAT IS GOING ON CHECK -- BECAUSE IN CITIES LIKE SAN DIEGO WITH THEIR NO RENTAL. LIEUTENANT PROTECTIONS VERY LIMITED TEN PROTECTIONS -- WE NEED MORE PROTECTIONS BEFORE WE NEED MORE DISPLACEMENT. AND THESE BILLS ARE TAKING THE WRONG APPROACH THEY'RE MAKING IT SO THAT THERE IS MORE DISPLACEMENT. AT FASTER RATES [inaudible] WITH. NO PROTECTIONS ON RENT CONTROL NO PROTECTIONS ON TEN AND JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE ACTIONS THERE'S NO PROTECTIONS ON YOU KNOW WHAT WE TALK ABOUT RELOCATION BUT IN SAN DIEGO THERE'S NO RIGHT RELOCATION ASSISTANCE. SO. YOU KNOW THE COSTS ARE GETTING OUT OF HAND THE RENTS ARE ALREADY BEYOND REACH AND THIS IS EXACERBATING A PROBLEM THAT -- WILL SOON. TURN INTO A A MUCH. THIS COULD BE A CATASTROPHE NOT ONLY A CRISIS IS COULD BE A CATASTROPHE. AND BILLS LIKE THIS ARE LEADING THAT. CHARGE AGAINST A COMMUNITY. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHEN WE'RE TAKING THE APPROACH IN SOLVING THE HOUSING CRISIS WE DON'T? YOU KNOW. GIVE EVERYTHING TO THE VALOUR BRIDGE WHO HAVE INTENTIONALLY SURPRISE BUILDING. I'D JUST SO THAT THEY CAN GET THESE TYPES OF PERKS AND START CONSTRUCTING AT DIFFERENT THINGS IN DIFFERENT PLACES THAT WERE NOT COMMON IN SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE -- POINT TO GENTRIFICATION AND SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE RECOGNIZED AS A CONTRIBUTING CSU DISPLACEMENT. SO WE STRONGLY URGE OPPOSITION. IF -- MEMBERS SAY THAT THEY ARE -- SUPPORTING THINGS LIKE RENT CONTROL. WE WANT TO SEE UNIVERSAL RENT CONTROL WE WANT TO SEE A REPEAL OF COSTA HAWKINS. WE WANT TO SEE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THESE TYPES OF DISPLACEMNT BILLS THAT SHOW. LIKE IN PLACES LIKE SAN DIEGO THAT THINGS ARE. BEING GRANTED TO DEVELOPERS AT THERE WILL. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE NOT FOR DEVELOPERS. HI MY NAME IS AJMAL JONES -- I MAY SHE WAS SOUTH SOUTH BOSSES SAUSAGES SALT LOS ANGELES -- NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL -- I LIKE TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR ALL -- PUTTING EFFORTS AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS -- CRISIS THAT IS AGAIN STATEWIDE AND WE'RE EXPERIENCING IT. IN LOS ANGELES AS WELL -- FEW WEEKS AGO -- WE HAD A MEETING ON SOUTH LOS ANGELES -- REGARDING A PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT MAY POSSIBLY -- GIVE MORE UP HARD TO DEVELOPERS IN THE PLANNING. OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT WAS A REALLY STRONG POINT OF CONTENTION. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT OVER A DECADE -- COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS AND FOLKS -- HELP DEVELOP A COMMUNITY PLAN IT MADE SENSE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND AND THIS -- THIS POSSIBILITY THERE'S A THERE'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THE PACKAGE BE WIPED AWAY. AND AGAIN BACK. TO THE EVENT I MEAN WE PLANTED IN A WEEK A PRINTER FIFTY PEOPLE CAME OUT SO IT'S IT'S A REALLY STRONG POINT OF CONTENTION -- ONE OF MY OTHER CONCERNS IN REGARD TO THIS BILL IS THE ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY -- JUST IN OUR COMMUNITY -- THERE'S THERE IS THERE IS HOUSING BEING BUILT I MEAN YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME AND WE WERE WEIRD LOS ANGELES IS MOVING FOR WITH THAT -- I'M I'VE GOT A QUESTION THAT BUT THE ISSUE IS AFFORDABILITY -- YOU JUST TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS AND IS OKAY THERE'S A NEW BUILDING COMING OUT BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. SO HOUSING IS THERE SO IT'S JUST. BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT SO THAT'S JUST THE BIG AGAIN A BIG POINT OF CONTENTION WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY -- I KNOW THE CITY AGAIN HAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. BUT AGAIN GOING BACK TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THAT'S JUST A BIG ISSUE -- BOB THE RISK I WAS TALKING AGAIN I WAS TALKING TO OUR OVER DRIVERS RIDES I USE AS AN EXAMPLE AND YOU SEE THIS IN A CITY IN MY COMMUNITY WE GOT NEIGHBORS ARE JUST -- RING AND FINDING WAYS TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND IT'S JUST THEY NEED THIS HOUSING AND THEIR THEIR MEMBERS ARE COULD OF OUR COMMUNITY BUT THEN YOU'RE BEING FORCED TO MOVE OUT TO OTHER AREAS. BUT THIS CHANGE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE BEING FOR THIRTY YEARS AND MY COMMUNITY IT JUST HAPPENED AND PRICES ARE GOING UP AND MILLION DOLLAR HOUSES AND PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN. FOR AGAIN THIRTY YEARS. AND YOU KNOW WHO'S DOING ANYTHING TO HELP THAT AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE WANT TO SEE WE WANT TO PUSH. YOU KNOW WE WANT DEVELOPMENT BUT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE -- CONTROL AND PLANNING AN INPUT ON THAT DEVELOPMENT. ON ESPECIALLY IT'S ADDRESSING THE ACTUAL NEEDS OF FOLKS AT LIVING COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES. AND NOT THE NEEDS OF FOLKS THAT. CAN COME IN AND YOU KNOW -- WEB JOBS AND JOBS BEING BUILT IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT COMMUNITY MEMBERS I HAVE A WORKING AT THESE JOBS. AND THE BUILDING HOUSING ALONG RAIL LINES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WORKING AT THESE NEW BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY DON'T WORK AT SO I MEAN THIS IS JUST. AGAIN IT'S A PERVASIVE ISSUE -- THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE ADDRESSING -- THERE IS AGAIN A STRONG CONCERN REGARDS OR SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS THAT'S COMING OUT AS WELL. SO -- BUT AGAIN THE MAIN ISSUE I COULD SAY THAT I'M HEARING RESONATING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY WOULD BE AFFORDABILITY WHICH I DON'T REALLY SEE. A STRONGLY ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL -- BUT AGAIN WE DO APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORTS BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG CONVERSATION INPUT FROM EVERYONE -- TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION -- BUT AGAIN IT'S LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER OPPONENTS TO THE BILL IF THERE ARE IF YOU WANT TO PLEASE STEP UP AND STATE YOUR NAME. AND YOUR AFFILIATION AND SIMPLY THE FACT OF YOUR OPPOSITION -- DANNY HUGO CONCERNED CITIZEN LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE THIRTY THANK YOU NEXT BECOME.

MY NAME IS JOSEPH MY NAME IS JOSEPH FOR REVIEW AND I'M IN A COMMUNITY ACTIVIST Và SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON AND I ON IN A POSITION OF SB -- THREE THIRTY BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THERE'S A CLEAR DISCONNECT BETWEEN ON THE BILL ON THE CONSTITUENTS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THANK YOU. MY NAME IS STANLEY CHAT MEN I'M A RESIDENT OF LOS ANGELES AND I'M OPPOSED SB THREE THIRTY BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR THE PROPOSAL THE BILL SAY THAT IF THAT THAT'S IN FIVE YEARS IT MAKES ME THINK OF A BILL THAT WAS PASSED. IN WASHINGTON NOT TOO LONG AGO WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GREAT DEAL THAT WAS GOING TO GIVE LOWER TAXES THE PEOPLE BUT THE PORTION THAT HELP THE PEOPLE SUNSETS IN FIVE YEARS. SO THE OFFENSE THAT IN FIVE YEARS MAKES ME THINK THAT IF IT'S SO GREAT WHY IS THIS SOMETHING WITH BOTH THE CURE -- HOMELESSNESS IN THE PORT TAKE CARE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHY DO SOMETHING A FIVE YEARS BECAUSE IT AND NOT ONLY DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU AGAIN IF I COULD ASK MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AT THIS TIME A PUBLIC COMMENT TO SIMPLY STATE YOUR NAME WHAT ORGANIZATION WITH AND THE FACT THAT YOU POSSIBLE.

THIS FEATURE MEMBERS JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES WE HAVE OPPOSE A POSITION AS BILL BUT WE DO GREATLY APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL OF THE PARKING LANGUAGE -- I THINK THAT'S A VERY POSITIVE STEP WE DO HAVE A COUPLE TWO THREE REMAINING CONCERNS THEY WERE HOPING I'M TO GET A DRESSED ONE IS THE FREEZING OF OUR FEES AT A TIME IN WHICH WE DON'T KNOW THE TOTALITY OF THE PROJECT. WHICH MEANS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHARGE PROJECT SPECIFIC FEES THOSE ARE THE FEES THAT ONLY APPLIED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL PROJECT BASED ON ITS -- IMPACTS IN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT'S BEEN FROZEN OUT AND THEN ALSO -- THE BILL WOULD ALLOW THE DEVELOPER TO PULL THAT -- GET THEIR APPROVAL AND NOT HAVE TO CONSTRUCT THAT YOU'D THOSE UNITS FOR THREE YEARS. HE'S FOR THREE YEARS. WHEN I BELIEVE NOW THERE DOESN'T THAT'S GONNA GO TO HALF YEARS -- BUT NONE THE LESS TWO AND A HALF YEARS I WITHOUT ADDRESSING THOSE FEES IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS A CITY NOT HAVE AN INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE -- BUT DURING YOUR TWO OR TWO AND A HALF WE WANT TO HAVE ONE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO APPLY THAT TO THE DEVELOPER IF WE'RE IN A CRISIS AND WE LIKE TO SEE DEVELOPERS BUILD THE THE ABILITY TO RAISE FEES DURING THAT PERIOD MIGHT SPUR THEM TO CONSTRUCT AND NOT JUST ON THAT PERMIT THANK YOU.

DAVID KING TONYA WITH THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IN STRONG OPPOSITION. CURRENT LETS ME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DISCUSSION MISTER GORE. HE WAS CHAIRMAN -- IN THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER FOR THE PRESENTATION EXPLANATIONS AS WELL AS THE AMENDMENTS AND MONEY TO A LOT OF THAT -- NEVER THE OPPONENTS OF MAKE COMMENTS I THINK ARE WORTH A RESPONSE -- I STRUGGLED WITH UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THEM SO PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME THAT MEANT IT WAS MENTIONED BY SEVERAL SPEAKERS THAT THIS BILL IS A SPOT ZONING BILL. I'M I DON'T SEE REFERENCE TO THAT IN THE LEGISLATION CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO WHAT THEY MIGHT BE REFERRING. TO OR RESPOND TO WHAT THEY REFERENCED I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE REFERRING TO BUT IT IT'S NOT A SPOT ZONING BILL IT DEFINITELY. I MEAN MAYBE THEY THINK THAT BECAUSE AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO TRADE TESTIFY WERE THEIR WHAT THEIR LOGIC IS BUT AS I INDICATED AND AND AS I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION I THINK THAT. WANT SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN -- WERE INTRODUCED IN THE SESSION NO LONGER EXIST. THE THE SAME ARGUMENTS THEN GOT APPLIED TO THIS BILL WITHOUT REALLY LOOKING AT ITS CONTENT THIS BILL DOES NOT. INCREASE DENSITY IT DOES NOT. CHANGE THE ZONING POLICIES OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND IT TREATS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MARKET HOUSING THE SAME SO. WE ALREADY HEARD FROM OUR SPINE. SORRY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THAT. I IN I DON'T HAVE THE DATA STATEWIDE BUT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IN MY DISTRICT IN OAKLAND AND BERKELEY. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS SUBMIT. APPLICATIONS AND IT TAKES. MINIMUM FIVE YEARS AND UP TO TEN YEARS BEFORE THEY GET A PERMIT AND BY THE TIME THEY GET THEIR PERMIT FOR A 100% AFFORDABLE PROJECT. THERE FINANCING IS COMPLETELY OUT OF DATE. AND THEY HAVE TO START OVER. SO THIS BENEFITS BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS SAY WHATEVER IS IN YOUR EXISTING ZONING RULES ONCE THE APPLICANT HAVE SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION. AND YOU THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE I'M GONNA USE THE WERE DEEMED COMPLETE THERE'S A LEGAL DEFINITION FOR THAT SO I DON'T MEAN THE LEGAL DEFINITION I MEAN. AS IT DESCRIBES IN THE BILL THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT EVERYTHING THEY'VE REQUESTED AN EVERYTHING THAT'S DESCRIBED IN THE BILL. THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO ANALYZE THE PERMIT. AND AT THAT POINT OF COURSE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN. GIVE YOU A PROJECT SPECIFIC FEET IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR APPLYING THE PROJECT SPECIFIC FEET THEY JUST HAVE TO APPLY ITAT THAT POINT. BUT THEN FROM THAT POINT ON AS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS ANALYZING IT. IT LOCKS BEING SENT SO MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK IS PROJECT SPECIFIC SOMEBODY I DON'T KNOW BUT IT JUST LOCKS IT NOW IT DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO PROVE YOUR PERMIT. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD DENY IT AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT PREVENTS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM DENYING IT OTHER THAN ANY EXISTING. LEGISLATION FOR EXAMPLE EXISTING STATUTE LIKE THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SO AGAIN I'M NOT SURE WELL AS POSSIBLE SURE IF YOU WANTED. QUESTIONS BUT YEAH I THINK I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPOT ZONING IT'S ALREADY LARGELY. AVAILABLE IN IN DIFFERENT CITIES AND COMMUNITIES AND AND COUNTIES. WHAT WHAT THIS BILL IS IS IS FACILITATING? DEVELOPERS TO COME IN AND AND TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF IT AND SAY WELL IF YOU DON'T GET THIS LUXURY COMPLEX HERE IN THIS SPECIFIC PLACE THEN I'M GOING TO SUE YOU. AND AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT WENT WHEN YOU'RE REDUCING THE TIME FRAMES YOUR XCELERATED SOME OF THESE THINGS -- ACCELERATING TO A POINT WHERE THEY MIGHT BE OVERSIGHT WHERE THEY MIGHT BE -- COMPELLED TO NOT REVIEW IN THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE REVIEWING -- EACH PROPOSAL. AND SO THESE ARE THESE ARE REAL ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT CREATING THEM IMMEDIATELY BUT YOU'RE FACILITATING. THAT THAT SITUATION AND AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SAYING THIS IS THE SPOT ZONING BILL BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW THE THE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE EXPLOITING THAT. IT INCREASES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY. SO TECHNICALLY THE BILL DOES NOT TWO SPOTS ONLY WHAT THE ARGUMENT IS IS IF. A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALREADY HAS SPOT SOUND BUT OF COURSE THIS IS TRYING TO RESPECT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXISTING ZONING. SHE WAS ABOUT TO STE IS FOR A DEFINITION THE QUESTION BIG CELEBRATION AT BECAUSE SPOT ZONING WOULD BE. WHAT I WAS ACTUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WITH REGARD TO THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS IS TAKING SPECIFIC AREAS NAY OF IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL WITH A QUARTER MILE OF CERTAIN FORMS OF TRANSIT? IN CHANGING THE KINDS OF ENTITLEMENTS THERE UNDER THAT PROVISION. WILL USUALLY IT WILL BE DELETED YES I'M SO THAT WAS THE CLOSEST I CAN GET AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR THOSE WAS TO SERVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO DICTATE THE FORM. OF OF THE OF THE DEVELOP AN ENVELOPE THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THIS WHAT THIS BILL SPEAKS TO IS TIMING AND COST. WHICH I UNDERSTAND THE POINT ABOUT THAT FACILITATING. DEVELOPMENT BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE OTHER OBJECTIONS THAT WERE RAISES THE ISSUE AROUND FOR ABILITY HE SAID IT ALREADY BUT I THINK IT BEARS REPEATING. THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED ONLY -- TO FOR MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT THIS THE BILL APPLIES TO ALL DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING SUBSIDIZED DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE SUPPORT LISTS THAT IS IN THE ANALYSIS OF MANY OF THE MAJOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOUSING FOR THE FORMALLY HOMELESS -- FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES FOR SENIOR CITIZENS FOR OTHER AFFECTED COMMUNITIES IS THAT CORRECT YES ON IT AS YOU SAY THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE HELPFUL TO THOSE THAT WANT TO SEE MORE LOW INCOME HOUSING -- IN MORE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OFTEN MARKET DEVELOPERS PAY THE KINDS OF FEES THAT HAVE BEEN A HALLMARK OF THIS CONVERSATION MOST OF THIS MORNING. THE GOING TO HOUSING TRUST FUNDS LIKE WHAT WE HAD IN SAN DIEGO WHICH COULD IN TWO THINGS ONE BILL MORE UNITS BUT THEN ALSO MAKE THEM HOPEFULLY MORE DEEPLY SUBSIDIZE SO YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. 80% A 100% 120% BUT MORE LIKE 30% OR 50% A AM I WHICH FRANKLY IS WHAT HARD WORKING PEOPLE EARN IN MANY PARTS OF OF SAN DIEGO. WHO CAN'T STILL FIND A PLACE TO LIVE I DON'T WANT OTHER ISSUE THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS RUN HISTORIC RESOURCES THE SYSTEM MEAN IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME? THIS BILL WOULD IN NO WAY -- ELIMINATE OR MODIFY LOCAL A HISTORIC RESOURCES LEGISLATION ORDINANCES. IT DOES NOT SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU ARE CORRECT IT DOES NOT. IMPACT IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALREADY HAS HISTORIC PRESERVATION ORDINANCE FOR EXAMPLE. OR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS OR IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN OF OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES IF THEY HAVE COASTAL HEIGHT LIMITS. THIS BILL DOES NOT OVERTURN KNOWS OR INTERFERE WITH THOSE AND IN FACT WE EVEN PUT IN AN EXPLICIT AMENDMENT. THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS FEAR IN THERE WAS CAN THERE WAS A LOT OF MYTHS OUT THERE THAT THIS WOULD. OVERTURN COASTAL HEIGHT LIMITS AND SO WE PUT THAT LANGUAGE WE DID IT WE DIDN'T NEED TO MAKE THE LANGUAGE EXPLICIT BECAUSE IT ALREADY DIDN'T DO THAT BUT CHEST. BECAUSE PERCEPTION SO OFTEN. UNFORTUNATELY RULES THE DAY WE PUT EXPLICIT LANGUAGE IN. SO I APPRECIATE CLEAR FIND THAT -- IT'S A DATE WITH A FORTY FIVE YEAR REVIEW FOR STRUCTURES THAT ARE OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD THEY MUST GO TO A STORE RESOURCES BOARD FOR CONSIDERATION. IF TEAM TO STORE IT THAT OFTEN -- IMPACTS THE WAY THAT THE PROPERTY MAY BE USED GOING FORWARD YOUR BILL WOULD NOT CHANGE CORRECT -- SO LASTLY I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE AMENDMENTS YOU ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN THE ANALYSIS YOU MADE MENTION OF TOUCH. I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- INSIDE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE INCLUSIVE OF REMOVING THE SECTION ABOUT SUBSTANDARD HOUSING YEAH WITH REGARD -- TO CODE COMPLIANCE YES -- BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I COULD NOT HAVE SUPPORTED -- ANY SORT OF ALLOWING OF SLOW MORE SIXTEEN OPERATE -- I THINK THE PROCESS IS FAR TOO SUBJECTIVE ALREADY ACTING FRANKLY THAT'S HOW IT KIND OF WORKS BUT EXPLICITLY STATING THAT FROM THE STATE WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING I COULD SUPPORT. THAT WAS A SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENT THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE ACCEPTING SO THAT'S DONE THE REMAINING TWO THINGS WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR FOR HEARING OUT THE CONCERNS. THAT I VOICE ON BEHALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS -- YOU MENTION THE PARKING REQUIREMENT YOU'RE REMOVING THAT PARTICULAR SECTION CAN YOU STATE ON THE RECORD WHAT SECTION THAT IS THAT YOU INTEND YES. WE WILL BE DELETING [inaudible] IT IS [inaudible] BE. ONE AND THE ONE IS ALL THE REFERENCE TO THE LIFTING OF PARKING MINIMUMS AND THE AT THAT THERE WOULD. ONLY BE ALLOWED A POINT FIVE PARKING SPOT AND FORGET ALL THE LANGUAGE ANYWAY IT WOULD BE DELETED. AND SO IN A COMMUNITY LIKE MINE IN SAN DIEGO IN THE CITY SAN DIEGO WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A PARKING MINIMUMS. BY DOING THAT THE LOCAL RULE STILL APPLIES SO WHAT -- IS APPLICABLE IN SOLANA BEACH WHICH I'M GONNA REPRESENTING WOULD REMAIN WHAT HAPPENS ANY CITY SAN DIEGO WOULD REMAIN THE BILL WOULD NO LONGER TOUCH THAT YES ANY. CITY AFFECTED OR COMMUNITY AFFECTED BY THE BILL. THAT HAS A REQUIRED MARKING PARKING MINIMUM EVEN IF THAT REQUIRED PARKING MINIMUM IS A QUARTER MILE FROM MERRILL STOP WHICH IS ALL THE BILL HAD IN THERE BUT WHATEVER EVEN IF IT HAD THAT. WITH THE DELETION OF THAT SECTION. IN ALL. COMMUNITIES EXISTING PARKING MINIMUMS WOULD REMAIN THE SAME. AND AS I MENTIONED MY INTENT FOR TRYING TO LIFT PARKING MINIMUMS WASN'T TO PROHIBIT PARKING IF THE APPLICANT IN THE CITY WANTED TO INCLUDE PARKING I'VE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. IT WAS TO HELP REDUCE COSTS OF MARKET RATE BECAUSE PARKING GREATLY THREE INCREASES THE COST. BUT BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION AND BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO AS THEY SAY THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER IN LOSE THE OTHER VERY ESSENTIALLY IMPORTANT PARTS OF THIS BILL. I'M WILLING TO DELETE IT AND WE WILL BE. TAKEN OUT AMENDMENT AND DELETING THAT SECTION THANK YOU SIR ONE LAST QUESTION SENATOR OF MISTER CHAIRMAN. SO WITH REGARD TO VOTER ENACTED MEASURES YES ARE YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT YOU'LL BE REMOVING. ANY SECTIONS OUT REGARD TO THAT SO ON THE BILL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO DOWN ZONE IF THEY HAVE THAT PROVISION ALREADY THERE ARE SOME. AREAS WHERE EITHER BY. BY COUNSEL ENACTMENT OR BY VOTER ENACTMENT. THAT -- CERTAIN LAND USE CHANGES OR CERTAIN TYPES OF PROJECTS MUST GO BEFORE VOTER APPROVAL. AND THE BILL ORIGINALLY. SB THREE THIRTY WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN TO TAKE EFFECT FOR TEN YEARS AND BECAUSE WE'RE IN A CRISIS IT WAS. YOU KNOW TRYING TO HELP FACILITATE. DEALING WITH OUR OF OUR HOUSING IN THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD. AND YOU KNOW JUST FOR A LIMITED TIME SUSPENDING SOME THINGS. BUT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE REACTION TO THE SUSPENSION OF A VOTER APPROVAL AND BECAUSE NOW THE BILL IS ONLY IN EFFECT FOR FIVE YEARS. AND OF COURSE AS WE KNOW THE PERIOD OF TIME IT TAKES TO GET SOMETHING ON A BIT FOR FIRST A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ACT AND SECONDARILY SOMETHING TO GET ON THE BALLOT. THE LIKELIHOOD OF VOTER APPROVAL EVEN BEING RELEVANT IN THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD IS LOW SO IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO TO JUST. TO LEAD THAT AND I WILL BE TAKING THAT AMENDMENT THAT WOULD TO LEAD SECTION F.. ONE WHICH AGAIN SUSPENSE THE VOTER APPROVAL OFFICIAL THAT WOULD BE GONE APPRECIATING SPECIFICALLY JUST TO DRAW A LITTLE BIT DEEPER BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN SAN DIEGO WE HAVE EXTREME INTEREST IN COSTA HEIGHT LIMITS YES -- AND YOU HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CLEAR ON THE SENATE SIDE ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL WOULD AND WOULD NOT DO THERE CONTINUES TO BE A PERCEPTION THAT THIS BILL WHILE IT WOULD PROHIBIT -- WHAT WOULD NOT REMOVE THE COSTA HAD LIMITED VOTERS ENACTED MANY YEARS AGO RIGHT BUT IT THE BILL TO THE MINUTE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IT ALSO PRECLUDE THE CITY COUNCIL BY A MAJORITY VOTE? FOR OVERTURNING THE THE CITIZENS EFFORTS WITH REGARD TO COST ISLAND THE ONLY REASON. SO LET ME I AM NOT HEDGING ON THAT AT ALL IT'S JUST THAT EVERY CITY HAT AND EVERY. SO SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE VOTER INITIATIVES THAT RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING SOME DO NOT RIGHT SO IF I HAPPEN TO BE IN A CITY WHERE THERE'S NO VOTER RESTRICTION. ON WHAT MY CITY CAN DO BY MAJORITY VOTE THIS BILL DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH ANY OF THE EXISTING RULES. IF THE CITY. HAS ALREADY. VOTER INITIATIVE THAT DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO CHANGE SOMETHING MY MAJORITY VOTE THAT IS PRESERVED IN RETAINED THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THAT. BUT IF COURSE IF THERE IS ANOTHER CITY THAT CAN CHANGE SOMETHING BY MAJORITY VOTE BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH WHATTHE CITY CAN DO. THEY MAY BE ABLE TO DO THAT I UNDERSTAND THE NUANCE OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IF THE VOTERS APPROVED A MEASURE SAYING THEIR BABY MAY BE NO HEIGHT. THOUGH CONSTRUCTION BE ON A THIRTY FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT. NO EXCEPTIONS THIS BILL WILL NOT CHANGED CORRECT ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THANK YOU I WANT TO JUST WIND UP BY SAYING. THAT I APPRECIATE THE MISCONCEPTIONS WITH THE BILL OBVIOUSLY WE DEALT WITH SOME PRETTY HEAVY LEGISLATION IN THIS SESSION I DO THINK BASED ON SOME THE INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH CONSTITUENTS IN OTHERS. THIS BILL IS OFTEN CONFLATED ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS DOES IS IT GIVES A TIME LINE FOR ANY APPLICANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT IF YOU WILL. THIS BILL IN NO WAY MANDATES THAT LOCAL DECISION MAKERS MUST OF A PERMIT A PARTICULAR PROJECT THEY MAY IS PERMITTED AS MUCH AS THEY MAY DENY IT. AROUND THE DIFFERENCE IS A CERTAINTY OF TIMING AND WRITING T. OF COST YEAH I THINK THOSE TWO THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE RULES DO NOT CHANGE DURING THE PROCESS OF THE APPLICATION BEING ANALYZED I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT VERTICALLY AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER WORKING IN. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS A FORMER HOUSING COMMISSIONER I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE APPLICATION PROCESS SEES WE'RE DEVELOPERS ARE SEEKING TO BUILD HOUSING FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES MUST APPLY THEY SOMETIMES ARE ANNUAL OR SEMI ANNUAL. IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU MISS SEPTIC AROUND THE FUNDING AND YOU MUST WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE BUT IN THE MEANTIME FEES IN A CONSTRUCTION COST OF CHANGE THAT MAY MAKE A PROJECT THAT STUFF'S GOING TO GET SOME AWARD. BE IN FEASIBLE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THERE'S FEWER HOMES AT PRICES THAT PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY AFFORD I THINK THAT THIS BROUGHT THIS BILL AND DID EXTENT THAT'LL HELP FACILITATE -- BUT PROCESS FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROJECTS TO PROCEED I THINK IS BRILLIANT I'M I'M NOT SO ESPECIALLY CONCERNED WITH MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE GUESS WHAT THE BANKS WILL STILL BE THERE THEY DON'T HAVE FUNDING MOUNT THEY DON'T HAVE DEADLINES. THEY WILL ALWAYS BE THERE AND CERTAINLY WITH MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT PEOPLE ALWAYS FIND A WAY RIGHT BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE PROVIDING HERE IS THIS IN T. OF PROCESS THAT FRANKLY SHOULD BE THERE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE IN A HOUSING CRISIS. PEOPLE DESERVE A STRAIGHT ANSWER ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO COST AND HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE THAT IS TRUE FOR MISTER WOULD SENATOR WHITE HOUSE USE A MOMENT AGO DOING ADDITION TO HIS HOUSE. TO SOMEBODY'S GONNA MASTER PLAN DEVELOPMENT OVER SOMEBODY'S DOING AN INFILL DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL GET HOMELESS PEOPLE OFFER STREET. I THINK THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE IF THIS IS ENACTED HOW IT WORKS BUT I SUSPECT THAT WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE WHAT SOMETHING'S GONNA COST AND HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE. IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT MORE HOMES WILL GET BILL AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PRIORITY LIST IN TERMS OF WHO CAN ACTUALLY SUCCESSFULLY PENCIL PROJECT. IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND BY GOD WE SHOULD HELP THEM SO -- I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS I KNOW YOU'RE TAKING THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOME A STATE VERY CLEARLY RIGHT NOW IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR SOME ODD REASON YOUR WOMAN OF YOUR WORD BUT I KNOW IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. YOU KNOW I WILL NOT SUPPORT THE BILL AND I'M HAPPY IS FOR THE BILL TODAY. AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ASKING FOR THESE CLARIFICATION SO THAT. IT'S ON THE RECORD EXACTLY WHAT THE BILL DOES A REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I THINK AS WE KNOW. VERY COMMONLY IS LEGISLATORS WE ARE APPROACHED BY WAY ANY ENTITY WHETHER IT'S LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUSINESS WHOEVER ADVOCATES WHO SAY WE CHEST ONE CERTAINTY WE JUST WANT. WEEK WE DON'T MIND IF THE STATE YOU KNOW ENACT SOMETHING WE JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ALSO. TO HAVE THE RULES CHANGED WHEN WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO DO AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR CLARIFICATIONS [inaudible] MR MENTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS AT FIRST IT FOR ME -- GOING BACK EVEN IN MY CITY COUNCIL DAYS. THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THAT I HAVE INCLUDES ESSENTIALLY THAT THE CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT I REPRESENTED -- WHEN I WAS A SENIOR CITY COUNCIL MEMBER I'M FORTUNATE THAT THE PLANNING GROUPS IN THAT COMMUNITY GROUPS AND IN MY DISTRICT HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD -- THEY HAVE BEEN REASONABLE THEY HAVE. NOT THROWN UP ARTIFICIAL -- SORT OF COMPLAINTS THEY'VE JUST BEEN THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE AND AND AND BY AND LARGE ME MAYBE NOT IN EVERY INSTANCE BUT OVERALL CERTAINLY -- VERY PLEASED TO WORK WITH THEM -- DURING MY TIME AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL FOUND THEIR COM. AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO TO DEVELOP A SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF MY DISTRICT FOUND THEIR COMMENTS TO BE HELPFUL IN THE WORK THEY DID TO BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL WE HAVE A GOOD COMMUNITY IN NO SMALL PART BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY GROUPS -- THAT I'M FORTUNATE TO REPRESENT. WHEN THIS BILL CAME OUT? MY COMMUNITY GROUPS AND THE CHAIRS -- WERE. PRETTY UNITED VERY UNITED LEE OPPOSED TO IT -- AND IT WAS JUST. CAN ONLY KIND OF UNUSUAL BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TIME THEY DON'T REALLY. A PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION OR MAYBE EVEN CARE AS MUCH WHAT GOES ON IN SACRAMENTO BUT ON THIS. ONE THEY WERE VERY UNITED -- SO I HAD AT I WHAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THAT OPPOSITION DISCUSSING THEIR COMPLAINTS. I WANT TO REALLY CREDIT -- YOU SENATOR SKINNER FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THIS BOTH YOU KNOW AFTER APPRECIATIVE OF OUR INTERACTIONS BUT SECONDLY JUST THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THE AMENDMENTS -- AND THE WORK YOU'VE DONE IS YOU'VE MOVED THROUGH THIS THIS PROCESS I WILL SAY THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SENEGAL BROUGHT UP -- A CERTAINTY OF PROCESS THAT DOESN'T EXIST. IN LARGE PARTS OF THE STATE -- AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT LOCALITIES ARE GONNA NEED TO WORK ON IN ALL THIS AS MUCH AS THE STATE GOOD BAD OR INDIFFERENT SOMETIMES WEIGHS IN ON THIS. A LOT OF THESE ISSUES IN WE TALK ABOUT IN ADDITION. YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL HAD THE HORROR STORIES OF SOMEBODY TRYING TO HAVE IN ADDITION TO THEIR HOME OR DO SOMETHING HOME IT TAKES HIM. TWO YEARS AND COMFORT STATION IN MY DISTRICT TOOK FOUR YEARS I MEAN IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY ABSURD AND TO LOOK AT THEN POINT FOR LOCALITIES AND TO POINT THE FINGER AT SACRAMENTO I THINK ON SOME OF THESE THINGS IS. A LITLE BIT DISINGENUOUS -- SO FOR ME TODAY I I'M ACTUALLY GONNA LAUGH THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I NEED TO TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS BACK THESE MEMBERS MOST OF THEM I BELIEVE HAPPENED THIS MORNING I HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TO MEET WITH MY PLAYING GROUPS AND AND HAVE THEM TAKE A LOOK AT THESE IT MAY REMOVE. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE SO THE IT'S HIGHLY POSSIBLE MAY REMOVE THE OPPOSITION OF THE COMMUNITY GROUPS BUT I DID WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT. THESE WERE FROM WHERE I SIT I WASN'T I WISH I WAS UNFORTUNATE I DON'T REPRESENT A LOT OF AND READ IT AND REASONABLE MESS AROUND REASONABLE -- GROUPS WHO JUST SORT OF CAN I COME UP WITH COMPLAINTS IN ORDER TO BE OBSTRUCTIVE THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL AND THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING THEM. GIVING WHAT THEY SAY A LOT OF CREDENCE BUT I WILL. TO TO YOU -- I WILL SAY -- I WILL MEET WITH HIM AGAIN I WILL I WILL MAKE SURE THEY GET ALL OF THIS INFORMATION SO THEY CAN LOOK AT THIS AND REVIEW THIS AND THESE PLANNING GROUPS CAN THEN WAY AND AGAIN AS THIS. MOVES FOR BUT I WANTED TO EXPLAIN TO MEMBER AND TELL YOU THAT I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU. DESERVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CREDIT. I'LL MAKE A FEW COMMENTS AT THIS POINT FOR SO I WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR COURAGE. IN MOVING FORWARD SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT IDEAS -- AND I WILL ALSO SAY FROM MY OBSERVATION OF HOW THIS BILL HAS BEEN PORTRAYED I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MIS CHARACTERIZATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL AROUND POTENTIALLY -- SAYING THIS IS A SPOT SONY BILLS BEEN REPEATED BEFORE THAT SOMEHOW TURBOCHARGING PRODUCTION THAT IT SOMEHOW -- FAVORING ONE TYPE FOR ASKING THIS YEAR'S A QUESTIONS AND I THINK REALLY DO HELP TO ELUCIDATE THAT THIS IS NOT. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS A BILL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT DURING THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY CITIES ARE NOT BACKTRACKING THAT CITIES ARE DOING WHAT THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DO -- AND PROVIDING PREDICTABILITY AND FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY AND CERTAINTY TO THAT PROCESS I AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEEP ENGAGEMENT I KNOW WITH EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE INCLUDING MY STAFF AND MY OFFICE. AS WELL AS WITH THE PUBLIC -- AND FRANKLIN TAKING SOME AMENDMENTS THAT -- I WAS HOPING YOU WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE -- BUT I APPRECIATE THIS IS A POLITICAL PROCESS AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. TO THE OPPOSITION. I WANT TO SAY YOU HAVE MANY ALLIES HERE -- I AM AN ALLY OF YOURS I KNOW THAT THE SENATOR AUTHOR IS AN ALLY AS WELL AS SOMEONE WHO IS AUTHORED A TENET BILL EVERY YEAR I HAVE BEEN HERE -- AS SOMEONE WHO IS AUTHORED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNNY MEASURES AND I THINK ANYONE LSE IN THIS HOUSE -- WE AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE FOR TENANTS WE HAVE TO DO MORE AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- BUT I THINK SOMEHOW THE NOTION OF NOT HOLDING CITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IF WE DON'T DO THAT THAT IS GOING TO EXACERBATE THE PLATE. FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY IT WILL LEAD TO FURTHER GENTRIFICATION AND THIS IS WHY -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD -- I DO APPRECIATE AND I SUSPECT THEY'LL BE MANY MORE CONVERSATIONS AS WE DO THIS BUT MY HOPE IS. THAT WE CAN BRING TOGETHER THE OPPOSITION AND THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL WE NEED ALL THE ABOVE SOLUTIONS WE NEED MORE TEN A PROTECTIONS WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING. WE HAVE TO DO THAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIES THAT HAVE LAID OUT RULES TO BUILD HOUSING OR ACTUALLY GONNA DO THAT AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DOWN ZONE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CREATE MORE TORRANCE AND BUILDING HOUSING THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO DURING THIS CRISIS SO -- CENTERS THANK YOU -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO PRESENT A FEW BILLS IN OTHER COMMITTEES AT THIS POINT SO NATURALLY HE FOR THE DIRECT VOTE BUT I DO INTEND TO VOTE FOR AT THE RIGHT TIME. AND WITH THAT I THINK THERE WERE A FEW OTHER HANDS MISS EMMA. THANK YOU -- AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AT THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN VERY ENGAGING -- IN HELPING US ALL ONE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BILL DOES AND DOES NOT DO BUT ALSO LISTENING TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT COME FROM VERY DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THINK -- YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS THE CENTER BECAUSE I SOMETIMES THINK THAT SOME OF THE APPROACHES THAT COME LEAVE US. OUT OF THE EQUATION AND THINKING ABOUT IT BUT YOU HAVE -- AND AND I WANT TO CLARIFY TWO DIFFERENT POINTS I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO -- WENT THROUGH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I SHARED AS WELL BUT THERE'S TWO OTHER CONCERNS THAT A PRODUCT THAT I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN RESPOND TO ONE IS THERE -- A IN OPPOSITION COMMENT THERE WAS SOME CONCERN THAT THIS COULD CONFLICT WITH THE COASTAL ACT AND I JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE -- AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS COULD CONFLICT WITH THE COSTA ACT WHICH IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT IN OUR STATE. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT WOULD CONFLICT WITH THE COASTAL ACT AND IN FACT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE FOR ME TO PUT ANYTHING IN THE BILL. TO CONFLICT WITH THE COASTAL ACT WOULD REQUIRE IT WOULD HAVE TO BILL KEYED AS A TWO THIRDS VOTE BECAUSE THE COASTAL ACTORS OBVIOUSLY VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVE. SO THAT THAT JUST HELPS YOU KNOW NEED TO TAKE MY WORD ALONE BUT THAT AS IT IS NOT KEY TO TWO THIRDS VOTE IT HAS NOTHING IN IT THAT IN ANY WAY INTERFERES WITH ANY -- STATEWIDE VOTER INITIATIVES THANK YOU AND THE SECOND PIECE IS A AS A DISTRICT THAT'S BEEN IMPACTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS -- A BAY AND ALSO THAT'S AYE HAS HOUSING -- IN THE COASTAL AREA WE SEE EROSION AND CLIFFS -- CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE IN THIS BILL -- FOR SOME OF THESE AREAS -- I KNOW ONE OF THE CONCERNS EYEBROWS LIKE WILD THE TOPOGRAPHY HAS CHANGED -- IN SOME OF THESE AREAS AND THEY CAN'T REPLACE -- THE STOCK IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA BUT CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THIS AND HOW THIS MITIGATES SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS -- FOR COMMUNITIES CERTAINLY SO. JUST LET'S USE FIRE FOR A MOMENT AS AN EXAMPLE SO WE HEAR NOW VERY MUCH DISCUSSION AROUND THE WE WE WHICH IS THAT URBAN. WILDLAND INTERFACE WHICH IS WHERE SOME OF OUR FIRES START. AND THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT. ARE THE VERY FACT THAT MANY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALLOWED FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE WE WE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE OUR SEVERITY OF FIRES OR AT LEAST THE LOSS OF HOUSING DUE TO FIRES. SO NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS -- MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RESPONSE TO A FIRE IN IT WHO WE WE áREA HAVE NOT CHOSEN TO CHANGE THE ZONING OF THAT AREA THEY HAVE PRIMARILY ALLOWED. FOR THE REBUILDING **** I WAS ON THEIR BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL DURING THE OAKLAND BERKELEY TUNNEL FIRE WHICH PRIOR TO THE COFFEE FIRE IN THE PARADISE WAS V.. HI WORST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY IN TERMS OF LOSS OF UNITS -- BUT WE DID NOT DENOUNCE OWN IT WHATSOEVER AND ALLOWED. FOR THE JURISDICTION THAT YOU KNOW TO TO REBUILD NOW THERE IS SOME I SAY ALL THAT BECAUSE SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE THINKING ABOUT WHETHER THEY WOULD MODIFY. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO ADD MORE PROTECTIONS THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM DOING SO. AND THE ONLY THING IN THIS BILLS IT RESTATES EXISTING STATUTE WHICH IS THE NO NET LOSS. IN THE NO NET LOSS OWNING SAYS IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES THEIR ZONING. IF THEY YOU KNOW REDUCE THE DENSITY WHERE THEY'VE ALREADY ALLOWED A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT THEY WOULD JUST HAVE. TO REPLACE IT ELSEWHERE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. SO WOULD NOT PREVENT THEM FROM EITHER LIMITING COASTAL FOR FOR EROSION PURPOSES LIMITING COASTAL DEVELOPMENT OR LIMITING WILL BE DEVELOPMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME STILL KEEP IN PLACE THAT WE'RE NOT LOSING GROUND IN STOCK AND YES AREAS THAT ARE HARD TO FIND PERFECT -- I I APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU'VE WORKED AT THIS AGAIN I THINK COLLEAGUES HAVE SHARED THIS -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY -- AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT EASY THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED I JUST IN MY THREE YEARS HERE -- A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN A HOUSING BILLS ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AND NONE OF THEM ARE THE PERFECT. ANSWER TO ANY OF THIS A THING TO THOSE -- IN OPPOSITION IS PARTICULAR TRADE TENANT GROUPS WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT TO DO BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF BILLS WE HAVE SHOWS THAT THERE'S NOT ONE BILL THAT SOLVES AT ALL -- AND SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH SO QUIRK SILVA. I WON'T BE REDUNDANT BUT SAY THAT AGAIN JUST THIS YEAR BEING ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE WE'VE SEEN SOME SERIOUS LEGISLATION AND WE HAVE -- MOVE FORWARD MANY BOLD PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT SOME AGREE WITH AND SOME DON'T. BUT THE INTENT HERE IS TO FOCUS ON THE CURRENT SITUATION WHICH IS. NOT ONLY A HOUSING CRISIS BUT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DYING ON OUR STREETS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ORANGE COUNTY WE'VE HAD JUST FIFTEEN NEW DEATHS IN THE MONTH OF MAY. WHICH TAKES US WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED DEATHS SINCE LAST YEAR. WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THERE IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WHEN IT COMES TO ZONING WHEN IT COMES TO PLANNING -- BUT UNLESS WE START TO USE MULTIPLE APPROACHES AND GET OUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES OUR LOCAL ELECTED LEADERS. TO DO MORE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SAME OUTCOMES -- SO AS THIS WAS NOTED IT DOES SOME THINGS BUT IT DOESN'T DO A LOT OF THINGS -- BUT EVERY UP PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS -- AND TO GET PEOPLE HOUSE ARE YOU CENTRAL -- SO I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL I WILL TELL YOU I HAVE SEVERAL BILLS -- AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA NOTED -- WE HAVE TO TRY MANY THINGS SOME OF THEM. MAY NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS OTHERS BUT WE CANNOT BE AT THIS TIME REDUCING REDUCING ANY TYPE OF HOUSING AND WE ALL TO OFTEN HAVE SEEN. UP PLANS TABLED UP LOCAL A CITY COUNCILS PLANS REJECTED BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT THEM IN THEIR NEIGHBOR HOOD OR AND SO FORTH SO AGAIN THIS IS A STEP IN -- KEEPING THINGS CERTAIN AND MOVING FORWARD SO I DO SUPPORT IT [inaudible] THE GABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND I JUST WANNA ALSO -- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER APPROACH AND FOR ALL OF FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE AMENDMENTS A LOT OF THOSE AMENDMENTS REPORT TO ME IT'S I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I WANT. TO THANK UP MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO ASKED A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD AND CLARIFIED A LOT OF THOSE THINGS WHICH REPORT TO ME SO I'M NOT GONNA. RETRIED BACKGROUND I DO -- WANT TO SAY THAT -- IT AND I THINK YOU SUGGEST AS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL REALLY DIES AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE OBJECTIONS TO THIS BILL IN THE LANGUAGE THAT I'VE SEEN IN IN OPPOSITION LETTERS. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEIR CONFLATING DIFFERENT BILLS AND I'LL JUST SAY IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THESE ARGUMENTS ABOUT AGAINST SB FIFTY AND THIS BILL IS NOT SB. FIFTY THEY ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT BELLS THEIR DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND REALLY WHEN I SUCH OFF MY STAFF WE WENT THROUGH THE ARGUMENTS AND APPLY THEM TO THE TAX INCLUDING YOU KNOW THE TEXAS IT WILL BE READ WITH YOUR MINUTES THEY JUST THEY JUST DON'T ADD UP -- AND THEY'RE NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I THINK THE APPROACH OF THIS BILL IS AND WHAT THE WHAT WITH THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE SIZE SO. I'D REALLY ENCOURAGE A LOT OF THE FOLKS ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL TO GO BACK AND READ THE TEXT OF THE BILL TO LOOK AT WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES BECAUSE IT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT SOME OF THE ARGUMENT THAT FOLKS ARE MAKING. I REPRESENT A VERY SUBURBAN DISTRICT I'M UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT THE FACT THAT I LIVE IN THE BURBS I LIKE THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR MY KIDS. AND THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS IS GONNA SOMEHOW DESTROY THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY -- I THINK IT'S OUTRAGEOUS IT'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT AND I ACTUALLY THINK. I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN APARTMENT -- I DESCRIBE IT IS RELATIVELY MODEST IN COMMONSENSE I THINK WE'RE JUST ASKING FOLKS TO PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY AND TIMING AND COST TO WHAT THE RULES OF THE ROAD WILL BE. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING AS AS OUR CULTURE SAN DIEGO SAID THE FUNCTION EXPECT FROM GOVERNMENT AND WE'RE NOT REQUIRING FOLKS TOPS OWN. THEIR TO DO ANY OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS SIMPLY -- ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO HELP US CONSISTENT SEVERAL SO FOLKS CAN HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING ABOUT. AND YOU KNOW I ALSO WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY THE BACKDROP OF THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE. FOLKS ARE DYING ON THE STREETS WE SAW THE NUMBERS FROM THE MOST RECENT HOMES COUNT IN THE CITY OF LA AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR CITIES. AND SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE KNOW THAT THE PRODUCTION PIECE. AND PARTICULARLY THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE HAVE THE MOST. SIGNIFICANT ADVOCATES HERE YOU KNOW TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A KEY PART TO SOLVING THIS CRISIS IS PRODUCING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS ARE GONNA BE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I AM GOING TO RESERVE MY RIGHT ON THE FLOOR IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT SOME OF THESE AMENDMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SUGGESTED -- ARE ARE TAKEN BUT I I YOU KNOW I KNOW THE YOU TO BE A PERSON OF OF YOUR WORD AND I KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW AS THIS BILL MOVES FOR HOPEFULLY IT'S GOING TO GET TO THE PLACE IN IN FINAL STATUTORY LANGUAGE WHERE. RIGHT TO VOTE FOR ON THE FLOOR BUT I DO REALLY WANT TO COMMEND YOU. I THINK THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE APPROACH WE NEED TO BE TAKING -- AND I I WANT TO BE THERE TO HELP YOU EXPLAIN TO FOLKS THAT THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS BILL ARE JUST NOT ACCURATE IN THE DON'T REFLECT THE BILL AS IT IS AND WHAT IT DOES IS TO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IF THERE IS -- NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO A IS THERE A MOTION AND A SECOND. FOR FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB. THREE THREE ZERO MOVED AND SECONDED ON THE CALL -- SENATOR SKINNER A YOU YOU MAY CLOSE. THANKS SO MUCH AND YOU HAVE ON YOUR CONSENT CALENDAR ANOTHER BILL OF MINE SB EIGHTEEN AND I ONLY RAISE IT BECAUSE THAT BILL. WAS DESIGNED TO ASSIST OUR OUR TENANTS AND ADD SOME TENER PROTECTIONS IN IT WHAT ORIGINALLY CALLED. FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IN LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE -- THOSE TWO THINGS WERE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET WHICH ALL OF US JUST ADOPTED SO THERE IS NOW MONEY THAT WILL BE GIVEN TO CITIES AND COUNTIES. FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO TENANTS AND EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE SO NOW THE ONLY THING REMAINING IN THE BILL IS A CONTINUATION OF PROTECTIONS. TO TENANTS THAT WE THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED DURING THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS SO THAT IF THE TENANT IS IN A BUILDING THAT IS FOR CLOSED ON THEY HAVE MORE PROTECTIONS -- SO I BRING THAT UP ONLY. TO PUT IN THE CONTEXT OF WITH MANY PEOPLE HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ROMA WHITE DOESN'T THIS BILL SB THREE THIRTY ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER LEGISLATION THAT DOES. SO SB THREE THIRTY DOES WHAT THE GREAT DISCUSSION THAT YOU ALL HAD -- SO I WON'T REPEAT IT. AND DE THE MOTION IS WITH THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS AND I COMMIT TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT I DESCRIBED AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATEAND UNDERSTAND THAT ALL OF YOU A RESERVE YOUR RIGHT.

NEXUS OF FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB THREE TWENTY NINE BY SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL. MA'AM YOU YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE IT. CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY IMPRISONING SENATE BILL THREE TWO NINE THIS BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT LANDLORDS CANNOT REJECTED TENET. SOLELY BASED ON THEIR SOURCE OF INCOME COLLEAGUES THIS IS AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE. ACROSS OUR STATE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS RECEIVING HOUSING ASSISTANCE ARE STRUGGLING TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY DO THE BLANKET POLICIES OF LANDLORDS WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT. AT THE SAME TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO HOUSING ASSISTANCE AS A WAY OF SHIELDING TENANTS FROM HOW HIGH HOUSING COSTS IN PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS. I THOUGHT IT WAS -- IRONIC -- THE CENTER SKINNER BILL SB THREE THIRTY AS WE TALKED ABOUT AND WE HEARD MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT THAT. THE MORAL. DILEMMA WE'RE ALL FACING WITH THE HOMELESS CRISIS WE'RE ALL FACING -- THIS IS A MEASURE TO USE AN EXISTING FEDERAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO TRY TO PREVENT THE INCREASING AND GROWING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE RENT. EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND HOUSING EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE POSSESSION OF A VOUCHER. CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIAN OTHER STATES THROUGHOUT OUR NATION HAVE IMPLEMENTED SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS FOR ASSISTED FAMILIES WITH GREAT SUCCESS. BERKELEY SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO SANTA MONICA ALL HAVE SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES JUST PASSED AN ORDINANCE TO DO THE SAME. UNDER THIS BILL LANDLORDS WOULD STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCREEN VOUCHER HOLDING THE APPLICANTS USING THE SAME CRITERIA THEY USE FOR ANY OTHER POTENTIAL APPLICANTS. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY BAR THEM FROM REFUSING SOMEONE'S APPLICATION JUST BECAUSE THEY GET HELP TO PAY THE RENT. THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PUBLISHED A REPORT THAT LOOKED AT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF HOUSING FOR FAMILIES WITH SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT FOR EVERY THIRTY NINE RENTAL ADVERTISEMENTS FOR APARTMENTS THAT A FAMILY WITH THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE VOUCHER COULD AFFORD THERE WAS ONLY ONE THAT DID NOT EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT VOUCHER HOLDERS FROM AT EVEN APPLYING. YOU ALL HAVE SEEN THE I'D THE ADS TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT ONE BATH NO SECTION. EIGHT WE'RE SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS WERE NOT IN PLACE DENIAL RATES FOR ASSISTED FAMILIES WERE AS HIGH AS 75% OR MORE. IN JURISDICTIONS WITH SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS THIS DENIAL RATE WAS ALMOST CUT IN HALF. THIS SITUATION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS UNACCEPTABLE. IF WE FOUND OURSELVES FACING DATA THAT 75% OF GROCERY STORES REFUSED TO ACCEPT CAL PRESS ALSO KNOWN AS FOOD STAMPS AND PEOPLE COULD USE IT TO BUY FOOD. WE WOULD CRY FILE. I'M CRYING FILED TODAY WITH REGARD TO HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. WE SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THE SITUATION FOR THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE WE GIVE OUR STRUGGLING RESIDENCY THERE ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A PROVEN POLICY X. AVAILABLE TO CORRECT IT. THE HOUSING CRISIS IS HIT HARDEST FOR LOW INCOME RENTERS RISING RENTS LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND STAGNANT INCOMES MAKE THIS POPULATION THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO BECOMING HOMELESS. WE'VE HEARD NUMEROUS CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION -- I THINK I'LL WAIT UNTIL THEY COME AND BRING THEM FORWARD ON BEFORE I BEGIN TO CHALLENGE THEM I WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THEM. THE WITH THAT -- I HAVE WITNESSES HERE TODAY -- THAT WILL SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL FIRST OF ALL SASHA HARDEN WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND STOCKPILE WHO THAT AFFECTED RESIDENT AND WILL WALK US THROUGH HER EXPERIENCE. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. YES PLEASE YOU MAY BEGIN. MY NAME IS TASHA POWELL I AM THE LEADER OF FAIR RUNS FOR REDWOOD CITY AND A RENTER STRUGGLING TO USE MY HOUSING ASSISTANCE BEFORE IT EXPIRES. I AM HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE TWENTY NINE THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES ACT. WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT I HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR A HOUSING VOUCHER AFTER BEING ON THE WAITING LIST FOR YEARS I WAS ELATED I ATTENDED THE ORIENTATION OF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY GOOD LUCK? THE PROGRAM WOULD HELP SUBSIDIZE MY RANT FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WELL I CONTINUE TO GET A SERIES OF SURGERIES I'VE BEEN UNDERGOING THAT HAVE ME OUT OF WORK. THE FACT THAT I WOULD NO LONGER BE SPENDING 89% OF MY INCOME ON RENT. MEANT THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY FOR ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES AND PRESCRIPTIONS THAT I DESPERATELY NEED AND I HAVE BEEN HOLDING MY RECOVERY UP. BECAUSE MY CURRENT LANDLORD REFUSED TO TAKE MY HOUSING ASSISTANCE I BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR AN APARTMENT WHERE I COULD USE MY SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. ALMOST 95% OF THE ADS AND LISTINGS FOR AVAILABLE UNITS CLEARLY STATE NO HOUSING VOUCHERS WILL BE ACCEPTED. BECAUSE OF THIS I COULDN'T EVEN APPLY TO SHOW THEM THAT I HAVE GOOD CREDIT. EXCELLENT RENTAL HISTORY I'VE BEEN AT MY CURRENT LOCATION FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND HAVE NEVER MESSED AROUND PAYMENT -- PAID LATE. AND I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH THAT MY REFERENCES INCLUDE SEVERAL KEY COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. THESE REDUCTIONS OF PILED UP AND AT THIS POINT I HAVE TRIED TO APPLY TO BETWEEN NINETY AND ONE HUNDREDAPARTMENTS. OUT OF THOSE ONLY ONE PLACES ALLOWED ME TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. THE WEBSITES GIVEN TO ME BY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY FOR APARTMENTS THAT ACCEPT SECTION. EIGHT HAVEN'T EVEN HAD ONE OPENING IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS SINCE I FIRST GOT MY VOUCHER. I HAVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER FIRST TO FIND SOMEONE TO TAKE MY VOUCHER OR I WILL LOSE MY HOUSING ASSISTANCE BEFORE I'VE EVER EVEN GOTTEN A CHANCE TO USE IT. LOSING THE ASSISTANCE WILL MEAN THAT I WILL MOST LIKELY END UP HOMELESS. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF I WAS JUST GIVEN THE CHANCE TO APPLY THAT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND OWNERS WOULD SEE THAT I'M A GREAT TENANT AND I WOULD FIND AN OWNER WILLING TO TAKE MY VOUCHER. THE PROBLEM IS THAT I CAN'T EVEN GET THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAVE A HOUSING VOUCHER. THAT IS WHY SB THREE TWENTY NINE IS SO IMPORTANT AFTER WAITING YEARS FOR HOUSING ASSISTANCE I WAITED FOUR POINT FIVE YEARS FOR THIS VOUCHER. STRUGGLING RENTERS SHOULDN'T BE FORCED TO RETURN THAT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HOUSING VOUCHER RECIPIENTS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS -- I'M SUCH A HARD TIME WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB THREE TWENTY NINE WHICH IS CRITICAL TO EFFORTS TO FIX OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN THE FACE OF DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS -- ACROSS OUR STATE. THE BILL INSTITUTES A PROVEN SOLUTION BY PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION AND BLANKET BANS AGAINST APPLICANTS WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE THAT HELPS THEM MEET THEIR RENT. THE BILL APPLIES TO ALL HOUSING ASSISTANCE DISCRIMINATION BUT THE BIGGEST IMPACT IS FOR THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES ON THE FEDERAL SECTION EIGHT HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER PROGRAM. THE BILL STILL ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO SCREEN APPLICANTS FOR CREDIT HISTORY RENTAL HISTORY AND THE LIKE. BUT SIMPLY REQUIRES THESE CRITERIA TO BE PICKED A TO BE APPLIED EVENLY TO ALL APPLICANTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY RECEIVE ASSISTANCE. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AFTER WAITING YEARS IF WE JUST HEARD TO RECEIVE IT FAMILIES ARE INCREASINGLY FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO EVEN APPLY TO APARTMENTS BASED ON THESE BLANKET BANS. AND ARE FORCED TO RETURN THEIR ASSISTANCE ONIONS. HOW MUCH SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE REPORTING THAT THIS IS FRUSTRATING THEIR EFFORTS TO SPEND RAPID RE HOUSING FUNDS AND KEEP FAMILIES FROM FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS? HOUSING ASSISTANCE GIVES OUR LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES THE CHANCE TAXES NEIGHBORHOODS OF OPPORTUNITY BY SHOPPING FOR AN APARTMENT ON THE PRIVATE MARKET THE FAMILY PAYS 30% OF THEIR INCOME. AND THE HOUSING AUTHORITY PAYS THE REST DIRECTLY TO THE LANDLORD EACH MONTH. MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE INITIAL INSPECTION THAT MUST BE PERFORMED WHEN A TENANT LEASES UP WITH ABOUT HER -- AND THIS PERSON THESE INSPECTIONS ARE PERFORMED. TO CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT UNITS ARE BATES MEETING BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS -- IT MAY CAUSE A SLIGHT DELAY WHEN A TENANT FIRST APPLIES TO HOUSING -- BUT THESE INSPECTIONS ARE TYPICALLY REQUIRED TO BE DONE WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME TYPICALLY LESS THAN TWO WEEKS. AND MANY JURISDICTIONS HOUSING AUTHORITIES ARE REPORTING MUCH MUCH SHORTER TIME FRAMES -- FOR EXAMPLE SANTA BARBARA HAS REPORTED THEY PERFORM THESE INSPECTIONS TYPICALLY THE DAY THEY ARE REQUESTED. SAN DIEGO HAS DEVELOPED A PRE INSPECTION PROGRAM THAT CAN BE DONE UP TO TWO MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF ATTENDING EVEN APPLYING TO AN APARTMENT. AND THE CITY OF LA WHICH DID PASS THIS THIS POLICY YESTERDAY -- IS WORKING TO REDUCE THEIR WAIT TIMES DOWN FROM APPROXIMATELY FOUR DAYS DOWN TO TWO DAYS -- SO GIVEN THIS RELATIVELY MINIMAL BURDEN ON LANDLORDS AND THE ENORMOUS BENEFIT TO STRUGGLING FAMILIES FACING THE RISK OF HOMELESSNESS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OWN WITNESS TO TESTIFY AGAINST THIS BILL. BECAUSE OF THE RESORT -- I MEAN FOR THE FUTURE AND OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE ISLAND. WE COULD GO TO THEM FIRST IF YOU DON'T MIND SURE.

THANK YOU -- AT WITNESSES ELECTED TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. HAVE YOU COME AROUND THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF QUEEN GREASY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. HERE TODAY IN STRONG ADAMANT OPPOSITION TO SB THREE TWENTY NINE UNDER CURRENT LAW PARTICIPATION BY RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER IN SECTION EIGHT IS VOLUNTARY. UNDER SB THREE TWENTY NINE WHICH REDEFINED SOURCE OF INCOME TO INCLUDE SECTION EIGHT EVERY RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER WILL BE EFFECTIVELY FORCED TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY. UPON RECEIVING AN APPLICATION FROM AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. BECAUSE HOUSING AUTHORITIES IN MANY AREAS LACK THE RESOURCES TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS AND INSPECT PROPERTIES QUICKLY. UNITS SIT UNOCCUPIED FOR MANY WEEKS UNTIL ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS ARE MET A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS TO THE PROPERTY OWNER. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE REGARDING THIS BILLS IT IS MOVED THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. CLAIM NUMBER ONE THIS BILL DOES NOT MANDATE SECTION. EIGHT THIS CLAIM IS FALSE AMENDED THE DEFINITION OF SOURCE OF INCOME TO INCLUDE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS MEANS THE YOUR EFFECTIVELY FORCING A LANDLORD TO CONTRACT WITH LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY WHEN THEY GET A SECTION EIGHT APPLICANT. WHAT IF LANDLORD DOESN'T LIKE THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT WERE AS GREAT DIFFICULTY FILLING THEM? TOO BAD ACCORDING TO SB THREE TWENTY NINE SB THREE TWENTY NINE WOULD SEEMINGLY BE THE ONLY INSTANCE IN STATE LAW WHERE PRIVATE PROPERTY WE'RE A PRIVATE PARTY EXCUSE ME IS EFFECTIVELY FORCED ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT LESTER GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED A BILL SIMILAR TO SB THREE TWENTY NINE SPECIFICALLY GOVERNOR BROWN. VETOED SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN SB FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD HAVE AMENDED SOURCE OF INCOME TO INCLUDE SECTION EIGHT HUD VASH VOUCHERS WELL SB THREE TWENTY NINE IS FAR MORE EXPENSIVE. IN THAT WILL AMEND SOURCE OF INCOME TO INCLUDE ALL SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS. IN HIS VETO MESSAGE REST BEFORE TEAM TWENTY SEVEN GOVERNOR BROWN DOESN'T USE THE WORD DISCRIMINATION ONCE BUT HE DOES USE THE WORD MANDATE. THE GOVERNOR STATES AND I QUOTE THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR SPECIFICALLY IT FORCES LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY OWNERS TO TAKE PART IN ONE IS ALWAYS BEEN A VOLUNTARY FEDERAL PROGRAM WOULD NUMEROUS REQUIREMENTS. THESE INCLUDE REGISTRATION WITH THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY PARTICIPATION IN TRAINING PROPERTY INSPECTIONS AND MODIFICATION OF LEASES TO CONFORM WITH FEDERAL STANDARDS I DON'T BELIEVE A MANDATE I DON'T BELIEVE A MANDATE TO COMPLY WITH ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS IS WARRANTED END QUOTE. CLAIM NUMBER. TWO IF YOU RECEIVE MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS AT THE SAME TIME A LANDLORD LED THE ABILITY TO SELECT A NON SECTION EIGHT APPLICANTS. THIS CLAIM IS FALSE. WE HAVE HEARD FROM A REALTOR MEMBERS ON THIS ISSUE. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR REALTOR MEMBERS ARE PRACTITIONERS IN THE SPACE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REAL ESTATE LICENSE TO PROVIDE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES SORE MEMBERS DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES ON A DAILY BASIS. THEY HAVE TOLD US THAT IN THE RENTAL HOUSING SPACE THERE'S NO SUCH THING IS AT THE SAME TIME. MEANING IF YOU GET MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS YOU WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT THE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE SECTION EIGHT AFRICAN OR RISK FACING LITIGATION. LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THIS IS THE FIRST RENTAL HOUSING BILL THAT CA ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED IN THIS COMMITTEE THIS YEAR. SEE OUR SOUND COMMON GROUND AND IS NOW NEUTRAL ON EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY TO THE RAN CAT BILL. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE JUST BECAUSE BILL. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE ASK AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS BILL AB FIFTY THREE THE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK BILL AB SEVEN TWENTY FOR THE RENTAL REGISTRY BUILT AND NUMEROUS OTHERS. SEE ARE ALWAYS PURSUES COMMON GROUND IF THERE IS ROOM TO REACH CONSENSUS ON A BILL. HOWEVER THIS BILL SIMPLY NOT WORKABLE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM AND WILL PROVIDE INSTABILITY IN THE RENTAL HOUSING MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST OR NO VOTE ON SB THREE TWO NINE THANK YOU. THOUGHT MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RUN KINGSTON REPRESENTING THREE REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS THE APARTMENT SITUATION CALIFORNIA'S SOUTHERN CITIES. ALL SOUTHERN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY EAST BAY RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION -- ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES AND THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF ORANGE COUNTY WE TO JOIN IN OPPOSITION. I WANT TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENT POINTS THAN THE PREVIOUS WITNESS. NUMBER -- ONE THE FOCUS IN IS BEEN NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN THAT -- THERE IS UNNECESSARY DELAY AND RENTING THE RENTAL UNIT IF. IF FOR THE SENATORS COMING UP TO RANK TWO UNIT AND IS QUALIFIED WANTS TO RENT THE UNIT THE FOLLOWING DAY SHE MAY DO SO. BUT IF IT'S A SECTION EIGHT TENANT -- APPLICANT THAT'S NOT THE CASE IT DOES TAKE THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS WE'VE DOCUMENTED MULTIPLE PLACES MORE ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IF IT WAS TRUE. AS NOTED THAT IT ONLY TOOK ONE DAY TO DO THE INSPECTION AND EXECUTE THE CONTRACT THAT QUICKLY WE WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM AND IN FACT. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT SB FIVE TWENTY ONE DOES BY ANTHONY PORTANTINO HE PROVIDES A TAX CREDIT. TO BACK FILL THE FOREGOING REVENUE AS WE ARE WAITING FOR AN APPLICATION WE THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT THE SECOND POINT -- THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IF IT SAID THAT. THE INSPECTION WAS DONE THE FOLLOWING DAY THE CONTRACT WAS ENTERED INTO. THE TENET COULD IMMEDIATELY AKHET TAKE OCCUPANCY THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM THE SECOND ISSUE IS IF WE CO JOINED OR AS WE LIKE TO REFER TO IT IS DOUBLE JOINING. THE TWO MEASURES -- SO THERE'S THE TAX CREDIT NOT FILLING -- THE FOR GONE RANKED. WE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT IN THE THIRD AND FINAL POINT -- THAT WE SEE AND IN THE PROVIDING THIS TO BE A PROBLEM IS THAT NO ONE HAS SEEN WHAT THE CONTRACT LOOKS LIKE THE CONTRACT AND WE HAVE A COPY OF IT. IT'S FOUR HUNDRED PAGES LONG THAT THE LANDLORD HAS TO ENTRY INTO -- TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY THERE IS SOMETHING. THERE THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS WE DO NOT WE ARE NOT ATTACKING THE TENANT AT ALL THE APPLICANT IF YOU WILL. THIS IS. THERE IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM THAT IS -- VERY PRESIDENT THAT THE PROGRAM IS BROCADE FIX THE PROGRAM WERE HERE HAVING A TALK WITH THE SENATOR AND PROPONENTS IN AND ADDRESSING THIS INAPPROPRIATE WAY. FOR THE TIME BEING UNTIL THESE THINGS ARE SOLVED WE TO JOIN THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THE ONLY BE WITH THE A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION HERE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS WELL -- FOR FOR OUR ASSOCIATION IT'S IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE ENGAGING THE PROGRAM IS ABOUT THE PROGRAM ITSELF THE UNDER FUNDING AND UNDER STAFFING -- OF THE PROGRAM AND WE YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR OWNERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM WOULD SAY THAT SECTION EIGHT PARTICIPANTS ARE GREAT TENNIS OF ALL THE RULES. BUT WE GO BACK TO THE PROGRAM BEING UNDERFUNDED -- MOST THE TIME AND UNDERSTANDING AT THE LOCAL HOUSING -- AGENCY. FOR FOR US WE ACTUALLY WOULD. ALONG WITH A LOT OF OUR COALITION PARTNERS WILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. IF THERE WAS INTENT LANGUAGE THAT WAS -- ACCEPTED THAT WOULD CLARIFY THAT THE BILL WAS NOT A MANDATE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE FOR NOW WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] PLEASE. IF YOU COULD -- SAY YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND ASSUMING YOU'RE A POLICY THAT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE POSING. AT WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE WANT TO LIVE WITH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WE BELIEVE WE CAN COME OFF OPPOSITION IF INTENT LANGUAGE CLARIFIES THAT. THE BILL IS MANDATING THE ACCEPTANCE OF A SECTION EIGHT APPLICANT BUT DOES NOT MANDATE YOU TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE THE PROGRAM BUT WE CAN WE COULD -- GO TO NEUTRAL IF IT WAS -- ADDED THE INTENT LANGUAGE THAT WE PROVIDED THANK YOU. KATE BELLAMY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION ALSO POSE UNLESS AMENDED BECAUSE OF THE MANDATE THANK YOU. STEVE CARLSON FOR THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LOS ANGELES FOR THE REASONS STATED WE'RE MR CHEN MEMBERS PAT RAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION OPPOSE FOR SIMILAR REASONS THANK YOU. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION MISTER KILEY. I JUST SOME CLARIFICATION ON THIS -- PROPOSAL TO ADD IN TEN LANGUAGES WE HEARD FROM A FEW FOLKS THAT SO. HOW WOULD THAT WORK EXACTLY IF THE BILL WERE TO SUGGEST YOU HAVE TO TAKE SECTION EIGHT FOLKS BUT NOT MANDATE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM I THOUGHT THAT YOU THOSE TWO ONE HAND IN HAND? AND THAT THAT'S QUESTION IS DIRECTED AT ANYONE WHO. MADE THAT SUGGESTION SO ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT THE NATURE OF THEIR INTENT LANGUAGE YEAH I HEARD A FEW OF THE FOLKS IN OPPOSITION SAY THEY COME OFF IF THERE WERE SOME INTENT LANGUAGE SAYING WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE. ME HOW ABOUT I SHARE THE INTO LANGUAGE WITH YOU MAILED OUT CLEAR FIVE EXCELLENT SO FIRST OF ALL -- THE INTENT -- LANGUAGE PROVIDED -- TO NOT TO ME DIRECTLY BUT TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BY THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. A WE GOT HALFWAY THERE HALF OF IT WAS ACCEPTED IT'S IT'S A PARAGRAPH IN. PERMISSION TO READ I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE IT WITH YOU PLEASE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ENACTING THIS ACT TO PROVIDE A PARTICIPANT IN A HOUSING VOUCHER PROGRAM AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE A THOROUGH AND FAIR VETTING WHEN THEY SEEK HOUSING. THAT'S THE SINCE I ACCEPTED. NOTHING IN THIS LEGISLATION IS INTENDED TO COMPEL OR OTHERWISE REQUIRE A LANDLORD OR PROPERTY OWNER TO PROVIDE HOUSING TO ANY INDIVIDUAL NOR REQUIRE PROPERTY OWNER TO SIGN A CONTRACT COMPELLING PARTICIPATION. AND THE FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IN FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL HOUSING. SUBSIDIES PROGRAM. ECCENTRIC CETERA THAT'S THE LANGUAGE I'M NOT GONNA ACCEPT BECAUSE THE REALITY IS TWO FOLD. THE THE LANGUAGE THAT STATES. DOES NOT REQUIRE IN ORDER TO SIGN A CONTRACT COMPELLING PARTICIPATION IS BASICALLY A POISON PILL WHICH WOULD NEGATE THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE BILL. SECONDLY IT'S NOT NECESSARY ON AND I APPRECIATE WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN ATTORNEYS WE SEE THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS. BUT THE SINCE SENATE JUDICIARY ANALYSIS. PAGE EIGHT ITEM FIVE CLARIFIES THAT THIS BILL ARE ONLY PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AND THAT LANDLORDS RETAIN ALL OF THE RIGHTS. WOW THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT LANDLORDS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE TENETS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PARTICIPATION AND A HOUSING VOUCHER PROGRAM LANDLORDS REMAIN FREE TO REJECT ANY TENDENCY APPLICANTS FROM PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. PROVIDED THEY DO SO ONE OTHERWISE LAWFUL GROUNDS THAT ARE NOT BASED ON A PARTICULAR ANA PARTICIPANTS RECEIPT OF A HOUSING SUBSIDY. AND SO I BELIEVE IT IS VALIDATED BY THE ATTORNEYS IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT NOW LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL PROHIBITS A LANDLORD. FROM NOT ACCEPTING. A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T. ADVERTISE THAT YOU WON'T EVEN. ACCEPT THE APPLICATION IT DOESN'T SAY THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO RENT TO THEM. I I THINK I AGREE WITH THAT THE THE SENATOR I IN AS MUCH AS THAT IN TEN LANGUAGES TO REJECT WITH ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE ANY. BY YOU KNOW EFFECTIVE THE BILL IS IN MY DO YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT ANYONE IN OPPOSITION THAT THERE'D STILL BE THE BILL STILL SERVE SOME PURPOSE OF THAT INTENT LANGUAGE IS THERE. BUT THE US BEING FOR FOR CA ARE THE INTENT LANGUAGE -- WE AGREE TO THE CENTER THE THE INTENT LANGUAGE THAT'S BEING OFFERED IS IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE TO THE CODIFIED PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. SO IS SO IT WOULD IT WOULD IT WOULD -- DO NOTHING IN OUR ESTIMATION. HEY YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A LOT OF WHERE -- THE OPPOSITION COMES FROM THE WHAT I WOULD OBJECT TO IS THE FORCED PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM THAT ADDS A WHOLE LOT OF NEW -- REQUIREMENTS SOME OF WHICH ARE APPARENTLY QUITE INTERESTS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY I'D IMAGINE THAT A LOT OF THE JURISDICTIONS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND A LOT OF HUMOR IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I I ALREADY HAVE VERY HIGH STANDARDS FOR THESE SORT OF THINGS FOR INSPECTIONS AND SO FORTH SO. HI. YOU KNOW ARE THE REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICIPATION THE PROGRAM ARE REDUNDANT OR IS THERE ANY AVAILABILITY UNDER FEDERAL LAW -- TO WORK WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THEY ALREADY HAVE HIGH STANDARDS TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THOSE REDUNDANCIES. SO THE THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE INSPECTIONS THE INSPECTION IS SOMETHING ADDITIONAL THAT'S REQUIRED BUT THE STANDARDS THAT ARE INSPECTED FOR ARE THE BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS THAT ARE ALREADY REQUIRED OF LANDLORDS. TO MAINTAIN THEIR APARTMENTS WHETHER OR NOT THEY ACCEPT HOUSING ASSISTANCE -- TENANTS AREEVEN ABLE TO MOVE IN AND OUT WHILE LANDLORDS ARE REMEDYING. PROBLEMS THAT COME UP IN THE INSPECTION SO LONG AS THEY'RE NOT AND AN ABSOLUTE LIFE THREATENING CONDITION -- AND THEN LANDLORDS DO ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET SORT OF BACK PAY -- FOR THE TIME IN BETWEEN -- IN TERMS OF THE CONTRACT THAT'S BEEN TALKED A LOT ABOUT AND THOSE OBLIGATIONS ESSENTIALLY WHAT LANDLORDS AGREED TO WHEN THEY SIGNED THAT CONTRACT IS. TO RESPECT THE TENANTS RIGHTS FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE PROGRAM -- MAINTAIN THEIR UNITS AT THEIR THEIR BASIC OBLIGATIONS OF LANDLORDS CURRENTLY -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FOUR HUNDRED PAGES THAT'S REFERRED TO WAS ABOUT THAT MAY BE THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT IF YOU APPLY ALL THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THIS PROGRAM. BUT IT'S A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD AGREEMENT SAYING WE WILL TAKE YOUR PAYMENTS WE WILL YOU KNOW COMMUNICATE WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY WE AGREE TO RESPECT TENANTS RIGHTS AND MAINTAIN OUR UNITS. HOW [inaudible] MR GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF AND AS A METAPHOR I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THIS BILL AND I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION. I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER IF YOU SAW CRAIGSLIST AD FOR DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT NO PEOPLE OF COLOR MAY APPLY. THE NO VETERANS MAY APPLY. THE POOR FOLKS SHOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY WE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT IN THIS STATE AND YET IT IS REGULAR THAT YOU SEE THIS NO SECTION EIGHT MAY APPLY. MONEY IS MONEY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IT COMES FROM AS LONG AS THEY PAY THEIR BUT NO ONE IS BEING ASKED TO TAKE A HAIR CUT NO ONE HAS ASKED TO BE TAKING A FREE MONTHS RIGHT THAT IS NOT WAS OCCURRING. WHAT IS SIMPLY BEING ASKED THE PEOPLE DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S PARTICIPATION A PROGRAM THAT IS MEANT TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM HOMELESSNESS -- THAT MAN I'M JUST WRITING CATCHY NAME WHEN YOU GET A TEST I MEAN FOR BUT I DON'T IS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT WOULD NOT MEANT TO THIS YOUNG LADY -- SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE SAME APARTMENT. AND YET YOU CAN YOUR CURRENT WHAT PROPERTY OWNER WILL NOT ACCEPT SECTION EIGHT AND YOU HAVE YOUR I'D ALMOST AHUNDRED PEOPLE YOU'VE ARE COMPLEX YOU APPLY. TO THIS ILLUSTRATES THE POINT OF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF MS MET IN THE SENATOR WAS ASKING YOU TO RENT TO SOMEONE THAT WAS A DISASTER OF A TENANT -- THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY DIFFERENT BUT THIS SIMPLY SAYS THAT YOU CANNOT ADVERTISE TO SAY THAT YOU CAN'T DO THAT BUT YOU DON'T SPECIFICALLY DISCRIMINATE. AND I DON'T KNOW ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE THIS IS EVEN CLOSE -- FOR US TO CONSIDER THAT WOULD BE THE CASE CAN LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITIES DO BETTER NO QUESTION I SERVED ON HOUSING COMMISSION FOR MANY YEARS WE WORK HARD TO TRY AND REDUCE THE REGULATORY BARRIERS. TO PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND WE SHOULD ALL GO BACK TO OUR OWN DISTRICTS AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY HOUSING AUTHORITY'S BEING AS CONSUMER FRIENDLY -- AS SOME OF THE BETTER ONES THAT WERE MENTIONED -- IN TESTIMONY BUT GUYS WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL YOU WOULD NOT STAND FOR SUPPORTING A LANDLORD WHO CAME IN HERE AND SAID I WANT THE RIGHT IN THE CABIN AND EXPRESSED ABILITY IN THE STATE TO SAY I WILL NOT RENT ABOUT PEOPLE. NONE OF YOU WOULD VOTE FOR THAT HOW ON EARTH COULD YOU EVER SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT SUGGESTS THAT YOU CANNOT YOU COULD PUT OUT AN AD THAT SAYS I WILL NOT BEEN TO POOR PEOPLE. I MOVE THIS BILL AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THE SENATOR IS RIGHT ON THIS LEGISLATION MR TIP. IS YOUR IN A I I'M I'M REALLY TROUBLED BY THIS BILL AND AND AND HOW. I WANTED TO LEAST RAZOR A COUPLE ISSUES -- ONE YES MONEY MONEY IS MONEY AND IF SECTION EIGHT IS SUCH A CONVENIENT. AND FAIR PROGRAM FOR PROPERTY OWNER. COURSE MOST PEOPLE WOULD TAKE IT. SO SO WE HAVE ASK HERSELF WHY IS IT THAT A LOT OF PROPERTY OWNER. WOULD RATHER NOT TAKE SECTION EIGHT HOUSING IS T BECAUSE OF THE THE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS THAT. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- TO TO MAKE AN IBM MAY BE WORTHWHILE AND AND ALSO. THE OF THE THE IDEA THAT. WILL HAVE TO BE COMPELLED. INTO INTO DOING SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T WANT IS IS IS IS VERY TROUBLING IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE GOING TO A A PHYSICIAN'S AND AND SAY. DO YOU HAVE TO TO TAKE -- MEDI CAL PATIENTS EVEN IF WILL ONLY PAY YOU. A BUCK FOR TREATMENT. EIGHTY MINUTE IT'S IT'S A MINUTE THAT THAT THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL IS IS LIKE WE'RE FORCING. PEOPLE INTO DOING SOMETHING THAT THEY'LL LIKE IN IT IN TERM OF OF OF DISCRIMINATION NO I DON'T I I DON'T. THINK THAT. WE HAVE A A PROBLEM OF OF PROPERTY OWNER DISCRIMINATING ON THE BASIS OF RACE OR OR GENDER OR IN CLASS BUT NO. WE DO HAVE SOME COMMUNITY THAT DOES ADVERTISE SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. ONLY ALLOWS. SENIOR CITIZEN BILLS THAT. OUR FIFTY FIVE A ORDER MAY APPLY IF YOU'RE NOT WITHIN THE AGE GROUP THAN THERE IS SOME SORT OF SUCH PREFERENCES AS TO WHETHER. YOU FIT INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO IS SO IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY PEOPLE CREATING PREFERENCES YES. THERE ARE 	C THERE ARE MOBILE HOME PARK AND IN MY A DISTRICT THERE ARE APARTMENT COMPLEXES IN MY DISTRICT THAT DOES. HAVE. PREFERENCES ON THE TENANT ON THE KIND OF TENNIS TODAY. ONE OF BASED ON AGE BECAUSE THEY WANT A COMMUNITY JUST BEFORE SHE IS IT IS IT. AND SO I I I I THINK THAT IF IF THE A. V.. THE INTENTION OF THE AUTHOR IS TO ME. TO MAKE SURE THAT A THIS BILL DOES NOT MANDATE PEOPLE FROM DOING DO WHAT THEY DON'T WANT. THEN SHE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS. MISS QUIRK SILVA -- SENATOR. THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR UP FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ALSO I TO THOSE WHO SUPPORT AND ALSO OPPOSE THAT SOUNDS KIND OF AN INTERESTING BUT I THINK THAT -- THE MEMBER FROM -- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. GARDEN GROVE TALKED ABOUT PREFERENCES AND I THINK. YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE PREFERENCES ABOUT. WE WANT TO HAVE AS FRIENDS WHO WE WANT TO HAVE HIS NEIGHBORS WHO WE WANT TO OF YOU DON'T LIVE NEXT. TO AND I DO THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION -- FOR OWNERS TO THINK ABOUT SO EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BIASES WHY IS IT. SO RAMPANT THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TAKE SECTION. EIGHT I HAVE MY OPINION ABOUT THAT AND I DO KNOW IN THE PAST OVER YEARS I'VE HEARD THINGS ABOUT SECTION EIGHT THAT MAY BE TRUE OR NOT LIKE -- THAT'S WHERE ALL THE SECTION EIGHT PEOPLE LIVE SO THERE PROBABLY IS SOME TYPE OF APARTMENT OWNERS WHO ARE WILLING TO TAKE IT AND THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE SECTION EIGHT PEOPLE LIVING IN THERE. BUT MANY TIMES WE DON'T KNOW PEOPLE'S PERSONAL BUSINESS AND WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T -- AND WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF THEY'RE SECTION NADER NOT UNLESS SOMEBODY IS EXPLICITLY TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE. BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER IS THIS DISCLAIMER THAT SAYS NO SECTION EIGHT I HAVE A SON WHO'S TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD AND I JUST WENT OUT TO READ HIS VERY FIRST APARTMENT WITH A ROOMMATE IN LOS ANGELES. AND HE LOOKED THROUGH MANY MANY OF THOSE ADS AND I LOOKED ALONG WITH HIM -- FIRST COST WAS A HUGE -- BUT THEN SECOND HAVING RENTAL HISTORY AS A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD WAS ANOTHER BARRIER. AND RIGHT AWAY AS WE WERE LOOKING THROUGH THESE ADS I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HOW MANY SECTION. EIGHT DISCLAIMERS WERE ON THERE SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I AM STILL -- CONCERNED ABOUT THE MANDATE IN THE INTAKE BUT ON THE PART WHERE YOU SAID THE SENATE JUDICIARY [inaudible] COMMITTEE MENTIONS. THE CONTRACT. RIGHTS ON ITEM. FIVE YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE WANT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE I KNOW YOU WANT THE INTAKE LANGUAGE THE SECOND PART OF IT -- THE SENATOR IS TAKEN THE FIRST PART AND ON IT'S BEEN SAID THAT IF YOU AT THE SECOND YOU WOULD REMOVE OPPOSITION. BUT I THINK RIGHT TO THIS SAYING THAT. IN ESSENCE YOU'RE OPENING UP THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND THEY STILL HAVE THE CHOICE TO CHOOSE THE SECTION EIGHT PERSON. OR NOT -- SO I THINK THAT THAT THEY ARE NOT SAYING IF THERE'S THREE APPLICANTS YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE A SECTION EIGHT IS THAT CORRECT. JUST AS CORRECT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE THE SECTION EIGHT THERE I RECENTLY SEEN BY REMOVING THE SECTION EIGHT YES THERE WE MORE APPLICATIONS TO GO THROUGH. AND SOMEBODY MAY FIND SOMEBODY THAT'S A A BEFORE -- BUT IT DOESN'T SAY YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM SO DOES NOT TRUE THAT IS CORRECT OKAY BUT IF THEY DO CHOOSE TO TAKE THEM. THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH GOING THROUGH THE ORIENTATION AND GOING THROUGH THE INSPECTION. SACRAMENTO THAT IS CORRECT BUT ALSO WHEN ANYBODY IS RENTING A NEW APARTMENT UNLESS I'M COMPLETELY WRONG -- MARKET RATE ANY TYPE OF APARTMENT THERE ARE CERTAIN OF KIND OF SCENARIOS THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH WHETHER IT BE PAINTING CARPET ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT YOU WOULD DO TO PREPARE FOR A NEW PARK APARTMENT IS THAT CORRECT. THAT THAT'S CORRECT IT IN ADDITION TO AN ANNUAL INSPECTION REQUIRED -- OF ALL RENTAL UNITS -- BY YOUR LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY YOU KNOW WHETHER I HAVE A IT AS A NEW TO THIS COMING IN OR NOT I'M REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ANNUAL INSPECTION -- BITE MY LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITIES SO THAT TOO IS CORRECT. MATT AGAIN IN SOME WAYS IF YOU TURN THE OF THE SCENARIO AROUND. I DON'T THINK AN ANNUAL INSPECTION IS REQUIRED OF JUST A REGULAR. IS THAT NO IT IS. IN IN SOME JURISDICTIONS IT IS IT DEPENDS ON LOCAL REGULATIONS ARE FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES. THE CITY REGULARLY INSPECTS ALL RENTAL UNITS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE THEM MAINTAINED AND OUR MEETING BASIC. HEALTH AND SAFETY SO WHETHER YOU YOU. PREFERRED EXPECT A INSPECTION OR NOT I DO THINK THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS TO THAT IN THE GOOD NEWS WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR PROS AND CONS IS YOU DO WANT TO GET INTO THE APARTMENTS THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU ARE. RENT TEEN AND MAKE SURE THAT IN FACT THEY'RE NOT ONLY SAFE BUT THERE'S ISSUES IF THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THAT MAYBE A RENTER HASN'T EVEN BROUGHT UP TO YOU -- ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT YOU CAN CORRECT BEFORE IT BECOMES A HUGE LITIGATION ISSUE SO THAT A LONG WINDED WAY I DO SUPPORT THIS I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR -- I KNOW THAT SHE IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE INTAKE -- AND HAS CHOSEN PART OF IT -- YOU HAVE GIVEN. FROM THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- COMMITTEE THE ITEM THAT YOU BELIEVE. VERIFIES THAT THIS IS NOT A MANDATE -- THAT AGAIN AS WE MOVE FORWARD IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE NARRATIVE AND IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BY AND LARGE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EVERYBODY RUNNING TO THE SENATE. JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND LOOKING FOR THAT ITEM TO PROVE IT. WELL IT'S DOUBLE REFERRED SO THEY CAN RUN TO THE SIMILAR TO WHAT I CAN SAY IS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSE IT REALLY IS UP TO YOU TO LOOK AT THAT. ITEM AND MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU ARE THE ONES THAT ARE USING THAT LANGUAGE TO TO YOUR MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE THIS IS BEING EXPLAINED IN TWO VERY VERY DIFFERENT WAYS. AND SO WHERE IS THE TRUTH AND I THINK THAT IT IS UP TO YOU TO SAY WE ARE PART OF AN ORGANIZATION AND A MEMBERSHIP. THAT SAYS WE KNOW WE HAVE A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE WANT TO HOUSE PEOPLE THESE VOUCHERS -- CAN BE A TOOL TO GET PEOPLE ON HOUSING AND THIS BILL. IS NOT PERFECT BY ANY MEANS BUT IT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE THESE AND IF WE TAKE OFF THE DISCLAIMER YES YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE APPLICATIONS BUT THEY ALREADY DO NOW SO IT'S STILL UP TO YOU TO CHOOSE THE BEST APPLICANT THAT YOU FIT. FEEL FILL OF FITS INTO YOUR HOUSING. OR RENTAL SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL MR DEBORAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS WHAT I DID JUST ONE RESPOND -- TO SOME COMMENTS FROM THE VICE CHAIR -- I I THINK I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE POINTS YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE BUT WOULD JUST SUGGEST YOU YOU KNOW WE HAVE -- LAWS AND AND CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATE THAT PROHIBIT PEOPLE FROM DISCRIMINATING ON THE BASIS OF RACE AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS IN. ASIAN OF RENTAL HOUSING ANOTHER THANKS RIGHT AND SO WE'RE NOT SAYING TO IN THE STATE THAT YOU HAVE TO RENT TO BUY PEOPLE OR YOU HAVE TO RENT TO JEWS ARE YOU HAVE TO RENT. TO OTHER FOLKS BUT WE'RE SAYING IF YOU CHOOSE TO PUT YOUR PROPERTY ON THE MARKET IN AND TURNED TO THE RENTAL MARKET THEN YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE BASED ON THOSE CHARACTERISTICS AND SO. TO ME THIS IS FALSE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH -- WITH A STRAIGHTFORWARD ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE IT SAYS THAT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RIGHT TO RENT IN THE STATE AND ENTER INTO BUSINESS THEN YOU NEED TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A CERTAIN CLASS OF FOLKS -- AND AND I WILL SAY I AM SENSITIVE -- TO TO TO THE OPPOSITION IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MAYBE THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT CONCERNS -- I AM SENSITIVE TO OF BURDENSOME GOVERNMENT MANDATES ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THINGS THAT ARE GOING -- TO YOU KNOW BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS TO COMPLY WITH BUT I AM I AM PERSONALLY -- STRUGGLING TO SEE THAT HERE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S OVERLY BURDENSOME IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT -- RATHER THAN AN OUTRIGHT REJECTION UP FRONT YOU HAVE TO TAKE A A FAIR LOOK AT THAT PERSON CONSIDER THEM ND AND THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE AND I I AGREE WITH AS AN ATTORNEY GREAT THE ANALYSIS THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO RENT TO THAT PERSON OR OR OR OR LEAST. ABOUT PERSONAGES SAYS YOU CAN'T CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT CLASS OF FOLKS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN APPLY SO -- I'M HAPPY TO TO TO CONSIDER THAT MORNING OR IF TERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. TO RELIEVE SOME OF THOSE BURDENS AND OTHER WAYS I'D BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT -- TO YOU KNOW NOT UNNECESSARILY BURDEN FOLKS BUT I WOULD JUST TELL YOU AS I SAT HERE AND TRY TO LISTEN TO THIS TESTIMONY VERY CAREFULLY. I'M STRUGGLING TO SEE SOMETHING THAT SEEMS LIKE AN UNFAIR BURDEN ON ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- AND AND VERY OPEN IF YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT WE COULD DO -- TED TAX WOULD LIKE THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I WILL TAKE YOUR WORD THAT THERE IS AN OBJECTION TO THIS CLASS OF TENANTS. ON THAT IT'S JUST THE THE PROGRAM ITSELF AND AND THE PROMS ASSOCIATE WITH IT SO MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO. TO AS A AS A LEGISLATURE'S A STATE TO TO MAKE IT SO THAT MORE FOLKS ON SECTION EIGHT CAN CAN GET INTERPRETER RENTAL HOUSING -- AND FIVE DISAGREE A LOT WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM DIEGO AGAIN. YOU KNOW AT THIS TIME WHEN WE'RE FACING -- THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING IN THE STATE TO TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. TO GET A TO HOUSING&lt;/c&gt;</u> ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA COME IN A CHIP IN THE MONEY I MEAN THAT JUST SEEMS TO TURN AWAY FEDERAL DOLLARS TO HELP BRING FOLKS OFF THE STREET. THAT JUST SEEMS -- TREMENDOUSLY SHORT SIGHTED TO ME SO WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THAT -- IF THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE MISSED PLEASE LET ME KNOW BUT AS I SAID I MEAN I JUST. IT DOESN'T SEEM UNDULY BURDENSOME TO ME. MISTER CHAIRMAN MIGHT. HELP -- YES NO TO AND THING THINK SO MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND AND FOR US IN MEMORY QUIRK SILVA AS WELL -- AND FOR ALL THE OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS -- I THINK WE WOULD -- AT THIS JUNCTURE JUST IT JUST AGREE TO DISAGREE I MEAN I THINK -- YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO THE I I THINK THE MAIN CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THAT. THIS BILL DOES EFFECTIVELY MANDATE EVERY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY OWNERS DISPENSATION EIGHT IF THEY GET AN OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE SECTION EIGHT APPLICANT THEY HAVE TO TAKE THAT APPLICANT AND THEREFORE THEREFORE PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAMS AND THAT TO SIGN A CONTRACT. WHICH KNOWN AS A HAPPY CONTRACT HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS CONTRACT. AND CONTRACT WITH THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY -- AND THAT COMES ALL SORTS OF INSPECTIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS -- SO I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE -- WITH RESPECT -- TO OWNERS REQUIREMENTS -- SO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES I TRY TO BE BRIEF -- SO FOR INSTANCE THIS MORNING WE JUST HEARD FROM THE MEMBER IN IN LOS ANGELES -- VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATES IN SECTION A PROGRAM -- AND HE WAS TOLD ME AS A MULTI FAMILY BUILDING -- AND HE WAS TOLD BY A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY WHO'S MAKING AN INSPECTION. THAT -- AN OUTSIDE WALL SO IT'S A MULTI FAMILY BUILDING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WALL SO THERE'S A THERE'S A WALL THAT ON ONE SIDE IT'S INSIDE THE SAID THE SECTION EIGHT UNIT. BUT ON THE OUTSIDE IS THE EXTERIOR ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WALL THERE WAS SOME GRAFFITI AND HE WAS INFORMED BY THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY REPRESENTATIVE. THAT THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY WOULD BE SUSPENDING RENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE LANDLORD ON ALL THE SECTION EIGHT UNITS NOT JUST THAT PARTICULAR UNIT. AND SO THAT WE SEE IS INCREDIBLY ONEROUS NOW OF COURSE THAT BERRIES FROM LOCALITY TO LOCALITY SAYS JUST ONE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY -- AND SO WE SEE THAT IS VERY ONEROUS ANOTHER THING THAT'S NOT BEING MENTIONED IS THAT ALL RENTAL INCREASES HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY -- WE OBVIOUSLY HERE AT C. A. R. R. NEUTRON A. B. -- FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH IS ESTABLISHING A RANK CAP UP AND MAKES TO THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR WERE NEUTRAL ON THAT MEASURE AND WE'RE NEUTRAL ON IT BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT IT OFFERS A BALANCED APPROACH BETWEEN TEN A PROTECTIONS. AS WELL AS OFFERING A LANDLORD A FAIR RATE OF RETURN UNDER THIS BILL WE FEEL AS THOUGH IT CREATED DOUBLE STANDARD WE ARE. A MAIL RECEIVED AN OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE SECTION EIGHT APPLICANT THEY HAVE TO TAKE THAT APPLICANT THEY HAVE TO SIGN TO HAVE CONTRACTED LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY AND COMPLY WITH ALL THOSE PROVISIONS. INCLUDING PASSING RENT INCREASES IN AND HAVING THE RENT ESTABLISHED BY THE LOCAL AS A FORTY ITSELF LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY GETS ESTABLISHED THE RENT. SO. IN THIS AREA WHERE YOU HAD A BE FOURTEEN EIGHTY TO IN EFFECT NEXT YEAR AND YOU ALSO AT THIS BILL IN EFFECT YOU COULD HAVE AN INSTANCE WHERE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY SAYS. HEY WE'RE ONLY GONNA GET LET YOU HAVE THE RENT CPI PLUS 1% WERE JUST CPI FOR CPI PLUS 2% WHICH RUN CUT RENT WHICH WOULD RUN CONTRARY TO AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH IS CURRENTLY AT 7% PLUS REGIONAL CPI. AND SO THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY BURDENSOME BECAUSE AGAIN. ANY RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER SO IF YOU HAVE AN ELDERLY COUPLE THEY OWN ONE SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE. AND THEY GET IN OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE SUCH NEED APPLICANT BASS TAKE THAT APPLICANTS WITH HOUSING AUTHORITY SAYS YOU HAVE TO SET THE RENTED CPI THEY HAVE TO DO THAT. AND THAT COULD BE X. REALLY BURDENSOME FOR THEM AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS VERY MUCH A A LOCAL ISSUE AND AND AGAIN THIS THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH SECTION EIGHT BECAUSE WE DO SEE THE PROGRAM IS. AS HAVING POTENTIAL BUT AGAIN IT'S A FLOOD FEDERAL PROGRAMS IT'S IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THE STATE LEGISLATURES CURRENTLY TRYING TO INTERJECT ITSELF INTO THAT AND MANDATE A FLOOD FEDERAL PROGRAM -- WE ACTUALLY SEE IS MORE SOUND ALTERNATIVE -- SB FIVE TWENTY ONE WHICH AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED -- BY SENATOR PORTANTINO WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A TAX CREDIT TO INCENTIVIZE MORE LANDLORDS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM. AND SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE OUR ANY OUR NATIONAL ASSOCIATION REALTORS IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH CONGRESSIONAL BILL TO GET DELEGATION CURLY WORKING WITH CONGRESS AND WITH HUD TO TRY TO IMPROVE. THE FEDERAL PROGRAM ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- AND SO WE WE VERY MUCH ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE EFFORTS BUT FEEL THIS BILL IS SIMPLY NOT WORKABLE -- AND WE DO FEEL THAT A LOT OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED WITH RESPECT TO OUTRAGEOUS RENTAL -- PRICES -- AND HOMELESSNESS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT WE FEEL AS THOUGH WE ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED PARTICIPATED IN -- YOU KNOW WORKING WITH. YOURSELF ON AB ELEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT WORKING WITH -- THE CHAIR ON A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHEN WORKING ON OTHER MEASURES THE JUST CAUSE BILLY BE -- FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE WORKING ON NUMEROUS MEASURES BUT WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL IS SIMPLY NOT WORKABLE AND IT IS GOING TO CREATE. A MANDATE FOR A BIT FOR A A PROGRAM THAT WAS DESIGNED TO BE VOLUNTARY WHICH IS WHITE HAS THAT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION OTHER ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS. AND WE ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. BY FOUR TERM GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN WHEN HE SAID THAT THIS BILL DOES CREATE A MANDATE -- TO THE CHAIR OF A MAN. DISAPPEAR AS YOUR QUESTION ANSWERED OR YOU. OKAY MANAGEMENT KEEP IT BRIEF THE ONLY THING -- AT IS -- PARMER CONCERN TERMS THE MANDATE IS TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE THE PERSPECTIVE APPLICANT BECAUSE THE PROCESS PAYS ALL THE SOCIAL TO FEES. AND THEN THE OWNER IF THEY DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE SECTION PROGRAM IS LEFT. TO LET THE APPLICANT KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY. WERE CONCERNED THAT THAT ALSO OPENS UP LITIGATION EXPOSURE FOR US -- SO THAT'S WHY WOULD WE WANT THAT CLARIFICATION WITHIN TELLING WHICH BUT ALSO THE AT YEAH I JUST IT'S THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION ON SOME OF THE OTHER HOUSING MEASURES THAT WE'VE HAD -- MOVE THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE IN THROUGH THE EIGHT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE -- AND IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME THAT THE REAL -- AREA OF EMPHASIS NEEDS TO BE ON FIXING THE PROBLEM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND SO -- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ME SEEMS REASONABLE TEAMS APPROPRIATE IT SEEMS FAIRLY MODEST. AND YOU KNOW WITH THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT I THINK OTHERS WOULD BE IF THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO. TO TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK BETTER FOR MORE FOLKS SO THAT MORE FOLKS WAS SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS CAN GET INTO HOUSING IN A WAY THAT WORKS. FOR FOR THE OWNERS OF THE HOUSING I THINK THAT'S GREAT BY -- YOU KNOW SEEING SEEING AND LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY TODAY I THINK WHEN A SUPPORT THIS BILL. NUMBER SCORE SO HAS ONE MORE QUESTION. YEAH JUST ON THE POINT THAT WAS JUST BROUGHT UP RELATED -- TO THE RENT INCREASES. CONTROL HE WANTS IT THAT WAY -- RELATED TO OUR YOUR BILL THIS. GENTLEMAN JUST SAID. BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE VOUCHER SAYS ONE THING BUT RIGHT SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- WITH REGARD TO THE PAYMENT STANDARDS ON SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS THERE'S AN IMPORTANT REASON THAT THOSE ARE IN PLACE WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT THAT GOVERNMENT FUNDS ARE NOT BEING USED TO ESSENTIALLY OVER PAY. FOR PRIVATE APARTMENTS THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN SAYING THE HOUSING AUTHORITY MANDATES WHAT A LANDMARK IN CHARGE SO ABOUT HER COMES WITH A PAYMENT STANDARD MEANING THAT'S THE MAXIMUM RENT THAT -- THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IS GOING TO PAY FOR A GIVEN APARTMENT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S THE MAXIMUM RENT THAT A LANDMARK IN CHARGE THAT MEANS THAT WHEN THE VOUCHER HOLDER THEMSELF IS SHOPPING FOR APARTMENTS. JUST LIKE WHEN I'M SHOPPING FOR AN APARTMENT THEY HAVE TO FIND A PLACE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD WITHOUT VOUCHER -- SO IF THERE IS RENT BEING CHARGED OVER AND ABOVE THAT PAYMENT STANDARD THAT JUST MEANS THAT THAT WILL NOT BE A UNIT THAT THE HOUSING AUTHORITY CAN PAY FOR UNDER THAT PROGRAM. SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S AN ISSUE FOR THE TENANT NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE LANDMARK. ALL RIGHT AND JUST WHAT JUST ONE MORE -- NOT QUESTION BUT ON THIS BILL WOULD TAKE OFF THE DISCLAIMER OR THE LANGUAGE. ON WHEN SOMEBODY'S LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT SAYING THAT YOU CANNOT -- THAT THEY DON'T ACCEPT -- SECTION DATE BUT IS THERE A POSSIBILITY. TWO I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE IN THE APPLICATION OR SOMEWHERE ELSE I'M NOT TRYING TO MEND IT WELL WE'RE HERE BUT JUST AS AN OPTION IS. TO LET THE LANDLORDS KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT FORCED TO TAKE IT. SECTION. EIGHT HE SAID I'M SAYING THE ONE PART IS JUST SAY THEY'RE NOT DISCRIMINATING. THAT OFF THAT OUT I THINK IT GOES BACK TO THE TO THE TO THE AS THE REPRESENTED FROM KERR SAID WE HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE WITH INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW. AND IT'S OUR ARGUMENT THAT IT IT IS NOT A MANDATE [inaudible] ANA. AND I KNOW THE CAR IN THE APARTMENT SO SEE ATION IT'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF TIME -- DOING WORKSHOPS EDUCATING -- APARTMENT OWNERS AND LANDLORDS ABOUT CURRENT LAW. I WOULD HOPE THAT IF THIS WERE TO BECOME LAW THAT THEY WOULD DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT LANDLORDS ACROSS THE STATE WHO WHO PAY FEES AND LOOK TO THEM -- TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON HOW CURRENT IN NEW LOS IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS WOULD INFORM THEM OF THAT BUT AGAIN I THINK IT GETS BACK TO THIS CORE ISSUE. IT IS NOT A MANDATE AND WE'RE CLEAR THAT THE LANGUAGE SUPPORTS THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND AND LET ME SAYAT THE OUTSET. I'VE BEEN A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL SINCE THE BEGINNING I VERY RARELY CO AUTHOR BILLS THAT COME THROUGH THIS HOUSING COMMITTEE BUT THIS IS ONE THAT I DO THINK -- AND AGREE WITH OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO IS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND LET ME JUST FIRST ADDRESS I THINK A FEW MISCONCEPTIONS I LET ME JUST READ FROM THE ANALYSIS. THE AUTHOR THIS BILL HAS STATED IN HER HER OWN ANALYSIS OR HER -- FACT SHEET THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE LANDLORDS TO ACCEPT ANY TENANTS WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE DOES NOT PROHIBIT LANDLORDS FROM SCREENING FOR SUITABILITY DOES NOTHING TO PREVENT LANDLORDS FROM SETTING THEIR RENTS. A DESIRE LEVELS THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE I THINK OUR VICE CHAIR IT'S SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW THIS BILL WAS A CAN TO FORCING -- SOMEONE PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AT A DOLLAR THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THIS BILL SAYS. THAT YOU SHOULDN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEONE IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY. TO A YOU HAVE -- THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE YOU SHOULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOME AND MISS QUIRK SILVA I DO THINK HAD RAISED. THE CHALLENGE AROUND THE NARRATIVE AND AND LET ME SUGGEST A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO THINK ABOUT THE NARRATIVE. CURRENT LAW SAYS YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEONE BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE OR THEIR GENDER OR THEIR NATIONALITY BUT YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED. TO RENT TO SOMEONE BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE THEIR GENDER OR NATIONALITY IT SIMPLY SAYS GIVE THEM A FAIR SHOT. DON'T HAVE A SIGN ON THE DOOR THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T EVEN SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION. WE'RE JUST ASKING FOLKS TO SAY PUT ASIDE WHATEVER. STEREOTYPES YOU MAY HAVE AROUND SECTION EIGHT HOUSING APPLICANTS. YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY THAT PORTION WITH THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE AND THEY HAVE. OTHER ABILITIES POTENTIALLY TO PAY FOR THE BALANCE BUT GIVE THEM A FAIR SHOT -- AND IN MY MIND THAT'S ALL THIS DOES I HAVE FULL FAITH IN THE RENTAL HOUSING INDUSTRY THAT IF THIS WERE TO GO INTO EFFECT. THE MEMBERS OF THE ROW HOUSING INDUSTRY WOULD BE EDUCATED ON ALL OF THESE NUANCES OF THE LAW AND THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND. THAT THEY CAN'T PUT A SIGN UP THAT SAYS THOU SHALL NOT APPLY. THEY NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY. BUT THEY CAN MAKE A DECISION AS THEY WOULD IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE. REGARDLESS OF SOMEONE'S RACE OR RELIGION OR NATIONALITY OR ANY OF THE OTHER ENUMERATED CATEGORIES THAT ARE PROTECTED UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS AND SO I KNOW THAT'S A CONCEPT THAT'S BEEN A BIT DIFFICULT. FOR I THINK MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO GRAPPLE WITH BUT THAT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE -- AND WITH THAT I AM. HOPING THAT THIS COMMITTEE DOES MOVE THIS FORWARD WITHOUT FURTHER DISCUSSION. I'M GOING TO ASK THE AUTHOR OF ANY FINAL COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF I MAY ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN A VERY BRIEF CLOSE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU IT IS BEEN A RICH DEBATE -- BOTH IN THE HOUSE OF ORIGIN ON THE SENATE FLOOR -- SENATOR HERTZBERG HELD UP THE FOUR HUNDRED PAGE DOCUMENT ALL CONTRACT AND IT NOW IS THE FACT THAT PARTICULARLY WITH SOME. NEW CHANGES BEING PUT FORWARD BY OUR CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THERE'S REALLY SOME CAUSE FOR CONCERN I'M FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM ABOUT SOME ELEMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE ADDED IN THERE BY OUR NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION SO I THINK WE DO HAVE WORK. TO DO AND I CONGRATULATE THE NATIONAL REALTORS ASSOCIATION HOPE THAT WE ALL CAN OUT WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONTRACT REALLY REFLECTS THE CORE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. ARE ALSO A TIP MY HAT TO ALL OF THE HOUSING BILLS THAT CAR IS SUPPORTIVE OF ON AS I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD BE -- THEN I BUT I MUST KNOW BECAUSE I THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO REFERENCE A VETO FROM A FOUR TERM GOVERNOR OF THE BILL THAT ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS FROM OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE YOU WERE LISTED IN OPPOSITION TO FROM THE BEGINNING ANYWAY -- WITH REGARD TO SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS. I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT ONLY OCCURS AFTER REPEATED NOTICE AND THE EXAMPLE OF GRAFFITI WAS AN INTERESTING -- ONE IT IN YOUR PRIVATE RESIDENCE IN MANY MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE NEIGHBORING CITY OF WOODLAND ALL WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF GRAFFITI BEING. VISIBLE ON AN EXTERIOR WALL WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMED THE HOMEOWNER THAT THEY HAD AN OBLIGATION TO REMOVE THE GRAFFITI WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME OR THEY WOULD BE FINED BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SO THE GRAFFITI EXAMPLE I THINK WAS INTERESTING BUT LET ME BE CLEAR THAT SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS DOES NOT OCCUR. UNTIL REPEATED NOTICES HAVE BEEN ISSUED ALSO WITH REGARD TO GRAFFITI I I AM A LANDLORD IN THE MUNICIPALITY THAT REQUIRES ANNUAL INSPECTIONS. AND THOSE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS. NOT THE SECTION EIGHT INSPECTION THE REGULAR ANNUAL INSPECTION ALSO WOULD HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE WITH REGARD TO GRAFFITI SO THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE JUST AS A REGULAR LANDLORDS -- WHETHER YOU ARE TAKING A SECTION. EIGHT TENANT OR NOT. SENATOR PORTANTINO'S BILL IS A GREAT IDEA I HAPPILY VOTED FOR IT LET ME BE CLEAR THAT THE TWO BILLS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. IT'S IMPORTANT WHAT REGARD TO INSPECTIONS I THINK ALL OF US HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO UPHOLD THE KIND OF INTEGRITY OF THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS AND THAT WE WOULD WANT INSPECTIONS USED. FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY WHERE PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE USED TO PAY THE RENT WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. GUARANTEEING THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE BEING SPENT. IN HABITABLE -- PREMISES I THINK THAT'S OUR COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY. AGAIN WITH REGARD TO THE DELAYS -- THAT IT REQUIRES AYE. A HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE BASED ON OUR DIRECT CONTACT WITH HOUSING AUTHORITIES THE HOUSING AUTHORITY ASSOCIATIONS ICAL SPONSOR OF THE BILL I WILL RESTATE WITH ONE OF MY WITNESSES SAID IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY IT'S ONE BUSINESS DAY AFTER RECEIVING THE REQUEST. SANTA BARBARA COUNTY TURN AROUND IS VERY QUICKLY INSPECT UNITS WITHIN THE SAME DAY OR THE NEXT DAY -- DEPENDED UPON THE BILL ABILITY OF THE LANDLORD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THEY DO TEND TO HAVE LONGER INSPECTION TIMES I'M AWARE THAT AND HAVE STATED REPEATEDLY -- TO THE OPPOSITION WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO MEET WITH ME THAT I'M -- IT WANTING TO ENGAGE IN ORGANIZE A MEETING TO SIT DOWN WITH LA -- TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEIR STRUCTURAL BARRIERS MAY BE TO EXPEDITED INSPECTIONS ALTHOUGH EVEN FOR LA THERE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE MAJORITY OF THE INSPECTIONS ARE FINALIZED WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. I THINK WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THIRTY IN SIXTY DAYS WE ALL THOUGHT ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE LANDLORDS HAVE. A TURN AROUND TIME UPON WHICH THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE AT HEARING TO THE INSPECTIONS THAT THEY HAVE REPAIRS THEY HAVE TO MAKE. THAT'S UP TO THE LANDLORD WITH WITH REGARD TO THE REPEATEDLY WITH WHICH THEY GET THE WORK DONE TO ALLOW THEIR UNIT TO QUALIFY FOR SECTION -- EIGHT THIS BILL IS DOUBLE REFERRED IT'S GOING TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY -- FOR ANOTHER -- JUDICIARY COMMITTEE O WEIGH IN ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A MANDATE I AM RELYING ON THE INTERPRETATION LANGUAGE OF THE ATTORNEYS -- WHO WHO STAFF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND I STAND BY THEIR COMMITMENT THAT THIS IS NOT A MANDATE A PERSPECTIVE ALSO? OF THE PROPONENTS AND COAL -- SPONSORS OF THE BILL. I RESPECT AND APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE REALTORS IN APARTMENT OWNERS ASSOCIATION THAT IT IS NOT THEIR INTENT TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST POOR PEOPLE AND I HOLD YOU TO THAT COMMITMENT. I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO AND LA COUNTY WAIT ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT TO TEN YEARS TO GET A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. THEN DON'T LOSE THE PRIVILEGE. BECAUSE IT THEY TIME OUT. AND THEY AREN'T ABLE TO FIND A SINGLE UNIT THAT WILL ACCEPT IT WITHIN THE THIRTY OR SIXTY DAY PERIOD OF TIME THEY HAVE. TO FIND A LOCATION WITH THAT I ASK FOR RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER GLORIA IS OUR SECOND THE MOTION [inaudible] MADAM SECRETARY.
