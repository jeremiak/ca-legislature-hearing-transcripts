COMMUNITIES.

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:46.492
JUST TO BE CLEAR THE FEDERAL

CENSUS BUREAU WHICH YOU GUYS

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:52.331
ARE THERE ARE KNOWN ENGLISH

RESULT FROM YEARS OF RESEARCH

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:57.236
AND DATA ANALYSIS THEY'VE

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.038
IDENTIFIED TWELVE LANGUAGES TO

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:01.340
PRIORITIZE -- IN CALIFORNIA WILL

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:03.042
NEED TO EXPAND ON THAT NOTED

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:04.577
THAT THERE TWELVE LANGUAGES ARE

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:07.013
NOT THE HIGHEST A A TOP

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:07.647
TROUBLING WHICH IS HERE IN THE

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:08.681
STATE.

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.149
SO THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX TOPIC

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.984
AND OUR TEAM IS WORKED HARD OVER

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.386
THE LAST THREE MONTHS TO DEVELOP

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:14.520
A REASONED APPROACH WHICH WE

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:17.056
WILL SHARE AND I'LL DO MY BEST

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.824
TO EXPLAIN THIS -- THIS TOPIC IN

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.459
AND DIG INTO IT SO JUST A QUICK

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:22.228
OVERVIEW I'VE BEEN ASKED TO

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.030
COVER HIM FULL TOPICS SO ONE

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.932
PROVIDE OVERVIEW AGAIN WHAT THE

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:27.366
CENSUS IS RISK FEDERAL CENSUS

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:28.701
RESPONSIBLE.

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:29.869
FOR WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SENSE OF

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:31.871
ACTIVITIES LOOK LIKE AN OVERVIEW

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.406
OF CALIFORNIANS LANGUAGE AS WE

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.341
SPEAK WHAT IS LANGUAGE ACCESS

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.076
BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A STANDARD

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:38.144
DEFINITION.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.946
HOW WILL PARTNERS BE EXPECTED TO

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:41.514
APPROACH LANGUAGE ACCESS WHAT

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.648
ARE THE TIMELINES AND

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.351
REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH --

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:51.257
ARE IT REVISED PLANNED AND NEXT

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.458
STEPS.

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:53.459
SO JUST THE SEPARATION OF ROLES

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.226
AGAIN THE RULE THE FEDERAL

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:55.795
GOVERNMENT IS SEPARATE FROM OUR

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:56.329
ROLE THE CENSUS BUREAU IS

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:56.963
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENUMERATION

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:57.530
PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES THE

00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:58.898
PROGRAMMING OF THE QUESTION HERE

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.466
IN LANGUAGE ONLINE AS WELL AS

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:01.334
PRINTING.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.601
THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE CONTROL

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.036
OVER THE LANGUAGES THAT THE

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.338
QUESTIONERS PRINTED IN OR

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.039
PROGRAMMED SO THAT MAKES SENSE

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:08.341
IT'S KIND OF LIKE IN THE SUMMER

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:09.675
IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.210
CONTROLLED THE PRINTING.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.846
AND CONTENT OF ALL OR BALLOTS --

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.748
SO WE DON'T CONTROL IT LIKELY WE

00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:16.415
CONTROL THE BALLOT AT THE COUNTY

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:17.350
LEVEL HERE.

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:19.452
SO THE STATE OFFICE WE ARE TASK

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:20.720
CREATING THE STATE'S LARGEST

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.888
OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO REACH ALL

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.690
CALIFORNIANS AND OF COURSE OF

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.025
COURSE GET THEM TO RESPOND.

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.593
OF WE ARE SUPPLEMENTING WITH THE

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.629
US CENSUS BUREAU IS DOING BUT AS

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:31.764
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO SAID WE

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:33.666
CANNOT DEPEND ON IT WE CANNOT

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:34.767
DEPEND ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:35.868
SO WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:37.870
THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT RESOURCES.

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:39.305
TO GET ALL CALIFORNIANS COUNTED.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:41.340
SO HOW WILL WE REACH HOW

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:42.008
CALIFORNIA REACH THE HEART

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.010
ACCOUNT FOR THOSE JUST TUNING IN

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:45.778
REAL QUICK THE MISSION OF THE

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:46.946
COMPLETE COUNT OFFICE ISN'T

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:47.847
INSURER.

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:49.515
ALL CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR FAIR

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:50.850
SHARE FEDERAL RESOURCES AND

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.452
CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION TO

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.387
ENCOURAGE A FULL COUNT.

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:55.955
LET'S GET ALONG WITH WE REALLY

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.456
BOIL THAT DOWN WHAT IS THE ONE

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:58.824
THING.

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.092
THAT ALL OF US RELEASE MY TEAM

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:06.432
NEEDS TO DO TO ENSURE SUCCESS.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.400
THAT'S A GOOD EVERY CALIFORNIA'S

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:09.001
FOR THE FOR SIMPLE THEY DON'T

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:10.569
PULL IT OUT.

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:11.203
WE'RE GONNA COULD BE SUCCESSFUL

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:11.704
WE NEED TO FILL IT OUT

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:13.005
ACCURATELY AND COMPLETELY SO WE

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:13.672
MUST WORK TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.574
INCREASE ACCESS TO FOLKS CAN

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:16.809
EASILY TELL OF THE FORM.

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:19.111
WE MUST PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AT

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.546
THE RIGHT TIME.

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:21.847
IN THE RIGHT PLACE BY THE RIGHT

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:23.549
PEOPLE.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.384
SO BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED AND

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:27.053
BEST PRACTICES WE INTEND TO DO

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:27.887
THIS THROUGH QUESTIONER

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:30.456
ASSISTANCE CENTERS AND KIOSKS SO

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.391
I WILL NOTE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.759
WHEN WE DID THE OUT REACH

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:34.693
PROGRAM.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.562
THE THE ACTUAL BUDGET LINE ITEM

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.697
WAS NOT OUTRAGE IT WAS NONPROFIT

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.199
QUESTIONER ASSISTANCE CENTERS

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:41.634
BECAUSE WE KNEW IF WE PLACE

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.002
THOSE DOLLARS IN THOSE HARD TO

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.869
CONTRACTS.

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:44.970
THEY WOULD HAVE RETURN AND THE

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.705
DATA HAS SHOWN THAT THOSE AREAS

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:48.307
WE HAD ACTUAL PHYSICAL BRICKS

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.775
AND MORTAR QUESTION ASSISTANCE

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.077
CENTERS HAD ALMOST TRIPLE

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:54.647
INCREASE IN RESPONSE RATE FROM.

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:55.114
NINETEEN NINETY SO THE

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:55.815
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CENTERS AND

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:56.849
KIOSKS IS THAT CENTERS ARE

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.784
STAFFED WITH TRUSTED MESSENGERS

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.319
WHICH WILL PROVIDE IN LANGUAGE

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.521
SERVICES TO ASSIST WITH THE SELF

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:04.256
RESPONSE PROCESS.

00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:06.058
KIOSKS ALL SOARING LANGUAGE AND

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.426
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOME

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:08.761
CONTRACTORS AND COUNTIES HERE

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:10.496
THAT ARE TALK ABOUT THEIR KIOSKS

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:11.997
BUT THEY'RE ON STAFFED.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:14.100
SO WE WILL ALSO GOING TO

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.401
ENCOURAGE THE USE OF MANY

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:17.937
STRATEGIES INCLUDING DATA DRIVEN

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:18.938
TARGET OUT REACHING NO WE HAVE

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:20.739
THIS QUESTION EARLY ON WHAT DOES

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.074
THAT MEAN THAT INCLUDES PHONE

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:24.176
BANKING AND CANVASSING BUT THE

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:25.244
REASON WHY IT'S DATA DRIVEN.

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.545
IS BECAUSE IF AN ORGANIZATION

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:28.280
DOESN'T LOOK AT THE DATA AND

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:30.216
THEIR FOR CALLING JUST **** SORT

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:31.417
OF COLD CALLING THEY'RE NOT

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:32.051
GONNA BE EFFECTIVE IN THIS COULD

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:32.918
BE A WASTE.

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.020
AND IF YOU USE DATA GOING OUT

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:36.922
YOU CAN USE DATA COLLECTED IN SO

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:39.558
YOU CAN MEASURE -- TO SERVICE

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:40.826
CENTER -- BERG'S POINTYOU CAN

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:42.828
MEASURE THE RESULTS BY DAILY IN

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:44.730
AND DATA OUT WE ALSO ARE

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:46.699
ENCOURAGING CONDUCTING OF EVENTS

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:47.733
PUBLIC GATHERINGS.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.271
TOWN HALLS AND PROVIDING OF

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:53.806
MATERIALS.

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:54.373
SO WHAT IS LANGUAGE ACCESS

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.574
LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:56.442
ACCESS.

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:57.676
IS EQUAL AND MEANINGFUL ACCESS

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:59.078
FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT.

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.646
INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLE WITH

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:01.881
DISABILITIES.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.415
IN THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND IN

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:04.717
ACCESSIBLE FORMATS AND I WANT TO

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:07.286
MAKE SURE THAT WE HIGHLIGHT OF

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.321
THAT IT'S ALSO FOR PEOPLE WITH

00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:10.823
DISABILITIES AND TODAY WE HAD.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.291
A WEAPON ARE HOPE YOU GUYS TUNED

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:14.760
IN -- WITH THE HELP OF SOME KEY

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:16.529
PARTNERS THAT FOCUSED ON THE

00:13:16.595 --> 00:13:17.930
INCLUSION OF PEOPLE WITH

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:19.031
DISABILITIES FOR THE SENSES IT

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:20.266
WAS VERY INFORMATIVE.

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:21.600
AND WE HAD OVER TWO HUNDRED

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.402
PARTICIPANTS SO LIMITED ENGLISH

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.637
PROFICIENT INDIVIDUALS AND

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:25.771
PEOPLE DISABILITIES ARE

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:28.073
PROTECTED CLASS UNDER FEDERAL

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.474
STATE LAW.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.042
AND THE SENATE LANGUAGE ACCESS

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:31.443
SHOULD BE PRACTICAL AND

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.878
EFFECTIVE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:34.713
RESPONSIBLE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.181
AND IT CAN BE READILY

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:36.348
IMPLEMENTED.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:37.349
LANGUAGE ACCESS CAN HAVE

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:38.751
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.085
DEPENDING ON THE INDUSTRY WITH A

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:43.022
RECORD TO HOSPITALS BUT AS OF

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:44.190
TODAY.

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.224
THERE IS NO STANDARD DEFINITION

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:45.891
SO I APPRECIATE THIS HEARING TO

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.393
HELP US ALLCOME TOGETHER WITH

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:49.295
THE DEFINITION THAT MAKES SENSE

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.462
PERCENT THIS OUTRAGE.

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:51.897
SPEAKERS BY THE NUMBERS CENTER

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:54.233
PAT HAD MENTIONED -- HOW MANY

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.335
CALIFORNIANS ARE LIMITED ENGLISH

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:57.870
PROFICIENT OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

00:13:57.937 --> 00:13:59.171
REPORTEDLY SO THERE'S TWO

00:13:59.238 --> 00:13:59.939
HUNDRED TWENTY LANGUAGES THAT

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.774
ARE SPOKEN IN CALIFORNIA?

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.342
RECENT ACS STATE INDICATES IT'S

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:04.643
CLOSER TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.612
THIRTY BUT APPROXIMATELY 99% OF

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.347
CALIFORNIA SPEAKS THE SET

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:09.715
ROUGHLY THE SAME FIFTY LANGUAGES.

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:12.484
SO HERE ARE OUR CALIFORNIA'S TOP

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.119
TWELVE NON ENGLISH LANGUAGES

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:15.821
I'VE DONE THE BIG SIX AND THEN

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:17.022
THE OTHER ARE DOWN BELOW.

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:19.758
THAT'S NINETY THREE POINT 2% OF

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:21.727
ALL INDIVIDUAL ELLIE P. L. IN

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.963
THOSE TOP LANGUAGES AND GET

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.798
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- THE

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.066
CENSUS BUREAU THEIR TOP TOLD

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:29.702
LANGUAGES DO NOT MATCH OURS.

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:31.070
SO MOVING FORWARD SO WHO IS

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:33.405
RESPONSIBLE FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS.

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:34.807
IN A WILL BE IN A IN THREE WORDS

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:35.941
WE ALL ARE.

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.309
SO I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE --

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.777
REPRESENT HIS REPRESENTATIVES

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:42.348
FROM ALL OF THESE AREAS HERE

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:43.249
TODAY.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:44.550
SO SINCE WE PUBLISH THE REGIONAL

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:45.251
LANGUAGE AXE LANGUAGE AND

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:46.285
COMMUNICATION ACCESS STANDARDS

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:48.487
DRAFT IN MID MARCH WE RECEIVED

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:49.822
SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK FROM

00:14:49.888 --> 00:14:51.090
PARTNERS EXPERTS.

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:52.424
ARE ADVOCATES AND LEGISLATIVE

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:54.760
STAFF AND IN AN EFFORT TO CLOSE

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:55.995
TO PROVIDE CLEAR DIRECTION TO

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.963
ALL PARTNERS WE'VE USED THE

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.531
VARIOUS THEMES WE HEARD TO

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:00.966
IMPROVE OUR PLAN MOVING FORWARD

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.968
HERE'S SOME OF THE THEMES WE

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:03.602
HEARD AND FEEDBACK.

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.137
THEY SAID ANY REQUIREMENTS

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:06.605
BECAUSE THEY SAID THERE WEREN'T

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.007
ANY REQUIREMENTS IN OUR PREVIOUS

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.441
DROPPED THEIR STANDARDS THEY

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:10.776
SAID THEY SHOULD BE IN THE FORM

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:12.444
OF AN OPERATIONAL PLAN NOT JUST

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:15.180
STANDARDS. TO ALLOW FOR PARTNERS

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:16.682
TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.417
STANDARDS THAT TARGET ONLY THE

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:20.319
TOP SIX LANGUAGES WOULD EXCLUDE

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:21.387
SMALLER LINGUISTIC COMMUNITIES

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:22.121
WHEN WE HEARD THAT LOUD AND

00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:22.988
CLEAR.

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.723
THE DRAFT DID NOT SPECIFY

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.058
REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.826
THAT WOULD RESULT IN GUARANTEED

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:30.929
LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR THE HARDEST

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:32.464
TO KILL POPULATIONS.

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:33.832
WE ALSO HAD REQUESTED JUST

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:34.667
AGGREGATE LARGE LANGER GROUPS IN

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:35.401
THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGES WHICH WE

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:37.069
DID NOT GET DOWN TO THE DETAILS

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:37.736
OF THAT.

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:39.305
THERE WAS ALSO CONFUSION AROUND

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.406
REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.308
LANGUAGE ACCESS PLANS INCLUDING

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:43.942
COSTS AND COORDINATION OF

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:45.911
EFFORTS ACROSS ALL RESPONSIBLE

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:47.446
PARTIES AND WHAT THE STATE MIGHT

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.248
DO TO OFFSET AND LEVERAGE THOSE

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.382
COSTS SO THOSE ARE BUT TO THE

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.550
THEMES.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.218
SO AS A RESULT OF THAT FEEDBACK%

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:54.853
WE'RE DEVELOPING THE FOLLOWING

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.090
WERE USING LANGUAGE MICRO DATA.

00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:59.625
UP TO DEVELOP LANGUAGE SUPPORT

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.327
TRIGGERS WHICH ALSO SPEAK ABOUT

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.295
IN THE NEXT SLIDE WILL RELEASE A

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:04.763
NEW LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATIONS

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.999
ACCESS PLAN ON MAY SEVENTEENTH

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:07.966
WHICH WILL ADDRESS THE FEEDBACK

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:09.168
THAT WE HEARD AN OUTLINE

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:11.603
REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CONTRACTORS.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.539
THE REVISED PLAN WILL INCLUDE

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:15.174
HOW THE STATE INTENDS TO SUPPORT

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.842
LANGUAGE ACTORS ACTIVITIES WHICH

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:19.044
WILL INCLUDE A DOT ORG WEBSITE

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:20.879
TRANSLATED INTO THE TOP TWELVE

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:22.414
CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE LANGUAGES.

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.383
AND TRANSLATED COMMON COLLATERAL

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.684
TEMPLATES WHICH WERE WORKING

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:26.318
WITH OUR PARTNERS TO FIGURE OUT

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:27.653
WHAT ARE THOSE SO THEY DON'T

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.321
HAVE TO TRANSLATE THEM FIFTY

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:30.155
TIMES.

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:31.523
WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON USING

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.393
CONSCIOUS OF CONTRACTORSTRATEGIC PLANS AND OUR REGIONAL

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.261
PROGRAM MANAGERS FACILITATING

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.263
THE PARTNERS AND OUR UPCOMING

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.865
SUMMER IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:41.633
WORKSHOPS TO IDENTIFY WHERE

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.735
VARIOUS PARTNERS.

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.536
ACTIVITIES INTERSECT AND WHERE

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:46.238
THERE MIGHT BE GAPS.

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:47.373
SO THIS NEXT SLIDE I'M GONNA

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:49.174
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:53.712
MOST COMPLICATED SLIDE I HAVE.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:54.947
TO EXPLAINS A BEAR WITH ME I'LL

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:57.182
TRY I'LL TRY TO GO I WON'T TALK

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:57.950
IS FASTER THIS.

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.251
THE QUESTION IS HOW WILL

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:00.519
CONTRACTORS KNOW WHAT LANGUAGE

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:03.255
TO FOCUS ON SO FIRST OF ALL

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.790
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WILL BE

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.091
REQUIRED TO COVER ENGLISH AND

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.493
SPANISH.

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.228
SO WE MODELED OUR APPROACH AFTER

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:10.929
EXISTING LAWS WHICH YOU GUYS

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:12.464
HAVE IN YOUR HAND OUTS.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.866
AND SO HERE GOES THE THE REALLY

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:15.501
MORE TECHNICAL STUFF SO USING

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:18.103
LANGUAGE MICRO DATA WE DEVELOPED

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.271
LANGUAGE SUPPORT TRIGGERS WHEN I

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:20.773
SING BECAUSE OF THAT MEANS IT'S

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:21.840
AT THE THRESHOLD THAT TRIGGERS

00:17:21.907 --> 00:17:23.475
WHERE SUPPORT FOR A LANGUAGE

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.344
NEEDS TO BE -- IT NEEDS TO BE

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.112
PUT INTO PLACE -- WHICH

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.781
INDICATOR CONTRACTORS WHICH

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:30.616
LANGUAGES MUST BE SUPPORTED IN

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:31.950
THEIR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:35.020
WITH THESE LANGUAGE TRIGGERS 93%

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:36.789
OF ALL ELLIE P. INDIVIDUALS IN

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:39.858
THE STATE WILL BE COVERED AND SO

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:40.426
THAT'S KIND OF WE'RE TALKING

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:41.326
ABOUT.

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:42.361
THESE THIS WHOLE THING ALL

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:43.562
TOGETHER.

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:47.232
SO WE TOOK LA COUNTY OUT. TO

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:48.700
EXAMINE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:50.736
THE SKEW ALL THE DATA.

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:53.305
YEAH YEAH WE TOOK HIM OUT WE AND

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:54.239
WE WE WILL EXPLAIN WHAT WE DO

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:54.873
WITH THEM.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.375
BUT WE SAID THE LA COUNTY WOULD

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:58.143
BE REQUIRED LOOK AT THEIR

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.511
LANGUAGE TO COVER THE TOP TWELVE

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.079
LANGUAGE GROUPS WHICH IS

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:02.581
ACTUALLY FIFTEEN LANGUAGES.

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:04.450
WHICH WILL COVER NINETY FIVE

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:06.752
POINT NINE SIX UP PERCENT OF

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:07.886
THEIR ELLIE P. AND IN SOME OF

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:09.054
OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM I

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.756
THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.558
OUT HOW TO DO THAT -- BUT I WAS

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:14.226
HEARTENED TO HEAR THEY SAID AND

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:15.427
WE WANT TO DO MORE BECAUSE THEY

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:16.995
GET IT THEY GET LIKE A 100% A

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.130
100%.

00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:19.097
BUT IT JUST COMES DOWN TO

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:21.500
RESOURCES AND IUNDERSTAND THAT

LAST. 4%.

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.872
SO FOR THE REMAINING GEOGRAPHIC

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.907
DATA GROUPS WE SET A THRESHOLD

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:30.943

AND SO FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND WAS A

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.332
THRESHOLD OF ANY -- GEOGRAPHIC

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:55.868
AREA THAT HAD ABOVE FIFTY FOUR

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:56.869
THOUSAND AND THE MEDIAN THERE IS

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:59.638

DIRECTLY OTHER DIALECTS BY THE

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:36.868
WAY SO THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:38.036
THOSE ARE TWO LARGEST DIALECTS?

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:42.207

CHINESE AND THE JAPANESE I'M NOT

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:48.547
SURE WHY THEY'RE SEPARATED OUT

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:50.649
AS WE HAVE LANGUAGE GROUPS AND

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:52.317
THE LANGUAGES AND IS BASICALLY

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:53.552
HOW THE AMERICAN COMMITTEE

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:54.052
SURVEYS.

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:56.455
DATACOM'S THOUGH RIGHT YEAH SO

00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:58.490
IT IS SO THE LISTING I'M NOT

00:20:58.557 --> 00:21:00.692
SURE HOW.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.160
CHINESE IS SEPARATE FROM

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:03.729

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.166
THAT THE BUT I WOULD IMAGINE

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:09.401
THAT THE THAT WOULD BE LISTED

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:10.602
SEPARATELY.

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:12.571
AND AND BY THE WAY TO JUST MAKE

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:14.373
EVEN MORE INTERESTING -- THE

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:15.941
CHARACTERS ARE ACTUALLY ALL THE

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:18.010
SAME SO THE WRITTEN PART IS THE

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:20.545

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:21.980
WILL GET LIVE I'LL GET INTO THAT.

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.049
AT THAT BUT IT BUT THE DIAL

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.917
EXORCISTS ARE DIFFERENT LINK WE

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:27.786
OWN TERMS OF SPOKEN AND HEARD

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:30.789
LANGUAGE RIGHT.

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:31.957
YEAH THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WAS AND

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.091
SAY BUT I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT

00:21:33.158 --> 00:21:34.126
I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:35.060
ABOUT.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.395
A WIDE -- THERE'S ONLY ONLY

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.363
GOING TO BE SIMPLIFIED CHINESE

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.232
RATHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:41.533
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WHEN IT'S

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.467
TRADITIONAL CHINESE THAT

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:43.635
ENCOMPASSES.

00:21:43.702 --> 00:21:46.905
ALL OF THE CHINESE LIKE I CAN BE

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.707
TRADITIONAL BUT NOT SIMPLIFIED.

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:51.109
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S EVEN

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:55.414
A IN ANSWER TO THAT OR HOW HOW.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.049
I THINK WITH OKAY SO YEAH SO

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:58.216
YEAH SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:21:58.283 --> 00:21:59.217
WRITTEN PART SO WE HAVE DIALECTS

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:00.085
BUT THEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.953
SIMPLIFIED AND AND I DO WANT TO

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.288
GET TOO MUCH INTO THIS.

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:05.624
SO HE CAN CONTINUE PRESENTATION

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:06.992
BUT FOR EXAMPLE.

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:07.659

WE HAVE SOME WE MAY HAVE SOME

00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:19.438
ISSUES THERE WITH THAT SO THAT'S

00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:22.007
NOT A DIALECT THING BUT THAT HAS

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:23.108
TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE'S ABILITY

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:24.509

GOING OUT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.205
GROUPS SO THAT IS WHAT WE'RE

00:26:14.272 --> 00:26:15.173
GOING TO DO FOR THE STRATEGIC

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.342
PLAN ELEMENTS OF REQUIREMENT

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:24.616
THAT'S COMING UP TO DO.

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:27.118
MAY JUNE -- THE NEXT STEPS WE

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.653
HAVE OR LANGUAGE DATA WHICH WE

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.288
CONTROL THESE -- INTO INTO A

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:31.389
SPREAD SHEETS WERE TO PUBLISH

00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:32.557
THAT ON OUR WEBSITE I HAVE SOME

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:33.091
OF IT THEY'RE PRETTY LONG

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:34.659
SPREADSHEETS BY COUNTY.

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:36.561
ARE A MYSTERY CBO'S AND COUNTIES

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:38.096
ARE GOING TO IDENTIFY THOSE QVC

00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:38.863
LOCATIONS WITH THE LANGUAGE

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.432
SUPPORT CAPACITY TO INCLUDE IN

00:26:40.498 --> 00:26:41.399
THEIR STRATEGIC PLANS THAT WE

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:42.701
GET THAT SOME REALLY BE LIKE.

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:44.302
I KNOW I NEED SOMETHING HERE BUT

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:45.470
I CAN'T STOP IT.

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:46.738
AND SO THAT'S ABOUT HOW WE

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.373
COORDINATOR I DON'T I DON'T HAVE

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.908
A RESOURCE RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:51.876
IN JUNE BUT THAT'S WHAT JUNE

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:53.578
JULY AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER ABOUT.

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:54.913
IS MAKING SURE IN DURING OUR

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.048
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WORKSHOPS

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:57.816
THEY WERE BRINGING THE RIGHT

00:26:57.882 --> 00:26:59.985
FOLKS TO TO FILL THOSE SPOTS TO

00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.686
PROVIDE THAT ACCESS.

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:02.854
SO RPM'S AND CONTRACTORS ARE

00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:04.422
GOING TO IDENTIFY THOSE GAPS

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:06.691
AGAIN DO WE HAVE GAPS -- AND

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.293
THEN OR LANGUAGE EDUCATION

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.627
ACCESS PLAN THE WRITTEN ONE WILL

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:11.262
BE OUT ON THE SEVENTEENTH BUT WE

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:12.364
DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.498
TO WAIT BECAUSE THE DATA IS OUT

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:14.165
THERE.

00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:16.634
AND WITH THE MAPS ARE OUT THERE

00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:17.268
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR SHE

00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:18.003
PLANTS.

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:18.870
SO WITH THAT I KNOW THERE'S

00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:20.839
PROBABLY SOME QUESTIONS PROBABLY

00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:22.907
SOME TECHNICAL ONES THAT I'M NOT

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:26.811
ABLE TO ANSWER BUT HOW TO

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:38.757
NUMBER -- TWO KINDA YEAH GRAB MY

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:39.591

TOHAVE A DEEP DIVE ON IT WHAT'S

00:27:44.729 --> 00:27:45.697
WHAT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:47.198
ISSUE THAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:49.167
CONCERNS AND FEEDBACK FROM FROM

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:50.935

AND ALL SAVE OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:27:55.907 --> 00:27:56.541
FOR THE PROCESS OKAY SO

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:59.978
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:02.113
ASSEMBLY ROOM THIS SUMMER

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.515
KAMLAGER-DOVE.

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:04.716
THE GIANTS FOR OPENING UP THE

00:28:04.783 --> 00:28:05.216
HORNET'S NEST EARLIER.

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:07.085
BUT I THINK IT BEGS THE QUESTION

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:08.420
TRULY ABOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:09.954
ESPECIALLY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:11.456
I MEAN THERE ARE HUNDRED AND

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:12.157
TWENTY SIX LANGUAGES AND

00:28:12.223 --> 00:28:13.691
DIALECTS ARE SPOKEN IN LA

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:14.959
UNIFIED.

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:18.630
AND THAT SHOULD BE AN INDICATION --

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:21.099
YOU KNOW ON ITS OWN THAT HOW WE

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:23.535
TACKLE THIS ISSUE -- NEEDS TO BE

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.070
REALLY THOUGHTFUL AND EXPANSIVE

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:28.106
BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS

00:28:30.608 --> 00:28:32.010
FROM OUR LIVING IN HARD TO COUNT.

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:33.978

OR DO THE WORK WITH THE A. CBO'S

00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:40.051
WILL BE CRITICAL -- AND

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:41.352
RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENCE

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:43.788
BETWEEN NON WRITTEN LANGUAGES

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.123
THAT ARE USED IN WRITTEN

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.257
LANGUAGES.

00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:48.693
AND WHERE THAT MEDIUM IS SO

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.861
CONTINUED KIND OF THOUGHT ON

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:52.130

PRESENTING AT THE EXPENSE OF

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:58.303

RESOURCES THAT YEAR -- THAT THEY

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:01.132
APPLIED FOR OUR DAY GOING TO GET

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:02.734
ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.

00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:06.771
VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU HAD TO

00:30:06.838 --> 00:30:10.975

IN ENGLISH.

00:30:23.354 --> 00:30:24.322
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:25.924
BECAUSE SECTION ONE POINT ONE IS

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.292

CLOSER TO A MANDATE.

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:56.901
SO THAT'S THE COUNTIES ON THE A

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:59.470
CBO'S THEY DID APPLYING AND

LANGUAGE SKILLS BASED AND THEIR

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.077

STRATEGIC PLANS BECAUSE WE CHOSE

00:34:11.482 --> 00:34:12.917
THEM BECAUSE THEY SHOW THAT THEY

GAPS ARE NOT GOING TO BE DONE IN

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.266

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:31.369
THEIR CAPACITIES.

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:33.104
I THINK PERHAPS PART OF THE

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:34.672
REASON YOU'RE HEARING A LITTLE

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:35.406

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:40.111
FROM PEOPLE ABOUT REQUIREMENTS

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:40.978
IS IS THAT.

00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:42.180
SO PEOPLE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:42.480
CAPACITIES.

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:43.948
DO THEY ALL ADD UP.

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:46.751
SUFFICIENTLY TO ACHIEVE.

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:48.286
THE STANDARD THAT YOU'VE PUT OUT

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:49.987
HERE I MEAN BECAUSE AND IN THE

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:53.691
END -- YEAH PEOPLE MAY HAVE

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:54.992
VARYING CAPACITIES AND I SURE

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:56.561
YOU PICK PEOPLE WHO HAVE GREATER

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:59.997
CAPACITIES BUT EVEN THAT AND

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:00.731

00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:01.132
RESOURCES.

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:04.836

00:35:04.902 --> 00:35:06.270
IN IN THE END ARE WE GOING TO

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:07.939

TWO VERY IMPORTANT LANGUAGES --

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:36.834

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:38.636
LANGUAGES OUT THERE -- FOR

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:39.937

IN SMALLER COUNTIES IT MADE THEM.

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:17.375
THE COULD BARELY GET TO THE TOP

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:19.043

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:44.302
ALL RIGHT BUT BUT LET'S THE BUT

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:46.704
WE HAVE LARGER COUNTIES YEAH.

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:48.472
RIGHT AND SO THE PROBLEM IS

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:49.540
YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT THE

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:51.309
SMALL AREA AS WAS SMALLER COUNTY

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:52.510
OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE THERE ARE

00:36:52.577 --> 00:36:54.946
VERY IMPORTANT AND THEY REALIZE

00:36:55.012 --> 00:36:56.013
THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.548
THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE COVERS

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:58.816
MANY LANGUAGES.

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:01.786
BUT YOU CAN'T SAY WELL BECAUSE

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:03.521
WHICH COUNTY WHICH COUNTY YOU

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:04.889
TALK TO VETERANS YES YOU DID

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:05.990
BECAUSE SUTTER BASICALLY IF YOU

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:07.091
GO DOWN THE SIX AND ELEVEN

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:08.626
PEOPLE THAT YOU APPLY THE SAME

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.828
STANDARD TO SACRAMENTO OR

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.964
CERTAINLY TO LA.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.564
RIGHT THAT'S WHY WE DID THESE

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:14.498
NEW TERMS BECAUSE ORIGINALLY THE

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.901
TOP SIX WOULDN'T AND IT WAS

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:17.501
ACTION THAT WAS LOW IT'S WHEN

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:18.903
THEY'RE THE TOP SIX WASN'T

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.404
EQUITABLE SO WE WENT BACK AND

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:21.505
DID OUR RESEARCH.

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:23.074
AND THAT'S WHY WE TOOK LA OUT OF

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.909
THE MIX BECAUSE IT SKEWS IT AND

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:27.411
WE TOOK THE MEDIAN OF THOSE

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:29.480
FORTY GEOGRAPHIC WERE RE DUG

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:30.748
DEEPER WITH THE MICRA DATA FROM.

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.250
HOMES AND WE LOOKED AT IT AND WE

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:35.019
SAID FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND IS THE

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.120
MEDIAN AND EVERYBODY.

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:36.754
THIS IS OF THAT -- SO WHAT I'M

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:38.723
SAYING IS IS THAT THAT'S WHY I

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:39.824
THINK PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.726
WATER REQUIREMENTS RIGHT I MEAN

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.828
SO I HEAR IS THAT YOU ASK PEOPLE

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:46.130
TO DESCRIBE THE CAPACITY.

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:47.164
AND THAT'S GREAT.

00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:50.735
AND I UNDER THAT RIGHT BUT IN

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:51.836
THE END [inaudible]

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:53.671
WHEN CENSUS?

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:55.272
DAY COMES OUR SENSES MONTH APRIL.

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:56.107
TWENTY TWENTY WE NEED TO BE SURE

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:57.308
THE PEOPLE ARE PLACED AT LEAST

00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:58.976
MEET THE STANDARDS THAT YOU JUST

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:00.778
DESCRIBED HERE TODAY AND CAN YOU

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:02.146
GUARANTEE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:04.682
AND IF THE IF IT TURNS OUT THE

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:07.685
TOWNIES AND THE AC VEAS AND I

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:08.219
REALIZE THERE'S A BIT OF

00:38:08.285 --> 00:38:09.020
INTERWEAVING.

00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:10.788
ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET THAT

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:13.157
STANDARD AND WE KNOW THIS IS

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:14.792
THIS WE'RE HEADING INTO IT WHAT

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:15.926
ARE WE GOING TO DO TO FILL IN

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:17.561
THAT GAP BEFORE CENSUS DAY

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:18.796
HAPPENS.

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:21.432
SO WE ARE YOU KNOW LESS THAN A

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:22.166
YEAR OUT.

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:23.567
OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLANS

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:25.069
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.737
HOUSE THE COUNTIES AND THE CBO

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:27.905
IS DO YOU HAVE THAT CAPACITY I

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:28.372
CAN'T.

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:29.540
LOOK AT MY COST BY HAVE TO ASK

00:38:29.607 --> 00:38:31.275
THEM DO YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY IN

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:32.710
YOUR PLANNING THAT YOU'RE GOING

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:33.310
TO DO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:33.911
MONTHS.

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:34.545
DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:36.147
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THAT

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:37.581
CAPACITY BUT THEY HAVE TO START

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:38.949
WITH WHERE THE MAP IS AND WHERE

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:40.017
THE PEOPLE ARE.

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:41.786
AND AS WE IDENTIFY THOSE THEN

00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:43.621
WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO OTHER

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.523
PRIVATE FUNDING IS THE

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:46.290
GOVERNOR'S CHIEF OF STAFF SAID

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:48.192
WE EXPECT PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS TO

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:50.161
PUT DOLLARS UP FRONT. TO FOR

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:51.328
SOME OF THOSE MAJOR SMALLER

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:53.431
LANGUAGES THAT ARE COVERED OKAY

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:54.965
SO I A SCIENCE SO I JUST WANT TO

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.300
CLARIFY WHAT I'M HEARING NOW IS

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:58.436
THAT BECAUSE THE OTHER PART

00:38:58.502 --> 00:38:59.136
THAT'S GOING ON HERE THAT I

00:38:59.203 --> 00:38:59.570
THINK.

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:00.471
MOST OF THE MEMBERS THE COMMUTER

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:01.672
WHERE'S WE'RE GOING TO OUR

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:03.741
BUDGET PROCESS RATES MAY WILL

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.543
HAVE MAY REVISE AND PROBABLY

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:06.944
COUPLE WEKS.

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.280
AND THEN WILL PROVE A BUDGETS --

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:10.881
HOPEFULLY SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:13.684
BEFORE THE END OF JUNE -- SO BUT

00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:16.053
WHAT YOU JUST WHAT YOU JUST SAID

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.288
IN MY CLEAR FIVE BE SURE THAT I

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:18.589
HEARD IT CORRECTLY.

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:21.025
THAT THE EXPECTATION IS IS THAT

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:26.797
IF THAT WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:27.865
PLANNING IF THERE IS A GAP.

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:28.466
THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING PRIVATE

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:28.999
FOUNDATIONS THE FIND THE

00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:30.501
RESOURCES TO COVER THAT GAP.

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:31.569
I'M GAS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.537
COUNTY TO COUNTY YOU'LL NOTICE

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:36.240
THAT A TOP LANGUAGE THAT'S OVER

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:38.175
3% TRIGGER IN FRESNO.

00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:40.077
IT IN THEIR TOP ONE AND IT MAY

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:41.545
NOT BE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:42.513
I MEAN MAYBE AMONG IS ON THEIR

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.049
TOP. 3% AND ABOVE BUT IS IT'S

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:46.517
BELOW IN TERMS OF SACRAMENTO

00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:47.985
THEY HAVE THAT COVERAGE WE WANT

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:49.453
TO MARRY THEM UP TO MAKE SURE

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.121
THAT.

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:51.489
THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:53.090
DOING THAT CAN PROVIDE THE

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.592
TRANSLATED MATERIALS AND SHARE

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:55.960
THOSE.

00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:58.863
WILL BE SHARING ACROSS COUNTIES

00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:00.431
OKAY APPRECIATE SHARING.

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:01.265
BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.467
WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:04.735
TO BE SURE WE PROVIDE THAT

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:06.003
LANGUAGE ACCESS I THINK THAT'S

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.638
ALWAYS BEEN THE INTENTION OF THE

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:08.239
LEGISLATURE.

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:11.509
AND I AND MY COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.077
FOR THEMSELVES RIGHT NOW I'M NOT

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.378
FEELING PARTICULARLY CONFIDENT

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:17.515
FOR SOME REASON.

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:18.749
I WANT TO AND HAVE THE REASSURED

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:20.785
THAT WE WILL CLOSE THAT GAP BY

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.620
APRIL.

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:23.287
TWENTY TWENTY AND I DON'T DECIDE

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:24.755

GREAT YOU'RE ASKING PEOPLE OUT-CAPACITY.

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:28.325
BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:29.794
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.461
AND I WANNA BE SURE AM OF

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:32.096
PUTTING A LOT OF RESOURCES INTO

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:32.930
THIS.

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:33.931
AND OTHER HEARING BACK FROM

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:35.299
PEOPLE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:38.869
CLARITY AND ALSO THAT THERE MAY

00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:40.204
BE INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES.

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.705
RIGHT OR THERE COULD BE ENOUGH

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.140
RESOURCES THE FACT OF THE MATTER

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.642

DEDICATED TO THIS EFFORT.

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:52.483
AND AS WE GO THROUGH THE

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.185
PLANNING PROCESS THAT'S THE ONLY

00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:55.352
WAY THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:56.754
ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:58.088
WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT GAPS WHERE

00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:59.690
WE NEED MANY MORE MONEY I CAN'T

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:01.458

WE'RE AT WE WILL NOT GET DOWN TO

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:08.399
THAT LEVEL UNTIL WE'VE.

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:10.401

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:49.926

THEY CAN GET THE HELP SO FOR

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:26.730
EXAMPLE IN.

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:28.632
TWENTY TEN AND IN -- TWO

00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:29.666
THOUSAND A LOT OF THE JUST TAKE

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:30.434
IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

CHURCHES.

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:47.984
OF IN OTHER AREAS WHERE PEOPLE

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:49.486
GET THEM WE EXPECT OTHER ETHNIC

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:52.155
MEDIA TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:53.156
UP QUESTION YOUR ASSISTANCE

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:54.591
CENTERS THAT ARE YOU TO RUN BY

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:56.593
THE CBO IS OF THE COUNTIES.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.328
INSERTED INTO THAT ETHIC MEDIA

00:49:58.395 --> 00:50:00.030
SO PEOPLE KNOW WHERE TO GO AND

00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:00.697
THAT'S PART OF YOUR V. D. R. E.

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:02.399
YES OKAY AND AND ACTUALLY THE

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:03.333
OTHER PART THE QUESTION WHICH

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.701
YOU HAVE ANSWERED YET IS SO FOR

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.436
THE MAY SEVENTEENTH LANGUAGE

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:12.376
ACCESS PLAN THE ONE THAT WE WERE

00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:13.510
EXPECTING YET. FOR THIS HEARING.

00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:14.044
WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THAT

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:16.146
PARTICULAR -- REPORT GOING TO

00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:18.014
ENCOMPASSES IT DOES INCLUDE MEET

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:19.216
THE LANGUAGE ASPECT OF MEDIA AS

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:21.385
IT JUST FOCUSED ON THE COUNTIES

00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:22.953
IN THE A CBO ACTIVITIES.

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:24.488
CAN JUST SPEAK TO WHAT WE SHOULD

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:26.723
BE EXPECTING ON MAY SEVENTEENTH

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.792
IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL. TO EXPECT

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.127
IN THAT DOCUMENT I REALIZE THE

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:31.094
DETAILS ARE STILL BEING WORKED

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.596
OUT THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT OUT YET

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:34.331
BUT WHAT WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:35.332
THAT PARTICULAR DOCUMENT THE

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:37.100
FOCUS WILL BE ON OUR CONTRACTORS

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:38.802
THAT'S THE MEDIA -- CONTRACT IS

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.137
STILL OUT FOR BID WE WANT TO

00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:41.471
WAIT TILL THAT COMES IN AND THEN

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:42.739
WILL PROVIDE THAT SIMPLY TO THEM

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:44.474
BECAUSE IT'S ONE CONTRACTOR.

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.142
BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO HOLD THAT

00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:49.846
UP ALL IN TERMS OF THE COUNTY IN

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:51.047
THE C. B. AS IN THE CBO.

00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:51.948
SO THAT MAY SEVENTEENTH LANGUAGE

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:54.384
ACCESS PLANS JUST FOCUSED ON THE

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:55.585
THE CBO'S AND COUNTIES OR THE

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:57.187
GROUND PART OF THE ACTIVITIES

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:58.155
OKAY.

00:50:58.221 --> 00:51:00.424
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION IS

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.659
IS THAT -- SO I CERTAINLY

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.327
APPRECIATE YOU KNOW YOU TALK

00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:05.762
ABOUT THE THE TRIGGER.

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:08.398
LANGUAGES HOWEVER I WOULD MAKE

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.767
NOTE THAT -- LEAST OUTSIDE OF LA

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.402
COUNTY EVEN WITH LA COUNTY WERE

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:14.504
AT 96% IT'S ONE EIGHT NINETY ONE

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:17.207
POINT 3% SO THAT'S STILL A LOT

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:18.775
OF PEOPLE GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S A

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:20.610
BIG STATE WHO STILL AREN'T

00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:21.678
COVERED.

00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:25.081
ARE THERE ANY EXPECTATIONS THAT.

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:27.651
ARE A C. B. AS DO ANYTHING TO

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:30.153
TRY TO COVER THAT REMAINING NINE

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.588
PERCENT'S.

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:32.489
YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF TRYING TO

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:34.658
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BRIDGE THE

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:38.061
GAP -- ON ON THAT THINKING ABOUT

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:40.997
SOME ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES -- TO

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.566
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:43.700
SO I THINK THAT WE JUST YOU HAVE

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:44.701
TO LOOK CLOSER THE DATA WHAT ARE

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:46.403
THOSE ACTUAL LANGUAGES TO FIGURE

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:47.404
OUT WHAT ARE THE IN ROADS

00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:49.105
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE KIND OF

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:51.041
LIKE SWISS GERMAN AND SO THOSE

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:52.142
ONES YOU COULD PROBABLY.

00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:53.176
YOU KNOW THE WAY I SEE THE SOME

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:54.311
OF THOSE LANGUAGES ARE GOING TO

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:55.545
BE HIT NOT SPECIFICALLY THE

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:57.214
LANGUAGE ACCESS THEY MAYBE HAD

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.515
THROUGH SECTOR OUT REACH MAYBE

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:00.283
HIT THERE ARE K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:01.251
OR EDUCATIONAL AVERAGE.

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:02.052
THE BABY HAD THROUGH OUR

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:05.222
STATEWIDE OUTREACH SO.

00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:07.357
BUT WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE.

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:09.793
TWO OKAY WELL I I HOPE THAT THIS

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.627
ITEM BE THERE MAY BE ALTERNATIVE

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:11.561
STRATEGIES OTHER THAN SIMPLY

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.697
PROVIDING GET OUT THAT LANGUAGE

00:52:13.763 --> 00:52:15.465
IT CETERA WHEN YOU LOOK AT BUT I

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:17.133
HOPE THAT THERE IS A STRATEGY AN

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.470
EXPECTATION THAT THERE SOME FORM

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:22.172
OF OUT REACH. TO THOSE

00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:24.574
POPULATIONS BECAUSE OF THE RACE

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:25.909
BASICALLY YOU'VE WRITTEN OFF

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:28.578
TRYING TO GET ABOUT 9% OR EIGHT

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.847
EIGHT POINT. 7% OF THOSE PEOPLE

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:32.315
IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS NOT

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:34.184
HOUSEHOLDS SO WE'RE NOT SURE IF

00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:35.151
THERE'S A HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD THAT

00:52:35.218 --> 00:52:36.920
MAY SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:37.587
OR ENGLISH.

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:39.556
SO THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THE

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.858
DATA -- THAT WE HAVE TO DIG

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:43.860
DEEPER IN DEBT AND I WOULD ALSO

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:45.295
MAKE NOTE THAT SOMETIMES WELL

00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:47.597
CERTAINLY ENGLISH'S SERVE THE

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:49.099
PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND AND THIS.

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:50.867
STATE SOME SOME OF THE OTHER

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:51.635
LANGUAGES DEPENDING FOR EXAMPLE

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:53.703
AND IF IT COULD BE THAT THEY MAY

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.973
ACTUALLY NO NOT A T. I. LANGUAGE.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:57.741
THAT THAT MAY BE THE LINKING

00:52:57.807 --> 00:52:59.276
LANGUAGE SHOULD NOT ALWAYS

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:00.443
ENGLISH IS BEING THE LANGUAGE MY

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:01.878
MY DRIVE PEOPLE TO GIVEN THE

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:03.980
FACT THAT THE US CENSUS WILL BE

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:06.716
IN SOME OTHER LANGUAGES SO.

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:10.687
YES -- SUMMER READY JONES SAWYER.

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:12.622
HI IN IT.

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:13.056
ANGIE YOU BROUGHT UP

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:13.356
[inaudible]

00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:15.225
THE COMMUNICATION -- ASPECT IN

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:18.595
AND AND I'M TRYING TO GET A GET

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:20.730
A FEELING OF HOW FLEXIBLE THAT

00:53:20.797 --> 00:53:21.097
IS.

00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:22.732
IN THAT ARE PROBABLY THE BEST

00:53:22.799 --> 00:53:25.335
WAY TO DO THIS JUST BY EXAMPLE --

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:26.870
YES YOU MAY BE WORKING WITH THE

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:28.505
LOS ANGELES SENTINEL WHICH IS

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:30.774

ANGELES -- AND YES THEY HAVE A

00:53:33.843 --> 00:53:35.145
REGULAR CIRCULATION BUT THEY

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:38.481
ALSO HAVE -- SOME CALLED CASE TO

00:53:38.548 --> 00:53:40.584
SEOUL WHICH HAS ABOUT A HALF A

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.419
MILLION AFTER AMERICANS MANY OF

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:44.120
WHOM ARE IN MISS CALM WATERS

00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:47.757
DISTRICT -- FROM MY DISTRICT

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:50.527
THAT SHOW UP -- BUT IT SOUNDS

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:51.528
LIKE YOU'RE DRIVING HIM. TO A

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:52.062
CERTAIN PLACE AS OPPOSED.

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:53.496
TO YOU NOW HAVE A HALF A MILLION

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:56.766
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN ONE SPOT.

00:53:56.833 --> 00:53:58.301
AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL THEM

00:53:58.368 --> 00:54:01.037
LEAVE HERE. TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:02.672
TO DO THE SENSES WHEN YOU COULD

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:04.274
HAVE A CAPTURED GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:05.909
RIGHT THERE.

00:54:05.976 --> 00:54:08.111
AND THEN HAVE CENTS WHATEVER

00:54:08.178 --> 00:54:10.714
THESE PEOPLE CALL THERE TO

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.215
ACTUALLY DO THAT AS THIS.

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.584
MEDIA PLAN THAT THAT FLEXIBLE

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:17.887
ROBUST ENOUGH OR IS IT.

00:54:17.954 --> 00:54:19.889
YOU HAVE TO DO AN AT AND THAT'S

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:21.691
IT ARE YOU HAVE. TO WEBSITE OR

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:25.495
pAND YOU CAN'T.

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:26.963
SO THE THE SITES WE HAVE BEFORE

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.465
IS AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:29.733
RIGHT TIME BY THE RIGHT PEOPLE

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:30.900
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO GO

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.602
TO A BRICKS AND MORTAR IT MEANS

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.371
WE DID SOCCER TOURNAMENTS.

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:37.407
WE DID YOU KNOW FOOTBALL GAMES

00:54:37.474 --> 00:54:38.642
WE DID WHAT A YOU KNOW.

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:41.111
OF FESTIVALS THE VIETNAMESE YOU

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:44.347

WHEELS TO FILL THESE THINGS OUT

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:52.422
TO HELP THAT.

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:54.391
SO NO ABSOLUTELY NOT EVEN THE

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:55.825
MEDIA BUT EVEN THE CBO'S ARE IN

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:57.527

WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE IT'S ABOUT

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:02.966
BRING IT TO WHERE THEY ARE

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:04.200
WHETHER THAT'S IN A HARD TO

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:06.069
COUNT COMMUNITY IN A COMMUNITY

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:07.837
CENTER WE'RE GOING TO THE THIS

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:08.805
WONDERFUL EVENT AND SOUNDS LIKE

WHERE PEOPLE GOING TO BE?

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:10.840
AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE GO OUT

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:12.709
AND MASS AND ARE ABLE TO GET

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:15.045
PEOPLE TO RESPOND SO ABSOLUTELY

00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:17.313
SAID IN A BOOTH OR PAY FOR BOOKS

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.114
AND ALL OF THAT IS PART OF IT

00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:18.314
OKAY.

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:20.316
THE IN PERSON WE'DLOVE TO HEAR

00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:21.918
AN INTO MY DISTRICT THERE'S

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:24.220
FESTIVALS ALL OVER THE PLACE OF

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:26.790
WHAT I SEE A BIG FERRIS WHEELS

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:26.990
LIKE.

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:28.191
JUST SEVERAL TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:29.325
SHOWING UP I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:31.695
BE ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH THAT

00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:32.095
THIS.

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:34.197
IS ESPECIALLY THE LATINO PART OF

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:36.232
MY DISTRICT WHICH IS HUGE AND

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:41.871
OPEN A LOT OF WAYS AND SO THAT'S

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:44.007
BEEN ONE OF MY MAIN.

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:45.341
PROBLEMS THAT WE BECOME SO

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:46.643
STATIC AND WHAT WE DO THAT WE

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:48.278
DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING OUT OF

00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:49.312
BOXES GOOD TO HEAR YEAH WE WANT

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:50.880
TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.716
AND GO OVER THERE.

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:56.286
OKAY CENTER I'M BURKE AND AND SO

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:57.053
ON AND AND I REALIZE A SOUND

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:57.687
LIKE A BIT OF A BROKEN RECORD

00:55:57.754 --> 00:55:58.955
BUT YOU MENTIONED THE MEDIA

00:55:59.022 --> 00:55:59.322
STRATEGY.

00:55:59.389 --> 00:55:59.989
SO CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF

00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:01.257
THE METRICS IN THE PERFORMANCE

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:03.493
MEASURES THAT WILL BE LOOKING

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.360
FORWARD.

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:06.029
TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF THE

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:07.997
MEDIA STRATEGY.

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:09.666
THOUGH BECAUSE IT'S OUT TO BID

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:11.768
RIGHT NOW I'D RATHER NOT COMMENT

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:14.370
ON THAT -- BUT I THINK I'M NOT A

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:16.372
MEDIA SPECIALIST BUT I WOULD

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:18.374
ASSUME IMPRESSIONS LOOKING AT

00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:20.610
WHERE THEY'RE PUTTING OUT THERE --

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:22.479
ADVERTISING AFTER USING SOCIAL

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:25.215
MEDIA CERTAINLY HAS REALLY GREAT --

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:27.650
YOU KNOW MEASUREMENTS -- BUT THE

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:29.319
MEASUREMENTS WERE USING IN TERMS

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:31.654
OF LIKE IN PERSON -- IS MORE

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:33.623
LIKE THE SORT OF PD I AB OF

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.225
KNOWING WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:36.693
SO ON MEDIA I'M GOING TO KIND OF

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.794
HOLD OFF ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:39.395
WE MIGHT BE DOING A A MEETING

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:41.364
HER WILL HAVE MUCH MORE --

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:43.666
BACKGROUND ON WHAT THE NEW TOOLS

00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:47.137
ARE IN TERMS OF MEASURING -- GET

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:47.837
A RADIO [inaudible]

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:49.239
PAPER.

00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:51.207
SOCIAL MEDIA SO WHEN WHEN WE DO

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:53.143
THE R. F. P. ARE WE ASKING THE

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:56.112
RESPONDENTS TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:57.447
WHICH IS OKAY THEIR OWN METRICS

00:56:57.514 --> 00:56:58.882
AN ORAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN

00:56:58.948 --> 00:56:59.849
THEIR OWN.

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:01.251
WHAT WHATEVER?

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:04.120
ANALYSES OF OF EFFICACY OR WE

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:06.756
PROVIDING THEM WE WANT TO SEE

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:08.892
YOU DO THE FOLLOWING HOW'S THAT

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:10.460
WORKING.

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:11.094
I MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RP

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:13.429
CLOSELY WASN'T ON THAT ONE BUT I

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:15.999
MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT LIKE A

00:57:16.065 --> 00:57:18.268
ELECTION WE 1100%.

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:20.770
SO BELOW I WILL HAT JUST I JUST

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:22.205
ASKED THAT QUESTION EVERY TIME

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:24.674
WE COME TO THE SUBJECT IS HOW DO

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:25.842
WE MEASURE.

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:26.543
WHAT ARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:28.645
WHAT OUR METRICS HOW DO WE

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:29.979
FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY WERE BEING

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:32.248
EFFICIENT SELF SO ARMY WITH ITS

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:33.082
WITH VOTERS WITH THE LOW

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:33.950
PREVENTS THE VOTERS HOW MANY

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:35.084
TIMES YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM FIVE

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:36.052
TIMES RATE?

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:37.187
BUT WE DON'T KNOW IS BECAUSE

00:57:37.253 --> 00:57:38.388
THIS HAPPENS EVERY TEN YEARS AND

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:39.522
WE DIDN'T COLLECT THIS TYPE OF

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:40.957
DATA IN TWENTY TEN IS.

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:42.625
HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO TOUCH

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:44.561
A VERY HARD TO COUNT PERSON THE

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:45.361
HAS ALL THESE DIFFERENT

00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:46.696
VARIABLES RATE?

00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:48.665
CAPS OF THREE TIMES FIVE TIMES

00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:50.366
TEN TIMES SO THAT'S THE TYPE OF

00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:52.368
THING IS WE DON'T HAVE.

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:55.071
DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN OR

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:55.705
TWO THOUSAND THAT SHOWS THAT AND

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:56.706
I'M HOPING THAT.

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:57.907
WE'RE PUTTING THESE COLLECTIONS

00:57:57.974 --> 00:57:59.142
IN PLACE AND THAT OUR PARTNERS

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:00.443
WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE DATA

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:01.911
TO GIVE US SOME INDICATION.

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:03.613
THAT YOU KNOW IF WE HIT THIS

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.582
AREA SO MANY TIMES THAT MAYBE IT

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:06.950
INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

00:58:07.016 --> 00:58:08.885
THEY RESPONDED AND WE'LL SEE THE

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:09.485
RESPONSE RATE FROM THE CENSUS

00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:14.290
BUREAU BUT WITHOUT THAT SORT OF

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:14.557

THAT CAME TO MIND ALL OF A

00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:26.870
SUDDEN WAS THAT WE HAVE MANY

00:58:26.936 --> 00:58:28.071
PEOPLE THEIR LIVES ILLITERATE.

00:58:28.137 --> 00:58:29.772

GOING TO TOUCH THOSE.

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:33.943
I LEARNED THIS THE HARD WAY

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:35.245
WORKING WITH HOUSING AUTHORITIES

EVEN READ.

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:44.654
ENGLISH OR IN THEIR OWN NATIVE

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:47.223

WORKING ON AND I KNOW THAT'S A

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:53.363
CHALLENGE BUT SO FOR SOME OF THE

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:54.797
INFOGRAPHICS I MEAN ARE ARE THE

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:56.532

ONE IT'S NOT AS MUCH A QUESTION

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:48.718
AS IT IS A CONCERN -- THAT AS

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:50.987
YOU DO THE MEDIA PLAN IN

00:59:51.054 --> 00:59:54.223
PARTICULAR -- I THINK -- IT'S

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:55.892
SAFE TO SAY THEY'LL PROBABLY BE

00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:57.560
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:59.295
SOMEWHERE.

00:59:59.362 --> 01:00:02.031
IN THAT -- OF INVESTED BY THE

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:05.835
STATE -- AND AS WE LOOK TO

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.570
LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.272
ACCESS ESPECIALLY.

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:11.841
REALLY OUR MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:13.543
IN THE HARD TO COUNT.

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:16.279
OF BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:17.580
YOU'RE RIGHT HOW MANY --

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.015
EVERYONE ELSE WILL NEED HOW MANY

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:22.118
REMINDERS BUT THE HARD TO COUNT

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:24.387
IS OUR DIFFICULTY AND LA COUNTY

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.656
HAS THE LARGEST HARD TO COUNT.

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.758
AND NOT TO MENTION THE HEART

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:30.927
THAT TRANSLATES INTO THE HIGHEST

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.562
NUMBERS OF HARD TO COME.

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:36.165
BUT SPECIFICALLY WITH THE MEDIA --

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:37.300
I JUST WANT.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.768
TO RAISE MY CONCERN THAT I'VE

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.003
SEEN.

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:44.007
IN VARIOUS VENUES AND PROGRAMS --

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:46.376
THAT THE MONEY GOES [inaudible]

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:50.079
TO ONE SORT OF COMPANY OR

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:52.148
SOMEBODY IN CHARGE OF THAT. TO

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:54.283
DOLE IT OUT -- AND THAT'S WHY I

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:57.587
THINK WE LOSE -- THAT MONEY

01:00:57.653 --> 01:01:00.456
GOING TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT.

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:02.925
MOST NEED IT AND IT'S KIND OF

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.928
SIMILAR TO SENATOR UMBERG IS IF

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:08.131
WE'RE NOT CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.499
EXPECT FROM THEM.

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:11.300
AND I KNOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:12.602
MUCH ON YOUR PLATE.

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:15.338
THAT -- YOU WOULDN'T GET INTO

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:16.139
THE WEEDS.

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:18.107
OF IT ARE BUT I THINK THAT'S

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.909
WHERE WE LOSE IT AND THAT'S

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:21.811
WHERE WE'VE HAD LOTS OF PROBLEMS

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.146
IS.

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:24.614
THAT THAT REALLY THAT THE

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.583
RESOURCES REALLY DON'T GET DOWN.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:33.256
INTO THOSE -- LOW RESOURCE OR NO

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:35.644
HISTORIC MOMENT IN CALIFORNIA.

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:37.913
AND ONE OF THOSE WAYS IS WHAT

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.482
WE'RE SEEING IS THE HUMANITARIAN

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:42.251
CRISIS AT OUR STATE'S BORDERS.

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:44.220
SO WE HAVE A LARGE INFLUX OF

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:46.088
REFUGEES ARE COMING TO

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:48.357
CALIFORNIA AND IF THEY'RE HERE

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.960
APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THEY

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:51.894
SHOULD BE COUNTED.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.596
AND THEY SHOULD BE COUNTED AND

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.531
OUTREACH TO IN THEIR LANGUAGE --

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.266
AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT TO THE

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:59.468
STATE CENSUS OFFICE WORK WITH

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:00.102
OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:01.003
SERVICES.

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:02.771
THAT HAS A NEW COMERS PROGRAM

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:05.374
THAT HAS DATA REGARDING WHAT

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:06.008
THOSE LANGUAGES ARE [inaudible]

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:09.144
AND YOU KNOW I'M I'M HAPPY TO

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:10.646
SEE THAT THE PLAN WILL BE OUT ON

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:11.981
THE SEVENTEENTH.

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:13.449
SO WE COULD GIVE FURTHER

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:16.151
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ONE OF THE

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:19.622
THINGS THAT I THINK IS -- IS

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.624
NEEDED IS WHILE [inaudible]

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:28.030
ARE A THEY RECOGNIZE THAT WE THE

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:29.932
FEEDBACK IN TEAMS WAS A TO

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.101
TRANSITION FROM STANDARDS TO AN

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.969
OPERATIONAL PLAN.

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:34.737
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:37.339
SEE THAT THANK YOU IN.

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.508
IN THE M. MAY SEVENTEENTH AND SO

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:40.743
SOME OF THE THINGS WE'D LIKE TO

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:42.311
SEE IS WHICH LANGUAGE GROUPS

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:44.613
WILL BE TARGETED THE AMOUNT THAT

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.215
WILL BE SPENT ON THAT LANGUAGE

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:47.449
OF THOSE LANGUAGE GROUPS.

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.451
AND THE RECOMMENDED AND APPROVED

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:49.985
METHODS FOR REACHING THESE

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:51.787
GROUPS THE PLAN SHOULD STATE

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.422
WHAT QUALIFIES AS A LANGUAGE

01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:55.858
ACCESS EXPENSE AND THERE MUST BE

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:57.560
A MECHANISM FOR PARTNERS ALL THE

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.194
STATE PARTNERS TO TRACK AND

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:00.162
REFLECT.

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:01.730
HOW THEY ARE SPENDING THOSE

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.399
DOLLARS IN EACH GROUP I THINK IT

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.201
GETS TO THE ISSUE OF METRICS AND

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:06.669
COUNTING AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:09.171
THERE'S TRANSPARENCY AND -- THAT

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:10.439
THESE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO WHERE

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:12.107
THEY NEED AND THAT THE GAPS ARE

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:14.076

ONE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:31.113
CURRENTLY.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.181
THIS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT GIVEN

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.148
THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING LANGUAGE

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:34.349
ACCESS AS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:35.684
KEY ASPECTS OF THE CENSUS IS

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:36.885
THAT THE PLAN IN REGARDS TO

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.454
LANGUAGE ACCESS. TO THAT IN.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.655

MAKE SURE THAT.

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:41.690

TRADITIONAL FOR FOR US IMMIGRANT

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:45.728
A REPUBLICAN ESPECIALLY THE

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:47.563
CENTER VALLEY WE SEE A NUMBER OF

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:48.964
LOW LITERACY IMMIGRANTS WHO WHAT

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.032
THEY THERE'S A STEAK MASSIVE

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:50.699
RELATES TO WHETHER NOT THEY COME

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:51.300
OUT AND SAY LIKE I DON'T KNOW

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:51.633
HOW TO READ.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:52.468
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.403
AND SO THEREFORE WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.572
SURE THAT THERE'S A PLAN AB FOUR

01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:57.506
DOES STOP FOR DOES LANGUAGES

ESPECIALLY THAT ACCOUNT -- FOR

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.009
FOR FOR INCLUDING A PADDLING

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:04.079
WHICH IS ARE NOT TRADITIONAL --

01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:06.081
I'M IN ADDITION TO THAT.

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:08.817
WE ATTENDED I SEE YOUR LIST OF

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.018
WHAT ATTENDED THE AB COMPLETE

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:11.520
CAM COMEDIAN WHICH THE DRAFT ON

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:13.155
LANGUAGE ACCESS WAS RELEASED.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.223
I WOULDPROVIDE SOME SOME INPUT

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.091
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:18.360
THE PLAN AS I GET ALLOWING

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:18.927
MYSELF WITH -- MY COLLEAGUE

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:19.928
SUMMONS THAT WE NEED MORE

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:21.263
DETAILS IN REGARDS TO THE

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.498
IMPLEMENTATION AND MORE

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:25.267
MEASURABLE OUTCOMES -- WE ALSO

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:26.368
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LANGUAGE

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:28.270
ACCESS PLANS A FILL THE GAP I'M

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.438
AT THE STATE BUT THAT ALSO AT

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:30.873
THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR EXAMPLE HOW

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:31.940
TO ADDRESS.

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.642
THE NEEDS OF IMMIGRANTS AGAIN

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.644
THAT SPEAK ENGLISH -- BY THEY

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:36.879
SPEAK A DIALECT -- IN THESE

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:38.514
CASES THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.415
FURTHERMORE WE ALSO URGE THE

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:41.283
STATE.

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:42.017
I DO HAVE A PLAN THAT IS

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.119
FLEXIBLE TO COVER ANY LANGUAGES

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:45.821
ANY OTHER LANGUAGE OR DIALECT

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:47.723
WHOSE POPULATION MIGHT BE LOWER

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.424
BUT ELLIE P. MIGHT BE HIGHER AND

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:50.893
SO THAT THAT THAT THAT GOES INTO

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:52.027
THE SHOULD THE TRIGGER.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.562
THAT IT HAS TO BE FLEXIBE ANY

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:55.497
AND HAS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:56.765
FOR SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES.

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.700
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE -- THAT

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:00.669
AGAIN THAT ANY PLAN CONSIDERS

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.938
NOT RE LANGUAGES INCLUDING

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:04.239
DIALECTS AND A PM LANGUAGES --

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:06.108
IMMIGRANTS COME FROM DIFFERENT

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.009
BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:10.179
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND WE

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:11.747
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:12.848
THEM WHO ARE LOW LITERACY IS THE

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:13.849
QUESTION BECOMES WHAT IS THE

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:14.716
PLAN FOR THEM AS WELL.

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:26.595
IN REGARDS -- TO LANGUAGE ACCESS.

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.463
LASTLY WE MIGHT HAVE A PERFECT

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:29.464
PLAN OUT BUT HE CANNOT BE

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:30.899
IMPLEMENTED EITHER AT THE READ

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:31.700
THE RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:32.801
ALLOCATED SO FOR US WE WANT TO

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:33.902
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.637
FUNDING FOR STATEWIDE A REGIONAL

01:14:35.704 --> 01:14:36.705
A CBO'S TO CARRY OUT.

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.307
THEIR LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION --

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:40.209
ACCESS PLAN WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:42.945
SURE THAT -- AC AB A CBO'S ARE

01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:43.745

ESSENTIALLY -- THE VICE MUCH

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.269
SMALLER GROUPS IN TERMS OF IN

NEED TO REACH OUT TO THEM I MEAN

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:49.978
I THINK CONCEPTUALLY WE ALL

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:50.445
AGREE.

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.014
HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT DOING

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.282
THAT HOW WOULD YOU PROPOSE GOING

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:54.249
ABOUT DOING IT WHAT KIND OF

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.784
THING SHOULD BE REQUIRING COUNTY

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:58.520
USERS THE CBO'S TO BE DOING OR

01:15:58.587 --> 01:15:59.154
WHAT ARE HOW WOULD YOU THIS IT

01:15:59.221 --> 01:15:59.655

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.959
YOU TELL THEM.

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.394
WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.329
WITH STAFF AND WE APPRECIATE

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.731
THEIR TIME AND EFFORT AND I DO

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:11.266
BELIEVE THE STATE CENSUS OUT

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.702
REACH STAFF -- ARE AWARE OF THE

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:15.971
SAME CHALLENGES AND I THINK ONE

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.773
OF THE WAYS THAT YOU GO ABOUT IT

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.841
IS ACTUALLY -- IS TO HAVE A

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.810
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS -- I DON'T

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:24.046
KNOW IF STATE CENSUS HAS BROUGHT

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:25.981
FOLKS TOGETHER FOR THOSE KINDS

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:28.216
OF MEETINGS AND FOR THOSE KINDS

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:30.919
OF ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED.

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.821
WELL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.656
KNOW WHO ARE THE GROUPS THAT

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.425
WORK WITH THE INDIGENOUS

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:37.759
COMMUNITIES.

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:39.594
UP IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:41.229
WHAT THOSE LANGUAGES ARE WHAT

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:42.698
ARE THE BEST WAYS TO REACH THEM

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:43.899
SOME OF A MERE HERE AND YOU'LL

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:46.101
HEAR FROM THEM -- WE HAVE SEE

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.569
RACH HERE WHO WORKS WITH THE

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:49.204
SOUTHEAST ASIAN COMMUNITIES AND

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.873
THEY CAN SPEAK TO THOSE --

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.041
COMMUNITIES AND WHAT THOSE NEEDS

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.142
ARE.

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:55.844
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HIDDEN WE KNOW

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:57.713
THAT THE PACIFIC ISLANDER

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:59.481
COMMUNITY THERE ARE NO.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:00.816
THERE ARE NO LANGUAGE SUPPORTS

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:03.485
SO THESE ARE KNOWN ISSUES AND

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:05.354
KNOWN CHALLENGES AND I THINK IT

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.788
REALLY ACTUALLY INVOLVES A

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:08.490
CONVERSATION WITH THOSE

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.892
COMMUNITIES ABOUT WHAT THOSE

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:11.827
LANGUAGE ACCESS.

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:14.129
BARRIERS ARE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:16.698
IMPORTANT TO MAYBE IT ISN'T A

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:17.899
TRIGGER MAYBE TO TRIGGER WITH

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.468
THE BIGGER -- ELLIE P.

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:22.404
COMMUNITIES AND MAYBE IT'S JUST.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:23.905
WILL COUNT EVERYBODY IN THIS

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:26.375
POPULATION MAYBE IT'S LOOKING AT

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:28.477
THINGS IN IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.312
SINCE BEEN HAVING A BIFURCATED

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.014
PLAN FOR THE BIGGER LET ELLIE P.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.382
COMMUNITIES AND THEN THE MUCH

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:34.483
SMALLER ONES.

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:39.121
SO -- THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.889
THAT YOU THINK ABOUT.

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:43.725
OKAY WELL LET'S SEE.

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.160
SO -- HERE BY HER TO STAKEHOLDER

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:46.795
PROCESS WHICH IS GREAT BUT I'M

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:49.498
NOT HEARING SPECIFIC APPROACH TO

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.500
HOW ARE.

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:52.968
AND AND I GUESS OKAY LIKE THOSE

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.036
OTHER QUESTION THEN.

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:55.370
NO CALIFORNIA VERY BIG STATE --

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:57.339
YOU KNOW LA COUNTY ALONE IS

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.441
BIGGER THAN MOST OTHERS THAN

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.878
MOST OF THE STATE AND THE REST

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:03.245
OF THE COUNTRY.

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:04.980
ALONE.

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.948
YEAH RIGHT YEAH LARGER FORTY TWO

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:08.517
OTHER STATES SO YOU WOULD TAKE

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:12.120
LA OUT RIGHT -- SO IS THIS

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:13.055
SOMETHING WE SAY STAKEHOLDER

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:14.656
PROCESS IS A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:16.358
TAKES PLACE AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:17.826
WHICH COURSE WE HAVE A VERY

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:19.895
LARGE STATE OR IS THIS SOMETHING

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:21.763
WE HAVE REGIONAL A CBO'S IS A

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.231
SOMETHING WE EXPECT THE A CBO TO

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:24.499
DO SO THAT WE GET.

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:25.467
NOW AND EVEN SOME OF THE CEOS

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.135
ARE COVERING MULTIPLE COUNTIES

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:28.103
AND SO FORTH.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:31.239
SO WHAT WHAT I MEAN TERMS OF

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:34.342
YOUR EXPECTATION ABOUT IS THIS --

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:35.544
IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE REACH

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.546
THESE MUCH SMALLER BECAUSE WE

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:38.413
START TALKING ABOUT PARTICULAR

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.382
OR LANGUAGES IN THE CENTRAL

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:41.550
VALLEY PERHAPS MAYBE IT'S THE A%

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:42.751
CBO WHOSE FOCUSING ON THE

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:44.319
CENTRAL VALLEY THAT SHOULD BE

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.388
DOING THIS.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.024
PURSES -- SO THE DAY.

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:50.192
WAY YOU PROPOSED WHAT DO YOU

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:50.592
SUGGEST.

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:53.295
WELL WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE DRAFT

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:54.763
LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN.

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:55.964
THEY HAD STATEWIDE CBO'S ON THE

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.799
ROOF -- RESPONSIBLE FOR SPANISH

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:58.834
AND ENGLISH THEY HAD THE

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.470
REGIONALS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:03.205
SIX LANGUAGES THEY HAD COUNTIES

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.639
MAKING A REASONABLE EFFORT.

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:06.441
I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:10.378
COHESIVENESS ABOUT WHO IS

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:11.580
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT.

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:12.981
WHO WHAT ARE THE TARGETED

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:14.583
LANGUAGES YOU HAVE THE STATE

01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:17.119
PARTNERS?

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.987
HAVE THEM DETERMINE WHERE HAVE

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:20.055
THE SENSE STATE CENSUS MY

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:21.423
DETERMINE.

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:22.958
ARE THE REGION'S THE BETTER ONES

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.259
ARE THE COUNTIES THE BETTER ONES

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:26.161
ARE THE STATE WIDE CBO IS YOU

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:28.296
HAVE PARTNERS USE THEM AND AND

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:32.167
HAVE THERE BE SOME -- COHESION.

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:34.169
IDENTIFY THE LANGUAGES IDENTIFY

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:35.704
THE LANGUAGE GROUPS AND AND GO

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.640
FROM THERE [inaudible]

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:40.509
YES.

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.277
SUBSIDY FOR US IS BOTH FRIDAY IS

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.545
MAKING SURE MILLION ALIGN MYSELF

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:44.579
WITH MY COLLEAGUE GETTING SOME

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.982
OF THE COMMENTS BUT I THINK ALSO

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:48.617
IS VERY REGIONAL AS SERIOUS AS

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:50.852
THE A CBL HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:51.653
OF A GUIDE AS AS HE RELATES TO

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:51.853
THAT.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.787
BUT MORE IMPORTANT HAVE TO HAVE

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:54.456
SOME RESOURCES THAN IMPLEMENT

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:55.790
SOME OF THE SOME OF THAT THAT

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:58.093
THOSE REQUIREMENTS.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.828
I DO FOR US WE KNOW.

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:01.596
WE KEEP THAT THERE WAS THAT A

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:02.397
SOME.

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.432
I CLEAR EXPECTATIONS RELATES TO

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:05.700
WHAT A CBO WHO IS GOOD AT DOING

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:06.801
HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE CANADIAN

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:07.636
WITH A STATEWIDE PARTNERS A

01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:10.205
CIVILIZED LANGUAGE ACCESS.

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:11.239
THAT PLAN ARE GOING TO COME.

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:12.641
YOU KNOW COME BACK IN THE FUTURE

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.075
AND THAT IS GOING TO DETERMINE A

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:15.410
LITTLE BIT HOW TO BE CORNY BUT I

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:16.778
DO YOU FOR US THE IMPORTANT

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:17.913
ASPECT OF EIGHTIES.

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:21.183
HAVE CLEAR -- GUIDANCE FROM A

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:24.252
STATE PLAN IN RELAYED THAT TO A

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.787
CBO IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:27.189
REGIONALLY BUT THAT'S HOW IS

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:28.757
THAT GOING -- TO COMPLEMENT THIS

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:30.525
THEY WORK SETTING THE FACT THAT

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:32.060
THE FIRST RAP HAD A LOT OF WE

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:33.461
HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:35.997
IT DID NOT ALLOW US TO DO

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:37.766
ESSENTIALLY COME A WITH A WITH

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:38.733
THE RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:46.208
THERE WAS NOTHING TO PROVIDE

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:47.075
RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:48.410
TO IN SOME ASPECTS.

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:49.711
OKAY.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:52.180
SO -- SO I SEE DIRECTOR HERE I

01:20:52.247 --> 01:20:53.114
GUESS WHEN YOU REFLECT SOUNDS

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:53.949
SOUNDS LIKE I'M HEARING A LOT OF

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:55.350
WE NEED CLEAR DIRECTION WHO'S

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:57.419
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT -- AT AND

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:58.520
WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:02.457
DOING AT SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:03.425
THAT SOUNDS LIKE AND THEN I

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:06.461
GUESS. ONE HEARING FROM YOUR

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.063
PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST THE DRAFT

THE WITH THE STATE LAST MONTH

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.536
THAT -- WE WERE LOOKING -- TO

01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:58.138
COMPREHENSIVE BY THE NEXT

01:42:58.205 --> 01:43:01.842
QUARTERLY REPORT ON JULY FIRST --

01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:03.110
BECAUSE THAT WOULD GIVE US A

01:43:03.176 --> 01:43:04.478
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO GO

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:06.346
THROUGH THESE PROCESS SEES AND

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:07.881
BAD.

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:10.884
A LANGUAGE ACCESS HEY AND SO --

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:12.619
I GUESS -- DIRECTOR CRAFTING

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:13.687
COMMON WHEN SHE DOES A

01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:15.289
REFLECTION ON DOES THAT CHANGE

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:18.058
THE TIMELINE FOR ALL THE OTHER

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:21.161
THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT -- SO.

01:43:21.228 --> 01:43:22.162
SHE'S SHAKING HER HEAD SO I

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.696
THINK THAT'S A PRELIMINARY

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:25.332
ANSWER -- SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:26.433
PART.

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.635
YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT WE NEED

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:30.270
FIVE MILLION MORE -- I WOULD

01:43:30.337 --> 01:43:31.371
POINT OUT THAT WE'VE THIS IS A

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:33.640
HISTORIC LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:34.274
THE CENSUS I MEAN WHAT I DON'T

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:35.876
THINK THE CITY CALIFORNIA THE

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:37.945
STATE GOVERNMENT'S EVER PUT IN --

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:38.946
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE HAVE WE'RE

01:43:39.012 --> 01:43:40.247
PLANNING TO BUT WE VERY BALLOT

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:41.481
HERE HUNDRED MILLION WERE.

01:43:41.548 --> 01:43:43.450
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ANOTHER

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:45.852
FIFTY FOUR MILLION THAT'S A LOT

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:47.254
OF MONEY.

01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:47.888
AND THEN YOU'RE COMING BACK AND

01:43:47.955 --> 01:43:48.956
SAYING I NEED FIVE MILLION MORE

01:43:49.022 --> 01:43:51.491
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS SPEND THE

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:53.293
FIVE MILLION MORE ON THAT.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:53.927
AND THEN WE WHAT WE REALLOCATED

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:56.396
WHAT NINE MILLION TO LA COUNTY

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:57.497
SO.

01:43:57.564 --> 01:43:59.533
I REALIZE IT'S A VERY BIG COUNTY --

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.735
BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT TAXES

01:44:01.802 --> 01:44:03.971
I THINK IS ALLOCATED ZERO NEW

01:44:04.037 --> 01:44:05.539
YORK IS ALLOCATED TO MILLION.

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:07.341
SO I MEAN THOSE ARE BIG STATES

01:44:07.407 --> 01:44:08.842
AND I REALIZE THAT WE SINCE

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:11.912
WE'RE COMPARING LA TO STATES SO

01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:15.182
WE'RE GIVING YOU NINE MILLION.

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:15.716
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH -- YOU

01:44:15.782 --> 01:44:17.217
REQUESTED TWELVE MILLION LAST

01:44:17.284 --> 01:44:19.286
OKAY WHICH YOU GAVE US NINE FOUR

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:20.787
WHICH IS CRACK SO THERE'S THE

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:22.289
TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR GAP

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:23.023
THERE.

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.325
AND THAT CAP DID DRESS LANGUAGE

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:27.260
ACCESS SPECIFICALLY -- IN

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:28.996
ADDITION THOUGH THIS STATE IS

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:30.998
ADDED SOME NEW REQUIREMENTS ONE

01:44:31.064 --> 01:44:34.001
BEING THEY'RE ASKING US TO HELP

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.802
THE US CENSUS BUREAU WITH

01:44:35.869 --> 01:44:38.472
RECRUITMENT FOR ENUMERATORS WE

01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:39.873
HAD TO ASSUME THAT THAT WAS THE

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:42.075
U. S. CENSUS BUREAU'S ROLE.

01:44:42.142 --> 01:44:44.611
AND WE WERE NOT ANTICIPATING

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:47.748
BECOMING A JOB RECRUITMENT --

01:44:47.814 --> 01:44:50.784
EFFORT FOR THE US CENSUS BUREAU

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:54.321
WE HAVE BEGUN LOOKING AT HOW WE

01:44:54.388 --> 01:44:55.756
ARE GOING TO DO THAT WE HAVE

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:57.491
PULLED TOGETHER OUR DEPARTMENTS

01:44:57.557 --> 01:44:59.960
THAT DO YOU -- SINCE SUCH AS OUR

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:01.561
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OUR

01:45:01.628 --> 01:45:02.829
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:03.897
SERVICES PEOPLE THAT WERE

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:05.766
WAITING CLIENTS.

01:45:05.832 --> 01:45:08.368
AND FOLKS IN OUR COUNTY WOULD

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:10.804
POTENTIALLY BE ENUMERATORS BUT

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:13.440
IN ORDER TO DO -- A ROBUST

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:14.941
EFFORT AROUND ENUMERATOR

01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:16.943
RECRUITMENT THAT WILL REQUIRE

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:19.046
RESOURCES SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN

01:45:19.112 --> 01:45:20.480
IDEA IN.

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:23.050
TWENTY TEN THERE WERE ELEVEN

01:45:23.116 --> 01:45:23.517
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:24.685
ENUMERATORS FOR LOS ANGELES

01:45:24.751 --> 01:45:25.686
COUNTY.

01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:27.487
AND THAT WAS IN THE YEAR WHERE

01:45:27.554 --> 01:45:30.190
THERE WAS A LOT MORE

01:45:30.257 --> 01:45:31.258
UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:32.893
WHERE RECRUITMENT WAS A LOT

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:35.362
EASIER -- THEN WHAT WILL FACE

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:37.964
GOING FORWARD IN THIS EFFORT.

01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:39.833
SO THAT'S ONE BIG AREA THAT WE

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.468
NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:43.637
GOING TO MOBILIZE AROUND.

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:44.905
THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISCUSSION

01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:46.339
ABOUT THE NATIVE AMERICAN

01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:49.109
COMMUNITY WHICH IS LA COUNTY HAS.

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:50.811
AMONGST THE LARGEST OF THE

01:45:50.877 --> 01:45:52.579
LARGEST ALSO WHO ONE OF THE

01:45:52.646 --> 01:45:54.514
LARGEST NATIVE AMERICAN

01:45:54.581 --> 01:45:55.916
COMMUNITIES LA CITY.

01:45:55.982 --> 01:45:58.218
ALONE IS THE SECOND LARGEST IN

IT'S A HUGE POTENTIAL -- POINT --

01:50:09.869 --> 01:50:11.204
TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND THIS COULD

01:50:11.271 --> 01:50:12.772
