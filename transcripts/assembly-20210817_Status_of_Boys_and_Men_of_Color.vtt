00:29:44.983 --> 00:29:46.284
I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE

00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:47.452
COMMUNITY BALLOT INITIATIVE

GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:51.856
ORGANIZATION AND- BUT BASICALLY

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:53.591
IT'S PARTIALLY- CALIFORNIA BUT

00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:54.459
WORKING IN THE STATE FOR MANY

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:56.294
YEARS. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT

00:29:56.361 --> 00:29:57.595
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:29:57.662 --> 00:29:58.863
HOMICIDES AND SHOOTINGS

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.565
AMERICA'S GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.367
HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:03.735
AS YOU WERE SAYING ON YOUNG MEN

00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:05.503
AND BOYS OF COLOR- BUT YOU

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.972
OFTEN ARE POLICY CONVERSATIONS

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:08.973
AND SOLUTIONS FAILED TO REFLECT

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.510
THAT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA 75% OF

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:14.679
HOMICIDE VICTIMS ARE BLACK IN

00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:16.781
LATIN NEXT PEOPLE WITH MOST AS

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:18.449
YOU SPEND BEING MALE AND

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:19.717
HOMICIDE IS IN FACT THE LEADING

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:21.286
CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG BLACK

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:23.021
MEN IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:24.856
THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH FOR

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:26.991
YOUNG LATINO MEN AND FOR EXTRA

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:28.826
CONTEXT NEARLY AS MANY

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:30.428
CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR LIVES

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:32.597
JUST LAST YEAR. AS U. S.

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:34.566
SOLDIERS DEAD- DURING THE

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:36.134
ENTIRE CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:37.702
OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES SO

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:38.870
COMMUNITY VIOLENCE IS AN

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:41.005
INCREDIBLY PRESSING DAILY ISSUE

00:30:41.072 --> 00:30:42.006
INOUR STATE AND WE REALLY

AND WHAT THE STATE CAN DO

00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:48.046
BETTER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:49.547
AS YOU SAID WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:51.115
HOMICIDE IN BOUNCING CALIFORNIA

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.218
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT GUNS

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:55.353
THREE QUARTERS OF HOMICIDES IN

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.387
THE STATE ARE COMMITTED WITH A

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:58.790
GUN AND CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER

00:30:58.856 --> 00:30:59.857
WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:01.459
ACCESS TO GUNS AND GUN SAFETY

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:02.927
LAWS I'VE BEEN THERE A FEW

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.495
OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT WE CANNOT

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:05.997
IGNORE AT THE SAME TIME THE

00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:08.032

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:10.902
INEQUALITY THAT HAS LED TO

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:11.970
DISPROPORTIONATE LEVELS OF

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.671
POVERTY INCARCERATION AND

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:15.807
DIVESTMENT YOU MAYES OF COLOR.

00:31:15.873 --> 00:31:18.376
AND THE SECOND MORE CONCRETE

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:20.211
GEN JUST AS IMPORTANT IS

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:21.279
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:23.481
VIOLENCE IS BOTH A SYMPTOM AND

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:24.849
AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF MANY

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:25.950
QUALITY WE HAVE TO

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:27.118
INTENTIONALLY INVEST IN

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.953
COMMUNITY LED AN EVIDENCE BASED

CALIFORNIA- THE INCREASE IN THE

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:13.211
FUNDING ALLOWS US ROOT FOR IT

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:15.780
FOR INSTANCE A SITUATION LIKE

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:32.563
THEY EVER HAVE ONE YEAR. WITH

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.331
NO JOB AND NOW I'M- THIS

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:36.234

PANDEMIC AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:58.322

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:00.258
THE DISINVESTMENT BUT THEY'RE

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:01.993

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.456
DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN AND

INDEPENDENT LAWMAKERS AT THE

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.625
STATE LEGISLATURE SO WE ARE

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.561
VERY EXCITED. AND WILLING TO

00:51:37.627 --> 00:51:39.696
OFFER- THESE KIND OF THE-

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:41.164
TALKING POINTS ARGUMENTS AND

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:42.699
STUDY SO YOU WALKING NUMBER

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:44.901

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:53.376
WOULD SAY TO YOU- THESE NUMBERS

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:55.779
PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE KIND

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:57.714
OF LIVES THAT WE ARE LITERALLY

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.382
KEEPING ALIVE AND FREE TO

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:00.350
STABILIZE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:02.185
COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES. AND

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:04.788
SO THE PRICELESS NATURE OF A

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:07.858
LIFE- CERTAINLY IS OUR VALUES

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:10.527
THAT DRIVES. TO WORK THE FISCAL

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:11.795
RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S BEING

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:16.500
ASKED OF US WE WERE. TALKING

00:52:16.566 --> 00:52:17.033
ABOUT THE USE OF TAXPAYER

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.935
DOLLARS. THANK YOU TO READING

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:21.705
COMES FOR IN A OTHER. I WOULD

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:22.672
JUST BRIEFLY ADD ON IN THAT

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.140
THAT THEY COUNTED COALITION HAS

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:25.575
BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.077
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I'M

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:28.612
EXCITED TO SEE WHAT'S GOING TO

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:30.113
COME FROM ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.481
BEING ALLOCATED TO COMBAT PART

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:36.686
OF THE. SB SEC WHICH

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:38.421
ADMINISTERS COMMENT THE ABILITY

00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:39.823
NOW TO CONTRACT WITH A THIRD

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.558
PARTY RESEARCHERS ARE GETTING

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.393
DATA COLLECTION AND TECHNICAL

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.095
ASSISTANCE AND EVALUATION OF

00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:46.229
THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM FOR

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:47.864
THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE NOT HAD

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.299
THE ABILITY TO DO THAT BEFORE

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:50.867
BECAUSE OF LACK OF RESOURCES

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.802
SO. THAT'S GONNA LET US SEE

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:54.337
MORE DATA THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN

00:52:54.404 --> 00:52:56.006
BEFORE HOW ABOUT GROUPS THAT

00:52:56.072 --> 00:52:57.173
ARE DOING THE WORK TO COLLECT

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.109
DATA AND MORE EFFICIENT WAY AND

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:00.243
I WOULD OUR WEEK I MEAN WE

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:01.711
ALREADY HAVE VERY IMPRESSIVE

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:02.846
RESULTS THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:04.414
THIS IS GOING TO FURTHER CEMENT

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:06.750
THAT- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE THE UC

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:08.184
BERKELEY STUDY I MENTIONED

00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:09.352
LOOKING AT ADVANCE PEACE IN

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:12.622
SACRAMENTO. SITE TWENTY TWO AND

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.891
39% DECREASES IN HOMICIDE- OVER

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:15.759
THE PRIOR ONE OR TWO YEAR

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.127
PERIOD IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:18.495
WHERE ADVANCED PIECES BEEN

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:20.330
ACTIVE NINE DOUBLE DIGIT

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:21.898
REDUCTIONS IN MANY DIFFERENT

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:23.967
CITIES WE LOOK AT A DIFFERENT-

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.002
AND THE WHOLE STATE AND SONIC

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:27.837
CALVET FUNDED CITIES SOME

00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:30.473
REDUCTIONS IN OVERALL HOMICIDES

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.175
THREE TIMES FASTER OR THREE

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.510
TIMES GREATER I SHOULD SAY THAN

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.712
NON CALVET FUNDED CITIES SO. WE

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:36.913
CAN SEE THAT THE PROGRAM AS A

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.448
WHOLE IT MAKE AN IMPACT AND I

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:40.984
THINK WITH THE NEW- THIRD PARTY

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:43.453
RESEARCH CONTRACT AND DEEPER

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.121
ABILITY TO DO EVALUATIONS WILL

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:48.024
HAVE EVEN MORE- VERY GRANULAR

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:49.759
IMPACT INFORMATION AVAILABLE SO

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.194
WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT WELL I

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:52.963
PASTOR MIGHT BE PASSED REGARD

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:55.098
WITH THING- THERE'S ALREADY A

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.499
VERY COMPELLING CASE TO BE MADE

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:58.635
POSSIBLE ANNOUNCES EXTREME. AND

00:53:58.702 --> 00:53:59.903
THERE'S VERY SPECIFIC STUDIES

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.771
ON THE COST SAVINGS- AND THE

00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:03.406
LIVES THAT ARE BEING STATE I'M

00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:10.814
IN CITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.916
THAT ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY.

00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:14.818
THANK YOU. MISTER CAR HAS A

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:17.587
QUESTION. THANK THANK YOU- AND

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:18.221
I REALLY APPRECIATE PEOPLE TO

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.623
THE TIME OF AND CREDIBLE THE

00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:21.091
SPEAKER AND ALL THREE PANELS SO

00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:22.425
HAPPY TO BE HERE AND TO LEARN

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:24.194
AND TO LISTEN AS WELL AS OFFER

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.196
SOME THOUGHTS. AND WHAT ONE OF

00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:27.430
THE THINGS I CAME UP WITH ALL

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:29.065
THE FOLKS IS SPOKEN AND I THINK

00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:31.267
THAT WE KNOW THAT HAVE SEEN

00:54:31.334 --> 00:54:32.535
SUCCESS IN SOME OF THESE

00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:33.570
PROGRAM APPROVAL CONCEPT IS

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:37.007
THERE BUT OF COURSE THE NEXT

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:37.607
QUESTION IS HOW MUCH THE COST

00:54:37.674 --> 00:54:38.608
WAS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. AND SO

00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:40.043
IT IN IN MY HOME TOWN IN SAN

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.746
JOSE- WE'VE BEEN TAKING A

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:43.913
LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:44.948
AGGRESSIVE STANCE ON THAT AS OF

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:47.117
LATE. ON A COUPLE FRONTS

00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:48.385
BECAUSE IN THE CITY IS SOUNDS A

00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:50.620
ALONE. IT'S ESTIMATED THE COST

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:52.555
OF. GUN VIOLENCE APPROXIMATELY

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:54.391
AS A PROXY FOUR HUNDRED FORTY

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:56.459
TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. A

00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:57.494
THIRTY FIVE MILLION OF WHICH IS

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.929
DIRECT. OUT OF POCKET COST.

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.297
SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION OR SO.

00:55:01.364 --> 00:55:05.201
LOST WORK. AND THREE HUNDRED

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:05.835
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION IN QUALITY

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:07.270
OF LIFE. SO ULTIMATELY WHO

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:08.571
SHOULD PAY FOR THAT NOW WHO

00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:09.572
WILL WHO WERE SHOULD NOT BURDEN

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:11.608
WHY. HE SHOULD BE ON EVERY

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:13.610
WONDERFUL TO BE SOME SENSE OF

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:16.546
RESPONSIBILITY. ON THOSE THAT-

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:18.081
HAVE GUNS AND EVEN IF THE

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:20.684
RESPONSE OWNERS I. HAVE AUTO

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.686
INSURANCE. AND MANY RESPONSIBLE

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:23.853
DRIVER THEY DON'T GET A TICKET

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.922
FIFTY YEARS. THEY PAY INTO THE

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:27.991
INSURANCE SYSTEM RIGHT. BECAUSE

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:29.325
AN ACCIDENT CAN HAPPEN EVEN IF

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:32.395
YOU'RE A GOOD DRIVER- AND SO.

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:33.263
ONE OF THE CONCEPTS BROUGHT

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:34.898
BOARD OVER THERE WAS ACTUALLY

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:35.465
APPROVED BY OUR CITY COUNCIL

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:37.967
WAS. OF IT IN TERMS OF REDUCING

00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:39.736
GUN HARM THROUGH AN INSURANCE

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:43.940
MANDATE IS REQUIRING. OWNERS TO

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:44.541
CARRY LIABILITY INSURANCE. ON

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:45.442
THE OTHER- REGARDING REDUCING

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:47.610
THE PUBLIC COSTA GUN VIOLENCE.

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:51.681
IS HAVING A FIFTY- TO COVER TAX

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:53.083
PER COSTS FOR EVERYONE THAT

00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:55.185
POSSESSES OR OWNS A GUN- IN OUR

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:58.088
CITY. AND SO THAT'S OF THOSE

00:55:58.154 --> 00:55:59.923
ARE A COUPLE BEHIND AND

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:00.523
THOUSANDS MORE THAN I WAS THE

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.959
FIRST CITY TO DO THAT- TO IS TO

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:04.360
HAVE BOTH THE INSURANCE MANDATE

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:06.262
AND THAT IS IN ADDITION. HAVE A

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:09.532
FEE. FOR OPEN GUN OWNERS AS ARE

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:10.767
ANY OF THE PANELISTS OF YOUR

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:11.735
THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE AGAIN

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.937
I WANT THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:15.238
RUNNING NEED TO BE FUNDED BY

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.140
SOMEONE AND SOMEHOW. AND I

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:18.308
THINK THAT THERE IS. WE'VE

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.977
SHOWN WITH AUTO INSURANCE THAT

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:22.779
THE ABILITY TO USE RISK

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.647
ADJUSTED PREMIUMS TO REWARD

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:27.083
GOOD DRIVING. AND INCENTIVIZE

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:28.885
USE OF SAFETY FEATURES AIRBAGS

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:30.754
WHAT HAVE YOU SOME ONLY YOU CAN

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.922
REWARD TAKING SAFETY CLASSES

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:33.890
USING GUNS SAVES A STALLING

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:35.425
TRIPPING ON AND ON AND ON COULD

00:56:35.492 --> 00:56:37.327
BE REWARDED. BY AN INSURANCE

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:39.395
CARRIER SOMEONE OPTS NOT TO DO

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:41.064
IT MAYBE THE PRIOR INSURANCE

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:42.632
BUT JUST THROWING THAT CONCEPT

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:44.834
OUT THERE TO SEE TO HELP FUND

00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:45.902
SOME OF THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:47.570
ALL ARE DOING AND OTHER. TYPES

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:53.710
OF PROGRAMS AND NEEDS. AS WE'RE

BEFORE YOU SPEAK MY- THAT WE

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:04.454

TAX. BE PLACED ON ON GUN SALES

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:09.793
AND THAT THAT MONEY WOULD BE GO

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:11.895
THAT MONEY WOULD BE A- GOOD FOR

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:14.030

TENDS TO BE AT A TIME OF

CRISIS. AT AN EMERGENCY ROOM A

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.479
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL OR DUE TO

SOME TYPE OF- INTERACTION WITH

LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WE'VE ALSO

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:42.518
SEEN THAT SINCE THE START OF

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:44.720
THIS PANDEMIC. YOUTH AND IN

CALLS TO CRISIS HOTLINE HAVE

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.633
INCREASED FOR EXAMPLE THE

NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:00.269
LIFELINE THAT SEVERAL OF OUR

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.804

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.673
INFLUX AS WELL. AND IN A

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.007
NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR MENTAL

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:07.276
WELLBEING STUDY OF FOUR

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:08.578
THOUSAND BIPAP ADULTS DURING

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:10.680
THE KOPET NINETEEN PANDEMIC

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:12.582
THEY FOUND THAT 11% OF BLACK

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.517
ADULTS THEY QUOTE FINDING AN

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:16.319
ORGANIZATION THAT LOOKS LIKE

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:18.387
ME. OR SHARES MY CULTURE AND

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.256
IDENTITY HAS BEEN THE LARGEST

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.291
OBSTACLE TO SEEKING TREATMENT

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:23.659
FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. NOW

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:25.528
WE'VE SEEN A RISE IN DEPRESSION

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:26.562
AND ANXIETY THAT HAVE BEEN

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:28.598
DIRECTLY LINKED TO HOW THIS

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:29.832
RACIAL PANDEMIC HAS REALLY

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:32.802
REARED ITS UGLY HEAD AND

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.003
IMPACTED MANY COMMUNITIES. SO

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.504
ALL OF THIS IS PROBLEMATIC AND

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.306
WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR STATE

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:38.474
WILL SEE AN INFLUX OF

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.042
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:42.278
AS CHILDREN GO BACK TO SCHOOL

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:43.279
AND PARENTS GO BACK TO IN

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.314
PERSON WORK. SO THERE'S A LOT

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.816
THAT NEEDS TO BE PROCESSED AND

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:48.284
THERE NEED TO BE SUPPORTS IN

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:49.852
THE COMMUNITY AND PLACE TO HELP

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:51.988
BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AND THEIR

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:54.090
COMMUNITIES COPE IN THE

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:55.858
AFTERMATH OF THESE PANDEMICS.

WITHOUT HOPE BECAUSE THE CHILD

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:47.463
HAS TO SURVIVE WHEN THEY GET

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.365
OUT THERE ON THE STREETS

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:49.899
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.934
OPTIONS. WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:54.069

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.529
OUR GOAL WAS TO RAISE AWARENESS

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:21.997
OF COVERT NINETEEN AND REDUCE

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.933
THE SPREAD OF THE DEADLY VIRUS

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:24.934
WITHIN THE AFRICAN ANSWERS TO

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.735
COMMUNITY WE CREATED A

01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:28.170
NARRATIVE THAT WE TOLD OUR OWN

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:31.507

PRODUCE HOW DO WE- REDUCE THE

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:39.381
SPREAD SO THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.150
EDUCATED NOT ON WHAT WE SEE ON

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:48.757
INITIATIVE THROUGHOUT THE BAY

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:52.361
AREA. AND WE LAUNCHED IT WITH A

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:54.230
TOWN HALL EVENT THAT HAD OVER

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:54.697
TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE IN

NINETEEN. WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:07.510
THE BACKPACKS OF TRAUMA BECAUSE

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.378
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR KIDS

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:10.880
AND OUR YOUNG FOLKS IN

01:09:10.946 --> 01:09:12.248
PARTICULAR AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.415
WHO ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.884
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED IN

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:17.186
EVERY LEVEL OF OUR SYSTEM. THE

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:18.754
BACKPACKS OF TRAUMA FROM

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:22.591
EDUCATION TO HEALTH. TO LEGAL

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:26.262
TO HOUSING- THOSE ARE ALL

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.597
THINGS THAT IMPACT AND WEIGH

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:29.732
HEAVY ON OUR COMMUNITIES ON

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:31.901
COVERT HIT IT WAS LIKE A TWELVE

ROUND. AND IT WAS A KNOCKOUT

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:39.642
BLOW. SO FOR US THIS WAS ABOUT

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:41.210
EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:42.578

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:46.115
STRING THING AND MAKE BETTER

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.383

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:01.363
ON INFORMATION THAT COMES TO

SOCIAL MEDIA OFTENTIMES WE KNOW

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:04.800
IS NOT NOT CORRECT OR IS

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.268
MISLEADING BECAUSE OF THE

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:07.436
CENTURIES OF INEQUALITIES THAT

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:09.104
HAVE IMPACTED HOW WE BELIEVE

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:10.673
AND TRUST IN OUR SYSTEMS. THAT

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.441
HAVE FAILED US FOR CENTURIES

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:13.809
AND SO THIS INITIATIVE HAS BEEN

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.611
A MAJOR IMPACT TO OUR ABILITY

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:16.745
TO MAKE SURE OUR FOLKS HAVE

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:17.913
EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.982
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO MAKE

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.317
THE PROPER DECISIONS. DO WE GET

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:22.985

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.487
WE SEE THE SPIKE RIGHT NOW-

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:26.622
THAT'S THE REALITY THAT WE'RE

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:27.890
DEALING WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.325
WITH OUR PROGRAMS. SO WE HAVE

YESTERDAY BUT WHAT THE VISION

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.384
CAN LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE.

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:56.652
ALSO HOW DO WE DO WITH THE

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.621
TRAUMA THAT OFTENTIMES WE DON'T

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:00.356

SEE THIS. TECHNOLOGY IS

01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:18.526
CRITICAL- TO REACHING SECTORS

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:19.126
OF THE COMMUNITY THAT

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:21.329

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:23.631
DIFFICULT TIME CONNECTING- AND

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:24.665

HOSPITALS. IN OUR CLINICS HAD

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:31.098
THE BURDEN OF- DEALING WITH

MONTH OF THE PANDEMIC AND IT'S

01:34:48.883 --> 01:34:50.918
BEEN INCREASING AND THEY'VE

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:52.887
BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE OBVIOUSLY.

01:34:52.953 --> 01:34:54.321
THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN THEY

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:57.224
COULD BEFORE AND SO- WE

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:58.859
PROBABLY DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:01.228
EXPLORE THIS TELEHEALTH FOR

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:02.563
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:05.666
BECAUSE THAT THAT MAY BE A

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.868
SAVING GRACE I MEAN IF. IT

01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:09.770
DEPICTS BEEN A PROBLEM BUT-

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:11.472
THIS TELEHEALTH THEY COULD BE

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.774
SOMETHING. THAT COULD TAKE US

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:16.077
IN IN PLACES THAT WE NEVER KNEW

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:17.111
BEFORE IT COULD BE VERY

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:18.646
HELPFUL. FOR DISADVANTAGED

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.185
DECIDE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.553
SINCE WE GOT SO MANY DOCTORS

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:27.721
HERE RIGHT NOW- MENTAL HEALTH

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:29.857
VERSUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:37.665
ANYWAY ANYBODY CAN TAKE- I

01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:39.366
WOULD JUST SAY THAT- ZERO

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:40.701
HEALTH I THINK THERE'S BEEN

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:41.902
MORE OF A SHIFT TOWARD AGAIN

01:35:41.969 --> 01:35:42.703
LIKE MEASUREMENT AND

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:44.371
QUANTIFICATION THAT'S EASIER TO

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:46.073
DO WITH BEHAVIOR THAN MENTAL

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.975
PROCESSES WHICH I THINK A LOT

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:50.711
OF PEOPLE- MIGHT SAY OUR- LOOK

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:52.580
A LITTLE HARDER TO OBSERVE OR

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:55.015
QUANTIFY- THAT THAT WOULD

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:56.517
PROBABLY BE ONE THING BUT WE

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.352
KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THOUGHTS ARE

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:00.554
SO LINKED TO BEHAVIORS AND WE

01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:01.722
WANT TO BE AS OBJECTIVE AS

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.457
POSSIBLE- REALLY KIND OF

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:05.793
FOCUSING ON BEHAVIOR. CAN TAKE

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:09.430
A- THIS ALSO REALLY SIMPLE

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:10.698
EXPLANATION OF PEOPLE SAY

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:11.866
MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN THEIR

01:36:11.932 --> 01:36:13.334
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND SO

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.301
WHEN YOU SAY MENTAL HEALTH OR

01:36:14.368 --> 01:36:15.369
NOT INCLUDING SUBSTANCE USE

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:16.504
DISORDER TREATMENT TO

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:17.304
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS A

01:36:17.371 --> 01:36:19.707
COMBINATION OF BOTH OF THOSE.

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:20.407
THIRTY EASIER WAY TO ADDRESS

01:36:20.474 --> 01:36:21.675
THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AN

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:23.544
INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T JUST. HALF

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:24.378
OF THEM SUFFERS FROM MENTAL

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:25.579

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.181
FROM A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:28.716

COUNTERING ALL OF THAT. IT'S A

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:31.485
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF THE NOT

PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON THE APRIL

01:36:49.904 --> 01:36:52.273
ESPECIALLY ON COMMUNITIES THAT

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:52.840
ALREADY TEND TO HAVE GREATER

01:36:52.907 --> 01:36:55.476
TRAUMA. CERVANTES AUDREY MY

01:36:55.543 --> 01:36:56.610

01:37:11.825 --> 01:37:13.594
GOING BACK TO THAT WAS ON THERE

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.796
ARE SIX MODEL. OF YOU KNOW

YEARS BUT IT'S A VERY.

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:19.867
EXPENSIVE TO DO ALL RIGHT YOU

CAN'T DO THIS WORK ON THE CHEAP.

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:25.773

THEY DIDN'T START THE CLINICS

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:41.522
THE END OF THE CLAIM WHICH THEY

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:42.423

DIVERSE FROM WHAT OTHERWISE IS

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:06.180
GOING TO BE A FAR MORE COSTLY

01:38:06.247 --> 01:38:08.048
OUTCOME- WHETHER IT'S

TO REMOVE SOME OF THE BARRIERS.

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:14.214
FOR LICENSED CLINICAL

BARRIERS OF ENTRY TO RECEIVE

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:29.530
CARE TO BE REDUCED. AND SO- FOR

FOLKS OUT THERE IN THE

01:39:30.297 --> 01:39:31.865
COMMUNITY HOPEFULLY. THIS MAKES

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:33.767

AND GET TO SIGNATURE SO THAT WE

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:36.704

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:39.133
EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO THAT

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:40.934
SUPPORTS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.924
TALKING THE CAREER PATHWAYS

02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:21.926
AND- CREATING GENERATIONAL

02:18:21.993 --> 02:18:24.262
WEALTH AND I AGREE WITH THE

02:18:24.329 --> 02:18:24.663
COMMENTS REGARDING

02:18:24.729 --> 02:18:26.731
APPRENTICESHIPS AND- INTERNSHIP

02:18:26.798 --> 02:18:28.133
OPPORTUNITIES WHAT HAVE YOU BUT

02:18:28.199 --> 02:18:32.604
I THINK THAT- I'VE I'VE HEARD A

02:18:32.671 --> 02:18:33.405
LOT ABOUT THAT OVER THE HERE'S-

02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:35.740
AND I MEAN OVER THE DECADES-

02:18:35.807 --> 02:18:37.976
AND THE DATA CONTINUES TO SHOW.

02:18:38.043 --> 02:18:40.178
THAT THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR

02:18:40.245 --> 02:18:41.780
PARTICULARLY BLACK LATINO

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:44.949
ENGINEERS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO.

02:18:45.016 --> 02:18:47.585
EVERY LEVEL OF THE CORPORATE

02:18:47.652 --> 02:18:49.854
AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF THESE

02:18:49.921 --> 02:18:50.422
COMPANIES THAT ARE PROFITING

02:18:50.488 --> 02:18:52.891
WILDLY- THEIR NUMBER NUMBERS ON

02:18:52.957 --> 02:18:54.159
THERE AND THE NUMBERS ARE THERE

02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:56.895
WAS LIMITED TO IN THE COLOR. SO

02:18:56.961 --> 02:18:58.396
THERE'S THE TELL ME THERE'S THE

02:18:58.463 --> 02:19:00.632
SHOW ME AND THE REALITY IS THAT

02:19:00.699 --> 02:19:03.168
WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THAT.

02:19:03.234 --> 02:19:05.203
THAT THE HIRING IS NOT

02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:08.306
HAPPENING AND WE HAVE. A BILL

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:09.474
WELL INTENTIONED WEATHER'S

02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:12.043
LEGISLATORS WERE. PARTNERS IN

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:14.079
THE COMMUNITY THAT. EVERY YEAR

02:19:14.145 --> 02:19:15.847
EVERY COUPLE YEARS COME BECAUSE

02:19:15.914 --> 02:19:16.681
COMMUNITY MORE MORE PROGRAMS ON

02:19:16.748 --> 02:19:18.349
THE OTHER AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:19:18.416 --> 02:19:19.718
IS THE HIRING PRACTICES THAT

02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:21.753
ARE NOT REFLECTING THE DESIRE

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:24.322
FOR THAT CHANGE- AND THAT GOES

02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:25.290
TO ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE

02:19:25.356 --> 02:19:26.958
REALITY IS THAT THE AMOUNT THAT

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:29.160
CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO HOP TO IT

02:19:29.227 --> 02:19:31.896
TO HIRE FOLKS. BUT ONE OF THE

02:19:31.963 --> 02:19:34.299
FEW THINGS WE CAN DO IS HOW

02:19:34.365 --> 02:19:36.768
TRANSPARENCY. AND TIME AND

02:19:36.835 --> 02:19:38.570
AGAIN- EFFORTS TO TRY TO GET

02:19:38.636 --> 02:19:41.372
DATA ON HIRING- IS NOT

02:19:41.439 --> 02:19:43.508
SUCCESSFUL AT LEAST NOT TO THE

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:44.743
EXTENT AS NECESSARY TO CREATE

02:19:44.809 --> 02:19:48.213
REAL CHANGE- I HAVE HAD A BILL

02:19:48.279 --> 02:19:50.014
THAT. I'M TRYING TO DO THAT

02:19:50.081 --> 02:19:51.649
THIS PAST YEAR IT WAS NOT

02:19:51.716 --> 02:19:52.250
SOMETHING WENT THROUGH OF THE

02:19:52.317 --> 02:19:54.886
NUMBER OF THEM OVER THE YEARS.

02:19:54.953 --> 02:19:58.123
AND SO YOU KNOW UNLESS- WERE

02:19:58.189 --> 02:20:00.759
ABLE TO GET REAL DATA ON HIRING

02:20:00.825 --> 02:20:01.926
PRACTICES ON DISCREPANCIES

02:20:01.993 --> 02:20:03.795
APPEAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ON

02:20:03.862 --> 02:20:09.467
DISCREPANCIES A PAY- BUT A BIT

02:20:09.534 --> 02:20:10.268
BETWEEN- YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE OF

02:20:10.335 --> 02:20:12.804
COLOR- IT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE

02:20:12.871 --> 02:20:14.639
ABLE TO. MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGE

02:20:14.706 --> 02:20:16.641
IN MY OPINION BECAUSE- IS THAT

02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:18.276
ACCOUNTABILITY IS THAT

02:20:18.343 --> 02:20:21.246
TRANSPARENCY. LEADS BROTHERS TO

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:22.180
SHAMING OR THROUGH THE PATS ON

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:23.815
THE BACK. THAT LEADS TO THE

02:20:23.882 --> 02:20:24.949
POSITIVE MOVEMENT IN THE RIGHT

02:20:25.016 --> 02:20:27.719
DIRECTION SO. I GOTTA GET OUT

02:20:27.786 --> 02:20:29.320
HERE BUT I THAT'S NOT MY LAST

02:20:29.387 --> 02:20:32.157
COMMENT BECAUSE- I THINK- YOU

02:20:32.223 --> 02:20:34.926
KNOW BUT WE- HEAR A LOT ABOUT.

02:20:34.993 --> 02:20:37.762
STEM PROGRAMS AND INTERNSHIP AT

02:20:37.829 --> 02:20:38.696
THE END OF THE DAY THE NUMBERS

02:20:38.763 --> 02:20:40.265
ARE NOT THERE. AND THEY HAVEN'T

02:20:40.331 --> 02:20:42.667
BEEN THERE FOR. MANY MERRILEES

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:43.701
CERTAINLY NOT TO THE EXTENT

02:20:43.768 --> 02:20:45.570
THAT THE ENERGY PUT INTO IT SO

02:20:45.637 --> 02:20:47.238
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS

02:20:47.305 --> 02:20:49.541
I DO APPRECIATE. EVERYTHING

02:20:49.607 --> 02:20:51.576
THAT OUR PRESENTERS OF. HAVE

02:20:51.643 --> 02:20:52.977
DEMONSTRATED AS THEIR DESIRE

02:20:53.044 --> 02:20:57.782
WHAT THEY LIKE. TO SEE- BECAUSE

02:20:57.849 --> 02:20:59.417
I'M WITH YOU. THANK YOU DID.

02:20:59.484 --> 02:21:01.352
DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY

02:21:01.419 --> 02:21:03.488
COMMENTS ARE SURE SURE ANOTHER

02:21:03.555 --> 02:21:06.291
THE- IN THE STATE GO FROM THERE

02:21:06.357 --> 02:21:09.360
YES NO I'M HAPPY I'M HAPPY TO-

02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:11.563
TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON ON ON

02:21:11.629 --> 02:21:13.164
THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE-

02:21:13.231 --> 02:21:14.666
YOU'RE RIGHT OUR NUMBERS ARE

02:21:14.732 --> 02:21:18.770
NOT THERE I WILL SAY. THAT I

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:20.772
BELIEVE THAT- SO WE'RE IN A

02:21:20.839 --> 02:21:22.807
DIFFERENT TIME RIGHT NOW AND I

02:21:22.874 --> 02:21:25.243
THINK YOU KNOW- THE PANDEMIC

02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:28.279
WITHOUT A DOUBT YOU KNOW OPENED

02:21:28.346 --> 02:21:29.814
A LOT OF EYES AROUND THE

02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:32.517
DISPARITIES- I THINK ONE OF THE

02:21:32.584 --> 02:21:34.686
COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE ABOUT

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:36.654
LOOKING AT HIRING PRACTICES.

02:21:36.721 --> 02:21:38.189
THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR AN

02:21:38.256 --> 02:21:40.258
ORGANIZATION TO LOOK AT THEIR

02:21:40.325 --> 02:21:42.327
INTERNAL PROCESSES AND SIT AND

02:21:42.393 --> 02:21:44.662
QUESTION THEMSELVES HOW ARE WE

02:21:44.729 --> 02:21:46.798
HIRING WHAT IS THE APPLICATION

02:21:46.865 --> 02:21:48.566
LOOK LIKE HOW DO WE MAKE IT

02:21:48.633 --> 02:21:52.070
MORE INCLUSIVE AND MORE OPEN.

02:21:52.136 --> 02:21:53.371
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT MANY

02:21:53.438 --> 02:21:55.006
ORGANIZATIONS ARE WRESTLING

02:21:55.073 --> 02:21:58.810
WITH SO- WHILE WELL I. I HEAR

02:21:58.877 --> 02:22:01.913
YOU ON ON THE FRUSTRATION I

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:03.281
ALSO SEE IT WITHIN

02:22:03.348 --> 02:22:04.883
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TRYING

02:22:04.949 --> 02:22:06.885
TO DO BETTER. YOU KNOW THEY'RE

02:22:06.951 --> 02:22:08.019
THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET

02:22:08.086 --> 02:22:11.022
THERE- I THINK THAT THERE'S

02:22:11.089 --> 02:22:14.893
SEVERAL- YOU KNOW- PRIVACY

02:22:14.959 --> 02:22:16.327
MATTERS AND THINGS OF A THINGS

02:22:16.394 --> 02:22:18.563
THAT ARE RELATED TO HIM MORE

02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:20.565
THE HUMAN RESOURCE FUNCTION.

02:22:20.632 --> 02:22:22.233
THAT I THINK THAT- ATTRIBUTES

02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:24.369
WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. NUMBER

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:27.538
LESS BY IF I WERE TO SAY YOU

02:22:27.605 --> 02:22:29.307
KNOW THIS POSITIVE OUTLOOK IS

02:22:29.374 --> 02:22:31.676
THAT I SEE ORGANIZATIONS

02:22:31.743 --> 02:22:33.444
WORKING AT THIS HARD. AND

02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:35.446
LOOKING AT IT IN TERMS OF HOW

02:22:35.513 --> 02:22:38.216
CAN WE SOLVE THIS HOW CAN WE BE

02:22:38.283 --> 02:22:41.152
MORE OPEN AND MORE INCLUSIVE.

02:22:41.219 --> 02:22:42.720
AND FOR US AT THE CHAMBER WE'RE

02:22:42.787 --> 02:22:43.755
GOING TO RUN WITH THOSE

02:22:43.821 --> 02:22:45.290
ORGANIZATIONS AND HELP CREATE

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:47.892
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHERS SO I

02:22:47.959 --> 02:22:50.028
THINK- YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A

02:22:50.094 --> 02:22:52.363
DIFFERENT TIME TODAY. AND

02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:54.032
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK

02:22:54.098 --> 02:22:57.068
FOR US TO REALLY HAVE- YOU KNOW

02:22:57.135 --> 02:22:58.870
BUSINESSES STEP UP AND HELP

02:22:58.937 --> 02:23:02.273
THEM HELP THEM. YOU KNOW DEFINE

02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:03.741
YOU KNOW WHAT IT WHAT NEEDS

02:23:03.808 --> 02:23:05.243
WHAT PROCESSES NEED TO BE IN

02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:06.678
PLACE SO THAT THERE'S MORE

02:23:06.744 --> 02:23:08.813
TRANSPARENCY AND THERE'S MORE

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:10.214
OPPORTUNITY AT THE END OF THE

02:23:10.281 --> 02:23:11.716
DAY IT'S THE OUTCOMES THAT WILL

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:13.051
MATTER THAT'S AWESOME ABOUT

02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:14.419
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I

02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:15.720
THINK WE ARE A DIFFERENT TIME.

02:23:15.787 --> 02:23:17.555
AND I DON'T DOUBT INTENTIONS

02:23:17.622 --> 02:23:19.157
BUT I THINK INTENTIONS HAVE TO

02:23:19.223 --> 02:23:20.124
BE DEALT YES AND THOSE ARE

02:23:20.191 --> 02:23:20.925
COMES OUT THERE AND I KNOW

02:23:20.992 --> 02:23:22.193
THAT. THEIR OTHER METRICS

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:23.428
INVOLVED I KNOW THAT SURE AND I

02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:25.063
HAVE BEEN PART OF CONVERSATIONS

02:23:25.129 --> 02:23:26.264
WHERE THERE'S DIFFERENT

02:23:26.331 --> 02:23:28.066
PROGRAMMING ALEX USED TO ROOT

02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:30.435
OUT. THE KIND OF THE BIAS THAT

02:23:30.501 --> 02:23:32.170
EXISTED AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:23:32.236 --> 02:23:33.705
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO IT. I

02:23:33.771 --> 02:23:35.606
THINK WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK FIVE

02:23:35.673 --> 02:23:36.341
YEARS AND I DON'T SEE OF THE

02:23:36.407 --> 02:23:38.142
OUTCOMES MATCH THE INTENSITY OF

02:23:38.209 --> 02:23:39.811
THE INTENTIONS AND A LAWSUIT

02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:41.145
MENTIONS ON THE GENERATIONAL

02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:42.280
WEALTH ONE OF THE GREATEST FROM

02:23:42.347 --> 02:23:43.247
GENERATIONAL WEALTH. IS

02:23:43.314 --> 02:23:45.183
PROPERTY ARE THERE ARE STILL A

02:23:45.249 --> 02:23:47.552
NORMAL. ONE NORMA'S RACISM AND

02:23:47.618 --> 02:23:55.026
BARRIERS TO PROPERTY OWNERSHIP.

02:23:55.093 --> 02:23:55.593
AND NOW MORE THAN EVER WE'RE

02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:57.161
SEEING- THE LAW FROM AND-

02:23:57.228 --> 02:23:59.163
OWNERS IMPROPER THERE NOW BUT A

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:01.799
FOREVER. THE DOOR I PRETTY

02:24:01.866 --> 02:24:03.501
HONOR. HAS BEEN- TO BLOCK FOUND

02:24:03.568 --> 02:24:04.902
THAT JENNA OF THE BLOCK OUT OF

02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:05.970
IT AND SOMETHING THAT SAYS ONE

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:06.838
OF THING THAT WE HAVE TO BE

02:24:06.904 --> 02:24:08.206
INTO ABOUT THAT WE WANT TO SEE

02:24:08.272 --> 02:24:13.044
ABOUT. RESULT. IT DID NOT AND I

02:24:13.111 --> 02:24:17.849
KNOW IN IN MY DISTRICT- USC HAS

02:24:17.915 --> 02:24:20.651
A BASE DATE. IT I GIVE A

02:24:20.718 --> 02:24:22.787
PROGRAM EVERY YEAR ON ON ON

02:24:22.854 --> 02:24:25.156
STEM PROGRAMS BRING KIDS FROM

02:24:25.223 --> 02:24:27.291
THE COMMUNITY TO COME IN WANT

02:24:27.358 --> 02:24:28.760
TO BE ON CAMPUS WE GET USED TO

02:24:28.826 --> 02:24:30.261
THE CAMPUS ENVIRONMENT SOME OF

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:32.730
NEVER THEY WALKED AROUND USC

02:24:32.797 --> 02:24:34.265
BUT THEY NEVER WALK THROUGH OR

02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:37.602
IN USC. EDITOR A BLOCK AWAY AND

02:24:37.668 --> 02:24:38.936
SO I BRING THEM ON CAMPUS AND

02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:40.071
THEN I BRING TO THE PATERNITY

02:24:40.138 --> 02:24:41.906
SCHOOL REGION AREA AND THEY

02:24:41.973 --> 02:24:43.908
THEY DO ENGINEERING THINGS WITH

02:24:43.975 --> 02:24:46.778
HIM AND THE FUN PART OF IT IS

02:24:46.844 --> 02:24:49.814
IT IS AN ALL MATH AND IN

02:24:49.881 --> 02:24:52.683
SCIENCE IT'S FOUGHT IT SO WE

02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:54.852
SHOOT OFF ROCKETS RIA DO ALL

02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:57.522
THE FUN THINGS AND I JUST

02:24:57.588 --> 02:24:58.623
REMEMBER JUST JUST SITTING WITH

02:24:58.689 --> 02:25:05.963
THEM. AND SAYING THAT- THERE'S.

02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:06.564
DID YOU CAN GET A DEGREE. AND

UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE AND- BUT

02:25:15.273 --> 02:25:16.574
AT THAT TIME WHEN I FIRST

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:18.609
STARTED- NEW YORK UNIVERSITY

02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:20.178
HAD DIRT AT THE BEST GATE

02:25:20.244 --> 02:25:22.547
MEANS. AND YOU START OUT MAKING

02:25:22.613 --> 02:25:24.215
LIKE EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND

02:25:24.282 --> 02:25:25.817
BECAUSE OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:25:25.883 --> 02:25:26.317
DOLLARS A YEAR WHEN YOU

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:28.719
GRADUATE AND I SAID DIDN'T AND

02:25:28.786 --> 02:25:31.289
THEN YOU SEE THESE KIDS GO OKAY

02:25:31.355 --> 02:25:32.890
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. I

02:25:32.957 --> 02:25:34.625
GO TO COLLEGE FOR FOUR YEARS

02:25:34.692 --> 02:25:38.262
SHOULD. I LEARNED EVERYTHING I

LACKEY. JUST REAL BRIEFLY I. I

02:34:33.831 --> 02:34:35.899
THINK SOME SOME VERY VALID

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:38.035
POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE- THROUGH

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:40.604
THE REMARKS OF- PANELIST AND

02:34:40.671 --> 02:34:42.740
SPEAKERS HERE TODAY. I THINK

02:34:42.806 --> 02:34:44.174
THAT- ONE OF THE GREAT

02:34:44.241 --> 02:34:46.543
CHALLENGES THAT WE- FACE AS A

02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:48.445
SOCIETY IS GETTING AND ONE OF

02:34:48.512 --> 02:34:50.381
THE GREAT BARRIERS- THAT WE

02:34:50.447 --> 02:34:52.216
FACE IS GETTING OUR YOUNG

02:34:52.282 --> 02:34:54.852
PEOPLE ESPECIALLY. BOYS AND MEN

02:34:54.918 --> 02:34:57.554
OF COLOR TO BELIEVE IN-THEMSELVES. AND I THINK THE WAY

02:34:57.621 --> 02:34:59.823
WE DO THAT IS WHICH WAS

02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:02.326
OUTLINED IN SOME OF THE- OTHER

02:35:02.393 --> 02:35:03.127
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMMING IS TO

02:35:03.193 --> 02:35:06.830
BUILD. MENTORSHIP AND THE SENSE

02:35:06.897 --> 02:35:09.533
OF FAMILY PEOPLE THEY TRUST.

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:10.567
BECAUSE THAT'S WHO THEY RESPOND

02:35:10.634 --> 02:35:13.537
TO. AND- I THINK THERE'S BEEN A

02:35:13.604 --> 02:35:16.440
LOT OF. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OF-

02:35:16.507 --> 02:35:17.641
DOES ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRUST THE

02:35:17.708 --> 02:35:20.077
RIGHT PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT

02:35:20.144 --> 02:35:21.945
THAT'S LED TO A VERY-

02:35:22.012 --> 02:35:22.379
DISCOURAGING CENTER

02:35:22.446 --> 02:35:24.114
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE-

02:35:24.181 --> 02:35:25.582
REALIZING NOW AND I THINK THAT

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:28.485
WE'RE ALL. TRYING TO PARTNER

02:35:28.552 --> 02:35:31.355
AND I THINK THAT- AS WE

02:35:31.422 --> 02:35:34.091
ENCOURAGE OUR YOUNG MEN AND-

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:37.061
OUR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR TO-

02:35:37.127 --> 02:35:38.862
TO EMBRACE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE

02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:40.497
TO ALSO YOU KNOW ENHANCE

02:35:40.564 --> 02:35:41.932
OPPORTUNITIES BUT ONCE THOSE

02:35:41.999 --> 02:35:44.234
OPPORTUNITIES COME. YOU HAVE TO

02:35:44.301 --> 02:35:45.903
REACT YOU HAVE TO REACT IN A

02:35:45.969 --> 02:35:48.906
POSITIVE MANNER AND WE NEED TO

02:35:48.972 --> 02:35:50.140
MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THAT AND

02:35:50.207 --> 02:35:52.142
COURAGE IN. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE

02:35:52.209 --> 02:35:54.278
TO- TAKE THESE OPPORTUNITIES

02:35:54.344 --> 02:35:54.812
BECAUSE THEIR TRUST LEVELS

02:35:54.878 --> 02:35:57.748
LOWER. AND THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF

02:35:57.815 --> 02:35:58.348
DISCOURAGE MOOD THEY'VE HAD A

02:35:58.415 --> 02:36:00.184
LOT OF THE- NEGATIVE

02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:03.687
EXPERIENCES AND TO GET. PEOPLE

02:36:03.754 --> 02:36:05.756
TO REFOCUS THEIR TRUST IT'S

02:36:05.823 --> 02:36:08.392
DIFFICULT AND SO I THINK THAT'S

02:36:08.459 --> 02:36:09.693
WHERE OUR FOCUS NEEDS TO BE IN

02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:10.794
ON THE COURAGE BY ALL THE

02:36:10.861 --> 02:36:12.062
ORGANIZATIONS AND ALL THE

02:36:12.129 --> 02:36:14.064
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:36:14.131 --> 02:36:16.133
NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE WHEN

02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.134
IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE THE TRUE

02:36:17.201 --> 02:36:18.335
MEASURE OF SUCCESS OUR

02:36:18.402 --> 02:36:20.137
OUTCOMES. AND IF WE'RE NOT

02:36:20.204 --> 02:36:22.072
GETTING OUTCOMES WERE NOT-

02:36:22.139 --> 02:36:23.874
MOVING WHERE WE NEED TO GO SO

02:36:23.941 --> 02:36:26.510
I'M VERY HOPEFUL AND- I THANK

02:36:26.577 --> 02:36:28.045
EVERYBODY FOR THEIR TIME TODAY.
