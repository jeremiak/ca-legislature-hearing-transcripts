THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES SB THREE SEVENTY NINE- WILL REQUIRE JURISDICTIONS ABOVE A CERTAIN SIZE TO IMPLEMENT AUTOMATED ONLINE SOLAR PERMITTING. FOR SIMPLE RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP. SYSTEMS AND ALSO SOLAR PLUS STORAGE SYSTEMS WATER COMMENTED THIS REQUEST IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE APPROPRIATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS ARE FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR CITIES AND IMPLEMENTING- THIS. NEW PROCESS ARE CURRENTLY ARE CALLING SOLAR PERMITTING CAN BE VERY INEFFICIENT CAN TAKE A LONG TIME- AND CAN INCREASE OFF COSTS BY UPWARDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS- WHICH CAUSES A NUMBER OF APPLICANTS TO DROP OUT OF THE PROCESS. I ENTIRELY- AUTOMATED ONLINE SOLAR PERMITTING ALLOWS FOR SIMPLIFIED A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT- SOLUTION BY ALLOWING APPLICANTS TO APPLY IMMEDIATELY DETERMINE- IF THEY'RE PROPOSED SYSTEM IS CODE COMPLIANT. KERN AUTOMATED PERMITTING SYSTEMS ARE CAPABLE OF HANDLING FOURTEEN TIMES THE NUMBER OF PERMITS A TYPICAL METHODS- IN SAN JOSE FOR EXAMPLE WHICH RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM SALAS 6100% INCREASE AND PERMIT APPLICATIONS. THIS INCREASED VOLUME IS NOT A BURDEN ON BUILDING APARTMENTS BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM IS AUTOMATED- AND- IT WILL GENERATE MORE REVENUE- FOR THEM TO BE CLEAR CITIES WILL STILL HAVE THE PREROGATIVE TO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS- BUT THIS IS SIMPLY THE PERMITTING- ALTHOUGH SB THREE SEVENTY NINE DOES NOT MANDATE A SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY OR SYSTEM- THERE IS. ONE THAT WAS BUILT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY- BY THE NOT REVIEW ENERGY LIVES- YOU AFTER A LONG STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE ANTICIPATE THIS IS THE ONE THAT MOST CITIES. WHAT IS NOT.

I HIGHS THIRTY ONE KNOWS ONE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS MOVING ON A FILE ITEM SIXTY THREE SENATE BILL THREE EIGHTY SEVEN. I'M SORRY FILE ITEM SIXTY FOUR. MEMBERS ARE GOING TO FILE ITEM SIXTY FOUR SENATE BILL THREE EIGHTY SEVEN CENTER PORTANTINO SECRETARY PLEASE READ BY SENATOR PORTANTINO AN ACT RELATING TO PEOPLE HEALTH. CARE PORTANTINO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS WE NOW CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS. AND IT'S BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC WITH DISTANCE LEARNING OUR YOUTH ARE INCREASINGLY ISOLATED AND DISENGAGED WITH DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. ACCORDING TO US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NEARLY ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SURVEYED REPORTED FEELING SAD OR HOPELESS ALMOST EVERY DAY. FOR TWO OR MORE WEEKS IN A ROW NEARLY ONE IN FIVE REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THIS CRISIS AS SUCH MUST BE TRAINED TO IDENTIFY AND HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE SUFFERING. RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT THE SOONER PEOPLE GET HELP FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE CONCERNS THE MORE LIKELY WE ARE TO HAVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME. THIS BILL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS ARE TRANSITIONING TEACHERS ARE ENCOUNTERING BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES RESULTING FROM EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THEIR STUDENTS. THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN STUDENTS RETURN TO SCHOOL THEIR TRAUMA AND DEPRESSION RETURNS WITH THEM IF WE DON'T REIN. PRINCE AND IT MANAGED. WE WITH ALL THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO HAVE BY DE. A CRY. A LACK OF TRAINING DOESN'T KEEP STUDENTS PRESSURED OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS AT HOME. WHILE EXISTING LAW BECAUSE UPON THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO I DON'T. BUT IN IS MEANT. GRAMS IT DOES. TOOLS THE PROGRAM AFTER AND STARTED THIS CON. AND I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADER ON THIS ISSUE AND HIS CAN TO. AT PEDIATRICIAN. STAND BY THIS IS IMPORTANT OUR KIDS AND FRANKLY THE SENATE UNDERSTANDS WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR KIDS IN THIS BILL HAS PASSED THIS HOUSE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE PAST AND FRANKLY I'M GONNA KEEP INTRODUCING IT EVERY SINGLE YEAR UNTIL IT GETS ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN HELPS ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING BY REQUIRING CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT 75% OF FOLKS WHO WORK ON OUR CAMPUSES ARE TRAINED. MANDATING EVIDENCE BASED TRAINING WILL X. WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INSTRUCTION ON HOW STUDENTS TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF. CAN BEST PROVIDE REFERRALS AND HELP FOR OUR CHILDREN LET'S BE CLEAR. THIS TRAINING DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO TURN STAFF OR TEACHERS INTO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IT SIMPLY TEACHES AN INDIVIDUAL HOW TO SPOT WHERE THERE'S A PROBLEM OR FIRST AID TAKING A FIRST AID CLASS DOESN'T MAKE YOU A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IT JUST MAKES YOU BETTER PREPARED TO HELP SOMEBODY IN NEED. DURING OUR HEARING LAST YEAR A FATHER CALLED IN AND TALKED ABOUT HIS FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. WHO TURNED IN HER JOURNAL ASSIGNMENT IN ENGLISH CLASS AND GOT A NAY. AND THEN TWO WEEKS LATER KILLED HERSELF. AND THE FATHER SAID I DON'T BLAME THE TEACHER BECAUSE THE TEACHER WASN'T TRYING TO SEE THE WARNING SIGNS OF SUICIDE IN THAT JOURNAL. BUT FRANKLY GOING FORWARD THAT TEACHERS SHOULD BE TRAINED. TO SEE THE WARNING SIGNS I KNOW STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS TO WORK ON OUR CAMPUS SHOULD BE TRAINED. TO SEE THE WARNING SIGNS OF MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES IN OUR CHILDREN. AND I'M TIRED OF HEARING AND SEEING PUSH BACK. THAT'S ANTI TRAINING WHEN OUR KIDS ARE IN SUCH DIRE NEED AND SO COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION UNTIL IT GETS ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND GET TO SIGNATURE. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO CENTER RUBIO FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ARCHULETA SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I ALSO STAND HERE AND VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN- I WANNA TACKLE EVERY SINGLE THING THAT A GREAT CENTER FROM WALKING OUT OF STATE IT AND I CAN SHARE. AS A EXPERT TEACHER SEVENTEEN YEARS I THINK IS ME INSIDE S. TO WHAT WE DEAL WITH. OUR I NGUYEN WEARING CLASSROOMS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I OFTEN SAY IS THAT- WE'RE EXPECTED TO TEACH WHICH WE DO WELL BUT- THE OTHER ELEMENT IS THAT WERE EXPECTED TO BE COUNSELORS MENTORS PSYCHOLOGISTS. AND TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL IN FACT. I WOULD ARGUE THAT NOW THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS PANDEMIC ISOLATION. AND PERSONAL STORIES THAT I HEAR FROM MY TEACHER COLLEAGUES. THERE PERSONALLY STRUGGLING WITH WITH ISSUES OF MEAN DATA TEACHERS ARE STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO TEACH HOW TO CAPTURE THESE KIDS THAT ARE COMING AND TRAUMATIZED. STRAZ AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT COMES WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING THE PAST TWO YEARS AND I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE WAY. OF SAYING TO TEACHERS WE CARE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE WELL EQUIPPED TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE OF CRISIS ON OUR HANDS SO. I WILL SAY AGAIN BOB WITH EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM WE DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE. ON HAVE BEEN UP BY H. AND WE ARE STRUGGLING OFF TO TAKE. THESE KIDS ARE DEALING WITH SOMETHING MORE THAN WE CAN DEAL WITH ARE WHEN I HEAR THAT ONE IN FIVE ARE. THINKING OF ATTEMPTING SUICIDE ONE IN FIVE. IS WAY TOO MANY KIDS I WOULD SAY ONE IS WAY TOO MANY KIDS BUT- I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR THIS. I REALLY HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND I STRONGLYURGE EVERYONE ELSE UP TO VOTE I THINK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER RUBIO SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I SHOULD ALSO STAND STRONG SUPPORT. OF SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN. AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS. THAT WHEN I'VE HAD MY ROUND TABLE DISCUSSIONS WITH BOARD OF EDUCATION MEMBERS AND- AND COUNSELORS AND SCHOOL TEACHERS IN MY DISTRICT- THE SUBJECT OF MENTAL HEALTH WILL ALWAYS COME UP. HOW BETTER SURE REPRESENT OUR STUDENTS. AND ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT WE GIVE THE TRAINING AND- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO LOVE AND TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKILL. TO KNOW WHEN SOMETHING IS WRONG. HOW DO WE KNOW AND MOST WERE TRAINED. AT THE SENATOR MENTIONED ABOUT FIRST AID HOW DO WE KNOW HOW TO TREAT AND LESS WERE GIVEN THE TRAINING. AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE'LL NEED- TO TAKE IT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE CALIFORNIA. WILL LEAD AND PROTECTING AND SERVING THESE KIDS EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE HEAR ABOUT GANG VIOLENCE WE HEAR ABOUT. IT THE CITIES- HAVING ISSUES WE HEAR ABOUT IT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. REGARDLESS OF THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF THE CHILDREN THE SCHOOL. IT IS A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND THE CANNABINOID HAS NOT HELPED. IN THE ONLY WAY WE CA HELP IS TO GIVE THE RESOURCES AND THE TIME THE EFFORT. TO THOSE IN THE EDUCATIONAL INDUSTRY. TO BE ABLE TO BE WELL TRAINED WELL SUITED TO BE ABLE TO SPOT IT. PICK UP THE PHONE CALL SOMEONE. GOT SOMEBODY WE CAN SAVE LIVES THIS WEEKEND ARE WE GONNA PREVENTS. SIDE YES WE CAN ARE WE GOING TO MAKE BETTER STUDENTS ALL THE WAY AROUND. YES WE CAN THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL GET TOGETHER. IN TOTAL SUPPORT SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN. AND I ASK FOR I. HIS LEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY- AND- HE REALLY HAS BEEN A- HUGE CHAMPION FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH AND- FOR. IMPORTANCE OF SCREENING. I WOULD POINT OUT AS HE'S MENTIONED IN HIS REMARKS THAT WE- STILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY HERE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR YOUTH WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TEACHERS HAVE A LOT ON THEIR PLATE. AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO. AND BUT THEY ARE INTERFACING WITH THE STUDENTS IN A CLASSROOM AND THEY ARE THE BEST PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO HELP IDENTIFY YOUTH IN NEED HELP. BUT THIS WAS MENTIONED. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TURN THEM INTO MENTAL HEALTH. EXPERTS IT'S NOT THAT'S THEIR JOB. TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TREAT THEM AS WELL THE INDEMNIFYAND THEN WE NEED TO BE SURE TO SOME PLACE FOR THE THOSE USED TO GO. AND SO OF COURSE I RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT LAST YEAR WE INCLUDED IN THE STATE BUDGET FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE THOSE INVESTMENTS. BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE BY WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ENOUGH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS. TO SEND IN THE CLASSROOM TO WATCH ALL THE STUDENTS ALL THE TIME. RIGHT TEACHERS ARE A IN THE CLASSROOM BUT THEY CAN PICK UP THE SCIENCE AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THIS BILL. WE HAVE TEACHERS. TRAINED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SIGNS AND THEN WE NEED TO DO OUR JOB TO BE SURE THERE SOMEPLACE FOR THOSE USED TO GO WHEN THE TEACHER SAID YOU KNOW WHAT. I'M GONNA FIND YOU. OBLONG THEY NEED HELP. AND WE ARE BE SURE TO HELP IS THERE. SO BUT INTEL BUT WITHOUT THAT FIRST STEP. WE'RE GONNA HAVE ANOTHER GAP. IN TERMS OF OUR YOUTH GETTING HELP AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES AND I'M STANDING IN STRONG SUPPORT AND AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LIKE THE AUTO FOR. HIS ADVOCACY IS LEADERSHIP. AND WHILE- APPRECIATING GIVE ME CREDIT FOR STARTING THIS SEASON WAS GONNA TAKE THIS OVER THE FINISH LINE AND I HOPE YOU WILL HELP THEM DO THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN WE'RE GOING TO GO TO SENATOR STERN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR EGGMAN. SENATE STERN SUPPORTER THIS MEASURE AND I WOULD SORT OF I WOULD ADD TO THE CONVERSATION- THERE WHEN WE DO SPOT. THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY ARISE. WE DO NEED TO SERVICES IN PLACE AND WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN IT A SHOT AT ONE TIME FUNDING IN THIS SPACE. ABOUT THE SURGEON GENERAL NOTED THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THEY WILL JUST GO AWAY NEXT FOR NEXT YEAR. WE PUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I THINK TO SUPPLEMENT ELEAZAR LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET. BUT UNTIL THE HEALTH INSURANCE SPACE STARTS TO INTEGRATE ITSELF INTO THE EDUCATION SECTOR. AND ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT MENTAL HEALTH CARE UP FRONT. AN OFFSET THOSE PRESSURES THAT ARE ON OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW IT'S STILL WE START TO SYNERGIZE. I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE. A LOT MORE PROBLEMS THAN WE REALIZE BUT THE FIRST STEP IS BRINGING SOME LIGHT TO THE SITUATION AND THANK GOD FOR SCHOOL TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS AND EVERYONE ELSE OUT THERE WHO HOPEFULLY WILL BE OUT THERE IS WATCHERS ON THE WALL TO HELP CATCH PEOPLE BEFORE THEY FALL SO THANK YOU. THE CENTER FROM WALKING OUT OF FRANKLIN RIDGE BUT I HOPE THIS COMMITS US TO A DEEPER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE LINES ARE TO BE OR LACK THEREOF BETWEEN SCHOOLS. AND OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER STERN CENTER EGGMAN WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DRAWS OF SENATOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS FINE BILL- I WORKED ON THIS A LITTLE BIT A COUPLE YEARS AGO AS WELL AS SOME EW FROM MY DISTRICT ASSEMBLY ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. AND DOES A LOT OF WORK WITH KIDS PRODUCTS THIS IDEA ABOUT MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH FOR STATE IS A FANTASTIC IDEA WE JUST HEARD FROM. SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO THIS LAST WEEK ABOUT RABBIS HAVING TO GET TRAINED IN BEING ABLE TO DE ESCALATE SITUATIONS UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS DAY AND AGE WE ALL HAVE TO GET CROSS TRAINED IN OFTENTIMES. CLERGY ARE PART. ARE THE FIRST ONES ON SITE FOR ALL KINDS OF EMERGENCIES THESE DAYS. THEY HAVE ACTIVE SHOOTING. TRAINING NOW THERE'S NO REASON THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID AT THE SAME TIME. WELL WITH SOMEONE NEW HOW TO DO CPR WE HAD A HEART ATTACK. JUST LIKE THAT WE ALL WISH SOMEBODY WAS THERE TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF OUR KIDS ARE HAVING TROUBLES IN SCHOOL. I WOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU SIR EDMUND CENTER DORADO. THANK YOU- I KNOW AS SOME OF US. SOMETIMES WE DON'T. PREPARE AND THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET UP AND SPEAK BUT- AFTER HEARING THE AUTHOR ON DESCRIBED THIS. IT REALLY- BROUGHT CAME TO MY ATTENTION SO. I'M DEFINITELY. GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BUT- I WANT TO ADD THAT IT'S A MATTER OF HOW WE USE OUR RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC SAFETY. ARE THERE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT HOW PUBLIC SAFETY USES. THE FUNDING THAT THEY GET BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. WHEN IT'S THIS EXPLICIT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. TRAINING AND TEACHING AND LEARNING A DIFFERENT WAY. OF APPROACHING ISSUES AND PROBLEMS- THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR ALL OF US SO I URGE AND I WILL. THANK YOU SENATOR RAZA MEMBERS ANY OTHER ANYMORE DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER PORTANTINO HAD LOTS OF COMMENTS AND SUPPORT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND APPRECIATED AND CERTAINLY OUR CHILDREN APPRECIATED AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THIS QUALIFIES FOR UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO USING UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL ON FILE ITEM SIXTY FOUR. ANY OBJECTION. SEEING NONE IS THIRTY SIX KNOWS ZERO MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS WE ARE GOING ON TO FILE ITEM SIXTY FIVE. WHICH IS SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTEEN SENATOR HERTZBERG SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTEEN BY SENATOR HERTZBERG AN ACT RELATING TO HOMELESS SHELTERS SENATORS BURKE. THEY MUST PRESIDENTIAL. THIS GOVERNMENT IN CALIFORNIA OUR GOVERNOR AND THIS LEGISLATURE IN BOTH HOUSES IF AUTHORIZED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT HOMELESSNESS. WITH PASSED NUMEROUS BILLS TO FIGHT HOMELESSNESS AND NEARLY 24% OF OUR COUNTRY'S HOMELESS POPULATION RESIDES IN CALIFORNIA A HUNDRED FIFTY CALIFORNIA FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE HOMELESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. SO THE CALL POSTED BY THIS BILL. WHICH WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AGAIN LAST YEAR. WHAT IS WHAT IS GOING ON THE STREET AND WHAT CAN WE DO THAT'S THOUGHTFUL AND INTELLIGENT THAT HELPS GET FOLKS OFF THE STREET. IN CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH A NUMBER OF FOLKS. WHO FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESSNESS HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO SHELTER WITHOUT MY PET. EIGHT HAPPENING. ACCORDING TO THE NONPROFIT FEEDING PETS FOR THE HOMELESSNESS ESTIMATED 15225% OF AMERICANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OWN A DOG OR CAT IN SOME INSTANCES OTHER ANIMALS THAT I'VE SEEN. AND SO WHAT WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WAS TO INCLUDE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET- TO STAND UP THE PET ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT PROGRAM AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY OVERSUBSCRIBED. DRAMATICALLY LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR APPROVED IN THIS LEGISLATURE SUGGESTED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SIMILAR PROGRAM. THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU TODAY BUILDS ON THE SUCCESSES OF THE PET ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND PUTS IN THE SYSTEM THE PROGRAM PERMANENTLY INTO OUR STRUCTURE OBVIOUSLY EVERY YEAR WILL HAVE TO MAKE AN APPROPRIATION. BUT AS WE DEAL WITH THIS EXTRA. HOMELESSNESS IMPORTANT TO FIND THOSE AREAS WHERE THE IMPACT IS EXTRAORDINARY THE COST IS LESS AND THE ANSWER IS HUMANE FOR THAT I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU A MISTER PRESIDENT I AS I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT- MY COLLEAGUE. IS VERY CORRECT ON THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT FACE. HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IS THAT THEY HAVE NO PLACE FOR THEIR PETS IN THE SHELTER THE GOVERNOR AUTHORIZE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE BUDGET LAST YEAR THIS YEAR IS EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ACCOUNTED TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS POPULATION. AND HOMELESS POPULATION INCREASES WHEN IT 28% IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES MYSELF AND MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAS ASKED THE GOVERNOR FOR A SPECIAL SESSION TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS ISSUE BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS- THE HOMELESS ARE LEAVING AND NOT ONLY JUST BECOMING MORE IN OUR STATE- WE HAVE 13% OF THE NATION'S POPULATION AND 47% OF THE HOMELESS- AND SHE- POPULATION. AND WE'VE ASKED FOR A SPECIAL SESSION TO ADDRESS THIS INDIVIDUALS ARE BECOMING MORE. IN THE- MORE. DOWN THE STREET EVIDENT WITH YOU SEE STOOD ON A THAT WAS STABBED TO DEATH WAS WAS WORKING PART TIME AT A FURNITURE STORE ALLEGEDLY BY A HOMELESS PERSON YORK CITY ALLEGEDLY A HOMELESS PERSON THREE SOMEBODY ON TO THE TRAIN TRACKS SO WE DO HAVE TO ADDRESS ALL CAPACITY OF THE HOME SITUATION NOT JUST HOUSING FIRST BUT MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE- THE BENEFIT OF SINGER APERAM SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ADDRESSED AND DRUG ADDICTION SPECIFICALLY. THIS BILL REMINDS ME OF A STORY THAT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT JUST LAST YEAR WE TOOK IN MORE VETERAN ON THE STREET AND- I HAD MET HIM AND I GOT STAFF ON IT RIGHT AWAY AND WITHIN THREE DAYS I SAID CAN YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE FOR THIS PERSON YOU KNOW WE PAID FOR A HOTEL PERSONALLY NOT. PAIN OR ANYTHING AND- ANYBODY GET THE WRONG IDEA ANYWAYS- FOR THREE DAYS THAT WOULD TAKE HIS DOGS AND WE COULDN'T FIND IN HOUSING WE COULDN'T GET HIM INTO A LOCAL SHELTER BECAUSE HE DID HAVE AN IN THEIR TIME OF THE STILL. WITH HIS ANIMALS AND WHEN I TO HIM HE'S I LOS MY LIFE THEY TOOK MY HOME. AUGUST THE ONLY FAITHFUL THAT I'VE IN MY LIFE FOR. THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO PICKED UP A WEAPON TO DEFEND THIS COUNTRY AND FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM IN KOREA. SO I KNOW THAT HE'S JUST A SMALL EXAMPLE OF. THE COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

FILE ITEM SIXTY SIX THE CENTER PORTANTINO SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY FIVE SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY FIVE BY SENATOR PORTANTINO AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY TAX LEVY CENTER PORTANTINO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SB FORTY FIVE IS A SIMPLE EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT ENTERTAINMENT TAX CREDIT FOR FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS- IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING IN THE NEWS YOU WILL SEE THAT OUR ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS OBVIOUSLY IT WAS CHALLENGED BY. COVERT TEAM BUT IT BACK IN FORCE. AT CAPACITY AND A BIG REASON WHY THAT'S THE CASE IS BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE PRO TEM UNDER HER LEADERSHIP WHEN SHE WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY- PUT TOGETHER A TAX CREDIT. PACKAGE TO HELP THE INDUSTRY IT IS WORKING LAST YEAR WE PASSED. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO NOT JUST CURRENT TAX CREDIT BUT TO CREATE ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES TO BUILD MORE STUDIO. SPACE IN CALIFORNIA AND I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO OUR BUDGET CHAIR FOR WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENED AS WELL. BECAUSE THE MORE CAPACITY WE CAN GENERATE THE MORE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WE CAN CREATE. AND WE TYPICALLY GET CRITICIZED FOR NOT FOCUSING ON MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. THIS TAX CREDIT WILL CREATE AND KEEP AND EXPAND. MIDDLE CLASS PRODUCTION JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHERE THEY BELONG NOT IN OTHER STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

SERAPEUM THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY WHICH AIMS TO IMPROVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BY ESTABLISHING A CLIMATE POLLUTION REDUCTION IN HOMES INITIATIVE. HISTORICALLY OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF POOR AIR QUALITY AND HIGHER ENERGY COST FOR EXAMPLE TWELVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT ACCESS TO PROPERLY VENTILATED APPLIANCES ARE ROUTINELY EXPOSED TO NITROGEN DIOXIDE LEVELS IN THEIR HOMES THAT WOULD EXCEED FEDERAL AND STATE HEALTH BASED STANDARDS. IF FOUND OUTSIDE THE HOME CONSIDERING THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SPENT AN AVERAGE OF FOUR POINT 5% OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME ON ENERGY BILLS ANY COST SAVINGS THAT STATE CAN OFFER WHAT WITH THEM WILL IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR HOMES.
