WE ON MONDAY WE- MANY OF YOU SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY ABOUT A LONG TERM STAFF MEMBER WHO YOU KNOW IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW WITH CANCER. AND HE AND HIS FAMILY I THINK WE'RE ABLE TO ENJOY AND ENJOY MAYBE IS NOT AT LEAST FEEL THE RESPECT THAT THE INSTITUTION GAVE HIM BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO HEAR IT FROM US. WHILE HE WAS STILL WITH US. HI WE DON'T HAVE THAT PRIVILEGE TODAY. AND NEITHER DOES GABE CASWELL OR HIS FAMILY. BECAUSE GABE CASWELL A LONG TERM STAFFER OF THIS INSTITUTION AND CONSULTANT TO BOTH THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE UNEXPECTEDLY AND HE WAS YOUNG. HE HAD A HEART CONDITION HE WAS AWARE OF BUT IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE. WE DIDN'T EXPECT GABE TO PASS UNEXPECTEDLY KNEW HIS DEEP WARMTH AND LOVE GABE HAD A FAMILY OUT OF STATE BUT HERE LOCALLY HE HAD A CHOSEN FAMILY. AND HE ADORED DOT FAMILY ESPECIALLY HIS KIDS WHO HE PARENTED AS IF THEY WERE HIS OWN. AND HE TREATED HIS FRIENDS LIKE FAMILY AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN HERE IN THE BUILDING. WHETHER YOU WERE A LEGISLATOR ADVOCATE STAFF GAVE TREATED YOU WITH RESPECT AND ACCEPTANCE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER HE HAD A DIFFERING OPINION ABOUT THE BILL YOU WERE PITCHING WHERE THE ISSUE YOU'RE ADVOCATING. AND CONSEQUENTLY EVERYONE WHO WORKED WITH HIM LOVED HIM I GAVE. DURING THE FOUR YEARS THAT I CHAIRED THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I NEVER GOT A CALL OF COMPLAINT ABOUT GABE AND- IN THAT COMMITTEE. I FIRST MET GABE WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND HE WAS STAFF TO THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND I WAS ON THAT COMMITTEE. LIKE SO MANY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CHAIR TOM- YANO ALSO LEFT GAVE. ANY POSTED MANY TIMES AFTER GABE'S DEATH. AND ONE OF HIS POSTS DESCRIBE GAVE AS A LOVING AND PROUD GAY FATHER GREAT MINDS AND GREAT SPIRIT. GABE WAS A DEAR FRIEND AND MENTOR TO STAFF THROUGHOUT THIS BUILDING ESPECIALLY SOME OF MY PERSONAL STAFF AND HE WAS VERY CARING TOWARDS HIS PUBLIC SAFETY FELLOWS. ALWAYS WILLING TO EXPLAIN COMPLEX PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES OR HELP A COLLEAGUE OR LEGISLATOR WITH BILL DEVELOPMENT HE LOVED TO THIS INSTITUTION AND EVERYONE IN IT HOW MANY OF OUR STAFF TELL YOU ALMOST DAILY THAT THEY LOVE COMING TO WORK. HE ALWAYS WANTED AND WAS WILLING TO TAKE ON THE HARDEST BILL'S REFORMS OTHERS WERE FREE TO TAKE ON. THE HOT POTATOES THAT IS WE SAY COULD BURN YOU. BUT HAD THOSE POT POTATOES HAD THE GREATEST IMPACT ON IMPROVING JUSTICE AND IMPROVING PEOPLE'S LIVES WHETHER IT WAS THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY POLICE ISSUES ARE SO MUCH MORE. EVERY MAJOR POLICE REFORM PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS PASSED IN THE LAST DECADE. GABE WAS PROHIBITIVELY INVOLVED. FANS EVEN THOUGH THESE WERE REFORMS HE HAD THE RESPECT OF THE VERY ENTITIES THAT USUALLY. A POST THOSE- BILLS ANY HAD AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THEM AND SO YOU REALLY COULD IT ALLOWED PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO CARRIED THOSE COMPLEX BILLS TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH BECAUSE THERE WAS TRUST. BETWEEN THE ENTITIES EVEN WHEN THEY OPPOSE THE BILLS AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF GABE'S RELATIONSHIP HE HELPED THREAD THE NEEDLE ON DIFFICULT ISSUES HE BALANCE DUE PROCESS WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AND HE MADE SURE THAT THE VOICES OF IT IMPACTED PEOPLE. WERE HURT. HE WAS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER HE ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH BUT HE BROUGHT LEVITY TO EVERYTHING. TO EVERY NEGOTIATION HIS COMEDIC TIMING AND HIS PLAYFUL SARCASM WAS IMMEDIATELY DISARMING. HIS LAUGH WAS INFECTIOUS AND ANY OF YOU WHO WERE IN IS TEXTING CIRCLING HIS TEXTS WERE LEGENDARY YOU KNOW HE WAS QUICK WITH THE FUNNY MEMES. AS SOME OTHER PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE BUT HE WAS REALLY QUICK WITH THEM. THIS IS THE KIND OF MESSAGE THAT I RECEIVED FROM COUNTLESS PEOPLE WHO WORKED WITH GAVE PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION. I MISS HIM SO MUCH I THINK ABOUT HIS LAUGH EVERY DAY SOMETIMES BY JUST REPLAY VIDEO WITH HIS LAUGHTER BECAUSE IT'S SO INFECTIOUS I'M HONORED THAT WE GOT TO DO THE GROUND BREAKING WORK THAT WE DID TOGETHER I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE WORK WE ACCOMPLISHED AND I REMEMBER IT FONDLY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE THAT WAS A STAFF MEMBER WHO WORKED WITH HIM IN THE PAST. GABE'S LEGACY LIVES ON THROUGH THE WORK HE HAS DONE TO PROVIDE COUNTLESS PEOPLE SECOND CHANCES. AND IN A SPECIFIC SITUATION THAT COMES TO MIND. GAMES WORK IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RE SENTENCING AND RELEASE OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS NOW A NEW PARENT. AND AS A THRIVING MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY. THAT NEW LIFE THAT BABY BORN FROM THE SITUATION IS A PART OF GABE'S LEGACY. CABLE LIVE ON IN SO MANY OF OUR HEARTS HE IS TRULY LOVED AND WILL BE MISSED FOREVER.

THEIR HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE CONTRIBUTED TO RAISING THE ISSUE OF MODERN DAY HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND MODERN DAY SLAVERY. THEY FOUGHT FOR THEMSELVES AND ALSO FOR REFORMS IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY DOES END SWEATSHOP ABUSES. BECAUSE OF THEIR DEDICATION TO CHANGING THE SYSTEM THE TV SET WAS INTRODUCED TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS A NEW TOOL TO HELP PROSECUTE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS.

SHE SAID I'M PRETTY RUTHLESS ABOUT GETTING THINGS DONE I WORKED THE SYSTEM BUT YOU WON'T ACTUALLY SEE ME BECAUSE I'M DOING IT. AMONG THE HIGH PROFILE BILL SHE AUTHORED- MEASURES DEFINED CAREER ORIENTED HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIES TO BAN TOXIC CHEMICALS IN FLAME RETARDANTS. AND IMPOSED A NO LEAD STANDARDS FOR DRINKING WATER PIPES AND FIXTURES BECAUSE HER CITY OF OAKLAND THAT SHE REPRESENTED HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST LEAD CONTAMINATION RATES AMONGST CHILDREN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WILMA WAS ALSO KNOWN AROUND THE CAPITOL FOR HER LOVE OF LITTLE THINGS SUCH AS LONG NAPS NEW YORK TIMES CROSSWORD PUZZLES AND GET DIAPER CHOCOLATES. WHEN SHE WAS TURNED OUT LIKE I MENTIONED SHE RAN AGAIN FOR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WAS ELECTED. AND SERVED A NAP UNTIL HER UNTIMELY DEATH. HER MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THAT BOARD INCLUDED BEING INSTRUMENTAL IN SAVING SAN LEANDRO HOSPITAL FROM CLOSURE. FOR PUSHING TO ENSURE THE ALAEDA COUNTY WAS FIRST IN LINE FOR TOBACCO TAX MONEY TO HELP FUND PROGRAMS FOR PRESCHOOL CHILDREN. AND WORKING TO EXPAND IN SCHOOL HEALTH CLINICS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN SHE LED THE EFFORT TO PUT A BALLOT MEASURE ON THE BALLOT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FOR LITTLE CHILDREN. AND FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH PROGRAMS ALAMEDA COUNTY VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED IT AT THE TIME OF HER PASSING WILMA WAS THE ONLY WOMAN ON OUR- ALAMEDA COUNTY BIRD OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE ONLY ASIAN AMERICAN. SHE WAS A POWERHOUSE IN THE BAY AREA'S ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND A LEADER IN MENTORING AND SUPPORTING AN S. S. FIRING. API POLITICAL LEADERS DISTRIBUTED AT WILLIS MEMORIAL. THE ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN LABOR ALLIANCE SAID HER LEADERSHIP AND HER EFFORTS TO UPLIFT IMMIGRANTS CHILDREN WOMEN AND LOW WAGE WORKERS WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY THOSE WHO SHE IMPACTED WITH HER PERSEVERANCE. TO ADDRESS SOCIETY'S STRUCTURAL RACISM AND HER FIGHT FOR EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. HE NEVER ENVISIONED GROWING UP THAT SHE WOULD BECOME A PUBLIC ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICIAL BAND IF YOU SEE THE VIDEO THAT WAS ON HER COUNTY WEBSITE. SHE SAID IN IT I DON'T THINK I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. BUT THEN SHE MET MANY PEOPLE WHO ENCOURAGED HER TO RUN AND SERVE THEY TOLD HER YOU HAVE A PASSION FOR THIS WE NEED YOU TO REPRESENT US. AT HER MEMORIAL LAST MONTH HER SON DARREN CHAN SAID. OUR MOM ONCE SAID. HER LEGACY WAS TO MAKE. LIFE A LITTLE BETTER FOR PEOPLE LESS FORTUNATE. AND THAT'S WHAT A MEANINGFUL LIFE IS ONE LIVES NOT JUST FOR ONESELF BUT FOR ONE'S COMMUNITY IT IS CLEAR MORE THAN EVER THAT WILMA CERTAINLY FULFILLED HER LEGACY. AND WE ARE ALSO VERY FORTUNATE THAT SHE DID. SYNERGY FOR. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT WOULD JOIN WITH MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY SHARE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. JUST ADDING A FEW REMARKS I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH IN TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO. TO WORK WITH WILMA SHE WHO WAS. AT THE TIME WE MADE HER THE MAJORITY WHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SUBSEQUENTLY UNDER MISTER WESSON BECAUSE OF HIS SKILL SET SHE WAS PART OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. AND WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE VOICES THAT WE SEE IS ARE AMONG OUR COLLEAGUES ALWAYS YOUR HOMEWORK. SO SUBTLE. THE SUGGESTION WAS ALWAYS PASSIONATE. AND NOT SOMEBODY TRY TO GRAB ATTENTION AND HEADLINES BUT SOMEONE WHO JUST WANTED TO GET THE WORK DONE. I WAS SUCH A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY THAT SHE PASSED SO YOUNG.
