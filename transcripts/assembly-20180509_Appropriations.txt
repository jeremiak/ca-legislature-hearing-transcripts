GETTING PEOPLE ON BEHALF OF THE LONG BEACH COLLECTORS ASSOCIATION IN SPORT. ANNIE JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND SPORT. ARE THERE ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. MORNING. BILLION LEGALLY. FORMER CURRICULAR CURRICULA DEVELOPER SCIENTIFIC ILLUSTRATOR INSTRUCTORS HAVEN'T CISCO SPCA CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. WE'VE BEEN MAKING RATIO SPECIFIC AND CONDITION SPECIFIC CANNABIS BASED FORMULAS FOR OVER A DECADE WORKING WITH VETERINARIANS RESEARCHERS AND PHYSICIANS. TO FURTHER RESPONSIBLE ADMINISTRATION OF CANNABIS MEDICINE TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN IS NEEDED LEGISLATION BUT AS WRITTEN IT DOES NOTHING. TO EDUCATE VETERINARIANS NOR DOES IT FURTHER RESEARCH AND POSES AN UNDUE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE CVM BE. THERE IS NO RECREATIONAL USE OF CANNABIS FOR ANIMALS DOGS IN PARTICULAR HAVE MORE CANNABINOID RECEPTORS THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL INCLUDING HUMANS. STAFF AND DISPENSARIES ARE UNTRAINED IN ADMINISTRATION OF CANNABIS BASED MEDICINES FOR ANIMALS THE ONLY PROTECTION THAT WAS INCLUDED IN TWENTY TWO FIFTEENS LANGUAGE. WAS THE CABBIE AT THE VETERINARY CANNABIS BE AVAILABLE IN MEDICAL DISPENSARIES ONLY LET LANGUAGE WAS STRUCK AFTER TWO FIFTEEN PASSED THE BNP COMMITTEE. THAT'S MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION WE STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE UNTIL TWO FIFTEEN IS AMENDED WITH STRUGGLE LANGUAGE PROTECTING ANIMALS EDUCATING VETERINARIANS AND GIVING VETERINARIANS THE ABILITY TO RECOMMEND THANK YOU. YEAH. THE LOCAL HAND. PAUL HANDS VERY LOVINGLY LEGALLY. WE'VE BEEN DOING WORKING WITH RESEARCHERS DOCTORS FOR OVER A DECADE SUPPLYING OF MEDICAL CANNABIS. MEDICINE FOR SEVERELY ILL. PATIENTS. FOR THE LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE. WE HAVE MET WITH THE OF VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS WE'VE SPOKEN WITH THE AUTHOR. EXISTS AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL AS WRITTEN THAT PROTECTS THIS IS THE SAFETY OF ANIMALS. IT DOES NOTHING TO FURTHER THAT THE PROFESSION OF VETERINARY. IT DOES NOTHING TO FURTHER RESEARCH. PEOPLE NEED THE RESEARCH THEY NEED A BODY OF EVIDENCE THIS IS ONE WAY TO GET A DOCUMENT A BODY OF EVIDENCE BY. ALLOWING THE VETERINARIANS TO OF TO RECOMMEND AND ALSO TO. HOW THE OF RECOMMENDATION FOR IN ORDER TO PURCHASE THESE VETERINARY? THINGS THE VETERINARIAN MEDICAL CANNABIS. WE HAVE MET WITH THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD IT BACK IN DECEMBER THEY HAD EMERGENCY TELECONFERENCE A BOARD MEETING. IN ORDER TO RAISE THEIR FEES BECAUSE IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THE THE STATEMENT THAT IS MINOR COST DUE TO THE CONTINGENCY FUND I THINK THAT THE THEIR FOR THEIR OF FISCAL OF. POSITION IS IS STRAINED AS IT IS AND THEY WOULD HAVE LIKELY HAVE TO HIRE. RESEARCHERS LAWYERS AND CONSULTANTS BECAUSE BY AND LARGE THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD KNOWS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MEDICAL CANNABIS. SO IN ORDER TO DO THEIR WORK EFFECTIVELY THAT WOULD HAVE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE. I THINK OF WE HAVE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY BEEN VETTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL THAT WOULD FIT PLUG FIT INTO THIS QUITE. READILY IN CRATE QUITE EASILY INCLUDING CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR THE VETERINARIANS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE QUALIFIED TO RECOMMEND. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT OF WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL AND LISTEN LANGUAGES. INCLUDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THEIR THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. PART IN FINANCE NO FILE THANK YOU. MISTER KALRA ARE YOU COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. WE DIDN'T WORK WITH EVERYONE. THAT THE BEST WE CAN. THEIR DIVERSE OPINION. AS TO HOW TO PROCEED. BUT PROBABLY THE WORKING MOSTLY WITH THE BOARD AS WELL AS MEDICAL THE VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS THE VETERINARIANS THANK YOU. MR CRACK ARM. I JUST LIKE TO GET HER. TO SAY THAT I'M CERTAINLY VOTING FOR TODAY ON FINANCIAL GRANTS HOWEVER. I DO ONE UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE BEHIND THIS AND IF THE VARIOUS PARTIES CAN MEET WITH ME I'D BE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT MORE THANK YOU. THE CAPE MISTER BIGELOW HAS QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA. CAN READ THE BILL I'M KIND OF CURIOUS. EXPLAIN TO US HOW AND WHAT PRODUCT WILL BE USED. IN A BENEFICIAL WAY AND WHAT WHAT TYPE OF USE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THE THE USE OF CANNABIS ON ON ANIMALS REALLY. BUT LIMIT CERTAIN FOLKS ON CBD WHICH IS THE MEDICINAL COMPONENT OF CANNABIS NOT TEENAGE SEE. WHICH IS THE COMPONENT THAT CREATES THE HIGH. AND SO THERE IS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DONE. IN WORKING WITH THIS BILL WE ARE. WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH IN FACT. OF WILL CONTINUE TO BE CASA CONTACT WITH RESEARCHERS AND THIS BILL DOES. THAT PART OF THE BILL IS TO PERSONAL ALLOW VETERINARIANS TO LEAST DISCUSS WHAT THEIR PATIENT OWNERS CANNABIS AYE IT'S UP THE VETERINARIAN TO WANT TO DO THAT. EYES SO. THERE'S NO. THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MUST BUT IN ADDITION IT IT COULD DIED OF THE BOARD TO CREATE GUIDELINES AND SAW THAT WOULD ALLOW GOING FORWARD. TO USE THE SCIENCE THE RESEARCH AS IT IS ONGOING RESEARCH TO ENSURE THAT WHEN SOMEONE GOES IN DISPENSED ME THERE'S ACTUALLY GUIDANCE FOR THE DISPENSARY. AS TO. WHAT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADMITTED TO? THE PAINT TO PET OWNERS AND SO ABSOLUTELY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE REASON WHY THIS BILL I WAS PUT FORWARD. WISE IN ORDER TO CREATE SOME KIND OF BASIS. AS OPPOSED TO NOT HAVING ANY RULES AT ALL. AYE AND CERTAINLY TO REMOVE LIABILITY FOR VETERINARIANS WHO HAVE NO ABILITY TO EVEN DISCUSS CANNABIS WITH THEIR PATIENT OWNERS SOBER MOOD LIABILITY WORK TOWARDS CREATING THE GUIDELINES AND ALLOW DISPENSARIES TO DISPENSE AT AND I THINK THAT THOSE THAT COMBINATION OF THOSE THREE THINGS. BROADBAND CHILE JUST AS THE BELT THAT THE BUREAU RIGHT NOW IS PUTTING TOGETHER THESE GUIDELINES THIS. OF. THIS GUIDANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE WILL ALLOW THE BUREAU TO IN ADDITION. THAT IN ADDITION TO THE WORK IT'S DOING IN TERMS OF HUMAN USE ALLOW THEM TO ALSO WORK WITH THE VETERINARY BOARD THAT OF VETERINARY MEDICINE UP OF. TO ENSURE THAT IF THE SUSPENSE RESPONSIBLY BECAUSE OF COURSE IT CAN ONLY BE DISPENSED FOR MEDICAL AILMENTS O. FOR PATIENT HONORS IN THE REASON WHY. IT WAS MOVED FROM THE MEDICINAL TO THE RECREATIONAL IS THAT A PET CAN GET A MEDICAL CANNABIS CARD. AND SO IS THE CREDIT THAT THIS WAS TO THE SUGGESTION OF THE BMP COMMITTEE PUBLIC CHAIR LOW AND AND TE STAFF DOING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK. THAT IT WAS MOVED TO THE RECREATIONAL AT THIS IS NOT ABOUT PETS GETTING RECREATIONAL USE OF CANNABIS AT ALL. RIGHT UNDERSTANDING THAT FROM THE MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE BUT THERE'S ONLY SEVERAL WAYS THAT AN ANIMAL CAN. THE AFFECTED BY THIS ONE IS EITHER THROUGH A SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION TO FROM AN INTRAMUSCULAR THREE FROM OUR A NASAL MIST OR ORAL A ADMINISTRATION THOSE ARE THE ONLY METHODS. OF THAT YOU CAN REALLY IF I GET THIS PRODUCT AND SITE THOSE ALL REQUIRED FTA LEVEL OF APPROVAL WITH CERTIFICATION THAT THE PRODUCT IS HEALTHY AND SAFE. FOR THE. AND ANIMAL THAT'S BEING. USE FOR THIS UNLESS WE'RE GOING TO USE SOME KIND OF FORM OF LIKE A SCOOBY SNACK YOU KNOW WE PUT IT INSIDE. STUFF TO MAKE FUN OF IT IS JUST THEN TOOK BECAUSE SAVE THE WAY IT IS YOU WOULD PUT IT IN SOMETHING. THAT WOULD BE A TREAT FOR THE ANIMAL WHETHER IT BE DOG CAT WHATEVER TO TO TO INGEST THERE ALSO AND JUST KIND OF CURIOUS HOW WE'RE GONNA HAMLET. WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE FDA WELL FIRST LAWS WONDERING HOW LONG THIS BILL WOULD BE EXISTS FOR SOMEONE ACTUALLY REFERRED TO SCOOBY SNACKS. BUT I'D THAT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE A THAT YOU'RE CORRECT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU COULD CERTAINLY GET AN ANIMAL TO INJUSTICE BUT THERE ALSO ARE. LOTIONS AND AND AND POTIONS LOTIONS AND SUCH FOR EXTERNAL USE FOR MUSCLE ACHES WHAT HAVE YOU. ADAPTING SAID THE FDA OF COURSE HASN'T. APPROVED OF CANNABIS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT OF. THE STATE. BASED UPON NOT JUST WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT FORWARD BUT BASED UPON THE VOTE OF THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. HAS. ALLOWED HIM FOR AT LEAST A STATE REPORT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THIS TENSION THAT EXISTS EVEN FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND SO. THIS IN NO WAY AND THAT'S WHY MAKE IT COULD THIS IN NO WAY REQUIRES A VETERINARIAN. MY TO DISCUSS THIS WITH PATIENT OWNERS OR NOR IS A REQUIRE DISPENSARY TO SELL FOR. OF ANIMAL USE BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS THAT RISK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOWEVER YOU KNOW I STILL REMAIN OPTIMISTIC THAT AT SOME POINT FTA. ALL WORLD OF. BUT WILL BE MORE OF A POSITIVE IN A SERB. MILITIA SHIP WITH BUT STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT ALLOW FOR SO I I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE IT READS. PLEASE US INTO THE NEXT LEVEL OF QUESTIONS YOU KNOW THERE'S A. A FEDERAL LAW. THAT REQUIRES A WITHDRAWAL PERIOD FOR ALL PRESCRIBED MEDICINES AND IF YOU'RE SELLING LIVESTOCK AND YOU'VE TREATED IT. LIKE IF YOU TREATED WITH A ANTIBIOTIC IN A RECENT YEAH YOU HAVE TO WAIT TWENTY EIGHT DAYS BEFORE YOU CAN SELL THAT ANIMAL OR IT CAN BE PROCESSED TO GOING TO THE FOOD CHAIN. OR BE UTILIZED. SOME PEOPLE IF THEY'RE STARTING TO USE THIS NOW THEY'RE USING OUTLOOK JUST LIKE LAMBS OR HAIG'S OR CATTLE. YEAH IT. COULD VERY EASILY GET INTO THE FOOD STREAM IF THERE'S NO REGULATORY STATUTE. TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THIS AND PEOPLE COULDN'T JUST THAT. AND BE AFFECTED SO I THINK THERE'S SOME CURIOSITY HERE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME STANDARDS. THAT WAY AND AT LEAST HAVE A RECOGNITION. OF WHAT THOSE IMPACTS MIGHT BE. I I DO WANT TO POINT OUT I APPRECIATE WESLEYAN AND I THINK IF SOME OF THESE ISSUES MIGHT OF I DON'T I DON'T WATCH BMP I DON'T HAVE THESE ISSUES WERE BROUGHT UP. IT COULD AFFECT THE COST BUT I DO WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT. THIS COMMITTEE REALLY IS MAKING A DECISION BASED ON ON THE FISCAL ANALYSIS SO BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS I HAVE SOME OF THE SAME SO. WITH THAT I THINK MISS CARILLO HAD A QUESTION AND THEN MISS FRIEDMAN. IT WAS YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ONE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO OUR ATTENTION I'M A PET OWNER KNOW SEVERAL. FRIENDS WHO LIVES WHOSE DOGS. SUFFERED FROM CANCER ARTHRITIS AND THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND ENSURING THAT WERE USING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS. FOR SOME OF THESE HUMAN BASS ILLNESSES AND OUR PETS HAVE AND I. LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONVERSATION. ABOUT SOME OF THE LAYOUTS OF MISTER BIGELOW POINTED OUT. IN A POLICY CONVERSATION OUTSIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU THINK. THIS FRIEDMAN. I MEAN YEAH I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL IMPACT BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR. A WITH REGARDS TO THE SAFETY. FOR PETS THANK YOU. THE SUPPORTING TODAY JUST BASED ON FISCAL IMPACTS. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVEN QUALIFIED TO SAY THE SHOULD HAPPEN ACTION HAPPEN SO I HAD THIS IS A DIFFICULT DECISION BUT I I GUESS. WHAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED ASKING US TO DO IS MOVE IT FORWARD SO THAT THAT? VETERINARIANS CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THIS SHOULD BE MOVE FORWARD WHICH I'M MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH AN BE MAKING THAT KIND OF DECISION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IF THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ABSOLUTELY THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE'RE REMOVING AT A PACE THAT ALLOWS THE VETERINARIANS TO ACTUALLY GUIDE US IN THE RESEARCH TO GUIDE US. AND NOT TO MAKE PRESUMPTIONS BUT WE DO KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF ANIMALS DO HAVE THE SAME RECEPTORS THAT ALLOW FOR BENEFITS AND CBD AND AND RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE GIVING. CANNABIS TO THEIR PETS THAT IS DESIGNED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE CANNABIS ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR PET CONSUMPTION WE CANNOT DO THIS WITHOUT. A BIT THAT A BILL OF THIS NATURE GOING FORWARD SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT GETS OUT ON A B. ROLL CALL WITH MR BROKE VOTING BY. TO KALRA. I HAVE DOWN THAT YOU'RE.

CALIFORNIA'S HOME TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND RETIRED VETERANS CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY NINE STATES BUT FULLY TAX RETIREMENT PAY WHILE THIRTY ONE OTHERS DO NOT TAX WILL CALL AT ALL. ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OFFENSE MOST RETIRED VETERANS ARE IN THEIR FORTIES AND READY TO START A SECOND CAREER. CALIFORNIA SEEN A STEADY DECLINE RETIRED VETERANS BECAUSE MANY OF CHOSEN TO RESIDE. IN ANOTHER STATE. MANY RETIRED VETERANS OF HIGH SKILLED JOBS THAT WOULD TRANSITION WELL IN THE CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE HOWEVER KEEPING THE STATUS QUO WILL LOSE OUT ON MANY DOCTORS NURSES LAWYERS ENGINEERS POLICEMEN AND FIREMEN. CALIFORNIA WE STANDS TO GAIN BY THE SANITIZING THESE VETERANS. THEY WILL TAKE HIGH DEMAND AND WELL PAYING JOBS. AND PAY INCOME TAX BY HOMES PAY PROPERTY TAX INCREASE BUSINESS SALES TO PAY SALES TAX THE BENEFITS GO ON. ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND A REPORT BY CALIFORNIA COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS CALIFORNIA RECEIVED OVER SEVEN BILLION IN FEDERAL BENEFITS THERE'S A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IS REQUIRED TO. INSERT INTO A STATE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF VETERANS FOR COMMUNITY CLINICS AND VETERANS HOSPITALS. THE OTHER ASPECT IS SUPPORTING WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S MILITARY COUNCIL RECENTLY REPORTED THAT STATE LEADERS SHOULD EXPLORE APPROPRIATE WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE VETERANS STAY IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF PROVIDING A RETIRED VETERANS WITH THIS BENEFIT AB WENTY THREE NINETY FOR WILL ENCOURAGE MORE RETIREES TO REMAIN HERE.

AYE MYRMIDON WILEY AS HE SAID I'M A RETIRED ASSISTANT U. S. SURGEON GENERAL AND VETERAN OF THE UNITED STATES PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE AND PHYSICIAN. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY DRESSES COMMITTEE REGARDING AB TWENTY THREE FOR NINETY FOUR IS A MUCH NEEDED FEDERAL MILITARY EXEMPTION. THAT WILL ENCOURAGE ME AND MORE RETIRED VETERANS TO STAY IN AND RELOCATE TO CALIFORNIA. DURING MY TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF ACTIVE DUTY I SERVED. SIGNED WITH THE UNITED STATES THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE STATION THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES PROVIDING CARE TO ALASKA NATIVES AND AMERICAN MAYBE PEOPLE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN RESERVATIONS. AND I WORKED AS A REGIONAL CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR IN MY FINAL POSITION. IN THIS LATTER ROLE I PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE AND BECAUSE OF THE OF SERVICES TO MULTIPLE TRIBES LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS AND ALSO. INTERFACE WITH DOD SISTER SERVICES AND SERVICE MEMBERS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. OF NOTE MY FATHER WAS A QUEEN WERE NAVY VETERAN SERVING ALAMEDA NAVAL AIR STATION HE WAS BORN AND RAISED IN CALIFORNIA AND RECENTLY PASSED AWAY. I GREW UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GRADUATE FROM CAL BERKLEY. AND YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO MEDICAL RESIDENCY PROGRAM NOW IS A RETIRED MEDICAL OFFICER I AM A PHYSICIAN.

OTHER VETERANS RETIRED AND ALSO THEIR INDIVIDUAL IN OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL IN OUR COLLECTIVE. CONTRIBUTIONS APPLY. AS PART OF MY RETIREMENT TRANSITION I AM ENGAGE WITH VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS AND SERVICE MEMBERS. USING MY PUBLIC HEALTH MINISTRY OF SKILLS I PLAN TO CONTINUE THIS WORK AND LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO AT RISK POPULATIONS IN PARTICULAR VETERAN WOMEN ELDERS AND AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKA NATIVES. RATHER THE SOLELY FOCUSED ON THE INITIAL FISCAL IMPACT OF LOST REVENUE IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT I AND OTHER RETIRED VETERANS PAY PROPERTY TAXES SALES TAXES GAS TAX. AND LOTS OF OTHER FEES. WE DO REINVEST FINANCIAL TAX SAVINGS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES MOST OF US HAVE OPTIONS WHERE WE CHOOSE TO LIVE. PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHERE I DETECT DECIDE TO PERMANENTLY COSTS OF THE SITE. ANSWER IF I STAY IN CALIFORNIA. AB TWENTY THREE NINETY FOUR DOESN'T AND IF IT DOES NOT PASS I KNOW THAT I CAN GO TO NEIGHBORING STATES LIKE NEVADA AND OREGON WERE TAX ADVANTAGES ARE CRITICAL TO ME AND MY FAMILY. IN FACT MY FATHER MOVED IN ABOUT A IN SEMI RETIREMENT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA WAS TOO EXPENSIVE ANY NEW THE TAX ADVANTAGES. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN MANY POLICY ISSUES PROVIDING OPTIMAL BENEFITS TO RETIRED OF VETERANS IT'S STILL LIKES BEHIND OTHER SERVICES IN THOSE OPTIMAL BENEFITS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO WATCH OTHER STATES EXEMPT MILITARY RETIREMENT PAY VETERANS WILL LEAVE. SO KEY QUESTION IS WHAT WILL THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE DUE TO KEEP ME AND OTHER RETIRED VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA. AB TWENTY THREE NINETY FOUR IS THAT RIGHT STEP TO KEEP US HERE AND ENTICE FUTURE VETERANS TO COME TO CALIFORNIA AND MAKE THIS GREAT STATE THEIR HOME.
