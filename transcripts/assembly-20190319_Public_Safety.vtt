00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.019
ETHICALLY OF COURSE HAS SOME.

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:58.990
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE --

00:35:59.056 --> 00:36:01.225

BUT TOWARDS THE ROAD APPROACH

00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:26.150
THAT WILL RESULT IN A GREATER

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:28.085
USE OF PRIVATE COUNSEL IN A

PROSECUTORS WHO DO THEIR JOB

00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:07.959

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:16.000
UNDER CURRENT LAW A VICTIM IS

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.001

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:45.997
BECAUSE IT PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE.

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:48.065
FOR SOME UNSCRUPULOUS LAWYERS TO

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:49.266

AND THEY NOTIFY THE VICTIMS WHEN

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.004
THERE'S GOING TO BE A COURT

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:29.206

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:54.999
SO THIS IS WORK THAT IS ALREADY

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:58.002
PAID FOR IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:01.138

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:13.017
IN THIS --

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:14.051
SCHEME OF THINGS.

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:16.253
AND THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.023
FUND AS URINALYSIS ALREADY SHOWS

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.058
IS SERIOUSLY BEING DEPLETED.

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:24.095
THIS WOULD BE AN ADDED EXPENSE.

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:26.197
THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE BORNE

00:39:26.263 --> 00:39:29.033
BY THE EITHER THE TAXPAYERS

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.036

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:44.048

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.282
OF THE CALLER REPLIED YES MISTER

BUT THE DEFENSE DOES HAVE A VERY

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:53.023
GOOD POINT ABOUT THE VICTIMS

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.026
COMPENSATION FUND WHICH IS NOT

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:57.261

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.095
OUR PROBLEM.

00:39:58.162 --> 00:40:04.001
BECAUSE IT IS DEPLETING AND

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:05.136
CUTTING OFF ITS SOURCE OF INCOME

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:06.237
TO BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT --

00:40:06.303 --> 00:40:07.338
IT'S UNFAIR TO PENALIZE PEOPLE

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:09.340
FISCALLY BUT WE HAVE TO FIND

00:40:09.406 --> 00:40:10.040

SO IT IS A LEGITIMATE THING THAT

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:17.047
I THINK WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH.

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:18.015

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.125
HIGHLIGHT OBVIOUSLY IS THAT FROM

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:24.027
DRUG POLICIES PERSPECTIVE --

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:25.228
WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:27.264
A RACIAL AND A CIVIL RIGHTS

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.065
ISSUE.

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:30.033
WE KNOW THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.034
HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:33.203
HITTING ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.005
PARTICULARLY BLACK AND LATINO

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:36.173

00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:39.209
AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE REALLY.

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:41.244
BELIEVE THAT GIVING JUDGES THE

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:43.080
DISCUSSION --

00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:44.114
TO OUT.

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:47.184
IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS OR HAVE

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.218
THAT DISCRETION --

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:51.021
WOULD HELP REDUCE THE THE IMPACT

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:52.155
THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS HAD ON

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:54.091
ON THESE COMMUNITIES --

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:56.993
AND THEN JUST REALLY QUICKLY --

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.095
TO COOK MICHELLE ALEXANDER ON

00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:02.999

00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:05.001
NOTHING HAS CONTRIBUTED MORE

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:09.005

VERY COSTLY BOTH AT THE STATE

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:18.181

I THINK ALL OF US IN IN RESPONSE

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:55.978
TO A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS WANT TO

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.179
FIND WAYS TO KEEP IT FROM

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:59.081
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE --

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:02.051
UNFORTUNATELY INCREASING THE

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.352
SENTENCES FOR FOR FLEEING THE

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.187

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.022
THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS OR

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:10.025
INJURIES FROM CAR ACCIDENTS.

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:11.994
OR EVEN TO TURN DRIVERS FROM

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.195
FLEEING THE SCENE AFTER AN

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:14.063
ACCIDENT --

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:16.999
INSTEAD IT TIES JUDGES HANDS SO

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:18.067
THAT THEY ARE FORCED TO IMPOSE

01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:20.035
PRISON SENTENCES IN.

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:21.370
THE CASES WHERE THOSE SENTENCES

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:24.139
MAYBE LEAST APPROACH MORE PEOPLE

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:26.075
TO PRISON FOR LONGER PERIODS OF

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:27.009
TIME -- AND

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:29.111
UNFORTUNATELY WITH LITTLE OR NO

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.046
BENEFIT TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

WITH STAFF AND IT IS TRUE.

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.148
THAT IF YOU WERE DRUNK AND YOU

FROM AS A MOTHER.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:15.017
OF YOUNG KIDS AS WELL I CAN'T

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:16.251
IMAGINE THE PAIN THAT YOU'VE

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.553
BEEN THROUGH IN THE LAST EIGHT

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:19.087
MONTHS AND I SO APPRECIATE YOU

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:20.322

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:31.200
HAVE IMPORTANT POINTS TO RAISE

01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:33.035
THEIR AGREE JUST CIRCUMSTANCES

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.136
LIKE THE ONES DESCRIBED HERE

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:36.038
WERE EIGHT YEARS IS ABSOLUTELY

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:37.172
PERHAPS WITH THE JUDGE IN THIS

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:38.240
SEARCH ATTORNEY WOULD FIND

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.075
APPROPRIATE AND WE SHOULD.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.276
CONSIDER RAISING THE PENALTY IN

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:42.411
THAT CASE I ALSO HEAR WHAT

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:43.278
YOU'RE SAYING.

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:45.280
NOT EVERY CASE IN THE CRIMINAL

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:47.082
SYSTEM IS THE SAME RIGHT AND

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.116
THEY'RE SITUATIONS THAT ARE LESS

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:49.251
EGREGIOUS THAN THE ONE PRESENTED

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.052
HERE TODAY.

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:51.186
AND IN THOSECASES MAYBE TWO

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:53.055
YEARS IS APPROPRIATE.

01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:54.056
SO I AM.

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:56.158
IN A PLACE WHERE I SEE THE MAYBE

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.192
THERE IS AN IN BETWEEN WHICH IS

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:59.027
TO KEEP THE FLOOR IT TWO YEARS

01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:00.495
BUT TO RAISE IT TO EIGHT YEARS

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:02.364
AS A TOP PENALTY AND I DON'T

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:03.365
KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'D

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:07.035
BE OPEN TO MR PATERSON BUT I'M --

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:08.203
YOU KNOW I'M SORT OF WITH MISTER

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.204
QUIRK RIGHT NOW WHERE THAT

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:11.006
SOMETHING I WOULD ACTUALLY

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:11.607
CONSIDER BECAUSE I THINK THERE

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:12.074
ARE CASES.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.109
LIKE MRS GLIDING'S WHERE EIGHT

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.043
YEARS.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.212
IS RIGHT BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:18.981
TO TAKE THE DISCRETION AWAY FROM

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.015
THOSE IN THE SYSTEM TO USED

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:21.116
HERE'S WHERE THE CASE IS VERY

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:23.018
DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE DESCRIBED

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:23.185
SO.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:26.221
I PUT THAT TO YOU [inaudible]

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:27.055
KAMLAGER-DOVE.

I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:33.095
AND SHARING YOUR STORY AND FOR

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:34.029
BRINGING --

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.998
HIS RELATIVES AND HIS FRIENDS

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:40.068
AND PEOPLE WHO LOVE THEM. TO

01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:42.170
KEEP HIS MEMORY AND KEEP HIS

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:44.206
LIFE ALIVE I AM [inaudible]

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:46.041
IT IS.

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:49.011
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE --

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:51.046
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:54.016
THAT PERSON WHO KILLED YOUR

01:15:54.082 --> 01:15:55.284
HUSBAND HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:58.053
DECENCY.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.155
AND TO RUN AND THEN TRIED TO

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:03.058
COVER IT UP.

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:04.259
WHATEVER COURAGE HE MAY HAVE HAD.

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:07.029
WAS DEPLETED.

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:10.032
IN THAT INSTANCE.

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:13.001
AND LIKE MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES I

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:15.103
TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS I HAVE

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:18.073
CONCERNS WITH WHEN WE TRY TO

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.209
ENHANCE PUNISHMENTS [inaudible]

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:23.045
NOT.

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:25.013
UNDERSTANDING THAT UNINTENDED

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.348
CONSEQUENCES TO OTHER KINDS OF

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.216
FOLKS HAPPEN IN THE PENDULUM

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:30.152
BEGINS TO SWING OTHER WAYS IN

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:31.253
WAYS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.055
IMPACT OTHER FOLKS.

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:35.023
WHO WHO HAVE DIFFERENT STORIES

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:36.325
LIKE SOME OF THE STORIES THAT

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:37.092
WERE SHARED --

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:39.027
BY -- THE

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:43.031
WOMEN HERE I I THINK THAT --

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:46.068
JUDGES DO HAVE DISCRETION.

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:49.037
AND THEY HAVE MULTIPLE TOOLS AT

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:51.106
THEIR DISPOSAL WITH THE LAW TO

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:54.109
STACK SENTENCES ON TOP OF ONE

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:56.211
ANOTHER TO TRY TO GET THE KIND

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.046
OF PUNISHMENT.

01:16:58.113 --> 01:16:59.982
FOLKS FEEL --

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:03.018
IS WORTHY --

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:04.186
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:06.054
THOSE KINDS OF CRIMES AND I

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:08.056
THINK HIT AND RUNS ARE.

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:11.026
ALSO VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.060
THEY ARE.

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:14.096
LEFT OPEN TO INTERPRETATION BY

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:16.164
BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BY

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:17.065
PROSECUTORS.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.234
SOME WILL INTERPRET GOING THREE

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.136
BLOCKS VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:23.105
GOING FIVE MILES VERY

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:24.239
DIFFERENTLY FROM GOING HOME AND

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.208
TRYING TO YOU KNOW FIX UP A

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:28.043
BANGED UP CAR.

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:30.979
AND SO HOW WE RECTIFY SOME OF

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:32.080
THOSE NUANCES --

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.016
THAT CAN ONCE AGAIN

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:35.017
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:36.418
CERTAIN FOLKS WHO HAVE ALREADY

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:39.021
BEEN HIT BY THE SENTENCE

01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:40.022
ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE HAVE PUT

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:41.323
FORTH OVER THE COURSE OF THE

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:42.057
YEARS.

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:44.092

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:48.030
INTERESTED IN TRYING TO CORRECT

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.998
WITH A MUCH MORE LASER FOCUS

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:52.067

COLLEAGUES THAT I WOULD BE OPEN

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:58.006

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:45.053
LEGISLATIVE INTENT.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.388
AND THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.057
ASPECT OF LEGISLATION.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:50.525
AND I WOULD CHALLENGE THIS

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:52.094
COMMITTEE AND EVERYBODY ASSIGNED

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.196
TO THIS COMMITTEE. TO THINK

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:57.065
ABOUT LEGISLATIVE INTENT.

01:18:57.132 --> 01:19:00.235
AND ARE WE HERE. TO ALLOW FOR

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:03.038
ACCOUNTABILITY TO BE CARRIED OUT.

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:05.373
OR WE HEAR TO ALWAYS SYMPATHIZED

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.042
WITH THE FENDERS.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:10.045
IT GETS VERY VERY TIRESOME.

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:12.013
AND I'D I DON'T SAY THAT IT'S

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.049
NOT NORMAL TO BE SYMPATHETIC.

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:17.052
BUT WHEN YOU.

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:19.087
HAVE SOMEBODY THE EXPERIENCE THE

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.123
TRAGEDY ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:23.058
NEEDLESS DEATH.

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.060
CHANGES THE PICTURE.

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:27.062
I WOULD HOPE.

IN ARGUABLE.

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.234
AND UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE START

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.002
TALKING ABOUT THESE VERY

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:37.038
DELICATE ISSUES.

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:38.440
VICTIMS ARE REALLY REALLY ARE

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:41.042
FORGOTTEN.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.144
WITH WE TALK ABOUT VICTIMS'

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:43.378
FAMILIES BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.046
AT THEM.

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:46.381
WHAT TO LOOK AT THE VICTIM

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:47.215
THEY'RE GONNA [inaudible]

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:50.051
THAT'S SHAMEFUL.

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:53.054
THAT SHAMEFUL THE WE DISCOUNT.

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.289
THE TRAGEDIES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:57.025
LOSS OF LIFE.

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:59.060
IN THIS I AM SO SORRY.

BUT WE COULD DO A LITTLE BIT OF

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:04.032
SOMETHING THAT MEANS A GREAT

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.066
DEAL.

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:08.003

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:31.293
PEOPLE PUT A LOT OF TRUST IN US

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:35.030
ON THIS COMMITTEE. TO ACTUALLY

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:47.042

WE'RE BETRAYING THAT TRUST.

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.212

THE PRESIDENT HIT AND RUN

01:26:53.107 --> 01:26:54.008
[inaudible]

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:55.243
CULTURE [inaudible]

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:59.047
AND IF WE HAD THIS LAW ON THE

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.281
BOOKS AND IF WE HAD THE

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.250
OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE.

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:04.252
THE INFORMATION THROUGH THE

THIS IS AN ENHANCEMENT.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.212
WE ARGUE THAT THIS IS NOTHING

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:35.049
MORE THAN PUTTING PARITY IN.

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:16.036
THE INCLUSION OF A SUSPECTED

01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:18.005
HATE IS INCIDENT IS ALSO

01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:19.072
SIGNIFICANT.

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:21.041
THESE HATE INCIDENTS PROVIDE

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:22.109

TRACKING THEM CAN ALSO AID IN

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.185
CRIME PREVENTION AS HATE

01:41:31.251 --> 01:41:33.020

01:41:35.155 --> 01:41:36.323
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY I

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:39.059
HATE CRIMES ARE UNDER REPORTED.

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:40.327

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:42.095
LACK OF SUFFICIENT AWARENESS OF

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.263
THE POSSIBILITY THAT ONE HAS

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:45.065
EVEN OCCURRED.

EQUIPPED TO INVESTIGATE THE

POSSIBILITY WHEN THERE IS

01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:54.308

INFORMATION FROM THE REPORT.

01:46:33.153 --> 01:46:34.287
AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:36.022
BUT ADDING THIS DUPLICATIVE

01:46:36.089 --> 01:46:37.057
REQUIREMENT.

PERCEIVED BIAS IN WHAT HAPPENED.

SEE WHAT THIS REALLY SOLVES IT'S

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:53.573
DUPLICATIVE IT'S GONNA TAKE

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.107
RESOURCES.

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:56.276
AWAY FROM OTHER THINGS AND FOR

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:58.145
THOSE REASONS WERE POSTED CLICK

01:46:58.211 --> 01:46:59.079
THANK YOU SIR.

01:46:59.146 --> 01:47:00.013

OPPOSITION.

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:03.483
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:04.050
MEMBERS.

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:05.185
MISS COLORADO.

THANK YOU SO I AM --

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:09.055
GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:10.390
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESTATE

01:47:10.457 --> 01:47:12.025
THAT IT IS REALLY ABOUT

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:14.127
REPORTING WE KNOW THAT HATE

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:15.362
CRIMES JUST LIKE DOMESTIC

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:16.062
TERRORISM.

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:18.165
ARE ON THE RISE AND YET

01:47:18.231 --> 01:47:19.065
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:47:19.132 --> 01:47:23.069
IT IS INCREDIBLY HARD.

01:47:23.136 --> 01:47:25.038
THAT THERE'S MOTIVATION AND

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:27.040
INTENT TO HARM A PROTECTED CLASS

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:28.141
YOU KNOW AND PROSECUTORS DON'T

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:30.143
WANT TO RUN THE RISK OF LOSING A

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:32.078
CASE ARE LOSING ACCOUNT.

01:47:32.145 --> 01:47:33.146
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE EDUCATION

01:47:33.213 --> 01:47:34.314
THAT HAS TO GO IN ON THE FRONT

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:36.183
END IN TERMS OF EDUCATING JURORS

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:38.418
ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW A PROTECTED

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:40.053
CLASS IS.

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.989
HOW YOU MEASURE INTENDS AND THEN

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:44.157
WHAT THE APPROPRIATE CHARGE

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:45.058
SHOULD BE?

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:48.995
RIGHT SO MY HOPE IS THAT.

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:52.032
IF WE ARE BEGINNING TO INTEGRATE

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:54.067
THIS KIND OF REPORTING.

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:55.135
THAT THAT WILL HELP WITH

01:47:55.202 --> 01:47:57.170
EDUCATION ON THE BACKEND FOR LAW

01:47:57.237 --> 01:47:59.206
ENFORCEMENT TO BECOME BETTER

01:47:59.272 --> 01:48:01.208
AWARE ABOUT WHAT DOMESTIC

01:48:01.274 --> 01:48:03.310
TERRORISM LOOKS LIKE ABOUT WHAT

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:05.178
THIS DOES NOT FOCUS ON THAT I

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:07.013
KNOW I'M JUST ADDING A LITTLE

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.114
EXTRA -- BUT

01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:10.050
ABOUT WHAT DOMESTIC TERRORISM

01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:11.384
LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT HATE CRIMES

01:48:11.451 --> 01:48:14.054
LOOK LIKE SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:17.023
TO ATTACK THE BIAS THAT'S IN OUR

01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:18.325
OWN JUDGMENT AS IT RELATES TO

01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:20.293
COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THESE

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:22.062
KINDS OF PERPETRATORS.

01:48:22.128 --> 01:48:24.064
AND ALSO HOW WE BEGIN TO CHANGE

01:48:24.130 --> 01:48:26.233
THE LAWS AS IT RESULTS TO HOW WE

01:48:26.299 --> 01:48:28.301
EXACT APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT FOR

01:48:28.368 --> 01:48:30.370
THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN HATE

01:48:30.437 --> 01:48:31.071
CRIMES.

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:33.139
BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT

01:48:33.206 --> 01:48:36.076

THAT AN OFFICER OF THE LAW.

01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:08.268
