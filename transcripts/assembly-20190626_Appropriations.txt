THE ANNUAL COST -- IS ABOUT. FOR THE STATE IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER USE. AND COUNTIES CONTRIBUTE 8% OR TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TO THE STATE WITH THE STATE PAYING THE REST OF THE COST.

GOOD MORNING BRIAN GOLDSTINE WITH THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. ALTHOUGH JUNE JUSTICE SYSTEMS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE SHRINKING RAPIDLY DJ CONTINUES TO OPERATE THREE LARGE FACILITIES AND A CAMP. AT GREAT COST TO THE STATE. AND STATE TAXPAYERS THEIR DIFFERING MOST OF THE BILL FOR THE SINK MOSTLY MALE SPENCER SYSTEM. THE CURRENT FEE FOR COMMITTING YOUTH TO DJJ. IS TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOUTH WHICH REPRESENTS JUST STATE SYSTEM. WHICH EXCEEDS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. IT'S NOT LESS EXPENSIVE FOR COUNTIES TO PAY THIS FEE. THEN TO PROVIDE SERVICES LOCALLY. THIS CREATES A PROBLEMATIC INCENTIVE. TO SEND YOUTH FOR STATE INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH MANY COUNTIES SEND FEW OR NO YOUTH TO DJJ INCLUDING MOST SMALL TOWNS. SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS ARE HEAVILY RELIANT ON THE STATE SYSTEM AND ARE FAILING TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. BY INCREASING THE FEE TO APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE TRUE COST. SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT DISINCENTIVE. FOR COUNTIES TO SEND YOUTH TO THESE FAR FROM HOME INSTITUTIONS. AND PROMOTES LOCAL REHABILITATION. WHICH RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND HISTORY SHOWS US IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. FOR THE STATE SB TWENTY FOUR WILL RESULT IN A REVENUE INCREASE. AND COST SAVINGS IN THE LOW TENS OF MILLIONS. WITH EVEN GREATER SAVINGS MADE AVAILABLE IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THE PRECISE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE BILL WILL DEPEND ON HOW COUNTIES RESPOND TO THIS DISINCENTIVE. AND WHETHER THEY CHOOSE TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF EXISTING STATE FUNDING. TO SERVE YOU'VE CLOSER TO HOME. COUNTIES YOU HAVING SEX MANY SMALL TOWNS. WILL RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FROM THE STATE. AND IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR IDOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION ON BUT AFTER QUIRK IN A SECOND BY MISS CARILLO IS SECOND WITNESS IN KEEP THAT TWO MINUTES PLEASE.

I AM ALSO HEAR SOMEONE WHO BENEFITED BY BEING KEPT IN COUNTY BECAUSE CITY ONE RESIDENT INCARCERATED AS A YOUNG PERSON.

THE ABILITY TO REMAIN CLOSE TO FAMILY AND COMMUNITY TO HAVE FAMILY VISITS AND TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CARED ABOUT US WE'RE WITNESSING OUR TREATMENT. AND ADVOCATING FOR OUR SAFETY AND CARE. AS A GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS ANNOUNCED A MOVE OF THE JUVENILE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AWAY FROM CORRECTIONS IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE CULTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE TREATMENT OF YOUTH WILL CHANGE. THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. BUT ONE THAT REQUIRES A CLEAR VISION AND COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE PROGRESS FOR YOUTH THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. AS A PART OF THIS EFFORT SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY FOUR IS ESSENTIAL. I INCREASING THE COST THE COUNTY TO PAY WHEN THEY SEND A USED TO DJJ WHO BASED ON THEIR CHARGES WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE THERE. SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY FOUR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE STATE COSTS AND TRANSFORM YOUTH LIVES. IN ADDITION LOCAL SERVICES CAN BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND JUST A FRACTION OF THE COST. AND THERE IS MONEY AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THE SERVICES. EACH YEARS COUNTIES RECEIVED THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT AND THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDER BLOCK GRANT.
