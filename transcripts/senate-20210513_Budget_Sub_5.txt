OUR IS REALLY SHIFTING FROM SELF HELP COUNTIES TO CALTRANS SO WHEN WE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT ON WORK PERFORMED ON THE SYSTEM. WE ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED BY LAW TO DO FULL COST RECOVERY TO RECOVER THAT YOU COMPLETE COST OF ABOUT OVERSIGHT WHICH INCLUDES- BOTH THE DIRECT OVERHEAD THE SUPERVISORS OF THE FOLKS DOING THE WORK AND ALSO THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD- SO. THIS BILL CAPPING THAT ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD IT 10% HAS REALLY SHIFTED THE COST FROM SELF HELP COUNTIES TO CALTRANS NOT BETWEEN SELF HELP THE NONSTOP COPS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MA'AM CHECK THANK YOU SEND A COURTESY. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE HAVE A QUESTION THAT'S A LITTLE TANGENTIAL IN A MAYBE. A CALTRANS CAN RESPOND BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ALONG WITH THE L. L. A. FOCUSED ON HERE AND THAT IS DISEASE THE OVERHEAD PROVISIONS THAT- WHO WERE PART OF THESE CUTS I ASSUME THIS IS PRIMARILY- CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING FOCUSED ON HERE. BUT IT TO THE DIZZY OVERHEAD RECAPTURE BY CALTRANS- COST RECOVERY IN OTHER WORDS APPLY TO MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THE THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN THE SAME SELF HELP COUNTIES OR OR THE EXEMPTED THERE AS WELL. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THIS EXEMPTION. IS ONLY FOR THE OVERSIGHT THAT WE PERFORM ON CAPITAL PROJECTS- ON OUR SYSTEM. YES THERE IS MAINTENANCE PAID FOR BY OTHERS ON THE SYSTEM WHICH IS FAIRLY RARE EXCEPT IN VERY. IT'S A BIG CIRCUMSTANCES- WE DO EL DO FULL COST RECOVERY ON THOSE AS WELL AT THE FULL RATE.

OKAY I'M SORRY SO AT THE END OF ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WE DO PUBLIC COMMENT FOR EVERYTHING. THANK. SO THE DEPARTMENT READY FOR PRESENTATION YES WE ARE. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. TRIMMING THE ROSTER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY FOR THE RECORD FINALLY JUST SCIENCE DIRECTOR OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS MANY CHALLENGES AND I'M HERE TO EXPLAIN HOW WE'RE HANDLING THEM. BEFORE I DO THAT THOUGH I WANT TO REMIND US OF THE CONTEXT OF OUR SITUATION. WE TEND TO COMPARE E. G. D. VAN **** ISSUES TO THE GREAT RECESSION. BUT IN MY PERFORMANCE AT THE DEPARTMENT I SEE THAT THAT'S NOT A GOOD COMPARISON. THE GREAT RECESSION CAME UPON THIS RELATIVELY GRADUALLY. THE PANDEMIC STRUCK SUDDENLY. WE WENT FROM THREE POINT 9% UNEMPLOYMENT 217% UNEMPLOYMENT ALMOST OVERNIGHT. AT THE HEIGHT OF THE GREAT RECESSION IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TEN WE PAY THREE. EIGHT THREE MILLION CLAIMS A YEAR. IN THE FIRST EIGHT WEEKS OF THE PANDEMIC. WE PAID THREE MILLION CLAIMS IN EIGHT WEEKS. AT. SINCE THE END OF DECEMBER WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED TO MASSIVE FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGES WITH CHANGES IN BENEFITS REQUIREMENTS AND EXTENSIONS. EVEN NOW AS THE PANDEMIC RECEDES EDT THIS PAIN ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN CLAIMS EVERY WEEK THIS IS A TREMENDOUS WORKLOAD. RIGHT NOW OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS GETTING CLAIMS PAID. IN THE CALL CENTER IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. AND COMING FROM AFTER THE PANEL WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTIONS. SINCE PRESIDENT. SIGNED THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ON MARCH ELEVENTH WE HAVE ENSURED THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO GET PAID FEDERAL BENEFITS. EVERY CALIFORNIA COLLECTING AN EXISTING FEDERAL PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE CLAIM WAS ABLE TO CERTIFY AND RECEIVE BENEFITS SINCE MARCH. FASTER THAN OUR INITIAL APRIL TENTH TARGET. THOSE ARE REGULAR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT OR FED IT RECEIVED THE EXTRA THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FEDERAL PAYMENT WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. B. IN UC CLAIMS HAVE ALSO BEEN MOVED TO THEIR NEW EXTENSIONS. CALIFORNIA IS PROCESSING NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMS A WEEK MORE THE SIX MORE THAN THE SECOND AND THIRD LARGEST STATES FLORIDA AND TEXAS UNBIND. DESPITE THE MASSIVE WORKLOAD INCREASE IN TWENTY TWENTY WE MADE PROGRESS IN SEVERAL AREAS. BY THE END OF JANUARY WE LIQUIDATED THE ONE POINT EIGHT ONE POINT SIX MILLION CLAIMS BACKLOG IDENTIFIED BY THE STRIKE TEAM IN SEPTEMBER. WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED TEXT MESSAGING NOTIFICATIONS AND DOCUMENT UPLOAD TO ALLOW FOR BETTER COMMUNICATION AND IMPROVE SERVICE OFFERINGS TO CLAIMS. WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STRIKE TEAM AND THE STATE AUDITOR. WE LAUNCHED A NEW DATA DASHBOARD ON OUR WEBSITE SO THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING CAN BE TRANSPARENT. WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF REDESIGNING OUR I. T. SYSTEM USING THE BEST INFORMATION FROM THE BENEFIT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT. THE LESSONS THAT WE AND THE OTHER STATES LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND NEW SOFTWARE THAT MAY HAVE BECOME AVAILABLE SINCE WE STARTED THE B. S. M. PROJECT. THE BACKLOG OF CLAIMS PENDING DEPARTMENT ACTION. LONGER THAN THREE WEEKS IS CURRENTLY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT. WELL THIS HAS FALLEN OVER 3435% SINCE FEBRUARY IT'S CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH AND I'M SURE THAT YOUR STAFF HAS LET YOU KNOW THAT. EACH OF THESE FEDERAL EXTENSIONS NECESSITATES A NEW EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO HELP CLAIMANTS AND CLEAN PROCESSORS TO UNDERSTAND THE NEW REQUIREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE YOU MUST FILE A CLAIM WHEN YOU'RE BENEFIT YEAR CANS THIS IS RESULTED IN A SURGE. BUT IF YOU HAVE. ENDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILE A NEW CLAIM. COMMUTING COMMUNICATING THAT DIFFERENCE TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IS A CHALLENGE. IT REQUIRES DEVELOPING NEW MATERIALS TO HELP PEOPLE DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF CLAIM THERE ARE NONE AND WHAT IF ANYTHING THEY MUST DO NEXT. WE KNOW THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE COMPLICATED AND WE KNOW HOW FRUSTRATING THAT HISTORICALLY. SO WE CONDUCT PUBLIC OUTREACH AS A RESULT OF THAT OUTREACH THERE WERE FIVE MILLION VISITS TO OUR WEB PAGE TO CLARIFY THE END OF THE BENEFIT YOUR PROCESS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED MORE VIDEOS TO HELP. OUR ASK ANY YOUTUBE VIDEO ON THE BENEFIT YEAR AND HAS HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND REVIEWS IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS SINCE IT WAS POSTED. WE ALSO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL OUTREACH VIA MESSAGES AND EMAILS TO CLAIMANTS WHOSE BENEFIT YEAR EXPIRED BUT THEY HAVEN'T RE APPLY. WE'RE CONDUCTING OUTREACH PROVIDE GUIDANCE THAT HELPS CLAIMS ACCURATELY COULD ANSWER THEIR CONTINUED CLAIM FORMS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WE ARE AWARE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICES HAVE EXPERIENCED A SURGE OF CLAIMS. AND WE HAVE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL ADDED ADDITIONAL YOU ARE STAFF TO WORK ON THE LEGISLATIVE REFERRALS WE HAVE REDIRECTED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE ALREADY TRAINED STAFF FROM OTHER BRANCHES OF THE DEPARTMENT. TO BACK FILL BEHIND THEM AND ASSIST WITH CLAIMS. THIS MEANS THAT MORE STAFF IS WORKING ON THE CLAIMS THAT YOUR STAFF. IS HAS REFERRED YOUR LIAISON. WE'RE MONITORING THIS WORKLOAD AND WE'RE GOING TO ADJUST STAFF TO ENSURE YOUR OFFICES WE SEEM RESOLUTION ON THESE CASES. THESE STATISTICS AND SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS ARE SIGNIFICANT. BUT THEY DON'T OFFER MUCH COMFORT TO CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WAITING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO GET THE BENEFITS. DDD WE KNOW THAT EVERY CLIMATE MATTERS. WE CONTINUE TO PUT INTENSIVE FOCUS DOING WHAT IT TAKES TO GET ELIGIBLE CLAIMANTS PAID. AND WE'RE DOING THIS AS WE FACE THE COMPLICATIONS POSED BY IMPLEMENTING THESE WELCOME NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS. A KEY AREA OF MY FOCUS HAS BEEN THE EDG CALL CENTER OPERATIONS. THE CHALLENGE WITH THE CALL CENTER IS RELATED TO THE SPEED OF PAYMENT. IT'S OBVIOUS BUT WORTH MAKING EXPLICIT. THE FASTER WE PAY BENEFITS THE FEWER CALLS CLAIMANTS NEED TO MAKE. MOST CALLERS ARE ASKING ABOUT AN EXISTING CLAIM. AS CLAIMS TO GET RESOLVED THE CALL STUFF THAT'S WHY IN JANUARY WE STARTED TO BRING ON HUNDREDS OF MORE PERMANENT STATE STAFF WHO COULD PROCESS CLAIMS TO GET. ELIGIBLE PEOPLE PAID. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CODE STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY COUNTRY ARE UNANIMOUS IN SAYING. THAT IT TAKES ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS TO TRAIN NEW CLAIM AGENTS. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THAT TO ABOUT FOUR MONTHS. THAT'S AS EFFICIENT AS WE CAN MAKE IT WHILE ENSURING HIGH QUALITY SKILLS. STILL HELP REPUBLICAN OPERATIONS IS HELPING TO REDUCE SOME OF THE CALL CENTER PRESSURE. WE MONITOR A VARIETY OF SOURCES ARE COMMON QUESTIONS IN AREAS OF PUBLIC CONFUSION. AND WE ADDRESS THEM WITH BETTER PUBLIC INFORMATION. OVER THE LAST FIVE WEEKS THE CALL CENTER. HAS RECEIVED NEARLY TWENTY MILLION CALL IT CAPS WHICH IS OVER A LAST YEAR. STILL THE AVERAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CALLS CALL ATTEMPTS PER DAY IS MORE THAN THE CALL CENTER CAN HANDLE EVEN WHEN IT IS RUNNING TWELVE HOURS A DAY. SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. DOES THAT MEAN I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THOSE TWENTY MILLION CALLS WERE MADE BY ONE POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OUR CALL CENTER. AND AT ANSWER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION OF THOSE CALLS OR THE NEWSPAPER LASSEN EXAMPLE TWENTY MINUTES TWENTY MILLION CALLS AND DATA ONLY 7% WERE ANSWERED BUT- THIS IS DIFFERENT. THESE ARE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING. WE'VE ADDED MORE ONLINE SELF SERVICE OPTIONS TO HELP PEOPLE AVOID HAVING TO CALL AT ALL. WE ALSO IDENTIFY TOP PLACEMENT QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE RESPONSIVE INFORMATION WEEKLY ON OUR WEBSITE OUR GENERAL MEDIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND EXPANDED STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH. EARLIER THIS YEAR I INVOICE THIS COMMITTEE. THAT MANY OF THE FEATURES OF THE CALL CENTER WERE DISABLED WHEN WE ARE SENT PEOPLE HOME IN AN EFFORT TO OF COURSE COMBAT THAT. OKAY TWO WEEKS AGO SO WE'RE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE'RE WE IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THOSE FEATURES TWO WEEKS AGO WE LAUNCHED A VIRTUAL HOLD FEATURE ON A LIMITED BASIS THAT ALLOWS CALLERS TO HOLD THEIR PLACE IN LINE AND HAVE THE DEPARTMENT CALL THEM BACK. WE ARE PILOTING OUR SPANISH LANGUAGE LINE NOW AND- OUR INTENTION IS TO RELIEVE CLAIMANTS OF HAVING TO CALL MULTIPLE TIMES ARE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY HAVING TO WAIT ON THE PHONE. ONE OF OUR TOP GOALS IS TO CREATE A MULTI LINGUAL TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETER SERVICES HELP LIMITED PROFICIENT CLAIMANTS. BETTER ACCESS OUR BENEFIT PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW. WE ARE INVESTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER SERVICES FOR OUR CALL CENTER TO PRESERVE CLAIMANTS IN POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF LANGUAGES WE NOW HAVE DEDICATED PHONE LINES IN ENGLISH SPANISH CANTONESE MANDARIN AND VIETNAMESE. THIS WILL BE OUR FOR OUR FUTURE EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE A MULTI LINGUAL ACCESS PORTAL AND OTHER NEW ELLIE P. SERVICES. WE HAVE TO REACH OUT TO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WITH INVESTMENT PUBLIC OUTREACH AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH SPECIALIZED LOCAL AND IN LANGUAGE MEDIA. FINALLY WE RECOGNIZE THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS OR THE ABILITY TO USE THE INTERNET WHEN WE CAN TALK CONTINUE TO TALK TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO FIND BETTER WAYS TO SERVE THOSE PEOPLE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW. LAST YEAR WE TOOK STEPS TO ENHANCE OUR FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION. AND TO ADDRESS THE UNPRECEDENTED IMPOSTOR FRAUD SEEN HERE GONNA TRY TO IVORY NOW. THE CRIMINAL SCHEMES MOVED TO OTHER STATES WITH WEAKER FRIED FILTERS ALTHOUGH WE ARE STILL INTERCEPTING FRAUDULENT ATTEMPTS REGULARLY. WE LUNCHED IDENTIFICATION IDENTITY VERIFICATION AND ROBUST FRONT FILTERS TO CHECK CLAIMING INFORMATION AGAINST A DATABASE OF THOMSON REUTERS TO PROTECT FROM THIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. NEW EFFORTS TO CURB FRAUD SUCH A STRONGER IDENTITY VERIFICATION WITH ID ME HAVE ADDED ANOTHER LAYER OF REVIEW. THIS NEW MEASURE HAS STOPPED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL FRAUD. HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT YET STRUCK THE BALANCE WE NEED BETWEEN SECURITY AND SPEED. SO WE ARE NOW WE FIND IN OUR FRAUD FILTERS SO THAT LEGITIMATE CLAIMS ARE NOT CAUGHT UP OR DELAYED BECAUSE OF OUR FRAUD PREVENTION EFFORTS. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NATIONALLY UP 235% OFCLAIMS LAST YEAR WERE FRAUDULENT. WE INTEND TO HOLD THOSE HI ANGELA CLEMENTS ACCOUNTABLE OUR INVESTIGATIONS UNIT CONTINUES TO PROVIDE VALUABLE LEADS AND EVIDENCE TO LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS WE ARE SEEING A RISING TIDE OF SEARCH WARRANTS ARRESTS PROSECUTIONS AND CONVICTIONS. THE WEEK BEFORE LAST THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ANNOUNCED THAT THE STATE TASK FORCE ON PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE FUNDS HAS LED TO THE ARREST OF SIXTY EIGHT SUSPECTS. OPENED ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND THIS WILL CONTINUE TO RAMP UP. WE HAVE BUILT STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SHARE DATA WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO HELP CATCH MULTISTATE FRAUDSTERS. WE ARE COST CROSS REFERENCE THE DATA GETS LAW ENFORCEMENT RECORDS SUSPENDED MULTIPLE CLAIMS FROM SINGLE ADDRESSES FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE STATE AUDITOR RECOMMENDATIONS TO HAVE A FRONT ORGANIZATION THAT COORDINATES ALL FRAUD PREVENTION. AND DETECTION EFFORTS ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE COMMITTED TO HELPING VICTIMS OF IDENTITY FRAUD WE KNOW CRIMINALS USE STOLEN REAL IDENTITIES BACK FROM THE DARK WEB TO FILE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. IN RESPONSE WE ARE CONTINUALLY REACHING OUT TO THE PUBLIC ON HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT. WE ALSO HELP PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE TEN NINETY NINE G. SHOWING FORMS SHOWING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THEY DID NOT SEEK. HOWEVER AS I SAID OUR FRAUD FILLED FILTERS HAVE ONE WOULD BE ONLY SWEPT UP LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS SO THAT'S THE REASON THAT WERE RISKS OF REASSESSING OUR FILTERS. IN CLOSING THE FOCUS OF THE PENDANT SINCE THE FOCUS SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN EDT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR CLAIMS. DURING THE WORST YEAR OF THE RECESSION AS I SAID THERE WERE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THERE HAVE BEEN TWENTY TWO MILLION CLAIMS IN THIS PANDEMIC. THE WORK THE VALUE OF WORK IS STAGGERING. DURING THAT SAME TIME THE ENTIRE EDG WORKFORCE WAS MOVING TO REMOTE TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS. MASS HIRING WE DIRECTED WORKERS FROM OTHER FROM FROM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS. CONTINUED STAFFING UP AND THE USE OF BENDERS HAVE ALL PLAYED A PART OF THE EFFORT TO RESPOND TO THE HISTORIC DEMANDS FOR BENEFITS DURING AN UNPRECEDENTED YEAH SURE LANGUAGES. DESPITE THOSE DISRUPTIONS WE HAVE MANAGED TO PAY OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS. WE HAVE HANDLED MAJOR PROBLEMS. THE ELIMINATION OF THE ONE POINT SIX BACKLOG OF CLAIMS. OPENING THE CALL CENTER TO RUN TWELVE DAYS TWELVE HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK HIRING HUNDREDS OF NEW STATE WORKERS AND LAUNCHING NO. IDENTITY VERIFICATION TO PREVENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FIVE. NOW THERE ARE NEW CHALLENGES PROCESS THE NEW CLAIMS AS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE REACH THE END OF THE YEAR RECEIVING BENEFITS. INTEGRATION OF NEW VERIFICATION PROCEDURES REDUCING THE BACKLOG OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT CLAIMS AND WORKING WITH PROSECUTORS TO HOLD SOPHISTICATED FRAUDSTERS FROM LAST YEAR ACCOUNTABLE. WE HAVE A SOLID ROAD MAP FROM THE STRIKE TEAM AND THE AUDITOR AND WE'RE PUTTING THOSE CHANGES IN PLACE. I WANT TO THANK LEGISLATORS WHO IN SO MANY WAYS HAVE CONSISTENTLY OFFERED ME. AND THE DEPARTMENT HELP AND ADVICE AND TO THEIR STAFF. WHO HAVE SERVED OUR CLIENTS WHO ARE THEIR CONSTITUENTS. FINALLY MANY THANKS TO OUR MAGNIFICENT STAFF WHO HAVE STEPPED UP FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE G. D. TO RESPOND TO THIS EMERGENCY. I AM HOPING THAT THIS HEARING RESULTS IN A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE IN A WELCOME ANY NEW IDEAS OFFERED BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR SIGNS OF WE WANT TO MOVE ON TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BOB HARRIS AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ANNOUNCED THE PROJECT MANAGER ON OUR TWO MOST RECENT AUDITS IF EDG- TODAY I'LL PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN OVERVIEW OF EDIE'S PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE COMING OUT OF THOSE TWO REFUSE. TO STARTED LIKE TO DIRECT THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION TO A DOCUMENT WE PROVIDED- THIS DOCUMENT IS A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF ETP'S PROGRESS THUS FAR WE'VE ASSESSED ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE NEED TO DO AND WHERE HE'S AT AND THAT'S PROGRESS- IN THAT DOCUMENT GIVES YOU A STATUS FOR EACH RECOMMENDATION EVEN SOME I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT MY TESTIMONY TODAY. IT ALSO GIVES YOU ON THE LAST PAGE AN OVERVIEW OF THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE AND THEN FINALLY PROVIDES IN GREEN HIGHLIGHTING AN INDICATION WHENEVER A STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM- FROM SEPTEMBER OVERLAPS OR IS COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR RECOMMENDATION WE MADE DVD SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR. THE COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE DVDS PROGRESS AND THROUGH A FEW DIFFERENT LENSES THE FIRST IS WHERE EDS MADE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE PROGRESS. YOU'LL PROBABLY KNOW THAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE TIMELINES WHERE WE EXPECTED EDT SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED CERTAIN ACTIVITIES- AND WITH RESPECT TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE WHERE OUR EXPECTATION WAS THAT YOU DID YOU WOULD HAVE ALREADY ACHIEVED FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THIS POINT IN TIME IN THE CALENDAR. THEY HAVE DONE SO THEY'VE AT LEAST FULLY OR OR PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED THE MAJORITY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE EXPECTED THEY WOULD ACHIEVE BY NOW SO THAT'S GOOD PROGRESS THAT THEY'VE MADE. AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED A FREE RICK REFRESH THEIR WEBPAGE TO PROVIDE A MORE CLEAR PICTURE OF THE BACKLOG OF CLAIMS. THAT REQUIRE YOU TO D. ACTION. THEY ALSO AT FEATURES TO THEIR CALL CENTER THIS NEED TO SURE THAT BACKS IS A- AND LET. OTHER THAN ENGLISH IS STILL A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO PROVIDE A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. I WANT TO TAKE PARTICULAR TIME TO KNOW EDIE'S PROGRESS AND HELPING VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT WE SAW DURING THE PANDEMIC PERIOD. THE PEOPLE'S IDENTITIES WERE STOLEN AND THE FRAUDSTERS USE THOSE IDENTITIES TO FILE FALSE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS. UNFORTUNATELY THAT LEAVES THE VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT WITH THE TAX LIABILITY. EDT CAN HELP THOSE VICTIMS- CLEAR THAT TAX LIABILITY BUT THEY NEED AN AVAILABLE RESOURCE AT U. D. D. TO CONTACT DVD ENTERTAINMENT ASSISTANCE THAT'S WHY WE RECOMMENDED ET DE SET UP A DEDICATED LINE. TO COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND INEFFICIENT PROCESS WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF STAFFING TO PROCESS THAT WORKLOAD. WE CAN SAY THAT FOR RIGHT NOW EASIEST ON ALL OF THOSE THINGS NOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT WORKLOAD OVER TIME AS IT MIGHT FLUCTUATE IN THE COMING MONTHS BUT WE ARE. SAYING THAT FOR NOW THEY FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT VERY IMPORTANT AREA. SO THAT'S GOOD PROGRESS THAT HE'S MAKING. ACCORDING TO THE TIMELINE THAT WE EXPECTED IT TO. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE ALSO A COUPLE KEY AREAS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHERE EDT IS NOT ON TRACK WITH WHERE WE EXPECTED THEM TO BE BY NOW IN THOSE TWO AREAS THAT I'LL HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE OR IN THE AREA OF WORKFORCE AND WORKLOAD PLANNING. AND THEN- THE CREATION OF A FRAUD- UNIT. FIRST ON WORKFORCE AND WORKLOAD PLANNING SO DURING OUR AUDIT WE FOUND SOME CONCERNS RELATED TO HOW EASY WAS ANTICIPATING. UPCOMING WORKLOAD- WE SAW THAT IT WAS TRYING TO ANTICIPATED UPCOMING WORKLOAD. BASED ESSENTIALLY ON HISTORICAL DATA. NOT ON. A ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT ARE COMING OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS BUT THAT UNFORTUNATELY. ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE SOMETIMES THE WORKLOAD WILL INCREASE- BASED ON SEASONAL FLUCTUATION OR OTHER ECONOMIC INDICATORS SO WE WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR EDT TO DEVELOP A BETTER WORKLOAD PROJECTION MODEL. AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THEY STILL HAVEN'T MADE. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. SECONDARILY WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT AN AMPLE LARGE IMPENDING WORKLOAD THAT YOU DO IS ALSO GOING TO NEED TO MANAGE WHILE IT SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURE THAT IT CONTINUED TO PAY TIMELY BENEFITS. AND THAT IS THE DEFERRED WORK THAT UNITY WAS NOT PERFORMING DURING THE HEART AT THAT PART OF THE PANDEMIC PERIOD. BUT FOR WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW EXPECTS YOU NEEDED TO GO BACK AND COMPLETE THAT'S A VERY LARGE WORKLOAD WE WERE CONCERNED THAT WITHOUT A VERY. STRUCTURED AND RISK BASED PLAN FOR HOW YOU DO THE WOULD. ADDRESS THAT WORKLOAD IT WAS GOING TO STRUGGLE TO ADEQUATELY OR OPTIMALLY BALANCED IT'S COMPETING OBLIGATIONS. WITH RESPECT TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT WORKLOADS. THEY NEED TO HAVE A FIRM PLAN IN PLACE FOR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THEIR STAFF. AND ALL OF THESE IMPENDING WORKLOADS AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE STILL WANT TO SEE MORE PROGRESS FROM EDT. I MENTIONED ALSO THE COMPLETION OF A FRAUD UNIT IS AN AREA WHERE WE DON'T FEEL LIKE EATING HE'S MADE ADEQUATE PROGRESS AND RESPECTFULLY. WE DO NOT AGREE THAT EDIE HAS IMPLEMENTED THE RECOMMENDATION TO CREATE A DEDICATED UNIT FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING ITS FRAUD PREVENTION APPROACH. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT BEST PRACTICES WITH THE JUST EIGHTY SHOULD DO WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR AUDIT WAS A FRAGMENTED APPROACH WHERE VARIOUS UNITS. NEEDED TO COORDINATE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SOMETIMES DIDN'T DO SO EFFECTIVELY. WE CAN SEE THAT EDT HAS TAKEN. SOME STEPS TOWARDS CREATING THAT KIND OF YOU KNOW. THEY. COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE THERE ARE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE FOR WHICH THE TIME LINES THE EXPECTED DEADLINES HAVE NOT YET COME TO PASS BUT ARE STILL VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED BETTER CALL CENTER MANAGEMENT AND ALSO- INCREASED AUTOMATION OF CLAIM PROCESSING WHERE WE'D HAVE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO EDT- AND THEY HAVE NOT INDICATED YET THAT THEY'RE DONE WITH THEM OR DO WE AGREE THERE IF THEY'RE DONE YET WITH IMPLEMENTING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS SO. STILL A LOT OF IMPORTANT WORK YET TO COME AND WITH THAT I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MASS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. MORNING ON THIS IS MARK AND THEN AS WITH THE FROM THE FINANCE NO COMMENTS BUT I AM AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU- AND NOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT CENTER GROW AND THEN SENATOR NEWMAN. RIGHT OKAY I WILL BE FAST SO I JUST DIRECT SIGNS- I JUST WANTED TO COMMEND YOU INTO THANK YOU- AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FERRIES FOR MAKING YOURSELF SO AVAILABLE NOT JUST TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT TO THE VARIOUS OTHER COMMITTEES AND GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN MEETING OF THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING MY WORKING GROUP EVERY TWO WEEKS- ANSWERED NO QUESTION THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE I DON'T THINK YOU'VE RISEN TO THE MOMENT FOR YOU COMING IN LATE- IN A WAY THAT'S IMPRESSIVE- AND I AM HOPEFUL- THAT THE WORK WILL CONTINUE TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT. AT RISK RESUME BE ECONOMIC AND THAT WE WILL NOT ZERO SO THIS POSITION GOING TO THE JOYSTICK COMMENT YOU THANK YOU SENATE I'M THINKING MADAM CHAIR DIRECTOR SCENTED STEP A PLACE TO C. AGAIN- I REMEMBER COME FROM. HEARING JUST AND- I'LL SAY THE SAME THING TODAY IS I DID BACK THEN- YOU HAVE WALKED INTO A HORNET'S NEST I AM VERY- PLEASE THAT YOUR PROBLEM SOLVING SOLUTIONS ARE BEING APPLIED TO THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE EDDIE EDT NOW- ALL THAT SAID I KNOW THAT EDIE'S TAKEN STEPS TO IMPROVE. AND I AND- WITH THE AUDIT REPORT OF THE CURRENT- THAT. CHANGES THAT ARE BEING MADE I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT UPDATE AND- AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WORKING- REALLY HARD- FROM ALL AREAS OF THE STATE THAT- LANDED A POSITION AT EDT. TO HELP US GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS- BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THINGS- I DON'T WANNA SAY ARE GETTING FAT DONE FAST ENOUGH BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR BEST BET IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME BASED ON WHAT CALMATTERS IS REPORTING IN THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO. IS THAT THE BACKLOG IS ACTUALLY GROWING LARGER. AND THAT THERE ARE MORE PENDING CLAIMS- NOW THAT OUR AND RESOLVED THEN THERE WERE A AS OF MAY EIGHTH I GUESS AS A MATE THEY WERE 1-009-500-0500 EIGHTY FIVE BACKLOG OF CLAIMS. WHICH IS THE TWENTY ONE DAYS EDT ACTION- AND THE NUMBER BEFORE THAT WAS NINE HUNDRED AND NINE. THOUSAND CLAIMANTS CERTIFICATIONS- IN CLAIMS S. I KNOW YOU'VE GIVEN A SAID A LONG LINK FLEA EXPLANATION OF. HOW WE'RE CLEARING UP THE BACKLOG. AND I AGAIN I RECOGNIZE THE MAN THAT DIRECTOR THAT YOU WALKED INTO WHAT I WOULD CALL A HORNET'S NEST AND- I APPLAUD YOU FOR TAKING ON THIS HUMONGOUS CHALLENGE TO FIX. A BIT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING IS ACTUALLY INCREASING THE BACKLOG CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT FOR ME. PLEASE. WELL LET ME OUR FIRST SAY THAT- ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'VE PUT IN A NEW DASHBOARD IS THAT PEOPLE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE PREVIOUS DASH DASH BOARD. NUMBER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND. IS NOT HAVE TO DO. WITH THE WORK THAT EDG. IS DOING. WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH AN IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE TO COME INTO THE DEPARTMENT AND RECERTIFY. YOUR ELIGIBILITY. SO ARE I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP BECAUSE HE GIVES ME A CHANCE TO CLARIFY THAT. WE'RE NOT SURPRISED THAT WE HAVE MORE WORK RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE INSTITUTED THESE TWO MAJOR NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS. YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS EASY FOR OUR CLIENTS TO UNDERSTAND. SO OFTEN THEY MAKE MISTAKES IN THEIR APPLICATIONS AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS. IS WORKING WITH THOSE PEOPLE NOW NOW SO WHAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BASICALLY IS A SURGE IN APPLICATIONS AND- IT'S TAKING US SOME TIME TO KEEP UP WITH HIM. BUT I WILL LET ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES- OFFER SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT AND I WANT TO SAY- ASSEMBLY WOMAN. THAT I REALLY DO OF. YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WERE IN. WE ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING YET YEARS ARE ALL IMPROVEMENTS THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER. BUT AS I SAID THAT THE WORKLOAD IS STAGGERING AND- WE'RE LOOKING FOR EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITY PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS DALY BOTH THAT RANK AND FILE STAFF THE MANAGERS OF THE EXECUTIVES- SO FAR THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THAT REGARD AND- I'LL HAVE MY COLLEAGUES ANSWER ANY. DETAILED QUESTIONS ON THERE. THANK YOU DIRECTOR CONSIST CAROL WILLIAMS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AND I'LL BE BRIEF BUT WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE CLEAR WITH YOU AND TO BE CLEAR WITH THE MEDIA OUTLETS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE BACKLOG IS INCREASING AND I'LL TOUCH ON THAT THE CURRENT BACKLOG FOR EDIE DAY'S WORK OVER IT THAT IS PENDING OVER TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THIS IS ON THE NEW DASHBOARD DELIVERED BY WAY OF THE CSA RECOMMENDATION AS WELL AS DISTRACTING. IS A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS YOU'RE CORRECT THE PRIOR WEEK. THE BACKLOG WAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PRIOR TO THAT THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS. FULL TRANSPARENCY. THE READ. THE REASON- THE INCREASE IS OCCURRING IS AS THE DIRECTOR HAS JUST- ADDRESSED ONE THERE IS- A LOT OF WORK GOING ON WITH THE BENEFIT YEAR ENDING BUT WHAT THIS BACKLOG IS. OVER 95% OF THE BACKLOG FOR EDIE'S WORK HAS TO DO WITH DETERMINATIONS. AS MOST OF YOUR WERE ALL OF YOUR WHERE BEGINNING IN JANUARY EDT RESOUND DETERMINATIONS AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CLAIMS TO ENSURE THAT THE CLAIMANT IS ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE. BEGAN THAT WORK AND BECAUSE OF HOW THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING OUT BECAUSE OF HOW THE ANSWERS OR THE CLAIMANTS ARE RESPONDING THIS WORK IS COMPOUNDING THAT THE ET DE STAFF MUST HANDLE. INDIVIDUALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT FULL AUTOMATION FOR ANYTHING THAT WE CAN AUTOMATE REGARDING THE CLAIMANT'S- THAT THE WAY THAT THEY'VE RESPONDED IN THEIR ANSWERS. AB BUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME THAT WE MUST ACTUALLY OBTAINED INFORMATION FROM THE CLIENT AND SO THAT IS WHERE THE BACKLOG IS INCREASING BUT IS. COUPLED WITH US BEING MORE CLEAR ON HOW THE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED AND WHAT THE RESPONSES WILL- WHAT WILL OCCUR DEPENDING ON HOW THEY RESPOND TO THE ANSWERS. ON OUR WEBSITE IN ACTUALLY ON THEIR CERTIFICATION FORMS SO IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- RESPONSE AND AGAIN DIRECTOR SIGNS I APPLAUD YOU FOR TAKING ON THIS ROLE I WANT TO MOVE TO SOME QUESTIONS ON THE FRAUD PREVENTION AND I APPRECIATE YOU- DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CORRECT INFORMATION IS- AVAILABLE WHEN APPLICANTS TO APPLY FOR THESE BENEFITS- I WANT TO MOVE TO THE FRAUD PART OF IT I DO REALIZE THAT THERE IS A DELICATE BALANCE TO. A STOP AND INTENDED INDIVIDUALS FROM GETTING BENEFITS- LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE COUPLE ANDERSON CARTY WHO WERE- VESTED BY POLICE OFFICERS THEY FOUND OUT THAT THEY READ AND- WELL LET'S SEE HOW THAT THE THEY WERE DOING DRUG TRAFFICKING HUMAN TRAFFICKING CREDIT CARD FRAUD EDT FRAUD AND THEY ESTIMATED THAT. THEY ACTUALLY APPLIED FOR FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN EDP D. BENEFITS AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN WITHDRAWING TWO POINT THREE EIGHT TWO. MILLION DOLLARS IN EDT BENEFITS. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY. BUT IS ONE OF THE FRAUD MECHANISMS THAT YOU HAVE IS- LOOKING AT CLAIMS MORE SOPHISTICATED LEE IF FOR- A CAP I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR CAP. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE AVERAGE INCOME AND INDIVIDUALS IN COMMUNITIES THAT. LIKE RESTAURANTS- A BARTENDER SERVERS FOR THE HOTEL INDUSTRY THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. IT WOULD SET OFF AN ALARM IF ANYBODY WAS WITHDRAWING- APPLYING FOR FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS. IS THERE A CALF A REASONABLE CAP TO INVESTIGATE ON FRAUD- I MEAN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT REASONABLE CAP IS I'M ASSUMING SOMEBODY MAKES FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR YOU KNOW FIFTY TWO WEEKS FOR THE BENEFIT TO TOTAL THAT OUT. BUT IF THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUALS DURING YOU KNOW ONE ONE MILLION DOLLAR CLAIMS PER SE IS THERE A CAP- ON ANY TYPE OF THE BENEFITS IS THAT MAKES SENSE NOT A CAP TO STOP THE BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO IT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE ENTITLED TO IT BUT- I MEAN IF SOMEBODY APPLIES REPORT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD SET OFF JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AN ALARM. BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO WITHDRAW TWO POINT EIGHT THREE TWO MILLION GOOD GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK. IT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS RATHER THAN ONE. PERSON APPLYING FOR FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN. BENEFITS WHICH WOULD OBVIOUSLY SET OFF ALARMS IMMEDIATELY. ALL HAVE STOLEN IDENTITIES FROM THE WEB. HAVE CREATED BACKSTORIES TO THEM AND HAVE APPLIED MULTIPLE TIMES. THAT'S WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING THAT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING NOW NO ONE GETS THROUGH WITHOUT GOING TO OUR FRAGILE TRUCE SO THAT IS NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN AGAIN. AND WE ARE CONTROL WE ARE MONITORING. ANY ADDRESS IN WHICH MORE THAN SEVEN PEOPLE ARE APPLYING AND I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE ISSUES WITH SOMETIMES HOMELESS PEOPLE USING THE SHELTERS ADDRESS SO WE INVESTIGATE ALL OF THOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ANOTHER CHANCE TO CLARIFY NO THANK YOU MA'AM FOR CLARIFYING THAT SITS I WAS READING THAT AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT'S THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME FRAUD PREVENTION MECHANISMS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. TO HELP- REDUCE THAT AND- AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR THE SEVEN PEOPLE PER HOUSEHOLD- IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC I HAD ONE CONSTITUENT BRING ME OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY AM EDT REPLIES TO THEIR ADDRESS WHICH WAS NOT THEM APPLYING FOR IT THAT AND THEY HAD APPLIED THE INDIVIDUAL EASIER ADDRESS IT APPLIED FOR BENEFITS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUTTING THOSE MECHANISM PLACE THE NEXT THING I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO IS AND THAT DEBT IN THE U. I FIND YOU HAVE A CURRENT BALANCE IN THE DEBT- AND THE WIFE AND. ALL ESTIMATED MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE DEBT IN THE U. I. FUND IS CURRENTLY AT TWENTY. BILLION DOLLARS ALL HAS HIT MY COLLEAGUES WOULD WANT TO CORRECT ME ON THAT. YOU SEE BILLION MA'AM. YES OKAY THANK YOU. YEAH THIS IS KEVIN MILEAGE FOR YOU TO DATE- THE CURRENT- LOAN BALANCES AT TWENTY POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. OKAY THANK YOU IS THERE A IS THERE A PLAN AN WITHIN THE E. D. DE PART MENT TO ADDRESS THAT OR IS THAT JUST GOING TO FALL ON THE FOOD A TAX REDUCTION CREDIT AND EMPLOYERS THAT HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING. TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN THE PANDEMIC WILL JUST HAVE TO FOOT THE BILL LIKE THEY DID- A FEW YEARS AGO OR IS THERE A PLAN. BY EDG I MEAN I KNOW YOU WERE I REALIZE THAT YOU NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO FUND A PLAN BUT IS THERE A PLAN. TO ADDRESS THAT DEBT- OTHER VAN THE FOOD FEDERAL YOU KNOW THE FUTURE TAX REDUCTION CREDIT THAT COMES FROM THE FED'S. AT THIS POINT. OF WHAT WE HAVE IS THE LAW TO FOLLOW. AND DRIVEN IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BUT- WE HAVE TO FOLLOW CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW. YEAH JUST AS YOU SET ASIDE OR GROW THE- CURRENT MECHANISM FOR REPAYING A LOAN AS THOSE FOR THE REDUCTION CREDITS- THERE IS. YOU KNOW CURRENTLY NO PROPOSAL ON TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIT- AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AND JUST REFRESH MY MEMORY M. IS IT IS IT GOING TO BE SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME WHERE THESE PAYMENTS WERE JUST DO YOU GOT A NOTICE JANUARY FIRST AND IF YOU GET PAID BY THE TENTH WHICH YOU KNOW SMALL RESTAURANT THEIR BILL MIGHT BE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF THEY DIDN'T PAY IT BY THE TENTH THERE WOULD BE A 10% PENALTY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT EVERY DAY THAT THEY DIDN'T PAY IT IS THAT SIMILAR WHAT. TO WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME. THE ORDERS WILL RECEIVE THE NEW TAX BILL AND IN JANUARY FOR- WHAT THAT WHAT IS OWED FOR THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE- THAT THOSE SAME MECHANISMS THAT WERE IN PLACE FOR THE GREAT RECESSION ARE STILL IN PLACE- AND I WILL BE HOW THE- THE LOAN IS PAID BACK. UNLESS THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THE LAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR FOR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU- DIRECTOR SIGNS AGAIN THANK YOU- IT WAS MY PLAY BRIDGE RIGHT PRIVILEGE TO. AN INTERVIEW AND TALK TO AND CONFIRM YOU TO THIS POSITION AND- I ALMOST FEEL GUILTY AFTER DOING THAT CONFIRMATION BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THAT YOU ACTUALLY FIND YOURSELF IN BUT I APPLAUD YOU FOR TAKING ON THE ROLE. AND BEING A PROBLEM SOLVER IN THIS IN THIS ARENA THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE I THINK THOSE ARE ALL REALLY SENATOR GREAT THE- QUESTIONS AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE- DIRECTOR SIGNS ARE RESPONSES. FROM. FIFTY YES SENATOR COURTESY OF THE PERFUME QUICKLY WITHIN EVERY CRITIC. I'M NOT SURE THESE ARE QUICK QUIZ I CAN'T COME TO THE ANSWERING WILL BE QUICK ON IN SO YOU GO IT. THEY WERE BOTH THE NUMBER HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGE OF. THIS MAYBE I CAN JUST LAY OUT MY QUESTIONS A DOZEN FEEL LIKE A THE DIRECT EXAM. GOING ON HERE- IN AND- PERSON DIRECTOR IN IN I THINK ONE OF THEM IS FOR THE AUDITOR- YOU KNOW WE- NEARER TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CALENDAR YEAR WE HAD THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING- WE HEARD. THE AUDIT. A LOT OF US ASK QUESTIONS AND PART OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO HERE WAS JUST ON A ON A COUPLE OF THOSE QUESTIONS YOU KNOW FOLLOW UP ON. PROGRESS BUT- MORE THINGS ARE HEARD TODAY WAS THAT THERE ARE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION. CLAIMS TOTAL IN JUST BUT I AM ASSUMING THOSE ARE UNIQUE. INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS GIVEN THAT WE ONLY HAVE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE- BACK OF THE ENVELOPE MATH ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OUR CHILDREN- THAT WOULD LEAVE THIRTY MILLION OF EACH AND EVERY ADULT PERSON IN THE STATE PUT IN A CLAIM- IN THE SITE I THANK I'M GUESSING THAT THAT. HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE REDUNDANCY OR THE FRAUD OR- SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A NOTE CENTER GROVE WAS ASKING SOME QUESTIONS AROUND THAT- BUT THAT WOULD BE ONE OF MY QUESTIONS JUST WHAT IS IT THIRTY MILLION REALLY REPRESENT- IN. IN IN IN THE OTHER QUESTION IS- JUST ASK NOW YOU CAN ANSWERING BOTH FROM HIT TO HIT YOU WITH COMPOUND QUESTIONS HERE BUT- THEY'RE NOT HARD QUESTIONS OF. BACK AT THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING. YOU TALK ABOUT HAVING. NINE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL STAFF BY NOW- BROUGHT ON TO EITHER TO HELP WITH THE WHOLE SITUATION BACKLOG PHONES EVERYTHING IS AS I UNDERSTOOD IT. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS WHAT IS REALLY THAT THE SITUATION WITH THAT I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SOME ODD. HIRES WHICH IS. GOOD BUT I DIDN'T HEAR NINE HUNDRED. AND ALSO. A SOME INFORMATION- A THAT WAS SHARED WITH WITH MY OFFICE- THAT'S WHEN THE POLICY COMMITTEE CHAIRS BY THE BY THE- OFFICE OF PROTEIN- I THOUGHT INDICATED THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CALENDAR YEAR SINCE AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING THERE'S ACTUALLY A NET REDUCTION IN- IN STAFF AND I MAY BE READING THAT WRONG BUT- DUE TO ATTRITION WHEN REFERRING TO IS A TRADITION SO HOUSE ATTRITION PLAYED INTO. WHERE YOU STAND NOW IN TERMS OF. CAPACITY PERSONNEL- HUMAN RESOURCES. THOSE ARE THE TWO QUESTIONS FOR THE DIRECTORY YOU-KNOW I TO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR- LET ME ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IN TWO WAYS. OUR FIRST WELL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILLION CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN PAID OVER THE- AGE OF THE PANDEMIC TURNER. THOSE REPRESENT MULTIPLE CLAIMS BY INDIVIDUALS SO INDEED WE DO NOT HAVE THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE APPLYING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FELL. AT THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT PEOPLE CAN APPLY CAN COVER APPEARED TO TWENTY SIX WEEKS. WITHIN A YEAR'S OUR QUALIFICATION PERIOD SO THAT'S WHAT THE TWENTY TWO MILLION REPRESENTS. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION RIGHT SO WE'RE COUNTING CLAIMS AS THIS EACH HALF HOUR THE REVIVAL OF THE CLAIM OF THREE DIFF THE RESERVE RENEWAL. RIGHT SINCE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US IN WHAT WE DO IS WE ARE. DETERMINED THAT EVERY TWO WEEKS A PERSON WE CERTIFIERS FOR THEIR CLAIM AND WE ARE REVIEW THAT TO INSURE THAT THEY ARE INDEED ARE AVAILABLE FOR WORK ARE NOT WORKING ALREADY. AND ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS SO YEAH SO IT'S NOT THREE MILLION IT'S NOT THE JOB. BACK TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE- UNDERSTAND WILL THANK YOU. I'M SORRY SIR I UNDER THAT WELL ENOUGH AT THE POINT FOR YOU OKAY ARE A GREAT HEY YOU ASKED ABOUT HIGHER. SO ARE MY WHEN I SAID THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE PEOPLE I WAS TALKING ABOUT STAFF THAT WE HAVE TAKEN FROM OTHER BRANCHES AND BROUGHT INTO OUR- TO HANDLE SOME OF THESE ARE LEGISLATIVE REFERRALS THAT YOUR STAFF. IS MANAGING. HI THIS IS WE DID THIS ARE STARTING LAST WEEK. AND THESE ARE FULLY TRAINED PEOPLE THEIR PEOPLE WHO CAME INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BRANCH. OFF FROM TAX BRANCH OR FROM A WORK SERVICES BRANCH WHO ARE ALREADY TRAINED BECAUSE THEY PARTICIPATED DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC. IN OUR IN REVIEWING CLAIMS. SO THAT'S NOT A NEW HIRE IT'S A REDIRECTION. WE CONTINUE TO HIRE PEOPLE- IN JANUARY WE BROUGHT CON I THINK SOMEWHERE IN THE YEAR TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE WHO ARE FULLY TRAINED. TO BE ON THE PHONES AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING THOSE NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND IF YOUR OFFICE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NUMBERS ON THAT WOULD BE GLAD TO PROVIDE THEM. BUT WE HAVEN'T HIRED UP ALL THOSE PEOPLE YET- THANK YOU I WOULD I WOULD JUST TELL US IF YOU COULD DISTRIBUTE THOSE NUMBERS TO ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OFFICES- AND GENERALLY. OF THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN THE SAME INFORMATION BUT I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW WE CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE I THINK IS- PROBABLY THE MAIN. TONE HERE THEME HERE- DIRECTOR IF I COULD OFFER THOSE THOSE NUMBERS RIGHT NOW THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL SURE. PLEASE WILLIAMS. SO IN THE- INFORMATIONAL HEARING WE SHARED THE AROUND THE NINE HUNDRED. GOAL TO HIRE. THE PLAN HIRES. WE HAD PLANNED TO HIRE NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN JANUARY THROUGH MAY. OF THIS YEAR. THE ACTUAL HIRES JANUARY THROUGH MAY OF THIS YEAR. R. SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT SO WE FELL SHORT ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE- FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THIS YEAR TO DATE AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING THAT IT IS. IT IS- DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT TOO DIFFICULT TO RETAIN OR ATTRITION RATE IS- OVER 30% PARTICULAR FOR THE CALL CENTER AND THAT'S NOT. UNLIKE OTHER CALL CENTERS BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT THE REST OF OUR HIRES PLANNED FOR JUNE THROUGH AUGUST WERE PLANNING FOR SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY. AND THAT'S THE- EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM REP THAT'S THE HIGHEST CLASSIFICATION THAT THE CLASSIFICATION THAT CAN NEARLY DO A 100% OF THE WORK LOAD WHERE COURAGE ABOUT. THOSE NUMBERS AND THAT IS OUR PLAN FOR- JUNE TO AUGUST THANK YOU HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT TO- ANYTHING. THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE COULD PROVIDE IN TERMS OF RETENTION- INCENTIVES- IN AND OUT OF MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD HAVE BE ACROSS THE BOARD NOT TARGETED TO ANYBODY WHO. TENDERS RESIGNATION BUT- HE YOU KNOW YOU IN THESE TERMS WITH IN THESE TIMES WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING FROM HAZARD PAY TO- YOU NAME IT AND- I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY IT PROBABLY IS JUST A FOLLOW DAY HAZARD PAY FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE ANSWERS PHONE CALLS I KNOW MYSELF FEELS THAT WAY SOMETIMES SO. ALL JOKING ASIDE AND JUST WONDERFUL I'M LOOKING FOR WAYS THAT WE CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE TO. TO HELP YOU. IN THERE'S ONLY A FEW THINGS WE CONTROL ONE OF THOSE- WOULD BE. RESOURCES DOLLARS AN- ILL- THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. I KNOW AT ANY TIME CAROLINE'S WE'RE- HAPPY TO. PARTNER WITH YOU FOR RECRUITMENT AND SOME HAVE ASKED US FOR SCHEDULES OF RECRUITMENT FOR THOSE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT WE CERTAINLY CAN EASILY PROVIDE THAT TO ANYONE ACROSS THE STATE ANY OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED. THE AGAIN I JUST I DON'T WANT TO BE RETURNED IT BUT IT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO HIRE AND TRAIN PEOPLE BUT- IT SEEMS LIKE THE MORE EFFICIENT ROUTE IS TO TRY TO RETAIN. THE 30% THAT ARE GOING AWAY- RATHER THAN LOSE THEM AND HAVE TO SPEND FOR FIVE MONTHS. IT RECRUITED IN TRAINING AGAIN SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT SOME. SOME THOUGHT BE GIVEN TO THAT AND YOU KNOW INTO WHAT WE CAN DO TO BE OF ASSISTANCE IN THAT REGARD- CLOTH THE LAST QUESTION EIGHT I THINK I HAVE- ON THIS SIDE- I'M THE DIRECTOR SIDE OF THINGS IS- OFF ON THE FRAUD ISSUE. IS THERE A TO BLINDER HOTLINE AT EIGHT I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT- FRAUD INFORMATION COMING IN SOMEHOW INCOMING- GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF WHY I'M ASKING THE QUESTION THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL THAT ARE ON MY MIND I RECEIVED A TEXT YESTERDAY UNSOLICITED SENIOR EDT PREPAID DEBIT CARD HAS BEEN SUSPENDED I DON'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE- I'D LIKE TO TURN. TURN THIS INTO SOMEBODY OF THE FOLLOW UP OBVIOUSLY YOU PRESENTLY THAT'S- SOME SORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY EVENTUALLY HAS TO GET A HOLD OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT- DO YOU HAVE A TIP LINE I MEAN AT LEAST. YOU SEE THAT ACROSS OTHER STATE AGENCIES EVEN FISH AND WILDLIFE SOMEBODY SEE SOMETHING. WRONG GOING ON THEY CAN JUST CALL AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER AND REPORTED. OUT THAT. YES WE DO GREAT WHAT IS A NUMBER. GOOD QUESTION I CAN SHARE THE US SENATOR CORTESE IT'S ONE EIGHT HUNDRED. TWO TWO NINE SIX TWO NINE SEVEN OKAYGREAT- I DON'T KNOW IF MY DISTRICT OFFICE IS AWARE THAT THE WE WILL DO OUR BEST YOU KNOW WITH- YOU KNOW I THINK A LIST SERVE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENROLL THE BROADER COMMUNITY NOT. TO TURN EVERYONE INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS BUT TO THE EXTENT PEOPLE GET WEIRD TEXT MESSAGES EMAILS. THEY'RE HEARING OVER HEARING. SOMETHING THAT THEIR NEIGHBOR SAYS- THEY KNOW SOMEBODY IS- INVOLVED IN NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD BE IN. TRYING TO ENROLL IN THE LISTED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC- IT MOST PEOPLE I TALK TO WANT US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IN THE FUEL HELP US THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SPECIAL ON THE- ON THE FRAUD SIDE SO. THAT'S THE REASON I'M ASKING FOR THE- LAST LEADER KEVIN. SORRY NEED TO VARIOUS WITH EDT- KEEP. THAT I'D- WANTED TO ON THAT WE DID SEND OUT WE HAVE HEARD FROM PEOPLE ON THAT PARTICULAR SCAM. AND WE DID SEND OUT SOME INFORMATION TO THE PRESS TO VOTE LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO CLAIMANTS WE POSTED IT ONLINE BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD THAT THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE- AND SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT. TO OUR ATTENTION- AGAIN BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN WE JUST SENT IT OUT I BELIEVE LAST WEEK WHEN WE FOUND OUT- AND THE SECOND POINT IS- TO YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION ABOUT- RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO AND EDT AS WE DO DO. EXIT INTERVIEWS- AND WE HAVE THEY ARE VOLUNTARY BUT WE HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THAT DATA AND WE DO PLAN ON USING THAT MOVING FORWARD- TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE- YOU KNOW. BASICALLY YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE AND- THERE AND- WORKING CONDITIONS AND- YOU DON'T SEE WHY THEY'RE LEAVING AND IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT. LET'S GO SCREW INTO YOUR- YOU HAVE WAS SOME EXPERTISE IN THAT AREA MISS FERGUSON APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR THE CONFUSION WE JUST WANT TO HELP AGAIN I DON'T THE CAMPUS SAYS THAT ENOUGH TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW MASS ABOUT REACH OF THE CAPABILITY WITHIN. YOU KNOW THE MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARE IN OUR SENATE-DISTRICT WE CAN PUSH OUT INFORMATION REPEATEDLY LIKE THIS TIP LINE AND- TRY TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED- MANAGER MY LAST QUESTION IS JUST- FOR THE AUDITOR. I- BUT BY. MADE A SUGGESTION- I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED AT THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT EITHER INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL- AUDIT SERVICES SHOULD BE- FOCUSED YOU KNOW WITHIN EDT. PRETTY MUCH ON A DAILY BASIS YOU KNOW UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE UNTIL WE'RE WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE- YOU KNOW WE FEEL WE'RE OUT OF THE WOODS I DON'T. NO WHAT THE INTENSITY OF YOUR- ARMS. EFFORTS ARE AT THIS POINT A MISTER HARRIS ALTHOUGH I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH HOW MUCH YOU ARE AWARE OF THE PROGRESS HOPE HOW DETAILED YOUR REPORT WAS. YOU KNOW HOW DETAILED THE SEWERAGE REPORT IS SO OBVIOUSLY YOUR YOUR OFFICE IS SPENDING A LOT OF TIME. IN OVERSIGHT BUT COULD IF YOU COULD JUST DESCRIBE. A VERY QUICKLY IF YOU WILL YOU KNOW WHAT THAT. INTENSIVE EFFORT- REMAIN THIS WAY FOR LOOKS LIKE ON YOUR ON YOUR OFFICES PART AT THIS POINT. FINALLY HAVE A TO DO SO SENATOR SO. WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS MONITORING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE'RE DOING THAT AT SCHEDULED INTERVALS- AT A MINIMUM AND THOSE ARE EVERY NINETY DAYS SO EVERY NINETY DAYS WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO TO PROVIDE US AN UPDATE. AT ITS PROGRESS IN ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO IT. WHEN WE DO ONCE WE RECEIVE THAT UPDATE FROM EDG AS WE REVIEW IT AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT PROGRESS SO FOR EXAMPLE- REVIEWING THAT IT HAS IS A WORK FORCE PLAN FOR INSTANCE AND LOOKING AT THAT PLAN AND SEEING DOES THAT COMPORT WITH ALL OF. THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE RECOMMENDED EATING MAC. ONCE WE COMPLETE THAT ASSESSMENT FAMILY REACH THOSE CONCLUSIONS LIKE THE ONES IN THE DOCUMENT WE PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY ABOUT WHAT IS THE STATUS OF. THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE ARE ENGAGED IN REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH EDG AS IT PROVIDES US THOSE UPDATES AND DOING A REVIEW OF DOCUMENTATION IT'S NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE TAX THEY PROVIDE TO US IT'S ALSO ASKING FOR SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AS WELL. AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THOSE FOLLOW UPS- AND SO IT'S NOT RELEVANT ANYMORE AND WE AGREED THAT ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FULLY ADDRESSED AND FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND CERTAINLY WE HAVE. AS WELL STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND THE OPTION TO- CONDUCT ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP WORK IF WE FIND THAT THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY. THANK YOU THROUGH THE TRUTH THANK YOU MISTER HARRISON AND AGAIN AND IT AYE I WANT TO FRAME- IN RETROSPECT THE HER MY QUESTION IS NOT AN INTEREST IN HAVING THE AUDITOR HOWEVER- OR- GETTING. IN X. SCRUTINY. BUT THE PICKUP ISSUES WERE ON ISSUES THAT MAY GET OFF TRACK OR- OR MAKE SUGGESTIONS OF ME PUT THINGS BACK ON TRACK I THINK THE RETENTION ISSUES A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT MEANWHILE WAIT NINETY DAYS. TO COME IN AND SAY JEEZ WE GOT A RETENTION PROBLEM AND I'M NOT I'M NOT LAYING THERE YOUR DOORSTEP. I'M ACTUALLY SAYING THAT. YOU'RE IN A VERY GOOD POSITION. IF YOU'RE REGULARLY OVERSEEING THINGS TO GIVE. BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WITHIN A REPORT TO SAY. WE HAVE SOME MORE SUGGESTIONS HERE. A TO KEEP US OFF THE- THE HUMAN RESOURCES TREADMILL AND HERE'S WHAT THEY ARE IN- THOSE. THAT THIRTY PERCENT. IT HAS GOT TO BE. A DEVASTATING ISSUE IN TERMS OF KEEPING UP WITH CASELOAD AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A DEVASTATING RAW ISSUE FOR THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE STILL THERE TO SEE PEOPLE TO SEE THAT KIND OF ATTRITION SO- I'M KIND OF FOCUSED ON THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHY. MORE IN A MINUTE- OVERSIGHT WRITTEN RECOMMENDATIONS- YOU KNOW MIGHT BE PREFERABLE THAT SAID AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE VERY DETAILED REPORT TODAY APPRECIATED VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MANAGER. YES SENATOR NEWMAN I WOULD I WOULD I HAVE ONE QUESTION HOPEFULLY IS REALLY QUICK I THINK IT'S FOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR WILLIAMS. AND IT'S ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE LIAISONS BACK TO WHAT ONE OF THE ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENTS IS THE ASSIGNMENT. OF SPECIFIC LIAISONS TO OFFICES- AND SO I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A NET POSITIVE FOR US BUT I JUST WANNA GIVE SOME FEEDBACK I I'M TOLD THAT THE WAY IT WORKS IS- IT'S COMING MY OFFICE THAT THAT. THAT WE HAVE A DEDICATED PERSON THAT'S HANDLING THIS MASSIVE LOAD OF CONSTITUENT COMPLAINTS. AND NEEDS- AND SHE GETS FOUR HOURS A WEEK WITH OUR DEDICATED LIAISON IT'S BROKEN UP ACROSS THREE DAYS- AND WANT TO GIVE THE FEEDBACK THAT THEY APPARENTLY THAT IS NOT ENOUGH AND I WOULD FOR THE SAME THING FROM. OTHER OFFICES OR DO I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT HERE- AND I GUESS ASK THE QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW IS IT POSSIBLE AND- DIED NOW THAT WE'VE GIVEN YOU THAT FEEDBACK- THAT WE COULD ALLOCATE SOME MORE MANPOWER TO THAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU MULTIPLY IT BY. HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATORS BUT BUT I THINK IS PROBABLY NECESSARY- AND SO IT YOU KNOW IF YOU COULD NOT BE TAKE THAT AS INPUT BUT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR RESPONSE. THANK YOU FOR. YOUR QUESTION- I THINK THE QUESTION IS BEST ANSWERED BY THE LEGISLATIVE DEPUTY. KEVIN YES THANK YOU SUTTER NEWMAN. WE'VE HEARD THE FEEDBACK AS WELL- WE- TRIED TO TAKE MANY STEPS TO. EASE THE BURDEN ON YOUR DISTRICT OFFICES BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THAT CASELOAD- LIKE THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED TO ME. RECENTLY AUGMENTED A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE STAFF TO WORK ON. LEGISLATIVE REFERRALS- AND- REALIZE THAT THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ADDRESS- WHAT THE OFFICERS ARE CURRENTLY DEALING ONE SO. THE YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATION ARE WORKING WITH LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- WHAT SORT OF SOLUTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TIME TO HELP EASE THAT BURDEN AND- AS SOON AS THERE HAS BEEN- SOLUTION AGREED TO WE WILL BE SURE TO MAKE OFFICERS AWARE OF THAT VERY GOOD I APPRECIATE THAT SO I'M TOLD AND EASY AT LEAST PARTIAL SOLUTIONS JUST TO ALLOCATE MORE TIME. AND I SAID YOU COULD TAKE THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION PRITCHETT UNDERSTOOD. YEAH CAROL WILLIAMS. AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK- WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF TO COME TO A RESOLUTION AND- SOME TERMS THAT WE CAN RELIEVE THE BURDEN AS WELL AS PRIMARILY. CLOSE THE CASES SERVE THE CLAIMANTS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE FEEDBACK WE APPRECIATE IT. YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBERS- I ALSO WANT TO. REINFORCE WHAT SENATOR NEWMAN WAS TALKING ABOUT I'VE HAD. THE EQUIVALENT OF THREE FULL TIME PEOPLE DURING THIS LAST YEAR WORKING ON- CASES ADD CASES L. AND IT STARTED TO MAKE A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN A PARTICULAR PERSON WAS ASSIGNED EVEN IF IT WAS FEET EIGHT LOOK FORWARD. TO THE FEW HOURS THAT THEY HAVE WITH THIS LADY IS ON BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY SOLVE THE CASES WHICH THEY ARE MOSTLY UNABLE TO DO THEMSELVES IF THEY YOU KNOW JUST TRY DIRECTLY WITH THE D. D. SO. IT'S PROVEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL THE ISSUE THAT THAT'S NOT THE CORE ISSUE THOUGH THAT'S NOT THE REAL PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM. THAT IS ALREADY EXISTS AS FAR AS NOT ET DE NOT BE IN A POSITION TO SOLVE ALL THESE CASES DIRECTLY ON YOUR OWNBECAUSE- WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN OUR OFFICE ADDRESSING THIS. DISC I WANNA THANK YOU AS CENTER GROVE HAS- AND OTHERS ARE ON THE COMMITTEE OF FOR JUMPING INTO THIS AND- BEING COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO TAKE ALL THE OF THE CRITICISM THE PUBLICITY AROUND THIS YEAR REALLY UNDER A MAGNIFYING GLASS- AND YET WE STILL FIND OURSELVES YOU FIND YOURSELVES WITH SOME OF THE SERIOUS ISSUES SO I JUST HAVE A AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR THE A LANGUAGE ACCESS ISSUES I KNOW MORE WORK HAS TO BE DONE ON THAT BUT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR ME. IF IT'S SOME OF THE BENEFITS SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT- WHAT WHAT IS THE TIMELINE. YOU SEE ON ON THAT. THE QUESTION WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER. A PLAN TO. WORK WITH A VENDOR. TO BRING TOGETHER ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE- I. T. BRANCH HAS. ANY OF THE ARE REALLY. YOU KNOW WE SPENT TIME OUT WITH THE INITIAL. STAR SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE BEST OF THAT INFORMATION. WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MASS WHAT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WORKFORCE. AGENCIES AND WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE OTHER OF STATE AND SOME OF THE STATE'S ACTUALLY HAD A NEW SYSTEM WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED AND WE'VE ALL LEARNED THAT THOSE SYSTEMS WERE INSUFFICIENT. AND WE'RE GOING TO RESEARCH ANY NEW SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THE ACT TIMELINE IS STILL BEING WORKED ON BUT I EXPECT TO SEE SOME PROGRESS BAR BEFORE THE FALL. AT SOME PROGRESS WITH REGARDS TO PUTTING THE LINE TOGETHER OR WITH REGARDS TO THE PROJECT ITSELF ON WHAT IT WILL PROJECT ITSELF OUR OUR DEBTTHINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION DISHES FOR A ARE PLANNING FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO. HOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU I WANT TO GIVE THE COMMITTEE AN EXAMPLE. ONE OF THE OUR TRADITIONAL WAYS OF APPROACHING. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS WHAT IS CALLED A WATERFALL APPROACH. AND IN THAT APPROACH YOU BUILD AND BUILD AND BUILD AND BUILD THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM GOES LIVE AND YOU DISCOVER ALL THE PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS USING THE NEWER APPROACH WHICH IS THE AGILE APPROACH IN WHICH PART OF THE SYSTEM ARE RELEASED GRADUALLY. IN ADDITION TO THAT RATHER THAN BUILDING NUMBER THE HE MUST OF- OF THE SYSTEM WE'RE LOOKING AT CREATING A SMALL AN AGILE SYSTEM AND ADDING OFF THE SHELVES. OF PRODUCTS THAT CAN HELP US. WHAT THEY CALL MODULES TO HELP US TO KEEP THE SYSTEM FLEXIBLE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT KEEPING DOWN THE COST BUT ALSO MAKING THE SYSTEM SMALLER FLEXIBLE AND- THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT PLANNING. PROCESS IS GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO APPROACH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW SYSTEM. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU MAY AND WILL BE AVAILABLE YOU THINK BY THE FALL. WELL I THINK WE'LL HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BY THE FALL. OKAY AND- ONE UP AND I TRIED TO GO THROUGH THIS THE LIST OF ALL THE AUDITORS- ISSUES AND- AND YOUR- YOU ARE MAKING PROGRESS YEAR SEEM TO BE MOSTLY ON THE TIME LINE BUT IF YOU COULD JUST ANSWER THE ISSUE RAISED BY THE AUDITOR TODAY ON WORKLOAD SCENARIOS AND HOW YOU'RE- ADDRESSING THOSE.

WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET THIS FIXED OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT THAT WAS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEMS ARE OUR FINAL ISSUE IS ISSUE OF THIS AGENDA IS ISSUE NINETEEN THE MULTI YEAR INVESTMENT STRATEGY. FOR CAL STIRS OF WILL THE DEPARTMENT PLEASE. PRESENT. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS SO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JULIE UNDERWOOD AND I AM THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM THAT THIS ITEM SUMMARIZES CAL STIRS MULTI YEAR INTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BCP THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE TEACHERS RETIREMENT BOARD NOW THIS B. C. P. ALLIANCE WITH OUR INVESTMENT BELIEF NUMBER THREE WHICH IS MANAGING INVESTMENT COSTS YIELD LONG TERM BENEFITS IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL TO CONTINUE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COLLABORATIVE MODEL BY LEVERAGING CANCERS RESOURCES. NOW THE PLAN DOES PROVIDE FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR POSITIONS TO BE UTILIZED OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD AT A BUDGETARY COST OF THIRTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION THAT THESE POSITIONS WILL BE DEPLOYED OVER SIXTEEN DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES AND BUSINESS AREAS THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION THAT WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND THE GROWS IN THE COLLABORATIVE MODEL WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY TO MOVE MORE. INVESTMENTS TO INTERNAL MANAGEMENT. HELPER ARE LATEST BECAUSE REPORT. 4% OF OUR NET ASSET VALUE IS MANAGED BY EXTERNAL MANAGERS WHICH COSTS APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FOR INTERNAL AND HYBRID MANAGEMENT. NOW FROM A NET RETURNS PERSPECTIVE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC MARKET ASSETS IS APPROXIMATELY ONE EIGHT. TO ONE TENTH OF THE COST COMPARED TO HIRING EXTERNAL MANAGERS AND WE'VE ALREADY ACHIEVED QUITE AGGRESSIVE COST SAVINGS THAT WE STARTED GROWING THIS MODEL. SO FOR A COUPLE EXAMPLES OVER THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS WHICH FUNDED SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN INTERNALLY MANAGED PORTFOLIOS. SAVING APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS. WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A HYBRID CALL INVESTMENT THAT WILL REDUCE INCENTIVES AND FEES OF APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IN A RECENT DIRECT LENDING INVESTMENT REDUCE THE STANDARD FEES BY 50% SO NOW WE ANTICIPATE APPROXIMATELY TEN YEAR. TEN YEARS TO SEE TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN ANNUAL COST SAVINGS AND INCREASED RETURNS AS WE GROW THIS MODEL. THE OVERALL THIS IS THE COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES IT WILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDE LONG TERM COST SAVINGS TO THE TEACHERS RETIREMENT FUND WHICH SUPPORTS THE STATE'S DIRECTIVES TO MITIGATE COSTS. THESE EFFORTS ARE PROJECTED TO FAR OUTWEIGH THE COST OF THIS REQUEST LONG TERM. AND COULD CREATE ENOUGH SAVINGS TO KEEP ANNUAL PORTFOLIO COSTS AT OUR CURRENT LEVELS TEN YEARS FROM NOW DESPITE THE PORTFOLIO GROWING BY PROJECTED A PROJECTED FIFTY PERCENT. YEAH WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A LARGE ADDITION TO RESOURCES DURING AN UNPRECEDENTED TIME SO OUR GOAL IS TO BE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE COST SAVINGS ACHIEVED THROUGH THIS MODEL. SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO EXPANDING OUR ANNUAL COST REPORTS THAT ARE PRESENTED TO OUR BOARD TO SHOW OUR SUCCESS OVER TIME AND GROWING THIS MODEL WE ALSO PLAN TO HIRE A THIRD PARTY TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY OUR CAP OUR OUR CALCULATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL ASSURANCE. SO IS THAT ARE DEPUTY CHIEF AND OFFICER SCOTT JANICE ALSO TODAY AND WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU THAT'S MISS UNDERWOOD RIGHT.

WE WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN CORPORATIONS WE'VE CONCLUDED THE DISCUSSIONS FOR PART A WE WILL NOW RECESS FOR MAX FIVE MINUTES AND RECONVENE TO HEAR PART B. OF THE AGENDA.

OF THE AGENDA TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN VOTE- THE VOTES WERE PART EIGHT I AM SO AGAIN. WE HAVE. SHAKLEE MAXIMUM FIVE MINUTES. THE GERMAN FIVE MINUTES I THINK CAMINO DEL. THE SENATE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO PART B. OF THE AGENDA WHICH COVERS PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUDICIARY ISSUES OUR FIRST FIRST ISSUE ON PART B. WILL DISCUSS THE POLICY IN BUDGET IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH CALIFORNIA'S FINES AND FEES STRUCTURE ANITA LEE FROM THE L. A. O. WILL KICK THINGS OFF WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM FOLLOWED BY BRANDON GREEN DIRECTOR RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE PROGRAM AT ACLU FOUNDATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND SHELLEY CURRAN. ACTOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES- MISLI WOULD YOU PLEASE BEGIN. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IMMEDIATELY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I AM GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN AND HOPEFULLY YOU ARE ABLE TO SEE THE HAND OUT- ARE YOU ABLE TO SEE THAT MADAM CHAIR YES OKAY GREAT- SO WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATE'S CRIMINAL FINANCED THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS TO HIGHLIGHT SOME ACTIONS AND CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS- PART OF THE PRIOR YEAR AND ALSO THE PROPOSED BUDGET IS ONLY USING THIS CANNOT AS A GUIDE- THIS CANNOT IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE L. A. A WEBSITE FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT- WE TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL FINES AND FEES WERE COLLECTIVELY REFERRING TO ALL OF THE ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE CHARGED FROM INDIVIDUALS ARE CONVICTED OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES. WHICH INCLUDE TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS. TWENTY TO PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT TABLE THE FIGURE BEFORE YOU. THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOLLOWED BY AN INDIVIDUAL STARTS WITH THE BASELINE THE VERY FIRST LINE ITEM ON THE FIGURE. OUT A NUMBER OF OTHER CHARGES ARE ADDED SOME OF WHICH ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED AND SOME ARE PERMITTED BASED ON THE VIOLATION OR OTHER FACTORS. INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO ASK THAT THECOURTS AND JUST THE AMOUNT OWED BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY AND JUDGES DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO WAIVE OR REDUCE CERTAIN CHARGES. TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT. THE FIGURE BEFORE YOU ILLUSTRATES THAT THE TOTAL FINE IF YOU LEVELS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME. THESE FINDINGS THE LEVELS ARE SET TO SERVE MULTIPLE PURPOSES- SOME OF THEM ARE TIED TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIME WHILE OTHERS ARE USED TO GENERATE REVENUE TO FUND PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES FOR TO HELP OFFSET STATE AND LOCAL COSTS FOR PROVIDING CERTAIN SERVICES. TURNING TO PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT. BOTH COUNTIES AND COURTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE COLLECTION PROCESS THE COUNTIES ARE STATUTORILY RESPONSIBLE- BOTH THE COUNTY'S AIRPORT CAN ALSO CONTRACT WITH PRIVATE COLLECTION VENDORS OR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO HELP WITH THIS AS WELL. THE COLLECTION PROGRAMS USE A VARIETY OF TOOLS. TO HELP INDIVIDUALS EITHER PROVIDE PAYMENT IN FULL IMMEDIATELY OR TO SET UP AND REMAIN CURRENT ON THEIR INSTALLMENT PLANS. IF AN INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT PAY ON TIME THE AMOUNT OWED IT DOES BECOME DELINQUENT AND AFTER THE APPROPRIATE NOTIFICATION SANCTIONS CAN THEN BE APPLIED. THE COLLECTION PROGRAMS GENERALLY VERY AND HOW AND WHEN THOSE SANCTIONS ARE USED BUT THEY TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN PROGRESSIVELY TO INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON THE INDIVIDUAL. AND TO COMMENT SECTIONS INCLUDE A CIVIL ASSESSMENT OF UP TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR FAILING TO PAY OR APPEAR WITHOUT THE CLASS. AS WELL AS. WE AGE GARNISHMENT AND BANK LEVIES. AT THE END TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THE G. BRANCH OF ABOUT POINTS BILLION REMAINED OUTSTANDING THE MINUTES OF THE- TURNING TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND HOW. STATE LAW ONCE TIS MONEY IS COLLECTED DICTATES A VERY COMPLEX PROCESS FOR DISTRIBUTING THE FINANCIER OF THE NEW TWENTY NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE STATE AND LOCAL FINDS. THE STATE GENERALLY RECEIVES A MAJORITY OF THE REVENUE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT RECEIVING A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN 40% AND THEN THE REMAINDER- SUPPORTS THE COLLECTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE COLLECTING DELINQUENT PAYMENTS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT COLLECTED HAS VERY LITTLE MILE DISTRIBUTED TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS DECLINED SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN ELEVEN. AS A RESULT A NUMBER OF STATE FUNDS THAT RECEIVE THIS TYPE OF ROMANIANS HAVE FACED FUNDING SHORTFALLS. AND BECOME INSOLVENT. THE TRYING TO PAY SIX OF YOUR HAND OUT- AGREES BUDGETS AS WELL AS THE CURRENT PROPOSED ONE WHICH I'M INCLUDE VARIOUS ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE DECLINE IN THIS FINANCIALLY REVENUE. AND WE'RE GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE SO FIRST- THE STATE HAS SHIFTED COSTS FROM VARIOUS FUND SUPPORTED THIS BY THIS REVENUE TO THE GENERAL FUND OR TO OTHER FINES- IN DIFFERENT YEARS. IN SOME CASES IT'S THE WHOLE SHALL SIXTEEN OF PRODUCT OF PROGRAMS AND OTHER CASES OF TOBACCO. SO AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CAUTIOUS INCLUDING PROPOSALS FOR AN ONGOING GENERAL PLANS BACK FILL OF BOTH THE DNA IDENTIFICATION FIND AS. WELL AS THE RESTITUTION FINES- S. ACTION THAT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN BUDGET IS THE STATE HAS. CERTAIN STATE ENTITIES SUPPORTED BY THIS REVENUE TO REDUCE OUR EXPENDITURES. IN CERTAIN YEARS. A THIRD ACTION IS THAT THE STATE HAS ALSO ATTEMPTED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FINANCING REVENUE COLLECTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THE FOR EXAMPLE FTV DID RECEIVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET. FOR COLLECTION FOR INCREASED COLLECTION ACTIVITIES. TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN IN YOUR HAND OUT I'M KIND OF A COUPLE OF OTHERS AS YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET. THE STATE ACTUALLY ELIMINATED SOME OF THE STATUTORY FORMULAS DICTATING SPECIFICALLY HOW CERTAIN FUNDS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED AND INSTEAD SHIFTED TO A PROCESS WHERE FUNDS WERE APPROPRIATED- BASED ON IN STATE PRIORITIES INSTEAD. AND THE FINAL ONE WE HIGHLIGHT FOR HERE AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO CONSOLIDATE THE JUDICIAL BRANCHES TO CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS TO DELAY THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE INSOLVENCY OF THE ACCOUNTS. TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT YOUR HAND OUT. THE STATE BUDGET HAS ALSO INCLUDED ACTIONS TO REDUCE IMPACTS OF FINES AND FEES ON INDIVIDUALS AND I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE. THE FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PACKAGE AUTHORIZED A PILOT PROGRAM TO FACILITATE THE ONLINE EDUCATION AND ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATIONS. FOR CERTAIN TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS AT A MINIMUM OF EIGHT CORE. THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE THIS KIND OF PROGRAM AND EXPAND THE STATE THE ONLINE EDUCATION AND THE ABILITY TO PAY STATEWIDE. AS WELL AS TO APPLY TO ALL INFRACTIONS AND TO BACK FILL THE EXPECTED REDUCTION IN THE CRIMINAL. FINANCIALLY REVENUE THAT WOULD BE COLLECTED. A SECOND AT LEAST- IS THAT AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET THE ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES WILL BE ELIMINATED AS OF JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WAS SET ASIDE- TO PROVIDE COUNTIES WITH THE BACK FELL OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS- AND SO PURSUANT TO THE LANGUAGE IN THAT IN THAT BUDGET PACKAGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON FINALIZING THE METHODOLOGY TO ALLOCATE THAT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BACK SO. INTERNING TO THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HANDOUT- THERE ARE TWO OTHER ACTIONS TAKEN IN RECENT BUDGET THAT WE WOULD HAVE LIKED YOUR ATTENTION. THE FIRST IS A PART OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BUDGET PACKAGE THAT IT DID INCLUDE A TRAFFIC AMNESTY- PROPOSAL. IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THEIR CIVIL ASSESSMENTS WAVES THE TOTAL AMOUNT BE REDUCED. THE TOTAL NUMBER EIGHT OLD REDUCED AS WELL AS THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSES RESTORED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. AND THEN AS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET- ELIMINATED THE COLLECTION PROGRAMS ABILITY TO USE DRIVER'S LICENSES HOLDS AND SUSPENSIONS AS A COLLECTION SANCTION. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO FAIL TO PAY THEIR CRIMINAL FINES AND FEES. SO HOPEFULLY THIS IS A HELPFUL. OVERVIEW FOR THAT SHE SET UP THE REST THE DISCUSSION FROM PANEL WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE A PROVIDE DETAIL- IF NECESSARY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISLI APPRECIATE THAT PRESENTATION AND MAKE. FROM MR GREEN FROM THE ACLU PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON. GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON BRINGING DURING DIRECT RUSSIAN ECONOMIC JUSTICE PROGRAM AT THE ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY- I FIRST WANT TO JUST. NO FED WHAT IS PROPOSED IS NOT MERELY AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE SERVE BUDGET FUNDING ISSUE WHAT IS THE ISSUE THAT SORT OF INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO THE RACIALIZATION OF POLICING AND THE CRIMINALIZATION OF BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY- THAT FIND A FEES IN TRAFFIC- FOR TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE- IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED TO THE WAY IN WHICH BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES ARE. OVER POLICED- PULLED OVER A MORE FREQUENT BREAKS. HAVE THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE MAY BE A MORE FREQUENTLY BREAKS THE EXTENT- AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT IS REALLY CONNECTED TO SORT OF THE REPARATIONS DISCUSSIONS- THAT HAVE BEGUN- SOME OF THE OTHER RACIAL JUSTICE. LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND BILLS THAT WERE PASSED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WEALTHY STRETCHING FROM BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES SO THIS IS NOT ONLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHRINK THE REACH OF THE RACIALIZED SYSTEM BUT ALSO LEVY EIGHT ECONOMIC ARMSTRONG BY THE SYSTEM. MAKES ONE NECESSARY STEP TOWARDS BRINGING VISIONING THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. AS IT RELATES TO BRILEY- ABILITY TO PAY- I JUST WANT TO NOTE DAY- FOR EXAMPLE I WORKED AT THE STATION LAWCENTER DURING THE TRAFFIC AMNESTY- HIGHLY. AND WE HAVE SEEN OF BOTH- IN SORT OF LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION AND JUST OVER TIME DATE ABILITY TO PAY- IS INEFFECTIVE- IS AN EFFECTIVE BOTH AT ADDRESSING THIS SORT OF RACIALIZED NATURE OF ALL THAT IS INEFFECTIVE AND- FULL THE ADDRESSING SORT OF ECONOMIC. SANCTIONS IN THE WEALTH EXTRACTION BROUGHT ON BY THIS- SYSTEM AND CREATES- ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THAT LOOK VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM. COURT TO COURT I TYPICALLY UTILIZING- SORT OF ECONOMIC REQUIREMENTS THEY DON'T- WITHIN GET TO SORT OF. THE NATURE OF THE RACIALIZED WEALTH GAP IN THE ACTUAL EXPENSE OF LIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS WHY THE COALITION THAT I'M PART OF THE DEBT FREE JUSTICE COALITION- HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR AND ADVOCATING FOR- ABOLITION NOT ONLY IS IT SORT OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT. MEANS OF GETTING RID OF THIS RACIALIZED WHAT THE EXTRACTION SYSTEM BUT IT ALSO- IS THE MOST FAIR AND JESS AND SO. WE WAITED- URGE- A MINISTRATION LEGISLATION TO AGAIN TAKE ACTION TOWARDS- A RADIC HATING THE SEASON AND JUST. SORT OF PROPPING UP IN ABILITY PAY SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE. INEFFECTIVE BUT ALSO DOESN'T FULLY ADDRESS THE RACIALIZED POLICING BAD BRINGS ABOUT THE DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF. FINES FEES AND WHAT THE TRACTION. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER- WE ASKED THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF SHELLEY CURRENT TO PLEASE PRESENT. YES A GOOD AFTERNOON- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MADAM CHAIR I'M SHELLEY KERN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES OFFICE- I AM SPOKE TO YOU A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO ABOUT- SOME OF THE RESULTS OF THE ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM THAT WE'VE SEEN TO DATE- AND SO I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE TOO LONG AND REALLY. HAVE TIME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT I JUST JUST TO UPDATE YOU OF THAT AND READ AND REMIND FOLKS OF THE PROGRAM. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WAS ONE OF FIVE STATE COURT SYSTEMS- TO RECEIVE A PRICE OF JUSTICE GRANT UNDER THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A TOOL- TO DO ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATIONS THE LEGISLATURE SUPPLEMENTED THAT FUNDING IS MOSTLY MENTIONED- AND EXPANDED THE PROGRAM TO ADDITIONAL PILOTS. GOVERNOR NUISANCE BUDGET PROPOSAL EXPANDS ATP TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT TRIAL COURTS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND AS MISLI MENTIONED IT PROVIDES BACK FEEL TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH FOR THAT LOST REVENUE TWELVE MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND FIFTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION- IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND ONWARDS. EIGHTY P. IS NOW AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME CONSUMERS INSEVEN COUNTIES AND WE ARE PLEASED WITH WITH THE RESULTS TO DATE WHEN THE PILOT LANGUAGE WAS ADOPTED- THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED THAT THE TOOL RECOMMEND AT LEAST A 50% REDUCTION THE AVERAGE REDUCTION THE COURTS ARE MAKING IS 54% OF COURTS FOLLOW THIS TOOL RECOMMENDATION MOST OF THE TIME WITH OVER 70% OF REDUCTIONS WITHIN TEN DOLLARS OF THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT. AND THIS SAVES THE AVERAGE LOW AND CONSUMER SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS EIGHTY P. ALSO ADDRESSES THE ISSUE A LICENSE SUSPENSION AN ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT FOR MANY YEARS NOW USING EIGHTY P. COUNTS AS AN APPEARANCE SO USERS AVOID FAILURE TO APPEAR CITATIONS WITH NO SUBSEQUENT LICENSE HOLDS AND NO SIMPLE ASSESSMENTS. AS OF MAY FIFTH NEARLY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND REQUESTS WERE APPROVED FROM OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND LITIGANTS- AND. AND A TOTAL OF SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS- THE APPROVED AND WE- ACROSS NINE TWO PER. OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS LIVE BELOW 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LIMIT LIMIT. AND USERS LIKE THE TOOL WE CONDUCT AN ONLINE SURVEY TO GET USER FEEDBACK- WITHOUT THE TOOL. USERS HAVE TO- TRAVEL TO COURT TO ASK FOR A REDUCTION IN THERE AND THE AMOUNT OF. AND THIS ACTUALLY ADDS TO THE COST OF BY TRANSPORTATION OR CHILDCARE OR TAKING A DAY OFF OF WORK. WHEN WE DEVELOP THE TOOL WE RECEIVED INPUT FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAKE THE TOOLS ACCESSIBLE AS POSSIBLE. AND SO IN RESPONSE TO SOME DAY THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED- WE MADE THE TOOL AVAILABLE ON DESKTOPS. AND TABLETS AND ON SMARTPHONES. WHICH WAS AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND HAS A CHATBOT FUNCTION IN BOTH OF THOSE AS WELL. AT LEAST WE SURVEY USERS AND OVER 92% OF RESPONDENTS FELT THAT THE ABILITY TO PAY TOOL WAS HELPFUL- IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT- WHY IT IS THAT THEY THEY FOUND IT HELPFUL AND WHAT MADE IT DIFFICULT TO COME TO COURT THEY SAID- TAKING TIME OFF WORK AND FINING TRANSPORTATION WITH THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT THEY IDENTIFIED. THAT WE REQUESTED THE- THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL AND I'M. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY MEMBERS COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SALINAS OKAY- I JUST WANT TO ASK HERE. HELLO THERE WERE SEVERAL OFTHE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED WITH THE PILOTS CREATION WAS THE- THAT THE REDUCTION IN FEES AND FINES WERE OPTIONAL- IT RECOMMENDED A FIFTY PERCENT- A REDUCTION OF FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO UP MET A CERTAIN NOT THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL 125% POP SO CONSIDER WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC- AND- OF. OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE NEED TO RELIEVE ANY FINANCIAL BARRIERS. OF HAS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL RECONSIDERED CHANGES TO THE ELIGIBILITY PERCENT REDUCTION OR MANDATES- USE OF THE TOOL. WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND- WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT- DIFFERENT PERCENT PROVISIONS IN THE LEGISLATION I WILL POINT OUT THAT THAT MINIMUM 50% REQUIREMENT IS ACTUALLY INCLUDED AND STATUTE THAT WAS SOMETHING- THAT WAS DISCUSSED WHEN THE ORIGINAL PILOTS WERE INCLUDED- AT THE REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE- THAT LEGISLATION WAS AMENDED TO ACTUALLY PUT THAT 50% AND SO AS I SAID WHERE WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ON. THE SAY THAT ALL THE COURTS ARE MADE A REQUIREMENT THAT A MINIMUM OF REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE TOOL ITSELF RECOMMENDED A 50% REDUCTION THE AVERAGE REDUCTION AMONG ALL OF THE REDUCTIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IS ABOUT 54% THERE'S A RANGE AMONG THE COURTS SOME COURTS ARE JUST BELOW 50% OTHER COURTS ARE UP REDUCTION THAT THEY PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS. SO THAT AMOUNT IS STILL- OPTIONAL AS FAR AS- WHETHER OR NOT MEET THE FIFTY PERCENT. YES I'M A WITCH IN ORDER TO PROVIDE- JUDICIAL DISCRETION YES IT'S- IT'S OPTIONAL- C. AND THEN JUST GIVE ME GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE KIND OF WALK ME THROUGH WHY WOULD IT A JUDICIAL OFFICER NOT RECOMMEND A REDUCTION OF TO SOMEONE WHO IS QUALIFIED. SO ABOUT 75% OF THE- OF OTHER REQUESTS THAT ARE MADE ARE APPROVED BY THE JUDICIAL OFFICER WE'VE GONE THROUGH ON COLLECTED DATA ON THE REASONS THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ACCEPTED 75% OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN REJECTED. WERE REJECTED FOR REASONS LIKE- THE PERSON HAS A MISDEMEANOR IN THE CITATION MISDEMEANORS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE REQUESTED TO DUPLICATE OF ONE ALREADY UNDER REVIEW- THEY'VE ALREADY SCHEDULED A COURT DATE- THEY HAVE A FIX IT TICKET AND THEY MIGHT BE ENCOURAGED TO COME IN AND FIX THE TICKET AND HAVE THE FEE WAIVED. THERE ARE OTHER INSTANCES WHERE THE PERSON'S INCOME ELIGIBILITY IS HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT WOULD BE ANOTHER REASON BUT WE ARE SEEING ABOUT A SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT- FIVE APPROVAL RATES OF THE OF THE REQUESTS THAT ARE MADE. I THINK THAT JUST THE ISSUE OF WORK WHAT ARE WE FACING HERE. EIGHT POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN FINES AND FEES REMAIN OUTSTANDING THAT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF MONEY OWED BY INDIVIDUALS- SO THAT'S MY CONCERN IS ARE WE REALLY IT REMINDS ME OF THE OTHER- LAST YEAR IN THE DAM- SENATOR MITCHELL RAISED AND THAT WE RAISED ABOUT FEES JUST ACCUMULATING. ARE OVER AND OVER YEAR AFTER YEAR WE'RE NOT COLLECTING THEM SO WHERE DO WE WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT OTHER THAN IT JUST HANGS OVER AND CAUSES ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PROBLEMS FOR THOSE WHO- SO- THAT'S MY CONCERN IS. ARE WE REALLY GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THIS OTHER THAN- OF PLACING THAT PRESSURE ON PEOPLE TO PAY WHEN THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. ABOUT THAT. I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- THE FILM CATALYST FOR DOING THIS PROGRAM IS TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC NEEDS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE AN ABILITY TO PAY AND SO IT REALLY IS A PROACTIVE STEP. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO PEOPLE AND TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS AS I ALREADY MENTIONED RIGHT WHEN SOMEONE HAS TO GO INTO COURT AND TAKE A DAY OFF OF WORK OR GET CHILD CARE- THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF BURDENS AND THE OBSTACLES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO- TRYING TO ALLEVIATE WITH THE ADOPTION OF THIS PROGRAM. YEAH PLUS THE FACT PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. YES- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER- MISTER BRANDON GREEN. YES I'M SORRY COULD YOU COULD YOU SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT AS WELL. SURE SO- AS I MENTIONED- PREVIOUSLY I CO LED THE DECOMPOSITION PROBABLY CONNECT THE STAKING LAWCENTER AND PRIMARILY- WHAT WE DID IN THAT CLINIC WAS ADVOCATE FOR FOLKS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT- AND SO- YOU KNOW THIS THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN KIND OF- MAKE MORE- FACING SORT OF LIKE THE INJUSTICE THAT ALREADY HAPPENS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SEE ON THE GROUND SO FOR EXAMPLE- IF THE AVERAGE- IF THERE'S- THAT MUCH LEEWAY BETWEEN THE- REDUCTIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING BETWEEN FIFTY AND SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT. AND THAT MEANS DEPENDING UPON WHERE YOU'RE GETTING YOUR TICKET FOR EXAMPLE HEY- THE PRODUCTION THAT YOU GET MIGHT BE HIGHER WHEN PLACING IN ANOTHER PLACE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT IT TOOK US YEARS TO SORT OF PUSH THE COURT AWAY FROM USING THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE- TO USE IN THE HOOD STANDARD IN FROM USING THE LOWEST PORTION OF THE HAD STATED TO. THE MEDIUM AND HIGH FORCING BAD READY SORT OF GOT AA- THE COST OF LIVING IN ALAMEDA COUNTY BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO- WHILE THE MAIL IN OAKLAND THE VAST MAJORITY PEOPLE THEY SHE GOING TO SEE- TO BE BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS RIGHT WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AT THE LOWER INCOME BRACKET IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND SO PRIMARILY YOU KNOW AS I SAID IN MY PUBLIC. COMMENT A SECOND GO TO THIS IS THE ISSUE OF OVER CRIMINALIZATION OF BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES- SPECIFICALLY AND SO WHILE IT MAY BE TRUE TODAY- IT'S MORE A FISHING FOR FOLKS NOT TO GO LEAN WE HAD A LOT OF CLIENTS THAT ISSUES BEING ABLE TO GO INTO INTO COURT IF YOU CAN GOING TO COURT AND GET 80% REDUCTION BUT YOU CAN ONLY GET A 50% REDUCTION BY USING THE ONLINE TOOL THEY CAN BE MORE BENEFICIAL FOR YOU TO GO. IN FRONT OF THE COURT OR TO PUT IN THE PAPERWORK AS YOU AFTER DOING ABSOLUTELY COUNTY BUT OVERALL. YOU KNOW I THINK THIS SORT OF- BRIDE. THE BRIDE OF THE REDUCTIONS OF GET TO THE POINT THAT. ABILITY TO PAY JUST AS A MAKING DESIGNED. WORK IT DOESN'T WORK TO SORT OF A LEVY A WITH UNDERLYING ISSUE WITH WE SHOULD. A OVERCOME THIS OR OF THE BLACK AND COMMUNITY WHICH IS WHY- THIS IS PRIMARILY ISSUE OF RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE BECAUSE OF PRIMARILY TALK ABOUT FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE SYSTEM. GREAT THANK YOU MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GREEN- THIS WORD THIS IS A- INFORMATIONAL ITEM ONLY SO NO ACTION IS NEEDED. SURE ALL I'M SORRY A TO LOOK OVER NO I APOLOGIZE SO I AM ACTUALLY THIS IS AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION SO- DID NOT HAVE A QUESTION TO- COULD GET INTERESTING- AND I APPRECIATE MR GREEN'S COMMENTS SO YOU KNOW. WE CLEARLY SHOULDN'T FIND OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON FINE SPRAY THEM INTO THAT THAT- THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENT. AND THE INTENT OF FINANCES TO CREATE A DETERRENT FOR MISBEHAVIOR. WE SHOULD PROBABLY WHAT'S THE LOWEST FINE WE COULD HAVE TO CREATE THE DETERRENT. AND MY QUESTION FOR. ANYBODY HERE IS HAVE WE GIVEN ANY THOUGHT. TO LOOKING AT THIS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION MAYBE INSTEAD OF REDUCING FINES DOWNWARD. WITH RESPECT TO ABILITY TO PAY MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST FIND UPWARD YOU KNOW START AT THE AT THE LOWEST NUMBER IS A DO IN PLACES LIKE SCANDINAVIA- AND DO IT PROGRESSIVELY BASED ON YOUR ABILITY TO PAY BUT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. I SAW THAT POOR PEOPLE ARE BEING PENALIZED SO HAVE HAS THAT EVER BEEN PART OF THE DISCUSSION. SO IT SURE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- IS- IS A DAY FIND MODEL- TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT HASN'T. BEEN CAN I SEE A SEAMLESSLY WITH THEIR HAND UP THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT- WHILE THAT. COULD WORK IN BE MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN THE CURRENT SORT OF REGRESSIVE TAXATION- THAT EXIST. FHWA WE STILL HAVE SORT OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT I'M SPEAKING TO SO- AT THE BACK OF THE ROLL CALL THE SCENE YOU KNOW DID A SERIES OF REPORTS THERE'S INTERACTIVE MAPS THAT SHOW ESSENTIALLY YOU CAN MAP- BLACK BROWN AND- LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND YOU CAN SORT OF DETERMINE. WHERE THE HIGHEST DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSIONS ARE NO DON'T GET ME WRONG I APPRECIATE THAT POINT I'M SAYING YOU KNOW LET'S LEAVE IT LEAVE LEAVING THAT ASIDE FOR A MOMENT. YOU KNOW THERE'S AMAZING PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION WE HAD HERE ABOUT YOU KNOW IS FOR THE PURPOSE- AND ROLL AND USE OF PENALTIES- AND IT IT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THEY WERE LOOKING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION MAYBE MAYBE HIGH INCOME PEOPLE SHOULD VERY. MUCH MORE RIGHTS TO THEIR THEY'VE THE PROPORTIONALLY THE SAME. DISINCENTIVE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS ARE DETERMINES. WHERE WORKING PEOPLE SHOULD PAY LESS. MAYBE THAT SHOULD BE THAT THERE SHOULD BE THE BASELINE. YESTERDAY FOR. MODEL WITH THE- BE INTEREST TO HAVE A- OF. GREAT THANK YOU- MISLI. I'M SO CENTER NEWMAN YOU MIGHT FIND A REPORT THAT WE PUT OUT A COUPLE YEARS INTERESTING IT WAS FINE- IT WAS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE'S. BROADER SYSTEM AND SO ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAD IN THERE WAS THAT WE DID RECOMMEND AN EVALUATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL POINTED THE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S PART OF OUR WORK. WE NOTED THAT WHERE WE ARE NOW INVOLVED FROM BASICALLY LOTS AND LOTS OF STATUTES BEING PASSED OVER NUMEROUS YEARS SORT OF BEING LAYERED ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER AND SORT OF OVER TIME KIND OF THE PURPOSE AND KIND OF WHAT WERE THE GOALS SORT OF GOT LOST AND SO I'VE HEARD OF THAT REEVALUATION. WE SAID THAT THERE WERE FOUR KEY QUESTIONS AND I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION IS THE FIRST AFTER THE FIRST AND SECOND QUESTION ARE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE BROUGHT UP. SO FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT SHOULD BE THE GOALS OF THE SYSTEM AND SO WE LAID OUT THIS CONCEPT OF DETERRENCE VERSUS PROPORTIONAL PUNISHMENT VERSES THE MITIGATION OF CRIME THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE FROM ONE ANOTHER BUT DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE YOU KIND OF APPROACH HOW YOU SET THE LEVELS. ETCETERA AND IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHAT SECOND QUESTION ALSO TIES. TO YOUR COMMENTS IN TERMS OF. WE CALLED IT THE BILL TO PAY IMPORT. AND WE BASICALLY IN KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO THINK ABOUT. AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO PAY ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT WE RAISED WHAT IS THE DEFINED SYSTEM IN TERMS OF CALCULATING IT BASED ON. ON THAT BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS FOR YOU TO ADDRESS PAYMENTS SO THAT. THIS IS RAISING THE ISSUE ABOUT COMMUNITY SERVICE ETCETERA AND JUST TO ROUND IT OFF OF THE THIRD QUESTION IT WHAT IS AND WHAT SHOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES. IF AN INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T PAY AND THE FOURTH WAS IT SHOULD FINES AND FEES BE ADJUSTED. AND SO THAT WAS YOU KNOW SHOULD THEY AUTOMATICALLY BE ADJUSTED IT YOU KNOW SHOULD THERE BE A TIME HERE AND WHERE BY WHICH LEGISLATURE ROUTINELY COMES BACK AND EVALUATES THEM ETCETERA. MY MORE DETAIL OR MORE COME. WITH YOU IF YOU'RE- AND I. IT WOULD BE WEIRD AT THIS POINT I SAID I WASN'T INTERESTED BUT I ACTUALLY AM SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU COULD FOR THAT TO ME I I'D BE GRATEFUL AND I DIE DEPRECIATE. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. MISTER GREEN WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. SORRY JONATHAN ME MYSELF- SPECIFICALLY TO THE ABILITY TO PAY BY THEIR OR MORE BROADLY I'M BECAUSE MORE BROADLY MY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALIGNED WITH- THE COALITION THAT WERE PART OF THE DAY FOR JUST A COALITION WHICH IS ELIMINATION OF FINES AND FEES- YEAH I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF OUR- FANTASIES. BAY YOU KNOW AS I TRIED TO A LITTLE TOO EVEN WITH THAT A DAY FUNDS MODEL SORT OF THIS IS ALL CONNECTED TO. FROM A BROADER SYSTEM DAY YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF REDUCTION SORT OF THE SAME. J. TWO IS HELPFUL. NO DOUBT- BUT- ALL THE SIGNS OF FEES BECOME ALBATROSSES ON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WHO AGAIN ARE THE ONES OVER REPRESENTING ALL OF THE SYSTEM.

TO AND THIS IS ABOUT THE SPRING CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS FOR THE CDC ARE AND- WHO IS HERE FROM CDC OURS THAT MR LEAVE. I GUESS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRIS LEAVES ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CDCR AS DISABILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT DIVISION- THIS ITEM CONCERNS- THREE TOP OUT LIKE PROPOSALS- THAT WERE SUBMITTED AS PART OF THIS SPRING FINANCED LETTER PROCESS. AT THE FIRST PROPOSAL IS AN INCREASE OF POLICE REVENUE AUTHORITY FOR FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND- FORWARD THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM- PROJECTS. AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA THERE ARE- PROJECTS REMAINING AT SIXTEEN OF THE TWENTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE FUNDED FROM THIS SOURCE. AND OF THE- OF THE- SIXTEEN INSTITUTIONS- THAT HAVE WORK REMAINING- THIS FUNDING WILL- PROVIDE- IT'S JUST A FUNDING FOR TO COMPLETE PROJECTS AT ELEVEN OF THE INSTITUTIONS- THE OTHER FIVE ARE EXPECTED TO- COMPLETE WITHIN THEIR EXISTING AUTHORITY- THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR THE PRELIMINARY PLANS PAYS. FOR PROJECTS TO- PRETTY. TO CONSTRUCT TWO NEW GROUNDWATER SUPPLY WELLS- TO PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE WATER SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE WATER AT CHUCKWALLA PAPERS AND IRONWOOD STATE PRISON- THE INSTITUTION'S ORIGINALLY HAD SIX WELLS THE- SERVER THE TWO INSTITUTIONS- BECAUSE OF MAINTENANCE ISSUES TO OF THE WELLS HAVE BEEN AT THE COMMISSION- THERE ARE TWO THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFFLINE THAT WE'RE AT IT'S TEMPTING TO GET REPAIRED. AND THERE ARE TWO THAT ARE OPERATING- THAT DON'T QUITE MEET. ATHLETES IS FOR X. MEN THAT THE INSTITUTIONS- SO THIS PROJECT IS NECESSARY TO- PROVIDE- AND IN ADDITIONAL TO WELLS- THAT WE CAN HAVE A RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY FOR. THE AT THE BILL DAYS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL CORPORATION FOR ELEVEN MILLION FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND A POLICE REVENUE AUTHORITY. FOR THE- IT'S TRACK PROJECTS THAT ARE IN ONE STATE PRISON- THIS SUPPLEMENTAL PREPARATION IS NECESSARY- FOR THE- TWO FUNDS EIGHT. INCREASED COSTS THAT ARE RELATED TO EXTEND I'M ONE OF THE PROJECT- WHICH WERE CAUSED BY- SOME DESIGNERS EMISSIONS- AND THEN- DURING COPAYS WE HAD- I THINK YOU WERE HOUSING UNITS AVAILABLE AT ANY GIVEN TIME- SO THAT SLOW PROJECTS OF PROGRESS AND- BAND THERE IS SOME UNFORESEEN FIELD CONDITIONS THAT ALSO EXTENDED THE PROJECT TIMELINE- BUT WITHOUT OVER BEYOND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- BELIAU ARE MISTER PUSH MORAL. THANK YOU LOOK KISHA MORROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE DON'T HAVE A CONCERN WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ON THAT HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS BONTA FIRST ARRIVAL MORE BACKGROUND THE FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS THE FIRST APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE- AND THE PRODUCTS ARE INTENDED TO RENOVATE EXPAND TREATMENT SPACES TO IMPROVE MEDICAL CARE IN. PRISON FACILITIES. THE WAY THE PROJECT WAS STRUCTURED IN THIS FUNDING WAS FIRST APPROVED LIST ALL THE PROJECT AT ALL THE PRISONS FOR THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS LIKE THAT- ARE CONSIDERED ONE PROJECT FOR THE PURPOSE OF BUDGIE BUDGETING. THERE'S A LOT OF ADMINISTRATION TO MOVE MONEY BETWEEN THE PROJECTS AND ALSO ALLOWS LIMITATION TO AUGMENT THE TOTAL AMOUNT BY TWENTY PERCENT. WITH FIRE INVOCATION TO THAT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE- SENSING. FOR THE FUNDING FOR THIS THE FIRST PROVE THAT THE NUMBER OF CHANGES NECESSARY TO BRING THE PROJECTS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIRE LIFE AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. AND TO ADDRESS THESE COST INCREASES THE LEGISLATURE HAS IMPROVED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION IN ADDITIONAL. LEASE REVENUE FOR THESE PROJECTS. ALL GIVE ABILITY TO AUGMENT AMOUNT BY TWENTY PERCENT- BADLY USED EIGHTEEN POINT 5% OF THE TWENTY PERCENT. OFF AUTHORITY OR TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS PROPOSAL- WHAT ALLOW THE MINISTRATION TO. RECEIVE ADDITIONAL ALL THESE REVENUE AUTHORITY AND IS BECAUSE THE PROP DEPARTMENT CONGRESS JACKS. THAT ARE FOR THE RATE INCREASES FOR COST OF THE LEVEL OF THE TICKET PROJECTS THAT WOULD CAUSE IT TO EXCEED THE FIFTEEN POINT ONE MILLION THAT COULD BE REMAINS BELOW ITS 20% POLITICIAN WOMEN. ENTER THE REQUESTING FORTY POINT TWO MILLION ADDITIONAL LEASE REVENUE AUTHORITY. BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT I KNOW THE 20% THIS COULD RESULT IN A TOTAL OF FIFTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION. DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY FOR THESE PROJECTS. WE FIND THAT WHILE IT IS GENERALLY APPROPRIATE TO INCREASE OF THE TRAVELER OF THE WORLD FOR THESE PROJECTS. IT WOULD NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE RIDE ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION. ORTEGA PROJECT PRISON THAT'LL BE CLOSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. FOUNDED THE DECLINING PRISON POPULATIONS STUDENTS ARE ALREADY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CLOSE TO PRISONS BY TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THE STATE WILL BE IN A POSITION BECAUSE ANOTHER THREE PRISONS BY. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE. IT BASED ON CARNEY REVIEW WE BUT IN A NUMBER OF PRISONS ARE STRONG. FOR CLOSURE LARGELY DUE TO HIGHEST OF COSTS OPERATE COSTS FOR. RELATIVE TO THE CAPACITY WITHIN THOSE PRISONS. IT DIFFICULT TO ONCE AGAIN IF I THE- READABILITY CENTER NORCO. INCLUDING STATE. CORRECTIONAL TWENTY TO IN SEOUL. AND CALIFORNIA MAY COLONY SEEMS CDNS OBISPO. AND DESPITE CMC STRONGER FORECLOSURE. IT EASIER HAS THAT GOING TO MILLION AND PROPOSAL WOULD BE UTILIZED FOR A PROJECT AT YOU SEE. THIS IS A THAT SIMPLY POTENTIALLY CLOSE WE OR SHORTLY THE PROJECT IS COMPLETE. WE RECOMMEND NOT THE- PROPOSED TO ENSURE THAT FUNNY IS NOT ON. ON CHRIS ARE SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THIS IS A GREAT RESOURCE FOR DIRECT THE NEWS OF TO LIVE OF REASONS ARE STRONG FOR. SECOND ALLEGED COMMAND USERS IN TO IF IT AGREES WITH ASSESSMENT OFF FIND THAT OTHER PERSON TO BE STRONG CANDIDATES. TOWARD THE LESSER COULD APPROVE BY THE TRAILER STATE TO FOR ME FROM USING A THE REVENUE FOR THE PROJECT AT PRISONS THE VIEWS A STRONG CANDIDATES FOR. FOURTH THE MINISTRATION COULD ADJUST THE INCREASINGLY REGULATORY ACCORDINGLY SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE LEGISLATURE AGREES THAT SEEMS EVEN STRONGER CANADA CLOSER THEY COULD REDUCE THE PROPOSAL IS REVENUE THIRTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION WHICH IS THAT NOT A LETTER INDICATES THAT TIME ADMINISTRATION. WE RECOMMEND CORRECTING THE MINISTRATION TO NOT USE ITS ABILITY TO AUGMENT THE LEGISLATIVELY QUIGLEY'S REGULATORY PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PROJECTS PRISONS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS FROM CAN ITS CLOSURE. YEAH THE LEGISLATURE ASSESSMENT THE COULD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FINANCE- YOU'D LIKE TO COMMENT. BRING ON RUNNING HER SUPPORT IN A FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FURTHER TO ADD. OKAY COLLEAGUES MAY I RESPOND TO THE L. L. CUMMINS. WOOD COUNTY- CHRIS OKAY YES GO AHEAD MR LEAF. THANK YOU- SO- IT WILL BE UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATURE IS CONCERNED IN LA IS CONCERNED ABOUT- THE SPENDING MONEY ON IT ABSOLUTELY IS THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE CLOSED- I WOULD I WOULD POINT OUT TWO THINGS- ONE EIGHT IN GENERAL THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS FOR ACTIVE PROJECTS NOT TO START NEW PROJECTS. AND TO- FOR AS CMC IN PARTICULAR- ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROPOSED ANY ADDITIONAL PRISONS FOR CLOSURE BEYOND- TPI AND CCC- C. R. A C. M. C. HAS A MENTAL HEALTH- COMMISSION. THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO THE DEPARTMENT AND WHICH CONTINUES TO BE OF CONCERN TO THE COMMON COURT FOR HAVING A CAPACITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH. PROGRAMS WHICH WOULD- ARGUE IN FAVOR OF ITS CONTINUED OPERATION THANK. THANK YOU- EITHER TO THE CDC OR OR- BELIAU CAN YOU GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON THE INITIAL LEASE REVENUE BOND APPROPRIATION AND THE OF INCREASES IN AUGMENTATION UP AUGMENTATION AUTHORITY. AND DO YOU ANTICIPATE INCREASES IN THE FORTY FOR THE FUTURE YEARS. D. THE REQUEST TO THE FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS I REQUEST BEFORE YOU NOW REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM- WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO COME BACK OR ADDITIONAL FUNDING- BUT THAT WILL BE EVALUATED AGAIN AS OF THE PROJECT- CONTINUE. OKAY THE L. A. O. HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. NO FURTHER COMMENTS ELIZABETH OKAY. OKAY- IF THERE NO FURTHER- QUESTIONS FOR MARK MY COLLEAGUES THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD OPEN THESE PROPOSALS THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. ARE WE MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE THREE. OF AND THAT IS THE STATE A REMOTE COMMUNICATIONS AT CDC OUR ADULT PRISONS. I BELIEVE. KRISTIN MONTGOMERY. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KRISTA MONTGOMERY AND I AM THE ACTING DIRECTOR FOR ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SERVICES AT CDC ARE. IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY CDC ARE TEMPORARILY STOPPED IN PERSON VISITING TO CURTAIL THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN VIRUS IN PRISONS. CDCR DISCUSSED AVENUES TO BEGIN REUNIFICATION PROCESS DURING THE PANDEMIC. CDCR INITIATE INITIATED BDO VISITATION IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY IS A VEHICLE CONNECT CONNECT FAMILY AND FRIENDS. AS PART OF CCAR'S CONTINUED EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN THE FAMILY CONNECTIONS GTL PROVIDED FREE PHONE CALLING DAYS FOR ONE YEAR. STARTED IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND ENDED IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY SIX RECALLING DAYS. IN THE WINTER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE BEGAN THE PILOT AT THE FIVE SITES LISTED IN THE AGENDA TO ALLOW US TO OPERATIONALIZE THE USE OF TABLETS IN THE HE ASKED TO PROVIDE EXPANDED COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY. INCLUDING SECURE ELECTRONIC MESSAGING IN BONN VIDEO CLIPS AND PHOTOS. IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY CITIES HERE OUR WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THERESA COMPETITIVE OPEN SOLICITATION FOR NEW SERVICES TO CONSOLIDATE ALL COMMUNICATIONS. LEVERAGE A REDUCTION IN COMMUNICATION RATES. THE NEW CONTRACT WAS AWARDED TO GTL PROVIDES GREATLY REDUCED RATES WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT ON MARCH NINETEENTH. THIS IS A SIX YEAR CONTRACT WITH FOUR ONE YEAR OPTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE REDUCED RATE OF TELEPHONE CALLS THE CONTRACTS THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT ON THE PATH TO ENHANCE COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY ACROSS THE STATE. INCLUDING EXPANDING ACCESS TO TABLETS AND KIOSKS. EVERY INCARCERATED PERSON RECEIVES FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FREE TELEPHONE CALLS EVERY TWO WEEKS FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE CONTRACT AND ALL USE CALLS REMAIN FREE OF CHARGE. THE CONTRACT WITH THE PREVIOUS MULTI TIERED CALLING RATE WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY SEVEN POINT SIX CENTS. PER IN STATE AND TWENTY ONE CENTS FOR OUT OF STATE. TO NATIONWIDE RATE OF TWO POINT FIVE CENTS PER MINUTE. THIS CONTRACT ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES LIKE SENDING AND RECEIVING SECURE MESSAGES.

THE CAR'S RATED INDIVIDUALS WERE IN GINGIN GINGIN WILL RECEIVE FIVE FREE MESSAGE CREDITS PER WEEK. THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON TABLETS THAT ARE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO THE INCARCERATED I DON'T KIOSKS INSTALLED IN THE HOUSING UNITS. WE ARE TURNING HOW TO KIOSKS AND TABLETS IMPLEMENT AT THE ADULT INSTITUTIONS BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. WITH VALLEY STATE PRISON BEING OUR FIRST SITE. WHICH IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR MID JUNE. STATEWIDE WE HAVE PRIORITIZED YOUTHFUL OFFENDER REHABILITATION COMMUNITIES. AND PROGRESSIVE PROGRAMMING FACILITIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE. VIDEO CALLS WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE ON THE NEW SOLUTION INCARCERATED INCARCERATED PEOPLE WILL RECEIVE FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FREE VIDEO CALLS IN ADDITION TO FREE PHONE CALLING EVERY TWO WEEKS FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE CONTRACT. ADDITIONAL VIDEO CALLS WILL BE TOOK CHARGE AT A RATE OF TWENTY CENTS PER MINUTE. ON APRIL TENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IN PERSON VISITING BEGAN AGAIN WITH A LIMIT OF ONE VISIT PER MONTH. FOR ONE HOUR. BASED ON THE DEPARTMENTS RE OPENING ROAD MAP CDCR IS NOT IMPLEMENTING AN EXTENSION TO OUR VISITS. FOR TWO ADDITIONAL VISITORS BEGINNING ON MAY FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. IF CONDITIONS WARRANT CDCR IS PROPOSING TO REINSTITUTE FAMILY VISITING ON JUNE SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR. NOW LET ME DESCRIBE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS OR SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE PANEL MAY BE INTERESTED IN. BARELY A PRINCE MISSTEPS A PREPAID ACCOUNT WITH GTL TO ALLOW THEIR INCARCERATED FAMILY MEMBER TO CALL THEM. WE ELIMINATED THE CALL SET UP FEE FOR OUR NEW CONTRACT TO MAKE THE PROCESS EASIER. IN ADDITION WE REMOVED THE PREVIOUS MULTI TIER CALLING RIGHT TO A NATION WIDE RATE OF TWO POINT FIVE CENTS PER MINUTE. THE CONTRACT WITH GTL WENT THROUGH A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION CONDUCTED BY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES. THE RESPONSES REVALUATION SCORED BASED ON THE SERVICES AND RATES OFFERED BY THE BIDDERS. GTO WAS AWARDED THE CONTRACT. THE AGENDA IDENTIFIED PASSED LEGISLATION IN COMMUNICATIONS RELATED TO PHONE COSTS FOR ADULTS AND JUVENILES OVER THE YEARS. OVER THE PAST DECADE CDCR HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED COST OF CALLING FROM STATE PRISONS AS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHART BUDGET IN THE AGENDA. IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE CONTRACT WAS AMENDED TO ELIMINATE CONCESSION FEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SENATE BILL EIGHTY ONE. THE UNDER PER YEARLY REVENUE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT WAS REDUCED. AS PART OF THE CONTRACT GTL PROVIDES MONTHLY AND ANNUAL PERSONAL C. T. AND C. D. C. R. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THERE WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION MINUTES OF CALLING. THE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS SPENT ABOUT TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLIONS ON PHONE CALLS. WITH THE NEW RATES THAT SAME CALL LINE BECAUSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS ABOUT EIGHT MILLION. WE BELIEVE THE REDUCTION RATE AS WELL AS PROVIDING FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FREE CALLING EVERY TWO WEEKS WILL FURTHER INCREASE THE CALL VOLUME ALLOWING EVEN MORE COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILIES AND FRIENDS. ARE YOU HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EMORY WE GOT NOW I'D LIKE TO HAVE- EXCUSE MY LACK OF PRONUNCIATION DANYCH A ROTOR MURDER MILE. STATE POLICY DIRECTOR THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER TO DISCUSS THE IMPACTS ON INCARCERATED FAMILIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT I REALLY MESS UP YOUR NAME. DANNECKER O'DONNELL NAY DID PRETTY WELL ROAD I'M SORRY SAY IT AGAIN RO DARNELL ROAD GOVERNMENTAL OKAY. IT GOOD NEWS THANK YOU. I GET AFTERNOON AND DANNECKER- DARNELL STATE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER AND I WANT TO START BY THANKING STAFF FOR THEIR GREAT WORK ON THE SIDE- AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE SPEAKING WITH YOU ABOUT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THIS IS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DIRECTLY IMPACTED CALIFORNIANS. I ALSO HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE SOMETIMES PAYING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A MONTH TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH AN INCARCERATED LOVED ONE. ACCESS BETWEEN INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS IS TRULY A LIFELINE. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE WILL FORGO PAYING BILLS SOMETIMES HAVING UTILITIES TURNED OFF. AND OFTEN GOING INTO DEBT IN ORDER TO DO SO. MANY PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED TO LEARN THAT THE MAJORITY OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE HAVE EFFECTIVELY NO ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE. WHAT ACCESS THEY MAY HAVE IS OFTEN LOW QUALITY AND REQUESTING MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT WHILE INCARCERATED ISN'T JUST STIGMATIZED FOR MANY IT CAN BE USED AGAINST THEM IN THEIR EFFORTS TO GAIN THEIR FREEDOM. THEREFORE OFTEN INCARCERATED PEOPLE'S ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT IS THROUGH THEIR CONNECTION TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS. IT IS ALSO CRUCIAL TO THE WELL EING OF FAMILIES WITH INCARCERATED MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEM. AS FAMILY SEPARATION LEADS TO WORSE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN WITH INCARCERATED PARENTS ANXIETY ABOUT THE SAFETY OF A LOVED ONE IN JAIL PRISON OR IMMIGRATION DETENTION CAN OFTEN ONLY BE ALLEVIATED IN THE MOMENTS OF HEARING THEIR VOICE ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE. AND FINALLY A FAMILY CONNECTION LONG CARS READ HAS BEEN PROVEN TO INCREASE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY OUTCOMES. WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE NEARLY EVERYONE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN THE STATE WILL BE RELEASED AT SOME POINT. THE NEED FOR ACCESSIBLE REMOTE COMMUNICATION HAS ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC WHEN SUDDENLY ALL ACCESS TO IN PERSON VISITS WERE CUT OFF AND EXPENSIVE AND HIGH DEMAND PHONE CALLS BECAME THE ONLY WAY TO HEAR A LOVED ONE'S VOICE. SO LET'S BE CLEAR THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. ACCESS BETWEEN INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ON THE OUTSIDE SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A PUBLIC UTILITY AND IT IS WORTHY OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT. LOVED ONES ON THE OUTSIDE PAY THE COST OF KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH INCARCERATED PEOPLE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY NOT INCARCERATED PEOPLE THEMSELVES. THIS IS TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN WE EXAMINE WHO FOOTS THE BILL FOR MOST OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM CONTACT. AND WITHOUT EXCEPTION THESE COSTS FALL MOST HEAVILY UPON WOMEN OF COLOR. WELL I APPLAUD GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE IN CDC ARE FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS AREA THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE TO DO. THE ISSUE REMAINS ENTIRELY UNADDRESSED IN OUR JAILS WHERE THE SITUATION IS MUCH WORSE WITH RATES AS HIGH AS SEVENTEEN DOLLARS FOR A FIFTEEN MINUTE CALL IN ONE COUNTY. CURRENTLY PRIVATE TELECOM COMPANIES CONTROL THE MARKET AND THE SYSTEM IS SET UP TO EXTRACT EXTRACT AS MUCH MONEY FROM CONSUMERS AS POSSIBLE. BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS LEVERAGE TO NEGOTIATE DIFFERENT CONTRACTS AND PRICING STRUCTURES TO GET A MUCH BETTER DEAL. THAN INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS CAN. FOR EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO RECENTLY BROKE THE INDUSTRY MOLD BY CONTRACTING A FIXED RATE RATHER THAN PERMANENT CONTRACT MAKING IT INCREDIBLY AFFORDABLE FOR THE COVERS CITY TO COVER THE COST OF PHONE CALLS IN OUR JAILS. AND MAKING UP SO LITTLE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BUDGET THAT IT HAS BEEN DEEMED TO BUDGET DUST. DURING THE PANDEMIC CDCR DID BEGIN PROVIDING FREE VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS WHICH IS OPENED UP THE ABILITY FOR SOME FAMILIES TO SEE EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS. THESE SERVICES SHOULD CONTINUE BEYOND THE PANDEMIC WITH THE COPIER THAT THEY SHOULD BE OFFERED IN ADDITION TO AND NEVER IN REPLACEMENT OF IN PERSON VISITS. NOTHING AS A REPLACEMENT FOR IN PERSON CONTACT. THEREFORE I RECOMMEND THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING. FIRST PROVIDE FREE PHONE CALLS TO PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN OUR STATE PRISONS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR AND USE THIS PERIOD TO EXPLORE MAKING PHONE CALLS FREE PERMANENTLY. IT SHOULD INCLUDE REIMAGINING STATE CONTRACTS AND SHIFTING TOWARDS FIXED RATE AGREEMENTS. SECOND ENSURE FREE VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS REMAIN AVAILABLE AT ALL OF THE STATE RUN INSTITUTIONS. THIRD ENSURE THAT ASKED TABLETS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY ARE INTRODUCED TO PRESENTS THAT ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES REMAIN AFFORDABLE OVERALL. THESE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE CONSUMERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM PREDATORY INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES LIKE EMAIL AND ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL SHOULD BE EXTREMELY LOW COST AND FREE WHEREVER POSSIBLE. FINALLY WE MIGHT NEXT TURN OUR ATTENTION TO ENSURING THAT COMMUNICATIONS FOR PEOPLE IN JAILS IN THE STATE ARE MADE AFFORDABLE. WHEN AND BY SAYING THAT TRUE ACCESSIBILITY BETWEEN INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS REQUIRES ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS REASONABLE ACCESS. OUR PRISON SYSTEM IS NOT A HOMOGENOUS POPULATION AND MANY PEOPLE CURRENTLY LACK ACCESS DUE TO UNAFFORDABILITY AND INACCESSIBILITY THEREFORE WE MUST PROVIDE A RANGE OF OPTIONS IN FREE PHONE CALLS AND VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS REPRESENTS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE WAS A VERY VERY HELPFUL- I THINK. COLLEAGUES YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YES GO AHEAD SENATE- MERGER ONE ONE VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION- AND IT WAS- I FORGET WHO BROUGHT IT UP BUT THERE IS I THINK IN THE OPENING PRESENTATION THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO. OF THE FIVE CREDITS FOR. INDIGENT INMATES IN IT'S SORT OF A QUESTION JUST. OF FOR MY FUTURE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THINGS ARE TO FIND IN THE SYSTEM HOW DO YOU SEPARATE OUT WHO'S AN INDIGENT INMATE FROM WHO ISN'T- IT STRIKES ME. THAT THIS IS FAIRLY EASY TO DO THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT- AND I MEAN THE GENERAL NON INCARCERATED POPULATION BUT- IT SEEMS LIKE MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. IN THE PRISON SYSTEM WOULD BY. BY DEFINITION BE- YOU KNOW AT LEAST ON THEIR OWN AS ADULT HUMAN BEINGS I'M NOT I'M NOT COUNTING. ANY GRATUITOUS FAMILY ASSISTANCE WE GET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT ON THEIR OWN IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THEY'RE- THEY'RE IN A PRETTY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THERE IN TERMS OF POVERTY SO- COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT IT AGAIN IT'S A QUESTION OF CURIOSITY AS MUCH AS ANYTHING. IS CHRIS MUNGER MEGAN- I HAVE TO GET BACK ON THE DEFINITION OF WHAT THERE IS DEFINITIONS WITH REGARDS TO THAT I'LL HAVE TO GET THAT. INFORMATION BACK TO YOU. YEAH I GUESS I GUESS I DID HAVE A VALUE JUDGMENT ON IT WOULD BE IF THAT'S A VERY MARGINAL. DIFFERENCE THEN MAYBE IT SHOULD JUST BE ERASED AT SOME POINT- AS AND EVERYBODY GETS THE CREDIT- IN A BAR IN SOME OTHER CRITERIA OTHER THAN. POVERTY I GUESS IS A HOTEL IF YOU THE WORD INDIGENT BUT- IF THERE'S IF THERE'S OTHER REASONS FOR BEHAVIOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE COME INTO PLAY THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MANAGER THEY GIVE. UP JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS WHAT DO YOU GET THE CREDITS FOR. D. THE CREDITS FOR THE MESSAGING. SO IT'S THE EMAIL MESSAGING. BUT HOW DOES SOMEONE GET CREDITS FOR THAT IF YOU COULD JUST EXPLAIN THAT CONNECTION YES THANK YOU SO IT WAS AMAZING HEY WE ARE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR VENDOR AND BEAT AND WE PUT TO THEIR ACCOUNT SO IT'S A TIED DIRECTLY TO THEIR ACCOUNT WHEN- PAYMENTS COME IN. THEY GET A CREDIT ON THEIR ACCOUNT. OKAY SO THIS IS. THIS IS PAID FOR BY. EMILY SOMEONE WHO SENDS IN RIGHT RIGHT SO- WHEN FRIENDS AND FAMILIES PAID FOR- PHONE CALLS AND THAT THAT TYPE OF THING GOES INTO THE COUNT FOR THE INMATE AND IF THERE'S CREDITS IT ACTUALLY WILL BE CREDITED ON THE INMATE'S ACCOUNT SO THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WILL SEE THAT THERE'S A CREDIT. OKAY. THAT MAKES SENSE. FOR ME THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE FOR YOUR FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR ME IT'S ENOUGH INFORMATION UNTIL WE GET- SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME SOME WRITTEN INFORMATION LATER. THANK YOU FOR. ADD ONE THING YES I WAS INTO SEE IN THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM AND THAT IS DETERMINED BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON SOMEBODY'S BOOKS THEY CALL IT THEIR ACCOUNT WHICH IS PUT THERE BY FAMILY MEMBERS GENERALLY- PEOPLE DO GET PAID SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY IF THEY'RE WORKING IN THE PRISONS BUT GENERALLY THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON THEIR ACCOUNTS ARE PUT THERE BY FAMILY MEMBERS. OKAY YEAH RIGHT NOW I'M SURE PHONY FOUR FIVE EIGHT I JUST THINK. IT MIGHT BE OUTSIDE OF FROM AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE- IS THE IDEA THAT. ONE INMATE HAS FAMILY THAT'S GENEROUS AND PUTTING MONEY UP FOR THEM AND ANOTHER INMATE DOESN'T- MAYBE JUST NEEDS TO BE DISREGARDED IN THIS CONTEXT IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS CAUSES I MEAN THE IDEA WOULD BE. ALLOWING COMMUNICATIONS TO OCCUR. I WOULD THINK FAIRLY- EQUITABLY ACROSS THE SYSTEM IRRESPECTIVE OF. WHO HAS A RICH UNCLE OR NOT FROM THIS THAT'S OR FOR HOW LONG THAT MAY BE THE CASE- BUT ANYWAY THAT'S JUST MY- PERSONAL OPINION NO I AGREE ESPECIALLY- AS WE HEAR ABOUT HOW THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH THIS HAS AN IMPACT WITH REENTRY SUCCESS MEAN ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE SORT OF LOOKING FOR- YOU KNOW TO CHANGE IN THE IN THE SYSTEM. THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T THINK OF PHONE CALLS AND VIDEOS IN CONNECTION WITH FAMILY OF WOULD BE SO IMPORTANT TO THE TO THE FUTURE OF THOSE- INDIVIDUALS AND NEWMAN THEY JUST ADD IMAGE OF MY UNDERSTAND IS MOST OF THE SYSTEMS ARE. VESTIGES FROM THE OPEN YOU KNOW WHAT TIME BEFORE BROADBAND WAS UBIQUITOUS. AND SO IN THE CURRENT YEAR RIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE. TO IT INTERSERVE. IT UP BASS PROPOSED WHERE GET RID GETS. AND THERE'S NO EFFECTIVE COST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY THERE MAYBE YOU'D PAY EXTRA FOR ADDITIONAL ACCESS BUT- IT SEEMS. YOU KNOW SORT OF UNREASONABLE AND BORDERLINE CRUEL TO DENY. PRISONERS ACCESS TO THEIR FAMILIES DECEMBER BECAUSE IS A VENDOR SYSTEM IN PLACE YEAH THAT. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL- THEY'RE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE OUT YOU JUST ONE MORE QUESTION FOR- LET'S SEE WHAT WHAT WE X. EXPECT THE TIMELINE FOR THE RESUMPTION OF IN PERSON VISITATION TO BE. THE TIMELINE FOR IN PERSON WE ARE AS ARE- AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT- ROADMAP TO RE OPENING. AND WE'VE ALREADY STARTED SOME OF THE IN PERSON VISITING- AT ALL ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND IN IN THAT STARTED ON APRIL TENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. AND THEN- BY MAY FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE- WE'RE GONNA BE IMPLEMENTING EXTENSION OF TO OUR VISITS. FOR JUDICIAL VISITORS. AND THEN THE WE HOPE BY- JUNE- BY JUNE SEVENTH WILL BE ABLE TO REINSTATE FAMILY BUSINESS. SO YEAH THAT'S NICE OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I AGREE WITH YEAH I AGREE WITH THE ISSUE THAT- THE VIDEO- CONNECTION SHOULD NOT REPLACE THE IN PERSON- CONTACT THAT- THESE INDIVIDUALS COULD HAVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES THANK YOU JUST A QUICK DAY MAY FIFTEENTH IS THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW SORT OF A ON TRACK TO. HIT THE DILLON. YES WE ARE IN GOOD GOOD TO HEAR YEAH GREAT OKAY WELL WE THANK BOTH OF YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH US AND- PROVIDE ALL THIS INFORMATION PRECIADO THANK YOU. BOTH OF THIS- IS INFORMATIONAL SIR MOVING ON TO ISSUE FOR- WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IMPROVING THE PAROLE PREPARATION PROCESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE- JAMES KING CAMPAIGN MANAGER AT THE ELLA BAKER CENTER. TO TESTIFY AND PROVIDE HIS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU FOR BEING GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON HERE AND EACH MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS JAMES KING AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER AT THE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. THEY'RE LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A MODEST REFORM THAT CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE AN OUTSIZED IMPACT UPON PAROLE SUITABILITY RATES. FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE WERE GOING TO THEIR INITIAL PAROLE BOARD HEARINGS. ADDING ONE ADDITIONAL HOUR OF A TURN TIME FOR A TOTAL OF TWO HOURS WITHIN THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS OF THEIR- FIRST GADGIL PAROLE BOARD HEARING WILL HELP PEOPLE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN TO THE PRO PROCESS. WITH PREPARATION AND IMPROVING GRANT RATES. I WAS PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND IN JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN I WAS INFORMED THAT I WILL GO BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD HEARING. TO DETERMINE MY SUITABILITY FOR RELEASE THAT APPROACHING AUGUST. A FEW WEEKS LATER I RECEIVED A VISIT FROM A STATE APPOINTED ATTORNEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY WOULD REPRESENT ME DURING MY HEARING. AT THE TIME THE ATTORNEY WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH MY CONVICTION HISTORY. THE REASON I WAS IN PRISON OR ANYTHING I'D DONE WHILE IN PRISON. I WANTED ADVICE ABOUT MY ODDS OF SUCCESS ATTENTION HURDLES TO BEING FOUND SUITABLE AND THINGS I COULD BETTER WORK ON TO PREPARE MYSELF. INSTEAD WE USED OUR FIRST MEETING FOR ME TO TELL HER ABOUT MYSELF IN FOR HER TO GIVE ME A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE PAROLE PROCESS. ABOUT A MONTH LATER I RECEIVED AN APPOINTMENT FOR A COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT OR CRA. CRA IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST TO DETERMINE AN INDIVIDUAL'S RISK FOR FUTURE VIOLENCE OF RECIDIVISM. DURING THE ASSESSMENT I WAS ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD CRIMINAL HISTORY INSIGHT INTO WHY I COMMITTED MY COMMITMENT OFFENSE WE ABILITY OF WORK I'VE DONE SINCE COMING TO PRISON AS WELL AS DISCIPLINARY HISTORY AND POST RELEASE PLANS. I'D LATER FIND OUT THAT THESE WERE ALL TOPICS THAT WILL BE COVERED IN EVEN MORE DEPTH THAT MY PAROLE HEARING. AND THE ANSWERS ARE GIVEN TO THE FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGISTS WERE INTEGRAL PART OF THE PREPARATION OF PAROLE COMMISSIONERS WERE GOING TO ASSESS MY SUITABILITY FOR RELEASE. I'VE BEEN DILIGENTLY DOING MY OWN REHABILITATIVE WORK FOR FIFTEEN YEARS LEADING UP TO THIS FINAL SIX MONTHS. BUT WHILE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS I LEARNED THAT THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERNALIZING THE SKILLS I NEED TO SAFELY REENTER SOCIETY. AND EXPRESSING THAT INSIGHT REMORSE IN PREPARATION TO OTHERS. MY LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PROCESS AND WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME LARGELY LEFT ME AT RISK OF FAILING TO BE FOUND SUITABLE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN WORKING TO REHABILITATE MYSELF FOR OVER A DECADE AND A HALF. SO WHEN I SAW EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY. ONLY ELEVEN POINT 5% OF PEOPLE WERE FOUND SUITABLE FOR RELEASE AT THEIR INITIAL HEARING. I WASN'T SURPRISED. IN FAR TOO MANY CASES THE BARRIER TO BEING FOUND SUITABLE ISN'T THE WORK A PERSON IS DONE. INSTEAD IT'S A LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE PROCESS AND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM. PRIOR TO EACH PERSON'S RELEASE THROUGH THE PAROLE BOARD PROCESS. PEOPLE GO TO AN EXHAUSTIVE AND RIGOROUS EXAMINATION THAT CULMINATES IN A PAROLE BOARD HEARING. THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING AN ATTORNEY'S GUIDANCE THROUGH EVERY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. GRANTING INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARING FOR THEIR FIRST PAROLE BOARD HEARING AN ADDITIONAL HOUR PREP TIME WITH AN ATTORNEY. IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF THE C. R. A. TOPICS THE SEAT THE FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST WILL INTERROGATE. DISCUSS ANY POTENTIAL LEGAL LIABILITIES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PROVIDE TIME FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WILL IMPROVE THE ODDS OF SUCCESS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THE WORK LACK KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROCESS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR ALONE I'VE SPOKEN TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE OF GOING TO THE PAROLE BOARD PROCESS. IN EACH HAS SUPPORTED THIS ADDITIONAL OUR AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT PEOPLE. A FEW LIKE ME WERE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT IT BUT THE VAST MAJORITY EXPERIENCE A LARGELY UNNECESSARY SET BACK THAT THIS RECALL REFORM WOULD HELP FIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER KING- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY AND SHARING THAT WITH US- YOUR EXPERIENCES UP MATTER IN A VERY VERY BIG WAY AND- OBVIOUSLY HAVE A BIG IMPACT. SO THANK YOU AGAIN- COLLEAGUES IN THE- MISTER NEWMAN YOUR AVAILABLE ACCOUNT OR NEW. EITHER ONE'S FINE MISTER KING THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AND I'M ALWAYS IMPRESSED WHEN A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL CAN- OF- ON THEIR OWN THE OBSERVE AFFECT PROGRESS OR CERTAINLY INSTIGATE A GOOD CONVERSATION LIKE THIS RIGHT SO I COMMEND YOU- THE LAWYERS PROVIDED FOR YOU I ASSUME ARE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND PAID FOR BY. SOME JURISDICTION RIGHT. YES THEY'RE THEY'RE PAID THAT THE FUNDING GOES THROUGH CDC ARTS OF THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS WHICH THEN ALLOCATES A STATE APPOINTED PUBLIC OF THE- PAROLE BOARD HERE ATTORNEYS. NO I WON'T HOLD YOU TO IT BUT WHEN WE SAY ADDITIONAL TIME WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE INCREMENTAL ADDITIONAL TIME DO YOU THINK AS A STANDARD. THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE PROGRESS. RIGHT NOW STATE APPOINTED PAROLE BOARD ATTORNEYS MEET WITH A AN INDIVIDUAL SCHEDULED FOR THEIR FIRST HEARING FOR ONE HOUR WITHIN THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS. WE THINK AN ADDITIONAL HOUR STRICTLY FOR PREPARATION FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT. WOULD HELP A LOT. AND HIS IS ANYBODY A SISTER BARB. TRIED DESPERATE THE COST OF THE DIVISIONAL OUR ACROSS THE SYSTEM. FROM EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE SEEN IT WOULD IT WOULD BE RELATIVELY MODEST FOR INSTANCE LAST YEAR THERE WERE. WELL AN ADDITIONAL HOUR FOR THE FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED. PEOPLE GOING FOR WILL BE OFFERED BY OUR WORD IS I'M SORRY MR KING WE LOST YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED YOU A BIT THERE SO IF CAN. GO BACK A FEW SITE WHEN HE WAS GETTING GOOD GRIEF CUT OUT. YES I WAS JUST SAYING THAT THAT- LAST YEAR THERE WERE FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY NINE PEOPLE WHO HAD AN INITIAL HEARING THAT WOULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM THIS THIS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE. THAT THEY CAN HAVE. A LARGE IMPACT TO EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND NATIONAL HOURS AT AN APPROXIMATE GROWTH. I WOULD SAY HE ROUGHLY AROUND A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR THAT MIGHT BE HIGH. MY POOR. SURE THAT DOESN'T DOES NOT SEEM SEEMS LIKE A GOOD INVESTMENT TO ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. FOR GREED BECAUSE THEY KNOW NOTHING TO SAY I AGREE WITH- SO SHE MIGHT COME AS WAS THERE NEWMAN OKAY- AND IF YOU COULD JUST SUM UP WHAT YOU THINK. OF THE OUTCOME WOULD BE. IF WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS AS YOU RECOMMEND. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN TO PEOPLE OR WHAT I WOULD DO MEASURE. THE OUTCOME IF WE PROVIDED THESE ADDITIONAL HOURS. I THINK THE. THE FOREIGN THE FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED IN EXETER PEOPLE WENT TO THE PAROLE BOARD LAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME- RIGHT ROUGHLY AROUND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE FOUND SUITABLE- THE GAP IS NOT THOUGH IN THE WORK OF PEOPLE ARE DOING TO PREPARE FOR THEIR RE ENTRY IT'S IN A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESS AND WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM SO HAVING ACCESS TO AN ATTORNEY IN ORDER TO WALK THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS ILLUMINATE THE- THE ON DIRECTOR SEES THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE. TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM I THINK WE HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON EVEN IF AN ADDITIONAL- FIFTY PEOPLE PER YEAR WERE FOUND SUITABLE AS A RESULT OF THIS. THAT WOULD SAVE THE STATE. OWNED I THINK EVERY PERSON RIGHT NOW COST THE STATE ROUGHLY AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO INCARCERATED. SO JUST FIFTY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT. YEAH UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES IT'S A SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THE DOLLARS- AND I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO. TO INCLUDE BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS- AS HUMAN BEANS. I AGREE IN THE END AND APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- YOU KNOW FOR ME WHEN I WAS GOING TO THE PAROLE BOARD PROCESS I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT- BUT OFTENTIMES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED FOR TWENTY FIVE PLUS YEARS. AND SO. GEN WHO ARE THERE TO HELP SUPPORT YOU AND PREPARE YOU FOR- FOR SAFE RE ENTRY INTO SOCIETY MEANS THE WORLD TO PEOPLE I KNOW IT IS WRONG TO ME I WAS TALKING IN THE LAST PANEL ABOUT- JUST A MENTAL HEALTH AND SO SEEN THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND KNOWING THAT THE STATE IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO DEMYSTIFY THE PROCESS AND HELP PEOPLE FEEL SUPPORTED IN A RE ENTRY. IT WOULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT. IF I COULD NOT YOURS WHY DO THE QUICK MATH BASED MR KING'S COMMENTS SO IF FIVE THOUSAND HOURS GIANT TIMES UNDERSERVED FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT WOULD BE PRICE EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF IT WOULD GET FIFTY PEOPLE BACK ON THE ROAD AND SAVE THE STATE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER EACH THAT'S FIVE MILLION DOLLARS EACH IN THAT SAVINGS OR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS- SO THAT'S PRETTY COMPELLING MATH. YES THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN. WELL MISTER KING AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOT ONLY FOR BEING WITH US AND SHARING WITH US TODAY BUT WERE POORLY ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO EVERY SINGLE DAY AT THE ELEVATOR CENTER APPRECIATE YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS WORTH. OKAY THAT WAS INFORMATIONAL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE. ISSUE FIVE IS ON THE STATE FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION OF MISS LEE WILL DISCUSS THE BURKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNDING- THEY GO TO CD EIGHT A. AS WELL AS DISCUSS THE RESULTS OF BY. LOCAL AUDIT OF THEN CAN SPENCE SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR AT NEXT GEN POLICY AND ASHLEY WERNER DIRECTING ATTORNEY AT LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE STAFF NOTES THAT THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WAS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING BUT FORMALLY DECLINED. DUE TO AN ONGOING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION WE WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY AND WE'LL START WITH MISLI. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I AM GOING TO SHARE THE SCREEN AGAIN WITH YOU- IS LET ME KNOW IF YOU DO NOT SEE A COUPLE OF HANNAH ON BEFORE YOU- BUT STILL WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF STATE FUNDING. TO CDA AS WELL AS TO SUMMARIZE AUDIT FINDINGS- THAT WAS COMPLETED RECENTLY AS OF DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY SO USING THIS CANNOT AS A GUIDE FOR COMMENTS. ON WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE ONLY A WEBSITE. THE TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT ON CDA IS A MEMBERSHIP DRIVEN ORGANIZATION NOT FOR PROFIT ENGAGES IN VARIOUS ACTIVITIES AND DOES RECEIVE FUNDING FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP DUES STATE AND FEDERAL FINES AND LITIGATION PERCY. THE KEY THING FOR IN THIS HAND OUT AND WE'RE GONNA. TALK ABOUT THIS ONE IS THAT SOME OF THESE FUNDS ARE RESTRICTED WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO USE FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. TURNING TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT. WELL FIRST PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF STATE FUNDING PROVIDED TO CDA IN RECENT YEARS. PRETTY BROAD DEFINITION OF STATE FUNDING THIS INCLUDES ANY MONIES FOR WHICH THERE IS AUTHORIZATION UNDER STATE LAW ON ANY GRANT FUNDS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN AVAILABLE WITHOUT THE STATE AS WELL AS ANY LITIGATION PROCEEDS- THAT COME FROM CASES THAT ARE RESOLVED BY STATE ENTITIES. AND SO INERT LOOK IN THIS AREA WE IDENTIFIED APPROXIMATELY SEVEN FUNDING STREAMS. THE FIRST IS THAT STATE LAW SPECIFIES OR PROVIDES THE CDA WITH- MONIES TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE TRAINING TO PROSECUTORS ARE BY MENTAL REGULATORS ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. CDA LAST RECEIVED AROUND FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. I CAN'T STATE LAW CREATES AN PROJECT BETWEEN CALLUM. AND CDA KNOWN AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUIT PROSECUTOR PROJECT WHICH IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE IN UNIFORM ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH DOES INCLUDE ASSISTANCE TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE PURSUING CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS AND SINCE CA LAST RECEIVED AROUND SIXTY THREE THOUSAND FOR THEIR COSTS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THIRD STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT LOCAL DRUG RELATED ASSET FORFEITURES GO TO A PRIVATE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION COMPOSED OF LOCAL PROSECUTORS WHICH IS TRADITIONALLY THE CDA- FOR STATEWIDE TRAINING ON ASK FORFEITURE. AND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA ON CA RECEIVED AROUND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM- THESE FUNDS. TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT THE FOURTH STREAM OF FUNDING IS RELATED TO THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY THEFT APPREHENSION AND PROSECUTION PROGRAM. STATE LAW PROVIDES AROUND A HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO THOUSAND IN A REALIGNMENT FUNDING- TO MARIN COUNTY FOR USE BY CD EIGHT FOUR STATEWIDE TRAINING AND RESEARCH ON DETERRING INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING THESE HIGH TECH CRIMES. CDA HAS RECEIVED GRANT FUNDING FROM VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES OVER TIME THE AMOUNT WILL FLUCTUATE DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT CA. SEEKS AND ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE GRANTS YOU'VE GOT EXAMPLES BEFORE YOU ON THAT PAGE JUST FOR EXAMPLE- THEY RECEIVED ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS- TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE TRAINING ON PERFORMING. YOU AND USING ABUSE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT MEDICAL AND ENSURING EXAMINATIONS FOR EXAMPLE. TURNING TO PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT. THE SIX STREAMLINING IS MONIES THAT ARE RECEIVED PURSUANT TO SETTLEMENTS OR JUDGMENTS IN CASES THAT ARE FILED AND RESOLVED BY THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE CDA RECEIVED AROUND A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM IT CONSUMER PROTECTION CASE THAT WAS RESOLVED BY DOJ. FINAL STREAM OF FUNDING IS BASICALLY PAYMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOURCES TO CDA FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES SUCH AS TRAINING FEES AS WELL THE PUBLICATION CAUSTIC CENTER AND THIS CAN VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. AND SO C. AS AN EXAMPLE CITY A RECEIVED NEARLY SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND IN THESE TYPES OF PAYMENTS FROM DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY. TURNING TO PAGE FIVE OF OUR HAND OUT WE'RE GONNA SHIFT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE AUDIT- SO IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND EXTERNAL AUDIT COMMISSIONED BY CDA. WAS COMPLETED AND IT WAS A LINE ITEM AUDIT OF SETTLEMENTS JUDGMENTS AND GRANT MONIES PROVIDED FOR ROUGHLY SIX ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY RELATED CD EIGHT PROGRAMS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO SO THIS IS A SUBSET. OF CTAS BROADER PROGRAMMING. UNTIL IN THE SCOTT AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FINDINGS. THAT CAN REALLY BE CATEGORIZED IN FOUR IN THREE KEY AREAS. THE FIRST IS THAT CDA ROUTINELY BORROWED FROM IS RESTRICTED FUNDS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY RELATED AREAS AND THAT PRACTICE WAS INSTRUMENTAL. TO ITS FINANCIAL LIABILITY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. SECOND BODY FOUND THAT AS OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION WAS STILL OWED TO CTAS ENVIRONMENTAL WORKER SAFETY PROGRAMS. FROM UNRESTRICTED GENERAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT. AND THIRD THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING PRACTICES INCLUDING THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EACH YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE INACCURATELY REPORTING FINDS ASPEN RESTRICTED. AS WELL AS JUST INTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTS AND PRACTICES RESULTING IN A LACK OF INFORMATION ON WHETHER FUNDS ARE RESTRICTED. AS WELL AS FINANCIAL REPORTS BEING INTERNALLY. INCONSISTENT WITH ONE ANOTHER. CARRIED TO PAGE SIX HAND. CA BOARD TOOK FOR. IN JUNE OF TWENTY THE AUDIT BEGIN. INSTANCE IN THE BOARD. DIRECTED THAT ALL FUTURE MONIES RECEIVED BY THE CDA ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY PROGRAMS BE DEPOSITED INTO A SEPARATE RESTRICTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNT AND THAT COPIES OF THESE BANK STATEMENTS BE PROVIDED. TO ITS CO CHAIRS OF ITS ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE. THE BORDER ALSO COMMITTED TO PROVIDING FISCAL SUPPORT FOR THE CDA ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS FROM ITS UNRESTRICTED GENERAL PURPOSE SOURCES WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE. AND FINALLY THE BOARD- DECIDED TO SET ASIDE AT LEAST 10% UNENCUMBERED OTHER RESTRICTIONS GENERAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT MONIES AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. IN ORDER TO RESTORE THE FUND BALANCES TO THE. ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER SAFETY PROGRAM. WHY PAGE YOUR HAND. THE AUDIT NEED FIVE ADDITION RECOMMENDATIONS- BUT YOU SEE ELAINE ON LATE ON THIS PAGE BEFORE YOU IS INCLUDED TAKING PROACTIVE STEPS TO IN TO ELIMINATE ANY AMBIGUITIES ON WHETHER RESTRICTED FUND ANY RECEIVED FUNDS WERE RESTRICTED I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT- IT ALSO INCLUDED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING AND INCREASING BOTH EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL REPORTING. TO MAKE SURE THAT MONIES WERE TRACKED APPROPRIATELY INCLUDING WHETHER OR NOT THEY RESTRICT IT. AND FINALLY ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED IMPROVING ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND COMMUNICATION IN PARTICULAR WAYS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL REPORTS WERE INTERNALLY CONSISTENT AND THAT THE MONIES WERE BEING TRACKED APPROPRIATELY. SO WITH THAT- WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU FOR A GREAT TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH. O. K. WILL MOVE START IT. WE'LL MOVE ON NOW TO- KEN SPENCE AT NEXT GEN POLICY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS KEN SPENCE AND I'M A SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR AT NEXTGEN POLICY CENTER FIFTH HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WHILE WORKING JUSTICE AND CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION WHICH- ALTHOUGH DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POLICY IS NOT MY COURT AREA NEXT JUNE IS THE JUSTICE IN EQUITY CENTERS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. FOUNDED BY TOM DYER THE FOCUS IS ON A DIVERSE ARRAY OF POLICY AREAS FROM HEALTH AND EDUCATION. THE FOOD SECURITY ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY THE VOTING RIGHTS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SO GIVEN OUR FOCUS THIS ISSUE REALLY STRUCK US WHEN EQUITY AND JUSTICE STANDPOINT. THIS PUBLIC TAXPAYER MONEY WAS INTENDED TO DO JUST THAT. TO PROVIDE EQUITY AND JUSTICE. PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS THEY NEED THIS TYPE OF LEGAL SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE TO GO AFTER THOSE WHO VIOLATE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS INPUT ARCHIMEDES IN HARM'S WAY. IN THE FUNDS WERE LARGELY. THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY A VENOM BARMAN POLLUTION AND DEGRADATION. AND THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE ALONG WITH TEN OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS FELT COMPELLED TO SIGN ONTO A LETTER REQUESTING THAT DECISIVE. AND SWIFT ACTION BE TAKEN HOLD CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS MISDEEDS. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE RESPECTFULLY FUNDS LEGISLATURE IT IS THE FOLLOW. ONE CAN SURE THAT THESE ENFORCEMENT AND TRAINING FUNDS NO LONGER PASSED THROUGH CA. TO HEAR THAT THERE IS A REAL FUSS INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE FULL SCOPE OF THEIR NAFISA. AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS BEEN MISUSED OR MISAPPROPRIATED OVER THE YEARS. THREE HEY WE PAY HIM IN FULL ALL THE MONEY BIXEL. AND FINALLY GOING FORWARD THE CITY AB PROHIBITED FROM DISTRIBUTING FOR RECEIVING GRANTS INTENDED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PUSHING SHRINK. IT'S CRITICAL DOLLARS SIXTY FOUR BUT WE CONTEND THEY GIVEN CAT'S DEMONSTRATED UNTRUSTWORTHY HAS. THE FUND SHOULD INSTEAD BE OVERSEEN BY RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES CAN GO DIRECTLY TO THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICES AND ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS DOING THIS CRITICAL WORK. IN THE FINAL THING I LIKE TO SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW AT A TIME WHEN PUBLIC TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT. PRESENCE THE WINTER MARC. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS YET ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION. FLAGRANTLY IGNORING BOTH THE WORLD'S LEGISLATURE. THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR MOST ON THE TEAM. FOR USING RSOURCES PROVIDED TO PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND FAMILIES COMPARTMENTAL MARC. TWISTING CHAMPION POLICIES THAT SUPPORT MASS INCARCERATION. AND STAND IN THE WAY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE RECORDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SPENCE- WE MOVE ON NOW TO ASHLEY WERNER. I AM ACTUALLY WARNER AND THE DIRECTING ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK WITH FOR YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY AND FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON IMPORTANT TOPICS. LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WORKS ON SITE RESIDENTS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND HE'S COACHELLA VALLEY. MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES WE WORK WITH EXPERIENCED SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION RESULTING FROM POLLUTING LAND USES LOCATED WITHIN AND SURROUNDING THIS COMMUNITIES. IN MANY CASES THE ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS CAUSED BY THESE LAND USES EXCEED LIMITS SET BY LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND OFTEN RESULT FROM LANDOWNERS AND FACILITY OPERATORS. FAILURE TO TAKE REQUIRED STEPS TO REDUCE IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT IN NEARBY HOMES. HE'S AYE LESIONS AYE UNDERMINE PUBLIC HEALTH HOUSING QUALITY AND WELL BEING IN OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND DEEP IN DISPARITIES ALONG RACE INCOME AND GEOGRAPHIC LINES THAT SCAR STATE. I WILL SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE TWO EXAMPLES FROM FRESNO FOR WHICH DISTRICT ATTORNEY INTERVENTION COULD HAVE CORRECTED ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATIONS AND BENEFIT THE PUBLIC. THE FIRST EXAMPLE IS THE DARLING INGREDIENTS MEAT RENDERING PLANT LOCATED IN THE HEART OF THE WEST FRESNO COMMUNITY. WEST FRESNO IS COMPRISED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF BLACK LATINO AND ASIAN AMERICAN RESIDENTS AND RANKS AMONG THE MOST POLLUTION BURDEN NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA EPA'S CALOMBARIS SCREEN TOOL. DARLING PLANT IS LOCATED ACROSS FROM A COMMUNITY PARK AND YOUR HOMES AND EDISON HIGH SCHOOL AND PROCESSES EIGHT POUNDS OF MEAT PER DAY. ODORS FROM ITS OPERATION SATURATE THE AIR IN RESIDENTS YARDS IN PUBLIC SPACES INVADE HOMES ARE OPEN WINDOWS IN EACH FAX SYSTEMS AND BECAUSE RESIDENTS TO EXPERIENCE NAUSEA HEADACHES AND STRESS. I'M TOO MANY OCCASIONS TRACKSUIT LEACHED ANIMAL JUICES AND SPILLED UNCOVERED ANIMAL CARCASSES ON THE LOCAL ROADWAYS. DESPITE THE PLANTS. SIZE AND SEVERE IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THAT FACILITY HAS OPERATED FOR FIFTY YEARS WITHOUT EVER OF TEEN A LAND USE PERMIT REQUIRED BY LOCAL MUNICIPAL CODES EVER UNDERGOING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. THANKS TO THE DEDICATION OF A GROUP OF COMMUNITY LEADERS CALLED CONCERNED CITIZENS OF WEST FRESNO WHO DISCOVERED THE PLANTS LACK OF A LAND USE PERMIT AND TWO FIVE FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS TO ADDRESS THE PLANTS VIOLATIONS. THE PLANT WILL SHUT DOWN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. HOWEVER INVESTIGATION ENFORCEMENT BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE COULDN'T SAVE THESE RESIDENTS COUNTLESS HOURS OF FREEDOM NONPROFIT LEGAL COUNSEL AND LEADERSHIP COUNCIL TO PURSUE OTHER VIOLATIONS. AND HELP SECURE JUSTICE YEARS EARLIER. THE SECOND EXAMPLE I'LL SHARE IS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AMAZON WAREHOUSE CENTER IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO COMMUNITY. AND ITS IMPACTS ON NEARBY HOMES IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THE MOST POLLUTION BURDEN CENSUS TRACT IN THE STATE. DURING THE FACILITIES AROUND THE CLOCK MONTHSLONG CONSTRUCTION DUST CLOUDS FROM CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES COLLUDED RESIDENTS HOMES TRIGGERING ASTHMA ATTACKS AND UNRELENTING NOISE KEPT RESIDENTS AT THE NINETY. ONE RESIDENT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH WHO LIVES ACROSS FROM THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER EXPERIENCE DEAFNESS IN ONE NEAT IN ONE YEAR. SINCE THE FACILITY STARTED ITS OPERATIONS AND IMPACT UNDERMINE RESIDENTS ENJOYMENT OF THEIR HOMES AND THEIR HEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE ANIMATED LIGHT SPILLS INTO HOMES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND INTERRUPTS RESIDENTS SLEEP. HE FROM ENORMOUS CONCRETE STRUCTURES RESULT IN HIGHER LOCAL TEMPERATURES FORCING RESIDENTS TO RUN THEIR AC'S HARDER AND PAY EVEN MORE CREE CHILIES AND FRESHNESS HOT SUMMER. AND TRACK SPEED BY LOCAL ROADS CREATING SAFETY HAZARDS FOR KIDS WALKING TO SCHOOL AND KICKING UP DUST THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR RESIDENTS TO BREED. THESE IMPACTS EXACERBATE DISPROPORTIONATELY POOR PUBLIC HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES IN THIS COMMUNITY OF COLOR. MANY OF THEM ARE APPARENT VIOLATIONS OF LOCAL OR STATE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND SEE WHAT MITIGATION MEASURES APPLICABLES OF THIS PROJECT THE WEST FRESNO DARLING INGREDIENTS PLANT IN SOUTH CENTRAL FRESNO AMAZON WAREHOUSE. ARE JUST TWO STRIKING EXAMPLES OF INSTANCES WHERE DISTRICT ATTORNEY INTERVENTION COULD PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO IMPACTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHILE ENSURING COMPLIANCE. WITH THEIR STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. SAMPLES LIKE THIS ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE IN RULE REGIONS AND WHICH WE WORK. WE HOPE THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE TAKES APPROPRIATE ACTION TO ENSURE THE INTENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT AND TRAINING ACTORS REALIZED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THANK. COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIS GROUP I DO IF WE SEND A NEW ONE SO IT JUST- JUST- KENNETH PICKING UP ON A MISTER SPENCER'S COMMENTS SO I LOOKING AT THE- ELIAS'S RECOMMENDATIONS ONE RECOMMENDATION THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THERE IS TO- IT WILL RENDER THIS. A INELIGIBLE FUTURE FUNDS- IF THAT'S THE CASE WITH ROOM WHY AND HOW HOW WHAT'S WHAT'S- HOW IS THAT THE ACCOUNTED FOR. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER. ARM AND ARGUE ON TRUSTWORTHINESS AND A TRACK RECORD SHOULD PLAY OUT THANK HEAVILY. INTO WHETHER OR NOT- ENTITY IMMUNITY. IS A CONTINUE STATE FUNDING. WE SEE HERE IS I THINK OVER. FOURTEEN YEARS. THE CONSISTENTLY TO ONE OF DOLLARS THE USER FOR THE HOME FOR. SO IT SEEMS LIKE EITHER. IN A CALLING ATTENTION FOR MURPHY WITH ISAAC IT CALL INTO QUESTION WHETHER NOT TRUST WITH ADDITIONAL. SO I THINK WHERE- ARE WORKING COMES FROM IT OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS- THIS WORK FOCUSES. ABOUT ORGANIZATION TO DO THIS WORK AND I THINK WE A MORE. FEES DO SO IN A MANNER THAT WAS INTENDED. I'VE YOUR COMMENTS SHOULD BE TO BE- I THINK GOOD OF THE L. A. O. COULD RESPOND TO THAT. I NEED ONLY OF THE L. L. SO THIS IS THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN BOTH HOUSES ARE INTERESTED AND- WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING ASSISTANCE WHO GENERALLY AND A TECHNICAL. ASPECTS AND DEPENDING ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE GOALS ARE WE ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE- IN EFFECTUATE A MATTER WHETHER IT'S CHANGED A STATE LAW CHANGED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ETCETERA. WE DON'T HAVE A FIRM RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE AND SO OUR HAND OUT WAS REALLY PROVIDING A SUMMARY OF WHAT THE AUDITOR- SOUND RELATED TO CDA ETCETERA SO. I I'M NOT SURE OF THE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION I'M HAPPY TO LEVERAGE FOR NO I THINK IT DOES I THINK IT GIVES US CONTEXT FOR MOVING FORWARD SO I. APPRECIATE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU COULD TELL WITH WHAT'S DISTURBING NOW HERE IS THAT NEARLY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IS OWED. TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL OR WORKER SAFETY PROGRAMS THAT C. D. A. A. WAS- IN CHARGE OF OR YOU KNOW HAD- AND THAT C. D. A. DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO REPAY THIS AMOUNT. I AM A I DON'T QUITE GET. THEY GOT THE MONEY. BUT THEY DIDN'T OF ITS SOMEHOW MISSING I DON'T KNOW WHAT HOW TO. I DON'T HEAR A CLEAR EXPLANATION ABOUT THE TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE UP FOR IT BY. FUTURE FUNDS THAT THEY GET BUT WHAT. WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. SO THE BEST AND EASY ANSWER MADAM CHAIRS QUESTION WOULD BE CA- IN LOOKING AT THE AUDIT- THE AUDITOR WAS THE ONE THAT IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY I WAS LOOKING AT THE AVAILABLE PLANS THAT THAT EXISTED AT THAT TIME IN TERMS OF CASH AND ACT AND ASSETS. AND BASICALLY SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT CA HAD THE HURRICANES OF THAT TIME THERE COULD BE A COUPLE REASONS FOR THIS- SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT COMES INTO CA CAN FLUCTUATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOURCES OF STATE FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE- THE GRANT FUNDS LITIGATION PROCEEDS ETCETERA. CAN VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND SO ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE OF CDA THINK ABOUT YOUR STATE DEPARTMENT ETCETERA THE SENATE YOU'RE MISSING SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS WILL MANAGE ACCORDINGLY RIGHT NOW ALL MANAGED TO THAT FLUCTUATION SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE- THEY HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT DOES EXPENDITURES ARE ONGOING OR TEMPORARY IN NATURE AND SO THAT COULD LEAD. TO SOME OF- THAT FISCAL ISSUE THERE THE FINAL THING THAT I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT IN TERMS OF KIND OF THE REPAYMENTS IS- THAT CDA DOES HAVE OPTIONS IN TERMS OF MAKING MONEY IS AVAILABLE AND SO SOME OPTIONS INCLUDE CUTTING THEIR EXPENDITURES IN TERMS ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE DOING ELSEWHERE. WE WOULD ALSO SAY THAT- FOR LEGISLATORS CONSIDERATION THAT CDA COULD ALSO LOOK AT THEIR REVENUE GENERATION SOURCE AND SO ONE OF THEIR SOURCES OF REVENUE FOR EXAMPLE IS MEMBERSHIP DUES I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHERS- BUT THOSE DOLLARS COULD ALSO BE YOU KNOW ACTUALLY INCREASED TO GENERATE REVENUE IF THE LEGISLATURE- AND CDA FOR EXAMPLE WERE INTERESTED IN HAVING THOSE. DOLLARS REPAID FASTER. I NOTICED THAT YOU TERM BAR MONIES REPAY. BORROWED MY- I'M- AGAIN I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT DID THIS MONEY DISAPPEARS SO IS A MINOR AREAS OR IS IT JUST MOVED AROUND SOMEWHERE ELSE NINE ISSUES THEY THEY SPENT RESTRICTED MONIES AND OTHER PURPOSES IS THAT RIGHT MOSTLY TO ENSURE THAT MONEY'S GONE IT WAS SUSPENDED FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN THE THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE RESTRICTIONS. AND SO BUT THEY CLEARLY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS AT THE MOMENT TO REIMBURSE THOSE FUNDS TO THE APPROPRIATE COUNTY SAID CORRECT. AS A THINKING ABOUT SO WHEN YOU'RE CANCELING YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE STATE BUDGET RIGHT THERE IS THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS. WHICH IS SORT OF UNREST. AND TO SEE HAS AN UNREST GENERAL AS WELL. THIS LEGISLATURE ALSO CONSIDER THE WHOLE RANGE OF SPECIAL AND DOLLARS FROM THERE AND DOLLARS FROM SPECIAL FUNDS GENERALLY HAVE SOME DEGREE OF RESTRICTIONS SOME BIGGER AND SOME LAST. AND SO FOREST ON THE CDA SIDE FOR THESE ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS OR STATE FUNDING SOURCES OR OTHER FUNDING SOURCES IF THEY GET THEM FOR VERY PARTICULAR PURPOSES THEY SHOULD BE GOING INTO THESE. HEALTH PLANS. AND SO WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IS THAT THE AUDIT FOUND THAT DOLLARS WERE BORROW. FROM THE B. IS RESTRICTED. FROM THE LEGISLATURE VIEWPOINT YOU WOULD THINK OF THEM AS SPECIAL PLANS AND USING THEM FOR ON. GENERAL FUND PURPOSES. I DON'T KNOW THAT EXAM HOW- BUT- THAT PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY. YOUR YES CENTER KICKING HIS FIFTH CAN I JUST ASK YOU FINISH THE BOOK BY THE SAME UNGREASED. PURPOSE SUCH AS- WHAT I MEAN IF I AM AS MICHAEL BEST QUESTION OF BECOME A SENIOR. I THINK WE HONOR THE BETWEEN GENERAL FUND TO RESTRICT FRIENDS SO FOR THAT THE REALLY SMALL. LAKE WHAT THE HECK WAS MONEY USED. WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE TO THAT THEY WERE OF OUR- THE FUNDS THAT WERE YOU FOR SOME ELSE BUT I THINK WE HEARD WHAT THE SOMETHING ELSE WAS. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A SORT OF A PUBLIC POLICY INTEREST IN IN UNDER. WAS IT USED FOR CONTINUE THAT. FOR THE BAR FOR IT USED- FIELD TRIPS. YOU KNOW. DISNEYLAND AYE AYE WE DON'T WHAT IT WAS FOR. THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A FAIR QUESTION AND SO- WHEN WE REVIEWED THE AUDIT AND I SIGNED A VERY CLEAR THAT NEED WANT TO THE AUDIT THIS WASN'T. AUDIT DONE BY A PRIVATE COMPANY- HIRED BY CDA. THE AUDIT FAN THAT IT WAS READ READER OR BORROW- AND NOT SPECIFIC SPECIFY HOW IT. THE DOLLARS. WERE USED THAT BEING SAID WE DO KNOW THAT CA HAS ENGAGES IN A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES RANGING FROM. MY TRAINING TO LOBBYING ACTIVITY- IN TERMS OF HOW SPECIFICALLY THE DOLLARS ARE USED TO THAT IS A QUESTION THAT IS BETTER ANSWERED BY CDA AND UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE KIND OF THE PARTICULAR DETAILS. OF HOW THOSE DOLLARS REAIS I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU MENTION THAT CITY AREAS IT DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES ON HAND. TO REPLENISH THOSE FUNDS IT DID THAT MEANS THOSE FUNDS EXCEED CTA'S OTHER RESOURCES M. IS THAT CORRECT IS WHICH TO THAT'S KIND OF ALARMING IF THIS WAS FIRST GOING TO A SPECIAL COUNTY ADDITION SYSTEM. OTHER USES AND I GUESS THE BETTER NOW TUNES AND CORTESE'S LAWYER IT'S YEAH IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A CONCERN. WHO SEEMS TO BE SPENDING IN A ONE CLIENTS FUNDS FOR OTHER PURPOSES- AND SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS DOESN'T SOUND GOOD WITH HIS WAS IT REFERRED BEYOND THE AUDIT MISLEAD SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT JUSTIFY. ADDITIONAL EXAMINATION. EVEN BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. HE STILL IS RE QUESTIONS. ABOUT OTHER FIVE. THAT BEEN PROVIDE TO CDA FOR OTHER PURPOSES SO AN EXAMPLE ON THEIR IT RELATES TO THE YOU KNOW THE HIGH TECH CRIMES THAT WE GET IS AN EXAMPLE OF A STREAM OF FUNDING THE ASSET FORFEITURE DOLLARS ETCETERA. AND SO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE NOW- POTENTIALLY UNDER SCRUTINY WE ARE NOT AWARE OF AN AUDIT SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS CONDUCTED ON THESE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKER SAFETY FINES HAVING BEEN TIME. BUT WE ARE AWARE THAT THERE IS POTENTIALLY SCREWED ME OUT THERE FROM BOTH CA. AND MAYBE OTHERS. PRESHEAF GO TO THE MINISTRY BE WORTH OF. SO ELSE THANK YOU FOR. YEP I FOR THE QUESTION FOR ME IS WEEKLY. AS BUT IS THE EIGHT AND OUR TRUST AND- TO SPEND THINGS A CERTAIN WAY THEY DON'T GET ALL OF THEIR FUNDING FROM US BUT THEY GET A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING FROM US WITH VERY SPECIFIC. RESTRICTIONS OR CONDITIONS ON HOW THEY'RE SPENT AND SO YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT JUST A SORT OF A GENERAL BIG TRUST IT'S THERE IS A REAL DOLLARS AND CENTS HERE AND IT GETS YOU KNOW THROWN INTO THIS IN GENERAL ALL OF FUND. AS FAR AS YOU KNOW USING OUR TERMINOLOGY FOR THEM AND THEN WHO KNOWS HOW IT GETS. SPENT AND THEN- YOU KNOW. WHO KNOWS HOW THAT COULD COULD BE USED OR NOT USED A- EVEN AGAINST THE STATE'S INTEREST SO YOU KNOW I DON'T WANNA REYES AND THE- SPECTER YOU KNOW SPECTER HERE BUT- WE DO HAVE I THINK A RESPONSIBILITY. TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF I THINK IT'S WORTHY OF OUR CONSIDERATION- TO UNDERSTAND THE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR DOLLARS AND TEN CENTS. AND WE'LL HAVE TO GET DIG DEEPER INTO THAT. OKAY THAT MAKES SENSE IN VERY ANNA. ALL RIGHT WELL I WANT TO THANK THANK MISLEAD MR SPENCE AND MISS. WARNER FOR BEING WITH US TODAY- I'M SORRY JUST ONE LAST THING- MISS WARNER ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU WOULD MAKE. SURE THANKS SO MUCH I THINK WE GET THE QUARTERBACK. THAT MR SPENCE MADE AND YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST POINT OUT AND THERE ARE AT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL NONPROFITS THAT DO YOU ENVIRONMENT OF COURSE NETWORK IDEALLY BASIS THAT'S CRITICAL IN THAT SERVICE. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND OPENING UP TRAINING PROGRAMS TO THEM WITH THIS MY I THINK WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL AND FURTHER THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STATUTE AND- AND IN ADDITION OPENING UP ENFORCEMENT MONEY TO POTENTIALLY BE ABLE TO FLOW TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU OKAY GREAT THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND INFORMATIVE PANEL PRECIADO- THIS IS A- JUST FOR DISCUSSION WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON. NOW TO ISSUE SIX. THIS LAST MONTH. FULL YES. OKAY OUR FINAL THIS I IS ON THE IF WERE DUE TO RECENTLY. WE HAVE A CAR GARCIA THE L. A. COUNTY SHE PUBLIC DEFENDER AND TRACY OLD YOUR COUNTY CHIEF PUBLIC IF HERE ON TO PRESENT- MAKE PRESENT MISTER. GOOD AFTERNOON HOW CAN USE FEEL HERE. FORTY COMMITTEE CHAIR NUMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY SPEAKING BUT I'M SORRY MISTER GREG FLEW BIT HARD TO HEAR USER TO OR ARE ARE FOR HELPFUL. GARCIA I AM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND MY STAFF I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR TAKING THE TIME. TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO ADDRESS. THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IS THE LARGEST. AND IT'S THE OLDEST IN THE NATION. I HAVE A STAFF OF APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED ATTORNEYS IT SERVE A COMMUNITY OF TEN MILLION PEOPLE. IF YOU EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT MEANS TO CONTEXTUALIZE THAT SIZE THE NEXT LARGEST PUBLIC DEFENDERS OFFICE AND STATE IS A PARTY THREE HUNDRED IN TOTAL STAFF TO MY TWELVE HUNDRED TOTAL STATEN. AND SERVES A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER POPULATION BASE. IT'S-IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THE WORKLOAD THAT WE NOW ENGAGE IN RELATIONS ADDITIONAL PUBLIC DEFENDER PRACTICES HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR. ALL PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE HOWEVER. ALL THE DEFENSES CHANGE CONSIDERABLY AS JUST REFORM LEGISLATION HAS ADDED RESPONSIBILITIES. PUBLIC DEFENDERS ACROSS OUR STATE. THERE WAS A TIME FOR QUESTIONS OF GUILT AND THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE WHO ARE STILL RESPONSIBILITY. BUT THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE. WELL OUR PRACTICE ONCE FOCUSED ON TRYING CASES BEFORE A JURY. TO GET A BETTER CASE OUTCOME. IS A BALK AT HOLISTIC ADVOCACY TOWARD TEAMS WORK THE GAME BETTER LIFE OUTCOMES FOR CLIENTS. WHAT THIS MEANS IS IT AT TIME PASSED WE FOCUSED ON WHAT WENT ON IN THE COURTROOM. AND THE LEGAL BATTLES AND MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH FROM YOU THEIR TV SHOWS BOOKS OTHER OWN EXPERIENCE IN CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. HOWEVER THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE HAS MADE SOCIAL WORKERS. AS CRITICAL TO CLIENT CENTERED HOLISTIC REPRESENTATION AS PARALEGALS ARE TRADITIONAL LITIGATION. WHAT I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN AT THAT IS THAT AS WE'VE EXPANDED OUR WORK TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PARTS OF WHAT WE DO TO NOT JUST SIMPLY TRIAL WORK TO LOOKING AT THE WHOLE CLIENT. EXISTING ON THE ENTIRE INDIVIDUAL. FROM TRADITIONAL BUT LEGAL ACTION WE NOW WORK WITH. SOCIAL WORKERS TO EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT BRINGS OUR CLIENTS INTO THE SYSTEM. OKAY PUBLIC DEFENSE DEFENDERS ARE BURSTING IN ADDRESSING THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. THATIS WHAT DRAWS PEOPLE INTO OUR SYSTEM. IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS BEFORE THEY GET IT IT'S AN ADDICTION MENTAL ILLNESS POVERTY OR OTHER ISSUES THAT AFFECT FAMILIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND IN PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA AND ARE INDIGENT CLIENT BASE. I TO MITIGATE THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF CONTACT WITH THE LEGAL SYSTEM. AND BY THAT IS THINGS THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED THE IMPOUNDING OF A CAR. A LOSS OF RENTAL HOMES THE LAWSUIT CLAIMING THESE MATTERS IMPACTING INDIGENOUS USUALLY ARE CARSON SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TODAY. AND WE ARE DRESSING THOSE CONCERNS BEYOND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. BUT MORE IMPORTANT. TO OUR CONVERSATION TODAY. WE'RE WRITING THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF MASS INCARCERATION. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THE INJUSTICE OF FELONY MURDER WHICH WAS USED ACROSS OUR STATE WITH YOUNG PERSONS OF COLOR IN PRISON FOR LIFE EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NEVER INTENDED. TO HURT OR KILL ANYONE. AB TWENTY NINE FORTY TWO WHICH ALLOWS MEN AND WOMEN HONEST BUT HE BY FRANCONIAN SENTENCES. THE HOPE OF FUTURE NOT BEHIND BARS THAT IS AN ABILITY TO REDRESS THE CONCERNS OF BACK OUT. HAVE SECURE RELEASE. MANY BILLS A CREATED THE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE PROCESS WHICH GIVE MEN AND WOMEN SENTENCED TO DECADES IN PRISON AS CHILDREN THE CHANCE TO SHOW THE PAROLE BOARD. WHAT DATE WE ALL KNOW THAT THEIR YOU WHICH PLAYED A ROLE IN THEIR CONDUCT SHOULD NOT BE USED TO KEEP THEM IN CAGES. AND A SERIES OF BILLS THEY GIVE IMMIGRANTS SIAPA THIS STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AND NOT. THERE DUE TO APART WITH THE CHILDREN INTO SYSTEM FOSTER. OR DEPENDING ON PUBLIC GATE WHEN INCOME EARNERS OUR RECORD. ALL THESE CHANGES ARE WELCOME REDIRECTION HANDED AND LYFT APPROACH TO WRITING THE PAST WRONGS AND BRING THEM CLOSER THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND PUBLIC DEFENDER. WE ARE THANKFUL THERE ARE ADVOCACY AND EDUCATION AS FOR FRUIT AND WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE TO CORRECT THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF MASS INCARCERATION. AFFECTED BE WORKING TO REDUCE THE BLOATED STATE PRISON POPULATION AND BRING FAMILIES TOGETHER TO REBUILD COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. HOWEVER THE NEW WORK IS RESOURCE INTENSIVE. ATTORNEYS AND SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL SOCIAL HISTORIES AND RE ENTRY PLANS FOR PEOPLE RELEASED FROM PRISON AND EXPAND OUR ONGOING WORK AROUND RESENTENCING AND POST CONVICTION IMMIGRATION RELIEF. PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ABILITY TO CHANGE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM I DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO THE RESOURCES WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN SYSTEM CHANGES ATTICS. TAKING ON THOUSANDS OF PETITIONS THAT REQUIRE CAREFUL WORK YOU GIVE A PERSON THE BEST OPPORTUNITY I RELEASE. AND OFTEN A SINGLE OPPORTUNITY RESUSCITATES GREATER RESOURCES THAN THOSE CURRENTLY SEEN IN OUR BUDGETS DEFEND AGAINST PROSECUTION. OUR OFFICES ARE MOST OFTEN FUNDED TO ADDRESS THE TRADITIONAL LIBERTY MODEL OF FIGHTING ACCUSATIONS ADVOCATE FOR JR. ADULT DEFENSE FUNDING HAS REMAINED TO WORK AS COMPARED TO PROSECUTE. DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUDGETS HISTORICALLY INCLUDES STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HEARD RECENTLY. SUPPORT SPECIAL PROSECUTION PROGRAMS. THEIR INTERNAL SUPPORT TEAMS ARE OFTEN DOUBLE THE SIZE OF PUBLIC DEFENDERS ORTIZ THIS IS NOT INCLUDE THE PROSECUTION'S USE OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS IT FOR THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS. THERE'S NOT BEEN A COMPATIBLE NOR EQUITABLE RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO PROTECT OUR CLIENTS AGAINST THE WELL QUICK PROSECUTION. NO SPECIAL STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDING TO HELP US RESPOND TO THE PROSECUTION'S WELL FUNDED SPECIAL UNITS. HOWEVER IF THERE'S A SILVER LINING THE DAY THE FUNDING REQUEST BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO GET PUBLIC DEFENDERS THEY NEEDED ECONOMIC CONFUSION. TO CORRECT THE IMBALANCE OF THE PAST AND HELP MEN AND WOMEN. PREDOMINANTLY MEN BLACK MEN AND BROWN BACK AND WOULD REGAIN THE FRAGMENT OF THEIR LIVES YOU CAN BUY A SYSTEM DESIGNED AND FUNDED. IN THE PAST THE CASE ALL. GET DEATH. ONE YOU FOR THIS TIME AND NOT TURN OVER TIME TO MY COLLEAGUE TRACY OLSON. THANK YOU. HERE ARE MY NAME'S TRACY OLSON AND IT'S MY FIRST. IT IS THE HE S. THAT BEEN HAPPEN. ONE I HAVE ASKED YOU SEE MORE- CENTER YOU ASKED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS. I'M SORRY HOLD ON MISSILE AND- WE OKAY NOW. OKAY GO AHEAD WE WERE HEARING LOT OF FLAK THAT GO AHEAD. IN ISSUE I FORCED NEWMAN ASKED WHETHER I WAS ABOUT TO FIND THAT WERE REPRESENTING THE QUESTION PERSON THAT PROGRAMS IT IS NOT PUBLIC DEFENDERS. THERE'S A GOVERNMENT CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZES THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING AND IT DOES NOT INCLUDE. AND STATUS ACCORDING TO THE WRITING. THAT ARE GOING THE- WALL HEARINGS LEVINE IT'S VERY NEED TO ACCESS CONTRACT I THINK. I JUST WENT IN THE BACK TO BACK. BUSINESS FOR YOUR GREAT ASKING YOU THE JUSTICE OF CENTER TALKS STATE. YOU HEARD THAT L. A. COUNTY IS OF ABOUT SEVEN I HAVE NO IN FIVE WHICH A LOT OF. THOUSAND SO. SLEEPING WITH THE STRIPPERS OFFICE IN THE PORTS THAT ARE. ELIGIBLE BUT READY FOR WEEK.

IF I REQUEST IS FUNDED BIT OR OF ALL THAT. IS GOING TO GO TO HIGHER SOCIAL WHAT HAPPENED. WE'RE ASKING THAT YOU TO STATE AND- UP SMACKS PARKS. THAT'S ONE IT'S- NEVER CROSS. BIG DIFFERENCE FARM ON YOUR NINETEEN STOP. SPECIAL MY THAT DISCUSSION EARLIER. SINCE BEFORE BACK. THANK BUT YOU VERY MUCH MISS OLSON ARE APPRECIATE YOUR- I USE HOW A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- WHAT IS IT THAT THIS THE STATE DO ABOUT WORKFLOW- WOULD- YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT THAT'S NEED TO A THE WORK. ARE YOU MEANT A SOCIAL. UP OF MY BIGGER THAN THEY HAVE- IN THE PAST- HOW MANY SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ARE ARE THERE NOW ACROSS THE- OF A PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES AND WHAT WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF NUMBERS AND OF ABILITY TO AFFECT THE WORKLOAD. WHERE I KNOW THIS. VETERANS OFFICES DO NOT HAVE. I HAVE TWO ADULTS OBSERVERS WHEN NETWORK PLANS WHEN. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY LA AT THE OTHER SIDE BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS CURRENTLY EXPIRED TO SOCIAL WORKERS. MARK EVEN THE TERMS ARTS DOCKS OUT SOCIAL WORKERS ALL THESE PLACES ARE SERVICE AND ALWAYS THIS IS A STARK PATCHWORK AND VERSUS STRUGGLING STRUGGLING TO GET THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE BUSINESS I WAS YOUNGER SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN BUT THAT DOESN'T. BUT SECTIONS THAT GREAT ESCAPE YES. AT THAT I WOULD TO THAT COMMENT BY THIS AND IS THAT THEN. VARIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY BUT CASE WORKLOADS YES POP TO BUY. WITH A UNIT NUMBER AND I WOULD SAY THERE MORE OR- BECAUSE THIS WOULD IS LOOKING AT THE RATE. OF DEBT- IS MORE PRO DAY ON THE K. SIDE. RETURNS PRESIDENT. RICHARD HAS DONE TO CORRECT THE WRONGS OF MASS INCARCERATION BY GIVING THOSE PEOPLE IN PRISON AN OPPORTUNITY TO REDRESS HARM TO PETITION FOR RELEASE TO ADDRESS JUVENILE INAPPROPRIATE JEWS OUT SENTENCING AND SO I WAS THOSE. NEED TO COME BACK TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE ACROSS THE STATE IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY CLIENTS A HAT THIS IS WORK THAT LAWYERS HAVE TO BEGIN TO DO AGAINST SOME. OF THE BEGINNING WHILE STILL HOLDING ONTO THEIR EXISTING. CASELOADS THEY HAVE ACROSS THE DIFFERENT PARTIES ACROSS THE STATE SO SOCIAL WORKERS. ARE A KEY FACTOR HELPING MITIGATE THE CASELOAD FOR THE ATTORNEYS BY ALLOW BY TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CREATING REENTRY THERE TRULY EXPERTS OF LOOKING AT THE MITIGATING FACTORS AFFECTING A YOUNG PERSON WELL HERE SHE WAS SO CALLED ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AS A CHILD IT LED THEM TO A PRISON SENTENCE WHICH WAS FACULTY WHICH IS DRUG. TESTED THE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE TRULY THE INDIVIDUALS COMMUNICATE WITH FAMILY MEMBERS NOT JUST OF OUR CLIENTS BUT IN IN REAL WAYS FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE PAST VICTIMS- OR- SEARCH FOR RECORDS UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES ABLE. SUPPORT THE TENSION RELIEF BECAUSE ALTHOUGH FOR EXAMPLE UNDER ELEVEN SEVENTY D. OF THE PENAL CODE THIS RETURNEES HERE IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE HAS PARTY'S CRAZY KID HE'S GOING TO. PRISON FOR TWENTY THOUSAND RELEASES IT'S STILL UP TO THE COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL QUALIFIES YOU TO OPEN THE GRANT THAT RELEASE NOT. AND SO PUBLIC DEFENDERS WITH THE HELP OF SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE TO LITIGATE. IN AN ADVERSARIAL SETTING THAT REALITY AND. A JUDGE MAKES YOU. THE INFORMATION NEEDED BY THE COURTS MAKE IT. TO TURN WHETHER OR NOT. A PERSON WILL BE REALLY OR WHETHER THERE'S WILL BE. IT'S VERY. ON THE CALL OF THE INFORMATION THEY'RE PROVIDING. AND THAT QUALITY INFORMATION HAS. ARRIVED AND LIFE AND LIFE ENHANCING SO TALK ABOUT THE PERSON SOMETIMES EVEN FROM BIRTH TO THE CURRENT SITUATION I GOT INTO. IT BECAUSE YOU THAT'S WHY I MENTIONED THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE. GETTING FIND THEMSELVES IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AS WELL AS COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF THAT CONCEPT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH- COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIRD CORTES A BROCHURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN I JUST WANNA SAY- M. S. MAYBE THIS IS A- TO BROADER QUESTION FOR THIS LATE IN THE DAY SO WE JUST ASK FOR AN INITIAL RESPONSE AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING I GUESS. I COULD TAKE OFF WONDER THERE WAS THE COMMITTEE COULD. I SUPPOSE- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE WORK THE NEED FOR SOCIAL WORKERS ALL OF WHICH- I ACCEPTED I BOUGHT INTO- BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT. THE IMBALANCE IN ITS IMPACT ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED OF AND IT SEEMS TO ME AND YOU KNOW COMING FROM OF A FAIRLY BIG COUNTY ANSWER SANTA CLARA COUNTY KNOWING. WITH THE WITH THE DIFFERENTIALS WERE IN HUMAN RESOURCES ARE AN ATTORNEY'S- CAN YOU SPEAK TO GO. YOU KNOW THE VULNERABILITY OF THE STATE WITH THE I'M NOT ASKING TO CREATE A ROAD MAP FOR LITIGATION HERE OR A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE BUT- AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW GIVEN THE DISPROPORTIONATE. THE DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE- OBVIOUSLY IN POVERTY REALLY WOULD BE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE BY QUALIFICATION PEOPLE OF COLOR. MAKE UP A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT YOU'RE REPRESENTING- IF YOU'RE- OUT GUN FROM HUMAN RESOURCE STANDPOINT AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF. THE PROTECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IN AN AND NO THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER BUT I'M JUST ASKING YOU. I I'M JUST I JUST I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO ASK A QUESTION BECAUSE I DIDN'T WATCH ABOUT IN THE PRESENTATION. FOR ILLNESS DURING THIS. I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN ABOUT CREATING A ROAD MAP AS AS YOU CREATE I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS TO- SEPARATE ISSUES THE FIRST IS AS I DISCUSSED IN MY PRESENTATION THERE'S A TRADITIONAL- INDIGENT REPRESENTATION THAT MOST PEOPLE. C. N. UNDERSTAND WHICH IS WHAT. WE CALL THE LIBERTY MALL WHERE INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW IS ACCUSED OF THE- CRIME OR ACTED. THEIR CHARGE BY DISCONCERTING AND WE- REPRESENT THE BECAUSE OUR INDIGENT AND IT'S TO GO TO TRIAL. THAT PART OF OUR PRACTICE IS ALWAYS BEEN A DISPROPORTIONATE- BECAUSE OF RESOURCES AS I'VE INDICATED BEFORE. HAVE COME. TO THIS COUNTRY'S OFFICE. VARIOUS RESOURCES NOT JUST THE COUNTIES IN WHICH- THEY RESIDE OUR RESOURCES HAVE PREDOMINANTLY COME OVER HISTORICALLY FROM JETSTAR COUNTIES. AS A STATE HAS DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITY FOR INJURED RESPECT THE FENCE OF THE STATE- EXISTENCE THE COUNTY- DEVIZES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT IS ONE MODEL AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE AT TIMES FELT. AND STILL COMPUTER STILL. THE RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS IS UNBALANCED- WHAT WE HAVE IS QUITE FRANKLY AND I DON'T THINK CANDIDLY INCREDIBLY DILIGENCE- COMMITTED. PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND WHEN I SAY PUBLIC DEFENDERS I DON'T MEAN ME I AM COMMITTED TO THE WORK I DO BUT I MEAN THE LAWYERS THAT MISSILES AND I HAVE IN OUR OFFICE WHO- SPARE NO TIME ENERGY OR PART OF THEIR LIVES. TO PROTECT THEIR CLIENTS PROTECT OUR CLIENTS. WHAT'S CHANGED NOW AS I MENTIONED DRASTICALLY IS. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC DEFENDERS WELL IGNITED. IS RESPONSIVE WE TAKE ON GLADLY TO ADDRESS OF THE LAWS OF THE PAST THAT CREATED MASS INCARCERATION. THAT WE NOW HAVE A SECOND BITE AT THE APPLE SO TO SPEAK TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WORKED WITH BEFORE DO YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO COME HOME. TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR FAMILY A RATHER THAN THE REST OF THEIR LIFE IN PRISON THAT TYPE OF WORK. WE ARE WE WILL HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR THAT WHEN THE LEGISLATURES PASSED. NEW LAWS ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN THEY COME AND FIND IT-QUITE HONESTLY AND SO WE HAVE HAD TO TAKE IT OUT OF HIGH FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM. EFFECTUATEWHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE OUR OBLIGATION AND QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR MISSILE CENTER MYSELF OR ANY OF OUR PEERS TO CONVINCE OUR ATTORNEYS YOU THOUGHT IT WAS RIGHT NOT TO DO THIS. IT IS A COMMITMENT TO HELPING OUR CLIENTS. BEFORE DURING AND AFTER. A CONVICTION AND SO I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS A QUESTION WITHOUT AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A ROAD MAP FOR ANYONE. BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THE YEAH YOUR BALANCE LAST YEAR I. THINK IT WAS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE PREPARED REPORT. A REGARDING THE- FUNDING. AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS ACROSS THE STATE AS COMPARED THIS RETURNS. AND ONE OF THE- THINGS THAT OUT TO ME THE MOST WAS THE SUPPORT STAFF ALLOCATION SO THEY'RE FINDING WAS APPROXIMATELY SIXTY PERCENT. OF THE STAFF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICER TOURNEY WHILE 40% OF THAT STAFF. ARE SUPPORT STAFF AND THE INVERSE IS TRUE DISCOVERIES SUPPORT AND BY SUPPORTING ME INCLUDING SOCIAL WORKERS PARALEGALS HE ELEMENT. IT LEGAL PRACTICE. BECAUSE OF THAT INVERSION FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE. I'M FORTY FORCED TO DO MUCH OF THE NON PUBLIC DEFENDER WORK THAT IS CLEAR OR THE RESEARCH IT COULD BE BETTER DONE BY EXPERTS SUCH AS SOCIAL. AND THEY COULD FOCUS OUR ENERGY ON THE LORD WHICH IS. WHAT WE WANT TO LARGER. I HOPE THAT WAS pDANCE ON OUR TUNES ROY YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE DILIGENCE- IN THE PASSION AND I'VE SEEN IT AND I CERTAINLY WASN'T CASSIDY IS PERSONS ON THAT- IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. THERE SHOULD BE MORE DILIGENT AND PASSIONATE PEOPLE AND I DON'T THINK IT WOULD DIMINISH THE PASSION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY THERE TO HAVE SOME HELP- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF OTHER ATTORNEYS. YOU KNOW DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH IS. A GREAT BIBLICAL STORY BUT- I DON'T THINK ONE GUY WITH A SLING SHOT YOU KNOW AGAINST SOME AGAINST THE GIANT. PASSES CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WAS GETTING HURT YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE. THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF DESERVE- EQUIPMENT RESOURCES TO THOSE WHO TO THE STATE CONSTRUED SUBSTANTIALLY TRYING TO PROSECUTE THEM. ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THAT'S ALL IT WAS SEEN IN- AGAIN IDEA I APPRECIATE RESPONSE IN. YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR- SERVE YOUR DEFENSE OF THE HARDWORKING FOLKS WHO DO THAT WORK I'VE I'VE SAT IN CONFERENCE ROOMS WITH MANY OF THEM- FOR MANY MANY HOURS IN BRIEFINGS AND HIM SEEN HOW HARD YOU KNOW OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS WORK SO.
