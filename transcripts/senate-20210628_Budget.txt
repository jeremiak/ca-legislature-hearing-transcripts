THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN CONFERENCE COMMITTEES TO RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES IN THE TWO VERSIONS OF THE BUDGET. FAMILY SENATE EDITED THE LIBERTY FORUM AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. DURING THE VERY DIFFICULT BUDGET OF A FEW YEARS AGO FORTY FIVE BILLION IN THE RED AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE'S MEETING. AND DECIDE ON D. FUNDS ARE LOCAL FAIRS. THEY'RE GONNA. AND I RAISED AN OBJECTION THAT WE NEEDED TO DISCUSS. WHICH WE DID. AND I SAID CAN'T WE PUT THIS OVER. THESE FARES ARE VERY CRITICAL. I GAVE REASONS. WE DID AND I SAID MR SHARIF WHO WAS THE ADVOCATE FOR THE FAIR'S VOCAL FIRST SAID HE AND I CAN WORK OUT SOMETHING HERE I THINK WITH THE MAJORITY. KEEP OUR FUNDS- IF THERE'S A LIFE. NOW BUT FOR THAT FOR A MINUTE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. AT THAT NIGHT THE SHARES WERE GONE. THAT IS A MARRIAGE.

CAN THE BILLS. SO WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THIS B. B. J. TRUSTEE MINISTRATIONS CONCERNS- WE RAISED ABOUT THE DEPENDENCE ON HIGHER REVENUE FORECAST. THAT MIGHT NOT MATERIALIZE AS WELL AS OVER COMMITTING TO ONGOING INVESTMENTS WHICH REDUCED. THE BILITY TO RESPOND SHOULD BE FACING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN- OR DROP IN THE STOCK MARKET. THIS JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH PACKAGE- BEFORE YOU REALIZE ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S MORE CAUTIOUS REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND INCLUDES AN EIGHTY FIVE TO FIFTEEN. ONE TIME TOO I'M GOING RATIO IN THIS- THIS FOR DISCRETIONARY FUNDS AND IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE MAIN PROVISIONS NINETY TEN RATIO. IT ALSO SUCKS AWAY MORE RESERVES AND CONDITIONS SOME INVESTMENTS AND FUTURE PREPARATIONS TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER THE- PHYSICAL CONDITION AT THAT TIME- THE PACKAGE ALSO INCLUDES MANY SHARED PRIORITIES SUCH AS UNIVERSAL. TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EXPANDING MEDI CAL COVERAGE TO MORE OLDER INDIVIDUALS IMMEDIATE RELIEF IN THE FORM OF THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS TO. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN SMALL BUSINESS- SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY. IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. ENDING CHILD CARES. AND PROVIDE RATES- RECORD INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND MANY OTHER- IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS- IT TOOK TOO MANY TO MENTION AT THIS POINT- WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE WORK TOWARD A FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT CONTINUES TO UPHOLD OUR SHARED PRIORITIES- AS WELL AS MAINTAIN FISCAL RESILIENCE- INSTRUCTIONAL BALANCE. WITH THAT- I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS AND- JOINED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO CAN RESPOND IN MORE DETAIL TO SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISLI LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS BY ANY OF MY- POLITICS. ONE DAY MADE VIRTUAL YES A SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I AM CHAIR AND THANK YOU- ACTUALLY FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- I APPRECIATE- SOME ANSWERS IN REGARDS TO THE BHAJAN FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA START OFF BY SAYING THAT- REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WAS DONE AND I THINK THAT- CERTAINLY THIS IS A HISTORIC BUDGET ADDRESSES- MANY. ISSUES BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM- DOES THE STATE'S BEEN DEALING WITH INCLUDING ISSUES THAT GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE- GREAT RECESSION OVER A DECADE AGO SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC AND ALTHOUGH WE'RE- HOPEFULLY- GETTING THROUGH PARTS OF IT AND IT'S STILL CERTAINLY. VERY MUCH- GOING ON RIGHT NOW SO. I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE PART OF FINANCE. SO FIRST OF ALL- I KNOWN THE REGIONAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL- THERE WAS FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE I DO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S POINT OF VIEW. THAT PERHAPS FOR THIS UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- THAT- MUCH OF THAT COULD BE FUNDED THROUGH FEDERAL FUNDS. CAN YOU ADDRESS THE COMMITMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO ACTUALLY SPEND US FEDERAL FUNDS ON PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. LABORATORY CAPACITY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAPACITY- NOT JUST PHYSICALLY FOR COVE IT BUT MORE BROADLY AND REALIZING CO THAT IS SORT OF THE ACTIVE THING BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES AS WELL PUBLIC HEALTH- SO CAN. YOU KNOW STAY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE. MAKING INVESTMENTS IF YOU TRY TO HIRE SOMEONE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMIT THAT TEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A JOB FOR LONGER THAN A YEAR ARE PART OF THE YEAR- IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE AND YOU KNOW. BILL THAT YOUR LABORATORY CAPACITY NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE ABLE TO HAVE ON GOING FUNDING TO HELP CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THAT LABORATORY OTHERWISE WHY MAKE THIS INITIAL INVESTMENTS. AS WELL AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TAKES A WHILE SO. IN FINANCE SPEAK TO THE NATURE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WILL BE SPENT IN THIS COMING FISCAL YEAR. GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE SIDE NOT ALLOCATED. SIGNIFICANT FUNDS AT LEAST CERTAINLY NOT AT THE SCALE. ON WHICH THE LEGISLATURE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED. CERTAINLY SOME PAN- AND I'LL JUST I WILL TO FURTHER QUESTION- IN REGARDS TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING. TO MY COLLEAGUE BUT I WOULD. WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT- AND HIGHLIGHT YOUR POINT ABOUT. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET FOR PUBLIC HEALTH- THAT BEGAN IN THAT YEAR PLUS ONE SO THAT'S TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- AND- THAT IS AN ONGOING- INVESTMENT SO IN REGARDS TO. THE AMOUNTS. OF THE% FEDERAL FUNDS I THINK THAT THERE WAS THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD THERE IS THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS. TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH- OFFICES IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THAT THIS WOULD ALSO PROVIDE A PLANNING YEAR FOR ANY ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE STAKEHOLDERS TO GET OGETHER TO. LOOK AT WAYS TO REALLY- REFORM THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE ON GOING FUNDING IN THE OUT YEARS- BUT I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE- ADAM DARCY OR OTHERS WERE ON THE LINE FOR MORE. SPECIFICS ABOUT THE FEDERAL FUNDING THANK YOU. MORE SYNERGY SALT REFINED- YOU KNOW ONE THING I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY RUNNING OUT- IS THAT THE BUDGET CONTAINS ONE POINT OH EIGHT BILLION. FOR GENERAL CORPORATE RESPONSE SO THE STATUS IS VERY RESOURCE. IN THE BUDGET YEAR RESPONSE TO A PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS- ALSO YOU KNOW THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT RULES FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE ARE. WORKING THROUGH- AND WE WILL BE SENDING PLANS FOR THE SPENDINGS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE VERY NEAR TERM- AND BOTH THOSE DOLLARS- ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IS FOR IMMUNIZATIONS AND AN OUTRAGE- THERE'S ALSO EIGHT HUNDRED. PLUS MILLION FOR SCHOOL TESTING- AND- AGAIN THE SCHOOLS BACK OPEN AND THERE ARE OTHER GRANTS THAT WILL BE GETTING WITH- THE GLVC- I GET THOSE OF YOUR. OKAY WELL- INVALID MAY I THINK THAT THAT'S THE NO ONE WOULD DOUBT THAT I AM PERHAPS ONE THE LEADING ADVOCATES FOR VACCINATION BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT FUNDING FOR VACCINATION IS IMPORTANT AS IT IS AND WE CERTAINLY NEED TO GET A VACCINATION RATES UP. IS NOT NECESSARILY PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING SO I AM HOPING THAT THIS YEAR YOU TALKED ABOUTTHE ONE BILLION. FOR COVETED- RESPONSE AND I ALSO POINT TO POINT OUT THAT DOES MORE TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND JUST COPE AND OBVIOUSLY CODES ARE BIG ISSUE- THAT- HOPEFULLY- I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING- FURTHER DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO USING FEDERAL FUNDS THIS COMING YEAR TO BEGIN THAT WORK ON INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. THAT WERE NOT SIMPLY- SAYING THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEND A WHOLE YEAR DOING PLANNING- WE CAN WE ALREADY KNOW FROM THE PANDEMIC SIMILAR WEAKNESSES- SO I DO LOOK FOR THAT THE OTHER QUESTION I DO HAVE AND I APPRECIATE- DIRECTLY BRINGING MENTIONING IT IS THAT- YEAH AND CAN YOU- SO I JUST WANTED. TO HEAR FROM YOU THAT THERE IS A DEFINITE COMMITMENT- FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. FISCAL YEAR BUDGETS SO EXPECT TO SEE THE END OF JANUARY BUDGET NOT SOMETHING WE HAGGLE OVER FOR AT LEAST AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED MILLION- THAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET PACKAGE WHICH ADMITTEDLY IS FOR. SALE IN SOME SENSES- WE'RE REALLY DOING A BUDGET FOR THIS COMING FISCAL YEAR YOU DO ANOTHER BUT FOR THE NEXT ONE BUT THAT THAT IS THERE IS A COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE THREE AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE AND- THE BUDGET PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION FROM THE OUTSET THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE HAGGLING OVER THAT. FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR SO. THAT'S A COMMITMENT RIGHT NOW TO DO THAT. YES WE HAVE THE- BELT THE THREE MILLION INTO THE SYSTEM AND AGAIN- WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AROUND- WHAT-PUBLIC HEALTH OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE- SHOULD LOOK LIKE BEST PRACTICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS- THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT COMMITMENT- I LOOK FOR TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. BUT AS SENATOR NIELSEN GO AHEAD. LET ME FOLLOW MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES. QUESTION THERE. WERE GOING TO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTACT WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN WHAT IS THE FORUM FINANCE FOR THIS CONVERSATION HOW WILL THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE BE FORMULATED AND PRESENTED TO THIS HONORABLE BODY FOR OUR REVIEW. AND HOW COULD WE THE MINORITY PARTY CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YES I GOT IT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE- ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE AND- DAVE THE LANGUAGE AT THIS POINT- IS SOMETHING THAT IS UNDER DISCUSSION- SHOULD BE UNDER SECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE- THOSE ARE WILL BE PUBLIC FORUMS AND- STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHERS- WE'LL BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE THEIR INPUT. THAT IS A NON ANSWER. WHAT SPECIFIC BOROUGH WHAT ROOM MEETING WITH HOME WHO WILL BE INVITED TO THE PARTY. I DON'T SEE THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN INVITED TO ANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AM I CORRECT THANKS THE LAST. I'M OF THE DISCUSSIONS ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH HAVE NOT- TAKEN PLACE YET AND- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN PLAN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. LAND TWO DOESN'T CUT IT WITH ME WE'RE VOTING NOW WE'RE NOT PLANNING NOW THIS IS THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. SO YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THAT QUESTION PURPOSELY I GATHER. TWO HUNDRED MILLION IS REPORTED TO BE CUT FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN THIS PROPOSAL. IS THAT CORRECT. BUT WE WOULD BE PROVIDING THEM. THE HELP THE COST A DAY OF INCURRED WITH THE CV BATTLE. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE YOUR QUESTIONS UNDER NELSON. IS THERE ANY FUNDING BEING REDUCED THAT HAD BEEN APPORTIONED OR PROMISED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BY THE STATE IN OUR BUDGET. ARE WE GIVING THEM LESS THAN THEY WERE INFORMED THEY WOULD GET. I WOULD SAY THAT BROADLY- THERE ARE FEDERAL DOLLARS ARE DOLLARS THAT WERE PROVIDED- AND THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THROUGH THIS BUDGET TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THOSE DOLLARS- HAVE NOT CHANGED. AT EIGHT THEY DID WHAT THOSE DOLLARS OF WHAT FEDERAL R. DOLLARS- TO LOCAL ENTITIES pTHE PASS THROUGH DOLLARS THE FEDERAL DOLLARS IS THAT CORRECT. THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED. OKAY SO HOW WILL THIS. PENDING DEAL AS A PRODUCT OF THE COLD CONVERSATION. HOW WILL THAT BE RESULT WHO'S GOING TO BE INVITED TO THAT MEETING AND WHERE WILL THE MEETING BE HELD. WELL I THINK THAT IT IS SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH EXPENDITURES- I THINK THAT THE IDEA IS TO ULTIMATELY HAVE A BUDGET REQUEST THAT WOULD BE- I DID YOU KNOW. THROUGH B. C. P. PUBLIC HEARINGS- OTHER DISCUSSIONS- THAT ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S THE THAT IS THE PLAN FOR- MANY OF THE INVESTMENTS GOING FORWARD. WELL YOU SEE WE DON'T MUCH MAKE THINGS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ANYMORE. BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT APPARENTLY LATER HERE TODAY. BUT I'M QUITE SURE IT WILL BE ALONG THE LINES OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAD THE END OF LAST WEEK- I GUESS WAS YEAH THE YEAR OF. THE FIRST OR LAST WEEK. WELL WE HAD A BUDGET MEETING HERE RIGHT HERE AND THEN WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT. HOW DOES THAT OCCURS. DID THE PUBLIC GET FINANCE WELL I GUESS SO BUT NOT REALLY. THEY GOT TO CALL IN GET ON A LIST. THROUGH A MODERATOR AND I GOT TO SAY I'M SO SORRY AND I'M REPRESENTING SUCH AND SUCH AND I'M FOR THE BUDGET RUN GETS A BUNCH THAT WAS THE EXTENT OF PUBLIC INPUT. NOT ANYBODY TRY TO ARGUE WITH ME THAT THAT'S PUBLIC INPUT. IT'S NOT IT'S A JOKE. IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS AS WE ARE IN OTHER COMMITTEES AS WELL AS A BUDGET. LET'S JUST HAVE THE MODERATOR TAKE A POLL. OF THOSE WHO ARE CALLING A POLL. SHAKER NAME WHO THEY REPRESENT AND THEREFORE AGAINST. AND THEN GIVE US A TALLY WHY WASTE OUR TIME SITTING AROUND FOR HOURS. WAITING FOR THIS FILE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE LAST THING YOU TELL ME YOU THINK THAT'S A PARTICIPATORY PROCESS EITHER FROM THE MEMBER STANDPOINT OR THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA'S STANDPOINT. WELL I DEFERRED TO THE CHAIR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR THAT DECISION. ALL RIGHT WELL THAT'S A CONTINUED OF THE- ANOTHER NON ANSWER ABOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THERE IS NO HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN OUR COUNTIES SH ARE THEY GOING TO GET ALL THE RESOURCES THEY NEED BY THIS BUDGET. THAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY. I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO SPEAK TO THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH INVESTMENTS. LET'S GO ON TO ANOTHER QUESTION IS GOING TO BE RELATED TO ANOTHER BILL THIS IS A. B. R. S. B. ONE FIVE TWO GOT THE RECALL. THE LAST TIME AROUND THE US SECTOR STATE HAD LITTLE SLUSH FUND. OF MONEY. HE WAS PUTTING OUT NO BID CONTRACT. GOT ROUNDLY CRITICIZED FOR THAT. LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A VERY PARTISAN FAN AND I'M USING A STRONG WORD. BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING HERE. IT SEEMS TO BE A PART OF THE PLAN AM I CORRECT THAT WE'RE GONNA. DO A LITTLE RECALL VANCE HEAR FINANCE DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. FUNDING OF THIS RECALL FUND MONEY. THE DISTRICT STATE. YES SENATOR EIGHTY ONE FIFTY TWO- THE ELECTIONS BILL DOES- PROVIDE THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE AND COUNTY COSTS RELATED TO MINISTRY THAT RECALL ELECTION- THERE WAS ALREADY A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION PROVIDED- FOR LOCALS TO ADMINISTER THAT RECALL. ELECTION AS WELL. SENATOR NELSON WE HAVE THAT ITEM IS A SPECIFIC ITEMS YOU WILL WILLBE WILL BRING IT UP ON YOUR RIGHT NOW TO BE FAIR I BROUGHT THAT UP IN ADVANCE WE'LL DEAL WITH IT AGAIN WHEN WE GET THERE. THANK YOU- DISH ALL GIVES CAUSE FOR A NO VOTE ON THE WHOLE BUDGET- I ALSO JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IT'S- OUR PROCESS FOR- AT LEAST BE OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE'S PROCESS FOR PUBLIC INPUT IS WAS NOT PROBABLY INAPPROPRIATE LINE OF QUESTIONING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CERTAINLY FOR THE FUTURE MONEY. AS WAS INDICATED IN THE QUESTIONING BY SNATOR PAN TO DEPARTMENT FINANCE THE FUNDING FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR BEYOND WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GIVING THE FUNDING THAT THE GENERAL FUND WOULD BE PROVIDING WOULD BE GIVEN IN THE YEAR AFTER SO THERE IS. POP AS PLENTY OF TIME FOR STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN THAT AND IN REGARDS TO THE ENTIRE BUDGET WELL THERE ARE. SOME VARIATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ADOPTED ON JUNE FOURTEENTH THE- MOST EVERY ACTION WAS VETTED IN COMMITTEE AND- EVERY COMMITTEE HAD PUBLIC COMMENT AND EVERY HEARING THAT WE HAVE HAS PUBLIC COMMENT PLUS AS WE KNOW THE BILLS HAVE BEEN IMPRINT FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS WHICH ALLOWS FOR PUBLIC TO ALERT. ANY OF US REGARDING CONCERNS THEY MAY HAVE NOW I CAN IMAGINE YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE YOUR MIKE AND- CRITICIZED THAT PROCESS HOWEVER IT IS A PROCESS THAT WE HAVE FOLLOWED THE BEFORE EVEN REMOTE HEARINGS WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE MORE IN PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT IN OUR COMMITTEE PROCESS OR OUR BUDGET HEARINGS AND IN FACT WE'RE PROBABLY HEARING FROM A BROADER ARRAY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO. ATTEND PERSONALLY TRAVEL TO SACRAMENTO- RED TAG TIME I WILL ALLOW YOU TO MAKE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE AND THEN I WOULD LIKE TO CALL ON SENATOR GROVE AND SENATOR EARLIER. SENATOR NELSON DID YOU WANT TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT. WELL. RIGHT NOW. OKAY SENATOR GROWTH YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR I DID- THANK YOU AS DIRECTOR LEE FOR- ALWAYS BEING WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME I DO REALLY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS HERE- IN THIS BUDGET YOU KNOW THE FUNNY FOR TRIAL COURTS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BACKLOG WE HAVE TO HAVE THE FUNDING FOR TRIALS COURTS AFTER TRIAL COURTS AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION PROGRAMS EARLY INTERVENTION. PRESCHOOL- YOU KNOW CHILDCARE AVAILABILITY WE ALL KNOW THAT- SPECIFICALLY DURING COVETED A LOT OF PARENTS THAT WERE DECLARED ESSENTIAL THAT WE'RE ABLE TO WORK STRUGGLE TO CHILD CARE SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN HERE THERE'S ALSO- SOME VAGUE INFORMATION- ABOUT APPROPRIATING TO- TWO POINT THREE BILLION APPROXIMATELY DOLLARS. FOR DROUGHT RELIEF CAN YOU TELL ME IF ANY OF THAT. IS GOING TO GO TO- SAY FOR INSTANCE THAT THE BILL THAT'S GOING TO BE BUILDING ON FIVE FIVE NINE FOR THE CURRENT- THE FRANKLIN CANAL. WHICH HAS A SUBSIDENCE ISSUE THAT CAN'T DELIVER WATER TO THE CENTER VALLEY OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE SUBSIDED. THIS BILL ALSO AND I KNOW I'M TRYING TO TIE A BILL INTO IT- DOES A ST LOUIS CANAL CALIFORNIA HOW GOOD I CAN OTHER PROJECTS. IS ANY OF THIS MONEY GOING TO GO TO SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS OR IS THIS BEING USED FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. ARE YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER GROVE- I AM GOING TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE- TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION ON TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS. THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU I GOT WAS A PART OF FINANCE- SO YEAH WITHIN THE FUNDING THAT IS SET ASIDE FOR GROUND WATER RESILIENCE THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS SET ASIDE FOR WATER CONVEYANCE AND SO THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT. TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND SO THAT THAT HUNDRED MILLION IS CURRENTLY IN THIS BUDGET. FOLLOW AT I MEAN JUST AS A FOLLOW UP SIR THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE USED FOR THE CONVEYANCE SYSTEM AND FOR THE FREIGHT FROM CANAL OR THAT. WHEN WILL THAT LANGUAGE BE DEVELOPED I'M JUST. TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW WE- CAN PARTICIPATE IN THAT BECAUSE NOT ONLY FOR THE CENTER VALLEY THAT PRODUCES. FOOD FOR THE WORLD- BUT ALSO THE CONVEYANCE SYSTEM DOWN TO LOS ANGELES. YES FOR FRANK HURLEY IS ONE OF THE POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE PROJECTS SO AS PART OF THE LANGUAGE IT DOES IDENTIFY THAT. THERE SHOULD BE AN ADEQUATE NON STATE COST SHARE MATCH- BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN THE CASE OF BRIAN TO THE OTHERS. D. AZ OKAY THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE AROUND A NON STATE COST SHARES- BUT FRANK KERN IS IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE PROJECTS WITHIN THIS FUNDING. BUT WE HAVE NOT SET ASIDE. WHAT'S THIS PROJECT WILL GET WHAT SPECIFIC SET OF DOLLARS BUT IN GENERAL THAT IS ONE OF THE POTENTIAL ALGAL PROJECTS. THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH FOR THAT- ONE MORE QUESTION THAT I HAD- POSSIBLY TOO IS- IS THERE ANY CONCERN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE DAY AFTER THIS BUDGET NEEDS ONE TIME EXPENDITURES THAT WE'D BE RETURNING BACK TO THE OPERATING DEFICITS- BY TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS THERE A CONCERN THERE. THAT THAT WE WILL GO BACKWARDS. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE JUST TO POINT OUT THE LARGE RESERVES THAT WE HAVE- MORE SWEETS ACTUALLY ADICIONAL. DOLLARS ABOVE THE MAY REVISION. AND AS ALWAYS WE- ARE. LOOKING TO BUY TO RESILIENCE AND STRUCTURAL- BEING HAVING THIS- STRUCTURALLY SOUND BUDGET IN THE OUT YEARS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH IS WHY. THE EMPHASIS ON ONE TIME SPENDING VERSUS ONGOING SPENDING. THANK YOU MA'AM. I'M I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE COMMENT FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO AS WELL WHO OPENED UP THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PORTION- I DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE REDUCTION IN THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS. YOU KNOW WITH THE PANDEMIC THAT IT DEFINITELY SHOWED A LOT OF THINGS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE WERE DEFICIENT AND WHETHER IT WAS SAM. PP EMERGENCY MEDICAL SUPPLIES BUT ALSO- OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS WERE NOT READY TO TAKE ON THIS PARTICULAR. MASSIVE WORKLOAD OF THE PANDEMIC. I KNOW WE STRUGGLED WITH IT IN OUR COMMUNITIES- THE THREE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT AND I KNOW THAT. TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES IT WASN'T JUST MY THREE COUNTIES IT WAS- ACTUALLY STATEWIDE. WHERE. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS WERE AND- NOT READY. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WERE READY BUT SPECIFICALLY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AT OUR LOCAL. AND THERE'S A REDUCTION IN THIS SPENDING BUT IN THE COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE GOT LATE LAST NIGHT SHOWS THAT. EVEN THOUGH THERE'S GOING TO BE A REDUCTION NOW THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A FULL FUNDING LATER CAN YOU MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT. SURE SENATOR GRAHAM I THINK- YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE OUT YEARS- PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET AND THAT IS- FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE'S NO- FUNDING PROVIDED. THE FUNDING IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. BECAUSE AS WE SAID THERE. ARE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDS COMING IN. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT NEED NOW. AND SO THE DOLLARS ARE BUILT IN THE BUDGET FOR ON GOING IN THE OUT YEARS. OKAY THINKING THEN THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE I APPRECIATE THAT.AND ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU I KNOW THIS IS BUDGET BILL JUNIOR THAT WE'RE DOING THAT I WAS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO. THANK YOU AND- THE SENATE PRO TEM AND THE GOVERNOR FOR. FUNDING THE BARSTOW VETERANS HOME WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT TO KEEP OUR- INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE SWORE TO DEFEND THIS COUNTRY- AND HAVE DEFENDED THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE AN AVAILABILITY A PLACE TO LIVE. THAT IS SECURE AND SAFE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND ALSO THANKYOU FOR- SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED- LIKE THE- SWIMMING POOLS PUBLIC POOLS IN THE- IN THE MINING AREAS OF THE LITHIUM MINING PLANT. AT PLANT IN BARS- BARSTOW OR BORON ACTUALLY BORON I APOLOGIZE. AND THE COMPANY TOWN. WE NEED TO LIFT HIM TO MEET THE GOVERNOR'S RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS. AND THIS LITTLE DESERT TOWN WITH ALL THESE KIDS- HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY DEGREES IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THE INCREASES IN TEMPERATURE. IN THE DESERT AND THEN SO THAT'S VERY BENEFICIAL. AND I KNOW SOME THINGS THAT AREN'T IN THERE THAT WE HAD- THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW KERN COUNTY PROVIDES 53% OF THE- OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE HAVE A MAJOR US FULL LARGE SCALE SOLAR PLANT WAITING TO BE APPROVED BUT MY COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IS AN- HOPEFULLY GET A FULL MY LEAD AND NOT A- IT INTO WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS SOME- TAX REDUCTION CREDIT THAT COMES TO THE SOLAR COMPANIES. AND FOR INSTANCE I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION THAT 53% THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY IS PRODUCED IN MY DISTRICT AND WE GET NOTHING FOR IT IT GOES NORTH TO GO SOUTH I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMERCIALS THAT LOS ANGELES PUTS UP ABOUT BEING ALL GREEN AND OPERATING ON GREEN TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALL COMES FROM MY DISTRICT IN THESE MAJOR LARGE SCALE SOLAR SOLAR PLANTS ARE NOT IN BURBANK AND THEY'RE NOT IN BERKELEY AND THEY'RE NOT IN SANTA MONICA. THEY'RE IN MY DISTRICT BUT WE GET NOTHING FOR IT AND WHEN I SAY WE GET NOTHING FOR ITS BECAUSE WE TAKE- AGRICULTURAL LAND OUT OF PRODUCTION IN WHERE WE GET TAX REVENUE AND THEN THEY GET A TAX EXEMPTION FOR THE SOLAR TAX- SIX EXCLUSION IS THERE ANY PROGRESS BEING MADE ON THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT MATTER I KNOW THE MAJORITY FLOOR LEADER HAS A BILL GOING THROUGH THE BUILDING TO BLOCK ANY BLACK BACK FEELS ESPECIALLY FOR. LARGE SCALE SOLAR WHICH JUST HURTS AGAIN A COMMUNITY THAT'S PROVIDING THE GOVERNOR IN THIS BODY TO MEET ITS RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS SO JUST CURIOUS IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ON THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT MATTER. HI YES I THINK THE- THE TARGET- INVESTMENTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET ARE REALLY TO HELP. DRIVE THE ECONOMY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THAT REGION IN PARTICULAR IN OTHER REGIONS AROUND THE STATE THAT ARE TRANSITIONING FROM- WHAT TYPE OF WORK FORCE INTO ANOTHER. I KNOW WE HAVE TO TALK. OF WHICH THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED MILLION INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE AND- I THINK THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS IN REGARDS TO HOW THOSE DOLLARS- OUGHT TO BE USED BUT THAT THE GOAL IS TO REALLY- INVIGORATE ENCOURAGING SUPPORT PLANNING. IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING TRANSITIONS SUCH AS- AND THAT IS SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET. OKAY AND I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AS WELL YOU KNOW ON THE GROUND I WOULD SAY ON THE GROUND BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S GREAT INTENT IN THIS BUILDING TO TRY TO HELP COMMUNITIES. BUT WHAT DOESN'T WORK ON THE GROUND- SPECIFICALLY IN CURRENT AND THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION INVOLVED IN ACHIEVING THEM DOING I GUESS BEING AWARDED A LOT OF THAT MONEY. WHO PROBABLY WILL SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT THE BERKSHIRE HIGHER INSTITUTE IN NEW YORK AND SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON CONSULTANTS ON TELLING KERRY COUNTY HAD A TRANSPOSITION AND PROVIDE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. WELL WE DO THAT NOW WITHOUT THOSE WITHOUT ALL THAT MONEY BEING SPENT ON CONSULTANTS- BECAUSE LIKE I SAID WE PROVIDE THE STATE THERE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE THERE'S ONE COUNTY THAT GIVES YOU 53% OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY JUST ONE. AND THAT'S CURRENT-COUNTY. AND SO I AND- I UNDERSTAND THAT I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOME WAY THAT THE COUNTY COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THAT MONEY TO HIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT PAY FOR LIBRARIES. SCHOOLS THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THE COMMUNITY- THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE HAD THE SOLAR COMPANIES PAID THE TAX THAT- THAT EVERY OTHER BUSINESS PAYS. TO HAVE LAND AND PROPERTY IN THE STATE- BUT THANK YOU MA'AM VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT ARE IN THIS BUDGET THERE ARE A FEW BAD THINGS BUT- I APPRECIATE THE GOOD THINGS. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE CENTER LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. I THINK IT WAS TALKED ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS GOING TO BE A CONVERSATION HERE AND I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S BEEN A CONVERSATION GOING ON SINCE JANUARY THE EDUCATION BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT I CHAIR HAD THIRTEEN HEARINGS WE AD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COMMENT- OR ARE WE IN THE END VOTED ON ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL ITEMS BASED ON THOSE HEARING SOME COMMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THIS BUDGET TODAY. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS WE HAD PEOPLE TESTIFY TO US THAT THEY WANTED MORE CHILD CARE SLOTS AND BETTER WAGES AND THAT WILL BE IN THE BUDGET WE HAD PEOPLE TESTIFY FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THEY WANTED THE DEFERRALS PAID COMPLETELY OFF AND THAT WAS NOT IN THE BUDGET THAT IS IN THIS BUDGET. AS A RESULT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD PEOPLE SAY THAT OUR STUDENT AID SYSTEM. WAS AN ADEQUATE. AND THERE ARE REAL. CHANGES IN THIS BUDGET. THAT HAD AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS TO STUDENT AID AND MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE MUCH MORE OF A REALIZABLE GOAL. THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT SAID THAT. THE EXTENSION AND COOPERATIVE AGRICULTURE ACROSS THE STATE HAS BEEN SQUEEZED AND HAS BEEN DYING IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THIS BUDGET GIVES THE BIGGEST CASH INFUSION ACROSS THE AGRICULTURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO BRING BACK FORM AND VISORS BRING BACK EXTENSION. WE HEARD THAT. THERE WERE PARENTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR KIDS GETTING INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THERE IS A PROPOSAL HERE. THAT CAPS THE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS AT THE THREE MOST POPULAR. OUR CAMPUSES IN ADS AND ROMAN SO IT HELPS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MEET THAT GOAL WE HEARD ABOUT THE EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND HOW IT IS HELPED. BY PRE K. PROGRAMS AND A MIX OF CHILD CARE AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND THERE IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME REFORM HERE THAT RESPONSE TO ALL THOSE COMMENTS. SO WHEN WE HAD HUNDREDS OF COMMENTS IT WAS A CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER MONTHS AND THIRTEEN HEARINGS AND THIS BUDGET IS THE RESULT OF THAT LENGTHY PUBLIC PARTICIPATORY CONVERSATION. AND IF YOU LOOK GLOBALLY BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME CURRENT CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT- THE FISCAL HEALTH. OF WE MIGHT HAVE BETWEEN THE FEDERAL MONEY AND THE ONE TIME REVENUE. A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WITH TWENTY FIVE BILLION WILL BE THE AMOUNT OF RESERVE STATUS IN THIS BUDGET THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT FUTURE YEARS THIS IS BALANCED IN THE NEXT FOUR. YEARS BASED ON CURRENT REVENUES AND CURRENT. ESTIMATES THIS BUDGET GIVES PROVIDED WE APPROVE THE STIMULUS THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS OVER ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING ECONOMICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC- IT PAYS OFF THE DEFERRALS AS I SAID SO IT PAYS OFF THE DEBT WHEN WE HAVE THIS ONE TIME. AND THEN. IT GOES TEN FOR IT BUDGETS FOR IMPACT ON SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES FACING CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S HEALTH CARE ACCESS IT ADDS PEOPLE TO HEALTH CARE WHETHER IT'S CHILD CARE AS A SUPPORT. FOR ECONOMIC. DEVELOPMENT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CHILD CARE SLOTS FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO WORK HARD AND LIFT THEMSELVES UP IT ALLOWS FOR A DEBT FREE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. END WITH A SPECIFIC ISSUES WE HAVE WITH THE WILDFIRE AND THE DROUGHT IT ADDRESSES THOSE SO THIS BUDGET IT IT'S NOT AS IF IT WAS DONE IN THE DARK. IT WAS DONE IN FIVE SUB COMMITTEES WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMMENTING WITH PROBABLY SIXTY OR SEVENTY HEARINGS AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE WAY AND WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US IS THE RESULT OF THAT PROCESS SO. THERE'S A REASON EVERYBODY'S BEEN THANKING THE STAFF AND THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE WORKED ON THIS SINCE THE BUDGET CAME OUT IN EARLY JANUARY. AND IT'S IN BALANCE IT'S PRUDENT IT PAYS OFF THE DEBT IT HAS SIGNIFICANT RESERVES AND AN ADDRESS TO SOME OF THE MOST INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. AND SO I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE LOST BECAUSE WERE IN ONE HEARING AND NOBODY UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING OVER FIVE MONTHS THAT WENT INTO IT BEFORE WE HAVE THIS HERE I WILL BE PLEASED TO VOTE. FOR THIS BUDGET WHEN WE HAVE THE CHANCE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I'M SURE THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS COULD SIMILARLY DESCRIBED THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS THEY HELD THE PUBLIC INPUT THAT WAS PRESENTED AND THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUDGET THAT WERE MADE AS RESULT- NOW AS I MENTIONED WE WILL BE VOTING AT THE END. AFTER WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF HEARING. ON THE BILLS SO WE'VE HEARD NOW ON EIGHTY ONE TWENTY NINE THE BUDGET ACT I'M GONNA NOW MOVED TO EIGHTY ONE THIRTY NINE. WHICH IS THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS.

STATE STIMULUS ASSISTANCE AND- IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THESE- THE TARGET AUDIENCES REALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN A MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU- HAPPY NEW TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- HONESTLY LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ON THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS BILL- AND THIS IS THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS TO IT ADDS ON TO THE EARLY ACTIONS THAT WE ALREADY TOOK WHEN THE GOVERNOR INITIATED THE FIRST PAYMENTS TO OUR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND NOW THIS COVERS. THOSE FAMILIES AS MISS LEE POINTED OUT WHO ARE- HAVE INCOMES OF SEVENTY FIVE AND BELOW SEVENTY FIVE K. AND BELOW WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN STRUGGLING DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND- THAT IS. WHAT EIGHTY ONE THIRTY NINE AS SHE DESCRIBED DOES- LET ME SEE I DON'T SEE ANY MIKE'S UP. SO I AM GOING TO MOVE TO THE PRESENTATION ON EIGHTY ONE FORTY TWO WHICH IS THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FOR A NUMBER OF OUR STATE BARGAINING UNITS STATE EMPLOYEE BARGAINING UNITS GO HEAD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ACTUALLY AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M AT ONE FORTY TWO IS- R. M. O. U. ONE OF THE M. O. U. TRAILER BILLS WILL BE HEARINGTODAY- AND THE STATE'S FORGETTING UNITS AGREED IT TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION RATE REDUCTIONS AND CHANGES. IN ORDER TO HELP THE STATE ADDRESS A PROJECTED SIGNIFICANT- DEFICIT AT THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT AND AS STATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THEN AGAIN AT THE MAY REVISION THE REVENUES AND THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION HAVE DRAMATICALLY CHANGED SINCE THEN. AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS ENTERED INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR BARGAINING UNITS TO RESTORE THESE PAY FOR ITEMS AND SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL RATIFIES THE AGREEMENTS WITH THOSE BARGAINING UNITS. AND THE PERSONAL LEAVE PROGRAM TWENTY TWENTY IT RSTORES THE PAY REDUCTIONS IN OTHER PAY ITEMS THAT WERE SUSPENDED. YEAH RESUMES EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PRE FUNDING OF OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ALSO KNOWN AS A TAB- AND PROVIDES GENERAL SALARY INCREASES- THESE AGREEMENTS RESULT IN A TOTAL OF ONE POINT TWENTY TO NINE. BILLION IN BUDGET YOUR COSTS- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE COSTS ARE THE RESULTS OF PROVIDING EACH BARGAINING UNIT WITH TWO GENERAL SALARY INCREASES- AND THESE AGAIN WHERE THESE WERE- ENVISIONED. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT WERE REDUCED- AND- FROZEN- DURING THE PANDEMIC AGAIN BECAUSE BARGAINING UNITS IT KNOWLEDGE AND WERE- PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO THE- TO THE BUDGET- OR SHOULD THE STATE DURING- MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICITS. ARE A POTENTIAL DEFICITS THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL DO NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL. AND UNLESS FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND. ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL. ALRIGHT LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ON THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WHICH REPRESENTS THE AGREEMENTS ON THE VARIOUS STATE BARGAINING UNITS THAT WERE JUST DESCRIBED. ANY QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT SEEING NINE FIVE YES SENATOR KABIR. ACTUALLY MADAM CHAIR I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT- THAT. AND THIS THIS AGREEMENT THIS MOU DOES THAT IS TO- TO TAKE OUR EMPLOYEES BACK TO. WHERE THEY WERE PRIOR TO THAT PANDEMIC- UNBEKNOWNST TO MOST CALIFORNIANS I THINK- THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT ARM OUR STATE EMPLOYEES TOOK. A REDUCTION IN SALARY THIS PAST YEAR AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT. THAT MANY OF THEM WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING US TO GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL AND TOOK. ON IT WHEN YOU KNOW MADE YEOMAN'S EFFORTS TO DO THAT- EVERY SINGLE DEPARTMENT WAS STRESSED BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE SENT HOME AND HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THEIR JOB DONE. WHILE THEY WERE WORKING FOR HOME THEY ALSO- RECEIVED LESS IN SALARY SO I WANNA RECOGNIZE THAT ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR- HIS LEADERSHIP IN MAKING SURE THAT WE MAKE THEM WHOLE AND THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO TO. GET THEM BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE PREPAID PANDEMIC. THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO FOR THOSE COMMENTS I THINK THOSE ARE VERY. YEAH IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE OUR STATE EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO WORK. AND UNDER AND LIKE YOU POINTED OUT AS MANY PEOPLE UNDER GREAT DURESS. AND WHETHER THEY WERE EMPLOYEES FOR EXAMPLE LIKE COVERED CALIFORNIA WHICH PROCESS THAT MANY MORE- HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS FOR FOLKS TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS HAD HEALTH CARE. OR WHETHER IT WAS ANY OTHER OF OUR DEPARTMENTS IN SOCIAL SERVICES HUMAN SERVICES. THEY CONTINUE TO WORK THEY WORK REMOTELY THEY HAD A REDUCTION IN PAY AND THIS THESE AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US BRING THEM BACK. RESTORES THAT REDUCTION AND IN MANY CASES PROVIDES SOME ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WHICH WOULD WOULD BE LEGITIMATE BUT VERY REASONABLE SO THAT WE CONTINUE OUR RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING PRACTICES. AND HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET IN THE OUT YEARS. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TOO WANT TO- ALSO. STRONGLY SUPPORT EIGHTY ONE FORTY TWO AND ALSO EXPRESSED SAME SENTIMENTS AS MY GOOD FRIEND- CENTER COUNTY L. I POINT OUT THAT- WHEN WE WERE THINKING THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A- LARGE DEFICITS IN THE STATE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE EXISTING AGREEMENTS. WITH THE STATE SO WE REALLY HAD NO LEGAL HE FOUND THE GREEN INSTEAD THEY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE. TO GO SHE DID CUTS FOR THEMSELVES EVEN AS WE WERE ASKING THE CENTURY MANY OF THE DO OVER TIME AS WE THINK ABOUT WE'RE SHIFTING PEOPLE AROUND FOR CONTACT TRACING AND OTHER TYPES OF TASKS ADDRESS ASKING PEOPLE TO STEP OUT OF THEIR- USUAL WORK STONE SAID TO HELP OUT IN THIS CRISIS. YET SEEN TIME AGREED TO THE CUT SO I THINK SO CERTAINLY MORE INAPPROPRIATE. THAT GIVEN DAY- FISCAL PICTURE THAT WE SEE NOW WITH OUR STATE BUDGET THAT WE SHOULD KEEP OUR PROMISES TO THEM THAT WE EARLIER MADE. AND RESTORED THEIR COMPENSATION TO WHAT ESSENTIALLY- WE HAD AGREED TO- PRIOR TO A- POSSIBLE AGAIN POSSIBLE- BUDGET REDUCTION AND- THEY STEPPED UP TO TRY TO HELP US ADDRESS THAT AND SO THANK YOU- SUPPORT. THANK YOU DR PEPPER. ALL RIGHT SEEING NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WE WILL GO. TO THE PRESENTATION ON OUR NEXT ITEM WHICH IS- ONE SECOND. IS. EIGHTY ONE FORTY SIX WHICH IS THE FACILITIES FINANCING FOR SOME OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY FACILITIES DEPARTMENT FINDS. S. ERICA LAY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EIGHTY ONE FORTY SIX- THIS BILL LANGUAGE REDUCES LEASE REVENUE BOND OF FORTY CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED BY THE- FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE REMAINING HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM PROJECTS ALSO KNOWN AS HE ACCEPTS- THE FOUR OTHER CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION- BY FORTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION. TOTAL FUNDING NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE REMAINING PROJECTS IS BEING PROVIDED THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND CORPORATION THE BILL ALSO REDUCES THE LEASE REVENUE BOND OF FORTY CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED FOR FOUR SEPARATE COUNTY JAIL FINANCING PROGRAMS FOR THE LOCAL JAIL AN ADULT LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE FACILITY FINANCING PROGRAMS- FOR CDC ARE AND THE BOARD OF STATE. AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. AND THAT'S BY TWO TWENTY- THE INTENTION IS TO INSTEAD ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO EXPAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL ILLNESS. WHO ARE DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON A FELONY CHARGE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL AS WELL. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS ON YES SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I DID. WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE SHUTTING DOWN OR WE HAVE- TAKE SOME ACTION TO SHUT DOWN MANY OF OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES- SO IN THIS PROCESS ARE YOU TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. THE FACILITIES THAT ARE THE FUTURE GOING TO SHUT DOWN WE'RE GOING TO BE RELEASING. A LOT MORE INMATES I KNOW THIS IS IN CONJUNCTION ALSO WITH COUNTY JAILS WHICH ARE PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES WELL SO. ARE YOU LOOKING AT IN THE IN THE POLICY PART OF IT- WHERE WERE YOU LOOKING AT SHUTTING DOWN MORE OR CLOSING PRISONS- AND THAT IN COORDINATION WITH THE COUNTY JAILS THAT PROVIDE FOR THOSE- STATE PRISONS- YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER DOLLY- I WOULD JUST WANT TO POINT OUT- BEFORE HANDING IT THIS. THE DETAILS OF THIS TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT- IT'S THE STATE'S LEGAL OBLIGATION- PURSUANT TO THE PLOT OF SETTLEMENT- TO REALLY FOCUS ON IMPROVING PRISON HEALTH CARE FOR- DISABILITY IS TO PROPERLY ADDRESS ISSUES- AND LEVEL OF CARE THERE- BUT IN IN REGARDS TO- PLANNING FOR PRISON CLOSURES- AND THE DECISIONS ON THIS I LIKE TO. DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE- HURRYING. HURST MORNING CREAM ON RUNNERS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AS IS THE PRACTICE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO MINIMIZE- CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AT ANY FACILITY THAT COULD BE CLOSED IN THE FUTURE. THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SPECIFICALLY DATE BACK TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. AND SO THERE TOWARDS THE TAIL END OF BEING FINISHED AND WHAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU IS ACTUALLY A REDUCTION IN US ALREADY THROUGH LEASE REVENUE. SERVICE AS IT WAS BEING SHIFTED TO GENERAL FUND. IN REGARDS TO THE COUNTY JAIL RELINQUISHMENT IT'S ACTUALLY A REDUCTION IN FUNDING THEY'LL GO TO COUNTY JAILS- AS THEY'VE BEEN RELINQUISHED OUR THEY WERE UNAWARE DEFINED SO IT WOULD NOT CONSTRUCT COUNTY JAILS AT THE LOCAL. LEVEL DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SENATOR. WELL I JUST NOTE THAT IN THE CASE OF CCC IN LASSEN COUNTY THEY DID A BUNCH OF IMPROVEMENTS ON THAT FACILITY. AND THEN. IT WAS SLATED TO SHUT DOWN NOW I BELIEVE IN MY COMMUNITY BELIEVES THAT. THE ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN IT WAS OBVIOUSLY WASN'T FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF US BUT THERE WAS OTHER FACILITIES THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THESE INMATES TO THE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME UPGRADES AND MONEY SPENT ON THEM SO. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY BEING SPENT. AND AS THE POLICY THAT REALLY MATTERS IS HOW ARE WE- GOING TO DELEGATE OR USE THE RESOURCES AND A VERY COST EFFECTIVE WAY SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IS ARE WE PLANNING WE KNOW THAT. THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE INMATES RELEASED OVER TIME. APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND INMATES. WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE FACILITIES. WORK AND MANAGE THESE INMATES SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY REHABILITATE SOME. AND THAT'S THE GOAL SO FOR ME IT'S ABOUT THE POLICY OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE MONEY IN THE END IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN LAID OUT. AT LEAST IN MY MIND. WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD AND MAKE SURE THAT WE- DO THAT GIVE THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED TO GET. AND THEN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT WASTING MONEY BY FIXING SOME. FACILITY THAT WE'RE GONNA EVENTUALLY CLOSED DOWN. I THINK WILL ACCEPT THAT AS A APARTMENT- I THINK IT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES PROVIDED THAT INFORMATION THE SPECIFICS. ON SENATOR DRAWS A- I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO MY OTHER COLLEAGUES- COMMENT ABOUT. A KNOWING IN ADVANCE WHERE WE THINK WE MIGHT BE CLOSING SO THAT WE DON'T SPEND UNNECESSARILY AND THAT WAS A SUBJECT OF A LOT OF CONVERSATION MANY MANY HOURS IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE ON THIS AND- TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WAS THE POINT WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT. WE NEED TO KNOW MORE OR LESS SOME SHORT LIST SO THAT WE DON'T INVEST TENT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO. I AGREE WITH YOU I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS WAS A WE GOT A COMMITMENT TO A MUCH MORE SPECIFIC COMMITMENT FROM THEN AND MINISTRATION THAT WE WERE GOING TO. HAVE THIS KIND OF INFORMATION MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO US SO THAT WE COULD MAKE SOLID DECISIONS ON ON WHERE TO SPEND ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ALL THESE- THINGS THAT COST AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. THANK YOU AS- FOR THAT COMMENT AND SENATOR DRESSER IS CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HEARD THIS- LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY SEEING NO ADDITIONAL WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE'S PRESENTATION ON A. B. ONE FORTY SEVEN. WHICH IS THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY AUGMENTATION GO AHEAD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DIRECTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- EIGHTY ONE FORTY SEVEN PROVIDE AUGMENTATIONS UP SEVENTEEN POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS UNANTICIPATED COSTS. IN THE CURRENT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN REAL REHABILITATION AND SWELL AS THE HOMICIDE TRIAL COSTS- SPECIFICALLY THE BILL INCLUDES AN AUGMENTATION. OF SEVENTEEN POINT TWO MILLION FOR CDC ARE TO FIND UNANTICIPATED COSTS INCURRED TO IMPLEMENT REMEDIAL MEASURES TO KEEP COMPLIANCE WITH- ARMSTRONG COURT ORDERS ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY AND MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS INCLUDES INSTALLING FIX VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS DEPLOYING BODY WORN CAMERAS MODIFYING ITS STAFF COMPLETE PROCESS SEES AND INCREASING SUPERVISORY STOPPING AND BASED ON OUR REVIEW CDCR IS NOT ABLE TO ABSORB THE COST OF THIS MAGNITUDE AT THIS TIME. AND ADDITIONALLY THE BILL INCLUDES TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR GENERAL FUND TO REIMBURSE MARIPOSA. COUNTY FOR THE UNANTICIPATED COSTS INCURRED IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE RELATED TO HOMICIDE TRIAL COSTS. FOR THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS. IN OUR- I'M HAPPY TO RISK TO. THANK YOU MISLI LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS. THERE ARE EIGHTEEN NINETY PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD- WE WILL GO TO THE NEXT ITEM WHICH IS. EIGHTY ONE FIFTY TWO- WHICH IS THE ELECTIONS APPROPRIATION ELECTIONS BILL- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GO AHEAD. YES EIGHTY ONE FIFTY TWO- AS STATED EARLIER THE ELECTION ITSELF AND IT'S GOT THIRTY FIVE HOW THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOOD MATERIAL RECALL ELECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED- AN APPROPRIATE THREE FIVE MILLION TO THE GENERAL PLAN TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE AND LOCAL COSTS RELATED TO ADMINISTER ADMINISTERING THE ELECTION- SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL MAKES CHANGES AND CLARIFICATIONS TO ANY ELECTION CONDUCTED PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO- INCLUDING- REQUIRING COUNTIES TO CONDUCT VOTER EDUCATION AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN- REQUIRING THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO CONDUCT THE VOTER. SORRY JUST ALYSHA PROCESS FOR GRANTING COUNTIES PARTIAL WAIVERS- FROM REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MAX NUMBER OF VOTERS IN PRECINCTS- AMONG AMONG OTHER THINGS- AND AGAIN THIS IT'S THAT THE ALLOCATION IS THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE- FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE SUPPORTING STATEWIDE AND COUNTY COSTS RELATED TO THE SELECTION I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS AND- JOINED. BY COLLEAGUES WHO CAN ANSWER IN MORE DETAIL. THERE ARE A LIMITED THERE'S ANY. FOR TO ONE- SENATOR DOLLY. THE MANAGER BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW- ARE THESE FUNDS GOING TO GO TO THE COUNTIES. OR IS IT GONNA GO TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION IS FOR ADMINISTRATION IT GOES TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO SUPPORT COUNTIES THERE WAS A AN AUGMENTATION PROVIDED. IT THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS IDENTIFIED- THROUGH ANALYSIS OR- INFORMATION PROVIDED BY COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS ANDTHAT IS GOING TO THE COUNTY. OFFICIALS TOOK TWO HUNDRED MILLION GOES TO THE COUNTIES AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION GOES TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THAT'S CORRECT AND THEN. ACTUALLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MINUTES. FIFTEEN MILLION TO THE LOCALS AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AND AS YOU KNOW THAT DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS THIRTY ACTION ITEMS WE TOOK IN THE LAST ELECTION THERE WERE THIRTY FIVE AND THE SECRETARY. NO THE AUDITOR TREASURER WOULD NOT PAY THE BILL SO WE HAD TO RE RATIFY IN THE BUDGET LAST TIME TO PAY THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION. SO HOW IS THIS CONTRACT GOING TO BE THAT IS AT THE- WHAT WHAT IS THE POLICY TO THE- SECRETARY OF STATE AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS THIRTY FIVE MILLION. LET ME TURN THAT QUESTION OVER A MORE DETAILED RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO'S ON THE LINE. GOOD MORNING TIM WEBER DEPARTMENT FINANCE HE'S SEEN HERE ME YES. THE BILL I APPROPRIATE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT THE BILL ALSO STATES THAT- INTENDED THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER JUSTIN'S EMAIL BASED ON THE FINAL COST THE GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS AFTER THEY ACTUALLY COMPLETED. IN ADDITION IT CENTERS THEY HAVE BROKEN OUT THERE IT'S PRETTY CONSTANTLY PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE AND SPECIFICS OF THEIR ESTIMATED FUNDING. SO THAT'S- IT IF I COULD JUST MAYBE PARAPHRASE WHAT I THINK I HEARD. THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION IS GOING TO BASICALLY OFFSET THE COST FOR THE COUNTIES TO FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION IS GOING TO. THE SECRETARY STATE TO. DO VOTER OUTREACH OR TOO EDGY I I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED ON THAT PART I KNOW THAT WE DON'T WANT THE COUNTIES HAVE TO PAY FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION WITH THAT THEY COME OUT OF THEIR GENERAL FUND SO THAT'S RIGHT I'M ASSUMING THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION GOES. BUT THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION I'M STILL A BIT CONFUSED ON WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS FOR YES THE MAJORITY OF IT ABOUT SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ESTIMATE CURRENTLY IS FOR A COMMUNICATIONS AND OUTREACH- AND THEN THE NEXT LARGEST COST WOULD BE FOR THE BORDER MISSION THAT PRINTING WHICH IS ABOUT NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND OTHER VARIOUS CAUSES OVER TIME THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND IT COSTS. OKAY AND WILL THAT WELL THOSE. WELL THOSE BE LET OUT TWO OF THE COMPETITIVE BID AND THEN THE LOWEST BIDDER WILL BE ABLE TO. I DO THE WORK OR IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DONE IN HOUSE WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. WELL THE FUNNY REPLY TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S GOING TO GET BACK TO YOU ON SOME OF THE SPECIFICS OF- REGULATORY COMMISSION DATA WHO DO CONTRACT WITH THAT. NOT APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ALI SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON MY CALLING FROM BEEPERS AT QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS- REGARDING AB SP ONE FIFTY TWO. AM ARE THERE GOING TO BE ASSURANCES TO THE PUBLIC OR WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE IS ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THE PUBLIC AND THAT NO CONTRACT SO THE DIFFERENCE WITH POLITICAL CAMPAIGN TIES LIKE WE EXPERIENCED- IN THE PREVIOUS FEW MONTHS. WHERE I GUESS TEAM BIDEN'S- ORGANIZATION GOT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR VOTER OUTREACH AND OTHER LAWSUITS FILED BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT IS GOING TO BE A FAIR AND OPEN ENDED IF IT DOES GO OUT TO CONTRACT AND WHAT KIND OF ASSURANCES CAN WE GIVE THE PUBLIC THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. AND THAT HAS POLITICAL CAMPAIGN TICE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I DON'T KNOW MR WEBBER DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. FOR THE S. C. ON THEIR EXACT CONTRACT PROCESS AND THOSE CONCERNS. I'M SORRY SIR I DIDN'T HEAR YOU- DIFFERED IN THE- THE SECRETARY SCALES EXACT CONCERNS. FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO CONTRACTS AND SENATOR GROW WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH MORE DETAILS ON THE PROCESS OF THE PROCUREMENT. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND DIRECTOR LEE I JUST LIKE I SAID I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING SOME- STATE RESOURCES- IN PREVIOUS CONTRACTS- AND I JUST WAS CURIOUS AND- REALLY WANTED TO MAKE URE THAT- THIS IS A FAIR AND OPEN BID. AND THAT IT DOESN'T GO TO POLITICAL OPERATIVES THAT WOULD BE FROM ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND THAT AND THE PUBLIC CAN HAVE TRUST IN WHERE THEIR RESOURCES ARE BEING SPENT THANK YOU MA'AM. LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- SEEING NONE WE WILL MOVE TO THE NEXT. BILL BEFORE US WHICH IS EIGHTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT THE TOXICS CONTACT SIX. GO AHEAD IN FINANCE THANK YOU ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EIGHTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. ANSWERS A GOVERNANCE ANDFISCAL REFORM TO IMPROVE GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY AND PROVIDE LONG TERM FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY FOR DTS CD OR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL I'M SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY TO PROVIDE GREATER PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY- IT RESTRUCTURES INCREASES HAZARDOUS WASTE FEES. MAKES VARIOUS PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES AND APPROPRIATE- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR STATEWIDE CONTAMINATED SITE CLEAN UP- AND THREE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION THE CLEANUP RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY SURROUNDING THE FORMER EXCITED FACILITY- IN VERNON OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS. CLICK. IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS- BEFORE I CALLING YOU SENATOR GROVE I WANTED TO INDICATE THAT I'M VERY HAPPY TO pCITY CLEAN UP IN THE AFTERNOON AREA IT IS BANNED- SOMETHING THAT IS. THIS COULD BE SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE HAD. THOSE THAT TOXIC AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THERE AT THE AT THE FORMER EXCITE FACILITY- SO I'M REALLY REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE ARE ACTING ON THAT. AND THAT WE ARE ALSO- INSURING THAT IS JUST AS WE GO FORWARD THAT. HAZARDOUS SITES LIKE THAT HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC SITES THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE APPROPRIATE CLEANUP. BECAUSE IT IS NOT FAIR TO ANY COMMUNITY SETTING BE EXPOSED THAT WAY. SO SENATOR GROVE DID YOU. STILL GO AHEAD AND THEN I'LL CALL ON SENATOR Y. CASKEY. THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THESE SITES ARE BEING CLEANED UP ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY OF VERNON IN THAT AREA- I DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT- AGAIN- I GUESS IN THE BACK AT SO. WE ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES LIFE EXPERIENCES AND I BELIEVE THAT EVERY DOLLAR SPENT IN THIS CAPITAL ORIGINATES FROM BUSINESS. NOW I HAVE HAD ARGUMENTS OR CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT- SAY THEY PAY TAXES TOO AND I AGREE WE ALL PAY TAXES BUT ALL OF THAT ORIGINAL DOLLARS ORIGINATE FROM BUSINESS. AND BUSINESSES PAY PROPERTY TAXES AND THEY BUY BUSINESSES THEY PAY PROPERTY TAXESTHEY SIMPLY TAXES THEY HIRE PEOPLE WHO PAY TAXES ON THEIR WAGES. AND THEY PAY FEES AND FINES AND FEES THAT ARE LIKE THIS PARTICULAR FEE THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT- FOR BUSINESSES TO PICK UP THE TAB ON THAT. BUT EVERY DOLLAR THAT IS SPENT IN THIS BUILDING COMES FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ORIGINALLY. NOW I REALIZE THAT. EMPLOYEES PAY TAXES BUT THEY GET THEIR ORIGINAL CHECK FROM THE BUSINESS OWNER- WE PAY TAXES BUT WE GET OUR ORIGINAL. MANY THAT COMES FROM THE GENERAL FUND THAT PAYS US AS LEGISLATORS- COMES FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SO I HAVE A HUGE CONCERN THAT THIS INCREASE TARGETS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WHETHER LARGE OR SMALL- BY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT. IS THERE A REASON WHY WE'RE TARGETING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR THE THIS PARTICULAR INCREASING D. TSC. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE- THE BILL ELIMINATES THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE FOR APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN THOUSAND BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. SO SMALLER BUSINESSES WILL ACTUALLY SEE A REDUCTION IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL FEE- AND IT DOES RESTRUCTURE THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT VS- IT TO CHARGE ON A PART TIME BASIS TO REALLY REFLECT. THE POLLUTER PAYS- STRUCTURE- WHICH WE THINK IS FAIR AND APPROPRIATE AND SO JUST TO HIGHLIGHT- WELL THERE IS AN INCREASE THAT WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES- THE IDEA IS TO MAKE THIS A FAIRER. WAY DEALING WITH THOSE FEES. THANK YOU DIRECTOR LEE- YOU MADE A COMMENT POLLUTER PAY STRUCTURE WHAT IS THAT- I DEFERRED THAT QUESTION FOR A MORE DETAILED RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE BUT ESSENTIALLY IT IS- THE MORE. THE MORE YOU PAY- AND- I'M NOT SURE WHO'S ON THE LINE BUT I WILL DEFER THAT TO MY COLLEAGUE. HEY ANDREW MARCH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO GENERALLY THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE- REFLECTS EXACTLY AS- DIRECTLY STATED THAT THE MORE THAT YOU POLLUTE THE YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A FAIR COST- ALLOCATIONS FOR THOSE- FOR THAT POLLUTION. AS UNDER THE CURRENT HAZARDOUS WASTE- CONTROL ACCOUNT STRUCTURE- ANY ANY HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATED ABOUT I BELIEVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TIMES ADDED THAT BUSINESSES NOT PAY ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATORY FEES- SO. AT THE END OF THE DAY- THE SMALLER GENERATORS I CAN SUBSTITUTE OR ARE SUBSIDIZING LARGER GENERATORS SO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- BEING A PER TON BASIS REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH. YOU MAKE OTHERS NO CAP- THAT YOU YOU'D BE PAYING THE SAME AMOUNT ON A PART TIME BASIS. AND THANK YOU SO MAYBE I'M MISUNDERSTANDING I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE ENVIRONMENTAL. FEE THAT YOU PAID EVERY YEAR BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT YOU HAVE. SO AND THERE'S A SCALE AT THE END OF THE YEAR A BUSINESS GETS A- REPORT IF YOU HAVE. ZERO TEN FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE TO NINETY NINE NINETY NINE TO FOUR NINETY NINE AND THEN ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED. SO THE WAY THAT THIS TAX IS CALCULATED FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AND- THE MORE EMPLOYEES THAT YOU GIVE A JOB TO AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES THE HIGHER YOUR PENALTY OR TAXES. IS THAT NOT THE TAX WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S GREAT SO THAT'S ONE OF THE TAXES ARE ONE OF THE FEES ACTIONS- CONTAINED IN THIS TRAILER BILLS THE ENVIRONMENTAL C. N. AS YOU STATED IT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES. SO CURRENTLY THAT FEE IS- ON ALL BUSINESSES WITH FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES OR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BUSINESSES AND CERTAIN INDUSTRIES WITH FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES- THIS PROPOSAL ELIMINATES THAT FEE FOR A BIT- BUSINESSES WITH- MORE FIFTY TO NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES- WHICH IS AROUND FOURTEEN THOUSAND BUSINESSES THAT WILL NO LONGER BE PAYING THAT FEE- IT MAINTAINS THE FEE FOR BUSINESSES BETWEEN. FIVE HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES AND THEN RAISES THE C. ON BUSINESSES ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. M. IS IT ONLY RAISED ON THE BUSINESSES OF ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES HAS UP TO THREE HUNDRED AND 20% INCREASE OR- THAT'S CORRECT. SO AGAIN I GUESS AND AGAIN I GUESS IT'S JUST LIFE EXPERIENCES I BELIEVE THAT- YOU KNOW THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT PROVIDE THOSE PEOPLE JOBS AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES- WHY WE TARGET THEM I DON'T KNOW- I DO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A- IT'S POLITICALLY CORRECT I GUESS TO SAY LARGE BUSINESS VERSUS SMALL BUSINESS. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF LARGE BUSINESSES LEAVING CALIFORNIA AND- AT THREE HUNDRED AND 20% INCREASE JUST BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT YOU HIRE IF YOU'RE GIVING. YOU KNOW. IF YOU HAVE NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES AND YOU CAN'T GIVE ONE MORE PERSON TO JOB- YOU'D BE SUBJECT TO THAT INCREASE OF THREE INTERN 20% ON THAT ENVIRONMENTAL TAXI. JUST BECAUSE YOU GAVE SOMEBODY AN OPPORTUNITY HAVE A JOB. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT IN THE- DISPOSAL TRANSFER PROCESS SCENE OF ANY TOXIC SUBSTANCES IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT. THEY DRIVE TO WORK OR- THE AND- IT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU HIRED SOMEBODY- I JUST THINK THAT I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU GUYS DID LOOK AT THAT WE'LL START THERE. I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU GUYS DID LOOK AT THE SMALLER BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE FEWER THAN NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES AND IT DOES SAY FOURTEEN THOUSAND- BUSINESSES THIS TAX AND THAT SEASON ROUGHLY BETWEEN BUT AND I GUESS MY CONCERN ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS THAT YOU'RE EXPANDING THE FEE ON BUSINESS. JUST SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY PROVIDE EMPLOYEES A JOB. I THINK THAT THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE WAY GOVERNMENT OPERATES. ISN'T VERY DIFFICULT A VERY DETRIMENTAL TO BUSINESS THE HIGHER THE WAGES THE HIGHER THE WORKERS COMP. AND THE HIGHER THE WAGES THE HIGHER THE LIABILITY INSURANCE BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS TIED TO WAGES- EXCEPT FOR MEDICAL INSURANCE IS NOT TIED TO WAGES IT'S TIED TO THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES. THAT AND I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER SFI STRUCTURE I THINK THIS IS A STEP FORWARD AT LEAST ELIMINATING THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND. BUSINESSES THAT WOULD HAVE TO NOT ELIMINATE THE TAX NOT THE BUSINESS THE TAXES TO. FOURTEEN THOUSAND BUSINESSES BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT A STRUCTURE MOVING FORWARD- JUST ON. I JUST I GUESS MY POINT IS. RAMBLING ON AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT WHY DO WE PUNISH EMPLOYERS FOR HIRING PEOPLE. THAT'S AWESOME I GUESS MY CONCERN BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ADDRESSING THAT IT IS IT TRUE THAT THIS TAX WILL GO UP- THREE HUNDRED AND 20% OKAY SO. SORRY YOU HAD ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT YOU WOULD ASK THE QUESTION WAS ALREADY ADDRESSED. THE THREE INTERN 20% I HEARD BUT TO GO HEAD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OR YES AND SO OVERALL THE REVENUES FOR THE ACCOUNTS ARE NOT ARE ONLY GOING UP BY AROUND- THEY'RE DOUBLING SO A 100% AND SO I THINK SPECIFICALLY IF YOU LOOK ON A SECTOR BY SECTOR EMPLOYEE. EMPLOYED HERE I THINK THAT'S WHERE THAT 310020% NUMBERS COMING FROM- I WOULD JUST POINT OUT TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT- IT INCLUDING THIS BUDGET YEAR- THE GENERAL FUND HAS PROVIDED AROUND- ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO BACK FILL THESE TWO FUNDS THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT AND THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. AND ADDITIONALLY ONE OF THEIR APARTMENTS FOR THE BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY IN THIS BILL IS TO LOOK AT THIS THE STRUCTURE IN THE FUTURE TO SEE IF THE RESTRUCTURING OF BUT THESE WOULD E APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU N. M. THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT THAT THE GENERAL FUND GAVE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AGAIN THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CAME FROM PRIVATE BUSINESS. AND FOR US TO DISTRIBUTE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I HAVE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE AGAIN THEN SENATOR RECOMMENDED YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED THEN SENATOR DRAW SO. MADAM CHAIR I'M HERE TO REPORT THAT I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH FINANCES NUMBERS I KNOW THAT MAY COME AS A SURPRISE FOR THEM- N. AND I APPLIED- SECRETARY BLUMENFELD AND- GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND EVERYBODY AT THAT AND- AT THE- DEPARTMENT. TO HAVE WORKED ON ON THIS IT IT. IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT WE'VE HAD OVER TEN YEARS OF REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT ON TE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. IN THE CHALLENGE IS THAT IT HAS IT REALLY DOES A REALLY DIFFICULT JOB. NO CLEANS UP IT HANDLES. WITH FACILITIES IN MONITORS FACILITIES THAT ARE. GENERATING WASTE. DEALS WITH THE TRANSPORTATION OF THE RIDE WASTE AND DEALS WITH THE- DISPOSAL. MY COLLEAGUE- FROM BAKERSFIELD WAS CORRECT WITH REGARD TO FACILITIES THAT HAVE OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE YES THEIR FEES ARE GONNA GO UP LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR THERE'S THAT'S JUST THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE WE DIDN'T CHARGE. EMPLOYEES THAT YOU HAVE FIFTY YEARS OR LESS BUT WE'VE THE MOVE THE DEPARTMENT IS COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT SAYS WE'LL WAIT THESE FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE OR SEVENTY FIVE TO NINETY NINE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PAY A FEE ANY ANYWAY AND ANYBODY WHO EMPLOYS BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES IS PAYING THE EXACT SAME ENVIRONMENTAL FEE THAT THEY'RE PAYING TODAY THAT REMAINS THE SAME IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU GET TO THE BIG BOYS AND GIRLS. OVER FIVE HUNDRED THAT THEY'RE GONNA START PAYING BUT ALSO X. ALSO INCLUDE IN THIS IS THE- THIS FLAT. FEE FOR THE GENERATOR SETS NOW GOING TO BE AT FORTY NINE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS WHICH SEEMS MORE FAIR AND THE FACILITY FEES IS ALSO WERE POPPING THAT FOR ALL THESE FACILITIES THEY'RE GENERATING AT. A MINUTE THAT'S THE QUESTION IS WHY BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN RUNNING A DEFICIT BOTH OF THESE FUNDS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS WE KNEW WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SITTING IN FRONT OF ME WAS SECRETARY OF RESOURCES THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE RUNNING A DEFICIT THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR. SEVEN EIGHT YEARS AND WHAT THIS DOES IS TRUE TRUE UPS. THE COSTED IT HAS IN CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WHICH WE NEED WE NEED THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY MAKE BUT THERE'S A BY PRODUCT AND ALSO THE TRANSPORT AND THE CLEAN THEM ONE OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS IT'S- HERE. THIS IS BORED AFTER SEER HERE A YEAR OF HEARINGS AND REPORTS. NOW ON APPEALS BOARD THAT'S GOING TO LOOK AT THE DECISIONS THAT ARE DONE ADDING ANOTHER LAYER OF TRANSPARENCY THE GOOD A GO AROUND TO BAKERSFIELD TO LOS ANGELES TO SANTA CRUZ. TO SILLINESS TO THOUSAND OAKS. TO SACRAMENTO TO HAVE THESE PUBLIC HEARING C. NG GAUGE PUBLIC ON. THE TREE. THE GENERATION AND HOW DO WE PREPARE PRACTICE DISPOSE OF IT SO THIS IS BEEN. A DECADE OF WORK BUT IS THE GUY- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THIS LEGISLATURE I THINK. THEY SHOULD BE APPLAUDED FOR. THEIR COURAGE IT'S- IT'S TAKEN TO BRING THIS BABY ONE FIFTY. EIGHT BEFORE US AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK OVER THEM WITH THEIR- THE PORT OF SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY. SENATOR DRAWS A- YES- I TO RISE TO- SUPPORT AB ONE FIFTY EIGHT AND- THIS WAS. THIS WAS A- PRIORITY FOR THE LA COUNTY LEGISLATORS- FOR THE EXCITE THE MONEY GOING TO EXCITE- WE ARE IN UP THE TAB FOR WHAT EXCITED OVER DECADES. AND OBVIOUSLY. WE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO STOP EXCITED FROM CAUSING THE DAMAGE THAT IT DID- SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THESE COMPANIES- AND THE FEES ARE PAYING THEY DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO WHAT THE- WHAT WE AS TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING. TO CLEAN UP THE MESS AND THE CONTAMINATION THAT'S BEEN CREATED. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT AMOUNT. IS WHAT WE HAVE TO PAY TO CLEAN UP THE SITE ITSELF AND THEN JUST TDAY JUSTIN THIS BILL IT'S- OVER. THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE RESIDENTIAL WE'VE ALREADY PAID SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION TO START THE RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP THIS IS TO CONTINUE THE RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP SO I JUST WE NEED TO. KEEP IN PERSPECTIVE THE DAMAGE THAT IS CAUSED AND EVERY MONTH EVERY YEAR THAT GOES BY THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FULL AMOUNT THAT'S NEEDED TO REALLY. INCOME PRIMARILY LATINO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY THAT SUFFERS FOR EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT GOES BY WITH THE CONTAMINATION THAT HAS BEEN LEFT SO I APPRECIATE THAT THIS WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE- THE CLEANUP. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE THANK YOU. SENATOR EDMUND. THANK YOU. I ALSO. NEED A SURPRISE AND I'M SURE RISING OR NOT. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS I JUST YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL AND- CONNECT SOMEONE DISTRESSED CITY TO KNOW THE COST OF TRYING TO DO DEVELOPMENT AND YOU'VE GOT THESE BROWNFIELD AND TRYING TO CLEAN THINGS UP. MASSIVE SECTIONS IN MY AREA AROUND AROUND OUR PORT AREA THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP JUST BECAUSE THERE WASN'T MONEY TO BE ABLE TO CLEAN THEM UP. AND ALSO JUST I I'D LIKE TO DO THIS. REMARK ON MY THE GOVERNORS AND A GREAT JOB EVERYBODY DOES A GOOD JOB MY FRIEND CHRISTINA GARCIA HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT EXCITED SINCE WE ENTERED THE- LEGISLATURE TOGETHER IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE- SO THIS IS I MEAN. AND THEN I. LOOK FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD TALKS ABOUT ALL ALL OUR MONEY COMES FROM FROM EMPLOYERS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW IN DISTRICTS LIKE HER AND I WE HAVE HIGHER RATES OF CHILDHOOD ASTHMA HIGHER RATES OF CANCER HIGHER RATES OF ALL THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT GO INTO. THE SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE PRODUCE AND AGAIN DO WE NEED THEM YES BUT DO WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO BREATHE THAT AIR WHO DRINK THAT WATER. AND WHO HAVE TO PLAY AROUND THERE. ALSO ARE PROTECTED. THANK YOU- SENATOR DOLE YOUR HOUSTON YES SENATOR DOLLY GO AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I WANT TO RISE ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I WORK AT THE GOOD ASSEMBLY. CRISTINA GARCIA ON DECK SIDE ISSUE AND- I SERVED ON EQ- TOXICS IN THE IN BOTH HOUSES AND- MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT SIDE WAS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THE LOCALS DID NOT DO THE RIGHT THING. LET'S FACE IT THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL. DISTRICT DID NOT DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE. AND THE TAXPAYERS HAVE PAID WE DID WE DID FOLLOW THE MONE IN THE BUDGET. BUT THERE WAS A TWO DOLLAR FEE FOR EVERY BATTERY THAT SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THE GOAL IS TO HELP PAID UP FRONT. AND WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON HERE IS THE FACT THAT WHAT IS THE FUTURE BRING. WHAT WE KNOW HAPPENED IN THE PAST WAS WRONG. WE SAW COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY'RE MAINLY DISADVANTAGED. LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHERE THE MANUFACTURING WAS IN VERNON THOSE TYPE OF PLACES. WRONG WE DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT THE COMPANY WHO NOW HAS GONE AND LEFT AND WHO'S PICKING UP THE BILL. EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT BUYS A BATTERY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS PAYING THE BILL. NOW WE WANT TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S THE GOAL HERE IS TO NOT TO DO THE RIGHT THING CALIFORNIA. LEADS THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY. WE DO WE DO A GOOD JOB HERE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO STRIKE A BALANCE THE BALANCE HAS TO BE CAN WE KEEP THOSE JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA PRODUCE THE PRODUCTS THAT WE NEED. AT THE SAME TIME NOT PUSHING THOSE COMPANIES AND- TOXICS AND THINGS OUT OF OUR STATE WORSE NOT DONE IN THE SAME MANNER. SO THE GOAL HERE IS TO STRIKE A BALANCE. OUR COST OF MATERIALS WILL GO UP. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. AND THESE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO WHEN THEY DO GET THE THOUSAND THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES OR MORE ARE GOING TO PAY MORE AND THAT MEANS THE PRODUCTS THEY PRODUCE. ARE GONNA GO UP. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THOSE ARE THE BALANCES THAT THIS. BUDGET COMMITTEE NEEDS TO STRIKE IT'S GOOD WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WE CANNOT CHANGE THE PAST. BUT WE CAN SURELY CHANGE THE FUTURE. AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE IS TO TRY TO MAKE. GOOD POLICY DECISIONS AND STRIKE THAT BALANCE. AND THE ONE THING THAT FRUSTRATES ME IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT. WE GO TOO FAR SOMETIMES IN PUSHING TO TRY TO MAKE EVERYTHING PERFECT AS WE PUSH WE PUSH THOSE COMPANIES OUT OF CALIFORNIA WHICH DRIVES DOWN THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WORKING SO FOR ME THIS ISSUE IS A REALLY TOUGH ONE. BECAUSE I SUPPORT THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND MAKES OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE BUT THE SAME TIME I DON'T WANT TO PENALIZE THE COMPANIES THAT ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA PUSH THEM OUT. SO I HAVEN'T DECIDED ON THIS BILL YET THIS IS ONE NIGHT WE HAVE A NON ON ON OUR CAUCUS AND I'M DEPEND ON INSIDE I'M DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT. TO VOTE FOR OR OR TO LAY OFF OR TO VOTE AGAINST IT. BECAUSE WE NEEDTO STRIKE A BALANCE THE POLICY HOW IT GETS IMPLEMENTED. ARE KEY. TO DOING THE RIGHT THING IN CALIFORNIA I JUST WANT TO RISE AND SAY THAT. I WORKED VERY CLOSELY ON THIS ISSUE IT'S NOT JUST EXCITED THOUGH. THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT GLITTERS OUT TO US IS EXCITED BUT IT'S- IT'S AGRICULTURE IT'S- IT'S PETROLEUM IT'S ALL THE THINGS WE USE EVERY DAY. IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO STRIKE A BALANCE WILL COME FROM FOR WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO SAY IS THAT I WANT PEOPLE TO STILL STAY IN CALIFORNIA DO THEIR BUSINESS HERE. AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. SO I JUST URGE MEMBERS THAT. WHEN I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO PASS. BUT I URGE YOU TO FOLLOW THE POLICY WHEN IT GETS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED AND MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING IF WE NEED TO COME BACK AND TWEAK IT WITH LEGISLATION. TO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO WE NEED TO DO THAT. BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR INDULGING ME ON THISISSUE IT'S A REAL TOUGH ONE. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WE'RE EITHER GONNA. KEEP BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND DO IT RIGHT WE'RE GONNA SHUT HIM OUT OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE GONNA. BUY THOSE PRODUCTS FROM EITHER CHINA OR SOME OTHER STATE. THAT WE ALL USE AND WE LIVED IN CALIFORNIA WE DO THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR WORKOUTS SKI YEAH. MISS MADAM CHAIR IN AN EFFORT TO- HELP MY COLLEAGUES UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THESE FEDERAL A DIVERSIFIED SUPERFUND SITES REQUIRES A CALIFORNIA PAY 10% OF THE COST TO CLEAN UP AND THEN TO PAY ALL THE COSTS TO MAINTAIN AND KEEP IT THE STAFF REPORT. NOTES THAT WE'RE A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION BEHIND AT. NUMEROUS SITES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED THE STAFF REPORT FURTHER TALKS ABOUT. THE UNIDENTIFIED FEDERAL SITES THAT MAY BE UP TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SITES SO ALL WE'RE DOING IS BY A BARBER DOING MANY THINGS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IF WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE IS THAT WE'RE GETTING. OF FEES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE COLLECTING FROM THE PEOPLE WHO WERE GENERATING THESE TOXIC- MATERIALS AND TRANSPORTING THEM BUT THEN WE'RE PAYING OUR SHARE. TO CLEAN UP ALL THE PAST ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE GONE ON AND GET THAT 9210% MATCHING FUND BECAUSE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THERE ARE OTHER STATES. AND LEGISLATORS ARE MEETING THAT ARE SAYING THIS IS A GOOD DEAL WE PAY TEN PERCENT. THEY PAY THIS IS A WAY. NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING FROM THE EXCITED BECAUSE THE EXITE INCIDENT. SUCKS UP ALL THE OXYGEN BUT THERE ARE THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THE SITE'S IN EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICT THAT NEEDS THE ATTENTION AND THIS IS A PATHWAY TO GET THERE SO. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES CONSIDERED THAT IN THE FUTURE SOME OF THE SITES IN THEIR DISTRICTS HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AND THEY ARE ACTING THEY ARE. FORMER INDUSTRIAL DAY YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE A RESPONSIBLE PARTY THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR THIS SO. UNFORTUNATELY WE IN GOVERNMENT HAVE TO DO UP AT LEAST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PICKING UP 90% OF THE TAP. THANK YOU SENATOR WORKOUTS SKI. ALL RIGHT. SEEING AS NO OTHER COMMENTS. AS CENTER GROVE DID YOU HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO JUST RESPOND JUST BRIEFLY TO MY- COLLEAGUE FROM FREMONT. WE AGREE AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER THAT THERE IS A BALANCE THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS AND I AGREED. THAT THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE PAST NEED TO BE CLEANED UP THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. I THINK pTHAT THOSE- SPECIFICALLY IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. AND THAT HURTS THE POOREST OF OUR COMMUNITIES- I AGREE WITH THAT- MY CONCERN IS LIKE I SAID THE SAME THING FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER. IS THAT. ALL OF OUR REVENUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY DOLLAR THAT'S BEEN IN THIS BUILDING IS- PAID FOR BY BUSINESS AND TO CONTINUE TO. FEED BUSINESS. TO THE POINT WHETHER THEY'RE- A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES FIVE HUNDRED PLEASE IT DOESN'T MATTER TO CONTINUE TO FEED BUSINESS THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME WAY. THAT WE CAN M. LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER SAID STRIKE A BALANCE I DO AGREE FROM MIKE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM AND FREMONT. DID IT THERE ARE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO FOR THESE CLEANUP I DID THESE SITES THAT ARE NEED TO BE CLEANED UP AND IDENTIFIED. AND WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT. BUT IT'S ABOUT MAKING IT WORK ON THE GROUND IF YOU TAKE THE OIL INDUSTRY FOR INSTANCE. CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMPTION OF OIL HAS NOT GONE DOWN OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IT'S ACTUALLY INCREASED IN SOME CASES IN SOME YEARS IT STAYED THE SAME. BUT INSTEAD OF PRODUCING IT HERE UNDER THE SAFE FREEZE YOU KNOW MOST RESPONSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. IN THE WORLD WE TRANSPORT FROM VENEZUELA WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY POLLUTING RIVERS AND- YOU KNOW COLUMBIA AND- YOU KNOW. SAUDI ARABIA. THE YOU KNOW ALL THESE PLACES WERE IN WE BRING IT OVER PRECIOUS. ECOSYSTEM IN BUNKER FUEL- PROVIDED SHIPS. THAT SIT IN OUR PORTS TO BE OFF LOADED- SO. THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY WHERE WE DON'T HE NEED TO FULLY PAY. BUSINESSES SO THAT WE CONTINUE TO PROVE A- HERE. AND THEN WE ALSO ARE VERY ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY AND WE GO BACK AND CLEAN UP. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST WE WEREN'T OPERATING UNDER THE STRICTEST REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. AND PROCESSES. AVAILABLE SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE THOSE FINAL COMMENTS. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I THINK WE HAVE A OBVIOUSLY EXPRESSED OPINIONS ON THIS ONE- SO WE WILL GO TO BE THE NEXT PRESENTATION- WHICH IS THE LAST BUDGET BILLS AND THAT IS AB ONE FIFTY NINE WHICH REPRESENTS THE MO YOU FOR THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT SIX OUR- CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AT EIGHTY ONE FIFTY NINE IS THE MO YOU BUILT FOR BARGAINING UNIT SIX- THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION ALSO KNOWN AS THE C. P. O. A. AND LIKE THE OTHER ON MARKETING UNITS THEY TOO- EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN PAY AND- SALARY AND OTHER PAY ITEMS.

PROVIDES GENERAL SALARY INCREASES AND INCLUDES OTHER ONE TIME ITEMS ADDRESSING THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC CONTEMPLATES HEALTH AND WELLNESS- AND LASTLY EXTENDS THE TERM OF THE AMMO USE A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FROM JULY SECOND. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO JULY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY THREE- THIS RESULT. IN BUT COSTS OF UP FORMER FIVE MILLION GENERAL FIND- AND INCLUDES I'M GOING BECAUSE THIS INCLUDES ONGOING COSTS OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR MILLION. AND ONE TIME COST OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX MILLION. ASIANS UP THIS BILL SIMILAR TO THE OTHER DO NOT TAKE EFFECT UNLESS FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS- AND I AM JOINED BY COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES FOR SOME MORE DETAILED RESPONSES. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE. WE WILL ACT SENATOR DOLLY. YEAH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I DON'T HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT I DIDN'T AT THE PHONE EIGHTY ONE TWENTY NINE BUT I WANTED TO FIRST OF ALL. IF I YOU MAY INDULGE ME JUST FOR A MINUTE. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE STAFF OR STAFF TO. HIS WORK DILIGENTLY- WE WERE ON A ZOOM LAST NIGHT AND I LIKE TO THANK YOU AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES. FOR THEIR HARD WORK. ON THIS BUDGET THIS IS THE LARGEST BUDGET. I BELIEVE IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESOURCES MOVING AROUND. AND I WANNA SAY THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN ALL THESE BUDGETS AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT. OBVIOUSLY I DON'T AGREE WITH BUT THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. AND WHEN I SAY THAT. I WANT TO JUST PREFACE WITH THINGS LIKE BROADBAND. WE'RE GONNA SPEND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. ON BROADBAND. BUT HOW IS THAT REALLY GET EQUALLY TO. OUR DISTRICTS AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND HOW IS IT REALLY GOING TO GET IMPLEMENTED I THINK. WHAT THE POLICY PART OF OUR DISCUSSION IS LACKING. THERE ARE THERE OF IT IN THIS AREA THERE FOUR FIVE BILLS THERE'S A COUPLE BILLS IN THE ASSEMBLY COUPLE BILLS IN THE SENATE. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. HOW MY GONNA GO BACK AND TELL MY CONSTITUENTS WHAT THE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO DO. IT IS PROPOSED AS MIDDLE MILE MIDDLE MILE DOES NOT HOOK PEOPLE UP AND GET YOU. THE MIDDLE MILE. BUT WE NEED THE LAST MILE WE NEED TO. INNER CITY HOUSINGS AS- SENATOR FROM GARDENIA SENATOR BRADFORD WORKING ON THINGS LIKE I'M WORKING ON MY COMMUNITIES. AS SENATOR COPULAR- THERE'S A THERE'S A TO THE DETAILS WHAT'S LACKING SO I JUST WANT TO. PUSH THAT. WE FOLLOW UP IN THESE TRAILER BILLS AND WE ACTUALLY GET SOME DETAIL ON THE POLICY. OF HOW IT'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. THAT'S THAT'S THE PART I THINK IT'S BEEN IN THE END IT'S A I KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT IN THIS BUDGET BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING ON FORWARD. THINGS LIKE PRESENTLY. PRESENT REALIGNMENT WE HEARD FROM THE CHAIR OF SUB FIVE WHO EXPLAIN SOME OF THAT NOT EVERY MEMBERS YOU NEED THAT BUT THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS. THINGS LIKE DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE HOW HOW WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY ON THE GROUND MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM WILDFIRE. SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE. THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE POLICY. AFTER THIS POINT. THERE'S GONNA BE THIS ARE GONNA PASS WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT THE POLICY IS WHAT MATTERS AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT AND HOW IT AFFECTS OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH JUST SHARING ONE LAST THING THERE'S A HUNDRED AND- NINETY SIX BILLION DOLLARS A JET. FUND THERE'S- BILLION DOLLARS. A FEDERAL FIVE THAT ARE GOING TO BE IN. IN THIS BUT- THE DEATH. THEY WERE PILING UP. ON OUR CHILDREN. IT'S REALLY HIGH AND WHAT'S THEIR FUTURE LOOK LIKE. THINK ABOUT WE JUST HEARD THE SENATOR FROM FREMONT SAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA PAY 90% AND WE'RE ONLY GONNA PAY TEN WHAT WERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALL OF US IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE'RE- THIRTY TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT AT SOME POINT THAT BILL HAS TO BE PAID. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE GOING FORWARD AGAIN WITH THE THANKS TO THE STAFF AND IN THE CHAIR AND ALL THE MEMBERS IN THIS IS THAT WE- DOG THIS AND THAT WE- REALLY. LOOK AT THE POLICY AND HOW IT GETS IMPLEMENTED ON THE GROUND TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. BECAUSE THE FUTURE FOR AMERICA AND FOR CALIFORNIA'S GRAHAM IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEBT. WE WANT WE WANT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE FUTURE. AND TO DO IT RIGHT IS MAKE OUR MONEY GO FURTHER THAN IT DOES AND MAKE SURE POLICIES ACTUALLY WORK. SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND SHARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO- WORKING ON THOSE POLICIES IN THE FUTURE MADAM CHAIR.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I RISE TODAY TO SPEAK IN STRONG SUPPORT OF STATE ACTION TO EXTEND THE EVICTION MORATORIUM AND UTILIZE FEDERAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE 1100% PAY DOWN OF PAST DUE RENT. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS TO ENSURE THAT VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA RENTERS ARE PROTECTED FROM THE DICTION AND THAT LANDLORDS ARE MADE WHOLE I'D LIKE TO THINK LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALL OF THE STAFF THAT HAVE REALLY WORKED VERY VERY HARD. TO SUPPORT THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS ALL TOO WELL THE STRUGGLE FAMILIES IN OUR DISTRICT FACE SHORTLY AFTER THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR. WHEN THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS ONE OF MY FIRST CONCERNS WITH HOW PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY. WHO WERE PUT OUT OF WORK WOULD PAY THEIR RENT. PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLES OR KEEP THEIR POWER AND WATER ON. DESPITE ITS MANY FLAWS MANY WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE SOME OF THEIR INCOME SUPPLEMENTED BY THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BUT UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S LONG STANDING HOUSING CRISIS IN EXTREME RENT PRICES MEANT THAT MANY WERE LEFT UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT. IN RESPONSE THE STATE STEPPED IN AND PASSED THE FIRST EVICTION MORATORIUM AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT. FOLLOWED BY SB NINETY ONE WHICH PROVIDED THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING TO RENTERS MOST IN NEED AN EXTENDED THE MORATORIUM. NOW WITH VACCINES PROVIDING IMPORTANT IMMUNITY WE FINALLY SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. MANY SIGNIFICANT COVE AND SAFETY PRO PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN LIFTED MORE PEOPLE ARE BACK TO WORK IN THE ECONOMY IS SLOWLY RECOVERING. DESPITE THIS GOOD NEWS WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP TO KEEP TENANTS HOUSED AND HELP LANDLORDS RECOVER FROM LOST RENT IS TO EXTEND THE EVICTION MORATORIUM. FOR A SHORT TIME IN INSURE 1100% OF THE RENT CAN BE PAID TO LANDLORDS FOR QUALIFYING RENTERS. IN ADDITION TO REVAMPING THE CURRENT CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OFFERED THROUGH SB NINETY ONE WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THE NEXT STEP PROVIDES A LONG TERM SOLUTION. SHOULD A LANDLORD DESIRE TO PRESERVE THE PURSUIT UNLAWFUL DETAINER DETAINER ACTION. AFTER THE MORATORIUM ENDS THERE MUST BE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO ENSURE BOTH THE LANDLORD. AND THE TENANT DID THEIR BEST TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CURRENT RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. FOURTEEN MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. MANY RESIDENTS LOST FAMILY MEMBERS AND LOVED ONES BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS. MANY MORE WERE LAID OFF PERCENT HOME INDEFINITELY THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN IN PARTICULAR IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY THAT FELT THE IMPACT OF THE CORONA VIRUS VIRUS THE HARDEST. DESPITE THE NECESSARY HARDSHIP A STATE WIDE SHUTDOWN BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS COME BACK STRONG IF NOT STRONGER THAN BEFORE- UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOW THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN SINCE THE PANDEMIC YEAH IT'S GETTING CLOSER TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS EVERY MONTH AND OUR STATE REVENUES ARE HIGHER THAN ANYONE COULD HAVE PROJECTED. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN PASS A MEASURE A MEASURED APPROACH THAT PROTECTS VULNERABLE TENANTS HELPS LANDLORDS RECOVER FROM TREMENDOUS LOSSES AND WILL SERVE AS A SAFETY NET TO ENSURE THAT TENANTS DO NOT JOIN THE RANKS OF THE HOMELESS. I LOOK FORWARD THIS MORNING TO HEARING FROM AMY WILSON WHO IS THE DEPUTY DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LEGISLATION WITH BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY JEFFREY ROSS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. WITH THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND LAND BOND **** LIEBERT DEPUTY SECRETARY OF HOUSING WITH BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. THEIR EXPERTISE AND INSIGHT ON THIS ISSUE IS CRITICAL TO FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR KIRBY EURO NOW. WE WILL HEAR FROM THE STAFF WE'RE GOING TO ADD TO THIS THE- HEAD. HE COULD. GOOD MONING TAKE YOUR NAME AND TITLE AND THEN FOR SEAT SURE GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS JEANNIE WILSON- THAT DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR LEGISLATION AND THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY- THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- I'M HERE TOGETHER WITH MY COLLEAGUE AND LYNN MONOCOQUE LEVERAGE- TO EXPRESS THE ADMINISTRATION'S WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO AND TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE- AS THE SENATOR EXPLAINED- EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO MAKES A NUMBER OF CHANGES- TO THE- EXISTING STATE ELECTION PROTECTIONS AS WELL AS. TO THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS. ON ONE PARTICULAR ITEM. IN THE BILL- THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED IN HIS NAME REVISION PROJECT. THE REQUEST SHOULD BE QUICK TO RAISE THE COMPENSATION LEVELS. IN THE STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO PAY 1100% OF AN ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS. RELATED RENTAL DEBT PERSPECTIVE RENTS AND UTILITIES. THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THIS INCREASE IN PAYMENT LEVELS IS CRITICAL ANDNECESSARY TO GET MUCH NEEDED FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR TO STABILIZE. TENANTS AND THEIR LANDLORDS AND TO SUPPORT AN EQUITABLE ECONOMIC TRANSITION TO THE PAST AND IN THE STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS NOW FULLY THREE MONTHS INTO IMPLEMENTATION. IT BEGAN ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS ON MARCH FIFTEENTH STARTED ISSUING PAYMENTS IN MID APRIL. OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF MAKING PAYMENTS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STOP THE RATE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE ISSUED AND THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS THERE. CHANGING PAINT IN THE PAYMENT LEVELS IN EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO IS CRITICAL TO OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO SWIFTLY DELIVER THESE FUNDS TO CALIFORNIA TENANTS AND LANDLORDS. I HAD TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE IT INTO. THE REDDIT GETTING RENTAL DEBT AND SHORT TERM. AND PROVIDING ONGOING SUPPORT TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT CONTINUE TO RECOVER FROM THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC IS THE MISSION OF THIS PROGRAM. FOLLOWING THE DOLLARS MORE QUICKLY ALSO ENABLES THE STATE TO STAY ON PACE TO MEET OUR SPENDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW. DOING SO PUTS THE STATE IN A POSITION TO POTENTIALLY RECEIVE MORE DOLLARS FROM BRANCHES ACROSS THE NATION THAT HAVE UNUSED FUND FUNDS AND NOT AS THE G. AS CALIFORNIA. BRIEFLY I WILL NOTE THAT EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO INCLUDES OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WILL SUPPORT PROGRAM PARTICIPATION. FIRST THE EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT EVICTION PROTECTIONS AFTER SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH WILL KEEP CALIFORNIANS HOUSE AND PROVIDE THE STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS ADDITIONAL TIME TO DEPLOY THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCE- ACCORDINGLY THE EXTENDED PROTECTION. ALSO INCLUDES A REVISED NOTICE THAT POINTS TEN INTO OUR CALL CENTER AND- HELP LINE TO THE STATE WEBSITE TO DIRECT THEM ON HOW AND WHERE TO APPLY FOR AT LEAST- SECOND FOLLOWING THE END OF THE PROTECTION EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO ESTABLISHES A TEMPORARY COURT PROCESS STARTING OCTOBER ONE. THIS COURT PROCESS WILL BE IN EFFECT UNTIL MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND IT PROVIDES A TAPERING OFF TO ENSURE HOUSEHOLDS IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE REMAIN PROTECTED S. FUNDS CONTINUE TO BE ALLOCATED ACROSS STATE. IN CLOSING THIS DATA RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS POISED AND READY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED BY EIGHTY EIGHT THREE TWO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION AND THANK THE AUTHORS LEGISLATURE FOR ADVANCING IT. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WAS THERE ANOTHER. DEPARTMENTAL REP THAT WAS GOING TO PRESENTERS THAT. OKAY LET ME SEE IF THERE'S- ANY OTHER END SORRY ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MY COLLEAGUES SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. THANK YOU MANAGER I HAVE A QUESTION. REGARDING THE EMERGENCY THE PROGRAMMER SOME CHANGES HI ALL I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME IS OF A BULLET POINT BUT IT'S WHERE THE TENANT NO LONGER OCCUPIES THE UNIT. BUT STILL- RULES POSTER READ WE'RE WITH THE WE'RE WITH THE AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS GO WOULD IT GO TO THE LANDLORD DIRECTLY ON THE ARREARS OR DOES IT GO TO THE TENANT EVEN THOUGH THE TENANTS NOT THERE. HOW WILL THAT WORK. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SENATOR. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME BECAUSE I'M NOT PICTURED AT RIGHT NOW- SITTING THAT YOU CAN HEAR- SO THE- THE BILL DOES AUTHORIZE. NON OCCUPANCY SITUATIONS WHERE THE- TENANT IS NO LONGER THEY HAVE LIKE SELF VACATED- THEY HAVE MOVED OUT BUT THE- RENTAL ARREARS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE SITUATIONS WERE STILL ELIGIBLE THE- FUNDING IF THEY ARE WE WERE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE LANDLORD OF THE FUNDING WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE LANDLORD- AS IT DOES- IN THAT SITUATION IN OCCUPANCY SITUATIONS- IF WE ARE UNABLE TO HAVE. LANDLORD RESPONSE I'M IN THAT SITUATION- THE TENANT DOES- ATTEST UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE FUNDS ARE TO BE USED FOR THE STATED PURPOSE OF PAYING THE RENTAL ARREARS AND- THEY RECEIVE EITHER YOU KNOW THE CHECK OR THE TRANSFER AND AGAIN IT'S ALL- STATED CLEARLY ON THE PAYMENT WHAT IT'S FOR AND THEN- THE BILL DOES ALSO REQUIRE THAT. THAT PAYMENT TO THE TENANT WAS THEN CONVEYED TO THE LANDLORD WITHIN. FIFTEEN DAYS. AND IF IT IS NOT THE LAN IS A TO FIX- A. PENALTY FEE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IF I MAY GOING ON AND WITH REGARD TO THE TERM OF THE LEASE IF THE TENANT. VOLUNTARILY LEFT TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE TERM OF THE LEASE WAS WAS- EXPIRED DOES THAT- THIS PROGRAM ALLOW FOR THAT. A REQUEST FOR THE PAYMENT OF THOSE TWO MONTHS WHEN IT WOULD BE VACANT UNDER THE- UNDER THE CONTRACT. CAN I TRANSFER THAT QUESTION ALREADY YOU CAN. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LIVE ON COOK LEADER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF HOUSING AT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE HOUSING AGENCY I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION IN THAT CASE NO BECAUSE THE- THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS SET UP WITH UNDER UNDER THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT IT'S LINKED TO THE AND THAT THE TENANT AND THE TENANT TIME IN IN INDIA THE APARTMENT OR THAT THE UNIT. OF THE TENANT HOUSE AT THE TIME THE TENANT ADVOCATED THAT WOULD BE THE END POINT THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLICATE THAT LANDMARK FOR THE TIME THAT. THE TENANT WAS NOT MAKING A PAYMENT. SENATOR Y. CASKEY SAID ANSWER. I JUST WOULDN'T- NOTE THAT THE IT'S A FEDERAL GUIDELINES WE HAVE TO FILE FEDERAL GUIDELINES BUT BUT THAT WOULD IF THE JUDGE WAS SITTING IN AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION AND WOULD SAY THAT BECAUSE I'M CONTRACTUALLY THAT THAT TENANT ALTHOUGH THEY VOLUNTARILY LEFT TO TRY TO YOU KNOW GO ON TO GREENER PASTURES THEY WOULD BE LIABLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT FOR TWO. FOR TWO MONTHS SO THAT WILL BE. WE'LL OBVIOUSLY THE BACKSTOP PROCESS WITH AGE. THAT THAT SET UP IN THE BILL WILL PROVIDE US WITH THAT INFORMATION TELL ME BUT I CAN SEE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE FALLING INTO THAT. THAT CATEGORY BECAUSE THEY DECIDED THEY JUST LEFT WITH WERE ON THIS PROGRAM IT EVEN BETTER FOR THEM JUST TO STAY PUT TILL THE END OF THE TERM SO. THANK THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS OF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF- BUT I CAN GET SOME CLARITY- BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A MIX EITHER IN ACTUAL FUNDING OR IN TERMS OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS- THE RELIEF AVAILABLE FOR RENT BUT ALSO WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND HOW. DO YOU GET ACCESS TO UTILITY DEBT RELIEF I'VE SEEN THE SOMETIMES IN THE SAME SENTENCE SOMETIMES AS A SEPARATE BUT COULD YOU- CLARIFY THAT. I'M INTERESTED I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT QUESTION I'M STILL RENTING UTILITIES AND CAN BE CAPTURED IN IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. THE FIRST ONE NAME- WHEN AFRICANS AT COMPLETE THAT AND APPLICATION THEY'RE REQUESTED TO PUT IN ALL THEIR INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR RENT AND UTILITY AND- BEAT THEIR REQUEST TO PUT IN THE INFORMATION IF THEY PAY THEIR UTILITIES AS PART OF THEIR BUNDLED FRENCH TOAST THEY EXAMINE CLUES THAT INCLUDED IN THE MONTHLY COST TO THEIR LANDLORD. OR AND OR IF THEY PAY THEIR UTILITIES. DIRECTLY TO UTILITY PROVIDER. IF THE RENT IF THE UTILITIES ARE BUNDLED IN THE RENT. THEN THAT PAYMENT IS PAID DIRECTLY TO THE LANDLORD AT THE TIME THAT THE TENANT PAYMENT IS PROCESSED. IF THE UTILITIES ARE SEPARATED AND THE PAYMENTS ARE GOING TO BE- UTILITY PROVIDER. WINDOWS ARE- CARVED OUT AND THEN WE WORK THROUGH OUR PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM FOR FIRST THROUGH THE PROGRAM WE PAINT RENTAL ARREARS AND RENTAL PERSPECTIVE AND THEN UTILITY PAYMENTS. THAT THOSE WOULD BE CAPTURED WHEN THE APPLICANT POINT AN APPLICATION AND THEN PROPPED UP AS WE. GO THROUGH THE PRIORITIZATION WITHIN THE PROGRAM. YEAH JUST A FOLLOW UP TEST I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT- WERE NOT. THAT WE CAN GET THAT THE RESIDENTS CAN GET THAT SUPPORT. BY GOING TO ONE PLACE AND NOT WORRYING ABOUT. THE DIFFERENT PLACES BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE JUST THE UTILITY IT MIGHT BE CONNECTED. IF THEY DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE DETAILS OF THAT CAN THEY JUST GO TO ONE PLACE AND THAT WOULD BE PUT ALL THAT INFORMATION. AND SUPPORT WOULD BE PROVIDED. YES SENATOR THAT THAT IS THAT IS CORRECT WHEN THEY GO INTO THE APPLICATION PORTAL AND THEY'LL BE WALK THROUGH ALL OF THAT BACK. AND WITH OUR RECENT APPLICATION UPDATE AND WE HAVE WORKED TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS AND MAKE IT A MUCH CLEARER SO THAT THEY CAN SEE AND ULTIMATELY A CHECKLIST ON WITHIN THE APPLICATION OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. AND THEN WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS YOUR PLAN FOR THE FUN. AND WE'VE ALSO DONE QUITE A BIT OF TRAINING WITH OUR LOCAL NETWORK PARTNERS OUR CALL CENTER CENTER KEEP MANAGEMENT. TO HELP APPLICANTS- UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AND MAKE. SURE THE BABY- REQUEST ALL OF THEM. THANK YOU. SENATOR OCHO BOOK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST A QUICK QUESTION AS FAR AS THE- THE TIME IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY DO THE DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUNDS- FOR THE LANDLORDS OR FOR THE FOR THE TENANTS WHAT. ARE WE LOOKING AT THIS TIME. STAFF DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER I'M SORRY. WHEN WE TAKE THAT QUESTION OR YES. I'M SORRY I'M SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION. ABSOLUTELY BUT MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH IS IT YOU FOLKS ARE REIMBURSING ALRIGHT THEY REIMBURSEMENT FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED TOWARDS OUR COOKING GRANTED TO THE EITHER EITHER THE TENANT OR THE LANDLORD. THANK YOU FOR READING AND- SO THE TIME FRAME VERY A LITTLE BIT DEPENDING ON THE PRIORITIZATION OF THE TENANT. AND SO IT'S APPLICATION COMES INTO OUR PRODUCTS AND REUSING NEEDS EXISTING STATE LAW TO PRIORITIZE BASED OFF OF THEIR AREA MEDIAN INCOME FIRST AND THEY'RE AND- THEY'RE AT IT RIGHT. TO PUT THEIR ATTENTION BELOW 50% AM I OR AT HIGH RISK OF INFECTION- SECONDLY IF THERE WITH AN AGE RESTRICTION THAT IS HIGHER AND HIGHER DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT FROM KOBE. AND THEN THIRD ANY- ANY ELIGIBLE TENANTS THAT ANYBODY WHO IS UNDER EIGHTY PERCENT. MEDIAN INCOME FOR THE STATE- SO ESSENTIALLY WHEN SOMEBODY SMITH AN APPLICATION- ON OUR CASE MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL THEN DRAW DOWN FROM THAT APPLICATION POOL- BASED OFF OF THE PRIORITIZATION. ANSWER SOMEBODY'S IN A PRIORITY ONE OR PRIORITY QUEUE THEN THEY CAN BE QUITE QUICKLY IF THEIR PRIORITY THREE THEN THE TIME FRAME WILL TAKE. A LITTLE BIT LONGER- WHAT. WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT FOR LAST MONTH TO IS REALLY. THE APPLE- SO THAT IT IS. EASIER AND FASTER AN APPLICANT TO BE ABLE TO- COMPLETE INFORMATION ON BUT THAT ALSO SO THAT OUR CASE MANAGERS ABLE TO REVIEW THE APPLICATIONS AND THE ACTUAL PROCESS. AND ONCE WE GET THROUGH THE CURRENT BACKLOG ARTICLE WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT PROCESS. I'M JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS. FROM SUBMISSION TO PAYMENT. SIR BOTH GO AHEAD MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU. SO JUST FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES SO WHAT IS THE CURRENT TIME FRAME RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS A REIMBURSEMENT GOES AND I KNOW YOU ARE MOVING FORWARD YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WHAT IS THE CURRENT- TIME FRAME THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT REIMBURSEMENT. THANK YOU IT DOES VERY DEPENDING ON ON THE APPLICATION WE HAVE PROPER COMMENT QUICKLY A FEW WEEKS. AND THEN OTHERS HAVE TAKEN LONGER AND WE'RE CALLING THE FEATURED APPLICATION. ON BECAUSE THEY AND THEY DO HAVE THAT THERE IN THE LONGER PRIORITIZATION- IN THAT CASE WE DO HAVE APPLICATIONS THAT WERE SUBMITTED- AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT PROCESS THAT ARE STILL WAITING UNTIL WE GET INTO THAT. THEIR THEIR PRIOR EDUCATION. IF I IF I MIGHT JUST ADD. TO THAT- ALSO SENATOR- THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME VARYING TIME FRAMES ALSO BASED ON. A WHAT PART OF THE STATE BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT. PROGRAMS WHAT LATEST DESCRIBING STATES- STATES PROGRAM- WHICH SERVES ALL COMMUNITIES ALL JURISDICTIONS THAT WERE. COUNTIES THAT WERE UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION SIZE AND ANY ABOVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OPTED INTO OUR PROGRAM. THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS HOWEVER THAT ELECTED TO RUN THEIR OWN PROGRAMS LOCALLY LARGER JURISDICTIONS AND- THEY HAVE. YOU KNOW THEY'RE PROCESSING ADMINISTERING THEIR OWN PROGRAMS LOCALLY AND- SO THE TIME FRAMES WHEN SPEAKING TO ARE THE ONES THAT ARE UNDER OUR CONTROL. AT THE STATE HERE. ARE H. C. D. NH PROGRAM. RIGHT BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT I HAVE A QUESTION- THE FIRST COMMENT I AM VERY PLEASED THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO COVER. A 100% OF RENT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT AND ADDITIONALLY IT IS PERSPECTIVE SO THAT IT'S NOT ONLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT YOU HAD NOT PAID YOUR RENT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE. WHO BECAUSE OF THE FEAR. OF LOSING A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS HAVE. BEEN PAYING THEIR RENT HOWEVER THEY MAY BE IN GREAT DEBT OR OTHERWISE A REALLY- PUT THEMSELVES IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION. IN ORDER TO MEET THAT. AND COULD BE IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY'RE FACING OTHER. INTERESTING CONSEQUENCES FOR NON PAYMENT OF OTHER THINGS SO IF THEY- AND PROSPECTIVELY CAN GET SOME RENT RELIEF THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR OTHER DEBTS- THE QUESTION I HAVE THOUGH IS. ON THE INCOME QUALIFICATIONS SOME OF OUR INCOME QUALIFICATION PROGRAMS FACTOR UNEMPLOYMENT INCOME SOME DO NOT. DOES THIS PROGRAM A FACTOR ONCE UNEMPLOYMENT INCOME. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR AND I BELIEVE IT DOES NOT. SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT. KATE MIDDLETON GO AHEAD KEEP GOING.

CAN YOU TELL ME JUST BASED ON WHAT THE FORMULA IS REALLY QUICK WITH THE FORMULA WILL BE- CALCULATED ON. I'M YESTERDAY FORMULA FOR AREA MEDIAN INCOME IS LOOKING AT AND THE NUMBER OF I'M- LOOKING AT YOUR YOUR YOUR INCOME AND THEN IT'S ALSO BEARING IN MIND THE NUMBER OF AND HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS THAT- FALL UNDER THAT INCOME. AND THEN IT IS CALCULATED AS THE RELATION TO YOU AND THE COUNTY THAT YOU'RE LOCATED IN. AND TO EACH JURISDICTION HAS A DIFFERENT AREA MEDIAN INCOME- AND THEN EACH HOUSEHOLD WILL NEED TO CALCULATE BASED OFF OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS TO SEE WHERE THEY FALL WITHIN RELATE TO THAT. ABOVE OR BELOW 80% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS COMPLEX AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE WITHIN THE PROGRAM IF WE BUILT AN EIGHT. AM MY CALCULATOR PULLED INTO THE APPLICATION AND BALL AND INTO OUR ELIGIBILITY QUIZ ON THE HAPPINESS I THANK. TO BE ABLE TO HELP- AND- BOTH HOUSEHOLDS LANDLORD TENANT AND THAT YOU'RE HELPING AT THE PEOPLE IN COMPLETING YOUR APPLICATION. AND MAKE THAT CALCULATION. THANK YOU IS THE M. EDT.
