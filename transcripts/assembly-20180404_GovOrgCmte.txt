OKAY THE CONSENT CONNECT COUNTERS BEEN ADOPTED AND AT THIS POINT MEMBERS WILL MOVE TO ITEM ONE ON THE AGENDA AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. ASSEMBLY. MEMBER LONG PLEASE. APPROACH AND OUR PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS I AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN REQUIRES BOTH STATE AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EMERGENCY SERVICES COMMUNICATION TO INCLUDE CLEAR. TRANSLATION FOR THE MOST COMMONLY SPOKEN LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH IN IMPACTED COUNTY OR COUNTIES. WITH FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS OVER THE AGES. I'M SORRY ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIVE SPEAKING A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME IT'S VITAL THAT EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS ARE MADE AVAILABLE IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THE KALAYEH S. OFFICE FOR AXIS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING THE EMERGENCY CONCERNS A POPULATIONS WITH. AXIS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS BEFORE DURING AND AFTER A DISASTER DESPITE THE FACT THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY ARE INCLUDED IN ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEED CONSIDERATIONS. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS ARE STILL NOT REQUIRED TO BE AMENABLE IN NINE WHICH IS OTHER THAN ENGLISH. AS. COMMUNITIES IN DISTRICTS EXPERIENCE. FIRST HAND BY THE IT BY THE IMPACT OF EXCLUSIVE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION DURING THE DEVASTATING THOMAS FIRE. WHICH BURNED OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND ACRES IN FORCE OVER A HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND RESIDENTS TO EVACUATE. DURING THE INITIAL DAYS THE THOMAS FIRE THERE WERE UNDERSTANDABLE COMMUNICATION GAPS. BUT SCHEDULED SPANISH EMERGENCY UPDATES TOOK OVER A WEEK TO BE PROVIDED FROM THE DATE OF THE FIRE INITIALLY STARTED THIS LEFT MANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS FEELING AND SAFE AND UNSURE WHETHER TO EVACUATE. THE COMMUNICATION NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT SPEAK LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH ARE NOT BEING SUFFICIENTLY INCORPORATED INTO EMERGENCY PLAN. THIS OVERSIGHT PLACES THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING FIRST RESPONDERS AT RESTORING TIMES WHEN EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION IS MOST NEEDED. I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY TO INDIVIDUALS AT WHO WILL TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL JENNA BE FLOOR IS HARO AND FROM THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF MY* AND ALSO AGAIN UROS WITH THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA MOVE THE BILL. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND. MANY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE ALSO BE HELPED THE CITY'S GENERAL TO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE EARLY HOURS AND DAYS AND WEEKS THE TUBS FIRE. WAS OUR THAT WE HAD A NUMBER OF STAFF AND FOLKS IN SANTA ROSA WE'RE WORKING TO TRANSLATE EMERGENCY% COMMUNICATIONS MESSAGES. WE GOT TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM OH YES BUT ONE OF THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE COMMUNICATION ALPINE TIME INTO. IN A MANNER WHICH EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY IN ALL LANGUAGES ARE GETTING THE MESSAGE THAT THEY NEED WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP ON THE SPELL AND THEREFORE WE ASK FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY. FURTHER TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE A TESTIMONY OPPOSITION. MARY CHRIS AT THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE SPELL. THANK YOU. SEEING NO MORE TESTIMONIAL RAY BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. A BIG. THANK YOU MISS LAMONT ON PRE* WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE COMING FROM. I DISTRICT THAT HAS A LOT OF BILINGUAL ACTIVITIES I IT IT MEANS A LOT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE TO AS. SOME QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT IS THE MATRIX HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ESTABLISH. IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES THE PREDOMINANT LANGUAGE. BECAUSE IN MANY CASES THAT COULD BE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE OR THE THIRD LANGUAGE THEREFORE ALL IN NOTICES WOULD GO OUT AND. HOW WE GONNA HANDLE? THE COMBINED EFFORTS SO WHAT WOULD BE THAT MATRIX FOR THAT I GOT SEVERAL QUESTIONS OKAY SO WELL ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD. ENGLISH WILL ALWAYS BE THAT WERE THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND SO THIS IS IN ADDITION TO ENGLISH AND SO THAT FORTY FOUR PERCENT NUMBER WE HAVE ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE TWENTY TEN. US CENSUS AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE KNOW ALL OF THE COUNTIES HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND WE ALSO HAD TO HAVE AN IDEA THAT WE WILL TAKE AYE IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. AYE TODAY WILL TAKE TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH IS A PREPARATION THAT IT SHOULD BE EITHER TRANSLATION AND OR. ON A LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT BECAUSE WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA MAY HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES WHERE. I YOU KNOW OF SPANISH MAY BE ONE OF THEM BUT IT'S UP THERE WITH A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. AND SO THEY MAY NEED TO HAVE A DIFFERENT RESPONSE OF THE IDEA IT IS REALLY THAT THE COUNTIES WILL HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO IDENTIFY WHETHER A SIMPLE TRANSLATION ON EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO OR. THEY WILL INCLUDE AND LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT AS PART OF THEIR EMERGENCY PLAN AND THAT LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT WILL HAVE WHATEVER SPECIFIC NEED GAMINI IDENTIFY FOR EXACT COUNT. SO HELP WALK US THROUGH. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TWENTY TEN CENTS IS WE'RE JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM AND WHEN HE TWENTY. CENSUS AND THAT WILL BE. HOW FOR REFERENCES BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WERE VERY CLOSE I HAD? ARE WE GONNA WANNA. DO THIS TWICE. BASING IT OFF OF THE TWENTY TEN AND THEN. BUT AGAIN HAVE TO REALLY CHANGE THINGS AND GO TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SINCE THIS YEAH I WOULD LOVE FOR THERE TO BE NO MORE NATURAL DISASTERS ON BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT CENSUS THAT WOULD BE MY DREAM. ON BUT HAVING LIVED THIS I THINK THAT THERE IS AN URGENCY TO DO SOMETHING NOW AND THESE EMERGENCY PLANS ARE SOMETHING THAT COUNTIES ACTUALLY. HAVE TO CONDUCT AN UPDATE ON A REGULAR BASIS SO THIS WOULD BE ONE MORE ELEMENT THAT THEY WOULD INCLUDE IN THAT EMERGENCY PLAN TO IDENTIFY HOW THEY WILL GET THAT INFORMATION OUT BUT YES. ON THAT THE PLAN IS TO DO IT RIGHT AWAY BUT IN ADDITION ON UPDATE THAT INFORMATION THAT COUNTIES WILL GENERALLY UPDATE ALL OF THEIR COUNTY INFORMATION TO INCLUDE THE TWENTY. FIVE TWENTY CENSUS SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO THE COUNTY BY COUNTY. BECAUSE IN SOME CASES DURING THE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS TRAILS AND HAVING WRITTEN SOME OF THOSE MIDDLE PART OF IT. I KNOW THAT IN SOME CASES WE HAVE TO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT. THE LOCAL COUNTY CAN'T TAKE CARE OF ITSELF THERE FOR ALL SYSTEMS ARE DOWN WHIP RUN THE NEXT. NEIGHBORING COUNTY IN A NEIGHBORING COUNTY MAY NOT HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S DESIGNED TO THE SAME LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES BECAUSE IT'S. DENNIS MODELING HUMAN HASN'T COME OUT THAT WAY. HOW ARE WE GONNA REMEDY THAT ANY CASE THAT FAILS AS WELL THEN THERE'S THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH HAS THE THIRD OVERLAY IN THE SYSTEM? AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE ANY OF THIS SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO COORDINATE THAT NOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR. RIGHT IN AND AND AND ACTUALLY I WILL SAY THAT IN THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THE DO SO WHAT WE LEARNED WITH THE THOMAS FIRE AND THE DEGREE FLOWS. IS THAT THE THE CHALLENGE WAS NOT THAT WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY THAT THIS THAT CRITICAL TRANSLATED LANGUAGE WAS NEEDED IT WAS THAT IT WASN'T PART OF THE COORDINATION SO THIS BILL WOULD FORCE IT TO BE PART OF THE COORDINATION. AND THE EVERY COUNTY WOULD HAVE AND I THINK THAT IF THE COUNTY DOES HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER COUNTY THAT WILL ALSO BE PART OF THE CONSIDERATION WHAT WHAT SERVICES. I DO THE OTHER COUNTIES HAVE WHAT IS THEIR PLAN HAVE ON IT FROM WORKING IT KIND OF ON THE GROUND WITH FOLKS I REALIZED. THAT IT WAS RELEASED A SIMPLE KIND OF JUST LET'S GET THIS INFORMATION OUT SO I REMEMBER. WHEN CAL FIRE STARTED GIVING OUT THE INFORMATION THE SCHEDULED WEEKLY SIX O'CLOCK NEWS. ONLINE CONFERENCES IN SPANISH BECAUSE THEY DID HAVE SOMEONE WHO COULD SPEAK SPANISH BUT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT AND THAT BECAME REALLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE IN THE MOMENT. OF NEED OF EVACUATIONS AYE MEANS WRONG. WHAT WHEN YOU TRANSLATE FOR EXAMPLE? ST THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TRANSLATE IT STREET THERE IS NOTHING WHAT THE TRANSLATED NAME AND SO WE REALIZED IT WAS CREATING MORE OF A PROBLEM AND IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE FOR EVERYONE. SO I THINK THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TRANSLATE ALL THE INFORMATION IF THERE IS IF THE HIGHEST DOESN'T WORK FOR A COUNTY THEN YOU DUELING WITH YOU. ON THIS WILL BE THE AMENDMENT WE TAKE TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE SHOULD THIS MOVE FORWARD THEN YOU WOULD YOU A LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT AND THAT LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT WOULD CLEARLY PROVIDE THE STEP BY STEP OF WHAT BACK COUNTY NEEDS TO DO. TO RESPOND TO ALL OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND AND THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT THERE'S AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE TAKING OF ARE PRESENTING. AND THAT'S WHAT THE NEXT STEP SO YOU KNOW AS I SAID WHEN I STARTED OUT. I LIKE WHAT I'M SEEING AND I COULD FEEL IT YOU KNOW THIS BILL IN ANOTHER BILL ARE A COUPLE OF BILLS I HAVE TO. NOT VOTE ON TODAY BECAUSE OFF HERE AGAIN IN THE. I SIMPLY IDEA APPROPRIATIONS. CITED EQUATION SO I CAN'T. REALLY. GET AHEAD OF MYSELF I SOMETIMES. ANYWAY I COULD I WOULD RECOMMEND A SUPPORT FOR THIS ON THE RIGHT NOW TODAY I'M JUST GOING TO. ANON VOTE NOT LEAVE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF. SUPPORT IT AS IT MOVES FOR IT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY QUESTIONS. MS I WEAR CURRY. THANK YOU FOR BEING THIS FOR I AM GLAD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS ITEM. WE LEARNED OUR LESSON FIRST AND I FIRST THING YOU DID IS PICKED UP THE PHONE BILL MONIQUE THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE THING WE GOTTA DO IS MAKE SURE THE TRANSLATIONS ARE BECAUSE THE FIRST THING THE PEOPLE WERE VERY CRITICAL OF. OF BUT ASSUMING THE WE WERE BEING RESPONSIVE WHICH WAS SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH. NEVERTHELESS IS THAT I THINK THIS IS GOOD LEGISLATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING UP FOR. AND I DO THINK YOU BECAUSE WITHIN THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF THE EMERGENCY AND ENTER AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY YOU DID CALL AND YOU SAID EXACTLY THIS WOULD HAPPEN AND IT DID SO I THINK YOU FOR THAT. OKAY DO EVERY OTHER OUR QUESTION MEMBERS. SEEING NONE WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND. THIS IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL GRAY AYE GRAY AYE BIGELOW.

WELCOME SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THE PROTECT OUR HOMES PILOT PROGRAM OULD ALLEVIATE HARDSHIP ON STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS WHO MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN BASIC NEEDS AND HOME SECURITY. SAFETY OF ONE'S OWN HOME SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF THOSE COMPETING NEEDS. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE THREE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY FOR THE PROTECT OUR HOMES PILOT PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WHO QUALIFY FOR THE EITC THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND MERCED AND SAMMY DINO COUNTIES. WITH GRANTS UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IN ORDER TO PURCHASE QUALIFYING HOME SECURITY EQUIPMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OVER A MILLION PROPERTY CRIMES WERE COMMITTED. STUDIES SHOW THAT BURGLARIES OCCUR MOST COMMONLY AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT LEAVING RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO BURGLARY. ONE STUDY FOUND THAT EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF CONVICTED BURGLARS WOULD ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE IF A SECURITY SYSTEM WAS PRESIDENT PRIOR TO ATTEMPTING A BURGLARY. ONCE FOUND TO BE DEFENSELESS THIRTY PERCENT OF POLLED CONVICTED BURGLARS RE ENTERED A HOMER BUILT THING THEY PREVIOUSLY BURGLARIZED. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THE SECURITY SYSTEMS COST UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FORCING RESIDENTS LIVING NEAR THE POVERTY LINE TO MAKE THE CHOICE BETWEEN HOME SAFETY. AND OTHER BASIC NEEDS. AND MERCED AND SAMMY DINO COUNTIES BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION. SECOND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. OKAY DO WE HAVE ANY. TESTIMONY. IN SUPPORT. SEEING THAT ANY TESTIMONY NOT POSITION. SEEING NONE AND QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS MISTER SOLACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY DO SEE A NEED FOR THIS SPECIALLY IN THOSE AREAS OF HIGH CRIME. PLACES THAT HAVE DOUBLE DIGIT UNEMPLOYMENT AND AYE DID SEE THE. SAY THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MET AMENDMENTS OF WAS JUST WANTED TO ASK IF YOU TO ACCEPT ANOTHER AMENDMENT TO CLERK CURRENT IN KINGS COUNTY. A I I AM ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE IDEA OF INCLUDING KINGS COUNTY ABSOLUTELY CURRENT KINGS COUNTY SO HE'LL DISCUSS THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU. WITHOUT ALL SUPPORT THE MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHICH CURRENTLY. BECAUSE CHAIRMAN. IT THANK YOU. SOME NEVER SIGNED WITH FOR THE LEGISLATURE I WAS CURES AND SO WERE STABBED TO PROGRAMS THAT'S THE REASON FOR A. PILOT RIGHT YOU. TO TEST OUT THE COP CONCEPT CHAU GOES RIGHT. AND YOU HAVE BUSY PART OF A WIDE ARRAY OF SECURITY. OPTIONS I MEAN. WHEN I READ THIS ARE THINKING OF A SECURITY SYSTEM PROBABLY ACQUIRING ONE WOULD THAT ALSO BE INCLUSIVE OF THE MONTHLY SERVICE THAT. WOULD HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH THAT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM YES OKAY IN THE SECURITY FENCE IN WHAT IS THAT ME IS THERE. KEEN TO FIND OUT WHAT SPECIFICALLY FROM SO SECURITY FENCING WOULD BE DEFINED AS THE SECURITY DOORS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE FRONT OF PEOPLE'S HOMES SURE AND THEN ALSO SOME OF THE PERIMETER FENCING. FROM LIKE DOES IT HAVE TO ME IS LIKE IN CONVENTIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD FENCER IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING MUST. THIS MAY SEEM A LITTLE BIT OF A PICKY BUT ANY ITEM I BARB WIRE ME WHAT WHAT MAKES A SECURITY FENCE OR JUST A REGULAR IT WOULD IT WOULD BE A TRADITIONAL FANS BUT PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES ON ON THE PERIMETER. BUT THE PRIMARY WE'RE LOOKING AT IS WHEN YOU SEE THOSE. SECURITY DOORS ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THOSE WHERE YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE HOW PEOPLE CAN SEE OUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT AND THEN IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL SECURITY NEEDED LET'S SAY THEY HAVE. AREA. HAVE EASY PENETRATION AT THEIR HOME. OKAY SO WE'RE NOW LOOKING LIKE A TRADITIONAL LIKE PICKET FENCE OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE THAT ISN'T THE INTENTION OF IT NOR IS IT TO THE EXTENT OF OF. YOU KNOW CONCERTINA WIRE ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE. AND. OKAY THE. WAS THAT WITH THE PILOT COUNTIES THAT WERE SELECTED IS THERE ANY COULDN'T DATA THAT SORT OF BACKS UP THOSE SELECTIONS AND YES WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IS THAT OUR CRIME RATES OF THE POPULATION AND THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF E. I. T. C.. AND ALSO WAS RESPECTED TO THE. LOCATIONS ONE WAS IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ONCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE TRYING TO SPREAD THAT OUT OKAY SIR MOVING THE GEOGRAPHIC. SOUTHERN CENTRAL KABUL IN IT BUT MY FAMILIES HOW NO FOR EXAMPLE TARANTINO HAS A SEVENTEEN PERCENT. EITC ABRADE AND ALSO HAS. SIMILAR POVERTY AND CRIME RATES AND THEN MERCED COUNTY WAS UP TO TWENTY PERCENT. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WHICH WHICH COUNTIES HAD THE HIGHEST PROPENSITY OF OF LOW INCOME AND ALSO EITC COMPLIANT AND ALSO HAD HIGH CRIME SO WE'RE COMPARING THOSE TWO ARE THESE THE TWO BIGGEST AND THOSE WERE THE ONES THAT THAT DREW OUR ATTENTION TO BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT THEY'RE. THE TWO BIGGEST WHEN WE LOOK AT LA COUNTY AND SOME OF THE OTHER SISTER JESSA EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE COUNTIES BUT THESE TWO WOULD FIT WITHIN THE PARAMETERS WERE LOOKING FOR THE PILOT. I IMAGINE YOU HAVE NO OTHER MEMBERS ASKED TO BE INCLUDED. IN IN THAT OF COURSE AFFECTS COST RIGHT WELL A COULD RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A THREE MILLION DOLLAR. BASIC FOR THE FOR THE PILOT PROGRAM AND PUT A FIVE YEAR SUNSET ON THAT SO WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH. IT'S MAY WE WILL BE WORKING WITH. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY TO PUT TOGETHER THE PROGRAM ON HOW THEY WOULD AND THE INDIVIDUALS WOULD APPLY AND HOW THE MONEY WOULD BE DISPERSED.

SALAS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT LAST YEAR I DON'T THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A PERCENT OR IN SUPPORT. WE DO THANK YOU. YOU GOT IT. ROBERT JACOBSON OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON PROBLEM GAMBLING. WE ARE I NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO WERE AFFECTED BY GAMBLING ADDICTION AND TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS. OUT. WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWENTY FOUR A PARTICULARLY FOR THE INCREASED FUNDING IT REPRESENTS FOR THE OFFICE OF PROBLEM GAMBLING. GAMBLING ADDICTION AFFECTS ABOUT THREE AND A HALF PERCENT OF ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS MORE THAN A MILLION ADULTS. IMPACTS CAN HAVE CONSEQUENCES ON FINANCIAL PHYSICAL MENTAL HEALTH. DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES TO THE FAMILY THE OFFICE OF PROBLEM GAMBLING IS CURRENTLY THE PRIMARY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. THAT SERVES THOSE INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEIR CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS OF ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. ALLOW THEM TO MARKET TO FOUR OUT OF SIX GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITHOUT AN INCREASE THEY ARE UNABLE TO EXPAND THOSE FINAL TWO REGIONS. OPG IS FUNDING OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE. BUT AS A PER CAPITA BASIS IS THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA GROWERS. IT'S ACTUALLY DECREASED BY ABOUT FOUR PERCENT. CURRENT FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT TWENTY TWO PER TWENTY TWO CENTS PER CAPITA. WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE RATE OF THIRTY SEVEN CENTS PER CAPITA. THAT REPRESENTS AN UNWEIGHTED NATIONAL AVERAGE OF THE THIRTY NINE STATES THAT PROVIDE PUBLIC FUNDING. THEY DON'T THAT PRESENTATION SHE IS VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. WILLING TO. AND HAPPENS. ENTER GOVERNOR BEHALF THE MORONGO BAND OF MISSION INDIANS WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A REASONABLE WAY TO PROVIDE EQUITY AND GET MORE MONEY INTO THE OFF THE PROBLEM GAMBLING. WE SUPPORT. HILL ARE NOT TAKING TIME HERE FOR THE BROWN ABANDON MISSION INDIANS AND WE ALSO SUPPORT AND ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO UPGRADE THE PRETTY PALTRY AMOUNTS THAT THE LOTTERY HAS BEEN PROVIDING FOR PROBLEM GAMBLING SO FAR. SO THANK YOU FOR THEM. FOLLOW TREAT ON BEHALF OF THE COLUSA INTO CHINA TRIBES IN FULLER WAS TOO NICE. EVERYBODY SHOULD THAT'S HAS GAMING SHOULD BE PAIN AND THAT THIS FINE AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT. SHAWN FLANAGAN ON BEHALF OF CHIU MASINISSA QUAN TRIBE AND STRONG SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NO OPPOSITION QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. KILEY. I REFERENCE TO PRESS THIS BILL I AM SEEMS FINE TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR THIS OFFICE AND. I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE THE LOTTERIES ADVERTISING PRACTICES HAVE GOTTEN QUITE AGGRESSIVE. FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE THIS OUT PLAY AT THE PUMP FEATURE WHERE WHEN YOU GO TO PUMP YOUR GAS YOU'RE ASKED WHAT HE WON BY AUDREY TICKET. AND YET YOU CAN'T PROCEED BUYER GAS UNTIL YOU SAY NOW I WANT THAT TOGETHER AYE YES I WANT YOU TO KNOW I DON'T. DO YOU KNOW IF HE'S OFFICES PROBLEM GAMBLING HAS. INVESTIGATED AT ALL WHETHER SOME OF THE LOTTERY'S ADVERTISING PRACTICES ARE ITSELF CONTRIBUTING THE PROBLEM. SURE. WHILE I DO NOT REPRESENT THE OFF THE PROBLEM GAMBLING. I DO KNOW THAT OPG IS AVAILABLE TO CONSULT WITH THE LOTTERY AND THAT THROUGH OUR HELPLINE AND VARIOUS OTHER PROGRAMS WE DO COLLECT DATA AS TO HOW NEW PROGRAMS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY OPG DOES NOT HAVE ANY REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO HAVE ANY IMPACT OVER LOTTERIES ADVERTISING PRACTICE. SO WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTIGATING THE THEY WOULDN'T BE THE AGENCY THAT COULD ACTUALLY INITIATE OR PURSUE AN INVESTIGATION. OKAY Y. THING IT'S ON WORTH LOOKING INTO BECAUSE IF WE'RE USING THESE PRACTICES WHICH I THINK ARE. YOU KNOW VERY AGGRESSIVE TO REQUIRE SOMEONE FOR THE BAG LAST SAY NO I DON'T WANT A LOTTERY TICKET I MEAN I'M NOT REQUIRED TO. I REFUSE ANY OTHER PRODUCT I GUESS MAYBE A CAR WASH BEFORE I I GET MY GAS. SILVER USING THIS IS A WAY TO KINDA. HOOK PEOPLE IN THE REASON CARD THAT REVENUE TO PUT IN THE PROBLEM OF. TO THE OFFICE OF PROBLEM GAMBLING IT SEEMS SOMEWHAT SELF DEFEATING SO I. YOU KNOW I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THE LOTTERY TO TO EXAMINE SOME OF ITS OWN PRACTICES IN THAT RESPECT FOR LITERALLY MAKES A PRIORITY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF MR ACOSTA. BOB THANK YOU QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. BUT AS FAR AS I COULD TELL THE. THE SOURCES IT REALLY SPECIFY LIKE WHERE THIS IS BECAUSE OUT OF THIS COMING OUT OF THE. LOTTERY PROCEEDS TO THE WINNERS THIS IS COMING OUT. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE DON'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL FUNDING CAN CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT A BIT. OPENED YEARS THREE MAIN SOURCES OF FUNDING TRAVELS HERE CARD ROOMS LOTTERY. THIS ACCOUNTS FOR. ROUGHLY. LISTA HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS INTO. THE OFFICE PROBLEM GAMBLING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF OPG IS ANNUAL BUDGET WERE CUT CALIFORNIA'S TRIBAL CONSENT CASINOS CONTRIBUTED NINETY SIX PERCENT. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY. WERE MOVING SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES HERE. IN THE FRONT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER YET UNRESOLVED ISSUES. THE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED CERTAINLY WE NEED TO AYE INQUIRES TO WHERE MR KILEY BUYS GAS. AND. ONE PROBLEM CAR WASH IN IN SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS OF THIS COMMITTEE ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. AND SO WITH SOME SERIOUS BUTTON NOW AND LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE. SO SO WHY I APPRECIATE THAT SO TIGHTLY I DIDN'T BEGIN. THEN A SO THE ANSWER LOOK AROUND OKAY I'M IN THIS BOOK COULD BE. FLUSHED OUT BUT NOT IN THE SCOPE OF THE BILL BUT YEAH SOMETHING WE CAN ENTERTAIN THREE OKAY WELL I I'M NOT I'M ASKING FOR AN AMENDMENTS A SURLY BUT WHAT I AM ASKING FOR IS IS THAT IDENTIFY NIGHT IS CONCERNED THAT IT'S COMING OUT OF SCHOOL SO.

YES THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE LIKE A HOLIDAY. FOURTEEN OTHER STATES PORTA RICO. INCLUDED AS A LIKE ME* SO IS THERE ANY. ANALYSIS OF WHETHER THIS INCREASED TURN ON THE STATE'S OF THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT THIS POINT. THAT I HAD BEEN PRESENTED WITH THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT. HAVING SAID THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC. ANECDOTAL A CONVERSATIONS WITH RESPECT TO LOWERING THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY WHICH IS THAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT EXIST WITH RESPECT TO PARTICIPATION. AFTER ELECTION. AND. MUCH OF THAT COULD BE ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LIFE ISSUES WHETHER IT BE WORKING SCHOOL YOU GET YOUR KIDS. OTHER SUCH THANK I UNDERSTAND THAT ARGUMENT WOULD BE A FOURTEEN STATES THAT HAVE DONE THIS AND HASN'T TURNOUT WHY DO YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA INCREASE TURN UP AND HERE. I THINK IT'S IN THE SPIRIT OF LOWERING THE BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION RIGHT BUT IF YOU'RE A CLEAR FOURTEEN STATES OF DOT AND HOUSING INCREASE TURNOUT THE WHITE AND IT'S GOOD INCREASE TURNOUT WE HAVEN'T DONE A AYE. WELL LET'S SAY THAT THE. WITH RESPECT TO A PEW RESEARCH CENTER. HOW WOULD? THEY DID HIGHLIGHT THAT WORK OR SCHOOL ALWAYS THE NUMBER ONE FACTOR WITH RESPECT TO NON PARTICIPATION OPENS IN A WAY THAT WAS TRUE OF THE FOURTEEN STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS AND IT INCREASE TURNOUT SLIDING CAN INCREASE TURNOUT HERE WHAT IT AND I JUST I JUST ANSWER YOUR. QUESTION. I DON'T THINK YOU THAT. YEAH I JUST I JUST ENTER QUITE ABOUT LOWERING THE BARRIERS. OKAY. BUT I GUESS THOSE WERE NOT BARRIERS IN THE STATE THAT VOTED ON THIS COULD HAVE BEEN. ALRIGHT SECOND QUESTION HOW DOES JUDGE WHETHER MY FIRST QUESTION WAS ANSWERED. SO WHAT YOU LEVEL TO SAY. I SAID I'LL LET OTHERS JUDGE WITH MY FIRST QUESTION WAS ANSWERED AYE BUT IF THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S INCREASE TURNOUT IN THAT STATE THAT BE INTERESTING TO SEE. SO CALIFORNIA'S BEEN MOVING TO THIS. VOTE CENTER MODEL WHERE I YOU KNOW YOU GET MORE TIME TO VOTE NOW AND SO WITH I SORT OF ELONGATING THE. TIME TO VOTE WHY IS NOW THE TIME TO GIVE US THIS ONE.

LAST TIME THIS TIME EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT WE WANT TO LOWER BARRIERS TO ENTRY BUT IF IT IS YOUR OBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCE IN CONCLUSION THAT WE WANT TO MAKE IT HARDER. THEN THAT'S YOUR PROPERTY.

AS WE TRANSITION OUT TO THE MORE ON MODERN. DAY OF VOTING WHERE WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE POLLING PLACES WILL VOTE BY MAIL AND WILL HAVE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN DAYS TO VOTE. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS BILL? ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THAT AND THE HOLIDAY PROCESS. THURMOND. ABOUT THE TRANSITION OF THAT WHERE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S GOING WITH RECKLESS OR GOING TO WE HAVE IS A SINGLE DAY YES AND ALLOW WHICH EMPLOYERS ARE YOU ARE REQUIRED TO LET THEIR EMPLOYEES OFF. DO GOING VOTE. BUT NOT ALWAYS THAT THAT OCCURRED AND WE WANT TO CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE MORE DEMOCRACY IN THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE HENCE THE REASON WHY WE'RE MOVING. TO MORE BROAD IN ITS STE SCOPE DOT HOW ALLOW ELEVEN DAY PERIOD FOR PEOPLE TO CHOOSE TO VOTE OR GET THEIR BALLOT AND. IN A TIMELY WAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THE VERY OF RESPECT. A DIALOGUE AND CONVERSATION AND RECOGNITION OF THE CURRENT ELECTORAL PROCESS IN THIS. THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF THIS IS NOT ONLY ABOUT ELECTED AS A HOLIDAY WITH RESPECT TO LOWERING THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY BUT ALSO TO CELEBRATE ELECTION AS A HOLIDAY TO USE THIS AS A CIVIC MODEL. AND TALKING ABOUT THIS PROCESS. SO THAT THAT IS OF FULLY ENCOMPASSED IN PART OF THE SPIRIT AT TO HELP ENHANCE THE PROCESS OF ELECTION DAY. AND WE'VE SEEN SUCH TERRIBLE. PARTICIPATION AND WITH RESPECTIVOS. AND WHY NOT USE THIS OUT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND ALL PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO USE THIS SIMILE AS A HOLIDAY. AND TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT.

YOU KNOW IF THIS BILL WERE TO BE SIDE ITS LOS WITH BUDGET REQUEST ACTUALLY OFFSET FOR OUR DISABLED COMMUNITY AND OTHERS LETTER. AFFECTED IT'S WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT WOULD LEAD TO SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH THEM ON AND. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ON WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND ALSO THIS LEGISLATION YES THANK YOU. THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS A FORMER TEACHER. I REALLY. UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO WE DO SPEND A LOT OF TIME. IN THE CLASSROOM TALKING ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HOLIDAYS AND I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD APPROACH TO. TALKING TO KIDS EARLY ARE AS YOUNG AS PRESCHOOL AND. KINDERGARTEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE ABOUT VOTING IN MAKING IT A HOLIDAY WOULD HIGHLIGHT NOT JUST AT THE HOLIDAY FOR ADULTS BUT I THINK THE TEACHING IN THE CLASSROOMS WOULD BE. ABOUT WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT I THINK WE CAN GROW A GENERATION OF KIDS THERE MORE AND MORE I INVESTED IN. PARTICIPATION SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE OF THE. BILL FORWARD AND I. APPLAUD YOU ON YOUR EFFORTS EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE. MISTER GALLAGHER. SO MR LOW I KNOW THIS BILL ABOUT REMOVING BARRIERS S. AS HE TALKED ABOUT AND AND I KNOW. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO VOTE ME EVER SINCE I WAS EIGHTEEN WHEN I FILLED OUT MY REGISTRATION FORM REGISTERED AND YOU KNOW VOTED IN EVERY ELECTION IS SO IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT BUT I KNOW IF WE DON'T LIKE TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND I AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED WITH. THE D. AND THE RIGHT. IT'S IT'S ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY IS AUTOMATED AUTOMATED READ IT AND I'M SO WE TAKE CARE OF THE REGISTRATION. PART PORTION OF IT RIGHT WE. SAME DAY VOTER REGISTERS GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED THIS NEXT ELECTION SO YOU CAN REGISTER ON THE SAME DAY. AND VOTE AND WE ALSO HAVE MANDATORY TIME OFF FROM WORK. YOU CAN REQUEST OF YOUR AND EMPLOYER HAS TO GIVE IT TO YOU. BUT TO GO VOTE REYES AND SO THIS IS JUST ONE MORE. REMOVAL OF VARIOUS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD TO VOTE. AND THE STATE RIGHT. IS THAT THE COMPLETION OF YOUR QUITE YET IT IS. OKAY YET. SO NOW THE HOLIDAY RIGHT BUT WE JUST BROUGHT UP THAT NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE ELEVEN DAYS TO VOTE RIGHT SO WHY NOT JUST MAKE IT ELEVEN DAYS. HOLIDAY. TO MAKE IT REALLY REALLY EASY. MAYBE A MONTH OFF. FOR PEOPLE OF THE IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT AMENDMENT GONNA GET TO YOUR IS AYE AYES. I THINK IF YOU ARE GOING IS THIS LIKE I THINK THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THERE'S. IF THERE IS ANY BARRIER THERE'S NOT AT ALL THE A BUT THIS POINT WITH WITH ALL THE THINGS WE'VE DONE TO MAKE IT VERY EASY FOR SOMEONE TO GOING TO VOTE. TO NOW ADD ANOTHER HOLIDAY AGES. WELL WE ALREADY HAVE HOW MANY HOLIDAYS WE HAVE STATE HOLIDAYS WE HAVE NO. I'M NOT PRIVY TO THAT QUESTION MISTER GALLAGHER THINK GROWTH FOR THIS SIXTEEN I THINK NOW ARE YOU ASK YOUR QUESTION WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ANSWER EXAMINING. SO YOUR QUESTION WAS. SPECTER YOU HIGHLIGHTING. THE CURRENT PROCESSES THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED AS A STATE. TO RECOGNIZE THE SPIRIT OF LOWERING AS MANY BARRIERS TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE. AND IN FACT TO GALLAGHER WE'VE HAD ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS DEVASTATE Y. PROCESS TO WHICH YOU DO HAVE. PREPAID POSTAGE ON DROPS THE BALLOTS IN MY COUNTY YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUT A STAMP ON THE BALLOT. THERE ARE MANY PROPOSALS SO WE WANT TO LOWER A FINANCIAL BARRIER THERE COULD BE TWO. ENSURING THAT ALL VOTES ARE GOING AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE AN OPTION TO DO SO. THAT GOES IN LINE WITH THE SPIRIT OF OR TALK BACK HERE TODAY AS WELL. SO YES THIS IS PART OF A WIDER PACKAGE OF DIRECTION FOR US TO ENCOURAGE AS MUCH CIVIC PARTICIPATION. I'M JUST I'M JUST QUESTION A NECESSITY WHEN WE HAVE ALREADY MADE SO EASY TO LIKE IT'S. THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU COULD NOT THAT YOU CAN TRULY SAY ALL THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO VOTE ON THIS DAY YOU CAN ASK YOUR TIME OFF EMPLOYER. YOU CAN VOTE ANYTIME WITHIN THIS PERIOD YOU CAN REGISTER AND VOTE THE SAME DAY ALL THESE THINGS SO I JUST THAT WHAT I'M GETTING AS A QUESTION THE NECESSITY. AND I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT IF. SHOULD WE STILL GET THIS HOLIDAY PEOPLE IF THEY'VE BEEN WATCHING A LOT OF FAKE NEWS. GETTING THE WRONG INFORMATION ABOUT ELECTIONS WHO WE DON'T WANT THOSE. WHO WOULD WANT THOSE PEOPLE TO VOTE WITH THE WRONG INFORMATION SO KIM SHOULD BE AT? SOME KIND OF PROVISION IN THAT RESPECT WHAT WHAT PROVISIONAL YOU'RE PROPOSING. ARE ARE ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT IF WE IF WHAT IF SOMEBODY'S WATCHING TOO MUCH FAKE NEWS WE KNOW. IN THE IN THE OPINION I GUESS SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE. WHO SHOULD THOSE PEOPLE'S ALSO GET A DAY OFF TO THE THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT BY BILL WAS PROPOSING? LET ME LOSER THAT MIGHT BE A FUTURE BILL. THIS IS ALL THAT WHEN YOU'RE POSING NOT THE NOT THAT I'M OKAY. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT I CAN EXPECT BECAUSE YOU TO HER GIVEN LIKE TOP RECESSION THAT TIME AND THAT WOULD KEEP IT AS TO THE SPECIFICS OF THIS BILL GO AHEAD MOVE I THINK THROUGH THE MEDIA.
