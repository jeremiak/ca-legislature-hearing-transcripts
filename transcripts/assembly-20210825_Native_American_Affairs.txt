TITLE NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS A NOT ADEQUATELY OVERSEEN ITS RETURNS OF NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS. ON THESE LANDS NATIVE AMERICANS ESTABLISHED- BURIAL SITES AND CULTURAL RESOURCES AS TIME PASSED THE SITES HAVE BEEN UNDER CONSTRUCTION DELIVERS SEARCHES OR OTHER CHANGES IN THE LANDING IN ADVERT AND DISCOVERY OF NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS. BEGINNING IN NINETEEN NINETY SPECIFIED INSTITUTIONS WITH THESE REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS WERE REQUIRED TO CREATE INVENTORIES THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH TRIBES AND SUBSEQUENTLY TRIBES COULD SUBMIT CLAIMS TO ANY ITEMS AFFILIATED WITH THEM. THROUGHOUT THE YEARS REPATRIATION HAS BECOME A LENGTHY AND CONFUSING PROCESS NOT ONLY FOR THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO FOR. THOSE THAT HAVE ON THE REMAINS IN THEIR ARCHIVES DESPITE VARIOUS EFFORTS TO RETURN ITEMS TO DRIVE RECLAMATION SUCCESS. HAS BEEN MINIMAL AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME SUCCESS STORIES BUT IT HAS BEEN MINIMAL OVERALL AND AS THE- FIRST CALIFORNIA INDIAN ELECTED THE STATE LEGISLATURE WE FIND THAT IT'S OUR STEWARDSHIP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PRESS THE- THE ENVELOPE TO MAKE SURE THESE REMAINS COME BACK TO THE RIGHTFUL OWNERS. AND THE REMAINS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE GROUND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GIVING BACK TO THE REPATRIATION PROCESS FOR A PROPER REBURIAL WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT PROCESS DOES MOVE FORWARD. THAT'S WHAT THIS HEARING IS ABOUT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET AN UPDATE FROM THE LAST HEARING THAT WE HAD. TO FIND OUT WHERE THE PROGRESS IS IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER. TO GET THESE REMAINS BACK INTO THE RIGHTFUL OWNERS THE TRIBAL PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR A PROPER BURIAL. LAST JUNE THE AUDITOR RELEASED A TROUBLE REPORT. ABOUT THE VAST NUMBER REMAINS HELD BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. IT WAS DURING THAT SAMPLE AUDIT REPORT THAT. CAME TO LIGHT THAT THE UC SYSTEM STILL- HELD OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS. THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE THEY WERE GOING TO GET AN UPDATE FROM SEVERAL SPEAKERS HERE TODAY PENNY RECOMMENDATIONS RANGE FROM THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. ENSURING THAT TRIBAL REPRESENTATION IS INCLUDED. ON APPROPRIATE CAMPUS COMMITTEES. CONSISTENCY AND TIME LINES IN THE REVIEW OF TRAVEL CLAIMS. AND PROVIDING GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT KNOWN MISSING REMAINS AN APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION. AUDITOR HOW WILL PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION SHORTLY ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION. ALSO WITH US IS UC PROVOST. MICHAEL BROWN AND UC BERKELEY VICE CHANCELLOR FOR RESEARCH WILL PRESENT THE UC SYSTEM'S RESPONSE. ALSO WITH US IS TRIBAL CHAIRMAN LEO CISCO. OF THE TOUCHY OKAY TRIBE.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST SENT THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY AND INVITING MEMBERS OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO PARTICIPATE- YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING A LEADING VOICE IN A FORCE ON THIS ISSUE WITH BOTH THE PORTENT. AND AND VERY PERSONAL PERSONAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR SECOND HEARING ON THIS TOPIC- AND SUBSEQUENTLY HERE WE BROUGHT UP THESE ISSUES BEFORE WE'VE EXPRESSED INTEREST AND CONTINUE TO HOLD. HEARINGS UNTIL THE REMAINS OF ANY CALIFORNIA'S ANCESTORS OF THEIR BELONGINGS ARE APPROPRIATELY RETURNED. I CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING MORE PERSONAL. PERSONAL OR MEANINGFUL TO AN INDIVIDUAL OUR COMMUNITY THEN ENSURING THAT ONE'S ANCESTRAL REMAINS. AND BELONGINGS WERE GIVEN THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT THEY RESERVE THAT THEY DESERVE. LOOKING AT THE ONE YEAR STATUS OF THE FIVE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. YOU HAVE TO SAY I AM SADDENED THAT ONLY ONE HAS BEEN FULLY AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CITY'S. EXPLOITATION WHY ONLY ONE OUT OF THE FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS HAS BEEN FULLY. IMPLEMENTED AB CAUTIOUSLY HOPEFUL THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO REASSURE IS TODAY THAT THEY ARE ON THE CORRECT PATH AND THAT ALL FIVE RECOMMENDED. BE IMPLEMENTED. WITH THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S TESTIMONY THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SALAS- ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THOSE IN ATTENDANCE. HAVE ANY ANY COMMENTS THANK YOU SO NOW WE WOULD LIKE TO- CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE HEARING AND OUR FIRST TIME- SPEAKER WILL BE THE STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOWELL AND JIM ADAMS ON THE AUDIT SUPERVISOR TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF THE ITEM WHICH WAS RELEASED LAST YEAR DO WE HAVE THEM ON ZOOM DO WE HAVE THEM READY TO GO. GERMANIST AROUND THE HOUSE AND MEMBERS- CONNECTS ALL OF I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN SENIOR VIDEO GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING US TO SHARE THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT THAT WE ISSUED LAST YEAR IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY- IS CERTAINLY- THE UPDATE HIS STATUS AS OF THE ONE YEAR RESPONSE WE RECEIVED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE TWO GENTLEMEN ME MISTER JOHN ADAMS WAS THE SUPERVISOR ON THE PROJECT AND DAVID KING WAS THE ATTORNEY ASSIGNED TO THE PROJECT THIS THE TEAM IN CONDUCTING AUDITS SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS GO THROUGH THE KEY ISSUE. WE HAVE FOUR KEY ISSUES- IN THE REPORT. AND THEN SIX RECOMMENDATIONS AND ASKED AS CHAIRMAN SALAS INDICATED. FIVE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE DIRECTED AT YOU SEE AND ONE. RECOMMENDATION WAS DIRECTED THE LEGISLATURE AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ONE AS WELL. AND THEN WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IF YOU AND I STATUS AS OF THE ONE YEAR RESPONSE SO AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE. ANYTIME THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ISSUED A REPORT. THE ENTITY THAT WE ARE AUDITING- PROVIDES RESPONSES AT SIXTY DAYS SIX MONTHS AND ONE YEAR ASKS YOU. HOW HOW MUCH PROGRESS THEY'VE MADE IN IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS SO I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT EACH OF THOSE- AS I GO THROUGH THE TESTIMONY TODAY. SO LET'S START WITH THE FIRST ISSUE AND ADDS. SHARES RAMOS INDICATED- ONE OF THE KEY PROBLEMS WE IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT WE LOOKED AT THREE CAMPUSES WE LOOKED AT. BERKELEY DAVIS AND YOU UCLA LOS ANGELES AND- IDENTIFY WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE DOING A GOOD JOB OF WORKING WITH TRIBES. I TO MAKE SURE THAT REMAINS FOR. YOU KNOW THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE REPATRIATION ACT- BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS REAL INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE CAMPUSES- UC BERKELEY HAD. THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ARTIFACTS AND REMAINS- ON YOUR CAMPUS AND THEY HAD NOT. DONE A GOOD KALAU AND WITH THE TRI TO MAKE SURE THOSE REMAIN WERE RETURNED TO THEIR TO THEIR RIGHT SO WE REALLY HAD TO SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO. THE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE THAT THE CAMPUS IS PARTICULARLY BERKELEY WAS REQUIRING OF TRIBES TO. CONFIRM THAT THAT TRIED WAS AFFILIATED WITH THOSE ARTIFACTS IN THOSE REMAINS AND THEN SIMILARLY AS FAR AS COMMUNICATION THERE NEEDS TO BE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CAMPUSES AND TRIBES. WITH RESPECT THE DISPOSITION OF SIMILAR PROCESS AGAIN BERKELEY WAS MUCH MORE STRINGENT AND THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF TRIBES RATHER THAN HAVING INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS. THEY WERE EXPECTING THINGS IN WRITING WHICH REALLY. DELAYED THE PROCESS THE ABILITY FOR. THOSE REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS TO BE RETURNED TO. THE RIGHTFUL OWNER OF THE APPROPRIATE TRY SO WE HAD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE OFF THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO SEE WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE IS THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT PROVIDING TWO CAMPUSES IN CALIFORNIA THE UC SYSTEM. OTHERWISE MINIMAL GUIDANCE SO THAT WAS ONE OF OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATIONS IS. REQUIRED. THESE CAMPUSES TO. PROVIDE ME TWICE A BY TO THE SYSTEM WHITE CAN SO THAT THAT'S SYSTEM COMMITTEE COULD REVIEW WHAT IS PERFECTLY COMPARED TO UCLA COMPARED TO DAVIS ARE WE BEING CONSISTENT AS A SYSTEM. AND OUR INTERACTIONS WITH TRIBES AND OUR EXPECTATIONS OF TRIBES AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE RETURN THOSE REMAINS IN THOSE ARTIFACTS TO THE APPROPRIATE TRIED. SO THE UNIVERSITY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS RECEIVED REPORTS FROM- VARIOUS CAMPUSES OUR CONCERN IS AND I'LL BE TOUCHING ON THIS IN A COUPLE OF OTHER THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS A SYSTEM WIDE COMMITTEE. IS NOT. REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT IT SHOULD SO WE REPORTS HAVE SENT TO THE- NURSE CALIFORNIA THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WHAT WE DON'T NO ONE WILL DO FOR THE FIRST MISTER BROWN IS WHO IS REVIEWING THOSE REPORTS IS THERE ANYTHING BE BE DONE WITH THOSE REPORTS. SO THAT YOU COPY YES THE PRESIDENT CAN'T BE WORKING WITH THE CAMPUS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROCESS IS IMPROVED SO THAT MANY AT THE REMAINS PARTICULARLY AT BERKELEY I RETURN TO THE APPROPRIATE TRIED ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO THAT IS. THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION HAS TO RECOMMEND NOMINEES INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOULD BE SERVING ON BOTH CAMPUS COMMUNITIES AND SYSTEM WIDE COMMITTEES. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR IN H. T. TO COME UP WITH QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS- BUT I DO UNDERSTAND FROM JIM JUST FOUND SOME RECENT INFORMATION THAT. AS RECENTLY AS JUNE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THAT. SHE WAS ABLE TO HOLD A SPECIAL MEETING TO CONSIDER NOMINATION SO- I AGAIN I'M GONNA DEFERRED AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVES. AS TO THE STATUS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT JUNE MEETING WHERE THERE WERE NOMINEES DETERMINED THAT SHOULD EITHER SERVE ON THE SYSTEM RIGHT COMMITTEE OR THE CAMPUS COMMITTEE SO. OUR OUR STATUS AS A FEW WAS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED YOU SEE IT RECEIVING THOSE REPORTS ON THE CAMPUSES BUT WHAT WE NEED NOW TO SEE IS THE% SYSTEM MIGHT COMMITTEE. PAINFULLY FORMS AND THEN REVIEWING THESE REPORTS AND THEN PROVIDING FEEDBACK AND GUIDANCE TO THE CAMPUSES. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT INCONSISTENCY WE STOCK OUR STORES EXPECTATIONS. CAMPUSES WITH RESPECT WORKING WITH THE SECOND ISSUE TO THIS ARE THE SAME RECORD REAL TO THIS ISSUE AS WE WILL WE WILL TO SEE UNIVERSAL THE OFFICE OF THE SENATE INFORMING THE TRIBES MAKING SURE THAT CAMPUSES ARE PROPERLY INFORMING TRIBES ABOUT ALL KNOWN MISSING REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS- AND WE EXPECT THAT TO BE DONE NO LATER THAN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY WE ISSUED A REPORT IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY SO WE THOUGHT. IT A COUPLE OF MONTHS- AND IF THE CAMPUS IS HAVE THEM SO LET'S FIGURE OUT AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE TRIBES. THIS IS ONE OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MISTER SALAS REFERRED TO THAT WE CONSIDER FULL EMPLOYMENT BUT I'M GOING TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF A COPY OUT TO THAT. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT FIGURE OUT WHICH CAMPUSES HAVE NOT COMMUNICATE WITH TRIBES THEY DID DO THAT THEY WENT THROUGH AND LOOKED AT- EACH OF THE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE ARTIFACTS AND REMAINS HEADWAY COMMUNICATED WITH PROJECTS TOO MANY MISSING REMAINS ETCETERA. THEY ARE ACTUALLY DETERMINE THAT UC BERKELEY. WAS THE ONLY CAMPUS THAT STILL NEEDED TO COMMUNICATE. WITH THE APPROPRIATE TRIBES IN THAT REGION. AND SO THEY HAVE COME UP WITH A PLAN TO DO SO PLAN TO COMMUNICATE WESTERN WITH SEEING ON THE APPROPRIATE PRICE WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN. THE PARTY YOU SEE KIDS HAVING IMPLEMENTED THAT PLAN WE'VE SEEN THE PLAN SEEMS REASONABLE- BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THOSE NEXT STEPS AND IMPLEMENT THAT PLAN AND WORK WITH. THE TRIBES ASSOCIATED WITH WITH UC BERKELEY- THAT WOULD HAVE. REMAINS OR ARTIFACTS SO THAT WAS THE FIRST KEY ISSUE IN THAT COMMUNICATION WITH THE PRICE SECOND IS WAS RE TO AND IS A LITTLE BIT WILL AS I GO MY HIGH WE LOOKED AT THE POLICY THE U. ALL WITH REESE TO NAG AND THEY TELL VERSION OF THAT AND AS YOU MAY KNOW MEMBERS INTO EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AMENDED CAL NABRIT MACRO IN REQUIRED THE UNIVERSITY TO DEVELOP CLEAR TRANSPARENT SYSTEM WIDE POLICIES AND THOSE NEEDED TO BE DONE BY JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY. NOW OF THE UNIVERSITY WAS ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT WAS WORKING WITH ANY. H. C. THE HERITAGE COMMISSION ERICA HERITAGE COMMISSION THERE COMMISSION ACTUALLY DISCUSS AND THEIR ASK YOU SEE IT THE WAY UNTIL JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THEY CAN PROVIDE COMMENT BECAUSE THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAS NOT BEEN A GOOD JOB IS. SHARING THAT DRAFT POLICY ALLOWING TRIBES TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH THE POLICY WHETHER THERE NEEDED TO BE MODIFICATIONS TO THE POLICY SO YOU SEATED AGREED TO DELAY. ISSUING THE FINAL POLICY UNTIL JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY BUT AGAIN THERE WERE ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT THE TRIBES HAD- SO THEY ENDED UP. ISSUING AN INTERIM POLICY AND STILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THE NATIONAL MERIT AND NATIVE AMERICAN EXCUSE ME HERITAGE COMMISSION ARE THEY STILL HAVE NOT FINALIZED THE POLICY THERE HAS BEEN COMMUNICATION BACK AND FORTH. BETWEEN AN AGENCY AND- YOU UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA- WE JUST BELIEVE IN THIS ONE WE SAY EXPANDING. BECAUSE THAT FINAL POLICY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED THERE HAS BEEN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU COP AND BUT AGAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER COLLABORATION COMMUNICATION. FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA YOU AN AC TO ALLOW ANY SEAT PROVIDE FEEDBACK WITH RESPECT TO THAT POLICY WE HAD ISSUES WITH THE POLICY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THERE WAS NO STANDARDIZED PROCESS FOR MAKING AFFILIATION DECISIONS. THERE WASN'T SIX SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT BY THE SYSTEM WHITE COMMITTEE ON THE CAMPUSES WORK SUBMITTING REGULAR REPORTS I JUST TALK ABOUT THAT IT'S AGO SO IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. YES THIS POLICY FINALIZED SO THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE AND A H. C. IS COMFORTABLE AND TRIED TO CONQUER S. C. APPROACH GO FORWARD THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO USE. IN WORKING WITH. THE TRUCK AND MAKE SURE THAT PLEASE AND ARTIFACTS AGAIN A RETURN TO THEIR THEIR RIGHTS ALONE SO THAT WAS THE SAN ISSUE IN THE AUTHOR THIS ISSUE AND ALL THESE ISSUES HOW TOGETHER THE THIRD ISSUE THAT WE HAD WAS MEMBERSHIP OFFICES WIDE CAMPUS COMMITTEE AGAIN ALLOW CAT AMENDED CALMAC THE VERSION OF THE ACT AND REQUIRED THAT THESE COMMITTEES BOTH CAMPUS COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHY COMMITTEES HAVE EQUAL REPRESENTATION OF UNIVERSITY MEMBERS AND TRIBAL MEMBERS. FROM AND WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT ISSUED IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. IN FACT I UC BERKELEY WAS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC BUT WE SAW PROBLEMS WITH THE COMPOSITION OF THOSE COMMITTEES AT EACH OF THE CAMPUSES THAT WE LOOK AT SO THIS WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN THAT WE HAVE- BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA WAS NOT COMPLYING WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT WAS WHEN IT MANDATE CAL MAG FOR. SO OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE CAMPUS AND SYSTEM WIDE COMMITTEES COMPLY WITH STATE LAW AND YOU NEED TO ACCOMPLISH. THAT BY NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. I THIS IS A RECORD THAT'S BEEN I'M HERE CAL AND WORK WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION BECAUSE THE- COMMISSION NOMINATES THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO EITHER SERVE ON A CAMPUS COMMITTEE OR SYSTEM WIDE COMMITTEE- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON SOME OF THE FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT'S BEEN IT A DIFFICULT PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY NHC HAS HAD SOME. LOST SOME ELDERS FROM THAT COMMITTEE- AND THEN THEY HAD DIFFICULTY IN GETTING TO MEET TOGETHER BUT AGAIN AS I AS pUNDERSTANDING HELD A SPECIAL MEETING IN JUNE. OF THIS YEAR TO ACTUALLY COME UP WITH NAMES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE NOMINEES FOR BOTH THE UC SYSTEM WHITE COMMITTEE AND THE CAMPUS COMMITTEE SO. THAT'S THE STATUS WE YEAH WOULD DEFER TO YOU SEE IF THEY HAVE MORE CURRENT REGARDING SOME IS AS OF JUNE TWENTY FOURTH EDITION ARE SO AGAIN THERE NEEDS TO BE PROGRESS BECAUSE THOSE THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE SO IMPORTANT AS FAR AS PROVIDING OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL BUT CLEARLY AT THE AT THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH WARNING ALSO PRESENT LEVEL AT SYSTEM WIDE COMMITTEES GETTING THESE- BUNNY THE ANNUAL EVERY SIX MONTHS REPORTS FROM THE CAMPUSES THAT SYSTEM MIGHT COMMITTEE. NEEDS THEY HAVE PROPER REPRESENTATION SO THAT THE VOICE OF PRICES FOR- AS WELL AS THE UNIVERSITY MEMBERS WE SAW ON. THE COMMITTEES WERE PRIMARILY UNIVERSITY MEMBERS WE NEED TO SEE MORE TRIBAL MEMBERS ARE FOR THOSE COMMITTEES TO REPRESENT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE EXPECTED WHEN IT AMEND IT AKAUN ACTOR IN BOTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. SO THAT RECOMMENDATION IS PENDING WE NEED TO SEE SOME PROGRESS PROGRESS THERE. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE- IS RELATED TO PUBLICATION OF A LIST OF TRIBES THAT CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZES AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROB. BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS BECAUSE HE HAD ASSEMBLY BUILT UP TO SEVENTY FIVE TO ADDRESS THIS. ISSUE THERE WAS SIMPLY A FEDERAL LEVEL- WHERE. THERE WEREN'T THERE WOULD BE FEWER TRIBES THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS- BECAUSE OF THOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS IT WENT FROM EIGHTY ONE TRIBES WORK CONDITIONING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR RECOGNITION DOWN TO FOUR SO IT REALLY LIMITED THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR TRIED TO CALIFORNIA TO BE LUTON LAST ANSWER BE ENGAGE IN THIS SEPARATE SO AB TWO SEVENTY FIVE WAS IN STATUTES OF TWO. IT MAN THAT THIRTY COMMISSION ARE GENERATE LIST OF TRYING. ON THE LIST OF RECORD CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES SO THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AT BUILD MISTER RAMOS WAS SUCCESSFUL WE TO THE GOVERNOR WAS SOMETHING IT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW SO THAT'S A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ALSO IN THAT LEGISLATION WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE AMERICAN MISSION% NOTIFY TRIED TO MUSEUMS AND OTHER ENTITIES EXISTENCE OF THIS LIST OF TRIBES AND THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE BY JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED SO THE NOTICE WENT OUT IN LATE DECEMBER NEWS DECEMBER THIRTIETH OR THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY BUT IT GOT DONE SO THAT ACTUALLY- WAS ACCOMPLISHED SO THIS LEGISLATION CERTAINLY HAS HAD AN IMPACT A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT IN IN GETTING CALIFORNIA IN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH RESPECT TO RECOGNITION OF TRIBES. AND CREATING THAT LIST OF CALIFORNIA TRIBES SO THE LAST RECOMMENDATION WAS- YOU TO ENSURE THAT MORE TRIBES CAN MAKE REPATRIATION CLAIMS AND H. YOU SHOULD PUBLISH THIS LIST NO LATER THAN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AC DID PUBLISHED ON THEIR WEBSITE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE LIST. AS I SAID THEY THEY PUT A NOTICE IN DECEMBER TWO AGENCIES MUSEUM STRIVES AT CETERA ABOUT THE PROCESS TO USED TO GAIN ACCESS TO THAT WE GET THAT INFORMATION FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION SO THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND REALLY HAS AFFECTED SOME POSITIVE CHANGE UP WHERE AGAIN WE NEED TO SEE MORE PROGRESS IS. THE CREATION OR THE COMPOSITION OF THE SYSTEM WIDE CAMPUS COMMITTEES YOU SEE NEEDS TO REALLY WORK HARD IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TO FINALIZE THAT. POLICY CONTINUE TO READ WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION GET THE STATE FROM THE TRIBES OF THAT GET THAT PART FULLY IMPLEMENT AND MY FINAL COMMON THIS AUDIT WAS REQUIRED BY SEA LAW HEALTH SAFETY CODE REQUIRED US TO ISSUE CONDUCTING WATER. THE FIRST ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO COMPLIANCE AND TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH FORCES THERE WE ISSUED A REPORT IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY JUNE ELEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY SO WE HAVE A FULL ONE YEAR RESPONSE THAT I'VE BEEN REFERRING TO. AND IT ALSO THE STATUTE ALSO REQUIRES US TO COMMENCE THE SECOND AUDIT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE CAN DO THAT WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE AND TO THE MEMBERS YES I WOULD I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR MY OFFICE TO WAIT A FEW MONTHS SO PROBABLY NOT START. UNTIL DECEMBER OR MAYBE EVEN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO IF YOU SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH AN AGENCY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS RECENT MEETING IN GERMANTOWN NOMINATE INDIVIDUALS FOR THOSE COMMITTEES LET'S GIVE THAT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME- AND IF WE START SOMETHING SAY IN JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ISSUE IT. IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY OF WHICH WOULD BE A TWO YEAR CYCLES SO THE LEGISLATURE SEEM THE INTENT WAS STARTED NOT IN TENTY NINETEEN STAR NOT IN SO IF WE IF WE GET SOMETHING ISSUED BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT GIVES YOU SEE SOMETIMES IT GIVES THE COMMISSION THE TRIBES AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE HOPEFULLY INFORMATION IN THAT IN THAT NEXT AUDIT REPORT THAT SHOWS THAT YOU KNOW FULL IMPLEMENTATION HAS OCCURRED OF ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE PARTICULAR UC BERKELEY TO GET THESE ARTIFACTS AND REMAINS ARE REPATRIATED. TO THE APPROPRIATE TRIBES SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND CHAIR SALAS WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU OR OTHER MEMBERS MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- AUDIT REPORT- COMING FORWARD ON THE PROGRESS OF THIS- THE IMPORTANT TOPIC IS THERE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WISHING TO. SEND. COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER DINA THANK YOU A MISTER CHAIR YES TO THE STATE I I'M I'M LOOKING HERE MY NOTES SUMMER OF THE AUDIT AND ON THE FIRST PAGE IS SAYS SOME CAMPUSES A RETURN LARGER PORTIONS OF REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS IN THEIR- COLLECTIONS. TO TRIBES SO I'M LOOKING AT IT IT SAYS SOME CAMPUSES AND SO THERE WERE THREE CAMPUSES CORRECT THREE THREE CAMPUSES THAT WERE ADDED. AND JUST CORRECT YEAH SO FOR MY CLARIFICATION- CAN CAN YOU JUST BE CLEAR FOR ME WHICH WHICH CAMPUSES ARE DOING A BETTER JOB THAN OTHERS. YES THIS IS JIM ADAMS THE AUDIT SUPERVISOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES HAS HAD THE MOST SUCCESS IN THE PAST TREATING IT- NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS. IT'S BEEN ABLE TO RETURN THOSE TWO TRIBES I THINK IT'S A MORE THAN 90% OF THE ITEMS AND REMAINS THAT IT HAD- STORED IN ITS COLLECTION OF ITS MUSEUM- UC DAVIS WAS ANOTHER CAMPUS THAT WE REVIEWED THAT HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN RETURNING REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS TO TRIBES. WHEN YOU TELL ME WHAT I WOULD PERCENT DAVIS HAS DONE YOU SAID UCLA. HAD RETURNED 90% THE ARTIST FIRST S. C. I CAN FIND OUT OF IN OUR OUR AUTO REPORT QUICK IF YOU WITH ME FROM SURE WELL USE DAVIS HAD A JUST A 2% RAISE RATE WE DID NOTE THAT THERE WAS A PARTICULAR COLLECTION THAT THEY HAD THAT HAD OVER FORTY THOUSAND ITEMS THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING TO RETURNS. I TRIED THAT- IS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA- AND SO IF WE- KIND OF TAKE OUT THAT THAT THAT LARGE- COLLECTION THERE- THEY HAD- REPATRIATED ABOUT 89% 89% OKAY AND THEN IF YOU I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT SO IF. YOU WOULD CONTINUE WITH. BERKELEY YES SO BERKELEY. TRYING TO COMPLY WITH NIAGARA AND RETURNING THE REMAINS OF THE TRIBE'S NAME ONLY HAS ABOUT 19% OF THE REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS IN ITS COLLECTION OKAY AND I HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THIS ISSUE- PROBABLY- GOING BACK MAYBE THREE OR FOUR YEARS I WAS AT UC REGENTS MEETING WHERE- TRAVEL CHAIR FROM THE CHUNGA CURRENT ADDRESSED. THE THE UC REGENTS SO WHAT WOULD YOU TELL ME. AS SOMEONE WHO'S VERY INTERESTED IN THIS MATTER WHAT WHAT IS KEEPING BERKELEY FROM DOING A BETTER JOB. AS COMPARED TO UCLA AND UC DAVIS SURE MISTER MEDINA AND I'LL AND I'LL DEFER TO MISTER ADAMS AND MAN ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH YOU BERKELEY'S ROACH IS THAT OVER EXPECTING TRIBES TO PROVIDE MUCH MORE EVIDENCE THAN OTHER UCLA OR UC DAVIS ALSO- WITH THREE STATUS WORK WITH RESPECT TO AFFILIATION AND THEN THERE'S A DISPOSITION JUST A DIFFERENT PROCESS AND THAT ONE IS ISN'T INVOLVES COMMUNICATION WITH THE DIFFERENT TRIBES SO REACHING OUT TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TRIBES HI JERRY TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. THEY ARE AFFILIATED OR OR ASSOCIATED WITH IT OF THOSE THREE ARE AND WHAT WE SAW THAT YOU SEE BURKE IS AND MORE STRINGENT PROCESS THEY WERE EXPECTING STUFF THEY REACHED OUT TO FIFTEEN TRIBES THEY WERE WAITING TO HEAR BACK IN WRITING. FROM EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE TRIED BEFORE THEY WERE WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE PROCESS AND WE FELT THAT THAT WAS VERY STRINGENT. NOW AGAIN I THINK THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THEY ALSO PRESENT NEEDS TO GET THAT POLICY WITH RESPECT TO FOLLOW THIS. REPATRIATION ACT IS GOING TO BE CARRIED OUT OUT THERE SO THAT THERE IS CONSISTENCY FROM ONE CAMPUS TO ANOTHER BECAUSE I THINK BERKELEY. IS BEING MUCH MORE RESTRICTIVE ON MAKING IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR TRIBES TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS AND FOR THOSE REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS BUT I'LL I'LL ASK HIM IF HE HAS ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL CONTENT AND AGAIN WHILE OTHER CAMPUSES HAVE. CLOSE 290% BERKELEY. IS ONLY WHERE AT WHAT ARE APPROXIMATELY NINE TWENTY FIRST HAS A TINY FOR. OF OUT THE RETURNING WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE RETURNED RIGHT AND THEY SIGNIFICAN THEY HAVE A VERY LARGE COLLECTION SO THERE ARE A LOT OF REMAINS AND ARTEFACTS AT UC BERKELEY STILL AT LEAST AT THE TIME WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT LAST YEAR I STILL HAVE IN ITS INVENTORY THAT IT NEEDS TO REALLY WORK VERY HARD AND RETURNING THOSE THOSE ARTIFACTS AND REMAINS- WE NEED TO SEE MUCH BETTER PROGRESS. WITH UC BERKELEY AND IT IF YOU COPY YOU KNOW REALLY FOCUSES AS WE SAID THERE'S THAT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT THEY DEVELOPED RELATED TO MISSING REMAINS BAKER PLAN TOGETHER BUT AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT PLANS MEDICAL MINUTES SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF FOCUS AND ATTENTION ON YEARS CALIFORNIA BERKELEY HOW TO IMPROVE THEIR PROCESS. TO START GETTING THESE REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS RETURNED. ONTO THE APPROPRIATE TRIBES AND PERHAPS THE CHAIR I DO WALKED IN HIS UNIVERSE COLLEGE THE REPRESENTED HERE IN THIS AREA YEAH IT WILL HAVE A PRESENCE IN THE NEXT TO A-SECTION. FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PROVOSTS ON MICHAEL BROWN AND RANDY KATZ VICE CHANCELLOR OF RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO HEAR FROM YOU SEE AND- WHAT THEY CAN'T DO BETTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE- QUESTIONS ANY OTHER MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF SALAS GERMAN SONGS AT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN RAMOS JUST QUICK QUESTION THAT THEY CAN BETTER MONITOR FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAMS WORK ON THIS AND FOR THE FOLLOW UP NOW. BUT LOOKING AT THE AUDIT YOU KNOW YOU FOUND THAT ONLY ONE OF THE THREE CAMPUSES PRESENTS CLAIMS TO THE CAMPUS LEVEL COMMITTEE THAT ADVISES- MACRA IMPLEMENTATION ALL THREE CAMPUSES YOU KNOW HAVE THESE COMMITTEES BUT ONLY ONE USE THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE TO OVERSEE AND APPROVE REQUESTS SO THE QUESTION REALLY IS YOU KNOW- WHY WHY DID ONLY ONE CAMPUS HE'S HE'S NOT THE OTHERS I KNOW YOU MENTIONED AND- AND YOUR BRIEFING EARLIER THE INCONSISTENCIES. BUT WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT LED YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WAS ONLY IMPLEMENTED FOR ON CAMPUS COMMITTEES WAS ONLY DONE AT UC DAVIS YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE UC DAVIS CAMPUS SNAPPER POLICY REQUIRED THEIR CAMPUS SNAPPER COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THESE DECISIONS THEIR INSULAR BY CHANCE I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE STRUCTURE IS A ON HOW THEY WANT THEIR THEIR MUSEUM BUT THERE SUPERVISORS DECIDED TO UPDATE THEIR KNACK FOR POLICY AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL IN A WAY THAT PROVIDED GREATER BY AND FOR THAT COMMITTEE AND TRIBES THAT WERE ON THAT COMMITTEE SO THE EACH OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE THEIR OWN- NETWORK POLICY AND THE TWO OTHER CAMPUSES THAT WE WORK YOU DIDN'T INCLUDE THAT KIND OF STUFF IN THERE IN THE REVIEW PROCESS. AND WITH THE SIDE OF THROUGH THE CHAIR BUT- NOW THAT WE'RE DOING THE ONE YEAR FOLLOW UP DID YOU FIND THE OTHER CAMPS IS NOW MOVING TOWARDS TOWARDS COMPLETING THEIR ON CAMPUS COMMITTEES TO ONE FULFILL THEM I COMPLETELY SO THERE'S EQUAL REPRESENTATION AND TO. JUST FURTHER IMPLEMENTING THE CAMPUS LEVEL COMMITTEES. I THINK THAT GOES BACK TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S DISCUSSION OFTHE DELAY IN NOMINATIONS AND FILLING THOSE COMMITTEES SO WE'LL DEFER TO THE YOU SEE THE- RESPONSIBLE YEAH MANY WALLACE AS I INDICATED. THEY THEY CAMPUS COMMITTEES IN THE SYSTEM LIKE COMMITTEE ARE OUR RELIANCE FIRST TRIBAL MEMBERS. TO GET NOMINEES FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION AS I SAID THEY JUST RECENTLY HAD A MEETING OUR SPECIAL MEETING ACTUALLY HELD A SPECIAL MEETING IS A NEW HOMEPORT THIS WAS IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. TO NOMINATE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT'S WHY IT THIS IS DURING MY COMMENTS THE UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT REALLY NEEDS TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY NOW TO TRY TO GET INDIVIDUALS APPOINTED TO THE SYSTEM WHITE COMMITTEE AND THOSE CAMPUS MAYES AND YOU CRAP NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THOSE CAMPUS COMMITTEES ARE PROVIDING THE PROPER OVERSIGHT. OVER THIS PROCESS OF REPATRIATING REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS SO THE NEXT VERY IMPORTANT STEP IS TO GET THOSE. COMMITTEES- I STAFF NOT AS BUT FULLY FORMED AND THAT THEY HAVE PROPERTY REPRESENT AS X. BY THE LEGISLATURE THERE NEEDS TO EQUAL OF NEW MEMBERS OF TRIBAL MEMBERS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE IN A VERY IMPORTANT NEXT STEP IF IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET. AGAIN THE NOMINATIONS- WERE VOTED DOWN AYE MY UNDERSTANDING IN JUNE BY THAT. MISSION SO WE'VE GOT TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK UC DAVIS I MR ADAM WAS INDICATING WAS SOMEWHAT MORE PROACTIVE THAN OTHER CAMPUSES. BUT AGAIN. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO GET THAT POLICY DONE THEY NEED TO GET THOSE COMMITTEES FULLY FORMED FULLY REPRESENTATIVE- SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROCESS SO. OVERSIGHT OVER. THE DECISION MAKING AND THE COLLABORATION COMMUNICATION WITH TRIBES SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN THANK YOU BETER MONITOR LOOK FORWARD TO THE UC'S RESPONSE ON THAT AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ANY OTHER MEMBERS.

AT DIFFERENT THAN THE PREVIOUS POLICY THE CURRENT POLICY EXPRESSES A CLEAR PURPOSE VISION GUIDING PRINCIPLES I BET PRIORITIZE REPATRIATION AS A FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVE AND VALUE OF THE UNIVERSITY- WE BELIEVE WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. UNDER THE INTERIM POLICY AND DOING WHAT WE CAN ABOUT- AS YOU HEARD FROM THE AUDITOR AT THE KEY TO. OUR MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION IS THOSE COMMITTEES BEING PUT TOGETHER WE THANK PUBLICLY I WOULD FORTY THANK PRIVATE BEFORE THEY COULD PUBLICLY. I B. NH C. FOR THE AT THE REC FOR A COMMITTEE MEMBER HAVE THAT I TOOK PLACE I JUNE TWENTY FOURTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE DOES COMMIT ARE BEING PUT TOGETHER I'M HAPPY TO SAY ARE ITS PRIME RIB TO ME THAT SEE A AND BERKELEY HAVE PUT THEIR COMMITTEES TOGETHER AND THE OTHER CAMPUSES ARE MOVING AGGRESSIVELY AND AT IN THAT VEIN- I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE POLICY- THE POLICY REQUIRES REEVALUATION OF PREVIOUS DETERMINATIONS. OF CULTURALLY ON IDENTIFIABLE HUMAN REMAINS REMAINS ARE ARE ASSOCIATIVE IN MEMORY ARE OBJECTS I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS POLICY AND IT HAS TO BE DONE NOW IN CONSULTATION WITH NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES AND THAT LINKS TO A NOTHER- IMPORTANT EVOLUTION AND POLICY THAT I MENTIONED A LITTLE LATER- THE POLICY INCLUDES MANDATORY. TRIBAL CONSULTATION AND TRIBAL APPROVAL FOR ACCESS TO HUMAN REMAINS AND CULTURAL ITEMS I'M NOT NOT EVERYONE CAN JUST GET ACCESS TO THESE REMAINS OUT WE WANT TO TREAT THAT PROCESS WE WANT TO KNOW WHO HAS ACCESS AND WANT TO TREAT THAT PROCESS RESPECTFULLY AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRY. THE ASSOCIATED TRIBES- NO- AND ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT ACCESS AND AS YOU KNOW- OUT FOR THE RESEARCHER- STRUCTURALLY OTHER PURPOSE- IS CONSTRAINED WITH OUT THAT APPROVAL- BYE. BY TRANS THE POLICY ALSO REQUIRES RECONSTITUTION AS THE ARTERY INDICATED- OF THE SYSTEM MY COMMITTEE AND CAMPUS COMMITTEE STUDENT CALLED EQUAL REPRESENTATION A NATIVE AMERICAN AND- AND YOU SEE. REPRESENTATION AND THAT AS WELL ON ITS WAY BUT I AGREE OUT- OUT WE WILL PICK THE PACE WE NEED TO PAY UP THE PACE I AM I HAPPY THAT IT'S HAPPENING- BUT- WE DO NEED TO ACTUALLY SHOW THE PROGRESS. AFTER OUR RECENTLY RECEIVING THOSE NOMINATIONS- I DO THINK- THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THERE IS SOME OF THE COMMITTEES ARE THAT THE COMMITTEES ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE A MUCH MORE PRO ACTIVE ROLE THEY WILL NOT JUST READ ACT A TO- WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THAT REQUIRE THE INVOLVEMENT THERE ACTUALLY ARE TASKED NOW BY THE POLICY- EVEN IN ITS INTERIM SPATE S. STATE TO BE VERY AGGRESSIVE. ABOUT DOING ALL THEY CAN TO ADVANCE REPATRIATION ACTIVITIES THE INTERIM POLICY BETTER HONORS AND DAHLE USE TRIBAL ORAL HISTORIES AND SOURCES OF EVIDENCE. SOMETIMES THAT'S THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT WE AVE AND AND TO BETTER HONOR THAT WILL HELP WITH RESPECT TO CULTURAL IDENTIFICATION AND REPATRIATION WE BELIEVE THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT A SINGLE NOW LONG EVIDENCE- AND THAT MIGHT BE A TRIBAL OR HISTORIES- AT THAT THAT WOULD BE ABOUT. TO ESTABLISH CULTURAL AFFILIATION ACT- AND- AND SO WE HOPE THAT THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE GOING FORWARD IN ACCORDANCE TO A. B. AT WITH EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE THE LATEST DRAFT OF THE POLICY EXPLICITLY REQUIRES DEFERENCE TO TRIBAL TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE. SO ALL CAMPUS REPATRIATION COORDINATORS PRESENTLY CONDUCT THEIR WORK AND ARE PREPARING. FOR CAL MAG WOULD REQUIRE OUR INVENTORY AND WITH THE PRINCIPLES ARE MIND I I'LL WITH MY TO I ET A MYSELF WITH THE PREACHER CORN TO. THAT POINT I'VE ALSO MET WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S DESIGNATED ARE LEADS ON ON ON REPATRIATION ACTIVITIES AT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PRIORITY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN COORDINATING TWICE MONTHLY MEETINGS WITH ALL CAMPUS REPATRIATION COORDINATORS AND POINTS OF CONTACT THIS ALLOWS FOR NORMALIZATION ACROSS THE CAMPUSES THE SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES BUT THE SYSTEM LIKE COMMITTEE WILL ALSO BE KEY TO THAT AS THE ARDOR POINTED OUT I AGREE. AND GETTING THAT COMMITTEE UP AND RUNNING I'LL OUT IS OUT FULLY UP AND RUNNING IS OF HARPER- I'M PORTANT LATE AS REQUIRED BY THE POLICY ALL CAMPS ARE. INITIATING CAMPUS WIDE SEARCHES FOR ANY PREVIOUSLY UNREPORTED HOLDING THAT MAY POTENTIALLY CONTAIN NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS CULTURAL ITEMS ETHNOGRAPHIC OR ARCHAEOLOGICAL OBJECTS LET ME SAY. THAT EIGHT GRIEVES ME- AT THAT SUCH OUR ARMED OUT ITEMS ANCESTORS MAY BE DISCOVERED BY THIS PROCESS BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T WANT IT- AS THOSE ALL TO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. AHEAD OF TIME BUT AS MUCH AS A ME ABOUT THAT I AM ALL JOIN THAT WE DO WANT COVER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OF WHERE OUR REMAINS ARE ARE OTHER CULTURAL ITEMS ARE FOUND AND DISCOVERED AND- HI AND SO IT'S A IT'S A BITTERSWEET SITUATION FOR ME BUT I'D MUCH RATHER ON HOWEVER THE REMAINS. AND CREEK EIGHT THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN THE ANCESTORS- AT AT THEIR PEOPLE AND TO RESPECTFUL REINTERMENT- ARE AS PAINFUL AS THAT MIGHT BE R. I AM CURRENTLY AND- AND I WANT TO SAY OUR PRESIDENT TO SO I DON'T WANT TO BREAK MY ARM HERE TRYING TO PUT MYSELF ON THE BACK WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY SEEK OUR INTERNAL FUNDING OUR RESOURCES TO FURTHER THIS WORK. I WANT TO STATE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IT'S NOT JUST THE UNIVERSITY BY THE WAY THAT NEEDS OUR RESOURCES TO EFFECT. AND THE BLUE ROUTE REPATRIATION PROCESS MANY OF OUR TRIBES. DUE TO THEIR NOT ALL I DON'T HAVE A RESOURCE AND- I NOT A ONLY BE IMPRESSED WITH ALL THE REVIEWS I'VE GONE. THROUGH AROUND THE STATE AND MEETING WITH TRIBAL PEOPLES HOW IMPORTANT- RESOURCES AND PLACES TO RE ENTER HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AND SO I JUST WANT TO MENTION- AS I MENTIONED ALL CAMPUSES ARE ARE ARE MOVING. FORWARD AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME THINGS FOR THIS COMMITTEE BUT I DO WANT TO SAY I UNDERSTAND THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE HERE SO PLEASE DON'T HEAR THIS LESS AS SOMEHOW SAYING THAT. THAT HE UNIVERSITY- I HAVE TO DO THAT SO I THINK YOU'VE GOT WAYS TO GO HERE BUT I DO WANT TO SAY I'M SEEING PROGRESS. IN PLEASE ALLOW ME TO STOCKPILE. SO UC DAVIS REPEATED RECORD PATRIOTA FORTY FIVE SETS OF INDIVIDUAL ANCESTRAL HUMAN REMAINS IN OVER FORTY ONE THOUSAND. FUNERARY OBJECTS TO JACKSON RANCH HERE TO REACT SHINGLE SPRINGS BAND OF MIWOK INDIANS AND- YOUR COULD DEDICATE OUR LENTEN NATION. IN ADDITION AS MANY TRIBES AT AS MANY TRIES A BIG SPREAD ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE. AND SECURE WITH BURIAL LAND AS A BERRY TO REPATRIATION UC DAVIS. HAS SUCCESSFULLY- FACILITATED GREEN THAT'S ALLOWING OUR TRIBES TO CONDUCT WITH VARIAS ON CAMPUS AND PRIVATE LIFE THAT'S NOT. THE CASE THAT CAN'T BE THE CASE THAT EVERY CAMPUS BUT I. AM WORKING ON AND FIND RESPECTFUL THAT COULD BE. I FOR THE RESPECTIVE RE OF A FOR NAY I'M TRIBES DON'T HAVE A LAND TO REINTERPRET I'M I IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE UC DAVIS WAS AWARDED A NATIONAL MAXPREPS CONSULTATION DOCUMENTATION GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE THE GRANT OF A WRITTEN COOPERATION WITH THE TRIBAL PARK WILL ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE LEVERAGES RESOURCES AND ACCELERATE REPATRIATION PRODUCT- PROGRESS FOR FORESIGHT IN THE NAPA AND SOLANO. SOLANO COUNTY UCLA WORKING WITH CONTROLLING AGENCIES TO FACILITATE REPATRIATION IS COMPLETELY A REPATRIATION OF HUMAN REMAINS AND FUNERARY OBJECTS TO THE PIE YOU INDIAN TRIBE OF UTAH HI IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND UC RIVERSIDE HAS COMPLETED AN INITIAL SH SORTING AND CATALOGING OVER FIVE THOUSAND. CARBON SAMPLES FROM ITS NOW DEFUNCT RADIOCARBON LABORATORY FINDINGS SEVENTY EIGHT SAMPLES CONTAINING HUMAN REMAINS SIXTY TWO OF THOSE SAMPLES HAVE BEEN I RETURN TO THE CONTROLLING INSTITUTIONS- SO THOSE INSTITUTIONS COULD BEGIN THE PROCESS OF REPATRIATION AND OTHERS ARE IN PROGRESS BUT I WANT TO SAY YOU SEE OUR WILL INITIATE CONSULTATIONS ON AT LEAST FOUR SAMPLES FOR WHICH YOU SEE DOES HAVE CONTROL UC SANTA BARBARA. IS ENGAGED IN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH MULTIPLE BAND OF THE CHUMASH PEOPLE LET ME ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- I'M HERE IN SANTA BARBARA- ON ON NATIVE- IN HISTORICAL TO MAX LINE- AB THE THEY CAN'T IS WORKING TO MY PEOPLE OUR OF IN OVER OF ALSO WARY A LOCATED ON CAMPUS AND GET INVENTORY. I HAD TO- ADD TO RELATIONSHIP BUILDING- OUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF REPATRIATION HI ADDITIONALLY YOU SEE STAFF HAVE MET WITH- THE REPOSITORY TO MASTER VISOR COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS THE REPATRIATION PROCESS AND TO HEAR RECEIVE AND ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT YOU SEE SAN DIEGO AS RECENTLY AS JULY THE TWENTY I. TWENTY ONE HAS HIRED A FULL TIME. AND MEDICAL COORDINATOR WHO HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN REPATRIATION ISSUES AND CONSULTING WITH TRIBES LOCAL TO THE SAN DIEGO AREA THAT CAMPUS IS IN COMMUNICATION WELL MORE THAN SIXTY TRIALS REGARDING ANCESTRAL REMAINS CULTURAL ITEMS FEW- FLORAL AND FAUNA REMAINS ASSOCIATED. WITH A FORMER- ECS AT LEAST FACTORED IN THERE. AND YOU SEE S. C. L. A. HAS COMPLETED AT THE LEGAL TRANSFER OF HUMAN REMAINS TEHAMA MOODS AND I TRAVEL BAN REBURIAL IS PENDING THE RESUMPTION OF CAMPUS AND TRIBAL OPERATIONS THAT HAD BEEN ON HOLD DUE TO PANDEMIC. AND I KNOW YOU WILL HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- FOR A UC BERKELEY VICE CHANCELLOR HI RANDY KATZ BUT IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THAT I COULD ADDRESS I'M HAPPY TO DO SO NOW. A QUESTIONS- FOR THE PROS. YEAH CAROUSELS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR I REMEMBER HEARING YOU WERE EXT YOUR AND WILLINGNESS TO ACTUALLY RESOLVE A LOT OF THESE THINGS THESE THESE MATTERS OF THESE ITEMS AB ONE I DIDN'T HEAR YOUR RESPONSE MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ELABORATE. IS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT A TIMELINE ON WHEN THOSE WILL BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED- WE KNOW ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED BUT WE'RE STILL HAVE FOR THAT ARE PENDING. AND I KNOW YOUR COMMITMENTS LIKE YOU'VE- STATED IS THERE TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES I JUST WANTED TO. GET A RESPONSE ON THE TIMELINE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ALL RIGHT AS I. INDICATED AT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS THAT- A LOT OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEEDS TO BE DONE IN COLLABORATION. WITH THE NHC AND I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT THE MEETING I HAD YESTERDAY OUR WITH THEIR I LEADERSHIP. OUT ON THE TIMELINE ISSUE OUR GOAL IS- ARE ARE OUT WE'RE WORKING ON TOGETHER. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE LANGUAGE GAPS IN THE POLICY TO CLOSE- THAT I DON'T WANT TO RUSH THE PROCESS OF COLLABORATION AS EAGER AS WE ARE AB AT TWO THE POLICY FROM OKAY ARE IS AT DECEMBER TO HAVE THAT POLICY FINALIZED. IF I CAN DO SO OUT TOMORROW I WOULD- BUT I DO BELIEVE WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS SO THAT WE'RE ALL COMFORTABLE. WITH THE FINAL LANGUAGE AT THE POLICY SO- HI IF I CAN GET A SOONER DATE FOR YOU ON THAT I WOULD I WOULD DO SO AND WOULD NOTIFY THIS COMMITTEE. AND IF MY TEAM IF I HAVE THAT HAVE THAT INFORMATION WRONG PLEASE JUST LET ME KNOW THEY GIVE US PROVIDES APPRECIATE THAT AND I AGREE WITH WORKING WITHIN A H. C. THAT NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE- COMMITTEE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU TALKED ABOUT IT IN YOUR TESTIMONY AND THE I'VE EVER MENTIONED AS WELL FOR THE CAMPUS COMMITTEES. TO BE A REPRESENTATIVE AND HOLISTIC AND- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN ISSUE I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DELAY IS AND- AND HAVING THOSE COMMITTEES FAILED GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND ABOUT 20% OF ALL THOSE TRIBES ARE IT 20% OF ALL THOSE TRIBES ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA THAT ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. SO JUST WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE UNIVERSITY'S PERSPECTIVEON WHY THESE COMMITTEES AND NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA TRIBES AND JUST. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND REALLY WHY THIS WASN'T DONE IN THE PAST AND I KNOW. WE'RE STILL MOVING FORWARD BUT GIVEN THAT THE ODD IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE AND THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS ALREADY. JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE SYSTEM WIDE APPROACH WHY THIS ISN'T DONE. AND AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS HERE YOUR QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT ABOUT WHY THE COMMITTEES BOTH SYSTEM WIDE IN CAMPUS COMMITTEES ARE ARE DON'T EXIST NOW AS FULLY CONSTITUTED AND HAVING- EQUAL MEMBERS OF NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES AND- AND UNIVERSITY REPRESENTATIVES IS THAT YOUR QUESTION I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M RESPOND I'M JUST. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COMMITTEES ARE FULFILLED YOU KNOW YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH ANY H. C. I'M SAYING THERE'S YOU KNOW HUNDRED AND EIGHT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE COMMITTEES ARE FILLED. IT ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN OF THE ODD REPORT IT SHOWS AT BERKELEY HAS NO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INSTANCE THAT ARE MEMBERS OF ANY FEDERALLY ARE CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA WHILE DAVISON UCLA DID HAVE MEMBERS OF TRIBAL PARTICIPATION IN SOME OF THOSE COMMITTEES. THIS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND LIKE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT- PREVIOUSLY WERE NOW WITH THE ONE YEAR MARK. CHECK IN AND JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN PROGRESS ACTUALLY FULFILL THESE COMMITTEES AND IT SEEMS THAT THE MOST EFFICIENT CAMPUSES OBVIOUSLY UC BERKELEY WHO HAS THAT NO MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE AS FAR AS- WHAT'S REPORTED IN THE AUDIT I BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAW THAT WELL UPDATE THAT THAT INFORMATION- BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- WHEN WE RECEIVED THE- THE NOMINEES FROM NHC JUNE TWENTY FOURTH. OUT OF A TWENTY TWENTY ONE- ARE A COUPLE CAMPUS WE OUT THE SISTER OFFICE DID ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION FROM IN H. C. R. IN THE IN JULY. AND WE HAVE GOTTEN THAT INFORMATION. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS BERKELEY MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO CONSTITUTE A COMMITTEE BUT I'LL ALLOW. THEM TO- AT AT THE STATE THE FACTS ON THE RECORD ON THAT AND I KNOW DO CL A HAS AND I MIL- THAT THE WORK IS BEING DONE TO CONSTITUTE THE COMMITTEES NOW. AS TO WHY THIS DIDN'T EXIST. FOR US ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS I DON'T KNOW HI- I AM JUST TO BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT THAT- MY FOCUS IS ON TO MOVE FORWARD HI END TODAY I DIDN'T THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE HAD. CORRECT THEM. AND GET US MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I AM HAPPY- WITH THE PARTNERSHIP THAT IT IS DEVELOPING- WITH THE INNATE AT THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE. COMMISSION I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT I AM THANKFUL FOR THE HELP FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR ON THIS AS WELL SO- I THINK IT HELPS US BE AND DO BETTER AND I'M- OUT I WISH I HAD BETTER. FOR YOU BUT I'M HOPING THE NEXT TIME I'M BEFORE YOU. THAT WE WILL HAVE HAD ALL OF OUR COMMITTEES WILL BE CONSTITUTED ALL OF THEM PROACTIVE AND OPERATING. ALL OF THEM MEETING IN WAYS THAT BRING HARMONY ACROSS ALL THE CAMPUSES IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES AND THAT YOU WILL SEE ACTIVE- TRANSITION OF REMAIN AND ARE MOVING TO THEIR PEOPLE AND AWAY FROM THE UNIVERSITY. AB SO THAT THIS CIRCLE THAT I JUST- I REVIEWED FOR YOU IN BRIEF THAT THAT WILL BE A FAR MORE ROBUST STREAM. OF ACTIVITY THANK REST PROVIDES APPRECIATE THAT I THINK I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO- I GUESS THE DUE DILIGENCE FROM THE SYSTEM TO NOT ONLY HAVE PRACTICE BEST PRACTICES LIKE YOU'VE INDICATED BUT CONSISTENT PRACTICES ACROSS ALL THE CAMPUSES- I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WHEN YOU LOOK AT. JUST THE AMOUNT OF REPATRIATION OF SOME OF THE REMAINS YOU KNOW UCLA OBVIOUSLY AT 96% UC DAVIS THAT 89% BUT YOU SEE THAT. ONLY BERKELEY HAS NINETEEN PERCENT- AND THEN YOU HEAR THAT YOU KNOW NO MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ON. HAVE EVEN BEEN PUT ON THE COMMITTEE FOR BERKELEY IT'S JUST JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT FROM- FROM THE PROVOST FROM THE SYSTEM THAT. THIS IS A MATTER THAT YOU GUYS TAKE SERIOUSLY DILIGENTLY AND I'M LOOKING FOR THAT'S WHY I ASKED ABOUT A TIMELINE SO THAT EVERYONE THAT'S LISTENING IN ON TODAY'S HEARING CAN UNDERSTAND THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AND THAT IS GOING TO BE DONE AND NOT JUST. YOU KNOW NEXT TIME NEXT TIME NEXT TIME AND THEN WHEN WE CHECK IN AGREEMENTS YOU KNOW YOU WERE WERE WERE BACK WHERE WE WERE WE STARTED IN SO JUST TRYING TO GET SOME RESULTS. SOME RESOLUTION ON SOME OF THESE ITEMS AT I. I AGREE WITH THAT AND- I HOPE. I HAVEN'T HAD ANYONE I'M I'M TALKING TO MY TEAM I HAVEN'T HAD ANYBODY UPDATE ME ON. ON THE TIMELINE BUT LET ME JUST SAY TO YOU. I'VE HEARD THE COMMITTEE'S REQUEST FOR THAT. AND LET ME WORK WITH MY TEAM TO GET IT A MORE DETAILED RESPONSE TO YOU. I WISH I COULD DO SO OR ON HERE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT I AT THAT'S A REASONABLE REQUEST THANK YOU THANK YOU THE CHAIRMAN SALAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA THANK YOU PROS BROWN GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US HERE THIS MORNING ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND I WILL COMMAND MY COLLEAGUE A MISTER SALAS FOR HIS PATIENTS N. AND FOR IS CLARITY AND EXPRESSING I THINK WHAT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE I DO NOT SHARE. MISTER SALAS IS PATIENTS. I AM SITTING HERE. SORT OF AT MY WIT'S END I DO NOT LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING BECAUSE ALL I'M HEARING ARE EMPTY WORDS THE SAME EMPTY WORDS THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FOR THE PAST. TWO THREE YEARS AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION- TO ME THIS IS- UNACCEPTABLE I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR CONTINUE EXCUSES FOR WHY BERKELEY CAN'T DO WHAT UCLA AND UC DAVIS HAVE DONE I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT OTHER CAMPUSES THAT YOU MENTION A UC RIVERSIDE UC SANTA BARBARA ARE DOING WELL BUT I'M REALLY TIRED OF HEARING EXCUSES FROM UC BERKELEY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORY. EMPTY PROMISES TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS AN ACCEPTABLE IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA HAS MADE APOLOGIES FOR PAST ACTIONS BUT HERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE FORM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MAKE EXCUSES AS TO WHY THINGS CAN'T GET DONE. AND AGAIN MY COLLEAGUES- MISTER SALAS EXPRESSED IT. VERY COHERENTLY I AM JUST SIX PRESSING MY COMPLETE. I DON'T KNOW FRUSTRATION- AND JUST- UNACCEPTABILITY OF WHAT I'M HEARING. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS AT CONTINUED TO HEAR THE SAME THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO BETTER WE'RE GOING TO DO BETTER AND NOTHING HAPPENS IT YOU KNOW I WAS IN A HEARING ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND I REMEMBER THE PROFESSOR FROM BERKELEY WHO SAID THINGS HAPPEN WHEN THEY WANT TO HAPPEN I THINK THAT IS TRUE I THINK IT'S TRUE IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS- CERTAINLY IN HIGHER EDUCATION I THINK IT'S TRUE WHEN THERE'S A WILL TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AND I THINK UCLA AND UC DAVIS ARE EXAMPLES OF THAT THEY HAPPEN AND SO THEY KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS LEGISLATURE TO THIS COMMITTEE AND GIVING EXCUSES AS TO WHY THEY HAVEN'T HAPPENED IS UNACCEPTABLE I BELIEVE I READ AN ARTICLE IN THE PRESS. THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE AT UC BERKELEY WHO DIDN'T EVEN REPORT ALL OF THE MATERIALS THAT WERE IN THEIR POSSESSION OR THAT MISS REPORTED THE MATERIALS IN THEIR POSSESSION SO I YOU KNOW I- JUST WOULD SAY TO YOU PROGRAMS BROWN THAT AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION IT'S IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT IS BERKELEY IS DOING IS A DISMAL FAILURE. AND TO ME AS CHAIR IT IS UNACCEPTABLE- I AM TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME EXCUSES. THANK YOU OF ANY COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA ASSEMBLY ONE BOERNER HORVATH YES AND I'LL ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGES ON MY PATIENCE IS LONG GONE I WENT TO UC BERKELEY AND I TOOK MY CULTURE STUDY RECENT REQUIREMENT BY TAKING NATIVE AMERICAN CITIES AND LEARNED THAT NATIVE AMERICAN ARTIFACTS. ARE VALUABLE CULTURAL RESOURCES THAT WOULD NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND RETURNED THAT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE. THAT'S WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME AND SO WHEN I READ THIS REPORT IT'S BEEN YEARS TO CORRECT THIS FIND THE WELL THERE'S NO WAY I'M I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES THERE ARE MUCH MORE POLITE THAN I AM BUT I'M I'M NOT GONNA SPEND ANY MORE MONEY TO DO THIS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS ALREADY YOU'RE ALREADY DOING ANY UNIVERSITIES. SO I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THE EXCUSE LIKE WE NEED MORE MONEY WE NEED MORE COLLABORATION THAT'S ALL GREAT BUT THERE'S NOTHING INHIBITING YOU FROM DOING THIS BY THE DEADLINE THAT THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE DONE BY. SO I'M HOPING WHEN WE NEXT YEAR IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS BY THE TIME WE GET TO NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M GONNA GET A REPORT ON MY DESK THIS IS THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SOLVED AND THIS IS HOW THEY'RE SOLVED. BECAUSE OF LONG TIME COMING AND IT IS ARE DUE TO OUR- OUR TRIBAL ARM UP IN OUR OUR NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE UNITED STATES. TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT BY THEM THEY'VE HAD A LOT DONE WRONG BY THEM. SO LET'S FIX IT AND STOP MAKING EXCUSES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY ONE BOERNER HORVATH- AYLER COMMITTEE COMMENTS SO FROM BERKELEY WELL THANK YOU- MR PROVOST AND CONTINUE TO SEE THE FRUSTRATION OF BUILT WITHIN THE COLLEAGUES HERE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND TO CATCH UP RIGHT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT AND I HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT OUT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED. THOUSAND NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT IT WAS A SAMPLE POLLING OF UNIVERSITIES SO THAT'S NOT EVEN A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE 100% OUT THERE AND YOU SEE SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING THE PROCESSES- MOVE FORWARD AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE INDIAN COMMUNITY. I THANK YOU FOR- PRESENTING AND BEING HERE WITH US ON THE NEXT BAKER WILL BE MISTER RANDY KATZ VICE CHANCELLOR FOR RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. THANK YOU- TERRAIN MOST- AND CHAIRS SALAS MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS AND OF COURSE THE TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES RESPECTED GUESTS I WANT TO WISH YOU A GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS RANDY HOWARD KATZ AND THE CHANCELLOR'S THE BERKELEY CHANCELLOR'S CAMPUS DESIGNATE FOR NECRO IN MY ROLE AS VICE CHANCELLOR FOR RESEARCH THE FIRST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY WHICH HOLDS THE NATIVE AMERICAN ANCESTORS AND ARTIFACTS UNDER OUR CARE REPORTS TO ME BOB STOPS WITH ME I THINK KNOWLEDGE THAT MY CAMPUS IT'S ON THE TERRITORY OF THE WHO THE ANCESTRAL AND UNCEDED LANDS OF THE CHURCH ANNUAL ALONE ANCHOR THE SUCCESSORS OF THE HISTORIC AND SOVEREIGN BAND OF ALAMEDA COUNTY WE AFFIRM INDIGENOUS SOVEREIGNTY AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BERKELEY THE COUNCIL VOTE TO AMERICAN INDIAN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE I THINK KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR CAMPUS HAS NOT ACHIEVED THE TIMELY REPATRIATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN ANCESTORS AND BELONGINGS IN THE PAST WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING BETTER IN THE FUTURE. AND I BELIEVE WE ARE DOING BETTER I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE AUDIT WAS PERFORMED IN TWENTY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND I HOPE TO ADDRESS THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THIS TESTIMONY TO THIS POINT OVER THE PART OF THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE MADE SYSTEM SYSTEMIC CHANGES TO OUR PRACTICES REGARDING KANNST CONSULTATION AND REPATRIATION AND ARE HEARING TO ALL NAC PROP CALLUM THAT PRO. AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA POLICY I AM PERSONALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH TRACK WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY TO DEVELOP MORE PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND ENGAGE COLLABORATIVELY. IN THE DECISION MAKING AS EVIDENCE OF OUR NEW PRACTICES AND COMMITMENT ARE INACCURATE VICE RE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN RECONSTITUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH U. C. O. P. POLICY EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I AND THIS WAS DONE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION WE ARE NOW SCHEDULING MEETINGS WITH THE CURRENT ACADEMIC YEAR THE NEW COMMITTEE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR DRAFTING OUR REPATRIATION STRATEGIC PLAN I HAVE INCREASED OUR OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION WITH TRIED. TO THE WORK OF OUR RECENTLY APPOINTED NARAL PRO LIAISON A POSITION FORMED ONLY FIFTEEN MONTHS AGO. WE HAVE ENGAGE WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED TRIBAL ENTITIES THESE GROUPS HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE MAJORITY OF THE ANCESTORS AND ARTIFACTS UNDER OUR CARE SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED OUR CONSULTATIONPRACTICES IN OUR DELIBERATIONS NOW PRIVILEGE TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IN ANY DECISIONS THAT WE UNDERTAKE. WE ONLY REQUIRE SUFFICIENT SUBMISSION TO ESTABLISH A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE AS EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS AND IT'S VERY FIRST MEETING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARE RECONSTITUTED KNACK PRESS VAISAKHI COMMITTEE APPROVED A CLAIM IN TEN MINUTES THAT HAD BEEN IN PROCESS. FOR FOURTEEN YEARS DUE TO CONTINUING REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WE HAVE A NEW PROCESS A MORE AGILE PROCESS IN A STRONG COMMITMENT TO REPATRIATION AND COLLABORATION WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE NO LONGER DELAY DISPOSITIONS WHILE WE WAIT FOR ALL CONSULTED TRIES TO RESPOND. INSTEAD WE CONSULT WITH TRIBES TO DEFINE A REASONABLE CONTACT IN WAITING PERIOD THIS ALLOWS US TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSFER OF CUSTODY WHILE RESPECTING THE INTERESTS OF THE CONSULTANT PRICE NO I KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE ITEMS IN OUR INVENTORY THAT ARE MISSING. THIS BRINGS GREAT DISPLAYS THERE AND SUFFERING TO ME. IT IT ON BEHALF OF THE EFFECT THAT I KNOW THAT THIS HAS ON THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WE NOW LIST ALL KNOWN MISSING ITEMS AND ARE ACTIVELY CONSULTING WITH TRIBES TO CONDUCT FURTHER SEARCHES WITH THEIR PERMISSION SO AS NOT TO CAUSE HARM OR DAMAGE TO ANCESTORS AND BELONGINGS. UNDER OUR CARE IN KEEPING WITH THE INTERIM POLICY WE CONDUCTED OUTREACH TO THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT NO NATIVE AMERICAN ANCESTORS ARE HELD OUTSIDE THE HEARST MUSEUM THIS PROCESS IDENTIFIED A SET OF REMAINS THAT WERE INAPPROPRIATELY HAVE ONE OF OUR OTHER MUSEUMS. WE RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY AND ENSURE THAT THE IDENTIFIED REMAINS WERE RETURNED TO THE AFFILIATED TRIBES I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE POLICY WORKED AS IT WAS INTENDED TO WORK BY COMMUNICATING TO OUR CAMPUS WE IDENTIFIED. ITEMS THAT WERE MISSED HELPED AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO REACT QUICKLY TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE UNDER PROPER CARE AND ACCELERATED THE REPATRIATION AND RETURN OF THOSE ANCESTORS TO THE APPROPRIATE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES LOOK I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO ACHIEVE FULL REPATRIATION OF ANCESTORS AND BELONGINGS THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS 95% OF UC'S HOLDINGS IN THIS REGARD ARE LOCATED AT BERKELEY OUR CULTURE OUR HOLDINGS ARE MUCH MUCH LARGER. THAN UCLA DAVIS OR THE OTHER UC CAMPUSES WE HAVE A WE HAVE A HEAVY LIFT CENTAGE IS DON'T REALLY CAPTURE THE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF- ANCESTRAL REMAINS AND FUNERARY OBJECTS AND OTHER CULTURAL ITEMS THAT ARE IN THE BERKELEY COLLECTION COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE UC SYSTEM. WE ARE COMMITTED. TO WORK WITH OUR CAMPUS AND WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS TO SECURE THE NECESSARY STAFFING AND FUNDING. TO ACCELERATE THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE BEGUN IN WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING IN THE FUTURE. I LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING AND IN FRANK. REGARD REBUILDING TRUST BETWEEN OUR CAMPUS THE TRIBES WHOSE ANCESTORS ARE IN OUR CARE AND OF COURSE WITH YOU THE STATE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THEIR. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES RENAISSANCE THANK YOU RESTAURANTS SAID JUST QUICK QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE YOU MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THE PERCENTAGES BUT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN YOU KNOW WHY THAT'S WHY IT'S TAKEN SO LONG FOR THE COMMITTEES AND I BELIEVE IN THE AUDIENCE ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT FOR THINKIN SEE IF I CAN-FIND IT IN THE ADDED I WANT TO QUOTE IT CORRECTLY I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND IT HERE BUT BASICALLY THE AUDITOR'S CONCLUSION. ALLUDES TO THAT ALLUDES OR COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT BERKELEY'S APPROACH YOU KNOW UNNECESSARY LIFE UNNECESSARILY PROLONGS THE PROCESS OF REPATRIATING REMAINS AND I BELIEVE THE AUDIT REPORTED YOU KNOW UC BERKELEY- YOU KNOW CENTERS INITIAL LETTER OUT TO SOME OF THE TRIBES THEY DID HEAR FROM MANY YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY CLAIM AND YOU CAN TELL ME BECAUSE YOU'RE A BERKELEY HERE THE COP THAT THE CAMPUS IS NOT CONNECT FOR THE WORK ON A. BECAUSE QUOTE IT IS NOT THE CAMPUS PLACE PRESSURE TRIBES RESPOND TO THE TIMELINE THAT IT SETS AND QUOTE. AS A RESULT OF TOOK ANOTHER TWENTY MONTHS UNTIL THE EVENTUAL RETURN OF THE REMAINS. AB THE TRIBE WAS CLAIMING SO TOOK ANOTHER SO TOOK MORE THAN THREE YEARS FOR THIS PROCESS IN WHICH I SEE NO OTHER TRIBE DISPUTED. WHO SHOULD RIVER WHO SHOULD RECEIVE THE REMAINS- SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS UC BERKELEY GOING TO DO TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE AND ENSURE MORE TIMELY PROCESS. UP TO THREE YEARS TO. REPATRIATE THESE REMAINS- YOU SAID YOU YOU'VE IMPLEMENTED A NEW POLICY DOES THAT MEAN WHAT'S THE TIME LINE LOOK FOR TRIBES THAT ARE LOOKING AT RECLAIMING- REMAINS. YES THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS YES THE HOMELESS- AGAIN I IN MY TESTIMONY I MENTIONED- THAT OUR COMMITTEE WAS ABLE TO RENDER A DECISION IN TEN MINUTES COMPARED TO MANY MANY MONTHS PREVIOUSLY AND I THINK THAT'S INDICATIVE OF OUR REVISED WHAT I SHOULD SAY IS PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO POLICY- THERE ARE SEVERAL STEPS AFFECTED STEPS THAT WE'VE TAKEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS INCLUDING THE APPOINTMENT. OF A FULL TIME CNAC PROCREATE SON WHO WORKS PROACTIVELY WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO IDENTIFY ITEMS IN OUR COLLECTION OF INTEREST TO THEM AND CAN ASSIST THEM IN PREPARING THE SORT OF NECESSARY- SORT OF- PAPERWORK IF YOU WOULD TO- GO THROUGH THE SORT OF FEDERALLY MANDATED PROCESS SEES FOR RETURNING- ITEMS- THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IT WE NO LONGER- PLAY THE WAITING GAME- GIVE US MORE EVIDENCE GIVE US MORE EVIDENCE GIVES MORE EVIDENCE EACH ONE OF THESE INTERACTIONS TAKING LITERALLY MONTHS IF NOT YEARS TO COMPLETE A CYCLE. WE'VE NOW MOVED TOWARDS- TAKING A MUCH GREATER WEIGHT OF ORAL TESTIMONY AND- WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR- ARCHAEOLOGICAL- PROOF- AFFILIATION BUT WE'RE WE'RE FOLLOWING- THE NEW PROCESS- LISTENING TO ORAL TRADITIONS AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. WHICH WILL WILL HELP US IN A MUCH MORE RAPID APPROACH- IN ORDER TO RENDER A DECISION TO- REPATRIATES SO THERE ARE NUMEROUS THINGS BOTH IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL STAFFING IN ADDITIONAL STAFF ROLES. TO WORK PROACTIVELY AND COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND AN INTERNAL PROCESS THAT- YOU KNOW VALUES AND PRIVILEGES THE ORAL HISTORIES AND TRADITIONS SO THAT WE CAN GET TO A REPATRIATION DECISION MUCH FASTER. THESE ARE EXAMPLES- OF I THINK- THESE KINDS OF APPROACHES HAVE BEEN USED AT OTHER UC CAMPUSES AND IS A PART OF THE VALUE OF THE SYSTEM WIDE APPROACH. THAT YOU SEE AS THAT WE CAN LEARN BEST PRACTICES FROM THOSE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE DONE WELL IN LARGELY IF NOT COMPLETELY REPATRIATING THEIR HOLDINGS SUCH AS UCLA AND DAVIS- WERE WERE ADOPTING THEIR BEST PRACTICES SO THAT WE CAN MOVE THROUGH WHAT AMOUNTS TO THE LARGEST COLLECTION. OF HOLDINGS WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM. IN A MUCH MORE RAPID MANNER THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND- LOOK FORWARD TO MORE. EXPEDIENCY AND THAT WITH THE- WITH THE NEW- POLICIES- JUST QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THE UC BERKELEY- CONTAINS A LARGE INVENTORY AND- THINK IT WAS REPORTED THAT OVER HALF A MILLION TRIBAL ARTIFACTS ARE ACTUALLY IN UC BERKELEY'S POSSESSION- AND I KNOW YOU SAID. YOU KNOW PERCENTAGES. DON'T DO- DON'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY BUT CAN YOU TELL ME OF. THOSE TRIBAL REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS HOW MANY HAVE BEEN REPATRIATED OF THE NEARLY HALF A MILLION YES WELL I WILL GET YOU YOU KNOW SORT OF FULL INFORMATION IN A FOLLOW UP ON THAT BUT I DO HAVE SOME STATISTICS AT MY FINGERTIPS OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS JUST TO PUT THINGS IN IN PERSPECTIVE. SO WE OVER THE PAST YEAR WE REPATRIATED TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT CENTS OF ANCESTRAL REMAINS- IF I RECALL THE RIGHT NUMBER WE HAVE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND- WE HAD OF REPATRIATION A FEW YEARS AGO A FIFTEEN HUNDRED REMAINS- SO TWO HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT OVER YEAR DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S INDICATIVE OF. OUR EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE THE RETURN- OVER ALMOST SIXTEEN THOUSAND SETS OF FUNERARY OBJECTS WERE RETURNED IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS AND TWENTY THREE CULTURAL ITEMS WE HAD SEVEN NOTICES OF A REPATRIATION OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS AND I LEARNED THIS MORNING WE HAD AN EIGHT THAT WAS PUBLISHED YESTERDAY SO THESE ARE SIGNATURES OF HOW WE'RE TRYING TO ACCELERATE. BUT CHAIR CHAIR SALAS I ALSO WANT TO PUT IN THE IN THE PERSPECTIVE OKAY TEN THOUSAND UMAN REMAINS WE WISH TO REPATRIATE ALL OF THEM. ARE IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE DONE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YOU CAN DO THE MATH THIS IS JUST AN ENORMOUS LEFT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY TO WHOM THESE REMAINS ARE- AFFILIATED WITH THE LONG TWO OR THE APPROPRIATE DESCENDANTS- WE DON'T WANT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THAT BUT JUST THE SHEER NUMBERS REPRESENT A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE FOR US WITH OUR EXISTING RESOURCES. TO GET FROM THREE HUNDRED A YEAR TO A NUMBER MORE LIKE. THREE THOUSAND A YEAR. WHICH IS WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND JUST AS FOLLOW UP WHAT WOULD YOU NEED TO ACCOMPLISH THAT I MEAN. I WOULD IMAGINE DNA TESTING HELPS A LOT SHE SAID USE A DIFFERENT METHODS TERRITORIAL. AND WHAT NOT BUT WHAT. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET THERE TO THE THREE THOUSAND METER YES WELL THE AYE AYE AGAIN AN EXCELLENT QUESTION SHARE SALAS- DNA TESTING IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE USE OUR BECAUSE IT'S IN THE DESTRUCTIVE MATH METHOD AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY MANY CULTURAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH- USING THAT KIND OF APPROACH SO THE WAY THAT WE ARE GOING FORWARD IS THAT MANY OF THE ANCESTRAL REMAINS A LARGE VERY LARGE NUMBER OF THEM. I AS ONE COULD IMAGINE WERE FROM THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF THE UP ALONE EIGHT PEOPLE AND- THE SORT OF BAY AREA COMMUNITIES AND SO BY WORKING WITH THAT GROUP OF- TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WE ARE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO REPATRIATE VERY LARGE NUMBERS. OF REMAINS IN A SINGLE ACTION IN A SINGLE INTERACTION WITH THE TRIBES AND THROUGH THE NECESSARY THE DICTATED BY POLICY PROCESS SEEMS TO DO IT SO THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE TAKING IS TO IDENTIFY THOSE ITEMS AND ANCESTORS WITHIN OUR COLLECTION. THAT WE ALREADY KNOW BECAUSE OF THE GEOGRAPHY THE COMMUNITY OF INTEREST ARE SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THEM TO ACHIEVE LARGE GROUP REPATRIATIONS. SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THAT'S OW WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO THE VERY LARGE NUMBERS AND OF COURSE IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED. THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF- YOU KNOW SORT OF STAFFING SUPPORT- IN ORDER TO DOCUMENT THOSE THINGS AND SO ON AND I I'D MENTION THAT NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN. WE ARE ENTIRELY COMMITTED TO REPATRIATING OUR ENTIRE COLLECTION AS SOON AS IS FEASIBLE IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF GETTING THOSE INVENTORIES CORRECT CORRECT IDENTIFYING THE COMMUNITIES TO INTERACT WITH WORKING WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES TO ESTABLISH THE RIGHT DOCUMENTATION SO THAT WE CAN DO VERY LARGE GROUP REPATRIATIONS- OF. ALL IN THE SINGLES WOULD GOT IT UNDERSTOOD APPRECIATE THAT AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE REPORT A LOT OF IT. POINTS TO INADEQUACIES AT UC BERKELEY. AND OTHERS ASKING THE SAME QUESTION LAST PROPOSES- WHEN YOU ANTICIPATE. I GUESS JUST FOR UC BERKELEY ANYWAYS IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE AUDIT REPORT YEAH SO- AS I MENTIONED TO OUR- WE HAVE ALREADY RECONSTITUTE ARE NAG ADVISORY COMMITTEE EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE'RE ONE OF THE TWO UC CAMPUSES THAT THAT ACTED ON THE COMMITTEE. RECOMMENDED THAT THE- AUDIT FINDING ABOUT ESTABLISHING- COMMITTEE WITH TRIBAL REPRESENTATION WE'VE GOT THAT SINCE JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR WE'RE READY TO- COURSE SCHEDULING- THE SET OF MEETINGS FOR THE COMING- ACADEMIC HERE% TO REVIEW CASES AND TO MAKE REPATRIATION DECISIONS SO WE'RE WELL ADVANCED IN THAT. IN TERMS OF THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO OF LOST ITEMS- WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR INVENTORY WE- HAVE IN MAKE SURE THAT IT IT KEEPS TRACK OF ALL LOST KNOWN ITEMS- AND WE ARE IN CONSULTATION WITH TRIBES ON HOW TO IDENTIFY THOSE SO WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE FOR DEALING WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION. AND THEN- THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION WAS TO MODIFY OUR PROCESSES TO- THAT WHILE BERKELEY WAS HELD OUT AS AS HOLDING AS OUR STANDARD AN EXCESSIVE DEMAND FOR EVIDENCE BEFORE MAKING IT A REPATRIATION DECISION AS I MENTIONED WE NOW AWAIT VERY HEAVILY- TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE- ORAL TRADITION GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND WE DO NOT WISH TO OVER BURDEN. THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY WITH WITH HIGH LEVEL OF DOCUMENTS WRITTEN- SCIENTIFICALLY COLLECTED THE AND VALIDATED EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO DRIVE OUR REPATRIATION PROCESSES SO I THINK WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO MAKING PROGRESS ON ALL OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDIT. RIGHT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS THAT STILL DIDN'T HEAR TIMELINE ON THAT BUT. DO YOU IT HERE'S AND ALLOW I KNOW FOR THE ARTIFACTS IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME BUT- FOR SOME OF THE THINGS LISTED ON THE AUDIT OBVIOUSLY SAID JULY FIRST YOU HAD SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS A LISTENING USE THAT COMMITTEE IS. FAILED YES SO OKAY THANK YOU AND I'M JUST SO TIMELINE WISE YOU'VE MET SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ALREADY YOU SEE YOURSELF FOR FAILING ALL OF ALL OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHAT GIVEN TIMELINE AGAIN I'M SORRY YES SO- AS I MENTIONED THE COMMITTEE WAS WAS CONSTITUTED IN AN EMPANELLED IN THE FORM OF THE- POLICY RECOMMENDATION WITH CONSULTATION WITH A NATIVE AMERICAN ITAGE EFFECTIVE JULY FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THAT ONE. WE GOT A WE HAVE NOTIFIED OUR INVENTORIES TO RECORD ALL OF THE LOST ITEMS THAT WE KNOW- I THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED AND I MENTIONED THAT WE REVISED OUR- PROCESS FOR- YOU KNOW- WAITING AND LISTENING TO EVIDENCE FROM THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND THIS WILL NOW GO INTO EFFECT IN THE IN THE MEETINGS THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF SCHEDULING TO REVIEW REPATRIATION REQUEST. OVER THE- YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT ACADEMIC YEAR SO I CAN CONFIDENTLY STATE THAT ALL OF THE AUDIT- RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED THANK YOU APPRECIAT THAT- JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU NEED FROM THE LET'S JUST SAY IT LEGISLATURE SIDE FROM RESOURCES TO KIND OF MOVE UP TO. THE GOAL OF THREE THOUSAND ANCESTRAL REMAINS BEING REPATRIATED EVERY YEAR. IS THERE ANYTHING POLICY WISE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE EITHER- AT- YOU COP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THAT TO HELP YOU IMPLEMENT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IT. AT BERKELEY OR IS THERE ANY FURTHER AUTHORIZATION YOU NEED FROM THE LEGISLATURE BUT AGAIN AN EXCELLENT QUESTION YOU KNOW I REALLY THINK THAT- YOU GETTING OUR INTERIM POLICY TO BECOME THE POLICY WILL BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL- LEADERSHIP FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF. REALLY SHARING BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE SYSTEM- YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT THE LEGISLATOR HAS DONE IS BASICALLY- YOU KNOW PRODDED US INTO ACTION AND- I REALLY- HELP THE UNIVERSITY RE ORIENT HIS THINKING TOWARDS OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO REPATRIATE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. TO DO THAT WE NEED THE RESOURCES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT BUT I THINK- YOU KNOW WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE CAN ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF. A MY PERSONAL GOAL IS TO REPATRIATE THOSE ANCESTRAL REMAINS WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND YEAH I KNOW RESOURCE IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE BUT YOU KNOW I BELIEVE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF BUDGETARY EVERY TIME WE TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET I KNOW- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S RECEIVED- ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND WE'VE ALWAYS FOUGHT FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION SO. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS WE NEED TO LINE ITEM SOME OF THOSE BUDGET. AUGMENTATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO HELP YOU MEET THESE GOALS- BUT I GUESS T'S A FURTHER DISCUSSION WHEN WE GET BACK INTO OUR BUDGET COMMITTEES THANK YOU THANK YOU- CLOSE COMMENT SOME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ON THIS THE REPATRIATION PROCESS TO THE NAY AMERICAN PEOPLE IS NOTHING NEW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE ON SINCE- THE CREATION OF THE UC SYSTEM STARTING WITH- THE PERSON OF IT IS A CALIFORNIA NINETY SHE- SO IT'S NOT A NEW TOPIC AND FEELING THE FRUSTRATION OF SOME OF THE MEMBERS IT DID CHIME IN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- THE ORAL HISTORY- IT TOOK A PIECE OF LEGISLATION AB TWO SEVENTY FIVE TO IMPLEMENT. AND TO BASICALLY- FORCE THAT ORAL TRADITION TO BE ACCEPTED WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM'S A MUSEUMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO MY QUESTION- IS BY INCLUDING THAT ORAL HISTORY AND NOW UNDERSTANDING THAT MANY OF THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES RETAIN THAT HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE THE ORAL TRADITIONS THAT HAVE GREATER WEIGHT AS FAR AS UNDERSTANDING THE CULTURAL IDENTITIES AND THE CULTURAL REMAINS THAT REMAIN IN YOUR ARCHIVES HAS THAT- EXPEDITE THE PROCESS BY. ENSURING THAT THE VOICE OF ELDERS AND HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE IS PART OF THE PROCESS. AGAIN CHAIR RAMOSE A VERY EXCELLENT EXCELLENT QUESTION AND ONE THAT HAS IT HAS REALLY IS AT THE HEART OF HOW. WE I THINK I'M SPEAKING FOR THE WHOLE UC SYSTEM HAVE DEEPLY RETHOUGHT AND RECONSIDERED OUR REPATRIATION. OF PROCESS THE DECISION PROCESS- IN THE PAST IN THE IN NOT WHAT I WOULDHOPE TO CHARACTERIZE AS DISTANT PAST- IT BUT IN THE PAST- THE SORT OF PROCESS WAS SET UP SO AS TO- PLACE HIGH VALUE ON RETAINING THESE ITEMS FOR SCIENTIFIC X. EXAMINATION AND RESEARCH. THIS IS NOT WHERE WE ARE TODAY OUR OVER ARCHING GOAL AND DESIRE IS TO REPATRIATE WERE POISED TO REPATRIATE WE WANT TO REPATRIATE WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO REPATRIATE AS QUICKLY AND AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. AS PART OF THAT A PROCESS WHICH REQUIRES JYJ AMOUNTS OF WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION SO SCIENTIFICALLY EVALUATED AND SO ON- IS A BURDEN TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND LEADS TO- I THINK STAND THE TIMELINE AND DELAY ASSOCIATED WITH NEW ABLE TO BOTH COLLECT THE INFORMATION AND THEN ACT UPON IT. ORAL YOU THE USE. OF ORAL TRADITION WE CAN WE CAN ENGAGE IN A CALL WITH- A NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND LISTEN TO THEIR ELDERS RECITE. THE ORAL TRADITION OF THE- YOU KNOW THE LAND- AND WHICH THESE THESE PARTICULAR ANCESTRY REMAINS- NAY HAVE BEEN FOUND AS BEING PART OF THE TRADITIONAL LANDS- FIVE PARTICULAR NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND SO ON. WE DON'T REQUIRE THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAILED DOCUMENTATION AND SO ON SO WE ARE PRIVILEGING WE ARE WAITING IN OUR DECISIONS THE TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE ORAL TRADITIONS AND SO ON WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR DELIBERATIONS ABOUT REPATRIATION AN AFFILIATION. AND WE ARE ARE REALLY SETTING AS OUR PRIORITY THAT WE WANT TO REPATRIATE OUR PRIORITY IS TO REPATRIATE NOT TO RETAIN. THESE ANCESTRAL REMAINS AND ITEMS FOR SCIENTIFIC STUDY THAT IS NO LONGER THE DESIRED GOAL OF THE UNIVERSITY TO HAVE THESE ITEMS UNDER ITS CARE OUR GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE AFFILIATED COMMUNITIES AND REPATRIATE. TO THOSE COMMUNITIES TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY WE CAN TO HAVE AS AS CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS SEES AS AS I CHILD PROCESSES SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND- THE ABILITY TO WAIT ORAL TRADITIONS. IS A DRAMATIC REDUCTION ON THE BURDEN TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES TO THE FACT THAT SO IT IS A WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL OF RAPID. AGILE REPATRIATION THANK YOU THANK YOU- FOR YOUR COMMENTS I HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS YOU KEPT MENTIONING- IN YOUR TESTIMONY LOST ITEMS CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE LOST ITEMS- MEANING. THERE'S A LOST ITEMS- REMAINS OF ANCESTORS OF CALIFORNIAN TRIBES THAT HAVE GONE MISSING. YES- YOU KNOW AGAIN- THIS IS THIS ISN'T AN ADMITTEDLY AN EMBARRASSMENT. FOR THE UNIVERSITY AND FOR ME PERSONALLY THAT THERE WERE ANCESTRAL REMAINS THAT- WE KNEW WERE IN OUR CARE. BUT WERE NOT WITHIN OUR MUSEUM SO THE QUESTION IS WHERE ARE THEY IN THIS IS DEEPLY TROUBLING DEEPLY TROUBLING- TO NOT HAVE AS ACCURATE 21100% ACCURATE INVENTORIES- THIS IS REQUIREMENTS WE MUST HAVE THIS. NOW I HAVE TO ADMIT AS PART OF THE PROCESS AS PART OF THE NEW POLICIES THE INTERIM POLICY WE COMMUNICATED TO OUR CAMPUS COMMUNITY- THE WORD WENT OUT THAT ALL ITEMS. OF THIS NATURE MUST BE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY ON OUR CAMPUS AND THIS WAS BROADLY COMMUNICATED AS PART OF THE NEW THE NEW SYSTEM ON POLICY. IN THE RESULT OF THAT IS THIS COMMUNICATION METHOD WORKED WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY- SOME ANCESTRAL REMAINS THAT WERE NOT IN THE MUSEUM WE WERE ABLE TO COLLECT THEM RETURN THEM TO THE MUSEUM AND ULTIMATELY RETURN THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE- DESCENDING COMMUNITY. BUT NEVERTHELESS THOSE ITEMS WERE NOT IN THE MUSEUM- AND SO- YOU KNOW THIS AGAIN AS I SAID BEFORE IS DEEPLY TROUBLING TROUBLING WE'VE UPDATED OUR INVENTORIES WE NOW HAVE A MUCH BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE BELIEVE IS UNDER OUR CARE BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THOSE ITEMS ARE- MY STAFF IT'S- YEAH THEY'RE HELPING ME OUT HERE. IT'S ABOUT ONE HALF OF 1% OF THE ITEMS- THAT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY SO IT'S A SMALL NUMBER. BUT IT'S ONE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO TRACK DOWN IN IMPROVE OUR INVENTORIES BUT WE DO THIS IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH A NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE- SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO MORE HARM. BY LOOKING FOR THINGS THEN THEN NOT NECESSARILY KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE I KNOW THAT SOUNDS SOUNDS A LITTLE STRANGE BUT- WE DO NOT WISH TO DISTURB. THE ANCESTRAL REMAINS THAT WE HAVE IN ORDER TO FIND IT MAY BE ON A MISSING ANCESTRAL BONE. OR SOME SUCH- YOU KNOW SOME ARE PART OF AN ANCESTRAL REMAINS- SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ADVANCING NOT TO SLOW ANYTHING DOWN IN NOT TO- YOU KNOW SORT OF MAKING EXCUSES BUT IN IN. VERY CULTURALLY SENSITIVE WAY OF WORKING WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO CORRECT AND UPDATE OUR INVENTORY TO GET TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. BUT IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD- AS WE GO FORWARD THANK YOU- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND REGARD ONE OF THOSE WHAT REMAINS REPRESENTS A PERSON REPRESENTS FAMILIES AND IN MANY CASES- SO I THINK EVEN IN TESTIMONY SHOWING- THAT PROPER RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S LOST RIGHT THERE'S EVEN AT AT HALF A PERCENT OF 1% OF THE MARKET THAT'S STILL A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF A MISSING. NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS THAT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO BE REPATRIATED BACK INTO THE GROUND AND SO IF WE COULD GET A LITTLE BIT MORE FOLLOW UP ON MORE DATA ON THE MISSING- ITEMS THAT CAN NO LONGER BE FOUND. BUT ALSO IF YOU COULD A ADDRESS- THAT THE TOPIC OF UNKNOWN RIGHT WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW IT IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE A CULTURAL AFFILIATION IS ARE THEY STILL MATT MISS CLASSIFYING. THOSE REMAINS TO GOING TO A- AN AREA OF UNKNOWN. SO IF I COULD- TRY TAKING ANSWER- THE FIRST POINT THAT THAT YOU RAISED- CHAIRMAN RAY MOST. I DO I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE ITEMS ARE IRREVOCABLY LOST- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IN ANY ANY SORT OF LARGE COLLECTION. THINK OF IT AS I MEAN IT'S NOT REALLY THE APPROPRIATE ANALOGY I I'M AND I AM TRYING TO BE VERY SENSITIVE HERE. BUT THINK OF IT ALONG THE LINES OF A- A FILE THAT HAS BEEN YOU KNOW A PIECE OF PAPER THAT HAS BEEN MIS FILED. I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE LOST FOREVER THAT OUR INVENTORY AND WHAT WE HAVE UNDER OUR CARE ARE NOT IN ONE FOUR ONE CORRESPONDENCE. BUT WERE WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT. IF WE SEARCHED WE COULD FIND IT. BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE SEARCH FOR THESE THINGS BECAUSE IN LOOKING FOR THESE THESE MESS MISSED ITEMS WE MIGHT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD SO WE NEED TO DO THIS IN A WAY WHICH IS VERY CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND IN COLLABORATION WITH THE TRIBES. AGAIN I AGREE WITH YOU- IT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE ITEMS AGAIN NOT NOT THE BEST TERMINOLOGY TO USE PERHAPS- IS IT BUT IS THERE'S A DESCENDANTS WHO WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THAT AND- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET OUR BOOKKEEPING IN ORDER IF. WE ARE ABLE TO FIND THESE ITEMS BUT IT I DON'T WANT YOU TO COME AWAY WITH THE THOUGHT OF. WILL NEVER FIND THEM THEY'RE GONE FOREVER EVER THERE IN OUR COLLECTION BUT WHERE EXACTLY IN OUR COLLECTION IS WHERE THE SORT OF MISSING ITEM ISSUE KIND OF COMES UP NOW THE OTHER THAT YOU RAISED IS ABOUT- THE CULTURAL AFFILIATION AND THE ISSUES OF THE HOW TO CLASSIFY THAT THOSE YOU KNOW TEN THOUSAND SETS OF HUMAN REMAINS- SUMMER CULTURALLY AFFILIATED SOME ARE. FOLLOWING KIND OF STRICT LEGAL TERMINOLOGY WERE DECIDED TO BE- NOT AFFILIATED UP WE'VE COMPLETELY CHANGED OUR APPROACH TO THIS- WE'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THINGS LIKE OF THAT THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW. WHERE WE ARE THESE ITEMS WHERE THESE READ- ANCESTRAL REMAINS WERE FOUND. AND IF THAT'S IN A TRADITIONAL TRIBAL LANDS LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT ARE THEY ARE THE REMAINS OF NATIVE AMERICANS ARE THEY REMAINS OF- SPANISH SETTLERS ARE THE REMAINS OF A EUROPEAN SETTLERS OF OTHER YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN DETERMINE FROM THE LOCATION FROM- THE WAY IN WHICH- THE DOCUMENTATION I'M ABOUT HOW THEY WERE THAT YOU KNOW SORT OF FOUND- IT IN IT IN THE GROUND OR IN IN THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY WERE FOUND. THAT WILL HELP US IDENTIFY THAT THEY ARE INDEED NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES AND BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CULTURAL- INFORMATION LIKE WORLD ORAL TRADITIONS ORAL HISTORIES THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND SO ON. WE DON'T NEED AN ARCHAEOLOGIST REPORT- TO BE ABLE TO- REASONABLY RENDERED DECISION THAT THE START OF OUR ANCESTORS OF OTHER NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SO. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH OUR COLLECTION AND RECAP CLASSIFYING IT BUT ARM ARM ARM HIGHEST PRIORITY IS TO JUST SORT OF ORGANIZE OUR OUT REACH TO THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR WHICH WE CAN DO A LARGE GROUP REPATRIATION. BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS TO ELIMINATE ARE ARE HANDLED HANDLING OF ANCESTOR WHO REMAINS IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. SO BY WORKING WITH THE ALONE A COMMUNITY OF WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW LOOK AT THOSE- ITEMS THAT ARE IN OUR COLLECTION THAT WERE WERE ACTUALLY FOUND IN THE BAY AREA COUNTIES AND USE THAT AS A BASIS- JUST. CLASSIFYING LARGE NUMBERS OF THOSE REMAINS AS BEING ANCESTRAL REMAINS OF NATIVE AMERICANS SO- LET ME TELL YOU IT IS IT OUR GOAL IS NOT TO LEAVE REMAINS UNCLASSIFIED OUR GOAL IS TO PRIORITIZE THAT PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAN MOST RAPIDLY REPATRIATE BUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT YOU KNOW THIS NEW WAITING- YOU KNOW- CULTURALLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION- ORAL TRADITIONS GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WE CAN GET TO A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF A OF IDENTIFIED- DELETED REMAINS- THEN WE HAVE TO. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO OR HAVE TRADITIONALLY DONE IN THE PAST WELL THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND THANK YOU- TO THE- PROVOST TOM FOR THE TESTIMONY TO BRING US UP TO DATE AND- WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE- WHAT PROGRESS- HEARING SO- CHAIR SALAS. ON THE OUTCOMES OF A LOT OF THESE- PENDING REQUIREMENTS THE THAT CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. BUT WE ALSO- NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE WAS A COMMENT THIS SAID IT'S A PROCESS VERSUS POLICY THE POLICY DRIVES THE PROCESS AND I THINK THE POLICY IS WHAT WE NEED TO GET TO. AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL FOR ALL UNIVERSITIES AND I'LL MAKE THE COMMENT AGAIN- THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE UC. SYSTEM WAS A SAMPLE POLLING OF UC SYSTEM UC CAMPUSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT WASN'T A HUNDRED PERCENT- IDENTIFY ALL THE REMAINS WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM BUT JUST THAT SAMPLE PAULINE OF THOSE UNIVERSITIES UNCOVERED AND COVERED MANY REMAINS AND WE'RE HEARING THAT THAT THERE'S A EFFORT TO IDENTIFY WHERE LOSS REMAINS ARE. BUT WE'VE ALSO HAVE HEARD FROM THE UC SYSTEM SOME UC'S HAVE DONE A- HAVE WORKED OUT A PROGRAM A POLICY THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO WORK. UC DAVIS WITHIN THE LAST YEAR STARTED TO REPATRIATE- TWO LOCAL TRIBES AND UC BERKELEY- I'M ENCOURAGED THAT IS FOLLOWING SUIT- TO THAT ALSO. BUT AGAIN IT TOOK A PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO ALLOW. ORAL TRADITIONS FROM NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND ONE THING THAT IS TRUE. THAT ALL THOSE REMAINS THAT ARE THE ARCHIVES OF THE UC SYSTEM AND DIFFERENT MUSEUMS UP THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE ONE THING THAT IS TRUE. IS THE OWNERSHIP OF THOSE REMAINS STAYS WITH THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES WHO'S ALWAYS REMAINS- AND ANCESTORS- ARE NEED TO BE REPATRIATED AND REBURY SO WHEN I THANK YOU FOR COMING FORWARD AND OFFERING TESTIMONY AND BEING TRUTHFUL ABOUT WHERE THE PROCESS IS. AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE URE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO BE A BRING TO- REALIZATION THE DAY THAT WE CAN REPAY PATRIOT ALL THESE REMAINS TO THE RIGHT FOR PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE UNITED STATES SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON OUR NEXT PRESENTER. IS CHAIRMAN LEO SISKIYOU OF THE TAICHI ACUPUNCTURE. YOUR QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN GENERAL MOTORS. TEMAS SALAS ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE YEAH MY NAME IS LEO CISCO I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE TEST YOUR GOOD PEOPLE AND WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE IN IMPLEMENTATION OF MACRA BY OUR TRIBE. AND WE DO LIKE MANY OTHER TRIBES SHARE THE FRUSTRATION OF THE EMPTY PROMISES RUN OUR TRIBE WE LIVE WHERE A LARGER PART OF THE OKAY GROUP OF THE OKAY LIVE WE LIVE NOW IN WHAT IS CALLED THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE TAXI DRIVER HIT FROM THE EARLY CALIFORNIA MALICIOUS AND WAS ABLE TO THE STATE AND THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ON ONE OF THE TRADITIONAL VILLAGES. THE TRIBE HAS A STRONG CONNECTION TO THE VALLEY. AND OUR ANCESTORS HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO THE PROTECTION AND REPRIEVE REPATRIATION OF YOUR GOOD ANCESTORS. FROM MANY INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING UC BERKELEY MY TRIBE HAS A LONG EXPERIENCE WITH THE ONGOING FAILURES OF THE UC NIAGARA REPATRIATION PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY WITH THE PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY AT UC BERKELEY WE MADE OUR FIRST REQUEST FOR NAGRA CONSULTATION ON AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND TWO. ON SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH TWO THOUSAND TO UC BERKELEY CENTER SANTA ROSA RANCHERIA THERE PUBLISHED INVENTORIES. ALL OF WHICH WERE CREATED WITHOUT THE REQUIRED CONSULTATION THERE WERE NO INVENTORIES FOR THE NORTHERN VALLEY OKAY DESPITE KNACK FOR BEING A PASSED A DECADE BEFORE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE WROTE A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR UC BERKELEY. TO RECEIVE A GRANT TO GET THEIR INVENTORIES IN ORDER AND HOPE IN IN GOOD FAITH THAT THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM WHAT COMPLY WITH MACRO OUR HOPE WAS THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM WOULD CREATE THEIR INVENTORIES WITH THE REQUIRED CONSULTATION. WITH THE TRIBES WHICH UNFORTUNATELY NEVER HAPPENED IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE REQUESTED REPATRIATION OF INDIVIDUALS FROM TWENTY THREE SITES IN KERN AND TULARE COUNTIES IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND FOR A NOTICE OF COMPLETION WAS PUBLISHED FOR FIVE KERN COUNTY SITES WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE CONSULTATION. ONE OF THOSE SITES WAS CURRENT FIFTY THREE. OF THE EIGHTY NINE BURIAL RECORDS FOR KERR FIFTY THREE. ONLY TWO OR CULTURAL AFFILIATED AND REPATRIATED TO THE CENTER OF THE RANCHERIA THE REMAINING EIGHTY SEVEN BURIALS WHICH WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THE VISUALS WERE ONLY RECENTLY PLACE ON THE CULTURALLY UNIDENTIFIABLE LIST AFTER YEARS OF SANTA ROSA REQUESTED THAT THEY BE PARTIALLY IDENTIFIED THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM MAY THEIR DENTURES DETERMINATION OF AFFILIATION WITHOUT CONSULTATION WITH TRIBES. WHICH LED TO THE MAJORITY OF THEIR SITES BEING DEEMED CULTURALLY UNIDENTIFIABLE WITH CLEAR PROVENANCE THEY WOULD PICK AND CHOOSE THE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION THAT THEY WOULD CONSIDER IN ORDER TO HOLD ON TO MANY COLLECTIONS AS THEY COULD ORAL TRADITION AND TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE WERE IGNORED ALMOST COMPLETELY THE ONLY SOURCES THEY WOULD USE FOR TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE OR THEIR ANTHROPOLOGIST NOT TRIBAL PEOPLE INSTEAD THEY USE THE LACK OF QUALIFIED EVIDENCE AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF EVIDENCE IF THERE ARE ANY STUDIES THAT SUGGEST THAT EARLIER GROUP. THESE THAT TO SUPPORT OUR LACK OF AFFILIATION FOR THE OKAY THE AS MICHAEL MORADO. WHO BELIEVE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN EARLIER BOOK ON SPEAKING GROUP PRIOR TO THE- KEPT MICHAEL HYPOTHESIZE THAT THIS CHANGE OCCURRED. ONE THOUSAND TO FIVE HUNDRED BC AROUND THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO THEY USE THIS LACK OF ARCHAEOLOGY COMPLETED IN THIS AREA TO SAY THAT ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE A SECURE TEMPORAL SEQUENCE FOR PREHISTORIC CULTURES OF THIS AREA THEREFORE THE REMAINS WILL BE DETERMINED TO BE CULTURALLY UNIDENTIFIABLE BECAUSE THEY INTENSELY LACK INFORMATION ALTHOUGH A LACK OF EVIDENCE COULD SELL LOGICAL IT IS APPLIED IN THE MOST IRRATIONAL WAYS FOR EXAMPLE FRESNO FORTY NINE IS THE TAXI VILLAGE. ARE YOU W. THE AREA OF THE KIT FOX THE BURNELL FAMILY CAME FROM THIS VILLAGE AND THEIR DESCENDANTS STILL LIVE ON THE RANCHERIA THE TRIBE HAS DOCUMENTATION OF THIS VILLAGE IT WAS RECORDED BY CLOVER GAIN AND JAY WERE LAW ALL OF WHOM WORKED FOR BERKELEY WHILE THEY GATHER THEIR INFORMATION. THE HUMOR LANDS REMAINS WERE COLLECTED BY HUGHES THE MASSEY IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE FOR BERKELEY AND USE A MASSIVE SERVER REPORT THEY SPOKE TO INDIANS OVER NOW WHO ACCORDING TO THE REPORT WAS THE LAST SURVIVING TETCHY INFORMANT FROM THIS VILLAGE THE HUMAN REMAINS WERE COLLECTED CAME FROM GORDON KANE'S COLLECTION THESE REMAINS WERE SO RECENT THAT WAS STILL ORGANIC MATERIALS AND GLASS BOTTLES WITH THE BURIALS AND YET THIS SITE WAS CONSIDERED CULTURALLY UNIDENTIFIABLE. BECAUSE IT LACKED ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE AND IT WAS NOT A CLEAR LINGUISTIC CONNECTION TO A CURRENT TRIED AGAIN BECAUSE ACCORDING TO MIKE MORADO THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AN EARLIER GROUP THAT EXISTED THREE THOUSAND YEARS PRIOR. BUT ORGANIC MATERIAL DOES NOT LAST THREE THOUSAND YEARS. NOR WERE THE GLASS BOTTLES DURING THAT TIME EITHER DESPITE ALL THIS THIS SITE REMAINS ON THE CULTURE AYE UNIDENTIFIABLE LIVES TO THIS DAY SANTA ROSA SARAH'S GREATEST CHALLENGE WITH THE UC KNACK FOR PROCESS TODAY INVOLVES THE KINGS COUNTY REMAINS THE PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY AT BERKELEY COULD NOT PRODUCE AN INVENTORY OF THE KINGS COUNTY REMAINS UNTIL TWO THOUSAND FIVE. THE AT EIGHT SITES AND TWENTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS FROM KINGS COUNTY. KINGS 1-478-910-1219 THE MAJORITY OF THESE SITES ARE WITHIN TEN MILES OF OUR RANCHERIA THEY'RE ALL RECORDED AND COLLECTED BY HOUSTON MASSEY IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE. ALL THE SITES ARE WITHIN TRADITIONAL TAXI TERRITORY ALL SIDES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO BE CULTURALLY UNIDENTIFIABLE AS PREVIOUSLY STATED THE CURRENT SHARIA WAS ESTABLISHED TO HIDE THE TAXI FROM THE EARLY CALIFORNIA MALICIOUS IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT ONE MELISSA RABBI CAPTAIN ANSWERING GATHERED UP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TAXI AND THE TUNA TWOS AND CHECKED INTO THE KINGS RIVER FARM RESERVATION KINGS ONE WAS ON MR ISRAEL IS PROPERTY HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY HUGHES AMASSING. THESE THREE MOUNTS WITH ATTACHING VILLAGE YOU'RE GONNA ONE OF THE LARGEST ALWAYS ON THE RANCHERIA THE THOMASES OUR FROM THIS VILLAGE YEAH THIS SITE IS DEEMED TO BE CULTURALLY UNIDENTIFIABLE. BY THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM. KINGS FOR WAS A VILLAGE OF THE WHOLE TIME WHICH IS THE ANCESTRAL HOME OF MADE SENSE OF THE TRIBES CISCO FAMILY. MYSELF INCLUDED MY FAMILY CAME FROM THE VILLAGE AND WAS RECORDED BY GAINING CLOVER FOR UC BERKELEY ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CLOSE KINSHIP UNDERSTANDING OF THE VILLAGE APARTMENTS ON. THIS SITE IS DEEMED TO BE CULTURALLY UNIDENTIFIABLE BY THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM FOR NIAGARA PURPOSES. KINGS KINGS SEVEN THROUGH TEN OR THE TAXI VILLAGE A GUY WAS LIKE YOU. THE RED WING BLACKBIRDS YOU HAVE THESE SITES ARE DEEMED CULTURALLY UNIDENTIFIABLE. THOSE RECORD AS APACHE VILLAGE BY GAME FOR BERKELEY KINGS TWELVE IS ATTACH ABILITY OF YOUR MAIL TO CATCH FISH BY HAND. AND WAS RECORDED BY CLOVER AND DREAM GAINES KISSED ME FOR BERKELEY UC BERKELEY DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CLOSELY A PHILLY OUR ANCESTORS BURIED THERE TO OUR TRIBE KINGS TEN WAS PREVIOUSLY CULTURALLY AFFILIATED AND REPATRIATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. HEARST MUSEUM STAFF CLOSELY AFFILIATE OF THE SITE TO THE TAXI DRIVER IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN CHEN Y. UCB REPATRIATION COMMITTEE CHAIR DENOUNCED THE CULTURE AFFILIATION RECOMMENDATION AFTER THAT THE FEVERS MUSEUM NECRO STAFF WAS RE ORGANIZED IN TIME PAST IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THE TRY FORMALLY REQUESTED REPATRIATION OF ALL KINGS COUNTY SITES WE PROVIDE ALL WE PROVIDE AN ORAL HISTORY TO CLOSELY AFFILIATE THESE ANCESTORS TO OUR MODERN DAY TRIED BUT WE WERE TOLD THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE EVIDENCE SPECIFICALLY ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF MORE CURRENT EXCAVATIONS. AS TRIBAL LINES OF EVIDENCE WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PHILLY THESE PEOPLE TO THE TAXI DRIVER AGAIN THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT TRAVEL KNOWLEDGE AND HISTORY OF OUR CONNECTION TO THESE ANCESTRAL VILLAGES. BECAUSE ARCHAEOLOGISTS COULD NOT AGREE ON A TIME OF OUR OCCUPATION OF THE REGION. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. AS A TRIBE REFUSED TO PROVIDE MORE ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE. THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM SENT US A LETTER STATING THAT WE WOULD PULL. ALL THE OTHER AFFILIATED STRIVE TO SEE THE SUPPORT SEE IF THEY SUPPORT OUR CLIENTS SANTA ROSA RENTERIA TOOK OUR CONCERNS TO NATIONAL MACRO BUT NOTHING WAS DONE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE TOOK A CONCERNS ABOUT UC BERKELEY TO A NATIONAL NECRO COMMITTEE MEETING BUT AGAIN NOTHING WAS DONE THE TRIBE PROVIDED AT THE POLITICAL REPORTS TO SUPPORT CLAIM TO THESE ANCESTORS. BUT AGAIN WE WERE DENIED BECAUSE THEY TRY FAILED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE DATING OF THESE REMAINS THAT JULY TWENTY THIRD TWO THOUSAND TWELVE LETTER THE TRIBE WAS TOLD THAT THE UC CONSIDER THIS MATTER CLOSED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE TRIBE REQUESTED THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF THE TWENTY FOUR TOUCH INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE TEN A LIBERAL. BASED UPON GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION DESPITE SIGNING FOR THE CERTIFIED LETTER THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM SAID THEY NEVER RECEIVED THE LETTER AND REFUSED TO ABIDE BY THE NINETY DAY TIME LIMIT FOR A RESPONSE LATER THEY DECIDED THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM NEEDED TO CONSULT WITH TWENTY TWO TRIBES WAS THEY FOUND ACTORS WEBSITE AS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATIES SIGNED A KINGS COUNTY BEFORE THE REPATRIATION COULD OCCUR HOWEVER. MANY OF THOSE TRIBES HAD NO CONNECTION TO KINGS COUNTY AT ALL THE TRY WORK FOR A YEAR AND A HALF TO THIS TO THIS VIEW THE SOUTHERN TRIBES CONNECTION TO THE TREATY SIGNED ON THE KING'S RIVER IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN NATIONAL MACRO SUPPORT THE REMOVAL OF THE SOUTHERN TRIBES FROM A LIST OF TRIBES CULTURALLY AFFILIATED WITH THE AREA IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM STATED THAT THE TRIBE HAD NEVER COMPLETED THE PAPERWORK TO CONSULT EVEN THE TRIBE THIS A LARGE CONSULTATION SANTA ROSA RENTERIA HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ME WITH EVERY SINGLE REQUEST TO TRY AND OBTAINMENT ATTAIN A SIGNATURE OF SUPPORT IT TOOK YEARS ONCE WE FINALLY RECEIVED THE LAST LETTER THE TRIBE REQUESTED A TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF OUR ANCESTORS AT WHICH POINT PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM SENT A LETTER STATING. THAT THE TRIBE HAD TO PROVE THAT WE ARE NATIVE AMERICANS NOW IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SANTA ROSA RANCHERIA ALONG WITH MANY OTHER TRIES WENT TO A MEETING WITH UC BERKELEY TO DISCUSS THE DISRESPECT OF ALL TRAVEL PEOPLE AT THE HANDS OF BERKELEY. THROUGH THEIR FAILURE WITH NAPA IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YOKA DELEGATES WENT TO MEET. WITH THE CHANCE TO REGARD THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH NIAGARA FINALLY IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE NOTICE OF AMATORY OF COMPLETION WAS PUBLISHED FOR THE KINGS COUNTY REMAINS THESE PEOPLE WERE NEVER CULTURALLY AFFILIATED TO THE OKAY OR DETACHING BUT THEY WERE FINALLY RETURNED. WHEN THE OKAY COALITION ARRIVE TO BRING THEIR ANCESTORS HOME. THEY WERE TOLD TO BRING THEIR OWN BOXES. AND PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM STAFF SKANDERBORG CODES IN FRONT OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE AT A GROCERY STORE AND THEIR PEOPLE OR SOMETHING MERCHANDISE IN ONE LESS DISGUSTING DISPLAY OF DISRESPECT NOW THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IN THE TRIBES ARE TOLD THAT IT WOULD TAKE A COUPLE HUNDRED MORE YEARS TO BE FULLY COMPLY WITH THE EXTRA THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE ACT WAS PASSED. WELL OVER THREE THOUSAND OF OUR PEOPLE. REMAIN IN THE UC BERKELEY STORAGE WE MUST ORK TOGETHER TO FIX THIS TERRIBLE TRAVESTY AND REQUIRE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH NIAGARA AND CAL KNACK FOR. NOW WHAT WE ARE AT OUR OUR PEOPLE ARE VERY TIRED OF HEARING THE INTO PROMISES WE WANT RESULTS. IN OUR PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT MERCHANDISE THEY'RE NOT ITEMS THEY'RE NOT PROPERTY THERE ARE ANCESTORS IN THE V. THEY DID THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR- YOUR HEARTFELT TESTIMONY IN IDENTIFYING- THE PROCESS THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF RELIES ON THE VERY PEOPLE WHO IS THOSE REMAINS BELONG TO AND THOSE ARE AREAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH THE COLLEAGUES HERE ARE ENCOURAGED TO FIX AND BALANCE IT OUT WE DID THAT WITH A BILL THAT BROUGHT ORAL TRADITION AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO EQUAL FOOTING. WITH THOSE AND MUSEUM DIRECTORS AND UC SYSTEM SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN AND IF YOU COULD- CHAIRMAN- HOW MANY YEARS IT TAKES TO GET THOSE REMAINS BACK FOR PROPER REPAIR. I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT TIMELINE BUT IT WAS IT WAS A VERY LONG TIME THANK YOU FOR THE YEARS YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT THE NON TACTIC YEAH. NOW I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT DATES ON THAT BUT IT WAS. IT WAS QUITE SOME TIME THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY COMMENTS. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. CHAIRMAN SALAS THANK YOU THANK YOU SERVICES GO FOR BEING HERE AND TESTIFYING TODAY GIVING US A CLEAR TIMELINE OF WHAT- TRIBES ARE GOING THROUGH WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO GET- REPATRIATE. TRYING TO GET THINGS REPATRIATED- THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO CONVEY TO THE UC SYSTEM AS WELL IS- THE FRUSTRATION THAT THIS BODY- FILLS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY FELT BY BY THE TRIBAL MEMBERS I BELIEVE NOT ONLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW THE YOU NEED TO PROVIDE MORE EVIDENCE I THINK YOU SAID IN TWENTY TEN. AND KIND OF GO TO CHAIRMAN ROBERTS IS- QUESTION AND BUT YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T RECEIVE A RANGE INTEL WAS A TWENTY. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN- BUT WHAT I WANT TO ASK IS YOU KNOW GIVEN THE TESTIMONY YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY HOWEVER YOUR INTERACTIONS BEEN THIS YEAR OUR SINCE THE OUT IT'S BEEN PUBLISHED WE'VE BEEN HOLDING THESE HEARINGS. HAVE YOU FOUND IT EASIER HAVE YOU FOUND A MORE DIFFICULT. I HAVE YOU FOUND THEM PUTTING UP MORE OBSTACLES LIKE THEY DID. IN THE PAST SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES- MOVING FORWARD WE FEEL THAT THE COMMUNICATION HAS REMAINED THE SAME. THE OBSTACLES STILL VERY MUCH EXIST. AND TO BE QUITE HONEST TO WHAT WE HEAR TODAY NO HE MAY NOT KNOW THE ENTIRE STORY OF HIS STAFF.

AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO- IT'S VERY HARD BECAUSE OTHER INDIVIDUALS- NON NAVY DO NOT UNDERSTAND. THE LOVE AND CARE THAT WE GIVE TO OUR ANCESTORS EVEN TODAY I HAVE SENT TO- NOTIFICATION TO THE UNIVERSITY OF BERKELEY THAT OCEAN WAS AVAILABLE AND- REQUESTED CONSULTATION I RECEIVED A CALL AND EMAIL FROM A DOCTOR TORAH. AND SAID THAT HE WOULD GOING TO BE LEAVING FOR- SOME TIME AND THAT HE WOULD CONTACT ME OR WE COULD GET IN CONTACT UPON HIS RETURN AND I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM THAT WAS IN MAY- I AM AWARE THAT THERE WERE REMAINS OF SEVEN OF OUR ANCESTORS. THAT WERE FOUND WITH THE AND ISABEL MEADOWS AB IN THE SOUTHERN AREA OF FROM MIAMI. TELL ME- WE HAD BEEN THANK WE AS THE MLB'S AVERAGE A BAD AREA M. THE MOST LIKELY DESCENDANTS AND DIDN'T HAVEANY CEREMONY AT AT BROKE TO LEAD TO RETURN THOSE ANCESTORS- BOB D. FORCED THREE BACKED OUT AND I BELIEVE THAT THOSE ANCESTORS ARE STILL IN BERKELEY AND HOPEFULLY CAN BE CONTACTED I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY COMMITTEE ON WE'D HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED. OF OR WE HAVE NOT BEEN ASSIGNED BY THE NATIVE COMMISSION TO WORK WITH BERKELEY- SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED THERE OR WHO IS REPRESENTING OUR AREA AND SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE NAME ALLOW ME THAT WE ARE ALL ONE GROUP. THERE THERE ARE MANY THERE ARE READ OF DIFFERENT TERRITORIES WHICH WE SUPPORT THE MORE WHAT I NEED THE- FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND THE I MODE SOON FROM THE LOWER LOWER- BAY AREA AND- THEN THERE IS ARI'S WITHIN MONTEREY COUNTY- ALL OF WHICH INCLUDES BIG SUR AND- OF MANY OTHER MODERATE AND- OF OTHER AREAS- WE WORKED- REUTERS TWO YEARS- WELL THAT WAS ACTUALLY MORE. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ARMY TRYING TO THE OF REPATRIATE AND BURY ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS AND WE'VE GIVEN AMY- PARCEL. OF TO BE BURIED ANCESTORS. ON THE LOWER PRESIDIO AND DINNER I COULD HAVE BEEN WAY OBVIOUS THE U. OKAY INSHA WHICH IS THE THE SAN ROSA TOUCH CABLE NOW CHU CHANCY TOTALLY RIVER AND THE SAN IN THAT SPENDING ISSUE MATH WHO IS ARE TRYING AND- IDENTIFIED AS THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THAT AREA- EVEN THOUGH- B. B. YOU KNOW I DID STATES GOVERNMENT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE US SO WE COULD NOT EVEN CLAIM OUR ANCESTORS WE NEEDED A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE TO CLAIM THEM. TO PICK THEM UP IN OUR ANCESTORS WERE SPREAD AROUND CALIFORNIA IT TOOK MUCH TIME FOR THE ARMY TO COLLECT THEM WE MET WITH THE PENTAGON WE BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVER THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE REALLY VERY ON EIGHT OF. ARMY BASE AND- WHEN I WAS ASKED WHY DO YOU WANT THEM BURIED ON MIAMI DADE I SAID I DON'T I WANT THEM BACK WITH OUR HOMELAND THE BASE IS ON OUR HOME PLANET AND- THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTAND THAT OF OUR HOMELAND AND THAT'S THE PRESIDIO ONE OF OUR LARGEST VERY BURIAL GROUND. AND THE DISRESPECT OF THE CITIES AND THE GOVERNMENT IN THAT AREA THAT DON'T WANT TO- WORK WITH THE TRIED OF ME REPATRIATE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME EVER AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE OUTPUT- POLLUTION- FOR STANDING WITH US WHICH MADE THAT POSSIBLE IS THAT WITH ALL FEDERAL- AND IT WAS EXTREMELY HARD LIKE I SAID IT TOOK YEARS. AND- AND WE- FINALLY DID VERY AND THE ARMY DID RECORDED BECAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST TIME EVER THEY HAD WORKED WITH TRYING TO END IN REPAIRING ON AN ARMY BASE- WE'VE WORKED WITH THE CITY OF MONTEREY- AND- THERE WERE ANCESTORS FOUNDED IN THE ROAD. AND WE WANT WE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THEM IN UNDER A LEAKING SEWER PIPE AND THE CITY DIDN'T WANT US TO MOVE THEM AND WE WORK WITH THE NATIVE HERITAGE COMMISSION AND LOCAL WE THAT. THEIR ATTORNEY ASSISTED AS AS WE WERE ASSIGNED AS THE MOST LIKELY DESCENDED. FOR A YEAR AND THE ONLY REASON WE WERE EVER ABLE TO BE MOVED DOWN SISTERS AND BURIED IT REBURY THEM WAS BECAUSE THE CITY CALLED UP ONE DAY AND SAID THAT THEY WERE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY TO HAVE STEEL PLATES COVERING THE OPENING. AND SO- WE WERE PROVIDED A SMALL AREA WITHIN A NATIVE OR NON CEMETERY THAT COULD BE- COULD BE VERY ALL ANCESTORS WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF MONTEREY WE'VE ALSO- COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF PACIFIC GROVE OR AS A NATIVE CEMETERY THAT WE ARE REPAIRING OUR ANCESTORS FROM THAT TRIBAL AREA AND WE HAVE WRITTEN AGREEMENTS THAT THAT THERE WILL BE NO PAYMENT TO THE TRIBE AS I MENTIONED OF THEIR MANY IN EQUITIES THAT WE DO NOT HAVE OF. COMPARED TO A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE WE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR THEM WE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE OPENING OF THE CLOSINGS TO BE VERY AYE ANCESTORS AND- WE- CONTINUOUSLY WORK AND THEY HAVE ASSISTED US. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BE VERY ALL THE CITY OF PACIFIC GROVE. I WANT THEM ON DISPLAY- LAST JANUARY- THE CITY OF MUSEUM- I HAD A MEETING WITH THEM I WENT TO THE MEETING NINE THE DIRECTOR AND THE ASSISTANT OF HAD RECEIVED THE APPROVAL TO TURN OVER ALL OF THE HUMAN REMAINS THAT OF COURSE FOR BURIAL- I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE TABLE AND I WAS SHOCKED. THAT THEY SAID WHEN DO YOU WANT THEM AND I SAID RIGHT NOW I'LL TAKE THEM BUT I'M IN MY CAR I'M NOT GIVING ANYBODY DIDN'T THE TIME TO CHANGE THEIR MONEY. UP SIGNED THE AGREEMENT THAT WE TOOK THEM WE HAD OTHER A LARGE BURIAL INVITED ALL OF OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS- COMPARED THE ANCESTORS AND- IT THE SAME TO SAY FROM ONE MEETING TO THE NEXT EVEN EVEN THOUGH WE SPOKE A LOT AND WE IDENTIFIED WHO WE WERE WE HOPE I HAVE NO PROBLEM NUVEEN WE ARE MY GREAT GRANDFATHER THOMAS ALTURAS MARANDA WAS IDENTIFIED BY C. EAT CALCIUM IN NINETEEN OH SIX AS THE ONLY FAMILY JIMENEZ WIFE OF AND EACH OF THEIR NATURE OF THE ESALEN AS THE MONTEREY BAND OF MONTEREY AT THE SERVER RANGE VIA AND PROVING THIS INFORMATION IS TO SAY WHO WE CAN RETURN OUR ANCESTORS ANNA ANYTIME WE HAVE ADDITIONAL BURIALS THE CITIES HAVE AGREED TO- OPEN UP. THE NEEDS AND ALLOW US TO THE ENDS THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM BOTH LIKE I SAID THAT WOULD IN MAY IN FEBRUARY I HAD AN ADDITIONAL BACK SURGERY AND HAVE NOT BEEN CONTACTED AGAIN I'VE SEEN PLENTY OF EMAILS- BUT NONE OF THEM REQUEST A CONSULTATION- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- WE PREPARED THOSE ANCESTORS FOR REBURIAL AND THERE WAS LIKE TEN TRIBES THAT WENT WITH ME- A REPRESENTATIVE FROM DIFFERENT TRIBES WE WHAT AT BERKELEY. OR THE BACKUP AND LYFT HOME FRIENDS- STUDY NINE LANGUAGES AND- WE ARE PREPARED THEM WITH GIFTS. AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE STILL THERE AND GOING INTO THE BASE. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO BE AMOUNT REMAINS THANK YOU CAN A KIND STOCK AND STACKS OF ARE VOTE BUT A AHEAD OF PAY AND. I LISTENING TO THE OTHERS ANOTHER BIT CONFUSED ON HOW THEY CANNOT ACT SOME OF REMAIN WHEN EACH SIDE IS AN THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE SO THAT THAT'S MANY THERE AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WE ARE RETURNING THOUSANDS TO BE ALONE AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT AREAS OF BALONEY SO IF THERE'S- SOME REMAINS THAT ARE ALONI BUT A MONTEREY COUNTY THAT YEAH YOU YOU SHOULD BE RETURNED TO MONTEREY COUNTY AND IF THEY'RE FROM SAN BENITO SANTA CRUZ RETURNED THERE AND THEN OF COURSE WE TRYING TO HE THE MORE MY NOMINATE- IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY- THIS IS HARD WORK THIS IS HARD WORK FOR WHAT I KNOW ON RECOGNIZED RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING WE DON'T HAVE THE WAY WHEN I WHEN I READ VERY. I WOULD BOARD VOTES MY MEETING IT'S ON MY OWN BONDS AS TO PREPARE BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE CAN DO IS THAT OUR ANCESTORS OUT OF THESE MUSEUM AND THE HARD PART IN WHEN YOU PICK THEM UP I NEED SEE THAT THEY'VE WRITTEN ON THESE PHONES THAT THEY I DON'T KNOW IF I AM WITH NUMBER THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK OF A N. M. IT'S WRONG A WE PRAY WE WISH THE THERE WAS A WAIT TAKE THESE NUMBERS OFF OF THE REMAINS OF OUR ANCESTORS BUT WE CAN'T BECAUSE THEN WE WOULD LOSE THAT MUCH MORE OF THE REMAIN SO WE NEED TO THEN HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BE VERY THOUSAND BUT THE NUMBER. IT'S IMPORTANT OF THAT ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS AB VERY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY IT'S A LOT OF WORK- WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE NATIVE HERITAGE COMMISSION IF THEY'VE SET UP A COMMITTEE OR COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO DETERMINE- WHOSE ANCESTORS THOUGH WHERE- I TRIED WE PRESENT OVER SIX HUNDRED TRIBAL MEMBERS. AND EACH OF THEM HAVE HAD THEIR GENEALOGY GROUP. AND WE ALL REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SHARE THAT WITH EVERYONE. OF WHERE WE COME FROM AND YET INDIVIDUALS THAT MY NAME ONLY AS A FAMILY ARE RECEIVING OUR ANCESTORS AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE MORE INFORMATION TODAY WAS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THAT THE NATIVE HERITAGE COMMISSION HAD ASSIGNED MEMBERS ORTIZ COMMITTEES THAT BERKELEY AND- I WILL BE CHECKING INTO THAT BECAUSE I NEED. I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ANCESTORS COME HOME GUARD ARE HOMELESS.

COMMUNITY COUNTY CITY THAT THERE'S INDIAN PEOPLE- THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ITS THOSE REMAINS THE STILL ARE IN ARCHIVES IS THOSE REMAINS THAT WE'RE HEARING HAVE BEEN MISCLASSIFIED OR EVEN LOST THEIR TRYING TO- RETREAT BUT EACH ONE OF THOSE REPRESENTS THE ANCESTORS OF OUR PEOPLE AND OUR BIGGEST JOB TOGETHER AS CALIFORNIA PEOPLE IS TO ENSURE THE REPATRIATION PROCESS MOVES FORWARD I WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN- REMEMBER AS FOR.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I THINK WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS REALLY A DESIRE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AMERICAN INDIAN PEOPLE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS ALIVE AND WELL AND THRIVING AND THAT OUR ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A FOR MANY YEARS NOW BEEN STEWART'S OF HOLDING ON TO- BOTH KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS ARTIFACTS THAT CLEARLY BELONGED TO SOVEREIGN PEOPLE- THERE IS THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR RESTITUTION. AND FOR THOSE ITEMS TO BE DELIVERED BACK TO THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY BELONG TO IT IS A LARGER CONVERSATION FOR NATIVE AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD IN WHICH WE SEE. THAT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN CLEARLY COLONIZED IN MANY WAYS HAVE HAD THEIR HISTORY REMOVED THEIR LANGUAGE REMOVED THEIR CULTURAL REMOVED. AND ARE NOW IN MUSEUMS. WELL COMMUNITIES ARE STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE AND THRIVING. AND SO I THINK WHAT WHAT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN OUR CONVERSATIONS HERE TODAY IS REALLY HOW WE RE CONCILIATOR HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. AND HOW WE INSURE THAT ARE INDIGENOUS AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AT LEAST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARSENE ACKNOWLEDGED FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY ARE TODAY. AND THAT THESE UNPRECEDENTED HEARINGS WHICH HAVE NEVER OCCURRED BEFORE IN OUR STATE LEGISLATURE IN IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. ARE SEEN AS AS IMPORTANT AS VALID AS A NEW DONE FOR WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN BE AND SHOULD BE. AND HOW WE RECOVER FROM OUR PAST AND I'M I'M SO GRATEFUL TO BE A PART OF THIS COMMITTEE AND TO HEAR THE POWERFUL TESTIMONIES TODAY. TO ENSURE THAT THE VOICES OF COMMUNITY ARE NOT ONLY PRESENT BUT HEARD. AND THAT OUR ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS DO THE RIGHT THING AND FOLLOW SUIT WELL WE ALL CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM. OBVIOUSLY HISTORY IN OUR PAST BUT THE WE CREATE A NEW AND BOLD FUTURE AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE AND I'M I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. IN ENSURING THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE RECORDED. IN OUR LEGISLATURE WHICH IS IMPORTANT THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN RECORDED BEFORE THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE NOT HAPPENED IN THIS BUILDING. AND I THINK THAT IS THE SHIFT. THAT WERE SEEN THAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE HEARINGS AND WHY THE TESTIMONIES TODAY ARE CRITICAL. AN AWFUL THE RESPONSIBILITY ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF UC BERKELEY AND OTHERS. TO ENSURE THAT. WHATEVER THEY HAVE WHATEVER IS BEING PETITIONED TO BE GIVEN BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS.
