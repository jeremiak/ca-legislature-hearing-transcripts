AND WITHOUT THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO HAVE IRAQ ON THE SPOT THANK YOU. YEAH. IT WITHOUT SAID WE HAVE ANOTHER MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUILAR CURRY HER PRESENT ON AB TWENTY THREE TEN. SO MEMBER WHEN YOU'RE READY GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MEMBER. AB TWENTY THREE TEN IS A TECHNICAL DISTRICT BILL THAT WILL MAKE A SMALL CHANGE IN CALPERS AUTHORITY TO ALLOW THEM TO IMPLEMENT EXISTING MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN NAPA COUNTY AND COUNTY EMPLOYEES. WITHOUT THIS CHANGE EIGHT TORTURED PROCESS OF VOTES THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS THREATENS EMPLOYEE PAY BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT. IN CAUSES ENORMOUS DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COUNTIES COST SHARING AGREEMENT WHICH IS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT'S ADJUSTED ANNUALLY. WE ARE WORKING WITH SEIU STATE COUNCIL TO ASSURE THAT THE PROCESS IS TRANSPARENT AND WILL REPORT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IF ANY FURTHER AMENDMENTS ARMY CORPS REQUIRED TO MEET THE GOAL. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT ARMANI RATIGAN AND HEATHER RUIZ FROM THE COUNTY OF NAPA. GORE. HI HEATHER RUIZ AND THE HR DIRECTOR FOR NAPA COUNTY. CHO SHARING IS AN ISSUE WHEN EMPLOYEES BEGIN TO PAY A PORTION OF THE EMPLOYER IDENTIFIED CALPERS CONTRIBUTION. NAPA COUNTY BARGAIN IMPLEMENTED AGREEMENTS WITH OUR UNIONS THAT INCLUDES A METHODOLOGY TO SHARE COST INCREASES A BETWEEN EMPLOYEES IN THE COUNTY THIS PRACTICE HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR ABOUT A DECADE. IT WASN'T UNTIL FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR WE STARTED THOSE SHARED COST INCREASES STARTED CAUSING EMPLOYEES TO PAY A PORTION OF THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION. SO THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THIS PROBLEM FOR US ACCORDING TO IMPLEMENT THE PROCESS. I JUST DESCRIBED ON COST SHARING REQUIRES THE CALPERS CONTRACT AMENDMENT. THAT'S A FOUR MONTH PROCESS. THAT REQUIRES US TO TAKE THREE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ACTION AND REQUIRES A VOTE OF OUR EMPLOYEES. THESE EMPLOYEES THAT ALREADY VOTED TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT THE MO YOU IN WHICH THIS LANGUAGE EXISTS SO IT FEELS LIKE A DUPLICATIVE EFFORT TO ASK THEM TO DO THAT. IT'S ALSO FOR US HAVE TO HAPPEN ANNUALLY BECAUSE OUR COST SHARING CHANGES ANNUALLY WITH CALPERS RATES. AND BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF THE AMENDMENT PROCESS AND THE TIMING OF OUR BARGAINING IT OFTEN OCCURS THE WERE UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE CALPERS AMENDMENT BY THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. WHAT THAT CREATES? BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE RATES CHANGE WITH THAT CREATES IS EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTIONS AIR OUT AND WHEN THE COUNTY TRIES TO REPORT THOSE TO CALPERS. AND SO THEREFORE EMPLOYEES AND UP WITH CONTRIBUTIONS AND SERVICE NOT BEING REPORTED ON THEIR ACCOUNT TIMELY. AND THE PROPOSED CHANGE BEFORE YOU WOULD MODIFY THE CALPERS LAW. TO RECOGNIZE OUR APPROVED AND WILL YOU LANGUAGE. FOR RATE CHANGES ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT FOR THAT EMPLOYEE ELECTION WHICH HELP STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR US. IT HONORS OUR BINDING AGREEMENTS WITH OUR UNIONS. BETWEEN COUNTY ANY UNION IT STREAMLINES THIS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS FOR THE COUNTY. AND I WOULD JUST DIE NEXT MOLLY RIGHT AGAIN AYE DEPUTY COUNTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR NAPA COUNTY HERE ON THE BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SUPPORT WOULD BE A STRONG WORD. WERE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR THEIR STAFF. FOR ACCOMMODATING SEIU CALIFORNIA'S CONCERNS ABOUT WE BELIEVE THERE'S PROBABLY A SWEET SPOT BETWEEN THE. NOT SURPRISINGLY CALPERS CUMBERSOME PROCESS AND NO NOTICE AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THAT'S BOTTON BELIEVE WILL BE A BLACK COMMISH THAT ACCOMPLISH THAT AS WE. MOVE FORWARD TECHIES.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. AB TWENTY THREE OH FIVE WILL CODIFY. THE EXISTING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES REACHED FIBRILLATION BORDER PURPOSE CASE. WHICH GIVES PER JURISDICTION OVER PEACE OFFICER EMPLOYER MUSICIAN. DISPUTES. AND NINETEEN NINETY NINE LEGISLATION INTRODUCED TO GET PER EXECUTIVE JURISDICTION OVER VIOLATIONS OF ANY ROADS ARE REGULATIONS BY LOCAL AGENCIES HOWEVER. EXCLUDED ANY ORGAN RICK RECOGNIZE THEM PLOY ORGANIZATIONS WHO REPRESENTS. PEACE OFFICERS AS RICH AS A RESULT PEACE OFFICER MUST MAKE THEIR DISPUTES TO SUPERIOR COURTS. SUPER COURTS ARE NOT ONLY BECAUSE SHE BUT THERE ARE ALSO NOT WELL EQUIPPED. TO COVER TO COVER LABOR CASES LIKE PER. AB TWENTY THREE A FIVE WILL GIVE SMALL POLICE OFFICER ORGANIZATIONS ABILITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. AGAINST UNFAIR PRACTICES. CONTRACT DISPUTES AND BAD FAITH BARGAINING. WITH ME TODAY IS QUITE PROFOUND QUESTIONS OF KEVIN MICKELSON PRESIDENT SEKHEMRE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES ASSOCIATION AND STRAIN OF ON LIVING ON BEHALF OF SPONSOR THEM MUCH OF THAT MEDICAL. I DON'T SEE MISTER LEVINE. ARE. I DON'T SEE THAT WE ARE OKAY. IT. MISTER CHAIR I'VE BEEN ALL TOMORROW I'M HERE FOR MISTER LEVINE. ALSO I HE'S STUCK IN COMMITTEE. NEXT DOOR SO WE WERE TOGETHER YASMINA COMING HERE ON HIS BEHALF BUT I'M. REPRESENTING THE ASSOCIATION ORANGE COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFFS THE LONG BEACH POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. AS WELL AS THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFFS. ASSOCIATION ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND OUR WITNESSES APPEARS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS KEVIN NICHOLSON I'M PRESIDENT OF THE SOCK MCCAIN IF THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AND A MEMBER OF THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE THE SECOND LARGEST LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY ASSOCIATION AND CLOSE TO THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS WE ARE PROUD SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY THREE OH FIVE. LAW ENFORCEMENT MY ASSOCIATION IN PARTICULAR FOR TOO LONG HAVE SEEN THE LABOR DISPUTES RANGING FROM UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES BREACHES OF CONTRACT OR BAD FAITH BARGAINING SENT TO SUPERIOR COURT. THIS IS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. AB TWENTY THREE OH FIVE SIMPLY CODIFIED A PURPOSE ASIAN FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHICH GIVES PER OF JURISDICTION OVER PEACE OFFICER EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS. THIS WILL CREATE CERTAINTY IN THAT LAW. THERE ARE FEW REASONS WE'RE SEEKING THE STATUTORY CHANGE FIRST PURSUING CLAIMS IN SUPERIOR COURT CAN BE TOO COSTLY. A SUPERIOR COURT FILING FOR LABOR DISPUTE CAN COST A PEACE OFFICER THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IT IS NOT RARE FOR THESE CASES TO INCUR COSTS UPWARDS OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHILE A SIMILAR FOUNDING EMPEROR. WOULD GENERALLY BE WELL UNDER FIVE THOUSAND. MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE ARE RELATIVELY SMALL WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHEN ONE OF THESE PEACE OFFICER ASSOCIATIONS ARE DECIDING WHETHER TO TAKE A CONTRACT DISPUTE TO COURT THE MERE COST OF THIS MUST BE CONSIDERED. AND MANY TIMES THESE CLAIMS ARE NOT TAKING THE COURT SOLELY DUE TO COST. THIS IS A THIS IS CREATING A DETERRENT BY DOING SO THIS GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND MANAGEMENT AND UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEE ASSOCIATIONS DO NOT HAVE THIS BURDEN BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF PERM. WHICH IS ABOUT WHICH IN MOST CASES IS NOT COST PROHIBITIVE. SECONDLY PURPOSE THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OVER UNFAIR LABOR CLAIMS BECAUSE THESE ARE ONLY TYPES OF CASES THEY HERE IN CONTRAST SUPERIOR COURTS COVERING NEARLY OUT OF SUBJECT MATTERS INCLUDING CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LITIGATION. THIS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE COURTS TO MAKE CONSISTENT FINDINGS ON ISSUES SUCH AS BAD FAITH BARGAINING. THESE CASES ARE COMPLEX AND UNIQUE TO THE LABOR MANAGEMENT RELATIONSHIPS. AB TWENTY THREE OH FIVE WILL ALLOW PEACE OFFICER ASSOCIATIONS TO DRAW FROM THE EXPERTISE OF PER AND GIVE THE SMALLER PEACE OFFICER UNIONS. THE ABILITY TO BEND DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES CONTRACT DISPUTES AND BAD FAITH BARGAINING BY REMOVING THE BARRIER OF EXCESSIVE COSTS. INCURRED BY THE COURTS. BASED ON THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. IS THERE ARE IS THERE ANY OTHER SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR JOSH WHAT'LL CHO WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES AND SUPPORT. APPOINTMENTS CHAIR RANGE FROM WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. VERY BROAD ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS WE HAVE. POLICE OFFICERS BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

CURRENTLY THE STATE BLOCKS A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM FOR REPORTING AND TRUCKING OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS BY THAT STATE AGENCIES. THIS BILL WERE CREDIT SYSTEM AND REQUIRE THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY OFFICER IN EACH STATE AGENCY. AND DEPARTMENT TO REPORT THE NUMBER OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS FILED. AND STUFF OUT AND RECEIVED BY THE STATE EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY PAID TO SETTLE A COMPLAINT. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES CALORIE CHART IN THE PART OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TO COLLECT INFORMATION. FROM STATE AGENCIES AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND PUBLIC.

MY UNION SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND REPRESENTS OVER NINETY SIX THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES I'M A REGISTERED NURSE AT RJ DONOVAN STATE PRISON AND I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN. NO EMPLOYEE SHOULD HAVE TO FACE DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE INCLUDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT YET THE SAD REALITY IS THAT MANY WOMEN ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE SUBJECTED TO THIS INAPPROPRIATE AND PERVERSE BEHAVIOR AT WORK. WE MUST ELIMINATE ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AND ESPECIALLY SEXUAL HARASSMENT BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOULD FEEL SAFE IN THEIR WORKPLACE. SEXUAL HARASSMENT WHICH IF LEFT UNCHECKED CAN LEAD TO AN ABUSIVE ENVIRONMENT WHERE PERPETRATOR IS PROTECTIVE. BUT THE EMPLOYEE IS NOT. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I AM A REGISTERED NURSE AT RJ DONOVAN PRISON IN SAN DIEGO BUT I'M ALSO A UNION STEWARD FOR SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND OVER THE YEARS I'VE HAD MANY MEMBERS COME TO ME FOR HELP BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED AT WORK. SOMETIMES I FEEL POWERLESS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT ANYONE IS BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THE MANDATORY REPORTING SYSTEM REQUIRED IN AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN WILL ASSIST THE STATE THE LEGISLATOR. AND THE PUBLIC WITH IDENTIFYING PATTERNS OF MISCONDUCT ACROSS THE STATE AGENCIES THROUGH CENTRALIZED SYSTEM FOR TRACKING COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. PREVENTING INDIVIDUALS FROM AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO MOVE THROUGH THE STATE SYSTEM UNDETECTED. BY TRACKING THESE COMPLAINTS IN A CENTRALIZED MANNER THE STATE CAN IDENTIFY PATTERSON VIEWS. PINPOINT WORKPLACE CULTURES THAT FOSTER INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR AND ASSESS GAPS IN TRAINING. WITH THIS INFORMATION WE BELIEVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN BE THE LEADER IN CREATING A MODEL OF A SAFE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT.

HELP YOUR INFORMED WE GOT. SOME ELSE PRESENT YOUR BILL AND. A GREAT HONOR TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THIS BILL IN FRONT OF. ONLY THE CHAIR. THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL. AB TWENTY FORTY EIGHT. SIMPLY HOLDS US TO THE SAME STANDARD. THAT WE EXPECT UP EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYER IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF US FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN IS A FUNDAMENTAL WORKPLACE RIGHT. IT IS A RIGHT THAT WE HAVE GRANTED. FEDERALLY TO ALL PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS.% IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES FOR PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES. FARMWORKERS AND NOW WHAT I'M ASKING TO CLOSE THE FINAL LOOPHOLE FOR OUR OWN MEMBERS. THIS INSTITUTION WAS ROCKED LAST YEAR. BY SCANDAL. AFTER SCANDAL. OF ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION. WE PACKED PAST ABUSES ABOUT WORKPLACE BULLYING AND WE'VE FOUND LIKE ANY WORKPLACE. WHERE THERE IS? AN IMBALANCE OF POWER. THAT WORKERS HAVE NO RECOURSE. THAT THEY HAVE NO ABILITY TO COME FORWARD IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. TO WORK TOGETHER TO CHANGE THEIR WORKPLACE. OFTEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE IN TERMS A PAY AND BENEFITS. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS. BUILDING WOULD AGREE THAT THEIR BENEFITS. ARE QUITE GOOD. HAVING COVER LABOR MOVEMENT I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN MUCH BETTER. THE PROBLEMS WITH PAYING WE'VE KNOWN THAT WE'VE TAKEN SOME STEPS TO ADDRESS PAY INEQUITIES BUT THERE'S STILL PROBLEMS. AND IT'S THERE'S NO UNIFORMITY THERE'S NO RIGHTS FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL WORKER. THERE SOME RULES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE APPLIED. AND AS A RESULT IT'S. SLIGHTLY UNFAIR. BUT WHAT'S MOST STRIKING. IF THERE'S A WORKPLACE CULTURE THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THE VERY WORKERS WHO ALLOW US TO DO OUR JOB. WHO REALLY ARE THE BACKBONE OF EVERYTHING WE DO? FOR THEM TO HAVE A VOICE IN THEIR OWN WORKPLACE. FOR THEM TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS THAT THEY SEE THAT EXIST. I APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF THE SPEAKER IN THE PRO TEM AND THE EFFORTS OF MEMBERS OF THIS BODY TO COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A JOINT COMMITTEE. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES WE'VE SEEN. BUT LET'S BE HONEST AND ANY OTHER WORKPLACE THAT WILL BE THE BOSS IS COMING TOGETHER WITH OUTSIDE EXPERTS. TO TELL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY FACING THESE ISSUES WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT WHAT WILL CORRECT CULTURE FOR THEM. THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIVE INPUT BY THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE VOICED THEIR CONCERNS. ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS BUILDING. ONE WAY TO SOLVE THAT IN FACT THE ONLY WAY I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY WORKPLACE TO SOLVE THAT. IS TO ALLOW WORKERS THE CHANCE. TO COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A COLLECTIVE VOICE. THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY THAT ANY MEMBER OF ANYBODY STAFF WILL BE IN A UNION. THAT IS A RIGHT THAT SHOULD AND WOULD ST WITH THE ACTUAL WORKERS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DEMAND OF EVERY OTHER EMPLOYER. WHAT THIS BILL DOES SIMPLY IS NOT ONLY FOR OUR STAFF? TELL THEM THAT WE RESPECT THEM ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT CHOICE ON THEIR OWN WITH OUT INTIMIDATION AND WITHOUT RETALIATION. BUT ALSO FOR THAT OTHER STAFF THAT ARE NOT OUR DIRECT STAFF WHO MAY ALSO HELP WORKPLACE GRIPES. WHETHER IT'S THE SERGEANTS TO DRIVE US AROUND WHETHER IT'S THE FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE CLERK'S OFFICE TO PROCESS OUR BILLS WHETHER IT'S ALLEGE COUNSEL WHO WRITE OUR BILLS. IT IS JUST A SIMPLE STATEMENT OF ALLOWING WORKERS. DOT RIGHT TO HAVE A VOICE IN TO SAY WE RESPECT THEM ENOUGH TO USE THAT VOICE RESPONSIBLY. IF THEY SO CHOOSE. THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES I KNOW IT SCARES PEOPLE. I'VE HAD VERY LITTLE HONEST INTERACTION WITH ANYBODY ABOUT THE OPPOSITION ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT EXIST. ONLY. AMONG THEIR OWN RANKS. IF A MEMBER WOULD LIKE TO COME FORWARD IN SUGGESTS TO ME LIKE ANY OTHER PROCESS SUGGESTED AS. AT LEAST ONE MEMBER HAS THAT WERE UNIQUE. WHERE SPECIAL? WHAT DIFFERENT WE DON'T NEED? A UNION IN THIS WORKPLACE. I CHALLENGE YOU TO SAY THAT PUBLIC BECAUSE EVERY BOSS THINKS THEY DON'T NEED A UNION IN THE WORKPLACE. AND IT IS THOSE BOSSES WHO VOICE AT THE LOUDEST THAT USUALLY MEET AT THE MOST. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR TODAY. I AM ASKING. FOR THE COURTESY OF MOVING A BILL FORWARD. THAT WOULD JUST CLEAR UP EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BUILDING. AND THAT WOULD SHOW OUR STAFF. THAT WE RESPECT THEM ENOUGH TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES. I HAVE A NUMBER OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU JUST MEMBERS JUST I HAVE TWO MINUTE LIMIT ON EVERYONE DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR AGENDA TODAY. SO WITH THAT WHO'D LIKE TO GO FIRST. AGO. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS BRIAN. HOT WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. APPEAR TODAY WEARING TWO HATS I'M AS A FORMER SENATE EMPLOYEE.

IT I AM I'M ALSO ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS FOR A PIZZA ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CAPITAL ASSOCIATION. AND THIS BILL IS THE VERY THIS BILL. TRIES TO ACCOMPLISH THE VERY THING THAT WE I WERE SET OUT TO DO WHEN WE WERE CREATING A PIZZA WE WERE CHINA JUST PROVIDE SOME KIND OF A SUPPORT NETWORK FOR STAFF. ON THE BILL AGAIN YOU KNOW IF IF IF MEMBERS CHOOSE TO. JOIN A UNION WHERE WHERE SIMPLY GIVING GRANTING THAT WENT WITH THAT ACCESS FOR THEM TO UNIONIZE ON ITS IT GO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN REPRESENTATION IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN PROTECTION. I KNOW THERE'S THAT MIGHT OUT THERE ABOUT JOIN UNIONS BUT. I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THREATEN THE UNION. BUT I WON'T AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE ON. PLENTY OF OTHER COLLEAGUES HERE BUT DOWN AGAIN THIS IS A THIS IS A VERY GOOD BILL. IT OUT GIVEN GIVEN AND GIVEN TODAY'S NATURE AND I STRONGLY URGE ARRIVAL THANK YOU. NEXT. SHARE MEMBERS KOBE BESIDE HIM WE HAVE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS. YOU KNOW. CAPTAIN BELIEVES THAT ALL OF OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN STATE SERVICE SHOULD HAVE CERTAIN PROTECTIONS THAT ARE DEFINED IN THIS BILL. SO WITH THAT I'LL SAY THAT IS MY CAT. NOW MINUTES SPEAK ON BEHALF AS A FORMER STAFFER. I WORKED IN THE CAPITAL. FROM NINETY SIX TO TWO THOUSAND ONE FOR INDIVIDUAL ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. AND I WAS NOT AS FORTUNATE AS BRIAN. TO HAVE YOU KNOW. PEOPLE THAT TREATED YOU ALWAYS WITH THE RESPECT. THAT YOU DESERVED. I WAS ASKED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TO SHORE FLORA. A MEMBERS. SPOUSE AROUND IN MY OWN CAR ON STATE TIME. GO TO MEMBERS HOUSE TAKE APART AND REASSEMBLE BED FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY PURCHASE SOMETHING. BABY SIT THEIR CHILD. ON STATE TIME. YEAH THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NO STAFF SHOULD EVER. BE ASKED TO DO. I WAS TO AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT THEN BUT WHEN I FINALLY DID BRING SOMETHING UP TO MY CHIEF OF STAFF. I WAS CONSEQUENTLY LET GO ABOUT A MONTH LATER GROUPS THE MEMBER EXCITED. THAT THEY WERE REORGANIZING. TURNED OUT TO BE A BLESSING BECAUSE I THEN WENT TO WORK FOR TWO SPEAKERS. SO IT FOR ME IT WORKED OUT IN THE END. BUT NOBODY SHOULD EVER HAVE TO DO THAT. AND NOBODY SHOULD BE PUT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY FEAR FOR THEIR TOP. SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU NEXT. MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS CLAYTON MEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME JUST ONE MINUTE I THINK HE ONLY TOOK ONE. I KNOW TWO WITNESSES BUT I THINK YOU ONLY TOOK ONE OF THE VERY QUICK. I WOULD SIMPLY SAY IF YOU LOOK THROUGH LABOR HISTORY ALMOST EVERY GROUP OF WORKERS WHEN THEY FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE THEIR WORK. ON STRONG OBJECTIONS THAT THIS PARTICULAR GROUP OF WORKERS COULDN'T UNIONIZE BECAUSE OF THE GREATER GOOD THAT POLICE OFFICER SHOULDN'T BE IN A UNION THAT FIREFIGHTER SHOULDN'T BE IN THE UNION THAT SOMEHOW THERE'S AN INHERENT CONFLICT. BETWEEN THOSE BASIC WORKPLACE RIGHTS AND BEING PART OF A AND HAVING A MISSION AND SERVING THE PUBLIC AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CONFLICT OUR POLICE ARE FIRE. OUR AND FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ARE STATE EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND COUNTRY. A ARE ABLE TO SERVE THEIR MISSION ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR BOSS DO THEIR JOB BE PROFESSIONAL ON AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC WHILE ALSO HAVING SOME MINIMAL PROTECTIONS. SOME DUE PROCESS RIGHTS ON AND SO WE SEE NO CONFLICT THAT SHOULD EXIST HERE A WE HAVE HEARD THESE ARGUMENTS EACH AND SEEN TOGETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT THAT REFLECTS THE NEEDS AND DEMANDS AND PRIORITIES OF THE PLACE THEY WORK FOR THOSE REASONS WERE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THINK ANYONE SUPPORT IT OR ON BEHALF OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF ALL OF THE WITNESSES THAT WERE HERE TODAY AND I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF. I TOO AM A FORMAL CAPITOL STAFFER AND HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS AND THIS INSTITUTION IN A WAY THAT'S BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL TO ME HOWEVER I WILL SAY THAT THE BALANCE OF POWER THAT WE REQUEST FROM EMPLOYERS ACROSS THE STATE. IS NECESSARY HERE AS WELL AND I THINK WE DID HEAR THAT THROUGH THE ME TOO MOVEMENT THROUGH SOME OF THE STORIES YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THAT THERE IS AND AND THERE IS AN INHERENT IMBALANCE OF POWER WHERE WORKERS DON'T FEEL. THAT THEY HAVE A VOICE TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS WHAT THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN ENHANCE THE INSTITUTION WITHIN ITSELF THIS BILLS SIMPLY ASK THAT WE GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO DO THAT. WE'VE ASKED MANY OF YOU ELECTED OFFICIALS TO REACH OUT TO SEVERAL EMPLOYERS ON OUR BEHALF TO ORGANIZE WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE FOR THE VERY SAME REASONS AND PUSH BACK THAT WE'RE GETTING HERE WE ASK THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN BE CONSISTENT IN OUR VALUES AND OUR MORALS. AND ALLOW THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN WITH CAPITAL STAFF. THANK YOU KNOW ONE OF SPORT. THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRIAN NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES ON MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN ARE OFTEN IN TERMS OF. THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDED ABOUT WHY THIS BILL IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT I WAS JUST SIMPLY SAY THAT THIS IS A TIME WHEN IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WORKERS. THROUGHOUT. EMPLOYMENT SECTORS HAVE THE ABILITY TO COME TOGETHER. AND AS MISS VEGA. MOST ELOQUENTLY POINTED OUT. PULL TOGETHER AND NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS THAT REPRESENT THE VALUES ARE AND THE PRIORITIES NOT ONLY OF THEMSELVES AS EMPLOYEES BUT OUT OF IT AS THE WORKPLACE AS. THE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTION AND HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL DOES GIVES THOSE WORKERS THAT OPPORTUNITY WOULD LIKE TO THANK. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND WHAT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE OF THE COMMITTEE. THINK ANYONE ELSE SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRISTY ABOUT MOM BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THIRTY THOUSAND PROUD STRONG UNION MEMBERS.

MANY LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEES ARE DRAWN TO PUBLIC SERVICE. I HAVE THE DESIRE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR STATE IN THE WORLD. ONCE HIRED EMPLOYEES SHOULD NOT FEEL POWERLESS ON THEIR JOB. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THIS INSTITUTION HAS NOT BEEN MODERNIZE SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TODAY. TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION. AND HOW WE NEED TO UPHOLD OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY IN OUR DUTY TO THE STATE. SO I WITHOUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING. THE BILL. TODAY THANK YOU. NOT THAT I MEMBERS LIKE TO CLOSE. I REALIZE THAT FOR VOTE TO TAKE PLACE THAT I NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. I WOULD I. RESPECTFULLY. ASK. THAT ONCE THE MOTION IS MADE THAT THE CHAIR MIGHT CONSIDER SECOND THAT MOTION. SO THAT WECAN HAVE A DISCUSSION AN HONEST DISCUSSION. ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PARTY. IT'S EASY. TO DISMISS A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE. BY SIMPLY NOT ALLOWING IT TO BE VOTED ON. IT WAS HARD TO GET THIS BILL HERE. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S PUSH BACK. BUT THAT'LL LET ALONE. TELUS WHEN THE INSTITUTION THE COMMITTEE ITSELF RESPONSIBLE. FOR PROTECTING OUR EMPLOYEES. IT'S UNWILLING TO HAVE AN OPEN AND HONEST DISCUSSION. ABOUT WHAT ROLE ARE VERY EMPLOYEES SHOULD PLAY IN THAT PROCESS. THAT SHOULD ALARM US ALL. ALL I'M ASKING FOR. IS WHAT WE ASK EVERY OTHER EMPLOYER TO DEAL. TO GIVE THEIR WORKERS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE THAT PLACE. I CANNOT IMAGINE THE HEIGHTS OF HYPOCRISY. THAT WE PUT OURSELVES THAT AND WHEN WE SAY WHAT IS GOOD FOR EVERYBODY ELSE IS NOT GOOD HERE IN THIS WORKPLACE. I RESPECT MY STAFF IN THE STAFF THAT WORK FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS BUILDING FAR TOO MUCH. TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN NOT COME TOGETHER AND MAKE A DECISION FOR THEMSELVES. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD HAVE A VOICE WHAT THAT BOY SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW IF THEY CHOSE TO THEY COULD COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. A CONTRACT. THAT DOES NOT PUT THIS INSTITUTION IN JEOPARDY. OUR WORKERS ARE HERE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN WHAT WE DO. ANY BELIEF. THAT IS THE RESULT OF THIS BILL THAT THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER AND ROOM THIS INSTITUTION. IS INSULTING. IT'S INSULTING TO WHAT THEY DO EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH OUT THOSE PARTS. IT'S INSULTING TO WHAT THEY DO TO KEEP US AN OFFICE. TO MAKE THE STATE RUN. AND TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT US. I AM ASKING TODAY FOR A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SHOW OUR EMPLOYEES. THAT AT LEAST WE RESPECT THEM AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK. PER SECOND. THANK YOU. IN WITH THAT MEMBER. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION THAT. WHEN BROUGHT UPON US AS LOOKING TO SUPPORT OUR STAFF MEMBERS HERE. I KNOW WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S OCCURRED SINCE LAST YEAR WITH THE ME TOO MOVEMENT I KNOW THERE'S BEEN FOLKS ARE YOU WORKING NOT SOME LEGISLATION. TO DROP HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THAT ANY EMPLOYER SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK THEIR CONSCIOUS ON WHAT THEY THINK AND FEEL. AS FAR AS WORKING IN THIS BUILDING. WHICH IS A VERY UNIQUE POSITION TO PUT A SEN ALWAYS SEE HERE IN THIS BUILDING. TO. GIVE THOSE EMPLOYEES THE RIGHTS. I THINK THAT IN ANY OTHER CASE. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BUT WITH THIS IT'S IT'S A VERY UNIQUE INSTITUTION RIGHT. A MEMBERS COME AND GO THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS AND I THINK OF THE WAY THE BUILDING THE STRUCTURE. AND OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. IT COMPOSED OF ISSUES WITH FOLKS RIGHT. ABU WITHOUT SAID I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO. A FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE. TO BE THEIR VOICE WHEN NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO. AND WITH THAT SAID. IT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT. IN TRYING TO DISCUSS OVER THE WEEKEND OVERSEE. TIMING WAS ALL SHORT WITH US THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT MORE QUESTIONS FOR ME MORE LESSON THAT I KNOW. OTHER MEMBERS AS WELL HAVE A LOT MORE CONCERNED TO QUESTIONS AND I THINK. SHORT TIME TO GET EVERYBODY ON BOARD IS VERY DIFFICULT THIS ISN'T THE ONLY BILL OBVIOUSLY THE WERE. A DISCUSSION TODAY. BUT WITHOUT SAID. ARE OBVIOUSLY COME FROM A HOUSEHOLD OF UNION EMPLOYEES AND OUR WORKERS AND. I MYSELF HAVE HELPED ORGANIZE AND THEN. MINISTRY AND EMPLOYS COMPANIES RIGHT. I DO NOT HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS BECAUSE THE FACT THAT I SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME MORE QUESTIONS MORE THAN. CONCERNS AND AND TRYING TO GET WRAP MYSELF AROUND THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT. I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND FOR HARDLY ABOUT IT. AND THAT IS WHY AG DIDN'T GIVE A RECOMMENDATION. I BELIEVE I CAN GIVE A SECOND TO THAT MOTION WHICH I WILL. AND. PUBLIC INTO SUPPORT THE BILL. AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ADDRESS ISSUES. THAT I SHOULD NOT BE. S. LEFT TODAY AS IS AND SHARE THOSE CONCERNS WITH SOME THE COLLEAGUES BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE THE NEED TO BE DISCUSSED.

ANYONE ELSE SPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAITLIN BAKER FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HERE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JIM LIGHTS REPRESENTING THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT DISTRICT. THE BART BOARD OF DIRECTORS JUST OPEN OPPOSE POSITION TO THE BILL ON THURSDAY OF LAST WEEK AND WE'RE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE OUR LETTER TO THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS JUST THIS WEEK. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE A ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER FOR ADMINISTRATION AT PART MICHAEL JONES AND CHIEF LABOR RELATIONS OFFICER MARTIN GRANT. TO SPEAK MORE ON THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE MY NAME IS MICHAEL JONES ON THE ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER OF ADMINISTRATION AT THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT DISTRICT. BART HAS ADOPTED AN OPPOSE POSITION ON ASSEMBLY BILL THREE ZERO THREE FOUR. WE BELIEVE A LOCAL SOLUTION TO OUR EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS IS PREFERABLE TO THIS BILL WHICH AS WRITTEN WILL RESULT IN LOSS OF LOCAL CONTROL FOR BOTH THE BARDEN PLOY ORGANIZATIONS. AS WELL AS THE BARD MORT OF DIRECTORS. THIS BILL WAS VERY RECENTLY GUT AND AMEND IT WITH NO PRIOR NOTIFICATION TO THE BART BOARD OF DIRECTORS NOR BART MANAGEMENT WHICH LEFT US WITH VERY LITTLE TIME TO DISCUSS ANY ISSUES WITH ASKED ME. WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT OUR LABOR RELATIONS ISSUES ARE BEST ADDRESSED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BAR AND ITS LABOR UNIONS HAVE RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO CONSTRUCTIVELY A COLLABORATIVE WE NEGOTIATE ISSUES. BY AGREEING TO CONTRACT EXTENSIONS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT LAST UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. AND JUST LAST MONTH WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT CLARIFYING CERTAIN SPECIAL PAY PROVISIONS IN THE UNION'S CBA. A WHICH RESULTED AND REPORTABLE COMPENSATION TO CALPERS. ALSO THE BART BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS CLEARLY EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO RESOLVE ANY OF THE ISSUES. I ASKED ME HOUSE. OUR BOARD HAS SCHEDULED A CLOSED DOOR SESSION IN ITS NEXT NEXT WEEK WEEKS MEETING TO ADDRESS LABOR MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND A FUTURE MEETING. OF THE BOARD BOARD LABOR NEGOTIATIONS SPECIAL REVIEW COMMITTEE WILL OCCUR AS WELL. AB THREE ZERO THREE FOUR WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON PART BY POTENTIALLY DELAYING FACILITATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ESSENTIAL PROJECTS. WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY CONCERN. NUMBER ONE THE MYERS MILIUS BROWN ACT WOULD REQUIRE FACT FINDING ON DISPUTED ISSUES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF BARGAINING WHICH INCLUDES SINGLE ISSUE DISPUTES. WE WOULD BE PREVENTED FROM NECESSARY UNILATERAL CHANGES TO WORKING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO ENGAGING IN THAT FACT FINDING PROCESS. A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE A POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS ARE AS FOLLOWS NUMBER ONE THE DISTRICT HAS THEY EXISTING CLASSIFICATION TITLED OPERATION SUPERVISOR LIAISON. ONE OF THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF THIS CLASSIFICATION IS TO PERFORM SAFETY MONITORING FOR WORK BEING DONE ON THE RAILROAD. WE RECENTLY BARGAIN SUCCESSFULLY WITH ASKED ME TO MODIFY WORKING CONDITIONS WHICH ALLOW THE DISTRICT TO HIRE AND OR PROMOTE APPROXIMATELY FORTY NEW EMPLOYEES INTO THIS CLASS. HOWEVER IF WE WERE UNDER THE M. MBA. THE BARGAINING UNIT COULD HAVE DISPUTED ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE BARGAIN. AND THEY COULD HAVE DELAYED THE HIGHER OF THOSE NEEDED ADDITIONAL PEOPLE OUGHT TO SAFELY RUN CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS ON THE ROAD. AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO PREVENT IT FROM MOVING FORWARD UNTIL THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RELATIONS BORE. OUT WOULD HAVE COMPLETED THE FACT FINDING WHICH WOULD HAVE DELAYED THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS. CURRENTLY BART HAS APPROXIMATELY THREE STE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OF HOME. THIRTY TWO HUNDRED ARE REPRESENTED BY ONE OF OUR FIVE UNIONS. FOUR OF THE FIVE UNIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE GOVERNED UNDER THE BARD ACT WHILE ONE OF THE UNITS OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. WHAT POTENTIALLY BE GOVERNED BY AN MBA FROM MID CONTRACT DISPUTES? AND UNDER THE BARD ACT AND THE M. MBA DURING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY OVERLAY TO EXISTING OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY UNDER THIS BILL BART LABOR COMPLIANCE COSTS COULD ESCALATE BY AS MUCH AS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. FOR THIS REASON BAR OPPOSES AB THREE ZERO THREE FOUR AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NOVO. THANK YOU MISTER. ANYONE ELSE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. BUT IN QUESTION LIKE MANY MEMBERS. SO WITH THAT SAID HOW WOULD YOU LIKE CLUBS CROPS ARE. THANKS FOR MOTIONS OUR MOTION. SECOND. SO WITH THAT WHICH ELECT CLIPS. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAID I WANT TO A STATE OF FOR THE RECORD AS WELL THAT WE ARE A COMMITTED TO ENGAGING WITH CONTINUE DIALOGUE AND STAKEHOLDERS. ACTUALLY TODAY. AS THOUGH WE WANT TO CONSIDER FOSTER THESE. CONVERSATIONS IN THE SPIRIT OF ENSURING THAT WE FINALLY ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF OUR AT THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN WITH RESPECT TO ASK FOR AB. THANK YOU WITH THAT IN WITH THAT I DO HAVE A HIGH RECOMMENDATION ON THIS IS WELL AND I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORK OPPOSITION ADDRESS SOME ISSUES. SO THAT SECRETARY LIKE COLOR. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS RODRIGUEZ AYE. RODRIGUEZ I ALLEN. BROUGH CERVANTES. CERVANTES AYE COOLEY. COOPER O'DONNELL. THE ALBION COLLEGE WE HAVE A BRING BACK THANK YOU THANK YOU SO WITH THAT SAID WE HAVE NO OTHER MEMBERS IN THE IN THE ROOM AS WE SPEAK. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND PRESENT ON MY BILL AB NINETEEN TWELVE LACKS THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER SAVANT IS PRETTY TAKE OVER BUT PRIOR TO THAT. JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT MY BILL A. B.. AB NINETEEN TWELVE THE COULD BE AN ERROR IN ONE OF THE REPORTS ALL HAVE STAFF LOOK INTO IT. EN. REVISED IT IF THE AIR IS FOUND SUCH ONE TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT FORGOTTEN PRESENTED THE BILL SO THAT MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN TWELVE LAST YEAR CALPERS REDUCE THE RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF ALMOST TWO HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. OF THE EAST SIDE YOU'RE A VALLEY HUMAN SERVICES CONSORTIUM AT AJP A. AFTER ITS SOURCE OF REVENUE WAS TERMINATED. THE JPA TERMINATE ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEES WAS A NEIGHBOR PAGE RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS DUE TO CALPERS AND BECAME INSOLVENT. IN RESPONSE TO CALPERS DEMAND FOR PAYMENT OF THE JP EIGHT OBLIGATIONS. THE CITIES OF AZUSA COVINA GLENDORA WEST COVINA THAT CREATED THE JPA MAINTAINED THAT THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE. SINCE PAYMENT FOR THE JP HAYES OBLIGATIONS. COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE JP OR CITIES AND WITHOUT NECESSARILY THIRTY. CALPERS WAS FORCED REDUCE THOSE JP RETIREES BENEFITS BY SIXTY THREE PERCENT. IN JUNE OF LAST YEAR WE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE DURING A JOINT HEARING OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT COMMITTEE. THERE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OTHER JP EIGHT THAT CURRENTLY CONTRACT WITH CALPERS. AND NUMEROUS OTHER OUTSIDE OF CALPERS WHERE THIS ISSUE COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. AB NINETEEN TWELVE WILL PROVIDE RETIREMENT SECURITY TO JP HAYES EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES BY REQUIRING JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY PROVISIONS IN CONTRACTS. BETWEEN J. P. A.'S AND RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. I'VE MET WITH SOME OF THE OPPONENTS TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS AND WILL BE AMENDED THE BILL TOWARDS REACHING COMMON GROUND. THE AMENDMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN PAGE THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN OF THE NOW LOSSES. WITH ME TODAY IS TERRY. PREGNANT OF SL YOU AND SANDY MESA WHO IS AFFECTED RETIREE OF THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY JPA AND OTHERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TERRY BRENNAN ON BEHALF S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA I LET ME APOLOGIZE FIRST THAT. SANDY MAYES SAYS NOT HERE USE ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED EMPLOYEES WHO HAD HER. RETIREMENT REDUCED BY. TO TO ONLY SIXTY PERCENT OF THE EXPECTED LEVEL SHE'S FOUND EMPLOYMENT WAS UNABLE TO JOIN US. BECAUSE OF HER HER NEW JOB. AND THE CHAIR. RIGHTFULLY POINTED OUT THIS CAME OUT OF A JOINT HEARING. BETWEEN THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE HEARINGS. WHO ED WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH OUR OPPOSITION THAT LEAGUE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES IN THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS? IN THE INTERVENING TIME TO TALK ABOUT. I HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE EVERYONE IN THOSE MEETINGS EXPRESSED. A DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. HOWEVER THE OPPOSITION'S BAND RELUCTANT. TO LOOK BACK AT THOSE AGENCIES THAT ARE ALREADY MEMBERS OF CALPERS THOSE JP HAYES. THAT ARE ALREADY CONTRACTING WITH CALPERS WHICH LEADS. TO SOME NEAR HUNDRED SEVENTY JP HAYES AND SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. AT RISK OF THE SAME FATE AS HE SANK APRIL EMPLOYEES. THE CHAIRS BILL HAS. ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS THIS AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO A COUPLE THE AMENDMENTS THAT CAME OUT OF THIS. ONE. WAYS TO CLEARLY DEFINE DEFINE THE OBLIGATIONS. THAT ARE LIABLE FOR HERE IS ONLY THE PENSION OBLIGATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEES NOT ALL THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE JPA MIGHT ENCUMBER OVER TIME. WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES ANY POTENTIAL OBLIGATION TO THE. COLLECTIVE OF MEMBERS OF THE JPA AND. THE SECOND AMENDMENT. REFRESH MY MEMORY MITCH BOLDEN. PLEASE. APPORTIONMENT YES WHICH IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT. IF YOU HAVE. TEN TWELVE FIFTEEN MEMBERS OF THE JPA THEY SHOULDN'T ALL REPORT THE ENTIRE LIABILITY SO THAT'S REPORTED FIFTEEN FOLD UNDER GAS BE. BUT LIKE AGENCIES CURRENTLY. CONTRACTING WITH CALPERS YOU CAN APPORTION THE LIABILITY AMOUNT AND THEREFORE GIVE A FAIR ASSESSMENT AS LONG AS THAT EQUALS A HUNDRED PERCENT. AND CALPERS HAS THE ABILITY TO GO BACK AND GET IT. AND FOR THAT REASON AND. WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION. AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO RESOLVE ANY ISSUES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DOCILE GOKU WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES AND SUPPORT. A CENTER PEROT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. BUT CHEN MEMBERS PACMAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIA SUCH AS ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS AND RETIRED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WELL. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED AS ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS MEASURE. MAX VERY CITY OF SAN CARLOS NOT POSITION. YOU WANT YOUR MEMBERS STAINED HUTCHINS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE WHILE WELL INTENDED AB NINETEEN TWELVE PLACES SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON LOCAL AGENCIES THAT. I IF ENACTED WOULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE A PUBLIC AGENCIES ABILITY DELIGHTS GPAS FOR REGIONAL SERVICES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AB NINETEEN TWELVE WOULD APPLY RETROACTIVELY AS WELL AS PROACTIVE PERSPECTIVE JOINED SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL RETIREMENT RELATED OBLIGATIONS. FOR CURRENT AND FORMER JPA MEMBER SINCE SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THAT JPA. SUCH AJ OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE ACTIVE EMPLOYEE NORMAL COST PENSIONS RETIREE UNFUNDED ACCRUED LIABILITIES AS WELL AS BOTH ACTIVE RETIREE HEALTH CARE AND OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT DOT THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR IS TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THE BELL TO RETIREMENT LIABILITIES ONLY BUT WE CANNOT OVERSTATE THE FACT THAT. RETIREMENT LIABILITIES ACCOUNT FOR IN THE STATE CURRENTLY A CHILDREN FORTY ONE BILLION FOR PENSION PLANS AND A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION FOR RETIREE HEALTHCARE COSTS SO IT IS NOT CERTAIN A SMALL NUMBER. SO MEASURE ALSO MANDATE THAT DEBATE THAT ANY CALIFORNIA BASE RETIREMENT AGENCIES TO EACH AGENCY WHO HAS ENTERED INTO A GPA. FOR ALL RELATED RETIREMENT COST PLUS ATTORNEY'S FEES. GP'S ARE STRUCTURALLY INDEPENDENT GOVERNING BODIES WHO MAKE HIRING DECISIONS QUICKLY BARGAIN INTO CONTRACTS ON THEIR OWN ACCORD. INTO MY BRICK TO ACTIVELY APPLYING DEBTS AND LIABILITIES TO EACH AGENCY WHO ENTERS INTO A GPA THERE ARE MAJOR CONCERNS THAT FOR SMALLER AGENCIES AB MAKING TROUBLE PUT THEM IN CONFLICT WITH ARTICLE SIXTEEN. SUBSECTION MAKING THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION THAT PROHIBITS AN AGENCY FROM OCCURRING DEBTS AND LIABILITIES. THAT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES THAT THEY GET MEDICARE WITHOUT ABOUT OF THE PEOPLE TO CENTURY LIKE IT'S SHOWING A BOND. WITHOUT THAT WITHOUT A VOTE FURTHER CAN BE ARGUED THAT THIS BILL FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES WOULD VIOLATE ARTICLE SIXTEEN SECTION SIX OF THE CONSTITUTION. WHICH PROHIBITS ANY AGENCY FOR GIVING OR LENDING PUBLIC FUNDS TO ANY PERSON. AB NINETEEN TWELVE ALSO ESTABLISHES AYE OPERATIONAL PAYMENTS AFTER THE GAS THE BOARD ARE REPORTING LIABILITIES. DE ANALYSIS AT NOTES THAT. REPORTING LIABILITIES WOULD. ONLY BE. ON A PORTION BASIS ARE HOWEVER JOINED SEVERAL LIABILITIES THAT. EXCUSE ME. OAK OAK. I I CAN AT ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER FOLKS WERE GIVEN A LOT MORE TIME BUT THAT'S THAT'S FINE I'LL LOOK AT AND CONTINUE. SO WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS THAT WHAT HAPPENED LA WORK SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN FORTUNATE THIS APPROACH IS ON HELP RETIREES OF LA WORKS. IT IS NOT SOLVE ITCH PROPERTIES FUTURE GPAS ARE AT RISK AND IS OUR HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK FOR THE SPONSORS AND RETIREMENT AGENCIES IN AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH. A. THANK YOU. BUT CHAIRED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DILLON GIVENS WITH CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LEVY CITIES AND WE HOPE THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PITCH OF THE EMPLOYEES AT THE. RETIREES HAVE THAT YOU SAN GABRIEL VALLEY HUMAN SERVICES CONSORTIUM. WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. UNFORTUNATELY NOT ONLY WITH THIS LEGISLATION NOT ASSIST THOSE EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FACT. BUT HAD THIS BEEN IN PLACE PRIOR TO TO THEIR DISSOLUTION. THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE LIKELY BEEN THE SAME A ADDITIONALLY AB NINETEEN TWELVE. WOULD RESULT IN EVEN MORE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES HAVING THE PENSIONS REDUCED AND LET'S LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH IT HOW HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN USING. EASTING GABRIEL'S EXAMPLE UNDER A. B. NINETEEN TWELVE. SO UNDER THIS LEGISLATION. THE GPA IN THAT THE MEMBER AGENCIESWOULD HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER TO SEE IF THE MEMBER AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO DIVIDE UP THE PROPORTIONAL LIABILITY FOR THE NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS. IN A CRUDE LIABILITY THE JPA THE FOR CITIES OF THE COUNTY WOULD LIKE WE SAID NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THAT LEVEL OF. OF RISKING GREAT LIE BILLY FROM JPA THAT'S COMPLETELY FUNDED BY A GRANT FUNDS. CALPERS WOULD HAVE. THINK GIVEN THE JPA THE OPTION OF PAYING THE NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT OR AMEND THE CONTRACT YOU SIGNED THE LIABILITY. UNFORTUNATELY WHILE CALPERS CAN AMEND THE CONTRACT WITH GPA. THEY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AMEND THE CONTRACT YOU SIGNED THE LIABILITIES MEMBER AGENCIES WHICH ARE NOT PARTY TO THE CONTRACT. I THE JPA WOULD THEN BE ON THE HOOK FOR THE IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF THE TERMINATED AGENCY POOL OF NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS. DID YOU KNOW THEY COULDN'T PAY AND THE CONTRACT WAS TERMINATED WITH A WITH A GPA AND THE JP WAS DISSOLVED. THEN CALPERS AS A RESULT OF THIS LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT REDUCE THAT PENSION BENEFITS. OF THE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES AND SUE THE MEMBER AGENCIES TO TRY TO RECOVER THE MONEY. THE MEMBER AGENCIES WHO OF WITH THAT WITH THE LAWSUIT BECAUSE THEY NEVER AGREED TO ACCEPT A LIABILITY FOR THE EMPLOYEES THAT WERE NOT THEIRS. THE OUTCOME IS THE EXACT SAME ONLY CALPERS HAS LESS OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM TO REDUCE THE EMPLOYEE PENSIONS A THAT PITCHER REDUCTIONS. NOW IF WE APPLY THAT NINETEEN TWELVE TO EVERY GPA INSTEAD OF IT ENSURING THE PENSION OF GPA EMPLOYEES. THIS BILL PUTS THEIR PENSIONS AT GREATER RISK. WHEN MEMBER AGENCIES WERE NEVER PART OF THE CONTRACT CALPERS REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE LIABILITY FOR THE EMPLOYEES. THAT YOU THEY DO NOT MANAGE OR NEGOTIATE OVER THEIR BENEFIT LEVELS GPAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL BE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN. WHEN THEY RECEIVE IN THE ENORMOUS BILL FROM CALPERS WITH THE FORCED TERMINATION OF THEIR CONTRACTS. THIS BILL WILL RESULT IN UNNECESSARY REDUCTION IN PUBLIC EMPLOYEE PENSIONS AND REDUCTION OF SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC. FOR THESE REASONS REST FOR YOU KNOW VOTE. MADAM CHAIR ANTHONY CAN SOLVE US I REPRESENT VARIOUS CITIES THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THE SPELL. I HAPPEN TO ACTUALLY DO SOME WORK FOR LA WORKS. AND THERE WAS AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT CAT. THERE WAS A NONPROFIT NOW LAKE COUNTY THAT WAS CAUGHT DOING FRAUD. WITH THEIR BILLINGS WITH THE LA COUNTY. UNFORTUNATELY LA WORKS ACTUALLY DID. A ACCOUNTING AIR. AND WE HELPED SET P MEETINGS WITH SOME OF THE SUPERVISORS THAT BE ABLE TO FIX THAT ACCOUNTING THERE. BUT ONE SUPERVISOR WAS VERY CLOSE TO THIS NONPROFIT THAT LOST THEIR CONTRACT. AND THAT SUPERVISOR INSISTED. BET THEY PUNISH LA WORKS IT WAS A POLITICAL MOVE IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT YEARS THAT LA WORKS WAS AN OPERATION OF ONE ALL THESE AWARDS TAKING CARE OF DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN. AND KIDS. GIVING THEM THE GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. TRAIN THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT AND DON'T A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND LA COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTY. AND BECAUSE OF A POLITICAL MOVE THEY PUT LA WORKS OUT OF BUSINESS. EVEN THOUGH THE UNION. THE EMPLOYEES. SHOWED UP AT THE BOARD MEETING SAID OUR JOBS ARE ON THE LINE. THAT'S THE ONLY INCIDENT I KNOW OF IN THE STATE AND. WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THE TRY AND NARROW THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. BUT THERE'S NO OTHER JPA THAT I'M.
