SERVICES TO THE REAL LINE USE.

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:19.951
THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.052
LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THE

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.654

THIS FUNDING. THE LEGISLATURE

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:33.231
MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TWO THINGS

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:34.366
. THE FIRST IS THAT IN RECENT

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:35.333
YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.369

. AND THIS HAS LED TO NEWLY

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.441
CONSTRUCTED BED SPACE SOME

00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:46.211
REPAIRS THAT- ARE ONLY RECENTLY

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:48.146
COMING ON LINE. IS NEWLY

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:49.981
CONSTRUCTED SPACES MAY BE BETTER

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:52.717
CONDITION AND MORE CONDUCIVE FOR

00:25:52.784 --> 00:25:54.886
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. THE

00:25:54.953 --> 00:25:57.155
SECOND ONE IS THAT COUNTIES HAVE

00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:58.290
THE ABILITY TO CONTRACT WITH

00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:00.025
EACH OTHER FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE

00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:02.093
FOR NEEDS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.764
SOME COUNTIES MAN FACILITY NEEDS

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.699
. HOWEVER THEY MAY BE ABLE TO

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:10.001
PARTNER WITH A DIFFERENT COUNTY

OVER TO SOME DEGREE. THE

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.418
QUESTION IN MY MIND AND BELIEVE

ME I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE

00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:32.123
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN. BONNIES IN

COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HAVE A

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:42.733
DIFFERENT CHALLENGE YOU KNOW

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.534
BASED ON MY OWN BACKGROUND OF

00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:46.837
LOCAL GOVERNMENT- THE PARTY UP

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:48.606

ALL YOU HAVE BEEN TO INDIVIDUAL

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:56.047
ASSESSMENT. IN IN THE NEED FOR

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:57.748
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. IN

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:59.684
OTHER RESOURCES AND I'M JUST

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:03.054
WONDERING IF I DON'T KNOW IF

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.322
THIS IS A QUESTION FOR. DIRECTOR

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:07.358
SIR OR- MISS HOWARD- WHICH OF

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:11.696
YOU. BY AT WHAT POINT DO WE

00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:13.864
START LOOKING AT FURTHER

00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:17.668
DIRECTING. THE FACILITIES

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:20.605
DOLLARS WITH REFERENCE TO THE

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:23.441
POLICY AROUND. THOSE THINGS

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:25.676
INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT AND MENTAL

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.445
HEALTH TREATMENT I MEAN THERE'S

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:29.847
IN A- JUST. WHO THAT'S THE

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:32.283
QUESTION I WILL TELEGRAPH MY

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.018
OPINION WHICH IS THAT MENTAL

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.386
HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITY SHOULD

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:36.187
BE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:37.855
FACILITIES AND JAIL SHOULD BE

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:40.925
JAILS- AND IN THE TWO SHOULD NOT

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:44.095
BE- CONFLATED EVEN THOUGH WE'VE

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:46.597
DONE THAT FOR. A COUPLE THOUSAND

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:48.733
YEARS- IN WESTERN CIVILIZATION

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:50.067
AND SO I'M I'M VERY MUCH

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:51.235
INTERESTED IN SEPARATING THOSE

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:53.704
TWO- BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT

00:37:53.771 --> 00:38:02.580
YOUR THOUGHTS ARE GOING FORWARD. FOR YOU TO ASSUME THAT THE

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:04.081
SENATOR. BUT DIRECTOR ZERO I

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:06.851
GUESS I CAN START WITH HER AND-

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:10.054
LET HER REFER TO SOMEBODY ELSE

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:12.657
SO SHE WANTS TO. THANKYOU

00:38:12.723 --> 00:38:17.695
SENATOR CORTESE FOR- YEAH KIND

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:22.066
OF ELEVATING THAT ISSUE- YOU'RE

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:24.602
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT- I THINK

00:38:24.669 --> 00:38:26.437
THAT THE PROGRAM BEING THE

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.806
MENTAL HEALTH APPROACHES THE

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.508
GENDER RESPONSIVE CULTURAL

00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:32.476
CHARLIE RESPONSIVE APPROACHES

00:38:32.543 --> 00:38:35.413
ARE CRITICAL- BUT I THINK WHAT

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.181
WHAT IS ALSO HISTORICALLY BEEN

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:39.216
TRUE IS THAT THE LOCAL JUVENILE

00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:42.620
DETENTION FACILITIES ARE NOT-

00:38:42.687 --> 00:38:44.955
MORE CONCEIVED AS THERAPEUTIC

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:47.591
LOCATIONS. AND WHAT WE KNOW

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:52.296
ABOUT- ARE YOU- IS THAT MANY OF

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:54.565
THEM WILL BE SPENDING.

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:58.002
UNFORTUNATELY YEARS- DEPENDING

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:00.371
ON WHAT WE ULTIMATELY AFTER AS

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:01.872
FAR AS THAT THAT COMMITMENT

00:39:01.939 --> 00:39:04.375
MATRIX BUT THERE IT IS POSSIBLE

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:06.243
THAT SOME OF THE DEEPER AND

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.446
HIGHER AND- PUBLIC SAFETY YOU

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:12.383
WILL NEED TO BE IN A FACILITY

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.386
FOR. AND UNDER AND- THESE

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:17.321
DETENTION FACILITIES OR

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:21.292
DEVELOPED. IN THAT REGARD AND

00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:22.126
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING INTO THIS

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:25.362
LOCAL APPROACH WE WANT WE WANT

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:27.364
FACILITIES THAT HAVE FAMILY

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:30.501
ENGAGEMENT. PLACED PLACES WE

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:32.403
WANT ARE YOU PARENTING USE TO

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.605
HAVE MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:36.707
WITH THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE OUR

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:38.375
YOUTH WILL BE RE ENTERING AND RE

00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:40.745
ENTRY WILL BE PLANNED FOR FROM

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:43.681
DAY ONE IN OUR PAST DISABILITY.

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:45.149
AND I THINK WHAT WHAT WE CAN

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:47.818
LOOK TOWARDS ALSO ULTIMATELY IS

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.420
WHAT KIND OF STEP DOWN

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:51.021
PROGRAMMING THERE WILL BE

00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:53.390
BECAUSE I'M THINKING THAT. THE

00:39:53.457 --> 00:39:56.327
NEED FOR THAT WHOLE OPERATION

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:59.330
FROM SOCIETY AND- I'M HOPING

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:00.564
THAT BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE GOOD

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:03.200
PROGRAMMING THAT THAT WON'T BE

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:07.471
LIKE THE- THAT- FOR EXAMPLE AS

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:08.305
YOU KNOW IN OUR OWN COUNTY

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:10.441
SENATOR CORTESE WE HAD. BOTH

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:11.575
TENSION HAS BEEN AROUND

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:14.411
VISIBILITY BUT EVEN THAT EVEN

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:16.280
THE STEP DOWN FACILITIES ARE

00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:21.352
GOING TO NEED- MORE THEY'RE

00:40:21.418 --> 00:40:23.821
GONNA AT ARCHITECTURAL IN OUR

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:26.791
OWN COUNTY THE WINDOWS NEED TO

00:40:26.857 --> 00:40:30.060
BE CHANGED BECAUSE OF HIGH RISK

00:40:30.127 --> 00:40:32.263
. YOU PLAY SPENT DEFINITIONS

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:35.566
VERSUS MEDIUM REST- FENCING AND

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:37.668
SOME OF THE COUNTIES WILL HAVE

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:40.738
TO BE CHANGED OR UPGRADED SO I

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:42.873
THINK IT'S BOTH. I THINK I THINK

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.441
WE WANT OUR DEEPEST HAVE

00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:46.811
CONFIDENCE THAT THEY DON'T NEED

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:48.846
TO FILE TRANSFER MOTIONS FOR

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:50.080
EVERY SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR

00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:51.982
OLD. AND THAT CONFIDENCE IS

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:54.718
BUILT WHEN WE HAVE MEANINGFUL

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:58.989
PLACES FOR YOU TO BE. NOT AND

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:01.592

UNDERGO REALLY IMPORTANT TRAIN

00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:08.199

THAT WE'RE HAVE ARE USED AND

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:17.107

WHAT IS NEEDED WHEN- A YOUNG

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:59.677
PERCENT COMES IN CONTACT WITH

THE JUVENILE SYSTEM BOB SO JUST

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.049
TO QUICK THOUGHTS I THINK I

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:06.850
REALLY WANT TO- UNDERSCORE THE

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:08.719
POINT THE DIRECTOR THE CERRO

00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:10.054

INTENDED TO. BETTER SUPPORT THE

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.925
WHOLE CAN YOU ONE OF CARE THE

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:16.827
COUNTIES NEED TO HAVE AVAILABLE

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:19.063
SO SOME OF THE FINDING MAY

00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:21.565
INDEED BE GOING TO SUPPORT ON

SECURE USE TREATMENT FACILITIES

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.635

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:26.337
CORTESE CERTAINLY THE

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:28.605
LEGISLATURE MATE WITH AND THEY

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.559
SMALL LIMIT. THAT SERVES LESS

MORE INSTITUTIONS TOGETHER TO

ANNUALLY. AGAIN IT'S- THE

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:53.480
SAVINGS WAS THERE ON A ONE TIME

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:54.614
BASIS TO DO THE PILOT PROGRAMS.
