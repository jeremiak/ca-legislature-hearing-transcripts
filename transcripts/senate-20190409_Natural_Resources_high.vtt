00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:25.017
WHERE IS THE SCIENCE TO JUSTIFY

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.451
THAT THESE?

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:28.086
ENHANCEMENTS WILL PROVE THE

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:35.293
METRICS THAT WILL ACHIEVE THAT

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.330
AND A DESIRE GOAL.

00:21:38.397 --> 00:21:39.197
I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:41.299
SCIENCE AND IT'S A VERY -- BROAD

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:42.701
QUESTION I'LL.

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:43.502
ASK OF EITHER MY WITNESSES WANT

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:44.169
TO COMMENT ON THAT BUT THAT THAT

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:45.504
ENCOMPASSES A LOT OF DIFFERENT --

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.672
IN AND IT WON'T LET ME LET ME

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:47.572
REFINE IT A BIT -- I HADN'T SEEN

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:48.440
IN THE MATERIALS THAT I'VE COME

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:50.842
ACROSS -- IS THIS.

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:53.111
INDUSTRY SOME ASSUMED AND

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:58.383
APPRECIATED -- IMPROVEMENTS THAT

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.652
WOULD ACHIEVE THE DESIRED GOAL.

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:01.186
I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:01.453
SENATOR.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.754
THE THE ANSWER THE SHORT ANSWER

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:05.023
IS YES THERE'S A WEALTH OF

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.858
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE PRODUCED

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:09.294
BY AGENCIES AS WELL AS ACADEMICS

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:11.797
THAT DEMONSTRATE UNEQUIVOCALLY

00:22:11.863 --> 00:22:12.431
THAT.

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:14.132
THE KINDS OF FOREST PRACTICE

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:16.334
CHANGES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN SB

00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:17.636
SIXTY NINE WOULD PROVIDE WATER

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:20.005
QUALITY BENEFITS AND FISHERIES

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:21.373
PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCE BENEFITS

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.242
OF THOSE THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES.

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:26.178
EXIST WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:28.246
AGGREGATING THEM AND WE'RE GOING

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.981
TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH.

00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:31.650
WITH THE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:32.517
RAISED THEIR OPPOSITION IN THE

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:34.953
PAST THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.254
WILL CONTINUE SIR AND I

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:37.956
APPRECIATE IT AND THAT'S I THINK

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:40.125
THAT'S WHERE I MY I'M ULTIMATELY

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.194
LEANING IS THIS IDEA THAT MAYBE

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.428
WE SHOULD.

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:46.865
AGGREGATE THAT MATERIAL AND HAVE

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:47.799
THESE CONVERSATIONS.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:50.268
EARLIER THAN IN ITS FINAL FORM

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:52.070
OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR ITS

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:53.872
INTRODUCTORY FORM OF PROPOSED

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:55.107
LEGISLATION.

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:56.775
I REPRESENT -- AREAS WHERE

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:58.744
THERE'S A LOT OF TIMBER A LOT OF

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.412
FORESTRY -- BECAUSE OF ALL THE

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:02.814
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF OF MY AREA

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:04.716
SO NATURALLY YOU KNOW I'M I'M

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:05.951
CONCERNED ON HELP.

00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:07.419
HELLO THIS IS IMPACTING THEM.

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:12.023
BUT THERE'S A QUOTE HERE THAT I

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.692
THOUGHT KIND OF SUMS UP -- THIS

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:15.460
FROM THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS.

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:17.829
SB SIXTY NINE MANDATES A GNETIC

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:19.598
TESTING PROTOCOL THAT USES

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:21.299
PERCENTAGE BASED TAGGING AND

00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:23.602
ASSIGNS THE COST OF THE PROTOCOL

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:25.403
TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.972
IDENTIFYING A PUBLIC FUNDING

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:28.607
SOURCE INCREDIBLE INSTITUTION

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:31.109
UNDERTAKE INAPPROPRIATE STUDY IS

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:32.511
A MORE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF

00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:33.512
ACTION AND HAVING THE

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:35.013
LEGISLATURE EMBARK.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.515
ON THE MICROMANAGEMENT OF

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.617
HATCHERIES AND TAGGING

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:39.918
TECHNOLOGIES.

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.820
I THINK THAT IN CAPSULE IT'S AT

00:23:41.887 --> 00:23:43.255
LEAST A BIT OF WHAT I'M.

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:45.390
TRYING TO APPRECIATE HERE IS

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:47.492
THAT MAYBE WE'RE JUST A LITTLE

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.194
BIT.

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:51.596
TO FAR AS THE HORSES TOO MUCH

00:23:51.663 --> 00:23:53.131
HEAD OF THE CART I'M WONDERING.

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:54.499
HOW DO WE BRING ALL THIS

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:56.234
INFORMATION TOGETHER BECAUSE IF

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:57.435
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS

00:23:57.502 --> 00:23:59.905
INTRODUCTION BILL -- THAT REALLY

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:01.139

WERE INCLUDING SO MANY DIFFERENT

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:05.143
THINGS -- IN THE MAYBE

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.912
MERITORIOUS ABSOLUTELY BUT HOW

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:08.980

00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:10.816
SAME APPROPRIATE TIME SO THEY'RE

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:12.651

YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS A A

00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:14.379
MASSIVE BILL.

VOTE FOR IT.

00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:20.919
I'M WONDERING WHAT IS THE ORIGIN

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:24.222
OF TIS BILL BECAUSE YOUR YOUR

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:26.291
SHIFT IN.

ONE DEPARTMENT TO ANOTHER YEAR

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:32.364
YOU'RE MOVING THINGS AROUND IN A

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:36.768
WAY THAT'S IF FROM FROM JUST.

00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:39.537
A CURSORY REVIEW IT SEEMS VERY

00:25:39.604 --> 00:25:41.172
AGGRESSIVE TO ME.

00:25:41.239 --> 00:25:42.741
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE LIST OF

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:43.975
SUPPORTERS.

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:46.711
AND OPPOSERS IT MAKES ME A

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:48.446
LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:49.648
THE INTENT.

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:52.150
OF THE BILL REALLY AS AND IN

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:54.619
SOME CASES WE ALWAYS WANT TO

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:56.087
STREAMLINE THE REGULATORY

00:25:56.154 --> 00:25:57.422
PROCESS WE WANT TO MAKE IT USER

00:25:57.489 --> 00:26:02.427
FRIENDLY -- BUT WE ALSO -- WE

00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:04.095
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

OBJECTIVES ARE ARE ACHIEVED IN

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:07.165
THAT WE'RE REALLY PROTECTING THE

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.199
ENVIRONMENT OUT THERE AND NOT

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:10.835
JUST.

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:13.038
CREATE INIT SO -- SOME

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:14.572
INDUSTRIES COULD NO LONGER

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:16.608
EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S JUST

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:20.712
MY CONCERN HERE IN LOOKING AT

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:22.948
SOME AREAS THAT MAKE ME WONDER

00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:24.349
WHY IT WHERE DD YOU GET RID --

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:27.552
IDEAS FOR SHIFTING -- REGULATORY

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:29.754
VIEW FROM ONE AGENCY TO ANOTHER

00:26:29.821 --> 00:26:31.056
I MEAN WE CAN WE CAN GET INTO

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:33.291
THE DETAILS AND MAYBE THAT'S

00:26:33.358 --> 00:26:36.027
THAT WOULD TAKE. TOO MUCH OF THE

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:37.395
DISCUSSION HERE BUT GENERALLY

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:38.830
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE IDEAS

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:40.165
FROM I MEAN AE THESE ARE.

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:41.800
ARE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:46.371
SOME -- INDEPENDENT STUDY OR

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:47.772
EVERYONE WHERE DISCOMFORT.

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:50.008
THIS WAS -- ACTUALLY REPRESENTS

00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:51.910
PROBABLY ABOUT A A YEAR AND A

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:55.146
HALF WORTH OF WORK THIS WASN'T

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:55.347
JUST.

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:56.481
YOU KNOW.

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:57.716
RIGHT A BILL IN A DAY AND

00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:59.150
ANOTHER THREE MINUS IS NOT A

00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:00.618
BILL THAT WAS WRITTEN A DAY I'LL

00:27:00.685 --> 00:27:04.322
I'LL GIVE MY MY MY OFFICE WORKS --

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:06.157
INTENSELY FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A

00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:08.560
HOUSE -- WITH -- IN AND IT

00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:11.730
STARTED WITH A FEW DIFFERENT

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:13.031
IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE.

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:13.932
OCEAN HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:16.101
YOUR ECOSYSTEMS AROUND HELPED

00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:17.102
AND OTHER.

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:18.370
YOU KNOW -- ECOSYSTEMS THAT ARE

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:22.107
DYING -- IN THE OCEAN -- AND IT

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:24.843
AND WORKING WITH AN EXTENSIVE --

00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:28.113
SO STAKEHOLDERS AND AND I THINK

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:30.181
I'M PRETTY PROUD OF THE OF THE

00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:31.616
SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE.

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:33.118
ARE FOR THE BILL I CAN ALWAYS

00:27:33.184 --> 00:27:34.452
IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE BUILD BUT

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.755
WERE -- FRANKLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:38.490
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE COLLAPSE

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:42.894
OF OUR OF SO MANY ECOSYSTEMS.

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:43.895
IT WOULD WE ARE WHO WERE IN AN

00:27:43.962 --> 00:27:46.698
EMERGENCY AND SO -- YOU KNOW AS

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:49.167
I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ARE --

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:50.301
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:51.636
COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:53.171
IMPACTED INDUSTRIES WERE NOT

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:55.473
TRYING TO DRIVE ANYONE OUT OF

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.042
BUSINESS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:27:57.108 --> 00:27:58.510
WE WANT TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:00.678
AND AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:02.680
CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK -- BUT

00:28:02.747 --> 00:28:05.683
YES WE DO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.786
WE'RE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:09.054
STUDY.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.189
A LOT OF ANALYSIS WE WE KNOW

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:13.158
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND IT AND

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:15.093
IT IS AN EMERGENCY AND WERE --

00:54:31.267 --> 00:54:33.003
SB ONE IS INCREDIBLY BROAD BUT

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:35.238
BECAUSE IT IS BROAD -- THERE ARE

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:37.240
A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ISSUES IN

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:39.442
THE BILL -- THAT WE FEEL MUST BE

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:44.047
ADDRESSED AND FOR THE INTEREST

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:44.648
OF TIME I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT A

00:54:44.714 --> 00:54:44.948
FEW.

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:50.420
FIRST SEIZURE ACT DUE PROCESS

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:52.522
THAT MEANS NO NOTICE -- NO

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:55.025
PUBLIC COMMENT THAT'S FOR NGOS

00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:56.860
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND

00:54:56.926 --> 00:54:59.129
OBVIOUSLY THE THE THE BUSINESS

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:01.798
COMMUNITY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:01.998
THESE.

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:03.199
NEW REGULATIONS.

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:04.634
THE THERE IS NO OFFICE OF

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:06.670
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OVERSIGHT AT

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:07.737
ALL IN THE BILL.

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:10.140
SO BASICALLY -- THE SIX A. P. A.

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:13.543
STANDARDS ARE NOT AT ALL ADDRESS.

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:14.678
FOR ANY PROFLIGATE RULE MAKING.

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:16.279
AND JUST TO ADDRESS THE THE IDEA

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:18.882
THAT SB ONE LITERALLY COPIES AND

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.350
PASTES FEDERAL LAW IN THE STATE

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:22.552
LAW IS -- OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.988
HOW ALL FEDERAL AND STATE LAW --

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:27.624
INTERACT I THINK THE PUBLICATION

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.092
OF RULE MAKING THE DEVIL IN THE

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:31.761
DETAILS AND PUBLIC NOTICE AND

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:34.297
COMMENT ARE ESSENTIAL. TO AVOID

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:35.598
THE ONLY OTHER REDRESS WOULD BE

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:37.934
LITIGATION AND SO FOR US.

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:40.170
THAT'S ONE MAJOR CONCERN AND

00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:44.607
ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE IS -- AROUND

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:47.077
THE BIOLOGICAL -- OPINIONS AND

00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:48.211
IT'S IT'LL TAKE PERMITS UNDER

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:50.547
HOW THE ESSAYS OPERATES UNDER SB

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:55.485
ONE WE DO NOT OPPOSE HOW SB --

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:57.520
ONE ADDRESSES -- THE LISTING OR

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:58.288
DOWN THE SCENE AT THE FEDERAL

00:55:58.354 --> 00:56:00.223
LEVEL BUT AGAIN HOW THEY GO

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.225
ABOUT THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS AND

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:03.426
AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:04.761
PROPONENTS WE ARE WORKING TO

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:06.496
ADDRESS THESE TECHNICAL CONCERNS

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:09.933
BUT OVERALL ARE NOT OPPOSE THE

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:10.166
INTENT.

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:12.268
THANK YOU.

00:56:12.335 --> 00:56:13.136
THE MORNING NO -- KRAMER'S THE

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:13.636
CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU

00:56:13.703 --> 00:56:13.937
FEDERATION.

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:14.504
I THINK WE WE SHARE THE THE

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:15.638
TECHNICAL CONCERNS THAT THE

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:17.574
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- OUTLINED

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.241
I WANT TO GET A LITTLE MORE

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:20.110
SPECIFIC IN THE ENDANGERED

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:20.710
SPECIES ACT PROVISIONS OF THE

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.846
BILL.

00:56:22.912 --> 00:56:25.048
SO THE BILL I'M PURPORTS TO JUST

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:26.583
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:27.951
ANY SPECIES ARE CHANGES THAT THE

00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:29.285
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE

00:56:29.352 --> 00:56:31.621
CHALLENGES IT ALSO GIVES THE

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:33.089
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE.

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:35.658
GREATER AUTHORITY TO STEP IN AND

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:38.862
STOP ACTIONS AND CONTROL ACTIONS --

00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:40.663
IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.599
AND IS INVOLVED.

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:44.801
THAT IS THE LARGEST CONCERN I AM

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:46.603
BUT ON THE THE DELISTING AND

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:48.071
DOWN LISTING PIECE IS IT DOESN'T

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:50.206
REALLY ALLOW FOR A RECOGNITION

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:51.674
THAT TIME SOMETIMES THE

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:52.675
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.410
SUCCESSFUL AND SPECIES ARE

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:55.245
RECOVERED.

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:57.380
AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE THE BILL

00:56:57.447 --> 00:56:59.282
RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T NEED TO

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:01.351
LIST SPECIES IF THEY'RE REMOVED

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:03.953
IT FROM THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.755
SPECIES ACT BECAUSE ACTIONS HAVE

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.290
BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THEY HAVE

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:07.791
RECOVERED.

00:57:07.857 --> 00:57:09.359
SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:12.562
TO DEAL WITH I'M THE OTHER ISSUE

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:13.897
WHICH IS IS MUCH LARGER.

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:16.299
IS HOW THIS WILL AFFECT THE

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:19.035
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:21.404
JUST BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE STATE

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:23.173
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD.

00:57:23.239 --> 00:57:27.177
IN THAT NOW SB ONE WOULD GIVE

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:28.278
THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

00:57:28.344 --> 00:57:30.713
WILDLIFE GREATER AUTHORITY TO

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.917
SAY NO TO ANY CHANGES THAT COULD

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:35.051
BE VIEWED.

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:38.488
AS BACKSLIDING SO IF WE ARE

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:40.757
FOLLOWING SCIENCE AND SCIENCE

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:45.161
DICTATES CHANGES YET BACK IN

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:45.829
TWENTY SIXTEEN OR TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:57:45.895 --> 00:57:50.133
OR TWO THOUSAND WE WEREN'T AS

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.568
UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCIENCE.

00:57:51.634 --> 00:57:53.870
AND SO THE FEDERAL STANDARDS AT

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:56.439
THAT DATE WERE DIFFERENT WE

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:59.509
WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED UNDER SB

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:00.977
ONE TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:02.412
AND SO UNDER THOSE SETTLEMENT

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:03.479
AGREEMENTS.

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:05.715
THEY MAY BE THROWN OUT OR MAY

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:07.383
NOT BE ALLOWED TO PROCEED

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:08.818
BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT COULD GET

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:11.321
SUED IF THEY ALLOW AN ACTION

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:12.589
THAT COULD BE VIEWED AS

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.057
BACKSLIDING.

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:17.961
THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN.

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:19.128
I'M IS THAT.

00:58:19.195 --> 00:58:21.598
IT'S GOING TO STOP ACTIONS AND

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:23.867
STOP CALIFORNIA FROM MOVING

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:24.734
FORWARD WITH THE SCIENCE.

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:27.770
AND THE OTHER PIECE THE BILL

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:29.138
ALSO HAS A PROVISION THAT

00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:30.607
ATTEMPTS TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT

00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:33.309
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AUTHORITY --

00:58:33.376 --> 00:58:34.377
OVER CONTROL OF THE CENTRAL

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.446
VALLEY PROJECT OBVIOUSLY THEY

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:38.848
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH -- SEASON

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:41.284
NOW BUT THE BILL IS DOING IS

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:42.518
TRYING TO EQUATE ENDANGERED

00:58:42.585 --> 00:58:43.987
SPECIES ACT PROTECTIONS WITH

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:46.723
WATER RATES -- AND FINALLY ON

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:49.125
THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED IN THE

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:50.927
ANALYSIS I THINK THERE DOES NEED

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:52.328
TO BE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:53.963
DISTINCT POPULATION SEGMENT WE

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.965
DO NOT LIST -- DISTINCT

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:57.033

CALIFORNIA LAW SB ONE ACTUALLY

00:59:01.771 --> 00:59:03.373
UNLIKE IN SB FORTY NINE THAT

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:04.407
CALIFORNIA SHOULD ONLY BE

CALIFORNIA LAW.

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:10.380
I'M SO THERE DOES NEED TO BE

00:59:10.446 --> 00:59:12.248

WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT'S TRYING

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:11.254
LOT OF THREATEN WATER BODIES I

REPRESENT.

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.490

I REPRESENT A SEE THAT IS

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:19.228
ENDANGERED AND SHRINKING IN AND

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:20.763

RIVER VALLEY ON THE NEW RIVER ON

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:32.542
THE SALTON SEA.

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.777
WE HAVE MORE THREATENED SPECIES

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.546
NOW THAN EVER AND THEIR SILENT

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:37.680
ON THAT.

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.715
ON ON ON GLOW THEIR SILENT ON

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:44.754
GLOBAL CHANGE ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.988
EVERYTHING THAT IS.

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:47.423
LEE THE BIGGEST THREAT ON OUR

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.592
HEALTH.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.761
I IN OUR EXISTENCE.

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.329
THERE ARE SILENT ON THE QUOTE

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:54.130
QUITE THE CONTRARY THEY'RE

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:56.866
TAKING THEIR GOING BACK DECADES

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:58.568
AND DECADES.

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.903
IN HISTORY. TO REPEAT POLICIES

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:03.472
THAT GOT US EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:05.141
WHEN WE NEED TO DO THE OPPOSITE.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.742
SO.

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:08.544
I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.112
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:12.381
NECESSARY AT THIS TIME OF WAR

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:14.984
WHERE WE WHERE WHEN.

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:16.719
WE ARE DEALING WITH SOMEBODY

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:19.522
THAT -- LEADING THIS COUNTRY

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:22.858
BACK -- TO A PAST.

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.594
THAT HAS CREATED ENORMOUS

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.796
PROBLEMS.

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:27.296
YES.

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:29.432
THAT WE NEED TO BE SOLVING NOW

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:31.667
WHEN AND I I THINK.

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.069
I'D LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE ASKING

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.904
THE ADMINISTRATION WHERE'S THE

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.472
SCIENCE WARS ASSIGNMENTS IN YOUR

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:37.640
ACTIONS.

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:40.643
SO WE CAN SO WE CAN SUPPORT THE

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:41.177
SUN.

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:44.046
IF THERE'S NONE.

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:45.214
AND IF THERE'S NO SCIENCE THEY

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:46.549
SHOULD DO SOME ABOUT IT BECAUSE

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:48.784
THIS IS AND THIS IS NOT GOOD

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:49.952
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EVERY.

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:52.755
ASPECT OF OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:54.657
OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.459
I MEAN THERE THE LIST IS SO

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:57.560
LARGE THAT.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:01.063
MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.932
TO SPEND TO JUST GO THROUGH.

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:03.866
ALL THE HORRIBLETHINGS THAT ARE

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.201
HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY AND I

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:07.036
THINK WE NEED TO FIGHT BACK AND

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.104
THIS IS A BILL AT LEAST.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.972
IT THIS SEEMS LIKE.

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.307
A REASONABLE BILL TO ME BECAUSE

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:13.309
I THINK THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:14.610
PROBLEM WE SHOULD BE DOING BUT

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:15.711
BUT AT LEAST.

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:17.280
THIS IS A STATUS QUO BILL AND I

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.815
THINK FURTHER OUR STAFF LOCALLY --

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:22.084
AS THEY TRY TO ENFORCE THIS.

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:23.586
YOU KNOW THIS THIS WILL BE MUCH

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:24.920
EASIER TO DO THAN IF WE CREATED

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:28.991
ENORMOUS CHANGES SAY NOW WE HAVE.

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:30.059
TO CREATE NEW REGULATIONS RIGHT

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.527
NOW I THINK.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.129
IN DEALING WITH ANY CHANGES IF

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:34.764
THEY'RE NOT BASED ON SOLID

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.365
SCIENCE IT GIVES US.

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:39.702
A PLATFORM TO ROUTE TO TO

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.003
CHALLENGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:43.072
AND WE HAVE TO PREPARE OURSELVES

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:46.542
FOR THAT AND WHATEVER.

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:47.943
WHATEVER THE REACTION IS ON OUR

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.213
BEHALF IT'S GOING TO BE BASED ON

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.182
OF FEDERAL ACTION THAT'S NOT

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:54.317
BASED ON SCIENCE AND I THINK

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:56.252
WILL WIN THAT DEBATE IN COURT.

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.253
AND IF IT AND IF FOR CHOIRS THIS

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.588
TO DO THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO WE

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:02.124
HAVE -- TO WE HAVE TO MARK MARK

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:03.592
OUR POSITION AND HOLD IT.

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.394
AND NOT LET UP.

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.096
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:09.799

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:17.940
BARGES.

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:20.109
I I COME AT THIS FROM A

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:21.677
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE --

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:24.180
REPRESENTING -- THE CENTRAL

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:26.248
VALLEY -- I FIRST CAME TO THE

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:28.951
CENTRAL VALLEY AFTER LAW SCHOOL

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:31.120
TO CLERK FOR A FEDERAL JUDGE --

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:33.155
NATIONALLY REGARDED BY WATER

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:34.023
JUDGE.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:35.391
AND DURING THE YEAR OF THAT

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:40.162
CLERKSHIP -- I WAS INUNDATED --

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:43.265
INTO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT.

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.601
AND WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANT FOR

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:48.771
AGRICULTURE FOR FISHING --

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.873
ANYTHING THAT -- IN ITS

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.508
TENTACLES WOULD REACH INTO.

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:55.177
WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT?

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:56.479
THE INTERPRETATION OF THE

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.681
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THE

01:06:58.748 --> 01:06:59.815
POLITICAL.

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:02.785
INFLUENCE AGENTS THAT WERE AT

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.253
PLAY IN THIS.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.155
IT'S EASY FOR US TO TAKE A STEP

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:08.057
BACK OR TOO EASY FOR US TO TO

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:09.291
COMMENT THAT.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:11.026
THIS IS A WASHINGTON VERSUS

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:13.529
SACRAMENTO ISSUE IF WASHINGTON

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:14.964
WON'T STEP IN AND SACRAMENTO

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.499
MUST.

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:17.566
I THINK THAT IS A GROSS

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:19.502
OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF A VERY

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:21.137
SOPHISTICATED PROBLEM.

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:22.738
THAT IS DEALING WITH THE

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:25.107
LIFESTYLE -- THAT EXIST IN THE

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.143
CENTRAL VALLEY AND ELSEWHERE IN

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:28.377
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:31.480
BUT IF WE IF WE GIVE UNFETTERED

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:34.750
POWERS THE STATE AGENTS.

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.852
GIVEN THE THE INFLUENCE OF

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:39.088
CERTAIN -- LAYERS HAVE IN THE

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:40.356
CAPITAL HERE.

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:42.024
I'M AFRAID THAT THE HUMAN

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:44.660
ELEMENT THAT HAS BEEN LITIGATE --

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.296
FOR YEARS IN PARTICULAR WE GO

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:49.131
BACK TO THE DELTA SMELT ISSUE.

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:51.300
HOW EXACTLY DOES THE PROTECTION

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:52.635
OF?

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:55.171
THE SPECIES WHERE THERE IS

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:57.640
DIVERGENT BIOLOGICAL

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.408
INTERPRETATIONS.

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.710
BUT ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN THE

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:03.846
FOLLOWING OF GROUND BECAUSE

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.215
FARMERS IN AGRICULTURALIST

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:07.783
CANNOT SURVIVE.

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:09.752
WE CALL OURSELVES THE BREAD

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:11.086
BASKET OF OF THE WORLD.

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:12.655
WELL THAT'S NOT GOING TO

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:14.223
CONTINUE FOLKS.

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.558
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT GOAL WAY.

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:16.992
SO WE MAY BE LOOKING AT

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:20.162
ENVIRONMENTAL A PRISTINE VISION

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.865
FOR TOMORROW AND TAKING UP THE

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.433
MANTLE AGAINST WASHINGTON.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.036
BUT WE ARE ERODING WAY HOW WE

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:29.839
PRODUCE FOOD IN IN THE VALLEY

01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:31.173
AND ELSEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.075
SO ELL I APPRECIATE THE STATED

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.176
GOALS OF THIS PROPOSED

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.545
LEGISLATION.

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:40.850
I THINK IT IS. TO DRIVING AWAY

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.518
AGRICULTURE FOR ALL OF

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:43.953
CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT JUST.

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.688
UP FROM THE VALLEY BUT WINE

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:48.858
COUNTRY AND IN FISHING I THINK

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:51.527
WE ARE OPENING UP A PANDORA'S

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:56.198
BOX -- WE HEARD FROM ONE OF THE

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.933
FOLKS WHO TESTIFIED EARLIER.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.468
THAT IF WE BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:00.803
IS PROGRESSIVE AND I DO BELIEVE

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.171
IN SCIENCE.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.739
IN ANY OF THOSE THAT -- THAT

01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:05.374
THINK OTHERWISE I THINK NEED TO

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:07.343
OPEN UP THEIR TEXTBOOKS I

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:10.346
BELIEVE IN -- SCALI MET THAT I

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:11.881
BELIEVE IN PEER REVIEW.

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:14.283
IT HAS ABSOLUTE MERIT.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.118
AND FOR THOSE THAT THINK THAT

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.553
SCIENCE SHOULD BE TOSSED OUT

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.088
WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.122
BUT WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.825
WE BALANCE SCIENCE WITH OUR WAY

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:24.093
OF LIFE.

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:26.595
HE CANNOT BE ONE OR THE OTHER IT

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.330
HAS TO BE BOTH IN THEY HAVE TO

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:29.965
BE SYNERGISTC AN APPRECIATIVE

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.267
OF THE OTHER SURVIVAL.

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.736
AND MY MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS

01:09:33.802 --> 01:09:35.137
DOES NOT DO THAT.

01:09:35.204 --> 01:09:37.540
THIS IS TAKING A WASHINGTON

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:40.376
FIGHT BUT KILLING.

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:43.746
OUR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:46.615
THAT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION.

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:47.917
THE OTHER SENATORS COMMENTS

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:50.719

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:53.455

I WANT TO ADDRESS IN THE CLOSE

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:14.810

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:17.713

NOW WITH WASHINGTON.

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:25.588
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S DRIVING

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:27.323
THIS.

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:28.857
GIVEN OIL LOBBYIST.

TOWARDS THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY.

I RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:43.739
CHALLENGES THAT FOLKS HAVE FACED

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:44.673
OVER THE YEARS WITH THE

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:45.507
ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:46.809

TODAY IS NOT SO MUCH WITH THE

01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:52.181
STATE'S ROLE BUT WITH THE

01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:53.349
MECHANICS OF THE LAW.

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:56.585
THE ADMINISTRATION HOWEVER OF

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:57.286

WE DO NOT -- PROPOSE HERE SOME

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.457
RADICAL OVERHAUL OF HOW IT'S

CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED AND

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:05.260
ENFORCED -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:07.029
THE OPPOSITE OF UNFETTERED IS

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.897
BUT I THINK THERE'S THERE'S

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:10.766
THERE'S PLENTY OF FEDERATION --

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:13.202
I GUESS IN THIS LEGISLATION OR

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.337
AT LEAST THAT'S THE INTENT --

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:16.872
THAT THIS IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.774
A SORT OF WIDE OPEN DOOR -- TO

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:21.010
PASS A WHOLE SERIES OF NEW

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.545
UNANTICIPATED REGULATIONS THIS

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:25.047

BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAVE SOME

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:28.751
CERTAINTY THAT AT LEAST THINGS

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.452
ARE GOING TO STAY THE WAY THEY

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:31.120
WERE.

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.188
BACK BEFORE WE FORGOT ABOUT

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:35.958
SCIENCE AND WE'RE HOPING THAT

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:37.693
WITH THAT SORT OF BRIEF PERIOD

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.461
OF CALM WE CAN GET THROUGH THE

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:41.797
NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND GET BACK

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.732
TO NORMAL -- THEN WE CAN

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:46.135
ACTUALLY START TO MOVE FOR TO

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:46.702
WRESTLE WITH SOME OF THESE

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:47.870
LARGER ISSUE SO.

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:48.871
LOOK I RECOGNIZE THIS THIS

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.306
CREATES AN UNCOMFORTABLE TENSION

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:52.708
AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS GONNA

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.510
NECESSITATES A MAD BECAUSE HE

SOMEONE WANTS TO HOLD THE TAIL

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.963
AND LOOK LIKE A TOUGH GUY --

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.031
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE IN THE STATE

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:18.233

BILL -- THREE OH SEVEN AS MANY

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:08.243
OF YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST --

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.244
TWENTY YEARS COULD TEASE A

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:10.946
CORPORATE LANDAU AROUND IN THE

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.047
MOJAVE DESERT.

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:13.615
HAS PROPOSED TO PUMP AN AVERAGE

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.884
OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.853
WATER PER YEAR THAT'S OVER

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.088
SIXTEEN BILLION GALLONS. FOR

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:22.291
FIFTY YEARS FROM THE AQUIFER

01:14:22.357 --> 01:14:23.592
UNDERNEATH THE MOJAVE.

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:24.760
AND SELL IT TO VARIOUS WATER

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.228
DISTRICTS IN ORANGE AND LOS

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:26.962
ANGELES COUNTIES IN OTHER

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:28.230
COUNTIES AT A PROFIT FOR

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.400
PURPOSES OF GUARANTEEING WATER.

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:33.335
TO ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:34.369
HOMES.

01:14:34.436 --> 01:14:36.071
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.073
SCIENCE IS IN CONFLICT AS TO

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.474
WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:42.177
SUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF PUMPING IS.

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:43.946
AND IF FRANKLY COULD THESE IS

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.514
WRONG ON THE SUBJECT A LEVEL OF

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.149
PUMPING COULD POTENTIALLY

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:48.917
DESTROY THE MOJAVE DESERT.

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:51.119
IN THE PROCESS THAT'S THE

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:52.421
PURPOSE OF THE BILL.

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.556
THIS BILL SEEKS TO HIT THE PAUSE

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:56.525
BUTTON ON THIS MASSIVE WATER

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:57.860
EXTRACTION PROJECT.

01:14:57.926 --> 01:15:00.095
IN THIS VERY FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.830
THAT HAS EXISTED IN BALANCE FOR

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:02.931
CENTURIES.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.800
HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON SO WE

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:07.903
REVIEW ANALYZE AND GET THE

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:08.937
SCIENCE RIGHT.

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:10.839
NOW THE PROJECT HAS BEEN STALLED

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:13.008
FOR YEARS BECAUSE IN THE MINDS

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:14.343
OF MANY THE MATH JUST DOESN'T

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.278
ADD UP.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.480
KITTY IS AS I SAID WANTS TO PULL

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:19.715
FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:23.185
YEAR OUT BUT I CAN'T EVEN HEAR

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.319
MYSELF.

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:26.221
BUT ADMITS THAT THE AQUIFER ONLY

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:29.424
REFILLS AT A RATE OF THIRTY TWO

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:30.425
THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR.

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:32.461
RENOWNED SCIENTISTS WORKING WITH

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:34.696
THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:36.131
THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:39.768
SAY THE REFILL RATE IS MORE LIKE

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:41.470
200-021-0000 ACRE FEET PER YEAR

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:43.438
NOW KIDDIES HASN'T EVAPORATION

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:46.174
THEORY TO ATTACH TO THE PROJECT.

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.609
ON WHICH IT'S PUMPING PLAN IS

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:48.911
BASED.

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:50.345
BUT THE SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ARE

01:15:50.412 --> 01:15:53.048
IN CONFLICT AS TO THE EFFICACY

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:54.650
INVALIDITY OF THAT EVAPORATION

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:55.384
PLAN.

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.719
SO IF THE U. S. G. S. AND THE

01:15:57.786 --> 01:16:00.555
PARK SERVICE SCIENCE IS CORRECT.

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.291
THAT'S AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:03.759
ACRE FEET PER YEAR FOURTEEN

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.894
BILLION GALLONS LESS THAN THE

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:07.429
COULD THESE PLAN.

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:08.664
CLEARLY.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.300
THERE IS A SERIOUS CONFLICT IN

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:12.434
THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT'S

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:13.835
THAT'S BEING PRESENTED IN THIS

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.270
CASE AND THAT SURROUNDING THIS

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:16.405
PROJECT.

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.340
AND IF COULD DISS MISCALCULATED

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.275
THE SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE NOT

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:21.877
ONLY WILL THE ECO SYSTEM IN THE

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:23.211
HOBBY FACE DESTRUCTION.

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.147
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ONE HUNDRED

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:26.048
THOUSAND NEW HOUSEHOLDS THAT

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:27.783
COME TO DEPEND ON THE WATER

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:28.517
SUPPLY.

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:29.952
THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WILL HAVE A

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:32.120
VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AS WELL IF

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:34.656
AND WHEN COULD DISS FORCED TO

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:35.390
STOP PUMPING.

01:16:35.457 --> 01:16:37.492
SO WE THINK THAT CONFLICT SHOULD

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:39.161
BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE PUMPING

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.796
STARTS AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:42.764
WHAT THIS BILL DOES NO MORE NO

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:43.932
LESS.

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:46.168
NOW YOU HAVE HEARD OR WILL HEAR

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:47.402
A LOT ABOUT KIDDIES IN THE CUT A

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:49.771
SEQUEL RATHER IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:51.006
THIS BILL SEQUEL.

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:52.407
AND HOW COULD THESE IN ITS

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:54.309
PROJECTS OF ONE FIVE OR SIX

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:55.344
SEQUEL LAWSUITS.

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.979
AND THAT THE COURTS HAVE CLEARLY

01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:58.814
RESOLVE THE SCIENCE IN FAVOR OF

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.916
CANDIES AND HAVE VALIDATED.

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:02.150
IT'S PUMPING PROPOSAL

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:03.518
UNFORTUNATELY THOSE OF YOU WHO

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:04.753
ARE FAMILIAR WITH SEEK WINDOW

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.189
THAT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE.

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:09.591
SEEK WHAT IS A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:10.993
STATUTE THAT REQUIRES PROJECT

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:12.728
PROPONENTS AND THE COURTS TO

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:13.996
IDENTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:18.834
IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.369
THOSE IMPACTS IN FACT IN

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:21.670
REVIEWING THE SCIENTIFIC

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:23.105
EVIDENCE FOR AND AGAINST THE

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:24.940
PROJECTS SUCH AS THE PUMPING

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:26.375
RATES HERE.

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:28.276
AS THE COURT IN COULD DISS OWN

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:29.945
APPELLATE CASE NOTED COURTS ARE

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:32.214
NOT PERMITTED TO WEIGH AND

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.582
RESOLVE CONFLICTS.

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:34.916
IN THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:36.385
PRESENTED AND THIS IS WHAT THE

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:37.986
COURT SAID IN THAT APPELLATE

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:39.621
DECISION IN REVIEWING THE LEAD

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:41.823
AGENCIES ACTIONS UNDER SEQUEL WE

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:42.958
MAY NOT.

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:44.693
SET ASIDE AN AGENCIES APPROVAL

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.328
OF ANY I ARE ON THE GROUND AT

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:47.896
THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION WOULD

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.998
HAVE BEEN EQUALLY OR MORE

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:52.934
REASONABLE IN OTHER WORDS.

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.302
NO WEIGHING OF SCIENCE.

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:55.604
NOW IN CASE THERE'S ANY DOUBT

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.838
AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE SINCE I'VE

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:58.240
BEEN SAYING THE SAME THING FROM

01:17:58.306 --> 01:18:00.175
THE OUTSET OF MY PARTICIPATION

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:01.777
IN THIS BILL I AM NOT -- WILL

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.745
REPEAT NOT TRYING TO PREVENT THE

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:05.647
PUMPING OF WATER FROM THIS

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:07.282
AQUIFER BYE KIDDIES. FOR ANY

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.151
FUTURE LANDOWNER IN THE MOJAVE

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:10.485
BECAUSE THIS BILL IS NOT

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:12.287
STRICTLY TARGETING TO DETECT

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:13.155
GOODIES.

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:14.656
IT IS A BILL PROTECTING THE

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:16.291
MOJAVE DESERT FROM LANDOWNERS

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.126
WHO PROPOSED TO PUMP WATER FROM

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:19.327
THE AQUIFER.

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:20.729
I'M SIMPLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:23.331
ANY PUMPING NEW OR IN THE FUTURE

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:26.101
IS DONE AT AN ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:27.135
SUSTAINABLE RATE [inaudible]

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:30.405
SO. TO BRING THIS TO A CLOSE I

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:31.773
THINK WE SHOULD HIT THE PAUSE

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.541
BUTTON AND HEAD OF AN

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:35.010
INDEPENDENT TEAM OF SCIENTISTS

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:36.978
REVIEWED THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.080
FOR AND AGAINST THE KIDDIES

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:39.347
PROJECT.

01:18:39.414 --> 01:18:41.116
AND RESOLVE THE CONFLICT AND

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:43.018
THEN BASED ON THAT REVIEW SAID

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:44.719
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:46.721
PUMPING RATE ONE THAT ENSURES AN

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:48.523
UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLY OF WATER TO

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:49.758
ALL RESIDENTS.

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.760
WHILE PRESERVING AND PROTECTING

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:53.495
THIS NATIONAL TREASURE WE CALL

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.797
THE MOJAVE FROM ANY POTENTIAL

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:57.065
MANMADE DESTRUCTION.

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.533
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SENATE BILL

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.435
THREE OF SEVEN DOES NO MORE OR

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.137
NO LESS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK

CALIFORNIA DESERT.

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:33.301
WE SEE THE CALIFORNIA DESERT AS

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:34.803
A AS AN ASSET WORTHY OF

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:37.506
CONTINUED INVESTMENT WE TOGETHER

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:38.773
HAVE PROTECTED LANDSCAPES

PROTECTED ICONIC PLACES LIKE

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:48.850
JOSHUA TREE IN THE MOJAVE FOR

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:51.620
GENERATIONS TO COME -- KIDDIES

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:54.156
IS EXHIBIT A OF FEDERAL

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:56.658
ADMINISTRATION BACKSLIDING THAT

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:57.926
HARMS OUR NATIONAL PARKS.

01:19:57.993 --> 01:19:59.161
BOB THE CONCERNS OF

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.795
ENVIRONMENTAL ROLLBACKS THAT

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:02.597
WE'RE WE'RE JUST DISCUSS DIED

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:04.132
DURING SB ONE ON WHAT THEY'RE

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:05.433
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN OUR

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.170
CALIFORNIA DESERT THIS IS REAL --

01:20:08.236 --> 01:20:09.704
SO PRIOR TO THE FEDERAL THIS

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:11.573
FEDERAL MINISTRATION COULD THESE

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.241
WERE WAS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:14.342
FEDERAL NEED TO REVIEW IN

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:16.044
ADDITION TO SEE WHAT BECAUSE THE

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:17.679
PROJECT PIPELINE WOULD RUN

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:18.780
THROUGH THE MOJAVE TRAILS

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:20.615
NATIONAL MONUMENTS.

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.984
AND WOOD OVER DRAFTING AQUIFER

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:24.452
THAT IMPACTS UP TO A LOT MORE

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:25.253
THAN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.621
ACRES OF FEDERALLY PROTECTED

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:27.522
LANDS.

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:29.291
THESE WERE THE RULES AND THEY

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:31.026
PROVIDE A CERTAINTY TO ALL

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:32.661
STAKEHOLDERS PROJECT YOU KNOW

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:33.862
FOR DECADES PRIOR.

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:35.497
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:36.264
HISTORY NGUYEN KIDDIES AS

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:37.632
PROPOSED TWENTY YEARS AGO IT

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:44.272
UNDERWENT BOTH FEDERAL AND

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:45.407
SEQUEL REVIEW.

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:46.208
ODJICK WAS REVIEWED BY THE

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:46.841
METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT AND

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:48.009
THAT DISTRICT REJECTED THE

01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:50.045
PROJECT -- BECAUSE IT THE

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:50.779
FEDERAL REVIEW SAD KIDDIES YOU

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:53.114
CAN'T PUMP AS MUCH WATER AS YOU

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:53.782
WANT TO WE CAN LIKE ALLOW YOU TO

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:54.449
PUMP IS STABLE RATE BUT NOT THE

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:55.083
AMOUNT THAT YOU WANT TO BECAUSE

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:56.284
IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE IT'S GROUND

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.686
WATER MINING.

01:20:57.752 --> 01:20:58.520
AND THE DIFFERENCE AS CENTER

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:01.489
ROSS EXPLAINED WAS STAGGERING --

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:03.391
AND SO FAST FOR TO OUR CURRENT

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:06.294
PROPOSAL -- THE KIDDIES COMPANY

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.129
STILL HAD A MAJOR ROADBLOCK WITH

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:10.498
OUR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION --

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:11.566
THEY SOUGHT AN EXEMPTION THE

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:13.902
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAID NOW.

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:15.604
DO THESE NEVER INITIATED THE

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:16.905
FEDERAL REVIEW THAT WAS REQUIRED

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:18.940
THE INSTEAD WAITED FOR THE

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:20.041
TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION.

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:22.277
AND THEY GOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.412
NEEDED -- KIDDIES IS FORMER --

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:25.747
LOBBYIST AND REPRESENTATIVE JOIN

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.415
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRANSITION

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:29.351
TEAM -- AND THAT TEAM

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:30.552
MIRACULOUSLY CALLED THE KIDDIES

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.188
PROJECT OUR NATION'S NUMBER

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:34.623
FIFTEEN NATIONAL.

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:37.726
EMERGENCY AND SECURITY PROJECT --

01:21:37.792 --> 01:21:39.861
IN THE IN THE COUNTRY AND THE IN

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:41.830
THE IN NEED A FAST TRACKING --

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:43.298
WITHIN MONTHS THAT -- IN

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:45.066
MINISTRATION REMOVED THE

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:47.135
SAFEGUARDS SB THREE OH SEVEN

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:48.903
SIMPLY PUT SINCE OUR REVIEW BACK

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:49.971
INTO PLACE.

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:51.706
THAT SAID NOTHING MORE WE NEED

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:54.109
THIS BECAUSE THE RULES AND THE

01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:55.377
PROCESS FEES ARE IMPORTANT THEY

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:55.530
SEAT WERE.

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:59.967
PROCESS AS THE GOLD STANDARD.

01:29:00.034 --> 01:29:01.602
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.137
ARE THE SAME SUPPORTERS BEFORE

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:04.672
YOU TODAY EVEN THOUGH THIS

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:06.908
PROJECT HAS GONE THROUGH THE

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:08.209
SEQUEL PROCESS.

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:09.377
A SEQUEL PROCESSES THAT INVOLVED

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:11.479
OVER TWENTY STATE AND LOCAL

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:13.247
AGENCIES.

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:14.515
THEY'RE HERE TODAY SUPPORTING

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:15.383
THE BILL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.652
LIKE THE OUTCOME OF THAT PROCESS

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:19.020
THEY WANT TO RAISE THE BAR

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.722
HIGHER BECAUSE THAT GOLD

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:22.323
STANDARD THAT THEY HOLD DIDN'T

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.358
RESULT IN THE OUTCOME THAT THEY

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:29.363
WANTED TO ACHIEVE.

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:31.199
IN ADDITION TO THOSE STATE AND

01:29:31.265 --> 01:29:32.600
LOCAL AGENCIES THAT WERE

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:34.235
INVOLVED THE COUNTY SAMBAR DINO

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:35.670
WAS NOT.

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:37.171
THE LEAD AGENCY IN THE SEQUEL

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:39.373
PROCESS SO THEY ACTUALLY LAYERED

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.975
ON TOP OF THAT REVIEW.

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:42.844
THEIR OWN SPECIFIC INDEPENDENT

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.512
REVIEW OF BOTH THE SCIENCE IN

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:45.747
THE OPERATION.

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:48.449
A VERY THOROUGH VETTING A VERY

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:49.917
EXHAUSTIVE VETTING.

01:29:49.984 --> 01:29:50.885
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT THAT

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.253
OUT BECAUSE THE COUNTY WAS

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.788
REALLY INDEPENDENT FROM THE

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:56.424
SEQUEL PROCESS.

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:58.092
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SCOPE

01:29:58.159 --> 01:29:59.494
FOR JUST A MINUTE WHAT'S THE

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.762
SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT.

01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:03.397
IT'S POTENTIALLY FIFTY THOUSAND

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:05.366
ACRE FEET A YEAR.

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:06.701
THAT'S FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:08.669
COMPARED TO THE VOLUME OF AT

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:11.506
LEAST TWENTY MILLION ACRE FEET

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:14.442
THAT IS ESTIMATED TO BE IN THIS

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:15.476
AQUIFER.

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:18.179
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LESS THAN 1%

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.214
A YEAR BACK LESS THAN ONE HALF

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.215
PERCENT A YEAR.

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:22.383
COMPARE THAT TO SOME OF THE

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:23.785
OTHER GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:25.319
BASINS THAT HAVE OVER DRAFTED

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:26.721
VERY SIX SIGNIFICANTLY AND YOU

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.122
BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND.

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.590
THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT IS

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:31.125
QUITE SMALL.

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:32.827
I'D ALSO LIKE TO CORRECT ONE

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.395
THING THAT WAS THAT WAS TALKED

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:35.763
ABOUT IN THE SUPPORTERS OF THE

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:36.564
BILL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:37.765
ACTUALLY DID APPROVE THIS

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:40.234
PROJECT IT WAS REVIEWED IN TWO

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:43.104
THOUSAND AND TEN WAS APPROVED.

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:44.472
HAVING SAID THAT AND

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:45.907
UNDERSTANDING THE AUTHOR'S

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:48.543
DESIRE TO HAVE A REVIEW OR

01:30:48.609 --> 01:30:51.379
RECONCILIATION OF OF THE SCIENCE

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.314
BEHIND THIS PROJECT.

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:56.851
WE DID SERIOUSLY PROVIDE OF AN

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:58.419
OFFER OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.321
AUTHOR.

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.190
THAT WOULD DO TWO THINGS. ONE IT

01:31:02.256 --> 01:31:05.026
WOULD ALLOW AND BRING INTO THE

01:31:05.092 --> 01:31:08.062
MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE PROJECT.

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:08.896
THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:12.300
RESOURCES AS A PARTNER IN THAT.

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:13.534
PLAN.

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:16.204
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE W. R. TO

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:17.538
BOTH REVIEW.

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:20.608
THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. FOR

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:23.144
THE PROJECT PRIOR TO ANY WATER

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:24.512
TRANSFERS.

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:26.047
BUT EVEN IN ADDITION AND GOING

01:31:26.113 --> 01:31:27.281
WAY BEYOND THAT GIVING THEM AN

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:29.684
ONGOING ROLE FOR THE FIFTY YEARS

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.419
OF THE PROJECT IN BOTH REVIEWING

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:34.222
ALL OF THE MONITORING RESULTS

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.456
THAT OCCUR.

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:38.359
AND GIVING THEM THE ABILITY. TOO

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:40.661
TO WEIGH IN AS AN EQUAL PARTNER

01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:41.429
ABOUT THE SCIENCE.

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:43.698
OF WE THINK THAT THAT WAS A

01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:45.967
REALLY BEYOND JUST RECONCILING

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.335
THE SCIENCE OF MAKING SURE THE

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:50.071
PROJECT OPERATED PROPERLY.

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:51.672
BUT HAVING THE DEPARTMENT IN

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:53.541
THAT PROCESS ALL ALONG THE WAY

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:55.109
IT'S AN EQUAL PARTNER WE THINK

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.310
THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN A

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:59.447
PROJECT LIKE THIS.

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:00.915
SO WHY ARE WE OPPOSE THE BILL A

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:02.717
COUPLE OF REASONS ONE THE STATE

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:03.951
LANDS COMMISSION HAD AN

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.953
OPPORTUNITY IN FACT WAS INVITED

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.054
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SEQUEL

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:09.190
PROCESS TO PROVIDE COMMENTS ON

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:11.359
THE PROJECT. TO EXPRESS ANY

01:32:11.425 --> 01:32:13.895
CONCERNS THAT THEY HAD.

01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:15.363
THE REALITY IS THEY CHOSE NOT.

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:17.398
TO NOW THIS BILL WANTS TO GIVE

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:19.433
THEM THE PRIMARY ROLE IN

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.135
REVIEWING THE PROJECT ONE MORE

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:23.070
TIME WHEN THEY HAD THAT

01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:25.239
OPPORTUNITY AND DIDN'T TAKE THAT

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:26.707
OPPORTUNITY IN THE SEQUEL

01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:28.175
PROCESS.

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:30.244
SECONDLY THERE'S NO SPECIFIC

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.879
PROCESS IN THIS BILL.

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:33.114
BILL LANGUAGE ASKED THE

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:36.050
DEPARTMENT TO PROVE A NEGATIVE.

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.551
TO PROVE THAT IN FACT THERE

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:40.755
WOULD BE NO ADVERSE IMPACT.

01:32:40.821 --> 01:32:42.323
NOT ONLY IS THAT DIFFICULT TO DO

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:43.791
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:44.392
BECAUSE THERE'S NO

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:45.993
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS SPELLED

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.194
OUT IN THE BILL.

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:48.996
IT ACTUALLY WOULD ALLOW THE

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:51.966
STATE LANDS COMMISSION EVEN IF

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:53.367
THE SCIENCE WERE BORN OUT TO BE.

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:56.771
SAFE AND NOT PROVIDE ANY.

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.239
UNDESIRABLE RESULTS THE

01:32:58.306 --> 01:32:59.607
COMMISSION MEMBERS THEMSELVES

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.175
COULD SIMPLY VOTE TO REJECT THE

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:02.610
PROJECT EVEN IF THE SCIENCE IS

01:33:02.677 --> 01:33:04.111
BORN OUT.

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:05.579
BECAUSE OF THAT DISCRETION

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:07.181
BECAUSE THERE'S NO PROCESS.

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:09.150
WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL NOW

01:33:09.216 --> 01:33:10.952
WE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT

01:33:11.018 --> 01:33:12.853
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR WE

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.021
RECOGNIZE.

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:15.890
HIS WELL INTENTIONED APPROACH

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:17.925
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO TO TRYING

01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:19.193
TO FIND A WAY TO GET TO THAT

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.796
PLACE WHERE THE SCIENCE ANSWERS

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:23.531
CAN BE.

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:25.232
PROVIDED TO THE AUTHOR IT AT THE

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:27.902
SAME TIME NOT RECREATE THE WILL

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:29.503
FOR THE PROJECT A GOOD THANK YOU

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:30.938
I'M GONNA TREAT THAT AS A TWO

01:33:31.005 --> 01:33:32.940
AND A HALF MINUTES TIMES TO

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:34.475
WHICH WAS FIVE MINUTES.

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:36.377
I WOULD ASSUME YOU OPPOSE THE

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:39.180
BILL MR SLATER.

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:39.914
YES OKAY.

WE'RE GONNA DOIS.

MAYBE WILL COME BACK TO IF

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:50.091

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:58.599
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT COULD.

01:33:58.666 --> 01:33:59.967
POTENTIALLY HALL R DELAYED

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:01.569

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:02.970
TO GO THROUGH THE SECRET PROCESS.

THAT BUT THANK YOU YEAH.

AND BUT OVERALL THE WAY WE'VE

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:10.491
DONE ON LEAVE WE HADN'T BEEN

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:12.226
GOING OVER THIS BILL FOR YEARS

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:13.260
NOW.

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:14.295
AND THAT WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO

01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:17.531
REALLY LOOK AT EVERYTHING THIS

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:18.465
FOR THIS PROJECT HAS GONE

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:22.069
THROUGH AND I I JUST THINK OF

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:22.736
THAT.

01:37:22.803 --> 01:37:24.772
THE THE PROPONENTS OF THIS

01:37:24.838 --> 01:37:26.540
PROJECT OF GONE THROUGH.

01:37:26.607 --> 01:37:28.509
EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:30.110
INCLUDING NEW LAWS THAT WE HAVE

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:32.079
PASSED IN THAT PROCESS THAT

01:37:32.146 --> 01:37:33.414
REQUIRE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.915
SO.

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:36.784
WENT WHEN THEIR CONCERNS ARE

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:38.686
REYES SAID THERE'S A GROUND.

01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:39.954
WATER MANAGEMENT CONCERNED I'M

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:42.089
VERY SKEPTICAL BECAUSE OF THE

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:43.324
STRICT MEASURES WE'VE PUT IN

01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:45.359
CALIFORNIA THAT.

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.927
ARE INTENDED TO PER PROTECT

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:48.662
PROTECT OUR AQUIFER'S AND KEEP

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:54.668
THEM -- KEEP THEM OF SUSTAINABLE.

01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:57.071
AND I DON'T BELIEVE I MEAN THERE

01:37:57.137 --> 01:37:59.306
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF OVER

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:00.841
DRAWING OF WATER RESOURCES

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:02.943
ACROSS THE STATE OF THAT HAVE

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:04.144
REDUCED OUR AQUIFER'S TO

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:05.446
DANGEROUS LEVELS AND I DON'T

01:38:05.512 --> 01:38:07.114
THINK THIS IS.

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:08.749
ONE THAT WITH THE CURRENT.

01:38:08.816 --> 01:38:10.184
SEE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE ARE

01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:11.619
THREAT OF THAT.

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:15.856
BUT I I AGREE THAT -- THE THE

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:16.924
PROPONENTS OF THE PROJECT THE

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:17.992
GONE THROUGH EVERY STEP.

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:20.127
HAVE HAVE GONE THROUGH A VERY

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:21.762
RIGOROUS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:24.031
PROCESS AND THEY HAVE MET EVERY

01:38:24.098 --> 01:38:25.666
REQUIREMENTS.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:27.568
AND IT'S A IT'S A TOUGH THING TO

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:29.670
DO -- IT WOULD BE UNJUST AND WE

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:31.705
WOULDN'T BE DOING OUR JOBS IF WE

01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:33.107
CONTINUE TO MOVE THE GOAL POST.

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:35.643
IN THAT PROCESS.

01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:38.646
AND AND NO I I THINK THIS BILL

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:40.180
ISN'T UNNECESSARY THINK WE HAVE

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:42.016
ENOUGH LAWS THAT WOULD HOLD THEM

01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:43.550
ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:38:43.617 --> 01:38:44.985
THIS [inaudible]

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:46.587
BOB PROJECT.

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:48.889
DOES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:49.923
ENVIRONMENT AND IF THERE ARE

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.625
IMPACTS AT THEIR MEDICATED AND I

01:38:51.692 --> 01:38:52.893
SEE.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.462
SOME ARGUMENTS INCLUDING ONES

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:57.097
THAT THIS MAY REDUCE THE

01:38:57.164 --> 01:39:00.134
SALINITY OF THE SOFT FOR OVER

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.602
THE COURSE OF TIME.

01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:02.936
THAT I THINK IS TO VISIT IS A

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:04.371
POSITIVE THING CAN HAPPEN FROM

01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:07.274
THIS BUT GENERALLY -- MUSTAPHA

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:10.744
THE BILL TODAY -- SENATOR.

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:12.813
SIMPLY BECAUSE I THINK THERE

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.115
ENOUGH CONTROLS IN PLACE THAT

01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:17.217
GOVERN THIS SPECIFIC SITE

01:39:17.284 --> 01:39:17.518
[inaudible]

01:39:17.584 --> 01:39:21.955
AND I I JUST FIND IT HARD TO

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:23.290
TAKE A POSITION HERE ON THIS

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:25.059
THAT WOULD -- PUNISH SOMEBODY

01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:26.894
THAT HAS GONE THROUGH THE

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.929
PROCESS.

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:31.465
AND SPENT.

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:32.232
A NORMA SAMANA MONEY DOING THAT

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:34.968
AND BECAUSE IT WOULD IT WOULD IT

01:39:35.035 --> 01:39:35.836
WOULD SET A DIFFERENT THEY'VE.

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:36.837
A VERY BAD PRECEDENT AND IF WE

01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:38.539
ARE PURSUING PROJECTS IN THE

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:42.076
FUTURE IN THE STATE.

01:39:42.142 --> 01:39:43.610
THEN AND THIS IS THE WAY WE DEAL

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:44.778
WITH THEM I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE

01:39:44.845 --> 01:39:46.180
ABLE TO EVER.

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:50.918
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT I THINK

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:53.887

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:20.267
HAVE PRIORITY THE WATER FROM THE

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:21.568
PROJECT.

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.003
ESTABLISH A LIFELINE A

DEDICATION FROM -- KIDDIES WHICH

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:27.007
WERE WHERE THE KIDDIES WOULD

01:42:27.074 --> 01:42:29.109
GRANT TWENTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.644
OF WATER TO THE COUNTY TO USE IN

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:32.079
ITS DISCRETION FOR USES INSIDE

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:32.946
THE COUNTY.

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:34.281
AND THEY ALSO INCLUDED A

01:42:34.348 --> 01:42:35.782
CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT SAID

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:37.851
EVEN IF RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:39.152
AND SAN MARINO COUNTY DON'T WANT

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:40.387
TO WATER NOW THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:41.989
TO OPT INTO INTO IT T A LATER

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:42.689
DATE.

01:42:42.756 --> 01:42:44.291
AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE IS THE ONLY

GROUND WATER MANSION PLAN IN

01:42:47.628 --> 01:42:48.195
CALIFORNIA THAT'S INCLUDED THOSE

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:49.963
PROVISIONS.

01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:52.199
MR ROTH TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT YOU

01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:53.200
KNOW THE COURTS HAVE RULED ON

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:54.134
THIS.

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:54.868
NUMBER AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:55.669
HAS.

01:42:55.736 --> 01:42:58.071
SOME STRONG PROTECTIONS ON IT.

01:42:58.138 --> 01:42:59.606
HI INCLUDING OF IN ON THE FLOOR

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:01.341
ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNTY THE

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:02.543
COURTS HAVE UPHELD THE COUNTIES

01:43:02.609 --> 01:43:04.545
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN WE

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:06.246
GOT SEGMENT AS IS BEEN MENTIONED --

01:43:06.313 --> 01:43:07.648
D. W. R. HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS

01:43:07.714 --> 01:43:12.853
AN AS AN OPTION -- TO OVERSEE.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.289
AND YOU'VE STATED THAT YOU'RE

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:16.757
JUST LOOKING FOR A PEN

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:18.125
ASSESSMENT THE SCIENCE.

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.327
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME IN AND I

01:43:20.394 --> 01:43:21.695
I THINK MY AGAIN MY COLLEAGUE

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:24.364
FROM SANDIEGO -- ADEQUATELY --

01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:29.503
MENTION THIS AS WELL -- IT SEEMS

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:30.804
LIKE IT'S OCCURRED.

01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:32.139
AND IT SEEMS LIKE A STRETCH THAT

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:33.407
OUR COURTS.

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:34.575
ARE NOT.

01:43:34.641 --> 01:43:36.376
TRUSTWORTHY WHEN FACING

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:37.678
QUESTIONS OF THE STATE'S

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:40.447
RESOURCES AND WE WE TRUST THE

01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:41.415
COURTS A LOT.

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:43.016
IN ON THESE KIND OF ISSUES AND

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:43.917
THE SCIENCE.

01:43:43.984 --> 01:43:45.085
HAS UNDERTAKEN WOULD YOU KNOW IF

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:47.421
YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO YOU KNOW

01:43:47.487 --> 01:43:49.122
THOSE COMMENTS [inaudible]

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:52.225
WELL SURE.

01:43:52.292 --> 01:43:54.161
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE COMMENTS

01:43:54.227 --> 01:43:57.631
THE OF COULD DISS COMMENTS.

01:43:57.698 --> 01:43:58.699
IGNORE THE FINAL REASON THAT I

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:00.200
GOT INVOLVED IN THIS BILL I'M

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:01.835
NOT KNOWN AS AN ENVIRONMENTALIST

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:02.736
I DON'T THINK I'VE TOUCHED A

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:05.038
WATER ISSUE IN THE SIX PLUS

01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:06.306
YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE.

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:07.774
BUT I'M BOTHERED BY THE FACT

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:09.610
THAT THERE IS A AT LEAST A FORTY

01:44:09.676 --> 01:44:11.278
THOUSAND ACRE FOOT WHICH IS

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:13.213
FOURTEEN BILLION GALLONS. FORTY

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.615
THOUSAND ACRE FOOT DISCREPANCY

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:16.750
IN THE SCIENCES TO WHAT CAN BE

01:44:16.817 --> 01:44:18.652
PULLED OUT OF THIS BASIN.

01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:20.120
NO.

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:21.788
THE INITIAL COMMENT BY THE

01:44:21.855 --> 01:44:24.625
KIDDIES WAS THAT SUPPORTERS ARE

01:44:24.691 --> 01:44:25.859
NOT SATISFIED WITH SEEK WERE.

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:28.495
ROSS THE COURTS HAVE RULED OF AN

01:44:28.562 --> 01:44:30.063
ANSWER QUESTIONS AND YEAH BUT I

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:32.232
I MEAN I I THINK THE COURTS OF

01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:33.500
THE COULD DIS.

01:44:33.567 --> 01:44:35.302
DOES NOT RESOLVE SCIENCE I READ

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:37.371
A QUOTE FROM THE APPELLATE

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:40.374
DECISION IN THE COULD DIS APPEAL

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.442
WHERE THE COURT SAID WE DO NOT

01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:44.978
RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN THE SCIENCE.

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:46.313
THE STANDARD IS SUBSTANTIAL

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.415
EVIDENCE WE LOOK TO SEE IF THERE

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:50.083
IS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WHICH IS

01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:51.218
ANY REASONABLE F..

01:44:51.284 --> 01:44:53.153
EVIDENCE AND THE INFERENCES THAT

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.721
CAN BE DRAWN THEREFROM TO

01:44:54.788 --> 01:44:56.390
SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION OF THE

01:44:56.456 --> 01:44:57.958
LEAD AGENCY.

01:44:58.025 --> 01:44:59.660
EVEN IN THE FACE OF MORE

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:00.861
COMPELLING.

01:45:00.927 --> 01:45:02.629
EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD SO

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:03.864
THERE'S NO RESOLUTION AND THE

01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:06.233
PROBLEM HERE THE BASIC PROBLEM

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:07.267
HERE.

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:08.435
IS.

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:10.237
THIS IN THE NORMAL COULD SEE FOR

01:45:10.303 --> 01:45:11.171
PROCESS.

01:45:11.238 --> 01:45:13.540
YOU HAVE A LEAD AGENCY THAT ACTS

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:15.108
IN A RATHER OBJECTIVE WAY.

01:45:15.175 --> 01:45:16.877
YOU SELECT EXPERTS YOU EVALUATE

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.345
THE SCIENCE YOU IS THE LEAD

01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:20.814
AGENCY RESOLVE THE CONFLICTS.

01:45:20.881 --> 01:45:22.416
YOU THEN SUBMIT YOUR FINAL E. I.

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:24.217
ARE OU APPROVE IT IT MAY BE

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:25.318
CHALLENGED IN COURT AND THEN THE

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:26.620
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TEST

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:27.621
APPLIES.

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:31.291
IN THIS CASE THERE WAS AN

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:32.292
INITIAL TUSSLE.

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:33.860
IN COURT BETWEEN THE COUNTY OF

01:45:33.927 --> 01:45:35.295
SAN BERNARDINO.

01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:35.896
AND THE SANTA MARGARITA WATER

01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:37.030
DISTRICT AS TO CENTIMETER

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:38.665
MARGARITAS DESIRE TO BE THE LEAD

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:40.934
AGENCY SAN BERNARDINO THE COUNTY

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.736
WHERE THE PROJECT IS LOCATED.

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:44.438
WANTED TO BE THE LEAD AGENCY IN

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:46.273
THE END OF THE DAY SANTA MARIA

01:45:46.339 --> 01:45:48.475
MARGARITA WHICH HAS NO GROUND

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:49.142
WATER.

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:50.444
AND HAS A THIRTY PER IS A

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:51.378
LARGEST.

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:53.380
INTEREST IN THE PUMPING PROJECT

01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:55.716
WITH THE 30% WATER INTEREST.

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:57.451
WAS THE LEAD AGENCY SO THE LEAD

01:45:57.517 --> 01:45:59.786
AGENCY IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:00.921
GETS TO PICK THE AXE.

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:03.056
AND I'VE HEARD MANY AN EXPERT IN

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.191
FORTY FIVE YEARS AS IT DOES OF

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:05.892
LITIGATION ATTORNEY AND YOU

01:46:05.959 --> 01:46:07.394
NEVER HER AN EXPERT UNLESS YOU

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:08.862
KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS GONNA BE.

01:46:08.929 --> 01:46:10.664
SO THE SANTA MARGARITA WATER

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:12.499
DISTRICT HIRES THE EXPERT PUTS

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:14.034
THE EVIDENCE IN THE E. I. R.

01:46:14.101 --> 01:46:15.769
WHEN THE IRISH CHALLENGED IN THE

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:17.671
COURTS UNDER THE SEEK WITH

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:18.538
STANDARD.

01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:20.440
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THE COURT

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:21.608
LOOKS TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY

01:46:21.675 --> 01:46:23.944
EVIDENCE IN THE E. I. R. REPORT

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:25.445
THAT SOME SORTS SUPPORTS THE

01:46:25.512 --> 01:46:27.047
CONCLUSION AND IF THERE IS.

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:28.115
THAT'S THE END OF THE

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:30.550
CONVERSATION SO WHEN YOU SAY

01:46:30.617 --> 01:46:32.953
COURTS REVIEW THERE WAS NO COURT

01:46:33.019 --> 01:46:35.622
EVALUATION AND VALIDATION OF THE

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:36.957
PARTICULAR SCIENCE HERE.

01:46:37.023 --> 01:46:38.391
I'M NOT TRYING TO STOP THE

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:39.659
PROJECT.

01:46:39.726 --> 01:46:41.261
I'M TRYING TO RESOLVE THE

01:46:41.328 --> 01:46:43.663
SCIENCE BECAUSE IF WE GET THIS

01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:45.899
WRONG.

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:47.467
EVEN UNDER COULD DISS VIEW IT'S

01:46:47.534 --> 01:46:49.069
GOING TO TAKE THIRTY YEARS TO

01:46:49.136 --> 01:46:50.837
RECHARGE THE AQUIFER RESTORE THE

01:46:50.904 --> 01:46:52.172
AQUIFER AND IN THE IN THE

01:46:52.239 --> 01:46:54.541
OPINION OF SOME SCIENTISTS.

01:46:54.608 --> 01:46:57.010
THAT THIRTY YEARS GOES TO FOUR

01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:58.512
HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS SO I

01:46:58.578 --> 01:47:00.580
DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THE BACK

01:47:00.647 --> 01:47:02.182
AND REVIEW THAT MY COLLEAGUES

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:03.784
HERE.

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:06.353
MY FRIENDS ARE ARE PROPOSING WE

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:08.054
NEED TO DO THE FRONT AND REVIEW

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:09.656
AND WITH RESPECT TO THE SAN

01:47:09.723 --> 01:47:10.690
BERNARDINO COUNTY GRAND WATER

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:11.792
GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:13.627
MONITORING PLAN.

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:17.230
THEIR FIVE YEAR REPORTS THERE'S-A TECHNICAL COMMITTEE COMPRISED

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:19.065
OF THREE THE COUNTY SANTA.

01:47:19.132 --> 01:47:20.300
MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT IN A

01:47:20.367 --> 01:47:22.569
THIRD PARTY THAT THEY PICK.

01:47:22.636 --> 01:47:24.538
THE TEN REVIEWS WHAT THEY CALL

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:26.439
ACTION CRITERIA AND IF THERE

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:28.241
ACTION CRITERIA THAT OCCUR WHICH

01:47:28.308 --> 01:47:29.709
IS A DECLINE IN THE STATIC WATER

01:47:29.776 --> 01:47:30.710
LEVELS.

01:47:30.777 --> 01:47:33.013
THEN THERE'S THIRTY DAYS AND

01:47:33.079 --> 01:47:34.147
SIXTY DAYS AN APPEALS IN THIS

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:35.048
THAT THE OTHER.

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:36.983
AND IF WE GET IT WRONG AND THE

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:38.351
WATER LEVEL IN THE BONANZA

01:47:38.418 --> 01:47:43.056
SPRINGS GOES AWAY.

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:44.858
THAT WILL HAVE.

01:47:44.925 --> 01:47:46.626
PERMANENT LASTING EFFECTS ON

01:47:46.693 --> 01:47:48.361
BIGHORN SHEEP THE VEGETATION AND

01:47:48.428 --> 01:47:49.896
THE AND THE WILDLIFE AND THE FUN

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:51.064
AND THE FLOOR AND THE MOJAVE

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:54.768
DESERT AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

01:47:54.835 --> 01:47:56.369
THANK YOU.

01:47:56.436 --> 01:47:58.238
IS THERE -- AND IF YOU WANT TO

01:47:58.305 --> 01:47:59.306
GIVE THE OPPONENTS AN

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:01.541
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS A COUPLE

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:05.478
OF THINGS -- WHY DON'T WE JUST

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:06.246
TO MAYBE CENTER BOARD JUST WANT

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:08.181
TO JUMP IN AND WE CAN FLESH THIS

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:10.116
OUT IF?

01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:12.085
YOU HAVE FURTHER COMMENTS.

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:14.421
THIS IS KIND OF REFER THIS ISSUE

01:48:14.487 --> 01:48:16.656
AND FORGIVE ME FOR A BABY BEING

01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:19.392
L. CALLOUS -- REMINDS ME OF AN

01:48:19.459 --> 01:48:20.427
INFOMERCIAL.

01:48:20.493 --> 01:48:22.062
YOU KNOW THAT SAYS IF YOU BUY

01:48:22.128 --> 01:48:22.996

FIVE YOU CAN GET SO MUCH MORE

01:48:28.368 --> 01:48:29.603
BUT WAIT THERE'S EVEN MORE.

01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:30.904
THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I SEE THIS

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:33.573
THE C. QUOTE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.941
REVIEW PROCESS PLAYING OUT.

01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:38.345
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:39.980
AND I THINK IT WAS STATED

01:48:40.046 --> 01:48:43.416
EARLIER THAT SOMETIMES -- WHEN

01:48:43.483 --> 01:48:45.085
FOLKS ADVOCATE FOR THE

01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:47.220
IMPLEMENTATION IN APPLICATION OF

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:49.489
SYKORA -- WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:51.191
IS TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED

01:48:51.258 --> 01:48:52.959
OUTCOME?

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:54.594
IT IS NOT.

01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:56.563
EARLY ON SCIENCE OR CONCERN FOR

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.531
THE ENVIRONMENT BUT TO ACHIEVE A

01:48:58.598 --> 01:48:59.966
POLITICAL OUTCOME.

01:49:00.033 --> 01:49:01.968
AND SO I GUESS WHAT I'M WHAT I'M

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:03.637
WONDERING TODAY IS.

01:49:03.703 --> 01:49:05.538
WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY -- A

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:07.007
PASSIONATE TESTIMONY OF FOLKS

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:08.575
THAT DO NOT WANT THIS PROJECT TO

01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:09.976
MOVE FORWARD AND WE'VE HEARD

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:12.078
MERITORIOUS ALSO MERITORIOUS

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:13.413
COMMENTARY.

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:16.449
OF FROM -- PROPONENTS THAT -- I

01:49:16.516 --> 01:49:18.585
BELIEVE -- SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO

01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:20.120
MOVE FORWARD HAVING JUMP THROUGH

01:49:20.186 --> 01:49:26.192
EVERY A RELEVANT APPLICABLE WHO.

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:29.062
ONE SAN DIEGO EVEN -- ATTESTED

01:49:29.129 --> 01:49:30.964
TO TO SUCH.

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:32.933
I'M KIND OF THE OPINION THAT.

01:49:32.999 --> 01:49:34.834
SOUND MINDS CAN CAN REACH

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:37.103
CONSENSUS AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:38.104
INTELLECTUALLY HONEST AND

01:49:38.171 --> 01:49:39.506
PRAGMATIC ABOUT THINGS.

01:49:39.572 --> 01:49:43.677
IS THERE A PATH FORWARD HERE.

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:46.546
FOR A A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION

01:49:46.613 --> 01:49:48.415
FOR EXAMPLE YOU SAY THAT.

01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:50.984
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE THE

01:49:51.051 --> 01:49:52.585
WATER EXTRACTION COULD BE

01:49:52.652 --> 01:49:53.820
CATASTROPHIC.

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:56.323
I'VE I'M I'M AWARE THAT THERE IS --

01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:58.892
A PROPOSAL -- OR AT LEAST ONE

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:00.927
COMPONENT IS THAT -- PUMPING

01:50:00.994 --> 01:50:03.797
WHICH SEES IF IT DIPS BELOW

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:07.033
EIGHTY FEET -- MAYBE YOU CAN

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:07.667
CORRECT ME IF I'M MISTAKEN ABOUT

01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:08.702
THAT.

01:50:08.768 --> 01:50:09.736
BUT THERE ARE SAFE IS THAT A

01:50:09.803 --> 01:50:11.538
SAFEGUARD THAT IS BUILT IN THERE

01:50:11.604 --> 01:50:12.872
YES OR NO PLEASE YES.

01:50:12.939 --> 01:50:14.574
SO I THINK WHEN WE HAVE A SAFE

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:16.042
CORD LIKE THAT THAT BUILDS

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:17.344
CONFIDENCE.

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:19.379
NOW I'M WONDERING IS THERE ANY

01:50:19.446 --> 01:50:20.747
OTHER PROPOSAL THAT.

01:50:20.814 --> 01:50:22.615
HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD OR BABY HAS

01:50:22.682 --> 01:50:24.484
YET TO BE PUT FOR NOW YOU'LL MY

01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:26.152
TIME IN THAT REGARD.

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:28.755
THAT -- CAN LOOK AFTER THE

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:30.223
ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS.

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.658
AND CREATE THE SAFEGUARDS IT

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:33.193
SHOULD THERE BE.

01:50:33.259 --> 01:50:36.029
SCIENTIFICALLY DEMONSTRABLE --

01:50:36.096 --> 01:50:45.405
EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS -- I'D

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:46.172
DAMAGE BEING DONE TO THE

01:50:46.239 --> 01:50:47.374
ENVIRONMENT OR LIKELY DAMAGE TO

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.041
INTO.

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:49.409
THAT THERE BE US THAT THERE BE --

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:51.244
REVERSAL OF COURSE OPPORTUNITIES

01:50:51.311 --> 01:50:52.779
SO MAYBE WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE

01:50:52.846 --> 01:50:55.782
TO HEAR OTHER ANY IDEAS -- THAT

01:50:55.849 --> 01:50:58.985
COULD BE PUT FORWARD.

01:50:59.052 --> 01:51:01.321
ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES.

01:51:01.388 --> 01:51:03.356
YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND IN IDEAS

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:04.924
I THINK IT'S A CALL IS IN OUR

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.159
CITY FOR IDEAS.

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:09.095
ABOUT.

01:51:09.162 --> 01:51:10.530
AS SENATOR.

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:11.865
YOUR BILL WELL MISTER.

01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:12.699
WELL FIRST OF ALL A MAYBE MISTER

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:13.833
SLATER COULD POINTED OUT TO ME

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:14.968
BUT I HAVEN'T FOUND IT IN THE

01:51:15.035 --> 01:51:15.869
SAND WATER IN THE SENATE IN A

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:17.237
GROW WATER MANAGEMENT MONITORING

01:51:17.303 --> 01:51:18.271
PLAN.

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:19.506
THERE'S A REFERENCE TO EIGHTY

01:51:19.572 --> 01:51:20.173
FEET BUT THAT THERE'S NOT

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:22.275
LANGUAGE ABOUT A HARD STOP THE

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:23.743
TECHNICAL COMMITTEE LOOKS AT THE

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:25.278
ACTION CRITERIA AND THERE'S A

01:51:25.345 --> 01:51:27.514
PROCESS BY WHICH THE COMMITTEE

01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:30.216
REVIEWS AND ANALYZES -- THINGS

01:51:30.283 --> 01:51:31.317
LIKE THAT THAT'S MY

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:32.886
UNDERSTANDING OF MY READ OF THE

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:33.920
GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT AND

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:35.989
MONITORING PLAN I DIDN'T DRAFTED

01:51:36.056 --> 01:51:36.523
SO.

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:38.158
OF WHAT PERHAPS I WILL DEFER OF

01:51:38.224 --> 01:51:39.259
THOSE WHO DID.

01:51:39.325 --> 01:51:41.361
OF LET ME ADDRESS THE ISSUE

01:51:41.428 --> 01:51:43.196
ABOUT ALTERNATIVES -- I'M

01:51:43.263 --> 01:51:45.198
CERTAINLY OPEN TO CONVERSATION

01:51:45.265 --> 01:51:46.666
FRANKLY IF YOU KNOW I CAME TO

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:48.101
THIS THING AT THE END OF AUGUST

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:50.236
OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND

01:51:50.303 --> 01:51:52.205
BETWEEN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND

01:51:52.272 --> 01:51:54.507
EIGHTEEN AND AND CERTAINLY TILL

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:56.743
THE END OF LAST WEEK -- OF I'VE

01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:58.678
HAD VERY LITTLE CONVERSATION --

01:51:58.745 --> 01:52:00.613
WITH THE KIDDIES PROPONENTS

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:02.382
ABOUT WHAT I WHAT BROUGHT ME TO

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:03.983
THE TABLE WHICH IS THE FRONT AND

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:05.418
THE VLUATION.

01:52:05.485 --> 01:52:07.353
AND ASSESSMENT AND SETTING OF AN

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.155
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE --

01:52:09.222 --> 01:52:11.024
PUMPING RATE I'M NOT SATISFIED

01:52:11.091 --> 01:52:12.459
THAT THE GROW WATER MANAGEMENT

01:52:12.525 --> 01:52:14.661
MONITORING PLAN -- DOES THAT

01:52:14.727 --> 01:52:16.696
WITH ENOUGH -- AGILITY AND

01:52:16.763 --> 01:52:18.064
FLEXIBILITY TO CATCH ANY

01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:19.933
PROBLEMS AND EIGHTY FOUR DROP IN

01:52:19.999 --> 01:52:21.167
THE OXFORD IS FUNNY WATER IN THE

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:22.936
AQUIFER THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:52:23.002 --> 01:52:24.337
THE ISSUE THE ISSUE IS THE

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:25.805
IMPACT.

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:27.540
I AGREE I CAN'T EITHER THE ISSUE

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:29.409
IS THE IMPACT TO THE BONANZA

01:52:29.476 --> 01:52:30.643
SPRINGS IN ANY OTHER SPRINGS

01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:32.312
THAT HAPPEN TO BE IN INTER

01:52:32.378 --> 01:52:34.314
CONNECTED WITH THE AQUIFER.

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:36.149
THERE IS A SCIENTIFIC DISPUTE

01:52:36.216 --> 01:52:36.916
ABOUT HAVING TO DO WITH ICE OF

01:52:36.983 --> 01:52:38.852
ISOTOPES AN ANALYSIS OF WATER IN

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:40.220
TEMPERATURE AND WE'RE AS TO

01:52:40.286 --> 01:52:41.287
WHETHER THOSE SPRINGS ARE

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:42.989
INTERCONNECTED WHICH NEEDS TO BE

01:52:43.056 --> 01:52:44.357
RESOLVED BECAUSE IF THERE IS AN

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:45.492
INTER CONNECTION.

01:52:45.558 --> 01:52:48.962
A DROP OF ONE TO TWO TO THREE TO

01:52:49.028 --> 01:52:49.529
SIX FEET IN FINANCES BRINGS

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:50.663
COULD HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARILY

01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:51.998
DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON ON

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:53.500
WILDLIFE AND THE AND THE

01:52:53.566 --> 01:52:54.734
VEGETATION.

01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:56.503
A COULD EASE -- AS I RECALL

01:52:56.569 --> 01:52:58.238
ADMITS IN SOME OF ITS OWN

01:52:58.304 --> 01:52:59.506
FILINGS THAT THE PUMPING WILL

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:02.142
RESULT IN A IN A DROP OF OF

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:04.711
SEVERAL FEET IN BONANZA SPRINGS.

01:53:04.777 --> 01:53:06.246
AT LEAST IN SOME OF THE FILINGS

01:53:06.312 --> 01:53:07.480
AND SO WE NEED TO RESOLVE THAT

01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:14.687
IN MY READY TO SIT DOWN AND TALK

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:16.289
ABOUT ALL TO IT IS AS LONG AS IT

01:53:16.356 --> 01:53:17.090
INVOLVES THE FRONT END

01:53:17.157 --> 01:53:17.690
ASSESSMENT ABSOLUTELY -- AND

01:53:17.757 --> 01:53:18.324
WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT SHOULD

01:53:18.391 --> 01:53:19.192
THIS BILL MOVE OUT OF THIS

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:20.727
COMMITTEE ON THE WAY TO LET ME

01:53:20.793 --> 01:53:21.594
AND LET ME JUST SEIZE ON THAT

01:53:21.661 --> 01:53:23.429
INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR IT TO GO

01:53:23.496 --> 01:53:24.964
THROUGH ITS NEST NEXT ITERATIONS

01:53:25.031 --> 01:53:27.867
OF VARIOUS COMMITTEES -- BECAUSE

01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:31.070
WE'VE SEEN IT SOMETIMES IT WORKS

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:32.005
SOMETIMES IT IT DOESN'T.

01:53:32.071 --> 01:53:33.173
THESE PER GIVE ME FOR PUTTING ON

01:53:33.239 --> 01:53:35.141
THE ON THE ON THE SPOT HERE --

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:37.210
ARE YOU OPEN TO THE IDEA OF SOME

01:53:37.277 --> 01:53:41.047
SORT OF ANNUAL REVIEW -- YOU GET

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:42.582
MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THERE

01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:46.085
WOULD BE -- ALLY A DIRECT --

01:53:46.152 --> 01:53:53.593
TRUSTEE MEMBERSHIP ALLOWED --

THAT SEEM SATISFACTORY DO YOU TO

01:53:57.297 --> 01:53:59.032
ACTUALLY INVITE D. W.OR TO BE

01:53:59.098 --> 01:54:00.867
PART OF THIS THIS TRUSTEE GROUP

01:54:00.934 --> 01:54:04.103
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH

01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:05.371
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT I'VE

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:06.306
HAD WITH EVERY SINGLE

01:54:06.372 --> 01:54:08.408
CONVERSATION I'VE HAD WITH

01:54:08.474 --> 01:54:09.709
REPRESENTATIVES OF GOODIES.

01:54:09.776 --> 01:54:12.278
AND IT FOCUSES ON A BACK IN

01:54:12.345 --> 01:54:12.579
[inaudible]

01:54:12.645 --> 01:54:14.047

FRONT END OF MAY.

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:23.389
THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S SAYING

01:54:23.456 --> 01:54:25.358
SENATOR MOVEMENT MAYBE I

01:54:25.425 --> 01:54:25.959
DESTRUCTION SO WORDS IN YOUR

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:27.760
MOUTH IF MISTER SLATER WILL

01:54:27.827 --> 01:54:29.862
COMMIT. TO A FRONT END REVIEW BY

01:54:29.929 --> 01:54:30.697
INDEPENDENT SCIENCE -- THAT'S

01:54:30.763 --> 01:54:31.531
DIFFERENT I'M TALKING ABOUT I'M

01:54:31.598 --> 01:54:32.532
DID NOT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:54:32.599 --> 01:54:33.833
COMMISSION CONVENING TO ROUTE TO

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:35.134
START A THROUGH Z. ALL OVER

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:36.536
AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:38.204
TALKING I'M TALKING ABOUT IT.

01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:40.440
SOMETHING FAR MORE PRAGMATIC

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.542
TOLD MISTER SLATER.

01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:43.776
AND HIS REPRESENTATIVES.

01:54:43.843 --> 01:54:45.345
THAT IF THEY WANT TO SET A TIME

01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:47.213
LINE FOR THIS LET'S FIGURE OUT

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.014
HOW LONG IT TAKES IN SET A

01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:48.815
TIMELINE.

01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:51.117
I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT RE DOING

01:54:51.184 --> 01:54:52.852
A SEQUEL REVIEW PROCESS.

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:54.254
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT RESOLVING

01:54:54.320 --> 01:55:07.166
SINCE VERY SERIOUS CONFLICTS IN

01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:07.800
THE IN THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:09.302
MISTER SLATER HAS AN INNOVATIVE

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:09.969
THEORY HAVING TO DO WITH

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:12.071
EVAPORATION IN THE MOJAVE DESERT

01:55:12.138 --> 01:55:12.939
IN AQUIFER'S IN.

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:13.840
BACK FLOWS IN ALL OF IT TO

01:55:13.906 --> 01:55:14.741
CAPTURE OF ABERRATION TO TO COME

01:55:14.807 --> 01:55:15.742
UP WITH THE FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE

01:55:15.808 --> 01:55:17.176
FEET OTHER SCIENTISTS TO DATE.

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:18.144
AS I READ THE REPORTS DO NOT

01:55:18.211 --> 01:55:19.545
SEEM TO AGREE NOW IF I'VE TOLD

01:55:19.612 --> 01:55:21.147
MISTER SLATER THAT IF HIS

01:55:21.214 --> 01:55:22.982
INNOVATIVE PROPOSAL HAVING TO DO

01:55:24.517 --> 01:55:25.918
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE RATE

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:27.620
OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER

01:55:27.687 --> 01:55:28.288
YEAR.

OF WATER DRAWING I DON'T THAT

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:32.358
AQUIFER I'M ALL FOR THAT BUT IT

NEEDS WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:35.328
SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON THAT

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:37.864

FOR HERE IF THERE'S A WAY. TO TO

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:41.801
TO MODIFY THE LANGUAGE OF THE

BILL IN A DIFFERENT FASHION TO

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:44.070
MAKE.

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:45.805
MISTER SLATER AND HIS COMPANY

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:48.808
HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE

01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:49.676
PROCESS.

01:55:49.742 --> 01:55:50.643
I'M HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH

CHEAP SOMETIMES IT'S WARRANTED I

01:56:11.831 --> 01:56:12.965
THINK IN THIS SITUATION THERE

01:56:13.032 --> 01:56:14.334
MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.135

REVIEW AND ACTUALLY DO BETTER

01:56:36.356 --> 01:56:37.123
THAN THAT OUR INTENTION WAS TO

01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:38.358
INVITE D. W. R. INTO.

01:56:38.424 --> 01:56:38.925
A SHARED MANAGEMENT

01:56:38.991 --> 01:56:39.726
RESPONSIBILITY WHICH GAVE THEM

01:56:39.792 --> 01:56:41.127
THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:42.128
LONG.

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:43.396
REVIEW.

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:45.698
WHICH INCLUDES ANNUAL REVIEWS

01:56:45.765 --> 01:56:47.800
AND THEN FIVE YOU'RE REQUIRED

01:56:47.867 --> 01:56:48.935
ADJUSTMENTS ON ADAPTIVE

01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:50.703
MANAGEMENT AND THERE IS A RAMP

01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:52.638
IN PERIOD SO WOULD NOBODY'S

01:56:52.705 --> 01:56:54.540
DELIVERING WATER TOMORROW.

01:56:54.607 --> 01:56:55.942
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE SO THERE'S

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.744
THERE THE INTENTION WAS IS THAT

01:56:57.810 --> 01:56:59.445
D. W. R. WOULD BE SET BE PUT

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:00.780
INTO THAT MANAGEMENT

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.515
RESPONSIBILITY NOW.

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:04.584
TODAY OR WHENEVER THIS BILL WAS

01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:06.786
EFFECTIVE IF AND IF NOT BEFORE

01:57:06.853 --> 01:57:07.653
SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.022
OPPORTUNITY TODAY JUST TO FOCUS

01:57:10.089 --> 01:57:10.957
THE CONVERSATION I THINK.

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:14.026
THE WHAT I HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR

01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:15.528
IS FRONT END.

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:17.430
PRE REVIEW RATE SO WE'RE TIED I

01:57:17.497 --> 01:57:18.131
GUESS I APPRECIATE THE THE

01:57:18.197 --> 01:57:19.265
FLUSHING OUT WHAT AN ADAPTIVE

01:57:19.332 --> 01:57:20.633
MANAGEMENT PLAN WOULD LOOK LIKE

01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:22.468
BUT I THINK WITH CENTER BOARD IS

01:57:22.535 --> 01:57:23.269
GETTING AT WAS SENATE ROTH IS

01:57:23.336 --> 01:57:25.271
GETTING AS THE FRONT END SO

01:57:25.338 --> 01:57:26.339
WHAT'S THE AND SO.

01:57:26.406 --> 01:57:28.141
THE PAIN HAVING SPENT SOME TIME --

01:57:28.207 --> 01:57:29.742
THIS RECENTLY AS THIS MORNING

01:57:29.809 --> 01:57:30.743
WAS SENATOR ROTH.

01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:32.044
I THINK THAT.

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:34.247
AGAIN OUR INTENTION WOULD BE.

01:57:34.313 --> 01:57:36.015
D. W. R. WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:38.251
ENABLED TO BEGIN REVIEWING

01:57:38.317 --> 01:57:40.052
ANYTHING I WANTED BUT BUT HE

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:43.322
WOULD BE MY TO JUST.

01:57:43.389 --> 01:57:44.557
JUMP TO THE POINT.

01:57:44.624 --> 01:57:46.092
THE THE THE PRIMARY CONCERN IS

01:57:46.159 --> 01:57:48.161
IS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE

01:57:48.227 --> 01:57:49.762
PROJECT INTERFERE WITH THE

01:57:49.829 --> 01:57:50.263
SPRINGS IN THE ADJACENT

01:57:50.329 --> 01:57:52.765
WATERSHED.

01:57:52.832 --> 01:57:53.966
IT'S NOT ABOUT WITH WITH ALL DUE

01:57:54.033 --> 01:57:55.601
RESPECT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER

01:57:55.668 --> 01:57:56.569
THE PUMPING RAY ARE THAT

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:58.838
RECHARGE RATE IS THIRTY ONE

01:57:58.905 --> 01:58:01.040
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED OR

01:58:01.107 --> 01:58:01.641
NINETEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED

01:58:01.707 --> 01:58:02.608
IT'S REALLY WHETHER THAT THE

01:58:02.675 --> 01:58:03.576
CONSEQUENCES.

01:58:03.643 --> 01:58:04.777
WILL CAUSE AN IMPACT IN THE

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:06.412
SPECIFIC IMPACT OF CONCERN IN

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:08.748
THIS IN THIS WATERSHED IS FIRST

01:58:08.815 --> 01:58:10.183
AND FOREMOST SORT OF THE CANARY

01:58:10.249 --> 01:58:11.250
IN THE COAL MINE.

01:58:11.317 --> 01:58:12.819
THE DEMANDS OF SPRING IN THE

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.387
POTENTIAL THAT WOULD -- WOULD

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:17.256
HARM OTHER -- SPRINGS IN THE

01:58:17.323 --> 01:58:18.257
HIGHER UP IN THE WATERSHED SO

01:58:18.324 --> 01:58:19.792
FIRST OF ALL THE INTENTION I

01:58:19.859 --> 01:58:21.360
THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD BE

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:23.296
WILLING AS A PART OF THE NOTION

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:25.765
OF INTRODUCING D. W. R. INTO THE

01:58:25.832 --> 01:58:30.803
TRUSTEE ROLE. TO DO A A AND NOW.

01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:31.704
ASSESSMENT OF THE

01:58:31.771 --> 01:58:33.906
INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE THE

01:58:33.973 --> 01:58:35.508
ALLUVIAL AQUIFER WERE PUMPING

01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:37.910
FROM IN THE SPRING WE WE WILLING

01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:39.378
TO DO THAT TODAY.

01:58:39.445 --> 01:58:40.513
THAT'S THE FIRST PIECE BUT I

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:42.415
ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:43.749
E. I. ARE ALREADY.

01:58:43.816 --> 01:58:44.984
DID TWO THINGS IT CAME TO THE

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:46.552
CONCLUSION THAT THERE WASN'T A

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:47.820
HYDRAULIC CONNECTION.

01:58:47.887 --> 01:58:49.188
BUT THEN FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT

01:58:49.255 --> 01:58:51.057
MODEL WHAT THE IMPACTS WOULD BE

01:58:51.123 --> 01:58:52.825
INCLUDED THAT THEY WERE NOT

01:58:52.892 --> 01:58:53.626
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:56.362
THE AT VARIATION WITHIN THE BAND

01:58:56.429 --> 01:58:58.130
WITH THE WHAT HAPPENS NATURALLY.

01:58:58.197 --> 01:58:59.465
SO THAT WAS IN THE AYE ARE IN I

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:01.133
ALSO WANT TO SAY THE COUNTY LOOK

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.435
AT THAT TO THE COUNTY WAS NOT

01:59:02.502 --> 01:59:04.070
BOUND BY THE I. R. AND THE TRIAL

01:59:04.136 --> 01:59:04.904
COURT.

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:06.439
REVIEW THAT FINDING SO IN THE

01:59:06.506 --> 01:59:09.141
END WE WOULD AGREE TO THAT FOCUS

01:59:09.208 --> 01:59:09.342
STUDY.

01:59:09.408 --> 01:59:17.149
NOW. FOR YOU WANNA JUMP INTO

01:59:17.216 --> 01:59:19.085
THIS AND I'LL COME BACK TO

01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:19.452
CENTER JACKSON.

01:59:19.519 --> 01:59:20.753
I DO.

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:21.621
ON THE I JUST WONDER WAS THAT A

01:59:21.687 --> 01:59:24.123
YES OR NO. TO THE PROPOSAL OF

01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:25.825
DOING ADVANCE I APOLOGIZE

01:59:25.892 --> 01:59:27.527
CENTERS BUT BUT IN IT IS SORT OF

01:59:27.593 --> 01:59:29.495
THE FINAL CONCLUSION TO THAT

01:59:29.562 --> 01:59:30.329
CONVERSATION I DON'T KNOW IF

01:59:30.396 --> 01:59:32.064
THERE'S A FINAL CONCLUSION YET

01:59:32.131 --> 01:59:33.432
TO THAT COVERS ALL RIGHT OKAY I

01:59:33.499 --> 01:59:35.835
JUST THOUGHT IT WAS WE COULD

01:59:35.902 --> 01:59:38.037
MOVE ALONG.

01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:39.839
NOT YEAH WE'RE GETTING THERE.

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:41.574
DID BY BIT.

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:44.810
NO IT'S OKAY -- COUPLE COMMENTS

01:59:44.877 --> 01:59:45.278
A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:47.446
SUGGESTIONS BASED UPON THE

01:59:47.513 --> 01:59:48.981
SENATORS GOOD THE PRICE YOUR

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:50.283
FIRST.

01:59:50.349 --> 01:59:51.384
I AM IS CHAIRMAN.

01:59:51.450 --> 01:59:53.219
COMPELLED BY THE ARGUMENT THAT

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:54.921
SOMEBODY WHO JUMP THROUGH ALL

01:59:54.987 --> 01:59:56.088
THE HOOPS.

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:58.324
LITIGATE EVERYTHING AND WE COME

01:59:58.391 --> 02:00:00.960
AS A LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST DAY

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:03.095
AND TRY TO CHANGE THE RULES IS

02:00:03.162 --> 02:00:04.564
WRONG.

02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:06.265
I SEEN IT IN OTHER BODIES AND

02:00:06.332 --> 02:00:07.600
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN.

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:10.036
IT IS A COMPELLING ARGUMENT.

02:00:10.102 --> 02:00:11.971
BUT FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:15.808
THIS CASE WHICH I THINK BECAUSE

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:17.410
A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION.

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.345
AND THE BECAUSE LOOK YOU KNOW

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:20.513
YOU YOU YOU GOTHROUGH ALL THIS

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:21.881
STUFF AND WHAT'S THE POINT IF

02:00:21.948 --> 02:00:23.015
EVERY TIME THE GOVERNMENT CAN

02:00:23.082 --> 02:00:24.083
JUST SIMPLY CHANGE THE RULES THE

02:00:24.150 --> 02:00:25.117
END OF THE GAME.

02:00:25.184 --> 02:00:26.185
IT'S A FAIR QUESTION ON EITHER

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:27.219
SIDE NO MATTER WHAT THE

02:00:27.286 --> 02:00:29.055
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE HAVE TO

02:00:29.121 --> 02:00:30.823
JUDGE THESE THINGS YOU KNOW WE

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:32.191
HAVE WAS IN THE STORE CONTEXT

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:33.626
DEPENDING ON WHO'S IN POWER

02:00:33.693 --> 02:00:35.795
THERE'S A PROCESS AND RULE OF

02:00:35.861 --> 02:00:37.163
LAW WE SHOULD FOLLOW IT.

02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:37.797
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS CASE

02:00:37.863 --> 02:00:41.934
ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE CRITICAL.

02:00:42.001 --> 02:00:42.868
ONE IS THAT ARMED.

02:00:42.935 --> 02:00:44.670
YOU KNOW THE THE LEAD AGENCY HAD

02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:46.372
A THUMB ON THE SCALE THEY HAD AN

02:00:46.439 --> 02:00:48.374
INTEREST IN THE DEAL.

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:49.775
SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT

02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:55.214
HAD INTEREST AND THERE ARE TO ME.

02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:56.649
NO NO DISRESPECT TO THEM BUT

02:00:56.716 --> 02:00:57.550
IT'S JUST TO MAKE IT IT'S

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:59.318
SOMETHING THAT FUNDAMENTAL IT'S

02:00:59.385 --> 02:00:59.885
LIKE CHANGING A CASE IN THE

02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:00.252
SUPREME COURT.

02:01:00.319 --> 02:01:01.053
THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO THE

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.789
OUTCOME OF THE OF THE MATTER.

02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:05.424
AND YOU CAN'T IGNORE THAT IN

02:01:05.491 --> 02:01:07.460
TERMS OF HAVING AN INDEPENDENT

02:01:07.526 --> 02:01:08.461
REVIEW.

02:01:08.527 --> 02:01:09.962
WHAT SENATE ROTH INDICATED OF

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:11.831
COURSES FIRING EXPERT WITNESSES

02:01:11.897 --> 02:01:13.265
YOU ALWAYS WANT THE OUTCOME AND

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:14.767
I DON'T BLAME SOMEBODY FOR DOING

02:01:14.834 --> 02:01:16.068
THAT BUT THEIR OBLIGATION IS

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:17.436
DIFFERENT THAN OURS ARE JOB IN

02:01:17.503 --> 02:01:18.437
THE GOVERNMENT?

02:01:18.504 --> 02:01:20.506
IS TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH AND

02:01:20.573 --> 02:01:21.340
FAIRNESS OF PROCESS.

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:23.175
BOB AND THE SECOND THING IS THE

02:01:23.242 --> 02:01:25.344
CLIMATE CHANGE ARGUMENT IN THE

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:28.581
SENSE THAT THE SCIENCE IS SOUL

02:01:28.648 --> 02:01:29.281
FOR PARK.

02:01:29.348 --> 02:01:30.850
YOU DON'T FORTY THOUSAND ACRE

02:01:30.916 --> 02:01:33.386
FEET IS A LOT OF WATER I MEAN I

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.253
IT'S A CITY OF WHAT.

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.855
FORWARD FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:36.555
PEOPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:37.156
DENNIS AUTO IT'S A PRETTY BIG

02:01:37.223 --> 02:01:38.257
NUMBER IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

02:01:38.324 --> 02:01:39.925
DISTRICT NUMBERS ARE AND THE

02:01:39.992 --> 02:01:41.193
UNIQUE NATURE OF THE SOCCER FOR

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:42.628
THAT THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:43.295
AROUND FOR MANY YEARS ARE KEENLY

02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:44.864
AWARE OF SO.

02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:46.966
THE QUESTION IS FAIR I MEAN I

02:01:47.033 --> 02:01:48.567
THINK THAT THE CONSULTANT A

02:01:48.634 --> 02:01:50.169
MISTER CONNOR SAID CLEARLY IN

02:01:50.236 --> 02:01:51.837
TERMS OF WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:54.073
HERE IN IS IN ON PAGE NINE OF

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:54.974
HIS ANALYSIS.

02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:56.676
THIS IS WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF

02:01:56.742 --> 02:01:58.544
THE PROPONENTS THERE AT LEAST

02:01:58.611 --> 02:01:59.945
TWO CAMPS ONE GROUP WAS COOLEY

02:02:00.012 --> 02:02:00.479
TRYING TO SIMPLY KILL THE

02:02:00.546 --> 02:02:01.514
PROJECT.

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.249
THERE WON'T BE SATISFIED INTO

02:02:03.315 --> 02:02:04.450
THE PROJECTS TOTALLY ABANDONED.

02:02:04.517 --> 02:02:06.018
ANOTHER GROUP SIMPLY WANTS TO

02:02:06.085 --> 02:02:07.119
ENSURE THE PROJECT IS SIZED

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:08.988
APPROPRIATELY WHATEVER THAT SIZE

02:02:09.055 --> 02:02:10.222
MIGHT BE.

02:02:10.289 --> 02:02:12.491
THE AUTHOR APPEARS TO BE FIRMLY

02:02:12.558 --> 02:02:19.031
IN THIS SECOND CAMP I AGREE WITH

02:02:19.098 --> 02:02:20.499
THAT DIAGNOSTIC.

02:02:20.566 --> 02:02:21.200
HE CLEARLY IS IN THAT SECOND

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:22.401
CAMP I I BELIEVE HIM IN TERMS OF

02:02:22.468 --> 02:02:24.570
WHERE HE'S AT I BELIEVE THERE'S

02:02:24.637 --> 02:02:25.237
OTHER PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT CAN'T.

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:25.805
FIND THAT'S YOUR RIGHT IN

02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:26.739
DEMOCRACY TO BE IN THAT CAMP SO

02:02:26.806 --> 02:02:28.274
HE WANTS TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS

02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:30.042
CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE.

02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:31.444
SO GOING TO WHAT CENTER BOARD

02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:33.045
JUST SAYS IS THERE A SOLUTION TO

02:02:33.112 --> 02:02:35.281
THIS THING WHAT I HAD SUGGESTED

02:02:35.347 --> 02:02:36.949
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH GERMAN IN

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:38.951
THE OR THE PROPONENT OTHERS WAS

02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:40.186
TWO THINGS THAT.

02:02:40.252 --> 02:02:42.688
INFORM THE PROBLEM IF IN FACT

02:02:42.755 --> 02:02:46.325
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO

02:02:46.392 --> 02:02:47.760
REALLY TEST THE SCIENCE.

02:02:47.827 --> 02:02:50.229
IF IN FACT YOU HAVE A HAPPY Là

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:52.498
MCCOY PALESTINIANS AND THE JEWS.

02:02:52.565 --> 02:02:53.866
THANK WERE NEITHER SIDE TRUST

02:02:53.933 --> 02:02:55.901
EACH OTHER HOW DO YOU CREATE A

02:02:55.968 --> 02:03:00.106
PROCESS THAT PEOPLE TRUST. ONE

02:03:00.172 --> 02:03:01.640
YOU PUT A TIME LINE ON IT.

02:03:01.707 --> 02:03:02.975
YOU PUT A TIME LINE ON IT YOU

02:03:03.042 --> 02:03:04.710
SAY THAT OKAY WE'RE GONNA DO

02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:06.378
THIS DIAGNOSTIC BUT THIS ISN'T

02:03:06.445 --> 02:03:07.680
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE JUST GOING

02:03:07.747 --> 02:03:09.482
TO DELAY FOREVER BECAUSE NO ONE

02:03:09.548 --> 02:03:10.683
TRUSTS THE PARTIES LET'S PUT A

02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:12.184
TIME LINE.

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:14.153
THAT SAYS THAT THIS SCIENCE

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.654
REFUTES SCIENTIFIC REVIEW TO BE

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:17.123
ABLE TO BE CERTAIN BECAUSE THE

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:18.991
CONSEQUENCES OF OF A MISTAKE IN

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:20.059
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCE

02:03:20.126 --> 02:03:21.527
PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO

02:03:21.594 --> 02:03:23.996
THIS PROPERTY WHICH IS SO UNIQUE.

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:25.064
IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE THIS

02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:27.099
TRUCK CANTIK AQUIFER THAT WAS

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:29.635
DISCOVERED GUT THIRTY SOME YEARS

02:03:29.702 --> 02:03:31.103
AGO FORTY WHATEVERIT WAS BACK

02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:32.171
WILL DISCOVERED IT.

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:34.206
BUT THE POINT IS THAT.

02:03:34.273 --> 02:03:36.275
ALL YOU PUT A TIME ON IT.

02:03:36.342 --> 02:03:37.243
AND THE TEST SHOULD BE DONE TO

02:03:37.309 --> 02:03:38.744
DETERMINE BY WHAT WE SAY BUT

02:03:38.811 --> 02:03:39.378
WHAT THE SCIENTISTS AT HOW MUCH

02:03:39.445 --> 02:03:40.179
TIME TO THE THE SIX MONTHS THAT

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:41.514
YEAR WHATEVER IT IS AND PUSH

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:44.116
THEM TO BASICALLY GET TO THE

02:03:44.183 --> 02:03:44.750
TRUTH.

02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:46.152
WHATEVER IT IS IT IS FACTUAL

02:03:46.218 --> 02:03:48.921
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES THE AUTHOR

02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:49.622
SAYS LET THE SCIENCE SPEAK.

02:03:49.688 --> 02:03:50.556
TO I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

02:03:50.623 --> 02:03:52.158
THIS QUESTION BUT IT'S CERTAINLY

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:52.758
BEEN REYES AND I SHOULD TYPE

02:03:52.825 --> 02:03:55.427
PROPOSED TO THE CHAIR IS ONE OF

02:03:55.494 --> 02:03:57.963
THE LAST QUESTION IS HIS WHO ARE

02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:59.365
THE WHO'S THE JUDGE AND JURY.

02:03:59.431 --> 02:04:00.566
ONE OF THE REASONS THERE'S THE

02:04:00.633 --> 02:04:02.268
CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO SANTA

02:04:02.334 --> 02:04:03.469
MARGARITA IS THEY HAVE A FARM ON

02:04:03.536 --> 02:04:05.437
THE SCALE THEY HAD AN INTEREST

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:07.640
IN THE OUTCOME WHICH SHOULD

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:08.908
NEVER HAVE BEEN THE CASE TONIGHT

02:04:08.974 --> 02:04:09.742
BUT I KNOW THAT CENTER OFFICE

02:04:09.809 --> 02:04:10.476
RIGHT WITH RESPECT TO THE

02:04:10.543 --> 02:04:12.011
STANDARD REVIEW.

02:04:12.077 --> 02:04:13.078
OF THE COURT CASE AND THE I

02:04:13.145 --> 02:04:21.053
AGREE WITH HIS ANALYSIS SO HOW

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:22.655
DO YOU GET IN IN THE AN ENTITY

02:04:22.721 --> 02:04:23.856
IT WAS SUGGESTEDIN THE ANALYSIS

02:04:23.923 --> 02:04:25.257
SOME OPTIONS I'M AGNOSTIC ON

02:04:25.324 --> 02:04:26.692
WHAT THOSE ARE -- THERE'S AN

02:04:26.759 --> 02:04:27.359
OPINION WELL PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE

02:04:27.426 --> 02:04:27.960
AN OPINION THE PROJECT'S BEEN

02:04:28.027 --> 02:04:29.061
AROUND A LONG TIME FAIR ARGUMENT

02:04:29.128 --> 02:04:31.864
BUT AGAIN GET TO THE POINT WHERE.

02:04:31.931 --> 02:04:33.532
YOU DON'T RESPECT THE LEGITIMACY

02:04:33.599 --> 02:04:35.100
OF WHAT THE AUTHORS BRINGING.

02:04:35.167 --> 02:04:37.469
POINT TAKEN CHECK DONE. TO

02:04:37.536 --> 02:04:39.705
CREATE A A PROCESS THAT IS TOO

02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:43.008
QUICK SO THAT NO VINCE IS NOT

02:04:43.075 --> 02:04:44.176
ABOUT DELAY BUT IT'S ABOUT.

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:46.178
GETTING TO THE ISSUES TO WHICH

02:04:46.245 --> 02:04:46.846
THE CAMP THAT.

02:04:46.912 --> 02:04:49.682
THE GENERAL OFFICE INVOLVED AND

02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:51.150
THREE ANOTHER ONLY ANSWER THIS

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:52.184
ONE I ONLY RAISE IT.

02:04:52.251 --> 02:04:54.286
MAKE SURE THAT THE JUDGE AND

02:04:54.353 --> 02:04:56.889
JURY OF THAT DATA IS SOMEBODY

02:04:56.956 --> 02:04:58.224
WHO EVER BOTH SIDES HAV

02:04:58.290 --> 02:05:00.226
CONFIDENCE IN YOU GET TO THE END

02:05:00.292 --> 02:05:01.994
GAME THAT CENTER BOARDS I THINK

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:04.196
IS THE ANSWER. TO ADDRESS THE

02:05:04.263 --> 02:05:06.131
LEGITIMACY OF BUT AVOID A AN

02:05:06.198 --> 02:05:07.700
ISSUE WITH THE BOTH SIDES ARE IN

02:05:07.766 --> 02:05:09.969
THE GAME AND CUT TO THE CHASE OF

02:05:10.035 --> 02:05:11.136
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I DON'T

02:05:11.203 --> 02:05:12.438
HAVE THE ANSWER IN TERMS A JUDGE

02:05:12.504 --> 02:05:13.539
AND JURY BUT I CERTAINLY THINK A

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:14.406
TIME LINE.

02:05:14.473 --> 02:05:16.609
AS GENERAL TALKED ABOUT WOULD BE

02:05:16.675 --> 02:05:17.910
A REASONABLE SOLUTION.

02:05:17.977 --> 02:05:19.612
BUT OTHERWISE I THINK THAT HE'S

02:05:19.678 --> 02:05:22.248
CORRECT WITH RESPECT TO THE NEED

02:05:22.314 --> 02:05:23.482
TO DO THIS ON THE FRONT END.

02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:25.517
WELL MY UNDERSTANDING CENTER

02:05:25.584 --> 02:05:26.318
HERTZBERG IS THAT.

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:27.720
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME IDEAS

02:05:27.786 --> 02:05:29.622
ALREADY PROPOSED SENATE ROTH

02:05:29.688 --> 02:05:31.223
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG EVEN

02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:34.093
LAST YEAR OR RECENTLY ABOUT.

02:05:34.159 --> 02:05:36.061
SOME JOINT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

02:05:36.128 --> 02:05:37.630
DOING FRONT AND SCIENTIFIC

02:05:37.696 --> 02:05:38.764
REVIEW THAT.

02:05:38.831 --> 02:05:40.466
WE STILL DON'T HAVE A RESPONSE

02:05:40.532 --> 02:05:42.301
FROM THE OPPONENTS -- THE

02:05:42.368 --> 02:05:43.969
PROJECT PROPONENTS YET -- I I I

02:05:44.036 --> 02:05:45.604
KNOW THAT THERE'D BEEN SOME IDEA

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:46.105
LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:47.206
DIFFERENT.

02:05:47.273 --> 02:05:48.407
AGENCIES RIGHT NOW WE'RE TO

02:05:48.474 --> 02:05:52.912
FOCUS ON STATE LANDS COMMISSION

02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:54.546
IN THE PRESENT BILL.

02:05:54.613 --> 02:05:56.181
THERE'S THERE'S DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:57.716
D. W. ARE YOU AT ONE POINT HAD

02:05:57.783 --> 02:05:58.083
NO IDEA ABOUT.

02:05:58.150 --> 02:05:58.717
PUTTING THEM ALL TOGETHER ALONG

02:05:58.784 --> 02:05:59.485
WITH DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

02:05:59.551 --> 02:06:00.586
WILDLIFE WHO BY THE WAY IS THE

02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:03.489
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT STILL HAS.

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:05.991
SOME PURVIEW HERE -- HAVE YOU

02:06:06.058 --> 02:06:07.393
HAD A RESPONSE YET.

02:06:07.459 --> 02:06:08.961
FROM.

02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:11.697
SO I WOULD ASK THE MISTER SLATER

02:06:11.764 --> 02:06:14.233
DO YOU HAVE A A RESPONSE TO THIS

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.435
THIS CONCEPT OF DOING THE KIND

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:18.103
OF FRONT AND REVIEW THE AS YOU

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:20.239
SAID THE NOW ASSESSMENT THAT

02:06:20.306 --> 02:06:24.043
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- WITH D.

02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:27.146
W. R. -- AS WELL AS WHAT I HAD

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:28.447
HEARD WAS DEPARTMENT EFFICIENT

02:06:28.514 --> 02:06:29.949
WILDLIFE AND STATE LANDS

02:06:30.015 --> 02:06:31.483
COMMISSION SO CERTAIN SOME SORT

02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:32.584
OF JOINT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES

02:06:32.651 --> 02:06:34.887
THE NOW SAYS POINTS OUT.

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:35.521
THERE'S A CONFLICT AS TO WHO IS

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:37.923
A FAIR OBJECTIVE AN INDEPENDENT

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.792
ARBITER -- EVERYONE SORT OF HAS

02:06:39.858 --> 02:06:41.827
A VENUE PREFERENCE I UNDERSTAND

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:44.063
HERE BUT EVEN OPINION ON THAT

02:06:44.129 --> 02:06:48.334
SORT OF FRAMEWORK.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.469
PROPOSED I DO -- THE YOU YOU

02:06:50.536 --> 02:06:51.270
WOULD START WITH A SUBJECT

02:06:51.337 --> 02:06:52.204
MATTER GROUNDWATER BEING RIPOSTE

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:53.172
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:54.974
RESOURCES IT IS THE ENTITY WHICH

02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.342
IS ACTED AS A WATER MASTER

02:06:56.408 --> 02:06:58.043
GROUNDWATER CONTACTS IN

02:06:58.110 --> 02:07:00.779
CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES -- IT IS --

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:03.349
THE OVERSIGHT ENTITY FOR CIGNA

02:07:03.415 --> 02:07:04.683
IT UNDERSTANDS THE

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:05.584
INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:09.121
GROUNDWATER AND IN SERVICE WATER --

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:11.657
AND AND SO I WOULD SAY IT WOULD

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:14.626
BE THE NATURAL CONVENER FOR THE

02:07:14.693 --> 02:07:16.428
TITULAR HEAD OF WHATEVER INTO DE

02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:17.262
THERE WAS.

02:07:17.329 --> 02:07:18.897
MAN I THINK YOU COULD YOU COULD

02:07:18.964 --> 02:07:20.566
DO IT IN AS LONG AS IT'S OPEN

02:07:20.632 --> 02:07:21.867
AND TRANSPARENT AND I THINK

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:22.968
FOCUSED ON THE SUBJECT MATTER

02:07:23.035 --> 02:07:24.436
THAT THE SENATOR HAS.

02:07:24.503 --> 02:07:26.038
AND AND THE PROJECT OPPONENTS

02:07:26.105 --> 02:07:28.307
HAVE GREATEST FOCUS ON IS.

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:29.541
IS THE INTERCONNECTION IN THE

02:07:29.608 --> 02:07:31.310
SPRING IN THE HARM TO FISH AND

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:32.611
WILDLIFE AT THAT SPRING -- YOU

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:33.645
COULD EITHER HAVE DEAL YOU ARE

02:07:33.712 --> 02:07:35.447
HANDLED INDEPENDENTLY OR CONVENE

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:38.117
A PROCESS AND IT IS NOT UNLIKE

02:07:38.183 --> 02:07:40.119
OTHER TECHNICAL REVIEW PROCESS

02:07:40.185 --> 02:07:41.020
SEES WHERE.

02:07:41.086 --> 02:07:43.022
ALL SCIENTISTS WITH CREDENTIALS

02:07:43.088 --> 02:07:44.990
CAN COME AND PARTICIPATE AND THE

02:07:45.057 --> 02:07:46.792
ARBITER OF THE THE FINDER AND

02:07:46.859 --> 02:07:47.893
AND THE RECEIVER OF THAT

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.762
INFORMATION AND DECISION MAKER

02:07:49.828 --> 02:07:51.530
IS D. W. R. -- BUT IT'S NOT

02:07:51.597 --> 02:07:53.432
LIMITING IN WHO IT LISTENS TO IT

02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:54.700
LISTENS THE BEST AVAILABLE

02:07:54.767 --> 02:07:59.204
SCIENCE AND WHOEVER'S PRODUCING

02:07:59.271 --> 02:07:59.805
IT AND HOLD IT UP TO CRITICAL

02:07:59.872 --> 02:08:01.707
THOUGHT.

02:08:01.774 --> 02:08:02.374
SO.

02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:03.609
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THE JOINT

02:08:03.675 --> 02:08:05.210
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE I THINK

02:08:05.277 --> 02:08:06.145
THAT THE JOINT GOVERNANCE IS

02:08:06.211 --> 02:08:07.679
MORE CUMBERSOME THERE'S NOT A

02:08:07.746 --> 02:08:09.248
LOT OF EXPERIENCE AT THE STATE

02:08:09.314 --> 02:08:11.050
LANDS COMMISSION AT EVALUATING

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:13.685
GROUNDWATER ISSUES -- AND AND I

02:08:13.752 --> 02:08:14.987
THINK IF YOU ASSIGNED TO YOU

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:16.422
HAVE YOU ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:08:16.488 --> 02:08:17.990
THEY HAVE THE THEY SHOULD HAVE

02:08:18.057 --> 02:08:20.559
THE RIGHT. TO INTERVIEW ANYBODY

02:08:20.626 --> 02:08:22.428
THEY WANT TO TO GAIN THE BEST

02:08:22.494 --> 02:08:23.295
AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND

02:08:23.362 --> 02:08:24.229
INFORMATION WHICH HELPS THEM

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:25.631
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT

02:08:25.697 --> 02:08:26.865
NEEDS TO BE.

02:08:26.932 --> 02:08:28.033
GAINED SO I THINK BY LAW BY

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:30.302
POINTING TO HAVE YOU ARE YOU

02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:34.807
OPEN AND OPEN IT UP -- TATE TO A

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:36.275
PROCESS AND INPUT.

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:38.043
IT WOULD BE.

02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:39.545
COULD INCLUDE PROJECT OPPONENTS

02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:40.546
OCCUR IN IN IN IN IN INDEED IN

02:08:40.612 --> 02:08:41.280
FACT TO GET THE RESOLUTION WE

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:43.048
HOPE FOR WE WANT THEM TO COME

02:08:43.115 --> 02:08:44.183
FORWARD WITH THEIR SCIENTIFIC

02:08:44.249 --> 02:08:46.018
POSITION SO AGAIN IT CAN BE HELD

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:47.553
UP TO CRITICAL THOUGHT AND

02:08:47.619 --> 02:08:48.120
LIKEWISE.

DAVID KENNEDY PROVIDED HIS INPUT

02:13:18.757 --> 02:13:20.325
I RAISE THAT BECAUSE THIS

02:13:20.392 --> 02:13:22.060
PROVISION NEED TO BE RECONCILED

02:13:22.127 --> 02:13:23.662
WITH EIGHTEEN TEN DAY MATT MATT

02:13:23.729 --> 02:13:24.529
IS GOING TO MAKE ITS

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:26.264
DETERMINATIONS UNDER EIGHTEEN

02:13:26.331 --> 02:13:27.733
TEN D. LOOK AT ALL OF THE THE

02:13:27.799 --> 02:13:29.935
PROVISIONS THAT HOUSE TO LOOK AT

02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:30.435
THIS IS.

02:13:30.502 --> 02:13:32.137
A MORE FOCUSED ANALYSIS WHICH

02:13:32.204 --> 02:13:33.772
WOULD BE ADDITIVE AND IT WOULD

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:35.707
BE FOCUSED ON A COUNTY AND A

02:13:35.774 --> 02:13:37.008
SPECIFIC PROJECT.

02:13:37.075 --> 02:13:39.911
SOIN IN THIS INSTANCE THEN WE

APPLICABLES ONLY. TO THIS AREA.

02:13:48.787 --> 02:13:52.991
AND IN AND THINK THIS IS A

02:13:53.058 --> 02:13:53.558
PERFECTLY SUITABLE WAY TO GO

02:13:53.625 --> 02:13:55.761
ABOUT IT.

02:13:55.827 --> 02:13:57.429
THE OTHER MEMBERS OF A COMMONER

02:13:57.496 --> 02:14:00.499

BEEN A LOT OF HISTORY TO THIS

02:14:04.803 --> 02:14:06.471
AND AND I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO IT

02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:08.707
I HAVE A LOCAL.

02:14:08.774 --> 02:14:10.442
A WONDERFUL COMPANY THAT.

02:14:10.509 --> 02:14:11.476
DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THIS BILL

02:14:11.543 --> 02:14:13.178
PASSED SO I'M PARTICULARLY

02:14:13.245 --> 02:14:15.347
SENSITIVE TO THIS ISSUE BUT IT

02:14:15.414 --> 02:14:17.149
SEEMS TO ME AND I HAVE THE

02:14:17.215 --> 02:14:18.583
HIGHEST REGARD.

02:14:20.552 --> 02:14:22.954
HOMEWORK LIKE NOBODY I KNOW.

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:25.557
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS REALLY

02:14:25.624 --> 02:14:28.360
WHAT HE'S ASKING FORCES UP FRONT.

02:14:28.427 --> 02:14:29.694
EFFORT.

02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:31.530
AND AND SO I I WANT TO SIMPLIFY

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:33.999
THIS CONSENT MY QUESTION WAS A

02:14:34.065 --> 02:14:35.534
GENUINE.

02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:36.802
ONE REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU

02:14:36.868 --> 02:14:39.471
ULTIMATELY DECIDE WHAT THAT UP

02:14:39.538 --> 02:14:41.039
FRONT APPROACH WOULD BE.

02:14:41.106 --> 02:14:44.376
ARE YOU WILLING TO CONSIDER.

02:14:44.443 --> 02:14:46.511

TABLE IS SET YOU KNOW SOMETIMES.

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:55.821
IT'S IT'S EASIER TO ASK

02:14:55.887 --> 02:14:57.956
FORGIVENESS THAN PERMISSION AND

02:14:58.023 --> 02:15:00.325
MIKE MY QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER

02:15:00.392 --> 02:15:02.861

PARTICULAR SPRING.

02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:21.046

FROM NOW FOR MORE FIRMLY THE

02:16:04.723 --> 02:16:06.224
OPINION THAT REASONABLE MINDS

02:16:06.291 --> 02:16:09.828
CAN CERTAINLY PREVAIL EVEN IN

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:11.863
COMPLICATED SITUATIONS.

02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:12.898
JUST SO I'M.

02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:13.665
CLEAR A JOT DOWN A COUPLE OF

02:16:13.732 --> 02:16:14.032
NOTES ON WHAT.

02:16:14.099 --> 02:16:17.202
WOULD BE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

02:16:17.269 --> 02:16:19.938
DECEIVES THE MAKER OF THE ITEM

02:16:20.005 --> 02:16:21.339
WOULD BE WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD.

02:16:21.406 --> 02:16:23.074
BASED ON WHAT CENTER JACKSON HAD

02:16:23.141 --> 02:16:24.676
SAID IN YOUR AGREEMENT --

02:16:24.743 --> 02:16:26.344
RESPONSE.

02:16:26.411 --> 02:16:29.214
IS THAT THERE WOULD BE A THAT D.

02:16:29.281 --> 02:16:30.815
W. R..

02:16:30.882 --> 02:16:32.284
WOULD YOU SERVE AS LEAD AGENCY

02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:35.854
TO CONVENE AN UP FRONT.

02:16:35.921 --> 02:16:37.556
OUR STUDY.

02:16:37.622 --> 02:16:38.924
OF THIS PROJECT.

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:41.593
AND IT'S SUSTAINABILITY.

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:43.628
THE D. W. R. WOULD SIT AS A

02:16:43.695 --> 02:16:46.264
TRUSTEE -- ON THE BOARD.

02:16:46.331 --> 02:16:47.999
MOVING FORWARD.

02:16:48.066 --> 02:16:49.000
AND THAT THERE WOULD BE AN

02:16:49.067 --> 02:16:51.736
ANNUAL OR AS NEEDED TO REVIEW TO

02:16:51.803 --> 02:16:54.072
MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS NO

02:16:54.139 --> 02:16:57.742
DEPLETION -- THAT IS UNFORESEEN.

02:16:57.809 --> 02:16:59.978
BUT THAT THAT STUDY BY D. W. R.

02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:04.015
IS LIMITED TO THE SPRINGS.

02:17:04.082 --> 02:17:06.117
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER MR

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:07.052
OFF ITS.

02:17:07.118 --> 02:17:08.386
SENATOR THE PROBLEM WITH

02:17:08.453 --> 02:17:10.455
NEGOTIATING AMENDMENTS FROM THE

02:17:10.522 --> 02:17:11.256
NOW IS IT'S TOUGH.

02:17:11.323 --> 02:17:12.824
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LANGUAGE

02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:14.726
REALLY LOOKS LIKE AND THEIR

02:17:14.793 --> 02:17:15.760
IMPLICATIONS LOCATIONS.

02:17:15.827 --> 02:17:17.062
I DISAGREE WITH WHAT MISTER

02:17:17.128 --> 02:17:18.263
SLATER SAID WITH THE DIP WITH

02:17:18.330 --> 02:17:19.664
RESPECT TO THE DISCHARGE AND

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:21.366
RECHARGE RATES THE DISCHARGING

02:17:21.433 --> 02:17:23.068
RESEARCH JUST CHARGE AND

02:17:23.134 --> 02:17:25.537
RECHARGE RATES DIRECTLY IMPACT

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:26.838
THE SPRINGS IF YOU'RE PULLING

02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:29.107
MORE WATER OUT OF THE AQUIFER.

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:30.675
THEN YOU'RE PUTTING BACK IN

02:17:30.742 --> 02:17:32.811
DEPENDING ON HOW THE SCIENCE

02:17:32.877 --> 02:17:33.545
RESOLVES THIS.

02:17:33.612 --> 02:17:35.513
IF THE SPRINGS ARE CONNECTED

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:38.250
BOTH BONANZA AND ANY OTHER THERE

02:17:38.316 --> 02:17:38.717
FOR FIVE OTHER SPRINGS

02:17:38.783 --> 02:17:40.518
ASSOCIATED OUT THERE IN THE

02:17:40.585 --> 02:17:42.053
WATER LEVEL IN THE SPRINGS IS

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:44.589
DEPLETED WHICH IMPACTS BIGHORN

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:46.458
SHEEP VEGETATION THIS SAID THE

02:17:46.524 --> 02:17:48.893
OTHER SO IT'S ALL INTERCONNECTED.

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:51.596
AND IT IS A IT IS A TOP TO

02:17:51.663 --> 02:17:53.465
BOTTOM REVIEW AND RECONCILIATION

02:17:53.531 --> 02:17:54.899
OF THE SCIENCE.

02:17:54.966 --> 02:17:56.801
I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO HAVE A

02:17:56.868 --> 02:17:58.136
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHO DOES IT

02:17:58.203 --> 02:17:59.904
I'M MORE PERSONALLY AGNOSTIC ON

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:00.972
THE POINT.

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:02.807
BUT I'VE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

02:18:02.874 --> 02:18:06.011
BECAUSE UNTIL THIS MORNING.

02:18:06.077 --> 02:18:08.546
WE HAVE NOT HAD A CONVERSATION

02:18:08.613 --> 02:18:11.182
ABOUT FRONT END REVIEW EVER.

02:18:11.249 --> 02:18:13.451
WITH KIDDIES SO I'M PERFECTLY

02:18:13.518 --> 02:18:15.253
WILLING IF THIS BILL SHOULD

02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:16.988
HAPPEN TO MOVE OUT OF THIS

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:18.857
COMMITTEE AND I HAVE NO IDEA. TO

02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:19.858
CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT

02:18:19.924 --> 02:18:22.861
CONVERSATION AND TO WORK TO A A

02:18:22.927 --> 02:18:24.462
COMPROMISE SOLUTION THAT MISTER

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:26.231
SLATER AND HIS COMPANY HAVE

02:18:26.297 --> 02:18:26.998
CONFIDENCE.

02:18:27.065 --> 02:18:28.566
IT ACCOMPLISHES MY SOLE

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:30.368
OBJECTIVE HERE WHICH IS TO

02:18:30.435 --> 02:18:32.404
RESOLVE RECONCILE THE SCIENCE

02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:34.105
AND SENATE ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:18:34.172 --> 02:18:36.675
SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RIGHT UP I

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:38.476
PLEDGE THAT TO YOU [inaudible]

02:18:38.543 --> 02:18:40.045
ALL RIGHT.

02:18:40.111 --> 02:18:40.979
SO THERE'S A MOTION I DON'T

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:42.313
THINK WE'RE GOING TO RESOLVE

02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:44.115
DECADES OF CONFLICT HERE FROM

02:18:44.182 --> 02:18:45.684
THE DIS TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO

02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:47.585
NOTE THAT I THINK SOME PROGRESS

02:18:47.652 --> 02:18:49.187
HAS BEEN MADE.

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:50.955
SOME POSITIONS HAVE BEEN HAVE

02:18:51.022 --> 02:18:52.490
EVOLVED.

02:18:52.557 --> 02:18:54.159
I TRUST IN THE SENATOR IN THE

02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:59.030
AUTHOR FOR ALL HIS DILIGENCE. TO

02:18:59.097 --> 02:18:59.464
TO TO TAKE THIS INTO

02:18:59.531 --> 02:19:01.599
CONSIDERATION -- WE DO HAVE A

02:19:01.666 --> 02:19:04.135
MOTION AT TO TO A MEN AT TWO MEN

02:19:04.202 --> 02:19:06.337
THEN MOVED TO APPROPRIATIONS BUT

02:19:06.404 --> 02:19:09.207
YOU KNOW THE THE RECORD

02:19:09.274 --> 02:19:11.476
ESTABLISHED IN THIS HEARING THEN

02:19:11.543 --> 02:19:13.311
THE WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT SOME

02:19:13.378 --> 02:19:15.847
OTHER KIND OF FRONT AND REVIEW --

02:19:15.914 --> 02:19:17.549
PRIOR TO PROJECT INITIATION I

02:19:17.615 --> 02:19:18.616
THINK IS.

02:19:18.683 --> 02:19:20.852
NOT WORTHY AND WORTHY OF

02:19:20.919 --> 02:19:22.487
CONSIDERATION.

02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:24.189
SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU.

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:25.790
YOU IN THE PROPONENTS CONSIDER

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:27.125
THAT GOING FORWARD.

02:19:27.192 --> 02:19:30.395
AND WORK WITH US IN THE-COMMITTEE -- SHOULD THIS BILL

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:32.964
MOVE FORWARD I'LL BE SUPPORTING

02:19:33.031 --> 02:19:34.666
THE MEASURE TODAY.

02:19:34.733 --> 02:19:36.868
AND IGN NOW JING THAT YOU'VE

02:19:36.935 --> 02:19:38.570
BEEN WORKING IN GOOD FAITH THIS

02:19:38.636 --> 02:19:40.305
WHOLE TIME AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN

02:19:40.371 --> 02:19:42.173
A HEADACHE.

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:45.477
BUT ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE.

02:19:45.543 --> 02:19:47.479
CENTERS FOR DO YOU WANT TO JUMP

02:19:47.545 --> 02:19:49.748
IN WITH ONE LAST A PIECE OF

02:19:49.814 --> 02:19:52.117
WISDOM YES SIR I JUST THINK

02:19:52.183 --> 02:19:53.618
MISTER MAYES WANNA MAKE SURE.

02:19:53.685 --> 02:19:55.353
I WAS SUPPORTED BUT I I I JUST

02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:56.821
CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH.

02:19:56.888 --> 02:19:58.857
THAT I THINK THAT THE TWO ISSUES

02:19:58.923 --> 02:20:00.959
I REYES NEED TO BE RESOLVED AT

02:20:01.025 --> 02:20:02.427
LEAST AS RELATES FROM MY OWN

02:20:02.494 --> 02:20:03.828
VOTING ON THIS THING GOING

02:20:03.895 --> 02:20:05.263
FORWARD IS.

02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:06.431
ONE FIGURING OUT A TIME LINES

02:20:06.498 --> 02:20:08.066
THAT IT'S FAIR PROCESS WHATEVER

02:20:08.133 --> 02:20:09.434
THAT IS I I DON'T KNOW THAT IS

02:20:09.501 --> 02:20:10.535
I'M NOT AN EXPERT.

02:20:10.602 --> 02:20:11.569
BUT I THINK IT'S A FAIR

02:20:11.636 --> 02:20:13.438
OBSERVATION IT SHOULD BE A TIME

02:20:13.505 --> 02:20:15.974
LINE FOR THIS THIS ANALYSIS TO

02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:17.575
BE DONE EXPERTS WILL HAVE TO

02:20:17.642 --> 02:20:18.777
MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND I

02:20:18.843 --> 02:20:20.078
ASK THAT YOU.

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:21.546
WORK ON THAT AND SECONDLY YOU

02:20:21.613 --> 02:20:24.315
KNOW THE ISSUE OF WHO THE THAT

02:20:24.382 --> 02:20:26.384
THE JURY IS IF YOU WILL BECOMES

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:27.952
VERY IMPORTANT A JUDGE AND JURY

02:20:28.019 --> 02:20:29.521
BECOME VERY IMPORTANT AGAIN WHAT

02:20:29.587 --> 02:20:31.289
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO ANSWER

02:20:31.356 --> 02:20:32.590
A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION.

02:20:32.657 --> 02:20:34.392
IN A MANNER THAT'S FAIR AND

02:20:34.459 --> 02:20:36.728
PROVIDES CONFIDENCE TO TO OUR

CANALS A STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE

02:33:19.924 --> 02:33:20.491
BECAUSE IT IT'S IS VERY

02:33:20.558 --> 02:33:21.325
DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF THE OTHER

02:33:21.392 --> 02:33:22.860
FACILITIES BECAUSE IT WAS

02:33:22.927 --> 02:33:24.028
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT

02:33:24.094 --> 02:33:25.396

02:33:30.334 --> 02:33:33.771
SUCCESSFULLY.

02:33:33.837 --> 02:33:35.072
THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THAT MARKS

02:33:35.139 --> 02:33:36.941
THE SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY THE

02:33:37.007 --> 02:33:38.342
FRANK KERN CAN NOW SO WE HAVE A

02:33:38.409 --> 02:33:40.444
PRETTY LARGE AGING

02:33:40.511 --> 02:33:41.679
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE GOING ON

02:33:41.745 --> 02:33:43.347
WHERE THE CANAL IS LOST SOME OF

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:45.382
ITS CONVEYANCE CAPACITY DUE TO

02:33:45.449 --> 02:33:46.283
SUBSIDENCE.

02:33:46.350 --> 02:33:49.086
WHEN THE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN

02:33:49.153 --> 02:33:50.120
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DROUGHT

02:33:50.187 --> 02:33:51.221
THERE IS A SEVERE CONSTRUCTION

02:33:51.288 --> 02:33:52.590
ON THE LOWER TWO THIRDS OF THE

02:33:52.656 --> 02:33:54.491
FRANK KERN CANAL NEAR THE TOWN

02:33:54.558 --> 02:33:57.328
OF PORTER BILL DID OVER PUMPING

02:33:57.394 --> 02:33:59.930
OF THE GROUNDWATER -- THAT HIS

02:33:59.997 --> 02:34:01.098
THAT IS BECAUSE THIS PAGE POINT

02:34:01.165 --> 02:34:01.966
TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE

02:34:02.032 --> 02:34:04.168
CANALS CONVEYANCE CAPACITY. TO

02:34:04.234 --> 02:34:08.138
JUST ABOVE 40% OF ITS DESIGN MAX.

02:34:08.205 --> 02:34:08.973
THIS REDUCTION MEANS THAT IN

02:34:09.039 --> 02:34:11.008
WHAT YEARS LIKE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:34:11.075 --> 02:34:11.542
AND THE YEAR THAT WE'RE

02:34:11.609 --> 02:34:12.643
EXPERIENCING THIS YEAR AS MUCH

02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:14.645
AS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE

02:34:14.712 --> 02:34:15.312
FEET OF WATER.

02:34:15.379 --> 02:34:17.748
AS NOT ABLE TO BE SUPPLIED --

02:34:17.815 --> 02:34:20.317
DOWN THE CANAL AND PUT IN THE

02:34:20.384 --> 02:34:20.684
GROUND.

02:34:20.751 --> 02:34:22.086
IN TERMS OF A DOLLAR VALUE THAT

02:34:22.152 --> 02:34:23.854
WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT

02:34:23.921 --> 02:34:25.255
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

02:34:25.322 --> 02:34:26.523
MILLION DOLLARS AVERAGE ANNUAL.

02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:28.492
AND THE VALUE OF THE CANAL

02:34:28.559 --> 02:34:30.160
HOWEVER IS IS MUCH GREATER THAN

02:34:30.227 --> 02:34:32.363
THAT BECAUSE WITHOUT PUTTING

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:33.964
WATER IN A YEAR THAT'S A LARGE

02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:35.666
YEAR WE DON'T HAVE WATER IN

02:34:35.733 --> 02:34:36.400
DROUGHT YEARS.

02:34:36.467 --> 02:34:38.302
SO THERE'S NO CARRY OVER TO BE

02:34:38.369 --> 02:34:40.037
ABLE TO TO GO INTO FOR DRYER

02:34:40.104 --> 02:34:40.371
YEARS.

02:34:40.437 --> 02:34:41.705
WHEN WE DISCOVERED THIS PROBLEM

02:34:41.772 --> 02:34:44.141
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FRONT

02:34:44.208 --> 02:34:44.775
WATER AUTHORITY IMMEDIATELY GOT

02:34:44.842 --> 02:34:45.509
ON IT?

02:34:45.576 --> 02:34:49.346
GOT MOVING AND AND SCOPE THE

02:34:49.413 --> 02:34:50.080
PROBLEM THERE.

02:34:50.147 --> 02:34:51.248
TOO NARROWED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

02:34:51.315 --> 02:34:52.983
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW

02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:55.653
ONE IS -- A RAISING OF THE BANKS

02:34:55.719 --> 02:34:57.221
ON THE ON THE FRANK KERN CANAL

02:34:57.287 --> 02:34:58.656
AND THE OTHER IS -- A PARALLEL

02:34:58.722 --> 02:35:00.157
REALIGNMENT OF THE FRANK KERN

02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:37.694
THIS IS NOT A HEAVY BURDEN AND

02:40:37.761 --> 02:40:38.462

02:46:16.599 --> 02:46:18.335
ABOUT FOR DECADES.

02:46:18.401 --> 02:46:20.003
AND THIS IS A PROJECT THAT

02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:21.404
BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER.

02:46:21.471 --> 02:46:24.607
IT DOES SO ON THE MERITS.

02:46:24.674 --> 02:46:26.643
AND I AM CERTAINLY PROUD TO

02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:28.812
SUPPORT THIS -- AND I I WOULD

02:46:28.878 --> 02:46:31.414
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES

02:46:31.481 --> 02:46:32.916
TO TO DO THE SAME.

02:46:32.982 --> 02:46:34.751
IF THERE IS FEDERAL FUNDING AND

02:46:34.818 --> 02:46:36.986
I'M HOPEFUL THAT -- OF SOME OF

02:46:37.053 --> 02:46:39.022
THE WISER VOICES IN WASHINGTON

02:46:39.089 --> 02:46:41.858
IT WOULD AGREE -- THAT THIS

02:46:41.925 --> 02:46:44.594
MERITS -- FEDERAL ALLOCATION AS

02:46:44.661 --> 02:46:47.297
WELL -- THAT WOULD HELP WITH THE

02:46:47.364 --> 02:46:48.365
THE COSTS.

02:46:48.431 --> 02:46:51.267
AND IF THE COSTS GO DOWN --

02:46:51.334 --> 02:46:53.803
DEPENDING ON THE OVERALL --

02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:55.372
PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT.

02:46:55.438 --> 02:46:57.674
OF A OF INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES

02:46:57.741 --> 02:46:59.776
THEN I IMAGINE THE BUDGET WILL

02:46:59.843 --> 02:47:01.544
REFLECT THAT ACCORDINGLY -- BUT

02:47:01.611 --> 02:47:02.946
I THINK THIS IS JUST ONE OF

02:47:03.012 --> 02:47:04.247
THOSE MOMENTS WHERE I'M JUST

02:47:04.314 --> 02:47:05.749
PROUD TO BE A PART.

02:47:05.815 --> 02:47:08.518
OF HELPING THE VALLEY HELPING --

02:47:08.585 --> 02:47:10.019
UNDERPERFORMING IN

02:47:10.086 --> 02:47:11.755
DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES I

02:47:11.821 --> 02:47:13.123
HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING

02:47:13.189 --> 02:47:14.657

IS A BIG PROBLEM.

02:47:39.983 --> 02:47:40.784
A RUNS ALONG KIND OF THE

02:47:40.850 --> 02:47:41.451
BACKBONE OF OUR STATE THAT MAKES

02:47:41.518 --> 02:47:43.753
OF THE CONVEYANCE OF WATER MUCH

02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:44.954
MORE COMPLICATED.

02:47:45.021 --> 02:47:46.756
AND MUCH MORE COSTLY THIS IS A

02:47:46.823 --> 02:47:50.827
BIG PROBLEM -- I'VE BEEN DEALING

02:47:50.894 --> 02:47:52.662
WITH A SIMILAR MATTER WHERE THE

02:47:52.729 --> 02:47:54.197
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A

02:47:54.264 --> 02:47:55.532
RESPONSIBILITY.

02:47:55.598 --> 02:47:57.333

AND THE THE STATE HAS TAKEN THE

02:48:08.745 --> 02:48:10.647
THE THE BIGGEST ROLE IN TRYING

02:48:10.713 --> 02:48:12.348
TO FUND THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND

02:48:12.415 --> 02:48:14.117
REALLY WE HAVE ALSO.

02:48:14.184 --> 02:48:16.019
PUT UP A FEW HUNDRED MILLION. TO

02:48:16.085 --> 02:48:17.454
A MASSIVE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR

02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:19.856
PROJECT THIS IS A MUCH SMALLER

02:48:19.923 --> 02:48:20.156
[inaudible]

02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:22.225
ONE IMPORTANT.

02:48:22.292 --> 02:48:24.294
BUT AGAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:25.395
HERE COMPLETELY.

02:48:25.462 --> 02:48:26.763
WALKING AWAY FROM THEIR

02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:28.331
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH OUR

02:48:28.398 --> 02:48:30.033
FORESTS WITH OUR WATER WAYS

02:48:30.099 --> 02:48:31.935
EVERYTHING ELSE BUT A WALL.

02:48:32.001 --> 02:48:33.303
THEY WANT TO BUILD A WALL AND

02:48:33.369 --> 02:48:35.438
THEY WANT TO BUILD A FIVE POINT

02:48:35.505 --> 02:48:36.906
SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR WALL THAT

02:48:36.973 --> 02:48:39.576
WILL ACTUALLY TO ABSOLUTELY.

02:48:39.642 --> 02:48:42.345
NOTHING ZERO THAT'S JUST SEEMS

02:48:42.412 --> 02:48:43.112
TO BE THE PRIORITY WHILE

02:48:43.179 --> 02:48:45.248
EVERYTHING ELSE IS FALLING APART

02:48:45.315 --> 02:48:46.449
SALTON SEA NEW RIVER TIJUANA

02:48:46.516 --> 02:48:47.851

02:48:47.917 --> 02:48:49.719
FRANK CANAL.

02:48:49.786 --> 02:48:51.921
THEY WANT TO BUILD A WALL.

02:48:51.988 --> 02:48:53.957
THERE WAS A HE APPOINTED -- A

02:48:54.023 --> 02:48:57.160
WATER CZAR.

02:48:57.227 --> 02:48:58.528
TRUMP DID TO LOOK OVER ALL THE

02:48:58.595 --> 02:48:59.329
WATER WAYS IN THE COUNTRY AND

02:48:59.395 --> 02:49:01.564
THERE ARE SIMILAR PROBLEMS LIKE

02:49:01.631 --> 02:49:03.666
THIS RECROSS COUNTRY.

02:49:03.733 --> 02:49:04.934
DEALING WITH THE MISSISSIPPI IN

02:49:05.001 --> 02:49:06.135
THE HALL AT A HIGHER RIVER AND

02:49:06.202 --> 02:49:08.104
IT'S IT DEALS WITH THE ABILITY

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:09.706
TO MOVE GOODS FROM IMPORTANT

02:49:09.772 --> 02:49:11.508
PARTS OUR STATE INTERNATIONALLY

02:49:11.574 --> 02:49:12.976
AND THIS PRESIDENT BASICALLY

02:49:13.042 --> 02:49:13.910
MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE

02:49:13.977 --> 02:49:14.711
WILL.

02:49:14.777 --> 02:49:16.913
NOT BE ADDRESSING THE STATION

02:49:16.980 --> 02:49:18.848
THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.

02:49:18.915 --> 02:49:20.049
SO THAT'S WHAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:49:20.116 --> 02:49:22.352
DEALING WITH.

02:49:22.418 --> 02:49:22.986
BUT THEY WILL BE WILL BUILDING A

02:49:23.052 --> 02:49:23.987
WALL.

02:49:24.053 --> 02:49:26.222
N. AND MY MESSAGE IS NOT ONLY TO

02:49:26.289 --> 02:49:27.924
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BUT THE

02:49:27.991 --> 02:49:29.559
CALIFORNIANS AND THEN

02:49:29.626 --> 02:49:33.897
CALIFORNIANS OF OF TRUMP'S PARTY.

02:49:33.963 --> 02:49:36.699
THAT CONTINUE TO URGE.

02:49:36.766 --> 02:49:38.902
THE PRESIDENT TO BUILD A WALL

02:49:38.968 --> 02:49:40.103
AND SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT TO

02:49:40.169 --> 02:49:41.704
BUILD BUILD A WALL THAT WILL DO

02:49:41.771 --> 02:49:43.439
NOTHING TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF

02:49:43.506 --> 02:49:45.174
THEIR COMMUNITY.

02:49:45.241 --> 02:49:46.743
BUT IT WILL HURT.

02:49:46.809 --> 02:49:48.745
PROJECTS LIKE THIS THAT WOULD

02:49:48.811 --> 02:49:50.446
THEY REFUSE TO FUND THAT NEED TO

02:49:50.513 --> 02:49:51.848
FUND THAT ARE 100% IN THEIR

02:49:51.915 --> 02:49:53.316
JURISDICTION.

02:49:53.383 --> 02:49:55.018
JUST BECAUSE IT'S A 100% THEIR

02:49:55.084 --> 02:49:56.185
JURISDICTION I DON'T THINK THE

02:49:56.252 --> 02:49:57.620
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD WALK

02:49:57.687 --> 02:49:59.055
AWAY AND SAY WE'RE NOT GOING

02:49:59.122 --> 02:50:00.957
BEFORE THE SOLUTIONS WHEN WHEN A

02:50:01.024 --> 02:50:02.625
SPORT WILL TODAY.

02:50:02.692 --> 02:50:03.259

02:50:03.326 --> 02:50:04.227
CONSISTENT AND LET'S GET OUR

02:50:04.294 --> 02:50:05.361
PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.

02:50:11.734 --> 02:50:14.304
GOOD FISCAL SOLUTIONS THIS IS.

02:50:14.370 --> 02:50:15.438
ONE THAT DESERVES ATTENTION OF

02:50:15.505 --> 02:50:17.840
OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:50:17.907 --> 02:50:19.409

UNIQUE ASK OR DO WE DO THIS ON

02:52:30.907 --> 02:52:37.046
OCCASION -- FOR VARIOUS REASONS.

IF I MAY.

02:52:38.648 --> 02:52:39.148
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO

02:52:39.215 --> 02:52:39.716
PRECEDENT FOR THIS TYPE OF

02:52:39.782 --> 02:52:40.917
ACTION AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE

02:52:40.983 --> 02:52:41.651
PROBLEMS THAT WE USED.

02:52:41.718 --> 02:52:43.252
TO A CAMPAIGN AGAINST PROP THREE

02:52:43.319 --> 02:52:45.555
OF THAT THAT WAS A OBVIOUSLY

02:52:45.621 --> 02:52:47.390
SEVEN AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR.

02:52:47.457 --> 02:52:48.725
ALLOCATION FRANK KERN THAT WE

02:52:48.791 --> 02:52:50.359
THOUGHT WAS -- FOR PRESIDENTIAL --

02:52:50.426 --> 02:52:52.495
AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS

THEY PUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:46.976
BOARD -- I THINK THAT.

02:54:47.043 --> 02:54:48.978
IS THE END OF MY TERM.

02:54:49.045 --> 02:54:51.013
QUESTION YOU ARE A LAST QUESTION --

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:51.781
WHAT?

02:54:51.848 --> 02:54:53.716
IF IF WE HAD A FEDERAL

02:54:53.783 --> 02:54:55.218
GOVERNMENT THERE WAS --

02:54:55.284 --> 02:54:58.254
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS -- TO

02:54:58.321 --> 02:54:59.922
REPAIR AND MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE

02:54:59.989 --> 02:55:01.624
ITS INFRASTRUCTURE THE

02:55:01.691 --> 02:55:03.259
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IT HAS.

02:55:03.326 --> 02:55:04.527
RESPONSIBILITY.

02:55:16.105 --> 02:55:17.473
STATE.

02:55:17.540 --> 02:55:18.307
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS

02:55:18.374 --> 02:55:20.076
FUNDS NEED TO BE APPROPRIATED

02:55:20.142 --> 02:55:21.444
THROUGH CONGRESS BUT THEY BUT

02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:23.179

02:55:28.451 --> 02:55:30.586
AND NATURE AGAIN SIMILAR SIMILAR

02:55:30.653 --> 02:55:34.590
TO YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER -- THE

02:55:34.657 --> 02:55:35.157
SIZE OF THIS PROJECT IS VERY

02:55:35.224 --> 02:55:36.225
LARGE.

02:55:36.292 --> 02:55:37.627
OKAY.

THE PRECEDENT IT SETS BUT I

02:55:41.998 --> 02:55:43.399
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A

02:55:43.466 --> 02:55:46.102
DESPERATE NEED AND I I WOULD IT

02:55:46.168 --> 02:55:46.936

THINK -- WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:55:53.876 --> 02:55:55.111
FRONT WATER THIRTY STATE EARLIER

02:55:55.177 --> 02:55:56.879
THIS HAS BEEN LOCALLY FUNDED

02:55:56.946 --> 02:55:58.147
LOCALLY OPERATED LOCALLY

02:55:58.214 --> 02:55:59.215
MAINTAINED?

02:55:59.282 --> 02:56:02.818
BY FRONT WATER AUTHORITY USERS

02:56:02.885 --> 02:56:04.787
BY THE LEADERS AND BY THE

02:56:04.854 --> 02:56:05.388
FARMERS IN THOSE AREAS SINCE

02:56:05.454 --> 02:56:07.256
ABOUT -- NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT

02:56:07.323 --> 02:56:08.524
UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGACY ISSUE

02:56:08.591 --> 02:56:09.825
SUBSIDENCE AS A RESULT OF STATE

02:56:09.892 --> 02:56:12.094
AN ACTION THAT THE ISSUE OF

02:56:12.161 --> 02:56:13.262
SUBSIDENCE AS A RESULT OF A

02:56:13.329 --> 02:56:15.097
PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

02:56:15.164 --> 02:56:16.232
THERE WAS NO SUSTAINABLE GROUND

02:56:16.299 --> 02:56:17.600
WATER MANAGEMENT ACT.

02:56:17.667 --> 02:56:19.869
AND SO THAT THE LACK OF PUBLIC

02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:20.636
POLICY THAT PUBLIC POLICY

02:56:20.703 --> 02:56:22.571
FAILURE HAS EFFECTIVELY

02:56:22.638 --> 02:56:23.773
UNDERMINED THE ABILITY.

02:56:23.839 --> 02:56:25.241
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LOCALLY

MAINTENANCE OF THIS AREA -- TO

02:56:30.947 --> 02:56:31.414
TO SEE A RETURN ON THEIR

02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:33.716
INVESTMENT AND SO IT'S AT LEAST

02:56:33.783 --> 02:56:34.917
THE THE OPINION THE EASTERN TO

02:56:34.984 --> 02:56:36.052
THE GSA THAT THE STATE SHOULD

HAVE BEEN LEFT TO ROT ALONGSIDE

03:09:16.678 --> 03:09:17.245
THE OREGON HIGHWAY PREVIOUSLY.

03:09:17.312 --> 03:09:18.847
ONE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF

03:09:18.914 --> 03:09:21.316
WHAT WE DID IN OREGON WAS.

03:09:21.383 --> 03:09:22.684
WE DIDN'T REINVENT THE WHEEL.

03:09:22.751 --> 03:09:24.219
AS WE BEGIN OUR RESEARCH WE

03:09:24.286 --> 03:09:25.921
DISCOVERED TWENTY STATES ALREADY

03:09:25.987 --> 03:09:28.156
HAD PASS ROAD KILL BILLS.

03:09:28.223 --> 03:09:30.092
THEY SPAN THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM

03:09:30.158 --> 03:09:32.160
FROM LIBERAL VERMONT. TO

03:09:32.227 --> 03:09:33.428
CONSERVATIVE WYOMING.

03:09:33.495 --> 03:09:35.697
IN CRAFTING SENATE BILL THREE

03:09:35.764 --> 03:09:36.531
SEVENTY TWO WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK

03:09:36.598 --> 03:09:38.200
AT OUR THREE NORTHWEST NEIGHBORS

03:09:38.266 --> 03:09:40.902
WASHINGTON IDAHO AND MONTANA.

03:09:40.969 --> 03:09:42.871
WITHOUT APOLOGY WE INCORPORATED

03:09:42.938 --> 03:09:44.840
MUCH OF WHAT THE STATE'S ALREADY

03:09:44.906 --> 03:09:45.974
HAD ON THE BOOKS.

03:09:46.041 --> 03:09:48.477
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT SENATE BILL

03:09:48.543 --> 03:09:49.077
THREE SEVENTY TWO YOU ARE IN

03:09:49.144 --> 03:09:50.212

WESTERN STATES HAVE FOUND

03:09:52.581 --> 03:09:53.348
SUCCESSFUL.

03:09:53.415 --> 03:09:55.684

AND IN THAT -- CAPACITY WE

03:10:48.970 --> 03:10:49.838
ENGAGE.

03:10:49.905 --> 03:10:51.873
ROAD ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH RIGHT

03:10:51.940 --> 03:10:53.742
CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD --

03:10:53.809 --> 03:10:55.544
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A ROAD KILL

03:10:55.610 --> 03:10:57.946
MONITORING SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA

03:10:58.013 --> 03:10:59.948
IT'S IN ITS TENTH YEAR AND WE

03:11:00.015 --> 03:11:01.383
ARE THE MAJOR SUPPLIER OF THAT

03:11:01.449 --> 03:11:03.218
KIND OF DATA TO CALTRANS

03:11:03.285 --> 03:11:06.087
DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE AND

03:11:06.154 --> 03:11:07.556
OTHER CLIENTS -- SO THERE'S

03:11:07.622 --> 03:11:09.191
ALREADY AN APP THERE THAT WE

03:11:09.257 --> 03:11:09.958
COULD USE FOR THIS KIND OF

03:11:10.025 --> 03:11:12.460
REPORTING -- JUST TO KEEP US ALL

03:11:12.527 --> 03:11:14.462
ON THE SAME PAGE THE STATISTICS

03:11:14.529 --> 03:11:16.164
THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER AT

03:11:16.231 --> 03:11:17.566
LEAST TWENTY THOUSAND DEER

03:11:17.632 --> 03:11:19.301
KILLED HERE ON CALIFORNIA

03:11:19.367 --> 03:11:20.969
ROADWAYS THAT'S BASED ONLY ON

03:11:21.036 --> 03:11:24.172
CLAIMS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES.

03:11:24.239 --> 03:11:25.674
FOR THOSE WHO CAN THINK THAT

03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:27.075
WENT THROUGH THERE A LOT OF DEER

03:11:27.142 --> 03:11:28.109
THAT ALSO HAD THAT AREN'T

03:11:28.176 --> 03:11:29.978
THERE'S NO CLAIM ASSOCIATED AND

03:11:30.045 --> 03:11:31.713
IN OTHER STATES THAT CAN BE UP

03:11:31.780 --> 03:11:33.014
TO FOUR TIMES AS MANY.

03:11:33.081 --> 03:11:34.216
DEER OR LARGE ANIMALS ARE HIT

03:11:34.282 --> 03:11:35.951
THAT ARE ACTUALLY REPORTED WHICH

03:11:36.017 --> 03:11:37.385
MEANS THAT TWENTY THOUSAND IS

03:11:37.452 --> 03:11:39.588
OUR BASE LINE AND WE CAN GO UP

03:11:39.654 --> 03:11:40.956
TO EIGHTY THOUSAND POSSIBLE.

03:11:41.022 --> 03:11:42.557
THAT IS NOT PART OF ANY STATE

03:11:42.624 --> 03:11:45.093
MODELING OF DEER POPULATIONS AND

03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:46.494
COULD BE PART OF THE REASON WHY

03:11:46.561 --> 03:11:47.829
IN A LOT OF AREAS WE'VE SEEN

03:11:47.896 --> 03:11:51.166
DECLINES IN THIS VERY COMMON

03:11:51.233 --> 03:11:52.500
SPECIES.

03:11:52.567 --> 03:11:53.368
CALTRANS PICKS UP A TOP

03:11:53.435 --> 03:11:54.502
PROXIMALLY HUNDRED THOUSAND

03:11:54.569 --> 03:11:55.971
CARCASSES OF MEDIUM AND LARGE

03:11:56.037 --> 03:11:57.505
SIZE ANIMALS A YEAR FROM

03:11:57.572 --> 03:11:58.874
CALIFORNIA STATE HIGHWAYS.

03:11:58.940 --> 03:12:00.442
IN THE ESTIMATES FOR ROAD KILL

03:12:00.508 --> 03:12:01.810
IN THE UNITED STATES ARE ABOUT

03:12:01.877 --> 03:12:03.245
ONE MILLION ANIMALS PER DAY OR

03:12:03.311 --> 03:12:03.879
HIT.

03:12:03.945 --> 03:12:05.714
A CALIFORNIA USUALLY HAS ABOUT

03:12:05.780 --> 03:12:07.949
10% OF EVERYTHING SO IT'S A

03:12:08.016 --> 03:12:08.984
HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY.

03:12:09.050 --> 03:12:10.185
AS WAS NOTED WE DON'T HAVE ANY

03:12:10.252 --> 03:12:11.953
FORMAL STATE PROGRAM TO TREAT

03:12:12.020 --> 03:12:13.355
THIS PROBLEM.

03:12:13.421 --> 03:12:15.190
IT DOES COST US ABOUT THREE

03:12:15.257 --> 03:12:16.157
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

03:12:16.224 --> 03:12:17.893
IN PROPERTY DAMAGE LOSS OF

03:12:17.959 --> 03:12:19.961
WILDLIFE INJURY AND DEATH --

03:12:20.028 --> 03:12:21.930
JUST IN CALIFORNIA -- SO ANY

03:12:21.997 --> 03:12:24.099
PROGRAM THAT CAN HELP US REDUCE

03:12:24.165 --> 03:12:25.200
THIS COST IS GOING TO BE

03:12:25.267 --> 03:12:27.636
BENEFICIAL THE PRIMARY BENEFIT I

03:12:27.702 --> 03:12:30.238
SEE OUT OF SB THREE NINETY FIVE

03:12:30.305 --> 03:12:32.307
IS IN THE DATA COLLECTION -- WE

03:12:32.374 --> 03:12:33.808
ARE AS I SAID WE ARE THE PRIMARY

03:12:33.875 --> 03:12:36.845
DATA PROVIDER FOR THE STATE.

03:12:36.912 --> 03:12:38.346
FOR WHILE THE VEHICLE COLLISION

03:12:38.413 --> 03:12:39.547
DATA ROAD KILL DATA.

03:12:39.614 --> 03:12:41.616
AND WE COULD ALWAYS USE MORE OF

03:12:41.683 --> 03:12:42.684
IT.

03:12:42.751 --> 03:12:43.919
IN OTHER STATES FOR EXAMPLE

03:12:43.985 --> 03:12:45.420
IDAHO WHERE THEY HAVE A VERY

03:12:45.487 --> 03:12:47.689
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM -- AND THEIR

03:12:47.756 --> 03:12:49.124
ROAD KILL MONITORING PROGRAM IS

03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:50.792
MODELED AFTER HOURS -- THEY HAD

03:12:50.859 --> 03:12:53.695
ABOUT A 25% INCREASE IN THEIR

03:12:53.762 --> 03:12:54.262
DATA COLLECTION IN THE FIRST

03:12:54.329 --> 03:12:56.531
YEAR -- AND THEY HAVE NOT FACED

03:12:56.598 --> 03:12:57.766
ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUES IN

03:12:57.832 --> 03:12:59.401
THE USE THOSE DATA TO HELP MAKE

03:12:59.467 --> 03:13:01.970
DECISIONS -- I THINK THAT IF WE

03:13:02.037 --> 03:13:03.204
HAD A SIMILAR KIND OF DATA

03:13:03.271 --> 03:13:05.173
INGESTION DATA COLLECTION

03:13:05.240 --> 03:13:06.641
PROCESS HERE -- IT WOULD GO A

03:13:06.708 --> 03:13:09.110
LONG WAY TO HELPING MITIGATE

03:13:09.177 --> 03:13:11.012
THIS CRITICAL IMPACT THAT AND I

03:13:11.079 --> 03:13:12.814
SAY CRITICAL BECAUSE FOR THE

03:13:12.881 --> 03:13:15.283
PEOPLE WHO DRIVE.

03:13:15.350 --> 03:13:16.751
IT'S MY TO IN A MINUTE I KNOW

03:13:16.818 --> 03:13:18.520
THAT IT'S IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS

03:13:18.586 --> 03:13:21.122
WHEN YOU HAD A LARGE ANIMAL ON A

03:13:21.189 --> 03:13:22.857
HIGHWAY -- BUT IT'S ALSO PREFER

03:13:22.924 --> 03:13:24.025
CRITICAL FOR WILDLIFE IN OUR

03:13:24.092 --> 03:13:25.293
STATE AGENCIES AND OTHER STATES

03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:26.594
HAVE RECOGNIZED THIS IS ONE OF

03:13:26.661 --> 03:13:28.263
THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF DEATH FOR

03:13:28.330 --> 03:13:34.836
WILDLIFE -- IS -- BEING HIT BY

03:13:34.903 --> 03:13:35.203
CARS THANK YOU.

03:13:35.270 --> 03:13:35.770
VERY GOOD.

SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE BILL

03:17:17.692 --> 03:17:18.993

MY MY A ONLY HAVE A COUPLE

03:17:20.762 --> 03:17:21.896
QUESTIONS AS THE FIRST OF ALL

03:17:21.963 --> 03:17:23.898
HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THE BILL

03:17:23.965 --> 03:17:25.333
DOESN'T LEAD TO POACHING.

03:17:25.400 --> 03:17:27.835
I THINK THAT WAS AT THE HEART OF

03:17:27.902 --> 03:17:29.237
THE GAME WARDENS CONCERNS.

03:17:29.304 --> 03:17:31.239
YOU KNOW HAVING AB HUNTER

03:17:31.306 --> 03:17:33.208
SHOOTING ELK IN WE INTIMATES

03:17:33.274 --> 03:17:36.644
MENTIONS IN THE IN HOUSE IS THAT

03:17:36.711 --> 03:17:37.278
IT'S ACTUALLY HARD TO GET THOSE

03:17:37.345 --> 03:17:38.112
TAGS.

03:17:38.179 --> 03:17:39.214
MAYBE THE SCENE ANIMAL THAT THEY

03:17:39.280 --> 03:17:41.015
HAVE BEEN MEANING TO THEY WANT.

03:17:41.082 --> 03:17:42.984
TO HI AND N. H. SHOOT IT MANY

03:17:43.051 --> 03:17:43.918
SAY WAS A BY A CAR.

03:17:43.985 --> 03:17:46.221
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE -- THAT

03:17:46.287 --> 03:17:47.589
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPENING

03:17:47.655 --> 03:17:47.989
ON TO THIS BILL.

03:17:48.056 --> 03:17:49.924
WELL THE CENTER DR TALKED WITH

03:17:49.991 --> 03:17:51.626
THE GAME WARDENS AND AND I'LL

03:17:51.693 --> 03:17:54.362
LET -- THE SENATOR TALK AS WELL.

03:17:54.429 --> 03:17:56.831
BUT IN MY CONVERSATION WITH THEM

03:17:56.898 --> 03:17:58.766
THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT IF AND

03:17:58.833 --> 03:18:00.335
WHEN THE ANIMALS IS HIT.

03:18:00.401 --> 03:18:02.303
IT IS OF OF PULLED TO THE SIDE

03:18:02.370 --> 03:18:04.672
AND THEY CAN TELL IF IT WAS

03:18:04.739 --> 03:18:06.040
POACHERS INVOLVED.

03:18:06.107 --> 03:18:08.009
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE THE

03:18:08.076 --> 03:18:09.644
WAY THE ANIMALS HIT WAS KILLED

03:18:09.711 --> 03:18:12.080
WHATEVER BUT DEADLY GAME WARDENS.

03:18:12.146 --> 03:18:13.715
ARE RIGHT ON IT AND SO THEY'VE

03:18:13.781 --> 03:18:15.683
TOLD ME THAT -- THAT IS

03:18:15.750 --> 03:18:17.118
SOMETHING THEY'RE LOOKING AT

03:18:17.185 --> 03:18:19.954
EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THEIR THEIR

03:18:20.021 --> 03:18:21.489
VERY MUCH IN TUNE WHICH TAKEN

03:18:21.556 --> 03:18:22.357
PLACE.

03:18:22.423 --> 03:18:23.858
AND THEY KNOW THAT THIS BILL

03:18:23.925 --> 03:18:25.927
WILL TAKE CARE OF AS SOMEONE

03:18:25.994 --> 03:18:28.329
OPPOSED IT -- BUT WE HAVE TO

03:18:28.396 --> 03:18:29.964
UNDERSTAND THAT THE POSSIBILITY

03:18:30.031 --> 03:18:31.532
OF KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE THEY'RE

03:18:31.599 --> 03:18:32.634
COMING FROM.

03:18:32.700 --> 03:18:33.935
THE CROSSING THERE ARE HAVING

03:18:34.002 --> 03:18:35.436
THERE IS FEDERAL MONEY AND I

03:18:35.503 --> 03:18:36.704
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO MENTION

03:18:36.771 --> 03:18:38.106
THAT BUT FOR MONEY FOR OAK

03:18:38.172 --> 03:18:40.975
OVERPASSES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE

03:18:41.042 --> 03:18:42.644
ANIMALS AND THIS WILL PREVENT.

03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:45.647
ADDITIONAL -- COLLISIONS BUT AS

03:18:45.713 --> 03:18:46.814
FAR AS THE POACHING.

03:18:46.881 --> 03:18:48.416
THAT'S FOR THE GAME WORDS OF

03:18:48.483 --> 03:18:49.984
COMMAND THEY'RE THEY'RE ON IT SO

03:18:50.051 --> 03:18:51.319
THAT THEY CENTER L. IF I MAY

03:18:51.386 --> 03:18:52.854
WHAT WE DID IN OREGON IS THAT WE

03:18:52.920 --> 03:18:55.657
CAN FIND THE SALVAGE OPPORTUNITY.

03:18:55.723 --> 03:18:57.091
TO THE ROAD RIGHT AWAY.

03:18:57.158 --> 03:18:59.360
SO -- IF SOMEBODY WENT IN THE

03:18:59.427 --> 03:19:01.462
HIGH COUNTRY AND AND KILL AN

03:19:01.529 --> 03:19:03.665
ANIMAL OR POSTED -- AND DRUG IT

03:19:03.731 --> 03:19:05.700
ALL THE WAY BACK TO A ROAD AND

03:19:05.767 --> 03:19:08.069
THEN WENT ON THE APP TO GET IT --

03:19:08.136 --> 03:19:16.077
IT SEEM LIKE A POACHERS DON'T

03:19:16.144 --> 03:19:17.512
WANT TO HAVE THAT EXT.

03:19:17.578 --> 03:19:18.813
MORE LIKELY JUST TO TAKE IT HOME

03:19:18.880 --> 03:19:19.947
WE WE WORKED WITH -- THE F. AND

03:19:20.014 --> 03:19:20.882
W. R. DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE

03:19:20.948 --> 03:19:21.716
REALIZE THAT -- YOU DO

03:19:21.783 --> 03:19:22.450
EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO KEEP

03:19:22.517 --> 03:19:23.651
POACHING FROM HAPPENING.

03:19:23.718 --> 03:19:26.220
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY --

03:19:26.287 --> 03:19:27.655
NOTHING IS GOING TO BE A FOOL

03:19:27.722 --> 03:19:29.157
PROOF ON THAT WHAT DOES IT BUT

03:19:29.223 --> 03:19:32.160
IT RAISES THE PROBLEM HERE.

03:19:32.226 --> 03:19:33.261
THAT I'M.

03:19:33.328 --> 03:19:34.295
YOU CAN GO YOU CAN CHANGE THE

03:19:34.362 --> 03:19:36.631
ANIMAL IF IT'S HIT BY THE CAR

03:19:36.698 --> 03:19:38.199
AND I MEAN YOU.

03:19:38.266 --> 03:19:40.201
YOU KNOW.

03:19:40.268 --> 03:19:41.803
BUT ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS WHERE

03:19:41.869 --> 03:19:42.670
WHAT HAPPENS AT THE SIDE OF THE

03:19:42.737 --> 03:19:45.039
ROAD IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.

03:19:45.106 --> 03:19:46.374
WHAT IF THE ANIMAL WALKS FIFTY

03:19:46.441 --> 03:19:47.909
FEET ON THE PRIVATE PROPERTY

03:19:47.975 --> 03:19:49.210
BEFORE FALLING?

03:19:49.277 --> 03:19:50.278
WHICH DID YOU WANTED BLOOD

03:19:50.345 --> 03:19:52.080
UNTRAINED UNLICENSED PERSON TO

03:19:52.146 --> 03:19:53.147
GO OUT AND YOU KNOW.

03:19:53.214 --> 03:19:55.083
FIRE GUN ON THAT PRIVATE

03:19:55.149 --> 03:19:57.185
PROPERTY IN.

03:19:57.251 --> 03:19:58.753
IN ARBIL IN OREGON YOU COULD NOT

03:19:58.820 --> 03:20:00.455
SELL HE SAID IF -- GET OFF THE

03:20:00.521 --> 03:20:03.057
ROAD RIGHT AWAY YOU CAN SALVAGE.

03:20:03.124 --> 03:20:05.993
BUT IN THIS BILL IT SEEMS TO BE

03:20:06.060 --> 03:20:07.395
STILL PERMITTED NOW.

03:20:07.462 --> 03:20:09.664
NO THE IDEA IS THAT IF AGAIN IF

03:20:09.731 --> 03:20:11.265
THE COLLISION HERS IN AN AT THE

03:20:11.332 --> 03:20:12.700
ANIMAL KEEPS GOING.

03:20:12.767 --> 03:20:14.669
THE IDEAS WITH THE APT TO RECORD

03:20:14.736 --> 03:20:16.537
EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WE'RE

03:20:16.604 --> 03:20:18.172
LOOKING FOR THE DATA. TO ENSURE

03:20:18.239 --> 03:20:19.474
WE KNOW OR THE THE ANIMALS COME

03:20:19.540 --> 03:20:22.243
TOGETHER AND EVENTUALLY THAT THE

03:20:22.310 --> 03:20:23.911
ROVER PAST COULD BE BUILT THAT'S

03:20:23.978 --> 03:20:25.046
THE IDEA.

03:20:25.113 --> 03:20:27.682
AND AGAIN THAT FOR THE FISH

03:20:27.749 --> 03:20:29.584
WILDLIFE THE GAME WARDENS THEY

03:20:29.650 --> 03:20:32.019
KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE EXPERTS AT

03:20:32.086 --> 03:20:33.254
THIS AND IF AND IF SOMEONE POACH

03:20:33.321 --> 03:20:35.323
THEY CAN TELL AS AN ANIMAL WAS --

03:20:35.390 --> 03:20:36.924
BROUGHT ON TO THE ROADSIDE THEY

03:20:36.991 --> 03:20:39.494
KNOW THAT SHOW -- EVERY

03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:40.128
EVERYTHING BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN

03:20:40.194 --> 03:20:42.563
LOOKED AT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:20:42.630 --> 03:20:43.965
FOLLOW THE REST OF THE STATE'S

03:20:44.031 --> 03:20:45.433
THE THINGS THAT THAT WE'RE DOING

03:20:45.500 --> 03:20:46.467
AND THAT'S WHY.

03:20:46.534 --> 03:20:47.535
SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT

03:20:47.602 --> 03:20:48.703
WE'RE PUTTING INTO THE BILL TO

03:20:48.770 --> 03:20:50.772
GO TAKE IT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD --

03:20:50.838 --> 03:20:52.140
HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOOKED AT JOE

03:20:52.206 --> 03:20:54.509
AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT -- YOU

03:20:54.575 --> 03:20:56.077
HAD MENTIONED ABOUT SHOOTING.

03:20:56.144 --> 03:20:57.678
THE THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T

03:20:57.745 --> 03:20:59.914
TAKE AWAY FROM THE LOSS OF THAT

03:20:59.981 --> 03:21:01.949
ARE ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW

03:21:02.016 --> 03:21:03.151
PERTAINING TO SOMEONE.

03:21:03.217 --> 03:21:04.419
CARRYING A HANDGUN OR CARRYING A

03:21:04.485 --> 03:21:07.422
RIFLE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE --

03:21:07.488 --> 03:21:12.160
PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO BE LICENSED

03:21:12.226 --> 03:21:13.728
TO CARRY HAND GOT.

03:21:13.795 --> 03:21:15.062
SO THAT THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE.

03:21:15.129 --> 03:21:16.697
GOOD DOESN'T DEVIATE FROM THAT

03:21:16.764 --> 03:21:17.098
DATA.

03:21:17.165 --> 03:21:18.399
OF THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE ON THE

03:21:18.466 --> 03:21:20.168
BOOKS.

03:21:20.234 --> 03:21:21.068
I ASKED THE CASHIER THE

03:21:21.135 --> 03:21:22.003
COMMITTEE DID UST.

03:21:22.069 --> 03:21:25.072
GIVE ME A SENSE OF OF HOW THE

03:21:25.139 --> 03:21:26.641
I'M AMENDMENTS MAY HAVE ADDRESS

03:21:26.707 --> 03:21:28.075
TO GO TO THE FIFTH AMENDMENT GO

03:21:28.142 --> 03:21:29.977
TO PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS OKAY

03:21:30.044 --> 03:21:32.613
THIS IS WHAT SENATOR ARCHULETA I

03:21:32.680 --> 03:21:33.414
BELIEVE WAS REFERRING

03:21:33.481 --> 03:21:33.714
[inaudible]

03:21:33.781 --> 03:21:37.985
TO SO.

03:21:38.052 --> 03:21:41.389
ON PAGE FOR A MINUTE UNTIL PAGE

03:21:41.456 --> 03:21:43.391
TEN THE NOW SYSTEM AND FIVE ALL

03:21:43.458 --> 03:21:44.926
STATE AND LOCAL LAWS OF A AND

03:21:44.992 --> 03:21:46.260
AND REGULATIONS APPLY WITH THE

03:21:46.327 --> 03:21:47.295
EXCEPTION.

03:21:47.361 --> 03:21:48.663
OF THE REQUIREMENT TO POSSESS A

03:21:48.729 --> 03:21:50.131
VALID HUNTING LICENSE IN

03:21:50.198 --> 03:21:52.066
APPLICABLE TAG SO IN OTHER WORDS.

03:21:52.133 --> 03:21:54.335
A LOG -- BARRING DISCHARGE A

03:21:54.402 --> 03:21:58.940
FIRE ARM ON THE ON A STATE ROAD --

03:21:59.006 --> 03:22:02.376
TRESPASSING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY --

03:22:02.443 --> 03:22:05.146
SO SO THE THE CHAIN THE REAL

03:22:05.213 --> 03:22:08.349
SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IN LAW THAT.

03:22:08.416 --> 03:22:09.784
I CAN SPEAK FOR CENTER ARCHER

03:22:09.851 --> 03:22:11.385
LETTER THE SEEKING IS THAT.

03:22:11.452 --> 03:22:13.321
THAT HUNTING LICENSE AND TAG

03:22:13.387 --> 03:22:15.690
REQUIREMENTS FOR ANIMALS STRUCK

03:22:15.756 --> 03:22:20.962
ON THE ROADS -- BUT BEYOND THAT --

03:22:21.028 --> 03:22:22.797
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE ANY

03:22:22.864 --> 03:22:24.665
FURTHER CHANGES BEING MADE I I

03:22:24.732 --> 03:22:28.135
WILL SAY I DO I DO SHARE YOUR

03:22:28.202 --> 03:22:29.537
TREPIDATION ABOUT.

03:22:29.604 --> 03:22:32.640
YOU KNOW SOME OPEN DOOR -- TO

03:22:32.707 --> 03:22:33.841
POACHING THAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE

03:22:33.908 --> 03:22:36.577
ANTICIPATED HERE AND I I KNOW

03:22:36.644 --> 03:22:37.211
WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON

03:22:37.278 --> 03:22:40.214
TRYING -- TO IT IS TIED UP ANY

03:22:40.281 --> 03:22:42.049
POTENTIAL LOOPHOLES IN THIS THAT

03:22:42.116 --> 03:22:44.018
THAT MIGHT LEAD TO THOSE

03:22:44.085 --> 03:22:45.520
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE

03:22:45.586 --> 03:22:46.053
YOU KNOW.

03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:47.688
WE DON'T WE WE WANT TO BE FULL

03:22:47.755 --> 03:22:49.624
PROOF WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE

03:22:49.690 --> 03:22:50.224
THAT'S WHAT WE ENDEAVOR TO DO

03:22:50.291 --> 03:22:50.925
HERE.

03:22:50.992 --> 03:22:52.493
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:54.495
WITH THE AMEND WE'VE ADDED UP

03:22:54.562 --> 03:22:56.964
MUCH MORE DISCRETION ALSO TO I

03:22:57.031 --> 03:22:58.566
BELIEVE THE FISHING GAME.

03:22:58.633 --> 03:23:02.436
COMMISSION -- TO PUT UP UP UP

03:23:02.503 --> 03:23:04.472
PROGRAM TOGETHER THAT WOULD

03:23:04.539 --> 03:23:07.174
DETER THAT KIND OF IMPACT BUT IF

03:23:07.241 --> 03:23:08.509
THE CENTERS UP FOR WILL WE CAN

03:23:08.576 --> 03:23:10.278
CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER AND

03:23:10.344 --> 03:23:11.779
AND MAKE SURE THAT -- THIS

03:23:11.846 --> 03:23:14.181
DOESN'T HIT THE FLOOR IN SOME

03:23:14.248 --> 03:23:15.483
FORM THAT'S GOING TO HAVE --

03:23:15.550 --> 03:23:16.651
SOME OPEN BACKED OR BECAUSE I I

03:23:16.717 --> 03:23:17.752
SHARE YOUR CONCERNS IN THAT

03:23:17.818 --> 03:23:18.719
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WAIT

03:23:18.786 --> 03:23:20.288
IN LINE BY THE WAY TO DO THIS

03:23:20.354 --> 03:23:22.456
RIGHT THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO GET.

03:23:22.523 --> 03:23:26.627
SOME OF THESE TAGS AND YOU KNOW

03:23:26.694 --> 03:23:28.262
WE DON'T WANT ANY -- NO FALSE

03:23:28.329 --> 03:23:30.498
POSITIVES BEING REPORTED BUT I

03:23:30.565 --> 03:23:31.799
MEAN IF YOU WITH YOUR WITH YOUR

03:23:31.866 --> 03:23:34.035
APPS IS THERE A WAY TO CAPTURE

03:23:34.101 --> 03:23:34.936
AT LEAST.

03:23:35.002 --> 03:23:37.471
THE IMAGE IN THE DATA SUCH THAT

03:23:37.538 --> 03:23:39.006
YOU COULD DISTINGUISH FROM.

03:23:39.073 --> 03:23:41.542
A ROAD KILL VERSES A GUNSHOT IS

03:23:41.609 --> 03:23:42.977
THE IT OR IS THAT YOUR TO BE ON

03:23:43.044 --> 03:23:44.345
THE SCOPE OF THE APPS RIGHT NOW

03:23:44.412 --> 03:23:46.314
ABSOLUTELY AND THE FIRST

03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:47.381
REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE AN

03:23:47.448 --> 03:23:48.783
IMAGE AND YOU COULD PUT IN LAW

03:23:48.849 --> 03:23:50.484
THAT THE PART OF THE PERMIT

03:23:50.551 --> 03:23:51.752
REQUIREMENT IS THAT IT'S AN

03:23:51.819 --> 03:23:52.553
IDENTIFIABLE.

03:23:52.620 --> 03:23:54.989
ANIMAL ANIMAL AND YOU CAN TELL

03:23:55.056 --> 03:23:56.190
THAT IT WAS NOT SHOT.

03:23:56.257 --> 03:23:58.159
I MEAN THAT'S HARD TO PROVE AND

03:23:58.225 --> 03:23:59.260
YOU WOULD IF IN THE CASE OF AN

03:23:59.327 --> 03:24:02.396
ELK HAVING DFW ON HAND TO CHECK

03:24:02.463 --> 03:24:03.731
IT OUT OR HAVE SOME KIND OF

03:24:03.798 --> 03:24:05.266
FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF IT TO MAKE

03:24:05.333 --> 03:24:06.167
SURE IT WAS A COLLISION NOT

03:24:06.233 --> 03:24:07.501
APPROACHING EVENT WOULD BE.

03:24:07.568 --> 03:24:09.236
PROBABLY CRITICAL IN THE CASE OF

03:24:09.303 --> 03:24:10.805
DEAR THOSE A VERY CALM AND AND

03:24:10.871 --> 03:24:12.073
THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF DFW

03:24:12.139 --> 03:24:14.475
EFFORT -- BUT SURE IMAGERY IS

03:24:14.542 --> 03:24:16.010
THE BEST WAY TO TO DO THAT IT'S

03:24:16.077 --> 03:24:20.214
HARD TO BE HARD TO HIDE -- THAT

03:24:20.281 --> 03:24:23.718
NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT AT WET IDAHO

03:24:23.784 --> 03:24:25.453
FOUND BECAUSE THEY HAD SIMILAR

03:24:25.519 --> 03:24:27.688
KINDS OF CONCERNS TEN YEARS AGO

03:24:27.755 --> 03:24:29.190
WAS THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE

03:24:29.256 --> 03:24:31.258
OF POACHING OR ADDITIONAL

03:24:31.325 --> 03:24:32.793
PROTEIN BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE

03:24:32.860 --> 03:24:35.162
A LOT OF POACHING IN CALIFORNIA --

03:24:35.229 --> 03:24:37.231
AND THEY DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE

03:24:37.298 --> 03:24:38.466
OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO COVER UP

03:24:38.532 --> 03:24:40.768
PUSHING EVENTS USING THIS.

03:24:40.835 --> 03:24:41.769
THIS.

03:24:41.836 --> 03:24:43.604
NEW LAW WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY

03:24:43.671 --> 03:24:45.773
REPORTING -- AND ANYBODY WHO

03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:47.975
REPORTS HAS TO BE IDENTIFIED

03:24:48.042 --> 03:24:49.210
WHICH THEN KIND OF BREAKS THE

03:24:49.276 --> 03:24:51.412
FIRST RULE OF COMMITTING A CRIME

03:24:51.479 --> 03:24:52.346
IS THAT YOU DON'T IDENTIFY

03:24:52.413 --> 03:24:52.913
YOURSELF.

03:24:52.980 --> 03:24:54.315
SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

03:24:54.382 --> 03:24:56.384
WAYS THAT IT JUST DOESN'T LEAD

03:24:56.450 --> 03:24:57.952
TO THAT HAPPENING AT LEAST THAT

03:24:58.019 --> 03:25:01.555
WAS IDAHO'S FINDING OVER THE

03:25:01.622 --> 03:25:03.991
LAST TEN YEARS.

03:25:04.058 --> 03:25:05.126
BUT I THINK EMPIRE REPORTED TO

03:25:05.192 --> 03:25:06.093
THIS AND YOU TALK.

03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:07.795
TO THE IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF FISH

03:25:07.862 --> 03:25:10.031
AND GAME PERSON ABOUT THIS.

03:25:10.097 --> 03:25:11.332
VERY GOOD OTHER QUESTIONS.

03:25:11.399 --> 03:25:14.001
WELL I AM I GUESS I'M I'M JUST

03:25:14.068 --> 03:25:15.703
YOU KNOW TRUSTING THAT THE TO

03:25:15.770 --> 03:25:17.038
THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF

03:25:17.104 --> 03:25:20.441
HAVE -- REALLY YEAH VETTED THESE

03:25:20.508 --> 03:25:22.209
ISSUES IN OUR ARE GONNA BE

03:25:22.276 --> 03:25:23.778
MONITORING THEM YEAH BUT AS THE

03:25:23.844 --> 03:25:25.413
KICK OFF AS THE NOW SAYS NO TO

03:25:25.479 --> 03:25:26.981
TO WORK IN PROGRESS SOME OF THE

03:25:27.048 --> 03:25:29.016
FISHING GAME WARDEN CONCERNS

03:25:29.083 --> 03:25:31.485
RAISED -- LATE NOT AS IN

03:25:31.552 --> 03:25:34.188
OPPOSITION BUT AS SOME ISSUES TO

03:25:34.255 --> 03:25:35.256
WORK THROUGH.

03:25:35.322 --> 03:25:36.524
I HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR A

03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:37.892
WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK

03:25:37.958 --> 03:25:39.460
WITH THEM.

03:25:39.527 --> 03:25:40.394
AS WELL AS WITH THE COMMITTEE IN

03:25:40.461 --> 03:25:41.395
MY RIGHT AND THAT IS AFTER RIGHT

03:25:41.462 --> 03:25:43.130
MISTER CHAIR REMEMBER WHAT WE'RE

03:25:43.197 --> 03:25:45.066
TRYING TO FIND HERE IS HOW TO

03:25:45.132 --> 03:25:46.901
SAVE LIVES TWENTY FOUR FOR

03:25:46.967 --> 03:25:47.702
COUNTIES.

03:25:47.768 --> 03:25:49.170
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE A FAMILY IN

03:25:49.236 --> 03:25:51.072
A VAN AND THEY HIT THAT ANIMAL

03:25:51.138 --> 03:25:52.973
AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM

03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:54.608
FISHING GAME INTO IN THE WARDENS

03:25:54.675 --> 03:25:56.510
AND SO ON THAT ANIMAL WILL GO

03:25:56.577 --> 03:25:57.812
RIGHT THROUGH THAT WINDSHIELD

03:25:57.878 --> 03:25:59.480
AND KIDS IN THE BACKSEAT.

03:25:59.547 --> 03:26:02.316
A DAMAGE WE'VE HAD AS I SAID

03:26:02.383 --> 03:26:03.918
FIFTEEN HUNDRED INJURIES AND

03:26:03.984 --> 03:26:05.586
TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND

03:26:05.653 --> 03:26:09.724
WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY.

03:26:09.790 --> 03:26:11.225
TO TO RECORD WHAT IS HAPPENING

03:26:11.292 --> 03:26:13.127
WHERE THE ANIMALS ARE COMING AND

03:26:13.194 --> 03:26:14.562
THAT'S THE IDEA.

03:26:14.628 --> 03:26:16.897
THE THOUGHT IS IF WE GIVE PEOPLE

03:26:16.964 --> 03:26:18.365
THIS RATE.

03:26:18.432 --> 03:26:19.967
THEY'RE GONNA BE MORE LIKELY.

03:26:20.034 --> 03:26:23.471
TO REMOVE THE ANIMAL FROM THE

03:26:23.537 --> 03:26:25.506
ROAD IN.

03:26:25.573 --> 03:26:26.307
THAT'S KIND OF THE CORE GOAL

03:26:26.373 --> 03:26:27.308
HERE THE THE THE IDEA IS GOD

03:26:27.374 --> 03:26:28.642
FORBID SOMETHING HAPPEN AND THEY

03:26:28.709 --> 03:26:29.443
HIT THE ANIMAL AND AND CORRECT

03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:31.612
ME IF I'M WRONG HERE. 99% OF THE

03:26:31.679 --> 03:26:32.646
TIME THE AND WILL SIT IN THE

03:26:32.713 --> 03:26:34.482
FALLS TO THE SIDE IT DOESN'T

03:26:34.548 --> 03:26:35.683
NORMALLY STAY IN THE MIDDLE OF

03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:37.151
THE ROAD FALL TO THE SIDE.

03:26:37.218 --> 03:26:38.519
AND IF PEOPLE GET OUT WHEN

03:26:38.586 --> 03:26:40.321
NORMALLY THEY SHOULD AND REPORT

03:26:40.387 --> 03:26:41.822
THE ACCIDENT IMMEDIATELY IN A

03:26:41.889 --> 03:26:43.524
MEETING HE GOES TO TO TO THE

03:26:43.591 --> 03:26:45.159
HIGHWAY PATROL TO CALTRANS.

03:26:45.226 --> 03:26:47.161
AND THE THE FISH AND GAME AND SO

03:26:47.228 --> 03:26:48.562
IT WAS TO DO THAT THAT THAT'S

03:26:48.629 --> 03:26:49.930
PART OF YOUR THAT'S THAT'S IT'S

03:26:49.997 --> 03:26:52.166
IN THERE SO THAT'S THE IDEA

03:26:52.233 --> 03:26:53.467
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE APP.

03:26:53.534 --> 03:26:55.002
SO EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IT'S

03:26:55.069 --> 03:26:56.670
HAPPENED WHERE IT'S HAPPENED AND

03:26:56.737 --> 03:26:58.539
WHEN WE HAVE THE DATA FOR THE

03:26:58.606 --> 03:26:59.840
FUTURE AND THEN STARRED GATOR

03:26:59.907 --> 03:27:01.609
GETTING THIS DATA TOGETHER SO WE

03:27:01.675 --> 03:27:03.043
CAN TAKE THE NEXT COURSE OF

03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:04.078
ACTION IS.

03:27:04.145 --> 03:27:05.546
TO IF IT'S IT CONCENTRATED IN

03:27:05.613 --> 03:27:07.615
ONE AREA DAN THIS IS WHERE THE

03:27:07.681 --> 03:27:08.849
OVER PAST COULD BE BUILT.

03:27:08.916 --> 03:27:10.451
WHEN SOMEBODY HAD JUST?

03:27:10.518 --> 03:27:11.819
MENTIONED ABOUT THE ANIMALS

03:27:11.886 --> 03:27:13.754
THAT'S THE WAY TO ALSO SAY THE

03:27:13.821 --> 03:27:15.422
ANIMAL AND TO SAVE LIVES SO

03:27:15.489 --> 03:27:16.423
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE

03:27:16.490 --> 03:27:17.825
LIKE A WILDLIFE COURT THE THE

03:27:17.892 --> 03:27:19.226
WILDLIFE TO WE'VE GOT TO BRING

03:27:19.293 --> 03:27:21.028
OVER WHAT'LL HAPPEN.

03:27:21.095 --> 03:27:22.496
IT IT'S THEY CREATE THIS FISHING

03:27:22.563 --> 03:27:23.597
I'M SORRY THIS FRENCH IN THAT

03:27:23.664 --> 03:27:25.466
KIND OF A V. SHAPE AND IT JUST

03:27:25.533 --> 03:27:27.067
HURDLE JUMP INTO.

03:27:27.134 --> 03:27:33.974
THE OVER PASS AND THAT THE IDEA.

03:27:34.041 --> 03:27:35.776
SO SUCCESSFUL OF LOCATION THE

03:27:35.843 --> 03:27:36.977
THE THE YOU WOULD SEE THE FENCES

03:27:37.044 --> 03:27:38.045
IN A V. SHAPE AND YOU WOULD SEE

03:27:38.112 --> 03:27:39.146
AT THE OVER PASS TO THE ANIMALS

03:27:39.213 --> 03:27:39.747
WILL GO RIGHT OVER THE TOP.

03:27:39.814 --> 03:27:41.282
ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT WOULD JUST

03:27:41.348 --> 03:27:42.883
BE TO REQUIRE DRIVERS.

03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:44.552
TO REPORT.

03:27:44.618 --> 03:27:46.153
ANIMAL RELATED ACCIDENTS JUST

03:27:46.220 --> 03:27:46.687
LIKE THEY WERE REQUIRED TO

03:27:46.754 --> 03:27:48.956
REPORT.

03:27:49.023 --> 03:27:50.591
EXCELLENT AND SOME PEOPLE

03:27:50.658 --> 03:27:53.160
OBVIOUSLY IF THE DAMAGES IS SO

03:27:53.227 --> 03:27:53.994
SEVERE THEY'RE GONNA THEY'RE

03:27:54.061 --> 03:27:55.563
GONNA OBVIOUSLY CALL THE HIVE

03:27:55.629 --> 03:27:56.964
JOYS THAT MENTION AND CALTRANS

03:27:57.031 --> 03:27:58.566
EVERYBODY ELSE THE AMBULANCES

03:27:58.632 --> 03:27:59.133
ROLL.

03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:02.036
THEY'LL TAKE YOUR THE THE

03:28:02.102 --> 03:28:03.037
FIFTEEN HUNDRED LIKE THE FIFTEEN

03:28:03.103 --> 03:28:03.938
HUNDRED INJURIES IT'S HAPPENING

03:28:04.004 --> 03:28:05.739
SO WE'VE GOT O FIND A WAY OF

03:28:05.806 --> 03:28:07.074
RECORDING IT THIS IS THE FIRST

03:28:07.141 --> 03:28:07.741
STEP.

03:28:07.808 --> 03:28:09.243
AND THAT'S WHY I'M OPEN TO

03:28:09.310 --> 03:28:11.178
AMENDMENTS AND AND AND AND

03:28:11.245 --> 03:28:13.981
FUTURE -- CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE

03:28:14.048 --> 03:28:16.617
IT -- A VIABLE WAY OF SAVING

03:28:16.684 --> 03:28:18.352
LIVES IN PREVENTING INJURIES AND

03:28:18.419 --> 03:28:20.287
WE CAN DO IT IN A IN A

03:28:20.354 --> 03:28:21.622
SYSTEMATIC WAY.

03:28:21.689 --> 03:28:23.791
THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THEY

03:28:23.858 --> 03:28:25.092
COULD JUST HIT THAT APP.

03:28:25.159 --> 03:28:26.627
EVERYONE WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

03:28:26.694 --> 03:28:28.095
HAPPENED AND PEOPLE COULD ROLL

03:28:28.162 --> 03:28:31.932
ON THIS THING WHICH IS I WILL

03:28:31.999 --> 03:28:33.801
CONTROL.

03:28:33.868 --> 03:28:34.768
AND YOU WANTED TO YES SO THE

03:28:34.835 --> 03:28:35.402
CURRENTLY IS VERY DISCRETIONARY

03:28:35.469 --> 03:28:35.936
I MEAN YOU COULD PUT THAT

03:28:36.003 --> 03:28:36.637
REQUIREMENT IN BUT MOST OF THESE

03:28:36.704 --> 03:28:37.872
INCIDENTS ARE OCCURRING WITHOUT

03:28:37.938 --> 03:28:39.173
ANYBODY NEARBY.

03:28:39.240 --> 03:28:41.508
AND SO REQUIRING PEOPLE TO

03:28:41.575 --> 03:28:43.611
REPORT IS MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO

03:28:43.677 --> 03:28:44.979
SUCCEED IN GIVING THEM AN

03:28:45.045 --> 03:28:47.147
INCENTIVE NOT NOT TO INTERRUPT

03:28:47.214 --> 03:28:48.415
THE DOCTOR WE DID.

03:28:48.482 --> 03:28:50.117
PUT THAT REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO

03:42:34.574 --> 03:42:36.876
WE OPPOSE THIS BILL A VERY

03:42:36.943 --> 03:42:38.344
SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR.

03:42:38.411 --> 03:42:40.346
PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE RESOLUTELY

03:42:40.413 --> 03:42:42.215
THAN I INTENDED.

03:42:42.282 --> 03:42:44.317
I THINK THAT -- WE'RE OPPOSED TO

03:42:44.384 --> 03:42:46.186
THIS BILL FOR THREE REASONS ONE

03:42:46.252 --> 03:42:47.754
IS THAT IT CREATES A NEW LEVEL.

03:42:47.821 --> 03:42:50.390
OF SCRUTINY BY.

03:42:50.457 --> 03:42:51.891
STATE PARKS WHICH COULD IMPACT

03:42:51.958 --> 03:42:53.493
ANY KIND OF LAND PURCHASES THAT

03:42:53.560 --> 03:42:56.029
THEY HAVE. TO THAT THE BILL IS

03:42:56.096 --> 03:42:57.330
REALLY ONLY HALF WRITTEN.

03:42:57.397 --> 03:42:58.631
IT GIVES A PRESCRIPTION AS TO

03:42:58.698 --> 03:43:01.501
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IF THE

03:43:01.568 --> 03:43:04.037
DEPARTMENT DOES THIS -- HEARING

03:43:04.104 --> 03:43:04.838
THAT THEY SHOULD SELL THE

03:43:04.904 --> 03:43:07.040
PROPERTY AND WHAT THE PROPERTY

03:43:07.107 --> 03:43:09.008
COULD BE SOLD.

03:43:09.075 --> 03:43:11.678
FOR HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT.

03:43:11.745 --> 03:43:12.779
I THINK THAT THE SENATORS A VERY

03:43:12.846 --> 03:43:14.614
CONSCIENTIOUS AND PRAGMATIC

03:43:14.681 --> 03:43:15.415
PERSON.

03:43:15.482 --> 03:43:17.817
AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING WE

03:43:17.884 --> 03:43:19.385
ARE GOING TO HEAR THIS BILL

03:43:19.452 --> 03:43:21.855
EVERY SINGLE YEAR UNTIL I DIE.

03:43:21.921 --> 03:43:23.256
<u>ND SO.</u>

03:43:23.323 --> 03:43:25.225
MY SUGGESTION AND THIS IS A

03:43:25.291 --> 03:43:28.094
SUGGESTION AND I I RAN IT BY.

03:43:28.161 --> 03:43:31.297
MISTER CRAVEN JUST BRIEFLY.

03:43:31.364 --> 03:43:32.365
IS THE IDEA THAT WE DO SOMETHING

03:43:32.432 --> 03:43:34.134
WE'RE BOTH PARTIES HAVE SKIN IN

03:43:34.200 --> 03:43:35.468
THE GAME.

03:43:35.535 --> 03:43:36.703
CLEARLY [inaudible]

03:43:36.770 --> 03:43:39.072
PARKS.

03:43:39.139 --> 03:43:41.174
I WAS VERY CAREFUL IN SETTING

03:43:41.241 --> 03:43:42.675
THIS PARK ASIDE THERE WERE THE

03:43:42.742 --> 03:43:44.177
PUBLIC HEARINGS THERE'S A

03:43:44.244 --> 03:43:45.578
HISTORY OF MOTORCYCLE RIDING

03:43:45.645 --> 03:43:46.513
HERE.

03:43:46.579 --> 03:43:48.148
THERE'S A NECESSITY FOR A PARK

03:43:48.214 --> 03:43:50.116
IN THIS AREA.

03:43:50.183 --> 03:43:52.118
HOWEVER IF THEY DIDN'T DO

03:43:52.185 --> 03:43:53.787
EVERYTHING AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED.

03:43:53.853 --> 03:43:57.023
TO MY SUGGESTION IS.

03:43:57.090 --> 03:43:59.359
IT HAS NO VESTED INTEREST IN

03:43:59.425 --> 03:44:00.160
THIS.

03:44:00.226 --> 03:44:01.361
IF WE DO IT WITH PARKS WHICH IS

03:44:01.427 --> 03:44:02.428
KIND OF THE SAME HEARINGS OVER

03:44:02.495 --> 03:44:04.164
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND

03:44:04.230 --> 03:44:07.367
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE.

03:44:07.433 --> 03:44:09.335
AN ARBITRATOR TO LOOK AT AT WHAT

03:44:09.402 --> 03:44:11.604
HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF PUTTING

03:44:11.671 --> 03:44:13.339
THIS PROJECT TOGETHER.

03:44:13.406 --> 03:44:15.375
IF THEY DECIDE THAT PARKS DID

03:44:15.441 --> 03:44:16.810
EVERYTHING CORRECTLY THAT THERE

03:44:16.876 --> 03:44:17.944
IS A NEED.

03:44:18.011 --> 03:44:19.279
THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE

03:44:19.345 --> 03:44:22.048
NEARBY EITHER SIGNED OFF OR WERE

03:44:22.115 --> 03:44:23.550
GIVEN EASEMENTS IN THE PROCESS

03:44:23.616 --> 03:44:24.784
IN THE PROCESS.

03:44:24.851 --> 03:44:27.153
OF THE PROJECT GOES FORWARD.

03:44:27.220 --> 03:44:28.922
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT IT IS NEVER

03:44:28.988 --> 03:44:30.523
GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT THERE

03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:32.692
ARE REASONS ENVIRONMENTAL OR FOR

03:44:32.759 --> 03:44:34.794
WHATEVER BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO

03:44:34.861 --> 03:44:35.328
HAPPEN.

03:44:35.395 --> 03:44:38.164
THEN THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE SOLD.

03:44:38.231 --> 03:44:39.766
THEN IT SHOULD BE SOLD AT THE

03:44:39.833 --> 03:44:41.534
PRICE BUT IT'S WORTH RIGHT NOW

03:44:41.601 --> 03:44:43.102
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GET ANYBODY

03:44:43.169 --> 03:44:44.637
INTO TROUBLE BY MAKING THIS A

03:44:44.704 --> 03:44:47.640
GIFT OF PROPERTY FROM THE STATE

03:44:47.707 --> 03:44:48.741
SO WE COULD.

03:44:48.808 --> 03:44:50.710
GET UP AN APPROPRIATE PRICE AND

03:44:50.777 --> 03:44:52.278

PROTRACTED NEGOTIATION. TO TO

04:24:31.322 --> 04:24:32.656

CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE.

04:24:35.159 --> 04:24:37.361
CONVENING AS MANY AS I THINK

04:24:37.428 --> 04:24:38.095
SEVENTY PEOPLE AT TIMES IN THE

04:24:38.162 --> 04:24:39.830
ROOM TRYING TO COME UP WITH AN

04:24:39.897 --> 04:24:40.998
AGREEMENT TO DEAL WITH

04:24:41.065 --> 04:24:42.900
CONSERVATION IS YOU KNOW.

04:24:42.967 --> 04:24:44.335
A COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE GOVERNOR

04:24:44.401 --> 04:24:46.203
HAD AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE

04:24:46.270 --> 04:24:48.272
EXECUTIVE ORDER ASK FOR CERTAIN

04:24:48.339 --> 04:24:49.907
LEVELS OF CONSERVATION WAS

04:24:49.974 --> 04:24:50.975
PRETTY SUCCESSFUL.

04:24:51.041 --> 04:24:52.376
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WAS IN THE

04:24:52.443 --> 04:24:53.777
LARGER ARCHITECTURE OF WATER

04:24:53.844 --> 04:24:56.480
POLICY TO BE ABLE.

04:24:56.547 --> 04:24:57.314
TO DEAL WITH THE OTHER ISSUES

04:24:57.381 --> 04:24:58.882
CERTAINLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

04:24:58.949 --> 04:25:00.584
QUALITY OF DRINKING WATER A

04:25:00.651 --> 04:25:01.852
REMAINING ISSUE IS PART OF THE

04:25:01.919 --> 04:25:03.187
ARCHITECTURE OF WHAT WE'VE GOT

04:25:03.254 --> 04:25:04.688
TO DEAL WITH.

04:25:04.755 --> 04:25:05.189
BUT THIS HAD TO DO WITH

04:25:05.256 --> 04:25:06.156
CONSERVATION.

04:25:06.223 --> 04:25:08.726
AND SO ON AND THAT WAS A YOU A

04:25:08.792 --> 04:25:10.861
TWO BILLS SIX OH SIX WHICH WAS

04:25:10.928 --> 04:25:12.730
OUR BILL IN THE SENATE.

04:25:12.796 --> 04:25:14.565
AND THE ASSEMBLY BILL I DON'T

04:25:14.632 --> 04:25:15.532
REMEMBER THE NUMBERS HERE BUT IT

04:25:15.599 --> 04:25:17.301
HAD TO DO WAS A SUMMER FRIEDMAN

04:25:17.368 --> 04:25:18.602
TO THEY WERE PART OF THE PACKAGE

04:25:18.669 --> 04:25:21.105
AT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED.

04:25:21.171 --> 04:25:23.240
AND I'M OUR SOLUTION THAT WAS TO

04:25:23.307 --> 04:25:24.375
COME UP WITH AN INDIVIDUAL AS

04:25:24.441 --> 04:25:26.110
WATER USE OBJECTIVE DETERMINING

04:25:26.176 --> 04:25:27.678
BY THE SUM OF MULTIPLE FACTORS

04:25:27.745 --> 04:25:29.413
THAT MEANS THAT WATER SUPPLIERS

04:25:29.480 --> 04:25:32.016
WERE TO FIND SAVINGS ACROSS THE

04:25:32.082 --> 04:25:32.483
RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL

04:25:32.549 --> 04:25:33.417
INDUSTRIAL.

04:25:33.484 --> 04:25:36.153
WATER LOSS AND OUTDOOR USE A ONE

04:25:36.220 --> 04:25:37.921
OF THE GREAT CRITICISMS THAT

04:25:37.988 --> 04:25:39.823
WITH AFTER THIS THING CAME ABOUT

04:25:39.890 --> 04:25:40.924
GROUPS ARE SAYING -- I CAN'T

04:25:40.991 --> 04:25:42.192
FLUSH MY TOILET AND TAKE A

04:25:42.259 --> 04:25:44.028
SHOWER AT THE SAME TIME AND WHAT

04:25:44.094 --> 04:25:45.729
WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS WATER

04:25:45.796 --> 04:25:49.166
LOSS ACROSS THE THE AGENCY SO

04:25:49.233 --> 04:25:50.534
AND AND CONSERVATION ACROSS THE

04:25:50.601 --> 04:25:51.869
AGES IT WASN'T APPLIED TO THE

04:25:51.935 --> 04:25:52.536
INDIVIDUAL.

04:25:52.603 --> 04:25:54.838
BUT APPLY TRYING AS AN AGENCY TO

04:25:54.905 --> 04:25:55.639
MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE

04:25:55.706 --> 04:25:56.940
CONSERVING WATER IS CONSISTENT

04:25:57.007 --> 04:25:58.375
WITH THIS APPROACH.

04:25:58.442 --> 04:26:00.878
AND SO -- IT LOUD WATER AGENCIES

04:26:00.944 --> 04:26:02.112
TO MEET THEIR STANDARDS THAT

04:26:02.179 --> 04:26:04.081
ACCUMULATED APPROACH A WOMAN

04:26:04.148 --> 04:26:05.949
ACCUSED THIS MEASURE. TO UPHOLD

04:26:06.016 --> 04:26:07.084
THE SPIRIT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS

04:26:07.151 --> 04:26:08.218
FROM LAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT

04:26:08.285 --> 04:26:10.187
WATER SUPPLIERS ARE GIVEN THE

04:26:10.254 --> 04:26:11.955
FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED -- TO

04:26:12.022 --> 04:26:13.223
PRACTICALLY REACH THEIR

04:26:13.290 --> 04:26:14.858
EFFICIENCY GOALS IN THAT REGARD

04:26:14.925 --> 04:26:16.427
SPECIFICALLY THIS MEASURE.

04:26:16.493 --> 04:26:17.895
DETERMINES THAT THIS -- THE

04:26:17.961 --> 04:26:19.663
TERMS OF STATE WATER RESOURCES

04:26:19.730 --> 04:26:20.664
CONTROL BOARD WILL ENFORCE AND

04:26:20.731 --> 04:26:23.300
ACCUMULATED PERFORMANCE STANDARD.

04:26:23.367 --> 04:26:24.702
ENSURING THAT THE VOLUME AT

04:26:24.768 --> 04:26:26.170
VOLUME OF WATER LOSS IS NOT

04:26:26.236 --> 04:26:28.038
ENFORCED SEPARATELY FROM OTHER

04:26:28.105 --> 04:26:29.306
FACTORS NOW THERE IS.

04:26:29.373 --> 04:26:30.841
A OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS

04:26:30.908 --> 04:26:32.476
ALWAYS BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN BY

04:26:34.611 --> 04:26:36.280
WHICH IDENTIFIES A A A A A

04:26:36.347 --> 04:26:37.514
ATTENTION THAT EXIST WHERE

04:26:37.581 --> 04:26:39.249
THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THE

04:26:39.316 --> 04:26:39.917
PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE ROOM AND

04:26:39.983 --> 04:26:40.751
WHAT THEY MEANT.

04:26:40.818 --> 04:26:42.453
AND SO WE LOOK AT SOME OPTIONS

04:26:42.519 --> 04:26:45.489
OF BY YOUR COMMITTEE -- WHICH

04:26:45.556 --> 04:26:46.457
WE'LL TALK ABOUT HERE BUT I WANT

WATER CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF

04:26:54.865 --> 04:26:55.833
LIFE AND HOW DO WE MEET THOSE

04:26:55.899 --> 04:27:00.037
STANDARDS TO OFTEN ARE QUITE

04:27:00.104 --> 04:27:01.772
TICKLISH IN THE PROCESS.

PLUS MEMBERS SERVE ABOUT 70% OF

04:27:07.945 --> 04:27:08.912
THE WATER.

04:27:08.979 --> 04:27:10.247
IN CALIFORNIA I'M SENATE

04:27:10.314 --> 04:27:11.915
MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG DID A

04:27:11.982 --> 04:27:13.617
GREAT JOB EXPLAINING THE INTENT

04:27:13.684 --> 04:27:15.252
OF THE MEASURE BUT WE REALLY

04:27:15.319 --> 04:27:17.488
FEEL SO THIS APPROACH -- ALLOWS

04:27:17.554 --> 04:27:19.289
WATER SUPPLIERS OF FLEXIBILITY

04:27:19.356 --> 04:27:20.958
TO DECIDE ON ON WHAT AREAS ARE

04:27:21.024 --> 04:27:23.227
GOING TO FOCUS ON BASED ON

04:27:27.965 --> 04:27:29.233
THE COMPONENTS WATER LOSS IS

04:27:29.299 --> 04:27:31.068
BEING HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD

04:27:31.135 --> 04:27:32.403
AND IT IS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT

04:27:32.469 --> 04:27:34.138
OF THE LEGISLATION AGREE TO LAST

04:27:34.204 --> 04:27:35.205
YEAR.

04:27:35.272 --> 04:27:36.607
AS A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND.

04:27:36.673 --> 04:27:39.309

VOLUME OF WATER LOSS.

04:27:45.449 --> 04:27:46.884
WHEN THE STATE BOARD ADOPTS THE

04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:48.752
REGULATIONS THE VOLUMETRIC

04:27:48.819 --> 04:27:50.888
STANDARD WILL BE ENFORCEABLE THE

04:27:50.954 --> 04:27:52.489
STANDALONE TARGET?

04:27:52.556 --> 04:27:54.391
AND THIS IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER --

04:27:54.458 --> 04:27:56.393
PART OF THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE

04:27:56.460 --> 04:27:57.494
AND COULD SUBJECT WATER

04:27:57.561 --> 04:28:00.063
SUPPLIERS TO SIMULTANEOUS

04:28:00.130 --> 04:28:01.432
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

04:28:01.498 --> 04:28:02.933
I DON'T WANT TO BE CLEAR WATER

04:28:03.000 --> 04:28:04.435
AGENCIES ARE COMMITTED TO

04:28:04.501 --> 04:28:05.836

OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL SENSE

04:28:14.678 --> 04:28:16.713
TO DO SO -- WE BELIEVE THAT

04:28:16.780 --> 04:28:17.948
WATER LOSS IS A CRITICAL

04:28:18.015 --> 04:28:19.516
COMPONENT IN THE OBJECTIVE BUT

04:28:19.583 --> 04:28:20.918
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO HOLD

THAT ELEMENT TO A HIGHER

04:28:21.919 --> 04:28:23.120
STANDARD.

OBJECTIVE -- WE BELIEVE THAT ONE

04:28:35.466 --> 04:28:36.099
THIRTY FOUR IS A COMMON SENSE

MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS THAT

04:29:35.025 --> 04:29:36.994
FLEXIBILITY FOR EACH AGENCY TO

04:29:37.060 --> 04:29:38.962
DECIDE HOW.

04:29:39.029 --> 04:29:40.297
TO MEET THOSE CONSERVATION

04:29:40.364 --> 04:29:42.065
STANDARDS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

04:29:42.132 --> 04:29:42.666
US.

04:29:42.733 --> 04:29:44.067
EACH AGENCY IS VERY DIFFERENT WE

04:29:44.134 --> 04:29:46.036
REPRESENT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

04:29:46.103 --> 04:29:47.938
PLUS WATER AGENCIES -- AND SO

04:29:48.005 --> 04:29:49.406
THE WAY TO GO ABOUT MEETING THIS

04:29:49.473 --> 04:29:50.807
OBJECTIVE IS IS CAN BE VERY

04:29:50.874 --> 04:29:52.276
DIFFERENT ACROSS THE BOARD.

04:29:52.342 --> 04:29:53.810
IF I COULD JUST DRAW A QUICK

04:29:53.877 --> 04:29:55.812
COMPARISON -- TO THE R. P. S.

04:29:55.879 --> 04:29:58.181
PROGRAM IT WAS ESTABLISHED

04:29:58.248 --> 04:29:59.883
OBVIOUSLY BACK IN.

04:29:59.950 --> 04:30:00.484
TWO THOUSAND TWO YOUR PS IS

04:30:00.551 --> 04:30:02.019
MEANT TO REDUCE THE USE OF

04:30:02.085 --> 04:30:04.121
FOSSIL FUELS AND PROMOTE THE USE

04:30:04.187 --> 04:30:05.522
OF RENEWABLES.

04:30:05.589 --> 04:30:06.857
SIMILARLY THE KIND CONSERVATION

04:30:06.924 --> 04:30:08.725
BILLS PASSED LAST YEAR SEEK TO

04:30:08.792 --> 04:30:11.228
REDUCE WATER USE AND PROMOTE

04:30:11.295 --> 04:30:12.629
CONSERVATION.

04:30:12.696 --> 04:30:13.297
THERE ARE FEARS PROGRAM PROVIDES

04:30:13.363 --> 04:30:14.231
A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FOR

04:30:14.298 --> 04:30:15.899
UTILITIES TO PROCURE RENEWABLE

04:30:15.966 --> 04:30:17.701
ENERGY AND REDUCE THEIR RELIANCE

04:30:17.768 --> 04:30:19.870
ON FOSSIL FUELS IT DOESN'T SET A

04:30:19.937 --> 04:30:22.039
STANDARD FOR EACH TYPE OF ALSO

04:30:22.105 --> 04:30:22.940
FEEL.

04:30:23.006 --> 04:30:24.074
I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:30:24.141 --> 04:30:25.542
HERE IS SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE

04:30:25.609 --> 04:30:26.877
WE'RE SETTING A CONSERVATION

04:30:26.944 --> 04:30:28.979
STANDARD AND MAKING SURE THAT

04:30:29.046 --> 04:30:30.681
EACH AGENCY HAS THE ABILITY TO

04:30:30.747 --> 04:30:32.182
MEET THAT STANDARD IN A VARIETY

04:30:32.249 --> 04:30:33.917
OF WAYS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

04:30:33.984 --> 04:30:34.518
US.

04:30:34.585 --> 04:30:37.321
SO -- BY BY PRIORITIZING WATER

04:30:37.387 --> 04:30:38.722
LOSS OVER.

04:30:38.789 --> 04:30:40.757
OTHER WAYS TO MEET THAT STANDARD

04:30:40.824 --> 04:30:42.960
INDOOR OUTDOOR EFFICIENCIES.

04:30:43.026 --> 04:30:44.027
AND YOU'RE TAKING AWAY THAT

04:30:44.094 --> 04:30:45.495
FLEXIBILITY SO WHAT WE ARE

04:30:45.562 --> 04:30:46.997
ASKING FOR IS TO MAINTAIN THAT

04:30:47.064 --> 04:30:49.266
FLEXIBILITY THAT WE UNDERSTOOD

04:30:49.333 --> 04:30:52.135
WAS A PART OF THE LAW -- AND AND

04:30:52.202 --> 04:30:53.103
SO WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL

04:30:53.170 --> 04:30:55.739
TODAY.

04:30:55.806 --> 04:30:58.175
THANK YOU SIR OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

04:30:58.241 --> 04:30:58.742

MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT OF

04:30:59.409 --> 04:31:00.477
ORANGE CALIFORNIA.

04:31:00.544 --> 04:31:01.912
UP OR MODOC MODOC BECAUSE ONE OF

04:31:01.979 --> 04:31:03.180
THE FIRST WATER INDUSTRIES --

04:31:03.246 --> 04:31:05.816
AGENCIES TO GO UP IN SUPPORT OF

04:31:05.882 --> 04:31:06.617
SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT SIX OF SIX

04:31:06.683 --> 04:31:08.318
WAS EXTREMELY CONTROVERSIAL THE

04:31:08.385 --> 04:31:09.853
WAY WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

04:31:09.920 --> 04:31:11.121
COMFORTABLE WITH IT WAS SAYING.

CONVERSATIONS WHERE I WAS TOLD

04:31:26.536 --> 04:31:28.105
THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED IN QUORUM

COOK CLEAN UP LEGISLATION.

04:31:29.773 --> 04:31:31.174
OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW THAT CLEAN

04:31:31.241 --> 04:31:32.509
UP IS POSTING ON CONTROVERSIAL

04:31:32.576 --> 04:31:37.147
SO WE THANK SENATOR HERTZBERG

SOMETHING WHERE NOBODY EVER

04:32:32.002 --> 04:32:32.703
THOUGHT WE DID WITH WATER

04:32:32.769 --> 04:32:34.871
CONSERVATION AND THESE ARE

04:32:34.938 --> 04:32:36.606
CHALLENGING AND IF DIFFICULT

04:32:36.673 --> 04:32:37.841
THINGS BUT I HAVE TALKED TO

04:32:54.624 --> 04:32:56.660
PATHWAY FORWARD WITH THE

AMENDED.

04:33:32.028 --> 04:33:33.196
ENERGY SEE WAS ONE OF THE MOST

04:33:33.263 --> 04:33:35.298
ACTIVE SUPPORTERS OF THE TWENTY

04:33:35.365 --> 04:33:35.832
EIGHTEEN WATER EFFICIENCY

04:33:35.899 --> 04:33:37.200
LEGISLATION AND WORKED CLOSELY

04:33:37.267 --> 04:33:38.268
WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG

04:33:38.335 --> 04:33:39.836
ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AND THE

04:33:39.903 --> 04:33:43.206
STAKEHOLDERS -- WHERE THE ISSUE

04:33:43.273 --> 04:33:44.574
OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY DID COME UP

04:33:44.641 --> 04:33:45.809
DURING THAT DEBATE?

04:33:45.876 --> 04:33:47.110
ABOUT WE NEVER DISCUSSED

04:33:47.177 --> 04:33:48.245
REMOVING ENFORCEMENT FROM THE

04:33:48.311 --> 04:33:49.546
WATER LOSS STATUE THAT HAD

04:33:49.613 --> 04:33:51.481
PREVIOUSLY BEEN ADOPTE UNDER --

04:33:51.548 --> 04:33:53.917
SB FIVE FIVE FIVE IN TWENTY

04:33:53.984 --> 04:33:54.451
FIFTEEN IF THAT HAD BEEN

04:33:54.518 --> 04:33:56.219
PROPOSED I WE WOULD NOT HAVE

04:33:56.286 --> 04:33:57.587
BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR

04:33:57.654 --> 04:33:58.989
SUPPORT FOR THAT LEGISLATION.

04:33:59.055 --> 04:34:00.857
ENERGY SEE IS SYMPATHETIC TO THE

04:34:00.924 --> 04:34:02.459
POTENTIAL DOUBLE DOUBLE JEOPARDY

04:34:02.526 --> 04:34:03.827
ISSUE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A

04:34:03.894 --> 04:34:04.895
SOLUTION.

04:34:04.961 --> 04:34:06.963
BUT RESPECTFULLY AND VEHEMENTLY

04:34:07.030 --> 04:34:08.899
OPPOSE THE APPROACH TAKEN IN --

04:34:08.965 --> 04:34:11.334
THE CURRENTLY WRITTEN SB.

04:34:11.401 --> 04:34:12.235
ONE THIRTY FOUR WATER LOSS IS

04:34:12.302 --> 04:34:13.336
ONE OF THE CLEAREST FORMS OF

04:34:13.403 --> 04:34:14.604
WATER WASTE.

04:34:14.671 --> 04:34:16.139
IT'S WATER THAT IS A STRETCH

04:34:16.206 --> 04:34:17.641
EXTRACTED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT

04:34:17.707 --> 04:34:19.743
SOMETIMES PUMP HUNDREDS OF MILES

04:34:19.810 --> 04:34:20.577
TREATED TO DRINKING WATER

04:34:20.644 --> 04:34:22.579
STANDARDS AND THEN LOST THROUGH

04:34:22.646 --> 04:34:23.847
LEAKS AND PIPE BREAKS.

04:34:23.914 --> 04:34:26.049
OCCASIONALLY CAUSING EXTENSIVE

04:34:26.116 --> 04:34:28.285
AND EXPENSIVE DAMAGE TO PROPERTY

04:34:28.351 --> 04:34:30.020
AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

04:34:30.086 --> 04:34:31.721
RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET A WATER

04:34:31.788 --> 04:34:33.323
LOSS STANDARD IS ALSO COMPLETELY

04:34:33.390 --> 04:34:35.125
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE WATER

04:34:35.192 --> 04:34:37.127
UTILITY IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A

04:34:37.194 --> 04:34:38.962
PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS.

04:34:39.029 --> 04:34:40.130
IT'S UP TO THEM TO GO OUT AND

04:34:40.197 --> 04:34:41.698
AND MEET THAT STANDARD AND AND

04:34:41.765 --> 04:34:44.501
FIX THOSE LEAKS -- I THINK IT'S

04:34:44.568 --> 04:34:45.802
ALSO IMPORTANT MEMBER WHY WATER

04:34:45.869 --> 04:34:47.971
LOSS WAS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE

04:34:48.038 --> 04:34:49.906
WATER EFFICIENCY OBJECTIVE.

04:34:49.973 --> 04:34:51.842
PRIOR TO THE LEGISLATIVE PERIOD --

04:34:51.908 --> 04:34:53.109
WE ALL WORKED THERESTAKEHOLDER

04:34:53.176 --> 04:34:54.911
PROCESS WITH FIVE STATE AGENCIES

04:34:54.978 --> 04:34:56.379
TO DEVELOP THE MAKING WATER

04:34:56.446 --> 04:34:58.348
CONSERVATION A CALIFORNIA WAY OF

04:34:58.415 --> 04:34:59.516
LIFE FRAMEWORK.

04:34:59.583 --> 04:35:01.418
AND AT THAT TIME THIS OBJECTIVE

04:35:01.484 --> 04:35:03.453
WAS ENVISIONED TO INCLUDE ALL

04:35:03.520 --> 04:35:06.056
TYPES OF WATER DEMANDS -- SO

04:35:06.122 --> 04:35:08.124
WATER DEMANDS PLUS WATER LOSS

04:35:08.191 --> 04:35:09.793
EQUALS THE WATER THAT UTILITIES

04:35:09.860 --> 04:35:10.961
PUTTING IN THE SYSTEM.

04:35:11.027 --> 04:35:12.062
WHICH MADE THE FOR COMPLIANCE

04:35:12.128 --> 04:35:13.763
PURPOSES A WATER SUPPLIER COULD

04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:15.532
SIMPLY REPORT THE WATER THEY'RE

04:35:15.599 --> 04:35:16.633
PUTTING INTO THE SYSTEM IT WOULD

04:35:16.700 --> 04:35:18.268
REALLY JUST MAKE THE ACCOUNTING

04:35:18.335 --> 04:35:19.369
IMPORTING A LOT EASIER.

04:35:19.436 --> 04:35:21.204
AS IT BECAME LEGISLATION AND WE

04:35:21.271 --> 04:35:22.906
WORK TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

04:35:22.973 --> 04:35:24.040
SOME OF THOSE DEMANDS WERE

04:35:24.107 --> 04:35:25.008
STARTED STARTED TO BE PULLED

04:35:25.075 --> 04:35:26.309
FROM THE WATER OBJECTIVE SO

04:35:26.376 --> 04:35:28.445
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL INDOOR

04:35:28.511 --> 04:35:30.046
WATER USE WS PULLED OUT.

04:35:30.113 --> 04:35:31.047
IT MAKES A LOT LESS SENSE FOR

04:35:31.114 --> 04:35:32.549
THAT WATER LOSS TO BE IN THERE

04:35:32.616 --> 04:35:34.684
NOW SO AGAIN WATER LOSS WAS NOT

04:35:34.751 --> 04:35:36.019
INCLUDED TO PROVIDE EXTRA

04:35:36.086 --> 04:35:37.787
FLEXIBILITY IT WAS INCLUDED TO

04:35:37.854 --> 04:35:39.022
EASE REPORTING.

04:35:39.089 --> 04:35:41.992
NOW IT DOES IF YOU WE DO SUPPORT

04:35:42.058 --> 04:35:43.059
IF YOU ARE EXCEEDING YOUR WATER

04:35:43.126 --> 04:35:44.928
LOSS STANDARD BEING ABLE -- TO

04:35:44.995 --> 04:35:46.029
USE THAT TO HELP ME YOUR

04:35:46.096 --> 04:35:47.330
OBJECTIVE AND I THINK THAT

04:35:47.397 --> 04:35:48.031
THAT'S CAPTURED UNDER THE

04:35:48.098 --> 04:35:50.400
ALTERNATIVE NUMBER TWO THAT YOU

04:35:50.467 --> 04:35:53.069
SEE IN THE ANALYSIS -- THERE'S

04:35:53.136 --> 04:35:55.138
ALSO -- ANOTHER OPTION THEIR

04:35:55.205 --> 04:35:56.940
ALTERNATIVE THREE BOTH OF THOSE

04:35:57.007 --> 04:35:59.376
REMOVED DOUBLE JEOPARDY WITHOUT

04:35:59.442 --> 04:36:00.710
REMOVING THE ENFORCEMENT FROM

04:36:00.777 --> 04:36:02.879
THE WATER LOST OUT YOU.

04:36:02.946 --> 04:36:04.147
WE MET WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG

04:36:04.214 --> 04:36:05.715
THIS MORNING AND HE HAS AGREED

04:36:05.782 --> 04:36:07.083
TO WORK WITH US TO HOPEFULLY

04:36:07.150 --> 04:36:08.118
SETTLE ON AN ALTERNATIVE

04:36:08.184 --> 04:36:09.085
APPROACH THAT WOULD REMOVE OUR

04:36:09.152 --> 04:36:10.620
OPPOSITION.

04:36:10.687 --> 04:36:11.721
WE APPRECIATE THE SENATORS

04:36:11.788 --> 04:36:13.623
COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH US --

AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE

04:36:14.758 --> 04:36:15.792
CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL WE

04:36:15.859 --> 04:36:17.427
REMAIN IN OPPOSITION AND LESS IT

04:36:17.494 --> 04:36:18.795
IS AMENDED TO ADDRESS DOUBLE

04:36:18.862 --> 04:36:20.530
JEOPARDY WITHOUT REMOVING

04:36:20.597 --> 04:36:21.498
ENFORCEMENT THE WATER LAW

04:36:21.564 --> 04:36:23.233
STATUTE FOR THE WATER LOSS AT

04:36:23.300 --> 04:36:25.168
WATER LOSS STANDARDS FOR THE

04:36:25.235 --> 04:36:26.136

IS THERE SOME CLEVERNESS IN THIS

04:41:06.382 --> 04:41:06.916
