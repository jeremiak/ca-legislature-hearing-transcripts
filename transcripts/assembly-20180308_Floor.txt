DIVERSE CITY A PERSPECTIVES IS FUNDAMENTAL TO WHO WE ARE AS A STATE. AND THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES THE WIDE ARRAY OF RELIGIOUS FAITHS AND CREEDS PRACTICED BY ALL CALIFORNIANS. TODAY REPORTS OF ORGANIZATIONS LIKE REPORTS BY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ACLU AND CARE INDICATOR RISE IN HATE CRIMES AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST RELIGIOUS MINORITIES ACROSS THE NATION. IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER. WE MAKE CLEAR THAT WE RECOGNIZE CELEBRATE AND PROTECT OVER OUR RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY. INTERFAITH AWARENESS NOT ONLY CELEBRATES RESPECTIVE RELIGIONS. FAITHS AND CREEDS BUT ALSO THE BEAUTY IN THEIR CO EXISTENCE AND THE POWER AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CIVIL SERVICE THEY PERFORM. FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. FAITH LET ORGANIZATIONS. S. ME OF NUMEROUS PERSPECTIVES PROVIDE VITAL SERVICES AND OPERATE AS A STAPLE OF MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. EMPOWERING INDIVIDUALS TO REACH THEIR TRUE POTENTIAL.

THANK YOU MISTER BONTA. DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF OF AGE OF OF OF THIS RESOLUTION. THIS WEEK BECAUSE HR EIGHTY FIVE AND THE INTERFAITH AWARENESS WEEK. ON BEHALF OF THE CONGRESSIONAL OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BECAUSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. WE SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND IT'S INTERESTING IF WE THINK ABOUT IT OF ALL THE NATIONS IN THE WORLD. ALL THE NATIONS IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD BASICALLY CELEBRATE THIS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. BECAUSE WE'RE A NATION THAT'S FOUNDED ON THE CONCEPT OF RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY. WE'RE A NATION THAT CAME INTO EXISTENCE BECAUSE OF THE REPRESSION OF OTHERS WITH CONCERNING RELIGION. WE ACTUALLY HAVE IN OUR MOTTO THAT WE ARE A NATION UNDER GOD. THAT WE HAVE ON OUR MONEY IN GOD WE TRUST. AND SO WE HAVE BASICALLY PUT IN EVERY SYMBOL THAT WE HAVE THE IMPORTANCE OF GOT. THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION IN IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY OF THAT RELIGION. AND YET WE KNOW TOO OFTEN THAT IS THAT SAME WAY IN WHICH THAT RELIGION HAS BEEN A GUIDING FORCE AND A SUPPORT FOR DIVERSITY. IT HAS ALSO BEEN USED TO BASICALLY DIVIDE AND TO CONQUER AND TO DESTROY. NO WILL PROBABLY RECOGNIZES THAT MORE THAN AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO NOT ONLY WERE IN SLAVE IN THIS COUNTRY BY THE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT. BUT ALSO BY THE POWER OF THE RELIGION. THAT WHEN WE FOUGHT AGAINST SEGREGATION IN THE SOUTH IT WAS A REAL BASICALLY THE WHITE CITIZENS COUNCIL IN THE VARIOUS RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT FORMED AND SUPPORTED THE SEGREGATION. WHEN WE FOUGHT AGAINST THE IN OF FOR INTEGRATION OF SCHOOLS AND WAS SCHOOLS WERE SHUT DOWN IN ARKANSAS AND VIRGINIA FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. IT WAS RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ACTUALLY OPENED UP WHITE ONLY SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTH TO MAKE SURE THAT MY CHILDREN DID NOT YOU LOSE A YEAR OF EDUCATION. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RELIGION WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS A POWERFUL FORCE AND IT IS ALSO ALWAYS BEEN A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE LIFE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. WHO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE POWER OF RIGHT THEY COULD OVER ON THEY COULD OVERCOME AN ARMY OF EVIL? AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY USE THEIR RELIGION TO STRENGTHEN THEM AND TO PUSH FORWARD IN THE ISSUES THAT WERE MOST IMPORTANT. AND SO TODAY WE RECOGNIZE THE POWER OF RELIGION TO DO GOOD. BEGIN A FAITH THAT WE NEED TO BASICALLY LOOK AT IT AS OUR STRENGTH AND OUR SUPPORT. AND ALWAYS GUARD AGAINST THE ALSO THE POWER OF RELIGION TO DO EVIL.

THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY ACR ONE EIGHTY TWO. TODAY WE ARE COMMEMORATING THE WEEK OF MARCH FOURTH THROUGH MARCH TENTH AS WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION WEEK AND IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW HAS A TREMENDOUS NEED FOR SKILLED AND MOTIVATED WORKERS MANAGERS ENTREPRENEURS AND CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS OWNERS WOMEN EXCEL AT FILLING THAT NEED. AN APPRENTICESHIP IS A CRITICAL PATH WAY FOR WOMEN TO FULLY PARTICIPATE AND EQUALLY IN THE CALIFORNIA'S GROWING ECONOMY. RISING COSTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND INVOLVING EMPLOYER WORKFORCE TRAINING. THESE NEEDS MAKE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AND THE NUMBER OF WOMEN EMPLOYED IN THE U. S. CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY HAS GROWN BY EIGHTY THREE PERCENT. FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ALONE. AND FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO TWENTY TEN HOWEVER WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS SO SLOW WE LOST OVER TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CONSTRUCTION JOB MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA LEFT THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT OF THAT SLOWDOWN IN THE NUMBER BY TWENTY TEN WAS ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND WOMEN. AND ACCURATE ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS AND TWENTY SIXTEEN APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE WOMEN ARE BACK IN GETTING INTO THE OCCUPATIONS THAT ARE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. BUT WOMEN CURRENTLY OCCUPY ONLY TEN PERCENT OF APPRENTICESHIPS AND MAKE UP ONLY NINE PERCENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY NATIONWIDE. AS A STATE WE SHOULD SUPPORT EFFORTS FOR THERE TO BE MORE WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION THEY ARE GREAT AT IT. THE WORK FORCE IN CALIFORNIA IT NEEDS IT IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE. THAT CONSTRUCTION PATHWAYS TO YOUNG STUDENTS AND GIRLS IN SCHOOL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STEM. AND STEM JOBS AND GIRLS IN STEM REMEMBER THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IF YOU HAVE EVER OF A BIT VISITED.
