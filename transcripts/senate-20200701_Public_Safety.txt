SO I'M SENATOR NANCY SKINNER I'M CHAIR OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND AS I OPENED THIS IS A HEARING ON THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN IN OUR STATE PRISONS. SPREAD THAT IS THREATENING THE HEALTH AND WELFARE NOT ONLY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN HELD IN OUR PRISONS BUT ALSO THE STAFF. AND STAFF AND ALL CALIFORNIANS. A VIRUS KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES ITS RAPID SPREAD HAS NOW AFFECTED INFECTED. THE MINIMUM OF FIVE THOUSAND COURSE ROOTED IN VICTORY INDIVIDUALS WITH OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED IN SAN QUENTIN ALONE ALONG WITH HUNDREDS OF STAFF STAFF WHO DO NOT LIVE IN PRISON FACILITIES BUT GO HOME EVERY DAY. ACTUALLY SPREADING THE VIRUS TO FAMILY FRIENDS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. AS OF TODAY. THE REPORT THE DATA WE KNOW FROM CCAR IS TWENTY TWO INMATES HAVE DIED AS WELL AS TO MEMBERS OF THE STAFF. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING RECORD NUMBERS OF NEW CASES AND WE HAVE PULLED BACK ONE PLANNED OPENING OF BARS JAMS AND MORE. HOW MUCH OF THE INCREASE IN CASES IS RELATED TO THE UNCONTROLLED SPREAD IN OUR PRISONS WHICH WE KNOW IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITIES. OVER THE COURSE OF THIS MONTH LONG THIS IS THE GOVERNOR BUT WE ASSN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAVE HELD REGULAR NOON BRIEFING GUIDING ALL OF US ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL DISTANCING WEARING A SHORT COVERING STAND WATCHING IN THE NECESSITY TO DO WIDESPREAD TESTING. WHAT WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES NOW. IS WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS LISTENING. WAS CDC ARE MAINTAINING OR MANDATING THE SAME PUBLIC HEALTH PROTOCOLS THAT THE STATE ASKED OF THE REST OF US. OUR STATE PRISONS ARE LARGEST CONGREGATE SETTINGS. THE MAJOR OUTBREAKS AND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM NURSING HOMES TOLD US LOUD AND CLEAR. THEY CONGREGATE SETTINGS ARE INCUBATORS FOR A WILDFIRE LIKE SPREAD OF THIS FIRST. MY STAFF AND I'VE BEEN MONITORING THE OUTBREAK IN CDC OUR FACILITY SINCE LATE MARCH EARLY APRIL WE'VE BEEN IN WRITTEN AND VERBAL CONTACT WITH CITIES HERE ARE OFFICIALS THE ADMINISTRATION. THE LABOR REPRESENTATIVES OF CDC OUR STAFF AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND IN THE FIRST EIGHT WEEKS OR SOME OF THE OUTBREAK CITIES YOUR IN THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK NUMEROUS APPS TO LIMIT THE SPREAD. THE DISTRIBUTED MASKS PROVIDED HAND SANITIZER HAND WASHING STATIONS STOPPED VISITATION AN INTAKE COUNTY JAILS IN IN THOSE FIRST FEW. IT APPEARED PRESENCE OF THE VIRUS IN THE PRISONS WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS IT WAS IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. BUT AT SOME POINT THINGS WENT TERRIBLY WRONG THERE WAS A GROWING OUTBREAK INITIALLY AT CHINO. AND THEN AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION OF WOMEN CHUCKWALLA AVENUE. FOLLOWED BY THE- TRANSFER OF INMATES FROM CHINO TO SAN QUENTIN AND AS WE KNOW THERE IS NOW THE PRESENCE OF THE VIRUS IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR STATE PRISON FACILITIES. THE DECISION TO TRANSFER INCARCERATED PEOPLE FROM A PRISON WITH ONE OF THE WORST OUTBREAKS CHINO TO SAN QUENTIN WHICH AT THE POINT HAD NO KNOWN CASES. RAISES SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT CDC ARTS HANDLING OF THIS CRISIS THE NOW MAJOR OUTBREAK AT SAN QUENTIN THREATENS THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE ON STAFF THERE BUT ALSO BAY AREA HOSPITALS AND RESIDENTS. SUBSEQUENT TRANSFERS FROM SANDY. TO THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN SUSANVILLE SO THIS HAPPENED AFTER THE TRANSFER FROM CHINO. NOW HAS TO THAT FACILITY WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED CASES AND SUSAN BILL IS THE PIPELINE FOR OUR FIRE CAMPS AND WE ARE IN FIRE SEASON. THE TRANSFER OF ONE INCARCERATED PERSON TO THE SACRAMENTO PRISON FACILITY RESULTED IN A NURSE AND A STAFF THERE WHO PROCESS THAT INDIVIDUAL. TURNING CASTING NOW POSITIVE THESE IN THE ORIGINAL TRANSFER. RAISE LEGITIMATE CONCERN IN ANGER AT CDC OURS HANDLING OF THE PANDEMIC. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT CDC ARE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND OR SO PEOPLE THAT ARE HELD IN OUR STATE PRISONS SERVE ON AVERAGE JUST THREE POINT TWO YEARS THAT'S THEIR AVERAGE SENTENCE. NOW THOUSANDS OF THOSE ARE BEING HELD IN FEAR OF DEATH. IN FEAR OF PERMANENT MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS AN INJURY FROM COVERT NINETEEN AS WELL AS I MENTIONED THE THREAT OF SPREAD NOT ONLY THE THREAT WITH ME NO THE SPREAD IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THREE COURSE REPEAT AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE LEGITIMATELY AN EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM CD R. C. OUR STAFF AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE LEGITIMATELY AND CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE PLAIN FACT IS. THE VIRUS IS OUT OF CONTROL AT OUR STATE PRISON FACILITIES AND IT IS DEFINING EVERY CURVE WE POINT TO FOR PROGRESS. IN THE PLAIN FACT IS OUR PRISONS ARE STILL OVER CROWDED AND THERE ARE MANY HUNDREDS OF MEDICALLY VULNERABLE AND VERY ELDERLY INMATES WHO AS WE KNOW FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH DATA ARE MOST AT RISK OF DEATH FROM THE SPIRES.-THE ATTENTION AT LEAST MY INTENTION FOR TODAY'S HEARING. IS TO HEAR FROM THE SEED FROM CDC ARE INDEED MINISTRATION ON THE STATUS OF THE OUTBREAK. WHAT THEIR PLAN IS FOR CONTAINING THE VIRUS IN REDUCING DEATHS. AND FOR LIMITING COMMUNITY SPREAD. AND HEAR WHAT THE PLAN IS FOR IDENTIFYING AND ACCOUNTING EXCUSE ME FOR STAFF CONFECTIONS BECAUSE THE REPORTED NUMBERS SEEM VERY LOW. AND YOUR STAND THE TESTING PROCESS AND HOW REFUSALS FOR TESTS ARE BEING MANAGED. AND THEN TO HEAR FROM CDC OUR STAFF REPRESENTATIVES AND ADVOCATES WHO WERE IN COMMUNICATION. WITH INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS AN EXTERNAL MEDICAL TEAM THAT VISITED STANDPOINT SO THE TWO PANELS WILL HAVE. WELL ALL POLL INTRODUCED THE PANELS IN A MOMENT LET US JUST TURN SENATOR MORE LIKE DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO OPEN WITH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OR MEASURES USE ME- THERE WAS A RECENT TELEVISION NEWS- REPORT- SHOWING VIDEO OF. INMATES INTENTIONALLY SPREADING CODE NINETEEN- IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TODAY TO LEARN WHAT. WAS THEIR ASSUMPTION. EN ROUTE WHY ARE THEY DOING IT INTENTIONALLY- SO WHEN WE HEAR THE PANELISTS I'D LIKE TO. SEE WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I- ECHO YOUR CONCERNS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENING REMARKS. THANK IT'S THEIR BREAD. THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK THIS IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT HEARING AND- NOT ONLY FOR THE SAFETY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK AT THESE FACILITIES BUT THE INMATES THEMSELVES AND WE HAVE TO BE CRITICAL CLEAR THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED. HAVE NOT BROUGHT THIS DISEASE INTO THIS FACILITY. AND WHAT. WORK IN THIS FACILITY THE GOAL. ASUS WHO HAS BROUGHT THE SAN AND I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE TESTED ON A REGULAR BASIS TO NOT ONLY AS YOUR CHAIR WOMAN STATED MAKE SURE THAT THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE OURS ARE SAFE AND- AFFECTED BY THIS DISEASE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED WHO CANNOT BELIEVE THESE FACILITIES SO. I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING. ALSO FROM THE LEADERS HERE THIS SILLY OR WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK THERE ARE TESTED BEFORE THEY COME TO WORK ON A DAILY BASIS. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER. HI THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'M SURE I REALLY WANNA- THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING BUT ALSO ON YOUR CONSISTENTLY TO SHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND YOU HAVE BEEN DEEPLY PERSONAL AND KIDS. ON THIS SPECIFICALLY AROUND COVERED NINETEEN OF TO SEE OUR FOR MONTHS NOW AND ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND PUSHING- CDC ARE AND YOU HAVE BEEN ON THIS FROM THE BEGINNING AND FRANKLY. A LOT OF BY I WISH SO A LOT OF YOUR ADVOCACY HAVE BEEN CHEATED MORE OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS COULD WE PERHAPS COULD AVOIDED THIS FIASCO SAN QUENTIN. FOR A- FOR YOUR ROCKETS LEADER. ON I THINK LOOKING AT BIG PICTURE HERE TRAGICALLY. THE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING OVERSEEING AT SAN QUENTIN ELSEWHERE WITH THE SPREAD OF THIS CONTINUE TO. I SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ON THE LEADING CUTTING THIS ACCOUNTS INCARCERATION FOR DECADES- ON THE CUTTING EDGE IN A BAD WAY. THE STATE HAS PIONEERED MASS INCARCERATION GOING FROM E. STATE PRISONS IN THE SEVENTIES TO OVER THIRTY STATE PRISONS BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY. AND DESPITE THAT EXPLOSION AND NUMBER OF PRISONS AND THE COST TO OUR BUDGET. AND THE COST TO SO MANY COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TORN APART OUR PRISONS WERE STILL MAGICALLY OVERCROWDED AND SO DRAMATICALLY OVERCROWDED THAT THE YOU SUPPORT US WAS ON CON. FIVE AND SO IT NOT SHOCKING THAT WITH. THAT LEVEL OF MASSACRE. AND INTO PRISONS NOT SHOT. THAT A CONTAGION LIKE COVER NINETEEN WOULD SPREAD HI AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER REMINDER OF THE ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE TO REDUCE OUR PRISON POPULATIONS AND MOVE TOWARDS CARS SERRATION. IT IS. A MASS INCARCERATION. IF THE- HI DOES NOT MAKE US CITY FOR AS A STATE BUT A COSTS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT COULD BE GOING TO HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER NEEDS- AND IT TEARS APART COMMUNITIES IN THE HOUSE TO STOP IN THIS IS YET ANOTHER REMINDER TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY TOWARD THE CAR'S SERRATION IN A SHORT WE NEED REDUCE POPULATION. AND HEALTH TO. THIS DEMOCRATS IN ON OUR PER WHICH I THE CHAIR NOTES WILL NOT STATE A THE PRISON. WHATEVER HAPPENS IN OUR PRISONS AS A TENDENCY TO SAID I TESTED OUT SYSTEM PRISON. PRISONS ARE LINKED TO SOCIETY AND WHATEVER HAPPENS IN PRISONS WILL SPREAD OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND VICE VERSA. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING TODAY- TO SEE WHAT CDC ARE GOING RIGHT NOW. TO DRAW A CLEAR CHANGE ITS APPROACH PRONTO THING AROUND THE RELEASE BY MAKING SURE WE'RE TESTING PEOPLE AS THEY'RE BEING RELEASEDSO THAT WE ARE MONITORING THAT SITUATION. SO THAT WE CAN GET AHEAD ON US AND IT RELATED ISSUE THAT I WILL BE RAISING. I THINK IS INCREDIBLY POOR AND- THAT IS WHY IS CITIES PRK CONTINUING TO TRANSFER. KEEP FROM ITS CUSTODY TO ICE. BECAUSE WHEN WE TROUT THE ICE SEND PEOPLE WHO MAY BE MATTER MONO THEMSELVES. TO PRIVATE PRISON ICE DETENTION FACILITIES THERE OVERWHELMINGLY RUN BY PRIVATE ENTITIES- WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT ONE IN THREE OF THE DETAINEES AND THOSE EYES FACILITIES. IT IS COVERED POSITIVE THESE ARE COVERED HOT SPOTS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT IT IS EITHER UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DEAL WITH PANDEMIC. AND THAT IS ON WILLING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF IMMIGRANTS AND WE NEED TO STOP TRANSFER. CUSTODY OF OUR STAY PRISONS TO ICE DETENTION FACILITIES AND NEEDS TO AND IMMEDIATELY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR FIRST OF ALL LET ME ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES IN THANKING YOU FOR YOUR STEADFAST. MOM FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE- AND CLEARLY THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IN TERMS OF. NOT ONLY APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT BUT JUST ON MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE FULLY AWARE. STATEMENTS ARE FULLY AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU KNOW MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO ON AS A RESULT OF PLOT A VERSUS FOR TODAY OR THE FEDERAL COURT DETERMINE THAT CDC ARE HAS FAILED TO MEET THE BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL. RIGHTS OF INMATES WITH REGARD TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO FAST FOR DATA TWENTY TWENTY AND WE'RE STILL UNDER THE RESULTING RECEIVERSHIP. BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T STRUCTURALLY FIX THE PROBLEM DEAR TO MANY PEOPLE INTO CONFINED SPACE WITH TOO FEW RESOURCES. AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY WERE UNFORTUNATELY NONE OF US ARE SURPRISED. THE COOL BUT NINETEEN HAS FOUND ITS WAY DEEP INTO OUR PRISON SYSTEM. AND IN MY OPINION THE SITUATION CURRENTLY OF FAN QUICKNESS CLEARLY JUST THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. WE WILL SEE IN LESS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAPPEN. PRISON AFTER PRISON AFTER PRISON WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE ARE THOUSAND CASES IT SEE I AM IN CHINO. AND SO THIS IS ON FORCING JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG UNLESS DRASTIC CHANGE HAPPENS. MANY OBSERVERS HAD NOTED SOME CONCERNING PRACTICES IN THE SYSTEM THE CONFLICT WITH ADVICE FROM THE WHL THE CITY. COUNTY HEALTH DIRECTOR STATEWIDE. THIS IS LIKE THE TRANSFERS INITIATIVE BEEN SHELTERING LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILY AND LOVED ONES AND THE DISCONTINUATION OF PROGRAMMING. IN OTHER INSTANCES MAYBE GIVE GET GUIDELINES ARE BEING FOLLOWED AS IT'S BEEN ASSERTED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND YET THE DISEASE CONTINUES TO SPREAD. CLEARLY SOMETHING IS AMISS. I TOO AM EAGER TO HEAR TODAY WHAT THE PLAN OF ACTION IS FROM THIS POINT GOING FORWARD. AS CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE I AM KEENLY AWARE OF THE NEEDS AND REQUESTS THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE USING THAT LANDS IN TODAY'S HEARING I LOOK FOR T. PARTICIPATED IN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENIENT IF THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S. YES THANK YOU OF. MADAM CHAIR AND ALSO I SHARE THE SAME DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE LACK OF- OVERSIGHT THE LACK OF. CARING AND COMPASSION THAT SEEMS TO EXIST IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO. OUR THE PRISONERS THERE ARE WITH RESPECT TO THEIR HEALTHCARE. AS JUST NOTED BY MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES. LOOKING AT THE ISSUE WHETHER IT WAS WOMEN CONTINUING TO BE STERILIZED IN PRISON. WHETHER IT'S THE LACK OF CONCERN FOR TRUE REHABILITATION- OUR PRISON SYSTEM FRANKLY I THINK HAS FAILED US AND IN NO GREATER RESPECT THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW WITH THIS COVERT SITUATION. I HAVE A FEDERAL PRISON IN MY DISTRICT THE LONG POKE FEDERAL PENITENTIARY WHICH WAS PRIOR TO SAN QUENTIN. OF THE PLACE WITH THE GREATEST INCREASE AND SURGING OF COVERT NINETEEN CASES- THE ABOUT THE INABILITY TO GET INFORMATION. TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THESE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE OF COURSE THE FEDERAL SO THEY REALLY DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT WHAT THE STATE HAS TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING. BUT NONE THE LESS WE SEE THE SAME KIND OF LACK OF REGARD- IN OUR OWN CD SHE OUR SYSTEM WHEN IT COMES TO HOW WE TREAT THESE CENTERS. AND HOW WE ADDRESS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS PROBLEM. ARE THERE PEOPLE IN PRISON WHO SOME MIGHT CAN TO BE. LESS THAN THE REST OF US THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE OVER WHOM WE ALL OF RESPONSIBILITY THEY ARE INCARCERATED. THEY HAVE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR FREEDOM- AND SO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR THEM AS HUMAN BEINGS. AND WE'RE NOT DOING THAT SO I WILL BE VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENS TODAY AS WELL. I AM VERY FRUSTRATED WITH OUR FEDERAL SYSTEM. WHICH AGAIN DOES NOT THINK THAT THEY HAVE ANY ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND YET MANY OF THOSE GUARDS IN THE STAFF AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE. HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS CONDITION AND BROUGHT IT BACK INTO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY- I THINK THAT THAT IS PART OF THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE SEEING- BUT THE- THE FACT THAT THERE HAS BEEN A COMPLETE AND UTTER DISREGARD OF FOR THESE. THE INMATES AS HUMAN BEINGS AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE A SOCIETY TO KEEP PEOPLE AT LEAST THE VERY BASIC LEVEL OF HUMAN DIGNITY. I HAS REALLY LED TO THIS PROBLEM TODAY AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT OUT OF ADVERSITY. COMES OPPORTUNITY OR AS THEY SAY OUT OF WOMEN SHE TRIED TO MAKE LEMONADE THAT WE CAN REALLY START MOVING AND FINANCING ARE MORE CARING A MORE CHARGED UP IN FAIRVIEW. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE AN CARP TO THOSE WHO FOR WHATEVER DESERVE A TO BE ISOLATED FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE ISOLATED FROM HUMANITY AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT I HOPE WE CAN ADDRESS SIR STARTED PRESSING TODAY DIMENSION. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON FROM THERE IN TO MEMBERS ALSO ONE TO MAKE SOME. COM ON. TURN TO THE IMAGES ONE MOMENT BUT I AM INDICATING IT'S NINE TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE- OUR FIRST PANEL INCLUDES TO- REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHO I UNDERSTAND HAVE A HARD STOP AT TEN. SO SINCE I KNOW MANY OF US WILL HAVE QUITE AN ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE THAT PANEL ADEQUATE TIME SO NOW I WILL TURN TO SENATOR MCGUIRE FOLLOWED BY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- LEVINE AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. MINIATURE THANK YOU WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO OFFER MY APPRECIATION MADAM CHAIR TO YOU AND YOUR TEAM- FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE A PARTICIPATE TO DAY- AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO. CENTER SKINNER HAS BEEN LEADING FROM THE FRONT ON THIS ISSUE. BEFORE EIGHT HIT THE HEADLINES SHE HAS BEEN SOUNDING THE ALARM. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP MADAM CHAIR AND AGAIN I TRULY APPRECIATE. BEING HERE TODAY. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THIS TO SAY THANK YOU TO SECTOR IDEAS HE'S BEEN RESPONSIVE- TO THE NEEDS AND WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY OBVIOUSLY- I DON'T TAKE LIGHTLY. AND I AM NOT ONE. TO TYPICALLY GO AFTER STATE. AGENCIES BUT HERE'S MY CHALLENGE. REPRESENT THAT AREA WHERE- TEN CLINTON IS AT. AND I'M GONNA EASE A PHRASE THAT CAME FROM AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST IN MARIN COUNTY TODAY. THE CONDITIONS IN ST CLINTON THIS MORNING. HAVE UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM. UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM IF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS. CONTINUE IN THE DAYS TO COME. AND AGAIN I DON'T. SAID A SLIGHTLY BUT THIS IS A FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP. THIS CRISIS IS COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE. THE BASIC THE BASIC PROACTIVE ACTIONS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN INITIATED BACK IN EARLY JUNE SIMPLY NEVER HAPPEN TO THE LEVEL WHERE SUCCESS COULD BE G. THE A HUNDRED TWENTY TO HUNDRED AND THIRTY. PRISONERS TRANSFERRED FROM CHINO SHOULD EVER HAPPEN IN SUCH AN OLD FACILITY WHERE THERE WERE NO SOLID DOORS. NO SOLID DOORS AND THEN THE VIRUS SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE. THERE IS NO PROACTIVE MEASURES WE ARE LEADING BEHIND THE- THERE'S STAFFING SHORTAGES LACK OF CLEANING PROTOCOLS. NOT ENOUGH SECURITY NOW AND HOSPITALS. LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES IN BOTH THE COUNTY MARIN COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO. PHYSICIANS ARE NOW SPENDING. HOURS UPON HOURS TO FIND HOSPITAL BEDS TO TRANSFER INMATES OUT TO. THERE IS INSUFFICIENT CUSTODY COULD STAFFING. AND TONIGHT WE'LL HAVE OUR FOLLOW AT THAT MEETING WITH WE'LL CALL IT ALL HANDS ON DECK MEETING BETWEEN. THE LEGISLATURE CDC ARE. SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC HEALTH MARIN PUBLIC HEALTH ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. WE NEED TO DEVELOP A UNIFIED INCIDENT COMMAND ON SITE BOTTOM LINE ALL AGENCIES INVOLVED ARE HEARING THE SAME THING ALL AT ONCE WE NEED TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO CREATE SEARCH CAPACITY FOR I SEE YOU IN HOSPITAL BEDS IN THE GREATER BAY AREA. AS OF TEN PM LAST NIGHT TWENTY FOUR OUT OF TWENTY FIVE I SEE BEDS IN MARIN ARE FULL EIGHT ARE SAN QUENTIN INMATES. WE NEED TO CREATE. EMS PROTOCOLS FOR PATIENT TRANSFERS SO THAT WE'RE NOT FLOODING ONE AREA OF THE BAY. BUT THERE IS A STRATEGY TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFER. THERE IS GOING TO NEED TO BE SOME TYPE OF ON SITE MEDICAL FACILITY. ESTABLISHED WE NEED TO DISCUSS WHAT THAT STRATEGIES FOR PLANNED EARLY RELEASE IN WHERE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL POTENTIALLY BE QUARANTINE. AND THERE HAS TO BE A LONG TERM DECISION ON ADDITIONAL TRANSFERS INTO THE FACILITY. MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR LOVING COMMENTS AND TRULY.

WE DO NOT KNOW THE EXTENT OF THIS VIRUS NOW IN ALL THE REST THE FACILITIES EXCEPT WHAT IS REPORTED WE KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WE KNOW THAT ALL GUARDS OF NOT. TO STAFF I SHOULD SAY STAFF HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED SO I THINK THAT. WHILE YOU OF OUTLINED A PLAN FOR ONE FACILITY. THIS MUST BE A PLAN FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE.

THERE ARE SIXTEEN OF OUR INSTITUTE THAT EVERY CALM FREE TODAY THIS RISING QUE ANSWER COMMUNITIES WITH THE ADDITIONAL EIGHT REPORTING ONLY SINGLE DIGIT NUMBERS. WE HAVE THE OUTBREAK TO SEVER OTHER INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON AT LANCASTER. AND THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN THIS POSITIVE PROGRESS HIGHLIGHTS YOU SEE OUR AND THE RECEIVERS OFFICES ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE EFFORTS. THE MASS TESTING IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIRST COVER NINETEEN. CASE WAS GOING. AS HELP-MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. SEE SEE ON THE RECEIVER'S OFFICE WE ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO FIGHT OVER THAT ALL INSTITUTIONS WE ARE PART OF THIS COMMUNITY. WE EACH STEP IN AND WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR PLACE TO FURTHER IN THE CALL TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH ALL WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO HUESO PROVE OUR EFFORTS IN EVERY SINGLE WAY POSSIBLE. WHICH INCLUDES AND PROTECTION FOR CONTINUED PRODUCTIVE COLLABORATION WILL EVALUATE STAKEHOLDERS. NOW I WILL SAY I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW ONE THING THAT I DID HERE. WAS THE LACK OF CARE THERE'S A THOUGHT THAT. I'M GONNA QUESTIONS OR MYSELF DO NOT CARE ABOUT POPULATION OR WE VIEW THEM AS SUBHUMAN OR THEY DON'T DESERVE THE SAME TYPES OF CONSIDERATIONS AS ALL OF US ARE ALL OF US YOU SEE RIGHT HERE. I SAY THAT. INSOFAR AS THE TRUTH WE HAVE MORE TIRELESSLY TO CHANGE THE CULTURE INSTITUTIONS WE HAVE DEDICATED STAFF MEMBERS RETURNING TO WORK TO THE TUNE RIGHT NOW THREE HUNDRED AND STAFF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY STAFF MEMBERS HAVE RETURNED TO WORK. TO DO THE WORK OF ASSISTING IN MITIGATING AND HELPING OUT IN REDUCING THE SCOPE IT. SO THE THOUGHT THAT WE DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE PERSONALLY. ALL THIS FROM THE TRUTH. WE CARE ABOUT THE INMATES WE CARE ABOUT THE STAFF COULD WE HAVE DONE BETTER IN MANY INSTANCES AND I CAN ANSWER SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS OF COURSE WE CAN. WE'RE FOUR MONTHS INTO A PANDEMIC FOUR MONTHS IN A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC THAT WE ARE WE ARE LEANING AND LEADING INTO ANY RESOURCES ALL SMALL THE RECEIVERS OFFICES CDC ARE EVAN WORKING ARM IN ARM TO TRY AND MITIGATE AT ALL INSTITUTIONS NOT JUST. NOT RIGHT OUTSIDE OUR- WITH THE WITH THAT TO A MADAM SO. TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD ON TO QUESTIONS TO YOU IN HERE FROM DOCTOR GOLLY BECAUSE I'VE JUST LEARNED THAT HE HAS JOINED US SO IF I COULD TURN TO DR GOLLY WHO'S THE SECRETARY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HER HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND WHO'S BEEN DIRECTING CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO THE ENDEMIC TACTICAL. IS A NOT AVAILABLE. SAID DR ALL YOU NEED TO ON YOU YOURSELF IN. WE CAN'T HEAR YOU YOU NEED TO BE ON MUTED OKAY ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR YEAH NOW WE CAN'T YES GOING GLOBAL THANK YOU. WOMEN THANK YOU. HAVE MANY- I HAVE LIMITED TIME BUT I AM. RICHARD OF HAVING A CHANCE TO JOIN THIS HEARING THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING ON WHAT I THINK IS AN ESSENTIAL AND IMPORTANT ISSUE ACROSS OUR STATE- I WANT TO THANK SECRETARY DEALS FOR ITS PARTNERSHIP OVER THE LAST MANY MONTHS- THEIR THAT. REALLY BEGAN TO BACK IN MARCH AS WE BEGAN TO SEE THE- THE RAT WITHIN OUR PRISON SYSTEM JUST AS WE- THROUGH- HHS ARE COMPARTMENTS EARLY. E. PH AS WELL AS OUR I AM SO. TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH- CDC ARE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE PROTOCOLS. AND THE- PLANS AROUND INFECTION CONTROL AND TESTING ARE ROLLED OUT. I WANT TO BEGIN BY- ALSO STREAM BAD TODAY OUR FOCUS IS ON THE ISSUES AT SAN QUENTIN MOVING FORWARD ENSURING THAT IT AS WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT TO SECRETARY DO ES AND THE RECEIVER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TEAMS AT THE FACILITY AND BEYOND. BAD WE LOOK FORWARD TO INSTITUTING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I SECRETARY DHEAS IN TERMS OF INFECTION CONTROL IN TERMS OF THE INCIDENT COMMANDER. IN TERMS OF MODELING WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE NOT JUST INSANE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. BUT IN OTHER CDC&lt;/c&gt;</u> ARE PRISCILLA NEEDS. ENSURING THAT. BEEN SUPPLIED AND PROCESS SEES AN LABS ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE FURTHER DELAYS IN TESTING THAT COULD BE DONE ENSURING THAT ASSETS SUCH AS STAFF HANDS FOR ON SITE ON PROPERTY ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN DO FOR CRIME RATE AND- THANKS. SURE THAT. THIS IS BOTH IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES AND AT THE LARGEST JAIL SYSTEM IN THE NATION- THIS COMES FROM A NUMBER OF YEARS OF EXPERIENCE RUNNING THOSE JAIL FACILITIES- AND THEIR MAP ARE THE MEDICAL SERVICES THERE SAID IT IN A PANDEMIC OR IN ANY OPERATE THE FIRST ISSUE IS TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO ARE SICK. THIS IS NOT. AND AMONG THOSE WHO ARE NOT SICK WE MUST KNOW WHO ARE INFECTED AND WE'RE NOT THAT EFFECTIVELY COAL OR DAM IN DISTINCT AREAS. SERVED BY BOOSTING STAFF AND LIMITING MOVEMENT AND MAKE SEEN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE IF WE HAVEN'T YOU CONTROL THE ENTRY OF THE VIRUS OR THE INFECTION THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR THE JOB NUMBER ONE IS TO MAKE SURE. CONTAINMENT HAPPENS IN THE FACILITY IN A SUCCESSFUL WAY. ONCE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THE STATE AND- INFECTION CONTROL PROCEDURES FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT SAID IT'S IMPORTANT TO MONITOR THOSE WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE INFECTED YEAH I'M NOT CERTAIN. AND THEN ALSO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO CAST AND- TRACK THOSE WHO ARE NOT YET INSPECTED TO ENSURE THAT IF THEY DO BECOME INFECTED WE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. FOR THOSE WHO ARE SICK WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO NEED A CUTE HIGH LEVEL CARE ARE TRANSFERRED SAFELY AND IMMEDIATELY TO OUTSIDE FACILITIES TO RECEIVE THAT LEVEL OF CARE. THINK THE PLANS THAT ARE IN PLACE MOVING FORWARD TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL SYSTEM THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS NOT JUST IN MARIN AND SAN FRANCISCO BUT ALSO IN OTHER COUNTIES ACROSS THE BAY. WHERE HOSPITALS MAY BE ACCEPTING PATIENTS TO WORK THROUGH THE REGIONAL COORDINATING SYSTEM AT OUR ANSWER SYSTEM LED BY DR DAVE DUNCAN. HE HIMSELF HAS HELPED MANAGE THE TRANSFER OF PATIENTS AND IMPERIAL COUNTY TO VARIOUS OUTLINED HOW TO COUNTY FACILITIES THE SAME HANNAH AND I KNOW IS PLANNED TO BE DONE NOW IN THE SAME CUENTA QUE. THIS REQUIRES CLOSE CONNECTION WITH DOCTOR WILLIS AND HIS TEAM AT THE MARIN PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND IN PARTICULAR CLOSE WORK WITH MARIN GENERAL HOSPITAL AND ENSURING THAT THAT HOSPITAL HAS CAPABILITY NOT JUST THE SERVER. THINK QUENTIN PATIENTS BUT AS ASSEMBLY MAN PAUL LEVINE MENTIONED ENSURING THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE CAPACITY. FOR THE MARINE COMMUNITY AS WELL. FURTHERMORE PART OF WHAT THE SECRETARY MENTION. CLOSE AND CONNECTED WORK WITH DIRECTOR GIL DUTY ACT HELLO YEAH THAT'S ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING ADDITIONAL SPACE TO TREATMENT CAPABILITY AND SPACE TO SAN QUENTIN TO ENSURE THOSE WHO ARE SHOWING FORMERLY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OR MODERATE TO MILD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS. CAN BE ADEQUATELY CARED FOR ON THE FACILITY WITH STRONG MEDICAL PERSONNEL DIRECTOR QUIT MEANS AND MEDICINES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THEY CAN AVOID GOING TO THE OUTSIDE FACILITIES. THAT WERE ABLE TO DO THAT IN A SAFE AND MEANINGFUL WAY THAT IF CHORUS IN SURE IS THAT THOSE WHO NEED A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES BOTH WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM AND IN THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION THE RULES AND LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED FROM PRIOR OUTBREAKS IN PRISONS IN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS- HOLD TRUE TODAY IN THIS SETTING AND I JUST WANT UNDER SCHOOL OR BEFORE I TURN IT BACK TO YOU CHAIRWOMAN WHAT YOU SAID THIS IS NOT JUST A SAN QUENTIN ISSUE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO LEARN THE LESSONS AND THIS OF ALL BEING PANDEMIC AND ENSURE THAT WE NOT ONLY TAKE THOSE INTO ACCOUNT AT SAN QUENTIN BUT ALL OF THIS ALREADY AND MY ENTIRE AGENCY AND OUR DEPARTMENTS CONTINUOUS READY THE SERVER. PARTNER WITH SECRETARY VIA AS AN OLD THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT WE PUT OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD. FOR A VERY VULNERABLE POPULOUS. THANK YOU SECRETARY KELLY- COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS SINCE HE HAS LIMITED TIME AND MUST LEAVE AT TEN. I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT SOME QUESTIONS IN BEFORE RETURNED OTHER PANELISTS BEFORE WE DIRECTOR QUESTIONS TO- THE REST THE PANELISTS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH ONE. TE DOCTOR GOLLY IN THE NOON BRIEFINGS WITH THE GOVERNOR YOU ENTER THE GOVERNOR HAVE POINTED MANY TIMES TO OCCUR. CAN YOU USE THAT CURVE TO GO TO GUIDE THE REST OF US IN RELATIONSHIP TO- HOW TO FIND THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WAS SUCH CURVE ANALYSIS DONE FOR CDC OUR FACILITIES. AND IF AND IF IT HASN'T BEEN IF IT WASN'T IN THE PAST ARE YOU DOING ONE NOW. IT HAS IT HAS NOT BEEN DONE AND IMPLORED AID- MANY OF THOSE MODELS AND CURBS REQUIRE US TO HAVE ACCURATE MASON ABOUT THE LEVEL OF IN FACT TO SPREAD. WHAT WE TALK ABOUT IS THE ARE A FACTOR AND WE CAN CERTAINLY CREATE THAT AND HAVE AT LEAST INTERNAL CONVERSATIONS AROUND HOW TO CREATE THAT NOT JUST SYSTEM WIDE BUT IT WOULD BE NEEDED TO WORK HER ACROSS ANY FACILITY AND WHAT IT WOULD REQUIRE US TO DO. IS BOTH UNDERSTAND THE LEVEL OF- SORT OF- HOW CLOSE IN MAKES ARE TO ONE ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY THE LEVEL OF SO PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND PHYSICAL DISTANCE SEEN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS GOING. DESIGNING CURVES IT IS JACK CREATED FOR LARGE COMMUNITY IS WHERE THERE IS GENERAL FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND MIXING- AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE NON PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING INCLUDING BASED COVERINGS. AND NINETY FIVES AND OTHERP. B. AS WELL AS PHYSICAL DISTANCING I THINK THE IMPORTANT ISSUE TIME NOW THAT AS A FIVE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFORTS IS MAKING SURE THAT OUR COLLABORATIVE PLAN FOR TESTING AND SECRETARY DHEAS I KNOW IS WORKING HARD ALONG WITH OUR OUR TEAMS. TO ENSURE THAT THAT TESTING IS AVAILABLE TO STOP THE RECEIVER TO MAKING SURE THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL INMATES WILL BE EXACTLY THE TYPE OF INFORMATION AND THAT TEST POSITIVITY REPEAT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD THOSE MODELS FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU DOCTOR. I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH I'D DO NOT FEEL THAT TO SATISFACTORY ANSWER IN THAT. THIS IS A- POPULATION THAT'S IN CUSTODY AND THE PEOPLE THAT DO WITH THEM OR STAFF OF THE STATE SO AND THIS IS A POPULATION THAT WE CONTROL. THE TEMPO THE STAFF IN IT AND THE PEOPLE IN SO. IF YOU WERE IN THE TESTING COULD HAVE BEEN DONE THE- IN COULD HAVE BEEN MANDATED THE WEARING OF MASKS COULD HAVE BEEN MANDATED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT. THAT ARE COUNTIES ARE TELLING THE REST OF US THIS IS EIGHT EIGHTY. AN ENTITY THAT IS EVEN MORE. CONDUCIVE TO SUCH THINGS JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE CONTROL WE HAVE OVER THE INDIVIDUALS- SO IT'S- I DON'T FEEL VERY SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER AND I WOULD SAY THAT TO BOTH CDC ARE IN THE ADMINISTRATION. BY STARTED RAISING THE QUESTION OF TESTING BACK IN EARLY APRIL AND I KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO PASS BUT AS WE WATCH THE OUTBREAK IN NURSING HOMES AND WE KNEW THAT AND WE BEGAN TO NOTICE NOT NOTICE BUT LEARN THE- SPREAD BY PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT SYMPTOMATIC. THIS TESTING REALLY REALLY WHAT'S NECESSARY IN THIS LARGEST CONCORD FACILITY AND APOLOGIES I SHOULD STOP EXPRESSING FRUSTRATION AND LET AMONG EIGHT. MEMBERS SO AT QUICK. SENATOR MORAL SENATOR MAY I JUST- YES I MEANT FOR ONE BRIEF COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO SEPARATE OUT THE ANSWER AROUND THE MODELING OKAY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD AND CAN BE DONE AND EVER. BILL IN ALL OF THE AND- MEN'S I THINK I REALLY DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE- THE PLAN AROUND TESTING AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND TESTING OR ONES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING ON INSURING THAT THOSE- THOSE TESTS YEAH DON SCALE AND SECRETARY DE HAS MENTIONED- A SECURE IN NUMBER OF TASKS. THAT ENOUGH IS THERE MORE TO DO ABSOLUTELY I AM THE FIRST TO SAY THAT THE GLOBAL TESTING CHALLENGE IN CALIFORNIA. WAS ARE YOU KNOW REALLY MULTIPLE FACTORS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I TAKE THEM WE TAKE A SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO STARTING NOW WITH NOT ENOUGH TESTING NOT JUST IN OUR CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS OF THOSE THAT ARE RUN BY THE STATE BUT- WHY. AND TODAY. WE REALLY REYES STOP START FROM JUST DAY BACK IN APRIL TWO TODAY- ACHIEVED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND TESTS ON SOME DAYS. THINGS TO ME AND THAT'S IT ALL OF YOU IS TESTING IS. AND MANY OF OUR FACILITIES AND ITS RAMPING UP SO THAT SHOULD BECOME SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS US MORE INTELLIGENCE INTO THE SITUATIONS IN THE FACILITIES ALLOWS US TO PLAN BETTER THERE IS NO DISPUTE BUT MORE COULD BE AND SHOULD BE DONE. SO I WOULD HESITATE TO LEAVE THE COMMITTEE WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT I OR ANY OF US BELIEVE THAT THE- RESPONSE HAS BEEN SATISFACTORY AND THAT MORE SHOULD AND CAN BE. THANK YOU CENTER MORE BLACK THANK THANK YOU MAY TURN THANK YOU DOCTOR GOLLY FOR- DEALING WITH THIS CRISIS MANAGEMENT- SITUATION. WE'RE DEALING WITH CONSTITUENTS AND THEY APPEAR TO WILL- PERCEIVE AND THEY'RE OBSERVING. THAT WERE NEGLECTING NURSING HOMES IN PRISONS. AND ALL THEY SEE IS BEING TOLD THE CLOSE BEACHES AND RENTAL HAS SAID ARE USED SO WE'RE- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COMMUNICATE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND HOW CAN I BEST TELL THEM HOW YOU SELECT PRIORITIES. DOCTOR GROWING YOUR MUTED AGAIN. WE STILL CAN'T HEAR YOU. OKAY NOW I ARE YOU HERE ON ME TO GO AHEAD CAN YOU HEAR US NOW YES YES SEEMS LIKE EACH TIME WE HAVE TO ON MUTE SO YEAH RIGHT TO BE QUICKER DOING THAT- I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND THE ISSUING CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES IS- CLEARLY THE FRONT DOOR BY IS WHERE THE INFECTION COMES AND- AND BASED ON THE LEVEL OF MAKE SCENE BETWEEN STAFF AND RESIDENTS WHETHER THOSE ARE IN MAY TO RESIDENTS IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. WE BEGIN TO SEE A VERY RAPID SPREAD RATE SO OUR NUMBER ONE STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE THAT IN ANY CONGREGATE CARE FACILITY THAT WE PREVENT INFECTION COME COMING IN THE FRONT DOOR I WILL SAY SENATOR MORE LIKE THAT WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF SUCCESS STORIES WITHIN AND SOME OF THE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES WHERE AND WE MIGHT EVEN AT A LARGER RATE. IN THAT SETTING BUT HAVE BEAT THROUGH SOME VERY FULL TRIED AND TRUE FRANKLY INFECTION CONTROL STRATEGIES AND ABLE TO SEPARATE STAFF. EIGHT RESIDENTS ARE IN MAY. AND ALLOW YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCE. IN TERMS OF ILLNESS IN DOUBT- THE OUTBREAK TO SETTLE DOWN AND THEN INSTITUTE. SERIAL TESTING AND SURVEILLANCE TESTING TO PROTECT FURTHER OUTBREAKS WE'VE DONE THOUGH IN A NUMBER OF FACILITIES NOT JUST IN THE SKILLED NURSING SETTING BUT ASSISTED LIVING SETTING I KNOW- SECRETARY TIAS HAS SIMILAR STORIES SO IT CAN CERTAINLY BE DONE AND HAS BEEN DONE I WOULD SAY THAT PART OF WHAT WE SEE ABSOLUTELY YEARS AS COMMUNITY SPREADING INCREASES. SO THE CURRENT WAVE OF INCREASED CASES ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LOW ARE- EARLY INDICATORS OF THE SPREAD THAT WE WILL AGAIN SEE IN SOME OF OUR CONGREGATE CARE FACILITY. SO WITH THIS INCREASE AND COMMUNITY SPREAD WE HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR OWN VIGILANCE AND SOME OF THOSE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES THE OTHER POINT OF OUR IMPORTANCE IS OUR CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES WHETHER THEIR JAILS AND PRISONS FOR NURSING HOMES OR OTHER SETTING. TO HAVE SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HEALTH. THE NUMBER OF MORE IS AND HAND UP MEDICAL WITHIN. IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHETHER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE STATE LEVEL IS EXTREMELY HIGH COMPARED TO OUR- COMMUNITIES- ARE ARE- I'M NOT. IN CONGREGATE SETTING COMMUNITIES AND THAT DOES. PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO THE LEVEL OF VULNERABILITY AROUND KOBE NINETEEN WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH UNDERLYING CONDITIONS LEND THEMSELVES TO THE WORST OUTCOMES THE CDC AND PRACTICED UPDATED OVER THE WEEKEND THE LIST OF TIERED. CONDITIONS THAT SEEM TO HAVE THE HIGHEST RISK OF BAD OUTCOMES WITH PREVENT NINETEEN AND THE STATE LOOKS AT THAT AND UPDATES OUR OWN GUIDANCE SUPPORT. THANK YOU DOCTOR GO JUST TWO QUICK QUESTION SINCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY BACKGROUND MATERIALS FOR THIS THIS HEARING- THERE ARE TWO THINGS I'D LIKE TO. I UNDERSTAND OR OR HAVE SOME. DATA PROVIDED ONE IS WHAT IS THE FLU- STATISTICS SO HOW MANY DEATHS DO WE SEE IN PRISONS YEAR OVER YEAR- SO DO WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT'S ABNORMAL OR ABOVE THAT THE TREND. AND THE SECOND IS HOW HOW'S CALIFORNIA IT'S PRISON SYSTEM- DOING COMPARED TO THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES ARE ARE- PER CAPITA NUMBERS SIMILAR ABOVE OR BELOW- SO IF YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION NOW THAT BE GREAT BUT OTHER OTHERWISE I'D I'D LIKE TO. SEE A JUST THE- ELITE ANALYZE HOW WE'RE DOING- YEAR OVER YEAR AND STATE BY STATE THANK YOU. YEAH WE DON'T I DON'T HAVE IT TODAY BUT WILL WORK WITH A CD PH AS WELL AS OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES ON THIS PANEL TO GET YOU THAT INFORMATION SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WELCOME AND ARE MORE LIKE A DOCTOR GOING FOR YOU ARE NO LONGER. ABLE STAY WITH US I HAVE A QUESTION. ON THE COURTS PUT OUR PRISONS UNDER RECEIVERSHIP WE HAVE A RECEIVER NOW FOR THAT HEALTH. BUT THAT RECEIVERS ALSO OVER TIME TURNED CERTAIN FACILITIES ABOUT HALF THE FACILITIES BACK OVER TO SEE THE SHORE SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IN THAT PROCESS THAT HALF ABOUT HALF THE FACILITIES ARE STILL UNDER THE RECEIVER AND ANOTHER HALF OR NOT. NOW THE RECEIVER WHEN WE HEAR FROM IN MAY INDEED THE STORE'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE ARE A- DEBT THIS IS OF OBVIOUSLY A SYSTEM WIDE PROBLEM. AND THAT IT NEEDS COMPETENT PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHETHER EPIDEMIOLOGISTS OR OTHERS TO BE CALLING THE SHOTS AS TO WHAT HAPPENS AND DEVELOPING A PLAN SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF VOTE OF HER. PERSON ALL WILL BE DOES THE- TO OVERSEE. THIS WHAT HOW WE RESPOND TO THIS OUTBREAK AND CONTAINING IT AND ALL TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF DEATHS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'M GOING TO LET SUSAN FINALE ANSWER MOST OF THAT QUESTION BUT I WILL SAY THAT SECRETARY DHEAS MENTIONED OUR HOT ACTIVATION OF THE INCIDENT COMMAND TEAM WHICH WILL INCLUDE. EXTRA CHEESE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL FOR AROUND- EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRACKING THE DISEASE INFECTION CONTROL AND THOSE SUPPORTS ARE AVAILABLE AND- COMING TO BEAR ON THAT TEAM. THAT INCIDENT CAME AREN'T ONLY FOR SAN QUENTIN OR FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. BASS AND MICHELLE INCIDENT. TEAM IS FORCING QUENTIN BUT I KNOW SECRETARY DS'S SHARED- I'LL PLAN ENVISIONED FOR EXTENDING MAD AND WE ARE READY TO PARTNER AND PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT WE CAN IN NEED SO THE RESPONSES ADEQUATE I THINK WE AS A AGENCY ARE CONTINUE TO STAND READY. TO PROVIDE BOTH GUIDANCE AND ASSISTANCE IN ANY WAY THAT WE CAN- AND- IF IT REQUIRES ALSO SELLS TO BRING ON ADDITIONAL STAFF. WILL DO WHAT WE CAN EXPEDIENCY AND TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION AS I'VE SAID IN OTHER PRESS CONFERENCES AND OTHER HEARING. THERE IS A LIVE VIRUS THEY GO. IN ORDERS FROM ZERO SIXTY VERY QUICKLY WE SEE THAT BY THE TIME YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO TEST OF EVERYONE THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE INFECTED AND THAT WE HAVE TO DO WHAT I STARTED THIS- SORT OF MY BRIEF COMMENTS WITH IN TERMS OF SEPARATING OUT THOSE WHO ARE IN GOOD IN THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN CONTINUING THE TAP SO WE READY TO CAN YOU. SEE FOR A SECOND D. AS AND THE RECEIVER IN ANY WAY THAT- IT IS NEEDED AND OF COURSE TO ADD OUR EXPERTISE THROUGH PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND THEN ON BLOOM WAY. ISSUED A CHANCE TO. SOME BRIEF COMMENTS AND IF THERE ARE FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR ME- I CAN BE REACHED DIRECTLY OR- THROUGH THROUGH STAFF AND I'D BE- HONORED TO PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I CAN. DOWN THE ROAD THNK YOU THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN GIVING PROVIDING US THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE AND I'M SURE WE WILL HAVE. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO NOW MEMBERS IS TURNED TO SEASON FINALE. AND THEN WE WILL HEAR FROM THE RECEIVER AND THEN WE CAN OPEN QUESTIONS TO ALL TO. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF- POLISHING PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE RECEIVER AND ALSO THE SECRETARY DS. SO LET'S NOW TO ON SEASON FINALE. MORNING BURNED BY US TO THE STATEMENT HERE MY NAME SYSTEM LA NINE THE CHEAP. YEAH FOR QUALITY PROGRAM. IN THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH. AND WAS ASKED TO GIVE A LITTLE CONTACTS NATIONALLY THERE ARE TWO POINT SIX MILLION CORRECT CASES. AND TOTAL DEATHS OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE. WE NOW IN CALIFORNIA HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND CASES- WITH A NEW CASES CLIMBING EACH DAY- AND RESULTING IN. A TOTAL OF. IN THE LAST TWENTY HOURS A NUMBER THAT RELATING HE SAYS INCREASED BY TWO POINT 9% AND DEATHS INCREASED FIVE POINT 7% SO CLEARLY A PROBLEM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALIZATIONS HAVE INCREASED- YESTERDAY BY THREE HUNDRED CASES FOR A OTAL OF- HOUSING HOSPITALIZATIONS OF FIVE THOUSAND SEVENTY SEVEN THAT'S LIKE AN INCREASE OF SIX POINT THREE PERCENT. AT THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY MOST CASES ALCOVE IN NINETEEN WERE IN RETURNING TRAVELERS THE FIRST RECOGNIZED ME TRANSMISSION WAS IDENTIFIED IN LATE FEBRUARY. EARLY MARCH CASE NUMBERS BEGAN TO INCREASE AND ON MARCH FOURTH AND THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN CALIFORNIA AS THE NUMBER OF CASES BEGAN TO INCREASE- WE AND FROM THE GOVERNOR AND PLAN AND THAT ON. A STATE WIDE STAND HOME ORDER PARKS NINETEEN. DURING THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC TESTING WAS EXTREMELY LIMIT AT INITIALLY TESTING WAS ONLY AVAILABLE AT THE CDC CASTING BECAME AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC HEALTH LAB IN LATE. WARY AND SUCCEED WE WAS AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIAL LABORATORIES TESTING PRIORITIZE. FOR ONLY 7% AND BURDENS EXPOSED IN HIGH RISK SETTINGS I'M PARTICULARLY HOW ARE WORKERS. IN RESOURCES WERE NOT ABLE BASS FIND HAS OR WILL. ISN'T CORRECTION FACILITIES UNTIL LATER. THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HATS WERE CONDUCTED OVER. TWO MONTHS LATER BROUGHT PEACE. TING IT DROPPED. THE NOT. IN CALIFORNIA NOW RE MOVED UP TO OF OVER FOR ME AND IN OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND THE DAYS AND EACH DAY THE RATE OF POSITIVE TESTS OVER LAST DAYS AS FAR POINT 6% AND THE POSITIVITY OVER THE SEVEN IS POINT VERSE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE IS CLIMB. AS TEST CAPACITY AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEPLOYING THIS TESTING TO CONTROL DISEASE AND CONGREGATE SETTINGS HAS INCREASED AS WELL WE CONTINUE A LEARN ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION THAT'S VERY INFECTIOUS VIRUS WHICH IS HARD TO CONTAIN IN ANY ENVIRONMENT BUT VERY CHALLENGING AND CONGREGATE SAT AT. I AM VERY GOAL. DOCTOR GODLY WENT OVER OUR TO PREVENT THE VIRUS FROM ENTERING THE FACILITY AND TO AGGRESSIVELY WORK TO REDUCE TRANSMISSION WHAT A CASE OR CASES ARE IDENTIFIED. SECTION CONTROL MEASURES WILL NOT STOP ALL INFECTIONS AS MANY STATE. AS MANY STAFF AND MAYES MAY ALREADY BE EXPOSED TO MAY DEVELOP SYMPTOMS OVER. THE NEXT TEN TO FOURTEEN DAYS ONCE THE FIRST CASES ARE RECOGNIZED RECOMMEND AYE RECOMMENDATIONS TO TASTIC WRESTLING WILL RESULT IN THE GROWTH OF THE NUMBER OF CASES AS A SYMPTOMATIC CASES WILL BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THAT TESTING. THE PAGE HAS BEEN PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION- AND CCH THE ASK THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SERVES AS A TECHNICAL CONSULTANT TO CDC ARE AN A RECEIVER FOR STATE PRISON OUTBREAK'S ACROSS THE STATE. EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC WE ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GENERAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT POSTED ON THE DVR WEBSITE PROVIDED ALL OF GUIDANCE ON HOW GREAT GREAT CONTROL. WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN NUMEROUS MEETINGS AND PROVIDE A VERBAL AND WRITTEN GUIDANCE ON SPECIFIC PERSON SITUATIONS WE DO HAVE DEDICATED STAFF ABOUT HELP WITH THIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. GIVE AND- AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SOME STANDARDIZED GUIDANCE WE RECOGNIZE THAT GIVEN THE LAY OUT OF THE PRISON THE GENERAL ASIAN HEALTH OF THE INMATES IN A PARTICULAR BIRDS. PRESENT THE AVAILABILITY OF STAFF AND THE PROVISION OF PP AND ANY OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES MAKE IT NECESSARY TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL PLANS. WHEN CASES IN BOYS OR INMATES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED SEE PAGE HAS PROVIDED VERBAL GUIDANCE ON THAT SITUATION AND HAS BEEN TRACKING CASES OF DVR HAS BEEN TRACKING THOSE CASES AND- EMPLOYEES AND PROVIDING DATA ON THEIR WEBSITE. TESTING SURE SHORTAGES WERE PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE NATION EARLY ONSET CVH WORK VERY HARD TO DEVELOP AND THE TESTING PLAN PROVIDING OPTIONS FOR MATCHING AVAILABLE LABORATORY RESOURCES. FOR BOTH SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND CONDUCTING LABORATORY TESTS OF THE NEEDS OF PERSONS ACROSS THE STATE. EVEN WITH EXPANDED TESTING FACILITY SOMETIMES BASED LONGER OF AN IDEAL TURN AROUND TIMES AND- ALLOWING THEM TO BETTER MANAGE THE SITUATION. MORE RECENTLY WE ASSIST IN PROVIDING AN OVERALL TESTING STRATEGY SIMILAR TO THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. INCLUDING BOTH SURVEILLANCE TESTING PRISONS WITH NO ACT BREAKS YOU PRIOR BASELINE TESTING- OVER. EACH WEEK MORE AGGRESSIVE SERIAL CAUGHT DOWN AND FACILITIES WITHOUT BREAKS. EXISTING I'M NOT POSITIVE BUT SALUTE ALLOW FOR REALLY COME HARDING I THESE A- CASES AND ALLOWS THIS AT LEAST YOUR- THE COORDINATES AND ALL LIMIT THE MOVE OF STAFF AND THE- I'M IN ADDITION WE WORKED. DEVELOP A MORE DETAILED INFECTION CONTROL GUIDANCE WITH VERY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS- BETTER ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS OF EACH PRESENT. THIS GUIDANCE PROVIDES STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTING STAFF FROM INTRODUCING THE VIRUS WHEN THEN THE FACILITY AND AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO CONTAINING THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE PREVENTION AND CONTROL INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING MONOGRAM ALL STAFF AND INMATES FOR SIGNS OF AND SYMPTOMS UNIVERSAL MASKING BY STAFF AND INMATES FOR SOURCE CONTROL USE OF RECOMMENDED PERSONAL. REQUIREMENTS MAINTAINING UP CRITICAL DISTANCING AND ENVIRONMENTAL. CLEANING AND DISINFECTION. THE HAS BEEN ON THE GROUND WORKING WITH CDC AN RECEIVER I'M PARTICULARLY. LOS ANGELES COUNTY. KOALA AVENAL IN KINGS COUNTY- CALIFORNIANS SUPERMAN AND SAN QUENTIN ON THE CONTROL OF- COPING NINETEEN IMPRISONS DEPENDS O MANY STRATEGIES MINIMIZING VISITATION AND NONESSENTIAL MOVEMENT FROM OUTSIDE WORST REYES AND SCREEN EMPLOYEES AND ANYONE ENTERING THE PRESENTS EQUESTRIAN MADE FOR FOURTEEN DAYS AND ENSURING THAT EMPLOYEES WORKING WITH SEQUESTERED INMATES DO NOT WORK WITHIN. THE OTHER PARTS OF REPRESENT EXCLUDING ANY AND ALL ILL EMPLOYEES PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING WEARING MASKS BRANAGH AND PRACTICING SAFE HIM HIDING FOR ALL STAFF AND INMATES CANCEL CANCELING NONESSENTIAL GATHERINGS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT I'M OF EMPLOYEES BETWEEN DIFFERENT WORK- AREAS QUARANTINE EXPOSED INMATES FOR FOURTEEN DAYS I SLIPPING APART AND- INMATES TESTING AND EXCLUDING. EXPOSED STAFF FROM WORK- CANNOT RUN HOST OF OTHERS THAT WE'VE BEEN LAYING OUT SINCE BEGINNING OF THE- SOME OF THESE. ARE GIVE TO ACCOMPLISH BY BALANCING THE NEEDS OF OPERATING A PRISON GIVEN STOPPING SHORT OF JUST SPACE CONSTRAINTS. GAINES AND OTHER OPERATIONAL NEEDS- AND AS DOCTOR DOLLY AND OTHERS HVE AND MENTIONED. WE ARE AND TAKING A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE STAND AND ON THAT COMING TOGETHER FOR THE- SITUATION ST MARTIN ST MARTIN- ESTABLISHING THAT INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM. TO COORDINATE PATIENT CARE AND MOVEMENT- AS WELL AS TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THESE INFECTION AND PREVENTION STRATEGIES ARE IN PLACE. WE CONTINUED TO RECOGNIZE THIS CHALLENGE CHALLENGE AND BOTH- AND ALL CONGREGATE SETTINGS BUT PRIMARILY IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND PRISONS AND WE'RE HERE TO PARTNER AND- WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DEDICATED STAFF TO THIS EFFORT. AND ARE HAPPY TO NOT ONLY PLAY THE ROLE OF THE TECHNICAL. CANCEL BUT TO BE PART OF THE THESE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU FINALITY- I WILL NOTE THAT THE VISITATION STOCKED CDC ARE ENDED VISITATION ALL FACILITIES. BEFORE APRIL FIRST ADDITIONALLY- AND MANY OF THE THINGS YOU DESCRIBED WERE AT LEAST BY THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN. THE INDICATIONS IMPLEMENTED AND YET MANY WERE NOT BUT- YET WE HAVE THE SITUATION WE HAVE TODAY O HOW THOROUGHLY THESE WERE IMPLEMENTED BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION THEMSELVES STOP THE TRANSFER FROM COUNTY JAILS THE VISITATION WAS STOPPED ALL OF THOSE THINGS WERE DONE. WAY BUT LET'S NOW- TURNED TO CLARK KELSO WHO IS THE FEDERAL RECEIVER FOR. THE OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES MISTER COLE SO HE- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS CLARK KELSO I SERVICE THE FEDERAL RECEIVER RESPONSIBLE FOR MEDICAL CARE WITHIN CDC ARE. I WAS APPOINTED TO THIS POSITION BY THE FEDERAL COURT IN THE CLASS ACTION LITIGATION PALMER SCHWARZENEGGER IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND WAS CHARGED WITH BRINGING THE LEVEL OF MEDICAL CARE UP TO CONSTITUTIONAL SANDERS AS RECEIVER I EXERCISE ALL THE POWERS THAT SECRETARY DIAZ POSSESSES BUT WITH RESPECT ONLY TO THE DEPARTMENTS MEDICAL CARE SYSTEM. THAT'S WHY BOTH SECRETARY DIAZ AND I ARE HERE TODAY. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE AN IMPROVING CDC ARE THE OVERALL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO THE COVERT RISKS. AND I HAVE DELEGATED ON A BACK TO THE STATE- MANAGERS YOU NOTED THE MANAGEMENT OF NINETEEN OF ITS THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS. WHICH IS A PRESUMPTIVE INDICATOR THAT THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE DELIVERING A CONSTITUTIONAL LEVEL OF CARE. CODE OF COURSE IS A NEW AND SYSTEM WIDE CHALLENGE AND SO I WORKED MOST CLOSELY WITH SECRETARY DIAZ AND UNDERSECRETARY FOR HEALTHCARE DIANA SO SEAN COVERT MATTERS. FACED WITH THE CRISIS OF CODE OUR COLLABORATION HAS NEVER BEEN CLOSER. I'D LIKE TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR PLANNING AND EFFORTS TO COMBAT COBRE NINETEEN OVER THE LAST FOUR MONTHS. SOME COMMENTS ON THE CRISIS AT SAN QUENTIN AND A BRIEF STATUS REPORT AND THEN OF COURSE THE QUESTION. PLANNING AS YOU. BEGAN A LATE. BOB AS YOU KNOW CDC ARE ESSENTIALLY OPERATES THE LARGEST CONGREGATE LIVING FACILITIES IN THE STATE WHICH ARE PERFECT FACILITIES FOR THE SPREAD OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. SO ON MARCH ELEVENTH A CBC OURS PUBLIC HEALTH BRANCH ISSUED ITS FIRST CODE GUIDANCE TO THE INSTITUTIONS- ARE BASED IN PART IN INCLUDING LINKS TO GUIDANCE PUBLISHED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE CALIFORNIA OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION. AND WE BEGAN POSTING THAT GUIDANCE ON OUR INTRANET AGES. WE ALSO RELEASED OUR PUBLIC FACING INTERNET SITES THAT CONTAIN THE COBRA TRACTOR FOR THE PRISONS. A CDC OURS CO WOULD PREPAREDNESS BABY IS AND HEALTH CARE AS INTERIM GUIDANCE. OF THE INTERIM GUIDANCE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE IT HAS THE BASICS TO HELP COMBAT ON OUR- INCLUDING THE- ON TEST I SAW. CONTACT TRACING QUARANTINE MONITORING HOSPITAL REFERRALS- EVERYTHING THE DOCTOR GALLEY HAS MENTIONED. BUT TWO DAYS LATER ON MARCH THIRTEENTH SECRETARY IDEAS AND I SENT OUT OUR FIRST COMMUNICATION DAHLE CDC OUR EMPLOYEES TO BE IN REORIENTING EVERYONE TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE CUT OFF. AND OUR FIRST CASE OCCURRED ONLY ONE WEEK LATER ON MARCH TWENTIETH FC I AM THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR MEN. NO DURING MARCH AND APRIL AS YOU'VE HEARD CD'S YARD TOOK A SERIES OF IMPORTANT STATUS- INCLUDING ESTABLISHING AN OVERALL COOPER NINETEEN COORDINATOR STANDING UP THE DEPARTMENT'S OPERATIONS CENTER. SENDING OUT GUIDANCE FOR FACILITY ENTRANCE SCREENING FOR ALL STAFF. IMPLEMENTING IT IMPLEMENTING AN ACCELERATED RELEASE PROGRAMS. IMPOSING SEVERE RESTRICTIONS ON IN TROUGH FACILITY MOVEMENT SHUTTING DOWN VISITATIONS HOLDING ALL NONESSENTIAL TRANSFERS BETWEEN PRISONS. AND THE CLOSING CDC ARE TO INTAKE. THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT SEE I AM BROUGH SLOWLY DURING APRIL- BUT CASES SPIKE ON MAY FIRST THE JUMPING FROM NINETY ONE TO TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN. AND THE NUMBER OF CASES CONTINUED CLIMBING REACHING A HIGH OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE BY MAY FIFTEENTH. AS A RESULT DURING THE FIRST THREE WEEKS OF MAY- WE CONSIDERED WHETHER WE COULD SAFELY MOVE A LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE. VULNERABLE PATIENTS THE NEGATIVES TO ANOTHER FACILITY. WITH THE GOAL OF SAVING LIVES. THE DECISION INVOLVED THE BALANCING OF THE GROWING RISKS TO THE SEA I AM PATIENTS AGAINST THE RISKS OF ANY LARGE SCALE TRANSFER. WE WERE ALSO CONSIDERING IN MAY HOW THE DEPARTMENT GOOD SLOWLY BEGAN RE OPENING AND REESTABLISHING SOME OF ITS NORMAL PROCESS. AND ON MAY TWENTY TWO A MEMORANDUM WAS DISTRIBUTED TO THE FIELD ANNOUNCING CDC OURS PHASED APPROACH WHICH INCLUDED A SLOW RE OPENING OF INTAKE. AND THE RESUMPTION OF IN OUR INSTITUTION WITH. ATTACHED TO THAT MEMORANDUM WAS A COLD SCREENING AND TESTING MATRIX FOR PATIENT MOVEMENT. OF THE NATION THE MATRIX PROVIDED AMONG OTHER THINGS BUT A TRANSFERRING PATIENT SHOULD RECEIVE A CODE TEST BUT A PATIENT COULD TRANSFER ONLY IF THE TEST WAS NEGATIVE AND THE NO INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION PRIOR TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THEIR TEST RESULTS. ON OR ABOUT MAY TWENTY THIRD WE DECIDED THAT THE EXPANDING CASES AB CIM. POSED AN UNACCEPTABLE RISK TO THE LAST REMAINING DORM. WHERE HUNDREDS OF CODE HIGH RISK PATIENTS WERE HOUSE. AND THE DECISION WAS TAKEN TO MOVE THOSE PATIENTS OUT OF SEE I AM. SOMEONE MOVED TO CORCORAN AND THE REMAINDER WERE MOVED TO SAM QUITE. BECAUSE THE MATRIX- DID NOT SPECIFY THAT THE REQUIRED NEGATIVE COPE WITH TEST HAD TO OCCUR WITHIN ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IN RELATION TO THE TRANSFER SUCH AS SEVEN DAYS OR LESS. WHEN THE MOVES WERE MADE OUT OF SEE I AM ALTHOUGH ALL PATIENTS HAD NEGATIVE TEST RESULT. IN MANY CASES THE TESTS WERE TWO THREE AND IN SOME CASES FOUR WEEKS ALL. FAR TOO OLD TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR FOR THE ABSENCE OF CO. AS IT TURNED OUT. TO OF THE SIXTY SIX PATIENTS MOVED TO CORCORAN TESTED POSITIVE WHEN THEY WERE RETESTED AT CORCORAN. S. ONE NEGATIVE COCHRAN HAS BEEN MANAGING THEIR OUTBREAK PRETTY WELL SO FAR THEY HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE CASES ACTIVE THIRTY CASES HAVE ALREADY RESOLVED AND THEY HAVE HAD FORTY SEVEN OF THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE CASES IN THE LAST FOURTEEN DAYS. THEY'VE SENT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ONLY ONE PATIENT. WHEN OF COURSE BEEN A VERY DIFFERENT STORY AND DEALS IN CRISIS. UPON RETESTING OF SAN QUENTIN TWENTY FIVE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO TRANSFER RES TESTED POSITIVE. AND SAN QUENTIN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FELL BEHIND THE BAR STE. ON JUNE TWELVE I ASKED THE DOCTOR RE WILLIAMS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE DOCTOR STEP RETURNS THE FROM THE UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO CONDUCT AN IN PERSON ASSESSMENT. THEY VISITED THE PRISON THE NEXT DAY ON JUNE THIRTEENTH AND REPORTED SERIOUS RESOURCE DEFICIENCIES ON THE PHYSICAL PLANT. IN COVERT SUPPORT STAFFING INDIAN TEST. THE FOLLOWING DEFICIENCIES MOST OF WHICH WERE IDENTIFIED IN THEIR REPORT. REALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE RAPID SPREAD OF CODE BUT IT STANDPOINT. FIRST DEPRIVED YOUR CELL BLOCKS LIKE GOOD VENTILATION AND I HAVE A VIRUS SPREAD CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO A DORMITORY SETTING. EVEN THOUGH IN MAYES OUR HOUSE IN CELLS AND ALSO. THE VIRUS SPREAD VERY RAPIDLY IN THOSE CONDITIONS. SECOND WE HAD TESTING TURN AROUND TIME PROBLEMS. NO WE DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS WERE WE SUCCESSFULLY CONTAINED THE VIRUS BUT WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM AT SAN QUENTIN. OUR VENDOR IS AGREED TO PUT OUR TEST AT A HIGHER PRIORITY WITHIN THEIR TESTING SYSTEM. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE BIO OF IN SAN FRANCISCO TO PERFORM SOME OF OUR TEST. WE HAVE COMPLETED THE FIRST ROUND OF TESTING OF ALL PATIENTS ON SAN QUENTIN WHO CONSENTED TO BE TEST. THIRD MANY PATIENTS AT SAN QUENTIN REFUSED BEING TESTED OR EVEN BEING ASSESSED FOR SYMPTOMS. THE FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN TWO AND THREE HUNDRED PATIENTS IN EAST BLOC ARE REFUSING TEST AND ASSESS. AND THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE OUTBREAK. YESTERDAY THE PRISON LAW OFFICE OFFERED TO ASSIST US IN WORKING WITH THEIR CLIENTS ON THIS ISSUE. AN OFFER WE OF COURSE HAVE ACCEPTED AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THE PRISON LAW OFFICE FOR THEIR HELP IN THIS REGARD. FOURTH AND FINALLY THE PHYSICAL LAYOUT AT SAN QUENTIN MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE POPULATION DURING AN OUTBREAK. IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE PATIENTS APPROPRIATELY IN THE INSTITUTION NEEDS ADDITIONAL BEDS SPECS. WE HAVE HOPE LAST WEEK BUT ONE WAY OF INCREASING THE AVAILABLE SPACE WAS TO MOVE ONE HUNDRED INMATES FROM THE SAN QUENTIN GYMNASIUM. TO AN EMPTY WEARING OF HOUSING UP NORTH KERN STATE PRISON. TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THAT TRANSPORT. WE HAD ADOPTED A MUCH STRICTER TRANSPORT TESTING POLICY. SO THAT ALL ONE HUNDRED PATIENTS HAD TO RECEIVE A NEGATIVE COBRA TEST NO MORE THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS PRIOR TO THE TRANSPORT. ON SATURDAY WE LEARN THE TWO OF THOSE PATIENTS HAVE RECEIVED POSITIVE TEST RESULTS AND WE CANCEL THE ENTIRE MOVIE. AS OF THIS MORNING TEN POINT REPORTS SO I'LL LET ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN ACTIVE CASES WITH EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINE OF THOSE OCCURRING IN THE LAST FOURTEEN DAYS. WE HAVE HAD ONE DEATH OF A PATIENT WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN. WE HAVE FORTY TWO HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS ARE OUT OF STANDPOINT. I BELIEVE DURING THE WEEK OF JULY SIX IT IS LIKELY THAT WE SHOULD BE SEEING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE POSITIVE CASES AT SAN QUENTIN PERHAPS AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED. MOVE FROM ACTIVE TO RESOLVE THE STATUS SINCE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST THAT MANY POSITIVESWHO ARE STILL A SYMPTOMATIC. OUR TWO BIGGEST CONCERNS NOW ARE INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES THAT STAND POINT TO HANDLE THE ENORMITY OF THE CRISIS. IN THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL HOSPITALS TO DEAL WITH THE FLOW OF SAN QUENTIN PATIENTS. ADMINISTRATION IS RESPONDING TO THE RESOURCE PROBLEM BY DIRECTING CO HELLO YES TO ESTABLISH UNIFIED INSTANT COMMAND HELP MANAGE THE OUTBREAK THAT BEGAN YESTERDAY I BELIEVE. AND WE ARE REDIRECTING ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND REGIONAL HEALTH CARE EX EXECUTIVE TO SUPPORT INSTITUTIONS STAFF IN THE INCIDENT COMMANDER. THIS WILL HELP STABILIZE RESPONSE TO THE OUTBREAK. THE STATE HAS ALSO FLOWN INTENDS FOR ADDITIONALCLINIC AND HOUSING SPACE AND CAL OVER YES WILL BE BRINGING IN A FIELD HOSPITAL TO PROVIDE MORE BEDS AND HOUSE. WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL HOSPITAL CAPACITY WE ARE INFREQUENT ONGOING CONTACT WITH BAY AREA HOSPITALS. IN THIS POINT WE ARE CONFIDENT THE NECESSARY CAPACITY EXISTS. FOR EXAMPLE SETON MEDICAL CENTER IN DALY CITY IS MAKING ITSELF READY TO ACCEPT AND TO ACCEPT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF OUR PATIENTS. AND WE HAVE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE FOR LONGER HOSPITAL. WE DO MONITOR THIS ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT HOSPITAL UTILIZATION CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY DURING THE PANDA. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE MARIN GENERAL HOSPITAL SAN QUENTIN'S PRIMARY LOCAL HOSPITAL IS NOT A CELL HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR OUR LIKELY NEEDS. AND THEY IN THE COMMUNITY ARE UNDERSTANDABLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR ABILITY EVEN IN THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. TO STABILIZE PATIENTS BEFORE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER HOSPITALS. WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH MARIN GENERAL AND IF IT APPEARS THE MARIN GENERAL CANNOT HANDLE FLOW ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE MADE TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS DIRECTLY TO OTHER HOSPITALS. IT WAS NOT THE OVERWHELMING MARIN GENERAL'S RESOURCES. WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THEIR CONCERT. BUT ME CLOSE WITH A BRIEF STATUS REPORT SYSTEM WIDE WE HAVE TWENTY SIX HUNDRED ACTIVE CASES. ONLY TWO HUNDRED CASES THAT HAVE RESOLVED AND TWENTY TWO DEATHS. THAT GIVES US AN OVERALL DEATH RATE OF ZERO POINT 44% WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE STATISTICAL CHALLENGES OF DIFFERENT POPULATION SIZES AND FOUNDERS CDC YOURS CRUDE THE DEATH RATE OF ZERO POINT FOUR FOUR PERCENT. IS A MAGNITUDE OF ORDER LESS THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S GO BUT DEATH RATE WHICH IS TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT. IN THE UNITED STATES IS OVERALL COOPER DEATH RATE WHICH IS FOUR POINT 9% BOB DON'T PUT TOO MUCH RELIANCE ON THAT COMPARISON UNTIL WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. OF THE REFORM A MORE GRANULAR- BETTER ANALYSIS OF THE COMPARISON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES. WE HAVE HAD VERY LARGE OUTBREAKS IN FOR PRISONS SAN QUENTIN WITH- I'M ALONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN POSITIVE STRUCK A WALL OF WITH ONE THOUSAND AND TWIRL POSITIVES. AVENUE ALL NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT POSITIVES AND SEE I AM EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX POSSIBLE. THE OUTBREAK OF CHAKRA WALLACH AND HAVING ALL HAVE MOSTLY ROSE ALL. SEE I AM pRESOLVED SAN QUENTIN WERE AT THE BEGINNING. NEXT WE SUCCESSFULLY MANAGED A MODERATE OUTBREAK AT- CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN WHICH HAD AT ONE TIME ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TOTAL CASES. BUT WHICH NOW HAS ALL SIX. ONLY ONE OF THOSE IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN DAY. SEE I DO EXPERIENCE ONE DEATH. A PRISON LANCASTER ALSO HAD A MODERATE OUTBREAK WITH ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT POSITIVES ALL OF WHOM HAVE NOW RESOLVED WITH ZERO CASES NO LAST FOURTEEN DAYS. WE HAVE ANOTHER FOR PRISONS WITH MODERATE OUTBREAKS THAT SO FAR APPEAR TO HAVE PEAKED WITH AROUND TWO HUNDRED OR FEWER TOTAL CASE. FINALLY WE HAVE FOURTEEN INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED SMALL OUTBREAKS. THAT HAVE NOT BLOSSOMED INTO MODERATE OR LARGE EVENTS AND A LEVIN FACILITIES WITH NO CODE CASES AMONG INMATES CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED. THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS GIVEN COVE ITS EASE OF ENTERING AND SPREADING AND CONGREGATE HOUSING SET. THESE NUMBERS I THINK DO INDICATE THAT HOPE IT DOES NOT SPREAD YEAH THROUGHOUT THE CDC OUR SYSTEM IN AN UNCONTROLLED TRASH. BUT GIVEN THE GLOBAL IS GOING TO BE WITH US FOR QUITE SOME TIME- I SHARE EVERYONE'S CONCERNED. ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE TO DATE STILL IS NOT ENOUGH THERE IS MORE THAT CAN BE DONE. BECAUSE THE VIRUS HAS PLENTY OF TIME TO CONTINUE SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW UNTIL THINGS TO STABILIZE FURTHER SYSTEM WIDE SECRETARY DIAZ HAS CLOSED AND TAKE AGAIN STOP ALL UNNECESSARY MOVEMENT BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS. REIMPOSED A SYSTEM WIDE MODIFIED PROGRAM. AND ADOPTED A NEW AND CONTINUING XCELERATED RELEASE PROGRAM. AND I KNOW THAT HE SHARES MY VIEW THAT WE WILL NOT OPEN AND TAKE YOUR STARK MOVEMENT AGAIN. UNTIL WE HAVE ASSURED OURSELVES AND OTHERS ARE ASSURED. IT CAN BE DONE SAFELY. THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR YOUR ATTENTION I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER CARROLL SO MEMBERS WE'VE NOW HEARD FROM THE- PANELISTS FOR THE FIRST PANEL SO I WILL. OPEN IT TO QUESTIONS I WOULD FIRST THOUGH LIKE TO ASK AND THIS CAN BE SECRETARY DS FOR MR CALLACE SO. WELL THERE WAS INDICATION THAT GUIDE YOU KNOW THERE'S NOW A LIMITED NUMBERS I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT BY. THE DVR'S OWN STATISTICS POSTED ON YOUR WEBSITE THERE HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE AT TWENTY FOUR OUT OF THE THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES THAT'S BUYING YOUR OWN WEBSITE. NOW I WOULD SUSPECT THERE COULD BE FAR MORE THAN NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED BY ALL THE PANELISTS THUS FAR THAT NOT EVERY INMATE IS TESTED SO SINCE THERE'S NOT THROW TESTING WE CAN'T KNOW. BUT ADDITIONALLY. THERE IS STAFF WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE OUT THIRTY FOUR OUT OF THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES THE ONLY FACILITY WHERE STAFF IS NOT TESTED POSITIVE IN THIS IS ON CDC OURS WEBSITE THIS YEAR CONSERVATION CENTER HOW FOR. ONE COURSE RATED PERSON DID TEST POSITIVE FOR THE VIRUS SO THAT WAS THE VIRUS. PRESIDENT WARS. AT ALL THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES. AND WHILE THERE MAY NOT BE ACTIVE CASES AT ALL FACILITIES SINCE WE ALSO DO NOT REQUIRE THE TESTING OF THE STAFF. AND EDITION ONLY STAFF REPORT ON WHETHER THEY HAVE COVE IT IS SELF REPORTED I GUESS THE POINT OF THIS IS. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO REQUIRE STAFF TO BE TESTED AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO REQUIRE STAFF TO HAVE TO INFORM THE DEPARTMENT WHEN THEY ARE POSITIVE AND SIMILARLY WHEN ARE WE GOING TO HAVE MORE THOROUGH TESTING. OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION IN EITHER SECRETARY DHEAS OR MR CALL SO YOU YOU COULD RESPOND TO. SO CALLED ALL NOT TAKE THIS THAT TESTING. SO AS FAR AS A STAFF TESTING GOES. WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY TRYING TO SEEK GREATER CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE GREATER TESTING AT ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS BUT AS SAID EARLIER IN MY STATEMENT IT IS BECOMING IT IS DIFFICULT TO. RECEIVE AND OBTAIN CONTRACTS TO BE ABLE TO SUFFICIENTLY TEST ALL STAFF MEMBERS AT ALL INSTITUTIONS. AND WITH THAT BECAUSE OF THAT CONCERN I HAVE LEANED INTO WHAT THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WITH DIRECTOR WG. JUST TO SEE IF I CAN GET RESOURCES THAN ASSISTANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE- BEGAN SEEKING TO TEST AT INSTITUTIONS- WHERE WE HAVE OUTBREAKS. STAFF ARE REQUIRED TO LET US KNOW IF WE IF THEY HAVE TESTED POSITIVE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY DO LET US THOUGH THE MAJORITY OF THAT STAFF POSITIVES ARE REPORTED TO US BECAUSE THEY HAVE TESTED IN THE COMMUNITY- AT THEIR OWN DOCTORS. THE REPORTED BACK- SO THAT IS IN PLACE THAT IS A REQUIREMENT OF STUFF BUT THEY MUST LET US KNOW THAT THEY- ALSO. MA'AM CHAIR ON THE- SIDE OF INMATE TEST. YEAH THE THREE AND APRIL WE'D SIMPLY AS BOBBY GALLEYS INDICATED WE DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE. WE DIDN'T HAVE TESTING RESOURCES TO CONDUCT THE SORT OF TESTING THAT- WIDESPREAD TESTING THAT WOULD LET US DO SURVEILLANCE OF HOW MANY INSTITUTIONS HAD CODE. NOW WE DID FINALLY- AS TESTING RESOURCES BECAME MORE GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN MAY. INSTITUTE A SURVEILLANCE TESTING PROGRAM WHERE WE DID NOT TEST ALL INMATES BECAUSE WE STILL DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TESTING CAPACITY BUT WE- BASED ON SOME STATISTICAL MODEL PREPARED BY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE DIVISION. OF TESTED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT SAMPLES OF THE INMATES EL ALL INSTITUTIONS. TO SEE IF WE COULD IDENTIFY WHERE WE HAD OUR GOAL WOULD PRESENT IN THE INMATE POPULATION AND WHAT IF WE FOUND A POSITIVE CASE THEN WE WOULD FOCUS ATTENTION ON WE NEED TO TEST EVERYBODY OF THAT INSTITUTION- TODAY WE HAVE- ESSENTIALLY TWENTY THOUSAND OR SO BUT THIRTY THOUSAND OR SO TESTS AVAILABLE TO US. ON THAT WE CAN USE A WEEKLY BASIS- SO- IT IS. IT IS CURRENTLY BEING EXAMINED HOW WE CAN EXPAND THE SURVEILLANCE TESTING PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK GUARD SAMPLE SIZE WAS LARGE ENOUGH. SO THAT WE COULD CATCH UP ENOUGH PRISONS EARLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT A LARGER OUTBREAKS SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF NOW DOING THE SAME THING- SECRETARY DEALS IS DOING ON THE EMPLOYEE SIDE. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE EXPAND THE NUMBER OF BEEN MADE TO GET TESTED. WE DO HAVE THE CHALLENGES ARE EVEN WITH AN EXPANSION OF THAT PROGRAM. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INMATES REFUSING. AND THE IF WE START SUDDENLY SAYING WE'RE GOING TO TEST EVERY AND MADE EVERY SEVEN DAYS I'M QUITE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL HAVE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE REFUSING TO UNDERGO TESTING AT THAT RATE. AND THAT CERTAINLY COMPLICATES ANY EFFORTS TO- IDENTIFY WHERE YOU HAVE. BUT IT'S NOT AN INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONSIDER IS YOU EVALUATE. THE RESULTS YOU'RE GETTING FROM YOUR TESTING PROGRAM. SENATE TURN TO SENATOR MITCHELL NOW I HAVE MANY MORE QUESTIONS BUT ALLOW SENATOR MITCHELL GO AHEAD. I APPRECIATE THAT THAT I'M AT CHAIR ON JUST I'M GOING TO HAVE- THREE TWO TO RECEIVER D. AND WANT TO- EXCUSE ME TO RECEIVE HER KELSO AND WANT TO SECRETARY DEUS. START WITH SOME THE CAL FELL ON. I WAS STRUCK BY YOUR STATEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR TESTIMONY WHEN YOU REALLY BASED ON- THE REALLY THAT THE COURT EQUATED YOUR POSITION ON CAR QUITE FRANKLY WITH SECRETARY D. AS IN TERMS OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WITH REGARD TO HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE FIFTH IN THE PRISONS. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ACCOUNT BY DATE- STARTING MID JUNE OF. WHEN YOU INTERVENE THAT AND TOOK ACTION WITH REGARD TO SEND CLINTON. BUT I'M I'M CURIOUS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT RESPONSIBILITY TO YOU DO YOU TAKE. WITH OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF OUTBREAK SYSTEM WIDE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL- MY RESPONSIBILITY- FROM THE COURT ORDER- WHEN I SAID I HAD SECRETARY DIAZ'S POWERS. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE COURT ORDER SAYS SO I HAVE- HIS OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WITH RESPECT TO CDC ARE AS MEDICAL CARE SYSTEM. AND THEREFORE I SHARE ALL OF THE SAME ACCOUNTABILITY IS ON AS THE SECRETARY. OF THE DEPARTMENT. SO I'VE BEEN INVOLVED FROM DAY ONE A LONG SECRETARY DIAZ AND ON HIS UNDERSECRETARY FOR HEALTHCARE PLAN OF SOCIAL. ON ALL CODE MATTERS I AND I'M ACCOUNTABLE- EIGHT AND- RESPONSIBLE OF BOTH FOR THE SUCCESSES. AND FOR THE FAILURES. THANK YOU FOR THAT I PREFER THAT. ON SECRETARY- DE IS. TOP ABOUT THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE WITH REGARD TO TESTING AND FORM ONE THREE WHAT IS YOUR INTERNAL CAPACITY HE TALKED ABOUT NEEDING TO FIND THE VENDOR WHO COULD MANAGE TESTING AND SO I'M WONDERING WHAT IS YOUR INTERNAL CAPACITY OF GIVING YOUR ROLE AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT HEALTH PERSONNEL ON. ON STILL ON LARGE PART REPORT TO YOU WHAT'S YOUR INTERNAL CAPACITY TO RAMP UP TESTING. FOR PERHAPS A BOWL. ON THOSE INCARCERATED AS WELL AS- PERSONNEL OPERATING WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. ON THE SENATE IMAGE MY RESPONSIBILITIES- ARE TO THE CARE OF INMATES. THE QUESTION OF STAFF TESTING INCLUDING THE TESTING OF MEDICAL ON OF STAFF AND HEALTH CARE STAFF IS REALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CDC OURS OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH OFFICE THEIR WELLNESS OFFICE- NOW NOW I HAVE TESTING CAPACITY THAT BUT WE ARE USING FOR INMATES AND- BUT I'M RELUCTANT TO DIVERT ANY OF THAT- FOR- STAFF TESTING FAIR AND I KNOW THAT SECRETARY DIAZ AND HIS TEAM- THEY ARE AND HAVE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF. ESTABLISHING A CONTRACTS FOR STAFF TESTING ON BUT I NEED TO LET SECRETARY DIAZ I THINK TO TAKE THAT PART OF THE QUESTION. LET LET ME REFRAME THE BECAUSE MY RE QUESTION IS IN IN IN WHAT I HEARD FROM SECRETARY D. AS I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR AN EXTERNAL CONTRACTED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TEST INMATES. SO LESLIE FAIR ENOUGH YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT LET'S LEAVE IT ON PERSONAL ASIDE WHAT IS YOUR INTERNAL CAPACITY TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF TESTING THAT WE ALL NOW. MANY OF US HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED WAS NECESSARY BUT NOW EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF CONSISTENT REGULAR TEST IN EVEN REPEATED TESTING OF INMATES. DO YOU HAVE THE INTERNAL COMPACT BODY THE PROVIDE THAT TESTING OF INMATES WITH THE. FIVE THANK YOU CENTER ON. CLARIFICATION ON. WE BELIEVE THAT NOW WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THE ORDINARY SURVEILLANCE TESTING- THERE EVEN WITH AN EXPANDED PROGRAM THAT WE NEED TO DO OUR OWN NURSING STAFF. IS ABLE TO CONDUCT THAT TYPE OF TESTING PROGRAM. WE HAVE TO OUR TEST KITS PROVIDED BY OUR OUTSIDE GENERAL VENDOR WHO DOES ALL OF OUR LABORATORY TESTING. AND WE ARE ABLE SOUND ALL OF OUR SAMPLES TO THEM WHEN THEY GET THE TEST RESULTS THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY- TRANSFERRED ELECTRONICALLY AND- ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEMS WILL BE GET RESULTS BACK. I YOU HAVE OUR- ON DURING THAT. CRITICAL TWO TO THREE WEEKS. WHEN YOU NEED TO SUDDENLY BE TESTING THOUSANDS OF INMATES AT ONCE FOR THEIR WE ARE MORE CHALLENGE OTHER TWO THINGS THAT WE DO FIRST- WE HAPPENED OVERALL RESOURCES TO TESTING AND AWAY FROM MOST GENERAL HEALTH CARE SO GENERAL HEALTH CARE FUNCTIONS HANDLE SUFFERED DURING THAT PERIOD. THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE DONE THAT I THINK WAS HELPFUL TO ASSUME SOME OF THE- OUTBREAKS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WE HAD ROAD- SUPPORT. WHO COULD HELP THEM DR- SOME OF THAT SURGE TESTING. AND OF THAT HELP WE STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM OF SAN QUENTIN EVEN RIGHT NOW WHERE IN ORDER FOR EVEN AFTER WE'VE DONE ALL THE TESTING. IN ORDER FOR NURSES TO ACTUALLY DO TWICE DAILY ASSESSMENTS OF PATIENTS WITH TESTED POSITIVE. WE DON'T THINK WE HAVE SUFFICIENT STAFF FOR THAT- IT JUST IT IT'S A WORKLOAD THIS MUCH HIGHER- THEN WE ARE STAFF FOR AND WE ARE AT SAN QUENTIN- LOOKING AT- ON BUMPING UP THEIR STAFF RESOURCES BOTH BY DIVERTING NURSES FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS YEAH INCREASING OUR RELIANCE REGISTRY NURSES. BOB SO DURING THAT SURGE PERIOD WELL WHAT WE ARE CHALLENGED. AND IS THERE A PLAN FOR THAT THAT WE BY THEN A THAT YOU HAVE CHALLENGE THERE ARE OF ON PROPOSED FLEW. PERCENT WENT THERE IS A PROPOSED SOLUTION TO A MEDIUM SEND NURSES FROM OTHER IN. WITH REGISTRY THAT'S MY A LONG TERM SOLUTION BUT BECAUSE IF WE GET TO MONIES PRISON SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVING LARGE OUTBREAKS WE WON'T BE ABLE SUPPORT. SO STAFF IS AT THIS POINT I READ I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION FOR IT YET.BUT THEY ARE AT THIS POINT EXPLORING PER WEEK. YES SIR THE STAFF AND WHEN WE NEED. I MY UNDERSTANDING IS AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THIS THE BEAR. OTHER THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE FLORA NURSES. ARE WHO ARE. IN HELPING OUT IN PROVIDING SERVICE. OUR I THINK THE GOV OFFICE HELLO EARLIER A NOW APPROACH. FOR HEALTH CARE FOR TO DO. THEIR TIME MAKE THEM SO OF THE- SO WILL WE'RE GOING TO BE EXT ALL OPTIONS BECAUSE AND- ABOUT THE GOOD CITY THE NURSES OVER THE NEXT WELL TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS IF THAT'S HOW THIS LAUGH. WHAT WE'RE TO NEED TO HAVE MY- CAPACITY. THANK YOU A AND I MISTER FULL. YOUR DEATH CLEARS. AROUND RESPONSE I THE VERY MUCH. BUT THE SECRETARY. YOU KNOW I AM CHAIR OF THE JOINT LETTER BY COMMITTEE AND- THE JAIL BE SEE THROUGH. PROVISIONS OF- SECTION THIRTY SIX. ON CHAPTER TWO OF STATUTES OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE ARE THE ENTITY THAT- APPROVES IF YOU WILL OR CAN CURSE WITH NON BUDGET ACTION ITEMS AS REQUESTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND SO IF YOU'LL LET ME MADAM CHAIR JUST VERY BRIEFLY. TO FOR THE RECORD FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE IN ALL BIG KNOWLEDGE THE MULTIPLE FICTION THIRTY SIX REQUEST LETTERS WE HAVE RECEIVED. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WITH REGARD TO REIMBURSING COUNTIES FOR HOUSING INMATES. DUE TO THE TEMPORARY STOPPAGE OF PRISON INTAKE. IN RESPONSE TO CALL OF IT. AND WE HAVE CONCURRENT WITH ALL OF THOSE REQUESTS THE- FIRST LETTER CAME APRIL SECOND. WE RESPONDED APRIL FIFTH WEAKENED HER. ALL ALWAYS WITH STATEMENTS OF CONCERN ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF COVER NINETEEN CRISIS. AND RIFF QUESTI THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED DETAILED PLAN FOR MITIGATING THE SPREAD OF COAL BUT NINETEEN IN THE STATE'S CORRECTIONAL POPULATIONS THAT REQUEST WAS MADE APRIL FIFTH. THE NEXT LETTER CAME FROM FINANCE MAY EIGHTH. ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION BECAUSE THEY WERE NOW AGAIN HALTING INTAKE FROM COUNTIES AND AGAIN AUGMENTATION REQUESTED TO REIMBURSE COUNTIES NOW FOR HOLDING IN MAKES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. IT'LL PROCESS AND BROWN TO IN TAKEN CORRECTIONS AND BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING COUNTIES TO HOLD THEM NOW FOR ANOTHER THIRTY DAY PERIOD. IT WAS AN ADDITIONAL- BOND EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST. ONCE AGAIN JAIL BC CONCURRED WITH THE NECESSITY OF THOSE CHANGES. ALL AGAIN NO RESPONSE IN TERMS OF THEIR FULL PLAN. ON WYNTON AND MAY ELEVENTH WE RESPONDED TO THE MAY A FOR QUITE A RECOUP- REQUEST ONCE AGAIN RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THAT THE GOP FEE BE PROVIDED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES THAT ARE BEING USED TO ESTABLISH THE PHYSICAL DISTANCE STANDARDS THE MODELING AND THE DATA THAT SHOWS THE CURRENT PRISON POPULATION LEVEL AND THE PROPER PHYSICAL DISTANCING POPULATION LEVEL WERE BEING DONE. BOND AGAIN WITH EVERY. WE CONCUR AND ASK FOR DE. FOR THE LEGISLTURE COULD BE CONFIDENT ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM JUNE SEVENTEENTH ANOTHER SECTION THIRTY SIX LETTER WE RECEIVED FROM FINANCE. ASKING FOR A AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. TO WHICH WE RESPONDED IN A RATHER LENGTHY LETTER JUNE TWENTIETH. WHERE ONCE AGAIN WE ASK ABOUT THE PLAN HOWEVER IN THE STAFF BRIEFING WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STAFF WITH JAIL BE FEES STAFF INCIDENT BUDGET STAFF ASSEMBLY BUDGET FAIR.

SEVENTEEN AND THE BRIEFING PROBABLY OCCURRED WITHIN A DAY OR TWO. WE REPLIED JUNE TWENTIETH OF PROBABLY ONE OF THE MALL STERNLY FRAME THE LETTERS I HAVE TENDED TO DEAL BE FEATURED HERE. SO THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT HAS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT PROTECT THE HEALTH THE SAFETY OF STAFF AND INMATES. AND AT THE DATA NEEDS TO SHOW THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE WORKING. GIVEN THE PROBLEMS OF THE DEPARTMENT IN CANADA ACTED MANY INMATES FROM. LA COUNTY I URGE THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP STRICT PROTOCOLS WITH EACH COUNTY. TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS TRANSFERRED FROM COUNTY JAIL FOR THE PRISONS ARE NEGATIVE OF COAL BUT NINETEEN. BOOK FOR THE OR TRANSFER TO A STATE INSTITUTION. AND I IN THE LETTER. SAYING THAT WE- REQUEST THAT THE MINUTE. HA IN FROM AND THE PART CAN IN.

CONFIRMING THAT KNOLL ADDITIONAL IN MAY FOR THE TRANSFER SO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO WALK THROUGH IN THE CONTEXT OF JAIL BE SEE IN THIS ONE AREA. OUR CONSTANT CONSISTENT EFFORTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR PRACTICES. AND FOR WITH THAT. I'D LIKE IT ON FOURTH NO ONE FROM FAR ON PANEL BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE SECRETARY IN TERMS OF WHAT LEVEL OF. CONFIDENCE WOULD HE SUGGEST WE HAVE THE CITY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. THE BASED ON THEIR LACK OF RESPONSE FOR THE LAST SINCE APRIL SECOND. SENATE BILL FORWARD BASES THAT THERE'S A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE. COMMUNICATIVE WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PLAN IS. GOING FORWARD TO ATTEMPT TO CURB THE ON GOING SPREAD OF COOL BUT NINETEEN. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR MITCHELL AND I WILL SAY. IN RETURN IN REGARDS TO COUNTY AND- AB IN STILL BELIEVE THE CAR OF THE COUNTY IN TECH WAS A SENSE AND KERR THE SPREAD OF KOBE. THEN THERE'S THE- AND TRYING TO AS A WITH A COUNTY INTO TO IN THE SURE. RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ALL HAVE PRESSURE. SO THE AND CALL TO CLOSE FOR COUNTY INTAKE ANY ONE BUT THERE WAS A- NOT BE TO THEM WORKING IT CONTINUE NOT TO TAKE. IT'S FROM THE COUNTY JAIL. THE WAS A PLAN TO TAKE ONLY TRUE INMATES ONE HUNDRED FOR WASCO AND ONE HUNDRED FOR NORTH KERN THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND TAKING IS IF THAT WAS. I THINK THE MAYBE IN A WE KNOW INTENDED BRING IN SEVEN TO OUR SISTER AND OUR SO BECAUSE WE DO THE NUMBER OURS OF OUR RECEPTIONS. TO TALK. AND NOR KERN WE PRIDE TO THAT DECISION WE HAD A FIVE CENTER. WE HAD ONE AND SHE WE HAD ONE AT COULDN'T WE HAD WOMEN D. V. I. WE HAVE ONE IN DELANO. LAW SCHOOL AND THE FEMALES WE HAVE ONE THAT THE CAL QUESTION SO AGAINST THE SO NARRATIVE DOWN TO ONLY TWO OF ENTRY. NORTH KERN. AND CLOSE THE CAP. INTERNET AND DIRECTING MANY PEOPLE TO THE INTERNET AND RESOURCE EVERYTHING FROM OUR- IN MAKO HOARDING TOWARD TESTING THE STAFF TôI TESTING OF MATES- TO THE CLOSURES OF PROGRAMS. OF THE MOVEMENT BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS. AND THE PROGRAM STATUS OF EVERY INSTITUTION- I BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN AN OVER RELIANCE ON OUR END WE DO NEED TO DEVELOP A MORE. COMPREHENSIVE A COHESIVE. ARGUMENT RATHER THAN REFER EVERYONE TO THE INTERNET- AND- I HAVE BINDER HERE WITH. DIRECTOR TENET AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT WE NEED ALL OF THOSE PUT. ONE DOCUMENT IS OVER REPORT. BUT AS WITH ANY REPORTS ESPECIALLY DURING COLD BUT- IT IS GOING TO BE A REVOLVING REMOVING AND- BUT AS FAR AS- THE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED BY. BY YOUR- BY YOUR COMMITTEE CENTER I DO APPRECIATE A CORRECTIONS IS BETTER FOR IT. BUT I HOPE YOU DO TOO. THE DECISION TO. NOT TAKE JAIL. INMATES ARE ISN'T TAKE A LOT ON OUR- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF HUMAN. WITH OUR WITH OUR SURE PARTNER. AT THE ERROR. NEVER PART IN THIS WHEN THIS THE- THERE WAS A GUIDELINE SENT TO THE SHERIFF'S EARLY EARLY TO MID LAST WEEK YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR DIRECTION. ON WHAT TYPES IT MAKES ARE TO COME TO US WHAT IS YOUR TESTING PROTOCOLS- AND THEY HAVE BEEN GOOD PARTNERS IN IT AND THAT- THAT GREAT YOUR HUSBAND WILL IN COLLABORATION WITH THE RECEIVERS OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THE RECEIVER'S OFFICE IS IN AGREEMENT. THAT THE QUESTIONS OR ASK YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REQUIRING OF THE COUNTIES IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CODE MITIGATION STRATEGIES- BUT- EVEN WITH THAT WITH THE SPIKES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS. I SENT A LETTER TO THE COUNTIES INFORMING THEM THAT WE READ ACTUALLY TELLING OF WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO COSTS AND TAKE FOR ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS. THAT DOES ALLOW US TO. IS NUMBER ONE- TAKE A LOOK AT THE VACANT CAPACITIES IN OUR RESEARCH CENTERS WHICH NOW EXISTS BECAUSE IN RATES ARE NOT COMING IN AT TO STRATEGIZE WITH THE RECEIVERS OPTIONS BE POPULATE OTHER LOCATIONS OR WE MAY HAVE CRISIS AREAS THAT WE CANNOT D. POPULATE OR REDUCE THE DENSITY. INSTITUTIONS AND MOVE INDIVIDUALS AS COHORTS AFTER BEING TESTED IN QUARANTINE AT THE SENDING IN AND ON THE RECEIVING END- SO. I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR SENATOR ABOUT THE OVERALL PLAN THE WHEEL FINANCE IN THE FINANCE OWES YOU. BUT AGAIN I WILL CHALK IT AND I WILL SAY THAT IT'S BEEN AN OVER RELIANCE ON. ON OUR INTERNET AND POSTING. ALL THAT THE VARIOUS PLANS THAT ARE SO. ON THAT WHAT'S- THE THING RESPONSE ON AND I'LL IN NOW ON THAT I'M CHAIRWOMAN YOU KNOW ON THE MANY MEMBERS ARE OFTEN CONCERNED ABOUT UNFUNDED MANDATES ACTIONS WE TAKE IT THE LEGISLATURE THAT HAVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LET ME COULD BE CLEAR. THAT WE HAVE PAID WE HAVE. PAID FOR. STOPPING THE INTAKE FROM THE COUNTY LEVEL SO THEY HAVE RECEIVED REIMBURSEMENT. ALL AND WITH THE SECRETARY- I'M NOT SURE OF THE SOURCE OF THE MISTAKE LET ME JUST STATE THAT. BOMB IN THE STAFF BRIEFING WITH FINANCE. WE WERE TOLD SEVEN HUNDRED PER WEEK. AND WHEN STAFF RETURN THE CALL TO CLARIFY THAT THEY DID MEAN SEVEN HUNDRED A MONTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REITERATED A SECOND TIME. THE INTENT WAS TO TRANSFER ME USING YOUR TERMINOLOGY INTAKE. WAS TO PICK BACK UP. AT SEVEN HUNDRED PER WEEK. SOUL IF FINANCE IN COORDINATING WITH THE AGENCY. PROBLEM AND SO- I APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY AND I HOPE THAT THE THAT YOU ARE CLEAR THAT IF YOU'RE A WOMAN AND THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS HIGH AS DEAL BE FEE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THESE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE WE ARE NOW AT A- POINT OF CRISIS. AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT MUST STEP IN- IT IS SYSTEM WHY- IT CLEARLY WILL HAVE FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS ON THE STATE AS A WHOLE. ALL ON THE QUICKER YOU HAVE A PLAN WHERE YOU CAN WRAP UP WERE MISTER KELSO HAS THE RESOURCES AND PERSONNEL HE MADE NEEDS TO CONDUCT TESTING THE BETTER OFF WE WILL ALL BE INCLUDE. WHO ARE CAR SERRATED. THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SECTOR DS RESPONDING BUT LET ME JUST ADD TO THE SENATOR MITCHELL'S. HAS BEEN HER ROLE OF CHAIR OF L. JAIL BC. FIVE COURSES A MEMBER OF JAIL BC CUT TO RECEIVE EACH OF THOSE LETTERS THAT WERE SENT. AND I JUST WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT I DON'T THINK WAS ANSWERED. THAT AS FAR AS I KNOW BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A RESPONSE THAT NONE OF THE REQUESTS. THAT SENATOR MITCHELL THAT THE JAILED BC SENT. EACH TIME THE JAIL BC AUTHORIZED THE EXPENDITURES THAT THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION WERE NEVER RESPONDED TO SO WHILE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN THINGS ON A CDC OUR WEBSITE. THERE WAS NEVER A FORMAL COMMUNICATION THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE CDC OUR WEBSITE TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS THERE CERTAINLY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME OF US WHO HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE CDC HERE ARE WEBSITE ALL THIS TIME. FOR EXAMPLE I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CITE THE DATE JUST CITED BEFORE AROUND AND THE NUMBER THE STAFF AT WHAT FACILITIES AND THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE FACILITIES ALL OF THAT IS RIGHT THERE ON THE CDC OUR WEBSITE. BUT I THINK- AND I RUBIO. SENATOR MITCHELL'S POINTING OUT THAT JAIL BC HAS BEEN REQUESTING THIS INFORMATION AND OUT THE NEXT THE FOR PLANNED FOR MONTHS. AND WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT. SENATOR WIENER I WANT TO ASK ONE QUESTION BEFORE I CALLING YOU SO APOLOGIES- MR KELSO IN SECTOR YEARS YOU CAN RESPOND ALSO TO MR CALL SO YOU MENTIONED THAT. AND I A PRIEST A SENATOR MITCHELL'S. HAVING CLEARED BY THE AUTHORITY OF YOUR ROLE BUT YOU MENTIONED THAT GUIDANCE WAS GIVEN STARTING WITH MARCH TWENTIETH AND ON VARIOUS GUIDANCE. AND MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHILE IT'S NOT BEEN SAID YET BY SECRETARY DEUS. IN THE CALLS THAT I'VE HAD WITH THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE LAST X. NUMBER OF MONTHS THERE WAS A CERTAIN POINT WERE I WAS INFORMED. THAT SYSTEM WIDE THERE WAS THE REQUIREMENT FOR STAFF TO WEAR MASKS. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHETHER IN FACT THERE WAS THAT REQUIREMENT WHETHER THE RECEIVER WAS INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT REQUIREMENT WAS EITHER ISSUED AN ENFORCED AND FROM CDC ARE WAS THAT REQUIREMENT ENFORCED. THAT ALL STAFF WEAR MASKS. BECAUSE ANECDOTALLY WHAT WE HEAR IS THAT STAFF. DO NOT WEAR MASKS SOME BUT IT'S IRREGULAR AND- SO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. YOUR MANAGER THE- I'LL I'LL GIVE AN ANSWER I SUSPECT SECRETARY DEALS WANTED AMPLIFIED- BOTH SECRETARY DIAZ NINE HAVE. ISSUED DIRECTIVES THAT STAFF- SHOW WEAR MASKS- WE DON'T TWICE- I ALSO- BECAUSE WE HEARD SIMILAR SORTS OF CONCERNS THAT WELL WE KNOW PEOPLE WEARING MASKS AND IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT THAT GUY. WEAR MASKS AND ABSORB DISTANCE I SENT OUT FROM MY OFFICE. HE. FIFTEEN FIFTEEN DIFFERENT OF. THE ONES THOUGHT WE MOST CRITICAL OR REVIEW. UP WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GETTING REPORT BACK ON HOW WELL ARE BOLD INMATES AND STAFF DOING IN COMPLYING WITH THOSE DIRECTIVES FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING MASKS SO ON- AND I DID RECEIVE A REPORT. BACK LAST WEEK. SOME HUNDRED AND SIXTY PAGES WORTH OF DETAIL ABOUT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE- IT IS NOT UNIFORM- IN GENERAL- IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS ONLY ON ONE PRISON. WHERE THE REPORT DESCRIBED THE PRISON AND WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GO TO NOT TAKING. THIS LAND OFF OVER. REPRESENT WHAT SEE I AM. SURPRISINGLY I DON'T SEE HOW THEY COULD NOT BE TAKING IT SERIOUSLY GIVEN THE EXTENT OF THE OUTBREAK THERE. BOB FOR ALL OF THE OTHER PRISONS THE REPORT CAME BACK THAT IT WAS BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY- WE'VE HAD GREAT COOPERATION- WITH THE INMATE ADVISORY COUNCILS AND INMATES IN GENERAL- THEIR OBSERVANT AND MOST INSTITUTIONS. WE HAVE SOME INMATES WHO ARE COMPLIANT DON'T COMPLY WITH MUCH OF ANYTHING BUT BY AND LARGE I THINK WE'RE DOING. PRETTY WELL- WE INDICATED IN OUR MOST A CERTAIN RADIUS MINOR MOST RECENT MA'AM ALL THAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INSTITUTION LEADERSHIP. TO ENFORCE THE REQUIREMENT OF USING. OF THE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE SYSTEM. SO I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS BY BEING ENFORCED ON OBSERVER. A JUDGE I GOT MY DAY IN MY- HI HE DESERVES NOT US ALONG EARLIER THIS WEEK- AND HIT THE REPORT I RECEIVED BACK DRUGS FIRE WAS IT LOOKED AT HIM LIKE PEOPLE WERE IN GENERAL COMPLYING WITH ALL SORT OF A- MUCH. THIRTY ALSO. SO I GOT TO BUY WHAT OF MISTER CASTLE SAID IT IS A REQUIREMENT WHEN WAS THE REQUIREMENT ISSUE- I COULD GIVE YOU THE DATES THAT HAD OPENED AROUND LATE MARCH. MARCH BUT THAT WE JUST SIGNED ANOTHER MEMBER AND LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO AMPLIFYING AND REITERATING THE NEED FOR MASKS I ALSO DID- THE REQUIREMENT REQUIREMENTS. IT IS WE ARE THAT STUFF MASS AND LIKE LIKE MISTER COUNSELL SENATE UP I ALSO WANTED TOWARD PRISONS MYSELF- DURING THE- IT WAS LAST MONTH I DROVE. JUST ON THE CALIFORNIA DIDN'T BLAME MYSELF DROVE. YES TO NUMBER ONE CHECK ON THE STATUS OF THE INSTITUTIONS BUT TO ALSO LOOK AT MYSELF. FOR THE COMPLIANCE OF MASS WHERE. SEVEN INSTITUTIONS THAT I TOUR- STAFF WERE IN COMPLIANCE AND I KNOW THERE ARE TIMES WHEN STAFF KNOW THE SECRETARIES ARE STILL OF COURSE YOU CAN BEHIND AWARENESS I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT. BOB THAT'S WHY. YEAH WHICH IS NOT JUST LOOK AT WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF ME WHAT WAS BEHIND ME AND YARDS NEXT TO ME. THE DOCTOR IN MAKES STAFF. AND COMPLIANCE IS MANDATORY. WE HAVE CMMUNICATED THIS ITH THE BARGAINING UNITS THE BARGAINING UNITS. ARE ARE ON BOARD OF THE BARGAINING UNITS HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. THEY KNOW IT IT BENEFITS MEMBERSHIP. AND THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IF PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE MASSIVE TAKEN ON WHAT WE USED TO. FAILED TO COMPLY OR DON'T COMPLY- NOT UNDERSTANDING. THIS REQUIREMENT NOT ONLY BY. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS MIGHT KEEPERS OFFICE- BUT IT'S JST THE RIGHT THING TO DO AT THE STATE. THANK YOU SIR- SENATOR WIENER IN I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR QUESTION FOR US AND I SOME QUESTIONS FOR SECRETARY DHEAS ABOUT I'D AS I MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING TRANSFER OF. PEOPLE FROM CITY CHARTER DETENTION FACILITIES BUT ONE QUICK QUESTION BEFORE THAT- I'VE GOTTEN SOME FEEDBACK. THAT THERE ARE- THE STAFF FOR MEDICAL STAFF CONCERN CORPS AND MAY NOT HAVE THE P. P. THAT NEEDED CAN YOU COMMENT ON LEVEL. I CAN GIVE YOU. I GET AN UPDATE ON A ON A DAILY BASIS FROM OUR LOGISTICS OFFICE IN OUR DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTER- JAN NINETY FIVE MASS CURRENTLY WE HAVE- ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND SURGICAL MASK OVER FIVE MILLION AND NINETY FIVE MAX TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND. OVER HALF A MILLION DOWN. OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. SHIELDS AND WE HAVE OVER TEN MILLION PAIRS OF GLOVES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF CODE RED A CDC ARE OF THE DEPARTMENT'S OPERATIONS CENTER THE RECEIVER'S OFFICE WE SEE NEARLY THIRTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON PP FOR EMPLOYEES. I THINK ONE COVERED FIRST. THAT'S MY OF THE STATE WHERE THERE WAS STRONG TO TRY AND FIND THAT SUPPLIER BUT SINCE THEN WE HAVE RAMPED UP IF THERE ARE CONCERNS AT. THANK EP IT'S REPORTED UP THE INSTITUTIONS THE MORE OPERATIONS CENTER HERE AND WE ADDRESS- I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT THERE IS A LACK BUT IF THERE IS WE WILL BE LESS. WIENER I JUST WANT TO SAY I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS A LACK OF PP AT SAN QUENTIN FROM STAFF IT'S IN COURT. FOR ITS- MAY LOOK INTO THAT TO CONFIRM BECAUSE MORE HEARING BEST FROM FROM REAL WORLD SOURCES. ON THE REGARDING ICE TRANSFERS- SO- SECRETARY DEUS EX SO I WANT TO KNOW. SINCE THE BEGINNING YOU. HOW MANY. IT IS OUR TRANS TO OUR TO TEN BUT AND HAS THE DEPARTMENT BEEN TRACKING- WHETHER THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO ICE DETENTION pFACILITIES WHERE WE KNOW THAT CODE IS SPREADING DATA WE'VE GOT AND IS A ONE OUT OF THREE- INDIVIDUALS IN THESE DETENTION FACILITIES. IS POPULAR SO. BROWN'S ARE YOU TRYING WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO FACILITY THAT HAVE COVERED ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR. SO AS FAR AS THE NUMBER I WILL HAVE TO GET THAT TO YOU FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR I CAN PROBABLY GET IT BY THE END OF THE DAY. BUT I WILL SAY ONE WAS IN THE TERM TRANSFER WE DON'T WE THE CDC OUR- TRANSPORT ME IN MY TO SEE TO ASK CITY. IF IT MITCHELL SERVE THEIR TERMS AND THEIR TERM IS UP. IT IS A RESULT WARRANT BY I USED AS A UP WE- PICKED UP BY I JUST LIKE. ANY OTHER LAW AGENCIES WHO MADE ALL THE VISUAL THE TAKEN. FOR OUR. CUSTOMERS SOMEONE LEAVES OUR PRISONS BACK OF UP IT'S OVER IF PRICES. WE TRANSPORTING- OR SOME OTHERS USE YOUR HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE TRANSPORT- IT'S AUDIBLE BROWN BUT SORT OF OUR PURVIEW OF THE MINISTER SENTENCE IN THEIR DOMINANCE HALT. REJECTED AND CUSTODY WATER PICKS THEM UP. MY AYE AYES SO I UNDER IS YOU ABOUT THE ONE DURING THE FIFTH TRANSPORT. BOB MY UNDERSTANDING IS- CCAR INFORMS ICE I THINK FIVE DAYS BEFORE RELEASE ABOUT TELL IT SNOWS TO PICK SOMEONE UP WHEN THEY'RE BUILT THE RELEASE OF CITY SEE ARE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. THIS INVOLVED AND- ON A CALL TO TRANSFER HAND OFF FROM CITY SITAR TO ICE OF PEOPLE WHO'VE COMPLETED- THEIR CITY YARD SENTENCE OR WHO ARE BEING RELEASE OR PAROLED- AND CITY ARE FACILITATE SOME BEING PICKED UP UPON THE RELEASE AND THEN TO TURN AYE SUSPENSION. ALREADY THE ARE OP YOUR SENSE COVERT BECOME A THERE ARE REAL MAJOR ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA LET'S SAY STARTING IN MARCH HAS CDC ARE CONTINUE TO DO THAT TO FACILITATE ICE PICKING UP THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING RELEASED AND A CITY SEE OUR- LOOK INTO. THEY'RE BEING SERVICEABILITY WITH A COMMON PROBLEM IS THAT HAPPENING. SO RICOH RID- AND CURRENT CODE IF THERE IS A HOLDING PLACE GIVEN BY ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY WHETHER BE ICE WHETHER BE LOS ANGELES SURE FOR THERE TO BE A GEORGIA AND NOT HOLD IS IN PLACE. AND THEY'RE THERE TO PICK THEM UP THEN WE RELEASE UNDER THEIR CUSTODY AFTER THEY'RE OUT OF OUR CUSTODY WE DON'T- WE'RE NOT CHECK FOR THEY GO. OR NOT CHECKING THE STATUS OF WOMEN GOING TO THEY ARE NOW IN THE CARE CUSTODY OF THE OF THE ENTITY PICKING THEM UP. SO BY. IT I AM I CORRECT THIS ARE DOES NOT AN OBLIGATION. TO ALERT ICE AND TO FACILITATE THE HAND OFF THE EYES OF THESE THE DETAINEES ARE YOU ARE YOU. YOU'RE NOT OBLIGATED TO DO THAT CITIES ARE IS CHOOSING TO DO THAT. GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW. ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE PRIVATE PRISON ICE DETENTION FACILITIES. OVERHEAD WHY IS CC ARE CONTINUING TO ALERT ICE THE PEOPLE ARE BEING RELEASED- AND TO FACILITATE. THE HAND OFF WHY ARE YOU STILL DOING THAT AND WILL WILL WILL YOU WILL YOU STOP. I THINK CITY SORRY TO STOP. DOING THAT. OKAY SO AS WITH ALL HOLDS THERE IS CONTACT MADE WITH THE ENTITY THE INITIALLY PLACED A WHOLE TO INQUIRE ARE YOU GOING TO PICK THIS INDIVIDUAL UP OR NOT. QUESTION WHAT AS NOT JUST WILL ANY LAW FORCED AND TO. ARE YOU GOING TO PAY THEM UP. BUT THEY SAY WE'RE NOT THERE WILL HOLD AND THEY JUST HOME. IF THEY SAY THEY ARE LOOKING NO WHERE YOU HAVE ALL. SO THEY CAN MAKE THEIR RIGHT COMMUNICATION FAMILY BUT WE NOT ICE JUST WHAT WE WOULD ANY LONG. WHO IS REQUESTING THAT THE GOING TO PICK UP. WE DON'T HAVE ICE ANY AS WE WOULD ANY OTHER LAFORTUNE. AND IF THERE IS A HOLDING PLACE AND- WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE. BUT I GUESS. THE QUESTION IS WHY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TREAT THIS LIKE ANY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. AND FRANKLY ICE IS NOT LIKE. OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE KNOW ALL THE PROBLEMS OF ICE. GOING WELL BEYOND COVE IT IN TERMS OF HOW THEY TREAT. IMMIGRANTS IN THESE DETENTION FACILITIES. AND THE PROBLEM. PEOPLE DOT. ABOUT WITH THE WAVE LGBT Q. IMMIGRANTS ARE TREATED TREATED IN CHILDREN. AND THEN WE HAVE COBIT WERE ONCE AGAIN THE- DONE A TERRIBLE JOB. AND SO FIFTY C. R. IS NOT REQUIRED. TO CORDON QUE AND FACILITATE. ARE YOU STICKING HIS PEOPLE UP YOU'RE CHOOSING VOLUNTARILY TO DO SO. AND SO MY QUESTION IS WHY ARE YOU CHOOSING TO VOLUNTARILY DO SO. AND WILL CDC ARE COMMITTED TO STOP DOING THIS THIS IS MAKING THE COVERT SITUATION IT'S HARMING PEOPLE WILL YOU STOP DOING. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW OUR POLICY STATE. HOLDING PLACE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY INCLUDING THE X. FOR A HOLDEN PLACE TO TURN OVER TO THE CUSTOMER. OKAY LIFE IS ONE OF INCLUDE BY SAYING I. COULD NIGHT THE THREE WITH CDC OURS INVOLUNTARY POLICY. TO HAND PEOPLE OFF THE ICE A COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE. WE THIS IS THIS IS MAKING THE COVERED SITUATION WORSE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN CLICK HERE. WITH THE PASSAGE OF US FIFTY FOUR THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO. OFFICE TATE. THE TRUMP DEPORTATION MACHINE- AND EVEN THOUGH YES THE GOVERNOR DID VETO AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WEST HEREBY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO THE MISTAKE AND I HOPE THAT THIS MISTAKE OF QUICKLY RECTIFIED AND STOP. FOR NINETY DAYS. SENATOR MOORLACH.

NO I THINK THE RECEIVERS PARTNERSHIP WITH CDC ARE IT IS VALUE AT OTHERS EXPERTISE THAT DOES EXIST IN THE RECEIVER'S OFFICE THAT. THAT SEEKS YOUR RELIES HEAVILY ON. AND THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE RECEIVER ESPECIALLY MISTER CALDERON MYSELF AND STRONGER NOW THAN EVER.

WELL AS A THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION- AS YOU KNOW- MY COURT HAS DIRECTED ME FOR ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS NOW NOT TO TRY TO PUT A- FIRM DATE. ON ENDING RECEIVERSHIP WHAT I CAN SAY IS. YOUR MAKING STEADY PROGRESS FORWARD IN THE DELEGATION PROCESS WHICH IS THE PROCESS A TO END THE RECEIVERSHIP. ESSENTIALLY WHEN COVERT TRUCK I HAVE NOW AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE LAST FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS ON WHAT ARE THE NEXT SET OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE READY FOR DELEGATION AND FOR I THINK THERE ARE. A NUMBER THAT ARE READY FOR DELEGATION THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN DELEGATED I'M HOPING OVER THE NEXT. MOTHER TO A TO FIGURE OUT HOW I CAN REORGANIZE MY OWN ATTENTION SO THAT I CAN GET BACK TO THE PROCESS NOT ONLY OF WORKING WITH SOUND SECRETARY DEALS ON COVERT MATTERS WHICH I THINK OF A HIGH PRIORITY. BUT SO THAT I CAN CONTINUE THE PROCESS DELEGATING BACK DATE MOVING THE CASE ALONG TOWARD ITS CONCLUSION SO- MOB BUT WE DON'T HOLD IN TERMS OF THAT PROGRESS. FOR FIVE MONTHS NOW BUT I HOPE TO GET BACK TO IT. THANK YOU WERE KELSO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER MORE LIKE SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAD A QUESTION FOR SECRETARY DHEAS AS RELATES TO PERSONNEL STAFFING IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION I PARTICIPATED IN A CALL. A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO WITH ONE OF YOUR FACILITIES INTO WHICH BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION ALONG WITH THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY. A PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THE SOME THE FACILITIES ARE LACKING MEDICAL DIRECTORS OR IF THEY DO HAPPEN COULD DIRECTOR THERE AN ACTING CAPACITY BEYOND THEIR SKILL START IS THAT STILL THE- BUT THE QUESTION IF- BETTER RECTOR. MEANING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OVER HEALTH CARE- THAT IS- THAT'S MORE IN LINE OF A QUESTION FOR MR KELSO. ACTOR AT EACH FACILITY AT EACH FACILITIES FACILITY HAS A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHO IS OVER HEALTH CARE- THEIR EQUIVALENT TO OUR WARDENS AT THE INSTITUTION OKAY AS A RACE TO HEALTH CARE MATTERS TO MISTER KELSO THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR THE- WE DO HAVE. SOME OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF ACTING C. E. O.'S MOST OF OUR C. E. O.'S. I HAVE BEEN WITH US NOW FOR MANY YEARS FRANKLY AND THEY ARE VERY EXPERIENCED- GROUP. OF HEALTH CARE USUALLY HOSPITAL FORMER HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS- UNDERSTAND VERY WELL HOW TO MANAGE A STAFF OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS- IN THE STATE WE HAVE ACTING IS BECAUSE- PEOPLE RETIRE THEY DECIDE THEY'RE- NOT FROM MOM. AND WE HAVE WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN A PROCESS OF RECRUITING. FOR CEOS AND FOR CHIEF MEDICAL EXECUTIVES- BECAUSE WE HAVE VACANCIES WE NEED TO HAVE A POOL OF PEOPLE CHOOSE FROM. IT YOU HAVE. YOUR INSTITUTION CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLEASE DO FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME- AND I CAN RESPOND MORE PRECISELY BUT BY AND LARGE OUR C. E. O.'S ALL OF OUR POSITIONS THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR POSITIONS ARE FILLED WITH. A PERMANENT- EXPERIENCE LEADERSHIP. BE BECAUSE IT AGAIN AT. CALL THAT I RECEIVED ALONG WITH THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THEY HAD PEOPLE AN ACTING CAPACITY BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN THEIR SKILL SET NOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT UNDERSTANDING BUT IT WASN'T SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATED TO HEALTH CARE AND ADDRESSING THIS CALL THE- ISSUE. THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD I WANT TO- MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT ONE O'CLOCK TODAY AND WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC ALSO. BUT BEFORE WE DO. I WANTED TWO THINGS ONE I APPRECIATE THE HONESTY. MISTER COLE SO IN DESCRIBING. THE ISSUE OF THE TRANSFER HOW YOUR MATRIX HOW YOUR A. B. AS I UNDERSTAND IT WHAT I HEARD WAS THAT THERE WAS THE REQUIREMENT OF TESTING HOWEVER IN NEVER SPECIFIED WHEN. BUT I GUESS WHAT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT. IS IF THERE IS THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AT EACH VISIT. CAN ANYONE UNDERSTANDS AWAY THIS FIRE SPREAD IN YOU KNOW MAY IN MARCH WE DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND AND MAYBE WE DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE TESTING. BUT BY THE END OF MAY WE FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND WE HAD ADEQUATE TESTING SO HOW THERE COULD HAVE BEEN THE TRANSFER. WITH PEOPLE THAT HAD NOT BEEN TESTED FOR TWO TO THREE WEEKS. HEY I JUST IT'S SUPPORT AND I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. I DON'T KNOW REALLY IF THERE'S A COMMENT. TO MAKE OR NOT I JUST HAVE TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE. IS IN THIS IS TO BOTH. MISTER CALDERON SECRETARY DS BUT PERHAPS MISTER KELSO PRIMARILY. AS THE PERSON WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE. VINCENT YOUR GUIDANCE INDICATED THERE'S THE EED FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING PHYSICAL DISTANCING. MENU BIG KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT'S DIFFICULT IN SETTING. AND WE KNOW THAT WE ARE OVERCROWDED. DO YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE RELEASES ENDERS RELEASES DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE BACK TO. DO COMMUNITY SETTING THEY COULD BE AN TO OTHER FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE AND I DON'T MEAN JUST PRISON FACILITIES. BUT I MEAN FACILITY WHERE PEOPLE COULD BE NOT CROWDED COULDN'T COULD OF A FALL AT A FOLLOW THE APPROPRIATE GUIDELINES. ON DO YOU HAVE THAT AUTHORITY AND BEFORE YOU ANSWER I JUST WANT TO SINCE THIS IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT I JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR TO ANY PUBLIC THAT'S LISTENING. THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE FOR TO EVERY SO FAR ALL BEEN RELEASES THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ON THE NATURAL. THE NOW. THREE THOUSAND APPROXIMATELY PEOPLE ARE RELEASED FROM OUR PRISON SYSTEMS EVERY MONTH. SO THAT THE FACT THAT SINCE LATE MARCH WE RELEASE SOME SEVEN THOUSAND IS NOT HIGHLY UNUSUAL AT ALL. SO I GUESS SOMEONE TO IN TERMS OF THIS PLAN FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SPREAD WHETHER THERE IS ANY- PLANNED FOR. RELEASES TO ACCOMMODATE TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE APPROPRIATE FISCAL DISENCHANTMENT THERE. AND THE OTHER GUIDELINES FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAVE PEOPLE AND DORMITORY FACILITIES ARE WE HAVE PEOPLE IN CELLS THAT DON'T TELL A SOUL DOORS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE ISSUE OF OUR RELEASES NEW TO RELEASE IT I HAVE BEEN BEFORE- THE COURTS IN OF THE CASE THE COURTS BEEN HOLDING- HEARINGS ABOUT EVERY SEVEN DAYS FOR A WHILE AND NOW MOST RECENTLY ABOUT EVERY TEN DAYS AND THE QUESTION OF RELEASES IS BEFORE THE COURT- DO NOT BELIEVE I HAVE. AUTHORITY MYSELF TO. ORDER A HOUSING CHANGES OR RELEASES- THAT WOULD PUT- PATIENTS OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION. EXCEPT FOR- ORDERING PATIENTS UP TO GO TO HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE HOSPITALS SO I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE THE POWER. TO DO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU IT WAS A LISTENING TO YOUR QUESTION- I'M I'M REMINDED OF THE NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS AND ACADEMICS WHO ARE AT LEAST IN THE ME IN MY OFFICE THEIR CREATIVE IDEAS CUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ASKING IS THERE ANY MORE I. CREATE ID BOB PARTNER WITH. AGENCIES IN TERMS OF TRANSFER. AND SO ON I'D LIKE TO KNOW- IF. THE SECRETARY WITH THE COUNCIL ARE GETTING THEM IF THERE IS A REPOSITORY WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE SENDING THESE CREATIVE IDEAS TO THEM. ALL MY APPRECIATE THEM COMING TO MY OFFICE BECAUSE OF TODAY'S HEARING. BUT TO GET THEM INTO THE HANDS OF THE KILLER WHO ARE THE DECISION MAKERS IN WHO HAVE. ALBEIT LIMITED POWER TO MAKE FROM LITTLE DEFICIENT HOW WOULD THEY LIKE TO RECEIVE THAT INPUT FROM.INFORMED PEOPLE STAKEHOLDERS ACADEMICS AND OTHERS WHERE SHOULD THEY SEND THEM. SENATOR MITCHELL I'D I'D WELCOME SOME OF THOSE- SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS OR SOME OF THOSE IDEAS WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT VARIOUS OPTIONS- BUT YOU KNOW WITH THE VARIOUS OPTIONS WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP IN MIND. WE NEED TO PUT THE MAIN LOCATION SO WHAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE A MAKE A BAD SITUATION WORSE SITUATION THAT'S NUMBER WE DON'T WANT TO BE DOING- IS OUR- I. CAN SEE. OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE REENTRY SERVICES AFTER INCARCERATION- NEEDS TO NEEDS TO IMPROVE. WE HAVE GOOD PARTNERSHIPS WITH RE ENTRY RE ENTRY SERVICES ARE COMMUNITIES. THE EXPANSION OF THAT IS NOT SHE- AND- BUT IN A WAY THAT IF THERE'S ANY OTHER CREATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE THE USAGE ARE YOU COLLEGE DORMITORIES SO- EMPTY JAILS BUT ALSO BEFORE I WOULD DO THAT I WOULD. I WOULD BE LOW THE EMPTY HOUSE UNITS AT THIS WITHIN CDC ARE. AND MAXIMIZE THOSE A TO REDUCE DENSITY INSTITUTIONS IF I CAN HOUSE INMATES IN EMPTY BUILDINGS. LET'S JUST HONEST CELL. THAT WOULD GET CITY AND I DO HAVE INDEED. IN SYSTEM I JUST BE BUT HOWEVER TO THE NAME OF THE COMPANY ISSUES OF OUR EXISTING. REALLY MINIMIZE THOSE TRANSFERS SO- I'LL STOP THERE I WOULD JUST SAY IT WITH THE SECRETARY GIVEN YOUR WORKLOAD I DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC TO EXPECT THAT WE SHIPPED ALL OF THESE. TO YOU IF YOU IN A FIVE SOMEONE ON YOUR TEAM ARE THE- LOVE. WHO COULD. RECEIVE BEEN COMMUNICATION- WITH THESE STAKEHOLDERS. AGAIN THEY- THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE SEEN ON OUR- AGAIN ALSO ON IT MAY FOCUSED AND WOULD NOT SUGGEST HOMELESSNESS WOULD NOT SUGGEST INTO A SETTING THAT WOULD. UP FOR A PER THE- SUPPORT RESOURCES. OF YOU CAN IDENTIFY WE CAN DIRECTED TO. BOMB I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I THINK THAT BE HELPFUL I THINK NOT NOT I THINK ABOUT IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE MY LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS CHIEF SANDY REPEAT AND SOME LOW SEVENTIES YOU ALL SHE CAN COLLECT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- IT IS JULYFIRST SO THE MONEY THAT WE APPROVED IN THE BUDGET IS AVAILABLE AND THERE WAS A- A CARRY ON OF ADDITIONAL FUNDIN. THAT THE BSE SEE IS ADMINISTERING THAT CAN SUPPORT- COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS THAT PROVIDE. REENTRY BEDS SO- IT I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE INCORPORATED IN WHATEVER PLANT IS BEING BLOCKED. BY BEST CDS YOUR AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WE HAVE ALREADY ALLOCATED FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN DISTRIBUTED YET. BUT THERE MAY BE FOR EXAMPLE. MANY MANY. RE ENTRY ORGANISE AMITY TO MIND THERE'S MANY MANY OTHERS THAT DO PROVIDE REENTRY BEDS AND WHO MAY HAVE A SPACES AND THAT SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY. THAT WAS APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE LOOKED OUT FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN NOW TO THE SECOND PANEL AND I APPRECIATE. A SECRETARY DS YOUR- ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS AND ALSO MISTER KELSO AND PREVIOUSLY ARE- DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REPRESENTATIVES DOCTOR GOLLY AND A MIS FINELLI APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN A ONE TO MOVE ON NOW.

WE'RE LITERALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COVER THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION. SELECT TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE PPVS WHEN I STEP ON INSTITUTIONS THATTHEY DON'T HAVE THEM SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THEM AND WE'RE ABLE TO GIVE YOUR GO TO GIVE THEM TO. THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THIS. WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR. SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHICS THE SIXTEEN PEOPLE AT THE SOCIAL OF ALL. AND HEARD IT. THE SEPARATION OF THERE WERE TWENTY TWO PEOPLE IN DIED IN TO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WERE TWENTY FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO GUIDELINES. I DON'T DIFFERENTIATE TO THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS OF THEIR TO DO ITS JOB NO HUMAN BEING MET FANS LOCALS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN CUSTODY HAVE BROKEN LAW AND NOT BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. TO HUMAN BEINGS THAT FAMILIES LEVELS. WOULD DEMOGRAPHICS OF THESE IN THIS IS THAT THAT THAT PASSED AWAY FROM COAL. UP WITH. WHAT THEY HAVE. PROTECTED OR SAY IT IF THEY IF WERE OLD OVERSEE OR UNDER GOALS ISSUE WITHIN PROTECT AND SAY. IF WE HAD GIVEN THEM RLEASE. IF WE TAKE A MOMENT JUST TO LOOK AT IF POSSIBLE MAYBE REACH OUT TO THE MINORITY LEADER AND LOOK AT THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT IS NOT JUST LOCAL PRODUCE ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHEN I GO BACK TO WIN WHEN NOROVIRUS RAVAGES. CORRECTION FACILITY. IT WAS LIKE JUST YOU JUST HAVE TO FOR TO TAKE ITS COURSE. WRESTLER WHERE WOULD WHAT WAS. HEARD PEOPLE INSIDE THAT IN SOME INSTANCES THERE'S ROBUST CLEANING INSIDE THE FACILITIES MULTIPLE TIMES THEIR SOLDIERS DISTANCING ONLY ONE YOUR ONE BUILDING CAN GO TO YOUR TIME. THERE'S A JOINT EFFORT WITH BOTH STAFF AND PEOPLE IN CUSTODY HER EXACT OPPOSITE OF SOME SORT OF THE SUIT BUT THERE'S NO CLEANING AND SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT. MEDICAL SO I HAVE MIXED MIXED BATCH OF THESE REPORTS FROM PEOPLE THAT I KNOW AND I TRUST. THAT THEY'RE BEING HONEST WITH. THE. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WILL LOOK AT THIS LANCASTER WHICH IS ONE OF THE FIRST INSTITUTIONS THAT OPERATE THEY HAVE ZERO ACTIVE CASES RIGHT NOW WE DID LANCASTER RIGHT TO THE CITY'S EIGHT THE STUDENT DATA SO WE HAVE TO CASES ALL WE DID GREAT RIGHT ORDER- MAKE SURE NO I MEAN MAYBE A COP FORCES TO MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT WATER THIS INSIDER. WHEN LOOKING AT THOSE. IN MAYBE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT LOS.

PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE FREE TO WEAR MASKS WE ARE TO BE OF SERVICE HELP THE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY. AS WELL AS THE STAFF AND SYSTEMS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER LEWIS. SHE THANK THE JUSTIN TO GET LANCASTER IS VERY VERY GOOD ONE. WHEN I. IN I ALSO TAKE NOTICE THAT. I THINK THERE IS A CORRECT PERCEPTION THAT. IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT A WRONG THING FOR PEOPLE TO REACT TO SAN QUENTIN AND CERTAINLY THE NUMBER OF CASES BUT YES THE FACT WE'RE SAN QUENTIN IS LOCATED- DOES GIVE IT MORE ATTENTION THAN SOME OF OUR OTHER FACILITIES BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MANY PEOPLE IN THE LOW TURNOUT STARTED LEGISLATURE'S YOU DESCRIBED WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET ANSWERS AND ON THIS NOW FOR MONTHS IT WAS WE DID. FEEL THE SAME QUENTIN'S VOICE. BUT YEAH WE HAVE THE WHOLE CAN SAY THE HOPE IT THEY'RE NOT NOW TO TRY LIKELY TO GET FULLY CONTROL OF IT LET'S TURN TO JAMES KING FROM THE ELLA BAKER CENTER. GOOD MORNING THANKS TO THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS JANE CAN BE. I WAS RELEASED FROM SAN QUENTIN SIX MONTHS AGO AFTER LIVING THERE FOR SIX AND A HALF YEARS. DURING MY TIME THE QUARANTINES WERE ROUTINE. NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I WASH MY HANDS WAS CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I TOUCH TOO I WAS PROXIMATE TO I NEVER WENT ONE YEAR WITHOUT IN THE COAL. BECAUSE I LIVED IN THE BUILDING WHICH- I AM FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE BUT HOUSE NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED. WE SHARED EIGHTEEN SHOWER HEADS AND TWELVE PAY PHONES THE BUILDING WAS POORLY VENTILATED WE LIVED IN CLOSE QUARTERS THE WINDOWS ARE WELDED SHUT THE SALES HAVE BARS INSTEAD OF DOORS. THE SALES ARE FOR THE WIDE AND ABOUT NINE FEET IN LENGTH AND HAVE TWO PEOPLE LIVING IN. AS WE SPEAK ALL OF THE- EXPERIENCING A SURGEON CORONAVIRUSES. AN INSIDE SAN QUENTIN THE FASTEST GROWING SCHOOL SEARCH HAS GROWN TO OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED ALREADY. I SPEAK TO MY LOVED ONES ON THE INSIDE I HEAR PHYSICAL DISTANCING IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE MEDICAL ALARMS ARE GOING OFF EVERY TEN MINUTES. PEOPLE INCLUDING HOSPITAL WORKERS WERE CLEANING COLD INFECTED SALES ARE BEING DENIED SHOWERS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED HAND SANITIZER SINCE MARCH. MEDICAL STAFF REFUSES TO GIVE THEM ANY UPDATES ON THE OUTBREAK. AND THEY ARE SCARED. THEY SAY MOVING THEM FROM ONE HIGHLY OVERCROWDED PRISON TO ANOTHER IS NOT THE ANSWER. THE ONLY SAFE RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION IS LARGE SCALE RELEASES BUT IN SPITE OF REPORTS TO THE CONTRARY LEASES HAVE ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN. THE BEGINNING A MODIFIED PROGRAM IN MARCH EARNING TIME OFF OF PRISON SENTENCES TO REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING HAS BEEN HALTED. IN PREPARING THESE REMARKS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP THINKING ABOUT MY FRIEND FREDDIE COLE. HE SEVENTY NINE YEARS OLD NUMBER TIMES IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE DIDN'T THINK HE'D SURVIVE THE YEAR BECAUSE HE HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY AND HIS MATES WERE ADJUSTED SEVERAL TIMES. I pA SPOKESWOMAN THE BEGINNING OF JUNE. THE OUTBREAK WAS BEGIN. I HEARD CHAIR IN HIS VOICE. MY DEAR FRIEND ERAGON SIXTY SIX FOUND OUT EARLIER THIS YEAR TO JUST CANCERS RETURNED AND HE WILL I COULD NOT LIVE OUT THE YEAR. THIS WEEK I THOUGHT HE WAS ONE. OF THE MANY WHO TESTED POSITIVE. THINKING OF LINE MORE SIXTY EIGHT. A FRIEND WAS MENTORED HUNDREDS OF OTHERS BOTH INCARCERATED AND AFTER HIS FORTY TWO YEARS IN PRISON. HE CREATE ITSELF- PROGRAMMING THAT IS PREPARED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FOR RELEASE. AND I'M THINKING OF PATRICIA RIGHT A CIW SIXTY NINE AND CHEMOTHERAPY WITH LESS THAN SIX MONTHS TO LIVE ALSO. I SAY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THAT NONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS I'M NAMING FOR ALL SERVING SENTENCES FOR VIOLENT FELONIES ARE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY TODAY. IN EACH OF THESE PEOPLE LIKE SCORES OF OTHERS WE HEAR FROM HAVE FAMILIES THEY CAN RETURN TO IMMEDIATE. RESPONSE TO THE OUTBREAK STANDPOINT HAS MOVED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TO THE WHOLE OR AN OUTSIDE HOSPITAL. IN FAMILY THIS TIME THE WICKER DIMITRIUS MCGEE JUAN CARLOS MASON THE DLC FUENTES AND TOO MANY OTHERS DO NOT KNOW THEIR STATUS FOR EXACT LOCATION. FAMILIES TRY TO GET INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF THEIR LOVED ONE STAFF IS NOT RETURNING EMAILS ARE ANSWERING PHONE CALLS. AND PEOPLE AYE INSIDE I HEAR THAT PLACING THEM IN THE HOLE FOR BEING SICK IS NOT THE ANSWER. NEAR MOVED THEIR PROPERTIES PLACED IN STORAGE AND ARE GIVEN A SHEET A BLANKET IN A BAR SO. THE SALES ARE THEY ARE BEING PLACED IN OUR DIRTY IN A RUSH TO PACK EVERYTHING UP GUARDS ARE LOSING WHAT FEW FAMILY MEMENTOS AND PERSONAL ITEMS. INSIDER CLOUT. NOT THIS COMMITTEES HIGHLIGHTING THE CDC OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH ICE. CDC ARE IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF NEW BOOKINGS FOR EYES FACILITIES. ONE IN THREE PEOPLE TESTED BY AYE AYES HAVE BEEN FOUND POSITIVE FOR THE VIRUS. AT SAN QUENTIN ONE OF THE WORST OUTBREAKS IS A CURRENT ON DEATH ROW WITH FAMILY MEMBERS OF LOVE ONE SOUNDED THE ALARM AT A RECENT TOWN HALL. SANITATION IS NOT BEING PROPERLY ATTENDED TO AND STAFF ARE WORKING OVERTIME IN THE AREA AFTER WORKING OTHER SECTIONS OF THE PRISON. IT'S HEARTBREAKING IN RESPONSE IS TO SET UP SIX TENS AND CREATE A MODEST PLAN TO RELEASE PEOPLE NOT BASED UPON WHO WAS MOST VULNERABLE IT'S NT BASED UPON PRIORITIZING THE ELDERLY IT'S NOT EVEN BASED UPON THE CDC OURS COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT WHO IS LEAST LIKELY TO COMMIT VIOLENCE A RESERVE A- INSTEAD. THEY HAVE A PLAN IS BASED UPON THE CRIME A PERSON COMMITTED EVEN IF IT WERE TWENTY THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO. AND THE FACT THAT A PERSON HAPPENS TO HAVE A RELEASE DATE SOON. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT CDC ARE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE REAL THREAT HERE. I WAS EXCITED TO CENTER TO REQUIRE IS CONVENING AN ALL HANDS ON DECK MEETING TONIGHT I WANT TO OFFER MYSELF AS WELL AS OTHER ADVOCATES AS A RESOURCE TO SHARE REENTRY RESOURCES I WOULD LOVE TO ATTEND TONIGHT. THANKS FOR YOUR IDEAS HAS CREATED A NEW UNIFIED COMMAND CENTER. AND I WOULD REFER TO THAT TEAM THE JUNE FIFTEEN URGENT MEMO BY BERKELEY HEALTH OFFICIALS THEY SAID IF THE INCARCERATION NUMBERS AT SAN QUENTIN ARE NOT REDUCE BY AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT. OUTBREAK WILL OVERWHELM THE ENTIRE BAY AREA. THIS OUTBREAK IS ST CLINTON. LIKE TWO ONCE A CORPORATE C. I. WCCC ARE ATTRIBUTED TO HUMAN ERROR. BUT THOSE OF US WHO HAS SPENT TIME IN SAN QUENTIN NO THE OUTBREAK WAS INEVITABLE. BECAUSE THE CDC OURS COVERT RESPONSE PLAN IS INSUFFICIENT AND FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED. UNTIL WE COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT LARGE SCALE RELEASES ARE NECESSARY FOR THE SAFETY NOT JUST OF THOSE INSIDE BUT THE ENTIRE STATE. THIS PROBLEM WILL NOT GO AWAY IN BOTH INCARCERATED AND NON INCARCERATED PEOPLE WILL DIE. THANK YOU. MISTER KING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR A HEARTFELT AND ACCURATE REMARKS NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM- GLENN STALEY WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF OUR CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION ONE OF THE- STAFF ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING STAFF AT THE AT OUR CDC OUR FACILITIES ACTUALLY THE LARGEST GO AHEAD MISTER STALEY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. BUT ONCE DALY CCPOA STATE PRESIDENT I'M BLESSED REPRESENT THIRTY THOUSAND THE HARDEST WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN CORRECTIONS AND PAROLE. I LIKE TO START OFF BY STATING HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU HOLDING THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING THIS MORNING LIKE THE REST OF WORLD IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TIME FOR MEMBERS. OUR EXPERIENCE. HAS BEEN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING AS CIRCUMSTANCES ARE EVER CHANGING. YEAH WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO PROBABLY DOUBT BY MAKING SURE MEMBERS UNNECESSARY INFORMATION THE P. ANYTHING ELSE THEY MAY NEED TO CONTINUE TO FILL CITY FROM PROVIDING AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS BEEN HELLISH EXPERIENCE FOR MEMBERS AS IS TAKING A CERTAIN LEVEL OF BRAVERY AND COURAGE TO DO THE WORK WE DO EVERY DAY. AS WE SEEM TO OVER NINETEEN TAKES ITS COURSE OVER TIME. WE WITNESS STRESS LEVELS ANXIETY. FEAR INCREASED AMOUNTS ARE RAINS THESE CONDITIONS ARE ACTUALLY SO SHOULD WITH OUR JOB DUTIES. BUT THE FEAR SPACE. YOUR IT DERIVES THE WORRY OF BRING IN THIS DISEASE HOME TO OUR FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES AS A RESULT THIS IS SITUATION. THE MEASURE TO BE PROACTIVE IN KEEP IN THE MEMBER SAVE. IN ITS EARLY ONSET THE MEDIA GDC R. A C. H. C. S. WAS RELEASING INFORMATION THAT WAS NOT ALWAYS PERFECTLY ALIGNED. IS CONFLICTING INFORMATION LET TERM MEMBERS TO BE I'M SURE OF THE VITAL FACTORS SUCH AS WEATHER IN OCTOBER NINETEEN. WAS AN AIRBORNE OR DROP A TRANSMISSION HOW LONG THE VIRUS LAOS WHETHER OR NOT MASS PROTECTION WAS NECESSARY. I NEEDED TO BE QUARANTINE AND THE MOST SUITABLE WEIGHT SOCIAL DISTANCE IN A PRISON SETTING. AS AN EXAMPLE A DISCREPANT INFORMATION WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE FACILITIES ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF ISSUES YET IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY VARYING WAYS WHICH HAS LED TO DO AS FAR RIGHT WELL YOU'RE BASIS WE DO TAKE THE- YEAH WE CAN CALL. DE IN HIS MANAGEMENT JUDGE CERTAIN POLICY ALSO LIKE TO STRESS THE FACT THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. CONCLUSION WE WANT OUR MEMBERS TO HAVE A SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT. THIS REQUIRES A BETTER DECISION MAKING FROM THE DEPARTMENT THE CHECKER WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSFERS. THERE'S BEEN MISCONCEPTION THAT WE BELIEVE CO IN NINETEEN. IS NOTHING MORE THAN A HOAX OR SOME MADE UP CONSPIRACY. I WANT TO MAKE. WRONG STATEMENT AS SAYS THAT'S NOT THE CASE WE HAVE SPENT OVER A MILLION DOLLARS ON P. T. OUR MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. I ALONG WITH MORE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBERS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF UP AND DOWN THE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA TO PERSONALLY DELIVER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THE RECEIVERSHIP INSPECTOR DHEAS NEUROLOGISTS THAT OUR OFFICERS HAVE BEEN WEARING THE MASK AND TO SAY OTHERWISE IS A MISCALCULATION. FRANKLY INSULTING MY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS A CRACK OFFICER THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME WHERE ON THE WHOLE OFFICER IMMEDIATE NEEDS. SURE THE COMMON THREAD. HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF OUR OFFICERS ARE PRIORITY. BUT WE NEED TO ENSURE THE WELL BEING OF EVERYONE IN THE INSTITUTION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATORS IN TO RECONCILE THESE ISSUES AND WITH THAT I'LL BE HAPPY TAKING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER SEARS- I THINK WE'LL HEAR FROM THE DOCTOR AND THEN I'M SURE SOME MEMBERS WILL HAVE QUESTIONS APPRECIATE I MEAN MISTER STALEY SORRY- APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION TEST. BUT IF YOU GO NOW TO DOCTOR SEARS WHO IS- AS I MENTIONED AT UCSF DOCTOR IN PART OF THE GROUP CALLED AMEND AND WHO IS- ASKED BY THE RECEIVER TO GO TO- SAN QUENTIN. AND I BELIEVE IT WAS ON JUNE- MID JUNE THEY RELEASED THEIR- AIR RECOMMEND REPORT THEIR OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS SO DOCTOR SEARS. I'M CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO MAKE A STATEMENT ON THE TRAGEDY HOLDING STATE PERSON. I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE BUT I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE ALREADY UNDERSTANDS NOT THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL KOBE NINETEEN IN CALIFORNIA UNTIL WE ADDRESS WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE PRISONS AND JAILS. YOUR AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A MAN YES. MEN'S CLOTHING CALIFORNIA PRISONS PROGRAM COMPRISES ACADEMICS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WITH EXPERTISE INFECTIOUS DISEASES GERIATRICS PUBLIC HEALTH. HEALTH SYSTEMS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY FROM UCSF UC BERKELEY. IS IT SAN QUENTIN ON JUNE THIRTEENTH AT THE REQUEST OF THE FEDERAL RECEIVER'S OFFICE AT THE TIME THERE KNOWN CASE COUNT WAS SIXTEEN. BASED ON OUR VISIT AND HOW THE OUTBREAK IS INVOLVED SINCE THEN WE MAKE THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HOW TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO KOBE TEEN IN PRISONS. IS ANSWER IT TO THE GRAVE THREAT. FIRST DEVELOP A CENTRALIZED COVER NINETEEN OUTBREAK EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM I WILL SAY THAT I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THIS IS URGENTLY BEING CREATED AND I HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TEAM THIS TEAM SORTIE TO MAKE PUBLIC HEALTH BASED DECISIONS IN. IT SHOULD WORK IN THE BODY DIRT BOND TO AN OUTBREAK PRISONS WITHOUT BRAKES NEED A DEDICATED EXPERIENCE ALL TIME TEAM WITH KNOWLEDGE OF CORRECTIONAL HEALTH AND SPECIFIC EXPERTISE. ORDER TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES THAT BEEN FOUND THIS TEAM SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING POSITIONS NUMBER ONE. ENVIRONMENT KERRY LEAD OPTIMIZES VENTILATION SANITATION AND PATIENT FLOW IN THE PRESENT TO MITIGATE CODED NINETEEN SPREAD THROUGH. AGAINST INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES NUMBER TWO HEALTH CARE CUSTODY COORDINATION. ORDERS WITH CUSTODY TO ASSESS ON A DAILY BASIS HOUSING AND RESIDENCE FOR MEDICAL ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE MEDICAL LEADERSHIP. VERSE THREE KOBE TESTING LEAD TO COORDINATE TESTING OF ALL RESIDENTS HEALTH CARE STAFF IN CUSTODY IN WHO INSURES RAPID TESTING TURN AROUND TIME. NUMBER FOUR A STAFF HEALTH CARE LIAISON LEAD TO COHORT STAFF AND TRAIN APPROPRIATE PP USE IN INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES NUMBER FIVE IN ACADEMIA ALL JUST ANALYST WHO TRACKS IN REVIEWS LINE LISTING OF ACTIVE AND RESOLVED CASES. SEC RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE URGENT A KERR SERRATION TO ADDRESS OVERCROWDING THIS IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL IT SEEMED QUINN IN ANY PRISON PREFERENTIALLY HOUSES AGING AND MEDICALLY COMPLEX PATIENTS SUCH TO CALIFORNIA MEDICAL COOLEY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FACILITY. WHAT RECOMMENDED THE PRISON POPULATION POINT B. URGENTLY REDUCE TO AT LEAST 50% OF THE CURRENT CAPACITY. FRANKLY IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW RESIDENTS AND STAFF CAN SAFELY CONTINUE LIVING WORKING IN SAN QUENTIN AT ALL. THAT SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT MAY HAVE UNIQUE OWN ABILITIES TO CONVERSATION IS FOUNDATIONAL TO CALL THE NINETEEN MEDICATION ANY PRESENT. ALL REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY DEPENDENT UPON G. CAR SERRATION. SIX REALLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS EVERY TIME YOU HEAR THE WORDS ACCORDING I SAW. CORD ALL OF THAT SHOULD LEAD TO YOU THINKING THE QUESTION OF HOW AND HOW TO DO THAT CONTROLS THE CAR SITUATION. OR EIGHTEEN ISOLATION OF PATIENTS THE TANK NGUYEN IN ANY PRISON IS LIKE A DELICATE CAME. CALIFORNIA PRISONS ARE ALREADY OVER 1100% CAPACITY EVERY SQUARE AND THAT TRANSPORT HAS ONE OR TWO PIECES ALREADY ON IT. THIS MAKES DISTRICT MOVEMENT OF RESIDENTS NEARLY AND HOW. AS A RESULT WE MUST KEEP POPULATE ALL OF OUR PRISONS MEDIA WE HAVE ANY HOPE OF WINNING. WHAT IS HAPPENED IT'S- HOW. OTHER THE FOUNDATION OF COAL NINETEEN MITIGATION THE CAN. DIFFICULT DISTANCING CASTING TO ISOLATE CASES IN QUARANTINE EXPOSED PEOPLE NONE OF THESE ANY STANDARD PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT SPACE. AS A RESULT RAPIDLY BECAUSE REGION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA PRISONS ISN'T URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE SERRATED CORRECTIONAL STAFF. AND OUR COMMUNITIES. THIRD RECOMMENDED IS TO IMMEDIATELY DEVELOP PLANNED TO SUPPORT CAST AND PROTECT DISABILITY STAFF WERE JUST AS VULNERABLE TO INFECTION IN WHO MAY TRANSMIT KOBE NINETEEN. INSIDE THE PRISON AND IN COMMUNITY THE% CURRENT OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH CONTRACT AT SAN QUENTIN DOES NOT ALIGN WITH THE STAFF NEEDS TO THE CORPORATE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CONSEQUENTLY OVER YOUR APARTMENT PUBLIC TESTING COMMUNICATIONS WHICH WE'VE HEARD SOME ABOUT TODAY FOR CONGREGATE SETTINGS DURING AN OPERATE. CASTING ALL STAFF EVERY WEEK. IN ADDITIONALLY OFFICE INSTEAD MUST BE. COLD AT WORK ONLY SPECIFIC HOUSING UNITS OR OTHER PHYSICAL SPACES WITH THE SAME SENSE OF RESIDENTS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF SPREADING QUICKLY NINETEEN WITHIN THE PRISON. SO TO SUMMARIZE WHAT CAN BE DONE NOW AT SAN QUENTIN HANDED PRISONS ACROSS THE STATE. NUMBER ONE IMMEDIATELY CONVENE THIS CALL BUT NINETEEN OUTBREAK REGENCY RESPONSE WITH THE STAFFING THAT I'VE DESCRIBED. TO IMMEDIATELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION RUDY PERSPIRATION. NUMBER THREE. IMPROVE MEASURES TO CAST COHORT. OFFICERS AND STOP. LIKE TO CLOSE BY DESCRIBING WHAT WAS REALLY HAUNTING EXPERIENCES WE LESS SANGUINE AFTER. MEN WORK WE I THINK A LOT DOORS HELP. MY STILL FREQUENTLY HEAR THEM SHOUTING PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP US I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE LOOK OF SHOCK FOR BOATING ON THE FACES OF THE OFFICERS THAT COULD NOT KEEP IN MIND A MATCH. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL TOLD THE OPRY GET SAMPLING WHAT'S TAKEN THE CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE STAFF WORKING THERE. MOST IMPORTANTLY ON THE RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS. FOURTEEN AMEND FURLAN FIRMLY BELIEVES THE PRISONS ARE A REFLECTION OF WHO WE ARE SOCIETY. IS UPON ALL OF US RESPOND IMMEDIATELY. PRO ACTIVELY ADDRESS THIS TRAGEDY TO PREVENT IT FROM UNFOLDING AGAIN AND AGAIN AROUND THE STATE. KING KONG WAS NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO BE TESTED BY KOBE NINETEEN UNFORTUNATELY WON'T BE THE LAST. PLEASE CONTINUE TO CALL IN OUR GROUP THAT AND IF WE CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR SEARS- LET ME SEE IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS. GO AHEAD SENATOR MITCHELL. THE TESTIMONY WAS QUITE COMPELLING ALONG ON WONDER RAIN AND MAYBE IT'S REALLY QUESTION IF YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR OF WHAT WE CAN DO. TO ENCOURAGE REQUIRE THE KIND OF TASK FORCE THAT DOCTOR FEARS DELINEATE DELINEATE DELINEATED IN HIS LIST OF THINGS TO DO IT WAS IT WAS NUMBER ONE SECOND OF COURSE ADDITIONAL SO YEAH I'M NOT PATH. WHAT WHAT CAN. BUT AFFECT CHOICE THAT. THURMAN CHOI IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK THE NUMBER OF US WHILE WHILE OBVIOUSLY IN YOUR LETTERS TO JPL FROM TLC. YOU DID NOT TESTIFIED WHAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE IN THEIR PLAN BUT YOU HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A PLANNED FOR ALL THIS TIME AND WE DIDN'T GET ONE YET NOW IN THE LETTER SO I SENT. I DID TALK ABOUT RELEASE BECAUSE OF JUST THE KNOWLEDGE OF. THE THAT WE KNOW THAT TO CONTAIN THE DISEASE YOU HAVE TO HAVE APPROPRIATE FISCAL DISTANCING AND THAT WOULD THAT WAS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE ACHIEVED IN MANY OF OUR FACILITIES AND WE THOSE WITH LIKES THINGS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THEY HAD INITIALLY THE WORST OUTBREAKS WERE THOSE WITH TYPE OF. THING SO. I KNOW THAT ANY INCIDENT WHAT WE ARE KNOW BECAUSE DOCTOR GOLLY DESCRIBED TO US IS GOING TO BE SET UP WE COULD CONSIDER WHETHER IT'S OUR COMMITTEE OR WHETHER EVEN JBL SEE OR TO- A LETTER THAT- DEAD SPACE. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK MIGHT BE MIGHT NEED TO BE IN THIS PLAN AND THE INCIDENT COMMAND SHOULD DEAL WITH. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I GUESS REALLY MY- AT AND I DON'T FULLY EXPECT TO HAVE THE ANSWER BUT I GUESS MY POINT WAS. WRITING LETTERS HASN'T ANYWHERE RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT. WHICH IS PART IN ANDREAS SEVEN WONDERING YEAH. GOOD POINT IF IT- LET DESPITE OUR I'M I'M YOU KNOW THINKING OUT LOUD WHICH YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO IN A PUBLIC HEARING MADAM CHAIR. BUT WE AT. THING LETTERS ARE NO LONGER WRITER URATE AND SELL IT AND I AGREE AND IT'S BEEN A- I HAVE BEEN A PART OF. FACES WITH YOU AND THE SECRETARY THE ISSUE OF RELIEF FOR YOU HAVE REPEATEDLY REMINDED US ALL RELEASES ARE HAPPY THAT IT HAPPENED. A LEASES THAT WHAT. I PREFER EIGHT ON THE FOCUS ON SAN QUENTIN APPROPRIATELY FELL BUT WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM MR CAL SO ABOUT THE SYSTEM WIDE. SO AT THE END. DOT PIERCING. YOU KNOW STRIKE FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER WORD. TO DEAL WITH THE SYSTEM WIDE. PANDEMIC INTERNAL PANDEMIC ALMOND SO PERHAPS YOU LIKE IN THAT CONVERSATION OFFLINE TALK TO LEADERSHIP TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT NEXT SELECT THANK YOU CAN DO TOM TO COME KATE OUR EXPECTATIONS THANK YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE NIGHT YOU'RE POINTING OUT WANT AN INDOOR. ONE SIX SO I DID IT THE BEGINNING OF THE- THAT YES OR RISER FOCUSED ON SAN QUENTIN HOWEVER. AN END YOU KNOW WE WERE HAPPY TO HEAR OF THE CONTAINMENT AT LANCASTER AND SUCH. BUT JUST THE NATURE OF OUR FACILITIES. THIS COULD HAPPEN IN. AND MY THIS MUST BE DEALT WITH AS A SYSTEM WIDE IT CANNOT BE SOLELY AND ONLY FOR SAN QUENTIN SO I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. THE BASED IN. THE WORK EIGHT ONCE AGAIN. OF BECAUSE OR ARE- PUBLIC SAFETY TRAILER BILL HE'S STILL ON THE TWO WAS NOT PASSED BY THE SECOND HOUSE YET. WE HAVE THE DOZEN STATUTE RIGHT NOW MEDICAL ELDERLY PAROLE. AND NOW WHEN IT WAS DESIGNED IT WASN'T I DON'T THINK WE NECESSARILY THOUGHT OF IT IN RELATIONSHIP. TO TWO PANDEMIC LIKE THIS I THINK THE MIDDLE PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS OBVIOUSLY BUT PART OF THE THINKING AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS DEVELOPED WAS THE FACT THAT OUR PRINTING COSTS. OUR STATE BUDGET FIRST YOUR UP EXPONENTIALLY AND LARGELY DUE TO THE TO THESE LARGE HEALTHCARE COSTS OF THESE VERY MEDICALLY FRAGILE PEOPLE IN VERY ELDERLY PEOPLE AND JUSTICE IN THE REST OF THE POCKET. AND SO THERE WAS THE NET. IF WE COULD X. COULD NOT JUST EXPAND WE HAD NO MEDICAL AN ELDERLY PRO UNTIL THAT STATUTE WAS PASSED. NOW YOU KNOW I'VE NOW ASK IT. THAT STRUCTURE BEEN PAST THERE HAVE BEEN VERY VERY. IT REALLY PAROLED UNDER THOSE. AND HERE WE ARE IN THIS PANDEMIC THAT STATUTE IS STILL AVAILABLE TO CDC ARE IN YET WHEN I PASSED A SECRETARY DS ABOUT IT EXPLICITLY PROX WILLIAM TO GO. TO ME THAT'S THE EIGHT PEOPLE RECOMMENDED BUT WHEN I ASKED HIM FOR THE TIME PERIOD HE SAID IT WAS SEVENTY EIGHT THAT WERE RECOMMENDED BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND NON SITS. DOWN THOSE. VERY FEW WERE ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL ONCE BEFORE THE PROBOARDS AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THE MEDICAL ON THE PEARL DOESN'T JUST LET PEOPLE BE RELEASED THE START TO GO FOR THE PRO ABOARD IN THE PROBE NOT EVEN ACTING. AND CERTAINLY GIVEN THAT WE KNOW. THAT THE DEATH RATE IS HIGHER FOR MEDICALLY FRAGILE AN ELDERLY PEOPLE. THEN IT ONLY MAKES SENSE FOR US TO USE THIS FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO YOU THE STATUTORY TOOLS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN THEM I'M- ALSO. BEEN OUT AND I'M SO I. THE POPE TIME BECAUSE I TO GET TO THEM. BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW IT COST US RIGHT NOW. IN THE INCARCERATED IN TO HOW THEM AND- IF WE WERE TO DO A DEEP BECAUSE OF THIS PUBLIC CRISES. PARK FOR THEM ALL WOULD BE FOR LESS FAR LESS AND WE ALSO HEARD. TIMES ABOUT STAFFING SHORTAGES WHICH SURPRISE ME BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY NUMBER OF STAFF IN OUR. A PRISON SYSTEM IN A CD SURE SO BUT IF IN FACT THERE ARE STARTING SHORTAGES. IN WHAT BETTER TO YOU. THESE TOOLS WE HAVE. DEEP ACOSTA THE HEALTH OF EVERYONE. AND FIGURE OUT HOUSING A DIFFERENT SETTING SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS I THINK ARE SENT BUT BY TOTALLY TO SAN MITCHELL LETTERS ALONE NOW ENOUGH HOPEFULLY AND I DON'T HOPEFULLY I I'M BROKEN HER ABOUT ALL OF IT. AND I. FOR THE IS ICE IN MY STE. THAT STATE. THEY MUST BE. IN PLEASE BEING CURSED IN INDIVIDUALS IN THE CARS IN THE ALL OF US FOR SOME SIDE ABOUT THE PANDA. ARRAY LIMITATIONS ON ALL OF US IN A MAY THOSE TYPES SETTINGS AND THE ONLY OTHER I GUESS ALL ASK THE QUESTION INSTEAD OF JUST IT. BUT IF THREE. IF EITHER IF ANY OF THE PAIN. ONE TWO. WANT TO BE TESTED SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS IF YOU ARE TESTED SO FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN QUENTIN THEN YOU ARE POSITIVE THEN WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN A I'VE HEARD SOME. ARTS OF WHAT WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE YOU'RE PUT IN THE NET THAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO PEOPLE CHOOSING NOT TO BE TESTED BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE IF THERE WAS ANY OF THE PEOPLE. IN THE LAST PANEL WHO COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR. SO THERE COULD BE EITHER MISTER LEWIS MISTER KING. FOR MISTER STALEY. OR DOCTOR SEARS. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR SO I KNOW AND REALLY INSTITUTIONS TESTED POSITIVE WHAT HI I RECEIVED PHONE CALLS WITH THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IF YOU TESTED POSITIVE BE QUARANTINED IN YOUR SO. IF YOU ARE THEY WOULD PUT ON HAPPEN AT SOME STRESS. AND THEN YOU'D BE QUARANTINE JUNIOR YOURSELF KESSLER WE WANT TO YOUR SALE AND THEN WHEN THE RESULTS CAME. IF THEY REMAIN POTS YOU WERE FORM TEAM FORTY DAYS IF YOU IF YOU DID NOT JUST DâN POINTING SO I WILL TAKING I ALSO WANTED TO SHOW. SOMETHING ELSE WITH YOU AND THE COMMITTEE THERE ARE. THINGS WE'VE GOT TO GOVERNOR HOW ABOUT THE POWER OF COMPUTATION THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN GIVEN- LIKE HIGH STANDARDS FROM THE WHARTON EVERYBODY DOWN AT THE SYSTEMS WHICH IS S. MOST A LARGE NUMBER. FIFTY THE INSTITUTIONS THESE PEOPLE ARE GOOD TO GO THERE NOT PUBLIC SAFETY ONLY THING A SUPPLEMENT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN THESE DIFFERENT COMPANIES THAT WON'T PUT UP A FIGHT ONE PERSON SHOULDN'T EVEN BE IN PRISON ONE. OKAY I'M- EIGHT. I DO UNDERSTAND FROM FAMILIES SERVING CORSET INDIVIDUALS THAT MANY. OF THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED- HAVE SEEN THAT THOSE PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE BEING TESTED POSITIVE FOR PUTTING POLITICS AND SUCH AND HAVE A LOT OF FEAR ABOUT THAT SO IT COULD ALL THE THINGS YOU DESCRIBED A MATCH MORE COULD BE CONTRIBUTING TO PAY. FOLKS TO BE TESTED I'VE FOR. MR SO ARE NERVE CC WAY I'M YOU DESCRIBE HAVING TO BUY. THE QUICKNESS BUT BASS. DOES THE DOES FUEL THAT THE STAFF BE GIVEN PROP. CHECK PP PROPER QUIT PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. THANK YOU WELL THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION IN THE BEGINNING I WAS COATED WE HAD.

PAYING ATTENTION. TO LOWER EVERY DAY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WILL APPRECIATE KNOWING IF AT ANY POINT THERE IS THE SENSE THAT THERE'S NOT BEING ADEQUATE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.
