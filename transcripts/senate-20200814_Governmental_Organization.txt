BRING IT BACK TO DISCUSSION- FROM THE MEMBERS OF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. US ASSEMBLY PACIFIC SEVERAL JOBS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I FIVE I THINK THAT THE IDEA AND THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL IS FANTASTIC I BELIEVE THAT- THE STATE OUGHT TO IDENTIFY AS MUCH SURPLUS PROPERTY IS IT CAN AND- AND PUT ON THE MARKET TO MAKE AVAILABLE FOR- WHATEVER PROJECT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THINK IS APPROPRIATE I'M EXCITED ABOUT. THIS LOCAL CITY- AND THIS PROJECT THERE'S JUST ONE SMALL. A BIG PART OF THE BILL THAT IS PROBLEMATIC IN THAT ALLOWS THE STATE TO SELL THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY BELOW FAIR MARKET VALUE- THAT'S A CONCERN FOR ME THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT BELONGS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ASSET BELONGS TO ALL OF THE TAXPAYERS OF THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SURPLUS PROPERTIES TO GET THE HIGHEST VALUE IN THE HIGHEST RETURN FOR THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA HAND SO UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I DO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT AND THE IDEA AND- HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE MORE- CONCEPTS LIKE THIS GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK CENTER AND I ON. IF IT'S A FUNCTION COMES IF THAT ELEMENT OF THE BILL COMES I WILL. BE WILLING TO SUPPORT IT ON THE FLOOR. THAT ARE HUESO. YOU KNOW JUST IN RESPONSE AND. I'M I'VE LOOKING AT THIS BILL GENERALLY WONDERING WHY THEREARE NONE OTHER ASSETS INCLUDED I HAVE ONE OF MY DISTRICT THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO. DEAL WITH THAT. ONLY BE IS A LIABILITY WHERE WE ACTUALLY PUT IT FOR SALE. NOBODY BID. AND IT'S- THE REASON IS IT'S IN A NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY. THAT'S BETWEEN INCRETIN MIDDLE HIGH SCHOOL. AND SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY THIS YEAR COULD SOMEHOW. THE ONLY HAVE THE INSTITUTIONAL ZONING. AND SO- LOOKING TO DEVELOP THEIR- AND SEVEN TRYING ALSO DISCLOSED DISPOSE OF THIS AS PROPERTY OF MY DISTRICT AND I CAN'T. FIND A USE FOR IT- THE SCHOOL IS WILLING TO TAKE. IT OVER AND USE IT TO ENHANCE FEEL. AND THE RED. AND THEY'RE WILLING TO PUT SOME MONEY THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY IT BUT IT'S A VERY DEPRESSED. I KNOW IT'S ON NOT ON THE SUBJECT FISH RELATED MR SHERIFF OF JUST YOU YOU KNOW. ONE SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I WANT TO LOOK AT. ALSO OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN OF A LOOK AT OTHER SITES AT THE- TO. THE STATE HAS TRIED TO. DISPOSE OF IN A WAY THAT IS GOOD FOR THE TAXPAYERS. THIS PROPERTY IS ONLY BEEN GOING UP. IN COSTS TO THE STATE. IT USED TO BE SIXTY THOUSAND. NOW IT'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEXT YEAR PROBABLY A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND IN TERMS OF LIABILITY TO THE RATEPAYERS IT THEY GRAFFITI IT- THERE WAS A THEY THEY BREAK CAN THE THIRD THEIR WEEDS GROWING UP THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL HAVE TO ORGANIZE- EVENTS TO REMOVE RETWEET TO REMOVE TRASH AND PAINTED OVER. AND IT'S THESE- IT'S IT I GUESS IT'S A COMMUNITY SERVICE PROJECT FOR THE KIDS OF THE SCHOOL BUT- IT'S A IT'S A BLIGHT ON THE SCHOOL AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT IS KIND OF THE- AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY IS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT PROPERTIES ARE OPPOSING A PLAN HAZARD ON COMMUNITIES LIKE. THIS ONE PROBABLY IS AND I'LL CONTINUE TO. YOU KNOW ASK OF MAYBE THE AUTHOR IF HE KNOWS. HOW MUCH OF A- HAZARDOUS IS TO THE COMMUNITY IF ANYTHING AT ALL. THE BILL HAD CENTER ARCHULETA CUTE IN IN RESPONSE TO- CENTER JONES AND REGARDING THE SALE BELOW MARKET. THIS IS ONLY PERMITTED IF DEAN IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE. AND DISCOUNTED SALE PRICE TO DETERMINE TO AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO IT'S NOT A BLANKET IT'S GOT TO BE REANALYZED MAKE SURE CANCER THIS IS WHY I'M I'M HOPING YOU'LL YOU'LL MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT- AND THE SITE IS- AS I MENTIONED IT IS IN MY DISTRICT. AND THE SITE IS VERY NEAR THE TRANSIT THE PROPOSED TRANSIT AREA SHOPPING FREEWAYS EVERYTHING ELSE SO IT'S A GREAT AREA THE CITY OF NORWALK. IS READY TO POUR IN THEIR PORTION OF THE MONEY TO DEVELOP FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TO BRING IN THE COMMERCIAL THAT'S NEEDED AS WELL. SO IT IS THERE AND AS I MENTIONED IT'S BEEN A BAND. FOR GOOD EIGHT YEARS. SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT. US MEMBER CALDERON AND I'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON TO MAKE THIS THING FINALLY HAPPENED. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A FANTASTIC CLOSE COULD HAVE A MOTION ANY OTHER DISCUSSION SPEECH MAY NEED TO CUT OFF- CENTER RUBIO. AM I ON. I WANT TO ALSO PEAK TO IT I KNOW THE AREA VERY WELL AND IT'S I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE CITY OF NORWALK AND DIE WITH HOUSING BEING SUCH A- DEFICIENCY THESE DAYS I THINK IT'SAN APPROPRIATE USE. IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF HOUSING AND I KNOW THAT LIKE I SAID IT'S A NEIGHBORING CITY AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SO I ALSO WITH SUPPORT THAT CAN KILL. THAT THE EMOTIONS THAT ARE RUBIO. IT'S BEEN MADE BY SENATOR RUBIO.

THIS IS ANOTHER BILL IN A LONG LINE OF BILLS THAT HAVE BECOME A HABIT HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE NOT A FISCAL COMMITTEE. BUT I RAISED THE CONCERN. THAT WE'RE NOW GETTING IN THE HABIT OF OBLIGING FUTURE BUDGETS TO FUND SOMETHING. AND WE WILL VOTE FOR IT NOW. PUT IT ON THE BOOKS AND THAT CREATES A PERCEPTION OR AN OBLIGATION THAT IT WILL BE FUNDED IN THE FUTURE. I THINK THAT'S VERY POOR POLICY AND THEREFORE I CANNOT SUPPORT SUCH FIELDS. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN SUPPORTING TINA WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE OUT YOUR DISCLAIMER.

MULTIFACETED MULTI DISCIPLINARY APPROACH AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE AS A SOCIETY FRANKLY BECOME- I'M GONNA BE HONEST A LITTLE BIT LAZY IN THE FAULTING IS JUST HAVING THE POLICE DEAL WITH EVERYTHING I AM WHEN IT COMES TO ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS AND SO MANY OTHER CHALLENGES WE HAVE AS A SOCIETY- IN SO MANY SITUATIONS WE DO NOT NEED A POLICE OFFICER. WITH A GUN TO RESPOND TO THAT SITUATION WE NEED A PROFESSIONAL WHO CAN PROVIDE D. AND HELP SOMEONE- AND DE ESCALATING GET PEOPLE IN THE SERVICES THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO- AS A SOCIETY SO THAT OUR POLICE OFFICERS CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS. ON M. CRIME SCITUATE WHERE YOU NEED A POLICE OFFICER- TO BE INVOLVED AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IT IS SETTING A FOUNDATION- WE WILL YOU KNOW AND OF COURSE WE WILL WORK. IN THE BUDGET GOING FORWARD TO HELP BUT THIS IS ABOUT. SUPPORTING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THEIR EFFORTS- TO TAKE A MUCH MORE THOUGHTFUL.

THEY ASKED TODAY TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF ALL SIX CO CONTACTED THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE NEGOTIATED. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EACH OF THE CHAIRPERSONS OF THE TRIBES WHOSE CONTACT WE'RE JUST COMPACTS WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY THEIR COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATION THROUGH A PANDEMIC AND DEEPALI I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND COLLABORATION IN A DIFFICULT TIME. AFTER MANY MONTHS AND IN SOME CASES MANY YEARS OF NEGOTIATION ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE TABLE AND I TESTIFYING TOGETHER. IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY UNFORTUNATELY THOSE ARE NOT THE TIMES THAT WE LIVE IN. THE GOVERNOR HAS NEGOTIATED AND SIGNED SIX NEW TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACT THESE CONTACTS ARE BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE I. OWN BAND OF MIWOK INDIANS. THE MORE TOWN RANCHERIA OF MY DO INDIANS A SCAN TYPE BANDS OF NO MACHI INDIANS SHINGLE SPRINGS BAND OF MIWOK INDIANS THE TOLOWA DEE NI NATION AND THE TO THE RIVER INDIAN TRIBE OF CALIFORNIA. EACH OF THESE COMPLEXES INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND IS UNIQUE TO EACH TRIBE BUT HE CORE GOALS OF SUPPORTING STRONG SELF SUFFICIENT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. IN FUNDING ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES TRIBAL CITIZENS THE REVENUES GENERATED THROUGH THEIR CASINOS. THE I. OWN COMPACT IS THE FIRST CONTACT FOR THE TRIBE WHICH WILL FACILITATE A NEW REVENUE STREAM TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES THE MORE TOWN DISCONTENT AND HOLLOW COMPACTS WERE NEGOTIATED AHEAD OF THEIR EXPIRING NINETEEN NINETY NINE COMPACT. ALLOWING THEM TO CONTINUE GAINING THE SHINGLE SPRINGS CONTACTUS RENEGOTIATED TO UPDATE THE TERMS FROM ITS TWENTY TWELVE CONTACTS TO ALIGN WITH MORE MODERN COMPACTS THE TO THE RIVER CONTACT WAS RENEGOTIATED TO ADDRESS THE TRIBE'S NEW PARCEL OF GAINING LAND. TO THE RIVERS NEW PARCEL IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS CALLED A TWO PART DETERMINATION OR SECRETARIAL PROCEDURES. THIS IS THE PROCESS SET FORTH IN THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT THAT ALLOWS THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR TO TAKE LAND INTO TRUST. FOR GAMING ACQUIRED AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IF THE TRIBE GOES THROUGH A PROCESS BY WHICH THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR DETERMINES. THE TAKING THIS LAND INTO TRUST WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE TRIBE AND NOT DETRIMENTAL TO THE SOUNDING SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. THE SECRETARY DETERMINED THAT THIS WAS INDEED THE CASE. AND REQUESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR CONCUR WITH HIS DETERMINATION. AFTER EXTENSIVE REVIEW THE GOVERNOR CONCURRED WITH THIS DECISION BECAUSE OF THE POSITIVE IMPACTS FOR THE TRIBE AND ITS MEMBERS AS WELL AS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. ECONOMIC PROVISIONS OF EACH CONTACT SEEK TO ADDRESS THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. SAYS AND MARKET EACH TRIBE ON MAKING SURE TO NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT ANYONE TRY WHEN LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSE COMPAQ'S. COURSE OF THIS APPROACH WAS ENSURING THAT EACH TRIBE IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE FACILITY I DID TENDED BY THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT. AND THAT THE CONTACTS PROVIDED FOR THE FAIR REIMBURSEMENT THE STATE REGULATORY COSTS IS SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND OR STF AS WELL THE REVENUE SHARING WITH LIMITED AND NON GAMING TRIBES THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND AND THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS. THE I. OWN CONTACT WITH A MAXIMUM OF TWELVE HUNDRED DEVICES HE'S PROGRAM STF AND PAYS NO REVENUE SHARING FUNDS. THE MARKET TOWN CONTACT HAS A MAXIMUM OF TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEVICES. AS PRO RATA STF HAS NO SHARING UP TO TWELVE DEVICES. 6% NOW WHEN WITH 80% CREDITS BETWEEN TWELVE. HUNDRED ONE AND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DEVICES AND 6% NOT WINDY 65% CREDITS FROM EIGHT HUNDRED.

AND 6% THAT WENT WITH 60% CREDITS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ONE DEVICES AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DEVICES. THE CREDITS AGAINST REVENUE SHARING PAYMENTS. THERE WERE PRIOR MENTION OUR AGREED UPON AS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL USES OF FUNDING. ROOTING FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING HEALTHCARE AND OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THIS RUNNING COMMUNITY AND THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS COMPACT INCLUDING TERMS RELATING TO LICENSING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT LABOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THAT THE CABAZON COMPACTS THAT WAS RATIFIED BY THIS BODY LAST YEAR. THE SUBSTANTIAL SIMILARITY INCLUDES PROTECTIONS AGAINST WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT PROVISIONS TO ADOPT AND COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT INCLUSION OF THE STATE'S MINIMUM WAGE RATES. RIDES WILL ADOPT THE STANDARD TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE CONTACTS ALSO INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IN MITIGATION BUT LESS INTENSIVE PROP PROCESS EASE IF THE TRIBE OPERATES UNDER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DEVICES. ACTIVE OF THE DEVICE COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS REQUIRE THAT A HEAD OF ANY PROJECT THE TRIBE MUST ANALYZE AND DOCUMENT OFFERS A REACHING IMPACTS. PROVIDE FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND COME TO A MITIGATION AGREEMENT WITH THE LOCAL OR STATE GOVERNMENTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I AM HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTIONS. AB MISTAKE I DO I CAN YOU GO A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON HOW THESE CREDITS WORK IN WHAT THE THINKING IS BEHIND THOSE. IS THE IDEA TO TRY TO KEEP MOST THE REVENUE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE JUST WHAT WHAT IS THE APPROACHED. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THAT QUESTION GERMAN DOT. SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS ONE OF OUR GREATEST PRIORITIES HERE IS REVENUE SHARING WITH LIMITED AND NON GAMING TRIBES AND SO. WE ARE SOMEWHAT PROTECTIVE OF THAT BUT IN RECOGNIZING THAT TRIBES CONTRIBUTE SO MUCH AND SHE ABOVE AND BEYOND. SORT OF REGULAR GOVERNMENT SERVICES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES- AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND- FOR EXAMPLE ALL DAY I JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD A SHINGLE SPRINGS I KNOW. HAS WHITE WATER RESCUE TEAM THE ONLY ONE IN THE AREA. AND YOU KNOW. DISCONTENT INVESTS IN THE LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW TULE RIVER HAS ITS OWN SCHOOL AS ITS OWN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND IS REVIVING LANGUAGES- I MEAN ALL OF THE TRIBES ARE YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN SORT OF OPERATING THESE AMAZING PROGRAMS. AND SO THE IDEA IS TO GIVE CREDIT OFF OF THOSE REVENUE SHARING PAYMENTS. FOR THE SORT OF MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL INVESTMENTS AND- THEN THE GOAL OF THIS IS NOT ONLY TO KIND OF RECOGNIZE WHETHER THE AMAZING THINGS THAT ALL OF THE TRIBES ARE DOING. BUT ALSO TO KIND OF INCENTIVIZE THAT CONTINUED LOCAL INVESTMENT AND SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE PROCESS THAT HAPPENS IS. THE TRIBE KIND OF SUBMITS TO THE STATE YOU KNOW HERE'S WHAT WE ARE PLANNING ON DOING UNDER THE TERMS OF THE COMPACT WE REVIEW IT WE DISCUSS IT SOMETIMES WE NEED MORE INFORMATION USUALLY IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. AND THEN WE SAY GREAT THE- GOES AHEAD AND- YOU KNOW SPENDS THAT THOSE FUNDS AND THEN AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THERE'S SORT OF A AN ACCOUNTING PROCESS WHERE THEY SAY HERE'S WHAT WE SPEND ALL OF THE FUNDS ON YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THAT OBVIOUSLY CHANGES OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR- AND THEN WE HAVE SORT OF A RECONCILIATION PROCESS AND THEN BACK TO MOUNT. THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY TO THE STATE'S OF THE FUNDS NEVER COME TO THE STATE AT ALL IT STAYS WITH THE TRIBE IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. WE THINK THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY KIND OF BENEFICIAL. ASPECT TO THESE COMPACT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS THE MARK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I'VE SEEN NONE- NOW WE WILL MOVE TO SERRA DISCHI- TRIBAL CHAIR FOR THE I. OWN BAD I BELIEVE SHE'S HERE IN THE GALLERY CHAIRWOMAN WELCOME. THANK YOU. I COULD MORNING CHAIRMAN DODD TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SCARED THAT FUTURE WON'T FOR THE I AM THE ENEMY WALK INDIANS. I'LL BE HALF OF THE TRIBE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND I'LL DO MY BEST TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF. I THE I AM IN A ME WALK INDIANS IS LOCATED IN AMADOR COUNTY NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE. AND IT'S AN AREA THAT WE HAVE CALLED HOME FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. WITHIN ENROLLED MEMBERSHIP OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY INDIVIDUALS. WE ARE BY FAR THE LARGEST TRIBE IN OUR REGION. AND ANNA MENTIONED WE ARE PRESENTLY THE ONLY TRIBE WITH THE COMPACT BEFORE YOU TODAY. THAT IS NOT INVOLVED IN GAMING. LIKE SO MANY OF OUR SISTER TRIBAL NATIONS IN CALIFORNIA OUR HISTORY IS PRETTY TRAGIC. INVOLVING A CENTURY LONG EFFORT TO RESTORE A GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES. AND TO SECURE OUR HOMELAND CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR POPULATION. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF TRIBAL LEADERS AND CITIZENS. WE'RE ABLE TO RESTORE THAT GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. AND JUST ON MARCH TWENTIETH OF THIS YEAR WE RESTORED OUR VERY FIRST LANCER TRUST IN AMADOR COUNTY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ACRES RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE CITY OF PLYMOUTH. OF COURSE OUR EFFORTS FOR TO REGAIN OUR RECOGNITION AND TO RESTORE LOCAL HOMELAND HAVE NOT COME WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT COST. HIGH PROPERTY VALUES IN OUR AREA COMBINED WITH COST TO UNDERGO THE FEDERAL FEE TO TRUST PROCESS. AS WELL AS THE YEARS OF LITIGATION DEFENDING ARE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED STATUS. AND OUR RIGHT TO RESTORE LAND BASED. HAVE LEFT US WITH CONSIDERABLE DEBT. FURTHER THE LACK OF A LAND BASED AND FIND IN HAVE SUFFICIENTLY CONSTRAINED OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP CRITICAL PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CITIZENS. TRIBAL GAMING QUITE FRANKLY. IS OUR ONLY MEANS OF MEETING THESE OBLIGATIONS AND TO BEGINNING TO BUILD A ROBUST IN SUPPORT OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENT FOR OUR PEOPLE. TODAY I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT OUR RECENTLY NEGOTIATED AND AGAIN VERY FIRST TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACT. SO WE ARE THE ONLY TRIED THAT IT IS NOT PRESENTLY ENGAGED IN GAMING WE ARE NOT STRANGERS TO THE POSITIVE IMPACTS TRIBAL GAMING HAS ON THE COMMUNITY IT VASTLY CHANGES THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE NOT ONLY ON BUT AROUND TRIBAL LANDS. IT CREATES JOBS GENERATES SECONDARY REVENUE THAT BENEFITS INDIAN COUNTRY AND OUR NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. REVENUE FROM GAMING OPERATIONS ALLOWS TRIED TO TRIED TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT CITIZENS. SECURE ESSENTIAL SERVICES PROTECT CULTURAL RESOURCES PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AND ASSIST OUR NON TRIBAL NEIGHBORS TO GRANT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. THESE ARE PRECISELY THE SAME GOALS WE HAVE WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE. AS A RESULT OF OUR OWN GAMING OPERATIONS. JUST NOTE IN A COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT ANNA NOTED FR YOU ABOUT OUR CONTACT. IT AUTHORIZES UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED CLASS THREE GAMING MACHINES AS WELL AS OTHER FORMS OF GAMING. IT THAT'S FOR THE MEDIAN FOR CONSUMER AND EMPLOYEE PROTECTIONS. CONTAINS VIGOROUS PROVISIONS FOR THE MITIGATION OF OFF RESERVATION IMPACTS OF THE GAMING FACILITY. IT DEMONSTRATES THIS TRIBE STRONG COMMITMENT TO REVENUE SHARING THROUGH THE R. S. T. F. AND THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDED FUTURE YEARS. FUNDS IN FACT PROVIDED MY TRIBE WITH VALUABLE RESOURCES- FOR MANY YEARS. IT REFLECTS THE TRIBES PLEDGE TO COMMUTE TO SUPPORT INVOLVEMENT IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. FOR IMPROVED EMERGENCY SERVICES LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ALL DESIGNED TO BENEFIT NOT ONLY TO TRY BUT AMADOR COUNTY AS A WHOLE. AND OF COURSE. THE COMP PROVIDE THE TRIBE WITH THE MEANS OF GENERATING REVENUE THAT WE CAN USE TO ESTABLISH LONG TERM ECONOMIC SELF SUFFICIENCY. AND PROSPERITY FOR OUR TRIBAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR CITIZENS. GIVEN OPERATIONS WILL GENERATE REVENUE TO SUPPORT OUR SOCIAL EACH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS HOUSING HEALTHCARE PRESERVATION% OF CULTURE RESOURCES ALL THINGS THAT WE STILL STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN. IT'S A REALLY REALLY EXCITING TIME FOR US. I LIKE TO THINK GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE AND IN PARTICULAR AND IN A MARK FOR HER PROFESSIONALISM. AND INTEGRITY AS WE WORK TO COME TO AGREEMENT ON THE CONTACT AS WELL AS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHO WORKED HARD IN HELPING TO BRING OUR CONTACT HOME. AND ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE ONCE AGAIN FOR YOUR ATTENTION TODAY AND URGE YOU TO SUPPORT OUR CONTACT.

I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ANNONAY MARC IN THE GOVERNOR AND ALL OF THEIR STAFF WHO WORKED TIRELESSLY WITH THE TRIBE IN OUR STAFF TO GET THIS ACCOMPLISHED THE BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A BRIEF BACKGROUND OF THE TRIBE AND ITS MEMBERSHIP GOVERNMENT AND GAMING OPERATIONS THE TRIBE IS OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE WITH ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MEMBERS AND SITUATED ON THE TULE RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION TULARE COUNTY RESERVATION CONSIST OF LOCATED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILES FROM THE CITY AFFORDABLE TULARE COUNTY THE TROUBLE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES TO ITS MEMBERSHIP WHICH INCLUDES EDUCATION HEALTH HOUSING LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE TRIBAL COURT SERVICES AMBULANCE SERVICE PUBLIC UTILITIES NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE SERVICE WE ALSO. PROVIDE AN ELDER CENTER AND OF. CENTER TO THE FOR THOSE MEMBERS THE TRIBE HAS WORKED. TERRACE THE TO THE- OF LIFE FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS HAVE SUFFERED FROM A HISTORY OF FORCED REMOVAL. AND DISPOSITION TRIBAL LANDS AND RESOURCES ALTHOUGH ON RESERVATIONS SOCIAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED OVER TIME. RESIDENTS CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR APPROXIMATELY 40% ON RESERVATION. AND APPROXIMATELY HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE NEAR OR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. ADDITIONALLY MANY MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY DUE TO SEVERE SHORTAGES ON THE RESERVATION. AS A RESULT OF WATER SHORTAGES THE TRIBE HAD TO PLACE A MORATORIUM ON BUILDING NEW STRUCTURES ON THE RESERVATION. INCLUDING TRIBAL HOUSING EVEN THOUGH THE TRIBE HAS A HOUSING WAITING LIST OF OVER TWO HUNDRED FAMILIES AT THIS TIME. THE TRIBES EXISTING CASINOS LOCATED ON THE RESERVATION BUT DUE TO GROWING TRIBAL POPULATION INCREASED DEMAND FOR SUPPORT SERVICES INFLATION OF SUPPORT COSTS. AS YOU KNOW REVENUES ARE NO LONGER SUFFICIENT. SEVERAL FACTORS ALSO LIMIT THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF THE EXISTING CASINO SUCH AS THE- CATION. THROAT ONLY ACCESS TO THE- AND THE LIMITED DEVELOP AREA TO WATER SHE- ON THE REST OF. AND THE- ITSELF. SB AC NINE WOULD. THE COMPACT WHICH AMENDS THE TRIBES TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN COMPACT IN ORDER TO FACILITATE. THE RELOCATION OF THE EXISTING CASINO. TO A TRAVELING OWN FORTY ACRE PARCEL OF LAND. LOCATED WITH THE TRIBES ABORIGINAL TERRITORY IN THE CITY F PORTER. REGARDING THE RELOCATION SITE SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ISSUED A POSITIVE TERMINATION IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. REGARDING GAMING ELIGIBILITY AT THE RELOCATION SITE. THE TRIBES APPLICATION TO PLACE THE RELOCATION SITE IN THE TRUST. AND THE GOVERNOR CONCURRED WITH THE SECRETARY'S DETERMINATION ON AUGUST THIRD OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY. THE TRIBE HAS A LONG HISTORY AT THE RELOCATION SITE IS FIVE MILES NORTH OF THE TRIBES AND RATIFIED. EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE TREATY TERRITORY AND FIVE MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE TRIBE'S ORIGINAL RESERVATION. BOTH THE CITY AND THE STATE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE TRYING TO SPEAK THE MOST CLOSELY CONNECTED. WITH HUMAN REMAINS AND FUNERARY OBJECTS DISCOVERED. NEAR THE RELOCATION SITE. LIVING THE EXISTING TO THE- SITE IS. TO INCREASE YOUR RESERVATIONS FIVE BY ADDITIONALLY THE RELOCATION OF EXISTING CASINO IS EXPECTED TO NEARLY DOUBLE THE TRIBE'S CAPTURING THE LOCAL GAMING MARKET. REVENUE OF THE OPERATION OF THE CASINO WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING HEALTH EDUCATIONAL SOCIAL CULTURAL AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. FOR THE TRIBAL MEMBERS AND PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS. THE CASINO'S RELOCATION ALSO ASSIST THE COUNTY'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WHICH AS OF MAY TWENTY TWENTY WAS EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT. THE SIX HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE. RELOCATION OF THE CASINOS ESTIMATED TO CREATE TWELVE HUNDRED TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION JOBS. AND A NET INCREASE OF SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY PERMANENT JOBS AND THE REGIONAL GAMING MARKET CAN'T SUPPORT THE CASINO'S RELOCATION. ALONG WITH EXISTING IN. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELOCATION OF THE CASINO THE TRIBE AND THE CITY WILL CONSTRUCT A WATER RECLAMATION FACILITY ON CITY OWNED PROPERTY. RECYCLED WATER FROM THE RECLAMATION FACILITY WILL REPLACE THE POSSIBLE WATER CURRENTLY USED AT THE CITY SPORTS COMPLEX. BECAUSE THE PROJECT WILL USE LESS BOTTLE WATER. THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY USED TO IRRIGATE THE SPORTS COMPLEX THERE WILL BE A DAY INCREASE IN AVAILABLE POTABLE WATER FOR THE SEAT. THE TRIBE HAS THE SUPPORT THE COUNTY AND THE CITY FOR THE RELOCATION.
