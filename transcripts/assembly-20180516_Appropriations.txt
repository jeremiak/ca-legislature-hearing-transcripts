VERY GOOD. MR BELOW. YEAH. JUST LIKE MISTER OBERNOLTE SAID. YOU JUST HEARD SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH A NUMBER OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING RAISED BY THEM. MANUFACTURES. IT'S OUR LEVEL OF. UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD A NETWORK WITH THEM AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO TRY TO REFINE MAY NOT GET A FULL BRIDGE. BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU BUT. TO GIVE SOME. CONSIDERATION. HERE AND MAYBE GET SOME AGREEMENT ON A FEW. ISSUES THAT CAN BE TIGHTENED UP. ABSOLUTELY I THINK WE'VE MADE THAT COMMITMENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. ONE THIS WAS PRESENTED AND JUDICIARY. WE CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THE OPPOSITION AND AS LATE AS LAST NIGHT. WE DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT WE WILL BE MEETING AGAIN TO CONTINUE THE DISK. SO MANY OF REFER THE QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION DO WE HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF COMMITMENT FROM YOU. TO OBTAIN SOME OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE. PERHAPS AND FIND COMPROMISE GROUND FROM MY SINGLE. WORK. THE MOST ASK HONEST ANSWERS PERHAPS NOT. I'M WE HAVE REPEATEDLY ASKED THE DEALERS TO IDENTIFY THE TWO OR THREE ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THEM. NOT THE TWENTY FIVE ISSUES THAT ARE NOW IN THE BILL BUDGET TWENTY FIVE THAT WERE REGIONALLY AND. WE ARE NOT IN THE POSITION TO REWARD CONDUCT WHERE YOU PUT SOMETHING STUPID AND UPHILL THROW IT OUT ANDASK YOU TO BE COMMENDED WE CAN'T DO THAT. IF THEY IDENTIFIED THE TWO OR THREE IMPORTANT ISSUES. THAT WE HAVE NEGOTIATED IN THE PAST WHICH BILL RE OPENS. WE ARE PREPARED TO DO THAT BUT NOT THE SWEET BEING ECONOMY WHY CHANGES THAT THEY ARE PROPOSING IN THIS. I APPRECIATE THE BRAVADO THAT YOU HAVE IN THE. AND THE FEELINGS THAT YOU HAVE. I WOULD PREFER TO HEAR MORE YES I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH BUT. UNFORTUNATELY I SEE THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY AT A POINT OF THE IMPASSE. AND IT IS A PLACE WHERE LIKE MR A MOMENT HE JUST SAT WHERE THE LEGISLATURE MUST WAIT. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AYE AND. WILL WORK BEST ON ANOTHER ONE. AND. MISTER BIG. IS THERE NOW. MISTER BONTA. BUT I AM. THANK YOU TO THE OTHER FOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORTY HAVING THIS DISCUSSION I'M I'M SORT OF TRY TO CATCH UP ON THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE BILL I JUST HAD. A COUPLE QUICK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. M.. IS THERE A COMPONENT OF THE BILL THE OUTLAWS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES FOR CARS AND AND AND AND IF SO P. Q. TALK LIVE ABOUT THE THINKING BEHIND THAT AND IF THERE'S A OUTLAW THEM BUT I'M GOING TO ALLOW. IT IT WITH CHAIRS PERMISSION TO HAVE MISTER COSTER RESPOND TO THAT I KNOW THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE. COMPLAINTS THAT. CLAIM THAT ANY CLARIFICATION WE HELP THE S.. GREAT QUESTION MR BONTA OUT OF THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS ARE IN SUBDIVISION ó OF THE BILL AND I. PUT A BUILDING WHICH P. LIKE SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE LANGUAGE SAYS IS THAT IF YOU'RE A MANUFACTURER AND A FRANCHISE OR. VIN YOU CANNOT SELL SERVICE. SO LEASE OR SUBSCRIBE VEHICLES WITHOUT. UNLESS YOU USE EXCLUSIVELY YOUR FRANCHISE DE. SO. MANY OF THE MANUFACTURERS ARGUE THAT WE BAND SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMS OUR RESPONSES IS NO WE'RE NOT WE'RE SAYING THAT ALL MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR LOCAL FRANCHISE. HE'S IN THE PROCESS OF DOING SUBSCRIPTIONS YOU HAVE FRANCHISEES IN EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY WE HAVE A FLEET OF CARS THAT WE PURCHASED FROM YOU. USE US THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR PLEASE DON'T COMPETE AGAINST US THAT'S WHAT THE THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL SETS UP INDIANA FOR EXAMPLE ACTUALLY PUT A ONE YEAR MORATORIUM SAYING. CAR SUBSCRIPTIONS CAN NOT OCCUR IN THE STATE OF INDIANA THAT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT OUR LANGUAGE SAYS HERE WHAT WE'RE SAYING THIS IS JUST USUAL LOCAL DEALERS. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMS SOME MANUFACTURERS LIKE MERCEDES BMW AND NOW CADILLAC ARE ROLLING OUT THESE PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE USING DEALERS BUT NOT ALL ARE AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT COMPETE. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION UP ANOTHER AREA WHERE WAS I COULD USE A LITTLE CLARIFICATION IS ABOUT THAT THE RELEVANT MARKET AREA AND THE DEFINITION IN IN THE BILL. KEY TALK ABOUT WHAT CHANGES ARE MADE AND AND WHY YOU THINK THEY'RE NECESSARY. THE PLACE. ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION SO RELEVANT MARKET AREA RIGHT NOW WITH THE LOW STATUTE SAYS IS THAT. A MANUFACTURER IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO COMPETE AGAINST A DEALER OF THE SAME LINE MAKE IN THE RELEVANT MARKET AREA RELEVANT MARKET AREAS DEFINED AS A TEN MILE RADIUS AROUND. THE DEALERSHIP THAT IS SET OUT IN STATUTE. WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEN IS THAT ONE MANUFACTURER STARTED SELLING PARTS DIRECTLY ON AMAZON NOW OUR PROBLEM ISN'T THE FACT THAT IT'S BEING SOLD ON THE INTERNET? WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT WE CARE IS THAT A MANUFACTURER'S NOW COMPETING AGAINST A DEALER BY SELLING PARTS. IN THEIR RELEVANT MARKET AREA SO WE DISSOCIATION WROTE A LETTER. TO GENERAL MOTORS EXCUSE ME THAT MANUFACTURER AND PASSED THE MANUFACTURER TO SPECIFICALLY RESPOND TO OUR GATE ARE ALLEGATIONS. WE GOT THREE RISEN SENSUALLY THREE RESPONSES IN THE LETTER FIRST WAS IS. WE'RE NOT SELLING PARTS ONLINE. TWO IF WE WERE SELLING PARTS ONLINE IS A STATUTE ISN'T CLEAR ABOUT THAT WE CAN'T COMPETE AGAINST YOU WANT PARKS AND THREE. IF WE WERE SELLING ONLINE AND THE STATUTE SAYS THERE WHERE ARE PROHIBITED FROM SELLING PARTS. WE'RE SELLING IT WITHIN THE STATE NOT IRRELEVANT MARKET AREA AND SO THE RESPONSE MY DEALER SAID IS IS WAIT A MINUTE IF NOW YOU CAN SELL THINGS ONLINE AND IT'S NOT GOING IN MY RELEVANT MARKET AREA AND IT'S GOING TO THE STATE. THAT'S NOT FAIR THAT UNDERMINES THE IT'S A BASIC UNDERSTANDING WE HAD ABOUT COMPETITION THAT ALSO UNDERMINES CALIFORNIA STATUTE AND SO WE DECIDED AND PASSED. THE AUTHOR IF WE COULD CHANGE THAT FROM RELEVANT MARKET AREA TO SKATE THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE DO IS TO TRY TO CAPTURE THE ENEMY. THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING. MAY I RESPOND. THINK YOU KNOW MARRIAGE OUT NOW I'M SORRY BUT THAT'S NOT THE WHERE IN THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANKS MONEY TO. THE FINAL COMMENT YEAH NO MORE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION I APPRECIATE IT I AM. WITH MY FINAL COMMENT WILL BE STRIKES ME THAT SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE BEING ASKED WE PUT THE STATUTE MAY BE ABLE TO BE. NEGOTIATED AND AND AND PUT TO A CONTRACT THAT YOU HAVE WITH THE MANUFACTURERS. AND SO. I THINK SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN SHARINGSOME OF THE SAME I THINK IS A DESIRE THAT. SOME GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS OCCUR TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES. I THINK IF WE HAVE TO WILL ADDRESS THEM BUT I THINK WE PREFER THAT THAT THE GOOD FAITH. SO NEGOTIATED PROCESS ADDRESS SOME NUMBER OF THEM BEFORE FOR THE LEGISLATURE WAY AND I THINK IF YOU CONSIDERATION OF THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEEN OTHER COMMENTS ALL JUST MEET MIND I'M. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE. OPPONENTS REACTION TO THE QUESTION BY MY COLLEAGUE UP AND. IT I FOUND IT INTERESTING WITH MY COLLEAGUE MISTER BIGELOW. USERNAME RIGHT. I'M. WHAT MR BONTA SAYS IS RIGHT BUT YOU JUST TOLD US HE WON'T NEGOTIATE? I FIND THE DISPLAY BECAUSE YESTERDAY YOU ARE MY OFFICE ASKING FOR NEXT WEEK FOR NEGOTIATIONS I TALK TO THE AUTHOR SHE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THAT YOU YOU GUYS WEREN'T OPEN NEGOTIATIONS THAT CLEARLY IS TRUE. FROM WHAT I JUST HEARD IT I WOULD SUGGEST SIR. IN IN ITS VERY AYE AYE YOU. LITERALLY HAVE NEVER HAD SOMEONE SET. THEY'RE LOSING SAYING WE WON'T NEGOTIATE SO I THINK YOU ARE. HAVING DONE NEGOTIATIONS FOR A LONG TIME IN MY PASSED OUT SO YOU'RE IN A BAD SPOT. AND THAT'S PROBABLY NOT AN ATTITUDE. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY. I NOT BE ROLLED OVER WITH THIS BILL SO I I WOULD JUST SUGGEST YOU YOU RETHINK THAT ATTITUDE AND PERHAPS GIVE. THE AUTHOR THE KIND OF RESPECT SHE DESERVES AND ASKING TO COME TOGETHER OR OR ELSE YOUR COMPLAINTS ARE MEANINGLESS YOU CAN'T SIT IN TULSA BUDDY YOU YOU. NOW MOTHER YOU HAVE TO TWO POINTS YOU'RE ALLOWED TO MAKE IN THIS BILL AND YOU HAVE TWENTY FIVE THAT YOU'RE MAKING. BECAUSE YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE SAYING THAT TO THE SUPPORTERS BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT TO THE AUTHOR THAT'S HIGHLY DISRESPECT. SO.

DEAN NO AUTHORS OF MISTER GALLAGHER YOU WANTED TO PRESENT ON A SUSPENSE BILL. YOU'LL BE PRISON ON AB THIRTY FORTY FIVE. AND WE ARE JUST SO IT IS CLEAR WE'RE WAITING ON MR KANSEN CHU. MISS RUBIO WHO I KNOW WAS HERE BEFORE. THAT'S IT. IT PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THEN AS YOU KNOW I WOULD NOT NORMALLY PRESENT A SUSPENSE CANDIDATE VATOS PRETTY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT I JUST WANTED TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE COMMITTEE. I AB THIRTY FORTY FIVE. IS THE ONLY SUSPENSE CANADA THAT I WILL PRESENT IN ON THIS YEAR AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES BRIEF ATTENTION. AT THIS BILL WOULD CREATE AN INDEPENDENT BODY. TO OVERSEE THE STATE WATER PROJECT AS PROPOSED BY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. AS A TO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FAILURE OF THE OROVILLE SPILLWAY SHOWED CALIFORNIA MUST DO BETTER. IN MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT THE FORENSIC TEAM THAT INVESTIGATED THAT DISASTER FOUND THAT ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES CONTRIBUTED TO THAT FAILURE. THE FACTORS INCLUDED OVER OVER CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT A REACTIVE VERSUS PROACTIVE APPROACH TO PROJECT MANAGEMENT. AND COST CONTROL PRESSURES. AT IS QUICKLY LIKE TO PLAN A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE. KEY FINDINGS THAT WE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO. ONE THERE WAS A THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR DESIGN FLAW IN THIS BILL AND AS IT WAS CONSTRUCTED THAT EVERY EXPERT THAT'S LOOKED AT THIS. HAS SAID THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE AND IS THAT WHAT IT IS IS EMBEDDING THE DRAINS IN THIS BILL WAY CONSIDERING THE GEOLOGIC CONDITIONS UP THERE. AND WHAT SHOULD BUT NOT AT THE TIME THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTICED AS A DESIGN FLAW. EW ARE NEVER LOOKED BACK AT THE AS BILLS OR THE DESIGNS OF THE PROJECT. AND SO THIS CONTINUE TO BE GO. UNNOTICED AND UNRECOGNIZED. AT THE DEPARTMENT. CRACKING THAT CONTINUALLY HAPPENED EVERY TEN YEARS ON THE SPILLWAY. SHOULD HAVE RAISE RED FLAGS THIS WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. AB WAS IT INSTEAD NORMALIZED. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND THE OVER CONFIDENCE FACTOR NINE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN. SIM AND PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS RECOGNIZE. AT HERB BROUGHT TO. DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ATTENTION THAT THERE WERE GEOLOGIC ISSUES WITH WHETHER OF ROCK ON THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. DE W. R. RESPONDED AND SAID NO THIS IS BUILT ON COMPETENT ROCK. AND ACTUALLY RESPONDED WITH AN ATTACHMENT TO ONE OF THEIR MEMOS. SHOWING SOME OF THE GEOLOGIC LE. BOREN'S IF THEY WERE TO LOOK CLOSER AT THOSE ACTUAL BORING'S THAT THEY SHOWED THAT THEY ACTUALLY GAVE A. TO FOR THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT THERE WAS GEOLOGIC. WEATHERED ROCK IN THOSE FORMATIONS. SO THERE'S SOME VERY SERIOUS ISSUES HERE AND IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE ENTIRE PROJECT BEING. OPERATED REGULATORY DECISIONS ARE ULTIMATELY. THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT. IT'S ALSO REGULATED AND INSPECTED BY THEIR DIVISION OF THEM SAFETY. AND THIS IS BY ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES I'VE SEEN WHERE WE THE OWNER AND OPERATOR ALSO REGULATES. THE SAME PROJECT REGULATORY DECISIONS ARE ALSO WE MADE BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT WHO ALSO ACTS AS A WATER MANAGER. IS INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT THE OWNER OF THE PROJECT. IS ALSO THE REGULAR MOVED MOVING FORWARD. MY MOVING THE PROJECT TO AN INDEPENDENT BODY NOT ONLY REMOVES THIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST BUT IT ALSO INCREASES TRANSPARENCY. ABOUT PROJECT OPERATIONS AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT. IN THE. IN THE INDEPENDENT FORENSIC REPORT IT STATED THAT WHAT THERE WAS COST PRESSURES APPLY TO YOU W. OR BY THE WATER CONTRACTORS THEY WERE NOT SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT HAPPENED. THEY SAID THESE ISSUES MAY HAVE BEEN RAISED IN MEETINGS HERE'S THE PROBLEM A LOT OF THOSE MEANS ARE NOT PUBLIC. THIS INDEPENDENT COMMISSION WOULD BE SUBJECT TO BAGLEY KEENE AND THEREFORE THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE WOULD BE MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT. TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. CALIFORNIA'S IN OUT LIAR IN ITS MANAGEMENT THE STATE WATER PROJECT OTHER LARGE SCALE STATE PROJECTS ARE RUN BY INDEPENDENT AND. DECISIONS ABOUT THESE PROJECTS ARE MADE IN PUBLIC MEETINGS BY INDEPENDENT BODIES THAT REPRESENT STATEWIDE INTERESTS. MY ALSO MATCHES HERE'S THIS IS BETTER OPERATIONS NOT JUST FOR ORVILLE BUT FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS STATE WHO RELIES ON THAT WATER IF YOU ARE A WATER CONTRACTOR IF YOU LIVE IN A.
