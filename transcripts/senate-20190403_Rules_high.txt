I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR FAMILY AND THANK THEM FOR SHARING YOU WITH US I KNOW THERE'S PRIME IN MANY FIRE SEASONS WHERE. YOU'VE BEEN A RARE OCCURRENCE ON THE HOME FRONT -- THAT THAT DOES LEADING TO ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WITH OUR ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATIONS AND WE'VE HAD SOME. OPPORTUNITIES I THINK WE FIRST MET AT THE SOBRE HONEST FIRE IN MY DISTRICT [inaudible] WHICH WAS. LARGE AND DEVASTATING FORTUNATELY MOSTLY. TO THE FOREST IN NOT TO TO HUMANS ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME. NOTABLE CASUALTIES. FROM THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED A THIRTY FIVE FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS AS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION REPORT. WHEN IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT TIME LINE ON THAT WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS REPORT AND HOW WERE THOSE? COMMUNITIES IDENTIFIED. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING THE THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS THAT ARE. CALLED OUT -- IN THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT ALL CALL IT -- ARE ARE ALL EQUAL PRIORITY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S THAT'S CLEAR EVERYONE OF THOSE PROJECTS WE WILL WE WILL BE TAKING AS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT IT'S IN -- THE TIME FRAME -- FOR ACTING ON THOSE -- IS START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE -- SOME OF THEM THAT HAD SOME OF THE SEQUEL WORK -- AHEAD DONE AHEAD OF TIME -- ARE READY TO START TODAY -- THE REST OF THEM ARE IN A RIDLEY -- VERY SHORT REVIEW PROCESS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH -- THE SECRETARIES -- OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND EPA ON AN EXPEDITED -- REVIEW OF AND THAT THAT INCLUDES THE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON THAT WILL BE -- EMPLOYED ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS. GREAT WELL THANK YOU AND THEN -- ALSO JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP YOU SHARED SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION YESTERDAY. RESPONDER FATIGUE THE CONCERNS OF LONGER FIRE SEASON LONGER TIME OF SEPARATION FIREFIGHTERS AND FAMILIES. IN JUST THE PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL. FATIGUE AND SOMETIMES TRAUMA ON THE FRONT LINES OF FIRE. HELL IS CAL FIRE APPROACHING THAT MAYBE YOU COULD SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE WHAT SOME O THE EXPECTED A DAYS OF SERVICE ARE WHEN YOU'RE. IN ACTIVE FIRE FIRE FIGHTING MODE BECAUSE I FOUND IT KIND OF AMAZING THE CONTINUOUS DAYS OF WORK. YES -- WE WE ASK A LOT OF OF OUR STATE FIREFIGHTERS -- AN EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACROSS THE BOARD -- SOME OF THOSE ARE FIREFIGHTERS THEY'RE THEY'RE ALSO SUPPORT THROUGH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT RESPOND -- BUT I'LL SPEAK ON BEHALF OF CAL FIRE WE WE WE TRULY HAVE PASSED -- OUR EMPLOYEES TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WE WE ARE SEEING A LONGER FIRE SEASON. IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DAYS LONGER -- EVERY YEAR THAN IT HAS BEEN -- THAN IT WAS. TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS AGO AND AND AND PREVIOUS TO THAT -- SO PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING THAT WINTER BREAK TO START AS EARLY OR THEIR SPRINGS THERE'S OUR ARCH CUT SHORT -- AND SO WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS -- THAT THE TRADITIONAL -- JUST GO GO GO -- IS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN AND THE WHAT WE BEN -- AND IT'S IT'S NOT A ABSOLUTE FOR MORE -- FOURTEEN DAYS AND TWENTY ONE DAYS BUT THOSE ARE THE TWO BREAKING POINTS THAT WE USE -- WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL A IS OUT FOR FOURTEEN DAYS THEY NEED TO HAVE A RESET FOR A DAY? IF IT'S IF THEY'RE GONNA BE OUT FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS IT'S A TWO DAY RESET. AND AS IT STANDS -- IN IN OUR INFORMAL POLICY NOW -- WE WE WE DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM TO RETURN THEM HOME AT THAT POINT -- IS THAT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT AND THAT IS DOING THAT ONE OR TWO DAY BREAK THAT IS TRUE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT IS CONCERNING TO ME THAT WE HAVE -- FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS THAT ARE OUT FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS MAY HAVE TWO DAYS OF OF RECOVERY IN A HOTEL AND GO BACK TO WORK FOR ANOTHER -- TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THAT CAN HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND AND FIREFIGHTERS **** AT TIMES HAVE BEEN OUT FOR A SIXTY PLUS DAYS. WITHOUT EVER GETTING HOME TO SEE THEIR FAMILIES THAT SUBJECT TO REVIEW CURRENTLY IS ARE THEIR BREAKING POINT SWEAR. ADDING AN EXTRA DAY TO RESET WERE. AFTER FORTY DAYS SIR FIFTY DAYS YOU GET A WEEK OR SOMETHING -- THAT WOULD HELP. IT'S THE A WHO WE NEED TO REVIEW THE ENTIRE OUR OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM AND PART OF THE PART OF THE DIFFICULTY WE'VE HAD IN. IN MAKING ADJUSTMENTS ON THE FLY AND I'LL SAY THAT IS WHILE THESE THESE -- SEASONS HAVE BEEN WEARING ON IS THAT WE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FIREFIGHTERS. IN ORDER TO BACK FILL THE COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING TO EVERY FIRE. AND SO -- WE'RE SHORT THE BODIES TO DO ACTUALLY WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE DOING -- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH -- THIS BUDGET AND IN EVERY -- BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORWARD WE ARE STAFFING APPROPRIATELY -- THE THE ENGINES AND THE THE DIFFERENT APPARATUS. THAT NEED TO BE COVERED WITH THE PROPER NUMBER OF OF POSITIONS PER SEAT -- AND TRYING TO WORK WHERE WE CAN TO BOLSTER -- THE AREAS WHERE WERE SHORT THANK YOU AND THEN ALONG THESE LINES MY FINAL QUESTION MADAM CHAIR BUT YOU ALSO SHARED SOME OF THE INNOVATION AND COMMITMENT ONSITE COUNSELING SERVICES AND COULD YOU JUST SHARE THE PROGRESS OF OF SOME OF THAT. IN THE INNOVATION THAT'S UNDER WAY THANK YOU SENATOR MONITOR EIGHT MONTHS MONEY FOR BRINGING THAT BACK -- THAT THAT IS OUR EMPLOYEES SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM AND IT IS -- PART OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET THAT IS MOVING FORWARD -- IT IS A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE. SEVERAL EMPLOYEES THAT ARE ALREADY A PART OF ABOUT SEVEN STATEWIDE THIS WOULD INCREASE THAT -- BY WITH ANOTHER -- FOURTEEN AND IT IS A PROGRAM THAT -- THAT ALLOWS US TO GO. TO THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT. DAD I AM BE WHERE THEY THEY ARE IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. AND THE TAKE CARE OF THEIR EMOTIONAL NEEDS AND AND OTHER NEEDS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THAT THEY CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES -- ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE OUT ON STRIKE TEAM ASSIGNMENTS OR OR AS WE SAID I CAN'T GET HOME FOR FOUR WEEKS ON END -- AND SO THAT THAT IS A PROGRAM THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH OF ANOTHER VALUE TO THAT -- PROGRAM IS -- WE WE DEPLOY AT TRAILER THAT HAS THESE INDIVIDUALS IN IT -- AT LARGE LARGE AND EXTENDED FIRES -- THAT HAVE TEAMS ON THEM. AND AND THAT SERVICE IS AVAILABLE TO ALL OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS THAT WOULD BE LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- THE FEDERAL -- OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS -- OUT OF STATE RESOURCES IF THEY'RE HAVING ISSUES -- ANYBODY CAN GO TO THOSE THAT TRAILER AND GET THE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT NOW. THANK YOU IN AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON ON YOUR CONFIDENCE THE GOVERNOR HAS A NEW AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND WE DO AS WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE [inaudible] SENATOR BATES. LET ME ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MOM. THE GOOD SENATOR TO MY LEFT SENATOR MONEY -- ON AT YOUR APPOINTMENT AND JOB CERTAINLY THE RESPECT THAT YOU HAVE MOUNTED ACTUALLY -- THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME OF THAT IN TERMS TO YOUR BACKGROUND. I KNOW WHEN WE ON ME OUT TO MY OFFICE DIRECTOR. MICK CAN I CALL YOU THAT THAT'S NOT BAD LUCK RIGHT I'M A LITTLE FOR YOU SO YOU'RE IN ANYWAY -- ABOUT MY COMMUNITY THE SENATE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT HAVE -- SUFFERS IN YEARS PAST US SEVERELY WITH WILDLAND FIRES AND THE COMMUNITIES BILL TRIED OUT TO THAT -- INTERFACE SO DEFENSIBLE SPACE ISSUES ARE CERTAINLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CALIFORNIA OR TO ENSURE THAT. THAT IS BEING MAINTAINED AND COMMUNITIES COULD YOU SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY ON THE PEOPLE HERE ALL YOUR ROLE IN THAT AND GOD. IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE CERTAINLY -- IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY -- THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS BEEN ONGOING AND PROBABLY IS BEING RAMPED UP AS WE SEE WHAT HAPPENED WITHOUT THE LATEST WHILE BUYERS. ABSOLUTELY SENATOR AND AND THE THE THE IMPORTANCE OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- IS IS VERY CLEAR -- WHERE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS MAINTAINED -- AND THAT IT THAT IS AT THE LANDOWNERS EXPENSE AND LANDOWNERS ACTION -- WHERE IT IS MAINTAIN THE HOMES ARE LESS LIKELY TO BURN -- IT IS NOT A SILVER BULLET AS AS I MENTIONED NONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. OF THEIR OWN IS A SILVER BULLET. BUT DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS SOMETHING THE LANDOWNER CAN DO. AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT SO BY A US. AND AND AND I'M GONNA TALK TO THIS FROM THE CAL FIRE PERSPECTIVE AND THEN I'M GONNA ADD THE CONTRACT COUNTY PERSPECTIVE -- WHICH ORANGE COUNTY IS -- AN ORANGE COUNTY -- EFFECTIVELY IS CAL FIRE IN ORANGE COUNTY AND SO THAT'S THAT IF THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY. THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA SHOULD BE MAINTAINED AND THE INSPECTIONS THAT SHOULD BE DONE -- AND THEN THE FIRE FIGHTING IT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS SO -- THE OR ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY UNDER -- BRIAN FANTASY IS THEIR CIEF -- AND THEY I DO THE SAME INSPECTIONS THAT WE DO OFFER DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND WE ARE INSPECTING FOR COMPLAINTS WERE LOOKING TO GET COMPLIANCE. AND THE THE STATE WIDE -- GOAL IS -- TO HAVE AN ACTIVE INSPECTION GOING ON EVERY. HOME IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO WE DON'T HAVE THE THE CAPACITY. CURRENTLY TO DO EVERY SINGLE YEAR -- AND WE ARE OF WORKING TOWARD THE TARGET OF EVERY THIRD YEAR -- AND SO THAT IS OF IT'S IT'S A QUARTER OF A MILLION -- INSPECTIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVERY. YEAR ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT IS -- WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THAT SPACE? EXCELLENT I ACTUALLY ON THE FIRE AUTHORITY IN ORANGE COUNTY MAYBE IT'S BEST PRACTICES I'LL WORK THROUGH OUR AID ARE HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS. WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN FUEL MONIC MODIFICATIONS LAWNS. DOWN THERE DOING SOME REGULAR COMMUNICATION EDUCATION BECAUSE OUR OUR CERTAINLY LARGE DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE NOT IN EACH AWAY IS BUT THEY'VE STARTED TO TAKE THAT ON AND I THINK. THAT CERTAINLY BECAUSE YOU ALL OF WORK SO CLOSELY TOGETHER AND BEEN VERY MERITORIOUS AND YEAH AND GETTING PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND. THE DANGER THERE -- I ON A LAST QUESTION AND I IN ANOTHER ONE THAT WE DISCUSS WITH THEM REGARDING THE EVACUATION ROUTES. AND THE ASSISTANCE WITH THE RESOURCES FINANCIAL TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AS THE GOING FORWARD AND ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE THE MONEY WE HAD WHEN I WAS ON THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE HAD. TO NOT APPROVED -- A COUPLE OF PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY HAD PLANNED THAT. AND CERTAINLY THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRE THIRTY AT THAT TIME REGARDING THAT ISSUE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE SEQUEL -- REVIEW AND ALL THAT BUT I YOUR INTERFACE WITH THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAMPFIRE. SO COULD YOU ADDRESS HOW QUICKLY YOU'RE ABLE TO GET OUT THE RESOURCE OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES CAN BE THERE. FOR EXISTING AND CERTAINLY PLANNED FUTURE PLANNED COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE YOUR AND AND RELATED TO FUTURE COMMUNITIES -- THAT'S WHERE THE LAND USE PLANNING A PIECE OF WHAT I AM IN MY OPENING IS SO IMPORTANT. AND THE ENGAGING EARLY AND AND THE THE SAFETY ELEMENT OF OF GENERAL PLANS AND ENSURING THAT. FOR ALL SUBDIVISIONS AND DEVELOPMENT THAT'S GOING FORWARD THAT WE'RE MAKING SURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- AND AGAIN SO WE WE HAVE AN ADVISORY -- MECHANISM HERE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE TO THE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES -- THOSE PLANS DâN ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF FOREST AND FIRE PROTECTION -- THOSE SAFETY ELEMENTS AND THOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FOR SECONDARY ACCESS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF EGRESS WITH THE OF OF ROADS IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS NEED TO BE THERE ON IN. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT THEY ALSO -- NEED TO BE CONSIDERED STRONGLY WHEN WHEN REDEVELOPING AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY EITHER WILD FIRE. OR OTHER -- NATURAL OR MAN CAVE BECAUSE DISASTER [inaudible] AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE SEEING AND IN THE PARADISE EXAMPLE FROM THE CAMPFIRE. THE EVACUATION OF OF PARADISE KHôNG CAL MCGEE ELIA. OF WELL TRAGIC -- AND EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES IT WASN'T [inaudible] THROUGH THE MASS EVACUATION THAT THAT HAPPENED IT WAS FROM THE FIRE OVER RUNNING THE LOCATION OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN SOME CASES STUCK ON SOME OF THOSE ROADS. BUT IT WAS A IT WAS VERY MUCH SUCCESS -- SKYLINE -- IS A TWO LANE EACH DIRECTION SO FOUR LANE -- ROAD. THAT WAS TURNED INTO FOUR LANES GOING OUT OF TOWN. AND THEY PRACTICE THIS THEY ACTUALLY. DID A DRILL AND SWITCH THE DIRECTION OF THE ENTIRE SKYLINE TO FROM FROM -- PARADISE TO CHICO AND A PRACTICE. TO THE PEOPLE OF PARADISE KNEW WHAT TO DO. AND WHEN THAT TRIGGER WAS PULLED THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD THAT CORRIDOR -- THAT CORRIDOR WAS ALSO AN AREA WHERE A LOT OF FUEL REDUCTION WAS DONE ALONG ALONG THAT PART OF THE HIGHWAY. WELL THRE WERE THOUSANDS OF CARS ON SKYLINE HEADED OUT OF TOWN THE FIRE WAS PASSING THEM. DOWN BOTH SIDES OF THE OF THE HIGHWAY. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT MAKE IT OUT AND DOWN INTO CHICO -- AND LIKE I SAID INCREDIBLY. ONLY EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE PERISHED IN THAT FIRE. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AGAIN NOW CONGRATULATIONS LE YOU'RE CERTAINLY WELL PREPARED TO DO A GREAT JOB IN THIS NEW POSITIONS SO -- WE WISH YOU THE VERY BEST [inaudible] THANK YOU. SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU -- THANK YOU VENTURE. A SIR CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT [inaudible] INCREDIBLE RESUME [inaudible] WE HAVE. VERY INFORMATIVE CONVERSATION EARLIER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A POINT OR TWO THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND REMINDING MADE. A WITH RESPECT TO THE THE THE MENTAL WELL BEING OF YOUR FIRE CREWS YOU KNOW THE MILITARY'S GONE THROUGH THIS WITH DEPLOYMENT AFTER DEPLOYMENT -- AT HISTORIC RATES OF FAR BEYOND ANYTHING THAT -- I EVER KNEW WHEN I WAS IN THE SERVICE -- AND IT HAS HAD IT'S TAKING ITS TOLL ON MILITARY MEMBERS IN THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTS OF HAD. TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT -- MENTAL HEALTH OF PROGRAMS TO TRY TO DEAL WTH -- WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES THE HAS THE DEPARTMENT LOOKED TO THE MILITARY IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES. OF AS YOU WERE DOING YOUR REVIEW AND AND SETTING UP PROGRAMS -- TO DO WITH YOUR OWN. A SIGNIFICANT -- ISSUES. THANK YOU -- SEVEN ROTH FOR THAT -- IS STUPID -- COMMENT WE WE ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING TO THE MILITARY -- WE FOUND THAT. THE MILITARY -- REALLY HAS THE CLOSEST -- MODEL TO WHAT IT IS WE ARE DOING WITH WITH OUR EMPLOYEES -- THERE ARE OTHER STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE -- THAT HAVE. BEEN MORE OF DOMESTIC KIND OF RESPONSE TYPE OF OF STUDIES. BUT WHAT WHAT CAL FIRE IS DOING -- AND EVEN EVEN SURPASSES WHAT THE FOR SERVICES SEEING -- WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A A MORE -- FIXED ROTATION THAN THAN CAL FIRE DOES AND SO -- LOOKING AT AT PARTICULARLY -- THE MARINE CORPS AND AND SOME OF THE DEPLOYMENT A STUDY AND AND CONCERNS THAT THEY'VE. BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY -- WITH -- SUCCESSIVE DEPLOYMENTS AND AND LENGTH OF DEPLOYMENT. HAVE BEEN A PART OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TOWARD -- WORKING WITH THIS EMPLOYEE SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM -- THE OTHER THING THAT THAT WERE FINDING -- WHICH IS ALSO LIKE THE MILITARY IS SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND THEN -- WHAT THAT THEN CAUSES -- IN THE FUTURES FOR AS FAR AS ONCE YOU'RE SLEEP DEPRIVED IT'S HARDER TO GET BACK ON CYCLE AND YOU BECOME. OF MORE SLEEP DEPRIVED AND THEN IT CHANGES THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF OF OUR BODIES IT IT CHANGES. HOW OUR BODIES REACT -- TWO DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE STRESS -- CARRYING OF WEIGHT DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WHICH ACTUALLY I WAS TALKING WITH -- ARE -- CHIEF OF THE U. S. S. PROGRAM -- JUST THIS MORNING AND HE'S VERY MUCH -- LOOKING INTO. ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT -- THE STUDIES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE THAT ARE GOING TO BE HELPFUL IN IN HIS -- CRAFTING A PROGRAM THAT WILL. REALLY BE SPECIFIC TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE SITUATION THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE SEEING. I WAS. SEVEN IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT YOU'RE FIELDING FIELD SUPPORT UNITS WERE -- FIREFIGHTERS CAN COMMON. AND RECEIVE COUNSELING -- ONE QUESTION I DO HAVE OR A POINT IN A I WOULD HOPE THAT. WE'RE IN WE'RE NOT AS A WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO US I KNOW IN THE AS I RECALL IN THE MILITARY WE HAD A CONCEPT OF IT WE CALL BUDDY CARE. WHERE -- MILITARY MEMBERS WERE TRAINED TO OBSERVE SIGNS AND SIGNALS OF INDIVIDUALS IN DISTRESS. AND TO BRING THAT. ISSUE OR THE PEOPLE TO THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO CAN BEST DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT AS YOU'RE FORMULATING YOUR POLICIES YOU YOU LOOK TO THAT INTO TRAINING PROGRAMS TRAINING. YOUR FIRE CREWS TO TO WATCH FOR SIGNALS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO READ DISTRESS BECAUSE OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION -- LENGTHY DEPLOYMENTS ARE TIME AWAY FROM FAMILIES. SO THAT IF THOSE INDIVIDUALS DON'T SELF IDENTIFY FOR WHATEVER REASON -- PRESSURE THAT EXISTS OUT THERE WE GET THEM. TO THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE WHO CAN PROVIDE THE CARE NECESSARY. SENATORS THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND BODY CARE. YOUR SUPPORT -- IS WHAT WE TYPICALLY USE AS AS OUR TERM -- BUT IT'S THE SAME AND IT'S IT'S WATCHING OUT FOR BROTHERS AND SISTERS. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN. AND THAT THERE'S NO STIGMA IN DOING SO. AND I'VE SEEN -- IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF MY CAREER AND A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. IN PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO BE OPEN AND TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THEY'RE HAVING -- AND REALLY WORK THROUGH -- ISSUES AND AND REACH OUT TO OUR EMPLOYEE SUPPORT SERVICES -- IN SOME CASES IN TWO EAP -- AS WELL WHEN THEY GET HOME. BUT I'M SEEING A MUCH MORE OPEN -- GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT I THAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY -- IN MY CAREER AND IT'S IT'S IT'S HARDENING -- IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF TIMES BUT IT IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S A FEEL LIKE WE'RE AT A PLACE WHERE THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME. I REALLY ENJOY THESE THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS THIS IS. THE IF I DO NOTHING ELSE AS DIRECTOR. AMONG. THE WORK TO FIX OUR EMPLOYEES. GREAT AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION. TO ENSURE THAT YOU AND YOUR DEPARTMENT OR APPROPRIATELY RESOURCE.
