THE MASTER IN THE ART OF LIVING MAKES LITTLE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WORK AND PLAY. BETWEEN LABOR AND LEISURE BETWEEN THEIR MIND IN THEIR BODY. BETWEEN INFORMATION AND RECREATION. BETWEEN LOVE AND RELIGION. THE MASTER OF THE ART OF LIVING HARDLY KNOWS WHICH IS WHICH. HE SIMPLY PURSUE THEIR VISION OF EXCELLENCE AT WHATEVER THEY DO.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE BY SOME A MEMBER LOW AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY UNLAWFUL BUSINESS PRACTICES. THANK YOU THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE WHICH DOES ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY. IT CODIFIES EXISTING COURT DECISIONS AND CLARIFIES THAT CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMER FRAUD LAWS. BAR THE LONG DISCREDITED IN HARMFUL PRACTICE OF CONVERSION THERAPY. IT'S FALSELY PROMISES TO BE ABLE A CHANGE ONE'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY. THE BILL IS EXPRESS. IN ITS TERMS OF LIMITING THE PRACTICE OF CONVERSION THERAPY AS A COMMERCIAL SERVICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MONETARY COMPENSATION. DOES NOT APPLY. TO THE SALE OF BOOKS. OR ANY OTHER KINDS OF GOODS IT DOES NOT PREVENT ANYONE FROM SPEAKING OR WRITING ON THE SUBJECT. OF CONVERSION THERAPY IN ANY FORM WITH RESPECT I ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER OUR QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU SO MUCH. OF MYSTERY AUTHOR OR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW. AS THERE'S A LOT OF US OPINIONS SWIRLING IN A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL. ESPECIALLY. IN SOMETHING THAT I AM CONNECTED TO THAT WOULD BE THE FAITH COMMUNITY. YOUR BILL HOW DOES THAT IMPACT OF THE FAITH COMMUNITY HOW DOES IT IMPACT CHURCHES AND HOW WOULD IT IMPACT THE CURRENT PRACTICES THAT THEY DO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS DOES NOT A IMPACT OF WITH RESPECT TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH OR FREEDOM OF RELIGION. OF THIS IS VERY NARROW IN SCOPE UNDER THEIR CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT WHICH IS THAT OF A FINANCES TRANSACTION. SO IF YOU ARE IN A CHURCH AND THEY STILL WOULD LIKE TO PREACH WHATEVER THE BELIEVES MIGHT BE. OF THAT IS STILL LEGAL AND ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW A BUT ONE CANNOT BE ADVERTISE WITH THE TRANSACTION TO MAKE A PROFIT. THIS NOTION THAT YOU CAN BE CHANGED. WITH RESPECT TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND SEXUAL IDENTITY SO TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS VERY NARROW IN SCOPE UNDER THIS CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT. IS THAT OF A CONSUMER TRANSACTION. YOU CAN STILL TALK ABOUT THAT BELIEVES OF WHATEVER THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION MIGHT BE. AND THAT IS STILL POSSIBLE IN FACT IT IS ALSO STILL POSSIBLE FOR WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A CHURCH TO TALK ABOUT THAT THEY CAN CHANGE YOU. SO LONG AS THAT THERE IS NOT A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR I I BELIEVE THAT IF PASSED AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR I'D THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD BE. A OVERTURNED INDEED BY A HIGHER COURT ARE ON THE GROUNDS OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND REGARDS TO THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION. FREEDOM OF SPEECH WHERE THE PRESS AND THE RIGHT TO FREELY ASSEMBLE. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL. STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT CONVERSION THERAPY IS INEFFECTIVE AND DAMAGING. SCIENCE IN FACT SHOW THAT BEING LGBT Q. IS NOT A DISEASE OR DISORDER OR AN ILLNESS. ARE LGBT Q.. CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO FRAUDULENT PRACTICES WHICH COULD POSE CRITICAL HEALTH RISKS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MA'AM SPEAKER MEMBERS. RISING I THINK IS THE ONLY LICENSED CLINICAL. PRACTITIONER IN THIS HOUSE I WILL JUST SAY THAT THIS LIKE A PRACTICE THAT HAS LONG BEEN DISCREDITED. NOBODY GOES TO A PROFESSIONAL THERAPIST I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET CHANGE FROM THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. FRAUDULENT SHOULD NOT BE OCCURRING IT IS DAMAGING TO PEOPLE AND FOR THOSE WHO STILL HAVE WORD ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT YOU CAN STILL TRY TO PRAY THE GAY AWAY IF YOU'D LIKE. UP BUT BUT WE HASN'T PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE AND CERTAINLY IF YOU GO SEE CA LICENSED PERSON WHO IS LICENSED UNDER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE. PSYCHOTHERAPY TREATMENT ADVERTISE IT YOU CAN CHANGE SEVENTY SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS SIMPLY THAT FRAUDULENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I LARGE FAITH BASED COMMUNITY IN MY DISTRICT AND AGAIN SOME THE CONCERNS OVER REITERATED FOR THE AREA OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. MORE SPECIFICALLY IN AREAS OF LITERATURE SO SO NUMBER IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. WITHOUT OBJECTIVELY DO LIKE TO DO THAT NOW OR IN YOUR CLOTHES I'M JUST CLARIFICATION OF WHAT THE QUESTION WAS ASSEMBLYMEMBER. UP IN THE AREA OF THE LITERATURE IN THE AREA OF BOOKS HOUSE OF IMPACT. FOR SOME OF. I WILL ASK YOU TO ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR CLOTHING RATHER THAN NOW THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT CLAIMING TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE A PERSON'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION. OR GENDER IDENTITY AND EXCHANGE FOR PAYMENT IS A FRAUDULENT BUSINESS PRACTICE. THAT MISLEADS CONSUMERS AND EXPOSES LGBT PEOPLE. TO DAMAGING PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT LGBT IS PART OF THE NATURAL SPECTRUM OF HUMAN IDENTITY. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG OR BROKEN WITH THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS BANNED CONVERSION THERAPY IS A PRACTICE FOR MINORS IT IS STILL BEING PRACTICED ON ADULTS EVEN THOUGH CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE RECOGNIZES THAT LGBT IS PART OF THE NATURAL SPECTRUM OF HUMAN IDENTITY? AND IS NOT A DISEASE DISORDER OR ILLNESS. AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE THAT OF A CONSUMER SUFFERS DAMAGES AS A RESULT OF THESE HARMFUL PRACTICES THEN THE CONSUMER COULD BRING AN ACTION TO RECOVER THOSE DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE DOES NOT TOUCH ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH OR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM BECAUSE IT SIMPLY PUTS CONVERSION THERAPY. ON THE SAME LEVEL AS OTHER FRAUDULENT SERVICES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE. THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES KNOW WHAT TO BE ABLE TO PROFIT FROM THEM. A CONVERSION THERAPY IS A FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY THAT HAS NO SCIENTIFIC BASIS. I AM THINKING ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND AND ALSO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. MADE TIMES ARE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MISLED BY THINGS THAT THEY HEAR THAT THEY THINK I MIGHT BE TRUER MIGHT BE ACCURATE IN THIS YEAR I INTRODUCED A BILL. THAT WOULD HELP US SUPPORT LGBT STUDENTS TO HELP THEM NOT BE IMPACTED BY BULLYING OR IMPACTED BY THINGS THAT MIGHT CAUSE HARM TO THEM. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR RUSTED THE CLEAR THAT THIS IS A FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY AND THAT THERE ARE PENALTIES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD PROFIT OFF OF IT. AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE I THINK AND I I THINK THE REASON WHY. IT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE IS BECAUSE IT GOES TO THE VERY. CENTER OF PEOPLE'S IDENTITY. AND AND WHO THEY ARE WHO THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE. AND SO I AM VERY MUCH HEARD MY COLLEAGUE ACTUALLY OTHERS. IN IN COMMITTEE WHEN THE WHEN THE BILL WAS UP. AND DEFTLY HEARD. FROM HIM THE HURT AND YOU KNOW THE. THE OSTRACIZE ASIAN THAT MANY FEEL. MANY IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY OF FELT. BECAUSE OF. MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED ESPECIALLY AS BEING A YOUNG PERSON AND. AND ON AND STRUGGLING WITH ISSUES OF OF IDENTITY. AND SO I VERY MUCH FEAR THAT I SEE IN A. NO THAT THAT'S THE MOTIVATION. BEHIND YOUR BILL. BUT I THINK THE THING THAT. THAT I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER YOU AS HE'S MOVING FORWARD HIS BILL IS. IS CONSIDERING THE VERY GENUINE I THINK LEGITIMATE EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE WHO WHO TESTIFIED IN THAT COMMITTEE. AND THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THAT HELP THEM. AND THAT WORK FOR THEM. I'M I BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE WERE VERY I MEAN. HEARING THAT TESTIMONY WAS VERY POWERFUL AS WELL. AND AND THAT. FREEDOM IF IT MEAN SOMETHING IT MEANS IT MEANS AND. THE BILL WOULD BE FREE TO BE WHO YOU ARE. TOM AND I THINK IT ALSO MUST ALSO MEAN. FREEDOM TO BE WHO YOU WANT TO BE. AND I THINK FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW WHO HAVE TESTIFIED AND HAVE HAVE COME FORWARD DOOR AS THIS BILL IS MOVE FORWARD. THEY WOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU THAT THIS IS WHO THEY ARE. AND. I THINK WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT EXPERIENCE IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE RIGHT. WHERE IT'S BEEN VERY HURTFUL IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DAMAGING BUT FOR THOSE PEOPLE I THINK WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT LIVING IN A FREE SOCIETY IS IS THE FREEDOM? THE PEOPLE THAT DO THINGS THAT MAYBE WE THINK ARE NOT THE BEST. MAYBE THAT WE THINK ARE HER FULLER DAMAGES I THINK THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE LEGITIMATE EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE. WHO HAVE? GONE THROUGH CONVERSION THERAPY AND HAVE SET HAVES AND HAVES. AT HAVE SAID THAT THIS WAS A GOOD THING FOR THEM THE OTHER THING I THINK WE HAVE TO CONSIDER IS. IS POTENTIALLY APPLICATION FOR FOR THE FAITH COMMUNITY. AND I THINK MAYBE THIS BEARS A LITTLE BIT OF EXPLANATION IS. CHRISTIANS DO BELIEVE AND. THEY BELIEVE IN SPIRITUAL TRANSFORMATION. CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ALL. SINNERS WE WE ALL EQUALLY FALLS SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT CHRIST DID ON THE CROSS. WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A NEW HEART AND WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A SPIRIT. THAT TRANSFORMS US. AND SO CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THEY PRACTICE THAT IN THEIR FAITH. NOT EVERYBODY PRACTICES THAT FAITH NOBODY SAYING THAT. ANYBODY. IS GONNA BE FORCED TO PRACTICE. THAT FAITH. BUT THEY LEGITIMATELY PACKS THAT FAITH IN THERE ARE BOOKS THERE ARE. CONFERENCES THERE ARE. AREAS WHERE THERE COULD BE. A TRANSACTION INVOLVES. BUT ARE LEGITIMATE PRACTICES OF. OF A FAITH. AND. LET ME JUST SAY THIS YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SAN I BELIEVE HOMOPHOBIA IS A SIN. I BELIEVE OSTRACIZING A GROUP AND MALIGNING A GROUP AND SLANDERING A GROUP. IS A SIN. AND SO LOOK AS AS CHRISTIANS PRACTICING WE ARE TRYING TO. WE ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE AGAINST SIN AND AND WE BELIEVE. THAT'S OUR THAT IS OUR PERSONALLY HELD BELIEF. THAT GOD CAN CHANGE US. GOD I HOPE WE CAN CHAINS HAVE HOPE BEACON CHANGES ASSEMBLY MEMBER I ASK YOU TO PLEASE REFER. KEEP YOUR COMMENTS THE MERITS OF THE BILL OKAY. I'M A WORK IN PROGRESS MYSELF. AND SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT TIME YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS. THAT THESE COULD BE MUCH BROADER AND AND GO INTO. YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL I SAID LIKE TO WORK ON. CERTAINLY TIGHTENING THAT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T INFRINGE UPON LEGITIMATE PRACTICES OF OUR FAITH. AND NOT JUST CHRISTIAN FAITH BUT. MUSLIMS AND YOU PEOPLE OF MANY DIFFERENT FAITHS HAVE BELIEFS THAT WE THAT WE IN THIS BODY MAY NOT SHARE A MAJORITY IN THIS BODY MAY NOT SHARE BUT DO WE WANT TO START DOWN THE PATH. I KNOW I HAVE A COLLEAGUES IS I HATE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENTS BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY WE'VE COINED THE TREE PHRASE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENTS BECAUSE ONCE YOU START DOWN THE PATH OTHER THINGS COULD COME UP. WHERE PEOPLE SAY ISN'T THIS THE SAME JUSTIFICATION WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT AND SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT WE CONSIDER? THE LEGITIMATE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE. CALIFORNIANS FAMILY MEMBER TEN MORE SECONDS PLEASE. AND POTENTIALLY THE IMPLICATIONS TO. FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. I WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU. AND ON YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THAT AND I WOULD JUST ASK FOR THAT GOING FORWARD. THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK MEASURE UP WANTED TO JUST FURTHER. EXPLORE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN. WHAT'S YOUR BILL DOESN'T AND COMMERCIALIZATION PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO BOOKS AND TAPES AND OTHER THINGS. THAT ARE PRODUCED BY RELIGIOUS ENTITIES WHO HAVE A POINT OF VIEW THAT THIS KIND OF THEIR TO THERAPY IS LEGITIMATE THAT THEY. ARE. COUNCIL ARE IN IN IN THEIR CHURCHES THEY PROVIDE. OF. COMMERCIAL. I. TRANSACTIONS BUT THAT'S OFTENTIMES WITH IN THE SETTING. OF A NON COMMERCIAL A ORGANIZATION. I'M MEANING UP A BOOK OR A TAPE OR. THE OFFER OF THAT KIND OF THERAPY IN. THE WALLS OF THE CHURCH. OUR WE WOULD HAVE A SOME KIND OF A PRICE TAG TO IT TO DEFRAY COSTS ORDER. THE OTHERWISE HAPPY. COULD YOU PLEASE ADDRESS THAT DIRECTLY. WITH RESPECT TO MOVING THIS. POINT OF VIEW AND THIS THERAPY. INTO A CLASS. OF SPEECH AND COMMENTARY. THAT IS PROHIBITED FROM BEING COMMERCIALLY. I UTILIZED. THAT QUESTION TO THE TO THE AUTHOR I'M GONNA ASK HIM TO ADDRESS THAT IN HIS CLOTHES. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CONSUMER RIGHTS SECTION. AND AS THE PROSECUTOR OF THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT. DOES NOT PROHIBIT. BANDING. FRAUDULENT CONDUCT. THE FAITH COMMUNITY LIKE ANYONE ELSE. NEEDS TO INVOLVE. WITH THE TIMES. THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SUPPORT LIST IT INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION THEM AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. SO. THE CLAIM THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT CAN BE USED AS A DEFENSE. FOR. PROMOTING. FRAUDULENT CONDUCT. IS A FALLACIOUS ARGUMENT. I SEE NO FURTHER WRITTEN DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THEY GIVE VERY MUCH MENACE SPEAKER I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE AND TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SPECIFIC. CONCERNS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSED. IT THE BILL SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL THERAPIES WHICH PROVIDE ACCEPTANCE SUPPORT UNDERSTANDING OF CLIENTS FACILITATION OF CLIENTS COPING. SOCIAL SUPPORT IDENTITY EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING SEXUAL ORIENTATION NEUTRAL INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT OR ADDRESS INDIVIDUAL CONTACT OR UNSAFE SEXUAL PRACTICES. IN ADDITION TO WITH RESPECT TO THAT OF SALE BOOKS THIS IS NOT DEFINED WITH RESPECT TO PRACTICES. UNDER THE BILL THIS IS SPECIFICALLY TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE PRACTICES WHICH IS CONSUMER WHICH IS BAD OF CONVERSION THERAPY PRACTICES. SO THE SALE. OF THE BOOK IS NOT THE ACTUAL PRACTICE. MEMBERS OF I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSEMBLY GIVE EXAMPLE WITH. YOUR. INDULGENCE MADAM SPEAKER WITHOUT OBJECTION. THIS ORANGE. IF I TELL YOU. THAT THIS ORANGE. WE'LL HELP YOU GROW A FOOT TALLER. TOMORROW IF YOU READ IT. AND I GIVE THIS TO YOU. THAT IS OF. YOU KNOW THAT IT WILL NOT. HELP YOU GROW AND ADDITIONAL FOOT. NOW. IF I TOLD YOU. THIS I WANT MAKE YOU GROW ADDITIONAL FOOT. AND I GIVE THIS TO YOU AND ASK YOU TO PAY ME FIFTY CENTS. THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. MAKES THIS A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE. IF I GIVE THIS TO YOU. THAT IS THE LEGAL. MEMBERS WE EARLIER. THIS MONTH PASSED A RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. AND I'VE I'VE I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY OF YOU IN PARTICULAR MEMBERS ACROSS THE AISLE. IN WHICH THIS DOES ENJOY BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. YOU KNOW ME. I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH. I'VE CONVERSATIONS WITH INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE AISLE AND OF OTHER FAITHS. THIS IS A VERY. PERSONAL ISSUE TO ME. NO WHICH IT RECALLS BACK IN TIME VERY DARK TYPE. IN WHICH GROWING UP. IT'S SO MUCH HATE. THAT AYE WHICH YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT IF I COULD BE CHANGED. IF ANYTHING COULD WORK. BECAUSE OF THE SOCIETAL PRESSURES THAT WE HAVE. NOW IS WE FIND OURSELVES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE STATE LEGISLATURE WITH AN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT EVERYONE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG. WITH ME. THERE IS NOTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. ARE YOUR BROTHERS. ARE YOUR SISTERS. ARE YOUR PARENTS. OUR PASTORS. POLICE OFFICERS. AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN. WE ARE A FAMILY. SO THIS NOTION. THAT WE WOULD ACCEPT. AT A PRACTICE OF THE LEGAL PRACTICE THAT CONVERGE THERAPY WORKS. IS ANTI FEDERAL CALL TO MY VERY EXISTENCE. BODY. AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW. IN THIS MOMENT OF VULNERABILITY. TO WHICH THEY ARE TO TRYING TO FIND THEMSELVES AND COME OUT. IN A SOCIETY THAT IS VERY HATEFUL TO THAT. AND A MOMENT OF VULNERABILITY. COULD I TO CHANGE.

TO MADAM CLERK PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE OF THE TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BAKER AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY THE MANDATED REPORTERS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BAKER. SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. UP MEMBERS I RISE TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI TWENTY THREE OH TO. A BILL THAT WILL FIX THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IN OUR LAW THAT EXPOSES KIDS TO FURTHER CHILD ABUSE AND IN PARTICULAR SEXUAL ASSAULT. JUST TWO WEEKS AGO WE MET FOR EXTRAORDINARY COURAGEOUS WOMEN I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM. JENNETTE ANSEL AND FORMER U. S. GYMNASTICS TEAM MEMBER WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE PAN AMERICAN GAMES AND HELP THE U. S. WON A SILVER MEDAL. JAMIE DOWNSHIRE FORMER U. S. GYMNASTICS TEAM MEMBER A BRONZE MEDALIST IN THE TWO THOUSAND SUMMER OLYMPICS IN SYDNEY. JORDYN WIEBER SHE WAS ONE OF THE FEARS FIVE ALONG WITH GABBY DOUGLAS MCKAYLA MARONEY ALY RAISMAN KYLA ROSS WHO WON GOLD MEDALS IN TWENTY TWELVE SUMMER OLYMPICS IN LONDON. AND TIFFANY THOMAS LOPEZ FORMER SOFTBALL PLAYER FROM MICHIGAN STATE SHE WAS A TOP TEAM NATIONAL PROSPECT UPON HER ARRIVAL AT MICHIGAN STATE. EACH ONE OF THESE WOMEN WE WERE INTRODUCED TO WHEN WE WERE ON THE FLOOR TWO WEEKS AGO THEY WERE UP IN THE GALLERY. AND THEY WERE ALL VICTIMS OF DOCTOR LARRY NASSER. WHO? SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND ABUSED THEM AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OTHER GIRLS ATHLETES INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES. NOW DOCTOR NASSER IS GOING TO JAIL. BUT THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY WHO SUSPECTED. THAT THERE WAS CHILD ABUSE OF THESE GIRLS AND THEY DID NOTHING. AND THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION UNDER THE LAW TO THEY WERE MANDATED REPORTERS THEY WERE OBLIGATED WHEN THEY SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT TO LET LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW. AND THEY DID NOTHING. AND DINNER MICHIGAN LAW WHICH HAS A TERRIBLE FLAW. THEY OF THE VICTIMS HAD NO RECOURSE. I MET WITH THOSE FOR WOMEN THEY ARE CALIFORNIANS. THEY LIVE IN OUR STATE. AND THEY LEARNS THAT BECAUSE OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE MANDATED REPORTERS. ONLY HAD ONE YEAR IN WHICH THEY HAD TO REPORT SUSPECTED ABUSE AND IF THEY DIDN'T THEY WERE FREE TO GO. WE HAVE THE SAME FLAW IN OUR CALIFORNIA LAW. AND IT'S GOING TO HARM OUR KIDS IF WE DON'T FIX IT. THIS BILL FIXES THAT FLAW. UNDER EXISTING LAW IF YOU'RE A MANDATED REPORTER IN CALIFORNIA NEW SUSPECTED CHILD IS BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. YOU HAVE AND THE MOMENT THAT YOU FIND THAT OUT AND YOU SUSPECTED THE CLOCK BEGINS TO TECH AND YOU HAVE ONE YEAR TO REPORT IT. OR YOUR A AND AFTER THAT YOU'RE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY CRIME WHICH IS A MISDEMEANOR IN A THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE. WHAT HAPPENS IS THE ONE YEAR GOES BY VERY FAST IT'S NOT A RECURRING PENALTY? AND THE ABUSE CAN CONTINUE WELL BEYOND THAT ONE YEAR AND THOSE KIDS ARE NOT PROTECTED THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN MICHIGAN. THIS BILL FIXES THAT BY CHANGING THE STATURE LIMITATION START PERIOD TO AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FINDS OUT THERE'S BEEN CHILD ABUSE IT DOESN'T CHANGE TO MISDEMEANOR IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FINE IT DOESN'T CHANGE WHO A MANDATED REPORTER IS. AND DOESN'T CHANGE THE STANDARDS TO WHICH THEY ARE COMPARED IT MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A CONTINUING OBLIGATION TO REPORT THE CRIME BECAUSE. FOR THOSE GIRLS AND FOR CHILD ABUSE VICTIMS THE ABUSE CONTINUES. SO MEMBERS WE ARE GONNA VISIT LATER THIS MORNING ABOUT HOW WE CAN PREVENT CHILD ABUSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE WAYS WE CAN DO IT BY TOUGHENING OUR LAWS WITH RESPECT TO MANDATED REPORTERS. AND UP MEMBERS WHEN THOSE OLYMPIC ATHLETES THAT I MET TWO WEEKS AGO AND I VISITED WITH THEM AND I TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS BILL. THEY SAID I WISHED THAT BILL WERE LAW IN MICHIGAN I WISH I HAD THIS PROTECTIONS I WISH THOSE MANDATED REPORTERS NOT ONLY.

WEARING MODELED MOTORCYCLE RELATED PARAPHERNALIA CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM IN OUR STATE. SPIKE CLAIMS OTHERWISE IN FACT A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SURVEY OF CALIFORNIA MOTORCYCLE RIDERS CONCLUDED THAT NEARLY HALF OF THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED. FELT THEY HAD BEEN A VICTIM OF PROFILING OR AN UNJUSTIFIED TRAFFIC STOP AT LEAST ONCE. USING PROFILING METHODS TO ORCHESTRATE STOPS. AND UNLAWFUL DETENTION SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED IN THIS SOCIETY WHERE THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF BOTH OUR STATE IN U. S. CONSTITUTIONS AND ANTI DISCRIMINATION PRACTICES ARE VALUED AND UPHELD. THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE USE OF GENERALIZED STEREOTYPES THAT ARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT A PERSON RIDING A MOTORCYCLE. OUR IS WEARING CERTAIN MOTORCYCLE CLOTHING. CYCLISTS REPORT BEING STOPPED AND QUESTIONED WITH THE OFFICERS COLLECTING PERSONAL DATA SUCH AS TAKING PICTURES OF INSIGNIA PATCHES AND TATTOOS.
