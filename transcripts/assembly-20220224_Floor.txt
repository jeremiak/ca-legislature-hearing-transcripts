THE LEGAL SUBJUGATION BEATING AND BREAKING A BLACK BODY. REFLECT ON THE CIVIL WAR JUNETEENTH. THE BLACK COAT. HERE IN THIS BODY IT'S IMPORTANT WE REFLECT. ON THE FACT THAT DESPITE NOT BEING A SLAVE STATE DRACONIAN FUGITIVE SLAVE LAWS IN EXISTENCE. AND TO THIS DAY WE SPEND MORE MONEY INCARCERATING BLACK PEOPLE THAN NEARLY ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION. WE CAN'T TURN A COLOR BLIND EYE TO THE ANTI BLACKNESS. THAT IS PRODUCING ON HEALTH POPULATION. THAT IS NEARLY SEVEN TIMES BLACK OF THE GENERAL POPULATION.

I'M GRATEFUL TO CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY MONTH. WITH ALL OF YOU MY FIRST BLACK HISTORY MONTH IN THIS BODY. AND HUMBLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ON ACR ONE FORTY THREE. AND AFTER THE ROLE BE LEFT OPEN FOR COLON. ANY QUESTION OF EIGHT MEMBERS ARE RECOGNIZED. I SAW. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF A CA ARE ONE FORTY THREE THE BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES SHARE A LONG HISTORY OF JOINT STRUGGLE AND RESILIENCE. WE HAVE STOOD IN SOLIDARITY WITH EACH OTHER TO ACHIEVE PROGRESS IN EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND MANY OTHERS ISSUES UNIQUELY IMPACTING BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES. SIMILARLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE GRIEVED TOGETHER HAVING EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST RATES OF COVERT NINETEEN RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATH. WE ARE STILL HEALING FROM THE LOSSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND TOGETHER WE ARE UPLIFTING ONE ANOTHER TO CREATE A BRIGHTER MORE JUST FUTURE. IN ADDITION THIS MONTH WE REFLECT ON THE INTERSECTION ALITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY TWENTY ONE P. REPORT CALIFORNIA IS NOW THE THIRD TOP STATE OF RESIDENCE FOR AFRO LATINOS IN THE COUNTRY. WE CELEBRATE THOSE IN OUR STATE WHO IDENTIFY AS AFRO LATINO AND HIGHLIGHT THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS WELL. EVERY FEBRUARY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE VAST CONTRIBUTIONS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS IMPARTED ON OUR GREAT STATE. AND WE RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO IMPROVING OUR COMMUNITIES TOGETHER. ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'M VERY PROUD TO RISE OF THE HEALTH OF THE DPR LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF ACR. ONE FORTY THREE. WALL ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE BEEN HERE IN THE STATES OF. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GOLD RUSH OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS AGO. WE'VE PRIMARILY BEEN COMING SINCE IMMIGRATION REOPENED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. WHILE MANY ASIAN AMERICANS STOOD ARM IN ARM WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS DURING. THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE IN THE FIFTIES IN THE SIXTIES. REALLY THE BULK OF OUR- IMMIGRATION GROWTH ABOUT POPULATION GROWTH HAS REALLY BEEN AFTERWARDS. AND SO WHILE WE'VE. EDUCATE MANY OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT THE BENEFITS THAT WE ALL GET BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE DIED IN FOUGHT PROTESTERS DURING THOSE VERY YEARS TO GET UP TO GET MORE EQUITY. TO GET MORE OPENNESS TO GET MORE FAIRNESS WHERE THERE WAS A HOUSING WITH EDUCATION WITH THERE'S AN EMPLOYMENT IN EVERY FACET OF AMERICAN LIFE THAT TRADITIONALLY. WAS CLOSED. SO ON THIS DAY THIS IS VERY MUCH MY HONOR TO RISE. IN RECOGNITION OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH BECAUSE BLACK HISTORY IS REALLY AMERICAN HISTORY IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE. A SEPARATE MONTH BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS HISTORY HAS BEEN EXCLUDED. IT IS WHY WE'VE ALL STAYED HERE LAST COUPLE YEARS TALKING ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES. IMPORTANCE OF REALLY NERD LEARNING ABOUT OUR HISTORY. BECAUSE SO MUCH OF IT IS NOT FOUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS HOW MUCH IS NOT TAUGHT IN OUR UNIVERSITIES. THE STRUGGLES. THAT WE GOT TO THIS POINT. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES A LOT OF PEOPLE FALL IN A LOT OF PEOPLE. RISKED THEIR LIVELIHOODS TO ENSURE. THAT THE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY. WITH A BETTER PLACE. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE ON ACR. ONE FIFTY EIGHT. OR FORTY THREE. THANK YOU MISTER TANG MISSED MENIER AT YOUR DEATH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER TODAY I AM VERY PROUD TO RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE FORTY THREE DESIGNATING FEBRUARY AS BLACK HISTORY MONTH. EVERY DAY IN FEBRUARY WE ARE THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE STRUGGLE OF BLACK AMERICANS WE'RE TRULY AS HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT AND APPRECIATED EVERY SINGLE DAY CLEARLY THEY HAVE NOT. AS WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT TOWARDS A MORE JUST FUTURE WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT OUR COUNTRY CONTINUES TO HONOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY OF BLACK AMERICANS. NOW WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE INFLUENTIAL BLACK LEADERS AT A PAVE THE WAY TOWARDS EQUALITY AND JUSTICE MARTIN LUTHER KING. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND MANY MANY OTHERS BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO EVERY SINGLE DAY STRUGGLE PEROT KLAY AND WORK TOWARDS THE BETTERMENT OF THEIR COMMUNITY AND ALL OF AMERICA AND OFTEN THAT STRUGGLE. AND THAT WORK GOES ON HE DID. THERE ARE THOSE AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE TO FACE THOSE STRUGGLES EVERY DAY AND HISTORICALLY AND THIS IS THE MONTH WHERE THEY ARE CELEBRATED. BLACK HISTORY MONTH ALLOWS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON OUR COUNTRY'S PAST BUT REMINDS US THAT WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO. NO HISTORICALLY JEWISH COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN. A LARGE VOICE AN ALLY IN THE STRUGGLE FOR INTEGRATION. BOTH IN HOUSING AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND PARTICULARLY FOR THE INTEGRATION OF WORKPLACES AND FOR THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE. IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES A SMALL CHAU UNION CALLED LOCAL ELEVEN NINETY NINE LED BY JEWISH ACTIVISTS LEON DATE DAVIS WORKED ALONGSIDE BLACK IMPORTER RICAN HOSPITAL WORKERS IN NEW YORK AS THEY STRUGGLE TO ORGANIZE. AND I'LL TAKE A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIDE AND MENTIONED MY OWN COUSIN ARTHUR OSMAN. THE FIRST COUSIN OF MY GRANDFATHER ROBERT OSMAN. AND A FAMILY PHOTO WE HAVE OF HIM THAT'S THAT'S VISIBLE ON THE INTERNET- MARCHING WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING AS HE WORKED TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST UNIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. GOING WAY BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND FORTIES TO INTEGRATE AS JEWS WERE HAVING THEIR OWN STRUGGLE TO PROTECT THEIR OWN WORKERS AS RECENT IMMIGRANTS INTO THE UNITED STATES. AND THOSE WHO WERE FLEEING THE HOLOCAUST IN THE SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST FACING THEIR OWN ADVERSITY. THEY ALSO REACHED OUT TO THEIR BLACK NEIGHBORS TO SAY WE HAVE A SHARED STRUGGLE WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON IN THIS FIGHT. AGAINST OTHER NESS AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT AND THEY WORKED ARM IN ARM WITH BLACK LEADERS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT FOR THE RIGHTS OF ALL WORKERS AND ALL AMERICANS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. MANY OF US IN THE JEWISH CMMUNITY C. AS A GREAT SOURCE OF PRIDE AND OF INSPIRATION. I ALSO WANT TO CELEBRATE TODAY AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THE VOICES OF THE BLACK JEWISH COMMUNITY AND AS THE MOTHER OF A BLACK TO. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL TO ME- AND A SOURCE AGAIN OF PRIDE FOR SO MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE BLACK JEWS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY BOTH HERE IN AMERICA. AND ABROAD IN ISRAEL AND ETHIOPIA AND SO MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD. WITHOUT AYE URGENT AYE VOTE ON ACR ONE FORTY THREE AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THE RESOLUTION FORWARD. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN THIS WHEREVER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. GOOD MORNING MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. AND IS A PROUD POLL AUTHOR IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE FORTY THREE TO RECOGNIZE FEBRUARY AS BLACK HISTORY MONTH. ACK MONTH IS AN IMPORTANT TIME FOR US TO ALL REFLECT ON THE RICH CONTRIBUTIONS BLACK PEOPLE HAVE MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH REMINDS US NOT JUST HOW FAR WE'VE TRAVELED BUT ALSO HOW FAR WE MUST GO. WE CANNOT CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY MONTH WITHOUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THEIR RESILIENCE STRENGTH AND CONTRIBUTIONS A BLACK WOMAN. BLACK WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AT THE FRONT LINES OF EVERY MOVEMENT WHETHER IT WAS THE ABOLITION MOVEMENT CIVIL RIGHTS SUFFRAGE MOVEMENTS LGBTQ RIGHTS AND SO MANY MORE. AND YET WE ARE ALL OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED FOR OUR PIVOTAL ROLE. NAMES SUCH AS SOJOURNER TRUTH IDA B. WELLS HELLO BAKER AND SHIRLEY CHISHOLM IMMEDIATELY COME TO MIND. THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO NATIONAL BLACK HISTORY THEME IS BLACK HEALTH AND WELLNESS. AND I BELIEVE THIS THEME IS FITTING TO LIFT UP THE NAME REBECCA LEE CRUMPLER. AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ALL COME TO KNOW THIS NAME AND FIGURE. DR CRUMPLER WAS THE FIRST BLACK FEMALE PHYSICIAN IN THE UNITED STATES. OPENING HER PRACTICE IN BOSTON IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR. DR CUMPLIR PAVE THE WAY FOR SO MANY BLACK FEMALE PHYSICIANS TO EXIST TODAY. INCLUDING ME. TODAY WOMEN REPRESENT 35% F ALL DOCTORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY BLACK WOMEN PHYSICIANS STILL ONLY RENT REPRESENT 223% THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HISTORY HOW HIS REMINDER OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME BUT HOW FAR WE MUST STILL GO. EXPERIENCING BLACK HISTORY EVERY YEAR REMINDS US THAT HISTORY IS NOT DEAD OR DISTANT FROM OUR LIVES. IT IS AS MUCH ABOUT TODAY AS IT IS THE PAST. I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO TAKE THE TIME TO READ THE LANGUAGE OF THIS RESOLUTION. THAT NOT ONLY DETAILS THE ORIGINS OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH BUT ALSO DISCUSSES CALIFORNIA'S BLACK HISTORY AND THE HISTORY THAT CONTINUES TO BE MADE. HONORING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HISTORICAL FIGURES OF BLACK WOMEN SUCH AS DR SHIRLEY WEBER WHO HAS BECOME OUR STATE'S FIRST BLACKS SERVING SECRETARY OF STATE. KAMALA HARRIS OF THE NATION'S FIRST BLACK WOMAN VICE PRESIDENT AND SO MANY MORE. AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S A LOT TO CELEBRATE. WHEN I LOOK OUT ON THIS FLOOR MEMBERS. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I DON'T SEE VERY MANY FACES THAT LOOK LIKE ME. THERE ARE ONLY THREE BLACK WOMEN IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. THREE OUT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE. THIS SOBERING TRUTH IS THAT BLACK WOMEN MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND SURVIVE DESPITE MULTIPLE NUMBER OF OBSTACLES IN OUR WAY. ENCOUNTERING BOTH RACISM AND SEXISM WE HAVE THE WORST WORST BIRTHING OUTCOMES DYING AT RATES UP TO FIVE TIMES MORE THAN OTHER FEMALE COUNTERPART. AND DESPITE A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN STUDIES CITING BLACK WOMEN ARE THE MOST EDUCATED AND BLACK AMERICANS. WE ARE STILL UNDER REPRESENTED AND HIGH RANKING AND HIGH WAGE POSITIONS INCLUDING POLITICAL OFFICE AND ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITY. SO LET TODAY AND THIS MONTH REMINDS YOU THAT WE AS INDIVIDUALS AND A STATE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ADVANCE SOUND POLICY AND TAKE ACTION TO BED TO DO BETTER FOR AND BY OUR BLACK CONSTITUENTS. I WANT TO CLOSE MY REMARKS BY QUOTING LINING BIRCH THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE. THERE IS NO MORE POWERFUL FORCE THAN A PEOPLE STEEPED IN OUR HISTORY. AND THERE IS NO HIGHER COSTS THAN HONORING OUR STRUGGLE AND ANCESTORS BY REMEMBERING. BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS A TIME TO CELEBRATE AND REMEMBER THE FULLNESS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE. AND THOUGH IT COULD NOT BE CONTAINED IN ONE MONTH ALONE I'M ENCOURAGED THAT THE HEALING OF THIS NATION AND THE STATE BEGINS THROUGH EDUCATING OURSELVES AND EACH OTHER.

I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CULVER CITY FOR RECOGNIZING MANY LEADERS IN PARTICULAR MR RUFFIN WHO IS SAID. ICON IN THE SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT SPECIFICALLY LEADING US IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I ONLY THINK ABOUT THE COALITION THAT IS REQUIRED OF THE INTERSECTION MALADY THAT EXISTS WE ALSO REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO RECOGNIZING THAT WITHIN THE LGBT COMMUNITY IT IS ACTUALLY THAT OF BLACK TRANS COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ARE MOST VICTIMIZED AND TARGETED. THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THAT IT TAKES INTENTIONALITY FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THEM. THE FIND WAYS OF PARTNERSHIP ALLY SHIP AND THE STRONGEST WAY NOT BY JUST EMPTY RHETORIC THE MEETING FULL VALUE CALIFORNIA AND WE THINK THAT THESE ISSUES ARE OF THE PAST. WHEN IN FACT WE KNOW EVEN AND JUST THIS WEEK AND OTHERSTATES. MEMBERS OF OUR BLACK COMMUNITY ARE TARGETED. ASSEMBLY COOLEY BLACK RANS. FAMILIES AS WELL AND OTHER STATES JUST THIS WEEK QUALIFYING GENDER AFFIRMING CARE AS CHILD ABUSE. AND SO WHAT WE THINK THAT THIS IS. A THING OF THE PAST.
