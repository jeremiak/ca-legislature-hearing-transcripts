TO CLOSE THE GENDER GAP THE PERSISTENCE STEM DEGREES AND CAREERS AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE OUR YOUNG WOMEN TO PURSUE REWARDING CAREERS OPPORTUNITIES IN STEM FIELDS.

SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR BY SENATOR KABBADI OTHER AN ACT RELATING TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CENTER CABALLERO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT S. B. TWENTY FOUR. WHICH MAKES THE REVISION TO THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER FORM TO PROTECT A CHILD'S SCHOOL MEDICAL AND DENTAL INFORMATION FROM IN A BROUGH SAID PARENT. THIS BILL REQUIRES THIRD PARTY INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS SCHOOLS DENTAL OFFICES FOR MEDICAL OFFICES TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS WHEN THEY RECEIVE A COPY OF SUCH A COURT RESTRAINING ORDER. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS RAVAGED OUR COMMUNITIES AT EVEN HIGHER RATES SINCE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC PARTICULARLY SINCE THE STAY AT HOME HOME ORDER WAS ISSUED LAST YEAR. FOR THOSE IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP THE pTHEIR PARTNERS ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS UP 275% OF ABUSED WOMEN WHO ARE MURDERED. ARE KILLED AFTER THEY LEAVE THEIR PARTNERS BILEN PERPETRATORS WHO MURDER THEIR EX PARTNERS GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO TRACK THE VICTIMS AND ONE STRATEGY IS TO TRACK THE LOCATION OF THE SHARED CHILDREN. THIS IS WHY OBTAINING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER IS VITAL TO SURVIVORS THE PROTECTIVE ORDERS REQUIRE THE PERPETRATOR TO REFRAIN FROM HAVING ANY CONTACT WITH THE VICTIMS AND THEIR CHILDREN. CURRENTLY A JUDGE CAN GRANT A NUMBER OF PROTECTIONS FOR THE ABUSED PARTY IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER INCLUDING ORDERS THAT PROTECT THE MEDICAL AND SCHOOL INFORMATION OF THE SHARE CHILDREN. HOWEVER WHILE THE GEORGE JUDGE HAS DISCRETION THE ACTUAL RESTRAINING ORDER FORM IT'S NOT CLEAR THEREFORE WHEN THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IT'S PRINTED AND GIVEN TO THE PARTIES IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY SLIGHT STATE SAY. BUT SCHOOL MEDICAL OR DENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SHARE CHILDREN SHOULD BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL FROM THE PERPETRATOR. THIS AMBIGUITY MAKES IT DIFFICULT LEGALLY FOR A SCHOOL- MEDICAL DENTAL I. TO ENTER. THERE THERE BY SB TWENTY FOUR CLARIFIES THIS BY EDITING THE CURRENT DOMESTIC RESTRAINING ORDER FORM TO OFFER BETTER PROTECTION FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEIR CHILDREN THANKFULLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR CABALLERO MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE HAS THREE TWENTY FOUR AND I WANT TO TAKE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SEND MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO KELLY'S FAMILY. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THEIR STORY AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THE PERCEPTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE OFTEN THINK THAT. IT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME WHEN A VICTIM IS IN THE RELATIONSHIP. BUT KELLY STORY PROVES THAT IS MORE DANGEROUS WHEN SOMEONE GETS THE COURAGE TO LEAVE. THEIR ABUSER. KELLY HAD THE COURAGE AND GOT OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH HER CHILDREN HER THREE BOYS AND HE TRACTOR DALAM. AND SHOT HER IN FRONT OF HER THREE BOYS. AND THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE OFTEN THINK OF PROTECTING THE VICTIM WHEN THEY'RE IN THE RELATIONSHIP AND THIS MEASURE IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT VICTIMS OUTSIDE THE RELATIONSHIP. AND SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE VALIDATE THAT COURAGE. IT TOOK TIME TO ANALYZE AND FINALLY DECIDE TO LEAVE. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO SAY AFTER THEY LEAVE WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER VICTIMS DESERVE BETTER AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING THEM MEMBERS THIS IS A CANDIDATE FOR UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT THEIR CAREER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

UNDER EXISTING LAW PHARMACISTS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE CERTAIN CLIA WAIVED TESTS. IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE CREE DEFICIENCY SB FOUR OH NINE PROVIDES A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION THROUGH STATUTORY CHANGES THAT FACILITATE THE AUTHORITY FOR PHARMACISTS TO PERFORM CLEAR WAVE KOVIN AN INFLUENZA TESTING IN A SAFE MANNER.

APRIL THIRTIETH NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE MARKS THE END OF ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING EPISODES IN AMERICAN HISTORY THE VIETNAM WAR- SOME OF US ARE OLD ENOUGH NAY RECALL THE SCENES OF APRIL THIRTIETH NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHERE MARINE HELICOPTERS WERE EVACUATING. CHILDREN FROM THE ROOF OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY. BLACK APRIL THE TIME OF MOURNING A TIME REMEMBRANCE NOT JUST THE LIVES LOST DURING THE WAR. BUT ALSO THE LIVES THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE IN THEIR HISTORIC STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH CONTINUES TODAY. THIS OBSERVANCE WILL SERVE AS A REMEMBRANCE OF THE TRAGIC LOSS IN ALSO A CELEBRATION OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE'S RESILIENCE AND STRENGTH TO PROSPER IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY. AND I'M MORE WAS A TRAGEDY AND IS A TRAGEDY NOT ONLY FOR THE VIETNAM. VIETNAMESE IN THE VIETNAM ERA VETERANS WHO ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE WAR IS ALSO ONE OF GREAT SUFFERING AND LOSS FOR THE VIETNAMESE CIVILIANS IN THE VIETNAMESE AMERICANS ACROSS THE SEA KNOWN AS BOAT PEOPLE TO FIND THIS LAND.

ACCORDINGTO THE TO THE UNITED STATES CENSUS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND VIETNAMESE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF VIETNAMESE FOUND OF COURSE AN ORANGE COUNTY ALSO IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT FORGET THIS TRAGEDY AND KNOWLEDGE THE CONCERNS OF THE VIETNAMESE AMERICANS. WHICH INCLUDE HUMAN RIGHTS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DEMOCRACY. AND PROTECTION AGAINST THREATS OF AGGRESSION. I BELIEVE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THESE SAME VALUES BE REMEMBERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DEDICATE OURSELVES TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND SOVEREIGNTY. FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONTINUE TO SUFFER IN VIETNAM. THIS RESOLUTION COMMEMORATES THE LIVES OF OUR SOLDIERS AS WELL THE NOSE FROM THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM. NONE OF THOSE WHO SACRIFICE THEIR USE FOR THE IDEALS OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY AND RECOGNIZE THE CIVILIANS WHO HAVE BEEN. RESILIENT LEE OVERCOMING THEIR WAR TRAUMAS BOTH HERE AND ABROAD. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAS PROSPERED IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY AND HAVE BROUGHT SO MUCH TO OUR CULTURE AND OUR ECONOMY. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT THE PEOPLE TO SAY TO CALIFORNIA SET ASIDE MOMENTS. TIME EVERY YEAR ON APRIL THIRTIETH TO REMEMBER THE SOLDIERS MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND CIVILIANS OF SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES. DURING THE VIETNAM WAR IN PURSUIT OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY. THE MONTH OF APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE SHALL BE PROCLAIMED AS A BLACK APRIL MEMORIAL MONTH AND WE HOPE.
