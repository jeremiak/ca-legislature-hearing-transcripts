00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:42.773
IT'S OF IT'S FAR MORE EFFECTIVE

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.476
IF WE TRY TO GET WEAPONS AT THE

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:46.277
VERY BEGINNING OF WHEN WE FIND

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:47.745
OUT SOMEONE IS PROHIBITED. THE

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:49.880

HUNDRED CASES FROM THE LIST SO

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:06.497

KEEP PACE THE COMMUNITY BUT

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.202
HERE'S THE REAL ISSUE THAT WE

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:11.802
HAVE THAT I WANTED TO MENTION

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.704
TO YOU. ARE WE HAVE FORTY KIDS

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:15.806

ARE BEING PAID SUBSTANTIALLY

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:24.882
LESS THAN- A SEAT P. OFFICER

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:28.352
FOR EXAMPLE IS PAY OUR AGES

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:28.986
WHEN THEY GET OPEN MORNING THEY

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:29.854

WEAPON FROM SOME PROHIBITED

THAT MEANS YOU'RE EITHER

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:35.292
FELONS. OR DANGEROUS THAT'S

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.694
WHAT THEY DO EVERY DAY AND

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.829
UNTIL THEY GO TO BED THAT'S

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:41.432

IN CONTEXT THOSE FORTY FIVE

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:53.077

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:53.811
SIZE OF THE STATE OF

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.475

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.281
WHERE. THE BOTTLENECK

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:47.416
ACCOUNTING BECAUSE AS YOU

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:48.984
MENTIONED. YEAH YOU JUST.

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:53.455
DIVIDE. SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:53.989
FIVE FORTY FIVE AND IT'S A

01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:55.224
FAIRLY. THE TICKET NUMBER LESS

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:56.992
ONE PERSON. THOUSAND GUNS STATE

01:09:57.059 --> 01:10:01.130
OF SO I MEAN- HOW HOW DO YOU.

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:04.033
HOW DO WE GET THIS PROBLEM AND

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:06.101
YET STILL BE ABLE TO SCALE YOUR

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:08.170
FORTY FIVE. OFFICERS IN THE

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.205
SAME TIME BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:11.840
LIKE YOU SAID THE SEVENTY

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:12.741
THOUSAND LOCAL OFFICERS THAT WE

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:14.476
HAVE. I THINK IF THE

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.912
LEGISLATURE THINKS OF APPS AS A

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:19.782
STATE WIDE PROGRAM. THAT

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:21.550
INVOLVES EVERYONE IN LAW

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:24.086
ENFORCEMENT. AS EVERYONE ON LAW

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:25.354
ENFORCEMENT KNOWS THAT THEY

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:28.624
HAVE A DUTY TO HELP RECOVER A

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:29.792
WEB. THEY'LL GET SOME RIGHT TO

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.160
THE DONE. THEN WHAT WE DO IS

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:33.395
TRY TO FIGURE TO COURTNEY

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:34.163
INNOCENT BY WAS NOT JUST LAW

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:35.764
ENFORCEMENT IF THE COURTS AS

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.666
WELL BECAUSE THE COURTS TO THE

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:38.601
ONE THAT ULTIMATELY CALLOUS

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:40.669
DISPERSED LONGER HAS. THE RIGHT

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:41.837
TO. AND SO WE- WERE NATIVE

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.238
BECAUSE IT IS FAR EASIER AS I

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:45.207
SAID EARLIER. TO RETRIEVE A

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:47.076
WEAPON. BEFORE THE PERSON GETS

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:49.311
LOOSE. AND ROAMS THE STATE.

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.981
THEN AFTERWARDS- THE BEST JOB

01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:53.782
WE CAN DO IS AT. THE MOMENT THE

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:55.751
PERSON BECOMES. A NAME ON THE

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:58.220
APPS SYSTEM WE GET THE BEFORE

01:10:58.287 --> 01:10:59.955
THEY GET LOOSE. SO IT'S MORE

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:01.991
MATTER COORDINATION THAT'S WHY

01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:02.591
THINK WE ARE ENTERING A NEW.

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:05.060
STAGE WITHIN THE APPS PROGRAM.

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:09.798
I THINK FUN. AS MY COLLEAGUE

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:13.035
EARLIER MENTIONED. IN THE PAST.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.638
POINT EN EN. APPROPRIATE THE

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:18.307
RESOURCES THAT WAS REQUESTED

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:22.144
AND IT WASN'T IT WASN'T WE NEED

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:23.579
TWENTY FOUR MILLION AND X. Y.

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.748
Z. WHICH IS WE NEED FOR MILLION

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.416
WE KIND OF ASSUME THAT WE WOULD

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:30.085
SEE- SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:33.088
ON THE BACKLOG I THINK THERE'S-

01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:35.224
I THINK FRUSTRATION FROM THIS

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.359
LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT WE'VE

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:41.530
DONE WE'VE DONE OUR PART. PORT

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:44.667
FOR DOESN'T. LIKE IT'S THE AS

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.402
MUCH PROGRESS AS WE HAD HOPED

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:49.171
AND SO I THINK THAT- I THINK

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:49.772
GOING TO STAND THERE NEEDS TO

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:54.610
BE. BETTER COORDINATION BUT

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:56.845
HERO I ITEM I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:59.815
MONEY BY ITSELF SOLVE THE

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:00.849
COORDINATION ISSUE THAT WE'RE

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.317
TALKING ABOUT ME YOU KNOW WE

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:03.519
CAN APPROPRIATE MONEY I CAN'T

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:04.586
FORCE PEOPLE TO PICK UP THE

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:07.489
PHONE OR GET A ROOM OR TO

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:10.993
DESIGN A PLAN- AND SORT OF.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.594
WORKING ON THIS SEEMS LIKE YOU

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:13.662

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.831
OF URGENCY THERE THERE IS NO. I

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:17.166
DON'T THIS IS A SINGLE PERSON

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WERE

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.900
GIVEN. THAT THERE SEEM TO BE A

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:40.002
REDUCTION IN THE EFFICIENCY OF

AGAIN THIS WHICH I SORT OF

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:53.081
INHERITED THIS AGAIN- THIS IS

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:55.550
THAT WE'VE A MORE LONG TERM

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:57.486

ENFORCE OUR GAMING LAWS IN THE

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:16.238
STATE. AND I THINK THE

STAKEHOLDERS KNOW THAT. I CAME

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:22.044

THEM. AND QUITE HONESTLY I'M

01:18:58.266 --> 01:18:59.301
LIMITED BY THE EXISTING

BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:16.585
AUDITOR'S. FINDINGS I THINK

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:17.152
THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERNING

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:19.888
PART IS BECAUSE- ON IT FROM A

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:20.722
FROM A BUDGET COMMITTEE

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:24.159
STANDPOINT. IF WERE GIVING MORE

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.894
MONEY AND WE'RE SEEING LESS

01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:27.996
EFFICIENCY. ARE SORT OF RAISES

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:30.065
A RED FLAG SOMEONE IF YOU COULD

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:30.899
JUST SPECIFICALLY COMMENT ON

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:32.968
THAT ONE CHICKEN FRIED YEAH AND

01:19:33.034 --> 01:19:34.102
THAT I'M NOT I CAN. TO HAVE

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:35.704
THINGS WE HAD BEEN SENT TO THE

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.406
PAST. LAST YEAR I MENTION THE

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:38.974
NUMBERS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:39.608
WERE HERE WHEN I MENTIONED

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:41.710
NUMBERS BUT- WE HAD. AT THE

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:45.580
TIME THE AUDIT THERE WERE. WHEN

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:47.082
THE- AND TWENTY NINE CASES THAT

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:48.383
WERE BACK. THAT WERE WAITING

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.218
FOR LICENSE. AND HAD NOT BEEN

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:52.754
PROCESSED- THAT WAS A YEAR AGO.

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:56.158
TODAY THAT NUMBER IS NOW DOWN

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:57.792
TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE. SO

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.194
WE CLEARED ALMOST ALL THAT BACK.

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.196
AND WE'RE DOING IT WITH THE AND

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:02.664
MY SUPERVISORS HAVING TO DO THE

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:05.267
WORK OF SOMEONE IS FOR THREE TO

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.368
FOUR CLASSIFICATIONS BELOW THEM

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:08.170
BECAUSE I'VE TOLD THEM YOU

01:20:08.236 --> 01:20:09.504
DON'T USE ANALYST TO DO THAT

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.339
YOU USE ALICE TO START DOING

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:13.942
THE- THAT DOES IT FOR THE-

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.744
PROBLEM. A AND WHAT WE'RE

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:16.378
REQUESTING A MONEY IS A THAT WE

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:18.180
CAN FINALLY PUT MONEY INTO THE

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:20.515
AREAS WHERE WE NEED IT AND MIKE

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:22.984
MIKE MY COMMITMENT TO YOU IS IF

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:24.619

AND I HOPE. AGAIN AS WE DID.

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:31.626
YOUR SECOND SHOW YOU RESULTS

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:35.197
THE- OTHER ONE QUESTIONS MAKS.

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:37.465
COMPLETE SENSE TO ME THAT. THE

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:41.937
ENFORCEMENT. ARM OF THESE LAWS

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:44.339
IS IN YOUR AGENCY I WAS

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:46.074
WONDERING IF YOU HAD A SENSE OF

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:48.009
THE LICENSING PART OF IT

01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:48.643
BECAUSE LICENSING TRADITIONALLY

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:52.747
WOULD BE SAY IN DCA WHEREAS YOU

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:53.782
KNOW JUST LIKE WE HAVE WITH

01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:55.550
CANNABIS RIGHT THE ENFORCEMENT

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:58.720
PART IS IN YOUR AGENCY IT'S NOT

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:00.722
THAT'S NOT DCA BOTH ENFORCEMENT

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.724
BY SOMETHING. ARM WHICH WE YOUR

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:05.126
A HAS BOTH BEEN TAKEN AND IF

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:06.027
YOU HAVE THOUGHT TO WHAT THAT

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:08.296
THAT SHOULD BE SEPARATE OR

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:13.235
REMAIN TOGETHER- IT IT SEEMS

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:14.236
THE ONE AREA. WHERE HI YOU HAVE

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:16.771
BOTH. AND I JUST GIVE YOU

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:17.973
ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE'D TOTALLY

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:20.442
NON NON SEQUITUR BUT WE HAVE A

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:21.509
RECYCLING PROGRAM WHICH IS KIND

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:22.877
OF FAILING BECAUSE WE HAVE AN

01:21:22.944 --> 01:21:24.946
AGENCY THAT DOES THE PROGRAM

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:26.514
BUT ALSO WAS IN CHARGE OF

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:27.582
ENFORCING THEN IN THAT OTHER

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:29.417
AGENCY WE ARE TAKING A HARD

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:30.919
LOOK WHAT AT THAT CONTINUES TO

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:33.722
MAKE SENSE. YET WE CAN. POINT

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:35.357
OUT A COUPLE OF OTHER. AND THAT

01:21:35.423 --> 01:21:38.026
THE AREA OF. PROFESSIONAL

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:39.060
MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL LICENSING

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:40.328
THERE'S SOME ISSUES AND THERE'S

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:41.963
A MODEL THAT HE HASN'T TOTALLY

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:45.400
WORK- WHERE WE ARE INVOLVED

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:46.735
BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONES TO

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:47.469
PROSECUTE THE CASES ACT BUT

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:49.104
ANOTHER AGENCY ACTUALLY%

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:50.705
INVESTIGATIVE WORK AND TOO

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:51.706
OFTEN WE'RE FINDING THAT THE

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:53.408
SKIT WORK IS INCOMPLETE. AND WE

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.143
HAVE TO ASK NICKEL BACK BEFORE

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:57.245
WORK BETTER PROSECUTED CASE SO

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:59.147
AT THERE'S A VALUE IN HAVING

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:00.849
SOMEONE WHO COULD CONNECT ALL

01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:02.550
THOSE. AND BY YOUR SITE AND THE

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:04.886
ENFORCEMENT CASE AND THIS IS A-

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.588
THIS IS A SENSITIVE AREA-

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:09.858
GAMBLING HAS TRACTORS AND A BAD

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.593
SUPPORTERS AND I MEET AT-

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.595
DETRACTORS AND WHAT I CAN TELL

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:15.630
YOU IS THAT I THINK IF SO LONG

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:18.767
AS- I CAN GET THE SHOP IN PLACE

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:20.568
WE HAVE THE PERSONNEL THAT WE

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:21.803
NEED. AND THAT YOU WILL. WITH

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.506
THE READ THIS. THAT AS LONG AS

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:26.875
I HAVE THIS WORK OUT WE WILL DO

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:29.344
RIGHT FROM A DIZZY AND WE WILL

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:30.779
PERFORM AND WE WILL SHOW YOU

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.280
THE NUMBERS AND HOPEFULLY

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:33.581
YOU'LL SEE THAT WE PERFORM IF

01:22:33.648 --> 01:22:35.250
WE DON'T THEN CERTAINLY I THINK

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:36.718
YOU SHOULD. CONSIDER SOMETHING

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:37.686
ELSE BUT I WOULD HOPE YOU GIVE

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.321
US A CHANCE TO SHOW THAT WE CAN

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:41.089
PERFORM. OKAY BUT I'M SAYING

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:43.892
YOU MY FIRST YEAR I THINK IS

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:47.929
BUDGET CHAIR- WE GAVE THIRTY

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:48.863
TWO POSITIONS IT'S JUST PER THE

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.799
AUDITOR'S FINDINGS IN THE

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:51.433
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FISCAL YEAR SO

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.868
THIS IS NOT AGAIN THE FIRST

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:56.404
TIME THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:56.971
AGENCIES COMES AHEAD IT WAS

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:58.206
POSITIONS. THE MESSAGE WHICH

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:00.742
DAPSONE. IT A WEEK I DON'T

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:04.112
THINK WE PICKED. THE THIRTY TWO

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:04.879
POSITION THAT THE THAT THE

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.381
REQUEST OF THE- DEPARTMENT

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:07.916
LEAVE WITH A FEEL THAT REQUEST

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.317
I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:11.453
ENTHUSIASM KNOWING. THE BACKLOG

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:13.822
KNOWING- AGAIN THE WORK THAT

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:15.824
NEEDED TO BE THERE BUT THEN

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:17.092
AGAIN WHEN THE AUDITOR. FINDS A

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:19.060
LACK OF EFFICIENCY REGARDING A

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:20.395
PARTICULAR THOSE POSITIONS I

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:22.664
THINK THERE'S SOME CONCERN HAVE

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:24.366
FOR FUTURE POSITIONS IT IT IF I

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.167
HAD BEEN YOUR TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:27.168
TWENTY SIXTEEN. I'D BE RISK

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:28.870
ENDING AS BEST I COULD. NOT

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.739

THE DEPARTMENT ARE OUR WORK. BY

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:45.220
WHAT WE'RE SAYING WE CAN DO I

OTHER THINGS THAT RESULT IN

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:49.109

REGULATIONS PROCESS FOLLOW THE

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.935
SPIRIT OF THE LAW. WE URGE IF

THE DATABASE IS NOT MERELY SHUT

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:40.273

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.009
IT SHOULD BE TWO YEARS AND NOT

GETTING INVOLVED IS INVOLVED.

01:44:46.546 --> 01:44:48.315
IS BETWEEN ONE AND TWO YEARS.

01:44:48.382 --> 01:44:49.616
THAT YOU HAVE TO REQUIRE

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:51.518
PROBABLE CAUSE FOR A STOP. NOT

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:53.153
REASONABLE SUSPICION WHICH IS

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.621
TOO WEAK OF A STANDARD. THAT WE

01:44:54.688 --> 01:44:56.123
HAVE TO THAT THE DATABASE

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:57.591
CONTINUES TO BE VAGUE AN OVERLY

01:44:57.658 --> 01:44:59.493
BROAD IN TERMS OF CRITERIA.

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:01.762
THAT ASSOCIATION- SCENE AND A

01:45:01.828 --> 01:45:05.265
GANG- ADDRESS OR LOCATION. AND

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:07.234

SPECIFIC GANG IS TO BROUGHT. ON

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:13.006
THAT YOU HAVE TO ELIMINATE

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:15.208
GANG. HITS AS A CLASSIFICATION.

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:17.711
OF OVERLY BROAD AND BRINGS A

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:18.645
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE- ARE NOT

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:20.981
GETTING INVOLVED. I'M SELF

01:45:21.048 --> 01:45:22.282
ADMISSION IS SO OFTEN

01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:23.684
INCRIMINATING AND RIDICULOUS

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:25.152
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE TO BE

01:45:25.218 --> 01:45:27.020
THE MOST LOGICAL THING TO GO BY

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:28.722
BUT SO OFTEN PEOPLE ARE EITHER

01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:30.223
TRYING TO CREATE A REPUTATION

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:32.426
OR COURSE IN THE SAME THING SO

01:45:32.492 --> 01:45:33.927
I WOULD REQUIRE. ON THAT THAT

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:35.128
RIGHT TO BE LOOKED AT MORE

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:37.330
CLOSELY. ON THREE BEING

MAY OR MAY NOT BE FOR THE

01:45:42.969 --> 01:45:44.571
BENEFIT OF THE GANG BECAUSE-

01:45:44.638 --> 01:45:45.372
THE STEP BACK HAS SO MANY

01:45:45.439 --> 01:45:47.240
OFFENSES THAT. PRETTY MUCH

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:49.009
COVERS THE NOT NOT GOING TO SAY

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:50.110
COVERS THE WHOLE PENAL CODE BUT

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:51.945
IT'S A VERY EXTENSIVE LIST. SO

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:53.613
SHOULD COME WITH AN OFFICIAL

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:55.215

CHANCE TO TALK I APPRECIATE

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:01.722
THAT. THE LAST THING I WOULD

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:02.889
JUST SAY THAT THERE IS A

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:03.490

POSITIONS HELPFUL FOR THOSE.

02:08:50.055 --> 02:08:53.992
ONE FINAL. YEAH I NEED ONLY

OFFICE WE HAVE COME ON BCP'S

02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:56.895
WILL START WITH THE LICENSING

02:08:56.962 --> 02:08:59.031
ONE- ON THE LICENSING ONE WE

02:08:59.098 --> 02:09:00.699
ARE RECOMMENDING- REJECTING THE

02:09:00.766 --> 02:09:02.601
PROPOSAL FOR BEING PREMATURE

02:09:02.668 --> 02:09:04.870
FOR TWO REASONS- THE FIRST

02:09:04.937 --> 02:09:07.706
THREE IN IS A CONCERN THAT IS

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:09.708
SHARED BY THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:11.710
IN TERMS OF A NUMBER CONCEIT

02:09:11.777 --> 02:09:14.113
AND PROCEDURAL JAZZ IN SAID

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:15.147
HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENT QUITE

02:09:15.214 --> 02:09:17.449
RECENTLY AND SO THE FULL IMPACT

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:18.684
OF THOSE CHANGES ARE UNKNOWN.

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:20.185
AND FOR THE LETTER TO DETERMINE

02:09:20.252 --> 02:09:22.321
THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL ONGOING

02:09:22.387 --> 02:09:23.589
RESOURCES THE FULL IMPACT

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:25.457
REALLY SHOULD BE MEASURED AND

02:09:25.524 --> 02:09:27.693
CAPTURED THE SECOND IS RELATED

02:09:27.759 --> 02:09:29.495
TO THAT IS THAT THESE REQUESTS

02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:32.097
FOR NOT ANALYST POSITION INS

02:09:32.164 --> 02:09:34.800
SHOULD WE BE CONSIDERED CONCUR

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:39.071
ME THE- FOR PERMANENT ANIL.

02:09:39.138 --> 02:09:41.707
JULY COMING DE BECAUSE- FOR THE

02:09:41.773 --> 02:09:42.508
EXPIRE. AND THE REASON FOR THE

02:09:42.574 --> 02:09:44.076
IS SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

02:09:44.143 --> 02:09:46.211
TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT

02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:47.980
ARE PROPOSED TO BE SHIFTING

02:09:48.046 --> 02:09:49.281
INTO THESE NON ANALYST

02:09:49.348 --> 02:09:50.749
POSITIONS WOULD OTHERWISE BE

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:52.684
DONE BY THE ANALYSTS. AND SO

02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:54.219
THEY REALLY SHOULD BE TAKEN AND

02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:55.554
HOLE IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT

02:09:55.621 --> 02:09:57.055
THE TOTAL LEVEL OF RESOURCES.

02:09:57.122 --> 02:09:58.323
AND THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF

02:09:58.390 --> 02:10:00.559
STAFF THAT ARE NEEDED ON AN

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:02.528
ONGOING BASIS. FOR THE

02:10:02.594 --> 02:10:04.129
OVERSIGHT PCP WE ARE

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:05.631
RECOMMENDING MODIFYING THAT

02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:08.734
PROPOSAL- BY NOT APPROVING

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.068
THREE OF THE THIRTY POSITIONS

02:10:10.135 --> 02:10:11.236
THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THAT BCP

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:13.038
WE GENERALLY DON'T HAVE A UP-

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:14.406
AN ISSUE WITH THE PROACTIVE

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:16.008
APPROACH. RELATED TO THE

02:10:16.074 --> 02:10:16.909
SPECIAL AGENTS IN THE GAME IN

02:10:16.975 --> 02:10:19.178
EXETER. THE THREE POSITIONS IN

02:10:19.244 --> 02:10:20.479
QUESTION ARE RELATED TO THE IN

02:10:20.546 --> 02:10:22.781
HOUSE LEGAL RESOURCES- AND SO

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:24.082
THESE WOULD BE POSITIONS THAT

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:25.117
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A VARIETY

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:26.518
OF ACTIVITIES INCLUDING

02:10:26.585 --> 02:10:28.787

AND WE HAVE THIS RECOMMENDATION

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:35.627
BECAUSE WE GENERALLY FIND OTHER

02:10:35.694 --> 02:10:37.296
ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF DEALING

02:10:37.362 --> 02:10:39.565
WITH THAT WORKLOAD FOR EXAMPLE.

02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:42.201
INCREASED TRAINING FOR IT LESS

02:10:42.267 --> 02:10:43.602
THAN THEIR SUPERVISORS COULD BE

02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:47.005
USED TO ENSURE THAT LETTERS

02:10:47.072 --> 02:10:47.606
ISSUED IN BOTH AN APPROPRIATE

02:10:47.673 --> 02:10:48.874

WAY. CAN YOU COME IN I'M SURE I

02:10:53.145 --> 02:10:54.079
DIDN'T ADDRESS I ONLY JUST ONE

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:56.548
OF THE BC PIECE OF A MAKES BIG

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:57.149
BRIEFLY TO THE LICENSING

02:10:57.216 --> 02:10:59.785

COMING BEFORE YOU NEXT YEAR

02:11:02.087 --> 02:11:03.789
WITH THE B. C. P. FOR PERMANENT

02:11:03.855 --> 02:11:05.691
FUNDING FOR THOSE THIRTY TWO OR

02:11:05.757 --> 02:11:07.726
SOME. NUMBER OF THOSE THIRTY

02:11:07.793 --> 02:11:08.994
TWO POSITIONS SO JUST TO BE

02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:11.196
CLEAR THAT THIS. IS COMPLETELY

02:11:11.263 --> 02:11:12.931
SEPARATE FROM THAT ONE. AND WE

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:14.233
ARE LOOKING FOR THINGS THERE

02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:15.000
ARE THINGS THAT THE AUDITOR'S

02:11:15.067 --> 02:11:17.102
SUGGEST. THAT THE NEW DUTIES

02:11:17.169 --> 02:11:18.503
THAT THE INTAKE UNIT HOUSE CHIU

02:11:18.570 --> 02:11:21.240
DOING LETTERS. DOING IMOGENE

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:21.807
AND PUTTING THINGS IN THE

02:11:21.873 --> 02:11:23.108
DATABASE SO WE THINK THERE'S

02:11:23.175 --> 02:11:25.043
ALREADY CURRENTLY WORK LOW. WHO

02:11:25.110 --> 02:11:26.745
WOULD ALSO KNOW THAT WE WOULD

02:11:26.812 --> 02:11:27.946
LIKE TO SHIFT MORE NON

02:11:28.013 --> 02:11:30.616
ANALYST'S DUTIES TO THAT UNIT-

02:11:30.682 --> 02:11:31.817
TO THE CAN BE ABLE TO HANDLE

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:34.386
IT. WE DON'T WANT THE ANALYST-

02:11:34.453 --> 02:11:36.388
BE. THE ONE THE CONSTRAINED.

02:11:36.455 --> 02:11:37.222
INVESTIGATIONS OF THERE ARE

02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:40.459
THINGS THAT OTHER OF LOWER.

02:11:40.525 --> 02:11:42.261
CLERICAL SUPPORT LEVEL TYPE OF

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:43.528
POSITIONS CAN DO WE THINK

02:11:43.595 --> 02:11:44.463
THAT'S AN EFFICIENT USE OF

02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:46.598
RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:47.432
ANALYSTS ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE

02:11:47.499 --> 02:11:49.635
SUPPOSED TO DO ALSO IN THE

02:11:49.701 --> 02:11:51.837
LICENSING SECTION- THERE IS NO

02:11:51.903 --> 02:11:53.639
SUPPORT STAFF SEWER ASKING FOR

02:11:53.705 --> 02:11:54.973
A COUPLE OF OFFICE TECHNICIANS

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:57.242
FOR THOSE TWO UNITS. SO THAT WE

02:11:57.309 --> 02:11:58.277
DON'T HAVE EITHER ANALYSTS OR

02:11:58.343 --> 02:11:59.945
MANAGERS HAVING TO HAVE SENT

02:12:00.012 --> 02:12:01.647
OUT LETTERS AND DOING COPYING

02:12:01.713 --> 02:12:03.148
THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET

02:12:03.215 --> 02:12:04.549
THE BALL ROLLING TO MAKE SURE

02:12:04.616 --> 02:12:05.417
THE AND LET'S GET THE WORK DONE

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:07.052
AND THE MANAGERS ARE ABLE TO

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:08.687
REVIEW IT AND GET IT DONE SO WE

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:10.389
HAD IDENTIFIED THINGS THAT WE

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:11.256
THINK WILL MAKE US MORE.

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:14.026
EFFICIENT IN A SURE THAT- WE

02:12:14.092 --> 02:12:15.160
ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG AND ALSO

02:12:15.227 --> 02:12:17.496
THAT WE DON'T BACKSLIDE INTO

02:12:17.562 --> 02:12:20.866
DOESN'T COME BACK. THE QUESTION.

02:12:20.932 --> 02:12:23.635
YEAH OKAY. THANKS VENTURA I

02:12:23.702 --> 02:12:25.537
JUST OPENED IT JUST ASK THE

02:12:25.604 --> 02:12:29.741
AUDITOR TO ADDRESS THE- ITEM IN

02:12:29.808 --> 02:12:31.510
THE AGENDA THAT TALKED ABOUT.

02:12:31.576 --> 02:12:32.778
AND THE TEAM'S FINDINGS

02:12:32.844 --> 02:12:35.814
REGARDING P. EFFICIENCY OF THE

02:12:35.881 --> 02:12:39.151
ORGANIZATION- OBVIOUSLY THE

02:12:39.217 --> 02:12:40.919
QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE

02:12:40.986 --> 02:12:44.690
IS. SINCE THE DEPARTMENT HAS

02:12:44.756 --> 02:12:48.360
SHOWN- INEFFICIENCY WITH THE

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:51.363
APPROPRIATION WE DID AND

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.897
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IT DOESN'T

02:12:51.963 --> 02:12:53.365
REALLY MAKE SENSE TO DO FURTHER

02:12:53.432 --> 02:12:56.001
APPROPRIATION NOT US IF LA HAS

02:12:56.068 --> 02:12:59.271
A COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL. SO

02:12:59.338 --> 02:13:01.740
IN TERMS OF OUR FINDING- AS I

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:03.675
SUMMARIZED- THIS IS THE

02:13:03.742 --> 02:13:04.776
STATISTICS SHOW THAT THOSE

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:06.745
POSITIONS HAD MARKEDLY

02:13:06.812 --> 02:13:08.547
DECREASING IN IMPACT ON ON THE

02:13:08.613 --> 02:13:10.048
CASELOAD AT THE BILL WHICH

02:13:10.115 --> 02:13:11.383
RAISE CONCERNS FOR US BECAUSE

02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:12.851
THEY WERE REQUESTED. UNDER THE

02:13:12.918 --> 02:13:15.420
AUSPICES OF CLEARING THAT

02:13:15.487 --> 02:13:18.890
BACKLOG. EQUALLY CONCERNING TO

02:13:18.957 --> 02:13:20.058
US IS YOU WOULD READ IN OUR

02:13:20.125 --> 02:13:21.827
REPORT IS THAT. ON THE PIER

02:13:21.893 --> 02:13:23.829
WASN'T REALLY ABLE TO PROVIDE A

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:25.163
CONVINCING OCCUR HERE AT REASON

02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:27.332
AS TO WHY THAT DECREASE IN

02:13:27.399 --> 02:13:27.933
PRODUCTIVITY OR EFFICIENCY WAS

02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:30.268
OCCURRING- THERE ARE REFERENCES

02:13:30.335 --> 02:13:30.902
TO DIFFERENT POOLS OF

02:13:30.969 --> 02:13:32.404
APPLICANTS TAKING A DIFFERENT

02:13:32.471 --> 02:13:34.406
AMOUNT OF TIME- HOWEVER WHEN

02:13:34.473 --> 02:13:36.208
YOU LOOK AT THE CASE LOAD AND

02:13:36.274 --> 02:13:37.376
THE DISTRIBUTION OF IT THAT.

02:13:37.442 --> 02:13:39.711
WASN'T REALLY. LINKS CLEARLY TO

02:13:39.778 --> 02:13:40.545
THE PROBLEMS THAT WE WERE

02:13:40.612 --> 02:13:42.581
SEEING I'M SO THEY DID SEEM TO

02:13:42.647 --> 02:13:44.449
THE PROBLEMS DID SEEM TO BE

02:13:44.516 --> 02:13:46.618
INSOFAR AS WE CAN DIAGNOSE THEM

02:13:46.685 --> 02:13:47.919
TO BE PROCEDURAL IN TERMS OF.

02:13:47.986 --> 02:13:49.321
ANALYZING THE COMPLETENESS OF

02:13:49.388 --> 02:13:50.389
APPLICATIONS AS THEY COME IN

02:13:50.455 --> 02:13:51.590
THE DOOR AS OPPOSED TO WAITING

02:13:51.656 --> 02:13:55.293
FOR ANALYSTS TO DO IT LATER. ON

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:55.861
SOME OF THE OTHER. CLERICAL

02:13:55.927 --> 02:13:56.762
QUOTE UNQUOTE TYPE ACTIVITIES

02:13:56.828 --> 02:13:58.196
THAT THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:13:58.263 --> 02:13:59.865
IS REFERRING TO NOW. AGAIN I

OF THIRTY TWO POSITIONS. I

02:14:38.003 --> 02:14:40.806

ARE WARRANT ON AN ONGOING DUE

HOWEVER WE DON'T. GET TO OF.

02:15:28.453 --> 02:15:35.594

IN YOUR AUDIT OF THE OF THE

02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:39.231
BEER TO JEFF ANY. THOUGHTS

02:15:39.297 --> 02:15:40.198
ABOUT THE QUESTION I RAISED

02:15:40.265 --> 02:15:41.199
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

02:15:41.266 --> 02:15:42.467
WHETHER WHETHER REALLY MADE

02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:44.369
SENSE. TO HAVE BOTH.

02:15:44.436 --> 02:15:46.538
ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS

02:15:46.605 --> 02:15:47.706
LICENSING FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE

02:15:47.772 --> 02:15:49.875
DEPARTMENT WHETHER THE DUTCH

02:15:49.941 --> 02:15:51.142
REALLY BE SEPARATE. NO THAT WAS

02:15:51.209 --> 02:15:52.043
NOTHING THAT WE LOOK AT

02:15:52.110 --> 02:15:53.745
SPECIFICALLY AND IN FACT THAT.

02:15:53.812 --> 02:15:55.747
ARE THE MAJORITY OF OUR OF OUR

02:15:55.814 --> 02:15:57.415
FINDINGS OUR FOCUS WAS IN FACT

02:15:57.482 --> 02:15:59.017
ON ON THE LICENSING SIDE WHICH

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:00.886
HAS- AS I SAID NGUYEN IT'S MY

02:16:00.952 --> 02:16:02.320
PLACE TO SPEAK TO THE REQUEST

02:16:02.387 --> 02:16:04.289
FOR THE ENFORCEMENT POSITIONS.

02:16:04.356 --> 02:16:05.423
CANNELLA JIM DID YOUR THOUGHTS

02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:07.792
ABOUT THE- THOUGHT OF FINDINGS-

02:16:07.859 --> 02:16:10.896
IN TERMS OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS-

02:16:10.962 --> 02:16:13.932
WE- THIS ISSUE HAS POPPED UP

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:15.400
NUMEROUS YEARS THROUGH

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:16.401
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE EXCITER

02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:17.836
AND IT'S BEEN A PERSISTENT

02:16:17.903 --> 02:16:19.738
PROBLEM. AND SO THE ISSUES OF

02:16:19.804 --> 02:16:21.206
THE DECLINING PRODUCTIVITY WERE

02:16:21.273 --> 02:16:22.941
CERTAINLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:23.575
THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

02:16:23.642 --> 02:16:24.643
WHY WE'RE MAKING THIS

02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:26.478
RECOMMENDATION IN TERMS OF-

02:16:26.545 --> 02:16:27.512
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE

02:16:27.579 --> 02:16:29.281
LICENSING BECAUSE IT- NON

02:16:29.347 --> 02:16:30.549
ANALYTICAL POSITIONS. IN

02:16:30.615 --> 02:16:32.117
PARTICULAR YOU WANT TO LOOK AT

02:16:32.183 --> 02:16:34.386
THE PROCESS AND HOLE. AND

02:16:34.452 --> 02:16:35.353
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE

02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:37.455
LEVEL OF RESOURCES ARE NEEDED

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:39.324
AND SOME OF THAT INVOLVES

02:16:39.391 --> 02:16:41.126
THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED

02:16:41.192 --> 02:16:43.295
ON EACH PARTICULAR APPLICATION.

02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:44.062
SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU'RE

02:16:44.129 --> 02:16:46.231
BACKLOG IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT

02:16:46.298 --> 02:16:46.765
YOU MIGHT BE DOING CERTAIN

02:16:46.831 --> 02:16:48.099
THINGS TO GET IT DONE AND GET

02:16:48.166 --> 02:16:49.034
IT OUT OF THE WAY. BUT THEN

02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:50.535
MOVING FORWARD ON AN ONGOING

02:16:50.602 --> 02:16:51.770
BASIS THE PROCESS MIGHT LOOK

02:16:51.836 --> 02:16:54.172
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND REQUIRE.

02:16:54.239 --> 02:16:55.473
A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF RESOURCES

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.408
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:16:56.474 --> 02:16:58.877
REASONS WHY WE'RE RECOMMENDING-

02:16:58.944 --> 02:17:00.579
CONSIDERING IT IN HORRIBLE AT

02:17:00.645 --> 02:17:01.947
PART OF NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET

02:17:02.013 --> 02:17:04.583
LIKELY BUDGET REQUEST. THANK

02:17:04.649 --> 02:17:06.952

02:17:07.018 --> 02:17:08.353

02:17:10.088 --> 02:17:11.122
OF HAVING THE ENFORCEMENT A

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:12.490
LICENSING TOGETHER I JUST WANT

02:17:12.557 --> 02:17:15.527
TO REITERATE KIND OF WHAT THE-

02:17:15.594 --> 02:17:18.797
CAN MOTIVATE MOTIVATED US WITH

02:17:18.863 --> 02:17:19.331
ONE OF THOSE BCP'S IS THE

02:17:19.397 --> 02:17:19.831
INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR

02:17:19.898 --> 02:17:21.366
ENFORCEMENT OUR INVESTIGATIVE

02:17:21.433 --> 02:17:22.567
AUDITOR'S IN THE LICENSING

02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:25.937
SECTION BECAUSE THEY DO RELY ON

02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:27.472
ONE ANOTHER IN THEY WORK

02:17:27.539 --> 02:17:30.342
COLLECTIVELY TO THAT. MAKE SURE

02:17:30.408 --> 02:17:31.676
THE PEOPLE ARE. GET ON THE

02:17:31.743 --> 02:17:32.844
RIGHT TRACK AND WE DON'T HAVE

02:17:32.911 --> 02:17:34.279
TO TAKE DISCIPLINARY ATION

02:17:34.346 --> 02:17:35.680
AGAINST THEM SO THAT IS

02:17:35.747 --> 02:17:36.781
SOMETHING THAT I DO I DO WANT

02:17:36.848 --> 02:17:37.983
TO POINT OUT BECAUSE I THINK

02:17:38.049 --> 02:17:38.950
THAT SOME FOLKS THINK WE'RE

02:17:39.017 --> 02:17:41.086
KIND OF SILO TO- AND WHILE THEY

02:17:41.152 --> 02:17:41.853
DO HAVE DIFFERENT

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:43.154
RESPONSIBILITIES THEY DO HAVE

02:17:43.221 --> 02:17:44.389
TO WORK TOGETHER SO IT THINK

02:17:44.456 --> 02:17:46.024
THAT IS ONE THING. IT'S

02:17:46.091 --> 02:17:47.993
IMPORTANT TO HAVE ALL OF THOSE

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:50.095
RESOURCES AND ONE PLACE-

02:17:50.161 --> 02:17:51.229
ESPECIALLY FOR MELINDA

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:53.098
MISTREATED ISSUES TO THEY KIND

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:54.199
OF OVERLAP AND WORK HAND IN

02:17:54.265 --> 02:17:55.667
HAND TOGETHER. YEAH AND I DON'T

02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:57.168
KNOW IF YOU HAVE A- COMMENT I

02:17:57.235 --> 02:17:58.303
THINK IF YOU IF YOU TALK TO

02:17:58.370 --> 02:18:00.538
SOME OF THE- PUMP ESTABLISHMENT

02:18:00.605 --> 02:18:02.273
TO COME IN FOR LICENSING. THEIR

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:05.343
THEIR FEEDBACK TO- TO US HAS

02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:07.178
BEEN THAT THEY FEEL LIKE

02:18:07.245 --> 02:18:08.246
THEY'RE THEY'RE SORT OF.

02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:10.081
TREATED LIKE CRIMINALS. THAT

02:18:10.148 --> 02:18:13.218
THEY- ARE ARE TREATED- AS IF

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:16.421
THEIR- THEIR INNOCENCE THROUGH

02:18:16.488 --> 02:18:18.857
THAT LICENSING. PROCESS I THINK

02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:20.358
AND I THINK JUST THE WAY I

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:22.761
WOULD THINK ABOUT IT IS. IF WE

02:18:22.827 --> 02:18:26.364
PUT IN I MENTION THIS WHEN THE

02:18:26.431 --> 02:18:26.965

CANNABIS LICENSE. IN THE

02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:30.869
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I THINK

02:18:30.935 --> 02:18:32.137
WE HAVE. ALMOST ZERO

02:18:32.203 --> 02:18:33.838
PARTICIPATION JUST BECAUSE OF

02:18:33.905 --> 02:18:37.042

HAVE THROW YEAH OVER THE YEARS

02:18:50.488 --> 02:18:51.489
I THINK I'VE ONLY BEEN THIS

02:18:51.556 --> 02:18:52.991
POSITION FOR TWO YEARS BUT- I

02:18:53.058 --> 02:18:54.259

THAT WE TRIED TO BE REALLY-

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:04.869
OBJECTIVE WHEN A LICENSING

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:06.037

UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS KIND OF

02:19:13.144 --> 02:19:15.580
A- IS A WORKLOAD FOR PEOPLE AND

BEEN- OBJECTIVE AND TRY TO

02:20:24.415 --> 02:20:25.450
TREAT EVERYONE FAIRLY UP. UNDER

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:28.987
THE PERCENT. OR TRYING TO MAKE.

02:20:29.053 --> 02:20:29.554
CERTAINLY ALL OF US IN RURAL

02:20:29.621 --> 02:20:30.688
THAT ALSO THE INDUSTRY KNOWS

02:20:30.755 --> 02:20:33.057
THAT TO. SHOWING YOUR TEARS YOU

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:33.625
WOULDN'T SAY THAT IT'S BEEN

02:20:33.691 --> 02:20:35.293
YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU'VE-

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:36.995
TREATED PEOPLE. BUT BASS AND

02:20:37.061 --> 02:20:38.429
NOT LOOK BACK TREAT TREAT

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:39.998
PEOPLE UNFAIRLY. I DON'T

02:20:40.064 --> 02:20:41.566
BELIEVE SO. AND HISTORICALLY

02:20:41.633 --> 02:20:43.668
BEFORE YOU GOT THERE WOULD YOU

02:20:43.735 --> 02:20:46.070
WOULD YOU. I BELIEVE THAT OUR

02:20:46.137 --> 02:20:47.172
BELIEF IS THAT THERE'S ANY SORT

02:20:47.238 --> 02:20:49.140
OF UNFAIR. UNEQUAL TREATMENT

02:20:49.207 --> 02:20:51.843
NOT A NO I AM. JUST HELP ME I

02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:52.977
HAD BEEN ON THE GALA CONTROL

02:20:53.044 --> 02:20:54.879
COMMISSION FOR SIX YEARS PRIOR

02:20:54.946 --> 02:20:57.382
TO THIS I DID IT. AT THE STATE

02:20:57.448 --> 02:20:58.750
IN ANOTHER STATE AGENCY BETWEEN

02:20:58.817 --> 02:21:01.586
BUT- AS AS KIND OF I GUESS AN

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:03.254
OUTSIDER- WHEN I VIEW THE

02:21:03.321 --> 02:21:05.323
BUREAU I DID NOT FIND THAT I

02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:07.292
DID NOT HAVE THAT CONCERN THAT

02:21:07.358 --> 02:21:08.393
THEY WERE TREATING PEOPLE-

02:21:08.459 --> 02:21:10.762
UNFAIRLY. CERTAINLY WE GIVE-

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:11.996
RECOMMENDATIONS PEOPLE DON'T

02:21:12.063 --> 02:21:14.132
LIKE AND- WE HAVE TO SUPPORT

02:21:14.199 --> 02:21:15.500
THEM AND IF WE DON'T THE

02:21:15.567 --> 02:21:16.067
COMMISSION WELL THEN FIND A

02:21:16.134 --> 02:21:17.635
DIFFERENT. MAKE DIFFERENT

02:21:17.702 --> 02:21:19.904
VERSIONS SO WE'RE ALWAYS- I

02:21:19.971 --> 02:21:22.774
THINK IT'S VERY TRUE. AND WE

02:21:22.841 --> 02:21:24.209
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

02:21:24.275 --> 02:21:28.046
ABLE TO- YOU KNOW ORDER. THIS

02:21:28.112 --> 02:21:32.550
IN SOME WE GIVE. THE THIRTY TWO

02:21:32.617 --> 02:21:34.953
LIMITED- TO YOUR POSITIONS FOR

02:21:35.019 --> 02:21:36.988
LICENSING WHY WHY THE NEED FOR

02:21:37.055 --> 02:21:40.124
MORE. WELL SO THESE ARE I MEAN

02:21:40.191 --> 02:21:41.759
THOSE ARE JUST STRICTLY FOR THE

02:21:41.826 --> 02:21:43.127
ANALYTICAL POSITIONS THERE THE

02:21:43.194 --> 02:21:46.097
SSA NAY GPA LEVEL THE- THE

02:21:46.164 --> 02:21:49.834
REQUESTED WE HAD FOR THE- FOR

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:50.702
THE I BELIEVE IT EIGHT

02:21:50.768 --> 02:21:52.737
POSITIONS IS STRICTLY FOR THE

02:21:52.804 --> 02:21:55.673
NON ANALYTICAL TO SUPPORT WORK

02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.509
THINGS SAID WE WANT TO WE

02:21:57.575 --> 02:21:59.244
RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T WANT

02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:00.044
THE ANALYSTS TO DO TO TAKE AWAY

02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:01.412
FROM THE IMPORTANT BUT THEY'RE

02:22:01.479 --> 02:22:03.047
DOING. AND THESE ARE THINGS

02:22:03.114 --> 02:22:04.816
THAT ARE MORE ROUTINE THE YOU

02:22:04.883 --> 02:22:06.518
KNOW IF USE SETTING UP FILES

02:22:06.584 --> 02:22:07.919
AND SENATE REVIEWING SENDING

02:22:07.986 --> 02:22:09.587
OUT LETTERS AND DOING ALL THOSE

02:22:09.654 --> 02:22:11.189
THINGS THE WORKLOAD IS NOT

02:22:11.256 --> 02:22:12.490
GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S

02:22:12.557 --> 02:22:14.592
JUST THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS

02:22:14.659 --> 02:22:15.627
COME IT THEY'RE GOING TO DO

02:22:15.693 --> 02:22:16.861
THOSE THINGS FOR THESE-

02:22:16.928 --> 02:22:18.863
APPLICATION SO WHAT DOES THE

02:22:18.930 --> 02:22:21.366
ANALYSTS. THEIR WORKLOAD TO PAY

02:22:21.432 --> 02:22:23.902
ON OF TYPE OF THIS HAVE HOW DO

02:22:23.968 --> 02:22:26.104
IT WITH THE SEARCH ARE WITH THE

02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:27.605
WITH THAT WE COULD THIS IS

02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:28.773
PARCEL OUT BECAUSE IT IS

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:31.576
CORRECT I'M GOING WORKLOAD FOR

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:35.013
IS GOING PRES NOT GONNA WAIT

WHAT. OLDER WORKERS. IT IS THE

02:22:40.618 --> 02:22:41.886
ONE WHY DO YOU THINK THE

02:22:41.953 --> 02:22:44.455
AUDITOR FOUND ON A LACK OF

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:46.324
EFFICIENCY WITH SOME OF THE

02:22:46.391 --> 02:22:48.793
SOME OF THE STAFF YEAH I

02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:50.094
THEY'RE SAYING THAT THEIR

02:22:50.161 --> 02:22:52.931
BELIEF IS THAT. THERE MAY NOT

02:22:52.997 --> 02:22:54.599
BE A NEED FOR ANY MORE STAFF

02:22:54.666 --> 02:22:57.468
WHICH I ALWAYS LIKE TO HEAR. I

02:22:57.535 --> 02:22:58.069
THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE

02:22:58.136 --> 02:23:00.305
LOOKING. DO A HARD LOOK AT WHAT

02:23:00.371 --> 02:23:01.839
OUT OF THOSE THIRTY TWO WE NEED

02:23:01.906 --> 02:23:02.807
TO COME BACK TO YOU FOR NEXT

02:23:02.874 --> 02:23:04.309
YEAR. I MEAN WE ARE STILL

02:23:04.375 --> 02:23:05.476
WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

02:23:05.543 --> 02:23:06.744
GAINING EFFICIENCIES AND WE'RE

02:23:06.811 --> 02:23:07.645
GOING WE KNOW WE HAVE TO

02:23:07.712 --> 02:23:09.080
JUSTIFY THOSE POSITIONS SO THAT

02:23:09.147 --> 02:23:10.615
IS SOMETHING WE ARE WILL BE

02:23:10.682 --> 02:23:13.551
COMING BACK TO NEXT YEAR TO DO.

02:23:13.618 --> 02:23:15.153
SO IT'S NOT AN INCREASE RIGHT

02:23:15.219 --> 02:23:16.454
NOW IN THOSE THIRTY TWO ON THE

02:23:16.521 --> 02:23:18.156
ANALYTICAL POSITIONS THIS IS

02:23:18.222 --> 02:23:19.991
KIND OF A- A NEW WORKLOAD THAT

02:23:20.058 --> 02:23:20.959
WE ARE ADDRESSING AND I

02:23:21.025 --> 02:23:22.260
SHOULDN'T SAY NEW WORKLOAD

02:23:22.327 --> 02:23:23.094
BECAUSE IT THE ART WE ARE DOING

02:23:23.161 --> 02:23:24.429
SOME OF THAT RIGHT NOW. IT HAS

02:23:24.495 --> 02:23:26.364
INCREASED SINCE WE IMPLEMENTED

SOME THE AUDITOR'S

02:23:27.432 --> 02:23:28.599

WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AGAIN TO

02:23:30.268 --> 02:23:32.070
KEEP US ON TRACK. MAKING SURE

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:34.872
THAT WE CAN GET THOSE CASES DOT

02:23:34.939 --> 02:23:36.474
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE. A LIVER

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:40.511
ANALYSTS DOING- DUTIES ARE

02:23:40.578 --> 02:23:41.980
DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE

02:23:42.046 --> 02:23:43.881

SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO- A

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.258
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION THEY

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:55.259
HAVE TO TAKE CALLS FROM THE

INDUSTRY THEY HAD TO WORK ON

02:23:56.995 --> 02:23:58.162

ESTABLISHMENTS MORE OFTEN OVER

02:25:57.748 --> 02:25:59.217
THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD PERSIST AT

02:25:59.283 --> 02:26:02.553
THE END OF THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD.

02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:04.255
IT SEEMS LIKE TO BE TO BE THE

02:26:04.322 --> 02:26:06.491
SAME AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE

02:26:06.557 --> 02:26:08.092

SPREADING IT OUT OVER TWO YEARS

02:26:10.094 --> 02:26:10.928
WHY WOULD THAT BE ADDITIONAL

02:27:48.726 --> 02:27:50.027
THEY'RE JUST BECAUSE THEY NEED

02:27:50.094 --> 02:27:53.397

02:28:10.481 --> 02:28:12.016
THAT WE HAD SEEN. OMIT

02:28:12.083 --> 02:28:12.617

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:18.048
INDIVIDUAL AND- A WHOLE CLASS

02:34:18.115 --> 02:34:19.850
OF. TWO THIRDS MORE THAN ONCE

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:21.185
REALLY LATE ALSO OR IS ONE THAT

02:34:21.251 --> 02:34:23.454
WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW- WE

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:25.689
MENTIONED- CASES GET APOSTLE

02:34:25.756 --> 02:34:27.591
ROLES IS ONE MARYSVILLE. I MEAN

02:34:27.658 --> 02:34:29.693
THERE'S YOU KNOW. IF YOU WANNA

02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:31.395
PERCENTAGES BE HARD FOR ME TO

02:34:31.462 --> 02:34:32.796
GUESS I WOULD- GIVING US

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:34.565
MISSION IS NOT THE ENTIRE. CARD

02:34:34.632 --> 02:34:35.899
CLUB INTERVIEW BY. BY CHANCE

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:37.334
BUT I WOULD SAY FIFTEEN TWENTY

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:38.402
PERCENT. BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY

02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:40.804
MATTER HOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGES

02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:42.539
I MEAN WHAT WHETHER IT. BE

02:34:42.606 --> 02:34:44.041
GREEN JUSTICE OF THE 1% IS VERY

02:34:44.108 --> 02:34:46.343
IMPORTANT. MORE NO ABSOLUTELY

02:34:46.410 --> 02:34:50.381
DOES BECAUSE- AGAIN. IF THIS IS

02:34:50.447 --> 02:34:53.751
AS- IS MASS PROBLEM YOU HANDLE

02:34:53.817 --> 02:34:56.453
IT BY. CHANGING YOUR ENTIRE

02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:59.256
SYSTEM TO ADDRESS. ALL THE

02:34:59.323 --> 02:35:01.659
ESTABLISHMENTS EQUALLY. IF THIS

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:04.628
IS. SOMETHING HAPPENING WITH

02:35:04.695 --> 02:35:07.898
ONLY YOU KNOW. TEN OR LET'S SAY

02:35:07.965 --> 02:35:12.436
20% OF A POPULATION HE I WOULD

02:35:12.503 --> 02:35:13.270
ASSUME THAT YOU WOULD BE A

02:35:13.337 --> 02:35:15.005
LITTLE MORE TARGET BECAUSE WHY

02:35:15.072 --> 02:35:17.641
WHY WOULD YOU. WASTE RESOURCES

02:35:17.708 --> 02:35:20.044
ON THE PORTAL QUOTE OTHER 80%

02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:24.948
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY. ANY

02:35:25.015 --> 02:35:27.051
SUSPICION THAT THERE IS. A

02:35:27.117 --> 02:35:28.452
LEGAL ACTIVITY GOING BUT THAT

02:35:28.519 --> 02:35:29.520
WOULD ASSUME THAT THAT THE

02:35:29.586 --> 02:35:31.155
TARGET SEE STATIC SO I MEAN AS

02:35:31.221 --> 02:35:33.190
AS YOU ADDRESS MONEY LAUNDERING

02:35:33.257 --> 02:35:35.592
ONE LOCATION- AND EITHER COME

02:35:35.659 --> 02:35:37.127
COMPLIANCE WE TAKE SOME KIND OF

02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:38.062
ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST

02:35:38.128 --> 02:35:39.329
THEM. WHAT WOULD BE THE NATURAL

02:35:39.396 --> 02:35:42.933
RESPONSE BY A SOMEONE WANTS TO

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:43.467
HONOR MONIES TO SWITCH TO

02:35:43.534 --> 02:35:45.335
ANOTHER LOCATION. SO IF IT'S A

02:35:45.402 --> 02:35:46.937
YEAH I PROBABLY SHUTS OUT ATTIC

02:35:47.004 --> 02:35:48.539
YEAH RIGHT BUT IF YOU SHUT DOWN

02:35:48.605 --> 02:35:49.740
ONE LOCATION THAT'S ANOTHER

02:35:49.807 --> 02:35:51.742
QUICK KISS PARTS OF. THE NUMBER

02:35:51.809 --> 02:35:53.410
STILL STAYS THE SAME. OR STILL

02:35:53.477 --> 02:35:54.411
CHASING THE PROBLEM THAT WE

02:35:54.478 --> 02:35:55.412
NEED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE

02:35:55.479 --> 02:35:56.513
WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT AGREE

02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:59.416
DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT- WHAT

02:35:59.483 --> 02:36:00.017
WHAT I HEARD FROM THE DIRECTOR

02:36:00.084 --> 02:36:02.319
WAS A- ACROSS THE BOARD BROAD

02:36:02.386 --> 02:36:04.855
BRUSH APPROACH. TO THE ISSUE.

02:36:04.922 --> 02:36:07.524
NOT A- TARGETED APPROACH WHICH

02:36:07.591 --> 02:36:09.760
SEEMS MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT.

02:36:09.827 --> 02:36:12.763
YOUR FUND AGAIN. COM THAT. I'M

02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:13.597

SPENDING IF YOU TREAT. WRAPPING

02:36:19.470 --> 02:36:21.638
UP PLANS TO RAMP UP ENFORCEMENT

02:36:21.705 --> 02:36:23.907
OR LICENSING ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:36:23.974 --> 02:36:25.709
AND YOU HAVE. THE SAME NO

02:36:25.776 --> 02:36:28.779
LOGISTICS. PERCENT NOT EVEN THE

02:36:28.846 --> 02:36:30.447
85% THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

02:36:30.514 --> 02:36:33.617
EARLIER. 70% OF. US MISSED

02:36:33.684 --> 02:36:36.220
REALLY HAVEN'T EXHIBITED A KEY

02:36:36.286 --> 02:36:37.788
PROBLEM MORE. SUSPICIOUS

02:36:37.855 --> 02:36:39.723
ACTIVITY BUT YOU'RE SPENDING

02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:42.993
ALL THESE RESOURCES TO. AGAIN

02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:45.162
ASKED THEM TO SORT OF X. Y. Z.

02:36:45.229 --> 02:36:47.798
THAT THE LEASE QUESTION AS- TO

02:36:47.865 --> 02:36:50.467
WHAT NO WONDER THERE'S AN

02:36:50.534 --> 02:36:53.804
EFFICIENCY GOING ON. AT YOU.

02:36:53.871 --> 02:36:55.038
WITH THE TWENTY CHANNELS WHAT

WERE WE DON'T WANT TO BE THERE

02:36:56.006 --> 02:36:56.507
THERE'S A WE WILL TO ENSURE

02:36:56.573 --> 02:36:58.075
THAT PROBABLY DOES OCCUR AND SO

02:36:58.142 --> 02:36:58.642
HOW WE KNOW IF THAT PROBLEM

02:36:58.709 --> 02:37:00.344
SHIFTING WE'RE TAKING FORSMAN.

02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:01.345

LOCATIONS SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:37:06.683 --> 02:37:08.786
THE LEVEL OF THE PROBLEM IS AND

02:37:08.852 --> 02:37:09.620
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

02:37:09.686 --> 02:37:11.355
PROBABLY IS MIGRATING TO THE

02:37:11.421 --> 02:37:12.289
CASINO THAT'S I THINK WHAT US

02:37:12.356 --> 02:37:13.891

BEGIN I THOUGHT. THE FIRST

02:38:50.888 --> 02:38:53.957
PERSON YES- MADAM CHAIR DR

02:38:54.024 --> 02:38:57.494
WEBBER- MEMBERS OF THE-

02:38:57.561 --> 02:38:59.563
SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN

LEVEL IT. ENDING A PLAYER CLUB

02:39:04.268 --> 02:39:07.204
INTERNET THEIR BASE IN VAN BUT-

02:39:07.271 --> 02:39:09.940
BEFORE I. IN IN ANOTHER LIFE I

02:39:10.007 --> 02:39:12.376
WAS- ASSISTANT CHIEF DEPUTY LA

02:39:12.442 --> 02:39:14.945
CITY CONTROLLER AND USED TO DO

02:39:15.012 --> 02:39:18.882
AUDITS- WHAT I WOULD STRONGLY

02:39:18.949 --> 02:39:20.517
COMMAND TO THIS COMMITTEE. IS

02:39:20.584 --> 02:39:25.188
THAT BEFORE YOU TAKE ANY ACTION.

02:39:25.255 --> 02:39:27.324
APPROPRIATING A NICKEL CUT IN

02:39:27.391 --> 02:39:30.527
HALF FOR THESE ACTIVITIES YOU

02:39:30.594 --> 02:39:32.529
GO BACK AND YOU REALLY LOOK AT

02:39:32.596 --> 02:39:36.099
THE AUDIT AND YOU LOOK AT THE-

02:39:36.166 --> 02:39:38.635
TAPE OF THE HEARING I MEAN I

02:39:38.702 --> 02:39:40.203
THINK IT'S AT LEAST FROM MY

02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:42.940
PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS NOT IN THE

02:39:43.006 --> 02:39:44.241
WHEEL HOUSE OF THE DEPARTMENT

02:39:44.308 --> 02:39:48.145

02:39:48.211 --> 02:39:52.015
MORE EQUIPPED TO DO LICENSING

02:39:52.082 --> 02:39:52.916
IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER

02:39:52.983 --> 02:39:55.686

02:39:55.752 --> 02:39:57.187
AND THEY DO IT THEY DON'T MISS

02:39:57.254 --> 02:40:00.223
DEADLINES- AND I WOULD-

02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:02.459
SUGGESTS THAT THIS COMMITTEE

02:40:02.526 --> 02:40:04.461
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ALTERNATIVE

02:40:04.528 --> 02:40:15.339
THANK YOU THANK YOU. VENTURE

BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO TALK

02:40:31.054 --> 02:40:34.124
ABOUT THE BAFFLING ON TESTIMONY

02:40:34.191 --> 02:40:38.528
THAT WE HEARD. THE AUDIT

02:40:38.595 --> 02:40:43.433
ADDRESSED LICENSING ISSUES AND-

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:45.302
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS

02:40:45.369 --> 02:40:46.103
WITH THAT WHICH ARE WELL

02:40:46.169 --> 02:40:47.938
ESTABLISHED SOMEHOW THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

JUSTIFICATION FOR THIRTY NEW.

02:40:58.749 --> 02:41:03.053
E. WISE FOR ENFORCEMENT.

02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:06.289
LICENSING IS NOT THE SAME AS

02:41:06.356 --> 02:41:07.991
ENFORCEMENT ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED

02:41:08.058 --> 02:41:11.061
TO CONFLATE TO ARM THE AUDIT AS

02:41:11.128 --> 02:41:13.130
IS POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS

02:41:13.196 --> 02:41:14.931
BY THE LA OWN STAFF THE AUDIT

02:41:14.998 --> 02:41:16.900
MAKES NO MENTION OF AN

02:41:16.967 --> 02:41:19.169
ENFORCEMENT ISSUE YET YOU HAVE

02:41:19.236 --> 02:41:21.138

FOR ENFORCEMENT WHICH- IS. NOT

02:41:28.745 --> 02:41:31.148
JUSTIFIED AND JUST TO POINT OUT

02:41:31.214 --> 02:41:33.984
ONE OF MANY FACTORS ONE YOU'VE

02:41:34.051 --> 02:41:35.485
GOT LESS THAN HALF THE NUMBER

02:41:35.552 --> 02:41:37.254
CAR CLUB JUDGE TWENTY YEARS AGO

02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:39.890
CURRENTLY SO IF ANYTHING BEEN

02:41:39.956 --> 02:41:41.825
MOUNTAIN THE PORTS AND SHOULD

02:41:41.892 --> 02:41:44.061
BE DOWN SECOND YOU HAVE A

02:41:44.127 --> 02:41:45.862
REGULATION THAT WILL ELIMINATE

02:41:45.929 --> 02:41:47.864
50% OF THE GAMES BEING PLAYED

02:41:47.931 --> 02:41:49.232
IN CARD CLUBS WHICH RAISES

02:41:49.299 --> 02:41:51.334
OTHER CONCERNS BUT CERTAINLY

02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:53.703
THERE WOULD BE A NEED FOR US

02:41:53.770 --> 02:41:55.372

MINISTRATION FIND. THIS TO

02:42:08.251 --> 02:42:09.786

02:48:32.702 --> 02:48:34.103
ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ARE

02:48:34.170 --> 02:48:36.005
RECOMMENDING APPROVAL- THERE IS

02:48:36.072 --> 02:48:36.739
THAT THERE HAS BEEN

02:48:36.806 --> 02:48:39.075
JUSTIFICATION HOWEVER WE WOULD

02:48:39.142 --> 02:48:41.644
NOTE THAT IT IS NOT A PERMANENT

02:48:41.711 --> 02:48:43.746
FUNDING SOLUTIONS TO

02:48:43.813 --> 02:48:46.349
SUPPORTING- THE BUREAU AND

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:48.184
SPECIFICALLY THIS ISSUE OF THE

02:48:48.251 --> 02:48:49.719
DECLINE AN ON GOING CRIMINAL

02:48:49.786 --> 02:48:51.054
FINE IF YOU REVENUE DEPOSIT

02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:52.989
INTO DENIED IDENTIFICATION FUND

02:48:53.056 --> 02:48:54.290
TO SUPPORT THEM. HAS BEEN

02:48:54.357 --> 02:48:55.124
REQUIRED TO BACK FILL SINCE

02:48:55.191 --> 02:48:56.860
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO

02:48:56.926 --> 02:48:57.727
IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF YEARS

02:48:57.794 --> 02:48:59.529
THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH US

02:48:59.596 --> 02:49:01.431
SO TO ADDRESS THIS ON A MORE

02:49:01.498 --> 02:49:02.332
PERMANENT BASIS WE ARE

02:49:02.398 --> 02:49:03.600
RECOMMENDING TAKING A DIFFERENT

02:49:03.666 --> 02:49:06.269
APPROACH TO SUPPORTING- THE

02:49:06.336 --> 02:49:07.437
BUREAU SPECIFICALLY WE ARE

02:49:07.504 --> 02:49:08.771
RECOMMENDING REQUIRING THAT

02:49:08.838 --> 02:49:10.507
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PARTIALLY

02:49:10.573 --> 02:49:13.309
SUPPORT THE BUREAU BEGINNING IN

02:49:13.376 --> 02:49:13.877
TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY HAVING

02:49:13.943 --> 02:49:15.178
THEM PAY FOR A PORTION OF THE

02:49:15.245 --> 02:49:17.146
SERVICES. THAT THEY RECEIVE AND

02:49:17.213 --> 02:49:19.282
SO CURRENTLY- THESE LOCAL

02:49:19.349 --> 02:49:20.750
AGENCIES ABOUT FORTY SIX

02:49:20.817 --> 02:49:22.719
COUNTIES ARE NOT BEING CHARGED

02:49:22.785 --> 02:49:23.753
FOR SERVICES AND THAT'S A

02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:24.954
SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT THAT THEY

02:49:25.021 --> 02:49:27.323
RECEIVE- AT THE SAME TIME

02:49:27.390 --> 02:49:28.892
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT IN CHARGE

02:49:28.958 --> 02:49:30.293
FOR THEIR SERVICES THERE REALLY

02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:31.394
IS LITTLE INCENTIVE TO THINK

02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:34.564
ABOUT- HOW WHAT TYPE OF

02:49:34.631 --> 02:49:35.598
EVIDENCE TO CLAPTON KIND

02:49:35.665 --> 02:49:37.000
PRIORITIZING WHAT THE COMMITTED

02:49:37.066 --> 02:49:40.136
TO JAY BEYOND. ITS CAPACITY AS

02:49:40.203 --> 02:49:42.705
WE DO CAN I TAKE TIME TO

02:49:42.772 --> 02:49:43.606
IMPLEMENT SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:46.509
MANY ONE YEAR DELAY IN ADDITION

02:49:46.576 --> 02:49:48.244
TO THAT ARE RECOMMENDING- THE

02:49:48.311 --> 02:49:50.513
LEGISLATURE TO ACT TO BE OJ TO

02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:54.250
REPORT PLAN FOR ALL CHELATING.

02:49:54.317 --> 02:49:56.686
THE ARE. I'M THE LOCAL WOULD

02:49:56.753 --> 02:49:57.554
REPRESENT WERE WRECKED WOULD UP

02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:00.323
OF ABOUT 50% OF THE BUREAU'S

02:50:00.390 --> 02:50:02.659
OPERATING BUDGETS- AND THIS

02:50:02.725 --> 02:50:04.761
WOULD EFFECTIVELY REPLACE THE

02:50:04.827 --> 02:50:05.662
AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND THAT'S

02:50:05.728 --> 02:50:07.230
BEING PROPOSED AS PART OF THIS

02:50:07.297 --> 02:50:09.232
YEAR'S BUDGET DOJ AND WORKING

02:50:09.299 --> 02:50:10.567
THROUGH THE PLAN COULD TALK TO

02:50:10.633 --> 02:50:12.201
STAKEHOLDERS AND STRUCTURED IN

02:50:12.268 --> 02:50:14.971
VARIOUS WAYS TO- RECOGNIZE YOU

02:50:15.038 --> 02:50:16.039
KNOW DIFFERENT DIFFERENCES

02:50:16.105 --> 02:50:17.106
BASED ON THE TYPE OF FRIENDS EX

02:50:17.173 --> 02:50:19.142
SERVICE THAT'S OFFERED ON THE

02:50:19.208 --> 02:50:21.110
SIZE OF THE AGENCY AND ALSO

02:50:21.177 --> 02:50:23.279
SPEED OF SERVICE AND SO WE

02:50:23.346 --> 02:50:24.847
WOULD RECOMMEND XIN OF THAT

02:50:24.914 --> 02:50:26.149
REPORT IN TIME FOR CONSIDER. AS

02:50:26.215 --> 02:50:27.684
PART OF MY PEERS BUT AND IF THE

02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:29.385
STRUCTURE PER LEE IT WOULD

02:50:29.452 --> 02:50:30.553
PROVIDE A PERMANENT FUNDING

02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:32.855
SOLUTION TO SUPPORT THEIR

02:50:32.922 --> 02:50:35.158
OPERATIONS I'M JUST ONE LAST

02:50:35.224 --> 02:50:36.926
PIECE- THERE IS A SEPARATE

02:50:36.993 --> 02:50:38.928
REQUEST FOR NINE POINT FIVE

02:50:38.995 --> 02:50:39.629
MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR

02:50:39.696 --> 02:50:40.863
THIS CONSOLIDATED FORENSIC

02:50:40.930 --> 02:50:42.332
LABORATORY THAT WAS REFERENCED

02:50:42.398 --> 02:50:44.601
PREVIOUSLY THIS NEW APPROACH

02:50:44.667 --> 02:50:46.736
COULD CHANGE DOJ'S WORKLOAD IN

02:50:46.803 --> 02:50:48.605
OPERATIONS AND SO TO THE EXTENT

02:50:48.671 --> 02:50:50.340
IT DOES WE JUST RECOMMEND THE

02:50:50.406 --> 02:50:51.674
LEGISLATURE DIRECT DOJ TO MAKE

02:50:51.741 --> 02:50:53.209
SURE THAT ANY FUTURE FUNDING

02:50:53.276 --> 02:50:56.613
FOR REFLECT THOSE CHANGES. WE

02:50:56.679 --> 02:50:58.615
HAVE. COME ANY QUESTIONS

02:50:58.681 --> 02:51:02.352
MEMBERS. OKAY ONLY ONLY

02:51:02.418 --> 02:51:04.387
QUESTION I HAD WAS AND THIS IS-

02:51:04.454 --> 02:51:05.922
AND MAYBE YOU CAN REASSURED ME

02:51:05.989 --> 02:51:07.724
THAT THAT WOULD BE FINE THAT IF

02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:09.559
WE START CHARGING SOME OF THESE

02:51:09.626 --> 02:51:12.729
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR SERVICES

02:51:12.795 --> 02:51:13.396
THAT THEY MAY WANT FEWER

02:51:13.463 --> 02:51:16.532
SERVICES IN A TIME WHERE WE

02:51:16.599 --> 02:51:17.233
PROBABLY NEED GREATER SERVICE

02:51:17.300 --> 02:51:19.569
IS GIVEN THE NUMBER OF ISSUES

02:51:19.636 --> 02:51:21.137
THAT ARE BROUGHT UP AND PEOPLE

02:51:21.204 --> 02:51:23.606
WHO HAVE BEEN- SOMEHOW ANOTHER

02:51:23.673 --> 02:51:25.308
EXONERATED BECAUSE OF DNA

02:51:25.375 --> 02:51:26.609
EVIDENCE AND SO FORTH AND SO

02:51:26.676 --> 02:51:28.277
ON. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT

02:51:28.344 --> 02:51:30.513
THEY'LL BE FAIRNESS AND EQUITY

02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:32.682
FOR ALL PERSONS IF WE YOU KNOW

02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:33.816
IN SOME JURISDICTIONS CHOOSE

02:51:33.883 --> 02:51:35.151
NOT TO USE YOU AS MUCH BECAUSE

02:51:35.218 --> 02:51:36.819
IT ON THE RESOURCES A MAN CHAIR

02:51:36.886 --> 02:51:37.854
BERRY MILLER FROM THE

02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:39.555
GIRLFRIEND SIX SERVICES AND I

02:51:39.622 --> 02:51:40.690
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:51:40.757 --> 02:51:43.459
COMMENT ON THAT QUESTION- WE

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:46.729
THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE DON'T-

02:51:46.796 --> 02:51:48.398
THAT'S OUR CONCERN AS WELL IS

02:51:48.464 --> 02:51:52.769
THAT. IF WE DO START TO- PUT A

02:51:52.835 --> 02:51:55.204
FINE ON LOCAL AGENCIES FOR

02:51:55.271 --> 02:51:58.174
FORENSIC SERVICES THERE WILL BE

02:51:58.241 --> 02:51:59.442
HARD CHOICES THAT HAVE TO BE

02:51:59.509 --> 02:52:00.777
MADE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

02:52:00.843 --> 02:52:02.912
SOMEBODY CAN AFFORD TO SUBMIT A

02:52:02.979 --> 02:52:04.681
PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT MAY OR

02:52:04.747 --> 02:52:09.052
MAY NOT LEAD TO. A ANALYSIS

02:52:09.118 --> 02:52:10.420
THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES CLOSER

02:52:10.486 --> 02:52:12.055
TO A CASE WE'RE ALSO VERY

02:52:12.121 --> 02:52:13.990
CONCERNED WITH THE FACT THAT-

02:52:14.057 --> 02:52:16.159
THERE WOULDN'T BE EQUAL ACCESS

02:52:16.225 --> 02:52:17.660
TO THAT JUSTICE WITH THE

02:52:17.727 --> 02:52:19.062
VICTIMS OF CALIFORNIA THAT

02:52:19.128 --> 02:52:20.863
ACTUALLY DO WANT THEIR EVIDENCE

02:52:20.930 --> 02:52:23.633
ANALYZED. AND WE DID PROVIDE A

02:52:23.700 --> 02:52:25.234
REPORT TALKING A LOT ABOUT

02:52:25.301 --> 02:52:28.304
THAT- IN AN ASSESSMENT OF WHERE

02:52:28.371 --> 02:52:29.072
WE WERE IN THE BUREAU OF

02:52:29.138 --> 02:52:30.306
FORENSIC SERVICES RELATED

02:52:30.373 --> 02:52:32.608

QUESTIONS. YES MADAM CHAIR

YOU THAT WHEN WE START LOOKING

02:52:45.021 --> 02:52:48.057
AT MAKING DECISIONS- OF WHAT TO

02:52:48.124 --> 02:52:50.093
SEND IN BASED ON WHAT AN ITEM

02:52:50.159 --> 02:52:51.894
WAS GONNA COST TO BE PROCESSED

02:52:51.961 --> 02:52:53.863
BY A FORENSIC LAB WILL

02:52:53.930 --> 02:52:54.697
DEFINITELY BE TAKEN INTO

02:52:54.764 --> 02:52:56.466
CONSIDERATION BY NOT ONLY

02:52:56.532 --> 02:52:57.734
PLEASE CHOOSE BUT CITY MANAGERS

02:52:57.800 --> 02:52:59.402

BUDGETS. AND IT WAS AS THE LA-

02:53:01.938 --> 02:53:03.506
SAID YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO

02:53:03.573 --> 02:53:04.440
MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON

02:53:04.507 --> 02:53:05.842
PRIORITIZING WHAT EVIDENCE TO

02:53:05.908 --> 02:53:08.277
SEND TEN- THE PROBLEM WITH THAT

02:53:08.344 --> 02:53:09.746
IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT

02:53:09.812 --> 02:53:12.181
EVIDENCE WILL PRODUCE IN TERMS

02:53:12.248 --> 02:53:13.249
OF SENDING SOMETHING AND THAT

02:53:13.316 --> 02:53:15.618
IS OF HIGH VALUE OUR LOW VALUE

02:53:15.685 --> 02:53:18.187
CONNECTS THE DOTS TWO OF THE

02:53:18.254 --> 02:53:19.288
CRIMES THAT WE DON'T KNOW- THAT

02:53:19.355 --> 02:53:21.457
COMMITTED HOW CAN IT HELP US.

02:53:21.524 --> 02:53:22.925
MAKE A CASE FOR EXAMPLE OTHER

02:53:22.992 --> 02:53:25.361
INDIVIDUALS IT'S HARD TO TELL-

02:53:25.428 --> 02:53:26.629
THE MORE INFORMATION THE MORE

02:53:26.696 --> 02:53:27.930
SAMPLES WE HAVE THE MORE

02:53:27.997 --> 02:53:29.232
EVIDENCE THAT'S TURNED ON I

02:53:29.298 --> 02:53:31.734
THINK. MORE PEOPLE ARE SERVED-

02:53:31.801 --> 02:53:33.169
IT IN TERMS OF THE JUSTICE

02:53:33.236 --> 02:53:34.804
SYSTEM. THEN IF FOR MAKING

02:53:34.871 --> 02:53:37.106
DECISIONS ON HOW MUCH IT COST

02:53:37.173 --> 02:53:41.477
TO SEND SOMETHING IN. ANYONE

02:53:41.544 --> 02:53:42.578
ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I THAT

02:53:42.645 --> 02:53:43.913
THAT'S MY MAJOR CONCERN WITH

02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:45.782
THE WITH THE PROPOSAL- MAYBE

02:53:45.848 --> 02:53:48.451
I'VE BEEN- INUNDATED WITH

02:53:48.518 --> 02:53:49.685
READING THE BOOK JUST MURPHY

02:53:49.752 --> 02:53:54.457
JUST MERCY. AND KNEW MOST OF

02:53:54.524 --> 02:53:56.292
THE STUFF BUT I WAS AS ONE ONCE

02:53:56.359 --> 02:53:57.960
AGAIN. AS THE GOVERNOR SAID

02:53:58.027 --> 02:53:59.428
IT'S BETTER TO BE GUILTY AND

02:53:59.495 --> 02:54:00.863
RATES THAN TO BE POOR AND THE

02:54:00.930 --> 02:54:02.398
SECOND CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S

02:54:02.465 --> 02:54:03.866
ALWAYS A CONCERN OF MINE THAT

02:54:03.933 --> 02:54:05.067
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT

02:54:05.134 --> 02:54:07.303
WE DO. I SERVICES PROVIDED FOR

02:54:07.370 --> 02:54:09.138
EVERYONE AND SOMETIMES PUTTING

02:54:09.205 --> 02:54:11.774
FEEL ME SERVICES- THEY'LL MAKE

02:54:11.841 --> 02:54:13.176
A DECISION NOT TO GO THAT WAY

02:54:13.242 --> 02:54:14.777
IN A MAYES TOLERATE THE PERSON

02:54:14.844 --> 02:54:16.145
OR THEY'LL MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:54:16.212 --> 02:54:16.979
WERE THE ONLY PUTTING THE

02:54:17.046 --> 02:54:18.681
THINGS THAT I WANT TO CONVICT

02:54:18.748 --> 02:54:19.215
SOMEBODY BUT NOT EXONERATE

02:54:19.282 --> 02:54:21.150
PEOPLE SO. IT'S AN ONGOING A

02:54:21.217 --> 02:54:22.218
BATTLE I GUESS WITH THE

02:54:22.285 --> 02:54:23.920
QUESTION OF BECAUSE EVERYONE

02:54:23.986 --> 02:54:25.555
DESERVES THE SAME LEVEL OF

02:54:25.621 --> 02:54:28.324
JUSTICE. AND THAN OTHERS YOU

02:54:28.391 --> 02:54:29.225
KNOW AND I THINK EVERYONE

02:54:29.292 --> 02:54:30.893
DESERVES A LAB THAT'S REALLY

02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:32.728
FUNCTIONAL AND REALLY SUPPORT

02:54:32.795 --> 02:54:34.964
IT. AND THAT'LL BIG SEATS CAN

02:54:35.031 --> 02:54:36.165
DO THAT A LITTLE BIT BETTER

02:54:36.232 --> 02:54:38.467
THAN WELL CITIES AND- SOLD IT

02:54:38.534 --> 02:54:42.405
BUT THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE

02:54:42.471 --> 02:54:43.039
OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY

02:54:43.105 --> 02:54:45.608
WILL TO HEAR FROM. OVER THE

02:54:45.675 --> 02:54:46.209
LAST THREE GROUP THAT WOULD DO

HERE. OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND

02:54:48.878 --> 02:54:49.979
ONCE FOR THOSE TWO GROUPS WOULD

02:54:50.046 --> 02:54:51.814
NOT AT THE FIFTH ITEM WHICH IS

02:54:51.881 --> 02:54:54.851
UPDATE- I'M SORRY TO. CATCH ME

02:54:54.917 --> 02:54:57.186
EITHER. TO ANY WHO TURNED YOU

02:54:57.253 --> 02:55:04.694
OWN. LARA. I THINK THESE THINGS

02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:05.995
OF US AROUND A- YOU KNOW RECALL

02:55:06.062 --> 02:55:08.598
ALL I THOUGHT MIKE. OH MY

ON INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE- USE

02:55:13.236 --> 02:55:19.108
DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM. WE

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:20.710
HAVE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

02:55:20.776 --> 02:55:22.879
OF CORRECTIONS CDC ARE FROM THE

03:02:29.405 --> 03:02:29.938
EXPLAINING WHAT WE SAW DURING

REFER TO AS CORRECTION FATIGUE.

03:02:37.212 --> 03:02:39.415
WITHOUT GIVING IT A NAME BUT WE

03:02:39.481 --> 03:02:40.582
STILL LACK THE RESOURCES TO

03:02:40.649 --> 03:02:43.452
ADDRESS IT. THE LACK OF

TO EXPOSURE DOES SOMETHING TO

03:02:48.457 --> 03:02:49.191
OUR MINDS BECAUSE I AS I

MENTIONED EARLIER WE SPEND MORE

03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:52.728
TIME IN PRISON. THAN WE DO AT

03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:55.331

TIME TO COME TO PRESENT. AND

03:02:57.466 --> 03:02:58.467
THE DEBRIEFING PROCESS THAT WE

03:02:58.534 --> 03:03:00.803
HAVE TO DO THERE ARE COMMUTE SO

03:03:00.869 --> 03:03:02.104
THAT WE DON'T COME HOME A

HIGH LEVEL SUBSTANCE ABUSE

03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:24.193
AMONG THE RANKS IT TAKES THAT

03:03:24.259 --> 03:03:26.295
TO TAKE THE CHILL OFF. WITH

RESPECT TO TIME OF SHARE A

03:03:28.330 --> 03:03:28.831
COUPLE OF EXPERIENCES IF YOU

03:03:28.897 --> 03:03:32.434
DON'T MIND. WHEN AN INMATE

03:03:32.501 --> 03:03:33.068
JUMPED TO THEIR DEATH FROM THE

03:03:33.135 --> 03:03:35.037
FOURTH HERE. EVEN THOUGH THEIR

03:03:35.104 --> 03:03:37.005
BRAIN APPEARS TO BE UNCONSCIOUS

03:03:37.072 --> 03:03:38.374
THEIR ARMS AND LEGS CONTINUED

03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:39.408
MOVED IN A FAILED ATTEMPT TO

03:03:39.475 --> 03:03:41.977
GET UP. WITH THEIR SHATTERED

03:03:42.044 --> 03:03:42.544
FACE AND TORSO STUCK TO THE

03:03:42.611 --> 03:03:44.980
GROUND. DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN

03:03:45.047 --> 03:03:46.582
THE OXYGEN IS DEPLETED FROM THE

03:03:46.648 --> 03:03:49.251
BRAIN ONE ONE HANGS THEMSELVES.

03:03:49.318 --> 03:03:49.852
THEIR BODIES FOUGHT VIOLENTLY

03:03:49.918 --> 03:03:53.389
LIKE A FISH. WHAT WERE TASKED.

03:03:53.455 --> 03:03:55.524
TO TRY TO CUT THEM DOWN SAFELY.

03:03:55.591 --> 03:03:56.825
I FORGOT TO MENTION THEIR FACES

03:03:56.892 --> 03:03:59.228
BLOW UP TWICE THE SIZE THAT'S

03:03:59.294 --> 03:04:00.262
AN IMAGE YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF

03:04:23.485 --> 03:04:26.121
AFRAID OF CONFIDENTIALITY.

03:04:26.188 --> 03:04:27.689
AFRAID THAT ONE WRONG WORD

03:04:27.756 --> 03:04:29.558
WOULD RESULT IN A WEAPONS

03:04:29.625 --> 03:04:30.092
RESTRICTION THAT WILL TAKE

THEIR JOB FROM THEM. IT WILL BE

03:04:34.062 --> 03:04:34.596
FURTHER UP THE CREEK WITHOUT A

EARLY IN MY CAREER IS WORKING A

UNIT AND WE WERE FEEDING THE

EVENING MEAL. OUR PARTNER YELLS

03:05:35.924 --> 03:05:37.860

AND CARED LIFTED THEM UP. MY

03:05:43.065 --> 03:05:44.967
OTHER PARTNER JUMPED UP AND

03:05:45.033 --> 03:05:47.202
TOOK THE NEEDS ARE. THAT WAS

03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:48.804
NINETEEN YEARS AGO AND I STILL

03:05:48.871 --> 03:05:57.613
SEE THE ENEMY IN MY MIND. OKAY.

03:05:57.679 --> 03:06:00.315
START LIKE AFTER THE INCIDENT

03:06:00.382 --> 03:06:01.817
WE'RE OFFER PEER SUPPORT IN

03:06:01.884 --> 03:06:03.552
BEING A YOUNG THE NEW OFFER I

03:06:03.619 --> 03:06:05.120
BELIEVED I WAS SUPERMAN I

03:06:05.187 --> 03:06:06.822
REFUSE AND WHEN I GOT HOME THAT

03:06:06.889 --> 03:06:08.423
NIGHT I CLOSED MY EYES AND

03:06:08.490 --> 03:06:10.192
COULD SEE THE INMATE WHO HAD

03:06:10.259 --> 03:06:14.730
DIED. NO MATTER HOW LONG AGO

03:06:14.796 --> 03:06:16.431
WAS SIGNIFICANT EVENT OR

03:06:16.498 --> 03:06:18.100
INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR

03:06:18.166 --> 03:06:21.003
CAREERS. WE CAN RECALL ALMOST

03:06:21.069 --> 03:06:22.905
EVERY SENSE OR A LITTLE DETAILS.

03:06:22.971 --> 03:06:24.339
THAT'S CORRECT LAUNCHERS WE SEE

03:06:24.406 --> 03:06:26.008
THINGS THAT NO PERSON SHOULD BE

03:06:26.074 --> 03:06:29.011
SUBJECTED TO. WE HAVE BEEN WE

03:06:29.077 --> 03:06:30.913
HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE OF STAFF

03:06:30.979 --> 03:06:33.248
SUICIDES THAT HAS BECOME AN

03:06:33.315 --> 03:06:35.384
EPIDEMIC. IN HIS LEAVING THOSE

03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:36.652
ALL SCRAMBLING TO UNDERSTAND

03:06:36.718 --> 03:06:39.254
THIS IS. I BELIEVE FIRST WE

03:06:39.321 --> 03:06:41.490
MUST LOOK AT WHAT HAS CHANGED

03:06:41.557 --> 03:06:42.291
IN THE DEPARTMENT DURING THIS

03:06:42.357 --> 03:06:45.494
TURN. WE SAW AN INCREASE OF. IN

03:06:45.561 --> 03:06:46.962
SUICIDES DURING THE FURLOUGH

03:06:47.029 --> 03:06:48.630
TIMES AS MANY OF OUR PARTNERS

03:06:48.697 --> 03:06:51.233
WERE LOSING EVERYTHING THEY OWN

03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:54.102
AS WE LOST 15% OF OUR PAY.

03:06:54.169 --> 03:06:56.271
AFTER THAT WE SAW IN A

03:06:56.338 --> 03:06:57.906
SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN

03:06:57.973 --> 03:06:59.675
STAFFING STANDARDIZED STAFFING.

03:06:59.741 --> 03:07:01.410
THAT THE STATE HAS ATTEMPTED TO

03:07:01.476 --> 03:07:03.879
USE A STANDARD STANDARDIZE RULE

03:07:03.946 --> 03:07:06.148
WHEN EACH AND EVERY PERSON IS

03:07:06.214 --> 03:07:07.983
DIFFERENT BASED ON LAYOUT AND

03:07:08.050 --> 03:07:09.885
DESIGN OR PROGRAM. THIS

03:07:09.952 --> 03:07:11.219
REDUCTION IS LEAVING OUR PRISON

03:07:11.286 --> 03:07:13.689
STAFFING LEVELS SO LOW THAT IT

03:07:13.755 --> 03:07:15.190
IS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET

03:07:15.257 --> 03:07:17.659
THE JOB DONE. MOST EMPLOYEES IN

03:07:17.726 --> 03:07:19.261
THE DEPARTMENT YOU DON'T WANT

03:07:19.328 --> 03:07:20.963
TO FAIL IN THEIR TAX BUT

03:07:21.029 --> 03:07:23.231
UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE. THIS IS

03:07:23.298 --> 03:07:25.334
WHAT THE STAFF CUTTING CORNERS

03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:27.035
JUST TO GET THE INMATES TO THE

03:07:27.102 --> 03:07:29.838
PROGRAMS. WHICH OPENS OURSELVES

03:07:29.905 --> 03:07:31.106
UP FOR DISCIPLINE TO THE

03:07:31.173 --> 03:07:33.775
DEPARTMENT. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT

03:07:33.842 --> 03:07:36.378
HAS CHANGED. IN THE DEPARTMENT

03:07:36.445 --> 03:07:37.679
HAS BEEN THE RELEASE A LOWER

03:07:37.746 --> 03:07:39.481
LEVEL WITH OFFENDERS AND THIS

03:07:39.548 --> 03:07:40.616
IS LEFT US WITH THE MOST

03:07:40.682 --> 03:07:42.684
VIOLENT INMATES REGULATION

03:07:42.751 --> 03:07:44.453
STRANGERS DEBTORS TIED THE

03:07:44.519 --> 03:07:46.221
DEPARTMENT'S HANDS IN DEALING

03:07:46.288 --> 03:07:48.256
WITH A MADE TO FILL THE PROGRAM

03:07:48.323 --> 03:07:50.192
AND ARE IN A MORE VIOLENT

03:07:50.258 --> 03:07:50.959
TOWARDS STAFF AND OTHER

03:07:51.026 --> 03:07:53.195
INMATES. MOST OF OUR LEVEL FOUR

03:07:53.261 --> 03:07:55.530
YARDS IN THE STATE HAVE SEEN AN

03:07:55.597 --> 03:07:57.532
INCREASE IN VIOLENCE IT IS

03:07:57.599 --> 03:07:58.967
ROUTINE FOR OUR STAFF TO DEAL

03:07:59.034 --> 03:08:01.169
WITH MULTIPLE BY THAT THE VENTS

03:08:01.236 --> 03:08:02.671
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WOOD

03:08:02.738 --> 03:08:04.940
NOBILITY THAT THE COMPRESS OR

03:08:05.007 --> 03:08:06.608
EVEN WRITE A REPORT BEFORE THE

03:08:06.675 --> 03:08:09.845
NEXT VIOLENT EVENT. THE CYCLE

03:08:09.911 --> 03:08:10.445
CONTINUES SOMETIMES INTO THE

03:08:10.512 --> 03:08:14.016
MAKESHIFT OR THE NEXT DAY. THE

03:08:14.082 --> 03:08:15.317
LEVEL OF VIOLENCE THAT STAFF

03:08:15.384 --> 03:08:16.551
FOR BEING SUBJECTED TO IT'S

03:08:16.618 --> 03:08:18.854
CAUSING AN INCREASE IN THE

03:08:18.920 --> 03:08:21.289
CASES OF PTSD. ADDING TO THIS

03:08:21.356 --> 03:08:23.091
PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT. WHEN

03:08:23.158 --> 03:08:24.159
AN OFFICER NEEDS TO TAKE A DAY

03:08:24.226 --> 03:08:26.561
OFF. FOR THEIR OWN MENTAL WELL

03:08:26.628 --> 03:08:28.163
BEING ANY OVERTIME THAT THEY

03:08:28.230 --> 03:08:29.931
HEARD GETS CONVERTED TO NORMAL

03:08:29.998 --> 03:08:33.502
PAY. THIS GREAT FEAR THAT THEIR

03:08:33.568 --> 03:08:35.203
PAY WILL BE REDUCED AND MEANS

03:08:35.270 --> 03:08:37.973
OFFERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO TAKE

03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:38.573
THE TIME OFF THAT THEY NEED TO

03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:41.109
RECOVER. THE DEPARTMENT HAS A

03:08:41.176 --> 03:08:44.046
PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM. AN EDP

03:08:44.112 --> 03:08:45.447
HOWEVER MOST EMPLOYEES WILL NOT

03:08:45.514 --> 03:08:48.817
UTILIZE IT. OUT OF FEAR WORST

03:08:48.884 --> 03:08:50.652
FEARS DERIVED FROM HELP QUICKLY

03:08:50.719 --> 03:08:52.054
DEPARTMENT TRIES TO DISCIPLINE

03:08:52.120 --> 03:08:53.755
STAFF FOR THE SMALLEST

03:08:53.822 --> 03:08:55.390
INFRACTION AND THAT MOST

03:08:55.457 --> 03:08:56.725
EMPLOYEES FEEL THAT THESE

03:08:56.792 --> 03:08:58.260
PROGRAMS WILL PUT THEIR CAREER

03:08:58.326 --> 03:09:00.962
RISK. SO STAFF WILL PUSH

03:09:01.029 --> 03:09:04.066
THROUGH. AND DEAL WITH. AND

03:09:04.132 --> 03:09:08.403
PTSD CONTINUES TO CREEP UP.

03:09:08.470 --> 03:09:09.371
THIS COULD BE IN THE FORM OF

03:09:09.438 --> 03:09:11.073
SELF MEDICATION ALCOHOL OR

BUT THINK THAT A LOT OF THE

03:41:04.718 --> 03:41:05.652
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

03:41:05.719 --> 03:41:07.087
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT THE LACK OF

03:41:09.389 --> 03:41:10.924
PARCEL TO THIS CONVERSATION WE

03:41:10.991 --> 03:41:12.826

CULTURAL ISSUE WITHIN CDC ARE

03:41:15.662 --> 03:41:18.365
THAT PROBABLY LEADS TO A LOT OF

03:41:18.431 --> 03:41:19.599
THE OUTCOMES ULTIMATELY THAT

03:41:19.666 --> 03:41:21.901
WE'RE- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:41:21.968 --> 03:41:24.504
I THINK INCLUDING. DOCTOR YOUR

03:41:24.571 --> 03:41:26.973
COMMENTS ABOUT. PHYSICIANS OR

03:41:27.040 --> 03:41:28.808
PSYCHIATRISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO

03:41:28.875 --> 03:41:31.211

03:41:31.277 --> 03:41:32.679
GET OVER RULES ARE OVER RUN BUT

03:41:32.746 --> 03:41:36.449
I JUST. SO THERE'S REALLY A LOT

03:41:36.516 --> 03:41:39.653
HERE TO THAT I THINK FOR US TO

03:41:39.719 --> 03:41:40.387
CONTINUE TO EXPLORE AND LOOK

03:41:40.453 --> 03:41:43.289

COME ALONG FOR CDC ARE. WHAT IN

03:41:47.093 --> 03:41:47.827
THE WORLD COULD BE THE

03:41:47.894 --> 03:41:52.198
THERAPEUTIC BASIS FOR. THE

03:41:52.265 --> 03:41:54.300
CAGES AND FOR TRYING TO. EVEN

03:41:54.367 --> 03:41:57.103
TEMPORARILY PUTTING SOMEBODY IN

03:41:57.170 --> 03:41:58.972
A CAGE AS PART OF THEIR

03:41:59.039 --> 03:42:01.307
TREATMENT PROGRAM AND DOESN'T

03:42:01.374 --> 03:42:03.576
THAT ABSOLUTELY AND DO WHAT

03:42:03.643 --> 03:42:06.112
EVER ELSE MIGHT BE BEING TRIED

03:42:06.179 --> 03:42:07.881
TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THAT

03:42:07.947 --> 03:42:09.582
SESSION AS I'M ASSUMING THAT

03:42:09.649 --> 03:42:12.185
THEY'RE NOT THERE FOR THAT'S

03:42:12.252 --> 03:42:13.753
NOT THEIR PERMANENT PLACE BUT

03:42:13.820 --> 03:42:15.689
THERE THERE IT ACCORDING TO THE

03:42:15.755 --> 03:42:17.657
DOCUMENTATION HERE. FOR THEIR

03:42:17.724 --> 03:42:21.361
THERAPEUTIC. APPOINTMENTS OR OR

03:42:21.428 --> 03:42:24.330
ENGAGEMENT AT HOW IT ALL. IS

03:42:24.397 --> 03:42:26.833
THAT CONDUCIVE TO ADDRESSING

03:42:26.900 --> 03:42:28.134
ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT IN

03:42:28.201 --> 03:42:33.506
MAY MAY HAVE. SO WE HAVE WE CDC

03:42:33.573 --> 03:42:35.008
ARE HAS UTILIZED THE

03:42:35.075 --> 03:42:38.778
THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT MODULES

03:42:38.845 --> 03:42:39.913
FOR. A NUMBER OF YEARS I DON'T

03:42:39.979 --> 03:42:41.114
KNOW HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN IN

03:42:41.181 --> 03:42:46.486
EXISTENCE AND- WE CONTINUE TO

03:42:46.553 --> 03:42:48.321
EXPLORE WITH THE PLAINTIFFS AND

03:42:48.388 --> 03:42:50.256
SPECIAL MASTER ALTERNATIVES

03:42:50.323 --> 03:42:54.227
FOR- TREATMENT. AND THEY WERE

03:42:54.294 --> 03:42:56.463
WERE USED THEM TO KEEP THE BOTH

03:42:56.529 --> 03:43:00.066
THE INMATE AND THE STAFF SAFE

03:43:00.133 --> 03:43:03.203
IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE- IT'S

03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:05.772
NOT SAFE FOR OTHER FOR OTHER

03:43:05.839 --> 03:43:08.708
ENGAGEMENTS. I UNDERSTAND THAT

03:43:08.775 --> 03:43:12.445
BUT I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME.

03:43:12.512 --> 03:43:14.914
SEE HOW ANY PROGRESS CAN BE

03:43:14.981 --> 03:43:17.317
MADE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHEN

03:43:17.383 --> 03:43:19.686
THEY'RE RECEIVING TREATMENT.

03:43:19.753 --> 03:43:21.688
AND IF IT'S IN A CAGE LIKE THAT

03:43:21.755 --> 03:43:23.389
I'VE SEEN THOSE I DON'T THINK I

03:43:23.456 --> 03:43:25.191
COULD EVEN STAND UP IN ONE LET

03:43:25.258 --> 03:43:27.761
ALONE NECESSARILY EVEN SIT IN

03:43:27.827 --> 03:43:30.130
ONE. JUST GIVEN MY SIZE SO IT'S

03:43:30.196 --> 03:43:32.065
REALLY ASTONISHING TO ME TO SEE

03:43:32.132 --> 03:43:33.166
THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS

03:43:33.233 --> 03:43:34.667
CURRENTLY BEING USED AND IS

03:43:34.734 --> 03:43:38.571
CURRENTLY A MAJOR PART OF HOW.

03:43:38.638 --> 03:43:40.907
TREATMENT AND I SORT OF EVEN

03:43:40.974 --> 03:43:42.242
HATE TO USE THE WORD GETS

03:43:42.308 --> 03:43:45.345
DELIVERED. EVEN IN A DIFFICULT

03:43:45.411 --> 03:43:47.480
CITING LACK OF PRESENCE SO I

03:43:47.547 --> 03:43:48.681
DID I THINK THIS REALLY

03:43:48.748 --> 03:43:49.749
UNDERSCORES WHAT WE'VE HEARD

03:43:49.816 --> 03:43:51.284
FROM THE GUARDS WHAT WE HEAR

03:43:51.351 --> 03:43:53.820
FROM THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE. IN

03:43:53.887 --> 03:43:56.589
CUSTODY IN OUR PRISONS AB YES

03:43:56.656 --> 03:43:57.857
THERE IS A SERIOUS MENTAL

03:43:57.924 --> 03:43:59.659
HEALTH ISSUE ACROSS SOCIETY AND

03:43:59.726 --> 03:44:00.860
THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

03:44:00.927 --> 03:44:02.662
WITH BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK

03:44:02.729 --> 03:44:04.931
AT HOW WE'RE TREATING PEOPLE IN

03:44:04.998 --> 03:44:07.767
OUR CUSTODY IN OUR CARE. IN

03:44:07.834 --> 03:44:09.235
WHAT WAS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A

03:44:09.302 --> 03:44:12.005
THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT AND IT

03:44:12.071 --> 03:44:14.274
LOOKS TO ME LIKE CITY SEE ARE

03:44:14.340 --> 03:44:15.842
BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES

03:44:15.909 --> 03:44:17.710
GIVEN UP ON THE THERAPEUTIC

03:44:17.777 --> 03:44:19.179
COMPONENTS SO I THINK THERE'S A

03:44:19.245 --> 03:44:21.514
LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE HERE

03:44:21.581 --> 03:44:22.682

03:44:22.749 --> 03:44:24.984
CULTURAL CHANGES. WITH WITHIN

03:44:25.051 --> 03:44:29.022

IS THE SYSTEM WE ARE FUNDING.

03:44:39.332 --> 03:44:40.200
AND I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN

03:44:40.266 --> 03:44:42.168
EXPECT THINGS TO CHANGE WITHIN

03:44:42.235 --> 03:44:43.970
THAT SYSTEM EVEN AS WE TRY TO

03:44:44.037 --> 03:44:44.637

03:57:10.382 --> 03:57:11.917
OUR PLACE. AND THEY DO OR

03:57:11.984 --> 03:57:12.751
MEMBERS. FEAR COULD NOT AS THE-

03:57:12.818 --> 03:57:14.320
CO. THAT THERE IN AND AS A

03:57:14.386 --> 03:57:15.621
RESULT IT'S TEARING THEM APART

ENVIRONMENT I MEAN YOU KNOW SO.

03:57:28.367 --> 03:57:29.602
AS WE LOOK AT HOW WE HAVE

03:57:29.668 --> 03:57:30.869
INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN

03:57:30.936 --> 03:57:32.738
CALIFORNIA. AND THE HUGE

03:57:32.805 --> 03:57:34.139
NUMBERS AND THE FACILITIES AND

03:57:34.206 --> 03:57:35.341
HOW THEY LOOK IN ALL THESE

03:57:35.407 --> 03:57:38.477

03:57:44.883 --> 03:57:45.551
OF NOT HOME WAS ALL THE PRISON

03:57:45.618 --> 03:57:47.419
IN CALIFORNIA. NOT AS A

03:57:47.486 --> 03:57:49.254
LEGISLATOR BUT WHEN I WAS A

03:57:49.321 --> 03:57:50.589
TWENTY TWENTY YEAR OLD SINGER I

IT BOTHERED ME THAT YOU KNOW TO

03:57:55.461 --> 03:57:56.629
THE GOAL BUT I'D GO BECAUSE

03:57:56.695 --> 03:57:58.163
THESE GUYS ARE SO HAPPY TO SEE

03:57:58.230 --> 03:58:00.733
FOLKS COME. AND GIVE THEM SOME

03:58:00.799 --> 03:58:02.568
ENTERTAINMENT DURING A AND

IT WORKED ON. I GOT TO PROVIDE

03:58:11.043 --> 03:58:11.810
LIKE TO GO BUT I WOULD GO

03:58:11.877 --> 03:58:14.546
SOMETIMES- BECAUSE IT IS A IT

03:58:14.613 --> 03:58:16.415
IS NOT A HEALTHY PLACE TO BE.

03:58:16.482 --> 03:58:18.450
AND THAT WAS YEARS AGO WHEN WE

03:58:18.517 --> 03:58:19.685
DIDN'T INCARCERATE AS MANY

03:58:19.752 --> 03:58:22.788
