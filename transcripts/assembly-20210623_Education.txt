THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR COULD MORNING MEMBERS. SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY THREE WILL ENSURE THAT THE AMERICAN LEGION AND AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SIMILAR ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO ALL STUDENTS. AS WELL AS NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON GENDER. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL FOR OTHERS CALIFORNIA'S GOAL OF PROVIDING EQUITABLE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. TO ALL STUDENTS BY REQUIRING BOTH BOYS STATE AND GIRLS STATE PROGRAMS TO OFFER. SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR CROSS CURRICULUM. SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND FACILITIES AN EQUAL NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR GIRLS TO PARTICIPATE AS THERE ARE FOR BOYS. ANY LIMITATION ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS NOMINATED PER SCHOOL SHALL APPLY TO BOTH PROGRAMS. AND ALLOW NON BINARY STUDENTS TO APPLY TO EITHER PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG HELD THAT ACCESS TO EDUCATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FOR ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR GENDER. SADLY YOUNG WOMEN PARTICIPATING CALIFORNIA GIRL STATE ARE NOT AFFORDED COMPATIBLE CIVIC EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. AS YOUNG MEN AND CALIFORNIA BOYS STATE. EVERY YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PANDEMIC. APPROXIMATE THOUSAND YOUNG MEN PARTICIPATE IN BOYS STATE AND VISIT SACRAMENTO. AT THE STATE CAPITOL DURING THE SUMMER. ON THE OTHER HAND CALIFORNIA GIRL STATE WITH THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES ERA CAP OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY PARTICIPANTS. ARE ABLE TO PARTAKE IN SOME OF THE ASPECTS OF CIVIC EDUCATION. BUT NOT HAVE BEEN NOT BEEN AFFORDED AT THE SAME ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO THEIR GOVERNMENT THAT'S A VOICE HELP. MOST NOTABLY IN COMING TO SAN CRIMINAL AND VISITOR THEIR STAY CAPITOL. ONE CANNOT DIED THE CAN CANNOT DENY THAT THE PROGRAM'S PRESENTS AND SACRAMENTO A FOURTH OPPORTUNITIES THAT STUDENTS MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE. OTHER INEQUITIES ALSO EXIST SUCH AS APPLICATION FEES REGISTRATION FEES. CAREER FAIRS AND THE LEARNING OF OUTDATED SONGS THAT FOCUS MORE ON THE PARENTS OF YOUNG WOMEN. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG WOMEN ARE OFFERED THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND SAME TYPE OF EXPOSURE TO GOVERNMENT AS YOUNG MEN. IN THE WORDS OF SALLY RIDE THE FIRST WOMAN IN SPACE YOU CANNOT BE WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE. SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG WOMEN ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED AND ARE ALSO ABLE TO VISIT THE HALLS OF POWER IN SACRAMENTO. AND THE CAPITAL IF THE YOUNG MEN PARTICIPATING BOYS STATE DO. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE AMERICAN LEGION AND AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY AND BOTH HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AFTER AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JESSICA STENDER WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES. AND SHALL BE EGGED ON A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GIRLS STATE ALUMNI. AND WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT. THERE THE BILL'S MOVED AND SECONDED LET'S GO TO YOUR FIRST WITNESS- MISS CENTER I BELIEVE STENDER CENTER. CENTER CENTER I APOLOGIZE YEAH PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING AND A CHAIR AND MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA STENDER SENIOR COUNSEL FOR WORKPLACE JUSTICE AND PUBLIC POLICY EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF SB THREE SIX THREE. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE GENDER BASED INEQUITY THAT IS PERPETUATED BY OUTDATED EXCEPTION TO PROTECT COMBINATION COEFFICIENTS USING PROHIBITION THAT OUR STATE EDUCATION CODE. IS ACCEPTABLE PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES OF THE AMERICAN LEGION AND SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION RELATED TO THE BOYS AND GIRLS THE CONFERENCE. WAS INCLUDED AMERICAN MILLER EXCEPTION ENTITLED LINE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE EXCEPTION UNDER TITLE NINE OF THE RESULT OF HE POLITICAL COMPROMISE. IT MIGHT HAVE ARGUABLY BEEN INTENDED TO EASE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE AMERICAN LEGION INTO A NEW ERA OF LEGALLY MANDATED EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS HOWEVER ANY SUCH RATIONALE DEVOID OF LEGITIMACY AND AS FAR OUTLIVED ANY PURPORTED JUSTIFICATION. THIS IS SPECIALLY TRUE WANTED RESULTED IN GENDER BASED INEQUITIES THAT ARE CONTRARY TO THE INTENT AND PURPOSE OF OUR STATE EDUCATION. CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS- WOULD SURE THAT THE PROGRAMS SUSTAINED SIMILAR PROGRAM. AS WELL AS EQUAL ACT TO GO OFFICIALS AND IT'S REALLY. EQUAL NUMBER TICKETS AND FULL ACCESS AND NON BINARY STUDENTS. THE GOAL HERE IS TO BRING THE GIRLS PROGRAM UP TO PAR WITH THE BOYS PROGRAM AND IT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH BILL. AND THEN THERE WERE MORE WOMEN AROUND THAN EVER RUNNING FOR OFFICE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOW THE WAY AND HELPING THESE PROGRAMS CREATE A PIPELINE OF YOUNG WOMEN THAT WE WANT TO RUN FOR OFFICE. ALLOWING GENDER DISCRIMINATION ESPECIALLY WHILE USING PUBLIC RESOURCES AND ENGAGING WITH OUR- STATE LEGISLATURE FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE VALUES OF OUR STATE. SB THREE SIX THREE PROVIDE A PATH TO CREATING A MUCH NEEDED CHANGE THE PROGRAM. AND ENSURE THAT OUR EDUCATION EQUITY LAW LIVES UP TO ITS PURPOSE. OF PREVENTING SEX DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES FOR THESE REASONS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I. ABOUT. THANK YOU TO THE NAY. WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SHELBY AND DAHLE I ATTENDED GIRLS STATE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND RETURNED AS A JUNIOR COUNSELOR IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHEN I FIRST ATTENDED GIRLS STATE I FOUND THE PROGRAM TO BE EMPOWERING I WAS SO EXCITED TO BE SELECTED TO REPRESENT MY SCHOOL IN SUCH A PRESTIGIOUS PROGRAM. I LOVED LEARNING ABOUT GOVERNMENT SUCH A GREAT COMMUNITY OF AMBITIOUS YOUNG WOMEN FROM ACROSS THE STATE. BUT THEN I CAME BACK FROM GROWTH STATE AND LEARNED ABOUT WHAT MY MALE COUNTERPARTS. AT BOISE STATE. NOT ONLY WAS IT A LARGER PROGRAM WITH TWO BOYS FROM MY SCHOOL ATTENDING REGULARLY COMPARED TO THE ONE ATTENDING GIRLS STATE. BUT THEY KNOW THAT THE CAPITOL VISITORS ARE REPRESENTATIVES OFFICERS AND MEDICS AFRICAN REPRESENTATIVE. THEY PARTICIPATED IN A CLEAR NIGHT COLLEGE OFFICIALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY WERE EVEN AWARDED CERTIFICATE. TRACKING RISING ARCHING BACK. NONE OF THE SAME OPPORTUNITY WERE FOR THAT. I THOUGHT LIKE WOULD. IN THE LAST FIVE WITH AND OF THEIR I'LL BE OPTION PURELY BECAUSE OF GENDER. WITHOUT EXPOSURE AND NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES THE BOYS RECEIVED. SO MANY DOORS THAT WERE OPEN TO THAT. MORE PEOPLE ARE LEFT WALKED US. I THOUGHT BACK TO INAPPROPRIATE SAMBA GROWTH ABOUT. FORTY CRAZINESS AND TALKING A GIRL STATE CORAL WALKING DOWN THE STREET. TRADITIONS OF THE PROGRAM'S OUTDATED STRUCTURE. WHEN I JUST GOT THE LOCATION ISSUE WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES EIGHT STAFF MEMBERS I WAS TOLD MANY DIFFERENT COMPETING ANSWERED THAT ALL COULD NOT BELIEVE. THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S INCONVENIENT. AND NOT THE OPERATOR. EVEN WHEN I PUT THE EFFORT IN ADAM AND HER AT THE CAPITOL TO GET CERTIFICATES FOR GIRLS SKATERS. EVER PROVIDED ME WITH THE INFORMATION YOU THAT DESPITE BEING LATE WHAT WITH MULTIPLE CHECK IN FOR ME. THIS IS A CHANGE. THE MILLIONS OF YOUNG WOMEN IN THE STATE IS THAT BETTER. I NEEDED ABOUT DEATH ON THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ARE WILL NOW GO TO ANY WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION. THE HEARING NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE'LL NOW GO TO ANY COMMITTEE MEMBER QUESTIONS ON THE BILL NOT SINGLE QUESTIONS ON THE BILL. THIS CALL. GOOD MORNING SO I ATTENDED GIRLS STATE AND BOTH OF OUR SONS ARE BOYS STATE- THEY BOTH ATTENDED AND MY FATHER IS HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE NORTH STATE AND RECRUITMENT SO WHEN I SAW SO I WAS. CONFUSED TO BE HONEST BECAUSE THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES AND THEY'VE BUILT THESE PROGRAMS OUT PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER SO THAT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE AFFILIATED THEIR NONPROFITS. AND SO WHEN WE WHEN I QUESTIONED- YOU KNOW WHAT WHY ARE WE INVOLVED IN THIS WELL SO IT'S THE RECORD I WANT TO BE CLEAR IT'S A RECRUITMENT FROM THE SCHOOLS THAT MAKES THIS. THE INVOLVEMENT OKAY. SO RECRUITMENT FOR MY FATHER INCLUDES WALKING AND HANDING HAS. SLIPPED TO THE YOU KNOW FLYERS THE PRINCIPLE TO SAY LET'S REMEMBER. THIS IS COMING UP WE NEED KIDS IT'S VERY ACTUALLY HARDER TO RECRUIT THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE AS I'M SPEAKING FOR THAT OUR STATE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO IT'S ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE TO SEND GIRLS FROM THE NORTH STATE. TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WE'RE NOT GOING TO. FORCED PROGRAMS THAT ARE NONPROFIT PROGRAMS TO RELOCATE TO A DIFFERENT CAMPUS BECAUSE THE REASON THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. THE CAPITALS BECAUSE THERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. CORRECT NO- WE HAVE LOTS OF YOUNG MEN FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE PART OF BOYS STATE THE TRAVEL UP TO THE CAPITAL RIGHT BUT THE GIRLS STATE PROGRAM IS LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THAT IT WAS SO PART OF THEIR PROGRAM IS A BUILT OUT TO ATTEND LIKE WE SEE THE BOYS STATE THAT WILL BE HERE I THINK THIS WEEK ACTUALLY. AND THEY WILL BE THROUGH THE HALLS SO WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING THE AMERICAN THE AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY TO RELOCATE THEIR CONFERENCE. TO SACRAMENTO THEY DON'T HAVE TO BUT IF THEY DON'T THEN THE BOYS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SACRAMENTO. THIS IS JUST STRICTLY ABOUT EQUITY AND MAKING SURE THAT BOTH PROGRAMS. OFFER THE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PROGRAMS. THAT YOU KNOW YOU THINK ABOUT IT SO IF THEY HAVE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM YES. WE WORK WITH THE AUXILIARY THAT IS OPPOSITION. THEY ARE IN SUPPORT NOW- IT CAN YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT SO AS A PART OF THE STARTED FOR ME. ASSEMBLY WOMAN WHEN I WOULD SEE THE THOUSANDS OF BOYS ARE HUNDREDS OF BOYS COMING TO BOISE STATE UP HERE AND I SAID WHY DON'T THE GIRLS ALLOWED ONE OF THE GIRLS HERE. AND I DON'T KNOW THE GIRLS AREN'T ALLOWED TO COME NICE WHAT SEEMS WRONG. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT FEMALE LEGISLATORS. WHICH IS THE MOST WE HAVE HAD IN HISTORY OUT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY. WE NEED MORE WOMEN COMING SO THEY CAN SEE THAT THEY CAN BE IN THE- ASSEMBLY THAT THEY CAN BE IN THE SENATE. SO YES THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM AND LIKE I SAID THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE TAKEN HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SO I AGREE THAT WE NEED EQUITY AND- I'M- A WOMAN. TO A POSITION. BUT- I THINK OR ME. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S- WE CAN JUST. MAYBE NOT RECRUITING MORE OUT OF THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE ASKING A NONPROFIT WHO'S BEEN DOING THIS SUCCESSFULLY FOR DECADES AND YES OR NEEDS TO BE IMPROVEMENTS I AGREE. BUT THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT MONEY THERE ARE IN THESE PROGRAMS THERE'D WE DON'T FIND THIS. AND A GIRL SAY IS JUST GROSSLY UNDER FUNDED AND THAT'S JUST COMING OUT OF THE COMMUNITIES. AND THE NONPROFIT ITSELF SO. WHICH WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER HERE OTHER THAN IF WE WANT TO GET INVOLVED OURSELVES AND HELP FUND THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH THEY DO. AND THEN OUR STATE. SO THANK YOU. FOR THAT AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO DEFINE SUCCESS. IF THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. THE IN MY OPINION I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THESE YOUNG WOMEN HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SEE THEIR GOVERNMENT. ACTION THEY'RE SINGING SONGS THE ARE VERY HONESTLY VERY DEMEANING. AND SO I. THAT MAYBE THAT SUCCESS WAS IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES. BUT WE HAVE TO CHANGE AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE TO GET BETTER AND THIS BILL IS JUST ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT FOR THE GIRLS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG MAN. GOOD MR LINK. IT IS TOO LATE. I SCITECH DAUGHTER FOR BRING US FOR IT I ALSO KNEW THE SIMILAR THING WHEN I WAS STAFF AND I WOULD SET MY BOSSES BIGGER VOICE STATE AND I WOULD ASK OF ONE OF THE GIRLS COMING OFF AND IF THEY DON'T COME UP AS A LOT. OF SOMETHING TO MAYBE TO ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUES POINT TO IS I KNOW IN MY NOTES THAT GIRL STATE HAS 50% FEWER APPLICANTS AND THEY ALSO PAY A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE WELL BOYS STATE THEY'LL PAY ANYTHING AND IT'S DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE SO THERE IS AN UNFAIRNESS THERE TO THAT POINT YET SO HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE FUNDING ISSUE BY HAVING A CRUEL PAY STRUCTURES LAW OF COURSE YOU KNOW. THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A LOT FOR YOUNG PERSON BUT HOPEFULLY A FEW MORE EQUITABLY DISPERSED THAT WAY I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHAT- EQUITY MEASURE TO BRING FEMALE STUDENTS UP HERE AS WELL AS WELLS AND I THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING NON BINARY SINCE AS WELL AND THIS IS A RELEASE TO MODERNIZE OUR PROGRAM MAKE SURE IT. AND SHOW YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THE HALLS OF POWER NOT JUST FOR THAT ANYMORE SO I THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK I WHAT YOU JUST HEARD HIM SAY MR ALWAYS GONNA HELP YOU GET ONEY IN. THE BUDGET NEXT YEAR FOR GIRLS STATE. BUT I HEARD. THIS COURT SILVA. GOOD MORNING TO HIM AND SENATOR YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL YOU KNOW I THINK THIS BILL. THE CIVICALLY TALKS ABOUT. GIRLS AND BOYS STATE BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS MEN OR WOMEN RELATED TO NON PROFITS AND- WE'VE SEEN. RISE TO THE STATE LEVEL ACTIONS BY THE LEGISLATIVE BODY RELATED TO BOYS AND GIRL SCOUTS RELATED TO EVEN FOUR H. PROGRAMS THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE- IT MANY TIMES AND THEIR EDUCATION UMBRELLA YOU HAVE THESE VERY CLOSE PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR. QUITE A LONG TIME I KNOW THAT TO MYSELF IN THE CHAIR ACTUALLY ONE OUT TO SEE SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS AT OUR HIGH SCHOOL WITH OUR AGRICULTURE CLUBS AND AGAIN PUBLIC PRIVATE PROGRAMS SO SOMETIMES WE INTERVENE. IN WAYS TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM SOMETIMES WE INNER VISION AND BUDGET ASKED TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS. BUT I WOULD SAY. GROWING UP IN FULLER TEN A COMING FROM US OF. HIGHER ED I WAS THE FOR IN MY FOR. NONE OF THE ANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT I MEANT WERE RE OF A FOR MANY OF OUR UNDER COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OFTEN THESE PROGRAMS ARE GENERATIONAL IN THE SENSE THAT. WHETHER IT'S NATIONAL CHARITY LEAGUE WEATHER'S BOYS AND GIRLS STATE THAT IT'S THE FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN INVOLVED AND THEN THEY OF COURSE INVOLVED THEIR OWN FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND SOMETIMES THOSE ARE DOOR DOORS ARE SHUT TO A VERY. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BECAUSE NOBODY IN THEIR FAMILIES EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN FOUR H. OUR BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OR A STATE AND I KNOW- PARTICULARLY AT THE SCHOOLS WERE THE INVITATIONS ARE MADE TO WHETHER IT'S THE- GIRL OR THE YOUNG BOY A LOT OF TIMES THAT THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE PRINCIPAL. OFFICE OR AT THE COUNSELOR OFFICE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY RECOMMEND- THROUGH THE NONPROFIT AND AGAIN. YOU CAN THERE IS A PATTERN OF THE SAME FAMILIES BEING INVITED SO I SUPPORT THIS BUT I DO THINK AS WE EVOLVE. THESE MEASURES OF EQUITY. NOT TO SAY EVERY BOY AND GIRL IN ANY CLASS WOULD HAVE THE INTEREST OR EVEN THE DESIRE TO JOIN BUT MANY TIMES EVEN AT ITS BEST THEIR VERY SMALL GROUPS OF THE SAME INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ASTON DO THESE PROGRAMS SO. I APPRECIATE THIS AND WANT TO SEE. MY DESIRE TO IS TO SEE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE NOT TO EXCLUDE EXCLUDE ONE GROUP BUT TO INCLUDE MORE SO THANK YOU AND I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL. MISTER BENNETT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IT IS SOME RESPONSIBILITY ON THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION TO LOOK AT THEIR ORGANIZATION AND IF. SO I WOULD SAY THE BOYS STATE. HAVE SOME. TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE IS EQUAL ACCESS TO THE FEMALES IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR IF THEY'RE GOING TO USE- PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS A RECRUITMENT TOOL AND THAT JUST AS A- AS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM- I APPRECIATE TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR IF NOT THE SAME RESOURCES AND HOW THEY DO IT BUT THAT'S- THAT'S- I THINK THE BURDEN OF ANYBODY PROVIDING A PROGRAM LIKE THIS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS EQUAL ACCESS THANK YOU.

CLOSE- YOU MAY CLOSE YOUR EYES ARE GOING TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD I THOUGHT IT WAS RELATIVELY SIMPLE THAT WE JUST WANTED EQUITY FOR GIRLS IN THIS PROGRAM AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED AT HOW MUCH OPPOSITION WE GOT FROM THE AMERICAN LEGION- THEY EVER MOVE THEIR OPPOSITION BUT ADDITIONALLY. I HAD BOYS WHO GRADUATED VOICE STATE FROM ALL OVER THE STATE CALLING ME TELLING ME THAT I WAS GOING TO BE RUINING THE VOICE STATE PROGRAM BY MAKING SURE THAT IT WAS EQUITABLE FOR GIRLS AND IT WAS JUST REALLY SHOCKING TO ME HOW INCREDIBLY SEXIST IT WAS AND YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND COACHED AMERICAN LEGION FOR MANY MANY YEARS BASEBALL- WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH AMERICAN LEGION FOR MANY YEARS. SO YOU KNOW AS I SAID TO THEM THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE AMERICAN LEGION AND INTEGRATING THEM THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOUNG WOMEN HAVE THE SAME EQUITY IN- AS THE BOYS STILL SO I'M GLAD THAT WE GOT TO A POSITION WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW SHOCKING IT WAS IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT MY STAFF HEARD.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'LL BE BRIEF- WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE SEE ON TV AND PEOPLE STORMING THE CAPITOL WERNICK SHIRT THAT SAYS CAMP AUSCHWITZ ON IT AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT AUSCHWITZ IS WE KNOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM- WHEN. THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IS FINALLY RECOGNIZING AND YOUNG PEOPLE GROWING UP IN THE HEART OF THE ARMENIAN DESPERATE. NO CONTEXT FOR THEIR HISTORY OR WAY TO SHARE THAT THAT HISTORY WITH- WITH THEIR FELLOW CLASSMATES AND FEEL AT HOME IN THEIR COMMUNITY WE HAVE A PROBLEM. I THINK THERE'S- THERE'S OF THEIR STRONG FOUNDATIONS IN OUR EDUCATION CODE IN IN OUR IN OUR PRACTICES RIGHT NOW FOR TEACHING ABOUT GENOCIDE FOR TEACHING ABOUT HISTORY IT'S BUILT INTO THE MODEL CURRICULA BUT WHEN CRISES HAPPEN AT SCHOOLS WERE LOOKING TO GIVE TOOLS TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TO DEAL WITH ACTS OF HATE. WITH HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND HOPEFULLY THIS BILL PROVIDES SOME SOME TOOLS- TO EMPOWER FOLKS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ARE GETTING TEACHERS EXPERTISE IN THIS COMMISSION OR ENVISIONING I THINK WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR THE PEOPLE OF EXPERIENCE TEACHING ABOUT THE GENOCIDE. IT'S INCREDIBLY DIVERSE COALITION AN IMPORTANT TIME TO REALIZE WHERE WE COME FROM OR WHAT OUR HISTORY IS AND HOW MUCH IMPACT IT HAS ESPECIALLY- IN A TIME OF RACIAL UPHEAVAL WHEN YOU HAVE YOU KNOW YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN THE TEN FREE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS HIGHWAY AND YOU'RE WONDERING. WHAT WHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WHEN COLUMBUS SAILED THE OCEAN BLUE- WE NEED TO KNOW OUR HISTORIES OF GENOCIDE IN THIS COUNTRY AND- WITHOUT IT WILL BE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WELCOME- THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION SPONSORSHIP AND LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE WITH US HERE TO TESTIFY HOPE WE DIDN'T- RUSSIAN TOO MUCH BUT- THANK YOU.

OF THIS BILL AND ASK THE MEMBERS FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS YOU HEARD SENATOR TURN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- THE SENATOR HAS OUTLINED HIS BILL ADDRESS MANY ASPECTS OF GENOCIDE- ARE YOU GOING TO TEACH ME ABOUT THEM. AND OF COURSE THE IMPORTANCE OF TEACHING ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HOLOCAUST WE'VE SEEN- A RISE IN ACTS OF HATE- THAT AFFECTED MANY- INCLUDING IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY POLICING HATE AND IN MANY WAYS AND THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT THERE IS INTERCONNECTION. FOR MANY GROUPS IN THAT WE CAN NEVER FORGET ANY GENOCIDE AS IT THAT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO CREEP UP AGAIN AND SO- FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED. BEFORE I URGE YOUR- FOLKS THAT CALIFORNIA PROCLIVITY CATIONS IS NOT. WASTE TO HELP SUPPORT THE STATION OF THIS BILL AND HAS BEEN WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE RESOURCES DO YOU DO WHAT WE CALL EDUCATION. CULTURE HATE. IT TO COUNTER THE HEAT THAT OFTEN CAN MANIFEST IN ACTS OF GENOCIDE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SUPERINTEND OVER THE NEXT WITNESS- WHICH IS A MISTER CLIFF BURKE. YOU SUPPORT. THANK YOU I MISTER CHAIR CLIFF HERE BEHALF OF FIRST THE JEWISH PUBLIC. CAN OF K. WE ARE IN STRONG. OF THIS LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL ON GENOCIDE AND THE HOLOCAUST- DISCOUNTS WILL PROVIDE ENHANCED RESOURCES FOR TEACHER TRAINING AND IMPROVE BEST PRACTICES TO BE UTILIZED IN THE CLASSROOM. TO REMEDY RECENT RISE IN ANTI SEMITISM HOLOCAUST DENIAL AND OTHER ACTS OF HATRED. THE FACT IS THE LARGEST SINGLE STATE COALITION OF JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS IN THE NATION REPRESENTING JEWISH COMMUNITIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- UNFORTUNATELY EXISTING LAW DOES NOT EXPLICITLY REQUIRE AGE APPROPRIATE INSTRUCTION FOCUSED ON HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE EDUCATION. INSTEAD THESE TOPICS ARE GENERALLY COVERED IN THE GREATER CONTEXT OF WAR WAR TO THESE CAN RESULT IN ONLY A SUPERFICIAL OVERVIEW BEING PRESENTED TO STUDENTS WHICH IN TURN MINIMIZES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HOLOCAUST. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN STUDY FOUND THAT 41% OF AMERICANS AND IDENTIFY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OX WHAT'S- THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT THE COLLECTIVE MEMORY OF THE HOLOCAUST. AND THE SYSTEMATIC EXTERMINATION OF MILLIONS IS FADING THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ARE STARK AND READILY DEMONSTRATED BY THE RISE IN ANTI SEMITIC SPEECH. AND HATE CRIMES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. SB SIX NINE THREE WILL CONFRONT THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING AGE APPROPRIATE HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE EDUCATION. TO STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND WILL PROVIDE TEACHERS WITH EXPERT APPROVED AGE APPROPRIATE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND RESOURCES TO EDUCATE ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST THE HARMS OF RACISM. AND BIGOTRY- ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER AND MUSEUM OF TALL HOLOCAUST AND WOULD SAY IN THEIR BEHALF THE HOLOCAUST WAS THE WATERSHED EVENT OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. AND YET THE MEMORY OF THIS OBSCENITY FADES TOGETHER WITH THE COURAGEOUS SURVIVORS- IT'S ASTOUNDING THE INTERNS OF SO MANY AMERICANS TODAY AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR OF THE HISTORY OF THE HOLOCAUST IN EVENTS. THAT HAPPENED SURROUNDING IT. THE INCREASE RISE IN ANTI SEMITISM THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IN ACTS OF VIOLENCE HARASSMENT VANDALISM ASSAULTS IN INTERNET COMMENTS. OF ANY ANTI SEMITIC IN NATURE DR DRIVE HOME THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION ON BEHALF OF G. PACK IN THE SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER. URGES YOUR AYE VOTE IN. STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I APOLOGIZE ANY OPPOSITION SEEING OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I'LL JUST MAKE A QUICK COMMENT MISTER BIRD BROUGHT UP ACTUALLY.

BECAUSE IT HELPS ME- IT'S MUCH QUICKER RIGHT I GO TO WEBSITE THERE'S VIDEO THERE- IN THIS INSTANCE ON THINGS THAT ARE PRETTY GRAPHIC BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. REMOVE THOSE PICTURES FROM YOUR MEMORY AND THAT'S WHAT. AND THAT'S EVIDENCE NO ONE CAN DENY THAT SOME MAY BUT THEY SHOULDN'T RIGHT WE KNOW THIS WE KNOW THIS EVER IN RECENT HISTORY BUT AT THE SAME TIME I APPRECIATE THE FOCUS AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER.

THE BEST EDUCATION pKNOW MISTER SO. L. FAMOUS QUOTE THAT WE MANY OF HER THOSE WHO FORGET THE PAST ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT. I THINK WE'RE LIVING IN THAT TIME RIGHT NOW- SADLY AND HORRIFICALLY WE ARE USING WHAT HAS HAPPENED. DURING THE HOLOCAUST PERIOD AS A SYMBOL OF SOME OF TODAY'S FIGHTS WE'VE SEEN THAT RELATED TO VACCINATIONS IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAD- NOT JUST A FEW BUT MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE TO THE ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT AND ED. BOARD WEARING. YELLOW STAR ACQUAINTING THAT STAR WITH VACCINE. A POTENTIAL PASSPORTS AND OF THE LAST YEAR I'VE BEEN READING SEVERAL NOVELS ON HISTORICAL FICTION RELATED TO THE CALL HOLOCAUST AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING TO ME THAT NOT THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD GO TO A BOARD AND TALK ABOUT POTENTIAL VACCINE PASSPORTS BUT THAT THEY WOULD USE THE STAR. AS SOMEHOW THERE'S EVEN AN IOTA OF SIMILAR. ABUSES KNOWING THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS. OF JEWS THAT WERE KILLED KNOWING- THE HORRIFIC CONDITIONS THEY DIED UNDER AND IF THIS BILL CAN DO NO MORE NOTHING MORE THAN UP PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REMEMBER TO RE LEARN TO UNDERSTAND.

WAYS FIRST IT HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE PREDICTIVE VALIDITY WE DO NOT KNOW THAT THE TEACHER WHO PASSES THE RICA IS A BETTER. TEACHER THAN SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT. TEACHING SUCH THAT. HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PROVE TEACHER EFFECTIVENESS. SECOND THERE WE COULD DOES NOT ALIGN WITH CURRENT STATED OFTEN STANDARDS OR FRAMEWORKS SUCH AS OUR STATE ADOPTED THE L. A. E. L. B. FRAMEWORK WHICH EMPHASIZES THE FIVE BEANS OF MEANING MAKING LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT AFFECTED EXPRESSION CONTENT KNOWLEDGE AND FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS. EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION INCLUDING ALL FIVE TEAM SUPPORTS THE READING SUCCESS OF ALL STUDENTS AND IS A SPECIALLY CRITICAL FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS WE NEED TEACHERS TO WITH THE MOST UP TO DATE- GAJI TO EFFECTIVELY TEACH ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN STREET.

SOMETIMES THEY WOULD PASS ONE PARK AND THAT NOT ANOTHER ONLY TO RETAKE THE ENTIRE EXAM AGAIN DATA INDICATES THE RVCA IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR TEACHERS TO HAVE ENGLISH AS THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE SH THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PASSING CAN BE DRAMATIC IF THEY AREN'T ABLE TO PASS THE EXAM AND IF THEY'VE EXHAUSTED THEIR PERMIT OPTION. PROVISIONAL INTERN PERMITS ARE SHORT TERM STOCK PERMITTED OR EVEN THEIR INTERN CREDENTIALING OP OPTION THEY CANNOT TO BE HIRED BY THE DISTRICT AS A FULL TIME TEACHER THE TEACHERS MAY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR ENTIRE TEACHER PREP PROGRAMS PASSING THE GPA AND RECOMMENDED BY THE PROGRAM WHERE THEY WILL PREPARE TO BE AN EFFECTIVE EDUCATOR ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO TEACH DUE TO AN OUTDATED. EXAM BY USING HEPA SETTING THE TEACHER IS THEN IN A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ALLOWING FOR AN AUTHENTIC ASSESSMENT FOR THE MORE TEACHERS TO PAST WEEKEND DO NOT PRODUCE HIGHER STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND THOSE WHO FAIL BY CONTRAST SCORES OF THE TEACHER PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT LIKE THE AT G. P. H. HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY PROTECT. TEACHERS% AFFECTED THAT THE TEACHING READING EXTENDING THE FLEXIBILITY SINCE ONE MORE ACTION THE LEGISLATION CAN TAKE TO CONTINUE TO TEAR DOWN BARRIERS TO ENTER INTO THE TEACHING PROFESSION AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROSPECTIVE EDUCATORS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ATTAINING. FULL CERTIFICATION FOR THESE REASONS LOS ANGELES UNIFIED URGES YOUR I DOUBT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I HAVE ONE WITNESS IN A IN OPPOSITION. MAJORIS PORTER I BELIEVE. YEAH YES HELLO MY NAME IS WOULD LIKE TO ORDER AND I AM. I HAVE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA. FOR PARENTS CHILDREN ADVOCACY NORTH CAPITA BUT WE ARE AN ALL VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY UP PROPOSED- THE RICO LAST THE LEGISLATION SB SIX FOURTEEN LAST YEAR BOB BUT OUR OPPOSITION IS REALLY INTENDED TO BE VERY COLLABORATIVE. IN WORKING WITH SENATOR RUBIO'S OFFICE TO DEVELOP A CURRICULUM READING CURRICULUM THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP OUR STUDENTS. AND I SEE THAT AFTER OUR CLOUT OPPOSITION LAST YEAR THERE WERE SOME REALLY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN TERMS OF NOT ELIMINATING THE LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF THAT- SCIENTIFIC BASED READING AND ACTUALLY IT ADDS IT RESULTED IN A REALLY POSITIVE RESULTS IN TERMS. OF ADOPTING. TH DYSLEXIA GUIDELINE OF WHAT SO WE ARE NOT. OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT WE OPPOSED IT ONLY IN A COLLABORATIVE. SO THAT OUR CHILDREN END UP WITH A REALLY- BENEFICIAL BILL THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP THEM. OUR BIGGEST ISSUE RIGHT NOW I MEAN BUT SOME OF THE- BIGGER ISSUE BUT WE DON'T WE DO NOT OPPOSE BECAUSE OF THE FACT. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES AND WE HAD THE BILL DOES MOVE TOWARDS A SCIENTIFIC BASED READING SO WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW ARGUING AGAINST THAT. I THINK THE BIGGEST ISSUE RIGHT NOW REALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING I AM AN AFRICAN. I'M AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO ALSO IS OF AMERICAN INDIAN AND LATINO THE FACT. I'M JOE I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE TEACHERS OF COLOR NOT BEING IN THE PAST BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE OF THE RECAP I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY BE ABLE TO PASS A TEST BATCH HAS READING CURRICULA. YEAH AND I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD YOUR PERFORMANCE TEST WOULD BE THE BEST AT MY COLLEAGUES AND I ACTUALLY FIVE LOOK AT THOSE CATS AND WE WEREN'T. ABLE TO GET SOMETHING. SO I WE CAN TO OPPOSE IT- BECAUSE RISE.RIGHT WE ARE OPPOSING THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT- ELIMINATE THE TAKING OF THE BEACON CAST AND WE ARE OPPOSE THE GPAS ARE BECAUSE YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE EFFECTIVE IN DEMONSTRATING THE ABILITY TO TEACH.
