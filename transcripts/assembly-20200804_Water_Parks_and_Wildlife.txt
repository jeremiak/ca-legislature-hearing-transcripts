I'M OPENED UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE HAVE SOME REMEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU I'M SENATOR STERN I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SMALLER TO A LOGICAL- ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR DISTRICTS AND NEAR MINE THEY HAVE RAISED CONCERNS THAT SMALLER SIZES WOULD BE SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THIS BILL AND WHAT CAUSES THEM TO CLOSE WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO ELABORATE ON HOW YOU PLAN TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND YOU WILL HAVE ALREADY HAD A CONVERSATION- WITH SEVERAL COLLEAGUES THAT I'M REFERRING TO AND- THE INFORMATION WAS NOT CLEAR IF YOU CAN ELABORATE I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. SO WELL. THE OFFICE IT'S FOR THE AUTHOR WELL THIS SISTER GETS IN THE QUEUE WILL HAVE THE PRESENTER UP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE- POINTS THAT YOU VOICE. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU. IF YOU CAN ANSWER THEM IF NOT I WILL WAIT FOR I BELIEVE MISTER- COMING TO IS HOPEFULLY A STILL ON THEIR AVAILABLE. THE AUTHORS AVAILABLE CALL. THE OTTERS AVAILABLE THAT PLEASE CLOSE YOUR. YEAH I'M I'M SORRY DID YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND TO A PARTICULAR QUESTION OR TO GIVE FINAL STATE HERE. SENATOR STERN THIS IS SOMEONE NUMBER REVIEW I JUST WANTED TO- ASK I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY A COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SMALLER TO A LOGICAL ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR DISTRICTS AND YOUR MIND THEY HAVE RAISED CONCERNS AND OTHERS WHOSE WHAT BE SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THIS BILL AND WHAT CARDS CLOSE. TO BE ABLE TO LAND ON YOUR MANAGER THESE. COME WHAT YOU ALREADY THEIR ISSUES NOT ADDRESS YES THANK YOU FOR MEMBER FOR THAT AND IT FOR THAT NEEDING CLEAR THERE- SO. WE HAVE TALKED TO SOME SMALLER ZOOS WHO EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT PERHAPS- BECAUSE OF THE BILL'S PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF ANIMALS OF WILDLIFE THAT HAVE POTENTIAL RISK OF DO NOT A TRANSMISSION. THAT THAT WOULD BE INTERPRETED TO BROADLY BASED INHIBIT THEM FROM IMPORTING SAY NEW SPECIES- TO SOUTH AFRICAN DEAR DIE WE HEARD ABOUT- IN IT IN A TWO AND A SMALL DO AND THEY WILL BE IMPORTANT TO MORE- SOUTH AMERICAN WILD DEER INTO THEIR PARK. KEEP THAT ATTRACTION GOING WHAT WE WHAT WE SAID IS THAT- WE HAVE. WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO OF PUT ON OUT OR PLAY BAN ON THAT ON HOW. WHILE BEING A BUT THAT WE DO. FOR ALL SPECIES A RIGOROUS- A RIGOROUS FILTER FOR ANY POTENTIAL DO NOT A TRANSMISSION RATES SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO HONE IN ON THE LANGUAGE IF YOU LOOK AT. I'M A POINT TO THE RIGHT SECTION THE BILL HERE BUT IF THE SECTION ABOUT- HOW A NOVEL BY RISK IS. IS DEFINED AND ALSO HOW THAT THAT THE DFW WITH THE AUTHORITY IS IMPOSED WE STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- POTENTIALLY SICK- HIGH RISK ANIMALS OF ANY KIND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE MAY COME FROM MAYBE AB IN. MAMMALIAN COULD BE REPTILIAN WE'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT BROAD THERE BECAUSE WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT BRINGING IN. A NEW VIRUS EVER. THAT CAN'T HAPPEN SO WE WERE HOPING THAT THE SMALL THIS CONCERTED STICK WITH THAT ON THAT FILTER BUT KNOW THAT THERE'S NO INTENT IN THIS LEGISLATION TO CUT OFF- TING TRADE. IT IN SORT OF ANY. WAY HERE BUT I HOPE THAT THEY ALSO YOU KNOW THEY MAYFACE PERMITTING CHALLENGES THEMSELVES BY THE WAY IN TERMS OF. IMPORTING THOSE THOSE FEW ANIMAL THAT THEY NEED HEY RICK THE SUPPLY. BUT THE BILL DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THOSE REGULATIONS AT ALL SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A DISTINCT TENSIONS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WHAT. AND ALL THE- BUT I. DECIDED TO TRY TO READ ALL OF THAT HERE IN THE LATEST SO. THAT THAT'S MY TAKE ON THE MATTER I I'M HAPPY TO CHILL DOWN TRENT PULL UP THE RIGHT PART OF THE BILL HERE TO OF THAT HELPS. YES IF I MAY RESPOND THANK YOU. SENATOR STERN HOWEVER I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS NOW FOR FORTY YEARS AND YOU KNOW OUR INTENTIONS- IF NOT WRITTEN IN THE BILL. CAN BE INTERPRETED BY ANY DEPARTMENT AS THEY SEE FIT AND SO IF THERE IS NO SPECIFIC. YOU KNOW. OUTLINE OR- REFERENCE TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP BILL SMALL WHOSE BAND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU YOU KNOW THAT VERY WELL. AND SO I'M LOOKING YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND I WOULD POINT YOU TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. COULD BE HELPFUL GUIDE IF YOU PUT TO I THINK IT'S THE SECOND THE LAST PAGE IT LESTAT THE FOUR CORE AREAS AMENDMENT TAKEN IN THE LEGISLATION- SUBSTANTIAL PORTION WHICH WERE DESIGNED TO ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT A HAVING A VAGUE DEFINITION. OVERLY BROAD CRITERIA THE KIND OF WOULD MAKE MY WORDS HOLLOW WHEN I SAY MY INTENT NOT TO. WITH THEY'RE DOING ON A DAY. SO THAT I MEAN DID YOU GIVE YOU LIPS THE I CAN THE COMMITTEE DID A REGULAR JOB ON THAT POINT AND I I'M I'M HAPPY TO TALK THREE EVEN IF THERE'S TESTIMONY OR ANYONE AROUND WHO HAS THAT WHO REPRESENTS A SMALL THESE HOW THEY HOW THEY VIEW THE COMMITTEE AMENDS BUT OUR SAID DID THEY WENT A LONG WAYS TO FURTHER REFINING AND ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS WERE THEY EVER. IF THEY'LL BE ENTIRE WE NOT I DON'T KNOW I CAN EXPECT BUT THAT WOULD. I THINK YOU ARE HUNDRED AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IF WERE SOME FOR COME. ON THAT I DON'T WANT THE AND UNINTENDED ONCE TO BE TO SOME OF THE FACILITY IN BILLS. I AND MY SEC QUESTION IS HOW IS THIS COVERT RELATED- SCIENCE HAS INDICATED THAT COLD IT WAS TRANSMITTED BY HUMANS TO. ANIMALS AT I SEE THE COURT IN BETWEEN THE COVERT RELATED WE WERE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW TO. TO LOOK AT CODE RELATED- BILLS DON'T SEE THE CORRELATION TO. FURTHER ELABORATE ON. OF COURSE AND I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT AT THE TOP I APPRECIATE. THE FACT THAT WE'VE TAKEN THIS MUCH TIME OUT OF YOUR DAY IN AND IN A TOTAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. IS ALREADY AN INDULGENT REQUIRES AN EXPLANATION I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT UP AND I AGREE WE SHOULD BE- HI SCRUTINIZED FOR EVERY SINGLE BILL WE PUT BEFORE YOU AND PULL AWAY FROM- THE REST THIS CRATE. TWO THINGS ONE IS I THINK THE SIGN COMPLETELY SETTLED ON THE ORIGINS OF THE VIRUS I KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN THE ANIMAL TRANSMISSION I KNOW THERE'S STILL SOME ONGOING RESEARCH THE IN TERMS OF- HOW LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT- THAT PAYING BILLION OR OTHER- OTHER SORT OF SHE'S TRANSMISSION OF THESE KIND OF NOVEL OF I REPEAT THE NOVEL INFLUENZA VIRUSES SO. I DON'T THINK IT'S- ANYTHING IT GENERAL AS WE SEE THROUGH. AB INFLUENZA A NUMBER OF THESE MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH DO NOT A TRANSMISSION IS A MAJOR RISK IT'S BEEN CITED BY WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION YOU SEE I MEAN THIS IS NOT. SOMETHING THAT- WE SORT OF CRAFTED OURSELVES TO JUSTIFY- OF A PUSH HERE ON THAT ON THAT LIVE ANIMAL PIECE OF IT THAT WILDLIFE IMPORTATION DO NOT A TRADE MISSION. AS FAR AS THE TROPHY HUNTING PIECE OF THIS GOES IF YOU WANT TO CALL THAT THE- IN SUMMARY THE TROPHY HUNTING P. THIS EXTINCTION EVENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO IS NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR COPAYS- WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO LOSE OUR APEX SPECIES AND- MATT. THEM COLLAPSE IN PARALLEL TO THIS KOBE CRISIS SO I DON'T THINK THAT IN ANY WAY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT THE PANDEMIC AND IN FACT YOU KNOW. WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT YOU BATTLES OF THE SAME TIME AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR. NO NO. OUR TOOLS AND SAY WE'VE GOT A BECAUSE ON MAGIC EVENT I THINK WE'VE GOT AT LEAST PUT THEM BUILDING PLACE GET IT ENFORCEMENT ARCHITECTURE UP AND KEEP MOVING SO THAT'S MY ARGUMENT I APPRECIATE THE YOU'VE GOT A LOT ELSE GOING ON SO AM I APOLOGIZE FOR. TODAY TO PASS ISSUE FOR ME. THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS ACTUALLY. SOLD SOLD TO YOUR POINT ABOUT- THE TRANSMISSION WERE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TRACING PEOPLE. WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH COAL BID AND HOW ARE YOU PROPOSING TO TRACE ANY DOES YOUR OWN VIRUS. I FROM ANIMAL TO ANIMAL I UNDERSTAND THE OVERALL GOAL HOWEVER WE DIDN'T FINDING COALBED- WHEN WE WERE YOU KNOW WHEN IT OF ORIGINATED SO HOW ARE WE PROPOSING THAT. THESE ANIMALS ARE GOING TO BE. I DO YOU'RE GONNA FIND IS DISEASES ON ANIMAL THAN SOME OF THE- HEAD OF IT BEFORE IT IT HURTS PEOPLE. AND THAT SOME OF OUR EXPERTS MAY- IT WILL HAVE SOME FURTHER LIKE MORE DETAIL WHICH UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING SOME OF THE RESEARCH BUT I KNOW IT AT LEAST. WITHIN OUR UC SYSTEM IN SOME OF OUR MAJOR AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES AS WELL. AND DISEASE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION IS A- BIG ARE IN BE EFFORT THAT ONGOING THERE'S- BACK LABORATORY THERE ARE VARIOUS PASSED LABORATORIES- THERE'S ALL KINDS. OF ONGOING RESEARCH WE'RE DOING THE STATE TO TRY TO GET AHEAD OF WHAT MIGHT BE A NEW FIRE I KNOW IT THE AVIAN INFLUENZA DIFFERENCES WERE STUDY WITH THE UC SYSTEM IN THE SEA IS USED. SO IN THEORY WE'D WE'D BE ABLE TO SPOT PLEASE REGISTER EARLY AND DO A LOT BETTER JOB OF. MITIGATING OF ALL OUT. I WE SHARE THE GOAL WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE AG. COMMUNITY TO SLICE DOCTOR AT RISK FROM THESE KIND OUTBREAKS AS WELL SO I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY BIG ARCHITECTURE IN THE STATE BUT- CAN I PROMISE YOU IT'LL BE. PERFECT IN WILL BE ABLE TO BLOCK EVERYTHING NO NO I WOULDN'T SAY THAT I THINK JUST TRYING TO PUT MORE TOOLS AND TOOL KIT. THANK YOU BYE YOU JUST BROUGHT UP ANOTHER CONCERN I READ THROUGH THE BILL AND PART OF THE LANGUAGE. ABOUT OUR UNIVERSITIES HAVING TO APPLY FOR PERMITS- IN ORDER TO DO WE- SOLD. FAYE I AREA KAPALI POMONA DOES NOT I HAVE THEM IN. TWO TWO APPLY SO THEN THE RESEARCH IS NOT GOING TO BE THEM. TO THE THEY HAVE APPLIED PAY FOR THE- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS RESEARCH SERVICE REQUEST RESEARCHER TALKING ABOUT IS GOING TO BE LIMITED. TO THOSE BOB ACTUALLY APPLYING FOR IT AND IF. YOU BEING A IF I HAVE OTHER. MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO RESEARCH BY MIGHT NOT BE ON THE TOP OF THE LIST SPECIAL YOU ARE LOOKING ME THROUGH HER BOTH TO ME. CAN MEET. FOUND ON. SHE. IF THE VERY STRONG. AND I WOULD SAY LET'S LET'S TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE DON'T- BIAS OR HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE CRITICAL RESEARCH OPERATIONS I'M I'M OPEN TO LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW FINANCIAL CAPACITY I'M I'M NOT I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK OF MY TOES HERE A LITTLE BIT BUT SOME WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WASN'T A DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT. ON ANY UNIVERSITY THAT COULDN'T FOR SOME REASON DEAL WITH THE- PERMITTING COST I DON'T KNOW. THE DEPARTMENT ON THE LINE- PRESIDENT BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO I TERMS THE CALL COSTS ISSUE. I THINK IT'S A VERY FAIR POINT FAMILY MEMBER. THANK YOU THAT THE HAS BEEN INCOMING PHONE UP THAT YOU'RE WITNESSES IF I'M I BELIEVE I'M ON ME THAT I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. UNDER EXISTING LAW- UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS. AS A WHOLE ARE EXEMPTED FROM MOST PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THIS BILL. THE ONLY CHANGE TO THAT WOULD BE ONE PROVISION REQUIRES A LEFT A VERY VERY SMALL LIST OF THE MOST DANGEROUS. THE ONES THAT ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE MOST- LIKELY TO BE OF CONCERN THOSE DON'T GET ADDED TO THE LEFT. AND THERE IT'S BEEN AN EXEMPTION. TO ALLOW PERMITS. FOR CERTAIN RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN MEET THE STANDARDS TO HANDLE THE VERY VERY DANGEROUS ANIMALS BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF ANIMALS THAT COME INTO THE CALIFORNIA FOR RESEARCH CARPETS ARE NOT OTHERWISE TOUCHED. BY BY THIS STATUTE BECAUSE THERE'S A BUILT AN EXEMPTION FOR BOTH RESEARCH AND WELLAS INITIAL QUESTION ACCREDITED DO A LOGICAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALSO. LARGELY EXEMPTED FROM THIS PROVISION- AND ONE OTHER THING I CAN ADD TO THE- ON THE QUESTION ABOUT THE BILL WAS AMENDED- I COMMITTEE ORIGINALLY IS WRITTEN IT WOULD PROHIBIT IMPORT UNLESS THAT ANIMAL COULD BE TESTED TO ENSURE THEY WERE NOT QUITE. CARRIERS THAT WAS THE ISSUE OF CONCERN THAT WAS AMENDED TO. ALLOW FOR QUARANTINE FACILITIES AND OTHER REASONABLE MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT ANY ANIMALS THAT ARE BROUGHT IN THAT ARE TESTED TO HAVE CONCERNS CAN BE SAFELY TREATED THAT WOULD NOT ACT AS A BAN. ON THE IMPORTATION OF ANIMALS TO THE SMALLER ZOOS IT WOULD JUST ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT BRINGING IN ANIMALS WITHOUT SOME LEVEL OF ABILITY TO TREAT THEM. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER. THE BILL. IN MY CONCERN IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY ARE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS IN ORDER TO DO THIS RESEARCH AT THE NOW- THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO- YOU KNOW A GOOD PASS SOME OF THESE- VIRUSES AND DISEASES SO I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU BUT BY THE TIME OF THEM BE WERE. ON AUGUST. THIRD AND THIS IS ON THE FAST TRACK TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR SO. WHEN DO YOU PROPOSE THAT SOME OF THESE ISSUES CAN B. RESOLVED OR AT LEASTTHE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE- THE- INTERESTED. ARE THE AFFECTED PARTIES CAN HAPPEN. I'M READY TO DO THAT TOMORROW WITH YOU HOWEVER YOU'D LIKE I I'M I'M READY TO. RECONVENE WHAT WHEN AND THEY CAN BE WHATEVER CROSS SECTION OF THESE GROUPS AND SEE IF WE CAN. AFTER EVERYONE DIGESTED WHAT'S IN THE AMENDED SOME OF ITSEXISTING LAW THAT RENDON BROUGHT UP. ALL THAT ON THE TABLE TALK IT THROUGH AND- LOOK IF YOU CAN'T REACH A RESOLUTION I TOTALLY RESPECT THAT SOME PEOPLE WON'T SUPPORT THE BILL IN THE END BUT I REALLY. I THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'RE DARN CLOSE- I THINK THE COMMITTEE AMENDS LIKE YEAH I'VE GOT A SPARE BUT BUT YOU HAVE APPROACH- I'M SURE THERE WILL BE SOME COST SO I WOULD IMAGINE YOU'LL HAVE A MOMENT. AGO YOU KNOW WE GET WE GET ONE BITE AT THE APPLE THERE SO I DON'T. THIS YOU AND TRY TO FAST TRACK WITHOUT. ONE MORE BITE AT THE APPLE SO I WILL SIT DOWN AS SOON AS- YEAH SENATORS CAN CONVENIENT FEASIBLE THANK YOU- I LITERALLY TO THE ALREADY I MET THE TO THEM VIRTUALLY I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. CAN BE IN DOUBT BUT FROM WAY WAY FOR YOU NO WORRIES NO WORRIES. YOU KNOW I LOOK FOR TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU CAN KEEP ME AND HOPEFULLY THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE- A PRIZE AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. I AND THEN- THE BILL ALSO TALK ABOUT PROHIBITING POSSESSION OF TROPHY ANIMALS HOW IS THIS DOUBLE. I WOULD THE POSSESSION THAT COMPONENT FORCED THE IT WOULD. MEAN YOU HAVE TO HAS A PRETTY WELL. AND FOR ARCHITECTURE- WHERE THEY TRACK WITH THE THEY SHOULD BE TRACKING BLACK MARKETS IN OTHER BANNED ITEMS SO LIKE THINK OF OUR IVORY BAN OR- SOME OF OUR OTHER BAND ON ANIMAL PARTS. THOSE WE HAD TO GO BEYOND THAT HERE BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW AN IVORY ISSUE BUT THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARCHITECTURETHAT TRACKS A LOT OF THE BLACK MARKET ACTIVITY BUT TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT NOW. JUST TRACK COMMERCE SO THEY- THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS WHERE COME IN WITH A NEW COMPANY. REGULATIONS THEY CAN COME UNDER THE NEW TRUMP VERSION OF THE AT THAT IN IN THEIR THEIR THE TRUTH. THIS WILL BE TRACKING AT THAT POINT MEAN THE ABOVE BOARD PART OF THE OF THE INDUSTRY IS PRETTY PRETTY WELL REGULAR. WE THINK SHOULD SHOULD WORK. IN OTHER EIGHT. I MEAN IT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE YOU KNOW BAD PDF THAT HE'S GONNA COME NOT ON THE TO ANY WHO'S GOT A RELIC INTO IN THEIR INJURED CHECK IN HOUSE BY HOUSE HERE THAT NOT THE BILL THE BILL IS SET UP IT KICKS IN IN THE APPOINTED ACTIVISTS ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WITH THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE SAY. ANYWAY I DON'T NEED TO GO. THAT SO WHATEVER YOU LIKE. COM THE PERFECT SAID BECAUSE THERE'S A WERE I AM THE BILL THERE'S A REWARD FOR SOMEONE- TURNING IN AN INDIVIDUAL THAT BELIEVE HAVE A TROPHY ANIMAL. SOUL SOUL YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE HAVE A BY SYSTEM OF TRACING THROUGH THE- THE BOTH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OR THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT HOWEVER THERE IS A PROVISION OF A- REWARDING SOMEONE FOR TURNING AN INDIVIDUAL THAT FACT HAVE THE TROPHY ANIMAL- HOW IS THIS GOING TO WORK OUT ARE WE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW. ACCORDING A LOT RIGHT TO WEAR SOMEBODY LOOKING FOR THE OF THESE AND TO TURN IN BECAUSE OF THE REWARD IF HE ACTS SUCH A ROBOT THE ROBOT SYSTEM THEN WHAT IS THE NEED FOR WORDS SYSTEM- FOR TURNING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THESE. IT AWARD WE THINK IS IMPORTANT PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO THE BLACK MARKET AND NIGHT- ABIDE BY ALL THE PERMITS IN REGULATION HERE AND SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS A- MULTI MILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY MEAN. THE BLACK MARKET IN WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING AND- TROPHIES IN PART. GLOBALLY IS ONLY BEHIND THE DRUG TRADE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING SO THIS IS NOT LIKE SOME. JEFF IT'S NOT JUST MOM AND POPS OUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE. YOU KNOW- DOING THINGS ON IT INDIVIDUAL HOBBYIST BASIS THIS IS THERE IS A BIG. MARKET THAT DOESN'T WANT TO BE. I NOT NOT. MMAFIGHTING ANY THE FOLKS WHO WERE BEEN IN TRY TO DO THINGS ACCORDING TO LAW SO THAT PIECE OF IT THOSE WHO DOES WANT TO PLAY BY THE RULES WE HOPE THAT THAT THAT ARCHITECTURE HELPS GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT POWER. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN BUT- YOU KNOW JUST AGAIN ONE LAST COMMENT ABOUT THAT THE ILLICIT ARE BLACK MARKET WORD STRUGGLING WITHOUT WITH CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND THERE IS NO NO- RESOLUTION AND FIGHTS I HOPE THAT THIS DOESN'T- TURN INTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE THE UNDERGROUND MARKET DRIVING BECAUSE NOW WE'RE BANNING ALL OF THESE- YOU KNOW THE IMPORTATION. AND AGAIN BOARD YOU ARE COLOR BUT HAVING SINCE WITH HOW WE CAN MAKE BETTER. BECAUSE I'M- I'M- AS I. HOPE YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS BEFORE IT GETS TO BE A PART. THANK YOU THANK YOU BYE THE RUBIO I DON'T IF MY COULD GET WE A WE HAVE A- SKEWS ME. UP WE HAVE UNDER SOME MEMBER WHOSE. BEEN WAITING TO A QUESTION IN WILL WILL GO HEAD THERE ARE. AT SOME MEMBER DE THE MATH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR QUESTION FOR- THE AUTHOR- SENATOR ON PAGE TWELVE OF YOUR BILL YOU GET INTO THE DISCUSSION OF. FOOD MARKETS WHAT MARKET SIX CETERA AND BASED UPON THE LANGUAGE WITH IN YOUR BILL- THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON SOME OF OUR SEAFOOD MARKETS AND EVEN SOME OF THE AND LAND- IN CASES LIKE RED LOBSTER WHERE YOU CAN GO IN AND PICK THE LOBSTER THAT YOU WANT TO EAT- CAN YOU EXPAND UPON THIS TO ENSURE THAT OUR RETAIL RESTAURANTS THAT GO. THROUGH ST. THE HELP AND IF THE- GONNA HAVE ADVERSE OF TO THEM. SHORT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER VISIT. ONLY OF THOSE MOBSTERS HAVE A RISK OF MASSIVE VIRAL INFECTION FOR DO NOT AGREE IN THEIR PUT BY THE DEPARTMENT AFTER RIGOROUS STUDY THE WATCHLIST FED BDO BDO ONLY INTERVENTION POINT TO ANY KIND OF MARKET. BILL THAT ARENA RIGHT SO IT'S NOT DESIGNED A YEAH PRESIDENT REGULATED THE RESTAURANT LEVEL IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO GO AFTER- RESTAURANTS BUT BUT- LOOK I MEAN IF THERE WAS A HUGE GLOBAL VIRUS RELATED TO HOW LACKEY A- AND WE'RE IMPORTING TAPIA FROM CHINA. DARN RIGHT WE BETTER YOU KNOW TAKE IT LIKE BY STOP SELL THAT STUFF LIVE HERE RIGHT SO I MEAN IT'S- WE DIDN'T WANT TO. HAVE TRY TO PUT LEUPOLD IN THAT DO NOT A RISK SECTION SO THAT YOU KNOW ONE COULD SLIP THROUGH ANOTHER COULDN'T BUT THIS ISN'T REALLY. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO GO AFTER A RED LOBSTER OR MY LOCAL SEAFOOD PLACE- AND LIKEWISE FOR- FOR POULTRY MARKETS- FOR YOU KNOW ANY ANY KIND OF- BUTCHER SHOPS ANY OF THAT THIS IS NOT. SUPPOSED TO GO AFTER THAT KIND OF COMMERCE REALLY JUST THE COMMERCE THAT HAS. RISK OF. IT'S GOOD FOR IN. THANK YOU YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION CELEBRITY. FOLLOWED BY A DOCTOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR STERN FOR BRINGING THIS BACK LOADED FOR- A SIMILAR BILL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND- IT AND I FIND A TROPHY HUNTING TO BE MORALLY REPUGNANT- AND OF SOMETHING THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME I DID FIND THE B. ARTICLE THIS WEEK TO BE YOU INTERESTING. AND CHALLENGING FOR. IS THAT POINT AND SERVE THE POPULATIONS OF ANIMALS- ACROSS THE WORLD- AND PROTECT OUR ECOSYSTEM WHERE THEY RAISE THE FACT THAT BY BANNING TROPHY HUNTING WE MAY IN FACT BE CURTAILING EFFORTS TO PROTECT SPECIES BECAUSE OF THE FUNDS THAT DOCOME IN TWO COUNTRIES THAT ARE DOING WELL MANAGE CONSERVATION PROGRAM WITH THAT MONEY AND- AND IT IT IS SO COUNTERINTUITIVE IN VERY CHALLENGING FOR ME AND THE WORLD VIEW. THAT DO YOU BELIEVE IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE SOME TIME TO FIGURE OUT. IF WE CAN DETERMINE WELL MANAGED PROGRAMS THAT WE LOOK AT COUNTRY SPECIFIC FILTERS BY WHICH WE RECOGNIZE WHICH COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD ARE NOT CONSERVING ANIMAL POPULATIONS PROPERLY THAT ARE NOT USING THE FUNDS COLLECTED TO DO IT PROPERLY AND AGAIN I BELIEVE IT'S MORALLY REPUGNANT IT IS IMMORAL. TO DO I TO DO TROPHY HUNTING IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I UNDERSTAND BUT WE HAVE WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON THE VERY SAME GOAL TO ONE LIMIT HARM TO ANIMALS AND ALSO WELL THE TWO GOALS LIMIT HARM TO ANIMALS THE PAIN AND SUFFERING THAT THEY UNDERGO. AND ALL. TO BACK THE POPULATION. ONE AMAZING SPEED OF WHY THAT SHOULD BE HERE FOREVER- THAT HUMAN ACTION IS ACTIVELY- HURT YOU KNOW ENDING THE SPECIES TIME ON THIS PLANET AND- AND SO AGAIN VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE FOR ME TO READ A HOW BY US IN THE WAY THAT WE VIEW THE WORLD. AT THE WAY TO SET POLICY COULD END UP ACTUALLY HARMING SOME OF OUR GOALS AND SO I IN. TO FOR THIS TODAY BUT SENATORS I WOULD REALLY LIKE YOU TO WITH I YOUR TEAM TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S A WAY TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECTS BE USED AT THE FACT IN GROSS SPECIES AND IN A WAY TO DO THIS IN A WAY A IN AN S. A POLICY SETTING. I KNOW FOR THE THOSE THAT ARE LIKE ME. THAT HAVE EXTRAORDINARILY- EXTRAORDINARY STRONG MORAL CONCERNS ABOUT IT IT IS ANATHEMA TO WAY THAT WE FEEL IN THE WAY THAT WE SEE THIS ISSUE- AND SO THIS PART. BOB IS THE NOMINATION CHALLENGE OUR WRLD VIEWS. BUT I IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SEE WHAT THE OUTCOMES. OF LAWS LIKE THIS WOULD BE RATHER THAN THE STATED GOALS- NOT MEETING. THE OUTCOMES WERE LOOKING FOR. I ALSOWANT TO TAKE NOTE THAT WE'RE DOING THE WORK OF THE LEGISLATURE TODAY. WE'RE LOOKING AT A POLICY ISSUE ONE THAT WE'VE WRESTLED WITH FOR YEARS. WE ARE ALSO DOING THIS DURING THE COVE A PANDEMIC. AND THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT I THINK FITS UNDER- THE LANDS OF. KOBE OR EMERGENCY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION THAT SOME WOULD SAY WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON SO SENATOR STERN. WE'RE WE'RE GIVING YOU A LOT OF TIME HERE TODAY TO WRESTLE WITH THIS IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUE I WISH THAT YOU WOULD TALK TO YOUR COLLEAGUES. ABOUT DOING THE SAME. BUT MAYBE EVEN JUST ON CO THAT ARE WILD FIRE RELATED BILLS THAT YOUR HOUSE HAS JUST FAILED US ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOT. THANK YOU CHAIR ARE. AND THE SENATOR STERN. YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND I WOULD LIKE HIM TO HEAR TO RESPOND ABOUT THE WAY THAT IT'S YOUR TURN TIMES. LET'S NOT LET'S YOU'LL THE TIME TO THE AUTHOR YEAH THANK YOU. YOU AN APOLOGY DOCTOR CHOI WILL BE WITH YOU SHORTLY THANK YOU SO MEMBER FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS- AND FOR YOUR PASSED IN. SOUNDS LIKE CURRENT SUPPORT- I DO I DO THINK THE MASS EXTINCTION EVENT IS AN EMERGENCY WORTHY OF IMMEDIATE ACTION I THINK THE CLIMATE CRISIS WRIT LARGE CAN'T WAIT. A COUPLE THAT I THINK WE GOT TO DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME SO THAT WOULD BE BY SEVENTY OF ARGUMENT I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR- TWENTY. COMEDY AND PROGRESS HERE AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOU THERE I THINK- WILD FIRE FROM THESE OTHER VERY URGENT ISSUES ALSO SHOULD BE HEARD. AND I HOPE WE CAN FIND. A WHOLE LOT OF PROGRESS- ON A BICAMERAL BASIS IN THE WEEK AHEAD ON A SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THIS LEGISLATION AND WHETHER IT IT SORT OF YEAH UNINTENTIONALLY MIGHT- DO DO SOME HARM TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST POPULATIONS THAT DEPEND ON. THE HUNTING AND THREE I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS ONE IS. THE BILL ACTUALLY BUT THEN. BEGAN TO BE HUNTING. YOU CAN STILL GO TO ZIMBABWE AND PAY FORTY THOUSAND OUT. IN ORDER TO OPEN IN A- TEN TIMES YOU WANT A FIVE MINUTE PERIOD HOWEVER THE HUNT GOES AS WE'VE SEEN IN STARK RELIEF BUT IF THAT IS YOU TO. ANY ON YOU CAN GO AND YOUR MONEY ON THAT- AND YOU GET. HAD ALL AND PUT IT ON YOUR WAY THE STATE. WHEN I CAN BE PART OF COMMERCE THIS BILL. BUT WE ALL. THEY'RE ALL OVER IS A MY MORE POTENT TWAY. T. IF YOU WANT TO USE THAT ELEPHANT SAY AS COMMERCE. THAT ELEPHANT OVER A LIFETIME THE STATE ALIVE IS GOING TO GENERATE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN ECO TOURISM ACCORDING TO NOW YOU SEE. EDDIE OVER MILLION. YOU GET A FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR TO PERMIT ONE GUY ONE. WITH WHATEVER THAT HUNTING PARTY IS AND THAT'S IT SO THAT'S WHY STEP A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN MUCH MORE JOB IN A LOCAL. THE BILL BENEFIT FROM CONSERVE. THEN HUNTER. I WOULD LOVE HEAR FROM THE TESTING THE LEAD TO MONEY OWN IT. WOULD LOVE TO KNOW. ALL THE DOT FLOW IS. TING AN AFRICAN MAYES RIGHT THE THAT IS BEEN HARD COME BY OF WHEN THE MONEY. TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN HOW MUCH OF IT ACTUALLY DOES FLOW BACK TO THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY- IT'S BEEN TRICKY TO GET THAT DATA BUT IT APPEARS TO BE A LOT. STOPS ALONG THE WAY- BEYOND NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS GOING TO. BE AN IMPEDIMENT IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HADN'T DID VOMIT DELAYS. BUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO. COME BACK WE THEIR OWN EL TAILED OTHER SURE TO FOR OUR HERE AND I THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE RESPONSE I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO VISIT. A SORT OF GLOBAL CONSERVATION POLICY. IN A IN A MORE KIND OF RATIONAL. BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK WE GOT A GUEST. ACT ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS AND DO WHAT WE CAN TO PREVENT THIS EXTINCTION OF AT. THE SOME OF AS A FOLLOW UP. YEAH I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE SENATOR FOR- FOR HIS ANSWERS THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR TRUCK. OKAY SENATORS STERN- YOU. CAN UNDERSTAND ARE YOUR. INTENT OF THIS BILL. AND THEN I HAVE A TO AREAS OF ALL COURT PROCESS AND- I IN YOUR BILL TAXED ORDER PART. YOU ARE SAYING THAT SO ALMOST A SIXTY PERCENT OF ROMA- SO NOT A- DISEASES AND OVER 70% OF THIS ALL ASSUMES IS OUR OFFER ALMA Y. LARGE. ART IS- YOU WERE GUESTS ALL WAR IS A SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT YOU HAVE BASED. BECAUSE MY- FIRST QUESTION. SECOND QUESTION IS THAT THE LINE ELEVEN- ARE YOU ARE SAYING THAT. FIRST AND THE POOR WITH NINETEEN WERE LIKELY COST BY A TRANSMISSION BETWEEN POOR ANYMORE SPACES FOLLOW THE BY OUR TRANSMISSION TO HUMANS WITH THE CASES THAT INITIAL A SPREADING TOTAL MUST FOR SPACES. I WONDER WHETHER THIS IS SAW THE WORD LIKELY COSTS. BY YA ANYMORE TO SHOW MY- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY BUT I KNOW THAT THE ONE PROFESSOR FROM. HONG KONG WHO DEFECTED TOOK TO RAW THE UNITED STATES STATED THAT THE COFFEE NINETEEN VIRUS AWHILE ALL. MANUFACTURED IN A LABORATORY. DOES A ONE ONE FEWER UNIT IN THE SHE CLAIMS. AND I KNOW YOU ARE CLAIMING THIS IS UNLIKELY COSTA BY ANYONE ELSE. CAN YOU CLARIFY WHETHER THIS IS SO BASED ON FORM UPON OUR ANY SCIENTIFIC DATA OR IS A LIKELY COSTA WAS FOR YOUR OPINION. VERY GOOD- I LET ME IF YOU DON'T MINDACTED CHOI I'LL DO A HIGH LEVEL ANSWER AND THEN I'M GOING TO SEND IT TO- IF I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT RIGHT CITATIONS FOR YOU I'M GOING TO. GIVE MY EXPERT THE CHANCE TO GIVE ME HELP ME WITH THE FOOTNOTES HERE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FINDINGS. HI I AM I RIGHT YOU WERE IN SECTION ONE OF THE BILL. SORRY HE BILL HAD GONE IN ANOTHER QUESTION AGAIN MISTER THIS THIS IS SAID AND DONE THE FINDING SECTION DR YEAH THIS IS A FROM THE EARLY PART OF YOUR SECTION YOUR EXACT. ONE OF FIRST PAN OKAY UNDERSTANDING EVEN MONEY NOT GOT IT. YES SO WHAT THERE ARE A FEW CITED JOURNALS AND ALL THAT- DVD OR SKILL FILL IN THE SIXTY AND SEVENTY PERCENT- NUMBERS BUT- YOU KNOW WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE CORE INSTITUTIONS WE'VE BEEN RELYING ON FOR A LOT OF THIS TRANSMISSION DATA- AND IN TERMS OF THE- THE LIKELY CAUSE- LANGUAGE. THAT THAT DIDN'T REFER SPECIFICALLY TO THE ORIGINS OF COAL BID- I THINK THE WAY WE WHAT WE WROTE IT WAS SORT OF MORE BROADLY AROUND- THE LIKELY DISEASES AS OPPOSED TO LIKELY CAUSES SO THAT- THIS IS OFTEN. NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT IF IT IS NOT A DISEASE BUT BUT MANY OF THE- FINDING AS A VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH SECTION AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS FOUND THAT- DEAD BUT IT THOSE THAT THEY ARE LIKELY DISEASES THAT HAVE. IMPACTED CALIFORNIA NOT JUST PEOPLE BUT ALSO WILDLIFE. I PRINTED I WOULD. IF IT YEAH MADE ME HATE MAKE ME SOUND A LITTLE MORE- WELL CITED HERE IN MY SEARCH IT OKAY YEAH HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. SO THAT THE STATEMENT THAT AT 60% OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. I DO NOT ACT AND 70% OF THE DOCTOR THE THAT COME FROM WILDLIFE- THOSE NUMBERS ARE DIRECTLY FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL- WE CAN SEND YOU A LINK TO THEIR WEBSITE THAT HAS THEIR- THEIR FACT IN BACKGROUND. HAS NOT ACTED THE THAT. WILL THEN FELT HAVE MULTIPLE OTHER SITES- AND SIMILAR NUMBERS ARE USED BY THE- WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION FOR THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE I WOULD SAY PRETTY MUCH INDISPUTABLE. AS TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CO. THEY THAT ALSO- PRETTY MUCH AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL SORRY WE KNOW CAME FROM- AT THAT. JUMPED TO OBSERVE IT AND THEN TO PEOPLE FOR COLD AND IT'S ABOUT 99% CERTAIN THAT IT ORIGINATED IN A HORSESHOE BAT- WHICH IS A TYPE OF THAT IS MANY VARIETIES THERE IS NUMEROUS. STARTS RELATIVE VIRUSES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE FAMILY BACK. THE ONLY SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY IS WHETHER IT WENT BROWN OF COURSE YOU BACK. DIRECTLY TO PEOPLE OR WENT TO ANOTHER ANIMA FIRST. LIKELY A PANGOLIN AND THEN TO PEOPLE- THAT'S STILL BEING CUTE DOUBT BUT IT'S UNDISPUTED THAT- THE VIRUS ORIGINATED IN THE BACK- SO WHERE FULLY COMFORTABLE OUT WITH A STATEMENT IN THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A ANOTHER QUESTION FROM A SO MEMBER OFF OF CARL. WILL BE THE THANK YOU CHAIR- JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON ON THE OFFICIAL LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. I DON'T KNOW THERE'S BEEN A MOTION FOR THE MOTION FOR. THANK YOU I'M AND A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL AS TO HEARING THE HEARING OF THIS BILL. NOW SETTING ASIDE ANY INTER HOUSE FRUSTRATIONS THE REALITY IS THAT OUR SPEAKERS GIVEN US THE DISCRETION. TO HEAR BILLS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT COVER RELATED IF UNDER DISCUSSION OF THE CHAIR- I HEARD NINE BILLS AS LABOR CHAIR NOT ALL RECALLS RELATED AND I HAD THE RIGHT AND ABILITY TO DO THAT AS CHAIR AND I FULLY SUPPORT. OUR CHAIRS DECISION FOR HAVING THIS BILL HEARD- AND IT DOES FOR IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY FALLS WITHIN THE DISCRETION THAT OF AND GUIDANCE I SHOULD SAY- FROM OUR SPEAKER AND LEADERSHIP AND SO- YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY THAT THIS BILL IS BEFORE US TODAY. I ALSO DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS RELEVANT- AS TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM OF EXPERT TESTIMONY AS WELL AS SENATOR STERN- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTATION. OF ANIMALS TALK ABOUT MARKET. HAS SOMEHOW BEEN RELATED- WITH- THE INTERMINGLING OF HUMANS AND WILDLIFE FOR ANIMALS OF SOME SORT- AND AS WAS JUST INDICATED THAT'S LIKELY THE CASE HERE SO. REGARDLESS WHETHER IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE TRANSMISSION OF COVERT SPECIFICALLY THE REALITY IS THAT WE DO NOW- THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK- WILL WIN AS PER PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU HAVE- ANIMALS SO THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE MAINSTREAM. OF IMPORTATION FOR SOME RAP UP THE TROPHY ANIMALS OR IN SOME CASES SOME OF THESE- ANIMAL IMPORTATION THAT IS MORE UNIQUE- CERTAINLY. UP AND TO THE ISSUE AT HAND- PARTICULARLY SINCE WE HEARD. MOSTLY OF A GARDEN THAT THE CHAU. ANIMAL ASPECT OF IT HOW DOES A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS- LOOK AT BOTH OF THE SCIENCE- AND THE DATA AND I THINK YOU LOOK THE SCIENCE THE DATA ON THE ACTUAL REPORTS. AN INTERNATIONAL POURS SHOW THEY WILL SHOW THAT THE IMPACT OF ECO TOUR TOURISM ECONOMICALLY- IS FAR OUTPACING OF THAT ACT I'M A CAPTIVITY. UP FROM FEE HUNTING. AND SO. THE REALITY IS THAT ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME INTERESTS THAT ARE GOING TO WANT TO MAINTAIN- SOME FLOW OF THE ECONOMY- INTO THEIR COFFERS AND AS INDICATED BY THE AUTHOR- THEM THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE RESOURCES. OF IS ALSO. A QUESTION. HOWEVER ULTIMATELY. THIS ISN'T. ABOUT A JUDGMENT ON THE MORALITY OF ACTIONS. OF OTHERS OR OF NATIONS AND APHRODITE IT THIS HAS TO DO WITH US- THE THIS IS A JUDGMENT OF OUR OWN REALITY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE- BUT THEY CAN DO- WE'RE MAKING A STATEMENT ON WHAT WE'RE WILLING. TO INDOOR. AND SO IF WE GET IT NOT JUST MORALLY BUT SCIENTIFICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY- CALIFORNIA DOES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE- AND THE REALITY IS WE WOULDN'T BE HERE. IF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T ROLL BACK ONCE AGAIN A NOTHER OBAMA- ERA- REGULATION. AND THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS ALL ABOUT INCLUDING A BILL BUT I HAD. A PASSED AND SIGNED BY SIGNED INTO LAW THE MIGRATORY BIRD PROTECTION ACT WHICH WAS ACTIVATED TO AND OBAMA ERA. ARE ACTUALLY ONE HUNDRED YEAR- TREATY THE PUNCH WAS IN AND- A PART OF THIS ADMINISTRATION ROLLED BACK. IN SO. WE HAVE. ALL OF WE DON'T WE HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE. AS A STATE OF IF WE LOOK AT WHAT WE JUST DID RECENTLY IN LAST COUPLE YEARS. ON BANNING THE SALE OF COSMETICS THAT HAVE ANY ANIMAL TESTING WE WERE TOLD. THAT IT WAS GONNA BE TOLL THE- DESTROYER MARKET BECAUSE CHINA'S OFTEN ALLOW US TO IMPORT. BECAUSE MEDICS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT. CHINA'S HARD RELAX THOSE RULES BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF OUR MARKET. DOES THE INFLUENCE OF THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE- IN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND LEADERSHIP AND ANIMAL PROTECTION. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ONCE AGAIN MAKE A CLEAR STATEMENT. AS TO WHERE OUR VALUES ARE- TO NOT CONTRIBUTE. TO A PRACTICE- THAT IS FAR MORE DETRIMENTAL TO THE ENVIRONMENT EVEN IN TERMS OF CONSERVATION CERTAIN. THE ECO TOURISM- BUT IN TERMS OF. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THESE ANIMALS ARE EXTINCT IS BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICE. BUT YEAH CAN BE A PRACTICE. IS THAT MAY BETTER THAN WHAT IS AB THE PAST PLUS BUT. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT MORE VIABLE BUT- ECONOMICALLY IT DOESN'T MAKE MORE PROTECTIVE SCIENTIFICALLY AND IT DOESN'T MAKE IT- MORE OF MORAL- INAPPROPRIATE- THEN FOCUSING ON OTHER WAYS. TO CONSERVE AND AGAIN- JUST UNDER CERTAIN POINT WE'RE NOT TELLING ANYONE ELSE WHAT TO DO. WE'RE JUST MAKING- WE'RE MAKING A GESTURE BASED UPON OUR OWN MORALITY THAT DISTANCE WITH- WHERE OUR NATION WAS JUST. FOUR YEARS AGO. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU FOR THIS COMMENT YEAH I KNOW THAT YOU'LL SEE ANY OTHER MICROPHONES UP OF THE STRUGGLE OF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON TO THE AUTHOR I APPRECIATE YOUR- DILIGENCE IN TRYING TO RESPOND EVERYONE'S QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO COME BACK TO- RECOGNIZING- THIS RUBIO QUESTIONS THAT SHE HAD- YOUR SECTION THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY. WHEN YOU ANSWERED HER. MENTIONED ZOOS IT ALSO DOES NOT MENTION SANCTUARIES. THERE ARE A NUMBER SANCTUARY- FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF THEM HAPPENS TO BE THE LARGEST ONE IN THE STATE AND IT'S MY DISTRICT. MY CONCERN IS THAT THEY MIGHT BE AFFECTED. AND I. THIS YOU ADDRESS YOUR BILL YOU'RE GOING AND WORKING WITH MISS RUBIO ON ON THESE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE THE SANCTUARIES AND THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FACILITATE OUR THEIR THEIR MISSIONS AND GOALS TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE. SURE YOU MIGHT. PLEASE OKAY THANK YOU FAMILY MEMBER. I AM COMMITTED TO REFINING FURTHER THE BILL IF NECESSARY WITH MISS RUBIO AND HAPPY TO INCLUDE YOU IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS I ALSO ACTUALLY HAVE I HAVE A SMALL ZOO IN THE NORTH PART OF MY DISTRICT I HAVE GIVEN SANCTUARY IN THE SANTA CLARITA PAR THE DISTRICT I BORDER WITH- SENATOR WILL OKAY I HAVE A- MAJOR WILDLIFE THANK CENTURY RIGHT NEAR WHERE I LIVE THAT DOES A LOT OF MARINE LIFE SO I'M I'M REALLY INTO TO ALL THIS. TO WHAT AT WHAT I WHEN I TALK THEM AND WILL I THINK THE COMMITTEE AMENDED TRIED TO DO IS SAY WE GET TO KEEP MOVING ANIMALS IN THE CENTURIES OR THEY CAN KEEP COMING MALL ZOOS OR ANY OF THE BIG THING CHAIR OF THE COMMERCE OR NONPROFIT. BUT THAT IT IS SEEKING. DO NOT A TRADE RISK OF AN IN. SPECIES RIGHT OF AN OF AN AVID OUTSIDE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ANIMAL- THAT. IT'S GOT TO BE SUBJECT TO SOME KIND OF SCRUTINY AT THE VFW- BEYOND WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING IMPOSED IF WE IF WE NEED TO REFINE THAT FURTHER I'M- HAPPY TO DO IT I'M I'M I'M GOING BACK. INTO THE A MEN'S AREN'T IN PRINT PS. BUT I WANT. I I'D IT MIGHT HELP TO WALK THROUGH THOSE AT THE VERY END OF THE ANALYSIS IF YOU GO TO THE- KIND OF POTPOURRI PAGE FOR YOU HERE- SIXTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS- IN ADDITION THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PIECE- WHICH IS AMENDMENT ONE- THERE. IS AN AMENDMENT THREE- THAT A WAY FOR FOLKS TO SHOW THAT THEY'VE GOT A READILY AVAILABLE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT- AND THAT THE MAIN FOCUS IS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THAT THAT IS SORT OF IT THIS ISN'T DESIGNED TO BE GOING AFTER. NEWS SANCTUARY THAT'S THAT'S REALLY NOT THE FOCUS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND I THINK I'D BE IN HOT WATER MY OWN DISTRICT IF THAT WERE THE CASE BUT AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE GOOD ON THAT AND- HAPPY TO BRING YOU OR YOUR STAFF FOR WHOMEVER INTO THOSE DISCUSSIONS IS. BILL DOES MOVE ATTY MEDIAN AND APPROPRIATIONS I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE SENATOR I KNOW YOU'RE ON IT YOU'RE YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON WHO WANTS TO TRY TO GET THE BEST. RESULTS POSSIBLE AND I ACCEPT THAT. OFFER TO WORK WITH YOU ON CREATING THAT. LANGUAGE I THINK. BY THE FACT THAT ALL OF US ARE- TALKING ABOUT THE SAME SPECIFIC THING WERE BEING CONTACTED BY THE SAME FOLKS- PROBABLY- NOT KNOWING. EVERYONE'S THINKING AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT I CAN SEE THE COMMONALITY YEAR SO IT MUST BE AN ISSUE OF CONCERN. FOR THESE FOLKS WITH THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES ONE FIVE QUESTION FOR ME CAN YOU KINDA ADDRESS THE ISSUE. OF THE POTENTIAL ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT. THERE MIGHT BE CONFLICT WITH RESPECT TO THE- THE LAWS. WITH FEDERAL AND STATE AND THE FEDERAL. LAWS MIGHT PREEMPT AND TRUMP THE- THAT THAT THE STATE. WORK THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE CAN YOU. ADDRESS AT A SPECIAL CENTERS BEEN RULING ALREADY AT THE- APPEALS COURT. HERE CALVET THE NINTH. AND KNEW EACH. FIRST. YEAH SO. THIS BILL WILL WE PAY CLOSE IT TO THE LIVING OVER A NEW JERSEY STACKED AND CRAFTED THE BILL MERRILY IN A WAY TO AVOID ANY POTENTIAL PREEMPTION CHALLENGES OF COURSE WE'VE GOT A SEPARATE BILL BECAUSE IN THERE TOO SO THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BROADER PUBLIC HEALTH FRAMEWORK AND ALL THAT SHOULDN'T COLLAPSE IF THERE IS SOME- I'M KIND OF PRE EMPTION CHILD THAT IS SUCCESSFUL BUT IN. THEY REALLY STARTED INTRUDE ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT DEALING WITH TREATY INTERVENTION BUT I KNOW WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT INTERNATIONAL LONG WE'VE TALKED ABOUT COMMERCE IN IMPORTATIONS BUT- THIS BILL REALLY. ISN'T DESIGNED IN THAT SAME WAY. FURTHERMORE THE NEW JERSEY STATUE WAS WHEN WAS LITIGATED THE STATE DECIDED. NOT TO- THEY'D BE. THE WHAT. IN ANY THAT WE FEEL LIKE HAVE PRACTICE FOR A PO ANYTHING ON OUR STATE HERE SO. I DON'T THINK THE LITIGATION RISK IS HIGH I THINK THERE IS LITIGATION WILL WIN. AND IF WE LOSE AT THE SEVERABILITY HOPEFUL KEEP THE REST OF IT GATHER BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE TAKING A BIG GAMBLE HERE WITH WITH THIS VOTE HERE TODAY ON ON ON THAT LITIGATION FOR. BY WAY IF YOU WANT TO LOOK THAT PAGE FIFTEEN TO GOOD HAVE SEEN THE ANALYSIS ON THAT. ON THAT ISSUE THE COMMITTEE DOES GET A BIT TO. THAT EXACT QUESTION AND I THOUGHT THEY PUSHED OUT THAT THAT ISSUE QUITE WELL SO THAT'S ON FIFTEEN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. NOT I READ THAT THAT'S WHY I RAISE THE POINT IS I STILL HAD QUESTION MYSELF BUT NOT. EVERYONE IS AS MAYBE IT FIRST IN THAT PARTICULAR PART OF INTERNATIONAL LAW SO THAT MIGHT BE THE CASHIER. I UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU DAN IN ITS AND AGAIN. NOT WE WERE NOT GOING TO TOUCH THAT INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO INTERVENE ON THOSE INTERNATIONAL TREATIES THAT IS NOT THE- THOSE AREN'T THE MECHANICS OF THIS BILL. SO HOPEFULLY IN THAT WITH THAT SORT OF NARROWING WERE WERE OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I YIELD BACK MY TIME SOME NUMBER WE DO HAVE A MOTION. BY SOME EVER.
