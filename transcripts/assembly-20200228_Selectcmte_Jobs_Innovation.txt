OUR THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE VALLEY TOGETHER TO DISCUSS THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOBS AND- EVERYTHING THAT AFFECTS THE VALLEY BECAUSE WE ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT. FROM THE REST OF LOS ANGELES- I ALSO JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I- CAME HERE. IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE- AFTER WORKING IN THE FILM INDUSTRY FOR FOUR YEARS IN NEW YORK AND I MOVED OUT FOR A JOB I HAD GOTTEN AT PARAMOUNT PICTURES. IT'S BEEN OVER TWENTY YEARS IN THE FILM INDUSTRY AS A DEVELOPMENT EXECUTIVE AND FILM PRODUCER- MY- FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ARE. INDUSTRY MEMBERS- I A- INTIMATELY UNDERSTAND- HOW. THE HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS BUT ALSO THE CHALLENGES OF BEING AN EMPLOYEE. IN THE INDUSTRY- IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF OTHER TYPES OF JOBS AND- WE DO IT BECAUSE WE LOVE IT. AND ARE DRIVEN TO DO IT SOMETHING THAT I HAD WANTED TO DO FROM A YOUNG AGE WAS TO BE INVOLVED IN MOVIES AND TV. BUT IT'S ALSO NOT ALWAYS THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO DO SO. IN SUPPORTING THOSE THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN A FOCUS OF MINE SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I AM REALLY HAPPY TO SEE. FILM PRODUCTION HAVING SUCH A RENAISSANCE I'M IN LOS ANGELES. I LEFT THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE- PRODUCTION HAD ALL BUT STOPPED AT A CERTAIN POINT AND- THE PRODUCTION COMPANIES WERE. NOT RENEWING DEALS WITH PRODUCERS IN THE IN THE LANDSCAPE WAS CHANGING A LOT AND TO SEE. YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT P. CONTENT BUT SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL. SO I. CONSIDER THE- COMMISSION AND THE DIFFERENT- INDUSTRY MEMBERS TO BE PARTNERS OF MINE AND- I'M JUST HAPPY TO HAVE EVERYONE KIND OF IN THE ROOM TO DISCUSS AT THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT US ALL. THANK YOU FIRST I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER JESSE GABRIEL FOR CONVENING US SOME VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE- THIS COMMITTEE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR REGION TO THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. I REPRESENT THE EAST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY- VERY CLOSE TO THIS. YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AIRPORT IS MY DISTRICT- I LIVE IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD AND I THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE ON MY BLOCK THAT DOESN'T WORK IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. I HAVE AN ID W. LOOK TRICIA AND I HAVE SOME MEMBERS OF GUILDS. AND WRITERS OTHERS- YOU KNOW SO I'VE ONLY LIVED IN THAT HOUSE FOR A YEAR AND I'VE WHEN I GOT TO KNOW MY NEIGHBORS- I REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. IS FOR PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN MY DISTRICT- AND THEY WORK- AROUND THIS AREA BUT MOST RECENTLY YOU KNOW IT LIKE SPECIALLY PROCLAIM A AND FURTHER NORTH IN MY DISTRICT- THERE'S- A LOT OF STUDIOS POPPING UP- IS FOR STREAMING CONTENT LIKE HULU AND NETFLIX SHOWS ARE BEING FILMED. IN MY DISTRICT- IN SO I THINK IT'S- SOMETHING THAT I IT. I AM VERY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE JOBS FOR MY CONSTITUENTS- YOU KNOW THAT MY CONSTITUENTS ALWAYS TALK ABOUT WANTING. JOBS THAT ARE CLOSE TO THEIR HOME THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE- TO LONG BEACH OR TO THE ANTELOPE VALLEY OR WHEREVER- AND I THINK THIS CREATES. A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. TO GET ENGAGED IN AND INDUSTRY AND NOT FOR IT SHOULD JUST BE HAPPENING AROUND THEM AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE- AND LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING. FROM EVERYONE THAT'S HERE THANK YOU. AT THE RANGING TOO MUCH. GOOD MORNING FIRST AND FOREMOST- JESSE THANK YOU SO MUCH SO MEMBER GABRIEL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HOSTING THIS EVENT AND- IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE CONTINUE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE STATE OF ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY BUT BEFORE I GET TOO FAR COULDN'T HELP AS WE WERE DRIVING ON MAGNOLIA AND COMING IN TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN. HE COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT LEFT AND CART JOHNNY CARSON SHOW AND THINKING ABOUT THE SHIP THE PAN SHOTS OF- DOWNTOWN BEAUTIFUL DOWNTOWN BURBANK. SO I THINK IT'S TIMELY FOR US TO MAYBE DO SHOTS OF BURBANK THESE DAYS AND MAKE A COMPARISON AS WELL. YEAH SAN FERNANDO VALLEY HAS AN INTERESTING HISTORY AND A VERY INTEGRATED HISTORY WITH ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. WE WERE A CITY OR A REGION OF ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. UP UNTIL ABOUT EIGHTY YEARS AGO AND I HIGHLIGHT THIS ALL THE TIME TO SHOW HOW MUCH OF A PROGRESS. HAS BEEN MADE IN THE AREA BUT WITH THAT PROGRESS HAS COME ALSO CHALLENGES BECAUSE WE WENT FROM A ROUGHLY TWENTY THOUSAND THE CENSUS IS FROM NINETEEN THIRTIES WITH SAY. TWENTY THOUSAND POPULATION TO ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION. SO WITH THAT COMES A LOT OF STRESS ON EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORK FORCE AND ALL THE OTHER CHANGES THAT HAVE COME ABOUT. AND IF WE LOOK ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HAS THE AND DURING I CANNOT DEVELOPER THE AREA- DEFENSE CONTRACTS CAME AND WENT GM PLAN MANUFACTURING CAME AND. WENT BUT ENTERTAINMENT. GIVE LOSE THAT ALSO IMPACT THE AND- PLEASE IT'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF TIME. QUESTION CONTINUOUS THAT BUT LOOK FORWARD TO THE A AND THE LIVELY COME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH TO ALL OF MY CAR AND I AS THEY OWN THE INNER INTO AND THE CREATIVE ECONOMY ARE REALLY PART OF OUR OUR DNA HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN LOS ANGELES AND SO IS CENTRAL TO THE FABRIC OF OUR COMMUNITY HERE IN THE VALLEY AND- AND ALSO PART OF OUR OUR OUR ICONIC GLOBAL FREE AND WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF LOS ANGELES IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THEY THINK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND SO. YOU KNOW WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE FACT OF THE FACT THAT IT IS PART OF PART OF WHO WE ARE THAT IT'S A HUGE DRIVE OUR ECONOMY. WAS LOOKING A REPORT THE OTHER DAY THAT WE SAID THAT THERE ARE- MORE THAN TWO POINT SIX EIGHT MILLION JOBS THAT FLOW FROM THE CREATIVE ECONOMY HEARING CALIFORNIA THAT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THAT- WORKING IN OUR STATE BECAUSE OF FOLKS WHO ARE DOING MORE CREATIVE WORK. IN IN THE ENTERTAINMENT I WAS REALLY STRUCK ALSO BY- YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE INDIRECT JOBS RIGHT OF THOSE TWO POINT SIX MILLION THERE'S ABOUT A MILLION DIRECT JOBS AND ONE POINT SIX MILLION INDIRECT JOBS SO EVERY TIME WE ARE- BRINGING PRODUCTION HERE TO LOS ANGELES IT'S NOT JUST CREATING JOBS FOR FOLKS OR WORKING ON THAT PRODUCTION IT'S HAVING A- IN ECONOMIC RIPPLE EFFECT THAT IS REALLY REALLY BENEFITING THE BROADER COMMUNITY SO. TODAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US. STATE POLICYMAKERS TO LISTEN TO LEARN AND TO HOPEFULLY. TAKE BACK SOME OF YOUR WISDOM YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR INSIGHTS- TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN PARTNER WITH ALL OF YOU TO CONTINUE TO. STRENGTHEN ITS A STAY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT HERE. INDUSTRY HERE. IN LOS ANGELES AND IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SO OUR FIRST SPEAKER. AND PRESENTER BUT I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE WERE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE IS CALLING ABOUT. WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. THE MORNING EVERYONE OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR GABRIEL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY- EVERYBODY HEAR ME OKAY WITHOUT. YEAH BY GOD YEAH OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HIDE THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY'S VITAL ROLE AND CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND CULTURAL ENRICHMENT IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. FOR THIS HEARING TOPIC BECAUSE AS YOU ALL KNOW THE VALUE IS HOME TO MANY PRODUCTION COMPANIES FILM STUDIOS ANCILLARY SUPPORT INDUSTRIES LIKE SPECIAL EFFECTS MAKE UP FASHION. CATERING AND MANY MORE AND THIS IS A TOPIC THAT I KNOW YOUR SUBSEQUENT PAT PANELISTS WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND ON. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND MY NAME IS COLLEEN BELL AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION. PRIOR TO BEING APPOINTED TO THIS ROLE BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME LAST JUNE I SERVED AS THE US AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY- AND WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. I AM ALSO PROUD TO OF HAD DECADES OF EXPERIENCE. IN THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY AS A PRODUCER AND THREE TIME EMMY AWARD NOMINEE. IT IS WITH THIS EXPERIENCE AND PASSION THAT I SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CREATE JOBS GROW IN STATE PRODUCTION SPENDING AND GENERATE TAX REVENUES. THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION. A HIGH STATUS OF FILM AND TV PRODUCTION WHY CALIFORNIA. DESPITE GROWING GLOBAL COMPETITION TO HOST FILM AND TV PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA STILL OFFERS THE INDUSTRY UNPARALLELED VALUE. WERE AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE THE MOST SKILLED AND TALENTED CREWS. THE MOST DIVERSE AND DESIRABLE LOCATIONS THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE THE BEST WEATHER AND THAT COUNTS FOR A LOT AS YOU WOULD KNOW COMING FROM PRODUCTION DELAYS. EQUAL COSTS. IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA BOASTS A NETWORK OF MORE THAN SIXTY REGIONAL FILM OFFICES THAT WORK IN CONCERT WITH OUR TEAM AT THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION TO HELP FILMMAKERS FACILITATE PRODUCTION AND MAKE THE BEST OF OUR RESOURCES. THE STATUS OF JOBS AND WAGES THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY SUPPORTS A DYNAMIC CREATIVE ECONOMY HEARING CALIFORNIA WITH HIGH QUALITY JOBS FOR PEOPLE ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF SKILLS AND TRADES. THERE ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PRODUCTION RELATED JOBS OVER EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS RELATED TO DISTRIBUTION THERE ARE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY JOBS CREATED BY RELATED VENDORS AND ANCILLARY BUSINESSES. AND AGAIN THESE COME IN THE FORM OF SPECIAL EFFECTS TECHNICIANS LIKE MAKE UP ARTIST WRITERS STEP BUILDERS TICKET TAKERS ON AND ON AND ON. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL- MENTIONED THE RIPPLE EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY AND THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HAS A PROFOUND AND IMPORTANT RIPPLE EFFECT. MANY JOBS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WHICH PAY OVER TWENTY SIX BILLION IN WAGES ANNUALLY TO WORKERS STATEWIDE IT IS BEEN PROVEN THAT WHEN A MOVIE OR TELEVISION SHOW SHOOTS ON LOCATION. IT BRINGS JOBS REVENUE AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT THE PROVIDES AN IMMEDIATE BOOST TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. THIS IS AN EVOLUTIONARY TIME WITHIN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WITH THE TSUNAMI WAVE OF CONTENT DEMAND. STUDIOS AND STREAMING PLATFORMS ARE BUILDING THEIR LIBRARIES. AND CONSUMERS HAVE MORE OPTIONS FOR ACCESSING CONTENT ON DEVICES FROM THEIR PHONES COMPUTERS THEIR WATCHES YOU NAME IT TWENTY FOUR HOUR ACCESS TO CONTENT. SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT MANY STATES AND NATIONS ARE WORKING HARD TO GET INTO THE PRODUCTION BUSINESS. AT THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION WE RECENTLY RELEASED OUR PROGRESS REPORT ON THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF THE STATE'S FILM AND TAX CREDIT PROGRAM TO POINT OUT. THE FULL REPORT CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES NOW TO SHARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS. THE RESULT A FIRM THAT ARE UNIQUELY TARGETED TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IS HAVING A SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT. WITH THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION INVESTMENT OF TAX CREDIT RESERVATIONS APPROVED PRODUCTIONS ARE ON TRACK TO GENERATE NEARLY EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION OF DIRECT IN STATE SPENDING. THIS INCLUDES THREE BILLION AND QUALIFIED WAGES TO THE BELOW THE LINE WORKERS TWO POINT SIX BILLION AND QUALIFIED VENDOR EXPENDITURES AND ANOTHER TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION AND ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR TAX CREDITS. COLLECTIVELY TAX CREDIT PRODUCTIONS ARE HIRING MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CAST THIRTY SIX THOUSAND A CREW FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND BACKGROUND PERFORMERS AND STAND INS. AND THE LATTER IS MEASURED IN MANTIS. IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS EIGHTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT OUTSIDE THE LOS ANGELES THIRTY MILE STUDIO ZONE. WITH FORTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION AND LOCAL WAGES TWENTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION AND LOCAL PURCHASES AND RENTALS AND EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION AND HOTEL ROOMS AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. IN ADDITION NINE POINT FOUR MILLION GOES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR LOCATION AND PERMITTING FEES. THESE OUTSIDE THE ZONE FIGURES ARE GOOD. WHAT WE WANT TO PROMOTE EVEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY TO MAKE SURE PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. OUR TEAM AT THE FILM COMMITTED COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD ELIMINATING BARRIERS TO FILMING WHILE MAINTAINING AND CREATING FILM FRIENDLY PRACTICES AND POLICIES AND OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR WORK TO MARKET CALIFORNIA AS PREMIER FILMING DESTINATION THAT IT IS. THE FUTURE FOR FILM AND TV PRODUCTION AND THE FACT IS MANY PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY FEEL. ROAD WEARY. I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD THAT MANY OF YOU HERE TODAY. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA TO WORK IN OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. WHEN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING FILMS FOR FAMILIES. OFTEN AND YET THE PROCESS TEARS FAMILIES APART. WE KNOW THAT OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES ARE ALSO MAKING HEAVY INVESTMENTS TO ATTRACT PRODUCTION AND WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING THAT IN DESTRY WANTS TO BE HERE THEY WANT TO BE HERE AND ICE I SPEAK TO THAT HAVING MEETINGS ALL OVER WITH THE DECISION MAKER. IS THAT THEY WANT TO BE HERE AND CALIFORNIA. THOUGH THE TRUE REALITY IS. IS THERE AGGRESSIVE IS SENT INCENTIVES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE CHALLENGED BY EVERY DAY. WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING OUR COMPETITIVENESS IN THIS IMPORTANT SECTOR BEFORE PROGRAM TO POINT EL PRODUCTIONS OF ALL TYPES WERE LEAVING CALIFORNIA IN DROVES. WHEN PRODUCTION TWO POINT OH LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT EXPANDED PROJECT ELIGIBILITY AND INCREASED INCENTIVE FUNDING TO KEEP MORE PRODUCTION HERE AT HOME. BUT I WOULD NOT CALL IT A REVERSAL. PROGRAM THREE POINT EL THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NEW PROGRAM WILL ROLL OUT IN JULY AND INCLUDE A MORE ROBUST SKILLS TRAINING PILOT PROGRAM TARGETING INDIVIDUALS FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FOR TRAINING AND SKILLED PRODUCTION JOBS. IN ADDITION PROGRAM THREE POINT OH REQUIRES TAX CREDIT PROJECTS TO REPORT CREW EMPLOYMENT DIVERSITY DATA TO THE CFC. ALL PARTICIPATING PROJECTS EXCEPT LOW BUDGET INDEPENDENT PROJECTS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF THE PRODUCTION COMPANIES VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS FOR INCREASING REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES. IN SUMMARY THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS VITAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND THE GOVERNOR AND I ARE COMMITTED TO KEEPING IT HERE AT HOME. OTHER STATES AND NATIONS ARE WORKING HARD TO LOWER PRODUCTION BECAUSE THEY'VE DISCOVERED WHAT WE'VE KNOWN FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY THAT THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY PROVIDES A PATH TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPERITY. IT IS CLEAR OUR FILM TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE AND IT DELIVERS A GREAT RETURN TO TAXPAYERS AND WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S COMMITMENT TO MAKING THE INDUSTRY. AND ONGOING PRIORITY. THANK YOU FOR MUCH THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALL TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE OVERVIEW AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE ON THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION AND FOR GOVERNOR SOME AND ALL OF HIS LEADERSHIP ON THESE. ON THESE ISSUES AS WELL- I THINK WITH THAT OVERVIEW IN MIND WILL BE VERY HELPFUL AS WE SET THE STAGE. FOR OUR FIRST PANEL DISCUSSION- AND HERE TO GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE- ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OUR- PAUL ADLAI THE PRESIDENT OF FILM LA. AND TOM DAVIS WHO IS THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL VICE PRESIDENT OF BIOPSY. MORNING GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR US TO I AM NOT PAUL ODDLY I AM PAUL I LEASE STUNT DOUBLE OR PERHAPS AS UNDERSTUDY I'M PHILLIP SOKOLOWSKI VICE PRESIDENT OF INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS FOR FILM LA WE ARE THE GROUP THE COORDINATES ON LOCATION FILMING FOR ALL TYPES OF PRODUCTION IN MANY OF THE PARTS OF GREATER LOS ANGELES INCLUDING NOT BURBANK BUT WE DO SERVE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE IN BURBANK SO- WHEN PRODUCTION NEEDS TO HAPPEN ON LOCATION THAT WORKS OF OUR OFFICE TO OBTAIN ALL THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENT PERMISSION. MY TEAM ALSO INCLUDES DEDICATED RESOURCES FOR ECONOMIC RESEARCH COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND A PROACTIVE CAPACITY AND OF COURSE MARKETING THE REGION TO FILMMAKERS AS A DESTINATION OF CHOICE FOR PRODUCTION. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION- JUST GREATLY APPRECIATED AND- SO IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE SAID FRONT OF A GROUP AND TALK ABOUT- DEAL WHERE THE ENERGY IS SORT OF- BOUNCE BACK FROM WHERE IT WAS. PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF THE- CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION TAX- TAX INCENTIVES. ACTUALLY THE ACTUAL TITLE WAS. THE CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION. ACTION JOB RETENTION ACT RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE BEAR MIND AS WE TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY AND ON THE EMPLOYMENT THAT THE THIS THAT THE INDUSTRY- PROVIDES FOR THOSE PEOPLE- TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING AND MIDDLE CLASS LIVING. SO ONE OF THE OF THINGS THAT I WAS WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO POINT OUT IS. THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM. STE DURING THE- THE FOR YEARS PRIOR TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE UNION SAW A MOUSE TO CLIMB. IN IN IN THE IN THE- IN THE WORK FORCE HERE IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA RIGHT WHEN WE HAD THE IS WHAT ALL CALLING ASSAULT- BY OTHER LOCALES BEGINS THE INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA REACTED TO AN EXTENT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BUT NOT REALIZING THE FULL MAGNITUDE OF. OF THE- RESOLVE OF THE OTHER STATES OUT. WAS A LITTLE SHORT AND- IN THE REACTION SO THE PROGRAM WAS PLAYED PUT IN PLACE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR PROGRAM AND IT COVER ONLY CERTAIN TYPES OF PROJECTS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE- AND THIS IS ERIN YOU'RE PART OF THAT THAT EFFORT AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE DAHLE THE OFFER SO YOU PUT DOWN ON THAT SAW FIT TO. MAKE THE PROGRAM MORE OF US. AND I THINK THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT. YOU WE WENT BACK AND WE LOOKED AT NUMBERS I WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET THE NUMBERS FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- BUT TO THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY PENSIONS PENSION PLAN. AND SIR DEMONSTRATES. WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THAT IN THAT PERIOD. WE HAD- AGAIN A PROCTOR THAT WE SAW A DECLINE IN IN HOURS CONTRIBUTED TO THESE PLANS ALL THIS IS ONLY ONE OF FOUR INDUSTRY PLANS RIGHT ACTION ONE OF FIVE INDUSTRY PLANS. BUT IT COVERS A BROAD PROBABLY ABOUT 60% OF ALL ALL THE WORK CONTRIBUTIONS COMING IN PLACE OF THE POINT ON ON CORRECTIONS. AND DURING THAT PERIOD WE SAW AN INCREASE. HOURS ARE WE COULD DISTRIBUTE DIRECTLY TO THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS FOR PILOTS IT WAS THIRTY ONE OF THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN. HOURS FEATURE FILMS WAS. OUR TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED AND FIVE HOURS THE TELEVISION OR WE REALLY SAW THE CHANGE THAT JUMPED TO TEN MINUTES OVER TEN MILLION HOURS JUST ATTRIBUTED TO. THIS PROGRAM AND SO I THINK THAT DEMONSTRATES HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS FOR THE TOTAL NUMBERS IF ANYONE'S INTERESTED IS THIRTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION HOURS. DURING THAT TIME PERIOD JUST TO THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL MEANT THAT- OUR MEMBERS WERE ABLE TO MAKE MAKE A LIVING RECAPTURE. OF THAT LIFESTYLE THAT THAT THAT THEY SAW SLIPPING AWAY. WE SAW PEOPLE COME BACK FROM THOSE OTHER LOCATIONS FROM GEORGIA AND WE. AND THEN WE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY. AS MS BELL HAD MENTIONED EARLIER RIGHT WE'RE WE ARE LOOKING AT ECONOMIC GROWTH IN GIVING OPPORTUNITIES TO PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE MAY NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY COME INTO THE INDUSTRY. BECAUSE OF THAT GROWTH THROUGH THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS ON THE ALBUM THE STREAMING AND WITH THE NATURAL GROWTH TOOK PLACE AS A RESULT OF THAT. WE'RE ABLE TO EMBARK ON A PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN REACH INTO AREAS OF THE CITY. THAT WERE TRADITIONALLY UNDER REPRESENTED. IN THE IN THE INDUSTRY. INCREDIBLE UP OR WHAT WE REFER TO AS A PATHWAYS PROGRAM HOURS OF THIS PILOT STAGE OF IT RIGHT NOW. BUT IS ABOUT CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYBODY AND I'M VERY PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITHOUT AND IN THE LAW SHALL BE COMING UP. WITH THAT PROGRAM VERY VERY SHORTLY. SORRY ON ATLANTIC QUESTIONS AFTER AFTER THE HEARING ON THAT FILM WAS INTERESTED BUT IS GIVEN A SORT OF A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY THERE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER OPTION IS WE SEE COME ABOUT IS ALSO THAN TECHNOLOGIES OF TECHNOLOGY IS SOMETHING THAT- QUITE FRANKLY WE IN THE UNION MOVEMENT AND BRACE BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS IS THAT EVERY TIME TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. JOBS COME WITH THOSE TECHNOLOGIES RIGHT BECAUSE MAY CHANGE BUT IF YOU STAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE YOU CAN EMBRACE THOSE TECHNOLOGIES. AND BRACELETS JOBS THAT COME ALONG WITH IT. AND YOU END UP PROSPERING AS A RESULT. OF YES IT'S INTERESTING THE NUMBERS THAT TOM REFERENCES AND WHAT THE IMPACT HAS BEEN TO- UNION MEMBERSHIP. IS REFLECTED ALSO IN THE PRODUCTION VOLUME WE SEE HAPPENING IN LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS. TWO THOUSAND NINE WAS ONE OF THE DARKEST DAYS FOR ON LOCATION PRODUCTION IN LOS ANGELES COINCIDENTALLY THAT'S THE YEAR THAT THE FIRST TAX CREDIT PROGRAM CAME ON BOARD. AND WE STARTED TO SEE THE REVERSAL HAPPENED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE TIME PROGRAM TWO POINT OH KICKED AND WE WERE REALLY COOKING WITH FIRE WE HAD OUR GREATEST EVER YEARS FOR ON LOCATION PRODUCTION. EVER EVER IN 200-016-2017 WAS THE SECOND BEST YEAR OF PRODUCTION TWENTY EIGHTEEN FELL RIGHT IN LINE WITH THAT. VERY INTERESTINGLY LAST YEAR AND TWENTY NINETEEN WE SAW SMALL DECREASE IN PRODUCTION. AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE REASONS WHY IT CERTAINLY ISN'T BECAUSE THERE AREN'T WORK OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR- OUR ENTERTAINMENT CREWS OR CAST. IT'S BECAUSE WE FACE CAPACITY ISSUES SO LOS ANGELES HAS FILLED TO THE POINT THAT CERTAIN KINDS OF PRODUCTION HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING THE DECISION TO LOCATE HERE. SOUNDSTAGE CAPACITY ESPECIALLY THE CERTIFIED ONES THAT ARE OF GREAT USE TO FEATURE PRODUCTION. MANY OF THEM ARE OPERATING AT 9698% CAPACITY AND THAT MEANS. IF YOU'RE MAKING A PRODUCTION DECISION. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE OF AVAILABLE OPTIONS AND CALIFORNIA'S IN THE COMPETITION. BUT THERE SIMPLY ISN'T SPACE. SO EVEN AS OUR NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO BEAR AN INCREASED LEVEL OF PRODUCTION AND CERTAINLY INCREASED THE EFFORT WE PUT FORTH INTO MAKING SURE PRODUCTION A SUSTAINABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT ITS GROWTH CONTINUALLY TO. SO WE WOULD WELCOME ANY AND ALL OF PIONEERING SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE THAT PIECE OF IT BECAUSE WE LIKE TO SEE. LOS ANGELES CONTINUE TO BE. ACTIVE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THAT PLACE THE FILMMAKERS SEE IS OPEN- AND- THAT'S ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD SIDE AND ON THE FACILITIES SIDE WE NEED ALL OF THOSE PIECES AND PLACE. JOINT ANYTHING ELSE- WELL THE ONLY I MEAN OUT ON THAT IS YOU WHY THINK ONE OF THE- BENEFITS THE THAT WE- THAT WE HAVE IN THIS REGION. THE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS FROM LA IN THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION THE COORDINATION. THAT ALL THESE AGENCIES EXERCISE IN IN THE NEWS THE ASSISTANCE OF A PRODUCTION. RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT- YOU WOULD HAVE MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS COMPETING WITH ONE NOT ONLY COMPETING WITH ONE ANOTHER WHICH THEY ACTUALLY DO BUT I'M NOT BEING OF A QUARTER RIGHT SO YES WE ALL KNOW LOS ANGELES IS A- CITY MADE UP OF SAID. AND THE OTHERS DO YOU HAVE IN THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY HAND LOS ANGELES AND ACROSS THE STREET HERE IN ANOTHER CITY AND IT'S BECAUSE OF. THE EFFORTS OF- FAMILY IN THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION THAT ALL THAT GETS CALLED NAME TRYING TO GATHER WHICH- YOU KNOW I SORT OF HAVE STOOD TO THE SENSE OF BEING SO FRIENDLY EVERY. GREAT VERY GOOD THANK YOU ANYBODY HAVE QUESTIONS FOR HIM. I'M JUST IF YOU COULD SEE. I THREE FOR TO ARKHAM. OR SOUND STAGE CAPACITY AND- ACCORDING TO YOUR CAPACITY AND IF YOU FEEL THAT- WERE KEEPING ARE WE LOSING PRODUCTIONS BECAUSE OF LACK OF SPACE AND CAPACITY. LOOKING TO WHAT EXTENT WILL THE SEARCH FOR AVAILABLE STAGE SPACE IS NOW A GLOBAL PHENOMENON SO WHEN LOOKING FOR STAGES THAT CAN SUPPORT A LARGER BUDGET FEATURE FILM FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S NOT A WORLDWIDE SEARCH AND IT'S NOT JUST LOS ANGELES IT IS FACING THIS CRUNCH PROBLEM IT IS EVERY OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTION DESTINATION ON THE GLOBE. SO TO SOME EXTENT IT MUST BE HAVING AN EFFECT- BUT TO THE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF IT WE DO HAVE EXCESS CAPACITY IN THE REGION BUT IT'S OF A KIND RIGHT- WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE STUDIO FACILITIES THAT EXIST IN THE NORTH- EAST VALLEY AND THERE IS ACTUALLY A- PURPOSE BUILT. DEDICATED FACILITY IN THE NEW QUIXOTE FACILITY- THAT WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT LARGER BUDGET FEATURES. BUT A LOT OF THE SPACE THAT IS NOW BEING USED FOR PRODUCTION IS ADAPTIVE RE USE IT WAS FORMALLY WAREHOUSE IT WAS FORMALLY SOME OTHER. PURPOSE AND IT IS NOT PURPOSE BUILT FOR FILM PRODUCTION IT ALSO DOESN'T HAVE THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES AROUND IT SUCH AS THE STUDIO- SUPPORT SERVICES THEY'RE THEY'RE LOCATED IN PLACES WHERE THERE SIMPLY ISN'T SPACE TO PUT THAT. SO WE HAVE THE LARGEST POSSIBLE INVENTORY OF ANY OTHER- PRODUCTION CENTER IN THE WORLD FIVE POINT SIX FIVE POINT THREE MILLION SQUARE FEET OF STUDIO SPACE- BUT NOT ALL OF IT IS OF THE SAME. CALIBER IN QUALITY NOT ALL OF IT CAN SUPPORT THE SAME KINDS OF PRODUCTION SO IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU NEED BACK. IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE BIG BUDGET FEATURES WE ARE OUT OF THAT ROOM AND ARE YOU HAVING A SENSE OF HOW MUCH REAL ESTATE PRICES AND RENT PRICES ARE AFFECTING. YOUR SUPPORT SERVICE INDUSTRY I JUST TO GIVE YOU SORT OF AND AN ANNEX TOTAL EXAMPLE OF THIS THERE'S FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS A VERY LARGE PROP HOUSE. HERE IN THE AREA. WHO WAS AFRAID OF LOSING- HER BUSINESS BECAUSE HER. PRIEST TO I THINK THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR HER WAREHOUSE TYPE SPACE AND SHE FELT SHE WAS COMPETING AGAINST CANNABIS GROWERS AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER. INDUSTRIES THAT WERE WILLING TO PAY MORE ARE YOU HEARING- SUPPORT STOP HAVING TO RELOCATE OR JUST NOT BE ABLE TO FUNCTION BECAUSE OF THAT. WE HAVE HEARD STORIES LIKE THAT ANECDOTALLY FROM TIME TO TIME THE BLOOM IN REAL ESTATE IS ALSO CREATED SCARCITY FOR THINGS LIKE PRODUCTION PARKING. LEARN AREA OF THE CITY LIKE WHERE FAMILY IS HEADQUARTERED IN HOLLYWOOD WE HAVE CRANES TO ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS LOOKING OUT OF OUR OFFICE WINDOWS. AND THAT'S TAKEN AWAY VERY VALUABLE SURFACE LOTS THAT PRODUCTION CREWS RELIED UPON FOR BASS CAMPING. YOU CAN'T BASE CAMP YOU CAN'T PUT ALL THOSE VEHICLES INTO NEIGHBORHOODS AND STILL MAINTAIN A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE SO. IN VERY MANY WAYS THE REAL ESTATE AND DEVELOPMENT MARKETING LOS ANGELES IS AFFECTING THE FACE OF PRODUCTION. AND WE NEED TO BE VERY VERY DELIBERATE AND WORKING WITH OUR CITY AND COUNTY PARTNERS AND MAINTAINING THE- ACCESSIBILITY NOT JUST FOR ON LOCATION FILMING BUT ACCESS FOR THE VENDOR SUPPLY THE PEOPLE WHO. WITHOUT WHOM WE COULD NOT DO WHAT WE DO HERE I GUESS I'LL DISCUSS LASTLY ARE YOU HAVING SUCCESS WITH CITIES HELPING TO CARVE OUT SPACES FOR- FOR THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY. WE HAVE SEEN REAL SUCCESS AND WORKING WITH COUNTY PARTNERS TO USING THEIR INFLUENCE ARE WORKING. TO FIND PARCELS TO FIND POTENTIAL PLACES WHERE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE HAD- THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S VERY INTERESTING- STORY THERE IS A- PROP GREENERY HOUSE. THAT IS LOCATED IN A POWER TRANSMISSION CORDER MAY PARK ALL OF THEIR SHRUBS AND WHATNOT BENEATH THAT POWER LINE. AND THEIR LEASE WAS RECENTLY THREATENED BECAUSE THE LAND COULD BE USED TO SOME OTHER MORE VALUABLE PURPOSE EMILY PUBLIC STORAGE. SOMEONE BROUGHT THAT TO THE COUNTIES ATTENTION. THEY ENGAGED ON THE ISSUE WITH US AND I BELIEVE WE'RE WORKING OUT SOME KIND OF ACCOMMODATION THERE BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT. YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT VALUE IT HAS TO A BUSINESS THEY COULD NOT FUNCTION WERE IT NOT FOR. THE INEXPENSIVE AVAILABILITY OF THAT SPACE SO STORIES LIKE OUTBOUND WE HAVE TO BE ATTENTIVE TO THEM ENGINE THAT HOUSE AND IT IS IN IS AN ISSUE I WAS TALKING WITH THE- BY ONE OF OUR PLAYERS. ARE JUST LAST WEEK ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE THE SISTER OF ONE OF THE S. INQUIRES. STORAGE FROM AND STORAGE. AND THEY'RE FINDING THAT. THEY'RE HAVING. TO GO FOR THE ROCK. RIGHT IN TO MAKE YOU MEET UP TO THE CONCERT. BUT THERE UP BUT YOU KNOW BUT THEY FIND INCREASE SHALL. BECAUSE INCREASE ACROSS TRANSPORTATION. EN ALSO MAKES IT HARDER FOR THE EMPLOYERS RIGHT BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE TO DRIVE FOR GROUND AWAY FROM THE CALLS. SO IT HAS IT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ON MORE THAN JUST. JUST THE COST OF THE ROOM YOU KNOW. YOUR POINT- INSIST AVAILABILITY FOR. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS SURE. FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS MY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE PATHWAYS PROGRAM THAT MISTER DAVIS THAT YOU MENTIONED AND I KNOW MISS SPELL ALSO- TALKED ABOUT OUT REACH- TO UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S SOMETHING I REALLY CARE ABOUT- YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT IS 70% LATINO ALL OF THIS PRODUCTION IS HAPPENING AROUND THE NORTHEAST VALLEY- AND SO I'M CURIOUS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND HOW. YOU KNOW WHAT DIVERSITY NOT JUST IN HOLLYWOOD AND ON THE SCREEN BUT I PARTICULAR INTEREST IN DIVERSITY AND WHO'S BEHIND THE SCENES- AND I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY AND OF THIS PROGRAM IS OPPORTUNITY RIGHT TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY ESPECIALLY IN OUR STATE IS INVESTING- IN THIS INDUSTRY- AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT IN AND WHERE WE ARE IN THAT PROGRAM I WOULD LOVE TO BE ALLOWED TO CONVERSATION. WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW AND LIKE IN YOUR DISTRICT DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE STUDIOS THE BILL OF RIGHTS YEAH AND SO- YEAH ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WAS MISSED ON THAT QUITE FRANKLY MY TO DO. IS STOP THE LOCAL HIGH REQUIRE. RIGHT WHY WASN'T THAT DONE OKAY WHAT WE SHOULD TALK THAT BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. QUESTION SOMETIME AGO ON. RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THAT- REALLY THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY. RIGHT AND SO I THINK THERE'S STILL ONE OF TIME OKAY BUT WE SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION THE TIME DOWN ON THAT ISSUE OKAY THANK YOU I WILL. FOLLOW UP THANK YOU FOR THAT. FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU FOR BOTH FOR BEING HERE- TOM IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL WORKING WITH YOU GOING BACK TO. TWO THOUSAND SIX TWO THOUSAND SEVEN- WE'RE FAR CRY FROM THEN- GIVEN GIVEN WHERE THE INDUSTRY HAS COME- AND- THE RECEPTIVENESS OF THE STATE ALSO CHANGING- BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFICULT PRIOR TO THAT TO GET THE ATTENTION AFTER SO MANY FAILED ATTEMPTS. IT IS SO GOOD COMMENT AND THEN A QUESTION FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU MISSPELLED FOR BRINGING UP- THE HUMAN COST ISSUE THAT USUALLY DOESN'T GET DRESSED AND A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS. YOU TRY CANVASSING IN MY DISTRICT AND GO DOOR TO DOOR- YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE EITHER ABSENT OR ONE OF THEM IS A WAY FOR- AND- THAT'S NOT ANECDOTAL IT'S LITERALLY EVERY OTHER HOUSE. AND EVERY OTHER HOUSES A REALTOR SPECIALLY IN STUDIO CITY. BUT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN THERE ARE REPORTS THAT SAY THAT ONE THIRD OF THE TAX CREDITS. WERE. WENT TO PROJECTS THAT COULD HAVE OTHERWISE HAVE STILL HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN CALIFORNIA SOMETIMES I WHAT I DON'T HEAR. BACK IS WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE'S AN UNCERTAINTY THAT GETS SPOKEN ABOUT BUT- THE FACT THAT IT'S KEPT FAMILIES WHOLE. AND THAT WE'VE FOR GONE COSTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT COMES IN WITH COUNSELING AND THERAPY AND GOD KNOWS ALL THE OTHER COSTS THAT DON'T EVEN GET ACCOUNTED FOR. A JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WE WERE GOING TO BE HOSTING AN INFORMAL HEARING ABOUT WHAT THE COST IS ON FAMILIES AND THEN INSTEAD WE PARTNERED UP WITH- SOME OF THE UNIONS- AND- WE HOSTED- JOB PLACEMENT. PROGRAM WHICH WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND WE'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE. BUT I'D I DON'T THINK THAT GETS ENOUGH COVERAGE AND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT ITEM TO PUT. DOLLARS TO. QUANTIFYING THAT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. BUT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO SPEAK MORE TO THAT AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE- HOW WE CAN ASSOCIATE A DOLLAR SIGN TACKED TO THAT. ISSUE BECAUSE- SOMETIMES THE BIGGEST COSTS ARE THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T REALIZE HOW THEY'RE CREEPING UP ON US. WHEN YOU HAVE HEARINGS AND HEALTH CARE RIGHT NOW AND SEE THAT. POTENTIALLY OF FORCE TO A FIFTH OF THE COST GO TO INEFFICIENCIES- YOU CAN PROBABLY. SAY THAT THAT IS ALSO AN ERROR THOSE INEFFICIENCIES APPLY TO MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES AS WELL. AND PART OF THAT IS THE HUMAN COST THAT DOES NOT GET VALUE FOR. THAT'S SUCH AS THE COMMENTS I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRING THAT UP I HEARD THAT THEY APPRECIATE THAT- ANECDOTALLY SPEAKING. SEE A LOT OF GEORGIA LICENSE PLATES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD- AND GIVEN HOW COMPETITIVE FIERCELY COMPETITIVE. GEORGIA HAS BEEN WITH CALIFORNIA AND GIVEN THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A WORTHWHILE CONVERSATION BUT I. HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT. DIRECTION IT SHOULD BE AND BUT CAN YOU DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES BOTH WITH PERMITS AS WELL AS WITH. WITH MANPOWER JOBS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CALIFORNIA AND GEORGIA. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE AND I KNOW THE FOCUS IS ELSEWHERE AS WELL IN CANADA AND ENGLAND AND OTHER PLACES BUT AT LEAST GEORGIA. PROVIDES A GOOD DOMESTIC. WHAT WAS SENTIENT ABOUT THE GEORGIA PLACES- WHAT WE'RE SAYING WE HAVE MEMBERS WHO HAD MOVED TO GEORGIA. RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE WORK THEY COULD MAKE A LIVING ON IT WE'RE TALKING PEOPLE. WHO WERE BORN AND RAISED SORRY MR LIVES TO I'M JUST SPEAKING INTO MICROPHONE. YOU KNOW. THE BUT OVER HERE IN THIS FOR THE PUBLIC DEMÓCRATAS WANTS TO EVERYBODY WATCHING AT HOME WHAT'S REALLY. YOU SHOULDN'T SAID THAT- SO. YEAH WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WERE BORN AND RAISED IN THIS AREA WHO WERE YOU KNOW GREW UP IN THE INDUSTRY WHO HAS SPENT OF A CAREER IN THE INDUSTRY ONLY TO FIND THEMSELVES HAVING TO RE LOCATE IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THOSE JOBS- AS A RESULT OF THE OF THE PROGRAM. RIGHT WE SEE THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE COME BACK. I SAW PEOPLE WHO OF WHO IT APPROVING THEMSELVES MOVED TO SAY GEORGIA LOUISIANA AND THEN CAME BACK AND- YEAH I'M I'M ASSUMING THESE ARE PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO A RE REGISTER THEIR VEHICLES YET AND GET THEY GET THE PROPER LICENSE PLATE ON THEM. ON THEIR CAR RIGHT- BUT WE KNOW WE SEEN WAS IN THE ROOM A REAL RESISTANT YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST HEART BREAKING THINGS. ARE THE THAT I WENT THROUGH ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. WAS PRIOR TO. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ACTION TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THE AXIS OF THE WORKERS FROM THIS AREA. LEAVING CALIFORNIA LEAVING BEHIND THEIR HOMES. AND HAVING TO RELOCATE TO A PLACE IT NEVER BEEN BEFORE RIGHT THEY WEREN'T FROM THOSE AREAS NOT LIKE THEY'RE GOING BACK HOME THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE UPROOTED HERE HAVE THEIR FAMILIES HERE HAVING TO FOLLOW THE WORK AND THEN. COMING TO THEIR UNION. ASKING FOR A WHAT WE CALL A CAR TRANSFERRED NO GOING TRANSFER MY MEMBERSHIP FROM LOS ANGELES. TO LOUISIANA ARE TO GEORGIA OR WHEREVER YOU KNOW THE HOTTEST PLACE WAS AT THAT TIME. AND LISTEN TO THE STORIES IT WAS THE- JUST ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING. PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HAVING TO- THE OTHER KIDS HAVING TO LEAVE THE GRANDPARENTS. RIGHT OR IN SOME CASES A LOT OF CASES ONE OF THE- WILL SOMEBODY LEAVING HAVING TO LEAVE THE AREA AND TALKING ABOUT THE PLANS OF BRINGING THEIR SPOUSE AT A LATER DATE. RIGHT SO. WHEN WE SAW THIS TURN AROUND AND WE SAW THESE PEOPLE RETURNING. IT WAS PROBABLY ONE IT HAD OF BEEN THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW IT NEW WE KNEW WE HAD IT RIGHT. RIGHT WAS SOMEBODY COMES HOME. EN EN AND THEN THEY THEY TALK TO YOU ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE THERE AND HOW HAPPY THEY ARE TO BE HOME. THEN ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS. THAT'S WHAT MADE IT WORTH. RIGHT THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. YEAH SORRY I DIDN'T THINK OF SAYING THIS BEFORE BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOU TOM. BEING IN A LEADERSHIP POSITION IS DIFFICULT AS IS BUT HAVING TO OF WEATHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A LOT OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP WITH DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE SHIP DURING THAT TIME TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW TO WHERE THE INDUSTRY IS NOW I DO COMMENDED AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK THE CIVIC CLEAR. SPECIFIC TO THE QUESTION ABOUT GEORGIA AND YOU MENTIONED PERMITTING- WE DON'T HAVE PERMIT LEVEL DATA TO COMPARE ONE REGION AGAINST ANOTHER WHEN IT COMES TO THAT HOWEVER WE DO TRACK- SEGMENTS OF THE INDUSTRY WE LOOK AT THE TELEVISION PRODUCTION LANDSCAPE WE LOOK AT THE FEATURES PRODUCTION LANDSCAPE AND FAMILY WILL HAVE A REPORT COMING UP NEXT WEEK THAT IS- SNAPSHOT FEATURE PRODUCTION OVER. A YEAR'S WORTH OF TIME AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS WE FOUND IN THIS STUDY I'M GETTING A LITTLE AWAY BUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE PERMANENTLY LOCKED INTO A COMPETITION WITH A HANDFUL OF HIGHLY RESOURCE COMPETITORS CALIFORNIA IS UP AGAINST THE U. K. THE STATE OF GEORGIA STATE OF NEW YORK AND- THE CANADIAN PROVINCES BECAUSE ALL ARE ATTRACTING LARGE VOLUMES OF PRODUCTION TO THEIR AREAS- WHEN YOU LOOK AT FEATURE FILM PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA LOOKS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IF YOU LOOK AT. INDEPENDENT PROJECTS THAT HAVE A NATURAL INCENTIVE TO BE ANYWAY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT. THE RETURNS FROM THE CALIFORNIA FILM AND TV TAX CREDIT THOSE FEATURES THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THAT PROGRAM- WE LOOK PRETTY GOOD UNDER. THE OVERALL PICTURE. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE JUST THE TOP GROSSING US DOMESTIC FEATURES WE FALL FROM FIRST PLACE TO FOURTH. BECAUSE THE KINDS OF PROJECTS WERE ABLE TO ATTRACT IN A NUMBER OF THEM THAT WERE ABLE TO ATTRACT- WITH THE PROGRAM IS IT IS JUST LEAVES US IN THAT MIDDLING POSITION. SO THESE COMPETITORS ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP- AND THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THE CALIFORNIA FACE. I'M NOT A DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS BUT A PERMANENT LEVEL OF COMPETITION SO IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT THIS PROGRAM HERE THAT IT BE IN PLACE- IT'S FORTY PERCENT. OF AREA TELEVISION PRODUCTION POWERED BY THIS PROGRAM IT'S 13% OF AREA FUTURE PRODUCTION. POWERED BY THIS PROGRAM. SO AS LONG AS THE COMPETITION CONTINUES TO COVER THIS BUSINESS- IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK DILIGENTLY EVERYDAY TO PROTECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHERMAN I'M GETTING A SIGN AND WE NEED TO- TO WRAP UP THIS PIANO BUT I DO WANT TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENT THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR- SHIP ON HELPING TO KEEP JOBS HERE IN LOS ANGELES TO TURN THE INDUSTRY AROUND EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING FOR OUR COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO WE ARE NOW GOING TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TRANSITION TO OUR- OUR SECOND PANEL HERE WHICH IS ABOUT THE- CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FACING THE INDUSTRY. LUCKY TO HAVE A SIMILARLY DISTINGUISHED GROUP OF PANELISTS HERE WITH US- SO GIVE THEM A MINUTE TO GET SET UP BUT JUST A PREVIEW WE HAVE- MELISSA PATAK THE VICE PRESIDENT SENIOR COUNSEL FROM- MPA.

DOES DOUBLE DUTY ON BEHALF OF OUR BUSINESS OUR INDUSTRY AND ALL THE- EVERYBODY WHO DERIVE. THEIR LIVELIHOOD FROM IT SO WE JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT AS WELL. OKAY SO I HAD HOPED TO HAVE A POWER POINT- CAPABILITY HERE TO WALK YOU THROUGH- LITTLE DOCUMENT A LITTLE DEAF CALLED PRODUCTION SPENDING TRENDS I'VE MADE. ON THE FM WAS. GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COPIES SO THE LEGISLATORS COULD ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COULD LOOK ONLINE THAT'S IT I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH IT IT'S NOT IN COLOR I'M GOING TO SEND IT. BY EMAIL ON AFTER THE HEARING TO YOUR STAFF ASSEMBLY MEMBER- GABRIEL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE IT ON- YOU KNOW FOR THE RECORD SO BUT IT'S TIME JUST CAN TAKE A FEW MINUTES. TO WALK YOU THROUGH THAT IT TELLS YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH PRODUCTION. BOB SO FIRST FOR THE MPA AT YOU ALL KNOW WE ARE AYE WE REPRESENT THE LEADING PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF MOTION PICTURES AND TELEVISION PRO PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS. FROM THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURES TO BROADCAST CABLE. SATELLITE AND NOW OF COURSE STREAMING SERVICES. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE POWER POINT ON. AT IT SHOWS YOU WITH THE TREND OVER STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWO ALL THE WAY UP TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND YOU CAN SEE. THAT THE AMOUNT OF SCRIPTED TV SERIES WE'RE NOW AT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SCRIPTED TV SERIES BEING PRODUCED- REALLY ARE- THROUGHOUT. THE WORLD THAT ARE BEING AIRED ON VARIOUS NETWORKS. I'M THIS TELLS YOU LIKE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO AND YOU CAN SEE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WOULD FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SIX THE INTERESTING THING IS TO NOTE. WHERE ARE THEY BEING DISTRIBUTED HOW ARE PEOPLE SEEING THEM SO BY THE BOTTOM BAR AGAIN IT'S A BLUE BAR YOU CAN'T SEE IT IS IT IS ON THE TWO THOUSAND TWO IT SAYS THIRTY. AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT SAYS A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THAT IS- OUR BASIC CABLE. OKAY AND BASIC CABLE IS LIKE SCI FI- TNT FREEFORM NICKELODEON AND ALL OF THOSE NETWORKS. OUGHT THAT THE NEXT BAND IS THE RED BAND AND THAT'S PAY CABLE- THAT'S LIKE HBO AND SHOWTIME AND THOSE TYPE OF CABLE I NETWORKS. SO IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. WE HAD SEVENTEEN OF THOSE AND IN OUR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WERE UP TO FORTY FIVE. SO YOU CAN SEE THE GROWTH IN THAT AREA. THE NEXT BAND IS THE GREEN BAND THAT'S THE MORE TRADITIONAL BROADCAST TV. I AND WERE ON. THAT SORT OF A MOVING A LITTLE BIT IT WAS A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO- BUT WE HAD NO STREAMING IN TWO THOUSAND TWO ON IT DECLINES IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO ONE SIXTEEN. WHAT'S BACK UP TO ONE FORTY SIX I AM BROADCAST TRADITIONAL BROADCAST IS AS YOU KNOW ABC CBS NBC- FOX AND THE CW SO FIVE NETWORKS THEN THE TOP BAND IS THE PURPLE BAND. I AND YOU SEE IT DIDN'T EXIST IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THAT IS OUR STREAMING SERVICES- SO THAT IS NETFLIX HULU CBS ALL ACCESS- AND AMAZON PRIME AND TO THAT CAME ON IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S GONE FROM- YOU KNOW A MINUSCULE NUMBER IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO NOW A HUNDRED AND SIXTY. SERIES BEING PRODUCED DIRECTLY FOR THE STREAMING SERVICES SAID THESE NUMBERS JUST FOR U. S. BROADCASTS AND VIEWING OR IS THIS INCLUDING. PRODUCTION FROM INDIA THAT WE NEVER SEE YOUR AROUND RIGHT WORLD RIGHT SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS. I THINK IT'S U. S. OKAY US PERFECT U. S. RIGHT IT'S ART YES FOR OUR AND NOW SOME OF OUR U. S. OR SEEN GLOBALLY NETFLIX YOU CAN SUBSCRIBE TO GLOBALLY BUT THESE ARE OUR U. S. PRODUCTIONS OKAY AND ARE FOOTNOTE SAYS THAT IF YOU INCLUDED THE UNSCRIPTED SERIES WE WOULD BE AT ONE THOUSAND. SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY. OKAY OKAY SO IF YOU GO TO THE SECOND PAGE ON THIS IS A BAR GRAPH. AND IT SHOWS YOU THE PROJECTION THAT WE BELIEVE THAT- BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO JUST TWO YEARS FROM NOW. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A 20% INCREASE IN WILL BE AT SIX HUNDRED SCRIPTED TV SERIES. ARE AND SO THAT'S REALLY A TREMENDOUS. TREMENDOUS GROWTH. ARE THAT WE CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE. BOB AND THEN FEATURE FILMS ALSO EXPERIENCING GROWTH THAT'S THE NEXT PAGE IF YOU FLIP TO THE NEXT. OUR BAR GRAPH THAT SHOWS YOU THE NUMBER OF FEATURE- ORIGINAL FEATURES FOR STREAMING SERVICES OKAY. SO AGAIN WE EXPECT THAT NUMBER. TO REACH OVER A HUNDRED BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO THE NEXT CHART I THE NEXT SLIDE. TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING WITH STREAMING SERVICES SO IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE ADDED- DISNEY PLUS AN APPLE TV AND THOSE ARE TWO NEW STREAMING SERVICES AND THEY ARE PRODUCING ORIGINAL CONTENT JUST FOR THOSE SERVICES AND SHORTLY DURING THIS YEAR WE EXPECT OUR NBC UNIVERSAL'S A STREAMING SERVICE CALLED PEACOCK ON HBO MAX WHICH IS WATER MEDIA STREAMING SERVICE AND THEY WILL COME ON LINE LATER THIS YEAR. AND THEN QUIT BE. WHICH ARE IS KIND OF A- ACRONYM OR SHORT FORM FOR QUICK BITES THAT IS THE NEW COMPANY ART STARTED BY JEFFREY KATZENBERG AND MEG WHITMAN AND THEY'RE PRODUCING SHORT FORM. SCRIPTED CONTENT IT WILL HAVE JOBS JUST LIKE OF A FEATURE FILM THE SAME KINDS OF CAST AND CREW WILL PRODUCE THOSE ARE BUT IN TEN MINUTE SEGMENTS FOR YOUR MOBILE PHONE. ON PROBABLY GOOD FOR MY KIDS MAYBE NOT SO MUCH FOR A NOT YOU KNOW AN OLDER GENERATION BUT THIS IS HOW PEOPLE WANT THEIR CONTENT IF YOU'RE COMMUTING IF YOU ARE- WAITING IN LINE YOU KNOW SOME PLACE YOU CAN CATCH A TEN MINUTE EPISODE SO THAT IS EXPECTED TO COME ONLINE IN JUST A FEW WEEKS. AND AGAIN WE'LL OP PRODUCE LOTS MORE- ODD LOTS MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE PRODUCTION THE LAST SLIDE I TELL YOU HOW MUCH IS BEING SPENT AND THIS IS AN ESTIMATE- THE MPA. HAS CALCULATED TWENTY BILLION IN TWENTY EIGHT AND THIS IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN NUMBERS TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS SPENT BY THE TRADITIONAL SERVICES AND EIGHTEEN BILLION BY THE STREAMING SERVICES THIRTY EIGHT BILLION. AND THIS IS WHERE WE TAKE A FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE VIEW BUT VARIETY LAST RECENTLY AN ARTICLE ON IN JANUARY AND THEY SAID ACTUAL AMOUNT SPENT IN TWENTY NINETEEN BASED ON THEIR RESEARCH WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN. ORIGINAL CONTENT OBVIOUSLY BIG DIFF BUT SO WE EAT A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S THAT IS SPENT ON PRODUCTION. AND WHAT IS THE MEAN THOUGH IT MEAN AT I'M- THAT I'M PRESIDENT OPPORTUNITY TO GROW AND EXPAND THE GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AS WELL AS THE BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION. WE DO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AS THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE SPOKEN TO OPT FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS IT'S PROVIDED A STABLE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION. DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN GOOD QUALITY FILM AND TELEVISION SERIES. OUGHT BUT THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION IS NOW EXPLODING ON WITH TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS GROWTH. A PRODUCTION TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT REMAIN STABLE WON'T ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO CAPTURE ITS FAIR SHARE OF THE PRODUCTION BOOM AND WE KNOW THOSE PRODUCTIONS OUR JOBS. JOBS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO APPEAR IN FRONT OF A CAMERA MY COLLEAGUE KERRY WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT FOR SAG AFTERS MEMBERS THE ACTORS AND OF COURSE FOR THE BELOW THE LINE UP BEHIND THE CAMERA- CREW MEMBERS DOES A REALLY GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. THE OPPORTUNITY MEANS FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY TO CREATE MORE JOBS AND GROW GROW OUR OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THE PANELISTS AND THEN WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS BUT IT IS I WILL JUST SAY MISTER TACK YOU WERE.

TO OUR MEMBERS THAT THEY WORK WHERE THEY LIVE JUST LIKE ALL OF YOU- WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO FIRST START OUT WITH THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US FOR OUR UNION AND FOR OUR MEMBERS TO. HAVE WORK HERE IN THE VALLEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN OUR LAST NEGOTIATIONS I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- TRAVEL EXPENSES- ARE GETTING LESS AND LESS AND LESS FOR OUR MEMBERS OF THE- BECOMING A LOT HARDER TO NEGOTIATE. IF THEY HAVE TO GO FILM PRODUCTION IN GEORGIA WHICH IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT THEY CAN'T TURN IT DOWN ITS WORK. IF TO PAY TO GET THERE. HAVE TO PUT PAY TO FLY HOME TO SEE THEIR KIDS. TO GET AN APARTMENT THESE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE THINGS THAT THEY'RE INCURRING THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED. IN THEIR PAY SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST VERY IMPORTANT. TO OUR MEMBERS THAT THERE ARE. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S DIRECTLY TIED TO THE TAXES THAT ARE PROGRAM. I'M WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS.

BEING PRODUCED ALL THE TIME BY NETFLIX I MEAN SO ARE UNION WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH. THE AMOUNT OF CON ALL CONTENT OUT THERE THAT. WILL HELP WE CAN GET RESIDUALS FOR OUR MEMBERS. YOU KNOW WRITTEN INTO THE CONTRACT IT'S VERY IT IT'S BEEN A VERY BIG. TIME FOR THE UNION TO KEEP UP WITH THE STREAMING IN THE IN THE WHO LOSE IN THE NETFLIX BUT WE DO HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT NOW WITH NETFLIX WHICH WERE VERY PROUD OF- THAT WAS A BIG THING THAT WE DID- JUST THIS PAST YEAR- SO.

ITS WE ALL KNOW THAT THE FILM INDUSTRY IS CHANGING WITH THE EXPANSION OF DISTRIBUTION PLATFORMS AND A GROWING GLOBAL MARKET AND IT'S MELISSA TALKED ABOUT THE- INCREASES IN SCRIPTED SERIES. THEY'RE ALSO BEEN AN INCREASE IN A FEATURE FILMS- FROM SEVENTY ALL CLOSE SEVENTY FOUR FIVE HUNDRED AND 200-014-8200 AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. OF THE INCREASE IN PRODUCTION MEANS MORE SOUND STAGES MORE POST PRODUCTION FACILITIES- AND IT REALLY ALLOWS US TO FOSTER A SKILLED WORK FORCE- AND IT MEANS A LOT FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY. I COMPETITION AMONG CONTENT CREATORS MEET TO MEET GROWING DEMAND I HAS CREATED ADDITIONAL COST PRESSURES OF THE STUDIOS ARE PRODUCING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE IN CONTENT. IN LEFT TO MOUNT OF TIME. PRODUCTIONS ARE COMPETING FOR WORKERS TALENT AND SOUND STAGE SPACE- PRODUCTIVE AND THEN SPUR JOB. PRODUCTION INCENTIVES ARE KEY TO DETERMINING WHERE FEATURE FILMS. CALIFORNIA OTHER NINETY SEVEN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS GLOBALLY WITH THIRTY FOUR IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE AND THESE OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE COMMITTED TO ATTRACTING- PRODUCTION TO THEIR JURISDICTIONS AND WE WANT TO KEEP THEM. IN OURS- THE BILL FROM THEM PRESS OF MULTI STAGE FACILITIES AND INSTITUTED JOB TRAINING PROGRAM THIS WELL- THOSE ARE ALL BENEFITS THAT WE WANT TO KEEP HERE YOU KNOW IF WE COULD- WE KEEP. ALL PRODUCTION AND AN ALLY- THERE WAS WE HAD- AS US SENATOR DEBBIE STABENOW FROM FISHING AND COME OUT TO SPEAK TO OUR MEMBERS ONE TIME AND- STEPHEN THIS AND- FORMALLY WITH NBC UNIVERSAL WAS TALKING TO HER.

AND YEAH IT WAS VERY EYE OPENING FOR ME AND THIS JOB TO REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY- YEAH. THESE COMPANIES ARE BUSINESSES AND THEY HAVE TO MAKE MONEY AND IF WE ARE GIVING THEM THE INCENTIVES TO STAY IN LA TO PRODUCE JOBS IN LA THEY'RE GOING TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND I AM NO PRESSURE BUT THAT'S REALLY ALL ON. YOUR LAP. SO YEAH. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMIT- AND INTO MORE- WE'RE EXPECTING PRODUCTION AND CONTINUE TO GROW AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS A MEASURES TO INCREASE FUNDING. TO THE CALIFORNIA REALLY CAN COMPETE IN THE MARKET PLACE FOR STUDENTS THE US MINT JOB CREATION AND- ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE AUDIO WELL SECOND. IT'S AN OPPORTUNE STRING IN CALIFORNIA FORCED BY PLANE. FOCUS ON FOR BELOW LINES. I COMPETITOR CAL PRODUCTION TACK CREDIT WILL STRENGTHEN OUR HOLY. RETAIN AND EXPANDING PAYING JOBS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOUSANDS OF BALLOT RESIDENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN THE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL OF OUR- AT. THAT A OPEN AND TO QUESTIONS FOR MY CALL IF ANY. HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. CELEBRITIES I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THAT A QUESTION FOR MELISSA. YOUR LAST SLIDE SHOWS IS TWENTY BILLION FOR TRADITIONAL SERVICES AND- EIGHTEEN BILLION BEING SPENT ON ONLINE- DO YOU EXPECT IT TO SHIFT TO WITH THE MAJORITY BEING ONLINE ENTERED WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN YOUR RESTAURANT THE TRENDS RIGHT SO YES IT IS- IN FACT I- I THINK OUR ESTIMATE FOR TWENTY NINETEEN ON THE ONLINE SIDE. IS THIRTY BILLION- I DIDN'T I HAD THAT IN MY STATEMENT I DIDN'T- BUT IT'S NOT ON THIS RIGHT NOW SO IT'S THIRTY EIGHT BILLION IN TOTAL TOWARD TWENTY BILLION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TRADITIONAL SERVICES IN EIGHTEEN BILLION WE THINK THAT WILL EVENTUALLY IF NOT ALREADY IN TWENTY NINETEEN SIR PASS WHERE THEY'LL BE MORE SPENT. ON ONLINE THAN THAN IN TRADITIONAL BUT BUT THOSE TRADITIONAL IS ARE NOT GOING AWAY YOU KNOW TO A TNT NICKELODEON ALL OF THOSE CABLE CHANNELS THEY'RE NOT GOING AWAY EITHER ON AND NOT EVERYBODY'S YOU KNOW WHILE. THERE'S TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR ONLINE SERVICES PEOPLE ARE STILL TURNING ON THE TRADITIONAL TV SO THERE WILL STILL BE ON CONTENT CREATED FOR THE BROADCAST WORLD AND FOR THE CABLE WORLD BUT YES ONLINE IS- IS GROWING SO SINCE ONLINE IS GROWING IS OUR REGION SET UP. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT REMAINING HERE IN YOUR OPINION OR WHAT WELL THAT'S IT YOU KNOW THE PIE IS BIGGER RIGHT THE PIE OF PRODUCTION IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT SPENDING ON PRODUCTION IS IT IT IS. GROWING AND WE EXPECT AS AS NOTED THAT IT'S GOING TO GET BIGGER SO BOB IF YOU SAY. ARE SLICE OF THE PIE REPRESENTED BY OUR PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT WHICH AGAIN IS A GOOD TAX CREDIT AND IT'S BEEN PRIOR TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW THAT RESTORED US AND NOW CALIFORNIA IS ON THE MAP TO CHOOSE CALIFORNIA BUT IF THAT PIE IS BIGGER BUT YOU'RE SLICE IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONLY IN. RIGHT REPRESENTED THEN YOUR SLICES ACTUALLY SMALLER THAN BECAUSE IT'S A NOW A BIGGER PIE. SO I YOU KNOW PRODUCTIONS NEED. CERTAINTY AND STABILITY AND KNOWLEDGE THAT THOSE THE INCENTIVE IS AVAILABLE- AND IF NOT THERE ARE MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT ARE COMPETING FOR THIS BUSINESS SO- I CAN'T GIVE YOU IT'S NOT EASY YES OR NO QUESTION BUT- I THINK WE CAN. PUT THE FACTS ON THE TABLE AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THE TRENDS ARE. AND THERE WERE LAST YEAR ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN PROJECTS THAT DIDN'T GET THE TAX CREDIT THAT LEFT THE STATE- EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION WENT TO GEORGIA THREE THIRTY MILLION WENT TO NEW MEXICO. HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION WENT TO NEW YORK AND A HUNDRED TEN MILLION WENT TO LOUISIANA SO THAT'S MONEY IN THE ECONOMY AND JOBS THAT WE DIDN'T GET. AND NOT A DATA IS FROM THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSIONS PROGRESS REPORT BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO TRACK- PRODUCTIONS THAT DIDN'T GET INTO THE PROGRAM AND THEN FOLLOWED WITH A WHITE SHINS THAT THE RAP THAT WERE SUBMITTED. AND THEN DID BECAUSE SO AGAIN IT'S A YOU KNOW AS IT'S BEEN SAID EVERYBODY WANTS TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY GET MORE APPLICATIONS THAN. THE THAN CAN BE SATISFIED AND SO THE FILM COMMISSION IS DONE A PRETTY A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF BEING ABLE TO SAY OKAY WOULD BE. TELL A PRODUCTION SORRY WE CAN'T ACCOMMODATE YOU THEN THEY FOR STAY IN TOUCH WITH THE DESERT YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FILLED OUT THE APPLICATION TO FIND OUT WHAT WHERE DID YOU DECIDE TO GO. PRESIDENT AND- SO THANK YOU SO I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WHAT WAS- YOU KNOW WE HEARD SOME CONVERSATION EARLIER ABOUT- ISSUES RELATED TO DIVERSITY IN THE INDUSTRY- I THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT YOU KNOW IT'S THE VIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN THIS INDUSTRY WHICH WERE WERE HAPPY AND PROUD TO DO BUT THAT THE BENEFITS OF THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT SHOULD FLOW TO ALL THE COMMUNITIES HERE CALIFORNIANS I WANT TO. JUST GET A APART FROM ANYBODY ON THE PANEL ABOUT SORT OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE UNDERTOOK IN RELATION TO THE LACK TROUT LAST ROUND OF TAX CREDITS AND WHERE WHERE YOU SEE THAT GOING IN YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER WORK MIGHT NEED TO BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT. DID THE DID THE JOB THE ROBBIE TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN YOUR CALIFORNIA REFLECT THE DIVERSITY THE STATE. SO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT SO TOM ALL I SPOKE ABOUT THE TIME DAVIS SPOKE ABOUT THIS IN HIS PRESENTATION SO WE HAVE A- A CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAM EVERY PRODUCTION THAT BOB. GETS ACCEPTED INTO THE- TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. BEGINNING ON JULY ONE OUT WILL MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO A CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAM AND THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE ADMINISTERED BY A TRAINING TRUST FUND THE IATSE TRAINING TRUST FUND. AND THAT TRUST FUND WILL BE PARTNERING WITH- ORGANIZATIONS NON PROFITS THAT SERVE ARE UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND TO CREATE A PIPELINE FROM THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE INTO THE I A TRADING TRUST FUND WHERE THEY WILL BE TRAINED. FOR A NUMBER OF CLASSIFICATIONS IN WHAT WE CALL THE BELOW THE LINE JOBS AND BEHIND THE CAMERAS WHETHER SECOND STRUCTURE AND- ON HAIR AND MAKEUP OUGHT A NUMBER OF THOSE- POSITIONS AND THEY'LL BE MENTORED. BY COUNTERPARTS MORE VETERAN MEMBERS OF THOSE UNIONS TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET PLACED INTO POSITIONS AND THAT THEY UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INDUSTRY IF YOU MAKE THE DECISION TO GET IN HERE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIVING WITH SOME UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE YOU. YOU HAVE HAVE EMPLOYMENT THE LEFT THE- THAT THAT PROJECT IS WRAPPED AND THERE'S A PERIOD OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND BUT YOU TO BUILD REAL IF FOR ONE. YEAR WELL SKILLED AND YOU HAVE QUALITY WORK AND YOU MAKE THE RELATIONSHIPS THEN YOU'LL GET CALLED FOR THE NEXT PROJECT AS THE TEAM GETS ASSEMBLED AND SO BUT THOSE ARE NOT SKILLS THAT COME NATURALLY TO MANY PEOPLE SO. ON THIS PROGRAM WE EXPECTED AND OUR HOPE IS THAT WE CREATE MENTORSHIPS AND- A PIPELINE FOR PEOPLE TO GAIN A CAREER NOT JUST A ONE TIME PLACEMENT ON IT IN A JOB AND SO WERE. ON YOU KNOW WE'RE HOPEFUL AND WE'RE GOING TO GET ALL THE ATTENTION TO MAKE SURE IT'S NURTURED PROPERLY- ANNA WE HOPE BUT- A YEAR FROM NOW OR TWO YEARS NOW THAT WE HAVE- SOME GOOD. SUCCESS STORIES TO SHARE WITH YOU GREAT GREAT WE LOOK FOR TEARING THEM DID YOU WANT TO YEAH I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT SAID AFTER WE HAVE A DIVERSITY. INCLUSION PROGRAM WE'RE HAVE COMMITTEE TO THIS ENDEAVOR- ON SCREEN AND OFF YOU KNOW AS A MEMBER ORGANIZATION- WE IT'S OUR PREFERENCE THAT ALL HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND MEMBERS ARE WORKING ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE- WANT EVERYBODY TO JOIN THE UNION THERE ARE NO- SO FOR US I MEAN WE PROMOTE DIVERSITY INCLUSION. HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE CAN I JUST WANT ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE WERE.

I'LL STICK UNDER SIXTY SECONDS MY NAME IS JEFFREY DOUGLAS I'M THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF THE FREE SPEECH COALITION THAT'S THE TRADE ASSOCIATION OF THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. IS LISTENING TO EVERYONE TALK. ALL THE FACTORS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IMPACT THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY ONLY ON A GREATER MAGNITUDE. THE INDUSTRY IS NOT RECOGNIZED FOR ITS INNOVATION IN THIS JOB. EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE DOING FOR ENTERTAINMENT NEEDS TO INCLUDE THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY BECAUSE THE JOBS ARE FLEEING AND THE PERFORMERS AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS FALLING AS WELL THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL I'M A CONSTITUENT OF YOUR DISTRICT- I WANTED TO COME UP TO MENTION AGAIN KIND OF GOING OFF OF WHAT'S SEWER MENTIONED HERE- AB FIVE THE SOMETHING THAT GENERALLY IS GOOD I THINK AS FAR AS LABORS ARE CONCERNED. I IS VERY HELPFUL FOR A LOT OF THE GUILDS AND- UNIONS OUT HERE HOWEVER I THINK- THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO EXPAND THAT UMBRELLA I. INDIVIDUAL CONTENT CREATORS PRODUCTION LINES TALKING ABOUT YOU TO TWITCH EVERYTHING THAT IS CREATED NOWADAYS ONLINE IS REALLY CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE AS IT WERE. OF EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY THIS INCLUDES THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE.

I KNOW SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE CONSIDERED UNDER AB FIVE I EMPLOYEES OF THE STREAMING SERVICES IT'S UNCLEAR FROM LEGISLATORS AND- ARE THE ATTORNEYS- WHETHER THOSE WOULD BE INCLUDED AS EMPLOYEES. I SUSPECT ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS IN THE DOG INDUSTRY OUR WATER SEEN COMPANIES JUST BLOCK PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO STREAM CALIFORNIA ALREADY THIS YEAR.

ACOSTA EXEMPTION THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED- RECENTLY WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW GIVE.

AN AGENT TO KEEP YOUR NAME SAFE ALSO REALLY TALKING ABOUT A FULL EXEMPTIONS HERE FOR ALL PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY. SO THANK YOU AB SO THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S DAVID IS ALSO WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT COMMERCIAL PRODUCERS. 85% OF OUR NATIONAL AIR COMMERCIALS ARE PRODUCED BY OUR MEMBER COMPANIES 60% OF WHICH ARE. BASED HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT INCREASINGLY OUR PRODUCTION IS GOING ELSEWHERE. AND WE- THE WAIT COMMERCIALS ARE PRODUCED AS WITH THE SAME KIND OF STAFF AND CREW AND CAST THAT. FEATURE FILMS AND TV SHOWS ARE PRODUCED INCLUDING THE SAME UNIONS REPRESENTING THOSE WORKERS. I TWENTY SEVEN US STATES OFFER INCENTIVES FOR COMMERCIAL REDUCTION RECOGNIZING THEIR ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL. IMPACT IN COMMUNITIES AND SO WE URGE YOU AS YOU CONSIDER OPERATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR. INCREASING THE SHARE OF- PRODUCTION STAYING HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT YOU CONSIDER. BRINGING COMMERCIAL PRODUCTIONS INTO THAT. BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES THAN EVER FOR ADVERTISERS TO REACH CONSUMERS IN MOVING IMAGES WHETHER BE DIGITAL BILLBOARDS. STREAMING IN SOCIAL MEDIA OR TRADITIONAL BROADCAST SO PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI I'M MICHELLE OF LONGER AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FREE SPEECH COALITION DID TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY I WANTED TO ADDRESS. WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE A GAP IN YOUR ECONOMIC AND INCENTIVES OUT THE LOWER AND THE- THRESHOLD IS A MILLION DOLLARS. FOR YOUR TAX CREDITS AND THAT LEAVES OUT IN MAINSTREAM ENTERTAINMENT AND ADULT ENTERTAINMENT. THE VERY LARGE GROWING POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SELF PRODUCING CONTENT AND THEIR- AS KERRY MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION FOR WORK THERE'S A LOT OF ACTORS PRODUCERS. OTHER PEOPLE NOT WORKING SO THEY'RE PRODUCING THEIR OWN CONTENT BECAUSE- THEY ARE DRIVEN TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK AND THEY ARE NOW BEING FOR THEIR BURDEN BIKE. AB FIVE IN THE ADULT INDUSTRY AB TWO THREE EIGHT NINE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE THEIR CONTENT AND THEN THERE'S NO ON THE OTHER SIDE. ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC INCENTIVE AND SO THAT'S A LEAVING OUT A LOT OF. VERY SMALL SELF PRODUCED CONTENT AND EVEN SOME MORE MEDIUM SIZED PRODUCERS AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO EVERYONE FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT. I THINK WE ALL DO TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM EVERYONE IN THE INDUSTRY FROM DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINTS AND FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ABOUT HOW- THE WORK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY IMPACTS YOU SO.
