ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. ON INCREASING ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND SERVICES IN RESPONSE TO THE OPIOID CRISIS OF A WELCOME EVERYONE HERE. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK -- CHAIR WOULD HAVE. FOR BEING HERE AS WELL I JUST WANTED -- IF YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE HOLDING THESE HEARINGS BECAUSE THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC CONTINUES THE FACT THIS NATION IN CALIFORNIA AND WHILE CERTAINLY THE OVERALL RATE OF OPIATE RELATED DEATHS. OVERDOSE DEATHS IS LOWERED IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE AREAS WITHIN OUR STATE WHERE RATES ARE FIVE TIMES HIGHEST THE STATE AVERAGE AND PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM THIS -- THESE HIGH RATES ARE EVEN MORE CONCERNING BECAUSE THE STATE THE STATS ARE HAPPENING IN REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT OFTEN LACK ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE VERTICALLY SPECIALLY SERVICES. AND OF THIS YOU SERVICES. SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WELL ALL STE AREAS OF THE STATE ARE AFFECTED EVEN LARGE URBAN AREAS THAT TRADITIONALLY MORE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND SOCIAL SERVICES AS WELL. AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT -- THE SURGEON GENERAL DR DRUM ADAMS WAS MADE -- THE OPIOID CRISIS CERTAINLY A PRIORITY -- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- AS WELL AND WE WE NEED TO THINK TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. OUT HERE IN THIS STATE WE'VE TAKEN ON TWO PROJECTS THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE CALIFORNIA HUB AND SPOKE SYSTEM. AND WE'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THOSE AND THEY'RE HELPING TO IMPROVE SERVICE COORDINATION INTEGRATION. AND HOPEFULLY ALSO INCREASE SERVICES AND A ROLL REGIONS BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE CHALLENGES AS I MENTIONED THE ROLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SOME OF THESE PROJECTS TO RELY ON GRANTS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAIVERS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS PARTNERS WITH US. AND AND SOLVING THIS CRISIS SO WE MUST EXPLORE ALL THESE PROJECTS AND DISCUSS WHAT WE CAN DO THE STATE AND THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH MANY OF THE FACT THAT THESE STAKEHOLDERS. FISHER WE SUSTAIN THESE IMPORTANT LIFESAVING SERVICES AND BE SURE THAT THEY REACHED THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. SO -- YEAH I'M LOOKING VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR OUR SPEAKERS TODAY AGAIN SHARE THEIR INSIGHTS AND THEIR EXPERTISE WITH US. WE THINK ABOUT OUR POLICIES THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD -- I KNOW THAT A LOT OF TIMES WE HAVE A LOT OF PILOTS IN THE STATE -- BUT THIS CRISIS SUCH IT'S TIME TO MOVE FROM PILOT STAGE TO SCALE SO AGAIN I WANT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I AND I WANT INVITES US -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIR -- DOCTOR WOULD CHAIR OF THE CELL. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PAN -- FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND NOT ALLOWING US TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS -- ALSO THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE TODAY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THAT WILL HELP SHAPE THE FUTURE THIS ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS MANY YOU KNOW I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE BEEN WORKING ON THIS SINCE THE DAY I GOT HERE. I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT HAS BEEN HARD HIT BY THE OPIOID CRISIS -- SOME EVEN MIGHT SAY DISPROPORTIONATELY. THE MOSTLY RURAL AREA I REPRESENT -- HAS MANY NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES AND I WAS ASTOUNDED TO RECENTLY LEARNED THAT THE OPIATE OVERDOSE RATE AMONG NATIVE AMERICANS IS MORE THAN TWICE THE DEATH RATE AND MORE THAN THREE TIMES -- THE FOR FOR FOR WHITES AND MORE THAN THREE TIMES OUT OF CALIFORNIANS IN GENERAL. THE PAST THREE YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD ON THIS ISSUE WE HAVE SOME SCENES A MAJOR PROGRESS PRESCRIPTIONS YOU ISSUES IN AT THE IN CALIFORNIA THE END OF TWO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN NUMBER ABOUT TWENTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION. THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS NINETEEN POINT NINE MILLION FOUR AND A HALF MILLION LOWER THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST -- IN THE LAST PAST THREE YEARS EMERGENCY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY VISITS AN OVERDOSE RECOVERY DRUGS ARE BEING PRESCRIBED INDUSTRY DISTRIBUTED AT EVER INCREASING RATES. THE COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO DO TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS HAS BEEN REMARKABLE STILL. WE HAVE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT WENT OUT. MOST ALARMING TO ME IS THAT THE DEATHS RELATED TO FENTON NOW INCREASED BY 81% IN ONE YEAR. AN UNFORTUNATE SUSPECT WE'VE NOT SEEN THE END OF THE RISE IN DEATHS RELATED TO VOTE NO. SO WHAT THE EFFORT HAS BEEN FOCUSED WE'RE SEEING MUCH PROGRESS MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE. TODAY TODAY WE WILL BE LEARNING ABOUT THE EFFORTS UNDER WAY THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE STATE AS WELL EXAMINE. HOW WE CAN INCREASE ACCESS TO OPIOID USE DISORDER TREATMENT? AND SERVICES FOR OUR RESIDENTS AND HOW THOSE SERVICES CAN BE IMPROVED X. EXPANDED AND ENHANCED THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO OUR AGENDA TODAY. THANK YOU TO RELAX SO WHAT NOW WHAT THANK YOU AND RECOGNIZE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS ISSUE IS -- WE'VE MADE THE PROGRESS THAT YOU CITED BUT AS YOU'VE ALSO NOTED THAT NUMBER THAT'S CONTINUES TO RISE. SO LET'S BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PANEL AT WHICH IN OUR VIEW THE PILOT PROJECTS AND EVALUATIONS AND HOPEFULLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PILOT PROJECTS IN VALUATIONS WERE MOVING FROM PILOTS TO SCALE -- WE HAVE KENDALL -- DAR FLEUR -- PROJECT DIRECTOR AT THE UCLA INTEGRATED SUB HAVEN'T SPOKE SYSTEM AND IT'S THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN VALUATION REPORT AND DOCTOR DERREN ARATTA A RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST AT UCLA INTEGRATES SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS IS GONNA OF REVIEW THE STATE'S DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZES THE RE SYSTEM WAIVER AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN EVALUATION AS WELL. WELCOME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HI HI -- I'M GOVERNOR OUT OF AS A DARK PANTS AT ALL I AM -- THAT'S A PLEASURE AND AN HONOR TO TO ADDRESS PANEL -- TO ADDRESSES BETTY -- THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR INVITATION. DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS ALL I'LL KEEP MY OF COMMENTS BRIEF. ODDS BY NORMAL OF DISCLAIMER ON BALD ANYTHING I SAID IT IS MY OPINION AND NOBODY ELSE IS TO BLAME -- I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZE WILL RE SYSTEM -- DEMONSTRATION JUSTICE IF YOU SLICE. FOR ANYBODY WHO -- MIGHT NOT BE PUT -- COMPLETELY -- FAMILIAR THE ONE SENTENCE THAT IT PROVIDES ACCESS TO TREATMENT SERVICES NOT PREVIOUSLY COVERED BY DRUG MEDI CAL AS PART OF AN ORGANIZED FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE DOESN'T DO FULL JUSTICE TO IT BUT IT'S WHERE I CITIES SEATED -- WORKING INTO THIS. THIS HEARING ON APPEAL ITS FIFTH SPECIFICALLY. IT DOES INCLUDE OPIOID TREATMENT IT DOES IT'S NOT LIMITED TO THAT -- A PARTICIPATING COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE -- AT ACCESS TO TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO A TO A TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ARE ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ALL FDA APPROVED MEDICATIONS FOR SUBSTANCES DISORDERS -- SAID BUT DIEM SERIOUS GOES A GOES BEYOND OPIOIDS OF COURSE AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO PLACE IT AND INTO CONTEXT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE METHAMPHETAMINES. EVEN WHEN I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY THEY THEY ARE IN A INCREASING -- USE OF THAT IS INCREASING AND WE KNOW THAT. IT IF WE JUST TEND TO ATTACK ONE DRUG IT TENDS TO MANIFEST AGAIN IN IN IN IN OTHER PLACES WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH OPIOIDS WHEN WE ADDRESS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE OF THE THE OVERDOSE DEATHS FOR ABSURD PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAVE LEVELED OFF BUT THEN WE SEE INCREASES IN HEROIN. AND AND FEDERAL DEATH SO -- DMCA ODS -- I SEE AS SORT OF A BACKSTOP ADDRESSING ALL DRUGS -- SO WHERE ARE WE IN IMPLEMENTATION FORTY COUNTIES OF IT -- SUBMITTED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS WOULD COVER ABOUT 97% OF OF THE STATE'S POPULATION BUT IT'S BEEN A HEAVY LEFT AND SO IT'S BEEN A A PROCESS TO GET ALL THE COUNTIES -- GOING THERE ARE STILL GOING LIFE AS AS WE AS WE SPEAK IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO JUST VERY BRIEFLY -- THE THE RESULTS THATWE'RE SEEING SO FAR IS THAT WE ARE SEEING INCREASING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING INTO TREATMENT -- ABOUT 7%. IN THE INITIAL SEVEN COUNTIES BUT THE MIX OF TREATMENT IS CHANGING SO MORE RESIDENTIAL -- THE THAN THAN THE PREVIOUSLY OF THESE CHANGES AND PLACEMENT APPEAR TO BE APPROPRIATE BASED ON ASSESSMENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN -- IN 93% OF THE PATIENTS WERE COME COMING INTO TREATMENT AND RATE THEIR TREATMENT POSITIVELY WHICH IS AT THE I THINK IS REMARKABLE -- AND COUNTY ADMINISTRATORS OVERWHELMING OVERWHELMINGLY REPORT THAT THE WAIVER HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ON THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. SO IN SUMMARY JUSTICE -- WHO WAS SO FAR FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN A VERY -- PROMISING INITIAL SIGNS THERE ARE THERE ARE CHALLENGES -- A IT'S IT'S NOT PERFECT IT'S A HEAVY LIFT AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE STILL GETTING COUNTIES ON BOARD -- BECAUSE OF THAT AND WITH THE WAIVER ENDING IN TWENTY TWENTY I THINK IT IT MAKES SENSE -- TO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT BUT I THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO EXTEND ANOTHER CENTRIST. SINCE WE'RE JUST GETTING THE SYSTEM AND AND A PLACE AS IT WAS INTENDED -- WITH THAT I THINK IT THE THEY'RE ALL ALSO CHALLENGES PENETRATION RATES GETTING ENOUGH TREATMENT OUT THERE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT PEOPLE DON'T. OF GET INTO TREATMENT AS THEY THEY DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF TREATMENT I'VE I'VE I'VE MODIFIED THE SLIDES I'M SORRY I I KEPT A FIDDLING WITH IT -- SO ONE OF THE WAYS I THINK WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT IS TO ENGAGE WITH THE REST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND KINDLED ARE FULLER IT WILL TALK ABOUT THE UP IN SMOKE SYSTEM WHICH TALKS WHICH IS. RELEVANT TO THAT -- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AGAIN -- FOR HAVING US AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT TOWARDS THESE EFFORTS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR OPIATE USE DISORDERS -- AGAIN I'M CANDLES ARE FULLER AND THE PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR UCLA'S EVALUATION OF THE CALIFORNIA HUB AND SPOKE PROGRAM. THE HAVEN'T SPOKE PROGRAM IS BASED ON AN INNOVATIVE MODEL OUT OF VERMONT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDERS WHICH INCLUDE METHADONE. BUPRENORPHINE AND THAT THE TRIAL -- BUT THE FOCUS OF THIS APPROACH IS REALLY ON BUPRENORPHINE -- BECAUSE IS DARREN WAS MENTIONING -- THE MODEL IS DESIGNED TO REACH THINGS WHO MAY NOT HAVE A LOCAL METHADONE OPIATE TREATMENT PROGRAM NEARBY -- LIKE THOSE IN RURAL AREAS OR OTHER UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES -- EVEN WORKING CAN BE PRESCRIBED IN OFFICE SPACE TREATMENT SETTINGS LIKE PRIMARY CARE OFFICES. BY PRACTITIONERS HAVE GOTTEN A SAM'S A WAIVER TO PRESCRIBE IT -- SO IN THE MODEL SPECIALTY OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS OR HUBS CONNECT WITH -- OFFICE SPACE SETTINGS FOLKS TO OFFER GUIDANCE IN TREATING OPIOID USE DISORDERS AND TO SERVE AS REFERRAL SITES FOR PATIENTS WHO NEED A MORE INTENSIVE LEVEL OF CARE -- THIS ALL REQUIRES BUILDING NEW AFFILIATIONS AND CARE COR NATION'S BETWEEN OTP AN OFFICE SPACE SETTINGS -- AND CALIFORNIA HAS REALLY BEEN LEADING THE WAY IN IMPLEMENTING THIS HUB AND SPOKE MODEL -- SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THE NETWORK LOOKS LIKE AND HOW IS IT HOW IT'S GROWN OVER TIME -- WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF MAPS THE FIRST SHOWS THE NETWORK WHEN THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION STARTED IN HUBS AND SPOKES AND AUGUST. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT THE TIME THERE WERE FIFTY SEVEN FOLKS AMONG THE EIGHTEEN HAVEN'T SPOKE NETWORKS. AND BY JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED SPOKE TREATMENT LOCATIONS -- A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE LOCATED UP IN THOSE RURAL NORTHERN COUNTIES -- WHICH HAVE EXPERIENCED AGAIN THOSE HIGHEST OVERDOSE DEATH RATES -- SO IN THE NEXT FEW SLIDES WE HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY DATA ON THE NUMBERS OF PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS IN THE HUB AND SPOKE NETWORK. SO HERE YOU'LL SEE DATA THAT UCLA -- COLLECTED FROM ALL HUBS AND SPOKES ON THE NUMBERS OF NEW PATIENTS STARTING ALL THREE MEDICATIONS EACH MONTH DATING BACK TO SEVEN MONTHS PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. SO OVER THAT BASELINE PERIOD BEFORE THE DOTTED LINE THERE -- WE'VE SEEN GROWTH BOTH IN THE OVER OF PATIENTS STARTING TREATMENT -- BUT ALSO WHAT'S REALLY GREAT HERE -- IS THERE'S BEEN A BIG UPTURN IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS RECEIVING BUPRENORPHINE WHICH IS THAT DARK BLUE LINE THERE -- JUMPING UP EVEN HIGHER THAN METHADONE -- SO THAT DATA REALLY SPEAKS TO THE GROWTH IN THOSE SPOKE OFFICE BASED TREATMENT SETTINGS -- WHICH IS DUE IN PART TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS -- WEAVER TO PRESCRIBE ME PRINT ARE FEEDING. SO THIS IS SLIGHTLY OLDER DATA DATA FROM OCTOBER -- BUT AGAIN WE'VE SEEN GROWTH IN THE OVERALL NUMBERS OF PROVIDERS -- BUT WHAT YOU'LL ALSO SEE IS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A GAP -- AMONG THE SPOKE PROVIDERS WHO GET WAVERED AND THEN THOSE WHO ACTUALLY START PRESCRIBING SO THE NUMBER WHO GET LEVERAGES ALONG THE TOP PLAN THERE AND THE PERCENTAGES THOSE WHO ARE ACTIVELY PRESCRIBING DEEPER MORPHINE -- SO WHEN WE SURVEYED HAVEN'T SPOKE PROVIDERS ABOUT THEIR PRESCRIBING PRACTICES. THOSE WHO WERE WAVERED BUT HAD NEVER PRESCRIBE PEOPLE ARE BEING WERE LESS LIKELY THAN THOSE ACTIVE PRESCRIBERS TO FEEL THAT THEY HAD THE MENTORSHIP THEY NEEDED TO PRESCRIBE. OTHER BARRIERS THAT CAME UP IN THE SURVEYS AND IN OTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH PROVIDERS HAVE INCLUDED PROVIDER KNOWLEDGE IN ATTITUDES ABOUT MEDICATIONS. STIGMA TOWARDS OPIOID USE DISORDERS. ACCESS ACCESS TO COUNSELING SERVICES AND PHARMACIES FOR PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS AND FEARS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF PRESCRIBING -- TO ADDRESS THE GAP IN PRESCRIBING UCLA HAS WORKED WITH A GROUP AT STANFORD TO DEVELOP THE HUB AND SPOKE PROVIDER FACILITATOR PROGRAM WHICH AIMS TO CONNECT -- CHAMPION PHYSICIAN PRACTITIONERS WITH THOSE SPOKE PROVIDERS TO HELP THEM WITH ANY CHALLENGES THEY MAY BE HAVING IN IMPLEMENTING MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT -- AND SO FAR THERE ARE TWENTY FACILITATOR CHAMPIONS WORKING ACROSS THE EIGHTEEN HAVEN'T SPOKE NETWORKS -- SO AGAIN WE DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE SEEN REALLY REALLY PROMISING GROWTH IN THE VERY SHORT TIME THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN RUNNING -- THE BARRIERS DO REMAIN -- AND CONTINUING TO EXPAND ACCESS REDUCE DISORDERS WILL REQUIREBY AND FROM STAKEHOLDERS AT MANY LEVELS -- AND WE REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THIS WORK SO FAR. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I WANT -- TO WELCOME AT CENTER RUBIO AND SOME MEMBER RAMOS THANKS VERY MUCH -- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A WHITE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OKAY YEAH THE THE SUMNERS LEISURE WHAT THANK YOU. POPULATION IS NOW GOD COVERED ANDERS THE M. C. O. D. S. OUT WELL OR OR OR IS. 97% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE. WELL ELAINE THAT YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU -- SO. OF THE FORTY COUNTIES OUT OF THE SUBMITTED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS NOT ALL OF THEM GONE LIFE I THINK FOR AROUND TWENTY TWO OF OF HAVE SAID ACTUALLY STARTED WITH SERVICES -- SO THAT LEAVES ANOTHER EIGHTEEN OR SO THAT. HAVE NOT STARTED YET BUT IF IF IF THEY DO SUCCESSFULLY ALL BEGAN THEN. THAT WOULD ADD UP 297% OF OF THE POPULATION LIVING IN THOSE COUNTIES IT'S THERE'S OF THERE'S A FEW THAT ARE -- WELL. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SPEAK TO THIS BETTER THAN THAN I CAN I I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY IF ALL FORTY OUT OF FORTY WILL WILL GO LIVE IN A OKAY. AND SO THERE SO HE SAID THEY'RE CURRENTLY EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN COUNTIES -- BUT THE MOST IT MY IMPRESSION IS THAT MOSTLY THE ONES THAT HAVE ADOPTED IN A RURAL COUNTIES RIGHT WELL THAT YEAH YEAH THE SMALL COUNTIES. YEAH SO. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT YEAH THAT'S? FOR FOR VERY SMALL COUNTIES HONESTLY I I'M NOT SURE. WELL ONE OF THE EFFORT THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS TO DO REGIONAL MODEL SO -- SEVERAL SMALL COUNTIES ARE WORKING WITH PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN -- TO HE TRIED TRY TO WORK OUT SOMETHING WHERE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO ALL HAVE TO HAVE THE FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE BUT THEY CAN REFER TO ANOTHER PEOPLE TO ANOTHER COUNTY. SO THAT'S PROMISING -- IT THE THERE'VE BEEN DIFFICULTIES AS A IT HASN'T STARTED YET BUT I'M NOT. I'M NOT DEEPLY INVOLVED EXACTLY KNOWING WHY I KNOW IT'S A COMPLICATED THING TO SET UP THE HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET THAT RUNNING AND THAT COULD SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE SMALL COUNTIES. THERE MAY HONESTLY BE SOME -- THE IF YOU'RE ALPINE COUNTY OF POPULATION OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND YOU HAVE A MINIMUM BASE ALLOCATION OF THE MONEY THAT'S COMING TO FOR TREATMENT THROUGH OTHERS DAVIS OF THE OTHER OTHER FUNDING SOURCES. AND YOU'VE GOT ONE OR TWO PEOPLE MAYBE THAT'LL PRESENT FOR TREATMENTEACH MONTH I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT'S WORDS WITH -- YOU KNOW EVER BEING ABLE TO REACH ALL THE GMC ODS -- REQUIREMENTS. OF WHETHER THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE IN TERMS OF JUST THE TIME AND EFFORT I I DO THINK YOU KNOW THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM IT BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S GONNA BE I MEAN THEY WOULD GET INCREASED RATES IN. THE BILL THE BILL FOR THINGS -- THAT THEY OTHERWISE COULDN'T BE BUT IF IF THEY JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THEY THEY NEED IT BECAUSE OF THE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE. IT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A A A A A POINT WHERE. THOSE KINDS COUNTIES MIGHT NOT PARTICIPATE I DON'T KNOW. SO IT ARE YOU FIND ARE WE NOT DONE WANTED OVER GENERALIZED REFINING AND SOME OF THE SOME OF THOSE SMALLER COUNTIES AT THEIR THERE IS A DENIAL OF MAYBE THERE'S A PROBLEM OR OR THERE'S A RELUCTANCE BECAUSE FOR FOR WHATEVER REASON TO ENGAGE IN THIS -- I REPRESENT THREE COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY REALLY HARD YET. AND I SEE UP THERE THAT YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM HAS A I SPOKE I SAW ON THE ON THE BORDER BETWEEN TRINITY AND MENACING OR TRAINING HUMBLE -- BUT WE YOU KNOW. I CAN YEP RIGHT THERE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE IN THAT MENDOCINO HUMBLE REST ACTUALLY HUMBLE TRINITY AREA. AND WE HAVE SOME I HAVE A HUGE CHALLENGES AND AND AND HUMBOLDT COUNTY AS WELL SO. SO -- IS IT IS IT IS IT THE PAPER WORK IS IT IS IT. IS IT THE IS IT THE THE ACCEPTANCE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM. I'M I'M TRYING TO GET TO THE ROOT YEAH AND AND SO WHEN YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO GET 27097%. WHAT'S THE 3% THE WON'T BE COVERED IS THAT GONNA BE IS THAT GONNA BE RURAL COUNTIES BECAUSE PROBABLY WHERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM. SO HOW DO WE AS A WHEN I THINK OF THAT WHEN I HEAR 97% PERCENT I THINK OF HIS BROADBAND. OKAY THE RACES BROADBAND WE HAVE THAT 3% DOES HAVE COVERAGES. IN MY COUNTIES. ON EXCEPT 7% WHERE IS THE 3% IS IT IS IT ALL IN RURAL COUNTIES AND IF IT IS HOW DO WE GET THE PENETRATION TO MAKE TO MAKE THIS WORK. RIGHT -- WELL IT IT'S IT'S IT PROBABLY IS THE RURAL COUNTIES AND TO SOME EXTENT IT MIGHT BE. ON ON TO SPECULATE BEYOND THE DATA THAT PERHAPS BUT TO SET UP A A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM OR AND NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAM YOU NEED CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN THERE TO MAKE IT. ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. OF THE SET UP COUNTY PROGRAM -- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT IT THEN IT BECOMES A MATTER OF RESOURCES -- THINGS LIKE HUB AND SPOKE I THINK. MIGHT BE PROMISING AND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SET UP A SPECIALTY CARE PROGRAM -- BILLS COUNTIES. HAVE. YOU KNOW MAXIS PRIMARY CARE IF YOU HAVE A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND CAN CAN -- INTEGRATE BEEPING OFF -- INTO THAT THAT MIGHT BE. I I ACTUALLY THINK -- THAT'S A GOOD SOLUTION EVERYWHERE BUT ESPECIALLY AND AND OF WORLD -- COUNTIES. 90% 995% OF PEOPLE WHO -- DON'T GET TREATMENT THEY DON'T GET IT A PROBLEM SO BUT 85% OF AMERICANS HAVE SOME INTERACTION WITH THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EVERY YEAR SO. THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING LET'S LET'S LET'S ENGAGE IN THERE I THINK AND I THINK THEIR WAYS TO DO THAT. SO I YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HELP PARTNERSHIP IS A BIG -- A BIG PART OF MY DISTRICT -- AND AND SO THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIP TO ENGAGE MORE AYE AYE WELCOME I WELCOME THAT. SO I DO WONDER SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE PROVIDERS NOW THAT HAVE -- HAVE THE TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE ANY OF 69% UPTAKE. SO THE 31%. WHERE ARE THEY ARE THOSE ARE THOSE ALSO RURAL -- DO THEY NOT FEEL THEY HAVE A SUPPORTER OF THE OR THE OR THE OR THE BACKGROUND. ARE THOSE ARE THOSE -- FOLKS THAT -- MAYBE OUR PROVIDERS IN IN OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE THREE TIMES THE THE OVERDOSE RATE -- SO SO WHERE IS THAT 31% THAT'S NOT UTILIZING THE TRAINING THEY HAVE TO HELP WITH THE SITUATION. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- I DON'T HAVE THAT DATA WITH ME NOW -- MY SENSE IT'S IT'S IT'S PRETTY WIDESPREAD BUT YOU COULD BE CORRECT THAT IT IS IN THOSE -- COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARDEST WE DO HAVE THE PRACTICE FACILITATORS WORKING IN ALL OF THE REGIONS OF THE HUB AND SPOKE NETWORK -- BUT AGAIN YOU COULD BE CORRECT. WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE THE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT THAT THAT BACK TO US BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO KNOW BECAUSE SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARD TO SEE. AND WHILE THE NUMBERS MAY NOT BE A BIG NUMBER COMPARED TO SOME LARGER COMMUNITIES PROPORTIONALLY RATHER HIGH. ESPECIALLY IN OUR MORE ISOLATED COMMUNITIES IN OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND AND SO SO. I WANT TO BE THIS UP BUT I GO BACK TO I THINK SOME F OUR HARDEST HIT AREAS WERE THE ONES THAT ARE. THAT ARE NOT SEEN THE PENETRATION OF WOULD LIKE TO SEE. AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I'M PUSHING FOR THANK YOU. CENTER RUBIO THANK YOU -- MY QUESTION GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE MY QUESTION AND YOU KNOW MISTER WOULD SORT OF GOT AHEAD OF WHAT I WAS THINKING. WHEN I WAS READING THE RESEARCH THAT WAS PROVIDED IT DOES TALK ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS BEING TWICE? I EXPENSIVE TWICE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS AS COMPARED TO WHITES AND I KNOW THAT WE NEED NO PEOPLE OF COLOR USUALLY TEND TO HAVE HIGHER NUMBERS BUT THAT TO ME WAS PARTICULARLY -- WELL AS WHAT I FOCUSED ON IN TERMS OF AND SAYS HOW CAN WE IMPROVE IT BUT I GUESS YOU KIND AROUND YOU ASKED THE SAME QUESTION. HIS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY STRIKES ME AS HOW DO WE GET SERVICES TO THESE FOLKS AND EVEN AS COMPARED TO LATINOS AND OTHERS. NATIVE AMERICANS TEND TO HAVE THE HIGHEST DEATH SO I JUST KIND OF ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK INTO THAT AND SEE IF YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION AS HOW WE CAN MAKE A BETTER. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT NOW -- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE% UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UCLA AND USC DO SOMETIMES WORK TOGETHER -- THEY THEY ARE CONDUCTING A TRAVEL NEEDS ASSESSMENT ON ON THE ENTIRE. SYSTEM AND THERE. THEIR REPORT SHOULD BE DO SO -- THERE'S IT SHOULD BE COMPLETE SOMETIME AROUND THE SUMMER -- BUT THEY'VE BEEN. THE SAME WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WE'VE BEEN SAYING SAYS THE SAME THINGS PARTICULARLY BUT FUNCTIONAL DEATHS AND AND THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW. WHEN THEY GO OUT -- THE PERSON WORKING WITH SHE'S BEEN DOING THIS KIND OF RESEARCH. FOR FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND SAYS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WHERE PEOPLE FROM THESE COMMUNITIES ARE ACTUALLY CONTACTING HER AND SAYING CAN YOU DO A FOCUS GROUP IN OUR IN IN IN. IN OUR AREA BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVESOME SOME MORE RECOMMENDATIONS LATER THIS SUMMER. THANK YOU FOR THAT SO WHEN YOU DO THAT -- THE THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT MAKE SURE TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH US I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] SUMMARY MUST [inaudible] THANK YOU. I LIKE A POPULATION. THIS REPORT AND AT 17% -- PER ONE THOUSAND A HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS IS FAR MORE HIGHER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER -- SUB CATEGORIES THAT ARE THERE. NOW THE DIFFERENCE IN IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE'RE TALKING URBAN -- NATIVE AMERICANS AND THOSE THAT ARE LIVING ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS THE OUTRAGE IN FOCUS GROUPS IS GOING THERE YOU MENTIONED THAT -- THERE'S BEEN SOME OUT REACH AS FAR AS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS EPIDEMIC THAT'S FACING CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY WE SEE -- THE THE HIGHEST RATE. SO WE START TO TALK ABOUT -- AREAS LATER ON IN THE AGENDA AS FAR AS HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME INTERVENTION SOME IDEAS OF THOSE THINGS. HOW ARE WE REACHING OUT TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION KNOWING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION? AND DEALING AGAIN WITH URBAN URBAN -- INDIANS THAT LIVE IN THE CITIES AND THOSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON FEDERAL INDIAN RESERVATIONS I THINK WE WE OWE T TO BRING THE STATISTICS. Là MUCH LOWER -- EVEN IF WE BROUGHT IT TO WHERE OTHERS ARE AT BUT YET THERE HAS TO BE A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS TO IT EVEN IN THE DIFFERENT REPORTS THAT ARE. COMING FORWARD SO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT KNOWING THAT THERE'S SOME CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE THERE IS -- WAYS THAT WE CAN GET INVOLVED -- TO BE ABLE TO OPEN UP SOME OF THOSE DIALOGUES WITH SOME OF THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE RESOURCES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE ALSO. SO HOW DO WE GET TO THAT POINT SO THAT WHEN WE GET ANOTHER REPORT. THAT WE SEE THE STATISTICS ARE ISJUST WITH THE THE PRESENTATION HERE TODAY BUT MY COLLEAGUES KNOW THAT OTHER AREAS TO NATIVE AMERICAN -- STATISTICS ARE HIGHER THREE TIMES HIGHER FIVE TIMES HIGHER IN OTHER CATEGORIES THAT ARE THERE TOO SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GOT THE ATTENTION OF MYSELF IN THE COLLEAGUES THAT ARE BRING IT UP ALSO. SO HOW DO WE START TO DEAL WITH THAT AND HOW DO WE START -- TO BUILT ON THAT COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION THAT'S OUT THERE. QUESTION SO -- IN TERMS OF THE WORLD WE HAVE THE WEEK I GUESS IT STARTS WITH A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THAT'S GOING ON THROUGH UFC UNDER NOT DOCTOR CLEARED IN A SUBTLE WHICH IS WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF GROUPS LIKE -- CRIB IN -- SICKLY OTHER THE TICKET GATE -- URBAN AND RURAL AND PUT. THEIR ALSO PROJECTS ARE BEING STARTED -- THROUGH RECENT SO ARE FINISHED A BUT FAILED. RESPONSE -- GRANTS. FOR BETTER TARGETED SPECIFICALLY AT AT THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY -- DHS CAN PROBABLY TALK A BETTER -- MORE IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THOSE THERE'S THERE'S TELEHEALTH THERE'S A LEAVING OUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS WITH IT THAT THEY DO HAVE SOME THINGS GOING ON AND HOPEFULLY AFTER WE GET THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT. WILL HAVE BETTER DIRECTION ON WHERE TO GO NEXT [inaudible] THANK YOU. REALLY IS MAKING SURE THAT RESOURCES ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE GET TO THOSE THAT THE THOSE RESOURCES IN THE SO THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK. SO I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AS WELL AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND I WOULD MAKE NO WE WERE -- ALSO HAVE A PANEL ON THE PLANS FOR EXPANDING THE PILOTS INSISTING SERVICES SO I HOPE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE ON THAT PANEL OR SOME OTHER QUESTIONS -- BECAUSE WE ARE HOPING TO GET SOME ANSWERS FROM YOU AS WELL ABOUT THIS -- THIS. YOU GUYS ARE THE EVALUATORS SO I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT -- SO THE THE ORGANIZER EVERY SYSTEM WAIVER WAS ABOUT. FOUR YEARS OLD NOW THREE FOUR YEARS OLD IT WAS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FIFTEEN YEAH AND BY TAKES A LITTLE TIME OKAY -- SO AFTER THAT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION -- YOU KNOW THE RESULTS FROM THE SEVEN COUNTIES IF THIS THAT. THE STATE IN MY MIND A LITTLE SPARSE ARE YOU GETTING THE KIND OF DATA YOU NEED TO DO A MORE DETAILED EVALUATION THAN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET HERE OR IS IT JUST THAT TIMING WISE YOU JUST DON'T HAVE. THAT I MEAN ARE YOU HAVING THE DATA DO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO MUCH MORE DETAILED EVALUATION THEY'RE ABLE TO PRESENT YOUR DAY. OF THE YES WERE WERE --% THERE'S ALWAYS DELAYS AND ENDED REPORTING -- WE WE ARE GETTING A NEW BATCH OF OF DATA RIGHT RIGHT NOW THAT WILL BE USING FOR REPORT THEY'LL COME OUT IN. A FEW MONTHS IN JULY AND THAT WILL INCLUDE MUCH MORE THAN THE SEVEN COUNTIES. SO THAT YEAH. THE THE UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY DID I HAD FOR YOU TODAY WAS FROM THE REPORT WHICH EARNED IN LAST YEAR WHICH WAS BASED ON THE SEVEN COUNTIES AND THAT WAS BASED ON DATA THAT WE GOT IN AROUND MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO. IT'S IT'S IT'S BAD TIME BUT HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE MORE SOON AND I RECOGNIZE THIS. HAVING DONE RESEARCH MYSELF EVALUATION THAT THERE'S OF THAT BUT I JUST WONDERED AT THE DATA WILL BE COMING FOR YOU TO DO MUCH MORE DETAILED EVALUATION. AND AND ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE THE KIND OF DATA AND ACTUALLY PRICE FOR BOTH OF YOU TO DO THAT BREAK OUTS THAT. THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ASKING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DO ZERO IN ON EXACTLY ALSO. ON LIKE OKAY WELL WHERE ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ARE ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS WERE AWARE -- POPULATIONS THAT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BECAUSE I THINK I SHARED CONCERN OF THOUGHT -- OF DOCTOR WOULD THAT -- YOU KNOW IS A 97% SOUNDS REALLY GOOD BUT THE 3% IF WE DON'T IF WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF DATA THAT LET US DRILL IN DRILL DOWN ON THE 3% ON THE NATIVE AMERICAN -- YOU KNOW PART OF THE APPLICATION ON OTHER FIVE AFFECTED POPULATIONS THEN WHY AM IS AND WE SORT OF GO ALL LOOK OVERALL IT'S PRETTY GOOD BUT ACTUALLY WERE FEELING AND AND PARTICULAR AT ME AND WE CAN DO WE HAVE ARE YOU COLLECTING THE KIND OF DATA THAT CAN DRILL. DOWN INTO THAT. YEAH I THINK WE'LL HAVE THAT -- WELL WHAT WAS REALLY OF THE TRIBAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND THEN WILL HAVE -- ANOTHER THE NEXT REPORT FOR HUB AND SPOKE IS. SCHEDULED FOR WELL WE'RE TURNING SAN IN SOMETHING IN APRIL BUT THEN SEPTEMBER THAT BUT I GUESS IT'S AN IDEA I APPRECIATE YOU HAVE A REPORT COMING UP I AM SAYING IS THAT IS A TRULY ARE YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES TO COLLECT THE KIND OF DATA THAT WHEN WE ASK. YOU THE QUESTIONS WHEN THAT REPORT COMES OUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS NOT TURN AROUND TO US AND SAY WELL WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF DATA SO WE CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THAT'S WHY ONE DOES ARE YOU GETTING THE ARE YOU PARTICIPATING GETTING THE DATA YOU NEED ANSWERED KIND OF QUESTIONS WE GOT WERE ASKING. YES OKAY THE WIND HAS BEEN THANK YOU FOR ASKING -- AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING IS YOU SAID YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I APPRECIATE THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE RECEIVING TREATMENT ROSE 7%. BUT I LIKE TO KNOW LIKE WHAT IS THE DENOMINATOR SO -- SO AND I REALIZED MAYBE A LITTLE BIT SAVE ONLY SERVING 1% OF PEOPLE AND WE INCREASED BY 7% I'D GO. THAT'S STILL FAILURE RIGHT ARE WE SERVING 20% WE HAVE A SEVEN FRIEND SENT ENTRIES BECAUSE THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. SO DO WE KNOW WHAT THE DENOMINATOR IS ANOTHER WORDS OKAY GREAT RECESSION RIGHT YEAH SO WHAT PROPORTION OF THEM OF THE I GUESS THE MAN ARE WE ACTUALLY SERVING EVEN WITH THE GETTING CLOSE TO A 100% ARE WE STILL LIKE BELOW 50%. WERE FORMULA FAR BELOW OKAY SO INCREASE OF CERTAINLY BETTER DECREASE BUT NO WHERE NEAR THE KIND OF PROGRESS WE NEED TO MAKE. NOW IT'S WAR PROBABLY AROUND FOR A LITTLE OVER 4% -- THAT'S THE PERCENT OF A PERCENTAGE OF THE NEED THAT'S OUT THERE NOW AS I SAID 95% OR SO OF OF THE PEOPLE WHO. WE THINK NEED TREATMENT DON'T THINK THEY NAY TREATMENTS ALL I UNDERSTAND IT'LL LEAVE. SO FORGET FOR A 44% OF THE REMAINING 5% I GUESS THAT'S IN INCENSE GOOD BUT THAT'S WHY WE WE NEED WE DO NEED TO GET DRILL INTO THAT 95% GET THEM. INTO TREATMENT YEAH SITES I JUST WEIGHING KNOWLEDGE I MEAN. I'M NOT SAYING PEOPLE ARE WORKING REALLY HARD BUT WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM SOLVING THE PROBLEM. YES AND THEN I APPRECIATE YOU SAID 93% OF THE PATIENTS RESEARCH EVEN POSITIVELY BUT GIVEN THE FACT YEAH USUALLY THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T RATE A POSITIVE AREN'T THE ONES ARE STICKING AROUND FOR THE SURVEY RIGHT SO I MEAN IT'S OF THOSE YEAH NO THAT WHAT SO WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE THEM -- AS GREAT POINT I COULD I COULD TELL YOU ARE RESEARCH I I LIKE THAT -- WOULD SERVE THE THESE ARE NOT A SURVEYS ARE GIVEN OUT DURING THAT CERTAIN WEEK IN IN -- SO IF IF THAT WAS OUR FIRST DAY THEY WOULD STILL GET IT. NOW THE PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T GET OF OUR YOU KNOW PEOPLE NEVER MADE INTO TREATMENT AND I GUESS IF THEY DROP OUT OF TREATMENT AND THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO MISS THAT WEEK I GUESS SO. THERE ARE LIMITATIONS FOR SURE SOAND I REALIZE YOU'RE TO EVALUATOR YOU'RE NOT FOR SOME WRITING PROGRAM I THINK SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ASK THEN IS HOW DO YOU REACH THE OTHER PEOPLE I REALIZE IT'S DIFFICULT BUT THE A WORD WORD. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO OKAY. AND IN TERMS OF THE HUB AND SPOKE PROGRAM CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. ARE THERE SOME IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF ACCESS FOR THE SPOKES SO -- I UNDERSTAND PARTICULARLY IN MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES. SO WE HAVE HUB AND WE HAVE SPOKE MAYBE WE CAN GET INTO THIS MORE WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE THE PROGRAM BUT TO WHAT DEGREE HE DOES A SPOKE DEPENDING WHERE IT IS. MAY NEED TO BE A LOT MORE HELP LIKE BECAUSE THE HUB IS SO FAR AWAY ARE HARD TO ACCESS SO CAN CAN YOU MAY BE SPEAK TO IN YOUR VALUATION -- WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IT IN TERMS OF -- WHETHER THE SPOKES ARE -- ABLE TO DO ENOUGH TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH THIS MODEL. YEAH SO THERE ARE CERTAINLY MANY SPOKES THAT HAVE TO SORT OF FUNCTION AS HUBS ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL NORTH -- THOSE -- SPOKES ARE LOCATED MUCH MUCH FURTHER FROM THEIR HUBS AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE IN THE HUMBOLDT AREA THERE ISN'T THE HELP LOCATION -- SO WE'VE SORT OF BEEN CALLING THOSE SUPER SPOKES -- AND THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY FUNCTIONING TO TAKE ON PATIENTS WITH -- MORE COMPLEX OPIATE USE DISORDERS AND THE ONLY THING THAT THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE IS METHADONE -- BUT WE CERTAINLY ARE SEEING A LOT OF THAT. THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU KNOW. WE ARE INTERESTED IN SIR DRAWING DOWN ON THOSE PROVIDERS WHO GOT TRAINING AND YET STILL ARE NOT COMFORTABLE AND WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO KNOCK DOWN THOSE BARRIERS BECAUSE CLEARLY WE'VE INVESTED IN THEM. BUT DATE FOR SOME REASON -- FEELING COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO DELIVER -- WILL -- AND SO. HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THAT RATE MUCH HIRED ARE YOU ABLE TO ASSESS THAT EVALUATION DATA THAT YOU'RE GETTING YEAH OKAY SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR NEXT REPORT AND HAVING THAT QUESTION HOPEFULLY -- GIVE US SOME INSIGHTS AND ANSWERS.

IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY IN FRONT OF YOU SENATORS AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN A DOCTOR WHAT FOR YOUR SUPPORT WITH OUR EUREKA CLINIC. I'M I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT ARE YOU JUST HAVE BEEN SPOKE SYSTEM. I OVERSEE THE JUST HAVEN'T SPOKE SYSTEM IN OUR ROLE NORTH PART OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF OUR UPDATES IN PROGRESS IN ALL SIX OF OUR GRANT REGIONS. AND THEN FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON OUR HOME. HERE THE AREAS I'D LIKE TO COVER TODAY. THROUGH THE HAVEN'T SPOKE GRANT T. JUST COVERS SIX REGIONS HUMBOLDT REDDING CHICO ROSEVILLE MARYSVILLE AND MANTECA. THE MAP ON THE LEFT OF YOU AS OUR PROJECTION OF ABOUT TWENTY SPOKESMAN WE INITIALLY STARTED IN JUNE OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE MAP ON THE RIGHT OF YOU IS OUR CURRENT HUB AND SPOKE SYSTEM WHICH HAS SIXTY ONE ACTIVE SPOKES. IN TWENTY COUNTIES SERVING NEARLY TWO THOUSAND SPOKE PATIENTS AND THREE HUNDRED HAVE PATIENCE. OVER 50% OF OUR SPOKES DID NOT HAVE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT PRIOR TO THIS GRANT. A LARGE PORTION OF OUR WORK WITH THEM IS IMPLEMENTING THESE SERVICES AND GETTING THEM ON THE GROUND RUNNING. ADDITIONALLY OUR GOAL WAS TO TARGET AS MANY OF THE TOP TEN OVER DOES COUNTIES AS WE COULD BUT OUR GRANT TERRITORY. AND WE WERE ABLE TO TACKLE SEVEN OF THOSE COUNTIES THOSE COUNTIES BEING HUMBOLDT DEL NORD SISKIYOU PLUMAS LAKE. MENDOCINO AND TWELVE ANY COUNTY IF. HERE IS AN OVERALL PATIENT GROWTH CHART OF OUR PATIENTS UP TODAY AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH. LAST MONTH TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE PATIENTS IN OUR HUB AND SPOKE SYSTEM FOR THE RURAL NORTH PART OF CALIFORNIA. HERE'S A SIDE BY SIDE PATIENT GROWTH CHART TO SHOW YOU WHAT THOSE PATIENTS ARE MADE UP. ON THE LEFT IS OUR HOW PATIENTS THREE HUNDRED ON THE RIGHT ARE SPOKE PATIENTS ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE PATIENTS. YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN TIMES MORE SPOKE PATIENTS THAN WE DO AT OUR HUBS BEING SERVED THROUGH THIS FEDERAL GRANT. AND THAT IS BECAUSE ONE OF OUR GOALS IS TO GET TREATMENT INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT OUR WORLD THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAD NO TREATMENT PRIOR OR HAD VERY LIMITED TREATMENT. AND SO ARE ANTI PEAS ARE HUBS PLAY. THESE NEXT FEW SLIDESHOW ARE SPOKE GROWTH TREND BY REGION AND HAVE SOME HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU I PASSED OUT THOSE HANDOUTS FOR YOU TO REFER -- FOR THE SECOND TIME I WILL BE GOING THROUGH THE FLIGHTS. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WE HAVE A STEADY GROWTH IN EACH REGION. HERE IS A LIST OF THE HUB AND SPOKE SERVICES THAT WE OFFER TO ALL OF OUR SPOKE AND COALITION PARTNERS AS APPLICABLE. I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT OUR OUR DRAWDOWNS ARE FOCUSED ON MATT PERSONNEL SALARIES MATT MEDICATION THE LOCKS OWN TRAININGS AND EDUCATION AN OPIOID COALITIONS. WE HAVE THIRTY SPOKE PARTNERS THAT MAKE UP THE SIXTY ONE ACTIVE SPOKE LOCATIONS IN THESE PARTNERS ARE LISTED HERE ON THE SLIDE. WE ALSO HAVE TWENTY COALITION PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND THEY ARE LISTED ON THE SLIDE AS WELL WE PARTICIPATE AND FUND THEM FINANCIALLY THROUGH THE FEDERAL GRANT. THESE ARE THIS IS A BREAKDOWN OF THE NALOXONE KIDS THAT WE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT OUR HUB AND SPOKE COMMUNITIES. TO DATE WE'VE DISTRIBUTED SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX KIDS TO THE AREAS OF NEED. THESE KIDS GO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. PUBLIC HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COALITIONS UNIVERSITIES AND COMMUNITY EVENTS. NOW LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HUMBOLDT. ON THE RIGHT WE HAVE OUR HUB AND SPOKE ABOUT FOR HUMBOLDT REGION. WE HAVE BUT STARS NEXT TO OUR SPOKE LOCATIONS AND OUR PHARMACY LOCATIONS THAT ARE HELPING US PROVIDE MEDICATION TO THE POPULATION AND TREATMENT. WE HAVE ELEVEN SPOKES TO DATE TO PHARMACIES IN THREE LOCATIONS THAT ARE WORKING WITH US AND THREE OPIOID COALITIONS. I'M A FEW HIGHLIGHTS THAT I WANT TO MENTION FAR HUMBLE TERRITORY AS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH WATER FRONT RECOVERY SERVICES WHICH IS ONE OF OUR SPOKE. TO PROVIDE A RESIDENTIAL MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT PILOT PROGRAM. THIS TREATMENT PROGRAM OFFERS MEDICATION TO PATIENTS THAT ARE THERE FOR RESIDENTIAL STAY PATIENCE THAT ARE THERE FOR THIRTY DAY DETOX OR NINETY DAY LONGER TERM RESIDENTIAL STAY. WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING A MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AFTER CARE PROGRAM WORKING WITH RECOVERY A LOT OF FRONT RECOVERY SERVICES. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING AND NOT PROGRAM IS PROVIDING A TRANSITION FOR OUR PATIENTS THAT ARE GOING FROM MATT RESIDENTIAL CARE TO MATT PRIMARY CARE. AT TIMES THERE IS A WAIT LIST AND SO SINCE ARE ABLE TO NOT HAVE A BREAK IN TREATMENTS WHILE THEY'RE ABLE TO TRANSITION TO MATT PRIMARY CARE. WITH EDIE BRIDGE COLLABORATION THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT HIGHLIGHT THAT WE HAVE WE COLLABORATED WITH SAINT JOE'S HOSPITAL AND THE CALIFORNIA ET BRIDGE TEAM. TO BRING BE FOR MORPHINE INTO THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO GET INDUCED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND THEN TRANSFER TO SPOKE PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY -- TO CONTINUE LONG TERM CARE. AND IN HUMBOLDT SPECIFICALLY WE DISTRIBUTED FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN KIDS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IN COALITIONS AND COMMUNITY EVENTS. AND AS OF FRIDAY OUR NUMBER OF REPORTS IS TWO HUNDRED AND TO REPORT IN THE WALK SOME REVERSALS FROM THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TRACKING. FIRM THERE MAY BE MORE. THESE ARE THE THREE COALITIONS THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING AND FUNDING THROUGH THE HUMBOLDT GRANTS ARE X. SAFE HUMBOLDT -- BUT COMMUNITY COALITION ARE X. SAFE DEL NORTE HUMBLE IS ONE AREA WHERE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE TRIBAL MAP PROGRAM WE HAVE FIVE TOTAL IN OUR REGION. WHAT ARE CHALLENGES AND HUMBLE? THERE THERE ARE FEW THAT I'VE LISTED HERE -- WHEN WE STARTED WORKING ON THE GROUNDS OPEN DOOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER WAS THE MAIN SOURCE FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT THROUGHOUT HUMBLE? THEY HAD APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED PATIENTS BEING PRESCRIBED SUBOXONE AND APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE PATIENTS WERE -- YOU DE RELATED. THERE BEN C. L. HERMAN'S BACHELOR HAD A VISION TO TREAT ALL MEDICAL CONDITIONS INCLUDING SUBSTANCE ABUSE BY INTEGRATING IT INTO PRIMARY CARE -- HOWEVER BEYOND OPEN DOOR HUMBLE EXPERIENCES LIMITED PRESCRIBER AND MATT PATIENT CAPACITY -- IN HUMBLE COUNTY 7% OF PRESCRIBERS HAVE A DATA TWO THOUSAND WEAVER HOWEVER MANY OF THOSE PRESCRIBERS ARE NOT UTILIZING THEIR WAIVER AND THOSE THAT ARE ARE NOT UTILIZING IT TO THEIR CAPACITY. FOR EVEN WHEN THE APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED PATIENTS BEING TREATED THEIR OPEN DOOR. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE URBAN INSTITUTE ESTIMATED THAT AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE WITH -- YOU DE IN THE COUNTY WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS LOCAL TREATMENT. WAIT LISTS ARE A BERRIER IN HUMBOLDT -- AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT OUR REGION AS WELL -- PATIENTS THAT WOULD LIKE FINALLY ABLE TO RECEIVE TREATMENT MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT WEEKS OR MONTHS TO GET INTO TREATMENT. MATT STAFF RECRUITING IT'S VERY LIMITED IN ALL OF OUR RURAL AREAS AN EXPRESSION IN HUMBOLDT WHERE WE HAVE THE FUNDING TO MAYBE PROVIDE THAT RECRUITMENT AND PAY THOSE SALARIES WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND THOSE PROVIDERS. OR THOSE NURSES OR THOSE CLINICIANS. TRANSPORTATION AND HUMBLE ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER TIME CAN BE VERY LIMITING TO BE ABLE TO GET TO AND FROM TREATMENT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE SOME OF OUR SPOKES FOR TELEMEDICINE. I BY EVEN IN OUR RURAL AREAS THAT CAN BE A BARRIER. AND THEN THE LACK OF PHYSICAL SPACE WITH BUSY A PRIVATE PRACTICES A BUSY HOSPITALS ONCE WE GET SOMEBODY ON BOARD TO pTREATMENT MODEL WE'RE TRYING TO BE CREATIVE WITH SPACE. AND IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND OUT WHERE TO HOUSE THOSE PROGRAMS ONE DAY THE PROGRAM CAN BE A MAP PROGRAM IN THE NEXT DAY IT MIGHT BE A GROUP. SO WHAT WE'RE BEING CREATIVE BUT THAT. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY LAST FLIGHT [inaudible] QUESTION. AND AT THE END OF THE PANEL THAT -- I'M SURE PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS IS YES. OKAY SO MISTER HARRIS OKAY. I THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE WITH RIVERSIDE COUNTY WITH THE OUR TEAM SIRIUS WAIVER. OUR FIRST OFF IT'S OF THE WAIVER HAS BEEN THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTIES IN MANY YEARS -- TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SYSTEM OF CARE -- THAT HAS THE FINANCIAL AND CLINICAL RESOURCES. I TO MORE FULLY ADDRESS THE COMPLEX WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. ARE THE WAIVER HAS ALLOWED RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO OFFER A MUCH WIDER CONTINUE WHAT OF SERVICES. THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE UNDER THE PREVIOUS STATE PLAN MODEL. I RIVERSIDE COUNTY WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO COUNTIES TO ROLL OUT THE WAIVER -- WE ROLLED IT OUT ON FEBRUARY FIRST OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE WAIVER ROLL OUT INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING ITEMS -- FIRST THE DMC WAIVER ALLOWED RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO ALMOST DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WE PROVIDED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT -- TO IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT MONTH WE PROVIDED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT TO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN INDIVIDUALS. AND IN AUGUST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT NUMBER HAD GROWN TO SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO PHIL OVER AN 80% INCREASE IN RESIDENTIAL -- CAPACITY THERE. I SECONDLY ARE THE WAIVER ALLOWED US TO REDUCE OUR WAIT TIMES FOR A WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT OR DETOX SERVICES AND RESIDENTIAL. UP BEFORE THE WAIVER TO WAIT TIMES FOR ANYWHERE FROM TWO MONTHS TO SIX MONTHS TO GET INTO TREATMENT. AND NOW WE'RE ABLE TO USUALLY PLACE PEOPLE WITH AND SOMETIMES STATE DAY THEY CALL OR WITHIN SEVEN DAYS -- THIRTEEN WE WERE ABLE TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT -- FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS AND OPIOID USE DISORDERS A LIKE YOU'VE HEARD OF FROM THE TESTIMONY FROM THE OTHERS. ON THE WAIVER ALSO WHEN WE WERE DESIGNING IT ALLOWED US TO ENGAGE OUR TREATMENT PROVIDERS. IN THE PLANNING DESIGN AND A ROLL OUT FOR A COMPLETE CONTINUUM OF CARE. ALSO WITH THE WAIVER WE WERE FINALLY ALLOWED TO PROVIDE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT FAMILY COUNSELING INDIVIDUAL THERAPY. ALL OF WHICH WERE NOT COVERED UNDER THE PREVIOUS STATE PLAN AND AMENDMENT. AND GAVE EQUAL AND REMEMBER TO EVERYONE. I FINALLY THE WAIVER ULTIMATELY PROVIDED AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING. FOR TREATMENT SERVICES IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY HELLO PRIOR TO THE WAIVER WE ARE ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND NOW WE'RE OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WE HAVE TO COVER SERVICES. ARE THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES IN THE ROLL OUT PROCESS. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONES WAS THE INABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH THE INCREASED LEVELS OF STAFFING NEEDED TO OUR PROVIDE SERVICES WITH ALL THE NEW SERVICES REQUIRED. NEW STAFFING AND AN RIVERSIDE HAD A HIRING FREEZE AND SO I MADE A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING BUT WE GOT THERE -- ALSO THERE IS EXTENSIVE TRAINING THAT WAS REQUIRED TO MEET THE OPERATING UNDER THE A SAM I REQUIREMENTS AND IN THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. A REALLY BIG CHALLENGE WAS THE SET UP OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR. HELPLINE WE HAD NO. INKLING OF HOW BUSY IT WAS GONNA BE -- AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED CALLS A MONTH IN -- JANUARY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO OVER FOUR THOUSAND CALLS IN FEBRUARY SO IT KINDA HIT IS. REALLY HARD. I'M. PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ISSUES -- TO DATE IS THAT IN THE CURRENT REGULATIONS CLIENTS ARE PERMITTED ONLY TO RESIDENTIAL I TREATMENT EPISODES OF UP TO NINETY DAYS NO ONE CALENDAR YEAR PERIOD. I'M IF AN INDIVIDUAL COMES IN AND USES FIVE DAYS AND THEN LEAVES AND THEN COMES BACK IN AND USES FIVE DAYS AND THEN LEAVE STATE. USED UP THERE AND TARA QUOTA FOR THE YEAR. UNDER THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGE IS THAT -- DEREGULATION CHANGE SO THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD GET A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS TOTAL -- FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR. REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF EPISODES THAT IT TAKES -- IN SUMMARY I WANT TO SAY THAT THE FAMILY TESTIMONY OF THE LIFE CHANGING SERVICES IS REALLY ON ENDING. I NEVER GET TIRED OF HEARING A CLIENT'S LOVED ONES COME AND TELL US THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME MY SON BACK THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME MY DAUGHTER BACK -- THE WAIVER IS CAUSING POSITIVE RIPPLE EFFECTS ACROSS THE SYSTEM OF CARE. AND INTEGRATING PHYSICAL. MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE HEALTH CARE AT A RATE THAT IS BREATHTAKING THANK YOU. VERY MUCH MISTER SANADA. THANK YOU YES SIR I ALSO KNOW WHAT PRESIDENT AND CEO OF TARZANA TREATMENT CENTERS A LARGE PROVIDER OF SERVICES REPRESENTING. ALL OF THE SERVICES UNDER THE ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM. BUT I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES AND WITH THAT REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS ALL WORKING IN THE FIELD. SO I APOLOGIZE THAT MIGHT WRITTEN COMMENTS HAD MADE IT TO YOU -- BY THIS MORNING BUT THEY WILL GET TO YOU SHORTLY -- I'M GONNA A JUST WALK THROUGH VERY QUICKLY -- SOME BULLET POINTS THAT ARE IN THOSE COMMENTS -- THEN WE'LL GO FROM THERE SO AND THESE ARE NOT IN ANY PARTICULAR PRIORITY ORDER WAS. SHOW UP PAYMENT REFORM -- WE ARE HOPING TO BEGIN A SERIOUS CONVERSATION AROUND PAYMENT REFORM -- IF IT DOESN'T START NOW THE OF PLANNING FOR A WAIVER RENEWAL. THE CURRENT COST BASED THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. I DON'T THINK TAKES US INTO THE FUTURE WELL WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER MODELS. THE THE THE SERVICES AND WORKFORCE CAPACITY AREA THAN BY THE WAY I WAS ASKED TO COMMENT ON THINGS THAT. WE THINK MIGHT BE PROBLEMATIC OR NEED FIXING IN THE NEW WAY FOR IN. OTHER RELATED ITEMS LIKE THAT SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING -- THE ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE HUB AND SPOKE THE OPIATE DOLLARS THAT HAVE COME IN THE CALIFORNIA. BAR WITH OUT A DOUBT THE SINGLE GREATEST EXPANSION OF SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES I THANK THE STATE HAS EVER SEEN IS FANTASTIC. THE BREADTH OF THE CONTINUING IS FANTASTIC. HAVING SAID THAT WE HAVEN'T SOLVED THE ACCESS PROBLEM YET. SOME OF THE EARLIER DISCUSSIONS WERE POINTING OUT 97% COVERAGE OF THE MEDI CAL POPULATION DOES NOT MEAN 967% ACCESS OF THOSE WHO NEED ASH JUDY GET S. U. D. SERVICES -- RESIDENTIAL SERVICES -- WHILE THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS GROWTH WE NEED A THIRD ROW THAT -- CAPACITY -- AND THAT'S NOT AN EASY TASK TO DO SPECIALLY UNDER THE COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM THERE'S NO WAY. TO HAVE A SURPLUS TO REINVEST IN THAT KIND OF EXPANSION -- SO WE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT A FURTHER -- UP ONE OF THE GREATEST -- ITEMS THAT HAMSTRING OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE ACCESS IS WORK FORCE YOU FOR TO TOUCH LONG -- WE WE ARE IN A SORT OF A CRISIS STATE WITH THE WORK FORCE RESCUE DO SERVICES. THAT USED TO BE THAT THE ONLY FOLKS THAT WANTED AN ISSUE THE OF SOMEONE WORKING IN THE ISSUE THE FIELD THAT WAS CERTIFIED. WAS THE ISSUE THE PROVIDER -- TODAY EVERYBODY WANTS THEM HEALTH PLANS WANT THEM HOSPITALS WANT THEM -- SCHOOLS WANT THEM -- AND OF COURSE A MENTAL HEALTH WANTS THEM AND OF COURSE WE NEED THEM IN THE SUBSTANCE USE REAL -- THIS SO IT IT IS IN A CRISIS STATE OR WE BELIEVE WE NEED A SINGLE STATE AGENCY TO HANDLE CERTIFICATION. I AM PERHAPS LICENSURE OF NG THAT ON TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS NOT BEEN A VERY POSITIVE THING OVERALL WE HAD TEN INITIALLY CERTIFYING ORGANIZATIONS. UP UNTIL YESTERDAY WE WERE DOWN TO TWO OF THE DEPARTMENT FORTUNATELY APPROVED THE REINSTATEMENT OF A THIRD SO WE'RE BACK UP -- TO THREE BUT IT'S IT'S JUST IT'S NOT ADEQUATE IT'S GOT ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS WE THINK CAN BE FIXED THROUGH A SINGLE STATE AGENCY OVERSIGHT. AND HOPE TO WORK WITH SOME A FEW OF GOING FORWARD TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES WHICH ARE A BENEFIT UNDER THE NEW ODS SYSTEM. A VERY IMPORTANT BENEFIT -- WE THINK NEEDS FURTHER -- DEFINITION AND SOME FURHER SUPPORT TO USE A WORK FORCE THAT HAS LIVED EXPERIENCE. NOT CERTIFIED OR LICENSED KIND OF EXPERIENCE. THERE IS A PROCESS FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BUT IT REQUIRES COUNTIES IN THEIR PLANS TO IDENTIFY UP. A TRAINING PROGRAM -- FOR WORK FORCE -- AND MANY COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE BAND WITH THE DO THAT SO THEY FALL BACK ON WE CAN DELIVER RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES SO LONG SINCE OF REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED COUNSELOR OR A LICENSED PRACTITIONER THE HEALING ARTS. WHILE THAT PULLS WORK FORCE AWAY FROM THE COURT TREATMENT TO DO RECOVERY SUPPORT SERVICES FURTHER AGGRAVATING THAT PROBLEM AND WE THINK THAT. LIVED EXPERIENCE NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED AS PART OF RECOVERY SUPPORT AND HOPE TO HAVE MORE DIALOGUE ABOUT THAT. THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS. ADMINISTRATIVE. BURDENS AS PART OF THE ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THEM ALL SOME OF THEM ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT SOME OF THEM WE CAN BE SMARTER ABOUT -- DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AROUND MEDICAL NECESSITY AND ASSESSMENT THE REST OF THAT. WITH MUCH MORE STANDARDIZATION AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO THAT EACH AND EVERY COUNTY DOESN'T DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT OR PILE ON TOP OF WE CAN GET SMARTER ABOUT THAT MINIMIZE THAT BURDEN ON THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY. SO THAT WORK FORCE CAN BE USE FOR WHAT IT'S THERE -- FOR SOARING THE POPULATION. SO WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT WITH COUNTIES ON THE DEPARTMENT. THERE ARE THINGS LIKE YOU MUST CREDENTIAL STAFF SO THE PROVIDER STAFF HAVE TO BE CREDENTIALED BY THE QUOTE ON QUOTE HEALTH PLAN THAT'S THE COUNTY. WILL OF ONE COUNTY CREDENTIALS MY WORK FORCE. THAT SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE FOR ANY OTHER COUNTY I MIGHT DO BUSINESS WITH. EACH COUNTY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN FOR THE SAME SET OF STAFF IT'S JUST. IT'S AN ENORMOUS BURDEN AND SO THE BURDEN ON THE COUNTY ON THE PROVIDERS AND THE WORK FORCE -- THAT WE THINK WE CAN DO THINGS SMARTER ABOUT -- A IT JUST ONE EXAMPLE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS THERE IS MANDATORY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS IF MY STAFF GET THAT MANDATORY TRAINING AND COUNTY HEY. FOR A SAM ASSESSMENTS OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE. THAT SHOULD BE. ABLE TO BE CARRIED OVER TO THE NEXT COUNTY. GROUP SIZE THE GROUP SIZE IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- IN MY READ IS SPELLED OUT AT TWO TO FOURTEEN FOR CLINICAL GROUP -- BUT IN PRACTICE IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN STATE RAGS IT'S TWO TO TWELVE BUT WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT TO TO FOURTEEN THAT'S IN TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND BRACED. IMMEDIATELY -- I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WAS AMENDED BUT I CAN FIND NO AMENDED VERSION -- THAT IT WAS AMENDED TO TO TO TWELVE IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WE IN FACT WOULD RECOMMEND IN THE RENEWAL THAT THAT GET MOVED. TO TO TO SIXTEEN HERE AGAIN FROM AN ACCESS STANDPOINT THE MORE LIMITED WE ARE ON THE SIZE OF THAT GROUP. THE MORE WE LIMIT ACCESS AND I DON'T THINK IN MOST OF THE FOLKS I SPEAK WITH DON'T THINK WE LOSE ANYTHING AND THE QUALITY OF THOSE GROUPS. BECAUSE IT GOES UP BY A COUPLE FOLKS IN FACT MANY OF THEM TO BE YOU YOU CAN'T GO OVER WHEN YOU BOOK IT. TO TWELVE AND HALF THE TIME YOU'RE RUNNING GROUPS WITH TWO TO TEN BECAUSE OF NO SHOWS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. WE THINK THERE'S ROOM THERE -- THE OF THE JUST KEEP GOING HERE OF WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT. THERE WAS A LOT OF EXPANSION WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT ONE OF THE PLACES THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE. THE EXPANSION BUT A TREMENDOUS MADE. ISN'T THREE POINT SEVEN AND FOUR POINT ALL. HIGHER ACUITY WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT POPULATION -- IT'S HOSPITAL BASED -- WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT -- THERE IS NEXT TO NO CAPACITY. ALL THE COUNTIES RECOGNIZE THAT SO WE THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON THE BUT WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO LEVERAGE THE E. P. STT BENEFIT MUCH BETTER THAN WE DO TODAY IS PART OF ALL. OF INTEGRATING THAT WITH THE ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM IT'S PARTICULARLY CRUCIAL -- FOR YOU SERVICES. THERE ARE SERVICES IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS PAT OF THE CONTINUING THAT HAVE BEEN SPELLED OUT. THAT ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE BOARD COUNTY BY COUNTY. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IN MY NOTES THAT YOU'LL GET IS TELEHEALTH -- IT IS NOT. BEEN BRACED BY EVERY COUNTY -- TELEHEALTH WAS PUT IN THERE AGAIN. TO BOB HELP WITH ACCESS. TO CARE AND IF IT'S NOT. UTILIZE WE CAN'T MAKE THAT HEADLINE. ONE OF THE GREATEST BURDENS FOR PROVIDERS EHR SYSTEM. IF YOU DO BUSINESS WITH -- ONE COUNTY IT'S ONE THING IF YOU DO BUSINESS WITH MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND UNDER THE ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND BECAUSE OF COUNTY OF RESIDENCE FOR SERVICE. THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT TO DO BUSINESS WITH MORE THAN ONE COUNTY. EACH COUNTY HAS AN EXPECTATION THAT YOU EMBRACE THEIR EHR SYSTEM. REGARDLESS OF YOUR OWN EHR SYSTEM. AND MUCH OF THE TIME TAKE NO STEPS TO DEVELOPING THE PROPER INTERFACES BETWEEN ONE H. R. SYSTEM ANDTHE OTHER SO DATA CAN BE PROPERLY EXCHANGED. AND THE COST AND THE DOUBLE TRIPLE DATA ENTRY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AGAIN. SOMETHING WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT WE JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON DOING IT. IT REALLY DETRACTS FROM THE PRIMARY PURPOSES -- THAT POINT ON A RESIDENTIAL CARE IS ALSO IN MY NOTES WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THIS. OF CURRENT STRUCTURE ON RESIDENTIAL AND PROVIDE THAT BENEFIT. THE FULL OF SPAN OF DAYS TIED FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY AND NOT THIS TO BUY THE APPLE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE TODAY AND THERE -- IT'S CONSTRAINING SO I MENTIONED THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE AND COUNTY OF SERVICE ISSUE. THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN OF A HUGE ADVOCATE HELPING. RESOLVE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH COUNTIES ARE STILL TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS WITH IT. EVEN IF YOU GET MULTIPLE COUNTY CONTRACTS YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY IN A RESIDENTIAL BED FROM. OF COUNTY A IN YOUR SERVANT COUNTY BE. IF THEY NEED GENERAL HEALTH CARE. YOU CAN'T PROVIDE IN THAT COUNTY YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTY OF ORIGIN. IF THEY NEED A PRESCRIPTION YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTY OF ORIGIN -- WE HAVE TO REVISIT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE I THINK STILL. AND LASTLY THE HUB AND SPOKE -- BUT MY COMMENT ON THAT IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. WE ALL HOPE AND PRAY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT FOR THE HUB AND SPOKE PROJECTS ARE OPIATE EXPANSION IN THE STATE. BUT IF IN FACT THEY DON'T. WELL WE ALL PRAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION. STEP UP AND THE FIGURE OUT A FIX FOR THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU OFFER THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES SOME MEMBER RAMOS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DO HAVE TO RUN TO ANOTHER -- HEARING BUT I DO WANT TO BRING UP -- YOU MENTIONED YOU WORKING WITH A TRAVEL COMMUNITIES -- OUT IN YOUR AREA HUMBOLDT COUNTY AND I SING SOME IN THERE AS FAR AS LAKE COUNTY. AND YOU MENTIONED -- FIVE DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUPS I THINK THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND AND SOME OF THE THE THE ROAD BLOCKS AND MAYBE YOU HAVE SEEN IN IN TRYING TO BRING AWARENESS TO THAT COMMUNITY. YEAH I'M IN THE BEGINNING WE REACHED OUT TO THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN ALL SIX OF OUR REGIONS TO SHARE THE GRANT AND SHOW WHAT RESOURCES WE CAN BRING WHAT I NOTICED WAS HELPFUL WAS BRINGING IN A LOCAL FROM THEIR COMMUNITY THAT NEW THEM THAT WAS ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE GRANT -- AND WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME MORE SUPPORT BECAUSE BEING AN OUTSIDER -- IT'S VERY HARD TO DO THAT SO WE DID BRING A FEW EXPERTS IN FROM THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THROUGH OPIOID COALITIONS THROUGH PROVIDER MEETINGS THAT WERE WILLING AND VERY INTERESTED IN HELPING US. ONCE WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT -- THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS ARE NOW GROWING IN EACH ONE OF THOSE MATT PROGRAMS AND MORE AND MORE PATIENTS ARE COMING IN FROM THE NATIVE COMMUNITY -- BARRIERS ARE STILL STIGMA BARRIERS ARE STILL -- ACCESS BUT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT WITH TRAINING AND COMMUNICATION REUSING TRIBAL LIAISONS -- TO DELIVER THAT INFORMATION ONCE WE TRAIN THEM AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAN I DO APOLOGIZE TO BOTH CHAIRS -- HAVING TO RUN OUT BUT AS WE GET TO THE NEXT TOPIC AS FAR AS PLANNING -- FURTHER OUT REACH IF WE COULD TAKE SOME OF THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE START TO MOVE FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ON THANK YOU BYE THANK YOU WHEN WE KNOW PEOPLE TO GO IN THE HOUSE OF THE US AND RUBIO. IT WAS A GOOD MORNING WHILE THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK HERE. IN PARTICULAR I BELIEVE IT WAS -- MISTER HARRIS YOU DISCUSS STUFF ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TWENTY FOUR HOUR HTLINE -- I BELIEVE YOU STATED THAT THERE IS TWO HUNDRED CALLS THAT YOU WENT TO FOUR THOUSAND CALLS HE GIVE ME A SENSE OF HOW MANY OF THOSE CALLS INTO SERVICE AND HOW MANY DID YOU NOT AND IF PEOPLE CALL FOR ASSISTANCE WERE YOU ABLE TO REFORM IF YOU CAN HANDLE. THEM YOURSELF -- YES WE WILL WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE GETTING INTO. WHEN WE OPEN THE LINE UP AND WENT LIFE? AND SO MANY OF THOSE CALLS THAT COME IN -- OR INFORMATIONAL CALLS THEY'RE LOOKING -- FOR ALL KIND OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND WILL WILL PROVIDE THE INFORMATION WILL PROVIDE LOCAL RESOURCES A EXCEPT TRUCK -- WE AT FIRST WERE LOSING. ABOUT 8% OF THE CALLS BECAUSE THEY WERE ON HOLD FOR SO LONG AND AND I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN OUR A LOS CALL PERCENTAGE DOWN TO ABOUT TWO OR 3% RIGHT NOW. WHICH IS IS INITIALLY STARTED WITH -- THREE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ANSWERING CALLS AND TO ETS THAT WERE SCREENING THE CALLS AND WE'VE SINCE HAD TO GO TO I BELIEVE TEN I INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ANSWERING THE CALLS AND FOR A SET OF OUR OFFICE ASSISTANCE THAT SCREEN THE CALLS COMING IN -- FORCE IT'S STILL NOT PERFECT BUT WE'RE WE'RE GETTING THERE WE BOUGHT IT A A NEW -- CALL SYSTEM TO HELP WITH THAT PROCESS -- IS SO. AND AGAIN WE STILL GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS LIKE -- WORSE THE CLOSEST PIZZA PARLOR DECK KIND OF STUFF AND WE'LL TRY TO DO THE BEST WE CAN BUT IT'S HARD WHEN YOU GET STUFF LIKE THAT COMING AND SO. THANK YOU -- I MISTER SAID NOW I HOPE I'M SAYING YOUR NAME CORRECTLY I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU AS WELL YOU DISCUSS THE CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF CREDENTIALING. GOING FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER COUNTY CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT THE CREDENTIALING PROCESS IS HOW MANY MINDS WHAT IT'S REQUIRED. CAN YOU TALK FURTHER ON THAT SHOW TO DO THIS WITH A STAFF THAT THEY NEED -- TO VERIFY EDUCATION LICENSURE BACKGROUND -- SO IT'S THAT KIND OF INFORMATION YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH REPEATED TIMES THAT. WE THINK IT'S PRETTY STANDARDIZED IN THAT. IF IT'S DONE IN ONE PLACE. AND APPROVED IT SHOULD BE USABLE ELSEWHERE. SO TO THAT QUESTION IS THERE ARE YOU DO NOT HAVE A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM THAT TRACKS EVERYONE. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE MY TEACHER SO IF I GO FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL DISTRICT RIGHT THREE BUT A LOOK TO SEE IN THE SYSTEM THAT I'M. AT A CREDENTIALED TEACHER DO YOU GUYS HAVE A CENTRALIZED THERE IS THERE ARE NO SUCH CENTRALIZED SYSTEM IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT I AM WARE OF CERTAINLY NOT UNDER THE O. D. S.. THERE IS SUCH A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- BUT EVEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR NOT ALL HEALTH PLANS UTILIZED. SOME DO SOME DON'T. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND LAST QUESTION FOR YOU I'M SORRY IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION. ARE YOU WERE DISCUSSING I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NEXT SALON DISTRIBUTION I THINK YOU TALKED ABOUT IT. THANK YOU AND ARE YOU ALSO SAID IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND TWO REPORTED REVERSALS CAN YOU EXPLAIN. TO THAT WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IS THE RIVER SO PROCESS ANALOG SON IS AT LIFESAVING MEDICATION AT PROVIDES A REVERSAL FROM AN OPIATE OVERDOSE. AND SO FOR HUMBOLDT COUNTY SPECIFICALLY WE PROVIDED IT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT COALITION MEMBERS PROVIDERS FOR COMMUNITY EVENTS AND FOR COMMUNITY ACCESS -- LAW ENFORCEMENT CARRIES THAT ON HAND WITH THEM OUT IN THE FIELD -- THE TWO HUNDRED INTO REVERSALS WERE POOR HATCHER WHICH IS A COMMUNITY I'M RESOURCE CENTER AND THOSE REVERSALS WERE REPORTED FROM OVERDOSES AND ACTION WORD THAN OUR CAN WITH UTILIZED. SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT IN PARTICULAR YOU SAID LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THERE ANY BODY ELSE THAT'S QUALIFY. TO TO HAVE IT OR DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF CREDENTIAL TO HOLD THAT KIND OF MEDICATION YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE A CREDENTIAL TO HOLD THAT MEDICATION IF YOU ARE ASKING FOR THE NALOXONE. THROUGH THIS FEDERAL GRANT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU -- BUT WE GO INTO THE COMMUNITY BE PROVIDE THE TRAINING -- AND HAND OUT AS MANY AS WE CAN PROVIDE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. TO PERSONAL THANK YOU TO ALL THREE OF YOU FOR THIS INFORMATION IT'S IT'S REAL I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY VALUABLE AND I THINK IT HIGHLIGHTS SOME SOME REAL SERIOUS CHALLENGES WE HAVE -- AND DELIVERY OF THESE SERVICES SO -- BACK TO THE CHALLENGES HUMBLE HUMBLE COUNTY I KNOW WELL -- AND YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU SEE SAID IN YOUR SLIDE YOU HAD -- HAVE THE WAIVER [inaudible] YET. AMONG THOSE 7%. HOW MANY DID YOU SAY ARE ACTUALLY USING THAT WAY? FOR WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL 7% ARE USING NOT -- THE MOST RECENT DATA THAT WE HAVE IS AN UPDATED BUT ALL PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM HOWEVER WE'RE GETTING THAT DATA FROM THE URBAN INSTITUTE I'M OUT OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE ALL PROVIDERS HAVE NOT BEEN USING THEIR WAIVERS TO MAXIMUM CAPACITY OR SOME OF THEM ARE. CLOSETED PROVIDERS WHERE THEY'RE NOT UTILIZING THE WAIVERS AT ALL. IS SO WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE IMPEDIMENT IS THAT WHAT WE HEARD FROM OUR OUR RESEARCHER BEFORE. THAT THEY'RE NOT CONFIDENT OR OTHER DATA FEELING HAVE THE MENTORSHIP OR THEY'RE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT LIABILITY I MEAN WHAT DO YOU SEEN AND AND I'VE ASKED SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS MYSELF AND I'M GETTING A A FEW THEMES. ARE SOME OF THE THEMES THAT I'VE HEARD ARE YOU KNOW BEING I'M HAVING THE FLOODGATES OPEN AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH THIS BEING A NEW SPECIALTY -- JUST THAT GENERAL FEAR OF STARTING MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT SOME PROVIDERS HAVE THE LICENSE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEIR PRIMARY SPECIALTY IS AND SO JUMPING ON BOARD HAS BEEN REALLY HARD HOW WE'VE BEEN TACKLING THAT. IS THROUGH OUR EXPERT FACILITATORS AND HUMBLE WE'RE WORKING WITH DOCTOR COUNTY STOCKTON AND SHE OFFER SUPPORT TO THE NEW PROVIDERS IN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND WALK THEM THROUGH IT SHE'S BEEN DOING MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR TEN YEARS AND IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE. THROUGH HER HELP AND SUPPORT SPEAKING FROM ONE PROVIDER TO ANOTHER PROVIDER WITHIN THEIR LANGUAGE WE'VE BEEN GAVE GETTING SOME MORE AND MORE ON BOARD -- BUT IT IS A PROCESS. SO YOU ALSO MENTIONED YOU HAVE BUT EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT COULD UTILIZE HERS BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCESS SO. SO -- IS THAT ARE YOU SEEING THAT IN OTHER COUNTIES AS WELL OR IS THIS OR IS THIS A HIGHER. PERCENTAGE IN HUMBLE COUNTY THAN THROUGHOUT SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTY SITUATION WHERE I AM SEEING THAT THROUGHOUT ALL SIX OF OUR GRANT REGIONS -- HUMBLE IS A HIGH PERCENTAGE GIVEN HOW ROLE SO MANY OF THE AREAS ARE AND SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS WITH TRANSPORTATION AND ASSISTANCE. YOU ARE ALSO AND I NOTED THAT -- ON ONE OF THE EARLIER SLIDES IN THE FIRST OUR FIRST PRESENTATION THERE WAS NO SPOKE TO DOWN OR COUNTY. BUT THERE IS WITH YOU SOMEONE IN THE MUST BE A LAG IN THE DATA OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THAT WAS JANUARY NINETEEN REPORT AND YOU HAVE A SPOKE BUT IT WHAT DIDN'T SHOW UP IN THE OTHER DATA S HUMBOLDT ACTUALLY ARE ONLY TERRITORY WHERE WE DON'T. HAVE A PHYSICAL HUB AT THIS MOMENT -- ALL OF OUR OTHER GRANTS HAVE A PHYSICAL HUB WE ARE OPENING UP A CLINIC IN YOUR RICA EITHER LATER THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT YEAR WHICH WILL OPERATE AS THE HUB TO HUMBLE. BUT AT THIS POINT WE'VE CONNECTED ALL OF OUR SPOKES TO EXPERT FACILITATORS AND WE'RE CREATING A MEDICAL NEIGHBORHOOD. EVEN THOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL HALBERSTAM. SO WHAT IS THE IMPEDIMENT TO A HUB IN HUMBLE COUNTY. I'M AT THIS POINT WE THE HOPE IS TO OPEN -- I HAVE BEEN HUMBOLDT COUNTY QUESTION. BUT SO I'M CURIOUS WHERE WHERE IS THE REASON AND I AYE AND PHYSICAL I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BUT WHAT WHAT MAKES IT SO CHALLENGING TO CREATE A HUB IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. WHAT ARE THE FACTORS OUT THERE -- LEADING TO ABOUT I THINK THE CHALLENGE -- LIES WITHIN THE SAME CHARGES THAT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO WITH THE STIGMA -- AND THE BARRIERS FOR CHANGE AND EXCEPTION I'LL OF KNOWING THAT THIS TREATMENT IS NEEDED -- OPEN DOORS BEEN THERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND BEEN PROVIDING THIS MEDICATION AND THIS I TREATMENT TO THE COMMUNITY ABOUT HAVING ANOTHER -- ORGANIZATION COMMAND HAS BEEN -- A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT AND SO WE ARE ADDRESSING NOT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND WE'VE NOW BEEN WELCOMED. AND SO THE HOPE IS TO BE ABLE TO IT ADDRESS THAT IMPEDIMENT WITHOUT OPENING. IN MY FINAL QUESTIONS ACTUALLY TO ALL OF YOUR LIKE YOU TO TOUCH ON THIS. TREATMENT OF YOUTH [inaudible] PERCENTAGE EFFECTIVENESS -- I THINK YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE OVERDOSES HAPPEN WITH PEOPLE IN OLD THAT ARE OLDER -- NOT ALL OBVIOUSLY SO BUT OVER DOES THIS HAPPEN WITH YOUNG PEOPLE -- WHO MAY NOT BE ADDICTED OR OR DEPENDENT AT THAT POINT SO TELL ME ABOUT HOW YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH USE AND HOW THESE PROGRAMS WORKING WITH THE YOUTH AND I LOOKED FOR ALL THE BILL TOUCH ON THAT? SO WHAT I CAN SPEAK TO IT I I AM -- OF A USE OF PROVIDER. BOTH RESIDENTIAL OUTPATIENT SERVICES FOR YOU. WE ARE BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE ON NEED -- AND OF THERE IS TREMENDOUS THE NILE. OF HIM FAMILIES. WELL WITH PARENTS LOVED ONES. SCHOOL SYSTEMS WELFARE SYSTEMS FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS. AROUND THE NEED FOR SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES WITH YOU -- THEY WOULD RATHER TALK ABOUT THEIR ACADEMIC ISSUES SOME OTHER BEHAVIORAL ISSUES EVEN MENTAL HEALTH. THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS -- SO IS IT IT IS PERVASIVE IN SOME OF THOSE SYSTEMS. BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE THEM AND GET THEM. TO HELP IDENTIFY SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN GET INTO SCHOOLS. BECAUSE I DON'T ALWAYS OPEN THEIR ARMS TO LET YOU IN -- YEAH YOU CAN HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTACT -- IN TERMS OF THAT IDENTIFICATION -- AND AND MAKE SOME GOOD HEADWAY BUT IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WE DO NOT HAVE A GOOD SYSTEM OF CARE IN THE STATE OF FOR ADOLESCENTS SERVICES -- IT PROP SIXTY FOUR RESPONSE TO GENERATE REVENUE SOONER OR LATER THAT -- GETS EARMARKED -- FOR A TREATMENT AND PREVENTION SERVICES MORE HOPING THAT. SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES WILL HELP BUILD. A YOUTH -- CONTINUE ON BUT JUST AS WE HOPE THAT THE ORGAN E. P. STT WILL HELP WITH THAT EFFORT. AND BOTH OF THEM ARE HELPING WITH THAT BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT QUITE A WAYS TO GO. YEAH -- AS FAR AS RIVERSIDE COUNTY GOES ON UP UNTIL LAST YEAR WE DID NOT HAVE A A FACILITY WITHIN THE COUNTY THAT WOULD TREAT -- PRESIDENTIAL ADOLESCENTS WE WOULD SEND HIM. TO TO TARZANA AND WE DID HAVE ONE PROVIDER DAT. OPENED UP A RESERVE A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY LAST YEAR -- FOR SIX BOYS SIX GIRLS OUT IN THE COULD SHALLOW VALLEY. THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITY CARE -- LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND IT WAS KIND OF A A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A DIFFICULT PROCESS TO GET THEM UP UP AND RUNNING BUT WE DO HAVE THAT NOW. WE HAVE A LOT OF OUTPATIENT. TREATMENT FACILITIES -- FOR FOR USE UNDER UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WE ALSO ARE WORKING. WITH OUR IN OUR PREVENTION PROGRAM TO TREAT HIGH RISK -- INDIVIDUALS AND SO WE HAVE A COUNTY BASED. INDIVIDUAL PREVENTION SERVICES PROGRAM THAT WORK WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE STARTED TO HAVE SOME NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH DRUGS OR ALCOHOL BUT HAVEN'T REACHED LEVEL TO WEAR A DIAGNOSIS IS WARRANTED. AND THAT SERVICE IS AVAILABLE AT ALL TEN OF OUR COUNTY OPERATED A SUBSTANCE ABUSE CLINICS -- IT'S A HOME GROWN A PROGRAM THAT -- WE'VE RECEIVED NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR AN ADDENDUM VALUATION PROCESS WHAT IT. AND CURRENTLY -- WITH THE ADVENT OF THE ODS WAIVER WE RUN A PILOT PROJECT WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO EXPAND THAT SERVICES DIRECTLY INTO SOME OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. WE'RE ACTIVE AND FIVE OF OUR TO WHERE WE WILL PLACE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELOR INTO -- THE DISTRICT. TO PROVIDE TO EITHER TO PREVENTION INTERVENTION OR THE TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS SO WE'RE TRYING O BE AS ACTIVE AS WE CAN -- WITH THIS STUFF. BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WERE SEEN WITH THE HOUSTON ARE COUNTY IS AROUND MARIJUANA -- AS FAR AS OPIATES GO IT'S NOT PRESENTED ITSELF IS A HUGE PROBLEM YET ON THE UNDER SEVENTEEN POPULATION HOWEVER DE. THE EIGHTEEN THROUGH TWENTY FOUR OUR POPULATION IS WHERE WE'RE SEEING. SOME OF THE BIGGEST GROWTH THERE. THROUGH THE HAVEN'T SPOKE WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR COALITIONS TO ADDRESS YOUTH EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS AND DURING COMMUNITY EVENTS -- WE'VE NOTICED IN SOME OF OUR ROLE COMMUNITIES THAT -- OPIOIDS ARE TO THE CONCERNED IT IS MARIJUANA AND SOME OTHER ILLICIT SUBSTANCES HOWEVER -- THROUGHOUT THE REGIONS THAT WE ARE WORKING AND MEANT FOR YOUTH ISN'T VERY COMMON EITHER SO I DO AGREE THAT ADOLESCENT -- CARE IN THIS SYSTEM IS LACKING. I HAVE A QUESTION. I'M THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. IT'S TO GOING INTO THE SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE SERVICES -- CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEING RECEPTIVE OR EIGHT GETTING IN. SOME KIND OF RESISTANCE INTO GOING INTO THE SITES I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE BOAT. OKAY -- I'M SORRY I COULDN'T GO TO WHOEVER OKAY. I AM SIXTY WE HAVE BOTH WE HAVE DISTRICTS THAT ARE BEGGING FOR THE SERVICE AND THEN WE HAVE DISTRICTS THAT WANT NOTHING. TO DO WITH US SO ONE OF THE WAYS AROUND IT IS WE HAD AN ANIMAL YOU WITH OUR SELF Là GRAHAM -- AND ANY DISTRICTS THAT ARE COVERED THROUGH DAM. WE OFFER THE SERVICES AND THAT AND WHAT YOU COVERS AT A TO SO. I THINK YEAH. HEALTH AND I WANNA THANK. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE PREFIGURE TESTIMONY HAD FEW QUESTIONS AS WELL -- SO FIRST OF ALL -- DR -- KHWAJA YOU HAD MADE REFERENCE TO OF COURSE THE WORK FORCE CHALLENGES WE KNOW HUMBLED HAS A WORK FOR SHORTAGE BUT IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTING WORK FOR SHUTTERS GEORGE NUMBER PROVIDERS YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT. YOU HAVE PROVIDERS. TO THE WHO WELL WE WE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE BEING TRAINED AND NOT ACTUALLY DELIVERING -- I CAN YOU AN AND ACTUALLY I THINK -- THE THE EVALUATORS HAD MENTIONED ONE OF THE REASONS MAY HAVE BEEN ALSO -- PEOPLE ARE AFRAID THAT IF THEY STARTED PRESCRIBING THE MIGHT FACE SOME PENALTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- HE SPEAK TO THE BARRIERS WE MIGHT DO IS A LEGISLATURE SO FOR EXAMPLES OR SOMETHING THE MEDICAL BOARD NEEDS TO DO TO TELL PEOPLE THAT IF YOU PRESCRIBE AN AFRO AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE YOUR LICENSE IS THAT AN ISSUE OUT THERE. CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT -- KEEP PEOPLE FROM WHO SAY OKAY I WANT TO HEALTH AND I DO THE TRAINING --% I DO THE TRAINING BUT THEN AND UP NOT ACTUALLY -- YOU MENTIONED THAT PEOPLE KNOW EITHER THEY DO A LITTLE MORE THAT WAS A WHAT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO HELP THEM THEY'RE THINK SPEAKING UP AS A MEDICAL BOARDTO LET THESE PROVIDERS NOT ALL THAT THIS IS AYE AYE NECESSITY TO INTEGRATE THIS INTO PRIMARY. CARE IS WHAT WE NEED HERE -- IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL I HAVE HEARD -- SECONDHAND FROM PROVIDERS THAT THEY HAVE HEARD THAT YOU KNOW D. A. HAS COME IN AND DONE YOU KNOW THIS OR THAT AND BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE SCARED OF LOSING THEIR LICENSE BUT I DON'T KNOW OTHER PROVIDER SPECIFICALLY IN THE SIX REGIONS I'M WORKING WITH -- BUT IT IS A COMMON FEAR EVEN THOUGH IT'S HEARSAY AMONGST THEM AND BEING THE ONLY ONE IN THE COMMUNITY YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONE THAT'S TARGETED IS WHAT THAT THE THOUGHT IS. OKAY SO SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. WITH OBVIOUS DA'S FEDERAL BUT WE HAVE FRIENDS IN OUR FEDERAL THAT SO WE NEED TO WORK WITH PEOPLE AND UPS COURSE THE MEDICAL YOU KNOW THAT MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS AS WELL ABOUT SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT. YOU CAN DO THIS YOU CAN DO THIS SAFELY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE YOUR LICENSE AND PERHAPS WE NEED A REGULATORY AGENCIES TO MAKE FIRMER STATEMENTS ABOUT -- FOR THAT FOR PROVIDERS WHO ARE WHO ARE ENGAGING IN AND TREATMENT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THE MORE MORE WE TALK ABOUT IT THE MORE AND MORE WE SEE PROVIDERS COMING ON BOARD THAT WEREN'T THERE A YEAR AGO OR TWO YEARS AGO AND SO THE CONVERSATION IS NECESSARY. FOR THAT THAT'S A VERY HELPFUL -- I HEARD YOU SING THE PRAISES OF OF THE THE OF YOU KNOW. THOUGH YES SAID THE IN THE THE NEED FOR A PROCESS -- BUT WE ALSO HEARD AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT I THINK IT IS FROM WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT HEARING THIS IS BETTER THAN WHAT WE WERE DOING BEFORE SO WITH SO -- BUT WE ALSO HEARD THAT WE'RE ONLY REACHING A FRY A FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE I REALIZE IS A CHALLENGING POPULATION -- WHAT DO YOU SEE SO YOU I YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU ACTUALLY INCREASE TREATMENT BY 80% NUMBER OF PEOPLE SO ACTUALLY US OF THAT SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE AT THE AVERAGE 7%? BECAUSE YOU'RE AT 80% I REALLY OUT THE WAY EVERYONE ELSE WAS AT SO -- SUIT CLEARLY VERY SUCCESSFUL RIVERSIDE. COUNTY BUT WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP -- FURS SO WILL THE WAIVERS GONNA COME UP WHAT HE SEES THE NEXT STEP SO WE CAN REACH EVEN MORE PEOPLE -- I IS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN RIVERSIDE YOU GOT IT ALL TAKEN CARE OF OR JUST A LONG WAY TO GO. AND WHAT TO WHICH WE BE DOING TO HELP YOUR COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES THAT TO YOUR COLLEAGUES TO TRY TO TO STEP IT UP AND GET YOUR PEOPLE. THERE IS STILL A LOT MORE TO DO -- TREATMENT IS WE WERE FINALLY PAYING THE RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS WHAT THEY WERE WORSE. PREVIOUSLY WE WERE ONLY. ABLE TO PAY THEM SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTY DOLLARS A DAY. AND THE PROVIDERS WEREN'T WILLING TO GIVE THE COUNTY OF MORE THAN JUST A FEW BADS NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE. TO PAY THEM A REASONABLE -- DAILY RATE AND SO TO THE PROVIDERS WERE DâN MORE THAN WILLING TO OPEN MORE BEDS FOR THE COUNTY TO USE AND SO THAT. MUCH ATTRIBUTED FOR THAT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH THERE -- I THINK AS LONG AS WE ARE ABLE. TO CONTINUE TO PAY OUR PROVIDERS -- WHAT THEY'RE WORTH AND -- IF WE CAN EXPAND THE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL -- MANY OF THE PRIVATE PROVIDERS DON'T WANNA PLAY WITH THE THEY CAN GET MORE FROM -- SOME OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT THEY WORK WITH SO -- I I THINK. THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPACT US BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY NOWHERE NEAR -- TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN REST ON OUR LAURELS YET. AND LESS THAN LA KNOW THAT -- LOOKING FOR TO GET A COPY OF YOUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY YOU TOUCH ON MANY DIFFERENT TOPICS -- GET THROUGH ALL OF THEM BY BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS INTERESTED THOSE YOU MENTIONED TERMS OF RESIDENTIAL CAPACITY AND NOW WE DO COST BASED. REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND YOU THAT MAKE REMARKS THAT WELL OF COURSE THAT MEANS THAT IF WE DO COST BASE TO COVER THE COSTS BUT THERE'S NO CAPITAL FOR FURTHER. EXPANSION RIGHT -- NOW I THINK IT MAY BE A CHALLENGE TO SAY WHICH IS GOOD NOW I HAVE TO DEAL INCREASE RATES SO THAT YOU CAN ACCUMULATE THAT CAPITAL RIGHT AT THE THAT ARE THERE OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR EXAMPLE IS LIKE A REVOLVING CAPITAL FUND THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BUILD SO THAT THEY CAN -- EXPAND OUR OF A IT IS SOME THOUGHTS. BEYOND JUST INCREASING I MEAN WE WANT TO PAY AN APPROPRIATE RATE NIGHT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT -- BUT IT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY WHERE THE BARRIERS TO BUILDING THAT RESIDENTIAL CAPACITY TALKED ABOUT. CHAU -- BEYOND THE ISSUES WITH OF FINDING APPROPRIATE FOR OLD FACILITIES IF YOU CAN FIND THE LAND. OR EXPAND EXISTING ONES IF YOU'VE GOT THE ABILITY TO EXPAND BY ADDING BEDS -- THE THERE THERE IS A REAL A REAL PROBLEM WITH. HERE'S A A REASONABLE RATE FOR THE BED DAY I'M BUYING FROM YOU. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THAT HUNDRED DOLLAR BED DAY I'M BUYING FROM YOU. YOU OPERATE VERY EFFICIENTLY AND COME IN AT NINETY DOLLARS YOU MUST GIVE ME THE TEN DOLLARS BACK. AND IF YOU END UP OF THE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. SPENDING A HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS. WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR DONATION NO ONE'S REIMBURSING YOU FOR THAT TEN DOLLARS -- WE COULD DESIGN -- COST BASED SYSTEM THAT ARE LEFT A MARGIN IF YOU. RAN EFFICIENT WAY AND THERE WAS A 10% OF 5% OR WHATEVER A SURPLUS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO RETAIN IT. SO LONG AS IT'S REINVESTED IN THAT MISSION THAT FURTHER INFRASTRUCTURE AND GROWTH KIND OF THING. THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT COULD BE HAVE AND WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER PAYMENT REFORM MODELS -- TO TO A MORE TRADITIONAL FEE FOR SERVICE -- IF IT'S A FAIR AND REASONABLE -- DOES A LOT OF STRAIGHT FORWARD FEE FOR SERVICE IF IT'S A REASONABLE RATE FOR FOR THAT SERVICE DRIVEN. FROM COST DATA TO SORT OF GET THERE THAT -- IT'S STRAIGHT FEE FOR SERVICES AND APPROACH WE CAN MARKET CASE RATES AND OTHER -- INCENTIVE OUTCOME BASED MODELS WHERE YOU YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT A REST GET YOUR BASE RATE BUT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO EARN MORE BY. OF BY -- AN INCENTIVE BASED PLAN THAT IS DRIVEN BY OUTCOMES THAT YOU'RE ACHIEVING CERTAIN DELIVERABLES AS PART OF THAT -- AND THAT'S THE KIND OF SERIOUS DISCUSSION THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THIS. SOME PROVIDERS ARE CAPABLE OF GOING OUT AND FINDING FINANCING -- IN TAKING THAT VERY BIG PLUNGE THAT RISK -- TO TO ADD BEDS -- BUT ALL IN ALL MANY ARE JUST NOT THERE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT THEY'RE SMALLER. OPERATORS NOT CAPABLE OKAY THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THAT YOU GIVE US SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR TRYING TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY ACROSS THE MULTIPLE GOVERNMENT ENTITIESAND SO FORTH WE SHOULD. WAIT WHAT MIGHT FOLLOW UP WITH SOME QUESTIONS WITH PANEL ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. THE REBELLION I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION I'M SORRY FOR THE LATE QUESTION BUT YOU KNOW JUST GOING BACK TO SARAH -- YOUR TEA SET OUT. A LOT OF THE PATIENTS ARE A COMMAND GET TREATMENT AND THEN THEY THEY FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TRANSPORTATION IT'S NOT CONSISTENT AND AND I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT IN ORDER TO GET BETTER YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONSISTENT TREATMENT -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING IN TERMS OF TRYING TO PROVIDE. THOUGHT TRANSPORTATION ANY PARTNERSHIPS ANY. WAY OF MAYBE UTILIZING FUNDING TO PARTNER WITH TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET PATIENTS THERE I'M JUST THINKING OF THAT RESOURCES WASTED IN TERMS OF AGAIN IF YOU GET TREATMENT AND YOU TO CONSISTENTLY SHOW UP IT'S A WASTE OF A RESOURCE IS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET. ANY BETTER SO CAN YOU SURE ABOUT ANY PARTNERSHIP OR ANYTHING THAT YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO DO. ONE OF THE ALLOWABLE EXPENSES THROUGH THE HUB AND SPOKE GRANT IS FOR TRANSPORTATION SO WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE GAS CARDS -- AND LIFT VOUCHERS UBER VOUCHERS TO PATIENTS BUS PASSES TO GET TO AND FROM TREATMENT WE KNOW SOME OF OUR SPOKE THEY'VE BEEN GONE AS FAR AS TO HIRING AYE DRIVER TO TO GO AND GET THE PATIENTS AND BRING THEM TO TREATMENT. ASIDE FROM THIS GRANT AS WELL AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO BE CREATIVE -- MAYBE EVEN SCHEDULING DAYS MET -- THAT ONE MONDAY OR THAT ONE TUESDAY SO THE FAN IS TAKING ALL OF THEM AND SO FORTH. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THANK YOU. OFFER YOUR PRESENTATIONS IT'S BEEN -- VERY INSIGHTFUL AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TAKE YOUR TIME SHARE WITH US THANK YOU. RIGHT WE'RE GONNA THE NEXT PANEL IS ON PLANS FOR EXPANDING PILOTS SINCE THE SERVICES NOW -- BECAUSE WE S. THE ONLY PEOPLE POWER YOUR BREAK IT UP INTO TWO PIECES. SO WE'RE FIRST GOING TO BRING UP A DOCTOR LEAST LOOK FROM THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY THE DICTION MEDICINE. IS GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT THE SALES EXPERIENCE IN TRAINING PHYSICIANS AND AND MEDICATIONS AS TREATMENT -- WE HAVE DOCTOR JOHN CONNALLY DIVISION DIRECTOR OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION CONTROL LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATIONS WE TALK ABOUT COUNTIES EXPERIENCES. FOR CONTRACTING AND WE HAVE A FOR AS HIS -- OF SUBSTANCE SE DISORDER COMPLIANCE BOTH OF THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO WELCOME AND THEN THE WE WILL BRING UP THE NEXT THREE SPEAKERS AND US. AND THE SEPARATE PANEL ON THE SAME TOPIC AS WELL SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WAITING FOR THAT ONE THAT WILL -- WILL BRING YOU UP -- NEXT SO. WE'LL START WITH THE DOCTORS KNOW COCA. THANK YOU OF MY NAME IS LEASE NEWARK. I AM A PAIN PHYSICIAN IN PRIVATE PRACTICE -- YOU'RE IN SACRAMENTO DO PAIN MEDICINE. MANAGEMENT ADDICTION TREATMENT -- ALSO PRIVILEGE TO SERVE AS THE SPEAKER FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. HOWEVER TODAY I AM HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. COMPOSED OVER SIX HUNDRED CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS AND ASSOCIATED PROFESSIONALS. IN THE FIELD OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. ONE OF SEE SAM'S GOALS IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WHO PRESCRIBING MANAGE BUPRENORPHINE TO TREAT OPIOID ADDICTION. SUCH PROVIDERS MISS FIRST OBTAIN A FEDERAL WAIVER INCOMPLETE EIGHT HOURS OF ONLINE TRAINING. WHILE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA OBTAINING A FEDERAL WAIVER HAS INCREASED. IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF PROVIDERS REMAIN A BARRIER TO ACCESS FOR THIS LIFESAVING MEDICATION. ADDITION TREATMENT IS NOT. TRADITIONALLY BEEN PART OF PRIMARY CARE. HOWEVER IT IS ESSENTIAL. THAT MANAGEMENT OF ADDICTIVE DISORDERS BECOME PART OF PRIMARY CARE. AS A PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEE SAM HAS BEEN PROVIDING TRAINING AND MENTORING TO PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS. IN THE M. A. T. EXPANSION PROJECT. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT OR MATT. IS A PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR OPIOID USE DISORDERS. WE SIMPLY NEED MORE PHYSICIANS PROVIDING THIS TREATMENT. THROUGH THIS PROJECT SEE SAM IS REACHING PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THE NEED IS GREAT. SELECTING A PROVIDER IN EACH CLINIC TO BECOME A CHAMPION ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO TREAT OPIOID DEPENDENT PATIENTS. AND A NORMALIZES TREATMENT AND TRAIN MORE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. WE ARE WORKING TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO PRESCRIBING DEPEND ARCANE. TO REDUCE THE FEAR THE COMES WITH EXTRA D. E. A. OVERSIGHT. TO ADDRESS THE BARRIERS FOR DRUG TESTING. AND TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF PHARMACY AS A PARTNER. HELP WITH THE ACCESS. HELP WITH ACCESS TO LOCAL ADDICTION MEDICINE RESOURCES. AND TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS ALL TOO OFTEN REQUIRED BY INSURANCE CARRIERS. UNDER THE MA T. EXPANSION PROJECT. CCM RECEIVED FUNDING TO SUPPORT FORTY EIGHT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS THROUGH MENTORED LEARNING EXPERIENCE SCHOLARSHIPS. THAT PROVIDED. TUITION TO ATTEND THE C. SAM ADDICTION MEDICINE STATE OF THE ART CONFERENCE VERY WELL ATTENDED AND AN OUTSTANDING CONFERENCE. DURING THIS THREE DAY CONFERENCE THEY LEARN MORE ABOUT MATC MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING DRUGS OF ABUSE OPIOID DEPENDENCE PAIN AND ADDICTION. THE ENVIRONMENT OF ADDICTION INCLUDING CO OCCURRING DISORDERS POLY SUB DISAPPEARS AND HOW TO REDUCE THE BARRIERS FOR PATIENTS TO GAIN ACCESS TO TREATMENT. BASED ON THEIR FEEDBACK THE OBJECTIONS OF THIS PROJECT ARE BEING ACCOMPLISHED. SHE SAM IS RECEIVING FUNDING FROM DH CS TO CONTINUE THIS PROJECT FOR TWO MORE YEARS. MENTORED LEARNING EXPERIENCE CALLER SHIPS WILL BE OFFERED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SHE SAM WILL CONTINUE THIS MISSION TO RICH OWN PROGRAM OF OFFERING MENTORING AND SCHOLARSHIPS. HOWEVER SSTAINED FUNDING IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND THE EXPAND THIS AFFECTED PROGRAM. WE ARE CONTINUE TO BE IN THE THROES OF AN OPIOID IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE EPIDEMIC. WE KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WE ASK FOR FUNDING RESOURCES TO HELP FIGHT THE SCOURGE. THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE PANEL. MUCH SECTORS THE CUT BACK TO CALI WELCOME. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS IN THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THE ASSOCIATION HERE TODAY I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AND WANTED TO ORGANIZE MY COMMENTS AROUND. THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND SPOKE SYSTEM GRANT AND I THINK THAT WE AS AN ASSOCIATION REALLY SEE BOTH OF THESE BUT PARTICULARLY THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM. AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND TO ORGANIZE AN ADVANCE -- AND INTEGRATE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT INTO THE BROADER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE'D LIKE TO SEE THIS IMPLEMENTED IN AS MANY COUNTIES AS POSSIBLE THOSE YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHER FOLKS WHO HAVE. TESTIFIED TODAY AND EXPERTS THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES INVOLVED IN THAT THAT INVOLVED -- AND INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK -- FIRST OF ALL ALL FOCUS. WITHIN THAT REALM ON NETWORK ADEQUACY AND CERTAINLY WE SEE AMONG THE COUNTIES A GROWTH IN ALL LEVELS OF CARE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT PARTICULARLY WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT AND RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT BEDS AS A NEED. CERTAINLY AS AS BUILT -- FACILITIES EITHER EXPANDING -- RENOVATING OR BUILDING NEW FACILITIES REQUIRES INVESTMENT IN THAT SOMETHING WE WOULD ENCOURAGE PERHAPS THROUGH SOME SORT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENTS EFFORTS IN THE AREA OF STREAMLINING DRUG MEDICAL CERTIFICATION SO WE CAN RECRUIT NEW PROVIDERS IN TO OUR NETWORKS. WE ALSO -- WE ALSO OF OF THE IN TERMS OF THE STIGMA USE TREATMENT TO MAKE AS THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES NOT -- NOT FACILITIES THAT PROVOKE UP POSITION. IN ADDITION YOU'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE WORK FORCE. I THINK ONE OF THE TREMENDOUS STRENGTHENED LEGACIES OF SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT PROVIDERS IS THAT WE RELY ON A GREAT DEAL OF OF PEER EXPERIENCE LIVED EXPERIENCE. THAT IS IN MANY CASES AND COUNSELING AND GROUP SESSIONS VERY VALUABLE. AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE STRUGGLE TO RECRUIT ENOUGH OF THOSE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE CLINICIANS EITHER REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED -- COUNSELORS BUT ALSO LICENSED PROFESSIONALS THAT WE ALSO NEED TO DO THE PRESCRIBING WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT AND TO DETERMINE MEDICAL NECESSITY. EITHER IF THEY'RE LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER OR A LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST -- IN ADDITION TO THAT THE WORK FORCE OFTEN STRUGGLES WITH DOCUMENTATION WHICH IS JUST A REQUIREMENT OF NOT ONLY MEDI CAL BUT MODERN HEALTH CARE. AND WE SO WE STRUGGLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRAINING OUR OUR CLINICIANS TO TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS THAT ARE REQUIREMENT. OF F OUR SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE THAT WE NEED TO SERVE AND THE LANGUAGES THAT THEY SPEAK BUT ALSO WITH CULTURAL SPECIFICITY WE SPOKE ABOUT THAT SOME ALREADY TODAY -- AND SO REFLECTING OR HAVING A A WORKFORCE THAT REFLECTS THAT NEEDED THAT SERVES THE COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSTANDS THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE MUST -- WORK IN -- IS VERY IMPORTANT AND AND SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON YOU'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ALSO ABOUT THE YOUTH SYSTEM OF CARE -- AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK TO TOO MANY COUNTIES TO HIGHLIGHT THAT -- ALL OF THE ISSUES I MENTIONED SO FAR WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO WORK FORCE THERE EVEN MORE EXTREME IN THE YOUTH -- AND THE YOU SYSTEMS OF CARE TO RECRUIT PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE THE THE ABILITY TO DELIVER DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES. AND IN MOST SETTINGS THAT WOULD REQUIRE NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL TO SERVE SOMEONE -- WITH THE THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND TRAINING TO TO SERVE AT RISK YOUTH. I THINK IN ADDITION YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT BENEFIT THAT IS A MANDATE UNDER MEDICAID AND THE pMEDICARE PROGRAM. WE IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTATE HOW IMPORTANT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ODS IS TO REALIZING THAT. THEY'RE ALL THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX THIS WAIVER PILOT TO MAKE THAT REAL AND AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN I THINK TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL COUNTIES HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU GET THE THE BENEFITS THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AN ENTITLED TO ONE OF THE PROGRAM. AND ALSO WITH AS I SAID THE THE DEVELOPMENTAL SPECIFICITY OF THE DATE THAT THEY NEED -- I THINK IN ADDITION. ONE OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT WE AS AN ASSOCIATION ARE FOCUSED ON IS THE WAY FOR RENEWAL IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAIVERS COMING UP FOR FOR RENEWAL -- NEXT YEAR AND I THINK THERE ARE THREE BROAD GOALS THAT WE WOULD EMPHASIZE IN THAT AND ARE ANXIOUS TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON DEVELOPING -- THE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OF A RENEWAL WAIVER I THINK ONE IS TO INTEGRATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES BOTH MENTAL HEALTH PLAN SERVICES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. AND ALSO TO INTEGRATE THOSE SERVICES WITH THE BROADER MEDI CAL AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. SO -- WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK VERY EXPLICITLY TO THOSE GOALS AND THE RENEWAL OF THE WAIVER I THINK THE THIRD THING THAT ALSO IS VERY IMPORTANT AND A PRIORITY OF THE ASSOCIATION AND OF OF COUNTIES. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE A FRAMEWORK THAT WORKS NOT ONLY IN LOS ANGELES OR SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUT ALSO HUMBLED. MONO SIERRA LAKE OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE ARE RURAL AND HAVE VERY DIFFERENT -- NEEDS AND PROFILES OF PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE -- THAT'S I THINK AN IMPORTANT FEATURE THAT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT. I'LL ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE TO NINETY DAY STAYS I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD ADVOCATE EITHER FOR A CAP ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN A YEAR THAT YOU CAN STAY IN RESIDENTIAL. THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO SHORTEN PERHAPS THE AUTHORIZATION PERIODS WITHOUT A CAP A STRICT CAPS IN A SHORTER AUTHORIZATION PERIOD WOULD ENSURE THAT THERE'S ONGOING MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR THAT HIGHER MORE EXPENSIVE LEVEL OF CARE. WITHOUT AGAIN DISTRICT CAP AND WE THINK THAT'S A A SOLID MOVE TOWARD PARITY WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND AND OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- I'LL WRAP UP MY COMMENTS ON THE HUB AND SPOKE SYSTEM WE THINK THIS IS BEEN A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY -- I'LL SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY EXPERIENCE WE HAVE TWO LARGE SKILLED PROVIDERS THAT ARE SERVING AS HUBS RECRUITING SPOKES BOTH IN THE PRIMARY CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH -- NETWORKS IN OUR COUNTY WE THINK THAT THEY'RE STEADILY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PRESCRIBERS AND CLINICS THAT OFFER THAT SERVICE. AGAIN OUR OUR CONCERN AS YOU HEARD BEFORE SUSTAINABILITY WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO RECRUIT PROVIDERS TO EITHER BECOME OPA TREATMENT PROGRAMS WITH DNC CERTIFICATION OR BECOME. A A AN S. U. D. TREATMENT PROVIDER WITH THE MC CERTIFICATION AT THE OUTPATIENT LEVEL AND THEN LEVERAGE THE THE OTHER MEDI CAL BENEFITS TO PROVIDE THE MEDICATIONS. SO WITH THAT I'LL OF FINISHING JUST SAY THIS IS A AN INCREDIBLE GENERATION OPPORTUNITY THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL TO SUPPORT AND MAXIMIZE. THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR KENTON. GREAT SO GOOD MORNING JENNIFER CAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT THE WAIVER AND THE WEAVER WAS. IMPLEMENTED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND IMMEDIATELY -- THAN JUST RENEWED WHEN WE WERE NEW THE WAIVER IN DECEMBER AND SOMETIMES. OUT OF GREAT CHALLENGES COME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT IS EXACTLY HOW THE ODIOUS WE'VE ACTUALLY CAME TO BE IS THAT WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM INTEGRITY ISSUE IN THE DRUG MEDICAL PROGRAM WITH. FRAUDULENT PROVIDERS AND BECAUSE OF THAT. WE SAT AMONGST OURSELVES IN THIS WAS ACTUALLY PRIOR TO ME. BEING AT THE DEPARTMENT BUT MERRILEES CAN CERTAINLY CHIME IN HERE -- WE SAT AROUND AND SAID WHAT CAN WE DO. TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM BUT ALSO YOU KNOW RETURN SOME OF THE PROGRAM INTEGRITY TO THIS AND SO THE WAIVER THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD ON IS THIS FIRST IN THE NATION. SO WE'RE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE WE ARE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT THESE BENEFITS. ARE AVAILABLE TO MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS -- IN A MEANINGFUL WAY ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF NEED. AND SO I THINK THAT -- WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM US IS NOT JUST FIVE YEAR DEMONSTRATION BASIS BUT ALWAYS WANTING -- TO HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFITS THAT COME FROM THIS AS WELL AS OUR CONTINUED INTEREST IN HAVING THIS RENEWED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- WHEN THE WAIVER EXPIRES IN DECEMBER OF -- TWENTY TWENTY I THINK THAT YOU KNOW TWO OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE ARE MOST PROUD OF ARE HERE -- AND YOU HEARD FROM THEM ALREADY -- RIVERSIDE IN LA HAVE DONE AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB IN NOT ONLY IMPLEMENTING BUT REALLY EMBRACE SCENE AND LEANING AND TO THE TO THE WORK THAT -- IS REQUIRED TO BUILD UP THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND CERTAINLY ALL OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY ACKNOWLEDGE ARE ALL CERTAINLY TRUE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN MOST -- PROUD TO SEE THE RESPONSE -- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE RIVERSIDE CALL VOLUME I THINK WE WERE CERTAINLY TAKEN ABACK -- WHEN WE SAW AND WE FELT REALLY SORRY FOR THEM BECAUSE THAT WAS THEIR CALL VOLUME AND NOT OURS -- BUT I THINK IT HAS ALSO BEEN A REALLY GREAT AND POSITIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- BUT BECAUSE WE WERE THE FIRST -- IN THE NATION WE WERE PROCESS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I'M SAYING THAT WITH SOME WHAT OF A NICE WAY BUT IT WAS A EXERCISE WILL PROCESS -- TO GET THE CONTRACTS APPROVED THEY HAD TO GO NOT ONLY THROUGH US AND GO THROUGH THE COUNTIES AND BE APPROVED BY THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS BUT THEN THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO SEE EN MASSE AFTER ALL OF THAT FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL -- SO AGAIN WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RIGHT WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS SUCCESSFUL YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN MAKING THAT HAPPEN -- I WOULD ALSO BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH OUTSIDE -- INTO T. SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION THEY HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONAL PARTNERS AND HELPING US DO THE THINGS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO WITH THE COUNTIES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE TRAINING. TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND LEARNING COLLABORATIVE AND SO -- THIS HAS NOT BEEN IN AN ISOLATED -- VACUUM IN TERMS OF THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES JUST OFF DOING THEIR OWN THING IT HAS BEEN PROVIDERS AS YOU HAVE HEARD IT HAS BEEN COUNTIES IT HAS BEEN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION -- IN YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTIONS AROUND PREVALENCE -- I WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A CH C. F. REPORT THAT WAS ACTUALLY ISSUED LAST FALL AROUND SUBSTANCE USE PROBABLY REDDING CALIFORNIA AROUND PREVALENCE STATISTICS. I THINK WHAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT -- BECAUSE I THINK WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT BUT IT'S IT GETS LOST IN THE YOU KNOW CURRENT -- OPIOID DISCUSSIONS IS THAT. THE SUBSTANCE THAT IS MOST ABUSE IN ALL POPULATIONS AND SO YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN WE TRY VERY HARD TO BUILD CAPACITY THAT IS NOT -- SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM OUR LEASE LATER ON IS THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE SO ARE AND THE S. T. R. GRANT FUNDS -- ARE OBVIOUSLY HAVING TO BE FOCUSED ON OPIATES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE FEDERAL GRANT REQUIRES IT IS ALSO OUR INTENTION IN DOING THIS THAT WE ARE BUILDING CAPACITY. FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES PROBABLY READ -- THE ONLY OTHER THING -- THAT I WOULD WILL US LEAVE YOU WITH IS NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN -- POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STATE'S WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SO THE ENHANCE MATCH AROUND THE MEDICAID EXPANSION POPULATION FOR SINGLE CHILDLESS ADULTS THE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE BEEN FACING DOWN AND IT WILL BE PERMANENTLY DOWN TO A NINETY TEN MATCH -- MAKES THIS POSSIBLE FOR THE COUNTIES THE STATE PAYS FOR THAT WHAT IS THE YOU KNOW 8% NOW OUR WHATEVER FEES THAT WERE IN THE COUNTIES AREN'T PAYING FOR ANY OF THE OTIONAL EXPANSION NOR ARE THEY PAYING FOR THE RESIDENTIAL. PORTION OF THE BENEFIT BECAUSE THOSE COMPOST REALIGNMENT SO AGAIN WE AS A STATE HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE COUNTIES TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL -- YOU KNOW ONGOING SERVICE DELIVERY MECHANISM AND SO WE AS A STATE HAVE BEEN OBVIOUSLY COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY TO MAKE THAT -- A REALITY AND THEN LASTLY I THINK -- TO YOUR COMMENT DOCTOR WOULD NOT INDICATED THAT THEY WANT TO BE A PART OF THE WAIVER I'M IT IS VOLUNTARY NATURE -- SO WE WE CAN'T FORCE THE COUNTY TO PARTICIPATE ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THINK WE HAVE ALSO AS A DEPARTMENT REACHED OUT -- TO LIKE THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM BOARD I WENT IN THE FALL AND DID APRESENTATION TO THEM TO SAVE YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO HOW YOU HAVE OPERATED THE COUNTIES. SEVENTY NOT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND OBLIGATIONS AS IT PERTAINS TO HEALTH SERVICES FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT MEDICALLY. I MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO THINK IN A WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO OPERATE THE DRUG MEDI CAL BENEFIT EITHER STATE PLAN OR WAIVER IDEALLY WAIVER OBVIOUSLY BUT STATE PLAN TO HELP THOSE COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE COMPLIANCE INFRASTRUCTURE -- TO EVEN MEET THEIR CURRENT -- OBLIGATIONS RIGHT ALPINE STRUGGLES -- SOME OF THOSE OTHERS COUNTY STRUGGLE AND HAVING -- A SINGLE ENTITY THAT IS FAMILIAR TO THE COUNTIES TO HELP ADMINISTER THAT BENEFIT WE THINK WOULD BE A REALLY POSITIVE. STEP FORWARD FOR HELPING THEM NOT ONLY COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATE REQUIREMENTS AROUND PROVISION OF SERVICES BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT RESIDENTS IN THOSE COUNTIES ACTUALLY ARE RECEIVING SOMETHING AND SO. YOU KNOW. CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH THEM BUT I WILL -- I WILL CERTAINLY DIFFER TO MARLEY SO LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE DETAILS AROUND THE HUB AND SPOKE AND OTHER. AS HERE AND SO ARE GRANT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH I THINK DOCTOR PANAS HEARD ME SPEAK BEFORE JUST KP THAT SHORT TIME. SO -- I DO WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO OUR HANDOUT THAT WE PROVIDED ADJUSTED THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PROJECTS TODAY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN MENTIONED BUT ON THE LAST PAGE IS A LIST OF ABOUT THIRTY PROJECTS THAT. THE DEPARTMENT IS OVERSEEING WITH OUR FEDERAL OP AWAY DOLLARS AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW THAT HAVE COME UP TODAY SO YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF EFFORTS. AROUND SPECIAL POPULATIONS AND AND OTHER SPECIFIC AREAS I'M SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE TODAY THINKING THAT THERE ISN'T WORK% BEING DONE -- SO I'M GOING TO QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT OUR TRIBAL ENMITY PROJECTS I KNOW THAT HAS COME UP QUITE A BIT TODAY -- SO WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE IN WORKING NOT ONLY WITH THE TRIBES TO THE URBAN AND THROUGH TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WITH OUR WAIVER AS WE'RE STILL WORKING ON REALLY DESIGNING WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THAT POPULATION. BUT ALSO AROUND OPIOIDS SO WE HAVE QUITE A FEW PROJECTS I WORKED WITH OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITY I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT QUICKLY I'M WITH SOME M. A. T. CHAMPIONS THAT GO OUT IN ON TO TRIBAL RESERVATIONS BUT ALSO WITH THE URBAN CLINICS. ARE WE HAVE A NATIVE PROJECT ECHO WHICH IS A GREAT WAY TO TEACH DOCTORS AND PHYSICIANS ABOUT PRESCRIBING VIEW BUT WE WANTED IT TO BE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE SO IT'S BEING DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY. FOR THE SO HOW ARE FUNDING SOME LOCAL OPIOID COALITIONS WHERE OUR TRIBES URBAN CLINICS CAN BE A PART OF THE COUNTY. I COALITION ORSTART THEIR OWN AND THEY ACTUALLY KICKING OFF THEIR FIRST NATIVE COALITION THAT STATEWIDE -- THAT'S COMING UP NEXT MONTH THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT -- WERE ALSO DOING SOME VERY SPECIFIC WORK BECAUSE DOCTORS TALK WELL TO DOCTORS NURSES TALK WILDER NURSES AND WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL NURSE KATIE BELL THAT GOES OUT. TO TRIBAL CLINICS AND ACTUALLY HELP THEM SET UP AN EIGHTY PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE SOME UP IN HUMBLE INYO AND SOME OF OUR OTHER. AREAS SO THAT'S BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL AS WELL I'M SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK AND WITH OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND THERE'S A TON MORE PROJECTS LIKE IT'S SPEAK ABOUT WITH THEM BUT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE SPECIFIC WORK IS BEING DONE WITH THEM. NUMBER ALSO WITH THIS GRANT FUNDING WHAT'S REALLY GREAT ABOUT IT IS WE'RE ABLE TO TAKE OUR WORK WITH OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM AND GO BEYOND THAT -- SO THESE FUNDS CAN REACH INTO JAILS SO WE HAVE A JAIL PROJECT BECAUSE OUR FOLKS MOVE IN AND OUT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SOMETIMES I'M SO WE'RE HELPING JAILS WE HAVE TWENTY THREE COUNTIES RIGHT NOW AND ANOTHER. COHORT THAT STARTING WITH THE JAIL PROJECT UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF OUR JAILS DO NOT PROVIDE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT THE REALLY HELPING THEM OVERCOME THEIR BARRIERS -- THEY ARE LEARNING TRAINING THEY'RE LEARNING FROM OTHER JAILS BUT THEY'RE ALSO RECEIVING SOME FUNDING TO ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN TO AT LEAST START. ABOUT PROCESS WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH OUR HOSPITALS WE HAVE A REALLY GREAT PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA BRIDGE THAT'S ACTUALLY RECEIVING NATIONAL ATTENTION WHERE IT'S REALLY HELPING EDIE AND HOSPITAL SETTINGS ONCE AGAIN. WHEN SOMEONE COMES INTO THOSE SETTINGS NOT JUST LET HIM LEAVE LINKING THEM INTO THE COMMUNITY IN YOUR HEARD? SPEAK ABOUT THAT EARLIER WITH OUR HUB AND SPOKE SYSTEM SO WERE ALSO -- WANT TO TOUCH ON REALLY QUICK -- TO WERE JUST KICKING OFF A RESIDENCY PROGRAM BECAUSE WHAT WE HEAR TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF OUR PHYSICIANS LEAVE THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND MAYBE A FOUR HOURS OF TRAINING WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AND NUMBER EXPECTING THEM TO YOU KNOW STAND UP AND AND GET A WAIVER EIGHT OUR WAIVER TRAINING SO MAYBE THEY'VE HAD A TOTAL OF TWELVE HOURS OF TRAINING -- SO WE DON'T FEEL THAT THAT'S ACCEPTABLE AND SO WE'RE REALLY WORKING I'M GOING TO BE WORKING WITH SOME RESIDENCY PROGRAMS TO HELP. UP THOSE HOURS AROUND SUBSTANCE USE TO REALLY TRAIN OUR WORKFORCE BETTER -- AND THEN THERE'S A TON OF MENTORING PROJECTS TALKED ABOUT THE C. SAM PROJECT -- BUT WHAT WE'VE HEARD TIME AND TIME FROM POSITIONS WHY THEY'RE NOT PRESCRIBING. THEY DON'T HAVE THE TRAINING AND THEY'RE THEY'RE SCARED THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO AN INDUCTION THEY DON'T HOW TO WORK WITH THE PATIENT. SO REALLY WORKING ON MULTIPLE LEVELS -- OF DIFFERENT MENTORING PROGRAMS -- AND WITH THAT I'M JUST GOING TO WRAP UP. AND GET THE I.. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO THAT START WITH -- CHAIR WAS YOU SEE AND IT HAS TO STEP OF OUT BRIEFLY A LITTLE THE SHORTLY [inaudible] WELL THANK. QUESTION FOR YOU -- SOME OF THE MANPOWER SHORTAGES IN ISSUES WERE TALKING ABOUT TRAINING -- I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT IT'S I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE GONNA GUESS THAT IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR TREATING YOUTH THE YOUTH. OF WILL IT IS BUT YOU KNOW KEEP KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE SPECIALLY REJECTION MEDICINE IS RELATIVELY NEW SPECIALTY -- WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME. AND I'D I DIDN'T START OUT IN ADDICTION MEDICINE NICER AND INTERNAL MEDICINE ANESTHESIA DID PAIN MEDICINE WHICH DIDN'T HAVE A RESIDENCY TO SPEAK OF EITHER. AND THEN RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A SKILL SET AN ADDICTION MEDICINE. BECAUSE OF THOSE COMORBID CONDITIONS -- THAT OVERLAP O TO TO A HIGH DEGREE -- CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT SERVER AVAILABLE TO US AT THE TIME. AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT I WON OFTEN GOT MEDICAL REVIEW OFFICER TRAINING AND TRY TO GET UP ON UP TO SPEED ON ON BIOLOGICAL FLUID ANALYSIS BECAUSE IT'S STILL AN EVOLVING ART. AND WHEN YOU START DOING THAT POINT OF SERVICE -- DRUG TESTING YOU FIND OUT THERE'S ALL KINDS OF STUFF GOING ON THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH ON A ROUTINE HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION. SO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN AND THEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MANAGEMENT BECOMES GREATER. WHO IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS JUST PRESCRIBING A MEDICATION? AND I THINK THE THE INFORMATIONAL PACKET TO THE ALL PROVIDED TO THE TION OF THE H. SAM MULTI TIERED A CONTINUUM OF CARE IS CRITICAL. IS VERY IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE IT -- SUBS USES ORDERS A BRAIN DISEASE AND LIKE ANY ANY DISEASE IT REQUIRES MONITORING MANAGEMENT CARE OVER THE OVER THE LIFE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL TO COLLECTED WHATEVER DISEASE ENTITY THAT MAY BE. IT REQUIRE THAT SKILL SET. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. A INTERESTED IN AS TO THE WILL HAVE TO LEARN OUTSIDE OF THE STANDARD CURRICULUM MINUTES AT THE VERY LEAST YOU WANNA RAISE IT AS AN ISSUE WE ARE WHY YOUR TRAINING IN IN ANY IN ANY SPECIALTY. IT DOESN'T MATTER -- WHETHER IT'S JANICE'S INTERNAL MEDICINE FAMILY PRACTICE PEDIATRICS IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT IS A LIFE LONG -- DISEASE THAT AFFECTS PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ENTER A SKILL SET. AND I THINK SEIZE HIM IT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE AT DEVELOPING EVIDENCE BASED -- INFORMATION TO HELP -- IT WORK WITH OUR COALITION PARTNERS AND EVERYBODY INVOLVED WITH THIS PROCESS. TO TO MOVE THE BALL AND SPOKE IS A BRILLIANT IT'S REALLY GREAT THE HUBS ARE -- LIKE FEDERALLY LICENSED IN A MOST OF US AFTER PRACTICE LAN ORANGE IN A FEDERALLY LICENSED FACILITY. WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE THAT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IN ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE CAN REFER TO HE'S A REALLY REQUIRES A NETWORK IT DOES REQUIRE VILLAGE IN THIS IN THIS. WE WERE WE REQUIRE IT AND NETWORK OF FOLKS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH. TO MANAGE THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS ISSUE THANK YOU -- DIRECTOR CAN -- DO YOU JUST THE ACS ENVISION THIS THESE SERVICES. BEING A CARVED OUT ALWAYS BEING CARVED OUT OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT. WELL I THINK -- BASED ON THE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT -- THAT WAS DONE OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE VOTERS -- THERE ARE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES -- THAT. WOULD HAVE TO BE. AS DISCUSSED -- IN TERMS OF TAKING. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE CARVE OUT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE BUT OBVIOUSLY SUBSTANCE USE IS ALSO CARVED OUT TO THE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND I KNOW THAT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST AND INTEGRATING AND AND TAKING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND PUTTING THEM IN WITH -- LARGER KIND OF PHYSICAL HEALTH PROGRAM -- THE FUNDING IS A COMPLICATING FACTOR FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT THERE HAD THERE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL -- THE VERSION OF FUNDING TO THE COUNTIES FOR THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH IS WHY THE ODS WAIVERS VOLUNTARY -- SUCH THAT THE COUNTIES CAN OFTEN I'M AND THEN THEY'RE USING THEIR REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AND OTHER FUN SOURCES -- TO DRIVE DOWN THE FEDERAL SHARE IN ADDITION TO OBVIOUSLY BLENDING IT WITH. STATE GENERAL FUND FOR BENEFITS THAT ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY SO I THINK. THE WAY I APPROACH IT IS -- THE PATIENT SHOULDN'T SEE THEMSELVES HATED AND THEY SHOULDN'T SEE THEMSELVES AS BEING IN A CARVE OUT BENEFIT AND IT'S REALLY UP TO US AS A STATE AND COUNTIES AND MANAGED CARE PLANS AND PROVIDERS. TO FIGURE OUT THE BACK AND INTEGRATION ISSUES AND NOT MAKE THE BENEFICIARY BE RIVER -- COGNIZANT OF THAT -- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AROUND REALIGNMENT AND SOME OF THE OTHER YOU KNOW KIND OF HISTORICAL -- WAYS THAT WE HAVE HANDLED THE DIVISION OF SERVICES BETWEEN STATE AND COUNTIES [inaudible] SO -- RECOGNIZE A PARTNERSHIP IS IS TRYING TO ADMINISTER THE ODS BENEFIT AND SEVERAL COUNTIES HOW'S THAT GOING AND HOW DO YOU SEE THAT GOING FORWARD. SO OBVIOUSLY REPRESENTS THEY THEY WORK WITH SMALL SOME OF THE SMALL COUNTIES WHERE WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THE TRACKS SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES SO HOW DO YOU SEE THIS GOING FORWARD SO I PARTNERSHIP IS BEEN WORKING WITH. EIGHT COUNTIES OF THEIR FOURTEEN COUNTIES IN THEIR SERVICE AREA -- IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING I THINK WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND THEY HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME -- TRYING TO WORK THROUGH RATE ISSUES SO THAT HAS BEEN THE REAL -- CHALLENGE BECAUSE EACH COUNTY HAS TO FUNDS. THE OF THE PART OF THE RATE THAT GOES TO PARTNERSHIP AND HOW DO THEY SET THAT RAY AND THEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RATE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE BEFORE IT GOES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR REVIEW. AND THERE HAS JUST BEEN A LOT A LOT OF COMPLEXITY AROUND THAT. FUND SOURCE AND WHO'S PAYING FOR WHAT AND AND IS IT IN THE RATE AND HOW DID YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN A WORK IN PROGRESS -- I THINK THAT WE HAVE MADE SOME GOOD -- HEADWAY -- FROM THE LAST I HEARD WE THINK WE MAY GO WITH THEM -- I THINK THAT THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS THE ONE THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER CMS P. WOULD ALSO IN CAPSULE LATE THOSE COUNTIES IF THE FOR WHATEVER REASON THE PARTNERSHIP -- PROCESS DOESN'T PLAY OUT PLUS THE CMS P. HAS A BROADER NETWORK OF COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT IN CAP SLATED IN THAT PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENT BUT I THINK WE'RE TRYING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. TO EITHER PUSH FOR REGIONAL APPROACHES OR TO PUSH FOR A MORE INTEGRATED WEIGH EVEN -- AS YOU KNOW AS I SAID TRYING TO DO THE BACKEND INTEGRATION WITH EACH OTHER RATHER THAN MAKING THE BENEFICIARY BE PART OF A BIFURCATED SYSTEM. GOOD SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE FUNDING RUNS OUT [inaudible] WHO? I HAD A ONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION OKAY. I PREFER TO LIVE IN THE REALITY THAT WE HAVE TODAY WHICH IS WE HAVE FEDERAL FUNDS WE HAVE STATE FUNDS WE HAVE LOTS OF RESOURCES AND WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT CHANGES IN ANY WAY -- I WILL. DEFER TO YOUR WISDOM OKAY. I I WOULD. I WILL ASK ONE REALLY REFRESHING YOU MENTIONED A LOT OF COLLABORATION CHS HAVE. YOU DIDN'T MENTION THE PH SO WAS THAT WAS AT ASSUME THERE'S CORPORATION WITH PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY NO I WAS TALKING JUST AS IT PERTAINS TO LIKE ODS WAIVER. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF WORK ACROSS THE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF OTHERS AS IT PERTAINS TO THE OPIOID COALITION WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PH ON SOME OF THE USE OF THE S. T. R. AND SO ARE GRANTS. THAT HELP THEM DO SURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING -- I THINK WE'RE VERY PROUD AND WE USE IT -- A LOT IN TERMS OF THE DASHBOARD THAT THEY HAVE CREATED IN TERMS OF ALL OF THOSE -- REALLY HELPFUL WAYS FOR HOW WE SO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE LEASES DONE IN TERMS OF THE VERY TARGETED PROJECTS. HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE DATA THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS PUT UP ON THEIR OPA DASHBOARD TO SAY WHERE ARE HIGHEST. RISK COUNTIES AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW THERE UP IN THE UPPER NORTH BUT I THINK A LOT OF WORK IS GONE IN WITH THEM. AROUND -- ACADEMIC DETAILING AND THERE'S SOME OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH THEM ON AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AROUND. PROP SIXTY FOUR AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE COLLABORATION THAT IS BEING BUILT THERE AS WELL. AND I MENTIONED THAT -- THE P. H. WAS THERE BECOMING UP LATER -- AS WELL SO LOOKING FORTY HEARING FROM THEM ALSO APPRECIATE -- BUT BOTH SWISS AND DISCOUNT THE PREVIOUS PANEL THAT ALTHOUGH OUR FOCUS IS OFTEN OPIOIDS IT REALLY IS ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE. TREATMENT RIGHT -- ITSELF. OKAY CERTAINLY ONE BUT WE'VE ALSO HERE DOES A SHIFT FROM OPIOIDS TOWARD. THAT AS WERE CLAMPING DOWN OPIOIDS TOWARD MATH AND SEPTEMBER. MCCARTY. I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON DOCTOR WOULD QUESTION ABOUT FUNDING BUT I JUST WANTED TO ASK ABOUT YOU AND THE AND THAT THE WORK FORCE AND THEN THE PROVIDERS I KNOW WE HAVE A GRAY CAT HE INTEREST RIGHT HERE AND AND JUST TO JUST LEFT THE ROOM SO DON'T. ALWAYS IN A POINT AT THEIR PROFESSIONALS BY -- BUT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THEN BEING ABLE. TO TO FOCUS ON THE TREATMENT SIDE THE X. WAIVERS NOT ALWAYS -- READILY AVAILABLE AND NOR TO PEOPLE IN THE PROFESSION. HAVE THAT TRICK TRAINING IF YOU ASK PEOPLE IN ON THE STREET ABOUT THIS ISSUE THOUGH FIVE SCRATCH THEIR HEAD RELATED SO EASY FOR SOMEONE TO PRESCRIBE. BY COULD IN OXYCONTIN SO FORTH BUT SO DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO PRESCRIBE. THE MEDICATION TO GET OFF OF THEIR ADDICTION SO -- HAVE WE SEEN ANY ANY CHANGE TO THAT I KNOW WE WE WORK TO LEGISLATION LAST YEAR AND SENATE HEALTH CLAIM ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE HELPS GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE TO ADDRESS THAT. SO IS THERE ANY. ANY REASON TO BE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE SEEING MORE PEOPLE IN THE WORK FORCE. READY TO STEP UP FROM THE STREET INSIDE. YEAH SO YOU BROUGHT UP SOME EXCELLENT POINTS AND JUST TO BE CLEAR FOR THOSE THAT AREN'T AWARE OF THE X. WAVERED AS A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT -- AND SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BY VARIOUS STATES QUESTIONING WHY CAN ANY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED AN OPIOID THAT'S HIGHLY ADDICTIVE BUT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SPECIALIZED TRAINING TO PROVIDE THE SOLUTION -- SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALKS ON THAT IS A FEDERAL ISSUE -- THAT BEING SAID WE'RE WORKING WITHIN THOSE PRE THE OTHER PROJECTS I HAVEN'T MENTIONED THAT WE'RE DOING SOME. LARGE MIT WORK FOR SUMMITS -- THIS SUMMER THAT ARE FREE OF CHARGE CAN GET SEE USE SOME FOLKS CAN COME IN AND LEARN ABOUT HOW TO PRESCRIBE MATC -- THE TRAINING FOR PEOPLE MORPHINE IS NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET IT ONLINE FOR FREE SO WE'RE MAKING SYSTEMS AWARE OF THAT -- WE'VE EEN DOING A LOT OF WORK WITH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS HELPING THEM INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PRESCRIBERS -- BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING AND OTHER STATES HAVE FOUND IS IT'S ONE THING TO GET AN AXE WAIVER THAT'S GREAT THAT DOESN'T THAT REALLY ISN'T A SOLUTION IT'S PART OF IT. IT'S PROVIDING THAT MENTORING AND TRAINING AROUND SO THAT FOLKS ARE FEELING COMFORTABLE -- TO PRESCRIBE SO WE HAVE TONS OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AROUND THAT EVEN I'M HAVING DOCTORS GO OUT PHYSICALLY ON SITE TO NEW PRESCRIBER AND HELPING THEM WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE DOING A BIG SURVEY OF ALL THE X. WAVERED PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA. WHY ARE YOU NOT PRESCRIBING WHAT YOUR BARRIERS WHAT DO YOU NEED HELP WITH I'M SORRY TAKING A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH -- AND PUBLIC HEALTH IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THE COLLABORATION OF VARIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS AND CALIFORNIA THAT THE WORKING TOGETHER. ON A DIFFERENT EFFORTS -- SO LET THEM I WANT TO STEAL THEIR THUNDER -- BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH BROAD DIFFERENT SECTORS OF STATE DEPARTMENTS IN THIS AREAS AS WELL OF HOW CAN WE GET MORE FOLKS -- TO STEP UP AND I DO JUST WANT TO QUICKLY RELEASE THIRTY SIX THOUSAND FOLKS INTO THE COMMUNITY EVERY YEAR I'M WORKING ON HOW TO LINK THEM TO OUR WAY. FOR BUT THEY'RE ALSO TAKING A VERY BROAD STEP FORWARD AND IF ANNOUNCED THAT -- IN THE FALL OF LAST YEAR HOW THEIR GO RE DESIGNING THEIR WHOLE STD SYSTEM BUT THEY'RE LOOKING TO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE WAIVER THEY'RE GONNA REQUIRE A STAMP BUT REALLY GETTING A COORDINATED SYSTEM OF CARE. FOR INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF PAYMENT SOURCE IF THEY HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. OKAY THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR DIRECTOR CAN'T BACK TO DOCTOR WOODS QUESTION ON THE FUNDING AND YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT EITHER. A SOURCE AND YOU KNOW STATE FUNDING IN IN THE IN THE BUDGET OF COURSE IS MORE TIGHT THIS YEAR BUT EVEN IF IT WAS LAST YEAR THERE ARE STILL SO MANY OTHER PRIORITIES THAT. THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE TO FOCUS ON AS WELL. SO SO THAT BEING SAID IN THIS. IN THIS -- IS THIS YOUR YET OUR POINT YEAH SURE YES YES IT IS THAT THERE'S THERE'S TWO POTS OF MONEY HERE ONE IS THAT THE TARGET A RESPONSE. HE SAID ONCE THE THANK THE GRANTED CELL ONCE NINETY MILLION OVER TWO YEARS AND ONCE ONE FORTY OVER TWO YEARS AND SO -- THAT THE WORK THAT WE HEARD ON THE PRIOR PANELS ESSENTIALLY IS AS PART OF THIS YES -- FUNDING STREAMS OUT IF IF THIS WENT AWAY ALL OF THAT -- POTENTIALLY WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE WORK HAT MARLEY SPOKE TO IN TERMS OF ALL THE PROJECTS AND HUB AND SPOKE AND THE NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION. THAT IS ALL BEEN FUNDED BY THOSE TWO FEDERAL GRAY BUDGET THAT WAS -- ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT WAS ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS IN THE BUDGET -- IS IN USE IT IN THE SENATE IT EXTENDS FUNDING FOR MULTIPLE YEARS IT HAS A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FOR STATES TO USE AROUND -- WOMEN WITH OPIOID DISORDER SO I THINK WE'RE STILL KIND OF UNPACKING THE THE DOCUMENT TO SOMEHOW DETAIL AND SOME DIDN'T BUT WE HAD BEEN -- ADVISE THROUGH OUR CONTACTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THEY WERE LIKELY TO EXTEND THE GRANT FUNDING -- FOR MULTIPLE YEARS AND SO THAT JUST MEANS THAT -- OUR LEASE HAS TO THINK OF MORE PROJECTS -- TO FUND IN THE STATE SO IT'S A CRITICAL RESOURCE IT WILL COME TO AN END AT SOME POINT BUT FOR NOW THERE'S MULTIPLE YEARS OF GRANT FUNDING. AND SOMETIMES WHEN STATES DON'T SPEND THEIR ALLOCATION THEY WILL GO BACK TO OTHER STATES AND SAY DO YOU WANT ANOTHER YOU KNOW DO YOU NEED US AND SO THERE'S OFTENTIMES REALLOCATION OF UNDER SPENT FUNDS AND THEN. THE FUNDING AROUND MEDICAID OBVIOUSLY IS SO CRITICAL BECAUSE IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM AND FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE PUT IN AS A STATE -- WE GET A DOLLAR FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR WHATEVER THOSE SERVICES NEED TO BEAND SO THAT'S KIND OF MORE OF MY THAT'S THE PART THAT IS MUCH HARDER TO MAKE UP OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S A FEDERAL CHANGE OF THAT KIND OF FUNDING. SO BESIDES POTENTIALLY LOSING IT RIVERSIDE. AND THE OTHER. ONE LOS ANGELES THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS. THAT THERE IS -- A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE BENEFITING BUT A LOT OF NEED OUT THERE SO IS THERE ANY -- QUANTIFIABLE INFORMATION AT THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE. IS IS NEEDED TO TO BASICALLY -- AT WRAP UP THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ALREADY YEAH SO I HAVE. I HAVE SOME OLD DATA -- THAT HASN'T BEEN UPDATED SINCE LAST TIME I PULLED IT BUT JUST FROM A MAGNIFICATION OF FUNDS -- I'LL USE RIVERSIDE LOS ANGELES OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY TESTIFIED SO BASED ON WHEN WE RAN CLAIMS AND DOLLARS -- FOR RIVERSIDE THEY PUT IN TWO POINT ONE MILLION OF THEIR OWN MONEY -- THE STATE PUT IN FOUR POINT. FIVE AND THEY DREW DOWN TWENTY SIX MILLION AND FEDERAL FUNDS AND DELIVERED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SERVICES. SO FOR TWO POINT ONE MILLION THAT RIVERSIDE PUT IN THEY GOT THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SERVICES THE MAGNIFICATION. OF THOSE DOLLARS IS WHAT HAS BEEN SO CRITICAL AND I THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY WHAT THE COUNTY IS REFERRING TO IS IS. THE CREATION OF THIS DELIVERY SYSTEM ALLOWS THEM THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME AND SAY I NEED HELP. THAT IT USED TO BE WELL I DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW I HAVE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE BLOCK GRANT AND IT'S ONLY. YOU KNOW EIGHT HER THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE AFTER THAT. THIS BASICALLY SAYS FOR EVERY PERSON THAT COMES TO THE COUNTY AND SAYS I'M A MEDICARE RECIPIENT I MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA THE COUNTY HAS A PLACE FOR THEM AND THEY HAVE A FUN SOURCE THAT GOES TO TOWARDS THAT I MEAN LOS ANGELES -- ON THE STATE AND THEY PUT IN TEN MILLION OF THEIR OWN MONEY. EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION IN STATE GENERAL FUND SIXTY MILLION AND FEDERAL FUNDS SO FOR TEN MILLION INVESTMENT BY THE COUNTY THEY GOT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE SERVICES -- AND SO THAT HAS BEEN -- THAT CANNOT BE -- UNDERSTATED IN TERMS OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HELP YOU MEET THE NEED AND AGAIN YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR AND THEY HAVE TO KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT WAS CERTAINLY PART OF THE TESTIMONY FROM THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT. PART OF THE POPULATION THAT DOESN'T FEEL THAT PUT ALL THE MECHANICS AND PLACE THAT WHEN THEY DO COME TO THAT REALIZATION EITHER THEIR FAMILY OR THEY YOU KNOW WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR THEIR REQUIRED TO HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CALL LINES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. YOU KNOW ALL YOUKNOW THE APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES AND YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES OF A MANAGED CARE PLAN THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO REALLY. UP THERE ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEAL WITH BOTH THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE RIGHT DATA AND THAT THE RIGHT NETWORK IS IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE ALL THE THE NEED WITHIN THAT WAIVER SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND FEW QUESTIONS AS WELL -- SO -- DUTCH SNUCK -- WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SO. YOU'RE DOING TRAININGS WERE FRIGHTENING MENTORSHIP -- WE STILL HAVE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE NERVOUS RIGHT NOW AND AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW WITH THE MENTORSHIP AND THE TRAINING AND MAYBE WE NEED A LOT MORE TRAINING AND ATTENDING CCM CLASSES. HOW HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS THIS -- THE FDA OVERSIGHT ME CLEARLY FDA'S FEDERAL BUT IS DEL THE FDA THE MEDICAL BOARD AND RAISES THE FIVE WITH. A PRE IN THE PREVIOUS QUESTION BUT HOW HOW BIG OF A OF AN ISSUE IS. PROVIDE -- MATT I MEAN IS IS THIS. THERE'S MORE WE NEED TO DO TO TRY TO REASSURE THEM THAT. THEY'RE DOING YOU KNOW I'LL TELL YOU AS A PROVIDER THAT THEY RECKON FORSMAN AGENCY IS ON WATER AVENUE AND I'M ON BELL STREET. AND I DID HAVING COME KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND ASKED ME SOME QUESTIONS -- BECAUSE A NET IN NEXT DESIGNATION. AS A GREAT PAIN SPECIALS ARE PREDOMINATELY PRESCRIBE. OPIATES FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT AND SO MY USE OF BUPRENORPHINE PREDOMINATELY IS FOR PAIN MEDICINE NOT SO MUCH FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT. ALTHOUGH A I AM INVOLVED WITH ADDICTION TREATMENT IN A VARIETY OF OTHER VENUES -- THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME DISEASE. BUT IN IN MINE -- PRACTICE OF PAIN MEDICINE -- THROUGH A VARIETY OF THINGS YOU SEE GUIDELINES OF WRITING THINGS -- THERE'S BEEN A MOVEMENT TO REDUCE MORPHINE EQUIVALENT OF CG AND CO PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS IS SO THE THE SUBSTITUTE DRUG DO JURY IS. AN ORPHAN. AND THE BARRIER TO ACCESS TO THAT IS THE COST -- AND ACCESSIBILITY -- AND THE OTHER THING IS TO BE OPEN OR FOR MY CALL THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ARE ARE ON THE DATABASE SNEAKERS DATABASES HOUSING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND AS YOU KNOW IS BEING -- MIND BY -- FORSMAN. AND THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S A CORNERS PROJECT IT'S ON GOING TO TO READ CORRECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF YOUR STATUS [inaudible] SO. MOST PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO BE A LITTLE ADVERSE TO RISK. AND THERE'S CERTAINLY RISK INVOLVED WITH PRESCRIBING A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE RECALL WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN. BEFORE WEHAD TRIPLICATE PRESCRIPTIONS SO FAR BACK CARGO. IN ONLY A THIRD OF THE ELIGIBLE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA EVEN EVEN HAVE THEM LET ALONE USE THEM SO IS A CONVENIENT EXCUSE NOT TO PRESCRIBE AT ALL. CHAU. IT IS AN ISSUE IN A AND I THINK VIRTUES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY A NETWORK THAT IS MORE OR LESS IN AGREEMENT WITH HOW WE MANAGE THESE PATIENTS ARE BE MORE COMFORT. WHAT YOU DON'T WANT IT WOULD WHAT HAPPENS ALL TOO OFTEN I IN OF ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF A TERTIARY CARE? PROVIDER BECAUSE I'M KIND OF THE LAST QUARTER RESORT FOR PATIENTS WITH PAIN DISORDERS. WHAT HAPPENS YOU GET VERY LONELY ISSUE IS YOUR PRACTICE DEVELOPS AND COMPLEXITY? WHICH I WHAT I LIKE THAT BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE REFERRAL SOURCES AND BE DIMINISH FOR HELP. IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WHICH ISSUED WE'RE TALKING BOUT OPIOIDS BUT AS I JUST STATED. WHEN I TO YOUR DRUG SCREENING INTO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS I FIND ALL KINDS OF A CALLED ALCOHOLISM MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE? AND I FIND A LOT OF WELL YOU KNOW CHICHI POSITIVITY BUT I ALSO FIND A LOT OF METHAMPHETAMINE. DOES NOT DOES NOT EXPECTED OWNERS OFTEN FIND HER WHEN OR FAT NO THAT TYPE STUFF BUT IT TELLS ME THAT THE THE SUBS ABUSE COMMUNITY IS MUCH BROADER THAN WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE MORE OF THIS. TO TO WAKE UP TO THAT REALITY INCORPORATE THAT INTO OUR PRACTICES. SHOW I THINK I THINK THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE WE DON'T WANT TO LIST YOUR SOME MEDICATIONS BUT WE DO WANT PEOPLE. TO HAVE -- BE ENCOURAGED TO HAVE AND THE TREATMENT FOR THOSE THAT ARE CAPABLE OF DOING SO REDUCE THE STIGMA AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ONCE WE ESTABLISH THAT THIS IS A DISEASE. AN H. B. MANAGERS SUCH A REQUIRES LONG TERM CARE AND MULTIFACETED APPROACH AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED ONE OF THE BARRIERS -- FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IS THE HOW CAN OVER FOR THIS PATIENT ON HOW CAN I I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE DRUG TREATMENT SPECIALIST BY MYSELF I WANT TO HAVE A A TEAM. THE COMMITTEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE. OF THE CALL USE THAT SWITCH HATS SINCE YOUR LEADER IN CMA SO WHAT IS THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WHAT'S CMA DOING TO TRY. TO WELL SUITED ONLY TO HELP THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY I SHOULD BE ACT WORKED DISAPPEAR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PHYSICIANS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE -- YOU KNOW WE'RE INVOLVED WITH THE ANNUAL HOUSE OF DELEGATES TO THE DISCUSSES MAJOR ISSUES. A MAJOR ISSUES HAVE INVOLVED THESE VERY TOPICS OPIOIDS -- AND THAT SORT OF THING HAVE BEEN MAJOR ISSUES CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN OF FORWARD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OP TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE. TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS AND BRACING THE CONCEPT THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. THE BEST MEDICAL MANAGEMENT IS ONE PATIENT AT A TIME INDIVIDUATED CARE FOR THAT PATIENT. THAT'S THE UNDERLYING THEME OF HOW WE APPROACH THINGS I WOULD NOTE THAT THE CDC GUIDELINES OR DIRECTED AT THAT A AND A MORE GENERAL PRIMARY WHAT WE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO BRING THIS INFORMATION FORWARD -- AND ONE OF THE REASONS I'M HERE TODAY IS IS -- MY PARTNERSHIP AS AS A LEADER IN CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WITH. A IN CALIFORNIA CITED ADDICTION MEDICINE AND THE LARGER ENTITY AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. AND ALL THE VARIOUS PLAYERS AND FALL THE PAIN MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY INTERVENTIONAL PAIN MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY. TO BRING US TOGETHER SO WE'RE KIND OF TALKING ON THE SAME PAGE AND AND NOT. KNOW THAT OLD ADAGE ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF THE ANIMAL ARE YOU YOU'RE TRYING TO DESCRIBE. IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION IS SOMEWHAT UNIFIED THEY WERE IN AGREEMENT WITH AS WE MOVE FORWARD IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GET. THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION BRINGS EVERYBODY TOGETHER UNDER ONE ROOF SO WE CAN HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS. AND THE DOCTOR CONNELLY -- THE YEAH WE'VE HEARD FROM DIRECT CAN'T ALL RIGHT THE THAT'S THE ANY SAMPLES WERE THE ONES HERE RIGHT RIVERSIDE LA YOUR LA. BUT THEN WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER COUNTY SO YOU'RE HERE ALSO REPRESENT BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION YOU'RE ON THE GOVERNING BOARD -- WE WE ALSO HEARD ABOUT -- AT LEAST FROM. NOW THIS IS THE NOW -- ABOUT -- SOME ISSUES ABOUT. WELL YOU KNOW YOU THROUGH CERTIFICATION FOR DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND SO TYPICALLY VOEPEL IS A REALLY BIG COUNTY. THE PRIDE JUST THAT CLUB THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE ON THE ROAD WE PROBABLY HAVE A NETWORK FOR YOU INVOLVE MULTIPLE COUNTIES RATE AND SO FORTH AND SO AWARE TO THINGS THAT. COUNTIES ARE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO WELL WE HEARD STANDARDIZED MEDICAL NECESSITY ACROSS COUNTIES AND THAT MAY BE A QUESTION FOR DOCTOR CAN ALSO AS WELL -- TRYING. TO THE STANDARDIZED CERTIFICATION SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY OPERATE MULTIPLE COUNTIES IS THAT HAVING. TO RECERTIFY OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR DIFFERENT COUNTIES -- AND ALSO WHAT HOW DO WE MOVE SO DO YOU HAVE THAT PIECE OF IT AND THEN ALSO WE WE HEARD RIVERSIDE SO WE ARE THE AVERAGE OF 7% ACCORDING TO EVALUATORS RIVERSIDE CLAIMED 80% INCREASE I DON'T KNOW LA WAS BUT HOW WE GET EVERYONE UP TO THAT. EIGHTY FOR THIS IS THE 7% THAT WE HAVE STATEWIDE AND WHAT CAN WE DO. TO TAKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND LA LAW DOING RIVERSIDE AND GET OTHER COUNTIES TO DO THE SAME THING SO THERE'S A LOT. OF SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OTHER -- SO I'LL SPEAK TO THEM IN ORDER I THINK WITH REGARD TO MEDICAL NECESSITY ODS REALLY DOES PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO THAT BY REQUIRING. THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE CRITERIA TO BE INCORPORATED IN THE ASSESSMENT SO THAT IS ONE ROUTE TO TAKE -- AND I THINK ONE WAY FOR COUNTIES TO REALLY STANDARDIZE THE WAY THAT THEY'RE APPROACHING A PLACEMENT ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IN A SPECIFIC LEVEL OF CARE WITH REGARD TO CERTIFICATION. FOR FACILITIES THAT ALSO WAS HANDLED AT THE STATE LEVEL THROUGH PROVIDER ENROLLMENT AT DH CS. THOUGH I THINK MISTER SIN ELLA ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS THAT. WHEN WHEN OUR CONTRACT? THE PROGRAM AUDITOR'S FROM FROM THE COUNTY GO IN AND LOOK AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT STAFF IN THOSE FACILITIES WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED TRAINING ON THE SAME CRITERIA. THEY RECEIVED ALL OF THE DIFFERENT REQUIRED -- EDUCATIONAL MODULES THAT THAT WE WOULD REQUIRE IN THE STATE WOULD REQUIRE UNDER CONTRACT. SO THAT'S I THINK THAT'S MORE WHAT -- WHAT HE SPEAKING TO WITH REGARD RIDLEY I THINK THERE COULD EVENTUALLY BE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A MORE STANDARDIZED REPOSITORY FOR THAT INFORMATION BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE INVESTMENT? SO THAT WOULD THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME INFORMATION SYSTEMS BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IT'S IN THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE I WOULD SAY -- IN ADDITION IT WITH REGARD TO THE INCREASE IN AND UTILIZATION WHAT WE SAW IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WAS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR. WE SAW A 60% INCREASE ROUGHLY AND RESIDENTIAL ADMISSIONS WHICH WAS HUGE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE HAD BEFORE. AND TO PUT A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT ON TOP OF WHAT DIRECTOR KENNETH SAID. BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL MATCHING DOLLARS AVAILABLE THROUGH MEDI CAL WHEN A LOT OF OUR TREATMENT WAS FUNDED THROUGH OTHER SOURCES LIKE AB ONE OH NINE PREVIOUSLY THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM ETCETERA. THOSE WERE STRICTLY CAP DOLLARS SO NOW THAT W HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING REALIGNMENT WE CAN APPLY TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. IT OPENS UP MANY MANY MORE BEDS -- IN OUR CONTRACTED FACILITIES SO AS LONG AS WE HAVE THOSE PROVIDERS UNDER CONTRACT WE CAN BUY EVERY SINGLE BUT IN THAT FACILITY IF WE HAVE THE RESOURCES OR NOT STRICTLY. CAPPED ANYMORE -- AS WE WERE PREVIOUSLY WITH FEDERAL BLOCK GRANT DOLLARS OR AB ONE OH NINE DOLLAR. SO THAT THAT I THINK THAT COVERS MANY OF DID THE ISSUES YOU RAISED THAT I MISS ANYTHING. BUT I IT'S GREAT TO HEAR LA COUNTY SIXTY FOR SAID I HERE WHICH IS THE BIGGEST COUNTY IN OUR STATE -- HERE NEVER SIDE -- PERCENT SO WHERE WAS THE OVERALL STATE ONLY 7% HEARD SOME OF THE FOR THE EASTER COUNTIES OF US BE LAGGING BEHIND AND SAID WE HAVE THESE. LEAD AND WE WE PLAY OUT THE 3% THAT WERE COVERED BY ODS BUT WAS A 97% OF POPULATION -- SAID BUT SO WHAT WHERE WE GO IT IS SO WHAT ARE SOME THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER COUNTIES RIGHT -- YOU KNOW EIGHTY TWO SIXTY THE HOUSE 7% AVERAGE LIKE WHAT WHAT'S HOLDING THE OTHER SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTIES BACK. I THINK I WOULD IDENTIFY THREE THINGS PRINCIPALLY NUMBER ONE IS PROBABLY. FOR A LOT OF ROLLER SMALLER COUNTIES WITH PERHAPS LESS INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S REALLY A LIMIT IN TERMS OF WHAT FACILITIES THEY HAVE. SO THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST LIMITATION THE SECOND REALLY IS WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SO THERE'S BEEN INVESTMENT IN THE PAST IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SPACE AND THAT MADE IN THAT REGARD. I THINK THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE -- IN THE SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT FIELD AS WELL WE JUST WE WE ARE SORELY LACKING THE WORK FORCE TO SERVE. ALL OF THE NEED DID LA IN RIVERSIDE HIGHER EVERYONE ELSE PEOPLE. I DON'T I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE WE STILL NEED MORE. WELL I HAVE A I GUESS THERE IS A BAND THAT AND AGREED. I'M NOT DISAGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT WE NEED TO DO WORK WORK FORCE RIGHT WITH THE WORKFORCE IS INSUFFICIENT BUT ALSO. I WOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE AND THAT. RIVERSIDE DR 80% YOU JUST TALK YOUR EXISTING WORK FORCE THE BEADED SUCK UP ALL THE WORK FORCE BUT ALL THE OTHER PEOLE THEY ALL MOVED TO THIS TO COUNTIES AND THAT'S WHY THE OTHER COUNTIES COULD DO IT RIGHT I'M SORRY. I IS I'M NOT SAYING THAT WORKFORCE IS AN ISSUE BUT I'M ALSO SAYING THAT WELL YOU SAID YOU GOT 60% INCREASE IN LA LA YOU KNOW AT SO. WHAT ELSE IS HOLDING PEOPLE BACK SO LOOK AT THAT AND SEE WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO? BUT WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING AS WELL BECAUSE AT LEAST THAT WASN'T THERE WITH THE STATE THAT MADE THAT IF MAYBE RATE LIVING STAT BUT IT DIDN'T HOLD YOU BACK FROM DOING 60% LA COUNTY. SO YEAH I THINK THE OTHER PIECE THE THAT ALSO ARE COLLEAGUES FROM DH CS SPOKE TO HAS TO DO WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE CAPABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES SO WE ARE. A LARGE COUNTY WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF EMPLOYEES WITHIN OUR DIVISION WE HAVE BROUGHT ON A LOT OF STAFF TO HANDLE AUTHORIZATIONS AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT -- MANY OF THEM ARE CLINICIANS LICENSED PROFESSIONALS SOCIAL WORKERS PHYSICIANS NURSES WHO HANDLE THAT WORK WE'VE GOT A A STRATEGIC PLANNING STAFF A MARKETING AND BENEFITS YOUR ENGAGEMENT STAFF. WHICH ARE. YOU KNOW THE WHICH ARE FUNCTIONS THAT I DON'T EXIST I DON'T THINK EXIST IN A LOT OF OTHER COUNTY SO PART OF IT REALLY IS I THINK THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTY TO SHOULDER -- AND TO TAKE ON A LOT OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF OF THE WAIVER I I WOULD SAY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD WOULD RAISE THAT IS AN IMMEDIATE LIMITATION -- THANKS THE CROWD THANK YOU YOU KNOW. MODOC COUNTY IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES IN THE STATE. THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN GET FROM ALL TERRORIST READING WHICH IS A HUB CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET TO IS SUSANVILLE. IN MOST PEOPLE IN MODOC COUNTY GET THEIR HEALTH CARE EITHER IN OREGON OR IN IN RENO. SO. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IS LEVERAGE AND EXTEND THE REACH OF THE PROVIDERS DEBTS TELEHEALTH IN A DROP OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS TO TO WHICH WE DON'T HAVE AN ABUNDANCE. YOU KNOW I I'VE WORKED FOR YEARS TO TRY TO BUILD TO DO THAT THERE'S A VARIETY OF ENCUMBRANCES WITH HIP AND THAT pSORT OF THING. BUT WE COULD EXTEND THE REACH OF THE EXISTING PROVIDERS NOW IF WE COULD JUST ADDRESS THOSE SITUATIONS. BUT I THINK CERTAINLY WILL -- YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE PEOPLE BUT I ALSO WANT THAT WE WON'T PEOPLE LOOK AT WORKFORCE ISSUES -- AND THIS IS BEYOND JUST SUBSTANCE USE BUT YOU KNOW WE WE FOR A BURDEN MANY PROVIDERS WITH ADMINISTRATIVE WORK SO FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS IS NOT THE TWO SUBS USE BUT THE RESEARCH STUDY DONE. PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS ONLY SPENDING 26% OF TIME DOING CLINICAL WORK. IF YOU WANT W. WORKFORCE CUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK DOWN THE 50%. YOU CAN STILL SPEND 50% AND YOU BASICALLY AND LET DO 50% CLINICAL ARCHITECT TO DOUBLE YOUR PRIMARY CARE WORK FORCE. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS IN THE SUBSTANCE USE AREA BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S THERE'S A COST TO THE WORK FORCE WHEN PEOPLE ARE OVER BURDENED WITH. WITH -- WITH OVER A BASICALLY OF WORK AND I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW CMS KANAREK CHOIR CERTAINLY OF DOCUMENTATION WE HAVE TO SET HER UP BUT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT THE BALANCE AND HAVE THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION NOW IN THE STATE BUT NATIONALLY AS WELL -- BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE THEN IS IS THAT -- IN TERMS OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. I MEA. I KNOW THAT EACH COUNTY HAS CERTAINLY HAS THE AS PRIDE IN ITSELF AND EVERYONE WANTS TO DO THEIR OWN THING AND WE HAVE SMALL COUNTY IS A LARGE ACCOUNT USING YOUR RIGHT YOU KNOW FIGURE COUNTIES LIKE LA. HAVE MORE SUPPORT HELP OTHER SUPPORT FOLKS YOU CAN DO IF MARKETS ADDRESS BUT I MEAN IS IS THERE SOME EFFORT TO THINK ABOUT WELL HOW CAN. WE E. REGION LIES ARE BUYING THE THE TO COLLABORATE MULTIPLE COUNTIES COMING TOGETHER TO DO SOME OF THESE FUNCTIONS -- IS THERE SOME MECHANISM TO TO DO THAT I REALIZE EVERY COUNTY HAS THEIR OWN BUDGET THEY GET THEIR OWN I MEAN I'VE HEARD BUT SUBCOMMITTEE TO GET DOWN A LITTLE. BUT YEAH THERE TO DEFUSE THE FUNDING STREAM BUT AT SOME POINT TO BUILD THAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE. RIGHT -- IT IN SUCH A SMALL ONES MAYBE THAN EVEN THE MEDIUM ONES ARE MEETING WAS CAN HELP SMALL ONES THAT WE TALK ABOUT HUB AND SPOKE. WHAT ABOUT A HUB AND SPOKE FOR COUNTIES RIGHT WHAT ABOUT PROBABLY AS WELL AS TERMS OF OUT REACH NOT COUNTY SPECIFIC WHEN MARK? BUT I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IS BECAUSE WE AGES SERVE HERE THIS I GO OKAY WELL. YOU KNOW BUT IT'S GOOD I APPRECIATE HAVING LA HERE APRIL RIVERSIDE HIGH PERFORMING ONCE WEBER THE LOW PERFORMING ONE SAKE TELL ME WHAT THE PRICE YEAH WHAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM BEING AN LA RIVER SIDE RIGHT AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO GET. TO WHERE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE TO TRY TO GET YOUR PERFORMANCE UP TO THAT -- THAT LEVEL YEAH I THINK YOUR YOUR COMMENTS A LINE VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FEELINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION AND IT REGIONAL APPROACHES I THINK FOR MANY WILL BE A WAY TO PULL RSOURCES PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES SO THAT. THAT ABSOLUTELY A LINES I THINK WITH THE GOALS OF OF THE THE ASSOCIATION AND THE VARIOUS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS AN INFRASTRUCTURE VERY DIFFERENT CROSS THE STATE AND SO. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN A FRAMEWORK THAT LOOKS AT IN CERTAIN AREAS WERE THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE PERHAPS EVEN AMONG MEDIUM SIZE COUNTIES THAT THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION THAT THEY COULD PURSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. LEVERAGING EVERYBODY'S RESOURCES IN A PARTICULAR REGION -- AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE COUNTIES TO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS IS ANOTHER QUESTION THERE THERE IS. A PROVISION IN THE DMC ODS WAIVER THAT ALLOWS OBVIOUSLY COUNTIES AS PARTNERSHIP IS DOING WITH NORTHERN RURAL COUNTIES. TO TO YOU KNOW ENGAGE IN PARTNERSHIPS AND TO WORK WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS TO USE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO OPERATIONALIZE THE BENEFIT AS WELL. SO I THINK THE THE WAYS THAT COUNTIES MAY APPROACH THEIR THEIR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO MAKE -- BENEFITS MORE ROBUST WILL VARY ACROSS THE COUNTIES BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT IDEAS AND AND THERE'S OPENNESS TO ELABORATE ACROSS DIFFERENT PARTNERS SO I I APPRECIATE WHEN YOU SAY OPENNESS AND ONE KNOW WHEN SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN -- AND BECAUSE OF THIS WE STARTED OFF IN THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE DYING SO I MEAN I I APPRECIATE THE IMPROVEMENTS AND I THINK THINGS ARE BETTER NOW BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE STARTED OFF BY SAYING -- YES -- WE HAVE LOWER PRESCRIPTION RATES -- FOR FEW AIDS WE HAVE YOU KNOW THAT WE THAT I THINK EVERY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE CERTAINLY THE OR DOING NOW IS BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAD BEFORE BUT OUR DEATH RATES ARE GOING UP. RIGHT MORE PEOPLE STILL DIE SO WE'LL GET MORE PEOPLE IN TREATMENT AT THAT BUT THE DEATH RATE STILL IT IS STILL. INCREASING. SO. OPEN THIS IS GREAT AND I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT I'M LOOKING FOR TO HEAR HEALTH DIRECTOR SAYING OKAY HERE'S OUR PLAN THIS IS AND THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND NOT THREE YEARS FROM NOW NOT NEXT YEAR -- I CARE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- WILL BE HEARING THIS ISSUE MAYBE I'D LIKE TO HEAR SOMETHING WHEN WE HAVE THAT COMMITTEE MEETING. OVERSIGHT DATING. SO I I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO TWENTY TWENTY IN THE WAIVER RENEWAL IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY DIVE AND VERY MEANINGFULLY WITH CONCRETE PROPOSALS OKAY SO YOU NINETEEN AND WE WOULD NEED THE SUBMIT THE WAIVER BY A WHAT TIME. IN THE LATE SUMMER EARLY FALL FOR THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN RIGHT THIS THIS SUMMER EIGHT YEAH SO SO WE NEED THE IDEAS ALREADY RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN PUT INTO THEIR SO THAT THAT THAT'S OUR TIMELINE RIGHT. YEAH I I APPRECIATE OF SO I MEAN I THINK I THINK THERE'S AN URGENCY THE I AND I AND AND THE TAKING OVER YOUR WORDS WE SAID OPEN I APPRECIATE THE OPENNESS BUT I'D LIKE OKAY Là HOW DO WE MOVE THINGS ALONG -- SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO YEAH WE WANT AND WE HAVE A FAIRLY NARROW WINDOWS A TIME A SAID THERE IS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DYING SO AS WE WAIT. OTHER PERSON DIES ANOTHER PERSON DIES. RIGHT. SO WE NEED TO MOVE. YES YEAH I AGREE WE WE NEED ACTION AND WE LIKE THE PLAN TO ACT RIGHT NOT THANK YOU THANK YOU -- AND SO EXT SO IN TERMS OF SO I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING AREA WE TALKED ABOUT THE LIGHT FLAVOR -- EIGHT SO WHAT KIND OF CHANGES DO YOU ANTICIPATE BAIT GIVEN THE LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED THAT DAY LOOKING FORWARD -- THIS THIS COMING WAIVER SO IF WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF STUFF WE HAVE AN EVALUATION WE'RE LOOKING FOR FUTURE REPORTS -- ETCETERA -- WHERE WHERE DOES THAT WHAT WOULD YOU LOOK LIKE WE'RE GOING WITH -- I MEAN I THAT AROUND SUBSTANCE USE I THINK THAT -- WE HAVE IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH PROVIDERS IN THE COUNTIES YOU KNOW SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY MISTER CINELLI TODAY HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN. RACE WITH US IN PRIOR CONVERSATIONS OVER THE MONTHS AND YEARS SINCE THAT WAIVER WAS APPROVED -- WE'VE ESSENTIALLY TOLD PEOPLE KEEP A RUNNING LIST -- BECAUSE WHEN WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE WERE READY AS A AS A DEPARTMENT TO KIND OF ENGAGE IN COLDER DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE -- TO KIND OF CRYSTALLIZE OUR PROPOSAL TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THERE'S PLACES WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR INPUT AND WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING CHANGES SO I THINK THAT -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE MENTIONED AROUND THE LENGTH OF STAY. THAT CAPS -- DAYS -- HAS CERTAINLY BEEN SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE HIGHLIGHTED FROM THE BEGINNING -- I WILL SAY THAT THAT WAS A FEDERAL ISSUE -- SO. YOU KNOW IT AT A CERTAIN POINT AND WE DO HAVE A NEGOTIATING PARTNER THAT WE HAVE. TO ALSO WORK WITH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND SO SOME OF THESE THINGS WERE SPECIFIC TO THEM AND AND REALLY ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT A NEW BENEFIT BEING. ROLLED OUT IN A WAY THAT THEY WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS GOING TO BE UTILIZED. I THINK -- THE WAIVER PRISON -- COUNTY SIR REGIONAL LIES -- AND FOR US TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT FUNDING AND FINANCING MECHANISMS I KNOW THAT -- CERTAINLY COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT HAS BEEN -- REYES NOT ONLY IN THIS ISSUE BUT IN THE MENTAL HEALTH -- WAIVER IN THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN WAIVER AS WELL AND SO I THINK. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A WE HAVE OUR UNLESS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THAT WILL BE WORKING TO KIND OF CRYSTALLIZED AROUND THINKING AROUND WHAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO RECOMMEND -- AS MAYBE A DRAFT PROPOSAL AND THEN HAVE STAKEHOLDERS RESPOND TO THAT SO IT IT'LL BE AN ITERATIVE PROCESS. YOUR GUIDE TO ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COURSE. THANK YOU -- AND BECAUSE THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS -- I I UNDERSTAND -- THAT IS VOLUNTARY YOU'VE SORT OF TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE REASONS WHY -- CONCERNS ABOUT. DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO SERVICES BETWEEN. RESIDENTS IN THE OPT IN COUNTIES VERSUS THE OPT OUT COUNTIES IS THAT SOMETHING. HOW WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT -- I MEAN I THINK THAT GOES TO THE DISCUSSION THAT -- WE HAD EARLIER AROUND THE THE THE VERY FEW COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT. PUT IN IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ARE VERY SMALL AND MOSTLY UPPER RURAL NORTH -- I THINK THAT WAS IN SOME CASES MY EFFORT TO REACH OUT TO SEE MUST BE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION -- TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT AND NARROW THAT -- BUT WE CANNOT REQUIRE COUNTIES TO PARTICIPATE I THINK THAT -- EVEN IN SPITE OF THAT THE COUNTIES WE WOULD WANT TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL IN PROVIDING THE REQUIRED MANDATED STATE PLAN SERVICES. THAT ARE THE LOWER LEVEL OF SERVICES THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN REQUIRED -- IN TERMS OF METHADONE -- OUTPATIENT DRUG FREE COUNSELING PERINATAL RESIDENTIAL INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT THERAPY -- THOSE ARE ALREADY REQUIRED OF THE COUNTIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE. IN THE PROCESS OF GOING INTO THE WAIVER OR NOT AND SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COUNTY STEVEN BRING THEM UP TO COMPLIANCE IN THOSE AREAS AND AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S AN ONGOING EFFORT BY OUR DEPARTMENT. AND NO QUESTION IS AND MAYBE IT'S A QUESTION FOR BOTH -- NO CHIEF PRESENT ALSO -- DOCTOR CONNELLY THAT HAPPENS FOLK BECAUSE SYSTEM AND CORRECT ME OF A ROCK. I MEAN. SO COUNTIES DON'T GET GRANTS FOR THAT RIGHT SO THAT'S KIND OF LIKE -- ANNALS OVERLAYS RIGHT WORDS SO IT'S IT'S SO YOU HAVE. THIS OPERATES TOGETHER. SO. YES PROVIDERS RIGHT SO SO SO I GUESS IN TERMS OF HOW ARE WE BRINGING THOSE TWO PIECES TOGETHER WE HAVE THE HAVE THE SCOPE SPOKE HERE WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE IDEA SO HOW HOW DO YOU SEE THAT COMING TOGETHER AND THE EVOLUTION OF THAT. BECAUSE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE NEXT WEAVER PROBABLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW THESE TWO INTERFACE. SO YES WHEN WE DEVELOP THE HUB AND SPOKE -- FIRST OF ALL ALL HUGS AND ANY SPOKES HAVE TO OFFER MEDICAL AS WELL I'M AND WE DID THAT FOR SUSTAINABILITY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO ENSURE FOR GOING TO INVEST IN TRAIN PHYSICIANS AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES -- THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THAT BUT WHAT'S CAN REACH BEYOND. THE MEDICAL PATIENTS SO WE CAN SERVE ANY INDIVIDUAL THAT WALKS THROUGH THE DOOR -- BUT SO IT REALLY HAS BEEN AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT GOES RIGHT THE FUNDING GOES RIGHT TO THE PROVIDERS -- BUT THEN OBVIOUSLY THE COUNTIES CAN ACCESS THOSE INCREASE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE NOW IN THAT THERE'S MORE M. A. T. AVAILABLE THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE -- FOR THE DRUG MEDI CAL WAIVER VINEY THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT LIKE HOW IT'S AT A FIXED AMOUNT OF MONEY OR IS IT OKAY SO IT'S IT'S JUST NINETY MILLION THAT IS JUST A YES JUST NINETY MILLION SO. AND OKAY. SO WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AND YOU SELL HOPING THAT THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET THERE'S AN EXTENSION OF THAT AND SO YES FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE HOW. THE INTERFACE WITH HAVE BEEN SPOKEN THE FUNDING THAT GOES THERE SURE SO THE THE FUNDING DOES GO DIRECTLY FROM FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO THE PROVIDERS THAT THEY CONTRACT WITH BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL IN OUR NETWORKS. WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DO COORDINATE VERY INTENTIONALLY WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE OF THAT -- WERE WORKING ON ON CONVENING SPOKES POSSIBLY FOR THEM IN THE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS THAT THEY ARE STANDARDIZING THEIR APPROACHES WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT HUBS FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'RE TRYING TO ALIGN MARKETING MATERIALS WE HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEM -- TO TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE OF POTENTIAL SPOKES IN THE COUNTY BECAUSE WE HAVE I THINK INFORMATION THAT IS IS HELPFUL TO THEM IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TO INCREASE THE REACH OF MIT SO THAT IS DEFINITELY I THINK SOMETHING THAT. COUNTIES ARE MINDFUL OF AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT. DUPLICATIVE OR UNCOORDINATED BUT RATHER SOMETHING THAT ADDS TO WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING IS PARTLY SAID. AND MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION. FOR ON THE PRIOR SPLIT -- ALICE BUT IS THERE CHALLENGES RECRUITING SPOKES. pSO YEAH IF CHALLENGES IN RECRUITING SPOKE OTHERS ACTUALLY IF IF MORE PEOPLE SIGN UP THE SPOKES WE COULD WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TAKE THE MONARCHY WILL FIX GRANT IT CETERA AND SO I'M JUST. JUST SAY CELL IS RATE LET ME STEP THE NUMBER PEOPLE WILLING TO BE SPOKES ARE THE NUMBERS FOLKS WERE ABLE TO HANDLE. YEAH SO THERE IS A CHALLENGING RECRUITING SPOKES -- BUT A LOT THE HUBS OF DONE AND THERE SPOKE A LOT ABOUT IT THEY WERE VERY AGGRESSIVE AND CAN'T AND AND REACHING AND AND WORKING WITH THE COUNTY PARTNERS THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WHOEVER'S IN THE AREA. TO GET MORE SPOKES ON BOARD -- THERE'S BEEN EFFORTS NOW TO HAVE JAIL SO SPOKES -- TRIBAL HEALTH CLINICS OTHER ENTITIES IT SEEMS LIKE MORE FOLKS ARE RAISING THEIR HANDS -- AT SOME POINT THOUGH IT DOES BECOME AN ISSUE A CAPACITY FOR THE HUB AS WELL I'M BECAUSE THAT'S A LOT OF SPOKE TO SOLVE. THE HOW THE DO WE NEED MORE HUBS TO YEAH SO THAT THAT BECOMES A CHALLENGE OF YOU KNOW AND IT'S BEEN A VERY QUICK RAMP UP AS YOU SEE THAT'S ONLY BEEN. IN EXISTENCE FOR A FEW YEARS -- BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT MORE INTEREST IN IT [inaudible] SO. THE KEYS WERE HUBS EIGHT AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT SUPER SPOKES BECAUSE AND MAY THE COMMUNITIES. IN TERMS OF DISTANCE OR OTHER THINGS THAT IT'S SO WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE SUPER SPOKES TO OKAY -- MAYBE I'LL JUST LIKE JUST LIKE IS THERE SOMETHING THAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO DO TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO BE. WILLING TO STAND UP AND BE SPOKES ARE SUPER SPOKES. WELL YES I THINK I THINK HAVING HAVING -- A A GENERAL -- CONSCIOUSNESS RAISING IF YOU WILL. THAT THIS IS A TOPIC THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT ON BROAD YEARS WHATEVER SORT OF MEETING THERE ISN'T SUBS TO BE USE. APPROACH TO SUBSEA PEWS AND AND SUCCESSFUL MODELS LIKE LIKE WHAT WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOUR THE OPENS FOCUS. I THINK UNQUESTIONABLY A SUCCESSFUL MODEL TO REACH OUT AND TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. UGH GIVEN ALL THE VARIOUS THINGS OUT OF IT THEN TALKED ABOUT -- YOU KNOW WE WE WE EVEN INC A COVER SIDE OF ADDICTION MEDICINE OR TO PARTICULAR ENTHUSIASM FOR PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS. VERY ENTHUSIASTIC GO OUT AND INNOVATE IN IN TREAT INTO ALL THESE KIND OF THINGS -- THE GENERAL POPULATION DOCTORS AT LARGE OR OR PERHAPS NOT SO EAGERTO TAKE ON ANOTHER SUBSPECIALTY X. EXPERIENCE. YOU KNOW PARTICULAR ONE THE STOKERS A STIGMA AND WE ALL TALK ABOUT TRYING TO REDUCE THE STIGMA AND AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME THE ORGAN AFTER PARTICIPATE AND AND ENCOURAGE THE WORK -- I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC. A GIVEN FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN CERTAINLY IN IN THE LARGER ORGANIZATION IN CALIFORNIA SITE EVERY DAY. OF COVERAGE OF ELECTION AS BUT ALSO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. RESIDENTS. MEDICAL STUDENTS FELLOWS ARE INCREASINGLY OPEN AND WILLING TO ENGAGE. THESE COME. SO I THINK GOING FORWARD IT IS ROLE WORTH OUR WHILE TO INVEST NOW. AND CONTINUE INVESTING NO I I THINK IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT HERE WE'RE SCRATCHING THE SURFACE. IN TREATMENT AND IDENTIFYING IN MANAGING THIS PROBLEM AND AND I THINK I THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF IT. THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK TO DO. IT IS VALLEY -- SORRY MY BUDGET HAD ON TO THE NINETY MILLION THAT WE GET I MEAN ARE WE EXPANDING IT ALL OF THE THAT THAT. OKAY I I GET IT I LIKE TO SAY THAT MY RELEASED WORKS AND WITH MONEY FALLING OUT OF HER POCKET. AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THAT WE GO WE PROGRESSIVELY TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO BE HUBS AND SPOKES AND SO FORTH AND WERE SUCCESSFUL AND THEY ACTUALLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WRAPPING THIS UP SO QUICKLY -- DOES IS SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO HIT WHERE -- WE NEED MORE MONEY THAN THAT NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT. WE KNOW THE DEMAND IS VERY GREAT SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT ARE WE GONNA HAVE A SITUATION YEAH. I GUESS THAT'S A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE A ONE LEVEL PERHAPS BUT BECAUSE IT'S A FIXED AMOUNT I MEAN THE TERMS OF HOW THE MONEY FLOWS IS THAT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE OR NOT -- THAT WE ARE POTENTIALLY RUN INTO SOME POINT ARE WE JUST FAR AWAY FROM THAT POINT YEAH SO GREAT QUESTION SO THE NINETY MILLION. I WAS ONLY FOR TWO YEARS A TECHNICALLY ENDS -- THIS APRIL BUT SINCE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT TOOK AWHILE FIRST TO RAMP UP -- TO GET THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE AND WE DO HAVE SOME CARRYOVER INTO A THIRD YEAR -- BUT THEN THOSE FUNDS WILL BE EXT THE OTHER GRANT IS ALREADY -- OBLIGATED TO OTHER PROJECTS SO YES THERE IS -- YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I I WILL SAY. AND WERE YOU KNOW THANKFUL FOR THAT MONEY BUT IT COMES VERY QUICKLY AND HAS TO BE SPENT VERY QUICKLY I MEAN THERE'S REALLY LITTLE NOTICE SO AT THIS POINT THE HUB AND SPOKE SYSTEM IS FUNDED. UP UNTIL ABOUT APRIL OF NEXT YEAR. AND THAT'S AS FAR AS WE AT THIS POINT -- NO THAT'LL BE FUNDED AND THAT'S FUNDED JUST AT THE THE LEVEL OF% THE SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW THERE ISN'T ANY ROOM FOR EXPANDING NOT CURRENTLY. OKAY SO WE ACTUALLY. TRY TO EXPAND THEIR SNOW WITH THEIR ART FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR THAT OKAY AND HOPEFULLY. KNOCK ON WOOD THERE. CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT CAN AGREE ON SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW EXTENSION OF THAT CONTINUE -- ACTUALLY DIGITAL WELL EXTENSION THE FUNDING NEEDED DIGITAL FUNDING RIGHT -- OVERTIME. OKAY ALL RIGHT ON THE IT WILL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND QUESTIONS -- NOW I WANT TO BRING UP -- FROM DEPARTMENTPUBLIC HEALTH -- WE HAVE -- STC ALAMO A CHIEF OF EACH -- WE HAVE -- JULIE AND I GUESS PSYCHO DEFEAT DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE IF YOU TAKE DEVELOPMENT EXTERNAL RELATIONS AND DR JAMES GREEN DEPUTY DIRECTOR CENTER FOR HEALTH. INFORMATICS ALL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- SOME FEDERAL GRANTS WE HAVE NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM MULTI AGENCY EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID CRISIS DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS. AND SO WELCOME --% A AND I THINK YOU'RE HER A YEAR HER DEPARTMENT CALLED OUT EARLIER RIGHT ABOUT PARTNERSHIP SO NOW YOU'RE HERE YOU CAN SPEAK FOR YOURSELF. HOW'S THE HOW'S IT GOING AND AS EVERYONE ELSE HELPING YEAH IS COOPERATING WITH YOU HELLO WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO COME SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING AROUND -- OPIATE OVERDOSE PREVENTION AND WE ARE A PROUD PARTNER OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF OF HEALTH SERVICES SO THANK YOU FROM UP FOR THAT -- AGAIN MY NAME IS STACY ALUM A MIX AND AYE SIR COMMUNITIES FRENCH I'M GONNA START US OFF BY GIVING YOU A VERY BRIEF UPDATE ON THE LOCKS ON GRANT PROGRAM -- SO AS YOU KNOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SENATE BILL EIGHT THIRTY THREE ESTABLISHED A NEW NALOXONE GRANT PROGRAM WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FATAL OVER OVERDOSES IN CALIFORNIA FROM OPIOID DRUGS BY INCREASING ACCESS TO NALOXONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. A TOTAL OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND WAS ALLOCATED ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH. TWENTY NINETEEN CITY PH OFFERED NON COMPETITIVE GRANTS OF THE LOCKS ON PRODUCT AND FUNDING TO ALL LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO CONDUCT NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION PROJECTS AND THEIR JURISDICTIONS. LOCAL DEPARTMENT GRANT RECIPIENTS CONDUCTED OUTREACH. AND THEY SELECTED LOCAL PROGRAMS AGENCIES A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS THAT SERVE POPULATIONS AT RISK FOR OPIOID OVERDOSE TO RECEIVE ALLOCATIONS OF NALOXONE. THROUGH THESE GRANT SIXTY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE NASAL SPRAY. FROM CITY PH. AND ACCORDING TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION PLANS WHICH ARE THE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT PRIOR TO THEIR ACTIVITIES -- THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE DISTRIBUTING THE LOCKS OWN TO ENTITIES SUCH AS SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES HOMELESS PROGRAMS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES JAILS. FIRE SERVICE AGENCIES EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES INCLUDING OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SCHOOLS. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL SUBMIT A FINAL REPORT TO CITY PH BY APRIL FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN TO FURTHER PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE TYPES OF ENTITIES. THAT RECEIVE NALOXONE FROM THEM THE TARGET POPULATION IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT RECEIVE NO LOCKS OWN FROM THE LOCAL ENTITIES. AND IF POSSIBLE THE NUMBER OF OVERDOSE REVERSALS THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THIS PROGRAM. SEE THE PAGE WILL SUMMARIZE THAT INFORMATION IN A FINAL REPORT DUE TO YOU ON JUNE. TWENTY NINETEEN I'M AT THIS POINT CITY PH DOES NOT HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL NALOXONE HOWEVER LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND OTHERS ARE NOW ABLE TO ACCESS THE LOCKS ON THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ONGOING NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION -- IN ENTITIES APPLYING FOR THAT -- NALOXONE THROUGH THAT PROGRAM ARE STILL ABLE TO UTILIZE OUR STATEWIDE STANDING ORDER FOR NALOXONE AS WELL AS THE NALOXONE ADMINISTRATION TRAINING THAT WE PRODUCER HAVE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. TO BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL. THANK YOU. JULY AND AUGUST TACO AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT EXTRA RELATIONS WILL EXPAND ON WHAT STACEY DESCRIBED -- IN PARTICULAR ADDRESSING THE STATE RIGHT OKAY SIXTY WORK GROUP AND OUR CURRENT FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS. C. PH WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH MANY PARTNERS HAS TAKEN A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTIVE ACTION APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING DYNAMICS OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE CITY PH DIRCTOR AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER HAS CONVENE THE STATE WIDE OPIATES SAFETY WORKGROUP OR SOS WORK GROUP WHICH PROVIDES A FORUM FOR COLLABORATION ACROSS VARIOUS STATE SECTORS TO ALIGN ACTIVITIES AND MESSAGES. I'M IN ADDRESSING THE EPIDEMIC. THE S. WAS WORK GROUP BRINGS TOGETHER OVER FORTY STATE AND NON GOVERNMENTAL STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPROVE COORDINATION AND EXPAND JOINT EFFORTS -- ADJUSTING APPEARED MISUSE ADDICTION AN OVERDOSE DEATH. CITY PH HAS RECEIVED MULTIPLE FEDERAL GRANTS BEGINNING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF OPIATE OVERDOSE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THE SOS WORKER. THERE'S BEEN CONTINUOUS FLUCTUATION IN FEDERAL FUNDING LEVELS AND AT THIS TIME THERE IS CONTINUED FUNDING FOR ON GOING COORDINATION OF THE SOS WORKGROUP. IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING THE WORK GROUP THESE FUNDING SOURCES HAVE SUPPORTED A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES INCLUDING. TO PROMOTE SAFE PRESCRIBING PRACTICES AND POLICIES WITH PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS. TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND UTILIZATION OF THE CURE'S PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM. TO IMPROVE DATA SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA OPIATES SURVEILLANCE DASHBOARD. COLLABORATION WITH CORONERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND EFFORTS TO IMPROVE DATA SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND INTRACTABILITY. WE ALSO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO BUILD AND STRENGTHEN LOCAL COMMUNITY COALITIONS. TO PROMOTE ACCESS TO MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AND THE LOCKS OWN. AND TO DEVELOP COMMUNICATION AND AWARENESS RESOURCES TO HELP -- ADDRESS THE RISKS OF OPIOID USE AS WELL. AROUND ADDICTION AND TREATMENT. ON AND SO THAT'S A QUICK SUMMARY OF OUR CURRENT ACTIVITIES AND AFTER THAT THE PANELISTS BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS COLLECTION OPPORTUNITIES. THE NATIONAL INTEROPERABLE A COLLABORATIVE HAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED A FIFTY TWO PAGE COMPREHENSIVE OPIOID RESPONSE THAT OF GARDENS ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE. EXPERIENCES ENTITLED THE OPIOID USE DISORDER PREVENTION PLAYBOOK. A KEY SUCCESS INDICATOR IDENTIFIED IN REITERATED THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT. IS THE NEED FOR A ROBUST DATA SHARING AMONG STAKEHOLDERS TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO ALL FACETS OF THE OPIOID CRISIS. IN CALIFORNIA WHILE THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY HAS ESTABLISHED INFORMATION SYSTEMS INTER OPERABILITY AND ATTENDED DATA SHARING AS A PRIORITY. AND WHAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE. IN CONVENE STATE. SPEC WIDE STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID CRISIS NOW. VIA THE STATEWIDE OPIOID SAFETY WORKGROUP. SUPPORT FOR A WIDER AND STRONGER INTRA AND INTER GOVERNMENTAL CULTURE DATA SHARING IS SEEN BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THIS AREA. AS NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE CALIFORNIA'S EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSE. TO THE OPIOID CRISIS IN ORDER TO AVERT OPIOID DEATH. AND NEAR DEATH ADVANCE AND ALL THE NEGATIVES QUALITY. OF OPIOID USE DISORDER IMPACTING CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU -- QUESTIONS. I THINK YOU'RE WITH THANK YOU -- JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THIS IS REGARDING THE WORK GROUP -- TO MENTION YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF STATE AGENCIES AND NGOS -- I KNOW I VISITED -- BACK AND I TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND ACTUALLY ASKED IS THERE MORE COULD BE MORE COLLABORATION WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR [inaudible] AND GROUPS OUT THERE IS SO THAT THE NGOS WHAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING THE PRIVATE THE THE PRIVATE SECTOR AT THIS POINT. ALSO THAT THE SO THE AT THE WORK GROUP LEVEL ONE OF OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS HAS BEEN INTO TO PART MEDICAL COLLABORATION ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WE HAVE SUPPORTING TASK FORCES THAT FOCUS ON SPECIFIC AREAS LIKE DATA COMMUNICATIONS. MATERNAL NEONATAL OPIOID EXPOSURE AND THOSE ARE OPEN TO ANY EXTERNAL STICK WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE SO THIS CAN BE PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN BE NGOS THAT CAN BE TREATMENT PROVIDERS -- THE CAN BE HEALTH PLANS. AND HOW HOW ARE YOU HOW IS THE OUT REACHING GETTING THEM THAT INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. YES I THINK THERE'S OBSERVE A BI DIRECTIONAL APPROACH THAT WE TAKE ONE IS TO TRY -- TO THAT WE'VE RECEIVED MANY INCREASE ABOUT THIS WORK AND REQUESTS TO PARTICIPATE AND SO THAT'S PART OF OUR ROLE AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH ENTITIES TO HELP FACILITATE THOSE. EXPLAIN WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND CONNECT THEM TO THE AREA OF FOCUS THAT MOST ALIGNS WITH THEIR NEEDS THE OTHER IS THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN VENUES WHERE THOSE STAKEHOLDERS ARE GATHERED THERE'S THAT. MARK KERR CALIFORNIA -- VENUE WHICH IS ORT OF MANY STATE PLANS AS WELL AS MANY HEALTH SYSTEMS IN PROVIDERS WERE PRESENT IN THOSE SPACES TO BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE AND MAKE THEM AWARE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE AND WORKER TASK THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. OUR FORTY MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS -- ACROSS THE DIFFERENT STATE BRANCHES ALSO DO THAT WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDER -- NETWORKS THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE SO THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE USE AT THIS TIME. A YOU MENTION A COLLABORATION WITH CORNERS MEDICAL EXAMINERS CAN DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT YES THAT'S TO HELP INCREASE THE DEPTH AND THE CONTEXT AROUND THE DATA WE HAVE AROUND -- A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS WERE TRYING TO DO IS BETTER UNDERSTAND. THE RISK PATHWAYS THAT ARE LEADING TO OVERDOSE WE CAN GET RID BECAUSE AND TARGET INTERVENTIONS MORE EFFECTIVELY. AND AS YOU'VE SEEN FROM THE DATA THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT DYNAMICS AT PLAY AT THE SAME TIME WITH OPIATES WE'VE GOT DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE AFFECTING SORT OF YOUNGER ADULTS VERSUS MIDDLE AGE WE'VE GOT THE SYNTHETIC AN ILLICIT OPIATES VERSUS PRESCRIPTION. SO WHEN WE WORK WITH CORNERS THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S ITS SHOULD HAVE THEM CAPTURE ADDITIONAL CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION AROUND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF AN OVERDOSE SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO USE THAT IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE RISK PATHWAYS. ARM AND I GUESS JUST OF FINE FINALLY AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE. KIND OF REPEATEDLY ASKED YOU KNOW. WE IS THE LEGISLATURE IN OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES OUT THERE. IS THERE WHAT CAN THE LEGISLATURE DUE TO HELP MOVE SOME OF THESE THINGS FORWARD BECAUSE I I'VE [inaudible] FEEL. WHILE THERE IS PROGRESS. LOOK IN MY RURAL COUNTIES WE CAN'T WE CAN'T GET WE CAN'T GET PROVIDERS TO ACTUALLY. TO WORK IN THE SPACE -- WE CAN'T GET ACCESS TO PEOPLE -- WE HAVE A WORK FORCE SHORES SO WHAT WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO AND THAT'S THE KIND OF GUIDANCE THAT I'M PERSONALLY LOOKING. FOR HELP US WITH DIED AND YOU IF YOU'RE IN YOUR SIX YEAR OF THIS TASK FORCE NOW. WHEN CAN WE EXPECT? SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP AS A GUIDE FOR FURTHER ACTIVITY THEY WORK A DOZEN BILLS LAST YEAR RELATED TO OPIOIDS OUT THERE -- AND YOU'RE DOING ALL THIS WORK BUT IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN BE DOING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING. THAT BASED ON ALL THE STUDY AND ALL THE WORK. THAT WE'RE MISSING HERE -- AND WHAT IS KIND OF WE'RE NOT THE I'M NOT THE EXPERT I'M NOT OF I'M NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT. BUT I AM. KIND OF WAITING. AND AND I'M I DON'T HOW LONG AM I GONNA BE WAITING OR IS OR WAS THERE EVER GONNA BE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT OF THIS WORK. THIS GROUP FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BE DOING AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL TO HELP MOVE THIS ALONG. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK JUST EVEN HEARING THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. IS OBVIOUSLY VERY ENCOURAGING TO THE MANY THE MANY DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT ARE WORKING IN THIS AND KNOWING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BE A KEY PARTNER IN THAT AND HAS FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I THINK I'VE ASKED THIS BEFORE THIS IS NOT CERTAINLY NO NOT AT ALL BUT I APPRECIATE YOU REITERATING THAT. I THINK THAT -- THESE VENUES WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE WHEN YOU REQUESTED THESE UPDATES FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SHARE. THE STATUS AND TO DO AGAIN ON THE BARRIERS I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS VERY HELPFUL CERTAINLY I THINK ANYTHING THAT IS HELPING US ELEVATE THE SALIENCE OF THE ISSUE AND THE ISSUE IT GREATER PENETRATION INTO THE AREAS WHERE WE'RE STILL SEEING GAPS. I THINK THAT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ROLE -- THAT YOU ALL ARE CURRENTLY PLAYING AND CAN CONTINUE TO PLAY I THINK THAT THERE WE'VE ALSO HEARD SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AROUND WHAT ARE THE SORT OF POLICY BARRIERS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY ADDRESS AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN. DIVING DEEPER TOGETHER ON IN SPECIFIC AREAS OF FOCUS -- BUT I THINK THAT THOSE ARE VERY HELPFUL I THINK THAT -- BE HAPPY TO ALSO GO BACK AND GET FURTHER INFORMATION TO PUT THEM IN TERMS OF SPECIFICS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT. IN THOSE MORE TANGIBLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS COMING OUT OF THE WORK GROUP. I'D ALSO SAY THAT ONE OF THE THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORK GROUP AT PRESENT IS LARGELY AROUND HOW DO WE AMPLIFY THE EXISTING ACTIVITIES THAT ARE HAPPENING. IN EACH ORGANIZATION ONE OF THE KEY GAPS THAT WE TRY TO ADDRESS IS TO BRIDGE THE SILOS ACROSS THE FUNDING THAT'S GOING OUT. AND TO HELP LINK UNDERSTANDING ACROSS SECTORS AND BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL SO. THAT VENUE IS PREDOMINATELY -- AND THAT THE ALSO COME THROUGH THOSE RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND THOSE PROGRAMS -- AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TO NARROW IN ON THAT. SO HOW'S THAT GOING. I THINK IT'S GOING VERY WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT THE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. EACH ONE OF THOSE ACTIVITIES IS SUPPORTED -- AND EXTENDED THROUGH THE COLLABORATION WE HAVE ACROSS OUR SECTORS THE DATA THAT WE'RE USING IN OUR DISCUSSION TODAY. AND THAT WE'VE ACCESS TO THE DATA DASHBOARD COMES FROM A PARTNERSHIP THAT IN IT WAS INITIATED WHEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SAID WE THINK THAT THIS. INFORMATION ABOUT PRESCRIBING COULD BE USED FOR PREVENTION BUT WE UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE MESSENGER FOR THAT. WHO CAN PARTNER WITH US TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE SO IT'S A SORT OF CROSS DEPARTMENTAL? LINKAGES TO BE ABLE TO FIND HOW WE CAN USE OUR RESPECTIVE STRENGTHS -- AND ADDRESS GAPS THAT I THINK ARE THE RESULT IN THE FOCUS OF THE WORK GROUP AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS PROGRESS. SO I GUESS I WOULD GO BUT AND OF I GUESS WE'LL TWO FIVE TWO QUESTIONS AND I'LL I'LL MOVE ON ONE IS -- WITH REGARDS TO QUARTERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS ARE IS THERE ANY PUSH TO ENCOURAGE -- REAL DATA SO WE ACTUALLY KNOW I MEAN ARE THEY DOING TOXICOLOGY SCANS ON ALL CASES THAT THEY SUSPECT MIGHT BE RELATED TO AN OVERDOSE. OUR AND IS THAT DATA AVAILABLE BECAUSE I DO WONDER ABOUT UNDER REPORTING QUITE FRANKLY. AND SO IS THE BAG TO THE THE PROBLEM BIGGER OR SMALLER OR DO WE ACTUALLY KNOW -- IF IF IF THEIR ACTUAL ECOLOGY ON ON THESE CASES OR DO WE KNOW THAT. I THINK THE INTENT OF THAT WORK IS TO EXPAND THE DEPTH AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT DATA AND TO EXPAND -- WHAT'S BEING COLLECTED THERE SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN INCREASING LEASING HAPPEN -- AND THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES AVAILABLE THAT ARE HELPING CORNERS THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S TO DO THAT BUT THAT OUT REACH HAS TO DO WITH HELPING THEM pUNDERSTAND. THAT NECESSITY AND TRY TO FIND. EXACTLY THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING IS HOW MUCH DO WE ACTUALLY -- HOW WIDELY ARE WE ACTUALLY CAPTURING THAT DATA? SO I GUESS IN MY FINAL QUESTION COME BACK TO YOU. I GUESS YOU KNOW AFTER FOUR YEARS I'M STILL KIND OF WAITING FOR THOSE. THIS COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL. COULD WE DO IS THERE SOME THE DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM. THIS COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK. I UNDERSTAND THAT MAY BE THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT. BUT I AS A EGISLATOR I'M SEEING PEOPLE DIE IN MY DISTRICT I AM WILLING TO TAKE A RISK ON MOVING A POLICY FORWARD THAT MIGHT BE CONTROVERSIAL. THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO ACCEPT IN THE IN THE IN THE GOAL OF TRYING TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND AND SO [inaudible] I GUESS. I'M HOPING FOR MORE THAN. I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT AND THE AND AND UP BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT GOVERNMENT HAS SILOS AND THAT FRUSTRATES ME. HUGE AMOUNT -- AND I WISH WE COULD NOT COME ALL DOWN WHICH ON A ROOM TO MAKE IT ALL WORK TOGETHER -- AND COLLABORATE ON THESE THINGS BUT I WILL GO BACK THAT I'M STILL WAITING FOR THOSE THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE THINK COULD WORK ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE. AND HELP US TO HELP BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM WHILE IT IS IS THE IS NOT GOING AWAY. AN AND LIKE I SAID WE'RE FIVE YEARS INTO THE YEAR IN THE SIX YEAR OF THIS TASK FORCE NOW. AND I BY AND OVER. FOUR YEARS AGO I'VE I I'VE ASKED THE SAME QUESTION. AND CONTINUE TO BRING IT UP AND I I HOPE THAT. I HOPE SOME IS LISTENING CLEARLY. WE'LL MAKE SURE WE ELEVATE THAT QUESTION WITHIN THE WORKGROUP. THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE I AM I AM GOING. TO FOLLOW UP. ON A DOCTOR WAS QUESTIONS AND YOU YOU HEARD BY QUESTIONS TOO I THINK YOU'RE IN THE AUDIENCE TO THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS. AND I THINK SAY REITERATE THEN IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS AND FORTY DEATHS ARE GOING UP. AND PEOPLE ARE DYING. AND SO -- SO I GUESS. ONE QUESTION IS IS THAT I APPRECIATE THAT NOW THE WORKGROUP BRING TOGETHER AND I HEAR A LOT OF ELEVATION AND SO FORTH CITING SO WHAT. WHAT IS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? I GUESS IS THE QUITE THINK THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION OR HEARING A LITTLE BIT LIKE OKAY SO WHAT ARE THE CORNERS DOING DIFFERENTLY NOW YOU'VE BEEN MEDIA THE CORNERS WHY THEY DECIDED TO WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW THAN. FOUR YEARS AGO WE STARTED WORK GROUP HAVE THEY CHANGED ANY WITH THE WAYS THEY DO AND I HAVE THE CHANCE AND THEY AGREED TO TO CHANGE THE WAY. YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY DO THAT HOW OFTEN THEY TEST. I GUESS NOBODY'S AFTER AND SEES FOR SUBSTANCE IS THE THAT THE TRAFFIC UP MAYBE MISSED CASES RIGHT -- ARE WE CHANGING AND WE CHANGED OR HOW AND ACTUALLY THE DATA PART YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF DATA WE COLLECT THE I ASKED THE THE VALUE. IS ABOUT -- DENOMINATOR EIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE CURES THE END OF CAPTIONS WE HAVE THAT THE THE WHOLE WEEK ARE WE I MEAN THIS IS. I HAVE A MASTERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH SO HE'S LIKE OKAY IT OUT -- BUT WE DO AIR BASIC PUBLIC HEALTH. WORK ABOUT GETTING THE DATA GATHERING THE DATA TOGETHER AND SAYING WHAT A MISSING ELEMENT ACID EVALUATORS I'LL ASK YOU TO IS LIKE WHAT OTHER DATA ELEMENTS DO YOU SEE NOW YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS THAT YOU. ARE MISSING THAT YOU NEED WE HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO COLLECT WHAT ARE WE DOING THAT IN THE LAST. WHAT ARE WE DOING DIFFERENTLY IN THERE'S A REASON WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING? RIGHT I MEAN SELF TALK ABOUT ELEVATION WE'RE HAVING A HEARING TODAY ABOUT THIS RAY CRISIS WE PLAN TO TAKE THE INFORMATION FROM THIS HEARING AND THEN MOVE FORWARD WITH ACTIVITY ON THE LEGISLATURE. WE ALSO YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR BRAIN AND WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER. BUT WORKING TOGETHER IS NOT JUST BEATING. YOU KNOW AND MEETING IN MEDIAN MEETING ANDERSON UTILITIES A MEETING BUT THEN AT THE THAT CONVERSATION LEADS TO CHANGE. LEADS TO DIFFERENT KINDS ACTIVITIES SO YES ALL PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT -- WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT SOME MAY NOT REQUIRED LEGISLATION THAT'S FINE -- BUT I WE CAN RE COLLECTING THE KIND OF DATA WE'RE DOING A WE DOING THE KIND OF SURVEILLANCE THAT'S NECESSARY TO TO GET AN ACCURATE. ESTIMATE OF WHAT'S GOING ON SO WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW -- WHO'S YOUR ADDICTED. YOU HAVE THE OTHER TYPES SO A READ WE DO WE HAVE THE KIND OF INFORMATION ARE YOU WORKING WITH EVALUATORS WE HAVE JUST HEARD FROM SOME VALUES THE OPEN UP THIS HEARING. ARE YOU WORKING WITH EVALUATORS THE TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT KIND OF DATA APPRECIATE WE HAVE A WORK GROUP THAT'S A MEETING FOR HOW MANY YEARS NOW BUT WHAT HAS CHANGED IN THAT SENSE THAT WORK GROUP CAME TOGETHER IN TERMS OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING WHAT. WE DOING DIFFERENTLY NOW AND AND THEN OF COURSE GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH RIGHT AND SO THAT CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR WHAT KIND OF CHANGE AND OUTCOMES THAT LEAD. TO AND WE MEASURING THAT. SO -- IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION -- THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IS CURRENTLY DESIGNING A DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CONNECTS. ITS INTERNAL REGISTRIES IS SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS SUPPORT SYSTEMS SPECIFIC. TO THE OPIOID CRISIS. THE SYSTEM IS BEING DESIGNED TO MONITOR FATAL AND NONFATAL OPIOID EVENTS. DATA COLLECTION FROM DATA SOURCES INCLUDE VITAL RECORDS THE FELLA. OCCUPY PATIENT DISCHARGE AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ALLAH. CAL READY LABORATORY DATA GETTING HERE TOXICOLOGY QUESTION GERMAN -- EMSA PRE HOSPITAL DOWN. AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CURES PRESCRIPTION DOWN -- THESE DATA SOURCES WILL BE MONITORED AT THE STATE AND SUB STATE LEVEL OVER TIME AND ACROSS DEMOGRAPHIC ATTRIBUTES INCLUDING GENDER RACE ETHNICITY AGENT RESIDENTS. AND CURRENTLY A PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS SERVICE IS BEING DEVELOPED A MONITOR OPIOID RELATED PRESCRIPTION KAREN'S. AND PROVIDE TREND DATA ON A REGIONAL BASIS TO STAKEHOLDERS. THIS STATUS OF THE PROJECT WAS ANTICIPATED TIME OF WELL COMPLETION IN TERMS OF AT LEAST HAVING THOSE CAPABILITIES I REALIZE THIS IS. SOMETIMES AN EVOLVING THING AS WELL BUT WHAT WHERE ARE WE WITH THIS. NOW -- JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW AND THEN A THE CARD MONIES FEDERAL MONIES BECAME AVAILABLE. I BELIEVE IN LATE SEPTEMBER. BY A MID DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAD HIRED THE SIX DEDICATED -- INDIVIDUALS OF SKILL SETS FOR THIS KIND OF WORK TO THE ANALYTICS SERVICES UNIT. ARE WE ON BORDER THEM DURING JANUARY FEBRUARY AND FOR THE CONTRACT -- WITH THE SOFTWARE MIDDLEWARE -- VENDOR TO BRING IN THE TECHNOLOGIC SOLUTION THAT THEY COULD WORK WITH -- WE ANTICIPATE USING THE OPIOID USE CASE AS I'VE MENTIONED HERE. AS OUR FIRST USE CASE AND WE HOPE TO HAVE A PROOF OF CONCEPT -- DETERMINED BY MID AUGUST OF THIS YEAR. HEY AND THEN THEN WE CAN SCALE BEYOND THAT OF THAT IT IF THAT IS SUCCESSFUL IT'S ALWAYS A PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT. IS THE CELLS AT A THAT'S NOT WORKING SYSTEM YET RIGHT THAT. IS AN HONOR WORKING SYSTEM IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT WHICH BASICALLY SAYS. CAN WE IN FACT COLLECT ALL THIS TO SOME PLACE TO WAY OF THE COORDINATION PLACE. WE HAVE A DATA DICTIONARY THAT CAN TAKE THE DATA FROM DIFFERENT VOCABULARIES AND INTEGRATED. CAM WITH THEM PROCESS THAT ON THE INGESTION SOFTWARE CAN WE MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THE ANALYTICS SOFTWARE WILL GIVE US THE OUTPUTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO INFORM DECISION MAKING. SO NOW WOULD YOU SELL ASSUMING YOUR PROOF OF CONCEPT WORKS OUT SO THIS IS AUGUST THEN DO YOU HAVE THE FUNDS TO THAN ACTUALLY MAKE A WORKING SYSTEM OR IS THAT HOW MUCH FEDERAL FUNDS YOU HAVE IS IT JUST THE TO PROVE CONCEPT IS ACTUALLY ENOUGH. THANK YOU THROUGH TO IMPLEMENTATION -- JULIE PERHAPS YOU CAN HELP ME WITH THIS BUT I BELIEVE THE CDC COED FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. THROUGH THE CURRENT FEDERAL HERE AND SANSA FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE IN TWO NEXT YEAR WHICH IT HELPS SUPPORT THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT THE SIX POSITIONS GOING FORWARD [inaudible] THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY SO THOSE WE CAN GET THE PROOF OF CONCEPT WE'RE NOT SURE WE CAN GO BEYOND THAT FUNDING WEISS. OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW YOU WANT YOU-APPROVED THE CONCEPT BUT OKAY -- AND I BELIEVE WILL PRY HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS THAN BUDGET I UNDERSTAND. OKAY RIGHT BECAUSE I NEED THAT THAT'S THE CUT RATE WE NEED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH ABOUT RIGHT SO. IT WERE A DARK ROOM WE NEED THE LIGHT SO WE CAN SEE WHICH WAY TO GO WE CAN FIND A WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OTHERWISE WERE. PLAINLY WINE AROUND -- OKAY [inaudible] AND SO I I THINK ONE OF THINGS I I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE NINE ON OF WAS IS ACTUALLY -- I DON'T AS THEY RECOVER REPORT ON THIS SOS I MEAN I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LIST OF LIKE OKAY THE THINGS THAT. THAT ARE TO HELP DIFFERENCE SINCE WE STARTED. RIGHT -- I RELEASE THE FEDERALLY FUNDED SO -- BUT I MEAN IT LIKE TO KNOW LIKE WHAT WHAT KIND OF CHANGES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS COMING OUT YEARS OF DISCUSSION. AND THE PLAN TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THOSE CHANGES NOW HOPEFULLY MAYBE WE HAVE THE SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BETTER MEASURE THAT. RIGHT AND THEN ALSO BILL THIS IS WE TALK ABOUT COLLABORATION SAMPLE ARE YOU WORKING WITH THE BEAVER HEALTH DIRECTORS I JUST CHALLENGED THEM TO SAY WELL WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE SMALLER COUNTIES MEDIUM SMALL COUNTIES WHO DIED THE INFRASTRUCTURE. RIGHT SO IT'S GREAT TO HEAR FROM THE SUCCESSES BUT I WONDER WHY THE ONES WHO ARE DOING AS WELL. AND I LET OUT COMPLETELY OUT THERE DID THAT THE ONE THAT ARE PERFORMING AT THAT'S GREAT TO TALK TO THE TOP PERFORMERS BUT ALSO I WANT NO WORD IN MIDDLES GOING SO I ARE YOU INVOLVED IN THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION ARE NOW IS THAT SEPARATE DISCUSSION. WITH BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS YES ME SO I BELIEVE THERE ARE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS THAT ARE PARTICIPANTS -- THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENING IN YOUR GROUP RIGHT NOW OR NOT THE VERY CORE CONVERSATION I JUST HAD WITH -- THE GENTLEMAN FROM LA IS THAT EVEN BEEN THE TOPIC OF YOUR DISCUSSION. I THINK THAT THE CERTAINLY THE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF UPTAKE AND THE MAKING THE EXPANSION OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AVAILABLE IN ALL SETTINGS AND ALL COUNTIES HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A PRIORITY SO LET ME JUST ASK ANOTHER QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE TALKING ABOUT CHALLENGES. IS THE GROUP TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS [inaudible] CERTAINLY OKAY. AGAIN I WANT TO REITERATE RIGHT THAT THE THE WAY THAT THE WORK GROUP FUNCTIONS. IS TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE SECTORS TOGETHER RIGHT UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE DOING WITHIN THOSE SILOS THAT YOU DESCRIBE THIS AND THE FUNDING THAT COMES DOWN TO SUPPORT THAT WORK. IN THE ACTIVITIES OR DESCRIBED% THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS WELL AS OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THAT VENUE. IS TO INFORM EACH OTHER'S WORK WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE FROM EACH OF THOSE SECTORS AND PERSPECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHEN DEVELOPING THE ROLLOUT OF THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKE SYSTEM. PART OF THE SUPPORT THE DH CS HAS BUILT IN COLLABORATION PUBLIC HEALTH IS WE NEED TO RAMP UP LOCAL COMMUNITY COALITIONS RIGHT SO THAT'S A PRACTICE THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEN SHARED THROUGH OUR WORK GROUP. WITH THE EXPERIENCE TO TEACH THE S. AND THE DATE AMPLIFY KLAY THE INSIGHT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHICH IS WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS AND A LOCAL COMMUNITY. THAT ARE COMING UP AND IT'S THIS COALITION VENUES THAT HELP US TO IDENTIFY THOSE SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE SORT OF THE INTERCHANGE THAT OCCURS TO INFORM. AND MORE EFFECTIVELY DIRECT THE RESOURCES AND EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE IN EACH DEPARTMENT THAT'S PART OF THE BENEFIT OF THAT. BUT THE DESTRUCTION THAT WE HAVE ON THE WORK GROUP IS TO HELP. MORE EFFECTIVELY INFORM EACH OTHER'S WORK AND EXTEND THE IMPACT OF THAT WORK SO NOT ONLY TO SORT OF CONVENE AND THEN COME UP WITH WHAT WE THINK THE ISSUES ARE TO BE ABLE. TO ACTIVELY INFLUENCE EACH OTHER'S WORK AS IT'S OCCURRING RIGHT NOW. OKAY SO IT'S I THINK IT'S AND IN THE END OF THE DAY I'M SURE GOOD STUFF IS COMING OUT OF THIS I THINK WHAT. AT LEAST. I CAN ALMOST BE FOR DOCTOR WHAT'S BUT I MEAN I THINK WE'RE A FEELING A LITTLE FRUSTRATION IN THE SENSE THAT. WE CERTAINLY SEE VALUE IN THE GROUP AND I'M SURE YOU'RE DOING IT BUT I'M NOT HEARING AS MUCH AND I REALIZE I GIVE YOU A VERY LIMITED ABOUT TIME TO PRESENT IS. SOMETHING ABOUT LIKE WHOA OKAY SO WHAT HAS COME OUT OF THE GROUP THAT HAS LED TO CHANGE RIGHT. OKAY MEANS GREAT FOR PEOPLE TO TALK TOGETHER AND THAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS TO DOING THIS AND NOW AND TO BREAK THOSE SILOS BUT THEN THE THING IS IS THAT OKAY FINE YOU'RE TALKING BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED RATES FOR EXAMPLE. THEY YOU SAID OKAY FINE BECAUSE WE MET TOGETHER WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE EXPERTISE DEPART PUBLIC HEALTH THAT DTS WHEN HAVE HAD ACCESS TO WIN IT THOUGHT ABOUT TO DO MORE REACH OUT REACH THAT ADDRESS THE STIGMA. AND I DON'T OF THAT REALLY HAPPENED OR NOT BUT I'M JUST TRYING FROM RIGHT SO I MEAN THAT THE DATA HELPFUL TO NOW. AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES CONCERN OR AMBIGUITY AROUND THOSE GETS ELEVATED THERE THERE'S A FASTER CAPACITY FOR US TO COLLECTIVELY RESPOND. IN A AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE WHEN THERE'S SORT OF THE CURES MANDATED REGISTRATION THE MANDATED USE OF EMERGING CONCERN AROUND THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY BUT WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE'RE WE'RE IDENTIFYING THAT THERE ARE PATIENTS THAT WE'RE NOT SURE HOW TO TRANSITION. WE COLLECTIVELY ARE ABLE TO HELP PROVIDE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT FOR THAT AND THEY COME OUT WITH UNIFIED MESSAGING. ARE UNINSURED AGENDA OF HOW WE WANT. TO HOWARD COLLECTIVELY AGREEING TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES OKAY AND AGAIN I AM ACTUALLY I I THINK THAT ONE THE VERY IMPORTANT ROLES OF THAT THE BAR PUBLIC HEALTH IS THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO THE SURVEILLANCE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH RIGHT. WHAT'S GOING ON WHERE IT IS SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON WHERE WE ARE ON THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT TOO FOR CONCEPT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GO FROM PREFER CONCEPT SOMETHING THAT CAN GIVE US KIND OF TOOLS WE NEED TO BETTER DIRECT. RESOURCES WE WANT DIRECTOR TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF THE OPIOID DATA DASHBOARD AS WELL THAT THAT WE RUN SO THAT HAS. RADIATION ER VISITS AND PRESCRIBING ALL AT ONCE AND IT'S A QUERY SYSTEM SO. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE USEFULNESS OF THAT SO THAT'S COUNTIES IN COALITIONS CAN GO ON AND GET. THE MOST -- EASILY ACCESSIBLE INFORM THEIR LOCAL EFFORTS AS POSSIBLE AND THEN WE DO USE THAT TO RUN SURVEILLANCE AND LOOK OBSERVE AND TRACK EXCELLENT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT AND AGAIN THAT'S ONE OF OUR PUBLIC. OKAY EXCELLENT. JUST A COUPLE OF MINOR THINGS HERE SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BARRIERS AND AND THEIR STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING AREAS I ASSUMING THAT YOU THAT THERE'S A REEVALUATION OF HOW THAT'S THOSE ARE WORKING. THAT'S WORKING I THINK THAT'S CONTINUOUS ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT ESPECIALLY WITH THIS ISSUE WERE SAYING THAT EACH STEP WE IDENTIFY THAT THERE ARE NEW CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH. WHAT'S THE SUPPORT THAT'S NEEDED TO SUSTAIN THAT STEP. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ABSOLUTELY IS CONTINUOUSLY BEING RE EVALUATED AND AND THOSE INFORMATION CHANNELS COMMUNITY COALITIONS ARE MULTI SECTOR WORKERS ARE VENUES WHERE THOSE ISSUES ARE SURFACED AS WELL AS WITHIN OUR RESPECTIVE PROGRAMS. THE ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD FROM FROM THE GENTLEMAN FROM TARZANA TODAY WAS. THAT THAT SYSTEMS DON'T COMMUNICATE AND AND SO ARE THOSE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE EVALUATING AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS OF THE PROVIDERS CAN ACTUALLY. PROVIDE RATHER THAN HAVE TO SPEND THEIR TIME DOCUMENTING A I MEAN I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THE BREASTS OF THE WORKGROUP CENTER WITH WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE AN INTER OPERABILITY INITIATIVE. THAT WE BRANDIS SPEAKER SYSTEM OF DATA SHARING WHICH IS AN IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM PROJECTS TO IMPROVE INTER OPERABILITY. BOTH WITHIN THE SYSTEMS WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AND STATE ANOTHER FEDERAL PARTNERS BEYOND THAT. AT THE AGENCY LEVEL THERE'S A TAB THAT A SUB COMMITTEE WHICH IS THAT WORK. ON THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE THE STATE AND AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THERE WITH A HUGE WHITE SPACE AND SOME OF THE RURAL AREAS IN REGARDS INNER OPERABILITY THAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS. THAT IS PART OF THE PROCESS YES SIR SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. I GUESS THE FINAL THING IS AN VERY THE VERY BEGINNING WE TALKED ABOUT. HOW THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES? AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION AND SO WHAT SO. THAT SEEMS TO CONTINUE TO BE A GLARING PROBLEM SO ARE THERE STRATEGIES THAT ARE BEING EMPLOYED TO HELP WITHOUT REACH THE TRAVEL COMMUNITIES AND THOSE ARE CONTINUING TO BE REEVALUATED. YES SO THERE I FIND OUT INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. MY FOR MY COMMUNITY THE CALIFORNIA RURAL INDIAN HEALTH BOARD. AS A RECENTLY -- REACHED OUT TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEY HAVE JOINED. THE STATE WIDE OPIOID -- SIXTY WORKGROUP PAN ARE PRESENT AND ENGAGE IN A PROCESS AND THEY'RE HELPING US REACH OUT FURTHER OR TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND SUBSETS WITHIN THE TRAVEL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. PRIOR TO THAT THEY WERE TO PART OF THIS PROCESS THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AT THEIR YEAH. THE I'M JUST TRYING TO THEY WERE NOT A PART OF THIS UNTIL JUST RECENTLY. THEY RECENTLY JOINED THE WORKERS THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE NOT A PART OF THE PROCESS. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY HAD NOT BEEN PARTICIPATING AS A STATEWIDE ENTITY. THEY ALSO RECENTLY RECEIVED SOME FUNDING TO INCREASE THEIR OWN CAPACITY WHICH IS ALLOWED THEM TO PUT INCREASED FOCUS. ON THIS ISSUE AND THEIR PARTICIPATION THERE. WE'VE ALSO BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THEM ON THE DATA FRONT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. THE NATURE OF THE BURDEN -- ON TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAD ABOUT DATA AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER WITH THEM ON WHAT I'M GLAD THERE THAT THE KIND. THIS IS A NUMBER THIS IS THIS ISN'T NOT I KNOWN THAT THEY BEEN THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THIS WITH THESE. WITH THESE COMMUNITIES FOR A LONG TIME I'M JUST SURPRISED IT'S TAKEN SO LONG. FOR THEM TO BE A PART OF THE WORKGROUP. WELL OKAY I'M JUST I GUESS I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT -- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU TALK ABOUT TECHNICAL CHALLENGES ARE PROBLEMS ARE JUST THINGS LIKE THAT SOME OF THESE. HAVE HAVE INTERNET ISSUES A A LOT OF A RIDE A HUGE HUGE HUGE CHALLENGES AND THESE. I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE IN GENERAL HEALTH THAT WE ENGAGE WITH OUR TRAVEL COMMUNITIES MORE. THEY OFTEN FEEL LEFT OUT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WEATHER'S OPIOIDS OR ALCOHOL OR OR JUST IN GENERAL -- IT'S A IT'S A HUGE HUGE CHALLENGE -- FOR PEOPLE AND WHEN WITH WITH GUARDS OPIOIDS WHEN THEY'RE DIED AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF OF OF SOMEONE IS CAUCASIAN -- I I JUST. I JUST WONDER WHY THEY WERE AT THE TABLE CENTER BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER THAT'S ANOTHER DISCUSSION. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE SURE PUBLIC HEALTH AS PART OF THIS HEARING -- I KNOW IT. DOESN'T ALWAYS SEEM LIKE FUND. BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE SO IMPORTANT TO THIS AND WE NEED YEAH WE NEED THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE DOING I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE YOU KNOW CONVENING PEOPLE AND HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT ALSO WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WERE. WERE MOVING THINGS AHEAD I THINK IS -- BOTH -- SELLER WOULD NIGHT SAYING THAT. WE HAVE PEOPLE DOING PILOTS WE HAVE. OTHER THINGS BUT PEOPLE ARE DYING AND WE NEED TO ACT MORE QUICKLY RIGHT SO IT'S GREAT FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND TALK AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO FORTH AND ETCETERA BUT WE'RE ALSO. PARTISAN RANTINGS HEARINGS TO PUSH FOR ACTION NIGHT OKAY FINE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. WHERE WE CAN DO RIGHT I'M GLAD YOU'RE OPEN TO DIFFERENT IDEAS BUT OPEN DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING I SO WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP OKAY NOW YOU'RE OPEN LET'S GET TO THE NEXT UP AND DO SOMETHING? RIGHT AND I'M NOT SAYING PEOPLE ARE DOING THINGS IN FACT WE JUST HEARD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS PEOPLE ARE DOING BUT WE THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND AND WE WILL WE WILL WANT TO SEE. ADDRESS AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY MORE FOCUSED ON THE PRESCRIPTION SIDE OF THINGS BUT NOW I'M AND I AM CERTAINLY NOT GONNA GO AND RIGHT OFF THE PEOPLE READY ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW FROM SOME SO WE DON'T LIKE MORE PEOPLE. ENTERING THE PIPELINE INTO SUBSTANCE USE BUT WE ALSO CAN'T ABANDON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM SUBSTANCE USE AND THAT MEANS THAT'S ACCESS TO TREATMENT. THAT'S ALSO. YOU KNOW THE FUTURE OF THE OF THE SPORTS THAT WE HAVE THE DATA TO SHOW IT'S SET IT TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE MAKING PROGRESS ON THAT AS WELL AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THAT. PUBLIC HEALTH IS DOING THE WE'D LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE MORE FROM YOU ABOUT. THE THINGS AND I'M LOOKING FOR TO THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE TO YOU PROVIDE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW WITH. BREAKING PROGRESS AND OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. OKAY SO WE'RE PUBLIC COMMENT -- SO PEOPLE CAN LINE UP THE MICROPHONE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES OR LESS. BUSES ACCEPTABLE -- WE'VE HAD A LONG HEARING BUT ALSO WE DO WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU AND IT AND SO I APPRECIATE SO PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME THE ORGANIZATION WITH IF YOU'RE A WITH AN ORGANIZATION AND LOVE. AND LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU HIGH YOUR SILENCE I'M HERE YOU DAILY WITH CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS AND I REALIZE I'M PLAYING TO A DWINDLING HOUSE AND A HUNGRY CROWD. SO KEEP IT SHORT I BASIC FELT COMPELLED TO OME UP -- FOR CHAIRMAN WOULD. AB QUESTIONS HE KEEPS SAYING WIRE PEOPLE AND MY DISTRICT DYING AT HIGHER RATES THAN OTHER DISTRICTS. AND THEN THE FOLLOW UP IS WHAT THE HECK CAN BE DONE AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU GOT ANSWERS TO EITHER OF THOSE QUESTIONS TODAY. SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HUB AND SPOKE IS WONDERFUL IT'S GREAT IT'S LOVELY. IT'S BASICALLY A MEDICATION DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND I WOULD BE. NOT TO SAY THAT IF YOU HAD MEDICATION FRICTION. AVAILABLE FREE AT EVERY CDS IN YOUR DISTRICT I DON'T KNOW THAT MAKE THAT MUCH IMPACT IN THE RURAL AREAS. WHAT'S MISSING IS -- PEOPLE ARE DYING BECAUSE THEY LIKE SEVERAL SPEAKER SAID ARE NOT AWARE THEY HAVE ADDICTION OR THEY'RE NOT AWARE HOW TO GET IT TREATED. SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO A POINT TO THE OTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WERE RELAPSE. SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHANNELS TO GET ILLEGAL DRUGS THE MOST DANGEROUS OF WHICH IS SPENT ON I'M THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO KNOW HOW TO USE THEM. AND THEY HAVE A VERY LOW TOLERANCE -- RELAPSING FROM HER ONE IS BASICALLY DEADLY IN MANY CASES. SO WHAT'S MISSING IN YOUR AREA IN MANY AREAS IN THE STATE IS THE COUNSELING THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. AND THERE'S A STRUCTURAL REASON WHY IT DOESN'T EXIST IN THE ROLE COUNTY. AN OUTPATIENT TREATMENT CENTER AND THAT IS THE LICENSE TO GET REIMBURSEMENT PROVIDE SERVICES. IS A MULTI THOUSAND DOLLAR APPLICATION. IT'S NOT SUITABLE TO A ONE OR TWO PERSON ENTITY. PRIVATE PRACTICE. SO YOU REALLY CAN'T PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN THE DRUG MEDI CAL SYSTEM. WITHOUT A LICENSE. NOBODY PAYS YOU. ALSO NO ONE PAYS YOU AS THE NEWSPAPER PRACTITIONERS THROUGH INSURANCE UNLESS YOUR LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE A LICENSE. PREDICTION COUNSELORS. SO WE COULD KEEP POURING MONEY INTO PROVIDING MEDICATION. BUT IT'S THE COUNSELORSWHO. MEET WITH THE PARENTS. WITH THE CLIENT MOTIVATE THEM MAKE THEM REALIZE HEY I'VE GOT A PROBLEM AND HERE ARE THE WAYS YOU CAN ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. THEY'RE ALSO CRITICALLY NECESSARY TO THE FOLLOW UP TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM RELAPSING SO OUR MODEL NOW IS. GET SO SICK. THAT YOU HAVE TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED FOR THIRTY DAYS FOUR HOURS FROM YOUR HOME AND ANOTHER COUNTY. GET OUT OF BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED HAVE NO FOLLOW UP OR MAYBE SOME MEDICATION YOU MIGHT BE MOTIVATED TO USE. AND WE EXPECT THAT TO WORK WE DON'T DO THIS WITH ANY OTHER DISEASE. IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE WAIT I'M THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT I SMALL OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS. THAT COULD BE DONE. IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY THE DEPARTMENT COULD ISSUE SMALL OPPOSITION LICENSES. TO INDIVIDUAL PRACTITIONERS WHO HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK WHO ARE ALREADY CERTIFIED TO WORK AND LARGER PROGRAMS. AND ALLOW THEM TO DO THIS WORK WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE THAT COULD HAPPEN. AT THE END OF THE SESSION WE CAN GET THOSE SMALL OUTPATIENT LICENSES GOING IN LIEU OF WAITING FOR THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH HAS ALREADY PASSED A LICENSABLE TWICE FOR THIS PROFESSION TO FINISH THAT NEEDED WORK SO THAT NOT ONLY PEOPLE ON MEDICAL BUT ALL PETITIONS COULD ACCESS CARE LOOK LIKE. THANK YOU AND ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE SOME MATERIAL OR SOMETHING IN THAT REGARDS -- PLEASE SHARE WITH US I WILL CERTAINLY THANKS VERY MUCH WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M FOR MCDADE TING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES SEE SACK REPRESENTING THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS IN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. IT'S A GREAT AND VERY THOROUGH HEARING WERE SPECIALLY HARDENED TO SEE PUBLIC HEALTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH ANGLE BECAUSE THE HARM REDUCTION ANGLE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND EVEN IN COUNTY LAND PUBLIC HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH ARE LEARNING TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE SOME OF THE GREAT LESSONS LEARNED FROM PUBLIC HEALTH CAN BE ACT APPLICABLE TO ADDICTION TREATMENT -- I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE OF THE DRUG MEDICAL PROGRAM AND THE DRUG MEDI CAL WAIVER IS A DEMONSTRATE THAT HAVE SO MANY COUNTIES JOIN IN -- DUE TO THE GREAT WORK I THINK DH CS AND MS PRESENT OTHERS HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET AS MANY COUNTIES AS POSSIBLE IN THE PROGRAM AND I WANT TO COMMEND THEM FOR THAT. AS WELL AS OUR PER COMMUNITY PROVIDERS WHO ARE PARTNERING WITH COUNTIES TO OFFER THE SERVICES -- AND WE HEAR THE NEED FOR NEW IDEAS YOU HEARD A FEW -- I'VE TALKED WITH A DIRECTOR CAN'T AND OTHERS ABOUT CMS P. -- POTENTIALLY DOING DRUG MEDICAL THEY'RE ALREADY IN THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE GREAT JPA THEY DO A REALLY GOOD JOB ALREADY SO THEY'RE A GOOD VEHICLE FOR THAT -- ALSO PAYMENT REFORM YOU'VE HEARD SEVERAL IDEAS FOR THAT SO WHERE IT WILL BE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SERVICES ARE GETTING. IN ALL AREAS THE NEED TO GET IN AND WITH THE NEXT WAVE -- HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE IT WILL BE A DEMONSTRATION ANYMORE THAT THE HUB AND SPOKE MODEL IN THE WAIVER WILL BE WHAT BECOME STATEWIDE. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. DOCTOR PAN DOCTOR WOULD ACKNOWLEDGING THEM THE SECOND TO LAST PERSON KEEPING YOU FROM YOUR NEXT MEETING YOUR LUNCH I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS VERY BRIEF -- I'LL HUDDLED ON WITH THE WHITE MAN GROUP HERE ON BEHALF OF CAL CLARA TODAY WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE CONTINUE TO FOCUS AT THIS COMEDIAN YOU TO HAVE BEEN. I'M GIVING A SHINING A LIGHT STILL ON THIS ON THIS OPIOID WHICH CONTINUES THE CRISIS WHICH OF COURSE IS AN EPIDEMIC AND WE WANNA FIND SOLUTIONS TO IT -- WE WANT TO ASK THAT BOTH COMMITTEES ALSO DEDICATE THE SAME OF TIME AND ATTENTION TO PREVENTION. TREATMENT ARE -- WE DEFINITELY THINK THAT IN THE LONG RUN IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY KERR OF THIS OPIOID CRISIS. IS BY INTEGRATING NON PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS -- OF COURSE CHIROPRACTIC CARE PHYSICAL THERAPY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY'RE ALL I AM NUMBER MONOCLE TREATMENT OPTIONS IN THE CHIROPRACTORS I CAN SPEAK FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP THAT THEY'RE MORE THAN WILLING. TO PARTNER UP AND TO YOUR POINT DR WOULD OF DEPARTMENTS WORKING IN SILOS I THINK ALL OF THAT A LOT OF THE PROVIDERS AND ALL THESE PROFESSIONS ARE WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER. AND WE REALLY HOPE THAT A WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT PREVENTION. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF LCI KIT CALIFORNIA STANDARDS ENFORCEABLE STANDARDS WHO PROVIDES TREATMENT. AND WHO DOESN'T THERE IS NO LICENSE YOU KNOW THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF CARE IS THAT AFTER CARE OUTPATIENT. VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU HAD A LICENSE AND AND SOMETHING YOU CAN ACTUALLY ENFORCE AGAINST PEOPLE YOU GET RID OF ALL THE PROBLEMS YOU HAVE AN ORANGE COUNTY. IS IT ISN'T A SOBER LIVING HOMES OF THE PEOPLE TAKING THE MONEY AND GIVING ITS THE SOBER LIVING HOMES WITH NO STANDARD. YOU GET RID OF THE WHOLE THING WHERE DIANA DULY GOT CHASED AROUND BIKE ANDERSON COOPER FOR LA COUNTY PROVIDING THANK SERVICES. SO THAT'S PART OF IT IN IN THE STANDARD SUITE WE HAVE A SIMPLE BILL LAST YEAR THAT PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR VETOED. WE AT THE HE HAS SOME SOMEONE WHO WORKS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. IT SETS STANDARDS JUST FOR KIDS IS FOR KIDS TREATMENT. CAN'T WE AT LEAST DO THAT SO I THINK I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT WE NEED TO ENFORCEABLE STANDARDS. WE NEED THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE RESPONSIBLE DEPARTMENTS TO STOP ABDICATING RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S PARTLY WHAT WHAT T. C. A. P. P. JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT ABOUT. INDIVIDUALS PROVIDING SERVICES SHOULD BE LICENSE AND EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE STANDARDS THEY HAVE TO MEET AND TELL YOU DO THAT. SOME LETTER TO ANYBODY DOESN'T DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND IT'S NOT ENFORCEABLE AND THEY DON'T WANT AND FORCES. SO I THINK THAT'S THE BASIC THING WE WERE SCIENCE. ON BEHALF OF SEE SAM WAS ALSO MY CLIENT. THE REASON DOCTOR CON COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY AND DOCTOR STUCK TOOK HIS PLACE BECAUSE HE WAS JUST BECAUSE I KNOW THE SERVING ON A HEARING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN. AND HE WAS DOING A PRESENTATION TO PARTNERSHIP SO SO WE'RE WE'RE ON THAT WE REALIZE SITE. NEED HELP AND WE'RE WORKING THANK YOU MUCH.
