WILL BY THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.267

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:07.009
KNOW IT'S A PART OF A OF A OF A

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.411

KOMPLEKS FIRE IN LAKE COUNTY NOW

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:29.832

INTERPRETATION.

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.468

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:51.320
JUST DON'T SEE.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.055
THE NECESSITY FOR THIS BILL

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:54.790
