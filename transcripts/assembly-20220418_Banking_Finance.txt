ON NOT ON DECK YOUR UP AT THE BASE THANK YOU MISS ROGER- AND COLLEAGUES AND I WANNA START BY THINKING THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEES CONSULTANT- FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT AND SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WHICH I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS WOULD ONE PROVIDE THAT IF THERE IS A DEFAULT TIP AMOUNT THAT MUST THAT TOOK HIM OUT MUST BE ZERO THE ONLY DEFAULT YOU CAN HAVE A ZERO. ENSURE THAT TIPS ARE REFUNDABLE AND INFORM CONSUMERS THAT ANY TIP IS VOLUNTARY AND REFUNDABLE SO THERE SHOULD BE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THAT NEARLY A DECADE AGO CALIFORNIA ENACTED FINANCIAL SECTOR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO SAFEGUARD RESIDENTS RECEIVING PUBLICLY ADMINISTERED FUNDS AT THE TIME SOME INSTITUTIONS WERE CHARGING FEES AND PENALTIES THE VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS LOOKING TO ACCESS THEIR FUNDS SO THE ENACTED BILLS PUT IN PLACE CRITERIA FOR WHAT ACCOUNTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE DIRECT DEPOSIT OF PUBLIC FUNDS. LAST YEAR MY FRIEND AND FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR RAMON AUTHORED AN UPDATE TO THE LAW IN RESPONSE TO NON BANK ENTITIES OFFERING ACCOUNTS THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS LEVIED EXCESSIVE OVERDRAFT FEES ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL CRITERIA ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR PROHIBITED CREDIT OR OVERDRAFT FEATURES THAT ALLOW FOR A VOLUNTARY FEE CHARGE OR COST ESSENTIALLY A VOLUNTARY TIP. THE CHANGES MADE BY S. BEFORE NINETY SEVEN WERE PER WERE APPROPRIATE IN LIGHT OF THE PREDATORY ACTIONS OF SOME FINANCIAL SECTOR ENTITIES BUT THERE ARE ACCOUNTS AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS THAT MEET ALL OF THE CRITERIA OF THIS VALUABLE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW BUT ALLOW FOR VOLUNTARY TIPPING. I JOINED BY A- ON BEHALF OF TIME A CALIFORNIA COMPANY THAT ALLOWS AN ACCOUNT HOLDER TO TAKE THEIR ACCOUNT NEGATIVE WITHOUT INCURRING A FEE MEANING YOU CAN OVERDRAFT ON YOUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT BEING CHARGE FOR THAT OVERDRAFT. WELL THERE IS NO CHARGE FOR THIS ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL OVERDRAFT THE ACCOUNT HOLDER HAS THE ABILITY TO VOLUNTARILY TIP THE NONBANK ENTITY. AS A FORM OF GRATITUDE AND THE DECISION WHETHER TO TIP OR NOT DOES NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE CAN ON THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT. THEN OR IN THE FUTURE. I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE CONTINUE TO BE COMPANIES IN THE SPACE THAT ARE NOT GOOD ACTORS AND THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO AND DOES NOT EIGHT OR SUPPORT THOSE PRACTICES. IT'S ALSO WHY I ONCE AGAIN WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER ENGAGING AND PROPOSING A FRAMEWORK OF RESTRICTIONS THAT WILL ENSURE COMPANIES THAT DO NOT LIVE UP TO HI CONSUMER PROTECTION STANDARDS. ARE KEPT OUT OF THE SPACE- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN TESTIFYING WITH ME IN PERSON IS MIKE BELOW- AND BY PHONE IS NEXT TO A WALL. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIKE BELOW IT ON BEHALF OF CHIME FINANCIAL. I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE YOU KNOW I'VEBEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME AND I WOULD NEVER EVER BE INVOLVED WITH THE BILL. THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR MY FRIENDS IN THE CONSUMER GROUPS. AND WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TIP MODEL HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO COERCION. AND MISLEADING PRACTICES BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT CHIME DOES THAT AND I BELIEVE IT IS. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CLARIFY WHEN TIP PRACTICES ARE RIGHT AND WHEN THEY'RE NOT. I BELIEVE CHIME IS DEMOCRATIZING ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES. ACCORDING TO SELFREPORTED DATA. APPROXIMATELY 60% OF CHIME CUSTOMERS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND 70% OR SO ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THIS IS A FREE SERVICE. AND WE ARE DELIGHTED TO CLARIFY IN ACCORD WITH THE WISHES OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT THERE MAY BE NO DEFAULT OR IF THERE IS THE DEFAULT SHALL BE TWO ZERO. AND THAT THE TIP IS REFUNDABLE IF THE CONSUMER EVER WANTS IT BACK. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET FREE SERVICE FEE FREE FREE FREE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES. WITH A CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY THAT'S DOING IT RIGHT WE COMMIT TO CONTINUING OUR DIALOGUE WITH THIS CONSUMER GROUPS I SPOKE WITH THEM JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT MEAN WHAT MAY WELL AGREE ON BUT WHAT WE DO AGREE ON. IS THAT THE CONSUMER OUGHT TO HAVE FULL DISCLOSURE EXACTLY HOW THE APP WORKS. AND WE COMMIT TO THAT. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VISIBLE OVER YOUR TEST AND MR BERMAN ACIMAN BERMAN YOU SAID YOU HAD ANOTHER WITNESS ON THE PHONE- I BELIEVE HE'S AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ALL RIGHT WITH THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE HEARING ROOM.

AND DEBTS INCURRED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AS THE BILL STANDS TODAY AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY. WHAT IMPACT RECIPIENTS OF TAXPAYER FUNDED UNEMPLOYMENT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS PAYMENTS I'M SORRY AND STATE COLLECTED CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS THERE ARE WAYS TO ACCOMMODATE ACCESS.

STATE DEMOCRATS THE GROWING NUMBER OF BANKS THAT HAVE ELIMINATED OVERDRAFT AND NON SUFFICIENT FUNDS FEES THE TWENTY OR MORE BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS IN CALIFORNIA THE OFFER BANK ON CERTIFIED ACCOUNTS. AND PREPAID CARDS AND BANKING OUT TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW. THE BILL CREATES A LOOPHOLE THAT WAS CLOSE LAST YEAR WITH THE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT OF S. B. FOUR NINETY SEVEN AND IT ALSO DIMINISHES THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF LAWS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN. SIMPLY STATED PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE GOVERNMENT BENEFITS NEED EVERY PENNY AND NO ONE WHO IS SEEKING AN ACCOUNT WITHOUT OVERDRAFT FEES RECEIVED THEIR GOVERNMENT BENEFITS. SHOULD BE PUSHED TO PAY THOSE FEES EVEN IF IT'S CONSIDER VOLUNTARY.

A LOT OF QUESTION I YOU KNOW WHAT AND I WAS TRYING I WASN'T GOING TO TURN THAT DOWN I WAS I WAS I WAS REALLY TRYING TO HELP YOU MY WAY I APPRECIATE- THE HOWEVER NOTED THAT YOU ARE NOW AND THE LINES TO. THE HOT SEAT- WITH THAT SAID ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRI. WOULD YOU BE SO KIND JUST GO AHEAD AND ASK YOUR VERY KIND QUESTION YES YES VERY NINE QUESTING Q. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AT THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. I SO. I THINK IN YOUR SIDE THE OPEN AND ADMISSIBILITY. OPENING REMARKS I'M YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TECH MODEL IS SUBJECT TO COURT CORES AND YOU SAID. BUT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING AT CHINA. WHETHER IT IS OR ISN'T I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT BUT I THINK THAT. EVEN YOU SEEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS. IT'S AN ISSUE WITH THE TYPICAL MODELS TO WHAT SAFEGUARDS EXIST IN THIS BILL. TO ENSURE THAT THIS. DOES NOT PEN UP THE DOOR FOR COERCION FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AS A FAIR QUESTION I THINK I HAVE SEEN AND I'M NOT A HUGELY TECHNOLOGICAL PERSON I ADMIT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO. FUSE THE CHIME APP KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT I HAVE SEEN. FINTECH MODELS WHICH HAVE A VARIETY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL COERCION INVOLVED LIKE A LITTLE PERSON WILL GET MORE HAPPY AS YOU TIP. CURRENTLY IT WILL THROTTLE DOWN THE SERVICE OR GIVE YOU MORE SERVICE LATER IF THERE IS A HISTORY OF TIPPING SELL THIS ESTABLISHES THAT YOU MAY NOT IN ANY WAY ENHANCE THEIR PERFORMANCE OR THE SERVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO TIP OR DEGRADE IT FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T. IT HAPPENS THAT THE DECISION TO TIP IS AFTER YOU'VE RECEIVED THE SERVICE AND THE SPOT ME SERVICE- IT HAS TO DEFAULT TO ZERO IF THERE'S ANY DEFAULT AT ALL IN CHINA HAS NO DEFAULT- IT HAS TO BE REFUNDABLE IF YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK YOU CAN HAVE YOUR MONEY BACK. THE ONE THING I DISAGREE RESPECTFULLY WITH THE OPPOSITION IS THEY TOLD ME THAT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO DEFINE VOLUNTARY AND I THINK WE DO. WE DEFINE DIFFICULT TERMS ALL THE TIME. IN HIS BODY AND TO ME THOSE ARE INDEED CHAU VOLUNTARINESS AND IF THERE'S SOME OTHER THAT WE CAN CONSIDER. HAPPY TO DO IT AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP. ON A MEMBER BE GENEROUS AMOUNT OF YOU. HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THIS- SCREENSHOT. OVERTIME IT'S AS IF YOU LEAVE A TIP FOR SPOT ME WE SPOTTED YOU TWENTY DOLLARS WITHOUT FEES AND THEN THERE FOR BOXES 5% AND THE TIP 10% 215% TIP NO TIP ALL ALL CLEARLY. LABELLED AND THEN IT SAYS WHETHER YOU TIP OR NOT HAS NO IMPACT ON YOUR SPOT ME ELIGIBILITY OR LIMITS- SO YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A CLEAR WAY WHERE. YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING SOMEBODY INTO TIPPING YOU'RE NOT TRICKING SOMEBODY INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY HAVE TO TIP FOR IT TO CONTINUE RECEIVING THE SERVICE. AND WE I AM MORE THAN OPEN TO OTHER IDEAS THAT THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR IN THE BILL. THE KIND OF STEPS THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO- DID IT TO HAVE A TIPPING OPTION OR OR NOT- BUT YOU. YEAH I MEAN I THINK YOU ALL KNOW ME I'D- I'D RUN CONSUMER PROTECTION BILLS ALL THE TIME ABOUT ANOTHER ONE THIS YEAR- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MY INTENTION AT ALL TO. ALLOW FIRST THAT PEOPLE. INTO PAYING SOMETHING- THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO- BUT THIS IS A WAY O. PROVIDE THEM AN OPTION- YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE RECEIVING AT THE FEET. A SERVICE WITHOUT A FEE AND A SERVICE THAT IF THEY WRITE A TRADITIONAL BANKING INSTITUTION WOULD PROBABLY AND INVOLVE A HEFTY OVERDRAFT FEE. AND I CERTAINLY AND I THINK THE OPPOSITION AND IT I THINK. IT KNOWLEDGE AND THE YOUR INTENT AND SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS ABOUT THAT ANYONE'S CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR INTENT OR- IF ANYONE QUESTIONING YOUR YOUR RECORD AS A- CONSUMER ADVOCATE AND- YEAH. OF COURSE YES. BUT I THINK WITH SO MANY THINGS THAT WE DO THERE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND I THINK THAT WOULD. THAT'S MY- QUESTION AND AS I SAID IT'S IN I'M STILL TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND- YEAH MY PERSPECTIVE ON TO BEING PARTICULARLY. WITH THIS KIND OF A MARKET SO I THINK AGAIN IN YOUR- IN YOUR OPENING YOU SAID THAT. AT 70% OF YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THESE ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SADLY. THEY ARE SOME OF THE LEAST FINANCIALLY SAVVY CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHY. THEY ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO COERCION EXPLOITATION AND FRANKLY JUST BEING CONFUSED AS TO LIKE WAIT TO I REALLY GET THIS THING AGAIN IF I DON'T KEPT THEM SO. I THINK THAT'S KIND OF THE ROOT OF MY- CONCERNS NOT ABOUT THIS COMPANY SPECIFICALLY BUT THE FACT IT. DOES THIS THEN. OPEN THE DOOR TO BAT PREDATORY LENDERS WHEN YOU KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THOSE FOLKS EXCESS. I'M TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE MADE HERE. TO AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE OPPOSITION FOLKS SAID THAT IT YEAH UNDERCUTS THE LAWS THAT ARE INTENDED TO CAP INTEREST RATES AND PROTECT. CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SO. I'M I GUESS COULD YOU COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT CONCERN AND THEN. I WOULD ALSO LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION I KNOW THE OTHER JUST SAID YOU'RE OPEN TO IDEAS IN TERMS OF SOME SPECIFIC. PROTECTIONS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD MAKE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE. WITH. A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS. THROUGH THE CHAIR PLUS. SO IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THE- RIRE TO THE EXERCISE OF THE TIP YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS DISCLOSURE THAT THIS HAS NO BEARING ON YOUR SERVICE SO WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS WE POSSIBLY CAN AND IF THERE'S WAYS TO MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR BUT THAT'S PART OF THE- COMMITTEE AMENDMENT I AM TOLD THAT ROUGHLY 20% OF. CHIME CUSTOMERS THAT UTILIZE SPOTTY TIP SO 80% DON'T IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME I'VE AND I'VE LOOKED AT THE WORK FLOW HERE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO GIVE IT TO YOU IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT TO GET THE SERVICE AND SO IF THERE ARE WAYS TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR OR MORE DISCLOSURE WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT- WE THINK THAT WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY KIND OF DEMOCRATIZING FINANCIAL ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES HERE IT'S A- IT'S A GOOD SYSTEM YOU KNOW YOU ALLUDED TO THAT TO THE FACT THAT 7% OF TIME CUSTOMERS ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND- I THINK THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO CHIME AND THEIR ABILITY TO BANK. THE UNBANKED- AND TO CREATE A SERVICE- FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T THAT WHERE THERE'S NO RISK OF FEES- RIGHT WITH NO RISK OF OVERDRAFT FEES- THAT TRADITIONAL BANKS HAVE AND SO YOU KNOW THEY'VE CREATED A MODEL. THAT'S ALLOWED A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T USUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL BANKING OPTIONS THEY CREATED A NEW OPTION FOR THEM WITHOUT THE FEES THAT THE TRADITIONAL BANKING OPTIONS HANNAH- WHICH I THINK IS A- IS IT. PRETTY ADMIRABLE THING. BONTA ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOUCHING NORTH OF QUESTION. ARE YOU MAY. THIS IS LAWRENCE WITH NATIONAL LAW CENTER I'M SO EVEN WITHIN. IT STILL IS TO THINK BETWEEN BY CHARGES AND CHARGES THAT ARE NOT MILITARY IDEA P. I. JUST REJECT A CHAR IS NOT THAT IS. AND THE NO IN THE LAW FOR THE LOG IN THE RULES GOVERNING BEANS AND INTEREST AND THAT IS ACTUALLY LONG FAN CAL LAW THAT THERE IS NO VOLUNTARY. TO THE USER IN NOT. WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS. D. YOU KNOW THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AS- OR COULD. OF THE CAR OR OVER. FEES BY COUNTY. WITHIN THE BUT THE A LOT OF THE WAYS THAT COME. CAN COERCE TIPS AND ADVICE THE DAY I DISCOVERED DEEP IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANOTHER COMPANY THAT SAYS IT DOES NOT DIMINISH YOU KNOW MAKE ANY YEAH IT CHANGES IF YOU DON'T TO. DEEPEN THE TERMS OF THE CONDITIONS THERE'S A WAYS WHERE THEY LIKE TURN OFF THE ALERTS THAT YOU WANT AND MAKE THE APP LESS FUNCTIONAL IF YOU DON'T GET THAT. SO THERE IS AN NUMBER OF WAYS THAT COMPANIES CAN DO THINGS THAT WE JUST CAN'T WRITE INTO THE LAW. BY DRYNESS BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT IS NOT PART OF CALIFORNIA ON THAT UNDERMINE THE FBI'S. A RECENT. OPINION THANK YOU FOR THAT N. ASSEMBLY. PETRIE-NORRIS YOU HAVE ANY OTHER THIS BILL IS THEN THE VOLUNTARY TIPS X. FROM THAT INTEREST CALCULATION OR WOULD IT BE INCLUDED AND SUBJECT TO THE INTEREST RATE CAPS THAT WILL OF. IMPLEMENTED THAT QUESTION HAS IN EVERY DEPARTMENT SYMBOLIC EXCUSE ME MR BELOW IF YOU YEAH AND I DON'T THERE IS NO INTEREST ON THE OVERDRAFT FEATURE. SO RIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD MAKE AN A. P. R. DISCLOSURE FOR EXAMPLE- YOU ARE NOT IT'S NOT ALSO I JUST ASSUME THAT YOU ALSO HAD A LENDING PRODUCT AS A SEAT BELT WITH IT IT'S JUST- THIS THIS JUST LOSING OVER DROUGHT ONLY TO THE OVERTURE YES ALL RIGHT SO THERE'S NEVER THERE'S NO INTEREST THAT SORT OF INTEREST. OF GOT OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CHARGER GODDESS FAR AS WHETHER TO ALLOW THEM TO TIP OR NOT. YES DR CHOI. I AM LOOKING AT PM. SUPPORTS AND THE WHAT IS IT IS TO ABOUT TWELVE WHAT IT FOR THE- IT FOR THIS NAY TRUE IF CONSUMER. WHY ARE THERE ARE SOME. OF ENTITIES NO I AM NOT LET ME SAY I LOVE A LOT OF THE GROUPS THAT ARE OPPOSED TO MY BILL- AND THAT'S AND THAT'S A THAT'S AN AWKWARD THING- YOU WE HAVE DISAGREEMENTS I GUESS ON ON YOU KNOW THE IMPACT THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN WE HAVE DISAGREEMENTS ON YOU KNOW I THINK THAT- YES. THAT WHETHER OR NOT. PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A VOLUNTARY OPTION TO TIP FOR SOMETHING WHEN THEY RECEIVE A SERVICE WITH NO FEES AND I THINK IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT ON THAT. RIGHT BUT I SHOULDN'T SPEAK FOR THE OPPOSITION SO I HAPPILY NO AND I AND I. PARDON ME MAY SPEAK BRIEFLY I DO WANT TO DRAW THE DISTINCTION THAT I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION AND JUST TO ECHO. THE AUTHOR'S STATEMENT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WORKS RACKLEY WITH HIS OFFICE AND DO YOU KNOW HIM TO BE. A GOOD SUPPORTER OF LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BUT IN THIS CASE. THERE'S STILL CONTINUE TO BE LOOPHOLES THAT WE SEE- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITIES. WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A LANGUAGE ISSUE THERE MIGHT BE YOU KNOW SOME COMPREHENSION THERE IS DURESS THERE'S YOU KNOW THE STRESS THAT COMES WITH AN ECONOMIC. ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE OF AND WE JUST THINK THAT. THERE'S MORE ROOM FOR CONVERSATION. I THINK WE ARE VERY OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'VE HEARD THAT POSSIBLE TIMES NOW ABOUT- YOUR OPENNESS. AND THEIR REQUEST. FOR MORE- YES SAYS MEMBER MARC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO ECHO THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUE. FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND SAY YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU TO BE A MEMBER WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND- MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL LIES IN EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR THE OPPOSITION WHICH IS THAT IT IS THOSE THAT ARE BEING. SUBJECT TO OVERDRAFT WHO ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BEING ASKED TO TAP RIGHT WHICH IS OUR MOST VULNERABLE CONSUMERS. AND I THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE CREATING A LOOPHOLE IN A BILL THAT I BELIEVE I HEARD WAS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE- THERE REALLY PROTECTED CONSUMERS. WHO ARE GETTING YOU KNOW ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE BECAUSE THEY NEED IT AND NOW WE'RE TAKING THAT ASSISTANCE IN ASKING THEM TO TAP OF FOR PROFIT COMPANY THAT GIVES ME PAUSE THAT'S NOT MY INTENT WHEN I. ASK TO GIVE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED I DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN TO STAND UP AT THE TECH COMPANIES. AND SO YOU KNOW I JUST I'M GONNA GO FOR THE OAKS I TRUST YOU I TRUST YOU TO GET THIS BILL TO A PLACE WHERE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED PERHAPS WE COULD EXEMPT. YOU KNOW FEES FOR ANYONE USING THE APP WHO IS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE RATES OVERALL NOT ASSISTANCE USERS YOU CONTEST BUT MAYBE IF YOU'RE ON ASSISTANCE THAT IS NOT SOMEBODY WE CAN AFTER TECH BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE TAKING THOSE DOLLARS. AND GIVING THEM TO TECH COMPANIES- BUT I TRUST YOU TO DO THAT WORK BUT I REALLY DO HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND THINK MORE WORK IS NEEDED I TRUST YOU DO THAT TO THANK MR BERMAN I APPRECIATE THAT AND YOU KNOW WORK BLACK OF TALK ABOUT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND I KNOW- THE- OPPONENT. CALLING FROM THE PHONE MENTIONED THE CONCERNS DIGGING IN THE TERMS OF USE OF A OF A DIFFERENT COMPANY AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW YOU COULD THROTTLE SERVICES O ON AND AFTER THAT YOU KNOW WILL WILL PUT THAT IN THE BILL THAT YOU BECAUSE I THINK IT'S MEANT TO BE IT MIGHT ALREADY BE IN THE BILL THAT YOU CANNOT. PRODUCE SERVICES IF YOU DECLINE THE OPTION TO TIP. THAT'S NOT AND SO WE WILL MAKE THAT A- AIR TIGHTNESS OF- TO IT TO. MAKE FOLKS COMFORTABLE WITH THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE I USED TO WRITE TERMS OF USE- BACK IN MY IT LAWYER DAYS AND I KNOW HOW LONG THEYGET AND I KNOW THAT NOBODY READS THEM- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN'T. YOU KNOW PUT ANYTHING TRICKY IN THERE TO GET AROUND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. SO I. YEAH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. IN MR BERMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU TO YOU YOUR STAFF. AND ALSO TO THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL AS WELL AS THE COMMENTS THAT YOU AND QUESTIONS YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY WHICH I BELIEVE ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT- AS INPUT FOR YOU MOVING FORWARD AS WELL AS THE VOICE OF OPPOSITION. IN MAKING SURE THAT WE DO ADDRESS ANY LOOPHOLES AND ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT OPPOSITION HAS THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WILL MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE CONSUMER THAT THE TIP IS TRULY VOLUNTARY. THIS WILL ALSO HELP PROVIDE CRUCIAL SAFEGUARDS AND ENSURE CONSUMERS CAN ACCESS AND AFFORDABLE DIRECT DEPOSIT OPTION SO I REALLY DO SHARE THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE USE OF VOLUNTARY TIPS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT I HAVE LEARNED A LOT- REALLY HAVE ABOUT ALL THE WAYS THAT POLITICS CAN BE MISUSED AS WAS STATED- IN TESTIMONY HOWEVER I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T BECAUSE UNNECESSARY DISRUPTION. FOR CALIFORNIANS AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AN OTHERWISE AFFORDABLE OPTION OFF OF THE TABLE AND FOR THAT REASON THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ADD GUARD RAILS FOR THESE TYPES OF ACCOUNTS. AND WITH THAT DO I HAVE AND I'M A MOTION AND A SECOND. SO I DO HAVE A MOTION FROM VICE CHAIR CHEN AND THE SECOND FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER CERVANTES WITH THAT. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THIS MODEL IS NOT ONLY GOOD FOR WORKERS BUT ALSO HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE MORE ABLE TO WEATHER ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS THAN TRADITIONALLY INCORPORATED BUSINESSES- THIS RESILIENCE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT WORKER OWNERS. ARE MORE IN TUNE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE ON THE GROUND ALLOWING THEM TO PIVOT QUICKLY- AND LEADING TO FEWER LAYOFFS- STATE INVESTMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE HYBRID MODEL WOULD BE OF GREAT PUBLIC BENEFIT PAVING THE WAY FOR MORE CALIFORNIANS TO REACH ECONOMIC PROSPERITY- I'LL I'LL PASS MY TIME TO KIRK MARTIN GENERAL MANAGER AND- AND FOUNDER.

AUGMENT MY NOTES ARE- I'M HERE PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY WHICH AIMS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS FROM PREDATORY LOANS. ANY OF THESE LOANS ARE PREDATORY IN NATURE AND WITH HIDDEN FEES AND EXORBITANTLY HIGH INTEREST RATES SOMETIMES OVER AND ABOVE A HUNDRED PERCENT. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY WOULD PROHIBIT A CALIFORNIA FINANCING LAW LICENSEE FOR MAKING CONSUMER LOAN FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING A DOG OR A CAT IF THAT LOAN IS OFFERED ARRANGED. OR FACILITATED BY MERGING A RETAILER WITH ME TODAY AND SUPPORT IS HAGUE WITH THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND. THANK YOU. THIS HEY YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU CARE AND NUMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER HAGUE WITH THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND AND WE ARE PROUD TO BE THE SPONSOR AT TWENTY THREE EIGHTY OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE WORKED WITH OUR COALITION PARTNERS AND THE LEGISLATURE TO RESTRICT THE RETAIL SALE OF DOGS AND CATS AND BRICK AND MORTAR STORES ACROSS THE STATE CUTTING OFF THAT CHANNEL OF THE PUPPY MILL PIPELINE. HOWEVER THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT YET ADDRESSED ONLINE SALES WHERE BAD ACTORS CAN STILL OPERATE SOME ONLINE RETAILERS OFFER FINANCING FROM LENDERS THAT KURT CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AND OFFERED BONE BUT THE CORPORATE INTEREST RATES AND HIDDEN FEES SUCH PREDATORY LOANS PROVIDE OUTLETS FOR PUPPY AND KITTEN MILLS TO SELL ANIMAL PER THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO CONSUMERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM. THESE LOANS AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH INTEREST RATES AS HIGH AS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY PERCENT ANNUALLY. ART OF THE ONGOING. INTO THIS ISSUE A OKAY ASKING. WITH AN INDEPENDENT LEGAL INVESTIGATORS TO ATTEMPT TO PURCHASE A COPY THROUGH ELEVEN ONLINE RETAILER SUSPECTED OF OFFERING THESE PREDATORY FINANCING OPTIONS. IN MOST INSTANCES THE INVESTIGATING FIRM WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY SECURE A CONTRACTOR FINANCING USING A CALIFORNIA ADDRESS. IN AS LITTLE AS TEN MINUTES. ONE SUCH CONTRACT CAME WITH A SEVENTY THREE POINT 7% INTEREST RATE. AND TURNED A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN INTO MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN TOTAL COST. THE EXHIBIT INTEREST RATES AND FEES OF THESE MONTHS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE SIMPLY LOOKING TO BRING A PET INTO THEIR LIVES. CAN RESULT IN FINANCIAL INSTABILITY FOR THE BUYERS AND BY EXTENSION CAN HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PET BEING PURCHASED. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX TO HELP PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING BY PROHIBITING RETAILERS FROM KEEP ENGAGING IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH LENDERS. AND THE SOLIDITY ACCESS TO BE PUT PREDATORY LOANS. LDF RECOGNIZES THE COMPLEXITY OF REGULATING THIS ISSUE AND IT KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THIS IS ONE COMPONENT OF THE LARGER NATIONAL CONVERSATION SURROUNDING RENTAL BANKS. WE THANK THE AUTHOR COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAFF AT THE FBI FOR THEIR TIME ENGAGING IN CONVERSATION BUT HELPING TO STRENGTHEN OUR ORIGINAL PROPOSAL. AFTER I VOTE AS WE SEEK TO MAKE THIS GREAT STEP TOWARD GREATER PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND MARK FINANCIALLY STABLE HOMES FOR PETS.

SINGING HEARING NINE MODERATE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU MODERATOR OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DR CHOI. YEAH A THINK I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND- INTENT BUT I WAS WONDERING IF I THIS BILL IDEA WAS SO PROMPTED BY YOU OR EXPERIENCE OR SOMEBODY YOU KNOW ABA ON. MMHM WHAT THE PROMPTED YOU TO COME UP WITH THIS BILL JUST MIGHT WORK IN THIS AREA OVER BOTH MY YEARS ON THAT SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL AND THEN AS AN ASSEMBLY MANY ANYONE THOUGH WHO BORROWED THE MONEY. AND THE PETS WERE MISTREATED. ANY PARTICULAR LIKE A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL THAT CONTACTED ME NOW. OKAY I'M IN THE PAPER WITH THE NO FINANCIAL ABILITY AND THE MAKING ALONE- HAS A POTENTIAL- BUT- I WAS SO CURIOUS ABOUT IT THE WHAT IF FIVE FOR SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW AFTER KNOWING. THAT THEY CANNOT. MCALOON FOR PURCHASING. THE OPRAH CAT SAID THEY CAN LIVE ISSUED RIGHT AND THAT THEY THEY BY. HOW JOURNAL IS SOME I DON'T KNOW IF I UNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION THERE WERE WHAT'S YOUR DATA IF YOU WANT TO MODERATE ICE IF A CONSUMER LIES. WHAT THE LOAN WAS- A- ARE NOT INTENDED FOR ADULT WHAT CATS. OKAY SO WHAT'S YOU YOU MAY ADDRESS AT A NEW CLOSING IF YOU WOULD WAY I'M I'M SURE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION SO. IF A CONSUMER LIES. YEAH IN MAKING A LOAN APPLICATION THE INTENT OF THE BILL. THE AFTER KNOWING THAT THAT THIS IS A LEGAL. YEAH MISTER CHAIR AWESOME BUT STILL WITH THE STRATEGIES ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND AS WELL AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING OVER TWENTY A POINT HERE THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO GET INTO THE- NITTY GRITTY DETAILS AS TO WHY LENDERS MAKING THIS- IF YOU'RE ON A- WEBSITE TO PURCHASE A CAT OR A DOG PRETTY OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO FINANCING THAT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THAT FINANCING- IF YOU WERE TO GO TO SAY A LOCAL BRICK AND MORTAR BANK OF AMERICA OR A- YOU KNOW WHATEVER YOUR BANKING INSTITUTION IS- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ASK IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE AND SO THERE'S NOT A NECESSARILY THAT SAME LEVEL OF- HAVING GAUGE MINT- WHICH I THINK IS GETTING TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE ASKING THERE. ARE MAYBE IF YOUR OTHER POINT IS THAT. IT'S IF SOMEBODY LIES THERE IS THERE IS. IF YOU LIVE ON DOCUMENT THERE'S THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO FOR LINE ON ONE DOCUMENT. SO I MEAN I THINK THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CONSUMER WANTING TO LIE IT WOULD BE THE SAME AS AT THE CONSUMER. LINE ON A MORTGAGE DOCUMENT WHATEVER ELSE THERE'S REMEDIES THAT. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR ATTEMPTING TO BREAK THE LAW DO SOMETHING DISHONEST IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING I'M AGAIN I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW THE% DETAILS ABOUT WHAT AT THIS BILL WILL DO BUT THEY SENT. THE THAT WHEN. WHEN CONSUMER- MAKES A LOAN. TO PURCHASE A PATH THAT THE PETS ARE NOT GONNA BE COLLATERAL. WHEN YOU BUY A HOUSE. THE HOUSE IS A COLLATERAL SO WE NORTH AND THEN THE EXACTLY KNOWLES. SO THAT'S WHY. HOW HOW IS E IT WOULD HOW ABOUT DOCTOR CHOI IF I MAY I THINK WITH THE BILL ADDRESSES IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A LENDER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND THE RETAILER. OF THE OF THE PET. AND SO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT. THERE CAN'T BE THIS RELATIONSHIP OF A RETAILER SOLELY GIVING LOANS OUT. AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE OF A PET IS THAT. HOW I UNDERSTAND THE BILL TO. CORRECT OKAY SO YOU COULD STILL GO TO YOUR PERSONAL FROM THE WRIST RETAILERS YES SO YOU COULD STILL GO TO YOUR BANK AND PULL OUT A LOAN. AND GO SKINNER WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SPEND IT ON. AND I DON'T WANNA SPEAK ON NOW THAT'S THERE THAT I THINK THAT'S- SPOT ON ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR YEAH. BUT I KNOW THAT E HAVE TO OTHER MEMBERS AT QUESTIONS DR TROY DO YOU HAVE. ANY OTHER QUESTION. OR CONCERN I'M IN INTENT IS GOOD BUT THE AYE HE- ASKED THE FIRST QUESTION WHETHER THERE WAS ANY. EXAMPLES. OF- YOU KNOW. MISTREATING OF ANY SAYS JUST BE USE THAT YOU DIDN'T HEAR SEE I DON'T KNOW THERE WOULD. SOME THAT THIS LOAN WOULD. IN ANIMAL ABUSE I'M I'M NOT MAKING THAT CONNECTION. SO THAT IS A QUESTION WHAT WHAT THIS ORDER. THIS BILL OR SOFTWARE YOU KNOW SO TRYING TO SOLVE THE- PROBLEM THAT EXISTED IT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP SOLVE YOU ESSENTIAL USER YES LOANS IN IN THE INSTANCE OF BUYING A PAT. FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE'S LIKE POINT OF SALE PRESSURE. IF YOU KNOW I WILL SPEAK FOR HIM MYSELF WITH MY DAUGHTERS YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER'S WOULD. LEAD ME TO GET THAT PUPPY EVEN IF THE INTEREST RATE WAS A HUNDRED PERCENT. THEY BE ALL FOR THAT. YOU KNOW SO NOW WOULD THAT BE A GOOD THING TO DO I WOULD SAY FOR MOST PEOPLE A 100% INTEREST FOR A LOAN. IS A REALLY BAD THING TO DO SO IT'S TO SORT OF THOSE SITUATIONS EXIST WHERE YOU HAVE A CUTE PUPPY AND- YOU KNOW TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS IT MAY BE REALLY WANT THAT YOUNG PUPPY SO THAT WOULD BE. I THINK- A SUITABLE EXAMPLE FOR YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR CAMP I'LL BE VERY THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND I THINK HE'S REALLY GETTING AT SOMETHING IMPORTANT WITH HIS COMMENTS AROUND PREDATORY LENDING IN THIS SPACE BUT I WANTED TO. RESPOND TO SOMETHING THAT I HEARD THE SUPPORT SAY IN THEIR COMMENTS WHICH IS- THAT PERHAPS THESE ARE NOT HOMES THAT PETS SHOULD BE AND I WANT TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THE BREAK THAT ANIMALS BRING JOY TO FAMILIES ACROSS THE FINANCIAL SPECTRUM AND I THINK YOU AND I ARE BOTH HUGE SUPPORTERS OF ADOPTION AND I THINK IT'S A BETTER OPTION AND THAT'S WHY SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I FOUND THAT ACKERMAN ACTUALLY VERY OFFENSIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THOSE COMMENTS ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING THEN WE WILL TURN TO THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSE.

A LOT OF OPEN. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR THE PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE OF ADDRESSING THE COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AMENDING CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE THREE OH ONE POINT FOR THE UNDERLYING STATUTE AB NINE SEVEN NINE HAS RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION RECENTLY HAVING BEEN DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT QUOTE BECAUSE THE STATUTE TREATS THE SIMILARLY SITUATED INDIVIDUALS DIFFERENTLY BASED ON RACE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY. BECAUSE THE USE UP SUSPECT CATEGORIES IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY ANY COMPELLING STATE INTEREST. AND BECAUSE THE STATUES NOT NARROWLY TAILORED TO SERVE THE INTERESTS OFFERED THE STATUTE VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE STATUTES RULING WAS DRIVEN BY THE RECORD PRESENTED ANY IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS INSTANCES WHERE THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE SECRETARY'S POSITION. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A COMPELLING INTEREST IN PROMOTING DIVERSITY AND REMEDIATING DISCRIMINATION BY CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS WHEN SELECTING MEMBERS OF THE BOARD. SORT OF THE OPINION LEAVE US. FIRST WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT THE COURT DID NOT RULE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN NINE SEVEN NINE SURVIVE A CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE RATHER THE OPINION TELLS US WE NEED TO DO MORE HOMEWORK. THAT WE WANT TO PROVE THAT TE STATUTE DOES NOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION YOU MUST DEVELOP AND PRESENT STRONGER EVIDENCE. FOR EXAMPLE. EVIDENCE UST BE PRESENTED WHICH INFORMS THE COURT OF THE IDENTITY OF THE REGULATED COMPANIES. STRONGER EVIDENCE MUST BE PRESENTED WHICH DEMONSTRATES THAT THE BOARD SELECTION PROCESS IS DISCRIMINATORY AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED OR ATTEMPTED OTHER INTERMEDIATE AND RACE NEUTRAL MEASURES TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL FOR DIVERSITY. AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL EVIDENCE MUST BE PRESENTED WHICH JUSTIFIES PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR EACH GROUP IDENTIFIED IN THE STATUTE INCLUDING THE ADDITIONAL GROUPS PROPOSED IN THE AMENDMENT AND PRESENTED THE BILL SHOULD PASS MUSTER AND NOT BE FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE. AND IDEA- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THOSE TALKS WILL BE PLEASED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ANYONE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT TESTIMONY.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COUNTY PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M STILL AT HOW DID YOU DETERMINE THE BLESSED FIVE- AT THAT UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES THAT YOU'VE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL- WHAT WAS THE METHODOLOGY FOR THAT AND WHAT OTHER GROUPS WERE CONSIDERED AN PERHAPS NOT INCLUDED. SO- RESEARCHERS AT CORNELL IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOUND THAT ONLY 10% OF THESE BOARDS THAT ARE TARGETED OF OUR NON WHITE. AND SO A LOT OF TIMES THERE ARE CONSTITUENCIES THAT ARE IMMIGRANT BASED COMMUNITIES WHO DON'T HAVE OPPORTUNITIES- TO ADVANCE AND- BASED ON THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN THEY MIGHT NECESSARILY NOT- RECEIVE A CERTAIN- WHO STEP BUT DO END UP PAYING THE PRICE- AND YOU'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN. IN FRESNO YOU'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN LA AREA OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS YOU'VE SEEN VARIOUSDIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY MIDDLE EASTERN COMMUNITIES END UP BEING TARGETED AND HOUSE THESE COVENANTS- AND VARIOUS OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATORY. ACTS AND SO THIS WAS A WAY OF. EXPANDING THE DEFINITION MILDLY TO ALLOW FOR A VERY SMALL SEGMENT OF COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO BE INCLUDED- SO THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM. THEIR SIDE WERE THERE ANY GROUPS THAT YOU LOOKED AT INCLUDING AND THEN DECIDED NOT TO. BUT NOT NECESSARILY UP HAPPY TO. WORK WITH YOUR SUGGESTIONS I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO MOMENT I JUST WAS CURIOUS TO. UNDERSTAND HOW YOU WOULD ARRIVE NOT REAL AT THAT POINT OKAY NOT REALLY IT WAS IT WAS TO TARGET TO COMPETE GROUPS THAT HAVE JUST FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS.

B. 23-14 THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE AMENDMENTS ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS WHEN YOU ARE READY PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THAT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. I AM HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL 23-14 AND FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH PROTECTIONS FOR BORROWERS PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE TREASURER'S CAL CAP AND I BANKS SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM AB 23-14 BUILDS UPON PAST WORK TO ENSURE THAT TRANSPARENT PRICING AND TERMS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES APPLYING FOR LOANS ARE AVAILABLE TO BUSINESS OWNERS THIS BILL REQUIRES LENDERS LENDERS THAT UTILIZE TAXPAYER MONEY THROUGH CAL CAP AND THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. SHABAD BY SEVERAL IMPORTANT TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS I I'D LIKE TO NOW INTRODUCE MY TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES HEIDI PICKMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR MICRO ENTERPRISE OPPORTUNITY AND MICHAEL RAPAPORT FRIEND AXION OPPORTUNITY FUND. HI THANK YOU CHAIR GRAYSON AND VICE CHAIR CHEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS HEIDI PICKMAN I REPRESENT CAMEO A LITTLE EASIER TO SAY IT'S THE WORST STATEWIDE NETWORK OF OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS. DEDICATED TO FURTHERING MICRO AND SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA. ENRIC ANNUALLY ARE MISSION DRIVEN MEMBERS SERVE ABOUT EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND VERY SMALL BUSINESSES WITH TRAINING BUSINESS AND CREDIT ASSISTANCE AND RESPONSIBLE LOANS. THESE FIRMS SUPPORT- CREATE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND NEW JOBS IN CALIFORNIA GENERATE A TOTAL OF SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. IN THE COMING MONTHS MANY ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WELL HEAD ONLINE TO LOOK FOR CAPITAL TO REBUILD FROM THE OMICRON WAVE OF PANDEMIC OR START A NEW BUSINESS. AND WHILE REPUTABLE REPUTABLE ONLINE LENDERS EXISTS TO OFTEN ONLINE LENDERS OFFER PROMISES OF CAPITAL THAT ARE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. AND- MANY TIMES PREDATORY LOANS THE TRAP ENTREPRENEURS IN A CYCLE OF DEBT. THIS IS ALSO AN EQUITY ISSUE AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE STUDY THAT'S- SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR MORE LIKELY TO GO ONLINE TO FIND FAN I FINANCING THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN OWNER OF AN EAST BAY BURGER JOINT WANTED TO OPEN A SECOND LOCATION BUT COULDN'T GET A TRADITIONAL LOAN FROM HIS BANK. AND HE WENT ONLINE HE WAS GET HE THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING A REGULAR- BUT ENDED UP WITH A PRODUCT THAT WAS TAKING OUT FIVE HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS FROM HIS BANK ACCOUNT. ON A DAILY BASIS AND THAT'S A REAL BIG HIT TO SMALL BUSINESS CASH FLOW. I'M WITH SB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WHICH PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA BECAME A LEADER IN PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESSES. AB TWENTY THREE FOURTEEN WILL FURTHER THAT LEADERSHIP AND WE THINK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR HER LEADERSHIP- BY CODIFYING SEVERAL BEST PRACTICES AND SMALL BUSINESS FUNDING AND ENSURE THE STATE IS NOT SUBSIDIZING BAD BEHAVIOR. THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE'RE HONORED TO SPONSOR THE BILL- MICHAEL RAPAPORT FOR THE TRNSPORTATION. THANK YOU EVERYBODY IN GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS MICHAEL RAPAPORT I'M PRESIDENT CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AT ACTION OPPORTUNITY FUND- WE ARE A LEADING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CDFI. WORKING TO CREATE AN INCLUSIVE HEALTHY FINANCIAL SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS OUR NATION SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WE DO THIS BY CONNECTING ENTREPRENEURS TO AFFORDABLE CAPITAL EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND BUSINESS COACHING. I'M HERE TO SHARE OUR ORGANIZATION SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY MOVING PETRIE-NORRIS HIS BILL. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE ANY COMMERCIAL FINANCING PRODUCTS LEVERAGING STATE FUNDS TO INCLUDE. SEVERAL REALLY IMPORTANT FINANCING RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS FOR BORROWERS. L. F. IS BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN SMALL BUSINESS LENDING FOR. IT SINCE WE BRING. FOUNDED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHERE A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS LENDING COALITION WHICH CREATED THE SMALL BUSINESS BORROWER BILL OF RIGHTS. AND WE HELP PASSED SENATOR GLAZERS S. B. TWENTY TWELVE THIRTY FIVE AT HOW YOU MENTION WHICH IS THE FIRST TRUTH IN LENDING BILL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE ALSO A LEADING SMALL BUSINESS LENDER IN THE STATE'S CAL CAP AND HIGH BANK LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS. IN FACT WE'VE BEEN ONE OF THE TOP THREE CAL CAP LENDERS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE'RE REALLY THRILLED TO SEE THAT THIS BILL WOULD CALL CODIFY RESPONSIBLE LENDING PRACTICES LIKE BANNING THE USE OF CONFESSIONS OF JUDGMENT REQUIRING THE DISCLOSURE PREPAYMENT PENALTIES PART DISPERSAL AND OTHER IMPORTANT MEASURES. UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE ALSO SEEN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TECH CAN GET CAUGHT IN THIS NEVER ENDING. A CYCLE OF DEBT AS A RESULT OF NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING OR KNOWING THE TERMS OF THE LOANS. WE HAVE A CLIENT RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO HER NAME IS DEANNA IRISH. SHE OWNS WINE TOUR DRIVERS SHE TOOK ON A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR ONLINE LOAN WHICH ENDED UP COSTING HER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. BECAUSE OF FEES AND INTEREST THAT WERE WERE REALLY NOT DISCLOSED WELL. LUCKILY WE WERE ABLE TO HELP HER REFINANCE WHICH CUTTER PAYMENTS OF MORE THAN HALF DOWN TO NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. HER STORY DEANNA STORY IS NOT UNCOMMON UNFORTUNATELY SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE ANALYZE MULTIPLE ONLINE FINANCING CONTRACTS THAT CLIENTS OF OURS BROUGHT TO US. AND WE FOUND THAT SOMETIMES AVERAGE APR AS CAN BE A- 94% OR HIGHER AND IN ONE CASE WE SAW A LOAN THAT HAD A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT. APR IF JUST SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS LISTED IN THE- IN THE BILL WERE STANDARD ACROSS THE INDUSTRY THERE WOULD BE FAR FEWER OF THESE. SITUATIONS AB TWENTY THREE FOURTEEN IS ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS ENSURING GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN THE INDUSTRY AND WE ARE GLAD WE BEHIND IT THANK YOU.

THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED THERE'S A SECOND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE MOTION AND SECOND TEAM OVER HERE. I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO- MISTER VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AT AB EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE WHICH REQUIRES AN APARTMENT A FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENT AND ADMINISTER INVOLUNTARY ONLINE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON THE ECONOMIC ABUSE OF VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OCCURS WHEN SOMEONE HARMS A PERSON WITH WHOM THEY CURRENTLY OR PREVIOUSLY SHARED AND EMOTIONALLY OR PHYSICALLY INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP. A LESS VISIBLE AND FAR TOO COMMON FORM OF ABUSE THE SURVIVORS AN INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IS FINANCIAL ABUSE IT CAN TAKE MANY FORMS INCLUDING AN ABUSER REDUCING SAVINGS ACCOUNTS OR ASSETS RESTRICTING ACCESS TO BANK ACCOUNTS AND INCURRING COERCED AND FRAUDULENT DEBT IN FACT FINANCIAL USES ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS VICTIMS AREN'T ABLE TO LEAVE ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS THE FINANCIAL DEVASTATION OF ABUSE MAKES BANKING PRODUCTS ON AFFORDABLE AND SURVIVORS CANNOT SAFELY SAVE MONEY NOR ACCESS FUNDS NECESSARY TO LEAVE. ECONOMIC ABUSE IS WIDESPREAD BUT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE SIMPLY NOT TRAINED ON HOW TO EFFECTIVELY DETECT AND RESPOND TO IT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT SUPPORTED SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND TRAINING TO HELP MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS BUILD ASSETS THEY NEED TO KEEP THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES SAFE AB EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE THE FBI TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH SURVIVORS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A VOLUNTARY TRAINING PROGRAM INTENDED TO AMONG OTHER THINGS IDENTIFY SUSPECTED ECONOMIC ABUSE AND INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO REPORT AND RESPOND TO ECONOMIC ABUSE. BY CREATING THIS TRAINING PROGRAM CALIFORNIA WILL TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO SUPPORT AND UP WITH SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE WITH THAT I WOULDLIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESS FROM SOCAL SABRI A- DIRECTOR OF STATE POLICY NERVOUSLY. FREEFORM THANK YOU HELLO AND GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE AND CHAIR MY NAME IS SABRINA HAM AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF STATE AND POLICY ADVOCACY AT FREE FROM AN ORGANIZATION BASED ON LOS ANGELES WORKING TO CREATE PATHWAYS TO LONG TERM SAFETY. AND FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE R. I. P. V. I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE. 40% OF WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IN THEIR LIFETIME WHICH IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 25% OF WOMEN. IPV SURVIVORS ARE SUBJECTED TO IMMENSE FINANCIAL DEVASTATION RELATED TO THE BEAUCE. INCLUDING JOB LOSS PROTECT LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY HEALTHCARE COSTS DAMAGE PART PROPERTY AND IN PARTICULAR ECONOMIC ABUSE IN FACT 99% OF IPV CASES SURVIVORS ARE ALSO SUBJECTED TO ECONOMIC BE IT COULD BE USE BUDGET WHICH INCLUDES PUTTING SURVIVE ON A STRICT ALLOWANCE PROVIDING SURVIVOR FROM GOING TO WORK INCURRING DEBTS IN A SERVICE NAME WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. AND DEPLETING US FARMERS INCOME AND RESOURCES AND ACCESSING AND CONTROLLING THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS IN FACT 58% OF SURVIVORS AND OUR NETWORK REPORTED THAT A HARM DOER HAS MONITORED ACCESS WITHDRAWN FROM OR OTHERWISE CONTROLLED THEIR BANK ACCOUNT FURTHER BLACK INDIGENOUS AND SURVIVORS OF COLOR ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE SURVIVORS TO REPORT THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO A PROTECTED BANK ACCOUNT WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE ACCOUNT SURVIVORS ARE FORCED TO SAVE AND HIDE US SAVE. MONEY AND DANGEROUS WASTE LIKE HIDING CASH AROUND THE HOUSE. SURVIVORS NEED SAFE AND SECURE OPTIONS. SO THAT THEY CAN SAVE THE MONEY THEY NEED TO STAY SAFE HE'LL AND BEGIN TO RECOVER. ONE SURVIVOR WE WORKED WITHIN OUR NETWORK WAS THE PRIMARY BREADWINNER IN HER RELATIONSHIP BUT YOU HAD NO REAL% ACCESS OR CONTROL OF HER INCOME. HER HARM DOER FORCED HER TO GET A PAPER CHECK RATHER THAN A DIRECT DEPOSIT. AND EVERY PAY DAY HE WENT WITH HER TO THE BANK TO KASUR TRACK AND SAID RIGHT BEHIND HER TO MAKE SURE SHE CASTS EVERY CENT. AND HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY TAKE THE CASH OUT OF HER HAND. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT FRAUD FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION ABUSE FROM HAPPENING TO THE CUSTOMERS. UNFORTUNATELY 64% OF SURVIVORS IN OUR NETWORK. REPORTS EATING RECEIVING NO ARE UNHELPFUL SUPPORT FROM THEIR BANK. WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING CALIFORNIA TO GIVE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

PETRIE-NORRIS PETRIE-NORRIS I STONE STONE I WICKS WILSON WILSON I THAT BILL HAS TEN VOTES. THE BILL US SENATE SAID BILLS OUT THE RESURGENT. THANK YOU. YES. WE WILL NOW WE WILL NOW WOULD GO TO FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. IT IS AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY NINE NOTE THAT THIS BILL IS TESTIMONY ONLY AND WILL AND WE WILL NOT BE TAKING A VOTE THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN GETTING A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT CRYPTOCURRENCY WE RECEIVED CONSTITUENT CALLS FROM THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF FRAUD OR THEFT. BUT WE ALSO GET A LOT OF CALLS FROM THOSE WHO ARE EXCITED ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT FINANCIAL SERVICES I MYSELF HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILLS APPROACH EVEN THOUGH IT IS MEANT TO REALLY PROVIDE LEGAL CLARITY TO PUBLIC AGENCIES AND PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESSES. I THINK WE HAVE A LOT TO WORK ON OR TO DO FIRST BEFORE WE USE THE POWER OF THE STATE TO PROMOTE CRYPTOCURRENCY FOR EVERYDAY USE HOWEVER I DO WANT TO START- THIS THIS I DO WANT TO START THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE LAST TIME THIS COMMITTEE HEARS ABOUT CRYPTOCURRENCY. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR AND FOR THE SUPPORTER I- AND FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I AM THANKFUL THAT THEY HAVE AGREED TO COME IN TODAY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH US SO WITH THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM WHEN YOU ARE READY PLEASE BEGIN WITH YOUR OPENING STATEMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MIRZAI PRITCHETT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT MY BILL AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY NINE THAT'S FUNNY. AB ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT VOTING ON IT BUT I APPRECIATE IT SURGERY TO REMOVE IT TOO BUT- AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY NINE WITH A LOT OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ENTITIES WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ACCEPT VIRTUAL CURRENCY FOR GOODS OR SERVICES IF THEY CHOSE TO DO THAT IS TO BE PERMISSIVE IN NATURE ONLY. AND THE DEFINITION OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY- IN THE BILL PRESENTLY IS ONE THAT THE IRS PRESENTLY USES SO THAT THERE'S CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL LAW IN THAT RESPECT. A VIRTUAL CURRENCIES HAVE SEEN A MASSIVE UPTICK IN ADOPTION OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS CCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT AN ESTIMATED ONE FIFTH OF LARGE ORGANIZATIONS IN AMERICA WE USED DIGITAL CURRENCIES BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. MICROSOFT STARBUCKS VISA MASTERCARD AND COCA COLA ARE AMONG SOME OF THE LARGE BUSINESSES ALREADY THAT HAVE ADOPTED CRYPTOCURRENCY USE FOR PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES- MANY DECENTRALIZED VIRTUAL CURRENCIES ARE BASED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. A BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK SIMPLY PUT AND I'M NOT A COMPUTER ENGINEER. BUT THE BASIC IDEA IS IT IS A LIST OF DECENTRALIZED RECORDS. ARE KNOWN AS BLOCKS BETTER- YOU YOU USE CRYPTOGRAPHY TO ACCESS THEM AND THEN WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TO. THE LEDGER IT BECOMES THE NEXT PART OF THE CHAIN HENCE THE NAME. BLOCKCHAIN WHEN TRANSACTIONS REQUESTED HE REQUEST IS BROADCASTED THE ENTIRE DECENTRALIZED NETWORK FOR VERIFICATION. HENCE THE ENHANCED SECURITY- AFTER THE TRANSACTION IS VERIFIED BY THE NETWORK A PERMANENT UNCHANGEABLE BLOCK. CONTAINING THAT TRANSACTION IS ADDED TO THE EXISTING. BLOCKCHAIN A VIRTUAL CURRENCIES OFFER INCREASED CONVENIENCE POTENTIALLY PAYMENTS ARE FAST AND EASY BECAUSE THEY ARE BASED ON A NETWORK SYSTEM- THE TRANSACTIONS ARE ALSO DECENTRALIZED THAT MEANS THERE'S NO TRANSACTION COSTS THERE IS A RISK OF SECURITY FAILURE. OR DATA BREACH BY THE MINISTRY. OF BECAUSE THEY'RE SPREAD OVER A COMPUTER NETWORK THAT IS IN MANY CASES ALL OVER. THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA CONSISTENTLY HAS LED THE WAY IN FOSTERING NEW INNOVATION NEW TECHNOLOGY. BY EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL ADOPTION OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND ALLOWING THE PERMISSION FOR COOPER COMPANIES OR GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TO DO THAT. CALIFORNIA CAN REMAIN ON THE CUTTING EDGE WE DO NEED APPROPRIATE GUARDRAILS THAT'S WHY I'M- VERY GRATEFUL TO THE CHAIR INTO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR BEING WILLING TO LOOK AT THIS. AND START THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROTECT PEOPLE AND USE OUR STRENGTH AS CALIFORNIANS IN TERMS OF OUR HISTORY OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE STRONGEST CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY- I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU BASED ON A TECHNOLOGICAL. OF LEADERSHIP THAT OUR STATE ENJOYS AND BASED ON OUR STRONG HISTORY CONSUMER PROTECTION CALIFORNIA FOR THE BEST PLACE TO START- BEING ON THE CUTTING EDGE. OF WHAT WE CAN UTILIZE CRYPTOCURRENCY FOR AND ALLOW OUR CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES TO USE. ARE CALLING IN AND SUPPORT TO SPEAK ON THE BILL IS OUR FORMER MAJORITY LEADER IAN CALDERON. AND ALSO ON THE LINE I BELIEVE IT'S MICHAEL MAGIC SORRY I MESSED UP YOUR NAME MICHAEL OF MAJORITY ADVISORS TO PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER IT'S BEEN SO NICE LISTENING TO YOUR VOICE IS BEEN VERY NOSTALGIC FOR ME AND I CAN'T I GOT THAT MISSED EVERYBODY AND I MISS BEING UP THERE WITH YOU BUT I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. TO THIS ISSUE- THIS IS- AN EXTENSION OF WORK THAT I HAD BEEN WORKING ON WHEN I WAS THERE WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE I REALLY APPRECIATE- COMING OVER CUNNINGHAM TAKING THIS ON AND- YOU KNOW TRYING TO BE A LEADER IN THE SPACE FOR ALL OF US FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS BUT- YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING A GOOD IN EXISTING LAW THAT SAYS WE CAN'T DO. THAT THAT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT BUSINESS OR A GOVERNMENT CAN'T TRANSACT USING VIRTUAL CURRENCIES BUT THERE'S ALSO NOTHING IN LAW THAT SAYS THAT YOU CAN AND THAT LACK OF. REGULATORY CLARITY BECAUSE OF A LOT OF CONFUSION AND MY INTERESTS MY WORK ON THESE ISSUES IN THE LEGISLATURE WAS ALWAYS FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE MAKE CALIFORNIA YEAH CONTINUE TO BE RELEVANT AND TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE- THAT THE NEXT GENERATION. SB ANYWHERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN ONE PLACE WE'VE BEEN A LEADER IN TACT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IF WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO CREATE CLEAR CLARITY AND CLEAR REGULATION IN THIS SPACE AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE LATER LATER THEIR ALREADY FOUR HUNDRED BUSINESSES ABOUT ABOUT FOR THE BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALREADY TRANSACTING IN VIRTUAL CURRENCIES BUT THIS CONTINUES TO BE A ROADBLOCK TO THE INDUSTRY AND BUSINESSES CONSIDERING STARTING HERE- AND MOVING OPERATIONS HERE AND CONTINUING. TO INVEST YOUR- ON THE OTHER AND WE ALSO HAVE THE- THE ISSUE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION I AGREE- AND SHARE THE CHAIR SENTIMENTS WHEN HE STARTED THIS- TESTIMONY ON THIS BILL THAT WE WANT TO HAVE GOOD CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO PROTECT THOSE ARE TRANSACTING IN AN OPERATING SPACE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THAT THEY ALREADY ARE- AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING COLLECTED THIS SINCE I'VE BEEN WORKING AT THIS YEAR'S IT CONTINUE TO GROW. BECOME MORE PREVALENT AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT- AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN MOVE IN A DIRECTION WHERE WE CAN HAVE A BETTER CONSUMER PROTECTION IS TO CONSIDER POLICIES. THAT PROVIDE DIRECTION FROM A STATE POLICY LEVEL THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND GIVE DIRECTION TO REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDERTOOK THAT THEY WANT TO GET IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THEY'RE INTERESTED- BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OF AN UNDERSTANDING OR DOES NOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE DISCONTENT TO START REGULATING THEN THE SPACE JUST YET. SO STOP THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE I DON'T WANT TO BE TO PUT IT EVAN SAY TOO MANY THE SAME THINGS THAT I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND IT'S OPENING UP REMARKS MADE A LOT OF THE GREAT POINTS BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND YOU WANT TO TRANSACT AND OR ACCEPT VIRTUAL CURRENCIES RIGHT NOW THERE'S A CONCERN. THAT THE STATE ONCE YOU'RE SIX MONTHS DOWN THE LINE A YEAR DEL YEAR DOWN THE LINE IN A PILOT PROGRAM COMMENTED AND TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU SAYING I'M SORRY YOU CANNOT DO THAT UNTIL THERE ARE GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE BUSINESSES THAT YOU DON'T WANT MORE CLARITY THEY NEED MORE- I THINK THAT. YEAH CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO BE LEADER IT COMES TO DEVELOPING POLICY REGULATE AND THAT'S- BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT WHETHER STAY. WHAT WE DO. IS PICKED UP AND GREAT PEOPLE CATERED IN OTHER STATES. TEXAS WYOMING THEIR LEADING RIGHT NOW AND I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT I WOULD TRUST. CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH ON CONSUMER PROTECTION OVER THOSE OTHER STATES THAT RESPECT THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE. BUT WE WANT TO BE A LEADER IN THAT SPACE AND WE NEED TO BE A LEADER IN THIS SPACE. BUT THAT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE DON'T. SPEND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY- SHOWING THE INDUSTRY THAT THIS IS THE PLACE. WHERE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THOUGHTFUL POLICY THOUGHTFUL REGULATION AND CREATE SOME STANDARDS AROUND CONSUMER PROTECTION TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE. WHEN TRANSACTING AND INTERACTING WITH THESE VIRTUAL. CURRENCIES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU AND NEXT WITNESS. WE'RE SEPARATED OUT IN THE MEDICAL CENTER OKAY GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME PART OF AB TWENTY PICKED A NINETY DAY AND ALSO WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU TO MISTER CUNNINGHAM AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN THE STATE. MY NAME'S MIKE MCGEE I'M CURRENTLY A CONSULTANT BEEN WORKING ON CRYPTO RELATED LEGISLATION FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AT INCLUDING AS A LEGISLATIVE AIDE MISTER CALDERON. AB AS WELL AUTHOR ON THE CALIFORNIA BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP'S REPORT WHICH WAS. DELIVERED TO THE LEGISLATURE BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY- ALL THE PRE BUT I WANT TO JUST PROVIDE THAT THE- CON. WITH THE CALDERON DATE. M. TRAILER WHY THIS WOMAN THE AND- KIND OF PERSONAL- BURKE FOR POLICY. AT THIRTY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FROM POPULAR CRYPTO RESEARCH WEBSITE RANKS CALIFORNIA AS THE NUMBER ONE CRYPTO READY STATE. THE RANKING IS BASED ON A BRIEF. NUMBER ONE CRYPTO. INTERNET SEARCHES BY CALIFORNIANS. NUMBER TWO THE NUMBER OF CRYPTO ATMS IN OUR STATE. NUMBER THREE THE NUMBER OF CRYPTOCURRENCY BUILT THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN STATE LEGISLATURE. AT THE IN THE NATION CALIFORNIA STILL RANKS FIRST IN BOTH THE NUMBER OF CRYPTO RELATED INTERNET SEARCHES AND THE NUMBER OF CRYPTO ATM. AND BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY BILLS RELATING TO CRYPTOCURRENCY. AND DESPITE THAT. THE INTEREST SHOWN IN THE INTERNET SEARCHES NUMBER EIGHT YEAH NUMBER OF STARTED BUT THE HAS INDICATED THE CALIFORIA BY THE STUDY'S RANKING IN BOTH THE NUMBER ONE CRYPTO READY STATE. AB AND CONVERSELY ON THE LEGISLATION BY. THE OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES REPORT THAT SEVENTEEN STATES HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION OR RESOLUTIONS RELATING TO CRYPTOCURRENCY. AB EARLIER THIS YEAR IN FEBRUARY COLORADO GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THEY WILL ALLOW RESIDENTS BEGIN PAYING THEIR STATE TAXES WITH CRYPTO BUYERS AT THE SUMMER AT THE LATEST- WHICH IS THE PART IN PART WHAT AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY NINE BECAUSE THEY DO- AND THEN FINALLY AND- WITH YOUR- MADE. AT HELP. WILL FOUR HUNDRED BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER FOUR HUNDRED FORTY BUSINESS. THAT CURRENTLY YOU. PUBLICLY STATE THEY ACCEPT CRYPTO. AT THE NECK HI IF ON THAT WITH PERSPECTIVE WITH NEW YORK WHAT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT. AB AT THAT IS THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT REPORTS WITH THAT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION BUT THE TREND THAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THE MORE MUCK ALL THEM. WITCHES CALIFORNIA HAS A REALLY OUTSIDE HERE INDUSTRY AND OUTSIDE SHARE OF CONSUMERS- FOLKS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN ENGAGING WITH CRYPTO ARE ALREADY TRADING ON CRYPTO AT BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE A- GLARING LACK OF REGULATORY CLARITY TO MATCH THAT. AT NINE. TWENTY SIX EIGHTY NINE WOULD BE A STRONG STEP IN THAT DIRECTION WE BELIEVE WARRANT TO CONTINUE CONVERSATION ON THE ISSUE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE TIME TODAY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS TOPIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM. SINGING SKATE YES HEARING- ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES ON THE PHONE MODERATOR ON THE PHONE.

YOU HAVE NO FURTHER LINE THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY OPPOSITION- FOLKS IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM WE HAVE. ONE GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON THERE FOR THE COUNTY ASSOCIATION OF TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS I KNOW YOU'RE ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEATS THIS AFTERNOON FOR THIS IS THE VISION STILL FEELS AS THOUGH THIS AREA IS NOT- DOESN'T CONTAIN ENOUGH PROTECTIONS FOR COUNTY TREASURER'S TO ACCEPT. CRYPTOCURRENCY IT THIS TIME WE CAN FLUCTUATE SO WILDLY IN IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAT IT ON APRIL TENTH AND DECEMBER TENTH WHEN WE COLLECT PROPERTY TAXES FOR EXAMPLE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN THOSE TWO DEADLINES THAT HAVE A FLUCTUATES ON THE OUT WILDLY. IT COULD AFFECT THE ABILITY TO PAY IT REAL A REAL NEAR TERM APPLICATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WERE OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW VERY STRICT INVESTMENT CRITERIA AS SPECIFICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BANKRUPTCY AND SECURITY IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF THE TREASURES AND DOESN'T POLICY IN ANY COUNTY FOR THOSE REASONS WERE STILL OPPOSED AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- CONSIDERATION OF OUR POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK OU. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. WE DO HAVE A COMMITTEE MEMBER MR STONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. THANK YOU I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION TO BE TALKING ABOUT. CRYPTO CURRENCY IN AND REALLY HOW. WE START TO LOOK AT. OPPORTUNITIES TO CHANGE THE FINANCING SYSTEM I DO BELIEVE THAT CRYPTOCURRENCY HAS THE ABILITY. TO BE BENEFICIAL LONG TERM IN THAT IT CAN REALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT THE- PAYMENT SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS BUT A LOT OF PUSHBACK. A CRYPTOCURRENCY BECAUSE IT IT WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE OUT THAT LITTLE 3% THAT'S THERE THAT WE THAT. MERCHANTS ACTUALLY END UP PAYING FOR ALL ALONG THE WAY. HOWEVER I'D I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I'M HOPING THAT IT DOESN'T COME UP PREMATURELY AND DAMAGE THE ABILITY TO HAVE A LONGER TERM CONVERSATION ABOUT CRYPTOCURRENCY AND THE REASON REALLY IS THAT CRYPTOCURRENCY RIGHT NOW IS LOOKING FOR LEGITIMACY. AS THEY SHOULD BE AND THIS IS JUST AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE SOME SEMBLANCE OF LEGITIMACY AS THEY TRY AND WRK OUT. WHAT THE- HOW CRYPTOCURRENCY ULTIMATELY CAN FUNCTION IN OVERALL IN IN A PAYMENT SYSTEM. AND IF PRIVATE COMPANIES WANT TO TAKE THE RISK OF THE VOLATILITY AND WHAT CRYPTOCURRENCY DOES OUR MEANS THAT THEY CAN DO THAT THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS AS REGULATORY REGULATORS BOTH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL REALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER REGULATORS A CURRENCY OR REGULAR HIS SECURITY OR WHAT TO DO AROUND. AND UNTIL SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE THERE IS NOT APPROPRIATE CONSUMER PART A COULD PROPER CONSUMER PROTECTION FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WITH THIS BILL DOES WITH RESPECT TO CITIES AND COUNTIES WHO ARE AND HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME REALLY CASH STRAPPED. AND IF WE OPEN UP THIS IN IN PROVIDE SOME LEGITIMACY MY WORRY IS THAT SOME OF THESE ENTITIES WOULD GO AND DO JUST THAT AND NOW START TAKING CRYPTO CURRENCIES IN TAKING ON THE RISK OF THE VOLATILITY OF THOSE CURRENCIES REPRESENTS. THEY THEIR THIS IS PUBLIC MONEY THAT THEY'RE MANAGING. AND IF ALL OF A SUDDEN GIVEN THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CURRENCY. A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COFFERS OF THE WEEK COUNTIES COLLECT MONEY COUNTIES COLLECT MONEY. NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTY BUT FOR A LOT OF THE- AGENCIES IN THAT COUNTIES CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AT ALL. AND IF THAT FUN NOW IS BASED TO SOME EXTENT OF CRYPTO CURRENCY IN THE WRIST THAT THAT REPRESENTS. AND THERE THAT VOLATILITY GOES NEGATIVE. THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO BE IN A WORLD OF HURT. AND THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING THEN TO US THE STATE TO TRY AND HELP SOLVE THIS AND BEAR THIS OUT. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW ULTIMATELY HOW THIS IS WORKABLE RIGHT NOW. THAT I THINK THIS INDUSTRY NEEDS TO FROM A GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT INSTEAD OF GETTING GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE THE VOLATILITY RISK THAT CRYPTO CURRENCIES MEAN. IF WE CAN GET TO A FRAMEWORK THAT ESTABLISHES WHETHER IT'S A CURRENCY WHETHER IT'S A SECURITY HOWEVER THAT DECISIONS GOING TO COME DOWN. MANAGE THAT AND THEN WE CAN GO THROUGH THAT PROVIDE ULTIMATELY SOME STABILITY. IN THESE MARKETS WE'D BE ON A MUCH BETTER TRACK TO DO THAT SO I DO NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO QUASH THE DISCUSSION HERE. BUT I'M VERY LEERY OF. SENDING WRONG SIGNALS OUT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BE THEY SPECIAL DISTRICTS CITIES OR COUNTIES. THAT MAY WANT TO START TO ADOPT THIS. IF THEY DO AND TAKE THE RISK THAT'S BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR TAXPAYERS ALTHOUGH I SAY THAT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THEY'RE GONNA COME TO US COUNTIES ARE ARM OF THE STATE. AND WHEN THEY FAIL. STATE NEEDS TO STEP IN. USUALLY TO BAIL THEM OUT WHY WOULD WE BE TAKING THIS RISK. IN A WHOLE AREA THAT IS. HAS DEMONSTRATED SUCH SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY OVER THE YEARS THERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD SOME INVESTMENTS IN IN CRYPTO MYSELF INCLUDED. AND WATCHED IT AND I MADE THOSE INVESTMENTS TO JUST TO SORT OF SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AS IT WENT UP AND DOWN. I'M TALKING LESS THAN A HUNDRED. THOUGH ALTAMENTE BECAUSE IT WAS. TO SORT OF BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE MARKETS AND ALL SO. WE SHOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION AS A LEGISLATURE OF PREMATURELY CREATING. THIS VENEER OF LEGITIMACY UNLESS AND UNTIL WE REALLY HAVE THE RIGHT FRAMEWORKS IN PLACE THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON AND GET. THEY THE APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENTS TO PUT TOGETHER THE RIGHT KIND OF FRAMEWORK AND EVEN DECIDE HE GAVE ITS CURRENCY REGULATE AYE CURRENCY IF IT'S A IF IT'S INVESTMENT OR SECURITY REGULATORS A SECURITY. BUT NOBODY'S REALLY WILLING TO DO THAT WITH THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO DO RATHER THAN JUST OPENING UP THE DOORS AND SAYING SURE YOU CAN TRADE IN THE US. WHEN YEP THEY PROBABLY COULD. I'MNOT SURE I WOULD ENCOURAGE COUNTIES OR CITIES OR SPECIAL THIS WEEK TO DO THAT PRIVATE BUSINESSES THAT'S THEY'RE MAKING THEIR OWN RISK ASSESSMENT BUT THERE'S LESS AT STAKE BECAUSE IT'S NOT PUBLIC MONEY. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC MONEY I GET A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCERNED WITHOUT THE REGULATORY BACKSTOP. THANK YOU OF. MEMBER STONE DR CHOI WITH YEAH- NOT OR SO- ECHO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS- THE ASSEMBLYMAN STONE S. RAISED UP IN THE FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD FORUM THANK TO SMM A CUNNINGHAM TO- BRING IT UP BUT- AS A LACK OF PUBLIC HEARING FORMAT. RATHER THAN ASKING US TO VOTE ON IT THAT BECAUSE OF THIS IS A VERY HUGE. ISSUE I KNOW- WAS- DEVELOPING AND OF WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE CRYPTOCURRENCY IS HERE TO STAY I BELIEVE- HOWEVER. BY RECOGNIZING BY THE CALIFORNIA S- LEADER OF THIS- MOVEMENT TO AMEND THAT DESIRE IS GOOD BUT I THINK WE NEED TO- TAKE A PRECAUTION BECAUSE THIS OF RECOGNIZING CRYPTOCURRENCY S. ON MACOS- A SECONDARY- US DOLLARS. BECAUSE A WE ARE AT THE GYM I SEE THAT THE PAYMENT SYSTEM AND THAT SOME COMPANIES- SUCH AS- TESTS A LOT I KNOWN THAT THE ONE TIME- ELEVEN MUSCAT DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD TAKE CRYPTO CURRENCY TO PURCHASE FOR THE- CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE- THEY A TESLA VEHICLE AND THEN HE- STOPPED IT. AND THE SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA. NEXT FORM I DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD BE IS A SECOND HEARING TIME. TO HAVE- COMPANIES LARGE COMPANIES SO WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ARE SUPPORTING THAT IDEA. THAT THAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING AND HERE AND- SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. GROUPS OR EXPERIENCE- OR EVEN ELEVEN MUSKA SAY WHY DID YOU STOP WE CAN ASK WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM. I THINK I THOUGHT THOUGH CREDIBLE FORM MORE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE- OUR MEMBERS ARE ASKED TO VOTE BECAUSE I ASSUME MOST OF US ARE NOT EXPORTS. THE FUTURE. THE IMPACT OF THIS A POLICY ONCE WE MORANI IS SOUNDS GOOD AND- WE BORDER ON IT UP BUT THERE MAY BE A VERY DEEP THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS SOME POINTS WERE RAISED TO BUY AS THE MINIMUM WAS A STORM SO I THINK THAT THAT- IS OF SAMARIA- TO SUGGEST THE FORTY FORTY TO PROVIDE ANOTHER FORM SO HEARING FORMAT TO EDUCATE US. THANK YOU DR CHOI AND- MR GABRIEL ASSEMBLY MEMBER YET THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND- YOU WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR STARTING THIS CONVERSATION IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT ONE- AND I WOULD JUST ECHO THE RESPECT FOR YOU AND FOR OUR- FROM A MAJORITY LEADER THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE KAREN FROM OTHERS HERE- AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS SUCH AN AFFRONT CONVERSATION AND I THINK THERE'S THE CRYPTO PIECE OF THIS THERE'S ALSO JUST THE LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE. PART OF THAT CONVERSATION TOMORROW THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE- TO START TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE POTENTIAL USES OF THAT INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY- AND I'LL JUST REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT I THINK IN SOME WAYS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND IS A MEMBER CHOI ARE SAYING THE SAME THING WHICH WHICH WE DON'T OFTEN MAYBE ARE ALWAYS HERE AROUND HERE- AND I SHARE. I THINK SOME OF THEIR PERSPECTIVE HERE WHICH IS THAT THERE'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES HERE BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS A LEGISLATURE WITH BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY- YOU KNOW THIS IS CERTAINLY THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE AND I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S MUCH DOUBT ABOUT THAT- WITH A LOT OF- REALLY POTENTIALLY EXCITING AND INTERESTING USES AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A LEADER ON THAT- AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO START THIS CONVERSATION WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IN THE RIGHT WAY- THERE'S A- SIMULTANEOUS CONVERSATION GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT. OUR COLLEAGUE MENTIONED- THAT I THINK IS GOING TO HAVE SOME REALLY POWERFUL IMPLICATIONS FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY FOR THE WAY THAT WE- YOU KNOW REALLY START TO THINK WHAT IS THE REGULATORY ARCHITECTURE SO I JUST WANT TO ECHO YOU KNOW SUPPORT FOR THE FOR THE IDEA OF HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS- BUT ALSO DOING IT IN THE RIGHT DELIBERATE THOROUGH THOUGHTFUL WAY I THINK WE CAN THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE WORK CALIFORNIA CAN BE. ON THE CUTTING EDGE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES BUT ALSO REALLY YOU KNOW THINK VERY VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THIS SO THAT WE'RE DOING ITS OWN A WAY THAT PROTECTS PUBLIC FUNDS YOU KNOW PROTECT CONSUMER CONSUMER INTERESTS- ANNA AND I AM JUST GLAD THAT YOU'RE STARTING US ON THE CONVERSATION SO APPRECIATE YOU. THANK YOU CINEMA GABRIEL ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM. MEMBERS CNN. CINNAMON WHAT YOU LIKE TO OFFER SOME CLOSING COMMENTS. SURE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU KEEP AN OPEN MIND WITH RESPECT TO CRYPTO I'M HEARING THAT FROM EVERYBODY I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU THE CHAIR AGAIN FOR- YOU'RE PUMPING THE BRAKES A LITTLE BIT MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THIS AND THOUGHTFUL WAY I GET THE NOTE OF CAUTION AND I. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONES POINT I GET THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUBLIC MONEY AND PRIVATE MONEY AND THERE'S A DISTRICT DIFFERENT RISK FACTOR THERE AND THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- THERE'S ALSO REGULATORY RISK RIGHT SO THAT'S THE QUESTION I THINK THIS COMMITTEE. OVERTIMES GOING TO HAVE TO. COME TO TERMS WITH BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT NOTHING SAYING YOU CAN OR CANNOT DO THIS. EXCEPT SAY. BIG POINTY IS ONE EXAMPLE FOR. LARGE AMOUNTS OF COCA COLA OR WHATEVER IT IS- AND SO BUSINESSES THAT ARE CHOOSING TO DO THAT ARE. PLACED IN A POSITION OF UNCERTAINTY OR THEY DON'T KNOW IF SOMETHING'S GONNA COME ALONG LATER AND- PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM. SO TO SPEAK- I DON'T I DON'T HEAR THAT. FROM THIS COMMITTEE IT DOESN'T SOUND SUPER LIKELY BUT- CERTAINLY THAT SORT OF AMBIGUOUS SITUATION THOSE BUSINESSES ARE AND ARE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED. ON THE FEDERAL PIECE- YEAH THIS. THE I DID DO SOME LEGAL RESEARCH THE PREVAILING LEGAL OPINION IS THAT. CRYPTO CURRENCIES ARE NOT A SECURITY UNDER THE US SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT- THEY'RE ALSO NOT A FIAT CURRENCY ISSUED BY A GOVERNMENT OR CENTRAL BANK SO. THERE THIS NEW DIFFERENT THINGS. AND THEY HAVE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE ALLUDED TO. A DOCTOR CHOI- POTENTIAL TO CUT OUT A LOT OF MIDDLE MEN AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S VERY DISRUPTIVE VERY PRO CONSUMER POTENTIALLY AND- YEAH THERE'S SO MANY LATENT BENEFITS TO. THE SECURITY THE DECENTRALIZATION THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE EXCHANGED PEER TO PEER I MEAN THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE ARE TREMENDOUSLY POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL SO I'M I'M GLAD THAT YOU AFFORD ME THE TIME TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. AND OBVIOUSLY WON'T BE ASKING FOR VOTE AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND I THINK MAYBE ON THE PUBLIC IECE THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES. IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WHERE IT MAKES SENSE TO DO SOME SORT OF PILOT PROGRAM. AT SOME CANNOT SENATORS SOMEWHERE. WHERE THERE'S APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS IN A PLAN IN PLACE IN CASE- THE VOLATILITY GOES THE WRONG DIRECTION AND YOU ARE OR MAYBE WITH A SMALL SPECIAL SERVICES DISTRICT I'D I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS THERE- BUT I THINK- BLOCKCHAIN WRIT LARGE AND CRYPTO AS PART OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IS IT IS GOING TO BE INEVITABLE I THINK IT WILL BE THE WAY A LOT OF OUR TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE- YOU KNOW WHETHER THE STATE NEWS OR NOT AND PROBABLY A DECADE PROBABLY FASTER THAN. THAN WE THINK I THINK A LOT OF VITAL RECORDS WILL BE THERE A LOT HEALTH RECORDS TO BE THAT EITHER- IF THERE WERE. FOR EXAMPLE VERIFICATION AN EDT UNEMPLOYMENT- TO PREVIEW TOMORROW'S BILL EDT UNEMPLOYMENT. BENEFITS WERE VERIFIED AND PUT ON THE BLOCKCHAIN YOU WOULD HAVE NO TWENTY TO THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR FRAUD IN THE EDT THE SYSTEM JUSTICE. AS ONE EXAMPLE SO THERE'S BENEFITS WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS ON THE ON THE- ON THAT END AS WELL AS LONG AS IT'S DONE RIGHT AND DONE SECURELY SO. GOOD LUCK FIGURING THIS ALL OUT. AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER COMING UP FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I. WANT TO ALSO EXPRESS A FULL COMMITMENT. ON BEHALF OF THIS CHAIR AND COMMITTEE TO DIVE DEEP INTO THE SUBJECT AND TO DO SO EXPEDITIOUSLY. SO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN BE A FRONT RUNNER AND A LEADER AND A PARTNER- WITH OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN ADDRESSING THIS. NEW TECHNOLOGY. AND A NEW WAY OF DOING THINGS WITH THAT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WITH THAT I AM GOING TO. OPEN UP FOR ADD ONS TO. OUR BILLS THAT WE HAVE HEARD TODAY AND.
