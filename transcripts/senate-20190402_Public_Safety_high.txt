BEFORE ELEVEN SO WE WILL NOT HEAR THOSE THIS MORNING AND THEN ONE SECOND ALRIGHT SO WE WILL BEGIN. GOOD SENATOR -- PORTANTINO IS HERE LET'S BEGIN WITH -- SB SIXTY ONE WE CAN [inaudible] I GUESS. OF THE SATELLITE FOR SENATOR PORTANTINO BEGINS WITH YOUR ALSO PUTTING SB -- FOUR THREE NINE SENATOR UMBERG'S BILL ON CONSENT. SO SENATOR PORTANTINO YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK. THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- TAMPERS ANY SB SIXTY ONE WHICH PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FOR MAKING AN APPLICATION TO PURCHASE MORE THAN ONE FIREARM. WITHIN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD. FIREARMS WILL NOT BE DELIVERED WHEN THE DEALER IS NOT IS NOTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT WITHIN THE PRECEDING THIRTY DAY PERIOD THE PURCHASER HAD MADE ANOTHER APPLICATION PURCHASE FIREARMS. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE LEGISLATURE WHOSE ENACTED TO LIMIT THE PURCHASE OF HANDGUNS BUT AS RECENT DATA SUGGEST LONG GUNS ARE BECOMING A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF CALIFORNIA'S GUN TRAFFICKING PROBLEM. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS CALIFORNIANS HAVE TYPICALLY PURCHASED MORE LONG GUNS AND HAND GUNS. OF THE 260-006-0080 TWO GUNS USED IN CRIMES THAT WERE INTRODUCED A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AUTOMATIC AUTOMATED FARM SYSTEM DATABASE. ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WERE LONG GUNS. THERE IS NO REASON WHY SOMEONE WOULD NEED TO BUY MORE THAN ONE LONG. A MONTH AFTER ALL YOU ONLY HAVE ONE FINGER. PREVENTING THE FLOW OF GUNS IS IMPORTANT TO PUBLIC SAFETY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FIREARMS A HANDGUN OR LONG ON OR PURCHASE NEW FROM A DEALER OR THROUGH A PRIVATE TRANSACTION LIMITING FIREARM SALES TO ONE GUN PER MONTH IS A RECOGNIZED STRATEGY. TO REDUCE GUN TRAFFICKING AND KEEPING FIREARMS OUT OF DANGEROUS HANDS -- AS WE KNOW MANY OF THE RECENT -- TRAGEDIES ON OUR SCHOOL CAMPUSES WERE PERPETRATED BY -- TEENAGERS WITH LONG GUNS TODAY I AM -- PLEASED AND PROUD TO BE JOINED BY. AMEND WILCOX FROM THE BRADY CAMPAIGN BRADY YOU CALIFORNIA UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF SB SIXTY ONE AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE. A GOOD MORNING. AND THIS IS MY FIRST TIME AT THIS WITH THIS COMMITTEE THIS YEAR AND SO I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE OUR NEW NAME. WHICH IS ARE STILL DOES NOT ROLL OFF THE TONGUE -- BRADY CALIFORNIA UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE ARE PRETTY CALIFORNIA FOR SHORT -- SO THIS BILL HAS THIS POLICIES BEEN BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE MANY TIMES WE HAVE SUPPORTED EVERY YEAR. AND WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT AS THE SENATOR SAID AND LIMITING BALK PURCHASES OF FIREARMS IS INDEED A WAY TO PREVENT CONTRACTING IT STANDS TO REASON THAT SOMEONE BUYING FIFTY GUNS AT ONCE -- IS TURN AROUND AND SELLING MOST IF NOT ALL OF THEM. ALSO IN GENERAL THE BRADY CAMPAIGN CALIFORNIA BRADY BRADY CALIFORNIA -- FEELS THAT LONG GUNS AND HAND GUNS SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME WAY -- LONG GUNS NOWADAYS ARE -- HIGH POWERED SPORTING RIFLES THAT CAN BE QUICKLY WE LOADED AND CERTAINLY POSE A BIG RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AN EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS POLICY IS SO IMPORTANT IS THAT -- THERE WAS A CASE WHERE A COUPLE WAS GOING -- TO PAWN SHOPS -- DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND PURCHASING AS MANY LONG GUNS THEY COULD. IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEN EACH TOOK THOSE GUNS ACROSS THE BORDER AND SOLD THEM FOR BIG PROFITS IN MEXICO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE WANNA POINT WITH THIS LAW. BASED ON DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- IN THE YEAR AND A HALF AFTER LONG GONE RECORDS -- STARTED TO BE RETAINED BY THE DEPARTMENT -- WE FOUND THE EIGHTY ONE POINT 9% OF LONG GUNS ARE SOLD AS A SINGLE PURCHASE WITHIN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD SO MOST GUN BUYERS ACTUALLY WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS LAW. BUT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE SPECTRUM THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL WHO PURCHASED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN GUNS AND ONE MONTH -- SO AGAIN THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO STOP THE ILLEGAL FLOW OF GUNS AND GUN TRAFFICKERS AND PARTICULARLY TO PREVENT THOSE OF LEGAL GUNS FROM GETTING INTO ARE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES -- SO MANY OF WHICH ARE DEVASTATED BY CAN CRIME SITE URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND ALSO I'M AUTHORIZED YEAH I'M ON BEHALF OF THE BAY AREA STUDENT. ACTIVISTS -- THE TRAIN WAS TO LATER THEY ASKED ME TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SENATOR PORTANTINO AYE KATHY LYNCH REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY SAFARI CLUB INTERNATIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTS SINCE COALITION. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS SENATOR MENTION THIS BILL'S BEEN BEFORE THE COMMITTEE MANY TIMES -- WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT -- FIREARMS OWNERSHIP IS THE SECOND AMENDMENT ALL RIGHT AND THE EXAMPLES AND MISS -- AMANDA USES A CLEARLY ALL THESE FOLKS HAVE TO GO THROUGH A DEALER -- YOU FOLKS HAVE CERTAINLY -- PUT TOGETHER A FRAMEWORK THAT REQUIRES ALL FIREARMS TRANSACTIONS TO GO THROUGH A LICENSED FIREARM DEALER -- THERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE -- SPORTSMAN IN PARTICULAR RECREATIONAL SHOOTERS -- PURCHASE MORE THAN THIS IN A MONTH IF THERE'S SOME REASON THAT THEY MAY WISH TO DO IT IT IS THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT. THERE ARE SO MANY GUN LAWS ON THE BOOKS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP. AND THE ARM PROHIBITED PERSONS PROGRAM IS WHAT WE ALL NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON RATHER THAN PUTTING MORE BURDENS ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE FALLEN OR ARE IN A PROHIBITED CLASS. DO NOT ACCESS FIREARMS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING. NINE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR SENATOR JACKSON'S. YES THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TENACITY IN TRYING TO REDUCE ANA OF GUN VIOLENCE -- I'D LIKE TO REMIND TO THE OPPOSITION THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT. IS NOT AN UNLIMITED RIGHT. AND SO THERE ARE. REASONABLE REGULATIONS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE THAT ARE AUTHORIZED BY LAW AND SO WHEN I HEAR THAT THAT EVERYBODY HAS A SECOND MAN RIGHT WE ALL HAVE RIGHTS. BUT NONE OF THEM ARE ON LIMITED SO WITH THAT. I THINK THIS IS A COMMONSENSE BILL I THINK WE NEED. TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE AND RECOGNIZE. THAT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT IT. AT THIS I THINK IS A COMMONSENSE BILL AND WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. I'M ANY OTHER. COMMENTS NURSERY HAVE A MOTION AND A SENATOR. PORTANTINO I SEE FOR CLOTHES BUT I WANTED BEFORE ASKING FOR YOUR CLOTHES -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT BACK ON DO APPRECIATE THAT -- THE ID SO. WHEN THERE'S MULTIPLE VETO MESSAGES YOU CAN ALSO IT CAN OFTEN BE -- RATHER DISCOURAGING BUT THIS IS A VERY GOOD BILL AND IF YOU ARE AMENDING AT ANY POINT IN THE FUTURE I WOULD APPRECIATE BEING ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU AND YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- BE HAPPY -- EIGHT DELICIOUS A CO AUTHOR AND APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF ON THIS BILL AND THAT TOO THAT FOLLOW AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT OF EXCELLENT LET'S DO A ROLL CALL. MOTIONS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER HI. HI MORE LOCK. MORE LIKE NO BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MOREAU. BROWN NOW WIENER. WIENER AYE. WE WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN AND NOW -- CINDER PORTANTINO YOU CAN GO TO SB. ONE SEVENTY TWO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE CHAIRS AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH. MY OFFICE -- SO PRODUCTIVELY ON A BILL THAT HAS SAYS SEVERAL MOVING PARTS ARE REALLY APPRECIATE -- EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS A A STRONG -- PRODUCTIVE -- EFFORT I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB ONE SEVEN TWO WHICH HAS MULTI AS I SAID MULTIPLE MOVING FACTORS WITHIN THE BILL ALL RELATING. TO ENSURING FIREARMS ARE PROPERLY LOCKED AND STORED I MAY SAY THAT AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FIREARMS ARE PROPERLY LOCKED AND TORED. IMPROPER STORAGE OF FIREARMS IN THE HOME ARE KILLING OUR YOUTH THE VAST MAJORITY OF ACCIDENTAL FIREARM DEATHS SUICIDE AND SENSELESS ACTS OF VIOLENCE AMONG CHILDREN. ARE RELATED TO EASY ACCESS TO FIREARMS EXPANDING ON CHILD ACCESS PREVENTION LAWS WILL LOWER RATES ON UNINTENTIONAL FIREARM DEATHS AMONGST OUR USE. SB ONE SEVENTY TWO WOULD AUTHORIZE THE TEMPORARY TRANSFER OF A FIREARM WITHOUT A FIREARMS DEALERS PARTICIPATION. TO A PERSON WHO IS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER FOR SAFE KEEPING TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED. FOR SUICIDE SB ONE SEVENTY TWO MAKES THE CURRENT. MAKES THE CURRENT CRIME OF CRIMINAL STORAGE AFFABLE TO THE STORAGE OF AN UNLOADED AS WELL AS LOADED FIREARM. THE BILL WOULD PLACE ON THE TEN YEAR PROHIBITION LIST PERSONS CONVICTED OF THIS CRIME WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM OWNING A FIREARM OR AMMUNITION FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS. FROM THE DATE OF CONVICTION. THIS ONLY APPLIES TO PERSONS CONVICTED OF THIS VIOLATION AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY CURRENT LAW MAKES IT A CRIME TO KEEP A HAND GUN WITHIN A PREMISE WITH KNOWLEDGE AT A CHILD THEIR PERSON PROHIBITED FOR PROVIDING A FIREARM IS LIKELY TO GAIN ACCESS. IF THE CHILD ARE PROHIBITED PERSON OBTAINS ACCESS TO THE HANDGUN AND CARRIES IT OFF PREFERENCES SB ONE SEVEN TWO WOULD MAKE THIS CRIME APPLICABLES ALL TYPES OF FIREARMS AND PUT THIS CRIME AGAIN ON THE TEN YEAR LIST. CURRENT LAW MAKES IT A CRIME FOR AN OWNER OR LEGAL OCCUPANT OF A RESIDENTS TO STORE FIREARM IN THAT RESIDENTS IF THE PERSON KNOWS ANOTHER PERSON RESIDING IN THAT RESIDENTS IS PROHIBITED. FROM PERFECT PERFECT. POSSESSING A FIREARM UNLESS THE FIREARM IS SECURED THIS BILL WOULD PUT THIS CRIME AGAIN ON THE TEN DAY LIST. AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL ENACT THE KEEP OUR SENIOR SAY FACT AND WOULD REQUIRE LET REGULATIONS TO PROCEDURES FOR A FIREARM AND AMMUNITION TO BE CENTRALLY STORED IN A LOCKED GUN SAFE. WITHIN A RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY AND THAT'S A NEW -- PART OF THIS WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES APARTMENTS WE THINK OUR SENIORS NEED. THE SAVE THAT STORAGE AND SAFETY IN THEIR RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES AS WELL. THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE A FACILITY TO PREPARE AND MAINTAIN AN INDIVIDUAL WEAPONS INVENTORY FOR EACH FIREARM IN TYPE OF AMMUNITION STORED WITHIN THE FACILITY. AND SUBMIT THE INVENTORIES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- I HAVE -- SEVERAL PEOPLE HERE TO TESTIFY MONICA MILLER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES -- FOR OUR C. F. E. REFORM AND AMANDA WILCOX AGAIN AND THE RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY PIECE WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY OUR SENIOR LEGISLATURE MANY OF YOU HAVE HAD VISITS FROM THEM AS THEY COME UP. WITH THEIR LEGISLATIVE AGENDA AND SO WE WERE GOING TO DO THE SAFE STORAGE PROVISION AND WE SAW THAT THEY HAD A COMPANION PIECE AND SO WE PUT IT IN THIS AS WELL AND SO OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL TO THEM AS WELL. AND WITH THAT I LET MY WITNESSES TAKE IT OVER. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MONICA MILLER REPRESENTING CONSUMER ADVOCATES FOR RC AT THE REFORM AND THAT'S RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. SO THE REASON WHY WE BRING THIS MEASURE FORWARD IS BECAUSE ON RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY WERE CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE UNDER STATUTE. AND THEY'RE CONSIDERED NON MEDICAL MODEL SO IT'S SOMEONE'S HOME FOR EXAMPLE A SIX BED UNIT ETCETERA HE GOT CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND YOU GOT CARE GIVERS. ON WITHIN THIS MODEL AS OUR AGING POPULATION HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT 70% OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THESE FACILITIES HAVE SOME FORM OF ON ALZHEIMERS OR DEMENTIA RELATED. DISORDERS AND AS SUCH YOU KNOW WE GO IN AND THERE'S A GUN JUST SITTING ON A DESK OR A GUN IN A DESK DRAWER AND IT'S NOT PROPERLY. STORED AND WE CAN'T TELL THEM BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO HAVE THAT FIREARMS WE CAN'T TELL THEM THEY CAN'T HAPPEN UNLESS O REDO THE WHOLE MODEL. WHICH WERE NOT INTERESTED IN DOING THAT AT THIS TIME HOWEVER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SON MECHANISM THAT THOSE FIREARMS ARE STORED PROPERLY. MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WHEN COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING COMES IN TO DO AN AUDIT OF THE FACILITY WHICH HAPPENS PRETTY REGULARLY BUT THEY HAVE SOME FORM THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT AND SAY. OKAY YES YOU DO ALLOW FIREARMS IN THIS FACILITY HOW ARE THEY PROPERLY STORED XTERRA SO IT'S REALLY JUST A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE SO AGAIN WE'RE NOT TOGETHER FIREARMS AWAY OR AMMUNITION WE'RE JUST ENSURING THAT THEY ARE SAFE. AND THAT'S ARTICLE ON SO THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA. WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT STRENGTHENING OUR CHILD ACCESS PREVENTION AND SAFE STORAGE LAWS AND OBVIOUSLY THOSE LAWS WE FEEL SHOULD APPLY TO UNLOADED FIREARMS -- AS WELL AS LOADED AND TO ALL FARMS NOT JUST HAND GUNS AND ADDING THE TENURE FARM PROHIBITION FOR VIOLATIONS TO US IS A LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE IF SOMEONE IS A RESPONSIBLE WITH THE GUN. AND MAKE SENSE THAT THEY TEMPORARILY CAN I HAVE A GUN AND I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WAS SCHOOL SHOOTINGS I THINK THE NUMBER 6470% -- OF OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THE GUN DOES COME FROM THE HOME AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT GUNS ARE PROPERLY STORED IN THE HOME AND CHILDREN COULD NOT HAVE ACCESS SCHOOLS ARE SAY FIRST COMMUNITIES ARE SAFER -- IN TERMS OF THE AND THANK YOU FOR AMENDING THE BILL IN ADDING THIS PROVISION REGARDING -- TEMPERED LE OWNING A FIREARM TO PREVENT A SUICIDE. ARE THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT IS -- VERY IMPORTANT TO ME OVER HALF OF GUN DEATHS OURS. ARE SUICIDE WITH A FIREARM IN MY WORLD COUNTY -- THAT IS OUR GUN VIOLENCE PROBLEM ALL THE SUICIDE EXPERTS IN LITERATURE SAY WHEN SOMEONE'S AT RISK OF SUICIDE GET THE GUN OUT OF THE HOME WELL UNDER OUR CURRENT LENDING LAWS UNLESS YOU HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO LIVES NEARBY IT IS IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO GET THAT IN THE VICES GIVE THE GUN TO A TRUSTED FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER RIGHT NOW WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE TO BREAK THE LAW? IF THEY'RE GIVEN THE GUN TO A TRUSTED FRIEND -- I THINK THE BILL HAS THE RIGHT -- PARAMETERS AROUND THAT THAT THAT CAN CANNOT BE USES JUST LOCKED UP -- SO THAT THE PERCENT RISK CANNOT GAIN ACCESS SO I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MATTER THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT JUST [inaudible] JUST. WARNING BRANDS TO WILL BE HALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. CHAIRMAN AND PRESIDENT OF THIS CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING AGAIN MADAM CHAIR SENATOR PORTANTINO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAPPING LYNCH -- REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION I CERTAINLY -- CONCUR WITH MANY OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN STATED CERTAINLY WE SUPPORT AND BELIEVE IN SAFE STORAGE LAWS -- I BELIEVE THAT THE THE RESIDENTIAL CARE PIECE CERTAINLY IS A PIECE THAT WE CAN WORK ON THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION HAS EXPANDED GREAT RESOURCES WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL AGENCIES TO WORK ON SUICIDE PREVENTION AND IT'S ROLLED OUT A WHOLE PROGRAM THAT BE HAPPY TO SHARE. WITH THE SENATOR OUR CONCERN IS THE TEN YEAR PROBATION. THE TRIPPING HAZARDS THAT CAN OCCUR THERE. AGAIN ON THE TEN YEAR PROBATION IS USUALLY BEEN REFER TO FOR VIOLENT OFFENSES SEVENTIES OR NEGLIGENCE AND OF STANDARD CERTAINLY IF YOU. TRAVEL THIS ROAD AND CERTAINLY THINGS LIKE LEAVING CANNABIS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ALCOHOL -- OTHER THINGS OUT WERE YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE HOME THAT WOULD BE VULNERABLE OR NOT OF AGE WOULD BE -- JERMAINE AND THIS CONVERSATION SO WE'RE REALLY OPPOSED TO THE TEN YEAR PROBATION ON NOT OPPOSED TO THE TO WORKING ON SOME OF THE OTHER PIECES OF THIS THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS BUT I'M SURE A GROUP OF SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION AND GUNNERS A CALIFORNIA. I WON'T REPEAT EVERYTHING MY COLLEAGUE SAID BUT WE'RE PRETTY MUCH SPOT ON WE TO STAND FOR SAFE GUN HANDLING THE SAFE GUN STORAGE. BUT AGAIN THE TEN YEAR PROBATION IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T EXCEPT FOR IF SOMEONE MAKING A MISTAKE. WE HAVE -- MANY LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO MIGHT JUST ABOUT THIS THIS BILL WOULD APPLY. TO HUNTING CAMPS AND AND DOT CLUBS IN OTHER LOCATIONS TO WHERE -- WOULD BE DEFINED AS A RESIDENTS WE HAVE OVER TEN THOUSAND AREN'T PREPARED FELONS VIOLENT FELONS ON OUR STREET THAT WOULD REALLY LIKE OUR OFFICERS TO BE ABLE FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND IN THE FARMS OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND SAID ATTORNEY LAW BY DISTANCE AND UNDER THIS TENURE PROHIBITIONIST THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT -- I KNOW THAT -- SENATOR MITCHELL HAD A QUESTION -- COMIC YOU MADAM CHAIR THOMAS MILLER I WAS STRUCK BY YOUR TESTIMONY -- WHEN I THINK ABOUT ON THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT RESIDE AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES AND THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT? OF ALL THE KINDS OF FACILITIES THAT COMMITTEE CARE LICENSE IS REQUIRED TO HAVE OVERSIGHT -- IT. I'M. CURIOUS AS TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH THIS IS REALLY A PROBLEM. I'M GLAD SUPPORT THE BILL I'M NOT QUESTION IT BUT IT JUST YOUR TESTIMONY -- STOP ME IN MY TRACKS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE YOU FEE THREAD YOU PUT NOW MORNING ABOUT ALL LICENSE CARE FACILITIES AND WHAT THEIR POLICIES ARE. SO -- UNDER CURRENT LOT. FACILITY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY TAKE FIREARMS AND WE ACTUALLY WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE SENATOR STAFF WHICH WE APPRECIATE AND COMING UP WITH THEM AN AMENDMENT THAT SAYS IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT. FIREARMS THAT YOUR POLICY IS YOUR FACILITY YOU ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THIS BILL WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE A QUIPS ON COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING. WITH THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES MY ARMS AND WHO DOESN'T -- CARS MILLER RESIDENTS OF THE FACILITIES TO POSSESS FIREARMS CORRECT YES SO AFTER RESIDENT IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO INTO ONE OF THESE FACILITIES BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S CREATED AS A RESIDENTIAL. FACILITY YOU CAN BRING YOUR ANIMAL WITH YOU YOU CAN BRING YOUR FIREARM WITH YOU'LL WHATEVER BECAUSE IT'S NON MEDICAL ON WHICH IS HOUSE CREATED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE HAVING SAID THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE EQUIPPED MEDICARE LICENSING WITH THE ABILITY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THAT FACILITY AND HOW. TO APPROPRIATELY DETERMINE IF IT'S STORED PROPERLY SWITCHES SETTING STANDARDS ARE A WIDE BUT AGAIN WE NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. COMMUNITY ARE LICENSING HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THIS AND THAT SOMETHING WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON WITH THE SENATOR AND HIS STAFF MOVING FOR AND I'M CLEAR THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHTS TO BRING THEIR PROPERTY AND BUT IT IS A COMMUNITY. RESIDENTIAL FACILITY OSCAR AND SO FOR ME THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE THAT'S WHY COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING IS INVOLVED IN THEIR OVERSIGHT BUT TYPICALLY RUN HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT AS THE PRIMARY ROLE OF COMMUNITY. CARE LICENSING IS HEALTH AND SAFETY SO THIS CERTAINLY FITS WITHIN THAT CAPS I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT PIECE OF IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND JUSTIN IF I'M A MANAGER. I WOULD WHEN THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE CAME AND TALKED TO ME -- HAVING JUST GONE THROUGH YOU KNOW TWO YEARS OF VISITING MY MOM AT A FACILITY AND HAVING MY YOU KNOW MY CHILDREN HANG OUT THERE YOU KNOW. I SAID WOW I I'D NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS AS AN ISSUE AND SO WHEN WE WERE DOING THE STORAGE I SAID LET'S JUST DO IT ALL TOGETHER AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND WHAT IT OPENS UP FOR ME HERE ARE ALL THE OTHER KINDS OF FACILITIES THAT FALL INTO CCL. NOT NOW I'M CURIOUS THANK YOU TRANSITIONAL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY THE MY COLLEAGUES. GREAT WE HAVE A MOTION -- SENATOR PORTANTINO YOU MAY CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. LET'S SEE A TO CALL. BUT THIS ONE YOUR ACCEPT THE MINUTES YEAH I AM IT'S AS AMENDED TO APPROACH. SKINNER HI IN OUR I A LOT. MORE LIKE I BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MITCHELL I'M AROUND. WIENER RIGHT WIENER AYE. EXCELLENT TO BILLS OUT. AND NOW AND WE HAVE YOUR NEXT BILL WHICH IS SB. THREE SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- PRESENTING SB THREE SEVEN SIX THAT WOULD REDEFINE INFREQUENT TO MEAN LESS THAN SIX FIREARMS TRANSACTIONS PER CALENDAR YEAR. REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF FIREARM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO SELL LEASE OR TRANSFER FIREARMS WITHOUT LEGALLY BEING REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE. THERE IS A DISPARITY IN THE PENAL CODE DEFINITION OF THE TERM INFREQUENT WHICH RESULTS IN A DISPARITY IN THE WAY IN WHICH I'M LICENSED SELLERS OF FIREARMS ARE TREATED UNDER THE LAW. INDIVIDUALS MAY OR MAY NOT BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE TO SELL FIREARMS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF FIREARM BEING TRANSACTED. IN SOME INSTANCES THIS MAY EXEMPT. FOR EXAMPLE NON PROFITS FROM HAVING TO GO THROUGH A LICENSED DEALER WHEN RALF LAYER AUCTIONING A FIREARM. THIS DISPARATE TREATMENT CAUSES CONFUSION AND MAKES IT UNCLEAR. IF AND WHEN SELLERS ARE REQUIRED TO AND SHOULD OBTAIN A LICENSE TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSINESS. TRANSACTION IN TRANSACTING pFOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF A BRIGHT LINE RULE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO STANDARDIZE THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM INFREQUENT. IT ALSO IS INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY. AND NUMBER OF FIREARMS IN INDIVIDUAL IS ALLOWED TO SELL OR MANUFACTURE ANNUALLY WITHOUT A LICENSE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD HAVE SOME LIMITS WITH WITHOUT A DOUBT. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A SINGLE LIMIT FOR THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND UNLICENSED INDIVIDUAL IS AFFORDED IN A YEAR REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF FIREARM BEING TRANSACTED. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WERE TRANSACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN A MIXTURE OF VARIOUS TYPES OF FIREARM. THE BILL. WOULD ALSO LIMIT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FIREARMS INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO SELL LEASE OR TRANSFER. TO NO MORE THAN FIFTY POR YOU PER YEAR WITHOUT HAVING TO OBTAIN A LICENSE THAT SEEMS REASONABLE TO ME. GOING FORWARD ON LICENSE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ABLE TO CONDUCT UP TO FIVE SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS AND SO LONG AS THE ANNUAL NUMBER OF FIREARMS TRANSACTED ARE LESS THAN. FIFTY THEY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO HAVE A LICENSE INDIVIDUALS BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE IF THEY ARE SELLING LEASING OR TRANSFERRING OR MANUFACTURING MORE THAN FIFTY FARMS YEAR. REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF FIREARM A NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE AMENDMENTS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING -- INDIVIDUALS MAY NEED TO TRANSACT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN FIVE TIMES OR MORE WITH A VOLUME OF FIFTY OVER A COURSE OF THE YEAR IF THEY FALL -- WITHOUT OBTAINING A LOT A LICENSE THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE. DEATH DIVORCE STORAGE EVEN TRIGGERING A PROBATION FROM OWNING A FIREARM OR WHEN A DEALER IS IN -- CURIOS OR RELICS SO THERE'S THERE'S WAS A ASH LONG DISCUSSION WITH THE O. J. ON WHERE TO APPROPRIATELY DRAW THESE LINES AND WE THINK WE HAVE. CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST STATE INSTITUTE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THESE CONNECTICUT REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL SELLING MORE THAN TEN HANDGUNS TO LET A LICENSE. MASSACHUSETTS GENTLY REQUIRES ANY INDIVIDUAL AND I KNOW. THAT SENATOR JACKSON LIT UP WHEN I SAID MASSACHUSETTS GENERALLY REQUIRES ANY INDIVIDUAL SELLING OR LEASING FIREARMS TO OBTAIN A LICENSE. THOUGH DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR SOME EXEMPTIONS TODAY I HAVE ACTUALLY AIRS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AND SPECIAL AGENT SUPERVISOR. LIKE GRAHAM -- FROM THE DOJ'S BUREAU FIREARMS AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH STAFF AND WITH THE DOJ ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU WILL HEAR FROM OUR WITNESSES. MY NAME IS ACTUALLY OR THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND WITH ME HERE TODAY IS ACTUALLY. NOW SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE PLATE GRAHAM WITH THE BUREAU FIREARMS ALSO PRESENT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS OUR DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU FIREARMS MARTIN HER AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY SHARING A FEW NUMBERS FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LAST YEAR THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED LICENSED GUN DEALERS. IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE ALSO APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EITHER OPERATING WITHOUT A LICENSE ENTIRELY OR WHO OPERATING OUTSIDE OF THE OP LIMITATIONS OF THEIR LICENSE. EACH OF THE THIRTEEN HARD INDIVIDUALS CONNECTED MORE THAN FIVE PRIVATE PARTY TRANSACTIONS IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOR THOSE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING HANDGUNS THE INDIVIDUALS INITIATING THE TRANSACTIONS. OR BLATANTLY VIOLATING THE LAW HOWEVER FOR THOSE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING LONG GUNS ARE MAKE SURE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FIREARMS LAW IS LESS CLEAR ON WHETHER THERE'S BEEN ANY KIND OF VIOLATION. NOW AS A SENATOR EXPLAINED THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF HOW THE PENAL CODE DEFINES THE TERM INFREQUENT. UNLICENSED DEALERS ARE ANNUALLY LIMITED TOO INFREQUENT FIREARMS TRANSACTIONS AN INFREQUENT HANDGUN TRANSACTIONS ARE LESS THAN FIVE YEAR BUT INFREQUENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ALL OTHER TYPES OF FIREARMS OR LONG GUNS. ARE PERMISSIBLE SO LONG AS THEY ARE OCCASIONAL AND WITHOUT REGULARITY. THIS AREA IS THE WITH ONE ISSUE SB THIRTY THREE SEVENTY SIX INTENSE REDRESS BY MODERNIZING THE TERM INFREQUENT. THE SECOND ISSUE SB THREE SEVEN SIX INTENDS TO ADDRESS IS THE UNLIMITED NUMBER OF FIREARMS PER TRANSACTION UNLICENSED DEALERS ARE ABLE TO SELL LEASE OR TRANSFER. THE BILL SOMEONE REPLIES EIGHT FIFTY LIMITATION TO THE MANUFACTURING OF FIREARMS WITHOUT A LICENSE AS WELL GOING FORWARD THE IDEA IS THAT UNLIKE SOME INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT UP TO FIVE TRANSACTIONS TOTAL INVOLVING NO MORE THAN FIFTY FIRE ANTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE TYPES. OF FIREARMS INVOLVED IS A HANDGUN OR A LONG TIME. AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE THE BILL SAYS THAT INDIVIDUALS WERE SELLING OR MANUFACTURING MORE THAN FIFTY FIRE IN THE YEAR SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE. THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE SAME SIZE. THE SAME STANDARDS THE SAME RECORDKEEPING STANDARDS IN THE SAME OVERSIGHT STANDARDS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO. ARE OPERATING WITH ALLIANCE WITH A LICENSE. WITH THESE NEW LIMITATIONS IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THE EXEMPTIONS REFERRED TO BY THE SENATOR AND NO WAY TO THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO OR WISH TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO DISPOSE LAWFULLY DISPOSE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF FIREARMS AS SUCH INCLUDED OR ARRAY OF EXEMPTIONS AND FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE DEALING IN DEATH DIVORCE THEY MAY BECOME PROHIBITED FROM OWNING FIREARMS. OR BECAUSE THEY'RE IN DEALING WITH CURIOS OR RELICS BECAUSE THEY'RE AN ANTIQUE DEALER. NOW AT THE PROBLEM CAUSED BY UNLICENSED DEALERS IS WHAT WAS VERY WELL ARTICULATED IN A RECENT ARTICLE SERIES BY CNN WORD INVESTIGATION INTO UNREGULATED SELL FIREARMS FOUND. UNLICENSED DEALERS FLAT THE NATION'S GUN LAWS AND PROVIDE A STEADY FLOW WEAPONS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EITHER BARRED FROM OWNING GUNS OR WANT GUNS IT CANNOT BE TRACED BACK TO THEM. INVESTED INVESTIGATION FOUND DEALERS ARE DIFFICULT TO DECK TO DETECT AN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE THE OFTEN RECEIVE LENIENT SENTENCES WHEN THEY ARE CONVICTED. THEY REVIEWED DOZENS OF CASES INCLUDING SOME OF WHICH SELLERS WERE WORN BY A TF THAT THEY MIGHT BE BROUGHT. BREAKING THE LAW BUT THEY CONTINUE TO SELL FIREARMS ANYWAY. GUNS THAT PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF A LICENSE DEALERS HAVE TURNED UP A CRIME SCENES AND IN POLICE INVESTIGATIONS FROM COAST TO COAST INCLUDING CASES OF ARMED ROBBERY CARJACKING AND MURDER. THE LOS FUZZINESS S FRUSTRATED EFFORTS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COMBAT THE PROBLEM OF UNLICENSED GUN DEALING IN AMERICA UNLICENSED DEALERS ARE GO TO SORTS OF VIRUS FOR CAMELS AND OTHERS WHO CAN'T PASS A SORT OF BACKGROUND CHECKS. THAT MAY BE REQUIRED ACCORDING TO THE C. N. N.'S INVESTIGATIONS LAST YEAR GUNS SOLD BY AN UNLICENSED DEALER WITH USE MUSCLING WHEN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER COMMANDER IN CHICAGO IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A GUN ALLEGEDLY SO BY SUSPECTED GUN DEALER IN NEVADA TO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WITH USE IN THE FATAL SHOOTING OF A CALIFORNIA SHERIFF'S DEPUTY AND THE WOUNDING OF TWO CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS. DESPITE THE IMPACT OF THEIR ILLICIT SALES COLONEL FILINGS AGAINST UNLICENSED DEALERS REPRESENT A SMALL FRACTION OF FIREARMS PROSECUTIONS AND RECEIVE COMPARATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE NATIONAL DEBATE ON GUNS. ON MY SINCE YOU LIVE REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT BUT NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THE STATE FOR SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR UNIFORM CONSISTENT REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF FIREARM. THE CHANGES PROPOSED OR INTENDED TO PROTECT AS WELL AS TO INFORM THE PUBLIC BY CLEARLY STANDARDIZING IF AND WHEN A PERSON IS A TYPE IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANKS ANY OTHER. ALL RIGHT -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE AND SENATOR PORTANTINO I'VE JUST COMMENTING HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER FOR SO LONG -- KATHY LYNCH REPRESENTING THE OUTDOOR SPORTSMAN'S COALITIONS FAR CLUB INTERNATIONAL AND CALIFORNIA'S SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY CERTAINLY WE WOULD CONCUR WITH MANY OF THE COMMENTS -- BEING MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE CERTAINLY HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT TIME -- LICENSED DEALERS OPERATE PROFESSIONALLY INCORRECTLY AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE ON LICENSE ACTIVITY PARTICULARLY IN THE MANUFACTURING AREA. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE ON THE LONG GUN ON AND SHOT GUN THE INFREQUENT. IS A STANDARD THAT HAS ACTUALLY WORKED AND I THINK WE'RE FORGETTING THAT THESE FOLKS STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH A WAITING PERIOD. THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE BACKGROUND CHECK -- AND SO THEY STILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE LAWS I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING BY CREATING THIS STANDARD YOU COULD BE DRIVING THE UNDERGROUND MARKET. I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE EXEMPTIONS WE HAVE FOR STATES BUT THE PERSON THAT MIGHT -- WANT TO DISPOSE OF THEIR FIREARMS ON BECAUSE THEY'RE MOVING OR THEY FALL ON HARD TIMES AGAIN THEY'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE LEGL PROCESS. BUT THIS SELF IMPOSED LIMITATION -- AS BURDENSOME PARTICULARLY IN THIS CATEGORY WHERE PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE MORE FIREARMS -- THE EXAMPLES THAT WERE USED WERE SPECIFIC TO HAND GUNS N TERMS OF LIMITATION AND NOT TO LONG GUN SO WITH THAT WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER -- OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEING NONE LET'S SEE IF THERE'S CALM ANSWER QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE. RIGHT SEEN -- NINE WE SENATOR JACKSON ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION AND CENTER PRINT PORTANTINO YOU MAY CLOSE -- THANKS THE DOJ IN STAFF -- FOR GETTING US THIS FAR AND RESPECT THE ASTRONOMICAL. EXCELLENT AND THIS ONE DOESN'T HAVE AMENDMENTS. ARE TO THE MOTION IS. DO YOU PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS -- AND WE WILL TAKE ROLL CALL. SKINNER HI THERE I MORE LACKEY BRADFORD. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE MITCHELL HI MITCHELL AYE MORALE. MORRELL NOW WIENER. WE'LL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE WILL NOW GO -- TO ITEM FOR SB ONE NINETY TWO SENATOR HERTZBERG [inaudible] YES [inaudible] WHICH ONE BUT IF YOU READY MANAGER [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. POSSE COMITATUS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS ABOUT. SO HERE'S THE STORY. WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SOME BILLS IN THE SENATE THIS YEAR. INTRODUCED IN OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED IN THE ASSEMBLY. THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT ALWAYS COMPLAIN THAT ALL WE DO IS PUT LAWS ON THE BOOKS WE NEVER TAKEN THE OFF. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO IN MY OFFICE IS I'VE GOT A NUMBER OF INTERNS FROM SENIORS TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. SENIOR CITIZENS TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND I HAD THEM SCRUB ALL TWENTY NINE CODES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LOOKING FOR STUFF THAT WE COULD FIND I'M LOOKING UP HERE AND I SEE MISTER DRAKE FRANCES DRAKE THAT WAS SOMETHING WE TRY TO LOOK AT THERE'S ALL THESE LAWS WE LOOKED AT EVERY TIME WE LOOK TO THE LAW WE FOUND SOME INTEREST GROUP. WANTED TO KEEP IT ON THE BOOKS. AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL ONE HERE I THINK THAT THERE IS NO BASIS TO HOLD THIS LAW. IT CONTINUE ON THE BOOKS IN THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO ELIMINATE THIS LAW. BASICALLY PENAL CODE SECTION ONE FIFTY MAKES IT A CRIME A CRIME FOR ANYONE OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN IN CALIFORNIA TO WILLFULLY OR NEGLIGENT REFUSED TO JOIN THE POSSE. AND IMPOSE A FINE OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS NOW UNDERSTAND OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS A THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT A THOUSAND DOLLARS. BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THESE CORD ASSESSMENTS FOR A ROLLING STOP IS THIRTY FIVE BUCKS BY THE TIME YOU GET STUCK WITH THE BILL IT'S FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS SO WE KNOW THAT. IT'S NOT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A TO DO THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE COST WOULD BE. THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL AND WE DID THE HOMEWORK FROM THIS EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO LAW. AND IT LITERALLY WAS PRESERVING THE PEACE ON THE WESTERN FRONT TIER IN APPREHENDING RUNAWAY SLAVES. SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT APPROPRIATE ANY LEVEL IN TERMS OF OUR CALIFORNIA LAW. AND SO TE ARGUMENT THAT'S BEING MADE OF COURSE IS WILL HIS SECOND YOU KNOW BY REMOVING THIS SECTION WE ARE NOT SAYING. THAT CITIZENS SHOULD NOT HELP THEIR FIRST RESPONDERS IN THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS WHEN OBLIGED BY EITHER STATUTORY OR MORAL DUTY. LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF THE MANY MANY CODE SECTIONS THAT IMPOSE THAT OBLIGATION BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS MAKING IT A CRIME NOT TO HELP. NOT WITH THIS A DUTY OR AND THE LIKE SO WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA GOOD SAMARITANS CODE IN THE HEALTH AND CODE PUT CO. SAFETY CODE SECTION SEVENTEEN NINETY NINE THAT SAYS NO PERSON WHO IN GOOD FAITH. AND NOT FOR COMPENSATION RENDITION EMERGENCY CARE AT THE SCENE OF AN EMERGENCY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CIVIL DAMAGES. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION TWENTY SIX SIX SO FOR THE SURE OF CHAU COMMAND THE EIGHT IT WAS MANY INHABITANTS OF THE SHIPS COUNTY IS HERE SHE THINKS. NECESSARY IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS OR HER DUTIES. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. FORTY ONE SIX OH TWO EVERY CITIZEN SHOT LEND AID WHEN REQUIRED IN THE ARREST OF OFFENDERS IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PUBLIC ORDER. PENAL CODE SECTION SEVEN TWENTY THREE WHEN ASSURE FURTHER PUBLIC OFFICER AUTHORIZED TO EX YOU PROCESS FINDS THAT RESISTANCE WE MADE TO THE EXECUTION OF PROCESS. THE OFFICER MAY COMMAND AS MANY ABLE BODIED HABITANTS OF THE OFFICERS COUNTY IS HERE SHE MAY THINK IT'S PROPER TO ASSIST. JUST A COUPLE MORE PENAL CODE SECTION SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN IF A PERSON IS ASSEMBLED. IF THE PERSON'S ASSEMBLY NOT IMMEDIATELY DISPERSED SUCH MAGISTRATES AND OFFICERS MAY ARREST THEM AND TO THE AND THEY COMMAND THE EIGHT OF PERSONS PRESENT WITHIN THE COUNTY. THE CODE SECTION. EIGHT THIRTY NINE ANY PERSON MAKING ARRESTS MAY ORALLY SUMMONSES MANY PERSONS AS THE PERSON'S DEEMS NECESSARY TO AID THEM THERE IN. AND PEOPLE CODE SECTION FIFTEEN FIFTY EVERY PIECE OFFICER OTHER PERSON IN POWER TO MAKE AN ARREST YEAR UNDER SHOP THE SAME AUTHORITY INTERESTING YOU CUES TO COMMAND ASSISTANCE THEREFORE. AS PERSONS DESIGNATED SECTION. ONE FIFTY I TRIED HARD TO FIND A LAW THAT WE COULD JUST TAKE OFF THE BOOKS. I THINK THIS IS ONE THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO MAKE IT A CRIME -- CERTAINLY THERE IS THROUGHOUT THE COLDNESS MANY OTHER CODE SECTIONS I COULDN'T FIND VERY MANY CASES WE SCRUB THE THE CASE AUTHORITY LOOKING FOR ANY TIME THIS LAW WAS ACTUALLY USED. AND WE FOUND ONE CASE WHAT WAS USED FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS. BROUGHT IN IT WASN'T ABOUT THE LIABILITY WAS ABOUT THEM SUING THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY GET KILLED IN HELPING THE OFFICERS MAKE THE ARREST. TODAY WE A PROFESSIONAL POLICE% OFFICERS AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF THE LIKE IT IS CERTAINLY WE CAN FIND NO REASONABLE BASIS TO MAINTAIN THIS LAW ON THE BOOKS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. PART THREE OF ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE HAD A WITNESS BUT WE GOT SORT OF AS WE I'M SORRY WE HAVE SOME REAL HARD MORNING WE GOT PLAN THEY DON'T EVER SPEAK THE LINE BACK.

GOOD MORNING AT MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION -- WE MESS I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE AUTHOR AND WE COME IN OPPOSITION TO DISPEL -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- WE REALLY UNFAMILIAR WITH ANY CONCERNS WITH DISPATCH IT OTHER THAN IT WAS ENACTED MANY YEARS AGO. AND THAT IF WE AN ACT IS A LEGISLATION THAT IS PROPOSED THAT IT WILL DISCOURAGE BYSTANDERS FUN NOT HELPING OUT IN TIME OF A PUBLIC SAFETY NEED -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK THAT YOU OPPOSE I YOU VOTE NO ON THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY COMMITTEE [inaudible] SENATOR MOORLACH. DOES THIS MEAN I CAN PROUDLY SEW MY HORSE. OR I DON'T HAVE TO BUY ONE LIKE IT IS. ALRIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION -- CENTER HERTZBERG I THINK YOU CLOSED I DID GOOD. LET'S TO ROLL CALL. MOTIONS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER BY IN OUR AYE MOORLACH. MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD. JACKSON FIVE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MITCHELL AYE MOREAU. WELL I WINNER. BOULDER OPEN BUT I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I GOT TO VOTE ON SOMETHING TO ELIMINATE A VOTE ON A BILL TO ELIMINATE A BILL -- BUT OBJECTIVE HERE ALRIGHT SO WE WILL HOLD THAT ROLE OPEN. THANK YOU AND I THINK THANK YOU SO AN ITEM SO NOW WE WILL GO -- TO SENATOR HILL -- WITH SB TWO TWENTY NO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- SB TWO TWENTY WILL STRENGTHEN THE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS OF RETAILERS. SB TWO TWENTY WILL STRENGTHEN SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AT FIREARMS RETAILERS TO HELP PREVENT FIRE ON THEFT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE COMMITTEE APPROVED AS BEFORE SIXTY FOR A BROADER VERSION OF THIS POLICY. THAT BILL WAS THE WINNER MIGHT THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW CONTEST SUBMITTED BY A CONSTITUENT AFTER BURGLARS USED A CAR TO RAM INTO A GUN STORE IN MY DISTRICT. THE ROBBERS BROKE IN ON A SUNDAY MORNING AND STOLE AN UNDISCLOSED NUMBER OF GUNS LEFT IN THEIR GLASS DISPLAY CASES. THIS WAS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT AND THESE TYPES OF BURGLARIES ARE ON THE RISE THE A TF TOLD MY OFFICE THAT AT LEAST ELEVEN OTHER SIMILAR SMASH AND GRAB ROBBERIES TOOK PLACE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN INCLUDING ANOTHER IN MY DISTRICT. SIMILAR SMASH AND GRAB FIREARM DEATHS HAVE OCCURRED MORE RECENTLY IN LUIS FAIRFIELD STOCKTON AND DICTION. BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN GUN STORE BURGLARIES INCREASED BY 71% IN CALIFORNIA AND OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED GUNS WERE STOLEN. IT WILL ESTABLISH A STOLEN GUNS ARE OFTEN USED TO COMMIT CRIMES SEVERAL ROBBERIES HAVE INVOLVED THE USE OF A CAR AS A BATTERING RAM IN MANY INSTANCES THE GUNS WERE LEFT. UNSECURED OVERNIGHT IN THEIR DISPLAY CASES. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IS BE TO TWENTY UPDATES THE CURRENT ECURITY STANDARD FOR GUN STORES. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HOSTED A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH GUN STORE OWNERS TO SEE IF WE CAN MAKE THE BILL MORE FLEXIBLE AS A RESULT WE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF SECURITY OPTIONS FROM. TWO TO SIX PROVIDING IMPROVE COMPLIANCE OPPORTUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY EACH GUN STORE MUST COMPLY WITH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING SIX SECURITY OPTIONS WHEN STORE IN THEIR GUNS WHILE THE STORE IS CLOSED. LOCK THE GUNS IN A SAFE LOCK THEM WITH A STEEL CABLE AND INSTALL BOLLARDS IN FRONT OF THE STORE OR LOCKED THE GUNS BEHIND STEEL ROLL DOWN DOORS OR GATE. OR LOCK THE GUNS IN A GUN RACK WITH A LOCKING STEEL BAR. THEY COULD ALSO LOCKED THE GUNS IN A WINDOW WINDOWLESS SECURE ROOM FOR INSTALL STEEL ROLL DOWN DOORS AND ALL DOORS AND FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOWS. OR LOCK THE GUNS IN A GUN CABINET MADE WITH STEEL AND POLYCARBONATE SHEETS WE ALSO DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION BY SIX MONTHS TO GIVE TIME FOR STORAGE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. IT'S APPARENT FROM MY MEETINGS AT MANY SHORE GUNNED. MANY GUN STORES ARE ALREADY IN COMPLIANCE WITH AT LEAST ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS AND AS A RESULT I THINK THIS BILL WILL IMPACT A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF STORES. I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH GUN STORE OWNERS ON THE AMENDMENTS BUT YOU MAY HEAR THAT SOME DEALERS REMAIN OPPOSED. WELL I BELIEVE WE BROUGHT GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO THE BILL THERE WERE A FEW ISSUES WE COULDN'T RESOLVE FOR EXAMPLE. IT WAS REQUESTED THAT I ELIMINATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXISTING AUTHORITY TO ADOPT THEIR OWN REGULATIONS. HOWEVER THIS LOCAL AUTHORITY HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT OF THIS BILL TO UNDERMINE THAT LOCAL CONTROL I THINK IT'S B.. TWO TWENTY PUTS FORWARD A REASONABLE AND FLEXIBLE SOLUTION TO A REAL PROBLEM. AND I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL. IS SUPPORTED BY THE BRADY CAMPAIGN BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISION GIFFORD TO LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. YOU HAVE A WITH THIS MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR -- YES AMANDA YOU MAY PROCEED THIS WILL **** AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA AT A RIGHT -- FIREARMS TOLD HIM BALK FROM LICENSED FIREARM DEALERS SEEMS TO BE AN ESCALATING PROBLEM. I CERTAINLY BEEN COVERED BY YOU HEARD FROM THE SENATOR AND THERE'S BEEN VARIOUS NEWS REPORTS. THIS HAPPENED IN OUR MY OWN COMMUNITY UP IN NEVADA COUNTY WORK ON STORE RIGHT NEXT NEIGHBORHOOD SOMEONE DROVE THE CAR THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GOT A BUNCH OF GUNS AND IT REALLY SHOOK UP THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS WELL AS OUR RURAL COMMUNITY. SO IT IS A PROBLEM IT SEEMS TO BE ESCALATING PROBLEMS YOU KNOW BRADY CAMPAIGN SCHEME. IN THEM. KEY GOAL IS TO KEEP FIREARMS OUT OF PAINTERS HANDS INTO EXTENT THAT -- GUNS ARE REQUIRED. THROUGH FAT FROM A GUN STORE AND THEN MAKE THEIR WAY INTO DANGEROUS HANDS PUBLIC SAFETY IS -- CERTAINLY THREATENED BY THAT. FIND I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE SPILL OVER THE YEARS I KNOW THAT THE SENATOR HAS WORKED WITH -- WITH FIREARM DEALERS TO COME UP WITH MORE WORKABLE SOLUTIONS FOR THEM -- I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT THE STORAGE OPTIONS ARE THAT ARE -- LISTED IN THIS BILL WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY ONE TIME COSTS FOR THE DEALERS I THINK THAT WOULD BE MANAGEABLE THEM FOR THEM -- AND I THINK THIS IS A TO AGAIN ADDRESSING AN ESCALATING PROBLEM IN OUR STATE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JERMAINE SAID. CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING DANIEL CANNOT BECAUSE OUR BEHALF THE GIFFORDS LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE IN STRONG SUPPORT. JIM WHEN BURKE ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING DOMINIQUE NON FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SENATOR HILL -- I REPRESENT THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION -- REPRESENTING MANUFACTURE RETAILING DISTRIBUTORS THROUGHOUT THE U. S. IN CALIFORNIA WEBER THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA FIRST WHEN IT KNOWLEDGE -- CENTER HEALTH FOR THE PAST WORK THAT WE HAVE WORKED WITH HIM DIRECTLY ON THE BILL AND MANY OF THE THINGS HE OUTLINED IN HIS OPENING COMMENTS. ARE REFLECTIVE OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS -- ON AS BEFORE SIXTY FOUR IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US -- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT -- WE DO HAVE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE MAJOR -- I THINK SENATOR HELL ACTUALLY STARTED TO FRAME IT UP ON THE LOCAL CONTROL OF VERSUS THE STATE MANDATE YES THOSE LOCAL ORDINANCES HAPPEN ON THE BOOK BECAUSE THEY ARE CUSTOMIZED FOR THE RETAIL OPERATIONS THAT EXIST -- FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN IN -- THE ROSEVILLE AREA BASS PRO SHOPS ONE TO BEEN ABLE -- UNDER THE PRIOR CONFIGURATION OF THE BILL TO EVEN SERVICE IT'S BOATS BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS. SENATOR HILL DID ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A STATE. A STATE LAW ON TOP OF LOCAL ORDINANCES AND YOU PROVIDE NO CLEAR GUIDANCE FOR THE RETAILER THEY CAN BE CAUGHT IN A CATCH -- TWENTY TWO IT ALSO INDICATES THAT THE LICENSING ENTITY MAY -- YOU KNOW GRANT AN EXEMPTION IF THEY'RE GET CAUGHT IN SUCH A CONFLICT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY PRESCRIPTIVE SO THAT YOU ARE GRANTED -- THE AUTHORIZATION IF YOU'RE IN CONFLICT IT CREATES KIND OF A CHILLING EFFECT ON BUSINESS THIS COULD BE -- I'M I KNOW SENATOR HILLS INTENTIONS ARE VERY GOOD BUT THIS COULD BE USED IN A WAY -- THAT COULD BE USED TO DERIVE THOSE BUSINESSES OUT OF A JURISDICTION BY THE STATE LOBBYING IN PLACE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT EVEN MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO WE BE LOOKING FOR THE STATE STANDARD TO BE THE THRESHOLD THEN THAT COULDN'T BE EXCEEDED. AND THEN -- LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- I THINK TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT WAS REFERENCED -- WITH THE SMASHING GRABS I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT. THE FBI HAS INDICATED THAT THOSE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN DROPPING AND I DID PROVIDE I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE A REPORT ON SOME OF THE THE VIOLENT CRIMES INCLUDING THE SMASHING GROUPS WHICH HAVE DROPPED OFF. AND LASTLY THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION IS VERY COMMITTED TO THIS AND WE PROVIDE OUR OWN SECURITY PLANS IN TRAINING. FOR DEALERS -- WE ARE WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL AGENCIES WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. TO TRY TO REACH EVERY RETAILER AGAIN THESE ARE VALUABLE PRODUCTS AND ON NO BUSINESS WANTS TO LOOSE MERCHANDISE THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WERE RIGHT GRIFFIS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION THE NRA GUNNERS A CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK AND CONGRESSIONAL SPORTSMAN'S FOUNDATION CAL DEAR. NATIONAL TURKEY FEDERATION AND MANY OTHERS WE STILL FEEL STRONGLYTHAT IS A KNEE JERK REACTION THOSE LOCALIZED CRIMES THOSE WAS ONE CRIME RING THAT WAS FOUND TO BE RESPONSE FOR THE MAJORITY THOSE INCIDENTS. WHEN WILL REMIND YOU THAT THIS IS THIS BILL WOULD DEVASTATE SMALL BUSINESSES SINCE MANY SMALL COMMUNITIES WHETHER KEY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY COMING IN FROM? RECREATIONAL HUNTERS AND AND SPORTSMEN COMING INTO LAW SHOPS. AND LASTLY JUST A REMINDER THIS THIS BILL WAS VETOED TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY -- GOVERNOR BROWN AND AND IT LEFT A PRETTY STRONG VETO MESSAGE THAT THIS WOULD BE BEST LEFT IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL. GOVERNMENT AND NOT HAVING THIS OVERLAPPING. PROBLEM THAT MY COLLEAGUE ALREADY OUTLINED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND WE STAND A STRONG OPPOSITION OF THIS BILLS IS [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HER RIGHT ARM AND I HAVE A COMMENT BEFORE A SEE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES -- AS CENTER WHO WILL ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU ON DID NOT TAKE A AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HAVE LEFT IT TO LOCAL JURISDICTION AND THE REASON I RAISE THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT IN OUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- WE WERE PROVIDED SOME DETAIL OF THE NUMBER OF BASICALLY OF ROBBERIES -- SMASHING GRAB ROBBERIES OF GUN SHOPS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE LIST THAT WE HAVE IS JUST. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ALONE THERE'S QUITE A NUMBER LISTED. SO AND I KNOW THAT WE SUPPORTED THIS BILL IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT. SO IF IF THIS WERE NOT AN OCCURRENCE. THEN -- PERHAPS SOMEONE COULD LEGITIMATELY SAY WELL SHOULD JUST BE LEFT UP TO EACH LOCAL JURISDICTION BUT BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT ITS ACROSS MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. SEEMS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO TAKE THESE KIND OF SAFETY MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE THE FIRE ARMS ARE PROPERLY SECURED SO APPRECIATE YOUR OTHER I THINK ANOTHER ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES REFERENCE TENACITY TO A PREVIOUS -- AUTHOR BUT PREACHING YOUR TENACITY FOR BRINGING IT BACK -- ANY OF THE COMMENTS WERE QUESTIONS BY. MY COLLEAGUES. RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION. SENATOR HILL YOU WANT -- TO CLINKING MANAGER THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I MEAN THIS IS JUST BASICALLY ABOUT SECURING FIREARMS AND IN REALLY THAT SWEET. THREE TO FOUR MINUTES OF PROTECTION SO THAT WHEN SOMEONE SMASHES INTO THAT CLASS THEY CAN'T GET IN AND GRABBING THREE DIDN'T AND REACH INTO THOSE GLASS CABINET SIMPLE THOSE GUNS OUT IN AND TAKEN BEFORE LAW ENFORCEMENT ARISE BECAUSE THEY GET THERE. QUICKLY BECAUSE OF CERTAINLY THE THE TYPE OF MATERIALS ARE RESPECT YEAH SURE I'VE OF MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- WE HAVE A MOTION LET'S DO A ROLL CALL. MOTIONS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MORLOCK [inaudible] BRADFORD. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MORALE. AROUND OUR WINNER. OUR WILL HOLD SEVERAL OPEN AND WE'LL GO TO YOUR NEXT BILL WHICH IS SB THREE SIXTY BECAUSE YOU'RE SB TWO TWO ONE IS ON CONSENT. AS A MANAGER I JUST WANT TO REFLECT FOR ONE SECOND ON THIS BE TO TWENTY ONE BEING ON CONSENT. IT IS A FIRST FOR ME IN THIS COMMITTEE EVER TO HAVE A BILL ON CONSENT SO. MUCH. LOVE TO KEEP PEOPLE. TO TAKE A MOMENT FOR NINETEEN NEVER ONE YOU -- IT -- HAVE PEOPLE ASSUME -- LIKE TO DASH EXPECTATIONS GO AHEAD SENATOR WILL MOVE TO THE SPEED. THREE SIXTY SB THREE SIXTY RECALL HE ASKED US TO PULL IT FROM. THAT THE YOU MISUNDERSTOOD. IF YOU WERE OF APRIL FOOLS DAY MAYBE WE WOULD'VE BUT GO AHEAD -- SB THREE SIXTY REQUIRES CLERGY TO REPORT SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT EVEN IF THEY ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE FOR SUSPICION DURING A PENITENTIAL COMMUNICATION. CLERGY ARE ARE ALREADY MANDATED A CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT REPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WOULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BY HOLDING THEM TO THE SAME STANDARD AS THE OTHER FORTY FIVE MANDATED REPORTERS LISTED IN STATUTE. AS MANDATED CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT REPORTERS DOCTORS PSYCHIATRISTS THERAPISTS AND OTHERS HAVE TO BREAK. CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND REPORT SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT WITHOUT EXCEPTION. BUT UNDER EXISTING LAW CLERGY CAN LAWFULLY IGNORE SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT IF THEY ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE DURING A CONVERSATION THAT IS INTENDED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL. CHILD ABUSE IS CLEARLY STILL A PRESSING ISSUE IN FAITH INSTITUTIONS LAST THURSDAY. A PRIEST WAS ARRESTED IN THE BAY AREA ON SUSPICION OF THIRTY COUNTS OF CHILD SEX ABUSE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND ON FRIDAY. POPE FRANCIS ISSUED A DECREE MAKING IT MANDATORY. FOR VATICAN VATICAN CITY OFFICIALS TO IMMEDIATELY REPORT ABUSE ALLEGATIONS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE TRAILBLAZING WITH THIS MEASURE. CONNECTICUT INDIANA MISSISSIPPI NEBRASKA NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW JERSEY NORTH CAROLINA OKLAHOMA RHODE ISLAND TENNESSEE TEXAS AND WEST VIRGINIA. ALREADY HAVE SIMILAR STATUTES THE OPERATE UNDER THE SAME CONSTITUTION AND THE SAME BILL OF RIGHTS THAT WE DO. AND WE HAVE FOUND NO LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE STATUTE IN THOSE STATES IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO PUT CHILDREN FIRST I DO HAVE WITNESSES MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HELD WE HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MY NAME'S CAM IN TAURUS AB SURVIVOR [inaudible] AND IN A THEY ALL STARTED WITH MY MOTHER SHE WAS. BORN AND RAISED IN SAN FRANCISCO INTO INTO AN ABUSIVE FAMILY BACKGROUND. AND IN HER EARLY TWENTIES SHE WAS RECRUITED INTO THE JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES. AT THIS ROUND THE SAME TIME AS SHE BECAME PREGNANT WITH ME. THEY CONVINCED HER THAT SATAN THE DEVIL CONTROL THE ENTIRE WORLD. INCLUDING HER FAMILY. SO SHE RAN AWAY. WITH ME. WHERE I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN A SMALL TOWN WITH NOTHING BUT JONES WITNESSES? AN INTERNATIONAL AID I WAS RAISED IN A GOD FEARING FAMILY SO I I LOVE HER AND I WANT TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT IN GOD'S EYES. TO REALLY EARLY AGE AROUND SIX I WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY A MAN IN THE CAR ASIAN. HE WAS REALLY REALLY CLOSE TO THE FAMILY SO THEY TRUSTED HIM. BUT MY MOTHER SUSPECTED SOMETHING WAS UP. SOMETHING IS WRONG SO SHE ASKED ME AND THEN WENT TO THE ELDERS. WE CONFIRM THAT THEY TOLD HER. IT'S IN GOD'S HANDS NOW. DON'T SPEAK ABOUT IT. WE'LL LOOK INTO IT AND WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT FOR FEAR OF AGAINST SATAN THE DEVIL TRYING TO ATTACK THE ONE TRUE RELIGION. SO NOTHING HAPPENED. AND A FEW YEARS LATER. HAPPEN AGAIN WITH A DIFFERENT MAN [inaudible] IN A TO THE SAME THING. DON'T SPEAK ABOUT IT IT'S IN GOD'S HANDS. AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT SO THESE TWO MEN I HAD TO GROW UP WITH STARING AT AS ABUSERS. AND THEY'RE STILL LOOSE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION IS TO THE TATE WITH. HIGHER POSITIONS IN THIS ROUND OF EIGHT CHILDREN ALL THE TIME. SO IS UP UNTIL ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THAT I REALIZED THAT I'D BEEN LIED TO MY ENTIRE LIFE. NONE OF THAT I GREW UP IN A COLD. AND THAT THEY WERE HIDING THOUSANDS OF SEX ABUSE CASES. THIS THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. FOR ALL RELIGIONS GOVERNMENTS BUSINESSES. THIRTY PENITENT PRIVILEGES BEEN AROUND FOR THE LAST HUNDRED PLUS YEARS. THIS WILL COST THE STATE LESS MONEY FOR HAVING TO REHABILITATE PEOPLE WHO TURN TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND OTHER USES WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE AN OUTLET. SB THREE SIXTY AIMS AND THIS CONTENT CLERGY [inaudible] PRIVILEGE. AND HAVE MANDATORY REPORTING. I THINK IT'S TIME THAT. THE UNIVERSE IS TELLING US TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU.

YEAH MEDI HIRE FROM CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY -- JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY STATE THAT -- WE FOLLOW THE NO HARM PRINCIPLE WE DON'T FEEL THE STATE HAS ANY RIGHT TO REGULATE. FOUGHT OR BELIEVE BUT WHEN -- PEOPLE ACT ON THOSE BELIEFS AND THEIR CONDUCT -- OVER STEPS OTHER PEOPLE'S RIGHTS WE FEEL THAT -- THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF ONE CEASE WHERE ANOTHER NEIGHBOR'S FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS BEGAN.

AND I SEE IT CONTINUOUSLY HAPPENING. I'M HONORED THAT THAT WAS ASKED TO COME DOWN HERE. AND I WAS INVITED. TO TO SPEAK IN BEHALF OF THIS.

WHO HAVE BEEN ABUSED BY TEACHERS I'VE SEEN THE THE EFFECTS THAT IT'S HAD ON CHILDREN FOR YEARS? I HAVE FRIENDS OUTSIDE OF THE ORGANIZATION WHO WERE ABUSED AS CHILDREN. BETTER TURN TO PROSTITUTION DRUGS I'VE SEEN THE DAMAGE IS DONE TO CHILDREN HOW HARD IT IS FOR THEM TO SURVIVE. THE COST IT HAS MADE TO SOCIETY. I'VE SEEN THE STATISTICS WERE ONLY 30% 20% REPORTED THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT ARE NOT REPORTED IT'S AFFECTED SOCIETY FOR A LONG TIME. I AM CURRENTLY THE SECRETARY TREASURER OF SCARS WE STARTED AN ORGANIZATION TO STOP CHILD ABUSE ADVOCATES FOR REFORM SAFETY WE WE THOUGHT THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE SOCIETY AND HELP SOCIETY WOULD BE TO CHANGE LAWS. AND CHANGE CULTURE THE WAY PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT WE WANT CHILDREN TO BE HAPPY AND FREE TO GO REPORTED AND TO BE CONGRATULATED.

VIEWS OF CHILDREN [inaudible] HAPPENS BECAUSE EITHER THE CHILD IS IN A SETTING WHERE THEY FEEL THEY CANNOT. TELL. OR THERE OR THEY DO TELL AND IT'S NEVER REVEALED IT ALLOWS THE VIEWS TO GO ON SO. WE APPLAUD YOUR COURAGE AND I WAS I AM. AN ABUSE SURVIVOR. AFTER YEARS OF ABUSE. I DID NOT I WAS NOT ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT IT PUBLICLY UNTIL ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO. SO IT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND I REALLY APPLAUD YOU AND NOW WE WILL TAKE THE WITNESSES IN. OPPOSITION. MAGIC MANAGER IN. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KEVIN SNYDER -- UP WITH PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE A CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY WHERE I SERVED AS CHIEF COUNSEL. IN MY CAPACITY AS AN ATTORNEY MUCH OF MY PRACTICE IS FOCUSED ON ADVISING A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR CLERGY. THE BILL BEFORE YOU SIX TO IMPOSE CRIMINAL PENALTIES OF SIX MONTHS IN JAIL ON A MEMBER OF THE CLERGY. FOR REFUSING TO BREAK THE SEAL OF CONFESSION. PRIVATE RELIGIOUS COUNCIL TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS CONFESSION IS A MILLENNIA OLD. RELIGIOUS PRACTICE IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRACTICES THE SACRAMENTS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. BUT IS ALSO PART OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICES OF THE EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCH. THE PROTESTANT REFORMED TRADITION IS FOUND IN THE LUTHERAN EPISCOPAL IN PRESBYTERIAN CHURCHES. OTHER CHURCHES ALSO HAVE CONFESSION AS PART OF THEIR RELIGIOUS PRACTICES SUCH AS THE AMERICAN BAPTIST METHODIST LATTER DAY SAINTS IN CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY. ANECDOTALLY IN PROVIDING LEGAL COUNSEL -- TO PASTORS I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT HALF OF EVANGELICAL FUNDAMENTALISTS IN PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES MAINTAIN STRICT CONFIDENCES. SUCH THAT THEY WILL NOT REPORT CONFESSION OF CRIMES NOR WILL THEY TESTIFY IN COURT IF SUBPOENAED. BY REMOVING THE CLERGY PENITENT PRIVILEGE SUCH REQUIRES CLERGY TO SAIL BETWEEN THE SOLO. AND GROUP THIS THEY MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN CRIMINAL LIABILITY OR SPIRITUAL PERIL. FAILURE TO IMMEDIATELY BRING IN THE POLICE SUBJECTS MINISTERS TO PROSECUTION IN JAIL. BUT DISCLOSING VIOLATES THE RELIGIOUS PRACTICES IN A SACRED TRUST. THE BILL OF RIGHTS IN OUR CONSTITUTION. IS A SECULAR DECALOGUE FEW WELL. IS A LIST OF DO'S AND DON'TS. DIRECTED AT THE GOVERNMENT. PASSAGE OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU WOULD BREAK THE FIRST CLAUSE OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT IF YOU WILL. THE RELIGION CLAUSE PROVIDES THAT NO LAW CAN BE PASSED THAT PROHIBITS THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION. PLACING CLERGY IN A POSITION SUCH THAT THEY WILL BE CORD BY ONE OR THE OTHER OF TWO FORMS OF A DILEMMA. IS PRECISELY WHAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT FORBIDS. JUST AS CONGRESS RIGHTLY EXEMPTED CLERGY FROM THE MILITARY DRAFT SO TO THIS BODY SHOULD HAVE THE PRUDENCE TO NOT CONSCRIPT MINISTERS INTO THE RANKS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE WELL OVER FORTY CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED AT THE SERVICE OF THE STATE. IN RELATION TO REPORTING CSE SUSPICIONS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT. CHURCH SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A TOOL OF THE STATE MADAM CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR DELIBERATION ON THIS MATTER. YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY AND I URGE MEMBERS TO VOTE NAY. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YES PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS SANDRA REVERSE. AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE AND I AM HERE TO EXPRESS THE BISHOPS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AND OFFER MYSELF AS A AS A PERSON TO TALK TO AS TO WHY WE WOULD BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. IN THE ME FIRST START BY SAYING IT IS A SELF DEFEATING BILL AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE OPPOSE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM YES SENATOR JACKSON'S. YES -- TO THE ATTORNEY -- WHO'S HERE ASIDE MENTIONED EARLIER WITH RESPECT TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WE HAVE NO AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ON RESTRICTED AND ON QUALIFIED AND CERTAINLY THE FIRST AMENDMENT IN TERMS OF FREEDOM. OF RELIGION. WE DO HAVE LAWS PROHIBITING BIGAMY. AND THOSE ARE -- CONTRARY TO SERVICE CERTAIN RELIGIOUS GROUPS SO THERE IS NO AMENDMENT THAT IS WITHOUT SOME RESTRICTIONS -- IN I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT. THE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT -- WE HAVE HAD. A PLAGUE AN EPIDEMIC. OF EXCUSES AND CLAIMS OF RELIGION. WHICH HAVE ALLOWED PER FILES. AND ABUSERS. TO EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY IN THIS WORLD -- UNFETTERED. FOR FAR TOO LONG. AND THE NOTION THAT TO A TALKING ABOUT AT THE SERVICE OF THE STATE I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT IT IS IMMORAL AND AGAINST GOD'S WILL FOR PEOPLE TO ABUSE CHILDREN. AND I THINK IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE TO DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT DOES NOT CONTINUE. I THINK WE WOULD BE REMISS IN OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO ACCEPT ANY CLAIM THAT RELIGION. AND MAY I ADD MANMADE RELIGION. SUPERSEDES THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE ALL -- CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR IN OUR SOCIETY SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT TO YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT. IS OUTDATED -- THIS WAS MENTIONED THERE ARE MANY OTHER STATES WHERE THIS HAS TAKEN PLACE WITHOUT REPERCUSSION. THAT THE STATE THE PEOPLE DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT CERTAIN PRACTICES THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE INAPPROPRIATE IMMORAL. OF AND TO A CERTAINLY TO US GIVE A PASS BECAUSE SOMEONE GOES IN AND CONFESSES BEHAVIOR THAT IS OFFENSIVE. TO MANKIND AND PROBABLY TO GOD BUT I'LL LET GOD MAKE THAT DECISION -- I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW. OF THE WEATHER -- WHETHER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE BUT I SUSPECT. EVEN THE NOTION OF GOOD AND EVIL AND GOD BEING GOOD AND THE DEVIL BEING EVIL. THAT -- IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THAT RELIGIOUS DISCUSSION THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE WOULD LAND ON GOD'S SIDE IN THE SIDE OF GOOD. BUT WE ARE A WE ARE A SOCIETY WE ARE GOVERNED BY LAWS WE ARE GOVERNED BY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE WHAT IS MORALLY CORRECT. AND WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SOCIETY AND I WOULD SUBMIT. HAVING ACCEPTING AND CONDONING ALLOWING THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR TO CONTINUE ON A CLAIM OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM I THINK IS ANATHEMA. TO EVERYTHING WE HOLD DEAR AND I HOPE IT IS ANATHEMA TO EVERYTHING THAT HOLE WE HOLD DEAR SO FIRST AMENDMENT. ON NOT UNLIMITED SECOND MOMENT NOT UNLIMITED WE ARE A SOCIETY OF HUMAN BEINGS AND WE TRY TO PROTECT OURSELVES IN EACH OTHER'S BEST WE CAN. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND WITH THANK THE WITNESSES FOR COMING FORWARD I'M SURE THIS WAS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO BUT THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. AND WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU A MOTION CENTER MORE LACKEY. THANK YOU MADAM. MISTER SNYDER I JUST WANNA. SAY THAT WE'VE EXEMPTED PENITENTIAL COMMUNICATION. WHEN IT WAS FIRST ADDRESSED BACK IN? NINETY SEVEN BUT WE STILL HAVE FAILURES. SO WHAT IS THE WHAT IS YOUR WHAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION. BECAUSE I I I APPRECIATE. YOUR ARGUMENT BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE. WHAT WAS JUST STATED NO WITH WHERE WE FIND THE BALANCE THAT WE STOP? CERTAIN ACTIVITIES IN ORGANIZED RELIGION [inaudible] WELCOME. THE PENITENT CLERGY PRIVILEGE IS VERY NARROW IT'S WHEN SOMEONE. GOES TO A MINISTER IN PRIVATE FOR PENITENTIAL PURPOSES COMMUNICATES IN CONFESSES THAT IT IS NOT DEALING WITH ECCLESIASTICAL BOARDS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A PRIEST. GOES BEFORE A A TRIBUNAL OF HIS OWN -- DENOMINATION -- THAT THAT GROUP IS NOT COVERED BY THE PENITENT. CLERGY PENITENT PRIVILEGE AND SO THE MAN SO THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ALREADY -- IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES ARE COVERED BY THIS AND SO THE BUT THE THE I'M SO I DON'T BELIEVE. BROADENING THAT. IN TWO AREAS THAT ARE A SACRAMENT OF THE CHURCH -- I THINK THAT IS ANATHEMA THAT SUPPOSEDLY IS A DEEP A PROBLEM IN THE AND AND THE NOTION THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS UPDATED -- IS A IS THIS IS A IS A TROUBLING STRUGGLING STATEMENT COMING FROM THIS BODY WELL EXCUSE ME IF I MAY NOBODY SAID THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS UPDATED WE SAID IT IS NOT UNLIMITED. AND YOU IS AN ATTORNEY I AM SURE KNOW THAT VERY WELL SO PLEASE DO NOT MISCONSTRUE MY STATEMENTS. THEY'RE MORE LIKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF MR WITH THE CITY COMMENTS YEAH. THE FIRST COMMENT I WOULD MAKE IS -- I WAS SURPRISED BY MISTER HILL PRESENTER HILLS -- PRESS STATEMENT LISTING ALL THE STATE'S -- AS THE FORMER -- KATHY CONFERENCE DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE OF TEXAS -- I DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY PLACE WHERE ANY STATE WHERE -- THE PENITENTIAL COMMUNICATION RIGHT WASN'T PROTECTED AND IN SPEAKING TO THE OTHER DIRECTORS -- I WAS TOLD THAT THEY ARE STILL PROTECTED TO THE STATE THE ONLY STATE THAT I KNOW OF THE DOESN'T HAVE THE PROTECTION IS TEXAS IT NEVER HAPPENS. BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING -- AT LEAST THE TIME THAT I LIVED IN TEXAS THAT THAT -- THE PENITENTIAL. COMMUNICATIONS WERE HONORED AND RESPECTED -- THE OTHER THING I WOULD RESPOND WITH IN IN TERMS OF HOW THE PENITENTIAL PROTECTION WORKS. IS BY ITS VERY NATURE PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED -- TO THE THE RELIGIOUS. LEADERS -- THEIR PRIESTS THEIR MINISTERS THE RABBIS -- I HAVE A FEELING OF TRUST. AND IN SHARING. UP THERE UP THEIR FAILURES WITH THOSE FOLKS. THE INTENT IS TO HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS IN A A PRIEST WERE -- TO REPORT. SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- TO AUTHORITIES. I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD THEN USE THE PENITENTIAL COMMUNICATION TO SHARE THEIR FEELINGS ANY LONGER -- IT WOULD BE GONE. AND THAT'S SAID I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT WITHIN THE CATHOLIC STRUCTURE -- EVEN IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS PRIEST WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND REVEAL WHAT WAS. STATED IN THE PENITENTIAL COMMUNICATION. UP UNDER THE THREAT ARE UNDER THE RULES OF CANON LAW WHICH WOULD EXCOMMUNICATE THE PRIEST AUTOMATICALLY [inaudible] THANK MANAGER. THANK YOU. OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON PARTY MY COLLEAGUES [inaudible] ON I HAVE A FEW -- IT. FIVE REFERENCE THAT BY. THIS SILENCE IS WHAT HAS ALLOWED CHILDREN TO CONTINUE TO BE ABUSED BUT I REALLY SHOULD NOT ABUSE CHILDREN ALONE. IS L. HAS ALLOWED [inaudible] ANYONE. ADULTS CHILDREN ANY H.. TO CONTINUE TO BE ABUSED. AND WE SEE THAT IN POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS. THAT UNFORTUNATELY. NOT ALL BUT MANY ARE. I WANT TO SAY NECESSARILY DESIGN SUCH BUT WITHIN THOSE POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS IF THERE ARE. ABUSERS. THAT THE ENTITIES PROTECT THEMSELVES SO WE SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN WHETHER IT WAS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. OR DIFFERENT FAITH BASED GROUPS. OR SCOUTS ORGANIZATIONS FOR SO MANY THINGS EMPLOYERS WORKPLACES WHERE? UNTIL WE HAVE HAD LAWS TO MAKE IT SAFE. FOR PEOPLE AFFECTED TO REPORT WITHOUT RETALIATION AND WITHOUT. CONSEQUENCE YOU KNOW MINIMAL CONSEQUENCES TO THEMSELVES THAT THESE THE SILENCE CONTINUES THE ABUSE. AND WE SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IN ANY NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS AND WE'VE TAKEN MANY MANY ACTIONS WHETHER IT'S CHANGING WORKPLACE RULES. OR A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER. LAWS IN ORDER TO PROTECT ABUSERS AND TO MAKE IT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO COME FORWARD -- WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS PUT? THE RELIGIOUS FOLKS ON THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH ALL OF THEIR MANDATORY REPORTERS WHICH I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME. GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT. THE PREVALENCE OF ABUSE WITHIN THESE RELIGIOUS SETTINGS. AND THAT FOR US NOT TO WOULD BE PUTTING OUR HEAD IN THE SAND -- SO I SUPPORT THE BILL AND APPRECIATE SENATOR HILL THAT YOU BROUGHT IT BACK [inaudible] AND THE UNLESS THERE'S ANY OTHER. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AND THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY TO THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE SPOKEN MAYBE FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT DOES GET EASIER TO SPEAK ABOUT IT -- BUT IT NEVER FIFTY EXPERIENCES THAT YOU EXPERIENCE THEY NEVER GO AWAY YOU DON'T FORGET. BUT IT DOES GET EASIER TO SPEAK ABOUT IT AND IT'S HEALING. MAY WE HAVE A ROLL CALL. A CLOSE AND I'M SURE A YES SORRY MILITARY HAILING ME CLOSE I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A HIGHLIGHT A FEW POINTS IN THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND SENATOR JACKSON THANK YOU FOR YEARS -- AND I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE. UNDER GREAT I'M SURE OF PAIN TODAY IT IT DID NOT GO UNNOTICED ONE OR IS IT -- TO ON VALUED BY A BY YOUR COMMENTS. HE YOU INTEREST IN THE MADE THE COMMENT ABOUT HEAD IN THE SAND MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK. THAT IS A ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION STATED THAT THE YO KNOW A PERSON GOING TO THE CHURCH -- OF GOING INTO A CONFESSIONAL OR HAVING THAT COMMUNICATION NOW WON'T. BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- BUT I THINK WITH THE HEAD IN THE SAND IS. IS THIS ALSO WOULD APPLY TO CLERGY. AND CLERGY COMMUNICATION OR KNOWLEDGE OF SO WHEN A MEMBER OF THE CLERGY NOTED ANOTHER CLERGY OR HERE'S OF OR SEES OR HEARS SOMETHING. THEY WILL HAVE TO REPORT THAT IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS. AND IN RELATED TO TEXAS ACTUALLY ON THE THE CATHOLIC -- DISS -- WEBSITE IT CLEARLY STATES THAT -- TEXAS -- LAW DOES NOT -- VALUE DOES NOT -- TO RESPECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE PENITENTS -- THE PENITENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS SO THEY'RE TWO VERY CLEAR THERE AND IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING AND IS SENATOR JACKSON'S SO ABLY COMMENTED NO FREEDOMS ARE ABSOLUTE. FREEDOM OF SPEECH BUT YOU AS WE KNOW WE CAN'T YELL FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATER. WITH FREEDOM OF RELIGION IN OF THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE AND PRACTICE THAT RELIGION BUT AS WE KNOW POLYGAMY -- FROM THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS IS CHANGE IS NOT LEGAL AND JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN THIS. BUILDING WE PASSED A MANDATORY VACCINATION LAW THAT ELIMINATED. EXEMPTIONS RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS FOR ME RELIGION BECAUSE THE GREATER HARM CAUSED BY THE EXERCISE AND A PRACTICE OF RELIGION -- SHOULD SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER HELEN FOR THE FOR THE ROLL CALL APOLOGIES FOR INDULGING ME COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT THE OTHER COMMON I WAS GOING TO MAKE IS THAT. I GUESS IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN. KIND OF ASTOUNDED OUT MAYBE STANDARDS TOO STRONG OF A WORD BUT IN OUR SINCE OUR PASSAGE OF SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH ALLOWED. FOR THE FIRST TIME CERTAIN RECORDS AROUND INVESTIGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT CERTAIN ONLY VERY SPECIFIC INCIDENTS [inaudible] THE THE THE AT LEAST WITHIN COVERED BY THE PRESS. THE A A PREDOMINANT RECORDS THAT. ENDED UP BEING RELEASED OUR RECORDS RELATED. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABUSE OF THEIR POWER. TOWARDS -- IN IN SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL ABUSE IT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SO IT'S JUST ANOTHER. EXAMPLE OF OF POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS THAT [inaudible] BY. BY US NOT HAVING FULL TRANSPARENCY. IT CAN PERPETUATE NOW CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT ALL JUST ALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE JUNE HEIGHTENED CAJUN THIS LEVEL OF ABUSE ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT DO NOT. YOU KNOW IT IS A MINORITY BUT THE MORE THAT IT'S COVERED UP. THEN THE MORE IT CAN CONTINUE SO. SENATOR MORE LACK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM. I WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE RESOLVE. SOMETHING THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED -- BUT I'M ALSO A LITTLE NERVOUS AS A REPRESENTATIVE TAXPAYERS SAID WE FIND OURSELVES IN LITIGATION OVER OVER THIS BILL SHOULD PASS. WE HAD. ONE YEARS AGO WHERE WE SAID. ABORTION CLINICS NEED THERE ARE I MEAN ARE PRO LIFE OR PRO CLINICS NEED TO ABBOTT SIGNED IN. THAT WOULD ALL WAY TO THE STATE TO US SUPREME COURT AND LOST I WANT TO BE CAREFUL. ABOUT THE EXPENDITURE OF OF FUNDS. I'M NOT A LAWYER -- BUT I'M I'M I'M I'M JUST SENSING THAT. WE MAY BE STEPPING INTO AN AREA THAT IS A RIGHT JUST BECAUSE BUT MAY HAVE AN EXPENSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. AFTER A FEW YEARS SOLVE ALL BE ALL PLAYING OFF ON THIS BILL TODAY MADAM CHAIR THE MINIATURE MAY I RESPOND AS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE VERY BRIEFLY. CURRENTLY SORRY BRIEFLY THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE COURTS ARE THE AVENUE WE NEED TO PURSUE. AND IF IT'S TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT PEOPLE FROM ABUSE AND IF IT'S TO CHALLENGE A PRACTICE -- THAT HAS. THE SO CALLED. PROTECTIONS UNDER RELIGIOUS BELIEF EXEMPTIONS -- I THINK IT'S PROBABLY AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ULTIMATELY. TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT CHANCE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW. THE CLAIMS OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF -- SUPERSEDE THE PROTECTIONS OF PEOPLE AND THE PUBLIC WELFARE SO THAT MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING ISSUE SHOULD GET TO THE COURT. AND PERHAPS APPROPRIATELY SO PERHAPS IT IS AND FOR US TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AS TO WHETHER THE CONSTITUTION. SHOULD BE EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE FIRST AMENDMENT GOES TO ALLOW. THE FILES TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR PET APHELIA IF THEY SEEK -- IF THEY SEE. IF THEY SEEK -- ABSOLUTION FROM THEIR CHURCH -- AND THAT MIGHT BE A VERY INTERESTING CASE I SUSPECT THE COURT WILL COME DOWN. TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC -- BUT SOMETIMES WE SHOULD BE WELCOMING OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE JUDICIARY TO EXERCISE ITS RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND TO APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS. RIGHT WE HAD TO CLOSE. OUT FURTHER DISCUSSION WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL. MOTIONS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER HI IN OUR AYE MOORLACH [inaudible] BRADFORD. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MOREAU WIENER. WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN -- UNTIL MY ABSENT MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO RETURN. BUT ARE GREATLY APPRECIATE. YOUR PARTICIPATION YOUR TESTIMONY AND THANK YOU SENATOR HILL. THANK YOU MEMBERS COLLEAGUES. ALRIGHT SO WE WILL NOW GO TO ITEM SEVEN SB. TWO TWO FOR A SENATOR GROUP PARDON ME [inaudible] THIS. I WAS LIKE. SENATOR GROWTH YOU MAY. RECEIVE. YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD ALL PROBABLY TAKE A BREAK. YEAH. ANYWAYS GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PRESENT THIS BILL. IDEA WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH -- MY STAFF AND WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS ON THIS BILL. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW I REPRESENT SOME OF THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS IN THE ENTIRE STATE. ACTUALLY KERN AND TULARE OR TWO OUT OF THE TOP FIVE IN THE NATION. IN THE COUNTIES AND BOTH OF THEM ARE IN MY DISTRICT SB TWO TWENTY FOUR MAKES AGRICULTURE GRAND THEFT A SEPARATE KILEY A SEPARATE CRIME AND DIRECTS THESE FINES ASSESSED WITH THE RESULT OF A CONVICTION. OF THAT CRIME BACK INTO EXISTING ROLE CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE A TANGIBLE RESULTS BY ALLOWING NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS TO SHARE INFORMATION AND CRIME STATISTICS DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION OF REAL CRIME AND LAW ENFORCEMENT RECOVERY EFFORTS FOR AGRICULTURE PROPERTY. THESE TWO PROGRAMS ARE KNOWN TODAY AS A CENTRAL VALLEY AND CENTRAL COAST REAL CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THESE COUNTIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS ARE FRESNO KERN KINGS MADERA MERCED MONTEREY SAN BENITO SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. SANTA CRUZ SAN JOAQUIN SEE A SAN LUIS OBISPO AND STANISLAUS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE TULARE COUNTY LOCAL FARMERS INJURED ON AN AVERAGE OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF LOSSES IN AGRICULTURE EQUIPMENT. THAT SUCH INCLUDED SPECIALIZED TRACTORS ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES. AND THAT ARE USED FOR THE MOVEMENT OF FOOD PRODUCTION FOR THAT ARE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES RELY ON FOR FARMERS LOSING -- AMID A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR TRACTOR CAN BE DEVASTATING THESE LOSSES REQUIRE TIME. AND MANY TO REPLACE FIX AND A RECOVERY EQUIPMENT AND CAN RESULT IN COMPLETE LOSS OF CROPS. AND BE DEVASTATING TO A SMALLER OPERATORS. AS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS TOGETHER TO RESPOND TO THE SHARP INCREASE IN AGRICULTURE CRIME IT BECOMES CLEAR. THAT COMBINING AGRICULTURAL THEFT WITH WHAT OTHER PROPERTY THEFT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY ASSESS. THE IMPACT OF THE RESOURCES IN IT AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES SB TWO TO FOUR SEPARATES OUT AGRICULTURAL THEFT FROM OTHER TYPES OF THEFT HELPING LAW ENFORCEMENT BETTER WORK ACROSS JURISDICTIONS TO IDENTIFY CRIMINAL PATTERNS. SB TWO TWENTY FOUR ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE PROCEEDS AND THE FINES COLLECTED AS A RESULT OF A CONVICTION OF THAT CRIME. BE DIRECTED BACK TO THE REAL CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTIES. PROGRAMS ENSURING THAT ANY RECRUITER PROFFERED TO ME I MADE BY DEFENDANTS THROUGH THE ILLEGAL SELLING OF AGRICULTURE PARK PROPERTY IS RECIRCULATED. BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES TO HELP THE REAL CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAMS. SEPT OF AGRICULTURAL QUICK QUICK MEANT NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF FARMERS AND AGRICULTURE BUSINESS OWNERS TO MAKE A LIVING IT ALSO PARALYZES FOOD PRODUCTION IN COMMERCIAL GOODS. FROM FOOD TEXTILE MATERIALS AND WATER WHICH TURNS THE EFFECTS OF THE WHOLE STATE. WHEN CRIMINAL STEAL FROM FARMERS THEY'RE ALSO STEALING FOOD FROM THE TABLES OF HARD WORKING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO TWENTY FOURS TULARE COUNTY SHERIFF MIKE PEDRO? AND MY CALL REPRESENTING FARMERS AND THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. THANK YOU WITNESSES YOU MAY PROCEED. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE BOUDREAUX I'M THE SHERIFF OF TULARE COUNTY THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME THIS MORNING. JUST GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION BACKGROUND AND TULARE COUNTY. EACH YEAR TULARE COUNTY FARMERS PRODUCE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DIFFERENT COMMODITIES WHICH PROVIDE FOOD TO OVER NINETY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. TULARE COUNTY IS OFTENRANKED IN THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IS OFTEN IN THE TOP FIVE NATIONALLY. CROP AND LIVESTOCK REPORTS FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN SURE THE WERE PRODUCING ANCILLARY COUNTY BETWEEN SIX AND EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COMMODITIES AGRICULTURE. EVERY YEAR. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'M FACING IS TO LAKE COUNTY SHERIFF EACH YEAR HI FACE APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF AGRICULTURAL THEFT. IN MY COUNTY ALONE. FOR MANY YEARS TULARE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE THERE AG CRIMES UNIT WE RECEIVE FUNDING FOR DETECTIVES THAT WOULD HELP TO PLAY EQUIPMENT RESOURCES TRAINING IN A SOCIAL RESOURCES THAT WOULD HELP INVESTIGATE THESE TYPES OF CRIME. OVER THE COURSE OF YEARS WE'VE SEEN REDUCTION IN THAT. THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT WITHIN AGRICULTURE AS LONG AS THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE THEY WILL STILL OUR AGRICULTURE. OFTENTIMES WE SEE AGRICULTURAL THEFT IS BATTERIES OR COPPER WIRE IN FAST AND IT MAY SEEM MINOR IN NATURE IN THE BEGINNING BUT THE THE ELEMENT SOPHISTICATION OF CRIMINALS OF TODAY IN THE AGRICULTURAL WORLD. IS QUITE ALARMING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD WHAT WAS CALLED THE JUSTIN GREER CATTLE THEFT AND EMBEZZLEMENT CASE. JUSTIN GRINS FATHER BRUCE GEAR BRUCE GEAR STOLE OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CATTLE. EMBEZZLEMENT AND DIFFERENT BUSINESSES WHICH THIS INVESTIGATION WHEN ACROSS FOUR DIFFERENT STATES. AND DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASES WE SPENT THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF MAN HOURS IN THIS CASE NOT REIMBURSED COMING OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND. USING OUR ROLE CRIMES UNIT. ANOTHER CASE IN POINT WOULD BE CASE WHEN INTERNATIONALLY. THE TULARE COUNTY ALLMAN OF THE STASH SHOW PRODUCERS FELL VICTIM TO AN ORGANIZED CRIME GROUP. FROM. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PISTACHIOS AND US WERE STONE. SOME OF THESE NOTES WERE LOCATED -- IN SHIPS WERE ACTUALLY HEADING INTERNATIONALLY TO SAUDI ARABIA AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THIS CASE TO DETECTIVES ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH MULTI INVESTIGATION WITH MULTI AGENCIES BOTH IN LOS ANGELES AS WELL AS A CENTRAL SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHICH DEPLETED OUR RESOURCES. THE TWENTY COUNTY SHERIFF'S OUTSIDE UNIT USES CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS EXPENSIVE BECOMES AVAILABLE ONLY THROUGH OUR RURAL CRIMES INTO COMBAT ARE REAL CRIME EFFORTS. WE USE GPS TRACKERS LEADS ONLINE SYSTEMS ACQUIRING AND IMPLEMENTING NEW AND EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY AGAIN WHICH IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE BUT YET. OUR FARMERS ARE FARMWORKERS OUR FAMILIES OUR STORES ARE ALL IMPACTED OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ALL IMPACTED BY THESE AGRICULTURAL FAST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I DO SUPPORT SB TWO TWENTY FOUR AM BY MAKING ACCESS TO SEPARATE CRIME IN RECIRCULATING MONEY FROM FINES BACK IN THE ROLE CRIMES PROGRAMS. THIS COULD TRULY HELP A BADLY NEEDED ADDITION OF RESOURCES AND PERSONNEL TO SUPPORTER EFFORT TO STOP THE CRIME EFFORTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S MICHAEL -- I AM A FORMER MANAGER OF IT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND ACRE RANCH IN YOUR COUNTY. WHERE I'VE BEEN EMPLOYED FOR ALMOST TWENTY NINE YEARS -- I AM STRONG SUPPORTER THIS BILL IS THE CONTINUED INCREASE AND AG THEFT AND AND OUR R. RANCHO LOAN -- ONE OF THE THINGS TO SHARE OF MENTION ABOUT COPPER WIRE THAT HE'S BEEN A BIG PROBLEM IN YOLO COUNTY. AND IT'S NOT THE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS OR TWENTY DOLLARS THAT THEY GET FROM THE WATER IT'S THE TWENTY OR THIRTY OR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR REPAIR. THAT TO A PUMP STATION -- AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY. WE HAVE ROUGHLY NINE MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED EVERY YEAR IN THE RICE CROP IN OF WATERS NOT ABLE TO BE DELIVERED BECAUSE OF THE STAFF STATES SHUT DOWN A PUMP STATION. IT'S DEVASTATING -- OVER THE YEARS WE'VE. YOU KNOW I I WENT BACK THROUGH LOOK TO JOB DESCRIPTIONS IN THE CHANGE SO MUCH AND SECURITY HAS BECOME SUCH A BIG PART. OF THE EMPLOYEES NOW -- LAST WEEK WE HAD A TRACTOR. IT WAS -- STOLE FROM ONE OF THE YARDS AND LIKELY THEY CAN GET AROUND THE GATE AND GOT STUCK -- BUT IT TOOK PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR HOURS OF VIEWING OUR SECURITY SYSTEM BY MY SECRETARY TO TRY TO GET FIGURE OUT WHO WOULD TAKE EFFECT. SO I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT. AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO DETER THIS STAFFED THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IN THE MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE A CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING LUCIA MUCH LOBBY OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. MY SECOND DOLLARS THE DAUGHTER OF A SMALL WELL -- THE DROUGHT HAS SEVERELY HANDICAPPED SMALL FARMERS IN MY CELL AND TO LARRY AND I JUST WANT TO SPEAK. ON BEHALF OF MY FATHER AND MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS WHO HAD FALLEN VICTIM TO THE CRIMES LIKE THIS AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A LOT WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE. A HUNDRED EIGHTY TO TWO HUNDRED ACRES AND WITH THE DROUGHT IN THE NEW EXPENSES ON WATER REGULATION. THIS COULD REALLY HELP ON THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS STEELER OCEAN THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT TO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE AGO IT GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING LESLIE CALDWELL FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION I JUST WANNA LET THE COMMITTEE AND THE SENATOR NO WE ARE WITHDRAWING OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ART TO SEEING THEIR OPPOSITION -- BEEN BEFORE I TAKE COMMENTS OR I WILL CALL IN THE NEXT GENERAL I JUST WANT -- TO CLARIFY THAT -- I THINK MOST OBSERVERS OF THIS COMMITTEE KNOW THAT WE TEND NOT TO AS CHAIR I TEND NOT TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON BILLS. THAT ARE CREATE NEW CRIMES OR EXPAND SYNCING BUT THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE PENALTIES. IT PRIMARILY IMPROVES OUR ABILITY TO TRACK THE CRIMES -- IN A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THAT IS WHAT ITS FOCUSES -- AND SO I HAVE MADE A RECOMMENDATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL SENATE AROUND CHAIR. YES. THANK YOU. I HAD A QUESTION THE OTHER. THE STATE AT SOME OF THE LOSSES THROUGH THE THING COTTON. OF THE CEILING -- THE COPPER WIRE AND THE FENCES NECK I THINK BUT YOU SORT OF MADE REFERENCE TO THAT THERE'S OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED YOU KNOW JUST BE ON THE TH AFTER THAT COULD YOU COULD YOU SHARE SOME OF THOSE OTHER COST AND IN. IT YOU KNOW. ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CRIMES OF THE STAFF YES I YOU KNOW I'M GLAD YOU ASKED WE AYE ACE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ONE OF OUR CITRUS FARMERS HE HAS OVER A THOUSAND ACRES OF CITRUS AND DURING TIMES OF FREEZE AND WHAT IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND HOW THE ORANGE WORKS ITSELF IF THE INTERNAL. PORTION OF THAT ORANGE FREEZES YOUR ENTIRE CROP IS DECIMATED. THERE'S WINDMILLS THROUGHOUT -- WINDMILLS THE WIND MACHINES THAT ARE THROUGHOUT -- THE THE CITRUS ORCHARDS THAT HELP KEEP THE TEMPERATURES CERTAIN LEVEL. IF A CRIMINAL COMES IN AND STEALS BATTERIES OR DIESEL OR COPPER BASED ON ANY OF THOSE WHEN MACHINES BEING USED IN YOUR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. HAVING TO GET THOSE NGUYEN MACHINES GOING ONE DEGREE. CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SUCCESSFUL YEAR. AND AN EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LOSS BASED ON PORTIONS OF THAT ACREAGE NOT RECEIVING THAT TEMPERATURE SO THE OVERALL DAMAGE MAY BE SMALL IN NATURE WITH THE THEFT OF AN EIGHTY DOLLAR BATTERY OR A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR PIECE OF COPPER. OR SIXTY GALLONS OF GASOLINE. BUT THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THAT CROP COULD BE DEVASTATING TO THE FARMER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE BILL GREAT WE HAVE A MOTION SENATOR GROVER G. LIKE -- TO CLOSE IS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE THAT THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WE'LL HAVE A ROLL CALL MISSION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER HI IN OUR AYE MORLOCK. BRADFORD.

FOR THANK YOU. PRESENTING AND WE WILL IN YOUR WITNESSES. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO LET'S SEE WHAT WE AT NOW -- CENTER WILK. THIS IS ITEM THIRTEEN SP. FOUR ZERO NINE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SB FOUR OH NINE HELPS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND STATE COUNTY AND CITY AGENCIES STOP PROPERTY OWNERS AND TRUCK OWNER OPERATORS FROM ENGAGING IN UNLAWFUL DROPPING THE RESULT IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION DAMAGE. EXISTING LAW ADDRESSES ONLY SITUATIONS IN WHICH A PROPERTY OWNER DOES NOT GIVE PERMISSION TO UNLAWFULLY DUMP WASTE MATTER ON HIS OR HER PROPERTY. MANY PROPERTY OWNERS ARE GIVING TRUCK OWNERS AND OPERATORS COMMISSION TO TOP WASTE MATTER ON THEIR LAND WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING THE REQUIRED PERMITS FROM STATE COUNTY AND OR LOCAL AGENCIES. THE OWNERS PROFIT FROM COLLECTING CASH FOR TRUCK OWNERS SLASH OPERATORS PROFIT FROM CHARGING THE HIGH COSTS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF WASTE. INTENDED FOR LICENSE DUMPSITE INSTEAD DELIVERING THE WAYS TO PROPERTY OWNERS LAND FOR FAR LOWER AMOUNT OF MONEY THERE BY POCKETING THE DIFFERENCE. YES BEFORE -- NINE CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE IS STATE LAW BY DRESSING SITUATIONS WHICH A PROPERTY OWNER GETS CONSENT. ANY AS TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSPORTERS OF WAYS TO THE STATUTE THE BILL ALSO. INC IS INCREASING PENALTIES AS EXISTING AS EXISTING FIGHT AMOUNTS ARE LOW NOTE THAT VIOLATORS CONSIDER IT CHEAPER TO OFFEND -- SERVING LITTLE TO NO INSTANCE SERVING AS LITTLE TO NO INCENTIVE TO STOPPING THIS UNLAWFUL PRACTICE. IN THE END OF THE ALLEY THERE WERE EIGHTY NINE PROPERTIES BETWEEN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THROUGH MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THAT HAD A NOTICE A BUILDING CODE VIOLATIONS. RECORDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS DUE TO THE DUMPING OF WASTE EXCEEDING FIFTY KEEPING GUARDS ON THE PROPERTY. THIS NUMBER ONLY PLACE VALLEY AND IF IT IS RAPID THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY. THOSE WHITE IS CRUCIAL THAT THE STREET AND THAT THOSE TRANSPORTING THE WASTE FACE CONSEQUENCES. AND FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO STOP THEM FROM POLLUTING. OTHERS RECENT CASE OUT IN THE LAKE LOS ANGELES AREA. WHERE THEY WERE CAUGHT AND THEN THEY COULD BACON CHICKEN THEY WERE CAUGHT THEY WERE CITED BUT THEN THEY CONTINUE TO DUMP BUT THEY WERE DOING IT AT NIGHT -- THE EVENTUALLY PROSECUTED BUT ALL THE NEIGHBORS WERE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A BY ALL THAT WASTE -- THAT WAS DUMPED -- AND AND FOR FOR ME THIS IS AREA THIS IS CONCERNING THE ADULT VALLEY THIS THESE MOST OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE RURAL. THEY'RE POOR AND THEY'RE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR I RECENTLY MET WITH -- I HEART LAKE LOS ANGELES AND IT'S A COMMUNITY ACTIVIST GROUP. THAT'S COMMITTED TO TO CLEANING UP THEIR COMMUNITY I BELIEVE YOU HAVE OF PHOTOS. OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SITES THAT THEY'VE DONE INCLUDING HAVING MEDICAL WASTE DONT -- IN A VACANT LOT. WHERE KIDS HAVE TO WALK TO GET TO GET TO SCHOOL? THEREFORE I BELIEVE THIS IS A APPROPRIATE MEASURE THAT WILL. THAT ASSESS ADEQUATE PUNISHMENTS% FOR THOSE USING A USING THIS LOOPHOLE. TO ADVERSELY AFFECT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I'M ALSO HAPPY TO NOTIFY YOU OF LATE SUPPORT. RECEIVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS WHICH IS THE STATE'S EMPLOYED SCIENTISTS RESPONSIBLE PROTECT AND PROTECTING THE PUBLIC WILDLIFE AND NATURAL RESOURCES FROM WASTE AND POLLUTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE -- CENTER MITCHELL GO TO YOUR QUESTION AFTER WE HEAR FROM ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OKAY. SO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR UP THAT RAN WITH THEIR IN READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL SCIENTISTS WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL. ILLEGAL DUMPING IS A PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED IN THE WAY WE MAKE THE WAY TO DISCOURAGE IT IS TO MAKE IT LESS PROFITABLE AND WE THINK THIS BILL DOES THAT SOME THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THE BILL. YEAH WE HAVE IN THE MOTION. K. LIKE TO BE YOURS [inaudible] THE HEAD. LESLIE CALDWELL FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. FIRST OF ALL -- WE ARE OPPOSED BECAUSE THIS MAKES AN INFRACTION A MISDEMEANOR. SO IT RAISES THE CONSEQUENCES AS WE ALL KNOW MISDEMEANORS HAVE A VARIETY OF COLLATERAL -- CONSEQUENCES TO INCLUDE LICENSING DENIALS EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES REMOVED -- AND THEY FILL ARE ALREADY FULL JAILS -- THE SENATOR REFERRED TO POOR RURAL. AREAS LARGELY PEOPLE OF COLOR THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WILL FACE THE MOST CONSEQUENCES IN ERMS OF RAISING THIS FROM AN INFRACTION. TO A MISDEMEANOR. COUNTY JAIL COST SOMEWHERE AROUND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO HOUSE AN INMATE. THAT'S JUST SLIGHTLY LESS THAN IT WOULD COST TO SEND SOMEONE TO STANFORD OR HARVARD. THERE'S NO REASON TO MAKE THIS A MISDEMEANOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR PERMISSION FOR THIS DUMPING THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DISCOURAGE THIS. THEN TO SPEND THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL AND ENDANGERING LICENSES AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND SCHOOLING OPPORTUNITIES THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM HAIR MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TEST BEFORE -- NINE I WOULD ECHO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS. ON AN AD A COUPLE ADDITIONAL POINTS ON FIRST WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY -- IT IS ALREADY UNLAWFUL TO TRANSPORT THESE MATERIALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DUMPING THEM ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITHOUT THE OWNER'S CONSENT. SO LONG AS A PERSON TRANSPORTING THESE MATERIALS HAS THE SPECIFIC INTENT TO COMMIT THE CRIME THE PERSON CAN ALREADY BE CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED DUMPING UNDER CURRENT LAW. IF A PERSON TRANSPORTING THESE MATERIALS DOES NOT POSSESS THE SPECIFIC INTENT TO DUMP THEM. THEN THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BE GUILTY OF A CRIME WHETHER AS AN ATTEMPT UNDER CURRENT LAW. OR AS A NEW CRIME UNDER SB -- NINE ON SECOND UP WHILE THE GOAL OF ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SEEK APPROPRIATE PERMITS AND LICENSES TO DEPOSIT THESE MATERIALS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. IS WORTHWHILE FAILURE TO DO SO DOES NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A CRIME. SUCH FAILURES ARE MORE APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED TO PROFESSIONAL REGULATIONS AND ALREADY ARE UNDER EXISTING LAW. AND LASTLY CRIMINALIZING BOTH THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE PERSON WHO DEPOSITS THE MATERIALS WHEN IT IS OFTEN THE CASE THAT NEITHER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING THE PERMIT OR LICENSE. AND MAY NOT KNOW WHETHER A PERMIT OR LICENSE ONCE PROPERLY OBTAINED WILL NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESS OR TO TURN THE BEHAVIOR CONTEMPLATED BY THE SPELL. INSTEAD THE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AN INCREASE MANDATORY FINDS MADE NEEDLESSLY FALL ON WELL INTENTIONED PROPERTY OWNERS AN INNOCENT LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE FINES. AND WHOSE INABILITY TO PAY THESE FINES WILL HAVE LASTING CONSEQUENCES ON THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THIRD WHAT CORPORATE SHE TO PICTURES -- AND WHAT I ASSUMED IN READING THE ANALYSIS AND THE BILL WAS THAT YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THESE THESE COMPANIES WITH BIG TRUCKS THAT ARE DOWN THE ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE PICTURES YOU SO. YOU KNOW THE HOUSEHOLD ITEMS. YOU KNOW MY QUESTION REALLY IS. IF THE CURRENT SOLUTION OF PENALIZING A TO THE BIG COMPANIES IS IT WORKING DO YOU REALLY THINK. MOVING IT FROM ONE CATEGORY. OF A CRIME TO ANOTHER IT WILL MAKE THAT SIGNIFICANT A DIFFERENCE SO IN THE SECOND QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER BOTH -- OPPOSITION SAID THE PEOPLE HAVE PERMISSION TO DUMP. ON PRIVATE LAND BUT I'M ASSUMING LAKE LOS ANGELES'S AND PRIVATE LAND ROB SOMEBODY IS HAPPENING. GREAT -- BOTH A GREAT QUESTION SO SOME TERMS OF THE BILL SO -- THIS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE EVERYWHERE IT'S A BIG ISSUE MY DISTRICT I AS YOU I'M SURE YOU'RE WHERE RECENTLY THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SAID THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THEM. THERE ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT-REACHED OUT THE WANTING IT. TO YEAH IT DIDN'T TO DO THIS AS WELL AS LA DA'S OFFICE WHO ACTUALLY WROTE THIS -- WE STILL HAVE A SUPPORT LETTER FROM THEM -- I'M. SO IT I DON'T TAKE PRIDE OF AUTHORSHIP IN TERMS OF THAT IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN ENHANCE PENALTIES BUT IT'S LESS THAN THAN THE MISTER MEAN I'M FINE WITH THAT WE JUST WANNA PUT ENOUGH ECONOMIC IN. DISINCENTIVE IN THERE. THE LIKELIHOOD -- SO I MEAN SO THAT'S IT SO THESE MOST OF THESE ARE THESE ARE PROFESSIONAL COPY BECAUSE THE TIPPING FEES HAVE GONE UP IN LA. SO THESE ARE MOSTLY PROFESSIONAL COMPANIES ARE COMING AND IN DOING IT NOT JUST GESTURE GESTURE RANDOM PEOPLE AND ITIS RAMPANT THROUGHOUT AND I GUESS MY OTHER QUESTION WOULD BE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE NUMBER OF OF TRUCK DRIVERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IS NOT ALWAYS THE BIG COMPANY. SO I AS WE TRY TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES AND RECOGNIZING THE OTHER PRESSURES THAT INDEPENDENT TRUCK DRIVERS ARE EXPERIENCING. THIS WILL PUT THAT ON THE TABLE TO A YEAH I I AT MY UNDER IT AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS IS IT'S ALWAYS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS BUT THEY DID IT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE LANDOWNERS OKAY WITH THE DUMPING WELL IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROPER PERMITTING. AND IT'S NOT SANCTIONED. IT SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T BE SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND I WATER I I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE THINGS ARE SAD THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE I THINK THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. SO I AM OPEN IN TERMS OF WHAT IS A WHAT IS THE PARTICULAR SANCTION OUGHT TO BE. I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THE SWEET SPOT WHERE DOES IT DISCOURAGES THIS SO. THANK YOU MAY I VENTURE. THAT SENATOR JACKSON YES AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE YOU KNOW WE'RE A CHINA'S NO LONGER TAKING A LOT OF OUR WASTE AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO WITH IT -- SO -- BEFORE YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE LAUGH AT THE NOTION WE'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF PLASTIC BAGS AND AND PLASTIC STRAWS AND THINGS THAT ARE REALLY CREATING PROBLEMS AND THEN WE'VE GOT OF COURSE -- THINGS LIKE OUR BATTERIES AND OTHER TOXIC MATERIALS IN CHINA'S NO LONGER TAKING WE DON'T WANT DUMPED IN OUR NEIGHBOR'S YARDS OR OUR YARDS ARE BACKYARDS. SO WHY I APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- I'M WONDERING THOUGH MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF OFFERED -- OR RECOMMENDED THAT YOU -- THE TAKEN AMENDMENT TO LEAVE EXISTING PENALTIES IN PLACE BUT WHILE INCREASING THOSE TO WHOM THE BILL APPLIES AND I WONDER IT DIDN'T HEAR YOU MENTION THAT -- I I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WE DON'T NEED MORE CRIMES TO TETRA TECH FOR BUT WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHORS INDICATED. THAT THEY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT AND I'M WONDERING IF THIS MIGHT HELP THOSE THOSE THOSE WERE DISCUSSED NOT OFFERED IT BUT WE'RE WILLING WERE WILING TO TAKE IT TO TAKE THOSEAS AMENDMENTS. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO SO AYE AYE ON MOVE THE BILL ALL SUPPORTED NOW BUT I WANT TO SEE. ACCOMMODATIONS MADE THE GOAL IS TO GET IS TO STOP THE DUMPING SO IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT -- I WILL. BE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION AND KNOW THE AUTHOR TO BE A MAN OF HIS WORD SO WITH THAT MADAM. CHAIR I WOULD -- MOVE THE BILL AS AMENDED I BELIEVE IS THE SENATOR. WHAT CAN KID YOU'LL TAKE THAT AS AN AMENDMENT? SO WITH THAT -- AS AMENDED I WOULD MOVE THE BILL RIGHT SO I WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE ON THE RECORD WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE WOULD BE -- ACCEPTING THE BILL IS WRITTEN IN TERMS OF THE CHANGE. FOR FEES AND FINES BUT WHAT WE WOULD BE. ASKING YOU IN THIS MOTION WOULD BE TO REMOVE THE INCREASE TO MAKING THIS A MISDEMEANOR SO REST STAY IN A FRACTION I'M FINE WITH THAT OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO. WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION -- YOU MAY CLOSE. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS I THINK THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE TO DECREASE ILLEGAL DUMPING WHICH ADVERSELY FAX ACTUALLY ALL COMMUNITIES AND AND FAX CHILDREN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GIVING THIS -- YOUR FULL ATTENTION THIS MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH ND ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. EXCELLENT SO LET'S DO A ROLL CALL ON THE MOTION. WITH THE ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS. AND IT WOULD BE TO PASS AS AGREED TO BE AMENDED TO A PROBES. SKINNER FIVE IN OUR AYE MOORLACH BRADFORD. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL I AM AROUND HI WIENER. ALL RIGHT WITH THE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN. CERTAINLY AND WE WILL NOW GO TO ITEM SIXTEEN SB FOUR EIGHTY FIVE SENATOR BILL [inaudible] BUT GOOD MORNING -- HAPPY TO PRESENT THIS BILL -- SB FORTY FIVE TO THE COMMITTEE -- THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE SUSPENSION. OF A DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR NINE VEHICLE RELATED CRIMES. SUSPENDING A DRIVER'S LICENSE BECAME A POPULAR MESSAGE OF PUNISHMENT IN THE I GUESS THE EIGHTIES OR NINETIES. OF WHETHER OR NOT A CRIME HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH OPERATING A VEHICLE -- IN RESEARCHING THIS I FOUND THAT -- VEHICLE CODE STATUES WERE RATHER HAPHAZARD. YOU KNOW SOME CRIMES WERE. INCLUDED SOME CRIMES ARE NOT -- NO DRIVER'S LICENSE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PEOPLE OF EVERY DAY'S LIVES SUSPENDING A LICENSE FOR CRIMES. UNRELATED TO DRIVING DOES NOT INCREASE THE PUBLIC SAFETY PROBABLY DETERS THE PERSON'S ABILITY TO CARE FOR THE CHILDREN WORK GO TO WORK. MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND PAY RESTITUTION. SALIVA HOODS DEPEND ON HAVING A VALID LICENSE. 78% OF CALIFORNIANS DRIVE TO WORK IN OVER FIVE MILLION JOBS. IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRE A VALID DRIVER'S LICENSE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CHICAGO JOBS COUNCIL RELEASED A REPORT. HIGHLIGHTING THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF UNNECESSARY DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSIONS OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN ILLINOIS. SURVEY FOUND THAT 52%. OF THE RESPONDENTS WHO LOST THEIR LICENSE FOR NON VEHICLE VIOLATIONS. MR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY DO THE SUSPENSION. 72% HAD TO PAY MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO RE OBTAIN A VALID LICENSE AND 31%. IN -- THE STUDY PAID MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO RE OBTAIN A VALID LICENSE. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN MAY BE -- A LEADING FACTOR -- INDIVIDUALS DRIVE THAT CAUSE PEOPLE TO DRIVE WITH A SUSPENDED LICENSE. SUSPENSION FOR NON VEHICLE REALLY CRIME LEASE TO INCARCERATION FINES FEES IMPOUNDING VEHICLES ALL WHICH THIS PORTION DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THIS FOR PUNISHMENT IS REALLY OUTDATED AND EFFECTIVE. NOW FLORIDA PASSED IN A BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO AND SUSPENSIONS FOR NON VEHICLE RELATED CRIMES IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA ALSO TO DO THIS. SB FORTY FIVE IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION. TO MORE THAN ONE PROBLEM INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF THOSE THAT THOSE CONVICTED WILL BE ABLE. TO TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND PAY RESTITUTION. IT ALSO [inaudible] OF IN MY COMMITTEE WE HAD A HEARING ON THE DMV. AND WE SAW HOW FAR BEHIND AN OVERLOAD THE WORKLOAD IS NOW WE FIND OUT THEY'RE ASKING. FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN -- THIS COMING YEAR'S BUDGET. NOW IT THIS ELIMINATES SOME OF THE OF INEFFICIENT UNNECESSARY WORKLOAD. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. I REGION I VOTE WE HAVE SOME SPEAKERS AND TURN OVER THE MEASURE. THANK YOU GO AHEAD WITH INSTANCE SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR. NO MEMBERS. OKAY. JUSTA QUICKLY I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT. TO THE SUIT WE KEEP THIS VERY VERY SHORT I'M LAURIE TOILING BACK TO CONFISCATE ALL FORTY MURATSUCHI ASIANS WITH SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. WHAT SENATE BILL FORTY EIGHTY FIVE REALLY DOES IS TO GET RID OF A LOT OF OLD STRANGE STATUTORY? EXCEPTIONS OF REQUIRE SUSPENSION OF A DRIVER'S LICENSE. EVEN WE'RE DRIVING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OFFENSE. EVEN WHERE THE COURT CONCLUDES HIS LOWER NOR REALLY REHABILITATE FUNCTION AND EVEN WHERE DOING SO MIGHT ACTUALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT. THE DEFENDANT'S ABILITY TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE PAY RESTITUTION. AND SO IN THESE CASES THE SUSPENSION PROVES TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. AND COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE. THE LAW DOES NOT SENATE BILL FORTY FIVE DOES NOT. PREVENT THE JUDGE FROM SUSPENDED A LICENSE WHERE APPROPRIATE. EVEN IN THE CASES WHERE WE'RE CHANGING THE LAW RIGHT HERE. CHURCHES RETAIN THE RIGHT TO IMPOSE ANY PROBATIONARY CONDITION THAT ARE REASONABLY RELATED TO THE CRIME AT ISSUE. NOW IN THIS CASE OBVIOUSLY WINNER DRIVER'S LICENSES INVOLVED DRIVING HAS TO BE INVOLVED SOMEPLACE IN THE EQUATION I WOULD. EXPECT BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF THE JUDGE HAS THE ABILITY TO TAILOR. THE PROBATIONARY CONDITIONS TO THE ACTUAL OFFENSE. BUT ALSO TO THE SITUATION OF THE DEFENDANTS SO YOU DON'T HAVE CASES WHERE. A DEFENDANT. PERHAPS IN A VERY CLOSE URBAN AREA WHO DOESN'T REALLY NEED A CAR IS LOSING HIS LICENSE BUT A DEFENDANT IN A WORLD THAT YOU SEE TO JEWISH AND WHERE. A CAR IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. WOULD NOT SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT IS TRYING TO BRING FAIRNESS AND EQUITY TO THE SITUATION. TO THE SITUATION AND TO GET RID OF SOME OUTDATED LAWS AND I SINCERELY AS FOR THE COMMITTEE'S SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU THREE OF OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I THINK IN THE US WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. MIKE A DOCTOR OFF WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. LESLIE CALDWELL FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. MEDI HIRED FROM THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY IN STRONG SUPPORT. DAN CORRODE OUR MAIL FROM LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPPORT. SABRINA CROW SAID HE WOULD LEGAL SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH CHILDREN IN SUPPORT. MORNING DOMINIQUE NON FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OKAY LET'S SEE IF THERE'S WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING. NINE OF A WE DON'T HAVE OTHER MEMBERS PRESENT I CAN'T MAKE THIS MOTION. NO ALL RIGHT SO. WE GIVE ALL SHE'S SAROVIC THIS IS THE PROBLEM WHEN TUESDAY MORNING COMMITTEES THERE'S OTHER COMMITTEES AND MY MEMBERS ARE OFF EITHER PRESENTING BILLS ARE SITTING IN THEIR OTHER COMMITTEES BUT THEY WILL RETURN -- SO -- WE WILL. HOLD THE BILL -- TO WHAT THE IN WILL ACCEPT A MOTION AS SOON AS OUR MEMBERS RETURN BUT THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND MY RECOMMENDATION ON THE BILL IS SUPPORT. SO. WELL THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE THAT HE GETS THROUGH COMMITTEE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE. AND APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING IT TO US THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY. OF LET'S SEE. WE HAVE SENATOR GLACIER HERE NO -- IN CENTER MITCHELL'S NOT HERE BUT I AM HERE IF I COULD PRESENT TO MYSELF -- I THINK WHAT WE WILL DO RIGHT NOW. IT WAS WILL JUST TAKE A TEN MINUTE RECESS -- NO ALL RIGHT WHAT [inaudible] CREATION. WE COULD TAKE A TEN MINUTE RECESS. AND BY THEN I THINK SOME OF OUR OWN. ACCUSE ME. MEMBERS MIGHT BE BACK AND WE CAN LEAST -- GET THE MOTION -- SENATOR BILLS BILL OR MY OR I MYSELF COULD PERCENT SO WE WILL DO A TEN MINUTE RECESS. FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WHICH MEANS WE WILL RETURN AT TEN FORTY FIVE OKAY. THANK YOU OUR COMMITTEE AGAIN AND SENATOR GLAZER YOU GET TO PRESENT TO ME. SIR WE ARE -- ITEM NINETEEN SB. SIX FIVE ONE YOU CAN HEAR ME. TRY AGAIN AND NOW IS IT WORKING YES THANK. WELL THANK YOU AT YOUR SKINNER AND MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMITTEE FOR BEING HERE. FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL AT AS A MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW ALL DEFENDANTS CONVICTED OF SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES. AND SENTENCED TO FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE TO MAKE A MOTION FOR DISCOVERY. INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY SERVING TIME FOR CRIMES THAT THEY DID NOT COMMIT. HORACE ROBERTS FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHO IS NOW SIXTY WAS EXONERATED AFTER SPENDING NINETEEN YEARS IN PRISON. FOR A MURDER HE DID NOT COMMIT. CHORUS WAS RELEASED THIS PAST OCTOBER AFTER FORENSIC EVIDENCE CLEARED HIM OF THE CRIME. AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT'S THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THE ACTUAL KILLER. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES PEOPLE LIKE CHORUS WHO ARE SERVING TIME FOR CRIMES THEY NEVER COMMITTED. JUSTICE ALL DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THE FIRST TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES THAT. THAT'S WHY WE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY LAST YEAR. WHICH EXPANDED POST CONVICTION MOTION FOR DISCOVERY TO DEFENDANTS CONVICTED OF SERIOUS VIOLENT CRIMES AND SENTENCED TO FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE BEGINNING ON JANUARY FIRST. NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN BUT DUE TO LAST MINUTE AMENDMENTS LAST YEAR THE BILL ONLY APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO FUTURE CASES. UNFORTUNATELY THIS MEANT THAT ANYONE CONVICTED PRIOR TO TWENTY NINETEEN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE A MOTION FOR DISCOVERY. THIS BILL ALLOWS THE PROVISIONS OF AB NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TO APPLY RETROACTIVELY TO CASES BEFORE JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AS MEMBERS KNOW DISCOVERY PROVIDES DEFENDANTS WITH DOCUMENTS AND MATERIALS RELATING TO THEIR CASE. AFTER THEY'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF A QUALIFYING CRIME. THIS CAN BE HELPFUL FOR INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING TIME FOR CRIMES THEY DID NOT COMMIT. BUT A JUDGE THE JUDGE STILL HAS TO GRANT THE MOTION FOR DISCOVERY. SO NOT EVERYONE THAT MAKES A MOTION FOR DISCOVERY IS GRANTED DEFENDANT'S STILL HAVE TO MAKE A STRONG CASE FOR NEEDING THIS INFORMATION. AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO OBTAIN ALL RELEVANT DOCUMENTS. AND MATERIALS THROUGH OTHER AVENUES THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA INNOCENCE COALITION THE ACLU NOW THE GROUPS. THAT ARE DEDICATED TO PROTECTING CIVIL LIBERTIES AND WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR. I UP REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. JOINING ME TODAY IS MESSI O'CONNELL FROM THE CALIFORNIA INNOCENCE COALITION AND MY CAT DR OFF FROM THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY WILL ELIMINATE THIS ISSUE EVEN MORE GOOD MORNING -- THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU SENATOR GLAZER FOR BRINGING SB -- SIX FIFTY ONE AS ALREADY STATED MY NAME IS MELISSA O'CONNELL I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INNOCENCE PROJECT. WE ARE VERY AWARE THA THEY'RE INNOCENT PEOPLE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN OUR PRISONS -- AND MOST OF THEM DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO POST CONVICTION DISCOVERY WITHOUT DISCOVERY -- THE POST CONVICTION REVIEW PROCESS IS INEFFICIENT -- SOMETIMES INCOMPLETE AND SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE -- WHEN TEN FIFTY FOUR POINT NINE WAS FIRST ENACTED IT WAS AT THE PEAK OF THE INNOCENCE MOVEMENTS AND WE HAD JUST AS A STATE PASSED POST CONVICTION RIGHTS TO DNA TESTING? OUR DOORS HAD JUST OPENED -- AND ADD THE RAMPARTS SCANDALS HAD REVEALED THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING CONVICTED OF FALSE EVIDENCE OR FABRICATED EVIDENCE AND SO THAT LED TO THE BIRTH OF TEN FIFTY FOUR POINT NINE BUT THE RIGHT ONLY EXISTED FOR THOSE SENTENCED. TO LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE OR DEATH -- BUT THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS THAT REVEALED TO US IN THE INFANT INNOCENCE MOVEMENT IS THAT MOST OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SENTENCED TO FIFTEEN YEARS TO LIFE TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE AND SOME DETERMINATE SENTENCES. IN THE DECADES OR EVEN HUNDREDS OF YEARS BUT THEY FALL OUTSIDE OF THE PROTECTIONS OF TEN FOR THE FOUR POINT -- NINE SENATOR GLAZERS IT TOOK A LOT OF MY FOUNDER OF FOR FOR WHY WE NEED TO DO IS TO APPLY TO THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN COSTS ARE INCARCERATED. BUT I WOULD JUST ADD THAT AS THOSE OF US THAT OUR INNOCENCE LAWYER WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY AND REVEALING A POST CONVICTION CASES. WE APPRECIATE OF WHITES -- THIS REVIEW CAN DO TO THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF CRIMES -- AND SO ADDS TO SERVE THAT AND OUR REVIEW IS ARDUOUS AND AND THOROUGH -- BUT WITHOUT DISCOVERY. THAT COULD LEAD TO INCOMPLETE OR OR AT INCOMPLETE FILES ARE INCOMPLETE RECORDS ARE THAT COULD LEAD TO AN INACCURATE REVIEW OF THE CASE -- THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS IN SB SIX FIFTY ONE THAT CARRIED OVER FROM AB NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ONUS OF PROVIDING DISCOVERY DOESN'T REST ENTIRELY ON THE PROSECUTION. WE APPRECIATE THE RESOURCES CONCERNS -- FROM THE STATE -- BUT SB SIX FIFTY ONE AS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE 224% OF OUR PRISON POPULATION THAT ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED BEHIND A WRONGFUL CONVICTION -- OUR EXPEDITED IN THE PROCESS THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THE WRONGFUL CONVICTION AND EXONERATE THEM SO THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. NEXT WITNESS. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN PROUD SUPPORT OF SB. SIX FIFTY ONE AND THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND NINETY EXONERATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND LESS THAN THIRTY YEARS. MANY OF THESE CASES HAVE BEEN RIDDLED WITH RACIAL BIAS POLICE MISCONDUCT AND FLOOD FORENSIC SCIENCE. MOST OF THE EXONERATES CAME FROM COMMUNITIES WITH HISTORIC ACCESS TO JUSTICE PROBLEMS AND MORE THAN HALF OF THEM ARE BLACK OR BROWN. UNFORTUNATELY THESE CASES REPRESENT JUST A FRACTION OF THE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN PRISON IN CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT A FISSION ACCESS TO POST CONVICTION DISCOVERY THESE MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE WILL CONTINUE TO CLAIM PEOPLE'S LIVES WITH INNOCENT PEOPLE SPENDING EVER MORE TIME IN PRISON BEFORE WINNING THEIR FREEDOM. THEIR FAMILIES LOSING YEARS OF THEIR LIVES WITHOUT THEIR LOVED ONES AND THE SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS OF CRIMES AND THEIR LOVED ONES HAVING TO WAIT THAT MUCH LONGER FOR CLOSURE. SB SIX FIFTY ONE IS A REASONABLE RESPONSIBLE BILL THAT WILL HELP PROMOTE INTEGRITY FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE IN OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. WELL SB SIX FIFTY ONE EXPANDED POST CONVICTION DISCOVERY COULD INCREASE PROSECUTORS WORKLOAD SUCH EXPANSION IS CERTAINLY WARRANTED GIVEN WHAT'S AT STAKE AND ANY ASSOCIATED COSTS OR RESOURCES PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE COSTS AND RESOURCES USED TO INCARCERATE INNOCENT PEOPLE. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. SENATOR GLAZERS ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RESIDENTS HALLS WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. NICHOLAS CONTROLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT. LESLIE CALDWELL FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THE BEING ACROSS CITY WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH CHILDREN IN STRONG SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MORNING. FIFTEEN FIFTY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB. SIX FIFTY ONE WE'RE NOT ARGUING THE MERITS OF THIS POLICY HOWEVER APPLYING THE LAW RETROACTIVELY. PLACES A HEAVY BURDEN ON PROSECUTORS DUE TO THE SHEER VOLUME OF THESE CASES. OCCURRING DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO RESPOND TO A WHOLE NEW WAVE OF THESE DISCOVERY REQUESTS. THE LEGISLATURE'S IMPOSING NEW DUTIES ON PROSECUTORS WITHOUT ALLOCATING SPECIFIC FUNDS FOR THAT INCREASE. WITHOUT A SPECIFIC FUNDING MECHANISM WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR REACHING OUT TO US AND WE HOPE TO WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BEFORE IT GOES TO THE FOR MISS MATTHEWS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN CORRECT ANY OTHERS. ALL RIGHT COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BY OUR COLLEAGUES. YES SENATOR JACKSON'S YES I AM I SUPPORT THE THE THE THE POLICY HERE -- I'M JUST WONDERING WE JUST PUT THIS INTO EFFECT -- I SUSPECT THERE IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT COST IS I KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT COST BUT I'M JUST WONDERING -- YOU KNOW IF THAT IS. IF WE SHOULD BE GOING ESSENTIALLY FULL BORE ON THIS -- BECAUSE I I WANT. TO CAN I MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT -- ALLOWING OR REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO AND NOT TO I THINK BACK ON THINGS LIKE. PROSECUTING RAPE CRIMES OR CHILD ABUSE CRIMES AND THINGS WHEN THEY SAY WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. I DON'T WANT TO SEE US PUT IN THE POSITION WHERE. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE DA'S ANALOG SAYING HEY WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PRIORITIZE. AND THIS WILL COME BEFORE SOMETHING ELSE SO DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR -- ON HOW -- WE CAN BE SURE THAT THE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES AND PRIORITIES THAT WE SET FORTH FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE APPROPRIATELY -- PRIORITIZE WHAT THE SAME TIME DOING WHAT IS CLEARLY AN IMPORTANT -- EFFORT HERE. AND BE FOR YOU RESPOND -- CENTER GLAZER I JUST WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND. THAT THIS BILL. IS A BASICALLY A CORRECTION. TO A INADVERTENT ADMISSION IN A BILL THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR THAT MADE IT THROUGH A PROCS AND THAT WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. SO THE WHATEVER COST ISSUES ARE NOT NECESSARILY EXACERBATED BY. THIS -- ACTION BUT SENATOR GLACIER PLEASE PROCEED IT THANK YOU CHAIR SKINNER AND WOULD IT BE CORRECT THAT THAT LACKEY BILL THAT. WENT TO THIS COMMITTEE. LAST YEAR WENT THROUGH IN A FORM IN WHICH THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS WERE COVERED IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT YES AND WERE AND AND FI AND I MY STAFF COULD CORRECT ME BUT I DON'T WANT. TO MISS STATUS BUT IT CERTAINLY WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING AND IT WAS IN OUR ANALYSIS. THAT WE S. I WANT TO SAY ASSUME IT'S NOT A PROPER BUT RATHER THE ANALYSIS WAS BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PROVISION YOUR NOW CORRECTING FOR WAS. IT THAT IT WAS NOT IT. THAT THAT -- MISSION WAS. THAT WAS NOT CAUGHT RIGHT SO IN OTHER WORDS THE NOW SIS WAS WAS BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOW BRINGING TO LIFE. WAS ALREADY ACCOMMODATED COOKBOOK GO AHEAD. AND AND DISTRICT TO CLOSE ON THAT TO THE CENTERS GOOD QUESTION IT IS A GOOD QUESTION AND IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE A CONCERN OF ALL OF OURS -- BUT OUR ABILITY TO PUT OURSELVES IN THAT IN THAT PLACE OF JUDGMENT BY THESE INDIVIDUALS DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND OTHERS. IS A DIFFICULT THING WE HOPE THAT THEY IT WILL CARRY OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND FOLLOW THE LAW AND AND GO AFTER BAD PEOPLE WHO COMMIT SERIOUS ACT YOU KNOW CRIMES. THAT THEY'LL THEY'LL THEY'LL DO THAT AND BUT THEY WON'T THAT WE WON'T FOR SOME TO MAKE THESE TYPES CHOICES I KNOW THAT'S IN THE PERFECT WORLD AND BUT PRAGMATICALLY. ALL I'M TRYING TO DO HERE IS MAKE SURE THAT -- YES THERE'S A BURDEN ON THE PROSECUTION BUT THERE'S A HEAVY A BURDEN ON SOMEONE IN PRISON FOR SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T DIDN'T DO. AND THAT WE WE OWE IT AT WHATEVER COST TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THOSE RIGHTS -- TO TO DEFEND THEIR INNOCENCE THAT WHICH IS ALL THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO TO ADDRESS. ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION -- SENATOR GLAZERS LIKE TO CLOSE AT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ASTRONOMICAL RATE -- SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE WILL TAKE A ROLL CALL.

OKAY GREAT -- WHY DON'T WE CENTER MITCHELL WANT YOU PERCENT? AND THAT IS ITEM SEVENTEEN SORRY I SHOULDN'T. FORD CENTER THAT WAY BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT GOING CONSENT BUT I THOUGHT NOW LET'S GET THIS. SB. FIVE FIVE FIVE I APPRECIATE THAT MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COLLEAGUES TO THEIR PRESIDING SB FIVE FIVE FIVE WHICH WILL DO THREE THINGS IN SHORT. THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE COST OF COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND COMMISSARY ITEMS SOLD IN COUNTY JAILS SECOND WE WE HOPE TO PROMOTE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN JAIL CONTRACTS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND THIRD TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF THE INMATE WELFARE FUND IS PROTECTED. WITH THIS BILL OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENABLE STRONGER FAMILY CONNECTIONS THROUGH COMMUNICATIONS. WHICH CREATES A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF IMPROVING RECIDIVISM RATES FOR THOSE INCARCERATED. A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND CALIFORNIA ALLOWS EVERY. INDIVIDUAL COUNTY SHARE TO NEGOTIATE HIS OR HER OWN CONTRACT INDEPENDENTLY WITH PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE COMMUNICATION SERVICES TO COUNTY JAILS. THE CONTRACTS AND SERVICES ARE LARGELY UNREGULATED WHICH IS RESULT IN PRIVATE COMPANIES GAINING SIGNIFICANT PROFITS. OFF THE BACK OF THE INCARCERATED AND THEIR LOVED ONES. THE INMATE WELFARE FANS HAVE BEEN. IN SOME INSTANCES MISUSE FOR PURPOSES THAT DO NOT BENEFIT THE REHABILITATION OF INMATES AT HAVE BEEN INSTEAD USE WITH SERVICES THAT PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. AND THE COUNTIES SHOULD ALREADY BE PROVIDING. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH IN MAY WELL FOR FUNDS WERE USED TO PURCHASE SECURITY CAMERAS. AND TRANSPORT BANDS. TO THIS IN SB FIVE FIVE FIVE WILL DO THE FOLLOWING IT WILL LIMIT THE COSTS OF PHONE AND AN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AND THE COST OF ITEMS SOLD IN THE COMMISSARIES. IT WILL PROHIBIT CONTRACTS FROM INCLUDING COMMISSIONS OR OTHER INCENTIVES FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF CONTRACTS. IT WILL TIGHTEN THE PERMISSIBLE EXPENDITURES OF COUNTY INMATE WELFARE FUNDS AND WILL REMAIN THE COUNTY INMATE WELFARE FUND TO INCARCERATED PEOPLE'S WELFARE FUNDS. AT THE STATE LEVEL THE COMMISSION FROM THE PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE TELEPHONE SERVICES TO CDC ARE HAVE BEEN REDUCED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO SIMILARLY REDUCE THE COST OF PHONE CALLS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND TO EXPAND THESE COST REDUCTIONS OTHER FORMS OF COMMUNICATIONS. AS WELL AS THE COMMISSARY ITEMS SOLD IN JAIL. UP SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL WE'VE HEARD A BILL THAT I'VE CARRIED -- SENATE TO SKINNER'S KERRY WITH REGARD TO IN PERSON VISITATION IN COUNTY JAILS AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE DOZENS OF COUNTIES AND DOZENS OF JAILS ACROSS THE STATE. THE DONALD OUT IN PERSON VISITATION AND SELL FAMILIES ALREADY HAVE LIMITED COMMUNITY METHODS OF COMMUNICATION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T CONTINUE. TO PAY EXORBITANT FEES FOR EITHER THE COMPUTER SYSTEM OR THE PHONES. WE HAVE RECEIVED OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THEY WILL ARGUE THAT WE MAY DISQUALIFY CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE A BETTER OVERALL SERVICE AND INSTEAD PROMOTED INFERIOR CONTRACTED HAPPENS OFFER A SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE FOR PHONE CALLS. WE BELIEVE UNDER THIS BILL ANY CONTRACT WILL STILL MEET AND SHOULD STILL MEET THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF TECHNICAL AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS FOR SERVICES. THAT ARE OF APPROPRIATE QUALITY WE JUST DON'T THINK COMMISSION SHOULD BE MAYES ON A CONTRACT. AGAIN AT THE STATE LEVEL C. D. C. R. HAS ALREADY REDUCE THE COST OF COMMUNICATIONS FEES AND OTHER STATES HAVE ALSO JOINED FORCES INCLUDING NEW YORK AND TEXAS. IF WE DON'T REDUCE THE COST OF COMMUNICATIONS AND SERVICES THE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON FAMILIES AND FRIENDS OF THE INCARCERATED WILL BE FORCED TO CONTINUE TO LOSE CONTACT WITH THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS ON THE OUTSIDE. THIS LOSS OF SUPPORT CAN HAVE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING. MIDDLE HEALTH COMPLICATIONS WE TALKED ABOUT RECIDIVISM AGAIN. OPPONENTS MAY ARGUE THAT THE MEASURE ELIMINATES FLEXIBILITY ON HOW I W. F. FUNDS MAY BE SPENT DESPITE CURRENT STATUTORY PROTECTIONS INSURING THE RESULTING PROGRAMS. BENEFIT INMATES. AMENDMENTS THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE GOVERNING THE EXPENDITURE OF INMATE WELFARE FUNDS HAVE EXPANDED THE PERMISSIBLE USES THESE FUNDS FOR THINGS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE FUND'S ORIGINAL INTENT. FOR EXAMPLE SOME COUNTIES AGAIN HAVE BOUGHT. ITEMS SECURITY CAMERAS TRANSPORT BANDS THAT HAVE NO DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE INMATE. WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE FUNDS BE -- TARGETED AND USED FOR ITEMS SUCH AS VOCATIONAL TRAINING RECREATIONAL EQUIPMENT CLOTHING HYGIENE SUPPLIES FOR INDIGENT INMATES -- RELIGIOUS MATERIALS THOSE ARE APPROPRIATE SPEND IT YOURS CAMERAS AND BANDS ARE NOT. IN CLOSING HUMANS ARE SOCIAL IN NATURE WE CRAVE CONNECTION TO PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO CARE FOR US AND PARTICULARLY WHEN WE OURSELVES ARE PHILLY FEELING VULNERABLE ARE AT RISK OR ARE REMOVED FROM OUR COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES. WE KNOW THE JAIL IS NOT A PLEASANT PLACE AND THE ABILITY TO HEAR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE SISTERS VOICE. CAN BE YOUR SAVING GRACE. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE D'AMICO RODHAM RODNEY ROD OR MAIL DARNELL ROAD ARE MALE. WITH THE WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE AND A MAKE UP MODE OUT WITH THE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER WHO WAS FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES CONNECTING WITH HER LOVED ONES. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WITNESSES YOU CAN PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS THE MAKE OF MALTA I AM THE PRISON REENTRY DIRECTOR AT THE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND ALSO -- FORMERLY INCARCERATED WOMAN AND MAMA -- WE ARE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL TODAY -- I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SB -- FIVE FIVE FIVE THE THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. OF PLACES A HUGE FINANCIAL BURDEN. ON THE LOVED ONES IN SUPPORT SYSTEMS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE I'VE BEEN ON BOTH SIDE OF OF OF THE FENCE THERE I'VE BEEN THE INCARCERATED PERSON LEANING ON MY SUPPORT SYSTEM OUTSIDE. AND I'VE ALSO SUPPORTED MY HUSBAND LOVED ONES AND FAMILY MEMBERS WELL THEY WERE INCARCERATED AND NEEDED TO RECEIVE THEIR PHONE CALLS FROM HOME. WE KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW TYPICALLY IT'S LOW INCOME WOMEN OF COLOR THAT BEAR THE HEAVIEST FINANCIAL BURDEN WITH THE EXISTING SYSTEMS. WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED -- MY CHILDREN'S GRANDPARENTS FOR CARING FOR THEM. I WAS ALREADY LEANING ON THEM TO TAKE CARE OF MY CHILDREN AND AND THAT FINANCIAL BURDEN. AND MY PHONE CALLS HOME FROM THE COUNTY JAIL WERE ABOUT SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A CALL -- WE OFTEN HOW TO MAKE THE CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND PAY THE ELECTRIC BILL OR WHETHER THEY COULD ACCEPT A CALL FOR MOM. SO IDEALLY I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO CALL HOME AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK ONCE A DAY WOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL O KEEP CONNECTED WITH MY CHILDREN BUT WITH THE FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS OF WHAT WE COULD DO I COULD ON THE CALL HOME ABOUT ONCE A MONTH -- PHONE CALLS ARE THE NUMBER ONE WAY THAT WE STAY CONNECTED WITH OUR LOVED ONES WHEN WE'RE ON THE INSIDE -- THEY ARE SUPPORT SYSTEM. THIS IS HOW WE MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THIS IS HOW WE PREPARE TO COME HOME AND REENTER SOCIETY. I OFTEN HAD REALLY HARSH CHOICES TO MAKE DO I CALL ON MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY SO I CALL MY UNCLE PASSED AWAY. DO I CALL A WIN MY GRANDCHILD WAS BORN. IT WAS ALWAYS A CHOICE BECAUSE IT WAS A FINANCIAL LIMITATION OF HOW OFTEN I COULD STAY CONNECTED TO MY FAMILY -- I THINK THAT. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO TELL THE KIDS THAT WEEK WE CAN'T STAY ENGAGED BUT I CAN'T MOTHER YOU THE WAY I WOULD LIKE TO EVEN BEHIND BARS BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT -- THE COST OF COMMISSARIES ALSO REALLY HUGE IMPACT FOR INCARCERATED FOLKS AND LOVED ONES. WHERE ARE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO WORK IN THE COUNTY JAILS SO WE HAVE NO WAY TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILY MEMBERS TAKING CARE OF OUR FAMILY ON THE OUTSIDE? AND WE RELY ON OUR LOVED ONES TO ALSO SUPPLY THE BASIC NEEDS THAT WE NEED MORE INSIDE. OF YOU KNOW COMMISSARY PROVIDES REALLY REALLY BASIC -- SO -- DEODORANT THAT OFTEN CAUSE RASHES AND BURNS ON PEOPLE -- AND SO WE RELY ON FOLKS TO TO PROVIDE SOME MONEY FOR COMMISSARY TO BY THE MOST BASIC -- BASIC SUPPLIES ON THE INSIDE -- WE'RE REALLY CLOSE QUARTERS IN AN OPERATING IS PRETTY IMPORTANT IN THEIR ASKED SAY THAT YOU SUPPORT SB. FIVE FIVE FIVE AND RELIEVE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL BURDENS THAT ARE PLACED ON THE MOST IMPACTED AND MARGINALIZED. COMMUNITIES AND IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY TO OF HONORABLE POPULATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. COULD LATE MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAN A CO WROTE ARE MALE AND I'M ATTORNEY AT LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN SAN FRANCISCO -- MY LEGAL PRACTICE ACTUALLY CENTERS ON COMBATING CONSUMER ABUSES BY PRIVATE COMPANIES PROFITING FROM THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. AND AND WE ARE A VERY PROUD CO SPONSOR OF SB FIVE FIVE FIVE AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN INCREASED ATTENTION ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM CONTACT HAS ON OUR COMMUNITY. AND STARTING WITH FINES AND FEES WHICH I KNOW SENATOR MITCHELL IS ALSO WORKING ON THE SESSION -- AND NOW MOVING INTO CHALLENGING PRIVATE PROFITS MADE IN THE SPACE AND THERE'S ALSO CURRENTLY A NATIONAL EFFORT UNDER WAY TO REDUCE THE COSTS OF COMMUNICATIONS. FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN THEIR LOVED ONES -- INCLUDING IN NEW YORK CITY HAVING MADE PHONE CALLS FREE LAST YEAR AND A BILL IN CONNECTICUT RIGHT NOW THAT THAT SEEKS TO MAKE. ALL COMMUNICATIONS FREE ACROSS ALL CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN THE STATE. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ADDRESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR COMMISSARY COSTS WHICH AMIGAS SPOKE -- TO I JUST WANNA MAKE THE POINT THAT LIKE SHE SAID PEOPLE IN JAILS CAN'T WORK SO EVEN MARKET RATE. AT COMMISSARY ITEMS ARE TOO HIGH FOR PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN THEIR LOVED ONES TO AFFORD. AND AND IT'S OUR POSITION THAT IT'S JUST NOT APPROPRIATE FOR AT THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S MAKE COMMISSIONS OFF OF THESE SERVICES. AND THAT IT'S TIME TO RE EXAMINE OUR IN MAY WELFARE FUND AND CURRENTLY COMMISSIONS PAID TO SHARES BY THESE COMPANIES ARE DEPOSITED INTO THE INMATE WELFARE FUND WHICH WAS CREATED TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS FOR OF BENEFIT AND WELFARE OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE -- HOWEVER IT CURRENT ISSUES WITH THE I. W. F. OR NUMEROUS AND CHANGES IN A LOT HAVE MADE IT EASIER FOR THESE FUNDS TO BE USED IN A LOT OF OTHER WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE ACTUALLY THE TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN IWF REPORT FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY SHOWS THAT 57% OF THE EXPENDITURES FROM THE IWF WENT TO ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES -- FOR THE COUNTY JAILS WHICH INCLUDED SALARIES OF VEHICLES AT TRAINING OFFICE SUPPLIES BANK FEES CELL PHONES -- AND NETWORK COSTS. NOW I KNOW THE OPPOSITION'S POSITION IS THAT THIS BILL MAY ACTUALLY HARM INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN COUNTY JAILS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO REMOVE FUNDS. FROM THE IWF WHICH ARE USED FOR THE BENEFIT WELFARE OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE -- BUT AGAIN IT'S OUR POSITION THAT IT'S ALSO NOT APPROPRIATE. OR FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FUNDS TO BE MADE ON THE BACKS OF PEOPLE AT LEAST ABLE TO PAY THEM AND THAT IT ACTUALLY. HARMS PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IT FRACTURES RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND I LOVE ONES WHICH REDUCES SUCCESSFUL REENTRY. AND FINALLY JUST A NOTE THAT THIS BILL WOULD ALSO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE INMATE WELFARE FUND AND THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE'S WELFARE FIND OUT OF RECOGNITION THAT THE WORDS THAT WE USE TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE REALLY RAISING THE HUMANITY OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOU CAN -- JUST NAME AND INTO T..

PAPON CON I COULD YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE IT'S IN THE HALLWAYS BUT YOU WON'T FIND A PHONE INSIDE OF SO I'M I'M I I AS A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR AYE I HAD A REAL DIFFICULT TIME WITH THE CONTRACT PER WEEK. REQUIRED SUCH A HIGH PRICE FOR OUR PART. ARE THOSE INCARCERATED THAT HAD TO PAY FOR THE PHONE AND AND SO IN THIS IS THAT IT INDUSTRY THAT'S CHANGED I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS WHY. WHY ARE THE SHIRTS HANGING ON TO IT STILL CHARGING? SUCH A HIGH PRICE THANK YOU CENTER I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I THINGS ARE GOING HIGH TECH NOW SO WE ARE ACTUALLY OFFERING. KING OF THE FACE TO FACE COMMUNICATION FOR SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO SKYPE OR FAMILY MEMBER. DOES THAT SOUND IF THIS FACILITIES TOO FAR AND THAT FAMILY MEMBER -- WANTS TO BE ABLE TO SKYPE WITH THEIR WITH THIS THEIR LOVE ONE IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY DOES SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT OFFERED YEARS BACK AND NOW IT'S OFFERED. SO THOSE THINGS -- COST MONEY AND THAT MONEY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE TAKING WE ARE TAKING THAT I'M PUTTING IT INTO THAT. IN MADE WHILE FOR FUND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE INMATE WHO'S IN THAT FACILITY SO WHILE WE WITH WHILE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO HANG ON TO SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE PAST -- JUST BY VIRTUE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AND KIND OFFERED AT TECHNOLOGY TO INMATES WE'RE SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING WE SHOULD HANG ON SOMETHING. IN THE PAST BUT THAT THESE -- FUNDS THAT WE WOULD GET BECAUSE WE'RE OFFERING TO SERVICES TO INMATES SHOULD STAY IN THE IN MADE WHILE FOR FIND. TO ARE THEY ALLOWED TO HAVE A CELL PHONE. BEYOND OF COURSE NOT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE CELL PHONES NOW ARE THEY ALLOWED TO HAVE A CELL PHONE IN A LOCKER AWAY FROM THEIR CELL THAT THEY COULD USE TO MAKE PHONE CALLS. PURSES VISITS THEY ARE NOT. BY NOT. THAT WOULD BE WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT WITH THAT THAT EACH. SHERIFF IN EACH COUNTY TO DECIDE WHY HEY CHOOSE NOT. TO IT SAID IT'S A SAFETY RISK OKAY. I'M I'M I'M I'M JUST HAVING TROUBLE. I DID YEARS AGO IT JUST SEEMS TO JUST CHARGE SUCH A HIGH PRICE FOR THE USE OF A TELEPHONE AND I'M. HELP ME OUT I I I OTHER THAN IT'S A REVENUE SOURCE IT. I WILL PROVIDE IT WOULD PROVIDING A SERVICE AND WE'RE TAKING THAT MONEY AND GIVING IT BACK TO THE INMATE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT PROVIDING A SERVICE AND TAKING THAT MONEY. FOR FOR THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY PROVIDING A SERVICE TODAY IN MAY WILL BRING IT BACK SO THE IMEI CAN USE THAT FUND. TO PURCHASE WHAT THEY NEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MORE LIKE -- I WANTED -- TO ADDRESS MY FIRST COMMENTS TO OUR WITNESSES WHO I AM. HI. REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I CENTER WHICH BROUGHT THE BILL I FEEL THAT AND I'M SURE MANY COLLEAGUES AGREE THAT WE NEED TO EVEN DO MORE BECAUSE IT IS JUST RIDICULOUS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A SITUATION. WHERE? WE WOULD HOLD PEOPLE. AND THEY WOULD HAVE THE INABILITY TO CONTACT THEIR FAMILIES WE KNOW THAT WE ARE TRYING -- TO WITHIN OUR CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM. KIND OF BREAK THE CYCLE OF THE GENERATIONAL. CONSEQUENCES OF INCARCERATION AND OF COURSE IF A PERSON WHO'S A HEALTH. CARE NOT INTERACT WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS OBVIOUSLY FOR CHILDREN BUT OTHER PEOPLE TO HAS VERY VERY SERIOUS IMPACTS. AND THE TO SAYS MAKE ANY SENSE IN TERMS OF FOR ANY OF OUR MOTIVATION TO TRY TO BREAK THAT CYCLE. ON THE OTHER SAW AYE AYE A APOLOGIZE FOR YOU HAVING TO BEEN IN THAT SITUATION. AN EIN THE OTHER COMMENT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT. FOR THE SHERIFF'S WILL APPRECIATE THAT SHERIFF'S ARE LIKE WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS -- FIND BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE VERY LOW INCOME. FOLKS BEING HELD IN OUR JAILS AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM. MOST EVERYONE HELD IN OUR JAILS IS LOW INCOME. SO WHO ARE WHO WE CHARGING SOME TO THEN GIVE A FEW PENNIES TO OTHERS. I MEAN WE WE NEED TO GET PAST THAT [inaudible] AND THE I DON'T HAVE THE DATA DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME BUT PAST VAST MAJORITY. OF THE FOLKS HELD IN OUR COUNTY JAILS ARE LOW INCOME SO. TO THINK THAT WE WOULD USE THE CHARGES TO A FEW. AS THE WAY TOO AND THEN FIND SOME OTHERS IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I KNOW IT HAS BEEN THE PRACTICE I APPRECIATE THAT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. SO I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WITH AN S. WE HAVE TO REFORM AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SKYPE. YES THERE'S SOME MONEY -- TO GET SOME SCREENS BUT SKYPE ITSELF DOESN'T CHARGE I KNOW EVERY COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES GOT INTERNET ACCESS THEY WOULDN'T OPERATE WITHOUT IT. SO TO TO CHARGE MUCH FOR THAT. IS JUST PATENTLY ABSURD IN MY OPINION SO. I FEEL THIS IS A IMPORTANT STEP I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO GO A LOT FURTHER BUT I CERTAINLY AM NOT IN ANY WAY ADMONISHING THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS AND I HOPE THAT. AS WE LOOK AT ALL THE POLICIES RELATED -- TO ARE HOLDING OF PEOPLE AND IN OUR JAILS AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF CERTAIN OF OUR POLICIES AROUND THOSE WHO. DON'T HAVE MEANS THAT WE WOULD EVEN DO MORE -- SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU AND I TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE TELEPHONY AND INDUSTRY I KNOW WHAT IT COSTS TO GENERATE A PHONE CALL IT'S PENNIES ON THE DOLLARS AND IT'S ALMOST OBSCENE WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. WHEN I WAS IN ASSEMBLY AND I CHEERED UTILITIES OUT THE EXORBITANT RATE THAT COUNTY JAILS ARE CHARGING FOR PHONE CALLS EVEN WITH IN MAY TWO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE FAMILY WHO PUT MONEY ON THE BOOKS? IT NEVER COVERED. EVEN TO PUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH GETTING COVER THEIR PHONE CALLS AND CHEERLEADING. COVERING ANY CONCESSIONS TO LAST HIM THROUGH THE MONTH AND AS SENATOR MITCHELL'S CLEARLY STATED SOME OF THOSE. FOR A REVENUE IS GOING TOWARD. ITEMS THAT DON'T BENEFIT. THE PRISONERS SUCH AS A VANS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO IT DOESN'T COST AS MUCH FOR PHONE CALLS AND AS ARCHER ONE STATED TECHNOLOGIES REALLY GERMAN DOWN THE COST SO -- IT'S IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME SO. I TRULY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION MOLD. THE MOTION CENTER JACKSON IS THANK YOU YOU KNOW IT STRIKES ME TOO THAT -- IF THE GOAL OR NOT IF THE GOAL THAT THE GOAL THERE WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHEN IT COMES TO INCARCERATION IS REHABILITATION AND RE ENTRY. AND KEEPING PEOPLE FROM THEIR FAMILIES SEEMS TO ME TO BE SORT OF BACKWARDS WAY OF TRYING TO GET TO A RESULT THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. THE NOTION THAT PETE THAT THESE CHARGES ARE BEING MADE THERE THAT THEY'RE JUST -- RIDICULOUS AND I HI I THINK THAT IT'S TIME THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR INCARCERATIONS SYSTEM STARTED ASKING ITSELF WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO. TO ASSURE THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T COME BACK. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO IS TO TRY TO HELP THEM STRENGTHENED THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR FAMILY AND CERTAINLY WOMEN'S STRENGTH IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR CHILDREN. SO WHETHER OR NOT IT TAKES AWAY A FEW DOLLARS FROM SOME PROGRAM THAT ARGUABLY ASSIST -- INMATES -- IF WE STARTED LOOKING AT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OF THESE PEOPLE AS HUMAN BEINGS SO THAT THEY DON'T COME BACK. BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH NOW. THERE ARE OTHER STATES SOME OF THE RED STATES THAT ARE WAY AHEAD OF US ON THIS AND CERTAINLY OTHER COUNTRIES THAT RECOGNIZE THE NEED -- TO FOR RE ENTRY IN REHABILITATION AND TO STRENGTHEN THE BOND AT THESE. INMATES HAVE WITH THEIR FAMILY SO THEY DON'T RECIDIVIST. THAT NEEDS TO BE OUR GOAL THE FACT WHICH CHARGING SEVENTEEN DOLLARS FOR PHONE CALL. A IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS I MEAN. IT TOOK. I REMEMBER BEING IN COLLEGE BACK IN THE DAYS OF PAY PHONES AND I AT THE CALL HOME ONCE A WEEK. THAT WAS THE RULES. AND AND I DID AND YOU KNOW IT'S MUCH IS WHEN YOU'RE AWAY YOU THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT. THE PARENTS OF DOWN THAT ARE GOOD OR BAD OR WHAT HAVE YOU MAKING THAT CONNECTION EVEN JUST ONCE A WEEK WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND MAINTAINING A RELATIONSHIP AND I WAS ONLY IN COLLEGE NOT AND IN JAIL. SO -- I JUST THINK THAT WE'VE WE'VE JUST BEEN WRONG HEADED AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WRONG HEADEDNESS SO I WOULD HOPE. THAT. YOU WOULD DISCUSS WITH YOU FOLKS -- AND I APPRECIATE YOU WERE DOING YOUR JOB THE QUESTION REALLY SHOULD BE HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE THE CONNECTIONS THESE PEOPLE HAVE WHILE THEY'RE INSIDE. TO THE LOVED ONES IN THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE ON THE OUTSIDE SO THAT THEY DO NOT COME BACK. I JUST I HOPE THAT WILL START ASKING THAT QUESTION GOING FORWARD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION -- AND BEFORE A CALL ROLL CALL SENATOR MITCHELL DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE I ABSOLUTELY WOULD MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO DRAW -- EVERYONE'S ATTENTION -- TO PAGE TWO OF THE BILL SECTION ONE WERE WE CLARIFY THAT THE SALE PRICES OF THE ARTICLES OFFERED FOR SALE AT THIS STORE. SHELL BE OFFERED AT THE COST PAID TO THE VENDOR SUPPLYING THE ARTICLE SO WE'RE NOT ASKING THAT THE COMMISSARY ITEMS BE FREE. AND FOR THOSE OF US HAVE NOT BEEN IN COUNTY JAIL OR BEEN A POSITION WE HAD TO PUT MONEY IN THE BOOKS FOR ANYBODY WE HEARD TODAY FIRSTHAND ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS IN THE COMMISSARY. LIKE SOAP AND DEODORANT SO IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE I WANT. SOME FRITOS IT'S BASIC. ITEMS THAT YOU NEED -- TO EXIST AND WE'RE NOT ASKING THAT THE COUNTY INCURRED THOSE CALLS WERE ASKING THAT THE PROP THE COUNTY NOT PROFIT ON THE BACKS OF THE INMATES THAT'S NUMBER. ONE NUMBER -- TWO AS MADAM CHAIR SUBSCRIBE IT'S FREE AS WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS SPECIFICALLY WITH CDC OUR WISH IT WAS SKYPE THAT WAS AVAILABLE I DON'T THINK IT WAS SKY. IT'S PRIVATE COMPANIES TO OFFER THIS SERVICE AND I APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE THAT IT MAKES IT EASIER -- FOR PEOPLE TO VISIT AND WE HEARD TESTIMONY IN THE VISITATION -- ON THE VISITATION BILLS ABOUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MAY NOT LIVE IN AREAS OR HAVE A HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND SO THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS IS NOT CONSIDERED IN THIS FACTOR. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF WE'RE NOT ASKING THAT THE SERVICES OF THE PHONE AT THE KEEPING COMPUTER SYSTEM BE OFFERED FREE OF CHARGE. WE'RE JUST ASKING THAT YOU NOT CONTINUE TO PRICE GOUGE INMATES. THAT'S THE QUESTION. THE QUESTION AROUND AFFORDABILITY -- I LISTED YOU KNOW SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THAT THAT STATUTES SUGGESTS IT'S APPROPRIATE THE IN MUCH THE INMATE FUND PAY FOR WE'VE HAD A YEARS OF CONVERSATION AT THE CDC ARE LEVEL. REALLY TRYING TO EVEN TRACK TO FIGURE OUT HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR THAT HAS BEEN SHADY FOR DECADES. AND SO WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO SAY IS WE DON'T EXPECT YOU TO OFFERED FOR FREE. BUT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT IT'S MORE AND MORE AFFORDABLE WE CERTAINLY DON'T EXPECT THE COMMISSION'S BE MADE. THAT COUNTY SHOULD PROFIT OR BENEFIT FROM SIGNING A CONTRACT I DON'T KNOW THAT'S APPROPRIATE ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTACROSS THE BOARD. WE DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS COMMISSIONS PAID LEASE SIGN CONTRACTS FOR VENDORS FOR STATE SERVICES SO IT'S CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING THAT. INMATES IN COUNTY FACILITIES BE GIVEN SOME OF THE SAME PROTECTIONS WE HAVE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED FOR INMATES AT CDC OUR FACILITIES AROUND THE COSTS OF PHONE CALLS. THE COST OF INTERNET ACCESS PARTICULARLY SINCE -- OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL WE'RE STRONG OPPONENTS ON ON IN PERSON VISITING AND ONE IN THAT NOW THE BSE SEE DOESN'T REQUIREMENTS AND THE ONE OF THE TOP OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. SO NOW WE DON'T HAVE IN PERSON VISITS IN MOST OF THE JAILS ACROSS THE COUNTY CAN WE ALLOW PHONE CALLS AND AND INTERNET VISITS TO BE. QUALIFY AFFORDABLE. THAT'S ALL THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO STOP THE PRICE GOUGING I APPRECIATE SENATOR MORLOCKS PERSPECTIVE AS A MEMBER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND HAVING LOOKED AT THIS IN THE PAST. YES WE BENEFIT FROM NEW TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S BECAUSE OF SECURITY CONCERNS WE'VE ALL HEARD AS PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT CELL PHONES CAN BE ALLOWED IN PRISONS. SO THAT'S A LIMITED OPTION LET'S MAKE THIS THE LIMITED OPTIONS THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM AS AFFORDABLE AS POSSIBLE I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND BEFORE CALL RULE IF YOU ARE WILLING SENATOR MITCHELL IF YOU -- OR IF YOU ARE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS IN THE FUTURE I'D LOVE TO BE OUT IS A TOPIC THAT I'M SURE THANK YOU. LET'S DO ROLL CALL. MOTION IS THE PAST TWO IN OUR AYE MORE LOCK. WELL LIKE I BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. AYE MITCHELL AYE MORALE. WELL KNOWN WIENER. RIGHT SO WE WILL KEEP THE BILL -- ROLE OPEN BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME MISSING MEMBERS AND I'M GONNA ASK FOR A MOTION ON THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH WITNESSES REALLY APPRECIATE IT -- I'M GOING TO ASK FOR ROLL CALL. A MOTION EXCUSE ME ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR AND THEN I WILL PRESENT TO MYSELF. ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. WE WILL DO A ROLL CALL. SKINNER HI IN OUR AYE MOORLACH LIKE I BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE JACKSON FIVE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL [inaudible] MORALE. WELL I WIENER. WE ARE HOLDING THE ROLL CALL OPEN. AND THAT THE CONSENT CALENDAR RULES [inaudible] ALL. YEAH IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE COLLEGES FOR NOT GIVING YOU THE GAVEL CENTER MORE LOCK. I KNOW SOME THINGS ARE HARD TO GIVE UP. FOR USE IN -- SKINNER WE ARE NOW AT FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE SB THREE TEN YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANKS SO MUCH SO MEMBERS. ARE CONSTITUTION BOTH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL. SHE'S THAT WE HAVE. THE RIGHT TO A JURY OF OUR PEERS TECHNICALLY TO A TRIAL BY YOUR PEERS. BUT WE NOW HAVE SOME LAWS ON OUR STATE BOOKS. THAT. IN PRACTICE SHRINK THE JURY POOL AND STOP JURIES FROM BEING REPRESENTATIVE FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WITH A FELONY CONVICTION A PRIOR FELONY CONVICTION CANNOT SERVE ON JURIES. YOU CAN GET A FELONY. FROM [inaudible] GRAFFITI. FOR FROM IT DRUG OFFENSE FOR EXAMPLE FOR A PAST ADDICTION [inaudible] THERE ARE. MEN MANY CASES WHERE THERE ARE FELONY CONVICTIONS AND YET YOU CAN HAVE A PERSON. WHO IS BàN? CRIME FREE. LIVING WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY SUCCESSFULLY FOR DECADES AND YET STILL THEY CANNOT SERVE ON A JURY. THIS OF COURSE DISPROPORTIONATELY EXCLUDES PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM JURIES. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A STATISTIC IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN WITHIN CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON POPULATIONS WHILE AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA IS A WHOLE ARE ONLY 6% OF THE POPULATION. 30% OF THE MEN IN STATE PRISONS WERE BLACK. SO WHAT SB THREE TEN DOES IS CORRECT THAT. IT WIDENS THE POOL OF ELIGIBLE JURORS BY ALLOWING PEOPLE WITH PAST FELONY CONVICTIONS TO SERVE ON A JURY. IT ALSO EXPANDS THE LIST THAT CAN BE USED TO SELECT JURIES TO INCLUDE UTILITY RATE PAYERS AND STATE TAX FILERS. BECAUSE WE ARE HERE FOR MANY COURTS THAT THE HAVE DIFFICULTY -- GETTING ENOUGH PEOPLE TO SHOW UP FOR JURY DUTY AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY RESTRICTED SET OF LISTS THAT WE USE. TO POLL FOR JURORS SO THIS IS TO EXPAND THAT. AND IT ALSO REMOVES PRESUMPTION THAT THE LIST USED FOR THE THE LIST USED FOR JURY SELECTION IS A FAIR CROSS SECTION OF THE POPULATION. NO JUST -- FOR FOLKS THAT MAY BE THINKING ALRIGHT WHY. WHY SHOULD CALIFORNIA -- MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION OF ALLOWING A FORMER FELL AND TO SERVE ON A JURY WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS THERE ARE MANY STATES THAT DO SO COLORADO ILLINOIS MAINE OREGON JUST FOR EXAMPLE -- I WOULD LIKE MY WITNESSES TO NOW PRESENT I'VE GOT I DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING TO START WEATHER IS BRANDON WOODS FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE -- LISA JAMES FROM THE NEW WAY OF LIFE. DO YOU. OKAY GREAT. MISTER WOODS [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS BRANDON WOODS I AM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER ALAMEDA COUNTY. I'VE BEEN WITH THE ALBANY COUNTY PUBLIC FUNDS UP TO TWENTY THREE YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN THE CHIEF PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR SIX YEARS NOW. AND I CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW OFTEN I'VE SAID AT COUNSEL TABLE WITH SOME YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE WHO'S EXCITED TO TAKE THE CASE TO TRIAL HE'S A REALLY. ANTICIPATING A TRIAL AND THEN THE EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED COMMUNITY WALK IN [inaudible] AND EXACTLY. THAT PERSON THAT YOUNG MAN IS COMPLETELY DEFEATED. AND I SIT THERE AND I TELL THEM YOU KNOW. WE WE CAN GET A FAIR JURY TRIAL AND THAT HAS NO MEANING BECAUSE THERE IS NO WE'LL JURY OF HIS PEERS THAT EXIST HE LOOKS AROUND. AND HE SEES THAT. NO ONE WHO WILL BE SITTING IN JUDGMENT OF HIM LOOKS LIKE HIM. SO SB THREE TEN IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO FIX THAT PROBLEM. THEIR CURRENT RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. EXCLUDING PEOPLE FROM SERVING ON JURIES BASED ON FELONY CONVICTIONS JUST EXACERBATES THAT RACIAL SEVERITY. IN THE SYSTEM AND ALSO EXACERBATED MORE SPECIFICALLY IN THE JURY SYSTEM. AS YOU'VE HEARD [inaudible] 30%. FROM SERVING AS JURORS BASED ON THIS EXCLUSION ALONE. SO AT IT SAYS RIGHT NOW WE WOULD NEVER EVER CONSIDER PUTTING A LOT INTO PLACE. THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDE THIRTY IN A BLACK MAN. THAT WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE SYSTEM. IF THAT WAS THE CASE WE DO OPEN ARMS THEY KNOW WE COULDN'T DO THAT EXCLUSION [inaudible] SO. WHAT WE'RE SAYING? IS PRECLUDING OVER THIRTY CONVICTION FROM CERTAIN INJURIES EXCLUDES PEOPLE FROM COLOR. FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM. THAT WILL ACTUALLY. IMPOSE THOSE BURDENS THOSE PUNISHMENTS WAS FIGHTING FEES IN THIS VERY SAME PEOPLE. OFTEN WHEN YOU GO INTO JURY SERVICE YOU'RE ASKED TO BRING IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AND COMMON SENSE. AND WHAT WE ARE DOING. THEY'RE SAYING THAT WE DON'T VALUE THE EXPERIENCE OF COMMON SENSE OF EVERY PERSON. RE ENTRY NOW. IS A PREDOMINANT GOAL. OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE WE TALK ABOUT ALL TIME WE ENTRY AND PREVENTING. RECIDIVISM. WITHIN WEEKS ENTRY IS WITH INTEGRATION IN SOCIETY IF WE TRULYWANT PEOPLE TO RE INTEGRATE WE MUST MOVE THIS BARRIER. CIVIC PARTICIPATION. IS A NECESSARY STEP TOWARD REHABILITATION WE ENTRY AN INTEGRATION. REMOVING THIS AREA. WILL PROVIDE SOME LEGITIMACY TO OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WE CITY YOU CAN BUT WHAT IF ANY CONVICTION YOU CAN VOTE WHILE YOU'RE IN JAIL YOU CAN VOTE WHILE YOU WERE IN JAIL SERVING TIME FOR A FELONY. BUT WE SAY IN THE SAME BREATH THAT YOU CANNOT. DISSIPATE ANY JURY PROCESS AND ASSIST AS THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE THIS IS THE YOU HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH. RECENTLY THERE BEEN CASES. ON THE BOOKS ON THE LAW THAT HAVE JUSTIFIED SKOUSEN. AND THEY'VE DONE SO BY SAYING THEY WANT TO PRESERVE THE PURITY. PRESERVE THE PURITY OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. HE SAID THAT PEOPLE CONVICTED OF CRIMES WOULD DESTROY THE PURITY OF THE JUSTICE NOT SUCH A RACIAL OR TO THE PURITY WE KNOW THAT HARKENS TO IT GOES BACK TO WHEN JURORS WERE ALL WHITE. THEY WERE ALL MEN AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ABOVE AVERAGE LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE MORALITY AND INTEGRITY. WHICH WAS HOW MUCH TIME I'M JUST ABOUT DONE WRAPPING UP OKAY SO THIS BILL IS THREE IMPORTANT THINGS ALLOWS PHONE SEVEN JURIES. THE EXPANSE LISTA ALBERT JURORS. AND REQUIRES DEMOGRAPHIC COLLECTION I'M GOING TO DO ONE THING HERE -- THIS CAME IN MY MAIL BUT WE CAN HALF AGO. IT'S A JURY SUMMONS. AND WHEN I GOT IT I WAS EXCITED. I CAN PARTICIPATE NO IT'S GOING TO BE A PAIN OFF TO MISS WORK BUT I CAN PARTICIPATE IN A PROCESS. AS OF VIOLENT. WHEN YOU GET THIS YOU ARE TREATED IN OTHER? WORDS SOMEONE WHO CAN'T JUST BUT YOU WERE EXCLUDED FROM OUR SOCIETY. AND THIS IS A MARK. YOU CAN BE CORRECTED OF A PHONE FIVE YEARS AGO TEN YEARS AGO TWENTY YEARS AGO AND YOU CANNOT PARTICIPATE. SO. WITH THAT BEING SAID I'M ARE TO BEARD PRETTY TODAY. I AM HONORED TO ADVOCATE FOR SIMPLE CHANGE -- BRING BACK HUMANITY TO LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. NOT A TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY TO THANK YOU [inaudible] YES. THE MORNING OR AFTERNOON -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY -- IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY.

IN TWO THOUSAND BY IN FIVE MY VOTING RIGHTS WERE RESTORED. THIS GAVE ME A GLIMPSE OF HOPE. THAT MY LIFE WAS FINALLY HEADED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. SHORTLY AFTER I TO RECEIVE THE SUMMONS TO SERVE ON JURY DUTY. AND FOR SECOND MY HEART SKIPPED A BEAT AT THE THOUGHT A PLANE SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SOCIETY. I GENUINELY GOT EXCITED AS WELL. ONLY TO RECEIVE A LETTER REJECTION. THIS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE MORE MOST RECENTLY LAST MONTH. WHICH REMINDS ME OF THE LIMITATIONS I STILL FACE STEP THAT I HAVE SERVED MY TIME. I ASK MYSELF. WHAT DO I WANT THIS WORLD TO LOOK LIKE FOR MY CHILDREN? I WANTED TO BE FAIR. AND SAFE IN A WORLD SINCE RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE IN THIS CAPACITY WITH INTEGRITY IN FAIRNESS. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT I DO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO SIT ON A JURY OF MY PEERS [inaudible] AND DISTINGUISH [inaudible] BASED ON WHATEVER EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED. WHAT'S SAFE AND WHAT FAIRNESS LOOKS LIKE. FOR THIS COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS US ALL. I'M ASKING FOR YOU. TWO GIVEN AGBO ENABLED. ON SB THREE TEN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISTER JAMES ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THE CERTAIN COUNTIES IN THE STATE IT'S IT'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE THERE BEEN CHALLENGES BROUGHT OVER AND OVER. TO THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS IN SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES IN CONTRA COSTA IN SOLANO -- IN IN COUNTIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE DUE TO THE UNDER REPRESENTATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANICS IN THE JURY POOLS AND THE OVER REPRESENTATION OF THEM.

TO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. I HAVE A MOTION FOR THE BILL -- SENATOR SKINNER I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO STRIKE THE BALANCE BETWEEN. GRAYSON A SCARLET LETTER HERE AND I'M I'M WONDERING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE FELONY IT'S A BROAD CATEGORY -- WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS ON THE SEXUAL OFFENDERS LIST AND IT COULD BE. YOU'RE NEEDING OUTDOORS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE GIVEN THIS IS A LIFE SENTENCE AND I'M TRYING TO I SEE NO WELL CENTER WINNERS ACTUALLY DONE SOME WORK ON SOME DEGRADATION OF THAT LIST. WHICH I SUPPORTED I'M WONDERING IS THERE SOME KIND OF DEGRADATION WE COULD DO. FOR FELONIES SO THAT CERTAIN FELONIES ARE ARE FINE. MAYBE GOING INCREMENTALLY I GUESS IS WHERE I'M ASKING. WE CONSIDER THAT. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WE RESTORED THE RIGHT TO VOTE. SO THAT. THE PERSON WHO. I HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY BUT IS NO LONGER INCARCERATED. CAN VOTE NOW IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT AND WE DID NOT MAKE A TIERED. WE DO NOT SAY IF YOU HAD THIS PHONY YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BUT IF YOU HAVE THIS PHONE YOU COULD. SO I THINK WE'RE WE LOOK AT IT. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF IF YOU HAVE SERVED YOUR TIME. AND YOU ARE A LAW ABIDING PRESIDENT OF YOUR COMMUNITY. THAT THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR CITIZEN RIGHTS RESTORED. AND THAT'S THE MOTIVATION OF THE BILL. AND SO TO SAY THE MERE MENTION STATES LIKE COLORADO THAT HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS TO DEATH. DID THEY HAVE A TIERED SYSTEM OR THERE MAY BE -- ONE OR TWO STATES THAT DO -- BUT THE THERE AND THERE'S A COUPLE MORE THAT HAVE RESTORED JURY THAT I DIDN'T MENTION BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE MORE COMPLICATIONS BUT MAIN FOR EXAMPLE HAS NO RESTRICTIONS AND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THE OTHERS THAT HAVE NO RESTRICTIONS WHATSOEVER.
