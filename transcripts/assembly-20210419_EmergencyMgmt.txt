HI COMMITTEE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE INVENTOR OF SIT IN AND ABOUT THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. WITH UNIQUELY IMPACTED BY WILDFIRE. BROWN ESSENTIALLY AT THE LOCAL AD HOC PROGRAM THE ACT PASSED INVENTOR HAS LONG RELIED ON PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. FIRE AGENCIES IN THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. IN THE WAKE OF THE THOMAS FIRE MY COLLEAGUE MAX MORE THAN I PREDICT THE PUBLICATION THAT LEAN DOWN VENTURA COUNTY EXPERIENCES WITH THE ACT PASSED. AND PROVIDED A POOP BLUEPRINT FOR HOW OTHER COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE MIGHT ESTABLISH A SIMILAR PROGRAM. THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN JUST TREMENDOUS.

WHEN YOU'RE READY SIR GOOD. FOR CALLING FROM TIER THANK YOU FOR. WE HERE ARE AND- AS I START I WANT TO COMMEND MICHAEL DAYTON FOR HIS ANALYTIC WORK ON BEHALF OF THIS COMMITTEE THIS NEWLY LAUNCHED COMMITTEE SEVERAL COMMITTEE CONSULTANT I RECOGNIZE QUALITY WHEN I SEE IT- SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FARM COLLEAGUES I'M BRINGING AB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVENTY YOU AND IT'S ABOUT CALIFORNIA RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE. REALLY I'M SORT OF MOTIVATED BY THOSE FAMILIAR PHRASES THAT WE'VE HEARD SO LONG OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE. THE BILL IS KIND OF AN OUTGROWTH OF JUST RECOGNIZING THE STATE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IN THE CHARACTER OF TRYING TO PULL OUR PEOPLE TOGETHER IN A COMMON FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNANCE I THINK THAT IS. A VERY COMPELLING ISSUE PATIENT ANY DEMOCRACY AROUND THE GLOBE IN OUR ERA AND I THINK THE EVENTS OF LAST YEAR FOR DRIVEN AT. HOME EVEN MORE POWERFULLY. AND TO TELL YOU A STORY IN MY EIGHTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I HAVE THE LITTLE COMMUNITY OF PERIL. WHICH IS A FARMING COMMUNITY IN THE EXTREME SOUTHERN REACHES OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY. IT IS AN EXCEPTIONAL COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY LIFE AND HERALD IS JUST FANTASTIC. THE THINGS THEY DO TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER SUPPORT GOOD CAUSES TO KIND OF MAINTAIN THEIR COMMITTEE LIFE IS JUST SENSATIONAL. R. BUT FOR COVERT I WOULD HAVE BEEN A DOWN THERE AT SIX AM ON CHRISTMAS EVE HAVING A COMMUNITY BREAKFAST. WHICH THEY JUST SET UP OUT IN THE COLD IN THE MORNING IT'S JUST A GREAT TRADITION. OF BUT WHEN I. WAS ELECTED TO REPRESENT HERALD. I WENT TO ADVANCE AT THE OLD BARN. BY THE OUR FIRE HOUSE WHICH IS THE INDEPENDENT FIRE DIFFERENT BONTA FIRE DEPARTMENT. WHICH WAS THEIR ONE SITE THE TICKET EVERYONE INSIDE OUT OF THE COLD AND CONVENER OKAY COMMITTEE EVENT. AND IT HAS SINCE FALLEN INTO DISREPAIR AND ACTUALLY BEEN FIRE MARSHALS LOOK AT JUDGES NOT SAFE. COULD HOLD EVENTS. THIS SET ME TO THINKING ABOUT. THE GREATNESS OF OUR STATE AND OUR FIFTY COUNTY SENATE AREAS THAT HAVE ARE NOT ACTIVELY GROWING SO THEY DON'T HAVE A ROBUST STREAM OF REVENUES. AND THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO SUSTAIN COMMUNITY HEALTH AND LIFE. AND WITH THAT WEARING SINCE I SERVE ON THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION. YOU KNOW IT IS IN THE PARLANCE OF DISASTROUS BUT YOU'RE HERE AND REFERENCE IN SOME OF THE LITERATURE. TO THE NEED TO HAVE LILY PADS. WHICH ARE VIEWED AS SMALL AREAS. IN A SPOT WHERE THERE IS A HAS A REPUBLICAN CONVENE IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER OF MY OLDEST SON IS A PASTOR OF A CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ALLIANCE CONGREGATION AND IN PARADISE IT WAS A CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ALLIANCE CHURCH THEY HAVE A LARGE FACILITY IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUGE PARKING LOT. THE PROVIDED A VERY IMPORTANT STAGING AREA AS THE FIRE UNFOLDED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND SO THAT'S ALL SET ME TO THINKING AND THAT IS WHAT BRINGS THIS BILL TO YOU. HOW DO WE IN THIS TREMENDOUS STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FUNCTION AS ONE STATE. SUPPORTING THE BILL OF ALL OUR COMMUNITIES TO WATCH OVER THEIR WELL BEING. TO ENJOY THE COMMUNITY LIFE. AND EVERY SAVE FOR THE FUTURE. MOST RECENT DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES DEMOGRAPHIC JUNE SHOWS THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. TWENTY EIGHT OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAD EITHER NO POPULATION GROWTH. RUSSIA HAD POPULATION LOSS TWENTY EIGHT OF FIFTY EIGHT. ARM WHETHER FROM LACK OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY OR MOVES CAUSED BY WILDFIRES WHEN CITIES AND COUNTIES LOSE RESIDENTS AND OUR TAX BASE. THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCE AVAIL PAY FOR LOCAL UPKEEP SUFFERS. COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS WOULD SERVE TO HIGHLIGHT LOCAL CULTURE AS WELL AS PROVIDE ANY NUMBER OF DESIRE FOR A FUNCTIONS. INCLUDING SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS. ARE CONSISTENTLY UNDERFUNDED AND IN DISREPAIR. AND THAT'S NOT THE MEANT TO BE INSULTED IT JUST TO KIND OF SAY. IT'S WELL FOR US AT THE STATE LEVEL TO TAKE NOTE OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY AFFECT QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR RESIDENTS. LOCAL ROADS MAINTAINED BY COUNCILS HAVE YEARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHICH AFFECT POTENTIAL EVACUATION ROUTES FOR RESIDENTS. AS WELL AS CRITICAL ACCESS FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. SMALL TOWNS AND UNINCORPORATED ERRORS HAVE NO FUNDING MECHANISMS TO REPAIR OR BRING UP THE CODE. HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUILDINGS FOR THE COMMUNITY TO ENJOY. I KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE THEORETICALLY BUT I'VE SEEN THAT IN MY DISTRICT. AND IT PAINS ME. AB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN NICK RURAL CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE ACT. APPROPRIATES ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS FOR GRANTS TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS INDEPENDENT FIRE DISTRICTS OR COUNTIES WITH POPULATIONS LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND FOR RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS INCLUDING FOR GROUND MAINTENANCE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS HI WERE STREET MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OR HISTORICAL OR CULTURAL PRESERVATION REPAIR. IT PROPOSED THAT THE FUNDS WOULD BE OVERSEEN ALLOCATED BY COMMITTEE WITH APPOINTMENTS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. OF C. SACK AND THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WOULD HAVE APPOINTEES AS WELL AS FROM THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP. AND THE FOCUS WOULD BE UPON PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT GETTING DOLLARS TO PROJECT CAN HAPPEN NOW. FUNDS CAN ALSO BE USED TO LEVERAGE OTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR FEDERAL PROGRAMS. AND I BELIEVE THIS WILL ACTUALLY HELP WITH THESE TYPES OF CREWS DEAL WITH JUST PROJECTS WHICH- ARE. TOO BIG TO FIND LOCALLY BUT NOT SO BIG REALLY ACCESS OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS WAS REALLY. TO FOR THE STATE TO LOOK AROUND A STEP INTO A GAP. WHERE WE CAN RELEASE ENERGY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. OUR. I RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROMA NUMBER OF GROUPS SPECIFICALLY THE STATE BUILDING TRADES THERE OF COURSE ALMOST NO GROUP MORE DEEPLY INVEST IN THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THINGS A SUPPORTER QUALIFY FOR THE BUILDING TRADES THEY HAVE A KEEN INTEREST IN HOW THIS BILL WOULD WORK AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THEM REACHING OUT TO BE ALSO REGIONAL CULTURAL COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS ORGANIZATION. AND I INTEND TO WORK WITH ALL AND FOR SERVICE FOR THE BUILDING TRADES BECAUSE ARM. I CERTAINLY WANT- DEPENDABLE QUALITY IN AN EMERGENCY INVOLVED. IN OUR STATE WITHOUT AN VERGE FROM THE STATE RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER CONTINUOUSLY PUBLISHED LOSS OF AND I THINK IT'S A- I THINK IT IS A- ALL SOME STEP FOR US AT THE STATE LEVEL TO LOOK AT OUR- WHOLE STATE. AND ASK HOW CAN WE STEP UP AND SUPPORT THOSE RESIDENTS TO CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE MORE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE FUNDING CAN BE AN ISSUE. SO THAT THEIR DREAMS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND TO. ENJOY LIFE TOGETHER CAN BE SUPPORTED BY THE ENTIRE STATE OF SO I THINK IT'S TOUGH ENFORCEMENT AND THERE COMMITTEE BUT REALLY IN OUR DEMOCRACY. AW HERE TO TESTIFY SUPPORT I DO BELIEVE ON THE PHONE IS GOING TO BE JEFF NEAL. OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES FOR TURNER MISTER NEAL FEELS AVAILABLE NOW. PRAGER YOU HAVE- WHEN THIS IN SUPPORT. YES JEFF NEAL HERE MISTER CHAIR. HAPPY TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT IT THE FOURTEENTH FORTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. I'M WITH THE COURT THE BILL FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS- FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN BEEN WHAT'S A SURPRISE TO MANY PEOPLE- ALL THIS TO A COUNTY REVENUES HAVE HAVE- IN IN GENERAL IN MANY COUNTIES HAVE NOT BEEN GROWING. AT THE SAME WAY THAT STATEWIDE REVENUES HAVE PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE REVENUE SOURCE AND- PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE OF THE GREAT RECESSION- IF YOU TAKE OUT A COUPLE OF THE LARGE COUNTIES. THAT MANY COUNTIES IMPACT HELP LOWER PER CAPITA I TAX REVENUE- THAN THEY DID OVER TEN YEARS AGO- WHICH WHICH I THINK IS IT SHOCKING AND OF COURSE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY POINTED OUT. THAT MANY OF THESE COUNTY CIVIL IN NATURE- AND SO ON TOP OF THIS LACKLUSTER REVENUE GROWTH THAT MANY COUNTY SUCCEED- THE SIZE THE SCALE. OF THE DISASTERS THAT HAVE BEFALLEN MANY OF THE AREAS OF OUR STATE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT. AND IT YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S PROPERTY TAX REIMBURSEMENT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF- YOU KNOW A PROPERTY TAX SUPPORT. FOR FIRE AFFECTED DISASTER AFFECTED PROPERTY WHICH TEMA REIMBURSEMENT THAT THEY CAN HELP. OUT BELOW THAT SOMETIMES YEARS THAT COME IN BUT ASIDE FROM FROM THOSE AT MANY OF THESE AREAS ARE ARE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES IN THE WAKE OF THESE DISASTERS AND MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE TAX BASE TO. TO DO SO AS QUICKLY OR AS EFFECTIVELY. AS THEY WOULD LIKE. AND SO. HAVE KIND OF ISSUE. FOR THE FAIRGROUNDS THAT NOT A- THAT SERVER IMPORTANT ROLE DURING THE BECAUSE THAT. BUT ALSO IMPORTANT CULTURE HUB AT TIMES TO HAVE THE ASSISTANCE WITH THE- ROADWAYS. AS WE'VE SEEN THERE ARE OUT OF FUNDS LIKE THAT THE HIGHWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND A HIGHWAY BRIDGE PROGRAMS ARE TO ACTUALLY OVERSUBSCRIBED I THINK THERE'S- YEARS WORTH OF PROJECTS- THAT COULD BE FUNDED AT THE CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS IN THOSE. IN THOSE PROGRAMS. SO THE FUNDING THAT THE BILL WOULD REALLY GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING EACH. COMMUNITY BAND. THE BLUE RIBBON. THEMSELVES AND EDMUNDO SO WE ARE PRETTY. THIS BILL IN OUR TO IT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE. OPERATOR ANYONE ELSE ON THE PHONE SUPPORT. THEN LATE JUDGMENTS ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AGAIN ONE ZERO FOUR SUPPORT OF AB. FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN. WE DO HAVE ONE IN THE QUEUE TO BE JUST A MOMENT.

AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MR. THANK YOU AS OR ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION- VIA VIDEO. SINAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY WANTED THANK YOU FOR AUTHORIZING THIS IMPORTANT BILL ARE FOR GROUNDS- IN PARTICULAR ARE CENTURY NOW. DARK COMMUNITIES AT RISK. AND IN A CRISIS HAS BEEN PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I LOOK FOR SUPPORTING THIS BILL AT THIS TIME- JUST BRING BACK TO THEM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND QUESTIONS SUMMARY. THANK YOU- THIS CHAIR MEMBERS. MR COOLEY I LIKE THE SUBJECT LINE. RURAL CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE ACT AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING TO PUT A BILLION DOLLARS ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE GIVEN THE HUGE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME MONEY OR GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I'M NOT SURE THAT IS REAL CALIFORNIA'S FAIR SHARE SEEMS LIKE MAYBE A START. BUT- I WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAYBE START A LITTLE BIGGER HERE ON THE FRONT END IN ONE TIME MONEY- THE OTHER THING THAT. JUST GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN IS THE WROTE COVER INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEE. YOU'VE GOT AN APPOINTEE BY THE GOVERNOR. THE SPEAKER THE PRO TEM COUPLE MEMBERS FROM C. SACK. CALPERS LEAVE COMFORT CITIES. I MEAN I HAVE. LITTLE TO NO CONFIDENCE IN SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS PARTICULAR THE SPEAKER ON THIS DEMO IN THE WORST SPEAKERS FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA. IN SOMETIME SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED L. A. MEMBERS SAN DIEGO MEMBERS SAN FRANCISCO FOLKS APPOINTING PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO. DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE VALLEY WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO. I KNOW IF YOU'RE OPEN TO A BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE. MAYBE A CHANGING COMPOSITION TO THE COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO SEE. MAYBE SOME MORE SPECIFICITY- ITALY SOME OF THE BIG PROJECTS RIGHT WE PASSED A WATER BOND HERE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN- WITH THE PROMISE OF BUILDING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE MOST NOTABLY TWO BIG PROJECTS TEMPERANCE FLAT AND FRESNO INSIGHTS RESERVOIR NORTH SACRAMENTO NEITHER OF WHICH HAVE GOTTEN EVEN MOVE DIRT- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WE'VE GOT A REALLY POOR TRACK RECORD. WHEN WE LEAVE THE SPENDING UP TO OUTSIDE GROUPS WHETHER IT'S THE WATER COMMISSION IN THIS CASE IT'S THIS COMMITTEE THAT WERE ESTABLISHING- SO I GUESS. THE OVER THE TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE I'M START TO LOSE CONFIDENCE WHEN WE'RE NOT A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC IN OUR SPENDING CHOICES RIGHT AND I THINK WE'VE GOT A BUDGET PROCESS TO DO THAT. WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME GREAT MEMBERS RURAL CALIFORNIA SOME OF WHICH ARE ON THIS COMMITTEE- YOURSELF AND OTHERS WHO COULD GET INVOLVED IN REALLY LAYING OUT HERE'S THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS AND ENSURING EVERY REGION EVERY COUNTY GETS THEIR FAIR SHARE BECAUSE I JUST THINK- IN RECENT MEMORY WE'VE HAD. A RELATIVELY POOR TRACK RECORD OF FOLLOWING THROUGH. ASK THE TALKING POINTS OF A MAJOR STRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND AGAIN JUST TO FINISH UP. LOTS OF ONE TIME FEDERAL MONEY LOTS OPPORTUNITY. YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED AND ARTICULATED IN THIS BUILD LOTS OF NEED- AND YEARS OF. INADEQUATE INVESTMENT RIGHT AND- SO ALL THE LEVERS SEVERAL QUESTIONS ARE FOR YOU TO RESPOND TO BUT- IF YOU'RE OPEN LIKE TO THE COMMITTEE. CHANGE THE INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEE- COMPOSITION AND SOME MORE SPECIFIC PROJECTS- AND SOME MORE MONEY. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. CICILLINE. THANK YOU ARE NOT YOU KNOW I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF FAIRGROUNDS BUT WHEN I HAVE MY CONCERN IS THAT SAYS THE- ALL THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE A BILLION DOLLAR GRANTS TO SMALL COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. BLAH BLAH BLAH- FOR THOSE GRANTS ARE THEY GOING TO DO DOES THE COUNTIES HAVE TO MATCH THOSE GRANTS AND IF SO THAT'S IS VERY. TROUBLESOME TO ME BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY AND A LOT OF TIMES GRANTS YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A MATCH AND SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT PIECE OF IT. WITHOUT ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER QUESTION YEAH I THINK THE MEMBER FOR BRING IT FOR IT I MEAN THERE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE- INVESTMENT IN RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THAT I WOULD SAY ON THE ON THE TASK FORCE I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU TO ON. YOU KNOW WHAT WHO SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF THAT MY CONCERN ACTUALLY SEE SACK NOTORIOUSLY BEEN NOT VERY GOOD FOR RURAL COUNTIES- OFTENTIMES IS VERY MUCH. DOES A LOT OF THINGS FOR URBAN COUNTIES BUT RURAL COUNTIES OFTEN GET LEFT BEHIND- AND THAT'S ONLY CONTINUE TO BE MY EXPERIENCE SINCE I LEFT BEING A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND NOW BEING A LEGISLATURE SO I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE THE BEST ORGANIZATION- TO BE ON THE OTHER BUT IT OBVIOUSLY THAT THE INTENT HERE IS TO GET TO SOMETHING THAT. IS GOING TO PUT REAL MONEY INTO GREATER EVERLASTING OF SUPPORT OF THAT CONCEPT WOULD JUST LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT. ENTITY SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF AND- YOU KNOW HOW WE ENSURE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A REAL FOCUS ON ROLES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITHOUT A REPORT SUPPORTING THE BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I DO WANT TO SAY- FIRST OFF I WAS REMISS IN NOT GOING TO NOTING THAT MIKE CORCORAN THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE FRANK BIGELOW. OF WHOM I GOT TO KNOW BEFORE WE WERE MEMBERS- I WANT TO NOTE THAT PART OF THE. WAY A VERY EXPRESSWAY THE BILL IS DESIGNED IS. ONLY COUNTIES WITH POPULATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND UNDER ARE ELIGIBLE SO THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF CALIFORNIA THAT ACTUALLY IN A STATEWIDE PROGRAM ACTUALLY WRITTEN OUT OF IT AT THE BEGINNING- I WOULD SAY THAT MY INTERPRETATION OF HOW THIS WOULD APPLY. IS UNLESS YOU ARE IF YOU ARE AN ACCOUNTING OF THREE THOUSAND OR MORE. IF YOU HAVE AN INDEPENDENT FIRE DISTRICT. OR A SMALL SPECIAL DISTRICT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO APPLY BUT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO BIG COUNTIES- SO WE'RE ACTUALLY STARTED WITH THIS A RISK CONSTRICTED UNIVERSAL WHO WOULD BE THE ELIGIBLE COUNTIES I REALLY WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCE OF COAL OR THE WEATHER INTENDED TO GO. TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS. ON SAUDI TENDED. I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT I'M OPEN ON THE GOVERNANCE ISSUES I WOULD NOT WISH TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE BUT I THINK THE GENERAL STRUCTURE IS ONE THAT- WE USE OF SO MANY THINGS BUT I THINK THE- THE SUBSTANCE OF. THIS ACT WHICH LIMITS FOR THE DOLLARS COULD FLOW. SO I'M LESS CONCERNED ON THE ISSUE OF. WHO DOES WHAT APPOINTMENTS- AND THEN I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE WAY THE LAW IS STRUCTURED. OF. ASSEMBLY MAGYAR COREY OUR- LOCAL AGES AWARD A GRANT OF THIS CHAPTER. MAY ADDITIONALLY LEVERAGE FEDERAL OR PRIVATE FUNDING OR PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS TO COMPLETE THEIR PROJECT THE GRANT WAS AWARDED. FOR THE FUNDS THAT'S GREAT. BUT IT'S NOT IT'S LIKE THEY THEY PUTS THE PROJECT AT A SHOVEL READY THAT MEETS ONE OF THESE CRITERIA. AND I DO THINK THAT THERE'S ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT SHOULD THERE BE. OUR REFINEMENTS THAT BY TO COMPLAIN WATER PROJECTS THAT ARE DEEMED IMPORTANT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. R. DID- OUR STORM WATER WHICH WOULD BE SORT OF INTERTWINED WITH CLEAN WATER. BUT SO I THINK. I ACTUALLY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I STARTED A CONVERSATION MR BRICKELL LAST FALL ABOUT. AN IDEA THAT I THINK IT'S ONE THAT AS AN INSTITUTION WE COULD PUT OUR ARMS AROUND. I VIEW IT IS VERY MALLEABLE BUT I'D LIKE TO. I FACTOR REFLECT ON CHANGES BEFORE I MAKE THAT HAVE LONG WAY TO GO I ALSO YOU KNOW. I'LL SAY THIS FOR A NEW OF THE AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT A BILLION DOLLARS IT'S NOT A BIG NUMBER IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT IS FOR LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW. OTHER THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE- I PERSONALLY WOULD STRONGLY SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE. FINDING WAYS TO TARGET SUPPORT. TO THOSE CALIFORNIA RURAL COUNTIES. SO THAT THEY AT LEAST. THEY CAN FEEL GRUMPY FROM TIME TO TIME WHAT WE DO HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL BUT THERE ARE A PART OF OUR OUR STATE. AND I REALLY FEEL THIS BILL IS ABOUT PUTTING THE STATE GOVERNMENT APOSTROPHE RESPECT AND HONOR TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. ON FIVE LIKE THE I'D ADD TALKING TO VOLUNTEER PROGRAM THEY ARE NOT IS TO ADD TO MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE IS CO AUTHORS UNTIL WITH A LOT TO DO BUT. I DEFINITELY IT'S- TIED. THE OTHER FOR. ASYLUM ACTOR FOR. OPERAS LOCALLY TO THERE IS GRANTS UNDER THIS FOR TO LIVE OTHER FOR SOURCE TO PRO YES BUT AS TO. FOR THAT IS CORRECT. SUMMARY ARTICLE YEAH I JUST WANTED TO. DIALOGUE IT'S OKAY CHAIR SECOND WITH MYSTICAL BUT- I DON'T AGREE. TWO BILLION DOLLARS IS LAW OF MONEY IN MY YEARS RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA HAVE SUCH A ENORMOUS BUT SOMETIME IT'S WE LOOSE OF THAT I GUESS COMIC STRIP AT THIS BODY JUST MANY ORGAN AND A CEASE CITIES OR THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES. TEND TO GET DOMINATED BY THE URBAN MEMBERSHIP. RIGHT WE HAVE A SPEAKER FROM ALLY WE HAVE A PROTON FROM SAN DIEGO WE HAVE A GOVERNOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE REST OF US LIVE IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES AND OFTENTIMES ARE REPRESENTED. AND SO JUST CONCERNS ME THAT PEOPLE BRING. ATTITUDES AND IDEOLOGIES IN THE ROLE CALIFORNIA THE APPROPRIATE- PERFECT EXAMPLE WE'VE INCREASED OUR WATER. STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE BY 1% IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S A FACT MEMBERS SO WE'VE DOUBLED OUR POPULATION. AND WE'VE INCREASED OUR CAPACITY TO STORE WATER BY GOD THERE'S A DROUGHT HOW DO WE FIX IT HOME YOU MAY BE BUILT SOME INSTRUCTIONS ON. I SO I THESE FOLKS STEERING THE INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEE WALK ALBEIT YOU'VE LIMITED THE SPENDING TO THE TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES I GUESS THAT FALL UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS THAT RIGHT- THEY START ENFORCING COMMUNITY IT'S ARGUABLY QUESTIONABLE HOW WE COULD HAVE A RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE ACT WITHOUT A DAMMIT. RIGHT GIVEN OUR WATER PROBLEMS BUT I KNOW THE REASON THERE'S NOT A IN THIS PARTICULAR BILLS BECAUSE IT'S CONTROVERSIAL WITH URBAN POLITICS RIGHT NOT CONTROVERSIAL WITH THOSE OF US THAT REPRESENT RURAL CALIFORNIA FACTORS ARE. PRETTY IMPRESSIVE- CONSENSUS A REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT AND CENTRIST IN ROCK CALIFORNIA TO MOVE FOR WITH THESE PROJECTS BUT THESE OUTSIDE INTERESTS ALL WE DON'T WANT TO INVEST IN THAT IT'S HUNDRED CENTER SO THOSE ARE NOT JUST TO REALLY DRILL DOWN THAT CONCERNED THAT GIVES ME PAUSE SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND IN STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP AREN'T NECESSARILY. SUPPORTIVE OF OUR NEEDS AND THAT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO THAT I'M CERTAINLY PREPARED TO VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY AS IS WITHOUT ANY AMENDMENTS- BUT CERTAIN WOULD APPRECIATE REAL CONSIDERATION ON. HOW WE DON'T REPEAT THE EPIC FAILURE OF THE TWENTY FOURTEEN WATER BOND WHERE WE ALL GO TO A LOT OF HASSLE TO PUT TOGETHER A BIPARTISAN DEAL GET A LOT OF MONEY AND THEN THE MONEY SOMEHOW. YOU KNOW GOES TO THE- WATER COMMISSION AND GETS SIPHONED OFF BY LA AND SAN FRANCISCO TO OTHER. PURPOSES YEAH. SO AT THAT GONNA WE HAVE. A W. WE HAVE THE MOST AND SECOND. SECTOR THEN WILL TO MAKE MORE. DO WE MOTION. THE AMERICAN MACOMB HAVE A. SECOND BY SOME REWARD SO THAT SECRETARY CALLED. MOTION ISSUE PASSAGE ECONOMIC THE IN THE ECONOMY RATHER HI BUT I TO AYE SECTOR I AYE GUARD THE VOTING I GOT CARRYING OUT VOTING CALDERON RIGHT CALDERON I DOLLAR. GALLAGHER I GRADE.

WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MOVE THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MAY I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A BE ABLE HOW BUT YOU'RE THE PA YOU TO COMMISSION TO PLAY INFORMATION THE PUBLIC. SERVICE PROVIDER SEPARATES TO REPAIR SHE REPLACE NETWORK INTEREST OF EMERGE FOR DOES THAT. THE WILDFIRES OF THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHT HI MASS DEFICIT FOR PROPERTY TO TALK. YEAH DAMAGE. MANY REPORTED THAT THE PHONE WENT AND INTERNET SO WENT FOR A CELL TOWER WERE DAM AND UNDER BY LINES BURNED. IN TWO THOUSAND SO AND ON SURVEY FOUND THIS PER PERCENT OF CONSIDER COUNTY WELL FOR AFFECTED AREAS LOS PHONE THROUGH. JUST LAST YEAR THE TWO TWENTY THE GLASS FIRE REPORTED DAMAGETHE CAN. OF THE HOW JUST. IN FOR THROUGH IN THE AREA. IN% THE AFTERMATH OF THESE DEVASTATING FIRES THE STATE IN P. C. HAVE FOCUSED HEAVILY ON THE UTILITIES RESPONSE TO THE MASS OF DESTRUCTION. EVEN TODAY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE FULL IMPACT THESE NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE HAD ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND HOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES HAVE RESPONDED. THANK RECOVERY PLANS ARE NOT SHARED WITH THE P. C. OR THE LEGISLATURE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO OVERSEE THESE COMPANIES THAT REPRESENT THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. WE NEED THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT ARE HELPING IN THIS REPAIR EFFORTS AND NOT IMPEDING RESTORATION. AB ELEVEN HUNTERDON ELEMENT HUNDRED CARDS THE PC TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS EFFORTS TO REPAIR REPLACE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER THE EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS. I WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS BILL REQUIRED REPORTING IS NOT MANDATED TO MEET SUBMITTED DURING THE EMERGENCIES THEMSELVES BUT IT IS INSTEAD A LOOK BACK TO MAKE SURE GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR WORKING TOGETHER TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS IN THE SHORT TERM DURING EMERGENCIES. AND APPROPRIATE SERVICE TO SUPPORT LOCAL ECONOMIES AFTER THE DISASTER IN THE LONG TERM. AB ELEVEN HUNDRED ISN'T IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT STATE REGULATORS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS OR FORM TO THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE FAILURES. AND THAT WERE DAMAGED AFTER THE NATURAL DISASTER. WITHOUT INFORMATION REGARDING THE METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO REBUILD THERE IS NO WAY TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS HAVE THE SAME FOR IMPROVED ACCESS TO A RELIABLE NETWORK. FOR MORE MOST CALIFORNIANS RELIABLE VOICE TELEPHONE SERVICES NECESSARY TO REACH NINE ONE ONE. WITHOUT IT THE ABILITY TO CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES IS LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM FRANK OUTFIT AND I AM THE DISTRICT NINE VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA. YOUR CALL SPONSORED OF A BILL OF A HUNDRED. MR NINE COVERS CALIFORNIA NEVADA HAWAII AND GUAM WE ARE PERCENT WORKERS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY AND A BROAD SPECTRUM OF OTHER INDUSTRIES. WE ASK THAT YOU PASSED SB ELEVEN HUNDRED. TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIONS AND BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IS FULLY AND PROPERLY RESTORED FOLLOWING THE DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY. STATE OF THE WAY MEMBERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE SENT OUT TO COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WHAT THAT IS URBAN OR RURAL TO RESTORE SERVICE AND WE BUILD CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN THERE IS DAMAGE CAUSED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF EVENTS. OUR WORKERS ARE THE ONES TRYING TO GET FAMILIES BACK ONLINE AND BACK CONNECTION. OUR GOAL IS AND SHOULD BE TO ENSURE THAT EVERY HOME. EVERY HOME IS BACK UP AND RUNNING IN THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS POSSIBLE FOR LONG TERM SERVICE THE STATE ABILITY. TO OFTEN ARE WORKERS SUFFERED FROM CUSTOMERS THAT NOT. THAT NOT ONLY WITH THEIR SERVICE INTERRUPTED BECAUSE OF AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. BUT THAT THE SERVICE IS NOT BE STORED FOR PROLONG PERIOD. EVIL MANY OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS ARE BACK ONLINE. THE COMPANY'S TO PLAY THAT THEY THE FISH BACK UP POWER CAPACITY TO KEEP NETWORKS OPERATING DURING POWER OUTAGES. BUT ANY FIELD TECHNICIAN COULD TELL YOU THAT IT IS CRACKED UP FIXES ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. FOR EXAMPLE TECHNICIANS PHYSICALLY CONNECTING TO TERMINAL TO PROVIDE GENERATOR BACKUP BLIX DRONES AND MOBILE TOWERS ON TRUCKS. PROVIDE ONLY LIMITED TEMPORARY COVERAGE. NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR REAL BACK UP POWER AND CONNECTIVITY. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN WE MUST% ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE RESTORED FOR EVERY CUSTOMER. AB ELEVEN HUNDRED WILL LET YOU LAY THE GROUNDWORK TO ADDRESS HOW PROVIDERS WE BUILD WHOLE COMPLETED THESE AFTER DISASTERS. ARE THEY INSTALLING FIBER UPGRADES WHENEVER POSSIBLE WHO ARE THEY DOING THE BARE MINIMUM FOR PLACING OLD COPPER WITH NEW COFFEE FLAVOR NETWORK OUTDATED AND UNABLE TO MEET TOMORROW AND TODAY'S COMMUNICATION NEEDS. WE MUST ENSURE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES NETWORKS SHOULD BE REBUILT WITH FIBER ON THE CABLES INSTEAD OF COPPER. TOO MANY TIMES BUT TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAVE STONE UPLOAD BLOCKS TO STOP LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. WE OWE IT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ESPECIALLY TO OUR CHILDREN TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE WILDFIRES AND TO RESTORE ABILITY TO HOLD PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE.

THANK OPERATE WITHOUT TO DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM OR IN A WE DO HAVE SOMEONE IN THE ROOM. WITH THAT PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN BERNIE OROZCO WITH THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOM COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION R. C. C. T. A. IS IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE- WE FIND THIS- MEASURE TO BE A REDUNDANT AND A HUGE A SUBMISSION A REQUIREMENT FOR A LITTLE PUBLIC BENEFIT I THINK THE ANALYSIS DID A GREAT JOB IN LISTING ALL THE REPORTS THAT TODAY WE WERE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE WE HAVE TO FEDERAL REPORTS THE- THE JURORS IN THE NORSE REPORT NETWORK OUTAGE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT IT'S BECOME BY THE- BY THE FCC WE ALSO HAVE THE DERS REQUIREMENT THE DISASTER INFORMATION REPORTING SYSTEM REPORTS. THESE REPORTS ABOUT AVERAGES AND THE RESTORATION EFFORTS SO IN ADDITION TO THAT- THERE WAS LEGISLATION PASSED IN TWENTY NINETEEN THIS IS SB SIX SEVENTY WHICH ALSO REQUIRES NOT ONLY NETWORK OUTAGE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO REQUIRES WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FACILITIES HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO RESTORE THOSE FACILITIES AND WHEN WERE THOSE FACILITIES RESTORED. WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS REPORT THE REPORT BY THAT MCGUIRE LEGISLATION IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE FEDERAL REPORTS IS THAT THEY ARE CONFIDENTIAL SO I THINK WHAT'S MISSING FROM THE ANALYSIS IS ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS THIS INDUSTRY SECTOR IS ONE OF THE SIXTEEN SECTORSTHAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE PROTECTED AND THERE'S NO DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IN THIS SIR NGUYEN SB SIX SEVENTY PASS. LEGISLATION IMPLEMENTING THERE IS A SPECIFIC PROVISION IN THAT MEASURE THAT SAYS THIS INFORMATION MAY NOT BE SHARED OTHER THAN WITH LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS AND WITH THE NINE ONE ONE CALL CENTERS BEYOND THAT IT CANNOT BE SHARED SO I KNOW THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT THE PC CAN COME UP WITH SOME REGULATIONS AND RULES. AND ALTHOUGH WE WOULD OPPOSE THIS MEASURE MOVING FORWARD SHOULD THE MEASURE MOVE FORWARD YOU JUST SAY WHAT YOU MEAN AND MEAN WHAT YOU SAY IF IT'S CONFIDENTIAL JUST SAY IT'S CONFIDENTIAL THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN SB SIX SEVENTY AND. THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO HERE WITH THIS ONE TODAY. SO IT'S- WHAT ARE THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAS ABOUT THIS REAL TIME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ALTHOUGH WE MAY NOT HAVE TO SUBMIT A REAL TIME REPORT TO SOMEONE SIT IN A DESK IN SAN FRANCISCO WE STILL HAVE TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AND YOU COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AS THE DISASTERS GOING ON SO THIS REAL TIME DISCUSSION IS NOT REALLY- IT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS HAS ANY MERIT THAT IF YOU WERE TO DELAY IT. YOU STILL NEED TO DO IT SHOULD WE NOT SUBMIT THAT INFORMATION SHOULD WE MISS SOMETHING LATER ON IN A WE COULD BE PENALIZED FOR THAT SO. FAR OUR POSITION IS THAT. I THINK. AFTER YOU LIST ALL THE REPORTS ARE REQUIRED IN ANALYSIS THE ONE BIG MISSING PIECE WAS. WHAT IS BEING PROVIDED. IN THIS BILL. THAT IS NOT BEING PROVIDED IN THOSE OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AND I THINK ONE OF THE- ISSUES THAT WAS TOUCHED ON BY THE PROPONENTS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY. WHAT TECHNOLOGY DID YOU USE TO RESTORE THAT NETWORK NOW WHEN YOU PROVIDE NINE ONE ONE SERVICE. THE PC HAS JURISDICTION OVER WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF NINE ONE ONE WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF BASIC TELEPHONE SERVICE BASIC TELEPHONE SERVICE. IS ABILITY TO MAKE AND I WON ONE PHONE CALL. IT DOES NOT SPECIFY TECHNOLOGY IF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNMENT WERE TO GET INTO THE BUSINESS OF DECIDING WHAT TECHNOLOGIES MORE PART IS COPPER BETTER. THAN FIBER IS FIBER BETTER THAN FIVE G. IS FIVE YOU BETTER THAN SATELLITE. THAT'S NOT A POSITION YOU WANT TO BE SO- I THINK THE ONLY THING I SEE IN THIS MEASURE. WOULD BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO GO THERE IN A GIVEN OR DMV FIASCOS GIVEN ALL THE- CONNECT YOU KNOW COMPUTER GLITCHES THAT WE HAVE WITH CALIFORNIA THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A ROAD YOU WANT TO GO DOWN. FOR THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. OPERATOR THERE EVER ANY WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION ONLINE. AND LAYS IN GERMAN IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR OPPOSITION. AT THE TIME WE HAVE NONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR. OUR BRING BACK HERE TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS- ANY COMMENTS CONCERNS REMEMBERS. BY SHERRY OF A QUESTION COMMENT IF YOU. SO FAR AFTER NINE ELEVEN THERE WAS A HUGE EFFORT AND IT'S INTERESTING BEFORE THIS GENTLEMAN CAME UP TO SPEAK IS IN THE CONCERNS I HAD- AND THIS EFFORT WAS- THE INTELLIGENCE PART OF THIS AND IN OUR SECURITY OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND BEING ABLE TO AND THEY DEVELOP THE SAINTS COUGH J. RICK JOINT REGIONAL INTELLIGENCE HI COMMITTEE. AND THEY TRAINED A LOT OF FIRST RESPONDERS IN RECOGNIZING WHAT SOME OF THESE INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE WEAKNESSES CAN BE. AND THIS WAS ONE OF THEM. THIS IS ONE OF- WHERE. DAY RECOGNIZE THAT TOO MUCH INFORMATION TO THE WRONG PEOPLE. NOT ONLY LEAVES COMMUNITIES VULNERABLE- BUT IT ALSO- ENABLES. EXTENSIVE PLANNING- BY PEOPLE NOT MY HAVE NEFARIOUS IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. AND AND THIS IS THIS IS THE MAIN CONCERN I HAVE WITH THIS. IS THERE IS THERE IS A REDUNDANCY THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES COORDINATOR IF YOU SEE RIGHT NOW. AND THEY DO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION BUT THEY DO KEEP IT MORE CONFIDENTIAL- IF YOU CAN IMAGINE A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN HARD HIT. AND THEY'RE GETTING IN AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC OUT THERE IS GETTING CONSTANT UP UPDATES ON WHAT THEY'RE VULNERABILITIES ARE FROM A COMMUNICATION STANDPOINT- DOES BECOME TARGETS. FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND- AND- EITHER COMMIT YOU KNOW WHATEVER TYPES OF- YOU KNOW BURGLARIES ROBBERIES THAT SEPARATE SET TRAPS. AND THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE WITH THAT. IS ACT I THINK WE HAVE A PLACE AS A SYSTEM IN PLACE. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT NOW WE HAVE A COMMITTEE THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO COORDINATE SO THAT WE KIND OF HAVE AN IDEA. BUT IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE I THINK IT NEEDS TO STAY CONFIDENTIAL BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF OUR CRITICAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE- NO ISSUES HERE. IN THE END NOT ONLY TO CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE UNITED STATES. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M I'M A LITTLE I'M I'M I'M PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO OPPOSE IT FOR NOW AND- AND- YOU KNOW. IF THERE'S SOME. SOME ADDRESSING OF THOSE ISSUES IN BETWEEN NOW AND COME TO THE FLOOR- AND MY EARS ARE OPEN FOR YOU. THANK ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. JOHNSON WITHOUT COMMEMORATIVE BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I DO HAVE I RECKON I WOULD JUST CONTINUE IF THE BILL CONTINGENT BEFORE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH SEEMS TO BE COULD BE AN ISSUE BUT LONG TO CONTINUE WORK THEM I REALLY APPRECIATE IT SO WITH THAT ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE A MOTION. I WOULD BE SECOND WE HAVE A MOTION OF A SECOND- SUMMER. CALDERON HAS A SECOND SO WITH THAT SECRETARY CALDERON MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS RODRIGUEZ HI ARE YOU GUYS I THERE ARE STILL NO CERTAIN NO AGUIAR-CURRY HI I GOT A GREAT HI CALDERON CALDERO I GALLAGHER.

AB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE AND URGENCY MEASURE THAT WOULD INCREASE THE LEGISLATURE OVERSIGHT OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS ON EXPENDITURES MADE DURING A PROCLAIMS STATE OF EMERGENCY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL HELP BRING A CHECK AND BALANCE TO THE GOVERNOR'S BOARD BURDEN SHE POWERS. ASIDE FROM A THIRTY TO TERMINATE EMERGENCY BY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION THERE IS NO PROVISION IN THE ACT TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE OVERSIGHT. OF EXECUTIVE DECISIONS MADE DURING MARTIN C. THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO LIVE THE GOVERNOR THIRTY TO SWIFTLY RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES OR PURSUE FEDERAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE. BUT RATHER TO INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS AND SPENDING MADE DURING THOSE EMERGENCIES. PERSPECTIVES FROM A VOTE. THANK YOU MISS RODRIGUEZ DO WE HAVE ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NONE OKAY AND DO WE HAVE ANYBODY IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM. NOT I'M GONNA DO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS GO ONTO THEIR PRIMARY OPPOSITION IS THERE ANYBODY IN PRIMARY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.

MR GALLAGHER GO AHEAD YEAH I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR BRING FOR THIS BILL BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT- I THINK AS WE SAW VERY CLEAR LAST YEAR THERE'S A MUCH GREATER NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY- ON SPENDING DECISIONS ON YOU KNOW HOW THINGS ARE BEING HOW DECISIONS ARE GETTING MADE THAT AFFECT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND- ALL TOO OFTEN LAST YEAR WE WERE NOT GETTING THE ANSWERS THAT WE NEEDED- AND- SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS. FOURTEEN COMING BACK TO US. I ALSO THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT AND ENSURE THAT WE RETAIN GREATER CONTROLS- YOU KNOW OVER THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY POWERS- AND THAT YOU'LL TO MADE AS THE PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVES- THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ENSURE THE PROPER CHECKS AND BALANCES AND SO ON I MEAN I KNOW MYSELF AND OTHERS HAVE MEASURES TO. YOU KNOW SORT OF. RIGHT IN THE GAMUT FROM YOU KNOW LIMITING THE TIME FRAME FOR AN EMERGENCY- YOU KNOW TO OTHER REFORMS THAT WOULD HAVE NOTICED BETTER ENSURE THOSE CHECKS AND BALANCES SO I HOPE THAT WILL BE- IN THOSE BILL SHORTLY AS WELL- AND I THINK THAT THE COMBINATION OF HAVING BOTH. GREATER INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY AND REFORMS. YOU KNOW TO THAT EMERGENCY SERVICES ACTIVE THINKER ARE VERY MUCH WANTED SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND THANK THE CHAIR FOR. BRINGING THIS MEASURE. THE COMMENTS FROM OTHER MEMBERS. AND I'LL JUST OF THERE ARE NONE NOW OFFER A QUICK COMMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER HAS POINTED OUT- YOU KNOW THE EMERGENCY CENTRALIZING YOUR DECISION MAKING IN THE EMERGENCY AND THE EARLY STAGE OF EMERGENCY IS REALLY IMPORTANT- BUT- THERE ARE CHECKS AND BALANCES BURKE BELT IN ANY ORGANIZATION INCLUDING. THE GREAT STATE OF THE CAL OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT WE CANNOT AS A LEGISLATURE SIMPLY ABDICATE OUR ROLE- LONG TERM- IN AN EMERGENCY. THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE APPROPRIATELY MADE DECISIONS ARE PROPELLING IT MADE AN EMERGENCY- IN A CENTRALIZED MANNER BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT. ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR THAT. AND IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO- CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT WE NEED THAT ARE CALIFORNIANS RESIDENTS DEPEND ON- I THINK- WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT AND I THINK YOUR BILL GOES A LONG WAYS THEY'RE DOING THAT. I THINK THERE OTHERS SOME OTHER THINGS THAT CONGRESS IS DONE THAT MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT. AND HOPEFULLY WILL CONTINUE EXPLORING THIS- BUT WITH THAT- I RECOMMEND OUR DAY.
