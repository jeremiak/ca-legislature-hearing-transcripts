I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX SP ONE SEVENTY FIVE TO THE INACTIVE FILE. THANK YOU DULY NOTED. MEMBERS WERE MOVING TO THE DAILY FILE WE HAVE TWENTY ONE ITEMS THAT WERE HOPING TO GET THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. AND WE ABSENT AT THIRD READING AND WE'RE READY FOR OUR FIRST ITEM ITEM NUMBER SEVEN IS THE AUTHOR READY. FOR CENTER LEFT LABOR ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR ITEM. SEVEN MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE ROUTE SENATE BILL FIVE SEVENTY FOUR BY SENATOR LEYVA AN ACTUAL IN THE COSMETICS. SOONER OR LATER THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR ON DESIGNATED AND AUTHORITATIVE HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL LIST. TO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN PRODUCT INGREDIENTS OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PRODUCT LABELING LET ME REPEAT THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN ANY PRODUCT INGREDIENT OR REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PRODUCT LABELING. SB FIVE SEVEN FOUR ALSO PROTECTS TRADE SECRETS INCLUDING PRODUCT INGREDIENT FORMULAS SO THAT WE ARE PROTECTING VALUABLE RECIPES AND FORMULATIONS. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS IN CLEANING PRODUCTS THEN THOSE THAT WE USE TO CLEAN AND PERFUME OUR BODIES. PUT ANOTHER WAY WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THE FRAGRANCES AND FLOOR CLEANERS AND DISINFECTANTS THAN OUR SHAMPOOS DEODORANTS AND BODY SPRAYS. WE ALSO KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE FLAVOR IN CHOPSTICKS MOUTHWASH AND LIP GLOSS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. SO MEMBERS MY LITTLE LIP GLOSS HERE THAT I LIKE TO USE IT IS STRAWBERRY FIZZ FLAVOR I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE IN IT TO MAKE IT TASTE LIKE STRAWBERRY PHYS. CURRENTLY NO STATE OR FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR INGREDIENTS TO CONSUMERS OR REGULATORY AGENCIES NOT EVEN THE FTA. THIS LOOPHOLE ALLOWS CHEMICALS TO HIDE UNDER THE WORD FRAGRANCE FOR FLAVOR ON THE LABELS OF BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WAS LITTLE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. OF THE SAFETY OF THESE INGREDIENTS. YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF ON THE LABELS OF THE PRODUCTS YOU USE EVERY MORNING AND EVERY NIGHT. THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS ARE USED TO CREATE THE FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS THAT COMPRISE THE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT WE USE EVERY DAY. SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS RANGING FROM ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO REPRODUCTIVE HARM AND INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER. ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE AT RISK OF EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR CHEMICALS A RELATED CHRONIC HEALTH CONCERNS. PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS CHILDREN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND PREGNANT WOMEN. SB FIVE SEVEN FOUR I KNOW REYES VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL I APPRECIATE THAT. SB FIVE SEVEN FOUR WILL EMPOWER CONSUMERS TO MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH PRODUCTS TO USE WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. WITH THIS BILL WE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT CONSUMERS ARE WORKER AND WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT INGREDIENTS ARE IN THE PRODUCTS THEY BRING HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES. FIVE SEVEN FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ONCE AGAIN A NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEADER ON PUBLIC HEALTH. MEMBERS I AM COMMITTED TO ONGOING GOOD FAITH DISCUSSIONS WITH THE INDUSTRY AND WITH ADVOCATES TO DATE WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE INDUSTRY TO TAKE SEVERAL SEVERAL SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS. TODAY I AM COMMITTING TO SEVERAL ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE ADDITIONAL TRADE SECRET PROTECTIONS COMPLIANCE TIME AND IMPROVED IMPLEMENTATION. THESE COMMITMENTS RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE WRITTEN AND VERBAL AS CONCERNS OF pI WERE THE RESULT OF COUNTLESS HOURS OF GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS. MEMBERS SB FIVE SEVEN FOUR IS BROADLY SUPPORTED BY LABOR PUBLIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL MULTI ETHNIC IN CANCER PREVENTION ORGANIZATION. THIS MEASURE IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY DOZENS OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE FINDING SUCCESS IN DISCLOSING FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS. AS WELL AS UNILEVER THE SECOND LARGEST BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COMPANY IN THE WORLD MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION SB FIVE SEVENTY FOR THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY EMPLOYING MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN JOBS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHILE CONTRIBUTING. TWENTY EIGHT BILLION TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY. UNDER FEDERAL LAW PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COMPANIES DISCLOSE ALL INGREDIENTS ADDED TO A COSMETIC PRODUCT INCLUDING. ADDED FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR. AS EXPRESSED BY FEDERAL LAW FRAGRANCE AND FLAVORS ARE TO BE LABELED GENERICALLY AS FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR ON PRODUCT LABELS. WHY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE PROPRIETARY SECRETS OF THESE COMPANIES FROM? COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA THAT WILL THINK. TWICE WON'T THINK TWICE ABOUT COPYING. OF THESE FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS AND AND MARKETING PRODUCTS AND COMPETITION TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE. PATENT PROTECTION. THIS IS A REFLECTION ON THE FACT THAT FRAGRANCES OF FLAVORS MAYBE COMPRISE A SPECIFIC RECIPE. AGAIN WHICH COULD BE COPIED. EFFECTIVELY DESTROYING THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT. IN MY COMPOUNDING PHARMACY AYE COMMONLY USE FLAVORS SELECT AND GET CHILDREN TO TAKE. BETTER DRUGS -- ESPECIALLY IN CASES OF SOME VERY. RARELY USE ANTIBIOTICS THAT COULD SAVE THAT CHILD'S LIFE. THESE DRUGS ARE VERY BETTER IF YOU DON'T FLAVOR THEN THE CHILD IS NOT GOING. TO TAKE THEM IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN FRAGRANCES POWERSOFT FRAGRANCE -- CERTAIN -- FRAGRANCES THAT -- MAKE PRODUCTS MUCH MORE. APPEALABLE. IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL LAW THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS INDUSTRY FACES FURTHER INGREDIENT TRANSPARENCY AND CALIFORNIA UNDER THE CALIFORNIA SAFE COSMETICS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR DUPLICATES. THE WORK ALREADY BEING DONE UNDER THESE EXISTING CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES LAWS. AND SHOULD BE REJECTED. YEAH MY FRIENDS -- AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER [inaudible] ANOTHER HIT. ON MANUFACTURES NOT ONLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THE COUNTRY. THE DEATH OF A BILL LIKE THIS IS TO BE PROMOTED AND PASSED INTO LAW -- THE LABELING REQUIREMENTS ARE GOING TO BE SPECIFIC FOR CALIFORNIA BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THESE TRADE SECRETS ARE GOING TO BE LOST BY UNSCRUPULOUS COMPANIES -- THE DIDN'T DO THE THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO GET. SOME OF THESE -- FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS ON THE MARKET -- TO ADD VALUE TO THEIR PRODUCTS -- FOR THESE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE IN SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR THANK CENTER SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT -- BUT LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HEMA. I TO IN MY DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY CULVER CITY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COSMETIC MANUFACTURERS I'VE I'VE TOWARD THEM -- I USE THEIR PRODUCTS. BUT I THINK WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HUMAN MISSED IN HIS POINT ABOUT HOW THIS BILL -- WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE INDUSTRY. IS THAT THIS BILL OF BILLS LIKE AT OUR MEETING A DEMAND THE PUBLIC DEMAND THE PUBLIC WANTS TO KNOW. WHAT ARE IN THE COSMETIC? THAT WE USE. ON AND THAT STRUCK ME FROM. POIGNANTLY THIS YEAR IN HEALTH COMMITTEE WILL WE SAW BASED ON ONE BILLS SIMILAR TO THIS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE PAST. THE SHEER NUMBER OF NEW AND EMERGING A NEW EMERGING INDUSTRY IN THE COSMETICS INDUSTRY THOSE WHO ARE CATERING TO THAT PUBLIC DEMAND. FOR ORGANIC -- AT ANIMAL FREE TESTING AND ALL THE EXAMPLES ON THAT REFLECTED IN COMMITTEE THAT DAY AND SO WHILE WE THINK IT'S IT'S ONE SIDED TO THIS SIMPLY VIEW THESE. DISCLOSURE AND SAFETY BILLS AS INDUSTRY KILLERS WHERE THE INDUSTRY IS CLEARLY ADAPTING ACCORDING TO PUBLIC DEMAND -- I CAN'T REMEMBER FOR IN THAT LANE OFF THE BILL OR FIVE SUPPORTED IT HAVING EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN. AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING OVERTIME -- WITH MANUFACTURERS MANY OF WITH MANY IN THE INDUSTRY MANY. MANY WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION OF THE TIME -- AND WORKED ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I ARTICULATED SPECIFICALLY IN COMMITTEE. I AM CLEAR THAT POST HEALTH COMMITTEE SOME ADDITIONAL -- ISSUES HAVE COME UP BUT I HEARD YOU SAY IN YOUR PRESENTATION -- SENATOR THAT YOU ARE CONTINUING THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE DEFINITION OF INGREDIENTS AND THE DEFINITION OF TRADE SECRET I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE YOU AND THE INDUSTRY THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE TO ALLOW THIS VEHICLE TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE PROCESS. BECAUSE AS I SAID THERE IS A GROWING VERY VOCAL PUBLIC DEMAND FOR INFORMATION CRITICALLY FOR THOSE OF US WHO MAY USE MORE OF THESE -- ITEMS IN PRODUCTS THAN OTHERS -- FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE SUPPORTING SB FIVE SEVEN FOUR TODAY AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR -- THE PROCESS -- AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION A BIT ON THE SIDE ON SITTING HERE NINE SOONER LABOR WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO THINK THE SENATOR FROM LA FOR HER COMMENTS AND JUST ALSO SAY THAT YES I HAVE A LIST OF EIGHT COMMITMENTS. THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO WORK ON OVER AND TAKE OVER IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- TEMECULA I WANT TO REASSURE YOU THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO ANTIBIOTICS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE A LABELING MECHANISM AND IT. AND I ALSO WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU YOU'VE BEEN GENEROUS IN SHARING WITH US ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. SO MATURE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FAMILY -- ONE OF OUR DAUGHTERS IS PREGNANT WITH OUR FIRST GRAND CHILD AND I WOULD LOVE FOR HER SHE'S A PERFUME ME GAL SHE LIKES TO USE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS. I WOULD LOVE FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO GO ONTO A WEBSITE AND SEE WHAT IS THE INGREDIENTS ARE THAT ARE IN THE FRAGRANCES OF THE PRODUCTS SH USES. JUST TO BE A 100% SURE THAT WE'RE NOT HARMING THAT UNBORN CHILD SO MEMBERS WITH THAT I ASKED RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR THIRD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] ALLEN.

ELEVEN SENATOR RUBIO ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE UP THE SIDE. WE'RE GONNA PASS TEMPORARILY ON THAT AS WELL NEXUS FILE ITEM TWELVE BY SENATOR DORADO. ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE UP THIS ITEM SENATOR DORADO. WE'RE GONNA PASS. ARE YOU READY OKAY. MR PLEASE RATE SENATE BILL TWENTY NINE TO SENATOR DORADO AND ACTUALLY MEDI CAL. SENATOR ALSO [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR [inaudible] MEMBERS. FEDERAL LAW EXPLICITLY. AN UNJUSTLY EXCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AS WELL AS DHAKA. AND TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS TPS RECIPIENTS FROM RECEIVING HEALTH COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICARE ALL [inaudible] AND THEN. FROM SELECT THE AND I HEALTH PLAN OR PARTICIPATING IN COVERED CALIFORNIA. WHETHER THEY PAY FOR IT SUBSIDIES ARE NOT. AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY ARE NOT PROVIDED HEALTH CARE BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. AS A RESULT A MILLION AND A HALF UNDOCUMENTED BILLS ARE STILL LEFT WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. THEY CAN'T GET PREVENTATIVE CARE FOR ASTHMA DIABETES OR OTHER PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS. THEY RELY ON EMERGENCY ROOMS WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE TO PAY. FOR THEY RELY ON LAST MINUTE CARE. THAT IS NOT AN EQUITABLE WAY TO TREAT PEOPLE WHO WORK THEIR WHOLE LIVES REYES FAMILIES AND PAY THEIR SHARE IN TAXES. THEY WORK HARD TO MAKE OUR WINE INDUSTRY SUCCESSFUL. THEY TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN. LANDSCAPE OUR PROPERTIES TAKE% CARE OF THE ELDERLY AND THE SICK. AND THEY BUILD OUR HOMES AND OUR SKY SCRAPERS. THEY WORK IN TOURISM RESTAURANTS HOTELS THEY PICK THE CROPS FOR FRUITS AND FOR VEGETABLES. CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WITHOUT. THEIR HARD WORK AND CONTRIBUTIONS. I WAS LISTENING TO DOCTOR KING WHEN HE MADE A STATEMENT. ABOUT THE WAY AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE TREATED IN THIS COUNTRY HE SAID WE TREAT THEM AS A THING. NOT LIKE A HUMAN BEING TO BE RESPECTED. ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS OF THESE CALIFORNIANS HAVE LIVED IN THE U. S. FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS CAN TAKE THEIR CHILD OR GRANDCHILD TO SEE A DOCTOR WHEN THEY ARE SICK. BUT THE PARENT OR GRANDPARENT CANNOT DO THE SAME FOR THEMSELVES. UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS MAKE UP NEARLY 10% OF OUR WORKFORCE THEY CONTRIBUTE OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL AND STATE TAXES. YET THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE LIFESAVING SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THE DATE HELP. TO PAY. FOR HAVING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE MEANS FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC STABILITY FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES HIGH RATES OF UNINSURED ENDS IN A COMMUNITY CAN'T EVEN AFFECT THOSE WITH INSURANCE. AN INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT FINANCIAL PRESSURES ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN THESE COMMUNITIES. COULD LEAD TO LOWER INVESTMENT AND LOCAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AS WELL AS LOWER CONCENTRATIONS OF PROVIDERS. BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A SPILLOVER EFFECT UNINSURED RESIDENTS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE ALL BENEFIT WHEN EVERYONE IS INSURED. PROGRAMS THAT INCREASED COVERAGE RESULTED IN REDUCED PREVENTABLE HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AND LOWER DEATH RATES. HEALTH CARE FOR ALL SHOULD NOT BE JUST A SLOGAN. SB TWENTY NINE BILLS ON OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS COVERING THE REMAINING UNINSURED AND IS A BUILDING BLOCK TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO COVER THE REMAINING UNINSURED. THIS BILL WILL COVER A SMALL NUMBER OF UNINSURED. BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT NEXT STEP THIS BILL IS A SMART APPROACH TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR Mà AND SENATOR HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE TO SUPPORT SB. TWENTY NINE YOU KNOW AS A AS A SON OF AN IMMIGRANT WHO CAME HERE. NINETEEN FORTY NINE I CAME INTO A COUNTRY WHERE THERE WERE NO. LIMITATIONS ON IMMIGRANTS ABILITY GET HEALTHCARE. OR LIMITATIONS ON ABILITY CAN EDUCATION OR QUALIFY. FOR OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. YOU KNOW I I'M SAID THAT TODAY OF LOS IN OUR COUNTRY THAT TARGET SPECIFICALLY IMMIGRANTS. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS TO PAY TAXES THESE ARE IN INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE INTERWOVEN WITH THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY AND A WAY. THAT CANNOT BE UNDONE. BUT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY THERE'S NEVER BEEN. A HARDER PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. THEN THE IMMIGRANTS OF OUR OUR MODERN DAY -- UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY WITHIN OUR SOCIETY. BUT WE REQUIRE OF THEM. LONG. HARD WORK HOURS WE REQUIRE OF THEM [inaudible] OF REALLY. YOU KNOW IN MANY CASES LAWS DON'T APPLY TO THEM BUT THEY'RE OUT THERE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING FEED THEIR FAMILIES. LOT OF AMMAR POLITICAL REFUGEES LOT OF MORE ECONOMIC REFUGEES. YET WE WE TREAT THEM AS AS HAS. WE TREAT THEM AS IF THEY WERE CRIMINALS AND THEN WE WONDER WHY -- GANG SPRING UP IN OUR COMMUNITIES THERE ARE SO MANY HARMFUL EFFECTS TO THE WAY WE TREAT IMMIGRANTS IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY. THERE ARE SO MANY OF HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES THAT COME OUT OF THAT. IF WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE THEM A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP OF WERE ABLE -- TO PROVIDE THEM WITH. A DIGNIFIED LIVING AS A WORK IN OUR COUNTRY. LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS COME HERE SIMPLY TO EARN A LIVING AND THEY'RE HELPING TO DRIVE CALIFORNIA'S AMAZING ECONOMY THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL I WANTED. TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HAVING THE COURAGE BRING FORWARD AND I WOULD HOPE WE ARE NOT ONLY US SUPPORT THIS BUT ALSO FUNDS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. IT'LL MAKE OUR SOCIETY A BETTER SOCIETY MIDDLE MAKING SURE. THAT WE HELP CONTROL BAR HEALTHCARE COSTS AS WELL. SO THANK YOU MISTER MISTER PRESIDENT FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE SOME COMMENTS AND I URGE MY MY COLLEAGUES PLEASE VOTE FOR THIS BILL SO THE VERY IMPORTANT BILL. IN CENTER HUESO CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS. I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWENTY NINE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS. SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT. THE LEADING EMPLOYER IN THE SEVENTEENTH SENATE DISTRICT IS AGRICULTURE. THE SECOND LARGEST EMPLOYER IS HOSPITALITY TOURISM. THOSE TWO TOP EMPLOYERS IN MY DISTRICT RELY PREDOMINANTLY ON IMMIGRANT WORKERS. TO PRODUCE THE BOUNTY -- IN THE SURPLUS IN THE PROFITS THAT MAKE THE DISTRICT STRONG ECONOMICALLY THIS BILL. SIX TO EXTEND HEALTH CARE PROTECTION IN A MANNER THAT WON'T JUST SERVE. YOUNG ADULTS AND ELDERS. IT'LL SERVE ALLRESIDENTS FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. HAVING ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE CARE INCLUDING. IMMUNIZATIONS AND PREVENTION PROTECTS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. GERMS AND DISEASE DO NOT CHECK IMMIGRATION STATUS [inaudible] THEY SPREAD OUT WILL. COME IN IT'S THE INTERVENTION THROUGH PREVENTION. IN PUBLIC HEALTH -- THAT PROTECTS OUR BROADER COMMUNITIES. AT ALSO JUST CLOSE BY SAYING. THAT THE U. S. IS A SIGNATORY TO THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. ONE OF THE FROM THE NUMERATOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS THE RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE. BY THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE THAT BINDS US IN U. S. DOMESTIC LAW. SO VOTING FOR THIS IS ALSO A STEP FORWARD -- TO REALIZING OUR CURRENT LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO EXTEND HEALTH CARE TO ALL I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THIS IS -- ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE SSUES THAT -- IS RATHER CONTENTIOUS FOR FOR SOME OF US -- YOU KNOW THE PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND UNITED STATES FOR THAT MATTER -- EXISTS. THERE IS A LEGAL PROCESS THAT ONE'S GOT ONE GOES THROUGH. HOW TO BECOME CITIZENS LIKE MY GRANDPARENTS MY GRANDFATHER FROM RUSSIA MY GREAT MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER FROM POLAND MY GRANDMOTHER FROM CANADA? THEY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY LIKE. MANY OF THE HARD WORKING. IMMIGRANTS SO WE SEE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY TO TO FIND A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES. AND THE FOR THE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. BUT I STILL HAVE SOME SOME CONCERNS. ONE WE HAVE A MEDIC HEALTH SYSTEM I HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IS COMPLETELY DYSFUNCTIONAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] AND WALLEYE. VERY PROUD OF SERVING ON BUDGETS OF THREE WHERE WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION -- TO REYES THOSE FEES THAT WERE. CUT DRAMATICALLY -- BACK IN OUR GREAT RECESSION. WHAT WE PAY OUR PHYSICIANS TO TAKE CARE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OR A MEDICAL PROGRAM? IS STILL STILL SO SUB STANDARD. THE PHYSICIANS WON'T SIGN UP. TO TAKE THE PLAN MANY TIMES WE'LL SEE PATIENTS MANY OF OUR HUMANITARIAN POSITIONS AND IT ACOSTA MORE MONEY TO BUILD MEDI CAL THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GET BACK FROM MEDI CAL. AND AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THOSE HUMANITARIAN GESTURES. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BE -- HYPOCRITICAL [inaudible] AND SHOW FAVORITISM TO PEOPLE. THAT ARE NOT HERE LEGALLY AT THE EXPENSE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE LEGALLY. ONE OF THE BIGGER ISSUES THAT IS GOING TO BE VOTED ON IN THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS LETTER LEGISLATIVE SESSION IS. RE INSTITUTING A STATE VERSION OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. NOW I COULD UNDERSTAND IF. IF WE WANTED TO IMPOSE A SON. WEALTHY PEOPLE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE [inaudible] APPROPRIATE PREMIUMS. THROUGH OUR COVER CALIFORNIA BUT KNOW WHAT ARE WE DOING. WE'RE CHARGING SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE DOLLARS TO THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS AND THE WORKING CLASS CITIZENS OF THIS STATE. THAT ARE ALREADY LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. WHEN WILL WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR CITIZENS THAT ARE HERE IN THE COUNTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? DESERVE THE TOP PRIORITY FOR THE FUNDING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE CAN'T BE PHILANTHROPIC AND TO GIVE SERVICES. CAN HELP TO OTHER PEOPLE BUT MY FRIENDS WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE HERE LEGALLY FIRST. WE HAVE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE JUST LOS ANGELES ALONE. WE HAVE 25% OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS VETERANS WHICH TO ME IS SHAMEFUL. THERE SHOULD NOT BE A HOMELESS VETERAN AND ANYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY LEVEL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TEN THOUSAND HOMELESS VETERANS. IN AND SPENDING A BILLION STEP OF SPENDING A BILLION DOLLARS ON PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT HERE LEGALLY TO GIVE THEM HEALTHCARE WE SHOULD TAKE THAT TEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND AS A FIRST PRIORITY TAKE CARE OF THOSE. TEN THOUSAND VETERANS. THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US THEY GAVE A BLANK CHECK. FOR GOING TO WAR AND ULTIMATELY POTENTIALLY GIVE THEIR LIVES TO THE FREEDOMS AND LIBERTIES. THEY WILL CHERISH. IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT THE PROCESS OF GETTING IT CITIZENSHIP IS A VERY ARDUOUS PROCESS. IN THE UNITED STATES WELL THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS AND GREAT GRANDPARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY THE THEY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY THEY THAT ALL THE LEGAL PAPERWORK THAT WAS NECESSARY TO COME IN. BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED AT THE BORDER OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. IS NOT A MIGRATION OF PEOPLE INTO THIS COUNTRY BUT IT'S BEEN AN INVASION OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY. AND HI. SORRY IF I OFFEND PEOPLE WHEN I SAY THAT BUT IT IS AN INVASION OF OUR COUNTRY WHEN YOU DON'T PROTECT YOUR BORDERS. WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE FROM THE SOUTH PEOPLE FOR THE NORTH PEOPLE FROM THESE PEOPLE FROM THE WEST. AND PEOPLE THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S COUNTRY ARE UPSET ABOUT AND THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE UPSET ABOUT IT. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH MONEY TO GO AROUND. AND WE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING THOSE FUNDS. FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE LEGALLY HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE. THAT WANT TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY. TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS IS LIKE OUR FOREFATHERS DID IN COMING HERE [inaudible] LEGALLY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE. WE HAVE TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE COMING INTO THE STATE. MONEY THAT WASN'T ANTICIPATED. AND WE THROW OUT PROGRAMS. TO HELP THE HOMELESS THE POOR BROOKS OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE. AND I THINK IT'S VERY NOBLE THE WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE LESS FORTUNATE THAN OURSELVES. BUT IF WE GO WITH EVEN THE ASSEMBLY IS VERSION IT'S GOING TO COST THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO COME INTO THIS STATE. WITH FREE MEDICAL CARE. WITH EBT CARDS TO FEED THEM. WE ARE GOING TO BE [inaudible] A MAGNET. THAT IS GOING TO FURTHER ATTRACT. PEOPLE. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS RUNNING TO WILLING TO WRITE A BLANK CHECK. TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO COME HERE. AND WHEN WE DELUDE. OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THE LESS VULNERABLE THAT ARE LEGALLY HERE. I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE DOING A DISSERVICE. TO THE CITIZENS. THAT LEGALLY CALL CALIFORNIA HOME THAT ARE NATURALIZED CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES. I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE GIVING THOSE CITIZENS THE FIRST PRIORITY. DID TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND OUR BUDGETARY ACCESSES. AND IF AFTER WE SPEND THAT MONEY WE TAKE CARE OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATIONS WE TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS. AND WE PROVIDE QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS OUR RESPECTIVE OF THEIR OF THEIR NEEDS THE THEN WE SHOULD. CONSIDER OUR HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I RECOMMEND A STRONG NO VOTE IN SB. TWENTY NINE THANK YOU SENATOR ATTILA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WELL AS A VETERAN. I SUPPORT THIS BILL. AS THE AS MANIC AMERICAN. MEXICAN AMERICAN WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE TO COLLEGE THESE DAYS WE'RE ALL AMERICANS AND WE WE ARE AMERICANS WOULD REACH DOWN WE HELP THOSE THAT NEED HELP. THAT IS THE FOUNDATION OF THIS COUNTRY. AND I THINK THAT WE ARE HERE IN EVERY SINGLE DAY. THINGS ABOUT EQUALITY INEQUALITY THINGS THAT ARE FARE THINGS ARE NOT FAIR BUT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THIS ONE THING THAT'S ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN YOU HAVE POOR HEALTH. IT'S GOING. TO MEASURE INTO SOMETHING ELSE POOR HEALTH IS GONNA RESIGNATION THE SOMETHING ELSE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT. WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FACT THAT THEY'RE HERE AND WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT TAKING CARE OF THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS IN THIS BILL WILL OPEN UP THAT DOOR. MEDI CAL IS SO IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT PEOPLE FROM NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AND WE HAVE THE SENIORS THAT ARE SIXTY FIVE AND ABOVE. THE THE FACT IS THAT. THIS BILL WILL START TO FINALLY DO SOMETHING AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR STANDING UP AND HAVE THE INTESTINAL FORTITUDE TO FACE THE OPPOSITION THAT'S GOING TO COME NO DOUBT. BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SO MANY MORE OF US THAT REALIZE THAT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF SO MANY. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE AND WE NEED TO TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY. AND I KNOW IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE AN AMERICAN THERE'S NO DOUBT BUT WITH THAT PRIVILEGE COMES RESPONSIBILITY SO LET'S TAKE THIS ON AS A RESPONSIBLE BILL. AND I KNOW THAT A MY CONCERN AND I WILL SHARE THIS IS THE THE ESCALATION OF TIME. BUT THAT ESCALATION WILL BRING IN SOME OF THE OTHER NEGATIVE WHERE EVENTUALLY I HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE. TO INSURE EVERYONE AND WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT AND I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY SAY THAT WERE COMING TOGETHER. AND SO I HOPE ALL OF US CAN EXPLORE THE OPTIONS OF LATER EXPANDING THIS TO INCLUDE EVERYONE. AND AND I THINK THAT THIS IS OUR TIME. THIS IS THE TWENTY NINETEEN THEIR ISSUES OUT THERE BUT THERE'S NO GREATER ISSUE THAN HEALTH FOR CALIFORNIA POPULATION IN THIS IS THE FIRST STEP. SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. MISTER PRESIDENT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AMNEVER CEASE TO BE AMAZED AS A SITTING MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. AND THAT EVEN IS LIFE AS A BLACK WOMAN FIFTY FOUR YEARS FIFTY FIVE IN SEPTEMBER. I HAD TO COME TO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. TO HEAR SOME OF THE MOST RACIST CLASSES BANTER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TO ALL IS NOT NEW. IF YOU REFER TO THE FLOOR NOW SINCE WE AT LEAST SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE HAD THE SPECIFIC CONVERSATION BUT DATING BACK. TO TWENTY FOURTEEN SO WE CAN SEPARATE THE DISCUSSION. BETWEEN WHAT'S COST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHO'S WORTHY. I APPRECIATE MONDAY WAS VETERANS DAY -- AND WE LIKE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT VETERANS SHOULD BE DO. AND ISUPPORT THAT BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT ANYBODY DESERVES TO BE HOMELESS. VETERAN OR OTHERWISE. I'M NOT GOING TO PRIORITIZE A VETERAN OVER ANYONE ELSE'S HOMELESS. POINT BLANK. HOMELESS IS HOMELESS. AND IT'S MORALLY OFFENSIVE. THE TO THE ISSUE OF SB. TWENTY NINE WE ARE TALKING COLLEAGUES. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE OF FORTY MILLION. THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS. A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND OUT OF FORTY MILLION. PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE NOT IMMUNE TO GETTING SICK THEY WILL GET SICK. THEY WILL SIX SERVICES WE WILL PAY FOR THEM. THE QUESTION IS WILL WE PAY FOR THEM AND PROVIDE THE SERVICE. IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE. LEAST COSTLY SETTING. WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND YOUR COUNTIES IS NOT. WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR THE CITIZENS THE MIDDLE CLASS CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IN THE IN THE SENATE BUDGET? ONE POINT THREE MILLION OF THEM. WHO ARE OF MIDDLE CLASS INCOME WE'RE GOING TO RECEIVE A SUBSIDY TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR COVERED CALIFORNIA [inaudible] WICKS PREMIUM. ONE POINT THREE MILLION ARE GONNA GET HELP OUT OF YOUR CALIFORNIA BUDGET AN INVASION. IT'S INTRIGUING TO ME THAT AGGRESSIVE WORDS LIKE INVASION ARE ONLY USED IN REFERENCE. TO IMMIGRANTS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY TODAY AND I'M ASSUMING WE'RE REFERRING TO PEOPLE OF COLOR COMPARED TO WIN SOME PEOPLE FOR FATHERS IN FOR MOTHERS CAME THE LEGAL ROUTE. IT WASN'T AN INVASION THEN. THAT'S CURIOUS TO ME. BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT. TO THE INVASION OF PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. MISTER PRESIDENT I WILL GO BACK FOUR HUNDRED YEARS BUT IT WAS AN INVASION OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO WERE BROUGHT HERE AGAINST THEIR WILL. THAT WAS INDEED INVASION. SO. I TRIED TO TEMPER MY VISCERAL RESPONSE TO VISCERAL WORDS. SO LET ME SIMPLY SAY. THAT I WOULD ARGUE AGAINST THE NOTION. THAT THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM IS COMPLETELY DYSFUNCTIONAL IT SERVES ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIANS WHICH MEANS IT'S SERVING PEOPLE IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. BABIES ARE BEING BORN -- UP PEOPLE'S CONDEMN THE PEOPLE BEING HOSPITALIZED OF PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING TREATMENT THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL. PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY. CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST MEDICAID SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. COULD BE IMPROVED YES ARE WE DOING A BETTER JOB EVERY YEAR OF DOING THAT ABSOLUTELY. ARE WE NOW TO THIS BUDGET ADDING BACK IMPORTANT SERVICES TO FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES WE ARE. IT SERVES ONE IN THREE WHICH MEANS IT SERVES YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND MINE. THROUGH POP OF THE SIX AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE GONNA DO WE GET IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT THAT MEDI CAL PROVIDERS ARE AN INTEGRAL. PART OF THE DELIVERY OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ACROSS THE STATE. THEY TOO ARE RECEIVING -- THE BOUNTY OF A HEALTHIER GENERAL FUND AND THEIR REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE INCREASING. SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US IT LEADS US BACK TO THE POINT. OF WHO IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT. THIS NOTION THAT ONE GROUP OF IMMIGRANTS IS MORE WORTHY THAN THE OTHER IS A PHENOMENON TO ME. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR IF YOU HEARD. OF THE OFFICE PRESENTATION ABOUT WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO WORK EVERY DAY -- WORK WITH US FOR US ON BEHALF OF US. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM IN IT IN A STATE OF FORTY MILLION THAT NEEDS ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET. SO SENATE MITCHELL YOU BE SUPPORTING SB TWENTY NINE I WILL. WHY SENATOR MITCHELL? BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. AND THAT WE'RE EXPANDING. SERVICES TO A POPULATION THAT BUT FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM BASED ON THEIR INCOME. I WOULD LIKE TO BE OPTIMISTIC ENOUGH TO THINK THAT WE COULD INVOLVE AS A PEOPLE AS A BODY. TO THINK FACTUALLY. ABOUT THE NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS THAT WE ALL REPRESENT IN SIR. THE THING FACTUALLY ABOUT THE HEALTH NEEDS OF ALL OF THE RESIDENTS WE SERVE. WE'VE HAD VERY HEATED DEBATE ON THIS FLOOR AROUND [inaudible] BOB IMMUNIZATIONS. AND AND VERY. HEATED DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT? PORTION OF THE POPULATION NEEDS TO BE IMMUNIZED PROVIDE MASS COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. DOES ANYONE HERE HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF THE WILL OF THE STATE WORKING BUDGET OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. IT'S NOT AS HIGH AS IT SHOULD BE. THE ONLY TALK ABOUT PROVIDING COR. HEALTH BENEFITS. TO A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT WORKS EVERY DAY. HERE IN OUR STATE A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION AT ONE POINT IN TIME WAS INVITED TO THE STATE TO COME WORK BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE DO THE WORK. WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL. OF OUR OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT PROVIDING. HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO INCREASE THE OVERALL HEALTH STATUS. OF EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THOSE REASONS AND MANY MORE -- I WAS PROUD THAT. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS WE INCLUDED EVERY ELEMENT THAT'S IN THIS BILL I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR AMENDED HER B. L. AFTER THE SENATE VOTED ON THEIR BUDGET. THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE VOTE ON THE BUDGET AND SO IT'S IN ALIGNMENT TO WHAT CAME OUT OF THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE. FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE SUPPORTING SB. TWENTY NINE THANK YOU SENATOR -- TODDLE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB -- TWENTY NINE WITHOUT THIS BILL. MY CONSISTENT MY CONSTITUENTS WILL BE DEEPLY IMPACTED MY COUNTIES FRESNO TO LARRY KING AND KERN HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF MEDICAL ENROLLMENT. MY CONSTITUENTS ARE CONSISTENT CONSISTENTLY RELEGATED TO EMERGENCY ROOM CARE AFTER BOTH COMMUNITIES WITH AND WITHOUT COVERAGE MANY ARE FORCED TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA FOR CARE. WE CANNOT GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE OF LACK OF DOCTORS WILLING TO A SET MEDI CAL PATIENTS. SO I AM CLEAR THAT. THIS WILL NOT ADDRESS OUR NETWORK ADEQUACY ISSUES BUT IT WILL HELP MY CONSTITUENTS GET THE PREVENTATIVE CARE THEY NEED TO HELP AVOID A MORE SERIOUS HEALTH CRISIS. I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU ALL THAT HEALTH COVERAGE ACTUALLY HELP STIMULATE OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AS IT DID IN THE PERIOD AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PASSED. AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW NOT COVERING THIS POPULATION WILL IMPACT OUR HOSPITALS. CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY ONE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ARE THE COURT THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY CARE TO ALL. WHO NEED IT REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY OR INSURANCE STATUS? MOST PATIENTS IN A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ARE EITHER MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES OR REMAIN UNINSURED. PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS PROVIDE NEARLY THIRTY AND 40% OF HOSPITAL CARE TO THE STATE'S MEDI CAL AN UNINSURED POPULATIONS. RESPECTIVELY AND PROVIDE OVER TEN MILLION OUTPATIENT VISITS EACH YEAR. ALTHOUGH WE'D LIKE TO COVER AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE COVERED EVEN A PORTION OF OUR UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS OR YOUTH WOULD BE COMPARABLE TO THE COST OF COVERING CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF NINETEEN LIKE WE DID IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN OR WHAT WE PAY FOR AND COUNTY COMPENSATED CARE. AND FOR THESE REASONS. I'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR. FOR TAKING ON THIS. THIS BILL AND TRYING TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE FOR MORE PEOPLE IN THE STATE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR BILL. MEMBERS SO WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL THAT WE ARE -- CONSIDERING HERE TODAY AND TWO CLASSES OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE. FOR OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM [inaudible] THE SENIORS. AND A YOUNG ADULTS. AND I WANT TO ADDRESS -- HER TO GET FROM -- FISCAL STANDPOINT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION. THE FIRST THING I TO SAY IS THIS. IF YOU'RE A SENIOR AND YOUR ON DOCUMENT YOU ARE NOT GETTING MEDICARE. YOU'RE NOT GETTING MEDICARE HOWEVER. IF YOU ARE A SENIOR. AND HAVE LIVED IN STATE A CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES. AND HAVE WORKED. YOU ARE PAYING IN TO MEDICARE AND THEREFORE. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH A LOT OF THE SENIORS THAT ARE NOW. BEING REQUESTED TO RECEIVE OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM. IS THEY'VE BEEN PAYING INTO THE MEDICARE SYSTEM. FOR ALL THE REST OF US. WE ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED BY THEM. WE ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED BY THEM THEY ARE PAYING FOR OUR MEDICARE. BUT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RECEIVE MEDICARE. SO I HINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT THINGS IN A VERY -- LOGICAL WAY. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THE ESTIMATED [inaudible] UNDOCUMENTED. REVENUE COMING INTO THE MEDICARE SYSTEM IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS BUDGET. TO PAY FOR THE SENIORS AND THE YOUNG ADULTS COMING INTO THE THIS MEDI CAL SYSTEM. IN FACT WE'RE ALSO ALREADY PAYING FOR THE HEALTHCARE. AS POINTED OUT BY. THE WORK THAT WE DO IN OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ARE EMERGENCY ROOMS RE. CLINICS WHICH OFTEN TIME WITHOUT CHARGE PROVIDE THE MEDICAL CARE. THESE ARE ON COVERED OF UNREIMBURSED EXPENSES BY THESE CLINICS WHICH IS NOT A GOOD THING. SO I HIRED SUPPORT FOR THIS I THINK THAT. THE MONEY THAT IS PAID INTO THE MEDICARE SYSTEM. BY PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. HAS THERE PAYMENT OF TAXES. THAT THEY ARE NOT GETTING ANY BENEFIT FROM. AND THEREFORE WE ARE OBLIGATED. TO REIMBURSE THEM. BY CREATING A SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE FOR THEM. THAT SAVES NOT REALLY THEM MONEY BUT SAVES US MONEY AND RESULTS AN A A STRONGER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. FOR ALL OF US. YOU KNOW THIS OF LAST WEEKEND WAS MEMORIAL DAY AND AS USUAL -- OUR FAMILY WENT TO MY YEAH IT'S A GREAT. AND YOU KNOW MY DAD WAS A PARATROOPER AND MORE WORK. TO AND HE TOLD THAT HE FOUGHT WILL WORK TO FOR LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. AND HERE I THIS ASPIRATIONAL VIEW [inaudible] AND SUPPORTED. TAKING CARE OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN UNITED STATES. THAT'S WHAT A TRUE PATRIOT IS. AND WE THINK ABOUT IT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT INVASIONS ON OUR BORDERS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT -- IN A PATRIOTIC SINCE INVASION ON OUR BORDERS. BECAUSE INVITATIONS ON OUR BORDERS IS NOT THE KIND OF PATRIOTISM. THAT MY FAMILY OF SCRIBES. TO AND MY FAMILY. GOES BACK TO THE OFFICER THAT WE HAD IN MY FAMILY DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON. SO OUR FAMILY OUR FAMILY IS A VERY PATRIOTIC FAMILY. AND WE BELIEVE IN LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL [inaudible] PEOPLE. AND WE DON'T BELIEVE IN GETTING. OUR HEALTHCARE SERVICE ON THE BACKS OF OTHER PEOPLE. AND THAT'S THE ISSUE HERE I URGE AN AYE VOTE. LET'S PASS THIS MEASURE SENATOR ALL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WE TAKE A QUESTION SENATOR RUSSELL YES GRETA. THING WAS PRESIDENT CENTER YOUR BILL CONTAINS SOME ASPIRATIONAL LANGUAGE ABOUT. EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY -- EXPANDING COVERAGE TO THOSE IN THE TWENTY SIX TO SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD GROUP. AND I JUST OF YOU MAY HAVE MENTIONED THIS AND PERHAPS I MISSED IT I JUST WANT. TO MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR IS IT CORRECT THAT. ANY SUCH EXPANSION WILL REQUIRE FURTHER. ACTION BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE FORM OF A BUDGETARY APPROPRIATION ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME. GRETA THING WAS PRESIDENT -- I'M A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS -- OF THIS MEASURE -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. AND I CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE OF THE REST OF YOU TO DO THE SAME THANK YOU [inaudible] Q. [inaudible] SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- SENATORS SITE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I WANNA THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRING IT FORWARD -- WE WE LOOK WITH CERTAINLY WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS -- THIS BILL AND WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS HERE ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND IN OUR COMMITTEE HEARINGS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN FACT -- THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED -- ACTUALLY DIE. AND EARLIER AGE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET ILLNESSES -- BUT CERTAINLY IF THE HUMANITARIAN REASONS AREN'T THE ONES ENOUGH TO COMPEL PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL ALTHOUGH I HOPE CERTAINLY THAT IN ITSELF SHOULD BE. ENOUGH OF A REASON I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS IN YOUR SELF INTEREST IN THE SELF INTEREST OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS -- AS WHEN WE EX WELL FIRST OF ALL I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IN AND IT'S BEEN RESET HERE BUT I JUST HAVE TO BRIEFLY SAY AGAIN IS IS THAT -- PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH CARE NEEDS -- WELL EVENTUALLY WE WILL EVENTUALLY PAY FOR THEM NOW USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE PAY FOR THEM TO GET A LOT WORSE WE PAY THEM FOR THEM IN A MUCH LESS EFFICIENT MANNER -- FOR EXAMPLE -- I USE OF EMERGENCY ROOMS -- HOSPITALIZATIONS -- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO AS MUCH TO PRIMARY CARE TO OTHER -- PREVENTIVE MEASURES THINGS THAT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET CARE IN A MORE COST EFFICIENT AND HIGH -- AND AND MORE EFFECTIVE MANNER. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY. REALLY SAVING MONEY PER SE TO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS THAT WERE BASICALLY. SAYING THAT WELL WE'RE GOING TO THE NIGHT CHAIR UNTIL YOU GET REALLY REALLY SICK AND THEN -- WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TRYING TO SAVE YOU -- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IS NECESSARILY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF GOING ABOUT IT IN FACT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. WE ARE READY HEY. THROUGH OUR BUDGET THROUGH OTHER MEANS -- WE COUNT ON WE HAVE A COUNTIES REQUIRED THROUGH -- THERE'S INDIGENT CARE PROGRAMS -- TO PROVIDE CARE OUR CLINICS -- ACTUALLY OUR FELLOW QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS THE HAVE TO TAKE ALL COMERS ALTHOUGH ON A SLIDING SCALE -- AND THIS MAKES THE HOWARD [inaudible] BASICALLY. THIS IS A BAY AREA THOUGH TO PEOPLE GETTING CARE UNTIL THEY REALLY NEED IT. THE A IN ADDITION OF COURSE WE TALK ABOUT A LACK OF SPECIALTY CARE ACCESS AS WELL SO THAT SOMEONE GETS BUT YET THEY WILL GET IT EVENTUALLY -- WHEN THEY SHOP THE MERCHANTS ROOM WHEN THEY GET HOSPITALIZED AND THEN THAT COST BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE BORNE BY THAT INDIVIDUAL OR THE FAMILY? HARD AS IT MAY TRY TO ACTUALLY DO THAT THEN GETS DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL OF US. IN FACT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS BEFORE WE IMPLEMENTED THE ACA -- WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH DOES EACH. PRIVATELY SHIRT PERSON -- HAVE TO PAY TO HELP PAY FOR ALL THE CARE FOR THE PEOPLE ARE UNINSURED -- AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON -- WHO HAD PRIVATE INSURANCE? SO WE ARE PAYING FOR THAT I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT BY THE WAY THAT ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE UNINSURED -- ABOUT 40% CURRENTLY AFTER WE INFLATED CA ARE A DOCUMENT SO I SEE MAJORITY OF UNINSURED ARE ACTUALLY NOT THE UNDOCUMENTED. BUT CERTAINLY IT IS IN OUR SELF INTERESTS TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR HEALTHCARE DOLLARS. WE SHOULD ALSO THINK ABOUT THE SOCIETAL COSTS THAT HAVING PEOPLE LEAVING. THE NINE CARE TO PEOPLE LEAVING THEM UNINSURED ALSO ARE COSTS US IN SOCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THE LOST PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR WORKPLACES -- WE TALK ABOUT MEDI CAL OF ACTUALLY ASIDE FROM THE CHILDREN WHICH ARE HALF OF ALL MEDICARE OUR FATE. THAT HALF OF ALL CHILDREN MEDI CAL AND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED -- MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE MEDI CAL ACTUALLY WORK. THEY WORK AND SO -- THEY'RE PAYING TAXES YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ACTUALLY THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ABILITY CAN BE HAMPERED BECAUSE OF ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY SO. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE REASON TO VOTE FOR THE BILL IS NOT FEWER HUMANITARIAN REASONS. WHICH I HAVE -- IF THAT'S NOT COMPELLING ENOUGH IT IS ACTUALLY IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD ACTUALLY MAKE THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS WE SHOULD ACTUALLY SEEK TO MAKE EVERY PERSON IN CALIFORNIA AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE. AND WE SHOULD ALSO TRY THE LATEST SEEK TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD ON OUR SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE TAXPAYERS ALSO [inaudible] HEY. FOR AND SO WITH THAT I URGE IN AYE VOTES ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL BOTH BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S IN ALL OF OUR SELF INTEREST THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR GRANT SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU -- WELL FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT BILL FORWARD. I WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS BELABOR THE POINT THAT ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE EXPRESSED AS A PERTAINS TO THE BACK BASIC RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO BE HEALTHY IN OUR STATE. BUT I WILL SAY THIS. WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE I FIND IT OFFENSIVE THAT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY? TO MISREPRESENT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW I STAND BEFORE YOU AS AN UNDOCUMENTED. SUPPORT IT. SENATOR IN THE SAME ROOM YOU'RE ALL SET. AND WHEN I HEAR WORDS LIKE INVASION. IT REALLY IS OFFENSIVE. AND I WANT MY COLLEAGUES TO LOOK AT WHAT. SOMEONE LOOKS LIKE WHEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY. NOT ONLY FOR A GOOD EDUCATION. GOOD HEALTH CARE. AND SO I WILL SAY TO MY COLLEAGUE TODAY THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. BUT I HOPE THAT WE STOP. CONFUSING THE TWO HEALTH CARE IS NOT PERMISSION. TO BASH OR MISREPRESENT UNDOCUMENTED. IMMIGRANT INDIVIDUALS I FIND IT PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE AND I HOPE THAT THAT. STOPS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT I WILL BE VOTING YES. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES -- WELL I A WILL NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO BE AS ELOQUENT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM. LOS ANGELES. IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE REACTION FROM SOME OF THE FLOOR COMMENTS THAT WE HEARD EARLIER. I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO. AND WHILE I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THIS BILL. PURELY AND SOLELY BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I THINK THOSE THAT MAY HAVE EXPRESSED OR FEEL SOME OF THESE NATIONALISTIC OR XENA PHOBIC FEELINGS. SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE REST OF THE POPULATION WHICH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO REFERENCED. NOT ADDRESS BENEFIT FROM PEOPLE WITH COMMUNICABLE. DISEASES OR TREATABLE INFECTIONS HAVING THEM AND BEING AROUND OR NEAR US. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TIGHTENED UP. THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION AROUND VACCINATIONS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT. WE NEEDED VACCINATIONS FOR OUR GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH OF EVERYONE. SO IF WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON ABLE. BECAUSE OF LACK OF THE OUR COVERAGE OF HEALTHCARE. TO GET TREATED FOR EXAMPLE OR EVEN GO AND FIND OUT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TUBERCULOSIS. AND I SAY TUBERCULOSIS BECAUSE IT IS A MUCH MORE COMMON. DISEASE AMONG LOW INCOME PEOPLE. AND OF COURSE MUCH OF THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE THESE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER FOR THIS WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THIS BILL. OUR LOW INCOME. IN CALIFORNIA HAS HIGH RATES OF TUBERCULOSIS. IT IS A VERY CAN RECALL DISEASE. SEVEN FACTIONS MERCER. NONE OF US WANT. ANYONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES OUR SCHOOLS. OUR WORK PLACES. TO GET ANY OF THESE. IN YET OUR REFUSAL TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE. COULD CAUSE THAT. SO JUST FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH POINT OF VIEW THIS BILL MAKES SENSE. NOW LET ME ALSO TALK ABOUT THE BUDGETARY. IT IS FALSE FISCAL PRUDENCE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE COST ON THIS. AND WHAT OTHER THINGS WE MAY BE ARE SAYING NO. TO JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY ALONE ESTIMATES THAT. THE EMERGENCY ROOM CHARGES. THAT MAY RESULT FROM A PERSON'S LACK OF HEALTH CARE. SEE THE MEDICAL MEDI CAL COST FOR APPROPRIATE TREATMENT BY THIRTEEN TIMES. SO EACH INDIVIDUAL THAT WE DO NOT COVER THAT INSTEAD USES AN EMERGENCY ROOM. IT'S COSTING US THIRTEEN TIMES WHAT IT WOULD COST THEM US. AND ALL CALIFORNIANS FOR JUST PROVIDING WHAT'S IN THIS BILL ADDITIONALLY. THE MEDIAN COST OF THE ROOM VISIT IN CALIFORNIA IS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S THE MEDIA [inaudible] SO. JUST FROM A FISCAL POINT OF VIEW THIS BILL MAKES SENSE. BUT FROM A MORAL POINT OF VIEW IT IS ABSOLUTELY. THE ONLY AND RIGHT THING TO DO CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I AM A ONE OF THE FEW IMMIGRANTS ON THE FLOOR. I'LL LEAVE THAT SUBJECT ALONE FOR NOW. BUT I ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING ON THE CAL OPTIMA BOARD FOR FOUR YEARS I COUNTY OPERATED HEALTH SYSTEM AND IT TOOK QUITE SOME TIME FOR THE STATE TO FINALLY GET US THE NECESSARY AND ADEQUATE FUNDING THAT WE NEEDED. SO I'M CONCERNED MISTER PRESIDENT FROM A COST STANDPOINT AND I WILL. ADDRESS IT. OF FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THE GENERAL FUND AND WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR A WEEK AND A HALF NOW AND WE'VE APPROVED A LOT OF BILLS WITH A LOT OF HIGH TICKET. NUMBERS. IF WE'RE GOING TO DO BOND MEASURES -- WE HAVE TO FIND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR AND THAT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT THAT BE PAID. SO THAT'S GOING TO SQUEEZE OUT A LOT OF OTHER -- IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND I'M LOOKING AT THE CURRENTLY THAT [inaudible] ANNUAL. FINANCIAL AUDITS FROM ALL OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN AND COLLEAGUES THE NUMBERS ARE REALLY SCARY -- THIS YEAR. SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAD TO INCLUDE IN THEIR LIABILITIES THEY'RE UNFUNDED RETIREE MEDICAL -- LA COMMUNITY COLLEGE THERE UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT. FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION. BUT FOR THE NEW LAST REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT THERE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT. IT'S IT'S ONE BILLION. THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS IT IT IT'S GONE UP FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE OF THE RETIREE MEDICAL WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME SERIOUS. COST COMING OUR WAY. AS A BODY. THAT HAS TO LOOK AT BUDGETS FOR MANY YEARS. ONE THING ABOUT BEING A LITTLE OLDER. IS THAT YOU YOU KIND OF SEE HOW PEOPLE LOOK AT YESTERDAY. S. TODAY WILL BE TOMORROW. AND IF WE HAD A GOOD BUDGET. LAST YEAR AND WE HAVE TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION MISS YOUR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BLLION NEXT YEAR. AND AND COLLEAGUES I JUST WANNA TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE RECESSIONS HAPPEN. AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE TAKE ON THESE COSTS. AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE KEEP THEM IN THE BUDGET. IN YEARS MOVING FORWARD SO I I AM HERE TO CAUTION YOU. FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE. THAT CUMULATIVELY THIS COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT WHAT ABOUT OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS THEY'RE RELIANT ON OUR GENERAL. FIND WHAT WHAT GETS SQUEEZED INTO RECESSION GOING FORWARD SO WITH THAT. MISTER PRESIDENT I AM VOTING NO ON S. B.. TWENTY NINE THE QUEUE SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW MEMBERS ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS JOB IS OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT WE ALL BRING HERE TO THE SENATE FLOOR. AND FOR ME HEALTH CARE IS PERSONAL IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF FIGHTING -- FOR FOR TWENTY YEARS BEFORE I CAME TO THE SENATE FLOOR AS A LABOR LEADER. I REPRESENT A GROCERY STORE WORKERS AND I REMEMBER A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE USED TO SAY TO ME COUNTY YOU REPRESENT WORKERS THEY'RE NOT ALL HERE LEGALLY. AND I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S NOT MY JOB TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S HERE LEGALLY AND WHO ISN'T HERE ILLEGALLY MY JOB IS TO REPRESENT THOSE WORKERS THAT WORK AT THAT WORK SITE. IN 200-036-2000 GROCERY WORKERS WENT ON STRIKE TO KEEP THEIR FORCIBLE HEALTH CARE GUESS WHAT. ALL OF THEM WERE HERE LEGALLY BUT THEY WERE OUT THERE FIGHTING FOR THEMSELVES. AND FOR THE CO WORKERS. WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS PASSED IN WASHINGTON AND COVER CALIFORNIA STARTED? WE AT MY LOCAL UNION ALL BECAME NAVIGATORS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO HELP COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE HEALTH CARE. FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE CAME TO UFCW LOCAL FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT AND WE SIGNED THEM UP. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD HEALTH CARE FOR TWENTY YEARS. THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU AND I THEY DON'T LOOK VERY HEALTHY THEY'RE NOT IN GOOD SHAPE. OUR JOB AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WHETHER THEY'RE HERE LEGALLY OR NOT HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. BECAUSE I THINK OF US HERE ON THE SENATE FLOOR THERE'S FORTY OF US. AND IF NOT US. THEN WHO. IF NOT NOW. THEN WHEN. WHEN WE DECIDE THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS MATTER THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS BRING SOMETHING AND CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO OUR SOCIETY? I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SHE IN ORDER BATES. I THINK YOU MEANT ROSA MISTER PRESIDENT SORRY ARE. THE DEBATE ALWAYS SEEMS TO FOCUS ON THE EMOTIONAL ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION ANDI'D LIKE TO KIND OF SET THAT ASIDE AND SHARE A LIFE EXPERIENCE I BEGAN AS A SOCIAL WORKER IN THE EARLY SIXTIES AT THAT TIME. I WAS THE SUPERVISING CASE WORKER WHEN MEDI CAL WAS INTRODUCED IT DID HAVE A ROOT RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT OR TO HAVE A CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENT AT THAT TIME. UNDERSTANDING THAT WE NEEDED TO BE PROVIDING ABOUT TIED TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE -- THE IT HAS MORPHED OVER THE YEARS -- MY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS VERY SIMPLY THAT THERE'S AN ACCESS ISSUE IN OUR AND COMPLETELY SUPPORT THOSE WHOSE MESSAGE HAS BEEN ABOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. OUR I HAVE A BROTHER WHO'S VERY ILL WE'VE BEEN AN EMERGENCY ROOM TWICE IN THE LAST MONTH. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THE SERVICE IS POOR. IT IS POOR BECAUSE THE AVAILABILITY OF A SPECIALIST IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND DOCTORS IN PARTICULAR ARE NOT THERE THEY'RE NOT THERE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT REIMBURSING THEM APPROPRIATELY. SO I WILL CONTINUE -- TO REGISTER AND NO VOTE ON ISSUES LIKE THIS OF EXPANSION WE GIVE A FALSE PROMISE TO THOSE WHO GET MEDI CAL -- CERTIFICATES THEY CAN'T FIND DOCTORS THEY GET TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN A LESS HE IS VERY CLOSE TO THE END OF HIS LIFE. THEY PUT HIM IN A NURSING HOME I CAN'T EVEN GET OUT OF SOCIAL WORKER TO RESPOND TO ME. SO THERE ARE ISSUES WITH ACCESS DEFINITELY BUT UNLESS WE ARE -- ADEQUATELY REIMBURSING THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE ON THE FRONT LINES TO PROVIDE THAT QUALITY HEALTHCARE THAT WE ALL DESERVE DOCUMENTED UNDOCUMENTED YOU NAME AT CITIZENS YOU NAME IT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL HUMANS. ARE WE'RE IN THE SAME -- SITUATION HUMANITY HOT SO I WILL BE VOTING NO BUT I WANT VERY CLEAR THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE ACCESS ISSUE. IN THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE PEOPLE IN OUR GOVERNMENT HAVE FIRST AND FOREMOST RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES IN THIS WAR FOR GOOD HEALTH CARE ARE ADEQUATELY REIMBURSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR JACKSON'S VERY BRIEFLY I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM LAGUNA FOR RECOGNIZING THAT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS HUMAN BEINGS AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN PART OF WHAT MAKES THIS SUCH A DIFFICULT AND FRUSTRATING DISCUSSION. BECAUSE I TOO HAVE BEEN RECENTLY IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM. THE END I HAVE BEEN SHOCKED. AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHETHER TO DAY OR NIGHT PEOPLE LINED UP FOR EMERGENCY ROOM CARE. AND THE THE LACK OF PHYSICIANS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHO ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT CARE AND FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHO ARE IN THOSE EMERGENCY ROOMS IN TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SHAPE AND AS WAS POINTED OUT BY THE COULD CALLING FROM? CHINO. ARE FREQUENTLY THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER WHO HAVEN'T HAD HEALTH CARE. THERE FIFTY YEARS OLD THEY LOOK AT. THEY ARE THEY ARE SUFFERING. THE END THERE WERE AND THEY HAVE TO WAIT HOURS BECAUSE OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE JUST TOO FULL. SO PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I THINK IT'S RCOGNIZE PREVENTIVE CARE. YOU KNOW WHAT IS SETTLED EXPRESSION A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE IF WE CAN PROVIDE THIS KIND OF HEALTH CARE. AND WITH THAT WE HEAR NUMBERS OF HOW MANY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND BUT HOW MANY BILLIONS AND BILLIONS TO WIND UP SPENDING BY NOT PUTTING THAT MONEY IN UP FRONT. THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS WHO NEED CARE CORD TO WHO DESERVE THAT CARE THERE ARE FAMILY I REMEMBER WALKING INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND I LOOKED AT THESE PEOPLE REYES THESE AREN'T IMMIGRANTS THESE AREN'T FARMWORKERS THE SWORD UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE. THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS. AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT AND WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT WE DO SAVE MONEY WE DO SAVE LIVES AND WE ALSO SAVE THE HUMAN SPIRIT. BY HELPING THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM CENA NAINA SENATOR ALSO TO LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I A I GREATLY APPRECIATE. EVERYONE'S COMMENTS. YOUR HEARTFELT COMMENTS OF SENATOR FROM -- LA COUNTY. AND THE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND EVERYONE ELSE ANA IT'S BEEN TREMENDOUS TO SIT HERE I'M -- I FEEL VERY HUMBLED. BY. ALL OF YOU JUMP IN AND TO GIVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHY. COVERING. ANOTHER. HUNDRED FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF AND I WELCOME THE DEBATE THAT I'VE HAD WITH NUMBER OF PEOPLE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. I THANK OUR PRO TEM FOR BRINGING IN THE FACTS AND THE FIGURES AND ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD PROPERLY. EVALUATE AND JUDGE THE TO BE ABLE TO SAY WE ARE BOTH RESPONSIBLE AND WE LOOK AT OTHERS AS HUMAN BEINGS. ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE FOR A ROOKIE OF OF COMING INTO THIS A GREAT SENATE CHAMBERS IT'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARY SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. NOT ONLY FOR YOUR SUPPORT HERE WITH THIS BILL BUT FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO YOU ARE TREMENDOUS LEADERS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I'M BROKEN HEARTED. THAT THERE ARE STILL INDIVIDUALS. WHO REFER? TO HARD WORKING HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE JUST TRYING. TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN RAISE OUR FAMILIES NOT LIVE IN VIOLENCE. NOT LIVE IN. FEARING DEATH EVERY DAY IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THEY'RE NOT HERE TO INVADE THIS COUNTRY. THEY'RE HERE TO HELP THIS COUNTRY. BY WORKING HARD. AND NOTHING COULD BE SAID OF THEM ANY DIFFERENT THAN THEY COME HERE TO WORK HARD. THEY ARE NOT OUR ENEMIES. THEY ARE NOT LOOKING TO CAUSE HARM TO ANYONE. IN FACT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT UNDOCUMENTED OR ELIGIBLE FOR THE STAY AWAY FROM. A WEEK WE HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. HOW MANY OF THEM ARE GOING TO COME FORWARD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY STAY AWAY? THEY ARE STRONG HARD WORKING HUMAN BEINGS. AND I URGE. SOME OF YOU. JUST A HANDFUL I HOPE. OF WHO MADE SUCH OFFENSIVE OFFENSIVE REMARKS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THAT. GO BACK TO DISTRICT. AND REALLY PAY ATTENTION. TO WHO'S WORKING IN THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT YOU'RE DISTRICT RELIES ON AND THINK ABOUT IT TWICE AND I HOPE THAT IN YOUR HEART. YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT. THE KIND OF PEOPLE. THAT WE ARE.

SENATE BILL TWO TEN BY SENATOR LEYVA AN ACT RELATING TO VEHICULAR AIR POLLUTION SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD. MEMBERS I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND SO IF YOU'VE HEARD ME TELL THIS STORY -- WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES WE COULDN'T SEE THE MOUNTAINS THAT WERE VERY CLOSE TO WHERE I LIVE? IN CHINO AND GREW UP. AND THEN AS THE YEARS WENT ON THINGS GOT A LITTLE BIT BETTER. BUT IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES THERE WAS SO MUCH SMOG THAT WE COULDN'T SEE THE MOUNTAINS WHEN I WAS -- NEWMAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WE HAD SMOG DAYS OUR LUNGS HURT WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO OUTSIDE. AND THEN THINGS GOT A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND WE CAN SEE THE MOUNTAINS NOW WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY SMOG DAYS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED THE PARTICULATES GOTTEN SMALLER SO EVEN THOUGH WE SEE THE MOUNTAINS AND APPEARS TO BE A PRETTY DAY. THERE'S STILL A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SMOG NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT BUT UP AND DOWN THE STATE. SB TWO TEN ESTABLISHES A SMOG CHECK REQUIREMENT FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WILL APPLY SIMILAR RESPONSIBILITIES TO TRUCK OPERATORS TO MAINTAIN THEIR MISSION CONTROLS AS WE ALREADY REQUIRE THE CARS THAT WE ALL DRIVE TO DEAL. UNLIKE PERSONAL PASSENGER VEHICLES CURRENT LAWS DO NOT REQUIRE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS TO HAVE REGULAR SMALL CHECKS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR MISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING PROPERLY THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFESPAN. APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS DRIVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA ROADS ANNUALLY AND ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THE STATE'S POOR AIR QUALITY. STATEWIDE NEARLY TWELVE MILLION RESIDENTS LIVING COMMUNITIES THAT FAIL TO MEET FEDERAL CLEAN AIR STANDARDS. HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS OPERATING CALIFORNIA ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY NITROGEN KNOCKS. AND 82% OF DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER A POTENTIALLY CANCER CAUSING AIR CONTAMINANT. EXPOSURE TO THESE HARMFUL AIR CONTAMINANTS IS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CHRONIC HEART AND LUNG DISEASE OR DISEASES. AND OTHER SERIOUS IMPACTS FOR EARLY ADULT ELDERLY ADULTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. MEMBERS DIRTY AIR COST CALIFORNIA OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN HOSPITALIZATIONS VISITS TO EMERGENCY ROOMS AND CHRONIC ILLNESSES. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE MUCH WORSE IN REGIONS ACROSS THE STREET A STATE LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BETTER AFFECTED GREATLY BY WAREHOUSES IN CONGESTED FREEWAYS DESPITE THE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE A TO SUPPORT A TRANSITION TO ZERO AND NEAREST ZERO EMISSION. HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES DIESEL TRUCKS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE ON OUR ROADS FOR DECADES TO COME. WE HAVE TO TAKE A BOLD STEP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR MISSION CONTROL THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFESPAN. THIS ACTION ALONE WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. OVER THE NEXT TEST DECADE SB TWO TEN WILL ASSIST IN THE REMOVAL OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED TONS OF HARMFUL PARTICULAR MATTER. EQUIVALENT TO TAKING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TRUCKS OFF THE ROAD. NOT ONLY WILL SB TWO TEN HELP IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND AIR QUALITY IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AS BIG THEY BECOME MORE FREQUENTLY MAINTAIN. SB TWO TEN ALSO APPLIES TO OUT OF STATE TRUCKS AND WILL HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR ARE LAW ABIDING CALIFORNIA TRUCK OWNERS AND OPERATORS. SIMPLY PUT SB TWO TEN WILL BE A WIN WIN FOR CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIES AND FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASOCIATION THE CAT AND THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE EVERY SHARED IMPORTANCE AS THEY TOO WANT THE STATE TO FAIRLY ENFORCE VEHICLE STANDARDS AND A MISSION LAWS FOR IN COMPLIANCE MAINLY OUT OF STATE TRACKS. WELL SOME INDUSTRY CONCERNS REMAIN WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER ALONG WITH CLEAN AIR ADVOCATES TO RESOLVE THEM. I AM THROUGH THE AZTEC THAT OPPOSITION BELIEVES THAT THE APPROPRIATIONS AMENDMENTS BELIEVE THAT THEY IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. RECENT AMENDMENTS INSURE THAT A. R. B. WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE OUR BUDGET COMMITTEES AND OPEN FOR PUBLIC SCRUTINY FOR THE FEES AND PROGRAM RULES THAT THEY PROPOSE. ADDITIONALLY THE FEES CANNOT BE USED FOR OTHER PROGRAMS ARE BE ASSESSED ABOVE THE DETAILED AND REVIEWED COST OF THE PROGRAM. THE FEW WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO BE ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR SMALL AND LARGE TRUCK OPERATORS. SB TWO TENNIS SUPPORTED BY DOZENS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SHANE IN HEARING ON SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN [inaudible] HI ARCHULETA [inaudible] HI. I'M SORRY I MISSED SENATOR PORCHES HOUSES MIKE PLEASE. WAS THERE OUGHT TO VOTE SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESERVATION OF QUESTIONS THE AUTHOR. SOONER LEGAL YOU TAKE QUESTION HAPPY TO SERVE. GREATER. I WANT TO DO -- JUST ASK QUESTION ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MEDIUM AND LARGE TRUCKS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY GO THROUGH IN ANNUAL -- OR EVERY FEW YEAR -- PROCESS FOR EMISSIONS COMPLIANCE. IS THAT NOT SUFFICIENT. IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT -- IT IS A TEST THE IT IT'S A RANDOMLY SELECTED TRUCKS -- GOING UP AND DOWN THE ROADS AND THEY DO SOMETHING CALLED AN OPACITY TEST THAT JUST LOOKS AT THE SMOKE THAT THEY ARE ADMITTING BUT THERE'S ALSO THE NO MECHANISM IF THE TRUCK IS POLLUTING THERE'S NO MECHANISM. TO MAKE SURE THE TRUCK NO LONGER -- IT POLLUTES SO IT'S RANDOM SB TWO TEN WOULD MAKE SURE THAT ALL TRUCKS COMPLY WITH THE SAME -- PROCEDURES DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON WHAT THIS WOULD DO TO CERTAIN INDUSTRIES -- TRUCKING CATTLE AG SO AND SO FORTH. IF -- TRUCKS ARE DEEMED TO BE IN THE HIGHER POLLUTING CATEGORY. BY IS THERE A REPLACEMENT MECHANISM THAT -- WILL HAVE WOULD. OFFER SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY YOU MEAN THE IF THEY'RE TRUCKERS POLLUTING A LOT WITH BABY HAVE ACCESS TO BY PURCHASING A CLEANER VEHICLE. EITHER THAT OR SMALLER ENTITIES PURCHASING THOSE. LARGER -- TRUCKS -- BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE HELD TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROGRAMS OUT THERE WHERE YOU CAN -- YOU CAN APPLY FOR A GRANT TO GET CLEANER ENERGY TRUCKS THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THE TRUCKS THAT ARE ON THE ROAD TODAY HOUSE A SMOG CHECK JUST LIKE WE DO WITH ALL OF OUR PERSONAL VEHICLES. AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT IN MEETING MORE THAN THEY'RE SUPPOSED. TO OR IN JUST TO BE CLEAR I I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT EMISSIONS WHEN IT COMES TO DIESEL AND AND REGULAR -- THESE EMISSIONS ARE THESE ARE TRANSPORTATION THESE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD OF EMISSIONS AS OPPOSED TO NON COMMERCIAL. ANY OF THAT I'M AWARE OF IS IT THE SAME. NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE HELD TO ANY DIFFERENT STANDARD OF THEY DO POLLUTE MORE THAN YOUR REGULAR AVERAGE VEHICLE DOES AS YOU HEARD ME SAY IN MY MY STATEMENT. SIXTEEN HUNDRED TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE COULD BE SAVED FROM THAT AND THIS BILL WHILE HAVING THESE TRUCKS -- GET A SMOG CHECK OVER TEN YEARS WILL BE LIKE TAKING THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TRUCKS OFF THE ROAD WITHOUT ACTUALLY TAKE HIM OFF THE ROAD THE OLDEST BE RUNNING CLEANER. SO IN TERMS OF MY BACKYARD -- REPRESENTING AN AREA IN THE VALLEY WE'VE GOT. THE WORST AIR. HANDS DOWN SO THERE IS A BALANCE AND I AM NOT CERTAIN EXACTLY WHERE IT IS. BUT WE ALSO HAVE MAJOR INDUSTRY -- IT NEEDS DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE ON I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S BEEN ANY RESEARCH ON HOW THIS WILL ACTUALLY IMPACT -- THE AG INDUSTRY THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY -- CATTLE INDUSTRY SO ON AND SO FORTH SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CATTLEMEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FARM BUREAU AND I THINK THEY BROUGHT ALL THEIR CONSIDER CONCERNS FORWARD. AND WE'VE BEEN WE'VE DONE A LOT OF GREAT WORK WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM. THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- AND THEY'VE BEEN TERRIFIC TO WORK WITH AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION SO WE HAVE NOT CLEARED ALL OF THEIR CONCERNS BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE AND THEY'VE BEEN TERRIFIC TO WORK WITH [inaudible] THANK YOU.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE. READ SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN BUT CENTERRUBIO AND ACTUALLY ANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU. MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I AM. I RISE TO PRESENT SB SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN TO INCREASE FULL TIME FACULTY AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND NINETEEN EIGHTY COLLEGE THIS MISSION. AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND ALSO ESTABLISHED A GOAL THAT 75% OF INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE TAUGHT BY A FULL TIME FACULTY. IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AND THE 75% GOAL HAS YET TO BE ACHIEVED. MEMBERS AGAIN THIRTY YEARS AND WE'RE STILL NOT THERE. IN FACT DUE TO AN OVER RELIANCE ON PART TIME FACULTY THE RATE OF FULL TIME FACULTY HAS DROPPED TO FIFTY SIX POINT 7%. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM ADOPTED A VISION FOR SUCCESS. THIS IS THE SYSTEM PLAN TO HELP MORE STUDENTS RECEIVED DEGREES TRANSFER TO FOUR YEAR COLLEGES CLOSE EQUITY GAPS AMONG STUDENT GROUPS AND CLOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AMONG THE REGION I BRING MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO YOU AND I KNOW PERSONALLY AFTER BEING AN EDUCATOR FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS THAT OUR STUDENTS DO BETTER WITH TEACHERS ARE VESTED. AND THEY CAN BUILD A LONG LASTING RELATIONSHIP. I STILL MENTOR FOURTH GRADE STUDENTS WHO ARE ADULTS AND NOT BECAUSE I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ON CAMPUS SEE THEM OFTEN. AND BE PRESENT WHEN THEY NEEDED MY HELP. FULL TIME FACULTY ARE ABLE TO STAY ON CAMPUS ALSO OFFICE HOURS ARE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS NEEDING HELP CONTRIBUTE MORE HOURS TO THE PROGRAMS ON CAMPUS WHICH IS. REALLY IMPORTANT AND SPEND MORE TIME AS COUNSELORS AND MENTORS AMONG OTHER BENEFITS THIS BILL IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LARGEST STUDENT POPULATION AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IS ALSO THE POPULATION THAT'S MOST IN NEED. BECAUSE THE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF THE STATE'S RESTED LARGE PART ON EDUCATIONAL SUCCESSES OF THE GROWING NUMBER OF MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND BECAUSE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE INTEGRAL TO ALL THOSE MINORITY COMMUNITIES IT IS IMPERATIVE WE DO ALL WE COUNTY INCREASE STUDENT ACADEMIC OUTCOMES I COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND INCREASING THE RATE OF INSTRUCTION BY FULL TIME FACULTY IS CRITICAL TO REACHING THIS GOAL AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

AND WE'RE RETURNING TO FILE ITEM NINE SENATOR JACKSON ARE YOU PREPARED. MANA MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL FIVE FIFTY ONE BY SENATOR JACKSON AN ACT RELATING TO OIL AND GAS. INTERJECTION THANK YOU MISS PRESSING COLLEAGUES THIS IS A MEASURE THAT SIMPLY DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES. BELOVED LEE KNOWN AS DARKER. TO DEVELOP AN ACCOUNTING MECHANISM. FOR ASSESSING THE COST OF DECOMMISSIONING AND REMEDIATING WORRELL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE. THAT IS ALL THE BILL DOES. THE COST OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE STATE IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. FOR EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT TRUST IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER FUNDS FOR TRUST -- FACILITIES THAT HAVE ARE BEING DECOMMISSIONED. AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR A SERIES OF ABANDONED COSTA WELLS. AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE WELLS OFF. AND ONSHORE WELLS FACILITY STORAGE TANKS AND PRODUCTION LINES. WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS. ON IDENTIFYING THESE WELLS IN DOING THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTING FOR A SMALL. PERCENTAGE OF THESE WELLS. MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES HAS DONE LEGISLATION DEALING WITH OFFSHORE WELLS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THEM AND TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COSTS WILL BE IF WE IF AND WHEN THEY ARE DECOMMISSIONED. AS WELL AS FORMER SENATOR LARA. WE ARE WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT IDLE DWELLS AND OFFSHORE WELLS. BUT THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND OPERATING WELLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MOST OF WHICH ARE NOT COVERED THIS MECHANISM. UNDER THIS BILL WILL DIRECT DARKER TO DEVELOP A TRULY COMPREHENSIVE TOOL. TO ASSESS ALL INFRASTRUCTURE WE DO THIS NOW FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE SURFACE MINING INDUSTRY. AND IT IS EMINENTLY SENSIBLE THAT WE DO THE SAME WITH THE SECTOR WITH A FOOTPRINT IN LITERALLY EVERY CORNEROF THE STATE. RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN APPROPRIATIONS FURTHER CLARIFY DOGGER MAY DEVELOP A STANDARD MODEL SO THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE INDIVIDUAL. INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENTS FOR EACH CATEGORY OF INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE DOCTOR CAN MAKE ITS BEST ESTIMATES AS TO THE LIFETIME OF CURRENTLY PRODUCING INFRASTRUCTURE. I WANT THIS MCHANISM TO BE BOTH USEFUL FOR THE PUBLIC AND WORKABLE FOR THE AGENCY WITH THIS BILL. THIS IS A BILL OF TRANSPARENCY SO THAT WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FULL SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM AND TO PLAN FOR LIABILITIES IN AN UP FRONT. AN ORDERLY WAY. THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT IS A REAL PROBLEM AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG ON THIS ITEM [inaudible] HOLD. THANK YOU UP. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT YOU KNOW. A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SPEAKER PEREZ. OF THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR SIGNED A LAW. CALLED RIGS TO REEFS. THE BASIC PREMISE BEHIND THE LAW. WAS THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OFFSHORE WELLS. AND THAT IF INSTEAD OF SOME OF THOSE WELLS AS TALL AS A THOUSAND FEET GOING DOWN TO THE DEPTHS OF THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN. AND INSTEAD OF ARM HAVING THOSE WELLS JUST BE REMOVED AS THE REQUIRED UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW. IF THERE'S A NET ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. THE NOTION WAS YOU CAN CHOP IT OFF AT A HUNDRED FEATURES ALL SHIPS CAN GO OVER IT. IT WOULD BE A RE FENCE RIGS TO REEFS. AND IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN THAT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. THERE WAS SOME CHALLENGES WITH THAT AND FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS ON THIS FLOOR I HAVE BEEN ARGUING. FOR THIS IDEA OF THE RIGS TO REEFS BECAUSE THE NOTION WAS THAT THE MONEY SAVED. 80% 85% OF THE MONEY BEING SAVED WOULD GO INTO AND IN DOWN ONE FOR THE OCEAN. IT WOULD MAKE WE ESTIMATE. OF FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ENDOWMENT PROTECT THE OCEAN. THE SINGLE LARGEST ENDOWMENT ON PLANET EARTH TO PROTECT THE OCEAN. IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US AS WE FACE CHALLENGES IN THIS BODY TO PAY. FOR OTHER THINGS EDUCATION HEALTHCARE AND OTHER CHALLENGES TO ALSO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE OCEAN THE WAY THIS WOULD DO SO. TO THE BILL THAT I HAD HAD TO MAKE IT IN THAT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT IT HAS BEEN QUITE CHALLENGING. THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT REQUIRES STARTED NOW DO AN ASSESSMENT. AS TO WHAT IT WOULD COST TO REMOVE EACH OF THESE AS NOW IN ADDITION TO DOES OTHER PIPELINES AND OTHER THINGS BUT I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED THE OFFSHORE. OIL WELLS SO NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT A REAL ASSESSMENT AS TO HOW MUCH MONEY COULD BE SAVED. TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO THIS IMPORTANT AND DOWN ONE FOR THE OCEAN. AGAINST THE ARM THE THE THE ANY OTHERS ASSOCIATED COSTS AT INFO OF FOR OF COURSE ONLY IF THERE'S AN THAT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT SO FOR THAT REASON I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TODAY. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE SO WE CAN QUANTIFY THE SAVINGS IN THE BENEFIT TO THE OCEAN. OF CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND AS FOR AND I THINK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OF IT ON THE SIDE OF IN CHINO ANSWER JACKSON JAW TO CLOSE THANK YOU WELL I ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE WISDOM OF MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WE DO HAPPEN TO DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT. ON THAT. THE REACH TO REAP CONCEPT BUT THE ISSUE IS THE SAME WE NEED TO DO AN ASSESSMENT WENEED TO KNOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT THE COST IS GOING TO BE WHEN AND IF WE START DE COMMISSIONING THE VARIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS THIS IS TRUST THE BILL SO THAT WE KNOW? IT IS A TRANSPARENCY BILL. THAT'S ALL IT DOES BECAUSE TODAY IRONICALLY WE HAVE NO IDEA. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ON A VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN [inaudible] I ARCHULETA.

FOURTEEN SENATOR SKINNER YOU PREPARED FOR THIS ITEM. SHE IS MOVING BACK TO HER DESK. IN THE MEAN TIME INSTRUCTOR PLEASE RATE SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO HOUSING. WINNERS CAM THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS SO SB THREE THIRTY IS A RARE BILL THAT HAS BOTH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION AND CAL CHAMBER IN SUPPORT. NOW WHAT IS SB THREE THIRTY DO. I IT THIS BILL. WAS PATTERNED AFTER. THE ACTIONS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN WHEN THEY EXPERIENCED A LARGE LOSS OF HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE AFTER FIRE OR ANOTHER DISASTER. IN THEIR OBJECTIVE WAS TO GET THAT HOUSING REPLACED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO I SERVED ON THE BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL DURING THE OAKLAND. BERKELEY TUNNEL FIRE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN WE LOST OVER THREE THOUSAND UNITS IN A TWELVE HOUR PERIOD SO UP UNTIL THE SANTA ROSA FIRE THAT WAS THE WORST DISASTER IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY THE LARGEST LOSS OF UNITS THE LARGEST LOSS OF LIFE. OF COURSE IN ROSE'S SICK EXCEEDED THAT -- BUT INDEPENDENT OF THAT BOTH SANTAROSA AND OAKLAND BERKELEY AFTER THAT LOSS OF UNITS. KNOWING THAT THEY WANTED TO GET HOUSING FAST. THE STREAMLINED THE PROCESS A BIT THEY DID WHAT THEY WERE ALREADY DOING BUT THEY DID IT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY TO HELP GET THAT HOUSING BACK IMMEDIATELY. SO THAT'S WHAT SB THREE THIRTY IS PATTERNED AFTER AND IN FACT I ASKED BEFORE A SUBMITTED THE BILL THE CONCEPT ALLEGE COUNCIL I ASKED THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA FOR WHAT THEY DID WHAT THEY ENACTED. IN ORDER TO ASSIST IN THEIR UNITS AND THIS BILL IS VERY MUCH PATTERNED AFTER THAT. SO IT RELIES ON OUR EXISTING LOCAL ZONING AND IT TELLS OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO WHAT YOU ARE DOING. BUT DO IT EFFECTIVELY DO IT EFFICIENTLY AND DON'T CHANGE THE RULES MIDSTREAM SO ONCE A HOUSING APPLICANT HAS SUBMITTED THEIR APPLICATION THAT FOLLOWS THE ZONING RULES AND FOLLOWS THE EXISTING DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS. AND ONCE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT SAYS YOUR APPLICATION IS COMPLETE THEN THE BILL SAYS PROCESS THE PERMIT ANY YEAR. AND IT LIMITS THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC HEARINGS BUT TO TO UP TO SIX IT STILL ALLOWS FOR UP TO SIX PUBLIC HEARINGS AND IT SAYS GET THAT PERMIT OUT. IN ONE YEAR AND THEN DURING THAT YEAR DO NOT CHANGE THE RULES DON'T CHANGE THE SIGN REVIEW DON'T CHANGE OTHER RULES THAT WAY THE APPLICANT KNOWS THERE'S CONSISTENCY. THIS HELPS REDUCE THE COST OF HOUSING BECAUSE TIME IS MONEY. SO WHAT SB THREE THIRTY DOES IT TAKE KNOWLEDGE THAT UP AND DOWN THE STATE WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE NEED UNITS FAST WE NEED AFFORDABLE UNITS AND WE NEED MARKET RE UNITS AND WE NEED THEM FAST -- IT ALSO THE BILL IS EFFECTIVE FOR FIVE YEARS SO IT SUNSETS IN FIVE YEARS IT ALSO SUSPENDS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO DOWN ZONE OR PUT A CAP ON THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS JUST FOR THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND FIVE THERE WAS ORIGINALLY IN THE BILL A CAP ON FEES BUT THAT IS BEEN LIFTED SO THAT IS NO LONGER IN THE BILL. AND IT'S EFFECTIVE FOR FIVE YEARS AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

NOW WE'RE MOVING TO FILE ITEM SIXTEEN SENATOR MITCHELL. ARE YOU PREPARED FOR SUPPLY LINE. SIXTEEN MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE THREE SENATE BILL ONE FORTY FOUR BY SENATOR MITCHELL AN ACT RELATING TO FEES [inaudible] MR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT [inaudible] I DON'T [inaudible] I MEAN [inaudible] OKAY. I'M SORRY I GOT A LOT OF PAPER HERE TO TRY TO MANAGE TAKES TIME. SENATE BILL ONE FORTY FOUR COLLEAGUES CURRENT LAW STATES. THAT COUNTIES ALLOWS COUNTIES TO CHARGE FEES FOR DOZENS OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND JUSTICE SYSTEM ALLOWS THEM TO SET THE AMOUNT OF FEES. THIS LAW HAS RESULTED IN A PATCHWORK OF FEES CHARGED THROUGHOUT THE STATE WAS VERY ON EVEN OUTCOMES IN EACH COUNTY. SENATE BILL ONE FORTY FOUR SIX TO REFORM THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BY ENDING THE FAILED PUBLIC POLICY FOR A BILLION PEOPLE. ACCUSED AND CONVICTED OF CRIMES FOR THE COST OF THESE SERVICES. EVEN AFTER THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME AND EVEN THOUGH ALL OF US ARE SUPPOSEDLY A BURKE PURPORTEDLY BENEFICIARIES OF THESE SYSTEMS. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE FINE ONLY FEES. HOWEVER LAWS ON THE BOOKS AND STAKEHOLDERS OFTEN USE TO TAME THE TERMS INTERCHANGEABLY. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SANCTIONS ARE OFTEN BLURRED FOR THOSE RECEIVING BILLS AS THEY ARE CALCULATED ARTICULATED AS ONE LARGE AMOUNT OFTEN WITHOUT ANY DISTINCTION. WHILE THE BILL WAS UP ON THE SUSPENSE FILE WE SURVEY FAMILY STATE WHY. THE IDENTIFIED THE MOST EGREGIOUS OF THE FEES ANY FEE THAT DID NOT MAKE THIS WORST OF THE WORST LIST WERE ADOPTED AS OFFICE AMENDMENTS. THE COMMITTEE STRUCK A HOST OF ADDITIONAL FEES. THE RESULT IS THE AMENDED BILL BEFORE YOU THAT RETURN TO MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEES TO THE COURTS AND COUNTIES. ADMINISTRATIVE FEES POLL STREAMING PROBLEMS FOR CITIES COUNTIES IN RESIDENTS NUMBER ONE THEY ARE CHARGED TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEM. TO THEY CREATE BARRIERS TO RE ENTRY AND THREE THEY ARE SELF DEFEATING ANEMIC SOURCE OF REVENUE. THE CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM AS CONDUCTED BY THE COURTS IN COUNTIES WAS NOT DESIGNED TO RELYING FEES HOWEVER OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL DECADES A SERIES OF EVENTS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED FEES. AND THEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN COLLECTIBLE FEES. THE REGRESSIVE TOUGH ON CRIME AIR OF THE NIGHT EIGHTIES AND NINETIES LEANED HEAVILY ON FEES IS PUNITIVE DESPITE THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT AS FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE SYSTEM. WITH THE GREAT RECESSION CAME SIGNIFICANT CUT STATE WHY CUTS THAT WE AS A STATE ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM THIS THIS INCREASE THE RELIANCE FOR FEES AS A REVENUE SOURCE. WITH THE REALIGNMENT RECENT COURT DECISIONS AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE ONCE INTRACTABLE PROBLEM RECIDIVISM THE SYSTEM NOW FINDS ITSELF WITH A STEADILY DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS BODY HURT SB ONE NINETY AND VOTED TO ELIMINATE JUVENILE FEES. IN THE LESS THAN TWO YEARS SINCE IMPLEMENTATION THE COUNTIES ARE AT 1100% COMPLIANCE WITH THAT LAW. IN FACT SOME COUNTIES WENT BEYOND THE LAW AND THE FOR GIVEN BACK -- TO FEES NOTABLY THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE LOS ANGELES. IN A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY ON THE IMPACT THEIR PROBATION FEES IN CALIFORNIA. FIFTY EIGHT PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS WERE SENT TO ALL COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. 80% OF COUNTIES RESPONDED REPRESENTING NEARLY POPULATION. RESPONSES SHOW THAT MOST COUNTIES DO NOT TRACK COLLECTION RATES SUGGESTING THAT THE FEES ARE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE THE COUNTY BUDGETS. THOSE THAT DID TRACK COLLECTION RATES REVEAL LOW COLLECTION RATES AND THE HIGH COST OF COLLECTION. ALSO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO BY WAY OF THEIR FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT PUBLISHED. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES HI PAIN FOR PEOPLE LOW GAIN FOR GOVERNMENT A CALL TO ACTION FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. AS A RESULT OF THAT PUBLISHED REPORT SAN FRANCISCO ABOLISHED ALL LOCALLY IMPOSE FEES AND FULLY DISCHARGED ALL LOCALLY IMPOSE CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE DEBT. IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR THE US SUPREME COURT RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THE PROHIBITION IN THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION RELATING TO EXCESSIVE FINES DOES IN FACT APPLY TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THEREBY LIMITING THEIR ABILITIES TO IMPOSE FINES AND SEIZE PROPERTY. PERMISSION TO READ MISTER PRESIDENT. WHAT I'LL DO CAPTION JUNCTION THANK YOU IN THAT RULING JUSTICE GINSBURG SAYS AND I QUOTE FOR GOOD REASON THE PROTECTION AGAINST EXCESSIVE FINES HAS BEEN A CONSTANT SHIELD? THROUGHOUT ANGLE AMERICAN HISTORY EXORBITANT TOLLS UNDERMINE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES. AND THAT THE PROTECTION AGAINST EXCESSIVE PUNITIVE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS SECURED BY THE CLAUSE IS BOTH FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR SCHEME OF ORDERED LIBERTY AND DEEPLY ROOTED IN THIS NATION'S HISTORY AND TRADITION. IN QUOTE. THIS FEBRUARY ALONG WITH A SEVERAL OF YOU I ATTENDED THE SMART JUSTICE CALIFORNIA RETREAT. SOME OF YOU IN THIS ROOM WERE THERE AS WELL THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAY WAS THAT VICTIMS. WHO WERE PRESENT? TALKED ABOUT THEIR PREFERENCE FOR JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT FOCUSES MORE ON REHABILITATION THAN PUNISHMENT. EDUCATION THAN INCARCERATION AND JOB CREATION AND TREATMENT. THEY TALKED ABOUT COMING TO THAT CONCLUSION BASED ON THEIR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT REALLY HELPS RECIDIVISM RATES. LAST MONTH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AGREED TO EXAMINE THE APPLICATION OF FINES FEES AND PENALTIES AND DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ELIMINATING SOME OR ALL OF THEM. I WALK THROUGH THIS RATHER LENGTHY SUMMARY BECAUSE I REALLY HOPE TO MAKE CLEAR TO YOU THAT SB ONE FORTY FOUR IS PROMOTING THE NEW VISION FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. AND WE'RE NOT AHEAD OF THE CURVE COMMUNITIES COURTS COUNTY IS AN EVIDENCE BASED STUDIES MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. THAT THE FEES ARE AGAIN HIGH PAYING LOW GAME THEY PERPETUATE RECIDIVISM ARE A CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE. MANY OF YOU I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH WHO EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN YOU'VE HEARD FROM YOUR COUNTIES WHO WILL GIVE YOU A DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT THEY SAY THIS BILL WILL BLOW A HOLE IN THEIR BUDGET -- I'VE. STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO GO BACK TO TALK YOUR COUNTIES TO ACTUALLY ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT COLLECTION RATE. AND WHAT FEE THEY ARE PAID OR WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ACTUALLY TRYING TO COLLECT THESE FEES. WE'VE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS -- ABOUT SOME OF THE PARTICULARS IN THE BILL SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES IN OTHERS. AND MY POINT TO YOU IS REALLY TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THIS PROCESS WITH THE BILL. THE PRIMARY LETTER OF OFFER OPPOSITION STATE. FROM THE COUNTIES AND AND THOSE IN OPPOSITION THAT THEY DON'T CHALLENGED THE POLICY THAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS WITH THE BILL. THE QUESTION IS LOS REVENUE. THE QUESTION I POSED TO THE OPPOSITION THAT I HOPE THAT YOU ALL WILL DO AS WELL IS LET'S GET A REAL CLEAR PICTURE OF THE TRUE DOLLARS IN SINCE. BEING DEBATED [inaudible] WHAT? KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE THEY IN CURRY IN THEIR EFFORT TO COLLECT THE FEES. AND WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLY COLLECTING NOT WHAT'S OLD TO THEM ON THE BOOKS BUT WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLY COLLECTING. WE'RE NOT ABLE TO COLLECT THAT DATA ACROSS THE BOARD AND UNTIL WE DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD AND HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO CONTINUE TO CHARGE PEOPLE. BOB SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THE SYSTEM SOME OF WHOM AVE BEEN -- HAVE ALREADY PAID THEIR IF YOU WILL FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER TERM DEBT TO SOCIETY. AND IF IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE CONTINUE TO ON THE BACKS OF PEOPLE IMPACTED BY THESE SYSTEMS. CHARGE THEM FOR WHAT ARE IN EFFECT GOVERNMENT SERVICES. FOLKS OF ASK ME THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT ABOUT NOT YOU KNOW. CHARGING KNOWS BASED ON THEIR INABILITY TO PAY. WELL THAT'S ALREADY IN THE LAW AND APPARENTLY DOESN'T GET IMPLEMENTED. FOR MORE COALITION THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT A TASK FORCE MEETING. ONE TOWNS COALITION MEMBER ASK A PROBATION CHIEF IF THEY ALREADY DID THAT. AND THE PROBATION CHIEF ADMITTED THAT THEY REALLY DON'T DO THE ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION IN THEIR COUNTY. THEY JUST CHARGE EVERYONE AND ATTEMPT TO LET THEIR COLLECTION AGENCY DEAL WITH COLLECTIONS. BECAUSE THE COLLECTION RATE IS SO LOW THE AMOUNT THE COUNTY SPENDS AND COLLECTING THESE FEES IS THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART. OF WHAT'S COLLECTED TRULY IMPLEMENTING ABILITY TO PAY WOULD JUST INCREASE THE ADMIN COSTS AND SINCE WE KNOW MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY WOULD BE SPENDING MORE PUBLIC DOLLARS -- TO ATTEMPT TO FIND A NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK A RARE DEFENDED WHO HAS A RESOURCES SO IT SIMPLY IS NOT COST EFFECTIVE WE BELIEVE FOR MOST COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AND GOVERNMENTS. OUT WITH THAT MISTER PRESIDENT I'D ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB. ONE FORTY FOUR THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MUCH IS THE PRESIDENT SO. I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AND I START WITH THE BASIS OF WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE LOST OUR WAY. WHEN YOU STUDY THE REASONS FOR PUNISHMENT WHEN PEOPLE VIOLATE THE LAW? WHETHER IT IS TAKING AWAY THEIR LIBERTY OR IMPOSING A FINE. THE PURPOSE OF THE FINE. IS TO PUNISH FOR DEFENSE. THAT'S ITS PURPOSE. THAT'S WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. BUT WE HAVE LOST OUR WAY. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. IT COSTS THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS UNDER OUR CODE IF YOU BOUGHT A STOP SIGN. THAT'S WHAT IT COSTS THAT'S THE SIZE OF THE FINE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS WE HAVE USED THESE PROCESSES TO BASICALLY SUPPLEMENT AND FUND ALL SORTS OF GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS THERE'S A PENALTY ASSESSMENT ON TOP OF THAT THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS. FOR FORTY DOLLARS THERE'S A COUNTY ASSESSMENT OF TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS A PROP SIXTY NINE DNA ASSESSMENT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET A STOP SIGN WHAT THAT MEANS FOR DNA FOR TWENTY DOLLARS. THERE'S AN EMT CHARGE FOR FOUR DOLLARS ANOTHER SURPLUS ANOTHER OF V. FOR FOR OTHER THINGS IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS. TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS. THE TEST IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE PUNISHING PEOPLE BUT TO BE LAZY AND TO USE THESE SYSTEMS TO COLLECT FEES FOR ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS LEADERS TO FEW OF THE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF EXAMPLES. IT'S ABOUT PUNISHMENT. WHAT IS THE PRICE OF JUSTICE? WE HEARD FROM THE OF THE AUTHOR ON THIS THAT THE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE IMPOSING ALL THESE BILLS NOT COLLECTING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S TO THE STORY. THE REPORT A 200-013-1411 BILLION DOLLARS OF UNPAID. FINES. SO LET'S SEE YOUR IMPOSING THESE FINES YOU'RE NOT COLLECTING ANYTHING AND YOU'RE RUINING PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WE HEARD ABOUT. THE SYSTEM DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE IT'S GONE AMOK WE HAVE LOST OUR WAY. THE DOING USE CASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M GONNA QUOTE THAT. THE DECISION OF THE COURT WHERE THEY SAID. IMPOSING UNPAYABLE FINES AND FEES ON INJURED INDIGENT. DEFENDANTS IS NOT ONLY UNFAIR IT SERVES NO RATIONAL PURPOSE. FAILS TO FURTHER THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND MAY BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND I WOULD SUGGEST IT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. I UNDERSTAND THAT GOVERNMENT NEEDS MONEY FOR OTHER THINGS BUT YOU DON'T TAKE IT OFF THE BACKS OF PEOPLE WE HEARD OTHER DEBATES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ON THE FLOOR OF THIS HOUSE. OF THE ISSUES THAT IMPACTS WHEN OUR ON FOLKS LIVES WE KNOW THAT MOST FOLKS CAN'T EVEN COME UP BEFORE DOLLARS THAT HAVING TO BORROW FROM A FRIEND OR SELL SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL SO MUCH AND WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT IS IT REFOCUSES ON US AND BE ABLE TO ASK THE APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS BUT NOT TO PUT THE BURDEN ON THE BACKS. OF EVERYBODY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU -- PRESIDENT -- CENTERS -- ACTUALLY AT I ADMIT I'M STRUGGLING A BIT WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE ACTUALLY I AGREE WITH THE POLICY AND I AM I THINK -- MY GOOD FRIEND FROM AUSTIN JUST RING THIS BILL FORD ACTUALLY BOTH GOOD FRIENDS OF LOS ANGELES. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WHY I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS IS THAT IN MY OWN COUNTY HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. I KNOW THAT -- THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO ACTUALLY CARRY OUT A PROGRAM THROUGH A PROBATION DEPARTMENT TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. SAID OF HIS OWN TO ACTUALLY HELP. PEOPLE COLOR WHO -- WHO WERE INVOLVED IN FROM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM GET BACK ON THEIR FEET THEY DON'T RETURN TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- CERTAINLY A GOAL THAT I THINK WE ALL SHARE -- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE IDEA THAT PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO TRY TO FIND OTHER WAYS FOR THE FUNDS FUND IT BUT I'VE ALSO FACED WITH -- THE PEOPLE WITING THE PROGRAM TURNING TO ME AND SAYING WELL. YOU KNOW WITH THE OF WE DON'T HAVE THAT THAT IF WE LOSE THIS MONEY -- WE MAY HAVE TO YOU SEE SIGNIFICANT BACK OR EVEN CLOSE THE PROGRAM BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ASSURED THAT. NO IT WOULD NOT CONFIDENT THAT FUNDS WILL COME FROM OTHER PLACES -- SO I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. YOU'RE RIGHT YOU KNOW WE I THINK TECHNO COUNTY THEY HAVE IN FOR ME -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN DAY THEY SAYS FOURTEEN MILLION IN ADMINISTRATIVE FEES DALY COLLECTED FOUR POINT THREE MILLION. THEY DID REPORT. THEN THAT THEY SPENT FOUR TO TWENTY THOUSAND COLLECTIONS SO THEY DO COLLECT MORE THAN THEY THAN THEY CLAIM THEY SPENT ON COLLECTIONS I DIDN'T GO AND DO AN ACTION YOU KNOW DO AND A AUDIT OR SOMETHING TO FIND OUT HOW ACCURATE THAT IS. BUT I GUESS A QUESTION TO THE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR -- IF SHE'S WILLING TO TAKE IT SENATOR MITCHELL YOU TO QUESTION OF COURSE. I GUESS -- DO YOU HELP ME WITH ONE AND SAYS TO TELL MY WHO'S PROGRAM I WANT TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU WELL I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR PROBATION CHIEF THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT A PROBATION DEPARTMENT AS OPPOSED WAS DESIGNED. TO IN CREATED TO PROVIDE QUITE FRANKLY THAT THAT'S THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK. I WOULD SAY THAT SECONDLY -- DOCTOR ACIDITY PAN EASY YOUR COUNTY MAY BE YOU KNOW ONE OF FIFTY EIGHT ON THAT COULD ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THAT DATA BECAUSE A PART OF US RUNNING THIS BILL IN A PART OF MY DESIRE. TO HAVE THE BILL PASSED OUT OF THE FLOOR TODAY AND MOVE OVER TO THE OTHER HOUSE IS TO ALLOW WAS QUITE FRIENDLY TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN QUITE FRANKLY PUT PRESSURE. ON COUNTIES AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO COME FORWARD TO BE FORTHCOMING WITH THEIR RATE OF COLLECTION -- THEIR THEIR ADMIN FEE THAT THEY CHARGE TO COLLECT THOSE DOLLARS A MINUTE YOU ARE HEARING -- DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT THEY SAY THAT THEY'VE ASSESS LIKE YOU SAID FOURTEEN MILLION THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO THEY COLLECT. AND WHAT DOES IT COST THEM TO COLLECT THAT -- AGAIN I THINK MY MY CO AUTHOR -- ARTICULATED QUITE FAIRLY. IS THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF FEES. WE'RE CLEAR THAT FEES -- QUITE FRANKLY CAME INTO BEING A DURING% THE TIME WHEN PUBLIC FUNDING FOR THESE CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES WERE CUT AND WERE REDUCED. AND SO AS MANY IN THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP WHO ARE WORKING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT TIME SPENT. IS IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE SAME POPULATION GETS CHARGED. FOR THE WITHTHE ANTI RECIDIVISM SERVICES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BENEFIT THE I THINK THAT'S A TOUGH PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE THAT WE ALL HAVE TO CONFRONT. AGAIN ACROSS THE BOARD STATE WIDE WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH OF THOSE COLLECTED FEES ACTUALLY GO TO THE PROGRAMS THAT THE COURT CITIES AND COUNTIES VALUE AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS FOR YOUR SUPPORT IT PRIORITIZE AND FUNDING. I WOULD ARGUE WE HAVE SEEN -- IN SOME COUNTIES WHERE THE IT SHOULD BE PERSONNEL COSTS NOT JUST PERSONNEL COSTS FOR THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS THE PERSONNEL CAUGHT COSTS. ACROSS THE BOARD. AND AGAIN WE'RE CONTINUING TO ASK THE QUESTION. IF THE FEES ARE COLLECTED ARE THEY TRULY BEING USED THE WAY IN WHICH THAT WOULD BENEFIT THOSE WHO HAVE. EXPERIENCE TIME SPENT -- AND THOSE OF THE COUNTIES ARE WILLING TO ADMIT. TO CENTER PIN ON YOUR TURN YEAH YES ON AND ON MY END -- I WITH ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWER -- I THINK AT THIS POINT -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION CONTINUE -- SO I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL. FOR TODAY -- BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR HELP THAN OTHERS AND TRYING TO HELP ME -- AND THINK OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SAME SITUATION TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS. PROBLEM THAT. YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THE FEES RIGHT NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO FIND THE SUCH PROGRAMS THAT -- AND RECOGNIZING CERTAINLY THE COUNTY STILL LOCAL CONTROL HAVE TO DATE CERTAIN PRIORITIES AS WELL BUT CERTAINLY HOPING WE CAN FIND WAYS. TO TRY TO FIND -- YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT REALLY DO HELP OUR KEYS OF COLOR -- BE ABLE -- TO WHO WHO ARE BASICALLY SUFFERING FROM THE VERY JUSTICE INTEGRAL JUSTICE SYSTEM I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO DRESS AS WELL WITH THIS BILL IN OTHER BILLS THANK YOU. I I AGREE I THINK THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE IN IN ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION IS ALSO RECOGNIZING THE WORK ON THAT'S BEEN DONE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR SUB FIVE CHAIR. PARTICULARLY IF YOU TALK ABOUT RECIDIVISM AND REENTRY PROGRAMS AND DOLLARS -- WE'VE DONE -- A YEOMAN'S JOB OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF INVESTING IN THE AISLES LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH BOTH THE COUNTY CAN PROBATION DEPARTMENTS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHO SOME WOULD ARGUE PROBABLY. BETTER EQUIPPED TO ENGAGE IN RECIDIVISM ACTIONS AND SO -- I THINK IT'S NOT A ZERO SUM GAME BUT THERE HAVE BEEN PUBLIC DOLLARS ALLOCATED FOR THOSE KIND OF PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES THANK YOU. A MAN PRO TEM. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES I AM GLAD -- THE ORDER HAPPENED AS IT DID BECAUSE I REALLY JUST WANT -- TO SPEAK TO A CALL I GOT FROM A CONSTITUENT. AND IT'S CLEAR THAT OUR SYSTEM NEEDS REHABILITATION. FIVE FOUR YEARS OF ASSESSING FEES EXCEPT FOR THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE GONE. THROUGH IN A WAY TO COVER OUR COST IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT REHABILITATION AND A COMMITMENT TO TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THIS. THEN WE HAVE SYSTEMATIC CHANGES WE HAVE TO MAKE. I WAS THRILLED TO HEAR THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WAS DOING THIS BILL BECAUSE AFTER THE BILL DEADLINE I GET A CALL FROM A CONSTITUENT. YOUNG MEN OF COLOR. WHO HAD SERVED HIS TIME IN PRISON -- FOR A VERY LOW LEVEL OFFENSE BUT HE WAS IN PRISON. AND SINCE. HE DIDN'T HAVE A VERY GOOD BEGINNING IN LIFE WHICH HE DIDN'T EXACTLY WANT TO HAVE TO SHARE WITH THE WORLD. BUT HE HAD GOTTEN OUT OF PRISON. HE HAD HAS A FULL TIME JOB. BUT HE NEEDS HIS GED SO WE HAD SENT HIM OFF TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IN THE TRADES. WHO WAS HOLDING A SLOT FOR HIM? IN ORDER FOR HIM AS HE GOT HIS G. D. HE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET INTO THIS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. AND HIS HIS SALARY WOULD TRIPLE. YOUNG MAN WITH A FIANCE WHOSE FAMILY HAD EMBRACED HIM SO WE HAD A NEW BEGINNING A NEW SUPPORT STRUCTURE A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL -- WHO HAS A SISTER AW FIANCE HERE'S A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS EXCITED ABOUT LIFE? AND THEN THE BILL CAME. FROM -- CORRECTIONS AND FROM THE FERRET FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND HIS WAGES WERE GARNISHED. HE COULD NO LONGER GO TO THE G. D. PROGRAM AT NIGHT AT ECC. BECAUSE HE HAD TO WORK DOUBLE. BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO HAVE HIS WAGES GARNISHED AND HE COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF HIS NEW FAMILY. AND HE WAS A SHAME BECAUSE NOW HE HAD TO ADMIT. TO HIS NEW FAMILY THAT HE HAD SERVED TIME FOR A LOW LEVEL CRIME. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. AND THEN OF COURSE WE CHECKED INTO THE SYSTEM TO SEE COULD WE WORK TO ASSIST HIM IN OUR CONSTITUENTS SERVICES CAPACITY. THAT THE FEES WOULD BE STRETCHED OUT AND HE COULD PAY LESS OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. TURNS OUT THEY OWED HIM MONEY. LOWER. BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN ASSESSED WRONG BUT IT TOOK US INTERVENING IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM REVIEW THE SITUATION. AND COME FORWARD WITH A SOLUTION AND I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW IMPORTANT CONSTITUENT SERVICES. IS FOR ALL OF US AND THIS YOUNG MAN. IS RELEASED BUT WHEN HE LEARNED THAT HE WAS GOING TO GET A REFUND FOR STUFF HE IT OR IT MONEY HE'D ALREADY PAID. HE WAS AFRAID TO SPEND. BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID. THAT HE THEY WOULD FIND OUT AND CORRECT THE SYSTEM. AND HE LIVES PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK HE AND HIS FAMILY SO. I BELIEVE IN THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT FORCES US TO REALLY FACE SOME FACTS AND CORRECT SOME SITUATIONS THAT WE WERE IN BECAUSE OF BUDGETARY PROBLEMS I GET IT. BUT NOW IT'S UP TO US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO PAY FOR IN ORDER. THAT OUR SYSTEM FULLY WORKS AND FOR THOSE WHO REALLY DO WANT A SECOND CHANCE AND ARE PREPARED TO TAKE IT THAT THEY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND THAT HE CAN GET HIS GED AND HE CAN GO INTO THAT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND HE CAN PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY WITH DIGNITY BECAUSE HE HAS REALLY -- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I KNOW THERE IS MORE TO BE DONE IT IS OUR JOB TO DO THAT WORK. LET'S KEEP THIS MOVE IN REQUESTED I'VE. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS SENATE ROTH. THANK THEIR PRESENT COLLEAGUES -- FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY -- WE USE FEES IN THE STATE TO FUND SOME VERY VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS. THAT ARE CONDUCTED CERTAINLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN OUR COUNTIES AND IN OUR COURTS -- AND WE NEED TO HELP THE COUNTIES AND THE COURTS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS. IF WE ELIMINATE THE FEES THAT CURRENTLY FUND THEM. THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE BUDGET BACK FILL HOW MUCH. WHAT DO THEY COLLECT HOW DO THEY USE THE MONEY? AND WHERE DOES IT GO. IT'S OUR JOB TO CONTINUE THESE PRGRAMS BUT TO DO SO WE NEED THE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT THE BUDGET AUGMENTATION NEEDS TO BE. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THEM. HELLO MY PHONE IS LIGHTING UP FROM THE COUNTY THAT I'M PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT SO IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT AT THIS POINT TIME SOMEBODY'S FINALLY RUNNING THE CALCULATOR. TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH MONEY THEY COLLECT. OKAY WHAT THE COLLECTION RATE IS AND WHAT IT'S USED FOR AND WHAT THEY WOULD NEED FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM. THIS IS IF WE ELIMINATE FEES. PROBLEM IS THE JOBS NOT DONE NOT ALL THE COUNTIES OF REPORTED AND WE REALLY DON'T KNOW SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. THIS IS COME UP THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE INVOLVED IN BUDGET CONVERSATIONS OF A FEW YEARS AGO MAY RECALL IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION -- THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO ELIMINATE SOME COURT RESERVE FUNDS. AND WE HAS JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHAT HOW MUCH MONEY. TO THE COURT SYSTEMS HAVE IN RESERVE ACCOUNTS. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE COURT SYSTEM COULDN'T TELL US. FOR THIS SITUATION IS REALLY NO DIFFERENT WHAT WE NEED TO DO FRANKLY IS WE NEED TO FORCE ALL OF THE COUNTY IS NOT JUST A FEW. AND OUR COURT SYSTEM. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE FIGURES. TO US SO WE CAN DETERMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF FEEL IN THE NATION AND THE AMOUNT OF THE BUDGET BACK FILL THAT WE NEED. TO TO MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNTIES IN THE COURTS AND THE REST ARE MADE WHOLE AND THAT THESE VERY VERY IMPORTANT. PROGRAMS CONTINUE. IF IN FACT WE FIND WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THAT THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES THAT SIMPLY CANNOT BE MADE UP. OF THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER. DESPITE THESE VERY VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY ARGUMENTS THAT OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN -- PUSHING MOVING FORWARD HERE ON THE FLOOR. THEN IT WILL NEED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THIS BILL BECAUSE THE PROGRAMS NEED TO CONTINUE AND IF THE STATE BUDGET CAN'T SUPPORT THEM. THEN WE MAY NEED TO DECIDE THAT THERE'S CERTAIN FEES AND NEED TO REMAIN IN PLACE IN ORDER TO FUND THE PROGRAMS THAT WE VALUE HERE. SO I'M GOING TO VOTE TODAY. TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND TO MOVE IT TO THE ASSEMBLY. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE VERY VERY TALENTED AUTHOR THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THIS ISSUE. WELL HOPEFULLY GATHER THE INFORMATION THAT SHE NEEDS FROM THE COUNTIES IN THE COURTS TO DETERMINE WHICH FEES WE CAN ELIMINATE AND WHICH HOW MUCH MONEY WE CAN DO RE DIRECT OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET BACK DOWN TO THE LOCAL SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS. AND IF THE MONEY WE FIND IN THE BUDGET IS INSUFFICIENT WILL HAVE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS BILL. IN TERMS OF WHICH FEES ARE ELIMINATED. AND WHICH CONTINUE TO REMAIN SO. I'M GOING TO DO JUST THAT A RESERVE -- THE RIGHT TO RECONSIDER MY POSITION ON THE TRIP BACK TO THIS FLOOR. AND I THINK THE CENTER FOR LOS ANGELES FOR FINALLY ATTEMPTING TO WRAP HER ARMS AROUND IS EXTRAORDINARILY HUGE ISSUE. TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE THE THE FEE ISSUE IN THE STATE FINALLY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ROBB SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. YOU AND PRESIDENT OF THE AUTHOR DISASTROUS IS IT APPROPRIATE. FOR A STATE CONTINUE THE FINE PEOPLE TO HAVE THEM PAY ADDITIONAL FEES EN EN I RECALL EARLY ON WHEN I WAS PRACTICING WHY DID SOME CRIMINAL DEFENSE. AND I TOOK A CLIENT DOWN -- TO THE WINDOW TO PAY THEIR FINAL WE'RE WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS THEY WERE TOLD BY THE CLERK WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE HERE WE'RE GOING TO REFER YOU OVER TO CENTRAL COLLECTION YOU'RE GONNA PAY THEM THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS. AND IF YOU'RE LATE YOU COULD PAY THEM INTEREST AND IT BECAME THIS WHOLE INDUSTRY THAT WE'VE SET UP SO THAT FOLKS CAN MAKE FOLKS CAN MAKE MONEY SO THE ANSWER IN THE LEASE IN. THIS ONE SANDERS MINE IS IS. NO IT'S NO LONGER APPROPRIATE FOR US TO DO THIS YOU KNOW YEARS AGO WE TALK ABOUT THE FOUNDING FATHERS HERE AND I HAVE A SPECIAL -- FOR AFFINITY TOWARDS BANKRUPTCY AND WE ELIMINATED DEBTORS PRISONS WHEN WE SET UP THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WE DID A LOT OF OTHER THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT INDENTURED SERVITUDE WAS NO LONGER -- VALUED IN IT WAS TO STAY IN THE POND AND WE SAID NOT NOT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHEN THE CORD SITS AND TELLS YOU OKAY YOU GOT YOUR DO YOU WHY. YOU GOTTA DO FIFTY TWO WEEKS OF ALCOHOL SCHOOL IN AND COMPLETE THIS AND DO THIS AND THEN YOU PAY A FINE IN THE FEE. THAT'S THE CONDITION OF YOUR PROBATION IF YOU DON'T PAY THAT FINE IN THE FEE AND ALL THE PENALTIES AND ALL THE INTERESTS THAT ACCUMULATE. EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE DONE ALL THE THINGS THAT THE COURT HAS ORDERED YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR PROBATION SO YOU'RE STILL IN THE FALL WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF THE CALL. THE TERM OF YOUR PROBATION THE MONEY. IT'S THE MONEY THAT PROHIBITS YOU FROM FROM PAYING WORST. COMPLETING YOUR SERVICE AND THERE ARE SIMPLY HUNDREDS. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THE FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY BUT FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRING THIS FORWARD IT'S LONG OVERDUE WE SHOULD NO LONGER BE TREATING PEOPLE CRIMINALIZING THEIR INABILITY TO PAY. THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE CENTER PORCHES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- I WANT TO COMMEND THE THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES I THINK. ARE WE FINALLY BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE IN ISSUE THAT THING'S BEEN SIMMERING FOR SOME TIME. ON WHETHER OR NOT -- FEES AND FINES AND SO FORTH SHOULD BE ASSESSED WHAT I'M HEARING FROM MY COLLEAGUES -- IN THIS BODY ARE THAT THEY'RE NOT HAPPY -- ABOUT HOW FEES AND FINES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED. WHAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THOUGH IS THAT? WOULD IT NOT BE MORE HELPFUL. IF THE QUESTION THAT IS POSED. WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE POSED BY. ODD THIS LEGISLATION BE ANSWERED FIRST. AND WE'RE GONNA HEARD FROM THE CENTER FROM RIVERSIDE -- THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. HAVE WE ABUSE HAVE A HAS OUR SYSTEM ABUSED THE FINES AND FEES STRUCTURE AS A MEANS OF SUPPLANTING LOST REVENUE -- FROM THE STATE IN ELSEWHERE. ON THE FLIP SIDE -- I'M CONCERNED THAT CERTAIN COUNTIES MIGHT BE -- HARMED IN THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF PROVIDING -- FUNCTIONS AND SERVICES THAT WE HEARD FROM THE CENTER FROM SACRAMENTO. SO BUT I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT PRESENTS A QUESTION. BUT DOESN'T ANSWER IT. EVEN THOUGH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT. IN WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED. ULTIMATELY IF IT IS COST INEFFECTIVE. BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT VERSES THE RATE OF COLLECTION. WOULD IT NOT BE HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US TO HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD. AND ULTIMATELY ALSO LEAVE IT UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE COUNTIES. BECAUSE THERE'S A MERITORIOUS PROGRAMS IN THERE THERE'S THERE'S A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OF FEES THAT ARE ASSESSED AT CERTAIN CERTAIN COUNTIES PUBLIC DEFENDER FEES THAT ARE ASSESSED. SO I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK I WAS WONDERING -- IF THIS MIGHT BE BE MORE HELPFUL TO WIN THROUGH A JOINT AUDIT. OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THEN CAME BACK WITH A COMPLETE ASSESSMENT -- BUT WITH THAT I THINK -- I'LL PROBABLY ESTáN LAY OFF ON THIS BUT THAT'S WHERE I THINK HE WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL FOR THIS TO GO. THANK YOU SENATOR BOARD JUST CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SAT. I WANT A LIFE THANK THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR INSIGHT AND WISDOM. IN BRINGING THIS ISSUE -- TO US -- TODAY -- I THINK THAT MANY OF THE THE ISSUES THAT THIS BILL PROPOSES -- TO I DEAL WITH ARE THE CORRECT ONES -- AND I AM I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I WOULD ASK THAT -- THE AUTHORS TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING WHICH IS THAT THIS IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF FEES. THEY ALL HAVE THEIR INTRICACIES -- AND PURPOSES -- AND THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT MAY MERIT A RE EXAMINATION WE PASSED A A FEW DAYS AGO. LEGISLATION BY THE SENATOR FROM THE PENINSULA ABOUT IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES -- AND THAT IS A FEE BUT IT TO SUBSIDIZE FEE ALL THESE ARE UNIQUE IN THERE'S CIRCUMSTANCE. AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT THAT CONTINUED EXAMINATION HAPPEN AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY. YEAH MY COMMITMENT THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER SENATOR HILL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES -- IN AYE AYE TO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR AUTHORS FOR THE THE GREAT EFFORT THAT THEY'VE PUT FORTH IN THIS TO REDUCE FEES AND AND AND CREATE A MORE FAIR SYSTEM AND THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SET THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT RUNNING A STOP SIGN AND IT'S THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR. BASED FEET IT'S TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE BUT IF YOU MAKE THAT ROLLING RIGHT TURN ON RED THAT HUNDRED DOLLAR BASED FEED GOES TO FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR ONE VIOLATION. AND IT IT LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATURE WE KNOW WE HAVE ADDED TO THOSE FEES ALONG THE WAY I KNOW IN MY TEN YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE I'VE. VOTED TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL FEES AND SO WE HAVE A I THINK THE OBLIGATION NOW TO LOOK AT THOSE FEES CRITICALLY. TO SEE IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE THIS SYSTEM EVEN MORE FAIR. AND EQUITABLE SO THAT THOSE WHO LEAST CAN AFFORD IT DON'T SUFFER MORE BECAUSE OF IT -- AND I DO APPRECIATE BY GOOD FRIEND FROM A RENDA. FOR HIS COMMENT RELATED TO IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES AS THE AUTHOR KNOWS THAT. OF REDUCING DRUNK DRIVING HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF OF MY LEGISLATIVE A TENURE. AND THE CURRENT STATUTE IN PLACE HAS SOME CHALLENGES. WITH THE AND THE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PART OF THAT IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS SO I APPRECIATE THE THE WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION SO THANK OF CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING THIS AND APPRECIATE RIVAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR HILL MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE. SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD AND THANK YOU FOR ALL MY COLLEAGUES WERE VERY RICH DISCUSSION I WOULD JUST SAY BRIEFLY IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW. IS THIS BILL NOW THE APPROPRIATE ACTION AS OPPOSED -- TO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR OR ASKING THE COUNTY SAYS AS HAS BEEN DONE -- IN ANY NUMBER OF VENUES OVER THE YEARS TO COME FORWARD WITH THEIR TRUE NUMBERS I WOULD JUST DIRECT MY COLLEAGUES ATTENTION TO AT LEAST JUST THREE REPORTS THAT I HAPPEN TO HAVE YOUR IN MY BINDER. CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES HIGH PAIN FOR PEOPLE LOW GAME FOR GOVERNMENT A CALL TO ACTION FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. PRODUCED BY THE FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO THE PROBLEM WITH PROBATION THE STUDY THE ECONOMIC AND RACIAL IMPACT OF PROBATION FEES OF CUT IN CALIFORNIA -- PUBLISHED BY A AT THE HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL AND IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL FINE IN FEES SYSTEM THE REPORT BY THE LEAD GENTLEST AND SO I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT LEADERS HAVE A PUT THEIR MIND TO REALLY TRY. TO ON WIND -- A PROCESS THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WE HELP FACILITATE. BECAUSE OF A STRUGGLING ECONOMY BECAUSE OF A STRUGGLING GENERAL FUND -- THIS WAS THE WAY TO CONTINUE TO FIND GOOD WORK. AND THE QUESTION IS IS IT FUNDING GOOD WORK THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS IT FUNDING. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE DON'T KNOW. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE COUNTIES IN THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT SERVE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO COME FORWARD TO PROVIDE CLARITY AND THEY HAVE NOT. AND SO PERHAPS THE SUIT COULD BE PERCEIVED AS THE STICK APPROACH AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR US TO REALLY GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY IF YOU WILL. IN DETERMINING HOW COUNTIES ARE USING THESE DOLLARS PAID ON THE BACKS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- BEEN SUBJUGATED TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AS I'VE SAID BEFORE I THE THE POINT OF THE BILL IN THE POINT OF ME ASKING YOU TO CONTINUE IT THE MOVE TO THE PROCESS I AM SURE IT WILL BE AMENDED IN THE ASSEMBLY WHICH WILL GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK. AND WE CAN HAVE A FULL DISCUSSION IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL IN THE COMEBACKS COMES BACK PARKING CURRENTS I'D MAKE COMMITMENTS TO MANY OF YOU TO KEEP YOU UPDATED AS WE GO ALONG THE PROCESS. I'M CLEAR ABOUT THE QUESTION AROUND THE INTERLOCK AT THE MISSION IN IRAQ DEVICES AGAIN THE MEMBERS WE TOOK AN APPROPRIATIONS. A REINSTATED THE FEE TO COVER THE COSTS FOR THE PROGRAM IT'S IN THE VICES AND THEMSELVES THAT WE STILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK OUT WANT LANGUAGE -- THAT WILL BE HELPFUL AND USEFUL TO ALL. AGAIN WE TOOK AMENDMENTS THAT APPROPRIATIONS BASED ON THE STATE WIDE SURVEY OF THOSE IMPACTED BY THE FEES TO REALLY SEE IF WE COULD FIND THE SWEET SPOT. IN TERMS OF THE GREEN THE THE FEES ARE THE LISA GREGIS -- AND FOR PEOPLE IMPACTED BY THE FEES THEY WERE WILLING TO STEP UP AND SAY WE APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF THIS BILL WE UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL IMPACT. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO WEIGH IN IN TERMS OF WHAT THESE WE THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO REMAIN IN. AND SIXTY MILLION. IS WHAT'S BEEN PUT BACK INTO THE CAR FOR IF YOU WILL AS A RESULT OF US A MILLION THE BILL TO REINSTATE SOME FEES. SO I THINK THAT WE THE STAKEHOLDERS THE THOSE WHO ARE PAYING THE FEES HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE. THE HAVE A MEANINGFUL -- STRATEGIC APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PUBLIC POLICY CULTURE SHIFT THAT WE BELIEVE IS APPROPRIATE TO TAKE PLACE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND WITH THAT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ALLOW.

TWENTY NINETEEN SB ONE IS SENSIBLE AND NECESSARY LEGISLATION IT MAKES FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARDS. FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER PROTECTION ENFORCEABLE UNDER STATE LAW FOR THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. IN WASHINGTON ROLES THEM BACK. SINCE THIS ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE IT IS SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINED DECADES OF REGULATORY PROGRESS. DOZENS OF VITAL CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND ENDANGERED SPECIES STANDARDS HAVE BEEN WEAKENED OR ELIMINATED. THE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH SAFEGUARDING OUR HEALTH AND OUR NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY THE INDUSTRY'S THEY'RE MEANT TO REGULATE. A COLD LOBBYIST NOW RUNS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND OIL LOBBYIST IS IN CHARGE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR. AND THEIR SYSTEMATICALLY UNDER ENFORCING THE LAWS THAT ARE STILL ON THE BOOKS. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED A BUDGET BLUEPRINT THAT WOULD REDUCE THE FUNDING OF THE U. S.

AN INSPECTION OF DANGEROUS CHEMICALS AND PESTICIDES HAVE FALLEN BY TWO THIRDS. SB ONE WOULD INSULATE CALIFORNIA FROM THE RECKLESS APPROACH TO OUR HEALTH AND OUR SAFETY. IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT WHATEVER ACTIONS THE NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION MAY TAKE CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT FOR YEARS DECADES EVEN. IN SOME CASES AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW. THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER SAFE DRINKING WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES.

SENATE BILL 772% -- BRADFORD AN ACT RELATING TO ENERGY. SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SB SEVEN SEVEN TWO HELPS FILL A BIG GAP IN A ROW. TO OUR ENERGY GOALS AND DOES SO IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE THIS BILL ENABLES US TO START PROCURING BALK ENERGY STORAGE. WHICH ARE BOB GRADE WILL ABSOLUTELY NEED. WE MADE THIS DECISION LAST YEAR WITH US IF YOU ARE. ONE HUNDRED WHEN WE DECIDED TO PHASE OUT. FALSE OF FUEL POWER PLANTS RIGHT NOW NATURAL GAS GENERATION SERVES AS BOTH. BASS AMP PEAK LOAD WHEN REAP NOBLE ENERGIES CANNOT DO THE JOB FOLKS STORAGE WILL BACK UP WIND AND SOLAR. JUST LIKE GAS PLANTS DO NOW NEITHER TECHNOLOGY WORKS WITHOUT THE OTHER. WE NEED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON OUR GOALS AND START FILLING IN THE RESOURCE GAP. IF WE WAIT THE PROBLEM DOES NOT GO AWAY IT ONLY. BECOMES MORE EXPENSIVE. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A ADVOCATE FOR REPAIR PROTECTION AND AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED HERE WITH THIS MEASURE THIS BILL IS ABOUT ENSURE THAT OUR LOFTY GOALS TRANSLATE INTO AGREED THAT IS STILL RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTY AND BEYOND. THE ONE THING THAT WE GET OUT THROUGHOUT THE K. FORD'S RADICAL CHANGE THE NOW THE THING TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS THIS WORKS THIS TECHNOLOGY WORKS WE'VE SEEN IT WORK. THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET ELECTRICITY ASKED TO COME FROM DIVERSE IMBALANCE RESOURCES THIS HELP US ACHIEVE THAT GOAL BOOKSTORES IS ONE OF THE PIECES FOR FUTURE GRIT. BOOKSTORE TO WON'T BE THERE WHEN WE NEEDED UNLESS WE START NOW I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN SEVEN TWO IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'SLONG TERM ENERGY GOALS. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE ADOPTION OF PUMP STORAGE TECHNOLOGY AS A WAY TO MEET OUR 1100% RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO AS PASS UNDER SB. ONE HUNDRED THIS BILL IS CERTAINLY NOT PERFECT BUT I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING AMENDMENTS TO LIMIT THE TOLD NUMBER OF MEGAWATTS THAT WOULD BE AUTHORIZES A WAY TO MAKE SURE. ONLY THOSE PROJECTS WITH WIDESPREAD COMMUNITY SUPPORT MOVE FORWARD. I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WILLINGNESS TO KEEP WORKING ON THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS BILL PROTECTS A SACRED SITES EXIST ON NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL LANDS. PUMP STORAGE IS A PROVEN TECHNOLOGY AND WE NEED TO ADDED TO THE MIX OF RENEWABLE ENERGY OPTIONS TO MEET OUR GOALS FOR THESE REASONS I REQUEST A AYE VOTE IN SB. SEVEN SEVEN TWO AND PAUL THE AUTHOR FOR BEING A FORWARD THANK YOU SENATOR STONE. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. SEVEN SEVEN TWO LET ME BE BLUNT. ALLAYED DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER EXPECTS TO HAVE BROWN OUTS THIS SUMMER BECAUSE IT LACKS SUFFICIENT ENERGY WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN. IT'S POSSIBLE THATSOMEONE SOMEONE WILL DIE IN A SCORCHING HOUSE BECAUSE THERE ARE CONDITIONER ISN'T RUNNING OR KIDNEY DISEASE PATIENT SUFFERS BECAUSE THEY'RE DIALYSIS MACHINE DIALYSIS MACHINE CANNOT RUN. THESE BEST POTENTIAL HUMAN TRAGEDIES UNFORTUNATELY SHINE THE LIGHT ON THE LACK OF ENERGY GRADE MANAGEMENT AND FOR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY NEEDED IN OUR ENERGY SECTOR. SB SEVEN SEVEN TWO COULD BE PART OF A GOOD GOVERNANCE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD ON OUR OUR PS SYSTEM THAT WE COULD BRING EQUITY TO HELP OUR PS COSTS IMPACT DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA REPAIRS. REGIONALLY AND SOCIAL SOCIO ECONOMICALLY I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE SENATOR FROM GUARDINO TO PROVIDE. TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR THE PO USE AGRICULTURE BUSINESS CONCERNS AND OTHERS THAT WILL PURCHASE THESE STORED RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND COUNT THIS ENERGY PRODUCTION TOWARD THE OUR PS GOALS OF THE DAY. I SINCERELY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THE USER CABALLERO ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. THE RED FOR WOULD TAKE A QUESTION YES PLEASE PROCEED. WILL THIS BE PAID FOR THROUGH THE RATES OF ALL RATEPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MARK THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING MANSON ABROAD FOR YOU MY CLOTHES YES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS WHO HAVE SPOKEN OUT ON THIS ISSUE IN A TO ISSUE THAT. I I BELIEVES TIMES COM ALL WE'VE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT HAVING A BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF DIVERSE RESOURCES BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR OUR PS. OPERA FOLIO THAT'S NOT THE CASE -- WE'VE EXCLUDED A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT CLEARLY WORK A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE CLEAR CLEAN AND RELIABLE THAT ARE BASED LOW THAT OUR DISPATCH BULL. AND BULK STORAGE IS ONE OF THOSE TECHNOLOGIES WHOSE TIME HAS COME. WE'VE HEARD THE CRITICS OF SAYING IT'S GONNA COST MORE BUT WE'VE PROMOTED A OUR PS PROGRAM FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS AS COST EVERY RAPIER WE CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE WIND AND SOLAR THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE THERE'S NO SUCH CONCERN OR CRY ABOUT REPAIRS PAN IT NON SOLAR CUSTOMERS CONTINUE THIS SUBSIDIZES. THIS IS A APPROACH THAT WILL HELP US PROVIDE A RELIABLE SOURCE WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE DUNKERQUE AND THE FACT THAT WE PRODUCE MORE ENERGY TO SOLAR DURING THE DAY.

NOT AT HIS DESK [inaudible] RUN FAST. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FIFTY FOUR BY SENATOR ALAN AND ECHOING THE SOLID WASTE. WHEN YOU'RE READY SENATOR ALAN? THINK ABOUT A PRESIDENT MEMBERS. MEMBERS ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RECYCLERS HAVE A CRISIS ON THEIR HANDS. FOLKS MAY KNOW THAT CHINA HAS JUST IMPLEMENTED. THE NATIONAL SORT POLICY. WHICH I A DECISION IT'S NOW BEEN FOLLOWED BY OTHER ASIAN NATIONS. TO NO LONGER ACCEPT OUR RECYCLING. WHEN THAT HAS SINGLE HANDEDLY BECAUSE THE BOTTOM TO FALL OUT ON A RECYCLING MARKETS? IT'S COSTING CITIES AND COUNTIES RIGHT HERE IN CITY CALIFORNIA. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SO IT TURNED OUT THAT IN THE PAST. CHINA HAD BEEN ACCEPTING. U. S.. IN CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA THAT RATE WAS AT SO HAD MORE OVER HALF MAJORITY ARE CYCLE MATERIALS GOING. OFF THE CHINA. AND OF COURSE-- AT THE TIME ACCORDING TO OUR YCLES DATA NUMBERS THREE THROUGH SEVEN OF OF RECYCLED. PLASTICS WERE FETCHING ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS PER TON IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE PAYING ROUGHLY TEN DOLLARS A TON TO DISPOSE OF IT. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING TO PAY PEOPLE IT USED TO BE A REVENUE GENERATOR OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES AND HAVING TO PAY PEOPLE. TO TAKE CAN RECYCLE OUR MATERIAL. SO AS A RESULT MORE MORE OFTEN THAT MEANS THE MATERIAL IS BEING LANDFILLS. AND EVEN WHEN WE DILIGENTLY SORT OUR RECYCLABLES INTO OUR BLUE BINS. THE MATERIAL IS LESS LIKELY TO BE PROCESSED RECYCLED NOW. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS UNSUSTAINABLE AND I I JUST ASK YOU TO TALK TO YOUR CITIES. AND YOUR WAIST -- FOLKS TO ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES IN FULL SOME USED TO MAKE NEARLY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FROM RESEARCH RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING NOW THE CITY'S PROJECTED TO PAY. NEARLY THE SAME AMOUNT TO DISPOSE OF THE WASTE CULVER CITY. IN OUR BUDGET CHERRIES DISTRICT ONCE MINUTE HALF MILLION IN REVENUE NOW THEY PAY ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. CITY OF LA THE NET REVENUES WERE WERE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION FOR RECYCLING NOW THEY'RE LOSING MONEY. IN ADDITION OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE USING MONEY IN TERMS OF A LITTER CLEANUP -- EVERY SINGLE YEAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SPENDING A NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. IN ONGOING EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT LITTER IN THE STREETS STORM DRAINS. PARKS AND WATERWAYS. AND BEACH CLEANUP SIMPLY CAN'T KEEP PACE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE ITEMS WHICH CONTINUE. TO GROW EXPONENTIALLY. SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE HAVE -- INFRASTRUCTURAL CRISIS ON OUR HANDS THERE'S A FINANCIAL CRISIS ON OUR HANDS. THIS BILL REQUIRES CAL RECYCLE TO CONDUCT A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT TRULY ENGAGES INDUSTRY. AND ALL THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO BRING TOGETHER MANUFACTURERS RETAILERS CITIES COUNTIES HOLLERS RECYCLERS TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THE BEST SOLUTIONS TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. IT WILL TAKE A SUITE OF TOOLS SUCH AS MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT STANDARDS EXTENDED PRODUCERS ONCE ABILITY -- TO BOLSTER THEIR CYCLING MARKETS TO MAKE COLLECTION RECYCLING PROFITABLE AGAIN WHILE ENSURING THE MANUFACTURES HAVE A STEADYING CLEAN SUPPLY OF MATERIAL. TO MAKE IT PROFITABLE. THE BILL PROVIDES FOR A LONG HONORING UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY BEFORE IT'S FULLY IMPLEMENTED -- THIS VERY LONG LEAD TIME WILL ALLOW MANUFACTURERS TO EITHER SWITCH TO MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS WERE BY USING RECYCLED CONTENT THEIR PACKAGING ENSURE THE MATERIAL. THAT THEY WANT TO USE MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL. I KNOW THAT EVEN ALWAYS SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WE STILL SOME WORK TO DO I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF YOU -- ABOUT -- THE ISSUE OF OF OF GIVING POWER CYCLE ALL OF THIS DISCRETION. HI. I MEAN ULTIMATELY THIS REALLY IS GOING TO BE THE PROCESS OF OF THE THE THE CAN RESULT OF A VERY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. I'M CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT MORE GUIDANCE I'M ALSO OPEN TO INCLUDING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN. TRACK THE STAKEHOLDER IN REGULATORY PROCESS IS A PLAY. NOW WE ALSO WILL KEEP THEM ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THREE Q. OVERSIGHT SACHA. WE HAD A SERIES VERY PRODUCTIVE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS IN A FURNACE THE SUPPORT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES SEE SACRIFICE THE RC MANY THE STATE'S. HOLLERS RECYCLERS OF WHAT THE FOLKS ON THE BUSINESS SIDE IN THE WASTE MANAGEMENT WORLD. I'M VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS TO GET THIS BILL RIGHT NOW ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY -- AS WE CONTINUE THIS VITALLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION -- THAT IS SO DRAMATICALLY IMPACTING OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES. THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR CHIANG THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM PRESIDENT. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE BILL. ARE COMMENDABLE AND WE HAVE A POLLUTION PROBLEM THAT IMPACTS OUR FOOD SUPPLY AN OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS AND AND I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT'S ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS. THAT WE CAN FIND PLASTIC PRODUCTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MARIANA TRENCH -- I DO BELIEVE HOWEVER THE BILL PUTS TOO MUCH FAITH IN STATE DEPARTMENTS IS NINE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM. IT DOESN'T REALLY DOESN'T GIVE ENOUGH TIME -- TO PUT THAT PLAN IN PLACE BECAUSE REGULATIONS AND PLANS AT THIS SIZE AND SCOPE TAKE TIME. FOR THAT REASON WAS THE OFF THE BILL TODAY HOWEVER I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH. THE AUTHOR AND STAKEHOLDERS AND I HAVE TO SAY. THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS AND WONDERFUL BECAUSE WE WERE JUST RIGHT BACK THERE IN THE CHAMBER TRYING TO TO WORK IT ALL OUT AND I KNOW. THAT. HE'S GOING TO PUT IN THE THE THE WORK IN THE TIME TO TO MEET WITH ALL OF US IN TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME. IT TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THERE AND I REALLY DO WANT TO GET THERE I BELIEVE IT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT COULD. BE BROUGHT SUPPORT SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR ENVIRONMENT AND FOR BRINGING THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE US. THANK YOU CENTER CHANCELLOR GLAZER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS WE OFFERING -- DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES TO OUR LIFE HERE ON THE SENATE FLOOR. THOSE WHO -- WE'RE NOT AWARE FOR FOUR YEARS I SERVED ON MY SOLID WASTE -- A REGIONAL BOARD -- IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS I AND MANY OF YOU RECALL THAT LAST YEAR I KERRY LEGISLATION TO TRY TO PATCHWORK OUR SYSTEM OF SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING THAT IS DETERIORATING. I AS THE AUTHOR THIS BILL IS SO CORRECTLY DESCRIBED. OF AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE US. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENTIONS ARE GOOD ONES AND I THINK HIS BILL IS HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S THE THING WE HAVE TO DO -- THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM -- WE HAVE TO GET IN FRONT OF IT WE CAN'T IGNORE IT. AND I THINK THAT'S THE INTENTION OF THIS THE AUTHOR FROM SANTA MONICA. AND IT'S WHY I WANTED TO ADVANCE IT IN CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT I THINK DESERVE ATTENTION AS THAT WORK AT AND THAT -- THAT -- COMMUNICATION -- WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUES. THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE NOT BUILT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO RECYCLE -- LIKE THIS BILL WOULD POTENTIALLY REQUIRE AND THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION -- BUT THERE'S A REASON THAT WE CAN'T RECYCLE LOT OF PLASTICS HERE I IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS -- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THEN THE MACHINERY AND AND ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT SO. AS WE LOOK TO THESE -- HIGH POLLUTING PLASTICS SINGLE USE PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY IF WE'RE GONNA SAY. YOU GOT TO RECYCLE IT THERE HAS TO BE ABLE AWAY -- PURSES TO SHIPPING IT AND A CONTAINER TO ANOTHER COUNTRY -- AND SECONDLY. I AM SKEPTICAL ABOUT SENDING ALL THIS DECISION MAKING TO A STATE AGENCY TO A STATE BUREAUCRACY YES WE HAVE POLITICS ON THI FLOOR IT DOES AFFECT THE CHOICES THAT WE MAKE -- BUT THEY'RE ALSO POLITICS IN THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY WAY TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE CHOICES THAT THEY THEY NEED TO MAKE GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF THE SINGLE USE RECYCLED PRODUCTS SO I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR IS NEAR THE BILL IN THE RIGHT WAY. TO FOCUS ON THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS. BUT I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME AND BOUNCE THAT WE CAN EXERCISE AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURESO I ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR IN HIS GOOD WORK. TO LOOK FOR WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN -- ADVANCE THE IMPORTANT GOALS BUT STILL PROVIDE A LEGISLATIVE ROLE THAT'S IMPORTANT I IN THIS IN THIS AREA SO WITH THAT I WOULD URGE EIGHT AND I'VE. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT AND A MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND WHILE THE BILL IS TITLED IN -- PLASTICS AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY. THE ERRANT BY OBVIOUSLY M. SOMEONE WHO IS FEELS VERY STRONGLY ABOUT PROTECTING OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENTS. AND SUCH FROM THIS TYPE OF POLLUTION THE REASON THAT I'M REALLY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS BECAUSE WE ARE IN A I'LL CALL IT A A GARBAGE CRISIS RIGHT NOW AND I SEE GARBAGE CRISIS. OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT CALL IT A RECYCLING CRISIS BUT WE SO MUCH OF OUR INTO HIGHER WASTE. INDUSTRY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS DESIGNED [inaudible] TO IN FACT. IDENTIFY A LARGE STORE A LARGE PORTION OF WHAT WE OTHERWISE MIGHT CONSIDER THE WASTE STREAM TO BE RECYCLABLE MATERIALS MATERIALS THAT WOULD. BE COLLECTED SEPARATELY AND THEN REMADE INTO A SECONDARY PRODUCT. NOW IN THE US UP UNTIL LIKE MUCH OF OUR MANUFACTURING YOU KNOW WE WE USED TO HAVE A RELATIVELY ROBUST -- SYSTEM OF MANUFACTURERS WHO WOULD TAKE THESE SECONDARY MATERIALS AND MAKE A NEW PRODUCT WE DON'T ANY LONGER THERE ARE VERY VERY FEW ANYWHERE IN THE US. THAT TAKE A MATERIAL AND REMANUFACTURING SO THAT MEANT THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE COLLECTED THAT WE DIDN'T PUT IN A LANDFILL OR DIDN'T COMPOST. HAD TO BE SENT SOMEWHERE ELSE PRIMARILY TO ASIA CHINA. AND SOMEWHAT INDIA AND THEY WOULD THEN TAKE THAT STUFF. AND TURN IT INTO ANOTHER PRODUCT. WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES DEVELOP A MIDDLE CLASS AS THIS HAPPENED IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE IN ASIA. THEY START PRODUCING AS MUCH OF THESE BY PRODUCTS AS WE DO. SO THEY NO LONGER NEED TO PURCHASE OUR MATERIAL. THEY HAVE ENOUGH FOR THEIR OWN. SO THEY BASICALLY YOU KNOW WHETHER WE CALL IT CHINA SOARED WHETHER WE COULD SAY IT'S A REACTION TO TERRACE OR WHATEVER WHAT IT BASICALLY IS. IS THAT ALL OF THE SECONDARY MATERIALS MANUFACTURERS IN THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE ENOUGH FOR THEIR OWN STUFF THEY DON'T NEED TO BUY IT FROM US. AND THAT'S WHAT WE IS SERIOUSLY HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN EVEN GREATER SO WE THINK IT'S BAD RIGHT NOW. WITHIN A CERTAIN CITY YEARS AS OTHER ECONOMIES DEVELOP MORE AND MORE MIDDLE CLASS. AND THEY KNOW. PRODUCE MORE IT'S A LUXURY TO PRODUCE WASTE PRODUCE MORE WASTE OR QUOTE UNQUOTE RECYCLABLES THEY WILL HAVE NO INTEREST IN PURCHASING HOURS. AND WHAT WERE ALREADY SEEN WITH THIS COLLAPSE OF MARKETS IS THAT WHETHER IT'S OUR HAULER WASTE MANAGEMENT OR REPUBLIC SERVICES OR RECOLOGY OR WHETHER WE HAVE SOME OF THE COMMUNITY BASED HOLLERS WHICH EXIST IN LOTS OF COMMUNITIES WHETHER SAN DIEGO. OR ALAMEDA COUNTY CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. THEY ARE TAKING THEIR MATERIALS TO THE PROCESSOR WHO BAILS AND SUCH AND THEN IT SITS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A MARKET THEY CAN'T SELL. SO WE NEED TO GO BACK TO PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY. GET BACK HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE MATERIALS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RECYCLE BECAUSE WHAT WE RELIED ON IS MARKETS DON'T EXIST ANYMORE. SO FROM A FROM A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW AND FROM A GARBAGE REPAIR POINT OF VIEW AND WE TALK A LOT ABOUT TRYING TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS. WELL WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT. OUR REGULAR RATE PAYERS WHO PAID THEIR MONTHLY FEES FOR GARBAGE AND RECYCLING FROM HUGE INCREASES IN FEES UNLESS WE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MATERIALS. THAT WE ARE EITHER PACKAGING TO SELLABLE CELL SOMEWHERE ELSE OR QUOTE UNQUOTE WASTING AND WITH THAT I ENCOURAGE AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER SENATOR WIENER. VERY MUCH BETTER PRESIDENT I RISE -- AS A JOINT AUTHOR OF AS TWO FIFTY FOUR I WANT TO THANK THE CENTER OF UP IN SANTA MONICA FOR HIS. WORK ON THIS BILL AS PART OF HIS BROADER WORK -- TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR OCEANS AND OUR WATER WAYS A SINGLE USE PLASTICS ON ARE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR -- IN THE UNDERMINING OF THE HEALTH OF OUR OCEANS OF OUR OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS -- OF OTHER WATER WAYS -- PLASTICS ARE FRANKLY STRANGLING -- ARE THE HEALTH OF OUR OCEANS STRANGLING ARE -- WITHIN OCEANS KILLING -- WILDLIFE -- JUST CAUSING MASSIVE CONTAMINATION -- THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM -- AND IT'S TIME TO MOVE PAST BABY STEPS. TO ADDRESS IT WE NEED A BOLD ACTION IN THIS BILL WILL PUT US IN A DIRECTION TO T. BOLD ACTION IN REDUCING SINGLE USE CLASSICS -- AND AND HAVING HEALTHIER OCEANS AND RIVERS ETCETERA AS A RESULT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER SIR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THE AUTHOR A STATED THAT -- ONE OF THE REASONS THE OPPONENTS HER POSES AT TO IT SEATS MORE THIRTY TWO CALORIE CYCLE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHY THIS HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED BEFORE THE BILL CAME TO THE FLOOR TODAY. YOU LOOK AT THE BILL AND YOU SAY TWENTY FOUR NEW POSITIONS AT THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS HERE'S ANOTHER BUDGET BUSTER. COSTS. AND WERE IMPOSING ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR A DIFFICULT MANDATE. WHEN WE SHOULD BE LOOKING? AT THE FREE MARKET FOR SOLUTIONS WITH. UPCOMING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH IT SHOULD BE A ONE TWO AS OPOSED TO I HAVE TO I THINK WE CAN WORK WITH INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE ALL SHARE. HOPEFULLY THE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING -- IN OUR LANDFILLS AND IN OUR OCEANS SO I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT. THIS HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CLOSING REMARKS FROM THE AUTHOR FROM SANTA MONICA. YOU CENTER MORE LOG MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATE ROTH. THING THAT ARE PRESENT COLLEAGUES I'M -- GENERALLY NOT A FAN OF IMPOSING. MANDATES ON BUSINESS BUT IN LISTENING TO NPR THE OTHER MORNING IN THE AND THE FACT THAT -- COUNTRIES THAT WE HAVE SHIPPED THIS STUFF TOO APPARENTLY OF DECIDED THAT THEY DON'T WANT ANYMORE AND THEY'RE GOING TO SHIP IT BACK TO US. A REALLY ILLUSTRATES THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE A CRISIS -- I'M NOT THE I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET TO OUR ABILITY. TO TO MEET THE THE THRESHOLD THAT THE BILL SETS OUT. TO I THINK WE MAY HAVE -- TO CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD IF IT MOVES FORWARD OUT OF THIS HOUSE AND ALSO PERHAPS. TAKE A LOOK AT THE AGENCY THAT WE'VE ENTRUSTED THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO TO MAKE SURE THAT IN FACT. CAL RECYCLE IS THE APPROPRIATE CHOICE BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING FAST AND WE NEED TO COUPLE THIS BILL. WITH A A RATHER SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN RECYCLE -- FACILITIES TO TAKE CARE OF THIS -- THIS PLASTIC MATERIAL AND DEAL WITH IT IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY AND OF COURSE THAT'S A BUDGET ISSUE AND WILL HAVE TO BE DEALING WITH THAT -- IN THE BUDGET AS WE HAVE MONEY TO DO SO BUT SORT OF AN UNUSUAL POSITION FOR ME BUT I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. AND I'M I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE AUTHOR TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAS ANY. DEFECTS DEFICIENCIES ARE IMPERFECTIONS THAT TO HE WILL WORK VERY VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE TAKEN CARE OF THANK YOU CENTER ROTH. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER ALLEN YOU MAY CLOSE. MEMBERS I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE DISCUSSION I I WILL SAY -- PART OF THE REASON WHY YOUR CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE CALLING ON US TO TAKE ACTION IN THIS AREA IS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A BUDGET BUSTER ON THEIR HANDS. I THEIR ABILITY -- TO TO TO THRIVE AND AND HANDLE THE WASTE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE -- IS BEING VERY SERIOUSLY CALLED INTO QUESTION REVENUE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO COUNT ON JUST TWO YEARS AGO -- IS NOW SUDDENLY GONE AND SO THAT'S ONE REASON WHY WE'RE HEARING AN OUTPOURING OF OF CONCERN AND OVER THE SITUATION IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. FROM OUR FRIENDS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS THAT ARE IMPACTING THEM -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY -- AND TALKING TO FOLKS THE MINISTRATION I THINK THAT. AYE AYES IS MOVES FORWARD -- THE THE FOLKS THE MINISTRATION IF THIS IS IF THIS IS SIGNED INTO LAW IT WILL BE BECAUSE THE FOLKS THE MINISTRATION WILL HAVE REALLY TAKEN OWNERSHIP. OVER THIS CHALLENGE AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THEY'VE BEEN HANDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY ACT ON THIS ON THIS ENORMOUS INFRASTRUCTURAL CRISIS THAT WE HAVE. WITH REGARDS TO WASTE MANAGEMENT SO -- I CERTAINLY STAND OPEN TO WORKING WITH EVERY MEMBER OF THIS OF THIS SENATE BODY TO CONTINUE TO HOLD THE BILL AND WORKED THROUGH THE THE DETAILS -- IT IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S TRYING TO ADDRESS A BROAD PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE -- BUT I THINK THAT THE THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM REALLY DOES MERIT -- BOLD ACTION -- BUT SENSIBLE CAREFUL ACTION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT NIGHT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE. AND STAND -- LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY -- TO TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THIS BILL IS A MUST FOR IT IF IT GETS OUT OF THE HOUSE TODAY.

TWENTY TWO SENATOR JACKSON MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL ONE EIGHTY TWO BY SENATOR JACKSON AND ACT REALLY INTO LOCAL GOVERNMENT CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES -- THIS IS AN ITEM SB ONE EIGHTY TWO WHICH REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD IN THE COMPLEX AND CRUCIAL AREA OF LAND USE. AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANNING. IN AREAS OF THE STATE. AT RISK OF MAJOR. WILDFIRE. COLLEAGUES WE KNOW THAT THE IMPACTS FROM CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ARE MANY. AND WE KNOW THE TASK OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS FROM FUTURE IMPACTS IS SERIOUS. AND MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE. SO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE STRENGTHENED OUR ALERTING CAPABILITY WE HAVE AUTHORIZED NEW PROGRAMS FOR VEGETATIVE FUEL TREATMENT. AND WE HAVE WORKED ON HOME HARDENING AND RETROFITS. WHAT A CRITICAL GAP REMAINS TO PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS THE LEVEL OF SAFETY? NECESSARY TO PROTECT AGAINST FUTURE FIRE RISK. DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE LOST OVER A HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS. TO THESE WILDFIRES AND IN MY DISTRICT THE SUBSEQUENT DEBRIS FLOW KILLED ANOTHER TWENTY THREE PEOPLE AND THIS PAST YEAR WE HAD THE CAMPFIRE WERE EIGHTY EIGHT PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES AND PRIOR TO THAT. WE HAD THE FIRES UP IN SANTA ROSA AND IN THE NORTH COAST WE LIVE IN A VERY PERILOUS TIME. DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING IN AREAS OF HIGH FILE YOUR RISK. SO WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN TO TRY TO WOULD DRESS AGAINST FUTURE FIRE RISK. AND THE GAP. THAT WAS. CLEAR AND IS CLEAR IN THE AREA OF LAND USE AND COMMUNITY PLANNING IS WHAT THIS BILL. SEEKS TO ADDRESS IN THE GAP IT'S SEEKS TO CLOSE TODAY PUT SIMPLY. THIS BILL DIRECTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO FULLY UPDATE IN COORDINATOR LOCAL PLANS FOR FIRE PREPARATION IN RESPONSE PLANNING. AND IT SETS FORTH OUR BEST STANDARDS FOR COMMUNITY DESIGN. EMERGENCY PERSONNEL STAFFING SUFFICIENT INGRESS AND EGRESS. ROUTES OF EVACUATION WHICH WE KNOW IN THE INSTANCE OF THE CAMPFIRE WERE WHOLLY INADEQUATE. WE NEED TO DO THAT WE NEED TO DO UP PAY ATTENTION TO FIRE FLOW HOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE COMMUNITY FIRE BREAKS. AND HOME HARDENING FOR ALL NEW DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS IN DESIGNATED VERY HIGH FIRE. SEVERITY JONES. THIS BILL IDENTIFIES STANDARDS. BY WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO IDENTIFY TO START ACHIEVING THOSE RESULTS TODAY. AND IT AUTHORIZES THE OFFICE OF STATEFIRE MARSHAL TO DEVELOP. BASED UPON BEST SCIENCE. STATE WIDE STANDARD SPECIFIC FOR CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE FIRE ECOLOGY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE NEEDS. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A UNIQUE COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP AMONG LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RURAL AND URBAN ALIKE. ARE PLANNING COMMUNITY OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMMUNITY AND EVEN CONSULTATION WITH OUR HOME BUILDERS. ALL OF THESE PARTIES MENTIONED HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE BILL WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY. AND I MIGHT MENTION. IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S COMPLEX ENOUGH BRINGING THESE PEOPLE TO THE TABLE PEOPLE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS WANT TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. AS A RESULT OF WORKING HARD TOGETHER. LAST FRIDAY I INTRODUCED SIXTY TWO AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL THAT WERE AGREED UPON BY THESE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO KEEP THIS DISCUSSION GOING. AND EVEN OUR HOME BUILDERS WHO HAD OBJECTED INITIALLY TO SOME OF THE STANDARD TO REQUIREMENTS HAVE NOW CALLED FOR US TO CONTINUE MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND I SHOULD NOTE THERE REMAINS A CONCERN ABOUT PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT ADDRESSED THE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES WERE A COMMUNITY IS CONSIDERING DEVELOPING. IN A VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREA IN ORDER TO MEET ITS LOCAL PLANNING GOALS AND STATE HOUSING TARGETS. BUT FINDS BUILDING IN THAT AREA MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO THE STANDARDS WE WOULD REQUIRE UNDER THIS BILL IN ORDER TO ASSURE AS MUCH AS OSSIBLE THE SAFETY IN THE SECURITY OF THOSE PEOPLE. SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THOSE PROVISIONS STONE OBVIATES IMPORTANT STATE GOALS FOR HOUSING I HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS IN POLICY COMMITTEE. THAT ARE SURE THERE WILL BE NO NET LOSS ALL OF HOUSING FOR ANY REGION. INCORPORATING BY REFERENCE AN IMPORTANT STANDARDS SET FORTH IN LEGISLATION BY THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BERKELEY. I'VE WORKED WITH OUR HOUSING COMMITTEE TO INSTITUTE A MULTI STEP PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ANY ADJUSTMENTS IN HOUSING ALLOCATE ALLOCATIONS ARE DONE WITH SAFEGUARDS IN SAFETY IN PLACE. I HAVE TAKEN AND I APPRECIATE AS I MENTIONED MANY OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE REQUIRED BY THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. REQUIRED BY THE LOCAL PLANNING PEOPLE REQUIRED BY THE RURAL AREAS REQUIRED BY THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO WERE AT THE TABLE HERE. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESS IN PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES FROM THE SCOURGES OF WILDFIRES THAT ARE. PERMEATING OUR STATE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT I WILL CONTINUE ADDRESSING GOING FORWARD TO AND I PLEDGE TO DO THAT. BUT HAVING CHAIRED THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FOUR FOUR OF THE LAST SIX YEARS. AND IS SERVING AS VICE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE I AM ACUTELY AWARE. OF THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING IN WILDFIRES OWNS AND AS SOMEONE WHO'S COMMUNITY SUFFERED FOR FORTY DAYS AND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRES OF THE THOMAS FIRE. A YEAR AGO IN DECEMBER. I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHAT THOSE DANGERS CAN MEAN AND ITS IMPACT ON THE PSYCHE OF A COMMUNITY AND SO I WOULD ASK RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AS WE BRING TOGETHER THIS GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRES GOING FORWARD WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIFLE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING. THIRD A WINNER I AM QUITE SORRY PLEASE PROCEED. FIVE I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I COLLEAGUES I MUST RESPECTFULLY RISE -- IN OPPOSITION -- TO THIS BILL -- TODAY -- THIS BILL DID -- THERE A LOT OF IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS BILL -- AND BUT I'M FOCUSED ON WINE WHICH IS WHAT WE FOCUSED ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. OF WHICH WAS THE ASPECT OF THE BILL THAT POTENTIALLY ALLOWS CITIES TO REDUCE THEIR RINA -- OBLIGATION OTHER HOUSING OBLIGATION -- BASED ON HAVING SOME WILD FIRE RISK IN THE CITY. HI THE AUTHOR AND I WE WORKED -- BEFORE THE HOUSING COMMITTEE HEARING TO TRY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WHILE WE WANT TO REDUCE DEVELOPMENT PRESSURE IN AREAS AT HIGH RISK OF WILDFIRE -- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT -- THAT CITIES NOT PUSH THEIR HOUSING OBLIGATIONS INTO OTHER CITIES -- AND THAT IS A REAL ISSUE THAT WE SEE TODAY AND WE DON'T WANT TO EXACERBATE DOT. WE WERE UNABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT BY THE TIME OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE SO THE AUTHOR AND I IN HOUSING COMMITTEE PUT INTENT PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE AND AND AGREED TO KEEP WORKING ON THE ISSUE. WE DID THAT IN EARNEST AND THE AUTHOR AND I HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS THAT OUR STAFF WORK TOGETHER -- AND WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT. I AMENDMENTS -- THE AUTHOR CROSSED AMENDMENTS LAST FRIDAY WE DID NOT SEE THOSE AMENDMENTS UNTIL AFTER THEY WERE CROSSED -- DIED DO NOT FULLY REFLECT THE AGREEMENT -- WITH THE COMMITTEE -- IN ADDITION THE AMENDMENTS ARE INTERNALLY -- CONTRADICTORY AND MY CONCERN WITH THE BILL AS IT STANDS NOW. IS IT PROVIDES THAT IF IF THE IF THE CITY HAS HI WILD FIRE RISK AREAS IN THAT CITY. AND IF THE PERCENTAGE OF LAND IN THE HIGH RISK ZONE IS ABOVE THE AVERAGE FOR THE ENTIRE REGION OR THE COG -- THE NIGHT CITY IS ELIGIBLE FOR A REDUCTION IN ITS RINA AND THAT RENO WILL THEN GET SHIFTED TO OTHER CITIES WITHIN THE COG. WELL IF YOU ARE A CITY LET'S SAY THE AVERAGE IN THE COG IS 10% IN A HIGH WILD VIRUS OWNS A NOT PARTICULARLY HIGH. AND YOU'RE A CITY THAT HAS 12%. YOUR THAN ELIGIBLE FOR REDUCTION EVEN THOUGH 88% OF YOUR LANDS. IS NOT AT HI WILD FIRE RISK. AND NOW WILL THEN GET DISTRIBUTED TO OTHER CITIES A RAISES SIGNIFICANT EQUITY ISSUES -- AND I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE PATH OF THIS BILL I HAD HOPED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE BILL REFLECTS OUR WHAT WE AGREED -- TO AND IF THIS BILL MAKES IT OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY AND IF IT COMES BACK -- IF THESE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED -- I WILL OF COURSE RESERVE MY RIGHT -- TO PULL THE BILL BACK INTO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE BUT I WILL BE VOTING NO TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER SENATOR DODD. THE PRESIDENT MEMBERS -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT -- TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO I UNDERSTAND. THAT SO IMPORTANT ISSUE HOUSING IS A BIG ISSUE HERE BUT LAND USE PLANNING. IN OUR WHILE FIRE AREAS -- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE TODAY WHEN YOU STOP AND THINK. HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS -- YOU OFFER PEOPLE -- THE THE OTHER WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT ISSUES ABOUT PEOPLE LOSING THEIR INSURANCE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT RATES OF UTILITIES GOING UP. AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOOD -- A GOOD BILL THAT SETS. FOR US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF TRYING TO LOOK AT LAND USE PLANNING PARTICULARLY IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. AREAS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT -- FOR PREVENTING THESE WERE -- WILDFIRES IT'S SO -- WELL -- WE CONTINUE. TO WORK ON THESE TYPE ISSUES I THINK IT BE IRRESPONSIBLE NOT TO MOVE THIS THING ALONG TODAY THIS BILL ALONG. TODAY AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB. ONE EIGHT TWO THANK YOU SENATOR DODD SENATOR GALGIANI. I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE AND WHILE I DON'T HAVE WILD FIRE RISK AREAS IN MY DISTRICT I DO HAVE -- AREAS THAT ARE FLOOD PRONE AND HISTORICALLY WE HAVE HAD FLOODS AND WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES IN WHO'VE LOST EVERYTHING THAT THEY OWN -- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY WE DOUBT WITHOUT WITH LEGISLATION WITH SB FIVE BY SENATOR MACHADO. AND IT WAS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION TO HAVE TO TELL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE. SOME BOUNDARY SAID AROUND WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO ALLOW FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND IT WAS ALSO VERY DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE WITH SEVEN THAT LANDOWNERS WHO. HAD GONE THROUGH PURCHASING PROPERTY GOING THROUGH. A PRMITTING PROCESSES AND SO FORTH BUT THERE HAVE TO BE BOUNDARIES I WILL TELL YOU THAT IN TWO THOUSAND IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN I WERE FOR SENATOR PAT JOHNSTON WE HAD THE FLOODING WHERE PEOPLE DID LOSE EVERYTHING. WITHIN A YEAR THAT WHOLE AREA WE SAW HOW HOUSES AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS GOING UP BECAUSE THERE WERE NO BOUNDARIES IN PLACE. FAST FORWARD TO TWO YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD THE THE SAFETY VALVE IT THE OROVILLE DAM THAT HAD ISSUES AND WE HAD SOME FLOODING. WE HAD FLOODING IN MY DISTRICT ANOTHER LEVEE BREAK AND ONCE AGAIN THE PROPERTY THAT WAS INITIALLY UNDER WATER WAS UNDER WATER AGAIN AND PEOPLE WERE BEING EVACUATED AND IT AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY HAD BOUGHT A HOME AND A FLOOD PRONE AREA. CELL AYE I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME ISSUES THAT STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT I THINK THAT THE AUTHORS TAKEN ON A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND I THANK HER FOR FOR TAKING IT ON AND BEING WILLING TO WORK ON IT. THE CENTER GALGIANI MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. THEIR CHECKS WHICH LED TO CLOSE IT'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM PRESIDENT THIS IS A VERY VERY. IMPORTANT ISSUE YOU KNOW THE NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT IS THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF ITS PEOPLE. AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE DO BUILD WE BUILD IN WAY IN IN MANNERS AND WHICH WE ARE. KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW. ABLE TO PROTECT OUR OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT. IT IS AS I MENTIONED IN IMPORTANT COLLABORATION AMONG PARTIES THE DON'T ALWAYS GET ALONG. BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR SAFETY. WE HAVE SAT DOWN AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO TRY TO COME TO CONSENSUS. ISN'T PERFECT WILL IT BE PERFECT. PROBABLY NOT BUT IT IS NECESSARY THAT WE TAKE THE STEPS AND ALTHOUGH I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE CATEGORIZATIONS BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE WE MUST WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN AS WAS POINTED OUT BY AN NPR STORY THIS MORNING. THERE ARE SOME PLACES FRANKLY SIMPLY WHERE WE CHOSE SHOULD NOT BE BUILDING. AND WE SHOULD NOT BE REBUILDING. AND I KNOW THE TENDENCY IN THE YOU'RE JUST FOR PEOPLE TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AND REBUILD IN THE SAME LOCATION AND IN THE SAME WAY. BUT THEN WE SUFFER THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF ADDITIONAL FIRES AND FLOODS IN THE KINDS OF NATURAL DISASTERS THE TAKE THE LIVES OF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THIS STATE WE CANNOT. ACCEPT THAT WE CANNOT STAND BY AS THAT HAPPENS AND SO -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM ABLE TO CONTINUE. WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS -- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE TO THAT WE FIND THAT SWEET SPOT IF YOU WILL WHERE EVERYONE CAN COME TOGETHER -- OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE PLANNERS OR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS THE BILL'S SUPPORTERS THE RC RC WHICH IS THE SPONSOR THIS BILL WE'VE GOT TO KEEP EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE AND IN AGREEMENT. IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING -- BALANCE. AND I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING WITH THAT AND WOULD ASK YOUR SUPPORT IN ORDER FOR THAT TO BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

SENATE BILL FIVE BY SENATOR BILL AN ACT RELATING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE SENATOR BELL. MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS AFFECTS EVERY CITY IN CALIFORNIA. NOW THIS WAS NOT CREATED OVERNIGHT AND IT WON'T BE SOLVED OVERNIGHT. BUT WE CANNOT WAIT WE HAVE TO START CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CALIFORNIA HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE THE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND NECESSARY NEW HOUSING UNITS PER YEAR. AS A RESULT. NEARLY A HUNDRED THIRTY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN LIVED ON OUR STREETS LAST YEAR AND ANOTHER TWO POINT TWO MILLION EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND VERY LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS. ARE NOW CMPETING FOR ONLY SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES. THIS LEAVES MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OF CALIFORNIA'S LOS INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO HOUSING. AND OUT AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. SO SB FIVE CREATES A LOCAL AND STATE MARTIN PARTNERSHIP. TO TACKLE THE CRISIS PROVIDES IMMEDIATE ONGOING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE BILL CREATES UP TO A HUNDRED A A A THE BILL CREATES UP. TO EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NEW AND REHABILITATED HOUSING UNITS. HELPFUL ILLEGALLY POVERTY CREATE JOBS. AND MEETS OUR STATE MARRED ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WITHOUT AFFECTING SCHOOL FUNDING. ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO BUILD SHELTERS. AND SHORT TERM HOUSING IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION BUT IT'S AN EFFICIENT WITHOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. SB FIVE ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COLLABORATE ON A STATE APPROVED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH WILL BE FUNDED BY REDUCING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LOCAL EDUCATION REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUN. THE EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR VERY LOW LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES AS WELL AS TRANSIT NOR IT PRIORITY PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND REVITALIZATION OF NEIGHBORHOOD PROJECTS OR PRIVATIZE. STATE GENERAL FUNDS WILL BE USED TO BACK FILL SCHOOLS. THE LEGISLATURE CAN SUSPEND NEW PLANS DURING THE FISCAL DOWN TURN. AND THE BILL ALIGNS WITH OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS IT REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE LOCAL CONTRIBUTION. AND A LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. THE LEGISLATION. CONTAINS STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS TO ENSURE FUNDS ARE ONLY SPENT ON DESIGNATED PROJECTS. AND TO PROTECT SCHOOL FUNDING. THE BILL CREATES A STATE COMMITTEE. HOUSED UNDER EACH C. D.. TO REVIEW AND APPROVE PROPOSED PLANS PROVIDING STRONG STATE OVERSIGHT. THE COMMITTEE IS ALSO ONE POWER TO TAKE CORRECTION ACTION AND LOCALS DO NOT MEET THEIR PLANNED OBJECTIVES. SB FIVE TO SUPPORT BY A BROAD COALITION OF BUSINESS. LABOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT HOUSING ADVOCATES AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. WE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB. FIVE THANK YOU CENTER BELL CENTRE RAW. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES IS MADE BY MAYBE SETTING A RECORD TODAY IN TERMS OF STANDING UP BUT I WANT TO STAND UP TO INDICATE THAT I AM -- CLEARLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILLS. MY SENATOR GOOD SENATOR. FROM SAN JOSE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY -- IS A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE STATE I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT. AND IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE I'M FROM. THE AREA MADE ITS MARK IN THE STATE AS A CENTER FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE WHERE THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A HOUSE. IS WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS HARDLY. AFFORDABLE. THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR ON GOING AND SUSTAINABLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THAT'S JUST WHAT THIS BILL DOES FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO REMEMBER THE ABUSES OF SOME REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. AND WE HAD A FEW IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN THE DAY. THIS BILL SENATE BILL FIVE CONTAINS STRONG. ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS TO ENSURE THE FUNDS ARE ONLY SPENT. ON APPROVED IN DESIGNATED PROJECTS SO I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I AM SO PLEASED TO STAND TO SUPPORT SB FIVE I WANT TO COMMEND. MY COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MY OTHER COLLEAGUES FROM WAY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- ON THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE -- AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW BACK IN -- TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS I MADE WHEN I OPPOSE THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT. WAS. HOW DO YOU TAKE AWAY THE STATE DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHOUT HAVING A REPLACEMENT -- YOU KNOW AND HERE WE ARE IN -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MOVING FORWARD A VERY VERY POSITIVE I OFFERED TO CREATE THAT DEDICATED REP. REVENUE SOURCE THIS -- IF SP FIVE PASSES -- IT WON'T BE PERSPECTIVE IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION. COMMUNITIES WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT MONEY -- MUCH SOONER THAN THEY WOULD UNDER OTHER -- PROPOSALS THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO HELP CREATE A FUNDING SOURCE TO BUILD THOSE DESPERATELY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS -- YOU KNOW I'M JUST PLEASED TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR AND A VERY EXCITED THAT THIS IS MOVING FORWARD -- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PURSES THE ACTION WE TOOK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I THINK CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF HAD WE KEPT THAT THE FUNDING SOURCE IN PLACE. I AM PLEASED TO SEE THIS MOVING FORWARD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB [inaudible] FIVE THANK YOU. SENATOR FOR IT. NELSON ARE YOU SPEAKING ON THIS THAT SENTINELS. PRESENT LATE IN JAIL THE SENATE I ALSO ORIGIN I VOTE I'VE HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. HE'S BEEN A CHAMPION FOR THIS HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. SOME OF THESE HOUSING BILLS I HAD NOT SUPPORTED BUT THIS ONE I CERTAINLY WILL. AND I DO APPRECIATE THERE'S A SET ASIDE FOR THE RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S IN SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY'S OUT IN THE DESERT. THAT ARE REALLY SUFFERING THEMSELVES. THERE'S SOMETIMES JUST THOUGHT THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS IS ALL BIGGER BUT IT IS NOT. AND THIS WILL BE HELPFUL TO ALL. I THEREFORE URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- I'D LIKE TO COMMEND -- THE THE AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. I HAD -- THE SOMETIMES UNFORTUNATE. OBLIGATION OF SERVING -- ON THE ALREADY A AND THE SUCCESSOR RDA -- IN THE VALLEY. AND I KNOW THAT THE RDA HAD THE SOME CHALLENGES AND I THINK -- NOT EVERYTHING WAS DONE -- TO THE BEST OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS USE. BUT I THINK THAT -- IT SERVES A VERY IMPORTANT PURPOSE ESPECIALLY IN THE VALLEY WHERE WE DON'T HAVE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES AND WE'RE ALWAYS STRUGGLING TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN -- TALENT AND ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT THIS IS A VERY HELPFUL TOOL. FOR LOCAL ENTITIES TO BE ABLE TO STIMULATE OPPORTUNITY. AND I THINK THAT -- THIS AND OTHERS -- OTHER COMPONENTS OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS -- OR MERITORIOUS AS LONG AS OUR FISCALLY PRUDENT AND INVESTED -- WITH -- WITH WISDOM SO -- I'D BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT -- TO SB FIVE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER STERN. THE FAMOUS PRESIDENT ARIZA PROUD JOINT AUTHORED IN STRONG SUPPORT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE OTHER KEY ELEMENT OF THIS BILL FOR ANYONE WHO MAY BE STILL CONSIDERING THEIR VOTE -- THIS NOT ONLY ADDRESSES THE HOUSING CRISIS. BUT ALSO THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT'S THREATENING THE RESILIENCY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AN IMPORTANT AMENDMENT WAS MADE -- TO THIS FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS INVESTMENTS -- IMPORTANT PROJECTS DEALING WITH SEA LEVEL RISE WITH WILD FIRE RISK -- WE NEED FINANCING TOOLS TO DEAL WITH HARDENING OUR HOMES AND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK SB FIVE IT'S GONNA BE A CRITICAL PIECE IN THAT FRAMEWORK THAT IS STILL FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. BUT PUTS US FOR NOT JUST ON THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS AS WELL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I'VE CINNABAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK TODAY. WHEN I TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU? TO THE SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE -- FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND COLLABORATION ON SENATE BILL. FIVE I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE IN THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO ONE HEARINGS WE'VE HAD OVER THE PAST MANY MONTHS AND WE ARE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT THIS STATE NEEDS TO PARTNER I NEED TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP A PERMANENT REVENUE SOURCE TO HELP BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE TALK ABOUT DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THE CRISIS IMPACTS THE WORKING POOR. AND THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS THE MOST. WE HAVE A DESPERATE NEED FOR ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AFFORDABLE UNITS BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN FACT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SURPLUS OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MARKET RATE RENTALS IN THAT SAME TIME PERIOD. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT ALL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE FROM LOS ANGELES TO LAKE COUNTY NEED TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SB FIVE ALSO FOCUSES ON RURAL COMMUNITIES AND SETS ASIDE A PORTION. TO ENSURE RURAL COMMUNITIES CAN ADDRESS THE CRISIS. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONSULT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL TO KEEP PUBLIC SCHOOL FUNDING HOLE. THIS BILL IS NOW SUBJECT TO LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON. WHEN OF FINDING CRISIS LIKE THE RECESSION HIT? AARON WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE FOCUSING ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND ESTABLISHING AN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THE PROJECTS. HAVE THE MUSTARD TO BE ABLE TO HOUSE WORKING FAMILIES AND SENIORS THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT SB FIVE PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE ONGOING REVENUE SOURCE THE BILL THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT IT DOES SO IN THE MOST RESPONSIBLE MANNER AND AGAIN I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU. FOR THE GOOD CENTER FROM SAN JOSE FOR ALL HIS WORK. RESPECTFULLY ASK [inaudible] FOR NINE THANK YOU [inaudible] CENTERS THERE'RE. A MORALE. YES QUESTION THE AUTHOR PLEASE. QUESTION OF THE HONOR ROLL YOU TO QUESTION. YES SIR. YEAH I JUST I READ IN THE BILL -- REAL QUICK LIKE HOW ON HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS HOMES HOW MANY HOMES ARE WE REALLY GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS NUMBER. ONE ALSO IN TRANSIT -- WHAT -- WHAT -- WHAT ARE WE GONNA PRODUCE HOW MANY RAIL LINES? HOW MANY PEOPLE OR IS IT GONNA MOVE PER YEAR PER MONTH? ON THE HAVE ANY -- EMPIRICAL DATA ON THAT AS WELL AS THE LAST THING -- TO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP CLIMATE CHANGE IF YOU COULD WALK ME THROUGH THE OUT HOW MUCH SO ANOTHER WORDS HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BE ALLOTTED FOR TRANSIT IN AND HOW MANY HOMES -- WHAT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF FOUR AND IF YOU GIVE ME NUMBER ON HOW MANY HOMES HOW MANY WERE ALL CARS HOW MANY BUSES. AND THE SPECIFICS ON CLIMATE CHANGE I WOULD BE. GREAT FOR AN APPRECIATIVE. OF THAT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVENTEEN OF THE BILL. WANT TO GETDOWN TO IT -- PAY -- SEVENTEEN SECTION BE NUMBER TWO AND THREE IT SAYS -- FOR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SIX THE COMMITTEE MAY APPROVE. NO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING EACH YEAR. FOR A PARTICULAR PROJECTS IN A THE NEXT -- FIVE YEARS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR [inaudible] SO. IT'S A KIM OF ADDITION. SO EVERY YEAR THERE'D BE AN ALLOCATION PROCESS THERE BE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE SUBMITTED TO THIS COMMITTEE BY. CITY GOVERNMENTS YEAH AND THEY WOULD -- THEY WOULD -- SUBMIT THOSE PROJECTS HALF THE MONEY WOULD HAVE TO BE SPENT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A REQUIREMENT. BUT WE BELIEVE IN IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL. OUTPUT OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT WILL BE -- AS MUCH AS 6570% OF THE FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING HELLO MY I CAN I THINK SO SIR IF THAT SOUL -- WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS COULD BE CREATED BY THIS BILL. OKAY BUT OKAY THAT THAT'S SORT OF THE NUMBERS I'M LOOKING FOR BUT YOU DON'T ANSWER YOU HAVE N. WALK THROUGH LIKE. PER YEAR BECAUSE THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY THE TAXPAYERS ARE PANTS SO I I GUESS HE YOU KNOW IF I WAS AN INVESTOR IN THIS WHICH I GUESS YOU COULD SAY. THE TAXPAYERS ARE -- IT BE NICE KNOW HOW MANY HOMES AT LEAST ANOTHER WORDS HIS SOMEONE ACTUALLY FIGURED OUT HOW MUCH THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO PRODUCE PER YEAR I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SO MUCH FUNDS LLOCATED BUT ARE THERE ANY. YOU KNOW AGAIN EMPIRICAL DATA THAT SOMEONE SAT DOWN AND SAID WE THINK WE CAN GET YOU KNOW THIRTY TWO HOMES A YEAR TRANSIT. AND AND THAT SORT OF THING BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT I HAVE WE HAVE YES SIR WE HAVE A WE HAVE A AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS ON THE BILL. AND THAT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WAS DONE. IT SHOWED THAT THE BILL WILL PROVIDE EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS. AND TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN LOCAL AND STATE -- TAXES AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DUE TO THIS BILL. HOW CAN IN THE LAST QUESTION ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE? COULD YOU HELP ME WALK THROUGH -- THE SPECIFICS ON HOW IT'S GONNA -- I GET HOW MUCH MONEY'S GOING TO GO TOWARDS CLIMATE CHANGE BUT THE SPECIFICS WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORSE THAT MONEY GOING TO GO AND HOW'S IT GOING TO HELP CLIMATE CHANGE [inaudible] WELL. SENATOR WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS BILL IS IT REQUIRES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO THIS COMMITTEE. THAT'S APPOINTED BY US THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR WE HAVE SEATS THAT WE APPOINT. TO A COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE WILL REVIEW THE PLANS THE THE BILL SPECIFIES THAT -- 50% OF THE USE OF THE FUNDS HAS TO BE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ALTHOUGH WE THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE 70%. SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE THEY CAN ALSO SPEND IT ON CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDES. NEARLY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO PROTECT -- FROM FLOODING AND THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE SO IT BE OF FURTHER AREAS ALONG THE COAST. THE BAYS -- THOSE KINDS OF AREAS THAT HAVE OF POTENTIAL -- SEA LEVEL RISE IN CAUSING THEM WITH -- CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS THOSE AREAS COULD HELP -- THIS BILL WILL HELP THOSE AREAS FINANCE. IT I DON'T BELIEVE PERSONALLY THAT -- THE BILL WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH ALL THE MONEY THEY NEED IT WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH SOME MONEY. AND IT WILL PROVIDE THEM ABILITY TO DO THE PLANNING AND START OF CONSTRUCTION FOR THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS. THANKS FOR YOUR ANSWER. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SADDAM. I ENJOYED THE HEARINGS WITH THE SENATORS FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND SONOMA COUNTY. I JUST WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TAKE. TWO AND WE'RE GONNA BE USING INCREMENTAL TAX REVENUES. WE'RE GONNA GO FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SCHOOL FUNDING IS PROTECTED. NO IMMINENT DOMAIN OPPORTUNITIES THERE'S MORE OVERSIGHT WITH WHICH IS THE IT ESTABLISHES A COMMITTEE. YOU CAN. BORROW AGAINST THE REVENUE STREAM. BUT I I I'M TRYING. TO TRY TO CLEAN OUT OF ALL THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT IS DIFFERENT IF YOU SET THIS UP AS OPPOSED TO NOT SETTING IT UP BECAUSE THEN YOU WOULD ELIMINATE A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THEN YOU'D STILL GET TAX IN CRIMINAL REVENUES IN YOU CAN STILL BORROW AGAINST IT AS A CITY COUNCIL. SO I'M KIND OF TRYING. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE NEED FOR THIS BILL WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION THAT. WHAT WHAT'S THE SECRET SAUCE WITH HIM BECAUSE OF CITY CAN DO? THIS ALL WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH A A FORMAL. PROCESS AS RECOMMENDED BY SB FIVE SO I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF IT WALKS LIKE A DUCK IN IT. SOUNDS LIKE A DUCK YOUR RECOVERY BACK TO R. D. A.'S OR ARE WE REALLY GETTING [inaudible] SOMETHING THAT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU DID NOTHING AT ALL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM CENA. SANTA NINE CENTER BILL WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE. I KNOW WHAT REDEVELOPMENT IS. AND THIS AND REDEVELOPMENT. THIS IS COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT. PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING INSTEAD OF HAVING AS REDEVELOPMENT DID. JUST A 20% SET ASIDE THIS REQUIRES 50% MINIMUM OF THE FUNDS TO BE SPENT. NOT SET ASIDE BUT SPENT AND HAVE A COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SPENDING THE MONEY IMMEDIATELY ON BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THIS THIS PARTICULAR. BILL. IS TAKING OUT OF THE HEARINGS AND CLEANING OUT THE HEARINGS THAT WE HAD. ALL THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OF THE PASS IN TRYING TO CONSTRUCT. FROM THE MISTAKES MADE IN THE PAST. AND THE NEED THAT WE HAVE IN THE FUTURE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A PROPER LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL.

SB FIVE TWO NINE WOULD REQUIRE A LANDLORD. EVICTING THE TENANT. TO HAVE AND STATE THEIR REASON FOR THE EVICTION [inaudible] ONLY IF. THE TENANT IS IN THE TENANT ASSOCIATION. CONSISTING OF THREE OR MORE UNITS. THREE OR MORE UNITS OWNED BY THAT LANDLORD. AND THE ASSOCIATION HAS ADOPTED BY LAWS OR AN OPERATING AGREEMENT [inaudible] BECAUSE NOT JUST BECAUSE BECAUSE MUST BE STATED IN WRITING. AND BE THE DOMINANT MOTIVE FOR THE TERMINATION ARE YOU FICTION. THIS BILL HAS BEEN NARROWED TREMENDOUSLY BY NO LONGER INCLUDING THE RENT WITH HOLDING THE RENT STRIKE [inaudible] COLLEAGUES. WE ALL KNOW RENTERS WE TELL STORIES ALL THE TIME ABOUT RENTER'S FACING AN X.. THREE INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT REALITY IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE NEARLY HALF OF CALIFORNIANS [inaudible] OR RENTER'S. HALF OF CALIFORNIANS ARE RENTERS ACROSS THE BOARD. 44% ARE TRYING TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES. SB FIVE TWO NINE SIX TO EQUALIZE THOSE TEN INVOICES. IN CALIFORNIA HOUSING SHORTAGES HAVE REACHED CRISIS LEVELS. THE ALLOWING OF BOYS FOR THE RENTERS IS CRITICAL. IT EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS TO ACT WITHOUT FEAR NOW WE FIGHT FOR LANGUAGE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR AND WHISTLE BLOWER CASES. THAT AN INDIVIDUAL. SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK UP ON THEIR ISSUES IN THIS CASE. LIVING STANDARDS TO PROTECT THE FAMILY INSTABILITY OF THEIR FAMILIES. THE SAFETY AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE ALL ARE USING THE TERM. PRODUCTION WERE FOR PRODUCING MORE HOUSING PRESERVATION LET'S HOLD ON TO THE HOUSING THAT WE HAVE. BUT PROTECTION IS AS IS AS IMPORTANT BECAUSE PRODUCTION IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS. CENTRAL TO THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS IS TO JOIN TOGETHER. ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT WITHOUT THEM FEELING THAT THEY'RE TAKING THE RISK OF HARM AND RETALIATION. COLLEAGUES I KNOW WE MIGHT EACH HAVE. SOME STORIES ANECDOTAL STORIES OF SOME BAD TENANT OR TEN AND THAT DIDN'T BEHAVE. THAT SHOULD NOT GET IN THE WAY OF PROTECTING TENANTS WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER AS NEIGHBORS TO SAY. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE. WE WANT TO FIX WE WANTED FIXED. COLLEAGUES I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION A BIT ON THE SIDE OF CENTER RUBIO. YES THANK YOU FOR FOR SO I WANNA AT I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS UP I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS BUT YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW. I HOUSING IS AN ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT WE LOOK AT POLICIES LIKE HERS AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS UP IN. AND TAKING SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU KNOW SOME FOLKS HAVE CONCERNS OF I KNOW SOME. PEOPLE ARE STILL CONFUSED ABOUT THE WITH HOLDEN RENT AND SHE MADE A VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S NOT PART OF THIS BILL. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY AGAIN THANK YOU AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS. WE WE WE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE YESTERDAY -- I'M NOT CERTAIN HOW MUCH -- THE SENTIMENTS OF CHANGED. BUT ALL ABBREVIATE WHAT I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE -- MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS ONE STEP REMOVED FROM RENT CONTROL. WHICH THE VOTERS SOUNDLY REJECTED -- AT THE THE VOTING BOOTH -- IN THE REASON FOR THAT IS WHEN YOU. ARE CREATING A TENANT UNION IF YOU WILL OR SO SEE ATION. IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THAT ORGANIZATION IS GOING TO COLLECTIVELY DEMANDS -- A REDUCTION IN RENT. AND THAT IS ONE OF MY WHAT IS ONE OF MY ONE OF MY CONCERNS. AND I THINK I EXPRESS THAT TO YOU BEFORE BUT IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW VOTER INTEGRITY. WE WE'VE ALREADY VOTED IS IS A STATE ON THIS ISSUE RECENTLY. AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS THAT WAS -- REJECTED. BUT PROMOTE ANOTHER POINT WOULD BEING. WE HAVING CREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TENANT PROTECTIONS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE NARRATIVE THAT HAS BEEN PUT OUT THERE IS THAT THERE IS A LIST. OF BAD LANDLORDS AND YES THERE ARE BAD LAND LANDLORDS IN FACT DURING MY TIME ON AT THE CITY OF FRESNO. WE HAD INSTITUTE -- SLUM LORD -- RULES TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE WERE ABIDING BY CALIFORNIA SAFE A HABITATION STANDARDS. ARE AND WE USED ALL THE HEROES IN THE CORNER QUIVER TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. OKAY I GUESS WHAT WHEN I'M SAYING IS THAT THE NEAR THAT'S PUT OUT THERE. IS THAT INDIVIDUALS DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSOCIATE AND THAT'S NOT TRUE. THAT INDIVIDUALS DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEEK RECOURSE WITH THE AUTHORITIES ARE AND THAT'S NOT TRUE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEEK REDRESS IN THE COURTS AND THAT'S NOT TRUE. STORE CREATING THIS THIS NARRATIVE AYE I FRANKLY FIND. INACCURATE. ARMY AND I THINK WHAT THIS GOES TO IS THAT. THE IDEA OF ASSEMBLING INDIVIDUALS INTO A UNION IS NOT FOR SAFE HABITATION. IT IS FOR RENT CONTROL AND THAT'S WHERE THIS IS GOING I FEAR AND THAT'S REASON I RESPECTFULLY -- HAVE TO BE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. SPECIALIST JOURNALIST SENATE. ANY TIME YOU TRY TO RESTRICT SOMETHING. THEN THE PRICE USUALLY WILL GO OUT. THAT'S BEEN PROVEN BY RENT CONTROL MEASURES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND WOULD IT BE THE TENANTS THAT PUT UP THE MONEY. THE BILL THESE UNITS NOW. IT'S SOME KIND OF INVESTOR. AND SOMETIMES THESE AREN'T BIG RICH PEOPLE THERE. THE MOM AND POPS THAT HAVE FOR FIVE TEN UNITS. THE BILL ROPER PERIOD OF TIME MANY FAMILIES. HAVE THAT SIDE ENTERPRISE. IN THIS IS IN FACT. GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. FOR US TO HAVE SECURE HOUSING. FOR THE POPULATION. JUST AN EXAMPLE [inaudible] PARADISE [inaudible] BURNED OUT. WHERE DO ALL THOSE PEOPLE GO? THERE'S NO HOUSING AVAILABLE. AND IN TERMS OF ANYTHING BE IN. FAST TO BUILD I I'M NOT. STILL I OF AN INSEPARABLE OPTIMISTIC WE CAN DO SOMETHING IN CALIFORNIA. EXPEDITE THE PERMITTING PROCESS SEES LOCAL AND STATE. THAT CHAU IMPEDE. AN ADD TO THE COSTS. I REMEMBER AN ADVOCATE OF THE HOMELESS SPEAKING. THE CZECHO TWO YEARS AGO. CONDEMNING WHAT CALIFORNIA HAD DONE TO MAKE HOUSING SO EXPENSIVE. SO EXPENSIVE THAT EVEN THE HOMELESS COULD NOT FIND FACILITIES. THAT WERE BUILT. FOR THEM. BECAUSE THEN WHAT THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WAS A SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ADDED TO THE COST. AND SHE ARGUED HOW MANY MORE. HOMELESS PEOPLE COULD BE HOUSE BUT FOR THE FREE HEARING AWAY. OF THOSE DOLLARS [inaudible] THIS. I I THINK IT'S IT'S A A SOLUTION. CHECKING A PROBLEM. THAT DOESN'T EXIST. I URGE A NO VOTE [inaudible] WIENER GIRL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE AGAIN I'M IN OPPOSITION YESTERDAY AFTER WE HEARD THIS BILL. AND LEGALLY DEBATE THAT WENT BACK AND FORTH IN WE GET EMAILS CALLS TEXT MESSAGES. I'M ON THE UNFAIRNESS A LOT OF THE TIMES BETWEEN THE TENANT AND THE LANDLORD. I SHARED SOME STORIES YESTERDAY WHERE WE HAVE LANDLORDS. THAT -- IT TAKES MONTHS ALMOST TWO YEARS SOMETIMES YEARS TO GET SOMEBODY OUT OF AN APARTMENT. AND THEN WHEN THEY LEAVE I HEARD A STORY YESTERDAY AFTER THIS WAS DEBATED ON THE FLOOR THEY RIPPED OUT THE CABINETS TO THE APPLIANCES. AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE -- TO THE TENANTS THAT DO THESE THINGS SO I UNDERSTAND AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR ABOUT MAKING SURE AND LIKE THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY WERE AT A LADY WOULD LIVED IN APARTMENT. FOR THIRTY YEARS IS IS BEING A TRYING TO BE EVICTED AND AND IT HAD YOU KNOW INTERVIEW MENTION HAD TO TAKE PLACE. SO I GET THAT BUT THE LONG RULES THAT THIS BODY HAS CREATED -- OVER THE LENGTH OF TIME -- OVER THE OF THE LAST DECADE HAS CREATED AN IMPACT OF COST AND FEES WERE 53% OF THE STATE SAYS THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE AND IF YOU TAKE THAT TO MILLENNIALS AT 63%. MOST OF THESE PEOPLE RENT -- HOUSING AND THESE FIVE ORGANIZATIONS OR ASSOCIATIONS THAT ARE TRYING TO BE FORMED. IT'S ALL ABOUT REDUCING THE COST OF HOUSING AND I GET IT BECAUSE HOUSING IS EXPENSIVE. BUT RENT CONTROL WAS VOTED ON LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO SAID OVERWHELMINGLY BY THE VOTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY VOTED TO NOT ALLOW RENT CONTROL TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS. AND SO TO COME UP WITH BILLS THEY HAVE AN END RUN AROUND THAT AND THE ONE THAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE -- TO BLATANTLY JUST REINTRODUCE THAT BILL AND GO AROUND THE VOTERS IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING SO I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR AT LEAST BRINGING UP THE ISSUE -- ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THE HOUSING ISSUE WHEN THAT THE RENTERS THAT NEED A PLACES TO LIVE IN I AGREE IF IT WASN'T SOMEONE AFFORDABLE I THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE PURSUING THE AMERICAN DREAM AND BUYING A HOME AND YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN BILLS THAT WE'VE AUTHORED OR THEY HAVE BEEN. OFF THIS FLOOR THIS WEEK ABOUT ALLOWING YOU KNOW RENTERS CREDITS FOR YOU KNOW ESTABLISHING CREDIT FOR THE RENT PAYMENTS AND I THINK THAT'S PRETTY PHENOMENAL AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE REDUCTION OF COST OF HOUSING. AND WE NEED TO WORK ON GOOD POLICY IN THIS HOUSE THAT GENERATES HOUSING -- FOR ALL OF US AND AND OUR CONSTITUENTS TO LIVE AND SO I WOULD I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. IN ADDITION DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SHE JONES SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- I'LL START OFF BY SAYING THAT -- YOU KNOW CURRENTLY MY WIFE AND I ARE RENTERS AND HAVE BEEN FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS. SO I AM -- PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS BILL. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION THE AUTHOR IF I MAY MISTER PRESIDENT. IN DRUGS ARE YOU TO QUESTION YES. THANK YOU SIR -- I I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE OPERATION OF THE ASSOCIATION. AND SO -- CAN YOU SPEAK TO YOU ON THE FUND RAISING CAPABILITIES OF THIS SOCIALLY HOW WOULD THEY FUNDRAISE. POWER THE YOU KNOW PAY FOR THEIR IF THEY'RE GOING TO HIRE A STAFF MEMBER YOU KNOW TO BE TO OPERATE THE ASSOCIATION -- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS BE BEHIND THAT YOU KNOW POLITICAL ACTION CAN THEY FORM A POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE. AND THEN BECOME POLITICALLY ACTIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY AS AN ASSOCIATION. AND SAUCER WITH THOSE TWO QUESTIONS SO FUND RAISING AND POLITICAL ACTION -- IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY [inaudible] SENATOR. ONE RESPONSE. YES THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS. THE FORMATION THE PARTICULARS THAT TECHNICAL ISSUES. THERE ARE OF RULES THAT. SOME OF THE MMHM GO TO TENANT ASSOCIATIONS BUT THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO CREATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE TENANT ASSOCIATION TEN ASSOCIATIONS GET FORM THEY HAVE THEIR BY LAWS. WE DON'T GET INTO THAT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS A BONAFIDE ASSOCIATION. WE'RE NOT IN THIS LAW MAKING ANY REFERENCE TO HALL WHERE THE HOW IT'S STRUCTURED OR WHAT IT HOW IT. FUNCTIONS THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE PLACE OF THIS BILL THIS BILL IS SIMPLY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF RETALIATION. IN CASE OF A TENANT IN VERY LIMITED VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S NOT. THE BIG YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IT'S A VERY VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCE ONLY HAS TO DO WITH RETALIATION. IF IT'S A TENANT. THAT HAS JOINED AN ASSOCIATION AND AGAIN IT'S VERY SPECIFIC TO THE NUMBER OF UNITS THREE A MORE UNITS OF THE SAME LANDLORD. YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS VERY NARROW BUT IT'S NOT THE PRACTICE THE THE STRUCTURAL -- DOESN'T DICTATE THE STRUCTURAL WAYS INTO AN ERA IN WHICH AN ASSOCIATION IS GOING TO BE. FORMED. THANK YOU I'M ON MY OWN TIME IS FOR THE ON YOUR OWN TIME THANK YOU IN AT I I UNDERSTAND AND I BELIEVE THE AUTHORS SINCERITY IN THIS OP PROPOSAL -- I'VE HEARD HER SPEAK PASSIONATELY -- BOTH IN COMMITTEE IN HERE ON THE FLOOR ON THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES. I JUST BELIEVE THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL -- HAS SOME DEFICIENCIES IN IT DOESN'T SPELL OUT THOSE THAT PROCESS OF HOW. THE TENANTS CAN ORGANIZE. WHAT THE LIMIT OF THEIR ORGANIZATION IS? WHAT OTHER ASSOCIATIONS CAN THEY ASSOCIATE WITH -- THERE AS HAS BEEN STATED ON THE FLOOR THERE'S SOME CONCERNS THAT HE OF UNIONIZING. NO APARTMENT RENTERS I THINK THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN AYE AYE. I WOULD THINK THAT THE THE CURRENT LEGITIMATE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS WOULD HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THIS AS WELL -- IS ESPECIALLY THE POLITICAL ACTION SIDE OF IT. THERE'S NO THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT LIMITS OR ALLOWS OR REGULATES. WHAT THAT IS AND I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF -- AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO WORK OUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU IN ADDITION SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT I VOTED I YESTERDAY ON THIS BILL -- I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING IN THE BILL THAT TALKED ABOUT RENT CONTROL I ALSO DID NOT SEE ANYTHING IN THE BILL ABOUT -- THE TENANTS BEING ABLE TO FORM A UNION ALTHOUGH AS A FORMER UNION LABOR LEADER I LOVE THAT IDEA AND MAYBE WE CAN AMEND THAT INTO THE BILL. WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS? I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ON THIS FLOOR HAVE VISITED SOME OF THESE APARTMENT COMPLEXES WE HAVE BEEN A GREGIS COMPANY. IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY WHO OWNS OVER EIGHT THOUSAND APARTMENT COMPLEXES AND IS PROUD OF THE SLUM LORD CONDITIONS BUT HE PROVIDESAS HE SAYS TO THAT SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. SO THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LOW INCOME POOR PEOPLE AND IF PEOPLE WANT TO ASSOCIATE A GET TOGETHER TO TRY AND BETTER THEMSELVES AND BETTER THEIR WAY OF LIFE. I DON'T SEE THAT AS AN ISSUE WE KIND OF FORMAL LITTLE ASSOCIATION HERE RIGHT WE'RE ALL IN THE STATE SENATE WERE ALL SENATORS I GUESS THAT'S KIND OF AN ASSOCIATION. AS A CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MOBILE HOMES. I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE MOST DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS FOR MOBILE HOME HOME PARK RENTERS. MOST OF THOSE SLUMLORDS LIVE OUT OF STATE SOME OF THEM LIVE OUT OF COUNTRY SO I HEARD ON THE FLOOR YESTERDAY THAT OWNING APARTMENT COMPLEXES BUILDS WEALTH THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT IT'S BUILDING WEALTH FOR SLUMLORDS NOT ALL ARE. BUT THE ONES THAT I VISITED I VISITED A LOT IN MY DISTRICT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYONE'S DISTRICT -- THERE ARE A LOT OF SLUMLORDS OUT THERE THAT ARE% TAKING ADVANTAGE OF POOR PEOPLE AND YOU CAN CHARGE WHAT YOU WANT TO CHARGE. THESE KEEP YOUR PARK UP AT LEAST KEEP YOUR APARTMENT BUILDING UP MAKE SURE THE WATER IS CLEAN MAKE SURE THAT THE TANKS ARE CLEAN MAKE SURE THAT THE SEWAGE. IS AN OVERFLOWING SO. I'VE I FEEL LIKE I'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT THESE WONDERFUL FOLKS THAT ARE JUST TRYING TO RENT TO PEOPLE AND BUILD WEALTH THAT HAS NOT BEEN MY EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN MORE ON THE OPPOSITE END. I WOULD URGE ANYONE WHO DIDN'T VOTE I YESTERDAY TO PLEASE GO UP ON THIS BILL BECAUSE THIS IS JUST ABOUT MAKING SURE THE POOR PEOPLE ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AND AGAIN I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING IN THE BILL. ABOUT RENT CONTROL OR ABOUT FOUR A UNION -- BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT FORMING A UNION IRISH AN AYE VOTE. ANY ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION OF IT ON THIS ITEM. KERN TEEN ON SENATOR ALSO TO LIKE TO CLOSE. YES AGAIN I JUST WANT TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THIS BILL -- IS ABOUT. A VERY NARROW SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE TENANTS WHO ARE NEIGHBORS THESE ARE MEN AND WOMEN THEY'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW HAVE A GOOD STABLE. HOME OR APARTMENT. IF THEY DECIDE TO JOIN THE HOTEL ATTENDANT ASSOCIATION THAT THERE WILL NOT BE RETALIATION THAT THEY'LL BE BECAUSE PROVIDED AS TO WHY THEY'RE BEING THE VICTIM. REMEMBER THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ENDING UP HOMELESS OR INVICTUS. IF YOU COULD GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES WE WOULD HAVE LESS HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY ACROSS CALIFORNIA COLLEAGUES I URGENT ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SENATE BILL SIX FIFTY SIX BUT CENTER HUESO AN ACT RELATING TO THE SAN DIEGO CORONADO BRIDGE INCLUDING THERE'S THREATS TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I HAVE RESIDENTS FLORIDA PERCENT. HUNDREDS OF MEASURES OVER THE YEARS. BUT I'VE I'VE RARELY SEEN. ONE THAT IS SO PERSONAL TO ME AND TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO [inaudible] THIS ISSUE [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY [inaudible] IS THE MORE ON SLIGHTLY SIDE. OF OUR BELOVED AND BEAUTIFUL SEND YOU ARE NOT A BRIDGE -- THIS YEAR THE CORONADO BRIDGE AND I WILL TURN FIFTY YEARS OLD OF IN THE SAME MONTH OF AND IN THOSE YEARS. MANY PEOPLE HAVE USED THIS BRIDGE TO END THEIR LIVES VERY QUIETLY. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WITHOUT. LOTS OF NEW STORIES. CALLING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE IN FACT. ALL RIGHT CURRENTLY IT IS RECOGNIZED. AS THE SECOND MOST FREQUENTLY USED BRIDGE FOR SUICIDES IN ALL OF THE UNITED STATES. WITNESSING IN AS MANY AS NINETEEN DEATHS ANNUALLY. IN RESPONSE THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL IS INCREASE THEIR PRESENCE AND MONITORING. ADDITIONALLY THIS SPRING CALTRANS PLAY SPORTS BIKES ALONG THE EDGES. OF THE BRIDGE [inaudible] HOWEVER. THESE INITIATIVES. ARE ONLY TEMPORARY AND I'M NOT BEEN ABLE TO FULLY ADDRESS. THIS ISSUE WITHIN WEEKS OF THEIR INSTALLATION THREE SUICIDES OCCURRED WITHIN A SINGLE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD. ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ESSENTIAL DUTIES. IS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PUBLIC'S SAFETY. NO WHERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS OUR STATE'S GOVERNMENT FAILING SO GRAVELY. THEN HERE IN THIS ROADWAY IN THE CORNER BRIDGE. EVERYWHERE ELSE SOMETIMES A A DEATH RESULTS IN A LOSS. TO THE LIABILITY. HERE WE ARE FAILING THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE CALTRANS TO ESTABLISH A DEVICE RE COMMITTEE WHICH WILL PROVIDE INPUT ON THE SELECTION OF A PER PROPER SUICIDE DETERRENT SYSTEM. THIS COMMITTEE WOULD BE COMPRISED OF A VARIETY OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM SENDING COUNTY THE CITIES OF CORN OUT OF ONE SAN DIEGO THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND AND LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE PREVENTION ADVOCATES. SB SIX FIVE SIX WILL ENSURE INPUT. PROVIDED BY A BROAD SELECTION OF REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS WILL HELP INFORM THE SELECTION PROCESS AND LEAD TO A DECISION. THAT BEST MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL GETS COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK. AS CO CALTRAIN CONTINUES TO REVIEW POSSIBLE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO HELP PREVENT THESE LAMENTABLE DEATHS. MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. LET'S START. WORKING HARD TO ELIMINATE. THIS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION FACING MY COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT. OF THIS PROPOSAL I THINK THE AUTHOR. FOR THE MANY YEARS THAT HE HAS SPENT WORKING ON THIS -- TRYING TO COME TO A SOLUTION. THAT -- OBVIOUSLY IMPACTS HIS DISTRICT BUT I BELIEVE IT IMPACTS -- NOT JUST HIS DISTRICT BUT ALL FORTY SENATE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. AS HE STATED THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP -- BRIDGES IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS USED FOR SUICIDE. AND THOSE SUICIDES DON'T JUST IMPACT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS GOTTEN TO SUCH A DESPAIR IN THEIR LIFE THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION THEY SEEK IS TO END THEIR OWN LIFE. BUT IT LEAVES BEHIND A RIPPLE EFFECT OF DESPAIR. AMONGST THEIR FAMILIES -- AMONGST THEIR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES. AMONGST THEIR CO WORKERS AND PEOPLE THAT KNEW THAT PERSON AND PERSONALLY. IT LEAVES A RIPPLE EFFECT ON COUNSELORS. THEY HAVE TRIED TO MISTER THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO PREVENT. SUCH AN ACT OF DESPAIR. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SOMETIMES IS OVERLOOKED AND NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. IS EFFECTIVE THE HOUSE OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. AND THIS. SITUATION HAS BECOME PERSONAL TO ME MOST RECENTLY. AS TWO OF MY BEST FRIENDS. THEIR SONS HAVE JUSTRECENTLY BEEN RECRUITED AND OBTAINED A POSITION ON ON THE SAN DIEGO HARBOR POLICE. AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO RESPOND. TO THE SITUATIONS. AND IT'S OUR POLICE OFFICERS OUR FIREFIGHTERS ARE PARAMEDICS. AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS THERE ARE THE FIRST ON THE SCENE. TO THE SITUATIONS [inaudible] THAT -- HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE OF THE OF THE SITUATION TAKE CARE OF THE SCENE. AND THEN AFTER THAT. HAVE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE FAMILY. AND THE FRIENDS. THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND. SO I THINK THIS IS A SMALL STEP. AT THE STATE GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE. TO HELP PREVENT. THOSE TRAGIC SITUATIONS. AND THOSE ACTS OF DESPAIR. AND I THINK THE AUTHOR AGAIN. FOR HIS DILIGENT WORK ON THIS AND ALSO ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF SENATOR BILL. JUST BRIEFLY -- OF SINCE THERE'S BEEN -- SUICIDE BRIDGE JOB. SUICIDE PREVENTION ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THE LAST. TEN YEARS THIS IS NOW. THE THIRD RICH AND UNITED STATES. AND I PLEDGE SIR WERE ALSO FOR HIS EFFORTS -- HE'S BEEN.
