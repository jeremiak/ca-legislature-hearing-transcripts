LEGISLATURE HAS A- TERRIBLE

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:54.459
HABIT. AS DO GOVERNORS. BUT NOT

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.027

DHL REGARDING TAX INCREASES.

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:07.606
AND A TAX INCREASE IN TAX

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.342
INCREASES PEARL OR NOT THE

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:13.345
WAYS. OUT OF OUR FISCAL

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:15.914
DIFFICULTIES TODAY. THERE ARE

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:17.249
SOME THINGS IN THIS BUDGET THAT

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:19.484
ARE DECENT AND CONSIDERATION

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:21.086
BUT NOTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:23.822
SUSTAINING INTO THE FUTURE. NO

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:26.258
WE CAN COUNT ON THAT WILL KEEP

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:29.194
OUR BUDGET SOUND. AND BALLOTS

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.163

PRECARIOUSLY BALANCED THE

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:45.711
CRISIS OF THIS YEAR ONLY OF

00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:47.746
FIRMS THAT OBSERVATION. HOW

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:51.917
QUICKLY IT COULD GO BACK. IT IT

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:53.719
DID NEED TO BE OF THE

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:55.554
SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT WE NOW ARE

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:59.191
SUFFERING. THE OTHER SIGNAL IS

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:03.629
TO THE BUSINESSES OF CALIFORNIA.

00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:06.398
YOU'RE ALREADY TROUBLED. YOU'VE

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:07.366

BUSINESS AGAIN TO OPEN YOUR

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:14.272
DOORS. AND AS EACH DAY PASSES

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:17.476
BY. MANY OF THEM GET CLOSER TO

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:19.378
THE POINT WHERE THEY WILL NOT

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:22.514
OPEN UP AGAIN. AND THERE'S

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:23.915
ALWAYS THE ASSUMPTION ORGAN

CERTAINLY THERE AMPLY TAXED.

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:35.394

ANY BUSINESS OWNER THAT HAS TO

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:06.217

REVENUES- IT'S A FAIR

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:30.014
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:35.019
TOGETHER- DURING GOOD TIMES AND

00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:38.322
IN BAD TIMES- BUT TO DEFERRED

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.291
FOR A FEW YEARS MANGER ASSUMING

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:42.493
THAT THE BUSINESS WILL STILL BE

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:44.128
IN BUSINESS FOR THREE OR MORE

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:46.297
YEARS- THAT'S NOT VERY

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:49.867
COMFORTING. THE THRESHOLD IS

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:50.434
ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.336
REVENUES THAT IS NOT A HIGH

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.872
THRESHOLD THAT. HERE ARE JUST A

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.573
SMALL CPA PRACTICE WITH A

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.409

00:42:58.475 --> 00:42:59.643
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN GROSS

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.278
REVENUES AND FEES AND

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:03.080
BUILDINGS- SO IT'S GOING TO

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:05.916
CAPTURE A GOOD GOOD AMOUNT OF

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:07.651
OUR BUSINESSES HERE IN.

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.720
CALIFORNIA AND THAT THAT IS NOT

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:12.923
A GOOD GESTURE AS WERE TRYING

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.725
TO DIG OUT FROM CORONA VIRUS.

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:15.192
ALSO THE RESEARCH AND

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:17.695
DEVELOPMENT CREDIT- WE SHOULD

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:19.563
BE REAL CAREFUL NOT TO ABUSE

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.765
THAT AND PUT THAT ON SUSPENSE

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:23.634
AS WELL. SO WHAT HAPPENS AND

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:24.768
IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID AND I

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:26.537
WON'T BELABOR THE POINT BUT

00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:27.304
WE'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT

00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:30.341
MIGRATION OUT- IF WE MAKE THE

00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:32.943
CLIMATE. TO HOSPITAL FOR GOOD

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:35.012
BUSINESS PEOPLE- THEY HAVE

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:37.081
OPTIONS AND THEY HAVE BEEN

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:37.881
TAKING THOSE OPTIONS AND WE

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:39.783
ARE. JUST TO HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.885
THE IRS MAILING ADDRESS CHANGES

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:44.455
OF WHO'S MOVED FROM CALIFORNIA

00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:45.889
TO WHAT STATES AND VICE VERSA.

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:47.925
AND SO WE'RE SEEING A MIGRATION

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:50.961
TO STATES LIKE TEXAS AND-

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:53.630
NEVADA AND WE'VE GOT TO SOMEHOW

00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:57.668
MAKE. EFFORTS TO. DECREASE AND

00:43:57.735 --> 00:43:59.670
TURN THAT AROUND. SO MADAM

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:01.372
PRESIDENT IT'S GOING TO BE

00:44:01.438 --> 00:44:04.341
DIFFICULT. BUT IF WE'RE GONNA

00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:04.875
TAX A LITTLE BIT FOR EVERY

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:07.678
TIME. WE'RE NOT MAYBE MAKING

00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:11.882
ENOUGH CUTS. THEN WE DON'T HAVE

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:14.385
FAR TO GO WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT

00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:16.587
THE HIGHEST INCOME TAX RATES.

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:17.321
PROBABLY THE HIGHEST CORPORATE

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:20.457
RATES HIGHEST GAS TAX RATES

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:22.393
HIGHEST SALES TAX RATES WE WERE

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:23.827
IN WITH PROP THIRTEEN

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:25.362
IRONICALLY WERE ACTUALLY ALMOST

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:26.697
AT THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION OF

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:29.400
PROPERTY TAX RATES SO. WE DON'T

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.335
HAVE MUCH MORE ROOM TO PUSH SO

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.170
WITH THAT COLLEAGUES I WOULD

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:36.006
NOT RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON AB

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:37.241
EIGHTY FIVE THANK YOU MADAM

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:38.108

YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I WON'T

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:46.683
BELABOR SOME OF THE POINTS THAT

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.819
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY MADE.

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:52.589
BUT I THINK MY BIGGEST CONCERN

00:44:52.656 --> 00:44:55.859
WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS

00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:58.796
THAT THERE IS A PROCESS PROBLEM.

00:44:58.862 --> 00:45:01.098
IN THE PROCESS PROBLEMS IS. WE

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:04.935
ARE MOVING ON BUDGET ITEMS AND

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.070
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:09.773
OF. IN WHICH WE'RE OPERATING

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.176
WHAT I WILL BE MORE SPECIFIC IF

00:45:12.242 --> 00:45:13.710

AND ANY NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES.

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:21.618
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE

00:45:21.685 --> 00:45:23.787
ASSISTING YOU WOULD NATURALLY

00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:26.457
ASK WHAT IS YOUR REPAYMENT PLAN.

00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:28.592

WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOU'RE

OVERHEAD CUTS THAT ARE GOING TO

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.516
ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD OF

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:27.484

EXPECTED IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:55.112
MANAGE A FIFTY FOUR BILLION

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:59.316

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:00.350
I WILL GET INTO EVERYTHING THAT

00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:02.019

FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:55.005
BECAUSE TO MAKE DECISIONS

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.873

E. AS TO WHERE WE ARE. AS TO

WHAT WE'VE DONE HISTORICALLY

00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:33.443
AND WE'RE CALIFORNIA

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:34.611
CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT YOU GOT MY

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:37.514
ATTENTION. FIRST AND FOREMOST

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.882
IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.550
GDP IN CALIFORNIA JUST LOOKED

00:48:40.617 --> 00:48:42.085
UP WAS ONE POINT FOUR TRILLION

00:48:42.152 --> 00:48:45.088
THANK. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN ONE

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:47.524
POINT NINE TRILLION IN TWO

THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWO POINT

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:49.693
NINE TRILLION AND TODAY. THREE

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.997
POINT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS. SO

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:54.598
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT AT

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:58.635
SOME LEVEL. THE QUESTION.

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.070
NUMBER TWO IS THERE'S NO DOUBT

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:01.438
THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT'S

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:02.739
THIS REVENUE COMES FROM

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:05.142
BUSINESSES NO QUESTION. BUT

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:07.577
THERE IS A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:09.513
IN CALIFORNIA IN A RICH POOR

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:12.449
DIVIDE. WHERE WE HAVE THESE

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:14.318
EXTRAORDINARY NUMBERS AND

00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:15.185
PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:17.054
SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY COMPARED TO

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.555
OTHER GLOBAL ECONOMIES. BUT

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:21.191
THERE'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:23.527
CHALLENGE WE HAVE SOME OF THE

00:49:23.593 --> 00:49:25.295
POOREST FOLKS WHO WERE

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:27.397
CHALLENGE TO THE GREATEST LEVEL

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:29.499
AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.234
COMPANIES THAT ARE THE MOST

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:32.936
DYNAMIC AND THE RICHEST. WHICH

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.538
INFORMS OUR THREE POINT TWO

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:38.508
BILLION DOLLAR GDP. IT SHOWS WE

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:40.577
SIT DOWN AND BE RESPONSIBLE AND

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:42.479
THOUGHTFUL LEADERS WITH RESPECT

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:43.947
TO CRAFTING A BUDGET. THE

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:45.048
QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU DO IT

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:46.950
NOW I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:48.485
NINETY TWO WHEN PETE WILSON CUT

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:49.086
A DEAL WITH JERRY BROWN THAT

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:50.554
WOULD JERRY BROWN WITH PETE

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.057
WITH A- WILLIE BROWN. AND ARE

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:57.594
YOUNGER BROTHER. A END TO THEY

00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:59.730
DID SAY BILL IN CUTS SEVEN IN

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:04.401
INTACT. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:05.168
THE LARGE MARKETS. WE DON'T

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:06.837
KNOW. WHAT WHAT THE FEDERAL

00:50:06.903 --> 00:50:09.406
GONNA DO UNDER. BUT WE DO KNOW

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:10.474
THAT THE STATE CAN. HAS A

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.442
PRETTY HAD A PRETTY HEALTHY.

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:15.679
ETHICS RATE A FUN THAT WAS

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:17.581
SUPPLEMENTED BY RAINY DAY FUND

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:19.182
FOR SOCIAL SPECIAL SIR I MEAN

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:20.817
FOR SAFETY NET SUPPLEMENTED BY

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:23.019
A FURTHER. A SAFETY NET FOR

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:26.423
EDUCATION ALL OF WHICH HELPS

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.158
CREATE A LARGER DYNAMIC. AS WE

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:30.494
MOVE INTO THE NEXT TO FACE

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.262
AFTER WE GET PAST THIS BUDGET.

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:33.296
AND START THINKING ABOUT WHAT

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:35.265
ECONOMIC RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE IN

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:37.200
A RESPONSIBLE WAY THAT WILL

00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:39.002
ATTRACT. BUSINESS AND THE LIKE.

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:41.671
I THINK THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:50:41.738 --> 00:50:44.674
UNDERSTAND OVER A PERIOD OF

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:47.644
TIME AS WE HAVE SOUGHT. TO

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:50.814
CRAFT BUDGETS WHY THIS APPROACH

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:53.150
IS SO INTELLIGENT. BECAUSE WHAT

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:54.785
HAPPENS IS WOULD YOU LIKE IT OR

00:50:54.851 --> 00:50:56.620
NOT WHEN YOU CUT SERVICES TO

00:50:56.686 --> 00:51:00.123
FOLKS. YOU DON'T ELIMINATE THE

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.259
NEED PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY

00:51:02.325 --> 00:51:03.260
THIS DOING TO BE HOUSE YOU SO

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:04.795
ABOUT THE SORTS OF PROBLEMS.

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:08.932
YOU CAN'T. TAKE A BUDGET AND

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:10.767
JUST OBLITERATED AND JUST CUT

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.769
EVERYWHERE EVERY DOLLAR AFFECTS

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:14.971
HUMAN BEINGS AND HUMAN LIFE A

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:16.673
ROOF OVER SOMEBODY'S HEAD NICHE

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.241
CATION FOOD IN THEIR MOUTH.

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:21.945
BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY.

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:23.246
WHICH PORT DIVIDE THAT WE HAVE

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:25.649
IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THAT

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:27.083
ALTHOUGH THIS THERE IS THIS

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.718
ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO LOSS

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:30.420
CARRY FORWARDS IN THE SCHEME OF

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:32.322
THINGS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:33.857
LARGE DYNAMIC OF WHAT WE'RE

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.892
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HOW WE'RE

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:36.960
TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:37.994
CONSERVATIVE ON THE ONE HAND

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:39.629
BUT YET NOT BECAUSE A WHOLE

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:40.797
HOST OF FOLKS FOLKS BRICK

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:42.933
PROBLEMS. THAT YOU LOOK WHERE

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.434
WE'VE GROWN WHERE WE'RE GOING

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:45.936
AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:47.003
FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN MY

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.673
JUDGMENT. I AM IMPRESSED BY

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.608
THIS BUDGET. I AM IMPRESSED BY

00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:53.210
THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:54.978
HOUSES IN TERMS OF. THE

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:56.446
IMPORTANCE OF THE DIGNITY OF

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:58.281
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF

00:51:58.348 --> 00:51:58.849

OUR JOB IS EVERYBODY HAS

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:10.627
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THEY

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:12.128
REPRESENT. BUT I THINK IF YOU

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:13.396
LOOK AT IT IN THE BIG PICTURE.

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.198

00:52:37.587 --> 00:52:39.823
BUDGET ITEMS ESPECIALLY DURING

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.392
A DEFICIT- I KNOW THAT MANY OF

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:43.593
US MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.362
THRILLED TO VOTE FOR SOME OF

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.330
THE ITEMS BUT AGAIN BUDGET

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:48.532
MAKING IS ABOUT PRIORITIES AND

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:50.467
CERTAINLY REMEMBER. BEING HERE

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:52.869
WITH- MANY OF MY- GOOD FRIENDS

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:54.905
HERE- IN HOME WE CAME INTO THE

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:57.173
LEGISLATURE SOME BEFORE. TWENTY

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.175
TEN WHEN I CAME IN SOME OF. MY

00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:01.545
GOOD FRIENDS- HERE ALSO CAME AT

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.513
THE SAME TIME WE HAD A TWENTY

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.814
EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT

00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:07.617
AND- WE HAD TO MAKE VERY HARD

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:10.887
CHOICES. BUT I ALSO WANT TO

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:13.657
MAKE NOTE AS WE APPROACH- NOT

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:14.491
ONLY THIS BILL BUT THE OVERALL

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:17.527
BUDGET. AS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:19.029
LOS ANGELES- MENTIONED.

00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:21.631
ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA- PRIOR TO

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:24.568
CALVET NINETEEN. WAS ACTUALLY-

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:27.070
DESPITE. THE TAX INCREASES THE

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:28.738
VOTERS PASS ON COUPLE DIFFERENT

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:30.473
OCCASIONS WHICH GOT US OUT OF

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.343
OUR LAST HOLE- DESPITE. OTHER

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.711
THINGS THAT PEOPLE OF CRITIQUE

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:37.681
IS BEING- BAD FOR OUR ECONOMY

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:39.516
ACTUALLY HAD A CONDOM ME THAT

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:40.517
GREW FASTER THAN MOST OF THE

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:42.018
REST OF THE COUNTRY. WE CREATED

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:44.854
MORE JOBS THAN MOST THE REST OF

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:47.791
THE COUNTRY- AND SO. IN FACT

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:49.826
CALIFORNIA OVERTOOK NOT ONLY

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.294
OTHER STATES BUT OTHER

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:52.929
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD IN

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:54.798
TURN DECIDES OF OUR ECONOMY.

00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:57.400
AND SO OVERALL I THINK WE HAVE

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:58.969
TO RECOGNIZE THAT CALIFORNIA

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:01.338
WAS AND ECONOMIC SUCCESS OVER

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:02.505
THE PAST DECADE DOESN'T MEAN

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:05.308
THAT WE DIDN'T- HAVE PROBLEMS

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:06.309
AND I THINK IT WAS NOTED ALSO

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:07.611
BY. A GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS

00:54:07.677 --> 00:54:09.679
ANGELES WE ALSO HAVE TREMENDOUS

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.214
WEALTH DISPARITIES. BEFORE

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:14.651
CODED WE WERE TRYING TO DEAL

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:15.819
WITH ISSUES AROUND. HOUSING

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:17.721
LACK OF HOUSING. OTHER TYPES OF

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:21.658
NEEDS THAT- THAT WERE THERE. AS

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:22.892
WELL AND THEN CERTAINLY

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:26.463
COVERAGE SHOWED UP. NOW I WOULD

00:54:26.529 --> 00:54:29.566
KEEP IN MIND THAT WE HAVE THIS

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:30.834
FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THE

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.168
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATING ARE

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:34.004
ELLIE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT-

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:37.440
DEFICIT BECAUSE- OF A-

00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:40.110
INFECTION THAT. NOT NOT ONLY

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:41.911
LEAD TO A GOVERNMENT ACTIONS

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:42.646
BUT ACTUALLY BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:44.547
RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:46.282
TO GO OUTSIDE TO CHANGE

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:48.518
PEOPLE'S BEHAVIORS. EIGHT N.

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:51.688
FACT WE'VE LOST OVER- A HUNDRED

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:52.288
THOUSAND AMERICANS BECAUSE OF

00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:54.224
IT I THINK WE'RE APPROACHING

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.858
FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS

00:54:54.924 --> 00:54:56.960
STEAD. EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DONE A

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:58.928
MUCH BETTER JOB THAN MOST OF

00:54:58.995 --> 00:54:59.829
THE REST OF THIS COUNTRY IN

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:01.464
ADDRESSING THIS IN FACT IF WE

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:05.769
WANT TO TRY TO UNDO- WHAT'S

00:55:05.835 --> 00:55:06.803
HAPPENED WITH BECAUSE OF IT.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.104
OUR FIRST PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:09.539
SURE WEEK CONTAINING CONTROL

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:10.540
THIS INFECTION SO I CERTAINLY

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:12.942
HOPE THAT ALL OF. THE PEOPLE

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:14.644
HERE WHO HAVE SAID THAT. WHAT

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:15.879
THE PRIORITIES OF COURSE IS TO

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:16.913
GET OUR ECONOMY GOING THINK ALL

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.148
OF US HERE THAT THAT WE WOULD

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:20.016
BE VIGOROUS ADVOCATES FOR

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:21.951
SCIENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS. TO

00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:23.653
ADDRESS COLLUDED WITH SUCH AS

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.156
WEARING MASKS TELLING PEOPLE TO

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:27.490
PHYSICALLY DISTANCE. ARE THOSE

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:29.492
ARE TWO THINGS. THAT ARE

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:31.094
NECESSARY TO PREVENT FURTHER

00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:32.462
SPREAD OF THE DISEASE THAT WILL

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.030
THEN ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:36.399
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE OTHER

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:37.867
THING I'D ALSO POINT OUT IS

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:42.539
THAT ECONOMIES ARE. BY CONSUMER

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:44.307
SPENDING. AN ALMOST BUSINESS.

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:45.408
AND I KNOW THAT WITHOUT

00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:47.644
CUSTOMERS MY BUSINESS WOULD NOT

00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:49.679
BE ABLE ARE ALWAYS MY WAIST

00:55:49.746 --> 00:55:50.246
BUSINESS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

00:55:50.313 --> 00:55:52.482
SURVIVE. AND SO WHEN WE THINK

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:53.783
ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO STIMULATE

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.618
THE ECONOMY. WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:59.289
THINK ABOUT. THE CUSTOMERS. SO

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:01.291
WHO ARE THE CUSTOMERS WELL MANY

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:03.660
OF THE CUSTOMERS ARE PEOPLE WHO

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:05.228
ACTUALLY GET STATE ASSISTANCE.

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:07.630
THEY'RE A SPENDING ACTUALLY

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:08.865
DRIVES ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FOR

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:10.400
OTHER BUSINESS FOR BUSINESSES

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:12.302
TO SUCCEED SO. CERTAINLY WON'T

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:15.071
DISAGREE THAT PRIVATE BUSINESS

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:18.408
IS A VERY IMPORTANT SOURCE. OF

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:21.077
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BUT WE ALSO

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:22.378
RECOGNIZE THAT CONSUMER.

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:24.514
ACTIVITY IS SOMETHING THAT IS

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:25.949
ACTUALLY GENERALLY APPROX

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.684
ESTIMATE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:29.452
OUR ECONOMIC TV IN THE UNITED

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:30.153
STATES IS DRIVEN BY CONSUMER

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.688
ACTIVITY. AND SO WE HAVE TO

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:33.456
THINK ABOUT AS WE CRAFTER

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:35.859
BUDGET HOW DO WE SUPPORT PEOPLE

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.694
IN A WAY THAT NOT ONLY OF

00:56:37.761 --> 00:56:39.529
COURSE. WE WANT TO. ENSURE THAT

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:41.498
THEY CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY THAT

00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:43.867
THEY ARE NOT IN NEED OF BASIC

00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:45.702
NECESSITIES. BUT ALSO THAT

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.137
THEY'RE IN A POSITION TO ALSO

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:48.872
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY IT'S

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:53.076
pCONSUMERS. AND SO I THINK WE

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:54.177
ARE WE HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:56.279
PRIORITIES- THERE CERTAINLY

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:58.281
WHEN LOOKING AT THIS PARTICULAR

00:56:58.348 --> 00:56:59.449
BILL AROUND REVENUES. OTHER

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:00.583
PRICE THING I WOULDN'T MIND

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.785
PERSONALLY MAKING SOME

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:04.654
ADJUSTMENTS TO BUT OVERALL.

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:07.390
CERTAINLY I WOULD BE IN SUPPORT

BASICALLY IT APPROACH TO BE

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.097
SURE THAT WE CAN STRIKE AN

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:15.832
APPROPRIATE BALANCE BUDGET.

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.500
THAT WILL HELP SUSTAIN THE

00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:19.869
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND TAKE A

00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:21.738

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:04.000
THERE'S NO DEBATE ON THE FACT

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.102

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:57.391
THAT HE MIGHT BE TELL THIS

01:39:57.458 --> 01:40:00.094

TASK. WITH ONLY MADE. A COUPLE

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:22.750
OF STEPS. I ARGUE THAT THEY ARE

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:26.854
STEPS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:31.492
AND IN FACT THE BUDGET PROCESS.

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:33.360
AND YOU'LL EXCUSE ME BUT I'VE

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:34.795
TAKEN THE CALL IT NOT A PROCESS

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:37.931
BUT A SCRUM. BUT IT PLAY RUGBY

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:40.267
THEY DID PLAY FOOTBALL. I PLAY

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:42.736
THE LINE AND WHEN YOU START A

01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:43.670
PLATE IT'S ALL OF THIS

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.806
SHUFFLING AND TING AND- NOT

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:47.574
REALLY NECESSARILY ALWAYS

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:50.077
GETTING ANYWHERE A STRONG. THAT

01:40:50.144 --> 01:40:52.012

01:40:52.079 --> 01:40:54.448
BUDGET HAS DEVOLVED INTO WHERE

01:40:54.515 --> 01:40:59.553
WE'RE AT TODAY. AND IN THIS

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:02.956
PARTICULAR BUDGET. REPUBLICANS

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:06.994
WERE NOT INVOLVED. WHEN WE DO

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:07.628
HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AT

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:10.898
LEAST THERE'S AT OPPORTUNE FOR.

01:41:10.964 --> 01:41:14.001
TO EXPRESS OPINIONS TO EXERCISE

01:41:14.067 --> 01:41:17.671
THE DO SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT

01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:18.205
THAT IS THE MISSION OF THE

01:41:18.272 --> 01:41:21.975
SENATE. AND WHOEVER PREVAILS

01:41:22.042 --> 01:41:25.112
PREVAILS. BUT IF YOU REMEMBER

01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:26.079
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ON THESE

01:41:26.146 --> 01:41:27.581
BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AND THE

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:29.850
BUDGET COMMITTEE ITSELF. WE

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:32.553
NEVER LOCKSTEP BOAT. RARELY

01:41:32.619 --> 01:41:36.490
EVER. AND THAT'S A GOOD PART OF

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:41.528
THE PROCESS. NOW OVER THE YEARS

01:41:41.595 --> 01:41:43.363
THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IS IN

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:44.665
ONE PLACE WHERE THERE COULD BE

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:46.834
SOME BART BY PARTISAN

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.536
DISCUSSION NEGOTIATION. EVEN

01:41:49.603 --> 01:41:52.339
SOME INPUT WITH THE GOVERNOR.

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:57.377
HERE IN GERMAN. THAT HAS BEEN

01:41:57.444 --> 01:42:02.082
UTTERLY LACKING. EACH OF US

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:04.384
REPRESENT ONE MILLION PEOPLE.

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:07.254
AND I WOULD ARGUE. BY VIRTUE OF

01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:11.024
CUTTING OUT. THE REPUBLICANS

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:12.426
FROM DISCUSSIONS AND

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:15.062
NEGOTIATIONS. THE CARD IT

01:42:15.128 --> 01:42:16.330
CUTTING OUT A MILLION PEOPLE

01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:19.066
THAT WE REPRESENT. FROM THEIR

01:42:19.132 --> 01:42:22.336
VOICES BEING HEARD JEWELERS.

01:42:22.402 --> 01:42:25.005
THEY SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT

01:42:25.072 --> 01:42:27.241
THAT THEY ARE BEING DENIED THE

01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:29.076
POSITION OF OPPORTUNITY TO

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:31.778
CHANGE THINGS. THE OTHER ALL

01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:33.847
WISH REFORMS THAT YOU WOULD

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:36.216
LIKE TO SEE I REFERRED TO THE

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:36.717
LACK OF REFORMS IN THE

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:39.286
EDUCATIONAL PORTION OF THE

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:41.421
BUDGET WE JUST VOTED FOR. IT

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:42.356
WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL IF THERE

01:42:42.422 --> 01:42:45.659
HAD BEEN SOME. AND I KNOW THAT

01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:47.761
THERE ARE SOME IN THIS BUDGET

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:48.962
AT LEAST IS WHAT I KNOW AT THIS

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:52.633
MOMENT. OUR REFORMS FORMALLY

01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:54.134
DONE THAT ARE BEEN ROLLED BACK

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:56.703
TO SOME DEGREE. AND THERE ARE

01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:59.573
SOME PROVISIONS IN HERE THAT

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.575
ARE ARGUABLY GOOD REFORMS FOR

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:03.310
THE FUTURE. THAT COULD WORK

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:06.213
WARRANT AND ENJOY BIPARTISAN

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:11.752
SUPPORT. NOT THE TAX THE

01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:16.723
BUSINESS THAT IS NOT A REFORM.

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:17.958
AND SOME SEEM TO THINK THAT ANY

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:21.128
TIME THAT YOU IF TAXES TO NEW

01:43:21.194 --> 01:43:23.830
MANTRA HERE. IF YOU GIVE ANY

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:27.968
MONEY BACK. TO THE CITIZENS OR

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:31.638
LEAVE BUSINESS OR CITIZENS OF A

01:43:31.705 --> 01:43:34.508
TAX BURDEN. THAT THAT IS A GIFT

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:37.311
OF PUBLIC FUNDS. WHICH IS

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:39.079
SUPPOSED TO BE ILLEGAL WE

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:40.714
SHOULD NOT MAKE A GIFT OF

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:42.182
PUBLIC FUNDS BUT I THINK THAT

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:44.618
IS AN ABSURDITY. WHERE THE MAD

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:47.220
HATTER'S TEA PARTY. THAT'S

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:49.790
TAXPAYERS MONEY AS I SEE IT.

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:52.059
AND WE NEED TO RESPECT AND THEY

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:54.528
DESERVE TO HAVE A VOICE. IN

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:58.732
THIS INSTITUTION. THERE'S AN

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:00.867
AREA OF GREAT MAGNITUDE THE

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:03.737
ALSO HAS ALONG THE WAY BEEN

01:44:03.804 --> 01:44:07.941
CONSISTENTLY NEGLECT. THAT IS

01:44:08.008 --> 01:44:11.111
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF

01:44:11.178 --> 01:44:13.413
HIGH TECH UPGRADES THAT THE

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.349
STATE HAS EMBARKED UPON OVER

01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:19.386
THIS MANY YEARS. MANY YEARS

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:21.555
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GREAT

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:22.990
TENNESSEE IS A PROVIDE

01:44:23.056 --> 01:44:24.324
TECHNOLOGY FROM THIS WONDERFUL

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:27.227
STATE. TECHNOLOGICAL CAPITAL OF

01:44:27.294 --> 01:44:30.364

BUDGET. NO THE PROCESS GOES

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:43.310
ALONG. THE CHEESE THE LIMITS OF

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:47.447
TIME. AND THEN THERE'S A TECH

01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:48.115
COMPANY THIS IS ALL ALLOW

01:44:48.181 --> 01:44:50.984
THERE'S IS NEW BOB DYLAN BANGLA

WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. AND THEN

01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:04.631
THEY FAIL. NOW SEVERAL YEARS

01:45:04.698 --> 01:45:06.733
AGO IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THERE

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:10.203
WOULD BE A SOLUTION. AG

01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:14.341
DEPARTMENT. WAS CREATED. THERE

01:45:14.408 --> 01:45:15.942
HAVE BEEN SOME ABLE PEOPLE

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:17.477
HEADING THAT DEPARTMENT EVEN

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:21.715
NOW ARE THERE. HOWEVER THE

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:24.284
PRODUCT. HAS BEEN UTTERLY

01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:26.820
LACKING AND GETTING ANYTHING

01:45:26.887 --> 01:45:28.155

THREE TIMES AT LEAST IN MY

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:40.400
COUNTY. IS BEEN RENAMED. DID

01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:42.502
THAT CHANGE ANYTHING. I DON'T

01:45:42.569 --> 01:45:44.404
THINK TO THIS DAY IT HAS IF

01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:46.373
THERE WAS A REFORM THAT SHOULD

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.508
HAVE BEEN IN THIS BILL. THAT'S

01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:50.043
ONE WE SHOULD GET OUR HANDS ON

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:51.478
AND FIGURE OUT IN THIS

01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:53.647
MAGNIFICENT STATE. HOW TO GET

01:45:53.714 --> 01:45:55.649

NOTHING THAT HAVE BEEN A DISMAL

01:45:59.386 --> 01:46:03.890
FAILURE. HERE TO FOR. ONE OTHER

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:06.560
THAT IT WAS OF SOME HISTORIC

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:07.561
INTEREST WITH A TO PORTABLE

01:46:07.627 --> 01:46:11.231
TODAY AS WELL. WE DON'T CHANGE

01:46:11.298 --> 01:46:13.100
ANYTHING WITHIN THE AGENCY. THE

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:16.703
FORMER GOVERNOR MADE A BIG DEAL

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:18.939
OF BLOWING UP THE BOXES MEETING

01:46:19.005 --> 01:46:21.541
THE BUREAUCRACY THESE FAST

01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:23.543
AGENCIES THAT CONTROL THE

01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:25.312
PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT

01:46:25.378 --> 01:46:26.813
CONTROLS OUR LIFE. SUCH A HIGH

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.783
DEGREE. AND THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN

01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:33.920
SUCH A THOMAS. AUTHORITY THE

01:46:33.987 --> 01:46:39.392
BIG AGENCIES. WELL. NOT MANY OF

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:43.130
THOSE BOXES GOT BLOWN UP. IN

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:45.232
FACT MY RECALL ONLY ONE DID.

01:46:45.298 --> 01:46:48.502
WAS THE BIGGEST ONE. DEPARTMENT

01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:51.071
OF CORRECTIONS MANY YEARS AGO.

01:46:51.138 --> 01:46:54.374
IRONICALLY AND I ARGUED AT THE

01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:56.676
TIME THAT AGENCY. WAS BOTTOM

01:46:56.743 --> 01:47:00.180
LIGHT. WORKERS TO THE TOP

01:47:00.247 --> 01:47:02.015
FLIGHT AND BOTTOM HEAVY.

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:03.350
MEETING THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:47:03.416 --> 01:47:09.055
OFFICES. WERE FAR TOO. FEW IN

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:12.159
THOSE OFFICES TO RUN AT THAT

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:13.860
TIME A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:15.228
AGENCY NOW I THINK IT'S

01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:18.732
SOMETHING A YOU LATER MORE. SO

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:20.267
THE BLOW UP OF THE BOXES TOOK

01:47:20.333 --> 01:47:22.869
FOUR WAS. STOP LIGHT AND BOTTOM

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:27.507
HEAVY. AND MADE IT PROPERLY END

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:30.510
BOTTOM HEAVY. THAT'S KIND

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:33.380
REMAIN THAT WAY OVER THE YEARS.

01:47:33.446 --> 01:47:34.815
MAYBE STILL NOW AND WE'RE STILL

01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:39.653
STRIVING. TO MAKE IT BETTER.

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:43.890
BUT AS I ASK. FOR THIS BILL A

01:47:43.957 --> 01:47:47.194
NO VOTE TODAY. I SAY WE DARE

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.796

REPRESENT. LITTLE WHAT WILL BE

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:56.636
UP TO A NINE BILLION DOLLAR TAX

01:47:56.703 --> 01:47:59.539
INCREASE OUT THERE. IN THE

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:04.010
BUDGET. SO INCREASED AND EVEN A

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:09.049
TOUGH TIME. BETTER NOT. SAY

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:09.983
THAT WE'VE DECLARE VICTORY HERE

01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:13.553

EMPLOYEES AT THE HIGH SPEED

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:25.385
RAIL AUTHORITY NOW WHAT'S

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:26.353
INTERESTING TO ME IS IT STATES

01:50:26.419 --> 01:50:28.955
THAT THAT THIS IS AN ESTIMATED

01:50:29.022 --> 01:50:29.889
EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLAR

01:50:29.956 --> 01:50:31.291
SAVINGS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND

01:50:31.358 --> 01:50:33.259
OF MATH IS TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S

01:50:33.326 --> 01:50:34.461
AN EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLAR

01:50:34.527 --> 01:50:36.229
SAVINGS WHEN YOU'RE BRINGING ON

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:37.764
TOO MANY THE STATE EMPLOYEES

01:50:37.831 --> 01:50:39.165
AND THE COST OF CREDIT ITSELF.

01:50:39.232 --> 01:50:42.068
IS HIGHER- THE NEED TO MILLION

01:50:42.135 --> 01:50:43.103
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS THAT IS

01:50:43.169 --> 01:50:45.805
SUGGESTED WITHIN THIS BUDGET.

01:50:45.872 --> 01:50:47.474
THIRTY EIGHT NEW. FOR THE MOTOR

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:48.742
VOTER PROGRAMMING A COST OF SIX

01:50:48.808 --> 01:50:51.745
POINT FOUR MILLION FOR THE DMB.

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:53.446
A PROGRAM THE MOTOR VOTER

01:50:53.513 --> 01:50:54.347
PROGRAM WHICH WAS GOOD

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:56.483
INTENTIONED. BUT DOESN'T WORK

01:50:56.549 --> 01:50:58.018
HAS A NUMBER OF FEELINGS THAT

01:50:58.084 --> 01:51:00.320
WE HAVE YET TO ADDRESS. AND

01:51:00.387 --> 01:51:02.088
HAVE YET TO COMMIT TO FIXING SO

01:51:02.155 --> 01:51:03.923
WHY WOULD WE THEN INVEST MORE

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:05.859
MONEY INTO A PROGRAM. THAT

01:51:05.925 --> 01:51:07.894
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING AND

01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:09.295
I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE

01:51:09.362 --> 01:51:11.731
PUTTING MONEY INTO THE BUDGET.

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:13.633
FOR THE DMB WHICH I THOUGHT. AS

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:15.568
OF EARLIER TODAY WAS GOING TO

01:51:15.635 --> 01:51:17.804
BE TO UPDATE THE I. T. OUR

01:51:17.871 --> 01:51:19.372
SYSTEM IN THE DMB SAID THAT

01:51:19.439 --> 01:51:20.940
THIS MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM COULD

01:51:21.007 --> 01:51:22.675
WORK. THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED

01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:23.843
WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS THAT IN

01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:25.245
FACT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:26.913
MONEY IS NOT GOING TO INVEST IN

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.748
THE I. T. SYSTEM AN UPGRADE.

01:51:28.815 --> 01:51:29.482
IT'S JUST GOING TOWARDS

01:51:29.549 --> 01:51:31.785
PERSONNEL. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:33.753
THAT IMPROVES THE SYSTEM THAT

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:36.856
WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE. SO

01:51:36.923 --> 01:51:38.358
AGAIN AT A TIME WHERE WE ARE

01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:41.094
FACING SUCH A HUGE DEFICIT IN

01:51:41.161 --> 01:51:43.163
MAKING SUCH PAINFUL CUTS.

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:45.131
ACROSS THE BOARD THAT HURTS YOU

01:51:45.198 --> 01:51:46.266
KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

01:51:46.332 --> 01:51:48.068
YOUR- POLITICAL PREFERENCES

01:51:48.134 --> 01:51:49.636
WHAT PARTY YOU BELONG TO IT'S

01:51:49.702 --> 01:51:51.504
HURTING EVERYONE. I JUST DON'T

01:51:51.571 --> 01:51:52.272
UNDERSTAND HOW IN GOOD

01:51:52.338 --> 01:51:54.507
CONSCIENCE WE CAN VOTE FOR

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:55.742
THESE TYPES OF INCREASES IN

01:51:55.809 --> 01:51:57.844
FUNDING WHEN WE SIMPLY DO NOT

01:51:57.911 --> 01:51:59.279
HAVE THE MONEY FOR THOSE

01:51:59.345 --> 01:52:01.781
REASONS I WOULD URGE YOU KNOW

FINAL REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED.

02:03:23.395 --> 02:03:25.030
AND ALTHOUGH THE IMMEDIATE

02:03:25.097 --> 02:03:26.799
PROGRAM CHANGES TOOK EFFECT IN

02:03:26.866 --> 02:03:30.503

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:36.041
THE PROPONENTS OF THIS NEW RULE

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:37.576

ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE REVENUES

02:03:54.527 --> 02:03:55.761
WOULD FLUCTUATE BASED ON

02:03:55.828 --> 02:03:59.165
EMISSIONS. PER YEAR THERE ARE

02:03:59.231 --> 02:04:01.133

LANGUAGE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT.

02:04:21.086 --> 02:04:24.557
WOULD REQUIRE. THAT NEW RULE

02:04:24.623 --> 02:04:26.458
MAKING OCCUR WITHOUT THE

02:04:26.525 --> 02:04:27.993

THE APA ON THIS IS JUST

02:04:44.944 --> 02:04:47.246
OUTRAGEOUS AND SO WHAT IT WOULD

02:04:47.313 --> 02:04:50.216

CHALLENGE AND UNDERMINE THE

02:04:53.085 --> 02:04:54.720
MARKET CONFIDENCE. HOLDING A

02:04:54.787 --> 02:04:56.455

RB- AND THAT REQUIRES

02:05:25.084 --> 02:05:26.585
UNNECESSARY RULE MAKING THAT

02:05:26.652 --> 02:05:28.254

BROWN WORRIED ABOUT FEARED WHAT

02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:53.946
TIME IS HERE. AND IT CAME ON

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:56.015
LIKE A HEART ATTACK JUST IN A

02:05:56.081 --> 02:05:57.783

YEARS AND THIS IS MY MAJOR

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:06.225

02:06:23.943 --> 02:06:24.910
FOR A STATE NOT CONSIDERED

02:06:24.977 --> 02:06:26.545
PHYSICALLY WELL MANAGED BY MOST

WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST

02:06:33.218 --> 02:06:35.054
UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT THAT

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.789
DEFICITS IN THE NATION WE ARE

02:06:36.855 --> 02:06:38.290
RACING NEW JERSEY AND ILLINOIS

02:06:38.357 --> 02:06:40.459
TO THE BOTTOM. AND IN HELLA

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:42.728
BURSTING IS THAT. CALIFORNIA'S

02:06:42.795 --> 02:06:44.563
PER CAPITA NUMBERS PUT IT IN

02:06:44.630 --> 02:06:46.799
THE BOTTOM TEN STATES. IN OUR

02:06:46.865 --> 02:06:48.701
STATE CONTROLLER IS THE ONLY

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:50.002
ONE OUT OF FIFTY STATES IN THIS

02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:51.837
NATION THAT HASN'T PRODUCED

02:06:51.904 --> 02:06:54.673
AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:57.643
OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE REELING. I

02:06:57.710 --> 02:06:59.178
USED TO BE CHAIRMAN OF A CREDIT

02:06:59.244 --> 02:07:01.046
COUNSELING NONPROFIT AND BOY

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:02.548
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE PEOPLE ARE

02:07:02.614 --> 02:07:05.017
JUST A TEETERING ONE PAYCHECK

02:07:05.084 --> 02:07:06.986
AWAY IT CENTERED CENTER THIS IS

02:07:07.052 --> 02:07:09.421
A TOUGH TIME. BECAUSE I BELIEVE

02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:11.623
THIS COVERT NINETEEN RECESSION

02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:12.858
WILL BE A MULTI YEAR EVENT.

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:16.962
THIS BUDGET AND THIS BODY ARE

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:17.463
IGNORING THREE CRITICAL

02:07:17.529 --> 02:07:19.631
STRATEGIES. THE FIRST IS

02:07:19.698 --> 02:07:22.735
DOWNSIZING REDUCING STAFFING IS

02:07:22.801 --> 02:07:24.103
WHAT OUR COUNTERPARTS AT THE

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:26.472
COUNTIES CITIES AND SCHOOL

02:07:26.538 --> 02:07:28.574
DISTRICTS ARE DOING AS WE SPEAK.

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.409
WE CAN'T KEEP LYING AT OR NEAR

02:07:30.476 --> 02:07:31.744
THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:33.979
BILLION DOLLAR LEVEL. AND

02:07:34.046 --> 02:07:36.348
MAINTAINING CURRENT SPENDING

02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:38.650
LEVELS SHOULD BE REEVALUATED.

02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:40.052
THE LONGER SACRAMENTO WAITS TO

02:07:40.119 --> 02:07:41.587
MAKE REAL CUTS VERSUS

02:07:41.653 --> 02:07:43.756
CAPRICIOUS TRIGGER CUTS. THE

02:07:43.822 --> 02:07:45.557
GREATER THE PAIN WILL BE IN THE

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:47.926
NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS. YOU'VE

02:07:47.993 --> 02:07:49.228
ALREADY HEARD ONE SIMPLE

02:07:49.294 --> 02:07:51.964
RECOMMENDATION DROP HIGH SPEED

02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:54.500
RAIL LET'S GET REAL. THAT WOULD

02:07:54.566 --> 02:07:55.834
REALLY MESSAGE TO THE

02:07:55.901 --> 02:07:57.269
CONSTITUENTS THAT SACRAMENTO

02:07:57.336 --> 02:07:59.071
SERIOUS ABOUT IT. BALANCING ITS

02:07:59.138 --> 02:08:03.809
BUDGETS. TO TWO YEARS YOU'LL BE

02:08:03.876 --> 02:08:05.477
NOTIFIED BY CALPERS AND CAL

02:08:05.544 --> 02:08:07.780
STIRS AT THE DEFINED BENEFIT

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:09.281
PENSION PLAN ANNUAL REQUIRED

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:11.050
CONTRIBUTIONS WILL RISE AND

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:13.986
PROBABLY SIGNIFICANTLY. SCHOOL

02:08:14.053 --> 02:08:15.487
DISTRICTS COULD BARELY MAKE

02:08:15.554 --> 02:08:16.688
THEIR PAYMENTS THE LAST FEW

02:08:16.755 --> 02:08:18.624
YEARS EVEN WITH PROP NINETY

02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:20.092
EIGHT FUNDING INCREASES.

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:22.027
BECAUSE OF THEIR REQUIREMENT TO

02:08:22.094 --> 02:08:24.163
ADD MORE TO THEIR PENSION PLAN

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:26.365
CONTRIBUTIONS. WHAT REALLY

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:28.534
NEEDS TO OCCUR CALLING SAYS IS

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:30.335
AND THE SOONER THE BETTER IS A

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:32.638
MASSIVE PENSION REFORM. THE

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:34.039
GOVERNOR WOULD BE WISE TO

02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:35.808
ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE TO MAKE

02:08:35.874 --> 02:08:37.643
RECOMMENDATIONS. THE STATE OF

02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:39.344
WISCONSIN AMPLE STATE OF

02:08:39.411 --> 02:08:41.513
WISCONSIN IMPLEMENTED A SHARED

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:42.714
RISK PLAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

02:08:42.781 --> 02:08:45.284
TWO. AND IT HAS HISTORICALLY

02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:46.085
BEEN FULLY FUNDED FOR MANY

02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:48.287
YEARS NOW. AND IT IT'S CONCEPT

02:08:48.353 --> 02:08:49.922
THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT BUT

02:08:49.988 --> 02:08:52.024
STUBBORNLY HANGING ON TO THE

02:08:52.091 --> 02:08:53.759
CURRENT PLANS MEANS NO PAY

02:08:53.826 --> 02:08:55.260
RAISES OR COST OF LIVING

02:08:55.327 --> 02:08:58.397
INCREASES. THE STATE EMPLOYEES

02:08:58.464 --> 02:09:00.365
FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY CAN HAVE

02:09:00.432 --> 02:09:01.934
BOTH A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.536
PLAN AND PAY RAISES THE MATH

02:09:04.603 --> 02:09:06.905
JUST WILL NOT WORK. IT'S UP TO

02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:09.508
THEM TALK TO US WITH YOUNGER

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:11.910
EMPLOYEES PREFER. TO BE ABLE TO

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:13.712
MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AND PAY

02:09:13.779 --> 02:09:15.447
FOR CHILD CARE OR THEY WANT TO

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:16.415
HAVE MORE WITHHELD FROM THEIR

02:09:16.482 --> 02:09:17.950
PAYCHECKS SO THEY CAN FIND A

02:09:18.016 --> 02:09:20.452
PENSION PLAN WHICH EVENTUALLY

02:09:20.519 --> 02:09:23.622
MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE. THREE

02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:25.290
ANOTHER SYSTEMIC BUDGET BUSTER

02:09:25.357 --> 02:09:28.160
THAT CAN AND SHOULD E TAMED.

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:30.629
IS RETIREE MEDICAL. BUT

02:09:30.696 --> 02:09:32.331
UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF SOME

02:09:32.397 --> 02:09:34.133
NINETY BILLION DOLLARS IS A

02:09:34.199 --> 02:09:36.034
HUNGRY ANIMAL TO FEED IN.

02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:37.369
ORANGE COUNTY ADDRESS THEIR

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:38.837
UNFUNDED ACTUAL REAL CRUDE

02:09:38.904 --> 02:09:41.206
LIABILITY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX

02:09:41.273 --> 02:09:42.074
WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE

02:09:42.141 --> 02:09:44.042
BARGAINING UNITS AND WE REDUCED

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:47.479
OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY 71%

02:09:47.546 --> 02:09:48.413
IF WE COULD DO THAT FOR THE

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.149
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THROUGH

02:09:50.215 --> 02:09:52.651
THIS BODY WE COULD REMOVE SIXTY

02:09:52.718 --> 02:09:54.353
BILLION FROM OUR BALANCE SHEET

02:09:54.419 --> 02:09:56.321
WE COULD REMOVE A SIGNIFICANT

02:09:56.388 --> 02:09:57.489
AMOUNT OF ANUAL REQUIRED

02:09:57.556 --> 02:09:59.691
CONTRIBUTIONS AND YOU MAY FIND

02:09:59.758 --> 02:10:00.459
THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'RE

02:10:00.526 --> 02:10:03.929
LOOKING FOR. FROM DC. CALLING

02:10:03.996 --> 02:10:07.166
FOR ALL TERM LIMITED. BUT WE

02:10:07.232 --> 02:10:09.268
STILL NEED TO TAKE A LONG TERM

02:10:09.334 --> 02:10:12.137
PERSPECTIVE. AND A CRISIS

02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:13.805
PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIESIT'S

02:10:13.872 --> 02:10:16.074
JUST A MATTER OF LEADERSHIP.

02:10:16.141 --> 02:10:18.177
THE DAYS OF TAX INCREASES ARE

02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:20.512
OVER THE DAYS OF PUTTING BONDS

02:10:20.579 --> 02:10:22.514

OVER THE DAYS OF GOLD PLATED

02:10:24.416 --> 02:10:26.585
PENSIONS MUST COME TO AN END

02:10:26.652 --> 02:10:28.053
AND BETTER RETIREMENT

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:29.288
STRATEGIES MUST BE PURSUED MOVE

02:10:29.354 --> 02:10:31.323
FORWARD. THE RETIREE MEDICAL

02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:33.659
PLANS THAT DON'T EVEN INTEGRATE

02:10:33.725 --> 02:10:35.794
WITH MEDICARE ARE INEXCUSABLE.

02:10:35.861 --> 02:10:37.396
COLLEAGUES I'VE BEEN THROUGH A

02:10:37.462 --> 02:10:39.264

TO THIS ISSUE. IT'S A FISCALLY

02:20:52.577 --> 02:20:54.112
AND MORALLY RESPONSIBLE THING

02:20:57.916 --> 02:20:59.417
ADDRESS LAST WEEK IN THE BUDGET.

02:20:59.484 --> 02:21:03.221
COMMITTEE ANOTHER AREA THAT I

02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:05.056
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:06.324
IS NOT BEEN LOOKED OUT FOR

02:21:06.391 --> 02:21:08.459
AWHILE IN A VERY COMPREHENSIVE

02:21:08.526 --> 02:21:11.362
WAY AND THAT'S THE ISSUE OF THE

02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:14.632
COUNTY STATE. YOU KNOW WE SPEND

02:21:14.699 --> 02:21:17.135
TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS. ON

02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:18.536
REALIGNMENT THE TWO REALIGNMENT

02:21:18.603 --> 02:21:20.405
THE NINETY ONE THE TWENTY

02:21:20.471 --> 02:21:21.606

THAT'S UP TO. TWELVE BILLION

02:21:24.075 --> 02:21:29.013

MAKE UP OF THE REALIGNMENT

02:21:31.149 --> 02:21:34.219
PERCENTAGE IS CORRECT. IS

02:21:34.285 --> 02:21:37.255
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD REVIEW.

02:21:37.322 --> 02:21:42.093
I THINK IN LIGHT OF. ALL THE

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:45.129
RECENT EVENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY.

02:21:45.196 --> 02:21:47.866
ASKING US TO END RACISM TO LOOK

02:21:47.932 --> 02:21:50.335
AT SOCIAL JUSTICE TO LOOK AT

02:21:50.401 --> 02:21:52.270
POLICE EXPENDITURES TO LOOK AT

02:21:52.337 --> 02:21:54.172
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN A

02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:56.541
DIFFERENT WAY I THINK IT'S OUR

02:21:56.608 --> 02:21:57.775
RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT THE

02:21:57.842 --> 02:21:59.978
FUNDING OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT

02:22:00.044 --> 02:22:02.847
WE PROVIDE TO COUNTY SINCE TWO

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:04.449
COUNTIES IN TERMS OF

02:22:04.515 --> 02:22:06.818
REALIGNMENT AND I THINK IT'S

02:22:06.885 --> 02:22:10.388
OUR RESPONSIBILITY. THAT WE-

02:22:10.455 --> 02:22:13.324
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:13.892
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THOSE

02:22:13.958 --> 02:22:17.762
ISSUES. SO I THINK I WOULD URGE

02:22:17.829 --> 02:22:18.196
THE GOVERNOR AND THE

02:22:18.263 --> 02:22:21.566
LEGISLATURE. TO CONTINUE TO

02:22:21.633 --> 02:22:22.367
EXAMINE THE ISSUE OF

02:22:22.433 --> 02:22:25.603
REALIGNMENT. DIRECT EXAMINE

02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:26.971
WHETHER OR NOT THE PRIORITIES

02:22:27.038 --> 02:22:29.340
ARE THE PROGRAMS WE WANT THE

02:22:29.407 --> 02:22:29.941
GOVERNMENT LOOKED AT IN LEAST

02:22:30.008 --> 02:22:32.343
TEN YEARS. DO WE WANT TO CHANGE

02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:33.978
THE PRIORITIES TO MORE.

02:22:34.045 --> 02:22:36.848
PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ARE BASED ON

02:22:36.915 --> 02:22:39.250
PERFORMANCE IN WORK AND THAT

02:22:39.317 --> 02:22:42.053
ACTUALLY PRODUCE RESULTS. THAT

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.956
WE WANT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. AND

02:22:45.023 --> 02:22:46.624
BETTER CONDITIONS IN OUR

02:22:46.691 --> 02:22:50.261
COMMUNITIES. AND LASTLY I WANT

02:22:50.328 --> 02:22:52.196
TO ASK THAT THE CONTINUE

02:22:52.263 --> 02:22:56.267
DISCUSSION. REGARDING SANTA

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:58.403
CLARA COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO IRAN

02:22:58.469 --> 02:23:02.307
NAPA. AND SAN MATTEO COUNTIES

02:23:02.373 --> 02:23:04.475
CONTINUE IN TERMS OF THE

02:23:04.542 --> 02:23:05.977
FORMULA FOR E. ROUGH I THINK

02:23:06.044 --> 02:23:09.981
THAT. HOPEFULLY A COMPROMISE

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:12.684
SOLUTION CAN BE WORKED OUT. I

02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:16.487
THINK IF. THE COST OF THESE

02:23:16.554 --> 02:23:20.258
PROGRAMS ON COUNTIES IN TERMS

02:23:20.325 --> 02:23:23.094
OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM

02:23:23.161 --> 02:23:26.831
IS ONEROUS. AND IF IS INDEED

02:23:26.898 --> 02:23:34.639
THE DECISION. TWO IMPOSED. HE'S

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:36.708
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT

02:23:36.774 --> 02:23:38.309
SOME KIND OF ACCOMMODATION IN

02:23:38.376 --> 02:23:41.446
TERMS OF THE PAYMENT BE MADE.

02:23:41.512 --> 02:23:42.880
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT MOST

02:23:42.947 --> 02:23:44.816
THESE COUNTIES ARE SUFFERING.

02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:46.384
IN THOSE VERY PROGRAMS WE CARE

02:23:46.451 --> 02:23:49.120
ABOUT. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:50.488
DOLLARS IN TERMS OF BUDGET

02:23:50.555 --> 02:23:54.258
DEFICITS. SO I THINK THOSE ARE

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:56.461
ISSUES I WANTED REYES I THANK

02:23:56.527 --> 02:23:59.397

ANTICIPATES THAT CRISIS IN

02:32:12.056 --> 02:32:15.726
INCREASES SUPPORT FOR CAL FIRE

02:32:15.793 --> 02:32:17.761
AS IT HAS SUPPORTED. MORE

02:32:17.828 --> 02:32:20.164

02:32:46.524 --> 02:32:48.125
AND I PERSONALLY THINK THE

COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS MAY BE

02:32:51.629 --> 02:32:54.064
AN EARLY WAKE UP CALL. AS WE

02:32:54.131 --> 02:32:56.300

02:33:18.122 --> 02:33:20.257
IN KEEP GETTING PAYCHECKS. THIS

02:33:20.324 --> 02:33:25.529

THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN

COVERED. IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IS

02:33:55.192 --> 02:33:58.896
THAT ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM.

PAY LAW IN AMERICA AND THAT'S

02:42:49.259 --> 02:42:50.794
IMPORTANT BECAUSE TWO THIRDS OF

02:42:50.861 --> 02:42:52.229
MINIMUM WAGE EARNERS IN THE

02:42:52.295 --> 02:42:53.597

STANDING STRONG FOR IMMIGRANTS

02:43:12.782 --> 02:43:14.651
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA WILL BE ONE

02:43:14.718 --> 02:43:17.020
OF THE FIRST MAJORITY MINORITY

02:43:17.087 --> 02:43:19.122

IT'S TIME FOR ALL OF US TO WAKE

02:43:20.223 --> 02:43:22.058

REASONS WHY I AM SUCH A PROUD
