UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OUR

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:24.414
THIS. SO YOU GOTTA TAKE A GOLF

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:28.252

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:30.821
WORKING TO DEAL. WITH THE GOLF

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:33.924

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:40.597
OF IT. OKAY AND THE 25% THAT

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:42.099
SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUSIONARY

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:45.135
ZONING FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:46.203
THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THE BACK

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.205
OF THE BUS THEY'RE GONNA BE

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:49.973
STACKED UP WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.609
A VIEW OF THE GOLF COURSE AND-

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.611
THE RICH PEOPLE. MULTI

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:57.381

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:03.187
GROUP BUT THEN I DON'T THINK I

00:47:03.253 --> 00:47:05.989
QUALIFY. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:09.526
SIXTY FORTY HERE. THE OTHER

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:16.400
THING IS. YOU'LL LOSE. 30% OF

00:47:16.466 --> 00:47:19.937
YOUR GOLF COURSES BASICALLY

00:47:20.003 --> 00:47:22.940
BECAUSE THERE'S MANY GOLF

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:24.942
COURSES BECAUSE OF INSURED ON

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.944
THAT ARE GOING BROKE OR AREN'T

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.946
IN GOOD SHAPE OR FOR WHATEVER

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:31.248
REASON MANY TIMES THE GOLF

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:33.317
COURSES OWNED BY A FAMILY AND

00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:37.921
THE MATRIARCH OF THE FAMILY DIES

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:40.157
AND THE KIDS JUST WANT THE MONEY

00:47:40.224 --> 00:47:43.260
. SO THEY'LL BE A- TURNOVER OF

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:46.563
GOLF COURSES HERE SO THE REASON

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:47.864
MY COLLEAGUES YOU'RE HEARING

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:51.335
THIS OPPOSITION IS THEY EITHER

00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:54.371
SENSE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:56.473
THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.542
. MADAM CHAIR THAT IS MY

00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:59.943
COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.845

00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:08.485
CHAIR AND TO GOOD TO SEE YOU

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:09.086
AGAIN FOR ANOTHER FOR ANOTHER

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:14.358
ROUND OF- OF HEARINGS- I'M GOING

00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:16.827
TO SUPPORT THIS BILL- BUT I'M

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:18.729
DOING SO VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND I'M

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:20.931
RESERVING MY RIGHT TO VOTE

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:23.033
AGAINST IT WHEN IT- IF AND WHEN

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:27.804
IT COMES TO THE FLOOR- I THINK.

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.339
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONCERN I

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:30.874
HAVE IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.343
WE'RE PICKING THE WINNERS AND

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.212
LOSERS HERE FLAG OFF COURSES AND

00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:37.547
WHY NOT BSEBALL DIAMONDS AND

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:39.516
SOCCER FIELDS AND ONE OF THE

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:40.917
SPEAKERS. MENTIONED EQUESTRIAN

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:43.820
USES- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:45.589
DIFFERENT ABOUT A GOLF COURSE-

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:47.824
AS A RECREATIONAL USE AS OPEN

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:50.861
SPACE- COMPARED TO SOME OF THOSE

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:53.530
OTHER. USES I DO UNDERSTAND- THE

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:56.600
NEED. TO IDENTIFY PLACES WHERE

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:59.102
WE CAN BUILD HOUSING AND I THINK

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:00.003
THAT'S A VERY PRESSING AND

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.405
IMPORTANT NEED AND I'VE-

00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:01.938
PROBABLY GONNA HAVE SOME

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:04.041
LEGISLATION ON MY OWN ON THAT

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:05.175
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A PROPOSAL

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:09.546
OR TO- IN IN MY DISTRICT. TO

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:12.182
CONVERT. OF A SOME UNDER

00:49:12.249 --> 00:49:14.885
UTILIZED TO- PROPERTIES TO-

00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:16.920
HOUSING AND PARTICULARLY

00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:21.491
AFFORDABLE HOUSING- FIVE I THINK

00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:25.629
IT'S GOOD THAT THIS- IS LOCALLY

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:28.098
FOCUSED IT'S UP TO THE LOCAL

00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:29.199
GOVERNMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.834
OR NOT THEY WANT TO TAKE

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:32.602
ADVANTAGE OF THIS BUT I THINK-

00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:35.172
ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL MAKES A

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:37.841
GOOD POINT IN SAYING THAT-

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:39.142
ULTIMATELY IF WE OPEN UP THE

00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:41.611
STORE DEVELOPERS WILL START TO-

00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:43.847
DRIVE THE PROCESS AND YOU KNOW

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:46.049
IDENTIFY SPACES WHERE THEY THINK

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:47.250
THEY CAN BENEFIT LOCAL

00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:48.385
GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:51.688
FIND A WAY TO- AT ACHIEVE SOME

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:54.057
ADDITIONAL REVENUE AND I JUST.

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:57.027
QUESTION IF WE WANT TO OPEN UP

00:49:57.094 --> 00:50:01.965
THAT PANDORA'S BOX AND- OPEN UP

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:04.401
THESE- FOR THE MOST PART WHILE

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:05.902
PRESERVING BUT BY THE WAY I

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:08.271
DON'T HAVE ANY GOLF COURSES- NOT

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:12.609
THE CITY I LIVE AND- OF. PUBLIC

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.878
GOLF COURSES IN THE CITY I LIVE

00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:17.114
IN AND I THINK IN MY AN ENTIRE

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.081
DISTRICT WHICH MIGHT SURPRISE

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:21.818
SOME PEOPLE- I DO HAVE A LOT OF

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:24.988
OUT OF IT- PRIVATE YOU. EXCUSE

00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:27.591
ME PUBLIC USE GOLFERS- AND I

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:29.259
THINK I HEARD FROM BOTH OF THEM

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.128
OFF WHEN THAT PARTICULARLY WHEN

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:33.029
THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE FILM

00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:34.931
WAS- WHAT WAS BEING DISCUSSED

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:38.168
PUBLICLY- THERE IS A LOT OF

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:40.170

THE OVERALL- SPORTS AREA BUT- I

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:51.515
DON'T SEE WHY THAT MEANS THE-

00:50:51.581 --> 00:50:53.016
GOLF COURSES SHOULD HAVE ANY

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.152
