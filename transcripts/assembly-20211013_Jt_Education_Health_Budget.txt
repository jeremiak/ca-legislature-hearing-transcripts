JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER TWO ON EDUCATION AND FINANCE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER ONE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I SEE SOME OF THE CHAIRS ARE HERE NOW- SOME OF THE- THEY ARE HERE SO WE WITH THE MISSION TODAY IS TO HAVE A VERY FRANK DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPROVING ACCESS. TO SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IT'S NOT THAT WE NEED TO DO IT IT'S ABOUT HOW WE DO IT IS ABOUT THE LOGISTICS AND MECHANICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PROVIDING THESE SERVICES AND THEN OFTEN BILLING BACK EITHER INSURANCE COMPANY MEDIC CAL AND SO FORTH TO PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES. BECAUSE THEY ARE COSTLY TO PROVIDE NO DOUBT AND WE WANT DISTRICTS TO RECOUP THAT MONEY HOW OFTEN IT COMES FROM FEDERAL SOURCES AS WELL. AND IT IS THE PERCEPTION OF MANY THAT THE RULES ARE COMPLEX HARD FOR DISTRICTS TO FOLLOW HARD FOR DISTRICTS TO LEARN. AND SO THEY DID TAKE A PASS OFTEN AND DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM SO AGAIN THE DISCUSSION TODAY IS NOT THAT WE NEED TO DO IT. IT IS THE HOW WE DO IT- SO I'M CONGRESS MORE TO THIS MEETING TO ORDER. ASSURING IS JOINTLY SPONSORED. BY THE ASSEMBLY AND COMMITTEES ON EDUCATION.

WE VERY MUCH RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE IS ABOUT KEEPING CHILDREN HEALTHY AND GETTING THEM AND KEEPING THEM IN SCHOOL. THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED. THE FOR US THE CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN STUDENT HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND THEIR OVERALL ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. WE KNOW THAT PROVIDING HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOL SITES IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF MEETING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. FOR TOO LONG OUR SYSTEM OF PROVIDING LAW SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. HAS PROVEN OVERLY COMPLEX AND BURDENSOME BURDENSOME. SCHOOLS OFTEN FAIL TO PARTICIPATE IN MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS OR ONLY BILL FOR PORTION OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE LEAVING FEDERAL MONEY. ON THE TABLE. AND IT ALSO TAKING VALUABLE DOLLARS AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM DISTRICTS JUST SIT IT OUT. BOB PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN SCHOOLS COUNTY AGES IS COUNTY AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS OFFER ANOTHER WAY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO STUDENTS BUT AGAIN TOO FEW OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS EXIST. AS A RESULT TOO MANY STUDENTS DO NOT RECEIVE THE SERVICES THEY ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN STUDENT HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND G. H. C. S. TO FORM A WORK GROUP TO STUDY THIS ISSUE TO IDENTIFY THE BARRIERS. TO REPORT TO BILL FOR THE SERVICES AND TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE ACCESS WE'RE HERE TODAY TO HEAR ABOUT CONCRETE ACTIONS THAT CAN AND WILL BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS. THIS CRITICAL NEED AGAIN THAT'S THE LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING THE SERVICES AND RECOUPING THE COST FOR PROVIDING THE SERVICES. FIRST WE WILL HEAR FROM WEST ED THE CONTRACTOR HIRED TO FACILITATE THIS WORKGROUP. ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT WAS UNDERTAKEN IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. FOLLOWING THEIR PRESENTATION WE'LL HEAR FROM TWO STATE AGENCIES CD AND DH CS REGARDING THEIR PLANS TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT AS WELL AS ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE BUDGET TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS TO SCHOOL BASED. HEALTH CARE. FINALLY WE'LL HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS IN BOTH EDUCATION AND HEALTH FIELDS WITH THEIR THOUGHTS ON KEY BARRIERS AND THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. BIOGRAPHY BIOGRAPHIES OF ALL OUR SPEAKERS ARE INCLUDED IN YOUR HEARING PACKETS AND ARE POSTED ON THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION WEBSITE.

AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP WITH AN EDUCATION TO ADVANCE SOME OF THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS AND BELIEVE THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LOOK TO PULLING DOWN INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND HOPE THAT WE CAN CREATE SOME CONVERSATIONS TODAY ABOUT HOW THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT OUR STUDENTS WE HAVE A REAL CHANCE HERE WHEN YOU INVEST IN SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS EDUCATION AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR US TO WORK TOWARDS EQUITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. I MISS RUBIO.

DEMOGRAPHIC WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO INFORM US SO WE CAN GIVE YOU. THE RESOURCES. NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES BECAUSE THESE SERVICES ARE VERY IMPORTANT. I WAS TIED TAUGHT SEVENTH GRADE ON MONDAY. OKAY OKAY GREAT ON FRIDAY- BUT I CAN TELL YOU IT'S VERY INTERESTING WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR SCHOOL SITES LOGISTICALLY. WITH THE PANDEMIC AND ALSO FROM A MENTAL HEALTH AND ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE. IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO WALK INTO A CLASSROOM IT'S HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE UP HERE SAY HEY SCHOOLS NEEDED TO THE SCHOOLS NEED TO DO THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT IS VERY DIFFERENT. WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE CLASSROOM AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND KNOW THAT SOME STUDENTS ARE QUARANTINE. AND I'M NOT THERE THAT DAY AND- THAT THERE WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC AND IS IT IS JUST VERY. INTERESTING AND YOU KNOW VERY EDUCATING A WALK IN THE UNDER SCHOOL SITE SEE THAT HAPPENING RATHER THAN JUST TRYING COMMANDED FROM THE SACRAMENTO LEVEL.

IN A VERY UNIQUE WAY- AND PRIVILEGE THAT WEST I HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY HELP FACILITATE. AND MOVE THESE CONVERSATIONS FORWARD OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- AND I'M APPRECIATIVE TO THE WEST A TEAM THE OVER TWO DOZEN STAFF- THAT HELP TO SUPPORT THE STATE AGENCIES AND TO SUPPORT THE STAKEHOLDERS- IN COMING UP WITH WHAT YOU NOW HAVE- AS THE FINAL- SB SEVENTY FIVE MEDIC COW FOR STUDENTS WORKGROUP REPORT AND THE ASSOCIATED ADDENDUM SO. I'M PART TIME- THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF FOR THIS PANEL IS- CAN OFFER SOME VERY- BASIC HIGH LEVEL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROCESS. ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE ARRIVED AT AND ALSO SOME OBSERVATIONS AROUND WHAT RESULTED- THINGS THAT WERE- THEY CAME TOGETHER FOR BOTH THE STATE AGENCIES BUT ALSO FOR THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS- WE CAN GO TO SIDE. FOR PLEASE. GREAT SO I JUST AS A REMINDER TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE PUBLIC- THIS WAS THE AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION- THAT ALLOWED THIS WORKER TO PROCEED- BEGINNING IN- WITH THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN- WE HAD- TWO YEARS IN WHICH TO COMPLETE THE WORK. ORIGINALLY ON A TIMELINE OF ONE YEAR BUT THE ADDITIONAL YEAR ADDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GO FURTHER AND DEEPER- THE RESULTED IN SOME VERY- SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT- SHOWS CONSENSUS. BETWEEN BOTH STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS A RECOGNITION OF HOW THIS SPACE AROUND BRINGING. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES INTO SCHOOLS CAN HAPPEN IN A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT. AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. SO WHEN I TALK FOR JUST A MOMENT ABOUT- THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE USE WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- IN ORDER TO ARRIVE. AT WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE FINAL REPORT- THAT REALLY USED TO KIND OF THREE STAGE PROCESS FIRST. TO UNDERSTAND AND INTERROGATE THE CHALLENGE THAT- WAS PRESENTED BY BRINGING MORE OF THESE MENTAL. AND HEALTHY SERVICES INTO SCHOOLS AND IN PARTICULAR WAS REALLY ASSESSING THE SYSTEM BARRIERS- STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES. THAT LED TO A SET OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT VARIOUS IDEAS THAT COULD BASICALLY BE IMPLEMENTED AS A RESPONSE TO SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES. THAT WE SAW AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE SYSTEM. AND THOSE SET OF IDEAS WERE THEN WORKED OVER WITHIN SEVERAL SUBGROUPS- IN THE IN THE WORK GROUPS THAT INCLUDED BOTH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS SECTION. OF VARIOUS PLACES ACROSS CALIFORNIAIN BOTH THE EDUCATION AND IN THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH FIELDS. THAT WERE ALSO SUPPLEMENTED BY STAFF FROM VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT WERE THERE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE- IN CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AS THE WORKER FOR COMING UP WITH A SET OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE NOW REPRESENTED. AS RECOMMENDATIONS- IN THE REPORT WHICH WAS THE FINAL STAGE OF THE PROCESS. THAT INCLUDED THE REPORT WRITING PROCESS- IN WHICH THE STAKEHOLDERS HAD OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH TO REVIEW AN OFFER FEEDBACK- AND MOVED ITS WAY THROUGH BOTH OF THE STATE AGENCIES BEFORE FINALLY BEING PUBLISHED. ON OCTOBER FIRST. SO ON THE NEXT SIDE I JUST WANNA TALK FOR. JUST A MOMENT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TIMELINE OF THAT PROCESS AND YOU CAN SEE EACH OF THOSE STEPS OF THEIR KIND OF LAID OUT HERE ON THE SLIDE. THAT STARTED WITH THAT FIRST- WORKGROUP MEETING IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND WENT THROUGH AN INTERNET PROCESS IN WHICH WE WERE DOING WORK IN BETWEEN THE STAKEHOLDER- MEETINGS WORKING WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT WAS PRIMARILY MADE UP OF- WEST AT STAFF HELPING BOTH STATE AGENCIES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I TO BRING TOGETHER THAT INFORMATION AND FORM IT INTO THE NEXT WORKGROUP MEETING SUBSEQUENT TO THE LAST ONE. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT PROGRESS REPORT THAT WE PUBLISHED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT WAS OF A SUBSTANTIAL MILESTONE IN MOVING INTO. THE RECOMMENDATIONS DEVELOPMENT WHICH WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS- THIS PREVIOUS YEAR. RESULTING IN THIS FINAL REPORT SO. HELPFUL HOPEFULLY TO LAY OUT SOME OF THE PARTS OF THE PROCESS- HOUSE STAKEHOLDERS ARE INVOLVED HAVE THE STATE AGENCIES WERE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. AND I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TIE REMOTE WHO'S GOING TO GO OVER SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE- WRITTEN UP AND PROVIDED IN THE REPORT. THANK DJS AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE- EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. AND THEN AT PRESENT THAT MEDICAL FOR STUDENTS WORKGROUP RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE FINAL REPORT. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THE ON THE NEXT SIDE THAT THE WORKGROUP RECOMMENDATIONS FALL INTO FIVE BROAD AREAS. STATE INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION LOCAL AGENCY TRAINING GUIDANCE. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES DEMONSTRATION FOR AIDS. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY BILLING OPTION PROGRAM ON IT SUPPORT. AND ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE THROUGH EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ASSOCIATED ACTIONS NOW ONE BY ONE. ON THE NEXT SLIDE RECOMMENDATION ONE. IS TO FORMALIZE STATE LEVEL COLLABORATION BETWEEN EDUCATION AND HEALTH SYSTEMS. ASSEMBLY ACTION ONE HEY ASKED WE PROVIDE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO THAT THEY CAN HIRE AND RETAIN DEDICATED STAFF TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF ONGOING STATE LEVEL COLLABORATION. AND ONE BE UTILIZED ADVISORY GROUP TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE RELATED TO COLLABORATION BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. AND THE WORKER FOR THE RECOGNIZE THAT THE ADVISORY GROUP THAT INCLUDED AT PORT STAKEHOLDERS AND THOSE ARE USING FAMILIES REPRESENTATIVES FROM DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SERVICES HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY BROADLY DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. AND THEY ALSO RECOMMEND INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES TO COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS MANAGED CARE PLANS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL. AND RECOMMENDATION NUMBER TWO IS TO PROVIDE TARGETED TRAINING AND GUIDANCE TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE ONLY AS- AND HEALTH PLANS AS WELL ON IMPLEMENTING SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS TO MAXIMIZE BILLING AND REIMBURSEMENTS ON SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES. AND ALSO TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR MEDICAID ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. ACTION EIGHT HERE'S YOUR PRODUCE TRAINING AND TARGETED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES FOR EDUCATION HEALTH SYSTEM PROVIDERS INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY ELEAZAR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND MANAGED CARE PLANS. SB IT IS TO CREATE CONDITIONS THAT WILL ENABLE COLLABORATION BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS AT LEAST FLOURISH AND MUCH OF THIS CONVERSATION AMONG THE WORKGROUP MEMBERS WAS RELATED TO ACTING LIKE SHARED OWNERSHIP. AND FOCUSING ON THE CHILD AS THE CENTER OF SERVICES IN THE WORK WE DO. AND IN ADDITION WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE AND WORK LEGALLY ALLOWABLE WORKGROUP RECOMMENDS WE ENCOURAGE CONTRACTS AND MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN ELEAZAR AND MANAGED CARE PLANS AS WELL AS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. AND RECOMMENDATION THREE IS TO CREATE A SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES DEMONSTRATION SITES TO IMPROVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S PROVIDED DELEGATES ABOUT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND TO CAPITALIZE ON THE RECENT SCHOOL BASED MEDICAID INVESTMENTS AND INITIATIVES. THE FIRST ACTION HERE IS TO ENGAGE A CONTRACTOR TO PILOT LISTS GT'S DANCE FOCUSED ON SOME EXTRACTIONS. ASSEMBLY TO LEARN WORKS TO SCALE UP THESE PROGRAMS AND EXPAND ON. AND SPECIFICALLY THE WORKGROUP WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THE DEMONSTRATION SITES LEVERAGE THE NEW SCHOOL BASED MEDICAID INVESTMENTS AND INITIATIVES. FIRSTLY PRODUCED EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN ELEAZAR- MANAGED CARE PLANS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND ONLY A POP AND SCHOOL BASED MEDIC HOW ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITY IS NOT A SMALL PROGRAM VENDORS AND THEN SECOND TO PROVIDE A WIDE ARRAY OF SERVICES TO MEDICAID ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. AND END OF A BIG DEAL HERE SPEAKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF ALL THREE MEDICAID ACCESS POINTS SO THERE ARE PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS THE STATE CURRENTLY THAT I UTILIZE WONDER OR TO OUR PORTION OF THESE TYPES O PARTNERSHIPS BUT THE IDEA BEING THAT THESE DEMONSTRATION SITES WOULD BUT HAVE ALL THREE OF THOSE THREE BEING. COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS MANAGED CARE PLANS AND FINALLY THE. ONLY A BLOCK AND A SMALL PROGRAM. AND THEN. APPLIED LESSONS. THAT THAT WE LEARN FROM THESE BASED OUT SERVICES DEMONSTRATE SITES TO INFORM THE FUTURE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S PROVIDED TO ALL THE IS AND ALSO TO HELP WITH. AND RECOMMENDATION NUMBER FOUR TO FACILITATE THE L. A. BILLING OPTION PROGRAM OR ALL THE L. A. BACH AUDIT PROCESS. THE WORKER RECOMMENDS IMPLEMENTING FEEDBACK LOOPS BETWEEN ELLIE A IS AND THE DHS ON ITS INVESTIGATION DIVISION. THAT FOSTER COLLABORATIVE LEARNING AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND THEN ALSO DEVELOPING RESOURCES THAT SUPPORT ELLIE A AUDIT PREPARATION SPECIFICALLY- SO FIRST ACTION HERE IS TO ENHANCE UNDER PROCESSES THROUGH AUDITOR TRAINING. INFORMED BY USER EXPERIENCE AND SPECIFICALLYTHE EXPERIENCE. OF THOSE THERE ON THE GROUND AND ELEAZAR. AND GATHERING REGULAR FEEDBACK FOR MILLIONS ABOUT THERE. ON IT EXPERIENCES. SB DEVELOP AUDIT RELATED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROCESS SEEKS TO SUPPORT ELEAZAR BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THE L. A. BACH AUDIT PROCESS. AND THEN FINALLY RECOMMENDATION NUMBER FIVE. IS TO IDENTIFY OPTIONS FOR EXPANDING ACCESS TO SCHOOL BASED PREVENTIVE PHYSICAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. AND ACTION EIGHT HERE IS TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND SCHOOLS WHEN THE CHILD HAS THE RISK FACTORS BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A DIAGNOSIS THAT QUALIFIES THEM FOR SERVICES. AND THEN BEAT TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR SCHOOL BASED PREVENTIVE PHYSICAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AND THE WORKGROUP KNOWS THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR SUCH SERVICES. AND SPECIFICALLY THAT THE FREE MARKET IDENTIFIED THE FUNDING SOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR EACH SERVICE. SO THOSE ARE THE WORKGROUP AND RECOMMENDATIONS AS A PARENT APART AND I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND TURN IT OVER TO AMBER AND CHECK. THIS OUT. NUMBER. THANK YOU SO MUCH HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS AMBER ABOUT THAT AND I'M A SENIOR ASSOCIATE AND CO DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL FOR STUDENTS PROJECT THAT WEST AND I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY SHARE SOME ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES OF THE MEDICAL FOR STUDENTS WORKGROUP RECOMMENDATION DEVELOPMENT. PROCESS WHILE THE RECOMMENDATION FOR A MAJOR OUTCOME OFTHIS WORK SO TOO ARE THE RELATIONAL AND WHARNCLIFFE ALCHEMY OF THE PROJECT MOST NOTABLY OUTCOMES RELATED TO. INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE STATE AGENCIES COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WITH EDUCATION AND HEALTH REPRESENTATIVES ACROSS THE STATE. AND FINALLY SHARED RESPONSIBILITY ACROSS THE STATE AGENCIES AND ALSO ACROSS EDUCATION AND HEALTH SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA- THROUGH THIS PROCESS PARTICIPATING LEADERS FROM THE CVT ACS AND SEE A PAGE THAT. HAS SHARED HOW COLLABORATION BETWEEN AGENCIES HAS BEEN ELEVATED TO ANOTHER LEVEL. INCLUDING INCREASED CREEK- COMMUNICATION BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL BETWEEN AGENCIES. OR CALL THE HEALTH. AND THE BUILDING A TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGENCY STAFF THE HEALTH CARRY THE WORK FORWARD IN MORE MEANINGFUL WAYS. AND THESE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE ALSO OPENED UP SPACE FOR AGENCY LEADERS TO BUILD SHARED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW WILL BE HEALTH RELATED WORK. HAPPENS WITHINWITHIN EACH. WITHIN. EACH STATE AGENCY CONTACT- ALSO A REIMAGINE OF COMMUTING GAVE WHETHER KEY OUT OF PROCESS THE STATE AGENCIES CO CREATED AND PARTICIPATED IN TRANSFORMATIVE ENGAGEMENT PRACTICES. WITH THE WORK GROUP THAT HELPED MAKE THE VOICES OF THE WORKGROUP FRONT AND CENTER THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE PROJECT. ACTRESS IS ALSO HELP TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN THE STATE AGENCIES AND WORKERS MEMBERS AND TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATE AGENCY LEADER AND WORKERS NUMBERS TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER'S EXPERIENCES IN CALIFORNIA'S COMPLEX SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SYSTEM. FINALLY THE WORKER PROCESSES HELP TO BUILD SHARED RESPONSIBILITY AND A PATH TOWARD GREATER COHESION ACROSS THE STATE AGENCIES AND EDUCATION AND HEALTH SECTORS FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH. AS EVIDENCED IN THE WORKGROUP FINAL REPORT. THESE RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT- THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS HAVE HELPED HOLDEN REPORTS BUT SHARED PURPOSE FOR EXTENT EXPANDING SCHOOL BASED HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. IN A COLLECTED- COLLECTIVE AIM FOR MAKING SURE OUR CHILDREN AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE KIND OF CARE THAT WILL HELP THEM THRIVE. FAMILY MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE ABOUT THE MEDICAL FOR STUDENTS CORPORATE PROCESS RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUTCOMES. AND GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR NEXT SEGMENT- FOR RESPONSES FROM THE STATE AGENCIES FROM TAKE A PLAN ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND DR DANIEL LEVY DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE EQUITY BRANCH AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU S. TO THE TEAM FROM WEST AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THAT THE NEXT PANEL MOMENTARILY BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT I DO ANT TO GOING TO QUESTIONS A LOT OF TIMES AND HEARINGS WE HEALTH QUESTIONS TO THE AND THAT'S WHAT I KIND OF WANT TO INTERJECT HIM. AS WE GO THROUGH EACH PANEL BECAUSE IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC- IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT WOULD HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE THE MEMBERS- TO COME BACK UP TO SACRAMENTO- SO WITH THAT I DO WANNA KNOW THE PRESENCE OF MAJORITY LEADER SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER TWO. ON EDUCATION OF FINANCE- MISTER MCCARTY WHO HAVE JOINED US. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US- I'VE- OTHER A SEVEN MEMBER EARLIER DIDN'T SEE WHY. UPON SIMILAR. LEAVE HERE AS WELL- SO AGAIN- A VERY IMPORTANT TO. I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS I'VE GOT TO SEE RECOMMENDATIONS THANK YOU CLEAR AND CONCISE- WELL SHARED AND WELL PRESENTED THANK YOU- EIGHT TO ME. SO I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK THE PROBLEM HERE% BECAUSE I WANNA GET US LOST ON THE PROBLEM AND AGAIN IT ISN'T THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND BILL BACK FOR THAT SERVICE HOW DISTRICTS CAN BILL BACK SO THEY ARE PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES- SO I KEY IN HERE IS THE THEM THE RECOMMENDATION NUMBER TWO LOCAL AGENCY TRAINING AND GUIDANCE THIS IS KEY- YESTERDAY A CONVERSATION WITH- WITH ONE OF- THE SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT I KNOW- AND I SAID HEY ARE YOU DOING THIS HAVE YOU BEEN DOING SAID YES BUT IT'S VERY CUMBERSOME. HE SAID IN A FEDERAL REGULATIONS LAND THE STATE REGULATIONS AND UNDER STATE REGULATIONS EXAGGERATED JUST FEES SO IT'S A REALLY TRAINING I THINK IT IS KEY HERE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE HAVE A LEAD AGENCY TO TRAIN FOLKS WHY IT WOULD THEN I'M A NATURAL IT WILL BE C. D. E. AND I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO- IF YOU LIKE A RECOMMENDATION THREE WE PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET. A RECENTLY TO ADDRESS NUMBER THREE TO CREATE SOME DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS SO THAT SCHOOLS CAN LEARN AND WE CAN CREATE SOME TRAINERS TO THEN GO OUT TO OTHER DISTRICTS AND TRAIN THEM HOW TO PERFORM THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY BUT I'LL JUMP A RECOMMENDATION BEFORE YOU TALK ABOUT THE AUDIT THE L. A. B. BOB ON IT- SUPPORT AT THE WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING IS DISTRICTS BILL. THEY THEY PERFORM THE SERVICE BILL FORD AND THEY'LL GET AUDITED MAYBE THREE YEARS LATER AND THEN 70% OF THEIR MONEY THEY HAVE TO PAY BACK- TO WHETHER THE FEDERAL STATE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW SOME SOME PROCESS CORRECTLY AND I KNOW THAT AUDITORS AUDIT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO- THEY DON'T PERFORM THE SERVICES ON THE GROUND SO THAT MAYBE ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A DISCONNECT. BETWEEN THE AUDIT AND THE ACTION ON THE GROUND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT I ASSUME THIS WOULD BE THE AUDITOR THE STATE AUDITOR THAT WOULD THAT WOULD THAT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF EDUCATE SOME FOLKS ON THE GROUND AS TO HOW TO DO THIS BETTER SO THAT THEY DON'T. AN AUDIT SOME YEARS LATER I HAVE TO GIVE UP. A LOT OF MONEY AND PAY PAY MONEY BACK. THANK YOU- CHAIRED ON AFFORD. THE QUESTION I ALL CERTAIN THE NUMBING BY MIKE. TOM MY TO THE- YOUR AS WELL- DID QUITE A OF WORK WITH THE SUB. SUB GROUP- FROM TH WORK GROUP THAT WAS LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. THE PROCESS BY WHICH ON THE AUDIT TO KERR IS ACTUALLY UNIT WITHIN THE H. C. S. SO. THEY ARE- RESPONSIBLE FOR- BASICALLY LOOKING OVER THESE- EXPENDITURES THAT ARE BEING CLAIMED. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM DALY BACH AND ASKED MY PROGRAMS ARE UNIQUELY DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF THE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH- DOLLARS ARE DRAWN FROM COUNT. FROM BY CALIFORNIA FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WITH REGARD TO MEDIC CAL IN CALIFORNIA. I'M HAVING SAID THAT ONE OF OUR OBSERVATIONS IS THAT. THE DH CS IN PARTICULAR I'M HAS REALLY BEEN WORKING WITH A VERY STRANGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES GIVEN WHAT'S REQUIRED. I KIND OF PUT FORTH BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO- ESSENTIALLY VALIDATE THAT THE COSTS THAT ARE BEING CLEANED BY DISTRICTS ARE. ARE DRAWN DOWN APPROPRIATELY. SO THAT THE- AND RECOGNIZING THE INVESTMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE- HAS MADE THROUGH THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS GOING TO CONTRIBUTE. TO HELPING TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF TRAINING AND- THAT KIND OF CAPACITY BUILDING SUPPORT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WILL BE NECESSARY SO THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN. BOTH THAT AUDIT OFFICE AND THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE- THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THOSE THOSE REVIEW PROCEDURES- IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THAN THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. SO BUT I ALSO WANTED BY THAI- TALK FOR ANY OTHER OBSERVATIONS- TO THE- TO THE TERRACE QUESTION. THANK YOU JASON I MADE SO YOU CAN HEAR DIRECTLY I'M ACTUALLY JUST PASS IT OVER TO JACOB I SEE THAT YOU'VE TURNED YOUR- CAMERA ON ARE YOU AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO THIS FROM THE DCS RESPECTIVE. HI MY NAME IS JAKE ONE ON SYSTEM TO THE DIRECTOR HEALTH CARE FINANCING HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I'VE DEFINITELY HEARD THE CONCERN RELATED TO AUDITING REQUIREMENTS AND OUR ELITE. PROGRAM AND HOW WE PROVIDE TRAINING TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I THINK AS MISTER WILLIS INDICATED. YELLING ABOUT PROGRAM IS UNIQUE. THE FACT THAT IS A POSSIBILITIES REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM AND USES A CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE. OF FUNDING MECHANISM TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS IN WHAT THAT MEANS. IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES US TO AUDIT ALL OF THE EXPECT SURE THAT WE PAY TO COST. SO OBVIOUSLY THAT IMPOSES A LARGE AUDIT BURDEN ON THE PROVIDERS AND STATE TO PROVIDE THOSE AUDITS HAVE DEFINITELY HEARD. CONCERNS RELATED TO THE TIMELINESS OF THOSE AUDITS AND TRAINING RELATED TO THAT. AS MENTIONED IN THIS LATEST BUDGET ACT WE RECEIVED- LIMITED TERM FUNDING TO PROCURE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANT CONTRACT TO HELP PROVIDE TRAINING TO L. A. POPS. ARE RELATED TO THE TO THE TO LEN BASICALLY THAT'S OF THE L. A. POP PROGRAM A LARGE COMPONENT. COOL SYSTEMS WILL BE FOCUSED ON. THE AUDITS AND WHAT USED TO BE BROUGHT BROKERS NEED TO BE MAINTAINED. AND HOW THOSE AUDITS WILL BE. CONDUCTED BOB THE OTHER. BOB ALSO THAT WE'VE HEARD THROUGH THIS WORKGROUP IS RELATED TO THE TIGHTENING OF THOSE OUTLETS DEFINITELY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A THREE YEAR TIMELINE IS NOT IDEAL. IN TERMS OF RECORD RETENTION AND MAINTAINING THOSE DOCUMENTS. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT OFF PROGRAM. AND THEN ALLOWS DHS TO ADDITIONAL YEARS TO. CIRCLE BACK AND COMPLETE THOSE AUDITS SO THAT IS- KIND OF WORTH THE TIME LINE ORIGINATES FROM BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OR MEMBERS. THANK YOU I WANNA KNOW THAT US SUMMER MEDINA HAS JOINED US THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA BUT WHAT LET ME LET ME BACK I'LL JUST A GENERAL QUESTION HOW DOES THIS WORK AT THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL THE SERVICES PROVIDED. WHO ENTERS IS THERE I THIS IS ALL DONE BY MEDICAL CODES ARE SOME BILLING CODES RIGHT MEDICAL BILLING CODES. WHO WHO DOES THIS IS A DOWNLOAD OF. THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL THEY WRITE THIS DOWN ON A LOG AND THEN THEY SUBMITTED TO THE DISTRICT OFFICE AND THEN. THE BILL COMES OUT OF THE DISTRICT OFFICE. YET SO. TO GO BACK AND START AND THEN YOU CAN TIME IF THAT'S OKAY- WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED WITH MOST- SCHOOL SYSTEMS IS THAT TYPICALLY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR SCHOOL SYSTEM WILL. TYPICALLY BUILD UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S REQUIRED TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION THAT- IS. A PART OF BASICALLY CLAIMING THE DOLLARS FOR THESE CODES SO IF THERE IS A SCHOOL BASED STAFF SAY IT'S A- A PSYCHOLOGIST OR A SOCIAL WORKER THAT IS ENGAGING IN SOME BILLABLE ACTIVITY ON A SCHOOL SAY. THERE'S A PROCESS THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL CREATE- AS A AS A MEANS OF BASICALLY GATHERING THAT INFORMATION FROM THAT STAFF MEMBERS SPECIFICALLY. NOW UNDER THAT% THE MOST RECENT SPA AND JAKE UP CAN GO INTO A BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT THIS IT HELPS TO. STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS A BIT IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBER TO LOG THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT- ALLEY A CAN THEN CLAIM- ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT WE- THAT. I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE IS THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS COME IN ALL KINDS OF SHAPES AND SIZES AND SO PRICKLY FOR YOUR SMALLER SCHOOL SYSTEMS- IT MAY NOT MAKE PRACTICAL REASONABLE SENSE FOR THEM TO BUILD THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR CENTRAL OFFICE. RATHER IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERATE TO LOOK TO A REGIONAL OR INTERMEDIARY ENTITY THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SCALE THOSE OPERATIONS. AND ALLOW THE DISTRICT TO PASS A LAW THAT HAPPENING. WE THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF THAT- BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF THE PROPORTION OF DISTRICTS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM THERE IS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GROW AND MANY OF THOSE ARE SMALLER SYSTEMS- WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT JACOB- PLEASE WEIGH IN HERE WITH- SOME OTHER OBSERVATIONS ON. OKAY ALTHOUGH. OVERVIEW OF HOW IT WORKS I THINK- DHS CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH THE L. A. ANY AND SO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. L. YANG MORE GLOBALLY WILL SET UP THOSE PROCESS WITHOUT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT AGAIN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS- WELL I YOU KNOW I SEE ADVERTISERS LEARN MEDICAL BILLING. RIGHT RIGHT MEDICAL BILLING CODING AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING SO I MEAN THIS TELLS ME THAT THIS IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO. RIGHT IF YOU'RE NOT TRAINED IN THIS AND HAVE- THIS VISIT THE SKILL SET NECESSARY TO REFORM THE SECTOR YOU PROBABLY SHOULD BE DOING IT. YEAH I'D PROBABLY CAN'T DO IT RIGHT IS A MAYBE A LITTLE BY THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON. YEAH BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT LIKE. I COULD WALK IN AND JUST. FILL OUT A FORM TO BE DONE. IT DOES TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRAINING AND WITH IT. THANK YOU WITH THAT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU THE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE A QUESTIONS A DOCTOR WOULD. YEAH THANK YOU I I'M JUST I'M JUST NOTE THAT- I THOUGHT- MEDICINE HAVLAT'S AKRON IS. AT THE HEALTH COMMITTEE HAD LOTS ACRONYMS AND THIS IS LIKE A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR ME. SO SO I APPRECIATE THAT- I JUST WHAT I GUESS I WOULD NOTE YOU KNOW FROM A FROM A HEALTHCARE PERSPECTIVE. OF THE WAY YOU BILL MEDICARE NOW IS DIFFERENT WE DON'T. TYPICALLY AS PROVIDERS GET THESE. AUDITS LIKE THIS. WE HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING PAID FOR THE SERVICE UP FRONT. THAT'S THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND SO. SO WE'RE NOT TYPICALLY AUDITED AND THERE'S NOT TYPICALLY CLAWBACKS. BUT JUST BEING PAID SO THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT YSTEM THAN WHAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH. AND I COULD SEE THAT- IN MY OWN OFFICE WHEN WE WERE DOING THIS- IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL TO SAY. EVEN IT WITH THE MOST DILIGENT DOCUMENTATION. THAT THIRTY OR BECAUSE WE MISTER. CROSSING A TEAR DOT IN AND I. THAT'S HOW DIFFICULT THE SYSTEM ITSELF- SO I. I JUST WANTED YOU TO YOUR RIGHT THE TRAINING FOR THIS IS. IS A CHALLENGE IS A CHALLENGE AND- WE ACTUALLY. THE MEDICAL SYSTEM ACTUALLY. AT THAT'S AT SOME POINT DID OFFER AND I DON'T KNOW NOW I'M NOT PRACTICING. TRAINING FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING BILLING FOR SERVICES NOW THIS MAYBE THAT. MAYBE THAT EXIST FOR THIS- FOR THIS PROGRAM I'M NOT AWARE. WHAT MIKE MY QUESTION IS- HOW DID THE WORK GROUP DISCUSS ANY ANYTHING RELATED TO TELEHEALTH AND- OF THE GREATER USE OF TELEHEALTH FOR. PROVIDING THE SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. THANK YOU MEMBER WOULD FOR YOUR QUESTION I'LL I'LL LET T&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt; JUMP IN WITH A KIND OF INITIAL RESPONSE AND THEN. BUT OTHERS TO RESPOND T&lt;c.cyan&gt;. THANK YOU FOR&lt;/c&gt; THE QUESTION- SO I WANT TO JUST TOUCH ON WHAT YOU. YOUR COMMENT. BEFORE I ANSWER QUESTIONS- WHICH IS TO SAY THAT- I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK RECOMMENDATION NUMBER THREE IT TALKS ABOUT SORT OF LEVERAGING ALL OF THE DIFFERENT MEDICAID ACCESS POINTS IN NOT ONLY AND EXCLUSIVELY. THINKING ABOUT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES IN TERMS OF WHAT SCHOOLS CAN BE REIMBURSED THROUGH THE ALLEY ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A DIFFICULT USING THE CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAM TENDS TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS. SO I WILL SAY THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF FOCUS IN THE WORKGROUP ON HOW CAN WE EXPAND PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER TYPES OF ACCESS POINTS. INCLUDING THROUGH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS STANDS IN MANAGED CARE PLANS I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON IT BRIEFLY- AND THEN THE QUESTION ABOUT TELEHEALTH- SO FOLKS TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE BEGINNING. PARTICULARLY OF CLOTHING AND WHEN THERE WAS WHEN THERE WERE CHALLENGES WITH TELEHEALTH. DH CS HAS PUT IN A LOT OF EFFORT INTO LET JACOB RESPOND TO THIS- BUT HAS PUT IN PUT IN A LOT OF EFFORT EARLY ON IN SCALING OUT TELEHEALTH SERVICES. AND SO AS WE SORT OF MOVE THROUGH THE WORKGROUP PROCESS NOTHING RELATED TO TELEHEALTH SORT OF. MADE IT INTO THE FINAL REPORT OR AS A RECOMMENDATION. AND THAT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT DHS WHAT THE GAME GAVE STAND THROUGHOUT THE PAST TWO YEARS SO I'LL LET. AND YOU WANT. TO RESPOND TO THAT. YEAH SO THANKS FOR THE- DOT WOULD AS YOU KNOW WE HAD OUR- PCS THAT ARE TELEHEALTH ONGOING. PROPOSAL THOSE DISCUSSED IN THIS. BOB POLICIES SUCH THAT DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY UNDER THE- CODE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. WE'VE EXTENDED A NUMBER OF TOTAL COAL WITH OUR TELEHEALTH ABILITIES- WE'RE CURRENTLY ENGAGED NONPROFITS WITH STAKEHOLDERS OF. ONE WHAT'S ABILITY SHOULD MOVE. AND TO PROP SPACE- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT- EXTENDING TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITY AS FAR TARGET CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND I'M LOOKING AT HOW COULD WORK IN THE- LA POP TYPE PROGRAM I THINK. THE WE EIGHT CONSIDERATION WITH L. A. PAPPAS IF THE STUDENTS AT HOME RECEIVING. ADDITIONAL SERVICES HOW DOES THE HOW DOES THE TELEHEALTH SERVICE FOLLOW AND SO DEFINITELY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT DON'T HAVE ANY CONCRETE INFORMATION INSTRUCTORS POINT BUT THEY'LL DEFINITELY BE INCLUDED IN. THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WE'RE HAVING AS A- AS A STATE RELATED TO TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGIES. I WOULD JUST AND JUST TO THE CHAIR JUST ONE COMMENT ON THAT I HAD EIGHTY TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SO SOME OF THEM ARE VERY SMALL SO THE IDEA THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH SOME HAVE TO CREATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE HERE. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES IS IT GOING TO WORK AND A LOT OF TIMES THE KIDS AND SOME OF THE SMALLER DISTRICTS HAVE HIGHEST NEEDS. AND ONE OF MY COUNTIES WE HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF ACES IN THE STATE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. AND SO THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO. CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY USE THE- TELEHEALTH FOR SOME OF THESE AS A COMBINATION FOR MULTIPLE DISTRICTS POSSIBLY CERTAINLY AROUND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WOULD BE REALLY REALLY VALUABLE INSTEAD OF REINVENTING THE WHEEL FOR EIGHTY TWO DISTRICTS. SO SO I MIGHT URGE I URGE IN THE FUTURE DCS AND OTHERS TO CONSIDER THAT- CONSIDER THOSE KINDS OF MODELS BECAUSE- OTHERWISE WE LEAVE A WHOLE LOT OF KIDS BEHIND. EIGHTY TO DESTROY. WOW OKAY- MISS WALDRON THAT'S LIKE HUNDRED SOME BOARD THAT'S ALL ACTUALLY IT'S THESE AFTER UNDERSTOOD THIS WATER. THANK YOU IN CHAIR- YOU KNOW DOCTOR WOULD BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT THE KIND OF SIDEWAYS INTO WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK- YEAH MY DISTRICT IS. EXTREMELY RURAL AS YOURS IS AND THERE IS A BIT WITH THE INTERNET BROADBAND IS IN A WOULD BE A LUXURY THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW- OUR SCHOOLS ABLE TO TRANSMIT THEIR DATA AND% INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET OR IS IT STILL ALL DONE BY PAPER- YOU KNOW. WE WOULD DO IT WOULD JUST MENTIONED ABOUT IN THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TRYING TO WORK ON- BETTER COHESION. AS YOU'RE INTEGRATING BETWEEN COUNTY HEALTH PLANS MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER. YOU KNOW ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS. BUT HE WITH THE GOAL OF BETTER COHESION. HOW CAN THIS WHOLE THING BE STREAMLINED I MEAN I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE YOU KNOW IDEAL AND- MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND- YOU KNOW WE WERE AMAZED TO DISCOVER I THINK IT WAS YOUR COMMITTEE A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WHERE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ANNOUNCED TO US THAT. THEY DON'T SET THE RATES. IN SUBSTANCE USE THIS WAS BACK A FEW YEARS AGO. FOR SO EACH COUNTY WAS DIFFERENT SO I'M ASSUMING IN THIS CASE EACH COUNTY IS DIFFERENT HELD THEIR HANDLING OF HOW THEY'RE PROCESSING IT HOW. THEY WORK WITH THE DIFFERENT HEALTH PLANS. I MEAN I I'M JUST ASSUMING THAT. SO WOULD I MEAN BETTER COHESION WOULD BE A GOAL. IS THERE EFFORT OR IS THERE SOME WAY YOU CAN BE STANDARDIZED. SO EVERY COUNTY ISN'T RECREATING THE WHEEL OR YOU KNOW EACH LITTLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF THAT AND IT COULD BE MORE- INTERNET BASED OR YOU KNOW USER FRIENDLY- BECAUSE I THINK IF THE MORE WE CAN STANDARDIZE IT THE MORE WE CAN STREAMLINE THE MORE EFFICIENT THE USE OF FUNDS WILL BE AND THE MORE KIDS CAN GET ACCESS. SO I JUST I ON. THE WITH THAT COME OUT IN THIS IN THIS IN THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT YEAH THANK YOU MEMBER WALDRON AND- ALL ASK MISTER LAMB TO CHIME IN ON THIS ONE AS WELL I THINK THAT. IN PARTICULAR YOU POINTED TO RECOMMENDATION THREE- AND I DO THINK THAT THAT IS A SPACE IN WHICH SOME OF THAT EXPERIMENTATION AND SOME OF THAT- INNOVATION COULD TAKE PLACE TO IN PARTICULAR WHAT YOU'RE- REFERRING TO AND WHAT MEMBER WOULD ALSO REFERENCED WAS- THIS NOTION OF BASICALLY ECONOMIES OF SCALE RIGHT LIKE IT'S INEFFICIENT FOR THE STATE TO INVEST RESOURCES WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH SMALL ENTITIES. THAT ARE HAVING TO BUILD UP INFRASTRUCTURE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THERE ARE ENTITIES- LIKE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OTHER. STATE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE GONE INTO REGIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT COULD PROVIDE SOME OF THAT RISK THAT STRUCTURE AND A RECOMMENDATION THREE AND THAT WAY OFFERS A CHANCE TO REALLY KIND OF STUDY THAT AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO. HOW TO SCALE THAT QUICKLY AND WITH THAT WITH EFFECTIVENESS THE OTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT I WOULD POINT TO HIS RECOMMENDATION TO- AND THAT'S REALLY AROUND SOME OF THE TARGETED TRAINING AND GUIDANCE TO ELEAZAR- WITH THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS YOU ALL KNOW- THERE WERE SEVERAL INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MADE INTO THE SPACE- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S FAIRLY NEW FOR CALIFORNIA WE HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS BEFORE- IN WHICH- THEIR STATE DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING ALONG SIDE. THE MARGIN OF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO BASICALLY OPERATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE VALLEY DOT BOB AND I SMALL. SO IT CREATES A CHANCE FOR AGENCIES LIKE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN. THOSE I'M ON THE GROUND THAT ARE HAVING TO OPERATE THE STRUCTURES. TO CREATE MORE EFFECTIVENESS CREATE MORE EFFICIENCY FROM- THOSE KINDS OF TRAINING AND SUPPORT SO. SO REALLY RECOGNITION TO IN THREE KIND OF HELP TO ADDRESS SOME PART NUMBER WALDRON- PART YOUR QUESTION BUT- MISTER LAMB WHAT WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU. YOU ADD TO THAT. YEAH I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. D. L. A. BOB PROGRAM HAS TRANSITIONED MARC TO- ELECTRONIC BASIS IN THE LAST YEAR TO WHEN NO LONGER REQUIRING PHYSICAL HARM SIGNATURES ON DOCUMENTS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN EASE SOME OF THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS- I WOULD NOTE THAT THE UP THE RUNOFF PROGRAM THEY NOTICE ONE OF OUR OTHER BIG CP PROGRAMS IN THE STATE SO IT IS ALSO CURRENTLY AUDITS COSTS WE'RE LOOKING TO CHANGE THAT IN OUR- OF THIS PART OF OUR KILLING PROPOSAL. BEYOND LOOKING. AT L. A. POP I THINK. WHAT IMPORTANT A WRECK THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE. IS THAT THE ONLY BOXER IS LOOKING FOR PURPOSE TRYING FEDERAL REIMBURSED. FOR SERVICES PROVIDING SCHOOLS BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS TO HOW THAT CAN BE ROLLED OUT ONE OF WHICH AND- PRESS MAINLY IS NOT BOTHERING TO COST. AND SO YOU'LL SEE YOUR IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO SERVICE FOR. AND A FISHERIES WHICH MEANS THOSE THERE IS A BAR BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE WHEREAS OTHER AREAS WHERE IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE. GET REIMBURSED THAT THAT LOWER RATE- UP. IN MY TESTIMONY I'LL GO TO A COUPLE OF INITIATIVES THAT WEREN'T GOOD IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET LIKE ARE LOOKING AT. HOW DO WE INCREASE SCHOOL BASED SERVICES AND REIMBURSEMENT. OF LA BOB AND THROUGH THOSE OPTIONS I THINK. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO STANDARDIZE THE PROCESS AND KIND OF GIVE YOU SOME OF THOSE ADMINISTRATORS. GET AWAY FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN SPECIFIC TO L. A. BACH. SO THIS IS DEFINITELY A TOPIC THAT WE ARE EXPLORING RIGHT BEACH DOESN'T HAVE. A LOT OF A LOT OF FUNDING GOING. TOWARDS IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS I'M STRUGGLING HERE WITH IS IT THE PERSON WHO BILLS THAT NEED TO CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES OR IS THAT THE AUDITOR. THE NEEDS CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES IT OR IS IT SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN BUT WE'LL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION LATER A DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE STRUCTURE AND- I WANT TO GO BACK TO ONE OF THE COMMENTS REGARDING SHARED OWNERSHIP AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE- PLACING THE CHILD AT. THE CENTER I DON'T WANT TO SOLELY TO BE A RESPONSIBILITY OF CDP. BUT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT WITHIN MEDIC CAL WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER FEDERALLY PST T. TO PROVIDE CERTAIN COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. AND WITH THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEED TO THE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. THAT RIGHT NOW IS BEING DONE THROUGH A PATCHWORK OF OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE. COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND OTHER MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND IT REALLY DOES REQUIRE OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION FROM THE STATE AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD. TO HEARING TO FORMALIZE THAT RELATIONSHIP. SO THAT WE CAN ULTIMATELY HELP THE CHILD WHO THAT THE CENTER OF THIS. FOR US TO FOCUS ON THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN BOTH CURRENTLY AND HISTORICALLY LEFT BEHIND. IS A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN DEMONSTRATE. THAT WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND FOCUSING ON DISPARITIES. AND SO I'D LIKE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH TYPES OF AREAS YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON. WHICH SITES OR- LOCALITIES WE BE AT. SINCE IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL OR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. WHERE THERE ARE ADVANTAGES FOR US TO BE PARTNERING WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS ON A COUNTY LEVEL SINCE THEY ULTIMATELY WILL ALSO BE TAKEN CARE. OF THESE CHILDREN WHO BECOME ADULTS LATER ON IN LIFE. THAT I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION. AND SO I'M GRATEFUL THAT- RIGHT NOW WE CAN. ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SHARED OWNERSHIP AND WORK ON- THE CHILDREN WHO ARE AT THE CENTER. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION NEXT REGARDING- HOW WE CAN WORK ON THOSE RELATIONSHIPS NOW. IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME SINCE I TALKED ABOUT BEING IN THE CLASSROOM EARLIER THIS MONDAY I MET WITH MY- COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT THIS WEEK AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND APPRECIATE. ALL THE WORK THAT OUR SUPERINTENDENTS ARE DOING ALL THE WORK THAT OUR EDUCATORS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW TO KEEP. KIDS IN CLASSROOMS WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE STRESS THAT. THOSE IN EDUCATION ARE UNDER AND- THE TIMING OF THIS CONVERSATION BUT WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE IMPORTANCE. THAT THIS CONVERSATION HAS FOR US AS A STATE. AND THAT ULTIMATELY BY HAVING THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW EVEN IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY WE CAN HELP OUT MANY OF THOSE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SO- MY COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT WAS HIGHLIGHTING HOW DIFFICULT THEY ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW JUST KEEPING TEACHERS IN CLASSROOMS. AND- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS WHO ARE SHOWING UP EVERY DAY AND SO I KNOW THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE HARD BUT BY WORKING ON- WE CAN PULL DOWN MORE FEDERAL RESOURCES AND HELP KIDS WHO NEED IT THE MOST AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M GRATEFUL- TO BE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WHO HAS THE NEXT PANEL CAN ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I PROPERTY. THANK YOU DR RANDALL ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL JUST HAS ONE SHORT ONE IS THERE ANY STATE OR STATES THAT WE SHOULD LOOK TO. WHO DO THIS BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA TODAY OF EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS WE DID- LOOK AT A SERIES OF OTHER STATES THAT HAVE BEEN ENGAGING IN THESE ACTIVITIES- ONE OF THE CONSISTENT STATES THAT COMES UP PRICKLY WHEN THINKING ABOUT THIS REGIONAL LYSED INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN- I WILL REMIND THE PANEL THAT THE SIZE OF MICHIGAN ISNO LARGER THAN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES SO OUR- SCALING CHALLENGES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE OF WELL EXCEED THAT OF WHAT WE WERE LOOKING OUT AND OTHER STATES BOB BUT WHEN YOU CREATE THAT EQUIVALENCE ACROSS- STATE LIKE MICHIGAN TO- REGIONS LIKE L. A. COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE- THERE MAY BE SOME- EFFECTIVE PRACTICES THAT COULD BE LEVERAGED- WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE RULES THAT- BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE MINISTRATION DH CS AND CITY OF SET OUT FOR THESE PROGRAMS. RIGHT AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE COULD BE SOME MIX AND MATCH WHERE AND- LIKE IN LA UNIFIED WE DO IT ON THEIR OWN BUT MAYBE A MODOC CETERA- THERE WOULD BE SOME TRI COUNTY EFFORT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR SOME REGIONAL APPROACH TO THANK YOU WITH THAT WILL GO TO- AND PANEL NUMBER TWO. I THANK YOU TO THE- WHAT WEST AT. TWO EIGHTEEN THANK YOU WELL DONE WELL DONE. IN OF THE SECOND. OUR SECOND INCLUDES. FROM THIS. AGENCIES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. BOTH ARE SPEAKING VIA TELECONFERENCE TODAY VIDEO CONFERENCE- FIRST UP IS JACOB LAMB FROM DH CS- FOLLOWED BY DR DANIEL LEVY FROM CD. ARE YOU A RECEIPT WHEN READY WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT FROM THE FROM MISTER LEVITT PROCEED PLEASE. THANK YOU WANT TO ENSURE MEMBERS AAIN MY NAME IS JACOB LAMB I CONSISTENT IF YOU DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING- OR SERVICES. THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT IN THE WORK GROUP FOR THEIR EFFORTS- PUTTING TOGETHER THIS REPORT AND THANK YOU TO BUY STUFF FOR PRESENTED THE WORKGROUP RECOMMENDATIONS- DHS WAS A MEMBER OF THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE IN THIS WORLD DCS PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROGRAMMATIC INFORMATION TO WORK GROUP MEMBERS. PURSUANT TO SB SEVENTY FIVE THE RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REPORTER FOCUSED ON IMPROVING CORONATION AN EXPANSION OF ACCESS TO AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR MEDICAID SERVICES IN A SCHOOL SETTING. RECOMMENDATIONS WERE DEVELOPER GROUP MEMBERS. THE EXCESS RECOGNIZES THAT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CARE IS A POWERFUL TOOL REFUSING HEALTH EQUITY AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHO UNJUSTLY EXPERIENCED A DISPARITIES. IN OUTCOMES SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE ETHNICITY OR FAMILY INCOME. BUILDING UP THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF HEALTH IS A DYNAMIC SOLUTION TO THE INEQUALITIES THAT MANY CHILDREN CALIFORNIA FACED. IN THIS NAME OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS DECSS MADE A NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS THAT AIM TO IMPROVE COORDINATION OF BENEFITS BETWEEN MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND SCHOOL AFFILIATED PROVIDERS. SIMILAR TO THE RECOMMENDATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT THESE INVESTMENTS THE CONGRESS WILL BASED HEALTH CARE BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL BILLING OPTIONS PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS ALI BABA. AND BUILDING ALTERNATIVE AVENUES FOR L. YES TO ACCESS MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT. STARTING WITH L. A. BACH APRIL TWENTY TWENTY CMS APPROVED STATE PLAN AMENDMENT FIFTY INVESTED ZERO TWO ONE WHICH EXPANDED L. A. BOB BY ADDING NEW SERVICE PRACTITIONERS AND SERVICES TO THE PROGRAM. AND EXPAND THE POPULATION COVERAGE MORE PROBABLY INCLUDE ANY CHILD ENROLLED IN MEDI CAL WITH INDIVIDUAL CARE PLAN. DO YOU THESE CHANGES WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM BY EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SERVICES. SOME EXAMPLES OF NEW SERVICES GROUP OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY NUTRITIONAL SERVICES AWESOME EXAMPLES OF NEW PER ACTIVATION ORDERS INCLUDES THE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY ASSISTANTS. PRIOR TO THIS AMENDMENT L. A. BACH WAS FAIRLY NARROW IN ITS SCOPE AND FOCUSED ON CHILDREN WITHOUT A P. R. I. S. S. P. PLAN. OF YOU RECEIVING SERVICES AND SCHOOLS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE BUDGET ACT ALSO INCLUDED A PETITIONS TO EXPAND IMPROVE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CARE BROUGH UP THE BUDGET INCLUDED LIMITADA FOR DHS TO HIRE A CONTRACTOR TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RELATED TO THE STATE I'M NOT. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL FOCUS ON THE EXPANDED BENEFITS THE CHANGE IN ELIGIBILITY AND INCLUDES INFORMATION RELATED TO THE EXPECTED PRACTITIONERS ADDITIONALLY AS MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER TESTIMONY THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL FOCUS ON THE AUDITING PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL BE IMPOSED THAT ARE IMPOSED ON THE SCHOOLS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE- PROGRAM. AS PART OF THIS DO YOU SEE THIS IS WORKING. WITH OUR AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS TEAM TO SEE. WHAT TYPE OF TRAINING WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SCHOOLS AND REACHING OUT TO SCHOOLS AND SEE TO SEE. HOW THAT TRAINING CAN BEST BE ARE DELIVERED TO THOSE. INDIVIDUALS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. MORE BROADLY RELATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DCS SIXTY WAS RECENTLY APPROVED FUNDING TO ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR EVERY YOUNG PERSON HAS ACCESS TO HELP WHEN THEY NEED IT WHERE THEY SPEND THEIR TIME IN SCHOOLS. THIS MEANS TEACHERS AND STAFF FOR TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO NEED HELP DROP IN SERVICES ARE EASILY AVAILABLE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN OR NEAR SCHOOLS CONNECT TO A BROADER NETWORK OF SERVICES SUPPORTED BY. APRIL HEALTH PLANS AND COUNTIES. REALLY WHAT THIS IS FOCUSING ON EXPANDING THE RECESSES SCHOOL BASED FOOTPRINT BEYOND JUST THE ONLY A TOP PROGRAM. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS AROUND ONLY ABOUT. HOW DO WE OPEN UP NEW AVENUES FOR- SCHOOLS AND PLANS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE STUDENTS AND CHILDREN. SO THE ADMINISTRATION HAS WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE TWO FOLLOWING INVESTMENTS. FIRST WE EVER STUDENT BEHAVIOR HEALTH INCENTIVE PROGRAM SO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THREE YEARS FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM IS A MASCARA CENTIPEDES ARTICLE INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERSHIP AND CAPACITY STATEWIDE. FOR SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AT THE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE SMASHED YOUR PLANS. THIS PROPOSAL WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF. TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE STUDENTS RECEIVING PREVENTATIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY SCHOOL AFFILIATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS BY IMPROVING COORDINATION COLLABORATION BETWEEN MASTER PLANS. SCHOOL AFFILIATED PROVIDERS. AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS. THE DEFENSE WILL BE MAY EFFECTIVE THAT MEDICARE REIMBURSED SERVICE PROVIDED CHILDREN USED TO REDUCE HEALTH EQUITY GAPS AFTER SERVICES PROVIDED TO CHILDREN YOUTH LOOKING TRANSITION ARE HOMELESS OR INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. REALLY THIS PROPOSAL IS FOCUSED ON. BUILDING THAT PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS AND THE MANAGED CARE PLAN SO THAT WE GET AWAY FROM THE AUDITING AND COST BASED PRINCIPLES OF THE L. A. BACH PROGRAM. AND SPEAKING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER AROUND WITH COMMENTS. THE SCHOOLS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING A FREE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION TO THEIR STUDENTS BALLER MANAGED CARE PLANS IN CALIFORNIA ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING- HEALTH CARE BENEFITS TO THEIR MEMBERS. SO REALLY THIS PROPOSAL IS LOOKING AT. THAT BREAKING DOWN THE SILOS BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS AND MAKING SUTTER TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND PROVIDING SERVICES IN A COORDINATED FASHION. SO BEYOND THIS PROPOSAL THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET THAT INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL THREE POINT THREE BILLION TO TRANSFER TO TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN YOU. TO AN INNOVATIVE EXPANSION SYSTEM ALL CHILDREN ARE ROUTINELY SCREENED SUPPORTED AND SEARCH FOR MERGING EXISTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ALL CHILDREN YOUTH NOT JUST THOSE IN THE OLD A MEDIC CAL. SPECIFIC TO SCHOOL RULER FOR ITS CONSISTENT WITH SB SEVENTY FIVE THE CHILDREN YOU'VE BEEN HEALTH INITIATIVE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS. BARBARA FIFTY MILLION FOR SCHOOLING TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE CAPACITY INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS PROVIDED DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES TRIBAL ENTITIES SCHOOLS LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTING ONGOING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES ON OR NEAR CAMPUS. OF CBO'S WILL FILL A CRITICAL ROLE CONNECTING PROVIDING REFERRALS FOR HIGHER LEVEL FOLLOW UP SERVICES. WITH THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS. SO BASED ON FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED THROUGH THE SB SEVENTY FIVE PROCESS AND- I'LL BE ROLLING OUT THIS PROPOSAL. THERE ARE NEEDS TO BE CAPACITY BUILT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES IN ORDER FOR ANY- TRANSITION OR IMPLEMENTATION OF EXPANDED SERVICES TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO REALLY THIS BLACK MARKET TWO MILLION DOLLARS IS FOCUSED ON BUILDING THOSE SERVICES. ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL STATEWIDE IS THAT WE HAVE A NETWORK OF PROVIDERS WERE THERE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. TO THESE CHILDREN. BEYOND THAT HUNDRED TWO MILLION FORTY FIVE MILLION OVER THE NEXT YEAR NEXT THREE YEARS WILL BE USED TO BUILD UPON THE EXISTING KHALKHAL CRISIS COUNSELING AD SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS INVESTMENT AND SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. STUDENTS PARENTS AND STAFF WILL BENEFIT FROM TRAINING TOOLS TO ASSIST WITH THEIR MENTAL WELLBEING. AND FINALLY THE LAST COUPLE OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE NOT FINISHED IF I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. IS REQUIRING HEALTH PLANS. NO SOONER THAN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO PROVIDE SCHOOLING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND REIMBURSABLE AFFILIATE PROVIDERS. BASED ON A FEW SCHEDULE ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. SO THIS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS INITIATIVE AGAIN WELL BEYOND THE JUST MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND LOOKING AT ALL. SURE STATEWIDE. PROVIDING A STATEWIDE FEE SCHEDULES THAT SCHOOLS ARE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES. CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR THE SERVICES. OF THE LAST INITIATIVE I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS UCS IS ONGOING MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLAN WITH REPURPOSE YOUR- BOB WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED EVERY PROCUREMENT PROCESS FOR ALL COMMERCIAL MANAGED CARE PLANS THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO EVALUATE ITS EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS. IDENTIFY EXISTING OR NEW EXPECTATIONS FOR PLANS AND THEN ENTER INTO NEW CONTRACTS WITH A NEW OR EXISTING CLIENTS. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS DCS IS ABOUT WAITING TO EXISTING CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. DCS SIX TRUMBULL STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE WITH LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEMBERS INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN OR THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY SERVICE PLAN. THE SEATTLE WORK WITH PLANSON A BUST OPERATIONAL READINESS PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THE PLAN TO MEET THE EXTENSIVE CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS AND DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITY TO FOSTER LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS TO BETTER SERVE OUR MEDICAL MEMBERS. ACS BELIEVES THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS RESULT IN IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL GO INTO EFFECT BEGINNING JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. SO BE ONLY THING. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO READ. THE THESE CHANGES NOT BE SO. ABOUT PARTNERING WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. YES ASSEMBLY FIVE PURPOSE FACILITATE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DHS STD. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED REGULAR CHECK INS BETWEEN LEADERSHIP AND STAFF AT BOTH DEPARTMENTS. AS NOTED IN SOME OF THE MEMBERS COMMENTS. HEALTHCARE IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND TECHNICAL AREA WHICH IS MRRORED IN THE EDUCATION ROUTE. WITHOUT COMBINING EXPERTISE FROM BOTH AREAS WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL MISCHIEF'S THAT I'VE OUTLINED ABOVE. SPECIFICALLY DHS IS WORKING WITH CD ON COLLABORATION ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONTRACT FOR THE ONLY POP EXPANSION. ARTISTIC WITH THE CONTRACT I REFERENCED EARLIER IN MY TESTIMONY- WORKING WITH CD EACH IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS AND PROVIDING EXPERTISE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INCENTIVE ACTIVITIES ON THE STUDENT BEHAVIOR HOLDEN SUCH PROGRAM. YOUR WORKING WITH CITIES COPING TEN ABOUT GUY. WE HAVE BY MONTHLY L. A. BOSTON MEET AND COLLABORATE ON TRAINING PROGRAM UPDATES. AND WE HAVE ONGOING REGULAR CONSULTATION ACROSS DEPARTMENTS ON POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING. ULTIMATELY THE EFFORTS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SB SEVENTY FIVE REPORT HAVING FORMED INSISTED DCS AND DEVELOPING A PRIORITIZING THE ABOVEMENTIONED INITIATIVES. MANY OF THOSE DISCARDED PRO PROPOSALS FALL PROBABLY WITHIN THE RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED WITHIN THE REPORT AND YOU JUST AS EXCITED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND STAKEHOLDERS ON IMPLEMENTING THESE INITIATIVES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- AND IS JUST A COMMA QUICKLY I APPRECIATE YOUR DESIRE TO SEE IT ELEAZAR HAVE BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME OF THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS WHETHER THEY BE IN MEDICAL OR NOT BUT I STILL THINK WE CAN EVADE RECOMMENDATION NUMBER FOUR WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE AUDITING PROCESS I THINK THAT'S KEY HERE YOU NEED TO BE MUCH MORE EDUCATION ON THE AUDITING PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING IS PEOPLE ARE RUNNING TROUBLED IN THE AUDITING PROCESS OR THE RUNNING FROM THE AUDITING PROCESS. AND THAT MEANS NOT PROVIDING SERVICES THEY JUST SHUT DOWN THEIR EFFORTS BECAUSE OF THE AUDITING PROCESS SO WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT SEASON CHANGE THERE- MORE COMMUNICATION MORE EDUCATION ON THE AUDITING PROCESS IS AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FOR WHICH WE SPOKE TO THE LAST PANEL THAT IS KEY- THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ONTO- MISTER DOCTOR DANIEL LEE AND HIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DR LEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY MAY PERCEIVE AN ARTICLE PROBLEM GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS THAT THE DATA LEON TO GET THE SUPERINTENDED OF EQUITY. FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ACT HAD TO TAKE A MOMENT BECAUSE BASED ON YOUR QUESTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE CHANGE ON MY. TOP COMPLIANCE. WHICH WAS HELPFUL. A BIG- IT'S A ONE OF ONE TO DO WITH SORT OF. BACK FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE I AM LIKE I SAID ARENA TO DEPEND. HIM AS I CAN HELP WITH SOMEBODY QUESTIONS- BECAUSE I. THE CHEN REEF HOW ARE WE DO. SO DE TALKING BIT ABOUT- IN HER FOR JAKE OF- SORT OF SOME OF THE POINTS INTO OF PART. SO ONE OF TO SEE OUR- THE- FOR THE STATE. AROUND SB SEVEN FIVE BECAUSE THEY JUMP STARTED TO. LIKE AGENCIES AND I THINK THAT WAS A POOR- REDUCING THE SILENCE I WANNA ALSO CHAMPION R. I. C. AND I. SO FROM SUPERINTENDENT WE ARE WITH THE TODAY- CELL MORTGAGE SHE LED THIS PER- FOR. TO GET TO THIS POINT- WITH THE REPORTS BUT WHAT ARE WE TO HIGH. IS REALLY- SO OF THE POINTS THAT YOU MAY. AND OF HOW TO SWIM ME START WITH THE ALREADY. AND THEN KIND OF GO. I'M NOT ONE OF THE ABOUT THE NOTION OF WHERE WE HADN'T. OF SCHOOL TRANSFORMATION AS A CONTEXT AND THEN THINK ABOUT- SORT OF HAD A MEDICAL BILLING AND SORT OF THIS BEHAVIOR HEALTH INVESTMENT IS. FITTING INTO THE SCHOOL TRANSFORMATION MOVEMENT- THAT WOULD IN AND THEN TALK ABOUT THE PRACTICAL PIECES ONLY UP TO THE MINUTE SOMEBODY SOME REAL QUICK HAIRLIKE AND BULLET POINTS. TO SORT OF HIGHLIGHT THAT SO GETTING TO THE- SORRY. DIDN'T THE- ISSUES AROUND THE AUDIENCE WHEN I WAS WANT TO HIGHLIGHT I THINK YOU SOMETIME HOW. THIS IS IT. AROUND BILLING CHANGES AUDIT IS CHANGES IT'S A COMBINATION AND I THINK THAT'S THE REASON WE NEED TO HAVE CD EITHER PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FIGURE THIS OUT. WHICH I AND I GUESS AS I'M A LICENSE AS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST SO THAT I DO THE MENTAL HEALTH BILL AND SO AND I'M GOING TO THESE AUDITS- THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT IS IT YES WHAT HE- WANNACRY FOR CAN LOOK AT HAVE. YOU NOTE. THEY'RE LOOKING AT IS EVERYTHING SORT OF. ALL THE PEACE OF THE PIE. THAT GO ALONG WITH THEIR SERVICE DELIVERY DAY. WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH SOMEBODY CONGRESO. WITH L. ARE HAVE BEEN DOING THE ALLEY BOB. I'M. IT WOULD BE TO PAY. OF HUMAN. OF HELP YOU SERVE. IS THEY WILL MISS. SOME OF THOSE. L. BUT YOU DO. COME IF YOU MAY ONE. AT THEM AND ELEMENT YOU LOST THAT CLING. SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT IS AND WHAT I'M FAMILIAR IT WE CLASS. ND I USED TO. AUDIT AND HOW TO DESCRIBE IT THE DUP. OF HEALTH CARE SIR. LIKE TABLE TOP ON ITS- IS A LIKE A PREVIEW WE'VE TO GO. YOU YOU OF HAVE. THEIR PRESS. AND SEE. ARE YOU STARTED. THE EDUCATE AROUND ARE THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO. IT TO GET A LOT. TO PRACTICE AND THANK. THAT CRYING. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT. IS THE- CRITICALLY SINCE AT PARTNER WHICH- TO SOME OF THIS WORK. WE HAVE TO LOOK. WITH LED AND UP THE IT WAS OF HOW. HERE THE CREEPING UP. IT ISN'T A SOMEBODY TO BID. IT'S SOMEBODY WHO CAN. CALL AND MANAGE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN AUDITING PROCESSES. THE TIME THAT'S NOT A ONE PERSON TYPE OF JOB THAT SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO OWN THAT SYSTEM IN THAT WORK. SO THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT HOW HOW ARE THE NOTES BEING TAKEN. OUT INFORMATION BE ADAPTED MANY HOW ARE WE CONNECTING THAT TO THE BILLING DOCUMENTS SO. WE NEED TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES RIGHT NOW I THINK THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE BEEN HAVING- SINCE I JOINED IT. SB SEVENTY FIVE CAMPAIGN- IS THAT. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CAPACITY NEEDS ARE LEDS AND THEN IF WE START FROM HERE AND LOOK AT BUILDING THAT FRAMEWORK. THEN IT BILLS INTO THE GUIDANCE THAT WE WANT TO DO WE BILLS INTO. THE SUPPORT WE NEED TO GET IN PLACE TO BUILD IS TO. SORT OF HOW WE ARE ORGANIZING AND REALIZING- REALIGNING. WORK AT C. D. E. RELATED TO A WHOLE CHILD DIVISION THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE. TO IMPOSITIONS TO DEVELOP THAT GUIDANCE IN OFFER THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO LEDS TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY BUT IT ISN'T. JUST ABOUT DOING THE BILL IN ITS ABOUT CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT AND THAT THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN MISSING IN TODAY'S. THIS PUZZLE- I THINK I WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS AS BE SEVENTY FIVE. WORK I ALSO WANT TALK ABOUT IN TERMS. OF THE WHAT DO THAT DO. SIR LOOK LIKE A I KNOW TELL CAME AS A- OPTION. IT JEFF REACHED- BEEN HAVING. WITH OUR RURAL. SCHOOL DISTRICT- PUT THERE'S A PART THOSE WHO BEEN IMPACT BY THE WILDFIRES. I THINK YOU'VE ON THE HEAT IT'S NOT JUST. THE STUDENTS IS THE STAFF YOU KNOW- MEETING WILL ONE SUPERINTENDENT. HER CONCERN IS HE SAYS HE'S NEVER. BEEN IN A POSITION I KNOW SOMEBODY NOTICE ABOUT KEEPING EDUCATORS- IN THE WORK FORCE. WHERE THEY HAVE ADULTS WHO ARE BREAKING DOWN THEY HAVE ADULTS WHO ARE ANGRY IS THAT FOR NOW SHE LIKES. IT THERE AT A BREAKING POINT BECAUSE SOME HAVE LIVED THROUGH SEVERAL WILDFIRES LOST SEVERAL HOMES WE HAVE. EDUCATORS WHO ARE HOMELESS YOU KNOW I HAVE TO LIVE WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES OR- WHEN TEMPORARY HOUSING. SO THIS CREATING DISTRESS BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ALSO ACCESS TO PEER ISSUE IN A RURAL AREA. SO ONE CONVERSATION THAT- I'M HAPPY. IN THE COMMUNICATIONS TEL HELP IS GOING TO BE A COMPLETE FIX BECAUSE SOME COMMUNITIES WANT THAT IN PERSON EXPERIENCE THEY WANT TO BE- BUT I BILL. SO IS LOOKING AT HOW DO WE CREATE THAT ACCESS THE KEY IS. A BILL CAPACITY PARTICULARLY IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT MEANT THEY CAN'T FIX THAT THEMSELVES IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO DO THAT. AND ONE OF THINGS I WANT TO SAY IN TERMS WITH SOMEBODY- MATCHING THE IDEAL OF TELEHEALTH- REQUIREMENTS- THERE IS A BILL I THINK IS I WOULD. CHECK WITH THE STAFF ITSELF AB TWENTY THREE FIFTEEN- THAT REQUIRES US TO DO INCREASE THE REGULATIONS BUT THAT'S IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO SOME OF THAT IS WE HAVE TO FIGURE THAT. WHAT THE PROCESS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT DELIVERY BUT BUT I THINK SOMEBODY MENTION BOARD BEING CONCERNS YOU KNOW SELL AGAIN IS HOW DO WE- SORT OF COBBLED TOGETHER IN THIS SORT OF MOMENT. OF CHANGE IN INVESTMENT AND AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT. CRITICALLY AT THE DEPARTMENT TO HELP US. B. YOU HAVE A CO PAY TO BE A PART- IN THESE KIND OF- BUT I THINK I. SAID IT'S A BIG. AND I'M NOT THE WHAT IS A- US DO. IS FIGURE OUT WHAT ANY OTHER CA. AND ISSUES THERE BUT WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD TO A PART WITH THE TO. OF CARE SERVICES SO I THINK I'M NOT GOING TO- SORT OF REITERATE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT- JACOB MENTION ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS IS. WE'RE PHONE CALL WAY TO PROBLEM SOLVE AND NOW YOU KNOW WE'RE QUICKLY IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF EXTREME CONVERSATION GOT STARTED IT WAS A CONCERN FROM THE FIELD. I RESTART TO THE TEAM OVER DEPARTMENT- SERVICES RECENT WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIND OUT A CREATIVE SOLUTION. BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE CAN GET MORE VACCINE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SCHOOLS ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. AND WE CAN BUILD ONE US WILL BE AFTER DOING. AND I WOULD SAY PROBABLY IN CLOSING. I DON'T THINK IN ABOUT I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT SORT OF ROLLOUT. IS THAT. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE'RE APPROACHING THIS FROM THE SPACE OF. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOL TRANSFORMATION SERVICES ABOUT LEVERAGING A TON OF INVESTMENTS FROM COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. TO UNIVERSAL PRE K. TO THE NUTRITIONAL MEALS PROGRAMS TO EXPAND IT LEARNING- IN ADDITION TO THE COMMITMENT AROUND- SO THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DOLLARS IN HOW WE CAN INCREASE. PREVENTIVE SERVICES THIS IS A SCHOOLS IS ALSO INVESTING AROUND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING WE HAVE TO CHANGE. THE CLIMATE IN THE SPACE OF SCHOOLS SCHOOLS WE'RE ASKING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR DECADES BUT WE DIDN'T KIND OF MITCHELL INVESTMENT TO DO IT. AND SO BUT WE HAVE TO GET THAT BUYING FROM THEM TOO. AND WE ALSO HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO SUSTAIN THIS BECAUSE A LOT OF SYSTEMS. WANT TO BUY INTO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE LONG LASTING AND EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT AS WE TRANSITION. OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC BUT PEOPLE USING THE WORD THAT ISN'T DEMI WE WILL BE LIVING WITH KOBE. YOU KNOW LIKE THE FLU. SO DO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT STATISTICS. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO LOST AT LEAST ONE CARE. GIVER TO GO V. WE DON'T GRIEF. WOULD DEAL WITH THE WHILE. IN THE NEXT WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL OF IN. TAMI GRIEF THAT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE- AS A RULE ARE NOT THESE PRICE. SO THE ONE THAT PIECE IS THAT WOULD HAVE THE CREATIVE. TO BE ABLE TO RISK. TO THE ISSUES IN THE MALL- AND DIDN'T REALLY TALK. THAT AS WE LOOK AT ROLE THAT WILL ALSO WORKING. ON THE STATE OF EDUCATION. TO DO A MENTAL HEALTH REFERRAL- LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS. THE SHOW IS WHAT COMMUNITIES NEED TO SUPPORT FIRST SO WE CAN START REACHING OUT TO THOSE AREAS. AND SO SURPRISE SOME OF IT IS O. ROLL COMMUNITIES- WHO NEED TO GET THE SERVICES UP AND RUNNING FIRST. SO WE CAN START- REALLY. GETTING RESOURCES ON THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO LET'S NOT BE HERE BECAUSE AFTER YOU HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR ATTENTION NOT REALLY. FOR THE INVESTMENT IN THIS WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LEE THAT WILL TURN IT BACK TO THE- ANY. FOR MANY THE PANEL MEMBERS- MISS BURKE. I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST HAVE A COMMENT I WANNA THINK YOU I MEAN. OUR KIDS ARE GOING THROUGH A LOT FROM PANDEMIC WHICH WILL TURN INTO AN ENDEMIC I'M A BELIEVER AND THAT ENDS THE WILDFIRE SITUATION AND- AND YOUR COMMENTS ON THE FACT THAT WHATEVER WE DO WITH MUST BE SUSTAINABLE I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND- I APPRECIATE. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU. AND ONE THING YOU CAN DO YOU BROACH TERMINATED AND- COOLEY CONNECTS US HOW HOW HOW LONG WILL TAKE A THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE. OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND TO BEGIN PROVIDING SUPPORT DALY ACE AND SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT NOW SO- RIGHT NOW IT'S ACTUALLY AND I WANT TO STEP BACK AND SO IF YOU'RE A LARGER VISION WE'RE ACTUALLY CREATING A DIVISION CALLED A WHOLE CHILD TO VISIT SO THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE. ON THE ASPECT OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH BUT WE REALLY FOCUS ON INTEGRATED CARE BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS WE WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WE GOT THIS FOR MY COMMUNITY PARTNERS IS SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS A- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S EVERYBODY THEY DON'T HEAR IT SO THEY THEY WANT THAT EXPLICIT CONCERNS THAT WE LOOKING AT PHYSICAL HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS PART OF THAT WITHIN THAT SAMPLE CHILD DIVISION THIS IS OPPORTUNE TO REALIGN IT DEPARTMENT SO WE'RE BRINGING IN SOME OFFICES THAT SORT OF- COMPLEMENT THE WORK SO WE'RE INCLUDING OUR- WORKAROUND ARE HOMELESS AND FOSTER YOUTH ON THE NET WILL BRING ENTITLE ONE. TO BRING A TITLE FOR BRINGING AND EDUCATION- IN THAT THAT SPEECH SO WE AND ALSO AGREED TO MARRY I'M- OFF TO SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS AN OPPORTUNE. TO SORT OF LEVERGE ALL OF THE RESOURCES- IN ADDITION TO BEHAVIOR HEALTH SO THE PLAN IS- TO HAVE WILL BE THE DEADLINE SO WE LOOK IN A GOING TO PROCESS A BRING ON A DIRECTOR AND WE'RE HIRING THE SCHOOL NURSE CONSULTANT I KNOW THE FIELD IS INTERESTED IN GETTING THAT ONE IN PLACE. ALONG WITH THEM WE HAVE A MEDICAL BILLER SO THOSE WOULD BE THE TO- COORDINATOR TO SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP SPECIFICALLY WITH THE ISSUE AROUND BILLION GUIDANCE AND EVEN HELP SUPPORT THEIR AUDITING CONVERSATION. GREAT THANK YOU AND AGAIN THE OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH WAS CREATED THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SEVEN POSITIONS. AND THAT IS TO GIVE REALLY- SCHOOL DISTRICTS GUIDANCE SOME HELP AS WE MOVE TO FOR IN SOME AREAS THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MODEL WHICH WHERE THEY PROVIDE MANY MORE SERVICES THAN JUST ACADEMIC AND I KNOW OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND HAS BEEN A HUGE PROPONENT OF THAT. AND HAS BEEN A CHAMPION. FOR THESE EFFORTS TO HAPPEN YEAH SO THANK YOU- TO THE SUPER AND- DID I SEE A QUESTION DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU UP WITH AN HEALTHCARE. REACHED APPLY PROGRAM CALLED HOLD PER CARE WE RAN THROUGH MULTIPLE. AND THROUGH THAT DEMONSTRATE PROJECT WE SHOWED THE- THERE WERE FOR. WE COULD WHEN YOU DID. SERVICE REALLY FOLK ON THE WHOLE FIRST IT SEEMS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW WITH HOLD CHILD LENDS ITSELF TO THAT SIMILAR DISCUSSION AND FOR US AS A STATE TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND AGAIN I'LL FOCUS AGAIN CERTAIN COUNTIES. WHERE WE MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE WITHIN IT AND LOOK AT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND REALLY LEAN INTO. BOTH THE ONLY A BOX BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE S. M. A. AS- SCHOOL BASED MEDICAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES PROGRAM AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN HELP OUR ONLY A IS. NOT TO BE PULLING DOWN FEDERAL RESOURCES BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO AND ASK A QUESTION OF JACOB LAMB WITH AND DH CS BECAUSE I WANT TO FOCUS ON BOTH THE STUDENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THAT YOU MENTIONED BECAUSE THERE'S BOTH FOUR HUNDRED MILLION OVER THREE YEARS FOR THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LOOK TOWARDS THE DEMONSTRATION SITES THAT WE WOULD WANT TO BUILD UP IN THE SPECIFIC AREAS AND SEE IF WE COULD FOCUS SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS TOWARDS THOSE DEMONSTRATION SITES AS A WAY TO BUILD UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCENTIVIZE COMMUNITIES. TO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE. IN BUILDING THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS. FIVE FOR THE THERE'S BETH NOT FOR. THERE FOR THOSE- COMMITTEE. COMPANY OF LOS PROGRAMS TO WORK IN TANDEM IN A SPECIFIC SCHOOL SITES. AGAIN I'LL JUST NOTE THAT THE HERO INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS REALLY PROVIDING INCENTIVE DOLLARS TO MANAGED CARE PLANS WHICH WILL THEN PARTNER WITH THE ALWAYS ON THE COUNTIES. OF THE GRANT PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON THOSE DIRECT GRANTS DIRECTLY TO THE SCHOOL DIRECTLY TO THOSE PROVIDERS TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY SO THERE CERTAINLY IS. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A- PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THOSE TWO PROGRAMS TO. IMPROVE THIS EXPERTS AT THOSE SITES. I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW WITH MY STAFF BUT ON PAGE TWO OF THE AGENDA THERE'S A DISCUSSION OF THE- DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN THE HEALTH PLANS BUT I THINK THERE'S REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO FOCUS ON. AND LOOK TOWARDS CREATING SPECIFIC DEMONSTRATION SITES OKAY- I'LL I'LL WEAR MY HEART ON THE SLEEVE BUT IF YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK ANYWHERE HERE IN OUR STATE. AND SO HOW WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS ARE IMPORTANT IS HOW WE ACTUALLY GET TO TOWARDS EQUITY. BUT I WANT TO COME BACK TO WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT REGARDING THE SCHOOL BASED FEE SCHEDULE THAT'S NOW STATE BY. AS I BELIEVE THAT'S IMPERATIVE FOR US TO IMPLEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PULL DOWN THE MOST AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT AND JUST WANT TO. THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR GETTING THAT DONE THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. GREAT ANY FOR COMMENT FROM MANY OTHER. MEMBERS NOW WITH THAT- THANK YOU- JACOB LAMB AND THANK YOU DOCTOR LE FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS I WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. AND OUR NEXT PANEL INCLUDES EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS WHO WILL BE JOINING US REMOTELY- THE FIRST IS DR MARIANNE TO WANT SUPERINTEND OF THE SANTA CLARA. COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM DR RAY VARGAS CARVAJAL FROM THE DOWNEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THEN DR LORETTA WHAT'S IN OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS. SO I ALWAYS START WITH DR MERION TO ONE AND SHE IS FROM THE SANTA CLARA SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE CAN YOU I HEAR MY SOUND OKAY TODAY. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU FINE GOOD. THANK YOU I'M DOCTOR MERION TO ONE THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMISSIONING THIS IMPORTANT REPORT. FOR ALMOST A DECADE THERE'S BEEN A GROWING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AMONG CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WHICH HAS GROWN WORSE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IN THE LAST YEAR INTENTIONAL SELF HARM AMONG THIRTEEN TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS INCREASED BY NINETY ONE PERCENT. OVERDOSES INCREASED BY DEPRESSIVE DISORDER INCREASED BY EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT. WE'VE ALSO SEEN AN EXTREMELY TROUBLING INCREASED AND STUDENT SUICIDES. WELL SEVERAL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT COULD IMPACT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS I'D LIKE TO DEVOTE THE MAJORITY OF MY COMMENTS TO RECOMMENDATION FOR B. WHICHURGES THE LEGISLATURE TO REVISE THE LDA BOB OUT OF PROCESS. EVERY YEAR SCHOOLS LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ALLEY A POP ARTISTS. NOT BECAUSE THE AUDITORS ALLEGE THAT SERVICES WERE PROVIDED ARE COVERED. BUT BECAUSE AUDITORS DENY CLAIMS FOR REASONS THAT FROM OUR SCHOOLS PERSPECTIVE PERSPECTIVE SEEM ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS. 75% OF THE ALLEY A BOB CLAIMS. HAVE SOME. THIS LEVEL OF DISALLOWANCE IS EXTREMELY ABNORMAL AND DOES NOT HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER STATE. D. IS AN ANALOGY FOR MY DAYS AS A TEACHER IF I HAD 75% OF MY STUDENTS FAIL TO PASS THE SAME TEST OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I WOULD FIND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE TESTER MY TEACHING AND NOT MY STUDENTS. WHAT D. H. SIX C. S. IS REQUIRED TO AUDIT THE PROGRAM KNOW WHETHER STATE DOES IT THE WAY CALIFORNIA DOES. REVISING I'LL BE A BY PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR TWO REASONS FIRST THE ALLEY A BOB PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY SOURCE OF SUSTAINABLE FUNDING THAT SCHOOLS CAN DIRECTLY ACCESS TO HELP PAY FOR IMPORTANT HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED TO STUDENTS. A LACK OF SUSTAINABLE FUNDING IS THE CHIEF LIMITATION THAT SCHOOL SPACE WHICH TRYING TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH AN UPGRADED AND MEANINGFUL BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES. AND WHEN SERVICES ARE HEAVILY FUNDED THROUGH ONE TIME FUNDS AND GRANTS AND COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS SCHOOLS EXPERIENCE CONSTANT STAFF TURNOVER STAFF SHORTAGES AND A LACK OF SUSTAINED INFRASTRUCTURE. SECOND THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THAT ALLEY A BOP AUDIT ISSUES ARE THE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO REASONS THAT NEARLY HALF OF ELEAZAR DO NOT RECEIVE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT. IN FACT THOUSANDS OF COUNTY OFFICES AND DISTRICTS HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE ALLEY A BOB PROGRAM OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. HE CUTS AUDITORS HAVE JUST ALLOWED 75% 290% OF THEIR CLAIMS AND REFUSED TO HELP THEM CORRECT THE REASONS FOR THE DISALLOWANCE AS- THIS ALLOWANCES AND OTHER STATES RANGE FROM FIVE TO TEN PERCENT. AND IN OTHER STATES THE FUNDS ARE NOT TAKEN BACK FROM SCHOOLS FOR SUCH DIS ALLOWANCES RATHER THEY WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE SCHOOLS TO FIX ANY CLEANING AS YEARS. SCHOOLS ARE TRUSTED HUBS IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND ARE EXTENSIBILITY AND CENTRALITY TO THE LIVES OF CHILDREN MAKE THEM THE IDEAL LOCATION FOR CENTERS OF WELLNESS AND HOLDS ALL THE PRODUCTS. DECADES OF RESEARCH PROVE THAT STUDENTS ARE TEN TO TWENTY ONE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IF THEY ARE PROVIDED IN OUR SCHOOLS. HOWEVER AT THE ALLEY A POP AUDITS ARE NOT CORRECTED SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND THE MEANINGFUL AND SUSTAINABLE WAY. EVEN WITH ALL THE STATE INVESTMENTS BEING MADE CURRENTLY. IN ADDITION TO RECOMMENDATION FOR BEING I'D ALSO LIKE TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATION FIVE A- WHICH PROPOSES IDENTIFYING A WAY TO PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITHOUT A DIAGNOSIS. OVERWHELMING RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT THE DIAGNOSIS REQUIREMENT IS ANOTHER ONE OF THE CHIEF BARRIERS TO SERVICE ESPECIALLY FOR OUR YOUNGER CHILDREN. FINALLY I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE WHICH WILL REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO REIMBURSE SCHOOLS FOR PROVIDING COVERED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF NETWORK STATUS OR PRE AUTHORIZATION. I URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE STATUTE. TO ENSURE THAT THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS DEVELOPED BY T. H. THE S. HONOR THE GOAL. TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE INCREASED ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE AND MUCH NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED IN A TRUSTED SETTING OUR SCHOOLS. I WANT TO CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS TODAY BY SAYING THAT I AM HOPEFUL AND GRATEFUL. IF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT ARE ENACTED AND THE CHILDREN YET AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IS IMPLEMENTED AS DESIGNED STUDENTS WILL EXPERIENCE A DIRECT INCREASE IN ACCESS TO SERVICES AND EARLY INTERVENTIONS AND IMPROVEMENT AT SCHOOL CULTURE. IMPROVED ACADEMIC OUTCOMES A REDUCTION IN SELF HARM INDIA'S AND AN INCREASE IN OVERALL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELLNESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR DOING THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY POINTED PRESENTATION. AND FOR COMING UP WITH THE SOLUTION AGAIN WE KEEP COMING BACK TO RECOMMENDATION NUMBER FOUR WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO TO DOCTOR RAY VARGAS KERR HALL FROM THE DOWNEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. HI GOOD MORNING- CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME OKAY. WE CAN HEAR YOU FINE SIR. THANK YOU SO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY FOR THE COLLABORATION ON THE CRITICAL TOPIC OF INCREASING AND IMPROVING STUDENT ACCESS TO SCHOOL BASED SERVICES INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE WORK MEMBERS FOR THEIR INSIGHT THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION AND WORK THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE TWO YEARS THAT WE MATT AS THE WORKGROUP. IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT OUR WORK HAS BEGUN THE MUCH NEEDED IMPROVEMENT OF THE SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS THE WORK WE HAVE DONE IN OUR WORKER IS A GOOD START AND ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS ADAPT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. WE SERVE. THE WORKER DISK AND DEVELOPER. THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS FOR OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES BUT INVOLVED SEVERAL AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS AT THE STATE LEVEL. THIS IS NO EASY TASK HOWEVER WITH THE FACILITATION AND GUIDANCE FROM THE WEST AT TEAM I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE STARTED IMPROVING. ACCESS TO SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN ADDITION THE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ADDRESS SOME OF THE NEEDS AND CHALLENGES THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. FACE WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE MEDIC HELP REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS. SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDATION TO RELATED TO THE LOCAL AGENCY TRAINING AND GUIDANCE ALL CALLS AND INCENTIVIZES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN AGENCIES AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STUDENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- INITIATIVE PROGRAM. WHICH INCENTIVIZES THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE EARLY EIGHTIES AND MANAGED CARE PLANS INCLUDING COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH MARKETS. THIS RECOMMENDATION SPEAKS TO THE NECESSITY TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AS A SOCIETY AND COMMUNITY. AND MOVE AWAY FROM ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND SILOS AND ISOLATION. AS A CREDENTIAL SCHOOL TO. AND ADMINISTRATOR I WOULD ALSO% RECOMMEND THAT THE PARTNERSHIPS BE EQUAL IN NATURE AND ALLOW FOR EXISTING SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS. SUCH AS SCHOOL COUNSELORS SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS AND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION ON HOW TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE THE COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIPS. ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS RECOMMENDATION FOR RELATED TO THE L. A. B. O. P. AUDIT PROCESS AND- AS A AS A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR COORDINATOR FOR BOTH THE ASK MA AND L. E. B. O. P. PROGRAMS I DOWNEY UNIFIED. I HAVE OVERSEEN THE AUDITS PROCESS MANDATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE RECOMMENDATION ALLOWS FOR THE MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AUDIT AND INVESTIGATION DIVISION TO THE DISTRICTS. DURING THE AUDIT PROCESS I RELIED ON CRITICAL PARTNERSHIPS TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE THE PLETHORA OF AUDIT REQUIREMENTS THE FIRST PARTNERSHIP WAS THE WITH THE AUDIT AND INVESTIGATION DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE PARTNERSHIP ALLOWED ME TO UNDERSTAND AND CLARIFY THE EXPECTATIONS FROM THE AUDITOR AND THIS PARTNERSHIP ALSO PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM THE AUDITOR ON SCHOOL PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO SPECIAL EDUCATION AND THE PROVISION. AND DOCUMENTATION OF SERVICES. THE SECOND CREDIT PARTNERS THAT I RELIED ON DURING THE AUDIT PROCESS WAS BETWEEN THE DISTRICTS FISCAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS AND ME. THIS STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP ALLOW FOR CLARIFYING INFORMATION TO BE EXCHANGED BETWEEN ALL PARTIES REGARDING FISCAL AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE I AM PLEASED THAT THIS RECOMMENDATION AS ENUMERATED EXPLICITLY AS PART OF OUR REPORT. I HOPE THAT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE LEDS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON ITS INVESTIGATION DIVISION MORE DISTRICTS WILL BE WILLING TO DEVELOP THE L. E. A. N. B. O. P. AND HAS NOT PROGRAMS WITHOUT FEAR OF ADVERSE AUDIT FINDINGS. ALONG WITH THE FOURTH RECOMMENDATION I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND CONSIDERING INCREASE FUNDING TO DEVELOP CAPACITY WHEN AND WITHIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS WILL JUMP THE FINANCIAL JUST- REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE ALLEY EIGHT BILL P. AND ASK MY PROGRAMS ARE FOLLOWED AND ADHERED TO. IN ADDITION BY INCREASING THE HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE ALLEY LEVEL TRADE MINISTER AND MANAGE THESE PROGRAMS SCHOOL BOARD AND CABINET MEMBERS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO GROW AND EXPAND ON SERVICES. THAT ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS THIS WILL ENSURE THAT STUDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE HIGHER ACCESS TO SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. MY DISTRICT DOWNEY UNIFIED IS MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY AND STRATEGICALLY REMEMBER USER REIMBURSEMENTS FROM BOTH THE L. E. A. D. O. P. AND THAT'S NOT PROGRAMS TO HIRE AND STAFF AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO. SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS SUCH AS SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS. THE TWENTY TWO ADDITIONAL SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS WILL PROVIDE SERVICES TO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND PARTICIPATE IN BOTH THE ALLEY EIGHT BE OKAY PROGRAM AND ASK MARK PROGRAM. THIS WILL ALSO INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENTS THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS AND WILL ALSO ALLOW TO EXPAND OUR SERVICES- AND ALSO. USE INNOVATIVE AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS TO OBSTACLE RESOURCES AND. COORDINATE THE PROGRAM. OVERALL I DO BUT THAT THERE REPORT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE PARENTS CHALLENGE THAT ARE FOR POMPEY BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND DEVELOPING. AND THE L. E. POP AND PROGRAMS. I WOULD WORK THAT AS WE MOVE FOR IN THE INTO ACT. THAT WE CONSIDER AND GUARDIAN PARTNERSHIP RELATED TO PARENT CONSENT AND PARTICIPATION. I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS ON WAYS TO BUILD HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES AND MANAGE THE PROGRAMS ON THE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL AND- I DO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER A DOCTOR IN ARAMBULA FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE WORK I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO. THANK MISTER SCOTT AND INSTEAD WE LOOK FOR THE COORDINATION AND PLANNING OF THIS JOINT HEARING THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL NOW TURN TO- DR LORETTA WHAT'S IN OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY- I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. COMING TOGETHER FOR THIS PROJECT I ALSO WANT TO THANK TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCDONOUGH- BUT DONALD. THE PREFERRED BIDDER SHOULD. LOOK SCOTT ANY. FURTHER EFFORTS TO BRIDGE THE MEDIC HOW DEVICE THAT HAS EXISTED FOR FAR TOO LONG. BETTER CALPERS STUDENT WORKBOOK WORKS MEMBERS WERE AN OUTSTANDING CROSS REPRESENTATION OF LEADERS AND PRACTITIONERS AS A MEMBER OF THISTEAM OR EXPERIENCE A TRULY COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH A KEEN FOCUS ON CREATING AMPLE STRUCTURES WERE CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND YOU. I CREDIT THE WILLINGNESS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO ADDRESS INSTITUTIONAL SILOS AND THE SKILLED FACILITATION OF THE WEST THAT TEAM. ON A FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE CAREFULLY CRAFTED. COST EFFECTIVE AND DOABLE IT'SNOT GOING TO BE EASY BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A REAL GROUNDWORK ALL THAT STARTED WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND THEN THE DETAILS IN REGARDS TO PROVIDING SERVICES FOR. FOLKS LIKE THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHERS CAN'T HAPPEN WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP LIKE DOCTOR LEE SAT. ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPAND ON THE RECOMMENDATION FIVE ACCESS TO PREVENTION SERVICES THIS RECOMMENDATION WAS A BIT OF AN OUT LIAR BUT EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT AS ALL FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK IT WAS SEEN BY THE TEAM. SOMETHING WE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO FORGET. SERVICES THAT MAY NOT BE REIMBURSABLE THROUGH BETTER CAL EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT TO THE OVERALL FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SCHOOLS. AS PREVIOUS SPEAKERS TODAY HAVE SAID THERE'S BEEN AN ALARMING RISE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DUE TO CULVERT NINETEEN AS WELL AS A STARTLING CRY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION IS COST EFFECTIVE. THIS INCLUDES ACTIVITIES SUCH SUCH AS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING LESSONS. POSITIVE SCHOOL CLIMATE. AND STUDENT CHECK IN AND CHECK OUT PROCESS IS TO DETERMINE IF MORE SERVICES ARE NEEDED. CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ORGANIZER PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES WITHIN A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WEAR AND TEAR 180% OF STUDENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE A- PRACTICALLY REACH TO PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. CONSEQUENTLY MEDICAL PROGRAMS SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS A STANDALONE APPROACH TO STUDENT WELLNESS BUT EMBEDDED IN THE FULL SPECTRUM OF SERVICES. THE L. A. POP PROGRAM NOW INCLUDES X. TENSION OF DOLLARS TO GENERAL EDUCATION AND EXPANSION EXPANSION OF ELIGIBLE PROVIDERS AND SERVICES WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN INCREASING SERVICES ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL STUDENTS- PENSION EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE TYPICALLY PERFORMED BY THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. THESE INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE SCHOOL COUNSELORS. PSYCHOLOGIST SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS AND SCHOOL NURSES AND FOR YEARS THAT THEIR CASELOADS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY HIGH IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STATES. RECENTLY CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES COMMENSURATE WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA STATE BUDGET. ARM GOVERNOR NEWSOM DESIGNATED ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO APPROVED STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND LOWER STAFFING RATIOS. OF THESE KEY PROVIDERS THE DIRECT EFFECT OF THIS IS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED NEW SCHOOL ACCOUNTING POSITIONS POSTED THE LAST FOUR MONTHS. IN THE WORK FORCE BY JUST OVER 20% THESE PROFESSIONALS ENTITIES ARE KEY WHETHER THEIR EFFORTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY ARE REIMBURSABLE THEY ARE NOT THE CONTACT THEY ARE ALSO THE CONDUIT TO ENSURING STUDENT ACCESS OTHER MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE. SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND TRAINED TO WORK WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND UNDERSTAND THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE BETTER WHEN RANGE BROADLY ADDRESSING A WIDE RANGE OF PSYCHO SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS. SO WHILE CALIFORNIA MOVES FORWARD TO CAPTURE REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH THE MEDIC HEALTH BILLING PROCESS. WE MUST ALSO AIMS TO REMOTE THEY CONTINUE TO CARE FOR ALL STUDENTS. SCHOOL BASED PROFESSIONALS NO WE CANNOT DO IT ALONE. WE KNOW THAT SYSTEMS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED SO THAT EVERYONE CAN WORK TOGETHER MORE COHESIVELY. MOST IMPORTANTLY BRACE SETTING UP STRUCTURES THAT ARE TRIAGE SERVICES FOR OUR KIDS. IN ORDER FOR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND MANAGED CARE TO THRIVE IN THE SCHOOL SETTING. WE ARE RELIANT UPON SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE TRUSTED MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE A WARM HAND OFF TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRAINED TO PROVIDE MORE INTENSIVE. ONGOING SERVICES. IN OTHER WORDS A SCHOOL CAN HAVE THE BEST SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH PROGRAMS AROUND UTILIZING COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS BUT IF THEY ARE SEEN AS OUTLINED YOURS. ON OR OUTSIDRS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND HAVE NOT GAINED THE TRUST OF STUDENTS UNIT IS OFF OR NOT. FRANKLY I DO NOT SEEK OUT A NEW POSITION WITHOUT ASKING FOR A RECOMMENDATION FROM OTHERS. THIS STEP IS VITAL AND WILL BE REALIZED THROUGH A COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THERE ARE ADEQUATE FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE PERMANENT STAFFING OF SCHOOL NURSES PSYCHOLOGISTS SOCIAL WORKERS AND COUNSELORS. IN CONCLUSION. LAWS ALLOW FOR ELLIE A META CAL TO INCREASE EXPANSION OF REIMBURSABLE SERVICES TO ALLOW FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO REINVEST IN OTHER HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS TO OFFSET THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT DISTRICTS ARE MAKING THROUGH GENERAL FUND DOLLARS AS WE JUST HEARD IN THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER HOW IMPORTANT WAS TO BRING IN THOSE EXTRA SERVICES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES BY USING EXPENSE SO VERY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT WE CAN REALLY DO A LOT WITH THIS. IN ORDER FOR STUDENTS TO ACHIEVE ACADEMICALLY WE MUST BUILD STRONG STUDENT CENTERED POOL SERVICE SCHOOLS WHERE WE KNOW EVERY STUDENTS NAME. THEIR PLACE AND THEIR STORY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ARE DR LORETTA WHAT'S IN AND TO ALL OF PANEL MEMBERS FROM PANEL NUMBER THREE- TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON PANEL NUMBER THREE. ARE SAYING NO SEEING NONE- VERY THOROUGH VERYWELL DONE TO A PANEL NUMBER THREE THANK YOU MUCH. WITH THAT WILL GO TO DOCTOR WHAT WHO'S GOING TO HANDLE- INTRODUCED PANEL NUMBER FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TO THE CHAIR OF FIRST OF ALL WE WILL GO AHEAD WITH OUR INTRODUCTION HERE BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL WE WILL HAVE ON THE PANEL SUSAN HOLT FROM THE FRESNO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. CHRISTINE SOUGHT STONER MERTZ FROM THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES- WHEN NAY A KOOPMANS FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF CALIFORNIA SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISS HOPE. WE'LL HEAR FROM YOU FIRST RIGHT. I'M READY GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT I AM A LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST AND CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL OPERATIONS FOR FRESNO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WE ARE A. COUNTY MIDDLE HEALTH PLAN. SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK DANCER EXCITED TO HEAR THE COMMENTS FROM ALL OF THE SPEAKERS. WE IMPRESSED BY THE WORK RECOMMENDATIONS FOCUSED ON HOW AN EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES SUCH AS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. CAN BE AN IMPORTANT PARTNER IN STUDENT HEALTH AND WELLNESS. IN FACT STATEWIDE 85% OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. ALL THOSE SERVICE UNTIL DEPENDS ON NUMEROUS LOCAL VARIABLES BUT TYPICALLY THOSE DESIGNS FALL INTO OE OF FOUR DIFFERENT SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS THE MOST COMMON OF THOSE MODELS IS THAT SCHOOL STAFF BY EDUCATIONALLY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHEN MENTAL HEALTH IS INCLUDED IN THE STUDENTS I U. P. AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IT SOUNDS STAFF OR CONTRACTED PROVIDERS DELIVER SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THOSE STUDENTS WERE MADDER CAL ELIGIBLE. I LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM HERE IN FRESNO COUNTY DON'T HAVE ALL FOR YOU. THIS IS I BASED ON THAT MOST COMMON MODEL BUT WE HAVE ADDED ADDITIONAL DESIGN ELEMENTS FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AS WELL. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OUR COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS EMBARKED ON A TWO YEAR PLANNING PROCESS. TO CREATE A FULLY INTEGRATED. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAM. TO BRIDGE THE- IT. IN THE CULTURE OF EDUCATION SECTOR AND THE CULTURE AT THE HEALTH SECTOR WE DEVELOPED A CONTRACT AND PROGRAM WITH THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. WHEREBY THEY HAVE BECOME AN ORGANIZATIONAL PROVIDER IN OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT WORK HERE. THE BOLD VISION WAS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS AND FRESNO COUNTY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE. WE ALSO WANTED TO ENSURE THAT ANY STAFF MEMBER WOULD IDENTIFY YOUTH IN NEED AND GET THAT YOUNG PERSON ACCESS TO A MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN QUICKLY. TO THAT END AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR PROGRAM AND THE REQUIRED TRAINING FOR SCHOOL STAFF. JUST TEACHERS BUT ALSO WILL STOP. IT DOESN'T PROFESSIONS INCLUDE AN INTRODUCTION TO TRAUMA STRESS RESILIENCE AND THE TRAUMA INFORMED CLASSROOM. IS-TRAININGS HELP SCHOOL STAFF TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO USE IN DISTRESS IN SUPPORT OF WAYS WITH TOOLS AND RESOURCES. TO DATE OVER THIRTY TWO HUNDRED EDUCATION STAFF HAVE BEEN TRAINED AND THE EVALUATIONS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE. IN TERMS OF SERVICE WE PROVIDE THROUGH THE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORD ALL IN OUR PROGRAM NAME ALL FOR YOU. HIS PRIMARY TARGET POPULATION IN THE MIDDLE HEALTH PLAN IS PERSONS WHO HAVE MEDICARE. BUT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO US WITH OUR EDUCATION PARTNERS TO CREATE A STREAMLINED PROCESS THAT ENSURED NO CAN'T WOULD FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. EVERYTHING OUR DEPARTMENTS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION FUNDING WE WERE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT WAS REFERRED TO OUR PROGRAM CAN RECEIVE AT MINIMUM SCREENING ASSESSMENT AND BRIEF INTERVENTIONS WERE PROGRAM. FOR THOSE YOUTH WHO DO NOT HAVE MEDICAL WE PROVIDE THOSE SHORT TERM SERVICES WELL WE WORK WITH THAT YOU AND OUR FAMILY TO LINK THEM TO ONGOING. CARE THREE THEIR BENEFIT. AND FOR THE USE OF YOU HAVE NOW HEALTH. THROUGH ARE ALL FOR YOU PROGRAM WE PROVIDE THE UNDER BATTLE HOW TREAT. AND THOSE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED AT THEIR SCHOOL SITE IN THE HOME OR ANOTHER COMMUNITY BASED LOCATIONS. IMPORTANTLY THIS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PREFERENCE ABOUT YOUTH AND FAMILY. THE OFFER YOUTH TEAM ALSO WORKS CLOSELY WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF. HEALTH TEAM TO CONNECT YOU WITH OTHER SERVICES IN OUR NETWORK OF CARE SO THAT YOU THOUGHT LINKED TO WHATEVER SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITY EIGHT. ALL OF THE MEDICAL BILLING FOR THE SPECIALTY HEALTH SERVICES ARE FIRST THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. AND MY DEPARTMENT MANAGES THAT BUILDING. WE ARE IN YOUR FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS. PLAN EXCITED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM IS IN ALL THIRTY TWO DISTRICTS ARE VERY LARGE COUNTY WHICH INCLUDES MANY RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS AS WELL AS AN URBAN CORE. AND THERE'S TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SCHOOLS ON BOARD AT THIS TIME THERE ARE EIGHTY FOUR MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS IN TWENTY FOUR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH TEAM MEMBERS WORKING TO SERVE YOU BURKE BROUGH AGED TWENTY TWO THROUGH THIS PARTNERSHIP. AND ALSO IMPORTANTLY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED YEAR ROUND THANK PARENTS OF TIME WHEN THE SCHOOLS AREN'T OPEN BECAUSE WE KNOW MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS DON'T TAKE VACATIONS. I AM CURRENTLY FOR THE EXPERTS AT THE DATA FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE YOU WERE REFERRED TO ARE ALL FOR YOU PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM AND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE YOUTH RECEIVING ONGOING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN CONCLUSION FROM MY COMMENTS I JUST LIKE TO. A FROM A COLLEAGUE OF MINE HERE IN FRESNO COUNTY. WHEN WE DO THIS IMPORTANT CROSS SECTOR WORK SHE REMINDS US THAT IF ANYONE SECTOR. COULD HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEMS OF MENTAL HEALTH. SURELY THEY WOULD HAVE. IT TRULY TAKES ALL OF US PARTNERING TOGETHER TO SUPPORT WELLNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. TO GRATEFUL FOR THAT WORK AT THE WORK GROUP. AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY AND BE STATE DEPARTMENT AGENCIES WHO ARE REALLY LEANING INTO STUDENT WELLNESS. AND INCLUSIVE OF ALL OF THE PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THAT YOU'VE BEEN PART FOR IT. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY. THANK YOU WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO A CRISTINA STONER MERTZ. THANK YOU DEAR OF SHARES O'DONNELL WOOD ARAMBULA AND MCCARTY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE SB WORKGROUP SB SEVENTY FIVE WORKERS RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROVOKE THOUGHTS ON HOW TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE PROPOSALS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT HAS ACCESS TO THESE MUCH NEEDED HEALTH SERVICES- WE ALSO WANT TO THANK DH CS AND CVA FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP. IN PUTTING THIS WORK TOGETHER. CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD FAMILY SERVICES REPRESENTS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SERVING ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES REMEMBER SIR STUDENTS IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE AND A BUILT PARTNERSHIPS WITH ELLIE AS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS TO BRING SERVICES. TO STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH BRAIDING AND BLENDING OF FUNDING. FOR STUDENTS RETURN TO SCHOOL WE'RE SEEING THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AS THEY RETURN AND IN MANY CASES. STUDENTS REMAIN DISENGAGED- AS AS MANY HAVE ALREADY SAID WE'VE GOT TO BE MINDFUL THAT WE MUST ALSO ATTEND TO THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND OF THEIR TEACHERS AND OTHER SCHOOL PERSONNEL HAVE SUFFERED LOSSES. AND HAVE UNMET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS MANIFESTING THEMSELVES NOW- THE HEIGHTENED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND THE EFFECTS OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF SOCIAL ISOLATION ARE REVEALING THEMSELVES. EACH OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED OF EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED BY THE SB SEVEN FIVE WORKGROUP WILL HELP US MOVE FORWARDTOWARDS INTEGRATING HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES INTO SCHOOLS. AND OF COURSE THE URGENCY TO MAKE THESE EFFORTS A PRIORITY ARE REFLECTED IN THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS MADE THROUGH THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PARTICULARLY THE SCHOOL LINKED PARTNERSHIPS WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND HAVE A FEW COMMENTS RELATED TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS ONE TWO FOUR AND FIVE SPECIFICALLY. IT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING THAT ANY IMPLEMENTATION EFFORT RELATED TO SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. MUST PUT EQUITY IN THE CENTER AND USING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THE DISPROPORTIONATE ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR LGBTQ YOUTH AND STUDENTS OF COLOR IS ESSENTIAL. ON RECOMMENDATION ONE TO FORMALIZE STATEWIDE COLLABORATION BETWEEN EDUCATION AND HEALTH SYSTEMS THE IDENTIFIED ACTIONS SEEM TO BE THE RIGHT STEPS WE ARE WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE BOTH DH VS NCD TO HIGHER STAFFING CONSULTANTS WHO HAVE BOTH THE FINANCIAL AND PROGRAMMATIC EXPERTISE AS YOU LOOK. TO BRING THESE SYSTEMS INTO ALIGNMENT. ENSURING THAT PARENTS STUDENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SCHOOL FUNDING SCHOOL SCHOOL COUNSELING PERSONNEL ARE ENGAGED IN THE ADVISORY GROUP WILL HELP TO MAINTAIN A FOCUS ON WHAT SERVICES ARE MOST NEEDED. AND WHICH ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IN ADDRESSING STUDENTS NEEDS. RECOMMENDATION TO TARGETED TRAINING AND GUIDANCE TO LEDS AND HEALTH PLANS ON MAXIMIZING BILLING AND REIMBURSEMENT AND THE EXPANSION OF SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THESE EFFORTS. UNDER TO A WE BELIEVE THAT SOME DEEPER WORK ON HOW THE STATE AGENCIES WORKING WITH BOTH HEALTH PLANS AND ELLIE AS TO DEFINE WHAT CONDITIONS. NEED TO EXIST IN ORDER TO SUPPORT COLLABORATION. THAT WILL RESULT IN EXPANDED SERVICES TO STUDENTS IT IS NECESSARY. THIS SECTION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS CALLS OUT THE CHALLENGES OF THIS EFFORT AND SUGGEST THAT ALL INVOLVED NEED TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE STUDENTS FIRST. BUT WE THINK THAT SOME SPECIFIC ACTIONS SUCH AS INTEGRATED FINANCING DOCUMENTATION AND BILLING APPROACHES SHOULD BE SPELLED OUT IN ORDER TO TAKE REAL AND TANGIBLE ACTION IN THIS AREA. WITHOUT AN AGREED UPON INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ADDRESSES THESE CHALLENGES. IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH FOR US JUST TO BE FOCUSED ON BEING CHILD CENTERED. RECOMMENDATION FOR OUTLINES IMPLEMENTATION FEEDBACK LOOPS AND I KNOW SEVERAL HAVE COMMENTED ON THIS- THE ACTIONS TAKEN UNDER THE RECOMMENDATIONS MUST CLEARLY ADDRESS ELISE CONCERNS THAT PASSED AUDITS HAVE RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF FUNDS. IN FACT. I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT THE L. E. A. B. O. P. ON. DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT IS FUNDED BY THE WITHHOLDING OF MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENTS PAID TO ELLIE AS THE SEEMS PROBLEMATIC TO US AND THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER- USE OF GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. THAT WOULD FURTHER BUILD THE EFFORT UP TOWARDS CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT RATHER THAN A COMPLIANCE APPROACH AND DOCUMENTING AND CLEANING SERVICES. I'M NOT FINALLY RECOMMENDATION FIVE INCREASING ACCESS TO PREVENTION SERVICES IS YET ANOTHER CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION THAT WE SUPPORT DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK WILL BE A FIRST STEP TOWARDS THIS EFFORT. AND THIS RECOMMENDATION ALIGNS WITH CATALANS GOALS OF REDUCING BARRIERS TO CHILDREN ACCESSING CARE EARLY ON THE BROADENING OF PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY TO INCLUDE HOMELESSNESS ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND INVOLVEMENT IN CHILD WELFARE. AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS IT PSTG MEDICAL SERVICES WITH OUT AN INITIAL DIAGNOSIS WILL ASSISTANCE STUDENT ACCESS TO SERVICES. PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL HELP FURTHER THIS RECOMMENDATION GIVEN THEIR WIDE RANGE OF PREVENTION SERVICES SUCH AS FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS THAT CAN BE EMBEDDED IN SCHOOLS. COMMUNITY SCHOOLS INVESTMENT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT THIS RECOMMENDATION. PROBABLY THERE'S TWO AREAS THAT WE THINK HAVE TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AS WE INTEGRATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE ISSUE OF THE WORK FORCE MUST BE ADDRESSED IF WE'RE WE ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL AT IMPLEMENTING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. RETAINING THE CURRENT WORKFORCE AND FINDING WAYS TO EXTEND THE WORK FORCE THROUGH ONLY LICENSED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF AND PEER SUPPORT IS ESSENTIAL. AND WHILE IT WAS NOT THE SCOPE OF THIS WORKGROUP WE MUST ALSO CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON ENSURING THAT THERE'S ALREADY IN ACCESS TO SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES FOR THOSE STUDENTS WITH COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. THERE ARE THERE OFTEN BARRIERS FOR THESE STUDENTS TO ACCESS YOUR AFTER SCHOOL SITES EVEN WHEN THEY MAY NEED IT MOST. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR THOUGHTS. IT RECOMMENDED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO MUCH NEEDED SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WERE GOING NOW GO AHEAD. HEALTH PLANS OF CALIFORNIA. YES GOOD MORNING KAREN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING THIS MORNING AND REALLY APPRECIATED HEARING THE PRESENTATIONS IN THE DISCUSSION THAT ARE IN THE CURRENT ISSUE I MONEY TO MEN CEO. FOR THE LOCAL HEALTH PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA. HE IS THE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE SIXTEEN NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN. THAT SERVE OVER EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED IN MEDI CAL. I WOULD FIFTY PARTICIPATED IN SB SEVENTY FIVE WORKERS AND SINCE THENHAVE BEEN ENGAGED WITH THE ECSTATIC STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO DEVELOP. IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC PROGRAMS WHAT YOU'VE HEARD MENTIONED TODAY AND IS A COMPONENT OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHERA HEALTH INITIATIVES. MY COMMENTS WILL REALLY FOCUS ON CONNECTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT WITH THE SIGNIFICANT BURKE HAD TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET. FIRST THE REPORT INCLUDES SEVERAL KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROVISION OF THE FULL RANGE. OF PREVENTIVE CARE AT SCHOOL. GIVEN THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILL DOLLARS. IN THE BY THAT THE YOU BEHAVIOR HEALTH WITH A- PORTION OF THAT FUNDING SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TO SCHOOL BASED OR SCHOOL LINKED SERVICES. WE BELIEVE ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD PRIORITIZE SUPPORT FOR EXPANDING ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING THE STUDENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET. NOW BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THREE AND THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT. THE FIRST LACC SUPPORTS RECOMMENDATION ONE WHICH RECOMMENDS FORMALIZED COLLABORATION BETWEEN BEATS YES AND HE WHICH HE REALISES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAM ESTABLISHED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. I WOULD NOTE THAT WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE COLLABORATION WITH OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT UNDER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SERVICES AGENCY. THAT HAVE A ROLE IN OVERSEEING. SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAM. WE ALSO SUPPORT. THREE WHICH OUTLINES A METHOD FOR PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS TO EXPAND SERVICES AND LINKAGES. WE BELIEVE STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP AND COORDINATION WITH LOCAL SUPPORT AND TAKEN TO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. AND NOW I CAN FOCUS ON MY REMAINING COMMENT ON RECOMMENDATION FIVE WHICH PERTAINS TO DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK FOR DELIVERY OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE OFFERED WILL BE SETTING. AGAIN FOCUSING MY COMMENT ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PROVIDING SERVICES DIRECTLY AT A SCHOOL SITE THROUGH PROVIDERS EMPLOYED BY THE SCHOOL AN APPROACH THAT MAYBE IF PEOPLE MODEL PERFECT FOR SOME SCHOOL PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT HAVE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY. HOWEVER CONTRACTING WITH MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN COMES WITH FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS. SUCH AS PROVIDER ENROLLMENT AND CREDENTIALING THE MISSION OF CLAIMS OR ENCOUNTERS AND DATA SHARING. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT LEFT AND THEREFORE WE RECOMMEND THAT ANY FRAMEWORK FOR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES ALSO CONSIDER APPROACHES. THAT PROVIDE LINKAGES TO SERVICES THROUGH SCHOOL. SO FOR EXAMPLE EVEN IF THE SCHOOL DOES NOT WILL CAN ONLY END UP BEING THE PROVIDER AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP THERAPY IT CAN PROVIDE SCREENING TESTS SUCH AS ASUS SCREENING OR SCREENING FOR DEPRESSION. AND REFERRALS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THAT STUDENTS CAN GET CONNECTED WITH PROVIDERS THAT CAN DELIVER NEEDED CLINICAL SERVICES. ANOTHER MODEL WOULD BE INVENTING A NAVIGATOR A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER WAS IN A SCHOOL SITE TO PROVIDE THOSE LINKAGES OR A WARM HAND OFF AS. MENTIONED EARLIER. AND ANOTHER APPROACH TO BE A CALL THE SCHOOL SITE HELLO HOW INTEREST. THAT IS CAN RECEIVE SERVICE THAT FROM. AND THE COMMUNITY. ALL THIS SAY WE BELIEVE THEIR SUMMER DIFFERENT. TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO SCHOOL BASED OR SCHOOL. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. BASED ON LOW NEEDS AND INTERESTS. INCLUDING RECOMMEND THE LEAD. LEVERAGE ATHLETES FIVE REPORT OR IN. OF THE HISTORICAL INVESTMENT STUDENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND IF YOUR STATE BUDGET. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME RESOURCES AND COLLABORATION WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THE PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO AHEAD. MR TERRORISTS OKAY- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ARE CURRICULA. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU- FIRST I'M GONNA- THANKS SUSAN HOLD FROM COUNTY- I'M A BIG FAN OF THE ONE YOU'VE TALKED THE DIRECTOR AND THE PROJECT YOU'RE DOING WITH ALL FOR YOU I THINK IT IS A MODEL FOR US TO LOOK TOWARDS WITH FULLY INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAM AND BELIEVE IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR US TO FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN GET ALL STUDENTS ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. SYSTEMS I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP IF I COULD ON YOUR COMMENT REGARDING- ALL WITHIN YOUR ALL FOR YOU AS YOU ARE PROVIDING SERVICES FOR THOSE EVEN WHO AREN'T ON MEDICAID AND WITH THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT PRIVATE INSURANCE HAS PARITY BOTH AN ACCESS AND IN HELPING TO CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF OUR KIDS WITHIN SCHOOLS. AND SO I HOPE THAT THE STATE WILL LOOK TOWARDS PRIVATE INSURANCE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PLAYING AN ACTIVE ROLE IN HELPING US TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AS WE GO FORWARD AS IT'S NOT JUST A MEDICAL ISSUE BUT IT'S A PARITY ISSUE FOR OLD- YOUTH WHO ARE GOING TO BE SEEKING SERVICES. I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND UPLIFT HER COMMENT IF I COULD THAT IF ANY OF US COULD HAVE SOLVED THIS WE WOULD HAVE AND THAT IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER AS I THINK THAT IS A GREAT SUMMATION FOR THE COLLABORATION THAT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR US TO WORK THROUGH AND IMPLEMENT THE CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH% BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AND WHILE MANY OF US CHAMPIONED AND ELEVATED AND KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IT'S- THE IMPLEMENTATION. THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR OUR CHILDREN AND BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE AND COLLABORATION AND WORKING WITH MANY OF THOSE PARTNERS AND SO WANTS TO MAKE SURE TO HIGHLIGHT AND ELEVATE THAT BUT I GOTTA BRING US BACK TO IF I CAN. WHY I BELIEVE THIS IS SOMEONE IMPORTANT FOR. LOCAL AGENCIES TO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE NOT JUST BECAUSE WERE. PLACING THE CHILD AT THE CENTER BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE ABLE TO PULL DOWN FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT. AND THAT FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT WE HEARD CAN GO BACK INTO OTHER HALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU'RE HEARING LOSS IS A STATE INVESTING MONEY INTO THE CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES HERE FOR US TO BE PULLING DOWN FEDERAL RESOURCES AS WELL AND HOPE WERE UTILIZING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AS THE STATE. SO I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THIS PANEL AND BELIEVE THAT THE CONVERSATION WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THESE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES- BUT BELIEVE THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT. CONVERSATION OVERALL- BETWEEN EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE THIS IS INCREDIBLY WONKY AND DETAILED- BUT- THINK THAT WE HAVE STARTED TO- MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND BOTH THE IMPORTANCE AND URGENCY THAT THIS MATTER HAS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION- WILL PROPOSE IN THEIR JANUARY BUDGET- BUT- BELIEVE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE WILL WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTING THE CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AS THAT IS THIS INTERFACE WITH SCHOOL THE HOUSE HEALTH PROGRAMS. THANK YOU FOR A LONG. THANK YOU MISS RAYOS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE ARE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION FIRST AND VERY IMPORTANT I AND A FEW COMMENTS ARE MADE AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THOSE AND THAT WAS THE FIRST THAT WE MUST PUT EQUITY IN THE CENTER AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM DR STONER MERTZ REGARDING THAT ALSO TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE STUDENTS. FIRST AND AS DR ARAMBULA HAS INDICATED THE PARITY TO ACCESS WHEN WE COMPARE THIS TO PRIVATE- HEALTH PLANS PLOT PRIVATE INSURANCE. AT THE OTHER THE LAST COMMENT THAT WAS MADE THAT I THOUGHT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS. AND THAT THE SCHOOLS WANTING TO BE PART OF IT. UNFORTUNATELY WITH THESE AUDITS THAT- THE CHAIR HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THAT WOULD SET SOME OF THE SCHOOLS WON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE. BECAUSE IN THE END THEY- THEY THEY'RE PROVIDING SERVICES THEY THEY FILL OUT THE FORMS THAT ARE NECESSARY. TO GET AN AUDIT AND IS NOW WITHOUT ANY HELP THERE ARE NO ASKED TO RETURN THE MONEY- THAT'S ABSOLUTELY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND I AGREE WITH THE CHAIRS SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THAT. GOING BACK TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD ASK. IF THE OF THE THESE ARE OUR HEALTH FIELD MENTAL HEALTH FIELD- PRESENTERS DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT REGARDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WILL HELP pASPECT OF THIS BUT WITH ANY OTHER ASPECT THAT YOU FEEL WILL MAKE THIS. A BETTER DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO OUR STUDENTS WHO AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER- SHOULD BE FIRST. THANK YOU MISS THANK YOU MISS RADIUS- ANY OTHER MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER DONALD I THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I JUST QUESTION PERMITS KOOPMANS ODD LAST YEAR'S A BLUES LAST YEAR'S BUDGET HAD FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN IT. FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO WORK WITH SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE A SCHOOL BASED SERVICES SO HOW OF. HOW EFFECTIVE WILL BE THAT MONEY WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. ON THE GROUND IN YOUR WORLD. AT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT AND AT PARTICIPATING AND DISCUSSION YEAH AS WE SPEAK WITH THE DEPARTMENTS AND WITH SCHOOLS AND COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. TO WORK ON THE PROGRAM DESIGNS SO I THINK- THE AFFECTED THAT'S OF THAT PROGRAM ON THE GROUND WILL BE DEPENDENT ON- WHAT THAT PROGRAM DESIGNED ALTERNATELY LOOKS LIKE AND- WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM THE LOCAL PLAN BY MEMBERS. IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY BASED ON THE DIVERSITY OF LOCAL MEDIA AND I THINK I NATIONAL OUTREACH IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR THEIR SCHOOL PARTNERS- HAVE ALSO SUPPORTED THAT SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION- AND I THINK I'M HOPING THAT THAT WILL BE CLEAR AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION. WITH THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT- BUT WILL BE REQUIRED. TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT PROGRAM STARTING NEXT YEAR. GREAT OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- AND ACTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE DIRECTED BOTH THAT- MISS KOOPMANS AND MISS HOLD SO- AND YOU CAN ANSWER IN WHICHEVER ORDER- AS LONG AS YOU DON'T TRY TO DO IT AT THE SAME TIME- SO UNDER UNDER THE HEALTH HEALTH BUDGET TRAILER BILL AB ONE THIRTY THREE SCHOOLS WILL EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO BILL PRIVATE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PLANS AND COUNTY MOUNT MENTAL HEALTH PLANS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN- AND WIN THE REQUIREMENT THAT PLANS COVER SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE TO PROVIDERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROVIDER ENROLLMENT DO YOU NEED TO ESTABLISH CONTRACTS OR AMMO USE. OKAY I'LL I'LL START. AND YEAH LYNETTE AND WITH A LOCAL BAND SO. AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THAT AND IT'S EXACTLY SOME OF THE ISSUES THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONING. I KNOW THAT THE REQUIREMENT- IN THE TRAILER BILL. AT REQUIRED REIMBURSEMENT REGARDLESS OF NETWORK PROVIDER STATUS BUT- I THINK YOU KNOW. PART OF THAT THE DAY I THINK IDEALLY THERE WOULD BE CONTACT IN PLACE. HAVING A CONTRACT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THE SERVICE IS GOING TO BE DELIVERED IN A SILO. BUT THE SCHOOLS WOULD BE CONNECTED TO OUR BROADER NETWORK AND OTHER PLACES THAT CHILDREN MIGHT BE RESERVED MEETING CARE. PARTICULARLY TO THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. SO I THINK THAT REALLY SHOULD BE THE GOAL AND NOT THAT THESE ARE SILENT SERVICES AND BETTER JUST BEING BILLED WITHOUT A CONNECTION YOU KIND OF THE BROADER ARRAY OF SERVICES. THAT CAN BE- RECEDING. SO I THINK IT IS WORKING TOWARD IDENTIFYING THE NEED- TO WORK TOWARD CONTRACT. I WOULD JUST PARA RIGHT NOW WITH. EMPLOYMENT HE PLAN I THINK WILL BE. A LOT OF SORT OF. ISSUES AS WORKS. AND WORKING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HISTORICALLY ARE NOT MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS- THAT WILL NEED TO- HAVE CLAIMS AND BILLING SYSTEMS IN PLACE. LEARN HOW TO SUBMIT A CLAIM- THE SHARED DATA- AND A LOT OF THE- INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES AND THEY CATCH ON I THINK ANOTHER- THE ISSUE THAT. I THINK IS WORTH FURTHER DISCUSSION IS PROVIDER TYPE- I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS. THIRD ALIGNMENT TODAY OR THERE'S SOME OVERLAP BUT NOT COMPLETE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN. THE TYPES OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE SERVICES THROUGH THE ALLEY BUILDING PROGRAM. BIRTH OF THOSE PROVIDERS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE SERVICES NOT MODERATE SERVICES AND COVERED BY THE MANAGED CARE PLAN. I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE ISSUES AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WORK OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS- TO WORK. TOWARDS THAT THAT BE GRADUAL. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. ARE YOU TALK ABOUT LIKES US. SOCIAL WORKERS AND MET MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST BECAUSE- THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW BOTH TO PROVIDE. A BILL FOR SERVICES SO AM I MISSING SOMETHING IS THERE SOMETHING SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING. SO I THINK I'M AND THIS IS WHERE IT WOULD THAT THE DEPARTMENT WEATHER NOW WERE INVOLVED THAT HEARING AND CAN BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU I THINK THE PROVIDER HAD THE I MAINLY THINKINGABOUT ARE YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOL COUNSELORS- THEY'RE NOT AUTHORIZED TO. AND DELIVERED AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP THERAPY SO. HERE POINT POSTAL WORKER THAN MSPS AND YES THEY THEY ARE ALLOWABLE FOR BETTER TYPE. OKAY THANK YOU A MISSILE DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING. TO ADD TO THAT TO THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU IN I CAN. THAT MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST. WRITER TYPE I AM HONORED TO BE THERAPY AND- I'M TIMES IN MY CAREER. AND TO THE QUESTIONS MORE SPECIFIC I WANNA ASK THE AT. ON THE COM EARLY TODAY US OFF ABOUT THE CURRENT SORT OF I SHORT WHILE THAT EXISTS. AND THAT THE- FORWARD AS TO MIGHT. TO YOU CHECK REFERS TO AS A TOPIC. IS THAT WE NEED BE INVOLVED FRED TOGETHER BECAUSE EACH THREAD. HAS VALUE AND IMPORTANCE TO THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THE WHOLE SCHOOL CLIMATE. AND SO THE WAY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON THAT HERE IN FRESNO AT WE'RE NOT PERFECT BUT WE ARE EXCITED AND I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE. AT IS THAT WE ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO BLEND OUR FUNDING. WE AT THE ENTRANCE COMMENT I WILL SAY THAT I KNOW THAT THERE IS THAT A BILL I'M PRETTY IF I DON'T. REMEMBER CORRECTLY I THINK IT MIGHT BE EIGHTY FIVE I TO AT WHICH WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE- ISSUES WITH THE PRIVATE INSURANCE CLAIMING. ABOUT WE ARE PILOTING A STRATEGY BUT OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WHERE BY THE PROVIDER WHICH IS OUR COLLEAGUES. IN THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOL. HIRED MY MANAGER FAMILY. CLINICAL SILVA WORKERS ADERET. THEY ARE. TO CLAIM TO THE PRIVATE. COMPANIES FOR SOME YOU. KNOW HAVE AN- PRESS HAVE THEIR SERVICES AT THE SCHOOL. SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN HERE IN THAT TIME TO PERMIT ME TO ATLANTA LET THEM BUT- JUST. THAT AND IT'S COME AND MORE IMPORTANT. THEY DON'T PAY WHAT IT COSTS US TO DO THAT WORK SO THERE'S THAT THERE'S DELTA BEAT WHAT THEY WILL PAY AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS TO PROVIDE FULLY INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN OUR SCHOOLS AND SO WE ARE LEVERAGING MANY FUNDING STREAMS AND I WILL STA LOCALLY BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR MODEL. AND THE DISTRICTS ARE BEGINNING TO CONTRIBUTE AS WELL AND MY COLLEAGUE TRINA FRASER FROM THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOL COULD ANSWER FUTURE QUESTIONS ON THAT AND IN THE DIRECTION OF SUPERINTENDENT GENE VIDAK BUT THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING ALL CAP FUNDS AND AB ONE FOURTEEN SO WE ARE PLANNING FUNDING LOCALLY. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WOULD WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT SUPPORT FROM THE STATE ONE LAST COMMENT ON THAT AT WHAT WOULD BE MOST SUPPORTED TO ASK TO GET US FROM WHERE WE ARE TODAY TO WHERE YOU ALL ENVISIONED US BEING. IS THAT IF WE DON'T DO. COMPETITIVE GRANT. PROCESS THESE. AGAINST OTHER COUNTY. TO SAYS. AND HELP. AND IT IS REAL KIND OF. IT'S REALLY MORE. THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE END GOAL VISION AND WE WORK BACKWARD FROM THAT AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUND IT. I'M SO THAT WOULD BE MY FINAL COMMENT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS I WOULD JUST CLOSE WITH THIS COMMENT A STATE WELCOME TO THE- TWO MEDIC CALLIN MEDICAID BECAUSE- I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PROVIDER THAT FEELS THAT. THEY'RE ADDING THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY COMPENSATED FOR THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE- MANY OF US WHO PROVIDED MEDICAL SERVICES. OF LOST MONEY TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF TAKING CARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST- IN IN DENTISTRY FOR EXAMPLE- REIMBURSEMENT WAS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. OF WHAT MY USUAL CUSTOMARY REASONABLE FEES MY OVERHEAD WAS 72% SO EVERY TIME I SAW A PATIENT. WHICH I ABSOLUTELY- GLADLY DID. IT COST ME MONEY AND SO. SO AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE- ANY RESOURCES AS A PRIVATE PRACTITIONER SO. SO I JUST A WELCOME TO MEDICARE. AND AND- AND IT'S IN AND WHAT I JUST WANNA CLOSE WITH THIS AND I'LL MAKE THIS MY CLOSING STATEMENT TO THE CHAIR- IS THAT- THE- IT'S- I THINK. HE HE NAILED IT WITH THEIR NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS IS HOW WE DO THIS. AND YOU KNOW THROUGH JUST THE IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED TO BILL FOR THE SERVICES AND SO AS I SAID EARLIER. REJECTION OF A CLAIM WAS USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MEDICAL AND THE MEDICAL ENDOF THIS- AUDITS. HAPPEN WITH LARGER ENTITIES. OUT THERE- BUT INDIVIDUAL PRACTITIONERS DON'T USUALLY RICK'S PERRANCE AUDITS LIKE THAT. SO IT'S MORE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET PAID- 75% OF CLIP OF CLAIMS ARE BEING REJECTED. IS- IS APPALLING- AND IT AND IT POINTS TO A HUGE A HUGE DISCONNECT SOMEWHERE TO THE PROCESS. AND SO I DON'T AND- BOY HERE I I'M GONNA I'M GNNA SAY I'M GONNA. SAY WHAT I'M THINKING- WITHOUT KNOWING SOMETHING WHICH IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS. BUT BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. TRY TO DO SOMETHING NEW- I WONDER IF THERE IS A IS AN INNOVATION WAIVER. SOMEWHERE THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT DH CS COULD WORK ON. TO HELP. BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE THE BIGGER WE WANT TO SEE THE OUTCOMES AND RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THEY GETTING THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT. CLUNKY FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION. WE DON'T WANT TO PENALIZE PROVIDERS FROM ACTUALLY DOING THIS WORK. WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE IT AND THEN SEE THE RESULTS AND SO. IF THERE COULD BE A WAY TO REDUCE SOME OF THE RIGIDITY THAT WE SEE WITH- WITH REGULATIONS AROUND- DOTTING THE TEASING CROSS IN THE EYES AND- AND MAKING SURE THE DOCUMENTATION SAYS EXACTLY WHAT IT NEEDS TO SAY. THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL. AND IF THAT IS THE CASE- THE DH CS MIGHT AGREE OR NOT AGREE. I IF COULD POINT US TOWARDS YOU KNOW IF THEY NEED TO FORTY TO DO THAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE OR- OR WHATEVER YOU COULD POINT US IN THE DIRECTION- I THINK. THE PEOPLE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS DíAS TO TODAY THAT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE AND BEING SUCCESSFUL- IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TOOL. AND WE CAN PROVIDE A TOOL PLEASE GIVE US A TOOL AS LONG AS IT'S NOT A HAMMER- BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S ALREADY A HAMMER OUT THERE IT'S CALLED THE AUDIT PROCESS. RECALL LAW WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT BUT BUT ANYWAY- I WAS WANTING TO SHARE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. AND UP I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU MR.

THESE PARTNERSHIPS SHOULD ALSO% PRIORITIZE THOSE CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT ADMINISTERED BY A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION.

GIVEN THE RAPID RATE OF BRAIN AND SOCIO EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE. HHS DH C. S. C. D. N. D. S. S.
