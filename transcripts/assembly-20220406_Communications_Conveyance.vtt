CALIFORNIA CABLE ASSOCIATION WE

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:36.039
ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE NOT

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.507
THAT WERE OPPOSED TO DIGITAL

00:59:37.573 --> 00:59:39.175
EQUITY WE TOTALLY SUPPORT DID

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.810
YOU EQUITY WE'RE WE'RE OPPOSED

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:41.778
TO THE APPROACH THAT THIS BILL

00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:44.280
TAKES SO THERE'S TWO PARTS TO

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.281
THIS BILL SO FIRST IT

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:47.517
ESTABLISHES A RIGHT FOR EVERY

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:49.218
CALIFORNIAN TO HAVE BROADBAND

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:50.353
ACCESS AND IS THAT RIGHT THAT

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.155
SETS A LITIGIOUS FRAMEWORK FOR

00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:54.190
SUING SOMEONE EVERY EVERY EVERY

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:56.259
LAW CENTER PARK THAT YOU

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:57.560
MENTIONED. CALIFORNIANS HAVE

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:58.928
SUED BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:00.496
THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN VIOLATED SO

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:02.065
SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET SUED

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:03.366
ESTABLISHED IN THIS RIGHT NOT

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.367
FROM IT BUT THAT'S A

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:05.234
JURISDICTION OF JUDICIARY

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:06.970
COMMITTEE CELL BUT THAT IS OFF

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.905
TO THE SIDE THE SECOND ISSUE OF

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.974
THIS BILL IS THE DUPLICATE

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.742
DUPLICATIVE PROCESS THAT THE P.

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:13.743
YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.411
ESTABLISHING SOME NEW RULES AND

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:16.913
REGULATIONS FOR BROADBAND

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.348
DEPLOYMENT. WITH THE GOAL OF

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:20.750
LOOKING AT WHY OUR COMMUNITIES-

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.652
MISSED IN BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:25.254
OR MISTER BROADBAND SERVICE AS A

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:28.091
REDLINING IF YOU WILL- THE FCC

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:29.625
HAS JUST OPENED A NEW PROCEEDING

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:31.361
ON REDLINING ISSUE TRYING TO

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:33.229
FIGURE OUT WHY DO CERTAIN

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:34.864
COMMUNITIES LACK BROADBAND

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:36.532
ACCESS OR WHY DO CERTAIN

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:38.701
CONSTITUENCIES LACK ACCESS TO

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.436
BROADBAND FROM AN ADOPTION

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:43.039
STANDPOINT BUT THE PC HAS HAD A

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:44.941
TWO YEAR PRECEDING AND THE

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:46.075
MAKING OF LOOKING AT THESE VERY

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:48.911
SAME QUESTIONS. SO THIS PROPOSAL

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.580
IS KIND OF JUMPING THE GUN OF

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:53.149
THAT RESULTS FROM THOSE TWO

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.717
STUDIES I THINK IT'S A WORTHY

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:55.952
DISCUSSION TO HAVE THOUGH

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:58.187
BECAUSE WE DO WONDER WHY IN

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.056
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THIRTEEN

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:01.858
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:04.193
RIGHT NOW FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.294
THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS ACCORDING TO

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:07.563
THE PC FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.298
THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS LACK

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:13.236
BROADBAND SERVICE AT A SPEED OF

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:14.337
TWENTY FIVE AND THREE. THAT'S

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:15.405
UNFORTUNATE FOR THE HOUSEHOLD I

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.472
THINK COMPLEMENT TO THE CABLE

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:18.641
AND TELCO INDUSTRY FOR REACHING

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:19.976
296% OF HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:21.778
TO HAVE BROADBAND. BUT YET

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.146
THEY'RE STILL ONE POINT NINE

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:24.480
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:26.282
ACCESS TO BROADBAND WHO DON'T

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.817
SIGN UP FOR THAT SERVICE STATE

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.952
THE H. THEY DON'T ADOPT. THAT

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.487
BROADBAND SERVICE SO WHEN WE

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:33.456
LOOK AT DIGITAL ACTIVE EQUITY.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.458
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM THAT

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.260
LAND SO LASHER SIX BILLION

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.995
DOLLARS WAS APPROPRIATED FOR

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.463
BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:41.597
UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGISLATURE

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:43.666
DID NOT WEIGH IN ON HOW THAT

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.202
SHOULD GO IT WAS TO UN SERVED

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:49.238
AREAS OR AREAS FOR COMPETITION.

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:50.573
I WOULD CHALLENGE THAT THAT WAS

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.842
NOT THE BEST DIGITAL EQUITY PLAN

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.177
TO PUT FORWARD YOU DIDN'T PUT

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:56.112
YOUR STAMP ON IT I THINK YOU

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:58.448
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE. WE HAVE

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.415
SOME FUNDS ARE GONNA BE COMING

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:00.983
IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.318
SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS ON TOP OF

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.653
THE ONES THAT WE RECEIVED.

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.154
CALIFORNIA CAN GAIN BOUT TWO

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.756
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:09.892
D. INVESTMENTS- THE I. I. J. A.

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:11.594
D. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:14.697
JOBS ACT. SO ROUGHLY TWO POINT

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:16.065
EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS INCOME IT.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.300
SMARTLY THOUGH THIS TIME THE

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.401
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS STATES

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:19.569
BEFORE YOU RECEIVE THAT MONEY

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:20.837
YOU MUST DEVELOP A DIGITAL

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:23.172
EQUITY PLAN. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:25.074

WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THAT.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.846
BEFORE ANY STEPS GO FORWARD WE

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:32.248
SHOULD HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE. TO

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:34.283
GET THOSE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.351
THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS CONNECTED TO

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.752
GET THOSE ONE POINT NINE MILLION

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.521
HOUSEHOLDS WHO COULD ACCESS

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.257
BROADBAND WHO DON'T THAT WE NEED

01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:43.259
TO FIND OUT WHY THEY DON'T AND

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:45.328
LET'S GET THE- SHARE. ARE SOME-

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:47.430
RACE WE SHE YOUR COMMITMENT TO

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:48.898
ADDRESSING THE DIGITAL EQUITY WE

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:49.932
JUST DON'T THINK THE BILL

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:52.635
ABSTRACTED HERE. DOES THAT WE

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.237
THINK THE BETTER WAYS FOR THE

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:55.538
PRIVATE SECTOR AND GOVERNMENT TO

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.573
PARTNER LASHER WE CARRIED UP

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.942
LEGISLATION BY MR DALY- THAT

LEGISLATION BUT THE OVERSIGHT

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:54.930

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.365

QUESTION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

BE ABLE TO ADDRESS IT. I THINK

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:07.510
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THE

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.078
BILL DOESN'T JUST SAY YOU WON'T

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:10.145
HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.448
BROADBAND. IT SAYS SPECIFICALLY

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.483
TO THE EXTENT TECHNICALLY AND

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.819
ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. SO IF THE

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:17.987
CABLE COMPANY SAYS IT

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:20.556
TECHNICALLY TECHNICALLY AND

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:22.858
ECONOMICALLY IT CANNOT BE DONE.

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:25.294
THEY CAN SHOW THAT. BUT OTHER

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:27.229
THAN THAT WE JUST HAD THE SEVEN

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.497
BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.699
INVESTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO

01:09:30.766 --> 01:09:33.002
THAT WE COULD PROVIDE THIS AND

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:34.770
AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THIS

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.672
SHOULD BE A RIGHT FOR EVERY

01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:38.641
CHILD GOING TO SCHOOL AND FOR

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.843
EVERY HOUSEHOLD THAT NEEDS TO

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.745
CONNECT THROUGH THE INTERNET-

01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:44.480
ANOTHER THING THAT IF I MAY THAT

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:48.717
WAS. THAT WAS MENTIONED IS THE

01:09:48.784 --> 01:09:50.319
FACT THAT TO. WHAT THE C. P. U.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.721
C. WILL BE IS STUPID. IT'S GOING

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:53.889
TO BE COMPLEMENTARY BECAUSE WE

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:54.590
DO HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.225
ACCOUNTABILITY IF WE DON'T HAVE

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:58.294
THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. WHAT WE

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.728

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:15.423
VICE CHAIR FIRST IF HE HAS ANY

01:33:15.489 --> 01:33:17.491
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NO AND

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:19.393
WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS QUESTIONS

OR COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YES

I APPRECIATE YOUR REGULATORY

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:27.668
FRAMEWORK THAT YOU REFER ON THE

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:28.936
SET UP HEARINGS TAKING US VERY

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:44.285
METHODICALLY THROUGH IT.

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:46.153
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND ONE OF

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.822
THE THINGS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:49.190
IS NONE OF MY CITIES ARE TRYING

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:50.825
TO DO A PUBLIC AND YOU KNOW

01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:52.560
BROADBAND RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE

01:33:52.626 --> 01:33:53.627
THE CAPACITY THE CITIES DON'T

01:33:53.694 --> 01:33:55.429
HAVE THE MONEY AND SO WHEN I

01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:57.331
LOOK AT IT- I'M CONCERNED I'M

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:59.066
NOT CONCERNED I'D LIKE TO HEAR

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.068
AN EXPLANATION FOR HOW YOU

01:34:01.135 --> 01:34:01.969
THINK- SOME OF OUR SERVICE

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:03.170
PROVIDERS WILL COME INTO

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:05.139
OCEANSIDE'S SPECIFICALLY THAT'S

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:07.174
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT- WITH

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:08.476
THE TEN YEAR PRICE FREEZE

01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:10.444
ACTIVATE YOU CAUGHT A CAP. THE

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:12.513
CONFERENCE BUT WITH THE TAKING

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.015
OF THE TEN YEAR CAP JUST KNOWING

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:15.349
HOW TECHNOLOGY IN THE LAST TEN

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:17.718
YEARS HAVE ADVANCED IT SEEM AN

01:34:17.785 --> 01:34:19.487
LOOKING AT INFLATION AND SOME

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:22.223
OTHER- ASPECTS IT SEEMS TENURE

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:24.558
SEEMS A VERY LONG TIME TO EXPECT

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:26.060
THAT ANYBODY WOULD FIND THAT

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.995
FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE EVEN WITH

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:29.797
PUBLIC FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:31.265
PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT I THINK I

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:32.900
NEED AN OCEANSIDE CAN YOU WALK

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:34.602
THROUGH YOUR LOGIC OF THE CAP

01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:37.171
AND HOW TO HOW ARE YOU

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:39.640
ACCOUNTING. FOR ON THE INCREASE

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:40.541
GIVEN EITHER TECHNOLOGICAL

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:42.510
INCREASES OUR TECHNOLOGICAL

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:44.879
ADVANCEMENTS OR INFLATION

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:46.213
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.015
ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW ONE ONE

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:50.084
HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR INFLATION IN

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:51.986
THE CAP OVER TEN YEARS IF YOU'RE

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.921
GONNA GO THAT LONG SO I DON'T

01:34:53.988 --> 01:34:54.588
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU GUYS GONNA DO

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:56.424
THAT SOME OF YOU CAN COMMENT ON

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:58.125
THAT PLEASE CERTAINLY FIRST I

01:34:58.192 --> 01:34:59.527
JUST WOULD LIKE TO. EXPRESS THE

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:01.228
HOPE THAT THE INTEREST BY THE

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:03.197
MAJOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:04.698
IN THIS TOPIC IT MAY BE

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:06.033
DEMONSTRATE THEIR INTEREST IN

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.334
PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAMS

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:09.336
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD- PROBABLY

01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:11.272
THREE A THREE HEADED THE FIVE

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:12.640
MAJOR PROVIDERS THAT ACCOUNT

01:35:12.706 --> 01:35:14.041
495% OF THE BRIBE AND SUBSTANCE

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:14.975
HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:17.978
PARTICIPATED IN THE CALIFORNIA

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:19.647
ADVANCED SERVICES FUND OVER THE

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:22.016
PAST DECADE SETTLE I'M- THE CASE

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:24.118
TWELVE. THE MAJOR PROVIDERS-

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:25.686
SECOND OF ALL I JUST WANTED TO

01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:27.455
SAY THAT- THE PC'S EXPERIENCE

01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:28.956
WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDING

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:31.492
THROUGHOUT THE PAST TEN YEARS IS

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:34.028
THAT THE YIELD ON THE INVESTMENT

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:36.230
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY LOW BECAUSE

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:38.399
OF THE LACK OF AFFORDABILITY AND

01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:40.267
MIGHT SAY FORD ABILITY WHAT

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:42.470
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE IS

01:35:42.536 --> 01:35:45.639
NOT THE LOWING ARE YOU ABLE TO

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:50.811
CALL FOR THE. ATP CONTACT THE

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:52.413
PER PEOPLE WHO FALL OUT OF THAT

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.515
TWO HUNDRED POPULAR WHICH IS A

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:55.883
SIX PORTION THERE'S A LOT OF

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:57.585
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T

01:35:57.651 --> 01:35:58.452
QUALIFY FOR LIFE LINER FOR SNAP

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:01.055
SO THAT'S READ THE LOGIC BEHIND

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:01.655
HAVING AN AFFORDABLE PLAN THE

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.691
IDEA BEHIND HAVING THE TENURE IS

01:36:03.757 --> 01:36:05.626
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO FIND A WAY

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:08.195
TO MAKE GOOD USE OF THE FEDERAL

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:10.464
MONEY IN THE INVESTMENT. REALLY

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:11.866
TRYING TO GET THE MOST BANG FOR

01:36:11.932 --> 01:36:14.502
THE BUCK SO- THAT'S THE IDEA BUT

01:36:14.568 --> 01:36:16.871
BASED ON FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT AS

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:18.939
AS YOU SORT OF ALLUDED TO WE

01:36:19.006 --> 01:36:20.641
HAVE INTRODUCED THIS WAIVER

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:22.276
CAPABILITY AND WE HAVE WE HAVE

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:24.278
IN THE PAST UNDER CASF HAVE

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:26.280
PROVIDERS APPLY FOR A WAIVER FOR

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:28.249
THINGS SUCH AS A PRICE FOR A

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:30.451
PRICE CAP- OVER A PERIOD AND

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:32.353
CASF IT'S FOR TWO YEARS BUT

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:34.088
WE'REINCREASING THAT TO TEN SO

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:35.322
THERE ISN'T. AN ABILITY FOR

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:37.424
PROVIDERS TO COME IN AND SAY HEY

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:38.659
YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE SOMETHING

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:40.227
THAT WE'D LIKE TO PROPOSE IN

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:43.097
LIEU OF WHAT YOU HAVE IS A

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:44.598
REQUIREMENT. BUT WHEN I LOOK AT

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:46.600
THE OF. SORRY WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:36:46.667 --> 01:36:47.801
THE AFFORDABILITY IF I COULD TO

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:49.436
THE CHAIR. WE LOOK AT THE FORT

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:50.738
ABILITY. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:53.140
BETWEEN SOMEBODY WHO'S AT 4100%

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:54.975
OF THE FIVE POVERTY LEVEL. AND

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:57.178
SOMEBODY LIKE MAYBE SOME OF MY

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:59.180
NEIGHBORS AN INFINITY. AND YOU

01:36:59.246 --> 01:37:01.248
KNOW WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:03.284
WHEN WE LOOK FOR THE MOST BANG

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:04.451
FOR THE BUCK. THAT WE USED TO

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:05.853
HAVE SOME. CRITERIA THAT YOU'RE

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.087
LOOKING FOR THE AFFORDABILITY

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:08.589
PROGRAM TODAY MISS SAID THAT

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:09.490
THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:11.292
AFFORDABILITY. THAT'S CORRECT

01:37:11.358 --> 01:37:12.459
AFFORDABLE PLAN DOES NOT HAVE

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:14.461
ANY REQUIREMENTS- THE IDEAS

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:16.263
THAT. YOU WOULD HAVE A BASIC

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:17.765
PLAN THAT'S AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.833
REGARDLESS OF INCOME LIMIT-

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:22.036
BASED ON THE- INVESTMENT THAT

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:23.337
WE'RE MAKING IN THE NETWORK

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:25.039
SWITCHES UP TO A 100% OF THE

01:37:25.105 --> 01:37:26.073
NETWORK WERE ESSENTIALLY

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:27.975
PROVIDING. FREE NETWORKS TWO

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:30.177
CARRIERS. SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING

01:37:30.244 --> 01:37:31.312
FOR GOING TO BE PROVIDING YOU

01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:32.479
WITH THIS FREE NETWORK OBVIOUSLY

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:34.982
THERE ARE OPERATING COSTS BUT-

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:35.583
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:37.818
BASIC. STANDARD PLAN THAT PEOPLE

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:39.620
CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF. THE

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.255
ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT AS YOU

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:42.423
WERE JUST SAYING THAT YOU'RE

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:43.857
CONCERNED THAT THREE OF THE FIVE

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:45.659
HAVE NEVER APPLIED FOR CASH THE

01:37:45.726 --> 01:37:46.927
FUNDING. AND IT SEEMS LIKE

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:47.528
YOU'RE CREATING A PLAN WHERE

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:49.330
THOSE THREE OR FIVE. PROBABLY

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:50.831
WON'T EVER APPLY FOR THIS

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:51.832
BECAUSE IF I WERE RUNNING THESE

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:53.334
COMPANIES I WOULDN'T APPLY FOR

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.769
IT. IF I ADDED A YOU KNOW A TWO

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:56.770
YEAR. CAP MAKES SENSE BECAUSE

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:57.504
YOU YOU GENERALLY IN THE

01:37:57.571 --> 01:37:59.373
INDUSTRY CAN PROJECT OUT WHAT

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.108
ARE YOUR COSTS FOR TWO YEARS.

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:03.611
REAPPLY READJUST- AND IF YOU

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:04.845
DON'T HAVE AN INCOME REQUIREMENT

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:06.580
ON IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY

01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:07.781
WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THIS

01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:08.649
PROGRAM SO IF YOU'RE OBJECTIVE

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:10.618
IS TO GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE.

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:12.419
IN THIS 95% THE NETWORK. AND IN

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:14.555
CITIES LIKE MINE WHERE YOU DON'T

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:16.457
HAVE A PUBLIC. OPTION DO YOU SEE

01:38:16.523 --> 01:38:18.659
THE PROBLEM THAT I BASICALLY

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:19.593
THINK. PLACES WITH PUBLIC

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:20.861
OPTIONS WILL HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.

01:38:20.928 --> 01:38:22.062
THE I. S. B. THE SERVICE

01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:23.998
PROVIDERS WILL NOT BUILD OUT IN

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:24.832
OCEANSIDE. AND OCEANSIDE WILL BE

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:26.400
LEFT BEHIND AT OCEANSIDE IS

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:28.502
TYPICALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND. SO I

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:29.770
HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:30.971
THIS IS CONSTRUCTED I REALLY

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:33.374
ENCOURAGE THE PC. TO GO BACK AND

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.908
LOOK AT. SETTING SOME SORT OF

01:38:34.975 --> 01:38:37.411
INCOME AVAILABILITY AROUND THIS.

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:38.979
AND THINKING ABOUT CITIES THAT

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:40.581
DO NOT WILL NOT HAVE A PUBLIC

01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:42.149
OPTION ON MY CITIES WILL EVER

01:38:42.216 --> 01:38:44.451
HAVE A PUBLIC OPTION THAT'S NOT

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:46.320
ANYTHING TO DO- SO. REALLY THINK

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:47.921
ABOUT THAT AND MAYBE CONSIDER A

01:38:47.988 --> 01:38:49.556
FIVE YEAR CAP. RATHER IT RATHER

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:51.525
THAN A TEN YEAR TENURE JUST

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:52.559
SEEMS LIKE. FAR TOO LONG IN THE

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:54.662
FUTURE AND THIS TOO MANY OPTION.

01:38:54.728 --> 01:38:56.030
THIS TOO MUCH UNPREDICTABILITY A

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:57.331
TEN YEAR CAP. THAN  TWO YEAR

01:38:57.398 --> 01:38:59.433
CAP. SO MAYBE YOU NEED TO

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.801
INCREASE OF FROM TWO I TOTALLY

01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:01.568
GET THAT. BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:03.437
THEM YOU KNOW BASICALLY. PUBLIC

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:04.471
FUNDING YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:05.606
PUBLIC BENEFITS I GET. I AGREE

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:07.474
WITH YOU ON THAT CALCULATION. I

01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:08.475
THINK MAYBE YOUR NUMBERS OR

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:10.911
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OFF. AND

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:11.478
REALLY CONSIDER THE PSC. WE

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:13.614
CONSIDER. THE TIME FRAME. AND

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:15.182
ADDING AFFORDABILITY LIMIT.

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:16.417
BECAUSE OTHERWISE I THINK WHAT

01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:18.152
YOU CAN'T SEE IS PEOPLE WHO

01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:19.320
DON'T NEED THE FORD ABILITY.

01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:20.621
WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. AND

01:39:20.688 --> 01:39:22.156
pPEOPLE WHO DO NEED THE

01:39:22.222 --> 01:39:23.123
AFFORDABILITY LIKE IN OCEANSIDE

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:24.291
WON'T GET IT. AND THAT'S

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:25.326
PROBABLY NOT THE OBJECTIVE THAT

01:39:25.392 --> 01:39:26.794
I THINK WE HAS THE LEGISLATURE

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:30.631
HAVE GIVEN- OR THAT I WOULD WANT

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.333
FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU

01:39:32.399 --> 01:39:32.933
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ARE ANY OTHER

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.402
QUESTIONS I. BEFORE IT'S ANOTHER

01:39:35.469 --> 01:39:38.439
TOPIC I DID WANT TO CONCUR WITH

01:39:38.505 --> 01:39:41.642
ASSEMBLY MEMBER- FROM THE SOUTH

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:43.644
BOERNER HORVATH I WANT TO SIT

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:45.512
AROUND WHERE BOERNER HORVATH.

01:39:45.579 --> 01:39:46.780
COULD YOU GET OKAY

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:52.052
BOERNER HORVATH- I D. I TO HAVE

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:53.387
THAT FIRST I GUESS ONE OF THE

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:55.856
QUESTIONS IS DOES THE FEDERAL

01:39:55.923 --> 01:39:57.224
GOVERNMENT REQUIRE THAT

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:59.793
APPLICANTS BE OFFERED A LOW COST

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:03.197
COST PLAN TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD.

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:05.733
THE TREASURY FINAL ROLE- SAYS

01:40:05.799 --> 01:40:06.867
THAT THERE SHOULD BE A LOW COST

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:08.802
PLAN DOESN'T SAY TO EVERY

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:10.504
HOUSEHOLD BUT IT DOES SAY THE

01:40:10.571 --> 01:40:12.840
VAST TO BE OFFERED. BECAUSE MY

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:15.109
CONCERN- AND I'VE EXPRESSED THIS

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:17.244
BEFORE IT IS FOR SOME OF THE

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:21.582
INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE. MOST

01:40:21.648 --> 01:40:23.317
NEEDING THIS PROGRAM THEY MAY

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:25.119
NOT HAVE THE ACCESS TO GET THE

01:40:25.185 --> 01:40:28.288
PROGRAM- OR INFORMATION AND THEN

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:30.624
FOR OTHERS WHO ARE- YOU KNOW

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:32.092
FOLLOWING THESE TYPES OF

01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:33.227
PROGRAMS THEY MAY IN FACT GET

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:37.264
THOSE- BUT I ALSO AGREE WITH THE

01:40:37.331 --> 01:40:39.466
FIVE YEAR I MEAN IN THIS CLIMATE

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:42.569
THAT W ARE WITH INFLATION ALL

01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:45.038
OF THESE THINGS THAT WE SEE AS

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:46.540
FAR AS PRICE CHANGE IN A TEN

01:40:46.607 --> 01:40:48.442
YEAR PRO. AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT

01:40:48.509 --> 01:40:50.711
USING- YOU DID MAKE A CHANGE

01:40:50.778 --> 01:40:53.213
FROM NOT USING FREEZE TO WHAT

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.084
YOU CHANGED IT TO A TO A CAP BUT

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:59.286
I MAY BE A FIVE YEAR REVIEW

01:40:59.353 --> 01:41:02.556
WOULD BE SOMETHING I THINK COULD

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:03.757
BE A LITTLE BIT OF THE MIDDLE

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:05.426
GROUND THERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER P.

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:07.060
I WANT TO JOIN WITH THE OTHER

01:41:07.127 --> 01:41:08.362
MEMBERS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THIS

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:10.664
KIND OF CONCERNED. ABOUT A TAPE

01:41:10.731 --> 01:41:13.300
BUT LITTLE BIT OF A STEP FURTHER

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:14.435
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IF SOME OF

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:19.440
THESE- GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. OUR

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:23.277
ATTEMPT WITH A TEN YEAR AND A

01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:25.612
CAP THAT I THINK IT'S FORTY. I

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:27.548
THINK WE MAY END UP WITH- GOOD

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:30.484
INTENTIONS AND BANKRUPTCIES.

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:32.820
THIS IS REALLY A VERY SERIOUS

01:41:32.886 --> 01:41:34.721
ISSUE AND WE HAVE BEEN HERE NOW

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:36.323
AT LEAST THE SECOND. TIME WE'VE

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:38.158
SAT AND TALKED ABOUT THIS AND

01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:39.426
WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT A- AT A

01:41:39.493 --> 01:41:44.398
RATE. FREEZE CAP FOR TEN YEARS

01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:46.600
THAT'S NUMBER ONE I MEAN NUMBER

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:49.136
TWO I CONCUR WITH THE CONCERN

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:51.205
THAT YOU ARE CREATING A TEMPLATE

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:53.907
WHICH IS A DISINCENTIVE TO THE

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:56.743
VERY PRIVATE SECTOR GROUPS THAT

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:58.645
YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT. AND I

01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:01.248
THINK THAT THE IF THIS IS AN

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:04.218
ARBITRARY NUMBER IT AT BOTH AT

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:09.289
THE RATE M. VIA THE TIME PERIOD-

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:10.924
I THINK THERE'S A GENERAL

01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:12.292
CONSENSUS HERE THAT THIS IS A

01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:14.761
THIS IS AN ONGOING CONCERN. AND

01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:15.996
THIS IS THE SECOND HEARING I'VE

01:42:16.063 --> 01:42:18.932
SAT THROUGH I DON'T SEE ANY FIX

01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:20.300
TO THIS HOW MANY TIMES DO WE

01:42:20.367 --> 01:42:22.035
HAVE TO TELL YOU TO PROBLEM.

01:42:22.102 --> 01:42:23.103
WE'RE JUST HOPING MAYBE THERE

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:24.872
THERE COULD BE SOME GOING BACK

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:26.540
FOR RECONSIDERATION I KNOW THAT

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:28.509
THERE IS A VOTE TOMORROW AND WE-

01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:30.611
WERE KIND OF IN. THIS SCENARIO

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:32.012
WHERE WE ARE WE HAVE THIS

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:34.381
URGENCY WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:36.917
BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO MOVE

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:39.086
FORWARD- IF WE'RE NOT CONFIDENT

01:42:39.152 --> 01:42:41.455
ON SOME OF THE MEASURES. BUT I

01:42:41.522 --> 01:42:43.357
UNDERSTAND THE CONFLICTING

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:46.159
MESSAGES THAT YOU. AND OTHERS

01:42:46.226 --> 01:42:47.961
THAT ARE WORKING ON THIS ARE

01:42:48.028 --> 01:42:50.030
GETTING AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:51.298
BE- YOU KNOW OVERBEARING WE'RE

01:42:51.365 --> 01:42:52.666
JUST TRYING TO SAY WE'RE NOT.

01:42:52.733 --> 01:42:55.335
WHERE WE HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH-

01:42:55.402 --> 01:42:57.204
THE FORTY DOLLAR AND THE TEN

01:42:57.271 --> 01:42:59.873
YEAR- BUT AGAIN I THINK WE'VE

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.542
EXPRESSED THAT SO WE'LL MOVE ON

01:43:01.608 --> 01:43:04.211
TO A QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE OTHER

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:05.779
QUESTIONS REGARDING. WELL I WAS

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:07.281
GONNA HAMMER HAMMER IT HOME

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:09.583
AGAIN I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:11.451
THE OTHER CONCERN ISAROUND THE-

01:43:11.518 --> 01:43:14.054
LONGER TERM INFRASTRUCTURE I IN

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:16.657
THIS WORLD UNLIKE OTHER. OTHER

01:43:16.723 --> 01:43:18.859
AT UTILITIES IT'S CONSTANTLY

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:20.494
DEVELOPING RIGHT WE'VE LIVED IN

01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:22.496
A VERY SHORT TIME. FROM GOING

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:24.698
FROM THREE G. TO FOUR G. TO FIVE

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.500
G. IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF RATE

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:28.135
OF SPEED THAT'S- THAT'S REQUIRED

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:30.203
OR AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AND WHAT

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:31.838
I WOULD HATE TO SEE HAPPEN. IN

01:43:31.905 --> 01:43:33.574
EVEN IN URBAN DISTRICTS LIKE

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:36.710
MINE- IN OAKLAND WHERE WE DON'T

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:39.613
HAVE THE ABILITY TO FOR- THAT

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.948
PRIVATE ENTITIES WHO WANT TO

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:42.916
PARTICIPATE IN THIS TO BE ABLE

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:43.984
TO ACTUALLY INVEST IN THE

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:45.652
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY NEED TO

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:47.554
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT TO. A TO

01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:48.889
PROVIDED SO I DO SEE THAT THERE

01:43:48.956 --> 01:43:51.058
IS KIND OF A LONGER TERM-

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:53.327
CONCERN IT IN TERMS OF ONGOING

01:43:53.393 --> 01:43:55.729
INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE-

01:43:55.796 --> 01:43:57.030
THROUGH A PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:43:57.097 --> 01:43:58.732
PARTNERSHIP AS THIS IS INTENDED

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:00.734
TO BE. A TO BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:02.970
PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:06.206
GRANT PROGRAM IF WE ARE- THAT.

01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:07.741
NOT PROVIDING THE CAPACITY FOR

01:44:07.808 --> 01:44:09.409
THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

01:44:09.476 --> 01:44:11.778
WITHIN. A GIVEN THE LONG TIME

01:44:11.845 --> 01:44:13.513
RANGE THAT WHERE ASSOCIATING

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:16.850
WITH THIS SO I WOULD. HOPE THAT

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.585
WE CONSIDER AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:44:18.652 --> 01:44:20.787
HAVE THEIR BE PARITY BETWEEN.

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:24.191
THIS PROGRAM- AND THAT THAT THE

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:26.560
OTHER PROGRAM THAT HAS A TWO

01:44:26.627 --> 01:44:30.597
YEAR LIMITATION. THANK YOU I

01:44:30.664 --> 01:44:32.933
THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PARTNER

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.837
HERE HORVATH I'LL GET IT TBH

01:44:36.903 --> 01:44:39.206
TASHA. I OF ALL NAMES I AM

01:44:39.272 --> 01:44:41.642
INTERESTED. TO MAKE SOME FURTHER

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:43.877
COMMENTS FIGHTERS- SOMMAIRE

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:45.746
PATTERSON REMINDED ME ONE OF THE

01:44:45.812 --> 01:44:47.347
THINGS WHEN I READ THE PROPOSAL

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:49.016
THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT. IS

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:50.584
THE FOR EXCLUDING SOME OF THE

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:52.185
95% PROVIDERS YOU COULD HAVE

01:44:52.252 --> 01:44:55.088
START UPS THAT COME AND TRY TO

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:55.922
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. ARM BUT

01:44:55.989 --> 01:44:57.457
I REALLY DO THINK WITH A CAP

01:44:57.524 --> 01:45:00.727
OVER TEN YEARS WHAT WHAT I DON'T

01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:03.430
SEE IS A CONTROL FOR THE

01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:05.465
VIABILITY OF THE COMPANY. SO

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:07.234
THAT THEY DON'T GO BANKRUPT

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.568
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:10.270
WOULD BE THE WORST OUTCOME FOR

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:12.205
US IS OF A SMALL COMPANY COMES

01:45:12.272 --> 01:45:13.373
IN. RIGHT AND THE ABSENCE OF THE

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.708
BIG COMPANIES GOING IN SMALL

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:15.575
COMPANY COMES IN ALWAYS

01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:17.944
SUPPORTER SMALL START UPS RIGHT

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:18.578
THAT'S GREAT THAT'S THAT'S GREAT

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:20.113
COME COMPETITION THAT'S FINE.

01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.548
BUT THEY WOULD COME AND THEY

01:45:21.615 --> 01:45:23.450
WOULD BE OVER AMBITIOUS AND WHEN

01:45:23.517 --> 01:45:25.352
THEY ACTUALLY GO FOR THE TEN

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:26.987
YEARS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:28.689
IT SO FIVE YEARS THEN. THEY GO

01:45:28.755 --> 01:45:30.791
BANKRUPT DO WE HAVE A PLAN FOR

01:45:30.857 --> 01:45:31.825
ONE OF THESE COMPANIES TO GET

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:33.927
THE FUNDING GO BANKRUPT WE HAVE.

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:35.696
IS THERE SOME FEEL SAFE THAT IS

01:45:35.762 --> 01:45:40.033
BUILT INTO YOUR PROGRAM. TO

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.134
ACCOUNT FOR THE BANKRUPTCIES

01:45:41.201 --> 01:45:41.768
THAT MAY HAPPEN. WHAT WE'RE NOT

01:45:41.835 --> 01:45:42.602
PLANNING ON COMPANIES GOING

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:44.337
BANKRUPT I TAKE YOUR POINT. THAT

01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:46.473
YOU SHOULD PLAN FOR COMPANIES

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.708
GOING BACK UP WE SHOULD ALWAYS

01:45:47.774 --> 01:45:49.042
PLAN FOR COMPANIES. ESPECIALLY

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:51.178
WITH SO THAT'S MY CONCERN AROUND

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:53.280
THE TEN YEAR CAP AT FORTY

01:45:53.346 --> 01:45:54.514
DOLLARS YOUR RETURN ON

01:45:54.581 --> 01:45:56.383
INVESTMENT WORKS. OVER A CERTAIN

01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:57.651
AMOUNT OF TIME BUT THE

01:45:57.718 --> 01:45:59.219
MAINTENANCE OF THOSE LINES AND

01:45:59.286 --> 01:46:00.454
YOU KNOW SO WHETHER WE HAVE SEA

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.556
LEVEL RISE AND- AN OCEAN SIDE OF

01:46:02.622 --> 01:46:04.191
MY DISTRICT ARE YOUR FIRES OR

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:05.525
FLOODS YOU HAVE. OTHER THINGS

01:46:05.592 --> 01:46:06.993
THAT WILL REQUIRE MAINTENANCE

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.261
AND THE SMALLER COMPANIES WILL

01:46:08.328 --> 01:46:09.362
JUST NOT HAVE THE ACCESS TO

01:46:09.429 --> 01:46:11.331
CAPITAL TO KEEP THAT OVER TIME

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:12.632
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE SOME

01:46:12.699 --> 01:46:14.234
THOUGHT TO BE GIVEN. ON THE

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:16.503
VIABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND IF

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:17.771
THEY WERE ABLE ARE THE FULL

01:46:17.838 --> 01:46:19.773
VIABILITY OF THE ORGANIZATION

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:20.407
HOWEVER IS PROVIDED. THE

01:46:20.474 --> 01:46:23.210
FUNDING. HOW LIQUID THEY ARE TO

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:25.979
ACCOUNT FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.547
COST OVER TIME. RIGHT MADAM

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:29.116
CHAIR IF I COULD JUST MAKE.

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:30.917
HEALTH POINTS COURTS FIRST IS

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:32.352
THAT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS

01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:34.755
WE'VE SEEN THE COST PER MEGABIT

01:46:34.821 --> 01:46:37.691
DECLINED 90% SO WHEN WE'RE

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:38.492
TALKING ABOUT FIFTY MEGABITS PER

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:40.927
SECOND. THE COST PER MEGABIT

01:46:40.994 --> 01:46:44.264
DECLINING 90% OVER TEN YEARS.

01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:46.199
THIS COULD BE AN ACADEMIC ISSUE

01:46:46.266 --> 01:46:47.734
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S OTHER

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:50.103
FACTORS INVOLVED IN. INFLATION

01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:52.239
YOU HAVE LABOR COSTS CETERA IT

01:46:52.305 --> 01:46:54.374
SECOND POINT IS THAT THERE IS A

THE CHALLENGE PROCESS IN KASA.

02:02:05.951 --> 02:02:07.553

CHANGES RELEASED YESTERDAY- IT

02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:51.897
IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT OUR

LIFE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:31.103
SHOULD BE REPLACED. IT IS AN

02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:32.438

IF HERE'S CONCERN THAT THE

PUBLIC IS NOT BENEFITING ENOUGH

02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:58.430
FROM THE ATP CALIFORNIA HAS THE

HOUSEHOLDS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:19.018
COMES. ON ENTITIES. THE SECOND

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:21.153
THING THE CPUC NEEDS TO ADDRESS

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.988
IS- WE WOULD ARGUE THEY SHOULD

02:04:23.055 --> 02:04:25.791
MAINTAIN THE EXISTING PASSIVE

02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:28.027
TWO YEAR PRICE FREEZE INSTEAD OF

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:30.196
THE PROPOSED TEN YEAR CAP THAT

02:04:30.262 --> 02:04:31.997
WOULD IN FACT LIMIT PARTICIPANTS

02:04:32.064 --> 02:04:33.599
ABILITY TO SUPPORT NETWORK

02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:35.768
MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADES CHARTER

02:04:35.835 --> 02:04:38.237
HAS A NATIONAL PRICING AND

02:04:38.304 --> 02:04:40.706
PACKAGING STRUCTURE CONSUMERS IN

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:43.108
AREAS THAT HAVE LESS COMPETITION

02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:45.010
BENEFIT GREATLY FROM THAT MODEL

02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:47.479
AS IT IS ORIENTED TOWARD

02:04:47.546 --> 02:04:50.082
ENSURING OUR PRICES IN PACKAGING

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:53.419
IT ARE COMPETITIVE IN THE MOST

02:04:53.485 --> 02:04:54.653
WELL SERVED AND COMPETITIVE

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:57.690
MARKETS. AND THIRD WE BELIEVE IN

02:04:57.756 --> 02:04:59.124
CREATING THE STREAMLINED

02:04:59.191 --> 02:05:01.126
CHALLENGE PROCESS THE CPUC

02:05:01.193 --> 02:05:03.395
REALLY NEEDS TO BALANCE SPEED

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:06.165
WITH ACCURACY WHILE ARGUABLY THE

02:05:06.232 --> 02:05:07.833
REDLINE- THAT WAS RELEASED

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:09.668
YESTERDAY IS SOMEWHAT IMPROVED

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:11.670
FROM THE INITIAL DRAFT WE STILL

02:05:11.737 --> 02:05:13.372
BELIEVE THE PROPOSED PROCESS IS

02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:15.140
OVERLY BURDENSOME AND WILL

02:05:15.207 --> 02:05:17.209
ACTUALLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

02:05:17.276 --> 02:05:18.744
TO FOCUS PUBLIC RESOURCES ON

02:05:18.811 --> 02:05:21.513
AREAS THAT LACKS. THIS IN THE

02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:23.349
VOLUME OF DOCUMENTATION THAT

02:05:23.415 --> 02:05:25.384
WILL BE REQUIRED WE THINK WILL

02:05:25.451 --> 02:05:27.686
TAKE LONGER TO REVIEW AND

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:29.655
ANALYZE RATHER THAN ACHIEVING

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:31.824
THE GOAL OF STREAMLINING. OUR

02:05:31.891 --> 02:05:33.392
BUILD OUT EXPERIENCE EXPANDING

02:05:33.459 --> 02:05:35.394
AND UPGRADING OUR SYSTEM HAS

02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:36.929
REVEALED INSIGHTS INTO THE

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:38.597
CHALLENGES THAT CAN EXIST WITH

02:05:38.664 --> 02:05:40.866
LAST MILE CONNECTIVITY. WE OFTEN

02:05:40.933 --> 02:05:43.769
SAY THAT IN EVERY UNSERVED AREA

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:45.838
THERE IS A STORY AND WHETHER

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:47.539
THAT'S AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:49.375
SON SERVED A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S

02:05:49.441 --> 02:05:51.410
UNSERVED OR A DONUT HOLE THAT

02:05:51.477 --> 02:05:53.379
WAS SPOKEN OF BEFORE.

02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:57.082
UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS OFTEN NOT-

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:58.517
ONE A STORY OF THE PROVIDERS

02:05:58.584 --> 02:06:00.753
MAKING. FOR EXAMPLE FOR OVER

02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:02.354
FOUR YEARS CHARTER TRIED TO

02:06:02.421 --> 02:06:04.256
NAVIGATE THE CALTRANS RIGHT OF

02:06:04.323 --> 02:06:06.091
WAY PERMITTING PROCESS TO REACH

02:06:06.158 --> 02:06:07.426
THE COMMUNITY OF ALL TERRORISTS

02:06:07.493 --> 02:06:10.930
IN MODOC COUNTY. RESIDENTS THERE

02:06:10.996 --> 02:06:12.631
COULD HAVE ENJOYED ACCESS TO OUR

02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:14.133
NATIONAL PACKAGING AND YOU THINK

02:06:14.199 --> 02:06:15.668
PUTTING BROADBAND SPEED OF UP TO

02:06:15.734 --> 02:06:17.937
A GAG UNFORTUNATELY AS I SIT

02:06:18.003 --> 02:06:20.072
HERE TODAY WE ARE NO CLOSER TO

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:22.241
CONNECTING ALTURAS. IN OTHER

02:06:22.308 --> 02:06:24.376
INSTANCES WE ROAD WE RUN INTO

02:06:24.443 --> 02:06:26.111
ROAD BLOCKS WITH LOCAL

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:27.046
GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE NUMEROUS

02:06:27.112 --> 02:06:28.614
EXAMPLES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS

02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:30.449
CALIFORNIA WHERE RESIDENTS AND

02:06:30.516 --> 02:06:32.551
BUSINESSES ASK US TO BRING THEM

02:06:32.618 --> 02:06:35.020
SERVICE. AND YET WE ARE NOT ABLE

02:06:35.087 --> 02:06:37.923
TO MEET THAT DEMAND DUE TO

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.158
LENGTHY PERMITTING PROCESSES AND

02:06:39.224 --> 02:06:41.660
THE THESE. INSTANCES THOSE BUT

02:06:41.727 --> 02:06:43.963
IT'S FAR OVERSTEPPED THE IMPACTS

02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:47.199
ON ACCOUNT ACCESSING THE PUBLIC

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:48.434
RIGHT OF WAY. IN ADDITION ARE

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:49.835
FACING AN EVER CHANGING IT

02:06:49.902 --> 02:06:51.670
LITORIA ENVIRONMENT WITH EVER

02:06:51.737 --> 02:06:53.372
INCREASING REQUIREMENTS DOES

02:06:53.439 --> 02:06:56.008
CREATE BUSINESS UNCERTAINTY AND

02:06:56.075 --> 02:06:58.510
ACCIDENTS A DISINCENTIVE FOR

02:06:58.577 --> 02:07:00.379
GREATER INVESTMENT. IT'S

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:02.147
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:03.949
WHEN CHARTER BUILDS TO OR

02:07:04.016 --> 02:07:06.952
UPGRADES AN AREA WE DO SO TO THE

02:07:07.019 --> 02:07:09.755
WHOLE AREA DECISIONS ARE BASED

02:07:09.822 --> 02:07:11.890
ON THE COST TO BUILD AND THE

02:07:11.957 --> 02:07:14.360
DENSITY OF THE AREA NOT INCOME

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:16.628
LEVELS WELL URBAN AND RURAL

02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:18.630
PROJECTS FACE THEIR OWN UNIQUE

02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:20.632
CHALLENGES I WILL HIGHLIGHT AND

02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:22.167
NOTE THAT RURAL AREAS

02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:24.236
UNFORTUNATELY ARE OFTENTIMES

02:07:24.303 --> 02:07:25.304
SIMPLY MORE DIFFICULT AND

02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:27.873
EXPENSIVE TO REACH- THEY AND

02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:29.708
BARBARA INVOLVED VAST. LARGER

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:31.777
PROJECTS THEY HAVE MUCH LOWER

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:34.413
POPULATION DENSITIES AND THEY DO

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.048
REQUIRE GREATER OPERATIONAL

02:07:36.115 --> 02:07:38.550
SUPPORT FROM TECHNICIANS GIVEN

02:07:38.617 --> 02:07:39.952
THE LARGE GEOGRAPHIES THAT WE'RE

02:07:40.019 --> 02:07:42.187
TALKING ABOUT- ALSO MEANT REALLY

02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:43.956
MENTION REALLY QUICKLY THE NEED

02:07:44.023 --> 02:07:45.824
TO ATTACHED TO UTILITY POLES.

02:07:45.891 --> 02:07:47.526
MAYBE THE BEST OPTION BUT IT'S

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:49.361
OFTEN A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF

02:07:49.428 --> 02:07:51.697
DELAY AND ADDITIONAL COST FOR

02:07:51.764 --> 02:07:53.999
EXAMPLE IN OUR URBAN AREA YOU

02:07:54.066 --> 02:07:55.634
MAY BE ABLE TO REACH TEN HOMES

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:57.236
BY ATTACHING TO IT THANGAL ALL.

02:07:57.302 --> 02:07:59.405
IN OUR AREA THAT CAN BE FLIPPED

02:07:59.471 --> 02:08:01.073
LET'S HEAD AND IT COULD TAKE

02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:03.675
ATTACHING TO TENTPOLES TO REACH

02:08:03.742 --> 02:08:05.778
ONE HOME AND NOT PULL IT UP TO

02:08:05.844 --> 02:08:07.379
MY PROCESS CAN BE LENGTHY. I

02:08:07.446 --> 02:08:09.381
THANK YOU FOR BEING US DEPART.

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:11.250
DAY AND I WILL BEG YOUR

02:08:11.316 --> 02:08:13.752
INDULGENCE I DO HAVE ONE OF OUR

02:08:13.819 --> 02:08:15.287
REGULAR- EXPERT TOWARD FIRST

02:08:15.354 --> 02:08:16.989
HERE WITH IF WE- VERY TO AREAS

02:08:17.056 --> 02:08:19.458
MORE HIS EXPERTISE AND QUESTIONS

02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:23.295
I'LL ASK THAT HE- JOIN US. THANK

02:08:23.362 --> 02:08:25.464
YOU THAT WAS VERY OFFENSIVE AND

02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:27.399
I THINK WE ALL CONTINUE TO LEARN

02:08:27.466 --> 02:08:30.469
ON THIS COMMITTEE- ALL OF THE

02:08:30.536 --> 02:08:32.938
EXTENSIVE PROCESSES AND SCOPE

02:08:33.005 --> 02:08:36.909
YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH- I WILL

02:08:36.975 --> 02:08:38.577
OPEN IT UPTO QUESTIONS I HAVE A

02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:41.146
FEW QUESTIONS BUT- ALLOW THE

02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:47.419
MEMBERS. SO RELATED TO CHARTER

02:08:47.486 --> 02:08:51.290
THAN- I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:08:51.356 --> 02:08:53.725
USE THESE GRANTS AND ONE OF THE

02:08:53.792 --> 02:08:55.360
THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO KNOW

02:08:55.427 --> 02:08:58.564
IS- THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW

02:08:58.630 --> 02:08:59.898
THAT HAVE APPLIED FOR THE GRANTS

02:08:59.965 --> 02:09:02.501
IN URBAN AREAS YOU DID HAVE A

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:04.837
PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES TO

02:09:04.903 --> 02:09:05.871
CONNECT TO A TRAILER PARK

02:09:05.938 --> 02:09:07.940
SERVICE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW

02:09:08.006 --> 02:09:11.743
IT WOULD IDENTIFIED THAT AREA AS

02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:14.480
A PROJECT AND HOW WAS THAT THE

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:16.281
NATION WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER

02:09:16.348 --> 02:09:18.250
AS WE KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN SOME

02:09:18.317 --> 02:09:21.620
OF THE- SENATE SOMETIMES- IF YOU

02:09:21.687 --> 02:09:23.255
WANT THE SAME UP HOMES THE

02:09:23.322 --> 02:09:25.624
CHOSEN NOT TO MOVE FORWARD YEAH

02:09:25.691 --> 02:09:26.592
SO WE YOU WILL. WE WILL NOTICE I

02:09:26.658 --> 02:09:29.361
MEAN ALL OF IT IS PUBLIC RIGHT-

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:31.463
OUR FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF

02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:32.397
PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM

02:09:32.464 --> 02:09:34.266
WERE SOMEWHAT HEAVILY WEIGHTED

02:09:34.333 --> 02:09:35.567
TOWARD MOBILE HOME PARKS

02:09:35.634 --> 02:09:37.870
OBVIOUSLY WE THOSE THAT THOSE

02:09:37.936 --> 02:09:38.937
COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE CONNECTED

02:09:39.004 --> 02:09:41.540
JUST LIKE ALL OF. BUT OF THAT

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:42.508
WAS DUE TO CHALLENGES

02:09:42.574 --> 02:09:44.643
IDENTIFYING ELIGIBLE AREAS SO

02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:46.845
THE PRIOR ELIGIBILITY WAS SIX

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:49.515
HAVE BUY ONE. SERVICE AND THE

02:09:49.581 --> 02:09:50.849
NEW ELIGIBILITY IS TWENTY FIVE

02:09:50.916 --> 02:09:52.951
BY THREE SO IT IT WE BELIEVE

02:09:53.018 --> 02:09:55.220
GOING FORWARD THERE WILL BE MORE

02:09:55.287 --> 02:09:56.955
AREAS THAT THAT WILL BE

02:09:57.022 --> 02:09:59.691
IDENTIFIED- WE DID HAVE TO

02:09:59.758 --> 02:10:01.660
RETURN SOME OF OUR GRANT OF

02:10:01.727 --> 02:10:05.164
FUNDS. BECAUSE WE WERE NOT ABLE

02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:06.999
TO ACCESS PROPERTY BASED ON

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:08.734
RIGHT OF ENTRY WE CAN'T ACCESS

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.402
PROPERTY UNLESS WE HAVE

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:12.938
PERMISSION- AND IN A FEW

02:10:13.005 --> 02:10:13.839
INSTANCES IN THOSE MOBILE HOME

02:10:13.906 --> 02:10:15.440
PARKS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO

02:10:15.507 --> 02:10:16.441
NEGOTIATE THAT WITH. THE PARK

02:10:16.508 --> 02:10:19.344
OWNERS SO IT IT CAN CREATE A

02:10:19.411 --> 02:10:20.612
BARRIER WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC

02:10:20.679 --> 02:10:21.480
PROPERTY WE HAVE OTHER ISSUES

02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:23.182
GOING ON AND- IN SOME AREAS

02:10:23.248 --> 02:10:24.383
AROUND PUBLIC PROPERTY AND

02:10:24.449 --> 02:10:26.151
CHALLENGES TRYING TO GET

02:10:26.218 --> 02:10:27.986
PERMISSION BUT BUT RIGHT OF

02:10:28.053 --> 02:10:29.821
ENTRY CAN BE AN ISSUE. AND DO

02:10:29.888 --> 02:10:31.456
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA JUST ACROSS

02:10:31.523 --> 02:10:33.325
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST

02:10:33.392 --> 02:10:36.028
LOOKING OUT MOBILE HOMES- ANY

02:10:36.094 --> 02:10:37.629
TYPE OF PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WHO

02:10:37.696 --> 02:10:39.231
ARE CONNECTED VERSUS THOSE WHO

02:10:39.298 --> 02:10:42.668
ARE NOT CONNECTED. I DO NOT.

02:10:42.734 --> 02:10:43.902
THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING

02:10:43.969 --> 02:10:46.071
INFORMATION BECAUSE WHEN WE KNOW

02:10:46.138 --> 02:10:48.307
THERE ARE MORE IF YOU WANT TO

02:10:48.373 --> 02:10:50.509
SAY SENIORS BUT WE ALSO KNOW

02:10:50.576 --> 02:10:52.110
THEIR YOUNG FAMILIES THAT ARE

02:10:52.177 --> 02:10:53.478
LIVING AND SOME OF THESE BUT

02:10:53.545 --> 02:10:54.813
THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING FOR US

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.615
TO RESEARCH. AND THEN ONE A

02:10:56.682 --> 02:11:00.052
QUESTION ABOUT CALAVERAS- WHAT

02:11:00.118 --> 02:11:03.322
IS YOUR RESPONSE TO CRITICS WHO

02:11:03.388 --> 02:11:05.591
WOULD SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT

02:11:05.657 --> 02:11:06.592
SHOULDN'T BE INVOLVED IN

02:11:06.658 --> 02:11:09.595
BROADBAND- I WOULD SAY THAT. I

02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:11.463
WOULD I THINK WE WOULD ALL BE

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:13.632
HAPPIER IF WE KNEW THAT THE

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:14.399
PRIVATE SECTOR CONSERVE ALL THE

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:16.602
PARTS CALIFORNIA BUT AS AS MISS

02:11:16.668 --> 02:11:18.237
BAILEY POINTED OUT. IT'S NOT

02:11:18.303 --> 02:11:19.671
LIKELY FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:11:19.738 --> 02:11:21.473
REASONS SO WE COULD ASK THE SAME

02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:23.875
QUESTION WHY WOULD. NONPROFIT

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:24.743
CLUBS BE PART OF

02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:27.179
ELECTRIFICATION. THE JOBS NEEDED

02:11:27.246 --> 02:11:28.513
TO HAPPEN WE NEED TO PROVIDE

02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:30.449
SERVICE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS

02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:33.919
RURAL AND URBAN. AND SELL-

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:35.053
UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNMENT'S

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:36.722
GOING TO HAVE TO STEP INTO THIS

02:11:36.788 --> 02:11:38.390
HOWEVER WE DO HAVE GOOD PRACTICE

02:11:38.457 --> 02:11:40.359
AT PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:11:40.425 --> 02:11:43.362
ROADS PLAN MONEY FEDERAL STATE

02:11:43.428 --> 02:11:45.764
LOCAL MINING. WE BUILD FEDERAL

02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:47.733

BUILD THE LOCAL ROADS AND WE

02:11:50.736 --> 02:11:52.437
LET. INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES

02:11:52.504 --> 02:11:54.539
RUN STOREFRONTS. SO THAT'S WHY

02:11:54.606 --> 02:11:56.441
WE HAVE TO BE THERE BECAUSE WE

02:11:56.508 --> 02:11:58.243
HAVE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO OUR

02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:59.911

. YES ANY EXPANSION ON THAT OR

02:12:17.095 --> 02:12:21.033
OF I MEAN I THINK WHAT WE ARE

02:12:21.099 --> 02:12:22.701
CONCERNED FOR A LOT OF THE

02:12:22.768 --> 02:12:23.702
REASONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

02:12:23.769 --> 02:12:28.106
MENTIONED- IN TERMS OF NOT ONLY

02:12:28.173 --> 02:12:31.143
ARBITRARY. PRICE CAPS THAT BEN

02:12:31.209 --> 02:12:32.744
ARE FIXED IN TIME AND WE

02:12:32.811 --> 02:12:34.546
APPRECIATE THAT THERE MAY BE A

02:12:34.613 --> 02:12:37.115
WAIVER PROCESS I THINK YOU KNOW

02:12:37.182 --> 02:12:39.251
WE JUST GOT A LOOK AT THAT

02:12:39.318 --> 02:12:40.585
YESTERDAY- I THINK WE STILL.

02:12:40.652 --> 02:12:43.855
OBVIOUSLY IT IS A DISCRETIONARY

02:12:43.922 --> 02:12:44.890
IF YOU WILL SO THERE'S NO

02:12:44.956 --> 02:12:46.291
GUARANTEE THAT APPLYING FOR A

02:12:46.358 --> 02:12:48.126
WAIVER YOU'RE GOING TO GET ONE-

02:12:48.193 --> 02:12:49.494
WE ALSO THINK IN SOME WAYS IT'S

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:51.363
A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFUSING

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.197
PROCESS AND TORY COULD DRILL

02:12:52.264 --> 02:12:54.666
DOWN. ON DETAILS MORE IF YOU

02:12:54.733 --> 02:12:58.537
WOULD LIKE- BUT ALSO- I THINK WE

02:12:58.603 --> 02:13:00.505
HAVE CONCERNS THAT GOING FORWARD

02:13:00.572 --> 02:13:01.973
YOU KNOW WITH THE BEAT PROGRAM

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:03.108
ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT'S

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:04.710
COMING DOWN YOU'RE SETTING THAT

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:06.478
YOU KNOW THAT THAT PC IS

02:13:06.545 --> 02:13:09.114
ATTEMPTING TO SET. ONE PARAMETER

02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:10.849
WITH THIS BUCKET OF MONEY CAST

02:13:10.916 --> 02:13:13.118
IF ALREADY HAS AN EXISTING TWO

02:13:13.185 --> 02:13:14.886
YEAR PRICE FREEZE THAT WE THINK

02:13:14.953 --> 02:13:16.922
IS WORKING WELL THERE MAY BE

02:13:16.988 --> 02:13:18.857
SOME ROOM TO GO BETWEEN TWO YEAR

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:20.392
AND TEN BUT NOW YOU'RE GONNA

02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:22.127
HAVE A TWO YEAR AND THEN THIS

02:13:22.194 --> 02:13:24.029
BUCKET OF MONEY. IS GOING TO BE

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:25.330
A TEN YEAR AND THEN. MAYBE THE

02:13:25.397 --> 02:13:26.665
STATE PLAN THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:13:26.732 --> 02:13:28.066
PUTS TOGETHER THREE LEGISLATION

02:13:28.133 --> 02:13:29.568
HAS A DIFFERENT VISION AND ALL

02:13:29.634 --> 02:13:31.536
OF A SUDDEN YOU GO BACK TO THE

02:13:31.603 --> 02:13:33.305
REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY ISSUE

02:13:33.372 --> 02:13:34.740
AND- WHICH BUCKET ARE WE

02:13:34.806 --> 02:13:36.408
APPLYING FOR AND HOW AND HOW DO

02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:38.210
YOU. REGIONAL LIES THAT- AS A

02:13:38.276 --> 02:13:40.112
COMPANY- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

02:13:40.178 --> 02:13:41.580
IT'S A CHALLENGE AND IT'S

02:13:41.646 --> 02:13:44.182
UNNECESSARY. BECAUSE COMPANIES

02:13:44.249 --> 02:13:47.719
ALREADY HAVE. LOW COST PROGRAMS

02:13:47.786 --> 02:13:49.221
IN THE MARKET PLACE AS I

02:13:49.287 --> 02:13:50.555
MENTIONED COMPANIES HAVE

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:53.825
COMMITTED. TO ADDITIONAL STEPS

02:13:53.892 --> 02:13:55.560
WITH HIGHER SPEEDS FOR ACP

02:13:55.627 --> 02:13:57.496
QUALIFIED HOMES AND THE STATE

02:13:57.562 --> 02:13:58.730
ABSOLUTELY HAS THE WHERE WITH

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:01.233
ALL. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE

02:14:01.299 --> 02:14:03.402
THROUGH ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES IF.

02:14:03.468 --> 02:14:04.669
THE CONCERN IS THERE ARE SOME

02:14:04.736 --> 02:14:06.938
PEOPLE WHO ARE ON ON THE CUSP

02:14:07.005 --> 02:14:08.673
AND MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR SOME OF

02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:10.642
THE EXISTING PROGRAMS. MAY NEED

02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:12.511
A LITTLE HELP IT'S BETTER TO

02:14:12.577 --> 02:14:13.779
REALLY GO IN AND SURGICALLY

02:14:13.845 --> 02:14:15.914
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THEN JUST

02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:20.018
CREATE THIS SWEEPING- MANDATE

02:14:20.085 --> 02:14:23.188
THAT THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT-

02:14:23.255 --> 02:14:25.323
HIGHLY UNLIKELY I WILL SAY THAT

02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:26.725
COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO

02:14:26.792 --> 02:14:28.360
PARTICIPATE. YEAH I WOULD JUST

02:14:28.427 --> 02:14:29.694
ADD THAT YOU KNOW MY

02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:31.029
UNDERSTANDING OF OUR

02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:33.698
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW- BALA TILE

02:14:33.765 --> 02:14:34.733
THE ECONOMY IS RIGHT NOW WITH

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:36.601
INFLATION THAT IT WOULD BE SCARY

02:14:36.668 --> 02:14:38.370
FOR ANY BUSINESS TO. BE ABLE TO

02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:40.839
COMMIT TO A TENURE- PRICE FREEZE

02:14:40.906 --> 02:14:43.942
SO USING. DATA AND INFORMATION

02:14:44.009 --> 02:14:45.143
AND PROGRAMS ALREADY EXIST THAT

02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:47.045
WE KNOW SUCH AS MAYBE TO YOUR

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:49.448
FEES WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING

02:14:49.514 --> 02:14:50.449
THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY LOOK

02:14:50.515 --> 02:14:51.583
INTO DID YOU WANT TO ADD

02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:53.518
ANYTHING TO. FOR MONEY FROM-

02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:54.286
GONE SICKENING THREAT I WE HAVE

02:14:54.352 --> 02:14:56.321
LOOKED AT THIS AS WELL WE DON'T

02:14:56.388 --> 02:14:57.556
HAVE THE SAME CONSTRAINTS IS A

02:14:57.622 --> 02:14:59.291
PRIVATE COMPANY DOES. WE DON'T

02:14:59.357 --> 02:15:01.626
HAVE TO RETURN HAVE A RETURN ON

02:15:01.693 --> 02:15:02.761
INVESTMENT FOR INVESTORS. WE

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:04.996
REPRESENT THE PUBLIC SO WE WILL

02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:07.599
RECEIVE THIS THIS BOND. ISSUE

02:15:07.666 --> 02:15:11.002
AND THAT IS FIXED PRICE SO WE

02:15:11.069 --> 02:15:11.837
ARE IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS.

02:15:11.903 --> 02:15:16.374
