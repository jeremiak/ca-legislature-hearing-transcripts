CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATORS CAPITO HERE CABALLERO PRESENT NIELSEN DOESN'T. NIELSEN PRESIDENT DORADO. HERTZBERG PRESIDENT WIENER. YOU HAVE A QUORUM AKORN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED NOW WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR AUTHOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE WELCOME SENATOR DODD YOU MAY PRESENT ON YOUR BILL SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEDICARE. GET MEMBERS SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO WOULD AUTHORIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO FORM COMMUNITY RESILIENCE FINANCING DISTRICTS. TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL. LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT TO SHOWN IN THE S. B. EIGHT FIFTY TO MOCK UP DISTRIBUTED COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I ALSO WANTED TO THANK THE CONSULTANT FOR HIS EFFORTS ON THIS BILL. WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE EXISTENTIAL THREATS POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND I NEED NOT DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM YET AGAIN. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE STATE HAS RESPONDED TO CLIMATE CHANGE BY APPROPRIATING BILLIONS. TO FIND A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THAT SEEK TO PREVENT AND PROTECT OUR STATE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE DISASTER. STATE PROGRAMS ADDRESS A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES ACROSS THE OLD STATE LANDSCAPE HOWEVER THERE ARE DIFFERENT RISKS POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE THAT AFFECTS A DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS. IN SOME COMMUNITIES SUCH AS WHAT I REPRESENT THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN SOME COMMUNITIES THE MOST SERIOUS THREAT FROM. RESULTS FROM SEA LEVEL RISE IN YET ANOTHER COMMUNITIES EXTREME HEAT EVENTS POSE THE GREATEST DANGER PROVIDE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH ANOTHER TOOL TO PUT THEIR TOOL KITS TO HELP COPE WITH AND PREVENT CLIMATE RELATED DISASTERS THAT ARE MOST CRITICAL TO THEM. ASSEMBLY EIGHT FIFTY TWO PERMITS CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO WORK AS A JOINT ENDEAVOR TO DEVELOP PLANS TO ADDRESS THE HIGHEST LOCAL CLIMATE CHANGE PRIORITIES AND GENERATE REVENUE TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PLANS. THE FINANCING MECHANISMS EMBODIED IN THE BILL ALREADY EXISTED LAW SUCH AS TAX INCREMENT FINANCING AND VOTER APPROVED PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE EACH ONE OF THE REVENUE RAISING MECHANISMS IN SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO ARE AVAILABLE TO CITIES AND COUNTIES ACTING INDIVIDUALLY NOW. UNDER SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO THOSE SAME MECHANISMS WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO LOCAL ENTITIES WORKING TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY RESILIENCE FINANCING DISTRICTS. BECAUSE SOME CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEMS ARE BETTER ADDRESSED WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES WORK COLLABORATIVELY. NOTHING IN THIS BILL MANDATES FORMATION OF A DISTRICT AND NOTHING THIS BILL CHANGES THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VOTER APPROVAL AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WERE VOTER APPROVAL AND PARTICIPATION ARE NOW REQUIRED. WITH ME TODAY ARE FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROGER DICKINSON WHO NOW SERVES AS THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF CIVIC WELL ADD MIKE PETERSON DEPUTY INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK. AND AT THE FLOOR IS YOURS.

THIRD PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPTIMIZE LOCAL STATE FEDERAL AND PRIVATE RESOURCES TO MEET CLIMATE CHALLENGES MOST IMPORTANT TO THEIR COMMUNITY FOURTH GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FLEXIBILITY IN ADOPTING THE RIGHT FINANCING APPROACH FOR THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR COMMUNITY AND FIFTH GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND REGIONS THE FLEXIBILITY TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS IN THEIR LOCALITY. WHILE THE STATE HAS ENACTED PROGRAMS AND MADE INVESTMENTS TO MEET THE INCREASING URGENCY OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN RECENT STEPS TO ALSO DO SO FAR LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO DEVELOPING A COHESIVE AND COORDINATED APPROACH AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL. AS THE GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY RELEASED EARLIER THIS WEEK NOTED PARTNERSHIPS COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION IN OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD CLIMATE RESILIENCE ARE ESSENTIAL GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF THREATS CALIFORNIA FACES IN THE VAST ARRAY OF ENTITIES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON BUILDING OUR RESILIENCE TO THESE THREATS. ALL ENTITIES FROM INDIVIDUALS TO TRIBAL LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR HOLD A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AND MUST WORK TOGETHER TO LEVERAGE EACH OTHER'S STRENGTHS AND ACTIONS IN RESPONSE. TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO THANK YOU.

EIGHT NINE SEVEN WELCOME GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I'M PRESENTING SP EIGHT NINE SEVEN I WANT TO START WITH EXPLAINED THE TECHS OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH I AM ACCEPTING TODAY THE TO CHEER IN THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THE WORK THAT DAY- HAVE DONE WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL- WE HEARD FROM OTHERS IN OPPOSITION FROM THE FROM THE BUILDING OFFICIALS IN WHICH ALL SECTION ONE WE'RE WHEN IT COMES TO THE LOCAL BUILDING CODES WE'RE GONNA PUT IN LANGUAGE THAT WILL SAY THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ACCESSORY UNIT DWELLING SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A GROUP OUR OCCUPANCY CHANGE. ON THE LOCAL BUILDING CODES THAT WILL CLARIFY FOR THE BUILDING OFFICIALS WHETHER THAT WILL TAKE THEM OFF THE OPPOSITION WILL FIND OUT THAT PRETTY SOON BUT AT LEAST IT'S CLEAR FINE WITH REGARD TO THE HEIGHTS THAT MEANT  LOT OF THE ATTENTION HAS BEEN ON THE HEIGHT LIMIT APPRECIATED CHEERS- INPUT HERE SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'LL GET ALLOW WE'RE GOOD THE TEXAS COULD GO BACK TO SIXTEEN FEET WHICH IS WITH WHICH IT IS RIGHT NOW BUT WE'LL GET ALLOW IF YOU WITHIN A HALF MILE OF WALKING DISTANCE FROM MAJOR A TRANSIT STOP YOU GET THE TWENTY FIVE FOOT- LIMIT AND IF YOU HAVE AN ATTACHED EIGHTY YOU TO YOUR PRIMARY. RESIDENCE YOU GET THE ATTACHED A TWENTY FIVE FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT SO THAT WILL NARROW THE BILL ALLOWS SOME OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY ELSE WILL COME IN AND FINALLY ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE WE PUT THAT IN THE FIRST EIGHTY YOU BILL THAT I DID- THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO BUILDING THAT'S BEEN DEEMED SUBSTANDARD TO ARE PUTTING THE SUB STANDARD LANGUAGE IN THERE WHICH AGAIN NARROWS THE BILL BUT ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW HELPS FOR MORE OF THESE EXISTING EIGHTY USED TO GET LEGALIZED SO THAT THAT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE FEEL THE COMFORT I MEAN AS A STAFF REPORT POINTS. OUT AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET SECOND YOU IT'S A RIGHT WE HAD A BILL AND THOUSAND TWO AND WHAT WE FOUND OUT IS THAT ALL THE CITIES HAVE MADE ORDINANCES THAT MADE. POSSIBLE OR ECONOMICALLY. IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BUILD AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAD FORTY YEARS OF BASICALLY UNPERMITTED UNITS TO COMMAND SO THIS BILL. BUILDS ON THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE NEXT SIX. LAST SIX YEARS AND REALLY REMOVES BARRIERS AND IN MY OPINION UNNECESSARY BARRIERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR. FOR EIGHTY YOU CONSTRUCTION MUCH OF THE BILL. MOST OF IT IS FEEDBACK THAT I'VE GOTTEN FOR THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HAVE GOTTEN FROM INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITIES OR OTHER CITIES THAT ARE STILL FACING SOME BARRIERS THAT SUPPRESS EIGHTY YOU. CONSTRUCTION SO THIS IS GOOD ALLOW HOMEOWNERS TO MAKE BETTER USE OF THEIR PROPERTY PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL AND GENERALLY. MORE AFFORDABLE RENTAL AVAILABILITY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE FOR WEALTH BUILDING AND WE TALK ABOUT WEALTH BUILDING BUT REALLY SOME OF THE- PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO DO IT OR THEY JUST DON'T EXIST AND THERE'S A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS FOR THE STATE TO GET INTO THE- BUSINESS OF GIVING PEOPLE SOME GRANTS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE. YOU KNOW A THIRD OF OUR EXTREMELY LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE HOMEOWNERS WE FORGET ABOUT THAT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT RENTER'S BUT WE FORGET THAT THERE ARE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME. THAT HAVE EXTENDED FAMILIES WERE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD WEALTH- IN ADDITION- TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF AN UNPERMITTED EIGHTY USED AS AMENDED THE BILL WILL PROVIDE THE LOCAL WILL PROHIBIT A LOCAL AGENCY FROM DENYING A PERMIT- FROM THESE UNPERMITTED EIGHTY USE THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT'S ANOTHER AMENDMENT TO SAID I REALIZE IT IS WE PASS THESE BILLS EIGHT PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY GO IN AND BUILD A NON PERMIT UNIT AND COME BACK AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS WE'RE GOING TO PUT A STOP IN A WHICH IS SORT OF WHAT. ALL THE LEGACY AND PERMITTED UNITS FOR THEIR END BY DRESSING THESE BARRIERS OUR HOPE IS THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY GETTING COURAGE HOMEOWNERS TO ASSIST US IN DEALING WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT WE'RE GOOD ALLOW HOMEOWNERS TO CREATE MORE FINANCIALLY STATE MORE FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR THEMSELVES IN WITH ME I HAVE KELLY FALLON WHICH IS WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL.

WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND RESPECT THE CENTERS-YOU KNOW TENACITY AROUND EIGHTY USE AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT CHANGE EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS- THERE'S NO DENYING THAT THROUGH HIS EFFORTS WE'VE SEEN A PROLIFERATION OF EDUS. AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES I'M EMBRACE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND BECAUSE IT IS A WAY TO YOU KNOW GET GREATER DENSITY IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT THAT IS. LESS INTRUSIVE THAN WHAT OTHERWISE MIGHT BE- APPRECIATE THE AMENDED ON REDUCING THE HEIGHT YOU KNOW WITH AND MOST OF THE NEIGHBORS BUT A TWENTY FIVE FOOT HEIGHT IS STILL A REALLY LARGE HEIGHT PARTICULAR AREAS THAT HAVE. YOU KNOW A HEIGHT LIMITATION OF A SINGLE STORY HOME- IT MAKES YOU REALLY WONDER WHAT. ARE THESE AN ACCESSORY TO RATE I THINK WE'RE GETTING AWAY FROM THE NOTION OF THESE ARE SMALLER GRANNY FLATS YOU ACCESSORY IN ITS AND THAT IN FACT THESE ARE REALLY TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT TWO STORY HOMES. THAT ARE NOW GOING TO POP UP IN SOMEBODY'S BACKYARD AND WHILE THAT MIGHT BE OKAY I WAS SOON SOME NEIGHBORS MIGHT YOU KNOW- NOT LIKE IT SO MUCH IF THEY BOUGHT A HOME THAT'S YOU KNOW IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS A LOWER YOU KNOW HEIGHTS. AND NOW WITH YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THESE TWO STORIES UP STRUCTURES POP UP SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW TO CONSIDER BUILDING CODES- YOU KNOW SCALING THAT BACK TO WHAT YOU MENTION I THINK IS IMPORTANT WILL CERTAINLY WORK WITH OUR FRIENDS OVER THE BUILDING CODE OFFICIALS TO SEE. IF THAT MEANS THEY'RE THEY'RE THE REQUIREMENTS AND FINALLY THE LAST CONCERN THAT REALLY REMAINS- IS ALLOWING A TWO EIGHTY USED TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON A PARCEL FREE PROPOSED MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THAT MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT EVER BE DEVELOPED SO YOU GET TO EXCESS THREE DEAL DWELLING UNITS ACCESSORY TO NOTHING BECAUSE THE PRIMARY UNIT MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN CONSTRUCTED.

AND A HOUSING COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR HIS LONGSTANDING LEADERSHIP AROUND EIGHTY USE- GOING BACK BEFORE I WAS IN THE SENATE WELL I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS. ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND ON THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WE WERE CONSIDERING EARLY- LEGISLATION TWENTY FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN OF THE BY CENTER BY CAL SKI- TO MAKE CALIFORNIA'S EIGHTY YOU LAWS MEANINGFUL- AND THERE WAS A COMPLETE AND UTTER MELTDOWN BY LITTLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE CENTER BY CAL SKI WAS- CLOSING LOOPHOLES THAT CITIES. LIKE MY OWN HAD EXPLOITED FOR DECADES TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BUILDING A TO USE COMPLETE MELTDOWN- AND THAT LAW THAT BILL PASSED. ON SKY DID NOT FALL- AND THEN- OVER TIME WE'VE HAD DO MORE MORE LEGISLATION. TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES THAT SOME CITIES NOT ALL BUT SOME HAVE BEEN EXPLOITING TO MAKE IT HARDER IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO PUT EIGHTY USE- IN THEIR IN THEIR HOMES AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR- WHO IS. SADLY TERMING OUT THE END OF THIS YEAR AND WE'RE GOING TO MISS HIM DEARLY FOR MANY REASONS- BUT IS YOU KNOW- TRYING TO- TAKE SOME OF THE REMAINING ISSUES AND ADDRESS THEM- SO THAT WE'RE NOT. PUTTING CONDITIONS AND LIMITS ON EIGHTY USE THAT MAKE IT HARD OR IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD THEM- YOU KNOW. IT'S DISAPPOINTING TO ME THAT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS- JUST UP IS JUST. OPPOSITION IT CLAIMING WE LOVE A TO USE WE LOVE EIGHTY YEARS DON'T MAKE US BUILD. YOU KNOW TALLER APARTMENT BUILDINGS WE CAN TEST TO WITH THE TO USE TRYING TO RELY ON YOU TO USE EVEN IN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT SOMETIMES IN INAPPROPRIATE WAYS. BUT THEN CONTINUING TO COME FORWARD AND OF AN OPPOSING EFFORTS. TO TRY TO MAKE THE EDU PROGRAM- AS ROBUST AS POSSIBLE- AND THE IDEA THAT THERE WOULD BE A CONCERN THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE AN EIGHTY YOU WITHOUT A PRIMARY HOME I DON'T. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT IF IT DOES WHO CARES. IT'S STILL A HOUSING. UNIT THAT SOMEONE CAN LIVE IN- AND TO COMPARE THIS TO THE- TO THE- THE WAREHOUSE FIRE TO GO TO THE GROCERY BUYER IN OAKLAND. I'M SORRY BUT THAT IS MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT DRAMATIC. TALK ABOUT EDIE YOU HEAR ABOUT ABOUT A MASSIVE. DANGEROUS WAREHOUSE- THAT WAS BUILT MANY MANY MANY YEARS AGO. SO I YOU KNOW I THINK IN THE END WE HEAR A LOT OF THIS CONSTANT LIKE NIT PICKING EXCUSES FOR WHY WE CAN'T DO THIS- AND GOD FORBID YOU HAVE A TWO STORY EIGHTY YOU. GOT FOR BEDS AND I THANK THE CHAIR THE CHAIR FOR HAVING HAD SOME CONCERN BUT WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO COME TO A GOOD COMPROMISE ON THIS BILL AROUND. THE HEIGHT ISSUE- AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD COMBINATION YOU KNOW IN THE END I WISH SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS WOULD BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR CARS THAT WE HAVE TEN PEOPLE FIFTEEN PEOPLE LIVING IN ONE APARTMENT. TOGETHER IN MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA OVERCROWDING BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD. TO HAVE TO HOUSING FOR. YOU KNOW FOR TWO OR THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE. I WHICH WOULD FOCUS ON THAT. BUT THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE. AS OPPOSED TO. WE DON'T WANT A FEW EXTRA FEET OF HIGH WE DON'T WANT TO STORY EIGHTY USE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TO YOU WITHOUT A- SINGLE FAMILY HOME- YOU KNOW- IT'S JUST VERY VERY FRUSTRATING TO ME- I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD BILL AND HAPPY TO MOVE A- MANAGER THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU MAY WANT TO ADOPT THAT IS YOUR CLOSING SENATOR. HERTZBERG ON A MAKE MINE SHORT. TWO THINGS I JUST WANTED FOR THE RECORD TO SAY THAT IN THE LOS ANGELES. YEP OF FIRST THING I WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO DENNIS CARDOZA WHO IT IS THESE WERE CALLED GRANNY FLATS WHEN HE DID IT BACK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY NEVER PASSED THOSE YOU NEVER FORGET THE PEOPLE THAT CAME BEFORE TO- THE SEVERAL VALLEYS AND WILDLY SUCCESSFUL. IN TERMS OF PROVIDING HOUSING MORE THAN SIXTY OR 70% OF ALL THE EIGHTY USED IN THE LA THAT EVENTUALLY BEEN APPROVED AND BUILT OUR FROM THE SERVER NO VALLEY AND THREE CAN YOU ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE HEIGHT RESTRICTION THE MEMBERS THAT YOU TOOK. WITH THE YEARS WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. YEAH SO WELL I'M I'M SURE IT'S. SO WE'RE GOING TO. STRIKE THE TWENTY FIVE FEET THAT'S IN THERE. AND GO BACK TO SIXTEEN STATEWIDE EXCEPT IF YOU'RE- IT WITHIN HALF MILE OF A MAJOR TRANSIT STOPS IF YOU GOT FIXED RAIL. IF YOU'VE GOT MAJOR BUS STOPS THEN YOU GET STE WE ARE IN A HALF MILE YOU GET TO GO UP TO TWENTY FIVE FEET. THE SECOND IS THAT IF YOU HAVE AN EIGHTY YOU THAT'S ATTACHED TO YOUR HOUSE SO. YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE HAVE SECOND STORIES ON THEIR ON THEIR HOUSE IF IT'S ATTACHED. THEN YOU GET TO YOU GET TO GO TO A- TWENTY FIVE FEET OR WHATEVER LOCAL ORDINANCES WE'RE NOT TRYING TO. THE LOCAL ORDINANCES TWENTY THREE TEN WHEN I. GOING OVER BUT MOST OF THESE ORDINANCE FOR THEIR- AND THAT'S END SO EVERYTHING ELSE WILL. THE EXISTING WILL REMAIN THE SAME. ANY MORE COMMENTS SENATOR EYES OF- YES I AM I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF EIGHTY USE I THINK IT'S A GREAT WAY OF ADDRESSING ONE PORTION OF HOUSING I'M I'M I HAVE TO CATCH UP AND TALK TO FOLKS AND- IN MY DISTRICT AND I HAVE THIS MIXED OF FEELING OF NOT ON YOUR BILL BUT JUST ON THE IMPACTS OF EIGHTY USE WE HAVE THOSE WHO HAVE COME FROM THE OUTSIDE YOU KNOW. A BIG BUSINESSES THAT COME IN AND BUY THE PROPERTY AND YOU KNOW THEY'LL ATTACH AND- OR A BUILDING EIGHTY YOU NOT ALWAYS TO THE PART TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE- AND YOU KNOW BRING IN A LOT OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE TOOK TO RENT THEM. AND THEN YOU HAVE. THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE DISTRICT IN THE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ALSO LOING TERM THEY REALLY BUILD THEM HOWEVER THEY CAN PATCH IT TOGETHER AND IT BECOMES THAT. SO I GUESS I'M IM NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS ALL FITS IN WITH YOUR BILLS RIGHT AND I'M I INTEND TO GO BACK AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT- I JUST WONDERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON. THAT KIND OF IT AND IT'S LED TO ENORMOUS OVERCROWDING- IN CERTAIN PARTS SO JUST YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THIS COULD FIT IN AND HELP SO THERE'S A PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT WILL ALLOW THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THERE'S NO WE DON'T MAKE ANY APPROPRIATION HERE. BUT WE ALLOW PART OF THAT OF THE CALL THE HOUSING BUNDLE THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT EIGHTY USE WOULD BE ALLOWED SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK OUT IF THEY DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO GIVE. GRANTS THE PEOPLE I MEAN I THINK WE GENERALLY. PUT PEOPLE IN A. B. C. D. GROUP YOU KNOW A BEING I GOT CASH I GOT EQUITY I GOT NO PROBLEM GET MY FINANCING. B. IS EITHER HAVE A LOT OF EQUITY I HAVE A LOT OF CASH SO I CAN DO IT IT'S THE CND WERE PEOPLE. ACTUALLY NEED THE- STABILITY OF ADDITIONAL INCOME OR VICKY SAID THEY HAVE MORE PEOPLE LIVING ON THE PROPERTY THAT AREN'T THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE FINANCING YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES THE BANKS WILL NOT GIVE YOU YOUR EXPECTED- THREE FIVE REVENUE TO YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM FROM- THE RED DAY WE SAY WE'VE GOT TO BUILD IT BEFORE YOU CAN. WILL GET THE RENT SO THAT THIS JUICE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS AND ALLOWS FOR THE FUNDING FOR THE EIGHTY YEARS IS NOT PROHIBITED NOW BUT WE JUST. PUT IT IN THERE TO TACK IT THAT THAT WILL GO IN SO. THAT'S IN OUR- I WISH I WAS HERE FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS TO TACKLE THAT. THAT PROBLEM BUT WE ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF THOSE THINGS BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING BECAUSE- IT IS THESE HAVE BEEN BUILT IN. THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY ARE OPEN TO HIM A COUNTY OR IN DOWNTOWN LA PEOPLE SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND PEOPLE. REALIZE HOW THEY'VE HE PROVIDED THAT CAN COME A PROVIDED. THAT THE KIDS COMING. COMING BACK- SEVEN. HIS WILL MORE QUESTION. ON THE- ON THE M. AMNESTY PARDON THAT THAT'S IF YOU APPLY. TO BUILD UP OR REBUILD IT WHAT WHAT IS THE AMNESTY PEACE COME IN AS AN AND IF AND IF YOU'RE BELOW THE YOU KNOW THE PART WHERE YOU SHOULD BE. ARE YOU. YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU TREATING YOURSELF IN BUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO AN EXCHANGE AND THAT'S- THAT'S HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE SO WE KNOW THAT. THERE WERE. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EIGHTY USE BUILT FROM THE SEVENTIES TILL TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT NEVER GOT THE PERMIT BECAUSE THEY WENT INTO THE STATE THEY WILL WENT INTO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT WERE TOLD THEY COULDN'T GET IT AND PEOPLE DECIDED FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT THEY WOULD BUILD IT. THAT WAS NOT SUBSTANDARD HOUSING WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A PERMIT BUT MOST OF IT WAS BUILT FOR THE CODE AT THE TIME SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE SAID WE NEEDED A PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN AS YOU SAID THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO. HAVE THREE SHUT DOWN SO WE'VE LANDED ON OR WE LANDED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ON HEALTH AND SAFETY WHOSE LONG ISSUE REACHED THE HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT IT IN WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS NOW IF YOU BUILDING INSPECTOR GOES INTO A RENTAL UNIT BECAUSE- THE CITY OR JURISDICTION. NORMALLY WHAT THEY DO IS THEY LOOK AROUND OUT OF WALLS PEELING DOWN THEY TAKE THE THEIR GADGET AND PUT IT IN ONE OF THE PLUGS TO SEE IF THE ELECTRICITY IS GROUNDED IF IT'S NOT GROUNDEDTHE SAY YOU GOT A GROUNDOUT RIGHT SO THEY THEY DO THAT BUT THEY DON'T. COME IN AND RIP UP THE- THE WHOLE HOUSE BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND IT'S FORTY HER IS ALSO AT NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO IT WAS IS THAT WE SO. THAT'S THE PATHWAY AND WE'RE HAVING WE'RE HAVING SOME SUCCESS BECAUSE SOME. WE WANT THOSE. TO BE LEGALIZED LEVINE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THEM FOR WHATEVER REASON SO WE DON'T. AND IN MY YOU KNOW I DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE- ANALYSIS I THINK THAT ONCE YOU LEGALIZE. THEN MAYBE YOU'LL IMPROVE IT BECAUSE YOU CAN NOW. ADVERTISES A LEGAL UNIT INSTEAD OF HUSH HUSH HUSH. AND MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE DOWN THE GARAGE DOOR AND PUT IN A WINDOW AND A REAL TO OUR RIGHT. AS LONG AS YOU'RE AS LONG AS YOU PASS IT TOO SO THERE'S FRICTION THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THAT WHAT COMES FIRST WE LET THE PEOPLE. GET LEGAL- AND THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE CITY'S AND WE KNOW THERE'S SO MANY OF THESE UNITS DOWN. THE THINKING IS THAT. LEGALIZE THEM AND HAVE LET THE CITY. ACCOUNT FOR THEM WITH THE READING NUMBERS TO REACH THE REGIONAL NUMBERS THAT THEY CAN'T AND THEN WORK WITH THE HOMEOWNERS TO. TO BRING UP THE CALL THE LISTEN JUST LIKE YOU WANT. NO I LIVE IN A SIXTY YEAR OLD HOUSE A LOT OF MY NEIGHBORS HAVE THE ORIGINAL WINDOWS. I'D LIKE FOR THEM TO. IMPROVE WE ALL WANT THAT SO THAT'S THE THEORY. THE YOU.

WILL MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR CENTER GROVE SB. TEN SEVENTY THREE. THE FLOOR IS YOURS SENATOR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THIRTY WILL GOOD MORNING MISS MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP TEN SEVENTY THREE WHICHIS A REINTRODUCTION OF LAST YEAR'S SB SIX FIFTY EIGHT WHICH PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE FIVE ZERO. THIS YEAR'S BILL IS ONCE AGAIN SPONSORED BY SAMPOERNA DINO- ASSESSOR RECORDER COUNTY CLERK BOB DUTTON THE MEASURE AUTHORIZED THE COUNTY ASSESSORS- TOUGH OFFER A PARTIAL PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION FOR DISABLED VETERANS PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OF DISABILITY RATING DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR THE MILITARY SERVICE IN WHICH THE VETERAN WAS DISCHARGED OTHER STATES OFFER PROPERTY TAX CREDITS IN VARYING DEGREES. AND MANY OTHER MANY ALLOW VETERANS TO QUALIFY WOULD DISABILITY RATINGS LESS THAN 1100% INCLUDING FLORIDA ILLINOIS AND TEXAS. CURRENTLY DISABLED VETERANS- MAY REQUEST A REDUCTION ON THE THEIR HOMES ASSESSED VALUE FOR THE PURPOSES OF DIFFERENT TERMINATE PROPERTY TAX IF THEY'RE 1100% DISABLED BLIND IN BOTH EYES OR HAVE LOST. TO WERE MORE LIMBS. IF TO SEIZE THE VETERANS SURVIVING SPOUSE MAY ALSO QUALIFY. HOWEVER WITHOUT THIS BILL A VETERAN WITH A LIFE CHANGING 50% DISABLED GRADING WOULD CONTINUE TO BE AN ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION ON THEIR DISABILITY RATING. ALONE NEW DATA PROVIDED BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS GAINED AN ADDITIONAL TEN THOUSAND DISABLED VETERANS. AND LESS WITH LESS THAN 1100% DISABLED RATING SINCE JUST AST YEAR THIS BRINGS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DISABLED VETERANS TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND. WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR OUR CURRENT STATE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. THE CALIFORNIA SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE REPORT FOR TWENTY TWENTY IDENTIFIED CALIFORNIA'S HAVING THE LARGEST NUMBER OF VETERANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. ALMOST ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IN ITS ASSESSMENT IN THE COMMITTEE SHOW THAT THE HOMELESS VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENTED 31% OF THE NATIONAL HOMELESS VETERAN POPULATION. ADDITIONALLY CALIFORNIA HAD THE HIGHEST RATE OF AND SHELTERED VETERANS ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND IN THAT SAME YEAR EXPERIENCED A THREE POINT 8% OVERALL INCREASE IN VETERAN HOMELESSNESS. SB TEN SEVENTY THREE COULD BE THAT SAVING GRACE FOR THAT VETERAN HELPING THEM TO KEEP THEIR HOME AND GET THEM THROUGH THE HARDSHIP UNTIL THEY CAN GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. THOUGH THOUGH THERE S NO AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL BENEFIT THAT CAN EQUAL THE AMOUNT OF LOSS THAT VETERANS HEAD MAY FACE THIS BILL EXPANDS ON THE ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAM AIMED TO ASSIST. CALIFORNIA'S DISABLED VETERANS PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO STRUGGLING VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ON THE PHONE WITH ME TODAY IS FORMER STATE SENATOR BOB DENTON. WHO IS IT ASSESSOR RECORDER COUNTY CLERK FOR SAMPOERNA DINO COUNTY. IN THIS BILL SPONSORED AND AS WELL AS SETH READ REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA VETERANS READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO FORMER SENATOR BOB DENTON WELCOME. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I AM THE AS A COUNTY ASSESSOR PERCENT MEDINA COUNTY WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE TO SPONSOR SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY THREE. LEGISLATION THAT WAS INTRODUCED BY SENATOR GROW. THAT AMEND SECTION TWO OH FIVE POINT FIVE IS REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE. THE BILL TEN SEVENTY THREE WOULD EXPAND ELIGIBILITY OF THE DISABLED VETERANS EXEMPTION BY ALLOWING THE COUNTY ASSESSOR. TO APPLY A PARTIAL THIS IS DISABILITY. VETERANS EXEMPTION EQUAL TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE DISABILITY THE VETERAN IS RATED VETERANS EXEMPTION IS AVAILABLE ONLY- IF THE VETERAN IS 1100% DISABLED. BE TOTALLY DISABLED THAT MEANS THE VA. WILK THE VA THEY DID OR THE MILITARY TO DISCHARGE THE VETERAN WITH A DISABILITY RATING OF A 100% DUE TO AN INJURY HE SUSTAINED WAY SERVING OUR COUNTRY. OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND VETERANS RESIDE SAMBAR DINO COUNTY WITH A SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY READING OF THOSE FOUR THOUSAND VETERANS HAVE A ONE SO 1100% DISABILITY RATING. THIS MEANS THAT DISABLED VETERANS EXEMPTION ONLY APPLIES 216% OF DISABLED VETERANS OF SAMBAR DINO COUNTY. YOU HAVE A VETERAN AS- DISABILITY READING OF NINETY PERCENT. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO QUALIFY FOR THIS EXEMPTION TOO OFTEN COUNTY SAYS USER FOUR STRAIGHT AWAY. DISABLED VETERANS SEEKING THIS EXEMPTION SB TEN SEVENTY THREE SEEKS TO HELP OUR DISABLED VETERANS THE BILL WE ESTIMATED THE STATE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE WOULD BE REDUCED BY A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THE STATE ALREADY COLLECTS MORE THAN SIXTY BILLION IN PROPERTY TAXES THE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR IF THAT WAS THE CASE WITH ONLY A QUICK TWO POINT 3% OF TOTAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED AMONG THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES OF THE STATE. IN THE LAST DECADE KENNY ASSESSOR ASSESSMENT TAX ROLLS HAVE GROWN ON AVERAGE OF 5% PER YEAR. SO IT'S NOT REALLY A LOSS YES YOU WE YOU KNOW ABOUT THE POINT THREE PERCENT- LIST PROPERTY TO EXPOSE ALSO KEEP IN MIND TO NOT ALL VETERANS. OWN HOMES. AND THAT THE NUMBER WAS BASED. ON LIKE A 100% FIGURE- WOULD SEEM THAT WOULD BE. NOW WITH THE SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN SURPLUS THAT THE STATE CURRENTLY IT HAS IT. IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO TO KIND OF HELP ADD AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT. ONE OF THE THINGS THE KELLY SAYS TO THE REALLY- AND BOTHERS ME IS THAT WILL HAVE THAT FRIENDS OF PLY FOR THESE EXEMPTIONS AND THEN WE HAVE THE YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT RATED A 100% THAT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU AND THAT REALLY IS BECAUSE IT REALLY BOTHERS ME SHOWING GROVER FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE- I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE SERVE PROVIDE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO OUR NATION'S AND DISABLED VETERANS. THEY'VE MADE A GREAT SACRIFICE WAY SERVING OUR COUNTRY AND ARE DESERVING OF THIS BENEFIT. I WANT TO THANK YOU AND I WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON NOW TO SET TO READ. WHO IS ALSO ON THE PHONE. SHARES GOOD MORNING CARE NUMBERS MY NAME IS SET TO READ WITH THREE DIFFERENT RELATIONS. I'M INFANTRY COMBAT VETERAN TO THE POINT. I'M A DISABLED VETERAN BUT LESS THAN 1100% DISABILITY RATING UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT KNOW HOW THE DISABILITY COMPENSATION PROCESS WORKED AND EVEN THOUGH ALL MY DISABILITIES COMBINE TODAY ARE OVER A 100% IT IS UNLIKELY I WILL EVER REACH THE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. COMPENSATION Q. TO WHAT IS VETERANS CALL BE A MATH FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE COMPENSATED AT 60% DISABILITY AND FILE FOR AN INCREASE OR NEW BENEFIT. AND ARE GRANTED A 20% DISABILITY FOR THAT NEW CLAIM OR INCREASED WE WILL REMAIN AT THE 60% PAY SCALE FOR YOUR DISABILITY. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A CONFUSING TOPIC SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH ANY MEMBER THAT MORE IN DEPTH CONVERSATION IF NEEDED. RECENTLY AT VA ANNOUNCED PLANS TO UPDATE THEIR SCHEDULE FOR RATING DISABILITIES THE OFFICIALS SAY THE CHANGES LIKELY WILL RESULT IN HIGHER DISABILITY RATINGS FOR VETERANS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS BUT- YOU WERE WEALTHY QUALIFYING FOR DISABILITY COMPENSATIO. COMPENSATION FOR SUCH THINGS AS. TITUS AND SLEEP APNEA. ACTION RESULT INDEED. BENEFITS FOR SOME FROM. YEAH REMOVE THEM THE BANK BAKER RECEIVE. SB TEN THIRTY THREE TEN MUCH NEEDED BENEFIT FOR DISABLED VETERAN HOMEOWNERS AND WOULD HELP ENCOURAGE. FIRST TIME DISABLED VETERAN HOMEBUYERS BIGGEST BENEFIT IS THAT THIS BILL WOULD ACCOMPLISH BIGGEST BENEFIT IN THIS BILL WOULD ACCOMPLISH IS HELPING SOME HOMELESS VETERANS GET INTO A HOME.

PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATORS CAPITO HI CABALLERO HI NIELSEN ALL RIGHT NIELSEN HI DURAZO. TERRAZZO HI HERTZBERG ALL RIGHT HERTZBERG HI WIENER. WIENER HI FIVE ZERO THE BILL IS OUT FIVE TWO ZERO AND CENTER GILLETTE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICES WELL WE DON'T SAY IT ENOUGH. VERY GOOD WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER SIX DOT SIX ON THE AGENDA IT IS A BILL BY SENATOR WELCOME- SENATOR NELSON IF I MADE A MADAM CHAIR I WOULD REQUEST PERMISSION TO PRESENT THIS FOR CENTER WILK AT HIS REQUEST ABSOLUTELY SENATOR AND IF I'M ABLE JUST PRESENT FROM RIGHT HERE CAN PRESENT FROM THE FROM THE DICE IF YOU LIKE THIS IS A CENTER WORKS BILL IS S. B. THIRTEEN FIFTY THREE AS- PRESENTED BY SENATOR NIELSEN MAY PROCEED WITH THIS MEASURE IS I THINK KIND OF CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA DEALING. WITH THE HOMELESS. PROBABLES TRAVAIL IN CRISIS IT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY THE STATE AND LOCALITIES ON HOMELESS PROGRAM EXPENDITURES AND OUTCOMES. I WOULD ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH SENATOR WILK AND HIS STAFF ON THESE MEASURES SO WE WILL ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS AMENDED THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REPORT TO THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL. SPECIFIED INFORMATION ON THIS HOMELESS POPULATION AS WELL AS THE EXPENDITURES ON HOMELESS PROGRAMS FOR THEIR JURISDICTIONS BUT JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE COUNCIL WILL BE CHARGED TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IMPOSED ON LINE BUT JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS FOR SURE OVER THE YEARS WITH OUR HOMELESS. POPULATION. BUT I TEND TO CHARACTERIZE AND I'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS ISSUE AS ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO ENSURE HAVE. BUT I CHARACTERIZE HOW THIS HAS DEALT WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION. AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE- ABSTRACT ARTIST. WHO COMES INTO A WHITE PAINTED ROOM WITH THE BUCKET. LET'S JUST START WITH THE BRUSH SPLASHING. THE PAINT ON THE WALL. NOW I AM VERY INVOLVED IN THE ART COMMUNITY AND ALWAYS HAVE THE- THEN THAT IS IN THE DARK. BUT IN TERMS OF THE STATE. WHAT THAT REPRESENTS IS ALL WE'RE DOING IS THROWING MONEY AT THAT THANKS. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO BRING SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND FOCUS ON NOT JUST. THROWING MONEY AT IT BUT ENSURING. THAT THERE ARE RESULTS FOR THE MONEY EXPENDED. SURELY THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM IS NOT APPLICABLE JUST TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND POPULATION. THAT APPLIES TO MOST EVERYTHING WE DO AND GOVERNMENT ATTEMPT TO BRING SOME SETS. SENSE AND PURPOSE TO DEALING WITH THE HOMELESS. THERE'S BEEN A RECENTLY LAUNCHED HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM. THE WEBSITE IN PLACE NOW IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT INFORMATION IS STILL LACKING. AS IF POPULATION INFORMATION AS PRESENTED IS LIMITED. THE BILL AS A STEP FURTHER INTO THE DIRECTION WHICH OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY TAKEN INCLUDING WASHINGTON WHICH TRACKS ALL FUNDING AND EXPENDITURE FOR EVERY HOMELESS PROJECT. IN THE STATE FROM EVERY FUNDING SOURCE TO IDENTIFY SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS ON WHICH IT COULD EXPAND AND FOCUS ON GREATER EFFORT. EXPEND FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR SUCH PURPOSES. THIS BILL WAS INSPIRED BY THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF TWO STATE AUDITS LAST YEAR. ONE WAS IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX. ONE WAS IN TWENTY TWENTY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT WE'RE DOING. IT HAS DISTURBED ME AS I'VE WATCHED COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT. STRUGGLE WITH HOMELESSNESS. BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN CLEARLY EVIDENT THAT THERE'S NOT BEEN MUCH WITH THIS ISSUE. OF COORDINATION. AND BENEFITING FROM POSITIVE EXPERIENCES OF ANY PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS A BILL I THINK THAT BRINGS ACCOUNTABILITY BY PROVIDING INFORMATION THAN MEASURES. THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE. MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. WE HAVE CHRIS. PATELLA INVENTS CABLE NOW THESE ARE SENIOR AUDITORS IN THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THEY ARE PRESENTING HERE JUST FOR INFORMATION'S SAKE THEN MAYBE IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS THEY ARE NOT FORMALLY TAKING ANY POSITION BUT WE DO HAVE THEM AVAILABLE. OF THOSE GENTLEMAN HERE. THERE WE GO THANK YOU SIR PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS VANCE CABLE AND I'M A SENIOR AUDITOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. AS SENATOR NIELSEN INDICATED THE STATE AUDITOR DOES NOT TAKE A POSITION AGAINST OR FOR PROPOSED LEGISLATION HOWEVER THAT BEING SAID SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FIFTY THREE WHAT ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN AN AUDIT REPORT THAT WE ISSUED OUT HOMELESSNESS- IN FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR. THOSE CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY WERE THAT THE STATE DID NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IT SPEND STATE FUNDS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. AND AT THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO COLLECT COMPREHENSIVE DATA AS PART OF THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM. MAY BE LIMITED BECAUSE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO RECEIVE STATE FUNDING ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ENTER INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PROGRAMS. MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS PATEL IS AVAILABLE I CAN ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT AUDIT. DURING THE SUBSEQUENT AUDIT WE RAISE THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT HISTORICALLY COLLECTED ANALYZED OR REPORTED DATA. USING OUTCOME MEASURES FOR ANY OF ITS HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS NUMBER OF OUTPUTS RELATED TO FIGHTING HOMELESSNESS SUCH AS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING AWARDED AND THE NUMBER OF APARTMENTS OR HOMES THAT WERE FUNDED- THAT WERE PRESERVED CREATED AND REHABILITATED. HCD DOES NOT REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES THAT DESCRIBED WHETHER ITS ACTIONS WERE AFFECTED OF A REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. MEASURING OUTCOMES IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW WELL THE STATE USES ITS FUNDING. BUT ALSO TO INFORM FUTURE EFFORTS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA COULD BENEFIT FROM COLLECTING ANALYZING AND REPORTING OUTCOME INFORMATION AS WE FOUND THE STATE OF WASHINGTON HAS DONE. MISTER PATEL AND I ARE AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD HI MISTER PATEL DID YOU WISH TO SPEAKER JUST ANSWER QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD HELLO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THIS WE ARE- REQUESTING THAT ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PLEASE STEP FORWARD.

TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTEEN FIFTY THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME ONE ZERO. AND HERE NOBODY'S QUEUING UP IT WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. SENATOR EYES SO. JUST QUESTION WHETHER IT IS TO CENTER NIELSEN OR THE AUDITOR IS. DID YOU I'M SORRY I DIDN'T READ THE- THE REPORT OF THE AUDITORS REPORT BUT IS ANY OF THIS- INFORMATION BEING COLLECTED AT. ANY LEVEL WHAT WHAT DID YOU FIND AS FAR AS- THE INFORMATION THAT. IS OUT THERE ARE WE STARTING FROM SCRATCH OR ARE WE ADDING TO SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY THERE. YES HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CHRIS PATEL FOR THE RECORD I'M WITH A COMPANY STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I WAS THE SUPERVISOR THAT OVERSAW THE AUDIT OF THE- CONTINUANCE OF CARE WHICH WE ISSUED LAST YEAR IN FEBRUARY- SO THIS DATA IS BEING COLLECTED- FOR THE C. O. C. PROGRAM TO CONTINUE OF CARE PROGRAM WHICH IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM- IT IS ADMINISTERED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE MONEY GOES STRAIGHT TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS- WITHIN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE- THEY ARE BY LAW REQUIRED- TO- SUBMIT CERTAIN DATA WITHIN THE- THE SYSTEM THAT THEY USE WHICH IS CALLED THE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM. HOWEVER MANY OF THE OTHER STATE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD OF MONEY THAT IS- PROVIDED THROUGH THE STATE PROGRAMS- THEY MAY NOT BE ACQUIRING- THAT THE COLLECTS OF. ANY ANY OF THE STATE. SO THERE'S- INFORMATION THAT. IS THAT IS THAT THE YOU SAID THE FEDERAL PROGRAM- ADMINISTERED THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT INFORMATION THAT GOES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T COME TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT. THAT IS CORRECT CURRENTLY THERE IS NO MECHANISM AND AT THE STATE LEVEL TO COLLECT ALL THE INFORMATION- AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL- THAT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE- THE H. D. I. A SYSTEM THAT THE STATE WAS PLANNING TO IMPLEMENT. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENIOR FOR THE QUESTIONS I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. OUR MOTION FOLKS.

REMOVE THE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS SB FOURTEEN OH FIVE BY SENATOR OCHO A VOTE. WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. WHAT. PERFECT HEIGHT. I DO AGREE WITH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE CONSULTANT ANTHONY FOR THEIR HARD WORK IN THIS BILL. I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THE COMMUNITY OF LIKE YOUR HEAD IS A UNIQUE MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY LOCATED IN SAN MARINO MOUNTAINS THAT IS FAIRLY ISOLATED AT FIVE THOUSAND FEET IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREA OF SAN BERNADINO COUNTY. CURRENTLY THE COMPANY CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS REFERRED TO AS CCN OURS IN ERROR HEAD WOULD ARE ENFORCED BY THE ERRO HEAD WITH ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE KNOWN AS- IRAQ. WHICH IS WHAT WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY A GROUP OF CONCERNED AT LAKE ARROWHEAD RESIDENTS IN NINETEEN TWENTY THREE TO PRESERVE THE UNIQUE GLORIOUS SCENERY OF LAKE ARROWHEAD. BECAUSE OF A LACK WAS FORMED BEFORE THE DAVIS STERLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT IT WAS NOT BORN AS AN H. AWAY AND THEREFORE DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CHARGE FEES TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR OPERATIONS. THE ONLY REVENUE THE ORGANIZATION RECEIVED IS FROM THE APPLICATION FEES AND PENALTY FEE. PENALTY FEES. UP FOR LACK OF COMPLIANCE WHICH ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR A WORK WHICH IS A NONPROFIT TO COLLECT. WITH TEN THOUSAND PARCELS ENFORCEMENT IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR A WHACK. ONLY IN IRAQ ONLY HAS ONE FULL TIME AND ONE PART TIME STAFF PERSON. AS A RESULT REVENUE GENERATION IS UNCERTAIN ANY GIVEN YEAR AND COST INCREASES AND LEGAL CHALLENGES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE COST. FOR THESE REASONS THEY ARE FACED WITH A FINANCIAL CRISIS. THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE REQUESTED THAT THE LAKE ARROWHEAD COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT KNOWN AS LA CST. TAKE OVER THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE CCN OURS IN ARROWHEAD WOODS. L. A. CST IS ONE OF THE FEW LOCALLY ELECTED AGENCIES IN THE AREA THEY CURRENTLY PROVIDE WATER SERVICES TO THE PROPERTIES IN ERRO HEAD BOARDS AND THEIR STAFF ARE ALREADY IN THE FIELD VISITING PROPERTIES ON A DAILY BASIS. THIS PUTS THEM IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO MONITOR AND ENFORCE COMPLIANCE IN A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS L. A. CST NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED AUTHORIZATION TO ADD THE ENFORCEMENT OF CCN OURS TO ITS POWERS. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION SIXTY ONE ONE ZERO FIVE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THEIR UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXIST IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT JUSTIFIED THE ENACTMENT OF SPECIAL FIX STATUTES FOR SPECIFIC DISTRICTS. AND WE BELIEVE THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST IN THIS CASE. IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE LAKE ARROWHEAD COMMUNITY S. B. FOURTEEN ZERO FIVE ADDS THE LAKE ARROWHEAD COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT TO THE LIST OF COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. SIX ONE ONE ZERO FIVE. BETTER AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE CCN OURS. JOINING ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CATHERINE SERI. ON BEHALF OF LAKE ARROWHEAD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT AND CC LYFORD ON BEHALF OF THE ERROR HEAD WOODS ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE ALSO JOINING ON THE LINE WILL BE JOE BURN WITH L. A. CST TO WHO IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. VERY GOOD I HAVE- JOSEPH BYRNE- AND CATHERINE SERI AS THE TWO WITNESSES I THINK YOU MENTIONED SOMEONE ELSE CATHERINE YES WE HAD- WHAT C. YES CATHERINE AND STACY LEIPER.

LIBRARY YES CATHERINE'S JERRY OKAY VERY GOOD- WE WILL- ASK STACY LEIBER IF- IF YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING THIS IS STACEY LIPPERT I'M WITH THE ARROWHEAD WITH ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE. ZERO WITH ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE IS SEEKING A PARTNER TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE CCN OURS. FOR A HUNDRED YEARS THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE TASKED WITH ENFORCING THE FIFTEEN HOURS TO PRESERVE THE CHARACTER OF THE YEAR OKAY WITH. HE LACKED THE SAKE THE RESOURCES TO SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT AND ENFORCE THE CCN OURS PART TIME EMPLOYEE. L. A. FIFTY ON THE OTHER HAND ALREADY SERVED WATER TO VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE PROPERTIES AND THE TRACK. HAVE STAFF THAT ARE OUT IN THE FIELD EVERY DAY AND INTERACT PROPERTY OWNERS THREE SOUTHEAST AREA ON A DAILY BASIS. THE DOCKING AND COMMUNICATION ABILITY WOULD ENABLE IRAQ TO BETTER EDUCATE ALL PROPERTY OWNERS WITHIN ERRO HEADLIGHTS. AND BETTER ENFORCE THE CCN OURS. THAT'S THE FOUND IN MEXICO OVER 20% OF PROPERTIES IN ERRO HEAD FLICK HAS TRANSFERRED OWNERSHIP THE NEW PROPERTY OWNERS ARE MODIFIED OF PROPERTIES WHICH REQUIRE COMMITTEE ON A VERY LARGE SCALE. IRAQ IS FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH THE MAN.EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT UTILITY AND FLOOD OF NEW OWNERS CERTAIN. OF STANDARDS CONSTRUCTION IN BE ERROL HAD WITH AREA ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNS THAT ARE HARMONIOUS TO THE SURROUNDING HOMES AND LANDSCAPES. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE ARE SEEKING A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE L. A. CST AND HOPE YOU WILL SEE THAT AND AFFIRMATIONS BOAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE AVAILABILITY OF. THE VCRS AND PRESERVING- OF THE- HECKLER CATHERINE SERI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND NOT VERY DIGITAL MANAGER OF THE LAKE ARROWHEAD COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL ALONG WITH A LACK.

OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THOUGHT I MIGHT GET LUCKY AND- SLIP THE CUTE HERE BUT- FREESHEET YOUR TIME AND I REALLY WANT TO FIRST START OFF BY NOT JUST ACCEPTING THE MEMBERS LIST IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGES TO THOSE ARE COMMENTS TWO AND THREE BUT- THANK YOUR STAFF FOR MAKING THIS MUCH BETTER BILL- THEY ROUNDED IT OUT- PUTS IN KEY DETAILS IN THERE. WE PUT A FINER POINT ON WHAT I THINK IS THE ESSENCE OF THIS BILL IS THAT EVERY PERSON REGARDLESS WHERE YOU LIVE IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITY ACCESS OPEN SPACE IT CHANGES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. WEALTHIER YOU KNOW LIVE ON A HILLSIDE OR MOUNTAIN SIDE- AND WE'RE HOPING HERE IS THAT THIS BILL STIMULATE A CONVERSATION WITH LEADERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALL AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO LOOK AT UPDATES THEIR OPEN SPACE ELEMENTS WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT BEING PUT INTO OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE GENERAL PLAN BUT- WE THINK HIS EMPHASIS ON THE OPEN SPACE ELEMENT. AND TAKING EQUITY INTO ACCOUNT- TAKING RESILIENCE INSERT OPPORTUNITIES TO GO BEYOND JUST OUR TRADITIONAL MOTIVE GOING THROUGH CONSERVANCIES ARE GOING THROUGH SORT OF- AGENCIES THAT ALREADY HAVE OPPORTUNITY SET UP TO MAKE THOSE ACQUISITIONS IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GETTING HEADED IS. IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFYING LANDS- AND REALLY PUTTING EQUITY FIRST I THINK WE CAN MAKE SOME SERIOUS PROGRESS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES HEALTHIER AND HAPPIER- WE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DETAILS OF YOUR ONE AND THERE'S A THERE'S MANY CITIES THAT HAVEN'T UPDATED THEIR- OPEN SPACE ELEMENTS FOR MANY DECADES- THIS IS TRUE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS CENTRAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- BUT WE REALLY WANT THIS TO BE A CLATTER PROCESS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO WE'RE HOPING THAT- IF THE BILL SHOULD MOVE FOR WE CAN KEEP. WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN AND TRY TOSEEK SOME RESOLUTION THE LAST THEY WERE JUST NOTE THE IMPORTANT OTHER CHANGE MADE IS THE COUPLING THIS FROM THE HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE AND SETTING A DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX I THINK WILL PROVIDE A LOT OF CLARITY BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE CONFUSION AS TO HOW LINKING THOSE WOULD ACTUALLY WORK SO THIS IS NOW DECOUPLED FROM THE HOUSING PROCESS AND YOU JUST- ON HIS OWN FOR STANDALONE.

OTHERWISE INCLUDED EVERY I'M LOOKING IN YOUR REMEMBER YOUR HUSBAND CAME TO ME ON A BILL WE HAD TO MAKE A NUMBER OF CHANGES WAY BACK WHEN AND WE'VE DONE THIS OVER THE YEARS WHERE. WHERE THE LAW.% DOESN'T ISN'T REALLY IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE. WE HAVE CALIFORNIA SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS ENSURING A HIGH LEVEL OF COMPETENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE ON OUR PUBLIC PROJECTS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THIS RESULTS IN PUBLIC AGENCIES AND TAXPAYERS RECEIVING THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CONSTRUCTION IN FORT UNFORTUNATELY AS I JUST SAID DESPITE CLEAR RULES NOT ALL CONTRACTORS IT HERE TO THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE LAW. THAT IS CLEARLY PART OF WHAT CALIFORNIA IS ALL ABOUT IN THIS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THE FINISHING CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WHICH INCLUDES THE INSTALLATION AND OR PURCHASE OF CARPET. RESILIENT FLOORING SYNTHETIC TURF OR LIGHTING FIXTURES THIS MEASURE IMPORTANTLY REINFORCES CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FISHING INDUSTRY THUS ENSURING WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ALL ALONG.

PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATORS CAPITO I CARILLO HI NIELSEN AYE NIELSEN AYE DURAZO TERRAZZO HI HERTZBERGHERTZBERG HI WIENER. FORTY ZERO FORTY ZERO WILL PUT THAT ON CALL AND- MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BILL. THAT BILL THIS PAST THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN WHICH IS SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SEVEN SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THE DATA IS STRONG WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. AT HOUSING CRISIS IS BROADLY STALKED ABOUT ENOUGH PLACE NOT ENOUGH PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN WE'RE NOT BUILDING AND THEN ANOTHER HOUSING NOW WHAT IS THAT HOUSING LOOK LIKE IS IT ALL TAX SUBSIDIZED. AFFORDABLE HOUSING WARS ARE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE HOME OWNERSHIP AND SO THIS BILL KIND OF TURNS THE ARGUMENT I HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSING PLAN HERE HOW MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SPENDING OF TAX DOLLARS ON HOUSING BUT THIS TURNS THE IDEA ON ITS HEAD. IT BASICALLY HAS CERTAIN VERY CORE ELEMENTS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO FIRST WE WANT TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WE DON'T WANT TO JUST HAVE A PLAN THAT JUST SAYS YOU CAN BUY YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE BECAUSE WE HAVE AN AD THE NEW HOUSING AND SECONDLY WHEN SOME FAMILY THAT COMES INTO BY THE HOUSE IT LEAKY PIPES AND LEAKY ROOF SHE WANNA GIVE A BRAND NEW CONSTRUCTION. SO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN HAVE A HOUSING PLAN THAT RESULTS IN MORE CONSTRUCTION TO YOU WANT TO HAVE A HOUSING PLAN THAT DOESN'T COST TAXPAYERS MONEY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A SURPLUS NOW THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT DOESN'T HAVE LAST FOR EVER THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME WE SEE THAT GO UP AND DOWN. AND WE SEEN THAT THERE'S OTHER BIG CHALLENGES FOR GOVERNMENT TO SPEND ITS RESOURCES CAN YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING WITHOUT USING TAX DOLLARS THAT CREATE HOUSING THIRD WE WANT TO PUT GOOD JOBS PEPLE TO WORK AND WE WANT THIS TO ALL BE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND THERE'S ALWAYS AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT THE HOUSING SECTOR WITH RESPECT TO SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE BUT WE THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN AND WE THINK BY HAVING A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE JUST LIKE I SAID WITH THE LAST BILL YOU GET BETTER QUALITY CONSTRUCTION SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A TEN YEAR LAKE DEFECT LAW BECAUSE YOU GOT. YOU GOT THE BETTER WORK YOU COULD DO THINGS IN A BETTER AND MORE INTELLIGENT WAY AND YOU'RE NOT CREATING A SITUATION WHERE IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE MAKES MINIMUM WAGE THEY CAN'T AFFORD A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE MAYKOP APARTMENT EXCUSE ME AND THE LAST THING IS MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE RICH POOR DIVIDE THE WEALTH GAP. HE KILLING OUR TO. THE RICHER GETTING RICHER. AND THE POOR GETTING POORER. HOME IS WHERE TE WEALTHIEST IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A HOME INSTEAD OF AFTER TEN YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS ALL THEY GOT IS A BIGGER RENT BILL. THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME EQUITY HOW MANY FAMILIES IN PEOPLE'S LIVES HAVE BEEN CHANGED BECAUSE- NOT ONLY THE IMPACTS IN THE- IN YOUR HOME AND YOUR FAMILY. BUT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH. SO HOW DO YOU STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WELL OVER A YEAR WITH A COALITION OF LABOR AND BUSINESS AND- AND LAWYERS AND THE LIKE. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HOW WE WOULD DO THAT. AND WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS A TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BOND. AND IT'S A G. O. BOND DEAL MEANS GENERAL OBLIGATION. WHAT WE DO AND WHY DO WE HAVE A JOB ON MOST YOU'LL BONDS MEAN THAT THE TAXPAYERS PAY THE MONEY THIS IS CALLED THE SELF LIQUIDATING GEO BOND WHY DO WE GO TO THE VOTERS FOR GEO BOND WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE PAID FOR THE MONEY COMES FROM INVESTORS AND IT'S GOING TO BE PAID BACK TO INVESTORS. WE DID IT BECAUSE BY HAVING THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU BY LOWER INTEREST RATE. IF YOU BUY A LOWER INTEREST RATE YOU REDUCE THE COSTS IF YOU INCREASING COST OVER HERE BECAUSE THE CONSTRUCTION COST BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING A FEW DOLLARS TO FAITH FAIR WAGES OVER HERE IF YOU CAN REDUCE THE COST BY HAVING. THE STATE GUARANTEE THE LOAN WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS. SOMEBODY WILL GO TO THE LOCAL BUT BUILT THE DEVELOPER DECIDES TO OPERATE INTO THIS PROGRAM AND THEY SAY WE WANT TO BUILD UNDER THIS PROGRAM THEY'LL GET SOME BENEFITS THEY'LL GET BENEFITS ON BY RIGHT THEY'LL GET BENEFITS ON. ALL ON THESE SECRETS STUFF THAT THAT SANTIAGO DID THOUGH GET BENEFITS ON ON ON REDUCING THE- LIABILITY FOR LLEYTON DEFECTS AND- THEN THEY'LL GET BENEFITS BY VIRTUE OF HAVING SOME LOAN MONEY FOR OFFSITE IMPROVEMENTS FOR COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS. THEN THE CUT WHAT IS THE CUSTOMER GET CUSTOMER GOES TO THE BANK AND THEY HAVE A CREDIT REPORT AND THEY'VE GOT INCOME BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING FOR THE STATE OF THE WORKING FOR WHATEVER IT MAY BE COULD BE STAFFER HERE IN THE BUILDING. AND THEY NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN COULD AFFORD TO BUY THIS BUT WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE A DOWN PAYMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING THE BILLS OF THE DAY THEY CAN'T COME UP WITH THE SCRATCH TO COME UP WITH A DOWN PAYMENT SO WE'RE GONNA LOAN PEOPLE UP TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS- BASICALLY THE ONLY HAVE TO PUT 1% DOWN AND THE REASON WE DID ONE PERCENT. IS WE FOUND THAT FROM ALL THE DATA IF SOMEBODY HAS SOME SKIN IN THE GAME SO TO SPEAK 1% OR SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND HOUSE THEY PUT SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOWN WE PUT THE OTHER HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS DOWN. AND ALL THEY CAN GET THE HOUSE AND THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENT OF A FIXED MORTGAGE MEANS THAT THAT I COULD HAVE RENT INCREASES THE WHOLE. WORLD CHANGES FOR THEM THEIR LIFE CHANGED THEIR FAMILY TREE. AND SO. WHAT HAPPENS HOW DO YOU PAY BACK HOW DO YOU GET THE STATE HOW DOES THE INVESTOR GET THEIR HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK. GOOD QUESTION. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LIEN AGAINST THE HOUSE THE SECOND TRUSTEE. AND WHEN THE HOUSE IS SOLD ADVERTISE TIME IS NINE YEARS WE FIGURED OUT THE MECHANICS IN THE MONEY. SO WITH HOUSES SOLD THE GETS PAID BACK THERE'S IMPUTED INTEREST OF A COUPLE PERCENT. AND GET PAID BACK MOST OF THE MAKE THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY WILL GO TO THE- HOMEOWNER FOR INCREASE. THERE'S NO INCREASE THEN THERE'S NO RISK. THE A AND WE'RE BUILDING THE NECESSARY- LEVERS INTO THE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT WORK. SO BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE DEAL SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE THORNIEST PROBLEMS TO ME THE THORNIEST PROBLEMS IS. WE'VE GOT TO CREATE WEALTH FOR PEOPLE. BECAUSE WHICH JUST GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE THE TENSIONS AND YOU GOT TO GIVE UP OPPORTUNITY. IN ADDITION TO WAGE AN OPPORTUNE TO MAKE MONEY. HOW TO RICH PEOPLE GET RICH THEY LIVE OFF THEIR MONEY. WHAT A POOR PEOPLE DO THEY WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY AND MAKE THEIR BILLS PAID. YOU GOTTA CHANGE UP THE ARCHITECTURE THE FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE. SO THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO HE TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BOND. EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS GOES A LONG PROGRAM SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO DEVELOPERS WHICH GET PAID BACK FOR OFFSIDE IMPROVEMENT SO YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES. THAT DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE- NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE YOU NEED SOME CASH TO MAKE THAT BRIDGE FINANCING. THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE HOMEWORK IN THIS WOMEN LOOKING AT THE SIZING OF IT NOW. THE OPPOSITION COMES IN AND SAYS THIS. IS ALL THE OPPOSITION WONDERFUL PEOPLE TO WORK WITH FOREVER. SAYING WELL YOU'RE GONNA FREEZE OUT THE BOND MARKET BECAUSE- WE WANT MONEY FOR TAX DOLLARS. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YEAH I GET IT. I GET IT. BUT IT TOTALLY KILLS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THIS DEAL BECAUSE OUR WHOLE PURPOSE IS NOT TO GO TO TAXPAYERS AND SAY YOU SHOULD PAY. WE DON'T WANT IF YOU GO OUT AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO SAY AND SPEND FIVE BILLION OR TEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR HOUSING BONDS. WHAT THAT MEANS IS EVERY YEAR COULD HAVE A MORE A PAYMENT ON YOUR GENERAL FUND THAT COMES AHEAD OF EVERYTHING ELSE. EVERY SALARY EVERY OTHER EXPENSE EVERYTHING FOR FOSTER CARE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IN AN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CROWD OUT OTHER IT COSTS. AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WE CAN'T SELL IT IS NOT A COST TO THE TAXPAYER. BUT IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A TAXPAYER DEAL. AND SO I GET THE FACT THAT FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUSINESS WANT TO- YOU KNOW GIVES TAX DOLLARS AND SAY. YOU SHOULDN'T JUST GO TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. BUT THIS IS THE MISSING MIDDLE THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE. TO BE ABLE TO GET ON THE LADDER. YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY. I MEAN IF I HAD MY DRUTHERS WOULD NEVER BE ANOTHER APARTMENT. EVERYBODY WOULD OWN EVERYBODY HAVE A CONDOMINIUM OR A COOPER SOMETHING. OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE WEALTH BECAUSE- LASTING A CLOSE ON THIS WHEN YOU HAVE AN APARTMENT. YOU GOT THAT TAXPAYERS PICKING UP THE TAB FOR ALL THE SUBSIDIES AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TWENTY YEARS. THE RENT GOES UP WITH THE RENT GOES UP. BIG BURDEN ON THE PERSON ISN'T WHO'S A RENTER. SECOND THING THAT HAPPENS IS. THE LANDLORD GETS RICH BECAUSE THE VALUE DEPARTMENT GOES UP. SO WE SPENDING ALL THE MONEY WE'RE CREATINGALL THESE COVENANTS THEY GET TO MAKE THE DOUGH. AND YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO BUILD EQUITY SOCIETY GOES AWAY. SO THIS IS IT. I THINK A PRETTY ELEGANT SOLUTION. TO FIGURING OUT AND THEY'RE STILL HOMEWORK AT SCHOOL GOING TO STILL WORK ON IT. HOUSING COMMITTEE MADE A NUMBER OF THE MINISTERS AND MEMBERS WERE GONNA TAKE TODAY. AND WILL WORK ON IT. AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MEETING WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE ADVOCATES OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STUFF. BUT I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE ON THAT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW. WHAT THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE MISSING MIDDLE IT'S SO IMPORTANT GIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO FOLKS. WE CAN KIDS COME OUT OF COLLEGE. IF WE CAN DO WITH THIS WITH THE STUDENT LOAN WHICH I'M WORKING ON BY THE WAY. AND GET A HOUSE AND GET ON THE LADDER TO MAKE MONEY. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE BIG PICTURE. WE GOT A COUPLE WITNESSES ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS. BUT THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IT'S A IT'S A HARD WORK IT'S A HEAVY LIFT I DON'T DISAGREE. BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S OUR JOB FIGURED OUT FIXING. TO GET AWAY. WITH THAT- S. ZERO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WE HAVE A LET FROM THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES AND MATT CALLAHAN FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP IN HOMEOWNERSHIP ERIN YOU MAY PROCEED IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE. I AM HERE- GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR KABIR ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIN LEHANE ENDED AT FIVE PRIVILEGE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF NEARLY HALF MILLION MEMBERS. OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL CALIFORNIA. SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN. THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING TRADE CURRENTLY AT SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND APPRENTICES TRAINING AT OUR CITY ARE GOING TO CENTERS AROUND THE STATE. THREE QUARTERS OF THE PRODUCT OF THE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ONE FIVE COME FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FIVE PREPARE BY MEN TO USE. YOUNG PEOPLE COME TO THE BUILDING TRADES PRENDAS PROGRAM FOR MANY REASONS AND MANY DIFFERENT GOALS. BUT WHAT WE HEAR OVER AND OVER AGAIN AMERICA IS THAT THERE ARE THREE MAIN THERE ARE FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES AND BUY. A HOUSE SOME DAY. I KNOW HOME. THE DREAM FOR MY IMMIGRANT GRANDPARENTS LEMAY AND- TO THE COUNTRY. WORK IN THE MAIL IN FACT IN THE- AND IT VERY MUCH REMAINS THE DREAM OF BLUE COLLAR BUT ACTUALLY BECAUSE REAL ESTATE PROPERTY DEVELOPERS AND CORPORATE INVESTORS IT'S HARDER AND HARDER TO OBTAIN. SENATOR HERTZBERG BAIL CENTER HERTZBERG FAILED IN A SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE STREET A BILL TO HELP WORKING FAMILIES HAVE A HOME CALDERON TO GET OUT OF THE ENDLESS CYCLE OF RANDY. AND I HAVE A PLACE ULTIMATELY RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. BUT NOVEMBER IDEA IF THEY WERE GROUP OF WOMEN OF. HELLO ANGELES ABOUT THIRTY. IN A WOMEN WHO SPOKE THEIR DESIRE YOU CAN DEFEND IT. INDEPENDENTLY OF ANYBODY IN THE HOUSEHOLD PROVIDE A HOME FOR THEIR FAMILIES. ONE WOMAN REFERRED TO IT AS WELL CATCHING A DURING. OUR OTHER IBM OF OUR FAMILIAR MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ALL WORKING FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP THEM JUDGE THEIR STREAM. DO SO IN A SOCIALLY AND MORALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY THE VALUE THE HARD WORK OF THE BLUE COLLAR WORKERS WHO WILL BUILD CALIFORNIA OUT OF ITS HOUSING CRISIS. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT AT BILL FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN AT FIRST I BOTH TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MATT CALLAHAN. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MATT CALLAHAN WAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTNERS AND HOMEOWNERSHIP. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN. HOMEOWNERSHIP IS A WEALTH BUILDING POWER HOUSE FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. PROVIDES A PREDICTABLE MONTHLY HOUSING EXPENSE THAT ACTUALLY BECOMES MORE AFFORDABLE AS A HOMEOWNERS INCOME INCREASES OVER TIME. HOME OWNERSHIP OFFERS BETTER HOUSING PRESERVATION WHEN FAMILY SPACE THAT PEOPLE FINANCIAL TIMES. PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR FUTURE FINANCIAL GOALS LIKE RETIREMENT. AND IT IS THE MOST DIRECT PATH TO PROVIDING GENERATIONAL WEALTH HOME OWNERSHIP GROWS ATTACK BASE CREATES COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS THE STIMULATE THE ECONOMY AND NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGH OWN HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES WE SEE LOWER CRIME RATES. AND EVEN IMPROVE SCHOOL TEST SCORES. HOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING LANDSCAPING CALIFORNIA. WE SEE THAT THE STATE'S OVERWHELMING- INVESTMENT PROPERTY HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED RENTAL HOUSING PROJECTS THAT GENERATE HUGE FEES FOR DEVELOPERS AND PROPERTY MANAGERS. DO NOT HELP WORKING FAMILIES TAX TO PROVIDE HOUSING THEY REALLY WANT AND THAT'S HOMEOWNERSHIP. AS A STANCE TODAY HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA IS AT RISK OF BECOMING AVAILABLE ONLY TO WEALTHY ELITES. SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN GOES A LONG WAY TO CORRECTING THIS PROBLEM TO PROVIDE BALANCE TO THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING STRATEGY. THE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE FINANCING IT WILL PROVIDE AS A CREATIVE WAY TO FILL THE AFFORDABILITY GAP LOW INCOME HOMEBUYERS FACE AND EFFECTIVELY REMOVES THE SAID THAT SAVINGS THERE. SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WILL LEVERAGE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND PRIVATE MORTGAGE CAPITAL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE STATE'S HOMEOWNERSHIP HOUSING STOCK KAREGA HIGH PAYING JOBS AND IT DOES ALL OF THIS WITHOUT. HITTING THE TAXPAYER'S WALLET. FOR THESE THREE WE SB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND THANK CENTER HERTZBERG CHRISLEY- SHIP IN EXPANDING HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO. WITNESSES TESTIFIED TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED.

WE ACTUALLY OF AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND OUR OPPOSITION IS REALLY JUST FACED ON TO PROVISIONS THE BILL WHICH IRONICALLY THAT TRY TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES BY UNDERMINING EXISTING- AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS IN BOTH INCLUSIONARY LOCAL INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCES AND SB THIRTY FIVE AND SO WE DON'T THINK THESE ARE NECESSARY TO THE CENTRE'S OBJECTIVES OF THE BILL AND THEY ARE UNDERMINE AGAIN THOSE OF INCESSANT INTEROPERATION. THE ISSUE THE SENATOR HERTZBERG MENTIONS ALSO GREAT CONCERN TO US I THINK THE BUILDING ON WHAT THE CONSULTANT IS WRITTEN THE ANALYSIS I THINK THE IDEA THAT THESE ARE SELF LIQUIDATING BONTA SOMEWHAT- UNLIKELY- MOST OF THESE LOANS WOULD BE PAID BACK FOR AT LEAST FIFTEEN OR LONGER YEARS IT'LL BE A LOT OF GENERAL FUND GOING OUT IN THE MEANTIME- AND WE'VE NEVER DONE A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND ET ALONE ONE OF THIS SIZE IT FOR HOUSING IS NOT BEEN BALANCED IN ITS APPROACH LOOKING AT VARIOUS DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES SO WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OWNERSHIP. ONE BIG THAT VERY VERY CLEAR WE ARE VERY SUPPORT OF THIS SENATORS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS WHO DO THINK OF BOND OF THIS SIZE ON THE BALLOT HOPEFULLY WILL BE A BALANCED ONE AMONG VARIOUS HOUSING NEEDS INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS ON THE STREETS EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RENTERS TO. ADD ARE SEVERELY COST BURDENED IN PAYING FOR HOUSING SO WE HAVE A RIFLE HOUSING NEEDS WE LIKE TO MEET WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH CENTER HERTZBERG ON THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE- TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION. IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. THING NINE A MOVING TO THE TELE. LINE MR MADHUR IF YOU Q. WITNESSES WANT TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION WHO- SB. FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN ONE FIVE EIGHT ZERO FOR OPPOSITION TO SB. FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN. NOBODY IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME VERY VERY GOOD WILL BRING THIS BILL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR WIENER I THANK YOU MANAGEMENT SURE I'D- SUPPORTED THIS BILL AND- HOUSING COMMITTEE WITH AMENDMENTS AND ALL SUPPORTED AGAIN TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL- I YOU KNOW OUR TIME WILL BE CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS- WITH THE HAUSER'S- I WILL SAY I DON'T- FIVE. YOU KNOW I HAVE NO. I DON'T OBJECT TO MIDDLE INCOME FOCUSED- HOUSING PROGRAMS LIKE THIS- YOU KNOW IS. UNITING THE OPPOSITION POINT IS- IS VALID AND THAT WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND GREAT NEEDS OF VARIOUS INCOME LEVELS THAT'S ALWAYS THE- THE TOUGH PART OF IT AND- YOU KNOW IT'S AND I'M NOT SEEN AS A RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER IT'S JUST REALLY. REALLY HARD BECAUSE THIS SOCIETY IS REALLY D. PRIORITIZE THE PRIORITIZED. HOUSING SUBSIDIES WE USED TO BUILD ALL SORTS OF PUBLIC HOUSING MASSIVE INVESTMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT YOU KNOW ENDED FORTY YEARS AGO- AND WE'VE BEEN PICKING UP THE PIECES EVER SINCE SO I HOPE WE ARE AT ONE POINT ACTUALLY GOT. MASSIVE FEDERAL INVESTMENT HOUSING LIKE WE USED TO HAVE- PASSAGE WANTED TO DO ONE SAYS I ALIVE SUPPORT HOMEOWNERSHIP- PROGRAMS- RENTING IS ALSO IMPORTANT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY FOR YOU KNOW OUR LOWEST INCOME RESIDENTS IT'S PER THERE ARE. PEOPLE WHO IT'S NOT. REALISTIC AT LEAST AT NUMBER PRESENT WAY FOR THEM TO OWN. BUT BUT RENTAL ACTUALLY I DIDN'T DOES PLAY. US IMPORTANT ROLE IN AN EFFICIENT HOUSING MARKET THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT YOU'RE NOT IN A POSITION THE OWNER AT THAT MAKES NO SENSE FOR THEM. TO OWN- RENTING HAVING THAT NOT IS THE ONLY THING HOMEOWNERSHIP IS VERY. IMPORTANT RENTING IS VERY IMPORTANT. A TERMS OF- MOBILIT FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO RELOCATE TO DIFFERENT PLACES MEMBER THE NOT READY TO SETTLE DOWN- THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST NOT A PLACE TO LIVE WHERE THEY WANT TO MAKE THAT LONG TERM COMMITMENTS ARE PEOPLE NEED THE FLEXIBILITY. TWO METERS AROUND OUR OWN. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS NOW. I'M SO SORRY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS NOW IS THAT BECAUSE OF A MASSIVE HOUSING SHORTAGE WE ARE NOT GIVING PEOPLE THE OPTION TO OWN BECAUSE IT'S TOO IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE SO THEY ARE RENTERS WHO WANT TO OWN. WE SHOULD GIVE THEM THAT ABILITY. WELL RECOGNIZING THAT RENTING IS STILL VERY IMPORTANT THANK YOU FOR THE WATER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER COMMENTS. CENTER DRIVE YEAH- I KNOW THE- AUTHORS EVEN EXPRESSED RIGHT BUT THE GOAL IS. WE GOT TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO GET. A GENERATIONAL WEALTH- SO AND I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IN THAT- SIMILAR TO WHAT- CENTER WIENER SAID. HOW DO WE HOW DOES THIS HELP. THE ISSUE OF SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO. TAKE EVEN THAT LOAN RIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT LOAN TO THEM HOW DOES THIS HELP. THE ENORMOUS CRISIS OF PEOPLE WHO CAN BARELY HOLD ON- THEY WOULD DREAM OF THE DAY THAT THEY COULD BE ABLE TO PAY IT BACK SO I IT. IT SOME IT'S AN IMPORTANT I SEE IT IS IMPORTANT PIECE BUT WITH WHAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT WELL IT IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT CON LIKE WE DO IN RENTAL HOUSING IF SOMEONE SAY COMES IN DEVELOPER. HAS HAS A HUNDRED UNITS WE COULD DO IS SET ASIDE FOR MORE AFFORDABLE PEOPLE AND BASICALLY THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE GONNA KILL HIGHER PRICE TO GET THERE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT WE CAN'T SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE'VE GOTTEN REASON RENTS ARE GOING UP SO HIGH AS WE HAVE A SUPPLY AND DEMAND PROBLEM SO HOW DO WE- INCREASE AND INCENTIVIZE THE- SUPPLY SIDE RIGHT HOW DO WE INCREASE PRODUCTION ALL THE NUMBERS TALKING ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MILLION THREE HAVE ME WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS. OF WHAT WE NEED IN THAT DEFICIT THAT'S CAUSING RISING COSTS FOR EVERYBODY SO LOOK CLEARLY I THINK WHAT SENATOR WINNERS IT'S CORRECT I OVERSTATE MY CASE. WHICH IS FINE TERMS ARE BETTER BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY I WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WEALTH I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR SOCIETY OF PEOPLE BUILD WEALTH THERE ARE NEEDS OTHERWISE BUT TO THE EXTENT FOLKS ARE ARE POOR AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO. GET SOMETHING AND BUILD WEALTH WE GOT TO MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK SO NO IT DOESN'T SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IN MY THINKING IS THA INSTEAD OF THE TAX DOLLARS PAYING FOR EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME TO SO MANY DEMANDS WE'VE GOT TO BALANCE IT OUT. WE'VE GOT TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A LEG UP FOR PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME WEGOT TO PROVIDE THE SAFETY NET ALL THE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE ALONG THE CONTINUUM I'M NOT TRYING TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS. I'M TRYING TO SOLVE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AND I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT THIS COLLATERAL BENEFITS BRIEFLY IN THIS IF YOU HAVE HAVING A BUNCH MORE HOUSING COSTS WHAT YOU INCREASE PROPERTY TAX INCREASE THE PROPERTY TAX INCREASE MONEY. TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR SO SAFETY THAT ISSUES YOU CREATE JOBS WHICH THEN CREATE. CONSTRUCTION JOBS 74% ECONOMIC FEEDBACK AFFECT HUGE IMPACTS THE HELP BRIDES EVERYBODY ALONG THE PROCESS SO. YOU GOTTA BUILD THE MONEY YOU GOTTA MAKE WORK DOM KLAY. AND YOU'RE RIGHT. SOLVE ALL THOSE THOSE ARE. BUT I THINK IT A LOT OF OTHER BENEFITS AND- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A TEN GAUGE THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF FINANCE. AND HIS TEAM AND WE'LL GET BACK TO PUT OUT A REPORT THAT TALKS ABOUT.

OUR LAST THE BILL TODAY IS THE CHAIRS BILL. HE WILL PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY. ARE YOU READY TO GO I DON'T CARE I AM READY. PLEASE PROCEED ON YOUR LEGISLATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB FOURTEEN FORTY NINE THE UNINCORPORATED AREA ANNEXATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN THIS BILL ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE FOUR OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WHAT THE STATE THERE ARE MANY URBANIZED INHABITED AREAS IN THE COUNTY AND INCORPORATED AREAS THAT ARE SURROUNDED BY INCORPORATED CITY RESIDENTS. THESE AN INCORPORATED AREAS HAVE NO LOCAL REPRESENTATION BUT INSTEAD ARE GOVERNED BY THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THESE AREAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTED THIS ADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES THE LEVEL OF BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES IS MINIMAL IF IT EXISTS AT ALL. TO ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR THIS BILL I ASK YOU TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE SHOES OF SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN A POOR RURAL AN INCORPORATED AREA. IMAGINE A PARENT WALKING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL ONE DAY AFTER A HEAVY NIGHT OF RAIN. BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY LACKS PROPER SIDEWALKS AND STORM DRAINAGE THE FAMILY IS FORCED TO WALK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD IN ORDER TO AVOID FLOODED- MANY AREAS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE TYPICALLY SERVE AS PEDESTRIAN PATHS. THIS IS THE REALITY FOR MANY PEOPLE LIVING IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS AT NIGHT I'VE SEEN IT I'VE BEEN IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS- AFTER A RAINY DAY AND- I WAS SHOCKED. TO SEE PARENTS WALKING THEIR CHILDREN DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. BECAUSE HE'S COMMUNITIES DO NOT HAVE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE SERVICES THEY MUST MAKE DO WITH WHAT LITTLE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LEVEL OF SERVICE PROVIDED WITHIN A CITY VERSES WITHIN AN UNINCORPORATED AREA IS EVEN MORE NOTICEABLE IN THE AREA HAPPENS TO BE FULLY SURROUNDED BY CITIES BOUNDARIES. CREATING AN UNINCORPORATED ISLAND. IN MANY CASES LEADING RIGHT UP TO THE BOUNDARIES OF THE ISLAND THERE WILL BE PAVED ROADS SIDEWALKS CURBS GUTTERS AND STREET LIGHTS ONLY TO STOP. IMMEDIATELY UPON ENTERING THE BOUNDARIES AT THE END INCORPORATED HIGHLAND. AND TO CONTINUE ON AGAIN WITH CITY SERVICES AFTER EXITING THAT THAT ISLAND. WELL EXISTING LAW PREVENTS THE CITY FROM LEAPFROGGING OVER AN INCORPORATED AREAS WHEN EXPANDING THEIR BORDERS TODAY. THE INCORPORATED ISLANDS CREATED FROM YEARS OF CITIES PICKING AND CHOOSING WHICH AREAS THEY WISH TO ANNEX REMAINS. THIS IN PART IS DUE TO THE COST TO BUILD AND CONNECT THE COMMUNITY THE CITY INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH CREATED A DISINCENTIVE FOR SISTER CITIES TO PURSUE ANNEXATION. THAT'S WHY I'VE INTRODUCED SB FOURTEEN FORTY NINE THIS YEAR TO ENCOURAGE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO JOINTLY PURSUE ANNEXATIONS OF THESE UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND PROVIDE THE BASIC NEEDS THAT MOST PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANTED. AS A WAY TO ELIMINATE THESE ISLANDS SPECIFICALLY SB FOURTEEN FORTY- WELL AT FOURTEEN FORTY NINE WILL CREATE A NEW GRANT PROGRAM WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE THROUGH A MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES- WHO ANNEX UNINCORPORATED AREAS FOR PURPOSES OF FUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS RELATED TO HEALTH AND SAFETY. SUCH AS SEWER SERVICE SIDEWALKS CURBS STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS WITH AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY AND COMMITTEE OPR WILL BE REQUIRED TO PRIORITIZE GRANTS FOR ANNEXATION OF DISADVANTAGED UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES AND A WORK WITH SPECIFIC STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND THE LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM. HERE WITH ME AND COMMITTEE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS CHRISLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. MR LEE PLEASE CONFIRM. GOOD AFTERNOON BY STERN NIELSEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES HERE TODAY IN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT- I KNOW WE'VE HAD A LONG HEARING SO I'LL TRY TO LIMIT MY ENTHUSIASM AND KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT I DO REALLY LIKE THIS BILL AND ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE IT SO MUCH AS I THINK BACK TO MY TIME IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WORKING WITH THE COUNTY WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM PROGRAM LIKE THIS I THINK ABOUT A MOBILE HOME PARK SURROUNDED ON THREE SIDES BY A CITY AND ON ONE SIDE BY ACTUALLY THE NEIGHBORING COUNTY HUGE PROBLEMS WITH SERVICES EVEN JUST GETTING THE SHERIFF TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE OF THE PHYSICAL ISOLATION I THINK AOUT A COMMUNITY THAT'S LOCATED JUST ACROSS THE STREET FROM A CITY BUT DOESN'T HAVE WATER AND SEWER SERVICE. EXCEPT FOR VERY LIMITED AND- SUBSTANDARD SYSTEM THESE ARE THE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES IN THE TYPES OF DISPARITIES THAT SB FOURTEEN FORTY NINE WILL HELP TO REMEDY AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHY DO WE HAVE SOME OF THESE DISCREPANCIES SO MANY OF THESE AREAS MAY HAVE BEEN BUILT BEFORE TODAY'S MODERN STANDARDS FOR IMPROVEMENTS THEY MIGHT OF USE LOOPHOLES LIKE FOR BY BORING OR A PARCEL MAP OR I'D ANTIQUATED SUBDIVISION TO GET AROUND. THE BUILT BUILDING ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF PRODUCING THOSE SIDEWALKS AND OTHER OFFSITE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE OFTEN NEEDED A LOT OF THE INCORPORATORS AREAS LACK THE TAX BASE THEY GET A SMALL SHARE OF THE PROPERTY TAX THE AREAS THAT HAVE A LOT OF SALES TAX ARE USUALLY THE FIRST ONES TO GET ANNEXED AND SO WHERE YOU TYPICALLY SEE A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE IN THE UNINCORPORATED ZONE IS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE VOTED TO TAX THEMSELVES ARE. FORMER SPECIAL DISTRICT TO PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT THEY'RE REALLY COMPETING AGAINST EVERY OTHER USE OF GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THAT COULD BE HAPPENING AT THE COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PUBLIC SAFETY ETCETERA. SO REALLY SMETIMES THE BEST OPTION FOR THESE COMMUNITIES IS ANNEXATION INTO THE CITY BUT WHY ISN'T THAT HAPPENING SOONER CABALLERO DIGNIFIED ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES WHICH IS THE COST OF BRINGING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE UP TO THE SAME LEVEL AS THE CITY'S. GOING AN EXAMPLE FOR STANNIS COUNTY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND. DOLLARS PER MILE OF SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS AND CITIES AND COUNTIES ALREADY FACE HUGE DEFICITS FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE THIRTY SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN UNFUNDED NEEDS TO MAINTAIN OUR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. AND TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMPLETE STREETS COMPONENTS LIKE SIDEWALKS DRAINAGE IN EXACTLY THE TYPES OF THEM STRUCTURE SB FOURTEEN FORTY NINE WITH SUPPORT WORK WITH THE AUTHORED MAKE SURE THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE IN SOME OF THE SPECIFICS OF THE BILL GET THIS RIGHT BECAUSE THAT. THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE IT REALLY WORKS IN PRACTICE BUT HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER. HERE PRESENT THE TESTIFY SIR THANKS EVEN ACROSS THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. LEAGUE OF CITIES YOU SAID. YES SIR OKAY THANK YOU. MANY OTHERS. A AND- DO WE HAVE ANY- ON ON THE LINE. MODERATOR THANK YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT FOR S. B. FOURTEEN FORTY NINE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR NOBODY IS KILLING OUT ALL RIGHT. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OPPOSITION BUT WHY DON'T YOU INQUIRE OPERATOR WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY BUT- WOULD YOU INQUIRE. AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY AT THIS TIME INTO OPPOSITION R. FOR OPPOSITION. ON S. B. FOURTEEN FORTY NINE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. ONE ZERO. SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE NONE A MEDICARE WOULD GOING UP WITH PART PARDON. I AYE SKEWS ME I WAS JUST SAYING NOBODY IS KILLING US THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED THE MAN CARE DO WANT TO WISH TO DO GOOD VEHICLES FOR SENATE BECAUSE THE CENTER WE ARE NOT EXCUSE ME NO PROBLEM- FIVE FOR SO I MOVED THE BILL- I MEAN THIS IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA GIVING- COUNTIES ARTISTICALLY GIVING CITIES MORE TOOLS AND RESOURCES. AND INCENTIVES TO OUR CORPORATION OUR TO AN EXCUSE ME- OF COURSE ANNEXATION IS ALWAYS- COMPLICATED AND THERE THE SITUATIONS THAT YOU DESCRIBED WITH HER VERY VERY REAL- THERE ARE OTHER- MORE POLITICIZED ASPECTS OF MY- I NEVER HAD TO- YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANNEXATION- BEING IN A CITY IN A COUNTY THAT WAS COMBINED BUT- ONES. I WAS ELECTED TO THE SENATE THANK YOU REPRESENT UNINCORPORATED AREA AND A CEMETERY COUNTY- BROUGHT MORE WHICH IS IF YOU LOOK AT A MAP IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S PART OF DALY CITY BUT IT'S NOT AND THERE'S BEEN THE RECESSION LEGISLATION DECADES AGO BY- THEM CENTER CLINT COP TO BAN DALY CITY FROM ANNEXING. BROADMOOR DALY CITY AS A TIMES AND NEXT BECOME THE LUCRATIVE TAX BASS COMMERCIAL AREAS ABROAD MORE BUT DOESN'T WANT THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND BROADMOOR HAS ITS OWN POLICE COMMISSION THEIR SYSTEMS SELVES ARE PENSION LIABILITIES USE IS ALWAYS VERY COMPLICATED BUT OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ENCOURAGE- ANNEXATION THE SUPPORT OF SOME HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. AND THE QUESTION ALSO- THANK YOU SENATOR- IT IS STILL WITH. THIS TO ENCOURAGE I JUST WANT TO CLEAR THAT THE GRANT. DOESN'T READ THEM TO. THE B. M. BUT THAT IS- IT'S WHILE IT CONSIDERED REQUIRING IT BECAUSE MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE HAVE REALLY BEEN ABANDONED TO THEIR OWN DEVICES THERE ON SEPT SIX WHEN THEY'RE SEWER RIGHT DOWN AT THE END OF THE STREET- THEY SOME OF THEM ARE ON WELLS STILL WHEN THEY COULD HOOK INTO THE WATER SYSTEM AND- NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR WELLS- AND THEN THERE'S THE CURB GUTTER SIDEWALK THE DRAINAGE ISSUES- THIS. IS VOLUNTARY- THIS WILL CREATE. THE REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE NEIGHBORS TO UNITE AND TO GO TO THE CITY AND THE COUNTY AND TO SAY WE WANT THIS I'VE MET WITH A NUMBER OF NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND THIS IS THEIR NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS THAT. WE HAVE REALLY BAD SERVICE THIS THE SHERIFF IS RARELY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT IN THE- IN THE HINTERLANDS- AND WHEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE CALL CITY POLICE. WHEN THEY MOVE INTO THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THEY DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A COUNTY INCORPORATED BECAUSE IT LOOKS THE SAME AND AT NIGHT. IF YOU DRIVE ITO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S PITCH DARK AND YOU CAN SEE THREE BLOCKS DOWN THE ROAD YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHTS. STARTING AND A BLOCK THIS WAY AND SEE THE LIGHTS AND SO THEY'RE REALLY- LEFT- YOU END UP WITH BURNED OUT HOUSES- A LOT OF TRASH BEING ACCUMULATING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE THERE'S NO LIGHTS THERE'S NO ACTIVITY- TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE SO THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT IS SO THIS IS- TO ALLOW THEM TO. APPLY FOR THE GRANTS TO. DO THE THINGS THAT. SHOULD BE DONE THAT'S CORRECT BUT ULTIMATELY. THEY THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE AND I GUESS THE IDEA IS THAT IT'S AN INCENTIVE THIS IS THE CARROT BEFORE WE GO IN WITH A STICK. SO MANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO COMMENT. AND WE HAVE A MOTION THE NEW WANNA GIVE A CLOSURE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS OKAY. WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SIR.
