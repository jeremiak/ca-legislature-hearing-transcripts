THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING A DUE TO OUR CONTINUED STAY AT HOME ORDER WERE PRACTICING PHYSICAL DISTANCING HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM AND THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL BUILDING SO WE'RE ONLY ALLOWING A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM- PARTICIPATING IN PERSON MOST OF THEM WILL BE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. WE'RE ALSO REQUIRING THAT MASS BE WARNED AND PHYSICALLY PHYSICAL DISTANCING MAY BE MAINTAINED BY ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TESTIFYING WEATHER HERE IN THE ROOM WARRANTED THE VIDEO CONFERENCING SITE. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MASK WE WILL PROVIDE ONE. TO YOU. AND BECAUSE- LET'S SEE. SO WE HAVE A FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION FOR ANYONE WHO'S WATCHING OR LISTENING. FOR THE PUBLIC THAT'S IN THE ROOM. WHEN WE REACH THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF THE AGENDA I'M GOING TO ASK THAT ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE ROOM APPROACH THE MIKE ONLY ONE PERSON AT A TIME. MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE SOCIAL DISTANCING AS YOU MOVE AROUND THE ROOM. AND I WILL ASK THAT YOU NOT TOUCH THE MICROPHONE. YOU CAN EXIT THE HEARING ROOM ONCE YOU'RE DONE PROVIDING YOUR COMMENTS OR YOU CAN RETURN TO YOUR SEAT. AND AS YOU'RE LEAVING THE CAPITAL ALSO PLEASE MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING ARE ONLY ALLOWING ONE PERSON IN THE ELEVATOR AT A TIME. FOR THOSE WHO ARE- VIDEO CONFERENCING WHO ARE AT OUR VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM OR REMOTE TESTIFYING STATIONS FOR THE WITNESSES- WE- LET'S SEE. YOU WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE YOU IF YOUR VIDEO TESTIFYING IF YOU ARE ON THE TELEPHONE WE WILL HEAR YOU WILL TAKE TESTIMONY FROM ALL THE WITNESSES ON EACH PANEL- AND THEN WE WILL ASK QUESTIONS AT THE END OF EACH PANEL SO FOR THE WITNESSES IF YOU COULD STAND BY SO THAT WE CAN ASK ME QUESTIONS OR LET US KNOW IN ADVANCE IF YOU CAN'T. WAIT TO TELL THEM. AND THEN FOR DIAL IN WITNESSES. WE'RE GOING TO BE USING A MODERATED TELEPHONE SERVICE FOR YOU AND FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. THE CALL IN NUMBER FOR THIS HEARING IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN THAT'S. 877-692-8950 SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. FIFTEEN. YOU CAN ALSO FIND THIS NUMBERON THE ASSEMBLY WEBSITE AND ON YOUR SCREEN IF YOU'RE WATCHING US. THE OPERATOR ON THE LINE WILL GIVE YOU INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO BE PLACED IN THE QUEUE TO PROVIDER PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU'RE CALLING AND YOU HAVE TO ELIMINATE ALL BACKGROUND NOISE AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU MUTE THE LIVE STREAM BROADCAST AND YOUR SMART DEVICE OTHERWISE IT WILL ECHO AND WILL WILL HAVE TO DISCONNECT YOU. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED TO LIMIT HOW LONG EACH PERSON HAS TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. AS WE NEED TO EXIT THE HEARING ROOM IN TIME FOR CLEANING UP PRIOR TO THE NEXT HEARING. SO CALL IN A TESTIMONY AND IN PERSON TESTIMONY WILL BE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES APIECE. SO WITH THAT SAID LET'S TURN TO THE HEARING. NOW WE ALL ARE AWARE OF PLASTIC POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS REALLY CAPTURED THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION THOSE OF US WITH CHILDREN KNOW THAT THEY ARE BEING TAUGHT ABOUT PLASTIC POLLUTION IN SCHOOL WE'VE ALL SEEN I HOPE WE'VE ALL SEEN THE REALLY SAD AND SHOCKING VIDEOS OF THE IMPACT OF PLASTIC POLLUTION ON WILDLIFE. WITH BOTH BIRDS AND MARINE WILDLIFE I'M DYING BECAUSE OF THE PLASTIC POLLUTION WHICH IS NOW COMING CLOSE TO OVERTAKING THE AMOUNT OF FISH THAT ARE IN THE OCEAN. I ANYBODY WHO DIES OR SWIM SEES THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC POLLUTION WHICH SOMETIMES IS INVISIBLE BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO SEE IN THE WATER BUT IT'S THERE AND IT WASHES P ON SHORE AND IT'S REALLY A HORRIBLE THING THAT WE'RE DOING TO OUR PLANET IN THAT WE'RE LEAVING OUR CHILDREN BEHIND- UNFORTUNATELY. THE MATERIAL THAT SHIPPED INTO OUR STATE- FROM OUT OF STATE A LOT OF TIMES- IT REALLY IS LEFT UP TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO DEAL WITH THE IMPACTS BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY AND ALSO FINANCIALLY. LAST MONTH I ATTENDED A TORN OREGON WASHINGTON TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR RECYCLING SYSTEMS. AFTER MEETING WITH EXPERTS IN BOTH STATES IT'S CLEAR THAT WE SHARE A LOT OF THE SAME CHALLENGES ON THE WEST COAST. ARE WE ALL HAVE NO REAL WAY OF MANAGING THE PROLIFERATION OF PLASTIC AND THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S AFFECTING EVERYBODY PARTICULARLY COASTAL STATES. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS SENATOR BEN ALLEN ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLYWOMAN LORENA GONZALEZ ALONG WITH MYSELF AND MANY OTHER JOINT AUTHORS AND CO AUTHORS WORKED TO PASS SB FIFTY FOUR IN AB TEN EIGHTY. BILLS THAT WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND PLASTIC POLLUTION REDUCTION ACT. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL DID NOT PASS THE FLOOR AND PLASTIC CONTINUES TO POSE A THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WITH NO SOLUTIONS. ON THE CURRENT HORIZON. TODAY'S JOINT HEARING IS INTENDED TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE IMPROVE THE IMPACTS OF PLASTIC ON THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT. MOST OF US ARE AWARE AS I SAID ON THE IMPACT ON MARINE ENVIRONMENT BUT THE IMPACTS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION EXTEND TO THE ERROR WE BLEW IT BRIEFED. THE WATER WE DRINK THE FOOD WE EAT. THE CONTENT OF OUR OF OUR BLOOD AT THIS POINT- HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY PLASTICS. AS WELL AS OUR HEALTH AND THESE IMPACTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT OUR WHAT'S CALLED OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES THESE ARE MANY TIMES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES MANY TIMES MINORITY. COMMUNITIES AND THEY BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE BRUNT OF THE IMPACTS OF POLLUTION AND PLASTIC POLLUTION. I'D LIKE TO THANK MR MCCARTY FIRST PARTICIPATION AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. AND OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE FOR JOINING US TODAY. MR MCCARTY WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING STATEMENTS I THINK YOU JUST OUT BRIEFLY SO CERTAINLY I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE BUT ALSO AS YOU SAID. CHAIR THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON WASTE REDUCTION RECYCLING IN THE ISSUE OF PLASTICS IN OUR SOCIETY IS ONE THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT FROM FOR MANY ASPECTS- AS YOU SAID. CERTAINLY IF YOU TALK TO ANY SCHOOL KID TODAY AND KIND PROJECT THEY DO IN THEIR SCIENCE CLASS IT'S USUALLY ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF. PLASTIC ON OUR RIVERS AND OCEAN AND IMPACT ON WILDLIFE BUT THERE ARE ISSUES TO. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN OUR CITIES IN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND TAXPAYERS AS WELL SO I KNOW THAT THIS HEARINGS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THE IMPACTS THAT. THE REALISTIC HEALTH IMPACTS TO SOCIETY BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE MANAGEMENT ISUES. AND AS YOU SAID- THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT YEARS AGO OUT PLASTICS NOT JUST IN THE STREETS IN OUR CREEKS BUT- ENDS UP IN OUR BLOOD SYSTEM. AND THESE MICROPLASTICS REALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON ON THE ON THE HUMAN BODY WHICH WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES WELL SUCK LOOK FOR TODAY'S HEARING NOT JUST THE THAT REALITY BUT ALSO STEPS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO. TO MITIGATE THESE ISSUES SO LET'S BEGIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU O. M. ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS ON THE PHONE WHO WANT TO MAKE ANY OPENING STATEMENTS. OR- VIDEO CONFERENCING. I KNOW WE HAVE MR AL MURATSUCHI ON THE PHONE WITH US. SO I WOULD JUST ASK IF HE IS INTERESTED TO REACH OUT FOR THE SERGEANTS. OKAY NOT HEARING ANY WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO OUR FIRST PANEL ON THE IMPACTS OF PLASTIC. THIS ON THIS PANEL WHICH HAS BEEN JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY OPENINGS. OKAY OUR FIRST PANEL CONSISTS OF- ANDREA LEON GROSSMANN WITH THE LOS ANGELES REMOTE IF WITH- AS ALL- CHELSEA ROCHMAN PROFESSOR WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO AND TERRA BROKE WITH OCEANIA. HI WE HAVE OUR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. FIRST WITNESS. HELLO I SEE SOMEBODY THERE WE GO. HI WE CAN SEE YOU CAN YOU HEAR US I WOULD. OKAY OKAY YES CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAMP WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. OKAY HI MY NAME IS ANDREA GROSSMAN AND I AM THE CLIMATE ACTION DIRECTOR WITH A SCHOOL. TODAY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE MY POWER POINT PRESENTATION. LET US LET US GET FED UP ON THE SCREEN IT ONE MOMENT IS SET UP ON THE SCREEN. ONE MOMENT THANK YOU. I AM VERY SORRY- IF YOU COULD BE PATIENT WITH US PLEASE WE SKIPPED OUR FIRST OPENING WITNESS WE HAVE AN OVERVIEW FROM ROSS FROM WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO HIM FIRST AND THEN COME RIGHT BACK TO YOU. THANKS. HELLO GET READY FOR ME. YES WE CAN WELCOME OKAY- SO I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROSS BROWN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO JUST PROVIDE THE VERY BRIEF PRESENTATION TO KICK THINGS OFF WITH SOME JUST BACKGROUND INFORMATION TO SET THE STAGE IN THE CONTEXT FOR THE REST OF THE HEARING- YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED HOPEFULLY- HANDOUT THAT WE PUT TOGETHER THAT'S TITLED OVERVIEW OF PLASTICS AND CALIFORNIA- AND I'M JUST GONNA BE WALKING THROUGH SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN THAT HAND OUT. FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO MAY NOT HAVE A COPY OF THAT- THAT HAND OUT IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE IT'S ALEJO DOT CA DOT GOV AND IT SHOULD BE POSTED ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THAT WEBSITE FOR PEOPLE TO FOLLOW ALONG. I SO GONNA DIE RIGHT INTO IT PAGE. OF THE HANDOUTS. ARE REALLY JUST SUMMARIZE A SOME OF THE MAJOR GOALS AND POLICIES OF THE STATE IS ENACTED- BUT BOTH SORT OF BROAD- WASTE GOALS AS WELL AS GOALS ARE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO PLASTICS- AS YOU ALL KNOW THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM FOCUSES ON ALL. A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF- BEVERAGE CONTAINERS INCLUDING. PLASTIC CONTAINERS- THERE'S A STATEWIDE RECYCLING GOAL WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN TWENTY ELEVEN. THAT ESTABLISHES A GOAL OF 75% SOURCE REDUCTION RECYCLING COMPOSTING BY TWENTY TWENTY AND I'LL GET BACK TO THAT IN JUST ONE MOMENT- THE SINGLE USE PLASTIC BAG BAN WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN LIKE THIS LEGISLATION AND THEN. APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- AND I'M I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE JUST TO KIND OF TOUCH ON A FEW OF THEM IN THE FINAL LINE OF COURSE- THIS PAST YEAR MANDATORY RECYCLING CONTENTS AND PLASTIC BOTTLES. I WHICH REQUIRES THAT PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS CONSIST OF A MINIMUM OF. 50% RECYCLED CONTENT BY TWENTY THIRTY SO THAT'S JUST KIND OF TO SET THE STAGE A BIT ON SOME OF THE STATE POLICIES- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OTHER HAND OUT I'M GONNA. JUMP INTO JUST A FEW DIFFERENT PIECES OF DATA AND INFORMATION- I KIND OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE STATE OF WISDOM. AND PLASTICS IN CALIFORNIA VERY HIGH LEVEL SO. PAGE TWO SHOWS A CHART OF- THIS IS ANNUAL LANDFILLED WASTE IN TERMS OF BILLIONS OF TIMES. OVER THE LAST- TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT- THAT AMOUNT WAS DECREASING UNTIL- SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER THE LAST. SEVERAL YEARS AND I DO WANT TO NOTE THIS IS NOT JUST PLASTICS THIS S OVERALL. A LANDFILLED WASTE- AND THE ESTIMATED RECYCLING RATE WHICH I MENTIONED BEFORE WHERE THE STATE HAS A GOAL OF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT- WAS 40% ANDTWENTY EIGHTEEN SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A- A SENSE OF CONTEXT OF WHERE WE ARE. AND THAT GOAL- AND SO BEFORE I MOVE ON TO SOME SOME OF THE REMAINING CHARTS WHICH FOCUS A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICALLY. ON PLASTICS I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT. AS REPORTING THE PRESENTE TOGETHER WITH THAT KIND OF REALIZED THAT YOU KNOW THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH DEPARTMENT THAT'S- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THERE'S NOT. GREAT OF FULLER. OF ALL OF THE PLASTIC THAT COMES INTO THE STATE ON EXACTLY WHERE ALL THAT. PLASTIC ENDS UP WHETHER IT BE LANDFILLS OR WHETHER IT'S EXPORTED- OR RECYCLED DOMESTICALLY WITHOUT YOUR PIECES OF INFORMATION ON THAT WE'RE GONNA. TRY TO HIT ON SOME OF THOSE KEY PIECES OF INFORMATION BUT- I'M JUST NOT KIND OF A FULL ACCOUNTING OF. ALL THE PLASTIC AND EXACTLY WHERE IT GOES- IT WAS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT OR SCROLL TO PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT- THIS IS JUST A PICTURE OF THE KIND OF THE OVERALL AMOUNTS OF WASTE THAT. I WENT INTO LANDFILLS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT WEBSITE THAT CHART GIVES YOU SORT OF THE PROPORTION IT'S PLASTIC TO ABOUT 12% OF. OVER ALWAYS THAT WENT INTO LANDFILLS WAS PLASTIC. THAT'S ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION TONS- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A THAT THIS INCLUDES A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTIC- MATERIALS FROM. TWO CONTAINERS TO TRASH BAGS TO BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND SOME CASES. TOYS AND FURNITURE- AND THEN IN TERMS OF HOW THIS HAS CHANGED OVER TIME- THE OVERALL PERCENT GOING INTO LANDFILLS. HAS GROWN FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AT NINE POINT 6% TO ELEVEN POINT 5% TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THAT IS. HAS GONE UP OF THE LAST DECADE OR SO. IF YOU. TO NOW TO PAGE. FOUR OF THE HAND- THIS IS DUE JUST A- OF A BIT OF A PICTURE OF. THE MAIN PLASTIC BOTTLES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM SO THIS IS JUST BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND- ONES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE STATE'S BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM- THEY RATE OF RECYCLING OF THOSE CONTAINERS. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART HAS REMAINED. RELATIVELY STEADY. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT- HOWEVER I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT- BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM PLASTIC ONES. ARE REALLY ONLY MAKE UP A VERY SMALL SHARE OF THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF PLASTIC. AND THE STATE AND THESE ARE THE TYPES OF- CONTAINERS THAT- ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO BE RECYCLED- BUT THEY ARE VERY SMALL SHARE OF KIND OF OVERALL PLASTIC IN THE STATE. ESTIMATED ABOUT TWO TO THREE PERCENT. OF OVERALL PLASTIC- AND THE IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL VOLUME AMOUNT OF CONTAINERS- ALTHOUGH THE RECYCLING RATE AS MAY REMAIN RELATIVELY STEADY- THE OVERALL VOLUME HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE TWENTY TEN SO. FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION- OF THESE PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND TWENTY TEN HAS GROWN TO. ABOUT NINE POINT TWO BILLION. OTHERS A MINOR TYPO AND THEIR RECENT MILLION BUT IT'S- NINE POINT TWO BILLION. AND TWENTY NINETEEN JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE FOR- THE SCALE THERE. AND THEN FINALLY- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR- OF THE HANDOUT OR SCROLL TO PAGE FIVE- HERE'S SOME INFORMATION ON- ON PLASTIC EXPORTS. IN RECENT YEARS- HISTORICALLY MOST RECYCLABLE PLASTIC HAS BEEN EXPORTED TO OTHER COUNTRIES- IT'S THROUGH CITRIX WORKS- AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART HERE- THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT OF PLASTICS OF RIGHT IT DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTICS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPORTED- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- EXPORT. OF PLASTIC SAYS DECLINES DUE TO INCREASED REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL IMPORTS OF PLASTIC WASTE AS I'M SURE. MOST OR ALL OF YOUR FAMILIAR WITH CHINA'S NATIONAL SWORD POLICY IS ONE OF THE- ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT I WHICH IS KIND OF RESTRICTED THE AMOUNT OF PLASTICS- THAT BUT CAN BE EXPORTED. AND THERE ARE SOME THE LAST BUT WE KNOW THERE IS THERE ARE SOME NEW GLOBAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PLAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH COULD. EVEN FURTHER REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC. THAT CAN BE EXPORTED- WITH THE INTENT OF BEING RECYCLED- SO GETTING BACK TO KIND OF UR EARLIER POINT. YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT THE- AMOUNT OF PLASTICS EXPORTED HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BUT- WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY- AT LEAST ON THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN AS EXACTLY. WHERE ALL OF THAT PLASTIC HAS GONE SOME OF THAT pDOMESTICALLY POTENTIALLY. I SUMMIT COULD END UP IN LANDFILLS COULD END UP IN OTHER PLACES SO THAT'S I THINK ONE OF THE- AN EXAMPLE OF KIND OF THAT DATA GAP ON INFORMATION THAT WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT AND A LOT OF THIS PLAN IT SEEMS. IS EXACTLY. WHERE THAT- PLASTIC IT'S GOING. NOW SO- I WILL IN MY COMMENTS THERE AND OF COURSE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WILL FIRST TASK GIVEN OF THE MEMBERS OF THE- HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NO I HAVE NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. A FOR YOUR OVERVIEW IT GIVES US A VERY GOOD- I THINK APPRECIATION FOR THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND ALSO. A CERTAINLY IN THE TREND THAT WE'RE HAVING IN TERMS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION AND LANDFILL IMPACTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY AND NOW WE WILL MOVE TO OUR FIRST PANEL. SO IF WE COULD PLEASE HAVE MISS LEON GROSSMANN BACK. ON THE SCREEN AND- HI THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR POWER POINT IT. IS ON THE SCREEN AS WELL SO YOU CAN BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. SO AGAIN MY NAME IS ANDREA LEON GROSSMANN- THE CLIMATE ACTION DIRECTOR WITH US ALL. I'M HERE TODAY. TO PRESENT A PLASTIC IN CALIFORNIA AND THE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND ENVIRONMENT AND THANK YOU FOR. HAVING ME TODAY. AT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I'M PLASTIC IS AN INVENTOR ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE OUR MEMBERS OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE ILLNESSES RELATED TO AN EXTRACTIVE ECONOMY INCLUDING ASTRA HIGH RISK PREGNANCIES AND CANCER. I TOOK THIS PICTURE A COUPLE YEARS BACK IN WILMINGTON THEY HAVE SIX REFINERIES AND IF YOU CAN SEE MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. NEXT LIFELESS. OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN A HALF MILE OFTEN OIL WELL IN L. A. COUNTY. OTHERS ALSO OVER FIVE THOUSAND ACTIVE OIL WELLS. AND THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT OF THE COUCH AND MAP FOR LA AND YOU CAN SEE ALL THE OIL WELLS THAT WE HAVE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS IS THE SAME MAP FOR THE CALIBERS SCREEN. ONE OF THE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS LEAVING WITH- POLLUTION- AROUND LIVE AROUND HERE IN 92% OF THEM ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. LIFELIKE PLEASE. SO THIS IS AN OVERLAY OF THE OIL EXTRACTION AND THE CALIBER SCREEN AND YOU CAN SEE DEFINITELY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. NEIGHBORHOOD DRILLING IS ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SOME GONNA TAKE YOU THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE OF PLASTICS OR LIKE I CALL IT THAT THAT CYCLE OF CLASSICS SO IT ALL STARTS WITH EXTRACTION AND THAT'S WHY I STARTED THE PRESENTATION THE WAY STARTED. DRILLING FOR OIL AND GAS HAPPENS IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE EXPLOSIVE TO THE STOCKS THE COMMISSION SINCE BILL. INCLUDING PERSONAGENS AND ALL KINDS OF TOXINS IN THE AIR NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ONCE WE EXTRACT THE HYDROCARBONS WE HAVE TO TRANSPORT TO REFINERIES. AND OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED AREAS WE KNOW THAT LIVING NEXT TO TRANSPORTATION HOBSON CORRIDORS EXPOSES PEOPLE TO HAVE ELECT LEVELS OF AIRBORNE POLLUTANTS. LIKE FIGHT PLEASE. THEN WE HAVE THE PRODUCTION AND MANUFACTURING AND AGAIN REFINERIES AND FACTORIES ARE REALLY WORKING OUT NEXT TO A EACH DAY COMMUNITIES. I IN THIS FACILITY OFTEN ARE NEXT TO WATERWAYS AND THE POLLUTANTS AND UP IN THE WATERWAYS AND THEY GET A CARRY POLLUTION TO THE OCEAN. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ONCE THE PLASTICS ALREADY FACTOR THEY HAVE TO BE DISTRIBUTED AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE HOUSES HAVE INDIRECT SOURCE EMISSIONS. AND PEOPLE LIVING NEXT DOOR HOUSES ARE ALSO LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR- BEN WILSON NO THAT THEY LIVE NEXT TO THE FREEWAY FOR ALL THESE SINGLE USE BUSES ARE TRANSPORTED. TO AND FROM NEXT LIKE PLEASE. THEN CORPORATION SPEND MARKETING DOLLARS TO ENSURE MAXIMUM PENETRATION IN COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT DOLLAR STORES ARE LOCATED- IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THEY BASICALLY PROMOTE THEIR VALUE BECAUSE OF HOW CHEAP AND CONVENIENT THEY ARE. AND WE KNOW ALSO THAT THEY HAVE. SUBSTANCES LIKE BPA BPF AND FOLLETT'S. THAT ENDS UP HAVING A- TOXIC IMPACT IN IN OUR BODIES ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER TYPES OF CONTAINERS THAT ARE REUSABLE- AND AGAIN THEIR TENDER BASICALLY PROMOTED IN. AJ COMMUNITIES WE ALSO KNOW THAT SHE FABRICS ALSO PROMOTING EAGER COMMUNITIES AND THOSE MICROPLASTICS END UP IN OUR WATERWAYS- IN THOSE ARE AND THE CONGRESS OFFICE AS WELL NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I'M AND AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE USING THESE- CHEAP. AERIALS THAT JUST BREAKDOWN FOR FAIRLY EASY WE KNOW WE HAVE TO HOLD THEM AND THAT MEANS MORE EXPENSIVE DRIVING THEM TO LANDFILLS AND GETTING RID OF THEM- AND THE- THAT WAYS AND THE CREATING. A METHANE AND METHANE IS A REALLY POTENT GAS THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO EVEN IF WE DISCARDED WASTE PROPERLY WE KNOW THAT HE'S GOING TO FIND A WAY TO THE OCEAN AND LAND AND LANDFILLS. UP AGAIN- WHERE PEOPLE OF COLOR LIVE. AND THEY'RE GETTING EXPOSED TO EVEN MORE POLLUTION- SOME OF THE WAYS AND OF BEING INCINERATED AND NOW WE KNOW THAT THEIR ALSO TELLING- WASTE TO ENERGY- SCHEMES THAT ARE ALSO OF. HURTING EITHER COMMUNITIES AND WE NEED TO REALLY FIND A WAY TO STOP THESE. THAT CYCLE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I'M MORE FULLY FROM BEGINNING TO THE OCEAN ALSO MEANS MUCH THAT SOUNDS AN INCREASE OF SENATORS ACIDIFICATION LESSON SILVA FORTUNE OFF CARBON. ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS AFFECTING EITHER COMMUNITIES PROPORTIONALLY AND THE PLASTIC IS CONTRIBUTING TO IT. AB PREVALENCE OF MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN WITH OTHER ADVOCATION FEEL THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN. AND THAT'S AFFECTING BIODIVERSITY AND THE FOOD CHAIN AS A WHOLE MAKEMAKES LIKELY. WE SIMPLY CANNOT RECYCLE THE WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. MOST PROFESSORS ARE NOT RECYCLED AND THOSE THAT DO RECYCLE ONES BECAUSE MANY FACTORS PREFER MATERIALS. AT RECYCLING ALSO GENERATES GREENHOUSE GASES ARE YOU NEED MORE ENERGY TO RECYCLE THOSE PLASTICS. AND RECYCLING PLANTS AND OF ANY TO COMMUNITIES- WORLDWIDE 90% OF PLASTICS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE RECYCLED 12% ARE INCINERATED. AND 79% ARE EITHER LANDFILL OR IN THE IN THE OCEAN. SO WITH THAT I'M CLOSING MY REMARKS AND I'M OPENING FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL SO IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST STANDING BY WE APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT MOVING TO CHELSEA ROCHMAN PROFESSOR WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. WHO I BELIEVE IS BY PHONE IF THE MODERATOR COMPLETES CONNECTOR. AND CAL THE AIRLINE AS THE OPEN. THANK YOU CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME I THINK I'M CONNECTED WE CAN HEAR YOU AND WE ALSO SEE YOUR POWER POINT. OKAY WONDERFUL I CAN'T BUT I WILL- SUGGEST WHEN HIS ADVANCE FLY THAT HOPES WILL BE OKAY. I JUST WANT TO START BY BY THINKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND MCCARTY MCCARTY FOR INVITING ME TO GATHER TO GIVE ME SOME TIME I GUESS TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- MY NAME IS HEALTHY ROCK MAN I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. AND BUT I DID ALL OF MY SCHOOLING IN CALIFORNIA AND LIVED THERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO IT IT. GREAT TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE- TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GROWING EMISSIONS OF MICROPLASTICS MOSTLY FOCUSING ON THEIR IMPACTS AND TO THESE ARE THE BIG PLASTIC THAT EVENTUALLY BREAK DOWN INTO SMALLER CLASSIC. THAT ARE SO. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY. SAY THAT WE ARE AGREE- INTO FIFTEEN. BUT THE WORLD DECIDED THAT EIGHT MILLION TONS OF PLASTIC GOING INTO THE OCEAN WOULD NOT OKAY THIS WAS A FAMOUS DETECT THAT WAS SHARED BY JANET YEAH BACK IN THE PAPER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. YOUR THE NEXT SLIDE WE RECENTLY TRIED TO UPDATE THIS ARE WE GET UPDATE THIS MODEL TO COME UP WITH. MORE AT CURRENT NUMBERS HOW MUCH PLASTIC DEBRIS WAS BEING ADMITTED INTO AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. THIS IS WORK DONE THAT INCLUDED JENNA JAMBECK BUT WAS LED BY DR AL. CAME OUT IN SCIENCE IF YOU WEEKS AGO WE PREDICTED THAT THAT NUMBER HAD INCREASED THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY THREE. MILLION TONS OF PLASTIC BEING ADMITTED INTO YOUR QUALITY CONSISTENT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TODAY IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS. WE HAVEN'T DECREASED OUR EMISSIONS AND FACT WE'VE INCREASED OUR EMISSIONS AND IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. IF YOU FOLLOW THAT YELLOW LINE WE PREDICT THAT UNDER BUSINESS AS USUAL ALL THE WITH NO MEDICATION AND DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY. THAT WILL BE UP TO ALMOST NINETY MILLION TONNES ATTENTION ONLY. BY TWENTY THIRTY WHICH WOULD BE A FOUR FOLD INCREASE FROM THAT TWENTY SIXTEEN NUMBER. LUCKILY NO ONE THE GREED ON THE SCENARIO WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY. TO DISCUSS. PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. AND PART TODAY ABOUT THE IMPACT OF HOW. THESE PLANS AT OUR PARTY KEEP. IN THEY DO TO MARINE AND FOR. LIFE SO KNOW THAT. LARGE PIECES OF PLASTIC LITTER OUR ENVIRONMENT FROM THE POLE TO THE EQUATOR AND FROM THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN TO THE D. T. WHILE WE KNOW THAT BYE WEEK MOST OF THIS MATERIAL IS LARGE PLASTIC. IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THE MAJORITY OF BY COUNTY ARE MICROPLASTICS. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE CONTAMINANT IT INCLUDES MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTIC THAT ARE BROKEN DOWN FROM A DIVERSE AND- NUMBER OF PRODUCTS. THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT CHEMICALS IN THEM THEY RANGE IN DIFFERENT SIZES FROM THE NANO TO MICROMETERS RANGE. IN DIFFERENT SHAPES DIFFERENT COLORS AND DIFFERENT CHEMICALS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND THE NEXT FLIGHT SHOWS BUT THEY'RE EVERYWHERE AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY QUITE PERVASIVE. YOU WANT A LOT ABOUT THIS ISSUE OVER THE YEARS. AND THAT INCLUDES. IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THE FACT THAT THE CONTAMINATION IS REALLY WIDESPREAD SO I SAID THIS EARLIER ABOUT LARGE PLASTIC. MICROPLASTICS ARE OFTEN SEEN IN EVERY SINGLE ECOSYSTEM. NEXT SLIDE. WE ALSO SEE THEM AND HOT. AND SOMETIMES THESE CONCENTRATIONS ARE QUITE HIGH NEXT SLIDE. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE AB Q. ORGANISMS WHERE THE CONCENTRATION OR THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES IN THE BODY WAS ASTOUNDING THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT IN THE BROWN'S BULL HAD TAKEN FROM LAKE ONTARIO NEAR TORONTO WITH NINE HUNDRED FIFTY PARTICLES IN IT STANEK. AND THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT IS THE SHARK THAT HAD MORE THAN THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED PIECES OF PARTICLES OF MICROPLASTIC IN ITS STOMACH. NOW THAT HIGH CONTAMINATION IS NOT JUST RELEVANT TO AQUATIC ANIMAL IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S ALSO RELEVANT TO HUMAN WE EXTRACT RESOURCES FROM OUR OCEAN AND FRESH WATER TO EAT WE ALSO TAKES ALL. ALSO TO EAT. AND IF YOU'RE NOT BY. WE'RE ALSO STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT MICROPLASTIC ISN'T DRINKING WATER. WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT FRESH WATER SYSTEMS IN THE CONTAMINATION THAT THEY HAVE. AND IF FOR EXAMPLE IF I TURN ON MY CAP RIGHT HERE AT HOME IN LAKE ONTARIO THE THREE IMAGES ON THE BOTTOM ARE WHAT WE SEE UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND OUR VERY OWN LAB. SO WE KNOW THAT THEIR ENVIRONMENT IS CONTAMINATED AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S COMING BACK TO HAUNT US ON OUR OWN DINNER PLATE. SO THAT REALLY WAIT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT NEXT SLIDE WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF MICROPLASTICS WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS TO HUMANS AND WHAT ARE THE AFFECTED ANIMALS. THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT I PUT THE FACTS INTO THE TO GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. BIG INCLUDE A STATE MOTIVE IN. PLASTIC UNION JACK. TRANSFERRING TO THE LIVER OR KIDNEY MAY BE CAUSING INFLAMMATION. OR PLASTIC BEING INGESTED IN HIGH CONCENTRATION CAUSING MORTALITY IN A FISH BECAUSE THEY ATE SO MUCH PLASTIC THEY DIDN'T EAT THE FOOD THAT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE. YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. WE SEE EVIDENCE OF A FAX FROM CHEMICALS ADDITIVES TO PLASTIC SO HERE ON THE TOP ARTISTS EXPOSED TO THE LEACHATE THAT TIRED THAT THE COMMON MICRO PLASTIC IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND N. B. AND B. WHERE THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE LEACHATE THEY'VE LOCKED THE PIGMENTATION IN THEIR EYES. THIS IS A CHEMICAL OF FACT WE ALSO SEE IN WORMS AND IN FACT FROM THE MICROPLASTIC WITH ADDITIVES AND THE ADDITIVE ALONE BUT NOT THE PLASTIC IF WE REMOVE THE CHEMICAL ADDITIVE SO EVIDENCE AGAIN OF A CHEMICAL BACK. AND THE NEXT SLIDE SHOWS EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT COULD BE FROM THE CHEMICALS THAT START TO ACCUMULATE ON THE MICROPLASTICS WHEN THEY END UP IN THE ENVIRONMENT. SO THE MINUTE A PIECE OF MICROPLASTIC HIT DATA QUITE ECOSYSTEM START TO ACCUMULATE THE PESTICIDES IN THE FLAME RETARDANT IN THE METALS AND THE OTHER CHEMICALS THAT ARE THERE AND THOSE CAN ALSO CAUSE INCREASED. AS YOU SEE ON THE TOP RIGHT OR EVEN THE TUMOR IN THE LIVER OF A FISH BUT YOU SEE AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT AND THESE ARE STUDIES WE'VE DONE IN MY LAB BOTH AT UC DAVIS WHEN I WAS AT MY POST DOC AS WELL AS- IN MY LAB HERE IN TORONTO. SO THE NEXT FLIGHT GET THREE. THE ACTUALLY YOU WANT JUST GO ALL THE WAY TO THE WHITE YOU CAN THE THREE THINGS. THERE'S A QUICK IF YOU TO. THIS SHOW THAT THERE IS AN- YOU MICHAEL. MAKING THE DIFFERENT TACK. BUT THEY ALSO IN ORGANISMS ACROSS THE WELL OF BY. OR SO THEY CAN CAUSE A TOXIC EFFECT IN THE BODY BUT THOSE EFFECTS CAN ALSO LEAD TO A POPULATION LEVEL ATTRACT. INCREASING OR DECREASING THE POPULATION. MORE CHANGING THE COMMUNITY. SO ON THE NEXT FLIGHT WHICH SHOULD LOOK LIKE A I AM A WHITE GRASS WITH LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION ON THE ON THE Y. AXIS THROUGHOUT THE LAST AT THE SIDE OF ON THE BOTTOM. WE LOOK ACROSS THE LITERATURE CARE GIPHY HOW MUCH EVIDENCE IS THERE AN IMPACT FROM PLASTIC. SO YOU'RE GONNA BE IN A MINUTE WHAT HOW MUCH EVIDENCE THERE IS. AND THE DARKER THE SHEETING THE MORE EVIDENCE THERE IS. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THESE BOXES ARE GOING TO CORRESPOND WITH THE SIZE OF THE PLASTIC FOR THE THINK. BIG PLASTIC NOW AND THE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE YOU CAN SEE. HOW MUCH EVIDENCE THERE IS ABOUT A ONE HALF TO AQUATIC BIOTA. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE FROM MY GRIP THAT MICROPLASTIC IMPACT ANIMALS ACROSS MANY LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANISATION. MORAXELLA IN THOSE LOWER LEVEL BECAUSE THOSE ARE FROM LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. WE DON'T DOES LARGE ANIMALS WITH MACRO PLASTICS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE GRAPH YOU'RE SEEING ANIMALS THAT WASHED UP WITH. LACERATIONS ARE PLASTIC IN THERE GOT TO COST MORTALITY. THANK YOU ARE THE NEXT FIGHT YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS EVIDENCE HAS INCREASED FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN. TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE BOXES ARE FILLED AND THE SCALE OF THE BOXES. HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. HOWEVER IF YOU CLICK ON THE NEXT SLIDE. YOU CAN SEE THAT WE ALL THE ADMIN THAT SOMETIMES MAKE A PLASTIC DOES BECAUSE OF THE FACT. IN SOME. THAT WE CAST IN OREGON FOR FACT. WE MIGHT NOT GET. THEY THAT WERE LOOK FOR YEAH SEE THAT LESS STOCKS WITH MAC CLASS. BUT THE THREE THE OF. IF YOU GO TO THE NET IDEA CAN SEE THE HAVE TO DO IT HOW. CLASS IS IN THE IN. THE TYPE AND SHAPE OF PLASTIC BEAR THE ANNA THAT IT INTERACTS WITH BY THE PLASTIC OR IN A STUDY HOW THEY GET THEIR EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. BUT THE LAST FRIDAY WHEN I SHOW YOU BEFORE IRAQ THAT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO ASK IF YOU GO TO THAT NEXT FIGHT WITH THAT THE GRAPH AND THE PICTURES. THE WORLD SHOULD BE THERE TO PAPER THAT DEMONSTRATED THROUGH MODEL THAT WITH THE EVIDENCE WE CURRENTLY HAVE THERE'S ALREADY ENOUGH PLASTIC IN SOME PARTS OF THE OCEAN. AND SOME PARTS OF FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS BETTER CAUSING AN IMPACT. WE'RE SEEING EVIDENCE OF MEASURABLE RISK ARE READY AND WE EXPECT MORE IF WE CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL. SO TO CONCLUDE JEFF CAN'T GO GIVE IT AN OVERALL SUMMARY WE KNOW THAT LARGE PLASTIC DEBRIS CAN HARM WILDLIFE THERE'S NO DOUBT. FOR MICROPLASTICS THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT IT CERTAINLY CAN'T THE WHEN AND HOW WITH A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED. BUT WE KNOW THAT MICROPLASTICS ARE ALREADY LEADING TO MEASURABLE RISK IN FRESHWATER AND MARINE ECOSYSTEM. THE WHILE WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF MICROPLASTICS WE ALSO SHOULD START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN REDUCE. MICROPLASTIC IN BIG PLASTIC. THE MISSION THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK VERY MUCH PROFESSOR IF YOU TO MIND BY WHILE WE TO OUR LAST. IN THEM OVER TO BACK FOR QUESTION. THANK YOU ARE LAST S FOR THE FIRST PANEL IS TERROR BROKE WITH THE OCEAN WITH OSHANA. AND MODERATOR WOULD YOU MIND CONNECTING TERROR BROKE. AT INTERIOR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU AND I CAN'T SEE MY POWER POINT BUT- WILL ALSO- TRUCK BUT IT'S UP AND- HAVE PLAYED THE DANCE THAT BY WORK THROUGH MY PRESENTATION YES WE CAN SAY IT AGAIN LEAVING IS TERRA. OKAY GREAT- THE VIDEO THE LITTLE THE LANE SO I APOLOGIZE BUT I'M NOT ABLE TO BE THERE IN PERSON OR OR VIA VIDEO- BUT THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TO PARTICIPATE TODAY- I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT YOU'VE YOU'VE HEARD MUCH OF THAT- BEFORE- AS THE CHAIR SAID IN THE BEGINNING MANY FOLKS ARE NOW VERY FAMILIAR WITH THESE ISSUES AND- YOU HEARD- FROM FROM OUR PREVIOUS WITNESSES WHILE SO HOPEFULLY I CAN MOVE QUICKLY COULD ACTUALLY. GET GET THE QUEUE IN A- SO. ONE THING I ALL LIKE THE ABOUT IN THE WHERE HAS. THE WE ARE A PLAN AND- OCEANS COVER MORE. THAT PERCENT OF OUR OR THIRD FAT. AND ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO LIFE ON OUR PLANET BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE 50% OF THE EARTH OXIGEN. AND DESPITE THE OCEAN IMPORTANT TO LIFE ON EARTH. THEY ARE LITERALLY STARTING TO CHOKE ON PLASTIC AND AS ONE FINDS THAT RECENTLY PUT IT. THE OCEANS ARE PUTTING PLASTIC BACK AT US WITH EVERYWHERE. SO OUR ENVIRONMENT AS YOU'VE HEARD HAS BEING INUNDATED WITH THE MATERIAL THAT DOESN'T BIODEGRADE IT BUILDS UP IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THREATENS MARINE ANIMALS AS WELL AS HUMAN. AND THE VERSATILITY AND DURABILITY OF PLASTIC IS WHAT REALLY BECAUSE IT'S BECOME SO PREVALENT AND PERSISTENT IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND WHILE WE FOCUS ON OCEAN PLASTIC HAVE BEEN FOUND AROUND THE GLOBE IN FRESHWATER LAKES AND MELTING ARCTIC SEA ICE AND RAIN COLLECTED IN THE MOUNTAINS AND IN THE AIR ABOUT THE FRENCH PEYRONIE'S- SO WE ARE REALLY SEEING CLASSIC THROUGHOUT OUR- OUR CLUB. AND I FIGHT THE ALBATROSS FOR FLORIDA THE- POSTER CHILD FOR OCEAN PLASTIC POLLUTION AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF MILES ACROSS THE OCEAN TO FEED AT B. AND THEIR PREFERRED PREFERRED SHOULD IT WHAT AND WHICH TEND TO ATTACH THEMSELVES THE FLOATING PIECES OF PLASTIC. AND PLASTIC BOTTLE VERY OFTEN BRIGHTLY COLORED AND SO AT THE TRACTOR TO AN ANIMAL FLYING ABOVE A VERY FAST OCEAN. AN ADULT ALL THE TRAPS WELL THEN WHO IS THAT AND FEED THEM TO THEIR CHECK TO BELIZE WILL PULL UP THE CLASSIC MAKING THEM FEEL FALL. EVEN THOUGH THEY LACK ANY REAL NOURISHMENT AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN THE PICTURES OF ALBATROS CHECK- WITH THEIR BELLY FULL PACKED- PLASTICS THAT WORK THAT HAS START TO THAT. BUT ALL THE TRUCKS ARE FAR FROM THE ONLY BIRD SPECIES THREATENED BY PLASTIC. 90% OF THE BIRD SPECIES HAVE CONSUMED PLASTIC THE RESULT OF WHICH- CAN BE FATAL. OUR NEXT BY IT'S- WHEN EXPERT ON OF THE MATH MARK AND THEN I. FIFTIES IT WAS REALLY FELLOW FROM LIFE MARKET. AND TODAY AS WE KNOW DRINK OUR COFFEE OUT OF PLASTIC CUPS WITH THE FACT THAT LIDS AND- STRAWS. AND OUR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND CLEANING SUPPLIES ARE ALL PACKED. IT REALLY MAKES OUR LIFE EASIER AND FOR PRETTY CHEAP. AND AS YOU AS YOU HEARD SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS- PRESENTATIONS AN ESTIMATED EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS ENTERED THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT LANDAY SOURCES EVERY YEAR. AND THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT SEVENTEEN POINT SIX BILLION POUNDS OF PLASTIC. AND ONCE THEY GET THERE IT DOESN'T TEND TO GO AWAY. AND EVERY YEAR THE OCEAN CONSERVANCY ORGANIZES AN ERROR. THE WORLD COLLECT AND RECORD DECLINE ALONG OUR CLOTHES. AND THE DATA COMPILED INTO AN ANNUAL REPORT REVEALING THE MOST COMMONLY COLLECTED ITEMS. I ONE OF THE BIGGEST OFFENDERS THAT WE SEE ARE SINGLE USE PLASTICS PARTICULARLY FOOD WHERE AND PACKAGING. MOORLACH BUT LACKS I THINK. AN ESTIMATED SEVEN HUNDRED WEARING JEANS AND QUITTING MANY ENDANGERED SPECIES ARE AFFECTED BY MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION EVEN THOUGH PLANTS AND AS YOU HEARD TINY MARINE ORGANISMS THAT FORM THE BASE OF THE OCEAN FOOD CHAIN ARE EATING PLASTIC WHICH THAN CAN ACCUMULATE AND LARGER OCEAN PREDATORS LIKE FISH THAT WE EAT. AND THAT'S BECAUSE PLASTIC LOOK LIKE THOSE OF FOR EXAMPLE PICTURES PLASTIC BACK IN OCTOBER. ONE OF THE FEATURED OLD FAVORITE JELLY. AND I TWENTY STUDY THAT INVESTIGATED PLASTIC AND A HUNDRED AND TO SEE A TURTLE FOUND PLASTIC IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY AND INVESTIGATED. AND I'M SURE MANY HAD SEEN THE VIDEO THAT HURDLE WHAT THAT STRAW LOGINIS KNOWS THAT WENT VIRAL A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND RELEASED BIRDS- PUSH BACK ON THE USE OF. MILLION PLASTIC STRAWS NATIONWIDE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND EVERYTHING LOTTERY THEIR CAR REACHED AND STUDY FOUND CLASS THROUGHOUT THE WATER COLUMN FROM THE SURFACE THE PEOPLE AND IN EVERY ANIMAL THAT THEY SAMPLED AND THE PHOTOS HERE IS THAT THE DEEP SEA CRAB HOLDING A PIECE OF PLASTIC THAT WAS TAKEN BY MY COLLEAGUE DURING A TWENTY FOURTEEN EXPEDITION OF THE SEAMOUNTS INSANE BUT TAKE AWAY HERE AND IT'S- A CLASSIC A PERFECT MEMORY IMPAIRMENT AND IT IS EVERYWHERE NOT QUITE. THESE AND TWENTY FIFTH THE LOOKS THING MORE THAN FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS OF PLASTIC EVERY YEAR MORE THAN A THIRD OF WHICH- IT'S FOR PACKAGING. WHICH IS OFTEN USED ONCE AND THROWN AWAY. AND PLASTIC PRODUCTION ISN'T BUYING NOW IN FACT IT'S GROWING FASTER THE NETWORK AND BY TWENTY FIFTEEN WE ARE PROJECTED TO BE PRETTY THING FOUR TIMES AS MUCH PLASTIC. AS WE WERE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND ALMOST ALL PLASTICS ARE MADE FROM POP APPEAL WHICH HAVE YOU HEARD CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE FROM EXTRACTION TO PUT PRODUCTION TO THE VERY END OF LIFE A PLASTIC. I'M SORRY BUT I MIGHT HAVE IF THE FLAG SO YOUR POLICY AYE AND THAT'S LIKELY. I HOPE YOU ARE SEEING A GRAPH AT THAT POINT- AND THAT THAT WAS THE GRAPH I WAS JUST REFERRING TO ON THE PLASTIC PRODUCTION TO CLOSE YOUR FILE- QUITE A PLANE FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND IF YOU CAN QUIT NOW THE FULL PART AS AN ANIMATION- THAT WRITERS RECENTLY CREATED VISUALIZING THE NUMBER OF PLASTIC BOTTLES BEING SOLD GLOBALLY- SHOWING THE SIZE OF THE PILE GROWING OVER TIME TO REFLECT THE NUMBER OF BOTTLES BEING PURCHASE. MPK BOTTLED ARE COMMONLY USED AS WE NOW BURKE OFFERING SOME WATER BUT CAN ALSO BE USED IN OTHER HOUSEHOLD OR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND DATA SHOWS THAT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY BILLION OF THESE BOTTLES WERE SOLD IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONG WHICH IS ALMOST A MILLION EVERY MINUTE. AND IT FIFTY ONE PERCENT- THEN WHAT WITH THE OLD AND TWO THOUSAND NINE. WHAT THAT'S WONDERFUL MINUTE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE DUMP TRUCK REALLY- IS LONG GONE AND YOU'RE. LEFT WITH A MOUNTAIN OF PLASTIC BOTTLES. I'M NOT QUITE. SO IF YOU LET THAT PLAY ILLUSTRATIONS REALLY SHALL THAT WHAT A PILE FACT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF IT WAS COLLECTED OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THE NUMBER SOLD EVERY DAY BUT CREATE A PILOT HALF THE SIZE OF THE EIFFEL TOWER. NEXT SLIDE. AFTER A MONTH- YOU HAVE FORTY BILLION BOTTLES WHICH WOULD REALLY DOOR THE EIFFEL TOWER. AND BY AND OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THANK YOU THOUSAND NINE YOU HAVE FOUR TRILLION- P. E. T. BOTTLES SOLD WHICH WENT OUR ABOUT NEW YORK CITY AT ABOUT ONE AND A HALF MILE HI. NECKLINE. SO THAT EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT GOING INTO THE OCEAN ANNUALLY THAT IS ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT OF A DUMP TRUCK LOAD EVERY MINUTE AND THE CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS THAT THIS WILL INCREASE DRAMATICALLY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND I THINK WE JUST HEARD WE CAN UPDATED DATA FROM OUR LAST PRESENTER THAT WE MIGHT ALREADY BE HERE AND SO THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN IS REALLY PROJECTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE- IF WE CONTINUE ON THECURRENT COURSE. AND THE IMPACT THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT WHILE THEY COULD REALLY BEAT THE BACKGROUND. NEXT SLIDE. BUT THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS- THE AMOUNT OF COUNTRYWIDE PLASTIC LEGISLATION HAS REALLY INCREASED RAPIDLY IN REPAIRS AS AWARENESS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION BECOMES MORE WIDESPREAD- THERE BEEN POLICIES- PUT FORWARD AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA- SO THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS AND A REAL OPPORTUNITY THERE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY I THINK IT'S THE THINK ABOUT- REAL POLLUTION. PROBLEM NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WE REALLY NEED TO DECIDE WHAT FUTURE WE WANT FOR OUR OCEANS AND FOR OURSELVES AND THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE AMOUNT WE CAN REDUCE FROM TODAY'S PRODUCTION LEVELS THAT TALKED ABOUT PREVENTING THE DOUBLING OF THE AMOUNT JUST IN THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES SO WE NEED TO- FIRST OF ALL REDUCE THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE PRODUCING AND THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING INTO THE OCEAN TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE CAN HAVE A VIBRANT BEAUTIFUL OCEAN THAT THE FUTURE- AND WITH THAT I THINK WE'RE AT THE END OF THIS SECTION. SO WE'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SINCE YOU ARE THE LAST PANELIST YOU'RE GOING TO GET I THINK RELEASED MY FIRST QUESTION. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IT WAS VERY VERY SOBERING. SO IF US I HAVE A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION ASSUMING THAT WE STOPPED ALL PLASTIC POLLUTION GOING INTO THE OCEANS TODAY LET'S SAY WE COULD JUST NOT WAVE A MAGIC WAND THAT I WISHED I HAD. HOW WE CAN STOP THE PRODUCTION OF PLASTIC AND STOP IT FROM GOING IN THE OCEANS. HOW DO WE CLEAN UP THE TRASH THAT'S ALREADY IN THERE WHAT IT WILL IS THERE A WAY TO ROLL BACK THOSE IMPACTS IS IT SOMETHING THAT WILL DISSIPATE OVER TIME OR IS THAT DAMAGE JUST DONE UNTIL WE COME UP WITH SOME BRAND NEW TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION THAT ONE I THINK MANY ARE THINKING ABOUT. I DON'T HAVE A PERFECT ANSWER ONE THING THAT WE DO WELL IS AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING THE OCEANS DO YOU. STING PLASTIC BACKED OUT. SO MUCH OF THAT IS SO FINE LITTLE CLASSICS THAT IT IS A REALLY NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN UP AND THEN BE. WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO CLEAN UP WHILE IN THE OCEAN I'M SURE MANY MANY HAVE HEARD OF THE GREAT OCEAN CLEANUP PROJECT WHICH NOT A LOT OF- FUNDING TO LOOK AT POTENTIALLY CLEANING UP CLASSICAL ABOUT ME OCEAN- BUT IF IT IS A REAL PROBLEM EVEN IF WE STOP ALL CLASSIC TODAY THE CLEAN UP BY THE THINGS IS SOMETHING THAT. WE HAVE NOT WE HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT YET AND I WOULD TURN MY OTHER PANELISTS TO SEE IF THEY HAVE- ANY OTHER THOUGHTS BUT IT IT. THANK YOU I'M GONNA ASK IF ANY OF MY- COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL IS WHY DON'T WE DO A PANELIST BY PANELIST IF POSSIBLE. MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER ON EVERYBODY. OKAY MR MCCARTY BONTA ON THIS SPEAKER YES JUST SPEAKER THEM ALTOGETHER SO SURE- YOU KNOW CLEARLY WHAT YOU'RE OUTLINING. ARE THE IMAGES THAT THAT WE ALL SEE AND THAT DOES NOT GET ALL OF OUR- HEARTS NO MATTER. HOW YOU THINK ABOUT. THE PLASTIC SEVENTY ONE THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY IT DISTURBS THEM SAYING. ANIMALS YOU KNOW HARD IN AND THEY- SAID AND THE IMPACT TO OUR- ENVIRONMENT WE- QUESTIONS FOR YOU ON ON THE- HEALTH IMPACTS. IT WITH WHAT WAS A TURNING POINT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE DISTURBED SEEING THE PICTURE OF THE TURTLE- THE BIRD AND THEN THEY GO BACK AND GET THAT STARBUCKS LATTE AND JUST GO ON WITH OUR LIVES RIGHT. BUT AT SOME POINT WHEN THERE IS AN IMPACT ON OUR- ON OUR HEALTH- YOU KNOW THAT'S A PEOPLE START TO REALLY MAKE DECISIONS BUT DIFFERENTLY. SO WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENED THE LAST FEW YEARS AS FAR AS THE- AS FAR AS THE- LOOKING AT THE REAL IMPACT OR IS IT TOO EARLY IS IT GOING TO BE YOU KNOW. DECADES DOWN THE ROAD DECADES DOWN THE ROAD. HELP YOUR BACK BUTTON FOR ME YEAH THESE THE QUESTIONS ARE ALL FOR YOU RIGHT NOW AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE NEXT PANELISTS JUST TO MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER. OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU I'M SORRY YEAH. ONE MOMENT ONE MOMENT CHECK WAS FOR CHELSEA OR FORD. WAS IS FOR CHELSEA OR FOR TERROR PROP FROM OSHANA- I THINK OKAY LAST SPEAKER. THIS ACTUALLY IS OVER TERROR BRAUCHT. SORRY THAT'S OKAY. YOU CAN ANSWERED AFTER AS WELL. MS BROCK ARE YOU THERE. LOOKS LIKE HERE HAS DISCONNECTED OKAY INTERVENTIONAL THEN THIS ROTH A PROFESSOR YOU'RE ON. OKAY SO I WOULD IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION RIGHT MOST OF THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT AND HOW MICROPLASTICS OR PLASTIC POLLUTION IN GENERAL IMPACT WILDLIFE BUT AS YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A BILL THAT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DEFINE MICROPLASTICS RELEVANT YOU DRINKING WATER EVENTUALLY WE NEED TO HAVE A METHOD TO QUANTIFY IT IN DRINKING WATER WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT TOO MUCH THOUGH THAT WHAT WE- MEASURE THAT AMOUNT WE CAN SAY WHETHER OR NOT IT MEANS WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF DRINKING WATER SO THERE'S A WORKING GROUP RIGHT NOW. I IN CALIFORNIA OF EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD YOU COMING TOGETHER TO SURVEY THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE THERE IS SOME RESEARCH ON MICROPLASTICSIN HUMAN HEALTH BUT IT'S LIMITED I TRY TO COME UP WITH THOSE NUMBERS SO YOUR QUESTION IS GOOD AND I WOULD SAY THAT IN ABOUT FIVE OR. SIX MONTHS WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER IT. OKAY THANK YOU- I HAVEN'T ANOTHER QUESTION THIS IS FOR FRANKLY FOR ANYBODY HERE BUT I WAS STRUCK BY THE VERY FIRST- SLIDE FROM THE ELADIO WHICH WAS TALKED ABOUT HOW. THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC- WASTE OUR LANDFILLS AND IN GENERAL HAS INCREASING BECAUSE MOST THE PUBLIC THINKS WE RECYCLE IT IT'S ALL GOOD JUST THERE THAT WAS GOING FOR A WALK IN THEIR KIDS. HEY PROTECT THE REFILLABLE WATER BOTTLES NOT NOT THOSE ARE THE ONES IS AVAILABLE TO RECYCLE THAT'S FINE IT'S ALL GOOD AND- WE THINK THAT. THAT'S WHY HAVE THE BIG BAND BUT IT DOES ALWAYS- WORK THAT WAY AND I AND I LIKE WITH THE FIRST SPEAKER TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICES DOLLAR STORES EVERYTHING IS. PLASTIC AND DISPOSABLE AND IT'S SUPER CHEAP BUT PEOPLE THINK I'LL THROW IT IN THE BLUE BAND. IT'S ALL GOING TO BE- ALL GONNA BE RECYCLED SO. YOU KNOW IT WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO. FROM THE PUBLIC TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL THE STUFF IS NOT. RECYCLE I THINK THAT HISTORICALLY WE JUST THINK. THAT BLUE BANDS GONNA SOLVE ALL OF OUR WELLS PUT EVERYTHING IN THAT LOOP AND EVERYTHING BE RECYCLED SO- IS IT JUST A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING. FROM FROM FROM THAT POLICY MAKERS AND FOR THE PUBLIC AS FAR AS WHAT IS. RECYCLABLE THAT THAT HINDERS OUR ABILITY TO BRING ABOUT. CHANGE MAYBE IT ISN'T A QUESTION IS THE STATEMENT BUT- I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW A BIG ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IN THIS IN THE SPACE. IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO- SAY SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T THAT WE CAN FIND. SO ANYBODY WANTS TO COMMENT ON THAT- FEEL FREE IF NOT WE CAN JUST GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION I'M TOLD THAT- TERROR PROFITS BACK ON AS WELL. OKAY I THINK WE'RE GOOD- I GUESS I'LL JUST ASK A FEW QUESTIONS- FOR I KNOW THAT PROFESSOR. ROTHMAN IS THERE MY QUESTION IS WHAT WE KNOW WHETHER WE KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE MICRO PLASTICS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND I'VE READ THAT THERE IS SOME LINK PERHAPS TO PLASTIC BEING AN ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOR AND POSSIBLE- IMPACTS TO HUMAN HEALTH WITH ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION BUT I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH WE ACTUALLY KNOW. HOW MUCH WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA THAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE SHOULD HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT PLASTICS AND THEIR IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH. YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW IS WE KNOW WE'RE EXPOSED SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE DRINK MICROPLASTICS IN WATER. WE EAT IT WITH OURS THE FOOD AND IT'S INVEST SO WE ALSO BEAT IT WHEN IT LANDS ON THE FOOD THAT WE'RE EATING OR POTENTIALLY IN HELL IT. AYE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE STATE OF IT IN THE BODY WE KNOW THAT IT CAN TRANSFER FROM THE GUIDE INTO. THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM AND THEN INTO THE LIVER AND WE SEE IT SOMETIMES THE MUSCLE TISSUE OF FISH. AT THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THE SMALLER THE PLASTIC IS YOU HAVE THIS SYSTEMIC AVAILABILITY. IN THE BODY- WE KNOW MORE. HOW THAT IMPACTS FISH AND OTHER ORGANISMS THAN WE DO FOR HUMANS. PART OF THAT REASON IS WE CAN'T EXPERIMENT WITH HUMAN- BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME STUDIES ON MICE THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT THESE MICROPLASTICS CAN LEAD TO INFLAMMATION. THAT THEY CAN CHANGE AND GREEN EXPRESSIONS THAT YOU ASK IF THEY CAN IN INTERACT WITH THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM. IN HUMANS THAT HAPPENED AND LOOK AT IT KIND IT'S MOSTLY. I JEAN EXPO THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE NEEDS SYSTEM FUNCTION. BUT IN FISH WE HAVE BEEN. EVIDENCE OF ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION RELEVANT Q. CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION THAT ARE RELEVANT TO HOW MANY EGGS CAN LAY AND ALSO. I CHANGES IN THAT GOMEZ AT EMAIL FISH EXPECTING FEMININE CHARACTERISTICS SO. THEY CAN INTERACT WITH A DIFFERENT SYSTEM HOW MUCH THEY DO IN HUMANS OUR STILL IS TO HAVE A BIT LEARN. THANK YOU- BY OTHER IS BESIDES IT SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON THE EFFECT OF- OF MICROPLASTICS IN HUMAN HEALTH AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO CERTAINLY DO A LOT MORE RESEARCH ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE OR REMOVE THE PLASTICS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE OCEAN IF OR ANY OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH THAT YOU WISH WE WERE- INVESTING MORE AND I MEAN WHAT ELSE WHAT ARE THE OTHER BIG UNKNOWNS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT WE SHOULD BE. LOOKING AT. I THINK THE THING THAT THAT I WOULD STAY IT RUNS. AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT. IT ISN'T ABOUT THE IMPACT BUT I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. IN ORDER KIDS THINK ABOUT THE MOST THAT. MISSION AFFECTED WAY TO ACT. IF THEY THINK WE NEED LOCAL MONETARY SO I WAS INVOLVED IN A STUDY IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY. LOOKING AT MICRO PLASTICS AND WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT ROAD RUNOFF THAT. WE THOUGHT WHAT THE TIRE THAT'S COMING IN STORMWATER. ABOUT THE MICROFIBERS WITH WATER TREATMENT PLANTS WE KNOW THAT'S IMPORTANT PATH WHERE SPORTS INDICATED. I THINK IF WE START LOCAL MONITORING PROGRAMS WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE SOURCES. WHICH CAN HELP FORCE REDUCTION AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE WE NEED TO KEEP RESEARCHING. THE IMPACT ECOSYSTEMS AND HUMAN HEALTH BUT THAT ON GOING. AND I THINK UNDERSTANDING THE COURSES CAN HELP BACK AND. START THE MITIGATION PROCESS. THANK YOU I MEAN I'M TO. MS LEON GROW. WHO I THINK TO AN ONE OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS THAT WAS ASKED. ARE YOU THERE. YES I'M HERE- I WANTED TO ANSWER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MCCARTHY'S QUESTION ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THE FACT THAT A LOT OF RECYCLING AND SUB BEING LANDFILLED. AND I THINK IT WAS THE REASON WE ARE HERE WAS BECAUSE OF AN INTENTIONAL CAMPAIGN BY THE INDUSTRY. PUTTING THE BURDEN BACK ON OFF THE CONSUMERS AND IT JUST FEELS GOOD TO PUT STUFF IN THE RECYCLING BIN I EVEN SEE MORE RECYCLING BINS I SEE TWO OR EVEN THREE. RECYCLING BINS WHEN I GO FOR A WALK- AND PEOPLE JUST THINK YOU KNOW JUST BEFORE CARPORT THERE I JUST PUT MORE CLASSICS THERE AND EVERYTHING'S GOING TO YOU KNOW GO AND GET RECYCLED. EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE UNTIL I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO COMBAT THAT IS. A CAMPAIGN TO INFORM THE PUBLIC THIS IS THE REALITY OF THINGS- THERE'S ALSO ALSO THE FACT THAT A LOT MORE PEOPLE MIGHT BE ORDERING STUFF ONLINE- SO THAT YOU KNOW THEY JUST THINK WE'LL ALL JUST RECYCLE. THAT INSTEAD OF- YEAH. PURCHASING WITH MY AND MORE FOR CONSCIENCE AND HOW. DO WE IMPLEMENT. POLICIES THAT ARE NOT GOING TO AFFECT. HOW PEOPLE BUY IT AND OTHER BEHAVIOR SO AGAIN I THINK IT JUST GOES TO. SHOW THAT- YOU KNOW. COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR THE INDUSTRY ARE WORKING WELL AND PUTTING YOU KNOW THINGS ON ON A ON A BLOOP AND- JUST MAKES PEOPLE FEEL GOOD AND- AND THAT'S THE END OF IT BUT HE'S CLEARLY NOT THE SOLUTION AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THE POINT- AND TIMES THAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND HE'S- FROM. GOING TO GET WORSE IF WE DON'T ACT NOW I HAVE A QUESTION I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU WHY YOU'RE HERE. WHEN WE TRY TO TALK TO INDUSTRY OR PASSED BILLS OR LEGISLATION. CURBING THE USE OF PLASTIC OR MANDATING MORE RECYCLED CONTENT INTO. PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING PRODUCED THE INDUSTRY USUALLY RESPONDS BY COMING BACK AND SAYING WELL IF WE DO THIS IS GOING TO MAKE OUR PRODUCTS SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND THAT'S GONNA HURT LOW INCOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD. TO PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS ANYMORE AND I'M WONDERING HOW YOU WOULD ANSWER. THAT ARGUMENT. WELL I MEAN THERE'S SOME INDUSTRY THAT UNDOUBTEDLY WILL HAVE TO GO AWAY JUST BECAUSE THE- BUSINESS MODEL THAT THEY HAVE. THE ANSWER TO OUR- POLLUTION ESPECIALLY PLUS A SINGLE USE PLASTIC POLLUTION. IS TO CUT IT AT THE SOURCE. AND WE KNOW THAT THE PLASTIC INDUSTRIES HIGHLY AUTOMATED. SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS JUST REALLY. GO BACK TO REUSABLE AND THAT'S A NEW TYPE OF ECONOMY AN ECONOMY THAT WE NEED TO BE PROMOTING. SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY- I GREW UP IN MEXICO CITY WHERE EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH- ESPECIALLY BEVERAGES WHERE. A REUSABLE AND WE JUST STARTED ANYTHING THEY- WILL REFILL IT. SO WE KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE IF THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST. CITIES IN THE WORLD CAN DO IT. I KNOW CALIFORNIA CAN DO IT. SO IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING BUSINESS. AND WE JUST NEED TO CHANGE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE GETTING HURT FROM EXTRACTION. TO THE WAY THAT WE'RE PRODUCING THE MATERIALS OF THE WAY WE'RE CONSUMING WE KNOW LOW INCOME PEOPLE GETTING HURT WITH DIFFERENT DISEASES CANCER AND EVEN DEATH. SO THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER. GREAT THANK YOU. I WOULD ASK MY- COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. GOVERNMENT'S GARCIA. THIS THANK YOU I. WE ARGUED TALKED US ABOUT HOW MICROPLASTICS ARE FOUND IN OUR SEAFOOD AND IN OUR WATER CAN YOU ELABORATE ON OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WERE CONSUMING THAT ALSO ARE ALSO CONTAMINATED WITH MICROPLASTICS THE PROBLEM MUCH WETTER THAN TO. RECEIVE FOOD. WELL I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION COMES UP I MEAN OR EVEN FREEZING MICROPLASTICS AT THIS POINT BECAUSE OF THE PREVALENCE. OF IS EVEN IN THE RAIN IT'S EVERYWHERE AT THIS POINT SO AND WE KNOW EVEN IN THE FISH IS NOT JUST IN THEIR GUTS EVEN UNDER SKIN. SO WE KNOW WE'RE- CONSUMING MAP OF MICROPLASTICS IN IN MORE WAYS THAT WE CAN EVEN THINK OFF- AND IT'S JUST GOING TO KEEP. GROWING THE PROBLEM IS GOING TO KEEP GROWING ON UNLESS WE TAKE ACTION AND WE TAKE IT SWIFTLY. DO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF ACTUAL LIKE I BELIEVE YOU REALLY START THAT AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE COULD RECYCLE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM I DO BELIEVE. SO HE'S WILL BACK TO ELEMENTARY CAMPAIGN- EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT WE HAD WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THE REDUCE. REUSE RECYCLE. I RECYCLE BIN OUR LAST OPTION. I THEIR- BOB BIG ARE WE ARE WE TRY. SINCE I'M MORE SYSTEMIC WAY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT CASE. TO THE PUBLIC OF YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE FIND IT IN AT WHAT LEVELS IF I NEEDED TO BE ON. THESE TWO ITEMS I BELIEVE THAT IT'S MUCH WIDER THAN AND JUSTICE BUT DO WE HAVE SOME SORT OF. ACTUAL DATABASE GOING IN THE SAME THING THAT ARE POLLUTION THAT WE HAVE A METRIC. IN OUR POLLUTION TRACKERS OUT THERE. I MEAN WE HAVE LIKE I PERCENT- THE CALIBER SCREEN THAT WE KNOW THAT- POLLUTION IS HURTING OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE. THE OIL WELLS ARE CONNECTED TO PLASTIC BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GETTING THE PLASTIC. AND I MEAN WE CAN DO A STUDY IN TERMS OF THE LIFE CYCLE HOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT BY. THE PLASTICS ECONOMY. AND HOW MUCH WE CAN SAVE. NOT ONLY BY HOLDING OUT THE WASTE BUT ALSO- HOW MUCH MONEY WE CAN SAVE IN TERMS OF HEALTH SAVINGS. FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING SICK RIGHT NOW FROM THE CYCLE. BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE IN THE CALAVERAS SCREENER IS THERE A METRIC FOR MICROPLASTICS RIGHT NOW. AND. SHOULD BE ALSO THE CONVERSE SCREEN THERE'S NO OVERLAY- IN TERMS OF LIKE WHERE ALL THE OIL WELL FIRE I DID THAT MYSELF BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE CONGRESSMAN TO HAVE. THERE'S BEEN READING ABOUT HOW- OIL COMPANIES ARE INVESTING MORE INTO PETROL CHEMICALS THAT ARE MOVING MORE THEIR BUSINESS IN THAT DIRECTION AS- MAYBE OTHER. TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF OIL CONSUMPTION HAS HAS BEEN GOING DOWN. AND THEY'VE WE'VE SEEN. THAT DOLLARS THAT THEY'VE INVESTED IN SELLING AS THE IDEA OF RECYCLING. AS AN OPTION OF PUTTING THINGS INTO THE BLUE BIN EVEN THOUGH THE SUN TEMPLE SETS UP THE SEXY BEING RECYCLED. DO WE KNOW F. AS THEIR SINUSES IDEA RECYCLING IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECYCLE THIS MATERIAL. SPENDING MORE THAN ANYTHING TO SPENDING ADVERTISING DOLLARS TRYING TO SELL US ON THE IDEA OF RECYCLING. OTHER PROBABLY GOING TO SPEND SOME MONEY ON RECYCLING PLANTS KNOWING THAT THE MORE THEY CONVINCE US ALL THAT RECYCLING WORKS THE MORE THEY CAN PUSH MORE PLASTICS SO YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO ANY OF THE PANELISTS- MISTER MURATSUCHI IF YOU'RE THERE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE. FIND A WAY TO LET US KNOW. OKAY WILL MOVE INTO OUR NEXT PANEL I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR FIRST PANEL THAT WAS VERY SOBERING AND REALLY IMPORT INFORMATION SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OUR SECOND PANEL IS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF PLASTICS AT THE LOCAL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL WE'RE GONNA BE JOINED BY RITA CAPITALIST WITH THE LAWSUIT WHO IS THE LOS ANGELES CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICER. JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE HELLER WITH CAL RECYCLE CAL RECYCLE. FOR WE CAN HAVE OUR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. FIRST WITNESS WILL BE RITA TEMPLE OFF. THESE IN THE REMOTE IF THERE YOU ARE THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE YOUR POWER POINT ON OUR SCREEN WE CAN SEE YOU AND WE CAN SEE THE POWER POINT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. A GOOD AFTERNOON SHARES FRIEDMAN MCCARTY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS RITA COMPLEMENT AND I'M WITH LA COUNTY'S CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE- START OFF I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE PART OF TODAY'S PANEL. AND AS JUST A VERY BRIEF BACKGROUND ABOUT OUR OFFICE. OUR OFFICE WAS FORMED SEVERAL YEARS AGO BY THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WITH OUR MAIN CHARGE BEING TO CREATE THE COUNTIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY PLAN WHICH WE'RE PROUD TO SAY WAS ADOPTED. LAST YEAR BY OUR BOARD- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY GREAT THE GOAL FOR THE PLAN WAS TO OUTLINE AN AMBITIOUS A COMPREHENSIVE AND REGIONAL VISION FOR SUSTAINABILITY FOR THE COUNTY WHICH IS CAPTURED IN THE PLANTS TWELVE HIGH LEVEL CROSS SECTORAL GOALS WHICH YOU SEE HERE YOU CAN GO TO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE- I WILL DEFINITELY NOT GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE BUT WHAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT AS WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. WASTE MANAGEMENT AND SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTE IN PARTICULAR ROSE UP TO THE TOP AS KEY PRIORITIES FOR THE COUNTY TO ADDRESS. SO THAT IS WHY WE ENDED UP WITH THE GOLD WHICH IS THE THIRD ONE DOWN THAT YOU SEE I'M IN THE BLUE BOX- CENTERED ON HOW WE MANAGE AND HOW TO MINIMIZE WASTE SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION OF RESOURCES. IN ADDITION THOUGH I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT ANOTHER GOAL WHICH IS MAYBE THE ONE THAT'S CAPTURED THE MOST ATTENTION FROM OUR PLAN- IS THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS FOR A FOSSIL FUEL FREE L. A. COUNTY. THAT HOUSING ASSOCIATED TARGET FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY FOR THE COUNTY. BY TWENTY FIFTY. IN LINE WITH THE STATE GOALS OF COURSE AS WELL AS OUR BOARD STATED COMMITMENT TO THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT. WE SEE TACKLING OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES IN PARTICULAR ADDRESSING SINGLE USE PLASTICS AS KEY TO ACHIEVING THESE GOALS- AS HAS BEEN NOTED BY SPEAKERS BEFORE ME- AS THE WORLD IS SLOWLY MOVING AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS AS AN ENERGY SOURCE. OIL COMPANIES ARE RAMPING UP PRODUCTION OF THESE PLASTICS AND- PLASTIC MATERIALS. SO IT'S REALLY INCUMBENT UPON US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE MATERIALS BECAUSE THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE NOW ARE ONLY GONNA GET. BIGGER IN THE FUTURE. SO NEXT LIFE PLEASE. ALL THAT SAID- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE COUNTY HAS TRIED TO TACKLE OVER THE YEARS. SO ONE OF THE FIRST EFFORTS WAS A BAN ON EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE FOOD CONTAINERS- THAT WAS LIMITED TO COUNTY FACILITIES. AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PASS A PLASTIC BAG BAN FOR COUNTY AND UNINCORPORATED AREAS- AND WE'RE PROUD TO SAY THAT WE ARE THE LARGEST RISK. JURISDICTION DO THAT AT THE TIME. MOST RECENTLY JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO OUR BOARD ADOPTED A MOTION DIRECTING OUR OFFICE TO LOOK AT SINGLE USE FOODSERVICE WHERE. SPECIFICALLY FIRST OFF WE WERE DIRECTED TO CONTRACT WITH UCLA'S LUSKIN SCHOOL OF POLICY TO PUT TOGETHER A STUDY OF THE SPECIFIC IMPACT THAT THESE PRODUCTS HAVE ON L. A. COUNTY. AND THEN FOLLOWING THAT TO DRAFT AN ORDINANCE USING STAKEHOLDER INPUT- SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE NOW TO JUST DISCUSS SOME OF THE KEY POINTS% FROM THE UCLA STUDY WHICH CAME OUT IN JANUARY. SO THE STUDY WAS BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW AS WELL AS INTERVIEWS WITH A NUMBER OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WASTE HAULERS AND MATERIALS RECOVERY FACILITIES. ALTHOUGH WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE WELL KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE MATERIALS WHICH ARE FIRST PANEL DISCUSSED- WE'RE ALSO VERY MUCH DRIVEN BY THE MORE RECENT IMPACTS THE WASTE INDUSTRY ALSO WITH SPRINT NOTED WITH THE CHINA AS- YOU'RE STARTING WITH CHINA'S NATIONAL SWORD POLICY- AND SO A GOOD BIT OF THE UCLA STUDY WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT WASTE MANAGEMENT ASPECT. SO IN TERMS OF KEY FINDINGS. FIRST OF OFFICE OFF WHAT THE UCLA TEAM FOUND THROUGH INTERVIEWS WAS. CONSISTENT WHAT WE YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAD HEARD THROUGH MEDIA AND OTHER REPORTS. DESPITE THERE BEING SEVERANCE SEVEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESIN CODES FOR PLASTICS ALL LABELED WITH FAMOUS CHASING ARROW SYMBOL- ONLY TWO OF THOSE CODES ONE AND TWO ARE COMMONLY RECYCLED IN L. A. COUNTY- ESPECIALLY WITHOUT THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS TO SUPPORT- THE- RECYCLING FOR THOSE OTHER PLASTICS. THEY NOW AND UP IN THE LANDFILL. SECOND REGARDLESS OF MATERIAL TYPE- NO RECOVERY FACILITIES SERVING L. A. COUNTY WAS FOUND TO CONSISTENTLY RECYCLE SINGLE USE FOODSERVICE WHERE SPECIFICALLY. AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF ISSUES INCLUDING. CONTAMINATION WITH FOOD RESIDUE AS WELL AS PRODUCT SIZE AND MATERIAL. SO IT YOU KNOW IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT RECYCLING IS REALLY A PHYSICAL PROCESS AND AS A RESULT PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS LIKE SIZE SHAPE COLOR WAIT. HOW CLEAN IT IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR THAT PROCESS TO WORK EFFECTIVELY. SO YOU KNOW AGAIN WITH THE KEY FINDINGS NOW LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES TO PLASTIC FOOD SERVICE WHERE. A REUSABLE UNSURPRISINGLY CAN HAVE IN A HIGHER INITIAL CAPITAL COST HOWEVER LONG TERM THEY'RE EXPECTED TO HAVE PRETTY CLEAR BENEFITS BOTH IN TERMS OF. THE ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMICALLY- COMPOSTABLE WHERE WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED- WELCOME POSSIBLE CAN BE BENEFICIAL FROM A LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE. AND IN SOME WAYS WOULD BE AN EASIER TRANSITION FOR SOME BUSINESSES AS COMPARED TO RE USABLE THE MATERIAL REALLY MATTERS. SO WHILE THERE ARE CERT FOR COMPOSTABLE MATERIALS AND CERTAINLY MANY PRODUCTS THAT LABEL THEMSELVES AS ECO FRIENDLY- THERE IS A REAL DISCONNECT BETWEEN THOSE LABELS AND MESSAGING AND HOW THE PROCESS ACTUALLY WORKS AT COMPOSTING FACILITIES AND SO. WHAT THE UCLA TEAM FOUND IS THAT THE CLEAREST BENEFITS REALLY CAME FROM A 100% FIBER BASED. PRODUCTS WITHOUT ANY CHEMICAL TREATMENTS. SO FINALLY THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MENTION IS ABOUT ECONOMIC IMPACT OF SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND ALTERNATIVES. FIRST LOOKING% AT THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE MADE IT SWITCHES TO- ALTERNATIVES OUT THERE ORDINANCES ORDINANCES AND SUCH. THE TEAM AGAIN CONFIRMED WHAT'S BEEN REPORTED WHICH IS THAT JURISDICTION'S REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY NEGATIVE AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO BUSINESSES- EITHER IN THE FORM OF BUSINESS CLOSURES OR EVEN APPLICATIONS FOR HARDSHIP WAIVERS. ON THE OTHER HAND. A COST IMPACT TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THE WASTE INDUSTRY RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE RECYCLING MARKET AND HAVING TO MANAGE SOME OF THESE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN SEVERE- WELL WE CERTAINLY CAN'T ATTRIBUTE ALL OF THOSE CHANGES TO SINGLE USE. PLASTIC FOODSERVICE WHERE ALONE- THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE SHIFT IN THE ECONOMIC CALCULUS OF RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN RECENT YEARS. WHILE RECYCLING WAS AT ONE TIME A RELIABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR JURISDICTIONS THOSE REVENUES OF EITHER AT DROPPED PRECIPITOUSLY OR IN SOME CASES PROGRAM SEVERAL ACTUALLY REQUIRED FUNDS FROM JURISDICTIONS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE. SO A QUICK EXAMPLE FROM THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THAT THE UCLA STUDY SITES. WHILE THE CITY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN RECEIVED ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE FROM ITS RECYCLING OPERATIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT WAS REDUCED TO JUST SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THIS IS SIGNIFICANT ND IT'S LIKELY TO GET WORSE- AND UNLESS SOMETHING IS DONE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT DIFFERENCE. IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SHOULDERED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND RATEPAYERS ULTIMATELY. ALL RIGHT NEXT SLIDE. SO THERE ARE OF COURSE A LOT INTERESTING POINTS IN THE STUDY AND IT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE FOR ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED. IN TAKING A LOOK BUT JUST TO CLOSE THE LOOP WITH THE MOTION- YOU KNOW WE WERE ON TRACK TO RELEASE A DRAFT IN APRIL- UNFORTUNATELY AS WE ALL KNOW THE- PANDEMIC HIT IN MARCH. AND AS OF NOW- YOU KNOW THEY'RE PARTICULARLY DEVASTATING IMPACT OF COURSE ON OUR LOCAL INTO. LOCAL RESTAURANT INDUSTRY- AND SO FOR NOW THE ORGANS DEVELOPMENT IS CURRENTLY ON HOLD. OKAY SAYS OUR NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THAT'S SAID- WE ARE THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD- THERE SOME KEY GAPS AND NEXT STEPS IDENTIFIED THROUGH. THE STUDY AND THERE ARE WORK THAT I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH AND SO. ONE THAT WAS THE NEED FOR CLEAR AND CONSISTENT DEFINITIONS AND STANDARDS FOR COMPOST ABILITY AND RECYCLABILITY- THESE DEFINITIONS REALLY NEED TO ALIGN WITH THE REALITY OF WASTE MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. AND FURTHER IT DOES HAVE BEEN DRIVE PRODUCT LABELING AND DESIGN YOU KNOW CONSUMERS AND HAVE TO BECOME EXPERTS IN MATERIAL SCIENCE TO KNOW WHAT BINS TO THROW THEIR FASHION- SECOND WELL IT IS. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING WORK. AS BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER THIS IS NOT GONNA SOLVE OUR LITTLE PART LITTER PROBLEM AS WELL AS SOME OF THE THER SECEDED ISSUES WITH PLASTIC PRODUCTION. AND OUR TOP PRIORITY REALLY NEEDS TO BE A REDUCING OVERALL PRODUCTION OF WASTE. BOTH THROUGH BETTER PRODUCT DESIGN AS WELL AS FINDING WAYS TO FACILITATE USE OF REUSABLE- FUNDING FOR INSTREAM INFRASTRUCTURE IS OF COURSE A HUGE NEED- NOT JUST FOR NEW FACILITIES BUT ALSO UPGRADED EQUIPMENT SUCH AS OPTICAL SORTERS A ROBOTIC SORTERS. AT EXISTING FACILITIES WHICH CAN REALLY IMPROVE- THE EFFICIENCY OF THE RECYCLING PROCESS- AND FINALLY AND THIS LAST ONE REALLY TIES INTO EVERYTHING ABOVE- THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE BETTER COLLABORATION WITH PRODUCERS- AND IN GENERAL JUST CONNECTING THAT CYCLE OF PRODUCTION WITH THE AND LIFE OF PRODUCTS. IT'S SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE TO ALLOW PRODUCERS TO CREATE PRODUCTS WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HOW THEY WILL BE MANAGED AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE. RIGHT NOW THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THE BURDEN OF MANAGING THESE PRODUCTS AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE IS NOW FALLING ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND ULTIMATELY RATE PAYERS. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU CAN STAND BY WE'LL HAVE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL DISCUSSION. NEXT WE HAVE JOHN KENNEDY FROM THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND HE IS HERE WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY CAN YOU HEAR ME- IS HE HE'S ON HIS MIGHT. OKAY YEAH I KNOW. ALL RIGHT. SO BEFORE I START WANT TO GIVE YOU A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF MY PRESENTATION TODAY. FIRST I WANT TO COVER WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE MANAGE SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLABLES. IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. NEXT FOCUS ON CHALLENGES WITH MANAGING PLASTIC WASTE AND LITTER AND RURAL CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THIRD FOCUS ON SOME RECOMMENDATIONS GOING FORWARD. SO ALL NOTE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE COST OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING THESE AREN'T JUST LOCAL GOVERNMENT COSTS BUT THESE ARE COSTS THAT ARE BORNE BY ALL RESIDENTS LIVING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS L. A. COUNTY JUST ALLUDED TO. SO TO BETTER UNDERSTAND SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT ROLE CALIFORNIA WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR JURISDICTIONS. WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN WITH- WORLD COUNTIES WITHIN RC RC STRETCHING FROM THE OREGON BORDER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MEXICO. WE RANGE IN POPULATION FROM A LOW OF ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED RESIDENTS IN ALCORN COUNTY. TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SONOMA COUNTY. NINETEEN OF OUR COUNTIES ARE UNDER SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND FIVE HAVE UNDER FOURTEEN THOUSAND SO WE'RE PRETTY SMALL IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS. SOME HAVE NO CITIES THREE HAVE NO CITIES AND EIGHT HAVE ONLY A SINGLE CITY. WE COVER LARGE AREAS AND HAVE VERY LOW POPULATION DENSITIES AND SO THAT CAN PRESENT CHALLENGES FOR SOLID WASTE COLLECTION- AND RECYCLABLE COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SOME VERY LOW MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES AND OUR COMMUNITY IS COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE WHICH IS ABOUT SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD THIRTEEN OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE A HOUSEHOLD INCOMES BELOW FIFTY THOUSAND PER YEAR. A HANDFUL ARE BELOW FORTY TWO THOUSAND YEAR. SO THIS IS ALL TO PAINT A PICTURE THE CALIFORNIA HAS MANY MANY MANY VERY DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES. BUT WE ALL SHARE SOME SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AND SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING. SO MOVING ON THURS THERE'S REALLY NO SINGLE WAY TO DISCUSS. DISCUSS OR DESCRIBE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT RECYCLING IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. SOME REAL JURISDICTIONS ARE SERVED BY FRANCHISE HAULERS THOSE FRANCHISE HAULERS MAY OR MAY NOT PROVIDE CURBSIDE COLLECTION SERVICES FOR SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING. A LOT OF AREAS DON'T HAVE CURBS AND- CAN'T REALLY USE CURBSIDE COLLECTION SERVICES SO SOME RURAL COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE OUTSIDE OF THE HIGHER DENSITY URBAN AREAS. MANAGE THEIR WASTE EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH SELF HAULING THAT MEANS THE RESIDENT WILL TAKE THEIR OWN TRASH AND RECYCLABLES. TO TRANSFER STATION OR LANDFILL- AND MANAGE THEIR WASTE THAT WAY. PLASTICS AND PLASTICS AND OTHER RECYCLABLES ARE SEPARATED BY THE RESIDENTS AND THOSE- SELF FALL JURISDICTIONS DROPPED OFF EITHER IN DESIGNATED AREAS OF THE TRANSFER STATION OR LANDFILL OR DROPPED OFF AT ANOTHER FACILITY ON THE WAY TO THE LANDFILL OR TRANSFER STATION. SO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WHEN IT COMES TO MANAGING PLASTIC WASTE THEIR MANY CHALLENGES THE BIGGEST ONE IS PROBABLY THE LACK OF END MARKETS FOR THOSE MATERIALS. IT OFTEN FEELS LIKE WE'RE ON A TWO LEGGED STOOL WE COLLECT MATERIALS AND WE SORT THEM BUT THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THEM TO GO ONCE WE'VE COLLECTED AND SORTED THEM. SO IF THEY'RE IN MARKETS WERE TYPICALLY PRETTY GOOD AT MINING THE WASTE STREAM TO FIND THOSE MATERIALS EXTRACT THEM AND RECYCLE THEM. WE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA SURE A LOT OF THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AND DIFFICULT TO MARKET- MATERIALS AS TO URBAN COLLEAGUES BUT THOSE PROBLEMS ARE OFTEN AND HANDS BECAUSE WE LACK THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT ARE FOUND IN URBAN AREAS. AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO TRANSPORT THOSE MATERIALS OVER GREATER DISTANCES PLASTICS ARE TYPICALLY LIGHTER WEIGHT- SO TAKES A LOT MORE VOLUME TO MOVE THEM AND SOME OF THE NEAREST MARKETS MAY ACTUALLY BE OUT OF STATE. GIVEN OUR BORDER COUNTIES. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF THE- MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE MATERIALS THAT WE FIND IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. THAT AREN'T- IS- THAT'S WONDERFUL IN SOME URBAN COMMUNITIES SO THERE ARE TWO CHALLENGES AND A SUCCESS STORY- THE FIRST CHALLENGE CONCERNS AGRICULTURAL PLASTICS. AND I WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN PRACTICE THIS DISCUSSION BY SAYING PLASTICS OFTEN SERVE IN A REALLY INTEGRAL ROLE IN AGRICULTURE BOTH IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION AND MARKETING. SO I'M NOT HERE TODAY TO. SUGGEST THAT WE PHASE OUT THE USE OF PLASTICS IN AGRICULTURE- BUT I THINK THIS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO INCREASE THE USE AND RECYCLABILITY OF THOSE MATERIALS THAT ARE USED IN THAT SECTOR. SOME LOCAL SOLID WASTE PROGRAMS HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL FILM THAT'S USED IN PRODUCTION. UNFORTUNATELY THERE AREN'T MANY MARKETS FOR THOSE MATERIALS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FEW MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE MATERIALS AND USE THEM TO PRODUCE NEW REUSABLE SHOPPING BAGS OR NEW AGRICULTURAL FILM. THOSE ARE ACTIVITIES WE SHOULD SUPPORT AND EXPAND GIVEN THE ROLE THE PLASTIC PLAYS AND PRODUCTION MARKETING. BECAUSE WITHOUT MARKETS THE MATERIAL GOES IN THE LANDFILL WORKING ACTUALLY REALLY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE IN THE LANDFILL ENVIRONMENT. SIMILAR PROBLEMS EXIST FOR PLASTIC IRRIGATION LINE. THAT OFTEN WINDS UP IN THE LANDFILL AND CAN POSE SIGNIFICANT. MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS TO. SOME OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE A LOT OF THESE MATERIALS COMING IN FROM CANNABIS GROWS A LOT FROM ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROWS AS WELL- IN TRINITY COUNTY THEY SHARED SOME EXAMPLES OF HELICOPTERS. BRINGING AND BALES- IRRIGATION LINE THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT OF FEDERAL FOREST LANDS. SO MOVING FROM THOSE MARINE DEBRIS IS A PROBLEM IN SOME OF OUR COASTAL AREAS THEY REPORTED PROBLEMS WITH ABANDONED PLASTIC FISHING GEAR INCLUDING NETTING BELIEVES CAGES. THEY'RE LARGELY PLASTIC BASE BUT THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THEM ONCE WE CAN PULL THEM OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO THEY'RE JUST GOING TO THE LANDFILL. BUT THE SUCCESS STORY IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING TO ME- IT CONCERNS PESTICIDE CONTAINERS. SB SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BY SENATOR MALDONADO REQUIRES PESTICIDE MANUFACTURERS TO PARTICIPATE IN RECYCLING PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT HDP PESTICIDE CONTAINERS ARE RECYCLED. LOCALS OFTEN COUNTIES WHOSE PERIODICAL ACTION EVENT AT WHICH THEY ACCEPT CERTIFIED TRIPLE RINSE PESTICIDE CONTAINERS THOSE ARE THEN SHIPPED ON SITE AND HOLD OFF TO BE RECYCLED. USUALLY MADE INTO FENCE POST PALETTE SPEED BUMPS MARINE PILINGS A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT REALLY HAVE VERY LITTLE IF ANY INTERFACE WITH THE GENERAL- CONSUMERS. SO THEY'RE SAFE USES. THE PROGRAM IS FUNDED BY MANUFACTURERS AND IT'S BEEN REALLY INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO KEEP A LARGE QUANTITIES PLASTICS OUT OF OUR LANDFILLS. AND TO SEE THEM RECYCLED IN THE NEWER PRODUCTS. AND GOING TO LITTER LIKE SOME OF OUR URBAN COLLEAGUES RURAL AREAS HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH LITTER. ROADSIDE LITTER WAS ONCE BOTTLES CANS AND PAPER BUT IT'S NOW MUCH MORE PLASTICS BASED INCLUDING FOOD PACKAGING. SINGLE USE BAGS BLOWING IN THE WIND CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN HIGH WIND AREAS ESPECIALLY MODEL COUNTY WE'VE HEARD- AND I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR MEMBERS AS SHIFT BACK TO PAPER BAGS OF YESTERDAY COULD HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS. ESPECIALLY WITH-RESPECT TO THE BAGS BLOWING IN THE WIND AND THE NOT TO GRADING IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND COULD ALSO ADDRESS SOME OTHER PROBLEMS WITH- THAT THE PAPER MARKET FIVE MARKET. AND LITTERING. CLEAN UP CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT AND COSTLY GOT A COUPLE EXAMPLES SISKIYOU COUNTY SO SPEND ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PINE. LARGE TRASH BAGS FOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO GO OUT AND PICK UP LITTER ALONG THE ROAD AND THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR A COMMUNITY OF ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS. AND THEN MODOC COUNTY TRIES TO HIRE INMATE CREWS WHERE THEY CAN. TO GO OUT AND CLEAN UP LATER. AND RELATED A LETTER. ONE OF THE LONGEST AND MOST PERSONAL EXPERIENCES MANY RESIDENTS WHO HAD WITH PLASTIC RECYCLING. IS THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED AND INTENDED TO COMBAT LITTERED BOTTLES AND CANS THAT HAVE NOW SHIFTED PREDOMINANTLY TO PLASTIC BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WOMEN ABOUT THEIR AND GLASS. ROGAN HAS GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RECYCLING BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND REDUCING LETTER. BUT UNFORTUNATELY MANY CONSUMERS EXPERIENCES REALLY SOURED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE OF THE WIDESPREAD LACK OF REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES. THIS HITS ESPECIALLY HARD IN RURAL AREAS. SOME COUNTIES HAVE NO REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES WHATSOEVER FOR THE RESIDENTS SO WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING MORE OF THOSE BOTTLES AND CANS. GOING TO THE LANDFILL WHERE BECOMES REALLY EXPENSIVE TRASH. AND SO THE REDEMPTION CENTER COLLAPSE REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY HAS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS BOTH IN RURAL AREAS. AND URBAN AREAS WHERE THE RATIO OF CENTERS TO POPULATION IS EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH. SO NEXT ALL TURN TO RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION PERHAPS THE STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE TO INCREASE MANUFACTURING GAUGE MINT. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH MEETING THE STATE SOLID WASTE DIVERSION RECYCLING REQUIREMENTS ALONE. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS YOU HEARD WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT ENDS UP IN- IN THE MARKET PLACE. WE NEED GREATER ENGAGEMENT BY PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT DESIGN AND THE USE OF RECYCLED PRODUCTS RECYCLED MATERIALS. FOR PRODUCT DESIGN MANUFACTURE SHOULD FOCUS ON DESIGNING PRODUCTS THAT ARE READILY RECYCLABLE NOT JUST THEORETICALLY RECYCLABLE AND FOR WHICH THERE ARE MARKETS THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AS WELL. HOMOGENIZATION OF PACKAGING MATERIALS COULD REDUCE CONTAMINATION AND MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO FIND MARKETS FOR THOSE CUTS. INCREASE IN THE USE OF RECYCLED MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS WILL INCREASE DEMAND FOR PLASTICS COMING OUT OF THE WAY SYSTEM. WE SHOULD FOCUS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON CREATION OF. INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT USE LESS MARKETABLE MATERIALS AND THAT ARE SCALABLE CALTRANS IS CURRENTLY USING SOME BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND PILOT PROJECTS FOR ROAD PAVING THAT'S REALLY INTRIGUING- BUT WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME COMPETITION FOR THOSE MATERIALS. AS BEVERAGE CONTAINER MANY FACTORS HAS TO USE THEM TO COMPLY WITH EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY THREE TEN FROM LAST YEAR SO THERE'S A QUESTION COULD CALTRANS USE OTHER TYPES OF RESINS. SOME OTHER LESS MARKETABLE MATERIALS FOR THOSE PROJECT. IS THAT BETTER THAN WHAT THEY'RE USING TODAY. AND THEN. THROUGH THE CREATION OF LOCAL AND DOMESTIC MARKETS- WE CAN HELP MAXIMIZE BENEFITS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THE ECONOMY AND JOB CREATION IN THE STATE SO RATHER THAN SHIPPING OUR WASTE OVERSEAS WHERE WE HOPE THAT IT GETS RECYCLED INTO SOMETHING ELSE LET'S FIND A WAY TO CREATE JOBS HERE. AND THEN FINALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BOTH FROM THE SUPERVISORS AND FROM THE RESIDENCE IS WE REALLY NEED AFFECTS FROM BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM WE NEED TO FIX THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THEIR ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMERS TO REDEEM THE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS TO GET THE DEPOSIT BACK FIVE SOME SOME TENCENT'S ADDS UP PRETTY QUICKLY. AND TO MAKE THE PROGRAM FLEXIBLE ENOUGH SO THEY CAN TIMELY RESPOND TO ANY CHALLENGES BOTH CHALLENGES ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU HAVE CLOSURES OF RECYCLING CENTERS AND ALSO MARKET CONDITIONS SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. IS SO WE HELLER WITH CAL RECYCLE. AS SHE'S IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCE FROM I BELIEVE. THANK YEAH WE CAN HEAR YOU AND WE CAN SEE YOUR POWER POINT. OKAY GREAT. ALL RIGHT SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FOR INVITING CAL RECYCLE TO SPEAK AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY. YOU FOR THE OTHER PRESENTERS TO AN EXCELLENT JOB OF FRAMING THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH PLASTICS ALL REINFORCE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TODAY. IN PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE REPRESENTING HELP RECYCLE DATA. PROGRAMS AND POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT PLASTICS ARE BRINGING TO OUR ENVIRONMENT INTO OUR ENTIRE MATERIALS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. OKAY NEXT SLIDE. AS YOU'VE HEARD PLASTICS GENERATION IS INCREASING AS WE MOVE TOWARD USING MORE SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING. THERE'S INCREASED COMPLEXITY OF PLASTIC PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET SUCH AS MULTILAYER MATERIALS FLEXIBLE POUCHES IN SHRINK SLEEVE LABELS. RESULTING IN MORE MATERIALS DISPOSED IN CONTAMINATION ISSUES IN THE RECYCLING STREAM. EFFORTS TO DATE WHETHER THROUGH MANDATORY OR VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO STOP PLASTIC FROM ENTERING CALIFORNIA'S WATERWAYS AND THE OCEAN. KARAKUL HAS GET ON PLASTIC DISPOSAL AND SOME DATE ON PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING FROM BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM RUSSIA SOME OF THAT IN HIS INTRODUCTORY PRESENTATION. AND WE HAVE SOME ANECDOTAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE INCREASE IN PLASTICS SUCH AS SINGLE USE PLASTIC FOOTWEAR ITEMS PP AND PLASTIC PACKAGING. MUCH OF THIS HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY COVERT NINETEEN. COVERS LIKE WILL HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL DATA ON RECYCLING FROM OUR NEW RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL REPORTING SYSTEM. HOWEVER ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE NEEDED FOR CAL RECYCLE TO OBTAIN A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF PLASTIC PRODUCTION AND RECYCLING IN THE STATE. YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THAT OF ALL THE PLASTIC WASTE GENERATED ONLY ABOUT 9% IS RECYCLED. 12% WAS INCINERATED IN THE- 79% THAT WAS LEFT WAS EITHER CUMULATED LANDFILLS OR SKIPPED INTO THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. CURRENTLY THE FORM OF PACKAGING. AND MOST OF THAT- IS DISPOSED WITHIN THE SAME YEAR THAT IT WAS BLACK. IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT PLASTIC IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE WASTE MANAGEMENT RECYCLING CHALLENGES THE STATE IS FACING BUT WE CAN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY FOCUSING ON PLASTIC ALONE. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON HOLISTIC SOLUTIONS FIRST REDUCING WASTE AND THEN INCREASED MANUFACTURE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE MATERIALS THAT THEY'RE BRINGING IT TO THE STATE. TO MAKE SURE WHICH GENERATED CAN BE MANAGED WITH IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE. SO YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS CHART PROCESS PRESENTATION BUT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AN IMPORTANT DATA POINT FROM THE SHARP. PLASTIC IS MAKINGUP 11% OF OUR DISPOSED WASTE STREAM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IN PLASTIC PACKAGING AND PACKAGING RELATED MATERIAL IN THE WASTE STREAM HAS INCREASED SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. BOTH THIS PROPORTION OF ALL MATERIALS AND TOTAL TONNAGE. THIS INCREASE IN PLASTIC PACKAGING IS SIGNIFICANT SINCE PLASTIC IS VERY LIGHT IT MEANS THAT GENERATION CONTINUES TO INCREASE AT A RATE THAT DOESN'T MATCH OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE. NEXT SLIDE. THIS GRAPH SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF MATERIAL ALL MATERIALS RECYCLED FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN SO THIS INCLUDES ON PLASTIC PAPER METALS FEDERA RECYCLING HAS BEEN DECREASING SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WHERE IT WAS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH OF 50% IN CALIFORNIA EIGHTY NINE THIRTY NINE SPURRED INVESTMENT IN STRONG COLLECTION AND SORTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE MASTER PROCESSING IS PRETTY GOOD FOR SOME MATERIALS LIKE P. T. NH TP BUT WEEK FOR OTHERS LIKE NEXT THREE THREE SEVEN PLASTICS WE TRADITIONALLY RELIED ON EXPORTS RECYCLING OF THOSE MATERIALS. IN CALIFORNIA WE COUNT EXPORTED RECYCLABLES AS RECYCLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EIGHTY NINE THIRTY NINE AND ALSO FOR WHEN WE ON CALCULATOR RECYCLING RIGHT. EXPORTED FRACTION OF OUR WASTE STREAM HAS HISTORICALLY ACCOUNTED FOR UP TO A THIRD OF ALL MATERIALS RECYCLED IN CALIFORNIA. WE CAN NO LONGER RELIANT EXPORTS REASONS I'LL GET INTO IN A FEW SLIDES AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO INCREASE GENERATION OF INCREASINGLY COMPLEX PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING. WITHOUT CORRESPONDING RECYCLING SOLUTIONS. NEXT SLIDE. AS MENTIONED CALIFORNIA HAS ROBUST COLLECTION SORTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS JOHN JUST DISCUSSED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS JURISDICTIONS. AND INDUSTRY HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THE STOCK INFRASTRUCTURE AND REMOVING RECYCLABLES THAT HAVE MARKET. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE FOCUSED ON REDUCING WASTE REDUCING CONTAMINATION INCREASING DIVERSION OF MATERIALS IN THE WASTE STREAM. HOWEVER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP PACE WITH THE COMPLEXITYOF PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING ENTERING CALIFORNIA MARKET ESPECIALLY PLASTIC PRODUCTS. NEXT SLIDE. MARKETS FOR RECYCLED PLASTICS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF STRICTER INTERNATIONAL POLICIES REGARDING IMPORT OF SCRAP OR RECYCLED MATERIAL. THESE INTERNATIONAL POLICIES ARE A GOOD THING. THANKS TO ENSURE THAT THE COUNTRIES WITH A PROVIDE UPON TO IMPORT OUR RECYCLABLES ARE NOT IMPORTING OUR GARBAGE WITH THOSE RECYCLABLES. MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE EXPORTING TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES WERE MATERIALS LIKE LOW VALUE THREE THREE SEVEN PLASTICS THAT DID NOT HAVE A MARKET DOMESTICALLY. WE HAVE NO WAY OF TRACKING IT AND HOW THOSE MATERIALS ARE RECYCLED. AND THEREFORE NO WAY KNOWING IF THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH OR SOCIAL CHALLENGES IN OTHER. CHINA HAS AN IMPENDING BAN ON ALL SOLID WASTE IMPORTS. AND CURRENTLY. INCLUDED IN THAT DEFINITION OF SOLID WASTE IS RECYCLED IS RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. CHINA WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY TO INTRODUCE RESTRICTIVE IMPORT POLICIES AND HAVE BEEN TIGHTENING THOSE POLICIES YEAR AFTER YEAR. MOST OF THE REDUCTION IN EXPORTS MATERIALS PARTICULARLY MIXED PLASTICS WAS DUE TO CHINA'S POLICIES. WE'VE STILL BEEN ABLE TO MOVE SOME MATERIAL TO CHINA BUT THAT MIGHT BE CHANGING WITH THIS IMPENDING BACK. SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN OTHER COUNTRIES ON. MAINLY IN SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH ASIA HAVE INTRODUCED SIMILAR POLICIES TO CHINA'S POLICIES. AND OF THE LAST MAJOR IMPENDING CHANGES THE BASEL CONVENTION AMENDMENTS ON MIXED PLASTICS PLEASE TAKE THESE TAKE PLACE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY ONES WHICH IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. THE DALLAS THE CONVENTION IS A MULTILATERAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENT IN TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT AGAINST THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF WASTE. THE GROUP OF COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SIGNED ON VOTED TO PLACE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON SCRAP PLASTICS PRIMARILY AFFECTING MIXED PLASTICS. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT ALLOWABLE PLASTICS CAN ONLY BE EXPORTED WHEN BOTH PARTIES HAVE GIVEN WRITTEN CONSENT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE US HAS NEVER RATIFIED THE CONVENTION. THE OTHER PARTY COUNTRIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TRADE WITH NON PARTY COUNTRIES EXCEPT UNDER BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL AGREEMENTS. SO WHAT DO THESE POLICIES MEAN. THERE ARE LESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA TO EXPORT RECYCLABLES. ESPECIALLY THOSE LIKE MIXED PLASTICS THAT HAVE QUESTIONABLE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THIS PROVIDES BOTH WITH THE CHALLENGE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THESE MATERIALS. AND PROCESS MORE MATERIALS DOMESTICALLY NEXT SLIDE. AS MENTIONED THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN BOTH EXPORTS OF HIGHER VALUE PLASTICS LIKE PT IN HD THAT'S THE FIRST CHART ON THE LEFT AS WELL AS LOWER VALLEY MIXED PLASTICS. AND THAT'S THE CHART ON THE RIGHT. THESE DECREASES ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF THE POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. ALL RIGHT NEXT SLIDE. KARAKUL HAS A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON PLASTICS ROSS DISCUSSED A FEW OF OUR KEY PROGRAMS LISTED HERE AND ALTHOUGH THESE PROGRAMS ARE IMPORTANT FOR REDUCING PLASTIC WASTE THE ONLY ADDRESS A NARROW PORTION OF THE PLASTICS GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE. SO NOW THA THESE PLASTICS ARE STAYING IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGE THEM HERE. FIRST CHALLENGES THAT THERE'S NO CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT IS GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING RECYCLED IN THE STATE. IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO EFFECTIVELY SORT THE MERIT OF PLASTICS. AND PLASTICS PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING THAT ENTER THE RECYCLING SYSTEM. PLASTIC MATERIAL QUALITIES INCONSISTENT COLLECTED CONTAMINATION IS AN ISSUE. BUT SO IS THE SHEER VARIETY OF MATERIALS. IN PRODUCTS SOMETIMES RECYCLERS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THIS TO SPECIFIC MATERIAL TO COLLECTOR BALAK MATERIAL. ANOTHER CHALLENGES AS OIL PRICES ARE LOW VIRGIN PLASTIC IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN RECYCLE PLASTIC DRIVING DOWN SCRAP VALUE OF RECYCLED PLASTIC. WITH THE NEW GLOBAL REQUIREMENTS REGARDING PLASTICS LIKE THE BALLOT THE CONVENTION CALIFORNIA WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO RELY. ON EXPORTS FOR RECYCLING. IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT TO MANAGE WHAT IS THE MEASURE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE NEEDED FOR CAL RECYCLE TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA ON THE GENERATION OF PLASTIC. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS THE FIRST IS ALWAYS THE FIRST PART REDUCE. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN WHICH GENERATION MEANS MORE STUFF TO MANAGE NEED TO WORKTOGETHER TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE PLASTIC PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING. WASTE ALSO CAN BE REDUCED YOUR PRODUCT AND PACKAGING DESIGN NOT ONLY THROUGH SOURCE REDUCTION BUT ALSO TO ENSURE WHAT IS BEING GENERATED CAN BE MANAGED TO OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SECOND OPTION IS THE SECOND ARE REDUCE THIS YEAR POWER CYCLE IS PILOTING A REDUCE GRANT PROGRAM. IN ADDITION COVERED NINETEEN HAS IMPACTED REUSABLE ALTERNATIVES TO DISPOSABLE PLASTIC PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING STATEWIDE. WE ARE STILL WASTING THIS TREND REVERSES PUBLIC HEALTH DATA IS SHOWING US HOW REUSABLE CAN BE SAFELY USED. NEXT WE NEED TO OPTIMIZE EXPAND INFRASTRUCTURE KEEP MATERIALS CLEAN CONTAMINATION CURBSIDE CREATES A CHALLENGE FOR DEVELOPING CLEAN BILLS OF MATERIAL LOW CONTAMINATION IS CRITICAL FOR RECYCLED MATERIAL TO BE MANUFACTURED INTO NEW PRODUCTS. HELLO CYCLES LAUNCHING A STATEWIDE PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO HELP EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ON RECYCLING RATE REDUCING CONTAMINATION. ANDREA HAD MENTIONED THAT BETTER EDUCATION ABOUT RECYCLING RIGHT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT INCLUDES BEING HONEST ABOUT WHAT ISN'T ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE. CHANGING INTERNATIONAL POLICIES INCREASING SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE PACKAGING PRODUCTS DEMONSTRATES THIS NEED FOR MORE IN STATE PROCESSING. DEVELOPING ROBUST RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA TO CREATE JOBS AND REDUCE CLIMATE IMPACTS MOVING US TOWARDS MORE OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. FOR RECYCLABLES THAT WE'RE STILL EXPORTING IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO IT RESPONSIBLY. POLICY HAS A ROLE IN SPRING MARKET DEVELOPMENT IN REDUCING PLASTIC WASTE TWO EXAMPLES OF THE PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM A MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT. A PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM PROVIDES MARKET INCENTIVES FOR PLASTIC RECYCLING THIS PROGRAM HAS TEN MILLION IN FUNDING TO SUPPORT PROCLAIMERS AND REMANUFACTURES FOR THE CLEANING IF USED TO RECYCLE PLASTIC IN CALIFORNIA. IN EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY THREE WHICH WAS JUST RECENTLY SIGNED REQUIRES BEVERAGE CONTAINERS BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS TO USE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS BY TWENTY THIRTY. WILL HELP SUPPORT THE MARKET FOR RECYCLED PLASTICS. THIS RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENT IS THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD. NEXT SLIDE. SOME OF WHAT'S AHEAD WILL HELP US GET CLOSER TO A SOLUTION. THE RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL REPORTING SYSTEM WILL GIVE US A BETTER PICTURE OF RECYCLABLE MATERIAL FLOWS IN CALIFORNIA BUT STILL WANT CAPTURE GENERATION OF PLASTIC PRODUCTS BEING SOLD INTO CALIFORNIA BUT IT'LL HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEING RECYCLED HERE. ORGANICS TO PROVISION TO SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WILL HELP REMOVE CONTAMINATION FROM THE PREVENT. R. S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE RANKS WILL BE FINALIZED BY THE END OF THE YEAR. IN THESE RACKS WILL DEFINE RECYCLABLE REUSABLE AND COMPOSTABLE FOODSERVICE PACKAGING IN STATE FACILITIES IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO DEFINE THESE TERMS. AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON WHAT IS ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE AND COMPOSTABLE IN THE STATE. THERE'S POTENTIAL THAT THESE DEFINITIONS COULD HAVE BROADER APPLICABILITY IF WE SEE PACKAGING LEGISLATION IN THE FUTURE. THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR LARGE SCALE REFORM. SO IN CLOSING EXPANSION OF RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE REGION. AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTE WE CREATE. WILL BE KEY IN REDUCING THE IMPACT OF PLASTICS IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER BUILDING MORE DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT SUFFICIENT BY ITSELF. MANY PLASTIC PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING CURRENTLY BEING SOLD IN THE STATE DESPITE CLAIMS OF RECYCLABLE AND REUSABLE- IN COMPOSTABLE AREN'T REALITY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE YOU CAN EVEN ACCESS CONTAMINANT WAS LIKELY PROCESS. A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS WHAT'S NEEDED ONE THAT REDUCES WASTE LOOKS UPSTREAM THAT PRODUCT DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPORTS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACTS THE PLASTIC GENERATION MANAGING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU AND THEN I THINK I'LL SEE IF MY- COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO THE OTHER PANELISTS. I MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WHETHER THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITHIN CAL EPA ACCORD NEED AT ALL ANY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO TACKLE THE PLASTIC POLLUTION THAT'S ALREADY IN THE ENVIRONMENT GOING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT PARTICULARLY THE WASTE TREATMENT IN WATER WASTE. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NEW EMERGING DATA ABOUT AIRBORNE PLASTIC POLLUTION SO MORNING IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL. YEAH STOURPORT WITHIN THE KELLY K. FAMILY ON A NUMBER OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLASTIC POLLUTION AND- ALSO THE ON- OPC AS WELL AS ON THEIR DEVELOPING. THAT LOOK MORE. PLASTICS ARE SKIPPING INTENT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT ON IS FAR AS THE URBAN AND OF CLASS ON. I NOT SURE BUT I WOULD CHIU BECAUSE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT EMERGING AREA IN WHICH WE NEED TO FOCUS IN. ON THANK YOU AND ALSO SEE IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS. FOR YOU BEFORE MOVED TO THE US TWO PANEL. IS GARCIA. YES THAT. THANK YOU I PAUL IF I'M A LITTLE. BUT OFTEN HE SAID AT THE TIME OF THE DAY SO FOR ME- I HAD A QUESTION- EARLIER ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE I. THE MONEY DOLLAR AT THAT WILL INDUSTRY IS. HAS BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TO CONVINCE US THAT WE CAN RECYCLE WAY OUT OF PROBLEM I EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T- AND THE FACT THAT IF WE KNOW THERE MOVING. OF THEIR BUSINESS INTO PRODUCING PETROCHEMICALS AND PLASTICS A SET OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THEM CONVENTIONALLY DO WE KNOW IF THEY ARE ALSO INVESTING IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE OF THIS. YEAH THERE ARE SOME INDUSTRY INITIATIVES RIGHT NOW. WHERE THERE ARE INVESTMENTS IN NON. IN MORE DOMESTIC RECYCLING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES- I DON'T KNOW THE- THE SCALE OF THAT. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW IMPACTFUL TO BE GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW IS. THERE'S ONLY 9% OF PLASTICS THAT ARE ACTUALLY BEING RECYCLED GLOBALLY SO ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THIS INVESTMENTS AND SOME ON INDUSTRY. IT'S HARD TO KNOW. HOW FAR THEY'LL GO IN MAKING THIS. DENT IN THE CHALLENGES WITH RECYCLING PLASTICS. AND THEN WHEN YOU- AND TO BE THIS NEED TO TALK ABOUT WE USED TO. A LOT OF THIS MATERIAL FOR. AND WE'RE NOT ANYMORE BUT WITH IT BEING RECYCLING IT WAS BEING EXPORTED. AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE JUST DON'T KNOW WE KNOW THAT SOME OF IT WAS- BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- WHAT WERE EXPORTING FAILS OF- SINGLE MATERIALS TO LIKE ADJUSTED PTB THAT'S RELATIVELY CLEAN OR JUST EACH DETAIL. AND THAT'S GENERALLY GETTING RECYCLED THE CHALLENGES AND THE MIXED PLASTIC BALES THOSE BALES OF PLASTICS THREE THROUGH SEVEN WORKS HARD TO SAY WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THOSE WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES PUBLIC PROBABLY NUMBER FIVE IS PULLED OUT OF THOSE. AND RECYCLED BUT SOME OF THOSE OTHER PLASTICS WE JUST DON'T KNOW. WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO THEM ONCE THEY'RE EXPORTED. COUNTRIES AND THEN FINALLY I YOU'VE BEEN. TRACKING MORE DATA. ON AND IN THIS. OUR WE- DO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF LIKE EQUITY TOOLS THAT WOULD HELP PRIORITIZE COMMUNITIES OF COLORS OR REAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE- ACTED IN AN DIFFERENT WAYS IN INEXORABLY I TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE. ALLOCATING DOLLARS TO RESOURCES THAT WE DID IT IN AN EQUITABLE WAY. HE ALSO WON THE ALSO ARE RELY ON- AND VIRUS FREE. S. ON A TOOL FOR WEB WHERE ON AWARDING ACROSS SO WE- GIVE OUR- GRANT YOU THE OPERA HOUSE GAS WE DON'T FUND FOR INTEREST IN THIS. AND WE HAVE A FIBER PLASTIC IN LAST GRANT WHICH- WE INVEST IN IN. TO WORST THOSE- AND WE USE COUNT SCREEN ON TO HELP US I DON'T. YES AND WHICH TO. INVEST THOSE THOSE- THOSE FRIENDS BUT AS YOU GET MY- THERE ARE ON IN BURMA JUSTICE CONCERN ABOUT OFFICE SO IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT AS WERE THINKING ABOUT IF YOU INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA IF WE WANTED TO BUT STILL- DEVELOP MORE DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROCESS RECYCLED. THAT WE'RE DOING IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE AN AND TO COMMUNITIES- AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE USING SCREEN AS OUR AS OUR SCREEN TOOL TO IDENTIFY THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE AND I'M MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH ON THE LOCAL CITING OF THESE FACILITIES TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A ORDINATED APPROACH WHEN THESE FACILITIES ARE GETTING CITED. THANK YOU. MR MCCARTY. SURE I HAVE TO GO. FOR CAL RECYCLE. ONE ON THAT CHART THAT YOU SHOWED ABOUT RECYCLING RATES THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO. I DON'T. WELL FIRST OF ALL THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION AND NONE OF THIS NEWS IS THIS UPLIFTING IS KIND OF YOU KNOW DEPRESSING FROM ALL PERSPECTIVES THE- ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THE HEALTH IMPACT AND THAT JUST THE PRACTICAL IMPACT A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO FOUR SO. THE FIRST QUESTION THIS PIECE IS- IS THAT DO YOU FOLKS FROM THE RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE THINK WAS MORE AS- KIDS. MORE TOP THERE WE'RE USING. OR THE MARKET ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW CHINA AND SO FORTH ARE NOT TAKING- YOU KNOW THE- THE CONT ESPECIALLY PLAST. AND OVERALL RECYCLING IS A BIGGER PICTURE TAX WE A HEARING ANOTHER THIS WEEK WITH IS FOR CLASS IS THAT IS ARE THEY EACH OR ONE MORE THAN THE OTHER. YOUR A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND- I HAVE A OF CHART THAT OFTEN SHOW PRESENTATIONS THAT. THAT SO THE RELAY. BETWEEN ON WAGES AND- GENERATION OF THE- AND WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GOOD WE GENERATE MORE STUFF. AND UP UNTIL PREVIOUSLY THE ECONOMY HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD SO WE ARE GENERATING A LOT MORE THINGS- ON. AND A LOT OF THESE THINGS DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE. PLACES FOR THEM TO GO TO GET RECYCLED SO MUCH OF THAT WAS DUE TO- THESE INTERNATIONAL POLICIES BUT ALSO DUE TO JUST THE SHEER AMOUNT OF THE SHEER VOLUME OF MATERIAL GOING INTO THE SYSTEM. AND THEN- BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME THAT'S GOING INTO THE BLUE BINS WE SEE A LOT OF THIS CONTAMINATION. WHICH MAKES THIS MATERIAL EVEN HARDER TO RECYCLE SO I THINK TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S REALLY A COMBINATION OF THESE THINGS. WE'RE GENERATING POLICIES ARE COMING DOWN AS- THE INTERNATIONAL RECYCLING COMMUNITY IS GETTING CLEANED UP AND- WE'RE JUST SEEING THAT TRANSLATE INTO. YOU KNOW THE REALITY OF LOW RECYCLING RATES AS WORK JUST GENERATING MORE DISPOSING MORE. SO IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE. THANK YOU AND SO THAT LEADS. TO MY TO MY SECOND QUESTION SO. SIR WE CAN TALK ABOUT- MANUFACTURERS AND- THAT ARE MAKING THE PACKAGING AND THE- GOODS BUT IT'S ON US BECAUSE WE'RE BUYING ALL THAT STUFF SO IT'S A TWO PART SOLUTION A TWO PART ISSUE THEY'RE LOOKING I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM. AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT IF YOU HAD THE INDUSTRY FOLKS IN HERE RIGHT BEFORE US TODAY THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A BIG ISSUE- YOU KNOW THAT. THAT THAT THERE IS A- NO WIN SITUATION FOR THAT FOR THEM RIGHT NOW AS WELL. I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT THEM OFF THE HOOK BUT- ARE ARE THERE ANY REALISTIC- FRANK SIDES FAR AS- YOU KNOW WHAT. AMAZON IS DOING OR WHAT YOU KNOW INDUSTRY IS DOING ON THE ON THE SINGLE USE PLASTICS YOU KNOW WITH DIFFERENT MATERIALS THAT ARE COMPOSTABLE I KNOW YOU CAN. DO WE CAN- SQUABBLE OVER WHAT THE DEFINITION OF TRULY COMPOSTABLE SO. THE OTHER IS THERE ANY YEAH IT DOES SOLUTIONS ON ON THE HORIZON THAT WE COULD HAVE ANY OPTIMISM ABOUT THIS BESIDES LOOKING AT OUR- DEMAND PERSPECTIVE. YEAH IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND- CAL RECYCLE NEED WITH INDUSTRY PARTNERS ALL THE TIME AND THERE'S A LOT OF. US ON REALLY GREAT AFTER COMING FROM INDUSTRY FROM RECYCLED CONTENT GOALS TO ACTUAL RECYCLABILITY GOALS AND- YOU KNOW PACKAGING DESIGNERS AND PRODUCT DESIGNERS THAT ARE THINKING MORE ABOUT END OF LIFE PRODUCTS. BUT AS WE'RE SEEING FROM THE DATA THAT THAT I'VE SHOWN THAT RUSH HAS SHOWN THE NUMBER THE OTHER SPEAKERS. SHOWN IS THAT WE'RE JUST NOT SEEING THE NEEDLE MOVE YET SO- THESE ARE ALL GREAT AMBITIOUS GOALS BUT WE REALLY NEED THE ROBERT HALF THE ROAD. TO REALIZE THAT THE CHANGES THAT COULD BE ACCOMPANIED WITH THOSE AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL GET THERE BY INDUSTRY INITIATIVES ALONE IT SEEMS SUPPORTIVE POLICIES GOING TO BE. VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR HELPING US. REACH THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE BY TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PER EIGHTY THREE FORTY ONE RECYCLE 75% OF ALL MATERIAL WE'RE GENERATING IN THE STATE AND- AT 37% AND TWENTY NINETEEN WERE FAR FROM THAT SO. IT'S GOING TO TAKE- COMMITMENT BY INDUSTRY- AS WELL AS SUPPORT OF POLICIES FOR US TO REALLY. GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO BUT YES INDUSTRIES DOING QUITE A BIT YEAH I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS THAT WELL FIRST OF ALL. I DON'T- SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT WE CAN LIVE IT'S ALL INDUSTRY THEY'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM I THINK. TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO AS WE SAID EARLIER THEY SET UP. JUST RECYCLE EVERYTHING'S GOOD POINT THEY A BLUE PANTS UP THAT'S NOT WORKING SO CLEARLY WE HAVE A WALL. AND FEDERAL POLICY AND STATE POLICY BUT I GUESS I GUESS I'M WHAT I'M WHAT I'M WONDERING IS. YOU KNOW ARE THERE IT SEEMS THAT SOMEBODY IF THEY CAME UP WITH THE PRODUCTS AND I MENTIONED THIS THE OTHER DAY AND I'M I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S ACCURATE BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE PUTTING PEOPLE TO THE- TO THE- YOU KNOW. HAD A SPACER. ON ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE YOU THINK THAT SOMEBODY WOULD COME UP WITH SOME. BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCT AND THEY COULD JUST. MAKE OUT YOU KNOW TURN ON THE UPSIDE ECONOMIC OF THAT SO. IS THERE ANYTHING I THERE IN THE- THAT HAS AN ALTERNATIVE. TO PLASTIC THAT WE THINK IS A- IT'S HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER GIVE ON. THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENT. THAT ARE BEING INTRODUCED RIGHT NOW SO ON YOU KNOW SOME INDUSTRY INITIATIVES ARE MOVING FROM PLASTIC TO FIBER. BUT THERE'S CHALLENGES WITH THE FIBER RECYCLING MARKET TO- YOU KNOW COMPOSED ABILITY IN FACT WOULD DEGRADE ABILITY. ARE ARE CHALLENGING IN HOW THEY ACTUALLY BEHAVE IN THESE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS AND IF THEY'RE SORTED CORRECTLY AND ARE WASTE INFRASTRUCTURE SO ALL THAT TO SAY IS THAT- INNOVATION IS HAPPENING AND IT'S EXCITING BUT- THERE ISN'T A SILVER BULLET TO GET US THERE I MEAN REALLY WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS IS ON. WASTE REDUCTION AND THEN IDENTIFYING WITH INNOVATION HOW THAT FITS INTO OUR EXISTING SYSTEM OR IF THERE ARE GOING TO BE NEW SYSTEMS WHAT BEHAVIOR CHANGE LOOKS LIKE ON THE CONSUMER SIDE. TO MAKE SURE THOSE GET MATERIALS ARE GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE BECAUSE THEY WON'T BEHAVE CREEK CRACKLY IN OUR SYSTEMS. IF THEY'RE GOING TO THE WRONG PLACE SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW COMBUSTIBLE PLASTICS ARE ARE INNOVATIVE AND EXCITING BUT IF THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY. GOING TO COMPOST AND WILL THEY CONTAMINATE PLASTIC RECYCLING STREAM SO IT'S- IT'S A SYSTEMATIC- CHALLENGE BUT I THINK THAT- WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF HARMONIZING. THESE. MATERIALS THAT ARE COMING IN WITH. I MERGING TECH. TO US THERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR- BOTH- MR KENNEDY AND MR AND MS- CONVALESCE AND EITHER ONE OR BOTH OR NEITHER OF YOU ARE WELCOME TO ANSWER THESE ARE KIND OF JUST. KIND OF THROWN OUT THERE FOR YOU- THE FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE MONETARY IMPACTS OF DEALING WITH PLASTIC POLLUTION ON LOCALITIES AND ON COUNTIES. AND I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT IN EACH COUNTY. BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY GENERAL IDEAS OF WHAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT IS ON. MUNICIPALITIES AND HOW THEY PAY FOR IT HOW DO THEY DEAL WITH THOSE IMPACTS. WHOEVER HE WANTS TO JUST TO START. OR NOT IT'S FINE TO. I MEAN ALL ALL TAKE A FIRST STAB- UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TODAY SO I CAN TRY AND DO SOME RESEARCH- I GOT SOME ANECDOTAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW WE'RE HELPING TO FACILITATE SOME OF THE ORGANIC- GRASSROOTS CLEAN UP EFFORTS THAT EXIST OUT THERE AND SOME OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES- WE'RE SEEING IT FOR JUST NORMAL LATER ONE OF THE ENCOURAGING THINGS WAS I. I HEARD ABOUT IT- FOR RECREATIONAL FISHERS AS WELL WHERE FISHING LINES ARE OUT THERE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATERWAYS- AND THEY'RE BEING TAKEN CARE OF BY FISHERS OUT THERE TOO SO I CAN GO BACK AND TRY AND FIND OUT HOW MUCH WE'RE DEVOTING TO THOSE I KNOW WE DO RECEIVE SOME- VERY VERY VERY MODEST FUNDING FROM THE STATE THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS. TO HELP FACILITATE SOME OF THOSE GOALS BUT IT'S NOWHERE NEAR WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR THOSE OBJECTIVES RIGHT AND THERE'S THE COSTS OF LITTER THEN THERE'S ALSO THE COST OF THE LANDFILLS THEMSELVES SURE RIGHT AND I CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AS WELL I MEAN ALL THOSE COSTS ARE BASICALLY PASSED ON TO RATEPAYERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES- EITHER THROUGH THE GATE FEES OR- YOU KNOW THERE ARE VERY BILLING MECHANISMS THAT ARE USED IN THE TOURISTIC. RIGHT BECAUSE SOMETIMES SOMETHING HEAR FROM. QUITE A BIT YEAH GONNA I'M GONNA GO TO THIS- MISS AND- OF THE THAT. YOU KNOW IF FOR THEIR REGULATED MORE HIGHLY THERE ASK TO SWITCH. A MORE EXPENSIVE MATERIAL OR TO DO MORE STEWARDSHIP THAT THEY'LL BE COSTS THAT ARE PASSED ALONG TO CONSUMERS. AS THOUGH THEY'RE NOT ALREADY BEARING THOSE COSTS IN THE CASE OF CONSUMERS THEY HAVE THE CHOICE. OF WHETHER TO BUY A PRODUCT OR NOT. BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COSTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITH THE MEDICATION TO DEAL WITH THAT. THE POLLUTION CLEAN UP THE LANDFILLS THAT SPREAD ACROSS EVERY SINGLE RESIDENT OF A COMMUNITY WHETHER THEY BUY PLASTIC PRODUCTS ARE NOT. SO WHAT ABOUT THE CASE OF L. A. COUNTY WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE COSTS ARE AND ARE THEY INCREASING OR DECREASING AND HOW MUCH OR- HOW MUCH IS AN ORDINARY PERSON PAYING TOWARDS THIS PROBLEM. YES ALL ALL THAT JUST KIND OF ECHO I DON'T HAVE EXACT NUMBERS ANY BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP TO FIND SOME MORE SPECIFICS- I THINK. YOU KNOW I CITED ONE STUDY THAT SHOWED- IMPACTS ON THE ORDER OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR SAN DIEGO AND I THINK THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF OUR LARGER CITIES IN THE COUNTY- THAT BUT YOU KNOW IT IS. IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW ISSUE WHEN IT'S IN FLUX SO I THINK WE'RE STILL KIND OF WAITING TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE AND ON REPAIRS I WOULD JUST ECHO THAT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING ASIDE FROM- EITHER THE JURISDICTION OR THE RATE PAYERS AT THIS POINT SO THOSE WILL FALL ON. RESIDENTS ULTIMATELY WHAT MIGHT I SUGGEST THAT. AS YOU DO YOUR UTILITY BILLS AND YOU HAVE YOUR FEES. BUT IF YOU FOUND A WAY TO SPIT OUT. A PLASTIC DISPOSAL MITIGATION FEE ON THAT BILL. THAT THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER REASON WHY RESIDENTS WOULD SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THIS UNDER CONTROL. AND TRULY UNDERSTAND. THE COSTS OF THOSE CHEAP. DOLLAR STORE. TOYS IN PRAGUE. THAT ARE SINGLE USE OR THAT ARE CEAPLY MADE AND- BECOME ESSENTIALLY SINGLE USE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HUGE COST- DOWN THE ROAD TO THOSE VERY SAME PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM CAN NOT AFFORD IT STILL BE GREAT JUST FIND A WAY TO. PARSE THAT OUT. ON A BILL SOMEWHERE MAYBE THAT'S AN IDEA FOR LEGISLATION. AND IT MIGHT MY NEXT QUESTION IS- I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT WHAT- WHAT ACTIONS THAT YOU'VE- BEEN ABLE TO TAKE HAVE BEEN THE MOST AFFECTED- IF ANY IN DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES. AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO NO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT'S FINE TOO YEAH JUST JUST GO AHEAD. I MEAN ECHOING WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID AND I WENT IS SO WE FROM CALORIE CYCLE THAT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY FOUND THE SOLUTION TO THE ISSUES- I JUST ECHO AGAIN YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD ENORMOUS SUCCESS WITH WAS THE PLASTIC BAG BAN- AND THAT WAS- SORT OF A COMBINATION OF POLICY DRIVING. BEHAVIOR CHANGE WHICH AND DISH AND HAS- YOU KNOW DRIVEN- INDUSTRY TO SORT OF ADJUST SO- THAT WAS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL I THINK THERE WAS THE FIRST YEAR AFTER THAT WAS PASSED. THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE OVER 90% REDUCTION IN- OBSERVE A LITTER OF PLASTIC BAGS SO- I THINK IT DOES SHOW THAT POLICIES AIMED AROUND SOURCE REDUCTION- CAN REALLY. CAN REALLY- IMPACT THESE THINGS. AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU TRY TO ENACT POLICIES LIKE PLASTIC BAG BAN OR ANY OTHER POLICIES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. THIS IS FOR EITHER OF YOU. WELL I'D LIKE TO STEP BACK JUST A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK- THE SO. WITH YOUR YOUR PROMPT ABOUT- PUTTING A FEE ON RESIDENTS OF BILLS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO SHOW THE COST OF RECYCLING I KNOW THERE ARE SOME JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE STARTED DOING THAT- SOME JURISDICTIONS AS THE RENEGOTIATING THEIR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS- THERE COST. INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH NATIONAL SWORD. WE'RE RECYCLING IS L. A. COUNTY AND POWER CYCLE POINTED OUT USED TO BRING IN MONIES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- NOW IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING TO SUBSIDIZE THOSE EFFORTS TO THE RATEPAYERS. SO WE'RE SEEING MORE ON BILL. FLAGS THAT THAT EXISTS- AND RECYCLING FEES ARE BEING IMPOSED- FOR SOME MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE PRODUCTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGHER GATE FEES FOR THOSE MATERIALS- OR TIPPING FEE- AND- AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW. WHAT WORKS WE WERE REALLY HOPEFUL FOR LAST YEAR'S SOLUTION SB THIRTY FOUR EIGHTY TEN EIGHTY- TO CREATE. SHE PARTNER WITH ME FOR. SO THAT WE CAN REALLY HAVE EVERYONE HAVING TO SIT AT THE TABLE TO DEAL WITH PLASTIC WASTE AND RECYCLING. AND RECYCLABILITY ESPECIALLY. THANK THANK YOU CAL DO YOU HAVE ANY COME AOUT BARRIERS TO HAVE OR AND I PAUL. YEAH I MEAN IT JUST AGAIN LOOKING AT SORT OF THE FOOD SERVICE WARE ORDINANCE I ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS ARE THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS- SO IT'S HI THERE THERE IS JUST AND THERE IS STILL- A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT WILL BE AND- EVEN THOUGH WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN ANY- NEGATIVE IMPACTS- FROM- AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES- AND- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE HAVE. WE DEFINITELY GET PUSHBACK FROM THE INDUSTRY AS WELL- I'M LOOKING AT THESE THINGS VERY SIMILAR AG COMMENTS THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE- STATED IN TERMS OF- THAT COSTS AND HOW THOSE COSTS WILL IMPACT CONSUMERS AS WELL- LIKE I MENTIONED THE STUDY THAT WE HAD UCLA DID REALLY KIND OF- YOU KNOW TOOK APART SOME OF THOSE ARGUMENTS AND MADE US FEEL THAT THEY WERE AND- WE'RE TO ISSUE AND ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT AGAIN AS YOU MENTIONED- CHIU FRIEDMAN THAT- THESE COSTS ARE BEING BORNE BY SOMEONE- IT'S MAYBE NOT AS OBVIOUS TO EVERYBODY- BUT BUT THEY STILL EXIST YOU CAN AVOID THAT SO- BUT YES OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT- COST TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. AND MY LAST QUESTION IS A LOT OF TIMES THE STATE COMES IN AND SORT OF PREAMPS THE LOCALS BY MAYBE DOING A STATEWIDE PLASTIC BAG BAN OR OTHER TYPE POLICIES THAT MAYBE RESTRICT OR OVERRIDE SOME OF THE LOCAL REGULATIONS- IS THAT IS THAT HELPFUL OR IS IT WOULD YOU RATHER THAT WE COMPLETELY STAY OUT OF THE TRASH BUSINESS OR IS IT HELP WHEN WE COME IN AND TRY TO DO- MORE REGULATIONS ON INDUSTRY OR- I'M WE DISPARITIES I KNOW THAT'S A REALLY BROAD QUESTIONS MAYBE YOU CAN JUST GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHEN IT'S HELPED WHEN IT'S HURT THAT KIND OF THING. AND BY THE WAY HELPED HER DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM YOU. KNOW A PLASTICS UNDERGOING. CONTROL COSTS- THAT KIND OF THING. I MEAN WHEN YOU HAVE SOME LIKE A BOTTLE. I THINK IT'S THE TO HELP THE THIS IS THE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE THE SMALL SCALE THE LOCAL LEVEL- IT HELPS TO A MARKET FOR THOSE MATERIALS AND GETTING. OUT THERE- AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STRONGLY BRISTLED AT THE NOTION OF PREEMPTION- AND RESTRICTING THE ABILITY FOR LOCALS TO COME IN AND ADOPT ORDINANCES THAT MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE BEFORE DIFFERENT AND WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME CHALLENGES THIS LAST YEAR WITH- WORKED THIS YEAR. WITH CODED IN THE PLASTIC BAG BANS- BECAUSE THERE WAS A DIFFERENT TREATMENT AMONG BE GRANDFATHERED- MUNICIPALITIES THAN AMONG THOSE MUNICIPALITIES THAT WERE GRANDFATHERED IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER- AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR LOCALS. TO GRAPPLE WITH. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. YEAH GO AHEAD. MMHM OKAY- YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW OF COURSE CALIFORNIA'S INCREDIBLY DIVERSE STATE AND- L. A. COUNTY STATE FACES VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES JUST AS I AM AN EXTREMELY LARGE- COUNTY- SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE GENERALLY NOT SUPPORTIVE OF STRICT- PREEMPTION CLAUSE IS- WE LIKE TO AT LEAST HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO- YOU KNOW DESIGN SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR COMMUNITIES- AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE WE ARE ALSO HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE OF A LOT OF THESE ISSUES BEING DEALT WITH ON A STATE WIDE- ISSUE AS LONG AS THEY ALLOW FOR SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY- YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE. OF COURSE JOHN MENTIONED THE BOTTLE BILL THAT ALSO- POLICIES LIKE AND- YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE A PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY- AS WELL AS- LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES THAT LIKE SB FIFTY FOUR IN TEN EIGHTY TEN EIGHTY WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH- LOOKING AT PACKAGING LIMITATIONS AND MATERIAL DESIGN ARE REALLY THINGS THAT WE CAN'T. DEAL WITH ON A LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT ARE REALLY BETTER I DEALT WITH ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL- WHERE YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN SORT OF COME UP WITH THE JOINT SOLUTION AND- HAVE ENOUGH OF A AT THAT ECONOMY OF SCALE WHERE- THAT IMPACT REALLY REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE SO- YES WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY SUPPORTIVE OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES HAPPENING ON- A STATE WIDE LEVEL THANK YOU THAT'S THE ONLY QUESTIONS I HAVE MS GARCIA ANY QUESTIONS. I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF OUR PANELISTS ACTUALLY ALL THREE OF OUR PANELISTS AND ALLTHE PANELS THAT WE HAD TODAY THIS WAS VERY VERY HELPFUL AND WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO PUBLIC- COMMENT IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO- TO COMMENT- THERE'S TWO MINUTES A PERSON ANYBODY. OKAY THEN WE'LL GO TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE BY PHONE A MODERATOR IF YOU CAN QUEUE UP THROUGH THE SPEAKERS AND. BRING THE FIRST SPEAKER IN. THANK TWO MINUTES OF. OPERATOR ARE YOU THERE AND- YES YOU HEAR ME YES I CAN THANK YOU OKAY. AND WE NEED TO ABOUT THREE AND QUEUE BE A MALL. AND AGAIN A ONE THEN. IF YOU HAVE A COMMON. OKAY WE'RE GOING TO BE A DISTRICT MAINTAINING THE TO. RULE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. FOR OPERATE. THANK AND THAT'S THE ONE THEN THERE'LL BE JUST A MOMENT FOR HER FIRST Vì AFTER IN THE QUEUE JUST A MOMENT PLEASE. BECAUSE WE KNOW. AND WILL FIRST GO LINE NUMBER THREE CALL. I NEED TO THREE YEAR OF THE- YOU MAY BE NEEDED AT EACH. KEPLINGER FREEMEN CHEN REGARDING MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE OUT OF REGULAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- WE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF PLASTIC POLLUTION TO OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AS WELL TO MAKE CLEAR CAL CHAMBER AND ITS MEMBERS SHARE THE GOAL OF REDUCING PLASTIC POLLUTION INCREASING RECYCLING RATES AND SOURCE REDUCING RAW MATERIAL. TO THAT END I WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO DEVELOP A STATE WIDE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. BURKE I THINK EVERYONE IN IN IT ISSUE. A THAT POLITICS WILL. MUST BE. BEYOND BORDERS TO TRULY AN AND- ON POLLUTION IN THE MARINA. SECOND I THINK MENU GET HIT A THAT- I THINK IT'S REALLY AND- BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A STATE OF PRO OR THE- PRO. IF CALIFORNIA IS WORK TOWARDS CREATE OF THE STATE WIDE CIRCULAR A- THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE DISCUSSED ABOUT HOW TO SPIN. THE STATE APPROACH TO COMPLEMENT THE STATE WIDE MANDATE. IT IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE INDUSTRY WITH THE COMPLIANCE PATHWAY AT THE CURRENT PATCHWORK OF RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. CANNOT CO EXIST WITH A STATEWIDE CIRCULAR. WITH STATEWIDE MANDATE THE REGULATED COMMUNITY CAN DESIGN FOR STATEWIDE RECYCLABILITY REQUIREMENTS BUT IT CANNOT DESIGN AND INVEST IN A COUNTY BY COUNTY APPROACH. SIMILARLY AS NOTED EARLIER THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS ARE CRITICAL TO MAKING THIS WORK. AND WE AGREE THAT SHIPPING MATERIALS OVERSEAS IS NOT A POLLUTION. AND WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR CURRENT RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING SYSTEM PROVIDE WELL PAYING JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT COMPANIES CANNOT AND WILL NOT DO THAT BILLION IT'S NECESSARY TO DO THAT. IF THEY'RE NOT CLEAR ON WHAT THE STATE WIDE REQUIREMENTS ARE GOING TO BE IF JURISDICTION BY JURISDICTION CAN DO DIFFERENT THINGS. AND ALL ALL ALL LEAVE IT HERE ON ONE POSITIVE NOTE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IT KNOWLEDGE IS THERE'S A PARADIGM SHIFT UNDER WAY TO BUILD A BETTER RECYCLING AND COMPOST. IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WE'RE WORKING- AS WE HAVE THE LAST TWO YEARS TO REALLY WORK ON INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY BUILD OUT THE AND MARK AND I'LL LEAVE IT THERE THINK SO MUCH.

THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR EXPERTISE AND THEIR EXPERIENCES. UP FOR MY- PERSPECTIVE IS SOMEONE WHO COMES OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS WELL AS NO LEGISLATOR I THINK THE PUBLIC REALLY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL AND- TRUE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THIS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PRODUCT- BEING PLASTIC. AND WE HAVE BEEN SOLD A REAL BILL OF GOODS THAT RECYCLING IS- THE- SOLUTION AND THAT IF THERE IS PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN IT'S BECAUSE OF CONSUMERS OR- OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LITTERING. AND TRULY IT'S- A SYSTEM THAT JUST WAS NEVER SET UP TO DEAL WITH WITH. A PRODUCT THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO RECYCLE AND EXPENSIVE. AND THE SOLUTION IS TO. TO FIND WAYS OF REDUCING IT. AND WE HAVE TO DEVELOP THE POLITICAL WILL. TO DO THAT AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE I THINK THE PUBLIC REALLY UNDERSTANDING THOSE IMPACTS AND THEY'RE BEGINNING TO I THINK OUR CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS AT THIS POINT A LOT MORE THAN THEIR PARENTS DO. AB BUT IT'S UP TO US TO BE THE PARENTS IN THE ADULT IN THE ROOM AS WELL. AND TO BECAUSE MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA SETS THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT BEING THAT OF WOULD GOOD STEWARDSHIP IS. SO I HOPE THAT- WE ALL CAN WORK THIS YEAR. TOWARDS SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL. I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF REALLY COMMITTED AND VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE MEMBERS- UP HERE ON THE DYESS AND THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATURE. AND I. I'VE I FEEL A- VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW GET TOGETHER AND REALLY DO SOMETHING SO THANKS FOR BEING HERE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION THANKS TO STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND WE'LL SEE YOU ALL ON WEDNESDAY.
