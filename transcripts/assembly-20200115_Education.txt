SENDING HOME SAFE STORAGE INFORMATION TO PARENTS IS NOT A REACTIVE MEASURE. AT SCHOOL WE HOLD ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS AND HAVE EXPERIENCE LOCKDOWNS IN FACT I JUST GOT A CALL THIS MORNING THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL I WORKING WITH UNDER LOCKDOWN. WE ALSO DO CRISIS TRAINING FOR FACULTY. PARENTS NEED TO BE INFORMED AND BE RESPONSIBLE AS WELL. THIS IS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE MUCH LIKE OTHER PREVENTIVE MEASURES WE TAKE TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE SEAT BELTS AGE RESTRICTIONS ON CIGARETTE PURCHASES DRIVING AND TEXTING LOST. WE HAVE BRADY CALIFORNIA RECOMMENDS THAT THE SAFE GOING STORAGE INFORMATION ON CALIFORNIA'S LAWS WHICH IS THE CAP BE SENT HOME TO ALL STUDENTS WHO ATTEND PUBLIC AND CHARTER SCHOOLS PREVENTING CHILD ACCESS TO FIRE ARMS NOT ONLY REDUCES THE RISK OF UNINTENTIONAL AND SUICIDAL SHOOTINGS IN THE HOME BUT ALSO PRODUCES THE RISK OF SHOOTING.

THESE YOUNG PEOPLE DEAL WITH THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA AND LANGUAGE AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS DALY WHILE NAVIGATING SCHOOL CHANGES WHICH CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRESS AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND THEIR MOTIVATION AND SELF WORTH. ALLIANCE CLIENTS RACHEL STORY WILL HELP EXPLAIN WHY AB ONE FIFTY IS SO IMPORTANT. RACHEL WAS REMOVED FROM HER PARENTS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND CHANGED HOME PLACEMENTS IN SCHOOLS SIX TIMES IN HIGH SCHOOL AS YOUR SOCIAL WORKER ATTEMPTED TO FIND THE BEST PLACEMENT FOR HER AND HER TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS. AT EACH NEW SCHOOL RACHEL HAD TO LEARN A NEW SET OF SCHOOL ROUTINE THE POLICIES MAKE NEW FRIENDS MEET WITH ADMINISTRATORS AND CATCH UP ON CLASSES. SHE WAS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH SCHOOL SHE PREVIOUSLY ATTENDED FAILED TO ISSUE CREDIT FOR THE WORK SHE COMPLETED IMMENSELY HADTO START HER CLASSES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE RAILING HER PROGRESS TOWARD BECOMING A NURSE. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SHE HAD EARNED CREDITS IN ENGLISH NINE AT A PRIOR SCHOOL ONE SCHOOL TOLD HER SHE'D HAVE TO START OVER BECAUSE THE NEW SCHOOL OFFERED A COURSE CALLED ENGLISH ONE. AND THEY WOULD NOT COMBINED HER ENGLISH NINE CREDITS WITH THE ENGLISH RUN CREDITS TO GET HER ONE YEAR COURSE NEEDED FOR GRADUATION. EVENTUALLY RACIAL WAS FOR REFER TO OUR ATTORNEYS THROUGH THEIR ADVOCACY RACHEL WAS ABLE TO COLLECT ALL OF HER CREDIT AND HER ATTORNEYS WORKED WITH HER TO DEVELOP GRADUATION PLAN WITHOUT THAT ADVOCACY SHOULD NOT RECEIVE YOUR CREDIT. WILL NOT ABLE TO ACCUMULATE UNDER THE STORE GRADUATION AND SHE COULD. EASE SOMEONE UP 40% NOT GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DILIGENT WORK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THIS ISSUE.

I'D LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD I HAD THE PRIVILEGE LAST FALL OF VISITING A NON PUBLIC SCHOOL PRIVATE PLACEMENT SETTING FOR SOME OF MY REGION'S MOST CHALLENGED EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN AND WHAT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE TO ME IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE STAFF WAS REALLY EMBRACING NOT ONLY THE LATEST IN RESEARCH DEVELOP TECHNIQUES BUT ACTUALLY EMPLOYED THEIR OWN RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD OF BOTH KINESIOLOGY AND ENGINEERING FIRMS OF DEVELOPING SAFE PHYSICAL RE DIRECTION- AND THEN HAD COMPLETELY REVAMPED. CONCEPT OF COLLUSION IT REALLY CAME MORE ABOUT TEACHING AN EMPOWERING THESE CHILDREN WITH THE TECHNIQUES TO LEARN TO DE ESCALATE THEMSELVES AND I THINK THEY'RE REALLY ULTIMATELY AS EDUCATORS THAT'S WHAT ALL IS FOR ALL OF US SO I THINK VERY MUCH IS VERY THE MEASUREMENT PLAN TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY.
