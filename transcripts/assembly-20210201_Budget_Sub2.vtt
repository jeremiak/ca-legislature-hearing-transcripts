00:44:57.327 --> 00:44:58.529
GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING A

00:44:58.595 --> 00:44:59.630
THIRD ROUNDER THEY'RE IN THE

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:01.465
MIDST OF THAT NOW WHAT THEY'RE

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:03.033
CONTEMPLATING AS A STARTING

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.535
POINT EVEN LARGER THAN THE

00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:06.470
FIRST TWO ROUNDS I'M ALMOST

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.439
COMBINED SO IF CALIFORNIA WERE

00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:09.973
TO RECEIVE THE SAME PROPORTION.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.175
OF THAT THIRD ROUND THAT

00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:12.910
THEY'RE CONTEMPLATING RIGHT NOW

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:14.378
IT WOULD BE- GETTING

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:15.579
APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND A HALF

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:18.182
BILLION- BUT THAT AGAIN IS JUST

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:20.017
A POTENTIAL FUNDING TO CALM.

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:21.585
EVEN WITH THE FEDERALLY FUNDED

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:23.187
CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:26.423
COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES IN

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.024
TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR EXAMPLE

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:29.726
MOST CAMPUSES ARE HOLDING THEIR

00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:30.894
VACANT POSITIONS OPEN. EVEN

00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:32.196
WITH THE COST CONTAINMENT

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:33.230
MEASURES WE KNOW THAT THE

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:34.565
UNIVERSITIES ARE PROJECTING

00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:36.700
OPERATING DEFICITS FOR TWENTY

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:38.135
TWENTY ONE. THE ISSUE IS

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:39.803
PROJECTING AN OPERATING DEFICIT

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.472
OF ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:45:41.538 --> 00:45:42.906
ON THE CORE OPERATING PART OF

00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:45.843
THEIR BUDGET. AND YOU SEE I'M A

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:49.113
DEFICIT OF- AT LEAST A HUNDRED

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:52.916
AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION.

00:45:52.983 --> 00:45:54.384
SHIFTING FROM ALL OF THIS

00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:56.120
BACKDROP AS JUST WHERE THEY ARE

00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:58.122
NOW- TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:45:58.188 --> 00:45:59.123
PROPOSED FOR THEM YOU'VE

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.157
ALREADY HEARD OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.592
PROPOSALS ALL JUST JUMP RIGHT

00:46:01.658 --> 00:46:03.427
INTO SOME ISSUES THAT YOU MIGHT

00:46:03.494 --> 00:46:04.027
WANT TO CONSIDER IN THE WEEKS

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:05.896
AHEAD. SO AS YOU THINK ABOUT

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:07.531
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BASED

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:09.233
INCREASE SAYS WE WOULD SUGGEST

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:09.867
YOU THINK OF THOSE AS A

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:11.768
STARTING POINT. SO AT THE

00:46:11.835 --> 00:46:13.470
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED LEVELS THE

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:14.438
SEGMENTS WOULD HAVE ENOUGH TO

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:16.940
COVER HEALTH CARE. AND PENSION

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:19.076
COST INCREASES IT HAVE SOME

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:20.511
LEFT OVER THAT THEY CAN THINK

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:21.879
ABOUT FOR MODEST SALARY

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:23.680
INCREASES OR STAFFING

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:25.582
RESTORATIONS. I THINK YOU

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:26.850
PROBABLY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL MAY

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:28.452
BEFORE YOU DECIDE EXACTLY ON

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:30.154
THE LEVEL OF BASED INCREASES AT

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.021
THAT TIME YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.823
BETTER IDEA OF THE STATE'S OUT

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.091
YOUR OPERATING DEFICITS AT

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:35.726
LEAST A SOMEWHAT BETTER IDEA.

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:36.793
AND THAT COULD HELP YOU

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.262
DETERMINE HOW COMFORTABLE YOU

00:46:38.328 --> 00:46:40.697
ARE WITH EITHER THE 3% AND A

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.065
HALF PERCENT FOR THE COMMUNITY

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:45.135
COLLEGES SOMEWHERE HIGHER OF

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:46.003
LOWER. REGARDING THE

00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:47.738
EXPECTATIONS THAT RELATE TO

00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.306
STUDENT EQUITY ONLINE LEARNING

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:51.241
IN THE TRANSFER PROCESS WE

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:52.075
THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:53.677
IDENTIFIED AREAS OF COMMON

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:54.878
INTEREST WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:57.014
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN TALKING

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.581
ABOUT THESE ISSUES FOR MANY

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.917
YEARS. BUT IT'S ON THE

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:00.951
PROPOSALS WE THINK COULD BE

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:03.787
IMPROVED- PRESUMABLY IF

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:05.389
INTERESTED YOU AND STAFF COULD

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:06.757
BE WORKING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:07.791
OF MONTHS WORK FOR ALL THE

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:09.193
DETAILS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:10.327
PROPOSALS AND WE HAVE SOME

00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:12.963
IDEAS. FOR YOU TO CONSIDER ON

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.464
HOW TO IMPROVE THEM. THE

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:15.832
GOVERNOR AS YOU KNOW HAS THIS

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.334
PACKAGE OF STUDENT SUPPORT

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.403
PROPOSALS STUDENT BASIC NEEDS

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:21.271
EMERGENCY GRANTS STUDENT MENTAL

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:23.440
HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ISSUES. IN

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.342
THESE CASES WE THINK THAT AGAIN

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:26.710
THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.345
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED

00:47:28.412 --> 00:47:30.480
BUT NOT ONLY LONG STANDING BUT

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:33.050
EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC-

00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:34.451
BUT IF YOU DO DECIDE TO PUT

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:35.886
MORE ONGOING MONEY INTO THESE

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.054
PROGRAMS WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.322
STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT MAKE

00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:39.356
SURE THAT THE PROGRAM'S

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:40.958
OBJECTIVES ARE CLEAR. THAT YOU

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:42.526
HAVE A WAY TO MEASURE THEM AND

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.595
THAT YOU'RE AND YOUR AND I MEAN

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:46.163
I'M PLACE TOOLS TO ASSESS

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.432
WHETHER THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:49.566
ACHIEVING THEIR OBJECTIVES. I

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:50.601
WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:52.302
THINK ABOUT ALIGNING THE STATE

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.503
FUNDS WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.138
THAT YOU KNOW NOW I'M DOWN DO

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:56.607
EXIST FOR THE SECOND ROUND OF

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:59.576
RELIEF- NEED FOR EXAMPLE YOU

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.878
COULD USE THE STATE FUNDS TO-

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:03.080
GIVE GRANTS TO STUDENTS WHO

00:48:03.146 --> 00:48:04.648
MIGHT BE POTENTIALLY INELIGIBLE

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:05.983
FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS. OR YOU

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:09.052
COULD USE THE STATE FUNDS ONCE

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:09.620
THE FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE DRIED

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:12.122
DRIED UP. LONGER TERM WE THINK

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:13.457
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:15.192
HAVING A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:16.193
FOR HOW THE STATE IS DEALING

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.061
WITH STUDENT BASIC NEEDS.

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:19.696
APPROACH TO DATE HAS BEEN

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:22.232
SOMEWHAT PEACE NOW. THE LAST

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:25.068
WEEK AS THE STATE'S ON IF IT IF

00:48:25.135 --> 00:48:26.670
THE STATE'S FISCAL OUTLOOK WORD

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.405
TO IMPROVE COME MAY WE THINK

00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:30.073
YOU COULD CONSIDER PAYING DOWN

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.608
MORE DEFERRALS THAT WOULD BE ON

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:32.643
THE NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF YOUR

00:48:32.709 --> 00:48:35.545
BUDGET. YOU COULD ALSO COME IN-

00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:37.347
CONSIDER PROVIDING MORE FOR

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:38.749
UNIVERSITY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:40.183
THAT WOULD BE ON THE NINE

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:40.751
NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF YOUR

00:48:40.817 --> 00:48:42.786
BUDGET. BUT BOTH ACTIONS WOULD

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:45.989
HELP IMPROVE BOTH THE STATE AND

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:46.456
THE STATEMENTS BUDGET

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:48.125

ENROLLMENT TARGETS FOR THAT FOR

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:22.625
THE- TWO SEGMENTS UC AND CSU.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:23.492
CERTAINLY BROWN RELEASED FROM

DEPARTMENT OF. THANK YOU FOR

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:27.430
THE QUESTION. TO TWO POINTS

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:29.899
ABOUT ENROLLMENT AT CSU AND UC

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.667
THE FIRST IS OUR BIG FOCUS WITH

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.869
THIS BUDGET WAS ON THE CCC'S.

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.404
BECAUSE ENROLLMENT DROPPED

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:38.474
EIGHT PERCENT. WE ESTIMATE FROM

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.910
THIS FALL COMPARED TO LAST FALL.

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:43.145
THE SECOND POINT IS THAT CSU

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:46.682
AND UC- WHEREAS NATIONALLY

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:47.283
THERE HAS BEEN SOME STRUGGLES

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.118
WITH ENROLLMENT. WE'RE

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.519
FORTUNATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:52.388
CSU AND UC ARE NOT PROJECTING

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:54.290
ENROLLMENT DROPS AND IN FACT

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:59.128
UC. WAS ABLE TO MEET A TWENTY

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:01.530
NINETEEN TARGET. INCREASE OF

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:02.498
FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.233
STUDENTS BUT THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.935
ADDED AND FUNDED IN TWENTY

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:08.004
NINETEEN. AND THAT THAT AMOUNT

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.805
OF FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED SPREAD

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:12.074
OVER INTO THE COVE IT ACADEMIC

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:14.777
YEAR. SO THERE WAS INITIALLY

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:16.512
THAT. ONE COULD HAVE BEEN

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.114
CONCERNED THAT MAYBE THEY

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.749
WOULDN'T MEET THAT WITH ALL THE

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:22.785
UNCERTAINTY. ARE SO FROM OUR

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:24.520
PERSPECTIVE. IT'S A BIG DEAL

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.523
THE UC WAS ABLE TO MEET THAT

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.090
FORTY EIGHT SIXTY ADDITIONAL

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:30.660
STUDENTS AND GROW DURING CALL

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:35.131
THAT- SO THAT'S OUR PERSPECTIVE.

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:36.832
OKAY AND WHAT WHAT IS THE L. A.

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:39.335
L. THINK ABOUT. THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:41.170
IN THE STATE. TYING DOWN A

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:44.674
ROMAN TARGETS. I'M JENNIFER

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.976
PATEL AGAIN L. A. L. AT YEAH AS

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:49.378
WE RECOMMENDED HISTORICALLY WE

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.047
THINK- STUDYING AND ROMAN

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.515
TARGETS AS AN IMPORTANT STATE

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.483
RESPONSIBILITY LEGISLATURE

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:57.887
TYPICALLY DOES SET THEM- SO WE-

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:59.121
RECOGNIZE IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:00.656
CHALLENGING THIS YEAR BECAUSE

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.391
YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF THE FORCES

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.959
OUT WORK AND IT'S NOT REALLY

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:06.128
CLEAR WELL THEY'LL ALL LAND SO

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:07.330
WE KNOW HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:08.964
ARE PROJECTED TO GO OVER VERY

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.700
SLOWLY. WE KNOW COMMUNITY

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.802
COLLEGES ENROLLMENT IS DOWN

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:14.370
PRETTY STEEPLY IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:18.174
ONE- ROUGHLY 10% WE KNOW UC AND

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.543
CSU DID GROW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:22.411
ONE PERCENT- AND EACH OF THEM

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.347
DURING TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:26.082
DON'T KNOW HOW THE ECONOMY WILL

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.550
REACT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.118
BASKET VACCINE DISTRIBUTION

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:30.586
ALTHOUGH WHEN BOTH K. TWELVE

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:31.787
STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS WILL

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:37.927
LIKE NORMAL FOR THEM SO IT'S

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:39.228
HARD FOR US TO TELL YOU WHETHER

COMING YEAR OR OR UP OR DOWN-

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.901
WE DO CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:47.336

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.407
ADMISSIONS PROCESS SO IT'S

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:52.842
ALMOST TOO LATE RIGHT NOW TO

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.277
INFLUENCE THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:55.878
TWO YEAR A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.279
MAKING THEIR DECISIONS RIGHT

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.681
NOW AND THEY WILL HAVE MADE

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:00.716
THEM BEFORE JUNE. SO WE CAN

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:02.017
SEND YOU THAT ENCOURAGE YOU TO

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:05.020
THINK ABOUT SETTING TARGETS FOR

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:05.588
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IT'S

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.123
JUST IT'S HARD- YOU WILL HAVE

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.891
TO SORT OF MAKE JUST A JUDGMENT

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.192
CALL DO YOU WANT THEM TO GROW

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:12.328
OR STAY FLAT GROW BY 2% BECAUSE

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:13.262
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A LOT OF

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.030
CLARITY FROM THE FORCES AT

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:17.166
WORK. IF I COULD JUST ONE

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:18.167
MINUTE ON THIS ISSUE OF THE

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:19.201
COLA BECAUSE IT'S QUITE AN

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:20.936
INTERESTING ISSUE WHETHER IT

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:24.073
SCHOOL DISTRICTS COLLEGES UCCS

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.175
YOU THE BULK OF THE BUDGETS ARE

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:27.977
COMPENSATION AND THEY'RE ALL

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:29.578
FACING INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:31.514
COSTS ARE ALL FACING INCREASES

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.215
IN PENSION COSTS ARE ALL FACING

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:35.251
SALARY PRESSURES AND THEY'RE

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:36.786
ALL STILL FACING STAFFING

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:38.687
PRESSURES JUST A LEVEL OF STAFF

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:39.889
THAT THEY HAVE. SO IT IS

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:45.561
INTERESTING WHY IN. SCHOOL

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:46.162
DISTRICTS MAKE IT THREE POINT

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:47.062
84% THE COLLEGE MIGHT GET ONE

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:47.930
POINT. PER AND UNIVERSE WOULD

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:49.899
BE LEFT ON LEVEL THAT'S EVEN BY

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.734
TO THEIR NINETEEN TWENTY LEVEL

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:52.501
SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:54.503
ABOUT WHAT DO YOU WHAT YOU

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.372

WHERE YOU WANT THEM TO LAND

WHEN YOU DO YOUR FINAL BUDGET

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:02.545

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:08.984
THE COST FOR. HER FOR STAFFING-

01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:11.053
FACULTY AND CREDENTIALED.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.823
FACULTY IS THE SAME MEDICAID

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:14.990
TWELVE SCHOOL COMMUNICABLE TO

01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:16.959
YOU SEE THE CSU SO WE SHOULD DO

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:18.861

AND CSU. FUNDING I KNOW WE HAVE

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:28.204
A LOT OF ONE TIME MONEY COMING

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.706
IN. WE COULD GET MUCH MORE IF

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.808
WE HAVE THE THIRD. TESTING THIS

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:33.542
BILL THAT'S BEING DEBATED RIGHT

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.511
NOW IN CONGRESS. THAT'S

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:36.178

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:49.325
THE PAIN THIS IS CAUSED ON OUR

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:52.428
LOWER INCOME STUDENTS- DONNELLY

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:53.896

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.802
OF STEPS THAT THE ENROLLMENT I

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:01.337
THINK THAT THE HEADLINES WITH

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:02.571
WE SEE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.840
APPLYING TO UC. ARE THROUGH THE

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:07.009

THOSE. STUDENTS ARE APPLY OR

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:09.678
SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:18.354
HOUSING AND ALL THAT I THINK IS

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.622
SO CRITICAL I KNOW THERE'S-

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:20.890
SOME ONE TIME MONEY IN THERE

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.024
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:24.026
WE MAY TRY TO PUT MORE. FOR ON

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:26.729

SYSTEMS AND CERTAINLY WITH THE-

02:02:05.184 --> 02:02:07.620

02:02:17.329 --> 02:02:19.799

02:02:45.357 --> 02:02:47.059
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK

02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:49.428
TOGETHER WITH THE STATE TO-

02:02:49.495 --> 02:02:52.631

CLOSE AND ELIMINATE. EQUITY

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:32.651

PLACE IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK

02:07:23.836 --> 02:07:25.337
BECAUSE CLOSING EQUITY GAPS

02:07:25.404 --> 02:07:27.706
MAKE MEANS MAKING VERY

02:07:27.773 --> 02:07:29.341
DIFFICULT CHOICES VERY.

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:30.976
COURAGEOUS CHOICES ABOUT HOW

02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:35.381
WE- USE THE RESOURCES THAT WE

02:07:35.447 --> 02:07:39.218

02:07:39.284 --> 02:07:41.286
SUPPORTING OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS

02:07:41.353 --> 02:07:42.688
IS IMPORTANT TO EQUITY AS WELL

02:07:42.755 --> 02:07:44.656
BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE MORE OF

02:07:44.723 --> 02:07:46.625
OUR STUDENTS TRANSFER. TO THE

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:47.793

THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DRIVE-

02:08:22.227 --> 02:08:23.529

WITHOUT PRESENT DRAKE YEAH

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:39.611
ABSOLUTELY OKAY. EMBER HEY S. I

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:41.013
APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR CALL

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:44.283
AND- WE EMBRACE THE MINDED

02:08:44.349 --> 02:08:45.751
APPROACH THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:08:45.818 --> 02:08:48.520
TAKEN AND HAS BUDGET. AND THERE

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:50.389
ARE AT LEAST TWO WAYS IN WHICH

02:08:50.456 --> 02:08:52.458
I VERY MUCH WANT TO FOCUS ON

02:08:52.524 --> 02:08:55.761
EQUITY HERE MY FIRST YEAR- THE

02:08:55.828 --> 02:08:59.364
FIRST ONE- RELATES TO- THE

02:08:59.431 --> 02:09:02.434
EQUITY GAPS THAT EXIST IN OUR-

02:09:02.501 --> 02:09:05.637
GRADUATION. RATE DATA UP AND

02:09:05.704 --> 02:09:08.307
DOWN STATE AND IT'S MY HOPE

02:09:08.373 --> 02:09:12.111
THAT WE CAN GET THOSE GAPS DOWN

02:09:12.177 --> 02:09:13.912
TO IS CLOSE TO ZERO AS POSSIBLE

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:16.215
AS WE LEFT UP THE GRADUATION

02:09:16.281 --> 02:09:19.184
RATES FOR EACH. OF OUR CAMPUSES

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:21.487
AND- IT'LL BE VERY IMPORTANT

02:09:21.553 --> 02:09:23.889
FOR US TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER

02:09:23.956 --> 02:09:26.058
IN THAT PROCESS YOU ASKED ABOUT

02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:27.426
HOW THAT COULD BE DONE IN TERMS

02:09:27.493 --> 02:09:32.197
OF PRACTICES. AND I DO BELIEVE

02:09:32.264 --> 02:09:33.599
THAT AT THE- THERE ARE SO CAMP

02:09:33.665 --> 02:09:36.535
THAT. CLOSE THOSE GAPS DOWN TO

02:09:36.602 --> 02:09:40.139
ZERO IN A PAL AREA OR IN-

02:09:40.205 --> 02:09:41.106
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENT AREA

02:09:41.173 --> 02:09:43.175
AND OTHERS THAT HAVE NOT YET

02:09:43.242 --> 02:09:44.543
GOTTEN THERE SO I THINK THERE

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:45.844
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:47.646
LEARN TOGETHER- WITHIN OUR

02:09:47.713 --> 02:09:50.749
SYSTEM. AND THEN SECONDLY-

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:52.217
PRESENT DRAKE MENTION THIS IN

02:09:52.284 --> 02:09:53.552
HIS REMARKS I THINK THERE'S AN

02:09:53.619 --> 02:09:55.220
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK

02:09:55.287 --> 02:09:57.823
TOGETHER. AROUND DIVERSITY OF

02:09:57.890 --> 02:10:00.325
FACULTY AND THINKING ABOUT OUR

02:10:00.392 --> 02:10:02.861
OUR PATHWAYS IN PIPELINES AND

02:10:02.928 --> 02:10:04.429
CRAPS AND EVEN MORE CREATIVE

02:10:04.496 --> 02:10:07.699
THAN A ROBUST WAY AND MY HOPE

02:10:07.766 --> 02:10:09.568
IS THAT OVER TIME WE CAN. ADD

02:10:09.635 --> 02:10:11.236
TOGETHER ALL OF OUR LEADERS

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:13.138
WORKING TOGETHER CAN DIVERSIFY

02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:14.406
OUR FACULTIES SO THAT THEY

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:17.242
BETTER REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF

02:10:17.309 --> 02:10:20.045
OUR STUDENTS- SO THOSE ARE TWO

02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:20.879
PARTICULAR WAYS THAT I'D LIKE

02:10:20.946 --> 02:10:25.450

TOGETHER AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.136

THAT WAS AWAY FROM THE AVERSA

02:10:51.944 --> 02:10:53.612
CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST SIX

02:10:53.679 --> 02:10:55.280
YEARS WERE WORKED ON- PROGRAMS

02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:56.715
NATIONALLY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN

02:10:56.782 --> 02:10:58.717
DO TO ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS AND

02:10:58.784 --> 02:11:00.285

PUSH FORWARD TO TRY TO HAVE AN

02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:07.593
ELIMINATION OF EQUITY GAPS IN

02:11:07.659 --> 02:11:09.061
ALLTHE WAYS THAT THEY THEIR

02:11:09.127 --> 02:11:11.630
CURRENT. AND IT'S ACTUALLY WE

02:11:11.697 --> 02:11:12.998
THIS IS WHAT I WANT OF CONGRESS

02:11:13.065 --> 02:11:15.167

FAR AS I SEE. IS THAT YOU HAVE

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:49.334
TO HAVE A PLAN. AND YOU HAVE TO

02:11:49.401 --> 02:11:51.937

YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THOSE.

02:11:52.704 --> 02:11:53.972
AND COURAGEOUS DECISION. ABOUT

02:11:54.039 --> 02:11:56.074
MO FUND FROM ONE AREA TO

ANOTHER. THOSE ARE COURAGEOUS

02:11:57.409 --> 02:11:58.944
DECISIONS THAT HAVE TO BE MADE.

02:11:59.011 --> 02:12:01.613
BUT IF THE PLAN IS TO WORK ON

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:04.449
EQUITY. AND IT IS INTENTIONAL I

02:12:04.516 --> 02:12:07.686

SYSTEMS AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER

02:12:25.304 --> 02:12:26.071
WE DIDN'T TAKE THE TRADITIONAL

02:12:26.138 --> 02:12:27.839
PATH AND I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE

02:12:27.906 --> 02:12:29.808
TALKING ABOUT EQUITY. AS MY

02:12:29.875 --> 02:12:31.710
PATH WAS DIFFICULT AS A MATTER

02:12:31.777 --> 02:12:34.179
OF FACT- BECAUSE OF A TRANSFER

02:12:34.246 --> 02:12:36.048
OF UNITS- DIDN'T COMPLETE MY

02:12:36.114 --> 02:12:39.384
DEGREE BY A CLASS AND THAT WAS

02:12:39.451 --> 02:12:40.452
ALSO THE TIME WE'RE FINE

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:41.853
THERE'S FINANCIAL STRAIN ON MY

ARE DEALING WITH AT THIS VERY

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:49.227
MOMENT SO I AM A LITTLE CURIOUS

02:12:49.294 --> 02:12:52.130
IS THERE ARE CAN WE EXPECT TO

02:12:52.197 --> 02:12:53.532
SEE A DROP IN GRADUATION RATES

02:12:53.598 --> 02:12:55.000
HOW WHAT ARE WE DOING

02:12:55.067 --> 02:12:57.636

HAVE A FEW OTHER OTHER

02:13:02.774 --> 02:13:04.576
QUESTIONS AS WELL BUT I WOULD

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:06.645
LOVE TO KIND OF JUST GET THE

02:13:06.712 --> 02:13:08.213
REAL THE REAL PICTURE THE REAL

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.049
NUMBERS THAT WHAT WE THINK WE

02:13:11.116 --> 02:13:14.586
MAY BE LOOKING AT. I WILL

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:17.289
START- SINCE THERE'S BEEN A LOT

02:13:17.356 --> 02:13:19.991
OF DISCUSSION- IN CALIFORNIA

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:21.927

SPACE IS ECONOMIC SO THAT IS

02:14:14.112 --> 02:14:16.415

02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:57.889
LESS CLASSES SO THAT DOES HAVE

02:14:57.956 --> 02:14:59.691
AN IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO

02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:33.964
IN IN STATE- US THROUGH AND SO

02:29:34.031 --> 02:29:36.967
THE OVERALL. EXPERIENCE THAT I

02:29:37.034 --> 02:29:40.071
HAVE DIRECT AND I'M FROM. OVER

02:29:40.137 --> 02:29:41.672
LOOK BACK TO THE THINGS I READ

02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:43.808
SOME YEAH THAT WAS A DIFFERENT

02:29:43.874 --> 02:29:47.144
PLAY OF THE OVERALL- CAL STOOD

02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:52.116
HERE AND SO BUT THAT I YOUR

02:29:52.183 --> 02:29:53.984
PROBABLY GO FROM ABOUT IT CAN

02:29:54.051 --> 02:29:57.254
NOT COULDN'T I COULD SAY THAT.

02:29:57.321 --> 02:29:57.888
I THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:29:57.955 --> 02:29:59.957
THING IS THAT WE CREATE OUR FOR

02:30:00.024 --> 02:30:02.193
K. TO. AND THAT WE KEEP OUR

02:30:02.259 --> 02:30:06.230
UNIVERSE AS ACT AS CAN CAN BE A-

02:30:06.297 --> 02:30:07.898
I THINK THAT IT'S A WE'VE HAD A

02:30:07.965 --> 02:30:10.234
BY PROGRAM UP IN. AS WE

02:30:10.301 --> 02:30:11.902
INCREASING AGAIN THE PLACE

02:30:11.969 --> 02:30:13.671
WHERE I BEEN RESPONSIBLE WE

02:30:13.738 --> 02:30:17.007
INCREASE AS- THE IN STATE

02:30:17.074 --> 02:30:20.878
STUDENTS MORE- THERE AND-

02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:22.613
THAT'S WE'VE HAD OTHER STUDENTS

02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:24.949
COME INTO THE UNIT. OVERALL

02:30:25.015 --> 02:30:26.650
LARGER AND THAT SOME THAT I

02:30:26.717 --> 02:30:29.186
COMMIT TO- I MEAN I THINK

02:30:29.253 --> 02:30:43.834
THAT'S NOT- AND IT THANKS-

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:45.403
SENATE JUST USED TO BE SO THAT

02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:48.072
WE COULD INCREASE. MORE SLOTS

02:30:48.139 --> 02:30:50.841
FOR CALIFORNIANS. WELL IT'S A

02:30:50.908 --> 02:30:52.209
COMPLICATED QUESTION AS YOU OF

02:30:52.276 --> 02:30:53.911
COURSE THOUGH AND LET ME SAY

02:30:53.978 --> 02:30:55.246
THIS THAT'S HAPPENED IN MY

02:30:55.312 --> 02:31:00.785
AGAIN MY EXPERIENCE. THE- OVER

02:31:00.851 --> 02:31:02.353
THE LAST MANY YEARS AND YOU

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:04.588
KNOW THIS IS BEEN A NATIONAL

02:31:04.655 --> 02:31:07.024
NATIONAL TREND- AS BUDGETS WERE

02:31:07.091 --> 02:31:09.427
DODD DECREASED BY UNIVERSITY

02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:11.462
FOR TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE

02:31:11.529 --> 02:31:12.296
FACULTY STUDENT RATIO IS THE

02:31:12.363 --> 02:31:14.165
NUMBER OF CLASSES THAT STUDENTS

02:31:14.231 --> 02:31:15.966
NEEDED TO IN- TO HAVE TO BE

02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:17.768
ABLE TO GRADUATE ON TIME AND

02:31:17.835 --> 02:31:19.403
THERE WERE- AND THEY FOUND THAT

02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:20.571
ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT WAS

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:22.440
TO DIVERSIFY AT THE POOL OF

02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:23.674
STUDENTS WHO CAME IN PARTICULAR

02:31:23.741 --> 02:31:24.975
THOSE ARE BROUGHT IN FUNDING

02:31:25.042 --> 02:31:27.878
FROM OUT OF STATE. AND WHAT

02:31:27.945 --> 02:31:29.280
HAPPENED AGAIN I USE MY OWN-

02:31:29.346 --> 02:31:30.748
EXPERIENCE THERE. WHAT WE SAW

02:31:30.815 --> 02:31:31.682
IS THAT IS WE HAD STUDENTS WHO

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:34.084
CAME IN FROM. OTHER PLACES OUT

02:31:34.151 --> 02:31:35.586
OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL.

02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:37.822
THERE WERE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS

02:31:37.888 --> 02:31:39.089
TO THE STUDENTS WHO WERE IN.

02:31:39.156 --> 02:31:40.891
THE CLASSES I. TEACH CLASSES

02:31:40.958 --> 02:31:42.993
AND WEED OUT OF BENEFIT

02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:44.628
EDUCATIONALLY FROM PEOPLE FROM

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:45.830
DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVES COMING

02:31:45.896 --> 02:31:47.798
IN. BUT TO YOUR POINT PROP

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:48.966
AVERAGES FOR CALIFORNIA

02:31:49.033 --> 02:31:50.601
STUDENTS THOSE STUDENTS TENDED

02:31:50.668 --> 02:31:53.537
TO BRING IN MORE FUNDING- THEN

02:31:53.604 --> 02:31:55.206
THEY ARE COST. AND THEY

02:31:55.272 --> 02:31:56.240
ACTUALLY WOULD INCREASE

02:31:56.307 --> 02:31:58.209
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR IN STATE

02:31:58.275 --> 02:32:00.644
STUDENTS AS- AS WELL SO. IF WE

02:32:00.711 --> 02:32:02.446
WERE A FREEWAY AND WE HAD THREE

02:32:02.513 --> 02:32:06.183
LANES AND WE HAD THEN- LANE-

02:32:06.250 --> 02:32:07.184
THAT WAS STUDENTS COMING FROM

02:32:07.251 --> 02:32:09.487
OTHER PLACES. IT WASN'T WE WENT

02:32:09.553 --> 02:32:11.355
FROM A THREE LANE. FREEWAY TO A

02:32:11.422 --> 02:32:13.424
FOUR LANE WENT FROM THREE LANES

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:14.925
TO FIVE LANES. AND SO WE HAD

02:32:14.992 --> 02:32:16.927
MORE LANES FOR IN STATE

02:32:16.994 --> 02:32:18.429
RESIDENTS. AT THE SAME TIME

02:32:18.496 --> 02:32:19.330
THAT WE HAD OTHER STUDENTS

02:32:19.396 --> 02:32:21.031
COMING IN AND- IT WAS THE WAY

02:32:21.098 --> 02:32:22.199
THAT WE ACTUALLY BY THE WAY

02:32:22.266 --> 02:32:23.200
THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE

02:32:23.267 --> 02:32:24.602
FACULTY TO HAVE. MORE

02:32:24.668 --> 02:32:26.237
OPPORTUNITY FOR IN STATE

02:32:26.303 --> 02:32:28.506
STUDENTS SO. I WILL I'M HAPPY

02:32:28.572 --> 02:32:30.174
TO TALK AS WE CAN TALK MORE OFF

02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:31.876
LINE ABOUT WHAT THE- THE PROPER

02:32:31.942 --> 02:32:34.078
BALANCE IS AND- THAT'S

02:32:34.144 --> 02:32:35.346
SOMETHING ABOUT THE PICK MORE

02:32:35.412 --> 02:32:37.515
REFLECTION BUT- MAILLET. WHAT

02:32:37.581 --> 02:32:38.282
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WAS TO

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:39.850
HAPPEN INCREASED AGAIN CREATION

02:32:39.917 --> 02:32:41.785
OPPORTUNITIES- FOR STUDENTS

02:32:41.852 --> 02:32:44.021
FROM BE IN STATE POPULATION. AS

02:32:44.088 --> 02:32:45.189
WE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:32:45.256 --> 02:32:46.957
OTHER STUDENTS AS AS WELL AND

02:32:47.024 --> 02:32:48.092
AGAIN SOMETHING I'M I'M HAPPY

02:32:48.158 --> 02:32:50.394
TO TALK. WITH YOU ABOUT IT IN

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:52.229
MORE IN MORE DETAIL RIGHT BUT-

02:32:52.296 --> 02:32:53.898
WITH ALL. DUE RESPECT PRESIDENT

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:55.866
DRAKE DURING DURING THAT TIME

02:32:55.933 --> 02:32:59.904
JUST TO. CLARIFY UC DIDN'T SEE

02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:02.606
A DECREASE. IN STATE STUDENT

02:33:02.673 --> 02:33:04.341
FUNDING AT LEAST FOR THE LAST

02:33:04.408 --> 02:33:04.942
EIGHT YEARS THIS ON INCREASE

02:33:05.009 --> 02:33:07.478
EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IN AND AGAIN

02:33:07.545 --> 02:33:10.681
OUR PROBLEM WAS INTEL WE-

02:33:10.748 --> 02:33:13.250
INTERCEDED AND FORCED.

02:33:13.317 --> 02:33:14.652
PRESIDENT APOLLO TONNEAU TO

02:33:14.718 --> 02:33:16.820
INCREASE IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT

02:33:16.887 --> 02:33:18.489
IT UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT HAPPEN

02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:20.324
ON ITS OWN EVEN THOUGH. THE

02:33:20.391 --> 02:33:22.126
UNIVERSITY WAS GETTING

02:33:22.192 --> 02:33:25.129
COMMENSURATE BUDGET. INCREASES

02:33:25.195 --> 02:33:31.468
SUCH THAT IS. PART OF THE CRUX.

02:33:31.535 --> 02:33:32.536
OF THE PROBLEM AND FOR. I THINK

02:33:32.603 --> 02:33:34.171
ON. GET- YOU YOU BROKE DOWN THE

02:33:34.238 --> 02:33:35.773
PROBLEM VERY VERY BECAUSE- VERY

02:33:35.839 --> 02:33:37.274
SIMPLY COULD SIMPLY ABOUT

02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:39.977
MONEY- THE OUT OF STATE

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:42.713
STUDENTS BRING IN MONEY. THAT

02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:45.015
THE STATE STUDENTS DON'T. AND

02:33:45.082 --> 02:33:46.216
THERE IS A FINANCIAL

02:33:46.283 --> 02:33:49.420
PROPOSITION AND I THINK WE HAVE.

02:33:49.486 --> 02:33:51.088
IN THE PAST PASSED THE

02:33:51.155 --> 02:33:53.457
UNIVERSITY TO PROVIDE-

02:33:53.524 --> 02:33:55.359
INFORMATION OF WHAT IT WOULD

02:33:55.426 --> 02:33:58.329
TAKE TO- BY THE OUT OF STATE

02:33:58.395 --> 02:34:00.831
STUDENTS OUT AND I THINK WE

02:34:00.898 --> 02:34:03.367
CONTINUE TO WATER PURSUE THAT-

02:34:03.434 --> 02:34:04.735
I THINK THAT QUESTION I DON'T

02:34:04.802 --> 02:34:06.604
THINK THE STATE IS ANYWAYS.

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:08.005
ASKING THE UNIVERSITY TO TAKE A

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:10.541
LOSS ON ACCEPTING MORE IN STATE

02:34:10.608 --> 02:34:11.976
STUDENTS BUT I THINK WE ARE

02:34:12.042 --> 02:34:14.979
WANTING TO HAVE A REALISTIC-

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:19.049
ON. A REALISTIC DISCUSSION- HI

02:34:19.116 --> 02:34:21.919
I WILL SAY THIS- PUBLICLY

02:34:21.986 --> 02:34:23.120
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HIGH I DO

02:34:23.187 --> 02:34:25.756
BELIEVE- AND I THINK PART OF IT

02:34:25.823 --> 02:34:28.025
IS BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP

02:34:28.092 --> 02:34:29.493
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:32.663
AND THE TEN. CAMPUS US. ON THAT

02:34:32.730 --> 02:34:34.531
I DO BELIEVE THAT THE REASON

02:34:34.598 --> 02:34:35.933
THIS NUMBER HASN'T GONE DOWN IS

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.302
BECAUSE THE CHANCELLOR'S WANTED

02:34:38.369 --> 02:34:39.470
THEIR FINANCIAL FREEDOM FROM

02:34:39.536 --> 02:34:41.071
THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. AND

02:34:41.138 --> 02:34:44.341
IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES FOR

02:34:44.408 --> 02:34:47.378
FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE- IN FACT

02:34:47.444 --> 02:34:49.446
THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY GREW

02:34:49.513 --> 02:34:52.650
SIGNIFICANTLY IN TERMS OF

02:34:52.716 --> 02:34:54.551
BUDGET AT THE UNIVERSITY WHAT

02:34:54.618 --> 02:34:56.720
IS YOUR OFFICE. THAT'S WHAT WE

02:34:56.787 --> 02:34:58.222
SAW THE BIGGEST INCREASE DURING

02:34:58.288 --> 02:34:59.823
MY- SORT OF EIGHT YEARS

02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:01.358
LEGISLATURE WAS WE SAW AN

02:35:01.425 --> 02:35:03.560
EXPLOSION. IN THE PRESIDENT'S

02:35:03.627 --> 02:35:06.463
OFFICE WITH- ZERO IMPACT ON

02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:10.668
STUDENTS OR FACULTY- SO AGAIN

02:35:10.734 --> 02:35:13.637
MARK MY HOPE IS THAT HE'LL TAKE

02:35:13.704 --> 02:35:16.507
A HARD LOOK AT. FIGURE OUT HOW

02:35:16.573 --> 02:35:18.609
YOUR OFFICE CAN BETTER SERVE

02:35:18.676 --> 02:35:21.045
ON. THE DIFFERENT TEN CAMPUSES

02:35:21.111 --> 02:35:23.947

FIND A WAY TO SUPPORT. THE TEN

02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:30.521
CAMPUSES SO THAT WE COULD.

02:35:30.587 --> 02:35:32.322

BEEN DISCUSSED AND I DO WANT

02:36:04.121 --> 02:36:05.956
TO. DISCUSS THEM IN A PUBLIC

02:36:06.023 --> 02:36:06.757
FORUM BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN

02:36:06.824 --> 02:36:08.826
DISCUSSED IN A PUBLIC FORUM IN

JUST THOSE THINGS THAT WE WORK

02:36:27.945 --> 02:36:29.880

PREDECESSORS. IF MY- CAMPUSES

02:36:47.765 --> 02:36:48.799
THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE THEIR

OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENHANCING

02:37:01.278 --> 02:37:03.080
THE WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY DOES

02:37:03.147 --> 02:37:06.483
THE OFFICE IS NOT THE- THE

02:37:14.525 --> 02:37:15.859
UNDERSTATE THE CHAPTERS WOULD

02:37:15.926 --> 02:37:17.661
FEEL THAT THERE'S A COMPETITION

02:37:17.728 --> 02:37:19.163
BETWEEN THE WORK THAT I'M DOING

02:37:19.229 --> 02:37:20.197
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IF THEY

02:37:20.264 --> 02:37:21.064
DIDN'T FEEL THAT I WAS A-

02:37:21.131 --> 02:37:23.200
PARTNER. AT HELPING THEM TO DO

02:37:23.267 --> 02:37:24.935
THAT THEN I WOULD. SAY THAT WE

02:37:25.002 --> 02:37:31.475

02:43:44.714 --> 02:43:46.750
OUR APPLICATIONS WERE DOWN HAVE

02:43:46.816 --> 02:43:50.487
BEEN DOWN SO FAR BY ABOUT 5%

02:43:50.554 --> 02:43:52.389
NOW IT'S A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO

02:43:52.455 --> 02:43:53.890
PREDICT THAT THAT'S GOING TO

02:43:53.957 --> 02:43:56.293
LEAD TO A LOWER ENROLLMENT. IT

02:43:56.359 --> 02:43:58.929
WILL ALL DEPEND UPON- OUR OUR

02:43:58.995 --> 02:44:00.664
YIELD RATES AND WE'RE BEING

02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:03.466
VERY AGGRESSIVE AND- GETTING

02:44:03.533 --> 02:44:05.202
MORE STUDENTS TO APPLY I DON'T

02:44:05.268 --> 02:44:06.403
KNOW IF YOU SAW THE WASHINGTON

02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:08.471
POST ARTICLE OVER THE WEEKEND

02:44:08.538 --> 02:44:10.574
BUT IT SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE OF

02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:12.542
THE PANDEMIC SOME STUDENTS ARE

02:44:12.609 --> 02:44:13.877
ARE NOT MEETING THE USUAL

02:44:13.944 --> 02:44:16.046
DEADLINES AND I COMPLETELY

02:44:16.112 --> 02:44:18.415
UNDERSTAND THAT- SO WE- FLEXED

02:44:18.481 --> 02:44:20.684
THEIR- AND I DO BELIEVE WILL

02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:23.320
PICK UP MORE APPLICATIONS. AND

02:44:23.386 --> 02:44:24.988
MY HOPE IS THAT BY THE TIME WE

02:44:25.055 --> 02:44:26.890
GET TO THE FALL IN THE

02:44:26.957 --> 02:44:29.893
ENROLLMENT PART- THAT WILL BE

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:31.861
EITHER AT OR SOMEWHERE NEAR

02:44:31.928 --> 02:44:34.164
WHERE WE WERE- LAST YEAR LAST

02:44:34.231 --> 02:44:36.633
FALL- AND THEN OVER TIME I'D

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:38.802
LIKE TO. ALONG WITH ALL OF YOU

02:44:38.868 --> 02:44:40.570
TRY TO GROW THOSE ENROLLMENTS I

02:44:40.637 --> 02:44:42.839
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR

02:44:42.906 --> 02:44:44.474
US TO EDUCATE MORE CALIFORNIANS

02:44:44.541 --> 02:44:46.076
AND GET THEIR DEGREES AND HELP

02:44:46.142 --> 02:44:47.944

02:44:56.853 --> 02:44:58.221
IN YOUR YIELD EFFORTS BECAUSE

OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO ENSURE.

02:45:00.056 --> 02:45:01.224
THAT AS MANY PEOPLE CAN YOU

02:45:01.291 --> 02:45:02.659
KNOW WHO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:45:02.726 --> 02:45:06.363
YOU KNOW WHO WHAT. THE

02:45:06.429 --> 02:45:06.863
OPPORTUNITY CAN GET THE

02:45:06.930 --> 02:45:07.731
OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL. WELL IT

02:45:07.797 --> 02:45:08.965
AS A MAN WERE CONTINUE TO BE

02:45:09.032 --> 02:45:10.967
VERY AGGRESSIVE EACH CAMPUS

02:45:11.034 --> 02:45:12.168
THROUGH OUR ADMISSIONS OFFICE

02:45:12.235 --> 02:45:14.671
IS DOING A LOT OF VIRTUAL.

02:45:14.738 --> 02:45:16.806
CONNECTIONS THERE ARE A COUPLE

02:45:16.873 --> 02:45:19.175
WAYS THE STATE CAN BE HELPFUL-

02:45:19.242 --> 02:45:21.111
ONE IS TO WORK WITH US TO GET

02:45:21.177 --> 02:45:23.246
OUR FOLKS VACCINATED AS-

02:45:23.313 --> 02:45:24.714
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I THINK A

02:45:24.781 --> 02:45:26.016
LOT OF STUDENTS ARE JUST.

02:45:26.082 --> 02:45:28.118
FRANKLY TIRED OF THE VIRTUAL

02:45:28.184 --> 02:45:30.186
EDUCATION AND- SOME MIGHT BE

02:45:30.253 --> 02:45:31.721
SAYING WELL I'LL WAIT A LITTLE

02:45:31.788 --> 02:45:34.090
WHILE PERHAPS SO. I THINK IF WE

02:45:34.157 --> 02:45:36.226
CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER

02:45:36.293 --> 02:45:38.028
SO THAT AS MANY STUDENTS AS

02:45:38.094 --> 02:45:40.330
POSSIBLE CAN BE ON CAMPUS. IN

02:45:40.397 --> 02:45:42.532
THE FALL THAT THAT WILL BE. A

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:45.001
TERRIFIC AND THEN. TO MAKE SURE

02:45:45.068 --> 02:45:46.970
WE ALL HAVE THE FUNDING THAT WE

02:45:47.037 --> 02:45:48.805
NEED TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS.

02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:50.273
WHERE THEY'RE AT AND THE

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.375
FEDERAL MONEY WILL HELP US WITH

02:45:52.442 --> 02:45:53.576
SOME OF THE EMERGENCY ISSUES

02:45:53.643 --> 02:45:56.079
BUT- THE CORE OPERATING BUDGETS

02:45:56.146 --> 02:45:58.581
THAT WE NEED. TO SERVE ALL OF

02:45:58.648 --> 02:45:59.816

LONGER ROAD TO TRAVEL AND-

02:46:05.955 --> 02:46:07.424
WHERE YOU KNOW MY JOB AS

02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:08.625

QUALITY DEGREE AND TO ELIMINATE

02:46:16.599 --> 02:46:18.068

02:48:58.795 --> 02:49:00.430
FINALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE

THAT WE SEE COMING DOWN THE

02:49:13.776 --> 02:49:17.447
PIKE- IS IT IS ENROLLMENT FOR

02:49:17.514 --> 02:49:18.648

DOWNTURN IT IS- IT OFTENTIMES

02:49:32.395 --> 02:49:35.131
YOU DO SEE- YOU KNOW THAT.

02:49:35.198 --> 02:49:35.999
USUALLY DURING A DOWNTURN YOU

RIGHT NOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:49:38.735 --> 02:49:40.136

CHIANG- I THINK. YOU KNOW THIS

02:49:51.848 --> 02:49:55.218
IS NOT A NORMAL DOWNTURN THAT

02:49:55.285 --> 02:49:57.320
WERE USED TO SEEING- FIRST OF

02:49:57.387 --> 02:49:59.756
ALL- WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS NOT

02:49:59.822 --> 02:50:04.060
JUST A DOWNTURN BUT A DIRECT-

02:50:04.127 --> 02:50:06.462
CHALLENGE TO OUR STUDENTS AND

02:50:06.529 --> 02:50:10.400
THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO

02:50:10.466 --> 02:50:12.001
TWO JOBS THAT ALLOW THEM TO

02:50:12.068 --> 02:50:14.337
MAKE ENDS MEET. AND SO MANY OF

02:50:14.404 --> 02:50:15.972
THEM HAVE HAD REDUCED HOURS OR

02:50:16.039 --> 02:50:18.241
OF LOST THEIR JOBS- THE

02:50:18.308 --> 02:50:19.509
COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE HAVE

02:50:19.576 --> 02:50:20.710
BEEN HIT THE HARDEST BY THE

02:50:20.777 --> 02:50:23.146
PANDEMIC- CERTAINLY THE HEALTH

02:50:23.212 --> 02:50:25.114
OUTCOMES ECONOMIC OUTCOMES THE

02:50:25.181 --> 02:50:27.183
RACIAL RECKONING SO THOSE THESE

02:50:27.250 --> 02:50:28.451
ARE CHALLENGES FOR OUR STUDENTS

02:50:28.518 --> 02:50:31.154
AND OUR STUDENTS TO HEART LIKE-

02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:33.957
CSU OR UC WHERE THEY ARE

02:50:34.023 --> 02:50:36.893
ADMITTED- TO. CAMPUS WE HAVE

02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:38.561
OPEN ENROLLMENT SO THEY COME

02:50:38.628 --> 02:50:41.064
AND THEY GO. A AND WE TRY TO BE

02:50:41.130 --> 02:50:42.932
AS ACCESSIBLE TO THEM IT'S

02:50:42.999 --> 02:50:44.734
POSSIBLE THAT ALSO MEANS THAT.

02:50:44.801 --> 02:50:47.437
AS SOON AS THEY'RE HIT BY-

02:50:47.503 --> 02:50:50.406
ECONOMIC ISSUES- THEY TEND TO

02:50:50.473 --> 02:50:51.708
SCALE BACK SO OUR BIGGEST

02:50:51.774 --> 02:50:53.576
ISSUES ARE ARE THREE THINGS.

02:50:53.643 --> 02:50:55.044
THAT YOU CAN BE HELPFUL WITHIN

02:50:55.111 --> 02:50:57.080
YOU HAPPEN HELP WITH ONE IS.

IT'S A NINE IT'S A NON WINNER

02:58:13.883 --> 02:58:15.584
FOR YOU ONE FOR POLITICS THE

02:58:15.651 --> 02:58:17.787
LEGISLATURE HUNTER PERCENT DOES

02:58:17.853 --> 02:58:19.755
NOT AGREE WITH YOU. ALL OF US

02:58:19.822 --> 02:58:21.957
GET A COMMENTS IN OUR DISTRICTS

02:58:22.024 --> 02:58:24.160
ABOUT PEOPLE WITH A FOUR POINT

02:58:24.226 --> 02:58:25.261
THREE WHO CAN'T GET INTO THEIR

02:58:25.327 --> 02:58:28.330
UC CAMPUS BUT THEY SEE STUDENTS

02:58:28.397 --> 02:58:29.932
WHO ARE INTERNATIONAL OR

02:58:29.999 --> 02:58:31.400
WEALTHY OUT OF STATERS TAKING

02:58:31.467 --> 02:58:33.402
THOSE SEATS. AND MISTER LEE

02:58:33.469 --> 02:58:35.204
JUST LEFT BUT I WILL NOTE THAT

02:58:35.271 --> 02:58:36.005
THAT DIDN'T AND MOST

02:58:36.072 --> 02:58:38.140
IMPORTANTLY MATH IS NOT ON YOUR

02:58:38.207 --> 02:58:40.576
SIDE BECAUSE THAT NUMBER CHAU

02:58:40.643 --> 02:58:42.611
HAS SOMEONE EVER TEAM NOTED.

02:58:42.678 --> 02:58:44.346
THAT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WHEN

02:58:44.413 --> 02:58:46.615
WE GAVE YOU SEE MORE MONEY WE

02:58:46.682 --> 02:58:48.417
SAW FEWER CALIFORNIA'S FOR

02:58:48.484 --> 02:58:51.654
EXAMPLE A UC DAVIS I WAS ASKING

02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:53.389
MISTER LEE WHEN HE GRADUATED

02:58:53.456 --> 02:58:56.292
HIGH SCHOOL HE SAID TWO

02:58:56.358 --> 02:58:57.093
THOUSAND THIRTEEN SO WHEN HE

02:58:57.159 --> 02:58:58.461
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THINKING

02:58:58.527 --> 02:59:00.729
ABOUT UC DAVIS LET'S SAY TWO

02:59:00.796 --> 02:59:02.198
THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE. TO THE

02:59:02.264 --> 02:59:05.334
YEAR THAT HE GRADUATED TWENTY

02:59:05.401 --> 02:59:06.001
SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER OF

02:59:06.068 --> 02:59:08.471
INTERNATIONAL AN OUT OF STATE

02:59:08.537 --> 02:59:10.139
STUDENTS AT UC DAVIS DOUBLED

02:59:10.206 --> 02:59:13.175
FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO

02:59:13.242 --> 02:59:13.843
FIVE THOUSAND AND THE NUMBER OF

02:59:13.909 --> 02:59:15.744
STUDENTS FROM CALIFORNIA WENT

02:59:15.811 --> 02:59:18.314
DOWN. SO THINK ABOUT THAT FEWER

02:59:18.380 --> 02:59:21.150
CALIFORNIANS DOUBLE THE AMOUNT

02:59:21.217 --> 02:59:24.220
OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS ALL IN

02:59:24.286 --> 02:59:26.956
THAT PERIOD WHEN WE WERE GIVING

02:59:27.022 --> 02:59:29.625
SIX NICK SIGNIFICANT INCREASES.

02:59:29.692 --> 02:59:30.860
TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:59:30.926 --> 02:59:33.696
FROM THE GENERAL FUND GRANTED I

02:59:33.762 --> 02:59:35.231
THINK YOU PUT THIS ISSUE TO BED

02:59:35.297 --> 02:59:36.799
FOR A BIT THE SENATE AS YOU NOW

02:59:36.866 --> 02:59:38.667
WANTS TO PUT THAT NUMBER DOWN I

02:59:38.734 --> 02:59:39.668
KNOW MR TANG TALKED ABOUT BRING

02:59:39.735 --> 02:59:41.337
IT DOWN BUT- BY DOING THAT WE

02:59:41.403 --> 02:59:42.471
HAVE TO PUT ANOTHER POT OF

02:59:42.538 --> 02:59:44.573
MONEY ON GOING. TO SUPPLANT

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:45.608
THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD IN A

02:59:45.674 --> 02:59:48.577
PERFECT WORLD BUT I THINK THAT

02:59:48.644 --> 02:59:50.012
THE URGE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH

02:59:50.079 --> 02:59:52.515
THIS IS IT IS NOT GOING TO

02:59:52.581 --> 02:59:54.450
HAPPEN- WE WOULD LIKE SOME OF

02:59:54.517 --> 02:59:56.919
THE OTHER CAMPUSES THAT AREN'T

02:59:56.986 --> 03:00:02.758
THERE LIKE. MERCED IN RIVERSIDE.

03:00:02.825 --> 03:00:03.359
NOW THERE'S NOT TO COME CLOSE

03:00:03.425 --> 03:00:04.026
TO THAT EIGHTEEN FIRST. REALIZE

03:00:04.093 --> 03:00:04.593
YOU CAN'T THE GENIE IN THE

03:00:04.660 --> 03:00:06.262
BOTTLE WITH THE OTHER ONES

03:00:06.328 --> 03:00:08.330
ABOVE- BUT CERTAINLY THAT IS

03:00:08.397 --> 03:00:09.698
THE ISSUE THAT IS VERY VERY

03:00:09.765 --> 03:00:11.400
CONCERNING TO US BECAUSE- WE

03:00:11.467 --> 03:00:12.801
GOT OUR DISTRICTS THAT SO WE

03:00:12.868 --> 03:00:14.737

ACCESS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION

03:00:30.519 --> 03:00:32.154

03:32:19.026 --> 03:32:19.660
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEIR

03:32:19.726 --> 03:32:21.495
FINANCIAL HARDSHIP CAUSED BY

03:32:21.562 --> 03:32:23.297
THE INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

03:32:23.363 --> 03:32:25.466
DUE TO THE PANDEMIC I THINK

03:32:25.532 --> 03:32:27.067
THAT IF WE CAN USE FINANCIAL

03:32:27.134 --> 03:32:28.502

03:32:42.182 --> 03:32:43.851
MAJOR CONCERN I HAVE IS FOR

03:32:43.917 --> 03:32:45.352
HOUSING AT THE COST OF LIVING

03:32:45.419 --> 03:32:46.353

03:32:46.420 --> 03:32:48.188
DISPROPORTIONATE TO OUR STATE'S

03:32:48.255 --> 03:32:50.424
