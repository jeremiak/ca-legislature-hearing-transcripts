REQUESTS FOR THOSE WITH.

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:32.858
DISABILITIES AND MY QUESTION IS

00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:34.760
THIS I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:37.063

STATE GOVERNMENT VIS A VIS THE

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:56.949
DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.918
BETTER FOR QUESTION IS IT'S A

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:00.119
DIFFICULT QUESTION BUT IT'S

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:03.022
FAIR LET ME LET ME. BECAUSE

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:04.790
WHAT I'VE SEEN AND OBSERVED IS

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:07.526
WE HAVE LOWER LEVEL OF

00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:09.261
EMPLOYEES WHO OFTENTIMES OR

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:11.831
THE- OR THE SCREENING DEVICE

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:14.366
FOR AEO COMPLAINTS WE HAVE

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:17.203
SUPERVISORS WHO PERHAPS. MAYBE

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:18.404
THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED BUT MAYBE

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:20.840
NOT ENOUGH WHO ARE MAKING

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:22.908
DECISIONS ON ISSUES THAT HAVE

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:25.978
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL OF

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:26.512

CALIFORNIA. AND YOU CAN TRACK

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.750
THOSE THINGS BUT YOUR PEOPLE

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:34.019
ARE NOT IN THE DECISION MAKING

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:36.155
EQUATION AND SO THERE'S NO WAY

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:37.957
TO PREVENT OR MITIGATE THE

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:39.625

GETTING. TO WITH MY QUESTION.

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:45.898
SO I THINK A ONE THING THAT

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:46.465
MAKES THAT DIFFICULT IN THE

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:46.966

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:12.585
THE TICKET ESTHER FEE. THAT

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:13.719
THAT IS SO LET ME JUST- SO DID

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:15.087
THE HR PROFESSIONALS IN AGENTS

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:15.654

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:17.890
KNOW THEY REPORT TO THE AGENCY

HAD OR A SUPERVISOR UNDERNEATH

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:19.858
THE AGENCY HAS SO THAT'S THE

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:20.726
DICHOTOMY IN THE ISSUE THAT

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:21.360
WE'VE HAD IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:23.295
DOTTED LINE RESPONSIBILITY IS A

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:24.063
FOUR AS OPPOSED TO SELL IN LINE

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:26.165
SUPERVISION. AND RESPONSIBILITY

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.600
HAS BEEN ADDED DISCUSSION OF

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:31.570
SHIFTING THE WAY HR

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:34.073
PROFESSIONALS CERTAINLY THE HR

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:35.474
MANAGERS IN AN AGENCY. THEY

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.010
WERE DISCUSSION HAVING THOSE

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:38.677
INDIVIDUALS REPORT DIRECTLY TO

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.246
CAL HR AND TAKE THEM OUT FROM

UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:45.084
AGENCY HEADS AND SUPERVISORS

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.418
PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:47.987
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE OF

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.788
FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES TO THE

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:51.590
STATE SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:54.426
I THINK AS IT RELATES TO MOST

00:14:54.493 --> 00:14:55.995
HR FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD BE VERY

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.930
HARD TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE OF

00:14:57.997 --> 00:15:01.166
THE SIZE AND THE COMPLEXITY OF-

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.534
THE OPERATIONS OF THOSE STATE

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:04.937
DEPARTMENT SO AS I THINK ABOUT

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:06.739
WHAT MY JOB IS AND THE

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:08.874
KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR FOLKS HAVE I

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.576
THINK IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.878
HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE TAKING

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:13.912
OVER. ALL OF THE HIRING FOR A

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:16.348

PERSONAL SHOPPER WELL I'M NOT

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:20.386
SUGGESTING THAT WHAT I'M

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:21.420
SUGGESTING IS THERE A WAY FOR

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:23.389
AN HR PROFESSIONAL EMBEDDED IN

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:26.492

AN ISSUE OR SITUATION GOING ON

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:36.201
IN A PROTECTED WAY SO THAT WE

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:37.670
KNOW AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:40.072
INSIDE THE H. R. HIERARCHY IT'S

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:42.975
SOMETHING IS AMISS. IN CALTRANS

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:44.243

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.612
PICK AN AGENCY SO I DO THINK

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:47.780

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:58.924
WE'RE BEING REQUESTED WHO SETS

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:00.392
THE COMPARABLES IN THE

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.527
COMPENSATION STUDY. I'M I

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:05.263
BELIEVE WE DO I AM I'M IF I'M

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.931
WRONG I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON A

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:07.599
CLARIFICATION BUT I BELIEVE WE

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:10.802
DO. THAT'S I'M JUST CURIOUS AND

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:11.403
YOU COULDN'T PROVE IT BY MAYES

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.805
SO THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. WITH

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:15.140
RESPECT TO COMPENSATION STUDIES

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:16.775
THAN. WHICH SHOULD WE EVER BE

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:20.379
FACED WITH A. SOMETHING OTHER

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.347
THAN A COST OF LIVING INCREASE

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:23.982
IN A AND M. O. U. WITHOUT A

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:25.684
COMPENSATION STUDY TO BACK UP

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:28.687
THE INCREASE. I MEAN I THINK

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:30.589
THAT HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE THERE

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.090
HAVE BEEN DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:35.460
METHODOLOGIES OR- WHETHER- PAST

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:38.563
STUDIES WERE. REALLY

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.599
REPRESENTING THE TYPE OF A

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:41.933
CLASSIFICATION IS I THINK THAT

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.002
THAT HAS HAPPENED. IN CASES

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:45.837
WHERE THE CLASSIFICATION IS

00:21:45.904 --> 00:21:46.705
VERY UNIQUE TO STATE SERVICE

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:48.607
AND THERE REALLY- IT'S MUCH

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:49.574
HARDER TO FIND TRUE

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:54.312
COMPARABLES- I THINK THAT NOT.

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:56.548
NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE PAST I

00:21:56.615 --> 00:22:00.218
WOULD LIKE TO- HAVE A PROCESS

00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:00.852
WHERE WE DON'T EVER ASK YOU TO

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:01.920
DO THAT WERE YOU ALWAYS HAVE

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.822
THAT DATA. BUT AT THE SAME TIME

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:04.823
I WOULD SAY THERE MIGHT BE

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.893
TIMES WHERE THERE ARE THERE ARE

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:09.594
OTHER DATA SETS THAT WE LOOK AT

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:10.028
AND THERE ARE OTHER

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:11.697
JUSTIFICATIONS FOR WHAT WE

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.732
BRING TO THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:17.102
RATIFY AND- THERE IS- WE WANT

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.070
TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS

00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:19.938
POSSIBLE ABOUT WHAT THAT IS SO

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:22.107
IF IT ISN'T A SALARY SURVEY

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:23.742
THAT. RESULTED IN A PARTICULAR

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:25.777
A PAY INCREASE WE WOULD BE

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.879
HAPPY TO GO THROUGH ALL THE

00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:28.480
REASONS WHY WE AGE DO WE REACH

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:31.216
THAT CONCLUSION. WELL I WANT TO

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:33.685

REFLECTED ON THIS OPPORTUNITY

00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:33.345
COMING UP AND LEAVING THAT

00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:34.980
POSITION EARLY IT WAS A TERM TO

00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:37.582
POSITION AND I- I HAD TO.

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:42.888
DECIDE WHETHER THAT MADE SENSE-

00:23:42.954 --> 00:23:44.189
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:46.124
STRONGLY. POSITION AND FOCUSED.

00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:46.725
THERE WAS REALLY ESTABLISHING

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:47.325
THE INDEPENDENCE OF TH OFFICE

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:48.593
AND HOW IT MIGHT OPERATE WITH

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.861
THE AGENCY SECRETARY THE

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:52.364
DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR. BUT WHAT I

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.066
FELT STRONGLY WAS THAT THE-

00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:56.434
THE- FOR THAT FONG THAT OUR

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:57.803
OFFICE TO FUNCTION WELL IS TO

00:23:57.869 --> 00:23:58.436
HAVE A REALLY STRONG

00:23:58.503 --> 00:24:00.472
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE FOLKS.

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:03.308
AND SENSE AT THAT POINT I HAD A

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:04.910
STRONG SENSE THAT THOSE WERE

00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:06.745
GOING TO BE ALL NEW PEOPLE. IT

00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:07.512
MADE SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:09.548
GOOD FOR ME TO LEAVE A TIME TO

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:11.850
SELECT ALL OF THOSE NEW PEOPLE

00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:14.719
FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK. WHAT IT

00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:16.188
HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO ME TO

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:17.656
BE IN A LARGE DEPARTMENT EVEN

00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:18.723
FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.226
SEE THE- IN TERMS OF SOME OF

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:22.260
THE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:23.061
ABOUT THE LENGTH OF TIME IT

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:25.764
TAKES TO HIRE. PEOPLE OR- SOME

00:24:25.831 --> 00:24:29.000
OF THAT PROCESSES. TO IS TO BE

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:30.168
IN A LARGE DEPARTMENT AND JUST

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:32.003
KIND OF SEE SOME OF THE THINGS

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.471
THAT CAUSE THE TIME TO STRETCH

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:36.641
IT WAS VERY HELPFUL- I DON'T

00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:38.143
THINK. I'D I NEVER I HAVEN'T

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.010
SEEN ANYTHING IN THAT

00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:40.178
DEPARTMENT THAT'S DIFFERENT

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:40.946
THAN ANYWHERE ELSE I THINK

00:24:41.012 --> 00:24:42.581
EVERYONE IS STRUGGLING WITH

00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:44.249
TRYING TO ATTRACT THE BEST

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:46.284
CANDIDATES AND GET THE ONES

00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:47.552
THAT ARE THE BEST IN AS QUICKLY

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:49.688
AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOSING THEM

00:24:49.754 --> 00:24:52.490
SOMEWHERE ELSE- A LOT OF. THE

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:54.326
STEAM IT WAS COMING UP IN MANY

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:55.560
CLASSIFICATIONS ACROSS MANY

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:56.962
DEPARTMENTS WHICH IS LOCAL

00:24:57.028 --> 00:24:58.964
AGENCIES ARE PAYING MUCH MORE

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.565
THAN THE STATE FOR MANY OF OUR

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:02.834
JOBS- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.536
I'D- I THINK EVERY STATE

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:06.171
DEPARTMENT IS FACING AN- AND-

00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:06.738
THAT. MY EXPERIENCE THERE AS

00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:11.509
WELL. THE SELECTION. YEAH A

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:15.780
SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM

CONGRATULATIONS I APPRECIATED

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.786
THE TIME WE HAD TO REVIEW MANY

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.355
OF THESE ISSUES IN MY OFFICE

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:26.091
EARLIER TODAY I DO WANT TO

00:25:26.157 --> 00:25:26.725
RETURN TO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:28.260
THE PRO TEM ASKED ABOUT

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:29.828
SPECIFICALLY AROUND SEXUAL

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:31.596
HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:32.931
THERE WERE MEDIA REPORTS

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:34.966
INDICATING THAT AS MANY AS

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:38.036
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SUPERSTORE ILL.

00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:39.337
NOW IN CALIFORNIA HAD NOT

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:41.106
RECEIVED THE TRAINING CAN YOU

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:43.074
GIVE US A PROGRESS REPORT ON

00:25:43.141 --> 00:25:44.476
THAT AND WHAT STEPS ARE BEING

00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:47.812
TAKEN. TO ASSURE THE PEOPLE IN

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.414
PARTICULARLY IN SUPERVISORIAL

00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:51.116
POSITIONS I KNOW THAT WE ALSO

00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:53.485
NOW REQUIRE ALL EMPLOYEES BUT-

00:25:53.551 --> 00:25:54.986
FOR SUPERVISORS AGAIN TO

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:57.355
PROTECT AGAINST STATE

00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:59.591
LIABILITY. THAT TRAINING SEEMS

00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:02.694
IMPERATIVE SO I DO- THERE WERE

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.796
MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT- AUDITS

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.464
THAT HAD OCCURRED I THINK THAT

00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:07.666
INFORMATION CAME OUT RIGHT

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:08.233
AROUND THE TIME THAT I WAS

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.168
COMING ON BOARD I'D I DO

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:11.736
BELIEVE THAT AND FOLLOW UP-

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:14.406
REVIEWS OF THE DATA- THE GAP

00:26:14.472 --> 00:26:15.974
BETWEEN WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.709
AND NOT TRAINED. WAS WAS

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:18.643
SMALLER THAN ORIGINALLY

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.245
REPORTED AND LARGELY HAD TO DO

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:22.480
WITH- HOW WHAT PEOPLE WERE

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:24.049
RESERVE REPORTING AS NON

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:26.184
COMPLIANCE- I KNOW SPEAKING

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:27.886
FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN THE

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:29.688
DEPARTMENT. IF WE HAD EMPLOYEES

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:32.357
WHO ARE ON MEDICAL LEAVE FOR

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:33.925
FAMILY LEAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT

00:26:33.992 --> 00:26:35.660
IF THE TIME OF WHICH IS THE

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:38.763
WINNER OF THEIR TRAINING COMES

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:39.831
UP DURING THE TIME THAT SOMEONE

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.366
ASKS YOU. IS EVERYBODY TRAINED

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:41.900
YOU WOULD SHOW THEM IS NOT

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:43.234
TRAINED BUT THEY'RE NOT LIKELY

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:44.536
WORK IN YOUR OFFICE AT THAT

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:47.138
TIME AND THE EXPECTATION WOULD

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:49.441
BE AS SOON AS A RETURN TO WORK

00:26:49.507 --> 00:26:51.643
THAT TO PRIORITY TO GET THEM.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:55.046
BACK ON THEIR THINGS GOT. SO I

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:58.149
SAID THE- WORDS OF PEOPLE WHO

00:26:58.216 --> 00:26:59.985
HAD NOT BEEN TRAINED AND THEN-

00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.786
DID HOWEVER IT WAS STILL NOT AT

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:02.687
FULL COMPLIANCE AD I THINK

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:06.992
THAT- THAT WAS A LARGE PART OF.

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:08.927
A MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR WANTED

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:13.798
TO. THAT ALL. DEPARTMENT YOUR

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:15.300
SHIP THAT WAS HOW IMPORTANT IS

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:15.900
TO ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL COMPLY.

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:20.772
HOW CRITICAL IT TO THE- TO NOT

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:21.406
ONLY CREATE IN THE ENVIRONMENT

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:22.007
THAT WE WANT TO CREATE FOR OUR

00:27:22.073 --> 00:27:22.640
EMPLOYEES AND PROTECTING THEM

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:23.174
BUT ALSO TO CREATING THE

00:27:23.241 --> 00:27:23.775
ENVIRONMENT WE WANT SO THAT

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:27.045
PEOPLE WANT TO COME WORK HERE

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:29.714
SO THE NEW PEOPLE THINK OF US

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:30.315
AS THE EMPLOYER OF CHOICE AND

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:32.884
WANT TO BE WORK. STATES THAT

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:34.152
TOPIC IS LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:36.287
ISSUES ONE BEING HOW WE DELIVER

00:27:36.354 --> 00:27:38.089
THE TRAINING ARE THERE MORE

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:39.124
EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAYS TO

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.659
MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS TRAINED-

00:27:41.726 --> 00:27:44.062
THEY ARE LOOKING AT- COMPLIANCE

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:46.097
TOOLS AS WERE CALLING THEM AND

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.766
I THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THE

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:48.633
WAYS IN WHICH THE

BUT THE TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:37.449
IS A SYSTEM THAT DOES THAT ON

00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:38.049
SEXUAL HARASSMENT WELL ON THAT

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:39.484

COMPLIANCE ON THAT PARTICULAR

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:10.014

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:11.382
THROUGH THE AGENCY LEVEL RATHER

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:13.384
THAN THROUGH CALLIE CHAR. I

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:14.686
WOULD SAY THAT KELLY CHARTERS

ROLE IN IN THE OVERSIGHT OF

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:19.257
THAT- WOULD COME INTO PLAY TO

00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:20.692
THE EXTENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:29:20.758 --> 00:29:23.161
WAS NOT- WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:25.730
OR SEEM TO HAVE SOME- REAL

00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:28.199
BARRIER TO FOLLOWING THE STATE

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:30.568
POLICY THAT MAY PLAY INTO

00:29:30.635 --> 00:29:32.470
HAVING THEIR DELEGATION REMOVED

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:34.105
IN WHICH CASE MAYBE WE WOULD

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:36.641
HAVE MORE OF A ROLE OF-

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:38.409
INSURING THAT TRAINING. BUT

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:40.445
GENERALLY SPEAKING THE LIKE I

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:43.214

OF. CREATING THE CULTURE WE

00:29:58.363 --> 00:29:59.964

00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:02.634
SUBSIDIARY ISSUE THAT WE GET TO

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.601

MINT. YES ABSOLUTELY SENATOR.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.732
JUST OF JUST A FOLLOW UP ON MY

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.034
ORIGINAL POINT HAVING TO DO

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.435
WITH CHAIN OF COMMAND AND

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:39.904
CONTROL AND QUALITY CONTROL.

00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:41.139
JUST TO GET AN IDEA I DON'T

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.041
KNOW IF YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:44.576
WAY THE STATE IS STRUCTURED IN

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:47.512
THE HR. ARENA THESE DAYS BUT

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:50.515
HOW MANY SENIOR HR MANAGERS OR

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:53.551
DIRECTORS ARE THERE. FOLKS WHO

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:55.687
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AGENCY OR

00:30:55.753 --> 00:30:57.889
DEPARTMENT HR FUNCTIONS IN

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:02.026
STATE GOVERNMENT. IS AT A

00:31:02.093 --> 00:31:04.128
HUNDRED WELL AT I WOULD SAY. I

00:31:04.195 --> 00:31:08.533
THINK EVERY DEPARTMENT OF-

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.268
CONSEQUENTIAL SIZE SO THERE ARE

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:12.170
A FEW DEPARTMENTS AND BOARDS

00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:13.404
THE OUTER THE HAVE VERY VERY

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:15.540
TINY STAFF AND THEY MAYBE HAVE

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:17.642
THEIR AGENCY HELPING THEM WITH

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.377
HR BUT ANY DEPARTMENT OF SIZE

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:21.846
WOULD HAVE AN HR DIRECTOR- I

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:22.914
THINK THAT'S PRETTY CALMLY

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:25.116
FIELD POSITION ON THAT PERSON

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:26.184
MAY OR MAY NOT BE REPORTING TO

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:28.953
A KIND OF AN ADMIN CHIEF- WHO

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.055
WOULD ALSO HAVE A PRETTY

00:31:31.122 --> 00:31:32.991
SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN H. R.

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:36.361
ISSUES AND THEN UNDERNEATH THE-

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:39.497
HR DIRECTOR THERE WOULD LIKELY

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.599
BE- PEOPLE AT THE SENIOR

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:44.068
MANAGEMENT LEVEL WHO HAVE. A

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:45.069
DIFFERENT KIND OF CATEGORY OF

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:47.171
AREAS THEY MIGHT RESPOND FOR

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:49.774
THE E. MIGHT BE ONE. HIRING

00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:50.375
MIGHT BE ANOTHER PERFORMANCE

00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:51.476
MANAGEMENT ANOTHER SO I DON'T

00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:53.177
HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER WE CAN

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:53.645
CERTAINLY GET YOU MORE

00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:54.545
INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBERS

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:58.082
BUT- I THINK. IN ORDER FOR A

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:59.450
STATE SERVICE TO FUNCTION THE

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:02.086
WAY IT FUNCTIONS TODAY WITH THE

00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:03.454
LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY THE CIVIL

00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:06.758
SERVICE RULES- EACH DEPARTMENT

00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.192
REALLY HAS A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:11.963
HR FUNCTION. INTERNALLY MY

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:12.430
CONCERN MY CONCERN IS

00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:14.699
STANDARDIZED QUALITY. AND I'M

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.434
CONCERNED THAT THEIR WIDE

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:18.903
VARIATIONS OF QUALITY EVEN

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.606
AMONG THE LARGER AGENCIES AND

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:22.140
DEPARTMENTS I THINK THAT'S

00:32:22.206 --> 00:32:25.543
ABSOLUTELY AND SOMEHOW. WE HAVE

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.945
TO ENGAGE IN AN EARLIER POINT

00:32:28.012 --> 00:32:30.214

TOWARD WHICH IS TRACKING AND

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.886
CATCHING THE STUFF AT THE

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:37.789
BACKEND WE NEED TO ENGAGE AT

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:39.490
THE FRONT END WE NEED TO GET A

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:40.992
BETTER DEAL ON STANDARD. SURE

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.394
QUALITY AND CAN- IN OUR SYSTEM.

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.163
AND I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE

00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:48.166
THE ANSWER FOR THAT BUT- JUST

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:49.534
TO REITERATE MY EARLIER POINT A

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.035

EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND NOT

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:41.391
ONLY NEEDED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR

00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:43.961
BUT WE HAD TO MAKE REAL SERIOUS

00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:45.662

AUDITING STAFF THEY HAVE

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:09.186
CLAMPED DOWN. IN ONE OF THE

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:10.153

OUR NEW PRESIDENT IS AS A DEEP

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:28.572
DEEP CONVICTION. THAT BECAUSE

DAKOTA. EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.538

00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:33.764
FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THEY

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.232
HAVE NOTHING. SO WE MAKE

00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:36.867

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:14.137
STATE THAT SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:18.575

WHAT I THINK WE ARE BOTH SAYING

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:22.979
AND SOME ERROR HOW I'M HEARING

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:26.282
IT. WE DO HAVE EXTENSIONS BUT

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:28.184
ARE THEY SIMPLY IN PLACES WHERE

00:56:28.251 --> 00:56:29.419
CITIES AND REGIONS WHERE

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:30.987
THEY'RE ALREADY A BIG- BRICK

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.622
AND MORTAR CAMPUS. AND I THINK

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:33.723
WHAT WE CAN DO A STAFF IS

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:36.159
IMMEDIATELY GET- THIS FULL

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:38.261

OUR MAP BUT OUR LIST OF

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:42.165
EXTENSION- INSTITUTIONS. BUT

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:43.433
WHERE THERE ARE NONE WHAT

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.069
HAPPENS IS- OUR YOUNG PEOPLE OR

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:48.772
RESUME OURS THEY LEAVE. AND

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:57.080
CSU PROVIDES IT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:59.015

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:33.596
INSTITUTION OF FLOAT BUT TO

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:34.597

THE SYSTEM AS METRICS AND I

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:54.784
