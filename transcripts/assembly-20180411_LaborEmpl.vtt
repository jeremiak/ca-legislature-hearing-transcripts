IS ALSO HURTS THE STATE I MOST

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:17.146 region:rollup2
OFTEN THE STATE LOSES OUT ON TAX

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:19.449 region:rollup2

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:20.950 region:rollup2
INJURED ON THE JOB.

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:21.651 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.553 region:rollup2

PREMIUM FRAUD.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:38.167 region:rollup2
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THIS FRAUD

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:40.336 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE TOTALED SEVEN

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:41.304 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS. AND ALSO

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:42.839 region:rollup2
WORKERS WERE LEFT WITH

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:43.439 region:rollup2

JOB.

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:46.509 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE MANY EMPLOYERS

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:48.144 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH THE

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:49.312 region:rollup2
SAME PRACTICE AND SEE GETTING

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:50.847 region:rollup2

PARTNER WITH AGENCIES ON THE

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.451 region:rollup2
TYPES OF CASES. BUT WE STILL

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.786 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:58.554 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS WILL CONTINUE TO MISS

01:10:56.786 --> 01:11:00.289 region:rollup2

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:08.931 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATE INDEPENDENT

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:10.533 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS. AND THIS IS

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:12.702 region:rollup2
NECESSARY IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE

01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:13.603 region:rollup2
MISS CLASSIFICATION IS RAMPANT

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:14.604 region:rollup2

FOR TOO MANY WORKERS AND THIS

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:39.962 region:rollup2
ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO CONTINUE THE

01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:40.997 region:rollup2

IN MY TIME WITH HUMAN

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:28.818 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING CASES I'VE SEEN THAT

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:29.318 region:rollup2
THESE VICTIMS OFTEN HIDE IN THE

01:16:28.818 --> 01:16:30.286 region:rollup2

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:33.722 region:rollup2
I TOO HAVE SEEN TRAFFICKERS WHO

WITHHOLD DOCUMENTS ALLOW THEM TO

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:36.092 region:rollup2

IN SPEAKING WITH SURVIVORS AND

VICTIMS ESPECIALLY IMMIGRANTS I

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:43.899 region:rollup2
HAVE FOUND THAT THEY OFTEN DO

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:46.569 region:rollup2
NOT KNOW OUR SYSTEM.

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:48.003 region:rollup2
OUR LAWS HOW WE ENFORCE OUR LAWS

01:16:46.569 --> 01:16:48.637 region:rollup2
WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE OR EVEN

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:50.406 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE FOR THEM

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:53.209 region:rollup2
RIGHTS.

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:54.944 region:rollup2
PA AS NOT NEED OF CITIZENS.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:56.979 region:rollup2
THEY ARE OFTEN THEN MANIPULATED

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:58.214 region:rollup2
FIVE TRAFFICKER WHO EXPLAINS OUR

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:02.418 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE.

01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:04.320 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE TRAFFICKER SAYS.

01:17:02.418 --> 01:17:05.921 region:rollup2
ó THAT HE OR SHE NEEDS TO KEEP

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.490 region:rollup2

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:09.225 region:rollup2

01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:10.526 region:rollup2
CANNOT GO OUTSIDE INTO PUBLIC

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:11.427 region:rollup2

YOU DON'T GO ALONG WITH WHAT I

01:17:23.506 --> 01:17:27.209 region:rollup2

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:29.879 region:rollup2
TO FURTHER ISOLATE CONTROL THE

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:30.446 region:rollup2

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:30.980 region:rollup2

VISAS.

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:38.287 region:rollup2
AND THE BY THE TIME THEY ESCAPE

SIXTY NINE PERCENT ARE NO LONGER

01:17:38.287 --> 01:17:42.191 region:rollup2

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:40.522 region:rollup2
TAKING M. AS I AM RETALIATING

01:27:39.521 --> 01:27:42.057 region:rollup2
AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL FOR TAKING

01:27:40.522 --> 01:27:43.091 region:rollup2

01:27:42.057 --> 01:27:44.726 region:rollup2
WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER LEAVE.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:46.561 region:rollup2
ARE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:47.662 region:rollup2
DRAFTED NOW IS THERE ISN'T THE

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:50.065 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS AROUND THESE.

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:51.099 region:rollup2
AROUND FOR THE EMPLOYER AROUND

01:27:50.065 --> 01:27:52.300 region:rollup2
THESE TYPES OF LEAVE THAT THERE

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:53.301 region:rollup2
ARE FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:55.170 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:57.072 region:rollup2
ASSAULT DOES REQUIRE A POLICE

01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:58.106 region:rollup2
REPORT OR AND SOME SORT OF

01:27:57.072 --> 01:28:00.142 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION FROM A MEDICAL

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:01.977 region:rollup2
PROVIDER. AND THAT'S LACKING IN

01:28:00.142 --> 01:28:03.311 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL

01:28:01.977 --> 01:28:04.946 region:rollup2
SEWN INDIVIDUAL COULD ASSERT

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:06.148 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE TAKING SEXUAL

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:08.784 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT LEAVE FOR A SIMPLE

01:28:06.148 --> 01:28:10.652 region:rollup2
GLANCE AND FOR SOMEONE

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:12.888 region:rollup2
ACCIDENTALLY BRUSHING UP AGAINST

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:15.056 region:rollup2
THEM IN AN ELEVATOR. I'M BECAUSE

01:28:12.888 --> 01:28:16.825 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:18.193 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THE THE

01:28:16.825 --> 01:28:21.563 region:rollup2
SCOPE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS

01:28:18.193 --> 01:28:23.532 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY BROAD AND NOT ALL

01:28:21.563 --> 01:28:25.333 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT WHILE IT'S ALL

01:28:23.532 --> 01:28:26.935 region:rollup2
USUALLY INAPPROPRIATE NOT ALL

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:29.237 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ACTUALLY

01:28:26.935 --> 01:28:29.938 region:rollup2
ACTIONABLE UNDER THE LAW. AND SO

01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:32.774 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SOME SORT OF

01:28:29.938 --> 01:28:35.210 region:rollup2
NOTIFICATION OR VERIFICATION FOR

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:37.712 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER AND THIS IS A GOOD

01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:39.414 region:rollup2
THIS COULD BE ABUSED AND THAT'S

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:41.716 region:rollup2
WHERE OUR CONCERN LIES THAT WE

01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:42.617 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE SOME VERIFICATION.

01:28:41.716 --> 01:28:44.452 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY.

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:47.088 region:rollup2
THERE IS.

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:51.459 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE IS IN THE LABOR

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:54.930 region:rollup2
CODE AND FEE HA ACTUALLY.

CONTROL SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:58.099 region:rollup2
RETALIATION DISCRIMINATION IT'S

01:28:57.465 --> 01:29:08.076 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERNS ARE THERE THAT IT'S

01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:10.478 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DISCUSSED WITH THE

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:12.581 region:rollup2
AUTHOR. AND LET ME JUST NOTE IT.

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:15.317 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN SECTION ONE OF

01:29:12.581 --> 01:29:17.285 region:rollup2
THE BILL. LABOR CODE TO THIRTY.

01:29:15.317 --> 01:29:18.720 region:rollup2

NOTICE OF INTENTION TO TAKE OFF.

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:25.827 region:rollup2
IN DE TO THEN IT SAYS

CERTIFICATION SHALL BE

01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:28.630 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT IN ANY OF THE

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:31.900 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING FORMS.

01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:32.234 region:rollup2
A TWO A. B. AND SEE THE PROBLEM

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:33.768 region:rollup2
IS IS THAT.

01:29:32.234 --> 01:29:35.604 region:rollup2
THAT NONE OF THESE INCLUDE

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:37.005 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:29:35.604 --> 01:29:38.607 region:rollup2
ONLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL

ASSAULT OR STOCKING.

ON THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASPECT

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:46.181 region:rollup2
