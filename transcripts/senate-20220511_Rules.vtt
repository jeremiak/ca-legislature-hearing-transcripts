MANY FOLKS HAVE SORT OF RAISED

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:34.480
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THIS

LEGAL CHALLENGE AND- IT'S YET TO

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:09.982

FORTH WITH THEM AND WANTS TO DO

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.680

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:54.106
POSITION WITH STAFF AND COMMIT.

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:56.041
TO YOUR- IT CAN THIS MEASURE.

KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON GETTING-

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:05.751
ON BECOMING AREN'T GETTING A

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:07.686
BACHELOR'S DEGREE BEFORE

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.255
BECOMING AN OFFICER IN A WHAT

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:12.024
ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THESE

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.292
DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE NOW

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:16.462
HAPPENING THAT- OFFICER SHOULD

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:19.631
HAVE BE AS- AND IF WE GET IT.

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:21.400
YEAH I THINK EDUCATION IS REALLY

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.936
IMPORTANT COMPONENTS BUT I DON'T

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:26.638
NECESSARILY THINK IT NEEDS TO BE

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:27.806
A QUALIFIER TO BECOME A POLICE

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:30.108
OFFICER. I THINK THAT THEY NEED

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:32.077
TO SHOW A COUNTY NEED TO SHOW

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.979
THAT THEY HAVE SOME EDUCATION AS

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:35.881
IT LEAST STARTED. THEIR

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:39.084
EDUCATION- BECAUSE I DO THINK

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.819
THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT NOT

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:42.254
EVERYONE HAS THE SAME

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:44.289
OPPORTUNITIES. AND SO I THINK

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:46.391
THAT WE LIMITS SOME OF THE POOL

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.460
OF APPLICANTS THAT WE HAVE. IF

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:52.097
WE DON'T ALLOW FOR EDUCATION TO

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:55.033
HAPPEN CONTINUOUSLY ONCE THEY

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.902
BECOME A POLICE OFFICER. YOU

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:58.303
KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.505
INCENTIVES THAT WE OFFER AS AN

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:02.407
AGENCY IS THAT WE PAY FOR

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.308
FURTHER EDUCATION. WHO WILL PAY

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:04.943
FOR THEIR TUITION THEY GIVE

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.745
THOSE THAT MAY NOT HAVE HAD AN

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:09.081
OPPORTUNITY BEFORE- TO COMPLETE

00:19:09.147 --> 00:19:11.416
THAT. THE WE HAVE CANDIDATES

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.585
THAT COME IN THAT OR FROM

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:14.987
MINORITY FAMILIES WHO ARE

00:19:15.053 --> 00:19:16.722
ACTUALLY THE PRIMARY SUPPORTERS

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:18.690
OF THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEY

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.659
HAVEN'T HAD THE SAME-

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:22.060
OPPORTUNITIES TO COMPLETE THEIR

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:23.762
BACHELOR'S DEGREE WHEN THEY COME

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.364
IN. SO I THINK THAT YES

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.399
EDUCATIONS IT CAN IMPORTANT

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:28.734
COMPONENT BUT I DON'T THINK IT

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:35.274
SHOULD BE A QUALIFIER BY ITSELF. WERE WHETHER OR NOT WE HIGHER

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.309
NOT LOOKING. GREAT BUT MY UNDER

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:37.976
IS THAT YOU MANY OF YOUR

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:39.912
OFFICERS ALL HAVE THE IS TO BE A

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:41.747
DEGREE. MANY OF MY OFFICERS DO

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:43.282
IN FACT THAT BA DEGREES IT'S

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:44.816
SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOURAGE AND

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:47.853
I ACTUALLY HAVE SEVERAL OFFICERS

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.788
THAT HAVE THEIR MASTER'S DEGREES

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.757
. BUT IN TERMS OF IT BEING A

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:55.027
DISQUALIFIER. I AM NOT IN IN

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.628
FAVOR OF IT BEING A DISQUALIFIER

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:58.196
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT I

00:19:58.263 --> 00:19:59.965
CLEARLY BELIEVE IN EDUCATION I

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.000
HAVE AN EDUCATION. BUT I ALSO

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:04.670
KNOW THAT. YOU DON'T MY WIFE

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:05.304

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.939
OPPORTUNITIES THAT I DID AND SHE

00:20:07.005 --> 00:20:08.607
WENT BACK LATER IN LIFE AND

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:10.409
AFTER TAKING ONE CLASS AT A TIME

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.611
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. WHEN

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:14.079
BACKING A BENCH LEE GOT HER

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:15.280
BACHELOR'S AND HER MASTER'S

DEGREE AND THEN HER LICENSE TO

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:20.118
PRACTICE SO I THINK THAT

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:21.320
EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT PATH.

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:22.721
AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT IN

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:24.222

LARGE UNITS ON THERE AND HAD TO

00:22:17.302 --> 00:22:19.337
DO ON WITH TRAINING ALSO BECAUSE

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:21.239
TRAINS A VERY IMPORTANT KEY TO

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:22.741
ANY ORGANIZATION TO KEEP IT

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:24.876
RUNNING AND KEEP IT HEALTHY- BUT

00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:26.144

THE CITY- IT WAS LIKE BEING A

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.888

THEY'RE DOWN ABOUT NINETY FIVE

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:44.229
HUNDRED BECAUSE THEY HIRINGS A

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:47.199
LITTLE DIFFICULT BUT- WHEN YOU

00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:48.934
COME FROM A VERY LARGE AGENCY

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.068
WHEN IT COMES TO TRAINING THEY

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:52.971
CAN DEDICATE PEOPLE- TO WORK

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:54.172
CERTAIN JOBS TO HELP TRAIN

00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:55.874
OFFICERS SO YOU HAVE COMPLETE

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:58.877
TRAINING UNITS- AND THEY DO A

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:01.780
LOT OF THE WORK- IS TO KEEP UP

EITHER THE STATE OR ON A FEDERAL

00:23:08.019 --> 00:23:10.322

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.428
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. OR THE NINE

00:31:37.495 --> 00:31:39.764
NINE CRITERIA- THAT WE HAVE A

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.202
SERIOUSLY I THINK WE'RE ALL IN

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:45.336
AGREEMENT THAT NOBODY WANTS BAD

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:47.405
ACTORS ARE BAD APPLES AND

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:48.473
POLICE. IN POLICING AND PUBLIC

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:51.442
SAFETY IT MAKES EVERYBODY. LOOK

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:54.445
BAD OF ONE PERSON TARNISHES THE

00:31:54.512 --> 00:31:56.648
BADGE IT TARNISHES THE BADGE.

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:58.916
NATIONALLY SO WE DON'T WANT THAT

00:31:58.983 --> 00:32:00.518
BUT IN THE SAME RESPECT YOU DO

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.153
WANT TO PROTECT. THOSE PEOPLE

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.255
WHO. REALLY THEIR LIVES AND

00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:06.624
DEDICATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT-

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:07.592

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:10.228
LIVELIHOODS- BASED ON BAD

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:11.729
INFORMATION SO AGAIN I JUST WANT

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:14.732

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:15.300
POST WILL GIVE US COMPLETED-

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:17.602
CASES ARE THAT WE CAN MAKE. GOOD

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:18.936
THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

00:32:19.003 --> 00:32:21.239
DETERMINATIONS WHEN WE VOTE- BUT

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.774
THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.842
BEEN AT THE BACK OF MY MIND AS

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:25.943
WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.546

THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL ARE

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:33.084
BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER SORT OF A

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:35.453
CORPORATE PROCEEDINGS. OF THE

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.089
LAST QUESTION ON ON DEATH- IS

00:32:38.156 --> 00:32:40.792
THE CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIALITY

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:41.893
BECAUSE CERTAINLY WITH OUR WORK

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:43.928
FORCE. COMPLIANCE UNIT HERE WE

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.930

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:48.132
CONFIDENTIALITY ACCOUNT ALWAYS.

00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:49.901
ENSURE THAT THERE WON'T BE ON TO

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:52.003
A LITTLE BIT OF- YOU KNOW RUMORS

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.605
AND- LEAKS THAT TUB. IS THAT

00:32:54.672 --> 00:32:55.873
SOMETHING THAT'S PART OF THE

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.678
PROCESS. UP UNTIL THE FINAL

00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:01.813
DECISION. TO A SPECIFIC PERSON

00:33:01.879 --> 00:33:04.215

NOT LATE BUT- I I'M NOT QUITE

00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:18.229
SURE HOW CLOSE IS GONNA HANDLE

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.098

ACTUALLY GOES TO POST I BELIEVE

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:23.968
THAT- PUBLIC RECORDS ACT YOU YOU

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:26.237

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:27.672
KNOW FROM OTHER CHEESE SAYS AS

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:29.273
WE LOOK AT THIS WITH CAL CHIU

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.709
SAID MAYBE- COMMISSIONER GORDON

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:33.077

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:35.480
BECAUSE I KNOW SHE SITS ON. CAL

00:33:35.546 --> 00:33:37.281
CHEESE THERE IS SOME CONCERN

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:38.883
ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHAT ARE GOING

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.652
TO BE THE PRIVACY RIGHTS AND

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:42.286
WHAT WILL POST RELEASE OR NOT

RELEASE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:48.159
THIS- AGAIN I THINK. SURE

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:50.027
BARCELONA A LOT ABOUT IT I THINK

00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:51.829
IT WAS THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:52.964
WITH THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.099
OF CASE LAW AND A LOT OF

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:57.168
OPINIONS. ON THAT ARE GOING TO

00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:58.169
CHANGE THE PROCESS. IN THE

00:33:58.236 --> 00:33:59.704
COMING YEARS- JUST BASED ON SOME

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:01.806
OF THE UNANSWERED. QUESTIONS OR

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.875
THINGS THAT WE JUST. CAN'T

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:07.311
ANTICIPATE WHEN YOU ARE. PASSED

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:09.213
LEGISLATION LIKE IT'S SB TWO.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.449
JEFF GORDON DID YOU WANT TO ADD

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:14.352
ANYTHING TO THAT. BUT I WOULD

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:16.454
APPROVED- CHIEF ME AT THOSE

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:17.522
COMMENTS I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD

00:34:17.588 --> 00:34:19.123
THE DISCUSSION OF HOW IMPORTANT

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.526
AND HOW SERIOUS WE ALL TAKE THIS

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:24.762
THE CONFIDENTIALITY IS

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:26.931
CERTAINLY- VERY IMPORTANT AND IS

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:28.900
OF A CONCERN BECAUSE THE LAST

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:31.068
THING WE WANT IS FOR THIS TO

00:34:31.135 --> 00:34:32.937
BECOME A VOTE OF- PUBLIC

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:36.207
OPINION- OF VERSES. HE VOTED

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:39.343
BASED ON FACTS THAT AND WE TO

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.646
TALLY OF THE ENTIRE CASE. SO I

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:43.714
THINK IF THINGS BECOME PUBLIC

00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:45.883
INFORMATION BEFORE THAT OCCURS.

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.251
THAT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS ON

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:51.289
BOTH SIDES OF THE CASE. IT'S

00:34:51.355 --> 00:34:52.657
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:54.625
MAINTAIN THAT CONFIDENTIALITY

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:57.128
ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH. THE VOTE

00:34:57.195 --> 00:34:58.963
I'M ALL FOR TRANSPARENCY BUT I'M

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.999
ALSO FOR DUE PROCESS AND LIKE I

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:06.103
SAID IT NOT JUST BECOMING A- THE

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.171
BILL BASED ON LIMITED

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:08.639
INFORMATION SO THAT

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:10.007
CONFIDENTIALITY THAT NOT LEAKING

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:11.876
OF INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.478
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE

00:35:13.544 --> 00:35:16.013
ULTIMATELY YOU PRIOR TO POST

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.648
MAKING A POST MEASURES MAKING A

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:20.585
FINAL DECISION IT'S GOING TO GO

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:21.219
TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.653
TO DO A FULL EVIDENTIARY

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.254
HEARING. WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:27.158
TO WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT IN

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:29.126
TERMS OF A BORDER RIGHTS. AND I

00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.628
THINK THAT'S IT IMPORT STEP IN

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:31.929
THE PROCESS. BECAUSE IT ALSO

00:35:31.996 --> 00:35:33.431
THEN IF THERE'S- INFORMATION

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:35.833
THAT HAS BEEN ANSWERED OR YOU

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.902
KNOW IN THE CASE OF A USE OF

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:39.937
FORCE THAT THAT'S AN EXCESSIVE

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:41.138
FORCE REALLY BEING ABLE TO FIND

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:43.441
OUT. ADDITIONAL ANSWERS IN TERMS

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:45.009
OF WHAT WAS IN THE OFFICER'S

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:46.811
MIND IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.412
MAY BE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:49.113
THAT COMES OUT THROUGH THAT

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.948
PROCESS IT'S GONNA BE REALLY

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:54.352
IMPORTANT TO THE DECISION MAKING

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:56.521
PROCESS. ONE CONCERN I DO HAVE

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:57.788
IS. THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THE

00:35:57.855 --> 00:35:59.624
PROCESS AT THIS POINT PROPOSED

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:00.258
COMMISSIONERS WILL SEE THE CASE

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:02.760
TWICE. ONCE BECAUSE THE ADVISORY

WEEK PRIOR TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:11.702

00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:16.073

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.542

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:40.224
WELL. SO MY OTHER- CONCERN THAT

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:43.227
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ABOUT IN IN

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:45.863
GROUPS OF TWO I THANK. IT HAS TO

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.865
DO WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF-

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.534
S. B. TWO THIRTY ON THE USE OF

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:54.672
FORCE. AND M. ALL START WITH THE

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:56.374
TO OUR POLICE CHIEFS THE TWO

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.679
NEWEST MEMBERS BECAUSE THE FARM. YOU'RE SEEING THIS FROM BOTH

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:06.317
SIDES GET YOUR- YOU'RE MEMBERS

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:09.654
OF POST THAT HAS TO IMPLEMENT.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.456
OF USE OF FORCE TRAINING AND

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:15.793
UNIFOR'S UNIFORM N OF MOM USE

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.461
OF FORCE GUIDELINES BUT NOW

00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:19.030
THEY'VE BEEN IN PLACE FOR A YEAR

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.031
WHEN YOU'RE BOTH LOCAL LAW

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.832
ENFORCEMENT THAT HAS TO

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:24.168
IMPLEMENT THEM AND- I GUESS MY

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:27.071
QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU DETERMINE

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.506
WHETHER THE TRAINING IS

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:29.674
EFFECTIVE. AND WHETHER YOU

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.308
BELIEVE THE GUIDELINES ARE BEING

00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:32.743
FOLLOWED BY LOCAL LAW

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.713
ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK UP I'D

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.882
START WITH CHIEF GORDON AND

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:42.186
CHIEF NAFTA. I THINK THE WE ARE

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:45.356
ALL- WORKING THROUGH THIS WE

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:46.490
HAVE STARTED IMPLEMENTING AND

00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:47.725
THIS OUR DEPARTMENT WE STARTED

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:49.260
IMPLEMENTING IMMEDIATELY IN

00:38:49.326 --> 00:38:51.762
TERMS OF UPDATING OUR USE OF

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:55.433
FORCE POLICIES OR USE OF FORCE

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:58.335
TRAINING- WE'VE ACTUALLY. GONE

00:38:58.402 --> 00:39:01.372
BACK TO DOING OUR IN HOUSE

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:02.907
TRAINING BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:06.043
SOME QUALITY CONTROL SO WE HAVE

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.412
OUR OWN USE OF FORCE INSTRUCTORS

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:10.614
AND HAVE BEEN GETTING OUR OWN

00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:12.850
CERTIFIED WE'VE BEEN-

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.018
IMPLEMENTING THE TRAINING TO

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.920
DIFFERENT PLACES WERE TRACKING

00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:17.822
OR DE ESCALATION. THE WORLD

00:39:17.888 --> 00:39:19.123
LOOKING ORDER USES OF FORCE

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.059
DIFFERENTLY IN TERMS OF. WHAT

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.895
KIND OF FORCE ARE WORSE ARE WE

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:27.665
ARE TYPICALLY SEEN ARE THE

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:29.600
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:30.768
OF TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:32.703
WE'RE CORRECTING ANY OF THESE

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.705
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE NEW-

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:36.540
YOU SUPPORT STANDARDS AND- AND I

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:37.675
THINK IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:40.511
CULTURAL CHANGE. AND IT'S L.

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:44.081
MAKING THAT SHIFT IN HELPING

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:44.682
OFFICERS UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:46.083
NOT THAT THEY CANNOT USE FORCE

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.818
BUT IT'S THE EXPECTATIONS OF

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:48.953
UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THEY

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:51.622
CANNED AND HOW THEY DO THAT AND-

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:53.224
THE- THE WAY THAT THE

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.060
ESCALATION. IS INVOLVED IN THAT.

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:58.295
SO I THINK IT'S AN ON GOING

00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:00.731
PROCESS I THINK THAT. PART OF IT

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:02.199
IS HOW WE COMMUNICATED TO OUR

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:04.468
OFFICERS BECAUSE JUST. LOOKING

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:07.404
AT IT B. O. S. CAN YOU GIVE THEM

00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:09.673
ALL A BIT OF PAUSE ON. YOUR

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.710
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN- IF I USE

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:15.713
FORCE. AND THEY HAVE TO KNOW

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.848
THAT THEY CAN WHEN IT'S- WHEN

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.150
THE SITUATION CALLS FOR IT

00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:20.751
BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE ALSO

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.620
DON'T WANT TO SEE IS OFFICERS

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:23.187
GETTING HURT. BECAUSE THEY

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:25.122
HAVEN'T TAKEN ACTION SO I THINK

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:27.491
THAT WE ARE DOING A BETTER JOB

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:29.260
OF HELPING OUR OFFICERS

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:31.395
UNDERSTAND THE ESCALATION WHAT

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:33.430
THAT LOOKS LIKE. FROM WHAT

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.232
OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:38.469
IT'S A LOT OF IT IS HELPING THEM

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:39.103
SLOW DOWN AND UNDERSTAND THAT

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.538
THEY HAVE TIME WHEN THEY DO AND

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:42.840
THEY DON'T ALWAYS. BUT IT'S PART

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:44.241
OF THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS

00:40:44.308 --> 00:40:45.843
IT'S PART OF DOING CRITICAL

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.078
INCIDENT DEBRIEFS YOU KNOW WE'VE

00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:50.214
GONE TO BODY CANCERS IN CAR CAM

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.316
SO THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:54.285
REALLY SIT BACK AND LOOK AT SOME

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:55.986
INCIDENTS. AND DO IT IN A WAY

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:57.321
WERE FEEDBACK IS ACCEPTED AND

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.924
IT'S NOT UNITS. SO THAT WE CAN

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.025
BECOME BETTER BECAUSE I THINK

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:02.860
THAT'S ALSO. A BIG COMPONENT OF

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:05.229
IT IS LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BE

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:07.832
BETTER AND NOT ALWAYS DENIED IT

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:10.134
IN TERMS OF OUR PUNITIVE- THERE

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:11.268
ARE SOMETIMES IT THAT DISCIPLINE

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:13.003
IS WARRANTED. BUT ALSO LOOKING

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.172
AT IT IN TERMS OF LEARNING AND

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:17.074
TEACHING WE CAN'T MISS THAT

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:17.875
POINT BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.743
REASONS THAT NOW. WE'VE GONE

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.745
BACK TO HAVING OUR OWN IN HOUSE

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:23.214
YES OF COURSE INSTRUCTORS

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.217
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT- YOU

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:28.219
KNOW. MOVING ACROSS THE MAT TEN

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:29.587
TIMES ARE DOING THINGS IT'S

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:31.488
ABOUT HOW WE APPLY FORCE AND

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:32.089
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:34.625
DECISION MAKING PROCESS IS MORE

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:38.696
IMPORTANT. THAN HOW WE'RE

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:39.897
TRAINING OUR OFFICERS. THANK YOU

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.565
VERY MUCH ARE PER. THE VETR. A

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:43.133
METAL AND- BY THE WAY IT'S GOOD

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.638
TO SEE YOU. I THINK YOU'RE ON

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:51.442

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:53.077
. AT THE W. I GOTTA KEEP

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:55.179
REMEMBERING THE HIT THAT SECOND

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:59.016
BUTTON SO ON UP ON SB TWO

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:02.586
THIRTY- I LOOK AT IT A LITTLE

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:03.554
BIT DIFFERENTLY- I DO BELIEVE

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.189
THAT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WE

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:07.391
WERE DOING A LOT OF THESE THINGS

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:07.892
BEFORE THE LAW WAS EVEN

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:10.594
IMPLEMENTED AS FAR AS USE OF

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:12.162
FORCE POLICIES- WE ARE WE ARE

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:14.431
ALREADY INCORPORATING ON BIASES

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:17.701
IMPLICIT BIASES EXPLICIT BIASES-

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:19.837
OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE- SPIN

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:21.272
AROUND FOR ABOUT. THREE YEARS

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:23.540
NOW AND A LOT CHANGED ON THAT

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:25.242
AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:26.610
THAT- WITH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:28.646
USE FORCE IN THIS WAS HAPPENING.

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.581
IN OUR AGENCIES INCLUDING- MY

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:32.883
PRIOR AGENCY AND NOW WITH BRING

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.686
UP DEPARTMENTS. THE REQUIREMENT

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:39.657
TO START REPORTING I THINK THAT-

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:41.959
THE EDUCATION PIECE WAS TO

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:43.427
EXPLAIN TO THE OFFICERS THIS IS

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:45.129
A REQUIREMENT AND WE'RE

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:48.165
REPORTING STUFF- THAT MEETS

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.367
THOSE STANDARDS THAT THE STATUS

00:42:50.434 --> 00:42:52.636
AS THE SHALL BE REPORTED. I

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:54.038
GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN AND MAYBE

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:55.272
I'M ONE OF THESE COMMISSIONERS

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:57.374
THAT HAVE A LOT OF CONCERN AND-

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.109
MAYBE I THINK ABOUT THESE

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:02.646
ISSUES. WAY TOO MUCH- IS THAT

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:06.517
ALL AGENCIES ARE REPORTING UNDER

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.419
THE STANDARDS AND NOT

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:11.255
INTERPRETING USES OF FORCE IN A

00:43:11.322 --> 00:43:13.857
WAY THAT IT MAY NOT BE REPORTED

00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:15.926
. BECAUSE CAN'T TRACK THE

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:21.665
METRICS PIECE THAT- IT YOU CAN.

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:22.766
AS FAR FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:24.168
LEADERS HOW DO YOU MAKE THE

00:43:24.234 --> 00:43:25.970
PROCESS BETTER OR DO WE NEED TO

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:26.837
TRY PEOPLE. OR OR WHAT'S

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:27.938
STICKING WHAT'S NOT STICKING

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:29.073
WITH THE COMMUNITY CONCERNED

00:43:29.139 --> 00:43:30.708
ABOUT ARE OR HOW THEY FEEL THE

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:32.109
WHOLE TRUST PEACE THE WHOLE

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:33.677
PROCEDURAL JUSTICE PIECE OF IT.

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:35.312
I GUESS I LOOK AT IT FROM THAT

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:37.181
PERSPECTIVE- BECAUSE I'M ALSO A

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:39.950
POLICE PERFORMANCE AUDITOR. ON

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:42.119
AND SO I KNOW LIKE N A REGIONAL

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:45.723
LEVEL- WITH MY CURRENT AGENCY-

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.624
WE ASKED ACTUALLY ASKED HER

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:50.627
INSURANCE CARRIER- TO COME IN

00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:52.730
AND HIGHER INDEPENDENT AUDITOR.

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.865
ACTUALLY TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:57.067
THESE- GUIDELINES ACTUALLY UNDER

00:43:57.134 --> 00:44:00.204
S. B. TWO THIRTY AND THEN ALSO

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.439
ON OTHER HIGH RISK ISSUES. OF

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.775
WHERE WE CAN DO BETTER. AND

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.410
QUITE HONESTLY I THINK WE ALL

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:08.512
FOUND THINGS OUT- FOR THE

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:10.547
SMALLER AGENCIES BECAUSE AGAIN.

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:11.949
WE HAVE TO WEAR MANY DIFFERENT

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:13.817
HATS AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:16.286
HALF THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. A

00:44:16.353 --> 00:44:17.221
SO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT

00:44:17.287 --> 00:44:18.922
OVERLOOK MY USE OF FORCE BEFORE

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.557
IT EVEN GETS INTO MY INBOX ARE

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:22.993
ALSO MY PATROL SERGEANTS OR THEY

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.996
MAY BE AND IN CHARGE OR

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:26.897
SOMETHING ELSE- SO WE DON'T WANT

00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:28.932
TO SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS SO. I

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:30.968
GUESS- AS A COMMISSIONER I'D BE

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:33.003
ASKING THESE QUESTIONS OF WHAT

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.773
OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY. IS HOW DO

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.908
YOU ENSURE THAT YOU ARE

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:40.010
IMPLEMENTING WHAT SB TWO THIRTY

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:41.979
IS GHASTLY DEAL HOST DOES A VERY

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:44.381
GOOD JOB. ON WITH ITS TRAINING

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:46.183
AND PUSHING THE TRAINING OUT.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.718
BUT ONCE THE TRAINING IS PUSHED

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:48.919
OUT OR WE KNOW WHAT THE

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:50.888
REPORTING PROCEDURES ARE. ARE

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:52.990
HOW ARE WE ENSURING THAT

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:55.125
AGENCIES ARE REPORTING CORRECTLY

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:55.959
I GUESS THAT THAT'S MYONLY

00:44:56.026 --> 00:45:01.698
CONCERN AS FAR AS THE NEW LAW.

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:02.866
AND MAYBE I'M OVERTHINKING THAT

00:45:02.933 --> 00:45:04.034
SENATOR. FROM I DON'T YOU ARE-

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:05.736
OF. OVERTIME ANSWER THAT

00:45:05.803 --> 00:45:07.071
QUESTION IS GOING TO BE REALLY

00:45:07.137 --> 00:45:10.007
IMPORTANT. TO THE SUCCESS OF IT

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:12.309

IMPLEMENTED THE STATE HAS DONE A

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.382
REALLY GOOD JOB OF MAKING SURE

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:56.520

TRAINED PROPERLY AND I'VE GONE

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.165
AROUND THE STATE TO TRAINING.

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:09.566

BETTER THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:43.367
THAT MOST AGENCIES ARE SHORT

00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:44.835
STAFFED AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:47.404
TIME AND POWER TO ROTATE PEOPLE

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.806

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:59.002
ABOUT. DECISION MAKING ACTUALLY

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:01.571

OVERLOOKED- AND MAYBE THE GOAL

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:25.814
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:27.683
ARE SORT OF SHUFFLED THROUGH THE

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.019

THIS THAT IS NOT THE SITUATION

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:35.891
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD THERE

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.726
IS NO POINT OR PROCESS OTHER

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.528

IN THE PROCESS. AFTER INITIAL-

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.022
THE INITIAL COMPLAINT N. AND THE

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:09.191
INVESTIGATOR IS THERE ANY POINT

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:10.125
IN THE PROCESS WHERE THE

DISSIPATION IS DEFINED IN THE

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.405
LAW AND THAT- FOR EXAMPLE- HE

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:24.873
INSTEAD OF THE PRESCRIPTION TO

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.875

GENERAL'S OFFICE OR- OR OTHERS.

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:36.551
SO IT'S THE IT'S THE ATTORNEY

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.253
GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT DETERMINES

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.689
WHETHER THE COMPLAINT IT HAS A

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:43.625
ROLE IN ANY HEARING. I BELIEVE

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:48.663
SO YES OKAY IN- I NOTICED AND-

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.599

LOOKS AT CASES DO DO THE PANELS

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:03.945

THE GUIDELINES OUR GUIDELINES

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.194

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:20.629
GUIDELINES THEMSELVES STATE THAT

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:21.763
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.232

EVIDENTIARY PROBLEMS- THAT THE

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:32.040
GUIDELINES STATE THAT THE-

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:35.043
PHYSICIAN IS WILLING TO ACCEPT

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.945
REHABILITATION. IN THIS PART OF

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:39.047
THE PROCESS THAT WE MAY BE A

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:40.916
REASON TO BUY TICKETS AT ONCE-

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:42.951
THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME PLANS

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:44.653

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.135
NOT BE ABLE TO PROVE THE

ALLEGATION AND HEARING AND THE

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:03.138
SETTLEMENT ALLOWS US TO IMPOSE

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:07.075
SOME DISCIPLINE. THAT WE MIGHT

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:08.310

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.872
WE DO NOT CERTIFY TRANSMISSIONS

01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:06.140
ARE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THERE

01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:07.941
IS ALSO THE- FEDERAL REGULATORY

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:09.443
OVERSIGHT OF THOSE AND THE

01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:11.412
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN US AND THE

01:39:11.478 --> 01:39:13.614
COMMISSION THE COMMISSION STILL.

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.782
OWNS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:15.949
AUTHORITY TO SET THE

01:39:16.016 --> 01:39:17.818
CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS- THAT

01:39:17.885 --> 01:39:19.920
THESE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:22.323
BUILT ON- BUT I TO YOUR POINT

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:24.024
THOUGH IN TERMS OF WHEN WE GO

01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:25.959
OUT THERE AND DO INVESTIGATIONS

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:27.461
WHICH ARE FOCUSED ON ARE THEY

01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:27.995
IMPLEMENTING THE WILDFIRE

01:39:28.062 --> 01:39:30.097
MITIGATION PLAN ACTIVITIES THAT

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:31.165
THEY ARTICULATED AND WERE

01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:33.100
APPROVED IN ANY PLAN THAT WE

01:39:33.167 --> 01:39:36.637
APPROVED- MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:38.339
THAT THAT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY.

01:39:38.405 --> 01:39:39.573
TAKE AWAY OR REDUCE THEIR

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.875
LIABILITY- TO OPERATE THE GRID

01:39:41.942 --> 01:39:44.745
SAFELY- ALTERNATELY- ANY

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:46.246
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAUSES AN

01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:48.315
IGNITION WOULD STILL BEAT UP

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:49.850
PROCESS THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:51.418
WORK- WHILE THE PUBLIC SAFETY OR

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:52.953
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION'S

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.455
WILDFIRE INVESTIGATION PROCESS

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:57.124
IN TERMS OF THE- REASONABLENESS

01:39:57.191 --> 01:40:01.795
OR NEGLIGENCE THAT THEY HAD. FOR

01:40:01.862 --> 01:40:03.130

I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:18.312
GOTTEN A LOT OF THE THINGS I

01:40:18.379 --> 01:40:20.347
WANT WANTED TO GET AT BUT I

01:40:20.414 --> 01:40:22.583
STILL HAVE SORT OF THE QUESTION

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:23.751

01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:27.354
CONVERSATION WHICH IS. YOU HAVE

THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESSES

01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:57.718
AND I THINK THAT'S THE GOOD AND

01:40:57.785 --> 01:40:59.653
AT SOME POINT TO NAY FORGET

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.155

ACTUALLY GETTING AT THE PROBLEM

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.840
THAT THIS OF THESE PLANS IN THIS

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:22.976
AGENCIES FORM TO ADDRESS. ALL

DAY THIS IS ABOUT DO WE CHANGE

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:30.617
THE OUTCOMES ARE WE IMPROVING

01:41:30.684 --> 01:41:31.752
SAFETY OUTCOMES FOR THE

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:33.954
RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA- IT

01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:36.457
COMES DOWN TO. ARE WE NOT HAVING

01:41:36.523 --> 01:41:39.293
MISSIONS BASED ON UTILITY COST

01:41:39.359 --> 01:41:41.995
INFRASTRUCTURE- ISSUES SO I TELL

01:41:42.062 --> 01:41:44.164
HIM ALL THE TIME OUR JOB BOILS

01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:46.967
DOWN TO. SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:48.335
THE NUMBER OF SPARKS THAT TURN

01:41:48.402 --> 01:41:49.736
INTO IGNITIONS FROM ENERGY

01:41:49.803 --> 01:41:50.971
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:53.407
ELIMINATING THE SPARKS THE TURN

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:54.408
INDIGNATION THAT POTENTIALLY

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:57.010
TURN INTO CATASTROPHIC FIRES- SO

01:41:57.077 --> 01:41:58.946
TO ME THAT'S THE END GOAL AND WE

01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:01.381
WHAT WE MONITOR THAT VERY

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:03.784
CLOSELY. SO WE MONITOR EVERY DAY

01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:05.686
THE IGNITION RATES FROM

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.821
INFRASTRUCTURE- INTERNET UTILITY

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.957
INFRASTRUCTURE- ONE OF THE

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:12.593
THINGS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE

01:42:12.659 --> 01:42:14.194
STANDING UP THE DEPARTMENT WOMAN

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:15.162
MOVED OVER FROM THE COMMISSION

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:16.897
IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT. IS WE

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:18.131
IMPLEMENTED EMERGENCY

01:42:18.198 --> 01:42:20.300
REGULATIONS TO OBVIOUSLY RUN OUR

01:42:20.367 --> 01:42:21.535
DEPARTMENT AND WE REQUIRE THE

01:42:21.602 --> 01:42:24.438
UTILITIES TO SUBMIT TO US-

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.406
IGNITION REPORTS. EVERY TIME

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:28.041
THEY HAVE A TECHNICIAN- THEY

01:42:28.108 --> 01:42:30.711
HAVE TO TELL THEM TELL US ABOUT

01:42:30.777 --> 01:42:31.745
IT AND WE TRACK THAT AND THE

01:42:31.812 --> 01:42:33.714
GOAL HERE IS FOR US TO SEE A

01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:36.149
TREND LINE DOWN IN THE NUMBER OF

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:37.117
IGNITIONS. AND ELIMINATION OF

01:42:37.184 --> 01:42:39.920
IGNITIONS THAT CASH FIRES SO

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:41.788
THAT IS OUR IN GAME THAT WE

01:42:41.855 --> 01:42:43.056
MONITOR REALLY CLOSELY

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:45.225
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE DO. HAVE

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:49.229
TO DRIVE THAT NUMBER GO DOWN.

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:52.065
THEN ME THE CHAIR OF. ASK YOU

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:53.700
ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

01:42:53.767 --> 01:42:55.669
LEGISLATURE NOT SO YOU GO

01:42:55.736 --> 01:42:57.471
THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND YOU

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:58.939
REALIZE ALL THE THINGS YOU WERE

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.941
GIVEN IN THE LEGISLATION OR THE

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.276
THINGS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED IN

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:04.378
THE PLANTS. DON'T GIVE YOU SOME

01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:06.880
TOOLS THAT REALLY GET IT THIS

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:09.082
ARE YOU A POWER TO COME TO US

01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:11.218
AND SAY WE REALLY NEED TINKERING

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:13.120
WITH THE LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:15.756
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

01:43:15.822 --> 01:43:17.558
REAL TOOL THAT ALLOWS US TO

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:18.759
COMPLETELY GET IT THIS. AND

01:43:18.825 --> 01:43:19.359
MAYBE THAT'S A DUMB QUESTION I

01:43:19.426 --> 01:43:21.295
WS I HAD A MINOR ROLE IN THAT

01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:23.063
AGENCY AND I DON'T THINK WE WERE

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:24.698
FOR POWER TO COME TO THE

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.934
LEGISLATURE ABOUT CHECKING WITH

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.302
FIVE PEOPLE. BUT BUT NEVER. BUT

01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:30.370
NEVER THE LESS I MEAN WOULD THAT

01:43:30.437 --> 01:43:32.806
BE A GOAL THAT YOU TRY TO WORK

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:34.274
IT THROUGH THE CHAIN TO CALM AND

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:36.543
MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WE HAVE A

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:37.444
CHANCE TO FIX SOMETHING THAT

01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:39.780
THAT GIVES YOU A TOOL THAT YOU

01:43:39.846 --> 01:43:42.182
WISH YOU HAD. I KNOW THAT I HAVE

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:44.284
THE FULL SUPPORT OF ON BOTH THE

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:46.219
AGENCY AND THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:46.920
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BE

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:48.789
SUCCESSFUL IN DOING OUR JOB AND

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:51.625
IF THAT MEANS HAVING

01:43:51.692 --> 01:43:52.192
DISCUSSIONS- TO TALK ABOUT.

01:43:52.259 --> 01:43:54.294
FUTURE CHANGES. THROUGH THE

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:56.163
PROPER PROPER CHANNELS-

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:58.665
ABSOLUTELY WE WOULD WE WOULD DO

01:43:58.732 --> 01:43:59.800
THAT- EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME

01:43:59.866 --> 01:44:02.469
PAGE THAT WHAT WE MUST TO DO. IS

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:04.972
TO CHANGE HOW THE UTILITIES ARE

01:44:05.038 --> 01:44:06.406
BUILDING OPERATING AND

01:44:06.473 --> 01:44:07.708
MAINTAINING THEIR GRADE TO AVOID

01:44:07.774 --> 01:44:10.744
FUTURE FIRES- SO I THINK WE'RE

01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:12.079
ON THE SAME PAGE THAT I KNOW

01:44:12.145 --> 01:44:13.981
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE THERE-

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:16.316
AND YOU. I CAN CERTAINLY- TELL

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:17.718
YOU THAT THAT'S MY JOB IS I

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:19.720
REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:21.188
THAT'S WHAT WE DO. I WILL

01:44:21.254 --> 01:44:22.022
CONSIDER MYSELF SUCCESSFUL IN

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:24.491
THIS ROLE IN LESS WERE MOVING IN

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:25.892
THAT DIRECTION- JUST ENCOURAGE

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:27.794
YOU TO DO THAT BUT IT DOESN'T

01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:29.096
SOUND LIKE YOU NEED THE

01:44:29.162 --> 01:44:31.898
ENCOURAGEMENT. IS THE ARM. AND

01:44:31.965 --> 01:44:33.100
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:34.868
FLEXIBILITY AS THE SITUATION

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:36.903
CHANGES I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE P.

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:38.472
GENIES ANNOUNCED THEY WANT TO

01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:40.173
SPEND TENS OF BILLIONS OF

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.708
DOLLARS TO UNDERGROUND. WHAT'S

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:43.477
JUST SAY THEY WERE REALLY

01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:45.679
SUCCESSFUL AND ONE OF THAT. ARE

01:44:45.746 --> 01:44:47.080
DOES THAT MEAN YOU WOULD HAVE TO

01:44:47.147 --> 01:44:48.949
THAN REALLY A MENTOR TO ADDED

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:50.984
SAFETY PLANS BECAUSE- THE WHOLE

01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:52.986
PROCESS IS BASED ON WHAT THE

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:55.622
CURRENT SITUATION IS OF POWER

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:58.325
LINES AND WHAT'S ABOVE GROUND TO

01:44:58.392 --> 01:45:01.094
MEET. HOW WILL. WHAT YOU DO MOVE

01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:02.996
WITH THE CHANGES THAT HAPPENED

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:05.232
IN THE INDUSTRY OR ON THE GROUND

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:06.133
. YEAH I THINK YOU FOR THAT

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:07.100
QUESTION THAT'S ACTUALLY A

01:45:07.167 --> 01:45:08.335
REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION I

01:45:08.402 --> 01:45:10.604
THINK IT'S THE BEAUTY IN THE WAY

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:11.972
THAT THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:13.840
WAS SET UP THROUGH. THE CREATED

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:16.243
IT- AND I SAID I WILL CERTAINLY

01:45:16.309 --> 01:45:18.912
WASN'T A PART OF THAT BUT I HAVE

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:20.480
TO SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE-

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:21.948
FLEXIBILITY IN THE FOR SIDE THAT

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:23.316
THEY HAD IN CREATING THAT

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:25.452
FRAMEWORK SO BECAUSE IT IS AN

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:27.854
ANNUAL ITERATIVE PROCESS. EVERY

01:45:27.921 --> 01:45:29.923
YEAR WE ARE INFORMING AND

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.092
ADJUSTING AND CHANGING BASED ON

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.293
BOTH WHAT THAT HAVE LITERALLY

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.195
THE LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED AS

01:45:35.262 --> 01:45:37.297
WELL AS THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:39.700
NEEDS HAVE CHANGED- ARE CHANGING

01:45:39.766 --> 01:45:41.468
SO WE ACTUALLY A PRETTY DYNAMIC

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:45.539
PROCESS- TO BE ABLE TO. FEED IN

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:47.441
TO OUR GUIDELINES THAT WE

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:50.277
DEVELOP- FOR THE UTILITIES. POST

01:45:50.343 --> 01:45:51.745
TO SUBMIT PLANS AND WHAT IS ALL

01:45:51.812 --> 01:45:53.447
THE CONTENT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.515
PROVIDE- AS WELL AS OUR

01:45:55.582 --> 01:45:57.718
EVALUATION PROCESS. SO THEIR

01:45:57.784 --> 01:45:59.152
THREE YEAR PLANS BUT THEY

01:45:59.219 --> 01:46:00.787
PROVIDE US AN UPDATE EVERY YEAR

01:46:00.854 --> 01:46:03.190
SO THAT PROCESS IS BUILT INTO

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:04.224
THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:06.993
ESTABLISHED HERE FOR CONTINUAL

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:09.029
IMPROVEMENT AND ADJUSTMENTS. K.
