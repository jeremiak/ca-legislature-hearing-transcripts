ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING C. NINE YES CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I REALIZE THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BUT I'D LIKE TO RECALL- SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN OUR DISTRICT JUST RECENTLY WERE OFFICER CAMPUS WAS SHOT AND KILLED THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY WERE DEALING WITH HE WAS KILLED HIS WIFE HIS TWO SONS AND THE ONLY REASON IS TWO DAUGHTERS ARE ALIVE IS BECAUSE HE SKIPPED OUT OF A BEDROOM WINDOW AND RAN AWAY FROM THE HOUSE. I WAS MENTALLY ILL AND TO SEND OTHER THAN QUALIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT HAVE THE PROPER AND SAFE- A TIRE TO BE ABLE TO A- PROTECT THEMSELVES- OTHER THAN LIKE I SAID THE BENNETT THE ISSUE WITH OFFICER CAMPUS HE WAS. SHOT WITHOUT. THAT NOT IN THE CHEST AREA LET'S JUST SAY THAT- TO SEND SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT QUALIFIED TO DEAL WITH THAT SITUATION WILL BE DETRIMENTAL AND I THINK THAT WITHOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT SECURITY IN. THE PAST THE FACILITY FIRST AND SECURING THE SCENE FIRST SO THAT MAYBE THEN AFTERWARDS WE COULD SEND IN INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD TALK AND YOU KNOW CANCERS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW COMMUNICATE WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MENTALLY ILL I THINK THAT WOULD BE ONE THING BUT TO HAVE THEM BE THE FIRST RESPONDERS ARE TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES SO THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN DO THEIR JOB TO SECURE THE SCENE IS NOT A GOOD DEAL FOR ANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BACKGROUND. QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR PLEASE THE OTHER EXCEPT QUESTION YES. VERY MUCH SENATOR MCCAIN I ASK I MEAN AS A AS A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER WHO WOULD BE SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE RESPONDING TO THIS IF SUCH A PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED CAN YOU LET US KNOW PLEASE IF THE SITUATION WERE TO OCCUR A PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED THAT PROGRAM WOULD BE IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE ALL THOSE ASSESSMENTS AND PROTOCOLS ESTABLISHED. PRIOR RIGHT TO SOMEBODY GOING OUT THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF TRIAGE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THAT THAT THE APPROPRIATE IN PERSON WOULD BE SENT OUT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL A CALL IS THAT CORRECT. YES SENATOR EDWIN THAT IS CORRECT THE REALITY IS THAT NINE ONE ONE DISPATCH ARE NON VIOLENT NON CRIMINAL IN NATURE OFTEN TIMES THEIR CALLS REGARDING. PARKING NUISANCES NOISE NUISANCES ON ISSUES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH HOMELESSNESS- THEY ARE NOT CRIMINAL THEY'RE NOT VIOLENT IN NATURE THIS BILL EIGHT ESTABLISHES A PILOT PROGRAM WILL BE QUALIFIED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WOULD BE VETTED BEFORE THEY ARE APPROVED. TO OPERATE INTO COMMUNITIES THAT SEE THEY WOULD BE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT MOST OF THE TIME LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE TO RESPOND TO MANY OF THE CALLS THAT THEY GET IN- THE GOAL IS NOT TO HAVE ROGUE INDIVIDUALS RESPOND BUT IT IS TO. CONNECT TO APPROPRIATE RESPONDED. TO THE CALLS AND COMPLAINTS AND EMERGENCIES THAT ARE COMING IN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE SENATOR. I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY THEN THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND I VOTE ON THIS AND I THINK ANY TIME A CALL COMES IN BY THE VERY UNFORTUNATE. OCCURRENCE THAT HAPPENED WITH OFFICER COMPOST IN A AND THE A SYMBOL IN THE SENATOR'S DISTRICT. ANY TIME A NINE ONE ONE CALLS IN WITH SOMEBODY WITH A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE WITH POSSESSION OF A FIREARM THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WOULD BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN ANY. PROGRAM STEPS LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF TRIAGE BUILT INTO IT AND I WOULD. ENCOURAGE AND I VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE BAIT ON THE SIDE OF. NINETY NINE CENTER KARL MARGARITA CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK ALREADY.

WHO TRAGICALLY DIED LAST WEEK IN A SUICIDE BOMBER ATTACK OUTSIDE OF KABUL AIRPORT IN AFGHANISTAN. THIRTEEN TOTAL MILITARY PERSONNEL WERE KILLED ALL SERVING OUR COUNTRY AND FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST HUMANITARIAN- LIVES IN MODERN HISTORY. SENATOR MELINDA'S WILL BE EVENTS IN THE FIRST OF THE FOUR JOURNEY AND MEMORIES TODAY. MORNING HONORING CORPORAL HUNTER LOPEZ A LOT CONTINUE LOOKING INTO. LOOKING TO I'M SORRY AND IT WILL BE HERE FROM- OTHER SENATORS TOMORROW SENATOR MELINDA AS WE KNOW THAT THE LOPEZ FAMILY IS WATCHING THE SESSION TODAY. PLEASE SEND OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US HERE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE CENTER MELINDA'S THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I RISE TODAY TO ADJOURN IN THE MEMORY OF UNITED STATES CORPORAL HUNTER LOPEZ WHO WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED IN A TERRORIST ATTACK IN KABUL AFGHANISTAN. HUNTER WAS ONLY TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD HE WAS THE SON OF RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S CAPTAIN HERMAN LOPEZ AND DEPUTY SHERIFF ALICIA LOPEZ. CORPORAL LOPEZ GRADUATED FROM LOOKING AT THE HIGH SCHOOL IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND IT WAS AS A CHILD WHILE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT HUNDRED DEVELOPED HIS DESIRE TO PROTECT OTHERS. SO AS SOON AS HE WAS OLD ENOUGH HE BECAME A RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S EXPLORER SCOUT IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HE CONTINUED IN THAT POST UNTIL HE GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AFTER GRADUATION HUNTER ENLISTED IN THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS AND WAS ASSIGNED TO THE SECOND MARINE BATTALION FIRST MARINES STATIONED AT CAMP PENDLETON. THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PROFESSIONALS THE SECOND MARINE BATTALION FIRST MARINES HAVE A STORIED HISTORY. FOR THOSE WHO ARE OT FAMILIAR THIS UNIT WAS PART OF THE ASSAULT ON GUADALCANAL WHERE THEY DEFENDED AN AIRFIELD IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO. AND IN OKINAWA IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE DURING WORLD WAR TWO. IN. NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THIS UNIT RECEIVED A PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION WITH ONE SILVER AND FOUR BRONZE STARS FOR ITS ROLE DURING THE VIETNAM WAR. SO IT IS FITTING THAT CORPORAL LOPEZ. WHO KNEW FROM SUCH A TENDER YOUNG AGE THAT HE WAS PUT HERE ON THIS EARTH TO PROTECT OTHERS WOULD BECOME PART OF SUCH AN ELITE UNIT. CORBULO PREZ WAS PLANNING TO FOLLOW HIS PARENTS FOOTSTEPS AFTER SERVICE IN THE MARINE CORPS AND HE INTENDED TO JOIN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THIS PAST FRIDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL PLAYERS FROM HUNTERS IN. EXCUSE ME. THIS PAST FRIDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL PLAYERS FROM HUNTERS ALMA MATER LOOKING INTO HIGH SCHOOL WHERE HIS SISTER TRINITY IS A SENIOR PROBABLY CARRIED AMERICAN FLAGS ONTO THE FIELD IN HIS MEMORY. HUNTER'S PARENTS SHARED THE FOLLOWING WITH ME ABOUT THEIR BEAUTIFUL SUN. HUNTER WAS A HAPPY GOOD ALL AMERICAN KID HE ALWAYS SEEMED MORE MATURE THAN KIDS AROUND HIM AND WE WOULD OFTEN SAY HUNTER HAD AN OLD SOUL. HE LOVED TO PLAY SOCCER HE LOVED TO WATCH ALL THE STAR WARS MOVIES UNTIL HE COULD RECITE JUST ABOUT EVERY LINE INTO THE BACKGROUND STORIES OF EACH CHARACTER. HUNTER LOVED HIS BROTHER ALLEN AND HIS SISTER TRINITY. AND WOULD DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT THEM. HE ALWAYS ENCOURAGED THEM IN THEIR SCHOOL WORK SPORTS IN ALL THEIR ENDEAVORS. HUNTER HAD A WAY OF CONNECTING WITH EVERYONE HE MET TEACHERS FRIENDS AND CO WORKERS WERE OFFERING OFTEN INQUIRE ABOUT HUNTER AND ASK HOW HE WAS DOING. HE ALWAYS SEEM TO LEAVE A VERY LASTING IMPRESSION. AS A TEENAGER IT WAS APPARENT TO ALL HUNTER WAS COMMITTED TO LIVING A LIFE OF SERVICE HE THRIVED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMY AT THE LOOKING TO HIGH SCHOOL AND ONCE HE JOINED THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S EXPLORER PROGRAM. HUNTER VOLUNTEERED FOR ALL EVENTS NO MATTER HOW TIRED OR HOW CHAOTIC HIS SCHEDULE WAS. SOMETIMES IT ASKED THE FAMILY TO ADJUST PLANS IN ORDER FOR HIM TO MAKE AN EVENT. AFTER HIGH SCHOOL HUNTER JOINED THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS AND BLOSSOMED EVEN MORE. HE ENJOYED TRAINING THE WORKING OUT IN PERFECTING HIS CRAFT. BUT HE ALWAYS MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE TO HIS PEERS AND ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO NEEDED HELP. AS A STUDENT AND EXPLORE AND AS A MARINE HUNTER VOLUNTEERED TO HELP HIS NEIGHBORS HIS COMMUNITY AND FRIENDS AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD IT ANY OTHER WAY. HE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE A LIFE OF SERVICE AND DIED PROTECTING VULNERABLE CHILDREN FACING AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE. THEY SAY ONCE A MARINE ALWAYS A MARINE AND HUNTER WILL FOREVER BE A PROUD AND HONORABLE MARINES. THE LAST PART OF THE MARINE CORPS HYMN. SAYS. I'M NOT GOING TO SING IT. HERE'S HEALTH TO YOU AND TO OUR CORE WHICH WE ARE PROUD TO SERVE IN MANY OF STRIFE WE FIGHT FOR LIFE AND NEVER LOST OUR NERVE. IF THE ARMY AND THE NAVY EVER LOOK ON HEAVEN'S SCENES. THEY WILL FIND THESTREETS ARE GUARDED. BY UNITED STATES MARINES. I ASK THAT WE JOURNEY IN HIS MEMORY THANK YOU.

SECTOR PLEASE RE ASSEMBLY BILL AT THREE THIRTY THREE BY SENATOR CAN LONGER AN ACT RELATING TO CRIMINAL GANGS SOONER COME OVER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB THREE THREE THREE THE STEP FORWARD ACT WHICH SEEKS TO BRING DUE PROCESS TO OUR GANG ENHANCEMENT STATUTE THISBILL IS ALSO A CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE POLICY. RECOMMENDATION CURRENTLY GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE OFTEN USED AS PROPORTIONATELY AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR AND HAVE RESULTED IN A SYSTEMIC CRIMINALIZATION. OF CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES OUR GANG ENHANCEMENTS STATUTES HAVE VAGUE DEFINITIONS WEAK STANDARDS OF PROOF AND ARE PERHAPS THE MOST RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY PARTOF OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. 92% OF PEOPLE WITH GANG ENHANCEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA OR PEOPLE OF COLOR. EIGHTY THREE THREE THREE MAKES CHANGES TO THE LAW THAT WILL REDUCE PROSECUTORIAL OVER REACH IN CRIMINAL CASES. IT ALSO MAKES THE STANDARDS FOR pMORE TRANSPARENT RE ENGINEERING GANG ENHANCEMENTS TO FUNCTION AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED. THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO MAKE THE APPLICATION OF A GANG ENHANCEMENT IMPOSSIBLE IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE APPLICATION OF A GANG ENHANCEMENT. RATHER IT REQUIRES THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BE PROVIDED IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE WAS ACTUALLY COMMITTED ON BEHALF OF THE GAME. THE SENSIBLE CHANGE WILL ENSURE THAT GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE APPLIED. TO THE MOST SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENSES AND ACT IF YOU CHARGE A GANG ENHANCEMENT YOU CAN PROVE. THAT ENHANCEMENT IS TRUE. BY ADDRESSING SEVERAL DAMAGING EFFECTS OF GANG EVIDENCE AT TRIAL IN NARROWING THE APPLICABILITY OF SUCH EVIDENCE AB THREE THREE THREE TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AT UNDOING SOME OF THE HARM CAUSED BY CURRENT CURRENT GANG ENHANCEMENT. STATUTES THIS BILL. WHAT HAVING A GHOST. WE HAVE TO A NUMBER OF. AMENDMENTS THROUGH EVERY PORTION OF THIS PROCESS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR NELSON. BUT FIRST LATER ON THE SENATE FIVE URGE A NO VOTE. THE GANG AND GANG ACTIVITY IS A GANG AND GANG ACTIVITY OTHER RAPPERS. IN AMERICA TODAY AND IN CALIFORNIA TODAY AND THEY HAVE BEEN INDEED FOR DECADES. AND CROSSING OUR BORDERS ARE NOW OR DOZENS MORE COMING IN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES GANGS. THE PREDATORS WHO DID WE GIVE THE DEPREDATIONS UPON OUR CITIZENS. FROM LOS ANGELES TO THE TINY LITTLE SO AND COUNTY WE HAVE ACTIVE GAME GO. UNDER VIOLENT WHATEVER THE ETHNICITY OF THE GANG MEMBERS AREN'T THERE ALL KINDS OF GAMES AND I HAVE SEEN AN INTERVIEW TOMORROW. WHAT THEY ARE COMMITTING UPON OUR POPULATION. DEGREE JUST IN REVERSE. FOR EXAMPLE THE ENTRY PATHWAY. IT INTO GANGS IS TO ASSAULT OR KILL. SO THAT'S NO BIG DEAL NO HEAVENS NO NO NO WE DON'T WANNA POUR LITTLE GANG MEMBERS. WE WANT TO REHABILITATE WELL INDEED I HAVE WORKED IN MY HEART FOR THE BABIES THE CHILD THESE GANG MEMBERS WORK. AND I'VE ACTUALLY SAID THE PARENTS. WHO CAME AND SAID THAT MY GANG MEMBER COME HOME. IF I COULD PUT YOU IN AND LET THEM OUT. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN RAISED IN THE ROOM SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. BY THEIR PARENTS. THE GANG MEMBERS. THIS CREATES A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PATHWAY. YOU ASKED ME OTHER THAN A HANDFUL OF STORES THE ASIAN CALIFORNIA. IF THEY THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO HELP ALLEVIATE OR PROVOKE JUSTICE THE GANG MEMBERS WHO COMMIT THESE HEINOUS GANG. CRIMES I THINK NOT. IT BREAKS IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT END ALLOWING THE FRENCH TO DEMAND. A SEPARATE TRIAL. ONCE SHEPHERD OF ACTIVITIES THE GANG MEMBERS ENGAGING. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT IS JUST TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE GANG MEMBERS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THINK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS. THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU READ IN THE PAPER AND YOU SEE ON THE NEWS. AND SAY THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. BUT THAT'S OKAY. NO IT IS NOT OKAY. AND THIS IS NOT A PATHWAY TO JUSTICE IT IS THE DESTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. TO THE PRIVATE CITIZENS TWO LAW AND ORDER AND TO JUSTICE FOR THOSE. WHO HARM THEIR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THE SIDE I'M SENATOR BOARDS WHICH. MR PRESIDENT I RISE- ECHOING SOME OF THE THOUGHTS OF MY COLLEAGUE JUST MENTIONED. THE LINE THAT USED TO EXIST MAYBE AT ONE POINT IN TIME BETWEEN ST. FIVE ACTIVITY IN WHITE COLLAR ACTIVITIES DEFINITELY BEEN BLURRED. STREET GANGS HAVE CERTAINLY BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED OVER TIME. THEN WE USE THE EXAMPLE OF MAIL THEFT OR IDENTITY THEFT STREET GANGS ARE PART OF A PROFIT RACKETEERING ENTERPRISE. AND SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO SET SEPARATE. SOME OF THESE OFFENSES FROM THE ENHANCEMENT PROCESS YOU ARE ALLOWING THE FUNDING CAPABILITIES OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTINUE. SO WHETHER THEY'RE SELLING NARCOTICS OR ENGAGING IN OTHER TYPES OF CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT THE PROFIT COMPONENT OF A GANG IS THE BEATING HEART OF AGAIN. AND SO TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ENHANCEMENT IS TO DO AWAY WITH. UNDOING RACKETEERING IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SO I DON'T I DON'T SEE IT AS CONSISTENT THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU DEPRIVE THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT OF THE LIFE BLOOD WHICH IS THE FINANCIAL COMPONENT THAT YOU CAN ALLOW THIS TO OCCUR. ADD ON TOP ON TOP OF THIS THE OWNERS COMPONENT OF HAVING PROSECUTION. WAITRESS SEPARATE- PROVE UP- PROCEDURE TO BE ELIGIBLE TO EVEN USE THE ENHANCEMENTS TO ME THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCOMPATIBLE. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY THE FUNDING SOURCE OF GANG ACTIVITY YOU CANNOT ALLOW THE SECOND SEGREGATION OF THESE PARTICULAR OFFENSES. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. AND SEEN ON INTERCOM ORDER GEORGE CLOSE. YES THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT YOU KNOW IT'S SOME ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT A BILL. THAT DEALS WITH GANGS BECAUSE IMMEDIATELY WE LEAN INTO MOVIES THAT WE HAVE SEEN LIKE COLORS MENACE TO SOCIETY WE LEAN ON OUR OWN STEREO TYPES AND FEARS. AND BIASES AND MANY OF THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE THIS BILL DOES NOT CONDONE. ACTIONS OF GANGS OR GANG MEMBERS I DON'T LIKE GANGS I DON'T LIKE THEM IN MY COMMUNITY. I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THEM HURTING PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OR EVEN PEOPLE THAT I DON'T KNOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT THAT. THIS IS ABOUT DUE PROCESS AND THE FACT THAT WHOEVER YOU ARE WHEREVER YOU LIVE WHATEVER YOU LOOK LIKE IF YOU HAVE A LONG HAIR OR A SHAVED HEAD IF YOU HAVE TATTOOS OR NOT. IF YOU HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME OR NOT IF YOU ARE IN A GAME OR NOT. IF YOU ARE. WELL I WON'T EVEN GO THERE BUT REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU ARE IF YOU ARE CHARGED WITH A CRIME. AND YOU DON'T PLAY OUT. THE PROSECUTION HAS AN OBLIGATION TO PROVE THAT YOU COMMITTED THE CRIME. IF ANY OF YOU. I'VE HAD ALLEGATIONS LEVIED AGAINST YOU WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN TRUE OR NOT YOU WOULD WANT THOSE CHARGES COULD BE PROVEN YOU WOULD NOT WANT FOLKS TO LEAN INTO A BIAS OR A STEREO TYPE OR A FEAR OF YOU. AND LET THAT BECOME A YES OR NO QUESTION RATHER THAN TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. I AGREE MANY GANGS. HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVE. MANY GANGS ARE SAVVY AND SOPHISTICATED AND HIGHLY ORGANIZED WHICH IS WHY I QUESTIONED THE OPPOSITION'S PUSH TO SAY THAT GANGS ARE NOT ORGANIZED THAT THEY ARE I'M ORGANIZED AND FLUID. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT. I WISH THIS BILL WASN'T AS STRINGENT AS THE RECALL LAWS THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS. HEY MAN I YES YES I DO BUT THEY'RE NOT THIS IS NOT UNFORTUNATELY. THE REALITY IS. A YOUNG MAN NAMED RAYMOND. WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN A GANG. STOLE SOME BEER AND A GALLON OF MILK. HE DID NOT STEAL BACK BECAUSE HE WAS IN A GANG HE STOLE IT BECAUSE HE WAS DESPERATE AND MAKING A BAD DECISION. A GANG ALLEGATION WAS LEVIED AGAINST HIM. BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN IN A GAME THE CRIME WAS NOT BASED ON HIS AFFILIATION. DEFENSE HAD TO pCOMPARE THAT WITH TERRELL A YOUNG MAN. WHO WAS A CRYPT. WHO MURDERED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO POSTED IT ON HIS SOCIAL MEDIA. WE'RE GETTING SIGNS AND LOGOS. WHEN WAS APPOINTED WITHOUT A GANG ALLEGATIONS BEING LEVIED ON HIM HE WAS YES A YOUNG WHITE HIGH SCHOOL OR FROM PALACE THIRTIES. SO WE HAVE THAT STRY WASN'T TRUE IF THOSE TWO STORIES WEREN'T TRUE I WOULDN'T BE HERE. THE FACT THAT JAMES AND MIKE. WHO ARE ARIAN BROTHERHOOD GANG MEMBERS ACTIVELY INVOLVED. IN MURDEROUS ACTIVITIES AND SELLING MATH WHO HAVE REPEATEDLY GONE TO PRISON. WHAT EIGHT EIGHT TATTOOED ON THEIR FOREHEAD FOR HEIL HITLER. AND HAVE NEVER HAD A GANG ALLEGATION LEVIED AGAINST THEM. IF I HAVEN'T HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION WHO TOLD ME THAT QUITE FRANKLY MISSED CAMELOT OCCUR BLACK AND BROWN GANGS ARE JUST FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANY OTHER GANGS. THEN I WOULDN'T BE HERE I'M NOT MAKING UP THESE STORIES. ULTIMATELY WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO CHARGE SOMEONE PUT THE CASE. BECAUSE GOING TO JAIL FOR A LIFETIME BECAUSE SOMEONE LOOKS AT YOU AND SAYS YOU HAVE A SHAVED HEAD BECAUSE SOME POLICE OFFICER IDENTIFIED YOU BASED ON MAYBE THEIR OWN BIASES OR WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN. SHOULD NOT ALLOW YOU TO BE SENT TO PRISON BECAUSE OF A GANG ALLEGATION WITH A TERM THAT IS LONGER. THEN WHEN THE BASE CRIME IS. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT 96% OF THESE CASES. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU. THAT GANG MEMBERS DON'T DO STUFF IN THE DARK OF NIGHT AND THEN RUN AND HIDE AND SAY WELL I'M NOT IN A GAME. IF YOU'RE IN A GANG IN YOUR ACTIVE. YOU'RE PROUD THAT'S PART OF YOUR BRAND. REGARDLESS OF IF IT'S GOOD TO BE IN AGAIN I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT. BUT FOLKS DON'T PRETEND LIKE THEY'RE IN A GANG AND THEN DON'T PRETEND LIKE THEY'RE IN A GAME BECAUSE IF YOU'RE DOING IT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ONE FOR YOUR FINANCIAL GAME. FOR EXPANSION OF TERRITORY DID YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT IN WHICH CASE IT SHOULD BE PRETTY EASY TO PROVE. IT SHOULD BE PRETTY EASY TO PROVE. AB THREE THREE THREE SAYS IF YOU TELL SOMEONE THE CASE. WITH ONE TO PROCESS IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT A FAIR TRIAL SHOULD BE ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT THE COURT OF LAW. SO WE SHOULD BE DOING. PEOPLE CREATE WILL DO BAD THINGS GANG MEMBERS DO BAD THINGS. THEY DO ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AND IF THEY ARE CAUGHT THEY SHOULD BE CHARGED. YOU CAN PROVE IT YOU HAVE EVIDENCE SO FAR. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL SAYS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WILL STILL ALLOW. AND FOR ANYONE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD. EITHER DOESN'T KNOW THE LAW. OR IS TRYING TO SCARE YOU. AND THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS IT IS SO INCREDIBLY EASY TO SCARE YOU WHEN YOU SAY THE WORD GANG. I COME FROM A COMMUNITY WHERE A FAMILY MEMBER. WAS SHOT DEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND LEFT TO DIE IN HIS LIVING ROOM BLOOD OUT FOR TEN HOURS. GANG INVOLVEMENT. I WOULD NOT WANT TO PASS A BILL THAT WOULD SAVE HIS LIFE IS FORGOTTEN. BUT EVEN THAT PERSON WHO DID THAT. DESERVES A FAIR TRIAL. THAT'S WHAT THE COURT IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THE LAW IS ABOUT. LAWYERS GO INTO BATTLE WITH THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE THEIR CASE. AND IF YOU ARE GOOD AND STRATEGIC YOU WILL WIN. IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE EIGHT LARGE GANG PROBLEM. NDAS ARE TELLING ME EVERY DAY WE ARE BEING AS CREATIVE AS POSSIBLE. USING ALL KINDS OF OOLS IN OUR DISPOSAL THANK YOU LEGISLATURE TO GET FOLKS. AND THEY ARE. BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING SOMEONE AWAY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS BECAUSE THEY STOLE A GALLON OF MILK FOR THEIR BABY WHO IS HUNGRY. AND SIX YEARS AGO THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN A GANG. BECAUSE HERE IF YOU'RE IN ONE. YOU HAVE TO REGISTER AND ONLY FOREVER. REGARDLESS OF IF YOU AGED OUT OF A GAME. MANY OF US HAVE AGED OUT OF THINGS HAVE YOU AGED OUT OF A MARRIAGE AND SOMEONE COMES BACK TO YOU AND STILL HARKENS TO THAT TIME. THAT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR. IT'S AN INNOCUOUS EXAMPLE. BUT IT PROVES A POINT. EIGHTY THREE THREE THREE IS ABOUT DUE PROCESS. DO YOU THINK THAT IF YOU CHARGE SOMEONE WITH A CRIME YOU SHOULD PROVE THAT THEY DID IT. THAT IS WHAT AB THREE THREE THREE TO US I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU AND MA'AM SECTOR LET'S CALL THE ROLL ON. FILE ITEM. ONE FIVE TWO. ALAN I ARCHULETA.

SECRETARY PLEASE RATE ASSEMBLY BILL TEN EIGHTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW AN ACT RELATING TO CIVIL RIGHTS. SENIOR WINNER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT CALLING SIDE AB TEN EIGHTY FOUR- WILL RECALL REQUIRES A RETAILER WITH FIVE HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES- TO PROVIDE A GENDER NEUTRAL RETAIL SECTION FOR CHILDREN'S ITEMS ARE TOYS AND CHILDCARE ITEMS. ON IF THE RETAILER CHOOSES TO MAINTAIN THE LABELING OF KID SECTIONS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS IF THE RETAILER CHOOSES TO SIMPLY. LABEL SECTIONS TOYS OUR KIDS AND NON URGENT AND NON GENDERED WAYS- THE ADDITIONAL GENDER NEUTRAL SECTION WILL NOT BE NECESSARY IN OTHER WORDS IF THE RETAILERS WILL ONLY HAVE TO PROVIDE A GENDER NEUTRAL SECTION IF THEY MAINTAIN SECTIONS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS. HI THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHEN THE STATE DECIDED TO ADD GENDER NEUTRAL BATHROOMS- WERE NECESSARY TO ADOPT WHAT SOCIETY NEEDS TO BE FUNCTIONAL- INCLUSIVE. IN TODAY'S CULTURE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STOP REINFORCING GENDER NORMS THAT CAN BE HARMFUL TO CHILDREN. THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT APPLY TO SMALL BUSINESSES. ON AS A COVER NINETY RESTRICTIONS- HOPEFULLY LESSEN AT SOME POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE- AND KIDS START GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IN RECENT WEEKS AND WE'LL SEE MORE AND MORE ACTIVITY- WE WANT THE PROCESS OF SHOPPING TO BE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. AFTER THIS UNPRECEDENTED YEAR OF STRESS- WERE WANNA CREATE A WELCOMING PLACE FOR ALL CHILDREN- MOVING AWAY FROM STEREOTYPES LIKE BLUE IS FOR BOYS AND PINK IS FOR GIRLS- THE DAUGHTER OF. A DAUGHTER OF THE ALTAR STAFF WAS WALKING THROUGH THE PARK AND STORE RECENTLY- AND SAID MOM I KNOW YOU WILL LET ME SHOP AND THE BOYS DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I LIKE GREENS AND BLUE BETTER THAN SPARKLES HOWEVER I'VE ASKED KIDS IN MY CLASS AND THEY ALL WANT. TO AS WELL BUT SOME OF THEIR PARENTS SAY NO BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE SECTION IS LABELED FOR BOYS AND GIRLS AND QUOTE. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SPACE CITY SPACES FOR ALL CHILDREN IN TODAY'S. SOCIETY AND NOT PUSHING- AS AN FORCE SOLD SECOND. TO GENDER. WHEN A CHILD GOES INTO A LARGER STORE WITH A CARETAKER OUR HOPE IS THAT THE DOOR WILL BE BIASED BY THE LABEL BORN GIRLS AND BOYS SECTIONS- AND ONCE SETTLED ON A CHILD- TO CHOOSE WHAT THE CHILD WANTS. AND IF A BOY WANTS A SHIRT THAT'S IN THE GIRLS APARTMENT OR VICE VERSA. THERE'S OFTEN A STIGMA ASSOCIATED THAT MAKES THE CHILD FEEL JUDGED WERE UNABLE TO EXPRESS OUR DESIRE TO CHOOSE AN ITEM FROM THE PRE LABELED OPPOSITE. GENDER DEPARTMENT. SEPARATING SIMILAR ITEMS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY MARKETED EITHER FOR GIRLS OR FOR BOYS. MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE CONSUMER TO COMPARE PRODUCTS. INCORRECTLY IMPLIES THAT THEY'RE USED BY ONE GENDER IS INAPPROPRIATE- TARGET MADE HEADLINES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN IT DECIDED TO DO AWAY WITH GENDER BASED SIGNS. IN SOME DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS HOME AND TOYS IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS NOT. A NEW THING- WE ARE ALREADY SEEING SOME OF THIS HAPPENING IN THE SKY DID NOT. FALL I'M SIMPLY PUT. HOW ABOUT WE LET KIDS BE KIDS I'M NOT GONNA BE WHO THEY ARE. I RESPECT FILES FOR AN IPO. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. MELINDA'S SENATOR MELINDA BUSH FOR GEORGE THANK YOU- I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE LET PARENTS BE PARENTS AND MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE FOR THEIR KIDS ALONG WITH THEIR CHILDREN- UNLIKE THE AUTHOR I ACTUALLY HAVE CHILDREN FIVE OF THEM TO BE EXACT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS. VERY CONVENIENT FOR PARENTS WHEN THEY'RE SHOPPING TO KNOW WHERE THE CLOTHING IS FOR THEIR CHILD WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR GIRL AN APPARENT ALREADY KNOWS WHAT THEIR CHILD'S PREFERENCES IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHERE IN THE STORE PUTS IT OR THAT THEY MAKE IT GENDER NEUTRAL THE PARENT ALREADY KNOWS THIS MY GOODNESS PARKING IS- PARENTS DON'T KNOW THEIR OWN CHILDREN. AND AS STATED BY THE FLOOR JOCKEY FROM ONE RETAILER DECIDED TO DO THIS ON THEIR OWN. OKAY WELL GREAT WELL HOW ABOUT WE LET BUSINESSES MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS BASED ON THE INPUT. THEY GET FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS BUT I DON'T THINK. THAT PARENTS NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN AND TELL THEM. HOW THEY SHOULD SHOP FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THIS IS NONSENSE ORIGINAL ABOUT. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTER FOR INTERNAL. YEAH I RISE IN SUPPORT OF- AV CHANNEL FOUR AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE A PERSONAL STORY- THAT MY OWN FAMILY EXPERIENCE TO WHERE MY BROTHER WAS TAKING HIS DAUGHTER TO ONE OF THE DRIVE INS AND ONE OF THE FAST FOOD SHOPS FOR THE FOR ONE OF THE CHILDREN'S MEALS. AND THE PERSON ON THE OTHER THE MICROPHONE SAID YOU WANT A BOY TOY YEAR GIRL TOY. AND MY BROTHER JUMPED OUT OF HIS SEAT BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A BOY OR A GIRL TIGER TOYS WE SHOULD NOT BE USING GENDER SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS WE SHOULD NOT BE WE SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO EVERYONE AND SO THAT'S A REAL STORY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO DO AND SEND A MESSAGE AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TEN EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING AND SEEING ON HIDDEN WINNER WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT I'M IT IS TRUE THAT- THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE LEGISLATION MR LOW- AS FAR AS I KNOW A DOESN'T HAVE KIDS- EYES A FOREMAN'S I ALSO DON'T HAVE KIDS AND SOMETIMES THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT'S MADE WELL YOU'RE A CHILDLESS DEMAND SO HOW DARE YOU HAVE OPINIONS. ABOUT OUR CHILDREN OUR FAMILIES- BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DO KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND WHAT I KNOW THAT MY CALLING THE AUTHOR IN HIS FAMILY MR LOWE ALSO KNOWS- IS WE KNOW WHY IT WAS LIKE. TO GROW UP NOT CONFORMING TO THE WAY THAT YOUR GENDER. IS SUPPOSED TO BE. BUT THIS IS HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AS A CHILD. AND EVEN WHEN YOU LIKE MYSELF HAD WONDERFUL AFFIRMING PARENTS SOCIETY YOUR CLASSMATES OR TEACHERS EVERYONE ELSE'S KANSEI TELLING YOU THIS IS THE WAY IF YOU'RE A BOY THIS IS HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. OR IF YOU'RE A GIRL THIS IS HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AND THERE'S NO GRAY THERE'S NO FLEXIBILITY YOU HAD BETTER DO THIS AND SO I KNOW THAT AND I KNOW THAT MISTER AND MISTER LOWE KNOWS THAT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK IN THIS COUNTRY. ABOUT CHILDREN. WHO ARE STIGMATIZED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CONFORMING TO WHAT SOCIETY IS DEMANDING THAT THEY BE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SUICIDE RATE. AMONG LGBTQ CHILDREN. PARTICULARLY TRANS CHILDREN. BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING TOLD CONSTANTLY THAT YOU MUST CONFORM TO SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE NOT. WE KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT HARM GROWING UP AS A CHILD. AND SO WE KNOW AND WE UNDERSTAND AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IT FIRST HAND AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AIBO. THANK YOU MA'AM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON FILE I DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO.

THIS DAY IN HISTORY MARKS A TURNING POINT IN OUR FIGHT FOR EQUAL TREATMENT FOR WOMEN AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS THE DAY INITIALLY STOOD TO REMEMBER REMEMBRANCE OF MANY DECADES OF STRUGGLE BY BRAVE WOMEN WHO BATTLE FOR SUFFRAGE RIGHTS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. THESE WOMEN EMBARKED ON A SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE CAMPAIGN FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO VOTE AND IN THE PROCESS LAUNCHED A CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT ISSTILL BEING FOUGHT TODAY. AND CERTAINLY THEIR HARD FOUGHT SUCCESSES ARE STILL FELT TODAY AS WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN MANY OF THE RIGHTS INCLUDING BELIEVE IT OR NOT OWNING PROPERTY THE ABILITY TO DIVORCE ON A BANK A CALL ACCOUNT AND EVEN THE RIGHT TO WEAR PANTS. OF COURSE NOT ALL WOMEN EARNED THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN NINETEEN TWENTY OTHER ETHNICITIES AND RACES HAD TO WAIT SEVERAL MORE DECADES TO GAIN FULL VOTING RIGHTS BLACK WOMEN HAD TO WAIT UNTIL NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. A PASSAGE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND LATINA WOMEN HAD TO WAIT UNTIL NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE EXTENSION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THE POLITICAL CLIMATE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED. THAT WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO TO ENSURE THAT ALL WOMEN TRULY HAVE AN EQUAL RIGHT TO VOTE. CERTAINLY THE PASSAGE OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT WAS A CRUCIAL STEP FORWARD IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. I ASK THAT EVERYONE TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A SIGNIFICANT POINT IN HISTORY. ACCOMPLISHED BY WOMEN WHO ARE NOT AFRAID TO CHALLENGE THE RULES FOR THE STATUS QUO. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

ALL EYES THIRTY NINE MILLS ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM FIFTY FOUR SENATOR CAFIERO. SHE'S PREPARED MADAM SECRETARY MARY. SENATE RESOLUTION FIFTY BY SENATOR COVER EITHER RELATIVE TO PROBATION SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT S. R. FIFTY WHICH DECLARES JULY EIGHTEENTH TO JULY TWENTY FOURTH AS PROBATION SERVICES WEEK. THIS RESOLUTION ACKNOWLEDGES THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT PROBATION OFFICERS PLAY TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES AND STATE SAFE. PROBATION IS A COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION THAT AIMS TO REPAIR REHABILITATE JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE OF THE CUSTODIAL SETTING. PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE THE NEXUS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE COMBINED EFFORTS CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN RESOURCES FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT SOCIAL SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SCHOOLS CRIME SURVIVOR ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFITS AND THE LARGER COMMUNITY. PROBATION DEPARTMENTS RECOGNIZE THAT SAFETY IN REAL REHABILITATION ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. THROUGH AN EQUITY FOCUSED LENS PROBATION PROFESSIONALS BIND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES WITH ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENHANCE COMMUNITY SAFETY AND ENCOURAGE A PRODUCTIVE ADJUSTMENT AND TRANSITION. BACK INTO SOCIETY PROBATION PROFESSIONALS ARE TRAINED EXPERTS PREPARED TO MANAGE THE TRAUMA AND OTHER DIVERSE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION THAT THEY SERVE THEIR EXPERTISE EXPERTISE. FACILITATES COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS FOR THESE REASONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THE DISCO THREAD ON THIS ITEM SENATOR NELSON. AT PRESENT LADIES DOWN THE SENATE YOU KNOW SADLY MOST CALIFORNIANS DO NOT EVEN HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF WHAT PROBATION IS ALL ABOUT. AND IT'S IMPACT AND ITS IMPACT IS IN THE ONLY INCREASED POST. REFORM OF THE PAROLE SYSTEM THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NOT PAROLE ANYMORE. WHICH MOSTLY MEANS THAT INDIVIDUALS COMING BACK INTO SOCIETY DO NOT HAVE ANY SUPERVISION DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO REHABILITATIVE SERVICES BUT UNDER PROBATION THEY WILL. AND THERE IS THAT PAROLE OR PROBATION OFFICER WHO WILL HELP ASSIST THEM DAILY. ALMOST FRENCH STAYING WITH THEIR PROGRAM SO THAT THEY DO REINTEGRATE IT IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION IT'S LONG BEEN IN PLACE IT DOES WORK AND THESE UNSUNG WARRIORS OUT THERE ARE SERVING THE PUBLIC PUBLIC SAFETY BUT THE SIMULTANEOUSLY DOING MORALS OF GOOD FOR INDIVIDUALS GETTING THEM BACK TO BE GAINFULLY PARTICIPANTS IN SOCIETY. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RATE ON THIS ITEM. HERE IN CHINO AND SINNER COPIER WHICH ARTICLES. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE OKAY THIS ITEM AS WELL AS ELIGIBLE FOR YOU KNOW AND THROW CALLS OR ANY OBJECTION TO USING A UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL HERE SCENE NINE HIGHS THIRTY NINE KNOWS IT ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES NOW ON TO FILE ITEM FIFTY SIX SENATOR TO ROSWELL. SHE'S READY MADAM SECRETARY YOU MAY READ. SENATE RESOLUTION FIFTY THREE BY SENATOR DURAZO RELATIVE TO PAIN AWARENESS MONTH AND WOMEN IN PAIN AWARENESS DAY SENATOR ALSO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES THE MILLIONS LIVING CHRONIC AND ACUTE PAIN AND THE DEBILITATING IMPACTS IT HAS ON THEIR LIVES. BY DECLARING SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS PAIN AWARENESS MONTH. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTH AS WOMEN IN PAIN AWARENESS DAY. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION AMERICANS LIVE WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND NEARLY TWENTY FIVE MILLION AMERICANS SUFFER FROM ACUTE PAIN EACH YEAR. ALTHOUGH MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY DOES EXIST MOST PAIN GOES UNTREATED. UNDERTREATED OR IMPROPERLY TREATED LEAVING PEOPLE ILL INFORMED ABOUT EFFECTIVE PAIN ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT. THE SHORTCOMINGS OF MEDICAL TREATMENT IS ALSO SOCIALLY DETRIMENTAL FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC AND ACUTE PAIN. OFTEN AS THEY CAN ALSO BE SOCIALLY STIGMATIZED AND MARGINALIZED BEING TAKEN AS CRAZY. WOMEN HAVE A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF CHRONIC AND ACUTE PAIN INCLUDING FROM COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME AND OSTEOARTHRITIS BUT- TAKEN LESS SERIOUSLY THAN THOSE CASES OF MEN. AS WOMEN ARE PERCEIVED AS EMOTIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL OR HER MONO. INTERN WOMEN HAVE HAD TO DEVELOP A NUMBER OF COPING MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH PAIN AND THIS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A GENERAL PERCEPTION. THAT THEY CAN ENDEAR MORE PAIN AND THAT THEIR PAIN DOES NOT NEED TO BE TAKEN AS SERIOUSLY. THE CALIFORNIA BASED PARTNERS FOR UNDERSTANDING PAIN SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION. IS A COALITION OF PAIN SUFFERERS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND CIVIC LEADERS INCLUDING THE FOUR GRACE NONPROFIT. LED IN PART BY CYNTHIA AND HER HUSBAND JOHN WHOSE MISSION IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING PAIN. THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES THEIR TIRELESS ADVOCACY TO PROMOTE PUBLIC AWARENESS TO THE NEED TO ADDRESS GENDER DISPARITIES IN PAIN ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT. AND THE NEED TO EDUCATE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA SUFFERING FROM PAIN I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING AND SEEING ON IT THIS ITEM AS WELL AS ELIGIBLE FOR A UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO USING A UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL ON THE SIDE OF. C. NINE HIGHS THIRTY NINE DOES IT ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES CORRECT READ MOVING BACK TO ASSEMBLY THIRD READING. AND WE'RE MOVING. TO WE'RE MOVING TO FILE ITEM ONE TWENTY FIVE SENATOR. PRESENTED BY SENATOR ALAN HE'S READY MA'AM SECRETARY YOU MAY READ. ASSEMBLY BILL SIX FIFTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AN ACT RELATING TO PRODUCT SAFETY. CINDERELLA THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE INCLUSION OF P. FIVE CHEMICALS IN A WIDE RANGE OF JUVENILE PRODUCTS SUCH AS SLEEP MATS NURSING PILLOWS CAR SEATS CRIBS MATTRESSES. THESE CHEMICALS ARE USED IN ORDER TO MAKE PRODUCTS- STEAM OR WATER RESISTANT. BY THE PRODUCTS AS SHED P. FIVE CHEMICALS OVER TIME AND THEN EXPOSE CHILDREN AND PETS IN ADULTS FOR THAT MATTER TO THE CHEMICALS- WE NOW KNOW QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE ADVERSE IMPACTS THAT THESE P. FIVE CHEMICALS HAVE. ON HUMAN HEALTH LIVER DAMAGE INCREASED RISK OF THYROID. DISEASE DECREASED ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO VACCINES. HEALTH IMPACTS CHILDREN INCLUDED SUPPRESSED IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSE SEVERE KIDNEY FUNCTION DELAYED ONSET OF MENSTRUATION. SO THERE THERE IS RESEARCH TO THAT'S INDICATING THAT THAT- HEALTH EFFECTS ARE OCCURRING AT COMMON EXPOSURE LEVELS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND DTS SEIZED ON THE PEACE PROCESS HARMFUL. HEALTH IMPACTS SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE ARE. RESTRICTING THE SALE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS CONTAINING P. FAUCET AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS. ACCESS TO PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT PRESENT A DIRE HEALTH THREATS TO THEIR FAMILIES JUST BY THEIR MERE PRESENCE IN OUR HOME. RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE REMOVED ALL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

IN SENIOR WINNER HE'S PREPARE FIRST ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM AND SURGERY TERRY YOU MAY READ ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN TWENTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AN ACT RELATING TO REAL PROPERTY. SENATOR WARNER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE- WHICH WILL INVALIDATE- DENSITY RESTRICTIONS IN PRIVATE CONFIDENCE- IF THOSE- DENSITY RESTRICTIONS DO NOT ALIGN WITH LOCALLY ADOPTED INTENSITY RULES. UNTIL THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURIES THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY- BECAUSE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW- RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WERE USED AS A TOOL- TO SEGREGATE AND REDLINE- NEIGHBORHOODS- COURT DECISIONS AND ACTS BY THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE MADE RACIALLYRESTRICTIVE COVENANTS UNENFORCEABLE. HOWEVER THESE COVENANTS OFTEN CONTAIN OTHER VESTIGES OF DISCRIMINATION SUCH AS LIMITS ON THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF UNITS- THEY CAN BE BUILT. ON THE DENSITY LIMITS WITHIN THESE COVENANTS ALSO COMPLEX FREQUENTLY WITH LOCAL ZONING CODES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW FOR MULTI UNIT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. DESPITE THE DISCRIMINATORY ORIGIN IN CLEAR CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING DENSITY RESTRICTIONS ON HOUSING COVENANTS REMAIN ENFORCEABLE AGAINST- FOR EXAMPLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL PROVIDE A PROCESS TO REMOVE RESTRICTIVE HOUSING COVENANTS AND ENSURE WE BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS WHILE PRESERVING AND STRENGTHENING LOCAL CONTROL. BY THIS MEASURE CLARIFIES THAT DENSITY RESTRICTIONS ON PRIVATE COVENANTS ARE UNENFORCEABLE AGAINST A 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT UNDER EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WHO NO LONGER RESIDE ON THE PROPERTY CANNOT USE COVENANTS TO CURTAIL MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO REMOVE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS AND OUR EFFORTS TO TACKLE THE HOUSING CRISIS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. BUT IF ANY TO SCHEDULE A DEBATE ON THIS I DON'T SENATOR OUR CULTURE. MR PRESIDENT OF WHEN WE HEARD THIS BILL AND JUDICIARY I HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT AND I'M RELUCTANTLY GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT- YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THESE COMPARISONS TO TEACH RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND IT GIVES ME A FLAVOR OF HOW. BAD THESE ARE IN WE'RE GIVING A PATHWAY TO REMOVE THESE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS BUT IT IS SUCH A NARROW NARROW PATHWAY IT HAS TO BE A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH RESTRICTED COVENANTS. WOULD WOULD REMAIN AND I WOULD URGE THE AUTHOR WHO PLACES WHO HAS SEVERAL BILLS IN THIS AREA AND OTHER ADVOCATES WHO ARE LISTENING TO TEST TO RATHER THAN ONLY I KNOW THIS THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL ONE AHEAD ARE A 100% AFFORDABLE BUT IF THESE ARE REALLY. NOT UNNECESSARY BARRIERS THAT WE HAPPEN RESTRICTIONS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE IN OUR HOUSING CODES THAT WE SHOULD WIDEN THAT. ELIGIBILITY TO READ TO- REMOVE THEM AND I THINK IT'S UNNECESSARILY RESTRICTED TO ONLY A HUNDRED PERCENT- AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHETHER IT'S RELUCTANCE BECAUSE I FELT THAT I NEEDED TO SAY SOMETHING WALLABY SUPPORTING IT THERE NEEDS. MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS ARENA. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING SOONER AND SOONER WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I CAN'T DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING- THAT THE SENATOR FROM FREMONT SAID- BUT GOD THE AUTHOR CHOSE TO FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THIS PROBLEM I HOPE WE CAN BROADEN OUT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE HIS CONFIDENCE REALLY ARE NOXIOUS- BUT THAT BILL BEFORE US TODAY IS WORTHY OF SUPPORT AND I ASK FOR YOUR AUTO.
